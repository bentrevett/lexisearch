like,\n\n00:05.200 --> 00:06.560\n oh, can you beat him in a hook?\n\n00:06.560 --> 00:07.720\n Can you beat, man?\n\n00:07.720 --> 00:10.640\n Win, win, that's it.\n\n00:10.640 --> 00:13.460\n Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.\n\n00:13.460 --> 00:16.540\n You believe the match is finished.\n\n00:16.540 --> 00:19.600\n And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.\n\n00:19.600 --> 00:20.420\n See this?\n\n00:20.420 --> 00:21.260\n Yeah.\n\n00:23.180 --> 00:24.020\n Quit.\n\n00:26.240 --> 00:29.380\n The following is a conversation with Devon Larratt,\n\n00:29.380 --> 00:32.240\n considered by many to be one of the greatest\n\n00:32.240 --> 00:34.800\n arm wrestlers in history.\n\n00:34.800 --> 00:37.080\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:37.080 --> 00:39.220\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:39.220 --> 00:40.360\n in the description.\n\n00:40.360 --> 00:44.440\n And now, dear friends, here's Devon Larratt.\n\n00:45.560 --> 00:48.060\n You are considered to be one of the greatest\n\n00:48.060 --> 00:49.960\n arm wrestlers in history,\n\n00:49.960 --> 00:52.480\n plus are one of the most charismatic\n\n00:52.480 --> 00:54.880\n and fun people to watch in arm wrestling.\n\n00:54.880 --> 00:57.320\n But let me first start with a ridiculous,\n\n00:57.320 --> 00:59.100\n the controversial opinion.\n\n00:59.100 --> 01:01.840\n I actually really enjoy Over the Top,\n\n01:01.840 --> 01:04.440\n the movie with Sylvester Stallone,\n\n01:04.440 --> 01:06.040\n where he's a trucker.\n\n01:06.040 --> 01:08.480\n It's like a father son movie.\n\n01:08.480 --> 01:10.560\n It's, you know, like a bunch of sports\n\n01:10.560 --> 01:12.240\n have the definitive movie.\n\n01:12.240 --> 01:15.920\n Boxing has Rocky, maybe folk style.\n\n01:15.920 --> 01:18.680\n Collegiate wrestling has Vision Quest.\n\n01:19.960 --> 01:20.800\n What else is there?\n\n01:20.800 --> 01:22.520\n Billiards has Color of Money.\n\n01:22.520 --> 01:26.620\n This is the sort of movie for arm wrestling.\n\n01:26.620 --> 01:28.760\n So what did Over the Top get right?\n\n01:28.760 --> 01:31.600\n What did it get wrong about arm wrestling?\n\n01:31.600 --> 01:34.200\n That was actually based off of a real story.\n\n01:34.200 --> 01:35.600\n A lot of people don't know that.\n\n01:35.600 --> 01:37.920\n Yeah, the Over the Top movie,\n\n01:37.920 --> 01:40.640\n I mean, to a certain degree,\n\n01:40.640 --> 01:41.880\n that's actually real life.\n\n01:41.880 --> 01:44.240\n Like that tournament, Over the Top, was real.\n\n01:44.240 --> 01:45.080\n Yeah.\n\n01:45.080 --> 01:45.900\n It was literally named Over the Top.\n\n01:45.900 --> 01:46.740\n Yes, yes.\n\n01:46.740 --> 01:48.480\n There was a trucker division,\n\n01:48.480 --> 01:50.120\n and the guy actually won a truck for real.\n\n01:50.120 --> 01:51.000\n His name's John Brzenk.\n\n01:51.000 --> 01:52.440\n You know who that is, right?\n\n01:52.440 --> 01:54.080\n So the actual Over the Top tournament,\n\n01:54.080 --> 01:55.720\n the trucker division, was won by John.\n\n01:55.720 --> 01:57.480\n Who is John Brzenk?\n\n01:57.480 --> 02:01.080\n He is, a lot of people talk about him as like a legend\n\n02:01.080 --> 02:03.080\n and one of, if not the greatest,\n\n02:03.080 --> 02:04.680\n arm wrestlers of all time.\n\n02:04.680 --> 02:09.680\n John Brzenk is every arm wrestler's father\n\n02:11.320 --> 02:14.600\n to a certain degree, all of us.\n\n02:14.600 --> 02:16.360\n The entire sport looks up to him.\n\n02:19.880 --> 02:21.640\n It's incredible what he's done.\n\n02:21.640 --> 02:24.840\n I mean, at 18, he won Over the Top.\n\n02:24.840 --> 02:29.480\n At 57, he just competed with me a couple months ago.\n\n02:29.480 --> 02:31.120\n Still at the world level.\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:35.720\n 18, that's 40 years of being at the top of the sport.\n\n02:35.720 --> 02:37.080\n It's incredible.\n\n02:37.080 --> 02:39.140\n He's hailed as the greatest of all time\n\n02:39.140 --> 02:41.080\n in the sport of arm wrestling.\n\n02:41.080 --> 02:41.920\n Yeah.\n\n02:41.920 --> 02:44.080\n And he doesn't, he's beaten some monsters.\n\n02:44.080 --> 02:45.280\n Oh yeah, yeah.\n\n02:45.280 --> 02:46.120\n And he doesn't.\n\n02:46.120 --> 02:51.120\n I mean, when you talk about like the evolution of the sport,\n\n02:51.120 --> 02:54.120\n he's responsible for so much of it.\n\n02:54.120 --> 02:57.680\n Like when you talk about, like a lot of times\n\n02:57.680 --> 03:00.840\n when you go back like 20 years, 30 years,\n\n03:00.840 --> 03:03.720\n a lot of us looked at arm wrestling, I think it's,\n\n03:03.720 --> 03:06.920\n I mean, as something you could kind of do.\n\n03:06.920 --> 03:08.320\n And he's the first guy who's like,\n\n03:08.320 --> 03:09.560\n if you want to get better at arm wrestling,\n\n03:09.560 --> 03:10.880\n you got to arm wrestle.\n\n03:10.880 --> 03:14.880\n And it seems so simple, but you know,\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:17.920\n he answered so many questions that all of us had\n\n03:17.920 --> 03:22.920\n about techniques in the sport, back in a pre video internet.\n\n03:25.880 --> 03:28.880\n He's been everybody's target for like 40 years.\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:31.520\n So in terms of strength, there's a power in terms of skill.\n\n03:31.520 --> 03:33.320\n What did he teach the sport of arm wrestling?\n\n03:33.320 --> 03:35.440\n So if you look, how did the sport change\n\n03:35.440 --> 03:38.720\n from 80s, 90s to the aughts?\n\n03:38.720 --> 03:41.040\n You were at the top of the world for many years.\n\n03:43.040 --> 03:45.720\n Many argue you're still at the very top of the world.\n\n03:45.720 --> 03:48.560\n But like you were very dominant, both left and right hand\n\n03:48.560 --> 03:53.560\n in, I don't know, 2008 to 2013, something like that.\n\n03:55.120 --> 03:57.760\n So how did that sport evolve to today?\n\n03:57.760 --> 04:02.760\n So it's hard for me to comment, you know, prior to,\n\n04:03.720 --> 04:06.640\n you know, when I came to the sport was kind of mid nineties.\n\n04:06.640 --> 04:08.240\n Like I've been arm wrestling my whole life,\n\n04:08.240 --> 04:13.240\n but I wasn't really involved in the sport to a major degree\n\n04:13.240 --> 04:16.160\n until probably, you know, mid nineties.\n\n04:16.160 --> 04:20.360\n But I'll say that before the mid nineties,\n\n04:20.360 --> 04:23.280\n it was really hard to get good at arm wrestling.\n\n04:23.280 --> 04:24.520\n Very difficult.\n\n04:25.680 --> 04:28.040\n Everybody was doing it wrong, really.\n\n04:28.040 --> 04:30.600\n Like it was really rare to find people\n\n04:30.600 --> 04:32.680\n who were technically good arm wrestlers.\n\n04:33.680 --> 04:35.320\n It was very underground.\n\n04:35.320 --> 04:37.280\n You know, when I got into sport,\n\n04:37.280 --> 04:39.680\n it was a flyer that came in the mail.\n\n04:39.680 --> 04:41.640\n You had to know somebody who knew you.\n\n04:41.640 --> 04:43.720\n You had to know somebody who knew somebody\n\n04:43.720 --> 04:46.480\n who knew somebody, and then you go to a club\n\n04:46.480 --> 04:49.000\n and you can't do anything with these people.\n\n04:49.000 --> 04:52.360\n And they knew how to arm wrestle.\n\n04:52.360 --> 04:56.080\n They did, but real masters were rare.\n\n04:56.080 --> 05:00.880\n And you know, then internet helped everybody.\n\n05:00.880 --> 05:04.480\n Communication, the transfer of knowledge\n\n05:04.480 --> 05:06.720\n became so much faster.\n\n05:06.720 --> 05:11.000\n People became technically, you know, invested.\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:14.760\n People started to train, sharing ideas.\n\n05:14.760 --> 05:18.240\n By, I'd say, 2000 and,\n\n05:20.560 --> 05:23.080\n well, probably around the turn of the millennia,\n\n05:23.080 --> 05:27.200\n I'd say that professional leagues started to slowly pick up.\n\n05:27.200 --> 05:31.240\n More organized, bigger productions.\n\n05:31.240 --> 05:33.400\n Started to attract more athletes.\n\n05:33.400 --> 05:35.560\n More people took it seriously.\n\n05:35.560 --> 05:39.320\n By 2010, I'd say there was another jump.\n\n05:39.320 --> 05:42.800\n More serious leagues, a little bit more money.\n\n05:43.960 --> 05:47.360\n By 2015, more major media.\n\n05:47.360 --> 05:49.520\n Like, people were investing a lot of money.\n\n05:49.520 --> 05:53.240\n Like, you know, millionaires, billionaires type of people\n\n05:53.240 --> 05:55.600\n were organizing events, setting up leagues.\n\n05:56.480 --> 05:59.360\n And yeah, I mean, the past five years,\n\n05:59.360 --> 06:01.040\n it's just blown up.\n\n06:01.040 --> 06:04.000\n The techniques, I mean, if I was to go back\n\n06:04.000 --> 06:08.400\n to when I started, you know, what took me\n\n06:08.400 --> 06:10.320\n 10 or 15 years to learn?\n\n06:10.320 --> 06:11.760\n I mean, new guys are showing up\n\n06:11.760 --> 06:13.600\n and they've got it down in like a year.\n\n06:13.600 --> 06:15.280\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n06:15.280 --> 06:18.320\n Well, the thing about it, the development of the sport,\n\n06:18.320 --> 06:21.440\n is it's, like I was telling you off mic,\n\n06:21.440 --> 06:26.440\n it's a battle of one versus one.\n\n06:27.680 --> 06:30.360\n And then that can turn into battle of nations,\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:32.240\n which, you know, there is.\n\n06:32.240 --> 06:34.840\n There's Canada, there's the United States,\n\n06:34.840 --> 06:39.840\n there's all the Eastern Europe, Russia, Georgia,\n\n06:39.840 --> 06:40.880\n all of that.\n\n06:40.880 --> 06:43.760\n That's what makes some of the greatest sports\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:46.120\n in Olympics great, like weightlifting.\n\n06:46.120 --> 06:48.920\n It's a battle of nations, not just a battle of individuals.\n\n06:48.920 --> 06:50.800\n And it's almost like these two humans\n\n06:50.800 --> 06:52.600\n represent the two nations.\n\n06:52.600 --> 06:53.960\n And I see that very much,\n\n06:53.960 --> 06:55.440\n we'll talk about your matches coming up,\n\n06:55.440 --> 06:59.720\n but there is that battle between North America\n\n06:59.720 --> 07:01.480\n and that other part of the world.\n\n07:01.480 --> 07:05.120\n Yeah, yeah, North America is very prized.\n\n07:05.120 --> 07:07.200\n You know, the North American champion\n\n07:07.200 --> 07:09.160\n is always highly sought after\n\n07:09.160 --> 07:12.400\n because they're typically the most famous.\n\n07:12.400 --> 07:16.000\n Even still when, you know, quite arguably,\n\n07:16.000 --> 07:18.560\n there's always somebody in Eastern Europe\n\n07:18.560 --> 07:20.880\n who's just monstrous.\n\n07:20.880 --> 07:23.160\n It's typically the North American athlete\n\n07:23.160 --> 07:24.760\n who's more recognized.\n\n07:24.760 --> 07:26.200\n By the way. Oh, yeah.\n\n07:26.200 --> 07:28.360\n We'll have a cup here with some maple syrup.\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:29.600\n Cheers, Lex. Cheers.\n\n07:29.600 --> 07:31.480\n We should probably show,\n\n07:32.920 --> 07:34.560\n you just downed that whole thing.\n\n07:34.560 --> 07:36.320\n No, no, no, I'm gonna sip it.\n\n07:36.320 --> 07:37.760\n I'm gonna sip it, you know?\n\n07:37.760 --> 07:39.380\n But by all means.\n\n07:41.280 --> 07:42.400\n It's really good, right? That is delicious.\n\n07:42.400 --> 07:43.360\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n07:43.360 --> 07:45.720\n That is. Canadian maple syrup.\n\n07:45.720 --> 07:46.560\n Yeah.\n\n07:46.560 --> 07:51.560\n That's a perfect July day from Canada in a bottle, yeah.\n\n07:52.240 --> 07:56.680\n So you're on a total tangent.\n\n07:56.680 --> 07:59.040\n You are known for appreciating food\n\n07:59.040 --> 07:59.960\n in all kinds of ways,\n\n07:59.960 --> 08:02.920\n but one of the things you're known for is pancakes.\n\n08:02.920 --> 08:06.920\n That is, yeah, that's gone to a crazy place in the sport,\n\n08:06.920 --> 08:08.200\n but yeah, like.\n\n08:08.200 --> 08:09.560\n Where did that originate?\n\n08:09.560 --> 08:12.760\n So, where that originated.\n\n08:12.760 --> 08:15.360\n When it went from like your actual love for pancakes\n\n08:15.360 --> 08:16.200\n to the meme.\n\n08:16.200 --> 08:19.960\n Yeah, so I think what happened was.\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:26.520\n So I had a match with Michael Todd, big match.\n\n08:26.520 --> 08:29.220\n Michael, great champion.\n\n08:30.160 --> 08:31.720\n He's another guy who's, you know,\n\n08:31.720 --> 08:34.000\n he's never gonna get off the horse.\n\n08:34.000 --> 08:36.320\n You know, he's, Jesus.\n\n08:36.320 --> 08:38.820\n His elbow is a complete disaster.\n\n08:40.600 --> 08:42.920\n Probably one of the most loved and hated guys\n\n08:42.920 --> 08:44.260\n in the sport right now.\n\n08:45.160 --> 08:46.680\n Is it because of the King's move?\n\n08:46.680 --> 08:47.880\n Yeah.\n\n08:47.880 --> 08:50.560\n Yeah, the King's move brings him a lot of hate.\n\n08:50.560 --> 08:52.800\n Not from me, not from a lot of people,\n\n08:52.800 --> 08:56.200\n but a lot of observers have a big problem\n\n08:56.200 --> 08:57.540\n with the King's move.\n\n08:57.540 --> 09:00.000\n What's wrong with being a little bit controversial?\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.000\n That's fun.\n\n09:01.000 --> 09:03.360\n You know, I get so passionate about it.\n\n09:03.360 --> 09:05.560\n I get so angry, you know?\n\n09:05.560 --> 09:06.680\n Because there's this saying like,\n\n09:06.680 --> 09:08.080\n oh, can you beat him in a hook?\n\n09:08.080 --> 09:09.240\n Can you beat, man?\n\n09:09.240 --> 09:10.840\n Win, win.\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:12.160\n That's all that matters.\n\n09:12.160 --> 09:15.360\n Just win and don't talk to me about anything else.\n\n09:15.360 --> 09:18.380\n If you can win with style, win with style,\n\n09:18.380 --> 09:21.920\n but don't talk to me about anything but winning.\n\n09:21.920 --> 09:23.200\n That's the priority.\n\n09:23.200 --> 09:24.760\n So you had this match with Michael Todd.\n\n09:24.760 --> 09:25.600\n Yeah.\n\n09:25.600 --> 09:28.360\n So I was in a terrible place.\n\n09:29.520 --> 09:31.460\n I guess it was, I get so screwed up with the years.\n\n09:31.460 --> 09:33.320\n It's 2022 now, right?\n\n09:33.320 --> 09:34.360\n No, it's 2030.\n\n09:34.360 --> 09:35.680\n What are you talking about?\n\n09:35.680 --> 09:36.520\n That's right.\n\n09:36.520 --> 09:38.240\n I think it is actually 2030.\n\n09:38.240 --> 09:39.720\n We're way ahead of schedule.\n\n09:39.720 --> 09:40.560\n Yeah.\n\n09:40.560 --> 09:41.380\n Oh, man.\n\n09:41.380 --> 09:42.220\n That's right.\n\n09:42.220 --> 09:43.060\n So when was this?\n\n09:43.060 --> 09:43.880\n This was like a decade ago or no?\n\n09:43.880 --> 09:47.120\n No, this is like a year and a bit ago.\n\n09:47.120 --> 09:48.200\n Oh, this is very recent.\n\n09:48.200 --> 09:49.580\n Very recent, yeah.\n\n09:49.580 --> 09:52.080\n So I got really sick.\n\n09:52.080 --> 09:52.920\n Is that the match?\n\n09:52.920 --> 09:54.760\n Yeah, this is the match, right?\n\n09:54.760 --> 09:55.740\n Awesome match.\n\n09:57.000 --> 09:59.560\n So this match is for the Legacy Hammer.\n\n09:59.560 --> 10:02.160\n So we invented this thing called the Legacy Hammer\n\n10:02.160 --> 10:05.700\n and Michael took it from me in, I think, 2018.\n\n10:05.700 --> 10:08.360\n And then COVID shut everything down\n\n10:08.360 --> 10:11.600\n and Michael went overseas to try and set up,\n\n10:11.600 --> 10:15.100\n because at that time, Michael was a North American champion.\n\n10:15.100 --> 10:18.640\n He beat me and he went to Dubai\n\n10:18.640 --> 10:21.560\n and he organized this great big match with LeVon.\n\n10:21.560 --> 10:23.040\n And the whole thing fell apart.\n\n10:23.040 --> 10:25.800\n Organizers, leagues, wouldn't let it happen,\n\n10:25.800 --> 10:27.520\n but there was still an ability\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:30.500\n to have a match of significance happen.\n\n10:30.500 --> 10:31.780\n So Michael's like, who do you want?\n\n10:31.780 --> 10:33.620\n And I'm like, let's give Devin a rematch.\n\n10:33.620 --> 10:36.360\n And I'm like, yeah, yes.\n\n10:36.360 --> 10:38.480\n And I was really sick at the time.\n\n10:38.480 --> 10:41.960\n I had DVT, I had pulmonary embolism.\n\n10:41.960 --> 10:45.320\n I was mentally in a terrible place\n\n10:45.320 --> 10:47.000\n and I got offered the match\n\n10:47.000 --> 10:50.300\n and I just totally turned my life around.\n\n10:50.300 --> 10:55.300\n And I committed really hard.\n\n10:57.200 --> 10:59.880\n What happened in this match, by the way?\n\n10:59.880 --> 11:01.760\n Oh, I just totally destroyed him.\n\n11:03.140 --> 11:04.800\n I just beat the piss out of him.\n\n11:08.240 --> 11:11.040\n Michael's a good friend of mine, but.\n\n11:11.040 --> 11:12.320\n Yeah, there's a lot of camaraderie\n\n11:12.320 --> 11:14.500\n when you guys talked afterwards, it's great.\n\n11:14.500 --> 11:17.240\n But we fight like brothers,\n\n11:17.240 --> 11:20.400\n so we let each other really fight hard against each other.\n\n11:20.400 --> 11:23.240\n But so I was, I knew, I mean,\n\n11:23.240 --> 11:26.360\n strength and mass, they go hand in hand.\n\n11:26.360 --> 11:29.800\n And I committed to just getting as big\n\n11:29.800 --> 11:30.800\n and as strong as I could.\n\n11:30.800 --> 11:34.000\n And literally, I was eating pancakes every day.\n\n11:34.000 --> 11:37.200\n Bacon, pancakes, every sloppy bit\n\n11:37.200 --> 11:38.760\n of garbage food I could eat.\n\n11:38.760 --> 11:40.440\n I was trying to eat healthy also,\n\n11:40.440 --> 11:42.000\n but if there was garbage food, I'd eat it.\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.340\n What do you mean, bacon and pancakes isn't healthy?\n\n11:44.340 --> 11:45.180\n What are you talking about?\n\n11:45.180 --> 11:46.080\n Exactly.\n\n11:46.080 --> 11:48.680\n But people should go watch, there's a video\n\n11:48.680 --> 11:53.680\n where you make the Canadian meal of bacon\n\n11:54.160 --> 11:57.560\n with some bacon cooking tips, water, that was interesting.\n\n11:57.560 --> 12:01.400\n And then obviously pancakes and maple syrup\n\n12:01.400 --> 12:02.240\n all over the whole thing.\n\n12:02.240 --> 12:05.120\n Yeah, you're making me very hungry.\n\n12:05.120 --> 12:08.400\n I've caused more diabetes than,\n\n12:08.400 --> 12:10.640\n probably gonna get in trouble karmically\n\n12:10.640 --> 12:12.720\n for making the world obese.\n\n12:12.720 --> 12:15.840\n You should probably write a book, The Pancake Diet.\n\n12:15.840 --> 12:18.800\n Yeah, I think I will do that one day.\n\n12:18.800 --> 12:21.720\n So you said mass and strength go hand in hand,\n\n12:21.720 --> 12:24.280\n just at a big level about arm wrestling,\n\n12:24.280 --> 12:26.320\n what's more important?\n\n12:26.320 --> 12:30.560\n Strength, power, endurance, skills, strategy,\n\n12:30.560 --> 12:33.840\n or mental toughness, how do these components\n\n12:33.840 --> 12:36.960\n all come into play in arm wrestling?\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:38.360\n They're all important.\n\n12:38.360 --> 12:41.960\n You can use everything and you can adjust your strategy\n\n12:41.960 --> 12:43.880\n based off of the tools that you have.\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:48.320\n I would say if I could pick ever just one thing\n\n12:48.320 --> 12:53.320\n to have more of, I would say that it would be strength.\n\n12:53.480 --> 12:56.280\n Gained while fighting.\n\n12:56.280 --> 12:59.120\n While actually arm wrestling, so not off the table.\n\n12:59.120 --> 13:02.160\n No, no, no, so you get stronger from arm wrestling.\n\n13:02.160 --> 13:03.920\n How do you get stronger from arm wrestling?\n\n13:03.920 --> 13:06.120\n In jiu jitsu and grappling, you can get good\n\n13:06.120 --> 13:11.040\n by training with people much technically worse than you.\n\n13:11.040 --> 13:12.920\n So with white belts and blue belts,\n\n13:12.920 --> 13:16.680\n it's actually beneficial because you get to work stuff out.\n\n13:16.680 --> 13:21.680\n But I wouldn't say it develops that intensity\n\n13:22.960 --> 13:27.920\n and power required to go against people at your level.\n\n13:27.920 --> 13:30.040\n So how do you balance that?\n\n13:30.040 --> 13:31.400\n Is it okay to go against people\n\n13:31.400 --> 13:33.160\n that are much weaker than you?\n\n13:33.160 --> 13:36.400\n Or do you really have to go against people\n\n13:36.400 --> 13:38.000\n at the same level?\n\n13:38.000 --> 13:43.000\n I think that a blended strategy is probably the best.\n\n13:44.640 --> 13:48.480\n I'd say kind of a rule is whatever you do,\n\n13:48.480 --> 13:49.840\n you get better at, right?\n\n13:49.840 --> 13:54.160\n So you wanna be kind of as precise as possible.\n\n13:54.160 --> 13:55.360\n You don't wanna get hurt.\n\n13:56.880 --> 13:58.640\n And it's just about investment.\n\n13:58.640 --> 14:02.200\n And the answer's not always the same.\n\n14:02.200 --> 14:04.240\n Things are gonna change.\n\n14:04.240 --> 14:08.480\n I am currently a big believer in what I call\n\n14:08.480 --> 14:09.960\n tower building, right?\n\n14:09.960 --> 14:14.960\n So you have to do a lot of volume to build a great tower.\n\n14:15.720 --> 14:19.760\n You need to have a ton, a ton of volume.\n\n14:19.760 --> 14:23.200\n So when you look at how to best build volume,\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:27.480\n you want to do workouts that aren't particularly challenging\n\n14:27.480 --> 14:30.720\n to make you feel good and do them so that\n\n14:30.720 --> 14:35.120\n when you add them all together, you get the biggest number.\n\n14:35.120 --> 14:40.120\n So many easy workouts a day that are specific as possible,\n\n14:41.320 --> 14:45.440\n in my opinion, is the best way to lay the foundation\n\n14:45.440 --> 14:47.040\n for an extreme peak.\n\n14:47.040 --> 14:49.920\n And precision, right?\n\n14:49.920 --> 14:53.640\n Like there's no more precise way to get strong\n\n14:53.640 --> 14:55.400\n at arm wrestling than arm wrestle.\n\n14:57.440 --> 15:00.560\n So how often can you arm wrestle?\n\n15:00.560 --> 15:02.520\n What's your training regimen?\n\n15:02.520 --> 15:07.520\n You've talked about this as the climb.\n\n15:07.760 --> 15:12.760\n What is the training process to get great at arm wrestling?\n\n15:12.880 --> 15:16.320\n Well, again, it's gonna depend on what level you're at.\n\n15:17.680 --> 15:21.600\n The answer at the beginning might not be the same.\n\n15:21.600 --> 15:25.120\n For me, a guy who's been doing it almost 30 years,\n\n15:26.160 --> 15:27.520\n I have to harvest.\n\n15:27.520 --> 15:30.720\n I have to harvest energy from clubs.\n\n15:30.720 --> 15:32.440\n I call it cosmic punch.\n\n15:32.440 --> 15:33.280\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n15:33.280 --> 15:34.400\n You were here in Austin, Texas.\n\n15:34.400 --> 15:37.480\n You are in Austin, Texas, but you were at the,\n\n15:37.480 --> 15:38.320\n what was it called?\n\n15:38.320 --> 15:40.000\n The water tank.\n\n15:40.000 --> 15:41.320\n And you had an awesome crowd.\n\n15:41.320 --> 15:42.240\n It was great.\n\n15:42.240 --> 15:43.080\n I get to watch.\n\n15:43.080 --> 15:45.120\n I got to interact with a lot of those guys.\n\n15:46.720 --> 15:49.200\n Yes, just amazing community, amazing human beings.\n\n15:49.200 --> 15:53.000\n I got to talk to Dmitry in Russian and in English.\n\n15:54.400 --> 15:55.240\n He's an engineer.\n\n15:55.240 --> 15:56.160\n His wife is an engineer.\n\n15:56.160 --> 15:59.800\n He's a brilliant dude, but also one of the toughest,\n\n15:59.800 --> 16:01.560\n I guess, guys you faced there.\n\n16:01.560 --> 16:03.760\n But you faced, I don't know how many people.\n\n16:03.760 --> 16:05.640\n It must've been hundreds of matches.\n\n16:05.640 --> 16:07.320\n So the bar was full.\n\n16:07.320 --> 16:10.200\n Yeah, and that for me is a perfect training scenario.\n\n16:10.200 --> 16:11.040\n Yeah.\n\n16:11.040 --> 16:13.680\n So if I go in and just kind of be,\n\n16:13.680 --> 16:15.400\n I'm like a lightning rod,\n\n16:15.400 --> 16:20.400\n and I just absorb everything that I can get from people,\n\n16:20.480 --> 16:24.520\n all their effort, that's perfect.\n\n16:24.520 --> 16:25.360\n That's perfect.\n\n16:25.360 --> 16:28.640\n I'm lucky because I'm in a place that I can handle it.\n\n16:29.720 --> 16:34.720\n If I was losing or failing, this would not be optimal.\n\n16:35.040 --> 16:37.000\n But because I'm strong enough,\n\n16:37.000 --> 16:39.480\n I've been doing it long enough that I can kind of absorb it\n\n16:39.480 --> 16:42.600\n without damaging me, this is perfect.\n\n16:42.600 --> 16:43.840\n This is perfect.\n\n16:43.840 --> 16:47.920\n I typically, when I'm training up for a very serious match,\n\n16:47.920 --> 16:51.880\n I'll try and do that three or four times a week.\n\n16:51.880 --> 16:54.360\n And then the days in between,\n\n16:54.360 --> 16:58.560\n I will just do blood flow rehab, blood flow rehab.\n\n16:58.560 --> 17:01.280\n I will never hit a PR, a record.\n\n17:01.280 --> 17:03.040\n I'll never do it anymore.\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:04.300\n I don't do it.\n\n17:04.300 --> 17:05.140\n I used to.\n\n17:05.140 --> 17:06.880\n A lot of things change, and that's why I say\n\n17:06.880 --> 17:08.760\n there's a lot of ways to do it.\n\n17:08.760 --> 17:12.520\n This is currently a system that's working very well for me.\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:16.960\n So when you say PR, you're not aggressively chasing a peak.\n\n17:16.960 --> 17:19.000\n You're just building and building and building.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:19.840\n Yeah.\n\n17:19.840 --> 17:24.000\n My only peak that I care about is for this cycle,\n\n17:24.000 --> 17:25.380\n the 25th of June.\n\n17:25.380 --> 17:26.940\n That's my only PR.\n\n17:26.940 --> 17:29.560\n Let's talk about the 25th of June.\n\n17:29.560 --> 17:30.760\n Oh, yeah.\n\n17:30.760 --> 17:35.760\n Let's talk about Levan Siginashvili, the Georgian Hulk.\n\n17:39.120 --> 17:42.500\n Question number one, is it possible to beat him?\n\n17:42.500 --> 17:47.500\n He is widely acknowledged as the most powerful person\n\n17:49.720 --> 17:51.640\n in arm wrestling today.\n\n17:51.640 --> 17:52.860\n Is he beatable?\n\n17:52.860 --> 17:54.940\n And if so, how?\n\n17:54.940 --> 17:56.340\n Everybody's beatable.\n\n17:56.340 --> 17:57.280\n Everybody's beatable.\n\n17:57.280 --> 17:58.780\n Levan is incredible.\n\n17:58.780 --> 18:03.780\n He is what this modern peak of arm wrestling represents.\n\n18:07.180 --> 18:08.780\n So for people who are just listening,\n\n18:08.780 --> 18:11.540\n we also have an overlay of a video\n\n18:11.540 --> 18:14.800\n of Levan going against Vitaliy Levin,\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:18.860\n another top three person in the world, perhaps,\n\n18:18.860 --> 18:20.400\n in arm wrestling.\n\n18:20.400 --> 18:23.700\n And Levan's the guy on the right, just big.\n\n18:23.700 --> 18:25.580\n I love it.\n\n18:25.580 --> 18:28.800\n And the aggression, I mean, actually,\n\n18:28.800 --> 18:31.320\n sort of underneath it all, he seems to be a teddy bear,\n\n18:31.320 --> 18:36.320\n but when he turns it on, it's raw power.\n\n18:36.540 --> 18:38.020\n He's the full package.\n\n18:38.020 --> 18:41.000\n Levan is, he represents the pinnacle.\n\n18:42.220 --> 18:44.060\n There's Dennis in the background.\n\n18:44.060 --> 18:46.080\n He's like, I wanna be back in there.\n\n18:47.380 --> 18:49.820\n Levan has a lot of bases covered.\n\n18:49.820 --> 18:54.180\n He's, I mean, he's curling 300 pounds with one arm.\n\n18:54.180 --> 18:58.060\n I mean, the strength that he shows for arm wrestling\n\n19:00.660 --> 19:02.980\n is so far ahead of the field.\n\n19:02.980 --> 19:04.840\n He's very, very strong.\n\n19:07.020 --> 19:10.420\n But it's absolutely possible.\n\n19:10.420 --> 19:11.560\n It's absolutely possible.\n\n19:11.560 --> 19:14.180\n The one thing that I'm confident about,\n\n19:14.180 --> 19:16.120\n well, I'd say there's two things.\n\n19:16.120 --> 19:18.180\n The two things I'm confident about\n\n19:18.180 --> 19:21.180\n is that I have more experience than he does.\n\n19:21.180 --> 19:24.180\n And experience counts for a lot.\n\n19:25.300 --> 19:30.300\n The other thing is my ability to breathe and recover.\n\n19:31.860 --> 19:36.860\n So if ever there's an opportunity for the tide to turn,\n\n19:37.480 --> 19:40.140\n that's, I think, where you'll never get it back.\n\n19:40.140 --> 19:45.140\n So I think if I can somehow find a hole in his game,\n\n19:45.180 --> 19:46.940\n then, yeah.\n\n19:46.940 --> 19:51.380\n So you want to hold off the initial assault of power\n\n19:51.380 --> 19:56.380\n and then worm out and to find the hole.\n\n19:56.420 --> 20:00.420\n And then, how much of that is mental?\n\n20:00.420 --> 20:03.260\n How much of it is just the physical ability to do\n\n20:03.260 --> 20:06.240\n for your muscles to have the endurance to hold off?\n\n20:08.060 --> 20:11.320\n I like to make the sport bigger.\n\n20:11.320 --> 20:15.600\n And a lot of things that most arm wrestlers\n\n20:15.600 --> 20:17.680\n believe the sport is,\n\n20:17.680 --> 20:19.760\n I always try and push those boundaries.\n\n20:20.760 --> 20:25.200\n So there is definitely a mental aspect to it\n\n20:25.200 --> 20:26.440\n when you're faced with something\n\n20:26.440 --> 20:28.040\n that you've never seen before.\n\n20:28.840 --> 20:33.080\n That's when things like experience comes in.\n\n20:33.080 --> 20:35.120\n He can become surprised.\n\n20:35.120 --> 20:39.320\n Where what's a surprise for him is routine for me.\n\n20:39.320 --> 20:43.000\n So my adjustments will be more precise, more accurate.\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:46.720\n Yeah, that's how I get in.\n\n20:46.720 --> 20:47.920\n That's how I get in.\n\n20:47.920 --> 20:49.720\n Yeah, I play a dirty game.\n\n20:49.720 --> 20:51.360\n You know?\n\n20:51.360 --> 20:54.360\n So some of it, how important is confidence\n\n20:54.360 --> 20:57.360\n in the progression of the match?\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:02.200\n Is there ups and downs of confidence?\n\n21:02.200 --> 21:05.320\n Like, holy shit, I actually have a chance to win this.\n\n21:05.320 --> 21:07.400\n Holy shit, I'm winning this, you're done.\n\n21:07.400 --> 21:09.560\n There's some of my favorite moments.\n\n21:09.560 --> 21:11.200\n I don't know if those are fake or not\n\n21:11.200 --> 21:12.800\n in terms of your expressions,\n\n21:12.800 --> 21:14.680\n if it's fake until you make it.\n\n21:14.680 --> 21:17.560\n But whenever you shake your head or whatever,\n\n21:17.560 --> 21:22.560\n you make it apparent that you believe the match is finished.\n\n21:22.880 --> 21:25.920\n And I wonder if that gets in the head of the other person.\n\n21:25.920 --> 21:28.840\n When you start to actually,\n\n21:28.840 --> 21:31.240\n so I'm sure you're doing things,\n\n21:31.240 --> 21:34.600\n like precise, detailed things with your hands\n\n21:34.600 --> 21:37.360\n to also indicate that you believe they're fake.\n\n21:37.360 --> 21:38.400\n They're finished.\n\n21:38.400 --> 21:40.080\n But you're facially just.\n\n21:40.080 --> 21:41.160\n See this? Yeah.\n\n21:43.640 --> 21:44.480\n Quit.\n\n21:45.440 --> 21:47.480\n Oh, that's right, because it's facing the other.\n\n21:49.480 --> 21:51.200\n So that's ultimately what the battle is about.\n\n21:51.200 --> 21:54.000\n It's like, you're done.\n\n21:54.000 --> 21:55.880\n You might as well give up.\n\n21:55.880 --> 21:59.920\n Commitment is so important in anything that you do, right?\n\n21:59.920 --> 22:04.760\n Like, I always kind of try and bring things\n\n22:04.760 --> 22:08.480\n to a level of commitment that's uncommon.\n\n22:08.480 --> 22:11.920\n I think that that's a lot of reasons why I do well,\n\n22:11.920 --> 22:15.760\n is because I just get so committed in the whole process.\n\n22:15.760 --> 22:19.520\n And by the time that I actually show up to fight,\n\n22:19.520 --> 22:22.320\n I sometimes just wish that they would kill me.\n\n22:22.320 --> 22:24.040\n I wish that they would,\n\n22:24.040 --> 22:27.160\n because that's how far I want to go.\n\n22:27.160 --> 22:30.680\n People talk about like, how committed are you to the match?\n\n22:30.680 --> 22:32.440\n If you're committed to the match and you lose,\n\n22:32.440 --> 22:34.760\n you should be hurt.\n\n22:34.760 --> 22:39.320\n I'm often unhappy when I lose a match\n\n22:39.320 --> 22:40.440\n and I don't have an injury.\n\n22:40.440 --> 22:42.120\n I'm like, damn, what the fuck?\n\n22:42.120 --> 22:43.680\n I shoulda.\n\n22:43.680 --> 22:46.200\n I feel like I didn't commit, you know?\n\n22:47.560 --> 22:50.320\n I don't know if you know Dan Gable as the wrestler.\n\n22:50.320 --> 22:51.720\n Oh yeah, he was on.\n\n22:51.720 --> 22:52.880\n He was on the podcast? Yeah.\n\n22:52.880 --> 22:53.720\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n22:55.120 --> 22:56.960\n He talked about his whole career.\n\n22:56.960 --> 23:01.960\n He dreamed of working so hard that he can't get off the mat.\n\n23:01.960 --> 23:03.560\n By himself.\n\n23:03.560 --> 23:08.120\n And he's disappointed ultimately at the end of his career\n\n23:08.120 --> 23:10.120\n because he was always able to get off the mat\n\n23:10.120 --> 23:11.520\n on his own accord.\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:15.160\n So he wants to, yeah, leave it all on the mat\n\n23:15.160 --> 23:16.960\n just from exhaustion.\n\n23:16.960 --> 23:19.320\n So that's what commitment looks like.\n\n23:19.320 --> 23:21.440\n What is this process, what is this climb\n\n23:21.440 --> 23:26.440\n for probably the toughest match of your career?\n\n23:26.480 --> 23:31.480\n I would say the most epic match in arm wrestling history.\n\n23:31.480 --> 23:33.680\n I mean, it's really building up.\n\n23:33.680 --> 23:36.440\n You are, as you said, North America.\n\n23:36.440 --> 23:41.440\n That's, I mean, I think by accounts of many\n\n23:41.760 --> 23:43.720\n you're one of the greatest arm wrestlers ever.\n\n23:43.720 --> 23:47.240\n He is one of the scariest arm wrestlers ever.\n\n23:47.240 --> 23:50.160\n And so this match, by the way, where's it happening?\n\n23:50.160 --> 23:51.880\n It'll be in Dubai. In Dubai.\n\n23:51.880 --> 23:55.440\n June, so what does the climb look like?\n\n23:55.440 --> 24:01.440\n The climb for me, what I have to change in my life always,\n\n24:01.560 --> 24:04.000\n people talk about being a professional.\n\n24:04.000 --> 24:06.000\n I've always loved the sport.\n\n24:06.000 --> 24:10.440\n I've loved it like crazy, but to me,\n\n24:10.440 --> 24:15.440\n the path is about simplicity and removal of distractions.\n\n24:18.640 --> 24:23.640\n I do better and better the more I get rid of everything,\n\n24:23.640 --> 24:30.320\n nothing else, so that my life is just the goal,\n\n24:30.320 --> 24:32.880\n just the target and everything else is off the table.\n\n24:32.880 --> 24:37.880\n And that's where I need to get to, where there's nothing.\n\n24:38.160 --> 24:39.640\n There's nothing between me and him.\n\n24:39.640 --> 24:42.320\n And every single day you're putting in the volume.\n\n24:42.320 --> 24:44.320\n Every day, all day.\n\n24:44.320 --> 24:45.360\n Now you said you worked out.\n\n24:45.360 --> 24:49.080\n So yesterday you did hundreds of arm wrestling matches.\n\n24:49.080 --> 24:51.280\n And then today you said in the morning you still worked out.\n\n24:51.280 --> 24:52.400\n So what was that workout?\n\n24:52.400 --> 24:56.800\n So you're mixing up stuff where you're doing weights also?\n\n24:56.800 --> 25:00.360\n This morning, I try to really focus\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:03.240\n on what's administratively easy.\n\n25:03.240 --> 25:06.240\n That's a big part of me, everything I do.\n\n25:06.240 --> 25:08.680\n So I just travel with bands.\n\n25:08.680 --> 25:13.080\n Yeah, I got bands with me and it's rehabilitative in nature.\n\n25:13.080 --> 25:17.080\n So I'm really focusing on blood flow,\n\n25:17.080 --> 25:20.440\n feeling good, doing proper movements,\n\n25:20.440 --> 25:23.040\n but yeah, it's just a band workout in the hotel room.\n\n25:23.040 --> 25:24.440\n What does a band workout look like?\n\n25:24.440 --> 25:26.640\n So are you doing the arm wrestling movement?\n\n25:26.640 --> 25:27.680\n Oh, you see that?\n\n25:27.680 --> 25:28.680\n See what you did there?\n\n25:28.680 --> 25:30.560\n What's that?\n\n25:30.560 --> 25:31.520\n Yeah, it's you.\n\n25:31.520 --> 25:32.520\n You want to bring him in.\n\n25:32.520 --> 25:38.160\n Yeah, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up into your center.\n\n25:38.160 --> 25:40.800\n You think what can you control out here?\n\n25:40.800 --> 25:43.200\n No, you bring everything close.\n\n25:43.200 --> 25:43.720\n That's it.\n\n25:43.720 --> 25:44.760\n Don't worry about pinning.\n\n25:44.760 --> 25:46.880\n Pinning happens once it's close to you.\n\n25:46.880 --> 25:50.120\n Pinning is, people always think about pinning.\n\n25:50.120 --> 25:51.420\n Don't think about pinning.\n\n25:51.420 --> 25:53.240\n How much of the body is a part of this, too?\n\n25:53.240 --> 25:55.400\n Like the core, the torso,\n\n25:56.800 --> 25:59.200\n because it feels like there's that almost like\n\n25:59.200 --> 26:01.400\n Mike Tyson punch power, right?\n\n26:01.400 --> 26:02.240\n Yeah.\n\n26:02.240 --> 26:06.320\n Does it come from the hips, too, and the legs?\n\n26:06.320 --> 26:08.840\n It's definitely the whole body.\n\n26:08.840 --> 26:10.300\n It's definitely the whole body.\n\n26:10.300 --> 26:12.720\n Like everything is working.\n\n26:12.720 --> 26:14.740\n You're connected to the table at times,\n\n26:14.740 --> 26:15.580\n as far as your base.\n\n26:15.580 --> 26:17.540\n Sometimes your base is your feet,\n\n26:17.540 --> 26:20.480\n but a lot of times you can base off the table.\n\n26:20.480 --> 26:24.040\n So you can base off your hips, but I'll tell you,\n\n26:24.040 --> 26:27.360\n no arm wrestler cares about doing squats.\n\n26:27.360 --> 26:29.360\n No arm wrestler is doing planks.\n\n26:29.360 --> 26:30.200\n Okay?\n\n26:30.200 --> 26:34.040\n It's all about the forearm and the actions of the hand.\n\n26:34.040 --> 26:36.240\n That's always the limiting factor.\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:38.360\n You look at a guy like Oleg Zakh.\n\n26:38.360 --> 26:39.740\n Okay, do you know this guy?\n\n26:39.740 --> 26:40.580\n Oleg Zakh.\n\n26:40.580 --> 26:41.400\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:42.240\n Marvelous.\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:43.440\n He's a total hell boy.\n\n26:43.440 --> 26:47.360\n He's my inspiration to what I call pumpkin training.\n\n26:47.360 --> 26:48.200\n But.\n\n26:48.200 --> 26:49.360\n What's pumpkin training?\n\n26:50.520 --> 26:51.700\n Probably we'll get into that,\n\n26:51.700 --> 26:53.680\n but I only train my right arm.\n\n26:53.680 --> 26:54.680\n That's it.\n\n26:54.680 --> 26:56.080\n Yeah, with homework.\n\n26:56.080 --> 27:00.880\n But back to full body, it is full body.\n\n27:00.880 --> 27:04.000\n My good friend Matt Mask, when he arm wrestled me,\n\n27:04.000 --> 27:09.000\n he actually blew his internal abductor in his leg.\n\n27:09.080 --> 27:11.120\n So yeah, people walk away from tournament.\n\n27:11.120 --> 27:13.480\n Their calves can be sore sometimes.\n\n27:13.480 --> 27:14.760\n You know, it happens.\n\n27:14.760 --> 27:16.880\n But no, oh, there he is right there.\n\n27:16.880 --> 27:17.720\n Yeah.\n\n27:17.720 --> 27:19.920\n Oleg, he is a real life hell boy.\n\n27:20.880 --> 27:23.440\n He's like 170 pounds there.\n\n27:23.440 --> 27:24.280\n Look at his arm.\n\n27:24.280 --> 27:25.520\n Look at his arm.\n\n27:25.520 --> 27:26.660\n Crazy.\n\n27:26.660 --> 27:28.040\n Yeah.\n\n27:28.040 --> 27:29.580\n Yeah, he's totally crazy.\n\n27:29.580 --> 27:30.960\n That's you doing left right there.\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:33.600\n So by the way, Levan, you're going right.\n\n27:33.600 --> 27:34.660\n Yeah.\n\n27:34.660 --> 27:36.160\n Yeah.\n\n27:36.160 --> 27:39.540\n So can you say more about the mental side?\n\n27:39.540 --> 27:42.240\n Are you visualizing what it takes to beat him?\n\n27:42.240 --> 27:44.240\n Are you trying to get in his head?\n\n27:44.240 --> 27:45.840\n All of these things.\n\n27:45.840 --> 27:48.340\n So do you think it's possible to get in his head?\n\n27:50.720 --> 27:52.780\n There's definitely strategies that you can do\n\n27:52.780 --> 27:55.440\n depending on who it is you're facing.\n\n27:55.440 --> 27:58.040\n It's very good to know who it is you're fighting\n\n27:58.040 --> 28:00.620\n and choose the correct strategy mentally.\n\n28:02.360 --> 28:06.480\n But I always follow a process\n\n28:06.480 --> 28:09.120\n when it comes to my mental preparation.\n\n28:09.120 --> 28:11.680\n When I'm far away from an event,\n\n28:11.680 --> 28:15.440\n I just always build up my opponent,\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:18.240\n build them, I build them, I respect them.\n\n28:18.240 --> 28:21.520\n To a point where I almost start to fear them\n\n28:21.520 --> 28:23.520\n and start to believe that they'll beat me.\n\n28:23.520 --> 28:27.160\n And this is a very vital part of my preparation.\n\n28:27.160 --> 28:29.520\n And that's where I am right now with Levan.\n\n28:29.520 --> 28:32.300\n I just build them up into this thing that scares me.\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:35.840\n And it forces me to be responsible,\n\n28:37.040 --> 28:39.800\n because I don't want to lose, I want to win.\n\n28:40.980 --> 28:42.920\n So the greater my opponent,\n\n28:42.920 --> 28:46.060\n the greater I can build their worth in my mind,\n\n28:46.060 --> 28:47.560\n the more motivation it gives me.\n\n28:49.320 --> 28:52.860\n Then there comes a point when it changes.\n\n28:53.720 --> 28:56.860\n And then I start to degrade them.\n\n28:56.860 --> 29:00.020\n And yeah, that's when it normally starts to get fun.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:04.680\n And normally by the time I face them,\n\n29:05.760 --> 29:07.880\n I just try and completely dominate\n\n29:07.880 --> 29:10.720\n from every interaction from start to finish.\n\n29:10.720 --> 29:13.700\n So, yeah.\n\n29:13.700 --> 29:17.180\n When in the actual moment of the match,\n\n29:17.180 --> 29:19.620\n like in the moments leading up to it,\n\n29:19.620 --> 29:21.060\n what's the feeling?\n\n29:21.060 --> 29:26.060\n Is it fear, is it confidence, anxiety?\n\n29:26.540 --> 29:28.520\n What's going through your mind?\n\n29:29.420 --> 29:33.620\n I love to fight, I love it, I always have.\n\n29:33.620 --> 29:38.620\n There's every day where you have the distractions of life,\n\n29:42.460 --> 29:45.020\n and then there's really living in the moment.\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:46.500\n It's whatever you love to do,\n\n29:46.500 --> 29:48.600\n and that's when you can really be free.\n\n29:49.860 --> 29:51.220\n I'm free when I'm fighting.\n\n29:52.100 --> 29:56.020\n So you put me in a good fight, and I just love it.\n\n29:56.020 --> 29:57.260\n And I don't think about the past,\n\n29:57.260 --> 29:58.380\n I don't think about the future,\n\n29:58.380 --> 30:00.660\n I just think about killing that dude in front of me,\n\n30:00.660 --> 30:02.700\n and I enjoy that.\n\n30:02.700 --> 30:04.780\n And just being intensely in the moment.\n\n30:04.780 --> 30:05.620\n That's it.\n\n30:05.620 --> 30:08.380\n Just right there, just fighting as hard as I can.\n\n30:08.380 --> 30:10.060\n Do you study the opponent?\n\n30:10.060 --> 30:12.420\n Have you, for this particular match,\n\n30:12.420 --> 30:14.700\n do you study videos of LeVon?\n\n30:14.700 --> 30:17.640\n I've seen everything.\n\n30:17.640 --> 30:20.020\n I've read everything.\n\n30:20.020 --> 30:21.980\n I get opinions from other people.\n\n30:22.820 --> 30:25.340\n I watch very closely, yeah.\n\n30:25.340 --> 30:26.860\n What do you make of his evolution?\n\n30:26.860 --> 30:30.540\n So he's grown in size,\n\n30:30.540 --> 30:32.700\n but also you've talked about his\n\n30:34.860 --> 30:36.420\n evolution technically as well.\n\n30:37.380 --> 30:38.780\n Then studying him.\n\n30:40.700 --> 30:43.260\n Since we're in the build your opponent\n\n30:43.260 --> 30:48.260\n to be terrifying stage, what makes him great?\n\n30:49.420 --> 30:50.980\n He's very impressive.\n\n30:50.980 --> 30:54.660\n The greatest thing about him is his strength.\n\n30:54.660 --> 30:58.700\n That's the thing that sets him apart from everyone.\n\n30:58.700 --> 31:01.980\n His strength, specialized strength.\n\n31:01.980 --> 31:03.840\n Exact strength for arm wrestling.\n\n31:05.180 --> 31:06.980\n I believe it's unmatched.\n\n31:06.980 --> 31:11.980\n Can we just linger on that word strength?\n\n31:12.140 --> 31:13.860\n What does strength mean?\n\n31:13.860 --> 31:15.100\n What does it feel like?\n\n31:15.100 --> 31:20.100\n Are we talking about bicep, shoulder?\n\n31:21.700 --> 31:25.220\n Are we talking about whatever controls the wrist?\n\n31:25.220 --> 31:29.300\n Is it the, how does strength manifest?\n\n31:29.300 --> 31:32.740\n When I touch your hand, when we grab arms,\n\n31:32.740 --> 31:36.140\n I feel like fuck, that's strong.\n\n31:36.140 --> 31:36.980\n There's control, right?\n\n31:36.980 --> 31:37.820\n What is that feeling?\n\n31:37.820 --> 31:40.100\n Where does that come from in arm wrestling?\n\n31:40.100 --> 31:41.700\n When you're at the top of the world,\n\n31:41.700 --> 31:42.900\n where does that come from?\n\n31:42.900 --> 31:44.820\n So it's chains.\n\n31:44.820 --> 31:46.580\n There's chains of strength.\n\n31:46.580 --> 31:50.460\n And in arm wrestling, this is like technical strength.\n\n31:50.460 --> 31:53.460\n And we use these technical chains to fight each other.\n\n31:53.460 --> 31:58.420\n The chains that I'll talk about is,\n\n31:58.420 --> 32:00.980\n so you'll talk, remember how we talked about the post,\n\n32:00.980 --> 32:04.980\n this upwards drive, this ability to close this angle?\n\n32:04.980 --> 32:06.020\n This is a chain.\n\n32:07.460 --> 32:09.940\n It can be used, it's a technical attack.\n\n32:09.940 --> 32:12.620\n It's also an attack that can be built with training.\n\n32:12.620 --> 32:15.620\n Just the ability to just drive upwards.\n\n32:15.620 --> 32:17.740\n There's a chain where you cup, right?\n\n32:17.740 --> 32:18.940\n Cup your wrist in.\n\n32:18.940 --> 32:22.000\n Cup your wrist in and the anchor and the chain\n\n32:22.000 --> 32:25.180\n brings you right to your heart, right to your center.\n\n32:25.180 --> 32:27.940\n This chain, and this can be done at any time.\n\n32:27.940 --> 32:29.060\n There's a pronation chain,\n\n32:29.060 --> 32:32.320\n and that's to turn your thumb over, right?\n\n32:32.320 --> 32:34.040\n Turn your thumb over and you attack\n\n32:34.040 --> 32:36.340\n the person's cupping chain.\n\n32:36.340 --> 32:37.820\n And there's a huge number of muscles\n\n32:37.820 --> 32:39.180\n involved in each of those chains.\n\n32:39.180 --> 32:41.220\n And that's why I say it's a chain, right?\n\n32:41.220 --> 32:45.060\n But they're movements, and these movements\n\n32:45.060 --> 32:48.360\n you can develop in the gym or through practice.\n\n32:48.360 --> 32:51.040\n So you don't mean, so it's easy to sort of\n\n32:51.040 --> 32:54.980\n interpret strength to mean how much you curl, essentially.\n\n32:54.980 --> 32:55.820\n Yeah.\n\n32:55.820 --> 32:56.740\n But you mean the chain.\n\n32:56.740 --> 32:57.580\n It's all has to do with the.\n\n32:57.580 --> 32:59.800\n Right, and that's, I mean, people talk is it a bicep?\n\n32:59.800 --> 33:01.860\n I mean, yes, there's bicep for sure involved,\n\n33:01.860 --> 33:05.640\n but I'll always be inaccurate if I try and tell you\n\n33:05.640 --> 33:08.500\n what muscles are the, so I prefer to explain it\n\n33:08.500 --> 33:11.300\n in a movement and then everything that's involved\n\n33:11.300 --> 33:13.740\n to do that movement, right?\n\n33:13.740 --> 33:17.400\n Yeah, and Levan's movements for arm wrestling\n\n33:17.400 --> 33:19.340\n are incredibly impressive.\n\n33:19.340 --> 33:22.340\n What do you attribute to, how much of that is genetics?\n\n33:22.340 --> 33:27.340\n How much of it is some training thing he's doing?\n\n33:28.320 --> 33:32.460\n I think that Levan is very special in terms\n\n33:32.460 --> 33:36.780\n of his genetics, like not everybody can be Levan.\n\n33:36.780 --> 33:37.620\n You know?\n\n33:37.620 --> 33:38.440\n Yeah.\n\n33:38.440 --> 33:39.780\n There's not many Levans out there.\n\n33:41.100 --> 33:44.940\n But what I've encountered in the bias that I always see,\n\n33:44.940 --> 33:48.020\n like when people talk about people like Levan,\n\n33:48.020 --> 33:51.460\n they discount the other side so very quickly.\n\n33:51.460 --> 33:54.500\n And the thing is Levan rarely has to show the other side\n\n33:54.500 --> 33:56.540\n because he's so far ahead.\n\n33:56.540 --> 33:59.300\n You talk about the technical application of the sport,\n\n33:59.300 --> 34:03.460\n he so rarely needs to show it, but he's clearly incredible.\n\n34:03.460 --> 34:07.820\n If you watch his progression, he came up\n\n34:07.820 --> 34:11.100\n having very difficult technical struggles to overcome.\n\n34:11.100 --> 34:13.860\n Georgia is a great country for arm wrestling.\n\n34:13.860 --> 34:15.340\n Like there's this guy, Gennady Kvikvinia,\n\n34:15.340 --> 34:18.980\n who no one would ever say is not technical.\n\n34:18.980 --> 34:23.660\n And you know, it took him years to defeat him\n\n34:23.660 --> 34:26.940\n to a point where now it's not even a discussion.\n\n34:26.940 --> 34:28.220\n Yeah, you talk about the progression,\n\n34:28.220 --> 34:30.340\n they had a lot of battles together over the years.\n\n34:30.340 --> 34:31.180\n Yeah.\n\n34:31.180 --> 34:32.980\n It's fascinating to see the tides turn.\n\n34:32.980 --> 34:34.740\n Oh yeah, and once they've turned,\n\n34:34.740 --> 34:38.900\n it's like completely, completely different level.\n\n34:38.900 --> 34:43.740\n Yeah, I mean, he's got strength, he's got technique.\n\n34:43.740 --> 34:48.660\n Some people will argue that his technique is flawed.\n\n34:48.660 --> 34:51.780\n At times, they've shown matches where\n\n34:51.780 --> 34:54.940\n he hasn't shown the best technique, but he's still won.\n\n34:54.940 --> 34:58.060\n And I think sometimes he just plays with people.\n\n34:58.060 --> 35:01.220\n You know, like there's a famous match that he had with,\n\n35:03.060 --> 35:05.580\n they call him the Bruce Lee of arm wrestling,\n\n35:05.580 --> 35:08.180\n a guy called Angurbaev, Kurtagali Angurbaev.\n\n35:08.180 --> 35:11.660\n He's, they had a match in the top eight, great match.\n\n35:11.660 --> 35:15.580\n Kurtagali is like 220 pound guy from Kazakhstan,\n\n35:17.500 --> 35:19.900\n brilliant technician, but power wise,\n\n35:19.900 --> 35:22.580\n you know, not in the same world.\n\n35:22.580 --> 35:26.820\n And Kurtagali did well, even though he lost six nothing,\n\n35:26.820 --> 35:31.820\n he still did well, but in my opinion, Levan didn't care.\n\n35:31.940 --> 35:34.940\n Levan was like grabbing him low and just like, whatever.\n\n35:34.940 --> 35:38.540\n Like, I will show him things that he's not seen before.\n\n35:38.540 --> 35:39.380\n I will.\n\n35:39.380 --> 35:42.980\n And he hasn't competed often in this rule set,\n\n35:42.980 --> 35:44.660\n which will be a challenge for him.\n\n35:45.540 --> 35:48.020\n But yeah, what can I say?\n\n35:48.020 --> 35:50.460\n Like Levan, he's Everest.\n\n35:50.460 --> 35:51.820\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n35:51.820 --> 35:54.540\n Yeah, you are seen by basically everybody\n\n35:54.540 --> 35:56.220\n as the big, big underdog.\n\n35:56.220 --> 35:58.820\n But you're also, even in the Eastern,\n\n35:58.820 --> 36:01.480\n even, I mean, I talk to Russians a lot.\n\n36:02.580 --> 36:05.260\n You know that moment in Rocky\n\n36:05.260 --> 36:06.820\n when they start cheering for Rocky?\n\n36:06.820 --> 36:07.980\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n36:07.980 --> 36:11.020\n You're kind of the, they love you, they want you to win.\n\n36:11.020 --> 36:12.660\n And just, you know, it's not even,\n\n36:13.780 --> 36:16.500\n just the battle itself is inspiring.\n\n36:16.500 --> 36:19.780\n And it's like the culmination in your career\n\n36:19.780 --> 36:23.980\n because it's, you know, you're at the top for a long time,\n\n36:23.980 --> 36:26.860\n but it's like, it's almost like it should be over for you,\n\n36:26.860 --> 36:28.140\n but no, you're returning.\n\n36:28.140 --> 36:31.620\n It is like this big moment.\n\n36:31.620 --> 36:32.460\n Yeah.\n\n36:32.460 --> 36:34.060\n The big climb.\n\n36:34.060 --> 36:38.180\n I will be the pointy end of the spear for North America.\n\n36:38.180 --> 36:39.820\n Yeah.\n\n36:39.820 --> 36:40.660\n Ah, beautiful.\n\n36:40.660 --> 36:43.740\n Well, let's, thanks for bringing that match up.\n\n36:43.740 --> 36:48.740\n Let's talk about just the match against Dennis,\n\n36:50.180 --> 36:51.660\n your left hand match.\n\n36:51.660 --> 36:52.500\n Yeah.\n\n36:52.500 --> 36:54.980\n He's also terrifying and seen as one of the strongest,\n\n36:54.980 --> 36:58.180\n probably one of, if not the strongest\n\n36:58.180 --> 36:59.840\n left hand arm wrestler.\n\n36:59.840 --> 37:00.680\n Yeah.\n\n37:01.940 --> 37:03.860\n There's a lot to be said there.\n\n37:03.860 --> 37:06.340\n Maybe you could talk about this match at a high level.\n\n37:06.340 --> 37:08.060\n Why did you take on this match?\n\n37:08.060 --> 37:10.660\n Why did you do the left hand versus the right hand?\n\n37:10.660 --> 37:12.340\n What, can you tell the story?\n\n37:12.340 --> 37:15.060\n Okay, Dennis the Plankoff.\n\n37:15.060 --> 37:17.100\n There's so much about this match.\n\n37:17.100 --> 37:18.260\n I love Dennis.\n\n37:18.260 --> 37:19.340\n Russian guy.\n\n37:19.340 --> 37:20.540\n Yeah, Russian guy.\n\n37:20.540 --> 37:23.300\n Russian, I used to call him Dennis Chernobyl.\n\n37:23.300 --> 37:27.540\n Ah, what a monster.\n\n37:27.540 --> 37:34.540\n He kind of led, I'd say, this new era of arm wrestling,\n\n37:34.620 --> 37:37.660\n where the super heavyweight strength level\n\n37:37.660 --> 37:40.260\n has just gone through the roof.\n\n37:40.260 --> 37:42.220\n I wanted the match for such a long time.\n\n37:42.220 --> 37:44.300\n We tried to get the match.\n\n37:44.300 --> 37:45.460\n We couldn't get it organized.\n\n37:45.460 --> 37:48.660\n This is back in like 2008 to 2012.\n\n37:48.660 --> 37:50.500\n Couldn't get the match, couldn't get the match.\n\n37:50.500 --> 37:52.380\n I've always been more of a one on one puller.\n\n37:52.380 --> 37:55.140\n He was doing the tournament format.\n\n37:55.140 --> 37:57.220\n I was ranked number one in the world,\n\n37:57.220 --> 38:00.580\n and towards the end, it kind of was very undecided.\n\n38:00.580 --> 38:02.260\n I ended up getting surgery.\n\n38:02.260 --> 38:05.180\n I ended up abandoning the super heavyweight division.\n\n38:05.180 --> 38:08.980\n I went down to the 225s for a few years.\n\n38:08.980 --> 38:13.340\n WAL failed, temporarily.\n\n38:13.340 --> 38:15.820\n So the 225 pound division was scrapped.\n\n38:15.820 --> 38:21.060\n And I said, okay, I'm going to go for the big crown once again.\n\n38:21.060 --> 38:26.020\n And I started to go after super heavyweights.\n\n38:26.020 --> 38:31.020\n The 2018 season was right hand.\n\n38:33.620 --> 38:38.060\n I started to enter negotiations to have the match with him.\n\n38:38.060 --> 38:41.020\n We'd been chasing the match for 10 years.\n\n38:41.020 --> 38:42.300\n They wanted to do a left hand.\n\n38:42.300 --> 38:44.340\n I wanted to do a right hand.\n\n38:44.340 --> 38:46.300\n I just wanted to do the match.\n\n38:46.300 --> 38:47.580\n I wanted to do the match with Dennis.\n\n38:47.580 --> 38:48.780\n I wanted to meet Dennis.\n\n38:48.780 --> 38:50.980\n So people should know that you were,\n\n38:50.980 --> 38:53.540\n the right hand has always been your strongest.\n\n38:53.540 --> 38:57.500\n It has been, I mean, I had surgery in 2016.\n\n38:57.500 --> 38:59.220\n I hate to make excuses.\n\n38:59.220 --> 39:01.860\n I hate to do it.\n\n39:01.860 --> 39:05.060\n Dennis was better than me that day, even on my best day.\n\n39:05.060 --> 39:07.820\n If you had gone back my entire career,\n\n39:07.820 --> 39:11.580\n at no single day do I beat Dennis De Plankhoff in 2018.\n\n39:11.580 --> 39:14.300\n I would like to think that I could maybe do it now.\n\n39:14.300 --> 39:16.740\n But at that point, there would have been no version\n\n39:16.740 --> 39:18.980\n that could have beat him.\n\n39:18.980 --> 39:20.420\n Left or right?\n\n39:20.420 --> 39:21.060\n Right hand?\n\n39:21.060 --> 39:25.500\n No, I'm curious about the right, but left hand.\n\n39:25.500 --> 39:27.380\n So is the world.\n\n39:27.380 --> 39:28.580\n Well, it might still happen.\n\n39:28.580 --> 39:29.420\n It might.\n\n39:29.420 --> 39:36.900\n But Dennis completely destroyed me.\n\n39:36.900 --> 39:40.460\n And I learned a lot from it.\n\n39:40.460 --> 39:46.980\n I think before the Dennis match, I think I was, I don't know.\n\n39:46.980 --> 39:49.820\n I don't know exactly what words to use.\n\n39:49.820 --> 39:54.900\n Maybe I felt like my thinking was a little bit elitist.\n\n39:54.900 --> 39:57.060\n And I really learned a lot.\n\n39:57.060 --> 40:03.620\n I was really humbled that day by how far, and how professional,\n\n40:03.620 --> 40:07.860\n and how prepared Dennis was, and how seriously he\n\n40:07.860 --> 40:09.460\n took the sport.\n\n40:09.460 --> 40:14.020\n There's a mental, a slightly terrifying calmness\n\n40:14.020 --> 40:17.860\n to him, which only comes with extreme preparation, I think.\n\n40:17.860 --> 40:18.380\n Yeah.\n\n40:18.380 --> 40:23.260\n His level of dedication was extremely inspiring to me.\n\n40:26.300 --> 40:34.340\n I used to do a job where it was serious enough\n\n40:34.340 --> 40:37.780\n that the price could be death.\n\n40:37.780 --> 40:41.660\n And I arm wrestled throughout that entire period.\n\n40:41.660 --> 40:49.900\n And I always kind of looked at the cost of doing an activity,\n\n40:49.900 --> 40:55.940\n being death, limited to soldiering.\n\n40:55.940 --> 41:00.380\n And I kind of changed my mind a lot after that match.\n\n41:00.380 --> 41:04.620\n I realized that anything that you're in love with,\n\n41:04.620 --> 41:06.660\n once you get far enough down the road,\n\n41:06.660 --> 41:09.980\n and professional enough at it, it's going to kill you.\n\n41:09.980 --> 41:12.380\n Doesn't matter what you're doing, if you're crazy enough\n\n41:12.380 --> 41:15.300\n about anything, it's probably going to take your life\n\n41:15.300 --> 41:18.980\n from you in some way.\n\n41:18.980 --> 41:21.340\n And that doesn't mean you rush towards death.\n\n41:21.340 --> 41:24.140\n It's just your level of investment and level of risk\n\n41:24.140 --> 41:27.580\n can have some catastrophic effects.\n\n41:27.580 --> 41:29.460\n Bukowski, Charles Bukowski, I think\n\n41:29.460 --> 41:32.940\n has the quote, do what you love and let it kill you.\n\n41:32.940 --> 41:33.300\n Right.\n\n41:33.300 --> 41:33.940\n Like that.\n\n41:33.940 --> 41:35.420\n Right.\n\n41:35.420 --> 41:40.660\n And I understood that Dennis's level of professionalism\n\n41:40.660 --> 41:45.700\n far exceeded mine in what we were doing at the time.\n\n41:45.700 --> 41:50.420\n And I realized that I was no longer employed.\n\n41:50.420 --> 41:54.340\n I was now in the world of professional arm wrestling.\n\n41:54.340 --> 41:58.940\n And I realized that what was I doing?\n\n41:58.940 --> 42:00.580\n How serious was I?\n\n42:00.580 --> 42:02.820\n So Dennis is an incredible guy.\n\n42:02.820 --> 42:04.980\n Is there moments in that match, there's\n\n42:04.980 --> 42:07.740\n humility there, too, from him.\n\n42:07.740 --> 42:12.100\n That was a fascinating sort of, it\n\n42:12.100 --> 42:14.540\n seemed like you realized that you just hit a wall\n\n42:14.540 --> 42:16.220\n and you were not ready enough for it.\n\n42:16.220 --> 42:17.860\n It was incredible.\n\n42:17.860 --> 42:20.620\n There was so many things that I remember about the Dennis\n\n42:20.620 --> 42:21.120\n match.\n\n42:21.120 --> 42:25.220\n I mean, I remember seeing videos of somebody\n\n42:25.220 --> 42:28.180\n and then meeting them in person, it's different.\n\n42:28.180 --> 42:30.580\n I remember in the weigh ins, sorry, not the weigh ins,\n\n42:30.580 --> 42:32.940\n the standoff that we did before the match.\n\n42:32.940 --> 42:34.740\n I'm looking at him, I'm close.\n\n42:34.740 --> 42:36.660\n I'm looking at his arms.\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:42.100\n And his bicep, it looked like an ass.\n\n42:42.100 --> 42:44.500\n It was like a freaking glute muscle.\n\n42:44.500 --> 42:51.660\n Like his entire structure was so sinewy and just so strong.\n\n42:51.660 --> 42:55.180\n I was like, wow, he's physically so impressive.\n\n42:55.180 --> 43:01.500\n And I remember when I arm wrestled him at a certain time,\n\n43:01.500 --> 43:04.660\n he allowed me to kind of set my position.\n\n43:04.660 --> 43:09.300\n You can't really tell because it happens very quickly.\n\n43:09.300 --> 43:10.940\n But he let me set my position, which\n\n43:10.940 --> 43:15.340\n means I kind of got my locks in, where you can kind of really\n\n43:15.340 --> 43:18.140\n do a great hold.\n\n43:18.140 --> 43:20.340\n And he just ripped through me.\n\n43:20.340 --> 43:23.940\n So you were able to get this great position.\n\n43:23.940 --> 43:27.700\n So it was tore right through me.\n\n43:27.700 --> 43:30.740\n And the first time I ever thought\n\n43:30.740 --> 43:33.300\n that I had torn something.\n\n43:33.300 --> 43:34.780\n I thought, after the match, I'm like,\n\n43:34.780 --> 43:38.740\n geez, did he rip my chest right in half?\n\n43:38.740 --> 43:40.460\n What, did it?\n\n43:40.460 --> 43:42.140\n No, I think it was 100%.\n\n43:42.140 --> 43:43.940\n Yeah, no, I didn't actually.\n\n43:43.940 --> 43:45.980\n Nothing went purple or anything.\n\n43:45.980 --> 43:52.940\n But yeah, the strength gap was very significant with Dennis.\n\n43:52.940 --> 43:58.060\n Could he, what would it take to beat him on that day?\n\n43:58.060 --> 44:04.860\n It would take me just being a little bit stronger and more\n\n44:04.860 --> 44:06.580\n healthy, yeah.\n\n44:06.580 --> 44:10.260\n My left was not as healthy as it should be.\n\n44:10.260 --> 44:13.820\n I didn't have a full rounded technical arsenal.\n\n44:13.820 --> 44:15.780\n It takes a time after surgery.\n\n44:15.780 --> 44:17.780\n It really does.\n\n44:17.780 --> 44:22.180\n You can be good, but after a surgery, like what I had,\n\n44:22.180 --> 44:24.140\n you're probably looking at three or four years\n\n44:24.140 --> 44:26.780\n before you're starting to hit technical proficiency\n\n44:26.780 --> 44:28.780\n the way you should be.\n\n44:28.780 --> 44:31.260\n And yeah, just a bit stronger.\n\n44:31.260 --> 44:33.700\n How do you interpret the calmness on his face?\n\n44:33.700 --> 44:35.180\n Well, what is that about?\n\n44:35.180 --> 44:37.500\n Is he actually that calm or is he just trained?\n\n44:37.500 --> 44:38.860\n It's a Russian thing, I think.\n\n44:38.860 --> 44:39.340\n I don't know.\n\n44:39.340 --> 44:41.060\n I see a lot of Russians like that.\n\n44:41.060 --> 44:42.700\n They're so stoic.\n\n44:42.700 --> 44:44.780\n And I'm such a fan of Russia.\n\n44:44.780 --> 44:46.220\n I really want to go to Moscow.\n\n44:46.220 --> 44:47.500\n I've been saying it forever.\n\n44:47.500 --> 44:48.220\n You've never been?\n\n44:48.220 --> 44:49.260\n Not yet.\n\n44:49.260 --> 44:50.260\n I want to go.\n\n44:50.260 --> 44:53.460\n I want to just go and live there for a month and just train.\n\n44:53.460 --> 44:56.620\n Moscow has got such a crazy arm wrestling scene.\n\n44:56.620 --> 44:58.700\n From what I understand, they just have so many clubs.\n\n44:58.700 --> 45:00.580\n There's so many strong athletes.\n\n45:00.580 --> 45:03.420\n Just go and just lightning rod.\n\n45:03.420 --> 45:04.020\n Yeah.\n\n45:04.020 --> 45:08.020\n Have you considered doing something of that sort?\n\n45:08.020 --> 45:09.860\n It's like Rocky IV again.\n\n45:09.860 --> 45:11.460\n Oh, yeah.\n\n45:11.460 --> 45:12.980\n And lead up to June.\n\n45:12.980 --> 45:14.580\n I would certainly consider it.\n\n45:14.580 --> 45:19.660\n I've got only one trip planned at the moment.\n\n45:19.660 --> 45:22.900\n Administration is very important.\n\n45:22.900 --> 45:24.300\n What do you mean by administration?\n\n45:24.300 --> 45:25.380\n Like managing your time?\n\n45:25.380 --> 45:26.060\n Management.\n\n45:26.060 --> 45:29.340\n Yeah, the management has to be very efficient.\n\n45:29.340 --> 45:31.900\n When I'm a tourist, when I'm a visitor,\n\n45:31.900 --> 45:33.740\n a little bit of that goes down.\n\n45:33.740 --> 45:37.140\n When I'm at my home and things are familiar,\n\n45:37.140 --> 45:40.420\n I've got a really great grasp on my time.\n\n45:40.420 --> 45:41.860\n Everything's in place.\n\n45:41.860 --> 45:43.900\n Everything's perfect.\n\n45:43.900 --> 45:47.540\n If I could magically transport Moscow into my hometown\n\n45:47.540 --> 45:50.100\n and just go out and visit them, yeah.\n\n45:50.100 --> 45:53.180\n So it's very difficult when you're traveling.\n\n45:53.180 --> 45:55.780\n You have to figure out what you're eating,\n\n45:55.780 --> 45:58.500\n how are you getting the food, all the socializing.\n\n45:58.500 --> 46:00.980\n Plus, you're more and more a celebrity,\n\n46:00.980 --> 46:02.980\n so there's a social interaction, which\n\n46:02.980 --> 46:05.500\n I don't know how draining that could be on you\n\n46:05.500 --> 46:07.580\n outside of the arm wrestling table.\n\n46:07.580 --> 46:09.540\n So you have to manage all of that,\n\n46:09.540 --> 46:13.940\n because ultimately, you have to focus on the fight ahead.\n\n46:13.940 --> 46:14.820\n Yeah.\n\n46:14.820 --> 46:18.340\n Yeah, a lot of my strength comes from just\n\n46:18.340 --> 46:22.300\n being in a familiar place, doing my routine.\n\n46:22.300 --> 46:23.740\n I love to travel.\n\n46:23.740 --> 46:29.100\n I love to get out there and meet people and new experiences.\n\n46:29.100 --> 46:32.340\n But when I just want to really prepare for a big match,\n\n46:32.340 --> 46:35.580\n yeah, home is where I get strong.\n\n46:35.580 --> 46:38.140\n So that loss against Dennis was one\n\n46:38.140 --> 46:40.820\n of the few losses in your career.\n\n46:40.820 --> 46:46.060\n How did that feel in the moments after, in the days after,\n\n46:46.060 --> 46:48.460\n in the months after, in the years after?\n\n46:48.460 --> 46:53.260\n How has it changed you as an arm wrestler as a human being?\n\n46:53.260 --> 46:58.380\n Well, it's tough to lose.\n\n46:58.380 --> 46:59.100\n Still haunt you?\n\n47:01.860 --> 47:02.620\n I don't think so.\n\n47:02.620 --> 47:05.220\n I actually was really happy to lose to Dennis,\n\n47:05.220 --> 47:08.460\n because sometimes when you lose a match,\n\n47:08.460 --> 47:11.900\n there's a lot of matches that I've lost where they upset me,\n\n47:11.900 --> 47:13.940\n because I know I made a mistake.\n\n47:13.940 --> 47:15.360\n I didn't make a mistake with Dennis.\n\n47:15.360 --> 47:17.300\n He was just way better.\n\n47:17.300 --> 47:19.780\n There's nothing I could have done that day.\n\n47:19.780 --> 47:22.820\n I'm really at peace with it.\n\n47:22.820 --> 47:25.300\n Dennis, to me, was just a big inspiration.\n\n47:25.300 --> 47:28.260\n I think that me arm wrestling Dennis left handed that day\n\n47:28.260 --> 47:31.620\n just let me touch probably one of the strongest\n\n47:31.620 --> 47:33.220\n human beings on the arm wrestling table\n\n47:33.220 --> 47:36.820\n that's ever lived, left handed.\n\n47:36.820 --> 47:41.980\n So knowing that's possible is almost like inspiration to you\n\n47:41.980 --> 47:43.420\n that I can be at that level, too.\n\n47:43.420 --> 47:45.340\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n47:45.340 --> 47:48.460\n Seeing what Dennis did, just trying\n\n47:48.460 --> 47:54.740\n to absorb a little bit of his knowledge planted seeds in me.\n\n47:54.740 --> 47:59.020\n When I look at my career, it's a bit like the stock market.\n\n47:59.020 --> 48:02.080\n But for sure, I'm trending upwards.\n\n48:02.080 --> 48:05.980\n And since really kind of wrapping my mind\n\n48:05.980 --> 48:09.220\n around some of the Russian philosophies,\n\n48:09.220 --> 48:12.180\n they really changed my training systems.\n\n48:12.180 --> 48:14.380\n There were some base philosophies\n\n48:14.380 --> 48:16.540\n that they talked to me about over there\n\n48:16.540 --> 48:19.660\n that massively impacted my training.\n\n48:19.660 --> 48:21.940\n Is it possible to convert some of those philosophies\n\n48:21.940 --> 48:22.620\n into words?\n\n48:22.620 --> 48:25.860\n Can you describe some of the ideas they taught you?\n\n48:25.860 --> 48:27.940\n Never smile.\n\n48:27.940 --> 48:29.340\n Right?\n\n48:29.340 --> 48:32.380\n Man, it takes a while to break the ice\n\n48:32.380 --> 48:34.620\n with a lot of these guys.\n\n48:34.620 --> 48:37.780\n Well, once you do, that's the deepest bonds you can form.\n\n48:37.780 --> 48:39.680\n Yeah, yeah, for sure.\n\n48:39.680 --> 48:46.020\n I think that I was raised under, I believe it's a flawed.\n\n48:46.020 --> 48:50.700\n I mean, it's not flawed, because it has its value as well.\n\n48:50.700 --> 48:54.940\n But it's best if you understand both philosophies.\n\n48:54.940 --> 48:57.500\n I think a North American thing that's\n\n48:57.500 --> 49:05.340\n just so ingrained in our fitness society is no pain, no gain.\n\n49:05.340 --> 49:09.380\n And just pushing, and sweating, and going harder,\n\n49:09.380 --> 49:14.860\n and fighting through, and grit, and tough.\n\n49:14.860 --> 49:16.220\n And then you talk to the Russians,\n\n49:16.220 --> 49:18.220\n and they're like, yeah, never fail.\n\n49:18.220 --> 49:19.380\n You never fail.\n\n49:19.380 --> 49:21.480\n Never go to failure.\n\n49:21.480 --> 49:23.140\n Always feel good.\n\n49:23.140 --> 49:23.940\n Always feel good.\n\n49:23.940 --> 49:26.660\n It should always feel good.\n\n49:26.660 --> 49:29.560\n And those two philosophies express themselves\n\n49:29.560 --> 49:31.980\n very differently.\n\n49:31.980 --> 49:36.340\n And if you want to get strong, yeah, don't fail.\n\n49:36.340 --> 49:37.540\n Don't fail.\n\n49:37.540 --> 49:41.660\n So they also are believers of volume.\n\n49:41.660 --> 49:44.900\n Yeah, there's a lot of strategies,\n\n49:44.900 --> 49:47.380\n but volume is a massive principle.\n\n49:47.380 --> 49:50.580\n And volume is very hard to achieve\n\n49:50.580 --> 49:53.780\n when you're believing in no pain, no gain.\n\n49:53.780 --> 49:55.380\n They don't really go together.\n\n49:55.380 --> 49:58.840\n No pain, no gain, more injuries.\n\n49:58.840 --> 50:00.340\n So is there parallels?\n\n50:00.340 --> 50:03.060\n Because in wrestling, some of the greatest wrestlers\n\n50:03.060 --> 50:04.540\n of all time are Russian.\n\n50:04.540 --> 50:07.460\n And they were big, Dan Gable talks about it,\n\n50:07.460 --> 50:10.060\n they were big on play.\n\n50:10.060 --> 50:12.780\n Like, lighter wrestling is probably,\n\n50:12.780 --> 50:15.500\n ultimately, actually, it boils down to\n\n50:15.500 --> 50:17.900\n that's how you achieve higher volume.\n\n50:17.900 --> 50:20.240\n Like, over the stretch of years,\n\n50:20.240 --> 50:22.240\n the way to reduce injury.\n\n50:24.020 --> 50:26.460\n I mean, in wrestling also, technique\n\n50:27.620 --> 50:32.200\n might have greater value than it does in arm wrestling.\n\n50:32.200 --> 50:33.860\n Obviously, technique is extremely important\n\n50:33.860 --> 50:34.740\n in arm wrestling.\n\n50:34.740 --> 50:39.740\n But power can defeat technique, it seems like.\n\n50:40.420 --> 50:42.560\n In wrestling, you can get away.\n\n50:42.560 --> 50:46.620\n There's a lot of ways you can really do sneak attacks,\n\n50:46.620 --> 50:49.000\n sort of use leverage on those kinds of things.\n\n50:49.000 --> 50:51.860\n So there's even more incentive to do play\n\n50:51.860 --> 50:53.420\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n50:53.420 --> 50:57.060\n But do you see the parallels between the two worlds,\n\n50:57.060 --> 50:58.100\n wrestling and arm wrestling?\n\n50:58.100 --> 50:59.000\n 100%.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:01.500\n Well, you saw what I did the other night, right?\n\n51:01.500 --> 51:04.220\n So I'm playing on the table for hours, right?\n\n51:04.220 --> 51:09.180\n So that's my number one training thing that I do,\n\n51:09.180 --> 51:13.060\n is I go on the table for hours and I play.\n\n51:13.060 --> 51:14.020\n Yeah.\n\n51:14.020 --> 51:16.800\n Yeah, when you did, Sergey, can you pull up that video?\n\n51:16.800 --> 51:20.340\n It's on Devin's channel, the water tank one.\n\n51:20.340 --> 51:22.140\n Oh, it's like 180p.\n\n51:22.140 --> 51:25.220\n It's like, the wifi in there was so bad.\n\n51:25.220 --> 51:26.060\n Yeah.\n\n51:26.060 --> 51:26.900\n It's great, I love it.\n\n51:26.900 --> 51:29.740\n It's, maybe, I don't know if it was fish eye,\n\n51:29.740 --> 51:32.300\n but it had a fish eye feel, it was crowded.\n\n51:32.300 --> 51:34.900\n I mean, so much camaraderie, it was amazing.\n\n51:34.900 --> 51:39.260\n But maybe just a brief mention of Dimitri,\n\n51:39.260 --> 51:42.300\n the Russian guy.\n\n51:42.300 --> 51:47.300\n What, in that play, what are some memorable things here?\n\n51:48.900 --> 51:51.260\n Like, when you go against a bunch of different people,\n\n51:51.260 --> 51:54.020\n a bunch of strangers, what are all the differences\n\n51:54.020 --> 51:56.460\n and how do you grow from them, how do you learn from them?\n\n51:56.460 --> 51:58.000\n Well, everybody's a bit different.\n\n51:58.000 --> 52:02.140\n So, I love to go to new clubs,\n\n52:02.140 --> 52:04.260\n because the energy's always high.\n\n52:04.260 --> 52:06.100\n Like, the first time you go to a club,\n\n52:06.100 --> 52:07.480\n everybody's trying to kill you.\n\n52:07.480 --> 52:08.320\n Yeah.\n\n52:08.320 --> 52:09.140\n Yeah, so they're gonna.\n\n52:09.140 --> 52:09.980\n There's excitement and there's this,\n\n52:09.980 --> 52:11.060\n and so you feed off of that.\n\n52:11.060 --> 52:14.420\n Yeah, you do, you can, if you're able to be strong enough\n\n52:14.420 --> 52:17.780\n to absorb it without injury, it's awesome, it's awesome.\n\n52:19.060 --> 52:20.460\n Because they're giving you everything they can.\n\n52:20.460 --> 52:23.460\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n52:23.460 --> 52:26.040\n Right, so it's very specific, right?\n\n52:26.040 --> 52:28.100\n Like, I'm gonna get way stronger at arm wrestling.\n\n52:28.100 --> 52:31.360\n And what I try and do, when I go to these places,\n\n52:31.360 --> 52:34.300\n is I make an assumption, I make an assumption\n\n52:34.300 --> 52:36.140\n that I'm the best guy there.\n\n52:36.140 --> 52:41.140\n And so, I'll arm wrestle in a way that kind of protects them,\n\n52:41.420 --> 52:43.400\n because the more I can protect them\n\n52:43.400 --> 52:47.340\n and kind of keep them kind of in a good position,\n\n52:47.340 --> 52:49.700\n they can actually give me more, right?\n\n52:49.700 --> 52:52.760\n So, I kind of give them little pieces\n\n52:52.760 --> 52:55.500\n that I think will put them in a place\n\n52:55.500 --> 52:58.300\n that they can really give me more.\n\n52:58.300 --> 53:00.420\n And so, yeah, that's what I'm doing.\n\n53:00.420 --> 53:03.660\n And then, when I see somebody like Dimitri,\n\n53:03.660 --> 53:06.180\n I pull that in a little bit, right?\n\n53:06.180 --> 53:09.640\n So, okay, so I know Dimitri's the number one guy in Texas.\n\n53:10.800 --> 53:12.340\n Lots of respect to the guy.\n\n53:12.340 --> 53:15.020\n I won't give him all the pieces\n\n53:15.020 --> 53:17.780\n until I really kind of gauge where he's at,\n\n53:17.780 --> 53:21.420\n because I certainly, in training, don't wanna fail.\n\n53:21.420 --> 53:24.020\n I don't want that, I don't want to.\n\n53:24.020 --> 53:26.420\n When you fail in arm wrestling,\n\n53:26.420 --> 53:28.500\n imagine it's just bad technique.\n\n53:28.500 --> 53:30.060\n And you're trying, and bad technique,\n\n53:30.060 --> 53:31.900\n you're gonna get hurt, yeah.\n\n53:31.900 --> 53:34.020\n So, you always want to be in a strong position here.\n\n53:34.020 --> 53:37.060\n What about, how does endurance come into play here?\n\n53:37.060 --> 53:39.980\n And here's video of you strapping up with Dimitri.\n\n53:39.980 --> 53:43.120\n How do you, I mean, you went for like, I don't know,\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:43.960\n two hours?\n\n53:43.960 --> 53:44.900\n Yeah, it was long.\n\n53:44.900 --> 53:47.640\n So, this first run of the video, I think,\n\n53:47.640 --> 53:50.300\n was a little over an hour, and then I took a break,\n\n53:50.300 --> 53:53.380\n and I probably did another 45 minutes or so, but.\n\n53:53.380 --> 53:57.580\n I mean, do you, how can, are you okay\n\n53:57.580 --> 53:58.900\n with the endurance aspect of this?\n\n53:58.900 --> 54:00.820\n Yeah, that's probably, like, when you talk\n\n54:00.820 --> 54:02.260\n to the arm wrestling world, that's probably\n\n54:02.260 --> 54:05.020\n what I'm best known for, is my endurance.\n\n54:05.020 --> 54:07.120\n So, this helps build that.\n\n54:07.120 --> 54:08.860\n It does, but that's not why I'm doing it.\n\n54:08.860 --> 54:11.060\n I'm doing it to get strong.\n\n54:11.060 --> 54:14.780\n In my opinion, this is one of the best ways to get strong,\n\n54:14.780 --> 54:17.980\n especially far away from a tournament,\n\n54:17.980 --> 54:19.380\n or any kind of an event.\n\n54:21.780 --> 54:25.300\n I wouldn't wanna do this, you know, even a month,\n\n54:25.300 --> 54:28.440\n or even six weeks, or even, maybe even eight weeks\n\n54:28.440 --> 54:29.760\n before a big event.\n\n54:29.760 --> 54:33.300\n I'd want to already be kind of shrinking my volume,\n\n54:33.300 --> 54:36.600\n but far away from an event, yeah, as much volume\n\n54:36.600 --> 54:38.540\n as your body can handle, and you'll feel it.\n\n54:38.540 --> 54:39.360\n You'll feel it.\n\n54:39.360 --> 54:41.580\n Like, I felt it at times, like, you know,\n\n54:41.580 --> 54:43.100\n after the hour mark, I'm like, okay,\n\n54:43.100 --> 54:45.600\n I can feel my blood sugar kind of diminishing.\n\n54:45.600 --> 54:48.700\n I can feel, like, the blood that's going to my muscles\n\n54:48.700 --> 54:53.340\n is kinda like, it's not really pushing more good stuff in.\n\n54:53.340 --> 54:56.440\n It's, I'm starting to break down, and you don't want that.\n\n54:56.440 --> 54:57.960\n You don't want that.\n\n54:57.960 --> 54:58.800\n Quick pause.\n\n54:58.800 --> 54:59.900\n Bathroom break?\n\n54:59.900 --> 55:00.900\n I'm good, I'm good.\n\n55:00.900 --> 55:02.580\n I kinda need one.\n\n55:02.580 --> 55:04.380\n I'll maybe get a sweater, it's a bit.\n\n55:04.380 --> 55:05.380\n Is it cold?\n\n55:05.380 --> 55:06.200\n Does that matter?\n\n55:06.200 --> 55:07.900\n Does that care for kind of continuity?\n\n55:07.900 --> 55:08.720\n No, no, no, no.\n\n55:08.720 --> 55:09.560\n I can make it warmer.\n\n55:09.560 --> 55:10.400\n No, no, no, I'll just put a sweater on,\n\n55:10.400 --> 55:12.180\n it's fine, but that doesn't matter.\n\n55:12.180 --> 55:14.400\n And I still love the idea of you going to Russia.\n\n55:14.400 --> 55:15.240\n Yeah.\n\n55:15.240 --> 55:16.340\n And training there.\n\n55:16.340 --> 55:17.180\n Yeah.\n\n55:17.180 --> 55:18.880\n I'm also making a trip out to Russia.\n\n55:18.880 --> 55:19.720\n Oh yeah, when?\n\n55:19.720 --> 55:20.560\n For different reasons.\n\n55:20.560 --> 55:23.260\n Well, it's hard with the current conflict,\n\n55:23.260 --> 55:26.180\n the tensions there, but I'm hoping before your match,\n\n55:26.180 --> 55:29.220\n actually, so May, for a couple of interviews\n\n55:29.220 --> 55:32.800\n with a couple of folks, some of which people know.\n\n55:34.380 --> 55:36.000\n Maybe I could ask you about,\n\n55:37.640 --> 55:40.020\n to comment on some matches that stand out to you\n\n55:40.020 --> 55:42.860\n in your career.\n\n55:42.860 --> 55:43.700\n Sure.\n\n55:45.540 --> 55:48.380\n Is there something, is there a particular,\n\n55:48.380 --> 55:50.060\n I have a bunch that I really enjoy,\n\n55:50.060 --> 55:54.260\n but is there something that stands out to you as memorable?\n\n55:54.260 --> 55:58.860\n We talked about sort of a defining loss, perhaps,\n\n55:58.860 --> 55:59.700\n to Dennis.\n\n56:00.660 --> 56:04.900\n Then you faced Michael Todd, like you mentioned,\n\n56:04.900 --> 56:08.700\n John Brzenk, you faced Matt.\n\n56:09.880 --> 56:11.720\n Is there something that stands out to you\n\n56:11.720 --> 56:14.620\n that technically or psychologically\n\n56:14.620 --> 56:16.660\n you've learned a lot from?\n\n56:17.940 --> 56:20.320\n I feel like I try and learn something from every match,\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:22.660\n but there is a very special match to me\n\n56:22.660 --> 56:25.040\n that to this day, I can't explain.\n\n56:27.900 --> 56:30.340\n Very weird phenomenon.\n\n56:30.340 --> 56:35.340\n So, I think it was 2005 was my first combat tour overseas.\n\n56:38.760 --> 56:42.600\n So, it was a active tour.\n\n56:44.660 --> 56:48.060\n Among other things, I got shot during that tour,\n\n56:48.060 --> 56:51.060\n we got blown, long tour, rough tour.\n\n56:51.060 --> 56:53.580\n And I trained the whole time through\n\n56:53.580 --> 56:55.220\n knowing that at the end of this,\n\n56:55.220 --> 56:56.980\n I was gonna have a big match.\n\n56:56.980 --> 57:01.300\n So, there's a champion, a guy called Ron Bath.\n\n57:02.200 --> 57:05.080\n He's kind of, if there was no John Brzenk,\n\n57:05.080 --> 57:06.700\n there would be Ron Bath.\n\n57:06.700 --> 57:10.220\n Okay, so, extremely decorated,\n\n57:10.220 --> 57:13.240\n unbelievable arm wrestler from the United States.\n\n57:13.240 --> 57:15.340\n And this is kind of when I was just\n\n57:15.340 --> 57:17.620\n kind of coming up in the sport still.\n\n57:17.620 --> 57:18.980\n I was fairly well established,\n\n57:18.980 --> 57:21.060\n I was definitely the best guy in Canada.\n\n57:21.060 --> 57:23.060\n And I had been for a few years,\n\n57:23.060 --> 57:26.840\n but I hadn't really expanded internationally too much.\n\n57:27.700 --> 57:32.460\n So, I had a one on one match with Ron Bath\n\n57:32.460 --> 57:35.340\n and that's the one.\n\n57:35.340 --> 57:39.420\n Yeah, extremely hard fought battle.\n\n57:39.420 --> 57:41.640\n Was three one, I think, three one,\n\n57:41.640 --> 57:44.020\n but every match was really close\n\n57:44.020 --> 57:45.980\n and he won the first one.\n\n57:45.980 --> 57:49.180\n And I had to kind of dig my way out of the trenches\n\n57:49.180 --> 57:51.460\n and ended up coming back and winning.\n\n57:51.460 --> 57:55.300\n But it was a match that was probably,\n\n57:55.300 --> 57:58.300\n it was probably one of my closest matches ever.\n\n57:58.300 --> 58:00.780\n And it was.\n\n58:00.780 --> 58:02.380\n It seems like there's frustration on you.\n\n58:02.380 --> 58:03.220\n What is that?\n\n58:03.220 --> 58:06.740\n What was going through your mind here with these?\n\n58:06.740 --> 58:08.000\n Was it, first of all, going in,\n\n58:08.000 --> 58:09.900\n did you think you could beat him?\n\n58:09.900 --> 58:10.740\n What was the level of confidence?\n\n58:10.740 --> 58:13.500\n I always think I can win, like I always do.\n\n58:13.500 --> 58:16.860\n But, you know, a lot of respect to the guy.\n\n58:17.940 --> 58:20.140\n But yeah, I mean, I always think I can do it.\n\n58:21.340 --> 58:24.660\n So how did, what lessons did you take away from it?\n\n58:24.660 --> 58:26.400\n Why is it so meaningful to you?\n\n58:27.500 --> 58:29.580\n Well, it's what happened afterwards.\n\n58:29.580 --> 58:32.900\n So, I had some kind of a release afterwards.\n\n58:33.980 --> 58:36.300\n And that was the strange thing to me.\n\n58:36.300 --> 58:41.300\n So, match ended and I felt like,\n\n58:41.300 --> 58:46.300\n so relaxed afterwards, so calm, so, so, you know, satisfied.\n\n58:47.620 --> 58:49.780\n Because it was one of those matches\n\n58:49.780 --> 58:52.660\n that kind of takes everything from you, but you win it.\n\n58:53.860 --> 58:56.860\n And I was relaxing in the chair\n\n58:57.820 --> 59:01.500\n and I've never had this sensation before.\n\n59:01.500 --> 59:03.380\n I've never had it afterwards,\n\n59:03.380 --> 59:07.740\n but it's like the center of my backbone just exploded.\n\n59:07.740 --> 59:11.700\n And it was like, it's so weird, right?\n\n59:11.700 --> 59:14.860\n Cause I'm not really spiritual that much or religious even,\n\n59:14.860 --> 59:17.860\n but it's like a fire just ripped through me\n\n59:17.860 --> 59:19.700\n and it only lasted an instant.\n\n59:19.700 --> 59:22.140\n Just exploded through my whole body,\n\n59:22.140 --> 59:25.780\n out the top, through my feet.\n\n59:25.780 --> 59:27.780\n And then it was gone, that was it.\n\n59:27.780 --> 59:30.620\n Weirdest thing I've ever felt in my entire life.\n\n59:32.060 --> 59:35.100\n Yeah, but it was as a result of,\n\n59:35.100 --> 59:39.780\n yeah, but it was as a result of what happened in the match\n\n59:39.780 --> 59:42.700\n and leading up to it, I had some kind of a release.\n\n59:44.100 --> 59:46.820\n To what it does, it almost,\n\n59:46.820 --> 59:48.340\n how did you interpret it psychologically?\n\n59:48.340 --> 59:52.060\n Was it like some kind of, I mean,\n\n59:52.060 --> 59:53.620\n not to be spiritual or whatever,\n\n59:53.620 --> 59:57.580\n but some kind of superpower that was like,\n\n59:58.460 --> 1:00:03.460\n like a lingering feeling like, holy shit, I, you know.\n\n1:00:03.460 --> 1:00:05.540\n I can't, I can't explain it.\n\n1:00:05.540 --> 1:00:09.340\n And I haven't really tried hard enough to try to.\n\n1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:10.660\n But something changed.\n\n1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:12.540\n Something happened there, yeah.\n\n1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:13.460\n Something happened to me.\n\n1:00:13.460 --> 1:00:15.820\n I was sore for about three or four months afterwards.\n\n1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:18.580\n It's like it smoked out my entire body.\n\n1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:21.420\n Yeah, that whole summer I was kind of sore.\n\n1:00:21.420 --> 1:00:23.660\n And yeah, and then after that,\n\n1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:25.140\n like two or three years later,\n\n1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:27.300\n that's when I won the world championships.\n\n1:00:29.020 --> 1:00:30.860\n Yeah, I mean, all the matches are,\n\n1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:33.660\n you know, you get something from people, like, you know,\n\n1:00:33.660 --> 1:00:37.380\n you study them, you take something from them.\n\n1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:42.060\n People have an invisible crown and he had one.\n\n1:00:42.060 --> 1:00:43.620\n And I think I took it from him.\n\n1:00:43.620 --> 1:00:44.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:44.460 --> 1:00:45.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:48.300\n Maybe that was the feeling of wearing the crown.\n\n1:00:48.300 --> 1:00:49.140\n Yeah, maybe.\n\n1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:51.540\n What about all the trash talk?\n\n1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.020\n How much of that did you learn?\n\n1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:54.300\n Does that come naturally to you?\n\n1:00:54.300 --> 1:00:56.420\n You're one of the most charismatic, fun.\n\n1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:59.460\n I mean, there's always like respect behind it.\n\n1:00:59.460 --> 1:01:02.580\n I would say to me, and I'm a fan of a lot of sports,\n\n1:01:02.580 --> 1:01:06.300\n you're one of the greatest trash talkers in all of sports\n\n1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:09.620\n that I've ever seen because you're able to talk shit,\n\n1:01:10.620 --> 1:01:13.180\n but there's so much love and respect behind it.\n\n1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:14.340\n It's just masterful.\n\n1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:17.260\n But you also get into people's heads in the moment.\n\n1:01:17.260 --> 1:01:18.380\n It's beautiful to watch\n\n1:01:18.380 --> 1:01:21.660\n because it really gets to some people.\n\n1:01:21.660 --> 1:01:22.860\n So where does that come from?\n\n1:01:22.860 --> 1:01:24.580\n It's a powerful weapon, right?\n\n1:01:24.580 --> 1:01:25.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:25.420 --> 1:01:28.260\n Your voice is a powerful, powerful weapon.\n\n1:01:28.260 --> 1:01:31.420\n And it's underutilized by so many athletes\n\n1:01:31.420 --> 1:01:34.860\n because they think that it's not sportsmanlike\n\n1:01:34.860 --> 1:01:37.180\n or something like that.\n\n1:01:37.180 --> 1:01:42.180\n But the truth is, I mean, you can be a weak person,\n\n1:01:43.900 --> 1:01:46.620\n but with your voice, you can influence\n\n1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:48.820\n and change any number of things.\n\n1:01:48.820 --> 1:01:52.340\n And the same thing happens in a fight between two people.\n\n1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:55.860\n If you can just be a never ending, you know,\n\n1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:59.940\n flow of negative encouragement to someone\n\n1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:04.940\n or, you know, suggestion, anything can happen.\n\n1:02:05.740 --> 1:02:06.900\n It's a tool.\n\n1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.260\n And when you're fighting a person,\n\n1:02:11.260 --> 1:02:13.340\n you're not just fighting them.\n\n1:02:13.340 --> 1:02:15.820\n You're fighting everyone who's watching.\n\n1:02:15.820 --> 1:02:19.220\n You're fighting the crowd, the referees.\n\n1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:24.220\n And, you know, to get in the most ideal positions,\n\n1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:27.540\n situations, you need to use your voice, yeah.\n\n1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:30.500\n Yeah, and there's, for people who haven't seen,\n\n1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:32.020\n I definitely recommend you watch\n\n1:02:32.020 --> 1:02:33.300\n a bunch of arm wrestling matches\n\n1:02:33.300 --> 1:02:36.020\n because there's a crowd really gets into it.\n\n1:02:36.020 --> 1:02:38.940\n And it feels like there's a really intimate connection\n\n1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:39.860\n with the crowd.\n\n1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:41.340\n I suppose because the crowd is allowed\n\n1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:42.180\n to be very close to you.\n\n1:02:42.180 --> 1:02:43.980\n Yeah, I love it.\n\n1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:47.500\n I want the crowd like right up on me.\n\n1:02:47.500 --> 1:02:48.700\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:02:48.700 --> 1:02:52.820\n So sometimes, oh yeah.\n\n1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:56.420\n So who are you, whenever you talk to somebody,\n\n1:02:56.420 --> 1:02:58.220\n you literally pick somebody from the crowd?\n\n1:02:58.220 --> 1:02:59.060\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:02:59.060 --> 1:03:02.420\n Oh yeah, I'll fucking, like I'll start fucking off\n\n1:03:02.420 --> 1:03:06.540\n his fans and like, yeah, like I'll start talking\n\n1:03:06.540 --> 1:03:08.340\n to their wives or whatever.\n\n1:03:08.340 --> 1:03:11.700\n Yeah, yeah, there's Jody.\n\n1:03:12.860 --> 1:03:16.100\n She's pretty dangerous to listen to also.\n\n1:03:16.100 --> 1:03:18.300\n But yeah, one of his buddies, Mike Solares,\n\n1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:21.540\n who's, you know, really good arm wrestler,\n\n1:03:21.540 --> 1:03:25.300\n was cheering for him, so I started to go after him.\n\n1:03:25.300 --> 1:03:26.700\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:03:26.700 --> 1:03:27.740\n Smiling the whole time.\n\n1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:29.060\n Yeah, it's fun, right?\n\n1:03:29.060 --> 1:03:29.900\n It's fun.\n\n1:03:29.900 --> 1:03:31.740\n It's a fan, it's fun to listen to,\n\n1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:35.300\n but it's also, what's fun is how much it actually affects\n\n1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:36.620\n some of the people you're facing.\n\n1:03:36.620 --> 1:03:37.700\n They get frustrated.\n\n1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:38.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:38.540 --> 1:03:39.380\n It's great to see.\n\n1:03:39.380 --> 1:03:40.860\n Well, you have to fight, right?\n\n1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:43.940\n Like a lot of people think things will be given to them.\n\n1:03:43.940 --> 1:03:47.100\n And the thing that, you know, I've always believed\n\n1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:48.460\n from the time I was very young,\n\n1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:53.460\n like I was convinced that our inevitable death\n\n1:03:54.820 --> 1:03:57.100\n was gonna come from aliens, right?\n\n1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:01.300\n Like some super aggressive, super violent species\n\n1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:03.740\n was gonna come and smoke us all, you know?\n\n1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:06.620\n And I'm like, I'm not like that.\n\n1:04:06.620 --> 1:04:09.140\n I'm like, but as soon as one person is,\n\n1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:12.900\n then you're forced to have to accept it as reality, right?\n\n1:04:12.900 --> 1:04:17.900\n So I like to fight for every single thing.\n\n1:04:17.900 --> 1:04:20.500\n I like to try and be more and more aggressive.\n\n1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.380\n And if someone matches me,\n\n1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:24.140\n that's when I can use my endurance.\n\n1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:27.580\n And if they don't, then I have the tactical advantage.\n\n1:04:27.580 --> 1:04:29.300\n So that's kind of my balance point.\n\n1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:31.820\n And then, by the way, you also yell at the ref.\n\n1:04:31.820 --> 1:04:32.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:32.660 --> 1:04:35.540\n I mean, the games, there's like levels to this game,\n\n1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:37.580\n but you know, the feeling sometimes\n\n1:04:37.580 --> 1:04:38.820\n when people get frustrated is like,\n\n1:04:38.820 --> 1:04:40.500\n okay, this person's cheating,\n\n1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.580\n or like you're trying to get a good grip\n\n1:04:43.580 --> 1:04:47.460\n before it goes.\n\n1:04:47.460 --> 1:04:50.140\n And I think some of the frustration\n\n1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:52.260\n in combination with the trash talk is,\n\n1:04:52.260 --> 1:04:54.020\n well, this person is cheating,\n\n1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.580\n but everybody is like kind of trying to cheat,\n\n1:04:56.580 --> 1:04:58.820\n get an edge within the rules.\n\n1:04:58.820 --> 1:04:59.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:59.740 --> 1:05:02.980\n So I try and just ramp it, ramp it, ramp it.\n\n1:05:04.460 --> 1:05:06.740\n But you know, everybody's different.\n\n1:05:06.740 --> 1:05:08.860\n I've learned how to play the game\n\n1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:11.300\n based off of the tools that I have physically.\n\n1:05:11.300 --> 1:05:14.740\n And for me, this works because, you know,\n\n1:05:14.740 --> 1:05:19.460\n my genetic makeup is more of a persistence hunter, right?\n\n1:05:19.460 --> 1:05:21.540\n So like, I need to extend things,\n\n1:05:21.540 --> 1:05:23.980\n and that works well for me.\n\n1:05:25.660 --> 1:05:28.980\n You know, if I was more explosive,\n\n1:05:28.980 --> 1:05:31.540\n I probably wouldn't have the same strategies.\n\n1:05:31.540 --> 1:05:32.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.300\n By the way, for people who are watching,\n\n1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:37.740\n you're wearing a No Limits hoodie,\n\n1:05:37.740 --> 1:05:40.260\n which is one of your nicknames.\n\n1:05:40.260 --> 1:05:42.380\n I don't wash this thing too much.\n\n1:05:42.380 --> 1:05:45.460\n It's my bacterial shield to the world.\n\n1:05:45.460 --> 1:05:46.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:47.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:47.540 --> 1:05:48.380\n Awesome.\n\n1:05:48.380 --> 1:05:49.220\n So you mentioned Jody.\n\n1:05:49.220 --> 1:05:51.180\n She's often in your corner\n\n1:05:51.180 --> 1:05:54.820\n and does perhaps more trash talking than even you.\n\n1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:58.460\n So I mean, if we could step away,\n\n1:05:58.460 --> 1:06:00.060\n she's an incredible human being.\n\n1:06:00.060 --> 1:06:04.140\n As sort of as a fan, it's fun to watch the two of you,\n\n1:06:04.140 --> 1:06:07.380\n both when you're arm wrestling and just as people.\n\n1:06:07.380 --> 1:06:11.660\n I just see so much, I don't know,\n\n1:06:11.660 --> 1:06:14.860\n kindness and love radiating from the two of you\n\n1:06:14.860 --> 1:06:17.100\n whenever you're trash talking\n\n1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:19.540\n or talking about just random things\n\n1:06:19.540 --> 1:06:20.620\n or just talking about life.\n\n1:06:20.620 --> 1:06:22.020\n It's just a beautiful thing to watch.\n\n1:06:22.020 --> 1:06:23.460\n And thank you for sharing that with the world.\n\n1:06:23.460 --> 1:06:28.460\n But maybe can you, she paid me to ask you this,\n\n1:06:28.780 --> 1:06:32.220\n but what are the things you love about Jody,\n\n1:06:32.220 --> 1:06:33.500\n your wife, Jody Laird?\n\n1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:37.580\n What are the ways she's affected your life?\n\n1:06:38.540 --> 1:06:39.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:42.660\n Jody and I go way back, right?\n\n1:06:42.660 --> 1:06:44.220\n We were in high school together.\n\n1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:51.700\n The thing that I admire most in people is bravery.\n\n1:06:53.900 --> 1:06:56.780\n To me, it's the most admirable quality.\n\n1:06:57.780 --> 1:07:02.780\n And Jody always has inspired me\n\n1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:04.780\n because she's such a fighter.\n\n1:07:04.780 --> 1:07:07.780\n If she believes that something's true,\n\n1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:10.780\n she does not back down.\n\n1:07:10.780 --> 1:07:11.860\n She will not.\n\n1:07:11.860 --> 1:07:14.980\n And not to say that she can't change her mind\n\n1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:19.300\n because she can, but while she is convicted,\n\n1:07:19.300 --> 1:07:21.300\n she will not stop fighting.\n\n1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:25.340\n She's pulled me out of the fire repeatedly.\n\n1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:28.540\n We've lived through so many things.\n\n1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:29.580\n Very lucky.\n\n1:07:29.580 --> 1:07:32.180\n How has she made you a better arm wrestler?\n\n1:07:32.180 --> 1:07:33.100\n She's fed me.\n\n1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:38.260\n Yeah, I could see your videos of your house\n\n1:07:38.260 --> 1:07:40.460\n basically coming apart when she's not there.\n\n1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:41.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:46.740\n Yeah, without Jody, I'm on the street living in a tent\n\n1:07:46.740 --> 1:07:50.060\n and yeah, eating dog food.\n\n1:07:50.060 --> 1:07:50.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:54.460\n Bravery.\n\n1:07:54.460 --> 1:07:55.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:56.140\n What about love?\n\n1:07:56.140 --> 1:07:57.620\n How has love made you stronger?\n\n1:07:57.620 --> 1:08:00.100\n Now we're gonna make Devin uncomfortable.\n\n1:08:00.100 --> 1:08:03.220\n Yeah, love is difficult to accept.\n\n1:08:04.300 --> 1:08:06.460\n Love is one of those things that,\n\n1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:11.540\n a lot of times, you don't feel worthy of it.\n\n1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:15.900\n And so it's hard sometimes to accept someone's love.\n\n1:08:15.900 --> 1:08:18.940\n And someone who really loves you,\n\n1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:20.900\n they'll love you even when you don't.\n\n1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:25.060\n And here you go, you're gonna make me cry, Alex.\n\n1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:29.020\n Yeah, Jody and I have been through so much.\n\n1:08:29.020 --> 1:08:34.020\n And she's shown me how she supported me\n\n1:08:35.500 --> 1:08:37.660\n just repeatedly, repeatedly.\n\n1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:40.660\n Some of that is loyalty and patience and perseverance\n\n1:08:40.660 --> 1:08:41.860\n and all those things.\n\n1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:46.220\n That's like when love really shows itself.\n\n1:08:46.220 --> 1:08:47.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:47.060 --> 1:08:49.420\n It's like sticking through together for years\n\n1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:52.660\n even when you're through the shitty times.\n\n1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:57.060\n Love and faith are powerful forces in this universe.\n\n1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:02.020\n Without them, we can descend into darkness very quickly.\n\n1:09:02.020 --> 1:09:04.660\n As a world, even between people.\n\n1:09:04.660 --> 1:09:09.660\n When love and faith is destroyed, then we fall apart.\n\n1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:16.020\n And I've been graced by the love that Jody's given me.\n\n1:09:16.460 --> 1:09:19.860\n It's allowed me to continue to build.\n\n1:09:19.860 --> 1:09:22.700\n When you have love between people, then you build together.\n\n1:09:23.820 --> 1:09:27.780\n I love my family, I love Canada,\n\n1:09:27.780 --> 1:09:29.380\n I love the arm wrestling community.\n\n1:09:29.380 --> 1:09:31.580\n I have a love for what we're trying to achieve\n\n1:09:31.580 --> 1:09:33.700\n as a human species, you know?\n\n1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:38.700\n And when that falls apart, we don't have much.\n\n1:09:38.700 --> 1:09:42.500\n Yeah, just with my boy there, yeah.\n\n1:09:42.500 --> 1:09:43.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:48.340\n You also mentioned you once had a job\n\n1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:54.540\n where your death was a real possibility.\n\n1:09:54.540 --> 1:09:56.980\n So you were in the Canadian Special Forces.\n\n1:09:56.980 --> 1:10:00.540\n What did you take away from that experience,\n\n1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:02.900\n that time in your life?\n\n1:10:02.900 --> 1:10:05.820\n It was such a great life.\n\n1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:07.100\n Really, really loved it.\n\n1:10:07.100 --> 1:10:09.620\n Honestly, I never wanted to leave.\n\n1:10:09.620 --> 1:10:10.820\n I never thought I would leave.\n\n1:10:10.820 --> 1:10:15.220\n I thought I'd be there my whole life.\n\n1:10:15.220 --> 1:10:18.260\n A real honor to get to serve.\n\n1:10:18.260 --> 1:10:19.420\n What did you get to do?\n\n1:10:19.420 --> 1:10:22.380\n What was the things you loved craftsmanship wise,\n\n1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:25.900\n like fun things you get to do, learn and challenge yourself?\n\n1:10:25.900 --> 1:10:30.900\n And you mentioned sort of honor in terms of the serving part.\n\n1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:32.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:33.220 --> 1:10:38.220\n Yeah, my favorite thing about serving in the Special Forces\n\n1:10:38.220 --> 1:10:40.540\n was for sure the people that I worked with.\n\n1:10:40.540 --> 1:10:43.900\n That's probably the first thing I could say, you know,\n\n1:10:43.900 --> 1:10:48.340\n I never, I always felt like totally comfortable\n\n1:10:48.340 --> 1:10:51.500\n and putting my life in the other guy's hands.\n\n1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:56.500\n I was so happy to be in a place where I felt I could follow.\n\n1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:59.580\n Like didn't matter.\n\n1:10:59.580 --> 1:11:03.380\n Like I knew that the people ahead of me were incredible.\n\n1:11:03.380 --> 1:11:05.940\n I knew the people beside me were incredible.\n\n1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:09.900\n So just having that faith in your team, it's very special.\n\n1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:12.580\n And to know that they're there for a reason\n\n1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:15.180\n that has nothing to do with money, you know,\n\n1:11:15.180 --> 1:11:17.740\n and that's what kind of brings everybody together\n\n1:11:17.740 --> 1:11:19.700\n is you're there for a higher purpose.\n\n1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:24.380\n And in terms of being an adrenaline junkie,\n\n1:11:24.380 --> 1:11:25.620\n there's nothing like it.\n\n1:11:25.620 --> 1:11:27.420\n I mean, there's nothing like, you know,\n\n1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:29.820\n going out at night and fighting.\n\n1:11:29.820 --> 1:11:33.860\n And when I say fighting, like my whole life I wanted to fight.\n\n1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:38.860\n And to me, there's a lot of, and look at,\n\n1:11:39.220 --> 1:11:40.740\n I've said this in the past\n\n1:11:40.740 --> 1:11:43.100\n and I think it's been a personal failure of mine\n\n1:11:43.100 --> 1:11:44.740\n because I've said things like,\n\n1:11:44.740 --> 1:11:46.380\n it's the highest level that you can do.\n\n1:11:46.380 --> 1:11:48.220\n And I don't believe that to be true anymore.\n\n1:11:48.220 --> 1:11:52.740\n But at the time, I thought it was the best way\n\n1:11:52.740 --> 1:11:56.580\n I could express my drives that I had, you know,\n\n1:11:56.580 --> 1:11:57.580\n to be a fighter.\n\n1:11:58.780 --> 1:12:02.060\n So your sense in the past and maybe in part now\n\n1:12:02.060 --> 1:12:05.820\n is that sort of fighting is when humans get a chance\n\n1:12:05.820 --> 1:12:10.820\n to express themselves deeply, like that mix of the bravery,\n\n1:12:12.180 --> 1:12:17.180\n the integrity, the, whatever that is that makes us human,\n\n1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:19.420\n that human spirit can really shine.\n\n1:12:19.420 --> 1:12:21.060\n And I don't believe that anymore.\n\n1:12:21.060 --> 1:12:24.220\n I believe that you can do that in any field,\n\n1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:26.860\n in any discipline, you know, if you go hard enough,\n\n1:12:26.860 --> 1:12:28.980\n it all kind of starts to feel the same.\n\n1:12:28.980 --> 1:12:31.740\n But at the time, that, you know,\n\n1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:34.380\n expression to me was really, really awesome.\n\n1:12:34.380 --> 1:12:36.580\n I loved close quarter battle.\n\n1:12:36.580 --> 1:12:37.900\n That was my favorite thing.\n\n1:12:37.900 --> 1:12:40.100\n That's really the whole reason I was there.\n\n1:12:41.220 --> 1:12:43.300\n Can you describe close quarter battle?\n\n1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:46.820\n Close quarter battle is team fighting.\n\n1:12:46.820 --> 1:12:50.420\n So, and it can look a lot of different ways,\n\n1:12:50.420 --> 1:12:55.420\n but basically it's ground troops doing something\n\n1:12:55.420 --> 1:13:00.420\n and it's ground troops doing some kind of a mission.\n\n1:13:00.460 --> 1:13:04.180\n And it's the orchestrated movement that is the skill.\n\n1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:08.060\n The orchestrated movement and the drills done quickly\n\n1:13:08.060 --> 1:13:10.140\n and accurately, it's very difficult to do.\n\n1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.740\n With communication?\n\n1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:12.580\n With communication.\n\n1:13:12.580 --> 1:13:16.260\n Yeah, so it's basically cooperating together,\n\n1:13:16.260 --> 1:13:18.260\n communicating, there's some strategy,\n\n1:13:18.260 --> 1:13:20.900\n there's some adapting to the changing environment.\n\n1:13:20.900 --> 1:13:22.420\n And the more the team works together,\n\n1:13:22.420 --> 1:13:24.060\n the less communication there is.\n\n1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:26.220\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:13:26.220 --> 1:13:28.140\n And that's an amazing thing to do,\n\n1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:30.740\n to be part of a machine, well, machine,\n\n1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:35.020\n a team of people who can fight together like that.\n\n1:13:35.780 --> 1:13:39.900\n I think it's, we're really designed to do it.\n\n1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:42.700\n Like, as good as we can fight as individuals,\n\n1:13:42.700 --> 1:13:43.940\n the thing that makes us really good\n\n1:13:43.940 --> 1:13:46.420\n is our ability to fight as a team.\n\n1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:47.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:47.740 --> 1:13:50.500\n Yeah, that's one of the things that makes us really human\n\n1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:52.940\n is that collective intelligence, that social aspect.\n\n1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:56.620\n And fighting is the highest of stakes.\n\n1:13:56.620 --> 1:13:59.260\n So that social interaction under the highest of stakes\n\n1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:04.260\n is, really does bring out something that's deeply human.\n\n1:14:06.340 --> 1:14:10.380\n I mean, war in general brings out something deeply human.\n\n1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:11.580\n It does.\n\n1:14:11.580 --> 1:14:15.380\n It's, I mean, obvious to say that it's tragic\n\n1:14:15.380 --> 1:14:20.380\n that it results in so much loss of life and well being.\n\n1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:25.380\n Let me, if it's okay, for a brief moment\n\n1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:28.700\n to take us back to arm wrestling.\n\n1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:31.660\n We did this offline, we talked about,\n\n1:14:31.660 --> 1:14:34.020\n you gave me some advice about arm wrestling.\n\n1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:35.820\n But maybe do a high level overview\n\n1:14:35.820 --> 1:14:40.820\n of the different styles and strategies\n\n1:14:42.500 --> 1:14:43.420\n that we've talked about.\n\n1:14:43.420 --> 1:14:46.640\n We talked about the importance of strength and power.\n\n1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:49.940\n But is there offensive, defensive styles?\n\n1:14:49.940 --> 1:14:52.700\n Is there, we mentioned King's move.\n\n1:14:52.700 --> 1:14:55.780\n What would you classify your style as?\n\n1:14:55.780 --> 1:14:58.300\n It's nice for people that don't know.\n\n1:14:58.300 --> 1:14:59.700\n Maybe even zoom back out.\n\n1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:04.700\n So arm wrestling is a sport where two people have to,\n\n1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:09.800\n when we talk about strictly the sport,\n\n1:15:09.800 --> 1:15:12.180\n put their elbow on a particular pad,\n\n1:15:12.180 --> 1:15:15.420\n means they have to keep that elbow on that pad.\n\n1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:20.420\n And they win when the back of one of their hands\n\n1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:23.820\n crosses some kind of, or basically touches the table.\n\n1:15:23.820 --> 1:15:24.820\n That's it.\n\n1:15:24.820 --> 1:15:29.820\n And when you actually lock up, you do so,\n\n1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.720\n depending on the organization, without straps,\n\n1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:37.840\n meaning there's just you, agree, it's like mutual agreement\n\n1:15:37.840 --> 1:15:42.840\n that you're going to clasp your hands in a way that's fair\n\n1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:45.560\n and there's a referee that helps ensure that it's fair.\n\n1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.880\n But of course there's these little games going on.\n\n1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:51.300\n And then when you actually go all out with this battle,\n\n1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:53.800\n if there's no straps, you can slip out.\n\n1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:57.040\n So often you'll put the straps, which means you're,\n\n1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:01.520\n it's like marriage, you're committed for,\n\n1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:04.280\n like somebody will have to lose essentially.\n\n1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:05.540\n There's no pulling out.\n\n1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:11.240\n So that's sort of the battle within that.\n\n1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:13.440\n What are the different styles that you can speak to\n\n1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.560\n that people that don't know arm wrestling could understand?\n\n1:16:17.560 --> 1:16:19.260\n Yeah, we can start to kind of just dance\n\n1:16:19.260 --> 1:16:21.120\n around the subject a bit.\n\n1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:25.840\n I'd say there's a lot of different types.\n\n1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:30.840\n There's specialists and there's kind of blenders\n\n1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:33.000\n and people who are very versatile.\n\n1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:38.280\n A lot of guys win world championships on one singular move.\n\n1:16:38.280 --> 1:16:43.280\n They get just extremely crisp at say a hook or a top roll.\n\n1:16:43.700 --> 1:16:46.900\n And their style is very kind of focused.\n\n1:16:46.900 --> 1:16:49.560\n And you'll see it with a lot of athletes,\n\n1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:54.160\n like kind of a talk about guy who's very active,\n\n1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:55.880\n a guy called Jerry Cataret.\n\n1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:57.740\n As soon as you think Jerry Cataret,\n\n1:16:57.740 --> 1:16:58.960\n he's got a very unique style.\n\n1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:01.040\n He's got a flop wrist press.\n\n1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:04.680\n So most of his technique is built around this one system.\n\n1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:09.680\n Flop wrist means what it sounds like.\n\n1:17:09.760 --> 1:17:12.760\n Your wrist is flopped, so it looks like you're losing.\n\n1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:15.480\n So he is pushing from a losing position.\n\n1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:18.060\n No, he will be offensive.\n\n1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:20.360\n So he will be in a press, so offensively,\n\n1:17:20.360 --> 1:17:22.500\n so he'll give his hand away\n\n1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:24.720\n so that he can get his shoulder behind it properly.\n\n1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:27.360\n So he doesn't, wow.\n\n1:17:27.360 --> 1:17:31.160\n So you can press, press means push.\n\n1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:36.160\n Push, yeah, without having that hook position.\n\n1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:40.320\n Which is what most people are always looking for.\n\n1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:41.800\n And Jerry's looking for it as well.\n\n1:17:41.800 --> 1:17:43.720\n And then, so example, there's another one.\n\n1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:45.880\n There's another specialist, Matt Mask.\n\n1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:47.760\n He's a top roller, right?\n\n1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:51.760\n Basically, that's his great move is a top roll.\n\n1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:54.720\n And his other weapons aren't nearly as powerful.\n\n1:17:55.720 --> 1:17:57.840\n Just incredible top roll.\n\n1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:00.760\n And then you have a lot of athletes that are more blended.\n\n1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:02.360\n They have a lot of good options.\n\n1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:07.120\n I think that I probably fall more into that category.\n\n1:18:07.120 --> 1:18:10.760\n You have people who are more speed guys, okay?\n\n1:18:10.760 --> 1:18:15.760\n So they try and do very little, I call it attrition, right?\n\n1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:21.400\n So a lot of people are very willing to trade energy, right?\n\n1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.600\n Because they have faith that their gas tank\n\n1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:27.280\n or their pool eventually will tire the other person out.\n\n1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:30.280\n So anytime there's a trade, they'll trade.\n\n1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:32.520\n Whereas a guy like Travis Bajan,\n\n1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:35.800\n he was very, very well known\n\n1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:38.600\n as being extremely explosive, right?\n\n1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:42.260\n But if the match stops, typically he's gonna lose.\n\n1:18:43.160 --> 1:18:47.600\n All right, so based off of your genetics, your hands,\n\n1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:50.560\n there's a lot of ways to skin it.\n\n1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:55.560\n So I think you said something like you're a 22nd guy.\n\n1:18:55.560 --> 1:19:00.280\n That's right, I'm a 22nd guy.\n\n1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:03.220\n So what are the seconds we're talking about?\n\n1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:04.760\n So a lot of the power people,\n\n1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:06.840\n they want to win in the first maybe five seconds,\n\n1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:10.880\n like just that first push, that first press.\n\n1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:14.600\n Absolutely, right to the pad, yeah.\n\n1:19:14.600 --> 1:19:17.400\n And so you're trying to hold off that attack.\n\n1:19:17.400 --> 1:19:19.440\n Yeah, if I beat you in a second,\n\n1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:21.720\n we're not in the same world, yeah.\n\n1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.580\n But when I'm with my peer group,\n\n1:19:25.580 --> 1:19:28.900\n I will typically win 20 seconds and beyond.\n\n1:19:28.900 --> 1:19:31.800\n That's a typical win for me when I'm with a peer.\n\n1:19:33.180 --> 1:19:35.780\n Whereas other guys, when they're with their peers,\n\n1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:37.380\n they'll win in a second, right?\n\n1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:40.060\n That's how they do it, that's the way they're built,\n\n1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:41.700\n that's the way they train.\n\n1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:46.100\n Yeah, most guys at a higher level at all\n\n1:19:46.100 --> 1:19:49.380\n starts to kind of, it starts to get more and more difficult\n\n1:19:49.380 --> 1:19:51.860\n to be a specialist at the high level now.\n\n1:19:51.860 --> 1:19:54.300\n Some people just have little holes in their games.\n\n1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:00.380\n It's rare to get someone who can really do all the moves.\n\n1:20:00.380 --> 1:20:01.460\n It's very rare.\n\n1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:05.620\n Where would you put Levan?\n\n1:20:06.740 --> 1:20:08.740\n I would not say he's a specialist.\n\n1:20:08.740 --> 1:20:11.700\n I'd say his top roll is his strongest move.\n\n1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:12.540\n Top roll?\n\n1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:14.780\n Top roll is his strongest move, yeah.\n\n1:20:14.780 --> 1:20:18.700\n And the interesting thing about the specialist\n\n1:20:18.700 --> 1:20:23.700\n versus the blender, there's a counter, right?\n\n1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:27.420\n Every move has a move that theoretically\n\n1:20:27.420 --> 1:20:29.460\n should be the right choice.\n\n1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:31.760\n So if you're a single move guy,\n\n1:20:33.300 --> 1:20:35.700\n there's gonna be a guy out there who'll get you.\n\n1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:38.460\n Yeah, it'll be very difficult for you to beat that guy.\n\n1:20:39.460 --> 1:20:43.220\n But when you come to a tournament,\n\n1:20:43.220 --> 1:20:45.660\n typically specialists do much better\n\n1:20:45.660 --> 1:20:49.460\n in tournament scenarios because their singular move\n\n1:20:49.460 --> 1:20:50.940\n can get them through a tournament\n\n1:20:50.940 --> 1:20:53.140\n very quickly and efficiently.\n\n1:20:53.140 --> 1:20:55.340\n Whereas you get a blender in a tournament,\n\n1:20:55.340 --> 1:20:58.980\n they typically will have longer and more difficult matches.\n\n1:20:58.980 --> 1:21:00.980\n And by, oh, right, yeah.\n\n1:21:00.980 --> 1:21:05.860\n But in supermatch format, typically blenders do better.\n\n1:21:06.780 --> 1:21:09.700\n So we offline also talked about arm sumo\n\n1:21:09.700 --> 1:21:11.540\n or freedom arm wrestling.\n\n1:21:11.540 --> 1:21:12.740\n I don't know how you wanna call it.\n\n1:21:12.740 --> 1:21:13.740\n Oh, I love freedom.\n\n1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:18.740\n Well, exactly, North American way.\n\n1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:25.420\n So this is this idea, and I watched a few videos,\n\n1:21:25.420 --> 1:21:29.020\n and it looks fun, is basically removing the restriction\n\n1:21:29.020 --> 1:21:32.120\n of having to keep your elbow on the pad\n\n1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:35.420\n and just being able to arm wrestle over the whole table.\n\n1:21:35.420 --> 1:21:38.040\n I think you've mentioned that the criticism that gets\n\n1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.820\n is it might be injury prone or something like that.\n\n1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:44.260\n So can you describe this arm sumo, freedom arm wrestling\n\n1:21:44.260 --> 1:21:45.540\n idea?\n\n1:21:45.540 --> 1:21:47.520\n When you come to freedom arm wrestling,\n\n1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:50.620\n basically it removes the limitation\n\n1:21:50.620 --> 1:21:52.820\n of a standard arm wrestling table.\n\n1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:54.420\n So basically every single thing\n\n1:21:54.420 --> 1:21:56.040\n is a freedom arm wrestling table.\n\n1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:57.900\n Some are better than others.\n\n1:21:57.900 --> 1:22:00.700\n So looking for that nice table where we can kind of\n\n1:22:00.700 --> 1:22:04.420\n stand apart from each other and we're anatomically\n\n1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:07.020\n in a fairly safe position.\n\n1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:09.740\n And the rules in freedom, the way you win,\n\n1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:14.100\n is the knuckles must either touch the tabletop\n\n1:22:14.100 --> 1:22:17.940\n or you hold it off the edge for a three count.\n\n1:22:18.820 --> 1:22:20.180\n So this is the main way to win.\n\n1:22:20.180 --> 1:22:21.980\n Yes, you can foul, like if you lift your elbow up,\n\n1:22:21.980 --> 1:22:25.140\n it's still a foul, but you have the entire playing surface.\n\n1:22:25.140 --> 1:22:28.040\n So your elbow's no longer limited to your seven by seven\n\n1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:30.940\n or seven by nine pad, so you can move it all over the table.\n\n1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:33.980\n You can move your body around the table a bit too.\n\n1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:36.100\n And if it's a big table, your body\n\n1:22:36.100 --> 1:22:38.180\n could largely be on the table.\n\n1:22:38.180 --> 1:22:41.060\n Yeah, so basically it's like adjusting your ring size.\n\n1:22:41.060 --> 1:22:44.620\n So arm wrestling, you're fighting in a phone booth, right?\n\n1:22:44.620 --> 1:22:47.860\n So you're fighting in a field, you're fighting just bigger.\n\n1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:50.200\n So it just makes the sport bigger.\n\n1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:51.420\n Yeah, this is Japan.\n\n1:22:51.420 --> 1:22:55.840\n But even on a small table, even in a slightly larger\n\n1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:59.460\n phone booth, you can get a lot more fun and variety.\n\n1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:00.300\n It's very interesting to watch.\n\n1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:01.380\n I love it.\n\n1:23:01.380 --> 1:23:02.780\n I think it makes the sport bigger.\n\n1:23:02.780 --> 1:23:05.420\n I actually believe that it's the future of the sport.\n\n1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:06.780\n I really do.\n\n1:23:06.780 --> 1:23:08.060\n Because it makes it more accessible.\n\n1:23:08.060 --> 1:23:09.220\n Like you don't need the equipment.\n\n1:23:09.220 --> 1:23:11.260\n You can do it at a bar, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:23:11.260 --> 1:23:14.320\n Yeah, less equipment requirements.\n\n1:23:15.660 --> 1:23:16.960\n Most kids start freedom.\n\n1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:19.740\n Like most kids arm wrestle on school desks.\n\n1:23:19.740 --> 1:23:22.180\n And like if you see a guy on the street, you're like,\n\n1:23:22.180 --> 1:23:23.660\n whatever, you can arm wrestle anywhere.\n\n1:23:23.660 --> 1:23:26.380\n You don't need to bring your table around with you.\n\n1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:29.800\n If we talked about the elite level,\n\n1:23:29.800 --> 1:23:34.800\n if somebody was interested in starting in arm wrestling\n\n1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:39.800\n or going from just like, you go to the gym,\n\n1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:43.800\n you kind of lift, you've arm wrestled a few times,\n\n1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:45.880\n trying to get better at it, trying to learn.\n\n1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:49.480\n How would you advise getting better to where you can\n\n1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.920\n beat your closest buddies?\n\n1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:53.240\n That first step.\n\n1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:56.680\n First step, I'd say find people.\n\n1:23:56.680 --> 1:23:57.800\n Find people.\n\n1:23:57.800 --> 1:23:58.980\n Find good people.\n\n1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:01.480\n Volume.\n\n1:24:01.480 --> 1:24:02.320\n Well, get with a club.\n\n1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:03.520\n Get with people who know what they're doing,\n\n1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.000\n who can mentor you.\n\n1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:06.460\n And that's really cool.\n\n1:24:06.460 --> 1:24:08.640\n I realized there's a club in Austin.\n\n1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:09.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:10.300\n I'm sure there's in a lot of places.\n\n1:24:10.300 --> 1:24:11.140\n Oh, they're everywhere.\n\n1:24:11.140 --> 1:24:14.200\n We got this app called Armbet.\n\n1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:15.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:18.040\n Which is a app that helps you find other people there.\n\n1:24:18.040 --> 1:24:19.320\n Yeah, very easy.\n\n1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:21.480\n But I mean, they're all over social networks.\n\n1:24:21.480 --> 1:24:24.520\n I mean, it's kind of widespread now.\n\n1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:26.680\n But yeah, find people.\n\n1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:30.440\n Find people and it's just much easier to learn\n\n1:24:30.440 --> 1:24:33.740\n with another person and you'll get stronger that way.\n\n1:24:33.740 --> 1:24:36.360\n But I mean, do the lifts.\n\n1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:39.580\n I mean, if you go to the gym, just start doing the lifts.\n\n1:24:39.580 --> 1:24:42.960\n And right away, those will technically prepare you.\n\n1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:44.400\n What are the lifts?\n\n1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:45.240\n Can we describe what the first one is?\n\n1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:48.160\n Yeah, so I'd say if you wanna just keep it\n\n1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:50.840\n very, very simple, let's just talk about three.\n\n1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:52.840\n There's much more than three.\n\n1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:56.120\n But when you talk about energy allocation,\n\n1:24:56.120 --> 1:24:58.680\n these three lifts, in my opinion,\n\n1:24:58.680 --> 1:25:03.320\n should be like 90% of your investment.\n\n1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:05.040\n It's very big, these three lifts.\n\n1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:10.560\n And the exact percentages, you can argue about it,\n\n1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:14.200\n but we'll start off with the cupping of the wrist.\n\n1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:16.220\n Just this, it's a simple thing.\n\n1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:17.880\n And do it with a cable.\n\n1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:22.480\n You can get a thicker diameter, so it kind of\n\n1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:25.000\n is more out on your fingers where an armrest\n\n1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:26.320\n is gonna attack you.\n\n1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:28.500\n Because any good armrest is gonna attack your fingers.\n\n1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.080\n So like open hand.\n\n1:25:30.080 --> 1:25:31.280\n No, no.\n\n1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:33.880\n Well, I mean, for health, yes, you could.\n\n1:25:33.880 --> 1:25:35.980\n But if you wanna be really specific,\n\n1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:38.700\n you train exactly the way you would at a table.\n\n1:25:38.700 --> 1:25:40.960\n In the position that you actually start that match.\n\n1:25:40.960 --> 1:25:43.520\n Yeah, and then you're just doing this kind of thing.\n\n1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:45.200\n Yes, to your center.\n\n1:25:47.080 --> 1:25:50.320\n One of the big misconceptions in armwrestling\n\n1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:52.760\n is that you're aiming for that pin pad.\n\n1:25:53.860 --> 1:25:54.700\n No.\n\n1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:56.140\n The center.\n\n1:25:56.140 --> 1:25:56.980\n The chest up here.\n\n1:25:56.980 --> 1:25:58.200\n Bring it close to you.\n\n1:25:58.200 --> 1:25:59.760\n Make it come close to you, right?\n\n1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:02.080\n You see like whenever I do my exercises,\n\n1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:05.560\n the vector is always pulling straight towards me.\n\n1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:06.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.040\n Yeah, so just cupping close to you.\n\n1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.520\n The most dangerous thing that a person can do to me\n\n1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:15.400\n on an armwrestling match is just pull me away from my body.\n\n1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:17.440\n That's a terrible thing for me.\n\n1:26:17.440 --> 1:26:22.440\n Yeah, so that cupping, that's a massive part of the sport.\n\n1:26:23.820 --> 1:26:26.980\n So now when you think what does the cup do\n\n1:26:26.980 --> 1:26:31.980\n to the other person, if I cup, they get turned over.\n\n1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:33.160\n Right?\n\n1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:35.120\n So this has to get really strong.\n\n1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:37.680\n This pronation.\n\n1:26:39.340 --> 1:26:42.960\n So to fight that rolling.\n\n1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:44.280\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n1:26:44.280 --> 1:26:47.240\n So that's through the thumb.\n\n1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:48.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:48.080 --> 1:26:51.080\n Oh, so you put, got it, you put on the thumb\n\n1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.820\n and you put this motion.\n\n1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:53.680\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:54.520\n Got it.\n\n1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:55.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:57.240\n So those two things, those two things together,\n\n1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:00.360\n this cupping and rolling, this is what's gonna make\n\n1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:03.520\n the person's hand bend back, and once the person's hand\n\n1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:07.960\n is bent back, just their whole game gets cut to pieces.\n\n1:27:07.960 --> 1:27:09.880\n They have very little good options.\n\n1:27:09.880 --> 1:27:12.140\n It's all like nasty stuff.\n\n1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:12.980\n Wow.\n\n1:27:12.980 --> 1:27:16.000\n Yeah, so those two things, that's a huge part\n\n1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.040\n of your investment.\n\n1:27:19.600 --> 1:27:20.440\n Rise.\n\n1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:22.920\n Always be climbing.\n\n1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:24.740\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:28.760\n Yeah, those three simple things, that's what I would tell\n\n1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:31.200\n anybody to spend most of their time on if you wanna\n\n1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:32.360\n become an art wrestler.\n\n1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:35.660\n So bands would be good for this?\n\n1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:37.960\n Bands are great because they're easy to transport.\n\n1:27:37.960 --> 1:27:41.420\n The only problem I have with bands is like if you like\n\n1:27:41.420 --> 1:27:43.740\n to measure, you know, and if you like to be precise,\n\n1:27:43.740 --> 1:27:45.240\n bands just aren't that precise.\n\n1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:46.760\n Right, so to have growth.\n\n1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:47.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:50.000\n Just, I mean, it's just like, you know, you know exactly\n\n1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.680\n what you need, the prescription is kind of, a band\n\n1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:55.680\n is kind of like, and a lot of people, myself included,\n\n1:27:55.680 --> 1:28:00.680\n I like to know exactly my outputs, so weights.\n\n1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.200\n So would it be like cables?\n\n1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:05.240\n Yep.\n\n1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:06.120\n Cables are nice.\n\n1:28:06.120 --> 1:28:07.120\n Bands are great, too.\n\n1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:08.720\n I mix the two.\n\n1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:13.720\n Bands are when I kind of don't need to, they're more\n\n1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:15.760\n like easy for me.\n\n1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.360\n When I train bands, bands are dangerous\n\n1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.160\n because the acceleration is so high on them.\n\n1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:22.000\n Like when you screw up with band training,\n\n1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.320\n the acceleration is way faster than gravity, right?\n\n1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:28.280\n So if you do something bad, it can make it go\n\n1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:29.560\n really much worse.\n\n1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:30.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:35.040\n It's funny that you didn't mention bicep curls or.\n\n1:28:35.040 --> 1:28:36.700\n Well, it's a chain.\n\n1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:37.540\n It's a chain.\n\n1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:40.560\n And so you're, I mean, the idea if you focus on these three,\n\n1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:43.360\n the other stuff catches up, like it's all involved.\n\n1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.040\n This whole thing is involved.\n\n1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:50.040\n So if you have an ax, right, the blade of the ax,\n\n1:28:50.040 --> 1:28:54.220\n that's these things, right?\n\n1:28:54.220 --> 1:28:57.420\n Like you need the pointy end of all your attacks\n\n1:28:57.420 --> 1:28:59.500\n to be awesome, right?\n\n1:28:59.500 --> 1:29:02.020\n If you have a super sharp ax, you could have\n\n1:29:02.020 --> 1:29:03.540\n a shitty handle.\n\n1:29:03.540 --> 1:29:05.100\n Yeah, right?\n\n1:29:05.100 --> 1:29:08.860\n Yeah, so focus on that, the tip of the ax.\n\n1:29:08.860 --> 1:29:11.140\n Yeah, the tip of the ax is so important, right?\n\n1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.100\n Like if I have an awesome bicep and I can't quite use it,\n\n1:29:15.100 --> 1:29:16.660\n what's it good for, right?\n\n1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:19.060\n Yeah, I think a lot of the motions with the wrist\n\n1:29:19.060 --> 1:29:22.420\n that you mentioned are, just thinking about jiu jitsu,\n\n1:29:22.420 --> 1:29:25.940\n especially in the gi, there's a lot of,\n\n1:29:25.940 --> 1:29:27.680\n I mean, there's so much importance to this,\n\n1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:32.660\n and people don't often work it explicitly.\n\n1:29:32.660 --> 1:29:35.420\n So many of the chokes require ability to,\n\n1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:37.500\n it's almost like exactly like arm wrestling.\n\n1:29:37.500 --> 1:29:38.340\n Very close.\n\n1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.020\n Because you're weak here, what's that called,\n\n1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:45.460\n flop wrist, and you're strong with the cup, yeah.\n\n1:29:45.460 --> 1:29:49.740\n And so just getting the, whatever that's involved,\n\n1:29:49.740 --> 1:29:51.380\n the muscle, the turning, the pressure,\n\n1:29:51.380 --> 1:29:54.140\n because that's where also the choke comes.\n\n1:29:54.140 --> 1:29:57.740\n That little, the thing that makes you win in arm wrestling\n\n1:29:57.740 --> 1:30:00.340\n is also the thing that finishes the person\n\n1:30:00.340 --> 1:30:02.180\n when you have them grabbed.\n\n1:30:02.180 --> 1:30:03.740\n The strength is very similar.\n\n1:30:03.740 --> 1:30:05.500\n Yeah, it's fascinating, actually.\n\n1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:08.300\n Of course, like you said, if you wanna be very good,\n\n1:30:08.300 --> 1:30:12.060\n you should be doing the very specific exact motion.\n\n1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:13.660\n Yeah, so if I was gonna do jiu jitsu,\n\n1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:15.620\n I'd be like working out with the gi.\n\n1:30:15.620 --> 1:30:18.540\n Yeah, the problem is, you know,\n\n1:30:18.540 --> 1:30:23.540\n it's difficult to construct the exact,\n\n1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.700\n so you have to actually go with people,\n\n1:30:25.700 --> 1:30:28.980\n and then they don't like being choked on, right?\n\n1:30:28.980 --> 1:30:31.660\n So like it's hard to, I'm actually a big,\n\n1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.820\n we have these kinds of debates all the time,\n\n1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:38.460\n is, you know, I'm a big believer in drilling.\n\n1:30:38.460 --> 1:30:40.780\n I love doing something thousands of times.\n\n1:30:40.780 --> 1:30:43.580\n Like John Donahoe is somebody I mentioned to you about\n\n1:30:43.580 --> 1:30:46.020\n who, the jiu jitsu folks here,\n\n1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:48.020\n they're less believers in drilling.\n\n1:30:48.020 --> 1:30:52.300\n They see the value of almost like the mind\n\n1:30:52.300 --> 1:30:55.420\n of going live and exploring ideas.\n\n1:30:55.420 --> 1:30:56.620\n It's that play.\n\n1:30:56.620 --> 1:30:58.980\n You don't need to do the thing a thousand times.\n\n1:30:58.980 --> 1:31:02.020\n You just need to always be thinking about\n\n1:31:02.020 --> 1:31:05.260\n the little details that make you better,\n\n1:31:05.260 --> 1:31:07.340\n and then in action practicing,\n\n1:31:07.340 --> 1:31:09.980\n like developing the strength, the power,\n\n1:31:09.980 --> 1:31:12.420\n the explosive of the agility in action.\n\n1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:14.100\n So actually rolling.\n\n1:31:14.100 --> 1:31:16.900\n I don't, you know, I agree with this,\n\n1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:20.100\n but I just believe in volume more.\n\n1:31:20.100 --> 1:31:22.180\n Yeah, so you can accomplish it through volume.\n\n1:31:22.180 --> 1:31:24.780\n You can play a lot.\n\n1:31:24.780 --> 1:31:25.740\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:31:25.740 --> 1:31:28.460\n Well, that's the, if you really wanna get it good\n\n1:31:28.460 --> 1:31:30.780\n is you're talking about, I mean,\n\n1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:33.660\n that's why a lot of these folks are training\n\n1:31:33.660 --> 1:31:34.500\n three times a day.\n\n1:31:34.500 --> 1:31:37.020\n They're doing, you know, they're putting in the hours,\n\n1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:40.140\n eight hours, nine hours, just.\n\n1:31:40.140 --> 1:31:41.900\n Well, that's tough, oh my God.\n\n1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:44.060\n Well, so there are a lot of them are not going hard.\n\n1:31:44.060 --> 1:31:45.420\n It's just being on the mat.\n\n1:31:45.420 --> 1:31:48.020\n Some of it is just sitting there talking through ideas,\n\n1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:50.780\n watching others or teaching, explaining stuff.\n\n1:31:50.780 --> 1:31:53.820\n It's just, it's like, it's not just physical.\n\n1:31:53.820 --> 1:31:56.860\n It's mental too, because you're keeping in your mind.\n\n1:31:56.860 --> 1:32:01.300\n And some of the greatest, they talk about the wrestlers\n\n1:32:01.300 --> 1:32:05.740\n I've talked with, the fighters, at the top of their career,\n\n1:32:05.740 --> 1:32:10.340\n they basically, George St. Pierre is like this,\n\n1:32:10.340 --> 1:32:14.260\n another fellow Canadian, is like,\n\n1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:17.340\n has stick figures in his head that he can't help.\n\n1:32:17.340 --> 1:32:20.860\n They're like in there, because if you train enough hours,\n\n1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:23.420\n you're, it's just gonna be in your head\n\n1:32:23.420 --> 1:32:25.780\n and they're all going to be playing around in your head.\n\n1:32:25.780 --> 1:32:27.860\n And some little detail over time,\n\n1:32:27.860 --> 1:32:29.740\n it's almost like computing or something like that.\n\n1:32:29.740 --> 1:32:32.540\n And that ends up having a result\n\n1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:34.740\n even though you're not physically doing anything.\n\n1:32:34.740 --> 1:32:36.700\n It's always in there.\n\n1:32:36.700 --> 1:32:41.280\n I do have to return to diet real quick.\n\n1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:42.840\n I know we talk about pancakes.\n\n1:32:42.840 --> 1:32:47.840\n Let me, quite seriously, you are one of the,\n\n1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:54.140\n I mean, strongest athletes in the world for your sport.\n\n1:32:54.140 --> 1:32:56.360\n So you have to get big, you have to get powerful,\n\n1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:57.760\n you have to get strong.\n\n1:32:59.100 --> 1:33:02.060\n What is the right diet for you for that?\n\n1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:04.380\n Like, what do you eat?\n\n1:33:04.380 --> 1:33:09.380\n How often do you eat, yeah, from the highest detail\n\n1:33:10.500 --> 1:33:12.860\n to the smallest, or the things that make you happy\n\n1:33:12.860 --> 1:33:13.780\n and feel good?\n\n1:33:13.780 --> 1:33:17.820\n Yeah, I've experimented with every diet.\n\n1:33:17.820 --> 1:33:22.080\n I've done it all, I've been a vegan, I've done raw,\n\n1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:26.220\n I've eaten only meat, I've eaten balanced,\n\n1:33:26.220 --> 1:33:31.140\n I've eaten like a bodybuilder, you know, you name it,\n\n1:33:31.140 --> 1:33:36.140\n I've probably tried it, I don't believe\n\n1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:40.360\n that it's as important in the sport of arm wrestling\n\n1:33:40.360 --> 1:33:42.540\n as it is perhaps in other sports.\n\n1:33:43.540 --> 1:33:47.380\n I believe that, I mean, just to be very basic,\n\n1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:49.160\n I mean, if you're eating enough food,\n\n1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:50.660\n you're probably gonna be okay.\n\n1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:54.060\n So it's just calories.\n\n1:33:54.060 --> 1:33:57.020\n I mean, really, I mean, not to overcomplicate it,\n\n1:33:57.020 --> 1:33:59.060\n but I mean, that's where the conversation starts\n\n1:33:59.060 --> 1:34:01.620\n where you're eating enough food.\n\n1:34:01.620 --> 1:34:04.580\n And it can come in any number of ways,\n\n1:34:04.580 --> 1:34:08.420\n and I don't think it's as important\n\n1:34:08.420 --> 1:34:11.140\n as a lot of other people do.\n\n1:34:11.140 --> 1:34:13.680\n I'm certainly irresponsible in a lot,\n\n1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:17.420\n but the thing is, back to like, volume, right?\n\n1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:20.140\n Like, you need to, like, if you wanna be\n\n1:34:20.140 --> 1:34:23.720\n a super heavyweight, it's very different\n\n1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:26.060\n than if you wanna be a weight category guy.\n\n1:34:26.060 --> 1:34:27.780\n If you wanna be a weight category guy,\n\n1:34:27.780 --> 1:34:30.180\n I'd say that you need to be more responsible,\n\n1:34:30.180 --> 1:34:32.020\n make better choices.\n\n1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:36.100\n If you wanna be a super heavyweight, everything.\n\n1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:38.340\n Just so we're watching a delicious looking omelet,\n\n1:34:38.340 --> 1:34:42.180\n so eggs, bacon, syrup, so you don't care, carbs.\n\n1:34:42.180 --> 1:34:46.460\n So in all the things you try, so I mostly eat meat now.\n\n1:34:46.460 --> 1:34:50.060\n And I landed on that, there's several things,\n\n1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:53.420\n obviously I'm not, but I do a lot of sport.\n\n1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:55.660\n And I was very surprised how my particular,\n\n1:34:55.660 --> 1:35:00.620\n very specific body could perform better with only meat.\n\n1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:01.500\n Why better?\n\n1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:03.300\n The sports I do, the mind matters.\n\n1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:06.180\n And so for some reason, my mind's just clear.\n\n1:35:06.180 --> 1:35:09.020\n And I don't think, because it feels unhealthy.\n\n1:35:09.020 --> 1:35:10.820\n It just makes me feel really good.\n\n1:35:10.820 --> 1:35:13.740\n I don't think I would recommend it to anybody else.\n\n1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:18.740\n So it's interesting that that journey of just exploring\n\n1:35:19.500 --> 1:35:22.960\n can take you to figure out something about your own self.\n\n1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:25.620\n One of the most interesting things that I heard about\n\n1:35:25.620 --> 1:35:29.140\n nutrition was, I heard there was a.\n\n1:35:29.140 --> 1:35:31.220\n Actually, Doritos, I forgot about that.\n\n1:35:31.220 --> 1:35:33.100\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm an idiot.\n\n1:35:35.100 --> 1:35:38.100\n Now, I'd say over the last couple of years,\n\n1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:42.060\n I've really gone into carbs a lot and high glycemic carbs.\n\n1:35:42.060 --> 1:35:44.580\n And just to, I feel like it's one of the best things\n\n1:35:44.580 --> 1:35:45.980\n you can do if you're working out really hard.\n\n1:35:45.980 --> 1:35:48.620\n Just add carbs, yeah, exactly.\n\n1:35:48.620 --> 1:35:53.620\n But, oh, where was I?\n\n1:35:55.180 --> 1:35:59.980\n So you've added, syrup is so delicious it's distracting.\n\n1:35:59.980 --> 1:36:03.540\n No, so you've added the high glycemic carbs into the mix.\n\n1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:06.580\n So those help, but that's for mass building.\n\n1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:10.140\n Right, so there was a study that I heard about\n\n1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:12.940\n by somebody who was trying to identify heart attacks.\n\n1:36:12.940 --> 1:36:14.640\n They did this great big study.\n\n1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:17.100\n And at the end of it, I mean, didn't matter\n\n1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:20.820\n what the people ate, the most important thing\n\n1:36:20.820 --> 1:36:23.700\n was how they felt about the food that they were eating.\n\n1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:27.580\n Yeah, so if you believe in the food,\n\n1:36:27.580 --> 1:36:30.660\n if you believe that it's gonna do good things for you,\n\n1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.820\n if you allocate it the right way,\n\n1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:35.420\n it's gonna have a positive impact.\n\n1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:37.400\n And I try and do that no matter what it is.\n\n1:36:37.400 --> 1:36:40.140\n Like I have my foods that I think do certain things.\n\n1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:44.980\n And so, you know, for me, I know that,\n\n1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:48.300\n actually, I mean, I learned about corn fed pumps\n\n1:36:48.300 --> 1:36:49.920\n when I was overseas.\n\n1:36:50.900 --> 1:36:55.380\n I realized that I never used to eat crap, really didn't.\n\n1:36:55.380 --> 1:36:57.700\n I ate super clean all the time.\n\n1:36:58.580 --> 1:37:03.580\n And when I was faced with imminent death more,\n\n1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:07.940\n I would be like, okay, I'm going out tonight,\n\n1:37:07.940 --> 1:37:10.640\n let's have a couple ice cream bars.\n\n1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:12.100\n You know, like whatever.\n\n1:37:12.100 --> 1:37:17.100\n And what I realized is if I eat like an entire bag of chips\n\n1:37:18.820 --> 1:37:21.720\n or like, you know, a bunch of chocolate bars,\n\n1:37:22.860 --> 1:37:25.020\n and then I go and have a workout,\n\n1:37:25.020 --> 1:37:27.460\n my workout will be incredible.\n\n1:37:27.460 --> 1:37:28.660\n It'll be incredible.\n\n1:37:30.300 --> 1:37:35.220\n There's something about easily processed carbohydrates\n\n1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:40.220\n that will continue to quickly get into your blood\n\n1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:42.860\n as fast as you can burn it.\n\n1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:45.620\n And there's something about that\n\n1:37:45.620 --> 1:37:50.620\n that will give you incredible blood flow, yeah.\n\n1:37:51.420 --> 1:37:54.060\n And also your mind plugging in, enjoying that.\n\n1:37:54.060 --> 1:37:54.900\n Right.\n\n1:37:54.900 --> 1:37:56.380\n And then believing it works,\n\n1:37:56.380 --> 1:37:58.600\n and that's how it makes it work better.\n\n1:37:58.600 --> 1:37:59.440\n Exactly.\n\n1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:01.160\n I mean, I feel that way.\n\n1:38:01.160 --> 1:38:03.280\n I think this is really not,\n\n1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:04.700\n this has been frustrating to me\n\n1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:07.260\n about the health culture in the United States\n\n1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:09.900\n in the studies that are done.\n\n1:38:09.900 --> 1:38:12.140\n You know, you look at like the importance of sleep,\n\n1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:16.060\n the importance of X diet, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:38:16.060 --> 1:38:19.380\n I wish incorporated into that would be\n\n1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:22.460\n your mental relationship with all of these things.\n\n1:38:22.460 --> 1:38:23.980\n So for example, people that tell me,\n\n1:38:23.980 --> 1:38:26.500\n well, your sleep schedule is insane.\n\n1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:28.860\n Yes, perhaps.\n\n1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:32.660\n But also, it's insane because I'm doing what I love\n\n1:38:32.660 --> 1:38:34.340\n and I don't see it as a problem.\n\n1:38:34.340 --> 1:38:35.180\n Right.\n\n1:38:35.180 --> 1:38:38.740\n And I think that's really important to understand.\n\n1:38:38.740 --> 1:38:43.180\n If you sleeping crazy hours\n\n1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:47.020\n is not affecting your stress\n\n1:38:47.020 --> 1:38:48.980\n and is actually making you happy\n\n1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:51.940\n or you're drawing some kind of source of happiness\n\n1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:53.100\n and pleasure and satisfaction,\n\n1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:54.900\n like being awake when others aren't.\n\n1:38:54.900 --> 1:38:57.560\n It's like the Mike Tyson thing or something,\n\n1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:00.200\n like training when you've convinced yourself\n\n1:39:00.200 --> 1:39:01.680\n everybody's sleeping and therefore\n\n1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:04.140\n you're somehow training much better.\n\n1:39:04.140 --> 1:39:07.780\n That's powerful even if you look statistically\n\n1:39:07.780 --> 1:39:10.120\n six hours may be worse than eight hours\n\n1:39:10.120 --> 1:39:12.340\n or four hours may be worse than six hours.\n\n1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:14.500\n So the mind is a powerful thing.\n\n1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:16.240\n Super powerful.\n\n1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:18.080\n But if you want to be a super heavyweight.\n\n1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:19.500\n Eat.\n\n1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:23.360\n You got to eat like stupid amounts all the time, yeah.\n\n1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:25.360\n You have to test your digestive system.\n\n1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:26.580\n What's your favorite meal by the way?\n\n1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:29.780\n Just if you had to, you know, your last meal.\n\n1:39:29.780 --> 1:39:34.780\n I am, I do, oh geez, I like so much food, it's tough.\n\n1:39:34.900 --> 1:39:37.740\n But I'd say the food that I rely on a lot\n\n1:39:37.740 --> 1:39:41.020\n when I'm getting ready to compete is sushi.\n\n1:39:41.020 --> 1:39:42.260\n Just because it normally comes in\n\n1:39:42.260 --> 1:39:45.580\n an all you can eat format, you know.\n\n1:39:45.580 --> 1:39:50.580\n So I love to go and just binge all you can eat buffets.\n\n1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:52.460\n Sushi is just super convenient.\n\n1:39:52.460 --> 1:39:53.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:53.740 --> 1:39:56.180\n If I was a sushi all you can eat buffet place\n\n1:39:56.180 --> 1:39:57.780\n I'd be terrified when I saw you.\n\n1:39:58.960 --> 1:40:01.060\n Have you had barbecue at Texas?\n\n1:40:01.060 --> 1:40:03.620\n Yeah, I love it, I love it, yeah.\n\n1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:06.060\n So you, just a small tangent on this.\n\n1:40:06.060 --> 1:40:10.980\n You faced The Mountain for Bjornsson.\n\n1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:12.380\n Well first of all you arm wrestled him.\n\n1:40:12.380 --> 1:40:15.340\n It's interesting to ask, so this is The Mountain\n\n1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:18.580\n from the Game of Thrones, a strong man,\n\n1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:19.980\n one of the strongest people in the world,\n\n1:40:19.980 --> 1:40:22.020\n for a time the strongest person in the world.\n\n1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:24.940\n What was it like, I know sort of you guys\n\n1:40:24.940 --> 1:40:28.500\n maybe weren't going 1,000%, but what's it like?\n\n1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:30.860\n Well he probably wasn't going 1,000%.\n\n1:40:30.860 --> 1:40:31.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:31.940 --> 1:40:34.060\n But like what, it's interesting to think\n\n1:40:34.060 --> 1:40:36.840\n what does that strength feel like?\n\n1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:41.140\n So it's a specialized strength in another sport.\n\n1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:41.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:41.980 --> 1:40:42.880\n What did it feel like?\n\n1:40:42.880 --> 1:40:46.920\n What, how strong was he, what are some kind\n\n1:40:46.920 --> 1:40:50.660\n of deep insights you've drawn from that battle?\n\n1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:55.320\n I feel like if we were to go back 1,000 years\n\n1:40:56.400 --> 1:41:00.400\n and if you give him armor and a two handed sword\n\n1:41:00.400 --> 1:41:04.220\n he will just rip across the landscape.\n\n1:41:04.220 --> 1:41:06.520\n And no one will stop him.\n\n1:41:06.520 --> 1:41:08.120\n So this is the boxing match you came to,\n\n1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:10.820\n but there's also a video of them arm wrestling.\n\n1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:15.280\n Yeah, what a titan though, what a titan.\n\n1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:20.280\n A guy like that, tall, strong, fit, disciplined.\n\n1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:24.160\n I mean he is quite a warrior.\n\n1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:25.960\n 419 pounds?\n\n1:41:25.960 --> 1:41:29.820\n Yeah, yeah, he's incredibly impressive.\n\n1:41:29.820 --> 1:41:34.200\n I really like Hap Thor and I like Eddie Hall too.\n\n1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:38.560\n And I was just so, I'm just so caught up with the drama.\n\n1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:42.880\n Okay, so Eddie Hall and Hap Thor Bjornsson,\n\n1:41:42.880 --> 1:41:46.440\n two of the strongest legendary strongmen that we have.\n\n1:41:48.200 --> 1:41:50.320\n And they were the coolest, they were the top\n\n1:41:50.320 --> 1:41:52.540\n when strongman was really super cool.\n\n1:41:54.540 --> 1:41:56.680\n I don't know all the details,\n\n1:41:56.680 --> 1:41:58.440\n but they legit hit each other.\n\n1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:00.520\n Like legit.\n\n1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:03.200\n So I think it kind of stems, I don't know,\n\n1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:05.480\n like I say, I'm not right there with them,\n\n1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:10.480\n but Eddie won the World's Strongest Man event\n\n1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:13.720\n or something one year and the thing is,\n\n1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.680\n one of those victories where Hap Thor\n\n1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:20.080\n was not accepting of his defeat.\n\n1:42:20.080 --> 1:42:22.000\n Okay, and there was a little bit of back and forth.\n\n1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.120\n And basically from what I understand,\n\n1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:25.060\n they were gonna fight the knight\n\n1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:27.200\n of the World's Strongest Man.\n\n1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:29.160\n And they kind of got pulled apart\n\n1:42:29.160 --> 1:42:33.440\n and this heat between them got translated\n\n1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:35.640\n into a potential boxing match.\n\n1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:37.120\n So it's very real.\n\n1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:38.240\n It's a very real fight.\n\n1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:41.520\n So you have the two strongest dudes on the planet\n\n1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:43.440\n are gonna fight each other.\n\n1:42:43.440 --> 1:42:45.340\n So I've been like, you know,\n\n1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:46.980\n because arm wrestling and strongman,\n\n1:42:46.980 --> 1:42:48.640\n it's kind of similar communities.\n\n1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:50.520\n Who do you got?\n\n1:42:51.920 --> 1:42:53.840\n If you were giving me financial advice\n\n1:42:53.840 --> 1:42:55.320\n in the middle of the fight.\n\n1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:57.760\n I am so bad, I always call it wrong.\n\n1:42:57.760 --> 1:42:59.520\n They're very different.\n\n1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:03.680\n I see Hap Thor as being, you know, more.\n\n1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:06.320\n Eddie Hall slimming down, is that what you mean as well?\n\n1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:08.820\n I see Hap Thor as a bit more regimented,\n\n1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:13.760\n but I see Eddie Hall as like way more barbaric\n\n1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:17.720\n and like, I think he's a little bit more athletic,\n\n1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:21.160\n but Hap Thor is bigger and, you know,\n\n1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:22.880\n they've chosen slightly different paths\n\n1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.280\n to prepare for the match.\n\n1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:27.340\n But what happened was like, they were about to fight\n\n1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:30.040\n and Eddie Hall blew his bicep.\n\n1:43:31.080 --> 1:43:34.280\n So me, I was getting ready for Levan in December.\n\n1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:36.240\n We were supposed to arm wrestle in December,\n\n1:43:36.240 --> 1:43:38.620\n but he's got his movie.\n\n1:43:38.620 --> 1:43:40.660\n And so I was like, okay, I can kind of get away\n\n1:43:40.660 --> 1:43:43.620\n from the sport just a little bit, broaden my base.\n\n1:43:43.620 --> 1:43:47.120\n That happened and I was like, ah, an opportunity.\n\n1:43:47.120 --> 1:43:48.000\n You stepped in.\n\n1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:49.400\n An opportunity to fight.\n\n1:43:49.400 --> 1:43:50.880\n I'm like, I'll do it, so.\n\n1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:54.080\n How much training, you trained a little bit,\n\n1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:56.740\n so can you tell about your own decision to do that?\n\n1:43:56.740 --> 1:43:57.680\n What was the training like?\n\n1:43:57.680 --> 1:43:58.720\n What was the experience like?\n\n1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:00.000\n Oh, it was so much fun.\n\n1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:01.660\n It was so much fun.\n\n1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:05.560\n So basically, I made a funny video\n\n1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:08.680\n and I sent it to the organizers of Core Sports\n\n1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:09.720\n that I would do it.\n\n1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:10.560\n I'm like, I'll do it.\n\n1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:13.840\n I'm sure they got a thousand people who wanted to do it.\n\n1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:16.920\n But I'm like, listen, I'm an old man.\n\n1:44:16.920 --> 1:44:18.960\n Like I'm gimped up like everywhere\n\n1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:20.520\n outside the arm wrestling lanes.\n\n1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:23.600\n I said, but I will 100%.\n\n1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:26.620\n Like if you let me fight them, I'll give it my all.\n\n1:44:26.620 --> 1:44:29.520\n And whatever, they didn't get back to me.\n\n1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:30.600\n They're like, yeah, whatever, okay.\n\n1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:33.500\n So then they call me on a Friday,\n\n1:44:33.500 --> 1:44:37.000\n like five weeks before the event,\n\n1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.960\n and they're like, hey, Devin, were you serious?\n\n1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:41.200\n And I'm like, oh, shit.\n\n1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:46.200\n And I'm like, yes, I was serious.\n\n1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:47.560\n Yeah, I'll do it.\n\n1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.160\n And they're like, okay, they're like,\n\n1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:54.400\n it's down to you and like two other people\n\n1:44:54.400 --> 1:44:56.280\n we'll get back to you in a day or two,\n\n1:44:56.280 --> 1:44:57.440\n but you would do it.\n\n1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:58.280\n And I'm like, okay.\n\n1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:01.200\n So they got back to me on Sunday, like,\n\n1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:03.180\n so right away I'm like skipping rope.\n\n1:45:03.180 --> 1:45:06.560\n And I'm like, and I'm so, I only arm wrestle legs.\n\n1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:07.640\n That's all I do.\n\n1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:10.560\n So what was your, you did some striking training.\n\n1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:14.520\n Yeah, so I went to this guy that he was awesome,\n\n1:45:14.520 --> 1:45:19.520\n Zach, Ben Bushida there, that was it from TriStar.\n\n1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:22.320\n Do you know for us the hobby and that's.\n\n1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:23.920\n And yes, people in the comments,\n\n1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:26.640\n I will interview him on this podcast and people can.\n\n1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:28.280\n He's brilliant, right?\n\n1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:29.680\n He's an incredible guy.\n\n1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:31.400\n So right away, like I had no idea\n\n1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:33.840\n about the fight community across Canada really.\n\n1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:37.240\n And I got like by the fifth message\n\n1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:40.320\n that said you must train with Feras.\n\n1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:42.200\n I was like, okay, called him up.\n\n1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:43.440\n He was incredible right away.\n\n1:45:43.440 --> 1:45:46.080\n He's like, yeah, you can come and we'll just work with you.\n\n1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:50.440\n So I got, I got the call, I called him on like Monday\n\n1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:53.240\n at two oclock by like seven oclock.\n\n1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:56.440\n I had my things packed and I went to Montreal\n\n1:45:56.440 --> 1:46:00.120\n and I spent four weeks in the fighter dorms.\n\n1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:01.240\n Just humbling yourself.\n\n1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:05.000\n Yeah, every day, just getting punched in the face,\n\n1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:10.000\n you know, over and over going for runs with all,\n\n1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:12.080\n like they're all like Olympians and pro fighters\n\n1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:13.920\n living in the dorms, super cool dudes.\n\n1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:15.160\n They were so good to me.\n\n1:46:15.160 --> 1:46:19.160\n Yeah, there's a good video of you and Feras just talking.\n\n1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.560\n Yeah, I don't remember which stage this was,\n\n1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:24.560\n but basically, but you were already beginning\n\n1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:25.400\n to get humbled.\n\n1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:26.640\n Oh man, I knew.\n\n1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:28.600\n I mean, I knew what I was getting into.\n\n1:46:28.600 --> 1:46:31.960\n Like I knew it was, I knew it was gonna be a losing battle,\n\n1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:35.280\n but I felt like the opportunity to fight Thor,\n\n1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:37.080\n like how cool is that?\n\n1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:40.360\n Like I had to say, I had to do it.\n\n1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:45.360\n I loved the process and I learned a lot from doing it.\n\n1:46:46.560 --> 1:46:49.240\n Like the dorms, I wanna do something like that\n\n1:46:49.240 --> 1:46:50.080\n with arm wrestling.\n\n1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:52.480\n I think we're big enough now that we can have these\n\n1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:55.800\n kind of, you know, dorms, frat houses,\n\n1:46:55.800 --> 1:46:56.840\n whatever you wanna call it.\n\n1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:57.880\n What's the dorm like?\n\n1:46:57.880 --> 1:47:00.680\n So you're basically staying there, food's there.\n\n1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:03.720\n So you mentioned, what was the word you used?\n\n1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:04.560\n Administration.\n\n1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:06.240\n Yeah, exactly, that's it.\n\n1:47:06.240 --> 1:47:07.440\n So it removes all of that.\n\n1:47:07.440 --> 1:47:08.440\n Makes it so simple.\n\n1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:09.280\n You can just focus.\n\n1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:12.040\n You know, the gym is here, you live here.\n\n1:47:12.040 --> 1:47:12.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:15.600\n You know, that your life becomes simple.\n\n1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:16.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:18.960\n So there's a guy named Jimmy Pedro here in America.\n\n1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:21.680\n He's a famous coach, has a place up in Boston.\n\n1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:23.240\n He has kind of a dorm like that too.\n\n1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:24.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:28.720\n And that becomes essential when the community is small,\n\n1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:32.720\n but you're trying to do epic things like win an Olympic gold.\n\n1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:33.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:35.920\n So you have to really put the people together\n\n1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:37.760\n in these kind of minimalist conditions\n\n1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:39.280\n where they just focus on the training,\n\n1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:40.480\n focus, focus, focus.\n\n1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:41.320\n Yes.\n\n1:47:42.240 --> 1:47:43.840\n Yeah, it wasn't enough time.\n\n1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:46.760\n I mean, I trained for about three or four weeks,\n\n1:47:47.760 --> 1:47:50.480\n but I loved the journey and...\n\n1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:52.040\n Well, what are some of the fun things you enjoy?\n\n1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:54.320\n So you did mostly striking, did you?\n\n1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:55.160\n Yeah, I guess it was...\n\n1:47:55.160 --> 1:47:56.000\n Yeah, it was boxing.\n\n1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:56.840\n It was straight up boxing.\n\n1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.000\n Boxing, yeah.\n\n1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:59.920\n What are some things that were transferable?\n\n1:47:59.920 --> 1:48:02.320\n What are some cool things you learned from that?\n\n1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:03.760\n So from the world of armwrestling,\n\n1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:05.240\n have you taken anything back?\n\n1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:09.000\n Like some training regimens, ideas about training,\n\n1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.240\n even movements?\n\n1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:17.400\n Because for us it's a unique mind as well for training.\n\n1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:18.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:19.600\n I don't know.\n\n1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:23.880\n I mean, I've gone very far down the path of armwrestling.\n\n1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:27.840\n Boxing and armwrestling are very different.\n\n1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:30.080\n They're very different sports.\n\n1:48:30.080 --> 1:48:35.080\n The physicality required is very different.\n\n1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:39.000\n The mentality, I mean, it's fighting.\n\n1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.120\n So it's another form of fighting, which is cool.\n\n1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.360\n The big things that I took back from it,\n\n1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:47.880\n the things that I loved about it was I had to run again.\n\n1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:51.160\n So really work on endurance.\n\n1:48:51.160 --> 1:48:52.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:54.480\n Yeah, I was going for runs with guys in the dorms\n\n1:48:54.480 --> 1:48:57.920\n and they would just destroy me.\n\n1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:00.920\n Just like it was so bad.\n\n1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:06.280\n How did you feel in the actual boxing\n\n1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:08.400\n in terms of endurance?\n\n1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:09.240\n Were you able to?\n\n1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:10.080\n No.\n\n1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:11.160\n No.\n\n1:49:11.160 --> 1:49:12.000\n It's just torture.\n\n1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000\n It was terrible.\n\n1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.320\n And the thing is it was so crazy for me\n\n1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:19.680\n because I really was good once upon a time.\n\n1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:20.520\n I really was.\n\n1:49:20.520 --> 1:49:24.520\n Like physically, I had incredible full body endurance.\n\n1:49:24.520 --> 1:49:29.520\n But being so specialized, I realized how much I had slipped.\n\n1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:33.560\n And yeah, it was fun to try and regain it.\n\n1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:36.200\n I think it's affected my body composition.\n\n1:49:36.200 --> 1:49:39.200\n I think since that training, I've become much more lean.\n\n1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:42.480\n I think it was a very healthy thing for me to do.\n\n1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:46.080\n Like health wise, I always think that when you're far away\n\n1:49:46.080 --> 1:49:48.920\n from competition, it's really good to kind of spread out.\n\n1:49:48.920 --> 1:49:49.760\n Really good.\n\n1:49:49.760 --> 1:49:51.120\n So I think that in that way.\n\n1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:52.120\n Also for your mind.\n\n1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:52.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:56.880\n Yeah, just like, yeah.\n\n1:49:56.880 --> 1:49:59.560\n Yeah, it's something about clearing your,\n\n1:50:00.720 --> 1:50:02.760\n I think you've talked about this is like\n\n1:50:03.640 --> 1:50:06.360\n you're basically taking steps back\n\n1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:08.000\n before you take steps forward.\n\n1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:08.840\n I forget how you call it.\n\n1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:09.760\n Yeah, the wave.\n\n1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:10.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:10.600 --> 1:50:13.200\n Yeah, under, you know, you have to go under.\n\n1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:14.640\n You got to.\n\n1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:16.280\n You know, if you want to go above the line,\n\n1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:18.560\n you have to spend some time beneath it.\n\n1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:20.280\n And yeah, I was definitely beneath the line\n\n1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:21.120\n for a long time.\n\n1:50:21.120 --> 1:50:22.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:26.840\n But Mountain, I mean, like the interesting thing was\n\n1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:31.840\n as incredible as he is, you know, like what a monster.\n\n1:50:32.880 --> 1:50:37.240\n And I think if you had had him training in boxing,\n\n1:50:37.240 --> 1:50:40.160\n you know, for a long time and like from his youth,\n\n1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:42.920\n I think you, you know, the guy could be world champion,\n\n1:50:42.920 --> 1:50:46.440\n but you know, to be so specialized and then to switch,\n\n1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:47.640\n you're at a disadvantage.\n\n1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:48.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:48.480 --> 1:50:53.480\n And also like I know from just fighting guys in the gym\n\n1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:58.640\n in TriStar, some of those guys were way scarier, for real.\n\n1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:01.920\n Like as scary as Thor is, like there's guys\n\n1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:05.760\n in that TriStar gym that don't look like anything\n\n1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:10.280\n that would murder me much worse, much worse.\n\n1:51:10.280 --> 1:51:12.600\n Yeah, but also, you know, that's the difference\n\n1:51:12.600 --> 1:51:15.040\n between being in the gym and under the lights too.\n\n1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:18.320\n I mean, GSB is an example, George St. Pierre is an example,\n\n1:51:18.320 --> 1:51:21.760\n somebody that maybe doesn't look terrifying.\n\n1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:22.600\n He's at a TriStar.\n\n1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:25.400\n Yep, he trains at TriStar, but he's quite,\n\n1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:29.160\n he's super nice, super humble,\n\n1:51:29.160 --> 1:51:31.240\n but is terrifying when he's fighting.\n\n1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:32.080\n Right.\n\n1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:33.560\n He's dominating people.\n\n1:51:33.560 --> 1:51:38.560\n You mentioned death and your Canadian special forces\n\n1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:42.560\n and in general, thinking about mortality.\n\n1:51:42.560 --> 1:51:44.360\n Do you think about your death?\n\n1:51:44.360 --> 1:51:45.240\n Do you?\n\n1:51:45.240 --> 1:51:46.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:46.080 --> 1:51:49.000\n Do you contemplate the end, that this thing,\n\n1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.640\n that this ride ends?\n\n1:51:50.640 --> 1:51:52.000\n All the time, yeah.\n\n1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:55.400\n From, I've thought about death from a young age.\n\n1:51:55.400 --> 1:51:56.800\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n1:51:56.800 --> 1:51:58.040\n Yeah, I hate it.\n\n1:51:58.040 --> 1:51:59.360\n Yeah, I don't wanna die.\n\n1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:01.440\n Yeah, definitely don't wanna die.\n\n1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:06.120\n But there's times when I can rid myself of it, yeah.\n\n1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:11.120\n But for sure, I mean, I'm not happy that death is inevitable\n\n1:52:11.120 --> 1:52:16.120\n and I'm not happy that potentially it's inevitable\n\n1:52:16.920 --> 1:52:21.920\n for all of us, but it does, I like to fight against it.\n\n1:52:25.400 --> 1:52:28.960\n Does it, if you could be immortal, would you choose to?\n\n1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:30.760\n That's my only wish.\n\n1:52:30.760 --> 1:52:32.240\n Oh, see, but here's the thing.\n\n1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:35.240\n That's, but the point is to have that wish.\n\n1:52:35.240 --> 1:52:40.240\n It's like the all you can eat buffet at sushi.\n\n1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:44.000\n It's, that sushi's more delicious if you have a limit.\n\n1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:44.960\n Do you have a, oh.\n\n1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:47.240\n Well, I don't know.\n\n1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.560\n I mean, I don't think I get sick of stuff.\n\n1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:50.880\n I'm very simple.\n\n1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:52.560\n Yeah, I don't think I would get tired of it.\n\n1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:54.000\n I really don't.\n\n1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.200\n I mean, if someone would pose it to you,\n\n1:52:56.200 --> 1:52:57.760\n do you wanna live forever?\n\n1:52:57.760 --> 1:52:59.360\n You would choose no?\n\n1:52:59.360 --> 1:53:00.440\n Yeah, I would choose no.\n\n1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:01.280\n Choose no.\n\n1:53:01.280 --> 1:53:03.280\n Well, my answer's probably yes.\n\n1:53:04.480 --> 1:53:08.980\n Like, no, I would, it's more like the snooze button.\n\n1:53:08.980 --> 1:53:11.700\n Do you wanna, do you, do you want?\n\n1:53:11.700 --> 1:53:13.820\n Well, you could go to sleep.\n\n1:53:13.820 --> 1:53:16.060\n But it's very difficult in the moment to go to sleep,\n\n1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:20.240\n but if I'm allowed to live forever,\n\n1:53:21.180 --> 1:53:26.180\n I'm going to delay all the crazy,\n\n1:53:26.460 --> 1:53:30.020\n like all the ambitious goals, all the,\n\n1:53:30.020 --> 1:53:31.540\n because, oh, there's always time.\n\n1:53:31.540 --> 1:53:33.380\n That's fine, but there is tomorrow, then.\n\n1:53:33.380 --> 1:53:34.620\n But there is tomorrow, but see,\n\n1:53:34.620 --> 1:53:37.780\n I think that takes away from the richness of,\n\n1:53:37.780 --> 1:53:41.420\n like, the richness of the lived experience\n\n1:53:41.420 --> 1:53:42.740\n of just each moment.\n\n1:53:42.740 --> 1:53:45.100\n I think the richness of each moment\n\n1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:48.420\n comes from saying, like, I could die tonight.\n\n1:53:48.420 --> 1:53:51.900\n Like, that, it tastes delicious because you're gonna die.\n\n1:53:51.900 --> 1:53:54.540\n I'm afraid if you're not,\n\n1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:55.860\n I'm afraid all of that goes away,\n\n1:53:55.860 --> 1:53:58.900\n all of that magic goes away if you can live forever.\n\n1:53:58.900 --> 1:53:59.740\n I don't know.\n\n1:53:59.740 --> 1:54:01.000\n I don't know.\n\n1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:05.180\n But I'll tell you, every time I have a near death experience\n\n1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:06.260\n or think I'm gonna die,\n\n1:54:06.260 --> 1:54:09.140\n I definitely live better afterwards, yeah.\n\n1:54:09.140 --> 1:54:11.540\n Like, it's always been that way.\n\n1:54:11.540 --> 1:54:14.280\n But yeah, no.\n\n1:54:14.280 --> 1:54:15.840\n That's why the Stoics, you know,\n\n1:54:15.840 --> 1:54:19.220\n they really preach contemplating your mortality often.\n\n1:54:19.220 --> 1:54:21.600\n It kind of reminds you.\n\n1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:23.620\n This whole thing could just end any moment\n\n1:54:23.620 --> 1:54:25.900\n and it makes you really appreciate.\n\n1:54:25.900 --> 1:54:27.860\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n1:54:27.860 --> 1:54:29.020\n I don't know.\n\n1:54:29.020 --> 1:54:34.020\n Certainly improving the quality of life is important.\n\n1:54:34.020 --> 1:54:39.020\n But part of me thinks that immortality\n\n1:54:39.340 --> 1:54:43.540\n is not as fun as we would like to imagine.\n\n1:54:43.540 --> 1:54:45.800\n Do you think that maybe you're,\n\n1:54:46.820 --> 1:54:50.140\n in what you're building potentially is immortal?\n\n1:54:50.140 --> 1:54:54.620\n Well, that's what I definitely think about with robots.\n\n1:54:56.820 --> 1:55:00.060\n If they were to have a humanlike experience\n\n1:55:00.060 --> 1:55:01.700\n and be able to interact with humans\n\n1:55:01.700 --> 1:55:03.460\n in a deep, meaningful way,\n\n1:55:03.460 --> 1:55:05.580\n I think they too have to be mortal\n\n1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.400\n in some fundamental way that means mortal.\n\n1:55:08.400 --> 1:55:10.960\n Like, their ride has to end as well.\n\n1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:15.280\n Because they won't be able to interact with humans deeply\n\n1:55:15.280 --> 1:55:17.020\n unless that's the case.\n\n1:55:18.340 --> 1:55:23.340\n Like, to have fear, to have love,\n\n1:55:25.180 --> 1:55:28.720\n the ability to suffer, the ability to miss somebody,\n\n1:55:29.740 --> 1:55:32.820\n I think scarcity is important.\n\n1:55:32.820 --> 1:55:36.660\n You have to be able to truly lose somebody.\n\n1:55:36.660 --> 1:55:38.460\n You have to be, to fear things,\n\n1:55:38.460 --> 1:55:43.180\n you have to truly have the risk of destroying yourself.\n\n1:55:43.180 --> 1:55:46.420\n And to have a sense of what it means to be a self,\n\n1:55:47.740 --> 1:55:51.100\n you have to be able to lose it.\n\n1:55:51.100 --> 1:55:53.940\n So if you're immortal, you're just going to be,\n\n1:55:53.940 --> 1:55:58.020\n I feel like you're going to be like a toaster,\n\n1:55:58.020 --> 1:56:00.740\n an intelligent toaster that just serves.\n\n1:56:00.740 --> 1:56:03.140\n There's such a negative perspective on it.\n\n1:56:03.140 --> 1:56:04.060\n And then mortality?\n\n1:56:04.060 --> 1:56:05.980\n Yeah, just think, well, now you just,\n\n1:56:05.980 --> 1:56:08.480\n you can get all those things done that you want to do.\n\n1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:10.720\n I hope you're right, I hope you're right.\n\n1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:14.260\n Yeah, I mean, potentially, you could invest even harder\n\n1:56:14.260 --> 1:56:16.060\n because you're like, wow, I'm actually going to be able\n\n1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:17.500\n to get all this stuff done.\n\n1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:20.600\n I think about this a lot, I hope you're right,\n\n1:56:20.600 --> 1:56:25.220\n but I fear that the drive to create,\n\n1:56:25.220 --> 1:56:28.140\n I can even do more, all of that dissipates,\n\n1:56:28.140 --> 1:56:31.380\n disappears if you have all the time in the world.\n\n1:56:31.380 --> 1:56:33.500\n I just know how lazy I am.\n\n1:56:33.500 --> 1:56:35.260\n And if I have all the time in the world,\n\n1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:39.160\n I'm just going to sit there and just watch\n\n1:56:39.160 --> 1:56:43.380\n the stupidest YouTube videos for the rest of all eternity.\n\n1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:46.340\n Now, eternity's a long time.\n\n1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:50.420\n Eat Doritos and Cheetos and just get fatter and fatter.\n\n1:56:50.420 --> 1:56:53.660\n I can get in shape later, there's always time.\n\n1:56:53.660 --> 1:56:56.140\n That's like a long period of contemplation.\n\n1:56:56.140 --> 1:56:59.540\n Yeah, so for the first 1,000 years,\n\n1:56:59.540 --> 1:57:02.580\n it'll be the Dorito period of the Lex life.\n\n1:57:02.580 --> 1:57:06.620\n Yeah, you could be like Jabba the Hutt for 1,000 years.\n\n1:57:06.620 --> 1:57:09.140\n You mentioned aliens, very important topic.\n\n1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:11.300\n Do you actually think about this\n\n1:57:11.300 --> 1:57:13.900\n has been an increased interest,\n\n1:57:13.900 --> 1:57:18.380\n and there's been increased UFO sightings and encounters,\n\n1:57:18.380 --> 1:57:20.840\n all that kind of stuff, the US government at least\n\n1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:25.840\n releasing data, releasing videos of pilots,\n\n1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:30.220\n pilot observations, and from airplanes of UFOs.\n\n1:57:30.220 --> 1:57:31.900\n Do you think about this kind of stuff?\n\n1:57:31.900 --> 1:57:33.940\n Because you mentioned in the following context,\n\n1:57:33.940 --> 1:57:36.780\n you mentioned like us humans will get our shit together\n\n1:57:37.660 --> 1:57:39.380\n when the aliens eventually come.\n\n1:57:42.140 --> 1:57:43.860\n What do you make of all the sightings?\n\n1:57:43.860 --> 1:57:45.780\n Is that something you think about?\n\n1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:47.940\n I thought about it a lot when I was younger,\n\n1:57:47.940 --> 1:57:50.820\n and I've just, I made my conclusions,\n\n1:57:50.820 --> 1:57:54.180\n and yeah, I don't think that there's a possibility\n\n1:57:54.180 --> 1:57:55.420\n that there aren't aliens.\n\n1:57:55.420 --> 1:57:57.180\n I would think that it would be impossible\n\n1:57:57.180 --> 1:57:58.580\n for there not to be aliens.\n\n1:58:01.620 --> 1:58:03.900\n I feel like this is pretty good real estate,\n\n1:58:03.900 --> 1:58:07.220\n so you'd probably want it,\n\n1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:10.180\n but we already might be, well, I don't even think might.\n\n1:58:10.180 --> 1:58:11.700\n I mean, it's probably quite likely\n\n1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:13.660\n that we are to some degree aliens.\n\n1:58:13.660 --> 1:58:16.900\n I mean, all life is probably to some degree alien.\n\n1:58:16.900 --> 1:58:18.940\n I like the real estate, so the resources,\n\n1:58:18.940 --> 1:58:21.340\n but we're also kind of interesting.\n\n1:58:21.340 --> 1:58:24.220\n Whatever this ant colony of living organisms\n\n1:58:24.220 --> 1:58:27.180\n that we've created, it's kind of interesting to study.\n\n1:58:27.180 --> 1:58:29.580\n I tend to believe that the alien civilizations\n\n1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:33.700\n that are going to reach us or have reached us\n\n1:58:33.700 --> 1:58:35.240\n are far more intelligent,\n\n1:58:36.440 --> 1:58:39.220\n just orders of magnitude more intelligent than us,\n\n1:58:39.220 --> 1:58:41.940\n and so it's going to be very difficult both ways, actually,\n\n1:58:41.940 --> 1:58:44.720\n for us to understand them and for them\n\n1:58:44.720 --> 1:58:47.540\n to dumb themselves down enough to understand us.\n\n1:58:47.540 --> 1:58:48.380\n Yeah, probably.\n\n1:58:48.380 --> 1:58:52.980\n So they might even just miss our existence altogether\n\n1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:56.140\n just because I tend to believe,\n\n1:58:56.140 --> 1:58:57.060\n I don't know what you think,\n\n1:58:57.060 --> 1:58:59.320\n that we're not that special\n\n1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:02.820\n in terms of all the life forms in the universe.\n\n1:59:02.820 --> 1:59:04.980\n There's a lot of cool stuff out there.\n\n1:59:04.980 --> 1:59:06.900\n Has to be, has to be.\n\n1:59:06.900 --> 1:59:08.500\n But to us, we're special.\n\n1:59:08.500 --> 1:59:11.380\n Yeah, well, that's all that matters, right?\n\n1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:14.700\n Even the human species is the most special to us humans.\n\n1:59:14.700 --> 1:59:18.380\n There could be much more special species here on Earth\n\n1:59:18.380 --> 1:59:20.180\n they were just totally oblivious to,\n\n1:59:20.180 --> 1:59:23.140\n like trees on a scale of thousands of years.\n\n1:59:23.140 --> 1:59:25.600\n Maybe they're onto something.\n\n1:59:26.660 --> 1:59:27.800\n Lex, you know,\n\n1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:34.900\n I think that so much of what makes a person special\n\n1:59:34.900 --> 1:59:37.380\n is what they pass on, your kids.\n\n1:59:37.380 --> 1:59:39.780\n But I think that you are quite special\n\n1:59:39.780 --> 1:59:42.440\n because you're part of this thing\n\n1:59:42.440 --> 1:59:45.740\n that's potentially giving birth to the next thing.\n\n1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:48.580\n The robots.\n\n1:59:48.580 --> 1:59:49.420\n The robots.\n\n1:59:49.420 --> 1:59:50.960\n I should say, the funny thing is,\n\n1:59:50.960 --> 1:59:53.860\n while talking to Devon during this podcast,\n\n1:59:53.860 --> 1:59:57.580\n I had a doorbell ring, had to go downstairs,\n\n1:59:57.580 --> 1:59:59.960\n and there was a big box,\n\n2:00:01.540 --> 2:00:04.420\n medicine box with a new legged robot.\n\n2:00:04.420 --> 2:00:07.580\n So the hilarity of you saying that is,\n\n2:00:07.580 --> 2:00:11.100\n because that robot is actually going to likely be\n\n2:00:11.100 --> 2:00:15.900\n the main robot that I show to the world in the coming months\n\n2:00:15.900 --> 2:00:17.580\n because that has the,\n\n2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.980\n that's the highest compute level in that robot.\n\n2:00:19.980 --> 2:00:22.700\n So I've been playing a lot with legged robots,\n\n2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:26.640\n the four legs, so like a dog.\n\n2:00:28.980 --> 2:00:30.380\n I like all the robots,\n\n2:00:30.380 --> 2:00:33.540\n but there's something about when a robot has legs,\n\n2:00:33.540 --> 2:00:34.920\n it's able to communicate,\n\n2:00:36.020 --> 2:00:38.320\n it's able to connect with humans in some kind of deep way,\n\n2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:40.900\n in the way a dog can, just show affection.\n\n2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:43.740\n Something about like, step, step, step, step,\n\n2:00:43.740 --> 2:00:46.220\n and then the robot realizes you're here,\n\n2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:48.500\n and then it steps and then notices you\n\n2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:51.340\n in the way the dog does and raises its head.\n\n2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:56.500\n It makes me feel noticed and heard\n\n2:00:56.500 --> 2:00:59.740\n in the same way I do when a dog notices me.\n\n2:00:59.740 --> 2:01:02.500\n That excitement, that stupid excitement of like,\n\n2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.700\n yes, fellow living organism.\n\n2:01:05.700 --> 2:01:09.340\n And what excites me about legged robots\n\n2:01:09.340 --> 2:01:13.260\n is that holy shit, it's possible to engineer this.\n\n2:01:13.260 --> 2:01:15.460\n It's possible to create that feeling,\n\n2:01:15.460 --> 2:01:17.220\n and I wonder where that can go.\n\n2:01:17.220 --> 2:01:20.280\n There's a lot of negative possible trajectories,\n\n2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:23.060\n but I have a sense that there's positive ones too.\n\n2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:23.900\n Adding more love to the world.\n\n2:01:23.900 --> 2:01:25.900\n You think that they'll take us with them?\n\n2:01:27.420 --> 2:01:29.940\n Yeah, I think so because I,\n\n2:01:29.940 --> 2:01:33.140\n so there's this fear of robots\n\n2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:34.880\n that they become super intelligent\n\n2:01:34.880 --> 2:01:36.200\n and run away from us humans,\n\n2:01:36.200 --> 2:01:38.860\n and basically become so intelligent\n\n2:01:38.860 --> 2:01:43.400\n and then they almost just not giving a damn will destroy us.\n\n2:01:44.540 --> 2:01:48.180\n But I think in order for robots to become intelligent,\n\n2:01:48.180 --> 2:01:51.300\n they have to integrate themselves with society.\n\n2:01:51.300 --> 2:01:56.300\n So they, by the very nature of how they become intelligent,\n\n2:01:57.160 --> 2:01:58.940\n have to bring us along.\n\n2:01:58.940 --> 2:02:02.620\n So it's not that there'll be this separate thing.\n\n2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:05.900\n They have to, like, we'll have robots in the home.\n\n2:02:05.900 --> 2:02:07.420\n Well, they'll be interacting with us.\n\n2:02:07.420 --> 2:02:10.700\n You have human kids, and you have a bunch of robots.\n\n2:02:10.700 --> 2:02:11.740\n You have robot friends.\n\n2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:12.900\n You have human friends,\n\n2:02:12.900 --> 2:02:16.340\n and the robots make your human to human relationships\n\n2:02:16.340 --> 2:02:18.160\n much more meaningful and richer.\n\n2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:20.980\n They bring more love to the world, but it's integrated.\n\n2:02:20.980 --> 2:02:24.420\n It's not like they'll be developing smarter and smarter\n\n2:02:26.300 --> 2:02:30.420\n as, like, sentient beings by themselves.\n\n2:02:30.420 --> 2:02:32.380\n I think that's very difficult to do.\n\n2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:34.500\n You have to be doing that together with humans,\n\n2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:35.860\n and so we'll come for the ride.\n\n2:02:35.860 --> 2:02:37.940\n There's technical things, like,\n\n2:02:37.940 --> 2:02:41.500\n we might merge, like, cyborgs more and more.\n\n2:02:41.500 --> 2:02:43.380\n Well, we already saw our cyborgs, right?\n\n2:02:43.380 --> 2:02:46.420\n With the phones and so on, but more and more.\n\n2:02:46.420 --> 2:02:50.860\n So with Elon and Neuralink, deeper integration of robots\n\n2:02:50.860 --> 2:02:55.380\n and AI into, like, increasing the bandwidth\n\n2:02:55.380 --> 2:02:56.920\n at which they can communicate.\n\n2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.700\n So if we do implants in the brain,\n\n2:03:00.820 --> 2:03:04.580\n I think, again, a lot of people are really nervous\n\n2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:07.620\n about this, as am I, but I think there's a lot\n\n2:03:07.620 --> 2:03:09.620\n of trajectories that are positive there.\n\n2:03:10.780 --> 2:03:12.500\n That, to me, is exciting, and also,\n\n2:03:12.500 --> 2:03:15.320\n I just don't think it's possible to stop this development,\n\n2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:18.060\n so we should steer it.\n\n2:03:18.060 --> 2:03:20.020\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:20.860\n For good.\n\n2:03:20.860 --> 2:03:22.460\n Did you, I mean, you must have watched\n\n2:03:22.460 --> 2:03:23.660\n the movie Terminator, right?\n\n2:03:23.660 --> 2:03:25.240\n Yeah, of course, I love Terminator.\n\n2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:28.740\n Yeah, it's probably my favorite movie of all time.\n\n2:03:28.740 --> 2:03:35.260\n Yeah, yeah, I mean, that's the big fear, right?\n\n2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:37.060\n Yeah, what's the conclusion with Terminator?\n\n2:03:37.060 --> 2:03:39.280\n Isn't ultimately humanity wins?\n\n2:03:39.280 --> 2:03:41.200\n I think they're at, like, Terminator 8 now.\n\n2:03:41.200 --> 2:03:42.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:42.040 --> 2:03:44.580\n You know, I don't know.\n\n2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:48.280\n Yeah, and it's interesting, actually,\n\n2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:50.200\n I was gonna bring this up as you were talking about it,\n\n2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:54.460\n but China and the United States actually don't know\n\n2:03:54.460 --> 2:03:59.220\n where Canada is on this, but they both have agreed\n\n2:03:59.220 --> 2:04:00.820\n that they're not going to put limits\n\n2:04:00.820 --> 2:04:04.540\n on autonomous weapon system development.\n\n2:04:04.540 --> 2:04:05.380\n They're not going to.\n\n2:04:05.380 --> 2:04:06.620\n They're not going to.\n\n2:04:06.620 --> 2:04:08.500\n So, because China said we're not going to,\n\n2:04:08.500 --> 2:04:12.820\n and now US officially announced that we're not, we can't.\n\n2:04:12.820 --> 2:04:16.940\n Well, you can't, it's like, you never could, right?\n\n2:04:16.940 --> 2:04:20.780\n As soon as it exists and it's better, people will use it.\n\n2:04:20.780 --> 2:04:26.540\n Well, but you, there's been a global ban on bioweapons.\n\n2:04:26.540 --> 2:04:28.820\n So, you were able to come to an agreement there\n\n2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:32.340\n that we're not going to use biological weapons in war.\n\n2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:34.980\n So, it was, a lot of people are really upset\n\n2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:39.540\n that in the case of AI driven weapons,\n\n2:04:39.540 --> 2:04:42.220\n the world said, nope, that's okay.\n\n2:04:42.220 --> 2:04:45.140\n And so, now you have this potential\n\n2:04:45.140 --> 2:04:48.100\n for greater and greater automation in drones,\n\n2:04:48.100 --> 2:04:51.380\n for example, in picking bombing locations.\n\n2:04:51.380 --> 2:04:54.540\n And so, the area at which they attack.\n\n2:04:54.540 --> 2:04:57.540\n And so, you get, some of that stuff that you mentioned\n\n2:04:57.540 --> 2:05:03.420\n that drew you to the military is that teamwork\n\n2:05:03.420 --> 2:05:05.860\n between humans, that decision making.\n\n2:05:05.860 --> 2:05:10.220\n So, there's strategy, but built into that team\n\n2:05:10.220 --> 2:05:12.740\n is a deep humanity.\n\n2:05:12.740 --> 2:05:17.620\n Like, even when there's an enemy, there's lines\n\n2:05:17.620 --> 2:05:20.740\n that you're aware of, of what is ethical, what is not,\n\n2:05:20.740 --> 2:05:23.060\n what is just and what is not.\n\n2:05:23.060 --> 2:05:29.900\n And it's so easy for a machine to miss all of that,\n\n2:05:29.900 --> 2:05:33.260\n plow through it and do deeply inhumane acts,\n\n2:05:33.260 --> 2:05:34.820\n commit atrocities.\n\n2:05:34.820 --> 2:05:38.740\n That's something that worries a lot of people.\n\n2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:41.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:45.820\n Because, yeah, an AI based war is just, it's terrifying.\n\n2:05:45.820 --> 2:05:48.380\n Especially with cyber security, which is becoming\n\n2:05:48.380 --> 2:05:51.020\n more and more of an issue, which is hacking.\n\n2:05:51.020 --> 2:05:51.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:51.900 --> 2:05:56.900\n Sort of people that look a lot like me\n\n2:05:57.580 --> 2:05:59.580\n being the warriors of the future.\n\n2:05:59.580 --> 2:06:00.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:00.420 --> 2:06:03.420\n Which is meaning people behind a keyboard\n\n2:06:03.420 --> 2:06:07.460\n versus the traditional warriors.\n\n2:06:08.340 --> 2:06:09.460\n Probably inevitable.\n\n2:06:11.180 --> 2:06:12.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:12.100 --> 2:06:13.020\n And terrifying.\n\n2:06:13.020 --> 2:06:14.660\n It is, it is.\n\n2:06:14.660 --> 2:06:18.020\n But I think if you believe that it's possible,\n\n2:06:18.020 --> 2:06:19.540\n it's certainly gonna happen.\n\n2:06:19.540 --> 2:06:22.460\n Like, at some point, it's just when, right?\n\n2:06:22.460 --> 2:06:24.380\n When does it happen?\n\n2:06:24.380 --> 2:06:28.340\n So that, I mean, to me, I'm ultimately optimistic\n\n2:06:28.340 --> 2:06:29.180\n about the future.\n\n2:06:29.180 --> 2:06:31.700\n And to me, I'm excited about the world with AI.\n\n2:06:31.700 --> 2:06:34.980\n I'm even excited about the metaverse\n\n2:06:34.980 --> 2:06:37.620\n and all these kinds of things, living more and more\n\n2:06:37.620 --> 2:06:39.980\n in the digital space, in the virtual reality.\n\n2:06:40.940 --> 2:06:43.300\n I think, so it's a part of me that grew up\n\n2:06:43.300 --> 2:06:45.540\n in the noninternet world, noncomputer world.\n\n2:06:46.780 --> 2:06:49.740\n It says, oh, kids these days with their video games.\n\n2:06:49.740 --> 2:06:52.340\n There's part of me that's like that.\n\n2:06:52.340 --> 2:06:56.980\n But I think technology at its best\n\n2:06:56.980 --> 2:06:59.900\n can bring out the best of humanity.\n\n2:06:59.900 --> 2:07:03.180\n And so I think virtual reality, all of these things,\n\n2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:06.780\n over time, we'll figure out how to fix it\n\n2:07:06.780 --> 2:07:08.140\n to bring out the humanity.\n\n2:07:08.140 --> 2:07:12.140\n Social networks, the first generation social networks,\n\n2:07:12.140 --> 2:07:13.660\n now Facebook, Twitter, and so on,\n\n2:07:13.660 --> 2:07:15.020\n they have so many problems.\n\n2:07:15.020 --> 2:07:17.140\n They're bringing out the worst in people.\n\n2:07:17.140 --> 2:07:18.620\n But I think we're learning from that.\n\n2:07:18.620 --> 2:07:20.620\n And I think the next generation of social networks\n\n2:07:20.620 --> 2:07:22.380\n will be better and better and better.\n\n2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:26.020\n And so I'm optimistic.\n\n2:07:26.020 --> 2:07:30.940\n But of course, one reason we may have not seen aliens yet,\n\n2:07:30.940 --> 2:07:34.180\n obviously, like in a way that's obvious,\n\n2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:36.980\n is because once you get clever and smart\n\n2:07:36.980 --> 2:07:40.220\n and have all this cool technology, you destroy yourself.\n\n2:07:40.220 --> 2:07:42.980\n And we sure as humans are pretty close to that.\n\n2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:45.060\n Yeah, yeah, there might be that limit\n\n2:07:45.060 --> 2:07:46.940\n that is hard to get right.\n\n2:07:46.940 --> 2:07:49.500\n I'm hoping we get all our aggression between nations\n\n2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:52.380\n out through arm wrestling competition.\n\n2:07:52.380 --> 2:07:53.340\n Right?\n\n2:07:53.340 --> 2:07:54.740\n Just all of that life.\n\n2:07:54.740 --> 2:07:56.580\n Oh my God, wouldn't that be great\n\n2:07:56.580 --> 2:07:59.460\n if it was that simple, yeah.\n\n2:07:59.460 --> 2:08:00.380\n Do you know if there's another\n\n2:08:00.380 --> 2:08:02.260\n over the top type movie to be made?\n\n2:08:02.260 --> 2:08:04.820\n Oh yeah, yeah, there's always stuff in the works.\n\n2:08:04.820 --> 2:08:07.220\n There's actually a, there's a tournament called\n\n2:08:07.220 --> 2:08:09.900\n Over the Top in Australia that's a couple months away.\n\n2:08:09.900 --> 2:08:11.720\n I think they're doing an all the over the top scene.\n\n2:08:11.720 --> 2:08:13.940\n But there are arm wrestling movies\n\n2:08:13.940 --> 2:08:14.980\n that are being made right now.\n\n2:08:14.980 --> 2:08:17.900\n Actually, there's a documentary that's filming me\n\n2:08:17.900 --> 2:08:19.620\n for this whole Levan thing.\n\n2:08:19.620 --> 2:08:23.900\n But yeah, we're probably due for another big one, yeah.\n\n2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:26.340\n But you're also, just with your YouTube channel,\n\n2:08:26.340 --> 2:08:27.540\n you're doing a lot for the sport.\n\n2:08:27.540 --> 2:08:28.540\n That's really cool to see.\n\n2:08:28.540 --> 2:08:31.400\n Just being genuine, but just being like,\n\n2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:34.580\n looking not like you're looking today, but just like.\n\n2:08:34.580 --> 2:08:35.420\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:08:35.420 --> 2:08:36.340\n Just a beard.\n\n2:08:36.340 --> 2:08:37.180\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, normally a mess.\n\n2:08:37.180 --> 2:08:39.300\n Just like sleepy.\n\n2:08:39.300 --> 2:08:41.700\n You know, and just putting yourself out there\n\n2:08:41.700 --> 2:08:42.860\n completely as you are.\n\n2:08:42.860 --> 2:08:44.260\n That's a beautiful thing.\n\n2:08:44.260 --> 2:08:45.460\n The best thing about the sport\n\n2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:47.080\n is it brings people together.\n\n2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:47.920\n That's it.\n\n2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:50.200\n Yeah, the community, the folks I got to interact with,\n\n2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:54.280\n just so awesome, so excited, so full of kindness.\n\n2:08:54.280 --> 2:08:55.900\n I'm definitely gonna find the club here\n\n2:08:55.900 --> 2:09:00.900\n and start working on my arm wrestling game.\n\n2:09:02.180 --> 2:09:03.900\n Devin, this is such a huge honor\n\n2:09:03.900 --> 2:09:07.220\n that you would spend your valuable time.\n\n2:09:07.220 --> 2:09:09.020\n You would come down to Austin.\n\n2:09:09.020 --> 2:09:14.020\n You would hang out with me and do this conversation.\n\n2:09:14.220 --> 2:09:16.140\n Super cool to talk to you, Lex, yeah.\n\n2:09:16.140 --> 2:09:18.260\n As I mentioned, in case people,\n\n2:09:18.260 --> 2:09:20.940\n you know, people I'm sure will tell me.\n\n2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:23.420\n So I hang out with Joe Rogan all the time.\n\n2:09:23.420 --> 2:09:24.420\n He's a friend.\n\n2:09:24.420 --> 2:09:26.020\n I told him that he should talk to Devin.\n\n2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:29.140\n He's going through some stuff currently, you know.\n\n2:09:29.140 --> 2:09:31.220\n But I'm sure, I hope the conversation\n\n2:09:31.220 --> 2:09:34.020\n between you, Devin, and Joe happens eventually.\n\n2:09:34.020 --> 2:09:36.980\n He's, that would be epic as well,\n\n2:09:36.980 --> 2:09:39.820\n because he's a, yeah, he loves fighting.\n\n2:09:39.820 --> 2:09:43.420\n He loves fighting, he loves wrestling, he loves strength.\n\n2:09:43.420 --> 2:09:47.500\n And I think all of those are, like,\n\n2:09:47.500 --> 2:09:51.020\n so perfectly encapsulated in the sport of arm wrestling.\n\n2:09:51.020 --> 2:09:52.660\n So thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n2:09:52.660 --> 2:09:53.760\n Thanks so much, Lex.\n\n2:09:55.820 --> 2:09:58.660\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Devin Larratt.\n\n2:09:58.660 --> 2:10:00.000\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.860\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:07.700\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Miyamoto Musashi.\n\n2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:11.900\n The only reason a warrior is alive is to fight.\n\n2:10:11.900 --> 2:10:15.460\n And the only reason a warrior fights is to win.\n\n2:10:15.460 --> 2:10:35.460\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
