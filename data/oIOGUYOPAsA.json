--> 00:08.180\n at Stanford University.\n\n00:08.180 --> 00:11.400\n Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns\n\n00:11.400 --> 00:14.380\n and the blinding, destructive effects of arrogance\n\n00:14.380 --> 00:19.380\n on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.\n\n00:19.820 --> 00:21.780\n Jay Bhattacharya is the coauthor\n\n00:21.780 --> 00:24.460\n of the now famous Great Barrington Declaration,\n\n00:24.460 --> 00:27.860\n a one page document that in October 2020\n\n00:27.860 --> 00:32.000\n made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:33.600\n Most of this podcast conversation\n\n00:33.600 --> 00:36.360\n is about the ideas related to this document.\n\n00:36.360 --> 00:40.240\n And so let me say a few things here about what troubles me.\n\n00:41.580 --> 00:44.480\n Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy\n\n00:44.480 --> 00:47.340\n often ignore the quiet suffering of millions\n\n00:47.340 --> 00:50.180\n that it results in, which includes economic pain,\n\n00:50.180 --> 00:52.580\n loss of jobs that give meaning and pride\n\n00:52.580 --> 00:55.760\n in the face of uncertainty, the increase in suicide\n\n00:55.760 --> 00:58.560\n and suicidal ideation, and in general,\n\n00:58.560 --> 01:02.360\n the fear and anger that arises from the powerlessness\n\n01:02.360 --> 01:04.200\n forced onto the populace\n\n01:04.200 --> 01:07.060\n by the self proclaimed elites and experts.\n\n01:08.140 --> 01:11.600\n Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns\n\n01:11.600 --> 01:14.040\n talk down to the masses about which path forward\n\n01:14.040 --> 01:16.600\n is right and which is wrong.\n\n01:16.600 --> 01:20.040\n What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy\n\n01:20.040 --> 01:22.880\n among the policymakers for the common man\n\n01:22.880 --> 01:26.280\n and in general for people unlike themselves.\n\n01:26.280 --> 01:28.580\n The landscape of suffering is vast\n\n01:28.580 --> 01:30.220\n and must be fully considered\n\n01:30.220 --> 01:33.220\n in calculating the response to the pandemic\n\n01:33.220 --> 01:36.300\n with humility and with rigorous,\n\n01:36.300 --> 01:39.300\n open minded scientific debate.\n\n01:39.300 --> 01:42.100\n Jay and I talk about the email from Francis Collins\n\n01:42.100 --> 01:46.440\n to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two coauthors\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:49.640\n fringe epidemiologists and also called\n\n01:49.640 --> 01:53.240\n for a devastating published take down of their ideas.\n\n01:53.240 --> 01:57.140\n These words from Francis broke my heart.\n\n01:57.140 --> 02:00.760\n I understand them, I can even steel man them,\n\n02:00.760 --> 02:02.960\n but nevertheless, on balance,\n\n02:02.960 --> 02:06.720\n they show to me a failure of leadership.\n\n02:06.720 --> 02:09.100\n Leadership in a pandemic is hard,\n\n02:09.100 --> 02:12.660\n which is why great leaders are remembered by history.\n\n02:12.660 --> 02:17.660\n They are rare, they stand out and they give me hope.\n\n02:17.660 --> 02:21.620\n Also, this whole mess inspires me\n\n02:21.620 --> 02:24.700\n on my small individual level to do the right thing\n\n02:24.700 --> 02:28.240\n in the face of conformity, despite the long odds.\n\n02:29.500 --> 02:31.460\n I talked to Francis Collins,\n\n02:31.460 --> 02:34.200\n I talked to Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO.\n\n02:34.200 --> 02:36.580\n I also talked and will continue to talk\n\n02:36.580 --> 02:39.840\n with people like Jay and other dissenting voices\n\n02:39.840 --> 02:42.040\n that challenge the mainstream narratives\n\n02:42.040 --> 02:43.820\n and those in the seats of power.\n\n02:43.820 --> 02:46.900\n I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses\n\n02:46.900 --> 02:49.660\n in their ideas with respect and empathy,\n\n02:49.660 --> 02:52.240\n but also with guts and skill.\n\n02:53.200 --> 02:56.840\n The skill part, I hope to improve on over time.\n\n02:56.840 --> 02:59.780\n And I do believe that conversation\n\n02:59.780 --> 03:02.520\n and an open mind is the way out of this.\n\n03:03.480 --> 03:06.020\n And finally, as I've said in the past,\n\n03:06.020 --> 03:10.420\n I value love and integrity far, far above money,\n\n03:10.420 --> 03:12.020\n fame and power.\n\n03:12.020 --> 03:15.120\n Those latter three are all ephemeral.\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:17.000\n They slip through the fingers of anyone\n\n03:17.000 --> 03:19.960\n who tries to hold on and leave behind\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:22.460\n an empty shell of a human being.\n\n03:23.460 --> 03:26.240\n I prefer to die a man who lived by principles\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:28.700\n that nobody could shake and a man\n\n03:28.700 --> 03:30.800\n who added a bit of love to the world.\n\n03:31.880 --> 03:33.980\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n03:33.980 --> 03:36.440\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n03:36.440 --> 03:37.640\n in the description.\n\n03:37.640 --> 03:42.180\n And now, here's my conversation with Jay Bhattacharya.\n\n03:43.860 --> 03:48.460\n To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID?\n\n03:48.460 --> 03:52.660\n Do we have a good measure for this very question?\n\n03:52.660 --> 03:56.100\n So the best evidence for COVID, the deadliness of COVID,\n\n03:56.100 --> 04:00.040\n comes from a whole series of seroprevalence studies.\n\n04:00.040 --> 04:01.540\n Seroprevalence studies are these studies\n\n04:01.540 --> 04:04.800\n of antibody prevalence in the population at large.\n\n04:04.800 --> 04:08.940\n I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies,\n\n04:08.940 --> 04:10.940\n one in Santa Clara County, one in L.A. County,\n\n04:10.940 --> 04:14.240\n and one with Major League Baseball around the U.S.\n\n04:14.240 --> 04:16.140\n If I may just pause you for a second.\n\n04:17.180 --> 04:20.720\n If people don't know what serology is and seroprevalence,\n\n04:20.720 --> 04:23.080\n it does sound like you say zero prevalence.\n\n04:23.080 --> 04:26.020\n It's not, it's sero and serology is antibodies.\n\n04:26.020 --> 04:29.920\n So it's a survey that counts the number of antibodies.\n\n04:29.920 --> 04:31.220\n Specific to COVID, yes.\n\n04:31.220 --> 04:34.900\n People that have antibodies specific to COVID,\n\n04:34.900 --> 04:37.060\n which perhaps shows an indication\n\n04:37.060 --> 04:39.160\n that they likely have had COVID,\n\n04:39.160 --> 04:41.700\n and therefore this is a way to study\n\n04:41.700 --> 04:43.160\n how many people in the population\n\n04:43.160 --> 04:45.440\n have been exposed to or have had COVID.\n\n04:45.440 --> 04:46.840\n Exactly, yeah, exactly.\n\n04:46.840 --> 04:51.840\n So the idea is that we don't know\n\n04:51.840 --> 04:53.520\n exactly the number of people with COVID\n\n04:53.520 --> 04:54.920\n just by counting the people\n\n04:54.920 --> 04:57.780\n that present themselves with symptoms of COVID.\n\n04:57.780 --> 05:01.760\n COVID has, it turns out, a very wide range of symptoms,\n\n05:01.760 --> 05:04.160\n ranging from no symptoms at all\n\n05:04.160 --> 05:05.920\n to this deadly viral pneumonia\n\n05:05.920 --> 05:07.500\n that has killed so many people.\n\n05:07.500 --> 05:10.460\n And the problem is, if you just count the number of cases,\n\n05:10.460 --> 05:12.340\n the people who have very few symptoms\n\n05:12.340 --> 05:15.040\n often don't show up for testing.\n\n05:15.040 --> 05:18.200\n They're outside of the can of public health.\n\n05:18.200 --> 05:21.980\n And so it's really hard to know the answer to your question\n\n05:21.980 --> 05:24.240\n without understanding how many people are infected,\n\n05:24.240 --> 05:26.380\n because you can probably tell the number of deaths,\n\n05:26.380 --> 05:28.320\n even though there's some controversy over that.\n\n05:28.320 --> 05:31.320\n But that, so the numerator is possible,\n\n05:31.320 --> 05:33.060\n but the denominator is much harder.\n\n05:33.060 --> 05:35.060\n How much controversy is there about the death?\n\n05:35.060 --> 05:36.900\n We're gonna go on a million tangents.\n\n05:36.900 --> 05:40.100\n Is that, okay, we're gonna, I have a million questions.\n\n05:40.100 --> 05:43.500\n So one, I love data so much,\n\n05:43.500 --> 05:45.460\n but I'm like almost tuned out\n\n05:45.460 --> 05:47.400\n paying attention to COVID data,\n\n05:47.400 --> 05:49.900\n because I feel like I'm walking on shaky ground.\n\n05:49.900 --> 05:52.140\n I don't know who to trust.\n\n05:52.140 --> 05:54.400\n Maybe you can comment on different sources of data,\n\n05:54.400 --> 05:55.980\n different kinds of data.\n\n05:55.980 --> 05:59.140\n The death one, that seems like a really important one.\n\n05:59.140 --> 06:03.220\n Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID,\n\n06:03.220 --> 06:06.020\n or is it just a giant, messy thing that mixed up?\n\n06:06.020 --> 06:09.600\n And then there's this kind of stories about hospitals\n\n06:09.600 --> 06:14.300\n being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.\n\n06:14.300 --> 06:16.440\n So there's some truth in some of that.\n\n06:16.440 --> 06:19.060\n Let me just talk about the incentives.\n\n06:19.060 --> 06:23.200\n So in the United States, we passed this CARES Act\n\n06:23.200 --> 06:26.400\n that was aimed at making sure hospital systems\n\n06:26.400 --> 06:29.480\n didn't go bankrupt in the early days of the pandemic.\n\n06:29.480 --> 06:30.420\n The couple of things they did,\n\n06:30.420 --> 06:34.620\n one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients,\n\n06:34.620 --> 06:38.780\n tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient.\n\n06:38.780 --> 06:41.780\n And the other thing they did is they gave a 20% bump\n\n06:41.780 --> 06:43.560\n to Medicare payments for elderly patients\n\n06:43.560 --> 06:44.420\n who are treated with COVID.\n\n06:44.420 --> 06:46.360\n The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them\n\n06:46.360 --> 06:48.320\n at the early days.\n\n06:48.320 --> 06:49.500\n So that did provide an incentive\n\n06:49.500 --> 06:52.540\n to sort of have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital,\n\n06:52.540 --> 06:55.900\n because your financial success of the hospital,\n\n06:55.900 --> 06:57.900\n or at least not lack of financial ruin\n\n06:57.900 --> 07:00.620\n depended on having many COVID patients.\n\n07:00.620 --> 07:02.140\n The other thing on the death certificates\n\n07:02.140 --> 07:04.100\n is that reporting of deaths is a separate issue.\n\n07:04.100 --> 07:06.540\n I don't know that there's a financial incentive there,\n\n07:06.540 --> 07:08.900\n but there is this sort of like complicated,\n\n07:08.900 --> 07:11.240\n you know, when you fill out a death certificate\n\n07:11.240 --> 07:13.940\n for a patient with a lot of conditions,\n\n07:13.940 --> 07:15.380\n like let's say a patient has diabetes,\n\n07:15.380 --> 07:17.620\n a patient that, well, that diabetes could lead\n\n07:17.620 --> 07:20.020\n to heart failure.\n\n07:20.020 --> 07:22.080\n You know, you have a heart attack, heart failure,\n\n07:22.080 --> 07:26.420\n your lungs fill up, then you get COVID and you die.\n\n07:26.420 --> 07:28.200\n So what do you write on the death certificate?\n\n07:28.200 --> 07:29.540\n Was it COVID that killed you?\n\n07:29.540 --> 07:31.220\n Was it the lungs filling up?\n\n07:31.220 --> 07:32.860\n Was it the heart failure?\n\n07:32.860 --> 07:34.060\n Was it the diabetes?\n\n07:34.060 --> 07:36.760\n It's really difficult to like disentangle.\n\n07:37.660 --> 07:40.160\n And I think a lot of times what's happened\n\n07:40.160 --> 07:42.020\n is that people have like erred\n\n07:42.020 --> 07:44.860\n on the side of signing it as COVID.\n\n07:44.860 --> 07:46.140\n Now, what's the evidence of this?\n\n07:46.140 --> 07:49.640\n There's been a couple of audits of death certificates\n\n07:49.640 --> 07:51.060\n in places like Santa Clara County,\n\n07:51.060 --> 07:54.260\n where I live, in Alameda County, California,\n\n07:54.260 --> 07:56.540\n where they carefully went through the death certificate\n\n07:56.540 --> 07:57.940\n and said, okay, is this reasonable to say\n\n07:57.940 --> 08:00.860\n this was actually COVID or it was COVID incidental?\n\n08:00.860 --> 08:03.780\n And they found that about 25%, 20, 25% of the deaths\n\n08:03.780 --> 08:08.380\n were more likely incidental than directly due to COVID.\n\n08:08.380 --> 08:10.440\n I personally don't get too excited about this.\n\n08:10.440 --> 08:12.260\n I mean, it's a philosophical question, right?\n\n08:12.260 --> 08:14.980\n Like ultimately, what kills you?\n\n08:16.180 --> 08:19.380\n Which is an odd thing to say if you're not in medicine,\n\n08:19.380 --> 08:23.340\n but like really, it's almost always multifactorial.\n\n08:23.340 --> 08:25.140\n It's not always just the bus hits you.\n\n08:25.140 --> 08:27.180\n The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed.\n\n08:27.180 --> 08:28.700\n Was it the brain bleed that killed you?\n\n08:28.700 --> 08:29.620\n Would it have burst anyway?\n\n08:29.620 --> 08:32.440\n I mean, you know, the bus hits you, killed you, right?\n\n08:32.440 --> 08:34.120\n The way you die is a philosophical question,\n\n08:34.120 --> 08:36.820\n but it's also a sociological and psychological question\n\n08:36.820 --> 08:40.360\n because it seems like every single person\n\n08:40.360 --> 08:43.140\n who has passed away over the past couple of years,\n\n08:43.140 --> 08:44.980\n kind of the first question that comes to mind.\n\n08:44.980 --> 08:45.820\n Was it COVID?\n\n08:45.820 --> 08:46.640\n Was it COVID?\n\n08:46.640 --> 08:48.380\n Not just because you're trying to be political,\n\n08:48.380 --> 08:49.380\n but just in your mind.\n\n08:49.380 --> 08:51.900\n No, I think there's a psychological reason for this, right?\n\n08:51.900 --> 08:55.520\n So, you know, we spent the better part\n\n08:55.520 --> 08:57.700\n of at least a half century in the United States\n\n08:57.700 --> 09:01.700\n not worried too much about infectious diseases.\n\n09:01.700 --> 09:03.820\n The notion was we essentially conquered them.\n\n09:03.820 --> 09:04.780\n It was something that happens\n\n09:04.780 --> 09:06.960\n in far away places to other people.\n\n09:07.820 --> 09:10.000\n And that's true for much of the developed world.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:13.940\n Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades.\n\n09:13.940 --> 09:16.080\n And for the first time in living memory,\n\n09:16.080 --> 09:18.340\n we have a disease that can kill us.\n\n09:18.340 --> 09:21.300\n I mean, I think we're effectively evolved to fear that,\n\n09:21.300 --> 09:23.380\n like the panic centers of our brain,\n\n09:23.380 --> 09:26.020\n the lizard part of our brain takes over.\n\n09:26.020 --> 09:29.940\n And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk.\n\n09:29.940 --> 09:32.400\n And so it's not surprising that people,\n\n09:32.400 --> 09:33.900\n when they're filling out death certificates\n\n09:33.900 --> 09:36.580\n or thinking about what led to the death,\n\n09:36.580 --> 09:38.980\n this most salient thing that's in the front\n\n09:38.980 --> 09:41.200\n of everyone's brain would jump to the top.\n\n09:41.200 --> 09:46.200\n And we can't ignore this very deep psychological thing\n\n09:46.840 --> 09:51.000\n when we consider what people say on the internet,\n\n09:51.000 --> 09:52.320\n what people say to each other,\n\n09:52.320 --> 09:55.720\n what people write in scientific papers, everything.\n\n09:55.720 --> 10:00.720\n It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,\n\n10:05.160 --> 10:09.320\n everything changed in the way people feel about each other,\n\n10:09.320 --> 10:11.760\n just the way they communicate with each other.\n\n10:11.760 --> 10:15.820\n I think the level of emotion involved,\n\n10:15.820 --> 10:19.420\n I think in many people, it brought out the worst in them.\n\n10:20.520 --> 10:22.200\n For sometimes short periods of time\n\n10:22.200 --> 10:24.200\n and sometimes it was always therapeutic,\n\n10:24.200 --> 10:25.520\n like you were waiting to get out\n\n10:25.520 --> 10:27.720\n like the darkest parts of you,\n\n10:27.720 --> 10:30.240\n just to say, if you're angry at something in this world,\n\n10:30.240 --> 10:31.740\n I'm going to say it now.\n\n10:31.740 --> 10:34.040\n And I think that's probably talking\n\n10:34.040 --> 10:38.600\n to some deep primal thing that fear we have\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:41.800\n for formalities of all different kinds.\n\n10:41.800 --> 10:43.960\n And then when that fear is aroused\n\n10:43.960 --> 10:46.000\n in all the deepest emotions,\n\n10:46.000 --> 10:49.880\n it's like a Freudian psychotherapy session,\n\n10:49.880 --> 10:51.200\n but across the world.\n\n10:51.200 --> 10:53.800\n It's something that psychologists are going to have\n\n10:53.800 --> 10:56.480\n a field day with for a generation trying to understand.\n\n10:56.480 --> 10:59.160\n I mean, I think what you say is right,\n\n10:59.160 --> 11:02.540\n but piled on top of that is also this sort of,\n\n11:04.220 --> 11:05.960\n this impetus to empathy,\n\n11:05.960 --> 11:08.640\n the empathized compassion toward others,\n\n11:08.640 --> 11:11.320\n essentially militarized, right?\n\n11:11.320 --> 11:16.320\n So I'm protecting you by some actions\n\n11:16.520 --> 11:20.280\n and those actions, if I don't do them,\n\n11:20.280 --> 11:21.120\n if you don't do them,\n\n11:21.120 --> 11:24.400\n well, that must mean you hate me.\n\n11:24.400 --> 11:26.400\n It's created this like social tension\n\n11:26.400 --> 11:27.240\n that I've never seen before.\n\n11:27.240 --> 11:30.960\n And we looked at each other\n\n11:30.960 --> 11:35.620\n as if we were just simply sources of germs\n\n11:35.620 --> 11:37.840\n rather than people to get to know,\n\n11:37.840 --> 11:41.180\n people to enjoy, people to get to learn from.\n\n11:41.180 --> 11:44.840\n It colored basically almost every human interaction\n\n11:44.840 --> 11:47.200\n for every human on the planet.\n\n11:47.200 --> 11:49.600\n Yeah, the basic common humanity.\n\n11:49.600 --> 11:50.880\n It's like you can wear a mask,\n\n11:50.880 --> 11:52.680\n you can stand far away,\n\n11:52.680 --> 11:54.700\n but the love you have for each other\n\n11:54.700 --> 11:56.200\n when you're looking into each other's eyes,\n\n11:56.200 --> 11:59.920\n that was dissipating by region too.\n\n11:59.920 --> 12:01.520\n I've experienced having traveled\n\n12:01.520 --> 12:03.660\n quite a bit throughout this time.\n\n12:03.660 --> 12:06.320\n It was really sad,\n\n12:06.320 --> 12:08.360\n even people that are really close together,\n\n12:08.360 --> 12:09.760\n just the way they stood,\n\n12:09.760 --> 12:11.560\n the way they looked at each other.\n\n12:11.560 --> 12:14.280\n And it made me feel for a moment\n\n12:15.560 --> 12:17.400\n that the fabric that connects all of us\n\n12:17.400 --> 12:20.000\n is more fragile than I thought.\n\n12:20.000 --> 12:21.280\n I mean, if you walk down the street,\n\n12:21.280 --> 12:23.200\n or if you ever, if you did this during COVID,\n\n12:23.200 --> 12:24.400\n I'm sure you had this experience\n\n12:24.400 --> 12:25.440\n where you walk down the street,\n\n12:25.440 --> 12:26.400\n if you're not wearing a mask,\n\n12:26.400 --> 12:27.700\n or even if you are,\n\n12:27.700 --> 12:30.240\n people will jump off the sidewalk\n\n12:30.240 --> 12:31.960\n that you walked past them,\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:33.960\n as if you're poison,\n\n12:33.960 --> 12:37.920\n even though the data are that COVID spreads\n\n12:37.920 --> 12:39.040\n indifferently outdoors,\n\n12:39.040 --> 12:41.440\n or if at all, really, outdoors.\n\n12:41.440 --> 12:43.480\n But it's not simply a biological\n\n12:43.480 --> 12:45.440\n or infectious disease phenomenon,\n\n12:45.440 --> 12:46.280\n or epidemiological phenomenon.\n\n12:46.280 --> 12:50.680\n It is a change in the way humans treated each other,\n\n12:50.680 --> 12:52.840\n I hope temporary.\n\n12:52.840 --> 12:54.840\n I do wanna say on the flip side of that,\n\n12:54.840 --> 12:58.240\n so I was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts\n\n12:58.240 --> 12:59.480\n when the pandemic broke out.\n\n12:59.480 --> 13:01.440\n I think that's where I was, yeah.\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:04.320\n And then I came here to Austin, Texas\n\n13:04.320 --> 13:07.560\n to visit my now good friend, Joe Rogan,\n\n13:07.560 --> 13:11.000\n and he was the first person without pause,\n\n13:11.000 --> 13:12.360\n this wasn't a political statement,\n\n13:12.360 --> 13:13.400\n this was anything,\n\n13:13.400 --> 13:16.560\n just walked toward me and gave me a big hug\n\n13:16.560 --> 13:18.360\n and say, it's great to see you.\n\n13:18.360 --> 13:20.360\n And I can't tell you how great it felt\n\n13:20.360 --> 13:21.640\n because I, in that moment,\n\n13:21.640 --> 13:24.240\n realized the absence of that connection back in Boston\n\n13:24.240 --> 13:26.840\n over just a couple of months.\n\n13:26.840 --> 13:30.180\n And it's, we'll talk about it more,\n\n13:30.180 --> 13:34.200\n but it's tragic to think about that distancing,\n\n13:34.200 --> 13:36.880\n that dissolution of common humanity at scale,\n\n13:36.880 --> 13:39.400\n what kind of impact it has on society.\n\n13:39.400 --> 13:43.200\n Just across the board, political division,\n\n13:43.200 --> 13:45.380\n and just in the quiet of your own mind,\n\n13:45.380 --> 13:47.560\n in the privacy of your own home, the depression,\n\n13:47.560 --> 13:51.180\n the sadness, the loneliness that leads to suicide.\n\n13:51.180 --> 13:55.800\n And forget suicide, just low key suffering.\n\n13:55.800 --> 13:58.400\n Yeah, no, I think that's the suffering,\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:00.940\n that isolation, we're not meant to live alone,\n\n14:00.940 --> 14:02.400\n we're not meant to live apart from one another.\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:04.440\n I mean, that's, of course, the ideology of lockdown\n\n14:04.440 --> 14:07.920\n is to make people live apart, alone, isolated,\n\n14:07.920 --> 14:10.240\n so that we don't spread diseases to each other, right?\n\n14:10.240 --> 14:12.280\n But we're not actually designed as a species\n\n14:12.280 --> 14:13.180\n to live that way.\n\n14:14.100 --> 14:16.600\n And that, what you're describing, I think,\n\n14:16.600 --> 14:19.260\n if everyone's honest with themselves, have felt,\n\n14:19.260 --> 14:22.020\n especially in places where lockdowns have been\n\n14:22.020 --> 14:23.940\n sort of very militantly enforced,\n\n14:23.940 --> 14:26.420\n has felt deep into their core.\n\n14:26.420 --> 14:29.200\n Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths.\n\n14:30.060 --> 14:31.580\n You said that the data isn't perfect,\n\n14:31.580 --> 14:35.460\n because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys\n\n14:35.460 --> 14:37.940\n to understand how many cases there were\n\n14:37.940 --> 14:39.940\n to determine the rate of deaths.\n\n14:39.940 --> 14:42.100\n And we need to have a strong footing\n\n14:42.100 --> 14:42.940\n in the number of deaths.\n\n14:42.940 --> 14:45.800\n But if we assume that the number of deaths\n\n14:45.800 --> 14:49.260\n is approximately correct, like what's your sense,\n\n14:49.260 --> 14:52.660\n what kind of statements can we say about the deadliness\n\n14:52.660 --> 14:55.920\n of COVID across different demographics?\n\n14:55.920 --> 14:58.820\n Maybe not in a political way or in the current way,\n\n14:58.820 --> 15:03.380\n but when history looks back at this moment of time,\n\n15:03.380 --> 15:05.220\n 50 years from now, 100 years from now,\n\n15:05.220 --> 15:09.540\n the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago,\n\n15:09.540 --> 15:12.500\n what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?\n\n15:12.500 --> 15:14.980\n I mean, I think the deadliness of COVID depends on\n\n15:14.980 --> 15:18.480\n not just the virus itself, but who it infects.\n\n15:18.480 --> 15:20.380\n So probably the most important thing about it,\n\n15:20.380 --> 15:21.780\n about the deadliness of COVID,\n\n15:21.780 --> 15:26.260\n is this steep age gradient in the mortality rate.\n\n15:26.260 --> 15:28.900\n So according to these seroprevalence studies\n\n15:28.900 --> 15:31.680\n that have been done, now hundreds of them,\n\n15:32.720 --> 15:34.380\n mostly from before vaccination,\n\n15:34.380 --> 15:35.580\n because vaccination also reduces\n\n15:35.580 --> 15:37.780\n the mortality risk of COVID,\n\n15:37.780 --> 15:42.460\n the seroprevalence studies suggest that the risk of death,\n\n15:42.460 --> 15:47.260\n if you're, say, over the age of 70, is very high.\n\n15:47.260 --> 15:50.620\n You know, 5% if you get COVID.\n\n15:50.620 --> 15:54.020\n If you're under the age of 70, it's lower, 0.05.\n\n15:54.020 --> 15:56.380\n But there's not a single sharp cutoff.\n\n15:56.380 --> 15:59.520\n It's more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use.\n\n15:59.520 --> 16:03.400\n So if you're 50, say, the infection fatality rate\n\n16:03.400 --> 16:07.500\n from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data.\n\n16:07.500 --> 16:11.460\n That means 99.8% survival if you're 50.\n\n16:11.460 --> 16:14.580\n And for every seven years of age above that, double it.\n\n16:14.580 --> 16:17.020\n Every seven years of age below that, halve it.\n\n16:17.020 --> 16:20.940\n So a 57 year old would have a 0.4%.\n\n16:20.940 --> 16:24.680\n Mortality, a 64 year old would have a 0.8% and so on.\n\n16:24.680 --> 16:26.860\n And if you have a severe chronic disease,\n\n16:26.860 --> 16:29.500\n like diabetes or if you're morbidly obese,\n\n16:29.500 --> 16:32.420\n it's like adding seven years to your life.\n\n16:32.420 --> 16:35.060\n And this is for unvaccinated folks?\n\n16:35.060 --> 16:38.940\n This is unvaccinated before Delta also.\n\n16:38.940 --> 16:41.700\n Are there a lot of people that would be listening to this\n\n16:41.700 --> 16:43.940\n with PhDs at the end of their name\n\n16:43.940 --> 16:47.500\n that would disagree with the 99.8, would you say?\n\n16:47.500 --> 16:49.940\n So I think there's some disagreement over this.\n\n16:49.940 --> 16:52.980\n And the disagreement is about the quality\n\n16:52.980 --> 16:56.260\n of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted.\n\n16:56.260 --> 16:58.900\n So as I said earlier, I was the senior investigator\n\n16:58.900 --> 17:00.620\n in three different seroprevalence studies\n\n17:00.620 --> 17:02.020\n very early in the epidemic.\n\n17:03.060 --> 17:05.220\n I view them as very high quality studies.\n\n17:07.100 --> 17:10.700\n In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit\n\n17:10.700 --> 17:15.700\n that we obtained from someone who works\n\n17:16.260 --> 17:18.020\n in major league baseball, actually.\n\n17:18.020 --> 17:21.300\n He had ordered these test kits very early in March, 2020,\n\n17:21.300 --> 17:25.980\n that measures, very accurately measures antibody levels,\n\n17:25.980 --> 17:28.620\n antibodies in the bloodstream.\n\n17:28.620 --> 17:31.700\n These test kits were eventually were approved by the,\n\n17:31.700 --> 17:35.980\n had an EUA by the emergency use authorization by the FDA,\n\n17:35.980 --> 17:37.760\n sort of shortly after we did this.\n\n17:37.760 --> 17:40.260\n And it had a very low false positive rate,\n\n17:40.260 --> 17:43.500\n false positive means if you don't have\n\n17:43.500 --> 17:46.100\n these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream,\n\n17:46.100 --> 17:48.340\n the kit shows up positive anyways.\n\n17:48.340 --> 17:51.420\n That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time.\n\n17:52.580 --> 17:56.060\n And based on studies, a very large number of studies\n\n17:56.060 --> 18:00.540\n looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit,\n\n18:00.540 --> 18:03.340\n and 0.5% of the time, 2018,\n\n18:03.340 --> 18:05.620\n there shouldn't be antibodies there to COVID.\n\n18:05.620 --> 18:08.780\n So if it turns positive to false positives, 0.5% of the time.\n\n18:08.780 --> 18:13.780\n And then like a false negative rate, about 10%, 12%,\n\n18:14.380 --> 18:16.740\n something like that, I don't remember the exact number,\n\n18:16.740 --> 18:18.980\n but the false positive rate is the important thing there.\n\n18:18.980 --> 18:22.420\n So you have a population in March, 2020 or April, 2020,\n\n18:22.420 --> 18:25.300\n with very low fraction of patients\n\n18:25.300 --> 18:26.580\n having been exposed to COVID,\n\n18:26.580 --> 18:28.780\n you don't know how much, but low,\n\n18:28.780 --> 18:30.380\n even a small false positive rate\n\n18:30.380 --> 18:33.440\n could end up biasing your study quite a bit.\n\n18:34.340 --> 18:36.020\n But there's a formula to adjust for that.\n\n18:36.020 --> 18:37.540\n You can adjust for the false positive rate,\n\n18:37.540 --> 18:38.380\n false negative rate.\n\n18:38.380 --> 18:42.060\n We did that adjustment, and those studies found\n\n18:42.060 --> 18:43.460\n in a community population,\n\n18:43.460 --> 18:45.100\n so leaving aside people in nursing homes\n\n18:45.100 --> 18:47.100\n who have a higher death rate from COVID,\n\n18:48.660 --> 18:52.060\n the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County\n\n18:52.060 --> 18:53.460\n and in LA County.\n\n18:53.460 --> 18:56.060\n Across all age groups in a community,\n\n18:56.060 --> 18:58.100\n community meaning just like regular folks.\n\n18:58.100 --> 19:00.180\n Yeah, so that's actually a real important question too.\n\n19:00.180 --> 19:02.180\n So the Santa Clara study,\n\n19:02.180 --> 19:04.400\n we did this Facebook sampling scheme,\n\n19:05.780 --> 19:08.060\n which is, I mean, not the ideal thing,\n\n19:08.060 --> 19:11.140\n but it was very difficult to get a random sample\n\n19:11.140 --> 19:13.300\n and during lockdown,\n\n19:14.180 --> 19:17.060\n where we put out an ad on Facebook\n\n19:17.060 --> 19:19.860\n soliciting people to volunteer for the study,\n\n19:19.860 --> 19:22.260\n randomly selected set of people.\n\n19:22.260 --> 19:24.120\n We were hoping to get a random selection of people\n\n19:24.120 --> 19:26.340\n from Santa Clara County, but it tended to,\n\n19:26.340 --> 19:27.580\n the people who tend to volunteer\n\n19:27.580 --> 19:28.940\n were from the richer parts of the county.\n\n19:28.940 --> 19:31.300\n Like I had Stanford professors writing,\n\n19:31.300 --> 19:32.260\n begging to be in the study\n\n19:32.260 --> 19:34.180\n because they wanted to know their antibody levels.\n\n19:34.180 --> 19:36.220\n So we did some adjustment for that.\n\n19:36.220 --> 19:38.340\n In LA County, we hired a firm\n\n19:38.340 --> 19:42.500\n that had a preexisting representative sample of LA County.\n\n19:44.460 --> 19:46.020\n But it didn't include nursing homes,\n\n19:46.020 --> 19:48.200\n it didn't include people in jail, things like that,\n\n19:48.200 --> 19:49.760\n didn't include the homeless populations.\n\n19:49.760 --> 19:53.860\n So it's representative of a community dwelling population,\n\n19:53.860 --> 19:54.940\n both of those.\n\n19:54.940 --> 19:57.940\n And there we found that both in LA County\n\n19:57.940 --> 20:00.360\n and Santa Clara County in April, 2020,\n\n20:00.360 --> 20:04.260\n something like 40 to 50 times more infections\n\n20:04.260 --> 20:06.780\n than cases in both places.\n\n20:06.780 --> 20:09.220\n So for every case that had been reported\n\n20:09.220 --> 20:10.940\n to the public health authorities,\n\n20:10.940 --> 20:15.340\n we found 40 or 50 other infections,\n\n20:15.340 --> 20:17.940\n people with antibodies in their blood\n\n20:17.940 --> 20:20.220\n that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered.\n\n20:20.220 --> 20:21.580\n So people were not reporting,\n\n20:21.580 --> 20:25.020\n or severe, at least in those days, underreporting.\n\n20:25.020 --> 20:26.900\n Yeah, I mean, there was testing problem.\n\n20:26.900 --> 20:29.020\n I mean, there weren't so many tests available.\n\n20:29.020 --> 20:30.180\n People didn't know.\n\n20:30.180 --> 20:32.720\n A lot of them, we asked a set of questions\n\n20:32.720 --> 20:34.860\n about the symptoms they'd faced,\n\n20:34.860 --> 20:36.340\n and most of them said they'd faced no symptoms,\n\n20:36.340 --> 20:38.300\n or at the most, 30, 40% of them said\n\n20:38.300 --> 20:39.460\n they'd faced no symptoms.\n\n20:40.780 --> 20:42.200\n And I mean, even these days,\n\n20:42.200 --> 20:44.260\n how many people report that they get COVID\n\n20:44.260 --> 20:45.100\n when they get COVID?\n\n20:45.100 --> 20:49.140\n Okay, have those numbers, that 0.2%,\n\n20:49.140 --> 20:51.420\n has that approximately held up over time?\n\n20:51.420 --> 20:53.420\n That is, so Professor John Ioannidis,\n\n20:53.420 --> 20:55.260\n who's a colleague of mine at Stanford,\n\n20:55.260 --> 20:56.800\n is a world expert in meta now,\n\n20:56.800 --> 21:00.140\n so probably the most cited scientist on Earth, I think,\n\n21:00.140 --> 21:01.220\n at least living.\n\n21:01.220 --> 21:04.780\n He did a meta analysis of now 100 or more\n\n21:04.780 --> 21:06.460\n of these seroprevalence studies.\n\n21:08.020 --> 21:11.540\n And what he found was that that 0.2%\n\n21:11.540 --> 21:13.820\n is roughly the worldwide number.\n\n21:13.820 --> 21:17.380\n In fact, I think he cites this lower number, 0.15%,\n\n21:17.380 --> 21:20.620\n as the median infection fatality rate worldwide.\n\n21:20.620 --> 21:21.900\n So we did these studies,\n\n21:21.900 --> 21:25.220\n and it generated an enormous amount of blowback\n\n21:25.220 --> 21:27.060\n by people who thought that the infection fatality rate\n\n21:27.060 --> 21:28.460\n is much higher.\n\n21:28.460 --> 21:30.420\n And there's some controversy over the quality\n\n21:30.420 --> 21:32.380\n of some of the other studies that are done.\n\n21:32.380 --> 21:34.700\n And so there are some people who look at this\n\n21:34.700 --> 21:36.380\n same literature and say, well,\n\n21:36.380 --> 21:39.780\n the lower quality studies tend to have lower IFRs.\n\n21:39.780 --> 21:40.620\n The higher quality studies.\n\n21:40.620 --> 21:41.460\n IFR?\n\n21:41.460 --> 21:43.380\n Oh, infection fatality rate, I apologize.\n\n21:43.380 --> 21:45.740\n I do this in lectures, too, I apologize.\n\n21:45.740 --> 21:47.620\n And I'm going to rudely interrupt you\n\n21:48.620 --> 21:51.660\n and ask for the basics sometimes, if it's okay.\n\n21:51.660 --> 21:52.580\n No, of course.\n\n21:52.580 --> 21:55.500\n So these higher quality studies, they say,\n\n21:55.500 --> 21:56.620\n tend to produce higher IFR.\n\n21:56.620 --> 21:58.820\n But the problem is that if you want\n\n21:58.820 --> 22:00.860\n a global infection fatality rate,\n\n22:00.860 --> 22:04.420\n you need to get seroprevalence studies from everywhere,\n\n22:04.420 --> 22:05.940\n even in places that don't necessarily\n\n22:05.940 --> 22:07.060\n have the infrastructure set up\n\n22:07.060 --> 22:09.620\n to produce very, very high quality studies.\n\n22:09.620 --> 22:11.980\n And in poor places in the world,\n\n22:14.740 --> 22:15.900\n places like Africa,\n\n22:15.900 --> 22:18.220\n the infection fatality rate is incredibly low.\n\n22:20.020 --> 22:23.500\n And in some richer places, like New York City,\n\n22:23.500 --> 22:25.780\n the infection fatality rate is much higher.\n\n22:25.780 --> 22:30.780\n There's a range of IFRs, not a single number.\n\n22:30.780 --> 22:32.620\n This sometimes surprises people,\n\n22:32.620 --> 22:34.140\n because they think, well, it's a virus,\n\n22:34.140 --> 22:36.780\n it should have the same properties no matter where it goes.\n\n22:36.780 --> 22:41.780\n But the virus kills or infects or hurts\n\n22:42.140 --> 22:44.740\n in interaction with the host.\n\n22:44.740 --> 22:47.780\n And the properties of both the host and the virus\n\n22:47.780 --> 22:50.140\n combine to produce the outcome.\n\n22:50.140 --> 22:53.020\n But you also mentioned the environment, too?\n\n22:53.020 --> 22:55.580\n Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person.\n\n22:55.580 --> 22:56.900\n Like if I'm gonna think about it,\n\n22:56.900 --> 22:58.820\n the most simplest way to think about it is age.\n\n22:58.820 --> 23:01.220\n Age is the single most important risk factor.\n\n23:01.220 --> 23:05.980\n So older places are going to have a higher IFR\n\n23:05.980 --> 23:07.020\n than younger places.\n\n23:07.020 --> 23:10.140\n Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.\n\n23:10.140 --> 23:12.660\n So in some sense, it's not surprising\n\n23:12.660 --> 23:15.380\n that they have a low infection fatality rate.\n\n23:15.380 --> 23:16.900\n So that's one way you would explain\n\n23:16.900 --> 23:18.980\n the difference between Africa and New York City\n\n23:18.980 --> 23:22.020\n in terms of the fatality rate, is the age, the average age?\n\n23:22.020 --> 23:24.820\n Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic\n\n23:24.820 --> 23:29.740\n in New York City, the older populations\n\n23:29.740 --> 23:33.380\n living in nursing homes were differentially infected\n\n23:33.380 --> 23:35.900\n based on, because of policies that were adopted,\n\n23:35.900 --> 23:39.100\n to send COVID infected patients back to nursing homes\n\n23:39.100 --> 23:40.340\n to keep hospitals empty.\n\n23:40.340 --> 23:42.900\n What do you mean by differentially infected?\n\n23:42.900 --> 23:47.380\n The policy that you adopt determines who is most exposed.\n\n23:47.380 --> 23:48.500\n Right, okay.\n\n23:48.500 --> 23:49.340\n So that's what I mean by different.\n\n23:49.340 --> 23:52.820\n The policy, it's the person that matters.\n\n23:52.820 --> 23:56.140\n I mean, it's not like the virus just kind of doesn't care.\n\n23:56.140 --> 23:59.340\n I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction.\n\n23:59.340 --> 24:01.660\n And there's also, I mean, there is some contribution\n\n24:01.660 --> 24:04.900\n from the environment, different regions\n\n24:04.900 --> 24:08.300\n have different proximity maybe of people interacting\n\n24:08.300 --> 24:10.100\n or the dynamics of the way they interact.\n\n24:10.100 --> 24:12.740\n Yeah, like if you have situations\n\n24:12.740 --> 24:17.260\n where there's lots of intergenerational interactions,\n\n24:17.260 --> 24:19.500\n then you have a very different risk profile\n\n24:19.500 --> 24:21.500\n than if you have societies\n\n24:21.500 --> 24:23.540\n that are where generations are more separate\n\n24:23.540 --> 24:24.380\n from one another.\n\n24:25.860 --> 24:27.620\n Okay, so let me just finish real fast about this.\n\n24:27.620 --> 24:32.620\n So you have in New York, you have a population\n\n24:32.820 --> 24:34.180\n that was infected in the early days\n\n24:34.180 --> 24:36.980\n that was very likely going to die,\n\n24:36.980 --> 24:40.140\n had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected.\n\n24:40.140 --> 24:43.220\n And so New York City had a higher IFR,\n\n24:43.220 --> 24:48.220\n especially in the early days than like Africa has had.\n\n24:49.260 --> 24:50.900\n The other thing is treatment, right?\n\n24:50.900 --> 24:52.940\n So the treatments that we adopted\n\n24:52.940 --> 24:54.020\n in the early days of the epidemic,\n\n24:54.020 --> 24:58.220\n I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death.\n\n24:58.220 --> 25:00.100\n Which treatments?\n\n25:00.100 --> 25:03.180\n Using ventilators, like the over reliance on ventilators\n\n25:03.180 --> 25:04.580\n is what I'm primarily thinking of,\n\n25:04.580 --> 25:06.520\n but I can think of other things.\n\n25:06.520 --> 25:09.620\n But that also we've learned over time\n\n25:09.620 --> 25:12.700\n how better to manage patients with the disease.\n\n25:12.700 --> 25:14.700\n So you have all those things combined.\n\n25:14.700 --> 25:18.100\n So that's where the controversy over this number is.\n\n25:18.100 --> 25:23.100\n I mean, New York City also is a central hub\n\n25:23.660 --> 25:28.660\n for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories\n\n25:29.220 --> 25:31.740\n and narratives in article form.\n\n25:31.740 --> 25:34.700\n And I remember those quite dramatic stories\n\n25:34.700 --> 25:36.500\n about sort of doctors in the hospitals\n\n25:36.500 --> 25:37.380\n and these kinds of things.\n\n25:37.380 --> 25:40.500\n I mean, there's very serious, very dramatic,\n\n25:40.500 --> 25:44.840\n very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals.\n\n25:44.840 --> 25:49.840\n Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a deathbed,\n\n25:50.860 --> 25:52.340\n that's always tragic.\n\n25:52.340 --> 25:55.220\n And you can always write a hell of a good story about that.\n\n25:55.220 --> 25:58.220\n And you should, about the loss of loved ones.\n\n25:58.220 --> 26:01.820\n But they were doing it pretty well, I would say,\n\n26:01.820 --> 26:04.060\n over this kind of dramatic deaths.\n\n26:04.060 --> 26:09.060\n And so in response to that, it's very unpleasant to hear,\n\n26:09.240 --> 26:11.140\n even to consider the possibility\n\n26:11.140 --> 26:16.140\n that the death rate is not as high as you might feel.\n\n26:17.500 --> 26:20.580\n Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction,\n\n26:20.580 --> 26:23.860\n both by regular people and also the scientific community\n\n26:23.860 --> 26:25.660\n in response to those studies,\n\n26:25.660 --> 26:28.240\n those early studies in April of 2020.\n\n26:29.100 --> 26:31.620\n To me, they were studies.\n\n26:31.620 --> 26:33.640\n I mean, they're the kinds of,\n\n26:33.640 --> 26:35.620\n not exactly the kinds of work I've worked on all my life,\n\n26:35.620 --> 26:39.700\n but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper\n\n26:39.700 --> 26:42.860\n and you get responses from your fellow scientists\n\n26:42.860 --> 26:45.340\n and you change the paper to improve it,\n\n26:45.340 --> 26:47.260\n you hopefully learn something from it.\n\n26:47.260 --> 26:50.480\n Well, but to push back, it's just a study.\n\n26:50.480 --> 26:53.260\n But there's some studies, and this is kind of interesting,\n\n26:53.260 --> 26:57.200\n because I've received similar pushback on other topics.\n\n26:59.380 --> 27:04.380\n There's some studies that, if wrong,\n\n27:04.380 --> 27:09.380\n might have wide ranging detrimental effects on society.\n\n27:09.740 --> 27:12.000\n So that's the way they would perceive the studies.\n\n27:12.000 --> 27:13.900\n If you say the death rate is lower,\n\n27:13.900 --> 27:16.500\n and you end up, as you often do in science,\n\n27:16.500 --> 27:19.940\n realizing that, nope, that was a flaw\n\n27:19.940 --> 27:21.140\n in the way the study was conducted,\n\n27:21.140 --> 27:23.900\n or we're just not representative of a broader population,\n\n27:23.900 --> 27:26.020\n and then you realize the death rate is much higher,\n\n27:26.020 --> 27:29.620\n that might be very damaging in people's view.\n\n27:29.620 --> 27:33.500\n So that's probably where the scientific community\n\n27:33.500 --> 27:36.660\n sort of just steel man the kind of response,\n\n27:36.660 --> 27:39.080\n is that's where they felt like,\n\n27:40.020 --> 27:43.420\n there's some findings where you better be damn sure\n\n27:43.420 --> 27:45.880\n before you kind of report them.\n\n27:45.880 --> 27:47.400\n Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right,\n\n27:47.400 --> 27:48.500\n and it turns out we were right.\n\n27:48.500 --> 27:53.500\n So we released the Santa Clara study\n\n27:54.120 --> 27:56.780\n via this open science process\n\n27:56.780 --> 27:59.860\n and this server called MedArchive.\n\n27:59.860 --> 28:02.220\n It's designed for releasing studies\n\n28:02.220 --> 28:03.900\n that have not yet been peer reviewed\n\n28:03.900 --> 28:06.540\n in order to garner comment from the scientists\n\n28:06.540 --> 28:07.600\n before peer review.\n\n28:08.540 --> 28:09.880\n The LA County study,\n\n28:09.880 --> 28:12.400\n we went through this traditional peer review process\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:13.660\n and got it published in the Journal\n\n28:13.660 --> 28:16.580\n of American Medical Association sometime in like July,\n\n28:16.580 --> 28:19.040\n I think, I forget the date, of 2020.\n\n28:19.040 --> 28:22.000\n The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020\n\n28:22.000 --> 28:25.100\n in this sort of working paper archive.\n\n28:25.100 --> 28:28.180\n The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,\n\n28:28.180 --> 28:31.960\n we had a result that we thought was quite important,\n\n28:31.960 --> 28:35.020\n and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it\n\n28:35.020 --> 28:36.700\n and also tell the world about it.\n\n28:36.700 --> 28:38.100\n And we wanted to get feedback.\n\n28:38.100 --> 28:39.840\n I mean, that's part of the purpose\n\n28:39.840 --> 28:42.280\n of sending it to these kinds of places.\n\n28:42.280 --> 28:45.500\n I think a lot of the problem is that\n\n28:45.500 --> 28:47.860\n when people think about published science,\n\n28:47.860 --> 28:50.380\n they think of it as automatically true.\n\n28:50.380 --> 28:51.460\n And if it goes through peer review,\n\n28:51.460 --> 28:52.300\n it's automatically true.\n\n28:52.300 --> 28:53.300\n If it hasn't gone through peer review,\n\n28:53.300 --> 28:54.940\n it's not automatically true.\n\n28:54.940 --> 28:56.540\n And especially in medicine,\n\n28:56.540 --> 28:59.860\n when we're not used to having this access\n\n28:59.860 --> 29:03.420\n to pre peer reviewed work.\n\n29:03.420 --> 29:05.860\n I mean, in economics, actually, that's quite normal.\n\n29:05.860 --> 29:07.940\n You takes years to get something published.\n\n29:07.940 --> 29:10.660\n So there's a very active debate over\n\n29:10.660 --> 29:13.460\n or discussion about papers before they're peer reviewed\n\n29:13.460 --> 29:16.260\n in this sort of working paper way,\n\n29:16.260 --> 29:20.460\n much less normal or much newer in medicine.\n\n29:20.460 --> 29:21.520\n And so I think part of that,\n\n29:21.520 --> 29:26.100\n the perception about what process happens in open science\n\n29:26.100 --> 29:29.380\n when you release a study, that got people confused.\n\n29:29.380 --> 29:31.500\n And you're right, it was a very important result\n\n29:31.500 --> 29:33.780\n because we had just locked the world down\n\n29:33.780 --> 29:38.740\n in middle of March with, I think, catastrophic results.\n\n29:38.740 --> 29:41.940\n And if that study was right, if our study was right,\n\n29:41.940 --> 29:44.020\n that meant we'd made a mistake.\n\n29:44.020 --> 29:45.820\n And not because the death rate was low,\n\n29:45.820 --> 29:47.800\n that's actually not the key thing there.\n\n29:47.800 --> 29:51.620\n The key thing is that we had adopted these policies,\n\n29:51.620 --> 29:53.340\n these test and trace policies,\n\n29:53.340 --> 29:55.420\n these policies, these lockdown policies\n\n29:55.420 --> 30:00.060\n aimed at suppressing the virus level to close to zero.\n\n30:00.060 --> 30:01.900\n That was essentially the idea.\n\n30:01.900 --> 30:04.820\n If we can just get the virus to go away,\n\n30:04.820 --> 30:07.420\n we won't have to ever worry about it again.\n\n30:07.420 --> 30:09.360\n The main problem with our result\n\n30:09.360 --> 30:11.580\n as far as that strategy was concerned wasn't the death rate,\n\n30:11.580 --> 30:14.820\n it was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases.\n\n30:14.820 --> 30:19.580\n It was the 2.5% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate\n\n30:19.580 --> 30:23.060\n that we identified of the antibodies in the population.\n\n30:23.060 --> 30:25.820\n If that number is right, it's too late.\n\n30:25.820 --> 30:28.140\n The virus is not going to go to zero.\n\n30:28.140 --> 30:30.260\n And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate,\n\n30:30.260 --> 30:32.860\n we're not going to get the viral level down to zero.\n\n30:34.020 --> 30:36.460\n So we're gonna have to let the virus\n\n30:36.460 --> 30:39.820\n go through the entire population in some way or some other?\n\n30:39.820 --> 30:41.160\n We can talk about that in a bit.\n\n30:41.160 --> 30:42.460\n That's the Great Barrington Declaration.\n\n30:42.460 --> 30:44.240\n You don't have to let the virus go through the population.\n\n30:44.240 --> 30:45.860\n You can shield preferentially.\n\n30:46.900 --> 30:50.060\n The policy we chose was to shield preferentially\n\n30:50.060 --> 30:52.180\n the laptop class,\n\n30:52.180 --> 30:54.660\n the set of people who could work from home\n\n30:54.660 --> 30:56.700\n without losing their job.\n\n30:56.700 --> 30:59.420\n And we did a very good job at protecting them.\n\n30:59.420 --> 31:04.080\n Well, let me take a small tangent.\n\n31:04.080 --> 31:06.620\n We're gonna jump around in time,\n\n31:06.620 --> 31:09.260\n which I think will be the best way to tell the story.\n\n31:09.260 --> 31:10.580\n So that was the beginning.\n\n31:10.580 --> 31:13.940\n Yeah, okay, actually, can I go back one more thing for that?\n\n31:13.940 --> 31:14.780\n Because that's really important\n\n31:14.780 --> 31:16.620\n and I should have started with this.\n\n31:17.540 --> 31:22.000\n What led me to do those studies was a paper\n\n31:22.000 --> 31:23.740\n that I had remembered seeing\n\n31:23.740 --> 31:26.420\n from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.\n\n31:26.420 --> 31:28.340\n This is where I've been much less active\n\n31:28.340 --> 31:29.180\n in writing about that.\n\n31:29.180 --> 31:32.880\n I had written like a paper or two about that in 2009.\n\n31:34.020 --> 31:38.780\n There was actually the same debate over the mortality rate,\n\n31:38.780 --> 31:41.660\n except it unfolded over the course of three years,\n\n31:41.660 --> 31:43.240\n two or three years.\n\n31:43.240 --> 31:47.980\n The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1\n\n31:47.980 --> 31:52.220\n counted the number of cases in the denominator,\n\n31:52.220 --> 31:53.680\n counted the number of deaths in the numerator,\n\n31:53.680 --> 31:56.620\n cases meaning people identified as having H1N1,\n\n31:56.620 --> 31:59.460\n showing up the doctor, tested to have it.\n\n32:00.500 --> 32:04.040\n And the earliest estimates of the H1N1 mortality\n\n32:04.040 --> 32:08.000\n were like 4%, 3%, really, really high.\n\n32:08.980 --> 32:11.300\n Over the course of a couple of more years,\n\n32:11.300 --> 32:12.940\n a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies,\n\n32:12.940 --> 32:15.820\n seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out.\n\n32:15.820 --> 32:20.620\n And it turned out that there were 100 or more times\n\n32:20.620 --> 32:22.220\n people infected per case.\n\n32:23.260 --> 32:27.540\n And so the mortality rate was actually something like 0.02%\n\n32:27.540 --> 32:32.060\n for H1N1, not the three, like 100 fold difference.\n\n32:32.060 --> 32:34.260\n So this made you think, okay,\n\n32:34.260 --> 32:36.180\n it took us a couple of two or three years\n\n32:36.180 --> 32:39.400\n to discover the truth behind the actual infections\n\n32:40.420 --> 32:43.940\n for H1N1, and then what's the truth here\n\n32:43.940 --> 32:45.060\n and can we get there faster?\n\n32:45.060 --> 32:49.180\n Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way as the H1N1 flu did.\n\n32:49.180 --> 32:51.640\n I mean, it spreads via solization,\n\n32:51.640 --> 32:55.480\n via person to person breathing, kind of contact up.\n\n32:55.480 --> 32:59.220\n It may be some by fomites, but it seems less likely now.\n\n32:59.220 --> 33:01.740\n In any case, it seemed really important to me\n\n33:01.740 --> 33:03.540\n to speed up the process\n\n33:03.540 --> 33:05.900\n of having those seroprevalence studies\n\n33:05.900 --> 33:09.060\n so that we can better understand who was at risk\n\n33:09.060 --> 33:12.260\n and what the right strategy ought to be.\n\n33:12.260 --> 33:17.260\n This might be a good place to kind of compare influenza,\n\n33:17.320 --> 33:20.980\n the flu, and COVID in the context of the discussion\n\n33:20.980 --> 33:24.420\n we just had, which is how deadly is COVID?\n\n33:24.420 --> 33:26.620\n So you mentioned COVID is a very particular\n\n33:26.620 --> 33:31.620\n kind of steepness, where the X axis is age.\n\n33:32.180 --> 33:36.260\n So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza\n\n33:36.260 --> 33:41.260\n and COVID, because a lot of people outside the folks\n\n33:41.260 --> 33:45.140\n who suggest that the lizards who run the world\n\n33:45.140 --> 33:48.460\n have completely fabricated and invented COVID,\n\n33:48.460 --> 33:51.900\n outside of those folks, kind of the natural process\n\n33:51.900 --> 33:54.660\n by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is, say,\n\n33:54.660 --> 33:55.900\n well, it's just like the flu.\n\n33:55.900 --> 33:58.780\n The flu is a very serious thing, actually.\n\n33:58.780 --> 34:03.660\n So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?\n\n34:03.660 --> 34:04.980\n Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing.\n\n34:04.980 --> 34:07.980\n It kills 50, 60,000 people a year,\n\n34:07.980 --> 34:08.820\n something I found out,\n\n34:08.820 --> 34:11.340\n depending on the particular strain that goes around,\n\n34:11.340 --> 34:12.760\n that's in the United States.\n\n34:12.760 --> 34:15.060\n The primary difference to me,\n\n34:15.060 --> 34:15.900\n there's lots of differences,\n\n34:15.900 --> 34:17.340\n but one of the most salient differences\n\n34:17.340 --> 34:20.120\n is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu.\n\n34:21.420 --> 34:25.820\n So the flu is more deadly to children than COVID is.\n\n34:26.660 --> 34:28.460\n There's no controversy about that.\n\n34:29.340 --> 34:34.340\n Children, thank God, have much less severe reactions\n\n34:34.340 --> 34:39.340\n to COVID infection than they do to flu infections.\n\n34:39.980 --> 34:41.900\n And rate of fatalities and stuff like that.\n\n34:41.900 --> 34:42.860\n Rate of fatality, all of that.\n\n34:42.860 --> 34:44.840\n I think you mentioned,\n\n34:44.840 --> 34:47.060\n I mean, it's interesting to maybe also comment on,\n\n34:47.060 --> 34:48.800\n I think in another conversation you mentioned\n\n34:48.800 --> 34:53.800\n there's a U shape to the flu curve,\n\n34:54.500 --> 34:57.540\n so meaning there's actually quite a large number of kids\n\n34:57.540 --> 34:59.220\n that die from flu.\n\n34:59.220 --> 35:03.000\n Yeah, I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu,\n\n35:03.000 --> 35:08.000\n the Spanish flu in the US killed millions of younger people.\n\n35:09.500 --> 35:12.380\n And that is not the case with COVID.\n\n35:13.460 --> 35:16.820\n More than, I'm gonna get the number wrong,\n\n35:16.820 --> 35:19.280\n but something like 70, 80% of the deaths\n\n35:19.280 --> 35:21.420\n are people over the age of 60.\n\n35:21.420 --> 35:24.940\n Well, we've talked about the fear the whole time, really.\n\n35:24.940 --> 35:27.960\n But my interaction with folks,\n\n35:27.960 --> 35:30.260\n now I wanna have a family, I wanna have kids,\n\n35:30.260 --> 35:32.820\n but I don't have that real firsthand experience,\n\n35:32.820 --> 35:35.860\n but my interaction with folks is at the core of fear\n\n35:35.860 --> 35:39.900\n that folks had is for their children.\n\n35:39.900 --> 35:44.900\n Like that somehow I don't wanna get infected\n\n35:46.060 --> 35:47.900\n because of the kids.\n\n35:47.900 --> 35:50.780\n Because God forbid something happens to the kids.\n\n35:50.780 --> 35:54.520\n And I think that obviously that makes a lot of sense\n\n35:54.520 --> 35:57.480\n this kind of the kids come first no matter what,\n\n35:57.480 --> 35:58.660\n that's number one priority.\n\n35:58.660 --> 36:02.000\n But for this particular virus,\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.860\n that reasoning was not grounded in data, it seems like,\n\n36:05.860 --> 36:09.460\n or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data.\n\n36:09.460 --> 36:12.260\n But at the same time, this is way more deadly than the flu\n\n36:12.260 --> 36:15.540\n just overall, and especially to older people.\n\n36:15.540 --> 36:16.500\n Yes.\n\n36:16.500 --> 36:17.340\n Right, so.\n\n36:17.340 --> 36:21.220\n The numbers, when the story is all said and done,\n\n36:21.220 --> 36:24.060\n COVID would take many more lives.\n\n36:24.060 --> 36:27.380\n Yeah, so, I mean, 0.2 sounds like a small number,\n\n36:27.380 --> 36:29.620\n but it's not a small number worldwide.\n\n36:29.620 --> 36:31.520\n What do you think that number will be\n\n36:31.520 --> 36:34.160\n by the, you know, that's not like me,\n\n36:34.160 --> 36:37.220\n but would we cross, I think it's in the United States,\n\n36:37.220 --> 36:40.700\n it's the way the deaths are currently reported,\n\n36:40.700 --> 36:42.700\n it's like 800,000, something like that.\n\n36:42.700 --> 36:44.420\n Do you think we'll cross a million?\n\n36:44.420 --> 36:46.660\n Seems likely, yeah.\n\n36:46.660 --> 36:49.060\n Do you think it's something that might continue\n\n36:49.060 --> 36:50.820\n with different variants, what?\n\n36:50.820 --> 36:53.460\n Well, I think, so we can talk about the end state of COVID.\n\n36:53.460 --> 36:56.020\n The end state of COVID is it's here forever.\n\n36:56.020 --> 37:01.020\n I think that there is good evidence of immunity\n\n37:01.020 --> 37:05.660\n after infection, such that you're protected\n\n37:05.660 --> 37:08.540\n both against reinfection and also against\n\n37:08.540 --> 37:11.340\n severe disease upon reinfection.\n\n37:11.340 --> 37:13.940\n So the second time you get it, it's not true for everyone,\n\n37:13.940 --> 37:15.660\n but for many people, the second time you get it\n\n37:15.660 --> 37:18.620\n will be milder, much milder than the first time you get it.\n\n37:18.620 --> 37:22.720\n With the long tail, like that lasts for a long time.\n\n37:22.720 --> 37:26.100\n Yeah, so just, there are studies that follow, of course,\n\n37:26.100 --> 37:28.340\n people who are infected for a year,\n\n37:28.340 --> 37:30.420\n and the reinfection rate is something like\n\n37:30.420 --> 37:33.820\n somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.\n\n37:33.820 --> 37:36.260\n And like a pretty fantastic study out in Italy\n\n37:36.260 --> 37:38.780\n has found that, there's one in Sweden, I think,\n\n37:38.780 --> 37:41.820\n there's a few studies that have found similar things.\n\n37:41.820 --> 37:46.820\n And the reinfections tend to produce much milder disease,\n\n37:46.940 --> 37:48.420\n much less likely to end up in the hospital,\n\n37:48.420 --> 37:50.100\n much less likely to die.\n\n37:50.100 --> 37:52.540\n So what the end state of COVID is,\n\n37:52.540 --> 37:54.580\n it's circulating the population forever\n\n37:54.580 --> 37:56.500\n and you get it multiple times.\n\n37:56.500 --> 38:00.980\n Yeah, and then there's, I think, studies and discussions\n\n38:00.980 --> 38:04.300\n like the best protection would be to get it\n\n38:04.300 --> 38:06.220\n and then also to get vaccinated.\n\n38:06.220 --> 38:08.740\n And then a lot of people push back against that\n\n38:08.740 --> 38:10.700\n for the obvious reasons from both sides,\n\n38:10.700 --> 38:13.060\n because somehow the discourse has become\n\n38:13.060 --> 38:14.820\n less scientific and more political.\n\n38:14.820 --> 38:18.100\n Well, I think you wanna, the first time you meet it\n\n38:18.100 --> 38:20.300\n is gonna be the most deadly for you.\n\n38:20.300 --> 38:21.540\n And so the first time you meet it,\n\n38:21.540 --> 38:22.780\n it's just wise to be vaccinated.\n\n38:22.780 --> 38:25.420\n The vaccine reduces severe disease.\n\n38:25.420 --> 38:27.700\n Yeah, we'll talk about the vaccine,\n\n38:27.700 --> 38:30.100\n because I wanna make sure I address it carefully\n\n38:30.100 --> 38:32.720\n and properly and in full context.\n\n38:35.020 --> 38:38.060\n But yes, sort of to add to the context,\n\n38:38.060 --> 38:40.380\n a lot of the fascinating discussions we're having\n\n38:40.380 --> 38:43.060\n is in the early days of COVID\n\n38:43.060 --> 38:46.460\n and now for people who are unvaccinated.\n\n38:46.460 --> 38:49.060\n That's where the interesting story is.\n\n38:49.060 --> 38:52.740\n The policy story, the sociological story and so on.\n\n38:52.740 --> 38:55.940\n But let me go to something really fascinating\n\n38:55.940 --> 38:57.940\n just because of the people involved,\n\n38:57.940 --> 38:59.260\n the human beings involved,\n\n38:59.260 --> 39:03.020\n and because of how deeply I care about science\n\n39:03.020 --> 39:07.740\n and also kindness, respect and love and human things.\n\n39:07.740 --> 39:12.380\n Francis Collins wrote a letter in October 2020\n\n39:12.380 --> 39:14.960\n to Anthony Fauci and I think somebody else.\n\n39:15.940 --> 39:20.940\n I have the letter, oh, it's not a letter, email, I apologize.\n\n39:20.940 --> 39:25.940\n Hi, Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org.\n\n39:29.500 --> 39:32.940\n This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration\n\n39:32.940 --> 39:34.940\n that you're a coauthor on.\n\n39:34.940 --> 39:38.620\n This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists\n\n39:38.620 --> 39:40.120\n who met with the secretary\n\n39:40.120 --> 39:42.180\n seem to be getting a lot of attention\n\n39:42.180 --> 39:45.940\n and even a co signature from Nobel Prize winner,\n\n39:45.940 --> 39:48.700\n Mike Levitt at Stanford.\n\n39:48.700 --> 39:51.180\n There needs to be a quick and devastating\n\n39:51.180 --> 39:54.820\n published take down of its premises.\n\n39:54.820 --> 39:57.980\n I don't see anything like that online yet.\n\n39:57.980 --> 40:00.460\n Is it underway, question mark, Francis.\n\n40:00.460 --> 40:03.340\n Francis Collins, director of the NIH,\n\n40:03.340 --> 40:06.140\n somebody I talked to on this podcast recently.\n\n40:06.140 --> 40:09.660\n Okay, a million questions I wanna ask.\n\n40:09.660 --> 40:12.620\n But first, how did that make you feel\n\n40:12.620 --> 40:17.620\n when you first saw this email come to light,\n\n40:17.620 --> 40:20.940\n when did it come to light?\n\n40:20.940 --> 40:22.860\n This week, actually, I think, or last week.\n\n40:22.860 --> 40:25.620\n Okay, so this is because of freedom of information.\n\n40:25.620 --> 40:26.460\n Yeah.\n\n40:26.460 --> 40:30.180\n Which, by the way, sort of maybe,\n\n40:30.180 --> 40:32.140\n because I do wanna add positive stuff\n\n40:32.140 --> 40:34.100\n on the side of Francis here.\n\n40:36.220 --> 40:37.860\n Boy, when I see stuff like that,\n\n40:37.860 --> 40:42.860\n I wonder if all my emails leaked, how much embarrassing stuff.\n\n40:43.020 --> 40:45.140\n Like, I think I'm a good person,\n\n40:45.140 --> 40:49.300\n but I haven't read my old emails.\n\n40:49.300 --> 40:53.260\n Maybe, I'm pretty sure sometimes I could be an asshole.\n\n40:53.260 --> 40:54.980\n Well, I mean, look, he's a Christian,\n\n40:54.980 --> 40:57.060\n and I'm a Christian, I'm supposed to forgive, right?\n\n40:57.060 --> 41:00.060\n I mean, I think he was looking at this\n\n41:01.500 --> 41:03.780\n Great Barrington Declaration as a political problem\n\n41:03.780 --> 41:07.340\n to be solved, as opposed to a serious\n\n41:07.340 --> 41:09.980\n alternative approach to the epidemic.\n\n41:09.980 --> 41:12.280\n So maybe we'll talk about it in more detail,\n\n41:12.280 --> 41:15.020\n but just in case people are not familiar,\n\n41:15.020 --> 41:18.900\n Great Barrington Declaration was a document\n\n41:18.900 --> 41:22.300\n that you coauthored that basically argues\n\n41:22.300 --> 41:26.220\n against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID,\n\n41:26.220 --> 41:29.420\n and you propose another solution that we'll talk about.\n\n41:29.420 --> 41:34.420\n But the point is, it's not that dramatic of a document,\n\n41:34.860 --> 41:36.920\n it is just a document that criticizes\n\n41:36.920 --> 41:38.940\n one policy solution that was proposed.\n\n41:38.940 --> 41:41.180\n But it was the policy solution that had been put forward\n\n41:41.180 --> 41:44.900\n by Dr. Collins and by Tony Fauci,\n\n41:44.900 --> 41:48.060\n and a few other science, I mean, I think a relatively\n\n41:48.060 --> 41:50.760\n small number of scientists and epidemiologists\n\n41:50.760 --> 41:55.760\n in charge of the advice given to governments worldwide.\n\n41:56.700 --> 42:00.060\n And it was a challenge to that policy\n\n42:00.060 --> 42:02.940\n that said that, look, there is an alternate path,\n\n42:02.940 --> 42:06.080\n that the path we've chosen, this path of lockdown\n\n42:06.080 --> 42:09.020\n with the aim to suppress the virus to zero effectively,\n\n42:09.020 --> 42:11.060\n I mean, that was unstated.\n\n42:11.060 --> 42:14.620\n Cannot work and is causing catastrophic harm\n\n42:14.620 --> 42:17.840\n to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide.\n\n42:19.300 --> 42:23.500\n We put this out in October 4th, I think, of 2020,\n\n42:23.500 --> 42:25.700\n and it went viral.\n\n42:25.700 --> 42:27.140\n I mean, I've never actually been involved\n\n42:27.140 --> 42:28.940\n with anything like this,\n\n42:28.940 --> 42:31.580\n where I just put the document on the web,\n\n42:31.580 --> 42:34.260\n and tens of thousands of doctors signed on,\n\n42:34.260 --> 42:37.200\n hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on.\n\n42:37.200 --> 42:40.220\n It really struck a chord of people,\n\n42:40.220 --> 42:41.940\n because I think even by October of 2020,\n\n42:41.940 --> 42:45.160\n people had this sense that there was something really wrong\n\n42:45.160 --> 42:48.180\n with the COVID policy that we've been following.\n\n42:48.180 --> 42:52.140\n And they were looking for reasonable people\n\n42:52.140 --> 42:52.980\n to give an alternative.\n\n42:52.980 --> 42:56.100\n I mean, we're not arguing that COVID isn't a serious thing.\n\n42:56.100 --> 42:57.620\n I mean, it is a very serious thing.\n\n42:57.620 --> 43:01.160\n This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it.\n\n43:03.260 --> 43:05.740\n But we were saying that the policy we're following\n\n43:05.740 --> 43:06.960\n is not the right one.\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:11.960\n So how does a democratic government deal with that challenge?\n\n43:12.960 --> 43:14.880\n So to me, that, you asked me how I felt.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:16.720\n I was actually, frankly, just,\n\n43:16.720 --> 43:19.760\n I suspected there'd been some email exchanges like that,\n\n43:19.760 --> 43:21.920\n not necessarily from Francis Collins,\n\n43:21.920 --> 43:24.960\n around the government around this time.\n\n43:24.960 --> 43:27.960\n I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign\n\n43:29.280 --> 43:31.280\n almost immediately after we published it,\n\n43:31.280 --> 43:34.080\n where newspapers mischaracterized it\n\n43:34.080 --> 43:37.960\n in the same way over and over and over again,\n\n43:39.280 --> 43:41.560\n and sought to characterize me\n\n43:41.560 --> 43:45.920\n as sort of a marginal fringe figure or whatnot.\n\n43:45.920 --> 43:47.640\n Sunetra Gupta, Martin Kulldorff,\n\n43:47.640 --> 43:50.360\n or the tens of thousands of other people that signed it.\n\n43:50.360 --> 43:53.560\n I felt the brunt of that all year long.\n\n43:53.560 --> 43:56.240\n So to see this in black and white,\n\n43:56.240 --> 43:58.680\n in the handwriting, essentially,\n\n43:58.680 --> 44:01.040\n I mean, the metaphorical handwriting of Francis Collins\n\n44:01.040 --> 44:02.320\n was actually, frankly, a disappointment,\n\n44:02.320 --> 44:05.320\n because I've looked up to him for years.\n\n44:05.320 --> 44:07.640\n Yeah, I've looked up to him as well.\n\n44:07.640 --> 44:12.160\n I mean, I look for the best in people,\n\n44:12.160 --> 44:15.320\n and I still look up to him.\n\n44:15.320 --> 44:17.280\n What troubles me is several things.\n\n44:19.560 --> 44:23.200\n The reason I said about the asshole emails\n\n44:23.200 --> 44:28.200\n I send late at night is I can understand this email.\n\n44:28.200 --> 44:33.200\n It's fear, it's panic, not being sure.\n\n44:34.120 --> 44:37.440\n The fringe, three fringe epidemiologists.\n\n44:37.440 --> 44:40.520\n Plus Mike Leavitt, who won a Nobel Prize, I mean.\n\n44:40.520 --> 44:45.440\n But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts,\n\n44:45.440 --> 44:47.920\n I have said things like that about others,\n\n44:47.920 --> 44:50.360\n like a little bit too unkind.\n\n44:50.360 --> 44:52.320\n Like, you don't really mean it.\n\n44:52.320 --> 44:56.120\n Now, add to that, he recently, this week,\n\n44:56.120 --> 45:00.280\n whatever, doubled down on the fringe.\n\n45:00.280 --> 45:02.520\n This is really troubling to me,\n\n45:02.520 --> 45:04.960\n that I can excuse this email,\n\n45:04.960 --> 45:09.960\n but the arrogance there, Francis, honestly,\n\n45:10.000 --> 45:12.720\n I mean, broke my heart a little bit there.\n\n45:12.720 --> 45:16.120\n This was an opportunity to, especially at this stage,\n\n45:16.120 --> 45:18.880\n to say, just like I told him,\n\n45:20.400 --> 45:23.720\n to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.\n\n45:23.720 --> 45:27.360\n I was wrong to not be open to ideas.\n\n45:27.360 --> 45:29.640\n I still believe that this is not,\n\n45:29.640 --> 45:33.720\n like, say, like, actually argue with the proposal,\n\n45:33.720 --> 45:36.240\n with the policy, the proposed solution.\n\n45:36.240 --> 45:41.160\n Also, the devastating published,\n\n45:41.160 --> 45:45.840\n devastating takedown, devastating takedown.\n\n45:45.840 --> 45:50.840\n As you say, somebody who's sitting on billions of dollars\n\n45:50.840 --> 45:54.640\n that they're giving to scientists,\n\n45:54.640 --> 45:58.080\n some of whom are often not their best human beings\n\n45:58.080 --> 46:00.640\n because they're fighting with each other over money,\n\n46:00.640 --> 46:02.440\n not being cognizant of the fact\n\n46:02.440 --> 46:06.600\n that you're challenging the integrity,\n\n46:06.600 --> 46:08.800\n you're corrupting the integrity of scientists\n\n46:08.800 --> 46:10.800\n by allocating them money,\n\n46:10.800 --> 46:13.440\n you're now playing with that\n\n46:13.440 --> 46:15.960\n by saying devastating takedown.\n\n46:15.960 --> 46:19.600\n Where do you think the published takedown will come from?\n\n46:19.600 --> 46:21.560\n It will come from those scientists\n\n46:21.560 --> 46:23.320\n to whom you're giving money.\n\n46:23.320 --> 46:25.400\n What kind of example would they give\n\n46:25.400 --> 46:28.760\n to the academic community that thrives on freedom?\n\n46:28.760 --> 46:33.760\n Like, this is, I believe Francis Collins is a great man.\n\n46:34.560 --> 46:36.680\n One of the things I was troubled by\n\n46:36.680 --> 46:38.920\n is the negative response to him\n\n46:38.920 --> 46:40.800\n from people that don't understand\n\n46:40.800 --> 46:44.040\n the positive impact that NIH has had on society,\n\n46:44.040 --> 46:45.880\n how many people it's helped.\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:50.000\n But this is exactly the, so he's not just a scientist.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:53.440\n He's not just a bureaucrat who distributes money.\n\n46:53.440 --> 46:55.720\n He's also a scientific leader\n\n46:55.720 --> 46:58.800\n that in difficult times we live in,\n\n46:58.800 --> 47:01.360\n is supposed to inspire us with trust,\n\n47:01.360 --> 47:04.880\n with love, with the freedom of thought.\n\n47:04.880 --> 47:08.680\n He's supposed to, you know those fringe epidemiologists?\n\n47:08.680 --> 47:10.880\n Those are the heroes of science.\n\n47:10.880 --> 47:13.400\n When you look at the long arc of history,\n\n47:13.400 --> 47:15.560\n we love those people.\n\n47:15.560 --> 47:18.400\n We love ideas, even when they get proven wrong.\n\n47:18.400 --> 47:20.240\n That's what always attracted me to science.\n\n47:20.240 --> 47:23.720\n Like somebody, the lone voice saying,\n\n47:23.720 --> 47:26.960\n oh no, the moon of Jupiter does move.\n\n47:29.320 --> 47:30.720\n But the funny thing is,\n\n47:30.720 --> 47:32.760\n Galileo was saying something truly revolutionary.\n\n47:32.760 --> 47:34.920\n We were saying that what we proposed\n\n47:34.920 --> 47:35.840\n in the Great Barbarian Declaration\n\n47:35.840 --> 47:38.880\n was actually just the old pandemic plan.\n\n47:38.880 --> 47:42.120\n It wasn't anything really fundamentally novel.\n\n47:42.120 --> 47:46.320\n In fact, there were plans like this\n\n47:46.320 --> 47:49.680\n that lockdown scientists had written\n\n47:49.680 --> 47:52.680\n in late February, early March of 2020.\n\n47:52.680 --> 47:54.400\n So we were not saying anything radical.\n\n47:54.400 --> 47:57.120\n We were just calling for a debate effectively\n\n47:57.120 --> 47:59.760\n over the existing lockdown policy.\n\n48:00.880 --> 48:02.600\n And this is a disappointment,\n\n48:02.600 --> 48:04.720\n a really, truly a big disappointment\n\n48:04.720 --> 48:08.400\n because by doing this, you were absolutely right, Lex.\n\n48:08.400 --> 48:12.280\n He sent a signal to so many other scientists\n\n48:12.280 --> 48:15.160\n to just stay silent, even if you had reservations.\n\n48:15.160 --> 48:18.360\n Yeah, devastating take down that people,\n\n48:18.360 --> 48:21.280\n you know how many people wrote to me privately,\n\n48:21.280 --> 48:23.760\n like Stanford, MIT,\n\n48:23.760 --> 48:28.080\n how amazing the conversation with Francis Collins was?\n\n48:28.080 --> 48:31.840\n There's a kind of admiration because,\n\n48:31.840 --> 48:33.440\n okay, how do I put it?\n\n48:33.440 --> 48:38.440\n A lot of people get into science\n\n48:38.440 --> 48:40.480\n because they wanna help the world.\n\n48:40.480 --> 48:42.320\n They get excited by the ideas\n\n48:42.320 --> 48:46.240\n and they really are working hard to help\n\n48:46.240 --> 48:47.840\n in whatever the discipline is.\n\n48:47.840 --> 48:50.720\n And then there is sources of funding\n\n48:50.720 --> 48:53.360\n which help you do help at a larger scale.\n\n48:53.360 --> 48:58.280\n So you admire the people that are distributing the money\n\n48:58.280 --> 49:01.320\n because they're often, at least on the surface,\n\n49:01.320 --> 49:02.800\n are really also good people.\n\n49:02.800 --> 49:04.760\n Oftentimes they're great scientists.\n\n49:04.760 --> 49:06.800\n So like, it's amazing.\n\n49:06.800 --> 49:08.480\n That's why I'm sort of,\n\n49:10.640 --> 49:12.200\n like sometimes people from outside\n\n49:12.200 --> 49:14.520\n think academia is broken some kind of way.\n\n49:14.520 --> 49:16.320\n No, it's a beautiful thing.\n\n49:16.320 --> 49:17.960\n It really is a beautiful thing.\n\n49:17.960 --> 49:19.840\n And that's why it's so deeply heartbreaking\n\n49:19.840 --> 49:23.760\n where this person is,\n\n49:23.760 --> 49:26.440\n I don't think this is malevolence.\n\n49:26.440 --> 49:31.160\n I think he's just incompetence of communication twice.\n\n49:31.160 --> 49:34.080\n I think there's also arrogance at the bottom of it too.\n\n49:34.080 --> 49:36.400\n But all of us have arrogance at the bottom.\n\n49:36.400 --> 49:38.000\n There's a particular kind of arrogance.\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.800\n So here it's of the same kind of arrogance\n\n49:40.800 --> 49:43.280\n that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV\n\n49:43.280 --> 49:46.560\n and says that if you criticize me,\n\n49:46.560 --> 49:48.440\n you're not simply criticizing a man,\n\n49:48.440 --> 49:51.080\n you're criticizing science itself.\n\n49:51.080 --> 49:55.000\n That is at the heart also of this email.\n\n49:55.000 --> 49:59.480\n The certainty that the policies that they were recommending,\n\n49:59.480 --> 50:01.080\n Collins and Fauci were recommending\n\n50:01.080 --> 50:03.480\n to the president of the United States were right.\n\n50:03.480 --> 50:06.480\n Not just right, but right so far right\n\n50:06.480 --> 50:09.480\n that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous.\n\n50:11.000 --> 50:13.680\n And I think that is really the heart of that email.\n\n50:13.680 --> 50:18.680\n It's this idea that my position is unchallengeable.\n\n50:19.840 --> 50:22.800\n Now to be completely, to be as charitable as I can be\n\n50:22.800 --> 50:25.720\n to this, I believe they thought that.\n\n50:25.720 --> 50:27.760\n I believe some of them still think that,\n\n50:27.760 --> 50:31.840\n that there was only one true policy possible\n\n50:31.840 --> 50:32.680\n in response to COVID.\n\n50:32.680 --> 50:35.120\n Every other policy was immoral.\n\n50:36.240 --> 50:37.840\n And if you come from that position,\n\n50:37.840 --> 50:39.160\n then you write an email like that.\n\n50:39.160 --> 50:42.600\n You go on TV, you say effectively la science est moi, right?\n\n50:42.600 --> 50:44.560\n I mean, that is what happens\n\n50:44.560 --> 50:47.720\n when you have this sort of unchallengeable arrogance\n\n50:47.720 --> 50:50.040\n that the policy you're following is correct.\n\n50:50.040 --> 50:52.240\n I mean, when we wrote the Great Bank Declaration,\n\n50:52.240 --> 50:55.720\n what I was hoping for was a discussion\n\n50:55.720 --> 50:57.760\n about how to protect the vulnerable.\n\n50:57.760 --> 51:00.000\n I mean, that was the key idea to me in the whole thing\n\n51:00.000 --> 51:02.960\n was better protection of the older population\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:04.920\n who were really at really serious risk\n\n51:04.920 --> 51:06.280\n if infected with COVID.\n\n51:06.280 --> 51:08.640\n And we had been doing a very poor job, I thought,\n\n51:08.640 --> 51:11.240\n to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable.\n\n51:12.320 --> 51:16.600\n And what I wanted was a discussion by local public health\n\n51:16.600 --> 51:18.800\n about better methods, better policies\n\n51:18.800 --> 51:20.080\n to protect the vulnerable.\n\n51:20.080 --> 51:25.080\n So when we were met with instead a series\n\n51:25.080 --> 51:27.320\n of essentially propagandist lies about it.\n\n51:27.320 --> 51:31.680\n So for instance, I kept hearing from reporters in those days,\n\n51:31.680 --> 51:33.480\n why do you want to let the virus rip?\n\n51:33.480 --> 51:34.560\n Let it rip, let it rip.\n\n51:34.560 --> 51:37.960\n The words let it rip does not appear\n\n51:37.960 --> 51:40.360\n in the Great Bank Declaration.\n\n51:40.360 --> 51:42.760\n The goal isn't to let the virus rip.\n\n51:42.760 --> 51:45.000\n The goal is to protect the vulnerable,\n\n51:45.000 --> 51:49.520\n to let society go open schools and do other things\n\n51:49.520 --> 51:51.120\n that function as best it can\n\n51:51.120 --> 51:54.000\n in the midst of a terrible pandemic, yes,\n\n51:54.000 --> 51:56.200\n but not let the virus rip\n\n51:56.200 --> 51:58.680\n where the most vulnerable aren't protected.\n\n51:58.680 --> 52:00.360\n The goal was to protect the vulnerable.\n\n52:00.360 --> 52:01.600\n So why let it rip?\n\n52:01.600 --> 52:03.680\n Because it was a propaganda term\n\n52:03.680 --> 52:06.680\n to hit the fear centers of people's brains.\n\n52:06.680 --> 52:08.200\n Oh, these people are immoral.\n\n52:08.200 --> 52:09.800\n They just want to let the virus go through society\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:11.080\n and hurt everybody.\n\n52:11.080 --> 52:12.920\n That was the idea.\n\n52:12.920 --> 52:15.400\n It was a way to preclude a discussion\n\n52:15.400 --> 52:19.640\n and preclude a debate about the existing policy.\n\n52:19.640 --> 52:23.360\n So this is an app called Clubhouse.\n\n52:23.360 --> 52:28.360\n I've gone back on it recently to practice Russian,\n\n52:28.600 --> 52:32.560\n unrelated for a few big Russian conversations coming up.\n\n52:32.560 --> 52:33.600\n Anyway, it's a great way\n\n52:33.600 --> 52:35.520\n to talk to regular people in Russian.\n\n52:35.520 --> 52:37.920\n But I also, I was nervous.\n\n52:37.920 --> 52:40.280\n I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation\n\n52:40.280 --> 52:43.080\n and there was a vaccine room and so I joined it.\n\n52:43.080 --> 52:48.080\n And it was a pro science room.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:50.080\n These are like scientists\n\n52:50.080 --> 52:52.720\n that were calling each other pro science.\n\n52:52.720 --> 52:55.400\n The whole thing was like theater to me.\n\n52:55.400 --> 52:57.200\n I mean, I haven't thoroughly researched,\n\n52:57.200 --> 52:58.240\n but looking at the resume,\n\n52:58.240 --> 53:03.240\n they were like pretty solid researchers and doctors.\n\n53:04.080 --> 53:09.080\n And they were mocking everybody who was at all,\n\n53:10.120 --> 53:11.840\n I mean, it doesn't matter what they stood for,\n\n53:11.840 --> 53:13.240\n but they were just mocking people\n\n53:13.240 --> 53:15.880\n and the arrogance was overwhelming.\n\n53:15.880 --> 53:18.920\n I had to shut off because I couldn't handle\n\n53:18.920 --> 53:21.440\n that human beings can be like this to each other.\n\n53:21.440 --> 53:24.480\n And then I went back just to double check,\n\n53:24.480 --> 53:25.480\n is this really happening?\n\n53:25.480 --> 53:26.920\n How many people are here?\n\n53:26.920 --> 53:28.440\n Is this theater?\n\n53:28.440 --> 53:31.520\n And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse\n\n53:31.520 --> 53:32.720\n to make a couple of comments.\n\n53:32.720 --> 53:36.200\n And then as I opened my mouth, I said, thank you so much.\n\n53:36.200 --> 53:39.920\n This is a great room, sort of the usual civil politeness,\n\n53:39.920 --> 53:41.720\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n53:41.720 --> 53:46.720\n And I said, I'm worried that the kind of arrogance\n\n53:47.780 --> 53:51.560\n with which things are being discussed here\n\n53:51.560 --> 53:55.440\n will further divide us, not unite us.\n\n53:55.440 --> 54:00.440\n And before I said even the unite us, further divide us,\n\n54:00.460 --> 54:02.300\n I was thrown off stage.\n\n54:02.300 --> 54:04.340\n Now, this isn't why I mentioned platform,\n\n54:04.340 --> 54:08.880\n but like I am like Lex Friedman, MIT,\n\n54:08.880 --> 54:11.960\n also, which is something those people seem\n\n54:11.960 --> 54:15.760\n to sometimes care about, followers and stuff like that.\n\n54:15.760 --> 54:18.200\n Like, did you just do that?\n\n54:18.200 --> 54:21.100\n And then they said, enough of that nonsense.\n\n54:21.100 --> 54:22.760\n Enough of that nonsense.\n\n54:22.760 --> 54:27.420\n They said to me, enough of that nonsense.\n\n54:27.420 --> 54:31.540\n Somebody who is obviously interviewed, Francis Collins,\n\n54:31.540 --> 54:35.040\n is the Pfizer CEO.\n\n54:35.040 --> 54:37.780\n To bring you on, French epidemiologist also, so just.\n\n54:37.780 --> 54:38.780\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n54:38.780 --> 54:40.760\n But this broke my heart, the arrogance.\n\n54:40.760 --> 54:43.160\n And this is, echoes of that arrogance\n\n54:43.160 --> 54:44.520\n is something you see in this email.\n\n54:44.520 --> 54:47.000\n And I really would love to have a million things\n\n54:47.000 --> 54:48.600\n to talk about to try to figure out\n\n54:48.600 --> 54:50.420\n how can we find a path forward?\n\n54:50.420 --> 54:54.240\n I think a lot of the problems we've seen\n\n54:54.240 --> 54:57.000\n in the discussion over COVID,\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:59.600\n and especially in the scientific community,\n\n54:59.600 --> 55:02.400\n there's two ways to look at science, I think,\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:05.240\n that have been competing with each other for a while now.\n\n55:05.240 --> 55:08.800\n One way, and this is the way that I view science\n\n55:08.800 --> 55:10.920\n and why I've always found it so attractive,\n\n55:10.920 --> 55:14.200\n is an invitation to a structured discussion\n\n55:14.200 --> 55:18.080\n where the discussion is tempered by evidence,\n\n55:18.080 --> 55:22.040\n by data, by reasoning and logic, right?\n\n55:22.040 --> 55:25.240\n So it's a dialectical process where if I believe A\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:29.560\n and you believe B, well, we talk about it.\n\n55:29.560 --> 55:30.760\n We come up with an experiment\n\n55:30.760 --> 55:32.640\n that distinguishes between the two.\n\n55:32.640 --> 55:34.920\n And while B turns out to be right,\n\n55:34.920 --> 55:37.100\n I'm all frustrated, but I buy you dinner\n\n55:37.100 --> 55:38.480\n and I say, no, no, no, no, C.\n\n55:38.480 --> 55:40.880\n And then we go on from there, right?\n\n55:40.880 --> 55:43.320\n That's what science is at its best.\n\n55:43.320 --> 55:46.400\n It's this process of using data in discussion.\n\n55:46.400 --> 55:48.680\n It's a human activity, right?\n\n55:48.680 --> 55:53.680\n To learn, to have the truth unfold itself before us.\n\n55:54.200 --> 55:57.380\n On the other hand, there's another way\n\n55:57.380 --> 55:59.800\n that people have used science or thought about science\n\n55:59.800 --> 56:03.360\n as truth in and of itself, right?\n\n56:03.360 --> 56:07.080\n Like if it's science, therefore it's true automatically.\n\n56:07.080 --> 56:10.320\n And what does the science say to do?\n\n56:10.320 --> 56:12.280\n Well, the science never says to do anything.\n\n56:12.280 --> 56:13.760\n The science says, here's what's true.\n\n56:13.760 --> 56:17.840\n And then we have to apply our human values to say,\n\n56:17.840 --> 56:21.880\n okay, well, if we do this, then this is likely to happen.\n\n56:21.880 --> 56:23.100\n That's what the science says.\n\n56:23.100 --> 56:25.080\n If we do that, then that is likely to happen.\n\n56:25.080 --> 56:27.520\n Well, we'd rather have this than that, right?\n\n56:27.520 --> 56:29.420\n But science doesn't tell us\n\n56:29.420 --> 56:30.440\n that we'd rather have this than that.\n\n56:30.440 --> 56:31.700\n It's our human values that tell us\n\n56:31.700 --> 56:32.560\n that we'd rather have this than that.\n\n56:32.560 --> 56:35.120\n Science plays a role, but it's not the only thing.\n\n56:36.040 --> 56:36.920\n It's not the only role.\n\n56:36.920 --> 56:40.120\n It's like, it helps understand the constraints we face,\n\n56:40.120 --> 56:41.600\n but it doesn't tell us what to do\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:43.260\n in face of those constraints.\n\n56:43.260 --> 56:45.640\n But underneath it, at the individual level,\n\n56:45.640 --> 56:46.840\n at the institutional level,\n\n56:46.840 --> 56:51.840\n it seems like arrogance is really destructive.\n\n56:52.640 --> 56:55.800\n So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility.\n\n56:55.800 --> 57:02.800\n So sort of always not being sure that you're right.\n\n57:03.060 --> 57:05.120\n This is actually kind of,\n\n57:05.120 --> 57:07.720\n Stuart Russell talks about this for AI research.\n\n57:07.720 --> 57:09.480\n How do you make sure that AI,\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:11.360\n super intelligent AI doesn't destroy us?\n\n57:11.360 --> 57:15.400\n You built in a sort of module within it\n\n57:15.400 --> 57:18.560\n that it always doubts its actions.\n\n57:18.560 --> 57:20.160\n Like, it's not sure.\n\n57:20.160 --> 57:23.200\n Like, I know it says I'm supposed to destroy all humans,\n\n57:23.200 --> 57:24.800\n but maybe I'm wrong.\n\n57:24.800 --> 57:27.860\n And that maybe I'm wrong is essential for progress,\n\n57:27.860 --> 57:30.840\n for actually doing in the long arc of history better,\n\n57:30.840 --> 57:31.760\n not the perfect thing,\n\n57:31.760 --> 57:33.480\n but better and better and better and better.\n\n57:33.480 --> 57:37.840\n I mean, the question I have here for you is this,\n\n57:37.840 --> 57:41.920\n this email so clearly captures some maybe echo,\n\n57:41.920 --> 57:44.240\n but maybe a core to the problem.\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:47.040\n Do you put responsibility of this email,\n\n57:47.040 --> 57:49.920\n of the shortcomings and failures\n\n57:49.920 --> 57:52.060\n on individuals or institutions?\n\n57:52.060 --> 57:53.680\n Is this Francis Collins, Anthony?\n\n57:53.680 --> 57:55.320\n No, this is an institutional failure, right?\n\n57:55.320 --> 57:59.180\n So the NIH, so I've had two decades of NIH funding.\n\n57:59.180 --> 58:01.200\n I've sat on NIH review panels.\n\n58:01.200 --> 58:03.800\n The purpose of the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex.\n\n58:03.800 --> 58:08.080\n The purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.\n\n58:08.080 --> 58:10.640\n To some extent, it's also to help scientists,\n\n58:10.640 --> 58:12.760\n to direct scientists to work on things\n\n58:12.760 --> 58:14.520\n that are very important for public health\n\n58:14.520 --> 58:16.120\n or for the health of the public.\n\n58:17.160 --> 58:18.740\n So, and the way you do that is you say,\n\n58:18.740 --> 58:21.600\n okay, we're gonna put $50 million\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:24.480\n on the research in Alzheimer's disease this year\n\n58:24.480 --> 58:27.240\n or $70 million on HIV or whatever it is, right?\n\n58:27.240 --> 58:30.920\n And that pot of money then scientists compete\n\n58:30.920 --> 58:33.440\n with each other for the best ideas to use it\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:36.140\n to address that problem.\n\n58:36.140 --> 58:38.400\n So it's essentially an endeavor\n\n58:38.400 --> 58:40.320\n to support the work of scientists.\n\n58:40.320 --> 58:45.060\n It is not in and of itself a policy organ.\n\n58:45.060 --> 58:48.240\n It doesn't say what public health policy should be.\n\n58:48.240 --> 58:53.240\n For that, you have the CDC and what happened\n\n58:53.940 --> 58:58.660\n during the pandemic is that people in the NIH\n\n58:58.660 --> 59:01.620\n were called upon to contribute\n\n59:01.620 --> 59:03.720\n to public health policymaking.\n\n59:04.860 --> 59:06.860\n And that created the conflict of interest\n\n59:06.860 --> 59:09.020\n you see in that email, right?\n\n59:09.020 --> 59:13.780\n So now you have the head of the NIH in effect saying\n\n59:13.780 --> 59:17.020\n to all scientists, you must agree with me\n\n59:17.020 --> 59:19.020\n in the policy that I've recommended\n\n59:20.900 --> 59:22.100\n or else you're a fringe.\n\n59:23.580 --> 59:25.300\n That is a deep conflict of interest.\n\n59:25.300 --> 59:27.420\n It's deep because first he's conflicted.\n\n59:27.420 --> 59:31.580\n He has this dual role as the head of the NIH,\n\n59:31.580 --> 59:33.060\n supporter of scientific funding\n\n59:33.060 --> 59:35.900\n and then also inappropriately called\n\n59:35.900 --> 59:39.420\n to set or help set pandemic policy.\n\n59:39.420 --> 59:40.860\n That should never have happened.\n\n59:40.860 --> 59:44.340\n There should be a bright line between those two roles.\n\n59:44.340 --> 59:47.180\n Let me ask you about just Francis Collins.\n\n59:47.180 --> 59:49.820\n I had a chance to talk to him on a podcast.\n\n59:49.820 --> 59:51.140\n I don't know if you maybe by chance\n\n59:51.140 --> 59:52.780\n gotten a chance to hear a few words.\n\n59:52.780 --> 59:54.400\n I heard some of it, yeah.\n\n59:54.400 --> 59:56.760\n Well, I have kind of a question to that\n\n59:56.760 --> 1:00:01.380\n because a lot of people wrote to me quite negative things\n\n1:00:01.380 --> 1:00:03.420\n about Francis Collins and like I said,\n\n1:00:03.420 --> 1:00:06.940\n I still believe he's a great man and a great scientist.\n\n1:00:09.340 --> 1:00:13.420\n One of the things when I talked to him off mic\n\n1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:14.800\n about the vaccine,\n\n1:00:16.860 --> 1:00:21.260\n the excitement he had about when we were recollecting\n\n1:00:21.260 --> 1:00:23.540\n when they first gotten an inkling\n\n1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:26.900\n that it's actually going to be possible to get a vaccine,\n\n1:00:26.900 --> 1:00:28.900\n just he wasn't messaging,\n\n1:00:28.900 --> 1:00:31.300\n just in the private or of our own conversation,\n\n1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:34.180\n he was really excited and why was he excited?\n\n1:00:34.180 --> 1:00:36.500\n Because he gets to help a lot of people.\n\n1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:40.560\n This is a man that really wants to help people\n\n1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:43.660\n and there could be some institutional self delusion,\n\n1:00:43.660 --> 1:00:45.660\n the arrogance, all those kinds of things\n\n1:00:45.660 --> 1:00:47.220\n that lead to this kind of email.\n\n1:00:47.220 --> 1:00:49.340\n But ultimately the goal is this,\n\n1:00:49.340 --> 1:00:51.780\n I don't think people quite realize this.\n\n1:00:51.780 --> 1:00:55.060\n The reason he would call you a fringe epidemiologist,\n\n1:00:55.060 --> 1:00:58.100\n the reason there needs to be a devastating published\n\n1:00:58.100 --> 1:01:01.860\n take down, he, I believe really believes\n\n1:01:01.860 --> 1:01:05.380\n that it could be very dangerous\n\n1:01:05.380 --> 1:01:09.360\n and it's a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders\n\n1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:11.140\n because like you said, in his role\n\n1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:13.460\n where he defines some of the public policy,\n\n1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:19.020\n depending on how he thinks about the world,\n\n1:01:19.020 --> 1:01:20.300\n millions of people could die\n\n1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:22.820\n because of one decision he make.\n\n1:01:22.820 --> 1:01:24.700\n And that's a lot of burden to walk with.\n\n1:01:24.700 --> 1:01:25.940\n Yeah, no, I think that's right.\n\n1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:29.420\n I don't think that he has bad intentions.\n\n1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:31.980\n I think that he was basically put,\n\n1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:34.380\n was put or maybe put himself in a position\n\n1:01:34.380 --> 1:01:38.060\n where this kind of conflict of interest\n\n1:01:38.060 --> 1:01:42.700\n was going to create this kind of reaction, right?\n\n1:01:42.700 --> 1:01:44.540\n The kind of humility that you're calling for\n\n1:01:44.540 --> 1:01:48.100\n is almost impossible when you have that dual role\n\n1:01:48.100 --> 1:01:51.380\n that you shouldn't have as funder of science\n\n1:01:51.380 --> 1:01:53.460\n and also setter of scientific policy.\n\n1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:54.500\n I agree with everything you just said,\n\n1:01:54.500 --> 1:01:55.700\n except the last part.\n\n1:01:55.700 --> 1:01:58.100\n The humility is almost impossible.\n\n1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:01.640\n Humility is always difficult.\n\n1:02:01.640 --> 1:02:04.740\n I think there's a huge incentive\n\n1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:06.700\n for humility in that position.\n\n1:02:06.700 --> 1:02:08.520\n Now look at history.\n\n1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:13.520\n Great leaders that have humility are popular as hell.\n\n1:02:14.460 --> 1:02:16.760\n So if you like being popular,\n\n1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:19.660\n if you like having impact, legacy,\n\n1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:22.220\n these descendants of ape seem to care about legacy,\n\n1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:25.980\n especially as they get older in these high positions.\n\n1:02:25.980 --> 1:02:28.380\n I think the incentive for humility is pretty high.\n\n1:02:28.380 --> 1:02:30.340\n Well, the thing is there's a lot\n\n1:02:30.340 --> 1:02:32.300\n that he has to be proud of in his career.\n\n1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:34.540\n I mean, the Human Genome Project\n\n1:02:34.540 --> 1:02:36.260\n wouldn't have happened without him.\n\n1:02:36.260 --> 1:02:39.460\n And he is a great man and a great scientist.\n\n1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:41.660\n So it is tragic to me that his career\n\n1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:43.260\n has ended in this particular way.\n\n1:02:44.820 --> 1:02:46.060\n Can I ask you a question\n\n1:02:46.060 --> 1:02:50.700\n about my podcast conversation with him?\n\n1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:53.240\n By way of advice or maybe criticism,\n\n1:02:54.380 --> 1:02:56.260\n there's a lot of people that wrote to me\n\n1:02:56.260 --> 1:03:00.020\n kind words of support and a lot of people\n\n1:03:00.020 --> 1:03:03.340\n that wrote to me respectful, constructive criticism.\n\n1:03:03.340 --> 1:03:06.180\n How would you suggest to have conversations\n\n1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:07.820\n with folks like that?\n\n1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:11.020\n And maybe, I mean,\n\n1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:12.900\n because I have other conversations like this,\n\n1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:17.380\n including I was debating whether to talk to Anthony Fauci.\n\n1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:19.220\n He wanted to talk.\n\n1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:22.820\n And so what kind of conversation do you have?\n\n1:03:22.820 --> 1:03:24.620\n And sorry to take us on a tangent,\n\n1:03:24.620 --> 1:03:27.300\n but almost from an interview perspective\n\n1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:31.780\n of how to inspire humility and inspire trust in science\n\n1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:34.460\n or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we're doing\n\n1:03:34.460 --> 1:03:35.700\n and we're gonna figure this out?\n\n1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:38.460\n I mean, I think you're,\n\n1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:41.220\n I've had been now interviewed by many people.\n\n1:03:41.220 --> 1:03:44.460\n I think the style you have really works well, Lex.\n\n1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:45.540\n You have to,\n\n1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:48.980\n because I don't think you're gonna be ever an attack dog\n\n1:03:48.980 --> 1:03:53.260\n trying to go after somebody and force them to like,\n\n1:03:53.260 --> 1:03:55.780\n sort of admit that they were wrong or whatever about,\n\n1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:58.740\n I mean, I also actually find that form of journalism\n\n1:03:58.740 --> 1:04:00.500\n and podcasting really off putting.\n\n1:04:00.500 --> 1:04:02.180\n It's hard to watch.\n\n1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:04.100\n Also, it's a whole other tangent.\n\n1:04:04.100 --> 1:04:05.380\n Is that actually effective?\n\n1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:06.220\n I don't think so.\n\n1:04:06.220 --> 1:04:09.140\n Do you wanna ask Hitler,\n\n1:04:09.140 --> 1:04:11.020\n and I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler.\n\n1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:13.620\n I've been studying a lot about the rise and fall\n\n1:04:13.620 --> 1:04:15.140\n of the Third Reich.\n\n1:04:15.140 --> 1:04:16.660\n I think about interviewing Stalin.\n\n1:04:16.660 --> 1:04:18.540\n Like I put myself in that mindset,\n\n1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:22.700\n like how do you have conversations with people\n\n1:04:22.700 --> 1:04:24.900\n to understand who they are so that,\n\n1:04:24.900 --> 1:04:28.220\n not so you can sit there and yell at them,\n\n1:04:28.220 --> 1:04:29.340\n but to understand who they are\n\n1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:32.420\n so that you can inspire a very large number of people\n\n1:04:32.420 --> 1:04:33.940\n to be the best version of themselves\n\n1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:36.220\n and to avoid the mistakes of the past.\n\n1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:39.700\n I believe that everyone that's involved in this debate\n\n1:04:39.700 --> 1:04:41.180\n has good intentions.\n\n1:04:41.180 --> 1:04:44.060\n They're coming at it from their points of view.\n\n1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:48.180\n They have their weaknesses.\n\n1:04:48.180 --> 1:04:50.820\n And if you can paint a picture in your questioning\n\n1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:55.180\n by sympathetic questioning of those strengths and weaknesses\n\n1:04:55.180 --> 1:04:57.340\n and their point of view, you've done a service.\n\n1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.180\n That's really all I personally like to see\n\n1:05:00.180 --> 1:05:02.100\n in those kinds of interviews.\n\n1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:06.700\n I don't think a gotcha moment is really the key thing there.\n\n1:05:06.700 --> 1:05:09.340\n The key thing is understanding where they're coming from,\n\n1:05:09.340 --> 1:05:10.660\n understanding their thinking,\n\n1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:12.340\n understanding the constraints they faced\n\n1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:14.140\n and how did they manage them.\n\n1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:15.700\n That's gonna provide a much,\n\n1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:17.100\n I mean, to me, that's what I look for\n\n1:05:17.100 --> 1:05:19.860\n when I listen to podcasts like yours,\n\n1:05:19.860 --> 1:05:24.660\n is an understanding of that person and the moment\n\n1:05:24.660 --> 1:05:26.300\n and how they dealt with it.\n\n1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:30.580\n I mean, I guess the hope is to discover in a sympathetic way\n\n1:05:30.580 --> 1:05:33.820\n a flaw in a person's thinking together.\n\n1:05:33.820 --> 1:05:37.140\n Like as opposed to discovering the positive thing together,\n\n1:05:37.140 --> 1:05:39.620\n you discover the thing, well,\n\n1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:40.860\n I didn't really think about that.\n\n1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:42.940\n Yeah, I mean, that's how science is, right?\n\n1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:46.160\n That's why we find it so attractive is this,\n\n1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.160\n I like it when a student shows me I'm thinking incorrectly.\n\n1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:53.960\n Right, I'm really grateful to that student\n\n1:05:53.960 --> 1:05:57.300\n because now I have an opportunity to change my mind about it\n\n1:05:57.300 --> 1:05:58.980\n and then start thinking even more correctly.\n\n1:05:58.980 --> 1:06:02.860\n I mean, and there are moments when,\n\n1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:05.020\n I mean, like this is probably a good time to say\n\n1:06:05.020 --> 1:06:07.920\n like what I think I got wrong during the pandemic, right?\n\n1:06:07.920 --> 1:06:10.660\n So like for instance, you said Francis Collins had a moment\n\n1:06:10.660 --> 1:06:14.780\n when he learned that there was quite possible\n\n1:06:14.780 --> 1:06:16.620\n to get a vaccine going.\n\n1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:19.060\n He must've learned that quite early.\n\n1:06:19.060 --> 1:06:21.520\n And I didn't learn that early.\n\n1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:25.060\n I mean, I didn't know, in March of 2020,\n\n1:06:25.940 --> 1:06:28.140\n in my experience with vaccine development,\n\n1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:30.740\n it would've take, I thought it would take a decade or more\n\n1:06:30.740 --> 1:06:31.680\n to get a vaccine.\n\n1:06:33.020 --> 1:06:34.220\n That was wrong, right?\n\n1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:38.020\n I didn't, and I was so happy\n\n1:06:38.020 --> 1:06:40.420\n when I started to see the preliminary numbers\n\n1:06:40.420 --> 1:06:43.940\n in the Pfizer trial that strongly suggested\n\n1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:44.980\n it was going to work.\n\n1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:49.700\n And I was, I mean, like very few times in my life\n\n1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:50.980\n I'm so happy to be wrong.\n\n1:06:50.980 --> 1:06:55.480\n And it changes kind of, I think I've heard you mention\n\n1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:58.180\n that a lockdown is still a bad idea\n\n1:06:58.180 --> 1:07:01.800\n unless the vaccine comes out in like tomorrow.\n\n1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:05.300\n There's still like suffering and economic pain,\n\n1:07:05.300 --> 1:07:07.100\n all kinds of pain can still happen\n\n1:07:07.100 --> 1:07:10.100\n in even just a scale of weeks versus months.\n\n1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:14.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:14.100 --> 1:07:16.320\n Well, let's talk about the vaccine.\n\n1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:18.940\n What are your thoughts on the safety and efficacy\n\n1:07:18.940 --> 1:07:22.900\n of COVID vaccines at the individual and the societal level?\n\n1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:26.220\n So for the vaccine safety data,\n\n1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:30.100\n it's actually challenging to convey to the public\n\n1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:31.460\n how this is normally done.\n\n1:07:31.460 --> 1:07:34.400\n Like normally you would do this in the context of the trial,\n\n1:07:34.400 --> 1:07:37.020\n you'd have a long trial with large numbers,\n\n1:07:37.020 --> 1:07:38.700\n relatively large numbers of people,\n\n1:07:38.700 --> 1:07:40.100\n you'd follow them over a long time\n\n1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:42.380\n and the trial will give you some indication\n\n1:07:42.380 --> 1:07:43.740\n of the safety of the vaccine.\n\n1:07:43.740 --> 1:07:47.620\n And it did, I mean, but the trial,\n\n1:07:47.620 --> 1:07:51.180\n the way it was constructed, when it came out\n\n1:07:51.180 --> 1:07:52.780\n that it was protective against COVID,\n\n1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:55.180\n it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm.\n\n1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:59.140\n And so that placebo arm was vaccinated, large part of it.\n\n1:08:00.140 --> 1:08:02.280\n And so that meant that from the trial,\n\n1:08:02.280 --> 1:08:05.180\n you were not going to be able to get data\n\n1:08:05.180 --> 1:08:07.680\n on the longterm safety profiles of the vaccine.\n\n1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:10.900\n And also the other thing about trials,\n\n1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:13.020\n although there's tens of thousands of people enrolled,\n\n1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:14.460\n that's still not enough to get\n\n1:08:14.460 --> 1:08:18.940\n when you deploy a vaccine at population scale,\n\n1:08:18.940 --> 1:08:21.220\n you're gonna see things that weren't in the trial,\n\n1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:23.820\n guaranteed, populations of people\n\n1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:25.740\n that weren't represented well in the trial\n\n1:08:25.740 --> 1:08:27.860\n are gonna be given the vaccine\n\n1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:29.980\n and then they're gonna have things that happen to them\n\n1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:32.260\n that you didn't anticipate.\n\n1:08:32.260 --> 1:08:35.580\n So I wasn't surprised when people were a little bit\n\n1:08:35.580 --> 1:08:38.580\n skeptical when the trial was done about the safety profile,\n\n1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:40.700\n just the way the nature of the thing was gonna make it\n\n1:08:40.700 --> 1:08:43.660\n so that it was gonna be hard to get a complete picture\n\n1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:45.120\n from the trials itself.\n\n1:08:45.120 --> 1:08:47.540\n And the trial showed they were pretty safe\n\n1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:51.300\n and quite effective at preventing both you\n\n1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:52.580\n from getting COVID,\n\n1:08:52.580 --> 1:08:54.900\n like I said, I think the main endpoint of the trial itself\n\n1:08:54.900 --> 1:08:57.840\n was a symptomatic COVID, right?\n\n1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:02.840\n So that was like, that was, I mean, it was really to me,\n\n1:09:03.660 --> 1:09:06.620\n like it was about as amazing achievement as anything,\n\n1:09:06.620 --> 1:09:10.740\n organizing a trial of that scale and running it so quickly.\n\n1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:14.420\n And the final results being so surprisingly high.\n\n1:09:14.420 --> 1:09:16.060\n So good, right?\n\n1:09:16.060 --> 1:09:20.060\n And so, but the problem then was,\n\n1:09:20.060 --> 1:09:23.020\n normally it would take a long time,\n\n1:09:23.020 --> 1:09:25.460\n the FDA would tell Pfizer to go back\n\n1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:27.140\n and try it in this subgroup,\n\n1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:28.660\n they'd work more on dosing,\n\n1:09:28.660 --> 1:09:31.060\n they do all these kinds of things\n\n1:09:31.060 --> 1:09:33.340\n that kind of didn't, we really didn't have time for\n\n1:09:33.340 --> 1:09:34.800\n in the middle of the pandemic, right?\n\n1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:39.800\n So you have a basis for approval that it's less full\n\n1:09:40.940 --> 1:09:44.120\n than normally you would have for a population scale vaccine.\n\n1:09:44.120 --> 1:09:47.520\n But the results were good, the results looked really good.\n\n1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:49.960\n And actually, I should say for the most part,\n\n1:09:49.960 --> 1:09:53.000\n that's been born out when we've given the vaccine at scale\n\n1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.760\n in terms of protection against severe disease, right?\n\n1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.340\n So people who have got the vaccine\n\n1:09:59.340 --> 1:10:01.240\n for a very long time after they've had\n\n1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:04.520\n for the full vaccination have had great protection\n\n1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:08.480\n against being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.\n\n1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:11.460\n Let's separate, because this seems to be,\n\n1:10:11.460 --> 1:10:16.060\n there's critics of both categories, but different.\n\n1:10:16.060 --> 1:10:20.940\n Kids and kids, not older people,\n\n1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:24.340\n like let's say five years old and above or something,\n\n1:10:24.340 --> 1:10:26.060\n or 13 years old and above.\n\n1:10:26.060 --> 1:10:31.060\n So for those, it seems like the reduction\n\n1:10:31.500 --> 1:10:35.940\n of the rate of fatalities and serious illness\n\n1:10:35.940 --> 1:10:38.280\n seems to be something like 10X.\n\n1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:42.300\n I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine.\n\n1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:47.020\n It transforms the problem of focus protection\n\n1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:49.220\n from something that's quite challenging,\n\n1:10:49.220 --> 1:10:50.820\n possible, I believe, but quite challenging\n\n1:10:50.820 --> 1:10:53.180\n to something that's much, much more manageable.\n\n1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:56.180\n Because the vaccine in and of itself when deployed\n\n1:10:56.180 --> 1:10:58.800\n in older populations is a form of focus protection.\n\n1:11:00.020 --> 1:11:03.340\n Yes, by the way, we'll talk about the focus protection\n\n1:11:03.340 --> 1:11:05.740\n in one segment, because it's such a brilliant idea\n\n1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:08.500\n for this pandemic or for future pandemics.\n\n1:11:08.500 --> 1:11:11.760\n I thought the sociological, psychological discussion\n\n1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:14.060\n about the letter from Francis Collins is,\n\n1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:17.380\n because it was so recent, it has been so troubling to me,\n\n1:11:17.380 --> 1:11:20.220\n so I'm glad we talked about that first.\n\n1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:24.940\n But so there seems to be, the vaccines work\n\n1:11:24.940 --> 1:11:29.340\n to reduce deaths, and that has especially\n\n1:11:29.340 --> 1:11:33.300\n the most transformative effects for the older folks.\n\n1:11:33.300 --> 1:11:35.100\n I've told you one thing that I got wrong in the pandemic.\n\n1:11:35.100 --> 1:11:36.500\n Let me tell you the second thing I got wrong,\n\n1:11:36.500 --> 1:11:38.220\n for sure, in the pandemic.\n\n1:11:38.220 --> 1:11:43.020\n In January of this year, 2021,\n\n1:11:43.020 --> 1:11:46.620\n I thought that the vaccines would stop infection.\n\n1:11:48.060 --> 1:11:48.900\n Yes.\n\n1:11:48.900 --> 1:11:51.620\n Right, it would make it so that you were much less likely\n\n1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:55.260\n to be infected at all, because the antibodies\n\n1:11:55.260 --> 1:11:56.460\n that were produced by the vaccines\n\n1:11:56.460 --> 1:11:58.220\n looked like they were neutralizing antibodies\n\n1:11:58.220 --> 1:12:01.220\n that would essentially block you from being infected at all.\n\n1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:06.220\n That turned out to be wrong, right?\n\n1:12:06.220 --> 1:12:10.660\n So I think, and it became clear as data came out\n\n1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:12.540\n from Israel, which vaccinated very early,\n\n1:12:12.540 --> 1:12:14.860\n that they were seeing surges of infection,\n\n1:12:14.860 --> 1:12:17.820\n even in a very highly vaccinated population,\n\n1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:21.780\n that the vaccine does not stop infection.\n\n1:12:21.780 --> 1:12:24.220\n So you're a used car salesman,\n\n1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:26.180\n and you were selling the vaccine,\n\n1:12:26.180 --> 1:12:28.460\n and the features you thought a vaccine would have,\n\n1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:30.100\n I mean, I have a similar kind of sense\n\n1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:31.660\n when the vaccine came out.\n\n1:12:31.660 --> 1:12:36.660\n Vaccine would reduce, if you somehow were able to get it,\n\n1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:40.300\n it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:12:40.300 --> 1:12:44.260\n but it would also reduce the chance of you getting it,\n\n1:12:44.260 --> 1:12:47.100\n and if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it\n\n1:12:47.100 --> 1:12:48.860\n to somebody else.\n\n1:12:48.860 --> 1:12:52.180\n And it turns out that those latter two things\n\n1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:55.820\n are not as definitive, or in fact,\n\n1:12:55.820 --> 1:12:57.860\n I mean, I don't know to which degree they're not there at all.\n\n1:12:57.860 --> 1:12:59.260\n I think it's a little complicated,\n\n1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:01.580\n because I think the first two or three months\n\n1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:04.340\n after you're fully vaccinated, after the second dose,\n\n1:13:04.340 --> 1:13:09.340\n you have 60, 70% efficacy peak against infection.\n\n1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:12.740\n So that, which is pretty good, I mean, right?\n\n1:13:12.740 --> 1:13:16.780\n But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%.\n\n1:13:16.780 --> 1:13:19.180\n Some places, some studies, like there's a study\n\n1:13:19.180 --> 1:13:21.540\n out of Sweden that suggests it might even drop to zero.\n\n1:13:21.540 --> 1:13:23.420\n But, and then you're also infectious\n\n1:13:23.420 --> 1:13:25.740\n for some period of time, if you do get it,\n\n1:13:25.740 --> 1:13:27.020\n even though you're vaccinated.\n\n1:13:27.020 --> 1:13:27.860\n Correct.\n\n1:13:27.860 --> 1:13:30.820\n It seems to be lucidated that the period of time\n\n1:13:30.820 --> 1:13:31.860\n your infectious is shorter.\n\n1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:36.500\n Is shorter, but the infectivity per day is about as high.\n\n1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:39.340\n So you still, the point is that the vaccine\n\n1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:41.820\n might reduce some risk of infecting others,\n\n1:13:41.820 --> 1:13:44.820\n but it's not a categorical difference.\n\n1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:49.660\n So, it's not safe to be in the presence\n\n1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:51.220\n of just vaccinated people.\n\n1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:52.660\n You can still get infected.\n\n1:13:53.860 --> 1:13:56.180\n Right, so, I mean, there's a million things\n\n1:13:56.180 --> 1:13:59.700\n I wanna ask here, but is there in some sense\n\n1:13:59.700 --> 1:14:04.020\n because the vaccine really helps\n\n1:14:04.020 --> 1:14:06.820\n on the worst part of this pandemic,\n\n1:14:06.820 --> 1:14:08.300\n which is killing people.\n\n1:14:08.300 --> 1:14:09.940\n Yes.\n\n1:14:09.940 --> 1:14:14.340\n Doesn't that mean, where does the vaccine hesitancy\n\n1:14:14.340 --> 1:14:17.640\n come from in terms of, it seems like,\n\n1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:20.560\n obviously a vaccine is a powerful solution\n\n1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:22.540\n to let us open this thing up.\n\n1:14:22.540 --> 1:14:24.540\n Yeah, so I wrote a Wall Street Journal op ed\n\n1:14:24.540 --> 1:14:26.980\n with Sunetra Gupta in December of last year.\n\n1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:27.820\n Yes.\n\n1:14:27.820 --> 1:14:29.780\n A very night with a very naive title,\n\n1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:32.380\n which says we can end the lockdowns in a month.\n\n1:14:32.380 --> 1:14:33.860\n And the idea is very simple.\n\n1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:37.780\n Vaccinate all vulnerable people\n\n1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:40.700\n and then open up.\n\n1:14:40.700 --> 1:14:41.540\n Open up.\n\n1:14:41.540 --> 1:14:44.660\n Right, and the idea was that the lockdown harms,\n\n1:14:44.660 --> 1:14:47.100\n this is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration.\n\n1:14:47.100 --> 1:14:49.500\n Great Barrington Declaration said the lockdown harms\n\n1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:53.240\n are devastating to the population at large.\n\n1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.980\n There's this considerable segment of people\n\n1:14:55.980 --> 1:14:58.340\n that are vulnerable, protect them.\n\n1:14:58.340 --> 1:15:00.300\n Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool\n\n1:15:00.300 --> 1:15:02.740\n to protect the vulnerable, which is, I still believe,\n\n1:15:02.740 --> 1:15:04.300\n I mean, it's true, right?\n\n1:15:04.300 --> 1:15:07.180\n You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population,\n\n1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.380\n and as you said, there's a tenfold decrease\n\n1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:13.180\n in the mortality risk from getting infected,\n\n1:15:13.180 --> 1:15:14.980\n which is, I mean, amazing.\n\n1:15:14.980 --> 1:15:17.240\n So that was the strategy we outlined.\n\n1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:20.480\n What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed.\n\n1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:22.860\n So first there's, so you're asking about vaccine hesitancy.\n\n1:15:22.860 --> 1:15:27.020\n I think first there's the inherent limitations\n\n1:15:27.020 --> 1:15:29.460\n of how to measure vaccine safety, right?\n\n1:15:29.460 --> 1:15:31.620\n So we talked about a little bit about the trial,\n\n1:15:31.620 --> 1:15:35.140\n but also after the trial, there's a mechanism,\n\n1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:37.940\n and this is the work I've been involved with before COVID,\n\n1:15:37.940 --> 1:15:42.460\n on tracking and identifying and checking\n\n1:15:42.460 --> 1:15:43.980\n whether the vaccines actually are safe.\n\n1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:46.400\n And the central challenge is one of causality.\n\n1:15:47.260 --> 1:15:49.460\n So you no longer have the randomized trial,\n\n1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:52.780\n but you wanna know is the vaccine,\n\n1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:56.860\n when it's deployed at scale, causing adverse events.\n\n1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:00.100\n Well, you can't just look at people who are vaccinated\n\n1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:02.100\n and see what adverse events happen,\n\n1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:03.980\n because you don't know what would have happened\n\n1:16:03.980 --> 1:16:06.080\n if the person had not been vaccinated.\n\n1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:09.820\n So you have to have some control group.\n\n1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:12.080\n Now, what happened is there's several systems\n\n1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:14.700\n to check this that the CDC uses.\n\n1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:18.220\n One very commonly known one now is called VAERS,\n\n1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:20.580\n the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.\n\n1:16:20.580 --> 1:16:23.420\n There, anyone who has an adverse event,\n\n1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:26.820\n either a regular person or a doctor can just go report,\n\n1:16:26.820 --> 1:16:28.940\n look, I had the vaccine and two days later I had a headache\n\n1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:32.060\n or whatever it is, the person died\n\n1:16:32.060 --> 1:16:34.280\n a day after I had the vaccine, right?\n\n1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:37.660\n Now, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first,\n\n1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:42.180\n and older people die sometimes with or without the vaccine.\n\n1:16:42.180 --> 1:16:44.740\n So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated\n\n1:16:44.740 --> 1:16:46.700\n and a few days later they die.\n\n1:16:46.700 --> 1:16:48.540\n Did the vaccine cause it or something else cause it?\n\n1:16:48.540 --> 1:16:50.320\n Really difficult to tell.\n\n1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.460\n In order to tell, you need a control group.\n\n1:16:53.540 --> 1:16:58.540\n For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have,\n\n1:16:58.580 --> 1:17:02.360\n like there's one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Datalink.\n\n1:17:02.360 --> 1:17:04.020\n There's another system called BEST,\n\n1:17:05.060 --> 1:17:06.880\n I forget what the acronym is,\n\n1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:11.480\n to essentially to track cohorts of people,\n\n1:17:11.480 --> 1:17:13.940\n vaccinated versus unvaccinated,\n\n1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:15.700\n with as careful of matching as you can do.\n\n1:17:15.700 --> 1:17:17.020\n It's not randomized,\n\n1:17:17.020 --> 1:17:21.380\n and then see if you have safety signals\n\n1:17:21.380 --> 1:17:23.700\n that pop up in the vaccinated\n\n1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:25.900\n relative to the control group unvaccinated.\n\n1:17:27.100 --> 1:17:28.140\n And so that's, for instance,\n\n1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:32.000\n how the myocarditis risk was picked up\n\n1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.260\n in especially young men.\n\n1:17:34.260 --> 1:17:38.020\n It's also how the higher risk of blood clots\n\n1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:41.060\n in middle age and older women\n\n1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:42.860\n with the J&J vaccine was picked up.\n\n1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:46.400\n There, what you have are situations\n\n1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:50.460\n where the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low\n\n1:17:50.460 --> 1:17:54.100\n that if you see them in the vaccinated arm at all,\n\n1:17:54.100 --> 1:17:57.420\n that it's not hard to understand that the vaccine did this.\n\n1:17:57.420 --> 1:18:00.540\n Young men should not be having myocarditis.\n\n1:18:00.540 --> 1:18:02.300\n Middle age women should not be having\n\n1:18:02.300 --> 1:18:04.400\n huge blood clots in the brain.\n\n1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:05.900\n So when you see that, you can say it's linked.\n\n1:18:05.900 --> 1:18:07.380\n Now, the rates are low.\n\n1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:09.540\n So young men, maybe one in 5,000,\n\n1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:11.940\n one in 10,000 of the vaccine,\n\n1:18:11.940 --> 1:18:14.180\n vaccine related myocarditis, pericarditis.\n\n1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:17.660\n Young women, middle age women, I don't know.\n\n1:18:17.660 --> 1:18:19.700\n I'm not sure what the right number might be,\n\n1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:23.700\n but like I'd say, it's like one in hundreds of thousands,\n\n1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:24.660\n something like that.\n\n1:18:26.420 --> 1:18:27.900\n So these are rare outcomes,\n\n1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:30.940\n but they are vaccine linked outcomes.\n\n1:18:30.940 --> 1:18:33.780\n How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?\n\n1:18:33.780 --> 1:18:35.380\n I think you just tell people.\n\n1:18:35.380 --> 1:18:36.860\n You tell people here are the risks.\n\n1:18:36.860 --> 1:18:37.860\n You transparently tell them.\n\n1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:38.700\n And just, you're not,\n\n1:18:38.700 --> 1:18:41.200\n so they're not getting into something that they don't know.\n\n1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:45.460\n And don't treat people like they're children\n\n1:18:45.460 --> 1:18:47.300\n and need to be told lies\n\n1:18:47.300 --> 1:18:48.700\n because they won't understand\n\n1:18:48.700 --> 1:18:50.980\n the full complexity of the truth.\n\n1:18:50.980 --> 1:18:54.220\n People, I think, are pretty good at,\n\n1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:59.220\n or actually, people with time are good at understanding data,\n\n1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:01.460\n but better than anything.\n\n1:19:01.460 --> 1:19:04.460\n They're better at,\n\n1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:08.440\n they're extremely good at detecting arrogance and bullshit.\n\n1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:10.780\n And you give them either one of those.\n\n1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:11.700\n I mean, I'll give you one\n\n1:19:11.700 --> 1:19:14.740\n that's where I think it's greatly undermined vaccine,\n\n1:19:14.740 --> 1:19:16.620\n greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine,\n\n1:19:16.620 --> 1:19:20.460\n is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID,\n\n1:19:20.460 --> 1:19:24.100\n you have extremely good immunity,\n\n1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:27.100\n both against infection and access to disease.\n\n1:19:27.100 --> 1:19:31.820\n And that denial leads to people distrusting the message\n\n1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:33.860\n given by like the CDC director, for instance,\n\n1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:35.940\n in favor of the vaccine, right?\n\n1:19:35.940 --> 1:19:39.580\n Why would you deny a thing that's such an obvious fact?\n\n1:19:39.580 --> 1:19:42.060\n Like you can look at the data and it just,\n\n1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.700\n I mean, it just pops out at you\n\n1:19:43.700 --> 1:19:45.860\n that people that are COVID recovered\n\n1:19:45.860 --> 1:19:48.760\n are not getting infected again at very high rates,\n\n1:19:48.760 --> 1:19:50.340\n much lower rates.\n\n1:19:50.340 --> 1:19:52.200\n After these kinds of conversations,\n\n1:19:53.020 --> 1:19:55.560\n I'm sure after this very conversation,\n\n1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:59.420\n I often get a number of messages from Joe, Joe Rogan,\n\n1:19:59.420 --> 1:20:03.600\n and from Sam Harris, who to me are people I admire,\n\n1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:06.560\n I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings.\n\n1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:08.420\n They also have a platform.\n\n1:20:08.420 --> 1:20:11.140\n And I believe, at least in my mind,\n\n1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:14.120\n about this COVID set of topics,\n\n1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:17.240\n they represent a group of people.\n\n1:20:19.860 --> 1:20:24.400\n Each group has smart, thoughtful,\n\n1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:27.900\n well intentioned human beings.\n\n1:20:27.900 --> 1:20:30.320\n And I don't know who is right,\n\n1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:35.320\n but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit,\n\n1:20:36.300 --> 1:20:37.200\n those groups.\n\n1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:41.060\n And so the question I wanna ask is like,\n\n1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:45.020\n what do you think about these two groups\n\n1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:48.860\n and this kind of tension over the vaccine\n\n1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:54.020\n that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics\n\n1:20:54.020 --> 1:20:55.380\n on which to focus on,\n\n1:20:55.380 --> 1:20:57.820\n like whether kids should get vaccinated or not,\n\n1:20:57.820 --> 1:21:00.380\n whether there should be vaccine mandates or not,\n\n1:21:00.380 --> 1:21:03.420\n which seem to be often very kind of specific policy\n\n1:21:03.420 --> 1:21:06.180\n kinds of questions that miss the bigger picture.\n\n1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:08.300\n I think it's a symptom of the distrust\n\n1:21:08.300 --> 1:21:10.460\n that people have in public health.\n\n1:21:10.460 --> 1:21:13.900\n I think this kind of schism over the vaccine\n\n1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:15.300\n does not happen in places\n\n1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:16.580\n where the public health authorities\n\n1:21:16.580 --> 1:21:18.860\n have been much more trustworthy, right?\n\n1:21:18.860 --> 1:21:20.060\n So you don't see this vaccine\n\n1:21:20.060 --> 1:21:21.900\n hasn't seen Sweden, for instance.\n\n1:21:23.620 --> 1:21:25.620\n What's happened in the United States\n\n1:21:25.620 --> 1:21:30.540\n is that the vaccine has become first because of politics,\n\n1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:33.020\n but then also because of the scientific arrogance,\n\n1:21:33.020 --> 1:21:35.100\n this sort of touchstone issue,\n\n1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:37.180\n and people line up on both sides of it,\n\n1:21:37.180 --> 1:21:39.540\n and the different language you're hearing\n\n1:21:39.540 --> 1:21:40.820\n is structured around that.\n\n1:21:40.820 --> 1:21:42.580\n So before the election, for instance,\n\n1:21:42.580 --> 1:21:46.580\n I did a testimony in the House\n\n1:21:46.580 --> 1:21:49.760\n on measurement of vaccine safety.\n\n1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:52.540\n And I was invited by the Republicans.\n\n1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:54.420\n There were, I think, four other experts\n\n1:21:54.420 --> 1:21:55.260\n invited by the Democrats,\n\n1:21:55.260 --> 1:21:57.620\n or three other experts invited by Democrats,\n\n1:21:57.620 --> 1:21:59.220\n each of whom had a lot of experience\n\n1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.600\n in measuring vaccine safety.\n\n1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:04.720\n I was really surprised to hear them each doubt\n\n1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.860\n whether the FDA would do a reasonable job\n\n1:22:06.860 --> 1:22:08.760\n in assessing vaccine safety,\n\n1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:11.140\n including by people who have long records\n\n1:22:11.140 --> 1:22:12.940\n of working with the FDA.\n\n1:22:12.940 --> 1:22:17.100\n I mean, these are professionals, great scientists,\n\n1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:19.420\n whose main sort of goal in life\n\n1:22:19.420 --> 1:22:22.460\n is to make sure that unsafe vaccines\n\n1:22:22.460 --> 1:22:24.100\n don't get released into the world.\n\n1:22:24.100 --> 1:22:26.420\n And if they are, they get pulled.\n\n1:22:26.420 --> 1:22:28.500\n And they're casting down on the vaccine\n\n1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:32.100\n the ability to track vaccine safety before the election.\n\n1:22:32.100 --> 1:22:34.860\n And then after the election,\n\n1:22:34.860 --> 1:22:38.380\n the rhetoric switched on a dime, right?\n\n1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:40.580\n All of a sudden, it's Republicans that are cast\n\n1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:42.780\n as if they're vaccine hesitant.\n\n1:22:42.780 --> 1:22:46.860\n That kind of political shift, the public notices.\n\n1:22:46.860 --> 1:22:49.340\n If all it takes is an election to change\n\n1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:51.460\n how people talk about the safety of the vaccine,\n\n1:22:51.460 --> 1:22:53.260\n well, we're not talking science anymore,\n\n1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:54.820\n many people think, right?\n\n1:22:54.820 --> 1:22:57.140\n I think that created its hesitancy.\n\n1:22:58.380 --> 1:22:59.740\n The other thing I think,\n\n1:22:59.740 --> 1:23:04.140\n I think the hesitancy,\n\n1:23:04.140 --> 1:23:07.960\n some politicians viewed it as a political,\n\n1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:10.740\n as sort of like a political opportunity\n\n1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:13.200\n to sort of demonize people who are hesitant.\n\n1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:16.820\n And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?\n\n1:23:16.820 --> 1:23:18.620\n Like if you're telling me I'm a rube\n\n1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:19.920\n that just doesn't want the vaccine\n\n1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:20.880\n because I want everyone to die,\n\n1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:23.540\n well, I'm gonna react really negatively.\n\n1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:27.580\n And if you're talking down to me\n\n1:23:27.580 --> 1:23:32.580\n about my legitimate sort of concerns\n\n1:23:32.860 --> 1:23:34.300\n about whether this vaccine is safe to take,\n\n1:23:34.300 --> 1:23:36.540\n I mean, I've heard from women\n\n1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:37.740\n who were thinking about getting pregnant,\n\n1:23:37.740 --> 1:23:38.780\n should I take the vaccine?\n\n1:23:38.780 --> 1:23:39.620\n I don't know.\n\n1:23:39.620 --> 1:23:41.240\n I mean, there are all kinds of questions,\n\n1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:44.240\n legitimate questions that I think\n\n1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:45.900\n should have good data to answer\n\n1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:47.940\n that we don't necessarily have good data to answer.\n\n1:23:47.940 --> 1:23:50.160\n So what do you do in the face of that?\n\n1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:52.980\n Well, one reaction is to pretend\n\n1:23:52.980 --> 1:23:55.460\n like we know for a fact that it's safe\n\n1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:57.700\n when we don't have the data to know for a fact\n\n1:23:57.700 --> 1:23:58.540\n in that particular group\n\n1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:01.880\n with that particular set of clinical circumstances you know.\n\n1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:03.780\n And that I think breeds hesitancy.\n\n1:24:03.780 --> 1:24:05.560\n People can detect that bullshit.\n\n1:24:06.460 --> 1:24:09.320\n Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know.\n\n1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:10.680\n Yeah, leave with humility.\n\n1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:13.360\n Yeah, you will end up with a better result.\n\n1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:15.940\n Let me ask you about,\n\n1:24:15.940 --> 1:24:19.180\n I've recently had a conversation with the Pfizer CEO.\n\n1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:24.180\n This is part therapy session, part advice,\n\n1:24:24.180 --> 1:24:29.180\n because again, I really want us to get through this together\n\n1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:31.640\n and it feels like the division is a thing\n\n1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:35.260\n that prevents us from getting through this together.\n\n1:24:35.260 --> 1:24:38.620\n And once again, just like with Francis Collins,\n\n1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:43.620\n a lot of people wrote to me words of support\n\n1:24:43.660 --> 1:24:47.200\n and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism.\n\n1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:53.140\n I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism.\n\n1:24:53.140 --> 1:24:57.540\n So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine\n\n1:24:57.540 --> 1:24:58.940\n and those kinds of things.\n\n1:24:58.940 --> 1:25:01.000\n That I have a better understanding of.\n\n1:25:02.080 --> 1:25:06.540\n But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer.\n\n1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:12.440\n So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly,\n\n1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:18.620\n I'm trying to understand am I so naive\n\n1:25:19.620 --> 1:25:21.540\n that I just don't see it?\n\n1:25:21.540 --> 1:25:26.380\n Because yes, there's corrupt people and they're greedy,\n\n1:25:26.380 --> 1:25:28.900\n they're flawed in all walks of life.\n\n1:25:29.820 --> 1:25:34.820\n But companies do quite an incredible job\n\n1:25:35.740 --> 1:25:37.780\n of taking a good idea at the scale\n\n1:25:37.780 --> 1:25:39.580\n and making some money with that idea.\n\n1:25:39.580 --> 1:25:43.420\n But they are the ones that achieve scale on a good idea.\n\n1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:46.340\n I don't know, it's not obvious to me.\n\n1:25:46.340 --> 1:25:49.780\n I don't see where the manipulation is.\n\n1:25:49.780 --> 1:25:53.820\n So the fear that people have and I talked to Joe\n\n1:25:53.820 --> 1:25:55.020\n about this quite a bit.\n\n1:25:55.020 --> 1:25:57.500\n I think this is a legitimate fear\n\n1:25:57.500 --> 1:26:00.300\n and a fear you should often have\n\n1:26:00.300 --> 1:26:01.780\n that money has influenced,\n\n1:26:01.780 --> 1:26:04.940\n this proportional influence, especially in politics.\n\n1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:09.940\n So the fear is that the policy of the vaccine\n\n1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:13.500\n was connected to the fact that lots of money\n\n1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:16.540\n could be made by manufacturing the vaccine.\n\n1:26:17.540 --> 1:26:19.340\n And I understand that.\n\n1:26:19.340 --> 1:26:22.040\n And it's actually quite a heck of a difficult task\n\n1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:24.580\n to alleviate that concern.\n\n1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:27.900\n Like you really have to be a great man or woman or a leader\n\n1:26:27.900 --> 1:26:30.460\n to convince people that you're not full of shit,\n\n1:26:30.460 --> 1:26:32.700\n that you're not just playing a game on them.\n\n1:26:32.700 --> 1:26:35.280\n I don't know, it's a difficult task.\n\n1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:38.080\n But at the same time, I really don't like\n\n1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:41.820\n the natural distrust every billionaire,\n\n1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:44.180\n distrust everybody who's trying to make money\n\n1:26:44.180 --> 1:26:47.860\n because it feels like under a capitalistic system at least,\n\n1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:50.380\n the way to do a lot of good,\n\n1:26:50.380 --> 1:26:53.260\n like to do good at scale in the world\n\n1:26:53.260 --> 1:26:57.940\n is by being at least in part motivated by profit.\n\n1:26:57.940 --> 1:26:59.360\n I mean, I share your ambivalence, right?\n\n1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:02.860\n So on the one hand, you have a fantastic achievement.\n\n1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:06.720\n The discovery of the vaccine\n\n1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:08.860\n and then the manufacturing at scale\n\n1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:12.660\n so that billions of people can take the vaccine\n\n1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:14.080\n in a relatively short time.\n\n1:27:14.080 --> 1:27:15.700\n That is a remarkable achievement\n\n1:27:15.700 --> 1:27:18.960\n that could not have happened without companies like Pfizer.\n\n1:27:20.340 --> 1:27:21.540\n And on the other hand,\n\n1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:24.760\n there is this sort of corrupting influence of that money.\n\n1:27:25.820 --> 1:27:27.380\n Just to give you one example,\n\n1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:30.260\n there's an enormous controversy over whether\n\n1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:32.820\n relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs\n\n1:27:32.820 --> 1:27:35.720\n can be used to treat the disease.\n\n1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.400\n None of, no company like Pfizer\n\n1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:43.020\n has any interest whatsoever in evaluating it.\n\n1:27:43.020 --> 1:27:45.500\n Even Merck, I think it was Merck,\n\n1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:50.420\n that had the patent on ivermectin now expired,\n\n1:27:50.420 --> 1:27:54.460\n has no interest at all in checking to see if it works.\n\n1:27:54.460 --> 1:27:56.680\n Not only do they not have interest,\n\n1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:01.580\n they have a way of talking about people\n\n1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:04.540\n who might have a little bit of interest\n\n1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:06.180\n that's again.\n\n1:28:06.180 --> 1:28:07.020\n Fringe.\n\n1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:09.540\n Full of arrogance.\n\n1:28:09.540 --> 1:28:10.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:10.380 --> 1:28:12.920\n And that is what troubles me.\n\n1:28:12.920 --> 1:28:15.660\n Is there not a, it's back to the play of science.\n\n1:28:15.660 --> 1:28:17.700\n It's not, they're not a bit of curiosity.\n\n1:28:17.700 --> 1:28:20.780\n One, okay, one, the natural curiosity of a human being\n\n1:28:20.780 --> 1:28:23.340\n that should always be there and an open mind is.\n\n1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:25.700\n And second, in the case of ivermectin\n\n1:28:25.700 --> 1:28:27.220\n and other things like that,\n\n1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:28.940\n you have to acknowledge\n\n1:28:28.940 --> 1:28:31.500\n that there's a very large number of people\n\n1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:33.580\n who care about this topic.\n\n1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:36.540\n And this is a way to inspire them\n\n1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:38.860\n to also play in the space of science,\n\n1:28:38.860 --> 1:28:39.860\n to inspire them with science.\n\n1:28:39.860 --> 1:28:42.840\n You can't just like dismiss everybody\n\n1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:45.860\n that you can't just dismiss people, period.\n\n1:28:45.860 --> 1:28:46.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:46.700 --> 1:28:48.340\n Well, I mean, I think here, take ivermectin, right?\n\n1:28:48.340 --> 1:28:51.700\n There's actually a study funded by the NIH,\n\n1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:56.020\n by Tony Fauci's NIAID and the NIH\n\n1:28:56.020 --> 1:29:01.020\n called ACTIV6 that's a randomized trial of ivermectin.\n\n1:29:02.780 --> 1:29:05.500\n It's due to be completed in March, 2023.\n\n1:29:07.260 --> 1:29:10.940\n So normally when you have private actors\n\n1:29:10.940 --> 1:29:13.740\n like these big drug companies that have no interest\n\n1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:16.660\n in conducting some kind of scientific experiment\n\n1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:18.740\n that would have some public benefit,\n\n1:29:18.740 --> 1:29:20.940\n it's the job of the government,\n\n1:29:20.940 --> 1:29:23.540\n and in this case, the NIH to fund that kind of work.\n\n1:29:24.500 --> 1:29:27.700\n The NIH has been incredibly slow\n\n1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:32.940\n in its evaluations of these repurposed drugs.\n\n1:29:32.940 --> 1:29:37.820\n And it's been left to lots of other private activities\n\n1:29:37.820 --> 1:29:39.620\n of uneven quality.\n\n1:29:39.620 --> 1:29:42.220\n And hence, that's why you have these big fights.\n\n1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:44.220\n Because the data are not solid,\n\n1:29:44.220 --> 1:29:45.940\n you're gonna have these big fights.\n\n1:29:45.940 --> 1:29:50.100\n Yeah, but also, okay, forget the process of science here,\n\n1:29:50.100 --> 1:29:53.580\n the studies, not enough effort being put into the studies,\n\n1:29:53.580 --> 1:29:55.180\n just the way it's being communicated about.\n\n1:29:55.180 --> 1:29:57.520\n Yeah, no, like to horse paste, I mean, come on.\n\n1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:01.780\n The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like,\n\n1:30:01.780 --> 1:30:02.740\n they're taking ivermectin\n\n1:30:02.740 --> 1:30:04.140\n because they've heard good things about it\n\n1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:06.180\n and they're sick and they're desperate.\n\n1:30:06.180 --> 1:30:09.740\n And to call it horse paste, that was terrible.\n\n1:30:09.740 --> 1:30:10.960\n That was deeply irresponsible.\n\n1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:13.740\n My hope is grounded in the fact\n\n1:30:13.740 --> 1:30:16.540\n that young people see the bullshit of this,\n\n1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:18.700\n young PhD students, graduate students,\n\n1:30:18.700 --> 1:30:20.200\n young students in college,\n\n1:30:20.200 --> 1:30:25.200\n they see the less than stellar way\n\n1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:27.660\n that our scientific leaders\n\n1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:29.380\n and our political leaders are behaving,\n\n1:30:29.380 --> 1:30:30.580\n and then the new generation\n\n1:30:30.580 --> 1:30:33.180\n will not repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\n1:30:33.180 --> 1:30:36.680\n That is my hope, because that's the cool thing I see\n\n1:30:36.680 --> 1:30:40.260\n about young people is they're good at detecting bullshit\n\n1:30:40.260 --> 1:30:42.400\n and they don't want to be part of that.\n\n1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:46.780\n That's my hope in the space of science.\n\n1:30:46.780 --> 1:30:48.460\n Let me return to this idea\n\n1:30:48.460 --> 1:30:50.540\n of the Great Barrington Declaration,\n\n1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:52.660\n return to the beginning.\n\n1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:54.760\n So what are the basics?\n\n1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:57.280\n Can you describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is?\n\n1:30:57.280 --> 1:30:58.660\n What are some of the ideas in it?\n\n1:30:58.660 --> 1:31:01.520\n You mentioned focused protection.\n\n1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:04.460\n What are your concerns about lockdowns?\n\n1:31:04.460 --> 1:31:07.380\n Just paint the picture of this early proposal.\n\n1:31:07.380 --> 1:31:09.260\n Sure, so the Great Barrington Declaration,\n\n1:31:09.260 --> 1:31:11.860\n first, why is it called Great Barrington Declaration?\n\n1:31:11.860 --> 1:31:13.300\n It's such a great name.\n\n1:31:14.580 --> 1:31:16.820\n I mean, it's such an epic name,\n\n1:31:16.820 --> 1:31:20.380\n but the reason why it's called that is way less than epic.\n\n1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:23.900\n It was because the conference,\n\n1:31:23.900 --> 1:31:25.540\n which is organized by Martin Kulldorff,\n\n1:31:25.540 --> 1:31:27.780\n who was a professor at Harvard University,\n\n1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:32.780\n by a statistician, he actually designed the safety system,\n\n1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:36.340\n the statistical system that the FDA uses\n\n1:31:36.340 --> 1:31:38.940\n for tracking vaccine safety.\n\n1:31:38.940 --> 1:31:43.100\n He and I had met previously just the summer before,\n\n1:31:43.100 --> 1:31:45.940\n that summer, and he invited me\n\n1:31:45.940 --> 1:31:47.740\n to come to this small conference\n\n1:31:47.740 --> 1:31:50.220\n where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta,\n\n1:31:50.220 --> 1:31:53.380\n who is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Harvard,\n\n1:31:53.380 --> 1:31:54.900\n sorry, at Oxford University.\n\n1:31:54.900 --> 1:31:57.980\n And I mean, I jumped at the chance\n\n1:31:57.980 --> 1:32:00.980\n because I knew that Martin and Sunetra\n\n1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:02.160\n were both smarter than me,\n\n1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:04.380\n and it would be fun to talk about\n\n1:32:04.380 --> 1:32:07.260\n what the right strategy would be.\n\n1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:10.740\n On the drive in, I didn't know what the name of the town was\n\n1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:13.540\n and I asked, they said it was Great Barrington,\n\n1:32:13.540 --> 1:32:16.020\n and I had it in the back of my head.\n\n1:32:16.020 --> 1:32:17.620\n Martin and I arrived a little early\n\n1:32:17.620 --> 1:32:20.180\n and we were writing an op ed about some of the ideas,\n\n1:32:20.180 --> 1:32:22.340\n I hope we'll get to talk about very soon,\n\n1:32:22.340 --> 1:32:25.420\n about focused protection and the right strategy.\n\n1:32:25.420 --> 1:32:27.260\n And when Sunetra arrived,\n\n1:32:27.260 --> 1:32:30.140\n we realized we'd actually come basically to the same place\n\n1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:32.980\n about the right way to deal with the epidemic.\n\n1:32:34.340 --> 1:32:37.940\n And I thought, well, why don't we write something\n\n1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:39.260\n like the Port Huron Statement,\n\n1:32:39.260 --> 1:32:41.460\n is what I had in the back of my head.\n\n1:32:41.460 --> 1:32:43.580\n And I'm like, well, what's the name of this town again?\n\n1:32:43.580 --> 1:32:44.700\n It was Great Barrington.\n\n1:32:44.700 --> 1:32:47.940\n Yeah, so it's not Barrington, it's Great Barrington.\n\n1:32:47.940 --> 1:32:50.060\n Which is fantastic, right?\n\n1:32:50.060 --> 1:32:53.060\n It's so over the top that it's perfect.\n\n1:32:53.060 --> 1:32:55.740\n It's literally like the Big Bang.\n\n1:32:55.740 --> 1:32:58.300\n There's something about these over the top fun titles\n\n1:32:58.300 --> 1:33:01.140\n that just really delivered the power.\n\n1:33:01.140 --> 1:33:03.740\n That's my main contribution was the title,\n\n1:33:03.740 --> 1:33:05.820\n the name Great Barrington Decorate.\n\n1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.340\n But yeah, so it was kind of a,\n\n1:33:07.340 --> 1:33:12.060\n so the idea is actually, well, the title is great.\n\n1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.820\n And I think that it was written in a very stylish way.\n\n1:33:14.820 --> 1:33:18.740\n It's less than a page, you can go look online and read it.\n\n1:33:18.740 --> 1:33:21.820\n It's written for, not for scientists,\n\n1:33:21.820 --> 1:33:23.180\n but for the general public\n\n1:33:23.180 --> 1:33:25.780\n so that people can understand the ideas really simply.\n\n1:33:26.900 --> 1:33:29.500\n But it is not actually a radical set of ideas.\n\n1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:32.820\n It actually represents the old pandemic plans\n\n1:33:32.820 --> 1:33:35.180\n that we've used for a century\n\n1:33:35.180 --> 1:33:37.260\n dealing with other similar pandemics.\n\n1:33:38.740 --> 1:33:40.460\n And it's twofold.\n\n1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:43.420\n First, let me talk about the science it rests on,\n\n1:33:43.420 --> 1:33:45.100\n and then I'll talk about the plan.\n\n1:33:45.100 --> 1:33:47.700\n The science actually, some of it we already talked about.\n\n1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:49.620\n There's this massive age gradient\n\n1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:51.980\n in the risk of COVID infection.\n\n1:33:51.980 --> 1:33:54.620\n Older people face much higher risk than younger people.\n\n1:33:55.740 --> 1:33:57.380\n The second bit of science is all,\n\n1:33:57.380 --> 1:33:58.780\n that's not controversial, right?\n\n1:33:58.780 --> 1:34:01.980\n Even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2,\n\n1:34:01.980 --> 1:34:03.460\n no matter what, everyone thinks,\n\n1:34:03.460 --> 1:34:05.460\n everyone agrees on this age gradient.\n\n1:34:06.700 --> 1:34:09.860\n The second bit of science is also not controversial.\n\n1:34:09.860 --> 1:34:13.380\n The lockdown focused policies that we've followed\n\n1:34:13.380 --> 1:34:16.340\n have absolutely devastating consequences\n\n1:34:16.340 --> 1:34:18.580\n on the health of the population.\n\n1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:21.940\n Let me just give you some examples.\n\n1:34:21.940 --> 1:34:24.660\n And this was known in October of 2020 when we wrote it.\n\n1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:28.060\n So the UN was sounding alarms\n\n1:34:28.060 --> 1:34:31.780\n that there would be tens of millions of people\n\n1:34:31.780 --> 1:34:34.100\n who would starve as a consequence\n\n1:34:34.100 --> 1:34:37.420\n of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns.\n\n1:34:37.420 --> 1:34:38.700\n And that's come to pass.\n\n1:34:38.700 --> 1:34:40.780\n Hundreds of thousands of children\n\n1:34:40.780 --> 1:34:43.380\n in places like South Asia dead from starvation\n\n1:34:43.380 --> 1:34:45.300\n as a consequence of lockdowns.\n\n1:34:47.740 --> 1:34:52.740\n The priorities like the treatment of patients\n\n1:34:53.620 --> 1:34:57.580\n with tuberculosis in poor countries stopped\n\n1:34:57.580 --> 1:34:59.180\n because of lockdowns.\n\n1:35:00.540 --> 1:35:04.340\n Childhood vaccinations of measles, mumps, rubella,\n\n1:35:04.340 --> 1:35:07.940\n DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus,\n\n1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:11.940\n all those standard vaccination campaigns stopped.\n\n1:35:11.940 --> 1:35:15.940\n Tens of millions of children skipping these doses\n\n1:35:15.940 --> 1:35:18.860\n for diseases that are actually deadly for them.\n\n1:35:19.820 --> 1:35:22.820\n Is there, just on a small tangent,\n\n1:35:22.820 --> 1:35:26.100\n is it well understood to you what are the mechanisms\n\n1:35:26.100 --> 1:35:28.540\n that stop all those things because of lockdowns?\n\n1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:30.460\n Is it some aspect of supply chain?\n\n1:35:30.460 --> 1:35:34.420\n Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed?\n\n1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:37.900\n Is it because there's a disincentive to go outside\n\n1:35:37.900 --> 1:35:40.380\n by people even when they deeply need help?\n\n1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:42.180\n It's all of the above.\n\n1:35:42.180 --> 1:35:43.860\n But a lot of those efforts,\n\n1:35:43.860 --> 1:35:46.340\n especially those vaccination efforts are funded\n\n1:35:46.340 --> 1:35:49.540\n and run by Western efforts.\n\n1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:53.020\n Like Gavi is a, I think it's a Gates funded thing actually\n\n1:35:53.020 --> 1:35:57.820\n that provides vaccines for millions of kids worldwide.\n\n1:35:57.820 --> 1:36:00.860\n And those efforts were scaled back.\n\n1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:02.500\n Malaria prevention efforts.\n\n1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:04.380\n So in the developing world,\n\n1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:07.820\n it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns.\n\n1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:08.900\n There was also direct effects.\n\n1:36:08.900 --> 1:36:13.060\n Like in India, the lockdowns, when they first instituted,\n\n1:36:13.060 --> 1:36:16.940\n there was an order that 10 million migrant workers\n\n1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:19.660\n who live in big cities and they live hand to mouth,\n\n1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:23.420\n they buy coconuts, they sell the coconuts with the money,\n\n1:36:23.420 --> 1:36:25.100\n they buy food for themselves and coconuts\n\n1:36:25.100 --> 1:36:26.540\n for the next day to sell,\n\n1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:29.180\n walk back to their villages\n\n1:36:29.180 --> 1:36:33.180\n or go back to their villages overnight.\n\n1:36:33.180 --> 1:36:35.500\n So 10 million people walking back to their villages\n\n1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:39.100\n or taking a train back, 1,000 died on route.\n\n1:36:39.100 --> 1:36:42.180\n Overcrowded trains dying essentially on the side of the road.\n\n1:36:42.180 --> 1:36:44.700\n I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.\n\n1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:48.820\n And the lockdowns there,\n\n1:36:50.500 --> 1:36:53.140\n it's kind of like what's happened in the West as well,\n\n1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:55.340\n but it was so severe.\n\n1:36:55.340 --> 1:36:58.540\n There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai\n\n1:36:58.540 --> 1:37:00.180\n by a friend of mine at the University of Chicago.\n\n1:37:00.180 --> 1:37:03.500\n What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai,\n\n1:37:03.500 --> 1:37:08.500\n there were 70% seroprevalence in July or August of 2020,\n\n1:37:08.700 --> 1:37:12.300\n whereas in the rest of Mumbai, it was 20%, right?\n\n1:37:12.300 --> 1:37:14.180\n So it was incredibly unequal.\n\n1:37:14.180 --> 1:37:17.660\n The lockdowns protected the relatively well off\n\n1:37:17.660 --> 1:37:20.700\n and spread the disease among the poor.\n\n1:37:22.260 --> 1:37:25.500\n So that's in the developing world.\n\n1:37:25.500 --> 1:37:27.900\n In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns\n\n1:37:27.900 --> 1:37:31.060\n were also quite bad, right?\n\n1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:34.140\n So we've talked already about isolation and depression.\n\n1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:37.660\n There was a study done in July of 2020\n\n1:37:37.660 --> 1:37:41.180\n that found that one in four young adults\n\n1:37:41.180 --> 1:37:43.420\n seriously considered suicide.\n\n1:37:43.420 --> 1:37:47.940\n Now, suicide rates haven't spiked up so much,\n\n1:37:47.940 --> 1:37:51.420\n but the depths of despair that would lead somebody\n\n1:37:51.420 --> 1:37:53.420\n to seriously consider suicide itself\n\n1:37:53.420 --> 1:37:57.820\n should be a source of great concern in public health.\n\n1:37:57.820 --> 1:38:01.460\n Yeah, this is one of the troubling things about measuring\n\n1:38:01.460 --> 1:38:06.220\n well being is we're okay at measuring death and suicide.\n\n1:38:06.220 --> 1:38:08.980\n We're not so good at measuring suffering.\n\n1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:13.980\n It's like people talk about maybe even Holodomor\n\n1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:19.500\n under Stalin or the concentration camps with Hitler.\n\n1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:23.940\n We talk about deaths, but we don't talk about the suffering\n\n1:38:23.940 --> 1:38:27.740\n over periods of years by people living in fear,\n\n1:38:27.740 --> 1:38:30.980\n by people starving, psychological trauma\n\n1:38:30.980 --> 1:38:33.900\n that lasts a lifetime, all of those things.\n\n1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:36.460\n I mean, and just to get back to that point,\n\n1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:38.540\n we closed schools, especially in blue states,\n\n1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:40.120\n we closed schools.\n\n1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:42.300\n Now, richer parents could send their kids\n\n1:38:42.300 --> 1:38:44.100\n to private schools, many of which stayed open\n\n1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:45.060\n even in the blue states.\n\n1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:47.060\n They could get pods, they could get tutors,\n\n1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:50.580\n but that's not true for poor and middle class parents.\n\n1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:54.540\n And as a result, what we did is we took away\n\n1:38:54.540 --> 1:38:56.060\n life opportunities for kids.\n\n1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:59.420\n We tried to teach five year olds to read via Zoom\n\n1:38:59.420 --> 1:39:01.740\n in kindergarten, right?\n\n1:39:02.780 --> 1:39:05.240\n And the consequence actually, you think, okay,\n\n1:39:05.240 --> 1:39:07.260\n we can just make it up, but it's really difficult\n\n1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:08.980\n to make that up.\n\n1:39:08.980 --> 1:39:12.420\n There's a literature in health economics that shows\n\n1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:17.420\n that even relatively small disruptions in schooling\n\n1:39:18.620 --> 1:39:21.140\n can have lifelong consequences, negative consequences\n\n1:39:21.140 --> 1:39:22.500\n for kids, right?\n\n1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:27.340\n So they end up growing up poorer, they lead shorter lives\n\n1:39:27.340 --> 1:39:30.180\n and less healthy lives as a consequence.\n\n1:39:30.180 --> 1:39:32.740\n And that's what the literature now shows is likely to happen\n\n1:39:32.740 --> 1:39:35.740\n with the interruptions of schooling that we had\n\n1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:36.700\n in the United States.\n\n1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:39.180\n Many European countries actually managed to avoid this.\n\n1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:40.860\n There were in the early days of the epidemic\n\n1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:43.660\n great indications that children first were not\n\n1:39:43.660 --> 1:39:46.660\n very severely at risk from COVID itself,\n\n1:39:46.660 --> 1:39:48.160\n nor are they super spreaders.\n\n1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:51.620\n Schools were not the source of community spread,\n\n1:39:51.620 --> 1:39:54.860\n communities spread the disease to schools,\n\n1:39:54.860 --> 1:39:56.160\n not the other way around.\n\n1:39:57.460 --> 1:39:59.300\n And we can talk about the scientific base of that\n\n1:39:59.300 --> 1:40:01.720\n if you'd like, but that was pretty well known\n\n1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:02.780\n even in October.\n\n1:40:04.580 --> 1:40:06.700\n We closed hospitals in order to keep them\n\n1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:10.980\n available to COVID patients, but as a result,\n\n1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:14.140\n women skipped breast cancer screening.\n\n1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.980\n As a result, they are showing up with late stage\n\n1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:19.660\n breast cancer that should have been picked up last year.\n\n1:40:19.660 --> 1:40:21.860\n Men and women skipped colon cancer screening,\n\n1:40:21.860 --> 1:40:24.160\n again, with later stage disease that should have been\n\n1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:26.180\n picked up last year with earlier stage.\n\n1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:29.820\n For patients with diabetes, it's very important\n\n1:40:29.820 --> 1:40:33.180\n to have regular screening for blood sugar levels\n\n1:40:33.180 --> 1:40:36.740\n and sort of counseling for lifestyle improvement.\n\n1:40:36.740 --> 1:40:38.140\n And we skipped that.\n\n1:40:38.140 --> 1:40:39.700\n People stayed home with heart attacks\n\n1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:41.520\n and died at home with heart attacks.\n\n1:40:43.460 --> 1:40:47.380\n So you had this like sort of wide range of medical\n\n1:40:47.380 --> 1:40:51.900\n and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored\n\n1:40:51.900 --> 1:40:53.980\n as a result of the lockdowns.\n\n1:40:53.980 --> 1:40:55.880\n Plus there's the economic pain.\n\n1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:00.420\n So like you said, whatever is a good term\n\n1:41:00.420 --> 1:41:05.040\n for the non laptop class, people would lose their jobs.\n\n1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:07.700\n Yes, there might be in the Western world support\n\n1:41:07.700 --> 1:41:11.440\n for them financially, but the big loss there\n\n1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:14.960\n that is perhaps correlated with depression and suicide\n\n1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:19.960\n is loss of meaning, loss of hope for the future,\n\n1:41:19.980 --> 1:41:23.020\n loss of kind of a sense of stability,\n\n1:41:23.020 --> 1:41:26.020\n all the pride you have in being able to make money\n\n1:41:30.060 --> 1:41:32.820\n that allows you to pave your own way in the world.\n\n1:41:32.820 --> 1:41:35.660\n And yes, just having less money than you're used to\n\n1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:37.560\n so your family, your kids are suffering,\n\n1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:38.400\n all those kinds of things.\n\n1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:41.340\n And there's, again, an economics literature on this,\n\n1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:43.660\n on deaths of despair it was called.\n\n1:41:43.660 --> 1:41:45.900\n 2009, there was the great recession.\n\n1:41:45.900 --> 1:41:50.820\n It led to an enormous uptake in overdose from drugs,\n\n1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:55.100\n suicidality, depression, as a result of the job losses\n\n1:41:55.100 --> 1:41:57.580\n that happened during the great recession.\n\n1:41:57.580 --> 1:41:59.140\n Well, that's happening again,\n\n1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:02.700\n like an enormous increase in drug overdoses.\n\n1:42:03.980 --> 1:42:07.900\n That's not an accident, that's a lockdown harm, right?\n\n1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:10.460\n Same thing with the job losses.\n\n1:42:10.460 --> 1:42:12.940\n The job losses, by the way, are like, it's so interesting\n\n1:42:12.940 --> 1:42:15.620\n because the states that stayed open\n\n1:42:15.620 --> 1:42:18.420\n have had much, much lower unemployment\n\n1:42:18.420 --> 1:42:20.740\n than the states that stayed closed.\n\n1:42:20.740 --> 1:42:23.500\n The labor force participation rates declined by 3%.\n\n1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:25.440\n It's women that separated\n\n1:42:25.440 --> 1:42:28.540\n because they stayed home with their kids.\n\n1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.420\n We've reversed a generation of women,\n\n1:42:33.380 --> 1:42:36.300\n improving women's participation in the labor force.\n\n1:42:37.140 --> 1:42:41.140\n Do you think it has to do with the institutions\n\n1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:44.500\n that we mentioned that there was so much priority given\n\n1:42:44.500 --> 1:42:48.260\n or so much power given to maybe NIH\n\n1:42:48.260 --> 1:42:51.700\n versus other civilian leaders?\n\n1:42:51.700 --> 1:42:54.420\n Or do people just not care about the economic pain?\n\n1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:59.380\n The leaders, I mean, because to me it was obvious.\n\n1:42:59.380 --> 1:43:03.540\n I mean, probably it's just studying history.\n\n1:43:03.540 --> 1:43:06.540\n Whenever I listen to people on Twitter\n\n1:43:06.540 --> 1:43:09.820\n or on mainstream news or just anything,\n\n1:43:09.820 --> 1:43:14.380\n I realize that's the very kind of top.\n\n1:43:14.380 --> 1:43:17.220\n The people that have a voice\n\n1:43:17.220 --> 1:43:19.620\n represent a tiny selection of people.\n\n1:43:19.620 --> 1:43:21.740\n And so whenever there's hard times,\n\n1:43:21.740 --> 1:43:26.740\n I always kind of think about the quiet, the voiceless,\n\n1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:30.000\n the quiet suffering of the tens of millions,\n\n1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:31.400\n of the hundreds of millions.\n\n1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:36.380\n Do the political leaders not just give a damn?\n\n1:43:36.380 --> 1:43:39.540\n I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing\n\n1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:41.260\n at the beginning of the pandemic\n\n1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:44.300\n where if you brought up economic harms at all,\n\n1:43:44.300 --> 1:43:45.940\n you were seen as callous.\n\n1:43:47.620 --> 1:43:50.040\n So I had a reporter call me up\n\n1:43:50.040 --> 1:43:51.580\n almost at the very beginning of the epidemic\n\n1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:56.580\n asking me about a very particular phenomenon.\n\n1:43:56.900 --> 1:44:00.640\n So he was anticipating a rise in child abuse\n\n1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:02.300\n because children were gonna be staying at home.\n\n1:44:02.300 --> 1:44:04.980\n Child abuse is generally picked up at school.\n\n1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:06.020\n And that actually happened.\n\n1:44:06.020 --> 1:44:08.500\n So the reported child abuse dropped,\n\n1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:10.260\n but actual child abuse increased\n\n1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:14.100\n because normally you pick up the child abuse at school\n\n1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:16.080\n and that you have the intervention, right?\n\n1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:17.920\n So yeah, so I was talking about like,\n\n1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:19.100\n well, there's gonna be some economic harms\n\n1:44:19.100 --> 1:44:20.180\n and they're gonna have health consequences,\n\n1:44:20.180 --> 1:44:21.740\n but the economic harms matter.\n\n1:44:21.740 --> 1:44:24.540\n But he counseled me.\n\n1:44:24.540 --> 1:44:27.460\n And I think he had my best interest at heart.\n\n1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:29.500\n Like if you were to put that in the story,\n\n1:44:29.500 --> 1:44:31.700\n I would be, I'd essentially be canceled.\n\n1:44:31.700 --> 1:44:36.340\n Because what the narrative that arose in March of 2020\n\n1:44:36.340 --> 1:44:39.700\n is if you care about money at all,\n\n1:44:39.700 --> 1:44:43.700\n you're evil and crass, you must only care about lives.\n\n1:44:43.700 --> 1:44:46.340\n The problem with that narrative is that that money,\n\n1:44:46.340 --> 1:44:47.340\n which we're talking about,\n\n1:44:47.340 --> 1:44:51.540\n is actually lives of poor people, right?\n\n1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:54.660\n When you throw 100 million people around the world\n\n1:44:54.660 --> 1:44:58.060\n into poverty, you're going to see enormous harm\n\n1:44:58.060 --> 1:45:01.260\n to their health, enormous increases in their mortality.\n\n1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:04.860\n It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that\n\n1:45:04.860 --> 1:45:07.300\n in the context of this pandemic response.\n\n1:45:07.300 --> 1:45:11.020\n Our mind focused so much on COVID that it forgot\n\n1:45:11.020 --> 1:45:13.540\n that there are so many other public health priorities as well\n\n1:45:13.540 --> 1:45:15.500\n that need our attention desperately.\n\n1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:21.220\n And this is the thing I sensed about San Francisco\n\n1:45:21.220 --> 1:45:24.620\n when I visited, I was thinking of moving there for a startup.\n\n1:45:24.620 --> 1:45:26.580\n This is the thing I'm really afraid of,\n\n1:45:26.580 --> 1:45:30.420\n especially if I have any effect on the world\n\n1:45:30.420 --> 1:45:34.300\n through a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way.\n\n1:45:34.300 --> 1:45:36.980\n That you mentioned the laptop class,\n\n1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:40.260\n living in this world where you're only concerned\n\n1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:44.380\n about this particular class of people.\n\n1:45:44.380 --> 1:45:48.900\n And also, perhaps early on in the pandemic,\n\n1:45:48.900 --> 1:45:50.060\n amongst the laptop class,\n\n1:45:50.060 --> 1:45:51.920\n there was a legitimate concern for health,\n\n1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:55.940\n like you're not sure how deadly this virus is.\n\n1:45:55.940 --> 1:45:58.900\n You're not sure who to listen to, so there's a real concern.\n\n1:45:58.900 --> 1:46:02.060\n And then at a certain point when the data starts coming in,\n\n1:46:02.060 --> 1:46:05.140\n you start becoming more and more detached from the data.\n\n1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:07.300\n You don't start caring less and less,\n\n1:46:07.300 --> 1:46:10.740\n and you start just swimming in the space of narratives,\n\n1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:12.420\n like existing in the space of narratives,\n\n1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:15.420\n and you have this narrative in San Francisco\n\n1:46:15.420 --> 1:46:19.660\n in the laptop class that you just are very proud\n\n1:46:19.660 --> 1:46:21.180\n that you know the truth,\n\n1:46:21.180 --> 1:46:22.940\n you're the sole possessors of the truth,\n\n1:46:22.940 --> 1:46:25.140\n you congratulate yourself on it,\n\n1:46:25.140 --> 1:46:28.940\n and you don't care what actually gigantic detrimental effect\n\n1:46:28.940 --> 1:46:33.120\n that has on society, because you're mostly fine.\n\n1:46:34.460 --> 1:46:36.840\n I'm so terrified of that.\n\n1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.500\n Well, actually, I think the antidote to that\n\n1:46:38.500 --> 1:46:39.760\n is just to remember.\n\n1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:40.600\n You remember.\n\n1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:41.920\n Yeah. Yeah.\n\n1:46:41.920 --> 1:46:44.020\n I don't think, you know, remember where you came from\n\n1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:46.380\n and remember who you're doing this for.\n\n1:46:46.380 --> 1:46:48.000\n At the back of your head should always be,\n\n1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:49.520\n what's the purpose?\n\n1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:50.780\n Like, why am I here?\n\n1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:51.740\n What's the purpose of this?\n\n1:46:51.740 --> 1:46:56.540\n And if the purpose is simply self aggrandizement,\n\n1:46:56.540 --> 1:46:57.660\n then you should rethink,\n\n1:46:57.660 --> 1:46:59.960\n because it'll just end up being a hollow life.\n\n1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:03.180\n All of us will be forgotten in the end.\n\n1:47:04.860 --> 1:47:08.580\n Focused protection, the idea, the policy,\n\n1:47:08.580 --> 1:47:09.980\n what is focused protection?\n\n1:47:09.980 --> 1:47:12.900\n Right, so I was saying that there's two scientific bases,\n\n1:47:12.900 --> 1:47:15.140\n right, so one is this steep age gradient,\n\n1:47:15.140 --> 1:47:17.100\n and the second is the existence of locked arms.\n\n1:47:17.100 --> 1:47:19.260\n Again, I think there's very little disagreement\n\n1:47:19.260 --> 1:47:22.360\n in the scientific community on both of those facts.\n\n1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:24.540\n If you put those facts together,\n\n1:47:24.540 --> 1:47:27.780\n the obvious policy is to protect the people\n\n1:47:27.780 --> 1:47:31.620\n who are at the most severe risk from the disease itself.\n\n1:47:31.620 --> 1:47:33.100\n And that's the idea of focused protection.\n\n1:47:33.100 --> 1:47:35.180\n That's the general principle of it.\n\n1:47:35.180 --> 1:47:37.420\n The actual implementation of it\n\n1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:39.800\n depends on the living circumstances\n\n1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.700\n of the people that are at risk,\n\n1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:44.100\n the resources that are available in the community,\n\n1:47:44.100 --> 1:47:47.800\n the technology that's available to do this.\n\n1:47:49.380 --> 1:47:51.900\n And so it's almost always going to be,\n\n1:47:51.900 --> 1:47:54.900\n in fact, it'll always be a local thing,\n\n1:47:54.900 --> 1:47:58.340\n because it'll depend on all of those things\n\n1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:00.340\n which are all local in nature.\n\n1:48:00.340 --> 1:48:02.900\n Right, so one very, very obvious thing,\n\n1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:04.820\n in a country like ours,\n\n1:48:04.820 --> 1:48:08.140\n where so many older people live in institutionalized settings\n\n1:48:08.140 --> 1:48:09.380\n and nursing home settings,\n\n1:48:10.540 --> 1:48:13.100\n and that's where older, really vulnerable,\n\n1:48:13.100 --> 1:48:14.900\n chronically ill patients often live,\n\n1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:18.340\n and you know this disease affects that group,\n\n1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:21.260\n most commonly, it is absolutely vital\n\n1:48:21.260 --> 1:48:22.540\n to protect that group.\n\n1:48:23.620 --> 1:48:26.780\n We should have known that in February 2020,\n\n1:48:26.780 --> 1:48:28.140\n just from the Chinese data.\n\n1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:33.220\n And we should have thought about that group\n\n1:48:33.220 --> 1:48:37.720\n as the key constraint in our policymaking.\n\n1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:41.780\n Instead, we thought about, in February and March 2020,\n\n1:48:41.780 --> 1:48:44.900\n as hospital beds as the key constraint.\n\n1:48:44.900 --> 1:48:46.940\n Hospital beds and ventilator shortages,\n\n1:48:46.940 --> 1:48:49.900\n and so we ran around trying to address\n\n1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:53.500\n that constraint, like a linear programming problem,\n\n1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:55.340\n you figure out which constraint's binding\n\n1:48:55.340 --> 1:48:56.500\n and you address that one thing\n\n1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:58.800\n and then you go on to the next one, right?\n\n1:48:58.800 --> 1:49:00.700\n If that one constraint,\n\n1:49:00.700 --> 1:49:03.100\n we said, okay, the constraint is hospital beds.\n\n1:49:04.260 --> 1:49:08.300\n That led to the decision in many of the Northeast states\n\n1:49:08.300 --> 1:49:12.420\n to send COVID infected patients who were on the verge\n\n1:49:12.420 --> 1:49:14.420\n or looked like they were about to recover\n\n1:49:14.420 --> 1:49:15.900\n back to nursing homes,\n\n1:49:17.300 --> 1:49:19.260\n who then spread the disease all through there,\n\n1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:21.820\n because they wanted to preserve the hospital beds.\n\n1:49:21.820 --> 1:49:25.260\n Well, for somebody who loves numerical optimization,\n\n1:49:25.260 --> 1:49:26.700\n I love the way you frame this.\n\n1:49:27.980 --> 1:49:30.380\n But those are kind of connected, right?\n\n1:49:30.380 --> 1:49:33.780\n If you actually focus on protecting the vulnerable,\n\n1:49:33.780 --> 1:49:36.500\n you will also have the effect\n\n1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:40.820\n of not hitting the ceiling of the available hospital beds.\n\n1:49:40.820 --> 1:49:41.660\n That's the irony.\n\n1:49:41.660 --> 1:49:44.180\n If we protected the vulnerable,\n\n1:49:44.180 --> 1:49:47.140\n the vulnerable are the most likely to be hospitalized,\n\n1:49:47.140 --> 1:49:48.700\n and so by protecting the hospital,\n\n1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:49.900\n by protecting the vulnerable,\n\n1:49:49.900 --> 1:49:53.080\n we will also have addressed the shortage of hospital beds\n\n1:49:53.080 --> 1:49:53.920\n more effectively.\n\n1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:55.620\n So that little shift in priority\n\n1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:57.740\n would have had a big impact.\n\n1:49:57.740 --> 1:50:01.740\n Okay, but specifically, the idea is to,\n\n1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:03.700\n and we could talk about different ideas\n\n1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:04.660\n of how to actually do this,\n\n1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:09.660\n but you basically do a lockdown or something like that\n\n1:50:10.100 --> 1:50:12.260\n on a very small set of people.\n\n1:50:12.260 --> 1:50:13.300\n You may have to do that\n\n1:50:13.300 --> 1:50:14.900\n if community spread is very high,\n\n1:50:14.900 --> 1:50:18.540\n but generally, I think it would depend on, again,\n\n1:50:18.540 --> 1:50:20.460\n the living circumstances and the,\n\n1:50:20.460 --> 1:50:23.340\n so for instance, if you are in a,\n\n1:50:23.340 --> 1:50:25.440\n if you have a, here's a very simple idea\n\n1:50:25.440 --> 1:50:28.260\n that doesn't require a lockdown forced on them.\n\n1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:29.340\n I don't actually generally,\n\n1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:31.100\n I'm not in favor of that kind of forced lockdown\n\n1:50:31.100 --> 1:50:33.060\n because you just won't get cooperation.\n\n1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:36.300\n But what you could do is provide resources\n\n1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:38.040\n to that group of people.\n\n1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:42.460\n So imagine you live next door to somebody, an older couple,\n\n1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:46.300\n and there's high community spread.\n\n1:50:46.300 --> 1:50:48.940\n Well, they have to go grocery shopping.\n\n1:50:48.940 --> 1:50:50.940\n We did like, some communities did these\n\n1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:53.780\n like senior only grocery hour, right?\n\n1:50:53.780 --> 1:50:55.100\n But they have to still have to go out\n\n1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:56.780\n and they might get exposed\n\n1:50:56.780 --> 1:50:59.640\n when they're shopping amongst other seniors.\n\n1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:03.400\n Well, why not organized home delivery of groceries to them?\n\n1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:06.380\n We did that for the laptop class, right?\n\n1:51:06.380 --> 1:51:09.060\n Or you can even just use a volunteer effort.\n\n1:51:09.060 --> 1:51:10.220\n The older people living next door,\n\n1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:11.060\n just call them up and say,\n\n1:51:11.060 --> 1:51:13.580\n can I help you go out and go shopping for you?\n\n1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:16.500\n And so you would have potentially federal support\n\n1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:17.340\n of that kind of thing.\n\n1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:19.500\n So these kinds of efforts.\n\n1:51:19.500 --> 1:51:22.100\n Identify where the vulnerable people live.\n\n1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:24.580\n It's really challenging in multigenerational homes.\n\n1:51:24.580 --> 1:51:25.580\n In LA County, for instance,\n\n1:51:25.580 --> 1:51:28.780\n there's a lot of older people living together\n\n1:51:28.780 --> 1:51:31.460\n with younger people in relatively crowded,\n\n1:51:31.460 --> 1:51:34.120\n there it's really quite a challenge.\n\n1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.780\n But there again, you can use resources.\n\n1:51:35.780 --> 1:51:40.780\n So if grandma is worried that grandson has come home,\n\n1:51:40.780 --> 1:51:42.000\n but is potentially been exposed,\n\n1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:43.660\n grandson calls grandma says, I mean,\n\n1:51:43.660 --> 1:51:47.140\n I might've been at a party where COVID was.\n\n1:51:47.140 --> 1:51:49.140\n Grandma calls public health, public health,\n\n1:51:49.140 --> 1:51:50.700\n and says, okay, you can have this hotel room\n\n1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:54.340\n for a couple of days until you check to turn negative.\n\n1:51:54.340 --> 1:51:56.060\n In case it wasn't clear,\n\n1:51:56.060 --> 1:51:58.620\n the idea of focused protection\n\n1:51:58.620 --> 1:52:03.100\n is the people that are vulnerable, protect them.\n\n1:52:03.100 --> 1:52:06.180\n And everybody else goes on with their lives,\n\n1:52:06.180 --> 1:52:09.780\n open up the economy, just do as it was before.\n\n1:52:09.780 --> 1:52:10.960\n There was still fear abroad.\n\n1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:12.900\n So there still would be some restrictions\n\n1:52:12.900 --> 1:52:14.100\n that people would pose on themselves.\n\n1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:15.760\n They probably would go to parties less.\n\n1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:19.360\n The grandsons probably wouldn't go so many parties, right?\n\n1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.500\n There would be less participation in big gatherings.\n\n1:52:23.500 --> 1:52:25.140\n And you may even say like big gatherings\n\n1:52:25.140 --> 1:52:27.500\n in order to restrict community spread again.\n\n1:52:27.500 --> 1:52:29.380\n I'm not against any of that,\n\n1:52:29.380 --> 1:52:31.820\n but you shouldn't be closing businesses.\n\n1:52:31.820 --> 1:52:34.020\n You shouldn't be closing churches and synagogues.\n\n1:52:34.020 --> 1:52:38.560\n You shouldn't be forcing people to not go to school.\n\n1:52:38.560 --> 1:52:41.340\n You should not be shuttering businesses.\n\n1:52:41.340 --> 1:52:44.060\n You should just allow society to go on.\n\n1:52:44.060 --> 1:52:46.900\n Some disease will spread, but as we've seen,\n\n1:52:46.900 --> 1:52:50.100\n the lockdown didn't stop the disease from spreading anyways.\n\n1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:50.940\n Right.\n\n1:52:50.940 --> 1:52:54.100\n So what do you make of the criticism that this idea,\n\n1:52:54.100 --> 1:52:59.100\n like all good ideas cannot actually be implemented\n\n1:52:59.740 --> 1:53:01.300\n in a heterogeneous society\n\n1:53:01.300 --> 1:53:03.660\n where there's a lot of people intermixing?\n\n1:53:03.660 --> 1:53:06.400\n And once you open it up,\n\n1:53:06.400 --> 1:53:09.380\n people like the younger people will just forget\n\n1:53:09.380 --> 1:53:11.140\n that this is even existing.\n\n1:53:11.140 --> 1:53:13.060\n And they'll stop caring about the older people\n\n1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:14.300\n and mess up the whole thing.\n\n1:53:14.300 --> 1:53:16.820\n And the government will not want to fund\n\n1:53:16.820 --> 1:53:18.900\n any kind of the great efforts you're talking about\n\n1:53:18.900 --> 1:53:21.980\n about food delivery and then the food delivery services\n\n1:53:21.980 --> 1:53:24.460\n be like, why the heck am I helping out on this anyway?\n\n1:53:24.460 --> 1:53:26.740\n Because like, it's not making me much money.\n\n1:53:26.740 --> 1:53:30.560\n And so therefore like all good ideas, it will collapse.\n\n1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:31.400\n That might be true.\n\n1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:34.000\n I mean, I think it's always a risk with policy thing,\n\n1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:37.180\n but I think if you think back to the moment,\n\n1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:39.060\n but we actually felt like we were in this together\n\n1:53:39.060 --> 1:53:39.900\n to some extent.\n\n1:53:39.900 --> 1:53:40.800\n Yes.\n\n1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:44.460\n Right, I think that that empathy that we had\n\n1:53:44.460 --> 1:53:48.820\n that was used to like tell people to stay in\n\n1:53:48.820 --> 1:53:51.260\n and like happily, not go in happily,\n\n1:53:51.260 --> 1:53:55.000\n but like stay in to like wear a mask\n\n1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.100\n or to do all these things that we thought\n\n1:53:57.100 --> 1:53:59.820\n would help other people could have been redirected\n\n1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:02.860\n to actually helping the people who most needed to be helped.\n\n1:54:02.860 --> 1:54:06.960\n Especially, I do remember March.\n\n1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:10.460\n So this is even way before Barrington,\n\n1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:11.740\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:54:12.580 --> 1:54:16.100\n March, April, May, there was a feeling like\n\n1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:20.860\n if we all just work together, we'll solve this.\n\n1:54:20.860 --> 1:54:24.380\n And that maybe started to, when did that start breaking down?\n\n1:54:24.380 --> 1:54:28.740\n I mean, unfortunately the election is mixed into this.\n\n1:54:28.740 --> 1:54:30.900\n That it became politicized.\n\n1:54:30.900 --> 1:54:32.860\n But I think it lasted quite a long time.\n\n1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:33.880\n I think into the summer,\n\n1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:36.740\n I think there was some of that sense.\n\n1:54:36.740 --> 1:54:39.820\n I don't know, it obviously varied among different people.\n\n1:54:39.820 --> 1:54:42.380\n But I think that it's true it would have been challenging.\n\n1:54:42.380 --> 1:54:44.860\n It's also true that it's heterogeneous,\n\n1:54:44.860 --> 1:54:46.820\n exactly the way you said.\n\n1:54:46.820 --> 1:54:49.860\n But what that means is you need a local response,\n\n1:54:49.860 --> 1:54:53.460\n a response, so like my vision of a public health officer\n\n1:54:53.460 --> 1:54:56.460\n is someone that understands their community,\n\n1:54:56.460 --> 1:54:59.200\n not necessarily the nation at large, but their community,\n\n1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:01.420\n and then works within their community\n\n1:55:01.420 --> 1:55:03.300\n to figure out how to deploy the resources\n\n1:55:03.300 --> 1:55:04.500\n that they have available\n\n1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.140\n to do the kind of protection policies we're talking about.\n\n1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:10.020\n That's what should have happened.\n\n1:55:10.020 --> 1:55:12.740\n Instead, they spent a huge amount of efforts\n\n1:55:12.740 --> 1:55:15.540\n closing, making sure businesses stayed closed.\n\n1:55:15.540 --> 1:55:17.220\n Businesses that, I mean,\n\n1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:20.680\n they're like hardware stores that closed.\n\n1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:22.820\n What good did closing a hardware store do\n\n1:55:23.780 --> 1:55:24.980\n for the spread of COVID?\n\n1:55:24.980 --> 1:55:26.900\n If it had an effect on COVID spread,\n\n1:55:26.900 --> 1:55:28.020\n I mean, it's gonna be March.\n\n1:55:28.020 --> 1:55:30.020\n Checking to make sure that plexiglass\n\n1:55:30.020 --> 1:55:31.100\n was put up everywhere,\n\n1:55:31.100 --> 1:55:32.460\n which now in retrospect turns out\n\n1:55:32.460 --> 1:55:34.840\n to have probably made the disease worse.\n\n1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:40.340\n Masking enforcement, so shaming around masks,\n\n1:55:40.340 --> 1:55:42.500\n I mean, a huge amount of effort on things\n\n1:55:42.500 --> 1:55:47.000\n that were only tangentially related to focus protection.\n\n1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.140\n What if we turned our energy,\n\n1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:52.260\n that enormous energy put into that,\n\n1:55:52.260 --> 1:55:54.460\n instead into focus protection of the vulnerable?\n\n1:55:54.460 --> 1:55:57.100\n That's essentially the conversation I was calling for.\n\n1:55:57.100 --> 1:55:59.380\n And it wasn't, I mean, I didn't think of it\n\n1:55:59.380 --> 1:56:01.020\n as we had every single idea.\n\n1:56:01.020 --> 1:56:03.580\n I mean, we gave some concrete proposals,\n\n1:56:03.580 --> 1:56:05.140\n but the criticism we got was that\n\n1:56:05.140 --> 1:56:07.140\n those concrete proposals weren't enough.\n\n1:56:08.180 --> 1:56:10.220\n And the answer to that is that's true.\n\n1:56:10.220 --> 1:56:11.060\n They weren't enough.\n\n1:56:11.060 --> 1:56:12.660\n I wasn't thinking of them as enough.\n\n1:56:12.660 --> 1:56:15.300\n I was thinking that I wanted to involve\n\n1:56:15.300 --> 1:56:17.980\n an enormous number of people in local public health\n\n1:56:17.980 --> 1:56:20.900\n to help think about how to do focus protection\n\n1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:22.180\n in their communities.\n\n1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:27.180\n The question that's interesting here is about the future too.\n\n1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:32.740\n So COVID has very specific characteristics,\n\n1:56:32.740 --> 1:56:36.180\n like you mentioned, about the curve of the death rate\n\n1:56:36.180 --> 1:56:39.580\n based on the, like it seems like with COVID,\n\n1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:42.140\n it's a little bit easier to actually identify\n\n1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:45.660\n a group of people that you need to protect.\n\n1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:47.940\n So other viruses may not be this way.\n\n1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:52.940\n So might lockdown be a good idea, like hardcore lockdown\n\n1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:57.660\n for a future virus that's 10 times deadlier,\n\n1:56:57.660 --> 1:56:59.780\n but spreads at the same rate as COVID?\n\n1:56:59.780 --> 1:57:02.860\n Or maybe another way to ask that is imagine a virus\n\n1:57:02.860 --> 1:57:06.260\n that's 10 times deadlier, what's the right response?\n\n1:57:06.260 --> 1:57:08.780\n I mean, I think it's always gonna be focus protection,\n\n1:57:08.780 --> 1:57:12.140\n but the group that needs the focus protection may change\n\n1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:14.380\n depending on the biology of the virus, right?\n\n1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:18.580\n So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the US,\n\n1:57:18.580 --> 1:57:22.040\n the great, the people at most risk were children.\n\n1:57:23.220 --> 1:57:24.980\n We didn't know really at the beginning\n\n1:57:24.980 --> 1:57:27.020\n there was this fecal oral spread.\n\n1:57:27.020 --> 1:57:29.220\n And so we did all kinds of crazy things,\n\n1:57:30.340 --> 1:57:33.580\n including like spraying DDT in communities,\n\n1:57:33.580 --> 1:57:37.020\n which somehow was supposed to get rid of polio.\n\n1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:40.020\n But the focus was on whenever there was an outbreak,\n\n1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:42.060\n they would close the school down.\n\n1:57:42.060 --> 1:57:43.700\n And that was the right thing to do\n\n1:57:43.700 --> 1:57:48.700\n because that group that needed protection was children.\n\n1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:51.980\n And the disease was spread, we thought in schools.\n\n1:57:53.620 --> 1:57:56.660\n I don't think there's a single formula that works,\n\n1:57:56.660 --> 1:57:59.380\n but there's a single principle that works, right?\n\n1:57:59.380 --> 1:58:02.260\n No matter, it's hard to imagine a disease\n\n1:58:02.260 --> 1:58:05.420\n that's uniformly deadly across every group\n\n1:58:05.420 --> 1:58:07.220\n in every single person.\n\n1:58:07.220 --> 1:58:09.700\n There's always gonna be some group\n\n1:58:09.700 --> 1:58:13.700\n that's differentially harmed.\n\n1:58:13.700 --> 1:58:14.840\n There's always gonna be some group\n\n1:58:14.840 --> 1:58:16.260\n that's differentially protected.\n\n1:58:16.260 --> 1:58:17.980\n And that may change over time, right?\n\n1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:22.980\n So like in this disease, in this epidemic,\n\n1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:25.840\n as people got infected and recovered,\n\n1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:27.180\n we now had a class of people\n\n1:58:27.180 --> 1:58:29.700\n that were pretty well protected against the disease.\n\n1:58:30.900 --> 1:58:34.360\n They should be, like instead of ostracizing them\n\n1:58:34.360 --> 1:58:36.020\n because they don't want a vaccine,\n\n1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:37.780\n we should be allowing them to work.\n\n1:58:37.780 --> 1:58:41.300\n I mean, we're having staffing shortages in hospitals now\n\n1:58:41.300 --> 1:58:43.320\n because we forgot that principle.\n\n1:58:43.320 --> 1:58:46.580\n Is quite a bit of this a technology problem?\n\n1:58:46.580 --> 1:58:47.620\n So being able to,\n\n1:58:49.700 --> 1:58:52.540\n how much of it is a sociological problem?\n\n1:58:53.940 --> 1:58:56.380\n How much of it is a technology problem?\n\n1:58:56.380 --> 1:58:59.100\n Like where do you put the blame\n\n1:58:59.100 --> 1:59:01.420\n sort of on why this didn't go so great\n\n1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:04.160\n and how it can go great in the beginning?\n\n1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:05.420\n I mean, think about lockdowns.\n\n1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:06.980\n Like if we didn't have Zoom,\n\n1:59:06.980 --> 1:59:08.620\n we wouldn't have lockdowns.\n\n1:59:08.620 --> 1:59:11.580\n There's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock down.\n\n1:59:11.580 --> 1:59:13.740\n I mean, we didn't have the technology to replace work\n\n1:59:13.740 --> 1:59:17.020\n with this remote technology.\n\n1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:21.340\n So we had good lockdown technology in Zoom.\n\n1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:25.320\n We didn't have good focus protection technology.\n\n1:59:25.320 --> 1:59:26.260\n Yeah, I mean, focus protection\n\n1:59:26.260 --> 1:59:27.340\n is always gonna be complicated,\n\n1:59:27.340 --> 1:59:29.500\n especially for something like this that spreads so easily,\n\n1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:30.980\n it's gonna be complicated.\n\n1:59:30.980 --> 1:59:34.980\n And I'm the last person to say it would have been perfect.\n\n1:59:34.980 --> 1:59:37.740\n There would have been people that would have gotten sick,\n\n1:59:37.740 --> 1:59:39.040\n but they got sick anyways.\n\n1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:41.500\n The hope was that if we suppress community spread\n\n1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:44.540\n low enough, we can protect the vulnerable.\n\n1:59:44.540 --> 1:59:47.180\n That was the hope by lockdown.\n\n1:59:47.180 --> 1:59:50.380\n The reality was that only a certain class of people\n\n1:59:50.380 --> 1:59:51.820\n were able to benefit from lockdown.\n\n1:59:51.820 --> 1:59:53.820\n The rest of society, we call them essential workers,\n\n1:59:53.820 --> 1:59:55.700\n had to keep working and they got sick.\n\n1:59:56.660 --> 1:59:58.180\n And the disease kept spreading.\n\n1:59:58.180 --> 2:00:00.280\n It didn't actually have a substantial effect\n\n2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:05.280\n on community spread in non laptop class populations.\n\n2:00:05.980 --> 2:00:08.380\n And also we should probably expand the class of people\n\n2:00:08.380 --> 2:00:12.220\n we call vulnerable to those who would suffer,\n\n2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:14.440\n who have the capacity to suffer,\n\n2:00:15.700 --> 2:00:19.060\n given the policies you're weighing.\n\n2:00:19.060 --> 2:00:22.700\n It's very disingenuous to call the vulnerable\n\n2:00:22.700 --> 2:00:26.180\n just the people, obviously we had the very specific meaning,\n\n2:00:26.180 --> 2:00:31.180\n but broadly speaking, vulnerable should include anybody\n\n2:00:31.740 --> 2:00:34.780\n who can suffer based on the policies you take\n\n2:00:34.780 --> 2:00:36.980\n in response to a virus.\n\n2:00:36.980 --> 2:00:39.100\n That principle you just said is completely agree with\n\n2:00:39.100 --> 2:00:41.580\n is something I think has been lost.\n\n2:00:42.820 --> 2:00:44.260\n And unfortunately lost, right?\n\n2:00:44.260 --> 2:00:49.260\n So the policies themselves, if they have harm,\n\n2:00:49.380 --> 2:00:53.460\n those are real and we shouldn't pretend like they're not.\n\n2:00:53.460 --> 2:00:57.380\n And essentially demonize the people that suffer them.\n\n2:00:58.180 --> 2:01:01.500\n Or pretend, I mean like a lot of times like the depression\n\n2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:02.720\n that we've been talking about,\n\n2:01:02.720 --> 2:01:06.020\n that's thought of as like not so important,\n\n2:01:06.020 --> 2:01:07.020\n but it is important.\n\n2:01:08.380 --> 2:01:12.460\n And especially the harm to the people in poor countries,\n\n2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:14.820\n it's like been out of sight, out of mind\n\n2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:16.900\n in much of the rich parts of the world.\n\n2:01:16.900 --> 2:01:20.140\n Once again, I've hoped that we seeing this,\n\n2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:22.980\n learning lessons of history with the communication tools\n\n2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.260\n who have now will learn this.\n\n2:01:24.260 --> 2:01:26.180\n It's like going to another country\n\n2:01:26.180 --> 2:01:29.380\n and bombing targeted terrorist locations,\n\n2:01:29.380 --> 2:01:32.100\n and there's going to be some civilians who die,\n\n2:01:32.100 --> 2:01:37.100\n pretending that the child who watches their dad die\n\n2:01:37.740 --> 2:01:40.620\n is not going to grow up, first of all, traumatized,\n\n2:01:40.620 --> 2:01:43.700\n but second of all, potentially bring more hate to the world\n\n2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:46.860\n than the hate that you were allegedly fighting\n\n2:01:46.860 --> 2:01:47.700\n in the first place.\n\n2:01:47.700 --> 2:01:52.580\n That's another sort of considering only one kind of harm\n\n2:01:52.580 --> 2:01:54.100\n and not the full range of harms\n\n2:01:54.100 --> 2:01:55.780\n that are being caused by your policies.\n\n2:01:55.780 --> 2:01:59.180\n You know, like the good return to focus protection,\n\n2:01:59.180 --> 2:02:01.700\n we still should be following the policy now for COVID\n\n2:02:01.700 --> 2:02:03.060\n and we're not, right?\n\n2:02:03.060 --> 2:02:06.860\n So the vaccines, there's a great shortage of vaccines.\n\n2:02:06.860 --> 2:02:08.480\n You wouldn't know it in the United States\n\n2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:09.820\n and the rich parts of the world,\n\n2:02:09.820 --> 2:02:11.660\n but there's a great shortage of vaccines.\n\n2:02:11.660 --> 2:02:15.280\n We're not going to be able to vaccinate the most of the,\n\n2:02:15.280 --> 2:02:17.140\n like the entire set of elderly at least,\n\n2:02:17.140 --> 2:02:20.980\n and or larger groups until late 2022.\n\n2:02:20.980 --> 2:02:24.140\n Huge numbers of older people around the world\n\n2:02:24.140 --> 2:02:27.480\n in poor countries that have not COVID recovered yet,\n\n2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:30.940\n so they're still quite vulnerable, have not had the vaccine.\n\n2:02:30.940 --> 2:02:33.500\n And yet we're talking about vaccinating five year olds\n\n2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:37.620\n who benefit, if at all, from the vaccines\n\n2:02:37.620 --> 2:02:38.600\n of just a very little bit\n\n2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:41.100\n because they face such a low risk of harm from COVID.\n\n2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:45.940\n Well, something that's a little bit near and dear\n\n2:02:45.940 --> 2:02:49.280\n to our specific, the two of our hearts.\n\n2:02:49.280 --> 2:02:51.300\n So you're at Stanford.\n\n2:02:51.300 --> 2:02:53.700\n So Stanford recently announced\n\n2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:55.660\n that they're going back to virtual,\n\n2:02:55.660 --> 2:02:59.300\n at least for some period of time in response to the,\n\n2:02:59.300 --> 2:03:01.340\n maybe you can clarify, but I think it's in response\n\n2:03:01.340 --> 2:03:05.380\n to the escalated, how would they phrase it?\n\n2:03:05.380 --> 2:03:06.780\n It's related to Omicron.\n\n2:03:07.860 --> 2:03:12.140\n And a few other universities are kind of like\n\n2:03:12.140 --> 2:03:13.660\n considering back and forth.\n\n2:03:13.660 --> 2:03:16.580\n In my perspective, as somebody who loves\n\n2:03:16.580 --> 2:03:21.580\n in person lectures, who sees the value of that\n\n2:03:23.140 --> 2:03:28.140\n to students, to young minds, also looking at the data,\n\n2:03:28.460 --> 2:03:33.460\n seems the risk aversion in university policies\n\n2:03:36.140 --> 2:03:40.900\n around this, given how healthy the student population is,\n\n2:03:40.900 --> 2:03:44.020\n seems not well calibrated.\n\n2:03:44.020 --> 2:03:44.860\n Let's put it this way.\n\n2:03:44.860 --> 2:03:48.100\n Also, pathological is one way to put it.\n\n2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:50.660\n Given that, I believe, depending on the university,\n\n2:03:50.660 --> 2:03:53.140\n but I think many universities require\n\n2:03:53.140 --> 2:03:57.020\n that the student body is vaccinated at this point.\n\n2:03:57.020 --> 2:04:01.060\n So I think it's a big mistake by Stanford to do this.\n\n2:04:01.060 --> 2:04:05.820\n And I'd like to say that because I just hope MIT doesn't.\n\n2:04:07.380 --> 2:04:09.020\n But what are your thoughts about Stanford?\n\n2:04:09.020 --> 2:04:10.140\n Is there a student?\n\n2:04:10.140 --> 2:04:11.340\n I completely agree with you.\n\n2:04:11.340 --> 2:04:14.980\n I think we have failed in our mission\n\n2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:18.860\n to educate our students by this decision.\n\n2:04:18.860 --> 2:04:20.900\n And I think, frankly, just more broadly,\n\n2:04:20.900 --> 2:04:22.980\n I think we failed generally over the course\n\n2:04:22.980 --> 2:04:24.880\n of the last year and a half in living up\n\n2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:26.180\n to our educational mission.\n\n2:04:27.620 --> 2:04:30.980\n In person teaching is vital.\n\n2:04:31.980 --> 2:04:35.300\n Now, I can understand, if you have older faculty,\n\n2:04:35.300 --> 2:04:37.180\n the principle of focus protection says,\n\n2:04:37.180 --> 2:04:40.260\n provide some alternative teaching arrangements for them.\n\n2:04:40.260 --> 2:04:41.380\n That makes sense to me.\n\n2:04:42.580 --> 2:04:44.300\n From the kid's point of view,\n\n2:04:44.300 --> 2:04:46.940\n they're more harmed by not getting the education\n\n2:04:46.940 --> 2:04:50.260\n we promised them than by COVID.\n\n2:04:51.420 --> 2:04:54.740\n So applying this principle of this focus protection,\n\n2:04:54.740 --> 2:04:58.020\n let young professors teach in person.\n\n2:04:58.020 --> 2:04:59.140\n This is before the vaccine.\n\n2:04:59.140 --> 2:05:01.260\n After the vaccine, let everyone teach in person.\n\n2:05:01.260 --> 2:05:02.220\n Yeah, this is the part,\n\n2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:04.580\n I don't understand the discussion we're even having\n\n2:05:04.580 --> 2:05:09.580\n because, okay, let's leave focus protection aside here\n\n2:05:09.580 --> 2:05:12.480\n because that's a brilliant policy for,\n\n2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:15.800\n perhaps for the future when there's no vaccine.\n\n2:05:15.800 --> 2:05:20.160\n Now with the vaccine, I'm misunderstanding something here\n\n2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:24.940\n because we're now in a space that's psychological.\n\n2:05:24.940 --> 2:05:27.700\n It's no longer about biology\n\n2:05:27.700 --> 2:05:30.560\n because with the booster shots,\n\n2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:34.880\n which I believe MIT is now requiring before January,\n\n2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:37.180\n with the booster shots, the data shows,\n\n2:05:37.180 --> 2:05:41.760\n no matter how old you are, the risks are very low\n\n2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:44.760\n for ending up in a hospital\n\n2:05:44.760 --> 2:05:48.020\n relative to all the other risks you face when you're older.\n\n2:05:49.500 --> 2:05:51.480\n I don't understand.\n\n2:05:51.480 --> 2:05:56.480\n Can you explain the policy around closing a university\n\n2:05:57.120 --> 2:06:02.120\n but also just a policy about just being so scared still\n\n2:06:04.680 --> 2:06:06.160\n in the university setting?\n\n2:06:06.160 --> 2:06:09.840\n I think the great universities have done great harm\n\n2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:12.360\n by modeling this kind of behavior.\n\n2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:15.260\n Yes, to me, sorry to keep interrupting,\n\n2:06:15.260 --> 2:06:17.840\n but to me, the university should be the beacon\n\n2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:22.840\n of great behavior, not the beacon of scared, conservative,\n\n2:06:24.600 --> 2:06:26.160\n let's not mess up.\n\n2:06:26.160 --> 2:06:27.000\n Pathological.\n\n2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:27.840\n Let's not make it pathological.\n\n2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:29.860\n Let's not make anybody angry.\n\n2:06:31.040 --> 2:06:33.880\n It should be a place to play in the space of ideas.\n\n2:06:33.880 --> 2:06:37.680\n Yes, so I think the central problem is,\n\n2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:39.080\n actually related to the central problem\n\n2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.360\n of COVID policy more generally,\n\n2:06:41.360 --> 2:06:45.240\n the goal seems to be to stop the disease from spreading\n\n2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:49.700\n rather than to reduce the harm from the disease.\n\n2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:54.040\n If the goal is to stop the disease from spreading,\n\n2:06:54.040 --> 2:06:59.040\n the sad fact is we have no technology to accomplish that.\n\n2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:00.240\n At this point.\n\n2:07:00.240 --> 2:07:01.080\n Yes.\n\n2:07:01.080 --> 2:07:05.160\n Like it's already deeply integrated into human civilization.\n\n2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:07.040\n Well, I mean, it's here forever, right?\n\n2:07:07.040 --> 2:07:11.120\n There's a zero survey of white tail deer in the US.\n\n2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:13.440\n It turns out 80% of white tail deer in the US\n\n2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:15.760\n have COVID antibodies.\n\n2:07:15.760 --> 2:07:18.040\n Dogs get it, cats get it.\n\n2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.880\n There's almost certainly human animal transmission of it.\n\n2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:24.280\n I mean, presumably, I mean, I've heard bats get it,\n\n2:07:24.280 --> 2:07:28.320\n apparently, so you have a situation\n\n2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:30.640\n where you have this disease that's here to stay.\n\n2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:31.480\n Yeah.\n\n2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:33.320\n And the vaccines don't stop the spread of it,\n\n2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:34.600\n the lockdowns don't stop the spread of it.\n\n2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:37.400\n We have no technology to stop the spread of it.\n\n2:07:38.400 --> 2:07:41.000\n And so we're burning the earth trying to stop,\n\n2:07:41.000 --> 2:07:42.980\n do something that's impossible\n\n2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:46.800\n rather than working on what's possible.\n\n2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:51.880\n And so like letting regular college happen,\n\n2:07:51.880 --> 2:07:53.160\n that's a great good.\n\n2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:56.440\n Universities are a wonderful invention\n\n2:07:56.440 --> 2:07:58.820\n and it's contributed so much to society.\n\n2:07:58.820 --> 2:08:00.720\n Just decide to shut it down.\n\n2:08:00.720 --> 2:08:03.360\n The universities should be fighting tooth and nail\n\n2:08:03.360 --> 2:08:05.920\n to not be shut down, not the other way around.\n\n2:08:07.200 --> 2:08:09.380\n Whatever the mechanisms that results\n\n2:08:09.380 --> 2:08:10.480\n in the universities doing that,\n\n2:08:10.480 --> 2:08:12.600\n that's probably, this is me talking,\n\n2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:14.480\n it probably has to do with certain incentives\n\n2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:16.800\n for the administration, probably has to do with lawyers\n\n2:08:16.800 --> 2:08:21.180\n and legal kinds of things to avoid legal trouble.\n\n2:08:21.180 --> 2:08:24.640\n But once again, it's when the administration\n\n2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:27.300\n has too much power and too much definition\n\n2:08:27.300 --> 2:08:29.200\n of what the policy is for the university,\n\n2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:30.760\n that's when you get into trouble.\n\n2:08:30.760 --> 2:08:33.300\n The beauty, the power of the university\n\n2:08:33.300 --> 2:08:36.320\n should be about the faculty and the students.\n\n2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:41.320\n Administration just gets in the way, get out of the way.\n\n2:08:41.400 --> 2:08:43.160\n I mean, they can help organize things.\n\n2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:45.880\n They play some important role, but they certainly do.\n\n2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:47.560\n But they need to remember what the mission is.\n\n2:08:47.560 --> 2:08:50.160\n The mission is not safety.\n\n2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:52.420\n The mission, actually, universities should be\n\n2:08:52.420 --> 2:08:55.980\n dangerous places for ideas and whatnot.\n\n2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:59.220\n What is the role of fear in a pandemic?\n\n2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:00.740\n We've been dancing around it.\n\n2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:01.740\n Is it useful?\n\n2:09:01.740 --> 2:09:03.220\n Is it destructive?\n\n2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:05.860\n Or is there sort of a complicated story here?\n\n2:09:05.860 --> 2:09:10.060\n Because they're taking us back into January 2020.\n\n2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:11.460\n There was so much uncertainty.\n\n2:09:11.460 --> 2:09:16.460\n This could have been a pandemic that is Black Death,\n\n2:09:16.700 --> 2:09:17.820\n the bubonic plague.\n\n2:09:17.820 --> 2:09:21.140\n It could have killed hundreds of millions of people.\n\n2:09:21.140 --> 2:09:22.660\n We don't know that.\n\n2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:24.100\n We're very new to this.\n\n2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:25.180\n It's been a while.\n\n2:09:25.180 --> 2:09:26.540\n We're rusty.\n\n2:09:26.540 --> 2:09:29.460\n So there is some value to fear\n\n2:09:29.460 --> 2:09:31.340\n so that you don't do the stupid thing.\n\n2:09:31.340 --> 2:09:33.120\n You don't just go on living.\n\n2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:34.180\n I guess where I come from,\n\n2:09:34.180 --> 2:09:36.740\n I think it's almost entirely counterproductive.\n\n2:09:36.740 --> 2:09:39.960\n I think fear should never be used as a tactic\n\n2:09:39.960 --> 2:09:44.100\n to manipulate human behavior by public health.\n\n2:09:44.100 --> 2:09:47.100\n So the fear on the individual level,\n\n2:09:47.100 --> 2:09:48.740\n that feeling of fear,\n\n2:09:48.740 --> 2:09:51.140\n you should be very hesitant about that feeling\n\n2:09:51.140 --> 2:09:53.940\n because it could be easily manipulated by the powerful.\n\n2:09:53.940 --> 2:09:54.780\n Exactly.\n\n2:09:54.780 --> 2:09:57.940\n I think that fear is natural.\n\n2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:02.940\n And it's not something that you have to stoke to get\n\n2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:07.060\n when the facts on the ground suggest it, right?\n\n2:10:07.060 --> 2:10:09.220\n In fact, the tendency for humans\n\n2:10:09.220 --> 2:10:12.780\n in the face of threats from infectious disease\n\n2:10:12.780 --> 2:10:16.420\n is to exaggerate the fear in their own minds\n\n2:10:16.420 --> 2:10:19.960\n of being contaminated by the environment and by others.\n\n2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:21.780\n That's just natural to humans.\n\n2:10:21.780 --> 2:10:24.460\n And the role of public health\n\n2:10:24.460 --> 2:10:27.180\n is not necessarily to eradicate the fear,\n\n2:10:27.180 --> 2:10:28.700\n but obviously technological advances\n\n2:10:28.700 --> 2:10:29.820\n can help eradicate the fear,\n\n2:10:29.820 --> 2:10:32.700\n but it's really to help manage that fear\n\n2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:37.700\n and help people put the sort of incentives\n\n2:10:38.580 --> 2:10:40.420\n that come out of that to useful things\n\n2:10:40.420 --> 2:10:41.820\n as opposed to harmful things.\n\n2:10:43.700 --> 2:10:45.380\n What's happened in this pandemic\n\n2:10:45.380 --> 2:10:49.100\n is that there's been a deliberate policy to stoke the fear,\n\n2:10:49.100 --> 2:10:51.420\n to help make people think that the disease\n\n2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:53.580\n is worse than it actually is.\n\n2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:56.060\n In survey after survey, you see this.\n\n2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:58.300\n And that's been incredibly damaging.\n\n2:10:58.300 --> 2:11:02.380\n So young people have readily given away\n\n2:11:02.380 --> 2:11:04.940\n their willingness to participate in regular life\n\n2:11:04.940 --> 2:11:08.260\n because A, they fear COVID more than they ought,\n\n2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:12.020\n and B, they fear that they're gonna harm the vulnerable\n\n2:11:13.060 --> 2:11:14.700\n in their lives.\n\n2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:15.820\n You put those two together\n\n2:11:15.820 --> 2:11:18.340\n and you get this powerful demand for lockdowns.\n\n2:11:18.340 --> 2:11:20.580\n You see this all over the world.\n\n2:11:20.580 --> 2:11:23.460\n Broadly speaking, you have a powerful demand\n\n2:11:23.460 --> 2:11:26.540\n for irrational policies, irrational policies,\n\n2:11:26.540 --> 2:11:29.180\n because I would like to mention the flip side of that.\n\n2:11:29.180 --> 2:11:32.780\n I've been saddened to see how much money\n\n2:11:32.780 --> 2:11:37.540\n there is to be made by the martyrs,\n\n2:11:37.540 --> 2:11:40.660\n the people, the conspiracy theorists\n\n2:11:40.660 --> 2:11:45.660\n that tell you you should be afraid of the government.\n\n2:11:46.140 --> 2:11:49.180\n You should be afraid of the man.\n\n2:11:49.180 --> 2:11:51.700\n It feels like fear is the problem.\n\n2:11:51.700 --> 2:11:53.740\n I think there's some guy that once said something\n\n2:11:53.740 --> 2:11:56.060\n about we should fear fear itself.\n\n2:11:58.900 --> 2:11:59.940\n He was a president or something.\n\n2:11:59.940 --> 2:12:01.740\n I vaguely remember that.\n\n2:12:01.740 --> 2:12:06.100\n So I'm worried about both sides here, that.\n\n2:12:06.100 --> 2:12:07.740\n Well, I think the general principle\n\n2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:11.380\n is that should not be a tool of public policy, right?\n\n2:12:11.380 --> 2:12:13.780\n The public policy should attempt,\n\n2:12:13.780 --> 2:12:15.100\n and public health policy in particular,\n\n2:12:15.100 --> 2:12:16.860\n should attempt to address that fear.\n\n2:12:16.860 --> 2:12:21.860\n It's not that you should tell people lies, of course not.\n\n2:12:22.740 --> 2:12:25.300\n Tell people accurately what the risk is.\n\n2:12:26.460 --> 2:12:29.020\n Give people tools that have evidence\n\n2:12:29.020 --> 2:12:31.020\n that they can address their risk with\n\n2:12:32.540 --> 2:12:36.180\n and level with people when we don't know.\n\n2:12:36.180 --> 2:12:38.780\n I think that is the right adult way\n\n2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:41.620\n to deal with this pandemic from a public health point of view.\n\n2:12:41.620 --> 2:12:44.660\n And that is not the policy we have followed.\n\n2:12:44.660 --> 2:12:47.500\n Instead, public health is intentionally stoked the fear\n\n2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.500\n in order to gain compliance with its edicts.\n\n2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:53.300\n And I think the consequence of that\n\n2:12:53.300 --> 2:12:56.620\n is people distrust public health.\n\n2:12:56.620 --> 2:12:58.620\n What you're talking about, the distrust of government,\n\n2:12:58.620 --> 2:13:00.780\n I think is partly a consequence of that.\n\n2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:03.340\n That movement, which is much smaller once upon a time,\n\n2:13:03.340 --> 2:13:06.940\n is much larger now because of essentially\n\n2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:09.100\n people look at what public health has done\n\n2:13:09.100 --> 2:13:12.220\n and said they've lied to me a whole bunch of times\n\n2:13:12.220 --> 2:13:15.340\n and a whole bunch of things is the general sense.\n\n2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:17.260\n And there are consequences to that.\n\n2:13:17.260 --> 2:13:20.100\n We're gonna have to work in public health for a long time\n\n2:13:20.100 --> 2:13:22.900\n to try to regain the trust of the public.\n\n2:13:22.900 --> 2:13:26.180\n Throughout all of this, you've been inspiring to me,\n\n2:13:26.180 --> 2:13:27.740\n to a lot of people.\n\n2:13:27.740 --> 2:13:32.660\n So you've been fearless, bold,\n\n2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:35.940\n in these kind of challenging the policies\n\n2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:38.980\n and not in a martyr kind of way\n\n2:13:38.980 --> 2:13:42.260\n because you're walking the line gracefully\n\n2:13:42.260 --> 2:13:44.460\n and beautifully, I would say.\n\n2:13:44.460 --> 2:13:49.340\n And looking at that, I think you're an inspiration\n\n2:13:49.340 --> 2:13:50.300\n to a lot of young people.\n\n2:13:50.300 --> 2:13:53.940\n So I have to ask, what advice would you give them\n\n2:13:53.940 --> 2:13:56.500\n if they're thinking of going into science,\n\n2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:59.540\n if they're thinking of having an impact in the world,\n\n2:13:59.540 --> 2:14:02.820\n what advice would you give them about their career\n\n2:14:03.820 --> 2:14:05.900\n and maybe about their life?\n\n2:14:05.900 --> 2:14:07.620\n Thinking about somebody in high school,\n\n2:14:07.620 --> 2:14:09.740\n maybe in undergraduate college.\n\n2:14:09.740 --> 2:14:10.620\n I'd say a few things.\n\n2:14:10.620 --> 2:14:13.180\n One is, this is a wonderful profession.\n\n2:14:13.180 --> 2:14:17.340\n You have an opportunity to improve the lives of so many\n\n2:14:17.340 --> 2:14:19.180\n and do it by having fun,\n\n2:14:19.180 --> 2:14:20.900\n the kind of play we're talking about.\n\n2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:24.060\n It's an absolute privilege to be able to work\n\n2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:25.220\n in this kind of area.\n\n2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:28.580\n And to young people looking to say,\n\n2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:32.740\n that have some gifts or desire for this area,\n\n2:14:32.740 --> 2:14:35.780\n I say, please, go for it.\n\n2:14:35.780 --> 2:14:37.620\n So this area of science broadly.\n\n2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:39.580\n Yeah, I mean, it could be,\n\n2:14:39.580 --> 2:14:41.260\n I mean, I don't have any gifts in AI,\n\n2:14:41.260 --> 2:14:43.180\n but like, it could be your buddy,\n\n2:14:43.180 --> 2:14:46.260\n or in health or in medicine or whatever,\n\n2:14:46.260 --> 2:14:48.340\n whatever your gifts lie, develop them,\n\n2:14:48.340 --> 2:14:49.300\n work hard and develop them,\n\n2:14:49.300 --> 2:14:50.140\n because it's worth it.\n\n2:14:50.140 --> 2:14:54.420\n It's worth it, not just because you get some status,\n\n2:14:54.420 --> 2:14:56.900\n but because the journey is fun.\n\n2:14:56.900 --> 2:15:00.540\n And the result is improvements in the lives of so many.\n\n2:15:00.540 --> 2:15:03.220\n So I think that is the encouragement I give.\n\n2:15:03.220 --> 2:15:06.020\n I'd also say, if you're looking at this ugliness\n\n2:15:06.020 --> 2:15:09.260\n of this debate that's happened over the pandemic,\n\n2:15:09.260 --> 2:15:10.580\n I'd say to young people,\n\n2:15:10.580 --> 2:15:13.780\n we need you to come in and help transform it.\n\n2:15:13.780 --> 2:15:15.100\n Many of the people you see in this debate\n\n2:15:15.100 --> 2:15:18.460\n that behave poorly, I ask you forgive them.\n\n2:15:18.460 --> 2:15:20.260\n I've done my best to try,\n\n2:15:21.740 --> 2:15:25.980\n because many of them are acting out of their own sense\n\n2:15:25.980 --> 2:15:27.380\n that they need to do good,\n\n2:15:27.380 --> 2:15:31.580\n but the mistake they've made is in this arrogance\n\n2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:32.420\n and this power.\n\n2:15:32.420 --> 2:15:34.300\n So when you come in, remember that example\n\n2:15:34.300 --> 2:15:35.780\n as a negative example.\n\n2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:38.220\n And so that when you join the debate,\n\n2:15:38.220 --> 2:15:40.460\n you'll join it in a spirit of humility\n\n2:15:40.460 --> 2:15:42.460\n and a spirit of trying to learn\n\n2:15:42.460 --> 2:15:45.860\n while keeping that love that led you\n\n2:15:45.860 --> 2:15:48.260\n to enter the field in the first place.\n\n2:15:48.260 --> 2:15:52.580\n And yeah, choose forgiveness versus like derision.\n\n2:15:54.460 --> 2:15:57.500\n Like the people that you know have messed up,\n\n2:15:57.500 --> 2:15:59.460\n like give them a pass,\n\n2:15:59.460 --> 2:16:03.380\n because it feels like that's how improvement starts.\n\n2:16:03.380 --> 2:16:05.700\n Funny, I've been thinking this is like,\n\n2:16:05.700 --> 2:16:06.900\n I told you I'm Christian, right?\n\n2:16:06.900 --> 2:16:10.140\n So like God has given me many opportunities\n\n2:16:10.140 --> 2:16:12.700\n to forgive people, learned to practice how to do that.\n\n2:16:12.700 --> 2:16:13.740\n Gave you a gift.\n\n2:16:13.740 --> 2:16:15.500\n It's a very humbling thing, I guess.\n\n2:16:15.500 --> 2:16:19.940\n Is there a memory from when you were young\n\n2:16:19.940 --> 2:16:22.340\n that was very formative to you?\n\n2:16:22.340 --> 2:16:24.580\n So you just gave advice to some young people.\n\n2:16:24.580 --> 2:16:26.460\n Is there something that stands out to you\n\n2:16:26.460 --> 2:16:31.460\n that a decision you made, an event that happened\n\n2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:34.220\n that made you the man you are today?\n\n2:16:35.540 --> 2:16:38.340\n I actually grew up in a relatively poor environment.\n\n2:16:38.340 --> 2:16:42.700\n Like I was born in India and we moved when I was four.\n\n2:16:42.700 --> 2:16:45.380\n My dad had eight brothers and sisters\n\n2:16:46.340 --> 2:16:48.380\n and my mom had four brothers and sisters.\n\n2:16:48.380 --> 2:16:52.380\n She grew up in the slum in Calcutta.\n\n2:16:52.380 --> 2:16:54.820\n My dad, his dad died when he was young\n\n2:16:54.820 --> 2:16:57.260\n and he supported his family, his brothers and sisters\n\n2:16:57.260 --> 2:16:59.180\n with university scholarship money.\n\n2:16:59.180 --> 2:17:02.540\n Came to the US and my dad worked in a McDonald's,\n\n2:17:02.540 --> 2:17:04.100\n even though he's an electrical engineer,\n\n2:17:04.100 --> 2:17:06.580\n couldn't find a job in 1971.\n\n2:17:06.580 --> 2:17:08.220\n And so he worked at McDonald's.\n\n2:17:09.220 --> 2:17:14.220\n We lived in a, like this, basically the housing port\n\n2:17:14.340 --> 2:17:16.940\n like development in Cambridge,\n\n2:17:16.940 --> 2:17:19.020\n this like this middle building on the 17th floor,\n\n2:17:19.020 --> 2:17:20.580\n this like housing development.\n\n2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:25.060\n I mean, I think that was transformative for me.\n\n2:17:25.060 --> 2:17:27.300\n Like I didn't realize so much at the time\n\n2:17:27.300 --> 2:17:32.220\n how that experience of being essentially like poor,\n\n2:17:32.220 --> 2:17:36.300\n lower middle class, what effect it had on my outlook.\n\n2:17:36.300 --> 2:17:37.460\n You mentioned to me offline\n\n2:17:37.460 --> 2:17:38.820\n that you listened to the conversation\n\n2:17:38.820 --> 2:17:40.620\n that I had with my dad.\n\n2:17:40.620 --> 2:17:42.660\n What impact did your dad have on your life?\n\n2:17:42.660 --> 2:17:44.980\n What memories do you have about him?\n\n2:17:44.980 --> 2:17:46.740\n He was a rocket scientist actually.\n\n2:17:46.740 --> 2:17:51.060\n He helped design rocket guidance systems.\n\n2:17:51.060 --> 2:17:55.340\n He died when I was 20 and I still miss him to this day.\n\n2:17:55.340 --> 2:17:58.660\n And I think that experience of seeing him\n\n2:17:58.660 --> 2:18:03.660\n sacrifice himself for his family, brilliant man,\n\n2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:08.580\n but in many ways frustrated with like his opportunities\n\n2:18:08.580 --> 2:18:10.060\n in the world, which is probably what led him\n\n2:18:10.060 --> 2:18:12.820\n to come to the US in the first place.\n\n2:18:12.820 --> 2:18:16.660\n That's transformed, that's had a transformative effect on me\n\n2:18:16.660 --> 2:18:19.380\n and I wish I could tell him that looking back.\n\n2:18:21.660 --> 2:18:25.300\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n2:18:25.300 --> 2:18:26.900\n Do you think about your death?\n\n2:18:26.900 --> 2:18:29.380\n Your dad is no longer with us.\n\n2:18:29.380 --> 2:18:34.380\n You're the old wise sage that represents.\n\n2:18:35.780 --> 2:18:39.820\n I've only worried about death once in this pandemic.\n\n2:18:39.820 --> 2:18:43.100\n Although I've had two, my cousin was 73\n\n2:18:43.100 --> 2:18:47.860\n and my uncle who's 74 died in India during the pandemic.\n\n2:18:47.860 --> 2:18:50.020\n And I grieve them both from COVID.\n\n2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:55.500\n Like the fear of COVID really has only hit me\n\n2:18:55.500 --> 2:18:58.940\n only really once during this and it wasn't for me.\n\n2:18:58.940 --> 2:19:01.020\n And I recognize it's irrational.\n\n2:19:01.020 --> 2:19:04.860\n So on the eve of the Santa Clara County seroprevalence study,\n\n2:19:06.140 --> 2:19:07.940\n it was a really interesting thing\n\n2:19:07.940 --> 2:19:10.700\n because so many people volunteered to help.\n\n2:19:10.700 --> 2:19:15.700\n And my daughter who's 20, I guess she was 19 at the time\n\n2:19:16.660 --> 2:19:18.420\n and my wife also volunteered to help\n\n2:19:18.420 --> 2:19:21.020\n with like various aspects of the study.\n\n2:19:21.020 --> 2:19:22.020\n And so the eve of the study,\n\n2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:24.100\n they were going to go out in public\n\n2:19:24.100 --> 2:19:25.780\n and I didn't know what the death rate was\n\n2:19:25.780 --> 2:19:27.820\n because we hadn't done the study.\n\n2:19:27.820 --> 2:19:30.300\n And I suspected it was lower than people were saying\n\n2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:31.660\n but I didn't know.\n\n2:19:31.660 --> 2:19:33.820\n I knew about the age gradient\n\n2:19:33.820 --> 2:19:37.140\n because I'd seen the Chinese data and my daughter's young\n\n2:19:37.140 --> 2:19:40.900\n but my wife is my age and I didn't know the death rate.\n\n2:19:40.900 --> 2:19:43.620\n And I couldn't sleep the night before.\n\n2:19:43.620 --> 2:19:45.860\n Like what if I'm putting my family,\n\n2:19:45.860 --> 2:19:48.700\n my daughter and my wife at risk\n\n2:19:48.700 --> 2:19:51.100\n because of some activity that I'm doing.\n\n2:19:52.220 --> 2:19:53.420\n It was kind of, I don't know.\n\n2:19:53.420 --> 2:19:54.260\n I mean, it was.\n\n2:19:54.260 --> 2:19:58.700\n So it's worried about the wellbeing of others.\n\n2:19:58.700 --> 2:19:59.540\n Yeah.\n\n2:19:59.540 --> 2:20:00.420\n When you look in the mirror.\n\n2:20:00.420 --> 2:20:01.420\n If I die, I die.\n\n2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:04.180\n I mean, like I just, it's not, again, I'm Christian.\n\n2:20:04.180 --> 2:20:07.940\n So I don't, death is not the end for me, I believe.\n\n2:20:07.940 --> 2:20:10.580\n And so I don't particularly worried about my own death\n\n2:20:10.580 --> 2:20:14.420\n but I do, I mean, I just, I think we can't help\n\n2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:17.540\n but we worry about the wellbeing of our loved ones.\n\n2:20:17.540 --> 2:20:22.180\n So from the perspective of God, then let me ask you,\n\n2:20:23.340 --> 2:20:24.420\n what do you think is the meaning\n\n2:20:24.420 --> 2:20:25.900\n of this whole journey we're on?\n\n2:20:25.900 --> 2:20:28.060\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n2:20:28.060 --> 2:20:29.140\n You know, it's very simple.\n\n2:20:29.140 --> 2:20:30.740\n Love one another.\n\n2:20:30.740 --> 2:20:32.660\n Treat your neighbor as yourself.\n\n2:20:32.660 --> 2:20:34.540\n It's love, as simple as that.\n\n2:20:35.780 --> 2:20:38.220\n Well, I'd love to see a little bit more of that\n\n2:20:38.220 --> 2:20:39.940\n in this pandemic.\n\n2:20:39.940 --> 2:20:44.260\n It's an opportunity for the best of our nature to shine.\n\n2:20:44.260 --> 2:20:46.340\n It's, I've seen some of the worst\n\n2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:49.780\n but I think some of that is just good therapy.\n\n2:20:49.780 --> 2:20:54.780\n And I'm hoping in the end, what we have here is love.\n\n2:20:54.900 --> 2:20:57.580\n At the very least, make your dad proud\n\n2:20:57.580 --> 2:21:01.660\n with some incredible rockets that we're launching.\n\n2:21:01.660 --> 2:21:04.540\n I think you'd get along well with my dad, Lex.\n\n2:21:04.540 --> 2:21:05.900\n I definitely would.\n\n2:21:05.900 --> 2:21:06.740\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:21:06.740 --> 2:21:08.860\n This is an incredible honor to talk to you, Jay.\n\n2:21:08.860 --> 2:21:11.500\n You've been an inspiration to so many people\n\n2:21:11.500 --> 2:21:13.340\n and keep fighting the good fight.\n\n2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:15.740\n Thank you so much for spending your valuable time\n\n2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:16.580\n with me today.\n\n2:21:16.580 --> 2:21:18.460\n Thank you for having me here, appreciate it.\n\n2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:20.100\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:21:20.100 --> 2:21:21.460\n with Jay Bhattacharya.\n\n2:21:21.460 --> 2:21:22.860\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:26.060\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:21:26.060 --> 2:21:29.520\n And now let me leave you some words from Alice Walker.\n\n2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:33.200\n The most common way people give up their power\n\n2:21:33.200 --> 2:21:35.480\n is by thinking they don't have any.\n\n2:21:35.480 --> 2:22:02.480\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
