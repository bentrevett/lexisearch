He has a great Instagram account\n\n00:17.040 --> 00:24.160\n at Huberman Lab where he teaches the world about the brain and the human mind. Also, he's a friend\n\n00:24.160 --> 00:31.080\n and an inspiration in that he shows that you can be humble, giving, and still succeed in the\n\n00:31.080 --> 00:36.720\n science world. Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:36.720 --> 00:43.760\n 8Sleep, a mattress that cools itself and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep. SEMrush,\n\n00:43.760 --> 00:50.720\n the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across, and CashApp, the app I use to send\n\n00:50.720 --> 00:56.240\n money to friends. Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support\n\n00:56.240 --> 01:01.680\n this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I heard from a lot of people about the previous\n\n01:01.680 --> 01:08.720\n conversation I had with Yaron Brook about objectivism. Some people loved it, some people\n\n01:08.720 --> 01:14.560\n hated it. I misspoke in some parts, was more critical on occasion than I'm meant to be,\n\n01:14.560 --> 01:20.080\n didn't push on certain points that I should've, was undereducated or completely unaware about\n\n01:20.080 --> 01:27.120\n some major things that happened in the past or major ideas out there. I bring all that up to say\n\n01:27.120 --> 01:32.960\n that if we are to have difficult conversations, we have to give each other space to make mistakes,\n\n01:32.960 --> 01:39.520\n to learn, to grow. Taking one or two statements from a three hour podcast and suggesting that\n\n01:39.520 --> 01:48.480\n they encapsulate who I am, I was, or ever will be is a standard that we can't hold each other to.\n\n01:48.480 --> 01:52.320\n I don't think anyone could live up to that kind of standard, at least I know I can't.\n\n01:53.040 --> 01:59.040\n The conversation with Yaron is mild relative to some conversations that I will likely have in\n\n01:59.040 --> 02:04.960\n the coming year. Please continue to challenge me, but please try to do so with love and with\n\n02:04.960 --> 02:13.040\n patience. I promise to work my ass off to improve. Whether I'm successful at that or not, we shall\n\n02:13.040 --> 02:18.640\n see.

And now here's my\n\n02:26.080 --> 02:34.160\n conversation with Andrew Huberman. You've mentioned that in your lab at Stanford, you induce stress by\n\n02:34.160 --> 02:40.320\n putting people into a virtual reality and having them go through one of a set of experiences. I\n\n02:40.320 --> 02:48.800\n think you mentioned this on Rogan or with Whitney that scare them. So just on a practical, psychological\n\n02:48.800 --> 02:55.200\n level, and maybe on a philosophical level, what are people afraid of? What are the fears? What\n\n02:55.200 --> 03:00.960\n are these fear experiences that you find to be effective? Yeah, so it depends on the person,\n\n03:00.960 --> 03:06.480\n obviously. And we should probably define fear, right? Because you can, without going too far\n\n03:06.480 --> 03:12.880\n down the rabbit hole of defining these things, you can't really have fear without stress,\n\n03:12.880 --> 03:18.000\n but you could have stress without fear. And you can't really have trauma without fear and stress,\n\n03:18.000 --> 03:22.080\n but you could have fear and stress without trauma. So we can start playing the word game.\n\n03:22.080 --> 03:26.320\n And that actually is one of the motivations for even having a laboratory that studies these things\n\n03:26.320 --> 03:32.720\n is that we really need better physiological, neuroscientific, and operational definitions\n\n03:32.720 --> 03:39.520\n of what these things are. I mean, the field of understanding emotions and states, which is mainly\n\n03:39.520 --> 03:46.400\n what I'm interested in, is very complicated. But we can do away with a lot of complicated debate\n\n03:46.400 --> 03:54.960\n and say in our laboratory, what we're looking for to assign it a value of fear is a big inflection\n\n03:54.960 --> 04:00.480\n in autonomic arousal. So increases in heart rate, increases in breathing, perspiration,\n\n04:00.480 --> 04:07.760\n pupil dilation, all the hallmark signature features of the stress response. And in some cases,\n\n04:07.760 --> 04:11.680\n we have the benefit of getting neurosurgery patients where we've got electrodes in their\n\n04:11.680 --> 04:17.280\n amygdala and their insula and the orbitofrontal cortex down beneath the skull. So these are\n\n04:17.280 --> 04:22.000\n chronically implanted electrodes. We're getting multiunit signals and we can start seeing some\n\n04:22.000 --> 04:31.360\n central features of meaning within the brain. And what's interesting is that as trivial as it might\n\n04:31.360 --> 04:41.600\n seem in listening to it, almost everybody responds to heights and falling from a high virtual place\n\n04:42.320 --> 04:49.120\n with a very strong stress, if not fear response. And that's because the visual vestibular apparatus,\n\n04:49.120 --> 04:53.920\n right? The optic flow and how it links to the balanced semicircular canals of the inner ears,\n\n04:53.920 --> 05:01.040\n all this technical stuff. But really, all of that pulls all your physiology, the feeling that your\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:04.960\n stomach is dropping, the feeling that suddenly you're sweating, even though you're not afraid\n\n05:04.960 --> 05:10.720\n of falling off this virtual platform, but you feel as if you're falling because of the optic flow.\n\n05:10.720 --> 05:16.480\n That one is universal. So we've got a dive with great white sharks experience where you actually\n\n05:16.480 --> 05:21.600\n exit the cage. We went out and did this in the real world and brought back 360 video that's\n\n05:21.600 --> 05:24.560\n built out pretty. Oh, so this is actually 360 video.\n\n05:24.560 --> 05:29.680\n 360 video. And this was important to us, right? So when we decided to set up this platform,\n\n05:29.680 --> 05:35.600\n a lot of the motivation was that a lot of the studies of these things in laboratories,\n\n05:35.600 --> 05:39.040\n I don't want to call them lame because I want to be respectful of the people that did this stuff\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:45.280\n before, but they study fear by showing subjects a picture of a bloody arm or a snake or something\n\n05:45.280 --> 05:50.560\n like that. And it just, unless you have a snake phobia, it just wasn't creating a real enough\n\n05:50.560 --> 05:54.080\n experience. So we need to do something where people aren't going to get injured, but where\n\n05:54.080 --> 05:59.120\n we can tap into the physiology and that thing of presence of people momentarily, not the whole time,\n\n05:59.120 --> 06:06.000\n but momentarily forgetting they're in a laboratory. And so heights will always do it. And if people\n\n06:06.000 --> 06:10.880\n want to challenge me on this, I like to point to that movie, Free Solo, which was wild because\n\n06:10.880 --> 06:16.960\n it's an incredible movie, but I think a lot of its popularity can be explained by a puzzle,\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:22.880\n which is you knew he was going to live when you walked in the theater or you watched it at home.\n\n06:22.880 --> 06:28.960\n You knew before that he survived. And yet it was still scary that people somehow were able to put\n\n06:28.960 --> 06:35.520\n themselves into that experience or into Alex's experience enough that they were concerned or\n\n06:35.520 --> 06:41.040\n worried or afraid at some level. So heights always does it. If we get people who have generalized\n\n06:41.040 --> 06:46.800\n anxiety, these are people who wake up and move through life at a generally higher state of\n\n06:46.800 --> 06:51.760\n autonomic arousal and anxiety, then we can tip them a little bit more easily with things that\n\n06:51.760 --> 06:58.880\n don't necessarily get everyone afraid. Things like claustrophobia, public speaking, that's\n\n06:58.880 --> 07:04.240\n going to vary from person to person. And then if you're afraid of sharks, like my sister for instance\n\n07:04.240 --> 07:08.960\n is afraid of sharks, she won't even come to my laboratory because there's a thing about sharks\n\n07:08.960 --> 07:14.400\n in it. That's how terrified some people are of these specific stimuli, but heights gets them\n\n07:14.400 --> 07:22.400\n every time. Yeah. And I'm terrified of heights. We have you step off a platform, virtual platform,\n\n07:22.400 --> 07:28.160\n and it's a flat floor in my lab, but you're up there. Well, you actually allow them the\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:32.560\n possibility in the virtual world to actually take the leap of faith. Yeah. Maybe I should\n\n07:32.560 --> 07:36.800\n describe a little bit of the experiment. So without giving away too much, in case someone\n\n07:36.800 --> 07:41.120\n wants to be a subject in one of these experiments, we have them playing a cognitive game. It's a\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:45.520\n simple lights out kind of game where you're pointing a cursor and turning out lights on a\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:50.960\n grid, but it gets increasingly complex and it speeds up on them. And there's a failure point\n\n07:50.960 --> 07:56.560\n for everybody where they just can't make the motor commands fast enough. And then we surprise\n\n07:56.560 --> 08:03.040\n people essentially by placing them virtually, all of a sudden they're on a narrow platform between\n\n08:03.040 --> 08:10.080\n two buildings. And then we encourage them or we cue them by talking to them through a microphone\n\n08:10.080 --> 08:17.760\n to continue across that platform to continue the game. And some people, they actually will\n\n08:18.480 --> 08:24.080\n get down on the ground and hold onto a virtual beam that doesn't even exist on a flat floor.\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:29.840\n And so what this really tells us is the power of the brain to enter these virtual states as if\n\n08:29.840 --> 08:35.040\n they were real. And we really think that anchoring the visual and the vestibular, the balance\n\n08:35.040 --> 08:40.000\n components of the nervous system are what bring people into that presence so quickly.\n\n08:40.000 --> 08:43.600\n There's also the potential, and we haven't done this yet to bring in 360 sound.\n\n08:44.320 --> 08:49.200\n So the reason we did 360 video is when we started all this back in 2016,\n\n08:49.200 --> 08:55.760\n a lot of the VR was pretty lame, frankly, it was CGI, it just wasn't real enough. But with 360\n\n08:55.760 --> 08:59.840\n video, we knew that we could get people into this presence where they think they're in a real\n\n08:59.840 --> 09:04.320\n experience more quickly. And our friend Michael Muller, who I was introduced to because of the\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:08.160\n project, I reached out to some friends. Michael Muller is a very famous portrait\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:12.400\n photographer in Hollywood, but he dives with great white sharks and he leaves the cage.\n\n09:12.400 --> 09:19.920\n And so we worked with him to build a 360 video apparatus that we could swim underwater with,\n\n09:19.920 --> 09:25.600\n went out to Guadalupe Island, Mexico, and actually got the experience. It was a lot of fun. There's\n\n09:25.600 --> 09:30.240\n some interesting moments out there of danger, but it came back with that video and built that for\n\n09:30.240 --> 09:33.440\n the sharks. And then we realized we need to do this for everything. We need to do it for heights. We\n\n09:33.440 --> 09:40.880\n need to do it for public speaking, for claustrophobia. And what's missing still is 360 sound where 360\n\n09:40.880 --> 09:47.920\n sound would be, for instance, if I were to turn around and there was a giant attack dog there,\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:52.000\n the moment I would turn around and see it, the dog would growl. But if I turn back toward you,\n\n09:52.560 --> 09:58.720\n then it would be silent. And that brings a very real element to one's own behavior where you\n\n09:58.720 --> 10:03.040\n don't know what's going to happen if you turn a corner. Whereas if there's a dog growling behind\n\n10:03.040 --> 10:08.800\n me and I turn around and then I turn back to you and it's still growling, that might seem like more\n\n10:08.800 --> 10:15.040\n of an impending threat and sustained threat, but actually it's when you start linking your own body\n\n10:15.040 --> 10:20.320\n movements to the experience. So when it's closed loop where my movements and choices are starting\n\n10:20.320 --> 10:25.120\n to influence things and they're getting scarier and scarier, that's when you can really drive\n\n10:25.120 --> 10:30.400\n people's nervous system down these paths of high states of stress and fear. Now we don't want to\n\n10:30.400 --> 10:36.480\n traumatize people obviously, but we also study a number of tools that allow them to calm themselves\n\n10:36.480 --> 10:43.760\n in these environments. So the short answer is height. Well, from a psychology and from a neuroscience\n\n10:43.760 --> 10:49.200\n perspective, this whole construction that you've developed is fascinating. We did this a little\n\n10:49.200 --> 10:56.480\n bit with autonomous vehicles. So to try to understand the decision making process of a\n\n10:56.480 --> 11:02.720\n pedestrian when they cross the road and trying to create an experience of a car, you know, that\n\n11:02.720 --> 11:11.680\n could run you over. So there's the danger there. I was so surprised how real that whole world was.\n\n11:11.680 --> 11:17.440\n And the graphics that we built wasn't ultra realistic or anything, but I was still afraid\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:21.920\n of being hit by a car. Everybody we tested were really afraid of being hit by that car.\n\n11:21.920 --> 11:23.120\n Even though it was all a simulation.\n\n11:23.120 --> 11:29.200\n It was all a simulation. It was kind of boxy actually. I mean, it wasn't like ultra realistic\n\n11:29.200 --> 11:35.520\n simulation. It was fascinating. Looms and heights. So any kind of depth,\n\n11:35.520 --> 11:43.360\n we're just programmed to not necessarily recoil, but to be cautious about that edge and that depth.\n\n11:43.360 --> 11:47.440\n And then looms, things coming at us that are getting larger. There are looming sensing neurons\n\n11:47.440 --> 11:54.640\n even in the retina at a very, very early stage of visual processing. And incidentally, the way\n\n11:54.640 --> 12:00.640\n Muller and folks learn how to not get eaten by great white sharks when you're swimming outside\n\n12:00.640 --> 12:06.080\n the cage is as they start lumbering in, you swim toward them. And they get very confused when you\n\n12:06.080 --> 12:11.360\n loom on them because clearly you're smaller. Clearly they could eat you if they wanted to,\n\n12:11.360 --> 12:16.960\n but there's something about forward movement toward any creature that that creature questions\n\n12:16.960 --> 12:22.240\n whether or not it would be a good idea to generate forward movement toward you. And so that's\n\n12:22.240 --> 12:27.120\n actually the survival tool of these cage exit white shark divers. Are you playing around with,\n\n12:27.120 --> 12:32.320\n like one of the critical things for the autonomous vehicle research is you couldn't do 360 video\n\n12:32.320 --> 12:37.120\n because there's a game theoretic. There's an interactive element that's really necessary.\n\n12:37.120 --> 12:43.600\n So maybe people realize this, maybe they don't, but 360 video, you obviously,\n\n12:44.400 --> 12:48.880\n well, it's actually not that obvious to people, but you can't change the reality that you're\n\n12:48.880 --> 12:55.840\n watching. That's right. So, but you find that that's like, is there something fundamental\n\n12:55.840 --> 13:01.520\n about fear and stress that the interactive element is essential for, or do you find you can,\n\n13:02.720 --> 13:08.240\n you can arouse people with just the video? Great question. It works best to use mixed\n\n13:08.240 --> 13:13.600\n reality. So we have a snake stimulus that I personally don't like snakes at all. I don't\n\n13:13.600 --> 13:17.840\n mind spiders. We also have a spider stimulus, but like snakes, I just don't like them. There's\n\n13:17.840 --> 13:22.960\n something about the, the slithering and the, it just creates a visceral response for me.\n\n13:23.840 --> 13:29.040\n Some people not so much, and they have lower levels of stress and fear in there. But one way\n\n13:29.040 --> 13:36.000\n that we can get them to feel more of that is to use mixed reality where we have an actual physical\n\n13:36.000 --> 13:42.240\n bat and they have to stomp out the snake as opposed to just walk to a little safe corner,\n\n13:42.240 --> 13:46.800\n which then makes the snake disappear. That tends to be not as stressful as if they have\n\n13:46.800 --> 13:50.640\n a physical weapon. And so you've got people in there, you know, banging on the floor against\n\n13:50.640 --> 13:56.400\n this thing. And there's something about engaging that makes it more of a, more of a threat. Now,\n\n13:56.400 --> 14:01.680\n I should also mention that we, we always get the subjective report from the subject of what they\n\n14:01.680 --> 14:06.400\n experienced because we never want to project our own ideas about what they were feeling,\n\n14:06.400 --> 14:11.120\n but that's the beauty of working with humans is you can ask them how they feel and humans aren't\n\n14:11.120 --> 14:16.880\n great at explaining how they feel. But it's a lot easier to understand what they're saying than a\n\n14:16.880 --> 14:23.840\n mouse or a macaque monkey is saying. So it's the best we can do is language plus these physiological\n\n14:23.840 --> 14:28.080\n and neurophysiological signals. Is there something you've learned about yourself about your deepest\n\n14:28.080 --> 14:34.240\n fears? Like you said, snakes, is there something that, like if I were to torture you, I'm, so I'm\n\n14:34.240 --> 14:40.240\n Russian. So, you know, I always kind of think, how can I murder this people that this person\n\n14:40.240 --> 14:46.720\n entered the room, but also how, how can I torture you to get some information out of you? What would\n\n14:46.720 --> 14:50.880\n I go with? Hmm. It's interesting. You should say that I never considered myself claustrophobic,\n\n14:51.760 --> 14:58.960\n but because I don't mind small environments provided they're well ventilated. But I,\n\n14:58.960 --> 15:04.320\n before COVID, I started going to this Russian banya, you know, and then, and I had never been\n\n15:04.320 --> 15:09.440\n to a banya. So, you know, the whole experience of really, really hot sauna and what are they\n\n15:09.440 --> 15:14.960\n called? The plots. They're hitting you with the leaves and it gets really hot and humid in there.\n\n15:14.960 --> 15:19.120\n And there were a couple of times where I thought, okay, this thing is below ground.\n\n15:20.320 --> 15:26.080\n It's in a city where there are a lot of earthquakes. Like if this place crumbled and\n\n15:26.080 --> 15:29.840\n we were stuck in here and I'd start getting a little panicky and I realized, I'm like, I don't\n\n15:29.840 --> 15:35.440\n like small confined spaces with poor ventilation. So I realized I think I have some claustrophobia\n\n15:35.440 --> 15:41.120\n and I wasn't aware of that before. So I've put myself into our own claustrophobia stimulus,\n\n15:41.120 --> 15:46.400\n which involves getting into an elevator and with a bunch of people, virtual people,\n\n15:46.960 --> 15:53.040\n and the elevator gets stalled. And at first you're fine. You feel fine. But then as we start\n\n15:53.040 --> 15:57.520\n modulating the environment and we actually can control levels of oxygen in the environment,\n\n15:57.520 --> 16:03.680\n if we want to, it is really uncomfortable for me. And I never would have thought, you know, I fly,\n\n16:03.680 --> 16:09.760\n I'm comfortable in planes, but it is really uncomfortable. And so I think I've unhatched\n\n16:09.760 --> 16:15.760\n a bit of a claustrophobia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For me as well, probably that one, that one is pretty\n\n16:15.760 --> 16:21.120\n bad. The heights I tried to overcome. So I went to skydiving to try to overcome the fear of heights,\n\n16:21.840 --> 16:26.240\n but that didn't help. Did you jump out? Yeah. Yeah. I jumped out, but it was, it was a,\n\n16:26.240 --> 16:32.240\n it was fundamentally different experience. And I guess there could be a lot of different flavors\n\n16:32.240 --> 16:39.920\n of fear of heights maybe, but the one I have didn't seem to be connected to jumping out of a\n\n16:39.920 --> 16:45.840\n plane is a very different, cause like once you accept that you're going to jump, then it's,\n\n16:45.840 --> 16:54.720\n it's a different thing. I think what I'm afraid of is the moments before it is the scariest part.\n\n16:54.720 --> 16:59.840\n Absolutely. And I don't think that's emphasized in the skydiving experience as much,\n\n16:59.840 --> 17:05.200\n and also just the acceptance of the fact that it's going to happen. So once you accept that\n\n17:05.200 --> 17:10.240\n it's going to happen, it's not as scary. It's the fact that it's not supposed to happen.\n\n17:10.240 --> 17:15.440\n And it might, that's the scary part that I guess I'm not being eloquent in this description,\n\n17:15.440 --> 17:21.040\n but there's something about skydiving that was actually philosophically liberating. I was,\n\n17:21.040 --> 17:28.480\n I was like, wow, it, it was the possibility that you can walk on a surface. And then at a certain\n\n17:28.480 --> 17:33.440\n point there's no surface anymore to walk on. And it's all of a sudden the world becomes\n\n17:33.440 --> 17:40.800\n three dimensional and there's this freedom of floating that the concept of like of earth\n\n17:40.800 --> 17:46.320\n disappears for a brief few seconds. I don't know. That was, that was wild. That was wild,\n\n17:46.320 --> 17:52.240\n but I'm still terrified of heights. So, I mean, one, one thing I want to ask just on fear,\n\n17:52.240 --> 17:59.040\n cause it's so fascinating is have you learned anything about what it takes to overcome fears?\n\n18:00.160 --> 18:04.640\n Yes. And that comes from two, from a, you know, research study standpoint,\n\n18:05.440 --> 18:10.800\n two parallel tracks of research. One was done actually in mice, because we have a mouse lab\n\n18:10.800 --> 18:14.560\n also where we can probe around in different brain areas and try and figure out what interesting\n\n18:14.560 --> 18:19.840\n brain areas we might want to probe around in humans. And a graduate student in my lab,\n\n18:19.840 --> 18:27.920\n she's now at Caltech, Lindsay Saleh, published a paper back in 2018, showing that what at first\n\n18:27.920 --> 18:32.720\n might seem a little bit obvious, but the mechanisms are not, which is that there are really three\n\n18:32.720 --> 18:39.120\n responses to fear. You can pause, you can freeze essentially. You can retreat, you can back up,\n\n18:39.120 --> 18:46.400\n or you can go forward. And there's a single hub of neurons in the midbrain, it's actually not\n\n18:46.400 --> 18:50.080\n the midbrain, but it's in the middle of the thalamus, which is a forebrain structure.\n\n18:51.680 --> 18:56.560\n And depending on which neurons are active there, there's a much higher probability that a mouse,\n\n18:56.560 --> 19:02.240\n or it turns out, or a human will advance in the face of fear or will pause or will retreat.\n\n19:02.880 --> 19:08.080\n Now that just assigns a neural structure to a behavioral phenomenon. But what's interesting\n\n19:08.080 --> 19:14.480\n is that it turns out that the lowest level of stress or autonomic arousal is actually associated\n\n19:14.480 --> 19:21.040\n with the pausing and freezing response. Then as the threat becomes more impending, and we used\n\n19:21.040 --> 19:28.000\n visual looms in this case, the retreat response has a slightly higher level of autonomic arousal\n\n19:28.000 --> 19:33.520\n and stress. So think about playing hide and go seeking, you're trying to stay quiet in a closet\n\n19:33.520 --> 19:38.400\n that you're hiding. If you're very calm, it's easy to stay quiet and still. As your level of stress\n\n19:38.400 --> 19:45.040\n goes up, it's harder to maintain that level of quiet and stillness. You see this also in animals\n\n19:45.040 --> 19:49.680\n that are stalking, a cat will chatter its teeth. That's actually sort of top down inhibition and\n\n19:49.680 --> 19:54.800\n trying to restrain behavior. So the freeze response is actually an active response,\n\n19:54.800 --> 19:59.440\n but it's fairly low stress. And what was interesting to us is that the highest level\n\n19:59.440 --> 20:05.280\n of autonomic arousal was associated with the forward movement toward the threat. So in your case,\n\n20:05.280 --> 20:13.520\n jumping out of the plane. However, the forward movement in the face of threat was linked to the\n\n20:13.520 --> 20:18.080\n activation of what we call collateral, which means just a side connection, literally a wire in the\n\n20:18.080 --> 20:25.360\n brain that connects to the dopamine circuits for reward. And so when one safely and adaptively,\n\n20:25.360 --> 20:31.360\n meaning you survive, moves through a threat or toward a threat, it's rewarded as a positive\n\n20:31.360 --> 20:36.880\n experience. And so the key, it actually maps very well to cognitive behavioral therapy and\n\n20:36.880 --> 20:42.640\n a lot of the existing treatments for trauma is that you have to confront the thing that\n\n20:42.640 --> 20:48.960\n makes you afraid. So otherwise you exist in this very low level of reverberatory circuit activity\n\n20:48.960 --> 20:53.760\n where the circuits for autonomic arousal are humming and they're humming more and more and\n\n20:53.760 --> 20:58.640\n more. And we have to remember that stress and fear and threat were designed to agitate us so\n\n20:58.640 --> 21:03.840\n that we actually move. So the reason I mentioned this is I think a lot of times people think that\n\n21:04.480 --> 21:10.880\n the maximum stress response or fear response is to freeze and to lock up. But that's actually not\n\n21:10.880 --> 21:16.720\n the maximum stress response. The maximum stress response is to advance, but it's associated with\n\n21:16.720 --> 21:22.080\n reward. It has positive valence. So there's this kind of, everyone always thinks about the bell\n\n21:22.080 --> 21:28.160\n shape, you know, the sort of hump shape curve for, you know, at low levels arousal performance is low\n\n21:28.160 --> 21:31.680\n and as the increases performance goes higher and then it drops off as you get really stressed.\n\n21:31.680 --> 21:36.960\n But there's another bump further out that distribution where you perform very well under\n\n21:36.960 --> 21:41.120\n very high levels of stress. And so we've been spending a lot of time in humans and in animals\n\n21:41.120 --> 21:48.800\n exploring what it takes to get people comfortable to go to that place and also to let them experience\n\n21:48.800 --> 21:54.080\n how there are heightened states of cognition there. There's changes in time perception that\n\n21:54.080 --> 22:01.040\n allow you to evaluate your environment at a faster frame rate, essentially. This is the matrix as a\n\n22:01.040 --> 22:06.240\n lot of people think of it. But we tend to think about fear as all the low level stuff where\n\n22:06.240 --> 22:13.840\n things aren't worked out, but there are a lot of different features to the fear response.\n\n22:13.840 --> 22:18.080\n And so we think about it quantitatively and we think about it from a circuit perspective\n\n22:18.080 --> 22:22.960\n in terms of outcomes. And we try and weigh that against the threat. So we never want people to\n\n22:22.960 --> 22:27.360\n put themselves in unnecessary risk, but that's where the VR is fun because you can push people\n\n22:27.360 --> 22:33.520\n hard without risk of physically injuring them. And that's like you said, the little bump that\n\n22:33.520 --> 22:38.240\n seems to be a very small fraction of the human experience, right? So it's kind of fascinating\n\n22:38.240 --> 22:48.160\n to study it because most of us move through life without ever experiencing that kind of focus.\n\n22:48.160 --> 22:52.720\n Well, everything's in a peak state there. I really think that's where optimal performance lies.\n\n22:53.280 --> 22:59.440\n There's so many interesting words here, but what's performance? And what's optimal performance?\n\n22:59.440 --> 23:07.280\n We're talking about mental ability to what to perceive the environment quickly to make actions\n\n23:07.280 --> 23:11.360\n quickly. What's optimal performance? Yeah. Well, it's very subjective and it\n\n23:11.360 --> 23:17.040\n varies depending on task and environment. So one way we can make it a little bit more\n\n23:17.040 --> 23:25.520\n operational and concrete is to say there is a sweet spot, if you will, where the level of internal\n\n23:25.520 --> 23:34.000\n autonomic arousal, AKA stress or alertness, whatever you want to call it, is ideally matched to the\n\n23:34.000 --> 23:39.200\n speed of whatever challenge you have to be facing in the outside world. So we all have\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:44.000\n perception of the outside world as exteroception and the perception of our internal real estate\n\n23:44.000 --> 23:49.200\n interoception. And when those two things, when interoception and exteroception are matched along\n\n23:49.200 --> 23:58.000\n a couple of dimensions, performance tends to increase or tends to be in an optimal range.\n\n23:58.000 --> 24:01.760\n So for instance, if you're, I don't play guitar, but I know you play guitar. So let's say you're\n\n24:01.760 --> 24:06.880\n trying to learn something new on the guitar. I'm not saying that being in these super high\n\n24:06.880 --> 24:13.200\n states of activation are the best place for you to be in order to learn. It may be that your\n\n24:13.200 --> 24:20.080\n internal arousal needs to be at a level where your analysis of space and time has to be well matched\n\n24:20.080 --> 24:25.760\n to the information coming in and what you're trying to do in terms of performance, in terms of\n\n24:25.760 --> 24:31.120\n playing chords and notes and so forth. Now, in these cases of high threat where things are coming\n\n24:31.120 --> 24:36.640\n in quickly and animals and humans need to react very quickly, the higher your state of autonomic\n\n24:36.640 --> 24:42.560\n arousal, the better because you're slicing time more finely just because of the way the autonomic\n\n24:42.560 --> 24:49.600\n system works. The pupil dilation, for instance, and movement of the lens essentially changes your\n\n24:49.600 --> 24:55.360\n optics and that's obvious. But with the change in optics is a change in how you bin time and\n\n24:55.360 --> 25:00.960\n slice time, which allows you to get more frames per second readout. With the guitar learning, for\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:09.120\n instance, it might actually be that you want to be almost sleepy, almost in a drowsy state to be able\n\n25:09.120 --> 25:14.400\n to, and I don't play music, so I'm guessing here, but sense some of the nuance in the chords or the\n\n25:14.400 --> 25:19.520\n ways to be relaxed enough that your fingers can follow an external cue. So matching the movement\n\n25:19.520 --> 25:25.680\n of your fingers to something that's pure exteroception. And so there is no perfect\n\n25:25.680 --> 25:33.600\n autonomic state for performance. This is why I don't favor terms like flow because they're not\n\n25:34.160 --> 25:41.120\n well operationally defined enough. But I do believe that optimal or peak performance is\n\n25:41.120 --> 25:48.560\n going to arise when internal state is ideally matched to the space time features of the external\n\n25:48.560 --> 25:54.880\n demands. So there's some slicing of time that happens and then you're able to adjust, slice\n\n25:54.880 --> 26:01.920\n time more finely or more, less finely in order to adjust to the stimulus, the dynamics of the\n\n26:01.920 --> 26:10.560\n stimulus. What about the realm of ideas? So like, you know, I'm a big believer, this guy named\n\n26:10.560 --> 26:18.640\n Cal Newport who wrote a book about deep work. Yeah, I love that book. Yeah, he's great. I mean,\n\n26:18.640 --> 26:24.240\n one of the nice things, I've always practiced deep work, but it's always nice to have words\n\n26:25.920 --> 26:31.360\n put to the concepts that you've practiced. It somehow makes them more concrete and allows you\n\n26:32.480 --> 26:38.320\n to get better. It turns it into a skill that you can get better at. But, you know, I also value\n\n26:38.320 --> 26:45.840\n deep thinking where you think it's almost meditative. You think about a particular\n\n26:45.840 --> 26:50.640\n concept for long periods of time. The programming you have to do that kind of thing for. You just\n\n26:50.640 --> 26:56.880\n have to hold this concept, like you hold it and then you take steps with it. You take further\n\n26:56.880 --> 27:03.040\n steps and you're holding relatively complicated things in your mind as you're thinking about them.\n\n27:03.040 --> 27:10.240\n And there's a lot of, I mean, the hardest part is there's frustrating things like you take a step\n\n27:10.240 --> 27:14.960\n and it turns out to be the wrong direction. So you have to calmly turn around and take a step back.\n\n27:14.960 --> 27:19.360\n And then it's, you kind of like exploring through the space of ideas. Is there something about\n\n27:20.000 --> 27:26.640\n your study of optimal performance that can be applied to the act of thinking as opposed to\n\n27:26.640 --> 27:33.840\n action? Well, we haven't done too much work there, but I think I can comment on it from a neuroscience\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:38.720\n perspective, which is really all I do is, well, I mean, we do experiments in the lab, but I'm\n\n27:38.720 --> 27:44.400\n looking at things through the lens of neuroscience. So what you're describing can be mapped fairly\n\n27:44.400 --> 27:51.440\n well to working memory, just keeping things online and updating them as they change in information\n\n27:51.440 --> 27:58.880\n is coming back into your brain. Jack Feldman, who I'm a huge fan of and fortunate to be friends\n\n27:58.880 --> 28:04.400\n with is a professor at UCLA, works on respiration and breathing, but he has a physics background.\n\n28:05.600 --> 28:10.560\n And so he thinks about respiration and breathing in terms of ground states and how they modulate\n\n28:10.560 --> 28:17.600\n other states. Very, very interesting and I think important work. Jack has an answer to your\n\n28:17.600 --> 28:21.440\n question. So I'm not going to get this exactly right because this is lifted from a coffee\n\n28:21.440 --> 28:28.560\n conversation that we had about a month ago. So apologies in advance, but I think I can get mostly\n\n28:28.560 --> 28:34.880\n right. So we were talking about this, about how the brain updates cognitive states depending on\n\n28:34.880 --> 28:40.160\n demands and thinking in particular. And he used an interesting example. I'd be curious to know if you\n\n28:40.160 --> 28:48.720\n agree or disagree. He said, most great mathematics is done by people in their late teens and 20s,\n\n28:49.280 --> 28:54.880\n and even you could say early 20s, sometimes into the late 20s, but not much further on. Maybe I\n\n28:54.880 --> 29:00.560\n just insulted some mathematicians. No, that's true. And I think that it demands, his argument\n\n29:00.560 --> 29:07.280\n was there's a tremendous demand on working memory to work out theorems in math and to keep a number\n\n29:07.280 --> 29:11.200\n of plates spinning, so to speak mentally and run back and forth between them, updating them.\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:20.400\n In physics, Jack said, and I think this makes sense to me too, that there's a reliance on\n\n29:20.400 --> 29:27.840\n working memory, but an increased reliance on some deep memory and deep memory stores,\n\n29:27.840 --> 29:34.720\n probably stuff that's moved out of the hippocampus and forebrain and into the cortex and is some\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:39.200\n episodic and declarative stuff, but really, so you're pulling from your library, basically. It's\n\n29:39.200 --> 29:44.640\n not all RAM, it's not all working memory. And then in biology, and physicists tend to have\n\n29:44.640 --> 29:50.880\n very active careers into their 30s and 40s and 50s and so forth, sometimes later. And then in\n\n29:50.880 --> 29:57.840\n biology, you see careers that have a much longer arc, these protracted careers often, people still\n\n29:57.840 --> 30:03.680\n in their 60s and 70s doing really terrific work, not always doing it with their own hands because\n\n30:03.680 --> 30:10.080\n people in the labs are doing them, of course. And that work does tend to rely on insights\n\n30:10.080 --> 30:16.720\n gained from having a very deep knowledge base where you can remember a paper or maybe a figure\n\n30:16.720 --> 30:20.720\n in a paper, you could go look it up if you wanted to, but it's very different than the working\n\n30:20.720 --> 30:27.360\n memory of the mathematician. And so when you're talking about coding or being in that tunnel of\n\n30:27.360 --> 30:34.320\n thought and trying to iterate and keeping a lot of plates spinning, it speaks directly to working\n\n30:34.320 --> 30:40.800\n memory. My lab hasn't done too much of that. But we are pushing working memory when we have people\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:47.440\n do things like these simple lights out tasks. We can increase the cognitive load by increasing the\n\n30:47.440 --> 30:54.000\n level of autonomic arousal to the point where they start doing less well. And everyone has a cliff.\n\n30:54.000 --> 30:58.160\n This is what's kind of fun. We've had SEAL team operators come to the lab. We've had people from\n\n30:58.160 --> 31:05.360\n other units in the military. We've had a range of intellects and backgrounds and all sorts of things\n\n31:05.360 --> 31:12.160\n and everyone has a cliff. And those cliffs sometimes show up as a function of the demands of\n\n31:12.160 --> 31:18.480\n speed of processing or how many things you need to keep online. I mean, we're all limited at some\n\n31:18.480 --> 31:21.760\n point in the number of things we can keep online. So what you're describing is very interesting\n\n31:21.760 --> 31:29.600\n because I think it has to do with how narrow or broad the information set is. And I'm not an\n\n31:29.600 --> 31:34.160\n active programmer, so this is a regime I don't really fully know. So I don't want to comment\n\n31:34.160 --> 31:41.920\n about it in any way that doesn't suggest that. But I think that what you're talking about is\n\n31:41.920 --> 31:48.960\n top down control. So this is prefrontal cortex keeping every bit of reflexive circuitry at bay,\n\n31:48.960 --> 31:51.840\n the one that makes you want to get up and use the restroom, the one that makes you want to check\n\n31:51.840 --> 31:59.040\n your phone, all of that, but also running these anterior thalamus to prefrontal cortex loops,\n\n31:59.040 --> 32:04.240\n which we know are very important for working memory. Let me try to think through this a little\n\n32:04.240 --> 32:14.640\n bit. So reducing the process of thinking to working memory access is tricky. It's probably\n\n32:14.640 --> 32:23.440\n ultimately correct. But if I were to say some of the most challenging things that an engineer has\n\n32:23.440 --> 32:29.120\n to do, and a scientific thinker, I would say it's kind of depressing to think that we do that best\n\n32:29.120 --> 32:39.600\n in our 20s, but is this kind of first principles thinking step of saying you're accessing the\n\n32:39.600 --> 32:47.680\n things that you know, and then saying, well, let me, how do I do this differently than I've done\n\n32:47.680 --> 32:57.600\n it before? This weird like stepping back, like, is this right? Let's try it this other way. That's\n\n32:57.600 --> 33:05.760\n the most mentally taxing step is like, you've gotten quite good at this particular pattern of\n\n33:05.760 --> 33:11.520\n how you solve this particular problem. So there's a pattern recognition first. You're like, okay,\n\n33:11.520 --> 33:16.480\n I know how to build a thing that solves this particular problem in programming, say. And then\n\n33:18.400 --> 33:25.840\n the question is, but can I do it much better? And I don't know if that's, I don't know what\n\n33:25.840 --> 33:32.480\n the hell that is. I don't know if that's accessing working memory. That's almost access. Maybe it is\n\n33:32.480 --> 33:37.840\n accessing memory in a sense. It's trying to find similar patterns in a totally different place that\n\n33:37.840 --> 33:47.520\n it could be projected onto this. But you're not querying facts. You're querying like functional\n\n33:47.520 --> 33:52.320\n things like. Yeah, it's patterns. I mean, you're running out, you're testing algorithms. Yeah.\n\n33:52.320 --> 33:59.200\n Right. You're testing algorithms. So I want to just, because I know some of the people listening\n\n33:59.200 --> 34:04.560\n to this and you have a basis in scientific training and have scientific training. So I\n\n34:04.560 --> 34:09.440\n want to be clear. I think we can be correct about some things like the role of working memory in\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:14.160\n these kinds of processes without being exhaustive. We're not saying they're the only thing. We can be\n\n34:14.160 --> 34:20.000\n correct, but not assume that that's the only thing involved. And neuroscience, let's face it,\n\n34:20.000 --> 34:24.080\n is still in its infancy. I mean, we probably know 1% of what there is to know about the brain.\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:29.920\n I mean, we've learned so much and yet there may be global states that underlie this that\n\n34:30.480 --> 34:37.040\n make prefrontal circuitry work differently than it would in a different regime or even time of day.\n\n34:37.040 --> 34:44.160\n I mean, there's a lot of mysteries about this. So I just want to make sure that we're aiming for\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:49.440\n precision and accuracy, but we're not going to be exhausted. So there's a difference there. And I\n\n34:49.440 --> 34:57.360\n think sometimes in the vastness of the internet, that gets forgotten. So the other is that\n\n35:02.800 --> 35:09.040\n we think about these operations at really focused, keeping a lot of things online.\n\n35:09.040 --> 35:16.400\n But what you were describing is actually, it speaks to the very real possibility probably\n\n35:16.400 --> 35:22.000\n that with certainty, there's another element to all this, which is when you're trying out lots\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:27.680\n of things, in particular, lots of different algorithms, you don't want to be in a state of\n\n35:27.680 --> 35:32.080\n very high autonomic arousal. That's not what you want, because the higher level of autonomic\n\n35:32.080 --> 35:38.080\n arousal and stress in the system, the more rigidly you're going to analyze space and time. And what\n\n35:38.080 --> 35:43.200\n you're talking about is playing with space time dimensionality. And I want to be very clear. I'm\n\n35:43.200 --> 35:47.360\n the son of a physicist. I am not a physicist. When I talk about space and time, I'm literally\n\n35:47.360 --> 35:53.040\n talking about visual space and how long it takes for my finger to move from this point to this\n\n35:53.040 --> 35:58.000\n point. You are facing a tiger and trying to figure out how to avoid being eaten by the tiger.\n\n35:58.000 --> 36:02.720\n And that's primarily going to be determined by the visual system in humans. We don't walk through\n\n36:02.720 --> 36:09.040\n space, for instance, like a cent hound would and look at three dimensional scent plumes. When a\n\n36:09.040 --> 36:15.280\n scent hound goes out in the environment, they have depth to the odor trails they're following.\n\n36:15.280 --> 36:19.280\n And they don't think about them. We don't think about odor trails. You might say,\n\n36:19.280 --> 36:24.000\n oh, well, the smell's getting more intense. Aha. But they actually have three dimensional odor\n\n36:24.000 --> 36:29.520\n trails. So they see a cone of odor, see, of course, with their nose, with their olfactory cortex.\n\n36:29.520 --> 36:35.920\n We do that with our visual system. And we parse time, often subconsciously, mainly with our visual\n\n36:35.920 --> 36:40.160\n system, also with our auditory system. And this shows up for the musicians out there. Metronomes\n\n36:40.160 --> 36:44.960\n are a great way to play with this. Bass drumming, when the frequency of bass drumming changes,\n\n36:44.960 --> 36:50.240\n your perception of time changes quite a lot. So in any event, space and time are linked\n\n36:50.240 --> 36:55.280\n through the sensory apparatus, through the eyes and ears and nose, and probably through taste too,\n\n36:55.280 --> 37:02.960\n and through touch for us, but mainly through vision. So when you drop into some coding or\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:07.440\n iterating through a creative process or trying to solve something hard,\n\n37:08.960 --> 37:15.280\n you can't really do that well if you're in a rigid, high level of autonomic arousal because\n\n37:15.280 --> 37:20.880\n you're plugging in algorithms that are in this space regime, this time regime matches. It's\n\n37:20.880 --> 37:25.360\n space time matched. Whereas creativity, I always think the lava lamp is actually a pretty good\n\n37:25.360 --> 37:29.760\n example, even though it has these counterculture, new agey connotations, because you actually don't\n\n37:29.760 --> 37:36.320\n know which direction things are going to change. And so in drowsy states, sleeping and drowsy\n\n37:36.320 --> 37:41.040\n states, space and time become dislodged from one another somewhat, and they're very fluid.\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:47.440\n And I think that's why a lot of solutions come to people after sleep and naps. And this could\n\n37:47.440 --> 37:52.080\n even take us into a discussion, if you like, about psychedelics and what we now know, for instance,\n\n37:53.040 --> 37:58.240\n that people thought that psychedelics work by just creating spontaneous bursting of neurons\n\n37:58.240 --> 38:06.640\n and hallucinations. But the 5H2C and 2A receptors, which are the main sites for things like LSD and\n\n38:06.640 --> 38:12.640\n psilocybin and some of the other ones that create hallucinations, the drugs that create hallucinations,\n\n38:13.600 --> 38:20.560\n most of those receptors are actually in the collection of neurons that encase the thalamus,\n\n38:20.560 --> 38:24.320\n which is where all the sensory information goes into, a structure called the thalamic\n\n38:24.320 --> 38:31.120\n reticular nucleus. And it's an inhibitory structure that makes sure that when we're\n\n38:31.120 --> 38:36.880\n sitting here talking, that I'm mainly focused on whatever I'm seeing visually, that I'm essentially\n\n38:36.880 --> 38:41.600\n eliminating a lot of sensory information. Under conditions where people take psychedelics and\n\n38:41.600 --> 38:48.240\n these particular serotonin receptors are activated, that inhibitory shell, it's literally shaped like\n\n38:48.240 --> 38:54.880\n a shell, starts losing its ability to inhibit the passage of sensory information. But mostly\n\n38:55.440 --> 39:00.800\n the effects of psychedelics are because the lateral connectivity in layer five of cortex\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:08.480\n across cortical areas is increased. And what that does is that means that the space time relationship\n\n39:08.480 --> 39:12.240\n for vision, like moving my finger from here to here, very rigid space time relationship,\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:15.840\n right? If I slow it down, it's slower, obviously, but there's a prediction that can be made based on\n\n39:15.840 --> 39:19.520\n the neurons in the retina and the cortex. On psychedelics, this could be a very strange\n\n39:19.520 --> 39:25.920\n experience. But the auditory system has one that's slightly different space time, and they're matched\n\n39:25.920 --> 39:29.920\n to one another in deeper circuits in the brain. The olfactory system has a different space time\n\n39:29.920 --> 39:38.640\n relationship to it. So under conditions of these increased activation of these serotonin receptors,\n\n39:38.640 --> 39:44.720\n space and time across sensory area starts being fluid. So I'm no longer running the algorithm for\n\n39:44.720 --> 39:49.920\n moving my finger from here to here and making a prediction based on vision alone. I'm now,\n\n39:49.920 --> 39:57.280\n this is where people talk about hearing sites, right? You start linking, this might actually\n\n39:57.280 --> 40:01.120\n make a sound in a psychedelic state. Now I'm not suggesting people run out and do psychedelics\n\n40:01.120 --> 40:05.600\n because it's very disorganized, but essentially what you're doing is you're mixing the algorithms.\n\n40:05.600 --> 40:10.000\n And so when you talk about being able to access new solutions, you don't need to rely on\n\n40:10.000 --> 40:15.920\n psychedelics. If people choose to do that, that's their business. But in drowsy states, this lateral\n\n40:15.920 --> 40:21.440\n connectivity is increased as well. The shell of the thalamus shuts down. And these are through\n\n40:21.440 --> 40:25.920\n these so called pons chiniculate occipital waves. And what's happening is you're getting whole brain\n\n40:25.920 --> 40:32.160\n activation at a level that you start mixing algorithms. And so sometimes I think solutions\n\n40:32.160 --> 40:38.720\n come not from being in that narrow tunnel of space time and strong activation of working memory and\n\n40:38.720 --> 40:43.920\n trying to well iterate if this, then this very strong, deductive and inductive thinking and\n\n40:43.920 --> 40:49.920\n working from first principles, but also from states where something that was an algorithm\n\n40:49.920 --> 40:55.680\n that you never had in existence before suddenly gets lumped with another algorithm. And all of a\n\n40:55.680 --> 41:03.280\n sudden a new possibility comes to mind. And so space and time need to be fluid and space and\n\n41:03.280 --> 41:08.160\n time need to be rigid in order to come up with something meaningful. And I realize I'm riffing\n\n41:08.160 --> 41:11.760\n long on this, but this is why I think, you know, there was so much interest a few years ago with\n\n41:11.760 --> 41:17.760\n Michael Pollan's book and other things happening about psychedelics as a pathway to exploration and\n\n41:17.760 --> 41:21.920\n all this kind of thing. But the real question is what you export back from those experiences,\n\n41:21.920 --> 41:26.640\n because dreams are amazing, but if you can't bring anything back from them, they're just amazing.\n\n41:27.200 --> 41:34.400\n I wonder how to experiment with the mind without, without any medical assistance\n\n41:34.400 --> 41:39.760\n first. Like, you know, I, I pushed my mind in all kinds of directions. I definitely want to,\n\n41:39.760 --> 41:47.520\n I did, uh, shrooms a couple of times. I definitely want to, uh, figure out how I can experiment with,\n\n41:47.520 --> 41:57.040\n um, with psychedelics. I'm talking to, uh, Rick Doblin, uh, soon. I even went back and forth. So\n\n41:57.040 --> 42:02.240\n he does all these studies on psychedelics and he keeps ignoring the parts of my email that asks,\n\n42:02.240 --> 42:06.160\n like, how do I participate in these studies? Well, there are some legality issues. I mean,\n\n42:06.160 --> 42:09.920\n conversation, I want to be very clear. I'm not saying that anyone should go out and do psychedelics.\n\n42:09.920 --> 42:14.800\n I think that drowsy states and sleep states are super interesting for accessing some of\n\n42:14.800 --> 42:19.200\n these more creative states of mind. Hypnosis is something that my colleague, David Spiegel,\n\n42:19.200 --> 42:24.000\n associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford works on where also, again, it's a unique state because\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:29.840\n you have narrow context. So this is very, um, kind of tunnel vision and yet deeply relaxed,\n\n42:29.840 --> 42:36.080\n excuse me, deeply relaxed where new algorithms, if you will, can start to surface, um, strong\n\n42:36.080 --> 42:43.040\n state for inducing neuroplasticity. And I think, you know, so if I had a, um, I'm part of a group,\n\n42:43.040 --> 42:47.840\n um, that, uh, it's called the liminal collective as a group of people that get together and talk\n\n42:47.840 --> 42:53.680\n about, um, just wild ideas, but they try and implement. Um, and it's a, it's a really interesting\n\n42:53.680 --> 42:58.800\n group. Some people from a military, from a logitech and some other backgrounds, academic\n\n42:58.800 --> 43:03.280\n backgrounds. And I was asked, you know, what would be, um, if you could create a tool,\n\n43:03.280 --> 43:07.520\n you just had a tool like your magic wand wish for the day, what would it be? I thought it'd\n\n43:07.520 --> 43:14.080\n be really interesting if someone could develop psychedelics that have, um, on off switches.\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:22.160\n So you could go into a psychedelic state very deeply for 10 minutes, but you could launch\n\n43:22.160 --> 43:27.040\n yourself out of that state and place yourself into a linear real world state very quickly\n\n43:27.040 --> 43:30.960\n so that you could extract whatever it was that happened in that experience. And then go back\n\n43:30.960 --> 43:37.120\n in if you wanted, because the problem with psychedelic states and dream states is that\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:42.080\n first of all, a lot of the reason people do them is they're lying. They say they want plasticity\n\n43:42.080 --> 43:47.760\n and they want all this stuff. They want a peak experience inside of an amplified experience.\n\n43:47.760 --> 43:51.680\n So they're kind of seeking something unusual. And I think we should just be honest about that\n\n43:51.680 --> 43:54.400\n because a lot of times they're not trying to make their brain better. They're just trying\n\n43:54.400 --> 44:01.360\n to experience something really amazing. But the problem is space and time are so unlocked\n\n44:01.920 --> 44:06.400\n in these states, just like they are in dreams, that you can really end up with a whole lot of\n\n44:06.400 --> 44:12.320\n nothing. You can have an amazing amplified experience housed in an amplified experience\n\n44:12.320 --> 44:18.640\n and come out of that thinking you had a meaningful experience when you didn't bring anything back.\n\n44:18.640 --> 44:24.560\n You didn't bring anything back. All you have is a fuzzy memory of having a transformational\n\n44:24.560 --> 44:32.080\n experience, but you don't actually have tools to bring back, sorry, actually concrete ideas to\n\n44:32.080 --> 44:38.960\n bring back. Yeah, it's interesting. I wonder if it's possible to do that with a mind to be able to\n\n44:38.960 --> 44:45.440\n hop back and forth. I think that's where the real power of adjusting states is going to be. It\n\n44:45.440 --> 44:50.000\n probably will be with devices. I mean, maybe it will be done through pharmacology. It's just that\n\n44:50.000 --> 44:54.320\n it's hard to do on off switches in human pharmacology that we have them for animals.\n\n44:54.320 --> 45:01.360\n I mean, we have Cree flip recombinases and we have channel opsins and halo root opsins and\n\n45:02.080 --> 45:07.200\n all these kinds of things. But to do that work in humans is tricky, but I think you could do it\n\n45:07.200 --> 45:12.880\n with virtual reality, augmented reality and other devices that bring more of the somatic experience\n\n45:12.880 --> 45:19.440\n into it. You're of course, a scientist who's studying humans as a collective. I tend to be\n\n45:19.440 --> 45:27.120\n just a one person scientist of just looking at myself and I play when these deep thinking,\n\n45:27.120 --> 45:34.880\n deep work sessions, I'm very cognizant in the morning that there's times when my mind is so\n\n45:34.880 --> 45:43.440\n eloquent at being able to jump around from ideas and hold them all together. I'm almost like I\n\n45:43.440 --> 45:49.600\n step back from a third person perspective and enjoy that, whatever that mind is doing,\n\n45:49.600 --> 45:59.280\n I do not waste those moments. I'm very conscious of this little creature that woke up that's only\n\n45:59.280 --> 46:04.960\n awake for, if we're being honest, maybe a couple hours a day. Early part of the day for you.\n\n46:04.960 --> 46:10.480\n Early part of the day. Not always. Well, early part of the day for me is a very fluid concept.\n\n46:11.520 --> 46:12.320\n You're one of those.\n\n46:12.320 --> 46:12.800\n Yeah, I'm one.\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:13.680\n Yeah, you're one of those.\n\n46:13.680 --> 46:18.960\n Being single, one of the problems, single and no meetings. I don't schedule any meetings.\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:28.720\n I've been living at like a 28 hour day. So it drifts. So it's all over the place. But\n\n46:28.720 --> 46:38.000\n after a traditionally defined full night's sleep, whatever the heck that means, I find that in those\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:44.960\n moments, there's a clarity of mind that's just, everything is effortless. And it's the deepest\n\n46:44.960 --> 46:52.720\n dives intellectually that I make. And I'm cognizant of it. And I try to bring that to the other parts\n\n46:52.720 --> 46:57.840\n of the day that don't have it and treasure them even more in those moments because they only last\n\n46:57.840 --> 47:02.640\n like five or 10 minutes. Because of course, in those moments you want to do all kinds of stupid\n\n47:02.640 --> 47:07.360\n stuff that are completely is worthless, like check social media or something like that.\n\n47:07.360 --> 47:15.040\n But those are the most precious things in intellectual life is those mental moments\n\n47:15.040 --> 47:21.360\n of clarity. And I wonder, I'm learning how to control them. I think caffeine is somehow involved.\n\n47:21.360 --> 47:22.160\n I'm not sure exactly.\n\n47:22.160 --> 47:25.120\n Sure. Well, because if you learn how to titrate caffeine,\n\n47:25.120 --> 47:29.440\n and everyone's slightly different with this, what they need, but if you learn to titrate caffeine\n\n47:29.440 --> 47:33.440\n with time of day and the kind of work that you're trying to do, you can bring that autonomic arousal\n\n47:33.440 --> 47:39.360\n state into a close to perfect place. And then you can tune it in with, sometimes people want a little\n\n47:39.360 --> 47:43.840\n bit of background music. Sometimes they want less, these kinds of things. The early part of the day\n\n47:43.840 --> 47:48.080\n is interesting because the one thing that's not often discussed is this transition out of sleep.\n\n47:48.800 --> 47:53.680\n So there's a book, I think it's called Winston Churchill's Nap. And it's about\n\n47:53.680 --> 48:00.800\n naps and the transition between wake and sleep as a valuable period. A long time ago,\n\n48:02.320 --> 48:08.720\n someone who I respect a lot was mentoring me said, be very careful about bringing in\n\n48:08.720 --> 48:14.800\n someone else's sensory experience early in the day. So when I wake up, I'm very drowsy. I sleep\n\n48:14.800 --> 48:20.400\n well, but I don't emerge from that very quickly. I need a lot of caffeine to wake up and whatnot.\n\n48:20.400 --> 48:28.080\n But there's this concept of getting the download from sleep, which is in sleep, you were essentially\n\n48:28.080 --> 48:32.240\n expunging the things that you don't need, the stuff that is meaningless from the previous day,\n\n48:32.960 --> 48:36.880\n but you were also running variations on these algorithms of whatever it is you're trying to\n\n48:36.880 --> 48:41.520\n work out in life on short timescales like the previous day and long timescales like your whole\n\n48:41.520 --> 48:51.040\n life. And those lateral connections in layer five of the neocortex are very robustly active and\n\n48:51.040 --> 48:56.320\n across sensory areas. And you're running an algorithm or it's a brain state that will be\n\n48:56.320 --> 49:00.320\n useless in waking. You wouldn't get anything done. You'd be the person talking to yourself\n\n49:00.320 --> 49:04.320\n in the hallway or something about something that no one else can see. But in those states,\n\n49:06.400 --> 49:10.640\n the theory is that you arrive at certain solutions and those solutions will reveal\n\n49:10.640 --> 49:16.160\n themselves in the early part of the day, unless you interfere with them by bringing in,\n\n49:16.160 --> 49:19.200\n social media is a good example of you immediately enter somebody else's\n\n49:20.400 --> 49:25.200\n space time sensory relationship. Someone is the conductor of your thoughts in that case.\n\n49:25.200 --> 49:30.720\n And so many people have written about this. What I'm saying isn't entirely new, but allowing the\n\n49:30.720 --> 49:38.240\n download to occur in the early part of the day and asking the question, am I more in my head\n\n49:38.240 --> 49:43.600\n or am I more of an interoceptive or exteroceptive mode? And depending on the kind of work you need\n\n49:43.600 --> 49:50.000\n to do, if it sounds like for you, it's very interoceptive and you've got a lot of thinking\n\n49:50.000 --> 49:54.880\n going on and a lot of computing going on, allowing yourself to transition out of that sleep state and\n\n49:54.880 --> 50:01.520\n arrive with those solutions from sleep and plug into the work really deeply. And only then allowing\n\n50:01.520 --> 50:06.240\n things like music, news, social media, doesn't mean you shouldn't talk to loved ones and see\n\n50:06.240 --> 50:09.840\n faces and things like that. But some people have taken this to the extreme. When I was a graduate\n\n50:09.840 --> 50:15.840\n student at Berkeley, there was a guy there, a professor, brilliant, odd, but brilliant,\n\n50:16.960 --> 50:21.920\n who was so fixated on this concept that he wouldn't look at faces in the early part of the\n\n50:21.920 --> 50:29.920\n day because he just didn't want anything else to impact him. Now he didn't have the most rounded\n\n50:29.920 --> 50:35.200\n life, I suppose. But if you're talking about cognitive performance, this could actually be\n\n50:35.200 --> 50:41.840\n very beneficial. You said so many brilliant things. So one, if you read books that describe\n\n50:41.840 --> 50:51.200\n the habits of brilliant people like writers, they do control that sensory experience in the\n\n50:51.200 --> 50:58.000\n hours after wake. Like many writers, you know, they have a particular habit of several hours\n\n50:58.000 --> 51:02.320\n early in the morning of actual writing. They don't do anything else for the rest of the day,\n\n51:02.320 --> 51:07.200\n but they control, they're very sensitive to noises and so on. I think they make it very difficult to\n\n51:07.200 --> 51:16.000\n live with them. I try to, I'm definitely like that. Like I could, I love to control the sensory\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:20.560\n how much information is coming in. There's something about the peaceful, just everything\n\n51:20.560 --> 51:26.720\n being peaceful. At the same time, and we were talking to a mutual friend of Whitney Cummings,\n\n51:26.720 --> 51:34.240\n who has a mansion, a castle on top of a cliff in the middle of nowhere. She actually purchased her\n\n51:34.240 --> 51:41.680\n own island. She wants silence. She wants to control how much sound is coming in.\n\n51:41.680 --> 51:46.560\n She's very sensitive to sound and environment. Beautiful home and environment, but like clearly\n\n51:46.560 --> 51:51.920\n puts a lot of attention into details. Yeah. And very creative.\n\n51:51.920 --> 51:58.480\n Yeah. And that's, yeah, that allows for creativity to flourish. I'm also, I don't like that feels\n\n51:58.480 --> 52:07.360\n like a slippery slope. So I enjoy introducing the noises and signals and training my mind to\n\n52:07.360 --> 52:12.960\n be able to tune them out. Cause I feel like you can't always control the environment so perfectly\n\n52:12.960 --> 52:17.840\n because, cause your mind gets comfortable with that. I think it's a skill that you want to learn\n\n52:17.840 --> 52:23.200\n to be able to shut it off. Like I often go to like back before COVID to a coffee shop.\n\n52:23.840 --> 52:29.200\n It really annoys me when there's sounds and voices and so on, but I feel like I can train my mind\n\n52:29.200 --> 52:32.560\n to, to block them out. So it's, it's a balance, I think.\n\n52:32.560 --> 52:37.760\n Yeah. And I think you know, two things come to mind as you're saying this first of all,\n\n52:37.760 --> 52:42.960\n yeah. I mean, we're talking about what's best for work is not always what's best for, you know,\n\n52:42.960 --> 52:47.600\n completeness of life. I mean, you know, autism is probably many things like when you hit autism,\n\n52:47.600 --> 52:52.080\n just like feet, there are probably 50 ways to get a fever. There are probably 50 ways to,\n\n52:52.080 --> 52:55.760\n that the brain can create what looks like autism or what people call autism.\n\n52:55.760 --> 53:00.400\n There's an interesting set of studies that have come out of David Ginty's lab at Harvard med,\n\n53:02.240 --> 53:08.480\n looking at these are mouse mutants where these are models for autism, where nothing is disrupted\n\n53:09.040 --> 53:15.040\n in the brain proper and in the central nervous system, but the sensory app, the sensory neurons,\n\n53:15.040 --> 53:19.680\n the ones that innervate the skin and the ears and everything are, are hypersensitive. And this maps\n\n53:19.680 --> 53:27.840\n to a mutation in certain forms of human autism. So this means that the, the overload of sensory\n\n53:27.840 --> 53:31.680\n information and sensory experience that a lot of autistics feel, they're like that they can't\n\n53:31.680 --> 53:35.520\n tolerate things. And then they get the stereotype behaviors, the rocking and the kind of the\n\n53:35.520 --> 53:41.520\n shouting it, you know, we always thought of that as a brain problem. In some cases it might be,\n\n53:41.520 --> 53:46.640\n but in many cases it's because they just can't, they, they seem to have a, it's like turning the\n\n53:46.640 --> 53:51.040\n volume up on every sense. And so they're overwhelmed and none of us want to become like\n\n53:51.040 --> 53:55.360\n that. I think it's very hard for them and it's hard for their parents and so forth. So I, I like\n\n53:55.360 --> 54:02.960\n the coffee shop example because the way I think about trying to build up resilience, you know,\n\n54:02.960 --> 54:07.040\n physically or mentally or otherwise is one of I guess we could call it limb. I like to call it\n\n54:07.040 --> 54:10.880\n limbic friction. That's not a real scientific term. And I acknowledge that I'm making it up\n\n54:10.880 --> 54:14.880\n now because I think it captures the concept, which is that, you know, we always hear about\n\n54:14.880 --> 54:18.640\n resilience. It makes it sound like, oh, you know, under stress where everything's coming at you,\n\n54:18.640 --> 54:23.760\n you're going to stay calm, but there's another, you know, so limbic, the limbic system wants to\n\n54:23.760 --> 54:30.240\n pull you in some direction, typically in the direction of reflexive behavior and the prefrontal\n\n54:30.240 --> 54:35.920\n cortex through top down mechanisms has to suppress that and say, no, we're not going to respond to\n\n54:35.920 --> 54:41.040\n the banging of the coffee cups behind me, or I'm going to keep focusing. That's pure top down\n\n54:41.040 --> 54:45.920\n control. So limbic friction is high in that environment. You've put yourself into a high\n\n54:45.920 --> 54:49.600\n limbic friction environment, meaning that the prefrontal cortex has to work really hard.\n\n54:49.600 --> 54:53.600\n But there's another side to limbic friction too, which is when you're very sleepy,\n\n54:54.320 --> 54:59.440\n there's nothing incoming. It can be completely silent and it's hard to engage and focus because\n\n54:59.440 --> 55:03.120\n you're drifting off and you're getting sleepy. So their limbic friction is high, but for the\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:08.320\n opposite reason, autonomic arousal is too low. So they're turning on Netflix in the background or\n\n55:08.320 --> 55:15.280\n looping a song might boost your level of alertness that will allow top down control to be in exactly\n\n55:15.280 --> 55:21.200\n the sweet spot you want it. So this is why earlier I was saying it's all about how we feel inside\n\n55:21.200 --> 55:26.480\n relative to what's going on on the outside. We're constantly in this, I guess one way you\n\n55:26.480 --> 55:31.760\n could envision it spatially, especially if people are listening to this just on audio,\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:37.360\n is I like to think about it kind of like a glass barbell where one sphere of perception and\n\n55:37.360 --> 55:42.480\n attention can be on what's going on with me. And one sphere of attention can be on what's going on\n\n55:42.480 --> 55:48.000\n with you or something else in the room or in my environment. But this barbell isn't rigid. It's\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:53.920\n not really glass. Would plasma work here? I don't know anything about plasma. Sorry. I don't know.\n\n55:55.360 --> 56:00.320\n So imagine that this thing can contort the size of the globes at the end of this barbell can get\n\n56:00.320 --> 56:05.120\n bigger or smaller. So let's say I close my eyes and I bring all my experience into what's going on\n\n56:06.800 --> 56:12.240\n through interoception internally. Now it's as if I've got two orbs of perception just on my\n\n56:12.240 --> 56:17.040\n internal state, but I can also do the opposite and bring both orbs of perception outside me.\n\n56:17.040 --> 56:20.320\n I'm not thinking about my heart rate or my breathing. I'm just thinking about something\n\n56:20.320 --> 56:27.040\n I see. And what you'll start to realize as you kind of use this spatial model is that two things.\n\n56:27.040 --> 56:34.400\n One is that it's very dynamic and that the more relaxed we are, the more these two orbs of\n\n56:34.400 --> 56:40.320\n attention, the two ends of the barbell can move around freely. The more alert we are,\n\n56:40.320 --> 56:45.040\n the more rigid they're going to be tethered in place. And that was designed so that if I have\n\n56:45.040 --> 56:50.880\n a threat in my environment, it's tethered to that threat. If something's coming to attack me, I'm not\n\n56:50.880 --> 56:54.480\n going to be like, oh, my breathing cadence is a little bit quick. That's not how it works. Why?\n\n56:54.480 --> 57:01.680\n Because both orbs are linked to that threat. And so my behavior is now actually being driven by\n\n57:01.680 --> 57:05.600\n something external, even though I think it's internal. And so I don't want to get too abstract\n\n57:05.600 --> 57:10.720\n here because I'm a neuroscientist. I'm not a theorist. But when you start thinking about\n\n57:10.720 --> 57:15.360\n models of how the brain works, there are only really three things that neurons do. They're\n\n57:15.360 --> 57:22.720\n either sensory neurons, they're motor neurons, or they're modulating things. And the models of\n\n57:22.720 --> 57:28.720\n attention and perception that we have now, 2020, tell us that we've got interoception\n\n57:28.720 --> 57:33.440\n and exteroception. They're strongly modulated by levels of autonomic arousal. And that if we want\n\n57:33.440 --> 57:40.320\n to form the optimal relationship to some task or some pressure or some thing, whether or not it's\n\n57:40.320 --> 57:47.600\n sleep, an impending threat, or coding, we need to adjust our internal space time relationship with\n\n57:47.600 --> 57:51.520\n the external space time relationship. And I realize I'm repeating what I said earlier.\n\n57:51.520 --> 57:56.880\n But we can actually assign circuitry to this stuff. It mostly has to do with how much limbic\n\n57:56.880 --> 58:01.040\n friction there is, how much you're being pulled to some source. That source could be internal.\n\n58:01.680 --> 58:06.640\n If I have pain, physical pain in my body, I'm going to be much more interoceptive than I am\n\n58:06.640 --> 58:09.840\n exteroceptive. You could be talking to me and I'm just going to be thinking about that pain. It's\n\n58:09.840 --> 58:17.280\n very hard. And the other thing that we can link it to is top down control, meaning anything in\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:21.600\n our environment that has a lot of salience will tend to bring us into more exteroception than\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:26.240\n interoception. And again, I don't want to litter the conversation with just a bunch of terms, but\n\n58:26.880 --> 58:31.280\n what I think it can be useful for people is to do what essentially you've done,\n\n58:31.280 --> 58:37.200\n Lex, is to start developing an awareness. When I wake up, am I mostly in a mode of interoception\n\n58:37.200 --> 58:43.760\n or exteroception? When I work well, what does working well look like from the perspective of\n\n58:43.760 --> 58:49.520\n autonomic arousal? How alert or calm am I? What kind of balance between internal focus and external\n\n58:49.520 --> 58:54.800\n focus is there? And to sort of watch this process throughout the day. Can you linger just briefly\n\n58:54.800 --> 59:00.400\n on, because you use this term a lot and it'd be nice to try to get a little more color to it,\n\n59:00.400 --> 59:07.280\n which is interoception and exteroception. What are we exactly talking about? So like\n\n59:07.280 --> 59:14.560\n what's included in each category and how much overlap is there? Interoception would be an\n\n59:14.560 --> 59:20.320\n awareness of anything that's within the confines or on the surface of my skin that I'm sensing.\n\n59:20.320 --> 59:24.480\n So literally physiological. Physiologically, like within the boundaries of my skin\n\n59:24.480 --> 59:30.080\n and probably touched to the skin as well. Exteroception would be perception of anything\n\n59:30.080 --> 59:40.800\n that's beyond the reach of my skin. So that bottle of water, a scent, a sound, and this\n\n59:40.800 --> 59:44.320\n can change dramatically actually. If you have headphones in, you tend to hear things in your\n\n59:44.320 --> 59:48.800\n head as opposed to a speaker in the room. This is actually the basis of ventriloquism.\n\n59:49.440 --> 59:55.040\n So there are beautiful experiments done by Greg Reckenzone up at UC Davis, looking at how auditory\n\n59:55.040 --> 1:00:01.120\n and visual cues are matched and you have an array of speakers and this will become obvious as I say\n\n1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:06.080\n it, but obviously the ventriloquist doesn't throw their voice. What they do is they direct your\n\n1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:10.560\n vision to a particular location and you think the sound is coming from that location. And there are\n\n1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:13.840\n beautiful experiments that Greg and his colleagues have done where they suddenly introduce an\n\n1:00:13.840 --> 1:00:20.000\n auditory visual mismatch and it freaks people out because you can actually make it seem from a\n\n1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:26.560\n perception standpoint as if the sound arrived from the corner of the room and hit you physically and\n\n1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:31.840\n people will recoil. And so sounds aren't getting thrown across the room. They're still coming from\n\n1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:37.680\n a defined location, an array of speakers, but this is the way the brain creates these internal\n\n1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:46.800\n representations. And again, I don't want to go down a rabbit hole, but I'm sure the listeners\n\n1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:52.480\n appreciate this, but everything in the brain is an abstraction, right? I mean, the sensory\n\n1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:58.080\n apparatus, there are the eyes and ears and nose and skin and taste and all that are taking\n\n1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:03.040\n information and with interoception, taking information from sensors inside the body,\n\n1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:08.160\n the enteric nervous system for the gut. I've got sensory neurons that innervate my liver,\n\n1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:16.960\n um, et cetera, taking all that. And the brain is abstracting that in the same way that if I\n\n1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:21.120\n took a picture of your face and I handed it to you and I'd say, that's you, you'd say, yeah, that's\n\n1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:26.320\n me. But if I were an abstract artist, I'd be doing a little bit more of what the brain does, where if\n\n1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:30.480\n I took a pen, pad and paper, maybe I could do this because I'm a terrible artist and I could just\n\n1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:34.720\n mix it up. And I, let's say I would make your eyes like water bottles, but I'd flip them upside down\n\n1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:38.560\n and I'd start assigning fruits and objects to the different features of your face. And I show it to\n\n1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:42.240\n you, I say, Lex, that's you say, well, that's not me. And I'd say, no, but that's my abstraction\n\n1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:47.520\n of you. But that's what the brain does. The space time relationship of the neurons that fire that\n\n1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:53.520\n encode your face has have no resemblance to your face. Right. And I think people don't really,\n\n1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:58.400\n I don't know if people have fully internalized that, but the day that I, and I'm not sure I\n\n1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:04.320\n fully internalized that because it's weird to think about, but all neurons can do is fire in\n\n1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:08.640\n space and in time, different neurons in different sequences, perhaps with different intensities.\n\n1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:12.480\n It's not clear. The action potential is all or none. Although people, neuroscientists don't like\n\n1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:16.160\n to talk about that, even though it's been published in nature a couple of times, the\n\n1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:20.240\n action potential for a given neuron doesn't always have the exact same waveform. People,\n\n1:02:20.240 --> 1:02:23.440\n it's in all the textbooks, but you can modify that waveform.\n\n1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:29.680\n Well, I mean, there's a lot of fascinating stuff with neuroscience about the fuzziness of all the,\n\n1:02:29.680 --> 1:02:35.600\n of the transfer of information from neuron to neuron. I mean, we certainly touch upon it every\n\n1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:40.080\n time we at all try to think about the difference between artificial neural networks and biological\n\n1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:45.920\n neural networks. But can we maybe linger a little bit on this, on the circuitry that you're getting\n\n1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:53.120\n at? So the brain is just a bunch of stuff firing and it forms abstractions that are fascinating\n\n1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:58.480\n and beautiful, like layers upon layers upon layers of abstraction. And I think it, just like\n\n1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:05.680\n when you're programming, you know, I'm programming in Python, it's awe inspiring to think that\n\n1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:11.360\n underneath it all, it ends up being zeros and ones. And the computer doesn't know about, you know,\n\n1:03:11.360 --> 1:03:16.880\n stupid Python or Windows or Linux. It only knows about the zeros and ones. In the same way with\n\n1:03:16.880 --> 1:03:25.840\n the brain, is there something interesting to you or fundamental to you about the circuitry of the\n\n1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:35.200\n brain that allows for the magic that's in our mind to emerge? How much do we understand? I mean,\n\n1:03:35.200 --> 1:03:41.600\n maybe even focusing on the vision system, is, is there something specific about the structure of\n\n1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:49.600\n the vision system, the circuitry of it that allows for the complexity of the vision system to emerge?\n\n1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:52.400\n Or is it all just the complete chaotic mess that we don't understand?\n\n1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:57.200\n It's definitely not all a chaotic mess that we don't understand, if we're talking about vision.\n\n1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.160\n And that's not just because I'm a vision scientist.\n\n1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:01.200\n Let's stick to vision.\n\n1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:05.520\n Let's stick to vision. Well, because in the beauty of the visual system, the reason David Hubel and\n\n1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:09.680\n Torrance and Wiesel won the Nobel prize was because they were brilliant and forward thinking and\n\n1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:13.680\n adventurous and all that good stuff. But the reason that the visual system is such a great\n\n1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:18.160\n model for addressing these kinds of questions and other systems are hard, is we can control\n\n1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:23.680\n the stimuli. We can adjust spatial frequency, how finer the gratings are, thick gratings,\n\n1:04:23.680 --> 1:04:28.480\n thin gratings. We can adjust temporal frequency, how fast things are moving. We can use cone\n\n1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:33.600\n isolating stimuli. We can use it. There's so many things that you can do in a controlled way.\n\n1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:39.200\n Whereas if we were talking about cognitive encoding, like encoding the space of concepts\n\n1:04:39.200 --> 1:04:46.880\n or something. I, like you, if I may, am drawn to the big questions.\n\n1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:53.680\n The big questions in neuroscience. But I confess in part because of some good advice I got early\n\n1:04:53.680 --> 1:05:01.120\n in my career and in part because I'm not perhaps smart enough to go after the really high level\n\n1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:10.000\n stuff. I also like to address things that are tractable and we need to address what we can\n\n1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.640\n stand to make some ground on at a given time.\n\n1:05:12.640 --> 1:05:18.880\n There you can construct brilliant controlled experiments to study, to really literally\n\n1:05:18.880 --> 1:05:20.160\n answer questions about, yeah.\n\n1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:24.880\n Yeah. I mean, I'm happy to have a talk about consciousness, but it's a scary talk. And I\n\n1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:29.920\n think most people don't want to hear what I have to say, which is, we can save that for later,\n\n1:05:29.920 --> 1:05:30.320\n perhaps.\n\n1:05:30.320 --> 1:05:36.400\n I mean, it's an interesting question of, we talk about psychedelics. We can talk about\n\n1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:42.560\n consciousness. We can talk about cognition. Can experiments in neuroscience be constructed\n\n1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:45.920\n to shed any kind of light on these questions?\n\n1:05:45.920 --> 1:05:52.080\n So, I mean, it's cool that vision, I mean, to me, vision is probably one of the most beautiful\n\n1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:59.040\n things about human beings. Also from the AI side, computer vision has some of the most\n\n1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:04.640\n exciting applications of neural networks is in computer vision. But it feels like that's a\n\n1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:10.000\n that's a neighbor of cognition and consciousness. It's just that we maybe haven't come up with\n\n1:06:10.000 --> 1:06:11.600\n experiments to study those yet.\n\n1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:14.960\n Yeah. The visual system is amazing. We're mostly visual animals to navigate,\n\n1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:22.000\n survive. Humans mainly rely on vision, not smell or something else, but it's a filter\n\n1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:28.000\n for cognition and it's a, it's a strong driver of cognition. Maybe just cause it came up and\n\n1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.880\n then we're moving to higher level concepts. Just the way the visual system works can be\n\n1:06:32.880 --> 1:06:37.840\n summarized in it in a few relatively succinct statements. Unlike most of what I've said,\n\n1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:39.200\n which has not been succinct at all.\n\n1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:39.760\n Let's go there.\n\n1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:47.200\n You know, the retina, yeah. So the retina is this three layers of neuron structure at the\n\n1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:51.520\n back of your eye. It's about as thick as a credit card. It is a piece of your brain.\n\n1:06:51.520 --> 1:06:56.640\n And sometimes people think I'm kind of wriggling by out of a reality by saying that it is,\n\n1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:00.080\n it's absolutely a piece of the brain. It's, it's a forebrain structure that in the first\n\n1:07:00.080 --> 1:07:05.920\n trimester, there's a genetic program that made sure that that neural retina, which is part of\n\n1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:10.960\n your central nervous system was squeezed out into what's called the embryonic eye cups.\n\n1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:14.480\n And that the bone formed with a little hole where the optic nerve is going to connect\n\n1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:20.160\n it to the rest of the brain. And those, that window into the world is the only window into\n\n1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:24.640\n the world for a, for a mammal, which has a thick skull. Birds have a thin skull. So their pineal\n\n1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:29.520\n gland sits and lizards too, and snakes actually have a hole so that light can make it down into\n\n1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:33.520\n the pineal directly. And in train melatonin rhythms for time of day and time of year,\n\n1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:38.720\n humans have to do all that through the eyes. So three layers of neurons that are a piece of your\n\n1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:42.800\n brain, their central nervous system, and the optic nerve connects to the rest of the brain,\n\n1:07:42.800 --> 1:07:48.080\n the neurons in the eye, somewhat just care about luminance, just how bright or dim it is.\n\n1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:52.160\n And they inform the brain about time of day. And then the central circadian clock informs every\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:55.760\n cell in your body about time of day and make sure that all sorts of good stuff happens. If you're\n\n1:07:55.760 --> 1:07:59.760\n getting light in your eyes at the right times and all sorts of bad things happen. If you are getting\n\n1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:04.080\n light randomly throughout the 24 hour cycle, we could talk about all that, but this is a good\n\n1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:09.760\n incentive for keeping a relatively normal schedule, consistent schedule, light exposure,\n\n1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:15.840\n consistent schedule, try and keep a consistent schedule. When you're young, it's easy to go off\n\n1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:20.480\n schedule and recover. As you get older, it gets harder, but you see everything from outcomes in\n\n1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:29.280\n cancer patients to diabetes improves when people are getting light at a particular time of day and\n\n1:08:29.280 --> 1:08:36.400\n getting darkness at a particular phase of the 24 hour cycle. We were designed to get light and\n\n1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:42.560\n dark at different times of the circadian cycle. All that information is coming in through\n\n1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:46.240\n specialized type of neuron in the retina called the melanopsin intrinsically photosensitive\n\n1:08:46.240 --> 1:08:53.040\n ganglion cell discovered by David Berson at Brown University. That's not spatial information. It's\n\n1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:56.640\n subconscious. You don't think, Oh, it's daytime. Even if you're looking at the sun, it doesn't\n\n1:08:56.640 --> 1:09:01.200\n matter. It's a photon counter. It's literally counting photons. And it's saying, Oh, even\n\n1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:05.760\n though it's a cloudy day, lots of photons coming in at winter in Boston, it must be winter. And\n\n1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:09.600\n your system is a little depressed. It's spring. You feel alert. That's not a coincidence. That's\n\n1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:14.080\n these melanopsin cells signaling the circadian clock. There are a bunch of other neurons in the\n\n1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:20.320\n eye that signal to the brain and they mainly signal the presence of things that are lighter\n\n1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:25.360\n than background or darker than background. So a black objects would be darker than background,\n\n1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:29.760\n a light object lighter than background. And that all come, it's mainly it's looking at pixels.\n\n1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:34.240\n Mainly it's they look at circles and those neurons have receptive fields,\n\n1:09:34.240 --> 1:09:38.640\n which not everyone will understand, but those neurons respond best to little circles of dark\n\n1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:43.360\n light or little circles of bright light, little circles of red light versus little circles of\n\n1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:50.320\n green light or blue light. And so it sounds very basic. It's like red, green, blue and circles\n\n1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:55.920\n brighter or dimmer than what's next to it. But that's basically the only information that sent\n\n1:09:55.920 --> 1:10:01.040\n down the optic nerve. And when we say information, we can be very precise. I don't mean little bits\n\n1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:06.800\n of red traveling down the optic nerve. I mean, spikes neural action potentials in space and time,\n\n1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:12.480\n which for you is like makes total sense. But I think for a lot of people, it's actually beautiful\n\n1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:17.280\n to think about all that information in the outside world is converted into a language\n\n1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:21.520\n that's very simple. It's just like a few syllables, if you will. And those syllables\n\n1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:26.720\n are being shouted down the optic nerve, converted into a totally different language, like Morse code\n\n1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:31.360\n goes into the brain. And then the thalamus essentially responds in the same way that\n\n1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:37.680\n the retina does, except the thalamus is also waiting things. It's saying, you know what,\n\n1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:43.680\n that thing was moving faster than everything else, or it's brighter than everything else.\n\n1:10:43.680 --> 1:10:49.840\n So that signal I'm going to get up, I'm going to allow up to cortex or that signal is much\n\n1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:54.160\n redder than it is green. So I'm going to let that signal go through that signal as much.\n\n1:10:54.880 --> 1:10:59.840\n It's kind of more like the red next to it. Throw that out. The information just doesn't get up into\n\n1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:04.560\n your cortex. And then in cortex, of course, is where perceptions happen. And in V1, if you will,\n\n1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:10.160\n visual area one, but also some neighboring areas, you start getting representations of\n\n1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:15.520\n things like oriented lines. So there's a neuron that responds to this angle of my hand versus\n\n1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:21.840\n vertical. This is the defining work of Hubel and Wiesel's Nobel. And it's a very systematic map\n\n1:11:21.840 --> 1:11:28.480\n of orientation, line orientation, direction of movement, and so forth. And that's pretty much,\n\n1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:32.080\n and color, and that's how the visual system is organized all the way up to the cortex.\n\n1:11:32.080 --> 1:11:37.920\n So it's hierarchical. I want to be clear. It's hierarchical because you don't build up that line\n\n1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:43.280\n by suddenly having a neuron that responds to lines in some random way. It responds to lines\n\n1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:48.160\n by taking all the dots that are aligned in a vertical stack, and they all converge on one\n\n1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:53.920\n neuron. And then that neuron responds to vertical lines. So it's not random. There's no abstraction\n\n1:11:53.920 --> 1:11:58.960\n at that point, in fact. In fact, if I showed you a black line, I could be sure that if I\n\n1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:04.880\n were imaging V1, that I would see a representation of that black line as a vertical line somewhere in\n\n1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:12.400\n your cortex. So at that point, it's absolutely concrete. It's not abstract. But then things get\n\n1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:18.320\n really mysterious. Some of that information travels further up into the cortex and goes from\n\n1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:23.360\n one visual area to the next, to the next, to the next, so that by time you get into an area that\n\n1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:30.560\n Nancy Kanwisher at MIT has studied much of her career, the fusiform face area, you start finding\n\n1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:38.560\n single neurons that respond only to your father's face or to Joe Rogan's face, regardless of the\n\n1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:43.760\n orientation of his face. I'm sure if you saw Joe, because you know him well, from across the room\n\n1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:47.520\n and you just saw his profile, you'd be like, oh, that's Joe. Walk over and say hello.\n\n1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:52.640\n The orientation of his face isn't there. You wouldn't even see his eyes necessarily,\n\n1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:57.920\n but he's represented in some abstract way by a neuron that actually would be called the Joe\n\n1:12:57.920 --> 1:13:03.360\n Rogan neuron. He might have limits. I might not recognize him if he was upside down or\n\n1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:08.160\n something like that. It'd be fascinating to see what the limits of that Joe Rogan concept is.\n\n1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:12.400\n So Nancy's lab has done that because early on she was challenged by people that said\n\n1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:17.680\n there aren't face neurons. There are neurons that they only respond to space and time,\n\n1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:22.240\n shapes and things like that, moving in particular directions and orientations. It turns out\n\n1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.920\n Nancy was right. They use these stimuli called greeble stimuli, which any computer programmer\n\n1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:32.080\n would appreciate, which kind of morphs a face into something gradually that eventually just\n\n1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:36.720\n looks like this alien thing they call the greeble. The neurons don't respond to greebles.\n\n1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:42.400\n In most cases, they only respond to faces and familiar faces. Anyway, I'm summarizing a lot\n\n1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.000\n of literature and forgive me, Nancy, and for those of the greeble people, if they're ours,\n\n1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.760\n they're like, don't come after me with pitchforks. Actually, you know what? Come after me with\n\n1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:54.480\n pitchforks. I think you know what I'm trying to do here. So the point is that in the visual system,\n\n1:13:54.480 --> 1:14:00.640\n it's very concrete up until about visual area four, which has color pinwheels and seems to\n\n1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:07.360\n respond to pinwheels of colors. And so the stimuli become more and more elaborate, but at some point\n\n1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:12.480\n you depart that concrete representation and you start getting abstract representations that can't\n\n1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:18.400\n be explained by simple point to point wiring. And to take a leap out of the visual system to\n\n1:14:18.400 --> 1:14:23.840\n the higher level concepts, what we talked about in the visual system maps to the auditory system\n\n1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:29.440\n where you're encoding what? Frequency of tone sweeps. So this is going to sound weird to do,\n\n1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:34.480\n but you know, like a Doppler, like hearing something, a car passing by, for instance,\n\n1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:41.440\n but at some point you get into motifs of music that can't be mapped to just a, what they call a\n\n1:14:41.440 --> 1:14:47.200\n tonotopic map of frequency. You start abstracting. And if you start thinking about concepts of\n\n1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:54.880\n creativity and love and memory, like what is the map of memory space? Well, your memories are very\n\n1:14:54.880 --> 1:15:00.240\n different than mine, but presumably there's enough structure at the early stages of memory processing\n\n1:15:00.240 --> 1:15:05.920\n or at the early stages of emotional processing or at the earlier stages of creative processing\n\n1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:09.920\n that you have the building blocks, your zeros and ones, if you will,\n\n1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:16.960\n but you depart from that eventually. Now the exception to this, and I want to be really clear\n\n1:15:16.960 --> 1:15:22.080\n because I was just mainly talking about neocortex, the six layered structure on the outside of the\n\n1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:28.480\n brain that explains a lot of human abilities, other animals have them too, is that subcortical\n\n1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:35.280\n structures are a lot more like machines. It's more plug and chug. And what I'm talking about\n\n1:15:35.280 --> 1:15:41.360\n is the machinery that controls heart rate and breathing and receptive fields, neurons that\n\n1:15:41.360 --> 1:15:48.560\n respond to things like temperature on the top of my left hand. I came into neuroscience from\n\n1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:54.960\n more of a perspective initially of psychology, but one of the reasons I forced upon myself to learn\n\n1:15:54.960 --> 1:16:00.560\n some electrophysiology, not a ton, but enough, and some molecular biology and about circuitry\n\n1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:06.240\n is that one of the most beautiful experiences you can have in life, I'm convinced, is to lower\n\n1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:13.920\n an electrode into the cortex and to show a person or an animal, we do this ethically of course,\n\n1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:20.560\n stimulus like an oriented line or a face. And you can convert the recordings coming off of\n\n1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:25.360\n that electrode into an audio signal or an audio monitor, and you can hear what they call hash.\n\n1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:31.760\n It's not the hash you smoke, it's the hash you hear. And it sounds like, it just sounds like\n\n1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:37.760\n noise. And in the cortex, eventually you find a stimulus that gets the neuron to spike and\n\n1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:41.920\n fire action potentials that are converted into an auditory stimulus that are very concrete,\n\n1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:47.680\n crack, crack, crack, sounds like a bat cracking, like home runs or outfield balls.\n\n1:16:49.200 --> 1:16:55.680\n When you drop electrodes deeper into the thalamus or into the hypothalamus or into the brainstem\n\n1:16:55.680 --> 1:17:00.800\n areas that control breathing, it's like a machine. You never hear hash. You drop the electrode down.\n\n1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:07.600\n This could be like a grungy old Tugston electrode, not high fidelity electrode, as long as it's got\n\n1:17:07.600 --> 1:17:11.440\n a little bit of insulation on it. You plug it into an audio monitor, it's picking up electricity.\n\n1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.000\n And if it's a visual neuron and it's in the thalamus or the retina and you walk in front\n\n1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:23.360\n of that animal or person, that neuron goes, and then you walk away and it stops. And you put your\n\n1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:30.320\n hand in front of the eye again and it goes, and you could do that for two days. And that neuron\n\n1:17:30.320 --> 1:17:34.560\n will just, every time there's a stimulus, it fires. So whereas before, it's a question of\n\n1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:38.720\n how much information is getting up to cortex. And then these abstractions happening where\n\n1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:43.520\n you're creating these ideas, when you go subcortical, everything is.\n\n1:17:44.560 --> 1:17:45.440\n There's no abstraction.\n\n1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:50.320\n It's two plus two equals four. There's no abstractions. And this is why I know we have\n\n1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:54.640\n some common friends at Neuralink and I love the demonstration they did recently. I'm a huge fan\n\n1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:59.120\n of what they're doing and where they're headed. And no, I don't get paid to say that. And I have\n\n1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:02.880\n no business relationship to them. I'm just a huge fan of the people in the mission.\n\n1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:09.120\n But my question was to some of them, when are you going to go subcortical? Because if you want to\n\n1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:14.720\n control an animal, you don't do it in the cortex. The cortex is like the abstract painting I made\n\n1:18:14.720 --> 1:18:21.120\n of your face. Removing one piece or changing something may or may not matter for the abstraction.\n\n1:18:21.120 --> 1:18:26.000\n But when you are in the subcortical areas of the brain, a stimulating electrode can\n\n1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:31.040\n evoke an entire behavior or an entire state. And so the brain, if we're going to have a\n\n1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:36.560\n discussion about the brain and how the brain works, we need to really be clear which brain,\n\n1:18:36.560 --> 1:18:41.360\n because everyone loves neocortex. It's like, oh, canonical circuits in cortex. We're going to get\n\n1:18:41.360 --> 1:18:47.840\n the cortical connectome. And sure, necessary, but not sufficient. Not to be able to plug in\n\n1:18:47.840 --> 1:18:51.840\n patterns of electrical stimulation and get behavior. Eventually we'll get there. But if\n\n1:18:51.840 --> 1:18:56.400\n you're talking subcortical circuits, that's where the action is. That's where you could potentially\n\n1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:01.600\n cure Parkinson's by stimulating the subthalamic nucleus, because we know that it gates motor\n\n1:19:01.600 --> 1:19:06.320\n activation patterns in very predictable ways. So I think for those that are interested in\n\n1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:11.840\n neuroscience, it pays to pay attention to like, is this a circuit that abstracts the sensory\n\n1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:18.160\n information? Or is it just one that builds up hierarchical models in a very predictable way?\n\n1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:23.280\n And there's a huge chasm in neuroscience right now, because there's no conceptual\n\n1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:28.000\n leadership. No one knows which way to go. And this is why I think Neuralink has captured an\n\n1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:32.320\n amazing opportunity, which was, okay, well, while all you academic research labs are figuring all\n\n1:19:32.320 --> 1:19:37.120\n this stuff out, we're going to pick a very specific goal and make the goal, the end point. And some\n\n1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:42.960\n academic laboratories do that, but I think that's a beautiful way to attack this whole thing about\n\n1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:48.480\n the brain, because it's very concrete. Let's restore motion to the Parkinsonian patient.\n\n1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:54.080\n Academic labs want to do that too, of course. Let's restore speech to the stroke patient.\n\n1:19:54.960 --> 1:19:59.680\n But there's nothing abstract about that. That's about figuring out the solution to a particular\n\n1:19:59.680 --> 1:20:03.920\n problem. So anyway, those are my... And I admit I've mixed in a lot of opinion there,\n\n1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:09.120\n but having spent some time, like 25 years digging around in the brain and listening to neurons\n\n1:20:09.120 --> 1:20:15.680\n firing and looking at them anatomically, I think given it's 2020, we need to ask the right... The\n\n1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:22.080\n way to get better answers is ask better questions. And the really high level stuff is fun. It makes\n\n1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:28.800\n for good conversation and it has brought enormous interest. But I think the questions about\n\n1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:34.240\n consciousness and dreaming and stuff, they're fascinating, but I don't know that we're there yet.\n\n1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:44.240\n So you're saying there might be a chasm in the two views of the power of the brain arising from\n\n1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:53.440\n the circuitry that forms abstractions or the power of the brain arising from the majority\n\n1:20:53.440 --> 1:21:02.000\n of the circuitry that's just doing very brute force, dumb things that don't have any fancy\n\n1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:05.680\n kind of stuff going on. That's really interesting to think about.\n\n1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:11.440\n And which one to go after first. And here I'm poaching badly from someone I've never met,\n\n1:21:11.440 --> 1:21:16.320\n but whose work I follow, which is, and it was actually on your podcast. I think Elon Musk\n\n1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:21.120\n said, basically the brain is a, I want to say a monkey brain with a supercomputer on top.\n\n1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:25.120\n And I thought that's actually probably the best description of the brain I've ever heard because\n\n1:21:25.120 --> 1:21:30.560\n it captures a lot of important features like limbic friction. But we think of like, oh,\n\n1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:34.640\n when we're making plans, we're using the prefrontal cortex and we're executive function\n\n1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:39.520\n and all this kind of stuff. But think about the drug addict who's driven to go pursue\n\n1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:45.040\n heroin or cocaine. They make plans. So clearly they use their frontal cortex. It's just that\n\n1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:49.680\n it's been hijacked by the limbic system and all the monkey brain as he referred to. It's really\n\n1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:53.840\n not fair to monkeys though, Elon, because actually monkeys can make plans. They just don't make plans\n\n1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:57.280\n as sophisticated as us. I've spent a lot of time with monkeys, but I've also spent a lot of time\n\n1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:02.880\n with humans. Anyway, you're saying like, there's a lot of value to focusing on the monkey brain\n\n1:22:02.880 --> 1:22:08.640\n or whatever the heck you call it. I do because let's say I had an ability to place a chip anywhere\n\n1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:14.400\n I wanted in the brain today and activate it or inhibit that area. I'm not sure I would put that\n\n1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:19.440\n chip in neocortex, except maybe to just kind of have some fun and see what happens. The reason\n\n1:22:19.440 --> 1:22:24.000\n is it's an abstraction machine. And especially if I wanted to make a mass production tool,\n\n1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:28.560\n a tool in mass production that I could give to a lot of people, because it's quite possible that\n\n1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:33.440\n your abstractions are different enough than mine that I wouldn't know what patterns of firing to\n\n1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:40.320\n induce. But if I want, let's say I want to increase my level of focus and creativity. Well, then I\n\n1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:45.600\n would love to be able to, for instance, control my level of limbic friction. I would love to be\n\n1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:49.280\n able to wake up and go, Oh, you know what? I have an eight o clock appointment. I wake up slowly.\n\n1:22:49.280 --> 1:22:52.560\n So between seven, eight, but I want to do a lot of linear thinking. So you know what? I'm going to\n\n1:22:52.560 --> 1:23:00.160\n just, I'm going to turn down the limbic friction and or ramp up prefrontal cortexes activation.\n\n1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:04.960\n So there's a lot of stuff that can happen in the thalamus with sensory gating. For instance,\n\n1:23:04.960 --> 1:23:09.920\n you could shut down that shell around the thalamus and allow more creative thinking by allowing more\n\n1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:13.920\n lateral connections. These would be some of the, those would be the experiments I'd want to do.\n\n1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:19.280\n So they're in the subcortical quote unquote monkey brain, but you could then look at what sorts of\n\n1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:26.000\n abstract thoughts and behaviors would arise from that rather than, and here I'm not pointing my\n\n1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:31.120\n finger at neural link at all, but there's this obsession with neocortex, but I, I'm going to,\n\n1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:36.640\n well, I might lose a few friends, but I'll hopefully gain a few. And also one of the\n\n1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:42.960\n reasons people spend so much time in neocortex. Yes. I have a fact and an opinion. One fact is\n\n1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:49.120\n that you can image there and you can record there right now, the two photon and one photon microscopy\n\n1:23:49.120 --> 1:23:53.600\n methods that allow you to image deep into the brain still don't allow you to image down really\n\n1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:57.840\n deep unless you're jamming prisms in there and endoscopes. And then the endoscopes are very\n\n1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:02.000\n narrow. So you're getting very, you know, it's like looking at the bottom of the ocean through a,\n\n1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.840\n through a spotlight. And so you much easier look at the waves up on top. Right. So let's face it,\n\n1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:12.000\n folks. A lot of the reasons why there's so many recordings in layer two, three of cortex with all\n\n1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:17.280\n this advanced microscopy is because it's very hard to image deeper. Now the microscopes are getting\n\n1:24:17.280 --> 1:24:22.640\n better and thanks to the amazing work, mainly of engineers and chemists and physicists. Let's face\n\n1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:26.320\n it. They're the ones who brought this revolution to neuroscience in the last 10 years or so.\n\n1:24:27.040 --> 1:24:33.280\n You can image deeper, but we don't really, that's why you see so many reports on layer two, three.\n\n1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:38.160\n The other thing, which is purely opinion, and I'm not going after anybody here, but is that\n\n1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:43.760\n as long as there's no clear right answer, it becomes a little easier to do creative work\n\n1:24:43.760 --> 1:24:48.640\n in a structure where no one really knows how it works. So it's fun to probe around because anything\n\n1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:54.400\n you see is novel. If you're going to work in the thalamus or the pulvinar or the hypothalamus or\n\n1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:58.160\n these structures that have been known about since the sixties and seventies, and really since the,\n\n1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:04.000\n you know, centuries ago, you are dealing with existing, you have to combat existing models.\n\n1:25:04.720 --> 1:25:10.240\n And whereas in cortex, no one knows how the thing works, the neocortex, six layer cortex.\n\n1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.720\n And so there's a lot more room for discovery. There's a lot more room for discovery and I'm\n\n1:25:14.720 --> 1:25:18.240\n not calling anyone out. I love cortex. We've published some papers on cortex. It's super\n\n1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:24.560\n interesting. But I think with the tools that are available nowadays and where people are trying\n\n1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:29.040\n ahead of, of not just reading from the brain, monitoring activity, but writing to the brain,\n\n1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:34.720\n I think we really have to be careful and we need to be thoughtful about what are we trying to write?\n\n1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:38.400\n What script are we trying to write? Because there are many brain structures for which we already\n\n1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:42.960\n know what scripts they write. And I think there's tremendous value there. I don't think it's boring.\n\n1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:47.680\n The fact that they act like machines makes them predictable. Those are your zeros and ones.\n\n1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:52.080\n Let's start there. But let the, what they're, what's sort of happening in this field of writing\n\n1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:56.000\n to the brain is there's this idea. And again, I want to be clear. I'm not pointing at Neuralink.\n\n1:25:56.000 --> 1:26:02.880\n I'm mainly pointing at the neocortical jockeys out there that you go and you observe patterns.\n\n1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:06.880\n And then you think replaying those patterns is going to give rise to something interesting.\n\n1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.280\n Yeah. I should call out one experiment or two experiments, which were done by Susumu\n\n1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:16.720\n Tonagawa, Nobel prize winner from MIT, done important work in memory and immunology,\n\n1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:21.680\n of course, is where he got his Nobel as well as Mark Mayford's lab at UC San Diego.\n\n1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:25.680\n They did an experiment where they monitored a bunch of neurons while an animal learned something.\n\n1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:31.280\n Then they captured those neurons through some molecular tricks so they could replay the neurons.\n\n1:26:32.080 --> 1:26:35.200\n So now there's like perfect case scenario. It's like, okay,\n\n1:26:35.200 --> 1:26:40.080\n you monitor the neurons in your brain. Then I say, okay, neurons one through 100 were played\n\n1:26:40.080 --> 1:26:43.440\n in the particular sequence. So, you know, the space time, you know, the keys on the piano that\n\n1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:47.600\n were played that gave rise to the song, which was the behavior. And then you go back and you\n\n1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:52.800\n reactivate those neurons, except you reactivate them all at once, like slamming on all the keys\n\n1:26:52.800 --> 1:27:00.320\n once on the piano and you get the exact same behavior. So the space time code\n\n1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:07.760\n may be meaningless for some structures. Now that's freaky. That's a scary thing because what that\n\n1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:16.000\n means is that all the space time firing in cortex, the space part may matter more than the time part.\n\n1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.920\n So, you know, rate codes and space time codes, we don't know. And, you know, I'd rather have,\n\n1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:25.840\n I'd rather deliver more answers in this discussion questions, but I think it's an important\n\n1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:31.760\n consideration. You're saying some of the magic is in the early stages of what the closer to the\n\n1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:38.080\n raw information. I believe so. You know, the stimulus, you know, the neuron that encodes\n\n1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:42.640\n that stimulus. So, you know, the transformation. When I say this for those who don't think about\n\n1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:48.960\n sensory transformations, it's like, I can show you a red circle. And then I look at how many times\n\n1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:52.880\n the neuron fires in response to that red circle. And then I could show the red circle a bunch of\n\n1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:56.800\n times, green circle, see if it changes. And then essentially the number of times that is the\n\n1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:02.240\n transformation. You've converted red circle into like three action potentials, you know, beep, beep,\n\n1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:05.120\n beep, or whatever you want to call it, you know, for those that think in sound space.\n\n1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:09.680\n So that's what you've created, you know, the transformation and you march up the,\n\n1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:16.640\n it's called the neuro axis as you go from the periphery up into the cortex. And we know that,\n\n1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:25.280\n and I know Lisa Feldman Barrett, or is it Barrett Feldman? Barrett Feldman, excuse me,\n\n1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:30.080\n Lisa, that talked a lot about this, that, you know, birds can do sophisticated things and whatnot as\n\n1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:35.120\n well, but humans, there's a strong, what we call cephalization. A lot of the processing\n\n1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:39.920\n has moved up into the cortex and out of these subcortical areas, but it happens nonetheless.\n\n1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:44.640\n And so as long as you know the transformations, you are in a perfect place to build machines\n\n1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:51.120\n or add machines to the brain that exactly mimic what the brain wants to do, which is take events\n\n1:28:51.120 --> 1:28:55.200\n in the environment and turn them into internal firing of neurons.\n\n1:28:55.200 --> 1:28:59.440\n So the mastery of the brain can happen at their early level. You know, another perspective of it\n\n1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:07.200\n is you saying this means that humans aren't that special. If we look at the evolutionary time scale,\n\n1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:12.480\n the leap to intelligence is not that special. So like the extra layers of abstraction\n\n1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:18.000\n isn't where most of the magic happens of intelligence, which gives me hope that maybe,\n\n1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:22.800\n if that's true, that means the evolution of intelligence is not that rare of an event.\n\n1:29:23.440 --> 1:29:24.640\n I certainly hope not.\n\n1:29:24.640 --> 1:29:27.200\n Oh, so you hope there's...\n\n1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:31.840\n I hope there are other forms of intelligence. I mean, I think what humans are really good at,\n\n1:29:32.880 --> 1:29:38.240\n and here I want to be clear that this is not a formal model, but what humans are really good at\n\n1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:45.040\n is taking that plasma barbell that we were talking about earlier and not just using it for analysis\n\n1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:50.400\n of space, like the intermediate environment, but also using historical information. Like I can read\n\n1:29:50.400 --> 1:29:54.240\n a book today about the history of medicine. I happen to be doing that lately for some stuff\n\n1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:58.560\n I'm researching and I can take that information and if I want, I can inject it into my plans for\n\n1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:06.080\n the future. Other animals don't seem to do that over the same time scales that we do. Now,\n\n1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:10.960\n it may be that the chipmunks are all hiding little notebooks everywhere in the form of little dirt\n\n1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:15.600\n castles or something that we don't understand. I mean, the waggle dance of the bee is in the most\n\n1:30:15.600 --> 1:30:21.600\n famous example. Bees come back to the hive, they orient relative to the honeycomb and they waggle.\n\n1:30:21.600 --> 1:30:25.840\n There's a guy down in Australia named Serena Vasson who studied this. It's really interesting.\n\n1:30:25.840 --> 1:30:32.400\n No one really understands it except he understands it best. The bee waggles in a couple of ways\n\n1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:38.000\n relative to the orientation of the honeycomb and then all the other bees see that it's visual and\n\n1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.440\n they go out and they know the exact coordinate system to get to the source of whatever it was,\n\n1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:47.760\n the food and bring it back. He's done it where they isolate the bees, he's changed the visual\n\n1:30:47.760 --> 1:30:52.240\n flight environment, all this stuff. They are communicating and they're communicating something\n\n1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:57.760\n about something they saw recently, but it doesn't extend over very long periods of time.\n\n1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:02.000\n The same way that you and I can both read a book or you can recommend something to me and then we\n\n1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:07.680\n could converge on a set of ideas later. And in fairness, because she was the one that said it\n\n1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:12.560\n and I didn't and I hadn't even thought of it, when you talk to Lisa on your podcast,\n\n1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:18.320\n she brought up something beautiful, which is that it never really occurred to me and I was\n\n1:31:18.320 --> 1:31:23.760\n sort of embarrassed that it hadn't, but it's really beautiful and brilliant, which is that\n\n1:31:23.760 --> 1:31:28.400\n we don't just encode senses in the form of like color and light and sound waves and taste,\n\n1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:35.120\n but ideas become a form of sensory mapping. And that's where the really, really cool and\n\n1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:38.880\n exciting stuff is, but we just don't understand what the receptive fields are for ideas. What's\n\n1:31:38.880 --> 1:31:42.480\n an idea receptive field? And how they're communicated\n\n1:31:43.840 --> 1:31:49.280\n between humans because we seem to be able to encode those ideas in some kind of way.\n\n1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:54.320\n You'd be able to encode those ideas in some kind of way. Yes, it's taking all the raw information\n\n1:31:54.320 --> 1:32:01.040\n and the internal physical states, that sensory information put into this concept blob that we\n\n1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:04.880\n cut in the store and then we're able to communicate that. Yeah, your abstractions are different than\n\n1:32:04.880 --> 1:32:10.880\n mine. I actually think the comment section on social media is a beautiful example of where\n\n1:32:10.880 --> 1:32:15.680\n the abstractions are different for different people. So much of the misunderstanding of the\n\n1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:22.400\n world is because of these idea receptive fields, they're not the same. Whereas I can look at a\n\n1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:28.320\n photoreceptor neuron or olfactory neuron or a V1 neuron, and I am certain, I would bet my life\n\n1:32:28.320 --> 1:32:34.640\n that yours look and respond exactly the same way that Lisa's do and mine do. But once you get\n\n1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:39.680\n beyond there, it gets tricky. And so when you say something or I say something and somebody gets\n\n1:32:39.680 --> 1:32:45.520\n upset about it or even happy about it, their concept of that might be quite a bit different.\n\n1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:49.200\n They don't really know what you mean. They only know what it means to them.\n\n1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:55.040\n Yeah. So from a neural link perspective, it makes sense to optimize the control and the\n\n1:32:55.040 --> 1:33:03.040\n augmentation of the more primitive circuitry. So like the stuff that is closer to the raw sensory\n\n1:33:03.040 --> 1:33:08.160\n information. Go deeper. If they, I think, go deeper into the brain. And to be fair,\n\n1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:13.680\n so Matt McDougall, who's a neurosurgeon at Neuralink and also a clinical nurse, a great guy,\n\n1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:18.000\n brilliant. They have amazing people. I have to give it to them. They've been very cryptic in\n\n1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:23.920\n recent years. Their website was just like nothing there. They really know how to do things with\n\n1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:30.320\n style. And they've upset a lot of people, but that's good too. But Matt is there. I know Matt,\n\n1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:34.080\n he actually came up through my lab at Stanford, although he was a neurosurgery resume. He spent\n\n1:33:34.080 --> 1:33:38.480\n time in our lab. He actually came out on the shark dive and did great white shark diving with my lab\n\n1:33:38.480 --> 1:33:44.240\n to collect the VR that we use in our fear stuff. I've talked to Matt and I think he and other folks\n\n1:33:44.240 --> 1:33:49.760\n there are hungry for the deeper brain structures. The problem is that damn vasculature, all that\n\n1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:56.080\n blood supply. It's not trivial to get through and down into the brain without damaging the\n\n1:33:56.080 --> 1:33:59.920\n vasculature in the neocortex, which is on the outer crust. But once you start getting into\n\n1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:04.960\n the thalamus and closer to some of the main arterial sources, you really risk getting massive\n\n1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:12.560\n bleeds. And so it's an issue that can be worked out. It just is hard. Maybe it'd be nice to educate.\n\n1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:19.600\n I'm sure my ignorance. So the smart stuff is on the surface. So I didn't realize this. I didn't\n\n1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:26.160\n quite realize because you keep saying deep. Yeah. So like the early stages are deep.\n\n1:34:26.160 --> 1:34:33.360\n Yeah. So in actual, physically in the brain. Yeah. So the way that, of course you got your\n\n1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:36.560\n deep brain structures, they're involved in breathing and heart rate and kind of lizard\n\n1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:42.480\n brain stuff. And then on top of that, this is the model of the brain that no one really subscribes\n\n1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:46.720\n to anymore, but anatomically it works. And then on top in mammals. And then on top of that,\n\n1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:50.800\n you have the limbic structures, which gate sensory information and decide whether or not\n\n1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:53.280\n you're going to listen to something more than you're going to look at it, or you're going to\n\n1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:59.840\n split your attention to both kind of sensory allocation stuff. And then the neocortex is on\n\n1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:06.560\n the outside. And that is where you get a lot of this abstraction stuff. And now not all cortical\n\n1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:11.600\n areas are doing abstraction. Some like visual area one, auditory area one, they're just doing\n\n1:35:11.600 --> 1:35:17.840\n concrete representations. But as you get into the higher order stuff, that when you start hearing\n\n1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:22.720\n names like inferoparietal cortex, and when you start hearing multiple names in the same, then\n\n1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:27.680\n you're talking about higher order areas. But actually there's an important experiment that\n\n1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:33.440\n drives a lot of what people want to do with brain machine interface. And that's the work of Bill\n\n1:35:33.440 --> 1:35:38.000\n Newsome, who is at Stanford and Tony Movshin, who runs the Center for Neuroscience at NYU.\n\n1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:42.800\n This is a wild experiment. And I think it might freak a few people out if they really think about\n\n1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:50.800\n it too deeply. But anyway, here it goes. There's an area called MT in the cortex. And if I showed\n\n1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:57.120\n you a bunch of dots all moving up, and this is what Tony and Bill and some of the other people\n\n1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:02.160\n in that lab did way back when, is they show a bunch of dots moving up. Somewhere in MT,\n\n1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.560\n there's some neurons that respond. They fire when the neurons move up. And then what they did is\n\n1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:10.800\n they started varying the coherence of that motion. So they made it so only 50% of the dots moved up\n\n1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:15.520\n and the rest move randomly. And that neuron fires a little less. And eventually it's random and that\n\n1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:19.360\n neuron stops firing because it's just kind of dots moving everywhere. It's awesome. And there's a\n\n1:36:19.360 --> 1:36:24.000\n systematic map so that other neurons are responding and things moving down and other things responding\n\n1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.400\n left and other things moving right. Okay. So there's a map of direction space. Okay, well,\n\n1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:34.640\n that's great. You could lesion MT, animals lose the ability to do these kind of coherence\n\n1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:39.360\n discrimination or direction discrimination. But the amazing experiment, the one that just\n\n1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:46.480\n is kind of eerie is that they lowered a stimulating electrode into MT, found a neuron\n\n1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:54.800\n that responds to when dots go up, but then they silence that neuron. And sure enough,\n\n1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:59.920\n the animal doesn't recognize the neurons are going up and then they move the dots down.\n\n1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:08.960\n They stimulate the neuron that responds to things moving up and the animal responds because it can't\n\n1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:13.440\n speak. It responds by doing a lever press, which says the dots are moving up. So in other words,\n\n1:37:13.440 --> 1:37:19.440\n the sensory, the dots are moving down in reality on the computer screen. They're stimulating the\n\n1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:25.360\n neuron that responds to dots moving up. And the perception of the animal is that dots are moving\n\n1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:32.560\n up, which tells you that your perception of external reality absolutely has to be a neuronal\n\n1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:39.680\n abstraction. It is not tacked to the movement of the dots in any absolute way. Your perception\n\n1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:45.600\n of the outside world depends entirely on the activation patterns of neurons in the brain.\n\n1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:51.920\n And you can hear that and say, well, duh, because if I stimulate the stretch reflex and you kick or\n\n1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:55.760\n something or whatever, the knee reflex and you kick, of course, there's a neuron that triggers\n\n1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:01.520\n that, but it didn't have to be that way. Because A, the animal had prior experience, B, you're way\n\n1:38:01.520 --> 1:38:08.880\n up in the higher order cortical areas. What this means is that, and I generally try and avoid\n\n1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:14.960\n conversations about this kind of thing, but what this means is that we are constructing our reality\n\n1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:20.400\n with this space time firing the zeros and ones. And it doesn't have to have anything to do with\n\n1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:25.920\n the actual reality. And the animal or person can be absolutely convinced that that's what's\n\n1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:35.040\n happening. Are you familiar with the work of Donald Hoffman? So he makes an evolutionary argument\n\n1:38:35.040 --> 1:38:46.880\n that's not important of that. We, our brains are completely detached from reality in the sense that\n\n1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:54.000\n he makes a radical case that we have no idea what physical reality is. And in fact,\n\n1:38:54.000 --> 1:39:02.480\n it's drastically different than what we think it is. So he goes, that's scary. So he doesn't say\n\n1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:08.640\n like there's just, cause you're kind of implying there's a gap. There might be a gap with constructing\n\n1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:17.040\n an illusion and then maybe using communication to maybe create a consistency that's sufficient for\n\n1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:23.360\n human collaboration or whatever, or mammal, you know, just maybe even just life forms constructing\n\n1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:28.480\n a consistent reality that's maybe detached. I mean, that's really cool that neurons are constructing\n\n1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:34.800\n that, like that you can prove that this is when neuroscience at its best vision science. But he\n\n1:39:34.800 --> 1:39:43.280\n says that like our brain is actually just lost its shit on the, on the, on the path of evolution to\n\n1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:49.200\n where we're normal. We're just playing games with each other in constructing realities that allow\n\n1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:54.880\n our survival. But it's, it's, it's completely detached from physical reality. We're missing a\n\n1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:04.240\n lot. We're missing like most of it, if not all of it. Well, this was, it's, it's fascinating because\n\n1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:09.520\n I just saw the Oliver Sacks documentary. There's a new documentary out about his life. And there's\n\n1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:14.160\n this one part where he's like, I've spent part of my life trying to imagine what it would like to be,\n\n1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:21.840\n be, to be a bat or something, to see the world through the life, the sensory apparatus of a bat.\n\n1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.240\n And he did this with his, these patients that were locked into these horrible syndromes that\n\n1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:31.040\n to pull out some of the, the beauty of their experience as well, not just communicate the\n\n1:40:31.040 --> 1:40:35.520\n suffering, although the suffering too. And as I was listening to him talk about this,\n\n1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:40.000\n I started to realize it's like, well, what, you know, like they're these mantis shrimps that can\n\n1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:44.800\n see 60 shades of pink or something. And they, they see this stuff all the time and animals,\n\n1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:50.400\n they can see UV light. Every time I learn about an animal that can sense other things in the\n\n1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:55.600\n environment that I can't like heat sensing, well, not, I don't crave that experience the same way\n\n1:40:55.600 --> 1:41:00.880\n Sacks talked about craving that experience, but it does throw another penny in the jar for what\n\n1:41:00.880 --> 1:41:06.560\n you're saying, which is that it could be that most, if not all of what I perceive and believe\n\n1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:14.400\n is just a neural fabrication and that for better, for worse, we all agree on enough\n\n1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:18.560\n of the same neural fabrications in the same time and place that we're able to function.\n\n1:41:18.560 --> 1:41:21.600\n Not only that, but we agree with the things that are trying to eat us\n\n1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:29.440\n enough to where we don't, they don't eat us. Meaning like that it's not just us humans,\n\n1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:30.560\n you know, right?\n\n1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.000\n I see. Because it's interactive.\n\n1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:39.760\n It's interactive. So like, so like now I think it's a really nice thought experiment.\n\n1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:47.600\n I think because Donald really frames it in a scientific, like he makes a hard,\n\n1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:53.040\n like as hard as our discussion has been now, he makes a hard scientific case that\n\n1:41:53.040 --> 1:42:00.240\n we don't know shit about reality. I think that's a little bit hardcore, but I think it's,\n\n1:42:00.800 --> 1:42:06.400\n I think it's hardcore, but I think it's a good thought experiment that kind of cleanses the\n\n1:42:06.400 --> 1:42:13.840\n palette of the confidence we might have about, because we are operating in this abstraction\n\n1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:21.040\n space, you know, and, you know, the sensory space, it might be something very different.\n\n1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:27.040\n And it's kind of interesting to think about if you start to go into the realm of Neuralink or\n\n1:42:27.040 --> 1:42:31.200\n start to talk about just everything that you've been talking about with dream states and\n\n1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:36.960\n psychedelics and stuff like that, which part of the, which layer can we control and play\n\n1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:40.640\n around with to maybe look into a different slice of reality?\n\n1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:47.120\n I just got to do the experiment. The key is to just do the experiment in the most ethical way\n\n1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:53.360\n possible. You just, I mean, that's the beauty of experiments. This is why, you know, there's\n\n1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:59.280\n wonderful theoretical neuroscience happening now to make predictions. But that's why experimental\n\n1:42:59.280 --> 1:43:03.520\n science is so wonderful. You can go into the laboratory and poke around in there and be a\n\n1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:09.600\n brain explorer and listen to and write to neurons. And when you do that, you get answers. You don't\n\n1:43:09.600 --> 1:43:14.480\n always get the answers you want, but that's, you know, that's the beauty of it. When you were\n\n1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:20.160\n saying this thing about reality and the Donald Hoffman model, I was thinking about children,\n\n1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:28.480\n you know, like when I have an older sister, she's very sane. But when she was a kid, she had an\n\n1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:33.360\n imaginary friend and she would play with this imaginary friend. And it had, there was this\n\n1:43:33.360 --> 1:43:37.520\n whole, there was a consistency. This friend was like, it was Larry lived in a purple house.\n\n1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:42.000\n Larry was a girl. It was like all this stuff that a child, a young child wouldn't have any issue\n\n1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.160\n with. And then one day she announced that Larry had died. Right. And it wasn't traumatic or\n\n1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:51.840\n traumatic and that was it. And she just stopped. And I always wonder what that neuro developmental\n\n1:43:51.840 --> 1:44:02.560\n event was that kept her out of a psychiatric ward had she kept that imaginary friend. But it's also,\n\n1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:06.400\n there was something kind of sad to it. I think the way it was told to me, cause I'm the younger\n\n1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:10.400\n brother, I didn't, I wasn't around for that. But my, my dad told me that, you know, there was a\n\n1:44:10.400 --> 1:44:14.320\n kind of a sadness because it was this beautiful reality that had been constructed. And so we kind\n\n1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:19.600\n of won. I wonder as you're telling me this, whether or not, you know, as adults, we try and\n\n1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:24.080\n create as much reality for children as we can so that they can make predictions and feel safe\n\n1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:28.640\n because the ability to make predictions is a lot of what keeps our autonomic arousal in check. I\n\n1:44:28.640 --> 1:44:33.440\n mean, we go to sleep every night and we give up total control and that should frighten us deeply.\n\n1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:38.480\n But you know, unfortunately, autonomic arousal, the yanks us down under and we don't negotiate\n\n1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:44.960\n too much. So you sleep sooner or later. I don't know. I was a little worried. We get into\n\n1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:49.040\n discussions about the nature of reality because I'm I it's interesting in the laboratory. I'm a\n\n1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:53.120\n very much like, what's the experiment? What would the, you know, what's the analysis going to look\n\n1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:57.840\n like? What mutant mouse are we going to use? What, what, what experience are we going to put\n\n1:44:57.840 --> 1:45:02.880\n someone through? But I think it's wonderful that in 2020, we can finally have discussions about\n\n1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:08.720\n this stuff and look, kind of peek around the corner and say, well, Neuralink and people,\n\n1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:13.200\n others who are doing similar things are going to figure it out. They're going to,\n\n1:45:13.200 --> 1:45:16.720\n the answers will show up and we just have to be open to interpretation.\n\n1:45:17.440 --> 1:45:21.920\n Do you think there could be an experiment centered around consciousness? I mean,\n\n1:45:21.920 --> 1:45:27.280\n you're plugged into the neuroscience community. I think for the longest time, the quote unquote\n\n1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:33.200\n C word was totally not, was almost anti scientific, but now more and more people are\n\n1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:38.320\n talking about consciousness. Elon is talking about consciousness. AI folks are talking about\n\n1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:46.400\n consciousness. It's, it's still nobody knows anything, but it feels like a legitimate domain\n\n1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:57.040\n of inquiry. That's hungry for a real experiment. So I have fortunately three short answers to\n\n1:45:57.040 --> 1:46:05.600\n this. The first one is, I'm not, I'm not particularly succinct. I agree that the joke\n\n1:46:05.600 --> 1:46:10.720\n I always tell is there are two things you never want to say to a scientist. One is what do you\n\n1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:14.720\n do? And the second one is take as much time as you need. And you definitely don't want to say\n\n1:46:14.720 --> 1:46:21.600\n them in the same sentence. I have three short answers to it. So there's a, there's a cynical\n\n1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:29.840\n answer kind of, and it's not one I enjoy giving, which is that if you look into the seventies and\n\n1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:35.920\n eight back at the 1970s and 1980s, and even into the early two thousands, there were some very\n\n1:46:35.920 --> 1:46:42.640\n dynamic, very impressive speakers who are very smart in the field of neuroscience and related\n\n1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:48.960\n fields who thought hard about the consciousness problem and fell in love with the problem,\n\n1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:58.200\n but overlook the fact that the technology wasn't there. So I admire them for falling in love with\n\n1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:06.440\n the problem, but they gleaned tremendous taxpayer resources essentially for nothing. And these\n\n1:47:06.440 --> 1:47:10.080\n people know who they are. Some of them are alive. Some of them aren't. I'm not referring to Francis\n\n1:47:10.080 --> 1:47:13.520\n Crick, who was brilliant by the way, and thought the claustrum was involved in consciousness,\n\n1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:17.680\n which I think is a great idea. It's this obscure structure that no one's really studied. People\n\n1:47:17.680 --> 1:47:22.160\n are now starting to study it. So I think Francis was brilliant and wonderful, but there it, you\n\n1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:29.040\n know, there were books written about it. It makes for great television stuff and thought\n\n1:47:30.320 --> 1:47:35.760\n around the table or after a couple of glasses of wine or whatever. It's an important problem\n\n1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:41.120\n nonetheless. And so I think, I do think the consciousness, the issue is it's not operationally\n\n1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:48.480\n defined, right? That psychologists are much smarter than a lot of hard scientists in that\n\n1:47:48.480 --> 1:47:54.080\n for the following reason, they put operational definitions. They know that psychology, if we're\n\n1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:58.000\n talking about motivation, for instance, they know they need to put operational definitions on that\n\n1:47:58.000 --> 1:48:02.400\n so that two laboratories can know they're studying the same thing. The problem with consciousness is\n\n1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:08.240\n no one can agree on what that is. And this was a problem for attention when I was coming up. So in\n\n1:48:08.240 --> 1:48:11.680\n the early two thousands, people would argue, what is attention? Is it spatial attention,\n\n1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:16.560\n auditory attention? Is it, and finally people were like, you know what, we agree.\n\n1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:17.680\n Have they agreed on that one?\n\n1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:17.920\n Sort of.\n\n1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:21.520\n I remember hearing people scream about attention.\n\n1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:24.880\n Right. They couldn't even agree on attention. So I was coming up as a young graduate student,\n\n1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:28.480\n I'm thinking like, I'm definitely not going to work on attention and I'm definitely not\n\n1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:33.360\n going to work on consciousness. And I wanted something that I could solve or figure out.\n\n1:48:33.360 --> 1:48:37.520\n I want to be able to see the circuit or the neurons. I want to be able to hear it on the\n\n1:48:37.520 --> 1:48:41.360\n audio. I want to record from it. And then I want to do gain a function and loss a function,\n\n1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:46.080\n take it away, see something change, put it back, see something change in a systematic way.\n\n1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:51.840\n And that takes you down into the depths of some stuff that's pretty plug and chug, you know,\n\n1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:56.240\n but you know, I'll borrow from something in the military because I'm fortunate to do some work\n\n1:48:56.240 --> 1:49:00.160\n with units from special operations and they have beautiful language around things because their\n\n1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:04.960\n world is not abstract. And they talk about three meter targets, 10 meter targets and 100 meter\n\n1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:09.200\n targets. And it's not an issue of picking the 100 meter target because it's more beautiful\n\n1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:12.960\n or because it's more interesting. If you don't take down the three meter targets and the 10\n\n1:49:12.960 --> 1:49:19.840\n meter targets first, you're dead. So that's, I think scientists could pay to, you know, adopt\n\n1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:26.560\n a more kind of military thinking in that, in that sense. The other thing that is really important is\n\n1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:30.880\n that just because somebody conceived of something and can talk about it beautifully and can glean a\n\n1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:37.520\n lot of resources for it, doesn't mean that it's led anywhere. So this isn't just true of the\n\n1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:41.200\n consciousness issue. And I don't want to sound cynical, but I could pull up some names of\n\n1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:47.920\n molecules that occupied hundreds of articles in the very premier journals that then were later\n\n1:49:47.920 --> 1:49:54.560\n discovered to be totally moot for that process. And biotech companies folded everyone in the lab\n\n1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:59.360\n pivots and starts doing something different with that molecule. And nobody talks about it because\n\n1:49:59.360 --> 1:50:03.440\n as long as you're in the game, we have this thing called anonymous peer review. You can't afford to\n\n1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:09.360\n piss off anybody too much, unless you have some other funding stream. And I have avoided battles\n\n1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:14.480\n most of my career, but I pay attention to all of it. And I've watched this and I don't think it's\n\n1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:18.560\n ego driven. I think it's that people fall in love with an idea. I don't think there's any,\n\n1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:22.240\n there's not enough money in science for people to sit back there rubbing their hands together,\n\n1:50:22.240 --> 1:50:28.160\n you know, the beauty of what Neuralink and Elon and team, cause obviously he's very impressive,\n\n1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:34.800\n but the team as a whole is really what gives me great confidence in their mission is that he's\n\n1:50:34.800 --> 1:50:41.680\n already got enough money. So it can't be about that. He doesn't seem to need it at a level of,\n\n1:50:41.680 --> 1:50:46.160\n I don't know him, but it doesn't, he doesn't seem to need it at a kind of an ego level or something.\n\n1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:52.480\n I think it's driven by genuine curiosity and the team that he's assembled include people that are\n\n1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:58.480\n very kind of abstract neuro neocortex, space time coding people. There are people like Matt,\n\n1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:05.360\n who is a neurosurgeon. You can't, I mean, you know, you can't BS neurosurgery. Failures in\n\n1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:10.080\n neurosurgery are not tolerated. So you have to be very good to exceptional to even get through the\n\n1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:15.040\n gate. And he's exceptional. And then they've got people like Dan Adams, who was at UCSF for a long\n\n1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:20.720\n time as a good friend and a known him for years, who is very concrete studied the vasculature in\n\n1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:24.560\n the eye and how it maps to the vasculature and cortex. When you get a team like that together,\n\n1:51:25.120 --> 1:51:29.440\n you're going to have dissenters. You're going to have people that are high level thinkers,\n\n1:51:29.440 --> 1:51:34.800\n people that are coders. When you get a team like that, it no longer looks like an academic laboratory\n\n1:51:34.800 --> 1:51:40.640\n or even a field in science. And so I think they're going to solve some really hard problems.\n\n1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:47.680\n And again, I'm not here. They don't, you know, I have nothing at stake with them, but I think\n\n1:51:47.680 --> 1:51:51.760\n that's the solution. You need a bunch of people who don't need first author papers,\n\n1:51:52.320 --> 1:51:56.640\n who don't need to complete their PhD, who aren't relying on outside funding, who have a clear\n\n1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:03.200\n mission. And you have a bunch of people who are basically will adapt to solve the problem.\n\n1:52:03.200 --> 1:52:06.560\n I like the analogy of the three meter target and the a hundred meter target.\n\n1:52:07.200 --> 1:52:11.760\n So the folks at Neuralink are basically many of them are some of the best people in the world at\n\n1:52:11.760 --> 1:52:17.280\n the three meter target. Like you mentioned Matt and neurosurgery, like they're solving real problems.\n\n1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:23.360\n There's no BS, philosophical smokes and weed and look back and look at the stars. But\n\n1:52:26.480 --> 1:52:31.040\n so both on Elon and because I think like this, I think it's really important to think about\n\n1:52:31.920 --> 1:52:36.560\n the hundred meter and the hundred meter is not even a hundred meter, but like\n\n1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:48.720\n like the stuff behind the hill that's too far away, which is where I put consciousness. Maybe\n\n1:52:50.560 --> 1:52:56.320\n I tend to believe that consciousness can be engineered. I mean, part of the reason,\n\n1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:04.880\n part of the business I want to build leverages that idea that consciousness is a lot simpler\n\n1:53:04.880 --> 1:53:10.160\n than we've been talking about. Well, if someone can simplify the problem,\n\n1:53:10.160 --> 1:53:14.640\n right, that will be wonderful. I mean, the reason we can talk about something as abstract as face\n\n1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:19.760\n representations, infusive form face area is because Nancy Kanwisher had the brilliance\n\n1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:26.720\n to tie it to the kind of lower level statistics of visual scenes. It wasn't because she was like,\n\n1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:31.760\n oh, I bet it's there. That wouldn't have been interesting. So people like her understand how\n\n1:53:31.760 --> 1:53:38.240\n to bridge that gap and they put a tractable definition. So I, so I just, I, that's what\n\n1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:43.200\n I'm begging for in science is a tractable definition. This is what, but I want people\n\n1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:50.160\n to sit in the, I want people who are really uncomfortable with woo woo, like consciousness,\n\n1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:55.840\n like high level stuff to sit in that topic and sit uncomfortably because it forces them\n\n1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:00.560\n to then try to ground and simplify it into something that's concrete because too many\n\n1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:05.760\n people are just uncomfortable to sit in the consciousness room because there's no definitions.\n\n1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:11.200\n It's like attention or, or intelligence in the artificial intelligence community. But the reality\n\n1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:16.720\n is it's easy to avoid that room altogether, which is what, I mean, there's analogies to everything\n\n1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:22.800\n you've said with the artificial intelligence community with Minsky and even Alan Turing that\n\n1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:27.280\n talked about intelligence a lot. And then they drew a lot of funding and then it crashed because\n\n1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:31.920\n they really didn't do anything with it. And it was a lot of force of personality and so on. But that\n\n1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:38.960\n doesn't mean the topic of the Turing test and intelligence isn't something we should sit on\n\n1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:44.480\n and think like, think like, what is, well, first of all, Turing actually attempted this with the\n\n1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:49.520\n Turing test. He tried to make concrete this very question of intelligence. It doesn't mean that\n\n1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:58.320\n we shouldn't linger on it. And we shouldn't forget that ultimately that is what our efforts are all\n\n1:54:58.320 --> 1:55:04.800\n about in the artificial intelligence community. And in the people, whether it's neuroscience or\n\n1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:11.680\n whatever bigger umbrella you want to use for understanding the mind, the goal is not just\n\n1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:18.400\n about understanding layer two or three of the vision. It's, it's to understand consciousness\n\n1:55:18.400 --> 1:55:25.840\n and intelligence and maybe create it or just all the possible biggest questions of our universe.\n\n1:55:25.840 --> 1:55:29.600\n That's, that's ultimately the dream. Absolutely. And I think what I really\n\n1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:34.720\n appreciate about what you're saying is that everybody, whether or not they're working on a\n\n1:55:34.720 --> 1:55:39.840\n kind of a low level synapse, that's like a reflex and the musculature or something very high level\n\n1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:45.840\n abstract can benefit from looking at those who prefer three, you know, everyone's going after a\n\n1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:50.800\n three meter, 10 meter and a hundred meter targets in some sense, but to be able to tolerate the\n\n1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:56.000\n discomfort of being in a conversation where there are real answers, where the zeros and ones are,\n\n1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.400\n are known zeros and ones are those, the equivalent of that in the nervous system.\n\n1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:05.120\n And also, as you said, for the people that are very much like, Oh, I can only trust what I can\n\n1:56:05.120 --> 1:56:10.160\n see and touch. Those people need to put themselves into the discomfort of the high level conversation\n\n1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:19.360\n because what's missing is conversation and conceptualization of things at multiple levels.\n\n1:56:19.360 --> 1:56:24.160\n I think one of the, this is, um, I don't gripe about my life's been fortunate. We've been funded\n\n1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:29.920\n from the start and we've been happy, um, in that, in that regard and lucky, and we're grateful for\n\n1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:37.440\n that. But I think one of the challenges of research being so expensive is that there isn't a lot of\n\n1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:43.200\n time, especially nowadays for people to just convene around a topic because there's so much\n\n1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:48.400\n emphasis on productivity. Um, and so there, there are actually, believe it or not, there aren't that\n\n1:56:48.400 --> 1:56:54.480\n many concepts, formal concepts in neuroscience right now. The last 10 years has been this huge\n\n1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:59.440\n influx of tools. And so people in neural circuits and probing around and connect homes, it's been\n\n1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:05.600\n wonderful, but w you know, 10, 20 years ago, when the consciousness stuff was more prominent,\n\n1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:11.280\n the C word, as you said, um, what was good about that time is that people would go to meetings and\n\n1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:18.080\n actually discuss ideas and models. Now it's sort of like, it's sort of like demonstration day at\n\n1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:22.000\n the school science fair where everyone's got their thing and some stuff is cooler than others.\n\n1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:29.600\n But, um, I think we're going to see a shift. I'm grateful that we have so many computer scientists\n\n1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:36.400\n and theoreticians and, um, or theorists, I think they call themselves. Um, and somebody tell me\n\n1:57:36.400 --> 1:57:43.440\n what the difference is someday. Um, and you know, psychology and even dare I say philosophy,\n\n1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:46.800\n you know, these things are starting to converge. We, you know, neuroscience that the name\n\n1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:50.880\n neuroscience, there wasn't even such a thing when I started graduate school or as a postdoc,\n\n1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:56.160\n it was neurophysiology or you were a neuro anatomist or what now every it's sort of\n\n1:57:56.160 --> 1:58:00.480\n everybody's invited and that's beautiful. That means that something's useful is going to come\n\n1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:04.800\n of all this. And there's also tremendous work of course happening on it for the treatment of disease\n\n1:58:04.800 --> 1:58:08.560\n and we shouldn't overlook that. That's where, you know, endings, you know, eliminating,\n\n1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:13.200\n reducing suffering is also a huge initiative in neuroscience. So there's a lot of beauty in the\n\n1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:20.560\n field, but the consciousness thing continues to be a, uh, it's like an exotic bird. It's like,\n\n1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:24.160\n no one really quite knows how to handle it and it dies very easily.\n\n1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:36.480\n Well, yeah, I think also from the AI perspective, I, uh, so I view the brain as less sacred. Uh,\n\n1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:42.160\n I think from a neuroscience perspective, you're a little bit more sensitive to BS,\n\n1:58:42.880 --> 1:58:49.840\n like BS narratives about the brain or whatever. I'm a little bit more, uh, comfortable with just\n\n1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:54.960\n poetic BS about the brain as long as it helps engineer intelligence systems. Well, you know\n\n1:58:54.960 --> 1:59:00.400\n what I mean? Well, and I have to, you know, I confess, um, ignorance when it comes to,\n\n1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:04.000\n you know, most things about coding and I'm, I'm have some quantitative ability,\n\n1:59:04.000 --> 1:59:09.600\n but I don't have strong quantitative leanings. And so I know my limitations too. And so I,\n\n1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:13.360\n I think the next generation coming up, you know, a lot of the students at Stanford are really\n\n1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:20.160\n interested in quantitative models and theory and AI. And I remember when I was coming up, um,\n\n1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:23.440\n a lot of the people who were doing work ahead of me, I kind of rolled my eyes at some of the stuff\n\n1:59:23.440 --> 1:59:27.200\n they were doing, um, including some of their personalities, although I have many great,\n\n1:59:27.200 --> 1:59:32.000\n um, senior colleagues, uh, everywhere in the world. So it's the way of the world. So nobody\n\n1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:36.560\n knows what it's like to be a, you know, a young graduate student in 2020, except the young graduate\n\n1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:42.320\n students. So I, I know what I, I'm, I know there are a lot of things I don't know. And, um, in\n\n1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:45.360\n addition to wanting to do a lot of public education, increased scientific literacy and\n\n1:59:45.360 --> 1:59:51.680\n neuroscientific thinking, et cetera, a big goal of mine is to try and at least pave the way so that\n\n1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:56.160\n these really brilliant and forward thinking, um, younger scientists can make the biggest\n\n1:59:56.160 --> 2:00:01.680\n possible dent and make what will eventually be all us old guys and gals look stupid. I mean,\n\n2:00:01.680 --> 2:00:05.440\n that's, that's what we were all trying to do. That's what we were trying to do. So yeah.\n\n2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:14.560\n Yeah. So from the highest possible topic of consciousness to the, to the lowest level,\n\n2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:18.880\n uh, topic of David Goggins, uh, let's go.\n\n2:00:18.880 --> 2:00:22.480\n I don't know if it's low, low level. He's high performance.\n\n2:00:22.480 --> 2:00:30.480\n High performance, but like low, like there's no, I don't think David has any time for philosophy.\n\n2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:32.560\n Let's just put it this way. Uh,\n\n2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:36.160\n well, it's, I mean, I think we can tack it to what we were just saying in a, in a,\n\n2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:42.720\n in a meaningful way, which is whatever goes on in that abstraction part of the brain,\n\n2:00:43.280 --> 2:00:48.880\n he's figured, you know, he's figured out how to dig down in whatever the limbic friction.\n\n2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:49.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:00:49.440 --> 2:00:51.680\n He's figured out how to grab ahold of that,\n\n2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:59.280\n scruff it and send it in the direction that he's decided it needs to go. And what's wild is that\n\n2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:04.720\n he's, what we're talking about is him doing that to himself, right? He's, it's like he's scruffing\n\n2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:11.920\n himself and directing himself in a particular direction and sending himself down that trajectory.\n\n2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:19.280\n And he, what's beautiful is that he acknowledges that that process is not pretty. It doesn't feel\n\n2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:27.120\n good. It's kind of horrible at every level, but he's created this rewarding element to it. And I\n\n2:01:27.120 --> 2:01:33.120\n think that's, what's so it, it's so admirable. And it's what so many people crave, which is\n\n2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:36.000\n regulation of the self at that level.\n\n2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:43.440\n And he practices, I mean, there's a ritual to it. There's a, every single day, like no exceptions.\n\n2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:48.960\n There's a practice aspect to the suffering that he goes through.\n\n2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:50.800\n It's principled suffering.\n\n2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:51.760\n Principled suffering.\n\n2:01:51.760 --> 2:01:52.400\n It is.\n\n2:01:52.400 --> 2:01:58.160\n I mean, I just, I mean, I admire all aspects of it, including him and his girlfriend slash wife.\n\n2:01:58.160 --> 2:01:59.520\n I'm not sure. She'll probably know this.\n\n2:01:59.520 --> 2:01:59.760\n I don't know.\n\n2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:00.640\n Fiance.\n\n2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:01.360\n Wonderful person.\n\n2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:02.000\n I'm not asking him.\n\n2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:07.760\n No, no. We've only communicated, I've only communicated with her by text about some stuff\n\n2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:13.520\n I was asking David, but yeah, they clearly formed a powerful team.\n\n2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:18.800\n And it's a beautiful thing to see people working in that kind of synergy.\n\n2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:23.840\n And it's inspiring to me, same as with Elon, that a guy like David Goggins can find love.\n\n2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:30.960\n That you find a thing that works, which gives me hope that like whatever,\n\n2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:37.440\n whatever flavor of crazy I am, you can always find another thing that works with that.\n\n2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:44.480\n But I, I've had the, so maybe let's trade Goggins stories.\n\n2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:50.720\n Uh, you from a neuroscience perspective, me from a, uh, self inflicted pain perspective,\n\n2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:59.360\n I somehow found myself in communication with David about some challenges that I was undergoing.\n\n2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:05.760\n One of which is we were communicating every single day, email, phone,\n\n2:03:06.480 --> 2:03:09.120\n about a particular 30 day challenge that I did.\n\n2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:12.800\n That stretched for longer of, uh, pushups and pullups.\n\n2:03:12.800 --> 2:03:14.960\n And you made a call out on social media.\n\n2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:16.080\n Yeah. Social media was dumb.\n\n2:03:16.080 --> 2:03:19.600\n Actually, I think that was the point I, I knew of you before,\n\n2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:22.960\n but that's where I started tracking some of what you were doing with these physical challenges.\n\n2:03:22.960 --> 2:03:28.480\n And I, um, well, no, I think I actually, I don't often comment on people's stuff,\n\n2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:33.680\n but I think I commented something like, uh, neuroplasticity loves a nonnegotiable rule.\n\n2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:40.080\n No, I said a nonnegotiable contract because at the point where neuroplasticity really loves a\n\n2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:45.520\n nonnegotiable contract, because, you know, and I've said this before, so forgive me,\n\n2:03:45.520 --> 2:03:49.360\n but you know, the brain is doing analysis of duration, path and outcome.\n\n2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:54.000\n And that's a lot of work for the brain. And the more that it can pass off duration,\n\n2:03:54.000 --> 2:04:00.240\n path and outcome to just reflex, the more energy and it can allocate to other things.\n\n2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:06.160\n So if you decide there's no negotiation about how many pushups, how far I'm going to run,\n\n2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:10.480\n how many days, how many pullups, et cetera, you actually have more energy for pushups,\n\n2:04:10.480 --> 2:04:11.520\n running and pullups.\n\n2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:15.520\n And when you say neuroplasticity, you mean like the brain, once the decision is made,\n\n2:04:15.520 --> 2:04:20.640\n it'll start rewiring stuff to, to make sure that this, we can actually make this happen.\n\n2:04:20.640 --> 2:04:23.840\n That's right. I mean, so much of what we do is reflexive at the level of just\n\n2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:27.440\n core circuitry, breathing, heart rate, all that, that boring stuff, digestion.\n\n2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:31.760\n But then there's a lot of reflexive stuff, like how you drink out of a mug of coffee\n\n2:04:31.760 --> 2:04:35.920\n that's reflexive too, but that you had to learn at some point in your life earlier\n\n2:04:35.920 --> 2:04:38.720\n when you were very little, analyzing duration, path and outcome.\n\n2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:42.240\n And that involves a lot of top down processing with the prefrontal cortex,\n\n2:04:42.240 --> 2:04:47.120\n but through plasticity mechanisms, you now do it. So when you take on a challenge,\n\n2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:52.080\n provided that you understand the core mechanics of how to run pushups and pullups and whatever\n\n2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:56.960\n else you decided to do, once you set the number and the duration and all that,\n\n2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:03.120\n then you, all you have to do is just go, but people get caught in that tide pool of just,\n\n2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:06.400\n well, do I really have to do it? How do I not do that? What if I get injured? What if I,\n\n2:05:06.400 --> 2:05:12.400\n you know, can I sneak a this or that, you know? And that's work. And to some extent,\n\n2:05:12.400 --> 2:05:19.120\n I look, I not David Goggins, obviously, nor, nor do I claim to understand his process\n\n2:05:20.480 --> 2:05:26.000\n partially, you know, but maybe a little bit, which is that it's clear that by making the decision,\n\n2:05:26.800 --> 2:05:30.560\n there's more resources to devote to the effort of the actual execution.\n\n2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:35.600\n Well, that's a really, like what you're saying was not a lesson that was obvious to me. And\n\n2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:40.080\n it's still not obvious. It's something I really work at, which is there is always an option to\n\n2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:47.680\n quit. And I mean, that's something I really struggle with. I mean, I've quit some things\n\n2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:57.920\n in my life, sick, stupid stuff. And, uh, one lesson I've learned is if you quit once,\n\n2:05:57.920 --> 2:06:06.080\n it opens the door that like, it's really valuable to trick your brain into thinking\n\n2:06:07.760 --> 2:06:12.880\n that you're, you're going to have to die before you quit. Like it's actually really convenient.\n\n2:06:12.880 --> 2:06:19.760\n So actually what you're saying is very profound, but you shouldn't intellectualize it. Like\n\n2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:27.520\n it took me time to develop like psychologically in ways that I think it would be another\n\n2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:32.960\n conversation, cause I'm not sure how to put it into words, but it's really tough on me to, uh,\n\n2:06:32.960 --> 2:06:38.320\n to do certain parts of that challenge, which is a huge, you know, is a huge output. The number,\n\n2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:42.560\n the number that I was, I thought it would be, the number would be hard, but it's not. It's\n\n2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:52.640\n the entirety of it. Uh, especially in the early days was just spending a kind of embarrassed to\n\n2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:58.320\n say how many hours this took. So I didn't say publicly how many hours, cause people,\n\n2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:03.200\n I knew people would be like, don't you, aren't you supposed to do other stuff?\n\n2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:08.320\n Well, it's, um, again, I don't want to speculate too much, but occasionally David has said this\n\n2:07:08.320 --> 2:07:13.200\n publicly where people will be like, don't you sleep or something. And his process used to just\n\n2:07:13.200 --> 2:07:18.880\n be that he would just block delete, you know, like gone, but it's, it's actually, um, it's,\n\n2:07:18.880 --> 2:07:26.480\n it's a super interesting topic. And because self control and directing our actions and the role of\n\n2:07:26.480 --> 2:07:32.320\n emotion and quitting, these are, these are vital to the human experience and they're vital to\n\n2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:37.280\n performing well at anything. And at a high, obviously at a super high level, being able to\n\n2:07:37.280 --> 2:07:44.000\n understand this about the self is crucial. Um, so I have a friend who was also in the teams.\n\n2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:49.840\n His name is Pat Dossett. He did nine years in the seal teams. Um, and in a similar way,\n\n2:07:49.840 --> 2:07:55.840\n there's, there's a lore about him among team guys, um, because of a kind of funny challenge he gave\n\n2:07:55.840 --> 2:08:00.960\n himself, which was, so he and I swim together, although he swims for a long time. Um, and he\n\n2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:05.840\n doesn't swim together, although he swims further up front than I do. Um, and he's very patient. Um,\n\n2:08:06.880 --> 2:08:13.440\n but you know, he was on a, uh, he was assigned when he was in the teams to a position that gave\n\n2:08:13.440 --> 2:08:17.360\n him a little more time behind a desk than he wanted. And it's not as much time out out and\n\n2:08:17.360 --> 2:08:21.760\n deployments, although he did deployments. Um, so he didn't know what to do at that time,\n\n2:08:21.760 --> 2:08:26.160\n but he thought about it and he asked himself, what, what does he hate the most? And it turns\n\n2:08:26.160 --> 2:08:30.080\n out the thing that he hated doing the most was bear crawls, you know, walking on your hands and\n\n2:08:30.080 --> 2:08:34.400\n so he decided to bear crawl for a mile for time. So he was bear crawling a mile a day.\n\n2:08:34.400 --> 2:08:38.960\n Right. And I thought that was an interesting example that he gave because, you know, like\n\n2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:44.080\n why pick the thing you hate the most? And I think it maps right back to limbic friction.\n\n2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:48.640\n It's the thing that creates the most limbic friction. And so if you can overcome that,\n\n2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:53.200\n then there's carry over. And I think the notion of carry over has been talked about psychologically\n\n2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:56.560\n and in kind of in the self help space, like, Oh, if you run a marathon, it's going to help you in\n\n2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:00.880\n other areas of life, but will it really will it? Well, I think it depends on whether or not there's\n\n2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:07.120\n a lot of limbic friction because if there is what you're exercising is not a circuit for bear crawls\n\n2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:11.680\n or a circuit for pull ups. What you're doing is you're exercising a circuit for top down control\n\n2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:16.880\n and that circuit was not designed to be for bear crawls or pull ups or coding\n\n2:09:17.920 --> 2:09:22.320\n or waking up in the middle of the night to do something hard. That circuit was designed to\n\n2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:28.640\n override limbic friction. And so neural circuits were designed to generalize, right? The stress\n\n2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:34.400\n response to an incoming threat that's a physical threat was designed to feel the same way and be\n\n2:09:34.400 --> 2:09:40.720\n the same response internally as the threat to an impending exam or divorce or marriage or whatever\n\n2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:46.640\n it is that's stressing somebody out. And so neural circuits are not designed to be for one particular\n\n2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:52.640\n action or purpose. So if you can, as you did, if you can train up top down control under conditions\n\n2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:58.640\n of the highest limbic friction that when the desire to quit is at its utmost, either because\n\n2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:05.520\n of fatigue or hyper arousal, being too stressed or too tired, you're learning how to engage a\n\n2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:12.400\n circuit and that circuit is forever with you. And if you don't engage it, it sits there, but it's\n\n2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:17.840\n atrophied. It's like a plant that doesn't get any water. And a lot of this has been discussed in\n\n2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:23.040\n self help and growth mindset and all these kinds of ideas that circle the internet and social media.\n\n2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:26.800\n But when you start to think about how they map to neural circuits, I think there's some utility\n\n2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:31.920\n because what it means is that the limbic friction that you'll experience in, I don't know, maybe\n\n2:10:31.920 --> 2:10:38.880\n some future relationship to something or someone, it's a category of neural processing that should\n\n2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:43.680\n immediately click into place. It's just like the limbic friction you experienced trying to engage\n\n2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:49.520\n in the God knows how many pushups, pull ups and running runs you were doing.\n\n2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:52.000\n 25,000. Who's counting?\n\n2:10:52.000 --> 2:11:00.080\n So folks, if Lex does this again, more comments, more likes. This is the problem with you getting\n\n2:11:00.080 --> 2:11:04.000\n more followers is you're going to get more. Actually, I should say that's the benefit.\n\n2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:07.680\n I don't know. Maybe it's not politically correct for me to ask, but there is this\n\n2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:17.760\n a stereotype about Russians being like being really durable. And I started going to that\n\n2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:25.760\n Russian banya that way back before COVID and they could tolerate a lot of heat and they would sit\n\n2:11:25.760 --> 2:11:29.840\n very stoic. No one was going, oh, it's hot in here. They're just kind of like ease into it.\n\n2:11:30.800 --> 2:11:32.320\n So maybe there's something there, who knows?\n\n2:11:32.320 --> 2:11:37.600\n Might be something there, but it could be also just personal. I just have some, I found myself,\n\n2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:45.360\n everyone's different, but I've found myself to be able to do something unpleasant for very long\n\n2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:52.320\n periods of time. Like I'm able to shut off the mind and I don't think that's been fully tested.\n\n2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:55.040\n Monkey mind or the supercomputer?\n\n2:11:55.040 --> 2:12:02.720\n Well, it's interesting. I mean, which mind tells you to quit exactly?\n\n2:12:02.720 --> 2:12:05.120\n Limbic. Limbic friction tells you.\n\n2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:09.120\n Well, limbic friction is the source of that, but who are you talking with exactly?\n\n2:12:09.120 --> 2:12:13.520\n So there's a, we can put something very concrete to that. So there's a\n\n2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:21.280\n paper published in Cell, super top tier journal, two years ago, looking at effort.\n\n2:12:21.280 --> 2:12:26.640\n And this was in a visual environment of trying to swim forward toward a target and a reward.\n\n2:12:26.640 --> 2:12:31.360\n And it was a really cool experiment because they manipulated virtually the visual environment. So\n\n2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:36.480\n the same amount of effort was being expended every time. But sometimes the perception was\n\n2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:40.400\n you're making forward progress. And sometimes the perception was you're making no progress\n\n2:12:40.400 --> 2:12:44.800\n because stuff wasn't drifting by meant no progress. So you can be swimming and swimming\n\n2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:52.720\n and swimming and not making progress. And it turns out that with each bout of effort, there's epinephrine\n\n2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:58.800\n and norepinephrine is being released in the brainstem and glia, what traditionally were\n\n2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:02.000\n thought of as support cells for the neurons, but they do a lot of things actively too,\n\n2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:06.720\n are measuring the amount of epinephrine and norepinephrine in that circuit.\n\n2:13:06.720 --> 2:13:11.200\n And when it exceeds a certain threshold, the glia send inhibitory signals that shut down\n\n2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:17.600\n top down control. They literally it's the quit. You stop. There's no more. It's you quit enduring.\n\n2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:28.560\n It can be rescued. Endurance can be rescued with dopamine. So that's where the subjective part\n\n2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:34.800\n really comes into play. So you quit because you've learned how to turn that off or you've\n\n2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:41.360\n learned how to, some people will reward the pain process so much that friction becomes the reward.\n\n2:13:41.360 --> 2:13:46.320\n And when you talk about people like Goggins and other people I know from special operations and\n\n2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:52.240\n people have gone through cancer treatments three times, you hear about, just when you hear about\n\n2:13:52.240 --> 2:13:56.400\n people, the Viktor Frankl stories, I mean, you hear about Nelson Mandela, you hear about these\n\n2:13:56.400 --> 2:14:01.520\n stories. I'm sure the same process is involved. Again, this speaks to the generalizability of\n\n2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:06.320\n these processes as opposed to a neural circuit for a particular action or cognitive function.\n\n2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:12.320\n So I think you have to learn to subjectively self reward in a way that replenishes you.\n\n2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:19.840\n Goggins talks about eating souls. It's a very dramatic example in his mind, apparently that's\n\n2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:26.240\n a form of reward, but it's not just a form of reward where it's like you're picking up a trophy\n\n2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:33.440\n or something. It's actually, it gives you energy. It's a reward that gives more neural energy. And\n\n2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:39.120\n I'm defining that as more dopamine to suppress the noradrenaline adrenaline circuits in the\n\n2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:45.280\n brainstem. So ultimately maps to that. Yeah. He creates enemies. He's always fighting enemies.\n\n2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:51.440\n I never, I think I have enemies, but there are usually just versions of me inside my head. So\n\n2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:57.920\n I thought about through that 30 day challenge, I tried to come up with like fake enemies. It wasn't\n\n2:14:57.920 --> 2:15:06.320\n working. The only enemy I came up with is David. Well, now you have a, you certainly have a form\n\n2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.320\n formidable adversary in this one. I don't care. I'm David. I'm willing to die on this one. So let's\n\n2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:22.400\n go there. Well, let's hope you both survive this one. My problem is the physical. So everything\n\n2:15:22.400 --> 2:15:27.920\n we've been talking about in the mind, there's a physical aspect that's just practically difficult,\n\n2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:33.920\n which is like, I can't like, you know, when you injure yourself at a certain point, like you just\n\n2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:39.120\n can't function or you're doing more damage. Yeah. Talking about it, taking yourself out of running\n\n2:15:39.120 --> 2:15:45.920\n for the rest of your life potentially, or like, you know, or did it for years. So, you know,\n\n2:15:45.920 --> 2:15:52.400\n I'd love to avoid that, right? There's just like stupid physical stuff that you just want to avoid.\n\n2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.760\n You want to keep it purely in the mental. And if it's purely in the mental, that's when the race\n\n2:15:57.760 --> 2:16:03.360\n is interesting. But yeah, the problem with these physical challenges as David has experienced,\n\n2:16:03.360 --> 2:16:09.520\n I mean, it has a toll on your body. I tend to think of the mind is limitless and the body is\n\n2:16:09.520 --> 2:16:15.840\n kind of unfortunately quite limited. Well, I think the key is to dynamically control your output.\n\n2:16:15.840 --> 2:16:22.160\n And that can be done by reducing effort, which doesn't work for throughout, but also by\n\n2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:30.240\n restoring through these subjective reward processes. And we don't want to go down the\n\n2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:34.320\n rabbit hole of why this all works, but these are ancient pathways that were designed to\n\n2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:40.640\n bring resources to an animal or to a person through foraging for hunting or mates or water,\n\n2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:46.320\n all these things. And they work so well because they're down in those circuits where we know the\n\n2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:52.480\n zeros and ones. And that's great because it can be subjective at the level of, oh, I reached this\n\n2:16:52.480 --> 2:17:00.320\n one milestone, this one horizon, this one three meter target. But if you don't reward it, it's\n\n2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:07.680\n just effort. If you do self reward it, it's effort minus one in terms of the adrenaline output.\n\n2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:16.640\n I have to ask you about this. You're one of the great communicators in science. I'm really a big\n\n2:17:16.640 --> 2:17:21.920\n fan of yours, enjoying in terms of the educational stuff you're putting on neuroscience.\n\n2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:23.280\n Thank you.\n\n2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:29.120\n What's the, do you have a philosophy behind it or is it just an instinct,\n\n2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:35.840\n unstoppable force? Do you have, like, what's your thinking? Because it's rare and it's exciting.\n\n2:17:36.640 --> 2:17:45.600\n I'm excited that, you know, somebody from Stanford. So I, okay, I'm in multiple places\n\n2:17:45.600 --> 2:17:52.000\n in the sense of like where my interests lie. And one, you know, politically speaking, academic\n\n2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:59.360\n institutions are under fire, you know, for many reasons we don't need to get into. I get into it\n\n2:17:59.360 --> 2:18:10.720\n in a lot of other places, but I believe in places like Stanford and places like MIT as one of the\n\n2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:18.720\n most magical institutions for inspiring people to dream, people to build the future. I mean,\n\n2:18:18.720 --> 2:18:24.720\n it's, I believe that it is a really special, these universities are really special places.\n\n2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:33.440\n And so it's always exciting to me when somebody as inspiring as you represents those places. So\n\n2:18:33.440 --> 2:18:41.280\n it makes me proud that somebody from Stanford is like, somebody like you is representing Stanford.\n\n2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:51.680\n So maybe you could speak to what's, how did you come to be who you are in being a communicator?\n\n2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:58.000\n Well, first of all, thanks for the kind words, especially coming from you. I think Stanford is\n\n2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:04.800\n an amazing place as is MIT and it's such a. MIT is better by the way. I'll let it out. Anything\n\n2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:10.880\n you say at this point. I have many friends at MIT. Yeah. Smarter friends. Yeah. Ed Boyden is\n\n2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:19.280\n among the best in class. There's some people, not me that can hold a candle to him, but not many,\n\n2:19:19.280 --> 2:19:25.840\n maybe one or two. I think the great benefit of being in a place like MIT or Stanford is that\n\n2:19:25.840 --> 2:19:34.080\n when you look around, the average is very high. You have many best in class among the one or two\n\n2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:40.160\n or three best in the world at what they do. And it's a wonderful privilege to be there. And one\n\n2:19:40.160 --> 2:19:44.880\n thing that I think also makes them and other universities like them very special is that\n\n2:19:44.880 --> 2:19:50.480\n there's an emphasis on what gets exported out of the university, not keeping it ivory tower and\n\n2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:55.600\n really trying to keep an eye on what's needed in the world and trying to do something useful.\n\n2:19:55.600 --> 2:20:01.200\n And I think the proximity to industry and Silicon Valley and in the Boston area and Cambridge also\n\n2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:07.200\n lends itself well to that. And there are other institutions too, of course. So the reason I got\n\n2:20:07.200 --> 2:20:15.360\n involved in educating on social media was actually because of Pat Dossett, the mile bear call guy.\n\n2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:22.640\n It was at the turn of 2018 to 2019. We had formed a good friendship and he talked me into doing these\n\n2:20:22.640 --> 2:20:27.520\n early morning cold water swims. I was learning a lot about pain and suffering, but also the beauty\n\n2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:32.640\n of cold water swims. And we were talking one morning and he said, so what are you going to\n\n2:20:32.640 --> 2:20:37.760\n do to serve the world in 2019? It's like, that's the way that like a Texan former seal talks.\n\n2:20:37.760 --> 2:20:40.640\n Like we're just literally like, what are you going to do to serve the world in 2019?\n\n2:20:40.640 --> 2:20:43.680\n Like, well, I've run my lab. It's like, no, no, what are you going to do? That's new.\n\n2:20:43.680 --> 2:20:46.640\n And he wasn't forceful in it, but I was like, that's interesting question. I said, well,\n\n2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:52.320\n if I had my way, I would just teach people, everyone about the brain. Because I think\n\n2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:56.880\n it's amazing. He goes, we'll do it. I go, all right. He goes, shake on it. So we did it, you\n\n2:20:56.880 --> 2:21:03.520\n know? And so I started putting out these posts and it's grown into, to include a variety of things,\n\n2:21:04.080 --> 2:21:10.000\n but you asked about a governing philosophy. So I want to increase interest in the brain and in the\n\n2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:15.200\n nervous system and in biology generally, that's one major goal. I'd like to increase scientific\n\n2:21:15.200 --> 2:21:21.440\n literacy, which can't be rammed down people's throats of talking about how to look at a graph\n\n2:21:21.440 --> 2:21:27.440\n and statistics and Z scores and P values and genetics. It has to be done gradually, in my\n\n2:21:27.440 --> 2:21:34.320\n opinion. I want to put valuable tools into the world, mainly tools that map to things that we're\n\n2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:40.400\n doing in our lab. So these will be tools centered around how to understand and direct one's states\n\n2:21:40.400 --> 2:21:45.520\n of mind and body. So reduce stress, raise one's stress threshold. So it's not always just about\n\n2:21:45.520 --> 2:21:51.760\n being calm. Sometimes it's about learning how to tolerate being not calm, raise awareness for\n\n2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:58.560\n mental health. There's a ton of micro missions in this, but it all really maps back to, you know,\n\n2:21:58.560 --> 2:22:02.960\n like the eight and 10 year old version of me, which is I used to spend my weekends when I was\n\n2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:07.840\n a kid reading about weird animals. And I had this obsession with like medieval weapons and stuff\n\n2:22:07.840 --> 2:22:12.720\n like catapults. And then I used to come into school on Monday and I would ask if I could talk\n\n2:22:12.720 --> 2:22:18.320\n about it to the class and teach. And I just, it's really, I promise, and some people might\n\n2:22:18.320 --> 2:22:23.040\n not believe me, but it's really, I don't really like being the point of focus. I just get so\n\n2:22:23.040 --> 2:22:30.080\n excited about these gems of that I find in the world in books and in experiments and in\n\n2:22:30.080 --> 2:22:34.960\n discussions with colleagues and discussions with people like you and around the universe.\n\n2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:39.680\n And I can't just compulsively, I got to tell people about it. So I try and package it into\n\n2:22:39.680 --> 2:22:44.480\n a form that people can access. You know, I think if I've, I think the reception has been really\n\n2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:51.040\n wonderful. Stanford has been very supportive, thankfully. I've done some podcasts even with\n\n2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:55.760\n them and they've reposted some stuff on social media. It's a precarious place to put yourself\n\n2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:00.320\n out there as a research academic. I think some of my colleagues, both locally and elsewhere,\n\n2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:05.680\n probably wonder if I'm still serious about research, which I absolutely am. And I also\n\n2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:13.200\n acknowledge that their research and the research coming out of the field needs to be talked about\n\n2:23:13.200 --> 2:23:18.240\n and not all scientists are good at translating that into a language that people can access.\n\n2:23:18.880 --> 2:23:25.520\n And I don't like the phrase dumb it down. What I like to do is take a concept that I think people\n\n2:23:25.520 --> 2:23:32.000\n will find interesting and useful and offer it sort of like you would offer food to somebody visiting\n\n2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:36.480\n your home. You're not going to cram foie gras in their face. You're going to say, like, do you want\n\n2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:40.240\n a cracker? And they say, yeah. And like, do you want something on that cracker? Like, do you like\n\n2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:45.120\n cheese? Like, yeah. Like, do you want Swiss cheese or you want that really like stinky, like French?\n\n2:23:45.120 --> 2:23:50.320\n I don't like cheese much. Or do you want foie gras? Like, what's that? Like, so you're trying,\n\n2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:55.760\n the best information prompts more questions of interest, not questions of confusion,\n\n2:23:55.760 --> 2:23:59.920\n but questions of interest. And so I feel like one door opens, then another door opens,\n\n2:23:59.920 --> 2:24:04.880\n then another door opens. And pretty soon, the image in my mind is you create a bunch of\n\n2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:09.280\n neuroscientists who are thinking about themselves neuroscientifically. And I don't begin to think\n\n2:24:09.280 --> 2:24:15.360\n that I have all the answers at all. I cast a neuroscience, sometimes a little bit of a psychology\n\n2:24:15.360 --> 2:24:23.920\n lens onto what I think are interesting topics. And someday I'm going to go into the ground or\n\n2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:31.520\n the ocean or wherever it is I end up. And I'm very comfortable with the fact that not everyone's\n\n2:24:31.520 --> 2:24:34.960\n going to be happy with how I deliver the information, but I would hope that people\n\n2:24:34.960 --> 2:24:39.200\n would feel like some of it was useful and meaningful and got them to think a little bit\n\n2:24:39.200 --> 2:24:48.560\n harder. Since you mentioned going into the ground and Victor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning,\n\n2:24:48.560 --> 2:25:02.000\n I reread that book quite often. Let me ask the big ridiculous question about life. What do you\n\n2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:08.800\n think is the meaning of it all? And maybe why do you, do you mention that book from a psychologist\n\n2:25:08.800 --> 2:25:16.800\n perspective, which Victor Frankl was, or do you ever think about the bigger philosophical questions\n\n2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:24.800\n that raises about meaning? What's the meaning of it all? One of the great challenges in assigning a\n\n2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:29.680\n good, you know, giving a good answer to the question of like, what's the meaning of life is,\n\n2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:35.600\n um, I think illustrated best by the Victor Frankl example, although there are other examples too,\n\n2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:43.120\n which is that our sense of meaning is very elastic in time and space. And I'm, I'm,\n\n2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:49.280\n uh, we talked a little bit about this earlier, but it's amazing to me that somebody locked in a cell\n\n2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:56.400\n or a concentration camp can bring the horizon in close enough that they can then micro slice their\n\n2:25:56.400 --> 2:26:03.280\n environment so that they can find rewards and meaning and power and beauty, even in a little\n\n2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:09.440\n square box or, or a horrible situation. And I think this is really speaks to one of the most\n\n2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:14.880\n important features of the human mind, which is we could do, let's take two opposite extremes.\n\n2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:19.360\n One would be, let's say the alarm went off right now in this building and the building started\n\n2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:26.960\n shaking our vision, our hearing, everything would be tuned to this space, time bubble for those\n\n2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:32.640\n moments and everything that we were processed, all that would matter. The only meaning would be\n\n2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:36.160\n get out of here, safe, figure out what's going on, contact loved ones, et cetera.\n\n2:26:36.160 --> 2:26:40.080\n If we were to sit back, totally relaxed, we could do the, you know, I think it's called pale blue\n\n2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:43.360\n dot thing or whatever, where we could imagine ourselves in this room. And then they were in\n\n2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:47.360\n the United States and this continent and the earth, and then it's peering down us. And all of\n\n2:26:47.360 --> 2:26:53.040\n a sudden you get back, it can seem so big that all of a sudden it's meaningless, right? If you\n\n2:26:53.040 --> 2:27:00.880\n see yourself as just one brief glimmer in all of time and all of space, you go to, I don't matter.\n\n2:27:00.880 --> 2:27:06.240\n And if you go to, oh, every little thing that happens in this text thread or this, you know,\n\n2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:12.400\n comment section on YouTube or Instagram, your space time bubble is tiny, then everything seems\n\n2:27:12.400 --> 2:27:22.560\n inflated and the brain will contract and dilate its space, time, vision and time, but also sense\n\n2:27:22.560 --> 2:27:28.000\n of meaning. And that's beautiful. And it's what allows us to be so dynamic in different environments\n\n2:27:28.000 --> 2:27:33.360\n and we can pull from the past and the present and future. It's why examples like Nelson Mandela and\n\n2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:39.280\n Viktor Frankl had to include, it makes sense that it wasn't just about grinding it out. They had to\n\n2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:46.640\n find those dopamine rewards, even in those little boxes they were forced into. So I'm not trying to\n\n2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:54.640\n dodge an answer, but for me personally, and I think about this a lot because I have this complicated\n\n2:27:54.640 --> 2:28:00.160\n history in science where my undergraduate, graduate advisor and postdoctoral advisor all died young.\n\n2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:07.920\n So, you know, and they were wonderful people and had immense importance in my life. But what I\n\n2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:15.040\n realized is that we can get so fixated on the thing that we're experiencing, holding tremendous\n\n2:28:15.040 --> 2:28:21.440\n meaning, but it only holds that meaning for as long as we're in that space, time regime.\n\n2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:28.080\n And this is important because what really gives meaning is the understanding that you can move\n\n2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.400\n between these different space, time dimensionalities. And I'm not trying to sound like a\n\n2:28:32.400 --> 2:28:39.040\n theoretical physicist or anyone that thinks about the cosmos and saying that it's really the fact\n\n2:28:39.040 --> 2:28:44.880\n that sometimes we'd say and do and think things and it feels so important. And then two days later,\n\n2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:51.680\n like what happened? Well, you had a different brain processing algorithm entirely. You were in a\n\n2:28:51.680 --> 2:28:59.680\n completely different state. And so what I want to do in this lifetime is I want to engage in as many\n\n2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:07.120\n different levels of contraction and dilation of meaning as possible. I want to go to the micro.\n\n2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:10.480\n I sometimes think about this. I'm like, if I just pulled over the side of the road, I bet you there's\n\n2:29:10.480 --> 2:29:15.760\n an anthill there and their whole world is fascinating. You can't stay there. And you also\n\n2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:20.240\n can't stay staring up at the clouds and just think about how we're just these little beings and it\n\n2:29:20.240 --> 2:29:27.520\n doesn't matter. The key is the journey back and forth, up and down that staircase, back and forth\n\n2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:32.240\n and back and forth. And my goal is to get as many trips up and down that staircase as I can before\n\n2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:36.960\n the reaper comes for me. Oh, beautiful. So the, the, the dance of dilation of meaning,\n\n2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:44.240\n contraction between the different space, zoom in, zoom out, and get as many steps in on that\n\n2:29:44.240 --> 2:29:50.160\n staircase. That's, that's my goal anyway. And I've watched people die. I watched my postdoc advisor\n\n2:29:50.160 --> 2:29:56.080\n die wither away. My graduate, it was tragic, but they found beauty in these closing moments\n\n2:29:56.080 --> 2:30:03.040\n because their bubble was their kids in one case, or like one of them was a Giants fan and like got\n\n2:30:03.040 --> 2:30:08.400\n to see a Giants game, you know, in her last moments and like, and you just realize like it's a Giants\n\n2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:13.040\n game, but not in that moment because time is closing. And so those time bins feel huge because\n\n2:30:13.040 --> 2:30:20.400\n she's slicing things so differently. So I think, um, learning how to do that better and more fluidly,\n\n2:30:20.400 --> 2:30:27.280\n recognizing where one is and not getting too taxed to the idea that there's one correct answer,\n\n2:30:27.280 --> 2:30:33.200\n like that's what brings meaning. That's my goal anyway. I don't think there's a better way to end\n\n2:30:33.200 --> 2:30:40.400\n it. Andrew, I really appreciate that you would, uh, come down and contract your space time and\n\n2:30:40.400 --> 2:30:47.120\n focus on this conversation for a few hours. Uh, is a huge honor. I'm a huge fan of yours. As I told\n\n2:30:47.120 --> 2:30:53.680\n you, I hope you keep growing and educating the world about the human mind.
