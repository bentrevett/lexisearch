and was recommended highly as a rigorous scholar\n\n00:08.040 --> 00:10.920\n and thinker in the space of decentralized finance\n\n00:10.920 --> 00:12.160\n and Bitcoin.\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:15.200\n His podcast titled What is Money?\n\n00:15.200 --> 00:18.240\n is a good representation of the way his mind works.\n\n00:18.240 --> 00:21.600\n He's willing to talk through ideas for many hours,\n\n00:21.600 --> 00:24.080\n willing to listen, willing to think,\n\n00:24.080 --> 00:26.780\n which makes him a great companion in conversation\n\n00:26.780 --> 00:31.020\n to explore the history, philosophy, and future of money.\n\n00:31.960 --> 00:33.720\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:33.720 --> 00:38.200\n Fundrise, Element, MonkPak, and BetterHelp.\n\n00:38.200 --> 00:41.780\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:41.780 --> 00:43.920\n As a side note, let me say that I'll have\n\n00:43.920 --> 00:46.000\n a number of conversations in the coming months\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.320\n on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n00:49.320 --> 00:52.280\n None of these conversations are financial advice.\n\n00:52.280 --> 00:54.800\n That's not a legal warning, that's a genuine description\n\n00:54.800 --> 00:57.500\n of my goals and approach with these chats.\n\n00:57.500 --> 01:00.560\n At least for a while, I personally won't actively invest\n\n01:00.560 --> 01:03.360\n in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies,\n\n01:03.360 --> 01:06.480\n except to learn about the technology itself.\n\n01:06.480 --> 01:08.920\n I don't think this should be a journalistic standard\n\n01:08.920 --> 01:11.320\n like the New York Times trying to establish,\n\n01:11.320 --> 01:13.120\n which I very much disagree with.\n\n01:13.120 --> 01:16.660\n In my humble opinion, I think journalists should be free\n\n01:16.660 --> 01:19.240\n to invest in Bitcoin if they want to.\n\n01:19.240 --> 01:21.460\n Luckily, I'm not a journalist.\n\n01:21.460 --> 01:24.560\n I just know my own psychology and I feel that my thinking\n\n01:24.560 --> 01:26.360\n will be muddled by excitement\n\n01:26.360 --> 01:29.000\n if I invest before I understand.\n\n01:29.000 --> 01:31.320\n I feel the same way about Tesla, for example.\n\n01:31.320 --> 01:33.800\n I still don't own any Tesla stock\n\n01:33.800 --> 01:37.340\n and I am still indeed fascinated by Tesla Autopilot\n\n01:37.340 --> 01:39.500\n as an artificial intelligence system.\n\n01:39.500 --> 01:42.600\n I work hard to be cognizant of the biases\n\n01:42.600 --> 01:47.280\n that arise in my mind and always try to choose the path\n\n01:47.280 --> 01:52.040\n that maximizes or maintains a freedom of thought\n\n01:52.040 --> 01:53.720\n as much as possible.\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:56.200\n Also, let me say that I try to be very careful\n\n01:56.200 --> 01:59.440\n in selecting guests based not only on the contents\n\n01:59.440 --> 02:03.000\n of their ideas, but the richness, complexity, music,\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:05.140\n style of their mind and character.\n\n02:05.140 --> 02:08.020\n Yes, I will talk with people with whom you\n\n02:08.020 --> 02:12.080\n and I may disagree, people who some may call bad\n\n02:12.080 --> 02:14.840\n or even evil human beings.\n\n02:14.840 --> 02:18.100\n I want to understand them because I believe that,\n\n02:18.100 --> 02:22.520\n as Solzhenitsyn said, the battle line between good and evil\n\n02:22.520 --> 02:25.140\n runs through the heart of every man.\n\n02:25.140 --> 02:27.040\n I think if you always run from evil,\n\n02:27.040 --> 02:30.440\n you become blind to the truth of human nature.\n\n02:30.440 --> 02:32.800\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast\n\n02:32.800 --> 02:36.340\n and here is my conversation with Robert Breedlove.\n\n02:37.280 --> 02:41.480\n Rousseau opens his 1762 book, The Social Contract,\n\n02:41.480 --> 02:43.380\n with the following statement.\n\n02:43.380 --> 02:47.460\n \"'Man is born free and everywhere he is in chains.'\"\n\n02:47.460 --> 02:50.800\n So you talk about freedom and sovereignty quite a bit.\n\n02:50.800 --> 02:54.640\n What do these ideas mean to you, the idea of sovereignty?\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:57.840\n Freedom and sovereignty, I think they're very\n\n02:57.840 --> 02:59.020\n closely related.\n\n03:00.000 --> 03:01.740\n Let's start just focusing on sovereignty,\n\n03:01.740 --> 03:04.840\n which is a word I don't think we talk about enough.\n\n03:04.840 --> 03:07.120\n And the general definition of that I would give\n\n03:07.120 --> 03:10.100\n is the authority to act as you see fit.\n\n03:12.760 --> 03:15.840\n And it's a word that's etymologically associated\n\n03:15.840 --> 03:19.280\n with words like monarchy, money, reign.\n\n03:19.280 --> 03:23.520\n So historically, it's referred to whatever the locus\n\n03:23.520 --> 03:26.240\n of supreme power is in the sphere of human action.\n\n03:26.240 --> 03:30.120\n So whether, if you go like back into ancient Egypt,\n\n03:30.120 --> 03:32.400\n the Pharaoh had absolute sovereignty\n\n03:32.400 --> 03:34.800\n and everyone else was pretty much operating\n\n03:34.800 --> 03:36.800\n according to his interests.\n\n03:36.800 --> 03:40.200\n You fast forward to today, modern Western democracy,\n\n03:40.200 --> 03:43.360\n we have more decentralized sovereignty\n\n03:43.360 --> 03:45.380\n and that we all get to go vote and elect officials\n\n03:45.380 --> 03:47.700\n that make decisions on our behalf.\n\n03:47.700 --> 03:51.000\n So the theme of sovereignty across history\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:52.760\n is that it's been gradually decentralizing\n\n03:52.760 --> 03:55.400\n across our different models of socioeconomics.\n\n03:56.800 --> 04:01.100\n And it's largely, you could say it's rooted heavily\n\n04:01.100 --> 04:03.080\n in the money, I would argue,\n\n04:03.080 --> 04:04.700\n which is something we'll get a lot into here,\n\n04:04.700 --> 04:08.320\n where if you have money, you have the authority\n\n04:08.320 --> 04:10.040\n to act as you see fit in the world.\n\n04:11.420 --> 04:14.160\n And even in our current political sphere,\n\n04:14.160 --> 04:17.000\n if you have enough money, you can actually reshape the rules.\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:19.200\n You can reshape laws, you can lobby Congress.\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:24.640\n If you're in a certain situation, like many billionaires,\n\n04:24.640 --> 04:26.640\n you can negotiate your own tax treaty\n\n04:26.640 --> 04:28.520\n such that you can get favorable tax treatment\n\n04:28.520 --> 04:30.440\n with certain jurisdictions in the world.\n\n04:30.440 --> 04:35.360\n So this concept of sovereignty, which today we call,\n\n04:35.360 --> 04:39.440\n it's common to call states or nation states\n\n04:39.440 --> 04:41.080\n or government sovereign,\n\n04:41.080 --> 04:43.120\n meaning that they have power over people.\n\n04:44.600 --> 04:46.040\n But as I argue in a lot of my writing,\n\n04:46.040 --> 04:48.000\n I actually think that sovereignty\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:49.960\n and here's within the individual\n\n04:49.960 --> 04:54.720\n and that we each have our own interiorized space of choice,\n\n04:54.720 --> 04:56.120\n which is something like Victor Frankl\n\n04:56.120 --> 04:58.080\n called the final human freedom.\n\n04:58.080 --> 05:00.440\n And that we, no matter what our circumstances are,\n\n05:00.440 --> 05:03.340\n no matter what exogenous situation we face,\n\n05:03.340 --> 05:05.360\n we always have this endogenous power\n\n05:05.360 --> 05:07.640\n to choose how we respond to it.\n\n05:07.640 --> 05:09.280\n That's one of my favorite books is,\n\n05:09.280 --> 05:11.120\n A Man's Search for Meaning.\n\n05:11.120 --> 05:13.360\n Maybe we can break that apart a little bit.\n\n05:13.360 --> 05:16.880\n So you've kind of spoken about sovereignty\n\n05:16.880 --> 05:20.000\n as a closely linked to power,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:22.240\n but is there something about your own mind\n\n05:22.240 --> 05:25.400\n being able to achieve sovereignty\n\n05:25.400 --> 05:27.260\n no matter what the monetary system is,\n\n05:27.260 --> 05:30.240\n no matter what, who has the control over centralized power,\n\n05:30.240 --> 05:34.040\n the money or whatever the mechanisms of sovereignty\n\n05:34.040 --> 05:35.280\n and the societal level?\n\n05:35.280 --> 05:39.200\n You as an individual, isn't ultimately all boiled down\n\n05:39.200 --> 05:42.560\n to what you can do with your mind, how you see the world?\n\n05:42.560 --> 05:43.600\n How you interpret it.\n\n05:43.600 --> 05:45.040\n Yeah, I agree.\n\n05:45.040 --> 05:47.520\n And as we get a little bit deeper into this,\n\n05:47.520 --> 05:48.680\n I think we'll come to see money\n\n05:48.680 --> 05:50.600\n as an extension of your mind.\n\n05:50.600 --> 05:52.560\n So there's a feedback between money and mind.\n\n05:52.560 --> 05:54.840\n For instance, you think in dollars today,\n\n05:54.840 --> 05:57.440\n almost guarantee it, most of us do here in the US.\n\n05:58.960 --> 06:00.200\n And it's a tool, right?\n\n06:00.200 --> 06:03.320\n It's a tool we're using to decomplexify the world around us,\n\n06:03.320 --> 06:08.320\n to deal with it, to understand the sacrifices and successes\n\n06:08.700 --> 06:10.840\n across an entire history of economic transactions.\n\n06:10.840 --> 06:12.400\n We can boil that all down to the price.\n\n06:12.400 --> 06:14.360\n So it's data compression.\n\n06:14.360 --> 06:17.600\n And if you can change,\n\n06:17.600 --> 06:20.800\n if there's a central body or central governance mechanism\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:21.880\n that can manipulate that money,\n\n06:21.880 --> 06:23.640\n it can have an impact on your mind.\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:28.200\n For instance, today, so I agree with you on the first hand,\n\n06:28.200 --> 06:32.140\n say that I do believe in free will.\n\n06:32.140 --> 06:34.860\n I do believe in individual autonomy,\n\n06:34.860 --> 06:39.160\n but I also think that there are certain devices and powers\n\n06:39.160 --> 06:40.000\n in the world around us\n\n06:40.000 --> 06:42.120\n that can actually influence how we think.\n\n06:42.120 --> 06:44.280\n And it's fascinating to think about the fact\n\n06:44.280 --> 06:46.960\n that money might be actually deeply integrated\n\n06:46.960 --> 06:49.680\n into the way we think and into our mind.\n\n06:51.320 --> 06:54.120\n You think about what are the core aspects of the human mind?\n\n06:54.120 --> 06:56.000\n What influences cognition,\n\n06:56.000 --> 06:58.320\n the way you reason about the world?\n\n06:58.320 --> 07:02.080\n You have the Chomsky languages at the core of everything,\n\n07:02.080 --> 07:06.880\n but you're kind of placing money as pretty close\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:08.660\n to the core of what it means\n\n07:08.660 --> 07:11.960\n to be an intelligent reasoning human.\n\n07:11.960 --> 07:14.440\n I think money is a direct derivation\n\n07:14.440 --> 07:16.120\n of action and speech, actually.\n\n07:16.120 --> 07:18.080\n It's another expression of the logos.\n\n07:19.160 --> 07:22.080\n If we even think of what it means to think\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.880\n is that we are generating two different courses of action,\n\n07:26.880 --> 07:28.600\n potential courses of action,\n\n07:28.600 --> 07:31.120\n and we're populating them with avatars, right?\n\n07:31.120 --> 07:32.680\n Maybe ourselves or others.\n\n07:32.680 --> 07:36.000\n And then we're comparing how we may act in each situation\n\n07:36.000 --> 07:37.400\n and what we think the result would be.\n\n07:37.400 --> 07:40.240\n So actually it's comparison.\n\n07:40.240 --> 07:41.880\n Basically it's comparison and contrasting\n\n07:41.880 --> 07:44.260\n of possible courses of action.\n\n07:44.260 --> 07:47.440\n And that's the same thing with words themselves.\n\n07:48.820 --> 07:53.180\n Most words, the vast majority of words\n\n07:53.180 --> 07:55.760\n only have meaning in relationship to other words, right?\n\n07:55.760 --> 07:59.520\n It's all contextual definitions of a word or more words.\n\n07:59.520 --> 08:01.100\n Now people have argued with me about this\n\n08:01.100 --> 08:02.780\n because there is a first word, right?\n\n08:02.780 --> 08:04.920\n Where you pick up rock and say rock.\n\n08:04.920 --> 08:08.300\n But most other words in higher abstraction\n\n08:08.300 --> 08:10.400\n tend to be relative.\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:15.400\n And what's funny about action and speech,\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:18.380\n and this gets, I got into a bit of this in our paper here,\n\n08:18.380 --> 08:21.740\n is that it's linked to evolutionary biology\n\n08:21.740 --> 08:26.400\n and that once human beings adopted upright stance,\n\n08:26.400 --> 08:27.940\n we freed our hands.\n\n08:27.940 --> 08:30.300\n We no longer needed our hands for locomotion.\n\n08:30.300 --> 08:33.040\n So we started to evolve more dexterity\n\n08:34.280 --> 08:35.920\n and notably we have opposable thumbs.\n\n08:35.920 --> 08:38.520\n So this gives us an ability to manipulate\n\n08:38.520 --> 08:39.960\n and particularize the environment\n\n08:39.960 --> 08:42.360\n in a way that most other animals cannot.\n\n08:42.360 --> 08:44.120\n And what's interesting about this is that\n\n08:44.120 --> 08:49.020\n as we gain this ability to manipulate natural resources\n\n08:49.020 --> 08:52.040\n and count, point, pointing was a big deal\n\n08:52.040 --> 08:54.640\n and that we could indicate prey\n\n08:54.640 --> 08:56.600\n or items that are far off distance\n\n08:56.600 --> 08:58.200\n and we could organize ourselves.\n\n09:00.560 --> 09:04.240\n At the same time we co evolved this fine musculature\n\n09:04.240 --> 09:05.960\n in the face and tongue.\n\n09:05.960 --> 09:07.920\n So it's as if speech developed,\n\n09:07.920 --> 09:09.960\n co evolved really with our dexterity.\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:15.840\n And as a natural extension of that came us making tools.\n\n09:17.120 --> 09:18.400\n Right, we started to create things\n\n09:18.400 --> 09:21.280\n to better satisfy our wants over time.\n\n09:21.280 --> 09:24.940\n And the most tradable tool in any society\n\n09:24.940 --> 09:26.680\n or the most tradable thing is money.\n\n09:26.680 --> 09:31.240\n So I really, I argue that action and speech\n\n09:31.240 --> 09:35.280\n are quintessential modes of self sovereign expression.\n\n09:35.280 --> 09:37.300\n And the money is just sort of a tech layer\n\n09:37.300 --> 09:38.920\n we've put right on top of that.\n\n09:38.920 --> 09:42.300\n And that it's a natural derivation of action and speech.\n\n09:42.300 --> 09:44.980\n Okay, that's fascinating to think about sovereignty\n\n09:44.980 --> 09:47.240\n from the evolutionary perspective.\n\n09:47.240 --> 09:50.240\n And then ultimately money is the technology layer\n\n09:50.240 --> 09:52.000\n that enables sovereignty.\n\n09:52.000 --> 09:57.000\n So, you know, it's really fascinating to think about\n\n09:57.360 --> 10:01.120\n our modern human society as deeply rooted\n\n10:01.120 --> 10:03.280\n in these like evolutionary roots\n\n10:03.280 --> 10:05.380\n from the very origins of life on earth.\n\n10:05.380 --> 10:09.780\n So what, you know, some of the ideas you just mentioned,\n\n10:09.780 --> 10:13.080\n what do you see are some interesting characteristics\n\n10:13.080 --> 10:17.140\n of just life on earth that propagated to us humans?\n\n10:18.320 --> 10:20.920\n Like what ideas propagated through,\n\n10:20.920 --> 10:23.540\n have roots in the evolution?\n\n10:23.540 --> 10:28.040\n Yeah, I think one of the deepest impulsions in life\n\n10:28.040 --> 10:29.880\n is the territorial imperative.\n\n10:29.880 --> 10:34.880\n So all life is seeking to expand its dominion\n\n10:35.260 --> 10:37.200\n over space and time.\n\n10:37.200 --> 10:40.940\n And we think about, you know, again, physically with space,\n\n10:40.940 --> 10:43.720\n it's advantageous to an animal or an organism\n\n10:43.720 --> 10:45.940\n to have more territory under its control\n\n10:45.940 --> 10:47.920\n to raise offspring.\n\n10:47.920 --> 10:49.660\n So it's all about reproductive fitness\n\n10:49.660 --> 10:50.880\n at the end of the day.\n\n10:50.880 --> 10:53.840\n And then we'd also think of reproduction itself\n\n10:53.840 --> 10:57.000\n as the genetic impulse to have more,\n\n10:57.000 --> 10:58.880\n to replicate oneself across time.\n\n10:58.880 --> 11:02.000\n So it's territoriality across time in a way.\n\n11:02.000 --> 11:04.040\n And this is very common in most animals.\n\n11:04.040 --> 11:06.380\n Not all animals are territorial, but many are.\n\n11:07.560 --> 11:10.000\n And you see very interesting behaviors\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:11.560\n resulting from territoriality.\n\n11:11.560 --> 11:13.800\n This is like animal combat.\n\n11:13.800 --> 11:16.640\n You know, the reason birds sing is territoriality,\n\n11:17.960 --> 11:19.640\n a number of other things.\n\n11:19.640 --> 11:23.600\n And it's my hypothesis and others have shared\n\n11:23.600 --> 11:28.080\n this hypothesis as well, that mankind is clearly,\n\n11:28.080 --> 11:30.280\n I think, would argue a territorial species\n\n11:30.280 --> 11:35.000\n and that he expresses this territoriality in property rights.\n\n11:35.000 --> 11:38.200\n So property, when we hear that word,\n\n11:38.200 --> 11:39.480\n we typically think of an asset.\n\n11:39.480 --> 11:42.220\n We think of, oh, this house or this stock or whatever.\n\n11:42.220 --> 11:45.080\n But property is actually the socially acknowledged\n\n11:45.080 --> 11:48.140\n relationship between a human and an asset,\n\n11:48.140 --> 11:51.100\n such that you have exclusive rights and responsibilities\n\n11:51.100 --> 11:53.860\n to a particular asset.\n\n11:53.860 --> 11:55.480\n It is not the asset itself.\n\n11:55.480 --> 11:59.480\n So property, it's information, it's a relationship.\n\n11:59.480 --> 12:01.120\n By the way, my mind was just blown.\n\n12:01.120 --> 12:04.200\n Property is information, it's not the actual asset.\n\n12:04.200 --> 12:05.580\n That's really important.\n\n12:05.580 --> 12:06.560\n Very important.\n\n12:06.560 --> 12:07.520\n That's really interesting.\n\n12:07.520 --> 12:12.520\n Yeah, and then it comes down to how do we organize ourselves\n\n12:12.520 --> 12:17.520\n such that property, that the contributions people are making\n\n12:19.400 --> 12:22.160\n are commensurate with the consideration they're receiving.\n\n12:22.160 --> 12:24.720\n So if you're adding value to a piece of property,\n\n12:24.720 --> 12:27.920\n you're developing a piece of land for use,\n\n12:27.920 --> 12:31.880\n in theory, to be fair, you should have the rights\n\n12:31.880 --> 12:34.100\n to that fruit if you go out and plant a garden\n\n12:34.100 --> 12:35.200\n or whatever it may be.\n\n12:37.480 --> 12:41.640\n And this is rooted in natural law,\n\n12:41.640 --> 12:44.440\n where we have rights to life, liberty, and property.\n\n12:44.440 --> 12:46.000\n Those are kind of just the base,\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:49.920\n the fundamental layer of morality and capitalism, frankly.\n\n12:49.920 --> 12:54.320\n And you could think of, to get really primordial with it,\n\n12:54.320 --> 12:57.960\n the first capitalist in the world,\n\n12:57.960 --> 12:59.700\n just to kind of get some definitions out here,\n\n12:59.700 --> 13:03.960\n I'll say capitalism versus communism or socialism\n\n13:03.960 --> 13:06.040\n as the spectrum I'll speak on.\n\n13:06.040 --> 13:09.400\n The first capitalist in the world would be the guy,\n\n13:09.400 --> 13:12.380\n the caveman, that maybe dug a little hole for himself\n\n13:12.380 --> 13:14.920\n to shield himself from the elements.\n\n13:14.920 --> 13:17.240\n Maybe there was a rainstorm or a snowstorm\n\n13:17.240 --> 13:20.600\n and he dug a little enclave and he protected himself.\n\n13:20.600 --> 13:22.920\n I thought you were gonna go, because you said primordial,\n\n13:22.920 --> 13:24.560\n I thought you were gonna go back to like\n\n13:24.560 --> 13:26.160\n earlier biological systems.\n\n13:27.160 --> 13:29.240\n I guess primordial for human, perhaps.\n\n13:29.240 --> 13:30.600\n For humans, yeah.\n\n13:30.600 --> 13:31.440\n Okay.\n\n13:31.440 --> 13:34.100\n And then the first communist or socialist\n\n13:34.100 --> 13:37.360\n would be someone that decided the fruits of his labor\n\n13:37.360 --> 13:38.800\n belonged to him.\n\n13:38.800 --> 13:41.280\n So he would have violently encroached on that individual\n\n13:41.280 --> 13:44.140\n and taken his plot for himself, for his own use.\n\n13:45.180 --> 13:50.180\n And that's the spectrum across which capitalism,\n\n13:50.180 --> 13:53.560\n in the pure sense, and communism in the pure sense operate\n\n13:53.560 --> 13:57.640\n in that capitalism, each individual has the exclusive rights\n\n13:57.640 --> 13:59.180\n to the fruits of their labor.\n\n13:59.180 --> 14:02.160\n So anything they spend their time, effort, energy\n\n14:02.160 --> 14:04.960\n creating in the world, they own the rights to that\n\n14:04.960 --> 14:07.080\n and they can trade those rights with others,\n\n14:07.080 --> 14:10.360\n other self owned people that have done similar things.\n\n14:10.360 --> 14:13.740\n Communism or socialism would imply that other people,\n\n14:13.740 --> 14:16.040\n typically the state, have the rights,\n\n14:16.040 --> 14:19.580\n at least some rights to the value you've created.\n\n14:19.580 --> 14:22.520\n So there's this interesting moment when that first caveman,\n\n14:22.520 --> 14:27.400\n that first capitalist drew a line, a circle in this cave\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:29.920\n and said, you know, this is mine.\n\n14:29.920 --> 14:32.240\n You could say it was free to be claimed\n\n14:32.240 --> 14:33.640\n at the time he claimed it.\n\n14:34.600 --> 14:39.600\n But it's an interesting moment when asset becomes an asset.\n\n14:41.640 --> 14:43.600\n When space time, as you were referring to it,\n\n14:43.600 --> 14:46.860\n becomes something that's now can be possessed\n\n14:46.860 --> 14:47.960\n by a human being.\n\n14:47.960 --> 14:51.100\n Is there something special about this moment?\n\n14:51.100 --> 14:53.820\n Because it feels like, first of all,\n\n14:53.820 --> 14:57.660\n in terms of space and time, it feels like there's a lot\n\n14:57.660 --> 15:02.660\n of available space time yet to be claimed.\n\n15:02.700 --> 15:05.380\n So if we just look at like the universe, right?\n\n15:05.380 --> 15:06.960\n We're talking about, there's a funny thing\n\n15:06.960 --> 15:11.220\n with Elon Musk and Mars, I think they sneaked in there\n\n15:11.220 --> 15:15.540\n for SpaceX, that nobody on earth has any authority\n\n15:15.540 --> 15:18.980\n on Mars or any, this is a very interesting question.\n\n15:18.980 --> 15:20.980\n It seems almost like humorous at this time,\n\n15:20.980 --> 15:25.200\n but perhaps not, perhaps there'll be sections of space,\n\n15:25.200 --> 15:29.020\n not just on planets that are gonna be even fought over.\n\n15:29.020 --> 15:31.020\n So is there something special about this moment?\n\n15:31.020 --> 15:35.140\n Because in discussing sort of violence\n\n15:35.140 --> 15:37.440\n and respect for property, it feels like this is\n\n15:37.440 --> 15:42.440\n a special moment because ultimately conflict arises\n\n15:42.440 --> 15:46.640\n when you make claims on a particular territory.\n\n15:46.640 --> 15:50.200\n It's not always in conflict where people say,\n\n15:50.200 --> 15:52.800\n when you look at Hitler or something, for example,\n\n15:52.800 --> 15:57.040\n his claim would be in many of the lands that he attacked\n\n15:57.040 --> 15:59.720\n and invaded that this is ultimately,\n\n15:59.720 --> 16:01.780\n this has always belonged to Germany.\n\n16:02.680 --> 16:06.200\n So is there something you could say as to like\n\n16:06.200 --> 16:09.440\n what it means to own an asset or a property?\n\n16:09.440 --> 16:14.000\n Yeah, so in the ancient days of hunters and gatherers,\n\n16:14.000 --> 16:19.000\n we could say that property was mostly a loyal title,\n\n16:19.240 --> 16:22.360\n which meant it's just whatever you can defend, right?\n\n16:22.360 --> 16:25.600\n So if you've got knives and daggers and satchels\n\n16:25.600 --> 16:28.760\n and maybe some pelts you've hunted,\n\n16:28.760 --> 16:32.160\n whatever you can hold and defend is yours.\n\n16:32.160 --> 16:35.320\n And there's not like, there's a government to appeal to,\n\n16:35.320 --> 16:39.120\n you're just sort of a free agent operating in the wild,\n\n16:39.120 --> 16:42.740\n defending the assets you can protect on you more or less.\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:48.360\n And what really changed the nature of property\n\n16:48.360 --> 16:50.780\n is when we get into the agricultural age.\n\n16:50.780 --> 16:55.240\n So there's a big flip where we went from just foraging\n\n16:55.240 --> 16:57.320\n and hunting all the time, constantly moving,\n\n16:57.320 --> 17:00.440\n trying to stay alive to deciding we're gonna settle here.\n\n17:00.440 --> 17:03.200\n We figured out how to cultivate crops.\n\n17:03.200 --> 17:06.080\n We can create, we can increase the population\n\n17:06.080 --> 17:08.480\n because we can harvest more energy from the sun\n\n17:08.480 --> 17:11.280\n and we can establish a longer term civilization.\n\n17:11.280 --> 17:13.600\n What happens in that transition\n\n17:13.600 --> 17:16.480\n is that we begin creating economic surplus.\n\n17:16.480 --> 17:17.680\n So for the first time in history,\n\n17:17.680 --> 17:22.040\n we have stock houses of grain to defend\n\n17:22.040 --> 17:25.260\n or maybe meat or cattle or whatever it is we're creating,\n\n17:25.260 --> 17:27.060\n we now have savings.\n\n17:27.960 --> 17:32.960\n And it's at that time when government emerges as well,\n\n17:33.420 --> 17:35.120\n because once you have savings\n\n17:35.120 --> 17:36.320\n or you have an economic surplus,\n\n17:36.320 --> 17:39.000\n you have something that other people want to steal, right?\n\n17:39.000 --> 17:41.760\n This one thing we'll touch on a lot today\n\n17:41.760 --> 17:44.300\n is people always want something for nothing.\n\n17:45.880 --> 17:47.440\n People are always seeking the path\n\n17:47.440 --> 17:48.360\n to get something for nothing.\n\n17:48.360 --> 17:51.600\n And I think that drives a lot of our decision making.\n\n17:51.600 --> 17:53.680\n And it actually encourages us to be innovative\n\n17:53.680 --> 17:54.520\n in a lot of ways, right?\n\n17:54.520 --> 17:58.060\n We're trying to, you could say it's our laziness\n\n17:58.060 --> 17:59.760\n that's helping us be inventive in a way.\n\n17:59.760 --> 18:01.420\n We're trying to accomplish greater results\n\n18:01.420 --> 18:02.940\n with less efforts over time,\n\n18:02.940 --> 18:07.440\n but we can cross that line in seeking something for nothing\n\n18:07.440 --> 18:09.240\n where we start to violate the life, liberty,\n\n18:09.240 --> 18:10.320\n and property of others.\n\n18:10.320 --> 18:13.160\n And that's where we shift from kind of capitalistic society\n\n18:13.160 --> 18:15.560\n to something more communistic.\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:18.840\n And so that's what government is.\n\n18:18.840 --> 18:21.680\n It's a protection producing enterprise\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:25.860\n for the economic surplus generated by a trading society.\n\n18:25.860 --> 18:28.460\n So when people begin to trade,\n\n18:28.460 --> 18:30.920\n they create what's called the division of labor,\n\n18:30.920 --> 18:33.020\n which is a very common economic term,\n\n18:33.020 --> 18:35.440\n basically means you're better at making hats,\n\n18:35.440 --> 18:37.440\n I'm better at making boots.\n\n18:37.440 --> 18:39.840\n If you specialize in hats, I specialize in boots,\n\n18:39.840 --> 18:42.600\n and we trade, we've created a positive sum game\n\n18:42.600 --> 18:43.840\n where you and I both benefit.\n\n18:43.840 --> 18:47.000\n So we become collectively more than the sum of our parts\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.320\n through trade.\n\n18:48.320 --> 18:51.360\n And that's why human beings do trade\n\n18:51.360 --> 18:54.040\n because we become more energy efficient as a result.\n\n18:54.040 --> 18:56.560\n We create more outputs per unit of input.\n\n18:56.560 --> 18:59.280\n And you can think of government in that respect,\n\n18:59.280 --> 19:01.240\n if we're looking at it maybe in a tech sense\n\n19:01.240 --> 19:05.220\n that the economy is the trade network that generates wealth,\n\n19:05.220 --> 19:07.160\n generates innovation, generates all,\n\n19:07.160 --> 19:09.120\n this whole lap of luxury we live in today\n\n19:09.120 --> 19:12.680\n that we've inherited from our forebears is from the market.\n\n19:12.680 --> 19:14.120\n It's not from a government.\n\n19:14.120 --> 19:17.500\n The government is the network security, if you will.\n\n19:17.500 --> 19:21.880\n So we're paying expenses to a vendor to protect peace,\n\n19:21.880 --> 19:24.480\n to preserve life, liberty, and property in that network\n\n19:24.480 --> 19:25.760\n so that we can have, you know,\n\n19:25.760 --> 19:28.100\n when there's inevitably disputes over private property,\n\n19:28.100 --> 19:30.720\n we can have nonviolent dispute resolution\n\n19:30.720 --> 19:31.980\n in the rule of law.\n\n19:33.280 --> 19:36.040\n And we can have a reasonable expectation\n\n19:36.040 --> 19:39.440\n of being able to conduct commerce without violence.\n\n19:39.440 --> 19:43.680\n The problem has been that the protector tends to,\n\n19:43.680 --> 19:46.080\n you know, they're in a monopolistic position, we would say.\n\n19:46.080 --> 19:49.260\n They tend to start abusing that position\n\n19:49.260 --> 19:53.040\n to obtain property for themselves.\n\n19:53.040 --> 19:55.840\n Again, trying to get that something for nothing.\n\n19:55.840 --> 20:00.320\n When you control, you know, you are the security guard\n\n20:00.320 --> 20:02.200\n for the economy.\n\n20:02.200 --> 20:04.680\n The first thing they tend to monopolize is money\n\n20:04.680 --> 20:05.840\n because if you can control the money,\n\n20:05.840 --> 20:08.060\n you're effectively controlling people, their energy,\n\n20:08.060 --> 20:09.240\n their perceptions.\n\n20:10.560 --> 20:12.360\n And that becomes a, you know,\n\n20:12.360 --> 20:14.560\n particularly through inflation,\n\n20:14.560 --> 20:17.520\n becomes an avenue to get something for nothing\n\n20:17.520 --> 20:20.000\n and that you can just print more money\n\n20:20.000 --> 20:22.840\n that everyone else is forced to sacrifice their time\n\n20:22.840 --> 20:24.100\n and energy to obtain.\n\n20:24.100 --> 20:27.580\n What are your thoughts about anarchism?\n\n20:27.580 --> 20:30.940\n So I talk quite a bit, he'll be here in a few days,\n\n20:30.940 --> 20:35.420\n actually, Michael Malice, about ideas of anarchy.\n\n20:35.420 --> 20:38.100\n And his idea or the idea of anarchists\n\n20:38.100 --> 20:42.100\n is that any amount of government will eventually become\n\n20:42.100 --> 20:45.660\n the very kind of thing that you're referring to.\n\n20:45.660 --> 20:48.460\n So there's almost no way to have a government\n\n20:48.460 --> 20:52.180\n that doesn't then try to monopolize power,\n\n20:52.180 --> 20:54.360\n money, and all those kinds of things.\n\n20:54.360 --> 20:56.900\n Do you think it's possible to have a government\n\n20:56.900 --> 20:59.760\n sort of on that spectrum of like anarchy,\n\n20:59.760 --> 21:02.020\n maybe libertarianism,\n\n21:02.020 --> 21:04.620\n I'm not sure how exactly the spectrum goes,\n\n21:04.620 --> 21:07.160\n but where you have a small government\n\n21:07.160 --> 21:09.060\n that protects the liberty and property rights\n\n21:09.060 --> 21:11.940\n and those kinds of things and doesn't expand\n\n21:11.940 --> 21:15.420\n to then also control the monetary system\n\n21:15.420 --> 21:17.620\n and all those other things?\n\n21:17.620 --> 21:18.500\n Is it possible?\n\n21:18.500 --> 21:23.100\n Agreed completely, it was not possible until Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:25.620\n So for the first time in history,\n\n21:25.620 --> 21:29.180\n we have a money that cannot be monopolized,\n\n21:29.180 --> 21:32.020\n cannot be corrupted, cannot be changed,\n\n21:32.920 --> 21:34.460\n cannot be weaponized, frankly.\n\n21:34.460 --> 21:36.680\n Our current monetary system is weaponized\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:39.420\n by those who can print money against those who cannot.\n\n21:41.660 --> 21:45.060\n And I think when you have,\n\n21:45.060 --> 21:46.880\n at the heart of every modern economy,\n\n21:46.880 --> 21:48.620\n which even we could say the US,\n\n21:48.620 --> 21:51.460\n we pride ourselves as free market capitalists.\n\n21:51.460 --> 21:54.320\n You know, we out competed communism in the 20th century.\n\n21:54.320 --> 21:56.460\n We think that this is the superior model.\n\n21:58.080 --> 22:00.540\n Most business people will tell you\n\n22:00.540 --> 22:03.780\n that the free market is the best allocator of resources,\n\n22:03.780 --> 22:05.300\n all of these things.\n\n22:05.300 --> 22:07.500\n But what we have at the heart of every modern economy,\n\n22:07.500 --> 22:10.740\n including the US, is an anti capitalistic institution,\n\n22:10.740 --> 22:12.040\n which is the central bank.\n\n22:13.560 --> 22:15.460\n The temptation to monopolize money\n\n22:15.460 --> 22:17.100\n throughout all of history has been too strong\n\n22:17.100 --> 22:18.680\n for anyone to resist.\n\n22:18.680 --> 22:21.540\n So any, even benevolent, quote unquote,\n\n22:21.540 --> 22:23.400\n dictators that have taken over,\n\n22:23.400 --> 22:25.300\n many dictators have inherited, say,\n\n22:25.300 --> 22:28.260\n an inflationary regime where society is coming apart\n\n22:28.260 --> 22:29.580\n because someone was clipping the coins\n\n22:29.580 --> 22:31.260\n or someone was printing too much money,\n\n22:31.260 --> 22:34.140\n and they'll commit to going back to a hard money standard.\n\n22:34.140 --> 22:37.840\n So they'll keep society on a gold standard, for instance,\n\n22:37.840 --> 22:40.860\n such that they cannot violate the money\n\n22:40.860 --> 22:42.140\n to benefit themselves.\n\n22:42.140 --> 22:45.820\n But inevitably, over time, because it is\n\n22:45.820 --> 22:50.660\n a political institution, there's an incentive there, right?\n\n22:50.660 --> 22:53.140\n For, again, to get something for nothing,\n\n22:53.140 --> 22:57.260\n to spend more than you're making through tax revenues.\n\n22:57.260 --> 22:59.700\n And with that incentive, people typically,\n\n22:59.700 --> 23:03.400\n ultimately end up pursuing that inflationary path.\n\n23:03.400 --> 23:06.680\n So we can get deeper into that about,\n\n23:06.680 --> 23:09.400\n inflation is a term that we've been conditioned\n\n23:09.400 --> 23:10.940\n to think today is just something normal.\n\n23:10.940 --> 23:14.780\n The prices just go up, and then it's pertinent\n\n23:14.780 --> 23:18.820\n to a healthy economy, but it's actually,\n\n23:18.820 --> 23:20.300\n if you look at it from real first principles,\n\n23:20.300 --> 23:22.540\n it is just theft integrated into the money.\n\n23:22.540 --> 23:23.980\n It's a technology backdoor,\n\n23:23.980 --> 23:25.420\n is another way to think about it.\n\n23:25.420 --> 23:27.500\n You wouldn't buy a cell phone knowing\n\n23:27.500 --> 23:30.420\n that someone could siphon your data off your private calls\n\n23:30.420 --> 23:31.980\n and sell it into the market.\n\n23:31.980 --> 23:33.700\n Now, I know we do that with a lot of social media stuff\n\n23:33.700 --> 23:35.180\n today, and that's something else we can get into,\n\n23:35.180 --> 23:37.580\n but you wouldn't do it willingly, right?\n\n23:37.580 --> 23:40.280\n You prefer that your cell phone and your data\n\n23:40.280 --> 23:43.140\n was monetized by you, or if you're gonna sell it,\n\n23:43.140 --> 23:45.420\n you would be able to selectively sell it.\n\n23:45.420 --> 23:49.100\n Inflation is that it's similar, it's a tech backdoor.\n\n23:49.100 --> 23:53.500\n So it's a money that only a few people\n\n23:53.500 --> 23:58.340\n can siphon value off of surreptitiously, typically slowly,\n\n23:58.340 --> 24:00.080\n but eventually, as we've seen throughout history,\n\n24:00.080 --> 24:02.580\n that slowly builds up into a rapidly\n\n24:02.580 --> 24:05.820\n and then causes the monetary system to collapse.\n\n24:05.820 --> 24:08.400\n Do you think there's a benefit to inflation, possibly?\n\n24:08.400 --> 24:12.420\n So when you have perfect information,\n\n24:12.420 --> 24:14.260\n perhaps you don't need inflation,\n\n24:14.260 --> 24:17.220\n perhaps it is purely theft, but I think of inflation\n\n24:17.220 --> 24:19.540\n as like the snooze button on the alarm.\n\n24:21.860 --> 24:23.460\n So if you have a hard standard,\n\n24:23.460 --> 24:25.820\n you better wake up when the alarm rings,\n\n24:25.820 --> 24:29.340\n but all of us kind of like probably shouldn't,\n\n24:29.340 --> 24:30.700\n but use the snooze button.\n\n24:30.700 --> 24:32.220\n It's like, okay, well, five more minutes\n\n24:32.220 --> 24:34.860\n or 10 more minutes, and then you're saying\n\n24:34.860 --> 24:36.980\n there's naturally a slippery slope\n\n24:36.980 --> 24:40.140\n where it becomes a drug that you fall in love with\n\n24:40.140 --> 24:43.980\n and you abuse, but nevertheless,\n\n24:43.980 --> 24:46.260\n the usefulness of the snooze button\n\n24:46.260 --> 24:48.860\n is that you don't know how you'll be actually feeling\n\n24:48.860 --> 24:50.300\n when the alarm rings.\n\n24:50.300 --> 24:52.220\n You might be able to ready to pop up.\n\n24:52.220 --> 24:55.420\n It might be like you really need those few more minutes\n\n24:55.420 --> 24:57.540\n to psychologically get yourself out of bed.\n\n24:57.540 --> 24:59.820\n This metaphor is just not working at all,\n\n24:59.820 --> 25:04.820\n but do you think there's a use to inflation sometimes\n\n25:04.820 --> 25:06.900\n from like an economics perspective?\n\n25:06.900 --> 25:09.620\n I think the drug metaphor is a little more apt\n\n25:09.620 --> 25:12.260\n in that inflation does provide\n\n25:12.260 --> 25:17.260\n an immediately stimulative effect when used early on.\n\n25:19.620 --> 25:22.980\n But what it's doing is it's, again,\n\n25:22.980 --> 25:26.140\n we talk about the balance between incentives\n\n25:26.140 --> 25:27.340\n and disincentives, right?\n\n25:27.340 --> 25:31.580\n That being necessary for a system to function properly.\n\n25:31.580 --> 25:35.620\n With inflation, you're essentially giving the people\n\n25:35.620 --> 25:38.420\n that can print money a way to dampen\n\n25:38.420 --> 25:40.780\n the disincentives they face.\n\n25:40.780 --> 25:45.780\n So it destroys feedback loops, I guess you might say.\n\n25:46.580 --> 25:49.340\n And another way to look at this is when you,\n\n25:49.340 --> 25:52.260\n so using inflation, using quantitative easing,\n\n25:52.260 --> 25:56.880\n you can decrease short term volatility in the marketplace.\n\n25:56.880 --> 26:01.140\n So the market is basically this idea,\n\n26:01.140 --> 26:03.300\n this form of free exchange that's trying to zero in\n\n26:03.300 --> 26:04.500\n on the best ideas.\n\n26:04.500 --> 26:07.020\n And the ideas are those that are most fit to reality,\n\n26:07.020 --> 26:08.780\n to satisfying the most wants.\n\n26:08.780 --> 26:10.380\n It's gonna overshoot, it's gonna undershoot,\n\n26:10.380 --> 26:12.020\n you have these little business cycles.\n\n26:12.020 --> 26:13.500\n But when it's undershooting\n\n26:13.500 --> 26:16.860\n and you're experiencing a business recession,\n\n26:18.020 --> 26:19.140\n in a capitalist environment,\n\n26:19.140 --> 26:21.940\n the market needs to clear that malinvestment,\n\n26:21.940 --> 26:23.260\n that misallocation of capital.\n\n26:23.260 --> 26:25.420\n That means someone made a bet on a certain idea\n\n26:25.420 --> 26:27.820\n that it would satisfy wants in a particular way,\n\n26:27.820 --> 26:29.460\n and that bet did not pan out.\n\n26:29.460 --> 26:31.460\n If you then paper over the losses\n\n26:31.460 --> 26:33.020\n that business is creating,\n\n26:33.020 --> 26:36.820\n you're now delaying and exacerbating the volatility\n\n26:36.820 --> 26:39.140\n that that idea created.\n\n26:39.140 --> 26:41.400\n So this is kind of a Tel Aviv concept\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:46.060\n where you can dampen short run volatility,\n\n26:46.060 --> 26:48.340\n but volatility is truth.\n\n26:48.340 --> 26:53.340\n Volatility is us matching our ideas to reality, right?\n\n26:53.420 --> 26:55.200\n We're constantly, again, overshooting and undershooting.\n\n26:55.200 --> 26:57.640\n So you delay volatility,\n\n26:57.640 --> 26:59.820\n you're just amplifying it and exacerbating it\n\n26:59.820 --> 27:01.180\n in the long run.\n\n27:01.180 --> 27:02.740\n And that's what central bank is doing.\n\n27:02.740 --> 27:06.860\n The central bank mandate is low unemployment\n\n27:06.860 --> 27:11.280\n and low and expected inflation, basically.\n\n27:13.300 --> 27:16.820\n And so they're trying to achieve economic growth\n\n27:16.820 --> 27:19.500\n in a stable way, quote unquote, stable way.\n\n27:19.500 --> 27:21.200\n This is their ostensible purpose.\n\n27:22.380 --> 27:23.940\n And that's just not possible.\n\n27:23.940 --> 27:27.780\n Growth is an inherently instable process.\n\n27:27.780 --> 27:29.420\n Can you elaborate a little bit\n\n27:29.420 --> 27:33.380\n about the nature of volatility?\n\n27:33.380 --> 27:35.820\n Why is it communicating truth?\n\n27:37.140 --> 27:39.060\n That's something that a lot of people are afraid of\n\n27:39.060 --> 27:40.340\n is the volatility.\n\n27:40.340 --> 27:44.260\n Almost like it's a sign of chaos,\n\n27:44.260 --> 27:48.220\n and so they want to escape chaos.\n\n27:48.220 --> 27:51.740\n But you're saying that that's actually,\n\n27:51.740 --> 27:53.640\n whether it's chaos or not, I don't know,\n\n27:53.640 --> 27:57.600\n but it's getting us closer to the fundamental reality\n\n27:57.600 --> 28:00.100\n that we should not be trying to escape.\n\n28:00.100 --> 28:04.980\n Yeah, so if we consider that the universe\n\n28:04.980 --> 28:06.980\n is pervaded by entropy, right?\n\n28:06.980 --> 28:08.780\n This is the second law of thermodynamics\n\n28:08.780 --> 28:10.080\n is that every closed system\n\n28:10.080 --> 28:12.620\n tends towards greater disorder over time.\n\n28:13.500 --> 28:15.420\n And that life itself, again,\n\n28:15.420 --> 28:17.740\n I would argue expressed through the logos,\n\n28:19.080 --> 28:22.180\n we, life, is the antientropic principle.\n\n28:22.180 --> 28:24.740\n It's the only thing that's converting entropy into order,\n\n28:24.740 --> 28:26.500\n chaos into order.\n\n28:26.500 --> 28:29.980\n And that's what entrepreneurs are doing, right?\n\n28:29.980 --> 28:32.700\n We're living at the edges of the known,\n\n28:32.700 --> 28:37.240\n and we're testing ourself against the entropy of nature,\n\n28:37.240 --> 28:38.900\n trying to figure out new and better ways\n\n28:38.900 --> 28:41.020\n of saying, doing, or making things.\n\n28:41.020 --> 28:44.260\n And then if we do crack a code or figure something out,\n\n28:44.260 --> 28:45.700\n we then have a big incentive.\n\n28:45.700 --> 28:47.180\n The incentive is to get rich, right?\n\n28:47.180 --> 28:48.380\n Because then you have a new idea\n\n28:48.380 --> 28:50.940\n that you could then sell back into the marketplace.\n\n28:50.940 --> 28:55.940\n So it's this sequence of courageously confronting\n\n28:57.360 --> 28:59.500\n the entropy of nature and converting it\n\n28:59.500 --> 29:00.820\n into good and useful order,\n\n29:00.820 --> 29:04.100\n which by the way is like the ancient idea of God in Genesis,\n\n29:04.100 --> 29:05.600\n which I think is interesting,\n\n29:06.900 --> 29:10.120\n that actually enables us to construct civilization\n\n29:10.120 --> 29:14.900\n in these layers of anti entropy or order, you might say.\n\n29:14.900 --> 29:19.900\n So today we live in a bubble of anti entropy or order,\n\n29:19.900 --> 29:22.300\n like the coastlines are guarded by the nation\n\n29:22.300 --> 29:25.340\n and the city has a certain police force\n\n29:25.340 --> 29:26.740\n that keeps it in order.\n\n29:27.940 --> 29:30.260\n Even the way we talk,\n\n29:30.260 --> 29:31.780\n like clearly the words matter,\n\n29:31.780 --> 29:33.060\n but also the nonverbal cues,\n\n29:33.060 --> 29:35.340\n all these things are like order that has been established\n\n29:35.340 --> 29:39.780\n over many, many, many thousands of years of human evolution.\n\n29:40.660 --> 29:45.660\n And I think that's, when I say volatility is truth,\n\n29:46.180 --> 29:49.340\n what I'm saying is that the experience of uncertainty\n\n29:49.340 --> 29:53.580\n is something that's ineradicable from life, right?\n\n29:53.580 --> 29:57.060\n And certainty, like it's kind of a paradox\n\n29:57.060 --> 29:58.980\n because we're fighting against it, right?\n\n29:58.980 --> 30:01.460\n We're trying to innovate our way away from uncertainty\n\n30:01.460 --> 30:03.640\n to create more capital,\n\n30:03.640 --> 30:08.640\n which capital is very simply a way of mitigating uncertainty.\n\n30:09.540 --> 30:12.340\n So this is why you might have like a stash of food\n\n30:12.340 --> 30:14.620\n in case the power goes out or a generator,\n\n30:14.620 --> 30:17.780\n like it helps you overcome uncertainty over time.\n\n30:17.780 --> 30:21.420\n But uncertainty is also where all the sweetness of life is.\n\n30:21.420 --> 30:22.660\n So there's gotta be this balance\n\n30:22.660 --> 30:24.220\n with one foot in, one foot out.\n\n30:25.300 --> 30:27.500\n So human society is this kind of bubble of order\n\n30:27.500 --> 30:30.460\n that we've constructed and slowly expanding,\n\n30:30.460 --> 30:33.180\n but at the edges, you're always going to have that chaos,\n\n30:33.180 --> 30:36.180\n that volatility, and that the entrepreneurs\n\n30:36.180 --> 30:39.460\n are kind of like jumping into that chaos\n\n30:39.460 --> 30:42.000\n and some of them die and some of them succeed.\n\n30:42.000 --> 30:46.380\n And so like, if you wanna grow this bubble of order,\n\n30:46.380 --> 30:51.380\n you have to be embracing the volatility at the edges.\n\n30:51.380 --> 30:52.220\n Yes.\n\n30:53.400 --> 30:55.100\n And reverence for entrepreneurship\n\n30:55.100 --> 30:58.940\n because these are the people putting their neck out,\n\n30:58.940 --> 31:01.260\n so to speak, risking themselves.\n\n31:01.260 --> 31:03.220\n And they're gonna contribute to society, by the way,\n\n31:03.220 --> 31:05.100\n whether they go up in flames or not.\n\n31:05.100 --> 31:06.340\n If they go up in flames,\n\n31:06.340 --> 31:08.560\n society has witnessed their experience\n\n31:08.560 --> 31:10.660\n as something not to do or something that doesn't work\n\n31:10.660 --> 31:12.380\n in a particular time and place.\n\n31:12.380 --> 31:14.780\n So that you could say them going up in flames\n\n31:14.780 --> 31:16.780\n is a way of enlightening the rest of us.\n\n31:16.780 --> 31:18.980\n Or if they figure something out,\n\n31:18.980 --> 31:22.780\n Steve Jobs creates the iPhone, changes the world forever.\n\n31:22.780 --> 31:25.780\n So enlightening the rest of us, okay.\n\n31:25.780 --> 31:26.900\n And Taleb would say.\n\n31:26.900 --> 31:28.580\n The fire of their failure, okay.\n\n31:28.580 --> 31:30.020\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n31:30.020 --> 31:35.020\n Taleb would say individual fragility\n\n31:35.020 --> 31:38.580\n is inseparable from ensemble anti fragility.\n\n31:38.580 --> 31:40.620\n So this means that, again,\n\n31:40.620 --> 31:42.760\n every time that entrepreneur goes up in flames\n\n31:42.760 --> 31:46.020\n or say a restaurant goes out of business,\n\n31:46.020 --> 31:47.380\n when a restaurant goes out of business,\n\n31:47.380 --> 31:50.220\n that particular cuisine strategy they were implementing\n\n31:50.220 --> 31:51.580\n in that particular time and place,\n\n31:51.580 --> 31:53.500\n that's a signal to all the other restaurants in the area\n\n31:53.500 --> 31:54.900\n that that doesn't work.\n\n31:54.900 --> 31:59.660\n So restaurant food improves from bankruptcy to bankruptcy.\n\n31:59.660 --> 32:02.420\n So it's this death of the individual components\n\n32:02.420 --> 32:05.460\n that contributes to the growth of the ensemble.\n\n32:05.460 --> 32:07.860\n As a small aside, maybe you can guide me through it.\n\n32:07.860 --> 32:09.300\n I don't know if you're paying attention,\n\n32:09.300 --> 32:13.780\n but there was some chaos around Taleb\n\n32:13.780 --> 32:15.580\n and the Bitcoin community.\n\n32:15.580 --> 32:17.960\n I wasn't quite paying attention,\n\n32:17.960 --> 32:20.220\n but from my outsider's perspective,\n\n32:20.220 --> 32:24.500\n I thought it seemed Taleb was a supporter of Bitcoin.\n\n32:24.500 --> 32:26.900\n And then a lot of people were very upset about something.\n\n32:26.900 --> 32:28.260\n I'm sorry if I don't know the details,\n\n32:28.260 --> 32:33.020\n but can you pull out some profound philosophical ideas\n\n32:33.020 --> 32:34.860\n from the disagreement of the chaos?\n\n32:34.860 --> 32:37.940\n I admittedly don't know too much about it either.\n\n32:37.940 --> 32:40.160\n I'm a big fan of his writing.\n\n32:41.300 --> 32:45.780\n He's always been a little different in person.\n\n32:45.780 --> 32:47.500\n Like I actually, he signed one of my books.\n\n32:47.500 --> 32:48.340\n I met him in person.\n\n32:48.340 --> 32:50.660\n He's just, he's got a very abrasive personality.\n\n32:50.660 --> 32:51.580\n He's kind of known for it.\n\n32:51.580 --> 32:54.140\n It's not, I don't think I'm passing any judgment here.\n\n32:54.140 --> 32:55.540\n He sort of embraces it.\n\n32:55.540 --> 32:56.380\n Yeah.\n\n32:56.380 --> 32:58.980\n But he had written the forward\n\n32:58.980 --> 33:00.680\n to a really important book in Bitcoin\n\n33:00.680 --> 33:03.800\n called the Bitcoin Standard for safety in a moose.\n\n33:03.800 --> 33:06.900\n And then I think they had a little Twitter beef\n\n33:06.900 --> 33:10.880\n because safety is very much against COVID mask\n\n33:10.880 --> 33:12.700\n and state intervention,\n\n33:12.700 --> 33:15.340\n whereas Taleb's on the other side of the fence.\n\n33:15.340 --> 33:17.900\n And so, and then after that beef,\n\n33:17.900 --> 33:19.580\n Taleb came out against Bitcoiners saying,\n\n33:19.580 --> 33:21.840\n oh, Bitcoiners are crazy and wrong.\n\n33:21.840 --> 33:24.700\n I think the great mask debate of the 2020\n\n33:24.700 --> 33:25.820\n will probably be the thing\n\n33:25.820 --> 33:28.380\n that ultimately leads to World War III.\n\n33:28.380 --> 33:33.380\n I've been very surprised how tense, how much like division\n\n33:33.380 --> 33:38.380\n this one little arguably silly thing has led to.\n\n33:39.140 --> 33:41.580\n I think a lot of people sort of project their,\n\n33:41.580 --> 33:44.020\n like, it's almost like not wearing a mask\n\n33:44.020 --> 33:46.500\n is a statement of sovereignty, of freedom,\n\n33:46.500 --> 33:48.860\n of like saying fuck you to the man,\n\n33:48.860 --> 33:50.900\n the government, the centralized power,\n\n33:50.900 --> 33:55.180\n or the dishonesty or the, in the scientific community,\n\n33:55.180 --> 33:56.260\n all those kinds of things.\n\n33:56.260 --> 33:59.520\n And then wearing a mask is a sort of kind of signaling\n\n33:59.520 --> 34:03.600\n of various kind of social aspects.\n\n34:03.600 --> 34:04.440\n I don't know.\n\n34:04.440 --> 34:05.500\n I'm not paying attention to it.\n\n34:05.500 --> 34:06.820\n I actually tuned out.\n\n34:06.820 --> 34:08.480\n I was part of a group of scientists\n\n34:08.480 --> 34:10.580\n that were looking into like, do masks work?\n\n34:10.580 --> 34:11.980\n This very interesting question.\n\n34:11.980 --> 34:13.880\n To me, it was an interesting question.\n\n34:13.880 --> 34:17.580\n I sort of roll in to ask that very interesting question\n\n34:17.580 --> 34:20.500\n because I think it is an interesting scientific question.\n\n34:20.500 --> 34:23.820\n But then I quickly realized that just as I was doing this,\n\n34:23.820 --> 34:27.560\n like scientific exploration of this very interesting question\n\n34:27.560 --> 34:30.300\n about Viron particles, like what kind of things,\n\n34:30.300 --> 34:32.300\n like from a scientific perspective,\n\n34:32.300 --> 34:34.400\n how do we prevent the spread of a pandemic?\n\n34:34.400 --> 34:38.020\n Forget COVID, any pandemic, super deadly or not deadly.\n\n34:38.020 --> 34:40.660\n Like there's tools, there's testing, there's masks,\n\n34:40.660 --> 34:43.220\n there's all these tools, how well do they work?\n\n34:43.220 --> 34:46.740\n And then I realized, you know, in April or so,\n\n34:46.740 --> 34:49.980\n it became a tool of politics, a tool of philosophy.\n\n34:49.980 --> 34:51.900\n And that's when I sort of pulled out.\n\n34:51.900 --> 34:52.740\n So it's fascinating.\n\n34:52.740 --> 34:56.740\n I think it's a canvas on which people project\n\n34:56.740 --> 34:59.900\n their emotions and I guess Tillam got caught up\n\n34:59.900 --> 35:02.480\n in that kind of, so there's nothing fundamental,\n\n35:02.480 --> 35:04.540\n I suppose, to their disagreement.\n\n35:04.540 --> 35:07.880\n Not that I'm aware of, but he is, you know,\n\n35:07.880 --> 35:11.340\n he's written some about in his books,\n\n35:11.340 --> 35:13.220\n the problem with centralization.\n\n35:13.220 --> 35:15.860\n I mean, a lot of his writing addresses that\n\n35:15.860 --> 35:18.620\n and he actually points to, I think Switzerland\n\n35:18.620 --> 35:20.300\n is the best government in the world\n\n35:20.300 --> 35:21.700\n because it's decentralized.\n\n35:21.700 --> 35:26.700\n So there's that, I don't think he has any,\n\n35:26.900 --> 35:30.700\n I'm not to speak for him, but I don't think he's voiced\n\n35:30.700 --> 35:34.640\n any specific critiques on Bitcoin per se.\n\n35:34.640 --> 35:35.740\n Could be wrong about that.\n\n35:35.740 --> 35:37.820\n It's just maybe his flavorful language\n\n35:37.820 --> 35:39.580\n and the way he likes to communicate.\n\n35:39.580 --> 35:42.300\n And the other theory is that maybe he's playing 4D chess\n\n35:42.300 --> 35:44.580\n and having a Twitter boating accident, you know.\n\n35:44.580 --> 35:48.140\n So I don't believe in Bitcoin, I've sold all my Bitcoin.\n\n35:48.140 --> 35:48.980\n Oh, I see.\n\n35:48.980 --> 35:49.820\n Yeah.\n\n35:49.820 --> 35:53.780\n Sorry, the boating accident in Bitcoin is this,\n\n35:55.020 --> 35:56.740\n I guess it's proverbial by this point,\n\n35:56.740 --> 35:59.360\n where it's the way you lose your Bitcoin.\n\n35:59.360 --> 36:00.880\n So if someone comes after you and says,\n\n36:00.880 --> 36:02.880\n hey, you know, whether it's a government\n\n36:02.880 --> 36:04.200\n or an individual's coming after you saying,\n\n36:04.200 --> 36:06.780\n give me all your Bitcoin or pay these taxes in Bitcoin,\n\n36:06.780 --> 36:09.060\n you go, oh, I had a boating accident and lost them all.\n\n36:09.060 --> 36:09.900\n Lost them all.\n\n36:09.900 --> 36:10.740\n So, yeah.\n\n36:13.380 --> 36:16.500\n But back to the fundamental nature of space time.\n\n36:16.500 --> 36:20.180\n Let me ask you, because we're kind of left at,\n\n36:20.180 --> 36:22.720\n I'd like to go back to this idea of,\n\n36:24.160 --> 36:26.520\n that you said that everything we think, say,\n\n36:26.520 --> 36:29.100\n or do occurs within the bounds of space time.\n\n36:31.180 --> 36:33.580\n So first of all, maybe you can comment on\n\n36:33.580 --> 36:37.140\n what do you mean in this context about space time,\n\n36:37.140 --> 36:40.660\n but also about the nature of truth.\n\n36:40.660 --> 36:43.480\n Like how much of all of this is knowable?\n\n36:43.480 --> 36:46.400\n How much of this is accessible to us humans?\n\n36:46.400 --> 36:49.180\n How much uncertainty, like what we're talking about,\n\n36:49.180 --> 36:50.720\n is there in the world?\n\n36:50.720 --> 36:52.300\n Are you, do you fall in a place\n\n36:52.300 --> 36:56.060\n where we can reason deeply about this world\n\n36:56.060 --> 36:58.540\n and it's knowable, or is it mostly chaos\n\n36:58.540 --> 37:01.380\n and we're just holding on for dear life?\n\n37:01.380 --> 37:04.220\n Yeah, I think I said that all action occurs\n\n37:04.220 --> 37:05.560\n within the bounds of space time.\n\n37:05.560 --> 37:08.200\n The other thing, everything we say, do, or make,\n\n37:08.200 --> 37:10.380\n the other thing is that everything we say, do, or make\n\n37:10.380 --> 37:12.460\n starts out as an idea.\n\n37:12.460 --> 37:15.520\n So there's this concept of universal Darwinism,\n\n37:15.520 --> 37:20.060\n which basically applies Darwinian principles,\n\n37:20.060 --> 37:21.980\n but outside of the biological sphere.\n\n37:21.980 --> 37:23.820\n So we could say that this kind of gets into\n\n37:23.820 --> 37:27.220\n Richard Dawkins memetics, that even ideas are competing,\n\n37:27.220 --> 37:29.180\n reproducing, recombining.\n\n37:29.180 --> 37:30.860\n That idea is so powerful, by the way.\n\n37:30.860 --> 37:33.900\n I don't think it's been understood fully.\n\n37:33.900 --> 37:38.900\n I think in the digital, in the 21st century,\n\n37:38.940 --> 37:40.580\n in the digital world, from my perspective\n\n37:40.580 --> 37:42.540\n in artificial intelligence,\n\n37:42.540 --> 37:44.500\n there's yet to be some profound things\n\n37:44.500 --> 37:47.220\n to be discovered about this whole construct.\n\n37:47.220 --> 37:48.860\n Agreed completely.\n\n37:48.860 --> 37:51.540\n It's been called an acid, actually,\n\n37:51.540 --> 37:55.580\n in that it strips away all of the noninformational\n\n37:55.580 --> 37:57.140\n components of something, just strips it down\n\n37:57.140 --> 37:59.140\n to its bare bones.\n\n37:59.140 --> 38:02.140\n I have a quote in here somewhere about that, but.\n\n38:02.140 --> 38:03.500\n I'm sorry, which is called an acid?\n\n38:03.500 --> 38:04.340\n The ideas?\n\n38:04.340 --> 38:05.860\n The universal Darwinism.\n\n38:05.860 --> 38:08.100\n Darwinism applied broadly, outside of the.\n\n38:08.100 --> 38:12.740\n Applied broadly, and I'll condition all of this\n\n38:12.740 --> 38:14.540\n by saying that a lot, most of my thinking\n\n38:14.540 --> 38:16.300\n is shaped by a book I read recently\n\n38:16.300 --> 38:17.900\n called The Case Against Reality,\n\n38:19.340 --> 38:20.660\n which introduced me to this concept,\n\n38:20.660 --> 38:23.380\n but it tied into Darwinism that I've used\n\n38:23.380 --> 38:24.760\n more broadly in the past, looking at things\n\n38:24.760 --> 38:26.340\n like money and economics.\n\n38:26.340 --> 38:28.640\n So the book, The Case Against Reality,\n\n38:28.640 --> 38:32.860\n by Donald Hoffman, he has a quote in the book\n\n38:32.860 --> 38:35.740\n that describes universal Darwinism.\n\n38:35.740 --> 38:37.640\n It says, quote, universal Darwinism can,\n\n38:37.640 --> 38:39.340\n without risk of refuting itself,\n\n38:39.340 --> 38:41.500\n address our key question.\n\n38:41.500 --> 38:44.820\n Does natural selection favor true perceptions?\n\n38:44.820 --> 38:46.780\n If the answer happens to be no,\n\n38:46.780 --> 38:49.160\n then it hasn't shot itself in the foot.\n\n38:49.160 --> 38:51.300\n The uncanny power of universal Darwinism\n\n38:51.300 --> 38:54.120\n has been likened by the philosopher Dan Dennett\n\n38:54.120 --> 38:55.700\n to a universal acid.\n\n38:56.740 --> 38:58.940\n And Dan Dennett says, quote, there is no denying\n\n38:58.940 --> 39:02.380\n at this point that Darwin's idea is a universal solvent,\n\n39:02.380 --> 39:04.020\n capable of cutting right to the heart\n\n39:04.020 --> 39:05.720\n of everything in sight.\n\n39:05.720 --> 39:08.500\n The question is, what does it leave behind?\n\n39:08.500 --> 39:10.860\n I have tried to show that once it passes through everything,\n\n39:10.860 --> 39:13.100\n we are left with stronger, sounder versions\n\n39:13.100 --> 39:15.740\n of our most important ideas.\n\n39:15.740 --> 39:17.880\n Some of the traditional details perish,\n\n39:17.880 --> 39:20.380\n and some of these are losses to be regretted,\n\n39:20.380 --> 39:22.220\n but good riddance to the rest of them.\n\n39:22.220 --> 39:25.140\n What remains is more than enough to build on, unquote.\n\n39:26.340 --> 39:31.340\n So the way I would interpret that is that life itself,\n\n39:31.660 --> 39:34.620\n I've come to view life as information propagating\n\n39:34.620 --> 39:38.620\n through flesh, and that we are,\n\n39:38.620 --> 39:42.820\n I guess DNA is a quadratic code.\n\n39:42.820 --> 39:44.220\n I think it's four letters, maybe,\n\n39:44.220 --> 39:46.540\n versus a binary, zeros and ones.\n\n39:46.540 --> 39:49.620\n And we are ideas, we are strategies competing\n\n39:49.620 --> 39:54.300\n with each other, and nature is that which selects.\n\n39:54.300 --> 39:56.500\n It's what selects the winning ideas,\n\n39:56.500 --> 39:57.740\n the ones that are most fit\n\n39:59.100 --> 40:02.400\n to environmental conditions, frankly.\n\n40:02.400 --> 40:06.280\n You know, talking about sovereignty and individualism,\n\n40:06.280 --> 40:10.680\n there might need to be some rethinking here\n\n40:10.680 --> 40:13.940\n about what is actually the basic individual entity\n\n40:13.940 --> 40:15.600\n that is to be sovereign.\n\n40:15.600 --> 40:20.600\n Like maybe our biological meat vehicles\n\n40:20.760 --> 40:23.400\n were like way overly attached to them.\n\n40:25.220 --> 40:28.040\n Like maybe, especially with genetics\n\n40:28.040 --> 40:29.000\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n40:29.000 --> 40:31.120\n or artificial intelligence, or living more and more\n\n40:31.120 --> 40:34.200\n in virtual worlds will become detached\n\n40:34.200 --> 40:35.860\n from that kind of idea.\n\n40:35.860 --> 40:38.280\n So for example, if I can clone you,\n\n40:38.280 --> 40:42.280\n you know, make one million robbers,\n\n40:42.280 --> 40:46.160\n and, you know, but you'll all have the same idea,\n\n40:46.160 --> 40:48.880\n what is your real value as the,\n\n40:48.880 --> 40:50.000\n like I could just shoot you,\n\n40:50.000 --> 40:52.840\n and there'll still be 999 of you,\n\n40:52.840 --> 40:55.200\n but the idea is the important thing,\n\n40:55.200 --> 40:57.120\n the things you believe, so.\n\n40:58.260 --> 41:00.200\n I would argue that I don't know,\n\n41:00.200 --> 41:02.080\n even if you clone someone perfectly,\n\n41:02.080 --> 41:05.500\n I don't think you can reproduce the individual themselves,\n\n41:05.500 --> 41:09.000\n because we're all a product of nature and nurture, right?\n\n41:09.000 --> 41:12.380\n So my particular concourse of experiences,\n\n41:12.380 --> 41:15.800\n the path dependence that I represent cannot be replicated,\n\n41:15.800 --> 41:17.560\n nor can anyone's for that matter.\n\n41:17.560 --> 41:20.520\n Well, that's a hypothesis, so.\n\n41:20.520 --> 41:21.360\n True.\n\n41:21.360 --> 41:25.720\n That's of course a human meat bag would say.\n\n41:27.240 --> 41:28.080\n Good point.\n\n41:29.640 --> 41:31.920\n Like desperate trying to preserve himself.\n\n41:31.920 --> 41:33.960\n You know, I think it reduces\n\n41:33.960 --> 41:36.440\n to some fundamental questions about what is consciousness,\n\n41:36.440 --> 41:38.000\n and whether that can be cloned.\n\n41:38.000 --> 41:39.200\n All those kind of, you know,\n\n41:39.200 --> 41:41.880\n it gets to the core of what it is to be human.\n\n41:41.880 --> 41:45.160\n What are the things that make you particularly you?\n\n41:45.160 --> 41:46.880\n Yeah, I think it would assume\n\n41:46.880 --> 41:49.200\n kind of a materialist viewpoint on reality,\n\n41:49.200 --> 41:52.160\n and that if you could reproduce every atom of an individual\n\n41:52.160 --> 41:55.160\n that you would have their experience encapsulated in that.\n\n41:55.160 --> 41:58.620\n And, you know, Hoffman's, which his book is very radical,\n\n41:58.620 --> 42:03.620\n he argues that space and time is not an objective reality,\n\n42:03.620 --> 42:06.040\n it's a biological interface.\n\n42:06.040 --> 42:11.040\n So we are scanning our environment for fitness payoffs,\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:13.520\n and this space and time is the rendering\n\n42:13.520 --> 42:15.040\n specific to human beings\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:18.960\n that allows us to navigate reality effectively.\n\n42:18.960 --> 42:20.840\n So the further argument would be\n\n42:20.840 --> 42:23.240\n that we all have pretty similar interfaces,\n\n42:23.240 --> 42:25.000\n but they're all slightly different too,\n\n42:25.000 --> 42:27.120\n because we're all, you know, adapting in different ways,\n\n42:27.120 --> 42:30.280\n and that different animals have their own unique interfaces.\n\n42:30.280 --> 42:32.780\n So we have a certain amount of photoreceptors in our eye,\n\n42:32.780 --> 42:35.920\n whereas I think the number is three, might be five,\n\n42:35.920 --> 42:39.320\n or something like the mantis shrimp has like seven or nine.\n\n42:39.320 --> 42:40.960\n So they can see,\n\n42:40.960 --> 42:45.960\n and we only see one 10 trillionth of the light spectrum.\n\n42:46.960 --> 42:48.640\n So talk about a tiny fraction.\n\n42:48.640 --> 42:51.640\n I mean, one 10 trillionth is a very minuscule number,\n\n42:51.640 --> 42:53.340\n and that makes up all of the light\n\n42:53.340 --> 42:55.320\n that we can interpret with our eyes.\n\n42:55.320 --> 42:56.480\n But something like a mantis shrimp\n\n42:56.480 --> 42:58.760\n could see, you know, much more of that.\n\n42:58.760 --> 43:03.760\n So I think there's this, we're very conditioned\n\n43:04.160 --> 43:07.280\n to have a fully materialist viewpoint on reality today,\n\n43:07.280 --> 43:10.280\n where we think, you know,\n\n43:10.280 --> 43:12.940\n the atomic clockwork kind of universe.\n\n43:12.940 --> 43:16.460\n But I think there's, I don't think that's true exactly.\n\n43:16.460 --> 43:19.740\n And another school that goes into that\n\n43:19.740 --> 43:22.000\n is actually Austrian economics,\n\n43:22.000 --> 43:24.640\n where we could say that, you know,\n\n43:24.640 --> 43:27.580\n we mentioned earlier that an asset is not property.\n\n43:27.580 --> 43:29.120\n It's actually based on the relationship\n\n43:29.120 --> 43:31.120\n between the individual and the property.\n\n43:32.720 --> 43:36.920\n There's this whole realm of relevance associated with,\n\n43:39.860 --> 43:41.600\n we're all moving through life\n\n43:41.600 --> 43:43.540\n in the course of a goal directed action.\n\n43:43.540 --> 43:47.400\n So when we walk across a room, I go from A to B,\n\n43:47.400 --> 43:50.160\n it's because I valued B more than A.\n\n43:50.160 --> 43:52.920\n So value is inseparable from human action.\n\n43:52.920 --> 43:56.160\n We have a rank ordered value system in our mind,\n\n43:56.160 --> 43:58.360\n each of us, and we're constantly taking action\n\n43:58.360 --> 44:00.440\n in accordance with those rank values.\n\n44:01.500 --> 44:04.560\n Anything that accelerates us on the course\n\n44:04.560 --> 44:08.480\n of our goal directed action towards our goal is useful.\n\n44:09.520 --> 44:12.720\n Anything that impedes us, or we could say is valuable,\n\n44:12.720 --> 44:16.200\n anything that impedes us is actually obstructing to value.\n\n44:16.200 --> 44:19.160\n And anything that's irrelevant is just valueless.\n\n44:19.160 --> 44:23.880\n So this table that we're using right now,\n\n44:23.880 --> 44:26.360\n like this is an accessory to UNI\n\n44:26.360 --> 44:27.480\n because it's holding this paper\n\n44:27.480 --> 44:28.480\n that's holding the information\n\n44:28.480 --> 44:30.320\n that's guiding our conversation.\n\n44:30.320 --> 44:34.320\n But we could pay someone $100 to jump over this table.\n\n44:34.320 --> 44:37.080\n And this table could simultaneously be an accessory to UNI\n\n44:37.080 --> 44:39.500\n and an obstacle to someone else.\n\n44:39.500 --> 44:43.880\n So it's this domain, this silent contention of willpower\n\n44:43.880 --> 44:46.740\n and agendas occurring across the face of the earth\n\n44:46.740 --> 44:50.040\n that is what Austrian economics really looks at.\n\n44:50.040 --> 44:54.040\n It's the realm of human action, as they call it.\n\n44:54.040 --> 44:55.560\n It's called praxeology.\n\n44:55.560 --> 44:58.560\n So it's a non materialist viewpoint on reality\n\n44:58.560 --> 45:03.200\n and that things, we think in terms of matter being reality,\n\n45:03.200 --> 45:06.160\n but it's often more so in the sphere of human action,\n\n45:06.160 --> 45:08.620\n what matters, that is reality.\n\n45:08.620 --> 45:10.240\n It's the relevance of a thing\n\n45:10.240 --> 45:12.400\n to the course of one's goal directed action.\n\n45:12.400 --> 45:15.960\n And that's ultimately exists in the space of ideas.\n\n45:15.960 --> 45:16.940\n Yes.\n\n45:16.940 --> 45:19.040\n Not in the space of physical matter.\n\n45:19.040 --> 45:20.400\n And just to jump back to this line here,\n\n45:20.400 --> 45:24.620\n I think his fundamental line here is the question is,\n\n45:24.620 --> 45:26.880\n talking about universal Darwinism as an asset,\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:28.360\n what does it leave behind?\n\n45:28.360 --> 45:30.760\n I've tried to show that once it passes through everything,\n\n45:30.760 --> 45:32.920\n we're left with stronger, sounder versions\n\n45:32.920 --> 45:35.320\n of our most useful ideas.\n\n45:35.320 --> 45:36.520\n That's the key point to me.\n\n45:36.520 --> 45:40.400\n And that ideas and information, so far as we can tell,\n\n45:40.400 --> 45:43.260\n are the most fundamental substrate of reality.\n\n45:44.360 --> 45:47.560\n And information itself, back to entropy,\n\n45:47.560 --> 45:50.320\n information is the resolution of entropy.\n\n45:50.320 --> 45:51.560\n That's what the bit is, right?\n\n45:51.560 --> 45:52.440\n It's a one or a zero.\n\n45:52.440 --> 45:55.040\n Whatever reduces your entropy by half is a bit.\n\n45:55.040 --> 45:57.480\n And we measure information in bits.\n\n45:57.480 --> 45:58.640\n So.\n\n45:58.640 --> 45:59.760\n And you're right.\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:01.980\n People don't have ideas, ideas have people.\n\n46:02.840 --> 46:05.800\n Honestly, it's a really profound idea\n\n46:07.080 --> 46:11.620\n or a statement about reality, a reframing of reality.\n\n46:13.160 --> 46:15.320\n If we're actually being deeply honest about it,\n\n46:15.320 --> 46:17.240\n it's quite painful.\n\n46:17.240 --> 46:19.280\n I do appreciate that you defended\n\n46:19.280 --> 46:21.760\n your biological meatbag earlier,\n\n46:21.760 --> 46:26.020\n but it seems like ideas are the things that have power.\n\n46:26.020 --> 46:31.040\n That me, Lex, for example, is worthless.\n\n46:31.040 --> 46:35.820\n And relative to the ideas that used my brain\n\n46:35.820 --> 46:37.600\n for a bit of a time.\n\n46:37.600 --> 46:40.800\n But so far as we know, only human beings\n\n46:40.800 --> 46:42.400\n can generate and share ideas.\n\n46:42.400 --> 46:44.440\n So you can't say Lex is worthless.\n\n46:44.440 --> 46:47.960\n Like you are the node of the idea sphere.\n\n46:47.960 --> 46:49.080\n I'm the newest fear.\n\n46:49.080 --> 46:49.920\n So.\n\n46:51.120 --> 46:52.040\n What is it?\n\n46:52.040 --> 46:55.160\n From a Bitcoin perspective, I'm like, I'm mining.\n\n46:55.160 --> 46:59.000\n I'm solving the cryptographic problem and generate.\n\n47:01.040 --> 47:03.200\n In that sense, I'm a useful node.\n\n47:03.200 --> 47:06.560\n Yeah, you're competing to solve the puzzle of entropy,\n\n47:06.560 --> 47:07.400\n right?\n\n47:07.400 --> 47:09.620\n And when you do solve it, it benefits the entire network.\n\n47:09.620 --> 47:13.320\n But I guess from my perspective,\n\n47:13.320 --> 47:15.400\n just because just working in AI,\n\n47:15.400 --> 47:17.600\n I'm looking at the longterm vision.\n\n47:17.600 --> 47:22.500\n I see us humans and AI systems as really the same\n\n47:22.500 --> 47:25.000\n and AI systems ultimately as something\n\n47:25.000 --> 47:27.120\n that supersedes humans.\n\n47:27.120 --> 47:28.620\n So what is intelligence?\n\n47:33.360 --> 47:36.780\n So in the context of our current discussion,\n\n47:36.780 --> 47:41.080\n I think intelligence is very closely linked\n\n47:41.080 --> 47:45.340\n to this notion of ideas.\n\n47:45.340 --> 47:48.560\n And it's the ability to generate ideas,\n\n47:48.560 --> 47:53.560\n to mold ideas, to compress seeming chaos\n\n47:54.600 --> 47:58.680\n into some model, into some theory\n\n47:58.680 --> 48:01.440\n that efficiently compresses the chaos\n\n48:01.440 --> 48:04.880\n in a way where you can then integrate it with other ideas\n\n48:04.880 --> 48:07.080\n and they can play and all those kinds of things.\n\n48:07.080 --> 48:11.840\n So in that sense, it's the turning chaos into order.\n\n48:11.840 --> 48:15.720\n It's the molding of ideas such that our human brains\n\n48:15.720 --> 48:17.840\n can work with it.\n\n48:17.840 --> 48:19.600\n And just from my perspective,\n\n48:19.600 --> 48:22.880\n I don't see any reason why that can not be algorithmatized,\n\n48:22.880 --> 48:25.580\n converted into computational systems.\n\n48:25.580 --> 48:27.220\n I would agree.\n\n48:27.220 --> 48:28.220\n Which is scary.\n\n48:29.240 --> 48:33.400\n Scary or potentially really promising, right?\n\n48:33.400 --> 48:34.820\n It's kind of the case of all novelty.\n\n48:34.820 --> 48:37.160\n It's terrifying as much as it is promising.\n\n48:37.160 --> 48:39.440\n That's why you're pursuing it so heavily.\n\n48:39.440 --> 48:42.520\n I would maybe take it a step further\n\n48:42.520 --> 48:44.720\n and say that intelligence\n\n48:44.720 --> 48:47.360\n in maybe its most simplistic form is error correction.\n\n48:48.260 --> 48:53.260\n So we, humans have wants.\n\n48:53.300 --> 48:56.240\n Again, we're constantly expressing our value through action.\n\n48:56.240 --> 48:58.000\n There's no other way to express it by the way.\n\n48:58.000 --> 49:00.380\n It's whatever you choose to do in any moment,\n\n49:00.380 --> 49:02.280\n you are expressing the values you hold\n\n49:02.280 --> 49:03.680\n in your mind and your heart.\n\n49:03.680 --> 49:08.680\n So as we move from less valued A to more valued B,\n\n49:12.120 --> 49:16.160\n entropy happens, uncertainty happens, we fall off course.\n\n49:16.160 --> 49:19.320\n And it is intelligence that enables us\n\n49:19.320 --> 49:21.680\n to render information from that experience\n\n49:21.680 --> 49:23.720\n and error correct, right?\n\n49:23.720 --> 49:25.920\n So that we can move slightly,\n\n49:25.920 --> 49:29.120\n shift our trajectory slightly more towards B\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:30.860\n that we're trying to move towards.\n\n49:30.860 --> 49:35.600\n So I think that there's something there\n\n49:35.600 --> 49:40.600\n that I don't know that we can make synthetically.\n\n49:41.840 --> 49:45.800\n And that if we define intelligence as error correction,\n\n49:45.800 --> 49:47.120\n it's like error correction to what?\n\n49:47.120 --> 49:50.600\n It's error correction towards what we find is valuable.\n\n49:50.600 --> 49:52.560\n So we're trying to satisfy human wants.\n\n49:52.560 --> 49:54.240\n Might not just be our own, could be others as well.\n\n49:54.240 --> 49:55.080\n If I'm an entrepreneur,\n\n49:55.080 --> 49:57.560\n I'm trying to solve the wants of others, not just myself.\n\n49:57.560 --> 50:01.400\n And I'm trying to error correct myself towards that goal,\n\n50:01.400 --> 50:04.680\n using intelligence and processing environmental feedback\n\n50:04.680 --> 50:06.560\n through intelligence to error correct.\n\n50:06.560 --> 50:08.040\n So I don't know how,\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:12.440\n if you eliminate the human element completely,\n\n50:12.440 --> 50:13.940\n who's doing the wanting, right?\n\n50:13.940 --> 50:15.320\n Where does value come from?\n\n50:15.320 --> 50:18.240\n I know the machine learning people who are listening\n\n50:18.240 --> 50:20.280\n are saying that's exactly what machine learning is,\n\n50:20.280 --> 50:21.480\n which is error correction\n\n50:21.480 --> 50:24.060\n because you have a loss function, objective function\n\n50:24.060 --> 50:28.320\n that measures how wrong your thing is\n\n50:28.320 --> 50:30.240\n and you wanna make it less wrong next time.\n\n50:30.240 --> 50:32.000\n That's the whole process of machine learning.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:35.560\n But you're saying what humans are able to do\n\n50:35.560 --> 50:40.560\n is in a world where there's no maybe objective values,\n\n50:42.280 --> 50:46.480\n absolute values, you're generating that very loss function,\n\n50:46.480 --> 50:51.480\n that objective function that measures the error\n\n50:51.480 --> 50:55.120\n comes from the human mind.\n\n50:55.120 --> 50:57.240\n Some aliens might disagree with you\n\n50:57.240 --> 51:00.040\n because they might have a different objective function.\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:02.800\n Obviously, the purpose comes from consciousness, I think.\n\n51:02.800 --> 51:05.560\n And without purpose, there's not error correction.\n\n51:05.560 --> 51:08.000\n Yeah, I mean, this is again, a hypothesis.\n\n51:08.000 --> 51:09.560\n Like where does purpose come from?\n\n51:09.560 --> 51:12.000\n It seems to come from consciousness, you're right.\n\n51:13.160 --> 51:15.160\n That's where suffering comes from\n\n51:15.160 --> 51:17.060\n and you want to lessen suffering.\n\n51:18.160 --> 51:20.120\n That's where pleasure comes from.\n\n51:20.120 --> 51:21.920\n It seems like it's consciousness.\n\n51:21.920 --> 51:25.160\n Maybe there's something to this biological meat bag.\n\n51:25.160 --> 51:27.320\n So to take it one layer deeper on this\n\n51:27.320 --> 51:29.120\n and the reason I like this book so much,\n\n51:29.120 --> 51:30.720\n again, The Case Against Reality.\n\n51:31.660 --> 51:33.600\n So he's making the case that space and time\n\n51:33.600 --> 51:35.200\n are not fundamental.\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:36.040\n Yes.\n\n51:36.040 --> 51:39.260\n Which I started my intellectual explorations in physics,\n\n51:39.260 --> 51:40.180\n actually astrophysics.\n\n51:40.180 --> 51:42.660\n So for the longest time, even the way I describe money\n\n51:42.660 --> 51:46.560\n as I talk about space and time, so that blew my mind.\n\n51:46.560 --> 51:49.960\n But this dovetailed nicely with another book called Lila.\n\n51:51.440 --> 51:53.400\n The author is Robert Persig.\n\n51:53.400 --> 51:55.560\n So he wrote Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\n\n51:55.560 --> 51:57.280\n which is a very popular book.\n\n51:57.280 --> 52:00.120\n 20 years later, he wrote Lila, which no one's heard of,\n\n52:00.120 --> 52:01.400\n which is crazy.\n\n52:01.400 --> 52:03.920\n And he basically says he was wrong about his first book.\n\n52:03.920 --> 52:08.400\n And he lays out this entire other metaphysics of quality,\n\n52:08.400 --> 52:09.240\n he calls it.\n\n52:09.240 --> 52:12.480\n So it's the metaphysics, I think it's metaphysics of quality.\n\n52:12.480 --> 52:17.480\n But his supposition is that it's not physical reality\n\n52:18.080 --> 52:19.040\n that's fundamental.\n\n52:19.040 --> 52:22.240\n It's not informational information that's fundamental,\n\n52:22.240 --> 52:23.220\n it's value.\n\n52:24.240 --> 52:26.960\n So he actually, and it's a beautiful book,\n\n52:26.960 --> 52:28.340\n I highly recommend it.\n\n52:29.200 --> 52:33.180\n He essentially is refuting causality itself.\n\n52:33.180 --> 52:34.960\n We think A causes B.\n\n52:34.960 --> 52:41.960\n This book makes the case that B values precondition A,\n\n52:42.580 --> 52:45.980\n so that we are actually creating our future\n\n52:45.980 --> 52:48.420\n through our value systems.\n\n52:48.420 --> 52:50.900\n And this goes back to something,\n\n52:50.900 --> 52:52.260\n I think Solzhenitsyn said this,\n\n52:52.260 --> 52:54.300\n that the line between good and evil\n\n52:54.300 --> 52:56.220\n runs down the heart of every man.\n\n52:56.220 --> 52:58.940\n So it's as if our moral decisions\n\n52:58.940 --> 53:01.500\n are actually what's creating the outcomes\n\n53:01.500 --> 53:03.260\n in reality over time.\n\n53:03.260 --> 53:05.500\n And then that gets into all the wisdom traditions\n\n53:05.500 --> 53:06.620\n related to religion,\n\n53:06.620 --> 53:10.180\n where it's always talking about loving thy neighbor\n\n53:10.180 --> 53:12.380\n and loving God and all of these other things\n\n53:12.380 --> 53:15.260\n that are good morally to create the best outcomes.\n\n53:15.260 --> 53:17.840\n So values are fundamental.\n\n53:17.840 --> 53:19.260\n Value, yes.\n\n53:19.260 --> 53:21.340\n Value is fundamental.\n\n53:22.300 --> 53:24.100\n Oh boy, yeah, that's interesting.\n\n53:26.940 --> 53:30.140\n It does feel like physics is not capturing something.\n\n53:30.140 --> 53:35.140\n You know, there's some people, panpsychists argue\n\n53:35.500 --> 53:38.300\n that consciousness might be one of the fundamental\n\n53:38.300 --> 53:39.620\n properties of nature,\n\n53:39.620 --> 53:42.820\n like from which emerges everything we see.\n\n53:42.820 --> 53:46.420\n So that could be just other words\n\n53:46.420 --> 53:49.420\n for this same notion of value.\n\n53:49.420 --> 53:51.700\n And then the basic laws of physics\n\n53:51.700 --> 53:54.020\n are not capturing that currently.\n\n53:54.020 --> 53:56.500\n So maybe humans, in order to understand\n\n53:56.500 --> 53:57.820\n from where humans came from,\n\n53:57.820 --> 54:00.580\n we have to understand these other properties of nature,\n\n54:00.580 --> 54:03.500\n which are yet to be discovered at the physics level.\n\n54:03.500 --> 54:08.140\n And it's, we contend with that underlying nature,\n\n54:08.140 --> 54:10.760\n whatever it is, with the logos, right?\n\n54:10.760 --> 54:15.760\n So we're looking at uncategorized nature\n\n54:16.220 --> 54:18.540\n and then we're assigning a word to it.\n\n54:18.540 --> 54:23.260\n So we're slicing up chaos into little boxes of order.\n\n54:23.260 --> 54:25.740\n And then we're establishing this social consensus\n\n54:25.740 --> 54:28.860\n as to those labels, which we'd call words.\n\n54:28.860 --> 54:30.780\n And we're using that to communicate.\n\n54:30.780 --> 54:32.180\n And when we communicate,\n\n54:33.820 --> 54:35.260\n we can start to build these other things.\n\n54:35.260 --> 54:37.980\n This is like the Yuval Harari imagined orders.\n\n54:37.980 --> 54:41.060\n So we can create these useful fictions, right?\n\n54:41.060 --> 54:44.060\n Whether it's the nation state or human rights or money.\n\n54:44.060 --> 54:48.580\n And that allows us to cooperate flexibly in large numbers\n\n54:48.580 --> 54:50.500\n so that we can better contend with reality.\n\n54:50.500 --> 54:53.720\n We can produce more complicated things.\n\n54:53.720 --> 54:58.380\n We can enlarge that bubble of civilization against entropy.\n\n54:58.380 --> 55:01.100\n And that's what capitalism is all about.\n\n55:01.100 --> 55:04.520\n It's about further specializing knowledge,\n\n55:04.520 --> 55:07.500\n further enriching mankind's treasury of knowledge\n\n55:08.700 --> 55:09.580\n and doing it.\n\n55:09.580 --> 55:14.240\n But to do that, the communication media that we're using,\n\n55:14.240 --> 55:16.780\n the words have to have stable meaning.\n\n55:16.780 --> 55:21.540\n The money needs to have value that's dependable, right?\n\n55:21.540 --> 55:25.600\n It needs to be something that's, it's not dictated\n\n55:25.600 --> 55:26.920\n by any one group.\n\n55:26.920 --> 55:30.620\n It's reached by consensus of the entire group.\n\n55:30.620 --> 55:35.580\n That's how, so you could think it's like optimizing\n\n55:35.580 --> 55:36.760\n for error correction again,\n\n55:36.760 --> 55:39.980\n where a free market would be harnessing the intelligence\n\n55:39.980 --> 55:43.860\n of all market actors and a central planning\n\n55:43.860 --> 55:46.020\n or essentially planned market would be harnessing\n\n55:46.020 --> 55:49.860\n just the intelligence of a small group of bureaucrats.\n\n55:49.860 --> 55:51.620\n And it's not obvious how to achieve this kind\n\n55:51.620 --> 55:53.460\n of consensus mechanism.\n\n55:53.460 --> 55:56.780\n I mean, there's obviously, we'll talk about sort of Bitcoin\n\n55:56.780 --> 55:57.880\n as an idea.\n\n55:57.880 --> 56:01.900\n Ultimately, the idea of Bitcoin is connecting it to physics.\n\n56:02.860 --> 56:07.740\n So like, you can trust that physical matter won't change.\n\n56:09.060 --> 56:12.940\n But, you know, there could be other ideas that we get.\n\n56:12.940 --> 56:14.660\n Maybe physics could be changed.\n\n56:14.660 --> 56:17.420\n If Eric Weinstein has anything to say about it.\n\n56:17.420 --> 56:19.980\n Like it's, you know, we right now believe\n\n56:19.980 --> 56:21.580\n that physics can't be changed.\n\n56:21.580 --> 56:24.460\n The physical matter of the world, but maybe it can\n\n56:24.460 --> 56:26.480\n in a way that we're totally not understanding.\n\n56:26.480 --> 56:28.460\n You mentioned sort of reality\n\n56:28.460 --> 56:32.460\n from Donald Hoffman's perspective.\n\n56:32.460 --> 56:35.440\n Like if we don't have even close to direct access\n\n56:35.440 --> 56:39.600\n to the fabric of reality, maybe we're living in a world\n\n56:39.600 --> 56:42.420\n that's very like many dimensions,\n\n56:42.420 --> 56:45.180\n that the notions of space and time is just like a silly,\n\n56:45.180 --> 56:48.480\n useful construct that's not at all connected.\n\n56:48.480 --> 56:51.020\n You're starting to look at like Stephen Wolframs.\n\n56:51.020 --> 56:53.500\n I don't know if you're familiar with this view\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:57.140\n of the world that it's like hypergraphs underneath it all.\n\n56:57.140 --> 56:58.660\n Like these mathematical structures\n\n56:58.660 --> 57:00.460\n from which everything emerges.\n\n57:00.460 --> 57:05.460\n Like they're like many, many, many orders of magnitude,\n\n57:07.380 --> 57:10.140\n smaller than what we think of.\n\n57:10.140 --> 57:13.240\n They're even smaller than like strings and string theory.\n\n57:13.240 --> 57:15.300\n So like those are the basic mathematical objects\n\n57:15.300 --> 57:16.540\n from which it emerges.\n\n57:16.540 --> 57:17.620\n I don't, you know,\n\n57:17.620 --> 57:20.540\n I think that's an interesting philosophical framework.\n\n57:20.540 --> 57:25.340\n It's also, people should check out a cool way to play\n\n57:25.340 --> 57:27.700\n with beautiful hypergraph mathematical structures.\n\n57:27.700 --> 57:30.040\n So he has, I don't know if you know who Stephen Wolfram is,\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:34.240\n but he created Wolfram Alpha and all these tools\n\n57:34.240 --> 57:36.360\n that you can actually visualize and play with.\n\n57:36.360 --> 57:39.280\n So you can play with physics in a visual way,\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:43.540\n which, or at least discrete mathematics,\n\n57:43.540 --> 57:45.060\n which I think is incredible.\n\n57:45.060 --> 57:46.820\n He doesn't get enough love.\n\n57:46.820 --> 57:50.420\n One of the reasons he, I think doesn't get enough love\n\n57:50.420 --> 57:53.360\n is because of this little quirk of human nature,\n\n57:53.360 --> 57:54.780\n which is the ego.\n\n57:55.700 --> 57:59.860\n And he sometimes frustrates a few folks\n\n57:59.860 --> 58:03.980\n because he's very, let's say proud of his work.\n\n58:03.980 --> 58:04.820\n I guess.\n\n58:04.820 --> 58:09.820\n But it's interesting to think about a world\n\n58:10.380 --> 58:13.580\n where we don't have direct access to reality,\n\n58:13.580 --> 58:14.980\n as Hoffman argues.\n\n58:14.980 --> 58:17.300\n And maybe, I don't know if you can comment.\n\n58:17.300 --> 58:19.380\n I don't know if you're familiar with Ayn Rand's work\n\n58:19.380 --> 58:21.980\n and her whole philosophy of objectivism\n\n58:21.980 --> 58:25.700\n or her whole contention is that, you know,\n\n58:25.700 --> 58:27.040\n we do have access.\n\n58:28.360 --> 58:29.420\n I don't want to misstate it,\n\n58:29.420 --> 58:33.220\n but at least she would claim\n\n58:33.220 --> 58:38.220\n that it's not useful,\n\n58:39.180 --> 58:41.600\n or I think she would probably say it's not correct\n\n58:41.600 --> 58:44.220\n to argue that we don't have access to reality.\n\n58:44.220 --> 58:46.060\n We have, hence, objectivism.\n\n58:46.060 --> 58:49.140\n We have direct access to reality.\n\n58:49.140 --> 58:52.380\n That's the only thing we can reason about.\n\n58:52.380 --> 58:55.120\n And the only way to live life morally\n\n58:55.120 --> 58:57.740\n is to reason through everything,\n\n58:57.740 --> 58:59.620\n starting with the axioms of reality,\n\n58:59.620 --> 59:02.060\n which we do have direct access to.\n\n59:02.060 --> 59:04.580\n Do you have thoughts about her work?\n\n59:04.580 --> 59:08.900\n I am slightly ashamed to say I have not read Ayn Rand yet.\n\n59:08.900 --> 59:10.500\n So she is high on my list\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:13.300\n and she's been recommended a number of times.\n\n59:14.700 --> 59:16.260\n So I don't know a lot specifically\n\n59:16.260 --> 59:18.300\n about her philosophy or objectivism,\n\n59:18.300 --> 59:21.620\n but to me, it resonates closely\n\n59:21.620 --> 59:25.780\n with what the American pragmatist commented on truth.\n\n59:25.780 --> 59:28.140\n And they distinguished what you could say\n\n59:28.140 --> 59:31.300\n is absolute truth, which is at the bottom of reality,\n\n59:31.300 --> 59:34.340\n whether it's Mr. Wolfram's mathematical formulas or value,\n\n59:34.340 --> 59:37.020\n whatever it may be, it's something ineffable,\n\n59:37.020 --> 59:41.420\n something beyond the reach of epistemology, perhaps even.\n\n59:42.340 --> 59:45.580\n And maybe that's why religion just sort of points to it.\n\n59:45.580 --> 59:50.060\n It's trying to use, I think Joseph Campbell said something\n\n59:50.060 --> 59:55.060\n like religion is using stories\n\n59:55.700 --> 59:58.460\n to point towards the same transcendental mystery\n\n59:58.460 --> 1:00:01.220\n we all experience but cannot articulate.\n\n1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:03.180\n So something like the artist,\n\n1:00:03.180 --> 1:00:06.820\n the artist uses lies to point to the truth,\n\n1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:08.980\n something like that, that kind of thing.\n\n1:00:10.140 --> 1:00:10.980\n That's really good.\n\n1:00:10.980 --> 1:00:13.700\n But the American pragmatist said that,\n\n1:00:13.700 --> 1:00:16.300\n because at the end of the day, this is all about,\n\n1:00:16.300 --> 1:00:18.580\n when we say truth, we need something\n\n1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:23.420\n that is close to social consensus\n\n1:00:23.420 --> 1:00:25.980\n and is not shakable by political action.\n\n1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.380\n So that's what physics and mathematics are.\n\n1:00:28.380 --> 1:00:33.380\n It's an unshakable point of reference,\n\n1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:35.140\n I guess you might say.\n\n1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:39.420\n So the American pragmatist defined truth\n\n1:00:39.420 --> 1:00:41.180\n as the end of inquiry.\n\n1:00:42.460 --> 1:00:47.460\n And in markets, we could say that the market itself\n\n1:00:48.420 --> 1:00:50.620\n is a forum that generates truth.\n\n1:00:50.620 --> 1:00:51.940\n We call this pragmatic truth\n\n1:00:51.940 --> 1:00:53.940\n to separate pure objective truth\n\n1:00:53.940 --> 1:00:56.580\n that we can't even talk about without polluting it\n\n1:00:56.580 --> 1:00:57.700\n versus pragmatic truth,\n\n1:00:57.700 --> 1:00:59.340\n which is something that's useful.\n\n1:00:59.340 --> 1:01:01.940\n So the example here would be,\n\n1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:05.580\n if I give you a map and you're trying to go\n\n1:01:05.580 --> 1:01:09.060\n from your house to the local brisket restaurant,\n\n1:01:09.060 --> 1:01:10.780\n and the map gets you from your house\n\n1:01:10.780 --> 1:01:12.420\n to the brisket restaurant,\n\n1:01:12.420 --> 1:01:13.940\n is that because the map is true\n\n1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:15.700\n or is that because the map is useful?\n\n1:01:16.740 --> 1:01:18.620\n They're very hard to disentangle\n\n1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:21.420\n when you're just looking at it pragmatically.\n\n1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:23.900\n And in markets, markets, I argue,\n\n1:01:23.900 --> 1:01:26.460\n generate three forms of pragmatic truth.\n\n1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:28.420\n One is the price.\n\n1:01:28.420 --> 1:01:33.420\n So this is the collective subjective demand\n\n1:01:33.420 --> 1:01:35.860\n and purchasing power of humanity\n\n1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:39.860\n running up against the objective supply of capital\n\n1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:41.820\n and resources in the marketplace.\n\n1:01:41.820 --> 1:01:44.380\n So there's demand overlaid on supply.\n\n1:01:44.380 --> 1:01:46.060\n The result of that is the price.\n\n1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:51.060\n So that is the most truthful exchange ratio,\n\n1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:54.180\n which is the closest approximation to the value\n\n1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:56.100\n of any good in the marketplace.\n\n1:01:56.100 --> 1:01:58.660\n So it gives us a data point on which we can operate.\n\n1:01:58.660 --> 1:02:01.420\n It's compressing all known market realities\n\n1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:03.860\n down into a single actionable number.\n\n1:02:03.860 --> 1:02:05.980\n You know, based on the price of bread or copper,\n\n1:02:05.980 --> 1:02:07.580\n whether you wanna buy more of it,\n\n1:02:07.580 --> 1:02:09.060\n you wanna abstain from buying it,\n\n1:02:09.060 --> 1:02:11.420\n or maybe you wanna try and find substitutes.\n\n1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:13.940\n And you can think of that price signal,\n\n1:02:13.940 --> 1:02:15.580\n it's like an economic nerve signal.\n\n1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:17.620\n It's coordinating human action across time.\n\n1:02:17.620 --> 1:02:22.620\n So if we're one socioeconomic superorganism or collective,\n\n1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:24.620\n that the price signal is the nerve.\n\n1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:27.060\n And that's the first form of pragmatic truth\n\n1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:28.460\n that markets generate.\n\n1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:32.300\n The second form would be tools and innovations themselves.\n\n1:02:32.300 --> 1:02:35.700\n So entrepreneurs are experimenting across time.\n\n1:02:35.700 --> 1:02:37.700\n They're trying to satisfy the wants of consumers.\n\n1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.540\n Consumers are sovereign in the marketplace.\n\n1:02:40.540 --> 1:02:43.940\n Whatever the consumer wants, the consumer gets, right?\n\n1:02:43.940 --> 1:02:44.980\n I'm trying to satisfy that.\n\n1:02:44.980 --> 1:02:46.460\n I'm trying to do it at a profit.\n\n1:02:46.460 --> 1:02:49.740\n So I'm trying to take viewing the existing price signals\n\n1:02:49.740 --> 1:02:50.700\n of goods in the marketplace.\n\n1:02:50.700 --> 1:02:53.260\n I'm trying to assemble those in a way\n\n1:02:53.260 --> 1:02:55.780\n at a cost lower than the final solution\n\n1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:57.380\n I'm delivering to my customer.\n\n1:02:57.380 --> 1:02:58.700\n I'm selling it at a price higher\n\n1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:01.380\n than the productive factors I combined to create it.\n\n1:03:02.820 --> 1:03:05.100\n And in that iterative process,\n\n1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.980\n we're constantly discovering new and better ways\n\n1:03:08.980 --> 1:03:11.420\n of solving problems or satisfying the wants.\n\n1:03:11.420 --> 1:03:14.900\n So we could say, to go out and dig a hole, right?\n\n1:03:14.900 --> 1:03:16.540\n Someone wants a hole dug,\n\n1:03:16.540 --> 1:03:20.260\n that a shovel is gonna let you do it much faster per hour\n\n1:03:20.260 --> 1:03:22.460\n than you would with your bare hands.\n\n1:03:22.460 --> 1:03:24.900\n So what is the pragmatic truth of digging holes?\n\n1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:27.380\n It's a shovel, right?\n\n1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:30.020\n It's the best way we know how to solve\n\n1:03:30.020 --> 1:03:33.020\n any particular problem based on\n\n1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:35.340\n the existing treasury of knowledge.\n\n1:03:35.340 --> 1:03:39.140\n So every tool, again, we're back to ideas being fundamental.\n\n1:03:39.140 --> 1:03:42.980\n The shovel itself is just a knowledge structure.\n\n1:03:42.980 --> 1:03:45.620\n We've figured out a way to create this particular implement\n\n1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:47.780\n and then we've indexed the raw materials\n\n1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:49.980\n we found in nature to this knowledge structure\n\n1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.220\n to create a shovel,\n\n1:03:51.220 --> 1:03:54.220\n which allows us to better satisfy human wants\n\n1:03:55.940 --> 1:03:57.260\n faster, cheaper, better, effectively.\n\n1:03:57.260 --> 1:03:59.460\n I'm trying to generalize,\n\n1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:01.220\n you're blowing my mind a little bit here.\n\n1:04:01.220 --> 1:04:03.660\n I'm trying to generalize the idea of tool\n\n1:04:03.660 --> 1:04:04.780\n to how to think about it.\n\n1:04:04.780 --> 1:04:07.780\n Cause I keep just, when you say tool,\n\n1:04:07.780 --> 1:04:09.580\n I keep imagining different tools,\n\n1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:12.220\n like specific instantiations of a tool.\n\n1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:16.100\n I'm trying to see, so the price is a pragmatic truth\n\n1:04:16.100 --> 1:04:21.100\n that's communicating value in this network.\n\n1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:26.660\n Subjective demands against objective supply.\n\n1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:27.500\n Subjective.\n\n1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:29.260\n So it's an economic democracy.\n\n1:04:29.260 --> 1:04:30.100\n Got it.\n\n1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:32.260\n So that's the demand supply.\n\n1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:35.460\n And then the tools are the ways of extracting\n\n1:04:36.380 --> 1:04:39.500\n or solving problems is the more general kind of thing.\n\n1:04:39.500 --> 1:04:40.860\n Or satisfying wants.\n\n1:04:40.860 --> 1:04:42.740\n Satisfying wants.\n\n1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:46.980\n So wants are somehow, that's part of the supply\n\n1:04:46.980 --> 1:04:48.060\n and the demand.\n\n1:04:48.060 --> 1:04:49.900\n And wants are back to value, right?\n\n1:04:49.900 --> 1:04:51.140\n Cause everything someone wants,\n\n1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:53.180\n they're expressing their value.\n\n1:04:53.180 --> 1:04:54.020\n Okay.\n\n1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:54.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:54.860 --> 1:04:57.460\n So the shovel is a pragmatic truth.\n\n1:04:57.460 --> 1:04:58.860\n The shovel is truth.\n\n1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:00.540\n It feels like a good book title.\n\n1:05:00.540 --> 1:05:01.380\n Okay, sorry.\n\n1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:03.220\n So what other pragma, what is it?\n\n1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:08.220\n And then the third one I would argue is virtue actually.\n\n1:05:08.540 --> 1:05:09.740\n Oh wow.\n\n1:05:09.740 --> 1:05:13.340\n And another way to maybe think about this\n\n1:05:13.340 --> 1:05:14.740\n is competitive competency,\n\n1:05:14.740 --> 1:05:17.140\n but it's also cooperative competency.\n\n1:05:17.140 --> 1:05:20.740\n So we're learning over time what characteristics,\n\n1:05:20.740 --> 1:05:24.780\n what patterns of action, what mindsets,\n\n1:05:24.780 --> 1:05:27.980\n what mental tools, what heuristics are most useful\n\n1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.660\n to satisfying customer wants.\n\n1:05:30.660 --> 1:05:32.780\n So I think that becomes over time,\n\n1:05:32.780 --> 1:05:34.380\n becomes sharpened into virtue, right?\n\n1:05:34.380 --> 1:05:36.500\n Like we know it's best to be honest\n\n1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:39.340\n because if you lie, it's very energy inefficient, right?\n\n1:05:39.340 --> 1:05:41.700\n You're creating this little fork of reality.\n\n1:05:41.700 --> 1:05:43.460\n And then if someone else asks you about that lie again,\n\n1:05:43.460 --> 1:05:46.140\n you have to put another layer of lies on top of it.\n\n1:05:46.140 --> 1:05:47.220\n Where if you just tell the truth,\n\n1:05:47.220 --> 1:05:49.300\n you're just recollecting what happened.\n\n1:05:49.300 --> 1:05:50.860\n And so that sort of keeps,\n\n1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:55.620\n again, when we're talking about delaying volatility, right?\n\n1:05:55.620 --> 1:05:59.220\n If you lie, you're delaying short term volatility,\n\n1:05:59.220 --> 1:06:00.860\n but you're increasing longterm volatility.\n\n1:06:00.860 --> 1:06:01.700\n What about murder?\n\n1:06:01.700 --> 1:06:04.140\n I haven't been able to figure out why murder is bad\n\n1:06:04.140 --> 1:06:07.140\n because I just keep wanting to murder people.\n\n1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:08.300\n And I've murdered many.\n\n1:06:08.300 --> 1:06:09.660\n She's the one for that.\n\n1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:11.820\n Well, that's why I'm trying to get an interview\n\n1:06:11.820 --> 1:06:13.380\n with Vladimir Putin.\n\n1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:16.980\n So that's fascinating, virtue in this market\n\n1:06:16.980 --> 1:06:19.740\n with the supplies and demands, and there's the tools,\n\n1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:23.300\n which is also a pragmatic truth, and there's virtue.\n\n1:06:23.300 --> 1:06:24.980\n It's a pragmatic truth.\n\n1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:28.220\n Yeah, and if we interfere with that free market process,\n\n1:06:28.220 --> 1:06:31.340\n again, if we overstep, which this maybe ties into murder,\n\n1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:34.580\n if you start to be coercive against life,\n\n1:06:34.580 --> 1:06:35.980\n liberty or property,\n\n1:06:35.980 --> 1:06:38.900\n so if you're forcibly taking someone's life,\n\n1:06:38.900 --> 1:06:41.380\n you're breaking down the trust in that market\n\n1:06:41.380 --> 1:06:44.100\n that generates these pragmatic truths.\n\n1:06:44.100 --> 1:06:47.500\n If you forcibly infringe on someone's liberty, right?\n\n1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:52.260\n For any reason other than them originally breaking\n\n1:06:53.220 --> 1:06:55.060\n or infringing upon life, liberty or property,\n\n1:06:55.060 --> 1:06:56.860\n then that's not gonna work either.\n\n1:06:56.860 --> 1:06:59.340\n And then if you violate private property rights,\n\n1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:01.140\n if you steal property from others,\n\n1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:04.340\n you're breaking down the trust\n\n1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:08.780\n that the intersubjective fabric of money and markets\n\n1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:11.140\n and the rule of law, all of these useful fictions\n\n1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:12.140\n are meant to preserve,\n\n1:07:12.140 --> 1:07:14.780\n you're corrupting it and breaking it down.\n\n1:07:14.780 --> 1:07:16.500\n What's kind of interesting to think about the market\n\n1:07:16.500 --> 1:07:19.540\n as helping evolve the virtues.\n\n1:07:20.580 --> 1:07:22.980\n It's sharpened into virtues.\n\n1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:24.700\n And then these virtues can then go\n\n1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:26.300\n into motivational posters,\n\n1:07:27.380 --> 1:07:30.340\n or like in books that we all agree on,\n\n1:07:30.340 --> 1:07:32.740\n and then eventually take for granted\n\n1:07:32.740 --> 1:07:35.340\n as if they were somehow fundamental to human nature,\n\n1:07:35.340 --> 1:07:37.700\n but they're not perhaps fundamental,\n\n1:07:37.700 --> 1:07:39.460\n they're just pragmatic truths.\n\n1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:45.460\n Yeah, another way to consider competition itself\n\n1:07:45.580 --> 1:07:48.380\n is that it is a discovery process.\n\n1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:52.620\n So, you know, entrepreneurs are competing with one another\n\n1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:56.460\n and they're trying to best satisfy consumer wants\n\n1:07:56.460 --> 1:07:57.700\n at the lowest possible price.\n\n1:07:57.700 --> 1:08:00.460\n So they're placing bets of time, energy and capital\n\n1:08:00.460 --> 1:08:03.740\n on themselves, on their idea, their business plan.\n\n1:08:03.740 --> 1:08:06.420\n And then the market decides, right?\n\n1:08:06.420 --> 1:08:10.260\n The consensus of market actors decide which one was better.\n\n1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:11.780\n One lives, one dies.\n\n1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:16.900\n So competition itself is helping us get closer to truth,\n\n1:08:16.900 --> 1:08:18.060\n to pragmatic truth.\n\n1:08:18.060 --> 1:08:21.380\n So we're discovering what is the right price for this asset.\n\n1:08:21.380 --> 1:08:24.180\n And that price, by the way, it's derived,\n\n1:08:24.180 --> 1:08:26.500\n again, in the sense of data compression.\n\n1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:28.940\n Everyone in the world can see that price.\n\n1:08:28.940 --> 1:08:31.580\n Everyone in the world can then put their skin in the game\n\n1:08:31.580 --> 1:08:34.300\n by choosing to buy or sell or short or go long\n\n1:08:34.300 --> 1:08:37.380\n or do any number of financial actions on that price.\n\n1:08:38.220 --> 1:08:40.420\n And that information is then propagated back out\n\n1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:41.260\n to everyone else.\n\n1:08:41.260 --> 1:08:44.980\n So it's this feedback loop between market actor and price\n\n1:08:44.980 --> 1:08:48.100\n that makes it so useful.\n\n1:08:48.100 --> 1:08:52.500\n And that's what carries us,\n\n1:08:52.500 --> 1:08:56.060\n so it's these collisions of interest that carry us,\n\n1:08:56.060 --> 1:09:00.900\n it removes the unuseful aspects of ourselves\n\n1:09:00.900 --> 1:09:02.940\n or of our tools or of a price\n\n1:09:02.940 --> 1:09:05.420\n and reveals pragmatic truth to us.\n\n1:09:05.420 --> 1:09:08.220\n Can you play my therapist for a second?\n\n1:09:08.220 --> 1:09:11.300\n And if we talk about creative destruction,\n\n1:09:11.300 --> 1:09:13.340\n I think, not Bukowski,\n\n1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:17.460\n Hunter S. Thompson has a quote,\n\n1:09:17.460 --> 1:09:20.940\n something like, for all instances of beauty,\n\n1:09:20.940 --> 1:09:22.820\n many souls must be trampled.\n\n1:09:22.820 --> 1:09:25.060\n Wow.\n\n1:09:25.060 --> 1:09:30.060\n But there does seem to be an aspect of competition\n\n1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:36.500\n that destroys, you were talking about entrepreneurs\n\n1:09:36.500 --> 1:09:40.780\n sort of on the outside of the circle of order,\n\n1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:45.140\n striving to make sense, to compress volatility\n\n1:09:45.140 --> 1:09:47.860\n of the chaos of the universe.\n\n1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:52.860\n Is there some way to protect a little bit\n\n1:09:53.420 --> 1:09:55.380\n against the pain of that destruction\n\n1:09:55.380 --> 1:09:57.100\n or that creative destruction,\n\n1:09:57.100 --> 1:10:00.340\n that entrepreneur screaming on fire\n\n1:10:00.340 --> 1:10:03.660\n as he enlightens the rest of us,\n\n1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:06.740\n is there some role for us humans together\n\n1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:08.260\n in the togetherness of it?\n\n1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:15.060\n Also government, but any kind of collectives\n\n1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:18.300\n in helping that entrepreneur who's on fire\n\n1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:22.860\n maybe after a few minutes to spray him with some water\n\n1:10:22.860 --> 1:10:25.100\n and put him out of his misery?\n\n1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:31.460\n I would say that pain is the inarguable basis of being.\n\n1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:39.380\n Pain is, no matter how you try to explain it away\n\n1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:41.340\n or describe it,\n\n1:10:41.340 --> 1:10:46.340\n or it's not something you can rationalize away.\n\n1:10:46.980 --> 1:10:50.900\n No one, I think ever,\n\n1:10:50.900 --> 1:10:53.180\n someone may want to cut themselves to have an endorphin high\n\n1:10:53.180 --> 1:10:55.060\n but no one wants to suffer, we'd say, right?\n\n1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:56.980\n So pain in that sense,\n\n1:10:56.980 --> 1:10:59.580\n it is what we're constantly trying to deal with\n\n1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:04.780\n and to move away from or create buffers between us\n\n1:11:04.780 --> 1:11:07.620\n and potential pain or potential uncertainty.\n\n1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:10.900\n And that pain is information.\n\n1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:12.500\n When we experience something\n\n1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:16.100\n that is misfit to the outcome we desired,\n\n1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:17.820\n that pain is what puts us,\n\n1:11:17.820 --> 1:11:20.820\n it encourages us to change our trajectory\n\n1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:24.060\n to get back on course towards our valued aim.\n\n1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:29.060\n So as far as, you need entrepreneurs that are exploring,\n\n1:11:31.020 --> 1:11:32.340\n and you're trying to do something new,\n\n1:11:32.340 --> 1:11:33.860\n if you're a pioneer of any kind,\n\n1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:36.140\n you are courageously facing pain.\n\n1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:38.060\n You're willfully confronting it.\n\n1:11:38.060 --> 1:11:40.900\n So I don't think it's avoidable in that sense.\n\n1:11:40.900 --> 1:11:44.540\n It's not like we can have pain free economic growth\n\n1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:48.020\n like the central bank would maybe have us lend to believe\n\n1:11:48.020 --> 1:11:50.220\n that we can just run these experiments\n\n1:11:50.220 --> 1:11:51.060\n and when they fail,\n\n1:11:51.060 --> 1:11:52.900\n we'll just paper over all the losses and continue.\n\n1:11:52.900 --> 1:11:56.140\n Or you're just delaying and exacerbating\n\n1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:58.300\n the inevitable volatility back to reality.\n\n1:11:59.660 --> 1:12:02.660\n But what I would say is that capitalism,\n\n1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:03.820\n because we're building,\n\n1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:05.620\n we're increasing the capital stock of the world,\n\n1:12:05.620 --> 1:12:08.060\n which again, capital is the mitigation of risk.\n\n1:12:08.060 --> 1:12:10.420\n So we're reducing the overall risk of existence\n\n1:12:10.420 --> 1:12:12.580\n by accumulating more capital in the world.\n\n1:12:12.580 --> 1:12:14.900\n And that's what protects that entrepreneur\n\n1:12:14.900 --> 1:12:17.580\n that's deciding, hey, I saved up a million bucks.\n\n1:12:17.580 --> 1:12:20.100\n I'm gonna go try this business idea.\n\n1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:22.300\n I'm gonna put all my money on the line.\n\n1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:24.420\n And if he goes up in flames,\n\n1:12:24.420 --> 1:12:27.180\n then his cost of living when he comes back to reality\n\n1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:28.380\n and he's starting over from zero,\n\n1:12:28.380 --> 1:12:31.060\n his cost of living is substantially lower\n\n1:12:31.060 --> 1:12:33.700\n starting over from zero than it was in the past.\n\n1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:37.020\n So then he would be out in the wilderness on his own.\n\n1:12:37.020 --> 1:12:40.020\n So it's the accumulation of capital stock\n\n1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:43.300\n is the buffer against uncertainty for everyone.\n\n1:12:43.300 --> 1:12:47.060\n And it gives you actually more potential\n\n1:12:47.060 --> 1:12:48.420\n to go out and experiment,\n\n1:12:48.420 --> 1:12:51.180\n to go out and confront the chaos of nature\n\n1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:53.940\n because you are better healed effectively.\n\n1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:56.500\n So I think we're speaking\n\n1:12:58.980 --> 1:13:03.020\n in sort of idealistic terms about the power of capitals\n\n1:13:03.020 --> 1:13:04.740\n and when it works well.\n\n1:13:04.740 --> 1:13:07.020\n Is there any aspects that you think\n\n1:13:07.020 --> 1:13:10.500\n that don't work well in a free market\n\n1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:12.460\n in all the basic pragmatic truths\n\n1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:13.580\n that we were talking about?\n\n1:13:13.580 --> 1:13:15.540\n Is there ways it can go wrong?\n\n1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:21.900\n So I would first argue that we have never seen\n\n1:13:22.940 --> 1:13:25.500\n an actual purely free market.\n\n1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:30.500\n Closest example would be kind of geopolitically\n\n1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:35.740\n we have a free market\n\n1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:38.540\n and that governments are not necessarily governed\n\n1:13:41.580 --> 1:13:46.580\n but they are premised on governing large groups\n\n1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:47.620\n of individuals.\n\n1:13:47.620 --> 1:13:49.940\n So that's not, doesn't exactly.\n\n1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:52.100\n You mean between governments?\n\n1:13:52.100 --> 1:13:53.140\n Yes.\n\n1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:54.620\n See, but isn't there still,\n\n1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:57.780\n so a free market, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:13:57.780 --> 1:14:00.460\n is the free market still grounded in the ideas\n\n1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:03.980\n of property rights and all those kinds of things, right?\n\n1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:06.300\n So governments tend to also sometimes\n\n1:14:06.300 --> 1:14:07.820\n be violent towards each other.\n\n1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:08.660\n That's right.\n\n1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:11.820\n So they don't respect all the basic aspects of capitalism.\n\n1:14:11.820 --> 1:14:12.660\n That's right.\n\n1:14:12.660 --> 1:14:15.020\n So maybe another way to look at this is that\n\n1:14:15.020 --> 1:14:20.020\n gold is the original governor of government actually.\n\n1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:24.140\n And this is the reason governments have abused\n\n1:14:24.140 --> 1:14:26.980\n and gone off of the gold standard.\n\n1:14:26.980 --> 1:14:31.980\n So historically, if you are a bank or a nation state\n\n1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:37.820\n and you produce more currency\n\n1:14:37.820 --> 1:14:40.060\n than your gold reserves can justify,\n\n1:14:41.020 --> 1:14:43.860\n then gold will flow out of your bank\n\n1:14:43.860 --> 1:14:45.020\n or out of your country.\n\n1:14:45.020 --> 1:14:50.020\n So there's this natural check via the money\n\n1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:53.300\n that via capitalistic money, which is gold, right?\n\n1:14:53.300 --> 1:14:55.060\n Gold was selected by the free market.\n\n1:14:55.060 --> 1:14:57.460\n It's not decreed by government.\n\n1:14:57.460 --> 1:15:01.460\n It provided this natural check on government action.\n\n1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:06.460\n So my, I guess to get back to the original question is\n\n1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:10.580\n we've never seen a pure free market\n\n1:15:10.580 --> 1:15:13.780\n because money has always been monopolized\n\n1:15:15.100 --> 1:15:16.980\n and coerced, frankly.\n\n1:15:16.980 --> 1:15:20.780\n So to try and answer what goes wrong with a free market\n\n1:15:20.780 --> 1:15:23.580\n is really difficult because we've never actually seen it.\n\n1:15:23.580 --> 1:15:27.620\n And I would define free market is one\n\n1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:31.580\n in which government only protects life, liberty and property.\n\n1:15:31.580 --> 1:15:35.060\n And so that has a very minimal role in society.\n\n1:15:35.060 --> 1:15:37.340\n Again, just as network security\n\n1:15:37.340 --> 1:15:39.740\n for the economic trade network.\n\n1:15:39.740 --> 1:15:44.660\n And anything that, any government function that goes beyond\n\n1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:47.140\n those three core functions, which by the way,\n\n1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:49.540\n are pretty much the core tenants of morality as well.\n\n1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:52.340\n So government's just really intended to preserve,\n\n1:15:52.340 --> 1:15:55.060\n you know, natural law, if you will.\n\n1:15:55.060 --> 1:15:58.060\n Anything that goes beyond that is,\n\n1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:00.580\n moves us closer to an unfree market.\n\n1:16:00.580 --> 1:16:05.100\n So every regulation, every act of coercion\n\n1:16:05.100 --> 1:16:10.100\n is actually a gradation closer to a purely unfree market,\n\n1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:12.260\n which would be a monopoly.\n\n1:16:12.260 --> 1:16:15.980\n So in terms of what I guess theoretically we could say\n\n1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:20.220\n goes wrong in the free market is that it's volatile.\n\n1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:25.220\n It's trading off, it's accepting short term volatility\n\n1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:29.820\n in exchange for less long run volatility.\n\n1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:32.300\n And this tends to be the way of nature, by the way.\n\n1:16:32.300 --> 1:16:37.300\n So if we look at something like there's a region\n\n1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:40.300\n in North America called Baja, California,\n\n1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:43.660\n and it runs into the United States\n\n1:16:43.660 --> 1:16:45.420\n and it runs down into Mexico as well.\n\n1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:49.380\n So the same topology, but two different jurisdictions.\n\n1:16:50.340 --> 1:16:55.340\n In the US, we very heavily manage forest fires.\n\n1:16:55.580 --> 1:16:57.900\n We're trying to manage nature effectively.\n\n1:16:57.900 --> 1:16:59.980\n Whereas in Mexico is much more unregulated.\n\n1:16:59.980 --> 1:17:04.260\n It just, when wildfires spring up, they let them burn off.\n\n1:17:04.260 --> 1:17:06.220\n North America, when wildfires spring up,\n\n1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:08.140\n we're actually extinguishing them.\n\n1:17:08.140 --> 1:17:09.660\n So we're constantly trying to dampen\n\n1:17:09.660 --> 1:17:12.260\n the short run volatility of these small brush fires.\n\n1:17:12.260 --> 1:17:13.660\n Whereas in Mexico, we just let them burn.\n\n1:17:13.660 --> 1:17:15.500\n We let nature do its thing.\n\n1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.860\n The consequence of this is that the wildfires\n\n1:17:18.860 --> 1:17:21.260\n still occur eventually, but they're much larger\n\n1:17:21.260 --> 1:17:23.140\n and much more devastating in North America\n\n1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:25.180\n where human intervention has occurred\n\n1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:30.180\n because it's dampening nature's natural corrective mechanism\n\n1:17:31.820 --> 1:17:34.620\n of clearing this underbrush with these more frequent\n\n1:17:34.620 --> 1:17:38.020\n and smaller fires at the cost of much larger fires.\n\n1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:39.860\n So again, we're delaying short term volatility\n\n1:17:39.860 --> 1:17:42.580\n and exacerbating long run volatility.\n\n1:17:42.580 --> 1:17:44.340\n And in Mexico, it's the opposite, right?\n\n1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:46.500\n Just these wildfires burn much smaller\n\n1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:49.340\n and more continuously over time.\n\n1:17:49.340 --> 1:17:51.020\n The further effect of that in North America\n\n1:17:51.020 --> 1:17:53.180\n is that the fires can get so big and so hot\n\n1:17:53.180 --> 1:17:55.100\n that it burns away the top soil.\n\n1:17:55.100 --> 1:17:58.460\n So it actually destroys the fertility of the soil itself.\n\n1:17:58.460 --> 1:18:02.940\n So the point of this is that human intervention, right?\n\n1:18:02.940 --> 1:18:06.540\n Even the intention behind North American authorities\n\n1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:10.260\n managing that forest fire is to create less destruction.\n\n1:18:10.260 --> 1:18:11.940\n That is the intention,\n\n1:18:11.940 --> 1:18:15.300\n but the intention is divergent from the outcome.\n\n1:18:15.300 --> 1:18:18.900\n So in Taliban speak, he would say that human intervention\n\n1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:23.900\n moves us from mediocre stan into extremist stan.\n\n1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:27.340\n So mediocre stan would be something much more like nature\n\n1:18:27.340 --> 1:18:30.140\n where for instance, you can't double your body weight\n\n1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:33.700\n in a day, probably can't even do it in a year, right?\n\n1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:34.740\n But in extremist stan,\n\n1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:37.140\n which is something much more information based,\n\n1:18:37.140 --> 1:18:41.900\n you can double or send your net worth to zero\n\n1:18:41.900 --> 1:18:44.740\n in a single trade in a single moment, right?\n\n1:18:44.740 --> 1:18:46.700\n So when we try and intervene\n\n1:18:46.700 --> 1:18:48.620\n with natural biological systems\n\n1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:51.740\n that have these feedback loops,\n\n1:18:51.740 --> 1:18:53.820\n we actually start to push the system more\n\n1:18:53.820 --> 1:18:56.260\n to behave more like an extremist stan system\n\n1:18:57.340 --> 1:18:59.900\n that has less short run volatility,\n\n1:18:59.900 --> 1:19:03.260\n but more extreme long run volatility.\n\n1:19:03.260 --> 1:19:04.820\n So, but the question is,\n\n1:19:04.820 --> 1:19:09.340\n where you look at capitalism or communism, for example,\n\n1:19:09.340 --> 1:19:10.580\n and by the way, yes,\n\n1:19:10.580 --> 1:19:13.180\n I will talk to somebody who's a Marxist or a communist,\n\n1:19:13.180 --> 1:19:15.700\n like Richard Wolff is a pretty eloquent defender\n\n1:19:15.700 --> 1:19:18.300\n of these ideas because it's always good\n\n1:19:18.300 --> 1:19:19.980\n to really understand ideas\n\n1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:22.260\n as opposed to just reject them offhand.\n\n1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:26.300\n When you look at the system of capitalism\n\n1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:27.900\n or the system of communism,\n\n1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:32.140\n there's ideals and a lot of people argue\n\n1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:35.780\n in this perfect form would actually be good for the world.\n\n1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:38.620\n The question is how resilient are they\n\n1:19:38.620 --> 1:19:42.220\n to the corruption of human nature?\n\n1:19:42.220 --> 1:19:45.220\n And I mean, you're saying that there's not a,\n\n1:19:45.220 --> 1:19:47.380\n there's never been a free market.\n\n1:19:47.380 --> 1:19:48.820\n It's a very true statement.\n\n1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:52.940\n The question is how resilient is capitalism\n\n1:19:52.940 --> 1:19:54.700\n or whatever implementations of capitalism\n\n1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:57.340\n we had up to this point to human nature\n\n1:19:57.340 --> 1:19:59.340\n where one person will become successful\n\n1:19:59.340 --> 1:20:03.060\n through legitimate means\n\n1:20:03.060 --> 1:20:05.940\n and starts to try to manipulate the system\n\n1:20:05.940 --> 1:20:07.580\n that takes it away from a free market\n\n1:20:07.580 --> 1:20:10.940\n or takes it away from the things\n\n1:20:10.940 --> 1:20:13.900\n that gave them the riches in the first place.\n\n1:20:13.900 --> 1:20:17.220\n And then try to, through corruption, get more,\n\n1:20:17.220 --> 1:20:20.780\n get this, the thing you said, the lazy human ways.\n\n1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:22.980\n Now try to figure out how to get something for nothing.\n\n1:20:22.980 --> 1:20:24.220\n That's right.\n\n1:20:24.220 --> 1:20:26.820\n So how resilient do you think is capitalism to that?\n\n1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:31.460\n Well, the best implementation we've had of it\n\n1:20:31.460 --> 1:20:35.700\n really has been the United States, I think,\n\n1:20:35.700 --> 1:20:36.620\n up until this point.\n\n1:20:36.620 --> 1:20:41.620\n But it's still the central banking itself.\n\n1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:45.820\n This was in the 1848 Manifesto to the Communist Party.\n\n1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:49.740\n Measure number five reads an exclusive state monopoly\n\n1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:51.860\n and centralized control over cash and credit.\n\n1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:56.620\n So the central bank is a Marxist or communist institution.\n\n1:20:56.620 --> 1:20:58.740\n It is antithetical to the free market principles\n\n1:20:58.740 --> 1:21:00.460\n on which the United States was founded.\n\n1:21:00.460 --> 1:21:02.060\n And indeed, the United States resisted\n\n1:21:02.060 --> 1:21:04.460\n the implementation of a central bank.\n\n1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:06.500\n I think it was Andrew Jackson.\n\n1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.420\n I know there was the first national bank,\n\n1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:10.820\n the second national bank were both disbanded.\n\n1:21:10.820 --> 1:21:14.060\n And then Andrew Jackson, which is my favorite Tennessean,\n\n1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:18.180\n he has some famous quotes about routing out the bankers\n\n1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:19.700\n like a den of vipers.\n\n1:21:19.700 --> 1:21:23.060\n I think he punched one of the central bankers in the face.\n\n1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:26.980\n Back when our leaders were a bit more badass,\n\n1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:28.820\n I guess you might say.\n\n1:21:28.820 --> 1:21:33.820\n And finally in 1913, the Federal Reserve was implemented.\n\n1:21:35.380 --> 1:21:39.460\n And it's been kind of all downhill from there.\n\n1:21:39.460 --> 1:21:41.940\n So what is, can you, oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\n1:21:41.940 --> 1:21:45.620\n I was just gonna say that communism and capitalism,\n\n1:21:45.620 --> 1:21:47.220\n it's also a matter of scale.\n\n1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:51.500\n The ideal behind communism is from each\n\n1:21:51.500 --> 1:21:54.100\n according to their ability to each according to their need.\n\n1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:55.420\n Sounds beautiful, right?\n\n1:21:55.420 --> 1:21:58.380\n Sounds like a great, peaceful, harmonious way\n\n1:21:58.380 --> 1:22:00.020\n to organize ourselves.\n\n1:22:00.020 --> 1:22:03.700\n The problem is, and by the way, I am a communist\n\n1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:05.500\n in my family, in my home, right?\n\n1:22:05.500 --> 1:22:07.140\n At that very smallest of scales.\n\n1:22:07.140 --> 1:22:10.220\n Yes, in your very small circles of trust,\n\n1:22:10.220 --> 1:22:13.940\n you're much more likely to behave selflessly\n\n1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:14.780\n towards one another.\n\n1:22:14.780 --> 1:22:17.260\n By the way, I look forward to the Bitcoin community\n\n1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:20.900\n clipping out that part, saying that Robert Breedlove\n\n1:22:20.900 --> 1:22:23.980\n was a communist and the ideals of communism are beautiful.\n\n1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:25.580\n Yeah, context matters, people.\n\n1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:28.260\n Sorry, go ahead.\n\n1:22:29.420 --> 1:22:33.100\n But to your point, it does not scale, right?\n\n1:22:33.100 --> 1:22:37.900\n As we move into this larger system\n\n1:22:37.900 --> 1:22:41.580\n of socioeconomic cooperation, which is necessary\n\n1:22:41.580 --> 1:22:44.940\n to deepen the division of labor, to generate more wealth.\n\n1:22:44.940 --> 1:22:48.540\n We need to interact with one another on much larger scales\n\n1:22:48.540 --> 1:22:52.220\n than this communistic utopian ideal.\n\n1:22:52.220 --> 1:22:54.340\n We get into the realm of capitalism\n\n1:22:54.340 --> 1:22:58.020\n where we need really sound rules, hard rules,\n\n1:22:58.020 --> 1:23:03.020\n consensus, verifiability, and frankly, prices.\n\n1:23:03.620 --> 1:23:06.340\n Because the other thing in Soviet Russia\n\n1:23:06.340 --> 1:23:08.780\n is they tried to replace the profit motive\n\n1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:13.140\n or the price signal with this devotion to,\n\n1:23:13.140 --> 1:23:15.420\n this nationalistic faith and devotion.\n\n1:23:15.420 --> 1:23:18.340\n Where it's like, you don't need self interest anymore.\n\n1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:20.300\n You don't need prices or profits.\n\n1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:23.220\n You can just protect Mother Russia, right?\n\n1:23:23.220 --> 1:23:26.420\n And serve Mother Russia and that would create wealth.\n\n1:23:26.420 --> 1:23:28.060\n And what happened, right?\n\n1:23:28.060 --> 1:23:29.780\n They destroyed price signals.\n\n1:23:29.780 --> 1:23:32.180\n There were shortages, there were famines,\n\n1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:35.980\n there's all levels of corruption.\n\n1:23:35.980 --> 1:23:38.380\n Because to your point, it's once you,\n\n1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:42.500\n people have to run the system no matter what.\n\n1:23:42.500 --> 1:23:45.420\n So when people are always pursuing something for nothing\n\n1:23:45.420 --> 1:23:46.700\n and you put someone in a seat\n\n1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:49.260\n of much closer to absolute power\n\n1:23:49.260 --> 1:23:51.420\n where they're making all the pricing decisions,\n\n1:23:51.420 --> 1:23:54.820\n they own all of the productive factors in the economy,\n\n1:23:54.820 --> 1:23:57.780\n they're not beholden to any market force.\n\n1:23:57.780 --> 1:24:01.700\n There's no market check on their action\n\n1:24:01.700 --> 1:24:04.820\n that that institution tends to become more corrupt.\n\n1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:08.900\n And further, it's an inferior resource strategy.\n\n1:24:10.700 --> 1:24:12.860\n I alluded to this earlier where the other way\n\n1:24:12.860 --> 1:24:17.340\n to think about free market versus central planning is\n\n1:24:17.340 --> 1:24:20.460\n it's decentralized or distributed computing\n\n1:24:20.460 --> 1:24:21.980\n versus centralized computing.\n\n1:24:22.820 --> 1:24:26.180\n So each one of us, I think that the number\n\n1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:29.460\n is 120 bits per second of active awareness.\n\n1:24:29.460 --> 1:24:32.060\n And so we can take in, clearly we process a lot more\n\n1:24:32.060 --> 1:24:33.180\n than that, but our active awareness,\n\n1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:34.860\n I think is 120 bits per second.\n\n1:24:37.540 --> 1:24:40.700\n In a centralized planning body like in Soviet Russia,\n\n1:24:40.700 --> 1:24:41.900\n they had the pricing czar.\n\n1:24:41.900 --> 1:24:44.740\n Maybe they had 10, 20,000 people deciding the prices\n\n1:24:44.740 --> 1:24:46.100\n for the entire country.\n\n1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:48.980\n You're only getting that much data throughput, right?\n\n1:24:48.980 --> 1:24:52.340\n 20,000 people times 120 bits per second.\n\n1:24:52.340 --> 1:24:56.140\n Whereas in a free market, if everyone is free to interact\n\n1:24:56.140 --> 1:24:59.060\n with deep capital markets based on an accurate price,\n\n1:24:59.060 --> 1:25:02.060\n you're getting the data throughput of 120 bits per second\n\n1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:04.460\n times the entire economy, right?\n\n1:25:04.460 --> 1:25:08.820\n So you're getting, it's a more efficient means\n\n1:25:08.820 --> 1:25:11.780\n for disseminating knowledge effectively.\n\n1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:14.020\n And then again, knowledge is just,\n\n1:25:14.020 --> 1:25:17.300\n the more knowledge a socioeconomic structure can contain,\n\n1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.180\n the more wealthy it is, right?\n\n1:25:19.180 --> 1:25:21.780\n Prices, tools, all these things are just knowledge.\n\n1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:26.780\n So in that respect, that's why something like capitalism,\n\n1:25:27.100 --> 1:25:30.740\n even in its marginalized form, state capitalism,\n\n1:25:30.740 --> 1:25:33.100\n out competes communism.\n\n1:25:33.100 --> 1:25:36.420\n It's distributed computing versus centralized computing.\n\n1:25:36.420 --> 1:25:40.620\n You know, we kind of brought up religion\n\n1:25:40.620 --> 1:25:45.620\n and Joseph Campbell and myth and the propagation of ideas.\n\n1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:48.020\n And kind of before I forget,\n\n1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:50.580\n I wanted to ask your thoughts about this.\n\n1:25:50.580 --> 1:25:55.060\n You know, Jordan Peterson, I haven't really understood\n\n1:25:55.060 --> 1:25:58.580\n exactly like be able to pin him down exactly\n\n1:25:58.580 --> 1:26:03.580\n what he sees as the role of religion in human society.\n\n1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:08.580\n But it feels like he's describing it as having value for us.\n\n1:26:12.140 --> 1:26:15.300\n The ideas of myth are valuable.\n\n1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:18.460\n They're valuable mechanisms toward,\n\n1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:21.340\n I think you mentioned kind of directing us\n\n1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:23.620\n in this world as a human society.\n\n1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:26.060\n Do you think about myth?\n\n1:26:26.060 --> 1:26:27.460\n Do you think about religion?\n\n1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:31.820\n What's the use of it in this construct of markets\n\n1:26:31.820 --> 1:26:36.820\n in this framework of where ideas are ultimately\n\n1:26:37.940 --> 1:26:42.940\n the fundamental thing that makes societies work?\n\n1:26:44.540 --> 1:26:49.540\n Yeah, I think Jordan Peterson, who I'm a huge fan of,\n\n1:26:49.780 --> 1:26:52.740\n he's been very influential in my thinking\n\n1:26:52.740 --> 1:26:56.180\n and influential on my own religious views as well.\n\n1:26:56.180 --> 1:27:00.180\n I think his position would be, and he's said this before,\n\n1:27:00.180 --> 1:27:03.820\n that he acts as if God exists.\n\n1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.460\n And I've had some arguments about this before,\n\n1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:12.660\n but to me that points towards the preeminence of action\n\n1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:14.180\n and how important action is\n\n1:27:14.180 --> 1:27:17.700\n versus your cognitive beliefs necessarily.\n\n1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:20.820\n And I think there is a lot of utility in that,\n\n1:27:20.820 --> 1:27:24.380\n that if you follow the moral code of something,\n\n1:27:24.380 --> 1:27:28.420\n like the Bible, you do reap benefits from that.\n\n1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:30.500\n Society reaps benefits from that.\n\n1:27:32.700 --> 1:27:35.460\n And sometimes I bring up this point and people are like,\n\n1:27:35.460 --> 1:27:36.300\n oh my God, are you kidding me?\n\n1:27:36.300 --> 1:27:37.620\n Have you read the Old Testament?\n\n1:27:37.620 --> 1:27:39.540\n They're clobbering people with rocks\n\n1:27:39.540 --> 1:27:41.500\n when they do the wrong thing.\n\n1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:44.580\n The Bible doesn't claim to be this,\n\n1:27:44.580 --> 1:27:46.500\n like do everything that was done in the Bible.\n\n1:27:46.500 --> 1:27:48.940\n It's more like charting this moral progression\n\n1:27:48.940 --> 1:27:51.620\n where we came from this very barbaric society\n\n1:27:51.620 --> 1:27:54.220\n into something more like the New Testament\n\n1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:56.820\n where we're honoring individual sovereignty\n\n1:27:56.820 --> 1:27:58.220\n above the state and things like that.\n\n1:27:58.220 --> 1:28:02.980\n So I think that mythology itself\n\n1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:05.580\n is another form of data compression.\n\n1:28:05.580 --> 1:28:08.100\n If you look at these stories,\n\n1:28:08.100 --> 1:28:10.020\n Cain and Abel is a good example,\n\n1:28:10.020 --> 1:28:13.020\n or Peterson makes the point that it's a tiny story.\n\n1:28:13.020 --> 1:28:16.020\n It's a paragraph ish long,\n\n1:28:16.020 --> 1:28:18.620\n but it contains so many layers of meaning\n\n1:28:18.620 --> 1:28:22.620\n in regards to violence, to evil, betrayal, work,\n\n1:28:24.620 --> 1:28:27.220\n the divergence between intention and result,\n\n1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:29.620\n because I think Cain is actually making,\n\n1:28:31.180 --> 1:28:34.420\n he's making the effort to sacrifice for God,\n\n1:28:34.420 --> 1:28:36.700\n but the sacrifices he's making are not,\n\n1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:39.180\n God doesn't find them useful.\n\n1:28:39.180 --> 1:28:41.460\n And so he sort of rejects them.\n\n1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:48.260\n Again, if we're organizing these stories\n\n1:28:48.260 --> 1:28:50.500\n we're organized by these useful fictions, right?\n\n1:28:50.500 --> 1:28:53.420\n These, these Herarian imagined orders.\n\n1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:56.820\n I think mythology is kind of the original version of that,\n\n1:28:56.820 --> 1:29:01.820\n where we were learning to organize ourselves around stories\n\n1:29:03.340 --> 1:29:08.340\n to best coordinate our action across space and time.\n\n1:29:09.140 --> 1:29:12.420\n And so I think it's very foundational.\n\n1:29:14.220 --> 1:29:16.180\n And back to what we were saying in the beginning\n\n1:29:16.180 --> 1:29:18.420\n that if value truly is fundamental,\n\n1:29:18.420 --> 1:29:20.900\n I think it's interesting that all these stories\n\n1:29:20.900 --> 1:29:24.620\n point towards often common moral values.\n\n1:29:24.620 --> 1:29:26.380\n They're not perfectly aligned,\n\n1:29:27.700 --> 1:29:32.220\n but it does speak to just the evolutionary importance\n\n1:29:32.220 --> 1:29:34.620\n of morality and the subjectivity of morality,\n\n1:29:34.620 --> 1:29:38.060\n where morality sort of evolves over time based on,\n\n1:29:39.100 --> 1:29:40.900\n frankly, the capital stock we've accumulated.\n\n1:29:40.900 --> 1:29:42.580\n The more capital stock we've accumulated,\n\n1:29:42.580 --> 1:29:45.700\n the easier life is, the less barbaric we have to be.\n\n1:29:45.700 --> 1:29:49.540\n Whereas if we're living in conditions of true scarcity,\n\n1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:54.140\n then we tend to be a bit more barbaric towards one another.\n\n1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:57.180\n And that too, to dovetail this\n\n1:29:57.180 --> 1:29:59.380\n into something largely unrelated,\n\n1:29:59.380 --> 1:30:02.140\n but I think is really important is inflation.\n\n1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:07.380\n Inflation by artificially increasing the prices\n\n1:30:07.380 --> 1:30:09.620\n of goods and services in the world, right?\n\n1:30:09.620 --> 1:30:12.060\n We're injecting more dollars,\n\n1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:15.020\n chasing the same level of goods and services.\n\n1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:17.940\n We are artificially increasing scarcity,\n\n1:30:19.460 --> 1:30:21.700\n perceived scarcity, right?\n\n1:30:21.700 --> 1:30:24.780\n And when you increase perceived scarcity,\n\n1:30:24.780 --> 1:30:27.700\n you are amplifying divisiveness.\n\n1:30:30.060 --> 1:30:33.300\n The natural state of man is when everything is scarce\n\n1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:34.700\n and you really have to fight hard\n\n1:30:34.700 --> 1:30:37.580\n just to eat or drink water that day.\n\n1:30:37.580 --> 1:30:40.540\n So it's decivilizing in a way\n\n1:30:40.540 --> 1:30:42.540\n by artificially amplifying\n\n1:30:42.540 --> 1:30:44.780\n the perceived scarcity in the world.\n\n1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:47.340\n Can you elaborate how does inflation increase\n\n1:30:47.340 --> 1:30:49.220\n the perceived scarcity in the world?\n\n1:30:49.220 --> 1:30:52.980\n So we could think the price itself is an indication,\n\n1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:54.620\n it's a data packet, if you will.\n\n1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:57.820\n The price is a data packet on supply and demand, right?\n\n1:30:57.820 --> 1:31:00.460\n It's telling you how much supply there is\n\n1:31:00.460 --> 1:31:03.540\n of something in the world relative to the demand.\n\n1:31:03.540 --> 1:31:06.460\n So when you print money\n\n1:31:06.460 --> 1:31:08.620\n and artificially increase that price,\n\n1:31:08.620 --> 1:31:10.820\n it's diverging away from supply and demand.\n\n1:31:10.820 --> 1:31:13.820\n It's becoming just more of a product of policy\n\n1:31:13.820 --> 1:31:16.180\n than it is of free market fundamentals.\n\n1:31:17.900 --> 1:31:19.980\n The more expensive something is,\n\n1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:22.860\n that is a signal to the marketplace and to market actors\n\n1:31:22.860 --> 1:31:24.700\n that it is scarce, right?\n\n1:31:24.700 --> 1:31:28.340\n That's why a Leonardo painting\n\n1:31:28.340 --> 1:31:30.780\n might sell for $16 million, there's only one,\n\n1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:32.940\n there's a lot of demand for it.\n\n1:31:32.940 --> 1:31:36.020\n Maybe my numbers are off, but you get the point.\n\n1:31:36.020 --> 1:31:38.420\n It's the reason mask spiked in price\n\n1:31:38.420 --> 1:31:39.940\n after the COVID announcement, right?\n\n1:31:39.940 --> 1:31:41.900\n There was not enough supply,\n\n1:31:41.900 --> 1:31:43.660\n toilet paper, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:31:43.660 --> 1:31:47.700\n So inflation, and by inflation,\n\n1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:50.900\n I specifically mean arbitrary fiat currency\n\n1:31:50.900 --> 1:31:53.900\n supply inflation by legal monopoly,\n\n1:31:53.900 --> 1:31:57.340\n not inflation is a commonly misunderstood word.\n\n1:31:57.340 --> 1:32:01.380\n That is amplifying the perception of scarcity\n\n1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:03.580\n among market actors in the world.\n\n1:32:03.580 --> 1:32:07.860\n And I would argue that it actually amplifies divisiveness.\n\n1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:12.060\n I think this is the key maybe to looking at\n\n1:32:12.060 --> 1:32:15.140\n the connection between the monopolization of money\n\n1:32:15.140 --> 1:32:17.180\n and things like cancel culture,\n\n1:32:17.180 --> 1:32:22.180\n because it's increasing our natural predilection\n\n1:32:22.820 --> 1:32:24.340\n to be combative with one another,\n\n1:32:24.340 --> 1:32:26.740\n because we think there's more scarcity in the world\n\n1:32:26.740 --> 1:32:27.980\n than there actually is,\n\n1:32:27.980 --> 1:32:29.900\n versus in a world where you're not increasing\n\n1:32:29.900 --> 1:32:33.220\n the money supply, prices are declining every year.\n\n1:32:33.220 --> 1:32:36.460\n As prices decline, this is a signal to market actors\n\n1:32:36.460 --> 1:32:39.020\n and the market that scarcity is declining.\n\n1:32:39.020 --> 1:32:41.940\n There's less need to fight over things.\n\n1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:46.180\n And all of this ties back into the old Bastiat saying\n\n1:32:46.180 --> 1:32:49.460\n that if goods don't cross borders, soldiers will.\n\n1:32:50.300 --> 1:32:52.020\n So if we're not trading with one another,\n\n1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:53.940\n if we're not acting interdependently,\n\n1:32:53.940 --> 1:32:58.940\n and we're not becoming more intelligent as a market,\n\n1:33:00.140 --> 1:33:03.820\n and that increased intelligence or increased knowledge\n\n1:33:03.820 --> 1:33:06.620\n is reflected in decreased prices,\n\n1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:11.020\n because prices are just the exchange ratios of things.\n\n1:33:11.020 --> 1:33:12.980\n So the smarter we can solve problems,\n\n1:33:12.980 --> 1:33:15.900\n the better we can solve problems, the less prices would be.\n\n1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:18.820\n So it induces more cooperation.\n\n1:33:18.820 --> 1:33:21.660\n I love how you tie inflation and cancel culture together\n\n1:33:21.660 --> 1:33:26.660\n as essentially artificial creation of increase of conflict.\n\n1:33:28.380 --> 1:33:30.420\n Artificially increasing scarcity\n\n1:33:30.420 --> 1:33:33.300\n and thereby artificially increasing conflict.\n\n1:33:33.300 --> 1:33:34.900\n That's really fascinating.\n\n1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:38.460\n You're short circuiting my brain\n\n1:33:38.460 --> 1:33:40.500\n many times throughout this conversation.\n\n1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:45.340\n Okay, this robot is struggling to keep up.\n\n1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:50.340\n Okay, maybe to step back at the useful fictions\n\n1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:53.860\n or pragmatic truths.\n\n1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:56.180\n Let me ask the question that you've answered\n\n1:33:56.180 --> 1:34:00.260\n in many ways already, but let's explicitly look at.\n\n1:34:00.260 --> 1:34:01.900\n What is money?\n\n1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:04.060\n Oh, as you know, that's my favorite question.\n\n1:34:04.060 --> 1:34:04.900\n Yes.\n\n1:34:07.500 --> 1:34:09.940\n Is the name of the show I just launched,\n\n1:34:09.940 --> 1:34:11.420\n the What is Money show?\n\n1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:16.980\n Clearly, we could say that the Bitcoin rabbit hole\n\n1:34:16.980 --> 1:34:20.580\n is what's led me to explore a lot of these ideas in depth.\n\n1:34:22.180 --> 1:34:23.860\n And I think as we've demonstrated today,\n\n1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:26.660\n it goes well beyond just the economic sphere\n\n1:34:26.660 --> 1:34:28.780\n when you start to think about things like exchange\n\n1:34:28.780 --> 1:34:33.140\n and morality and time preference and civilization.\n\n1:34:33.140 --> 1:34:35.980\n So I love the question, what is money?\n\n1:34:35.980 --> 1:34:40.340\n I think it is the key to incepting a deeper understanding\n\n1:34:40.340 --> 1:34:42.260\n of the world into people that if you actually\n\n1:34:42.260 --> 1:34:47.220\n just start to ask the seemingly simple question,\n\n1:34:47.220 --> 1:34:51.420\n it surfaces more and more layers of truth.\n\n1:34:51.420 --> 1:34:55.820\n And I recently, I just wrote a piece,\n\n1:34:55.820 --> 1:34:59.780\n I think I have 30 something answers to this question.\n\n1:34:59.780 --> 1:35:00.620\n So there's.\n\n1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:03.340\n So sometimes it's actually a more systematic way\n\n1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:06.540\n of asking the question of what is the meaning of life?\n\n1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:11.180\n There's some questions that are almost unanswerable,\n\n1:35:11.180 --> 1:35:16.180\n but in their asking allow you to deeply get closer to truth,\n\n1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:21.420\n deeply understand the nature of our human existence.\n\n1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:23.020\n And the meaning of life is almost like\n\n1:35:23.020 --> 1:35:28.020\n this initial philosophers striving towards that.\n\n1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:33.020\n If money is indeed as fundamental as you've described,\n\n1:35:34.540 --> 1:35:38.140\n especially in the context of value being fundamental,\n\n1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:40.380\n then that is a really, that's a more,\n\n1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:43.140\n let's take a 21st century way of asking the same question\n\n1:35:43.140 --> 1:35:45.060\n about what is the meaning of life.\n\n1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:47.740\n You mentioned that it's a meta property\n\n1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:51.080\n out of the list of many ways to answer that question.\n\n1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:53.260\n How would you help people to think about that?\n\n1:35:53.260 --> 1:35:58.260\n Yeah, the first most serious answer\n\n1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:01.440\n comes from the school of Austrian economics\n\n1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:06.440\n and it defines money as a universal medium of exchange.\n\n1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:11.500\n So this would be any good that is used,\n\n1:36:12.540 --> 1:36:17.540\n held and used purely for purposes of facilitating exchange.\n\n1:36:17.540 --> 1:36:22.540\n So in the configuration of demand for any particular asset,\n\n1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:26.780\n it's bifurcated between its utility,\n\n1:36:26.780 --> 1:36:28.220\n which is something a service\n\n1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:31.020\n that it can render to you in real time,\n\n1:36:31.020 --> 1:36:35.060\n whether it's, if it's water, you're thirsty,\n\n1:36:35.060 --> 1:36:38.060\n that's the utility of water is that it can quench your thirst\n\n1:36:39.080 --> 1:36:41.900\n whereas the marketability would be the expectation\n\n1:36:41.900 --> 1:36:44.980\n of future exchange that other people would want this asset\n\n1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:47.580\n in the future to trade it for whatever they may have.\n\n1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:53.660\n Money is just going to be the good in any trading economy\n\n1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:56.020\n that has the highest proportion of marketability\n\n1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:57.900\n relative to utility.\n\n1:36:57.900 --> 1:37:00.580\n So today that would be gold.\n\n1:37:00.580 --> 1:37:03.460\n Gold has utility, it's used in electronics,\n\n1:37:03.460 --> 1:37:06.540\n it's used in dental dentistry and whatnot,\n\n1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:09.920\n but it's largely used as a store of value across time\n\n1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:12.200\n and that's what it's been used for for 5,000 years.\n\n1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:16.700\n So if we say gold has a $10 trillion market cap,\n\n1:37:16.700 --> 1:37:19.380\n maybe 2 trillion of that is its utility value\n\n1:37:19.380 --> 1:37:22.620\n or it's actually demand for use in computers and dentistry\n\n1:37:22.620 --> 1:37:24.500\n and an 8 trillion of that is demand\n\n1:37:24.500 --> 1:37:26.240\n for its use as a store of value.\n\n1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:32.540\n Money, the marketability aspects of money\n\n1:37:32.540 --> 1:37:35.820\n boils down to five services that money can render.\n\n1:37:36.780 --> 1:37:40.340\n Money needs to be divisible, it needs to be durable,\n\n1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:42.820\n it needs to be recognizable, it needs to be portable\n\n1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:44.320\n and it needs to be scarce.\n\n1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:47.240\n So I'll gloss over a lot of history with this\n\n1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:50.040\n and just say that historically,\n\n1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:51.920\n money's always been a technology,\n\n1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:53.700\n still is a technology or a tool.\n\n1:37:53.700 --> 1:37:55.180\n I use these terms interchangeably\n\n1:37:55.180 --> 1:37:56.780\n and you think of a technology\n\n1:37:56.780 --> 1:37:59.080\n as just a more sophisticated tool effectively.\n\n1:38:02.620 --> 1:38:03.980\n To best satisfy those properties,\n\n1:38:03.980 --> 1:38:05.620\n monetary metals were determined\n\n1:38:05.620 --> 1:38:08.340\n to be the most satisfactory tool,\n\n1:38:08.340 --> 1:38:10.060\n the most divisible, most durable, most recognizable,\n\n1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:13.180\n most portable tool in the marketplace.\n\n1:38:13.180 --> 1:38:17.060\n Of the monetary metals, gold was the most scarce\n\n1:38:17.060 --> 1:38:20.620\n as quantified by either its stock to flow ratio\n\n1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:22.280\n or its inflation resistance.\n\n1:38:22.280 --> 1:38:25.580\n So simple way to say this is that people always prefer\n\n1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:27.980\n the money most resistant to inflation.\n\n1:38:27.980 --> 1:38:30.780\n That's a nice definition of scarcity in the context.\n\n1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:34.020\n The money is, if you were to measure it,\n\n1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:36.180\n the resistance to inflation.\n\n1:38:36.180 --> 1:38:38.340\n So how hard is it to artificially increase\n\n1:38:38.340 --> 1:38:39.980\n the supply of the thing?\n\n1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:41.860\n That is the hardness of money.\n\n1:38:41.860 --> 1:38:43.420\n And that's why gold is hard money.\n\n1:38:43.420 --> 1:38:44.900\n Because the alchemy is hard.\n\n1:38:44.900 --> 1:38:46.140\n That's right.\n\n1:38:46.140 --> 1:38:47.300\n Because no one cracked the alchemy.\n\n1:38:47.300 --> 1:38:48.380\n So gold became money.\n\n1:38:49.820 --> 1:38:54.820\n So that's such a nice clean explanation of what is money\n\n1:38:56.180 --> 1:38:59.340\n with the five elements and gold ultimately won out\n\n1:38:59.340 --> 1:39:01.740\n because of the last piece of scarcity.\n\n1:39:01.740 --> 1:39:02.580\n That's right.\n\n1:39:02.580 --> 1:39:04.660\n And to get to maybe dig a little deeper there.\n\n1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:08.460\n So scarcity, we commonly think of scarcity\n\n1:39:08.460 --> 1:39:12.460\n as strictly a supply property,\n\n1:39:12.460 --> 1:39:15.260\n where if there's not much of something, then it's scarce.\n\n1:39:15.260 --> 1:39:16.580\n But it's not actually true.\n\n1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:20.780\n Scarcity occurs when demand exceeds supply.\n\n1:39:20.780 --> 1:39:24.380\n So when there's more demand than the supply can justify,\n\n1:39:24.380 --> 1:39:26.300\n the thing becomes an economic good\n\n1:39:26.300 --> 1:39:30.060\n and it establishes itself a market price.\n\n1:39:30.060 --> 1:39:31.560\n So there's more demand for the thing\n\n1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.780\n than the supply can satisfy.\n\n1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:37.060\n The unique thing about money as a concept at least\n\n1:39:37.060 --> 1:39:40.780\n is that demand always exceeds supply.\n\n1:39:40.780 --> 1:39:43.500\n There's never enough money to satisfy everyone, right?\n\n1:39:43.500 --> 1:39:46.380\n Because another definition for money,\n\n1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.580\n it's the most marketable good.\n\n1:39:48.580 --> 1:39:53.080\n So it can be traded for any other good service,\n\n1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:55.140\n piece of knowledge in the marketplace.\n\n1:39:55.140 --> 1:39:58.220\n So humans being what we are, we're never satisfied, right?\n\n1:39:58.220 --> 1:40:01.220\n We always want more of something, whatever it may be.\n\n1:40:01.220 --> 1:40:04.980\n So money as the ultimate token of obtaining that something\n\n1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:07.280\n is always scarce as a concept.\n\n1:40:09.020 --> 1:40:12.580\n But the problem with money is that if you can,\n\n1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:15.500\n as you alluded to, easily increase its supply,\n\n1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:17.060\n then all of a sudden you can compromise\n\n1:40:17.060 --> 1:40:18.580\n the scarcity of it over time\n\n1:40:19.980 --> 1:40:22.180\n and you can rob people through inflation.\n\n1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:26.580\n So that's why the market settled on gold as money.\n\n1:40:26.580 --> 1:40:31.500\n And robbing is reallocating the value that I,\n\n1:40:31.500 --> 1:40:35.540\n so essentially the one property, like why scarcity\n\n1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:40.880\n is important is it adds a lot more friction\n\n1:40:40.880 --> 1:40:45.880\n to the reallocation, like through essentially violence\n\n1:40:47.460 --> 1:40:48.900\n or implied violence.\n\n1:40:48.900 --> 1:40:51.380\n Well, it prevents it through cost of extraction too.\n\n1:40:51.380 --> 1:40:54.460\n So if you want to go out and dilute gold holders today,\n\n1:40:54.460 --> 1:40:57.420\n you have to go out into the world and mine gold.\n\n1:40:57.420 --> 1:40:59.720\n It's a very expensive process.\n\n1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:02.700\n That process tends to find equilibrium\n\n1:41:02.700 --> 1:41:05.180\n where production cost equals the market value of gold.\n\n1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:08.500\n So if market value is $2,000 an ounce today of gold,\n\n1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:10.960\n its production cost is going to be around there.\n\n1:41:10.960 --> 1:41:12.420\n That's the natural market equilibrium.\n\n1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:16.820\n So that way gold miners cannot just dilute people over time.\n\n1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:19.700\n Whereas if you look at something like fiat currency,\n\n1:41:19.700 --> 1:41:21.180\n which we're jumping ahead a little bit,\n\n1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:23.860\n but its production cost is zero.\n\n1:41:23.860 --> 1:41:26.540\n So there's a reason the market value of fiat currency\n\n1:41:26.540 --> 1:41:29.500\n historically has always converged to zero\n\n1:41:29.500 --> 1:41:31.500\n because its production cost is near zero.\n\n1:41:31.500 --> 1:41:34.060\n So the extension to that question might be\n\n1:41:34.060 --> 1:41:37.700\n how did we get from gold to paper currency?\n\n1:41:37.700 --> 1:41:40.460\n And again, this is rooted in the properties of money.\n\n1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:43.140\n As good as monetary metals were\n\n1:41:43.140 --> 1:41:47.660\n and as good as gold is as money at holding value across time,\n\n1:41:47.660 --> 1:41:50.740\n it's rather limited in terms of portability.\n\n1:41:50.740 --> 1:41:54.100\n It is not as useful for moving value across space.\n\n1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:55.820\n This is another definition of money, by the way,\n\n1:41:55.820 --> 1:42:00.340\n a social device for moving value across space and time.\n\n1:42:00.340 --> 1:42:04.820\n So to rectify this technological shortcoming of gold,\n\n1:42:04.820 --> 1:42:08.180\n we introduced, first of all,\n\n1:42:08.180 --> 1:42:10.900\n the custody of gold was gradually centralized\n\n1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:15.580\n into fewer and fewer warehousing operations.\n\n1:42:15.580 --> 1:42:17.780\n This is because there are economies of scale\n\n1:42:17.780 --> 1:42:20.980\n associated with using gold as money.\n\n1:42:20.980 --> 1:42:23.120\n And that if you centralize the custody,\n\n1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.460\n the warehouse owner can then issue a paper receipt\n\n1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:28.540\n called a warehouse receipt for that gold.\n\n1:42:28.540 --> 1:42:31.100\n And then market participants can trade that paper\n\n1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:32.500\n as if it's good as gold.\n\n1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:34.160\n And everyone has an option at any time\n\n1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:36.860\n to go and redeem real gold from the warehouse.\n\n1:42:36.860 --> 1:42:40.740\n So that system works until the problem with it\n\n1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:44.120\n is that it introduces the need to trust the custodian.\n\n1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:45.820\n So it's introducing counterparty risk\n\n1:42:45.820 --> 1:42:47.660\n in the form of the custodian.\n\n1:42:47.660 --> 1:42:50.240\n And now should that warehouse choose\n\n1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:54.140\n to increase the supply of paper notes to gold\n\n1:42:54.140 --> 1:42:55.420\n beyond its supply.\n\n1:42:55.420 --> 1:42:57.580\n So if it's got three tons of gold\n\n1:42:57.580 --> 1:43:00.900\n and it issues six tons worth of paper receipts,\n\n1:43:00.900 --> 1:43:03.440\n all of a sudden it's participating in a fraud.\n\n1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:04.520\n It's basically lying.\n\n1:43:04.520 --> 1:43:06.140\n It's representing that it has more gold\n\n1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:07.460\n than it actually does.\n\n1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:12.780\n And that is the pathway that we got into banking\n\n1:43:12.780 --> 1:43:14.000\n and central banking,\n\n1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:16.540\n is we needed a convenience mechanism\n\n1:43:16.540 --> 1:43:19.460\n to rectify the portability shortcomings of gold.\n\n1:43:19.460 --> 1:43:22.180\n We needed to be able to move value across space, right?\n\n1:43:22.180 --> 1:43:24.660\n Gold was doing a great job at moving value over time,\n\n1:43:24.660 --> 1:43:26.020\n but not space.\n\n1:43:26.020 --> 1:43:27.380\n Paper currency gave us the ability\n\n1:43:27.380 --> 1:43:29.140\n to move value across space,\n\n1:43:29.140 --> 1:43:31.560\n but it introduced this attack vector\n\n1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:34.200\n for warehouse operators, which became banks,\n\n1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:36.040\n which became central banks,\n\n1:43:36.040 --> 1:43:39.980\n to modify the supply to suit their own political agendas.\n\n1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:41.440\n Added the snooze button.\n\n1:43:42.380 --> 1:43:45.900\n That allows you to do a little fraud.\n\n1:43:45.900 --> 1:43:47.300\n To get something for nothing.\n\n1:43:47.300 --> 1:43:49.140\n Something, just a little bit at first.\n\n1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:53.500\n Just this one morning, just a little bit.\n\n1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:55.020\n I mean, I don't know if you can speak\n\n1:43:55.020 --> 1:44:00.020\n to the birth of fiat currency.\n\n1:44:00.140 --> 1:44:04.180\n Is there some interesting characteristics\n\n1:44:04.180 --> 1:44:07.580\n to those early steps that created it?\n\n1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.940\n Like, could it have been averted?\n\n1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:14.940\n Or is this the natural progression of governments?\n\n1:44:14.940 --> 1:44:18.240\n You know, what's funny is that central banking\n\n1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:22.560\n was initially designed to be the custodian of gold, right?\n\n1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:25.640\n And so they were going to custody the gold,\n\n1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:27.800\n issue paper on top of it,\n\n1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:30.560\n and then they would maintain,\n\n1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:32.560\n you could trust the public stamp effectively.\n\n1:44:32.560 --> 1:44:33.840\n You could trust that the central bank\n\n1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:36.480\n had as much gold on reserve as they said they had,\n\n1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:38.360\n and they were supposed to be the trustworthy institution.\n\n1:44:38.360 --> 1:44:41.160\n So we went from placing our trust\n\n1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:43.800\n in a free market game theoretic process,\n\n1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:45.960\n or trusting gold,\n\n1:44:45.960 --> 1:44:48.360\n and we began trusting this institution instead.\n\n1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:54.440\n This, that institution would not have arisen\n\n1:44:54.440 --> 1:44:58.160\n if the portability of gold was really high.\n\n1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:00.380\n If we could have somehow sent gold\n\n1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:02.320\n across a telecommunications channel,\n\n1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:05.080\n there would have been no need for a central bank.\n\n1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:07.560\n Everyone could have custodyed their gold\n\n1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:10.760\n in any information bearing medium, frankly,\n\n1:45:10.760 --> 1:45:13.760\n and they could beam it around the world at any time.\n\n1:45:13.760 --> 1:45:16.920\n So this whole institution itself\n\n1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:21.080\n is rooted in a technological shortcoming of gold.\n\n1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:24.160\n So I think it's, another way to think about that\n\n1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:28.600\n is maybe had there been all the gold in the world today\n\n1:45:28.600 --> 1:45:31.000\n fills two Olympic sized swimming pools,\n\n1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.960\n all the gold mined throughout all of human history.\n\n1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:34.780\n So there's not a lot, right?\n\n1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:38.760\n What if there had been just like way more?\n\n1:45:38.760 --> 1:45:39.600\n There'd just been, I don't know,\n\n1:45:39.600 --> 1:45:41.840\n 20,000 Olympic swimming pools worth.\n\n1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:45.280\n Portability wouldn't have been as much of an issue, right?\n\n1:45:45.280 --> 1:45:46.960\n We could have, and this is to say,\n\n1:45:46.960 --> 1:45:48.920\n assuming gold was still the most scarce metal\n\n1:45:48.920 --> 1:45:50.000\n and all these things,\n\n1:45:52.100 --> 1:45:53.440\n portability would have been less of an issue.\n\n1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:55.960\n We would have had less dependence\n\n1:45:55.960 --> 1:45:57.960\n or need for a central bank.\n\n1:45:57.960 --> 1:46:00.200\n So I think it's kind of idiosyncratic\n\n1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:03.720\n in that we just happened to end up here on this planet\n\n1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:05.120\n with a certain amount of gold.\n\n1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:07.400\n It best satisfied the properties of money.\n\n1:46:07.400 --> 1:46:08.920\n And a certain amount of humans,\n\n1:46:08.920 --> 1:46:12.120\n a geographic dispersed such that portability\n\n1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:14.280\n had certain properties that you want to achieve\n\n1:46:14.280 --> 1:46:16.080\n for humans in the geographical space\n\n1:46:16.080 --> 1:46:18.720\n to be able to be a exchange value.\n\n1:46:18.720 --> 1:46:20.920\n It became more of an issue as we globalized, right?\n\n1:46:20.920 --> 1:46:22.560\n As we became more of a global society,\n\n1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:26.440\n we needed money that could move across space really fast.\n\n1:46:26.440 --> 1:46:29.620\n So we could trade in international capital markets.\n\n1:46:29.620 --> 1:46:33.520\n So that drove the central bank\n\n1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:35.680\n to become the dominant institution of the world.\n\n1:46:35.680 --> 1:46:39.080\n And if you follow the flows of gold throughout history,\n\n1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:41.200\n you know, I've been watching this documentary\n\n1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:43.640\n on World War I and World War II on Netflix.\n\n1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:45.840\n I think it's called World War II in Color.\n\n1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:47.680\n Oh yeah, that's really good.\n\n1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:48.520\n So good.\n\n1:46:50.640 --> 1:46:53.480\n When I say gold has been the governor of governments\n\n1:46:53.480 --> 1:46:55.080\n or gold is geopolitical money,\n\n1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:59.140\n like it is the base layer operating system,\n\n1:46:59.140 --> 1:47:02.120\n has been the base layer operating system for analog society.\n\n1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:05.680\n So it's always been about who controls the gold,\n\n1:47:05.680 --> 1:47:07.760\n is who makes the rules.\n\n1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.200\n And that's, in that context,\n\n1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:12.720\n is why Bitcoin is so interesting\n\n1:47:12.720 --> 1:47:16.280\n because it is the disruptor to\n\n1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:18.840\n this base level operating system\n\n1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:22.040\n that's functioned for all of human history.\n\n1:47:22.040 --> 1:47:24.440\n I think this is a good place to ask,\n\n1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:26.320\n we asked the what is money question.\n\n1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:29.100\n What is Bitcoin?\n\n1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:34.100\n That's a question as complicated as what is money?\n\n1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:39.160\n I think if you get a general understanding of money\n\n1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:42.800\n from a number of angles,\n\n1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:47.800\n that we could say Bitcoin is the most superior\n\n1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:50.480\n monetary technology that has ever existed.\n\n1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.760\n So one of the most superior implementation\n\n1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:56.720\n of the ideas of money that you talked about,\n\n1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.320\n you talked about money as speech,\n\n1:47:58.320 --> 1:48:00.120\n you talked about money as an idea,\n\n1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:04.040\n we talked about money as sovereignty.\n\n1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:04.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:08.160\n So we're attaching the concept of money, to your point,\n\n1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:13.160\n to whatever tool best satisfies those properties of money\n\n1:48:13.760 --> 1:48:16.840\n or best renders those services we need for money.\n\n1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:19.320\n And as you said, you're using the word tool\n\n1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:20.720\n and technology interchangeably here.\n\n1:48:20.720 --> 1:48:22.300\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:24.820\n And another thing to think about here is that\n\n1:48:24.820 --> 1:48:28.480\n we think often in terms of goods or services,\n\n1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:31.880\n but actually everything is a service.\n\n1:48:31.880 --> 1:48:35.520\n So it's not the physical properties of this pen\n\n1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:36.800\n that I find valuable,\n\n1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.800\n it's the services that it renders to me,\n\n1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:40.460\n that I want to write a letter,\n\n1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:45.460\n this serves me by allowing me to lay ink on paper\n\n1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:47.880\n and communicate information.\n\n1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:52.880\n So value, humans attach value as we alluded to earlier,\n\n1:48:52.880 --> 1:48:55.520\n two services, not goods.\n\n1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:58.080\n So the properties or the services that money renders\n\n1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:00.760\n that human beings value are those five properties,\n\n1:49:00.760 --> 1:49:01.920\n divisibility, durability,\n\n1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:04.320\n recognizability, portability, scarcity.\n\n1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:09.280\n Metals best satisfied those services historically,\n\n1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:12.280\n but Bitcoin as the most superior monetary technology\n\n1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:16.640\n in human history, essentially perfects them.\n\n1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:18.400\n It's as close to perfection as we've ever been.\n\n1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:21.040\n So in terms of divisibility,\n\n1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.120\n each Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million subunits\n\n1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:26.200\n called a satoshi.\n\n1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:31.480\n If that divisibility were ever a problem,\n\n1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:35.120\n which actually there was a question that came up recently,\n\n1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:37.440\n if you divide the world population\n\n1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:38.760\n by the total supply of Bitcoin,\n\n1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:42.000\n you end up at like 0.3 Bitcoin per person,\n\n1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:46.060\n call it 300,000 satoshis per person.\n\n1:49:46.060 --> 1:49:50.560\n What if that was not enough to facilitate economic activity?\n\n1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:53.200\n And the answer to that is Bitcoin can soft fork\n\n1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:54.560\n into further divisibility.\n\n1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:57.000\n So if Bitcoin ate all the money in the world\n\n1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:00.480\n and the average Bitcoin or wealth\n\n1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:02.080\n will say 300,000 satoshis each,\n\n1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:06.160\n but that wasn't divisible enough maybe to buy coffee\n\n1:50:06.160 --> 1:50:07.560\n and do all these day to day transactions,\n\n1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:08.400\n what would happen?\n\n1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:09.800\n Well, we would increase its divisibility.\n\n1:50:09.800 --> 1:50:12.480\n So Bitcoin's perfected divisibility,\n\n1:50:12.480 --> 1:50:13.820\n the divisibility of money,\n\n1:50:13.820 --> 1:50:16.440\n lets us transact across scales, right?\n\n1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:21.240\n We can buy coffee or we can buy a house.\n\n1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.160\n Durability is an interesting one.\n\n1:50:23.160 --> 1:50:25.400\n So clearly something like gold is very durable.\n\n1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:28.280\n It's resistant to degradation over time.\n\n1:50:28.280 --> 1:50:30.280\n Bitcoin is just pure information,\n\n1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:33.540\n but it's stored in a distributed format.\n\n1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:37.000\n So information stored in a distributed fashion\n\n1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:40.840\n tends to be virtually infinitely durable.\n\n1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:41.800\n The example I'd like to give here\n\n1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:43.600\n is something like the Bible.\n\n1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.100\n The Bible is just distributed information.\n\n1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.240\n It's stored everywhere and nowhere, so to speak.\n\n1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:52.060\n And for that reason, it has outlasted empires.\n\n1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:54.360\n And Bitcoin's similar, right?\n\n1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:57.080\n You can't make changes to it unilaterally.\n\n1:50:57.080 --> 1:51:01.960\n But to make explicit the ways in which it is not durable\n\n1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:05.440\n is the fact that it relies on computing infrastructure.\n\n1:51:05.440 --> 1:51:08.360\n Like it needs computers.\n\n1:51:08.360 --> 1:51:11.160\n So if you were to destroy all the computers in the world,\n\n1:51:11.160 --> 1:51:16.160\n it needs mechanisms that store and transfer information.\n\n1:51:17.620 --> 1:51:20.100\n And so you could attack it.\n\n1:51:20.100 --> 1:51:22.100\n I mean, you could attack gold in the same kind of way,\n\n1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:23.800\n I suppose, through the physics,\n\n1:51:23.800 --> 1:51:26.260\n but it's probably easier to destroy\n\n1:51:26.260 --> 1:51:27.380\n all the computers in the world\n\n1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:30.300\n than it is to destroy all the gold in the world.\n\n1:51:30.300 --> 1:51:32.340\n Maybe not, I don't know.\n\n1:51:32.340 --> 1:51:33.660\n Anyway.\n\n1:51:33.660 --> 1:51:34.740\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n1:51:35.660 --> 1:51:38.480\n Maybe, I'm not sure which one would be harder to destroy.\n\n1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:41.900\n The other thing is there's a dynamic incentive.\n\n1:51:41.900 --> 1:51:44.820\n So every time you destroy Bitcoin miners,\n\n1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:46.580\n you're creating incentives for anyone else\n\n1:51:46.580 --> 1:51:48.900\n with access to electricity to mine\n\n1:51:48.900 --> 1:51:50.700\n because you're making the algorithm easier.\n\n1:51:50.700 --> 1:51:54.100\n Yeah, so the destruction is difficult\n\n1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:56.580\n because of the decentralized nature of the whole thing.\n\n1:51:56.580 --> 1:51:57.900\n And the difficulty adjustment.\n\n1:51:57.900 --> 1:52:00.480\n Yeah, so you're gonna have to use nuclear weapons\n\n1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.620\n and cover the whole globe, but anyway.\n\n1:52:02.620 --> 1:52:03.860\n Yeah, and by then,\n\n1:52:03.860 --> 1:52:06.020\n we've got much bigger problems than money, right?\n\n1:52:06.020 --> 1:52:09.660\n That's right, so okay, so that's durability.\n\n1:52:09.660 --> 1:52:12.300\n So portability, Bitcoin's pure information,\n\n1:52:12.300 --> 1:52:13.620\n it can move at the speed of light,\n\n1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:15.900\n can't get much faster than that.\n\n1:52:15.900 --> 1:52:19.540\n Recognizability refers to the ability\n\n1:52:19.540 --> 1:52:23.360\n to verify the veracity of the money or its authenticity.\n\n1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:27.320\n So you can actually, when we used to transact gold,\n\n1:52:27.320 --> 1:52:30.000\n there were time honored techniques for verifying\n\n1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.980\n that it was gold and not gold plated lead, for instance.\n\n1:52:32.980 --> 1:52:34.860\n This is where we get the term sound money.\n\n1:52:34.860 --> 1:52:36.760\n A gold coin made a very particular sound\n\n1:52:36.760 --> 1:52:38.620\n when dropped from a certain height.\n\n1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:40.220\n You've seen people biting coins.\n\n1:52:40.220 --> 1:52:44.100\n These are all techniques for testing the authenticity of gold.\n\n1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:46.440\n And with Bitcoin, we have something unique\n\n1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:48.300\n in that if you're running a full node,\n\n1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:51.180\n you can verify that the Bitcoin is Bitcoin, right?\n\n1:52:51.180 --> 1:52:54.880\n It cannot be tampered with, it cannot be faked.\n\n1:52:54.880 --> 1:52:57.260\n And in addition to that, as a node operator,\n\n1:52:57.260 --> 1:53:00.000\n you can audit the total supply of Bitcoin at any time,\n\n1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:01.560\n which is unlike any money in history.\n\n1:53:01.560 --> 1:53:04.180\n So you know with full certainty,\n\n1:53:04.180 --> 1:53:06.820\n if you're holding 1000 Bitcoin,\n\n1:53:06.820 --> 1:53:10.420\n you have 1000 out of a possible 21 million forever.\n\n1:53:10.420 --> 1:53:13.040\n You have a guaranteed fraction of the total supply.\n\n1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:14.740\n Yeah, so a full node contains information\n\n1:53:14.740 --> 1:53:16.580\n about every transaction that's ever been had\n\n1:53:16.580 --> 1:53:19.180\n so you can figure out, yeah, I mean,\n\n1:53:19.180 --> 1:53:23.840\n all the truth of this money is all right there.\n\n1:53:23.840 --> 1:53:25.800\n Yeah, it's like a fractal constituent\n\n1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:27.100\n of the whole network, right?\n\n1:53:27.100 --> 1:53:30.820\n The whole Bitcoin blockchain is comprised in a node too.\n\n1:53:30.820 --> 1:53:32.180\n Not the proof of work piece,\n\n1:53:32.180 --> 1:53:34.380\n but the entire transaction history.\n\n1:53:34.380 --> 1:53:37.060\n And so that's unique as well.\n\n1:53:37.060 --> 1:53:39.940\n And that's what makes Bitcoin the ultimate store of value\n\n1:53:39.940 --> 1:53:43.780\n is that you know with certainty what the total supply is\n\n1:53:43.780 --> 1:53:45.100\n and will ever be.\n\n1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:49.440\n And you know that your share of that supply is fixed.\n\n1:53:49.440 --> 1:53:50.460\n It cannot change.\n\n1:53:50.460 --> 1:53:51.860\n It can only improve actually.\n\n1:53:51.860 --> 1:53:53.700\n If someone loses, you know,\n\n1:53:53.700 --> 1:53:56.020\n if the Satoshi stash is truly gone forever,\n\n1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:58.000\n the million Bitcoin never moves,\n\n1:53:58.000 --> 1:53:59.960\n then we're talking about 1000 Bitcoin\n\n1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:03.140\n out of 20 million instead and so on and so forth.\n\n1:54:03.140 --> 1:54:05.760\n As more people lose access to their Bitcoin,\n\n1:54:05.760 --> 1:54:08.060\n they're basically making a contribution to everyone else.\n\n1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:09.560\n It's anti dilutive.\n\n1:54:10.460 --> 1:54:13.200\n And there's certain properties of Bitcoin\n\n1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:15.500\n that are sort of a little bit more into the details\n\n1:54:15.500 --> 1:54:19.080\n that ensure that the full nodes,\n\n1:54:19.080 --> 1:54:22.860\n like the size of all the transactions that ever happened,\n\n1:54:22.860 --> 1:54:24.340\n at least currently can be stored\n\n1:54:24.340 --> 1:54:25.740\n in a single computer, for example.\n\n1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:28.040\n So it doesn't blow up too quickly.\n\n1:54:28.040 --> 1:54:28.880\n That's right.\n\n1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:32.100\n But you know, there's arguments that that's not necessarily,\n\n1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:35.660\n you can make arguments for that to be a very nice property,\n\n1:54:35.660 --> 1:54:38.260\n but you can also say that there's like drawbacks to it.\n\n1:54:38.260 --> 1:54:41.540\n That's hence the block size debates\n\n1:54:41.540 --> 1:54:42.500\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:45.300\n Yeah, that was the Bitcoin Cash Civil War, right?\n\n1:54:45.300 --> 1:54:47.580\n Was that particular piece.\n\n1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:48.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:54:48.420 --> 1:54:50.780\n And, you know, ostensibly they were saying,\n\n1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:52.840\n oh, we need more transaction throughput\n\n1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:55.380\n to buy more coffee and do more transactions.\n\n1:54:55.380 --> 1:54:57.520\n But what they were actually doing\n\n1:54:57.520 --> 1:55:01.900\n was increasing the size computing power necessary\n\n1:55:01.900 --> 1:55:03.060\n to run a full node,\n\n1:55:03.060 --> 1:55:06.800\n which would have theoretically compromised decentralization.\n\n1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:09.540\n So yeah, but it would in theory,\n\n1:55:09.540 --> 1:55:11.660\n and this is, you know, in theory,\n\n1:55:11.660 --> 1:55:15.100\n it would allow you to have much more transactions.\n\n1:55:15.100 --> 1:55:16.020\n That's right.\n\n1:55:16.020 --> 1:55:18.540\n But the drawback, it would,\n\n1:55:18.540 --> 1:55:21.740\n because of no longer can be stored in a single computer,\n\n1:55:21.740 --> 1:55:24.740\n personal computer, then it naturally leads\n\n1:55:24.740 --> 1:55:25.940\n to the centralization.\n\n1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:26.780\n Yes.\n\n1:55:26.780 --> 1:55:28.060\n Which you see with gold.\n\n1:55:28.060 --> 1:55:30.660\n Which would have compromised its survivability.\n\n1:55:30.660 --> 1:55:31.780\n Right.\n\n1:55:31.780 --> 1:55:34.300\n So, I said, what else is there?\n\n1:55:34.300 --> 1:55:36.300\n The last one, which leads straight into this one,\n\n1:55:36.300 --> 1:55:38.460\n actually is the most important one of money,\n\n1:55:38.460 --> 1:55:40.020\n which is scarcity.\n\n1:55:40.020 --> 1:55:45.020\n And that you need to know the supply is fixed\n\n1:55:45.220 --> 1:55:49.460\n and safeguarded from counterfeiting and inflation,\n\n1:55:49.460 --> 1:55:52.620\n which counterfeiting and inflation are the same thing,\n\n1:55:52.620 --> 1:55:53.740\n by the way.\n\n1:55:53.740 --> 1:55:57.460\n Counterfeiting is criminalized inflation.\n\n1:55:57.460 --> 1:56:00.140\n Inflation is legalized counterfeiting.\n\n1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:01.780\n So central banks today,\n\n1:56:01.780 --> 1:56:03.220\n when they say they're printing money, they're not.\n\n1:56:03.220 --> 1:56:05.480\n They're counterfeiting currency.\n\n1:56:05.480 --> 1:56:07.140\n That's a very important part.\n\n1:56:07.140 --> 1:56:10.420\n And Bitcoin, as I've argued in some of my writing,\n\n1:56:11.380 --> 1:56:13.540\n is more than just an invention.\n\n1:56:13.540 --> 1:56:16.840\n It's actually the discovery of absolute scarcity.\n\n1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:20.040\n And that we have unveiled a property of money\n\n1:56:20.040 --> 1:56:25.040\n that we will only discover once, and it's got really\n\n1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:28.720\n major ramifications for the world at large.\n\n1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:33.660\n So with gold, for instance, as we've covered,\n\n1:56:33.660 --> 1:56:36.980\n it became money because it was the most relatively scarce\n\n1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:37.980\n monetary metal, right?\n\n1:56:37.980 --> 1:56:41.100\n Its supply was hardest to increase over time.\n\n1:56:41.100 --> 1:56:44.180\n However, if we could somehow flip a switch today\n\n1:56:44.180 --> 1:56:46.920\n and make everyone in the world go out and start mining gold,\n\n1:56:46.920 --> 1:56:49.100\n we could increase the supply much more quickly.\n\n1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:50.980\n We could, you know, it's historic inflation rates\n\n1:56:50.980 --> 1:56:53.480\n about 2%, we could double that pretty quickly.\n\n1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:58.580\n Bitcoin, with Bitcoin, it is not possible.\n\n1:56:58.580 --> 1:57:02.500\n So no matter how much effort and energy and capital\n\n1:57:02.500 --> 1:57:05.540\n and operational expenditure we pour into the mining network,\n\n1:57:05.540 --> 1:57:08.300\n we cannot deviate from its fixed\n\n1:57:08.300 --> 1:57:11.000\n and diminishing supply curve from between now\n\n1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.620\n and the last Bitcoin being mined in 2140\n\n1:57:13.620 --> 1:57:15.020\n because of the difficulty adjustment.\n\n1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:18.420\n It's constantly, it's adapting to human action actually.\n\n1:57:18.420 --> 1:57:21.940\n So the harder we pursue it, the more that it recedes,\n\n1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:23.340\n and then the less we pursue it,\n\n1:57:23.340 --> 1:57:26.020\n the more available it makes itself.\n\n1:57:26.020 --> 1:57:30.300\n And this is, it's a real major breakthrough\n\n1:57:30.300 --> 1:57:34.640\n because it's the closest thing to perfect information\n\n1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:37.340\n we've ever had in an economy.\n\n1:57:37.340 --> 1:57:41.340\n And perfect information is this, it's a theoretical,\n\n1:57:41.340 --> 1:57:46.340\n but unattainable state of the market where all market actors\n\n1:57:46.340 --> 1:57:50.220\n have all the relevant information about everything\n\n1:57:50.220 --> 1:57:53.100\n so that they can compete as efficiently as possible.\n\n1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:56.060\n And in a state of pure information, we have,\n\n1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:59.020\n I'm sorry, perfect information, we have perfect competition.\n\n1:57:59.020 --> 1:58:03.140\n And in perfect competition, we maximize wealth generation.\n\n1:58:03.140 --> 1:58:06.420\n So we're competing as freely as possible\n\n1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:10.140\n from coercive and violent impediments.\n\n1:58:10.140 --> 1:58:13.220\n And so I think Bitcoin in that sense\n\n1:58:13.220 --> 1:58:17.900\n is going to pull the world closer to a state\n\n1:58:17.900 --> 1:58:21.720\n of perfect competition than we've ever been before,\n\n1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:24.560\n which would increase wealth generation\n\n1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:26.460\n to an extent we've never seen before.\n\n1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:30.460\n Many of the things you said about Bitcoin\n\n1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:32.860\n also hold for other cryptocurrency technologies\n\n1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:34.320\n that followed after.\n\n1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:40.680\n Can you say something to why you think Bitcoin\n\n1:58:40.680 --> 1:58:43.900\n is the superior technology\n\n1:58:43.900 --> 1:58:48.900\n from a pragmatic truth perspective than say Ethereum,\n\n1:58:49.200 --> 1:58:52.660\n but also other crypto, like Bitcoin Cash,\n\n1:58:52.660 --> 1:58:55.380\n like other hard forks of Bitcoin,\n\n1:58:55.380 --> 1:58:59.780\n and maybe things that might yet to be invented,\n\n1:58:59.780 --> 1:59:01.420\n tools yet to be invented?\n\n1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:05.100\n Yeah, so this is a good point of argument\n\n1:59:05.100 --> 1:59:08.380\n because a lot of people have countered me and said,\n\n1:59:08.380 --> 1:59:11.260\n Bitcoin cannot be absolute scarcity\n\n1:59:11.260 --> 1:59:13.220\n because you can fork it and create something\n\n1:59:13.220 --> 1:59:15.500\n with the same properties as Bitcoin\n\n1:59:15.500 --> 1:59:17.700\n or potentially even better properties, right?\n\n1:59:17.700 --> 1:59:20.500\n You create something with a deflationary monetary policy.\n\n1:59:21.620 --> 1:59:23.620\n That's what Bitcoin Cash was actually.\n\n1:59:23.620 --> 1:59:26.220\n It forked Bitcoin with all of the same properties\n\n1:59:26.220 --> 1:59:29.260\n except for the block size that we alluded to earlier.\n\n1:59:29.260 --> 1:59:33.020\n The problem is that money is valued.\n\n1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:36.580\n Again, it's the good with a configuration of demand\n\n1:59:36.580 --> 1:59:40.400\n that is predominantly marketability.\n\n1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:43.560\n So it is valued based on its liquidity.\n\n1:59:43.560 --> 1:59:46.620\n That is how many other trading partners are there\n\n1:59:46.620 --> 1:59:48.780\n in that monetary network.\n\n1:59:48.780 --> 1:59:53.420\n So it is a network valued because of its liquidity\n\n1:59:53.420 --> 1:59:54.820\n and network effects.\n\n1:59:54.820 --> 1:59:57.980\n So any new entrant into the market for money\n\n1:59:59.180 --> 2:00:02.780\n is incentivized to always choose the money\n\n2:00:02.780 --> 2:00:06.460\n with the deepest liquidity and the most network effects.\n\n2:00:06.460 --> 2:00:10.540\n This is why money has tended to be a winner take all market\n\n2:00:10.540 --> 2:00:13.480\n because it's essentially a single purpose tool, right?\n\n2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:15.620\n It is a tool for,\n\n2:00:16.600 --> 2:00:19.700\n if we consider that tools are time saving devices, right?\n\n2:00:19.700 --> 2:00:21.680\n The shovel that you dig more holes per man hour\n\n2:00:21.680 --> 2:00:23.180\n than you can with your bare hands.\n\n2:00:23.180 --> 2:00:26.280\n Money is a tool, there's yet another definition of money\n\n2:00:26.280 --> 2:00:28.580\n that lets us calculate, negotiate\n\n2:00:28.580 --> 2:00:30.520\n and execute trades more quickly.\n\n2:00:31.540 --> 2:00:36.180\n So that function tends to coalesce\n\n2:00:36.180 --> 2:00:38.500\n towards one solution.\n\n2:00:38.500 --> 2:00:40.860\n And so the short answer would be that\n\n2:00:40.860 --> 2:00:44.620\n for the same reasons, quantifiable reasons, right?\n\n2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:48.500\n Like inflation resistance and liquidity and network effects\n\n2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:50.660\n that we have one analog gold,\n\n2:00:50.660 --> 2:00:53.540\n we're only likely to have one digital gold.\n\n2:00:53.540 --> 2:00:55.500\n And I think the Bitcoin Cash Fork\n\n2:00:55.500 --> 2:00:57.220\n proves that out empirically.\n\n2:00:57.220 --> 2:00:59.540\n It's a good case study because.\n\n2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:00.860\n Well, it's one case study, right?\n\n2:01:00.860 --> 2:01:02.980\n But okay, so that's really well put.\n\n2:01:02.980 --> 2:01:04.580\n So like gold was sticky.\n\n2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:08.460\n Once it was accepted, the network effects,\n\n2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:11.020\n the winner take all took over.\n\n2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:15.380\n And here's a fundamentally different kind of like\n\n2:01:15.380 --> 2:01:18.700\n analog versus digital is a leap in technologies.\n\n2:01:18.700 --> 2:01:19.900\n That's right.\n\n2:01:19.900 --> 2:01:23.040\n And you're suggesting that there may not be,\n\n2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:29.100\n there's unlikely to be other leaps of that kind\n\n2:01:29.100 --> 2:01:32.260\n into a whole nother kind of space of technologies.\n\n2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:34.700\n I would argue that Bitcoin,\n\n2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:38.040\n it's kind of like the ideological synthesis of gold,\n\n2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:39.380\n taking the monetary properties of gold\n\n2:01:39.380 --> 2:01:41.860\n and combining them with the internet itself.\n\n2:01:41.860 --> 2:01:43.220\n And in doing so,\n\n2:01:43.220 --> 2:01:47.140\n it has essentially perfected the properties of money, right?\n\n2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:49.700\n You can't get more divisible, durable, recognizable,\n\n2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:51.780\n portable, or scarce than Bitcoin.\n\n2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:54.260\n So Satoshi has kind of,\n\n2:01:54.260 --> 2:01:58.360\n he left no design space for a superior technology\n\n2:01:58.360 --> 2:02:01.320\n to intercede and out compete Bitcoin at this point.\n\n2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:02.720\n Now that it's established liquidity\n\n2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.740\n in the network effects. Far superior technology, right?\n\n2:02:04.740 --> 2:02:07.340\n Yeah, but it's a combination of the tech itself\n\n2:02:07.340 --> 2:02:10.220\n and the social layer that is coalesced to it.\n\n2:02:10.220 --> 2:02:11.740\n You can't separate those two out.\n\n2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:15.020\n Like they're all connected and then the political as well.\n\n2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:17.460\n I mean, but the portability, for example,\n\n2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:20.060\n that's another way to phrase that is the,\n\n2:02:20.060 --> 2:02:22.000\n what is it, the scaling.\n\n2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.400\n So the number of transactions,\n\n2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:27.080\n that's a limitation for Bitcoin\n\n2:02:27.080 --> 2:02:30.880\n that many argue is a feature, many argue is a bug.\n\n2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:33.500\n You have a bunch of cryptocurrency technologies\n\n2:02:33.500 --> 2:02:37.020\n that are able to achieve much higher,\n\n2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:40.420\n much faster frequency of transactions,\n\n2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:43.500\n much more transactions, you know, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:02:44.700 --> 2:02:46.420\n What are your thoughts on that?\n\n2:02:47.380 --> 2:02:49.660\n You know, the low level of transactions\n\n2:02:49.660 --> 2:02:51.760\n that's possible with Bitcoin.\n\n2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:52.880\n Do you think that's a feature?\n\n2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:54.500\n Do you think that's a bug?\n\n2:02:54.500 --> 2:02:56.860\n Necessary for security actually.\n\n2:02:56.860 --> 2:03:00.280\n And even these other crypto assets that settle more quickly,\n\n2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:03.660\n they settle with less assurance of finality.\n\n2:03:03.660 --> 2:03:07.080\n So Nick Carter has a great piece on this actually called,\n\n2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:09.260\n the settlement assurance is stupid.\n\n2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:11.540\n It's really good where the gist of it is\n\n2:03:11.540 --> 2:03:16.540\n that there is more work being done in each block of Bitcoin\n\n2:03:16.780 --> 2:03:20.700\n that it can't, it is less vulnerable to reversion.\n\n2:03:20.700 --> 2:03:23.900\n So it's giving you higher degrees of assurance\n\n2:03:23.900 --> 2:03:26.040\n that your settlement or your trade has occurred\n\n2:03:26.040 --> 2:03:28.540\n with finality, whereas other blockchains\n\n2:03:28.540 --> 2:03:30.140\n are much more vulnerable.\n\n2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:35.780\n And again, with Bitcoin, the evolutionary path of money\n\n2:03:35.780 --> 2:03:40.600\n with gold is that it was first used as a collectible.\n\n2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:43.140\n It then became used as a store value.\n\n2:03:43.140 --> 2:03:44.740\n After it had stored enough value,\n\n2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:48.740\n it began to be used as a medium of exchange.\n\n2:03:48.740 --> 2:03:50.260\n And then finally, when it was used widely enough\n\n2:03:50.260 --> 2:03:52.580\n as a medium of exchange, it becomes a unit of account.\n\n2:03:52.580 --> 2:03:54.940\n We actually start to think in the money.\n\n2:03:54.940 --> 2:03:56.880\n Bitcoin's following a similar path.\n\n2:03:56.880 --> 2:04:00.420\n So started out as kind of a collectible.\n\n2:04:00.420 --> 2:04:02.260\n Today, I would argue it's a store value,\n\n2:04:02.260 --> 2:04:05.620\n one of the most effective store value we've ever seen.\n\n2:04:05.620 --> 2:04:08.580\n So that evolutionary path that Bitcoin's following\n\n2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:10.260\n is similar to gold.\n\n2:04:10.260 --> 2:04:12.260\n First a collectible, today a store value.\n\n2:04:12.260 --> 2:04:13.940\n To be an effective store value,\n\n2:04:13.940 --> 2:04:18.540\n it has to optimize for supply cap.\n\n2:04:18.540 --> 2:04:19.900\n That has to be the first,\n\n2:04:19.900 --> 2:04:22.300\n and this is all Bitcoin really needs to do\n\n2:04:22.300 --> 2:04:23.780\n to be successful by the way.\n\n2:04:23.780 --> 2:04:25.860\n Exactly what it's been doing for 12 years,\n\n2:04:25.860 --> 2:04:27.420\n virtually flawlessly,\n\n2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:30.340\n which is keep creating a block every 10 minutes\n\n2:04:30.340 --> 2:04:33.120\n and keep enforcing a supply cap of 21 million.\n\n2:04:34.020 --> 2:04:35.860\n As long as those two things hold,\n\n2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:40.620\n it is sound money, the ultimate sound money,\n\n2:04:40.620 --> 2:04:44.620\n the most inflation resistant money there's ever been.\n\n2:04:44.620 --> 2:04:47.800\n It's actually completely immune.\n\n2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:50.340\n It's taken unexpected inflation to 0%.\n\n2:04:50.340 --> 2:04:51.620\n We know with perfect certainty\n\n2:04:51.620 --> 2:04:53.420\n what Bitcoin supply will ever be.\n\n2:04:53.420 --> 2:04:58.420\n For it to be used more broadly as a medium of exchange,\n\n2:04:59.540 --> 2:05:02.260\n it can't make trade offs at the base layer\n\n2:05:02.260 --> 2:05:05.340\n to increase its portability for instance.\n\n2:05:05.340 --> 2:05:07.980\n Even though portability is maybe kind of a misnomer\n\n2:05:07.980 --> 2:05:10.620\n because Bitcoin has extremely high portability,\n\n2:05:10.620 --> 2:05:13.500\n just doesn't have extremely high transaction throughput.\n\n2:05:13.500 --> 2:05:16.680\n So we could say you can move it pretty quickly\n\n2:05:16.680 --> 2:05:17.520\n anywhere in the world\n\n2:05:17.520 --> 2:05:20.980\n as long as you're willing to bid up for the block space,\n\n2:05:20.980 --> 2:05:24.980\n but you can't satisfy all the world's economic volume.\n\n2:05:24.980 --> 2:05:27.100\n You can't do 300 million transactions per second\n\n2:05:27.100 --> 2:05:29.580\n like you can on a centralized database like Visa.\n\n2:05:30.700 --> 2:05:34.740\n But Bitcoin needs to be this,\n\n2:05:34.740 --> 2:05:36.380\n it has to be a store value first\n\n2:05:36.380 --> 2:05:38.740\n before it can be a medium of exchange.\n\n2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:42.620\n So it has to protect the supply cap first\n\n2:05:42.620 --> 2:05:44.340\n before making any trade offs for that.\n\n2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:48.340\n And I would argue that that's why Bitcoin is so rigid,\n\n2:05:48.340 --> 2:05:50.140\n is that it's optimized for survivability\n\n2:05:50.140 --> 2:05:51.720\n and optimized for that supply cap.\n\n2:05:51.720 --> 2:05:56.100\n And it's pushing experimentation and other features\n\n2:05:56.100 --> 2:05:57.760\n that would increase its transaction throughput\n\n2:05:57.760 --> 2:05:59.420\n to higher layers.\n\n2:05:59.420 --> 2:06:01.420\n So I think Lightning Network\n\n2:06:01.420 --> 2:06:03.460\n is something that's very interesting.\n\n2:06:03.460 --> 2:06:05.700\n It's still early,\n\n2:06:05.700 --> 2:06:08.660\n but there's a lot of throughput already being used\n\n2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:10.540\n on the Lightning Network.\n\n2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:14.260\n And it makes some slight trade offs\n\n2:06:14.260 --> 2:06:16.060\n in terms of the trust minimization of Bitcoin.\n\n2:06:16.060 --> 2:06:18.180\n You end up trusting these smart contracts\n\n2:06:18.180 --> 2:06:19.500\n instead of move the Bitcoin,\n\n2:06:19.500 --> 2:06:22.940\n but you pick up nearly unlimited transaction throughput.\n\n2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:25.620\n So that's how, and that's how biology evolves.\n\n2:06:25.620 --> 2:06:26.780\n That's how the internet evolved.\n\n2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:27.860\n It evolves in layers.\n\n2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:29.960\n So I think Bitcoin,\n\n2:06:29.960 --> 2:06:31.020\n you can sort of conceive of it\n\n2:06:31.020 --> 2:06:33.820\n as the latest layer to the internet.\n\n2:06:33.820 --> 2:06:36.860\n And it's one that preserves this store value property\n\n2:06:36.860 --> 2:06:38.920\n better than any asset we've ever had.\n\n2:06:38.920 --> 2:06:41.820\n Let me ask sort of a critical question of,\n\n2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:46.060\n if you're wrong about your statements about Bitcoin,\n\n2:06:46.060 --> 2:06:51.060\n and you find out years from now that you were wrong,\n\n2:06:51.860 --> 2:06:53.140\n what would that look like?\n\n2:06:54.020 --> 2:06:55.300\n What would be the things\n\n2:06:55.300 --> 2:06:57.520\n that make you realize you were wrong?\n\n2:06:57.520 --> 2:07:01.320\n Likely ideas or crazy out there ideas?\n\n2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:03.180\n Do you think about this kind of stuff?\n\n2:07:03.180 --> 2:07:04.020\n All the time.\n\n2:07:04.020 --> 2:07:08.480\n Because you speak very confidently about Bitcoin.\n\n2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:11.580\n And one of the things, let me put it this way.\n\n2:07:11.580 --> 2:07:13.440\n I think certainty,\n\n2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:16.640\n I feel like that's like a stoic statement.\n\n2:07:16.640 --> 2:07:19.800\n Certainty leads to ruin, something like that.\n\n2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:24.800\n Like certainty, I think is an antithesis to progress often.\n\n2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:28.260\n And especially in your writing,\n\n2:07:28.260 --> 2:07:29.920\n but this is true for the Bitcoin community.\n\n2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:34.920\n There's a certainty about the Bitcoin.\n\n2:07:34.960 --> 2:07:36.860\n And that makes me very skeptical,\n\n2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:38.880\n no matter how good the ideas are.\n\n2:07:38.880 --> 2:07:42.220\n Whenever things are good, this might be the Russian in me.\n\n2:07:42.220 --> 2:07:46.160\n I think like, what are the ways this is gonna go wrong?\n\n2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:48.800\n So what do you think are the ways this might go wrong\n\n2:07:48.800 --> 2:07:53.040\n or you're wrong in your conception of what Bitcoin is?\n\n2:07:53.040 --> 2:07:58.040\n Yeah, so science evolves via negativa,\n\n2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:04.200\n meaning that we're not proving hypotheses\n\n2:08:04.200 --> 2:08:06.940\n and that's what becomes the body of science.\n\n2:08:06.940 --> 2:08:11.940\n Science is whatever is left over as we disprove hypotheses.\n\n2:08:12.540 --> 2:08:17.340\n Whatever we can empirically, through experimentation,\n\n2:08:17.340 --> 2:08:19.680\n disprove, gets discarded.\n\n2:08:19.680 --> 2:08:23.180\n And whatever remains, whatever theory remains,\n\n2:08:23.180 --> 2:08:26.660\n it hasn't been disproven, is science, effectively.\n\n2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:33.500\n This process is similar to market actors zeroing in\n\n2:08:33.600 --> 2:08:35.620\n on a store value, right?\n\n2:08:35.620 --> 2:08:37.760\n They're experimenting with different forms\n\n2:08:37.760 --> 2:08:41.180\n of storing wealth across time.\n\n2:08:41.180 --> 2:08:42.540\n Some do better than others\n\n2:08:42.540 --> 2:08:45.540\n and eventually everyone ends up on the one that is best.\n\n2:08:45.540 --> 2:08:46.800\n That's what gold was.\n\n2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:51.280\n In terms of understanding Bitcoin,\n\n2:08:51.280 --> 2:08:53.460\n I look at it as a similar approach.\n\n2:08:53.460 --> 2:08:55.660\n And that is the main question I'm asking myself\n\n2:08:55.660 --> 2:08:57.580\n is how do you stop this thing?\n\n2:08:57.580 --> 2:08:59.220\n How do you turn it off?\n\n2:08:59.220 --> 2:09:00.060\n How do you end it?\n\n2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:02.220\n If you're a nation state, particularly,\n\n2:09:02.220 --> 2:09:05.220\n who has the most to lose in this transition,\n\n2:09:05.220 --> 2:09:08.500\n what is the attack vector by which they neutralize Bitcoin?\n\n2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:12.140\n I mean, that is the $250 trillion question.\n\n2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:16.580\n And I've spent five years thinking about this thing\n\n2:09:16.580 --> 2:09:17.420\n very deeply.\n\n2:09:17.420 --> 2:09:19.400\n I've read everything on monetary history.\n\n2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:20.760\n I can get my hands on.\n\n2:09:23.660 --> 2:09:27.860\n The general thought of how it is stopped,\n\n2:09:27.860 --> 2:09:31.300\n and this is the snag point that a lot of people get to\n\n2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:32.820\n in their explorations down the rabbit hole,\n\n2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:35.180\n is they just say the government will never allow it.\n\n2:09:35.180 --> 2:09:36.580\n And that becomes kind of their bottom.\n\n2:09:36.580 --> 2:09:37.800\n It's like, all right, Bitcoin's interesting,\n\n2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:39.140\n it's superior money, blah, blah, blah,\n\n2:09:39.140 --> 2:09:40.780\n but the government will never allow it.\n\n2:09:40.780 --> 2:09:41.620\n And they say.\n\n2:09:41.620 --> 2:09:43.340\n Was Ray Dalio, did he say that?\n\n2:09:43.340 --> 2:09:45.800\n Dalio was currently stuck there, yeah.\n\n2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:50.800\n So Ray Dalio said that Bitcoin seems to be too promising.\n\n2:09:52.580 --> 2:09:55.880\n If it is in fact as promising as it looks,\n\n2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:58.260\n governments are going to,\n\n2:09:59.260 --> 2:10:00.860\n I don't forget what the exact quote is,\n\n2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:02.280\n but not allowed.\n\n2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:03.660\n Ban it.\n\n2:10:03.660 --> 2:10:05.300\n Governments will ban it.\n\n2:10:05.300 --> 2:10:09.940\n So how do you get Ray Dalio unstuck from your perspective?\n\n2:10:09.940 --> 2:10:10.780\n Well.\n\n2:10:10.780 --> 2:10:12.740\n And how do you get unstuck from that idea\n\n2:10:12.740 --> 2:10:14.860\n that governments, will governments,\n\n2:10:14.860 --> 2:10:18.440\n how do you prevent governments from stopping a thing\n\n2:10:18.440 --> 2:10:21.280\n that threatens centralized power?\n\n2:10:22.580 --> 2:10:24.500\n Well, Bitcoin is an idea.\n\n2:10:26.060 --> 2:10:30.300\n So governments that are really good\n\n2:10:30.300 --> 2:10:35.060\n at fighting centralized threats to their power, right?\n\n2:10:35.060 --> 2:10:36.700\n Whether that's a currency counterfeiter\n\n2:10:36.700 --> 2:10:40.400\n or competing nation state or business they don't like,\n\n2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:42.500\n or an individual they don't like,\n\n2:10:42.500 --> 2:10:44.940\n you know, they can kill them, they can throw them in jail.\n\n2:10:44.940 --> 2:10:46.700\n They can use any number of course\n\n2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:49.300\n of a violent tactics to suppress it.\n\n2:10:49.300 --> 2:10:52.600\n But how do you point a gun at an idea?\n\n2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.580\n How do you coerce an idea?\n\n2:10:56.580 --> 2:11:01.580\n And that's, you know, there's some anecdotal history here\n\n2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:08.400\n where there's the PGP case, which in the United States,\n\n2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:12.320\n the court was trying to classify it as munitions.\n\n2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:13.920\n When we were shipping this\n\n2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:17.920\n pretty good privacy software overseas,\n\n2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:19.440\n government wanted to classify it as munitions\n\n2:11:19.440 --> 2:11:21.140\n and restrict that exportation.\n\n2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:25.320\n But, and this was a circuit court case precedent.\n\n2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:30.000\n When the PGP attorneys actually printed out the source code\n\n2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:33.560\n on paper and presented it as evidence in the court,\n\n2:11:33.560 --> 2:11:36.400\n all of a sudden it became protected under freedom of speech\n\n2:11:36.400 --> 2:11:40.360\n and that it's just code is speech, code is language.\n\n2:11:40.360 --> 2:11:43.080\n And therefore, at least in the United States,\n\n2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:45.080\n it's protected under the first amendment.\n\n2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:52.760\n I think a government ban would be largely unenforceable,\n\n2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:54.560\n frankly, on Bitcoin.\n\n2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:56.920\n Being that it's pure information,\n\n2:11:56.920 --> 2:12:00.440\n if you suppress market actors\n\n2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:02.160\n from using it in one jurisdiction,\n\n2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:05.860\n you're just creating incentives for them to go elsewhere.\n\n2:12:05.860 --> 2:12:07.440\n And you're actually increasing the incentive\n\n2:12:07.440 --> 2:12:11.320\n for other jurisdictions to be favorable towards it\n\n2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:12.880\n because then they can create,\n\n2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:14.480\n they get to benefit from the tax revenue\n\n2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:16.400\n and the businesses and the innovation\n\n2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:19.360\n that's occurring in and around Bitcoin as a result.\n\n2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:21.920\n So you don't think if a particular central bank,\n\n2:12:21.920 --> 2:12:25.040\n like in Europe or United States,\n\n2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:28.440\n bans it, not maybe using those terms,\n\n2:12:28.440 --> 2:12:30.440\n but in some kind of way,\n\n2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:32.760\n you think that provides a really strong incentive\n\n2:12:32.760 --> 2:12:36.320\n for the other big players to enable it.\n\n2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:37.160\n That's right.\n\n2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:40.640\n And that they're more likely, by the way,\n\n2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:42.560\n and governments know this, by the way, too.\n\n2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:46.160\n The other thing that causes a government\n\n2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:48.320\n to shoot itself in the foot is that if they ban something,\n\n2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:50.520\n they draw a lot of attention to it.\n\n2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:51.520\n People are smart.\n\n2:12:51.520 --> 2:12:53.920\n I mean, people ask why, why would a government ban it?\n\n2:12:53.920 --> 2:12:55.220\n Why can't I use this?\n\n2:12:55.220 --> 2:12:57.640\n So that's kind of typically be the last arrow\n\n2:12:57.640 --> 2:12:58.480\n in their quiver.\n\n2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:02.280\n They may try to ban it if Bitcoin\n\n2:13:02.280 --> 2:13:04.080\n really starts to monetize very quickly.\n\n2:13:04.080 --> 2:13:06.640\n And the power structures that they impose today\n\n2:13:06.640 --> 2:13:11.640\n start to dissolve faster than others might think they will,\n\n2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:13.440\n then they might try and ban it.\n\n2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:16.660\n But I think that ban will be largely unenforceable.\n\n2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:19.480\n They're more likely to tax it,\n\n2:13:19.480 --> 2:13:21.480\n which they already do tax it.\n\n2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:23.600\n They're likely to increase taxation of it.\n\n2:13:25.480 --> 2:13:28.520\n They're likely to try and make it more white market\n\n2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:32.400\n by actually tracing Bitcoin, seeing who has it,\n\n2:13:32.400 --> 2:13:35.040\n attaching identities to Bitcoin ownership,\n\n2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:38.280\n and making sure that they're getting their pound of flesh\n\n2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:41.600\n on all the transactions it results in.\n\n2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:45.760\n But I don't think, the other thing about this is,\n\n2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:50.500\n so we saw the internet outcompete intranets,\n\n2:13:53.000 --> 2:13:55.200\n in that we'd say that open source networks\n\n2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:57.100\n tend to outcompete closed source networks.\n\n2:13:57.100 --> 2:13:59.320\n And there's a really good reason for this.\n\n2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:02.260\n And it's because in a closed source network,\n\n2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:06.980\n there are costs associated with defending the network itself.\n\n2:14:08.180 --> 2:14:12.180\n So you have to, the network owners,\n\n2:14:12.180 --> 2:14:13.460\n the owners of the closed source network\n\n2:14:13.460 --> 2:14:17.560\n have to expend resources protecting it from competitors.\n\n2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:21.000\n And they have to expend resources imposing its rules\n\n2:14:21.000 --> 2:14:23.220\n because they're not voluntarily adopted rules.\n\n2:14:23.220 --> 2:14:25.380\n So you actually have to impose these rule sets.\n\n2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:26.880\n Whereas an open source network,\n\n2:14:26.880 --> 2:14:29.160\n which is something much more akin to capitalism\n\n2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:33.000\n in its pure sense, these are voluntarily adopted rules.\n\n2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:34.880\n So all market participants have agreed\n\n2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:36.720\n and consented to this rule set.\n\n2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:38.400\n So there's no enforcement costs\n\n2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:39.620\n and there's no turf protection\n\n2:14:39.620 --> 2:14:43.000\n because anyone can freely enter or exit the open network.\n\n2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:45.020\n For that energetic reason,\n\n2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:50.020\n I think open networks outcompete close networks typically.\n\n2:14:50.520 --> 2:14:53.560\n And in the digital age, that's why I think open,\n\n2:14:53.560 --> 2:14:55.200\n that's why internet outcompetes intranet\n\n2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:57.240\n and that's why open source networks\n\n2:14:57.240 --> 2:14:58.840\n are gonna eat closed source networks.\n\n2:14:58.840 --> 2:15:01.180\n So what Bitcoin would be in that lens\n\n2:15:01.180 --> 2:15:04.220\n is the ultimate open source monetary network\n\n2:15:04.220 --> 2:15:08.460\n devouring closed source central bank monetary networks.\n\n2:15:08.460 --> 2:15:13.460\n And I just don't see how there's no possibility\n\n2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:17.560\n of unilaterally stopping Bitcoin or destroying it.\n\n2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:21.480\n So then they're more likely to regulate or tax it.\n\n2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:25.160\n And again, the other fallacy here\n\n2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:26.780\n is that a lot of people tend to think of governments\n\n2:15:26.780 --> 2:15:30.760\n as these singular indivisible entities,\n\n2:15:30.760 --> 2:15:32.920\n like they just move under one plan.\n\n2:15:32.920 --> 2:15:34.960\n But in reality, it's a lot of people, right?\n\n2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.880\n A lot of people with loosely coupled interests\n\n2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:41.880\n and agendas and whatnot, regulators and others\n\n2:15:43.080 --> 2:15:45.640\n whether wearing their citizen hat,\n\n2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:47.320\n they're gonna see this thing monetizing,\n\n2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:48.640\n they're gonna be on the front lines\n\n2:15:48.640 --> 2:15:52.120\n of trying to regulate it, trying to control it.\n\n2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:53.480\n And I think what's likely to happen\n\n2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:55.600\n is they're gonna start to adopt it,\n\n2:15:55.600 --> 2:15:59.480\n to buy some of it even as an individual\n\n2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:02.040\n or possibly even ultimately at a central bank\n\n2:16:02.040 --> 2:16:03.760\n or sovereign wealth fund level,\n\n2:16:03.760 --> 2:16:07.200\n as an insurance policy against its success.\n\n2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:09.640\n And once you start to acquire something\n\n2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:12.760\n and then you have a vested economic interest\n\n2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:14.360\n in its monetization,\n\n2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:17.560\n I think it kind of dissolves any of the power structures\n\n2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:20.520\n that are arrayed against it from the inside.\n\n2:16:20.520 --> 2:16:22.720\n So I've written a lot about this\n\n2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:24.480\n in a new series called Sovereignism,\n\n2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:26.640\n which is based loosely on a book\n\n2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:28.760\n called The Sovereign Individual.\n\n2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.240\n And that's the general thesis\n\n2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:34.080\n is that microprocessing technology would devour\n\n2:16:34.080 --> 2:16:35.780\n our organizational models,\n\n2:16:35.780 --> 2:16:38.300\n the most important of which is the nation state.\n\n2:16:38.300 --> 2:16:39.960\n So I think we're going into this world\n\n2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:44.420\n where coercion and violence is just much less rewarding.\n\n2:16:47.600 --> 2:16:50.380\n The economics of violence are declining\n\n2:16:50.380 --> 2:16:54.460\n because of the low cost of protecting property, right?\n\n2:16:54.460 --> 2:16:59.460\n You can now protect your monetary property in Bitcoin\n\n2:16:59.460 --> 2:17:01.800\n at orders of magnitude less cost\n\n2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:04.020\n than is necessary to run a banking network.\n\n2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:09.020\n So it changes the way we organize ourselves.\n\n2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:12.240\n And again, zooming back to gold\n\n2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:14.740\n as kind of the original governor to governments,\n\n2:17:14.740 --> 2:17:16.200\n where if they manipulated the money,\n\n2:17:16.200 --> 2:17:18.040\n gold would leave their country.\n\n2:17:18.040 --> 2:17:23.040\n That's why governments have taken relatively concerted action\n\n2:17:23.180 --> 2:17:25.320\n to go off of the gold standard.\n\n2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:27.720\n There's a great book on this called The Gold Wars\n\n2:17:27.720 --> 2:17:32.120\n that outlines how governments have been waging\n\n2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:34.820\n a cold war against gold for the past 50 years.\n\n2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:39.240\n Bitcoin sort of renews hope\n\n2:17:39.240 --> 2:17:41.600\n for that free market governor of governments.\n\n2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:42.860\n And that is this digital gold\n\n2:17:42.860 --> 2:17:45.520\n that governments cannot stop or coopt.\n\n2:17:45.520 --> 2:17:47.680\n So I think it's something,\n\n2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:49.480\n that's why I think it's such a big deal\n\n2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:54.480\n is that it is changing,\n\n2:17:54.480 --> 2:17:56.800\n it's a new useful fiction, you might say.\n\n2:17:56.800 --> 2:17:58.600\n A useful fiction that's superordinate\n\n2:17:58.600 --> 2:18:02.240\n to the mythology of the nation state and government\n\n2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:04.240\n as the dominant institution in the world.\n\n2:18:04.240 --> 2:18:05.400\n Well, I hope you're right\n\n2:18:05.400 --> 2:18:08.920\n that all forms of centralized power\n\n2:18:10.400 --> 2:18:12.660\n start breaking apart naturally.\n\n2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:14.960\n So governments, the more and more power\n\n2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:18.400\n is given to the individual, whatever the technology is.\n\n2:18:18.400 --> 2:18:20.720\n And Bitcoin seems to be a promising technology\n\n2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:22.880\n that empowers that, enables that.\n\n2:18:22.880 --> 2:18:24.720\n That seems to be the trend.\n\n2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:26.320\n And that's a promising trend\n\n2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.120\n at least from a perspective of somebody\n\n2:18:29.120 --> 2:18:33.400\n who values this particular biological meat bag\n\n2:18:33.400 --> 2:18:34.800\n that's full of consciousness.\n\n2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:37.680\n I think Bitcoin is exposing the greatest scam\n\n2:18:37.680 --> 2:18:40.720\n in human history, which is political authority.\n\n2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:43.860\n Like who gives anyone the right to be politically,\n\n2:18:43.860 --> 2:18:46.100\n have political authority over anyone else?\n\n2:18:46.100 --> 2:18:49.040\n People should be free to adopt the rules\n\n2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:52.040\n and systems and tools that best suit their needs.\n\n2:18:52.040 --> 2:18:56.180\n And that arc of history we covered earlier\n\n2:18:56.180 --> 2:19:01.180\n where as socioeconomic systems have become more favorable\n\n2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:03.440\n towards individual sovereignty,\n\n2:19:03.440 --> 2:19:06.120\n the more wealthy we have become,\n\n2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:07.880\n the more we have given the individual,\n\n2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:10.520\n we've maximized individual choice,\n\n2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:12.440\n the more wealth that society has created\n\n2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:14.460\n and the more it has out competed\n\n2:19:14.460 --> 2:19:15.840\n the systems that have come before it.\n\n2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:19.360\n The latest would be capitalism triumphing over socialism.\n\n2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:23.920\n Before maybe we eat, you are in Texas,\n\n2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:25.720\n you brought over some brisket.\n\n2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:28.000\n Before we may be indulge in that,\n\n2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:30.000\n let me bring up one quick topic\n\n2:19:30.000 --> 2:19:31.680\n and then we'll take a break.\n\n2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:35.720\n And the topic of what some may term\n\n2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:37.760\n the toxicity of the Bitcoin community.\n\n2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:43.200\n You've written that Bitcoin toxicity is tough love.\n\n2:19:44.400 --> 2:19:46.660\n Do you wanna break that apart a little bit\n\n2:19:46.660 --> 2:19:51.660\n sort of the idea, the philosophy of the toxicity\n\n2:19:51.660 --> 2:19:56.660\n that seems to be present in part in the Bitcoin community?\n\n2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:01.380\n Yeah, we were talking about this a little bit\n\n2:20:01.380 --> 2:20:04.780\n before we recorded and I've been through the gauntlet\n\n2:20:04.780 --> 2:20:06.700\n with Bitcoin toxicity as well.\n\n2:20:07.580 --> 2:20:12.580\n I came into this space professionally in 2017.\n\n2:20:12.940 --> 2:20:15.000\n I was originally running a multi strategy\n\n2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:17.160\n crypto asset hedge fund.\n\n2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:21.620\n And my initial investment thesis on the world\n\n2:20:21.620 --> 2:20:23.260\n was that Bitcoin was a big deal,\n\n2:20:23.260 --> 2:20:25.220\n but there were all these other exciting coins\n\n2:20:25.220 --> 2:20:28.880\n and projects and ways the technology was going to be used.\n\n2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:33.880\n And that view of reality met this immune,\n\n2:20:35.420 --> 2:20:37.980\n I guess you could say as an ideological immune system,\n\n2:20:37.980 --> 2:20:40.940\n this Bitcoin toxicity and that it's kind of a filter\n\n2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:45.460\n that's trying to catch bad or useless\n\n2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:50.460\n or even scamming ideas that this space is very well known for.\n\n2:20:52.860 --> 2:20:55.180\n As we've touched on today, Bitcoin, in my opinion,\n\n2:20:55.180 --> 2:20:57.940\n is this world shattering innovation,\n\n2:20:57.940 --> 2:21:01.500\n but it's in a sea of the most scammy stuff ever, right?\n\n2:21:01.500 --> 2:21:04.360\n People, anybody can go and create a coin.\n\n2:21:05.460 --> 2:21:08.340\n So you can go and launch one immediately online\n\n2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:12.860\n and you can throw up a website, an advisor page,\n\n2:21:14.020 --> 2:21:15.060\n post a white paper talking about\n\n2:21:15.060 --> 2:21:16.500\n how great your technology is gonna be\n\n2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:17.640\n and how it's gonna change the world.\n\n2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:20.240\n And then you can raise $30 million in Bitcoin\n\n2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:22.660\n or Ethereum in 30 seconds kind of thing.\n\n2:21:22.660 --> 2:21:27.500\n So it's drawn in a lot of this scam artistry, you might say.\n\n2:21:27.500 --> 2:21:31.180\n And I think people living through that,\n\n2:21:31.180 --> 2:21:33.500\n because there is this natural predilection for people\n\n2:21:33.500 --> 2:21:35.920\n when they first come into Bitcoin, you're excited about it,\n\n2:21:35.920 --> 2:21:39.460\n then you get lost in the shit coin universe.\n\n2:21:39.460 --> 2:21:43.340\n And then just looking at the market success\n\n2:21:43.340 --> 2:21:46.060\n of Bitcoin versus, and when I use the word shit coin,\n\n2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:47.040\n I'm just.\n\n2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:49.020\n You say with all the love in the world.\n\n2:21:49.020 --> 2:21:50.660\n All the love in the world.\n\n2:21:50.660 --> 2:21:53.180\n I guess you could call me a toxic maximalist in some ways,\n\n2:21:53.180 --> 2:21:55.420\n although I consider myself a freedom maximalist,\n\n2:21:55.420 --> 2:21:56.260\n not a Bitcoin maximalist.\n\n2:21:56.260 --> 2:21:59.740\n Yeah, I saw that line, that's a good line.\n\n2:21:59.740 --> 2:22:03.100\n Bitcoin, tracking the market success of Bitcoin\n\n2:22:03.100 --> 2:22:05.300\n versus alternative crypto assets,\n\n2:22:06.300 --> 2:22:07.400\n the signal is very clear\n\n2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:09.480\n that Bitcoin has out competed all of them.\n\n2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:13.140\n So I think that Bitcoin cultural toxicity has evolved\n\n2:22:13.140 --> 2:22:15.620\n as an immune response to those bad ideas,\n\n2:22:15.620 --> 2:22:17.780\n which is actually, if you think about it,\n\n2:22:17.780 --> 2:22:19.100\n kind of is a tough love, right?\n\n2:22:19.100 --> 2:22:21.660\n You don't want new entrance to the space\n\n2:22:21.660 --> 2:22:26.140\n to get lost in shit coin jungle and learn the hard way,\n\n2:22:26.140 --> 2:22:28.060\n the way many Bitcoin maximalists have\n\n2:22:28.060 --> 2:22:31.320\n that the real innovation is Bitcoin.\n\n2:22:31.320 --> 2:22:36.320\n But like an immune system, I think it can also go too far.\n\n2:22:36.500 --> 2:22:40.840\n And so I think it's useful when it is defending the space\n\n2:22:40.840 --> 2:22:43.460\n from false narratives, we might say,\n\n2:22:43.460 --> 2:22:48.180\n but it becomes detrimental when it's attacking people\n\n2:22:48.180 --> 2:22:50.080\n that are inquiring about Bitcoin\n\n2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:52.240\n or people that are approaching Bitcoin\n\n2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:54.860\n with a good spirit and good intention\n\n2:22:54.860 --> 2:22:57.420\n and a desire to learn.\n\n2:22:57.420 --> 2:22:58.340\n Because then at that point,\n\n2:22:58.340 --> 2:23:01.720\n it's actually impeding the free flow of ideas,\n\n2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:04.580\n which the example in your clip\n\n2:23:04.580 --> 2:23:06.500\n that was totally taken out of context.\n\n2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:07.940\n And then you're literally just saying,\n\n2:23:07.940 --> 2:23:09.240\n I'm here to learn and contribute.\n\n2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:10.780\n I think I've got some stuff to do.\n\n2:23:10.780 --> 2:23:11.860\n And then people attack that.\n\n2:23:11.860 --> 2:23:13.900\n Like that doesn't make any fucking sense.\n\n2:23:13.900 --> 2:23:16.140\n It's like you're attacking someone who's approaching it\n\n2:23:16.140 --> 2:23:18.380\n in a good spirit and asking questions.\n\n2:23:18.380 --> 2:23:21.480\n Yeah, and I think sometimes talking about it,\n\n2:23:22.660 --> 2:23:25.580\n the toxicity in the Bitcoin community as an immune response\n\n2:23:26.440 --> 2:23:29.540\n has a negative effect of giving it a pass\n\n2:23:30.740 --> 2:23:32.620\n because like it almost says,\n\n2:23:32.620 --> 2:23:35.940\n look, it equates it with the human immune system,\n\n2:23:35.940 --> 2:23:38.620\n which seems to do a really good job.\n\n2:23:38.620 --> 2:23:42.500\n And so you could say that the toxicity has a lot of features\n\n2:23:42.500 --> 2:23:47.500\n in the sea of fraudulent projects\n\n2:23:47.780 --> 2:23:52.180\n that steal money from people.\n\n2:23:52.180 --> 2:23:53.860\n It's really useful to make sure\n\n2:23:53.860 --> 2:23:56.420\n that you give people the harsh truth\n\n2:23:56.420 --> 2:23:58.540\n about who is and isn't a scammer.\n\n2:24:00.020 --> 2:24:02.260\n You have to take it apart,\n\n2:24:02.260 --> 2:24:04.460\n take it away from that metaphor of the immune system\n\n2:24:04.460 --> 2:24:06.620\n and look at basic human nature.\n\n2:24:06.620 --> 2:24:09.180\n And human nature can go to some dark places,\n\n2:24:09.180 --> 2:24:14.180\n which is it's sad to say that some people,\n\n2:24:15.220 --> 2:24:20.220\n maybe many of us can enjoy for its own sake, the toxicity,\n\n2:24:21.060 --> 2:24:23.300\n the mockery, the derision,\n\n2:24:23.300 --> 2:24:27.940\n and you stop being part of the immune system\n\n2:24:27.940 --> 2:24:31.000\n that makes a successful idea propagate\n\n2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:35.120\n and start being a sort of a destructive virus yourself.\n\n2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:37.740\n And that's something I think about\n\n2:24:37.740 --> 2:24:42.740\n because I am new to this particular immune system,\n\n2:24:43.140 --> 2:24:45.980\n but I've explored other immune systems.\n\n2:24:45.980 --> 2:24:50.980\n And I think you understand this world much better than me,\n\n2:24:54.820 --> 2:24:57.780\n but I tend to prefer sort of love\n\n2:24:57.780 --> 2:25:00.340\n as a mechanism for spreading ideas,\n\n2:25:00.340 --> 2:25:05.340\n to err on the side of love and kindness\n\n2:25:06.220 --> 2:25:09.300\n and almost like an open mindedness\n\n2:25:09.300 --> 2:25:13.180\n in a way where you're constantly lowering yourself\n\n2:25:13.180 --> 2:25:16.880\n in the face of other ideas, constantly questioning yourself.\n\n2:25:17.820 --> 2:25:22.820\n But I think I understand that that might be more applicable\n\n2:25:24.180 --> 2:25:25.180\n in certain contexts,\n\n2:25:25.180 --> 2:25:28.080\n like maybe in the space of science or something like that.\n\n2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:31.260\n But in the space of Bitcoin, as it currently stands,\n\n2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:33.980\n there's so many people that are trying to scam others\n\n2:25:33.980 --> 2:25:35.580\n out of their money\n\n2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:39.100\n that the kind of harshness required is different.\n\n2:25:39.100 --> 2:25:44.100\n Nevertheless, I do want to put it on people like yourself\n\n2:25:45.060 --> 2:25:48.180\n and others who I know you wouldn't consider yourself this,\n\n2:25:48.180 --> 2:25:51.460\n but you're one of the faces or leaders in this space\n\n2:25:51.460 --> 2:25:53.660\n to call people out a little bit,\n\n2:25:53.660 --> 2:25:57.220\n to inspire them to be more loving, I suppose.\n\n2:25:57.220 --> 2:25:58.140\n But it's difficult,\n\n2:25:58.140 --> 2:26:00.260\n because you want to walk that line carefully.\n\n2:26:00.260 --> 2:26:03.260\n You don't want to be too loving and open minded,\n\n2:26:03.260 --> 2:26:04.540\n otherwise your brain falls out.\n\n2:26:04.540 --> 2:26:06.980\n I get it, it's a difficult balance to walk.\n\n2:26:06.980 --> 2:26:11.140\n It is subtle and it's nuanced and it is difficult to walk.\n\n2:26:11.140 --> 2:26:14.220\n And I think that, that's why I try to say tough love,\n\n2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:19.220\n because when we're young, we may have certain ideas\n\n2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:21.620\n about the way we want our life to go,\n\n2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:22.980\n but then maybe our parents\n\n2:26:22.980 --> 2:26:25.300\n are not letting us do certain things.\n\n2:26:25.300 --> 2:26:27.260\n And we think they're, I know when I was a kid,\n\n2:26:27.260 --> 2:26:28.620\n I wanted to get my, when I was in fifth grade,\n\n2:26:28.620 --> 2:26:30.220\n I wanted to get my ear pierced.\n\n2:26:30.220 --> 2:26:31.580\n My mom wouldn't let me do it.\n\n2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:34.460\n And I was, oh, come on, mom, I thought it was so cool.\n\n2:26:34.460 --> 2:26:36.700\n And then two years later, I'm like, thank you, mom,\n\n2:26:36.700 --> 2:26:38.340\n for letting me get my ear pierced.\n\n2:26:39.460 --> 2:26:41.700\n I think it comes from a place of good intention\n\n2:26:41.700 --> 2:26:43.400\n that they are actually,\n\n2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:46.780\n they have asked themselves that question, right?\n\n2:26:46.780 --> 2:26:48.660\n That they've been inquiring\n\n2:26:48.660 --> 2:26:51.940\n in why not this crypto asset or this crypto asset?\n\n2:26:51.940 --> 2:26:53.380\n And they've done the exploration,\n\n2:26:53.380 --> 2:26:54.940\n they keep coming back to Bitcoin\n\n2:26:54.940 --> 2:26:57.840\n and they've seen people being taken advantage of.\n\n2:26:59.580 --> 2:27:03.880\n But to your point, it's like it can,\n\n2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:06.780\n this tough love can become detrimental,\n\n2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:08.980\n just like the immune system can become detrimental, right?\n\n2:27:08.980 --> 2:27:12.420\n It can overreact and it can actually harm the human body.\n\n2:27:12.420 --> 2:27:16.220\n So I would say that it's such a tricky and nuanced topic\n\n2:27:16.220 --> 2:27:18.180\n that even biology hasn't figured it out, right?\n\n2:27:18.180 --> 2:27:20.180\n A lot of people have autoimmune diseases.\n\n2:27:21.980 --> 2:27:22.820\n And then there's the other thing\n\n2:27:22.820 --> 2:27:25.780\n that we have this natural, I agree with you about love.\n\n2:27:25.780 --> 2:27:28.660\n I think love is like the deepest value.\n\n2:27:28.660 --> 2:27:30.540\n That's a whole nother philosophical thing,\n\n2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:35.540\n but we're biologically programmed to pay more attention\n\n2:27:36.260 --> 2:27:38.860\n to things that are adversarial or harmful, right?\n\n2:27:38.860 --> 2:27:42.340\n That's part of us protecting the meat suit, so to speak.\n\n2:27:42.340 --> 2:27:47.340\n So there is some maybe better delivery method\n\n2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:50.980\n by being a little bit toxic to really get the point across,\n\n2:27:50.980 --> 2:27:53.580\n like, hey, don't get lost over here.\n\n2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:55.580\n These things can hurt you.\n\n2:27:55.580 --> 2:27:57.140\n Really try to focus on Bitcoin.\n\n2:27:57.140 --> 2:27:59.620\n But the toxicity of that message,\n\n2:27:59.620 --> 2:28:01.100\n I guess it increases its ability\n\n2:28:01.100 --> 2:28:04.140\n to penetrate the individual, but it can also go too far.\n\n2:28:04.140 --> 2:28:05.220\n So it is very...\n\n2:28:05.220 --> 2:28:08.780\n It's interesting, but I almost to push back a little bit,\n\n2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:11.100\n toxicity is a funny word.\n\n2:28:11.100 --> 2:28:15.540\n I think maybe another way to say it is,\n\n2:28:15.540 --> 2:28:17.660\n I brought up like Christopher Hitchens\n\n2:28:17.660 --> 2:28:20.980\n and somebody who like, okay,\n\n2:28:20.980 --> 2:28:23.660\n you might say he's toxic or something like that,\n\n2:28:23.660 --> 2:28:27.100\n because he's basically a intellectual powerhouse\n\n2:28:27.100 --> 2:28:28.740\n who's also a troll.\n\n2:28:28.740 --> 2:28:31.140\n So he's constantly, it's like guerrilla warfare\n\n2:28:31.140 --> 2:28:33.340\n in the space of ideas.\n\n2:28:33.340 --> 2:28:37.020\n He's very harsh in his disagreements and criticisms,\n\n2:28:37.020 --> 2:28:42.020\n but he's done with incredible grace and skill and poetry.\n\n2:28:42.260 --> 2:28:43.180\n So...\n\n2:28:43.180 --> 2:28:44.380\n We could use more of that.\n\n2:28:44.380 --> 2:28:45.780\n We could use more of that.\n\n2:28:45.780 --> 2:28:49.140\n So toxicity just like...\n\n2:28:52.540 --> 2:28:53.540\n These are just words.\n\n2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:55.180\n They can mean a lot of different things,\n\n2:28:55.180 --> 2:28:59.060\n but disagreement doesn't have to be done with love,\n\n2:28:59.940 --> 2:29:04.340\n but it should be done with skill if it's to be effective.\n\n2:29:04.340 --> 2:29:08.300\n So there's a lot of ways to be effective in guerrilla warfare,\n\n2:29:08.300 --> 2:29:10.180\n but you wanna learn how to shoot\n\n2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:12.820\n or whatever the weapon you're using and to do it well.\n\n2:29:12.820 --> 2:29:14.540\n Some people do it better than others.\n\n2:29:14.540 --> 2:29:17.780\n And it's worthwhile to learn to do it well.\n\n2:29:17.780 --> 2:29:20.140\n Again, I prefer love, but even love,\n\n2:29:21.180 --> 2:29:25.420\n just because you think you're communicating a good idea,\n\n2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:26.740\n which you very well may be,\n\n2:29:26.740 --> 2:29:28.820\n doesn't mean it also doesn't require skill\n\n2:29:28.820 --> 2:29:30.260\n to do the communication well,\n\n2:29:30.260 --> 2:29:33.220\n whether it's disagreement and harsh\n\n2:29:33.220 --> 2:29:36.860\n or more agreement and loving and so on.\n\n2:29:36.860 --> 2:29:41.860\n Yeah, I think very fundamentally that all of our decisions,\n\n2:29:41.860 --> 2:29:44.500\n we alluded to earlier that every decision\n\n2:29:44.500 --> 2:29:47.100\n is an expression of value, every action we take,\n\n2:29:47.100 --> 2:29:49.380\n they ultimately come from fear or love.\n\n2:29:49.380 --> 2:29:53.660\n Fear would be something much more in the biological domain\n\n2:29:53.660 --> 2:29:56.820\n where it's like, we're trying to protect ego,\n\n2:29:56.820 --> 2:29:58.420\n we're trying to behave selfishly.\n\n2:29:58.420 --> 2:30:00.060\n This is the domain of sin.\n\n2:30:01.260 --> 2:30:03.700\n I don't know all the sins, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath,\n\n2:30:03.700 --> 2:30:07.660\n lust, pride, envy, these are all selfish behaviors.\n\n2:30:07.660 --> 2:30:09.420\n Whereas something like love,\n\n2:30:09.420 --> 2:30:14.420\n it's morally superior in that it's more selfless.\n\n2:30:14.420 --> 2:30:15.740\n I don't know that we can properly\n\n2:30:15.740 --> 2:30:17.020\n define love with words at all,\n\n2:30:17.020 --> 2:30:19.660\n but I would say maybe like selfless action\n\n2:30:19.660 --> 2:30:22.620\n could be kind of a generalization of it.\n\n2:30:22.620 --> 2:30:25.620\n And that way, it is really hard to your point.\n\n2:30:25.620 --> 2:30:30.620\n It's hard to love in a world that has a lot of conflict\n\n2:30:32.460 --> 2:30:34.500\n that might make you fearful\n\n2:30:34.500 --> 2:30:36.060\n if you're really focused on your meat suit.\n\n2:30:36.060 --> 2:30:37.780\n But if you're focused on the bigger picture\n\n2:30:37.780 --> 2:30:40.900\n and you're focused on others and legacy and life,\n\n2:30:40.900 --> 2:30:43.020\n that there is a way to do it.\n\n2:30:43.020 --> 2:30:44.820\n And that's why I actually think Christ,\n\n2:30:44.820 --> 2:30:46.580\n that is the highest moral aim, right?\n\n2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:50.020\n He met all of the vitriol in life,\n\n2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:52.540\n betrayal, hate, violence,\n\n2:30:52.540 --> 2:30:55.700\n he met it all with love and he met it with compassion.\n\n2:30:55.700 --> 2:30:58.220\n And that's why, regardless of if you believe\n\n2:30:58.220 --> 2:31:00.820\n that he actually lived or any of this,\n\n2:31:00.820 --> 2:31:05.820\n he is symbolic of the highest moral consciousness possible.\n\n2:31:05.820 --> 2:31:09.540\n And Carl Jung would say that that was a suitable\n\n2:31:09.540 --> 2:31:12.340\n alternative to psychoanalysis,\n\n2:31:12.340 --> 2:31:14.740\n was actually setting your moral aim higher\n\n2:31:14.740 --> 2:31:16.940\n and striving towards it diligently.\n\n2:31:16.940 --> 2:31:20.180\n So, I mean, I agree completely.\n\n2:31:20.180 --> 2:31:22.740\n We need more of that in the Bitcoin space.\n\n2:31:22.740 --> 2:31:24.140\n We need more of that in the world, frankly.\n\n2:31:24.140 --> 2:31:24.980\n In the world, yeah.\n\n2:31:24.980 --> 2:31:28.100\n And these things, they're all intertwined.\n\n2:31:28.100 --> 2:31:32.140\n We touched on the beginning, all of us get to decide,\n\n2:31:32.140 --> 2:31:34.740\n but the world does influence what we do.\n\n2:31:34.740 --> 2:31:37.980\n It does influence kind of if we adopt fear or love,\n\n2:31:39.860 --> 2:31:42.100\n but it takes, I don't know, it takes good systems\n\n2:31:42.100 --> 2:31:45.420\n and it takes, I guess, good leaders to set an example.\n\n2:31:45.420 --> 2:31:48.860\n Yeah, I do believe that there's like individual people\n\n2:31:48.860 --> 2:31:50.620\n can have a ripple effect.\n\n2:31:50.620 --> 2:31:53.500\n So that's what I try to do, sort of embody the,\n\n2:31:53.500 --> 2:31:55.060\n I'm just one ant.\n\n2:31:55.060 --> 2:31:58.260\n But one of the things I have faith in is,\n\n2:31:59.580 --> 2:32:02.380\n I'm trying to do that more.\n\n2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:04.620\n I know this is a podcast,\n\n2:32:04.620 --> 2:32:07.900\n but I'm trying to do less talking and more doing.\n\n2:32:10.820 --> 2:32:13.260\n I've been disappointed in myself, if I'm being honest,\n\n2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:14.980\n how much talking I've been doing,\n\n2:32:15.980 --> 2:32:20.140\n as opposed to, like in my own private life,\n\n2:32:20.140 --> 2:32:22.100\n I live the thing I talk about,\n\n2:32:22.100 --> 2:32:24.660\n but I also haven't created much.\n\n2:32:26.100 --> 2:32:30.660\n And I believe in the power of individuals that create stuff,\n\n2:32:30.660 --> 2:32:33.460\n like create an idea through those individuals\n\n2:32:33.460 --> 2:32:35.700\n that try to create something new, the world progresses.\n\n2:32:35.700 --> 2:32:37.100\n And hopefully there's more and more,\n\n2:32:37.100 --> 2:32:39.260\n more and more of those people.\n\n2:32:39.260 --> 2:32:41.580\n So you mentioned kind of people who,\n\n2:32:42.540 --> 2:32:45.020\n what the Bitcoin community might call scammers.\n\n2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:50.460\n I have a lot of passions in my life\n\n2:32:50.460 --> 2:32:52.700\n that I focus a lot of my attention to.\n\n2:32:54.340 --> 2:32:59.340\n Bitcoin doesn't happen to be yet one of them.\n\n2:32:59.340 --> 2:33:01.460\n Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, you know.\n\n2:33:01.460 --> 2:33:06.460\n I'm always looking for things to really fall in love with.\n\n2:33:08.460 --> 2:33:12.860\n So how is a person like me supposed to figure out,\n\n2:33:13.780 --> 2:33:16.300\n I also happen to have a platform a little bit,\n\n2:33:16.300 --> 2:33:21.300\n and how am I supposed to figure out who is interesting,\n\n2:33:21.460 --> 2:33:25.060\n what is an interesting set of ideas and what are not?\n\n2:33:25.060 --> 2:33:27.220\n Because people are financially tied into\n\n2:33:27.220 --> 2:33:29.900\n a lot of the cryptocurrencies that we're talking about,\n\n2:33:29.900 --> 2:33:33.740\n certainly with Bitcoin, you know, their livelihood,\n\n2:33:33.740 --> 2:33:35.340\n their wellbeing is tied up to it.\n\n2:33:35.340 --> 2:33:37.940\n So it becomes much more emotional, much more personal.\n\n2:33:37.940 --> 2:33:41.500\n It's no longer purely an exploration of ideas.\n\n2:33:41.500 --> 2:33:44.060\n It's really almost like a threat on your property.\n\n2:33:44.060 --> 2:33:45.900\n Like it's a personal threat\n\n2:33:45.900 --> 2:33:47.940\n and it makes it very difficult to explore those ideas.\n\n2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:50.420\n So I understand that, but it makes it very difficult\n\n2:33:50.420 --> 2:33:55.420\n for somebody like me to just walk in and be curious.\n\n2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:59.540\n So how do I proceed in this difficult world\n\n2:33:59.540 --> 2:34:01.020\n in exploring this landscape\n\n2:34:02.100 --> 2:34:07.100\n and not give a platform to ideas that may harm others?\n\n2:34:10.700 --> 2:34:14.700\n I guess first I'd like to commend your forthrightness\n\n2:34:14.700 --> 2:34:17.180\n about this, because I don't think many people\n\n2:34:17.180 --> 2:34:18.980\n try to walk that line necessarily.\n\n2:34:18.980 --> 2:34:22.540\n People, again, kind of the territorial imperative,\n\n2:34:22.540 --> 2:34:25.780\n they'll put whoever on, they'll help expand their reach.\n\n2:34:25.780 --> 2:34:27.540\n Oh yeah, that's true.\n\n2:34:27.540 --> 2:34:29.540\n Or say whatever needs to be said to expand their reach.\n\n2:34:29.540 --> 2:34:31.340\n So I think you're coming from a good place.\n\n2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:32.180\n I'll say that.\n\n2:34:33.780 --> 2:34:36.020\n There's a great piece written\n\n2:34:36.020 --> 2:34:38.540\n on the topic of scammers and scamming.\n\n2:34:38.540 --> 2:34:40.140\n I think it was by Goldstein.\n\n2:34:40.140 --> 2:34:42.460\n He wrote a piece called, Everyone's a Scammer.\n\n2:34:42.460 --> 2:34:46.140\n And it's sort of back to this general human proclivity\n\n2:34:46.140 --> 2:34:48.540\n to try and get something for nothing always,\n\n2:34:48.540 --> 2:34:50.900\n which again, it can be positive,\n\n2:34:50.900 --> 2:34:52.980\n it can be innovative, or it can be a negative.\n\n2:34:52.980 --> 2:34:54.900\n You can be trying to steal from people.\n\n2:34:57.900 --> 2:34:59.940\n That might be, I think that's a useful piece\n\n2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:03.300\n just to kind of see the crypto world through that lens.\n\n2:35:03.300 --> 2:35:06.140\n And that's how Bitcoiners are thinking all the time.\n\n2:35:06.140 --> 2:35:08.980\n They are by nature adversarial thinkers.\n\n2:35:08.980 --> 2:35:11.860\n So they're trying to minimize the need for trust\n\n2:35:11.860 --> 2:35:14.700\n in any situation and maximize verification.\n\n2:35:14.700 --> 2:35:18.860\n As far as sifting through the ideas,\n\n2:35:18.860 --> 2:35:23.860\n I guess this is back where the cultural immune system\n\n2:35:23.860 --> 2:35:25.900\n has some utility.\n\n2:35:25.900 --> 2:35:28.100\n Because there were times when I thought\n\n2:35:28.100 --> 2:35:30.700\n this particular crypto asset,\n\n2:35:30.700 --> 2:35:32.700\n Augur was one I was really into,\n\n2:35:32.700 --> 2:35:34.900\n that it could facilitate prediction markets\n\n2:35:34.900 --> 2:35:38.020\n and prediction markets could make markets more efficient,\n\n2:35:38.020 --> 2:35:39.140\n et cetera, et cetera.\n\n2:35:39.140 --> 2:35:43.460\n But when that investment does get to the point\n\n2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:45.940\n when that investment thesis basically met\n\n2:35:45.940 --> 2:35:49.540\n the cultural filter or immune system,\n\n2:35:49.540 --> 2:35:51.740\n it forced me to reevaluate my position,\n\n2:35:51.740 --> 2:35:54.220\n forced me to really look into it more deeply.\n\n2:35:54.220 --> 2:35:55.900\n And through that exploration,\n\n2:35:55.900 --> 2:35:58.460\n I realized that it would need to be built on Bitcoin\n\n2:35:58.460 --> 2:35:59.940\n to work basically.\n\n2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:03.540\n So it really comes down to like you doing your homework,\n\n2:36:03.540 --> 2:36:08.100\n but we can't all deeply evaluate every idea out there.\n\n2:36:08.100 --> 2:36:11.460\n One of the things I struggle with was Alex Jones,\n\n2:36:11.460 --> 2:36:13.740\n for example, had dinner with him.\n\n2:36:16.420 --> 2:36:19.060\n I could tell that will be a very fun conversation,\n\n2:36:19.060 --> 2:36:22.860\n but like then I also understand that there's\n\n2:36:24.140 --> 2:36:27.820\n like consequences to that conversation\n\n2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:30.700\n that should be explored with care.\n\n2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:34.060\n And so you need to take on the responsibility\n\n2:36:34.060 --> 2:36:35.780\n of being a chef with the puffer fish\n\n2:36:35.780 --> 2:36:37.540\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:39.540\n That said, just like you said,\n\n2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:42.060\n it's very difficult to know this ahead of time\n\n2:36:43.300 --> 2:36:46.620\n and I will probably make mistakes.\n\n2:36:46.620 --> 2:36:49.860\n And that's a shitty thing to have to live with\n\n2:36:49.860 --> 2:36:51.260\n that I'm going to make mistakes\n\n2:36:51.260 --> 2:36:52.900\n and some of them very large.\n\n2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:57.540\n Like, yeah, I mean, I can imagine a bunch of different ways,\n\n2:36:57.540 --> 2:36:59.060\n but all we can do in this world\n\n2:36:59.060 --> 2:37:00.860\n is once we make the mistakes,\n\n2:37:00.860 --> 2:37:04.980\n we acknowledge those mistakes and learn.\n\n2:37:04.980 --> 2:37:09.740\n And also, I have to put this on the rest of us\n\n2:37:09.740 --> 2:37:14.740\n that you don't take one thing that a person did\n\n2:37:15.260 --> 2:37:17.860\n and then burn them at the stake for it.\n\n2:37:17.860 --> 2:37:20.620\n That you realize that we all make mistakes,\n\n2:37:20.620 --> 2:37:23.220\n that a particular mistake does not make the person.\n\n2:37:23.220 --> 2:37:27.660\n And this applies to taking stuff out of context\n\n2:37:27.660 --> 2:37:30.660\n over hundreds of hours of talking,\n\n2:37:30.660 --> 2:37:35.660\n but it applies to actual, in context, big mistake.\n\n2:37:37.380 --> 2:37:39.260\n So what if I murdered somebody at some point?\n\n2:37:39.260 --> 2:37:40.100\n Just give me a break.\n\n2:37:40.100 --> 2:37:42.340\n No, there are some things that are too far, of course,\n\n2:37:42.340 --> 2:37:47.140\n but in general, we need to give each other a chance.\n\n2:37:47.140 --> 2:37:48.560\n Yeah, but I'm still,\n\n2:37:50.460 --> 2:37:51.980\n I walk with a heavy heart\n\n2:37:51.980 --> 2:37:54.180\n knowing that I'll probably make a mistake,\n\n2:37:54.180 --> 2:37:56.540\n especially one that I didn't mean to.\n\n2:37:56.540 --> 2:37:58.340\n That's the one that worries me most.\n\n2:37:58.340 --> 2:38:03.340\n This is human nature, like hamartia, to miss the mark.\n\n2:38:03.940 --> 2:38:05.500\n That's the root word of sin.\n\n2:38:05.500 --> 2:38:07.300\n We are sinful by nature.\n\n2:38:07.300 --> 2:38:08.300\n We can't help it.\n\n2:38:08.300 --> 2:38:11.020\n There's no way, again, pain is information, right?\n\n2:38:11.020 --> 2:38:14.540\n There's no way to learn other than trying, failing,\n\n2:38:15.460 --> 2:38:19.620\n learning, and then you put yourself in better formation,\n\n2:38:19.620 --> 2:38:22.900\n right, in formation to better deal with it next time.\n\n2:38:22.900 --> 2:38:26.340\n So I hope, I don't get the sense\n\n2:38:26.340 --> 2:38:30.580\n that you're actually afraid of making a misstep.\n\n2:38:30.580 --> 2:38:35.580\n I think you're just maybe disappointed's a better word.\n\n2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:36.900\n You know you're gonna make the mistakes.\n\n2:38:36.900 --> 2:38:39.380\n Yeah, that's exactly, that's a much, much better word.\n\n2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:41.100\n But we have to embrace that.\n\n2:38:41.100 --> 2:38:42.260\n That's the only way anything,\n\n2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:43.880\n that's the only way we can advance,\n\n2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:46.660\n is that we're dealing with an incomprehensible reality.\n\n2:38:46.660 --> 2:38:48.460\n All we can do is throw spaghetti at the wall\n\n2:38:48.460 --> 2:38:50.180\n and see what sticks.\n\n2:38:50.180 --> 2:38:53.020\n And in that process, we're all inherently gonna hurt\n\n2:38:53.020 --> 2:38:54.100\n ourselves and hurt others,\n\n2:38:54.100 --> 2:38:57.740\n and that's where love and forgiveness come into play, right?\n\n2:38:57.740 --> 2:39:02.540\n And yeah, I think the other thing is that this culture\n\n2:39:02.540 --> 2:39:05.380\n of reducing people down to a label, right,\n\n2:39:05.380 --> 2:39:07.780\n whether it's racism or whether you're calling them a scammer\n\n2:39:07.780 --> 2:39:11.060\n or any number of terms,\n\n2:39:11.060 --> 2:39:14.780\n you're discounting their sovereignty to zero, right?\n\n2:39:14.780 --> 2:39:18.980\n You're taking a super complex human that is vast,\n\n2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:21.880\n contains multitudes, is changing over time,\n\n2:39:21.880 --> 2:39:24.460\n and you're trying to put them in a bucket of a word.\n\n2:39:25.620 --> 2:39:28.700\n And that is just, I think, a cognitive fallacy.\n\n2:39:28.700 --> 2:39:30.540\n Like, it's not only gonna hurt the person\n\n2:39:30.540 --> 2:39:32.980\n that you're winnowing down to a word,\n\n2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:34.420\n it's also gonna hurt you.\n\n2:39:34.420 --> 2:39:38.860\n And it's gonna, in your attempt to decomplexify reality\n\n2:39:38.860 --> 2:39:40.260\n by assigning this person to a term,\n\n2:39:40.260 --> 2:39:42.880\n you're actually gonna create bad outcomes for yourself.\n\n2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:45.200\n Because you're not gonna understand that person.\n\n2:39:45.200 --> 2:39:46.900\n I do also think there's a failure\n\n2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:50.640\n of our social media technology that incentivizes\n\n2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:53.140\n that kind of reduction to a label.\n\n2:39:53.140 --> 2:39:56.820\n It's just the viral nature of that reduction.\n\n2:39:56.820 --> 2:39:59.400\n So not only do we humans naturally do that,\n\n2:40:01.140 --> 2:40:06.080\n our social media platforms make that easier, more fun,\n\n2:40:07.260 --> 2:40:11.340\n more effective to do that at scale, the mass hysteria.\n\n2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:15.580\n So I think there's actually technological ways\n\n2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:18.180\n of adding friction to that.\n\n2:40:18.180 --> 2:40:21.220\n Yeah, I wonder, I mean, I agree with you that it's,\n\n2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:24.920\n social media is an amplifier to our natural,\n\n2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:27.180\n this natural way of dealing with one another.\n\n2:40:27.180 --> 2:40:30.500\n But I wonder, and my thinking has evolved a lot on this,\n\n2:40:30.500 --> 2:40:32.380\n that there's something below\n\n2:40:32.380 --> 2:40:35.100\n the way we're treating each other too, right?\n\n2:40:35.100 --> 2:40:37.800\n We could say civilization sort of advances\n\n2:40:37.800 --> 2:40:40.100\n in the tools we make and the way we treat each other.\n\n2:40:40.100 --> 2:40:42.780\n We tend to have better tools, better quality of life,\n\n2:40:42.780 --> 2:40:46.260\n and better morality, better quality of living,\n\n2:40:46.260 --> 2:40:49.180\n and ways of dealing with one another.\n\n2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:53.540\n And I think that when you corrupt the money,\n\n2:40:53.540 --> 2:40:56.580\n that it really does push us the negative direction,\n\n2:40:56.580 --> 2:41:01.580\n pushes us away from, again, encouraging,\n\n2:41:02.300 --> 2:41:05.580\n or magnifying scarcity artificially\n\n2:41:05.580 --> 2:41:07.480\n causes us to be more divisive.\n\n2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:08.660\n When things are more divisive,\n\n2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:11.620\n we tend to be less civilized, less nuanced,\n\n2:41:11.620 --> 2:41:14.480\n more black or white, or this or that,\n\n2:41:14.480 --> 2:41:17.980\n or you're this, or you're label A or label B.\n\n2:41:17.980 --> 2:41:20.620\n So I really think, and this is a harder one to unravel,\n\n2:41:20.620 --> 2:41:24.020\n but I think if we can fix the money, right,\n\n2:41:24.020 --> 2:41:26.900\n which again is the base layer operating system\n\n2:41:26.900 --> 2:41:29.240\n for human moral action in the world,\n\n2:41:30.220 --> 2:41:32.580\n that it has downstream effects.\n\n2:41:32.580 --> 2:41:34.440\n So we'd actually maybe start to treat each other\n\n2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:36.320\n a little better on social media,\n\n2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:41.180\n despite the fact that it enables this faster communication.\n\n2:41:41.180 --> 2:41:44.540\n That's interesting, so perhaps fixing social media\n\n2:41:44.540 --> 2:41:48.500\n as I've been thinking about is treating the symptom,\n\n2:41:48.500 --> 2:41:49.620\n not the cause.\n\n2:41:49.620 --> 2:41:52.840\n Yeah, that is the Bitcoin rabbit hole in a nutshell,\n\n2:41:52.840 --> 2:41:54.980\n is that they say fix the money, fix the world.\n\n2:41:54.980 --> 2:41:58.780\n You keep tracing these different social malaises\n\n2:41:58.780 --> 2:42:03.780\n or technological difficulties, lack of innovation.\n\n2:42:03.820 --> 2:42:06.140\n Weinstein's entire Portal podcast,\n\n2:42:06.140 --> 2:42:08.540\n something went wrong in the early 70s.\n\n2:42:08.540 --> 2:42:11.220\n We went off the gold standard in 1971,\n\n2:42:11.220 --> 2:42:15.980\n and there's a great website, wtfhappat1971.com,\n\n2:42:15.980 --> 2:42:18.400\n goes through this whole gamut of socioeconomic data\n\n2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:22.860\n that's completely gone askew since the early 70s.\n\n2:42:22.860 --> 2:42:24.540\n Yeah, you had this whole video,\n\n2:42:24.540 --> 2:42:28.500\n what do you think about Eric Weinstein and Bitcoin\n\n2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:31.620\n and the gold standard?\n\n2:42:31.620 --> 2:42:35.600\n Does he, I actually haven't heard him talk about his thesis\n\n2:42:35.600 --> 2:42:39.620\n about the 70s in connection to the,\n\n2:42:39.620 --> 2:42:42.060\n going off of the gold standard.\n\n2:42:42.060 --> 2:42:43.540\n Yeah, what are your thoughts there?\n\n2:42:43.540 --> 2:42:46.060\n What are your thoughts about his general relationship\n\n2:42:46.060 --> 2:42:49.740\n with the Bitcoin idea and the community?\n\n2:42:49.740 --> 2:42:52.940\n Yeah, the first exposure I had to Eric was his,\n\n2:42:52.940 --> 2:42:55.420\n I think it was his first episode with Peter Thiel,\n\n2:42:55.420 --> 2:42:57.100\n and they're going through that thesis\n\n2:42:57.100 --> 2:43:00.980\n that there's been this general institutional rot\n\n2:43:00.980 --> 2:43:03.900\n and suppression of innovation since the early 70s,\n\n2:43:03.900 --> 2:43:05.980\n and he's trying to identify what it is.\n\n2:43:05.980 --> 2:43:08.100\n I don't think they ever pended on the money\n\n2:43:09.300 --> 2:43:11.260\n on going off the gold standard,\n\n2:43:11.260 --> 2:43:14.580\n but in recent interactions with Eric,\n\n2:43:14.580 --> 2:43:16.640\n I've interacted with him on Clubhouse.\n\n2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:19.920\n We recently released an episode of the show\n\n2:43:19.920 --> 2:43:22.060\n I did with Chris Espley,\n\n2:43:22.060 --> 2:43:24.260\n and it was titled Dear Eric Weinstein.\n\n2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:26.760\n So we're going through his worldview\n\n2:43:26.760 --> 2:43:27.980\n that he's expressed in the portal\n\n2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:31.780\n and tying it back to the money in different ways.\n\n2:43:31.780 --> 2:43:33.300\n And he's been, he's engaged.\n\n2:43:33.300 --> 2:43:35.180\n Eric retweeted the show.\n\n2:43:35.180 --> 2:43:36.720\n We've exchanged some messages.\n\n2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:38.340\n He's been very open minded.\n\n2:43:38.340 --> 2:43:40.420\n He's asked some really good questions.\n\n2:43:40.420 --> 2:43:42.060\n So I get the sense that he's approaching\n\n2:43:42.060 --> 2:43:45.940\n this very wholeheartedly.\n\n2:43:45.940 --> 2:43:48.900\n He does bring with him his existing worldview\n\n2:43:48.900 --> 2:43:50.260\n and his existing theory.\n\n2:43:50.260 --> 2:43:52.140\n The one that really blew up was gauge theory.\n\n2:43:52.140 --> 2:43:53.300\n They got really popular.\n\n2:43:53.300 --> 2:43:54.820\n I don't know a lot about gauge theory.\n\n2:43:54.820 --> 2:43:56.680\n I actually messaged Eric and said,\n\n2:43:56.680 --> 2:43:58.100\n I want to learn more genuinely,\n\n2:43:58.100 --> 2:44:01.280\n because he seems to be serious\n\n2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:03.980\n that that needs to be considered in the sphere of money.\n\n2:44:03.980 --> 2:44:05.780\n And so I want to learn more about it.\n\n2:44:06.780 --> 2:44:08.220\n But I think overall it's great.\n\n2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:10.860\n It's great to see an intellectual heavyweight\n\n2:44:10.860 --> 2:44:13.700\n of his caliber gravitating towards Bitcoin.\n\n2:44:14.700 --> 2:44:18.980\n Yeah, he has some gauge theoretic conceptions\n\n2:44:18.980 --> 2:44:23.900\n about the world broadly, but also about economics,\n\n2:44:23.900 --> 2:44:27.140\n which ultimately boils down to just a set of mathematics,\n\n2:44:27.140 --> 2:44:30.740\n which allows you to more effectively reason about the world.\n\n2:44:30.740 --> 2:44:32.740\n And he has a certain set of views there.\n\n2:44:33.700 --> 2:44:37.140\n So it's fascinating to see him grapple with it.\n\n2:44:37.140 --> 2:44:42.140\n I think he's also kind of actually kind of like all of us,\n\n2:44:42.360 --> 2:44:45.800\n grappling with the idea of what is Bitcoin in this world.\n\n2:44:45.800 --> 2:44:47.700\n It's a very young technology,\n\n2:44:47.700 --> 2:44:52.700\n and it's unclear exactly how the ideas of the past\n\n2:44:52.860 --> 2:44:57.480\n fit with it and integrate, how the two integrate together.\n\n2:44:57.480 --> 2:44:59.900\n And so it's interesting to explore,\n\n2:44:59.900 --> 2:45:01.460\n not just Bitcoin in the particular.\n\n2:45:01.460 --> 2:45:06.460\n So for me, like what I've always saw Bitcoin as\n\n2:45:06.820 --> 2:45:11.060\n from the beginning, from a narrow worldview\n\n2:45:11.060 --> 2:45:14.500\n is computer science, which is where I come from.\n\n2:45:14.500 --> 2:45:16.740\n And so I wasn't almost aware\n\n2:45:16.740 --> 2:45:21.660\n in the social, political, financial aspects of Bitcoin.\n\n2:45:21.660 --> 2:45:26.440\n But now I see that there's not just power,\n\n2:45:26.440 --> 2:45:29.900\n but there's fascinating ideas to explore on that side\n\n2:45:29.900 --> 2:45:31.500\n of things, not just the computer science,\n\n2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:33.820\n not just the technical details,\n\n2:45:33.820 --> 2:45:38.820\n but the political, the socioeconomic, the philosophical.\n\n2:45:39.580 --> 2:45:43.000\n That's where I find all the fascination in the world,\n\n2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:43.840\n frankly.\n\n2:45:45.180 --> 2:45:49.500\n One other thing about Weinstein and intellectuals\n\n2:45:49.500 --> 2:45:52.340\n more generally that are skeptical of Bitcoin,\n\n2:45:52.340 --> 2:45:54.340\n I would challenge them to read the book,\n\n2:45:54.340 --> 2:45:57.500\n Human Action, written by Mises.\n\n2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:00.280\n I think in 1949, he published the English version.\n\n2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:04.820\n It's essentially the Bible of Austrian economics.\n\n2:46:04.820 --> 2:46:09.620\n And I think Austrian economics is a noticeable gap\n\n2:46:09.620 --> 2:46:13.760\n in most modern intellectuals worldviews,\n\n2:46:13.760 --> 2:46:15.240\n that it's not taught in school.\n\n2:46:15.240 --> 2:46:17.540\n I mean, I have a master's degree in accounting and finance,\n\n2:46:17.540 --> 2:46:19.260\n studied a lot of economics in school.\n\n2:46:19.260 --> 2:46:21.340\n There's not one peep of Austrian econ.\n\n2:46:21.340 --> 2:46:26.340\n The least we'd love talking about all the degrees he has.\n\n2:46:26.500 --> 2:46:27.860\n I was a CPA.\n\n2:46:27.860 --> 2:46:32.860\n But that curriculum that we get in college\n\n2:46:35.540 --> 2:46:38.660\n is noticeably deficient in Austrian economics.\n\n2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.100\n And I think there's a reason why, right?\n\n2:46:40.100 --> 2:46:43.280\n It's heavily government influenced.\n\n2:46:45.220 --> 2:46:46.640\n Again, master's degree in accounting,\n\n2:46:46.640 --> 2:46:48.680\n they never taught me about what money is\n\n2:46:48.680 --> 2:46:49.980\n or where money comes from.\n\n2:46:49.980 --> 2:46:53.820\n All you learn is that the central bank issues money\n\n2:46:53.820 --> 2:46:55.980\n and the central bank takes money away.\n\n2:46:55.980 --> 2:46:58.780\n So it's conceived of in the textbooks\n\n2:46:58.780 --> 2:47:00.580\n quite literally as God, right?\n\n2:47:00.580 --> 2:47:03.720\n An entity that suffers no opportunity costs,\n\n2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:06.780\n that basically is the foundation\n\n2:47:06.780 --> 2:47:09.100\n of the entire Keynesian worldview\n\n2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:10.900\n that you're taught in economics.\n\n2:47:10.900 --> 2:47:14.740\n And Austrian economics is the opposite\n\n2:47:14.740 --> 2:47:16.060\n end of the spectrum of that, right?\n\n2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:18.420\n It's actually the culmination,\n\n2:47:18.420 --> 2:47:20.740\n which economics is the youngest science in the world,\n\n2:47:20.740 --> 2:47:21.580\n by the way.\n\n2:47:21.580 --> 2:47:24.960\n So it is kind of the front,\n\n2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:27.000\n it's the frontiers of science in many ways,\n\n2:47:27.000 --> 2:47:29.500\n like to actually, when I say praxeology,\n\n2:47:29.500 --> 2:47:31.300\n many people have never even heard of that.\n\n2:47:31.300 --> 2:47:35.860\n But it's something, it's an a priori study\n\n2:47:35.860 --> 2:47:37.360\n equivalent to something like mathematics,\n\n2:47:37.360 --> 2:47:39.560\n that you're building things from first principles\n\n2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:42.400\n to reason about economic reality.\n\n2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:46.380\n And I think that book, it's a very difficult book\n\n2:47:46.380 --> 2:47:49.780\n written by Mises, 1200 pages, translated from German.\n\n2:47:49.780 --> 2:47:52.180\n The way he wields English is fascinating\n\n2:47:52.180 --> 2:47:53.980\n and terrifying all at the same time.\n\n2:47:54.900 --> 2:47:56.540\n It'd probably take you six months to read it\n\n2:47:56.540 --> 2:47:58.100\n if you read it daily, seriously.\n\n2:47:58.100 --> 2:48:00.460\n Like it's a beast of a book.\n\n2:48:00.460 --> 2:48:04.380\n But that will plug the gap, I think in most,\n\n2:48:04.380 --> 2:48:06.140\n any intellectual that's skeptical about Bitcoin,\n\n2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:08.000\n I think that will plug the gap that's necessary\n\n2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:10.340\n for you to see it in a new light.\n\n2:48:10.340 --> 2:48:12.620\n Well, I'll take that as a challenge.\n\n2:48:12.620 --> 2:48:14.460\n Now that we took a little bit of a break,\n\n2:48:14.460 --> 2:48:16.480\n ate some good Texas brisket, thank you for that,\n\n2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:17.700\n by the way, for passing over.\n\n2:48:17.700 --> 2:48:18.900\n Quite welcome.\n\n2:48:18.900 --> 2:48:21.560\n Let me ask the ridiculous question.\n\n2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:24.180\n At the core of the idea of Bitcoin,\n\n2:48:24.180 --> 2:48:28.360\n is this guy or this entity named Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n2:48:28.360 --> 2:48:32.220\n So the ridiculous question is, who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:33.780\n And first of all, is it you?\n\n2:48:35.120 --> 2:48:35.960\n It's not me.\n\n2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:38.260\n I wish.\n\n2:48:38.260 --> 2:48:41.780\n And is this an interesting question?\n\n2:48:41.780 --> 2:48:43.460\n Or is it just something about our human nature\n\n2:48:43.460 --> 2:48:47.140\n that wants to, that always tends towards mystery?\n\n2:48:47.140 --> 2:48:50.620\n Well, as we've touched on a bit today,\n\n2:48:51.620 --> 2:48:53.820\n you know, mythology, in my opinion,\n\n2:48:53.820 --> 2:48:57.380\n is something that is intrinsic to how we see the world\n\n2:48:57.380 --> 2:48:58.220\n in a lot of ways.\n\n2:48:58.220 --> 2:49:00.780\n Like it's how, it's kind of the structure\n\n2:49:02.240 --> 2:49:04.440\n by which we build these useful fictions.\n\n2:49:05.460 --> 2:49:08.260\n And so in that way, you could just say that\n\n2:49:08.260 --> 2:49:11.840\n Satoshi is the godhead of Bitcoin, effectively.\n\n2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:15.560\n And I think a compelling argument could be made\n\n2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:18.020\n that his disappearance is what really solidifies\n\n2:49:18.020 --> 2:49:20.140\n Bitcoin's decentralization.\n\n2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:25.140\n Because if there were one individual to personally vilify\n\n2:49:25.460 --> 2:49:30.380\n or denigrate or attack, you know, to disparage\n\n2:49:30.380 --> 2:49:33.560\n or question the motives of, you know,\n\n2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:37.780\n if he's out on the Hollywood Hills partying,\n\n2:49:37.780 --> 2:49:40.500\n everyone knows he's got a million Bitcoin, you know,\n\n2:49:40.500 --> 2:49:43.500\n it would just kind of tarnish the entire project\n\n2:49:43.500 --> 2:49:44.340\n in a lot of ways.\n\n2:49:44.340 --> 2:49:48.100\n But the fact that on that theme, something for nothing,\n\n2:49:48.100 --> 2:49:51.140\n this guy actually gave humanity something for nothing.\n\n2:49:51.140 --> 2:49:56.140\n And it appears that he didn't profit in any way.\n\n2:49:56.780 --> 2:49:58.220\n He, she, or they.\n\n2:49:59.420 --> 2:50:01.820\n I actually heard recently that he identified as a he\n\n2:50:01.820 --> 2:50:03.100\n in some of his communications.\n\n2:50:03.100 --> 2:50:04.700\n So it sounds like it is a he.\n\n2:50:04.700 --> 2:50:09.700\n So like his communication is being like studied,\n\n2:50:11.060 --> 2:50:14.460\n like almost like exactly as if he is a religious.\n\n2:50:14.460 --> 2:50:15.580\n That's right.\n\n2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:16.620\n Like a prophet.\n\n2:50:18.420 --> 2:50:23.420\n It's fascinating to imagine that he's still alive\n\n2:50:24.420 --> 2:50:27.260\n and living in this world.\n\n2:50:27.260 --> 2:50:29.140\n And it's even more fascinating to imagine\n\n2:50:29.140 --> 2:50:32.220\n that he's perhaps participating in the Bitcoin community\n\n2:50:32.220 --> 2:50:36.780\n because I mean, that takes a special human being\n\n2:50:36.780 --> 2:50:41.420\n to out of principle do that, to do, to remain anonymous.\n\n2:50:41.420 --> 2:50:43.460\n That's very much the George Washington.\n\n2:50:43.460 --> 2:50:46.480\n Yeah, I always wonder like how many people are like that?\n\n2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:48.900\n There's a cliche that like absolute power corrupts,\n\n2:50:48.900 --> 2:50:51.380\n absolutely, like power corrupts.\n\n2:50:51.380 --> 2:50:55.000\n But it seems like the progress of humanity depends\n\n2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:57.900\n on the people whom power doesn't corrupt.\n\n2:50:57.900 --> 2:51:02.760\n And it's enough to have just a small selection of those.\n\n2:51:04.340 --> 2:51:09.340\n And even if most of us are too weak, we give into power.\n\n2:51:09.500 --> 2:51:14.020\n If given the chance, all it takes is a few.\n\n2:51:14.020 --> 2:51:15.540\n That's, I've never thought of it like that,\n\n2:51:15.540 --> 2:51:18.300\n but Marcus Aurelius immediately came to mind.\n\n2:51:18.300 --> 2:51:21.780\n You know, the guy that he had the keys to the kingdom\n\n2:51:21.780 --> 2:51:26.300\n and he apparently adhered to the stoic virtues\n\n2:51:26.300 --> 2:51:30.140\n until the end, but yeah, I agree with Satoshi.\n\n2:51:30.140 --> 2:51:35.140\n The other thing that's interesting is he would be by far\n\n2:51:35.500 --> 2:51:39.980\n the most wealthy person in the world on a liquid asset basis\n\n2:51:39.980 --> 2:51:42.220\n because he has a million Bitcoin,\n\n2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:47.220\n which is 60 billion liquid net worth at current prices.\n\n2:51:47.860 --> 2:51:51.620\n So if he is still alive and just operating in the world,\n\n2:51:51.620 --> 2:51:56.180\n he is daily and moment to moment resisting massive\n\n2:51:56.180 --> 2:52:01.180\n incentives to go and just be the richest guy in the world.\n\n2:52:01.180 --> 2:52:02.740\n He's the ultimate hodler.\n\n2:52:02.740 --> 2:52:03.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:03.580 --> 2:52:05.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:07.740\n I mean, so it's, I mean, it's turning down\n\n2:52:07.740 --> 2:52:12.300\n not just financial success, but also fame.\n\n2:52:12.300 --> 2:52:14.140\n I mean, fame is another drug.\n\n2:52:14.140 --> 2:52:17.340\n It's kind of power, but it's in itself is also a drug,\n\n2:52:17.340 --> 2:52:20.540\n especially in this modern society, in this attention.\n\n2:52:20.540 --> 2:52:21.660\n And he would have both.\n\n2:52:21.660 --> 2:52:22.900\n He would have both.\n\n2:52:22.900 --> 2:52:25.780\n It's fun to imagine who it could be.\n\n2:52:25.780 --> 2:52:27.900\n It's fascinating if it's somebody like you\n\n2:52:27.900 --> 2:52:30.580\n or somebody like Elon or somebody like that.\n\n2:52:30.580 --> 2:52:31.900\n That's fascinating to think about.\n\n2:52:31.900 --> 2:52:34.620\n I think Elon would be hilarious if he came out\n\n2:52:34.620 --> 2:52:36.860\n and he was Satoshi and be like,\n\n2:52:36.860 --> 2:52:38.900\n hey guys, I know I'm already the richest guy in the world,\n\n2:52:38.900 --> 2:52:41.460\n but I gotta go ahead and double my lead here.\n\n2:52:42.460 --> 2:52:46.420\n What do you make of Elon Musk investing with Tesla,\n\n2:52:46.420 --> 2:52:50.380\n investing in Bitcoin and maybe broaden it out\n\n2:52:50.380 --> 2:52:54.660\n in some of these other, you know,\n\n2:52:54.660 --> 2:52:57.980\n big billionaires, but also people tied to major companies\n\n2:52:57.980 --> 2:52:59.900\n investing in Bitcoin?\n\n2:52:59.900 --> 2:53:04.020\n Yeah, I think Michael Saylor really led the charge on that.\n\n2:53:04.900 --> 2:53:06.460\n He's the CEO of MicroStrategy\n\n2:53:06.460 --> 2:53:09.220\n that I think they've acquired upwards\n\n2:53:09.220 --> 2:53:11.020\n of $2 billion in Bitcoin now.\n\n2:53:11.020 --> 2:53:14.780\n Started acquiring August, maybe of 2020.\n\n2:53:15.940 --> 2:53:19.020\n And he's, you know, personally bought a lot of it.\n\n2:53:19.020 --> 2:53:22.500\n He bought a lot as a treasury reserve asset\n\n2:53:22.500 --> 2:53:24.140\n for his company, MicroStrategy.\n\n2:53:24.140 --> 2:53:27.460\n Then they leveraged up on a convertible note\n\n2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:28.300\n and bought more.\n\n2:53:28.300 --> 2:53:32.340\n So he's really gone, really leading the charge\n\n2:53:32.340 --> 2:53:35.940\n in this Bitcoin institutional adoption.\n\n2:53:35.940 --> 2:53:38.100\n Your conversation with him is a really interesting one.\n\n2:53:38.100 --> 2:53:41.780\n Your series of, I mean, series of episodes I suppose,\n\n2:53:41.780 --> 2:53:44.220\n but it's only a couple of conversations, I guess.\n\n2:53:44.220 --> 2:53:48.180\n Yeah, we recorded twice, five and a half hours each.\n\n2:53:48.180 --> 2:53:50.140\n So it's about 11 hours of content.\n\n2:53:50.140 --> 2:53:50.980\n Yeah, thank you.\n\n2:53:50.980 --> 2:53:55.140\n A lot of people have said that it's the best\n\n2:53:55.140 --> 2:53:57.300\n first principle thing they've ever seen on Bitcoin,\n\n2:53:57.300 --> 2:53:59.300\n which I take no credit for that at all.\n\n2:53:59.300 --> 2:54:02.540\n I mean, I just sat down with a guy and unleashed him.\n\n2:54:02.540 --> 2:54:04.020\n He's just a beast.\n\n2:54:04.020 --> 2:54:09.020\n Yeah, but it's fascinating that his longterm vision with it.\n\n2:54:11.300 --> 2:54:15.500\n I mean, I'm not sure I'm all philosophically bought in,\n\n2:54:15.500 --> 2:54:20.500\n but if he's right, if this set of ideas are as powerful\n\n2:54:20.500 --> 2:54:24.140\n as he describes, as you described,\n\n2:54:24.140 --> 2:54:26.700\n that this would change the world,\n\n2:54:26.700 --> 2:54:28.700\n which as you say, it's funny that a company\n\n2:54:28.700 --> 2:54:33.700\n like MicroStrategy might be the company\n\n2:54:34.540 --> 2:54:38.060\n that has the biggest macro effect\n\n2:54:38.060 --> 2:54:40.180\n on our economy and our world.\n\n2:54:40.180 --> 2:54:44.420\n Yeah, the conversation reshaped my worldview a lot too,\n\n2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:48.100\n because he framed money as energy,\n\n2:54:48.100 --> 2:54:50.940\n which I had often thought of money as time.\n\n2:54:50.940 --> 2:54:53.460\n And it explored those connections a lot in my writing,\n\n2:54:53.460 --> 2:54:57.300\n but looking at it as energy, and then his supposition\n\n2:54:57.300 --> 2:55:01.980\n that the purpose of life is to basically channel energy\n\n2:55:01.980 --> 2:55:03.140\n across space and time.\n\n2:55:03.140 --> 2:55:05.100\n So we're just trying to figure out how to channel\n\n2:55:05.100 --> 2:55:07.100\n more energy across space and time\n\n2:55:07.100 --> 2:55:08.860\n toward the satisfaction of aims.\n\n2:55:09.940 --> 2:55:12.660\n And his definition, or his answer to that question,\n\n2:55:12.660 --> 2:55:15.300\n what is money, is that money is the highest form of energy\n\n2:55:15.300 --> 2:55:17.140\n a human being can channel.\n\n2:55:17.140 --> 2:55:19.420\n So it's a claim to all other forms of energy\n\n2:55:19.420 --> 2:55:20.780\n we can manifest in the world.\n\n2:55:20.780 --> 2:55:24.900\n And that just completely reshaped how I see it,\n\n2:55:24.900 --> 2:55:26.300\n brought in this whole other side\n\n2:55:26.300 --> 2:55:30.820\n to my intellectual explorations of money.\n\n2:55:30.820 --> 2:55:32.180\n Can you elaborate on that a little bit?\n\n2:55:32.180 --> 2:55:34.300\n So I understand money is time,\n\n2:55:34.300 --> 2:55:37.100\n which in itself is a really powerful idea.\n\n2:55:37.100 --> 2:55:39.740\n But money is energy, and channeling energy,\n\n2:55:39.740 --> 2:55:40.700\n can you break that apart?\n\n2:55:40.700 --> 2:55:44.980\n Yeah, so I guess I definitely have to check out\n\n2:55:44.980 --> 2:55:46.980\n the whole series to really get his perspective,\n\n2:55:46.980 --> 2:55:49.420\n but I'll do my best to condense it.\n\n2:55:51.300 --> 2:55:54.980\n Life itself, all forms of life are,\n\n2:55:54.980 --> 2:55:56.500\n they're dependent on energy, right?\n\n2:55:56.500 --> 2:56:00.500\n Energy fuels everything, fuels life in action and motion\n\n2:56:00.500 --> 2:56:01.340\n and all of that.\n\n2:56:02.340 --> 2:56:04.820\n And we could say that maybe like a plant\n\n2:56:06.180 --> 2:56:08.980\n is harnessing solar energy\n\n2:56:08.980 --> 2:56:11.820\n and then reallocating that into growth.\n\n2:56:11.820 --> 2:56:15.220\n So its aim is to grow towards the sun, right?\n\n2:56:15.220 --> 2:56:17.620\n So it's allocating energy towards its goal\n\n2:56:17.620 --> 2:56:20.740\n of harnessing more solar energy kind of thing.\n\n2:56:20.740 --> 2:56:25.740\n So, and humans too have evolved\n\n2:56:27.220 --> 2:56:30.580\n to figure out how to harness energy in different ways\n\n2:56:30.580 --> 2:56:35.180\n to satisfy higher and more complicated aims.\n\n2:56:35.180 --> 2:56:37.540\n So the original energy network\n\n2:56:38.700 --> 2:56:41.220\n that he referenced was fire, right?\n\n2:56:41.220 --> 2:56:45.740\n We actually learned to wield fire as a tool in and of itself.\n\n2:56:45.740 --> 2:56:48.140\n So not only are we learning to channel energy,\n\n2:56:48.140 --> 2:56:51.380\n but we're actually learning how to isolate energy\n\n2:56:51.380 --> 2:56:53.820\n as a tool in and of itself.\n\n2:56:53.820 --> 2:56:55.020\n And so we went into that,\n\n2:56:55.020 --> 2:56:59.700\n how harnessing fire had changed human beings.\n\n2:56:59.700 --> 2:57:04.140\n And actually, this is one of the earliest examples too\n\n2:57:04.140 --> 2:57:07.660\n of a coevolution between tool and our biology,\n\n2:57:07.660 --> 2:57:11.580\n because when we developed fire, we developed cooking.\n\n2:57:11.580 --> 2:57:13.180\n And cooking is, you can kind of think of it\n\n2:57:13.180 --> 2:57:14.540\n as pre digestion in a way.\n\n2:57:14.540 --> 2:57:16.300\n We're liberating these macronutrients\n\n2:57:16.300 --> 2:57:18.420\n or making things that otherwise\n\n2:57:18.420 --> 2:57:21.020\n would not be digestible, edible.\n\n2:57:22.020 --> 2:57:23.340\n And it increases the efficiency\n\n2:57:23.340 --> 2:57:26.220\n by which we extract nutrients from food.\n\n2:57:26.220 --> 2:57:27.540\n That's what cooking does.\n\n2:57:27.540 --> 2:57:29.900\n So when we figured out cooking,\n\n2:57:29.900 --> 2:57:33.660\n we liberated all these digestive resources\n\n2:57:33.660 --> 2:57:36.660\n that were reallocated towards higher cognitive development.\n\n2:57:36.660 --> 2:57:39.620\n So there's this evolutionary path\n\n2:57:39.620 --> 2:57:42.820\n between figuring out fire and us becoming smarter,\n\n2:57:42.820 --> 2:57:44.060\n which is interesting.\n\n2:57:45.900 --> 2:57:47.740\n Some other early examples he gave,\n\n2:57:47.740 --> 2:57:50.340\n he went into were missiles and hydraulics.\n\n2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:56.660\n So missiles being, we learned to hunt at a distance.\n\n2:57:56.660 --> 2:57:58.900\n We can't bring down a wooly mammoth,\n\n2:57:58.900 --> 2:58:03.900\n maybe with spears and up close and personal force,\n\n2:58:03.900 --> 2:58:07.500\n but we could with spears and javelins and slings and whatnot.\n\n2:58:07.500 --> 2:58:11.500\n And then he went into how we've used water\n\n2:58:11.500 --> 2:58:12.900\n to channel hydraulic energy.\n\n2:58:12.900 --> 2:58:14.540\n So we can basically overcome gravity.\n\n2:58:14.540 --> 2:58:19.540\n We can move, there's theories that the pyramids\n\n2:58:19.940 --> 2:58:22.300\n were constructed using, the blocks were moved\n\n2:58:22.300 --> 2:58:25.220\n using hydraulic energy or using water.\n\n2:58:25.220 --> 2:58:27.660\n Clearly we use like cargo ships and whatnot\n\n2:58:27.660 --> 2:58:29.900\n to move things much more efficiently across water\n\n2:58:29.900 --> 2:58:32.140\n than we could the land.\n\n2:58:32.140 --> 2:58:37.140\n So his whole view is how we keep figuring out better ways\n\n2:58:37.300 --> 2:58:40.300\n and more efficient ways to harness energy and channel it.\n\n2:58:40.300 --> 2:58:45.300\n And in that perspective, money has always represented\n\n2:58:46.580 --> 2:58:48.740\n a claim on all other forms of energy.\n\n2:58:48.740 --> 2:58:51.660\n So whatever energy couldn't be channeled\n\n2:58:51.660 --> 2:58:54.580\n towards something useful in the economy historically\n\n2:58:54.580 --> 2:58:55.980\n would go into gold mining.\n\n2:58:55.980 --> 2:58:59.340\n So gold became this residual, this economic,\n\n2:58:59.340 --> 2:59:03.860\n this token of the excess energy created\n\n2:59:03.860 --> 2:59:05.300\n by the market economy.\n\n2:59:05.300 --> 2:59:07.220\n And then you could take that token of energy\n\n2:59:07.220 --> 2:59:10.420\n and use it to redeem for any other form of energy\n\n2:59:10.420 --> 2:59:13.340\n or any of the products of energy itself.\n\n2:59:13.340 --> 2:59:17.820\n So it's, I guess it's my best approximation of it.\n\n2:59:17.820 --> 2:59:22.060\n And it just really shattered my worldview again,\n\n2:59:22.060 --> 2:59:23.540\n because I'd always thought about it as time.\n\n2:59:23.540 --> 2:59:26.380\n Like we spend time sacrificing to obtain money\n\n2:59:26.380 --> 2:59:28.420\n that we then redeem for commencement sacrifices\n\n2:59:28.420 --> 2:59:32.420\n from others, but I'd never considered it purely as energy.\n\n2:59:32.420 --> 2:59:34.340\n And then it also ties back into gold,\n\n2:59:35.260 --> 2:59:38.940\n where there was an energy expenditure necessary\n\n2:59:38.940 --> 2:59:40.260\n to obtain gold.\n\n2:59:40.260 --> 2:59:43.700\n So there's a proof of work associated with obtaining gold\n\n2:59:43.700 --> 2:59:46.100\n that protected its market value, right?\n\n2:59:46.100 --> 2:59:47.780\n So you had to expend, again,\n\n2:59:47.780 --> 2:59:50.220\n if market value of gold's 2000 an ounce,\n\n2:59:50.220 --> 2:59:53.180\n you had to expend 1900 an ounce mining.\n\n2:59:53.180 --> 2:59:56.580\n So it kept producers honest in a way.\n\n2:59:56.580 --> 2:59:58.980\n So do you think something like proof of stake\n\n2:59:58.980 --> 3:00:01.940\n that's more about reputation\n\n3:00:01.940 --> 3:00:06.940\n than actual exertion, like energy can work?\n\n3:00:10.180 --> 3:00:13.660\n No, I think proof of stake is inherently centralizing.\n\n3:00:15.460 --> 3:00:18.380\n It's like the old Matthew principle,\n\n3:00:18.380 --> 3:00:20.900\n from those who have to those who have,\n\n3:00:20.900 --> 3:00:22.900\n more will be given from those who have not,\n\n3:00:22.900 --> 3:00:24.100\n everything will be taken.\n\n3:00:24.100 --> 3:00:26.420\n That's what proof of stake is.\n\n3:00:26.420 --> 3:00:29.860\n You need proof of work to embody skin in the game\n\n3:00:29.860 --> 3:00:33.580\n in the marketplace, such that contributions\n\n3:00:33.580 --> 3:00:36.420\n are commensurate with consideration received.\n\n3:00:36.420 --> 3:00:37.900\n That's how systems work.\n\n3:00:39.420 --> 3:00:42.820\n What's the idea why proof of work might\n\n3:00:44.900 --> 3:00:46.980\n incentivize decentralization?\n\n3:00:49.620 --> 3:00:53.220\n Do you worry that as Bitcoin becomes more powerful,\n\n3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:56.820\n it may become, again, more centralized?\n\n3:00:56.820 --> 3:00:59.580\n Well, the decentralization of Bitcoin\n\n3:01:00.980 --> 3:01:03.780\n is largely driven by the nodes, actually,\n\n3:01:03.780 --> 3:01:05.300\n which aren't actually mining.\n\n3:01:05.300 --> 3:01:07.780\n They're just choosing which rule set to implement.\n\n3:01:10.660 --> 3:01:12.140\n And then the mining network's\n\n3:01:12.140 --> 3:01:14.580\n actually enforcing that rule set.\n\n3:01:14.580 --> 3:01:17.660\n So I think the mining network\n\n3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:22.140\n is inherently decentralized in that,\n\n3:01:22.140 --> 3:01:24.540\n really anyone with access to cheap energy\n\n3:01:24.540 --> 3:01:25.580\n can become a miner.\n\n3:01:25.580 --> 3:01:27.860\n You can freely enter or exit the market\n\n3:01:27.860 --> 3:01:29.300\n or the network at any time.\n\n3:01:30.860 --> 3:01:34.780\n But maintaining the block size at a manageable level\n\n3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:38.020\n is what's key to maintaining node decentralization.\n\n3:01:38.020 --> 3:01:39.580\n This is an interesting question.\n\n3:01:40.540 --> 3:01:43.300\n Who do you think has more power, the miners or the nodes?\n\n3:01:44.340 --> 3:01:49.340\n Because the nodes carry the idea of the protocol,\n\n3:01:49.340 --> 3:01:52.340\n like the specifics.\n\n3:01:52.340 --> 3:01:55.140\n So in some sense, they have more power,\n\n3:01:55.140 --> 3:01:56.700\n if Bitcoin is an idea.\n\n3:01:58.340 --> 3:02:00.500\n They're kind of mutually indispensable though,\n\n3:02:00.500 --> 3:02:01.740\n because you can't have,\n\n3:02:03.580 --> 3:02:05.740\n there's no security without the miners.\n\n3:02:05.740 --> 3:02:08.260\n So without the miners, Bitcoin is just an idea.\n\n3:02:08.260 --> 3:02:11.980\n And the idea of Bitcoin has maybe existed\n\n3:02:11.980 --> 3:02:13.060\n even before Bitcoin, right?\n\n3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:13.900\n Just sound money.\n\n3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:15.660\n We just say sound money as an idea.\n\n3:02:15.660 --> 3:02:19.620\n But there was no way to root that into thermodynamic reality\n\n3:02:19.620 --> 3:02:24.060\n without Satoshi figuring out, not just proof of work,\n\n3:02:24.060 --> 3:02:27.340\n it's the entire composite of the difficulty adjustment,\n\n3:02:27.340 --> 3:02:31.700\n proof of work, one way hashing, et cetera.\n\n3:02:31.700 --> 3:02:34.020\n So I don't know, that's hard to say,\n\n3:02:34.020 --> 3:02:35.420\n hard to disentangle the two.\n\n3:02:36.340 --> 3:02:39.140\n You've talked about money as morality too.\n\n3:02:40.460 --> 3:02:43.540\n How do you think about moral and immoral action\n\n3:02:43.540 --> 3:02:45.780\n in the context of money?\n\n3:02:47.340 --> 3:02:51.020\n There's this great quote by Rothbard,\n\n3:02:51.020 --> 3:02:53.740\n who's a famous Austrian economist.\n\n3:02:53.740 --> 3:02:57.780\n And he says, quote, to be moral, an act must be free,\n\n3:02:58.900 --> 3:02:59.740\n unquote.\n\n3:03:00.860 --> 3:03:05.860\n And I think morality, it changes over time\n\n3:03:07.900 --> 3:03:12.220\n and it is, it has its roots\n\n3:03:12.220 --> 3:03:14.420\n in biology.\n\n3:03:15.700 --> 3:03:17.540\n Jordan Peterson makes the point that even animals\n\n3:03:17.540 --> 3:03:21.100\n have their own sort of pseudo morality.\n\n3:03:21.100 --> 3:03:24.420\n Where like with wolf packs, for instance,\n\n3:03:24.420 --> 3:03:26.900\n if there's a dispute between the alpha males,\n\n3:03:26.900 --> 3:03:30.780\n or I guess between an alpha male and a incumbent,\n\n3:03:30.780 --> 3:03:35.460\n the two males will have a fight basically.\n\n3:03:35.460 --> 3:03:39.420\n And then when one, it's decided that one has won,\n\n3:03:39.420 --> 3:03:42.020\n the loser will basically roll over and give up his neck\n\n3:03:42.020 --> 3:03:44.940\n to the alpha male.\n\n3:03:44.940 --> 3:03:47.780\n And they do this instead of fighting to the death\n\n3:03:47.780 --> 3:03:50.980\n because in a wolf pack, they need every wolf\n\n3:03:50.980 --> 3:03:52.780\n so they can go out and bring down,\n\n3:03:52.780 --> 3:03:54.900\n you never know when you're gonna need the 20th wolf\n\n3:03:54.900 --> 3:03:56.980\n to bring down the big buffalo the next day or whatever.\n\n3:03:56.980 --> 3:04:01.260\n So they've developed this less than fight to the death\n\n3:04:01.260 --> 3:04:04.540\n social morality to optimize their effectiveness\n\n3:04:04.540 --> 3:04:05.620\n as a wolf pack.\n\n3:04:07.860 --> 3:04:10.740\n And similarly for humans, like our morality\n\n3:04:10.740 --> 3:04:15.740\n sort of emerges through competition and play even.\n\n3:04:16.140 --> 3:04:19.860\n There are these implicit rules that come into place\n\n3:04:19.860 --> 3:04:22.780\n based on how we're organizing ourselves over time.\n\n3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:28.980\n And with, so with money it's interesting\n\n3:04:29.380 --> 3:04:33.500\n because most tools we would consider to be amoral,\n\n3:04:34.380 --> 3:04:38.060\n as in a hammer can be used to build a house\n\n3:04:38.060 --> 3:04:39.340\n which could be seen to be good,\n\n3:04:39.340 --> 3:04:40.780\n like a good constructive purpose,\n\n3:04:40.780 --> 3:04:43.060\n or it could be used to bash them on skull,\n\n3:04:43.060 --> 3:04:44.580\n which could be something evil.\n\n3:04:45.940 --> 3:04:49.380\n And that the tool itself is amoral,\n\n3:04:49.380 --> 3:04:51.500\n doesn't have any independent morality of its own.\n\n3:04:51.500 --> 3:04:54.020\n All of the morality is associated\n\n3:04:54.020 --> 3:04:55.380\n with the wielder of the tool.\n\n3:04:55.380 --> 3:04:58.620\n So what's the quote like, any tool can be a weapon\n\n3:04:58.620 --> 3:05:00.380\n if you hold it right sort of thing.\n\n3:05:01.460 --> 3:05:05.660\n But money's maybe a little bit different in that\n\n3:05:05.660 --> 3:05:10.660\n when you monopolize money,\n\n3:05:11.860 --> 3:05:15.260\n it's only useful as a tool for one thing.\n\n3:05:15.260 --> 3:05:17.820\n And that's for allocating wealth away from some\n\n3:05:17.820 --> 3:05:19.420\n and to others.\n\n3:05:19.420 --> 3:05:23.620\n So it is the only utility of monopolized money is theft.\n\n3:05:24.500 --> 3:05:28.220\n There's no other, there's a lot of propaganda out there\n\n3:05:28.220 --> 3:05:29.660\n that will say, oh, we need to print money\n\n3:05:29.660 --> 3:05:34.340\n to get out of this disaster or to give to the poor,\n\n3:05:34.340 --> 3:05:39.340\n whatever moralistically camouflaged political aim\n\n3:05:40.260 --> 3:05:44.260\n is being discussed, the base layer of monopolized money\n\n3:05:44.260 --> 3:05:46.300\n is that it's only useful for taking from some\n\n3:05:46.300 --> 3:05:47.780\n and giving to others.\n\n3:05:47.780 --> 3:05:51.500\n So another way to think about this is that money\n\n3:05:51.500 --> 3:05:55.100\n is a paper claim on the savings of society.\n\n3:05:55.100 --> 3:05:58.100\n So it is just a ticket for redeeming savings,\n\n3:05:58.100 --> 3:06:00.820\n which could be time, could be capital,\n\n3:06:00.820 --> 3:06:04.580\n it could be knowledge from any market actor in the world.\n\n3:06:04.580 --> 3:06:06.780\n So it's kind of a list of who owns what,\n\n3:06:06.780 --> 3:06:08.100\n if you will, it's a proxy list.\n\n3:06:08.100 --> 3:06:11.180\n If there's one group that can amend that list\n\n3:06:11.180 --> 3:06:14.700\n and others cannot, then they're basically able\n\n3:06:14.700 --> 3:06:18.900\n and incented to modify that list to their own benefit.\n\n3:06:20.380 --> 3:06:23.060\n And that's effectively what a central bank is doing.\n\n3:06:23.060 --> 3:06:27.100\n So a central bank is determining how much money to create.\n\n3:06:27.100 --> 3:06:28.740\n They're also determining who gets to receive\n\n3:06:28.740 --> 3:06:33.140\n that money first and the first recipients of that money\n\n3:06:33.140 --> 3:06:37.300\n are gonna be the beneficiaries in an inflationary regime.\n\n3:06:37.300 --> 3:06:39.060\n So those that receive the money last\n\n3:06:39.060 --> 3:06:40.620\n are the ones being robbed.\n\n3:06:40.620 --> 3:06:42.580\n Those that receive the money first are the ones\n\n3:06:42.580 --> 3:06:47.180\n that are receiving the stolen proceeds, let's say.\n\n3:06:48.460 --> 3:06:53.460\n And this has a really corrosive effect on social morality\n\n3:06:53.460 --> 3:06:58.460\n because if we consider that people's time horizon,\n\n3:06:59.620 --> 3:07:01.780\n which the Austrians call the time preference,\n\n3:07:02.940 --> 3:07:05.940\n the more short term thinking you are,\n\n3:07:05.940 --> 3:07:10.940\n the more likely you are to engage in selfish behavior.\n\n3:07:10.940 --> 3:07:14.580\n If you know that it's all over tomorrow\n\n3:07:15.580 --> 3:07:16.900\n and you've been working your whole life\n\n3:07:16.900 --> 3:07:20.380\n to develop this business or create this reputation\n\n3:07:20.380 --> 3:07:21.220\n or whatever your thing is,\n\n3:07:21.220 --> 3:07:23.660\n but you just are given the foreknowledge that tomorrow\n\n3:07:23.660 --> 3:07:26.620\n it's all gonna end, you're much more likely to go out\n\n3:07:26.620 --> 3:07:28.740\n and just maybe get drunk and party that night\n\n3:07:28.740 --> 3:07:30.740\n because there's no more repercussions.\n\n3:07:32.220 --> 3:07:35.700\n Whereas if you know that you're gonna live\n\n3:07:35.700 --> 3:07:38.860\n for a very long time, you're much more likely\n\n3:07:38.860 --> 3:07:40.420\n to plan for the future.\n\n3:07:45.140 --> 3:07:46.460\n So we just say that your time horizon\n\n3:07:46.460 --> 3:07:48.900\n is closely related to your morality.\n\n3:07:48.900 --> 3:07:51.500\n The longer term thinking you are, the more moral\n\n3:07:51.500 --> 3:07:53.140\n you would tend to behave, the more you would care\n\n3:07:53.140 --> 3:07:55.020\n about long term relationship building\n\n3:07:55.020 --> 3:07:57.580\n versus going out and getting wasted.\n\n3:07:57.580 --> 3:08:02.580\n And money too impinges very closely on our time preference.\n\n3:08:03.580 --> 3:08:05.300\n And again, time preference is the Austrian term.\n\n3:08:05.300 --> 3:08:09.020\n So low time preference means you're long term oriented,\n\n3:08:09.020 --> 3:08:11.260\n high time preference means you're short term oriented,\n\n3:08:11.260 --> 3:08:13.300\n which can be a little trippy for some people\n\n3:08:13.300 --> 3:08:14.460\n because it sounds backwards.\n\n3:08:14.460 --> 3:08:19.460\n But if your money constantly loses value,\n\n3:08:21.220 --> 3:08:25.460\n you are incentivized to become more short term oriented.\n\n3:08:25.460 --> 3:08:29.820\n You are handicapped in your ability to plan for the future\n\n3:08:29.820 --> 3:08:33.980\n because your money, which is intended to be,\n\n3:08:33.980 --> 3:08:35.380\n here's another definition of money,\n\n3:08:35.380 --> 3:08:38.260\n as an insurance policy against uncertainty.\n\n3:08:38.260 --> 3:08:40.580\n So no matter what problems you encounter in the world,\n\n3:08:40.580 --> 3:08:44.060\n this money will best help you deal with those problems.\n\n3:08:44.060 --> 3:08:46.660\n When that insurance policy against uncertainty\n\n3:08:46.660 --> 3:08:49.660\n is injected with uncertainty, it's polluted\n\n3:08:49.660 --> 3:08:51.500\n with the uncertainty of inflation,\n\n3:08:51.500 --> 3:08:53.060\n your time horizon shrinks,\n\n3:08:53.060 --> 3:08:55.300\n your ability to plan long term shrinks.\n\n3:08:55.300 --> 3:08:58.100\n And this impinges on social morality.\n\n3:08:58.100 --> 3:09:01.380\n So there's a great book on this called Honest Money\n\n3:09:01.380 --> 3:09:02.820\n by Gary North.\n\n3:09:02.820 --> 3:09:06.340\n And in that book, he gives the parable of the wine maker.\n\n3:09:06.340 --> 3:09:10.780\n And the wine maker, if we just imagine\n\n3:09:10.780 --> 3:09:12.420\n the hypothetical wine maker,\n\n3:09:12.420 --> 3:09:15.500\n operating a business in a centrally banked economy.\n\n3:09:15.500 --> 3:09:17.540\n And let's say his central bank just doubled\n\n3:09:17.540 --> 3:09:20.460\n the money supply to quote unquote save the economy.\n\n3:09:21.620 --> 3:09:24.780\n Say an increase in money supply from one to $2 trillion.\n\n3:09:24.780 --> 3:09:26.940\n This wine maker that's accustomed to selling wine\n\n3:09:26.940 --> 3:09:30.380\n at $20 a bottle is now faced with basically three choices.\n\n3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:36.020\n And an important point here too,\n\n3:09:36.020 --> 3:09:37.420\n before we get into his three choices,\n\n3:09:37.420 --> 3:09:39.340\n are what prices are themselves.\n\n3:09:39.340 --> 3:09:43.980\n Prices are the most visible aspect of any service.\n\n3:09:43.980 --> 3:09:45.940\n So when you increase prices,\n\n3:09:46.940 --> 3:09:49.740\n you're incentivizing your customers to look elsewhere.\n\n3:09:49.740 --> 3:09:51.380\n They're gonna look at your competition.\n\n3:09:51.380 --> 3:09:53.100\n When you decrease prices,\n\n3:09:53.100 --> 3:09:55.380\n you're incentivizing market actors\n\n3:09:55.380 --> 3:09:57.180\n to look closer at your product, right?\n\n3:09:57.180 --> 3:10:00.100\n You're delivering a solution at a lower price.\n\n3:10:00.100 --> 3:10:02.420\n So this wine maker that's accustomed to selling his wine\n\n3:10:02.420 --> 3:10:05.260\n at a $20 price point, all of a sudden,\n\n3:10:05.260 --> 3:10:07.900\n because of a central bank has tripled the money supply,\n\n3:10:07.900 --> 3:10:09.340\n he has three choices.\n\n3:10:10.260 --> 3:10:14.500\n He can either keep selling his bottle at $20\n\n3:10:14.500 --> 3:10:19.020\n and all of his inputs will increase due to inflation by 50%.\n\n3:10:19.020 --> 3:10:22.740\n So he will lose 50% of his profit margin as a result.\n\n3:10:24.220 --> 3:10:26.100\n So he can choose to eat that loss.\n\n3:10:26.100 --> 3:10:28.420\n He can choose to double the selling price\n\n3:10:28.420 --> 3:10:31.380\n of his bottle of wine from $20 to $40,\n\n3:10:31.380 --> 3:10:33.820\n because all of the price of his inputs doubled.\n\n3:10:33.820 --> 3:10:36.060\n So then he would maintain his profit margin.\n\n3:10:36.060 --> 3:10:40.100\n Or the third one is that he could choose\n\n3:10:40.100 --> 3:10:44.740\n to water down his wine or use inferior ingredients.\n\n3:10:44.740 --> 3:10:46.740\n So he could use cheaper inputs\n\n3:10:46.740 --> 3:10:49.460\n and maintain the output at the same price.\n\n3:10:51.100 --> 3:10:53.900\n So he could basically start selling his customers\n\n3:10:53.900 --> 3:10:55.460\n an inferior product for the same price\n\n3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:56.980\n to preserve his profit margin.\n\n3:10:57.980 --> 3:11:01.420\n Now, again, case number one, it's not very palatable.\n\n3:11:01.420 --> 3:11:03.220\n He doesn't wanna eat the economic loss.\n\n3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:06.020\n Case number two, he doesn't wanna eat the profit margin.\n\n3:11:06.020 --> 3:11:08.340\n Case number two, it's not very good either,\n\n3:11:08.340 --> 3:11:10.660\n because he's then incentivizing all of his customers\n\n3:11:10.660 --> 3:11:14.220\n to go shop other winemakers if he doubles his price.\n\n3:11:14.220 --> 3:11:16.580\n So human nature being what it is,\n\n3:11:16.580 --> 3:11:18.580\n trying to get something for nothing,\n\n3:11:18.580 --> 3:11:21.340\n inflation actually seeps into other industries\n\n3:11:21.340 --> 3:11:24.740\n by encouraging producers into option three,\n\n3:11:24.740 --> 3:11:27.940\n which is to deceive your customer in the short run.\n\n3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:31.020\n And again, this would be done initially at the margins.\n\n3:11:31.020 --> 3:11:32.460\n Maybe it's just a few drops of water.\n\n3:11:32.460 --> 3:11:35.260\n Maybe it's just some cheaper grapes.\n\n3:11:35.260 --> 3:11:40.260\n But over time, this inflation is actually inducing producers\n\n3:11:42.500 --> 3:11:45.300\n to weigh their financial wellbeing\n\n3:11:45.300 --> 3:11:47.300\n against their moral integrity.\n\n3:11:47.300 --> 3:11:49.700\n So it's forcing them into this dilemma\n\n3:11:49.700 --> 3:11:52.340\n that would not exist in a free market economy.\n\n3:11:53.220 --> 3:11:58.220\n And as they charge more money for wine that is inferior,\n\n3:11:58.940 --> 3:12:00.940\n the buyers of that wine,\n\n3:12:00.940 --> 3:12:02.620\n also living in a central banked economy\n\n3:12:02.620 --> 3:12:05.180\n are also getting scammed by not only the inflation,\n\n3:12:05.180 --> 3:12:06.420\n but also the wine.\n\n3:12:06.420 --> 3:12:10.940\n So it becomes this kind of corrosive contagious moral effect\n\n3:12:12.260 --> 3:12:14.860\n that propagates throughout an economy.\n\n3:12:14.860 --> 3:12:18.500\n And that's why I've argued in a lot of my writing\n\n3:12:18.500 --> 3:12:23.500\n that inflation is this infectious moral cancer on the world.\n\n3:12:24.100 --> 3:12:29.100\n I think it is tied back to a lot of the social strangeness\n\n3:12:30.860 --> 3:12:32.460\n we've seen in modern times,\n\n3:12:32.460 --> 3:12:35.900\n where there seems to be a lot of fake people\n\n3:12:35.900 --> 3:12:38.020\n and a lot of fake businesses and a lot of scams,\n\n3:12:38.020 --> 3:12:38.860\n all of these things.\n\n3:12:38.860 --> 3:12:40.940\n I think it really is rooted in the money.\n\n3:12:40.940 --> 3:12:45.100\n And Bitcoin, as the first money in history\n\n3:12:45.100 --> 3:12:47.340\n that has a 0% terminal inflation rate,\n\n3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:50.480\n or said differently, zero unexpected inflation.\n\n3:12:50.480 --> 3:12:54.340\n There's no theft integrated into Bitcoin.\n\n3:12:54.340 --> 3:12:56.020\n You can only earn it through work\n\n3:12:56.020 --> 3:12:58.280\n or sacrificing resources to obtain it.\n\n3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:03.280\n It is the antidote to this moral cancer\n\n3:13:03.760 --> 3:13:06.120\n that inflation riddles our society with.\n\n3:13:07.040 --> 3:13:08.820\n Again, you're blowing my mind a little bit\n\n3:13:08.820 --> 3:13:11.840\n to think about the ripple effects of inflation,\n\n3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:15.120\n the way it seeps through our interactions.\n\n3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:18.560\n So at the very, the early ripples\n\n3:13:18.560 --> 3:13:20.400\n is the effect it has on the products,\n\n3:13:20.400 --> 3:13:23.080\n on the dilution of the wine.\n\n3:13:23.080 --> 3:13:27.160\n But also it might have ripple effects on the character,\n\n3:13:27.160 --> 3:13:28.680\n on the behavior of people.\n\n3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:33.320\n That's interesting, artificial creation of scarcity,\n\n3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:38.320\n creating, having effects on society at the social,\n\n3:13:38.640 --> 3:13:40.200\n like the social fabric.\n\n3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:42.240\n And I guess you're arguing the morality.\n\n3:13:43.980 --> 3:13:45.960\n It's perverting free market dynamics,\n\n3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:49.000\n which again, we said free markets generate pragmatic truth.\n\n3:13:49.000 --> 3:13:52.000\n So inflation distorts price signals,\n\n3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:54.960\n which means it confuses capital allocation.\n\n3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:56.280\n So we're trying to solve problems,\n\n3:13:56.280 --> 3:13:58.080\n but all of a sudden we can't tell\n\n3:13:58.080 --> 3:13:59.560\n if this price increase is a matter\n\n3:13:59.560 --> 3:14:01.640\n of true supply and demand change\n\n3:14:01.640 --> 3:14:03.520\n or a matter of policy change.\n\n3:14:03.520 --> 3:14:07.200\n So it clouds our economic perceptions.\n\n3:14:07.200 --> 3:14:09.360\n It suppresses innovation\n\n3:14:09.360 --> 3:14:11.120\n because now you've exacerbated\n\n3:14:11.120 --> 3:14:12.520\n the boom and bust business cycle.\n\n3:14:12.520 --> 3:14:14.960\n People are gonna overborrow and go into projects\n\n3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:16.840\n that they can't profitably sustain.\n\n3:14:16.840 --> 3:14:18.360\n So then there'll be a huge collapse.\n\n3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:22.280\n So that actually breaks the market's function\n\n3:14:22.280 --> 3:14:24.080\n of generating innovation.\n\n3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:25.220\n And then, yeah, I would argue too\n\n3:14:25.220 --> 3:14:29.560\n that it pollutes our pursuit of virtue, let's say.\n\n3:14:29.560 --> 3:14:33.320\n Maybe it's pushing back, but I don't think so.\n\n3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:34.880\n It's not as clear to me,\n\n3:14:34.880 --> 3:14:36.860\n perhaps because I haven't thought about it deeply,\n\n3:14:36.860 --> 3:14:41.860\n that money is core to life and human interaction\n\n3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:45.600\n because there might be other forces,\n\n3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:48.900\n other fraudulent forces, other things in human nature\n\n3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:51.200\n that are creating these effects as well.\n\n3:14:51.200 --> 3:14:53.320\n So it's clear, I think you're articulating really well\n\n3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:56.200\n that there's these negative effects from inflation.\n\n3:14:56.200 --> 3:14:59.040\n I wonder if there's other undiscovered,\n\n3:14:59.040 --> 3:15:02.320\n not undiscovered, but ones we're not making explicit now,\n\n3:15:02.320 --> 3:15:07.320\n forces that are creating all the things we're seeing now\n\n3:15:08.600 --> 3:15:11.500\n with, like you said, cancer culture and all those things,\n\n3:15:11.500 --> 3:15:16.500\n but also the negative effects on the quality of products,\n\n3:15:16.920 --> 3:15:20.360\n on the excellence of the creativity and the innovation,\n\n3:15:20.360 --> 3:15:21.200\n all those kinds of things.\n\n3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:23.160\n I wonder if there's other factors.\n\n3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:26.760\n It's kind of, listen, it's compelling to think money's\n\n3:15:26.760 --> 3:15:28.360\n at the core of it all.\n\n3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:30.760\n Like if you fix, I forgot what the phrase was.\n\n3:15:30.760 --> 3:15:31.760\n Fix the money, fix the world.\n\n3:15:31.760 --> 3:15:33.560\n Yeah, fix the money, fix the world.\n\n3:15:35.640 --> 3:15:40.520\n Again, things that sound good, I'm skeptical of by nature.\n\n3:15:40.520 --> 3:15:44.480\n So I wonder if there's other things that are beyond money\n\n3:15:44.480 --> 3:15:47.320\n that are somehow deeply integrated into our human nature.\n\n3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:51.640\n Another one related to money is social cohesion itself.\n\n3:15:51.640 --> 3:15:56.640\n So very simple anecdote for this was the more you increase\n\n3:15:57.140 --> 3:16:01.120\n the inflation rate, social cohesion is inversely\n\n3:16:01.120 --> 3:16:02.140\n proportionate to that.\n\n3:16:02.140 --> 3:16:04.620\n So the extreme example would be hyperinflation, right?\n\n3:16:04.620 --> 3:16:07.300\n Where the money is produced in such excess\n\n3:16:07.300 --> 3:16:09.800\n that it loses all meaning and relevance.\n\n3:16:09.800 --> 3:16:14.400\n So today in Venezuela, there is cash clogging the gutters,\n\n3:16:14.400 --> 3:16:16.720\n clogging the streets, clogging the sewer system,\n\n3:16:17.700 --> 3:16:21.160\n because the cash has lost all relevance.\n\n3:16:21.160 --> 3:16:23.640\n And so anecdotally, we would suspect that,\n\n3:16:23.640 --> 3:16:27.080\n okay, if there's a inverse relationship\n\n3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:29.960\n between inflation and social cohesion,\n\n3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:32.700\n if we could then take inflation to zero,\n\n3:16:32.700 --> 3:16:34.520\n couldn't we theoretically increase\n\n3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:36.980\n social cohesion to its maximum?\n\n3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:40.600\n So another way to say that is inflation\n\n3:16:40.600 --> 3:16:45.600\n is a decivilizing force, whereas natural price deflation,\n\n3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:48.600\n which would occur in a hard money economy,\n\n3:16:48.600 --> 3:16:51.040\n where there's either a fixed supply of Bitcoin\n\n3:16:51.040 --> 3:16:56.040\n or a relatively scarce supply of gold, for instance,\n\n3:16:56.200 --> 3:17:00.280\n that lays claim to an increasing capital stock\n\n3:17:00.280 --> 3:17:03.500\n of goods and services, prices would naturally decline\n\n3:17:03.500 --> 3:17:06.120\n every year as we became smarter.\n\n3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:07.840\n So the market price becomes a reflection\n\n3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:09.840\n of our collective knowledge.\n\n3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:12.680\n So by letting prices decline naturally over time,\n\n3:17:12.680 --> 3:17:16.120\n we can actually induce civilization.\n\n3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:18.640\n But by trying to force prices higher all the time\n\n3:17:18.640 --> 3:17:21.880\n via the central bank, we're creating the opposite effect.\n\n3:17:21.880 --> 3:17:24.160\n So we talked a little bit about the Soviet Union,\n\n3:17:24.160 --> 3:17:26.380\n and I happened to have lived through the collapse\n\n3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:27.460\n of the Soviet Union.\n\n3:17:28.780 --> 3:17:33.780\n And so what are the factors, the causes in your mind\n\n3:17:34.660 --> 3:17:36.900\n to why the Soviet Union collapsed?\n\n3:17:38.280 --> 3:17:42.920\n So, you know, definitely a multivariate situation.\n\n3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:45.160\n I think there's a lot of factors.\n\n3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:48.860\n One that jumped out to me recently,\n\n3:17:48.860 --> 3:17:51.420\n again, from that documentary that I didn't note before\n\n3:17:51.420 --> 3:17:54.060\n was that at one point, Stalin eliminated,\n\n3:17:54.060 --> 3:17:56.940\n I think 75% of his intelligence force,\n\n3:17:59.420 --> 3:18:01.300\n which I think when you're competing\n\n3:18:01.300 --> 3:18:04.100\n with another nation state, you know,\n\n3:18:04.100 --> 3:18:06.820\n and intelligence and covert operations\n\n3:18:06.820 --> 3:18:08.820\n are very integral to your survival,\n\n3:18:08.820 --> 3:18:13.560\n I think that was definitely a shot in the foot.\n\n3:18:13.560 --> 3:18:18.560\n But at a higher level, I would say that capitalism\n\n3:18:19.780 --> 3:18:23.620\n and communism were each resource strategies\n\n3:18:23.620 --> 3:18:25.600\n of the 20th century nation state.\n\n3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:30.080\n And they seem, you know, we commonly consider them\n\n3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:31.460\n to be diametrically opposed,\n\n3:18:31.460 --> 3:18:34.780\n but there's actually a lot of commonality between the two.\n\n3:18:34.780 --> 3:18:38.260\n The difference would be that in Soviet Russia,\n\n3:18:39.300 --> 3:18:40.460\n as we alluded to earlier,\n\n3:18:40.460 --> 3:18:43.580\n they tried to completely replace price signals\n\n3:18:44.720 --> 3:18:46.860\n with this nationalistic faith and devotion.\n\n3:18:46.860 --> 3:18:50.660\n So they removed the economic nerve signal,\n\n3:18:50.660 --> 3:18:53.700\n which coordinated the allocation of capital over time.\n\n3:18:53.700 --> 3:18:57.020\n So this inhibited their ability to generate wealth.\n\n3:18:57.020 --> 3:18:58.240\n Whereas in the United States,\n\n3:18:58.240 --> 3:19:02.340\n we left most markets open to free enterprise.\n\n3:19:02.340 --> 3:19:06.100\n So we honored the integrity of price signals\n\n3:19:06.100 --> 3:19:11.100\n and we allowed people to trade and accumulate wealth.\n\n3:19:11.680 --> 3:19:14.600\n So in every market, except the market for money,\n\n3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:18.280\n both markets maintained a central bank as we've gotten to.\n\n3:19:18.280 --> 3:19:23.060\n So I think in a really big picture standpoint,\n\n3:19:23.060 --> 3:19:27.540\n that's why capitalism outcompetes communism\n\n3:19:27.540 --> 3:19:31.220\n is because it is able to generate more wealth\n\n3:19:31.220 --> 3:19:32.940\n than communism was,\n\n3:19:32.940 --> 3:19:35.620\n and therefore was able to put financial pressure\n\n3:19:35.620 --> 3:19:39.340\n on the USSR until it reached the point of bankruptcy,\n\n3:19:39.340 --> 3:19:40.180\n essentially.\n\n3:19:41.180 --> 3:19:44.120\n A similar model, I would argue,\n\n3:19:44.120 --> 3:19:48.580\n is that for the same reasons we saw\n\n3:19:48.580 --> 3:19:50.100\n capitalism outcompete communism,\n\n3:19:50.100 --> 3:19:53.880\n which I think the data that I recall\n\n3:19:53.880 --> 3:19:56.580\n was that the USSR's economy was valued\n\n3:19:56.580 --> 3:19:59.660\n at close to one third of its inputs.\n\n3:19:59.660 --> 3:20:02.820\n So if you just didn't do anything inside the USSR\n\n3:20:02.820 --> 3:20:05.380\n and just sold all the raw materials that were going into it,\n\n3:20:05.380 --> 3:20:07.940\n it would have been worth three times as much\n\n3:20:07.940 --> 3:20:09.820\n as sending the materials in,\n\n3:20:09.820 --> 3:20:10.900\n running it through the efforts\n\n3:20:10.900 --> 3:20:12.620\n and then shipping things back out.\n\n3:20:12.620 --> 3:20:16.260\n It was value destructive versus value creative.\n\n3:20:16.260 --> 3:20:18.580\n And I would argue this is because,\n\n3:20:18.580 --> 3:20:21.420\n again, the centralized computing model\n\n3:20:21.420 --> 3:20:23.340\n versus decentralized computing model,\n\n3:20:23.340 --> 3:20:26.160\n it just became more and more corrupt over time.\n\n3:20:27.780 --> 3:20:30.900\n It got to the point where I think most of the occupations\n\n3:20:30.900 --> 3:20:34.220\n in USSR towards the end were as informants, right?\n\n3:20:34.220 --> 3:20:35.820\n They were working for the state.\n\n3:20:37.140 --> 3:20:38.500\n Jordan Peterson makes this point too,\n\n3:20:38.500 --> 3:20:40.540\n that at some point it was actually illegal\n\n3:20:40.540 --> 3:20:43.100\n to be sad in Soviet Russia.\n\n3:20:43.100 --> 3:20:44.980\n Because if you were sad,\n\n3:20:44.980 --> 3:20:48.900\n you were contradicting the utopian view of the state.\n\n3:20:48.900 --> 3:20:49.740\n So if you were sad,\n\n3:20:49.740 --> 3:20:51.940\n you're implying the state's not doing something wrong.\n\n3:20:51.940 --> 3:20:53.780\n But by the way, this does remind me,\n\n3:20:55.020 --> 3:20:57.180\n do you know what Jordan Peterson thinks about Bitcoin\n\n3:20:57.180 --> 3:21:02.180\n and about the future impact of Bitcoin on the society?\n\n3:21:02.180 --> 3:21:05.540\n No, I don't actually.\n\n3:21:06.980 --> 3:21:10.620\n We're hopefully gonna be talking to him soon about that.\n\n3:21:10.620 --> 3:21:14.140\n We did a book club on his book, Maps of Meaning,\n\n3:21:14.140 --> 3:21:16.100\n and he engaged with us about it.\n\n3:21:16.100 --> 3:21:19.060\n So we're hoping to deliver the orange bill to Mr. Peterson.\n\n3:21:19.060 --> 3:21:20.660\n The orange bill.\n\n3:21:20.660 --> 3:21:24.020\n I think his audience is one of the most important audiences\n\n3:21:24.020 --> 3:21:25.340\n in the world to understand Bitcoin,\n\n3:21:25.340 --> 3:21:29.380\n these people that are conscientious and responsible.\n\n3:21:29.380 --> 3:21:34.380\n I think they'll quickly understand Bitcoin's\n\n3:21:34.660 --> 3:21:38.460\n value proposition and help elucidate it to the world.\n\n3:21:38.460 --> 3:21:41.180\n I'm trying to remember what he said about it.\n\n3:21:41.180 --> 3:21:44.180\n Basically, I think his support of Bitcoin\n\n3:21:44.180 --> 3:21:47.060\n is grounded in the kind of people\n\n3:21:47.060 --> 3:21:48.700\n who are opposing Bitcoin.\n\n3:21:49.860 --> 3:21:52.700\n So without understanding Bitcoin,\n\n3:21:52.700 --> 3:21:54.420\n he starts to like Bitcoin\n\n3:21:54.420 --> 3:21:56.620\n because of the people who are opposing it.\n\n3:21:56.620 --> 3:21:59.580\n He's, you know, you start to, I mean,\n\n3:21:59.580 --> 3:22:03.660\n that's partially why I am interested in Bitcoin.\n\n3:22:03.660 --> 3:22:08.540\n It's like all the people in power\n\n3:22:08.540 --> 3:22:12.340\n and all the kind of shady, fraudulent,\n\n3:22:12.340 --> 3:22:15.900\n non genuine people who are dismissing Bitcoin\n\n3:22:17.540 --> 3:22:19.420\n are making me think, hmm.\n\n3:22:19.420 --> 3:22:23.500\n One of Jordan's definitions of God is,\n\n3:22:23.500 --> 3:22:26.740\n he says, God is found in the truthful speech\n\n3:22:26.740 --> 3:22:29.140\n that rectifies pathological hierarchies.\n\n3:22:30.300 --> 3:22:34.660\n And I think that is a beautiful definition\n\n3:22:34.660 --> 3:22:36.660\n of what Bitcoin is doing in the world.\n\n3:22:36.660 --> 3:22:39.060\n And that we have this pathological hierarchy\n\n3:22:39.060 --> 3:22:40.820\n called central banking,\n\n3:22:40.820 --> 3:22:43.580\n by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer,\n\n3:22:45.020 --> 3:22:48.260\n that is used as a mechanism for perpetual theft\n\n3:22:48.260 --> 3:22:51.300\n and funding warfare at a global scale.\n\n3:22:51.300 --> 3:22:53.540\n Like Ron Paul said, it's no coincidence\n\n3:22:53.540 --> 3:22:56.020\n that the 20th century of total war\n\n3:22:56.020 --> 3:22:58.020\n was also the century of central banking.\n\n3:22:59.540 --> 3:23:04.540\n When you have an institution of currency counterfeiting,\n\n3:23:04.540 --> 3:23:06.660\n which the central bank is,\n\n3:23:06.660 --> 3:23:09.340\n you are no longer bounded by your own balance sheet\n\n3:23:09.340 --> 3:23:10.300\n when you go to war.\n\n3:23:10.300 --> 3:23:12.340\n You don't have to just go to war on your own resources.\n\n3:23:12.340 --> 3:23:15.180\n You can now pillage the commonwealth\n\n3:23:15.180 --> 3:23:18.940\n and pull for the savings of society as a whole\n\n3:23:18.940 --> 3:23:21.380\n before you go bankrupt.\n\n3:23:21.380 --> 3:23:23.900\n And indeed, this is what Hitler did, right?\n\n3:23:23.900 --> 3:23:28.260\n Hitler hyperinflated in the Weimar Republic\n\n3:23:28.260 --> 3:23:30.460\n to fund his war efforts.\n\n3:23:31.780 --> 3:23:35.620\n And frankly, every dictator, every world war,\n\n3:23:35.620 --> 3:23:39.700\n every internment camp in history was made possible\n\n3:23:39.700 --> 3:23:43.460\n by the weaponization of money in fiat currency.\n\n3:23:43.460 --> 3:23:46.900\n So I hope, I know Jordan Peterson\n\n3:23:46.900 --> 3:23:49.340\n is a huge proponent of free speech.\n\n3:23:49.340 --> 3:23:51.740\n And I think that's ultimately at its deepest essence,\n\n3:23:51.740 --> 3:23:53.180\n that's what Bitcoin really is, right?\n\n3:23:53.180 --> 3:23:55.420\n It is just the purest form\n\n3:23:55.420 --> 3:23:58.540\n of monetary speech we've ever had.\n\n3:23:58.540 --> 3:24:02.940\n And by purifying that primary operating system\n\n3:24:02.940 --> 3:24:06.180\n of human action, I think we can eliminate\n\n3:24:06.180 --> 3:24:09.220\n this pathological hierarchy that is unfortunately\n\n3:24:09.220 --> 3:24:11.780\n the dominant institution in the world today.\n\n3:24:11.780 --> 3:24:13.380\n Yeah, I'm definitely,\n\n3:24:13.380 --> 3:24:16.340\n especially with these explorations of Bitcoin,\n\n3:24:16.340 --> 3:24:18.020\n this journey I've been on,\n\n3:24:18.020 --> 3:24:21.380\n I'll revisit some of the aspects of human history\n\n3:24:21.380 --> 3:24:24.620\n that I've been looking at like Stalin and Hitler\n\n3:24:24.620 --> 3:24:28.820\n with a, from a perspective of a monetary perspective,\n\n3:24:28.820 --> 3:24:33.140\n like what are the effects of inflation?\n\n3:24:33.140 --> 3:24:37.980\n How was it used as a tool in gaining power\n\n3:24:37.980 --> 3:24:42.980\n and maintaining power and manipulating the populace\n\n3:24:42.980 --> 3:24:47.820\n in doing, in inflicting suffering\n\n3:24:47.820 --> 3:24:51.380\n and I would say evil onto the world.\n\n3:24:51.380 --> 3:24:52.260\n It's interesting.\n\n3:24:52.260 --> 3:24:54.740\n I, it's interesting.\n\n3:24:54.740 --> 3:24:56.860\n I'm gonna have to sort of go back into the hole.\n\n3:24:56.860 --> 3:25:01.700\n So I tend to focus more on the human nature\n\n3:25:02.780 --> 3:25:05.780\n and less about the tools\n\n3:25:05.780 --> 3:25:08.820\n that human nature leverages to affect change.\n\n3:25:08.820 --> 3:25:11.100\n But you're right that in some sense,\n\n3:25:11.100 --> 3:25:16.100\n money is a tool which can be effectively used\n\n3:25:17.500 --> 3:25:21.740\n to perform moral and immoral actions\n\n3:25:21.740 --> 3:25:23.500\n depending on how it's used.\n\n3:25:23.500 --> 3:25:25.660\n There's a feedback between the two, right?\n\n3:25:25.660 --> 3:25:30.660\n There's, specifically with money itself,\n\n3:25:31.700 --> 3:25:36.700\n it's the, here's the way I've been posing it lately\n\n3:25:36.700 --> 3:25:39.700\n is that I actually think we typically think of people\n\n3:25:39.700 --> 3:25:41.540\n as good or bad, or again,\n\n3:25:41.540 --> 3:25:43.300\n trying to label people all the time,\n\n3:25:43.300 --> 3:25:45.620\n but I think people and their characters\n\n3:25:45.620 --> 3:25:48.540\n are emergent properties of the incentive structures\n\n3:25:48.540 --> 3:25:49.380\n they inhabit.\n\n3:25:49.380 --> 3:25:50.220\n Yeah.\n\n3:25:50.220 --> 3:25:53.060\n So, you know, what does Charlie Munger say?\n\n3:25:53.060 --> 3:25:54.300\n Don't show me the incentives,\n\n3:25:54.300 --> 3:25:56.900\n I'll show you the outcome kind of thing.\n\n3:25:56.900 --> 3:25:59.180\n This is a flawed incentive structure\n\n3:25:59.180 --> 3:26:01.100\n we've been operating within.\n\n3:26:01.100 --> 3:26:03.220\n Now I'm not speaking to the intention.\n\n3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:04.620\n People want to argue with me all the time.\n\n3:26:04.620 --> 3:26:06.980\n Like Jerome Powell's not a bad guy.\n\n3:26:06.980 --> 3:26:08.620\n He's doing his best at the central bank.\n\n3:26:08.620 --> 3:26:09.940\n He's doing what he thinks is right.\n\n3:26:09.940 --> 3:26:10.780\n That's fine.\n\n3:26:11.780 --> 3:26:13.700\n Well, that's true or not, it actually doesn't matter.\n\n3:26:13.700 --> 3:26:16.420\n The intention is divergent from the outcome.\n\n3:26:16.420 --> 3:26:18.020\n The institution that they are running\n\n3:26:18.020 --> 3:26:20.340\n is premised on deception and theft,\n\n3:26:20.340 --> 3:26:22.980\n and it is handicapping the productive economy.\n\n3:26:22.980 --> 3:26:26.300\n So when we're, even the terms we use, printing money,\n\n3:26:26.300 --> 3:26:27.980\n you're not creating any new value.\n\n3:26:27.980 --> 3:26:29.860\n You're not infusing the economy with anything,\n\n3:26:29.860 --> 3:26:31.860\n any new productive factors whatsoever.\n\n3:26:31.860 --> 3:26:33.540\n You're just creating new value.\n\n3:26:33.540 --> 3:26:35.260\n You're not infusing the economy with anything,\n\n3:26:35.260 --> 3:26:37.220\n any new productive factors whatsoever.\n\n3:26:37.220 --> 3:26:39.500\n You're just harvesting the economic surplus\n\n3:26:39.500 --> 3:26:42.300\n created by entrepreneurs in the marketplace.\n\n3:26:42.300 --> 3:26:45.300\n It's impossible to add any value to an economy\n\n3:26:45.300 --> 3:26:48.420\n by increasing the paper claims on its savings.\n\n3:26:48.420 --> 3:26:53.420\n So there's a feedback loop between man and tool,\n\n3:26:54.460 --> 3:26:56.020\n between creator and created.\n\n3:26:56.020 --> 3:26:59.780\n And I think we have to honor the relationship\n\n3:26:59.780 --> 3:27:01.300\n above either one, right?\n\n3:27:01.300 --> 3:27:03.300\n Trying to put the right people in the system\n\n3:27:03.300 --> 3:27:04.140\n in the right place.\n\n3:27:04.140 --> 3:27:05.220\n Do you think the interesting question\n\n3:27:05.220 --> 3:27:10.220\n of whether the people that are in control of central banks\n\n3:27:12.060 --> 3:27:14.700\n or in positions of power there,\n\n3:27:14.700 --> 3:27:17.220\n if they themselves are malevolent,\n\n3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:19.820\n they themselves are bad actors,\n\n3:27:19.820 --> 3:27:24.820\n or they're simply like leaves floating along the river,\n\n3:27:25.220 --> 3:27:29.820\n sort of just the cog in the machine,\n\n3:27:29.820 --> 3:27:31.380\n an ant in an ant colony\n\n3:27:31.380 --> 3:27:33.940\n that operates in a certain kind of way.\n\n3:27:33.940 --> 3:27:36.740\n Like, where do you put the blame?\n\n3:27:36.740 --> 3:27:40.740\n Do you put the blame on the way things are operating\n\n3:27:40.740 --> 3:27:44.460\n onto the individuals or onto the system itself,\n\n3:27:44.460 --> 3:27:46.980\n the idea behind the system?\n\n3:27:46.980 --> 3:27:50.860\n Where, and is it useful to place the blame somewhere?\n\n3:27:50.860 --> 3:27:53.380\n Because for me, it might be useful to understand that\n\n3:27:53.380 --> 3:27:57.080\n in order to figure out what the solution is.\n\n3:27:57.080 --> 3:27:59.840\n I tend to not put the blame on the individual.\n\n3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:02.460\n Like I tend to believe most people are good\n\n3:28:02.460 --> 3:28:04.320\n and want to see themselves as good.\n\n3:28:05.340 --> 3:28:07.760\n And so in that case, it's very difficult\n\n3:28:07.760 --> 3:28:11.100\n to be truly malevolent as you would need to be to control,\n\n3:28:11.100 --> 3:28:13.880\n to gain centralized power at the large scale.\n\n3:28:14.820 --> 3:28:18.180\n But I know a lot of conspiracy theorists\n\n3:28:19.140 --> 3:28:23.140\n and just a lot of people think that there is evil humans\n\n3:28:23.140 --> 3:28:26.700\n in the world that seek power, maintain that power,\n\n3:28:26.700 --> 3:28:29.940\n and then use that power for bad purposes.\n\n3:28:29.940 --> 3:28:32.300\n I think they're just people.\n\n3:28:32.300 --> 3:28:34.380\n And they're just trying to get something for nothing,\n\n3:28:34.380 --> 3:28:35.380\n like all of us do.\n\n3:28:35.380 --> 3:28:37.860\n I like this framework of thought.\n\n3:28:37.860 --> 3:28:42.120\n Well, honestly, and that's what the central bank is,\n\n3:28:42.120 --> 3:28:44.980\n is the ultimate institution to get something for nothing.\n\n3:28:44.980 --> 3:28:49.680\n You get a perpetual income stream,\n\n3:28:49.680 --> 3:28:53.260\n the ability to acquire more and more territory in the world\n\n3:28:53.260 --> 3:28:56.020\n through monopolizing the supply of money.\n\n3:28:56.620 --> 3:28:59.260\n And you can literally print money.\n\n3:28:59.260 --> 3:29:01.300\n You can buy your way out of anything\n\n3:29:01.300 --> 3:29:03.740\n and buy your way into anything in the world.\n\n3:29:03.740 --> 3:29:08.740\n So it is, I think the most, not say the most,\n\n3:29:08.900 --> 3:29:10.820\n but a group of very intelligent people\n\n3:29:10.820 --> 3:29:12.740\n put this thing together and figured out\n\n3:29:12.740 --> 3:29:15.140\n how to get something for nothing in perpetuity\n\n3:29:17.780 --> 3:29:20.540\n by clouding people's conception of money.\n\n3:29:20.540 --> 3:29:24.780\n And if we look at the central bank is,\n\n3:29:24.780 --> 3:29:25.700\n it's been around for a while,\n\n3:29:25.700 --> 3:29:29.420\n but the latest implementation here in the US is the Fed.\n\n3:29:29.420 --> 3:29:30.540\n It's about a hundred years old.\n\n3:29:30.540 --> 3:29:34.240\n It's an analog age institution that I think has lost\n\n3:29:34.240 --> 3:29:37.900\n a lot of its relevance in the modern age.\n\n3:29:37.900 --> 3:29:40.160\n And I don't think it will survive\n\n3:29:40.160 --> 3:29:43.020\n the ever galvanizing gaze of the digital age.\n\n3:29:43.020 --> 3:29:47.020\n There's just too much sunlight, too much transparency today.\n\n3:29:47.020 --> 3:29:49.380\n Ideas move too quickly for something like this\n\n3:29:49.380 --> 3:29:51.300\n to remain relevant.\n\n3:29:51.300 --> 3:29:53.980\n But they are just people.\n\n3:29:53.980 --> 3:29:55.740\n They are just seeking something for nothing.\n\n3:29:55.740 --> 3:29:58.220\n But I think when you concentrate that much power\n\n3:29:58.220 --> 3:30:00.340\n and that much control, that much wealth\n\n3:30:00.340 --> 3:30:04.980\n into the hands of few, it does change.\n\n3:30:04.980 --> 3:30:07.780\n Hayek argued that the nature of power,\n\n3:30:09.300 --> 3:30:11.580\n again, it's something that we all sort of desire.\n\n3:30:11.580 --> 3:30:14.100\n To be completely powerless, you're really unhappy, right?\n\n3:30:14.100 --> 3:30:16.340\n If you're totally powerless, you're a slave.\n\n3:30:16.340 --> 3:30:17.700\n Someone else tells you what to do.\n\n3:30:17.700 --> 3:30:18.980\n You have no autonomy.\n\n3:30:18.980 --> 3:30:20.580\n It's miserable, right?\n\n3:30:20.580 --> 3:30:23.140\n So there's this, it makes the consolidation\n\n3:30:23.140 --> 3:30:25.880\n of power alluring and that we want to protect ourselves\n\n3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:28.360\n from that slave state, let's say.\n\n3:30:28.360 --> 3:30:30.740\n But like many things, it can be taken too far.\n\n3:30:31.660 --> 3:30:35.480\n And when you concentrate power into too few hands,\n\n3:30:35.480 --> 3:30:38.460\n Hayek argues that it actually transforms.\n\n3:30:38.460 --> 3:30:41.020\n It becomes something much more intoxicating\n\n3:30:41.020 --> 3:30:44.140\n than it would be if it was held in a more distributed way.\n\n3:30:44.140 --> 3:30:47.380\n And I think that gets into a lot of these,\n\n3:30:47.380 --> 3:30:50.200\n I don't know if they call themselves elites\n\n3:30:50.200 --> 3:30:51.720\n or people call them elites or whatever,\n\n3:30:51.720 --> 3:30:54.920\n like let's say shareholders of central banks,\n\n3:30:54.920 --> 3:30:56.760\n people participating in the World Economic Forum,\n\n3:30:56.760 --> 3:30:57.740\n things like this.\n\n3:30:59.260 --> 3:31:01.700\n They come, I guess the incentives, right?\n\n3:31:01.700 --> 3:31:05.400\n The incentive schema they're in is rewarding them constantly,\n\n3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:06.680\n telling them everything they're doing,\n\n3:31:06.680 --> 3:31:08.000\n saying and thinking is correct\n\n3:31:08.000 --> 3:31:10.880\n because they just keep getting richer all the time.\n\n3:31:10.880 --> 3:31:15.140\n And it leads you closer to this definition of evil,\n\n3:31:15.140 --> 3:31:19.200\n which in the book, Paradise Lost,\n\n3:31:19.200 --> 3:31:20.940\n Friedman said, evil is the force\n\n3:31:20.940 --> 3:31:23.740\n which believes its knowledge is complete.\n\n3:31:23.740 --> 3:31:27.380\n So these people become more and more convinced\n\n3:31:27.380 --> 3:31:32.180\n that they have the plan or they have the course of action\n\n3:31:32.180 --> 3:31:33.280\n that will save the world,\n\n3:31:33.280 --> 3:31:35.640\n that if everyone would just listen to them,\n\n3:31:35.640 --> 3:31:38.000\n that they would lead us to the promised land, right?\n\n3:31:38.000 --> 3:31:41.160\n Whether this is Bill Gates saving us from a climate crisis\n\n3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:44.560\n or any of these other economic policies\n\n3:31:44.560 --> 3:31:46.420\n that are targeted at a certain outcome,\n\n3:31:46.420 --> 3:31:49.300\n but almost always diverge almost perfectly\n\n3:31:49.300 --> 3:31:51.700\n from that outcome, creating its opposite effect.\n\n3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:55.600\n I think that's the problem,\n\n3:31:55.600 --> 3:31:58.700\n that we have this mechanism that can concentrate wealth\n\n3:31:58.700 --> 3:32:01.440\n and power into the hands of so few\n\n3:32:01.440 --> 3:32:04.420\n that it leads to the proliferation of evil,\n\n3:32:05.660 --> 3:32:06.980\n meaning that it convinces people\n\n3:32:06.980 --> 3:32:08.280\n that their knowledge is complete.\n\n3:32:08.280 --> 3:32:12.760\n Whereas something like a Bitcoin\n\n3:32:12.760 --> 3:32:14.660\n almost forces the opposite outcome.\n\n3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:22.220\n In a Bitcoin denominated world, a pure free market,\n\n3:32:22.220 --> 3:32:24.480\n the consumer is sovereign.\n\n3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:28.000\n So you cannot earn value in the world\n\n3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:30.520\n unless you are serving your fellow man,\n\n3:32:30.520 --> 3:32:34.060\n unless they have expressed through their buy and sell\n\n3:32:34.060 --> 3:32:35.800\n decisions in the marketplace, right?\n\n3:32:35.800 --> 3:32:39.560\n You've created a satisfaction of a particular want\n\n3:32:39.560 --> 3:32:41.520\n that they value so much,\n\n3:32:41.520 --> 3:32:43.160\n they've acquired so much of your good or service\n\n3:32:43.160 --> 3:32:45.180\n that you've become rich.\n\n3:32:45.180 --> 3:32:47.200\n You can only maintain that position of wealth\n\n3:32:47.200 --> 3:32:49.960\n so long as you continue to serve your fellow man.\n\n3:32:49.960 --> 3:32:54.240\n So it changes the incentives such that dominance\n\n3:32:54.240 --> 3:32:59.080\n in the world can no longer be paired with coercion.\n\n3:32:59.080 --> 3:33:01.660\n It has to be paired with competence.\n\n3:33:01.660 --> 3:33:05.460\n And that's how this, when we say Bitcoin fixes this,\n\n3:33:05.460 --> 3:33:06.300\n that's what we mean.\n\n3:33:06.300 --> 3:33:09.320\n Like it restores that skin in the game,\n\n3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:11.380\n that balance of incentives and disincentives\n\n3:33:11.380 --> 3:33:13.920\n that help us properly navigate reality.\n\n3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:17.280\n And it prevents the buildup of systemic rot\n\n3:33:17.280 --> 3:33:19.120\n like we see with the central bank.\n\n3:33:20.240 --> 3:33:21.400\n What books?\n\n3:33:21.400 --> 3:33:23.120\n People love this question.\n\n3:33:23.120 --> 3:33:25.840\n And you're exceptionally well read.\n\n3:33:25.840 --> 3:33:28.200\n You've explored all kinds of ideas.\n\n3:33:28.200 --> 3:33:31.960\n Is there some books, technical, fiction, philosophical,\n\n3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:35.680\n coloring books, children's books had an impact on your life\n\n3:33:35.680 --> 3:33:38.760\n and you would maybe recommend to others\n\n3:33:38.760 --> 3:33:39.860\n that they should read?\n\n3:33:39.860 --> 3:33:43.160\n I think we mentioned a couple of them here today,\n\n3:33:43.160 --> 3:33:47.780\n but I think a really useful triplet of books\n\n3:33:49.180 --> 3:33:50.880\n that I've been recommending recently\n\n3:33:51.760 --> 3:33:56.080\n to help diffuse this materialist worldview of reality\n\n3:33:56.080 --> 3:33:58.920\n where we still think in kind of the Newtonian model\n\n3:33:58.920 --> 3:34:01.200\n that it's atoms and cause and effect.\n\n3:34:03.440 --> 3:34:05.160\n I'd first recommend Jordan Peterson's book,\n\n3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:06.160\n Maps of Meaning.\n\n3:34:06.160 --> 3:34:11.160\n It's a deep dive into mythology\n\n3:34:11.240 --> 3:34:14.160\n and how it's developed over the course of history\n\n3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:17.260\n and how it's reflected both in our social structures\n\n3:34:17.260 --> 3:34:21.360\n and our intra psychic nature really,\n\n3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:23.320\n and how they come to reflect one another in a way.\n\n3:34:23.320 --> 3:34:25.800\n Like the way we think again shapes the world\n\n3:34:25.800 --> 3:34:26.960\n and then the way the world is shaped,\n\n3:34:26.960 --> 3:34:28.160\n shapes the way we think.\n\n3:34:29.760 --> 3:34:30.800\n That's an excellent book.\n\n3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:33.480\n It's very dense and difficult read.\n\n3:34:33.480 --> 3:34:35.360\n Actually this trilogy is pretty brutal.\n\n3:34:35.360 --> 3:34:38.540\n Probably take you a year to read, hours a day.\n\n3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:40.640\n The second one I mentioned earlier\n\n3:34:40.640 --> 3:34:42.420\n was Human Action by Mises.\n\n3:34:44.320 --> 3:34:46.560\n The ultimate tome on Austrian economics\n\n3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:50.240\n will help explicate this realm of relevance.\n\n3:34:50.240 --> 3:34:54.400\n I think that economics truly is where again,\n\n3:34:56.040 --> 3:35:00.080\n there are things and then these things become means or ends\n\n3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:03.200\n once we channel our purpose through them.\n\n3:35:03.200 --> 3:35:07.520\n So this realm of non materialist relevance\n\n3:35:07.520 --> 3:35:10.480\n that I think is really important to grasping economics\n\n3:35:10.480 --> 3:35:11.720\n at a first principles level,\n\n3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:14.040\n I think that book lays it out tremendously.\n\n3:35:15.400 --> 3:35:16.480\n And then the last one would be,\n\n3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:17.560\n I think I mentioned this at the beginning,\n\n3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:19.960\n was that book Lila by Robert Persig,\n\n3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:23.800\n where he's making the case that value is fundamental.\n\n3:35:23.800 --> 3:35:25.640\n And all of these books,\n\n3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:27.560\n they kind of all point to that actually.\n\n3:35:27.560 --> 3:35:31.080\n They're pointing back to value being the fundamental thing,\n\n3:35:31.080 --> 3:35:35.320\n values expressed through moral action\n\n3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:37.920\n as being the fundamental substrate of reality.\n\n3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:42.040\n So if you're like me, I grew up quite scientific minded.\n\n3:35:42.040 --> 3:35:43.320\n It'll help diffuse some of that\n\n3:35:43.320 --> 3:35:45.920\n and maybe retrain you to the other side of reality.\n\n3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:49.200\n So you said these books are difficult.\n\n3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:52.800\n Maybe you can comment on which aspect is difficult.\n\n3:35:52.800 --> 3:35:54.400\n Is it just the technical nature?\n\n3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:55.320\n Is it the length?\n\n3:35:55.320 --> 3:35:56.880\n Is it the depth of the ideas\n\n3:35:56.880 --> 3:35:58.880\n or how long it takes to integrate them?\n\n3:35:58.880 --> 3:36:01.720\n And more sort of importantly,\n\n3:36:01.720 --> 3:36:04.200\n is there recommendation advice you can give\n\n3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:09.200\n on how to integrate these ideas,\n\n3:36:09.480 --> 3:36:13.840\n how to read, how to learn in the spaces there\n\n3:36:13.840 --> 3:36:15.200\n from your own life?\n\n3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:17.000\n Like how do you enjoy taking in ideas?\n\n3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:18.160\n And this could be for these books,\n\n3:36:18.160 --> 3:36:21.120\n but also in the Bitcoin world\n\n3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:24.520\n and reading a bunch of different ideas written by others,\n\n3:36:24.520 --> 3:36:28.200\n just integrating stuff, even watching podcasts\n\n3:36:28.200 --> 3:36:29.680\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:36:29.680 --> 3:36:31.440\n Yeah, I'm a reader.\n\n3:36:31.440 --> 3:36:32.520\n I love to read.\n\n3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:35.960\n One of the most useful things I've ever done\n\n3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:37.680\n was take a speed reading course.\n\n3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:40.120\n I actually think there's a version of this\n\n3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:41.640\n available on Tim Ferriss's website.\n\n3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:44.280\n It's like a 30 minute speed reading course.\n\n3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:45.760\n It's all about eye movement.\n\n3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:48.600\n Instead of moving your eye continuously line over line,\n\n3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:50.600\n it's more about jumping in your brain.\n\n3:36:50.600 --> 3:36:53.560\n You can train your brain to just absorb words\n\n3:36:53.560 --> 3:36:56.960\n in their totality versus kind of reading word by word.\n\n3:36:56.960 --> 3:37:00.800\n And also not, I haven't fully taken that journey actually,\n\n3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:05.400\n but I remember taking a few steps on that journey,\n\n3:37:05.400 --> 3:37:08.640\n realizing that I'm speaking inside my head.\n\n3:37:08.640 --> 3:37:09.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:10.840\n I'm saying the words inside my head\n\n3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:12.200\n and that's actually getting in the way.\n\n3:37:12.200 --> 3:37:13.040\n That's right.\n\n3:37:13.040 --> 3:37:15.080\n So there's a lot of little hacks like that.\n\n3:37:15.080 --> 3:37:17.880\n I maybe lazily, now that you mentioned,\n\n3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:19.320\n I'll have to revisit this.\n\n3:37:19.320 --> 3:37:23.720\n But I have convinced myself that I don't need to read faster\n\n3:37:23.720 --> 3:37:25.440\n because that's not ultimately the bottleneck.\n\n3:37:25.440 --> 3:37:28.360\n The bottleneck is in me thinking about stuff.\n\n3:37:28.360 --> 3:37:30.440\n In fact, I like reading really slowly\n\n3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:31.920\n or so I convinced myself.\n\n3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:35.520\n Because ultimately it's not about gaining more information.\n\n3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:38.680\n It's about time spent thinking deeply.\n\n3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:40.280\n Yes, yes.\n\n3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:43.280\n But maybe that's just me being very lazy\n\n3:37:43.280 --> 3:37:44.200\n because yes, it's true.\n\n3:37:44.200 --> 3:37:45.480\n It's important to think deeply,\n\n3:37:45.480 --> 3:37:49.360\n but maybe I could speed up the consumption of information.\n\n3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:50.440\n It's fine.\n\n3:37:50.440 --> 3:37:51.880\n I like to be dynamic actually.\n\n3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:55.320\n So usually speed reading initially\n\n3:37:55.320 --> 3:37:58.400\n and that diffused that internal dialogue for me\n\n3:37:58.400 --> 3:37:59.720\n because when I was reading one word at a time,\n\n3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:00.560\n I was having that too.\n\n3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:02.080\n You almost get a feedback in your own head\n\n3:38:02.080 --> 3:38:03.240\n when you're reading the word out loud\n\n3:38:03.240 --> 3:38:04.640\n and it's clouding your thoughts.\n\n3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:06.560\n If you're speed reading, you can't do that.\n\n3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:08.640\n You're taking in groups of words at a time\n\n3:38:08.640 --> 3:38:13.080\n so you can't internally verbalize it, I guess.\n\n3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:15.560\n And then I also am really big on annotating,\n\n3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:17.720\n underlining, writing in the margins.\n\n3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:20.000\n I prefer a physical book,\n\n3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:21.400\n but I also read the Kindle a lot\n\n3:38:21.400 --> 3:38:23.120\n because it's just so convenient.\n\n3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:25.440\n Anywhere you're waiting in line or every night before bed,\n\n3:38:25.440 --> 3:38:27.080\n I'm reading my Kindle.\n\n3:38:27.080 --> 3:38:30.120\n And I also advocate rereading a lot.\n\n3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:34.560\n So if you found something that struck you at a deep level\n\n3:38:34.560 --> 3:38:36.080\n or you found particularly fascinating,\n\n3:38:36.080 --> 3:38:37.520\n like you have to listen to that.\n\n3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:41.360\n That's your, I don't know, your mind or your spirit signal\n\n3:38:41.360 --> 3:38:43.520\n that that is something meaningful to you\n\n3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:46.320\n and you should, to your point, reread it,\n\n3:38:46.320 --> 3:38:49.200\n sit with it for a long time, write about it.\n\n3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:52.880\n And that becomes the ultimate triumvirate\n\n3:38:52.880 --> 3:38:55.000\n of synthesizing an idea, actually.\n\n3:38:55.000 --> 3:38:58.400\n If you can read about it and then write about it\n\n3:38:59.440 --> 3:39:01.000\n and then go and talk about it,\n\n3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:03.040\n you get this crystallization of understanding\n\n3:39:03.040 --> 3:39:05.520\n that's just not possible doing any one of the three\n\n3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:06.760\n or any two of the three.\n\n3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:12.560\n So I definitely highly recommend people to do that.\n\n3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:16.280\n And in terms of how are those books difficult?\n\n3:39:16.280 --> 3:39:18.120\n I mean, and if you're reading a lot of books,\n\n3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:19.680\n are difficult, I mean, in every way,\n\n3:39:19.680 --> 3:39:21.200\n they're all long books.\n\n3:39:22.520 --> 3:39:26.600\n In terms of density, I would say Lila is the less,\n\n3:39:26.600 --> 3:39:30.520\n the least dense, maybe Maps of Meaning.\n\n3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:33.280\n I don't know, but Maps of Meaning\n\n3:39:33.280 --> 3:39:35.760\n and Human Action are both extremely dense.\n\n3:39:35.760 --> 3:39:40.160\n But they're just, I had to read those books very slow.\n\n3:39:40.160 --> 3:39:42.600\n That you just have to take your time with them.\n\n3:39:42.600 --> 3:39:44.040\n To give you an idea with Jordan Peterson,\n\n3:39:44.040 --> 3:39:46.920\n he's said this a lot with Maps of Meaning.\n\n3:39:46.920 --> 3:39:50.240\n He spent three hours a day writing for 15 years\n\n3:39:50.240 --> 3:39:51.160\n to write that book.\n\n3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:53.680\n It's probably, I think it's a 600 page book.\n\n3:39:53.680 --> 3:39:55.720\n He said he estimates he rewrote every sentence\n\n3:39:55.720 --> 3:39:58.920\n in the book 50 times, five, zero,\n\n3:39:58.920 --> 3:40:01.840\n to try and get it just perfected.\n\n3:40:01.840 --> 3:40:04.080\n And when you read these sentences,\n\n3:40:05.040 --> 3:40:07.600\n you can tell that he rewrote it 50 times.\n\n3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:12.520\n I've used actually Anki for spaced repetition.\n\n3:40:13.800 --> 3:40:15.560\n It's like a piece of, it's an app.\n\n3:40:15.560 --> 3:40:17.000\n I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,\n\n3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:22.000\n but it allows you to load in facts or terms\n\n3:40:22.040 --> 3:40:24.200\n or entire paragraphs.\n\n3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:29.200\n And then it brings them, you review them every day\n\n3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:33.560\n and then it brings them up less and less often over time\n\n3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:36.160\n as you show yourself being able to remember\n\n3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:39.440\n the thing that you wanted to memorize.\n\n3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:41.320\n And oftentimes when I'm reading,\n\n3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:43.880\n what I want to memorize is the key idea.\n\n3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:47.160\n But also like I use it for, I'm terrible with names.\n\n3:40:47.160 --> 3:40:49.240\n So I'm starting to use it for names too,\n\n3:40:49.240 --> 3:40:52.040\n names of people, names of like people\n\n3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:53.560\n that I want to remember.\n\n3:40:53.560 --> 3:40:56.560\n And also throughout history and also in my own personal life\n\n3:40:56.560 --> 3:40:59.040\n but also events, you know, dates to me\n\n3:40:59.040 --> 3:41:00.200\n are usually not important,\n\n3:41:00.200 --> 3:41:03.040\n but sometimes dates are really important.\n\n3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:04.440\n And so it's really useful.\n\n3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:05.280\n I recommend it highly.\n\n3:41:05.280 --> 3:41:08.680\n Naval, I think mentioned a piece of software\n\n3:41:08.680 --> 3:41:11.560\n called Readwise or something like that,\n\n3:41:11.560 --> 3:41:14.640\n that I hope I'm saying that correctly.\n\n3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:16.280\n It's something like that.\n\n3:41:16.280 --> 3:41:18.920\n And what it does is it goes to your highlights\n\n3:41:18.920 --> 3:41:23.000\n from your Kindle or the various places\n\n3:41:23.000 --> 3:41:27.760\n where you highlight stuff that integrates with Goodreads.\n\n3:41:27.760 --> 3:41:29.960\n And it does the same kind of spaced repetition\n\n3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:31.640\n but for things you've highlighted.\n\n3:41:31.640 --> 3:41:34.760\n So it sends an email every day.\n\n3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:38.360\n It's been really, I recommend it highly\n\n3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:43.360\n because it sends like to me an email form,\n\n3:41:43.440 --> 3:41:45.360\n a selection of the things I've highlighted\n\n3:41:45.360 --> 3:41:47.120\n and previous things I've read.\n\n3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:52.120\n And it's like this weird like shock to your memory\n\n3:41:52.360 --> 3:41:56.760\n that sprinkles like I have probably way too much Orwell\n\n3:41:56.760 --> 3:42:00.240\n in there and it just kind of like, it brings you back.\n\n3:42:00.240 --> 3:42:03.240\n And these ideas are, because what you realize,\n\n3:42:03.240 --> 3:42:07.280\n depending on how you highlight, but at least for me,\n\n3:42:07.280 --> 3:42:08.880\n and I think it's probably true for a lot of people,\n\n3:42:08.880 --> 3:42:11.360\n the things you've highlighted had at that moment\n\n3:42:11.360 --> 3:42:13.840\n and like an emotional impact on you.\n\n3:42:13.840 --> 3:42:16.200\n And so like these things are just like hitting you hard\n\n3:42:16.200 --> 3:42:19.520\n again, it's like, whoa, it might not be meaningful\n\n3:42:19.520 --> 3:42:20.720\n to anyone else except you.\n\n3:42:20.720 --> 3:42:23.240\n And it's something I recommend.\n\n3:42:23.240 --> 3:42:25.760\n You never know with these like hacks or tools and so on,\n\n3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:29.440\n like what's actually BS and what is amazing.\n\n3:42:29.440 --> 3:42:31.360\n And that one is kind of amazing.\n\n3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:34.600\n So at least for me, it works for me and Naval.\n\n3:42:34.600 --> 3:42:35.760\n I think he's the one.\n\n3:42:35.760 --> 3:42:37.920\n Read wise you said. Read wise.\n\n3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:39.920\n Or something close to that.\n\n3:42:39.920 --> 3:42:41.480\n It could be read something else,\n\n3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:43.680\n like read wealth or something.\n\n3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:46.840\n The one other thing I really like,\n\n3:42:46.840 --> 3:42:48.080\n and this is more of a new one,\n\n3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:50.920\n is I used to always listen to music at the gym,\n\n3:42:50.920 --> 3:42:54.280\n but now I've just, because I'm so backlogged on podcasts,\n\n3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:59.160\n right, there's so many, I exclusively listen to podcasts\n\n3:42:59.160 --> 3:43:00.440\n when I'm walking or when I'm at the gym,\n\n3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:03.820\n anytime I'm doing something that I can't read basically.\n\n3:43:03.820 --> 3:43:07.000\n And I think there's something really special\n\n3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:09.340\n about exercise and ideation.\n\n3:43:09.340 --> 3:43:12.360\n I mean, I don't know if this happens to everyone,\n\n3:43:12.360 --> 3:43:14.480\n but my creative juices just go ballistic.\n\n3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:17.520\n When I'm at the gym, like I hit a certain point of,\n\n3:43:17.520 --> 3:43:19.480\n I guess, heart rate and you're sweating enough,\n\n3:43:19.480 --> 3:43:21.760\n then the ideas just start to flow.\n\n3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:25.440\n So I'm basically at the gym now listening to podcasts,\n\n3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:28.980\n exercising as fast as I can to try to get to that state of,\n\n3:43:30.880 --> 3:43:31.880\n you know, where you're just straining,\n\n3:43:31.880 --> 3:43:34.320\n your strenuous exercise, I guess you would say,\n\n3:43:34.320 --> 3:43:36.320\n and then I end up typing notes into my phone\n\n3:43:36.320 --> 3:43:39.160\n as fast as I can with all these ideas that are flowing.\n\n3:43:39.160 --> 3:43:42.520\n So I've created a lot of good writing out of that.\n\n3:43:42.520 --> 3:43:43.560\n Yeah, it's kind of work.\n\n3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:47.900\n So I do running quite a bit, so running outside,\n\n3:43:47.900 --> 3:43:51.520\n and I'll listen to, I've been, okay,\n\n3:43:51.520 --> 3:43:55.000\n I told myself this has been going on for about a year,\n\n3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:00.000\n is I only listen, like the stuff that's either World War II\n\n3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:01.840\n or World War I related.\n\n3:44:01.840 --> 3:44:06.840\n So Hitler, Stalin, like difficult historical stuff.\n\n3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:13.160\n And also listen to brown noise.\n\n3:44:13.160 --> 3:44:14.480\n So those are the two modes.\n\n3:44:14.480 --> 3:44:18.420\n So brown noise helps me, this is like white noise,\n\n3:44:18.420 --> 3:44:22.560\n but like deeper, I guess, it helps me remove the world.\n\n3:44:22.560 --> 3:44:24.840\n And at the gym, there's a lot of distractions.\n\n3:44:24.840 --> 3:44:26.600\n When you're running, there's a lot of distractions.\n\n3:44:26.600 --> 3:44:27.680\n It helps me remove the world.\n\n3:44:27.680 --> 3:44:32.400\n So one, I'll be listening to difficult historical ideas.\n\n3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:34.240\n And then when my mind is all of a sudden\n\n3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:36.480\n starting to generate ideas,\n\n3:44:36.480 --> 3:44:40.080\n I'll listen to brown noise and then force myself to think.\n\n3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:44.400\n It's kind of, it's meditative in a sense,\n\n3:44:44.400 --> 3:44:46.440\n and your mind wants to be lazy.\n\n3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:51.440\n You want to, it's hard, man, like running and thinking\n\n3:44:51.600 --> 3:44:53.720\n in the sense that some of the ideas\n\n3:44:53.720 --> 3:44:56.240\n that come into your head are pretty heavy.\n\n3:44:56.240 --> 3:44:59.600\n It's about your own life, your own demons come in there,\n\n3:44:59.600 --> 3:45:01.600\n but also just difficult ideas\n\n3:45:01.600 --> 3:45:02.920\n that require you thinking through\n\n3:45:02.920 --> 3:45:05.440\n and persevering through that,\n\n3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:07.120\n like not letting yourself get lazy\n\n3:45:07.120 --> 3:45:10.480\n and thinking through it has been really for me rewarding\n\n3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:13.920\n in the same way that you're saying it is for you.\n\n3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:16.840\n It's true that like podcasts and music,\n\n3:45:16.840 --> 3:45:20.920\n like shallow, like funny podcasts or music\n\n3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:23.360\n have been a kind of filler distraction.\n\n3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:27.000\n But informational podcasts, like podcasts\n\n3:45:27.000 --> 3:45:30.920\n that have some depths of ideas or audio books\n\n3:45:30.920 --> 3:45:32.600\n have been truly rewarding.\n\n3:45:32.600 --> 3:45:34.960\n I try to listen now less and less to podcasts\n\n3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:35.880\n that are just fun,\n\n3:45:37.760 --> 3:45:39.600\n because I feel like I enjoy it too much\n\n3:45:39.600 --> 3:45:41.840\n and I don't allow my mind to get bored\n\n3:45:41.840 --> 3:45:45.000\n and to think through stuff, to explore ideas.\n\n3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:48.200\n It's so easy to fill the space\n\n3:45:49.240 --> 3:45:52.680\n that usually would be filled with thought\n\n3:45:52.680 --> 3:45:55.680\n and instead fill it with fun podcasts.\n\n3:45:55.680 --> 3:45:58.280\n Like there's a bunch of comedy podcasts I really enjoy.\n\n3:45:58.280 --> 3:46:00.240\n So there's value to that, of course,\n\n3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:02.200\n but you have to realize it's entertainment.\n\n3:46:02.200 --> 3:46:07.200\n It's not, you don't get much value except entertainment.\n\n3:46:07.280 --> 3:46:08.120\n Right, right.\n\n3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:10.800\n And there's utility to the boredom too, I think,\n\n3:46:10.800 --> 3:46:15.360\n where to give your mind the space,\n\n3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:16.440\n I guess your subconscious,\n\n3:46:16.440 --> 3:46:19.080\n maybe the space to chew on some of these problems, right?\n\n3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:21.960\n Where you've imbibed so much knowledge,\n\n3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:23.400\n you've highlighted and thought about something,\n\n3:46:23.400 --> 3:46:25.720\n but then you need to stop thinking about it for a while\n\n3:46:25.720 --> 3:46:27.920\n and let it marinate in the subconscious.\n\n3:46:27.920 --> 3:46:30.880\n And then these flashes of insight\n\n3:46:30.880 --> 3:46:32.080\n that people have described,\n\n3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:33.440\n sometimes I get them in the middle of the night,\n\n3:46:33.440 --> 3:46:35.040\n like I just wake up from a dream and have them\n\n3:46:35.040 --> 3:46:35.880\n and I got to write it down\n\n3:46:35.880 --> 3:46:38.760\n or sometimes just in nature taking a walk.\n\n3:46:38.760 --> 3:46:40.440\n But I think that's very important too.\n\n3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:44.040\n We can't just brute force our way into understanding.\n\n3:46:44.040 --> 3:46:46.040\n There's this interplay between\n\n3:46:46.040 --> 3:46:47.680\n kind of the brute force reading intake\n\n3:46:47.680 --> 3:46:52.280\n and then just relaxing, meditating, sleeping, being bored,\n\n3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:56.120\n letting your subconscious do the heavy lifting.\n\n3:46:56.120 --> 3:46:59.200\n And there's, you should be aware of the fact\n\n3:46:59.200 --> 3:47:01.120\n that there's a war for your attention going on.\n\n3:47:01.120 --> 3:47:02.720\n So there's a lot of,\n\n3:47:02.720 --> 3:47:05.520\n there's been better and better and better mechanisms\n\n3:47:05.520 --> 3:47:08.480\n that are designed to steal your attention.\n\n3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:10.840\n So I kind of see it as a war zone\n\n3:47:10.840 --> 3:47:14.080\n between my right for boredom\n\n3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:17.240\n and the internet wanting your attention.\n\n3:47:17.240 --> 3:47:21.960\n In fact, Clubhouse as an app has been,\n\n3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:24.560\n I'm probably not gonna use Clubhouse much anymore.\n\n3:47:24.560 --> 3:47:27.760\n There's some aspect of my own inner loneliness\n\n3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:31.120\n and whatever it is that pulled me into Clubhouse\n\n3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:33.480\n a little bit too much to where it robbed me\n\n3:47:33.480 --> 3:47:36.400\n from that lonely time alone\n\n3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:38.080\n where I sit and listen to Bruce Springsteen\n\n3:47:38.080 --> 3:47:39.640\n and think about life, right?\n\n3:47:39.640 --> 3:47:40.640\n So I wanna.\n\n3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:41.680\n That's way more important.\n\n3:47:41.680 --> 3:47:44.520\n That's way, well yeah, at least it's all in balance\n\n3:47:44.520 --> 3:47:47.200\n because there is a Clubhouse like a lot\n\n3:47:47.200 --> 3:47:48.760\n of these social networks when you use right\n\n3:47:48.760 --> 3:47:52.120\n can be a way to discover new ideas, new people.\n\n3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:55.160\n But the boredom is just being alone\n\n3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:57.320\n with your thoughts is priceless.\n\n3:47:57.320 --> 3:47:58.160\n Absolutely.\n\n3:47:58.160 --> 3:47:59.520\n And you gotta know yourself, right?\n\n3:47:59.520 --> 3:48:03.200\n Like it took me a long time to realize I need solitude.\n\n3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:05.320\n Like just how I'm wired, how I'm built.\n\n3:48:05.320 --> 3:48:07.400\n I need like an hour a day solitude.\n\n3:48:07.400 --> 3:48:08.860\n So you gotta listen to that part of yourself.\n\n3:48:08.860 --> 3:48:11.740\n You might be compromising something like that\n\n3:48:11.740 --> 3:48:12.960\n where you feel like you always need to be\n\n3:48:12.960 --> 3:48:14.560\n with your girlfriend or whatever it may be.\n\n3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:18.120\n But I would suggest listening to that voice.\n\n3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:20.840\n Yeah, I try to, I tried to remember things\n\n3:48:20.840 --> 3:48:23.020\n that made me feel good over time.\n\n3:48:23.020 --> 3:48:25.400\n Like longterm had positive impact\n\n3:48:25.400 --> 3:48:27.680\n and longterm had negative impact\n\n3:48:27.680 --> 3:48:31.120\n and do more of the former and less of the latter.\n\n3:48:31.120 --> 3:48:33.160\n We don't often think like that.\n\n3:48:33.160 --> 3:48:35.560\n You know, we talked offline about like carnivore diets\n\n3:48:35.560 --> 3:48:38.880\n for example, I try to remember\n\n3:48:38.880 --> 3:48:40.720\n that carbs don't make me feel good.\n\n3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:41.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:43.520\n In the moment it's hard to remember that.\n\n3:48:43.520 --> 3:48:45.000\n It's hard, it's hard.\n\n3:48:45.000 --> 3:48:47.920\n But you have to remember that that's the case.\n\n3:48:47.920 --> 3:48:51.880\n And in the same way, exercise,\n\n3:48:51.880 --> 3:48:54.900\n it's hard to remember that exercise makes me feel good.\n\n3:48:56.160 --> 3:48:58.000\n Like especially when it's time to go to the gym, right?\n\n3:48:58.000 --> 3:48:59.360\n Especially when it's time to go to the gym.\n\n3:48:59.360 --> 3:49:00.560\n But you should remember that\n\n3:49:00.560 --> 3:49:03.840\n because the kind of person you are without exercise,\n\n3:49:03.840 --> 3:49:06.360\n for me, just like you beautifully said\n\n3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:07.400\n that you have to know yourself.\n\n3:49:07.400 --> 3:49:10.560\n The kind of person I am without exercise\n\n3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:15.560\n is a less good person, a person I'm less proud of.\n\n3:49:15.640 --> 3:49:16.920\n The food thing is so hard.\n\n3:49:16.920 --> 3:49:19.840\n By the way, I still, you know,\n\n3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:21.840\n I can't tell you how many times I've learned the lesson,\n\n3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:23.520\n like don't eat that.\n\n3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:25.160\n But then, you know, you go a few weeks\n\n3:49:25.160 --> 3:49:26.960\n of not eating whatever that is,\n\n3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:28.280\n and you're feeling good.\n\n3:49:28.280 --> 3:49:29.840\n And then you're, I don't know,\n\n3:49:29.840 --> 3:49:30.880\n something creeps up inside you.\n\n3:49:30.880 --> 3:49:33.080\n Like, ah, you could just have one or you could just do this.\n\n3:49:33.080 --> 3:49:34.160\n But for me, it's sugar.\n\n3:49:34.160 --> 3:49:36.880\n Like sugar just makes me feel terrible.\n\n3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:40.040\n But I always, not always, but if it's been a long time,\n\n3:49:40.040 --> 3:49:41.560\n I start to make that exception in my mind.\n\n3:49:41.560 --> 3:49:43.000\n Like, oh, you can have a little bit.\n\n3:49:43.000 --> 3:49:44.120\n And then I eat it and I feel terrible.\n\n3:49:44.120 --> 3:49:45.880\n So I don't know how many times I've done that dance,\n\n3:49:45.880 --> 3:49:47.400\n but it's not cool.\n\n3:49:47.400 --> 3:49:48.760\n Well, it depends on how painful it is\n\n3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:49.960\n and then you learn the lesson.\n\n3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:51.800\n I actually embraced the fact\n\n3:49:51.800 --> 3:49:54.560\n that I'll never learn the lesson with vodka.\n\n3:49:54.560 --> 3:49:57.720\n Every time I drink, especially with Russians,\n\n3:49:57.720 --> 3:50:00.280\n is like, I quit drinking every time.\n\n3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:02.880\n And then I forget, there's like a slow drop off.\n\n3:50:02.880 --> 3:50:05.000\n It'll be like two weeks and then.\n\n3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:05.840\n Na zdorovie.\n\n3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:08.560\n Na zdorovie, very good.\n\n3:50:08.560 --> 3:50:12.040\n So it never makes you feel good.\n\n3:50:12.040 --> 3:50:13.800\n It never results in anything good\n\n3:50:15.200 --> 3:50:20.040\n except the beautiful social chaos,\n\n3:50:20.040 --> 3:50:24.680\n which is ultimately somehow, there's value to chaos too.\n\n3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:25.720\n There's value to that.\n\n3:50:25.720 --> 3:50:29.120\n Whatever the hell stupid stuff you do when you get trashed.\n\n3:50:29.120 --> 3:50:32.840\n The over the top emotion of love usually\n\n3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:36.160\n or whatever camaraderie, there's value to that too.\n\n3:50:36.160 --> 3:50:39.600\n Like as I get older, I realize,\n\n3:50:39.600 --> 3:50:43.040\n because the world,\n\n3:50:43.040 --> 3:50:44.400\n sometimes especially when you get older\n\n3:50:44.400 --> 3:50:46.360\n and the world wants you to be an adult,\n\n3:50:47.520 --> 3:50:49.440\n in order to maintain the youthful spirit,\n\n3:50:49.440 --> 3:50:51.720\n you have to use all the tools you can.\n\n3:50:51.720 --> 3:50:53.680\n Alcohol is one of them.\n\n3:50:53.680 --> 3:50:55.480\n To do all the stupid shit you can,\n\n3:50:55.480 --> 3:50:57.920\n even if you're like getting older.\n\n3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:00.000\n To lower the inhibitions.\n\n3:51:00.000 --> 3:51:01.920\n Again, it's that taste of uncertainty\n\n3:51:01.920 --> 3:51:03.440\n that is the sweetness of life, right?\n\n3:51:03.440 --> 3:51:06.520\n To be able to go out and be a flaneur at a party\n\n3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:08.160\n and not really know what you're gonna do.\n\n3:51:08.160 --> 3:51:12.800\n And we have this draw to the wild side of life.\n\n3:51:12.800 --> 3:51:15.400\n As much as we try and build up order around ourselves,\n\n3:51:15.400 --> 3:51:18.560\n I think there's always gonna be an appetite for that.\n\n3:51:18.560 --> 3:51:21.080\n I've always, most of my life,\n\n3:51:21.080 --> 3:51:23.000\n I've always been a social drinker,\n\n3:51:23.000 --> 3:51:25.280\n but I actually gave up alcohol a year ago.\n\n3:51:25.280 --> 3:51:29.360\n And I would add that to the idea,\n\n3:51:30.880 --> 3:51:33.160\n the repertoire for dealing with bigger ideas\n\n3:51:33.160 --> 3:51:37.720\n because alcohol is fun, it's amazing, good times.\n\n3:51:39.240 --> 3:51:42.320\n It can be analgesic, it can give you all these benefits\n\n3:51:42.320 --> 3:51:43.880\n if you use the right amounts.\n\n3:51:43.880 --> 3:51:46.520\n But I got to the point personally\n\n3:51:46.520 --> 3:51:48.400\n where I was trying to wrestle with these ideas\n\n3:51:48.400 --> 3:51:50.280\n that are just so much bigger than me.\n\n3:51:50.280 --> 3:51:52.400\n And I have this backlog of books\n\n3:51:52.400 --> 3:51:55.160\n that was growing faster than I could read them\n\n3:51:55.160 --> 3:51:57.320\n that I just reached a point where I decided\n\n3:51:58.400 --> 3:52:01.520\n I wanted to start making sacrifices toward attaining that.\n\n3:52:01.520 --> 3:52:03.680\n And alcohol was just an easy one.\n\n3:52:03.680 --> 3:52:04.800\n It's you spend,\n\n3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:08.160\n even if you just drink socially on the weekends,\n\n3:52:08.160 --> 3:52:12.280\n you're probably spending five to 10 hours drinking\n\n3:52:12.280 --> 3:52:13.560\n and then maybe another, what?\n\n3:52:13.560 --> 3:52:17.120\n Five to 10 hours recovering perhaps on the day after.\n\n3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:23.000\n So it was a difficult transition initially,\n\n3:52:23.000 --> 3:52:25.880\n but once you get through a couple of months,\n\n3:52:25.880 --> 3:52:27.200\n I feel amazing without it.\n\n3:52:27.200 --> 3:52:28.760\n I sleep better than ever.\n\n3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:30.680\n My workouts are better than ever.\n\n3:52:30.680 --> 3:52:31.640\n I'm sharper than ever.\n\n3:52:31.640 --> 3:52:33.040\n I'm more lucid.\n\n3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:35.840\n So I'm not trying to be a proponent for not drinking,\n\n3:52:35.840 --> 3:52:36.680\n but I just want to say.\n\n3:52:36.680 --> 3:52:38.200\n But you're a proponent for sacrifice.\n\n3:52:38.200 --> 3:52:40.840\n I am a big proponent for sacrifice, yes.\n\n3:52:40.840 --> 3:52:43.680\n Is there advice you would give to a young person today\n\n3:52:43.680 --> 3:52:45.280\n curious about Bitcoin,\n\n3:52:45.280 --> 3:52:49.400\n curious about how they succeed in the world\n\n3:52:50.560 --> 3:52:55.440\n or both career wise and just in life in general?\n\n3:52:55.440 --> 3:52:58.360\n I mean, the strongest piece of advice I have for,\n\n3:52:58.360 --> 3:53:01.120\n this is beyond just Bitcoin.\n\n3:53:01.120 --> 3:53:05.920\n This is you managing your own personal and financial affairs\n\n3:53:05.920 --> 3:53:09.920\n is that you need to invest in knowledge first.\n\n3:53:11.640 --> 3:53:15.720\n It's not good enough to just follow the crowd\n\n3:53:15.720 --> 3:53:20.040\n and buy a 60, 40 portfolio and put it in a Roth RA\n\n3:53:20.040 --> 3:53:22.120\n and plan on social security.\n\n3:53:22.120 --> 3:53:25.640\n I mean, the world's changing much faster\n\n3:53:25.640 --> 3:53:28.920\n than any existing institution\n\n3:53:28.920 --> 3:53:31.160\n is going to be able to keep up with.\n\n3:53:31.160 --> 3:53:33.400\n So that's why I like,\n\n3:53:33.400 --> 3:53:34.600\n I mean, that's why I named the show,\n\n3:53:34.600 --> 3:53:35.600\n the question, what is money?\n\n3:53:35.600 --> 3:53:38.960\n Like, I think that to me is the rabbit\n\n3:53:38.960 --> 3:53:40.240\n that took me down the rabbit holes.\n\n3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:43.880\n Like just asking that question naturally progressed\n\n3:53:43.880 --> 3:53:45.040\n to these other questions.\n\n3:53:45.040 --> 3:53:46.160\n Like what is value?\n\n3:53:46.160 --> 3:53:47.160\n What is government?\n\n3:53:47.160 --> 3:53:50.320\n What is the purpose of society?\n\n3:53:50.320 --> 3:53:52.360\n Speech, all of these things.\n\n3:53:52.360 --> 3:53:57.360\n So I would encourage people to arm yourself\n\n3:53:57.480 --> 3:53:58.600\n with knowledge and study.\n\n3:53:58.600 --> 3:54:01.600\n And like that, a lot of financial people\n\n3:54:01.600 --> 3:54:04.200\n always give you a line of advice\n\n3:54:04.200 --> 3:54:06.000\n and then say, this is not financial advice.\n\n3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:07.600\n I'm like, this is financial advice.\n\n3:54:07.600 --> 3:54:10.520\n Like study, study, learn.\n\n3:54:12.040 --> 3:54:13.200\n Knowledge is power.\n\n3:54:13.200 --> 3:54:14.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:54:14.040 --> 3:54:16.040\n This is official financial advice.\n\n3:54:16.040 --> 3:54:19.120\n And you're exercising your divine trait,\n\n3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:22.320\n which is the logos, right?\n\n3:54:22.320 --> 3:54:24.920\n That we are these animals\n\n3:54:24.920 --> 3:54:26.440\n that can tell and believe stories.\n\n3:54:26.440 --> 3:54:28.960\n So it feels like almost a sacred duty\n\n3:54:28.960 --> 3:54:31.680\n to really sharpen that part of ourselves\n\n3:54:31.680 --> 3:54:34.160\n and use it to create the best world possible.\n\n3:54:36.960 --> 3:54:39.000\n And then the second one was the,\n\n3:54:39.000 --> 3:54:40.560\n I think health and fitness stuff.\n\n3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:45.560\n I was, maybe everyone does this in their 20s.\n\n3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:49.440\n They just live a little fast and beat themselves up.\n\n3:54:49.440 --> 3:54:54.120\n Not that I wasn't, like I was living well\n\n3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:58.280\n and successful by a lot of measures,\n\n3:54:58.280 --> 3:55:00.360\n but I wish I had maybe got my act together\n\n3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:01.360\n a little bit sooner.\n\n3:55:04.400 --> 3:55:05.240\n I just think.\n\n3:55:05.240 --> 3:55:07.480\n Health wise, morality wise.\n\n3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:11.320\n Yeah, drinking, I think morality and eating.\n\n3:55:11.320 --> 3:55:14.840\n I just was kind of doing whatever I wanted in some ways.\n\n3:55:14.840 --> 3:55:15.680\n Let's say.\n\n3:55:16.520 --> 3:55:18.000\n Is there a value to a trajectory\n\n3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:19.880\n that includes a lot of mistakes?\n\n3:55:19.880 --> 3:55:22.520\n So maybe you're supposed to make the mistakes in your 20s.\n\n3:55:22.520 --> 3:55:23.360\n That's a great point.\n\n3:55:23.360 --> 3:55:25.480\n Maybe the 20s are all about the mistakes.\n\n3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:27.000\n Accumulate the most mistakes possible.\n\n3:55:27.000 --> 3:55:28.000\n Yeah, I don't.\n\n3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:30.640\n As quickly as possible.\n\n3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:32.240\n I don't regret any of it,\n\n3:55:32.240 --> 3:55:35.600\n but now that I'm kind of in this place where I feel good\n\n3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:37.680\n and I know the value of a good night's sleep\n\n3:55:37.680 --> 3:55:42.240\n and just, I've more deeply explored my own potential\n\n3:55:42.240 --> 3:55:44.120\n that I feel maybe a little regretful\n\n3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:46.160\n that I didn't do this earlier is all I'm saying.\n\n3:55:46.160 --> 3:55:50.560\n So maybe just exploring different sides of yourself.\n\n3:55:50.560 --> 3:55:52.640\n See what it's like to go and make a bunch of mistakes\n\n3:55:52.640 --> 3:55:53.920\n and be wild and crazy\n\n3:55:53.920 --> 3:55:55.360\n and then maybe try to walk the straight and narrow\n\n3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:58.360\n for a few months and just see what it's like.\n\n3:55:58.360 --> 3:56:02.120\n There's probably a guy doing vodka shots right now\n\n3:56:02.120 --> 3:56:03.960\n listening to this podcast with his buddies\n\n3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:07.520\n and if you are, please take a shot for us\n\n3:56:07.520 --> 3:56:11.240\n for all the mistakes you should make in your 20s.\n\n3:56:11.240 --> 3:56:15.600\n And what about love?\n\n3:56:18.000 --> 3:56:21.880\n We talked about money is ultimately a mechanism\n\n3:56:21.880 --> 3:56:26.880\n by which you can pave a moral path through life.\n\n3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:31.720\n To me, one of the purest expressions\n\n3:56:31.720 --> 3:56:36.080\n that is love broadly defined for a family, for others,\n\n3:56:36.080 --> 3:56:38.080\n for knowledge, for the world,\n\n3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:40.840\n is basically an optimistic open view to the world\n\n3:56:40.840 --> 3:56:44.800\n that embraces all that is beautiful about this world.\n\n3:56:44.800 --> 3:56:49.800\n So do you think about love often in a personal sense,\n\n3:56:51.200 --> 3:56:54.920\n romantic, family, friendship, and in the broad sense\n\n3:56:54.920 --> 3:56:58.400\n about its value in a successful life?\n\n3:56:59.920 --> 3:57:01.440\n Yeah, of course.\n\n3:57:01.440 --> 3:57:04.600\n I'm blessed to have a two and a half year old daughter\n\n3:57:04.600 --> 3:57:09.160\n and love is a word we throw around.\n\n3:57:09.160 --> 3:57:11.400\n I love these potato chips, I love you, man.\n\n3:57:11.400 --> 3:57:12.760\n I love you, my daughter.\n\n3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:15.560\n It's got so many different intensities,\n\n3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:16.600\n I guess you might say.\n\n3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:21.920\n I don't know, my intuition is that\n\n3:57:23.480 --> 3:57:27.200\n it is something very fundamental to the universe.\n\n3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:29.120\n Again, I know words don't do it justice,\n\n3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:33.280\n but if we just proxy love with selfless action,\n\n3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:38.400\n the whole damn universe is selflessly acting, right?\n\n3:57:38.400 --> 3:57:43.400\n It's just unfolding and it may sound a bit hippy dippy,\n\n3:57:43.760 --> 3:57:45.160\n but my intuition is just that love\n\n3:57:45.160 --> 3:57:47.520\n is the core of it somehow.\n\n3:57:48.920 --> 3:57:51.920\n I don't have anything to back that up really, it's just.\n\n3:57:51.920 --> 3:57:55.160\n In the way you're framing it, it's making me think\n\n3:57:55.160 --> 3:58:00.040\n that love, we talked about sort of meditation,\n\n3:58:00.040 --> 3:58:05.040\n is as opposed to thinking from an egocentric perspective\n\n3:58:05.680 --> 3:58:08.280\n of you, the individual operating in this world,\n\n3:58:08.280 --> 3:58:10.960\n is allowing you to be empathetic towards the world\n\n3:58:10.960 --> 3:58:13.440\n and thereby think of the universe,\n\n3:58:13.440 --> 3:58:15.840\n think of the world acting through you.\n\n3:58:15.840 --> 3:58:20.680\n Almost like accepting this notion that ideas have you,\n\n3:58:20.680 --> 3:58:21.800\n you don't have ideas,\n\n3:58:22.840 --> 3:58:25.240\n that you're not existing in the universe,\n\n3:58:25.240 --> 3:58:27.240\n the universe is existing through you.\n\n3:58:27.240 --> 3:58:32.240\n It's sort of like, that's what selfless in that context means\n\n3:58:32.400 --> 3:58:34.600\n is like embracing that thought.\n\n3:58:34.600 --> 3:58:36.560\n That's a weird thought.\n\n3:58:36.560 --> 3:58:38.640\n It's a weird thought that we're just here for a little bit\n\n3:58:38.640 --> 3:58:43.640\n of time, these meat vehicles, receptacles,\n\n3:58:45.120 --> 3:58:50.120\n and this much bigger thing is just using us,\n\n3:58:51.560 --> 3:58:55.960\n not in a malevolent way, but just like a river flows,\n\n3:58:55.960 --> 3:58:59.160\n is using us to create more and more beautiful things.\n\n3:58:59.160 --> 3:59:01.920\n Yes, yes, more and more beautiful things.\n\n3:59:01.920 --> 3:59:06.120\n We are the universe experiencing itself, frankly, right?\n\n3:59:06.120 --> 3:59:06.960\n So.\n\n3:59:06.960 --> 3:59:08.160\n That's a trippy thought, man.\n\n3:59:08.160 --> 3:59:09.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:59:09.480 --> 3:59:12.200\n That in some sense the universe created us\n\n3:59:12.200 --> 3:59:13.800\n to experience itself.\n\n3:59:13.800 --> 3:59:17.800\n And we are one of the highest forms of beauty\n\n3:59:17.800 --> 3:59:19.280\n that nature has created, right?\n\n3:59:19.280 --> 3:59:23.320\n If we just think one of the most complex\n\n3:59:23.320 --> 3:59:26.640\n and adaptive thing, we're a reflection of nature.\n\n3:59:26.640 --> 3:59:30.440\n And another thing that comes to mind here is that\n\n3:59:30.440 --> 3:59:35.440\n Dalio has this quote where he says, truth or more accurately,\n\n3:59:36.360 --> 3:59:39.600\n an accurate depiction of reality is necessary\n\n3:59:39.600 --> 3:59:41.200\n for any good outcome.\n\n3:59:42.400 --> 3:59:47.400\n So when we think that love or value is primary,\n\n3:59:47.400 --> 3:59:49.880\n I think that too reinforces this thesis\n\n3:59:49.880 --> 3:59:54.840\n that acting out of love or acting out of proper moral action,\n\n3:59:54.840 --> 3:59:58.320\n you're best reflecting the fundamental nature of reality.\n\n3:59:58.320 --> 4:00:01.040\n Therefore, you're best creating the best possible outcomes\n\n4:00:01.040 --> 4:00:02.200\n or the things of the most beauty,\n\n4:00:02.200 --> 4:00:03.920\n whether that's your artistic expression,\n\n4:00:03.920 --> 4:00:06.480\n your children, your business, whatever it is.\n\n4:00:07.960 --> 4:00:09.640\n And Jordan Peterson goes deep into that\n\n4:00:09.640 --> 4:00:12.640\n where you have to listen to that sense of meaning\n\n4:00:12.640 --> 4:00:13.640\n in your life.\n\n4:00:13.640 --> 4:00:15.280\n Or you might have some decision on paper\n\n4:00:15.280 --> 4:00:18.280\n that's so great this way, but your heart says no,\n\n4:00:18.280 --> 4:00:19.600\n your heart says otherwise.\n\n4:00:22.040 --> 4:00:24.160\n I've tried to listen to my heart throughout\n\n4:00:24.160 --> 4:00:26.440\n and I think that creates the best outcomes.\n\n4:00:26.440 --> 4:00:30.240\n But nevertheless, does it make you sad\n\n4:00:30.240 --> 4:00:34.400\n that you in particular, Robert,\n\n4:00:34.400 --> 4:00:36.080\n are gonna be dead pretty soon?\n\n4:00:38.160 --> 4:00:42.280\n As we talk about scarcity, one of the certain things\n\n4:00:42.280 --> 4:00:45.920\n that ensure the scarcity of the human experience\n\n4:00:45.920 --> 4:00:48.440\n is the fact that you and your consciousness\n\n4:00:48.440 --> 4:00:51.480\n are gonna be done, they have a deadline.\n\n4:00:51.480 --> 4:00:54.320\n Only time and Bitcoin are absolutely scarce.\n\n4:00:54.320 --> 4:00:59.320\n I'm fortunate, I guess I got started\n\n4:01:03.200 --> 4:01:05.480\n on this philosophical journey a bit when I was younger,\n\n4:01:05.480 --> 4:01:09.840\n but I got into Musashi and Sun Tzu quite a bit,\n\n4:01:11.280 --> 4:01:13.800\n who wrote, Musashi wrote the Book of Five Rings,\n\n4:01:16.160 --> 4:01:17.400\n Sun Tzu wrote The Art of War.\n\n4:01:17.400 --> 4:01:19.880\n And one of the things that, I mean,\n\n4:01:19.880 --> 4:01:22.880\n these guys were just absolute beasts.\n\n4:01:22.880 --> 4:01:24.440\n They lived and died by the sword\n\n4:01:24.440 --> 4:01:28.880\n and they were just very great equanimity\n\n4:01:28.880 --> 4:01:30.240\n about all things in life.\n\n4:01:30.240 --> 4:01:32.880\n And I also found this kind of in the stoic philosophy\n\n4:01:32.880 --> 4:01:37.440\n where they just are very cool with everything.\n\n4:01:37.440 --> 4:01:40.560\n And one of the lines there is that the way of the warrior\n\n4:01:40.560 --> 4:01:42.440\n is the resolute acceptance of death.\n\n4:01:43.560 --> 4:01:45.120\n And so I've always tried to think about that.\n\n4:01:45.120 --> 4:01:46.920\n Like, of course I experienced fear,\n\n4:01:46.920 --> 4:01:51.800\n I experienced everything that you do on a meat suit, right?\n\n4:01:51.800 --> 4:01:53.280\n Like anxiety and all the things,\n\n4:01:53.280 --> 4:01:58.280\n but I always try to have that higher order view of myself\n\n4:01:58.320 --> 4:02:02.640\n and that it's just a certain experience occurring\n\n4:02:02.640 --> 4:02:03.680\n at a certain level,\n\n4:02:03.680 --> 4:02:06.960\n but it shouldn't override your kind of highest order self.\n\n4:02:06.960 --> 4:02:09.720\n That's just resolutely accepted death\n\n4:02:09.720 --> 4:02:13.520\n and that this is your one play in life.\n\n4:02:13.520 --> 4:02:18.520\n So hopefully that propels me towards proper action.\n\n4:02:18.520 --> 4:02:23.520\n I think scarcity cannot help, but lead to something good.\n\n4:02:25.040 --> 4:02:26.760\n Just like with this conversation,\n\n4:02:26.760 --> 4:02:29.280\n sadly must come to an end.\n\n4:02:29.280 --> 4:02:31.400\n The scarcity of it is what makes it beautiful.\n\n4:02:31.400 --> 4:02:34.880\n So Robert, this was one of my favorite conversations\n\n4:02:35.920 --> 4:02:40.040\n philosophically and in every other level,\n\n4:02:40.040 --> 4:02:44.360\n just the ideas and the way you express them around Bitcoin,\n\n4:02:44.360 --> 4:02:47.100\n around morality, around money.\n\n4:02:47.100 --> 4:02:51.260\n Has been really inspiring and really educational.\n\n4:02:51.260 --> 4:02:54.120\n And I'm glad you're out there fighting the good fight.\n\n4:02:54.120 --> 4:02:57.020\n And I'm glad you're wasting all of this time with me.\n\n4:02:57.020 --> 4:02:58.340\n It was really fun.\n\n4:02:58.340 --> 4:03:01.680\n And thank you for coming down to Texas\n\n4:03:01.680 --> 4:03:05.020\n and having some good old brisket together.\n\n4:03:05.020 --> 4:03:06.580\n This was really fun, man.\n\n4:03:06.580 --> 4:03:07.920\n This was awesome.\n\n4:03:07.920 --> 4:03:09.980\n Thanks for having me, man.\n\n4:03:09.980 --> 4:03:11.660\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n4:03:11.660 --> 4:03:13.060\n with Robert Breedlove.\n\n4:03:13.060 --> 4:03:18.060\n And thank you to Fundrise, Element, Mugpack, and BetterHelp.\n\n4:03:18.540 --> 4:03:21.980\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n4:03:21.980 --> 4:03:24.060\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n4:03:24.060 --> 4:03:26.420\n from Nassim Nicholas Taleb.\n\n4:03:26.420 --> 4:03:29.940\n \"'Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness.\n\n4:03:29.940 --> 4:03:33.620\n \"'The resilient resists shocks and stay the same.\n\n4:03:33.620 --> 4:03:36.420\n \"'The antifragile gets better.'\"\n\n4:03:36.420 --> 4:03:41.420\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
