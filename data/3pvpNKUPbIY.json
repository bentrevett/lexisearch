So maybe some context.\n\n00:30.480 --> 00:32.800\n You, like we were talking about offline,\n\n00:32.800 --> 00:36.560\n grew up in Massachusetts, learned computer programming there,\n\n00:36.560 --> 00:40.880\n liked to play Doom II, worked at a vinyl record store.\n\n00:40.880 --> 00:45.880\n Then you went to Stanford, turned down Mr. Mark Zuckerberg\n\n00:46.000 --> 00:49.000\n and Facebook, went to Florence to study photography.\n\n00:49.000 --> 00:51.680\n Those are just some random, beautiful,\n\n00:51.680 --> 00:54.780\n impossibly brief glimpses into a life.\n\n00:54.780 --> 00:56.800\n So let me ask again, can you take me through\n\n00:56.800 --> 00:59.280\n the origin story of Instagram, given that context?\n\n00:59.280 --> 01:00.480\n You basically set it up.\n\n01:01.920 --> 01:04.640\n All right, so we have a fair amount of time,\n\n01:04.640 --> 01:05.920\n so I'll go into some detail.\n\n01:05.920 --> 01:07.480\n But basically what I'll say is,\n\n01:09.080 --> 01:13.540\n Instagram started out of a company actually called Bourbon,\n\n01:13.540 --> 01:16.200\n and it was spelled B U R B N.\n\n01:16.200 --> 01:19.080\n And a couple of things were happening at the time.\n\n01:19.080 --> 01:22.560\n So if we zoom back to 2010, not a lot of people remember\n\n01:22.560 --> 01:25.560\n what was happening in the dot com world then,\n\n01:25.560 --> 01:29.440\n but check in apps were all the rage.\n\n01:29.440 --> 01:30.280\n So.\n\n01:30.280 --> 01:31.120\n What's a check in app?\n\n01:31.120 --> 01:34.320\n Gowalla, Foursquare, Hotpotato.\n\n01:34.320 --> 01:36.760\n So I'm at a place, I'm gonna tell the world\n\n01:36.760 --> 01:37.720\n that I'm at this place.\n\n01:37.720 --> 01:38.680\n That's right.\n\n01:38.680 --> 01:41.240\n What's the idea behind this kind of app, by the way?\n\n01:41.240 --> 01:42.760\n You know what, I'm gonna answer that,\n\n01:42.760 --> 01:45.320\n but through what Instagram became\n\n01:45.320 --> 01:48.040\n and why I believe Instagram replaced them.\n\n01:48.040 --> 01:49.800\n So the whole idea was to share with the world\n\n01:49.800 --> 01:52.800\n what you were doing, specifically with your friends, right?\n\n01:53.880 --> 01:54.800\n But there were all the rage,\n\n01:54.800 --> 01:56.360\n and Foursquare was getting all the press.\n\n01:56.360 --> 01:57.800\n And I remember sitting around saying,\n\n01:57.800 --> 01:58.920\n hey, I wanna build something,\n\n01:58.920 --> 02:00.580\n but I don't know what I wanna build.\n\n02:00.580 --> 02:04.320\n What if I built a better version of Foursquare?\n\n02:04.320 --> 02:07.920\n And I asked myself, well, why don't I like Foursquare\n\n02:07.920 --> 02:09.320\n or how could it be improved?\n\n02:10.760 --> 02:13.040\n And basically I sat down and I said,\n\n02:13.040 --> 02:16.560\n I think that if you have a few extra features,\n\n02:16.560 --> 02:17.480\n it might be enough.\n\n02:17.480 --> 02:19.080\n One of which happened to be posting a photo\n\n02:19.080 --> 02:20.320\n of where you were.\n\n02:20.320 --> 02:21.520\n There were some others.\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:23.120\n It turns out that wasn't enough.\n\n02:23.120 --> 02:27.000\n My co founder joined, we were going to attack Foursquare\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.400\n and the likes and try to build something interesting.\n\n02:30.400 --> 02:31.240\n And no one used it.\n\n02:31.240 --> 02:32.600\n No one cared because it wasn't enough.\n\n02:32.600 --> 02:35.720\n It wasn't different enough, right?\n\n02:35.720 --> 02:38.040\n So one day we were sitting down and we asked ourselves,\n\n02:38.040 --> 02:40.880\n okay, it's come to Jesus moment.\n\n02:40.880 --> 02:43.120\n Are we gonna do this startup?\n\n02:43.120 --> 02:44.400\n And if we're going to,\n\n02:44.400 --> 02:46.160\n we can't do what we're currently doing.\n\n02:46.160 --> 02:47.020\n We have to switch it up.\n\n02:47.020 --> 02:48.360\n So what do people love the most?\n\n02:48.360 --> 02:51.760\n So we sat down and we wrote out three things\n\n02:51.760 --> 02:54.640\n that we thought people uniquely loved about our product\n\n02:54.640 --> 02:57.160\n that weren't in other products.\n\n02:57.160 --> 02:59.200\n Photos happened to be the top one.\n\n02:59.200 --> 03:01.380\n So sharing a photo of what you were doing,\n\n03:01.380 --> 03:03.160\n where you were at the moment\n\n03:03.160 --> 03:06.640\n was not something products let you do really.\n\n03:06.640 --> 03:09.480\n Facebook was like, post an album of your vacation\n\n03:09.480 --> 03:11.440\n from two weeks ago, right?\n\n03:11.440 --> 03:13.400\n Twitter allowed you to post a photo,\n\n03:13.400 --> 03:15.560\n but their feed was primarily text\n\n03:15.560 --> 03:17.400\n and they didn't show the photo in line\n\n03:17.400 --> 03:19.720\n or at least I don't think they did at the time.\n\n03:19.720 --> 03:23.520\n So even though it seems totally stupid\n\n03:23.520 --> 03:27.280\n and obvious to us now, at the moment then,\n\n03:27.280 --> 03:29.360\n posting a photo of what you were doing at the moment\n\n03:29.360 --> 03:30.600\n was like not a thing.\n\n03:32.020 --> 03:34.160\n So we decided to go after that\n\n03:34.160 --> 03:36.480\n because we noticed that people who used our service,\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:38.640\n the one thing they happened to like the most\n\n03:38.640 --> 03:40.240\n was posting a photo.\n\n03:40.240 --> 03:41.760\n So that was the beginning of Instagram.\n\n03:41.760 --> 03:44.460\n And yes, like we went through and we added filters\n\n03:44.460 --> 03:46.460\n and there's a bunch of stories around that.\n\n03:46.460 --> 03:48.160\n But the origin of this was that\n\n03:48.160 --> 03:49.580\n we were trying to be a check in app,\n\n03:49.580 --> 03:52.360\n realized that no one wanted another check in app.\n\n03:52.360 --> 03:54.000\n It became a photo sharing app,\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:56.320\n but one that was much more about what you're doing\n\n03:56.320 --> 03:57.480\n and where you are.\n\n03:57.480 --> 03:58.600\n And that's why when I say,\n\n03:58.600 --> 04:01.000\n I think we've replaced check in apps,\n\n04:01.000 --> 04:03.680\n it became a check in via a photo\n\n04:03.680 --> 04:06.580\n rather than saying your location\n\n04:06.580 --> 04:08.760\n and then optionally adding a photo.\n\n04:08.760 --> 04:11.420\n When you were thinking about what people like,\n\n04:11.420 --> 04:13.240\n from where did you get a sense\n\n04:13.240 --> 04:14.520\n that this is what people like?\n\n04:14.520 --> 04:18.920\n You said, we sat down, we wrote some stuff down on paper.\n\n04:18.920 --> 04:21.920\n Where is that intuition that seems fundamental\n\n04:21.920 --> 04:26.820\n to the success of an app like Instagram?\n\n04:26.820 --> 04:27.880\n Where does that idea,\n\n04:27.880 --> 04:31.500\n where does that list of three things come from exactly?\n\n04:31.500 --> 04:33.640\n Only after having studied machine learning now\n\n04:33.640 --> 04:36.880\n for a couple of years, I like, I have a...\n\n04:36.880 --> 04:38.440\n You have understood yourself?\n\n04:39.400 --> 04:40.800\n I've started to make connections,\n\n04:40.800 --> 04:43.360\n like we can go into this later,\n\n04:43.360 --> 04:48.360\n but obviously the connections between machine learning\n\n04:50.960 --> 04:53.800\n and the human brain, I think are stretched sometimes.\n\n04:53.800 --> 04:57.400\n At the same time, being able to back prop\n\n04:57.400 --> 05:01.000\n and being able to look at the world, try something,\n\n05:01.000 --> 05:04.240\n figure out how you're wrong, how wrong you are,\n\n05:04.240 --> 05:08.040\n and then nudge your company in the right direction\n\n05:08.040 --> 05:10.100\n based on how wrong you are,\n\n05:10.100 --> 05:12.280\n is a fascinating concept.\n\n05:12.280 --> 05:14.720\n And I don't, we didn't know we were doing it at the time,\n\n05:14.720 --> 05:17.120\n but that's basically what we were doing, right?\n\n05:17.120 --> 05:19.440\n We put it out to, call it a hundred people,\n\n05:20.480 --> 05:22.780\n and you would look at their data.\n\n05:22.780 --> 05:25.200\n You would say, what are they sharing?\n\n05:25.200 --> 05:26.960\n Like what resonates, what doesn't resonate?\n\n05:26.960 --> 05:29.040\n We think they're gonna resonate with X,\n\n05:29.040 --> 05:31.100\n but it turns out they resonate with Y.\n\n05:31.100 --> 05:33.660\n Okay, shift the company towards Y.\n\n05:33.660 --> 05:36.320\n And it turns out if you do that enough quickly enough,\n\n05:36.320 --> 05:39.800\n you can get to a solution that has product market fit.\n\n05:39.800 --> 05:42.640\n Most companies fail because they sit there\n\n05:42.640 --> 05:45.520\n and they don't, either they're learning rates too slow,\n\n05:45.520 --> 05:46.640\n they sit there and they're just,\n\n05:46.640 --> 05:47.980\n they're adamant that they're right,\n\n05:47.980 --> 05:50.720\n even though the data is telling them they're not right,\n\n05:50.720 --> 05:53.240\n or they're learning rates too high\n\n05:53.240 --> 05:55.220\n and they wildly chase different ideas\n\n05:55.220 --> 05:57.120\n and they never actually settle on one\n\n05:57.120 --> 05:59.520\n where they don't groove, right?\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:00.600\n And I think when we sat down\n\n06:00.600 --> 06:01.960\n and we wrote out those three ideas,\n\n06:01.960 --> 06:05.720\n what we were saying is, what are the three possible,\n\n06:05.720 --> 06:10.440\n whether they're local or global maxima in our world, right?\n\n06:10.440 --> 06:12.800\n That users are telling us they like\n\n06:12.800 --> 06:14.960\n because they're using the product that way.\n\n06:14.960 --> 06:16.480\n It was clear people liked the photos\n\n06:16.480 --> 06:18.680\n because that was the thing they were doing.\n\n06:18.680 --> 06:20.320\n And we just said, okay, like,\n\n06:20.320 --> 06:22.540\n what if we just cut out most of the other stuff\n\n06:22.540 --> 06:24.100\n and focus on that thing?\n\n06:25.440 --> 06:27.480\n And then it happened to be a multi billion dollar business\n\n06:27.480 --> 06:30.240\n and it's that easy by the way.\n\n06:30.240 --> 06:32.320\n Yeah, I guess so.\n\n06:32.320 --> 06:34.320\n Well, nobody ever writes about neural networks\n\n06:34.320 --> 06:36.160\n that miserably failed.\n\n06:36.160 --> 06:38.480\n So this particular neural network succeeded.\n\n06:38.480 --> 06:40.240\n Oh, they sell all the time, right?\n\n06:40.240 --> 06:41.080\n Yeah.\n\n06:41.080 --> 06:41.900\n But nobody writes about it.\n\n06:41.900 --> 06:42.920\n The default state is failing.\n\n06:42.920 --> 06:43.760\n Yes.\n\n06:44.660 --> 06:47.320\n When you said the way people are using the app,\n\n06:48.320 --> 06:51.160\n is that the loss function for this neural network\n\n06:51.160 --> 06:52.960\n or is it also self report?\n\n06:52.960 --> 06:54.880\n Like, do you ever ask people what they like\n\n06:54.880 --> 06:58.540\n or do you have to track exactly what they're doing,\n\n06:58.540 --> 07:00.020\n not what they're saying?\n\n07:00.020 --> 07:03.120\n I once made a Thanksgiving dinner, okay?\n\n07:03.120 --> 07:08.080\n And it was for relatives and I like to cook a lot.\n\n07:08.080 --> 07:09.080\n Okay.\n\n07:09.080 --> 07:13.680\n And I worked really hard on picking the specific dishes\n\n07:13.680 --> 07:17.060\n and I was really proud because I had planned it out\n\n07:17.060 --> 07:19.880\n using a Gantt chart and like it was ready on time\n\n07:19.880 --> 07:21.240\n and everything was hot.\n\n07:21.240 --> 07:22.080\n Nice.\n\n07:22.080 --> 07:23.280\n Like, I don't know if you're a big Thanksgiving guy,\n\n07:23.280 --> 07:25.640\n but like the worst thing about Thanksgiving\n\n07:25.640 --> 07:28.120\n is when the turkey is cold and some things are hot\n\n07:28.120 --> 07:29.220\n and some things, anyway.\n\n07:29.220 --> 07:30.060\n You had a Gantt chart.\n\n07:30.060 --> 07:31.340\n Did you actually have a chart?\n\n07:31.340 --> 07:32.180\n Oh yeah.\n\n07:32.180 --> 07:36.040\n OmniPlan, fairly expensive, like Gantt chart thing\n\n07:36.040 --> 07:39.380\n that I think maybe 10 people have purchased in the world,\n\n07:39.380 --> 07:42.260\n but I'm one of them and I use it for recipe planning\n\n07:42.260 --> 07:44.380\n only around big holidays.\n\n07:44.380 --> 07:45.920\n That's brilliant, by the way.\n\n07:45.920 --> 07:47.840\n Do people do this kind of...\n\n07:47.840 --> 07:48.920\n Overengineering?\n\n07:48.920 --> 07:50.820\n It's not overengineering, it's just engineering.\n\n07:50.820 --> 07:51.660\n It's planning.\n\n07:51.660 --> 07:54.720\n Thanksgiving is a complicated set of events\n\n07:54.720 --> 07:57.420\n with some uncertainty with a lot of things going on.\n\n07:57.420 --> 07:59.760\n You should be able, you should be planning it in this way.\n\n07:59.760 --> 08:00.840\n There should be a chart.\n\n08:00.840 --> 08:01.660\n It's not overengineering.\n\n08:01.660 --> 08:04.860\n I mean, so what's funny is, brief aside.\n\n08:04.860 --> 08:06.420\n Yes, it's brilliant.\n\n08:06.420 --> 08:08.660\n I love cooking, I love food, I love coffee,\n\n08:08.660 --> 08:10.340\n and I've spent some time with some chefs\n\n08:10.340 --> 08:12.180\n who like know their stuff.\n\n08:12.180 --> 08:15.500\n And they always just take out a piece of paper\n\n08:15.500 --> 08:17.900\n and just work backwards in rough order.\n\n08:17.900 --> 08:20.540\n Like it's never perfect, but rough order.\n\n08:20.540 --> 08:21.900\n It's just like, oh, that makes sense.\n\n08:21.900 --> 08:24.740\n Why not just work backwards from the end goal, right?\n\n08:24.740 --> 08:26.060\n And put in some buffer time.\n\n08:26.060 --> 08:29.860\n And so I probably over specified it a bit using a Gantt chart,\n\n08:29.860 --> 08:32.720\n but the fact that you can do it,\n\n08:32.720 --> 08:35.220\n it's what professional kitchens roughly do.\n\n08:35.220 --> 08:36.880\n They just don't call it a Gantt chart,\n\n08:36.880 --> 08:38.700\n or at least I don't think they do.\n\n08:38.700 --> 08:40.280\n Anyway, I was telling a story about Thanksgiving.\n\n08:40.280 --> 08:42.940\n So here's the thing.\n\n08:42.940 --> 08:44.700\n I'm sitting down, we have the meal,\n\n08:44.700 --> 08:49.220\n and then I got to know Ray Dalio fairly well\n\n08:49.220 --> 08:51.660\n over maybe the last year of Instagram.\n\n08:53.060 --> 08:55.100\n And one thing that he kept saying was like,\n\n08:55.100 --> 08:59.900\n feedback is really hard to get honestly from people.\n\n08:59.900 --> 09:02.420\n And I sat down after dinner, I said,\n\n09:02.420 --> 09:03.680\n guys, I want feedback.\n\n09:03.680 --> 09:05.640\n What was good and what was bad?\n\n09:05.640 --> 09:06.480\n Yes.\n\n09:06.480 --> 09:07.820\n And what's funny is like,\n\n09:07.820 --> 09:11.140\n literally everyone just said everything was great.\n\n09:11.140 --> 09:13.380\n And I like personally knew I had screwed up\n\n09:13.380 --> 09:17.580\n a handful of things, but no one would say it.\n\n09:17.580 --> 09:20.740\n And can you imagine now not something as high stakes\n\n09:20.740 --> 09:22.020\n as Thanksgiving dinner, okay?\n\n09:22.020 --> 09:25.100\n Thanksgiving dinner, it's not that high stakes.\n\n09:25.100 --> 09:26.380\n But you're trying to build a product\n\n09:26.380 --> 09:28.380\n and everyone knows you left your job for it\n\n09:28.380 --> 09:29.540\n and you're trying to build it out\n\n09:29.540 --> 09:32.000\n and you're trying to make something wonderful\n\n09:32.000 --> 09:33.440\n and it's yours, right?\n\n09:33.440 --> 09:34.560\n You designed it.\n\n09:35.580 --> 09:37.900\n Now try asking for feedback\n\n09:37.900 --> 09:39.980\n and know that you're giving this to your friends\n\n09:39.980 --> 09:41.100\n and your family.\n\n09:42.180 --> 09:45.580\n People have trouble giving hard feedback.\n\n09:45.580 --> 09:48.860\n People have trouble saying, I don't like this\n\n09:48.860 --> 09:51.980\n or this isn't great, or this is how it's failed me.\n\n09:51.980 --> 09:56.600\n In fact, you usually have two classes of people.\n\n09:56.600 --> 09:58.780\n People who just won't say bad things,\n\n09:58.780 --> 10:00.440\n you can literally say to them,\n\n10:00.440 --> 10:02.380\n please tell me what you hate most about this\n\n10:02.380 --> 10:03.220\n and they won't do it.\n\n10:03.220 --> 10:04.420\n They'll try, but they won't.\n\n10:05.580 --> 10:06.900\n And then the other class of people\n\n10:06.900 --> 10:09.700\n are just negative period about everything\n\n10:09.700 --> 10:13.920\n and it's hard to parse out like what is true and what isn't.\n\n10:14.840 --> 10:17.700\n So my rule of thumb with this is\n\n10:17.700 --> 10:20.100\n you should always ask people,\n\n10:20.100 --> 10:22.300\n but at the end of the day, it's amazing what data\n\n10:22.300 --> 10:23.440\n will tell you.\n\n10:23.440 --> 10:27.280\n And that's why with whatever project I work on, even now,\n\n10:27.280 --> 10:30.220\n collecting data from the beginning on usage patterns,\n\n10:30.220 --> 10:34.340\n so engagement, how many days of the week do they use it?\n\n10:34.340 --> 10:36.660\n How many, I don't know if we were to go back to Instagram,\n\n10:36.660 --> 10:39.460\n how many impressions per day, right?\n\n10:39.460 --> 10:40.280\n Is that growing?\n\n10:40.280 --> 10:41.120\n Is that shrinking?\n\n10:41.120 --> 10:44.740\n And don't be like overly scientific about it, right?\n\n10:44.740 --> 10:48.300\n Cause maybe you have 50 beta users or something.\n\n10:48.300 --> 10:52.740\n But what's fascinating is that data doesn't lie.\n\n10:52.740 --> 10:57.580\n People are very defensive about their time.\n\n10:57.580 --> 10:59.260\n They'll say, oh, I'm so busy,\n\n10:59.260 --> 11:00.740\n I'm sorry I didn't get to use the app.\n\n11:00.740 --> 11:03.300\n Like I'm just, you know,\n\n11:03.300 --> 11:05.220\n but I don't know you were posting on Instagram\n\n11:05.220 --> 11:06.040\n the whole time.\n\n11:07.140 --> 11:09.260\n So I don't know at the end of the day,\n\n11:09.260 --> 11:11.500\n like at Facebook there was, you know,\n\n11:11.500 --> 11:15.820\n before time spent became kind of this loaded term there.\n\n11:15.820 --> 11:20.820\n The idea that people's currency in their lives is time.\n\n11:21.060 --> 11:23.380\n And they only have a certain amount of time to give things,\n\n11:23.380 --> 11:26.260\n whether it's friends or family or apps or TV shows\n\n11:26.260 --> 11:28.940\n or whatever, there's no way of inventing more of it,\n\n11:28.940 --> 11:30.340\n at least not that I know of.\n\n11:32.700 --> 11:35.540\n If they don't use it, it's because it's not great.\n\n11:35.540 --> 11:39.720\n So the moral of the story is you can ask all you want,\n\n11:39.720 --> 11:41.860\n but you just have to look at the data.\n\n11:41.860 --> 11:45.340\n And data doesn't lie, right?\n\n11:45.340 --> 11:50.340\n I mean, there's metrics, there's data can obscure\n\n11:51.140 --> 11:54.020\n the key insight if you're not careful.\n\n11:54.020 --> 11:57.940\n So time spent in the app, that's one.\n\n11:57.940 --> 11:59.820\n There's so many metrics you can put at this\n\n11:59.820 --> 12:02.500\n and they will give you totally different insights,\n\n12:02.500 --> 12:04.600\n especially when you're trying to create something\n\n12:04.600 --> 12:07.660\n that doesn't obviously exist yet.\n\n12:07.660 --> 12:12.660\n So, you know, measuring maybe why you left the app\n\n12:12.660 --> 12:17.660\n or measuring special moments of happiness\n\n12:17.780 --> 12:20.020\n that will make sure you return to the app\n\n12:20.020 --> 12:22.380\n or moments of happiness that are long lasting\n\n12:22.380 --> 12:26.440\n versus like dopamine short term, all of those things.\n\n12:26.440 --> 12:28.680\n But I think I suppose in the beginning,\n\n12:29.660 --> 12:33.180\n you can just get away with just asking the question,\n\n12:33.180 --> 12:35.380\n which features are used a lot?\n\n12:35.380 --> 12:37.260\n Let's do more of that.\n\n12:37.260 --> 12:40.720\n And how hard was the decision?\n\n12:40.720 --> 12:43.180\n And I mean, maybe you can tell me what Instagram\n\n12:43.180 --> 12:44.460\n looked in the beginning,\n\n12:44.460 --> 12:47.060\n but how hard was it to make pictures\n\n12:47.060 --> 12:48.500\n of the first class citizen?\n\n12:48.500 --> 12:50.460\n That's a revolutionary idea.\n\n12:50.460 --> 12:55.460\n Like at whatever point Instagram became this feed of photos,\n\n12:56.820 --> 12:58.460\n that's quite brilliant.\n\n12:58.460 --> 13:02.020\n Plus, I also don't know when this happened,\n\n13:02.020 --> 13:04.340\n but they're all shaped the same.\n\n13:05.660 --> 13:06.500\n It's like a...\n\n13:06.500 --> 13:09.100\n I have to tell you why, that's the interesting part.\n\n13:09.100 --> 13:10.980\n Why is that?\n\n13:10.980 --> 13:11.900\n So a couple of things.\n\n13:11.900 --> 13:16.820\n One is data, like you're right.\n\n13:16.820 --> 13:18.020\n You can overinterpret data.\n\n13:18.020 --> 13:22.780\n Like imagine trying to fly a plane by staring at,\n\n13:22.780 --> 13:25.700\n I don't know, a single metric like airspeed.\n\n13:25.700 --> 13:27.060\n You don't know if you're going up or down.\n\n13:27.060 --> 13:28.580\n I mean, it correlates with up or down,\n\n13:28.580 --> 13:29.980\n but you don't actually know.\n\n13:29.980 --> 13:32.240\n It will never help you land the plane.\n\n13:32.240 --> 13:33.940\n So don't stare at one metric.\n\n13:33.940 --> 13:36.840\n Like it turns out you have to synthesize a bunch of metrics\n\n13:36.840 --> 13:37.900\n to know where to go.\n\n13:37.900 --> 13:40.140\n But it doesn't lie.\n\n13:40.140 --> 13:41.380\n Like if your airspeed is zero,\n\n13:41.380 --> 13:43.100\n unless it's not working, right?\n\n13:43.100 --> 13:46.380\n If it's zero, you're probably gonna fall out of the sky.\n\n13:46.380 --> 13:50.540\n So generally you look around and you have the scan going.\n\n13:50.540 --> 13:51.660\n Yes.\n\n13:51.660 --> 13:52.900\n And you're just asking yourself,\n\n13:52.900 --> 13:54.900\n is this working or is this not working?\n\n13:56.340 --> 14:01.340\n But people have trouble explaining how they actually feel.\n\n14:02.700 --> 14:05.100\n So just, it's about synthesizing both of them.\n\n14:05.100 --> 14:07.780\n So then Instagram, right?\n\n14:07.780 --> 14:10.460\n We were talking about revolutionary moment\n\n14:10.460 --> 14:14.180\n where the feed became square photos basically.\n\n14:14.180 --> 14:16.340\n And photos first and then square photos.\n\n14:16.340 --> 14:17.180\n Yeah.\n\n14:19.020 --> 14:21.500\n It was clear to me that the biggest,\n\n14:21.500 --> 14:26.500\n so I believe the biggest companies are founded\n\n14:26.900 --> 14:30.780\n when enormous technical shifts happen.\n\n14:30.780 --> 14:32.860\n And the biggest technical shift that happened\n\n14:32.860 --> 14:34.860\n right before Instagram was founded\n\n14:34.860 --> 14:38.020\n was the advent of a phone that didn't suck.\n\n14:38.020 --> 14:38.980\n The iPhone, right?\n\n14:38.980 --> 14:40.740\n Like in retrospect, we're like, oh my God,\n\n14:40.740 --> 14:43.180\n the first iPhone that almost had,\n\n14:43.180 --> 14:44.540\n like it wasn't that good.\n\n14:44.540 --> 14:46.800\n But compared to everything else at the time,\n\n14:46.800 --> 14:48.940\n it was amazing.\n\n14:48.940 --> 14:50.140\n And by the way,\n\n14:50.140 --> 14:54.760\n the first phone that had an incredible camera\n\n14:54.760 --> 14:57.740\n that could like do as well as the point and shoot\n\n14:57.740 --> 15:01.100\n you might carry around was the iPhone 4.\n\n15:01.100 --> 15:02.940\n And that was right when Instagram launched.\n\n15:02.940 --> 15:04.660\n And we looked around and we said,\n\n15:04.660 --> 15:05.940\n what will change?\n\n15:05.940 --> 15:08.540\n Because everyone has a camera in their pocket.\n\n15:08.540 --> 15:11.800\n And it was so clear to me that the world\n\n15:11.800 --> 15:16.800\n of social networks before it was based in the desktop\n\n15:16.860 --> 15:20.780\n and sitting there and having a link you could share, right?\n\n15:20.780 --> 15:21.780\n And that wasn't gonna be the case.\n\n15:21.780 --> 15:23.420\n So the question is what would you share\n\n15:23.420 --> 15:25.400\n if you were out and about in the world?\n\n15:26.900 --> 15:29.600\n If not only did you have a camera that fit in your pocket,\n\n15:29.600 --> 15:31.980\n but by the way, that camera had a network attached to it\n\n15:31.980 --> 15:34.780\n that allowed you to share instantly.\n\n15:34.780 --> 15:36.100\n That seemed revolutionary.\n\n15:36.100 --> 15:37.700\n And a bunch of people saw it at the same time.\n\n15:37.700 --> 15:38.760\n It wasn't just Instagram.\n\n15:38.760 --> 15:40.460\n There were a bunch of competitors.\n\n15:41.340 --> 15:44.100\n The thing we did, I think was not only,\n\n15:44.100 --> 15:45.320\n well, we focused on two things.\n\n15:45.320 --> 15:47.700\n So we wrote down those things, we circled photos\n\n15:47.700 --> 15:50.100\n and we said, I think we should invest in this.\n\n15:50.100 --> 15:52.760\n But then we said, what sucks about photos?\n\n15:52.760 --> 15:55.500\n One, they look like crap, right?\n\n15:55.500 --> 15:57.060\n They just, at least back then.\n\n15:57.060 --> 16:01.340\n Now my phone takes pretty great photos, right?\n\n16:01.340 --> 16:05.260\n Back then they were blurry, not so great, compressed, right?\n\n16:06.140 --> 16:11.140\n Two, it was really slow, like really slow to upload a photo.\n\n16:12.200 --> 16:13.700\n And I'll tell a fun story about that\n\n16:13.700 --> 16:15.900\n and explain to you why they're all the same size\n\n16:15.900 --> 16:16.980\n and square as well.\n\n16:18.220 --> 16:21.780\n And three, man, if you wanted to share a photo\n\n16:21.780 --> 16:24.020\n on different networks, you had to go to each\n\n16:24.020 --> 16:26.620\n of the individual apps and select all of them\n\n16:26.620 --> 16:27.780\n and upload individually.\n\n16:27.780 --> 16:30.580\n And so we were like, all right, those are the pain points.\n\n16:30.580 --> 16:31.940\n We're gonna focus on that.\n\n16:31.940 --> 16:36.020\n So one, instead of, because they weren't beautiful,\n\n16:36.020 --> 16:37.540\n we were like, why don't we lean into the fact\n\n16:37.540 --> 16:38.380\n that they're not beautiful?\n\n16:38.380 --> 16:40.620\n And I remember studying in Florence,\n\n16:40.620 --> 16:42.980\n my photography teacher gave me this Holga camera\n\n16:42.980 --> 16:44.940\n and I'm not sure everyone knows what a Holga camera is,\n\n16:44.940 --> 16:47.180\n but they're these old school plastic cameras.\n\n16:48.180 --> 16:50.760\n I think they're produced in China at the time.\n\n16:52.100 --> 16:54.240\n And I wanna say the original ones were like\n\n16:54.240 --> 16:55.980\n from the 70s or the 80s or something.\n\n16:55.980 --> 16:58.940\n They're supposed to be like $3 cameras for the every person.\n\n16:58.940 --> 17:03.940\n They took nice medium format films, large negatives,\n\n17:05.200 --> 17:07.880\n but they kind of blurred the light\n\n17:07.880 --> 17:10.240\n and they kind of like light leaked into the side.\n\n17:10.240 --> 17:13.200\n And there was this whole resurgence where people looked\n\n17:13.200 --> 17:16.900\n at that and said, oh my God, this is a style, right?\n\n17:16.900 --> 17:19.020\n And I remember using that in Florence and just saying,\n\n17:19.020 --> 17:20.840\n well, why don't we just like lean into the fact\n\n17:20.840 --> 17:24.320\n that these photos suck and make them suck more,\n\n17:24.320 --> 17:26.220\n but in an artistic way.\n\n17:26.220 --> 17:28.040\n And it turns out that had product market fit.\n\n17:28.040 --> 17:29.200\n People really liked that.\n\n17:29.200 --> 17:31.720\n They were willing to share their not so great photos\n\n17:31.720 --> 17:35.820\n if they looked not so great on purpose, okay?\n\n17:35.820 --> 17:37.400\n The second part.\n\n17:37.400 --> 17:40.320\n That's where the filters come into picture.\n\n17:40.320 --> 17:42.560\n So computational modification of photos\n\n17:42.560 --> 17:46.200\n to make them look extra crappy to where it becomes art.\n\n17:46.200 --> 17:47.040\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n17:47.040 --> 17:51.720\n And I mean, add light leaks, add like an overlay filter,\n\n17:51.720 --> 17:54.120\n make them more contrasty than they should be.\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:58.080\n The first filter we ever produced was called X Pro 2.\n\n17:58.080 --> 17:59.600\n And I designed it while I was\n\n17:59.600 --> 18:02.160\n in this small little bed and breakfast room\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:03.640\n in Todos Santos, Mexico.\n\n18:03.640 --> 18:06.800\n I was trying to take a break from the bourbon days.\n\n18:06.800 --> 18:08.840\n And I remember saying to my co founder,\n\n18:08.840 --> 18:11.080\n I just need like a week to reset.\n\n18:11.080 --> 18:15.080\n And that was on that trip worked on the first filter\n\n18:15.080 --> 18:17.240\n because I said, you know, I think I can do this.\n\n18:17.240 --> 18:22.080\n And I literally iterated one by one over the RGB values\n\n18:22.080 --> 18:26.280\n in the array that was the photo and just slightly shifted.\n\n18:26.280 --> 18:29.400\n Basically there was a function of R, function of G,\n\n18:29.400 --> 18:32.480\n function of B that just shifted them slightly.\n\n18:32.480 --> 18:34.000\n It was in rocket science.\n\n18:34.000 --> 18:36.540\n And it turns out that actually\n\n18:36.540 --> 18:38.520\n made your photo look pretty cool.\n\n18:38.520 --> 18:42.820\n It just mapped from one color space to another color space.\n\n18:42.820 --> 18:44.440\n It was simple, but it was really slow.\n\n18:44.440 --> 18:47.320\n I mean, if you applied a filter,\n\n18:47.320 --> 18:50.500\n I think it used to take two or three seconds to render.\n\n18:50.500 --> 18:53.200\n Only eventually would I figure out how to do it on the GPU.\n\n18:53.200 --> 18:56.400\n And I'm not even sure it was a GPU, but it was using OpenGL.\n\n18:56.400 --> 18:59.960\n But anyway, I would eventually figure that out\n\n18:59.960 --> 19:02.800\n and then it would be instant, but it used to be really slow.\n\n19:02.800 --> 19:06.000\n By the way, anyone who's watching or listening,\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:10.080\n it's amazing what you can get away with in a startup\n\n19:10.080 --> 19:14.080\n as long as the product outcome is right for the user.\n\n19:14.080 --> 19:15.440\n Like you can be slow.\n\n19:15.440 --> 19:16.480\n You can be terrible.\n\n19:16.480 --> 19:21.000\n You can be, as long as you have product market fit,\n\n19:21.000 --> 19:22.440\n people will put up with a lot.\n\n19:22.440 --> 19:24.960\n And then the question is just about compressing,\n\n19:25.840 --> 19:27.640\n making it more performant over time\n\n19:27.640 --> 19:30.440\n so that they get that product market fit instantly.\n\n19:30.440 --> 19:32.800\n So fascinating because there's some things\n\n19:32.800 --> 19:37.440\n where those three seconds would make or break the app,\n\n19:37.440 --> 19:39.480\n but some things you're saying not.\n\n19:39.480 --> 19:43.480\n It's hard to know when, it's the problem Spotify solved\n\n19:43.480 --> 19:47.500\n for making streaming like work.\n\n19:48.500 --> 19:53.060\n And like delays in listening to music is a huge negative,\n\n19:53.060 --> 19:54.660\n even like slight delays.\n\n19:55.480 --> 19:57.260\n But here you're saying, I mean,\n\n19:57.260 --> 20:00.580\n how do you know when those three seconds are okay\n\n20:00.580 --> 20:03.820\n or are you just gonna have to try it out?\n\n20:03.820 --> 20:07.380\n Because to me, my intuition would be\n\n20:07.380 --> 20:09.940\n those three seconds would kill the app.\n\n20:09.940 --> 20:12.300\n Like I would try to do the OpenGL thing.\n\n20:12.300 --> 20:16.220\n Right, so I wish I were that smart at the time.\n\n20:17.600 --> 20:20.780\n I wasn't, I just knew how to do what I knew how to do.\n\n20:21.680 --> 20:23.580\n And I decided, okay, like,\n\n20:23.580 --> 20:27.220\n why don't I just iterate over the values and change them?\n\n20:27.220 --> 20:29.580\n And what's interesting is that\n\n20:31.820 --> 20:35.340\n compared to the alternatives, no one else used OpenGL.\n\n20:35.340 --> 20:37.140\n So everyone else was doing it the dumb way.\n\n20:37.140 --> 20:40.460\n And in fact, they were doing it at a high resolution.\n\n20:40.460 --> 20:42.500\n Now comes in the small resolution\n\n20:42.500 --> 20:45.140\n that we'll talk about in a second.\n\n20:45.140 --> 20:48.620\n By choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels,\n\n20:48.620 --> 20:51.000\n which I believe it was at the time,\n\n20:51.000 --> 20:54.340\n we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than our competitors\n\n20:54.340 --> 20:58.180\n who were trying to do these enormous output like images.\n\n20:58.180 --> 21:00.940\n So instead of taking 20 seconds,\n\n21:00.940 --> 21:03.320\n I mean, three seconds feels pretty good, right?\n\n21:03.320 --> 21:06.340\n So on a relative basis, we were winning like a lot.\n\n21:06.340 --> 21:08.520\n Okay, so that's answer number one.\n\n21:08.520 --> 21:11.580\n Answer number two is we actually focused\n\n21:11.580 --> 21:13.140\n on latency in the right places.\n\n21:13.140 --> 21:17.460\n So we did this really wonderful thing when you uploaded.\n\n21:17.460 --> 21:20.900\n So the way it would work is you'd take your phone,\n\n21:20.900 --> 21:24.040\n you'd take the photo and then you'd go to the,\n\n21:25.040 --> 21:27.780\n you'd go to the edit screen where you would caption it.\n\n21:28.820 --> 21:31.180\n And on that caption screen, you'd start typing\n\n21:31.180 --> 21:34.180\n and you'd think, okay, like what's a clever caption?\n\n21:34.180 --> 21:36.380\n And I said to Mike, hey, when I worked on the Gmail team,\n\n21:36.380 --> 21:37.440\n you know what they did?\n\n21:37.440 --> 21:40.820\n When you typed in your username or your email address,\n\n21:40.820 --> 21:43.220\n even before you've entered in your password,\n\n21:43.220 --> 21:47.100\n like the probability once you enter in your username\n\n21:47.100 --> 21:51.100\n that you're going to actually sign in is extremely high.\n\n21:51.100 --> 21:52.620\n So why not just start loading your account\n\n21:52.620 --> 21:53.460\n in the background?\n\n21:53.460 --> 21:55.700\n Not like sending it down to the desktop,\n\n21:55.700 --> 21:59.380\n that would be a security issue,\n\n21:59.380 --> 22:01.340\n but like loaded into memory on the server,\n\n22:01.340 --> 22:03.600\n like get it ready, prepare it.\n\n22:03.600 --> 22:06.980\n I always thought that was so fascinating and unintuitive.\n\n22:06.980 --> 22:08.900\n And I was like, Mike, why don't we just do that?\n\n22:08.900 --> 22:10.440\n But like, we'll just upload the photo\n\n22:10.440 --> 22:14.140\n and like assume you're going to upload the photo.\n\n22:14.140 --> 22:17.620\n And if you don't, forget about it, we'll delete it, right?\n\n22:17.620 --> 22:20.340\n So what ended up happening was people would caption\n\n22:20.340 --> 22:24.660\n their photo, they'd press done or upload\n\n22:24.660 --> 22:27.940\n and you'd see this little progress bar just go foop.\n\n22:27.940 --> 22:30.180\n It was lightning fast, okay?\n\n22:30.180 --> 22:32.960\n We were no faster than anyone else at the time,\n\n22:32.960 --> 22:37.420\n but by choosing 512 by 512 and doing it in the background,\n\n22:37.420 --> 22:39.680\n it almost guaranteed that it was done\n\n22:39.680 --> 22:41.340\n by the time you captioned.\n\n22:41.340 --> 22:43.980\n And everyone when they used it was like,\n\n22:43.980 --> 22:47.000\n how the hell is this thing so fast?\n\n22:47.000 --> 22:49.340\n But we were slow, we just hid the slowness.\n\n22:49.340 --> 22:51.460\n It wasn't like, these things are just like,\n\n22:51.460 --> 22:54.240\n it's a shell game, you're just hiding the latency.\n\n22:55.180 --> 22:58.720\n That mattered to people like a lot.\n\n22:58.720 --> 23:01.020\n And I think that, so you were willing to put up\n\n23:01.020 --> 23:03.500\n with a slow filter if it meant\n\n23:03.500 --> 23:04.700\n you could share it immediately.\n\n23:04.700 --> 23:06.580\n And of course we added sharing options\n\n23:06.580 --> 23:08.220\n which let you distribute it really quickly,\n\n23:08.220 --> 23:09.420\n that was the third part.\n\n23:11.400 --> 23:14.520\n So latency matters, but relative to what?\n\n23:14.520 --> 23:17.500\n And then there's some like tricks,\n\n23:17.500 --> 23:20.580\n you get around to just hiding the latency.\n\n23:20.580 --> 23:23.020\n Like I don't know if Spotify starts downloading\n\n23:23.020 --> 23:25.740\n the next song eagerly, I'm assuming they do.\n\n23:25.740 --> 23:29.300\n There are a bunch of ideas here that are not rocket science\n\n23:29.300 --> 23:31.740\n that really help.\n\n23:31.740 --> 23:35.100\n And all of that was stuff you were explicitly\n\n23:35.100 --> 23:37.820\n having a discussion about, like those designs\n\n23:37.820 --> 23:40.680\n and you were having like arguments, discussions.\n\n23:41.660 --> 23:43.540\n I'm not sure it was arguments, I mean,\n\n23:43.540 --> 23:45.480\n I'm not sure if you've met my co founder Mike,\n\n23:45.480 --> 23:48.460\n but he's a pretty nice guy and he's very reasonable.\n\n23:48.460 --> 23:51.220\n And we both just saw eye to eye and we're like,\n\n23:51.220 --> 23:55.480\n yeah, it's like, make this fast or at least seem fast,\n\n23:56.500 --> 23:57.340\n it'll be great.\n\n23:57.340 --> 23:59.460\n Honestly, I think the most contentious thing\n\n23:59.460 --> 24:01.260\n and he would say this too initially,\n\n24:02.740 --> 24:07.740\n was I was on an iPhone 3G, so like the not so fast one.\n\n24:08.300 --> 24:10.860\n And he had a brand new iPhone 4, that was cheap.\n\n24:10.860 --> 24:12.500\n Nice.\n\n24:12.500 --> 24:15.140\n And his feed loaded super smoothly,\n\n24:15.140 --> 24:17.460\n like when he would scroll from photo to photo,\n\n24:18.760 --> 24:20.380\n buttery smooth, right?\n\n24:20.380 --> 24:22.780\n But on my phone, every time you got to a new photo,\n\n24:22.780 --> 24:25.420\n it was like, kachunk, kachunk, allocate memory,\n\n24:25.420 --> 24:27.460\n like all this stuff, right?\n\n24:27.460 --> 24:29.300\n I was like, Mike, that's unacceptable.\n\n24:29.300 --> 24:31.860\n He's like, oh, come on, man, just like upgrade your phone.\n\n24:31.860 --> 24:33.260\n Basically, he didn't actually say that,\n\n24:33.260 --> 24:34.460\n he was nicer than that.\n\n24:35.780 --> 24:36.900\n But I could tell he wished like,\n\n24:36.900 --> 24:39.680\n I would just stop being cheap and just get a new phone.\n\n24:39.680 --> 24:41.540\n But what's funny is we actually sat there working\n\n24:41.540 --> 24:45.420\n on that little detail for a few days before launch.\n\n24:45.420 --> 24:48.620\n And that polished experience,\n\n24:48.620 --> 24:51.060\n plus the fact that uploading seemed fast\n\n24:51.060 --> 24:54.380\n for all these people who didn't have nice phones,\n\n24:54.380 --> 24:57.820\n I think meant a lot because far too often,\n\n24:57.820 --> 25:00.560\n you see teams focus not on performance,\n\n25:00.560 --> 25:03.980\n they focus on what's the cool computer science problem\n\n25:03.980 --> 25:05.940\n they can solve, right?\n\n25:05.940 --> 25:08.500\n Can we scale this thing to a billion users\n\n25:08.500 --> 25:11.040\n and they've got like a hundred, right?\n\n25:11.040 --> 25:11.880\n Yeah.\n\n25:12.780 --> 25:14.020\n You talked about loss function,\n\n25:14.020 --> 25:16.060\n so I want to come back to that.\n\n25:16.060 --> 25:17.780\n Like the loss function is like,\n\n25:17.780 --> 25:20.700\n do you provide a great, happy, magical,\n\n25:20.700 --> 25:23.160\n whatever experience for the consumer?\n\n25:23.160 --> 25:25.980\n And listen, if it happens to involve something complex\n\n25:25.980 --> 25:27.760\n and technical, then great.\n\n25:27.760 --> 25:30.800\n But it turns out, I think most of the time,\n\n25:32.260 --> 25:34.820\n those experiences are just sitting there waiting to be built\n\n25:34.820 --> 25:37.800\n with like not that complex solutions.\n\n25:38.620 --> 25:40.860\n But everyone is just like so stuck in their own head\n\n25:40.860 --> 25:42.660\n that they have to overengineer everything\n\n25:42.660 --> 25:45.020\n and then they forget about the easy stuff.\n\n25:45.020 --> 25:48.460\n I mean, also, maybe to flip the loss function there is,\n\n25:48.460 --> 25:50.780\n you're trying to minimize the number of times\n\n25:50.780 --> 25:54.040\n there's unpleasant experience, right?\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:56.100\n Like the one you mentioned where when you go\n\n25:56.100 --> 25:58.460\n to the next photo, it freezes for a little bit.\n\n25:58.460 --> 26:00.960\n So it's almost, as opposed to maximizing pleasure,\n\n26:00.960 --> 26:04.720\n it's probably easier to minimize the number of like,\n\n26:04.720 --> 26:05.860\n the friction.\n\n26:05.860 --> 26:06.700\n Yeah.\n\n26:06.700 --> 26:10.420\n And as we all know, you just make the pleasure negative\n\n26:10.420 --> 26:13.060\n and then minimize everything, so.\n\n26:13.060 --> 26:14.980\n We're mapping this all back to neural networks.\n\n26:14.980 --> 26:16.560\n But actually, can I say one thing on that,\n\n26:16.560 --> 26:19.760\n which is I don't know a lot about machine learning,\n\n26:19.760 --> 26:23.060\n but I feel like I've tried studying a bunch.\n\n26:23.060 --> 26:25.900\n That whole idea of reinforcement learning\n\n26:26.880 --> 26:30.620\n and planning out more than the greedy single experience,\n\n26:30.620 --> 26:34.060\n I think is the closest you can get\n\n26:34.060 --> 26:38.580\n to like ideal product design thinking,\n\n26:38.580 --> 26:39.980\n where you're not saying,\n\n26:39.980 --> 26:43.740\n hey, like, can we have a great experience just this one time?\n\n26:43.740 --> 26:46.340\n But like, what is the right way to onboard someone?\n\n26:46.340 --> 26:50.060\n What series of experiences correlate most with them\n\n26:50.060 --> 26:52.660\n hanging on long term, right?\n\n26:52.660 --> 26:55.620\n So not just saying, oh, did the photo load slowly\n\n26:55.620 --> 26:57.940\n a couple of times, or did they get a great photo\n\n26:57.940 --> 27:00.060\n at the top of their feed?\n\n27:00.060 --> 27:01.860\n But like, what are the things that are gonna make\n\n27:01.860 --> 27:04.940\n this person come back over the next week,\n\n27:04.940 --> 27:06.380\n over the next month?\n\n27:06.380 --> 27:08.460\n And as a product designer asking yourself,\n\n27:08.460 --> 27:11.720\n okay, I wanna optimize, not just minimize bad experiences\n\n27:11.720 --> 27:13.060\n in the short run, but like,\n\n27:13.060 --> 27:17.900\n how do I get someone to engage over the next month?\n\n27:17.900 --> 27:20.780\n And I'm not gonna claim at all that I thought that way\n\n27:20.780 --> 27:23.120\n at all at the time, because I certainly didn't.\n\n27:23.120 --> 27:25.540\n But if I were going back and giving myself any advice,\n\n27:25.540 --> 27:28.700\n it would be thinking, what are those second order effects\n\n27:28.700 --> 27:30.380\n that you can create?\n\n27:30.380 --> 27:33.380\n And it turns out having your friends on the service\n\n27:33.380 --> 27:34.860\n is an enormous win.\n\n27:34.860 --> 27:37.580\n So starting with a very small group of people\n\n27:37.580 --> 27:40.520\n that produce content that you wanted to see, which we did,\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:43.860\n we seeded the community very well, I think.\n\n27:43.860 --> 27:46.620\n Ended up mattering, and so.\n\n27:46.620 --> 27:48.200\n Yeah, you said that community is one\n\n27:48.200 --> 27:49.660\n of the most important things.\n\n27:49.660 --> 27:52.020\n So it's from a metrics perspective,\n\n27:52.020 --> 27:55.220\n from maybe a philosophy perspective,\n\n27:55.220 --> 27:57.900\n building a certain kind of community within the app.\n\n27:57.900 --> 28:00.580\n See, I wasn't sure what exactly you meant by that\n\n28:00.580 --> 28:01.940\n when I first heard you say that.\n\n28:01.940 --> 28:04.420\n Maybe you can elaborate, but as I understand now,\n\n28:04.420 --> 28:09.420\n it can literally mean get your friends onto the app.\n\n28:09.420 --> 28:11.960\n Yeah, think of it this way.\n\n28:12.900 --> 28:16.700\n You can build an amazing restaurant or bar or whatever,\n\n28:16.700 --> 28:20.300\n right, but if you show up and you're the only one there,\n\n28:20.300 --> 28:22.920\n is it like, does it matter how good the food is?\n\n28:24.020 --> 28:25.620\n The drinks, whatever?\n\n28:25.620 --> 28:28.820\n No, these are inherently social experiences\n\n28:28.820 --> 28:30.460\n that we were working on.\n\n28:30.460 --> 28:34.320\n So the idea of having people there,\n\n28:35.580 --> 28:36.900\n like you needed to have that,\n\n28:36.900 --> 28:39.220\n otherwise it was just a filter out.\n\n28:39.220 --> 28:41.380\n But by the way, part of the genius,\n\n28:41.380 --> 28:43.900\n I'm gonna say genius, even though it wasn't really genius,\n\n28:43.900 --> 28:48.900\n was starting to be marauding as a filter app was awesome.\n\n28:50.300 --> 28:51.220\n The fact that you could,\n\n28:51.220 --> 28:53.020\n so we talk about single player mode a lot,\n\n28:53.020 --> 28:55.380\n which is like, can you play the game alone?\n\n28:56.280 --> 28:57.980\n And Instagram, you could totally play alone.\n\n28:57.980 --> 28:59.380\n You could filter your photos,\n\n28:59.380 --> 29:00.900\n and a lot of people would tell me,\n\n29:00.900 --> 29:04.580\n I didn't even realize that this thing was a social network\n\n29:04.580 --> 29:06.140\n until my friend showed up.\n\n29:06.140 --> 29:09.580\n It totally worked as a single player game.\n\n29:09.580 --> 29:10.940\n And then when your friends showed up,\n\n29:10.940 --> 29:11.780\n all of a sudden it was like,\n\n29:11.780 --> 29:14.100\n oh, not only was this great alone,\n\n29:14.100 --> 29:16.940\n but now I actually have this trove of photos\n\n29:16.940 --> 29:19.380\n that people can look at and start liking,\n\n29:19.380 --> 29:20.500\n and then I can like theirs.\n\n29:20.500 --> 29:23.180\n And so it was this bootstrap method\n\n29:23.180 --> 29:25.180\n of how do you make the thing not suck\n\n29:25.180 --> 29:27.040\n when the restaurant is empty?\n\n29:27.040 --> 29:29.660\n Yeah, but the thing is, when you say friends,\n\n29:29.660 --> 29:31.700\n we're not necessarily referring to friends\n\n29:31.700 --> 29:32.780\n in the physical space.\n\n29:32.780 --> 29:35.340\n So you're not bringing your physical friends with you.\n\n29:35.340 --> 29:36.740\n You're also making new friends.\n\n29:36.740 --> 29:38.380\n So you're finding new community.\n\n29:38.380 --> 29:40.140\n So it's not immediately obvious to me\n\n29:40.140 --> 29:45.020\n that it's almost like building any kind of community.\n\n29:45.020 --> 29:46.540\n It was both.\n\n29:46.540 --> 29:48.620\n And what we learned very early on\n\n29:48.620 --> 29:50.160\n was what made Instagram special\n\n29:50.160 --> 29:51.860\n and the reason why you would sign up for it\n\n29:51.860 --> 29:53.500\n versus say, just sit on Facebook\n\n29:53.500 --> 29:55.820\n and look at your friends photos.\n\n29:55.820 --> 29:56.900\n Of course we were live,\n\n29:56.900 --> 29:58.220\n and of course it was interesting\n\n29:58.220 --> 30:00.340\n to see what your friends were doing now.\n\n30:00.340 --> 30:02.140\n But the fact that you could connect with people\n\n30:02.140 --> 30:05.300\n who like took really beautiful photos in a certain style\n\n30:05.300 --> 30:07.320\n all around the world, whether they were travelers,\n\n30:07.320 --> 30:11.380\n it was the beginning of the influencer economy.\n\n30:11.380 --> 30:12.220\n It was these people\n\n30:12.220 --> 30:14.780\n who became professional Instagrammers way back when.\n\n30:16.660 --> 30:18.800\n But they took these amazing photos\n\n30:18.800 --> 30:23.800\n and some of them were photographers professionally.\n\n30:24.100 --> 30:25.900\n And all of a sudden you had this moment in the day\n\n30:25.900 --> 30:27.140\n when you could open up this app\n\n30:27.140 --> 30:28.900\n and sure you could see what your friends were doing,\n\n30:28.900 --> 30:30.320\n but also it was like, oh my God,\n\n30:30.320 --> 30:33.080\n that's a beautiful waterfall or oh my God,\n\n30:33.080 --> 30:35.100\n I didn't realize there was that corner of England\n\n30:35.100 --> 30:37.220\n or like really cool stuff.\n\n30:38.700 --> 30:40.280\n And the beauty about Instagram early on\n\n30:40.280 --> 30:43.940\n was that it was international by default.\n\n30:43.940 --> 30:46.740\n You didn't have to speak English to use it, right?\n\n30:46.740 --> 30:49.780\n You could just look at the photos, works great.\n\n30:49.780 --> 30:52.360\n We did translate, we had some pretty bad translations,\n\n30:52.360 --> 30:54.420\n but we did translate the app.\n\n30:54.420 --> 30:57.860\n And even if our translations were pretty poor,\n\n30:57.860 --> 31:00.100\n the idea that you could just connect with other people\n\n31:00.100 --> 31:02.280\n through their images was pretty powerful.\n\n31:02.280 --> 31:05.760\n So how much technical difficulties\n\n31:05.760 --> 31:07.120\n there with the programming?\n\n31:07.120 --> 31:09.120\n Like what programming language you were talking about?\n\n31:09.120 --> 31:09.960\n What was?\n\n31:09.960 --> 31:12.040\n Zero, like maybe it was hard for us,\n\n31:12.040 --> 31:16.280\n but I mean, there was nothing.\n\n31:16.280 --> 31:18.700\n The only thing that was complex about Instagram\n\n31:18.700 --> 31:23.680\n at the beginning technically was making it scale.\n\n31:23.680 --> 31:27.920\n We were just plain old Objective C for the client.\n\n31:27.920 --> 31:29.480\n So it was iPhone only at first?\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:30.880\n iPhone only, yep.\n\n31:30.880 --> 31:34.080\n As an Android person, I'm deeply offended, but go ahead.\n\n31:34.080 --> 31:35.880\n This was 2010.\n\n31:35.880 --> 31:36.720\n Oh, sure, sure.\n\n31:36.720 --> 31:37.560\n Sorry, sorry.\n\n31:37.560 --> 31:39.680\n Android's getting a lot better, right?\n\n31:39.680 --> 31:40.960\n So.\n\n31:40.960 --> 31:41.840\n I take it back, you're right.\n\n31:41.840 --> 31:43.160\n If I were to do something today,\n\n31:43.160 --> 31:44.440\n I think it would be very different\n\n31:44.440 --> 31:46.680\n in terms of launch strategy, right?\n\n31:46.680 --> 31:48.280\n Android's enormous too.\n\n31:49.180 --> 31:51.160\n But anyway, back to that moment,\n\n31:51.160 --> 31:56.160\n it was Objective C and then we were Python based,\n\n31:56.920 --> 32:00.220\n which is just like, this is before Python was really cool.\n\n32:00.220 --> 32:01.200\n Like now it's cool\n\n32:01.200 --> 32:03.080\n because it's all these machine learning libraries\n\n32:03.080 --> 32:05.240\n like support Python and right.\n\n32:05.240 --> 32:08.120\n Now it's super, now it's like cool to be Python.\n\n32:08.120 --> 32:10.800\n Back then it was like, oh, Google uses Python.\n\n32:10.800 --> 32:12.600\n Like maybe you should use Python.\n\n32:12.600 --> 32:14.360\n Facebook was PHP.\n\n32:14.360 --> 32:16.760\n Like I had worked at a small startup\n\n32:16.760 --> 32:19.320\n of some ex Googlers that used Python.\n\n32:19.320 --> 32:22.480\n So we used it and we used a framework called Django,\n\n32:22.480 --> 32:27.260\n still exists and people use for basically the backend.\n\n32:27.260 --> 32:30.120\n And then you threw a couple interesting things in there.\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:32.160\n I mean, we used Postgres, which was kind of fun.\n\n32:32.160 --> 32:34.120\n It was a little bit like Hipster database\n\n32:34.120 --> 32:34.960\n at the time, right?\n\n32:34.960 --> 32:36.160\n Versus MySQL.\n\n32:36.160 --> 32:37.920\n MySQL, like everyone used MySQL.\n\n32:37.920 --> 32:40.520\n So like using Postgres was like an interesting decision.\n\n32:40.520 --> 32:42.080\n Right?\n\n32:42.080 --> 32:45.320\n But we used it because it had a bunch of geo features\n\n32:45.320 --> 32:46.840\n built in because we thought we were gonna be\n\n32:46.840 --> 32:47.880\n a check and app, remember?\n\n32:47.880 --> 32:49.280\n It's also super cool now.\n\n32:49.280 --> 32:51.480\n So you were into Python before it was cool\n\n32:51.480 --> 32:53.480\n and you were into Postgres before it was cool.\n\n32:53.480 --> 32:55.060\n Yeah, we were basically like,\n\n32:55.060 --> 32:57.960\n not only Hipster photo company,\n\n32:57.960 --> 33:00.100\n Hipster tech company, right?\n\n33:00.100 --> 33:04.000\n We also adopted Redis early and like loved it.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:06.960\n I mean, it solves so many problems for us\n\n33:06.960 --> 33:09.580\n and turns out that's still pretty cool.\n\n33:09.580 --> 33:11.260\n But the programming was very easy.\n\n33:11.260 --> 33:13.920\n It was like, sign up a user, have a feed.\n\n33:13.920 --> 33:17.440\n There was nothing, no machine learning at all, zero.\n\n33:17.440 --> 33:18.400\n Can you get some context?\n\n33:18.400 --> 33:20.720\n How many users at each of these stages?\n\n33:20.720 --> 33:24.100\n Are we talking about a hundred users, a thousand users?\n\n33:24.100 --> 33:25.640\n So the stage I just described,\n\n33:25.640 --> 33:27.900\n I mean that technical stack lasted\n\n33:27.900 --> 33:30.940\n through probably 50 million users.\n\n33:32.720 --> 33:36.120\n I mean, seriously, like you can get away with a lot\n\n33:36.120 --> 33:38.360\n with a pretty basic stack.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:41.060\n Like I think a lot of startups try to overengineer\n\n33:41.060 --> 33:43.640\n their solutions from the beginning to like really scale\n\n33:43.640 --> 33:45.640\n and you can get away with a lot.\n\n33:45.640 --> 33:48.560\n That being said, most of the first two years of Instagram\n\n33:48.560 --> 33:51.280\n was literally just trying to make that stack scale.\n\n33:51.280 --> 33:54.120\n And it wasn't, it was not a Python problem.\n\n33:54.120 --> 33:58.040\n It was like literally just like, where do we put the data?\n\n33:58.040 --> 33:59.920\n Like it's all coming in too fast.\n\n33:59.920 --> 34:01.000\n Like how do we store it?\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:02.360\n How do we make sure to be up?\n\n34:02.360 --> 34:05.840\n How do we like, how do we make sure we're\n\n34:05.840 --> 34:09.320\n on the right size boxes that they have enough memory?\n\n34:09.320 --> 34:11.200\n Those were the issues, but.\n\n34:11.200 --> 34:14.280\n Can you speak to the choices you make at that stage\n\n34:14.280 --> 34:16.200\n when you're growing so quickly?\n\n34:16.200 --> 34:18.480\n Do you use something like somebody else's\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:22.640\n computer infrastructure or do you build in house?\n\n34:22.640 --> 34:25.640\n I'm only laughing because we, when we launched\n\n34:25.640 --> 34:30.640\n we had a single computer that we had rented\n\n34:30.700 --> 34:32.160\n in some color space in LA.\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:34.720\n I don't even remember what it was called.\n\n34:34.720 --> 34:35.940\n Cause I thought that's what you did.\n\n34:35.940 --> 34:38.520\n When I worked at a company called Odio that became Twitter.\n\n34:38.520 --> 34:41.200\n I remember visiting our space in San Francisco.\n\n34:41.200 --> 34:43.480\n You walked in, you had to wear the ear things.\n\n34:43.480 --> 34:46.880\n It was cold and fans everywhere, right?\n\n34:46.880 --> 34:49.940\n And we had to, you know, plug one out, replace one.\n\n34:49.940 --> 34:52.720\n And I was the intern, so I just like held things.\n\n34:52.720 --> 34:54.960\n But I thought to myself, oh, this is how it goes.\n\n34:54.960 --> 34:57.520\n And then I remember being in a VC's office.\n\n34:58.480 --> 35:00.040\n I think it was a benchmarks office.\n\n35:00.040 --> 35:02.280\n And I think we ran into another entrepreneur\n\n35:02.280 --> 35:03.560\n and they were like, oh, how are things going?\n\n35:03.560 --> 35:06.840\n We're like, ah, you know, try to scale this thing.\n\n35:06.840 --> 35:08.420\n And they were like, well, I mean\n\n35:08.420 --> 35:09.960\n can't you just add more instances?\n\n35:09.960 --> 35:11.540\n And I was like, what do you mean?\n\n35:11.540 --> 35:13.560\n And they're like instances on Amazon.\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:15.520\n I was like, what are those?\n\n35:15.520 --> 35:18.240\n And it was this moment where we realized how deep\n\n35:18.240 --> 35:22.980\n in it we were because we had no idea that AWS existed\n\n35:22.980 --> 35:24.420\n nor should we be using it.\n\n35:24.420 --> 35:27.000\n Anyway, that night we went back to the office\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.840\n and we got on AWS, but we did this really dumb thing.\n\n35:29.840 --> 35:32.960\n We're so sorry to people listening.\n\n35:32.960 --> 35:37.960\n But we brought up an instance, which was our database.\n\n35:38.300 --> 35:40.920\n It's gonna be a replacement for our database.\n\n35:40.920 --> 35:43.720\n But we had it talking over the public internet\n\n35:43.720 --> 35:46.560\n to our little box in LA that was our app server.\n\n35:46.560 --> 35:48.380\n Very nice. Yeah.\n\n35:48.380 --> 35:49.960\n That's how sophisticated we were.\n\n35:49.960 --> 35:51.960\n And obviously that was very, very slow.\n\n35:52.840 --> 35:53.840\n Didn't work at all.\n\n35:53.840 --> 35:55.960\n I mean, it worked, but didn't work.\n\n35:55.960 --> 35:58.080\n Only like later that night did we realize\n\n35:58.080 --> 36:00.160\n we had to have it all together.\n\n36:00.160 --> 36:02.120\n But at least like if you're listening right now\n\n36:02.120 --> 36:04.740\n and you're thinking, you know, I have no chance.\n\n36:04.740 --> 36:06.920\n I'm gonna start to start, but I have no chance.\n\n36:06.920 --> 36:07.760\n I don't know.\n\n36:07.760 --> 36:08.580\n We did it and we made a bunch\n\n36:08.580 --> 36:10.640\n of really dumb mistakes initially.\n\n36:10.640 --> 36:12.540\n I think the question is how quickly do you learn\n\n36:12.540 --> 36:13.560\n that you're making a mistake?\n\n36:13.560 --> 36:16.360\n And do you do the right thing immediately right after?\n\n36:16.360 --> 36:20.320\n So you didn't pay for those mistakes by failure.\n\n36:20.320 --> 36:23.840\n So yeah, how quickly did you fix it?\n\n36:23.840 --> 36:26.280\n I guess there's a lot of ways to sneak up to this question\n\n36:26.280 --> 36:28.440\n of how the hell do you scale the thing?\n\n36:28.440 --> 36:30.360\n Other startups, if you have an idea,\n\n36:30.360 --> 36:31.640\n how do you scale the thing?\n\n36:31.640 --> 36:36.640\n Is it just AWS and you try to write the kind of code\n\n36:37.680 --> 36:41.820\n that's easy to spread across a large number of instances,\n\n36:41.820 --> 36:45.180\n and then the rest is just put money into it?\n\n36:45.180 --> 36:48.860\n Basically, I would say a couple of things.\n\n36:48.860 --> 36:51.580\n First off, don't even ask the question,\n\n36:51.580 --> 36:55.460\n just find product market fit, duct tape it together, right?\n\n36:55.460 --> 36:56.620\n Like if you have to.\n\n36:56.620 --> 36:59.540\n I think there's a big caveat here, which I want to get to,\n\n37:00.400 --> 37:03.800\n but generally all that matters is product market fit.\n\n37:03.800 --> 37:04.860\n That's all that matters.\n\n37:04.860 --> 37:06.880\n If people like your product,\n\n37:06.880 --> 37:10.300\n do not worry about when 50,000 people use your product\n\n37:10.300 --> 37:12.760\n because you will be happy that you have that problem\n\n37:12.760 --> 37:13.920\n when you get there.\n\n37:13.920 --> 37:18.660\n I actually can't name many startups\n\n37:18.660 --> 37:22.100\n where they go from nothing to something overnight\n\n37:22.100 --> 37:24.260\n and they can't figure out how to scale it.\n\n37:24.260 --> 37:27.620\n There are some, but I think nowadays,\n\n37:27.620 --> 37:29.640\n it's a, when I say a solved problem,\n\n37:29.640 --> 37:32.180\n like there are ways of solving it.\n\n37:33.260 --> 37:35.060\n The base case is typically that startups\n\n37:35.060 --> 37:38.000\n worry way too much about scaling way too early\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:39.800\n and forget that they actually have to make something\n\n37:39.800 --> 37:40.640\n that people like.\n\n37:40.640 --> 37:43.740\n That's the default mistake case.\n\n37:43.740 --> 37:48.020\n But what I'll say is once you start scaling,\n\n37:48.020 --> 37:49.820\n I mean, hiring quickly,\n\n37:49.820 --> 37:51.460\n people who have seen the game before\n\n37:51.460 --> 37:52.980\n and just know how to do it,\n\n37:52.980 --> 37:56.660\n it becomes a bit of like, yeah,\n\n37:56.660 --> 37:59.340\n just throw instances of the problem, right?\n\n37:59.340 --> 38:00.740\n But the last thing I'll say on this\n\n38:00.740 --> 38:02.300\n that I think did save us,\n\n38:03.420 --> 38:06.700\n we were pretty rigorous about writing tests\n\n38:06.700 --> 38:07.620\n from the beginning.\n\n38:08.560 --> 38:11.420\n That helped us move very, very quickly\n\n38:11.420 --> 38:14.620\n when we wanted to rewrite parts of the product\n\n38:14.620 --> 38:17.260\n and know that we weren't breaking something else.\n\n38:17.260 --> 38:18.700\n Tests are one of those things where it's like,\n\n38:18.700 --> 38:20.660\n you go slow to go fast.\n\n38:20.660 --> 38:22.940\n And they suck when you have to write them\n\n38:22.940 --> 38:24.180\n because you have to figure it out.\n\n38:24.180 --> 38:27.000\n And there are always those ones that break\n\n38:27.000 --> 38:29.060\n when you don't want them to break and they're annoying\n\n38:29.060 --> 38:30.420\n and it feels like you spent all this time.\n\n38:30.420 --> 38:34.740\n But looking back, I think that like longterm optimal,\n\n38:34.740 --> 38:36.900\n even with a team of four,\n\n38:36.900 --> 38:38.780\n it allowed us to move very, very quickly\n\n38:38.780 --> 38:41.940\n because anyone could touch any part of the product\n\n38:41.940 --> 38:44.440\n and know that they weren't gonna bring down the site,\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:45.900\n or at least in general.\n\n38:45.900 --> 38:48.660\n At which point do you know product market fit?\n\n38:48.660 --> 38:50.540\n How many users would you say?\n\n38:50.540 --> 38:52.540\n Is it all it takes is like 10 people?\n\n38:52.540 --> 38:53.780\n Or is it a thousand?\n\n38:53.780 --> 38:55.820\n Is it 50,000?\n\n38:55.820 --> 38:58.220\n I don't think it is generally\n\n38:58.220 --> 38:59.880\n a question of absolute numbers.\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:01.860\n I think it's a question of cohorts\n\n39:01.860 --> 39:03.900\n and I think it's a question of trends.\n\n39:03.900 --> 39:08.780\n So, you know, it depends how big your business is trying\n\n39:08.780 --> 39:09.620\n to be, right?\n\n39:09.620 --> 39:12.260\n But if I were signing up a thousand people a week\n\n39:12.260 --> 39:14.100\n and they all retain,\n\n39:14.100 --> 39:16.980\n like the retention curves for those cohorts looked good,\n\n39:16.980 --> 39:19.740\n healthy, and even like,\n\n39:19.740 --> 39:21.940\n as you started getting more people on the service,\n\n39:21.940 --> 39:24.660\n maybe those earlier cohorts started curving up again\n\n39:24.660 --> 39:26.060\n because now there are network effects\n\n39:26.060 --> 39:27.380\n and their friends are on the service\n\n39:27.380 --> 39:29.860\n or totally depends what type of business you're in,\n\n39:29.860 --> 39:34.060\n but I'm talking purely social, right?\n\n39:34.060 --> 39:36.580\n I don't think it's an absolute number.\n\n39:36.580 --> 39:37.900\n I think it is,\n\n39:37.900 --> 39:39.660\n I guess you could call it a marginal number.\n\n39:39.660 --> 39:42.340\n So I spent a lot of time when I work with startups\n\n39:42.340 --> 39:44.380\n asking them like, okay,\n\n39:44.380 --> 39:47.260\n have you looked at that cohort versus this cohort,\n\n39:47.260 --> 39:48.500\n whether it's your clients\n\n39:48.500 --> 39:52.300\n or whether it's people signing up for the service?\n\n39:52.300 --> 39:55.180\n But a lot of people think you just have to hit some mark,\n\n39:55.180 --> 39:57.780\n like 10,000 people or 50,000 people,\n\n39:57.780 --> 40:01.980\n but really seven ish billion people in the world.\n\n40:01.980 --> 40:05.300\n Most people forever will not know about your product.\n\n40:05.300 --> 40:07.860\n There are always more people out there to sign up.\n\n40:07.860 --> 40:11.380\n It's just a question of how you turn on the spigot, so.\n\n40:11.380 --> 40:14.940\n At that stage, early stage yourself,\n\n40:14.940 --> 40:16.700\n but also by way of advice,\n\n40:16.700 --> 40:18.220\n should you worry about money at all?\n\n40:18.220 --> 40:20.340\n How this thing's gonna make money?\n\n40:20.340 --> 40:24.300\n Or do you just try to find product market fit\n\n40:24.300 --> 40:27.780\n and get a lot of users to enjoy using your thing?\n\n40:28.660 --> 40:30.020\n I think it totally depends.\n\n40:30.020 --> 40:32.620\n And that's an unsatisfying answer.\n\n40:32.620 --> 40:35.420\n I was talking with a friend today who,\n\n40:36.460 --> 40:39.100\n he was one of our earlier investors and he was saying,\n\n40:39.100 --> 40:41.580\n hey, like, have you been doing any angel investing lately?\n\n40:41.580 --> 40:42.540\n I said, not really.\n\n40:42.540 --> 40:44.780\n I'm just like focused on what I wanna do next.\n\n40:44.780 --> 40:49.780\n And he said, the number of financings have just gone bonkers.\n\n40:49.780 --> 40:54.460\n Like people are throwing money everywhere right now.\n\n40:56.340 --> 41:00.580\n And I think the question is,\n\n41:00.580 --> 41:04.140\n do you have an inkling of how you're gonna make money?\n\n41:04.140 --> 41:07.420\n Or are you really just like waving your hands?\n\n41:07.420 --> 41:11.460\n I would not like to be an entrepreneur in the position of,\n\n41:11.460 --> 41:14.420\n well, I have no idea how this will eventually make money.\n\n41:14.420 --> 41:15.260\n That's not fun.\n\n41:16.980 --> 41:18.740\n If you are in an area,\n\n41:18.740 --> 41:22.900\n like let's say you wanted to start a social network, right?\n\n41:22.900 --> 41:25.900\n Not saying this is a good idea, but if you did,\n\n41:25.900 --> 41:27.780\n there are only a handful of ways they've made money\n\n41:27.780 --> 41:29.820\n and really only one way they've made money in the past\n\n41:29.820 --> 41:30.900\n and that's ads.\n\n41:31.780 --> 41:36.780\n So, if you have a service that's amenable to that\n\n41:37.300 --> 41:39.780\n and then I wouldn't worry too much about that\n\n41:39.780 --> 41:40.900\n because if you get to the scale,\n\n41:40.900 --> 41:44.220\n you can hire some smart people and figure that out.\n\n41:44.220 --> 41:48.620\n I do think that is really healthy for a lot of startups\n\n41:48.620 --> 41:50.260\n these days, especially the ones doing\n\n41:50.260 --> 41:54.820\n like enterprise software, slacks of the world, et cetera,\n\n41:54.820 --> 41:56.660\n to be worried about money from the beginning,\n\n41:56.660 --> 42:00.180\n but mostly as a way of winning over clients\n\n42:00.180 --> 42:01.580\n and having stickiness.\n\n42:05.500 --> 42:06.940\n Of course you need to be worried about money,\n\n42:06.940 --> 42:08.620\n but I'm gonna also say this again,\n\n42:08.620 --> 42:12.100\n which is it's like longterm profitability.\n\n42:12.100 --> 42:15.860\n If you have a roadmap to that, then that's great.\n\n42:15.860 --> 42:18.100\n But if you're just like, I don't know, maybe never,\n\n42:18.100 --> 42:19.860\n like we're working on this metaverse thing,\n\n42:19.860 --> 42:22.900\n I think maybe someday, I don't know.\n\n42:22.900 --> 42:24.700\n Like that seems harder to me.\n\n42:24.700 --> 42:26.740\n So you have to be as big as Facebook\n\n42:26.740 --> 42:29.420\n to like finance that bet, right?\n\n42:29.420 --> 42:31.180\n Do you think it's possible, you said,\n\n42:31.180 --> 42:33.380\n you're not saying it's necessarily a good idea\n\n42:33.380 --> 42:35.260\n to launch a social network.\n\n42:35.260 --> 42:38.980\n Do you think it's possible today,\n\n42:38.980 --> 42:41.260\n maybe you can put yourself in those shoes,\n\n42:41.260 --> 42:45.420\n to launch a social network that achieves the scale\n\n42:45.420 --> 42:49.500\n of a Facebook or a Twitter or an Instagram,\n\n42:49.500 --> 42:51.300\n and maybe even greater scale?\n\n42:51.300 --> 42:52.140\n Absolutely.\n\n42:53.300 --> 42:54.180\n How do you do it?\n\n42:55.460 --> 42:56.380\n Asking for a friend.\n\n42:56.380 --> 42:59.020\n Yeah, if I knew, I'd probably be doing it right now\n\n42:59.020 --> 43:00.060\n and not sitting here.\n\n43:00.940 --> 43:03.580\n So, I mean, there's a lot of ways to ask this question.\n\n43:03.580 --> 43:07.220\n One is create a totally new product market fit,\n\n43:07.220 --> 43:10.300\n create a new market, create something like Instagram did,\n\n43:10.300 --> 43:13.100\n which is like create something kind of new,\n\n43:13.100 --> 43:17.060\n or literally out compete Facebook at its own thing,\n\n43:17.060 --> 43:19.820\n or I'll compete Twitter at its own thing.\n\n43:19.820 --> 43:21.500\n The only way to compete now,\n\n43:21.500 --> 43:23.780\n if you wanna build a large social network\n\n43:23.780 --> 43:26.820\n is to look for the cracks, look for the openings.\n\n43:28.980 --> 43:31.340\n No one competed, I mean,\n\n43:31.340 --> 43:33.420\n no one competed with the core business of Google.\n\n43:33.420 --> 43:36.860\n No one competed with the core business of Microsoft.\n\n43:36.860 --> 43:39.380\n You don't go at the big guys\n\n43:39.380 --> 43:41.860\n doing exactly what they're doing.\n\n43:41.860 --> 43:43.900\n Instagram didn't win, quote unquote,\n\n43:43.900 --> 43:46.940\n because it tried to be a visual Twitter.\n\n43:46.940 --> 43:49.980\n Like we spotted things that either Twitter\n\n43:49.980 --> 43:52.820\n wasn't going to do or refuse to do,\n\n43:52.820 --> 43:55.980\n images and feed for the longest time, right?\n\n43:55.980 --> 43:58.540\n Or that Facebook wasn't doing or not paying attention to\n\n43:58.540 --> 44:00.620\n because they were mostly desktop at the time\n\n44:00.620 --> 44:03.700\n and we were purely mobile, purely visual.\n\n44:05.060 --> 44:07.620\n Often there are opportunities sitting there.\n\n44:07.620 --> 44:12.020\n You have to figure out like,\n\n44:12.020 --> 44:13.860\n I think like there's a strategy book,\n\n44:13.860 --> 44:14.780\n I can't remember the name,\n\n44:14.780 --> 44:19.700\n but talk about moats and just like the best place to play\n\n44:19.700 --> 44:22.220\n is where your competitor literally can't pivot\n\n44:22.220 --> 44:26.060\n because structurally they're set up not to be there.\n\n44:26.060 --> 44:28.100\n And that's where you win.\n\n44:28.100 --> 44:30.460\n And what's fascinating is like,\n\n44:30.460 --> 44:31.980\n do you know how many people were like,\n\n44:31.980 --> 44:35.260\n images, Facebook does that, Twitter does that.\n\n44:35.260 --> 44:37.220\n I mean, how wrong were they, really wrong?\n\n44:37.220 --> 44:38.580\n And these are some of the smartest people\n\n44:38.580 --> 44:40.420\n in Silicon Valley, right?\n\n44:40.420 --> 44:42.740\n But now Instagram exists for a while.\n\n44:42.740 --> 44:45.220\n How is it that Snapchat could then exist?\n\n44:45.220 --> 44:47.300\n It makes no sense.\n\n44:47.300 --> 44:48.720\n Like plenty of people would say,\n\n44:48.720 --> 44:50.140\n well, there's Facebook, no images.\n\n44:50.140 --> 44:52.820\n Okay, okay, Instagram, I'll give you that one.\n\n44:52.820 --> 44:55.260\n But wait, now another image based social network\n\n44:55.260 --> 44:57.140\n is gonna get really big.\n\n44:57.140 --> 44:58.780\n And then TikTok comes along.\n\n44:59.980 --> 45:03.500\n Like the prior, so you asked me, is it possible?\n\n45:03.500 --> 45:05.700\n The only reason I'm answering yes\n\n45:05.700 --> 45:09.620\n is because my prior is that it's happened once every,\n\n45:09.620 --> 45:13.020\n I don't know, three, four or five years consistently.\n\n45:13.020 --> 45:15.340\n And I can't imagine there's anything structurally\n\n45:15.340 --> 45:16.660\n that would change that.\n\n45:17.620 --> 45:18.980\n So that's why I answer that way.\n\n45:18.980 --> 45:21.260\n Not because I know how, I just,\n\n45:21.260 --> 45:22.900\n when you see a pattern, you see a pattern\n\n45:22.900 --> 45:25.580\n and there's no reason to believe that's gonna stop.\n\n45:25.580 --> 45:27.780\n And it's subtle too, because like you said,\n\n45:27.780 --> 45:29.720\n Snapchat and TikTok,\n\n45:29.720 --> 45:32.660\n they're all doing the same space of things,\n\n45:32.660 --> 45:34.820\n but there's something fundamentally different\n\n45:34.820 --> 45:38.740\n about like a three second video and a five second video\n\n45:38.740 --> 45:41.020\n and a 15 second video and a one minute video\n\n45:41.020 --> 45:43.900\n and a one hour video, like fundamentally different.\n\n45:43.900 --> 45:45.020\n Fundamentally different.\n\n45:45.020 --> 45:48.260\n I mean, I think one of the reasons Snapchat exists\n\n45:48.260 --> 45:51.660\n is because Instagram was so focused on posting great,\n\n45:51.660 --> 45:56.660\n beautiful manicured versions of yourself throughout time.\n\n45:57.180 --> 45:58.780\n And there was this enormous demand of like,\n\n45:58.780 --> 46:00.740\n hey, I really like this behavior.\n\n46:00.740 --> 46:03.400\n I love using Instagram, but man,\n\n46:03.400 --> 46:06.720\n I just like wish I could share something going on in my day.\n\n46:07.940 --> 46:10.000\n Do I really have to put it on my profile?\n\n46:10.000 --> 46:11.900\n Do I really have to make it last forever?\n\n46:11.900 --> 46:14.680\n Do I really, and that opened up a door,\n\n46:14.680 --> 46:16.660\n it created a market, right?\n\n46:16.660 --> 46:20.460\n And then what's fascinating is Instagram had an explore page\n\n46:20.460 --> 46:23.740\n for the longest time and it was image driven, right?\n\n46:23.740 --> 46:26.780\n But there's absolutely a behavior where you open up Instagram\n\n46:26.780 --> 46:28.340\n and you sit on the explore page all day.\n\n46:28.340 --> 46:29.900\n That is effectively TikTok,\n\n46:29.900 --> 46:32.540\n but obviously focused on videos.\n\n46:32.540 --> 46:35.420\n And it's not like you could just put the explore page\n\n46:35.420 --> 46:37.140\n in TikTok form and it works.\n\n46:37.140 --> 46:39.740\n It had to be video, it had to have music.\n\n46:39.740 --> 46:42.380\n These are the hard parts about product development\n\n46:42.380 --> 46:44.180\n that are very hard to predict,\n\n46:44.180 --> 46:47.940\n but they're all versions of the same thing\n\n46:47.940 --> 46:50.980\n with varying, like if you line them up\n\n46:50.980 --> 46:54.300\n in a bunch of dimensions, they're just like kind of on,\n\n46:55.180 --> 46:56.980\n they're different values of the same dimensions,\n\n46:56.980 --> 46:59.680\n which is like, I guess, easy to say in retrospect.\n\n46:59.680 --> 47:02.580\n But like, if I were an entrepreneur going after that area,\n\n47:02.580 --> 47:05.140\n I'd ask myself like, where's the opening?\n\n47:05.140 --> 47:08.500\n What needs to exist because TikTok exists now?\n\n47:08.500 --> 47:13.060\n So I wonder how much things that don't yet exist\n\n47:13.060 --> 47:15.880\n and can exist is in the space of algorithms,\n\n47:15.880 --> 47:18.020\n in the space of recommender systems.\n\n47:18.020 --> 47:21.680\n So in the space of how the feed is generated.\n\n47:21.680 --> 47:24.180\n So we kind of talk about the actual elements\n\n47:24.180 --> 47:27.900\n of the content, that's what we've been talking,\n\n47:27.900 --> 47:29.840\n the difference between photos,\n\n47:29.840 --> 47:32.440\n between short videos, longer videos.\n\n47:32.440 --> 47:35.140\n I wonder how much disruption is possible\n\n47:35.140 --> 47:37.260\n in the way the algorithms work.\n\n47:37.260 --> 47:39.540\n Because a lot of the criticism towards social media\n\n47:39.540 --> 47:41.900\n is in the way the algorithms work currently.\n\n47:41.900 --> 47:44.620\n And it feels like, first of all,\n\n47:44.620 --> 47:47.340\n talking about product market fit,\n\n47:47.340 --> 47:52.340\n there's certainly a hunger for social media algorithms\n\n47:54.420 --> 47:56.860\n that do something different.\n\n47:56.860 --> 47:59.580\n I don't think anyone, everyone said complaining,\n\n47:59.580 --> 48:04.180\n this is hurting me and this is hurting society,\n\n48:04.180 --> 48:07.380\n but I keep doing it because I'm addicted to it.\n\n48:07.380 --> 48:09.940\n And they say, we want something different,\n\n48:09.940 --> 48:11.380\n but we don't know what.\n\n48:11.380 --> 48:15.300\n It feels like just different.\n\n48:15.300 --> 48:17.740\n It feels like there's a hunger for that,\n\n48:17.740 --> 48:19.300\n but that's in the space of algorithms.\n\n48:19.300 --> 48:22.020\n I wonder if it's possible to disrupt in that space.\n\n48:22.020 --> 48:27.020\n Absolutely, I have this thesis that the worst part\n\n48:27.860 --> 48:32.860\n about social networks is that they're, is the people.\n\n48:33.740 --> 48:36.660\n It's a line that sounds funny, right?\n\n48:36.660 --> 48:39.660\n Because like, that's why you call it a social network.\n\n48:39.660 --> 48:42.420\n But what does social networks actually do for you?\n\n48:42.420 --> 48:45.740\n Like just think, like imagine you were an alien\n\n48:45.740 --> 48:47.460\n and you landed and someone says,\n\n48:47.460 --> 48:49.460\n hey, there's this site, it's a social network.\n\n48:49.460 --> 48:50.400\n We're not gonna tell you what it is,\n\n48:50.400 --> 48:51.860\n but just what does it do?\n\n48:51.860 --> 48:53.140\n And you have to explain it to them.\n\n48:53.140 --> 48:54.340\n It does two things.\n\n48:54.340 --> 48:59.020\n One is that people you know and have social ties with\n\n49:00.220 --> 49:05.220\n distribute updates through whether it's photos or videos\n\n49:05.940 --> 49:07.820\n about their lives so that you don't have to physically\n\n49:07.820 --> 49:09.860\n be with them, but you can keep in touch with them.\n\n49:09.860 --> 49:12.260\n That's one, that's like a big part of Instagram.\n\n49:12.260 --> 49:14.020\n That's a big part of Snap.\n\n49:14.020 --> 49:16.300\n It is not part of TikTok at all.\n\n49:16.300 --> 49:19.700\n So there's another big part, which is there's all this\n\n49:19.700 --> 49:22.420\n content out in the world that's entertaining,\n\n49:22.420 --> 49:25.140\n whether you wanna watch it or you wanna read it.\n\n49:26.860 --> 49:30.340\n And matchmaking between content that exists in the world\n\n49:30.340 --> 49:33.460\n and people that want that content\n\n49:33.460 --> 49:35.980\n turns out to be like a really big business, right?\n\n49:35.980 --> 49:37.260\n Search and discovery, which you?\n\n49:37.260 --> 49:39.940\n Search and discovery, but my point is it could be video,\n\n49:39.940 --> 49:42.020\n it could be text, it could be websites, it could be,\n\n49:42.020 --> 49:46.580\n I mean, think back to like dig, right?\n\n49:46.580 --> 49:49.260\n Or stumble upon or, right?\n\n49:49.260 --> 49:50.620\n Nice, yeah.\n\n49:50.620 --> 49:51.820\n But like, what did those do?\n\n49:51.820 --> 49:54.340\n Like they basically distributed interesting content\n\n49:54.340 --> 49:55.460\n to you, right?\n\n49:57.500 --> 50:00.740\n I think the most interesting part or the future\n\n50:00.740 --> 50:03.540\n of social networks is going to be making them less social\n\n50:03.540 --> 50:06.340\n because I think people are part of the root cause\n\n50:06.340 --> 50:07.180\n of the problem.\n\n50:07.180 --> 50:10.340\n So for instance, often in recommender systems,\n\n50:10.340 --> 50:11.500\n we talk about two stages.\n\n50:11.500 --> 50:14.500\n There's a candidate generation step, which is just like\n\n50:14.500 --> 50:18.380\n of our vast trove of stuff that you might wanna see,\n\n50:18.380 --> 50:23.060\n what small subset should we pick for you, okay?\n\n50:24.020 --> 50:25.900\n Typically that is grabbed from things\n\n50:25.900 --> 50:28.380\n your friends have shared, right?\n\n50:28.380 --> 50:30.820\n Then there's a ranking step which says, okay,\n\n50:30.820 --> 50:33.580\n now given these 100, 200 things depends on the network,\n\n50:33.580 --> 50:34.420\n right?\n\n50:34.420 --> 50:36.460\n Let's like be really good about ranking them\n\n50:36.460 --> 50:38.940\n and generally rank the things up higher\n\n50:38.940 --> 50:40.820\n that get the most engagement, right?\n\n50:40.820 --> 50:42.540\n So what's the problem with that?\n\n50:42.540 --> 50:46.860\n Step one is we've limited everything you could possibly see\n\n50:46.860 --> 50:49.540\n to things that your friends have chosen to share\n\n50:49.540 --> 50:52.300\n or maybe not friends, but influencers.\n\n50:52.300 --> 50:54.580\n What things do people generally want to share?\n\n50:54.580 --> 50:56.340\n They wanna share things that are gonna get likes,\n\n50:56.340 --> 50:58.660\n that are gonna show up broadly.\n\n50:58.660 --> 51:00.740\n So they tend to be more emotionally driven.\n\n51:00.740 --> 51:03.820\n They tend to be more risque or whatever.\n\n51:03.820 --> 51:05.140\n So why do we have this problem?\n\n51:05.140 --> 51:08.980\n It's because we show people things people have decided\n\n51:08.980 --> 51:11.660\n to share and those things self select to being the things\n\n51:11.660 --> 51:14.060\n that are most divisive.\n\n51:14.060 --> 51:15.540\n So how do you fix that?\n\n51:15.540 --> 51:20.140\n Well, what if you just imagine for a second\n\n51:20.140 --> 51:21.620\n that why do you have to grab things\n\n51:21.620 --> 51:23.140\n from things your friends have shared?\n\n51:23.140 --> 51:25.420\n Why not just like grab things?\n\n51:25.420 --> 51:27.420\n That's really fascinating to me.\n\n51:27.420 --> 51:29.100\n And that's something I've been thinking a lot about.\n\n51:29.100 --> 51:34.100\n And just like, why is it that when you log onto Twitter,\n\n51:34.940 --> 51:38.940\n you're just sitting there looking at things from accounts\n\n51:38.940 --> 51:40.980\n that you've followed for whatever reason?\n\n51:42.300 --> 51:44.460\n And TikTok I think has done a wonderful job here,\n\n51:44.460 --> 51:47.180\n which is like, you can literally be anyone.\n\n51:47.180 --> 51:51.700\n And if you produce something fascinating, it'll go viral.\n\n51:51.700 --> 51:54.780\n But like, you don't have to be someone that anyone knows.\n\n51:54.780 --> 51:57.300\n You don't have to have built up a giant following.\n\n51:57.300 --> 52:00.060\n You don't have to have paid for followers.\n\n52:00.060 --> 52:01.860\n You don't have to try to maintain those followers.\n\n52:01.860 --> 52:04.620\n You literally just have to produce something interesting.\n\n52:04.620 --> 52:07.260\n That is I think the future of social networking.\n\n52:07.260 --> 52:10.020\n That's the direction things will head.\n\n52:10.020 --> 52:12.540\n And I think what you'll find is it's far less\n\n52:12.540 --> 52:15.860\n about people manipulating distribution\n\n52:15.860 --> 52:18.780\n and far more about what is like, is this content good?\n\n52:19.660 --> 52:22.420\n And good is obviously a vague definition\n\n52:22.420 --> 52:23.700\n that we could spend hours on.\n\n52:23.700 --> 52:27.140\n But different networks I think will decide\n\n52:27.140 --> 52:29.300\n different value functions to decide what is good\n\n52:29.300 --> 52:30.140\n and what isn't good.\n\n52:30.140 --> 52:32.100\n And I think that's a fascinating direction.\n\n52:32.100 --> 52:33.620\n So that's almost like creating an internet.\n\n52:33.620 --> 52:36.180\n I mean, that's what Google did for web pages\n\n52:36.180 --> 52:39.380\n that did page rank search.\n\n52:39.380 --> 52:42.660\n So it's discovery, you don't follow anybody on Google\n\n52:42.660 --> 52:44.380\n when you use a search engine.\n\n52:44.380 --> 52:46.260\n You just discover web pages.\n\n52:46.260 --> 52:49.780\n And so what TikTok does is saying,\n\n52:49.780 --> 52:51.740\n let's start from scratch.\n\n52:51.740 --> 52:54.540\n Let's like start a new internet\n\n52:54.540 --> 52:56.820\n and have people discover stuff on that new internet\n\n52:56.820 --> 52:59.820\n within a particular kind of pool of people.\n\n52:59.820 --> 53:01.300\n But what's so fascinating about this\n\n53:01.300 --> 53:05.140\n is like the field of information retrieval.\n\n53:05.140 --> 53:08.460\n Like I always talked about as I was studying this stuff,\n\n53:08.460 --> 53:10.500\n it was used the word query and document.\n\n53:10.500 --> 53:12.860\n So I was like, why are they saying query and documents?\n\n53:12.860 --> 53:14.660\n Like they're literally imagine,\n\n53:14.660 --> 53:17.060\n like if you just stop thinking about query\n\n53:17.060 --> 53:18.900\n as like literally a search query\n\n53:18.900 --> 53:20.460\n and a query could be a person.\n\n53:20.460 --> 53:22.100\n I mean, a lot of the way,\n\n53:22.100 --> 53:24.220\n I'm not gonna claim to know how Instagram or Facebook\n\n53:24.220 --> 53:26.140\n machine learning works today,\n\n53:26.140 --> 53:30.300\n but if you want to find a match for a query,\n\n53:30.300 --> 53:33.260\n the query is actually the attributes of the person,\n\n53:33.260 --> 53:36.740\n their age, their gender, where they're from,\n\n53:36.740 --> 53:39.740\n maybe some kind of summarization of their interests.\n\n53:39.740 --> 53:41.980\n And that's a query, right?\n\n53:41.980 --> 53:43.460\n And that matches against documents.\n\n53:43.460 --> 53:45.100\n And by the way, documents don't have to be texts.\n\n53:45.100 --> 53:48.180\n They can be videos, however long.\n\n53:48.180 --> 53:50.140\n I don't know what the limit is on TikTok these days.\n\n53:50.140 --> 53:51.340\n They keep changing it.\n\n53:51.340 --> 53:53.380\n My point is just, you've got a query,\n\n53:53.380 --> 53:55.260\n which is someone in search of something\n\n53:55.260 --> 53:58.260\n that they want to match and you've got the document\n\n53:58.260 --> 53:59.460\n and it doesn't have to be text.\n\n53:59.460 --> 54:00.700\n It could be anything.\n\n54:00.700 --> 54:02.060\n And how do you match make?\n\n54:02.060 --> 54:03.220\n And that's one of these like,\n\n54:03.220 --> 54:06.220\n I mean, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this\n\n54:06.220 --> 54:08.820\n and I don't claim to have mastered it at all,\n\n54:08.820 --> 54:11.700\n but I think it's so fascinating about where that will go\n\n54:11.700 --> 54:13.300\n with new social networks.\n\n54:13.300 --> 54:16.060\n See, what I'm also fascinated by is metrics\n\n54:16.060 --> 54:18.140\n that are different than engagement.\n\n54:18.140 --> 54:20.900\n So the other thing from an alien perspective,\n\n54:20.900 --> 54:23.820\n what social networks are doing is they,\n\n54:25.420 --> 54:26.780\n they in the short term,\n\n54:26.780 --> 54:30.100\n bring out different aspects of each human being.\n\n54:30.100 --> 54:38.580\n So first, let me say that an algorithm or a social network\n\n54:38.580 --> 54:41.780\n for each individual can bring out the best of that person\n\n54:41.780 --> 54:43.380\n or the worst of that person,\n\n54:43.380 --> 54:45.620\n or there's a bunch of different parts to us,\n\n54:45.620 --> 54:48.780\n parts we're proud of that we are,\n\n54:48.780 --> 54:50.780\n parts we're not so proud of.\n\n54:50.780 --> 54:53.100\n When we look at the big picture of our lives,\n\n54:53.100 --> 54:55.140\n when we look back 30 days from now,\n\n54:55.140 --> 54:57.580\n am I proud that I said those things or not?\n\n54:57.580 --> 54:59.260\n Am I proud that I felt those things?\n\n54:59.260 --> 55:02.820\n Am I proud that I experienced or read those things\n\n55:02.820 --> 55:04.780\n or thought about those things?\n\n55:04.780 --> 55:08.060\n Just in that kind of self reflected kind of way.\n\n55:08.060 --> 55:10.180\n And so coupled with that,\n\n55:10.180 --> 55:12.220\n I wonder if it's possible to have different metrics\n\n55:12.220 --> 55:14.100\n that are not just about engagement,\n\n55:14.100 --> 55:18.860\n but are about long term happiness,\n\n55:18.860 --> 55:20.260\n growth of a human being,\n\n55:20.260 --> 55:22.220\n where they look back and say,\n\n55:22.220 --> 55:23.700\n I am a better human being\n\n55:23.700 --> 55:26.860\n for having spent 100 hours on that app.\n\n55:26.860 --> 55:30.580\n And that feels like it's actually strongly correlated\n\n55:30.580 --> 55:33.300\n with engagement in the long term.\n\n55:33.300 --> 55:34.740\n In the short term, it may not be,\n\n55:34.740 --> 55:37.820\n but in long term, it's like the same kind of thing\n\n55:37.820 --> 55:40.580\n where you really fall in love with the product.\n\n55:40.580 --> 55:41.980\n You fall in love with an iPhone,\n\n55:41.980 --> 55:43.780\n you fall in love with a car.\n\n55:43.780 --> 55:45.060\n That's what makes you fall in love\n\n55:45.060 --> 55:49.260\n is like really being proud\n\n55:49.260 --> 55:51.580\n and just in a self reflected way,\n\n55:51.580 --> 55:53.620\n understanding that you're a better human being\n\n55:53.620 --> 55:55.020\n for having used the thing.\n\n55:55.020 --> 55:58.780\n And that's what great relationships are made from.\n\n55:58.780 --> 56:01.660\n It's not just like you're hot\n\n56:01.660 --> 56:04.340\n and we like being together or something like that.\n\n56:04.340 --> 56:06.100\n It's more like I'm a better human being\n\n56:06.100 --> 56:07.620\n because I'm with you.\n\n56:07.620 --> 56:09.300\n And that feels like a metric\n\n56:09.300 --> 56:12.180\n that could be optimized for by the algorithms.\n\n56:13.060 --> 56:17.140\n But anytime I kind of talk about this with anybody,\n\n56:17.140 --> 56:18.620\n they seem to say, yeah, okay,\n\n56:18.620 --> 56:21.060\n that's going to get out competed immediately\n\n56:21.060 --> 56:24.700\n by the engagement if it's ad driven especially.\n\n56:24.700 --> 56:26.540\n I just don't think so.\n\n56:26.540 --> 56:30.700\n I don't, I mean, a lot of it's just implementation.\n\n56:30.700 --> 56:31.660\n I'll say a couple of things.\n\n56:31.660 --> 56:36.660\n One is to pull back the curtain on daily meetings\n\n56:36.900 --> 56:39.220\n inside of these large social media companies.\n\n56:40.380 --> 56:42.900\n A lot of what management,\n\n56:42.900 --> 56:45.700\n or at least the people that are tweaking these algorithms\n\n56:45.700 --> 56:47.900\n spend their time on are trade offs.\n\n56:47.900 --> 56:50.100\n And there's these things called value functions,\n\n56:50.100 --> 56:51.940\n which are like, okay,\n\n56:51.940 --> 56:54.780\n we can predict the probability that you'll click\n\n56:54.780 --> 56:58.260\n on this thing or the probability that you'll share it,\n\n56:58.260 --> 57:01.180\n or the probability that you will leave a comment on it\n\n57:01.180 --> 57:03.540\n or the probability you'll dwell on it.\n\n57:04.660 --> 57:06.340\n Individual actions, right?\n\n57:07.300 --> 57:09.460\n And you've got this neural network\n\n57:09.460 --> 57:11.420\n that basically has a bunch of heads at the end\n\n57:11.420 --> 57:14.900\n and all of them are between zero and one and great.\n\n57:14.900 --> 57:15.980\n They all have values, right?\n\n57:15.980 --> 57:18.260\n Or they all have probabilities.\n\n57:19.780 --> 57:21.580\n And then in these meetings, what they will do is say,\n\n57:21.580 --> 57:26.580\n well, how much do we value a comment versus a click\n\n57:26.780 --> 57:29.180\n versus a share versus a,\n\n57:29.180 --> 57:31.940\n and then maybe even some downstream thing, right?\n\n57:31.940 --> 57:34.100\n That has nothing to do with the item there,\n\n57:34.100 --> 57:37.540\n but like driving follows or something.\n\n57:37.540 --> 57:40.180\n And what typically happens is they will say,\n\n57:40.180 --> 57:42.740\n well, what are our goals for this quarter at the company?\n\n57:42.740 --> 57:44.740\n Oh, we wanna drive sharing up, okay.\n\n57:44.740 --> 57:46.780\n Well, let's turn down these metrics\n\n57:46.780 --> 57:48.660\n and turn up these metrics.\n\n57:48.660 --> 57:52.380\n And they blend them right into a single scalar\n\n57:52.380 --> 57:53.980\n which they're trying to optimize.\n\n57:55.260 --> 57:58.140\n That is really hard because invariably\n\n57:58.140 --> 57:59.860\n you think you're solving for, I don't know,\n\n57:59.860 --> 58:02.780\n something called meaningful interactions, right?\n\n58:02.780 --> 58:04.180\n This was the big Facebook pivot.\n\n58:04.180 --> 58:06.700\n And I don't actually have any internal knowledge.\n\n58:06.700 --> 58:09.060\n Like I wasn't in those meetings,\n\n58:09.060 --> 58:12.900\n but at least from what we've seen over the last month or so,\n\n58:12.900 --> 58:16.460\n it seems by actually trying to optimize\n\n58:16.460 --> 58:18.140\n for meaningful interactions,\n\n58:18.140 --> 58:20.100\n it had all these side effects of optimizing\n\n58:20.100 --> 58:22.100\n for these other things.\n\n58:22.100 --> 58:24.580\n And I don't claim to fully understand them,\n\n58:24.580 --> 58:28.780\n but what I will say is that trade offs abound.\n\n58:28.780 --> 58:31.740\n And as much as you'd like to solve for one thing,\n\n58:31.740 --> 58:34.700\n if you have a network of over a billion people,\n\n58:34.700 --> 58:36.700\n you're gonna have unintended consequences either way.\n\n58:36.700 --> 58:38.860\n And it gets really hard.\n\n58:38.860 --> 58:41.420\n So what you're describing is effectively a value model\n\n58:41.420 --> 58:43.420\n that says like, can we capture,\n\n58:43.420 --> 58:45.620\n this is the thing that I spent a lot of time thinking about,\n\n58:45.620 --> 58:48.660\n like, can you capture utility\n\n58:49.940 --> 58:53.580\n in a way that like actually measures someone's happiness\n\n58:53.580 --> 58:56.660\n that isn't just a, what do they call it?\n\n58:56.660 --> 58:59.100\n A surrogate problem where you say, well,\n\n58:59.100 --> 59:01.900\n kind of think like the more you use the product,\n\n59:01.900 --> 59:03.060\n the happier you are.\n\n59:03.060 --> 59:04.780\n That was always the argument at Facebook, by the way.\n\n59:04.780 --> 59:07.500\n It was like, well, people use it more,\n\n59:07.500 --> 59:09.300\n so they must be more happy.\n\n59:09.300 --> 59:11.140\n Turns out there are like a lot of things you use more\n\n59:11.140 --> 59:12.900\n that make you less happy in the world.\n\n59:12.900 --> 59:14.100\n Not talking about Facebook,\n\n59:14.100 --> 59:17.660\n just let's think about whether it's gambling or whatever,\n\n59:17.660 --> 59:19.060\n like that you can do more of,\n\n59:19.060 --> 59:20.740\n but doesn't necessarily make you happier.\n\n59:20.740 --> 59:22.780\n So the idea that time equals happiness,\n\n59:22.780 --> 59:27.060\n obviously you can't map utility and time together easily.\n\n59:27.060 --> 59:28.820\n There are a lot of edge cases.\n\n59:28.820 --> 59:30.460\n So when you look around the world and you say,\n\n59:30.460 --> 59:32.700\n well, what are all the ways we can model utility?\n\n59:32.700 --> 59:34.380\n That is like one of the,\n\n59:34.380 --> 59:36.260\n please, if you know someone smart doing this,\n\n59:36.260 --> 59:38.500\n introduce me because I'm fascinated by it.\n\n59:38.500 --> 59:40.580\n And it seems really tough.\n\n59:40.580 --> 59:42.740\n But the idea that reinforcement learning,\n\n59:42.740 --> 59:46.460\n like everyone interesting I know in machine learning,\n\n59:46.460 --> 59:48.820\n like I was really interested in recommender systems\n\n59:48.820 --> 59:49.820\n and supervised learning.\n\n59:49.820 --> 59:52.700\n And the more I dug into it, I was like,\n\n59:52.700 --> 59:54.460\n oh, literally everyone smart\n\n59:54.460 --> 59:56.460\n is working on reinforcement learning.\n\n59:56.460 --> 59:57.700\n Like literally everyone.\n\n59:57.700 --> 1:00:00.820\n You just made people at OpenAI and DeepMind very happy, yes.\n\n1:00:00.820 --> 1:00:02.660\n But I mean, but what's interesting is like,\n\n1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:06.660\n it's one thing to train a game and like,\n\n1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:09.220\n I mean that paper where they just took Atari\n\n1:00:09.220 --> 1:00:12.020\n and they used a ConvNet to basically just like\n\n1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:15.100\n train simple actions, mind blowing, right?\n\n1:00:15.100 --> 1:00:17.780\n Absolutely mind blowing, but it's a game, great.\n\n1:00:18.780 --> 1:00:23.620\n So now what if you're constructing a feed for a person,\n\n1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:24.460\n right?\n\n1:00:24.460 --> 1:00:29.460\n Like how can you construct that feed in such a way\n\n1:00:29.580 --> 1:00:32.380\n that optimizes for a diversity of experience,\n\n1:00:32.380 --> 1:00:35.860\n a longterm happiness, right?\n\n1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:38.420\n But that reward function,\n\n1:00:38.420 --> 1:00:41.180\n it turns out in reinforcement learning again,\n\n1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:45.220\n as I've learned, like reward design is really hard.\n\n1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:49.740\n And I don't know, like how do you design a scalar reward\n\n1:00:49.740 --> 1:00:51.340\n for someone's happiness over time?\n\n1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:53.300\n I mean, do you have to measure dopamine levels?\n\n1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:54.140\n Like, do you have to?\n\n1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:58.020\n Well, you have to have a lot more signals\n\n1:00:58.020 --> 1:00:59.500\n from the human being.\n\n1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:01.700\n Currently it feels like there's not enough signals\n\n1:01:01.700 --> 1:01:06.140\n coming from the human being users of this algorithm.\n\n1:01:06.140 --> 1:01:08.780\n So for reinforcement learning to work well,\n\n1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:10.860\n you need to have a lot more data.\n\n1:01:10.860 --> 1:01:11.980\n Needs to have a lot of data.\n\n1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:13.420\n And that actually is a challenge for anyone\n\n1:01:13.420 --> 1:01:14.500\n who wants to start something,\n\n1:01:14.500 --> 1:01:16.460\n which is you don't have a lot of data.\n\n1:01:16.460 --> 1:01:17.500\n So how do you compete?\n\n1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:20.020\n But I do think back to your original point,\n\n1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:23.420\n rethinking the algorithm, rethinking reward functions,\n\n1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:28.060\n rethinking utility, that's fascinating.\n\n1:01:28.060 --> 1:01:28.900\n That's cool.\n\n1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:31.060\n And I think that's an open opportunity\n\n1:01:31.060 --> 1:01:33.580\n for a company that figures it out.\n\n1:01:34.540 --> 1:01:37.420\n I have to ask about April, 2012,\n\n1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:42.420\n when Instagram, along with its massive employee base\n\n1:01:43.220 --> 1:01:46.820\n of 13 people was sold to Facebook for $1 billion.\n\n1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:50.220\n What was the process like on a business level,\n\n1:01:50.220 --> 1:01:52.140\n engineering level, human level?\n\n1:01:52.140 --> 1:01:54.940\n What was that process of selling to Facebook like?\n\n1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:56.460\n What did it feel like?\n\n1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:58.100\n So I want to provide some context,\n\n1:01:58.100 --> 1:02:00.900\n which is I worked in corporate development at Google,\n\n1:02:00.900 --> 1:02:02.660\n which not a lot of people know,\n\n1:02:02.660 --> 1:02:04.500\n but corporate development is effectively the group\n\n1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:06.220\n that buys companies, right?\n\n1:02:06.220 --> 1:02:08.140\n You sit there and you acquire companies.\n\n1:02:08.140 --> 1:02:10.940\n And I had sat through so many of these meetings\n\n1:02:10.940 --> 1:02:12.100\n with entrepreneurs.\n\n1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:14.540\n We actually, fun fact, we never acquired a single company\n\n1:02:14.540 --> 1:02:15.740\n when I worked in corporate development.\n\n1:02:15.740 --> 1:02:19.580\n So I can't claim that I had like a lot of experience,\n\n1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:23.420\n but I had enough experience to understand,\n\n1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:25.580\n okay, like what prices are people getting\n\n1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:27.340\n and what's the process?\n\n1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:30.420\n And as we started to grow,\n\n1:02:32.260 --> 1:02:33.980\n we were trying to keep this thing running\n\n1:02:33.980 --> 1:02:36.220\n and we were exhausted and we were 13 people.\n\n1:02:36.220 --> 1:02:38.820\n And I mean, we were trying to think back,\n\n1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:42.420\n it was probably 27, 37 now,\n\n1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:48.380\n so young on a relative basis, right?\n\n1:02:48.380 --> 1:02:50.540\n And we're trying to keep the thing running.\n\n1:02:50.540 --> 1:02:53.020\n And then we go out to raise money\n\n1:02:53.020 --> 1:02:57.420\n and we're kind of like the hot startup at the time.\n\n1:02:57.420 --> 1:03:00.460\n And I remember going into a specific VC and saying,\n\n1:03:00.460 --> 1:03:02.340\n our terms we're looking for are,\n\n1:03:02.340 --> 1:03:04.580\n we're looking for a $500 million valuation.\n\n1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:10.260\n And I've never seen so many jaws drop all in unison, right?\n\n1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:12.340\n And I was like, thanked and walked out the door\n\n1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:14.300\n very kindly after.\n\n1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:16.660\n And then I got a call the next day\n\n1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:18.660\n from someone who was connected to them.\n\n1:03:18.660 --> 1:03:21.220\n And they said, we just wanna let you know\n\n1:03:21.220 --> 1:03:22.900\n that like it was pretty offensive\n\n1:03:22.900 --> 1:03:25.060\n that you asked for a $500 million valuation.\n\n1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:30.060\n And I can't tell if that was like just negotiating or what,\n\n1:03:30.060 --> 1:03:32.580\n but it's true, like no one offered us more, right?\n\n1:03:32.580 --> 1:03:33.420\n So we were...\n\n1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:35.740\n So can you clarify the number again?\n\n1:03:35.740 --> 1:03:37.100\n You said how many million?\n\n1:03:37.100 --> 1:03:37.940\n 500.\n\n1:03:37.940 --> 1:03:38.780\n 500 million.\n\n1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:40.540\n 500 million, yeah, half a billion.\n\n1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.140\n So in my mind, I'm anchored like, okay,\n\n1:03:44.140 --> 1:03:46.660\n well, literally no one's biting at 500 million.\n\n1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:50.100\n And eventually we would get Sequoia and Greylock\n\n1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:54.100\n and others together at 500 million, basically, post.\n\n1:03:54.100 --> 1:03:56.940\n It was 450 pre, I think we raised $50 million.\n\n1:03:56.940 --> 1:03:59.140\n But just like no one was used to seeing\n\n1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:01.620\n a $500 million companies then.\n\n1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.980\n Like, I don't know if it was because we were just coming\n\n1:04:03.980 --> 1:04:06.860\n out of the hangover of 2008\n\n1:04:06.860 --> 1:04:10.500\n and things were still on recovery mode.\n\n1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:13.300\n But then along comes Facebook.\n\n1:04:13.300 --> 1:04:18.300\n And after some negotiation, we've two X to the number\n\n1:04:18.300 --> 1:04:21.020\n from a half a billion to a billion.\n\n1:04:21.020 --> 1:04:22.860\n Yeah, it seems pretty good.\n\n1:04:22.860 --> 1:04:27.300\n And I think Mark and I really saw eye to eye\n\n1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:29.100\n that this thing could be big.\n\n1:04:29.100 --> 1:04:30.220\n We thought we could...\n\n1:04:30.220 --> 1:04:32.620\n Their resources would help us scale it.\n\n1:04:32.620 --> 1:04:34.900\n And in a lot of ways it de risks.\n\n1:04:34.900 --> 1:04:37.100\n I mean, it de risks a lot of the employees lives\n\n1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:38.420\n for the rest of their lives,\n\n1:04:38.420 --> 1:04:40.420\n including me, including Mike, right?\n\n1:04:41.620 --> 1:04:42.900\n I think I might've had like 10 grand\n\n1:04:42.900 --> 1:04:44.740\n in my bank account at the time, right?\n\n1:04:44.740 --> 1:04:48.380\n Like we're working hard, we had nothing.\n\n1:04:48.380 --> 1:04:51.340\n So on a relative basis, it seems very high.\n\n1:04:51.340 --> 1:04:53.940\n And then I think the last company to exit\n\n1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:55.900\n for anywhere close to a billion was YouTube\n\n1:04:55.900 --> 1:04:56.980\n that I could think of.\n\n1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:02.420\n And thus began the giant long bull run of 2012\n\n1:05:02.420 --> 1:05:04.540\n to all the way to where we are now,\n\n1:05:04.540 --> 1:05:06.940\n where I saw some stat yesterday\n\n1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:11.060\n about like how many unicorns exist and it's absurd.\n\n1:05:11.060 --> 1:05:13.500\n But then again, never underestimate technology\n\n1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:15.740\n and like the value it can provide.\n\n1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:19.060\n And man, costs have dropped and man scale has increased.\n\n1:05:19.060 --> 1:05:23.180\n And you can make businesses make a lot of money now.\n\n1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:26.300\n But on a fundamental level, I don't know,\n\n1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:29.100\n like how do you describe the decision\n\n1:05:29.100 --> 1:05:32.460\n to sell a company with 13 people for a billion dollars?\n\n1:05:32.460 --> 1:05:36.420\n So first of all, like how did it take a lot of guts\n\n1:05:36.420 --> 1:05:38.860\n to sit at a table and say 500 million\n\n1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:41.660\n or 1 billion with Mark Zuckerberg?\n\n1:05:41.660 --> 1:05:44.220\n It seems like a very large number with 13.\n\n1:05:44.220 --> 1:05:45.580\n Like, especially...\n\n1:05:45.580 --> 1:05:47.180\n It doesn't seem, it is.\n\n1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:48.020\n It is.\n\n1:05:48.020 --> 1:05:49.140\n They're all large numbers.\n\n1:05:49.140 --> 1:05:54.140\n Especially like you said before the unicorn parade.\n\n1:05:55.620 --> 1:05:56.860\n I like that, I'm gonna use that.\n\n1:05:56.860 --> 1:05:57.980\n The unicorn parade?\n\n1:05:57.980 --> 1:05:58.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:59.700 --> 1:06:01.660\n You were at the head of the unicorn parade.\n\n1:06:01.660 --> 1:06:04.900\n It's the, yeah, it's a massive unicorn parade.\n\n1:06:04.900 --> 1:06:09.900\n Okay, so no, I mean, we knew we were worth\n\n1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:12.340\n quote unquote a lot, but we didn't,\n\n1:06:12.340 --> 1:06:14.580\n I mean, there was no market for Instagram.\n\n1:06:14.580 --> 1:06:17.140\n I mean, it's not, you couldn't mark to market this thing\n\n1:06:17.140 --> 1:06:18.060\n in the public markets.\n\n1:06:18.060 --> 1:06:20.940\n You didn't quite understand what it would be worth\n\n1:06:20.940 --> 1:06:23.020\n or was worth at the time.\n\n1:06:23.020 --> 1:06:24.700\n So in a market, an illiquid market\n\n1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:26.340\n where you have one buyer and one seller\n\n1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:27.620\n and you're going back and forth,\n\n1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:31.340\n and well, I guess there were like VC firms\n\n1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:34.860\n who were willing to invest at a certain valuation.\n\n1:06:34.860 --> 1:06:38.460\n So I don't know, you just go with your gut.\n\n1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:41.540\n And at the end of the day, I would say\n\n1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:46.540\n the hardest part of it was not realizing,\n\n1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:52.140\n like when we sold, it was tough\n\n1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:54.900\n because like literally everywhere I go,\n\n1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:59.220\n restaurants, whatever, like for a good six months after,\n\n1:06:59.220 --> 1:07:01.060\n there was a lot of attention on the deal,\n\n1:07:01.060 --> 1:07:03.100\n a lot of attention on the product,\n\n1:07:03.100 --> 1:07:06.380\n a lot of attention, it was kind of miserable, right?\n\n1:07:06.380 --> 1:07:08.140\n And you're like, wait, like I made a lot of money,\n\n1:07:08.140 --> 1:07:10.220\n but like, why is this not great?\n\n1:07:10.220 --> 1:07:11.940\n And it's because it turns out,\n\n1:07:14.060 --> 1:07:16.260\n I don't know, like I don't really keep in touch with Mark,\n\n1:07:16.260 --> 1:07:17.940\n but I've got to assume his job right now\n\n1:07:17.940 --> 1:07:19.980\n is not exactly the most happy job in the world.\n\n1:07:19.980 --> 1:07:21.740\n It's really tough when you're on top\n\n1:07:21.740 --> 1:07:24.420\n and it's really tough when you're in the limelight.\n\n1:07:24.420 --> 1:07:27.500\n So the decision itself was like, oh, cool, this is great.\n\n1:07:27.500 --> 1:07:29.260\n How lucky are we, right?\n\n1:07:29.260 --> 1:07:30.620\n So, okay, there's a million question I want to ask.\n\n1:07:30.620 --> 1:07:32.020\n Yeah, go, go, go.\n\n1:07:32.020 --> 1:07:37.020\n First of all, why is it hard to be on top?\n\n1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:39.340\n Why did you not feel good?\n\n1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:40.700\n Like, can you dig into that?\n\n1:07:40.700 --> 1:07:45.020\n It always, I've heard like Olympic athletes say\n\n1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:48.220\n after they win gold, they get depressed.\n\n1:07:49.340 --> 1:07:52.860\n Is it something like that where it feels like\n\n1:07:53.860 --> 1:07:56.340\n it was kind of like a thing you were working towards?\n\n1:07:56.340 --> 1:07:57.180\n Yeah, sure.\n\n1:07:57.180 --> 1:07:58.860\n Some loose definition of success.\n\n1:07:58.860 --> 1:08:00.500\n And this sure as heck feels like\n\n1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:03.460\n at least according to other startups,\n\n1:08:03.460 --> 1:08:04.860\n this is what success looks like.\n\n1:08:04.860 --> 1:08:08.420\n And now why don't I feel any better?\n\n1:08:08.420 --> 1:08:10.540\n I'm still human, I still have all the same problems.\n\n1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:11.740\n Is that the nature?\n\n1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:14.380\n Or is it just like negative attention of some kind?\n\n1:08:14.380 --> 1:08:16.020\n I think it's all of the above.\n\n1:08:16.020 --> 1:08:18.540\n But to be clear, there was a lot of happiness\n\n1:08:18.540 --> 1:08:20.780\n in terms of like, oh my God, this is great.\n\n1:08:20.780 --> 1:08:25.660\n Like we won the Super Bowl of startups, right?\n\n1:08:25.660 --> 1:08:28.700\n Anyone who can get to a liquidity event\n\n1:08:28.700 --> 1:08:31.020\n of anything meaningful feels like,\n\n1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:32.860\n wow, this is what we started out to do.\n\n1:08:32.860 --> 1:08:35.100\n Of course we want to create great things that people love,\n\n1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:38.580\n but like we won in a big way.\n\n1:08:38.580 --> 1:08:39.980\n But yeah, there's this big like,\n\n1:08:39.980 --> 1:08:43.860\n oh, if we won, what's next?\n\n1:08:43.860 --> 1:08:46.900\n So they call it the we have arrived syndrome,\n\n1:08:49.180 --> 1:08:52.660\n which I need to go back and look where I can quote that from.\n\n1:08:52.660 --> 1:08:54.140\n But I remember reading about it at the time.\n\n1:08:54.140 --> 1:08:56.060\n I was like, oh yeah, that's that.\n\n1:08:56.060 --> 1:08:59.220\n And I remember we had a product manager leave very early on\n\n1:08:59.220 --> 1:09:00.340\n when we got to Facebook.\n\n1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:01.940\n And he said to me,\n\n1:09:01.940 --> 1:09:03.740\n I just don't believe I can learn anything\n\n1:09:03.740 --> 1:09:05.100\n at this company anymore.\n\n1:09:05.100 --> 1:09:08.180\n It's like, it's hit its apex.\n\n1:09:08.180 --> 1:09:09.900\n We sold it great.\n\n1:09:09.900 --> 1:09:12.380\n I just don't have anything else to learn.\n\n1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:15.940\n So from 2012 all the way to the day I left in 2018,\n\n1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:18.940\n like the amount I learned and the humility\n\n1:09:18.940 --> 1:09:22.420\n with which I realized, oh, we thought we won.\n\n1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:23.500\n Billion dollars is cool,\n\n1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:26.140\n but like there are a hundred billion dollar companies.\n\n1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:29.580\n And by the way, on top of that, we had no revenue.\n\n1:09:29.580 --> 1:09:31.260\n We had, I mean, we had a cool product,\n\n1:09:31.260 --> 1:09:32.660\n but we didn't scale it yet.\n\n1:09:32.660 --> 1:09:34.900\n And there's so much to learn.\n\n1:09:34.900 --> 1:09:38.340\n And then competitors and how fun was it to fight Snapchat?\n\n1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:39.180\n Oh my God.\n\n1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:42.020\n Like it was, it's like Yankees Red Sox.\n\n1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:42.900\n It's great.\n\n1:09:42.900 --> 1:09:44.600\n Like that's what you live for.\n\n1:09:46.060 --> 1:09:47.900\n You know, you win some, you lose some,\n\n1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:51.680\n but the amount you can learn through that process,\n\n1:09:52.700 --> 1:09:56.860\n what I've realized in life is that there is no,\n\n1:09:56.860 --> 1:09:58.620\n and there's always someone who has more,\n\n1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:02.260\n there's always more challenge, just at different scales.\n\n1:10:02.260 --> 1:10:04.940\n And it sounds like a little Buddhist,\n\n1:10:04.940 --> 1:10:09.680\n but everything is super challenging,\n\n1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:11.100\n whether you're like a small business\n\n1:10:11.100 --> 1:10:13.100\n or an enormous business.\n\n1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:17.100\n I say like choose the game you like to play, right?\n\n1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:18.060\n You've got to imagine that\n\n1:10:18.060 --> 1:10:19.660\n if you're an amazing basketball player,\n\n1:10:19.660 --> 1:10:22.900\n you enjoy to some extent practicing basketball.\n\n1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:24.020\n It's gotta be something you love.\n\n1:10:24.020 --> 1:10:24.860\n It's gonna suck.\n\n1:10:24.860 --> 1:10:26.300\n It's gonna be hard.\n\n1:10:26.300 --> 1:10:27.460\n You're gonna have injuries, right?\n\n1:10:27.460 --> 1:10:28.460\n But you gotta love it.\n\n1:10:28.460 --> 1:10:30.460\n And the same thing with Instagram,\n\n1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:35.020\n which is we might've sold, but it was like, great.\n\n1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:37.220\n There's one Super Bowl title.\n\n1:10:37.220 --> 1:10:38.660\n Can we win five?\n\n1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:40.180\n What else can we do?\n\n1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:43.500\n Now I imagine you didn't ask this, but okay, so I left.\n\n1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:46.920\n There's a little bit of like, what do you do next, right?\n\n1:10:46.920 --> 1:10:49.220\n Like, how do you top that thing?\n\n1:10:49.220 --> 1:10:50.660\n It's the wrong question.\n\n1:10:50.660 --> 1:10:53.080\n The question is like, when you wake up every day,\n\n1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:54.900\n what is the hardest, most interesting thing\n\n1:10:54.900 --> 1:10:56.500\n you can go work on?\n\n1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:58.180\n Because like at the end of the day,\n\n1:10:58.180 --> 1:11:00.780\n we all turn into dirt, it doesn't matter, right?\n\n1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:02.540\n But what does matter is like,\n\n1:11:02.540 --> 1:11:05.420\n can we really enjoy this life?\n\n1:11:05.420 --> 1:11:08.540\n Not in a hedonistic way, because that's those,\n\n1:11:08.540 --> 1:11:09.780\n it's like the reinforcement learning,\n\n1:11:09.780 --> 1:11:12.860\n learning like short term versus long term objectives.\n\n1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:17.500\n Can you wake up every day and truly enjoy what you're doing\n\n1:11:19.420 --> 1:11:21.220\n knowing that it's gonna be painful?\n\n1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:24.060\n Knowing that like, no matter what you choose,\n\n1:11:24.060 --> 1:11:25.500\n it's gonna be painful.\n\n1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:26.940\n Whether you sit on a beach\n\n1:11:26.940 --> 1:11:29.980\n or whether you manage a thousand people or 10,000,\n\n1:11:29.980 --> 1:11:31.300\n it's gonna be painful.\n\n1:11:31.300 --> 1:11:34.300\n So choose something that's fun to have pain.\n\n1:11:35.180 --> 1:11:38.540\n But yes, there was a lot of, we have arrived\n\n1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:43.540\n and it's a maturation process you just have to go through.\n\n1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:47.060\n So no matter how much success there is,\n\n1:11:47.060 --> 1:11:48.100\n how much money you make,\n\n1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:51.300\n you have to wake up the next day and choose the hard life,\n\n1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:53.780\n whatever that means next, that's fun.\n\n1:11:53.780 --> 1:11:56.680\n The fun slash hard life, hard life that's fun.\n\n1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:00.420\n I guess what I'm trying to say is slightly different,\n\n1:12:00.420 --> 1:12:02.980\n which is just that no one realizes\n\n1:12:02.980 --> 1:12:05.380\n everything's gonna be hard.\n\n1:12:05.380 --> 1:12:07.780\n Even chilling out is hard.\n\n1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:09.980\n And then you just start worrying about stupid stuff.\n\n1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:12.780\n Like, I don't know, like did so and so\n\n1:12:12.780 --> 1:12:14.420\n forget to paint the house today\n\n1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:16.260\n or like did the gardener come or whatever?\n\n1:12:16.260 --> 1:12:18.400\n Like, or, oh, I'm so angry\n\n1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:20.160\n and my shipment of wine didn't show up\n\n1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:22.180\n and I'm sitting here on the beach without my wine.\n\n1:12:22.180 --> 1:12:24.160\n I don't know, I'm making shit up now, but like.\n\n1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:27.060\n It turns out that even chilling, AKA meditation,\n\n1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:27.900\n is hard work.\n\n1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:31.020\n Yeah, and at least meditation is like productive chilling\n\n1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:32.600\n where you're like actually training yourself\n\n1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:36.280\n to calm down and be, but backing up for a moment,\n\n1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:37.340\n everything's hard.\n\n1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:41.100\n You might as well be like playing the game you love to play.\n\n1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:46.100\n I just like playing and winning and I'm on the,\n\n1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.780\n I'm still on the, I think the first half of life,\n\n1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:53.300\n knock on wood, and I've got a lot of years\n\n1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:54.740\n and what am I gonna do, sit around?\n\n1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:57.240\n And the other way of looking at this, by the way,\n\n1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:02.420\n imagine you made one movie and it was great.\n\n1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:05.140\n Would you just like stop making movies?\n\n1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:06.960\n No, generally you're like, wow,\n\n1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:09.380\n I really like making movies, let's make another one.\n\n1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:10.380\n A lot of times, by the way,\n\n1:13:10.380 --> 1:13:11.980\n the second one or the third one, not that great,\n\n1:13:11.980 --> 1:13:13.980\n but the fourth one, awesome.\n\n1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:15.180\n And no one forgets the second,\n\n1:13:15.180 --> 1:13:17.580\n or everyone forgets the second and the third one.\n\n1:13:17.580 --> 1:13:20.740\n So there's just this constant process of like,\n\n1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:23.740\n can I produce and is that fun?\n\n1:13:23.740 --> 1:13:24.580\n Is that exciting?\n\n1:13:24.580 --> 1:13:25.400\n What else can I learn?\n\n1:13:25.400 --> 1:13:26.860\n So this machine learning stuff for me\n\n1:13:26.860 --> 1:13:30.660\n has been this awesome new chapter of being like,\n\n1:13:31.740 --> 1:13:33.680\n man, that's something I didn't understand at all.\n\n1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:37.220\n And now I feel like I'm one 10th of the way there.\n\n1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:39.380\n And that feels like a big mountain to climb.\n\n1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:42.660\n So I distracted us from the original question.\n\n1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:44.580\n No, and we'll return to the machine learning\n\n1:13:44.580 --> 1:13:46.560\n cause I'd love to explore your interest there.\n\n1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:50.100\n But I mean, speaking of sort of challenges and hard things,\n\n1:13:50.100 --> 1:13:51.740\n is there a possible world\n\n1:13:52.740 --> 1:13:56.180\n where sitting in a room with Mark Zuckerberg\n\n1:13:56.180 --> 1:14:00.040\n with a $1 billion deal, you turn it down?\n\n1:14:00.040 --> 1:14:01.180\n Yeah, of course.\n\n1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:03.260\n What does that world look like?\n\n1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:04.660\n Why would you turn it down?\n\n1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:05.660\n Why did you take it?\n\n1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:08.500\n What was the calculation that you were making?\n\n1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:11.540\n Thus enters the world of counterfactuals\n\n1:14:11.540 --> 1:14:13.220\n and not really knowing.\n\n1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:15.020\n And if only we could run that experiment.\n\n1:14:15.020 --> 1:14:16.500\n Well, the universe exists,\n\n1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:18.700\n it's just running in parallel to our own.\n\n1:14:18.700 --> 1:14:21.060\n Yeah, it's so fascinating, right?\n\n1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:24.780\n I mean, we're talking a lot about money,\n\n1:14:24.780 --> 1:14:26.440\n but the real question was,\n\n1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:30.540\n I'm not sure you'll believe me when I say this,\n\n1:14:30.540 --> 1:14:33.700\n but could we strap our little company\n\n1:14:33.700 --> 1:14:36.140\n onto the side of a rocket ship\n\n1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:39.560\n and like get out to a lot of people really, really quickly\n\n1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:44.560\n with the support, with the talent of a place like Facebook?\n\n1:14:45.220 --> 1:14:48.220\n I mean, people often ask me what I would do differently\n\n1:14:48.220 --> 1:14:49.060\n at Instagram today.\n\n1:14:49.060 --> 1:14:51.220\n And I say, well, I'd probably hire more carefully\n\n1:14:51.220 --> 1:14:53.740\n because we showed up just like before I knew it,\n\n1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.380\n we had like a hundred people on the team\n\n1:14:56.380 --> 1:14:57.780\n and 200, then 300.\n\n1:14:57.780 --> 1:14:59.560\n I don't know where all these people were coming from.\n\n1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:00.780\n I never had to recruit them.\n\n1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:02.380\n I never had to screen them.\n\n1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:05.100\n They were just like internal transfers, right?\n\n1:15:05.100 --> 1:15:07.460\n So it's like relying on the Facebook hiring machine,\n\n1:15:07.460 --> 1:15:11.780\n which is quite sort of, I mean, it's an elaborate machine.\n\n1:15:11.780 --> 1:15:12.740\n It's great, by the way.\n\n1:15:12.740 --> 1:15:15.260\n They have really talented people there.\n\n1:15:15.260 --> 1:15:20.260\n But my point is the choice was like, take this thing,\n\n1:15:21.420 --> 1:15:22.900\n put it on the side of a rocket ship\n\n1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:24.940\n that you know is growing very quickly.\n\n1:15:25.820 --> 1:15:27.240\n Like I had seen what had happened\n\n1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:30.860\n when Ev sold Blogger to Google and then Google went public.\n\n1:15:30.860 --> 1:15:34.580\n Remember we sold before Facebook went public.\n\n1:15:34.580 --> 1:15:37.660\n There was a moment at which the stock price was $17,\n\n1:15:37.660 --> 1:15:40.180\n by the way, Facebook stock price was $17.\n\n1:15:40.180 --> 1:15:43.340\n I remember thinking, what the fuck did I just do, right?\n\n1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:48.220\n Now at 320 ish, I don't know where we are today.\n\n1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:52.940\n But like, okay, like the best thing by the way\n\n1:15:52.940 --> 1:15:56.780\n is like when the stock is down, everyone calls you a dope.\n\n1:15:56.780 --> 1:15:58.660\n And then when it's up, they also call you a dope,\n\n1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:01.480\n but just for a different reason, right?\n\n1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:02.540\n Like you can't win.\n\n1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:03.860\n Less than in there somewhere.\n\n1:16:03.860 --> 1:16:04.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:04.700 --> 1:16:06.700\n So, but you know, the choice is to strap yourself\n\n1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:08.660\n to a rocket ship or to build your own.\n\n1:16:08.660 --> 1:16:11.100\n You know, Mr. Elon built his own\n\n1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.700\n literally with a rocket ship.\n\n1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:18.380\n That's a difficult choice because there's a world.\n\n1:16:18.380 --> 1:16:19.820\n Actually, I would say something different,\n\n1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:23.260\n which is Elon and others decided to sell PayPal\n\n1:16:23.260 --> 1:16:25.140\n for not that much.\n\n1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:26.920\n I mean, how much was it about a billion dollars?\n\n1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:27.760\n I can't remember.\n\n1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:28.580\n Something like that, yeah.\n\n1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:30.260\n I mean, it was early and,\n\n1:16:30.260 --> 1:16:31.580\n but it's worth a lot more now.\n\n1:16:31.580 --> 1:16:33.160\n To then build a new rocket ship.\n\n1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:34.820\n So this is the cool part, right?\n\n1:16:34.820 --> 1:16:37.340\n If you are an entrepreneur\n\n1:16:37.340 --> 1:16:40.460\n and you own a controlling stake in the company,\n\n1:16:40.460 --> 1:16:42.740\n not only is it really hard to do something else\n\n1:16:42.740 --> 1:16:45.660\n with your life because all of the, you know,\n\n1:16:45.660 --> 1:16:48.520\n value is tied up in you as a personality\n\n1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:50.960\n attached to this company, right?\n\n1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:53.740\n But if you sell it and you're getting yourself enough capital\n\n1:16:53.740 --> 1:16:55.880\n and you like have enough energy,\n\n1:16:55.880 --> 1:16:58.020\n you can do another thing or 10 other things\n\n1:16:58.020 --> 1:17:00.020\n or in Elon's case, like a bunch of other things.\n\n1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:02.060\n I don't know, like I lost count at this point.\n\n1:17:03.380 --> 1:17:05.580\n And it might've seemed silly at the time.\n\n1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:07.300\n And sure, like if you look back,\n\n1:17:07.300 --> 1:17:10.500\n man, PayPal is worth a lot now, right?\n\n1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:11.340\n But I don't know.\n\n1:17:11.340 --> 1:17:13.940\n Like, do you think Elon like cares about like,\n\n1:17:13.940 --> 1:17:15.260\n are we gonna buy Pinterest or not?\n\n1:17:15.260 --> 1:17:17.540\n Like, I just, he is,\n\n1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:20.900\n he created a massive capital\n\n1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:23.300\n that allowed him to do what he wants to do.\n\n1:17:23.300 --> 1:17:24.120\n And that's awesome.\n\n1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:25.500\n That's more freeing than anything\n\n1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:28.380\n because when you are an entrepreneur attached to a company,\n\n1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:30.720\n you gotta stay at that company for a really long time.\n\n1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:32.900\n It's really hard to remove yourself.\n\n1:17:32.900 --> 1:17:34.500\n But I'm not sure how much he loved\n\n1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:37.460\n PayPal versus SpaceX and Tesla.\n\n1:17:37.460 --> 1:17:41.420\n I have a sense that you love Instagram.\n\n1:17:41.420 --> 1:17:43.620\n Yeah, I loved enough to like work\n\n1:17:43.620 --> 1:17:44.940\n for six years beyond the deal.\n\n1:17:44.940 --> 1:17:46.700\n Which is rare, which is very rare.\n\n1:17:46.700 --> 1:17:47.540\n You chose.\n\n1:17:47.540 --> 1:17:48.720\n But can I tell you why?\n\n1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:49.560\n Sure.\n\n1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:51.180\n It's, please.\n\n1:17:51.180 --> 1:17:55.100\n There are not a lot of companies that you can be part of\n\n1:17:55.100 --> 1:17:57.380\n where the Pope's like,\n\n1:17:57.380 --> 1:17:59.260\n I would like to sign up for your product.\n\n1:17:59.260 --> 1:18:01.540\n Like I'm not a religious person at all.\n\n1:18:01.540 --> 1:18:02.780\n I'm really not.\n\n1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:03.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:03.620 --> 1:18:05.380\n You go to the Vatican and you're like walking\n\n1:18:05.380 --> 1:18:07.940\n among giant columns and you're hearing the music\n\n1:18:07.940 --> 1:18:10.540\n and everything and like the Pope walks in\n\n1:18:10.540 --> 1:18:12.620\n and he wants to press the signup button on your product.\n\n1:18:12.620 --> 1:18:15.040\n Like it's a moment in life, okay?\n\n1:18:15.040 --> 1:18:17.440\n No matter what your persuasion, okay?\n\n1:18:19.380 --> 1:18:22.540\n The number of doors and experiences that that opened up\n\n1:18:22.540 --> 1:18:23.920\n was, it was incredible.\n\n1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:26.800\n I mean, the people I got to meet, the places I got to go,\n\n1:18:27.820 --> 1:18:30.140\n I assume maybe like a payments company\n\n1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:32.060\n is slightly different, right?\n\n1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:34.780\n But that's why, like it was so fun.\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:37.420\n And plus I truly believed we were building\n\n1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:40.860\n such a great product and I loved, loved the game.\n\n1:18:40.860 --> 1:18:41.980\n It wasn't about money.\n\n1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:43.560\n It was about the game.\n\n1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:46.840\n Do you think you had the guts to say no?\n\n1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:49.360\n Is that, so here's, I often think about this,\n\n1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:52.500\n like how hard is it for an entrepreneur to say no?\n\n1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:54.900\n Because the peer pressure.\n\n1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:57.900\n So every, like basically the sea of entrepreneurs\n\n1:18:57.900 --> 1:18:59.740\n in Silicon Valley are gonna tell you,\n\n1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:01.680\n I mean, this is their dream.\n\n1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:05.200\n The thing you were sitting before is a dream.\n\n1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:07.460\n To walk away from that is really,\n\n1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:09.480\n it seems like nearly impossible.\n\n1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:16.060\n Because Instagram could in 10 years be,\n\n1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:17.420\n you could talk about Google.\n\n1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:20.260\n You could be making self driving cars\n\n1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:21.920\n and building rockets that go to Mars\n\n1:19:21.920 --> 1:19:23.620\n and compete with SpaceX.\n\n1:19:23.620 --> 1:19:24.460\n Totally.\n\n1:19:24.460 --> 1:19:27.340\n And so that's an interesting decision to say,\n\n1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:31.460\n am I willing to risk it?\n\n1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:34.480\n And the reason I also say it's an interesting decision\n\n1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:37.760\n because it feels like per our previous discussion,\n\n1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:42.140\n if you're launching a social network company,\n\n1:19:42.140 --> 1:19:45.260\n there's going to be that meeting, whatever that number is.\n\n1:19:45.260 --> 1:19:48.100\n If you're successful, if you're on this rocket ship\n\n1:19:48.100 --> 1:19:50.740\n of success, there's going to be a meeting\n\n1:19:50.740 --> 1:19:53.740\n with one of the social media, social network companies\n\n1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:58.280\n that wanna buy you, whether it's Facebook or Twitter,\n\n1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.260\n but it could also very well be Google\n\n1:20:00.260 --> 1:20:04.540\n who seems to have like a graveyard\n\n1:20:04.540 --> 1:20:06.620\n of failed social networks.\n\n1:20:06.620 --> 1:20:08.940\n And it's, I mean, I don't know.\n\n1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:11.500\n I think about that, how difficult it is\n\n1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:13.700\n for an entrepreneur to make that decision.\n\n1:20:13.700 --> 1:20:15.920\n How many have successfully made that decision?\n\n1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:18.220\n I guess, this is a big question.\n\n1:20:18.220 --> 1:20:20.380\n It's sad to me, to be honest,\n\n1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:21.980\n that too many make that decision,\n\n1:20:21.980 --> 1:20:23.660\n perhaps for the wrong reason.\n\n1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:25.540\n Sorry, when you say make the decision,\n\n1:20:25.540 --> 1:20:26.700\n you mean to the affirmative.\n\n1:20:26.700 --> 1:20:27.620\n To the affirmative, yeah.\n\n1:20:27.620 --> 1:20:28.620\n Got it, yeah.\n\n1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:31.420\n There are also companies that don't sell, right?\n\n1:20:31.420 --> 1:20:34.860\n And take the PATH and say, we're gonna be independent.\n\n1:20:34.860 --> 1:20:37.340\n And then you've never heard of them again.\n\n1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:40.380\n Like I remember PATH, right?\n\n1:20:40.380 --> 1:20:42.320\n Was one of our competitors early on.\n\n1:20:43.340 --> 1:20:45.820\n There was a big moment when they had,\n\n1:20:45.820 --> 1:20:46.860\n I can't remember what it was,\n\n1:20:46.860 --> 1:20:50.780\n like $110 million offer from Google or something.\n\n1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:52.700\n It might've been larger, I don't know.\n\n1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:56.580\n And I remember there was like this big TechCrunch article\n\n1:20:56.580 --> 1:20:59.700\n that was like, they turned it down after talking deeply\n\n1:20:59.700 --> 1:21:01.800\n about their values and everything.\n\n1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:05.760\n And I don't know the inner workings of Foursquare,\n\n1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:09.240\n but I'm certain there were many conversations over time\n\n1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:11.780\n where there were companies that wanted Foursquare as well.\n\n1:21:11.780 --> 1:21:15.940\n Recently, I mean, what other companies?\n\n1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:16.980\n There's Clubhouse, right?\n\n1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:17.820\n Like, I don't know.\n\n1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.580\n Maybe people were really interested in them too.\n\n1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:25.580\n Like there are plenty of moments where people say no\n\n1:21:25.580 --> 1:21:28.500\n and we just forget that those things happen.\n\n1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:33.060\n We only focus on the ones where like they said yes\n\n1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:36.300\n and like, wow, like what if they had stayed independent?\n\n1:21:36.300 --> 1:21:37.140\n So I don't know.\n\n1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:39.740\n I used to think a lot about this and now I just don't\n\n1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:41.220\n because I'm like, whatever.\n\n1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:44.820\n Things have gone pretty well.\n\n1:21:44.820 --> 1:21:45.980\n I'm ready for the next game.\n\n1:21:45.980 --> 1:21:50.780\n I mean, think about an athlete where, I don't know,\n\n1:21:50.780 --> 1:21:53.700\n maybe they do something wrong in the World Series\n\n1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:54.540\n or whatever.\n\n1:21:54.540 --> 1:21:57.580\n If you let it haunt you for the rest of your career,\n\n1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:00.380\n like why not just be like, I don't know, it was a game.\n\n1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:02.940\n Next game, next shot, right?\n\n1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:05.100\n And if you just move to that world,\n\n1:22:05.100 --> 1:22:07.460\n like at least I have a next shot, right?\n\n1:22:07.460 --> 1:22:10.740\n No, that's beautiful, but I mean, just insights\n\n1:22:10.740 --> 1:22:12.540\n and it's funny you brought up Clubhouse.\n\n1:22:12.540 --> 1:22:14.220\n It is very true.\n\n1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:19.220\n It seems like Clubhouse is on the downward path\n\n1:22:19.500 --> 1:22:23.300\n and it's very possible to see a billion plus dollar deal\n\n1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:27.220\n at some stage, maybe like a year ago or half a year ago\n\n1:22:27.220 --> 1:22:28.580\n from Facebook, from Google.\n\n1:22:28.580 --> 1:22:30.780\n I think Facebook was flirting with that idea too.\n\n1:22:30.780 --> 1:22:34.780\n And I think a lot of companies probably were.\n\n1:22:34.780 --> 1:22:37.140\n I wish it was more public.\n\n1:22:37.140 --> 1:22:37.980\n You know what?\n\n1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:41.260\n There's not like a bad public story\n\n1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:43.940\n about them making the decision to walk away.\n\n1:22:43.940 --> 1:22:45.020\n We just don't hear about it.\n\n1:22:45.020 --> 1:22:47.540\n And then we get to see the results of that success\n\n1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:49.300\n or the failure, more often failure.\n\n1:22:49.300 --> 1:22:52.420\n So a couple of things, one is,\n\n1:22:52.420 --> 1:22:54.900\n I would not assume Clubhouse is down for the count at all.\n\n1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:56.580\n They're young, they have plenty of money,\n\n1:22:56.580 --> 1:22:58.580\n they're run by really smart people.\n\n1:22:59.620 --> 1:23:02.420\n I'd give them like a very fighting chance to figure it out.\n\n1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:04.180\n There are a lot of times when people call Twitter\n\n1:23:04.180 --> 1:23:05.860\n down for the count and they figure it out\n\n1:23:05.860 --> 1:23:08.340\n and they seem to be doing well, right?\n\n1:23:08.340 --> 1:23:09.780\n So just backing up like,\n\n1:23:09.780 --> 1:23:11.820\n and not knowing anything about their internals,\n\n1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:15.580\n like there's a strong chance they will figure it out\n\n1:23:15.580 --> 1:23:16.780\n and that people are just down\n\n1:23:16.780 --> 1:23:18.500\n because they like being down about companies.\n\n1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.060\n They like assuming that they're gonna fail.\n\n1:23:20.060 --> 1:23:21.220\n So who knows, right?\n\n1:23:21.220 --> 1:23:22.580\n But let's take the ones in the past\n\n1:23:22.580 --> 1:23:24.740\n where like we know how it played out.\n\n1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:25.940\n There are plenty of examples\n\n1:23:25.940 --> 1:23:28.140\n where people have turned down big offers\n\n1:23:28.140 --> 1:23:30.940\n and then you've just never heard from them again,\n\n1:23:30.940 --> 1:23:32.420\n but we never focus on the companies\n\n1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:34.660\n because you just forget that those were big.\n\n1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:36.220\n But inside your psyche,\n\n1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:42.220\n I think it's easy for someone with enough money\n\n1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:45.060\n to say money doesn't matter, which I think is like,\n\n1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:45.900\n it's bullshit.\n\n1:23:45.900 --> 1:23:50.220\n Of course, money matters to people, but at the moment,\n\n1:23:50.220 --> 1:23:53.100\n you just can't even grasp like the number of zeros\n\n1:23:53.100 --> 1:23:53.940\n that you're talking about.\n\n1:23:53.940 --> 1:23:56.660\n It just doesn't make sense, right?\n\n1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:58.580\n So to think rationally in that moment\n\n1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:01.380\n is not something many people are equipped to do,\n\n1:24:01.380 --> 1:24:03.020\n especially not people\n\n1:24:03.020 --> 1:24:05.300\n where I think we had founded the company a year earlier,\n\n1:24:05.300 --> 1:24:07.540\n maybe two years earlier, like a year and a half,\n\n1:24:07.540 --> 1:24:11.940\n we were 13 people, but I will say,\n\n1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:14.460\n I still don't know if it was the right decision\n\n1:24:14.460 --> 1:24:16.020\n because I don't have that counterfactual.\n\n1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:17.620\n I don't know that other world.\n\n1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.260\n I'm just thankful that by and large,\n\n1:24:21.260 --> 1:24:23.780\n most people love Instagram, still do.\n\n1:24:23.780 --> 1:24:25.540\n By and large, people are very happy\n\n1:24:25.540 --> 1:24:28.220\n with like the time we had there\n\n1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:29.700\n and I'm proud of what we built.\n\n1:24:29.700 --> 1:24:31.660\n So like, I'm cool.\n\n1:24:31.660 --> 1:24:35.620\n Like now it's next shot, right?\n\n1:24:35.620 --> 1:24:40.380\n Well, if we could just linger on this Yankees versus Red Sox,\n\n1:24:40.380 --> 1:24:42.460\n the fun of it, the competition over,\n\n1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:45.380\n I would say over the space of features.\n\n1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:49.220\n So there are a bunch of features,\n\n1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:54.220\n like there's photos, there's one minute videos on Instagram,\n\n1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:58.860\n there's IGTV, there's stories, there's reels, there's live.\n\n1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:01.940\n So that sounds like it's like a long list\n\n1:25:01.940 --> 1:25:04.340\n of too much stuff, but it's not\n\n1:25:04.340 --> 1:25:07.540\n because it feels like they're close together,\n\n1:25:07.540 --> 1:25:09.620\n but they're somehow, like what we're saying,\n\n1:25:09.620 --> 1:25:10.780\n fundamentally distinct,\n\n1:25:10.780 --> 1:25:13.340\n like each of the things I mentioned.\n\n1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:15.940\n Maybe can you describe the philosophies,\n\n1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:17.860\n the design philosophies behind some of these,\n\n1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:19.580\n how you were thinking about it\n\n1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:24.580\n during the historic war between Snapchat and Instagram\n\n1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:25.820\n or just in general,\n\n1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:30.100\n like this space of features that was discovered.\n\n1:25:30.100 --> 1:25:34.340\n There's this great book by Clay Christensen\n\n1:25:34.340 --> 1:25:36.260\n called, Competing Against Luck.\n\n1:25:36.260 --> 1:25:39.260\n It's like a terrible title,\n\n1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:43.460\n but within it, there's effectively an expression\n\n1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.740\n of this thing called jobs to be done theory.\n\n1:25:46.580 --> 1:25:48.980\n And it's unclear if like he came up with it\n\n1:25:48.980 --> 1:25:50.020\n or some of his colleagues,\n\n1:25:50.020 --> 1:25:52.060\n but there are a bunch of places you can find\n\n1:25:52.060 --> 1:25:53.300\n with people claiming to have come up\n\n1:25:53.300 --> 1:25:55.140\n with this jobs to be done theory.\n\n1:25:55.140 --> 1:25:59.140\n But the idea is if you like zoom out\n\n1:25:59.140 --> 1:26:00.380\n and you look at your product,\n\n1:26:00.380 --> 1:26:04.940\n you ask yourself, why are people hiring your product?\n\n1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:07.020\n Like imagine every product in your life\n\n1:26:07.020 --> 1:26:10.140\n is effectively an employee, you know,\n\n1:26:10.140 --> 1:26:11.700\n you're CEO of your life\n\n1:26:11.700 --> 1:26:13.860\n and you hire products to be employees effectively.\n\n1:26:13.860 --> 1:26:15.660\n They all have roles and jobs, right?\n\n1:26:16.660 --> 1:26:18.380\n Why are you hiring a product?\n\n1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:19.540\n Why do you want that product\n\n1:26:19.540 --> 1:26:21.020\n to perform something in your life?\n\n1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:22.660\n And like, what are the hidden reasons\n\n1:26:22.660 --> 1:26:25.580\n why you're in love with this product?\n\n1:26:26.740 --> 1:26:28.780\n Instagram was about sharing your life\n\n1:26:28.780 --> 1:26:31.620\n with others visually, period, right?\n\n1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:34.340\n Why? Because you feel connected with them.\n\n1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:35.620\n You get to show off.\n\n1:26:35.620 --> 1:26:38.900\n You get to feel good and cared about, right?\n\n1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:43.900\n With likes and it turns out that that will,\n\n1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:46.500\n I think forever define Instagram\n\n1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:49.740\n and any product that serves that job\n\n1:26:49.740 --> 1:26:52.420\n is going to do very well, okay?\n\n1:26:52.420 --> 1:26:55.180\n Stories let's take as an example\n\n1:26:55.180 --> 1:26:58.060\n is very much serving that job.\n\n1:26:58.060 --> 1:27:00.940\n In fact, it serves it better than the original product\n\n1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:04.300\n because when you're large and have an enormous audience,\n\n1:27:04.300 --> 1:27:08.020\n you're worried about people seeing your stuff\n\n1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:09.500\n or you're worried about being permanent\n\n1:27:09.500 --> 1:27:11.540\n so that a college admissions person\n\n1:27:11.540 --> 1:27:13.460\n is going to see your photo of you doing something.\n\n1:27:13.460 --> 1:27:16.620\n And so it turns out that that is a more efficient way\n\n1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:19.780\n of performing that job than the original product was.\n\n1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:22.620\n The original product still has its value,\n\n1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:24.660\n but at scale, these two things together\n\n1:27:24.660 --> 1:27:26.380\n work really, really well.\n\n1:27:26.380 --> 1:27:29.780\n Now, I will claim that other parts of the product\n\n1:27:29.780 --> 1:27:32.740\n over time didn't perform that job as well.\n\n1:27:32.740 --> 1:27:35.580\n I think IGTV probably didn't, right?\n\n1:27:35.580 --> 1:27:38.260\n Shopping is like completely unrelated\n\n1:27:38.260 --> 1:27:40.740\n to what I just described, but it might work.\n\n1:27:40.740 --> 1:27:41.820\n I don't know, right?\n\n1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:46.740\n Products I think, products that succeed\n\n1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:49.500\n are products that all share this parent node\n\n1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:52.060\n of like this job to be done that is in common.\n\n1:27:52.060 --> 1:27:55.380\n And then they're just like different ways of doing it, right?\n\n1:27:55.380 --> 1:27:57.620\n Apple, I think does a great job with this, right?\n\n1:27:57.620 --> 1:27:59.660\n It's like managing your digital life\n\n1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:01.900\n and all the products just work together.\n\n1:28:01.900 --> 1:28:06.140\n They sync, they're like, it's beautiful, right?\n\n1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:10.420\n Even if they require like silly specific cords to work,\n\n1:28:10.420 --> 1:28:12.900\n but they're all part of a system.\n\n1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:14.220\n It's when you leave that system\n\n1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:15.580\n and you start doing something weird\n\n1:28:15.580 --> 1:28:17.780\n that people start scratching their head\n\n1:28:17.780 --> 1:28:19.260\n and I think you are less successful.\n\n1:28:19.260 --> 1:28:20.460\n So I think one of the challenges\n\n1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:22.460\n Facebook has had throughout its life\n\n1:28:22.460 --> 1:28:24.580\n is that it has never fully, I think,\n\n1:28:24.580 --> 1:28:28.100\n appreciated the job to be done of the main product.\n\n1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:29.220\n And what it's done is said,\n\n1:28:29.220 --> 1:28:31.420\n ooh, there's a shiny object over there.\n\n1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:32.780\n That startup's getting some traction.\n\n1:28:32.780 --> 1:28:34.460\n Let's go copy that thing.\n\n1:28:34.460 --> 1:28:36.900\n And then they're confused why it doesn't work.\n\n1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:37.940\n Like why doesn't it work?\n\n1:28:37.940 --> 1:28:40.100\n It's because the people who show up for this\n\n1:28:40.100 --> 1:28:42.620\n don't want that, it's different.\n\n1:28:42.620 --> 1:28:44.300\n What's the purpose of Facebook?\n\n1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:47.500\n So I remember I was a very early Facebook user.\n\n1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:50.700\n The reason I was personally excited about Facebook\n\n1:28:50.700 --> 1:28:55.580\n is because you can, first of all, use your real name.\n\n1:28:55.580 --> 1:28:58.060\n Like I can exist in this world.\n\n1:28:58.060 --> 1:29:00.820\n It can be like formally exist.\n\n1:29:00.820 --> 1:29:04.780\n I like anonymity for certain things, Reddit and so on,\n\n1:29:04.780 --> 1:29:09.260\n but I want it to also exist not anonymously\n\n1:29:09.260 --> 1:29:12.260\n so that I can connect with other friends of mine\n\n1:29:12.260 --> 1:29:16.020\n nonanonymously and there's a reliable way to know\n\n1:29:16.020 --> 1:29:19.940\n that I'm real and they're real and that we're connecting.\n\n1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:24.780\n And it's kind of like, I liked it for the reasons\n\n1:29:24.780 --> 1:29:27.100\n that people like LinkedIn, I guess.\n\n1:29:27.100 --> 1:29:30.900\n But like without the form, like not everybody is dressed up\n\n1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.580\n and being super polite, like more like with friends.\n\n1:29:34.580 --> 1:29:37.540\n But then it became something much bigger than that,\n\n1:29:37.540 --> 1:29:39.300\n I suppose, there's a feed.\n\n1:29:39.300 --> 1:29:44.300\n It became this, I mean, it became a place\n\n1:29:44.380 --> 1:29:49.380\n to discover content, to share content\n\n1:29:49.940 --> 1:29:53.740\n that's not just about connecting directly with friends.\n\n1:29:53.740 --> 1:29:54.740\n I mean, it became something else.\n\n1:29:54.740 --> 1:29:56.540\n I don't even know what it is really.\n\n1:29:56.540 --> 1:29:58.820\n So you said Instagram is a place\n\n1:29:58.820 --> 1:30:02.100\n where you visually share your life.\n\n1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:03.620\n What is Facebook?\n\n1:30:03.620 --> 1:30:06.140\n Well, let's go back to the founding of Facebook\n\n1:30:06.140 --> 1:30:09.660\n and why it worked really well initially at Harvard\n\n1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:12.020\n and then Dartmouth and Stanford and I can't remember,\n\n1:30:12.020 --> 1:30:14.620\n probably MIT, there were like a handful of schools\n\n1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:16.060\n in that first tranche, right?\n\n1:30:17.940 --> 1:30:19.820\n It worked because there are communities\n\n1:30:19.820 --> 1:30:23.300\n that exist in the world that want to transact.\n\n1:30:23.300 --> 1:30:25.340\n And when I say transact, I don't mean commercially,\n\n1:30:25.340 --> 1:30:28.380\n I just mean they want to share, they want to coordinate,\n\n1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:32.020\n they want to communicate, they want a space for themselves.\n\n1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:36.340\n And Facebook at its best, I think is that.\n\n1:30:36.340 --> 1:30:39.180\n And if actually you look at the most popular products\n\n1:30:39.180 --> 1:30:42.060\n that Facebook has built over time,\n\n1:30:42.060 --> 1:30:45.260\n if you look at things like groups, marketplace,\n\n1:30:45.260 --> 1:30:47.500\n groups is enormous.\n\n1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:50.340\n And groups is effectively like everyone can found\n\n1:30:50.340 --> 1:30:53.460\n their own little Stanford or Dartmouth or MIT, right?\n\n1:30:53.460 --> 1:30:57.060\n And find each other and share and communicate\n\n1:30:57.060 --> 1:31:00.340\n about something that matters deeply to them.\n\n1:31:00.340 --> 1:31:03.860\n That is the core of what Facebook was built around.\n\n1:31:03.860 --> 1:31:08.860\n And I think today is where it stands most strongly.\n\n1:31:09.060 --> 1:31:09.900\n Yeah, it's brilliant.\n\n1:31:09.900 --> 1:31:13.620\n The groups, I wish groups were done better.\n\n1:31:13.620 --> 1:31:16.060\n It feels like it's not a first class citizen.\n\n1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:19.780\n I know I may be saying something without much knowledge,\n\n1:31:19.780 --> 1:31:24.020\n but it feels like it's kind of bolted on\n\n1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:26.140\n while being used a lot.\n\n1:31:26.140 --> 1:31:28.940\n It feels like there needs to be a little bit more structure\n\n1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:32.820\n in terms of discovery, in terms of like.\n\n1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:33.780\n I mean, look at Reddit.\n\n1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:36.540\n Like Reddit is basically groups of public and open\n\n1:31:36.540 --> 1:31:38.620\n and a little bit crazy, right?\n\n1:31:38.620 --> 1:31:39.460\n In a good way.\n\n1:31:40.740 --> 1:31:42.420\n But there's clear product market fit\n\n1:31:42.420 --> 1:31:44.860\n for that specific use case.\n\n1:31:44.860 --> 1:31:47.060\n And it doesn't have to be a college, it can be anything.\n\n1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.460\n It can be a small group, a big group,\n\n1:31:48.460 --> 1:31:50.180\n it can be group messaging.\n\n1:31:50.180 --> 1:31:53.220\n Facebook shines, I think, when it leans into that.\n\n1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:56.620\n I think when there are other companies\n\n1:31:56.620 --> 1:32:00.380\n that just seem exciting and now all of a sudden\n\n1:32:00.380 --> 1:32:02.380\n the product shifts in some fundamental way\n\n1:32:02.380 --> 1:32:05.820\n to go try to compete with that other thing,\n\n1:32:05.820 --> 1:32:08.260\n that's when I think consumers get confused.\n\n1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:10.660\n Even if you can be successful,\n\n1:32:10.660 --> 1:32:13.020\n like even if you can compete with that other company,\n\n1:32:13.020 --> 1:32:16.220\n even if you can figure out how to bolt it on,\n\n1:32:16.220 --> 1:32:17.980\n eventually you come back and you look at the app\n\n1:32:17.980 --> 1:32:20.620\n and you're like, I just don't know why I opened this app.\n\n1:32:20.620 --> 1:32:23.180\n Like why, like too many things going on.\n\n1:32:23.180 --> 1:32:24.580\n And that was always a worry.\n\n1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:26.220\n I mean, you listed all the things at Instagram\n\n1:32:26.220 --> 1:32:27.580\n and it almost gave me a heart attack,\n\n1:32:27.580 --> 1:32:30.460\n like way too many things.\n\n1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:31.900\n But I don't know, entrepreneurs get bored.\n\n1:32:31.900 --> 1:32:32.900\n They want to add things.\n\n1:32:32.900 --> 1:32:34.100\n They want to like, right?\n\n1:32:35.980 --> 1:32:37.300\n I don't have a good answer for it,\n\n1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:41.500\n except for that I think being true to your original use case\n\n1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:43.060\n and not even original use case,\n\n1:32:43.060 --> 1:32:46.260\n but sorry, actually not use case, original job.\n\n1:32:46.260 --> 1:32:49.340\n There are many use cases under that job.\n\n1:32:49.340 --> 1:32:52.220\n Being true to that and like being really good at it\n\n1:32:52.220 --> 1:32:56.100\n over time and morphing as needs change,\n\n1:32:57.180 --> 1:32:59.540\n I think that's how to make a company last forever.\n\n1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:03.860\n And I mean, honestly, like my main thesis\n\n1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:07.540\n about why Facebook is in the position it is today\n\n1:33:07.540 --> 1:33:12.540\n is if they have had a series of product launches\n\n1:33:12.540 --> 1:33:16.340\n that delighted people over time,\n\n1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:17.980\n I think they'd be in a totally different world.\n\n1:33:17.980 --> 1:33:20.420\n So just like imagine for a moment,\n\n1:33:20.420 --> 1:33:21.780\n and by the way, Apple's entering this,\n\n1:33:21.780 --> 1:33:23.860\n but like Apple for so long,\n\n1:33:23.860 --> 1:33:25.300\n just like product after product,\n\n1:33:25.300 --> 1:33:26.620\n you couldn't wait for it.\n\n1:33:26.620 --> 1:33:27.900\n You stood in line for it.\n\n1:33:27.900 --> 1:33:28.740\n You talked about it.\n\n1:33:28.740 --> 1:33:29.940\n You got excited.\n\n1:33:29.940 --> 1:33:31.780\n Amazon makes your life so easy.\n\n1:33:31.780 --> 1:33:34.260\n It's like, wow, I needed this thing\n\n1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:36.180\n and it showed up at my door two days later.\n\n1:33:36.180 --> 1:33:39.180\n And like both of these companies, by the way,\n\n1:33:39.180 --> 1:33:41.220\n Amazon, Apple have issues, right?\n\n1:33:41.220 --> 1:33:43.260\n There are labor issues,\n\n1:33:43.260 --> 1:33:45.380\n whether it's here in the US or in China,\n\n1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:48.380\n there are environmental issues.\n\n1:33:48.380 --> 1:33:49.620\n But like when's the last time\n\n1:33:49.620 --> 1:33:52.820\n you heard like a large chorus being like,\n\n1:33:52.820 --> 1:33:54.020\n these companies better pay\n\n1:33:54.020 --> 1:33:56.220\n for what they're doing on these things, right?\n\n1:33:56.220 --> 1:33:59.940\n I think Facebook's main issue today is like,\n\n1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:01.740\n you need to produce a hit.\n\n1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:03.780\n If you don't produce hits,\n\n1:34:03.780 --> 1:34:06.460\n it's really hard to keep consumers on your side.\n\n1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:08.300\n Then people just start picking on you\n\n1:34:08.300 --> 1:34:11.300\n for a variety of reasons, whether it's right or wrong.\n\n1:34:11.300 --> 1:34:12.580\n I'm not even going to place a judgment\n\n1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:13.420\n right here and right now.\n\n1:34:13.420 --> 1:34:17.140\n I'm just going to say that it is way better\n\n1:34:17.140 --> 1:34:19.180\n to be in a world where you are producing hits\n\n1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:21.900\n and consumers love what you're doing\n\n1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:23.460\n because then they're on your side.\n\n1:34:23.460 --> 1:34:26.580\n And I think that's, it's the past 10 years\n\n1:34:26.580 --> 1:34:29.900\n for Facebook has been fairly hard on this dimension.\n\n1:34:29.900 --> 1:34:33.020\n So, and by hits, it doesn't necessarily mean financial hits.\n\n1:34:33.020 --> 1:34:34.620\n It feels like to me, what you're saying\n\n1:34:34.620 --> 1:34:37.300\n is something that brings joy.\n\n1:34:37.300 --> 1:34:38.380\n A product that brings joy\n\n1:34:38.380 --> 1:34:40.100\n to some fraction of the population.\n\n1:34:40.100 --> 1:34:44.460\n Yeah, I mean, TikTok isn't just literally an algorithm.\n\n1:34:45.460 --> 1:34:49.460\n In some ways, TikTok's content and algorithm\n\n1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:53.420\n have more sway now over the American psyche\n\n1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:54.860\n than Facebook's algorithm, right?\n\n1:34:54.860 --> 1:34:57.220\n It's visual, it's video.\n\n1:34:57.220 --> 1:34:59.500\n By the way, it's not defined by who you follow.\n\n1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:01.340\n It's defined by some magical thing that,\n\n1:35:01.340 --> 1:35:02.700\n by the way, if someone wanted to tweak\n\n1:35:02.700 --> 1:35:05.540\n to show you a certain type of content for some reason,\n\n1:35:05.540 --> 1:35:09.820\n they could, right, but people love it.\n\n1:35:10.780 --> 1:35:13.940\n So as a CEO, let me ask you a question\n\n1:35:13.940 --> 1:35:15.580\n because leadership matters.\n\n1:35:17.700 --> 1:35:19.900\n This is a complicated question.\n\n1:35:19.900 --> 1:35:23.820\n Why is Mark Zuckerberg distrusted, disliked\n\n1:35:23.820 --> 1:35:27.060\n and sometimes even hated by many people in public?\n\n1:35:28.220 --> 1:35:30.180\n Right, that is a complicated question.\n\n1:35:30.180 --> 1:35:34.740\n Well, the premise, I'm not sure I agree with the premise.\n\n1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:38.100\n And I can expand that to include\n\n1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:42.300\n even a more mysterious question for me, Bill Gates.\n\n1:35:42.300 --> 1:35:43.140\n Hmm.\n\n1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:47.380\n What is the Bill Gates version of the question?\n\n1:35:47.380 --> 1:35:49.660\n Do you think people hate Bill Gates?\n\n1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:51.340\n No, distrust.\n\n1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:52.300\n Ah.\n\n1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:55.660\n So takeaway one, it's a checklist.\n\n1:35:56.780 --> 1:36:00.300\n There is, I think Mark Zuckerberg's distrust\n\n1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:04.220\n is the primary one, but there's also like a dislike,\n\n1:36:04.220 --> 1:36:05.580\n maybe hate is too strong a word,\n\n1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:09.020\n but it's just if you look at like the articles\n\n1:36:09.020 --> 1:36:13.500\n that are being written and so on, there's a dislike.\n\n1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:15.580\n And it makes, it's confusing to me\n\n1:36:15.580 --> 1:36:18.540\n because it's like the public picks certain individuals\n\n1:36:18.540 --> 1:36:21.940\n and they attach certain kinds of emotions\n\n1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:22.940\n to those individuals.\n\n1:36:22.940 --> 1:36:27.460\n Yeah, so someone once just recently said,\n\n1:36:27.460 --> 1:36:30.540\n there's a strong case that founder led companies\n\n1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:33.980\n have this problem and that a lot of Mark's issues\n\n1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:38.380\n come today come from the fact that he is a visible founder\n\n1:36:38.380 --> 1:36:42.940\n with this story that people have watched in both a movie\n\n1:36:42.940 --> 1:36:45.500\n and they followed along and he's this boy wonder kid\n\n1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:47.540\n who became one of the world's richest people\n\n1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:50.540\n and he's no longer Mark the person,\n\n1:36:50.540 --> 1:36:53.220\n he's Mark this image of a person\n\n1:36:53.220 --> 1:36:55.620\n with enormous wealth and power.\n\n1:36:55.620 --> 1:36:59.020\n And in today's world, we have issues\n\n1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:02.260\n with enormous wealth and power for a variety of reasons.\n\n1:37:02.260 --> 1:37:04.220\n One of which is we've been stuck inside\n\n1:37:05.260 --> 1:37:07.380\n for a year and a half, two years.\n\n1:37:07.380 --> 1:37:10.380\n One of which is a lot of people were really unhappy\n\n1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:13.860\n about not the last election, but the last, last election.\n\n1:37:13.860 --> 1:37:15.220\n And where do you take out that anger?\n\n1:37:15.220 --> 1:37:18.380\n Who do you blame but the people in charge?\n\n1:37:18.380 --> 1:37:21.220\n That's one example or one reason why I think\n\n1:37:22.260 --> 1:37:26.540\n a lot of people express anger or resentment\n\n1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:29.660\n or unhappiness with Mark.\n\n1:37:29.660 --> 1:37:31.620\n At the same time, I don't know,\n\n1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:34.020\n I pointed out to that person, I was like, well,\n\n1:37:34.020 --> 1:37:37.100\n I don't know, I think a lot of people really like Elon.\n\n1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:41.340\n Elon arguably, he kept his factory open here\n\n1:37:41.340 --> 1:37:44.380\n throughout COVID protocols, which arguably\n\n1:37:44.380 --> 1:37:47.180\n a lot of people would be against.\n\n1:37:47.180 --> 1:37:50.660\n While saying a bunch of crazy offensive things\n\n1:37:50.660 --> 1:37:52.300\n on the internet, they still.\n\n1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:56.940\n And basically gives the middle finger to the SEC\n\n1:37:56.940 --> 1:37:59.500\n on Twitter and I don't know, I'm like,\n\n1:37:59.500 --> 1:38:02.900\n well, there's a founder and like people kind of like him.\n\n1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:07.900\n So I do think that the founder and slash CEO\n\n1:38:09.100 --> 1:38:11.660\n of a company that's a social network company\n\n1:38:11.660 --> 1:38:13.820\n is like an extra level of difficulty.\n\n1:38:13.820 --> 1:38:15.420\n If life is a video game,\n\n1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:17.700\n you just chose the harder video game.\n\n1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:20.100\n So, I mean, that's why it's interesting to ask you\n\n1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:24.780\n because you were the founder and CEO of a social network.\n\n1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:25.860\n I challenge it because.\n\n1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:30.780\n Exactly, but you're one of the rare examples.\n\n1:38:30.780 --> 1:38:34.500\n Even Jack Dorsey's disliked, not to the degree,\n\n1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:35.860\n but it just seems harder\n\n1:38:35.860 --> 1:38:38.900\n when you're running a social media company.\n\n1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:39.740\n It's interesting.\n\n1:38:39.740 --> 1:38:41.380\n I never thought of Jack as just like,\n\n1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:43.980\n I think generally he's well respected.\n\n1:38:45.100 --> 1:38:45.940\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n1:38:45.940 --> 1:38:50.540\n I think you're right, but he's not loved.\n\n1:38:50.540 --> 1:38:51.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:51.380 --> 1:38:53.260\n And I feel like you, I mean, to me,\n\n1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:54.860\n Twitter is an incredible thing.\n\n1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:57.500\n Yeah, again, can I just come back to this point,\n\n1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:59.180\n which seems over simplistic,\n\n1:38:59.180 --> 1:39:04.180\n but I really do think how a product makes someone feel,\n\n1:39:04.940 --> 1:39:07.420\n they ascribe that feeling to the founder.\n\n1:39:07.420 --> 1:39:08.260\n Yep.\n\n1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:11.860\n So make people feel good.\n\n1:39:11.860 --> 1:39:13.020\n So think about it.\n\n1:39:13.020 --> 1:39:14.860\n Let's just go with this thesis for a second.\n\n1:39:14.860 --> 1:39:16.060\n Sure, I like it though.\n\n1:39:17.140 --> 1:39:19.580\n Amazon's pretty utilitarian, right?\n\n1:39:19.580 --> 1:39:21.540\n It delivers brown boxes to your front door.\n\n1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:23.420\n Sure, you can have Alexa\n\n1:39:23.420 --> 1:39:25.540\n and you can have all these things, right?\n\n1:39:25.540 --> 1:39:28.980\n But in general, it delivers stuff quickly to you\n\n1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:30.580\n at a reasonable price, right?\n\n1:39:31.460 --> 1:39:34.220\n I think Jeff Bezos is wonderfully wealthy,\n\n1:39:34.220 --> 1:39:36.660\n thoughtful, smart guy, right?\n\n1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:38.820\n But people kind of feel that way about him.\n\n1:39:38.820 --> 1:39:40.300\n They're like, wow, this is really big.\n\n1:39:40.300 --> 1:39:42.820\n We're impressed that this is really big.\n\n1:39:42.820 --> 1:39:45.820\n But he's doing the same space stuff Elon's doing,\n\n1:39:45.820 --> 1:39:47.220\n but they don't necessarily ascribe\n\n1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:50.060\n the same sense of wonder, right?\n\n1:39:50.060 --> 1:39:51.300\n Now let's take Elon.\n\n1:39:51.300 --> 1:39:52.860\n And again, this is pet theory.\n\n1:39:52.860 --> 1:39:55.460\n I don't have much proof other than my own intuition.\n\n1:39:56.460 --> 1:39:59.740\n He is literally about living the future.\n\n1:39:59.740 --> 1:40:01.980\n Mars, it's about wonder.\n\n1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:04.060\n It's about going back to that feeling as a kid\n\n1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:05.900\n when you looked up to the stars and asked,\n\n1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:08.140\n is there life out there?\n\n1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:11.060\n People get behind that because it's a sense of hope\n\n1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:13.460\n and excitement and innovation.\n\n1:40:13.460 --> 1:40:15.340\n And like, you can say whatever you want,\n\n1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:18.860\n but we ascribe that emotion to that person.\n\n1:40:18.860 --> 1:40:21.140\n Now, let's say you're on a social network\n\n1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:23.220\n and people make you kind of angry\n\n1:40:23.220 --> 1:40:24.380\n because they disagree with you\n\n1:40:24.380 --> 1:40:25.820\n or they say something ridiculous\n\n1:40:25.820 --> 1:40:28.580\n or they're living a FOMO type life where you're like,\n\n1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:30.340\n wow, I wish I was doing that thing.\n\n1:40:31.780 --> 1:40:33.980\n I think Instagram, if I were to think back,\n\n1:40:33.980 --> 1:40:35.900\n by and large, when I was there,\n\n1:40:35.900 --> 1:40:39.780\n was not about FOMO, was not about this influencer economy,\n\n1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:43.540\n although it certainly became that way closer to the end.\n\n1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:45.820\n It was about the sense of wonder and happiness\n\n1:40:45.820 --> 1:40:47.220\n and beautiful things in the world.\n\n1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:49.380\n And I don't know, I mean, like,\n\n1:40:49.380 --> 1:40:50.540\n I don't want to have a blind spot,\n\n1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:52.500\n but I don't think anyone had a strong opinion\n\n1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:53.620\n about me one way or the other.\n\n1:40:53.620 --> 1:40:55.660\n For the longest time, the way people explained to me,\n\n1:40:55.660 --> 1:40:57.580\n I mean, if you want to go for toxicity,\n\n1:40:57.580 --> 1:40:59.380\n you go to Facebook or Twitter.\n\n1:40:59.380 --> 1:41:01.820\n If you want to go to feel good about life,\n\n1:41:01.820 --> 1:41:04.460\n you go to Instagram to enjoy, celebrate life.\n\n1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:05.860\n And my experience been talking to people\n\n1:41:05.860 --> 1:41:08.340\n is they gave me the benefit of the doubt because of that.\n\n1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.020\n But if your experience of the product\n\n1:41:10.020 --> 1:41:13.660\n is kind of makes you angry, it's where you argue.\n\n1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:15.200\n I mean, a big part of Jack might be\n\n1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.780\n that he wasn't actually the CEO for a very long time\n\n1:41:17.780 --> 1:41:19.260\n and only became recently.\n\n1:41:19.260 --> 1:41:22.180\n So I'm not sure how much of the connection got made.\n\n1:41:23.660 --> 1:41:26.180\n But in general, I mean, if you hate,\n\n1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:29.620\n I'm just thinking about other companies\n\n1:41:29.620 --> 1:41:30.720\n that aren't tech companies.\n\n1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.580\n If you hate like what a company is doing\n\n1:41:32.580 --> 1:41:35.020\n or it makes you not feel happy.\n\n1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:37.860\n I don't know, like people are really angry\n\n1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:39.140\n about Comcast or whatever.\n\n1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:40.660\n Are they even called Comcast anymore?\n\n1:41:40.660 --> 1:41:42.100\n It's like Xfinity or something, right?\n\n1:41:42.100 --> 1:41:43.300\n They had to rebrand.\n\n1:41:43.300 --> 1:41:44.620\n They became meta, right?\n\n1:41:44.620 --> 1:41:48.580\n And it's like, but my point is if it makes you angry.\n\n1:41:48.580 --> 1:41:50.020\n That's beautiful, yeah.\n\n1:41:50.020 --> 1:41:54.940\n But the thing is, this is me saying this.\n\n1:41:54.940 --> 1:41:58.780\n I think your thesis is very strong and correct,\n\n1:41:58.780 --> 1:42:00.100\n has elements of correctness,\n\n1:42:00.100 --> 1:42:05.100\n but I still personally put some blame on individuals.\n\n1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:06.380\n Of course.\n\n1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:10.360\n I think you said, Elon, looking up,\n\n1:42:10.360 --> 1:42:13.500\n there's something about Childlike Wander to him,\n\n1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:16.400\n like to his personality, his character,\n\n1:42:16.400 --> 1:42:19.900\n something about, I think more so than others\n\n1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:21.260\n where people can trust them.\n\n1:42:21.260 --> 1:42:23.060\n And there's, I don't know,\n\n1:42:23.060 --> 1:42:26.460\n Sondra Prachai is an example of somebody who's like,\n\n1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:29.660\n there's some kind, it's hard to put into words,\n\n1:42:29.660 --> 1:42:32.120\n but there's something about the human being\n\n1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.300\n where he's trustworthy.\n\n1:42:34.300 --> 1:42:38.260\n He's human in a way that connects to us.\n\n1:42:38.260 --> 1:42:40.820\n And the same with Sajid Nadella.\n\n1:42:40.820 --> 1:42:45.820\n I mean, some of these folks, something about us\n\n1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:48.500\n is drawn to them, even when they're flawed.\n\n1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:53.100\n Even like, so your thesis really holds up for Steve Jobs\n\n1:42:53.100 --> 1:42:55.080\n because I think people didn't like Steve Jobs,\n\n1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:57.460\n but he delivered products\n\n1:42:57.460 --> 1:42:59.520\n and then they fell in love every time.\n\n1:43:01.060 --> 1:43:03.040\n I guess you could say that the CEO,\n\n1:43:03.040 --> 1:43:05.820\n the leader is also a product.\n\n1:43:05.820 --> 1:43:08.980\n And if they keep delivering a product that people like\n\n1:43:08.980 --> 1:43:11.460\n by being in public and saying things that people like,\n\n1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:14.660\n that's also a way to make people happy.\n\n1:43:14.660 --> 1:43:16.260\n But from a social network perspective,\n\n1:43:16.260 --> 1:43:19.860\n it makes me wonder how difficult it is\n\n1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:22.100\n to explain to people why certain things happen,\n\n1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:24.500\n like to explain machine learning,\n\n1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:27.180\n to explain why certain,\n\n1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:32.480\n the woke mob effect happens\n\n1:43:32.480 --> 1:43:36.420\n or the certain kinds of like bullying happens,\n\n1:43:36.420 --> 1:43:40.780\n which is like, it's human nature combined with algorithm.\n\n1:43:40.780 --> 1:43:42.560\n And it's very difficult to control for\n\n1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:45.620\n how the spread of quote unquote misinformation happens.\n\n1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:47.700\n It's very difficult to control for that.\n\n1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:50.500\n And so you try to decelerate certain parts\n\n1:43:50.500 --> 1:43:53.700\n and you create more problems than you solve.\n\n1:43:53.700 --> 1:43:55.820\n And anything that looks at all like censorship\n\n1:43:55.820 --> 1:43:58.820\n can create huge amounts of problems as a slippery slope.\n\n1:43:58.820 --> 1:44:01.100\n And then you have to inject humans\n\n1:44:01.100 --> 1:44:03.180\n to oversee the machine learning algorithms.\n\n1:44:03.180 --> 1:44:05.540\n And anytime you inject humans into the system,\n\n1:44:05.540 --> 1:44:07.220\n it's gonna create a huge number of problems.\n\n1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:08.780\n And I feel like it's up to the leader\n\n1:44:08.780 --> 1:44:12.780\n to communicate that effectively, to be transparent.\n\n1:44:12.780 --> 1:44:13.960\n First of all, design products\n\n1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:15.180\n that don't have those problems.\n\n1:44:15.180 --> 1:44:17.500\n And second of all, when they have those problems,\n\n1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:19.060\n to be able to communicate with them.\n\n1:44:19.060 --> 1:44:21.100\n I guess that's all going to,\n\n1:44:21.100 --> 1:44:25.060\n when you run a social network company, your job is hard.\n\n1:44:25.060 --> 1:44:28.780\n Yeah, I will say the one element that you haven't named\n\n1:44:28.780 --> 1:44:31.660\n that I think you're getting at is just bedside manner,\n\n1:44:31.660 --> 1:44:35.460\n which Steve Jobs, I never worked for him.\n\n1:44:35.460 --> 1:44:37.000\n I never met him in person.\n\n1:44:38.580 --> 1:44:43.580\n Had an uncanny ability in public to have bedside manner.\n\n1:44:43.620 --> 1:44:46.500\n I mean, some of the best clips of Steve Jobs\n\n1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:49.500\n from like, I would say maybe the 80s\n\n1:44:49.500 --> 1:44:51.980\n when he's on the stage and getting questions\n\n1:44:51.980 --> 1:44:53.460\n from the audience about life.\n\n1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:56.600\n And he'll take this question that is like,\n\n1:44:56.600 --> 1:44:58.420\n how are you gonna compete with blah?\n\n1:44:58.420 --> 1:44:59.460\n And it's super boring.\n\n1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:01.480\n And I don't even know the name of the company.\n\n1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.360\n And his answer is as if you just asked your grandfather,\n\n1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:06.300\n the meaning of life.\n\n1:45:07.420 --> 1:45:10.220\n And you sit there and you're just like, what?\n\n1:45:10.220 --> 1:45:11.820\n And there's that bedside manner.\n\n1:45:13.220 --> 1:45:16.980\n And if you lack that, or if that's just not intuitive to you,\n\n1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:20.260\n I think that it can be a lot harder\n\n1:45:20.260 --> 1:45:21.500\n to gain the trust of people.\n\n1:45:21.500 --> 1:45:25.200\n And then add on top of that, missteps of companies.\n\n1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:29.060\n I don't know if you have any friends from the past\n\n1:45:29.060 --> 1:45:31.360\n where maybe they crossed you once,\n\n1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:34.380\n or maybe you get back together and you're friends again,\n\n1:45:34.380 --> 1:45:36.900\n but you just never really forget that thing.\n\n1:45:36.900 --> 1:45:38.880\n It's human nature not to forget.\n\n1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:40.700\n I'm Russian, you crossed me once.\n\n1:45:41.780 --> 1:45:43.340\n We solved the problem.\n\n1:45:43.340 --> 1:45:48.340\n So my point is, humans don't forget.\n\n1:45:48.900 --> 1:45:50.380\n And if there are times in the past\n\n1:45:50.380 --> 1:45:52.180\n where they feel like they don't trust the company\n\n1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:54.020\n or the company hasn't had their back,\n\n1:45:55.180 --> 1:45:57.060\n that is really hard to earn back,\n\n1:45:57.060 --> 1:46:00.000\n especially if you don't have that bedside manner.\n\n1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.900\n And again, I'm not attributing this specifically to Marc\n\n1:46:02.900 --> 1:46:06.380\n because I think a lot of the companies have this issue\n\n1:46:06.380 --> 1:46:10.620\n where one, you have to be trustworthy as a company\n\n1:46:10.620 --> 1:46:12.620\n and live by it and live by those actions.\n\n1:46:12.620 --> 1:46:14.540\n And then two, I think you need to be able\n\n1:46:14.540 --> 1:46:18.100\n to be really relatable in a way that's very difficult\n\n1:46:18.100 --> 1:46:20.560\n if you're worth what these people are.\n\n1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:22.060\n It's really hard.\n\n1:46:22.060 --> 1:46:23.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:23.220 --> 1:46:27.020\n Jack does a pretty good job of this by being a monk.\n\n1:46:27.020 --> 1:46:29.740\n But I also, Jack issues attention.\n\n1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:32.100\n He's not out there almost on purpose.\n\n1:46:32.100 --> 1:46:35.300\n He's just working hard, doing square, right?\n\n1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:38.140\n I literally shared a desk like this with him at Odeo.\n\n1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:41.220\n I mean, this normal guy who likes painting,\n\n1:46:41.220 --> 1:46:45.000\n I remember he would leave early on Wednesdays or something\n\n1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.340\n to go to a painting class.\n\n1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:49.380\n And he's creative, he's thoughtful.\n\n1:46:49.380 --> 1:46:53.340\n I mean, money makes people more creative and more thoughtful,\n\n1:46:53.340 --> 1:46:55.980\n extreme versions of themselves, right?\n\n1:46:55.980 --> 1:46:58.300\n And this was a long, long time ago.\n\n1:46:58.300 --> 1:47:00.540\n You mentioned that he asked you\n\n1:47:00.540 --> 1:47:02.740\n to do some kind of JavaScript thing.\n\n1:47:02.740 --> 1:47:05.220\n We were working on some JavaScript together.\n\n1:47:05.220 --> 1:47:08.020\n That's hilarious, like pre Twitter, early Twitter days,\n\n1:47:08.020 --> 1:47:11.220\n you and Jack Dorsey are in a room together\n\n1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:12.780\n talking about JavaScript,\n\n1:47:12.780 --> 1:47:14.780\n solving some kind of menial problem.\n\n1:47:14.780 --> 1:47:15.860\n Terrible problems, yeah.\n\n1:47:15.860 --> 1:47:18.420\n I mean, not terrible, just like boring widget problem.\n\n1:47:18.420 --> 1:47:19.660\n I think it was the Odeo widget\n\n1:47:19.660 --> 1:47:21.660\n we were working on at the time.\n\n1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:24.800\n I'm surprised anyone paid me to be in the room as an intern\n\n1:47:24.800 --> 1:47:26.500\n because I didn't really provide any value.\n\n1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:30.440\n I'm very thankful to anyone who included me back in the day.\n\n1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:32.220\n It was very helpful.\n\n1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:33.780\n So thank you for listening.\n\n1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:37.720\n I mean, is there Odeo that's a precursor to Twitter?\n\n1:47:38.820 --> 1:47:40.700\n First of all, did you have any anticipation\n\n1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:43.580\n that this Jack Dorsey guy could be also\n\n1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:46.180\n a head of a major social network?\n\n1:47:46.180 --> 1:47:49.420\n And second, did you learn anything from the guy that,\n\n1:47:49.420 --> 1:47:52.460\n like, do you think it's a coincidence\n\n1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:54.380\n that you two were in the room together?\n\n1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:58.900\n And it's the coincidence meaning like,\n\n1:47:58.900 --> 1:48:01.700\n why does the world play its game in a certain way\n\n1:48:01.700 --> 1:48:04.100\n where these two founders of social networks?\n\n1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:04.940\n I don't know.\n\n1:48:04.940 --> 1:48:05.820\n It's so weird, right?\n\n1:48:05.820 --> 1:48:10.820\n Like, I mean, it's also weird that Mark showed up\n\n1:48:11.900 --> 1:48:13.940\n in our fraternity my sophomore year\n\n1:48:13.940 --> 1:48:16.340\n and we got to know each other then,\n\n1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:18.060\n like long before Instagram.\n\n1:48:18.060 --> 1:48:20.620\n It's a small world,\n\n1:48:20.620 --> 1:48:23.640\n but let me tell a fun story about Jack.\n\n1:48:25.100 --> 1:48:27.260\n We're at Odeo and I don't know,\n\n1:48:27.260 --> 1:48:28.900\n I think Ev was feeling like people\n\n1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:31.340\n weren't working hard enough or something.\n\n1:48:31.340 --> 1:48:32.180\n Nice.\n\n1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:35.100\n And I can't remember exactly what he,\n\n1:48:35.100 --> 1:48:39.180\n he created this thing where every Friday,\n\n1:48:39.180 --> 1:48:40.380\n I don't know if it was every Friday,\n\n1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:43.140\n I only remember this happening once,\n\n1:48:43.140 --> 1:48:47.540\n but he had us like a statuette, it's like of Mary.\n\n1:48:47.540 --> 1:48:50.740\n And in the bottom, it's hollow, right?\n\n1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:54.260\n And I remember on a Friday,\n\n1:48:54.260 --> 1:48:57.300\n Ev decided he was going to let everyone vote for\n\n1:48:57.300 --> 1:48:59.600\n who had worked the hardest that week.\n\n1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:01.380\n We all voted, closed ballot, right?\n\n1:49:01.380 --> 1:49:04.420\n We all put it in a bucket and he tallied the votes.\n\n1:49:04.420 --> 1:49:07.820\n And then whoever got the most votes, as I recall,\n\n1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:09.860\n got the statuette.\n\n1:49:09.860 --> 1:49:12.280\n And in the statuette was a thousand bucks,\n\n1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:14.380\n or I recall there was a thousand bucks in it.\n\n1:49:14.380 --> 1:49:15.280\n It might've been a hundred bucks,\n\n1:49:15.280 --> 1:49:16.220\n but let's call it a thousand.\n\n1:49:16.220 --> 1:49:17.060\n It's more exciting that way.\n\n1:49:17.060 --> 1:49:18.020\n It felt like a thousand, yeah.\n\n1:49:18.020 --> 1:49:19.420\n It did to me for sure.\n\n1:49:19.420 --> 1:49:20.560\n I actually got two votes.\n\n1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:21.400\n I was very happy.\n\n1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:23.180\n We were a small company, but as the intern,\n\n1:49:23.180 --> 1:49:24.020\n I got at least two votes.\n\n1:49:24.020 --> 1:49:26.260\n So everybody knew how many votes they got individually?\n\n1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:27.100\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:49:27.100 --> 1:49:29.060\n And I think it was one of these self accountability things.\n\n1:49:29.060 --> 1:49:31.420\n Anyway, I remember Jack just getting\n\n1:49:31.420 --> 1:49:34.180\n like the vast majority of votes from everyone.\n\n1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:37.100\n And I remember just thinking like,\n\n1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:39.740\n like I couldn't imagine he would become what he'd become\n\n1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:41.140\n and do what he would do,\n\n1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:45.640\n but I had a profound respect that the new guy\n\n1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:48.820\n who I really liked worked that hard.\n\n1:49:48.820 --> 1:49:51.720\n And you could see his dedication even then\n\n1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:53.860\n and that people respected him.\n\n1:49:53.860 --> 1:49:55.660\n That's the one story that I remember of him\n\n1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:58.000\n like working with him specifically from that summer.\n\n1:49:58.000 --> 1:49:59.500\n Can I take a small tangent on that?\n\n1:49:59.500 --> 1:50:00.340\n Of course.\n\n1:50:00.340 --> 1:50:02.020\n There's kind of a pushback in Silicon Valley\n\n1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:04.380\n a little bit against hard work.\n\n1:50:04.380 --> 1:50:08.380\n Can you speak to the sort of the thing you admire\n\n1:50:08.380 --> 1:50:11.420\n to see the new guy working so hard, that thing?\n\n1:50:11.420 --> 1:50:13.740\n What is the value of that thing in a company?\n\n1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:16.420\n See, this is like, just to be very frank,\n\n1:50:16.420 --> 1:50:17.720\n it drives me nuts.\n\n1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:21.860\n Like I saw this really funny video on TikTok.\n\n1:50:21.860 --> 1:50:22.680\n Was it on TikTok?\n\n1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:24.940\n It was like, I'm taking a break from my mental health\n\n1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:26.300\n to work on my career.\n\n1:50:26.300 --> 1:50:27.460\n I thought that was funny.\n\n1:50:27.460 --> 1:50:31.700\n Um, so I was like, oh, it is kind of phrased that way,\n\n1:50:31.700 --> 1:50:32.980\n the opposite often, right?\n\n1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:33.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:33.820 --> 1:50:35.180\n Okay, so a couple of things.\n\n1:50:35.180 --> 1:50:40.180\n Uh, I, uh, I have worked so hard\n\n1:50:42.380 --> 1:50:43.680\n to do the things that I did.\n\n1:50:43.680 --> 1:50:47.580\n Like Mike and I lost years off of our lives,\n\n1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:50.140\n staying up late, figuring things out,\n\n1:50:50.140 --> 1:50:51.700\n the stress that comes with the job.\n\n1:50:51.700 --> 1:50:54.800\n I have a lot more gray hair now than I did back then.\n\n1:50:54.800 --> 1:50:57.100\n It requires an enormous amount of work\n\n1:50:57.100 --> 1:50:59.460\n and most people aren't successful, right?\n\n1:50:59.460 --> 1:51:01.640\n But even the ones that do don't skate by.\n\n1:51:04.300 --> 1:51:07.220\n I am okay if people choose not to work hard\n\n1:51:07.220 --> 1:51:09.020\n because I don't actually think there's anything\n\n1:51:09.020 --> 1:51:11.360\n in this world that says you have to work hard.\n\n1:51:13.140 --> 1:51:16.420\n But I do think that great things require a lot of hard work.\n\n1:51:16.420 --> 1:51:18.640\n So there's no way you can expect to change the world\n\n1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:19.700\n without working really hard.\n\n1:51:19.700 --> 1:51:22.560\n By the way, even changing the world,\n\n1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:24.260\n you know, the folks that I respect the most\n\n1:51:24.260 --> 1:51:27.220\n have nudged the world in like a slight direction,\n\n1:51:27.220 --> 1:51:29.460\n slight, very, very slight.\n\n1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:33.940\n Like even if Elon accomplishes all the things\n\n1:51:33.940 --> 1:51:34.920\n he wants to accomplish,\n\n1:51:34.920 --> 1:51:38.420\n we will have nudged the world in a slight direction,\n\n1:51:38.420 --> 1:51:40.120\n but it requires enormous amount.\n\n1:51:40.120 --> 1:51:43.140\n There was an interview with him where he was just like,\n\n1:51:43.140 --> 1:51:45.020\n he was interviewed, I think, at the Tesla factory\n\n1:51:45.020 --> 1:51:47.500\n and he was like, work is really hard.\n\n1:51:47.500 --> 1:51:49.380\n This is actually unhealthy.\n\n1:51:49.380 --> 1:51:51.220\n And I can't recall the exact,\n\n1:51:51.220 --> 1:51:52.860\n but he was like visibly shaken\n\n1:51:52.860 --> 1:51:54.220\n about how hard he had been working.\n\n1:51:54.220 --> 1:51:55.860\n And he was like, this is bad.\n\n1:51:55.860 --> 1:51:57.620\n And unfortunately, I think to have great outcomes,\n\n1:51:57.620 --> 1:51:58.900\n you actually do need to work\n\n1:51:58.900 --> 1:52:01.840\n at like three standard deviations above the mean,\n\n1:52:01.840 --> 1:52:03.980\n but there's nothing saying that people have to go for that.\n\n1:52:03.980 --> 1:52:06.420\n See, the thing is, but what I would argue,\n\n1:52:06.420 --> 1:52:08.080\n this is my personal opinion,\n\n1:52:08.080 --> 1:52:10.460\n is nobody has to do anything, first of all.\n\n1:52:10.460 --> 1:52:12.340\n They certainly don't have to work hard.\n\n1:52:12.340 --> 1:52:17.340\n But I think hard work in a company should be admired.\n\n1:52:17.340 --> 1:52:20.340\n And you should not feel like,\n\n1:52:22.340 --> 1:52:26.340\n you shouldn't feel good about yourself for not working hard.\n\n1:52:26.340 --> 1:52:30.140\n Like, so for example, I don't have to work out.\n\n1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:31.860\n I don't have to run.\n\n1:52:31.860 --> 1:52:35.580\n I hate running, but like, I certainly don't feel good\n\n1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:37.540\n if I don't run because I know for my health,\n\n1:52:37.540 --> 1:52:39.020\n like there's certain values,\n\n1:52:39.020 --> 1:52:40.340\n I guess is what I'm trying to get at.\n\n1:52:40.340 --> 1:52:42.180\n There's certain values that you have in life.\n\n1:52:42.180 --> 1:52:43.580\n It feels like there's certain values\n\n1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:45.380\n that companies should have in hard work.\n\n1:52:45.380 --> 1:52:47.700\n Certain values that companies should have in hard work\n\n1:52:47.700 --> 1:52:51.460\n is one of the things I think that should be admired.\n\n1:52:51.460 --> 1:52:53.680\n I often ask this kind of silly question,\n\n1:52:54.540 --> 1:52:56.560\n just to get a sense of people,\n\n1:52:56.560 --> 1:52:58.580\n like if I'm hiring and so on.\n\n1:52:58.580 --> 1:53:00.860\n I just ask if they think it's better\n\n1:53:00.860 --> 1:53:03.140\n to work hard or work smart.\n\n1:53:03.140 --> 1:53:07.420\n It was helpful for me to get a sense of people from that.\n\n1:53:07.420 --> 1:53:08.260\n Because you think like the right.\n\n1:53:08.260 --> 1:53:09.740\n The answer's both.\n\n1:53:09.740 --> 1:53:10.560\n What's that?\n\n1:53:10.560 --> 1:53:11.400\n The answer's both.\n\n1:53:11.400 --> 1:53:12.240\n The answer's both.\n\n1:53:12.240 --> 1:53:13.900\n I usually try not to give them that,\n\n1:53:13.900 --> 1:53:16.900\n but sometimes I'll say both if that's an option.\n\n1:53:16.900 --> 1:53:19.780\n But a lot of people kind of,\n\n1:53:19.780 --> 1:53:22.060\n a surprising number will say work smart.\n\n1:53:22.060 --> 1:53:23.380\n And there are usually people\n\n1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:25.840\n who don't know how to work smart.\n\n1:53:26.700 --> 1:53:29.580\n And they're literally just lazy.\n\n1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:32.260\n Not just, there's two effects behind that.\n\n1:53:32.260 --> 1:53:36.420\n One is laziness and the other is ego.\n\n1:53:37.300 --> 1:53:40.420\n When you're younger and you say it's better to work smart,\n\n1:53:40.420 --> 1:53:44.220\n it means you think you know what it means\n\n1:53:44.220 --> 1:53:46.820\n to work smart at this early stage.\n\n1:53:46.820 --> 1:53:49.940\n To me, people that say work hard or both,\n\n1:53:49.940 --> 1:53:52.360\n they have the humility to understand like,\n\n1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:54.340\n I'm going to have to work my ass off\n\n1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:56.820\n because I'm too dumb to know how to work smart.\n\n1:53:56.820 --> 1:53:59.140\n And people who are self critical in this way,\n\n1:53:59.140 --> 1:54:01.480\n in some small amount, you have to have some confidence.\n\n1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:03.860\n But if you have humility,\n\n1:54:03.860 --> 1:54:06.420\n that means you're going to actually eventually figure out\n\n1:54:06.420 --> 1:54:07.500\n what it means to work smart.\n\n1:54:07.500 --> 1:54:11.220\n And then to actually be successful, you should do both.\n\n1:54:11.220 --> 1:54:14.060\n So I have a very particular take on this,\n\n1:54:14.060 --> 1:54:19.060\n which is that no one's forcing you to do anything.\n\n1:54:19.820 --> 1:54:22.260\n All choices have consequences.\n\n1:54:22.260 --> 1:54:27.260\n So if you major in, I don't know, theoretical literature,\n\n1:54:27.540 --> 1:54:28.900\n I don't even know if that's a major.\n\n1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:30.020\n I'm just making something up.\n\n1:54:30.020 --> 1:54:33.580\n That's supposed to regular literature, applied literature.\n\n1:54:33.580 --> 1:54:38.300\n Yeah, think about like theoretical Spanish lit\n\n1:54:38.300 --> 1:54:39.420\n from the 14th century.\n\n1:54:39.420 --> 1:54:41.740\n Like just make up your esoteric thing.\n\n1:54:41.740 --> 1:54:44.300\n And then the number of people I went to Stanford with\n\n1:54:44.300 --> 1:54:45.360\n who get out in the world and they're like,\n\n1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:47.260\n wait, what, I can't find a job?\n\n1:54:47.260 --> 1:54:49.020\n Like no one wants a theoretical,\n\n1:54:49.020 --> 1:54:51.660\n like there are plenty of counter examples\n\n1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:53.380\n of people who have majored in esoteric things\n\n1:54:53.380 --> 1:54:54.840\n and gone on to be very successful.\n\n1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:56.700\n So I just want to be clear, it's not about the major.\n\n1:54:56.700 --> 1:55:00.820\n But every choice you make, whether it's to have kids,\n\n1:55:00.820 --> 1:55:02.900\n like I love my children.\n\n1:55:02.900 --> 1:55:04.660\n It's so awesome to have two kids.\n\n1:55:04.660 --> 1:55:08.060\n And it is so hard to work really hard and also have kids.\n\n1:55:08.060 --> 1:55:09.420\n It's really hard.\n\n1:55:09.420 --> 1:55:12.640\n And there's a reason why certain very successful people\n\n1:55:12.640 --> 1:55:14.560\n like don't have, or not successful,\n\n1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:17.460\n but people who run very, very large companies or startups\n\n1:55:17.460 --> 1:55:19.180\n have chosen not to have kids for a while\n\n1:55:19.180 --> 1:55:21.620\n or chosen not to like prioritize them.\n\n1:55:21.620 --> 1:55:22.620\n Everything's a choice.\n\n1:55:22.620 --> 1:55:24.900\n And like I choose to prioritize my children\n\n1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:27.780\n because like I want to do that, right?\n\n1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:29.420\n So everything's a choice.\n\n1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:33.120\n Now, once you've made that choice,\n\n1:55:33.120 --> 1:55:36.160\n I think it's important that the contract is clear,\n\n1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.000\n which is to say,\n\n1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.120\n let's imagine you were joining a new startup.\n\n1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:43.520\n It's important that that startup communicate\n\n1:55:43.520 --> 1:55:44.720\n that like the expectation is like,\n\n1:55:44.720 --> 1:55:46.440\n we're all working really, really hard right now.\n\n1:55:46.440 --> 1:55:48.760\n You don't have to join the startup.\n\n1:55:48.760 --> 1:55:51.480\n But like, if you do just know like you're,\n\n1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.720\n it's almost as if you join, I don't know,\n\n1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:57.960\n pick your like sports team.\n\n1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.840\n Like let's go back to the Yankees for a second.\n\n1:56:00.840 --> 1:56:01.880\n You want to join the Yankees,\n\n1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:03.640\n but you don't really want to work that hard.\n\n1:56:03.640 --> 1:56:05.780\n You don't really want to do batting practice\n\n1:56:05.780 --> 1:56:08.640\n or pitching practice or whatever for your position, right?\n\n1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:11.400\n That to me is wacko.\n\n1:56:11.400 --> 1:56:13.920\n And that's actually the world that it feels like we live in\n\n1:56:13.920 --> 1:56:15.240\n in tech sometimes,\n\n1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.080\n where people both want to work for the Yankees\n\n1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:18.480\n because it pays a lot,\n\n1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:21.100\n but like don't actually want to work that hard.\n\n1:56:21.100 --> 1:56:23.300\n That I don't fully understand.\n\n1:56:23.300 --> 1:56:26.000\n Because if you sign up for some of these things,\n\n1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:26.840\n just sign up for it.\n\n1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:29.020\n But it's okay if you don't want to sign up for it.\n\n1:56:29.020 --> 1:56:31.720\n There's so many wonderful careers in this world\n\n1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:33.780\n that don't require 80 hours a week.\n\n1:56:33.780 --> 1:56:35.280\n But when I read about companies going to like\n\n1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:36.520\n four day work weeks and stuff,\n\n1:56:36.520 --> 1:56:39.800\n I just like, I chuckle because I can't get enough done\n\n1:56:39.800 --> 1:56:41.080\n with a seven day week.\n\n1:56:41.080 --> 1:56:42.820\n I don't know how.\n\n1:56:42.820 --> 1:56:44.920\n And people will say, oh, you're just not working smart.\n\n1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:46.600\n And it's like, no, I work pretty smart,\n\n1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:47.560\n I think in general.\n\n1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.340\n Like I wouldn't have gotten to this point\n\n1:56:49.340 --> 1:56:52.760\n if I hadn't like some amount of working smart.\n\n1:56:52.760 --> 1:56:53.840\n And there is balance though.\n\n1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:55.880\n So I used to be like a pretty big cyclist.\n\n1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:58.240\n I don't do it much anymore just because of kids\n\n1:56:58.240 --> 1:57:00.280\n and like prioritizing other things, right?\n\n1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:03.380\n But one of the most important things to learn\n\n1:57:03.380 --> 1:57:06.140\n as a cyclist is to take a rest day.\n\n1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:07.640\n But to me and to cyclists,\n\n1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:12.640\n like resting is a function of optimizing for the long run.\n\n1:57:12.680 --> 1:57:16.240\n It's not like a thing that you do for its own merits.\n\n1:57:16.240 --> 1:57:17.880\n It's actually like, if you don't rest,\n\n1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:18.880\n your muscles don't recover.\n\n1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:19.880\n And then you're just not as,\n\n1:57:19.880 --> 1:57:21.520\n like you're not training as efficiently.\n\n1:57:21.520 --> 1:57:24.680\n You should probably, the successful people I've known\n\n1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:27.160\n in terms of athletes, they hate rest days,\n\n1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:29.800\n but they know they have to do it for the long term.\n\n1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:32.560\n They think their opposition is getting stronger and stronger\n\n1:57:32.560 --> 1:57:34.360\n and that's the feeling,\n\n1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.000\n but you know it's the right thing\n\n1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:38.200\n and usually you need a coach to help you.\n\n1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:39.040\n Yeah, totally.\n\n1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:41.240\n So, I mean, I use this thing called training peaks\n\n1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:42.080\n and it's interesting\n\n1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:44.060\n because it actually mathematically shows\n\n1:57:44.060 --> 1:57:46.800\n like where you are on the curve and all this stuff,\n\n1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:49.400\n but you have to have that rest,\n\n1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:52.320\n but it's a function of going harder for longer.\n\n1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:53.840\n Again, it's this reinforcement learning,\n\n1:57:53.840 --> 1:57:56.480\n like planning the aggregate and the long,\n\n1:57:56.480 --> 1:57:58.600\n but a lot of people will hide behind laziness\n\n1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.880\n by saying that they're trying to optimize for the long run\n\n1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:03.200\n and they're not, they're just not working very hard.\n\n1:58:03.200 --> 1:58:05.040\n But again, you don't have to sign up for it.\n\n1:58:05.040 --> 1:58:05.880\n It's totally cool.\n\n1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:07.420\n Like, I don't think less of people\n\n1:58:07.420 --> 1:58:08.960\n for like not working super hard.\n\n1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:10.280\n It's just like, don't sign up for things\n\n1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:11.880\n that require working super hard.\n\n1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:13.920\n And some of that requires for the leadership\n\n1:58:13.920 --> 1:58:17.080\n to have the guts, the boldness to communicate effectively\n\n1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:17.920\n at the very beginning.\n\n1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:20.760\n I mean, sometimes I think most of the problems arise\n\n1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:24.600\n in the fact that the leadership is kind of hesitant\n\n1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:29.600\n to communicate the socially difficult truth\n\n1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:33.840\n of what it takes to be at this company.\n\n1:58:33.840 --> 1:58:36.520\n So they kind of say, hey, come with us.\n\n1:58:36.520 --> 1:58:39.480\n There's, we have snacks, you know, but.\n\n1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:40.800\n Unlimited vacation and.\n\n1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:41.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:44.240\n You know, Ray at Bridgewater is always fascinating\n\n1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:45.640\n because, you know, people,\n\n1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:47.920\n it's been called like a cult on the outside\n\n1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:49.860\n or cultish and,\n\n1:58:49.860 --> 1:58:51.000\n but what's fascinating is like,\n\n1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:52.800\n they just don't give on their principles.\n\n1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:55.240\n They're like, listen, this is what it's like to work here.\n\n1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:57.320\n We record every meeting.\n\n1:58:57.320 --> 1:58:59.280\n We're like brutally honest\n\n1:58:59.280 --> 1:59:00.920\n and that's not going to feel right to everyone.\n\n1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:03.440\n And if it doesn't feel right to you, totally cool.\n\n1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:04.880\n Just go work somewhere else.\n\n1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:08.040\n But if you work here, you are signing up for this.\n\n1:59:08.040 --> 1:59:10.400\n And that's, that's been fascinating to me\n\n1:59:10.400 --> 1:59:12.200\n because it's honesty upfront.\n\n1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:15.480\n It's a system in which you operate.\n\n1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:16.720\n And if it's not for you,\n\n1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:19.600\n like no one's forcing you to work there, right?\n\n1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:20.440\n I actually did.\n\n1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:22.280\n So I did a conversation with him\n\n1:59:22.280 --> 1:59:25.140\n and kind of got stuck in a funny moment,\n\n1:59:25.140 --> 1:59:28.360\n which is at the end I asked him, you know,\n\n1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:31.420\n to give me honest feedback of how I did on the interview.\n\n1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:32.260\n And I was.\n\n1:59:32.260 --> 1:59:33.440\n Did he?\n\n1:59:33.440 --> 1:59:34.760\n I don't think so.\n\n1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.200\n He was super nice.\n\n1:59:36.200 --> 1:59:38.760\n He asked me, he's like, well,\n\n1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:40.120\n tell me, did you accomplish\n\n1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:42.040\n what you were hoping to accomplish?\n\n1:59:42.040 --> 1:59:44.040\n I was like, that's not, that's not.\n\n1:59:45.080 --> 1:59:47.880\n I'm asking you as an objective observer\n\n1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:50.740\n of two people talking, how do we do today?\n\n1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:53.760\n And then he's like, well,\n\n1:59:53.760 --> 1:59:55.240\n he gave me this politician answer.\n\n1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:57.200\n Well, I feel like we've accomplished\n\n1:59:57.200 --> 2:00:00.280\n successful communication of like ideas,\n\n2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:03.600\n which is I'd love to spread some of the ideas\n\n2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:06.880\n in that, like in principles and so on.\n\n2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:07.720\n I was like.\n\n2:00:07.720 --> 2:00:08.760\n Back to my original point,\n\n2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:10.000\n it's really hard to get.\n\n2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.880\n Even for Radalia.\n\n2:00:11.880 --> 2:00:13.880\n It's really hard to give feedback.\n\n2:00:13.880 --> 2:00:15.720\n And one of the other things I learned from him\n\n2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:18.780\n and just people in that world is like,\n\n2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:22.120\n man, humans really like to pretend\n\n2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:23.800\n like they've come to,\n\n2:00:24.700 --> 2:00:27.080\n that they've come to some kind of meeting of the minds.\n\n2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:30.120\n Like if there's conflict, if you and I have conflict,\n\n2:00:30.120 --> 2:00:32.620\n it's always better to meet face to face, right?\n\n2:00:32.620 --> 2:00:33.720\n We're on the phone.\n\n2:00:33.720 --> 2:00:35.240\n Slack is not great, right?\n\n2:00:35.240 --> 2:00:37.160\n Email is not great, but face to face.\n\n2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:38.680\n What's crazy is you and I get together\n\n2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:40.660\n and we actively try to,\n\n2:00:40.660 --> 2:00:43.080\n even if we're not actually solving the conflict,\n\n2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:45.880\n we actively try to paper over the conflict.\n\n2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:48.620\n Oh yeah, it didn't really bother me that much.\n\n2:00:48.620 --> 2:00:50.840\n Oh yeah, I'm sure you didn't mean it.\n\n2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:54.320\n But like, no, in our minds we're still there.\n\n2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:56.200\n So this is one of the things that as a leader,\n\n2:00:56.200 --> 2:00:58.420\n you always have to be digging,\n\n2:00:58.420 --> 2:00:59.260\n especially as you ascend.\n\n2:00:59.260 --> 2:01:00.880\n Like straight to the conflict.\n\n2:01:00.880 --> 2:01:02.040\n Yeah, but as you ascend,\n\n2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:03.600\n no one wants to tell you you're crazy.\n\n2:01:03.600 --> 2:01:06.720\n No one wants to tell you your idea is bad.\n\n2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:08.120\n And you can, you're like, oh,\n\n2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:09.160\n oh, I'm going to be a leader.\n\n2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:12.280\n And the idea is, well, I'm just going to ask people.\n\n2:01:12.280 --> 2:01:13.600\n No one tells you.\n\n2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.560\n So like you have to look for the markers,\n\n2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:18.240\n knowing that literally just people\n\n2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:21.280\n aren't going to tell you along the way and be paranoid.\n\n2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:24.000\n I mean, you asked about selling the company.\n\n2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:25.960\n I think one of the biggest differences between me\n\n2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:28.240\n and a lot of other entrepreneurs is like,\n\n2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:30.440\n I wasn't completely confident we could do it.\n\n2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:35.440\n Like we could be alone and actually be great.\n\n2:01:35.920 --> 2:01:37.560\n And if any entrepreneur is honest with you,\n\n2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:39.120\n they also feel that way.\n\n2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:40.080\n But a lot of people are like,\n\n2:01:40.080 --> 2:01:42.600\n well, I have to be cocky and just say,\n\n2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:43.960\n I can do this on my own.\n\n2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:44.800\n We're going to be fine.\n\n2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:46.760\n We're going to crush everyone.\n\n2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.160\n Some people do say that and then it's not right.\n\n2:01:49.160 --> 2:01:50.760\n And they, and they fail.\n\n2:01:50.760 --> 2:01:55.480\n But being honest in that moment with yourself,\n\n2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.440\n with those close to you.\n\n2:01:57.440 --> 2:02:00.840\n And also you talked about the personality of leaders\n\n2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:02.940\n and who resonates and who doesn't.\n\n2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:09.320\n It's rare that I see leaders be vulnerable, rare.\n\n2:02:09.320 --> 2:02:12.500\n And one thing I tried to do at Instagram,\n\n2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:15.820\n at least internally was like, say when I screwed up\n\n2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:19.700\n and like point out how I was wrong about things\n\n2:02:19.700 --> 2:02:21.660\n and point out where my judgment was off.\n\n2:02:22.700 --> 2:02:25.360\n Everyone thinks they have to bat a thousand, right?\n\n2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:27.060\n Like that's crazy.\n\n2:02:27.060 --> 2:02:29.060\n The best quant hedge funds in the world,\n\n2:02:29.060 --> 2:02:31.660\n bat 50.001%.\n\n2:02:31.660 --> 2:02:34.020\n They just take a lot of bets, right?\n\n2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:37.800\n Renaissance, they might, they might bat 51%, right?\n\n2:02:37.800 --> 2:02:41.620\n But holy hell, like the question isn't,\n\n2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.340\n are you right every single time\n\n2:02:43.340 --> 2:02:45.040\n and you have to seem invincible.\n\n2:02:46.380 --> 2:02:48.220\n The question is how many at bats do you get?\n\n2:02:48.220 --> 2:02:53.220\n And on average, are you better on average, right?\n\n2:02:53.700 --> 2:02:55.620\n With enough bets and enough at bats\n\n2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:57.680\n that your aggregate can be very high.\n\n2:02:58.700 --> 2:03:01.980\n I mean, Steve Jobs was wrong at a lot of stuff.\n\n2:03:01.980 --> 2:03:03.780\n The Newton too early, right?\n\n2:03:03.780 --> 2:03:05.280\n Next, not quite right.\n\n2:03:05.280 --> 2:03:08.200\n There was even a time where he said like,\n\n2:03:08.200 --> 2:03:13.200\n no one will ever wanna watch a video on the iPod.\n\n2:03:13.340 --> 2:03:14.400\n Totally wrong.\n\n2:03:14.400 --> 2:03:16.200\n But who cares if you come around\n\n2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:18.600\n and realize your mistake and fix it.\n\n2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:20.360\n It becomes just like you said, harder and harder\n\n2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:23.000\n when your ego grows and the number of people around you\n\n2:03:23.000 --> 2:03:26.240\n that say positive things towards you grows.\n\n2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:28.560\n I actually think it's really valuable that,\n\n2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:31.560\n like let's imagine a counterfactual\n\n2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:34.760\n where Instagram became worth like $300 billion\n\n2:03:34.760 --> 2:03:36.120\n or something crazy, right?\n\n2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:40.240\n I kind of like that my life is relatively normal now.\n\n2:03:40.240 --> 2:03:41.840\n When I say relatively, you get what I mean.\n\n2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:44.260\n I'm not making a claim that I live a normal life,\n\n2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:46.180\n but like I certainly don't live in a world\n\n2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:49.460\n where there are like 15 Sherpas following me,\n\n2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:52.600\n like fetching me water, like that's not how it works.\n\n2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:56.540\n I actually like that I have a sense of humility of like,\n\n2:03:56.540 --> 2:03:59.160\n I may not found another thing that's nearly as big\n\n2:03:59.160 --> 2:04:01.140\n so I have to work twice as hard\n\n2:04:01.140 --> 2:04:04.420\n or I have to like learn twice as much.\n\n2:04:04.420 --> 2:04:07.320\n I have to, we haven't talked about machine learning yet,\n\n2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:11.260\n but my favorite thing is all these like famous,\n\n2:04:11.260 --> 2:04:14.980\n you know, tech guys who have worked in the industry,\n\n2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:17.280\n pontificating about the future of machine learning\n\n2:04:17.280 --> 2:04:19.080\n and how it's gonna kill us all, right?\n\n2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:22.340\n And like, I'm pretty sure they've never tried\n\n2:04:22.340 --> 2:04:24.400\n to build anything with machine learning themselves.\n\n2:04:24.400 --> 2:04:27.920\n Yes, so there's a nice line between people\n\n2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:29.640\n that actually build stuff with machine,\n\n2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:31.720\n like actually program something\n\n2:04:31.720 --> 2:04:33.720\n or at least understand some of those fundamentals\n\n2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:36.840\n and the people that are just saying philosophical stuff\n\n2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.460\n or journalists and so on.\n\n2:04:38.460 --> 2:04:40.840\n It's an interesting line to walk\n\n2:04:40.840 --> 2:04:44.900\n because the people who program are often not philosophers.\n\n2:04:44.900 --> 2:04:45.840\n Or don't have the attention,\n\n2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:48.080\n they can't write an op ed for the Wall Street Journal,\n\n2:04:48.080 --> 2:04:49.080\n like it doesn't work.\n\n2:04:49.080 --> 2:04:51.380\n So like, it's nice to be both a little bit,\n\n2:04:51.380 --> 2:04:52.880\n like to have elements of both.\n\n2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:56.220\n My point is the fact that I have to learn stuff from scratch\n\n2:04:56.220 --> 2:04:58.160\n or that I choose to are like.\n\n2:04:58.160 --> 2:04:59.760\n It's humbling.\n\n2:04:59.760 --> 2:05:02.960\n Yeah, I mean, again, I have a lot of advantages.\n\n2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:06.560\n I like, but my point is it's awesome\n\n2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:11.560\n to be back in a game where you have to fight.\n\n2:05:11.800 --> 2:05:13.180\n That is, that's fun.\n\n2:05:13.180 --> 2:05:15.240\n So being humble, being vulnerable,\n\n2:05:16.300 --> 2:05:18.040\n it's an important aspect of a leader\n\n2:05:18.040 --> 2:05:19.240\n and I hope it serves me well,\n\n2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:22.000\n but like, I can't fast forward 10 years to now.\n\n2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.040\n I've just, that's my game plan.\n\n2:05:24.040 --> 2:05:26.120\n Before I forget, I have to ask you one last thing\n\n2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:27.380\n on Instagram.\n\n2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:30.760\n What do you think about the whistleblower,\n\n2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:33.400\n Frances Haugen, recently coming out\n\n2:05:33.400 --> 2:05:36.360\n and saying that Facebook is aware of Instagram's\n\n2:05:36.360 --> 2:05:38.700\n harmful effect on teenage girls\n\n2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:43.320\n as per their own internal research studies on the matter?\n\n2:05:43.320 --> 2:05:46.040\n What do you think about this baby of yours,\n\n2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:48.240\n Instagram being under fire now,\n\n2:05:48.240 --> 2:05:52.080\n as we've been talking about under the leadership of Facebook?\n\n2:05:54.260 --> 2:05:59.260\n You know, I often question, where does the blame lie?\n\n2:05:59.260 --> 2:06:04.260\n Is the blame at the people that originated the network me?\n\n2:06:06.780 --> 2:06:10.540\n Is the blame at like the decision to combine the network\n\n2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:14.420\n with another network with a certain set of values?\n\n2:06:15.780 --> 2:06:20.500\n Is the blame at how it gets run after I left?\n\n2:06:20.500 --> 2:06:23.640\n Like, is it the driver or is it the car, right?\n\n2:06:25.820 --> 2:06:29.180\n Is it that someone enabled these devices in the first place?\n\n2:06:29.180 --> 2:06:31.780\n If you go to an extreme, right?\n\n2:06:31.780 --> 2:06:35.740\n Or is it the users themselves, just human nature?\n\n2:06:35.740 --> 2:06:37.740\n Is it just the way of human nature?\n\n2:06:37.740 --> 2:06:39.840\n Sure, and like the idea that we're gonna find\n\n2:06:39.840 --> 2:06:42.020\n a mutually exclusive answer here is crazy.\n\n2:06:42.020 --> 2:06:43.980\n There's not one place that's a combination\n\n2:06:43.980 --> 2:06:45.660\n of a lot of these things.\n\n2:06:45.660 --> 2:06:48.020\n And then the question is like, is it true at all, right?\n\n2:06:48.020 --> 2:06:50.820\n Like I'm not actually saying that's not true\n\n2:06:50.820 --> 2:06:55.520\n or that it's true, but there's always more nuance here.\n\n2:06:55.520 --> 2:06:59.260\n Do I believe that social media has an effect\n\n2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:00.260\n on young people?\n\n2:07:00.260 --> 2:07:02.380\n Well, it's got it, they use it a lot.\n\n2:07:02.380 --> 2:07:04.300\n And I bet you there are a lot of positive effects\n\n2:07:04.300 --> 2:07:05.740\n and I bet you there are negative effects,\n\n2:07:05.740 --> 2:07:07.620\n just like any technology.\n\n2:07:07.620 --> 2:07:10.180\n And where I've come to in my thinking on this\n\n2:07:10.180 --> 2:07:13.420\n is that I think any technology has negative side effects.\n\n2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:16.540\n The question is, as a leader, what do you do about them?\n\n2:07:16.540 --> 2:07:18.180\n And are you actively working on them\n\n2:07:18.180 --> 2:07:20.620\n or do you just like not really believe in them?\n\n2:07:20.620 --> 2:07:22.380\n If you're a leader that sits there and says,\n\n2:07:22.380 --> 2:07:24.060\n well, we're gonna put an enormous amount\n\n2:07:24.060 --> 2:07:26.280\n of resources against this.\n\n2:07:26.280 --> 2:07:29.580\n We're gonna acknowledge when there are true criticisms,\n\n2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:32.620\n we're gonna be vulnerable and that we're not perfect\n\n2:07:32.620 --> 2:07:33.700\n and we're gonna go fix them\n\n2:07:33.700 --> 2:07:36.200\n and we're gonna be held accountable along the way.\n\n2:07:37.220 --> 2:07:39.920\n I think that people generally really respect that.\n\n2:07:41.540 --> 2:07:44.340\n But I think that where Facebook I think has had issues\n\n2:07:44.340 --> 2:07:46.880\n in the past is where they say things like,\n\n2:07:46.880 --> 2:07:49.500\n can't remember what Mark said about misinformation\n\n2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:50.340\n during the election.\n\n2:07:50.340 --> 2:07:52.640\n There was that like famous quote where he was like,\n\n2:07:52.640 --> 2:07:54.780\n it's pretty crazy to think that Facebook had anything\n\n2:07:54.780 --> 2:07:55.660\n to do with this election.\n\n2:07:55.660 --> 2:07:57.140\n Like that was something like that quote.\n\n2:07:57.140 --> 2:08:00.340\n And I don't remember what stage he was on and yeah.\n\n2:08:00.340 --> 2:08:02.580\n But ooh, that did not age well, right?\n\n2:08:02.580 --> 2:08:05.660\n Like you have to be willing to say,\n\n2:08:05.660 --> 2:08:09.700\n well, maybe there's something there and wow,\n\n2:08:09.700 --> 2:08:11.060\n like I wanna go look into it\n\n2:08:11.060 --> 2:08:12.900\n and truly believe it in your gut.\n\n2:08:12.900 --> 2:08:14.580\n But if people look at you and how you act\n\n2:08:14.580 --> 2:08:18.680\n and what you say and don't believe you truly feel that way.\n\n2:08:18.680 --> 2:08:20.860\n It's not just the words you say, but how you say them\n\n2:08:20.860 --> 2:08:23.780\n and that people believe they actually feel the pain\n\n2:08:23.780 --> 2:08:25.380\n of having caused any suffering in the world.\n\n2:08:25.380 --> 2:08:29.320\n So to me, it's much more about your actions\n\n2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:31.540\n and your posture post event\n\n2:08:31.540 --> 2:08:33.060\n than it is about debugging the why.\n\n2:08:33.060 --> 2:08:36.780\n Cause I don't know, is it like, I don't know this research.\n\n2:08:36.780 --> 2:08:38.440\n It was written well after I left, right?\n\n2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:41.060\n Like, is it the algorithm?\n\n2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:42.360\n Is it the explore page?\n\n2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:45.460\n Is it the people you might know unit connecting you\n\n2:08:45.460 --> 2:08:47.860\n to ideas that are dangerous?\n\n2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:51.060\n Like I really don't know.\n\n2:08:51.060 --> 2:08:53.580\n So we'd have to have a much deeper,\n\n2:08:53.580 --> 2:08:56.580\n I think dive to understand where the blame lies.\n\n2:08:56.580 --> 2:08:58.700\n What's very unpleasant to me to consider,\n\n2:08:58.700 --> 2:09:00.060\n now, I don't know if this is true,\n\n2:09:00.060 --> 2:09:03.660\n but to consider the very fact that there might be\n\n2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:07.020\n some complicated games being played here.\n\n2:09:07.020 --> 2:09:10.780\n For example, as somebody, I really love psychology\n\n2:09:10.780 --> 2:09:13.540\n and I love it enough to know that the field\n\n2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:15.660\n is pretty broken in the following way.\n\n2:09:15.660 --> 2:09:19.980\n It's very difficult to study human beings well at scale\n\n2:09:19.980 --> 2:09:22.820\n because the questions you ask affect the results.\n\n2:09:22.820 --> 2:09:25.060\n You can basically get any results you want.\n\n2:09:25.060 --> 2:09:27.300\n And so you have an internal Facebook study\n\n2:09:27.300 --> 2:09:29.680\n that asks some question of which we don't know\n\n2:09:29.680 --> 2:09:32.580\n the full details and there's some kind of analysis,\n\n2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.820\n but that's just the one little tiny slice\n\n2:09:34.820 --> 2:09:37.060\n into some much bigger picture.\n\n2:09:37.060 --> 2:09:40.940\n And so you can have thousands of employees at Facebook.\n\n2:09:40.940 --> 2:09:44.360\n One of them comes out and picks whatever narrative,\n\n2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:46.460\n knowing that they become famous,\n\n2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:49.200\n coupled with the other really uncomfortable thing\n\n2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:53.280\n I see in the world, which is journalists seem to understand\n\n2:09:53.280 --> 2:09:55.840\n they get a lot of clickbait attention\n\n2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:58.420\n from saying something negative about social networks.\n\n2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:03.420\n Certain companies, like they even get some clickbait stuff\n\n2:10:03.780 --> 2:10:07.700\n about Tesla or about, especially when it's like,\n\n2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:11.060\n when there's a public famous CEO type of person,\n\n2:10:11.060 --> 2:10:14.500\n if they get a lot of views on the negative, not the positive,\n\n2:10:14.500 --> 2:10:16.380\n the positive, they'll get, I mean,\n\n2:10:16.380 --> 2:10:18.300\n it actually goes to the thing you were saying before,\n\n2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:20.780\n if there's a hot, sexy new product,\n\n2:10:20.780 --> 2:10:23.540\n that's great to look forward to, they get positive on that,\n\n2:10:23.540 --> 2:10:28.540\n but absent a product, it's nice to have like the CEO\n\n2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:30.260\n messing up in some kind of way.\n\n2:10:30.260 --> 2:10:33.580\n And so couple that with the whistleblower\n\n2:10:33.580 --> 2:10:38.300\n and with this whole dynamic of journalism and so on,\n\n2:10:38.300 --> 2:10:41.180\n you know, with Social Dilemma being really popular,\n\n2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:44.620\n documentary, it's like, all right,\n\n2:10:44.620 --> 2:10:48.800\n my concern is there's deep flaws in human nature here\n\n2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:51.300\n in terms of things we need to deal with,\n\n2:10:51.300 --> 2:10:54.420\n like the nature of hate, of bullying,\n\n2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:56.280\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:10:56.280 --> 2:10:59.060\n And then there's people who are trying to use that\n\n2:11:00.060 --> 2:11:02.420\n potentially to become famous and make money\n\n2:11:02.420 --> 2:11:06.980\n off of blaming others for causing more of the problem\n\n2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:08.860\n as opposed to helping solve the problem.\n\n2:11:08.860 --> 2:11:10.220\n So I don't know what to think.\n\n2:11:10.220 --> 2:11:12.900\n I'm not saying this is like, I'm just uncomfortable\n\n2:11:12.900 --> 2:11:16.740\n with, I guess, not knowing what to think about any of this\n\n2:11:16.740 --> 2:11:19.500\n because a bunch of folks I know that work at Facebook\n\n2:11:19.500 --> 2:11:21.500\n on the machine learning side, so Yann LeCun,\n\n2:11:21.500 --> 2:11:25.160\n I mean, they're quite upset about what's happening\n\n2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:26.860\n because there's a lot of really brilliant,\n\n2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:30.700\n good people inside Facebook that are trying to do good.\n\n2:11:30.700 --> 2:11:33.420\n And so like all of this press, Yann is one of them,\n\n2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:34.500\n and he has an amazing team\n\n2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:35.740\n with the machine learning researchers.\n\n2:11:35.740 --> 2:11:38.540\n Like he's really upset with the fact\n\n2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:40.540\n that people don't seem to understand\n\n2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:43.660\n that the portrayal does not represent\n\n2:11:43.660 --> 2:11:46.620\n the full nature of efforts that's going on at Facebook.\n\n2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:48.220\n So I don't know what to think about that.\n\n2:11:48.220 --> 2:11:52.700\n Well, you just, I think, very helpfully explained\n\n2:11:52.700 --> 2:11:54.060\n the nuance of the situation\n\n2:11:54.060 --> 2:11:56.300\n and why it's so hard to understand.\n\n2:11:56.300 --> 2:11:57.140\n But a couple of things.\n\n2:11:57.140 --> 2:12:02.140\n One is I think I have been surprised\n\n2:12:02.140 --> 2:12:07.140\n at the scale with which some product manager\n\n2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:14.380\n can do an enormous amount of harm\n\n2:12:14.380 --> 2:12:16.140\n to a very, very large company\n\n2:12:17.260 --> 2:12:19.260\n by releasing a trove of documents.\n\n2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:21.940\n Like I think I read a couple of them when they got published\n\n2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:24.140\n and I haven't even spent any time going deep.\n\n2:12:24.140 --> 2:12:26.040\n Part of it's like, I don't really feel like reliving\n\n2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.780\n a previous life, but wow.\n\n2:12:30.780 --> 2:12:34.420\n Like talk about challenging the idea of open culture\n\n2:12:34.420 --> 2:12:37.540\n and like what that does to Facebook internally.\n\n2:12:37.540 --> 2:12:42.060\n If Facebook was built, like I remember like my office,\n\n2:12:43.340 --> 2:12:45.700\n we had this like no visitors rule around my office\n\n2:12:45.700 --> 2:12:47.500\n because we always had like confidential stuff up\n\n2:12:47.500 --> 2:12:50.340\n on the walls and everyone was super angry\n\n2:12:50.340 --> 2:12:52.040\n because they're like, that goes against our culture\n\n2:12:52.040 --> 2:12:54.700\n of transparency and like marks in the fish cube\n\n2:12:54.700 --> 2:12:56.260\n or whatever they call it, the aquarium,\n\n2:12:56.260 --> 2:12:59.300\n I think they called it, where like literally anyone could see\n\n2:12:59.300 --> 2:13:03.300\n what he was doing at any point and I don't know.\n\n2:13:03.300 --> 2:13:06.540\n I mean, other companies like Apple have been quiet\n\n2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:10.240\n slash locked down, Snapchat's the same way for a reason.\n\n2:13:10.240 --> 2:13:14.260\n And I don't know what this does to transparency\n\n2:13:14.260 --> 2:13:16.820\n on the inside of startups that value that.\n\n2:13:16.820 --> 2:13:20.140\n I think that it's a seminal moment and you can say,\n\n2:13:20.140 --> 2:13:22.300\n well, you should have nothing to hide, right?\n\n2:13:22.300 --> 2:13:24.620\n But to your point, you can pick out documents\n\n2:13:24.620 --> 2:13:26.600\n that show anything, right?\n\n2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:28.500\n But I don't know.\n\n2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:31.380\n What happens to transparency inside of startups\n\n2:13:31.380 --> 2:13:35.440\n and the culture that startups or companies\n\n2:13:35.440 --> 2:13:37.980\n in the future will grow, like the startup of the future\n\n2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:40.420\n that becomes the next Facebook will be locked down\n\n2:13:40.420 --> 2:13:42.580\n and what does that do, right?\n\n2:13:42.580 --> 2:13:44.220\n So that's part one.\n\n2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:49.220\n Part two, like I don't think that you could design\n\n2:13:49.500 --> 2:13:54.500\n a more like a well orchestrated handful of events\n\n2:13:54.500 --> 2:13:59.500\n from the like 16 minutes to releasing the documents\n\n2:13:59.820 --> 2:14:02.420\n in the way that they were released at the right time.\n\n2:14:02.420 --> 2:14:05.580\n That takes a lot of planning and partnership.\n\n2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:09.060\n And it seems like she has a partner at some firm, right?\n\n2:14:09.060 --> 2:14:12.940\n That probably helped a lot with this, but man,\n\n2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:15.340\n at a personal level, if you're her,\n\n2:14:15.340 --> 2:14:19.860\n you'd have to really believe in what you are doing,\n\n2:14:19.860 --> 2:14:22.620\n really believe in it because you are personally\n\n2:14:22.620 --> 2:14:25.140\n putting your ass on the line, right?\n\n2:14:25.140 --> 2:14:29.020\n Like you've got a very large company\n\n2:14:29.020 --> 2:14:31.560\n that doesn't like enemies, right?\n\n2:14:33.700 --> 2:14:37.940\n It takes a lot of guts and I don't love\n\n2:14:37.940 --> 2:14:39.700\n these conspiracy theories about like,\n\n2:14:39.700 --> 2:14:42.380\n oh, she's being financed from some person or people.\n\n2:14:42.380 --> 2:14:43.700\n Like I don't love them because that's\n\n2:14:43.700 --> 2:14:45.680\n like the easy thing to say.\n\n2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:49.340\n I think the Occam's razor here is like someone thought\n\n2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:51.300\n they were doing something wrong\n\n2:14:51.300 --> 2:14:54.540\n and was like very, very courageous.\n\n2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:57.500\n And I don't know if courageous is the word,\n\n2:14:57.500 --> 2:15:00.540\n but like, so without getting into like,\n\n2:15:00.540 --> 2:15:01.800\n is she a martyr?\n\n2:15:01.800 --> 2:15:02.640\n Is she courageous?\n\n2:15:02.640 --> 2:15:03.480\n Is she right?\n\n2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:05.860\n Like, let's put that aside for a second.\n\n2:15:05.860 --> 2:15:07.460\n Then there are the documents themselves.\n\n2:15:07.460 --> 2:15:08.620\n They say what they say.\n\n2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:12.420\n To your point, a lot of the things that like people\n\n2:15:12.420 --> 2:15:15.060\n have been worried about already in the documents\n\n2:15:15.060 --> 2:15:17.260\n or they're already been said externally.\n\n2:15:17.260 --> 2:15:22.260\n And I don't know, I'm just like, I'm thankful\n\n2:15:22.340 --> 2:15:24.640\n that I am focused on new things with my life.\n\n2:15:25.820 --> 2:15:27.860\n Well, let me just say, I just think it's a really\n\n2:15:27.860 --> 2:15:30.860\n hard problem that probably Facebook and Twitter\n\n2:15:30.860 --> 2:15:32.280\n are trying to solve.\n\n2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:35.340\n I'm actually just fascinated by how hard this problem is.\n\n2:15:35.340 --> 2:15:38.380\n There are fundamental issues at Facebook in tone\n\n2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:41.740\n and in an approach of how product gets built\n\n2:15:41.740 --> 2:15:43.100\n and the objective functions.\n\n2:15:43.100 --> 2:15:48.100\n And since people, organizations are not people.\n\n2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:50.000\n So yawn and fair, right?\n\n2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:51.740\n Like there are a lot of really great people\n\n2:15:51.740 --> 2:15:53.380\n who like literally just want to push\n\n2:15:53.380 --> 2:15:55.220\n reinforcement learning forward.\n\n2:15:55.220 --> 2:15:56.940\n They literally just want to teach a robot\n\n2:15:56.940 --> 2:15:59.380\n to touch, feel, lift, right?\n\n2:15:59.380 --> 2:16:02.820\n Like they're not thinking about political misinformation,\n\n2:16:02.820 --> 2:16:03.880\n right?\n\n2:16:03.880 --> 2:16:07.440\n But there's a strong connection between what funds\n\n2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:10.740\n that research and an enormously profitable machine\n\n2:16:10.740 --> 2:16:13.360\n that has trade offs.\n\n2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:18.200\n And one cannot separate the two.\n\n2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:21.400\n You are not completely separate from the system.\n\n2:16:21.400 --> 2:16:24.520\n So I agree, it can feel really frustrating\n\n2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:27.220\n to feel if you're internal there,\n\n2:16:27.220 --> 2:16:29.600\n that you're working on something completely unrelated\n\n2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:31.200\n and you feel like your group's good.\n\n2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:32.840\n I can understand that.\n\n2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:34.440\n But there's some responsibility still.\n\n2:16:34.440 --> 2:16:36.440\n You have to acknowledge, it's like the Ray Dalio thing.\n\n2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:38.960\n You have to look in the mirror and see if there's problems\n\n2:16:38.960 --> 2:16:40.280\n and you have to fix those problems.\n\n2:16:40.280 --> 2:16:41.120\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:43.360 --> 2:16:46.720\n You mentioned machine learning reinforcement quite a bit.\n\n2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:50.200\n I mean, to me, social networks is one of the exciting places,\n\n2:16:50.200 --> 2:16:52.840\n recommender systems where machine learning is applied.\n\n2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:56.440\n Where else in the world, in the space of possibilities\n\n2:16:56.440 --> 2:16:58.200\n over the next five, 10, 20 years,\n\n2:16:58.200 --> 2:17:02.140\n do you think we're going to see impact of machine learning\n\n2:17:02.140 --> 2:17:05.000\n when you try, on the philosophical level,\n\n2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:07.280\n on a technical level, what do you think?\n\n2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:10.460\n Or within social networks themselves?\n\n2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:16.720\n Well, I think the obvious answers are climate change.\n\n2:17:17.120 --> 2:17:19.800\n Think about how much fuel\n\n2:17:19.800 --> 2:17:24.520\n or just waste there is in energy consumption today\n\n2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:27.460\n because we don't plan accordingly,\n\n2:17:27.460 --> 2:17:30.960\n because we take the least efficient route or...\n\n2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:32.640\n The logistics and stuff, the supply chain,\n\n2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:33.480\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:36.600\n Yeah, I mean, listen, if we're gonna fight climate change,\n\n2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:39.920\n like one really way, one awesome way to do it\n\n2:17:39.920 --> 2:17:43.280\n is figure out how to optimize how we operate as a species\n\n2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:47.220\n and minimize the amount of energy we consume\n\n2:17:47.220 --> 2:17:51.080\n to maximize whatever economic impact we wanna have.\n\n2:17:51.080 --> 2:17:53.900\n Because right now those two are very much tied together.\n\n2:17:53.900 --> 2:17:56.520\n And I don't believe that that has to be the case.\n\n2:17:56.520 --> 2:17:59.020\n There's this really interesting, you've read it.\n\n2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:00.840\n For people who are listening,\n\n2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:02.680\n there's this really interesting paper\n\n2:18:02.680 --> 2:18:04.000\n on reinforcement learning\n\n2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:06.200\n and energy consumption inside buildings.\n\n2:18:06.200 --> 2:18:08.280\n It's like one of the seminal ones, right?\n\n2:18:08.280 --> 2:18:10.280\n But imagine that at massive scale.\n\n2:18:10.280 --> 2:18:11.280\n That's super interesting.\n\n2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:15.300\n I mean, they've done resource planning for servers\n\n2:18:15.300 --> 2:18:17.800\n for peak load using reinforcement learning.\n\n2:18:17.800 --> 2:18:19.560\n I don't know if that was at Google or somewhere else,\n\n2:18:19.560 --> 2:18:21.880\n but like, okay, great, you do it for servers,\n\n2:18:21.880 --> 2:18:24.040\n but what if you could do it for just capacity\n\n2:18:24.040 --> 2:18:26.200\n and general energy capacity for cities\n\n2:18:26.200 --> 2:18:27.520\n and planning for traffic?\n\n2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:30.960\n And of course there's all the self driving cars\n\n2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:34.060\n and I don't know, like I'm not gonna pontificate\n\n2:18:34.060 --> 2:18:39.060\n on like crazy ideas using reinforcement learning\n\n2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:40.160\n or machine learning.\n\n2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:41.240\n It's just so clear to me\n\n2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:43.640\n that humans don't think quickly enough.\n\n2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:46.520\n So it's interesting to think about machine learning\n\n2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:49.680\n helping a little bit at scale.\n\n2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:52.000\n So a little bit to a large number of people\n\n2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:53.460\n that has a huge impact.\n\n2:18:53.460 --> 2:18:57.320\n So if you optimize, say Google Maps, something like that,\n\n2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:00.120\n trajectory planning or what a map quest first.\n\n2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:02.960\n Getting here, I looked and it was like,\n\n2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:04.520\n here's the most energy efficient route.\n\n2:19:04.520 --> 2:19:05.680\n And I was like, I'm gonna be late.\n\n2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:07.280\n I need to take the fastest route.\n\n2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:09.160\n As opposed to unrolling the map.\n\n2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:10.640\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:12.960\n Like, and then that's going to be very inefficient\n\n2:19:12.960 --> 2:19:13.800\n no matter what.\n\n2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:14.800\n I was definitely the other day,\n\n2:19:14.800 --> 2:19:17.820\n like part of the Epsilon of Epsilon Greedy\n\n2:19:17.820 --> 2:19:21.800\n with Waze where like I was sent on like a weird route\n\n2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:22.960\n that I could tell they're like,\n\n2:19:22.960 --> 2:19:24.960\n we just need to collect data at this road.\n\n2:19:24.960 --> 2:19:26.920\n Like we just, Kevin's.\n\n2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:28.760\n You were the ant they sent out for exploration.\n\n2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:30.400\n Kevin's definitely gonna be the guinea pig.\n\n2:19:30.400 --> 2:19:32.120\n And great, now we have.\n\n2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:34.160\n Did you at least feel pride?\n\n2:19:34.160 --> 2:19:36.000\n Oh, going through it, I was like, oh, this is fun.\n\n2:19:36.000 --> 2:19:38.280\n Like now they get data about this weird shortcut.\n\n2:19:38.280 --> 2:19:40.180\n And actually I hit all the green lights networked.\n\n2:19:40.180 --> 2:19:41.880\n I'm like, this is a problem.\n\n2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:42.720\n Bad data.\n\n2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:44.680\n Bad data, they're just gonna imagine.\n\n2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:47.520\n I could see you slowing down and stopping at a green light\n\n2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:50.080\n just to give them the right kind of data.\n\n2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:51.000\n But to answer your question,\n\n2:19:51.000 --> 2:19:53.400\n like I feel like that was fairly unsatisfying\n\n2:19:53.400 --> 2:19:55.000\n and it's easy to say climate change.\n\n2:19:55.000 --> 2:19:58.640\n But what I would say is at Instagram,\n\n2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:02.120\n everything we applied machine learning to\n\n2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:04.800\n got better for users and it got better for the company.\n\n2:20:04.800 --> 2:20:06.200\n I saw the power.\n\n2:20:06.200 --> 2:20:08.200\n I didn't fully understand it as an executive.\n\n2:20:08.200 --> 2:20:10.640\n And I think that's actually one of the issues\n\n2:20:10.640 --> 2:20:12.860\n that, and when I say understand,\n\n2:20:12.860 --> 2:20:14.020\n I mean the mathematics of it.\n\n2:20:14.020 --> 2:20:15.320\n Like I understand what it does.\n\n2:20:15.320 --> 2:20:17.040\n I understand that it helps.\n\n2:20:17.040 --> 2:20:20.120\n But there are a lot of executives now\n\n2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:22.080\n that talk about it in the way\n\n2:20:22.080 --> 2:20:23.680\n that they talk about the internet\n\n2:20:23.680 --> 2:20:25.560\n or they talked about the internet like 10 years ago.\n\n2:20:25.560 --> 2:20:27.040\n They're like, we're gonna build mobile.\n\n2:20:27.040 --> 2:20:27.940\n And you're like, what does that mean?\n\n2:20:27.940 --> 2:20:29.400\n They're like, we're just gonna do mobile.\n\n2:20:29.400 --> 2:20:31.220\n And you're like, okay.\n\n2:20:31.220 --> 2:20:33.900\n So my sense is the next generation of leaders\n\n2:20:33.900 --> 2:20:37.160\n will have grown up having had classes\n\n2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:40.160\n in reinforcement learning, supervised learning, whatever.\n\n2:20:40.160 --> 2:20:42.880\n And they will be able to thoughtfully apply it\n\n2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:46.280\n to their companies and the places that it is needed most.\n\n2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:47.660\n And that's really cool.\n\n2:20:47.660 --> 2:20:50.000\n Cause I mean, talk about efficiency gains.\n\n2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:54.760\n That's what excites me the most about it.\n\n2:20:54.760 --> 2:20:58.080\n Yeah, so there's, it's interesting just to get a fundamental\n\n2:20:58.080 --> 2:20:59.440\n first principles understanding\n\n2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:01.000\n of certain concepts of machine learning.\n\n2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:04.400\n So supervised learning from an executive perspective,\n\n2:21:04.400 --> 2:21:07.020\n supervised learning, you have to have a lot of humans\n\n2:21:07.020 --> 2:21:08.440\n label a lot of data.\n\n2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:09.960\n So the question there is, okay,\n\n2:21:09.960 --> 2:21:12.380\n can we gather a large amount of data\n\n2:21:12.380 --> 2:21:14.360\n that can be labeled well?\n\n2:21:14.360 --> 2:21:16.080\n And that's the question Tesla asked,\n\n2:21:16.080 --> 2:21:17.760\n like can we create a data engine\n\n2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:22.040\n that keeps sending an imperfect machine learning system\n\n2:21:22.040 --> 2:21:25.000\n out there, whenever it fails, it gives us data back.\n\n2:21:25.000 --> 2:21:27.640\n We label it by human and we send it back and forth\n\n2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:28.640\n to this way.\n\n2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:30.440\n Then there's Yann LeCun's excited\n\n2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:32.380\n about the self supervised learning\n\n2:21:32.380 --> 2:21:36.140\n where you do much less human labeling\n\n2:21:36.140 --> 2:21:38.880\n and there's some kind of mechanism for the system\n\n2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:42.760\n to learn it by itself on the human generated data.\n\n2:21:42.760 --> 2:21:44.760\n And then there's the reinforcement learning,\n\n2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:47.800\n which is like basically allowing,\n\n2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:52.080\n it's applying the alpha zero technology\n\n2:21:52.080 --> 2:21:56.080\n that allow through self play to learn how to solve\n\n2:21:56.080 --> 2:21:59.920\n the game of Go and achieve incredible levels\n\n2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:01.140\n at the game of chess.\n\n2:22:02.580 --> 2:22:05.160\n Can you formulate the problem you're trying to solve\n\n2:22:05.160 --> 2:22:07.600\n in a way that's amenable to reinforcement learning?\n\n2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:09.960\n And can you get the right kind of signal at scale?\n\n2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:11.840\n Cause you need a lot of signal.\n\n2:22:11.840 --> 2:22:15.480\n And that's kind of fascinating to see which part\n\n2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:17.640\n of a social network can you convert\n\n2:22:17.640 --> 2:22:19.440\n into reinforcement learning problem.\n\n2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:22.280\n The fascinating thing about reinforcement learning,\n\n2:22:22.280 --> 2:22:25.960\n I think, is that we now have learned\n\n2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:30.960\n to apply neural networks to guess the Q function,\n\n2:22:34.260 --> 2:22:37.920\n basically the values for any state in action.\n\n2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:40.480\n And that is fascinating cause we used to just like,\n\n2:22:40.480 --> 2:22:42.160\n I don't know, have like a linear regression,\n\n2:22:42.160 --> 2:22:45.320\n like hope it worked and that was the fanciest version of it.\n\n2:22:45.320 --> 2:22:47.400\n But now you look at it, I'm like trying to learn this stuff\n\n2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:48.440\n and I look at it and I'm like,\n\n2:22:48.440 --> 2:22:51.640\n there are like 17 different acronyms of different ways\n\n2:22:51.640 --> 2:22:52.760\n you can try to apply this.\n\n2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:56.080\n No one quite agrees, like what's the best.\n\n2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:58.880\n Generally, if you're trying to like build a neural network,\n\n2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:02.120\n there are pretty well trodden ways of doing that.\n\n2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:04.520\n You use Adam, you use ReLU,\n\n2:23:04.520 --> 2:23:07.360\n like there's just like general good ideas.\n\n2:23:07.360 --> 2:23:08.840\n And in reinforcement learning,\n\n2:23:08.840 --> 2:23:12.640\n I feel like the consensus is like, it totally depends.\n\n2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:16.440\n And by the way, it's really hard to get it to converge\n\n2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:18.640\n and it's noisy and it like,\n\n2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:20.640\n so there are all these really interesting ideas\n\n2:23:20.640 --> 2:23:22.260\n around building simulators.\n\n2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:25.700\n You know, like for instance, in self driving, right?\n\n2:23:25.700 --> 2:23:29.300\n Like you don't want to like actually have someone\n\n2:23:29.300 --> 2:23:31.880\n getting in an accident to learn that an accident is bad.\n\n2:23:31.880 --> 2:23:33.920\n So you start simulating accidents,\n\n2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:35.440\n simulating aggressive drivers,\n\n2:23:35.440 --> 2:23:38.080\n just simulating crazy dogs that run into the street and,\n\n2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:41.280\n wow, fascinating, right?\n\n2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:43.600\n Like my mind starts racing and then the question is,\n\n2:23:43.600 --> 2:23:45.920\n okay, forget about self driving cars.\n\n2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:48.480\n Let's talk about social networks.\n\n2:23:49.780 --> 2:23:52.960\n How can you produce a better, more thoughtful experience\n\n2:23:52.960 --> 2:23:55.840\n using these types of algorithms?\n\n2:23:55.840 --> 2:23:58.200\n And honestly, in talking to some of the people\n\n2:23:58.200 --> 2:24:01.640\n that work at Facebook and old Instagrammers,\n\n2:24:01.640 --> 2:24:04.160\n most people are like, yeah, we tried a lot of things,\n\n2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:05.600\n didn't quite ever make it work.\n\n2:24:05.600 --> 2:24:06.720\n I mean, for the longest time,\n\n2:24:06.720 --> 2:24:10.600\n Facebook ads was effectively a logistic regression, okay?\n\n2:24:10.600 --> 2:24:11.740\n I don't know what it is now,\n\n2:24:11.740 --> 2:24:13.160\n but like if you look at this paper\n\n2:24:13.160 --> 2:24:14.080\n that they published back in the day,\n\n2:24:14.080 --> 2:24:16.120\n it was literally just a logistic regression.\n\n2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:17.120\n Made a lot of money.\n\n2:24:18.960 --> 2:24:21.760\n So even at these like extremely large scales,\n\n2:24:21.760 --> 2:24:23.320\n if we are not yet touching\n\n2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:25.520\n what reinforcement learning can truly do,\n\n2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:27.400\n imagine what the next 10 years looks like.\n\n2:24:27.400 --> 2:24:28.600\n How cool is that?\n\n2:24:28.600 --> 2:24:29.620\n It's amazing.\n\n2:24:29.620 --> 2:24:32.200\n So I really liked the use of reinforcement learning\n\n2:24:32.200 --> 2:24:34.760\n as part of the simulation, for example,\n\n2:24:34.760 --> 2:24:37.760\n like with self driving cars, it's modeling pedestrians.\n\n2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:40.440\n So the nice thing about reinforcement learning,\n\n2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:45.040\n it can be used to learn agents within the world.\n\n2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:47.080\n So they can learn to behave properly.\n\n2:24:47.080 --> 2:24:49.360\n Like you can teach pedestrians to,\n\n2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:51.640\n like you don't hard code the way they behave,\n\n2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:53.280\n they learn how to behave.\n\n2:24:53.280 --> 2:24:55.200\n In that same way, I do have a hope,\n\n2:24:55.200 --> 2:24:58.280\n was it Jack Dorsey talks about healthy conversations.\n\n2:24:58.280 --> 2:25:01.640\n You talked about meaningful interactions, I believe.\n\n2:25:03.520 --> 2:25:06.940\n Like simulating interactions.\n\n2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:09.480\n So you can learn how to manage that, it's fascinating.\n\n2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:13.040\n So where most of your algorithm development happens\n\n2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:16.480\n in virtual worlds, and then you can really learn\n\n2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:18.120\n how to design the interface,\n\n2:25:18.120 --> 2:25:21.400\n how you design a bunch of aspects of the experience\n\n2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:24.480\n in terms of how you select what's shown in the feed,\n\n2:25:24.480 --> 2:25:26.120\n all those kinds of things.\n\n2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:28.480\n It feels like if you can connect reinforcement learning\n\n2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:30.080\n to that, that's super exciting.\n\n2:25:30.080 --> 2:25:35.080\n Yep, and I think if you have a company and leadership\n\n2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:36.560\n that believe in doing the right things\n\n2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:38.920\n and can apply this technology in the right way,\n\n2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:41.440\n some really special stuff can happen.\n\n2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:44.440\n It is mostly likely going to be a group of people\n\n2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:47.960\n we've never heard about, start up from scratch, right?\n\n2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:52.920\n And you asked if like new social networks could be built,\n\n2:25:52.920 --> 2:25:54.300\n I've got to imagine they will be.\n\n2:25:54.300 --> 2:25:58.400\n And whoever starts it, it might be some kids in a garage\n\n2:25:58.400 --> 2:26:02.200\n that took these classes from these people, you, right?\n\n2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:04.400\n And they're building all of these things\n\n2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:06.320\n with this tech at the core.\n\n2:26:06.320 --> 2:26:08.400\n So I'm trying not to be someone who just like throws\n\n2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:11.880\n around reinforcement learning as a buzzword.\n\n2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:16.240\n I truly believe that it is the most cutting edge\n\n2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:18.320\n in what can happen in social networks.\n\n2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:20.880\n And I also believe it's super hard.\n\n2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:22.480\n Like it's super hard to make it work.\n\n2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:24.040\n It's super hard to do it at scale.\n\n2:26:24.040 --> 2:26:26.840\n It's super hard to find people that truly understand it.\n\n2:26:26.840 --> 2:26:28.600\n So I'm not gonna say that like,\n\n2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:31.760\n I think it'll be applied in social networks\n\n2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:33.840\n before we have true self driving.\n\n2:26:33.840 --> 2:26:36.920\n Yeah, we could argue about this for a long time,\n\n2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:38.000\n but yes, I agree with you.\n\n2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.480\n I think self driving is way harder than people realize.\n\n2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:41.840\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:44.040\n Let me ask you in terms of that kid in the garage\n\n2:26:44.040 --> 2:26:45.520\n or those couple of kids in the garage,\n\n2:26:45.520 --> 2:26:47.040\n what advice would you give to them\n\n2:26:47.040 --> 2:26:50.760\n if they wanna start a new social network or a business?\n\n2:26:50.760 --> 2:26:52.280\n What advice would you give to somebody\n\n2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:54.700\n with a big dream and a young startup?\n\n2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:59.500\n To me, you have to choose to do something\n\n2:26:59.500 --> 2:27:03.800\n that even if it fails, like it was so fun, right?\n\n2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:06.680\n Like we never started Instagram knowing\n\n2:27:06.680 --> 2:27:07.760\n it was going to be big.\n\n2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:10.480\n We started Instagram because we loved photography.\n\n2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:12.480\n We loved social networks.\n\n2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:14.520\n I had seen what other social networks had done\n\n2:27:14.520 --> 2:27:17.640\n and I thought, hmm, maybe we did a spin on this,\n\n2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:20.400\n but like nowhere was our feet predestined.\n\n2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:23.640\n Like it wasn't like, it wasn't written out anywhere\n\n2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:25.640\n that everything was gonna go great.\n\n2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:27.000\n And I often think the counterfactual,\n\n2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:28.820\n like what if it had not gone well?\n\n2:27:28.820 --> 2:27:30.360\n I would have been like, I don't know, that was fun.\n\n2:27:30.360 --> 2:27:32.280\n We raised some money, we learned some stuff\n\n2:27:32.280 --> 2:27:37.280\n and does it position you well for the next experience?\n\n2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:39.240\n That's the advice that I would give\n\n2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:41.200\n to anyone wanting to start something today,\n\n2:27:41.200 --> 2:27:45.120\n which is like, does this meet with your ultimate goals?\n\n2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:47.200\n Not wealth, not fame, none of that,\n\n2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:48.840\n because all of that, by the way, is bullshit.\n\n2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:52.360\n Like you can get super famous and super wealthy.\n\n2:27:52.360 --> 2:27:55.960\n And I think generally those are not things that,\n\n2:27:57.400 --> 2:27:59.420\n again, it's easy to say with like a lot of money\n\n2:27:59.420 --> 2:28:01.800\n that somehow like it's not good to have a lot of money.\n\n2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:04.920\n It's just, I think that complicates life enormously\n\n2:28:04.920 --> 2:28:06.900\n in a way that people don't fully comprehend.\n\n2:28:06.900 --> 2:28:09.520\n So I think it is way more interesting to shoot for,\n\n2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:11.760\n can I make something that people love,\n\n2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:13.600\n that provides value in the world,\n\n2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:17.520\n that I love building, that I love working on, right?\n\n2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:21.920\n That's what I would do if I were starting from scratch.\n\n2:28:21.920 --> 2:28:22.960\n And by the way, like in some ways\n\n2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:25.200\n that I will do that personally,\n\n2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:26.420\n which is like choose the thing\n\n2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:27.920\n that you get up every morning and you're like,\n\n2:28:27.920 --> 2:28:32.920\n I love this, even when it's painful.\n\n2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:34.480\n Even when it's painful.\n\n2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:36.780\n What about a social network specifically?\n\n2:28:36.780 --> 2:28:40.600\n If you were to imagine, put yourself in the mind of some.\n\n2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:42.000\n I can't compete against myself.\n\n2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:43.600\n I can't give out ideas.\n\n2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:44.440\n Okay, I got you.\n\n2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:45.840\n No, but it's like high level.\n\n2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:47.600\n You can focus on community.\n\n2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:48.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:53.320\n I said that as a half joke.\n\n2:28:54.160 --> 2:28:56.960\n In all honesty, I think these things are so hard to build\n\n2:28:56.960 --> 2:28:59.960\n that like ideas are a dime a dozen, but.\n\n2:28:59.960 --> 2:29:02.920\n You have talked about keeping it simple.\n\n2:29:02.920 --> 2:29:03.760\n Can I tell you?\n\n2:29:03.760 --> 2:29:04.920\n Which is a liberating idea.\n\n2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:08.280\n My model is it's three circles and they overlap.\n\n2:29:08.280 --> 2:29:11.360\n One circle is what do I have experience at?\n\n2:29:11.360 --> 2:29:12.800\n Slash, what am I good at?\n\n2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:14.140\n I don't like saying what am I good at\n\n2:29:14.140 --> 2:29:16.040\n because it just like seems like,\n\n2:29:16.040 --> 2:29:18.280\n what do I have experience in, right?\n\n2:29:18.280 --> 2:29:19.720\n What can I bring to the table?\n\n2:29:19.720 --> 2:29:22.040\n What am I excited about is the other circle.\n\n2:29:22.040 --> 2:29:22.880\n What gets it?\n\n2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:24.640\n What's just super cool, right?\n\n2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:27.240\n That I want to work on because even when this is hard,\n\n2:29:29.160 --> 2:29:30.000\n I think it's so cool.\n\n2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:31.720\n I want to stick with it.\n\n2:29:31.720 --> 2:29:34.960\n And the last circle is like, what does the world need?\n\n2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:36.200\n And if that circle ain't there,\n\n2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:37.720\n it doesn't matter what you work on.\n\n2:29:37.720 --> 2:29:39.280\n Cause there are a lot of startups that exist\n\n2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:43.200\n that just no one needs or very small markets need.\n\n2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:44.840\n But if you want to be successful,\n\n2:29:44.840 --> 2:29:47.240\n I think if you're like, if you're good at it,\n\n2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:49.720\n you have, sorry, if you're good at it,\n\n2:29:49.720 --> 2:29:51.640\n you're passionate about it and the world needs it.\n\n2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:53.040\n I mean, this sounds simple,\n\n2:29:53.040 --> 2:29:54.920\n not enough people sit down and just think\n\n2:29:54.920 --> 2:29:58.120\n about those circles and think, do these things overlap?\n\n2:29:58.120 --> 2:29:59.480\n And then can I get that middle section?\n\n2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:01.720\n It's small, but can I get that middle section?\n\n2:30:02.840 --> 2:30:04.640\n I think a lot about that personally.\n\n2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:09.040\n And then you have to be really honest about the circle\n\n2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:14.040\n that you're good at and really honest about the circle\n\n2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:17.080\n that the world needs.\n\n2:30:17.080 --> 2:30:20.280\n And as opposed to really honest about the passion,\n\n2:30:20.280 --> 2:30:22.520\n like what do you actually love?\n\n2:30:22.520 --> 2:30:24.600\n As opposed to like some kind of dream of making money,\n\n2:30:24.600 --> 2:30:26.600\n all those kinds of stuff, like literally love doing.\n\n2:30:26.600 --> 2:30:29.960\n I had a former engineer who decided to start a startup\n\n2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:32.080\n and I was like, are you sure you want to start a company\n\n2:30:32.080 --> 2:30:34.440\n versus like join something else?\n\n2:30:34.440 --> 2:30:39.440\n Because being a coach of an NBA team and playing basketball\n\n2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:41.440\n are two very, very different things.\n\n2:30:42.320 --> 2:30:45.880\n And like not everyone fully understands the difference.\n\n2:30:45.880 --> 2:30:47.680\n I think you can kind of do it both.\n\n2:30:50.160 --> 2:30:51.960\n And I don't know, jury's out on that one\n\n2:30:51.960 --> 2:30:54.600\n because like they're in the middle of it now.\n\n2:30:54.600 --> 2:30:57.640\n But it's really important to figure out\n\n2:30:57.640 --> 2:30:59.880\n what you're good at, not be full of yourself,\n\n2:30:59.880 --> 2:31:02.080\n like truly look at your track record.\n\n2:31:03.720 --> 2:31:07.400\n What's the saying like, it ain't bragging if you can do it.\n\n2:31:09.200 --> 2:31:12.280\n But too many people are delusional\n\n2:31:12.280 --> 2:31:14.280\n and like think they're better at things\n\n2:31:14.280 --> 2:31:15.480\n than they actually are,\n\n2:31:15.480 --> 2:31:18.640\n or think there's a bigger market than there actually is.\n\n2:31:18.640 --> 2:31:21.080\n When you confuse your passion for things with a big market,\n\n2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:23.600\n that's really scary, right?\n\n2:31:23.600 --> 2:31:25.000\n Like just because you think it's cool\n\n2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:27.120\n doesn't mean that it's a big business opportunity.\n\n2:31:27.120 --> 2:31:28.760\n So like, what evidence do you have?\n\n2:31:28.760 --> 2:31:32.600\n Again, I'm a fairly like, I'm a strict rationalist on this.\n\n2:31:32.600 --> 2:31:35.000\n And like sometimes people don't like working with me\n\n2:31:35.000 --> 2:31:37.160\n because I'm pretty pragmatic about things.\n\n2:31:37.160 --> 2:31:40.440\n Like I'm not Elon, like I don't sit\n\n2:31:40.440 --> 2:31:44.160\n and make bold proclamations about visiting Mars.\n\n2:31:44.160 --> 2:31:46.160\n Like that's just not how I work.\n\n2:31:46.160 --> 2:31:48.480\n I'm like, okay, I want to build this really cool thing\n\n2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:50.840\n that's fairly practical and I think we could do it.\n\n2:31:50.840 --> 2:31:52.320\n And it's in this way.\n\n2:31:52.320 --> 2:31:55.040\n And what's cool though is like, that's just my sweet spot.\n\n2:31:55.040 --> 2:31:58.760\n I'm not like, I just, I can't with a straight face\n\n2:31:58.760 --> 2:31:59.680\n talk about the metaphors.\n\n2:31:59.680 --> 2:32:01.960\n I can't, I just, it's not me.\n\n2:32:01.960 --> 2:32:05.400\n What do you think about the Facebook renaming itself to?\n\n2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:06.440\n I didn't mean that as a dig.\n\n2:32:06.440 --> 2:32:09.440\n I just literally mean like, I'm fairly,\n\n2:32:09.440 --> 2:32:11.200\n I like to live in the next five years.\n\n2:32:11.200 --> 2:32:13.520\n And like, what things can I get out in a year\n\n2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:15.040\n that people will use at scale?\n\n2:32:15.040 --> 2:32:20.040\n And so it's just, again, those circles I think are different\n\n2:32:20.360 --> 2:32:22.200\n for different people, but it's important to realize\n\n2:32:22.200 --> 2:32:26.040\n that like market matters, you being good at it matters\n\n2:32:26.040 --> 2:32:27.960\n and having passion for it matters.\n\n2:32:27.960 --> 2:32:29.440\n Your question, sorry.\n\n2:32:29.440 --> 2:32:33.760\n Well, on that last, on this topic in terms of funding,\n\n2:32:33.760 --> 2:32:36.480\n is there, by way of advice,\n\n2:32:39.200 --> 2:32:44.200\n was funding in your own journey helpful, unhelpful?\n\n2:32:44.840 --> 2:32:48.360\n Like is there a right time to get funding, venture funding\n\n2:32:48.360 --> 2:32:51.120\n or anything, borrow some money from your parents?\n\n2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:51.960\n I don't know.\n\n2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:54.880\n Like is money getting in the way?\n\n2:32:54.880 --> 2:32:56.040\n Does it help?\n\n2:32:56.040 --> 2:32:57.440\n Is the timing important?\n\n2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:00.280\n Is there some kind of wisdom you can give there\n\n2:33:00.280 --> 2:33:02.960\n because you were exceptionally successful very quickly?\n\n2:33:06.480 --> 2:33:09.720\n Funding helps as long as it's from the right people.\n\n2:33:09.720 --> 2:33:10.640\n That includes yourself.\n\n2:33:10.640 --> 2:33:13.640\n And I'll talk about myself funding myself in a second,\n\n2:33:13.640 --> 2:33:15.800\n which is like, because I can fund myself\n\n2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:18.000\n doing whatever projects I can do,\n\n2:33:18.000 --> 2:33:20.600\n I don't really have another person putting pressure on me\n\n2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:24.440\n except for myself and that creates strange dynamics, right?\n\n2:33:24.440 --> 2:33:27.080\n But let's like talk about people getting funding\n\n2:33:27.080 --> 2:33:28.960\n from a venture capitalist initially.\n\n2:33:30.440 --> 2:33:32.480\n We raised money from Matt Kohler at Benchmark.\n\n2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:36.480\n He's brilliant, amazing guy, very thoughtful.\n\n2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:39.440\n And he was very helpful early on.\n\n2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:41.080\n But I have stories from entrepreneurs\n\n2:33:41.080 --> 2:33:42.880\n where they raised money from the wrong person\n\n2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:45.920\n or the wrong firm where incentives weren't aligned.\n\n2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:48.600\n They didn't think in the same way\n\n2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:51.320\n and bad things happened because of that.\n\n2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:53.480\n The boardroom was always noisy.\n\n2:33:53.480 --> 2:33:55.520\n There were fights, like we just never had that.\n\n2:33:55.520 --> 2:33:57.080\n Matt was great.\n\n2:33:57.080 --> 2:33:59.880\n I think like capital these days\n\n2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:01.720\n is kind of a dime a dozen, right?\n\n2:34:01.720 --> 2:34:03.120\n Like as long as you're fundable,\n\n2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:05.080\n like it seems like there's money out there\n\n2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:06.520\n is what I'm hearing.\n\n2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:10.400\n It's really important that you are aligned\n\n2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:12.000\n and that you think of raising money\n\n2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:15.000\n as hiring someone for your team rather than taking money\n\n2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:18.320\n if capital is plentiful, right?\n\n2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:20.880\n It provides a certain amount of pressure\n\n2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:23.080\n to do the right thing that I think is healthy\n\n2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:24.120\n for any startup.\n\n2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:25.720\n And it keeps you real and honest\n\n2:34:25.720 --> 2:34:27.400\n because they don't wanna lose their money.\n\n2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:29.640\n They're paid to not lose their money.\n\n2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:32.720\n The problem, maybe I could depersonalize it,\n\n2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:35.800\n but like I remember having lunch with Elon.\n\n2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:37.640\n It's only happened once.\n\n2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:39.960\n And I asked him, like I was trying to figure out\n\n2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:42.560\n what I was doing after Instagram, right?\n\n2:34:42.560 --> 2:34:44.880\n And I asked him something about like angel investing.\n\n2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:46.320\n And he looked at me with a straight face.\n\n2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:48.120\n He was like, why the F would I do that?\n\n2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:48.960\n Like, why?\n\n2:34:48.960 --> 2:34:50.760\n I was like, I don't know.\n\n2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:51.600\n Like you're connected.\n\n2:34:51.600 --> 2:34:54.760\n Like seems like he's like, I only invest in myself.\n\n2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:56.880\n I was like, Ooh, okay.\n\n2:34:56.880 --> 2:34:59.240\n You know, like not the confidence.\n\n2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:00.880\n I was just like, what a novel idea.\n\n2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:03.080\n It's like, yeah, if you have money,\n\n2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:06.000\n like why not just put it against your bag\n\n2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:11.000\n and like enable you're visiting Mars or something, right?\n\n2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:12.800\n Like that's awesome, great.\n\n2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:14.920\n But I had never really thought of it that way.\n\n2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:17.600\n But also with that comes an interesting dynamic\n\n2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:22.200\n where you don't actually have people\n\n2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:23.920\n who are gonna lose that money telling you,\n\n2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:27.000\n hey, don't do this or, hey, you need to face this reality.\n\n2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:31.000\n So you need to create other versions of that truth teller.\n\n2:35:32.560 --> 2:35:34.560\n And whatever I do next,\n\n2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:36.720\n that's gonna be one of the interesting challenges\n\n2:35:36.720 --> 2:35:40.640\n is how do you create that truth telling situation?\n\n2:35:40.640 --> 2:35:41.720\n And that's part of why, by the way,\n\n2:35:41.720 --> 2:35:43.800\n I think someone like Jack, when you start Square,\n\n2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:46.800\n you have money, but you still, you bring on partners\n\n2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:48.680\n because I think it creates\n\n2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.400\n a truth telling type environment.\n\n2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:52.440\n I'm still trying to figure this out.\n\n2:35:52.440 --> 2:35:56.440\n Like it's an interesting dynamic.\n\n2:35:56.440 --> 2:35:59.840\n So you're thinking of perhaps launching some kind of venture\n\n2:35:59.840 --> 2:36:01.720\n where you're investing in yourself?\n\n2:36:01.720 --> 2:36:06.440\n I mean, I'm 37 going on 38 next month.\n\n2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:07.840\n I have a long life to live.\n\n2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:10.720\n I'm definitely not gonna sit on the beach, right?\n\n2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:13.520\n So I'm gonna do something at some point\n\n2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:18.200\n and I gotta imagine I will like help fund it, right?\n\n2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:20.040\n So the other way of thinking about this\n\n2:36:20.040 --> 2:36:21.760\n is you can park your money in the SMP,\n\n2:36:21.760 --> 2:36:22.600\n and this is bad\n\n2:36:22.600 --> 2:36:26.000\n because the SMP has done wonderfully well last year, right?\n\n2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:27.520\n Or you can invest in yourself.\n\n2:36:27.520 --> 2:36:30.800\n And if you're not gonna invest in yourself,\n\n2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:32.120\n you probably shouldn't do a startup.\n\n2:36:32.120 --> 2:36:34.160\n It's kind of the way of thinking about it.\n\n2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:37.760\n And you can invest in yourself in the way Elon does,\n\n2:36:37.760 --> 2:36:41.320\n which is basically go all in on this investment.\n\n2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:43.320\n Maybe that's one way to achieve accountability\n\n2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:46.360\n is like you're kind of screwed if you fail.\n\n2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:49.960\n Yeah, that's, yeah.\n\n2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:50.800\n I personally like that.\n\n2:36:50.800 --> 2:36:52.640\n I like burning bridges behind me\n\n2:36:52.640 --> 2:36:54.920\n so that I'm fucked if it fails.\n\n2:36:57.360 --> 2:36:58.840\n It's really important though.\n\n2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:03.680\n One of the things I think Mark said to me early on\n\n2:37:03.680 --> 2:37:06.320\n that sticks with me that I think is true.\n\n2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:07.560\n We were talking about people\n\n2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:10.480\n who had left like operating roles\n\n2:37:10.480 --> 2:37:11.680\n and started doing venture or something.\n\n2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:13.360\n He was like, a lot of people convince themselves\n\n2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:14.320\n they work really hard.\n\n2:37:14.320 --> 2:37:15.800\n Like they think they work really hard\n\n2:37:15.800 --> 2:37:17.480\n and they put on the show\n\n2:37:17.480 --> 2:37:19.400\n and in their minds they work really hard,\n\n2:37:19.400 --> 2:37:20.920\n but they don't work very hard.\n\n2:37:22.120 --> 2:37:24.880\n There is something about lighting a fire underneath you\n\n2:37:24.880 --> 2:37:28.240\n and burning bridges such that you can't turn back.\n\n2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:31.200\n That I think, we didn't talk about this specifically,\n\n2:37:31.200 --> 2:37:32.360\n but I think you're right.\n\n2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:34.920\n There is, you need to have that\n\n2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:38.240\n because there's the self delusion at a certain scale.\n\n2:37:39.360 --> 2:37:40.920\n Oh, I have so many board calls.\n\n2:37:40.920 --> 2:37:43.120\n Oh, like we have all these things to figure out.\n\n2:37:43.120 --> 2:37:45.960\n It's like, this is one of the hard parts\n\n2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:47.320\n about it being an operator.\n\n2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:50.160\n It's like, there are so many people\n\n2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:52.760\n that have made a lot of money not operating,\n\n2:37:52.760 --> 2:37:55.400\n but operating is just one of the hardest things on earth.\n\n2:37:55.400 --> 2:37:58.160\n It is just so effing hard.\n\n2:37:58.160 --> 2:37:59.320\n It is stressful.\n\n2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:01.440\n It is, you're dealing with real humans,\n\n2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.800\n not just like throwing capital in and hoping it grows.\n\n2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:06.720\n I'm not undermining the VC mindset.\n\n2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:08.480\n I think it's a wonderful thing and needed\n\n2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:11.520\n and so many wonderful VCs I've worked with.\n\n2:38:11.520 --> 2:38:14.760\n But yeah, like when your ass is on the line\n\n2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:16.520\n and it's your money, it's...\n\n2:38:18.560 --> 2:38:21.720\n Talk to me in 10 years, we'll see how it goes.\n\n2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:23.440\n Yeah, but like you were saying, that is a source.\n\n2:38:23.440 --> 2:38:24.680\n When you wake up in the morning\n\n2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:28.880\n and you look forward to the day full of challenges,\n\n2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:31.040\n that's also where you can find happiness.\n\n2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:32.760\n Let me ask you about love and friendship.\n\n2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:33.600\n Sure.\n\n2:38:33.600 --> 2:38:36.680\n What's the role in this heck of a difficult journey\n\n2:38:36.680 --> 2:38:41.680\n you have been on of love, of friendship?\n\n2:38:41.680 --> 2:38:44.080\n What's the role of love in the human condition?\n\n2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:47.280\n Well, first things first,\n\n2:38:47.280 --> 2:38:49.480\n the woman I married, my wife, Nicole,\n\n2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:53.840\n there's no way I could do what I do if we weren't together.\n\n2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:55.120\n She had the filter idea.\n\n2:38:55.120 --> 2:38:56.680\n Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n2:38:56.680 --> 2:38:58.080\n We didn't go over that story.\n\n2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:01.480\n Everything is a partnership, right?\n\n2:39:01.480 --> 2:39:03.840\n And to achieve great things,\n\n2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:06.480\n it's not about like someone pulling their weight in places.\n\n2:39:06.480 --> 2:39:08.840\n Like it's not like someone's supporting you\n\n2:39:08.840 --> 2:39:11.160\n so that you could do this other thing.\n\n2:39:11.160 --> 2:39:12.560\n It's literally like,\n\n2:39:14.440 --> 2:39:18.920\n Mike and I and our partnership as cofounders is fascinating\n\n2:39:18.920 --> 2:39:20.440\n because I don't think Instagram would have happened\n\n2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:21.920\n without that partnership.\n\n2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:25.800\n Like either him or me alone, no way.\n\n2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:28.600\n We pushed and pulled each other in a way\n\n2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:32.360\n that allowed us to build a better thing because of it.\n\n2:39:32.360 --> 2:39:35.840\n Nicole, she pushed me to work on the filters early on.\n\n2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:36.760\n And yes, that's exciting.\n\n2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:38.560\n It's a fun story, right?\n\n2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:41.920\n But the truth of it is being able to like level\n\n2:39:41.920 --> 2:39:44.720\n with someone about how hard the process is\n\n2:39:44.720 --> 2:39:49.320\n and have someone see you for who you are before Instagram\n\n2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:53.240\n and know that there's a constant you throughout all of this\n\n2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:55.960\n and be able to call you when you're drifting from that,\n\n2:39:55.960 --> 2:39:58.360\n but also support you when you're trying to stick with that.\n\n2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:02.920\n That's, I mean, that's true friendship slash love,\n\n2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:04.320\n whatever you want to call it.\n\n2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:07.120\n But also it was for someone not to care.\n\n2:40:07.120 --> 2:40:08.600\n I remember Nicole saying,\n\n2:40:08.600 --> 2:40:10.480\n hey, like I know you're going to do this Instagram thing.\n\n2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:12.880\n You should, I guess it was bourbon at the time.\n\n2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:15.720\n You should do it because, you know,\n\n2:40:15.720 --> 2:40:16.840\n even if it doesn't work,\n\n2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:20.160\n we can move to like a smaller apartment and it'll be fine.\n\n2:40:20.160 --> 2:40:21.360\n Like we'll make it work.\n\n2:40:22.360 --> 2:40:24.200\n How beautiful is that, right?\n\n2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:25.720\n That's almost like a superpower\n\n2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:27.640\n that gives you permission to fail.\n\n2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:29.760\n And somehow that actually leads to success.\n\n2:40:29.760 --> 2:40:31.760\n But also she's like the least impressed\n\n2:40:31.760 --> 2:40:33.520\n about Instagram of anyone.\n\n2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:34.760\n She's like, yeah, it's great.\n\n2:40:34.760 --> 2:40:36.200\n But like, I love you for you.\n\n2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:38.000\n Like, I like that you're like a decent cook.\n\n2:40:38.000 --> 2:40:39.520\n That's beautiful.\n\n2:40:39.520 --> 2:40:42.720\n That's beautiful with the Gantt chart and Thanksgiving,\n\n2:40:42.720 --> 2:40:44.880\n which I still think is a brilliant effing idea.\n\n2:40:44.880 --> 2:40:46.240\n Thank you.\n\n2:40:46.240 --> 2:40:48.280\n Big, ridiculous question.\n\n2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:53.040\n Have you, you're old and wise at this stage.\n\n2:40:53.040 --> 2:40:55.480\n So have you discovered meaning to this whole thing?\n\n2:40:55.480 --> 2:40:59.600\n Why the hell are we descendants of apes here on earth?\n\n2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:00.680\n What's the meaning of it?\n\n2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:01.960\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:02.920\n I haven't.\n\n2:41:02.920 --> 2:41:06.040\n And I am, so the crazy,\n\n2:41:06.040 --> 2:41:09.280\n so the best learning for me has been like,\n\n2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:12.600\n no matter what level of success you achieve,\n\n2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:14.840\n you're still worried about similar things,\n\n2:41:14.840 --> 2:41:16.320\n just maybe on a slightly different scale.\n\n2:41:16.320 --> 2:41:18.920\n You're still concerned about the same thing.\n\n2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:21.120\n You're still self conscious about the same things.\n\n2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:26.120\n Just like, and actually that moment going through that\n\n2:41:26.680 --> 2:41:29.000\n is what makes you believe there's gotta be like\n\n2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.720\n more machinery to life or purpose to life.\n\n2:41:31.720 --> 2:41:35.240\n And that we're all chasing these materialistic things,\n\n2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:38.200\n but you start realizing like,\n\n2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:39.760\n it's almost like, you know, the Truman Show\n\n2:41:39.760 --> 2:41:42.920\n when he gets to the edge and he like knocks against it.\n\n2:41:42.920 --> 2:41:43.760\n He's like, what?\n\n2:41:43.760 --> 2:41:45.840\n Like there's this awakening that happens\n\n2:41:45.840 --> 2:41:47.640\n when you get to that edge that you realize,\n\n2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.640\n oh, like sure, it's great.\n\n2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:53.760\n It's great that we all chase money and fame and success.\n\n2:41:53.760 --> 2:41:56.120\n But you hit the edge and I'm not even claiming\n\n2:41:56.120 --> 2:41:58.240\n I hit an edge like Elon's hit an edge.\n\n2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:00.000\n Like there's clearly larger scales.\n\n2:42:00.000 --> 2:42:02.360\n But what's cool is you learn that,\n\n2:42:02.360 --> 2:42:03.840\n like it doesn't actually matter\n\n2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:07.200\n and that there are all these other things that truly matter.\n\n2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:09.280\n That's not a case for working less hard.\n\n2:42:09.280 --> 2:42:11.480\n That's not a case for taking it easy.\n\n2:42:11.480 --> 2:42:13.920\n That's not a case for the four day work week.\n\n2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:16.640\n What that is a case for is designing your life\n\n2:42:16.640 --> 2:42:18.960\n exactly the way you want to design it.\n\n2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:22.440\n Cause I don't know, I think we go around the earth,\n\n2:42:22.440 --> 2:42:25.040\n you know, the sun a certain number of times\n\n2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:27.640\n and then we die and then that's it.\n\n2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:28.520\n That's me.\n\n2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:30.200\n Are you afraid of that moment?\n\n2:42:30.200 --> 2:42:31.040\n No, not at all.\n\n2:42:31.040 --> 2:42:32.800\n In fact, or at least not yet.\n\n2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:39.560\n Listen, I'm like a pilot, like I do crazy things\n\n2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:43.440\n and I like, no, I like, if anything, I'm like,\n\n2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:48.440\n oh, I got to choose mindfully and purposefully\n\n2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:54.080\n the thing I am doing right now and not just fall into it\n\n2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:55.800\n because you're going to wake up one day and ask yourself\n\n2:42:55.800 --> 2:42:58.400\n why the hell you spent the last 10 years doing X, Y or Z?\n\n2:42:58.400 --> 2:42:59.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:03.720\n So I guess my like shorter answer to this is\n\n2:43:03.720 --> 2:43:08.320\n doing things on purpose because you choose to do them.\n\n2:43:08.320 --> 2:43:11.640\n So important in life and not just like floating\n\n2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:14.680\n down the river of life, hitting branches along the way\n\n2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:17.160\n cause you will hit branches, right?\n\n2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:19.680\n But rather like literally plotting a course\n\n2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:21.080\n and not having a 10 year plan,\n\n2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:23.740\n but just choosing every day to opt in.\n\n2:43:23.740 --> 2:43:28.540\n That I think has been more like,\n\n2:43:28.540 --> 2:43:29.900\n I haven't figured out the meaning of life\n\n2:43:29.900 --> 2:43:31.620\n by any stretch of the imagination,\n\n2:43:31.620 --> 2:43:33.820\n but it certainly isn't money and it certainly isn't fame\n\n2:43:33.820 --> 2:43:35.080\n and it certainly isn't travel.\n\n2:43:35.080 --> 2:43:37.740\n And it's like, and it's way more of like opting\n\n2:43:37.740 --> 2:43:39.400\n into the game you love playing.\n\n2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:41.980\n Every day opting in.\n\n2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:44.820\n Just opting in and like, don't let it happen.\n\n2:43:44.820 --> 2:43:45.760\n You opt in.\n\n2:43:46.920 --> 2:43:51.920\n Kevin, it's great to end on love and the meaning of life.\n\n2:43:51.920 --> 2:43:53.920\n This was an amazing conversation.\n\n2:43:53.920 --> 2:43:54.760\n It was a lot of fun, thank you.\n\n2:43:54.760 --> 2:43:57.880\n You gave me like a light into some fascinating aspects\n\n2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:00.160\n of this technical world.\n\n2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:04.040\n And I can't honestly wait to see what you do next.\n\n2:44:04.040 --> 2:44:05.280\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:44:05.280 --> 2:44:06.320\n Thanks for having me.\n\n2:44:07.380 --> 2:44:09.040\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:44:09.040 --> 2:44:10.480\n with Kevin Systrom.\n\n2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:13.280\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n2:44:13.280 --> 2:44:14.640\n in the description.\n\n2:44:14.640 --> 2:44:16.880\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:44:16.880 --> 2:44:19.520\n from Kevin Systrom himself.\n\n2:44:19.520 --> 2:44:24.240\n Focusing on one thing and doing it really, really well\n\n2:44:24.240 --> 2:44:25.620\n can get you very far.\n\n2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:52.620\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
