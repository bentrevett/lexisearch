00:08.760\n a professor at the University of Pennsylvania,\n\n00:08.760 --> 00:12.880\n a dean of pen engineering, former director of Grasp Lab,\n\n00:12.880 --> 00:15.300\n or the General Robotics Automation Sensing\n\n00:15.300 --> 00:17.560\n and Perception Laboratory at Penn,\n\n00:17.560 --> 00:22.560\n that was established back in 1979, that's 40 years ago.\n\n00:22.600 --> 00:25.280\n Vijay is perhaps best known for his work\n\n00:25.280 --> 00:28.520\n in multi robot systems, robot swarms,\n\n00:28.520 --> 00:30.880\n and micro aerial vehicles,\n\n00:30.880 --> 00:34.020\n robots that elegantly cooperate in flight\n\n00:34.020 --> 00:36.200\n under all the uncertainty and challenges\n\n00:36.200 --> 00:38.760\n that the real world conditions present.\n\n00:38.760 --> 00:41.920\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:41.920 --> 00:44.320\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:44.320 --> 00:47.560\n give it five stars on iTunes, support on

conversation with Vijay Kumar.\n\n00:58.700 --> 01:01.080\n What is the first robot you've ever built\n\n01:01.080 --> 01:02.840\n or were a part of building?\n\n01:02.840 --> 01:04.760\n Way back when I was in graduate school,\n\n01:04.760 --> 01:06.760\n I was part of a fairly big project\n\n01:06.760 --> 01:11.760\n that involved building a very large hexapod.\n\n01:12.040 --> 01:16.700\n It's weighed close to 7,000 pounds,\n\n01:17.520 --> 01:21.620\n and it was powered by hydraulic actuation,\n\n01:21.620 --> 01:26.620\n or it was actuated by hydraulics with 18 motors,\n\n01:27.720 --> 01:32.720\n hydraulic motors, each controlled by an Intel 8085 processor\n\n01:34.160 --> 01:36.680\n and an 8086 co processor.\n\n01:38.120 --> 01:43.120\n And so imagine this huge monster that had 18 joints,\n\n01:44.800 --> 01:46.960\n each controlled by an independent computer,\n\n01:46.960 --> 01:49.320\n and there was a 19th computer that actually did\n\n01:49.320 --> 01:52.320\n the coordination between these 18 joints.\n\n01:52.320 --> 01:53.720\n So I was part of this project,\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:58.720\n and my thesis work was how do you coordinate the 18 legs?\n\n02:02.080 --> 02:06.320\n And in particular, the pressures in the hydraulic cylinders\n\n02:06.320 --> 02:09.200\n to get efficient locomotion.\n\n02:09.200 --> 02:11.640\n It sounds like a giant mess.\n\n02:11.640 --> 02:14.440\n So how difficult is it to make all the motors communicate?\n\n02:14.440 --> 02:17.600\n Presumably, you have to send signals hundreds of times\n\n02:17.600 --> 02:18.440\n a second, or at least.\n\n02:18.440 --> 02:19.880\n So this was not my work,\n\n02:19.880 --> 02:23.960\n but the folks who worked on this wrote what I believe\n\n02:23.960 --> 02:26.640\n to be the first multiprocessor operating system.\n\n02:26.640 --> 02:30.320\n This was in the 80s, and you had to make sure\n\n02:30.320 --> 02:32.800\n that obviously messages got across\n\n02:32.800 --> 02:34.640\n from one joint to another.\n\n02:34.640 --> 02:37.960\n You have to remember the clock speeds on those computers\n\n02:37.960 --> 02:39.660\n were about half a megahertz.\n\n02:39.660 --> 02:42.180\n Right, the 80s.\n\n02:42.180 --> 02:45.320\n So not to romanticize the notion,\n\n02:45.320 --> 02:49.700\n but how did it make you feel to see that robot move?\n\n02:51.080 --> 02:52.280\n It was amazing.\n\n02:52.280 --> 02:55.280\n In hindsight, it looks like, well, we built this thing\n\n02:55.280 --> 02:57.320\n which really should have been much smaller.\n\n02:57.320 --> 02:59.160\n And of course, today's robots are much smaller.\n\n02:59.160 --> 03:03.120\n You look at Boston Dynamics or Ghost Robotics,\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:04.780\n a spinoff from Penn.\n\n03:06.080 --> 03:10.080\n But back then, you were stuck with the substrate you had,\n\n03:10.080 --> 03:13.720\n the compute you had, so things were unnecessarily big.\n\n03:13.720 --> 03:18.040\n But at the same time, and this is just human psychology,\n\n03:18.040 --> 03:20.400\n somehow bigger means grander.\n\n03:21.600 --> 03:23.640\n People never had the same appreciation\n\n03:23.640 --> 03:26.360\n for nanotechnology or nanodevices\n\n03:26.360 --> 03:30.160\n as they do for the Space Shuttle or the Boeing 747.\n\n03:30.160 --> 03:32.760\n Yeah, you've actually done quite a good job\n\n03:32.760 --> 03:36.000\n at illustrating that small is beautiful\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:37.760\n in terms of robotics.\n\n03:37.760 --> 03:42.600\n So what is on that topic is the most beautiful\n\n03:42.600 --> 03:46.200\n or elegant robot in motion that you've ever seen?\n\n03:46.200 --> 03:47.880\n Not to pick favorites or whatever,\n\n03:47.880 --> 03:51.000\n but something that just inspires you that you remember.\n\n03:51.000 --> 03:54.000\n Well, I think the thing that I'm most proud of\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.200\n that my students have done is really think about\n\n03:57.200 --> 04:00.360\n small UAVs that can maneuver in constrained spaces\n\n04:00.360 --> 04:03.640\n and in particular, their ability to coordinate\n\n04:03.640 --> 04:06.760\n with each other and form three dimensional patterns.\n\n04:06.760 --> 04:08.920\n So once you can do that,\n\n04:08.920 --> 04:13.920\n you can essentially create 3D objects in the sky\n\n04:14.960 --> 04:17.680\n and you can deform these objects on the fly.\n\n04:17.680 --> 04:21.560\n So in some sense, your toolbox of what you can create\n\n04:21.560 --> 04:23.400\n has suddenly got enhanced.\n\n04:25.240 --> 04:27.800\n And before that, we did the two dimensional version of this.\n\n04:27.800 --> 04:31.680\n So we had ground robots forming patterns and so on.\n\n04:31.680 --> 04:34.960\n So that was not as impressive, that was not as beautiful.\n\n04:34.960 --> 04:36.560\n But if you do it in 3D,\n\n04:36.560 --> 04:40.240\n suspended in midair, and you've got to go back to 2011\n\n04:40.240 --> 04:43.040\n when we did this, now it's actually pretty standard\n\n04:43.040 --> 04:45.600\n to do these things eight years later.\n\n04:45.600 --> 04:47.680\n But back then it was a big accomplishment.\n\n04:47.680 --> 04:50.280\n So the distributed cooperation\n\n04:50.280 --> 04:53.480\n is where beauty emerges in your eyes?\n\n04:53.480 --> 04:55.800\n Well, I think beauty to an engineer is very different\n\n04:55.800 --> 04:59.400\n from beauty to someone who's looking at robots\n\n04:59.400 --> 05:01.240\n from the outside, if you will.\n\n05:01.240 --> 05:04.800\n But what I meant there, so before we said that grand,\n\n05:04.800 --> 05:09.800\n so before we said that grand is associated with size.\n\n05:10.520 --> 05:13.720\n And another way of thinking about this\n\n05:13.720 --> 05:15.600\n is just the physical shape\n\n05:15.600 --> 05:18.400\n and the idea that you can get physical shapes in midair\n\n05:18.400 --> 05:21.560\n and have them deform, that's beautiful.\n\n05:21.560 --> 05:23.040\n But the individual components,\n\n05:23.040 --> 05:24.880\n the agility is beautiful too, right?\n\n05:24.880 --> 05:25.720\n That is true too.\n\n05:25.720 --> 05:28.480\n So then how quickly can you actually manipulate\n\n05:28.480 --> 05:29.560\n these three dimensional shapes\n\n05:29.560 --> 05:31.280\n and the individual components?\n\n05:31.280 --> 05:32.240\n Yes, you're right.\n\n05:32.240 --> 05:36.760\n But by the way, you said UAV, unmanned aerial vehicle.\n\n05:36.760 --> 05:41.760\n What's a good term for drones, UAVs, quad copters?\n\n05:41.840 --> 05:44.560\n Is there a term that's being standardized?\n\n05:44.560 --> 05:45.440\n I don't know if there is.\n\n05:45.440 --> 05:47.920\n Everybody wants to use the word drones.\n\n05:47.920 --> 05:51.080\n And I've often said this, drones to me is a pejorative word.\n\n05:51.080 --> 05:53.960\n It signifies something that's dumb,\n\n05:53.960 --> 05:56.360\n that's pre programmed, that does one little thing\n\n05:56.360 --> 05:58.600\n and robots are anything but drones.\n\n05:58.600 --> 06:00.680\n So I actually don't like that word,\n\n06:00.680 --> 06:02.960\n but that's what everybody uses.\n\n06:02.960 --> 06:04.880\n You could call it unpiloted.\n\n06:04.880 --> 06:05.800\n Unpiloted.\n\n06:05.800 --> 06:08.120\n But even unpiloted could be radio controlled,\n\n06:08.120 --> 06:11.560\n could be remotely controlled in many different ways.\n\n06:11.560 --> 06:12.960\n And I think the right word is,\n\n06:12.960 --> 06:15.040\n thinking about it as an aerial robot.\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:19.080\n You also say agile, autonomous, aerial robot, right?\n\n06:19.080 --> 06:22.160\n Yeah, so agility is an attribute, but they don't have to be.\n\n06:23.080 --> 06:24.800\n So what biological system,\n\n06:24.800 --> 06:27.200\n because you've also drawn a lot of inspiration with those.\n\n06:27.200 --> 06:30.360\n I've seen bees and ants that you've talked about.\n\n06:30.360 --> 06:35.240\n What living creatures have you found to be most inspiring\n\n06:35.240 --> 06:38.520\n as an engineer, instructive in your work in robotics?\n\n06:38.520 --> 06:43.440\n To me, so ants are really quite incredible creatures, right?\n\n06:43.440 --> 06:47.880\n So you, I mean, the individuals arguably are very simple\n\n06:47.880 --> 06:52.360\n in how they're built and yet they're incredibly resilient\n\n06:52.360 --> 06:53.960\n as a population.\n\n06:53.960 --> 06:56.760\n And as individuals, they're incredibly robust.\n\n06:56.760 --> 07:00.600\n So, if you take an ant, it's six legs,\n\n07:00.600 --> 07:04.120\n you remove one leg, it still works just fine.\n\n07:04.120 --> 07:05.760\n And it moves along.\n\n07:05.760 --> 07:08.720\n And I don't know that he even realizes it's lost a leg.\n\n07:09.760 --> 07:12.520\n So that's the robustness at the individual ant level.\n\n07:13.400 --> 07:15.360\n But then you look about this instinct\n\n07:15.360 --> 07:17.680\n for self preservation of the colonies\n\n07:17.680 --> 07:20.400\n and they adapt in so many amazing ways.\n\n07:20.400 --> 07:25.400\n You know, transcending gaps by just chaining themselves\n\n07:26.800 --> 07:29.600\n together when you have a flood,\n\n07:29.600 --> 07:32.360\n being able to recruit other teammates\n\n07:32.360 --> 07:34.320\n to carry big morsels of food,\n\n07:35.760 --> 07:38.760\n and then going out in different directions looking for food,\n\n07:38.760 --> 07:43.160\n and then being able to demonstrate consensus,\n\n07:43.160 --> 07:47.040\n even though they don't communicate directly with each other\n\n07:47.040 --> 07:49.080\n the way we communicate with each other.\n\n07:49.080 --> 07:51.880\n In some sense, they also know how to do democracy,\n\n07:51.880 --> 07:53.640\n probably better than what we do.\n\n07:53.640 --> 07:57.000\n Yeah, somehow it's even democracy is emergent.\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.120\n It seems like all of the phenomena that we see\n\n07:59.120 --> 08:00.480\n is all emergent.\n\n08:00.480 --> 08:03.560\n It seems like there's no centralized communicator.\n\n08:03.560 --> 08:06.520\n There is, so I think a lot is made about that word,\n\n08:06.520 --> 08:09.640\n emergent, and it means lots of things to different people.\n\n08:09.640 --> 08:10.680\n But you're absolutely right.\n\n08:10.680 --> 08:13.040\n I think as an engineer, you think about\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:17.720\n what element, elemental behaviors\n\n08:17.720 --> 08:21.320\n were primitives you could synthesize\n\n08:21.320 --> 08:25.240\n so that the whole looks incredibly powerful,\n\n08:25.240 --> 08:26.520\n incredibly synergistic,\n\n08:26.520 --> 08:29.520\n the whole definitely being greater than some of the parts,\n\n08:29.520 --> 08:31.480\n and ants are living proof of that.\n\n08:32.480 --> 08:34.960\n So when you see these beautiful swarms\n\n08:34.960 --> 08:37.520\n where there's biological systems of robots,\n\n08:38.520 --> 08:40.200\n do you sometimes think of them\n\n08:40.200 --> 08:44.640\n as a single individual living intelligent organism?\n\n08:44.640 --> 08:47.400\n So it's the same as thinking of our human beings\n\n08:47.400 --> 08:51.160\n are human civilization as one organism,\n\n08:51.160 --> 08:52.960\n or do you still, as an engineer,\n\n08:52.960 --> 08:54.600\n think about the individual components\n\n08:54.600 --> 08:55.440\n and all the engineering\n\n08:55.440 --> 08:57.320\n that went into the individual components?\n\n08:57.320 --> 08:58.640\n Well, that's very interesting.\n\n08:58.640 --> 09:01.480\n So again, philosophically as engineers,\n\n09:01.480 --> 09:05.400\n what we wanna do is to go beyond\n\n09:05.400 --> 09:08.280\n the individual components, the individual units,\n\n09:08.280 --> 09:11.520\n and think about it as a unit, as a cohesive unit,\n\n09:11.520 --> 09:15.120\n without worrying about the individual components.\n\n09:15.120 --> 09:17.760\n If you start obsessing about\n\n09:17.760 --> 09:22.120\n the individual building blocks and what they do,\n\n09:23.320 --> 09:27.960\n you inevitably will find it hard to scale up.\n\n09:27.960 --> 09:29.000\n Just mathematically,\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:31.600\n just think about individual things you wanna model,\n\n09:31.600 --> 09:34.040\n and if you want to have 10 of those,\n\n09:34.040 --> 09:36.440\n then you essentially are taking Cartesian products\n\n09:36.440 --> 09:39.320\n of 10 things, and that makes it really complicated.\n\n09:39.320 --> 09:41.840\n Then to do any kind of synthesis or design\n\n09:41.840 --> 09:44.200\n in that high dimension space is really hard.\n\n09:44.200 --> 09:45.800\n So the right way to do this\n\n09:45.800 --> 09:49.040\n is to think about the individuals in a clever way\n\n09:49.040 --> 09:51.120\n so that at the higher level,\n\n09:51.120 --> 09:53.400\n when you look at lots and lots of them,\n\n09:53.400 --> 09:55.320\n abstractly, you can think of them\n\n09:55.320 --> 09:57.120\n in some low dimensional space.\n\n09:57.120 --> 09:58.680\n So what does that involve?\n\n09:58.680 --> 10:02.160\n For the individual, do you have to try to make\n\n10:02.160 --> 10:05.160\n the way they see the world as local as possible?\n\n10:05.160 --> 10:06.440\n And the other thing,\n\n10:06.440 --> 10:09.560\n do you just have to make them robust to collisions?\n\n10:09.560 --> 10:10.880\n Like you said with the ants,\n\n10:10.880 --> 10:15.320\n if something fails, the whole swarm doesn't fail.\n\n10:15.320 --> 10:17.760\n Right, I think as engineers, we do this.\n\n10:17.760 --> 10:19.760\n I mean, you think about, we build planes,\n\n10:19.760 --> 10:21.240\n or we build iPhones,\n\n10:22.240 --> 10:26.280\n and we know that by taking individual components,\n\n10:26.280 --> 10:30.080\n well engineered components with well specified interfaces\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:31.680\n that behave in a predictable way,\n\n10:31.680 --> 10:33.560\n you can build complex systems.\n\n10:34.440 --> 10:36.880\n So that's ingrained, I would claim,\n\n10:36.880 --> 10:39.400\n in most engineers thinking,\n\n10:39.400 --> 10:41.600\n and it's true for computer scientists as well.\n\n10:41.600 --> 10:44.760\n I think what's different here is that you want\n\n10:44.760 --> 10:49.480\n the individuals to be robust in some sense,\n\n10:49.480 --> 10:52.000\n as we do in these other settings,\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.480\n but you also want some degree of resiliency\n\n10:54.480 --> 10:56.320\n for the population.\n\n10:56.320 --> 11:00.560\n And so you really want them to be able to reestablish\n\n11:02.040 --> 11:03.840\n communication with their neighbors.\n\n11:03.840 --> 11:08.840\n You want them to rethink their strategy for group behavior.\n\n11:08.840 --> 11:10.760\n You want them to reorganize.\n\n11:12.200 --> 11:15.920\n And that's where I think a lot of the challenges lie.\n\n11:15.920 --> 11:18.160\n So just at a high level,\n\n11:18.160 --> 11:20.880\n what does it take for a bunch of,\n\n11:22.200 --> 11:24.440\n what should we call them, flying robots,\n\n11:24.440 --> 11:26.680\n to create a formation?\n\n11:26.680 --> 11:28.680\n Just for people who are not familiar\n\n11:28.680 --> 11:32.760\n with robotics in general, how much information is needed?\n\n11:32.760 --> 11:35.840\n How do you even make it happen\n\n11:35.840 --> 11:39.520\n without a centralized controller?\n\n11:39.520 --> 11:41.080\n So, I mean, there are a couple of different ways\n\n11:41.080 --> 11:43.160\n of looking at this.\n\n11:43.160 --> 11:45.680\n If you are a purist,\n\n11:45.680 --> 11:50.680\n you think of it as a way of recreating what nature does.\n\n11:53.560 --> 11:58.440\n So nature forms groups for several reasons,\n\n11:58.440 --> 12:02.000\n but mostly it's because of this instinct\n\n12:02.000 --> 12:05.680\n that organisms have of preserving their colonies,\n\n12:05.680 --> 12:09.520\n their population, which means what?\n\n12:09.520 --> 12:12.920\n You need shelter, you need food, you need to procreate,\n\n12:12.920 --> 12:14.760\n and that's basically it.\n\n12:14.760 --> 12:18.440\n So the kinds of interactions you see are all organic.\n\n12:18.440 --> 12:19.760\n They're all local.\n\n12:20.760 --> 12:24.080\n And the only information that they share,\n\n12:24.080 --> 12:27.520\n and mostly it's indirectly, is to, again,\n\n12:27.520 --> 12:30.000\n preserve the herd or the flock,\n\n12:30.000 --> 12:35.000\n or the swarm, and either by looking for new sources of food\n\n12:37.480 --> 12:39.440\n or looking for new shelters, right?\n\n12:39.440 --> 12:40.280\n Right.\n\n12:41.240 --> 12:45.360\n As engineers, when we build swarms, we have a mission.\n\n12:46.560 --> 12:51.560\n And when you think of a mission, and it involves mobility,\n\n12:52.480 --> 12:55.000\n most often it's described in some kind\n\n12:55.000 --> 12:56.880\n of a global coordinate system.\n\n12:56.880 --> 12:59.440\n As a human, as an operator, as a commander,\n\n12:59.440 --> 13:03.560\n or as a collaborator, I have my coordinate system,\n\n13:03.560 --> 13:06.640\n and I want the robots to be consistent with that.\n\n13:07.600 --> 13:11.240\n So I might think of it slightly differently.\n\n13:11.240 --> 13:15.440\n I might want the robots to recognize that coordinate system,\n\n13:15.440 --> 13:17.720\n which means not only do they have to think locally\n\n13:17.720 --> 13:19.600\n in terms of who their immediate neighbors are,\n\n13:19.600 --> 13:20.920\n but they have to be cognizant\n\n13:20.920 --> 13:24.040\n of what the global environment is.\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:27.040\n They have to be cognizant of what the global environment\n\n13:27.040 --> 13:28.280\n looks like.\n\n13:28.280 --> 13:31.040\n So if I say, surround this building\n\n13:31.040 --> 13:33.240\n and protect this from intruders,\n\n13:33.240 --> 13:35.600\n well, they're immediately in a building centered\n\n13:35.600 --> 13:37.040\n coordinate system, and I have to tell them\n\n13:37.040 --> 13:38.680\n where the building is.\n\n13:38.680 --> 13:40.040\n And they're globally collaborating\n\n13:40.040 --> 13:41.280\n on the map of that building.\n\n13:41.280 --> 13:44.160\n They're maintaining some kind of global,\n\n13:44.160 --> 13:45.480\n not just in the frame of the building,\n\n13:45.480 --> 13:49.000\n but there's information that's ultimately being built up\n\n13:49.000 --> 13:53.280\n explicitly as opposed to kind of implicitly,\n\n13:53.280 --> 13:54.360\n like nature might.\n\n13:54.360 --> 13:55.200\n Correct, correct.\n\n13:55.200 --> 13:57.680\n So in some sense, nature is very, very sophisticated,\n\n13:57.680 --> 14:01.880\n but the tasks that nature solves or needs to solve\n\n14:01.880 --> 14:05.160\n are very different from the kind of engineered tasks,\n\n14:05.160 --> 14:09.760\n artificial tasks that we are forced to address.\n\n14:09.760 --> 14:12.520\n And again, there's nothing preventing us\n\n14:12.520 --> 14:15.160\n from solving these other problems,\n\n14:15.160 --> 14:16.600\n but ultimately it's about impact.\n\n14:16.600 --> 14:19.360\n You want these swarms to do something useful.\n\n14:19.360 --> 14:24.360\n And so you're kind of driven into this very unnatural,\n\n14:24.640 --> 14:25.480\n if you will.\n\n14:25.480 --> 14:29.160\n Unnatural, meaning not like how nature does, setting.\n\n14:29.160 --> 14:31.920\n And it's probably a little bit more expensive\n\n14:31.920 --> 14:33.760\n to do it the way nature does,\n\n14:33.760 --> 14:37.560\n because nature is less sensitive\n\n14:37.560 --> 14:39.480\n to the loss of the individual.\n\n14:39.480 --> 14:42.280\n And cost wise in robotics,\n\n14:42.280 --> 14:45.480\n I think you're more sensitive to losing individuals.\n\n14:45.480 --> 14:49.000\n I think that's true, although if you look at the price\n\n14:49.000 --> 14:51.520\n to performance ratio of robotic components,\n\n14:51.520 --> 14:54.720\n it's coming down dramatically, right?\n\n14:54.720 --> 14:56.040\n It continues to come down.\n\n14:56.040 --> 14:58.920\n So I think we're asymptotically approaching the point\n\n14:58.920 --> 14:59.960\n where we would get, yeah,\n\n14:59.960 --> 15:05.040\n the cost of individuals would really become insignificant.\n\n15:05.040 --> 15:07.640\n So let's step back at a high level view,\n\n15:07.640 --> 15:12.480\n the impossible question of what kind of, as an overview,\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:14.400\n what kind of autonomous flying vehicles\n\n15:14.400 --> 15:16.200\n are there in general?\n\n15:16.200 --> 15:19.720\n I think the ones that receive a lot of notoriety\n\n15:19.720 --> 15:22.560\n are obviously the military vehicles.\n\n15:22.560 --> 15:26.280\n Military vehicles are controlled by a base station,\n\n15:26.280 --> 15:29.640\n but have a lot of human supervision.\n\n15:29.640 --> 15:31.800\n But they have limited autonomy,\n\n15:31.800 --> 15:34.760\n which is the ability to go from point A to point B.\n\n15:34.760 --> 15:37.080\n And even the more sophisticated now,\n\n15:37.080 --> 15:40.400\n sophisticated vehicles can do autonomous takeoff\n\n15:40.400 --> 15:41.760\n and landing.\n\n15:41.760 --> 15:44.360\n And those usually have wings and they're heavy.\n\n15:44.360 --> 15:45.360\n Usually they're wings,\n\n15:45.360 --> 15:47.440\n but then there's nothing preventing us from doing this\n\n15:47.440 --> 15:49.000\n for helicopters as well.\n\n15:49.000 --> 15:52.480\n There are many military organizations\n\n15:52.480 --> 15:56.560\n that have autonomous helicopters in the same vein.\n\n15:56.560 --> 16:00.080\n And by the way, you look at autopilots and airplanes\n\n16:00.080 --> 16:02.840\n and it's actually very similar.\n\n16:02.840 --> 16:07.160\n In fact, one interesting question we can ask is,\n\n16:07.160 --> 16:12.120\n if you look at all the air safety violations,\n\n16:12.120 --> 16:14.080\n all the crashes that occurred,\n\n16:14.080 --> 16:18.640\n would they have happened if the plane were truly autonomous?\n\n16:18.640 --> 16:21.960\n And I think you'll find that in many of the cases,\n\n16:21.960 --> 16:24.600\n because of pilot error, we made silly decisions.\n\n16:24.600 --> 16:26.960\n And so in some sense, even in air traffic,\n\n16:26.960 --> 16:29.800\n commercial air traffic, there's a lot of applications,\n\n16:29.800 --> 16:33.960\n although we only see autonomy being enabled\n\n16:33.960 --> 16:38.960\n at very high altitudes when the plane is an autopilot.\n\n16:38.960 --> 16:41.960\n The plane is an autopilot.\n\n16:41.960 --> 16:42.800\n There's still a role for the human\n\n16:42.800 --> 16:47.640\n and that kind of autonomy is, you're kind of implying,\n\n16:47.640 --> 16:48.680\n I don't know what the right word is,\n\n16:48.680 --> 16:53.480\n but it's a little dumber than it could be.\n\n16:53.480 --> 16:55.720\n Right, so in the lab, of course,\n\n16:55.720 --> 16:59.200\n we can afford to be a lot more aggressive.\n\n16:59.200 --> 17:04.200\n And the question we try to ask is,\n\n17:04.200 --> 17:09.200\n can we make robots that will be able to make decisions\n\n17:10.360 --> 17:13.680\n without any kind of external infrastructure?\n\n17:13.680 --> 17:14.880\n So what does that mean?\n\n17:14.880 --> 17:16.960\n So the most common piece of infrastructure\n\n17:16.960 --> 17:19.640\n that airplanes use today is GPS.\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:25.160\n GPS is also the most brittle form of information.\n\n17:26.680 --> 17:30.480\n If you have driven in a city, try to use GPS navigation,\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:32.760\n in tall buildings, you immediately lose GPS.\n\n17:32.760 --> 17:36.280\n And so that's not a very sophisticated way\n\n17:36.280 --> 17:37.840\n of building autonomy.\n\n17:37.840 --> 17:39.560\n I think the second piece of infrastructure\n\n17:39.560 --> 17:41.920\n they rely on is communications.\n\n17:41.920 --> 17:46.200\n Again, it's very easy to jam communications.\n\n17:47.360 --> 17:51.320\n In fact, if you use wifi, you know that wifi signals\n\n17:51.320 --> 17:53.520\n drop out, cell signals drop out.\n\n17:53.520 --> 17:56.800\n So to rely on something like that is not good.\n\n17:58.560 --> 18:01.200\n The third form of infrastructure we use,\n\n18:01.200 --> 18:02.920\n and I hate to call it infrastructure,\n\n18:02.920 --> 18:06.360\n but it is that, in the sense of robots, is people.\n\n18:06.360 --> 18:08.640\n So you could rely on somebody to pilot you.\n\n18:09.960 --> 18:11.600\n And so the question you wanna ask is,\n\n18:11.600 --> 18:14.760\n if there are no pilots, there's no communications\n\n18:14.760 --> 18:18.720\n with any base station, if there's no knowledge of position,\n\n18:18.720 --> 18:21.640\n and if there's no a priori map,\n\n18:21.640 --> 18:24.880\n a priori knowledge of what the environment looks like,\n\n18:24.880 --> 18:28.240\n a priori model of what might happen in the future,\n\n18:28.240 --> 18:29.560\n can robots navigate?\n\n18:29.560 --> 18:31.480\n So that is true autonomy.\n\n18:31.480 --> 18:34.160\n So that's true autonomy, and we're talking about,\n\n18:34.160 --> 18:36.880\n you mentioned like military application of drones.\n\n18:36.880 --> 18:38.320\n Okay, so what else is there?\n\n18:38.320 --> 18:42.080\n You talk about agile, autonomous flying robots,\n\n18:42.080 --> 18:45.680\n aerial robots, so that's a different kind of,\n\n18:45.680 --> 18:48.160\n it's not winged, it's not big, at least it's small.\n\n18:48.160 --> 18:50.840\n So I use the word agility mostly,\n\n18:50.840 --> 18:53.520\n or at least we're motivated to do agile robots,\n\n18:53.520 --> 18:58.000\n mostly because robots can operate\n\n18:58.000 --> 19:01.120\n and should be operating in constrained environments.\n\n19:02.120 --> 19:06.960\n And if you want to operate the way a global hawk operates,\n\n19:06.960 --> 19:09.120\n I mean, the kinds of conditions in which you operate\n\n19:09.120 --> 19:10.760\n are very, very restrictive.\n\n19:11.760 --> 19:13.720\n If you wanna go inside a building,\n\n19:13.720 --> 19:15.600\n for example, for search and rescue,\n\n19:15.600 --> 19:18.120\n or to locate an active shooter,\n\n19:18.120 --> 19:22.120\n or you wanna navigate under the canopy in an orchard\n\n19:22.120 --> 19:23.880\n to look at health of plants,\n\n19:23.880 --> 19:28.240\n or to look for, to count fruits,\n\n19:28.240 --> 19:31.240\n to measure the tree trunks.\n\n19:31.240 --> 19:33.240\n These are things we do, by the way.\n\n19:33.240 --> 19:35.400\n There's some cool agriculture stuff you've shown\n\n19:35.400 --> 19:37.080\n in the past, it's really awesome.\n\n19:37.080 --> 19:40.360\n So in those kinds of settings, you do need that agility.\n\n19:40.360 --> 19:42.560\n Agility does not necessarily mean\n\n19:42.560 --> 19:45.440\n you break records for the 100 meters dash.\n\n19:45.440 --> 19:48.000\n What it really means is you see the unexpected\n\n19:48.000 --> 19:51.480\n and you're able to maneuver in a safe way,\n\n19:51.480 --> 19:55.400\n and in a way that gets you the most information\n\n19:55.400 --> 19:57.640\n about the thing you're trying to do.\n\n19:57.640 --> 20:00.440\n By the way, you may be the only person\n\n20:00.440 --> 20:04.200\n who, in a TED Talk, has used a math equation,\n\n20:04.200 --> 20:07.600\n which is amazing, people should go see one of your TED Talks.\n\n20:07.600 --> 20:08.800\n Actually, it's very interesting,\n\n20:08.800 --> 20:12.400\n because the TED curator, Chris Anderson,\n\n20:12.400 --> 20:15.360\n told me, you can't show math.\n\n20:15.360 --> 20:18.200\n And I thought about it, but that's who I am.\n\n20:18.200 --> 20:20.760\n I mean, that's our work.\n\n20:20.760 --> 20:25.760\n And so I felt compelled to give the audience a taste\n\n20:25.760 --> 20:27.640\n for at least some math.\n\n20:27.640 --> 20:32.640\n So on that point, simply, what does it take\n\n20:32.880 --> 20:37.360\n to make a thing with four motors fly, a quadcopter,\n\n20:37.360 --> 20:40.640\n one of these little flying robots?\n\n20:41.760 --> 20:43.960\n How hard is it to make it fly?\n\n20:43.960 --> 20:46.560\n How do you coordinate the four motors?\n\n20:46.560 --> 20:51.560\n How do you convert those motors into actual movement?\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:54.800\n So this is an interesting question.\n\n20:54.800 --> 20:58.080\n We've been trying to do this since 2000.\n\n20:58.080 --> 21:00.560\n It is a commentary on the sensors\n\n21:00.560 --> 21:02.080\n that were available back then,\n\n21:02.080 --> 21:04.280\n the computers that were available back then.\n\n21:05.560 --> 21:10.280\n And a number of things happened between 2000 and 2007.\n\n21:11.520 --> 21:14.120\n One is the advances in computing,\n\n21:14.120 --> 21:16.760\n which is, so we all know about Moore's Law,\n\n21:16.760 --> 21:19.680\n but I think 2007 was a tipping point,\n\n21:19.680 --> 21:22.720\n the year of the iPhone, the year of the cloud.\n\n21:22.720 --> 21:24.640\n Lots of things happened in 2007.\n\n21:25.600 --> 21:27.600\n But going back even further,\n\n21:27.600 --> 21:31.360\n inertial measurement units as a sensor really matured.\n\n21:31.360 --> 21:33.040\n Again, lots of reasons for that.\n\n21:33.920 --> 21:35.400\n Certainly, there's a lot of federal funding,\n\n21:35.400 --> 21:37.360\n particularly DARPA in the US,\n\n21:38.320 --> 21:42.760\n but they didn't anticipate this boom in IMUs.\n\n21:42.760 --> 21:46.560\n But if you look, subsequently what happened\n\n21:46.560 --> 21:50.040\n is that every car manufacturer had to put an airbag in,\n\n21:50.040 --> 21:52.600\n which meant you had to have an accelerometer on board.\n\n21:52.600 --> 21:55.000\n And so that drove down the price to performance ratio.\n\n21:55.000 --> 21:56.880\n Wow, I should know this.\n\n21:56.880 --> 21:57.960\n That's very interesting.\n\n21:57.960 --> 21:59.360\n That's very interesting, the connection there.\n\n21:59.360 --> 22:01.320\n And that's why research is very,\n\n22:01.320 --> 22:03.280\n it's very hard to predict the outcomes.\n\n22:04.840 --> 22:07.640\n And again, the federal government spent a ton of money\n\n22:07.640 --> 22:12.280\n on things that they thought were useful for resonators,\n\n22:12.280 --> 22:16.840\n but it ended up enabling these small UAVs, which is great,\n\n22:16.840 --> 22:18.520\n because I could have never raised that much money\n\n22:18.520 --> 22:20.760\n and sold this project,\n\n22:20.760 --> 22:22.200\n hey, we want to build these small UAVs.\n\n22:22.200 --> 22:25.440\n Can you actually fund the development of low cost IMUs?\n\n22:25.440 --> 22:27.600\n So why do you need an IMU on an IMU?\n\n22:27.600 --> 22:31.000\n So I'll come back to that.\n\n22:31.000 --> 22:33.320\n So in 2007, 2008, we were able to build these.\n\n22:33.320 --> 22:35.200\n And then the question you're asking was a good one.\n\n22:35.200 --> 22:40.240\n How do you coordinate the motors to develop this?\n\n22:40.240 --> 22:43.880\n But over the last 10 years, everything is commoditized.\n\n22:43.880 --> 22:46.240\n A high school kid today can pick up\n\n22:46.240 --> 22:50.560\n a Raspberry Pi kit and build this.\n\n22:50.560 --> 22:53.200\n All the low levels functionality is all automated.\n\n22:54.160 --> 22:56.360\n But basically at some level,\n\n22:56.360 --> 23:01.360\n you have to drive the motors at the right RPMs,\n\n23:01.360 --> 23:03.680\n the right velocity,\n\n23:04.560 --> 23:07.480\n in order to generate the right amount of thrust,\n\n23:07.480 --> 23:10.360\n in order to position it and orient it in a way\n\n23:10.360 --> 23:12.840\n that you need to in order to fly.\n\n23:13.800 --> 23:16.680\n The feedback that you get is from onboard sensors,\n\n23:16.680 --> 23:18.400\n and the IMU is an important part of it.\n\n23:18.400 --> 23:23.400\n The IMU tells you what the acceleration is,\n\n23:23.840 --> 23:26.400\n as well as what the angular velocity is.\n\n23:26.400 --> 23:29.200\n And those are important pieces of information.\n\n23:30.440 --> 23:34.200\n In addition to that, you need some kind of local position\n\n23:34.200 --> 23:37.480\n or velocity information.\n\n23:37.480 --> 23:39.360\n For example, when we walk,\n\n23:39.360 --> 23:41.560\n we implicitly have this information\n\n23:41.560 --> 23:45.840\n because we kind of know what our stride length is.\n\n23:46.720 --> 23:51.480\n We also are looking at images fly past our retina,\n\n23:51.480 --> 23:54.280\n if you will, and so we can estimate velocity.\n\n23:54.280 --> 23:56.360\n We also have accelerometers in our head,\n\n23:56.360 --> 23:59.160\n and we're able to integrate all these pieces of information\n\n23:59.160 --> 24:02.360\n to determine where we are as we walk.\n\n24:02.360 --> 24:04.320\n And so robots have to do something very similar.\n\n24:04.320 --> 24:08.160\n You need an IMU, you need some kind of a camera\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:11.640\n or other sensor that's measuring velocity,\n\n24:12.560 --> 24:15.800\n and then you need some kind of a global reference frame\n\n24:15.800 --> 24:19.520\n if you really want to think about doing something\n\n24:19.520 --> 24:21.280\n in a world coordinate system.\n\n24:21.280 --> 24:23.680\n And so how do you estimate your position\n\n24:23.680 --> 24:25.160\n with respect to that global reference frame?\n\n24:25.160 --> 24:26.560\n That's important as well.\n\n24:26.560 --> 24:29.520\n So coordinating the RPMs of the four motors\n\n24:29.520 --> 24:32.640\n is what allows you to, first of all, fly and hover,\n\n24:32.640 --> 24:35.600\n and then you can change the orientation\n\n24:35.600 --> 24:37.600\n and the velocity and so on.\n\n24:37.600 --> 24:38.440\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n24:38.440 --> 24:40.320\n So it's a bunch of degrees of freedom\n\n24:40.320 --> 24:41.160\n that you're complaining about.\n\n24:41.160 --> 24:42.200\n There's six degrees of freedom,\n\n24:42.200 --> 24:44.920\n but you only have four inputs, the four motors.\n\n24:44.920 --> 24:49.920\n And it turns out to be a remarkably versatile configuration.\n\n24:50.920 --> 24:53.080\n You think at first, well, I only have four motors,\n\n24:53.080 --> 24:55.000\n how do I go sideways?\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:57.280\n But it's not too hard to say, well, if I tilt myself,\n\n24:57.280 --> 25:00.440\n I can go sideways, and then you have four motors\n\n25:00.440 --> 25:03.320\n pointing up, how do I rotate in place\n\n25:03.320 --> 25:05.360\n about a vertical axis?\n\n25:05.360 --> 25:07.800\n Well, you rotate them at different speeds\n\n25:07.800 --> 25:09.720\n and that generates reaction moments\n\n25:09.720 --> 25:11.520\n and that allows you to turn.\n\n25:11.520 --> 25:14.960\n So it's actually a pretty, it's an optimal configuration\n\n25:14.960 --> 25:17.040\n from an engineer standpoint.\n\n25:18.360 --> 25:23.360\n It's very simple, very cleverly done, and very versatile.\n\n25:23.360 --> 25:27.240\n So if you could step back to a time,\n\n25:27.240 --> 25:30.000\n so I've always known flying robots as,\n\n25:31.040 --> 25:35.760\n to me, it was natural that a quadcopter should fly.\n\n25:35.760 --> 25:37.880\n But when you first started working with it,\n\n25:38.800 --> 25:42.000\n how surprised are you that you can make,\n\n25:42.000 --> 25:45.520\n do so much with the four motors?\n\n25:45.520 --> 25:47.600\n How surprising is it that you can make this thing fly,\n\n25:47.600 --> 25:49.760\n first of all, that you can make it hover,\n\n25:49.760 --> 25:52.000\n that you can add control to it?\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:55.080\n Firstly, this is not, the four motor configuration\n\n25:55.080 --> 25:56.400\n is not ours.\n\n25:56.400 --> 25:59.320\n You can, it has at least a hundred year history.\n\n26:00.320 --> 26:04.160\n And various people, various people try to get quadrotors\n\n26:04.160 --> 26:06.840\n to fly without much success.\n\n26:08.480 --> 26:10.760\n As I said, we've been working on this since 2000.\n\n26:10.760 --> 26:14.400\n Our first designs were, well, this is way too complicated.\n\n26:14.400 --> 26:18.480\n Why not we try to get an omnidirectional flying robot?\n\n26:18.480 --> 26:21.760\n So our early designs, we had eight rotors.\n\n26:21.760 --> 26:25.200\n And so these eight rotors were arranged uniformly\n\n26:26.600 --> 26:28.000\n on a sphere, if you will.\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:30.440\n So you can imagine a symmetric configuration.\n\n26:30.440 --> 26:33.280\n And so you should be able to fly anywhere.\n\n26:33.280 --> 26:36.240\n But the real challenge we had is the strength to weight ratio\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:37.080\n is not enough.\n\n26:37.080 --> 26:39.680\n And of course, we didn't have the sensors and so on.\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:43.040\n So everybody knew, or at least the people\n\n26:43.040 --> 26:44.800\n who worked with rotorcrafts knew,\n\n26:44.800 --> 26:46.520\n four rotors will get it done.\n\n26:47.520 --> 26:49.400\n So that was not our idea.\n\n26:49.400 --> 26:52.800\n But it took a while before we could actually do\n\n26:52.800 --> 26:56.920\n the onboard sensing and the computation that was needed\n\n26:56.920 --> 27:01.000\n for the kinds of agile maneuvering that we wanted to do\n\n27:01.000 --> 27:03.000\n in our little aerial robots.\n\n27:03.000 --> 27:07.560\n And that only happened between 2007 and 2009 in our lab.\n\n27:07.560 --> 27:09.960\n Yeah, and you have to send the signal\n\n27:09.960 --> 27:12.480\n maybe a hundred times a second.\n\n27:12.480 --> 27:15.960\n So the compute there, everything has to come down in price.\n\n27:15.960 --> 27:20.960\n And what are the steps of getting from point A to point B?\n\n27:21.720 --> 27:25.200\n So we just talked about like local control.\n\n27:25.200 --> 27:30.200\n But if all the kind of cool dancing in the air\n\n27:30.840 --> 27:34.520\n that I've seen you show, how do you make it happen?\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:37.360\n How do you make a trajectory?\n\n27:37.360 --> 27:40.520\n First of all, okay, figure out a trajectory.\n\n27:40.520 --> 27:41.680\n So plan a trajectory.\n\n27:41.680 --> 27:44.400\n And then how do you make that trajectory happen?\n\n27:44.400 --> 27:47.280\n Yeah, I think planning is a very fundamental problem\n\n27:47.280 --> 27:48.120\n in robotics.\n\n27:48.120 --> 27:50.800\n I think 10 years ago it was an esoteric thing,\n\n27:50.800 --> 27:53.040\n but today with self driving cars,\n\n27:53.040 --> 27:55.840\n everybody can understand this basic idea\n\n27:55.840 --> 27:57.920\n that a car sees a whole bunch of things\n\n27:57.920 --> 28:00.320\n and it has to keep a lane or maybe make a right turn\n\n28:00.320 --> 28:01.280\n or switch lanes.\n\n28:01.280 --> 28:02.680\n It has to plan a trajectory.\n\n28:02.680 --> 28:03.560\n It has to be safe.\n\n28:03.560 --> 28:04.840\n It has to be efficient.\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:06.640\n So everybody's familiar with that.\n\n28:06.640 --> 28:10.240\n That's kind of the first step that you have to think about\n\n28:10.240 --> 28:14.800\n when you say autonomy.\n\n28:14.800 --> 28:19.120\n And so for us, it's about finding smooth motions,\n\n28:19.120 --> 28:21.320\n motions that are safe.\n\n28:21.320 --> 28:22.880\n So we think about these two things.\n\n28:22.880 --> 28:24.680\n One is optimality, one is safety.\n\n28:24.680 --> 28:27.200\n Clearly you cannot compromise safety.\n\n28:28.440 --> 28:31.360\n So you're looking for safe, optimal motions.\n\n28:31.360 --> 28:34.480\n The other thing you have to think about is\n\n28:34.480 --> 28:38.160\n can you actually compute a reasonable trajectory\n\n28:38.160 --> 28:40.760\n in a small amount of time?\n\n28:40.760 --> 28:42.280\n Cause you have a time budget.\n\n28:42.280 --> 28:45.160\n So the optimal becomes suboptimal,\n\n28:45.160 --> 28:50.160\n but in our lab we focus on synthesizing smooth trajectory\n\n28:51.160 --> 28:53.000\n that satisfy all the constraints.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:57.120\n In other words, don't violate any safety constraints\n\n28:58.440 --> 29:02.880\n and is as efficient as possible.\n\n29:02.880 --> 29:04.360\n And when I say efficient,\n\n29:04.360 --> 29:06.600\n it could mean I want to get from point A to point B\n\n29:06.600 --> 29:08.360\n as quickly as possible,\n\n29:08.360 --> 29:11.840\n or I want to get to it as gracefully as possible,\n\n29:12.840 --> 29:15.960\n or I want to consume as little energy as possible.\n\n29:15.960 --> 29:18.240\n But always staying within the safety constraints.\n\n29:18.240 --> 29:22.800\n But yes, always finding a safe trajectory.\n\n29:22.800 --> 29:25.040\n So there's a lot of excitement and progress\n\n29:25.040 --> 29:27.360\n in the field of machine learning\n\n29:27.360 --> 29:29.360\n and reinforcement learning\n\n29:29.360 --> 29:32.200\n and the neural network variant of that\n\n29:32.200 --> 29:33.920\n with deep reinforcement learning.\n\n29:33.920 --> 29:36.360\n Do you see a role of machine learning\n\n29:36.360 --> 29:40.560\n in, so a lot of the success of flying robots\n\n29:40.560 --> 29:42.320\n did not rely on machine learning,\n\n29:42.320 --> 29:45.040\n except for maybe a little bit of the perception\n\n29:45.040 --> 29:46.600\n on the computer vision side.\n\n29:46.600 --> 29:48.440\n On the control side and the planning,\n\n29:48.440 --> 29:50.400\n do you see there's a role in the future\n\n29:50.400 --> 29:51.680\n for machine learning?\n\n29:51.680 --> 29:53.800\n So let me disagree a little bit with you.\n\n29:53.800 --> 29:56.800\n I think we never perhaps called out in my work,\n\n29:56.800 --> 29:57.720\n called out learning,\n\n29:57.720 --> 30:00.600\n but even this very simple idea of being able to fly\n\n30:00.600 --> 30:02.200\n through a constrained space.\n\n30:02.200 --> 30:05.680\n The first time you try it, you'll invariably,\n\n30:05.680 --> 30:08.440\n you might get it wrong if the task is challenging.\n\n30:08.440 --> 30:12.200\n And the reason is to get it perfectly right,\n\n30:12.200 --> 30:14.600\n you have to model everything in the environment.\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:19.960\n And flying is notoriously hard to model.\n\n30:19.960 --> 30:24.960\n There are aerodynamic effects that we constantly discover.\n\n30:26.520 --> 30:29.440\n Even just before I was talking to you,\n\n30:29.440 --> 30:33.440\n I was talking to a student about how blades flap\n\n30:33.440 --> 30:35.320\n when they fly.\n\n30:35.320 --> 30:40.320\n And that ends up changing how a rotorcraft\n\n30:40.880 --> 30:43.960\n is accelerated in the angular direction.\n\n30:43.960 --> 30:46.360\n Does he use like micro flaps or something?\n\n30:46.360 --> 30:47.280\n It's not micro flaps.\n\n30:47.280 --> 30:49.640\n So we assume that each blade is rigid,\n\n30:49.640 --> 30:51.720\n but actually it flaps a little bit.\n\n30:51.720 --> 30:52.880\n It bends.\n\n30:52.880 --> 30:53.720\n Interesting, yeah.\n\n30:53.720 --> 30:56.040\n And so the models rely on the fact,\n\n30:56.040 --> 30:58.640\n on the assumption that they're not rigid.\n\n30:58.640 --> 31:00.640\n On the assumption that they're actually rigid,\n\n31:00.640 --> 31:02.240\n but that's not true.\n\n31:02.240 --> 31:03.720\n If you're flying really quickly,\n\n31:03.720 --> 31:06.920\n these effects become significant.\n\n31:06.920 --> 31:09.240\n If you're flying close to the ground,\n\n31:09.240 --> 31:12.160\n you get pushed off by the ground, right?\n\n31:12.160 --> 31:14.920\n Something which every pilot knows when he tries to land\n\n31:14.920 --> 31:18.000\n or she tries to land, this is called a ground effect.\n\n31:18.920 --> 31:21.000\n Something very few pilots think about\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:23.040\n is what happens when you go close to a ceiling\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:25.320\n or you get sucked into a ceiling.\n\n31:25.320 --> 31:26.880\n There are very few aircrafts\n\n31:26.880 --> 31:29.520\n that fly close to any kind of ceiling.\n\n31:29.520 --> 31:33.520\n Likewise, when you go close to a wall,\n\n31:33.520 --> 31:35.720\n there are these wall effects.\n\n31:35.720 --> 31:37.680\n And if you've gone on a train\n\n31:37.680 --> 31:39.600\n and you pass another train that's traveling\n\n31:39.600 --> 31:42.400\n in the opposite direction, you feel the buffeting.\n\n31:42.400 --> 31:45.400\n And so these kinds of microclimates\n\n31:45.400 --> 31:47.880\n affect our UAV significantly.\n\n31:47.880 --> 31:48.720\n So if you want...\n\n31:48.720 --> 31:50.640\n And they're impossible to model, essentially.\n\n31:50.640 --> 31:52.480\n I wouldn't say they're impossible to model,\n\n31:52.480 --> 31:54.880\n but the level of sophistication you would need\n\n31:54.880 --> 31:58.600\n in the model and the software would be tremendous.\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:02.920\n Plus, to get everything right would be awfully tedious.\n\n32:02.920 --> 32:05.080\n So the way we do this is over time,\n\n32:05.080 --> 32:09.000\n we figure out how to adapt to these conditions.\n\n32:10.360 --> 32:13.160\n So early on, we use the form of learning\n\n32:13.160 --> 32:15.760\n that we call iterative learning.\n\n32:15.760 --> 32:18.600\n So this idea, if you want to perform a task,\n\n32:18.600 --> 32:22.120\n there are a few things that you need to change\n\n32:22.120 --> 32:24.960\n and iterate over a few parameters\n\n32:24.960 --> 32:29.280\n that over time you can figure out.\n\n32:29.280 --> 32:33.400\n So I could call it policy gradient reinforcement learning,\n\n32:33.400 --> 32:34.920\n but actually it was just iterative learning.\n\n32:34.920 --> 32:36.000\n Iterative learning.\n\n32:36.000 --> 32:37.800\n And so this was there way back.\n\n32:37.800 --> 32:39.440\n I think what's interesting is,\n\n32:39.440 --> 32:41.640\n if you look at autonomous vehicles today,\n\n32:43.120 --> 32:45.680\n learning occurs, could occur in two pieces.\n\n32:45.680 --> 32:47.960\n One is perception, understanding the world.\n\n32:47.960 --> 32:50.080\n Second is action, taking actions.\n\n32:50.080 --> 32:52.240\n Everything that I've seen that is successful\n\n32:52.240 --> 32:54.360\n is on the perception side of things.\n\n32:54.360 --> 32:55.400\n So in computer vision,\n\n32:55.400 --> 32:57.840\n we've made amazing strides in the last 10 years.\n\n32:57.840 --> 33:01.640\n So recognizing objects, actually detecting objects,\n\n33:01.640 --> 33:06.400\n classifying them and tagging them in some sense,\n\n33:06.400 --> 33:07.440\n annotating them.\n\n33:07.440 --> 33:09.640\n This is all done through machine learning.\n\n33:09.640 --> 33:12.160\n On the action side, on the other hand,\n\n33:12.160 --> 33:13.720\n I don't know of any examples\n\n33:13.720 --> 33:15.560\n where there are fielded systems\n\n33:15.560 --> 33:17.560\n where we actually learn\n\n33:17.560 --> 33:20.560\n the right behavior.\n\n33:20.560 --> 33:22.760\n Outside of single demonstration is successful.\n\n33:22.760 --> 33:24.640\n In the laboratory, this is the holy grail.\n\n33:24.640 --> 33:26.040\n Can you do end to end learning?\n\n33:26.040 --> 33:28.800\n Can you go from pixels to motor currents?\n\n33:30.200 --> 33:31.600\n This is really, really hard.\n\n33:32.800 --> 33:35.080\n And I think if you go forward,\n\n33:35.080 --> 33:37.600\n the right way to think about these things\n\n33:37.600 --> 33:40.720\n is data driven approaches,\n\n33:40.720 --> 33:42.400\n learning based approaches,\n\n33:42.400 --> 33:45.280\n in concert with model based approaches,\n\n33:45.280 --> 33:47.320\n which is the traditional way of doing things.\n\n33:47.320 --> 33:48.720\n So I think there's a piece,\n\n33:48.720 --> 33:51.400\n there's a role for each of these methodologies.\n\n33:51.400 --> 33:52.440\n So what do you think,\n\n33:52.440 --> 33:53.880\n just jumping out on topic\n\n33:53.880 --> 33:56.200\n since you mentioned autonomous vehicles,\n\n33:56.200 --> 33:58.480\n what do you think are the limits on the perception side?\n\n33:58.480 --> 34:01.080\n So I've talked to Elon Musk\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:03.320\n and there on the perception side,\n\n34:03.320 --> 34:05.960\n they're using primarily computer vision\n\n34:05.960 --> 34:08.080\n to perceive the environment.\n\n34:08.080 --> 34:09.760\n In your work with,\n\n34:09.760 --> 34:12.560\n because you work with the real world a lot\n\n34:12.560 --> 34:13.720\n and the physical world,\n\n34:13.720 --> 34:15.800\n what are the limits of computer vision?\n\n34:15.800 --> 34:18.000\n Do you think we can solve autonomous vehicles\n\n34:19.160 --> 34:20.880\n on the perception side,\n\n34:20.880 --> 34:24.240\n focusing on vision alone and machine learning?\n\n34:24.240 --> 34:27.480\n So, we also have a spinoff company,\n\n34:27.480 --> 34:31.840\n Exxon Technologies that works underground in mines.\n\n34:31.840 --> 34:35.600\n So you go into mines, they're dark, they're dirty.\n\n34:36.480 --> 34:38.600\n You fly in a dirty area,\n\n34:38.600 --> 34:41.120\n there's stuff you kick up from by the propellers,\n\n34:41.120 --> 34:42.720\n the downwash kicks up dust.\n\n34:42.720 --> 34:45.520\n I challenge you to get a computer vision algorithm\n\n34:45.520 --> 34:46.680\n to work there.\n\n34:46.680 --> 34:49.600\n So we use LIDARs in that setting.\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:55.360\n Indoors and even outdoors when we fly through fields,\n\n34:55.360 --> 34:57.120\n I think there's a lot of potential\n\n34:57.120 --> 34:59.960\n for just solving the problem using computer vision alone.\n\n35:01.240 --> 35:02.760\n But I think the bigger question is,\n\n35:02.760 --> 35:06.160\n can you actually solve\n\n35:06.160 --> 35:09.440\n or can you actually identify all the corner cases\n\n35:09.440 --> 35:13.920\n using a single sensing modality and using learning alone?\n\n35:13.920 --> 35:15.400\n So what's your intuition there?\n\n35:15.400 --> 35:17.920\n So look, if you have a corner case\n\n35:17.920 --> 35:20.000\n and your algorithm doesn't work,\n\n35:20.000 --> 35:23.200\n your instinct is to go get data about the corner case\n\n35:23.200 --> 35:26.640\n and patch it up, learn how to deal with that corner case.\n\n35:27.640 --> 35:32.040\n But at some point, this is gonna saturate,\n\n35:32.040 --> 35:34.200\n this approach is not viable.\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:38.000\n So today, computer vision algorithms can detect\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:41.360\n 90% of the objects or can detect objects 90% of the time,\n\n35:41.360 --> 35:43.920\n classify them 90% of the time.\n\n35:43.920 --> 35:47.960\n Cats on the internet probably can do 95%, I don't know.\n\n35:47.960 --> 35:52.520\n But to get from 90% to 99%, you need a lot more data.\n\n35:52.520 --> 35:54.480\n And then I tell you, well, that's not enough\n\n35:54.480 --> 35:56.680\n because I have a safety critical application,\n\n35:56.680 --> 36:00.160\n I wanna go from 99% to 99.9%.\n\n36:00.160 --> 36:01.600\n That's even more data.\n\n36:01.600 --> 36:08.600\n So I think if you look at wanting accuracy on the X axis\n\n36:09.600 --> 36:14.080\n and look at the amount of data on the Y axis,\n\n36:14.080 --> 36:16.440\n I believe that curve is an exponential curve.\n\n36:16.440 --> 36:19.480\n Wow, okay, it's even hard if it's linear.\n\n36:19.480 --> 36:20.800\n It's hard if it's linear, totally,\n\n36:20.800 --> 36:22.560\n but I think it's exponential.\n\n36:22.560 --> 36:24.120\n And the other thing you have to think about\n\n36:24.120 --> 36:29.600\n is that this process is a very, very power hungry process\n\n36:29.600 --> 36:32.880\n to run data farms or servers.\n\n36:32.880 --> 36:34.600\n Power, do you mean literally power?\n\n36:34.600 --> 36:36.600\n Literally power, literally power.\n\n36:36.600 --> 36:41.760\n So in 2014, five years ago, and I don't have more recent data,\n\n36:41.760 --> 36:48.360\n 2% of US electricity consumption was from data farms.\n\n36:48.360 --> 36:52.080\n So we think about this as an information science\n\n36:52.080 --> 36:54.240\n and information processing problem.\n\n36:54.240 --> 36:57.840\n Actually, it is an energy processing problem.\n\n36:57.840 --> 37:00.440\n And so unless we figured out better ways of doing this,\n\n37:00.440 --> 37:02.440\n I don't think this is viable.\n\n37:02.440 --> 37:06.600\n So talking about driving, which is a safety critical application\n\n37:06.600 --> 37:10.440\n and some aspect of flight is safety critical,\n\n37:10.440 --> 37:12.960\n maybe philosophical question, maybe an engineering one,\n\n37:12.960 --> 37:15.000\n what problem do you think is harder to solve,\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.120\n autonomous driving or autonomous flight?\n\n37:18.120 --> 37:19.920\n That's a really interesting question.\n\n37:19.920 --> 37:25.440\n I think autonomous flight has several advantages\n\n37:25.440 --> 37:29.360\n that autonomous driving doesn't have.\n\n37:29.360 --> 37:32.400\n So look, if I want to go from point A to point B,\n\n37:32.400 --> 37:34.320\n I have a very, very safe trajectory.\n\n37:34.320 --> 37:36.800\n Go vertically up to a maximum altitude,\n\n37:36.800 --> 37:39.480\n fly horizontally to just about the destination,\n\n37:39.480 --> 37:42.400\n and then come down vertically.\n\n37:42.400 --> 37:45.400\n This is preprogrammed.\n\n37:45.400 --> 37:48.040\n The equivalent of that is very hard to find\n\n37:48.040 --> 37:51.560\n in the self driving car world because you're on the ground,\n\n37:51.560 --> 37:53.560\n you're in a two dimensional surface,\n\n37:53.560 --> 37:56.680\n and the trajectories on the two dimensional surface\n\n37:56.680 --> 38:00.200\n are more likely to encounter obstacles.\n\n38:00.200 --> 38:03.280\n I mean this in an intuitive sense, but mathematically true.\n\n38:03.280 --> 38:06.360\n That's mathematically as well, that's true.\n\n38:06.360 --> 38:10.040\n There's other option on the 2G space of platooning,\n\n38:10.040 --> 38:11.640\n or because there's so many obstacles,\n\n38:11.640 --> 38:13.280\n you can connect with those obstacles\n\n38:13.280 --> 38:14.560\n and all these kind of options.\n\n38:14.560 --> 38:16.560\n Sure, but those exist in the three dimensional space as well.\n\n38:16.560 --> 38:17.560\n So they do.\n\n38:17.560 --> 38:21.800\n So the question also implies how difficult are obstacles\n\n38:21.800 --> 38:23.800\n in the three dimensional space in flight?\n\n38:23.800 --> 38:25.600\n So that's the downside.\n\n38:25.600 --> 38:26.920\n I think in three dimensional space,\n\n38:26.920 --> 38:29.080\n you're modeling three dimensional world,\n\n38:29.080 --> 38:31.280\n not just because you want to avoid it,\n\n38:31.280 --> 38:33.040\n but you want to reason about it,\n\n38:33.040 --> 38:35.360\n and you want to work in the three dimensional environment,\n\n38:35.360 --> 38:37.480\n and that's significantly harder.\n\n38:37.480 --> 38:38.920\n So that's one disadvantage.\n\n38:38.920 --> 38:41.040\n I think the second disadvantage is of course,\n\n38:41.040 --> 38:43.200\n anytime you fly, you have to put up\n\n38:43.200 --> 38:46.560\n with the peculiarities of aerodynamics\n\n38:46.560 --> 38:48.720\n and their complicated environments.\n\n38:48.720 --> 38:49.800\n How do you negotiate that?\n\n38:49.800 --> 38:51.880\n So that's always a problem.\n\n38:51.880 --> 38:55.240\n Do you see a time in the future where there is,\n\n38:55.240 --> 38:58.720\n you mentioned there's agriculture applications.\n\n38:58.720 --> 39:01.680\n So there's a lot of applications of flying robots,\n\n39:01.680 --> 39:03.040\n but do you see a time in the future\n\n39:03.040 --> 39:05.360\n where there's tens of thousands,\n\n39:05.360 --> 39:08.160\n or maybe hundreds of thousands of delivery drones\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:12.160\n that fill the sky, delivery flying robots?\n\n39:12.160 --> 39:14.200\n I think there's a lot of potential\n\n39:14.200 --> 39:15.920\n for the last mile delivery.\n\n39:15.920 --> 39:19.240\n And so in crowded cities, I don't know,\n\n39:19.240 --> 39:21.400\n if you go to a place like Hong Kong,\n\n39:21.400 --> 39:24.400\n just crossing the river can take half an hour,\n\n39:24.400 --> 39:29.400\n and while a drone can just do it in five minutes at most.\n\n39:29.400 --> 39:34.400\n I think you look at delivery of supplies to remote villages.\n\n39:35.800 --> 39:38.680\n I work with a nonprofit called Weave Robotics.\n\n39:38.680 --> 39:40.920\n So they work in the Peruvian Amazon,\n\n39:40.920 --> 39:44.680\n where the only highways that are available\n\n39:44.680 --> 39:47.440\n are the only highways or rivers.\n\n39:47.440 --> 39:52.440\n And to get from point A to point B may take five hours,\n\n39:52.960 --> 39:55.600\n while with a drone, you can get there in 30 minutes.\n\n39:56.680 --> 39:59.880\n So just delivering drugs,\n\n39:59.880 --> 40:04.880\n retrieving samples for testing vaccines,\n\n40:05.160 --> 40:07.120\n I think there's huge potential here.\n\n40:07.120 --> 40:09.960\n So I think the challenges are not technological,\n\n40:09.960 --> 40:12.040\n but the challenge is economical.\n\n40:12.040 --> 40:15.560\n The one thing I'll tell you that nobody thinks about\n\n40:15.560 --> 40:18.920\n is the fact that we've not made huge strides\n\n40:18.920 --> 40:20.840\n in battery technology.\n\n40:20.840 --> 40:23.520\n Yes, it's true, batteries are becoming less expensive\n\n40:23.520 --> 40:26.240\n because we have these mega factories that are coming up,\n\n40:26.240 --> 40:28.800\n but they're all based on lithium based technologies.\n\n40:28.800 --> 40:31.480\n And if you look at the energy density\n\n40:31.480 --> 40:33.240\n and the power density,\n\n40:33.240 --> 40:38.000\n those are two fundamentally limiting numbers.\n\n40:38.000 --> 40:39.680\n So power density is important\n\n40:39.680 --> 40:42.480\n because for a UAV to take off vertically into the air,\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:46.360\n which most drones do, they don't have a runway,\n\n40:46.360 --> 40:50.240\n you consume roughly 200 watts per kilo at the small size.\n\n40:51.560 --> 40:53.920\n That's a lot, right?\n\n40:53.920 --> 40:57.520\n In contrast, the human brain consumes less than 80 watts,\n\n40:57.520 --> 40:58.920\n the whole of the human brain.\n\n40:59.920 --> 41:03.600\n So just imagine just lifting yourself into the air\n\n41:03.600 --> 41:06.000\n is like two or three light bulbs,\n\n41:06.000 --> 41:07.840\n which makes no sense to me.\n\n41:07.840 --> 41:10.440\n Yeah, so you're going to have to at scale\n\n41:10.440 --> 41:12.880\n solve the energy problem then,\n\n41:12.880 --> 41:17.880\n charging the batteries, storing the energy and so on.\n\n41:18.920 --> 41:20.680\n And then the storage is the second problem,\n\n41:20.680 --> 41:22.960\n but storage limits the range.\n\n41:22.960 --> 41:27.960\n But you have to remember that you have to burn\n\n41:28.680 --> 41:31.600\n a lot of it per given time.\n\n41:31.600 --> 41:32.920\n So the burning is another problem.\n\n41:32.920 --> 41:34.640\n Which is a power question.\n\n41:34.640 --> 41:38.640\n Yes, and do you think just your intuition,\n\n41:38.640 --> 41:43.640\n there are breakthroughs in batteries on the horizon?\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:46.440\n How hard is that problem?\n\n41:46.440 --> 41:47.600\n Look, there are a lot of companies\n\n41:47.600 --> 41:52.600\n that are promising flying cars that are autonomous\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:55.120\n and that are clean.\n\n41:59.400 --> 42:01.680\n I think they're over promising.\n\n42:01.680 --> 42:04.800\n The autonomy piece is doable.\n\n42:04.800 --> 42:07.040\n The clean piece, I don't think so.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:11.840\n There's another company that I work with called JetOptra.\n\n42:11.840 --> 42:14.360\n They make small jet engines.\n\n42:15.760 --> 42:18.080\n And they can get up to 50 miles an hour very easily\n\n42:18.080 --> 42:19.960\n and lift 50 kilos.\n\n42:19.960 --> 42:22.840\n But they're jet engines, they're efficient,\n\n42:23.920 --> 42:26.320\n they're a little louder than electric vehicles,\n\n42:26.320 --> 42:28.960\n but they can build flying cars.\n\n42:28.960 --> 42:32.440\n So your sense is that there's a lot of pieces\n\n42:32.440 --> 42:33.520\n that have come together.\n\n42:33.520 --> 42:37.360\n So on this crazy question,\n\n42:37.360 --> 42:39.720\n if you look at companies like Kitty Hawk,\n\n42:39.720 --> 42:42.080\n working on electric, so the clean,\n\n42:43.880 --> 42:45.840\n talking to Sebastian Thrun, right?\n\n42:45.840 --> 42:48.840\n It's a crazy dream, you know?\n\n42:48.840 --> 42:52.080\n But you work with flight a lot.\n\n42:52.080 --> 42:55.760\n You've mentioned before that manned flights\n\n42:55.760 --> 43:00.760\n or carrying a human body is very difficult to do.\n\n43:01.640 --> 43:04.240\n So how crazy is flying cars?\n\n43:04.240 --> 43:05.400\n Do you think there'll be a day\n\n43:05.400 --> 43:10.400\n when we have vertical takeoff and landing vehicles\n\n43:11.080 --> 43:14.040\n that are sufficiently affordable\n\n43:14.960 --> 43:17.440\n that we're going to see a huge amount of them?\n\n43:17.440 --> 43:19.680\n And they would look like something like we dream of\n\n43:19.680 --> 43:21.080\n when we think about flying cars.\n\n43:21.080 --> 43:22.200\n Yeah, like the Jetsons.\n\n43:22.200 --> 43:23.160\n The Jetsons, yeah.\n\n43:23.160 --> 43:25.560\n So look, there are a lot of smart people working on this\n\n43:25.560 --> 43:29.640\n and you never say something is not possible\n\n43:29.640 --> 43:32.200\n when you have people like Sebastian Thrun working on it.\n\n43:32.200 --> 43:35.160\n So I totally think it's viable.\n\n43:35.160 --> 43:38.240\n I question, again, the electric piece.\n\n43:38.240 --> 43:39.520\n The electric piece, yeah.\n\n43:39.520 --> 43:41.680\n And again, for short distances, you can do it.\n\n43:41.680 --> 43:43.640\n And there's no reason to suggest\n\n43:43.640 --> 43:45.840\n that these all just have to be rotorcrafts.\n\n43:45.840 --> 43:46.920\n You take off vertically,\n\n43:46.920 --> 43:49.680\n but then you morph into a forward flight.\n\n43:49.680 --> 43:51.600\n I think there are a lot of interesting designs.\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:56.040\n The question to me is, are these economically viable?\n\n43:56.040 --> 43:59.160\n And if you agree to do this with fossil fuels,\n\n43:59.160 --> 44:01.960\n it instantly immediately becomes viable.\n\n44:01.960 --> 44:03.480\n That's a real challenge.\n\n44:03.480 --> 44:06.560\n Do you think it's possible for robots and humans\n\n44:06.560 --> 44:08.840\n to collaborate successfully on tasks?\n\n44:08.840 --> 44:13.640\n So a lot of robotics folks that I talk to and work with,\n\n44:13.640 --> 44:18.000\n I mean, humans just add a giant mess to the picture.\n\n44:18.000 --> 44:20.320\n So it's best to remove them from consideration\n\n44:20.320 --> 44:22.400\n when solving specific tasks.\n\n44:22.400 --> 44:23.600\n It's very difficult to model.\n\n44:23.600 --> 44:26.000\n There's just a source of uncertainty.\n\n44:26.000 --> 44:31.000\n In your work with these agile flying robots,\n\n44:32.560 --> 44:35.680\n do you think there's a role for collaboration with humans?\n\n44:35.680 --> 44:38.600\n Or is it best to model tasks in a way\n\n44:38.600 --> 44:43.400\n that doesn't have a human in the picture?\n\n44:43.400 --> 44:46.760\n Well, I don't think we should ever think about robots\n\n44:46.760 --> 44:48.120\n without human in the picture.\n\n44:48.120 --> 44:50.960\n Ultimately, robots are there because we want them\n\n44:50.960 --> 44:54.360\n to solve problems for humans.\n\n44:54.360 --> 44:58.280\n But there's no general solution to this problem.\n\n44:58.280 --> 45:00.000\n I think if you look at human interaction\n\n45:00.000 --> 45:02.400\n and how humans interact with robots,\n\n45:02.400 --> 45:05.280\n you know, we think of these in sort of three different ways.\n\n45:05.280 --> 45:07.600\n One is the human commanding the robot.\n\n45:08.880 --> 45:12.880\n The second is the human collaborating with the robot.\n\n45:12.880 --> 45:15.520\n So for example, we work on how a robot\n\n45:15.520 --> 45:18.720\n can actually pick up things with a human and carry things.\n\n45:18.720 --> 45:20.880\n That's like true collaboration.\n\n45:20.880 --> 45:25.000\n And third, we think about humans as bystanders,\n\n45:25.000 --> 45:27.240\n self driving cars, what's the human's role\n\n45:27.240 --> 45:30.320\n and how do self driving cars\n\n45:30.320 --> 45:32.920\n acknowledge the presence of humans?\n\n45:32.920 --> 45:35.840\n So I think all of these things are different scenarios.\n\n45:35.840 --> 45:38.480\n It depends on what kind of humans, what kind of task.\n\n45:39.640 --> 45:41.840\n And I think it's very difficult to say\n\n45:41.840 --> 45:45.520\n that there's a general theory that we all have for this.\n\n45:45.520 --> 45:48.440\n But at the same time, it's also silly to say\n\n45:48.440 --> 45:52.000\n that we should think about robots independent of humans.\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:55.760\n So to me, human robot interaction\n\n45:55.760 --> 45:59.760\n is almost a mandatory aspect of everything we do.\n\n45:59.760 --> 46:02.440\n Yes, but to which degree, so your thoughts,\n\n46:02.440 --> 46:05.240\n if we jump to autonomous vehicles, for example,\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:08.680\n there's a big debate between what's called\n\n46:08.680 --> 46:10.640\n level two and level four.\n\n46:10.640 --> 46:13.680\n So semi autonomous and autonomous vehicles.\n\n46:13.680 --> 46:16.440\n And so the Tesla approach currently at least\n\n46:16.440 --> 46:18.960\n has a lot of collaboration between human and machine.\n\n46:18.960 --> 46:22.040\n So the human is supposed to actively supervise\n\n46:22.040 --> 46:23.880\n the operation of the robot.\n\n46:23.880 --> 46:28.880\n Part of the safety definition of how safe a robot is\n\n46:29.160 --> 46:32.880\n in that case is how effective is the human in monitoring it.\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:37.880\n Do you think that's ultimately not a good approach\n\n46:37.880 --> 46:42.360\n in sort of having a human in the picture,\n\n46:42.360 --> 46:47.360\n not as a bystander or part of the infrastructure,\n\n46:47.400 --> 46:50.000\n but really as part of what's required\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:51.560\n to make the system safe?\n\n46:51.560 --> 46:53.720\n This is harder than it sounds.\n\n46:53.720 --> 46:58.200\n I think, you know, if you, I mean,\n\n46:58.200 --> 47:01.360\n I'm sure you've driven before in highways and so on.\n\n47:01.360 --> 47:06.120\n It's really very hard to have to relinquish control\n\n47:06.120 --> 47:10.440\n to a machine and then take over when needed.\n\n47:10.440 --> 47:12.280\n So I think Tesla's approach is interesting\n\n47:12.280 --> 47:14.800\n because it allows you to periodically establish\n\n47:14.800 --> 47:18.520\n some kind of contact with the car.\n\n47:18.520 --> 47:20.640\n Toyota, on the other hand, is thinking about\n\n47:20.640 --> 47:24.800\n shared autonomy or collaborative autonomy as a paradigm.\n\n47:24.800 --> 47:27.480\n If I may argue, these are very, very simple ways\n\n47:27.480 --> 47:29.680\n of human robot collaboration,\n\n47:29.680 --> 47:31.880\n because the task is pretty boring.\n\n47:31.880 --> 47:35.000\n You sit in a vehicle, you go from point A to point B.\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:37.360\n I think the more interesting thing to me is,\n\n47:37.360 --> 47:38.760\n for example, search and rescue.\n\n47:38.760 --> 47:41.980\n I've got a human first responder, robot first responders.\n\n47:43.160 --> 47:45.120\n I gotta do something.\n\n47:45.120 --> 47:46.000\n It's important.\n\n47:46.000 --> 47:47.800\n I have to do it in two minutes.\n\n47:47.800 --> 47:49.240\n The building is burning.\n\n47:49.240 --> 47:50.440\n There's been an explosion.\n\n47:50.440 --> 47:51.360\n It's collapsed.\n\n47:51.360 --> 47:52.800\n How do I do it?\n\n47:52.800 --> 47:54.740\n I think to me, those are the interesting things\n\n47:54.740 --> 47:57.160\n where it's very, very unstructured.\n\n47:57.160 --> 47:58.480\n And what's the role of the human?\n\n47:58.480 --> 48:00.200\n What's the role of the robot?\n\n48:00.200 --> 48:02.440\n Clearly, there's lots of interesting challenges\n\n48:02.440 --> 48:03.440\n and there's a field.\n\n48:03.440 --> 48:05.760\n I think we're gonna make a lot of progress in this area.\n\n48:05.760 --> 48:07.600\n Yeah, it's an exciting form of collaboration.\n\n48:07.600 --> 48:08.440\n You're right.\n\n48:08.440 --> 48:11.120\n In autonomous driving, the main enemy\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:13.120\n is just boredom of the human.\n\n48:13.120 --> 48:13.960\n Yes.\n\n48:13.960 --> 48:15.680\n As opposed to in rescue operations,\n\n48:15.680 --> 48:18.360\n it's literally life and death.\n\n48:18.360 --> 48:22.080\n And the collaboration enables\n\n48:22.080 --> 48:23.820\n the effective completion of the mission.\n\n48:23.820 --> 48:24.760\n So it's exciting.\n\n48:24.760 --> 48:27.400\n In some sense, we're also doing this.\n\n48:27.400 --> 48:30.520\n You think about the human driving a car\n\n48:30.520 --> 48:33.800\n and almost invariably, the human's trying\n\n48:33.800 --> 48:35.000\n to estimate the state of the car,\n\n48:35.000 --> 48:37.280\n they estimate the state of the environment and so on.\n\n48:37.280 --> 48:40.120\n But what if the car were to estimate the state of the human?\n\n48:40.120 --> 48:41.960\n So for example, I'm sure you have a smartphone\n\n48:41.960 --> 48:44.580\n and the smartphone tries to figure out what you're doing\n\n48:44.580 --> 48:48.320\n and send you reminders and oftentimes telling you\n\n48:48.320 --> 48:49.540\n to drive to a certain place,\n\n48:49.540 --> 48:51.400\n although you have no intention of going there\n\n48:51.400 --> 48:53.880\n because it thinks that that's where you should be\n\n48:53.880 --> 48:56.240\n because of some Gmail calendar entry\n\n48:57.520 --> 48:58.960\n or something like that.\n\n48:58.960 --> 49:01.600\n And it's trying to constantly figure out who you are,\n\n49:01.600 --> 49:02.740\n what you're doing.\n\n49:02.740 --> 49:04.200\n If a car were to do that,\n\n49:04.200 --> 49:06.840\n maybe that would make the driver safer\n\n49:06.840 --> 49:08.160\n because the car is trying to figure out\n\n49:08.160 --> 49:09.760\n is the driver paying attention,\n\n49:09.760 --> 49:11.600\n looking at his or her eyes,\n\n49:12.480 --> 49:14.400\n looking at circadian movements.\n\n49:14.400 --> 49:16.480\n So I think the potential is there,\n\n49:16.480 --> 49:18.600\n but from the reverse side,\n\n49:18.600 --> 49:21.640\n it's not robot modeling, but it's human modeling.\n\n49:21.640 --> 49:22.880\n It's more on the human, right.\n\n49:22.880 --> 49:25.320\n And I think the robots can do a very good job\n\n49:25.320 --> 49:29.120\n of modeling humans if you really think about the framework\n\n49:29.120 --> 49:32.640\n that you have a human sitting in a cockpit,\n\n49:32.640 --> 49:35.820\n surrounded by sensors, all staring at him,\n\n49:35.820 --> 49:37.860\n in addition to be staring outside,\n\n49:37.860 --> 49:39.160\n but also staring at him.\n\n49:39.160 --> 49:40.960\n I think there's a real synergy there.\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:42.360\n Yeah, I love that problem\n\n49:42.360 --> 49:45.560\n because it's the new 21st century form of psychology,\n\n49:45.560 --> 49:48.520\n actually AI enabled psychology.\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:51.280\n A lot of people have sci fi inspired fears\n\n49:51.280 --> 49:54.080\n of walking robots like those from Boston Dynamics.\n\n49:54.080 --> 49:56.480\n If you just look at shows on Netflix and so on,\n\n49:56.480 --> 49:59.040\n or flying robots like those you work with,\n\n49:59.920 --> 50:03.160\n how would you, how do you think about those fears?\n\n50:03.160 --> 50:05.040\n How would you alleviate those fears?\n\n50:05.040 --> 50:09.040\n Do you have inklings, echoes of those same concerns?\n\n50:09.040 --> 50:11.760\n You know, anytime we develop a technology\n\n50:11.760 --> 50:14.160\n meaning to have positive impact in the world,\n\n50:14.160 --> 50:15.780\n there's always the worry that,\n\n50:17.440 --> 50:21.000\n you know, somebody could subvert those technologies\n\n50:21.000 --> 50:23.280\n and use it in an adversarial setting.\n\n50:23.280 --> 50:25.280\n And robotics is no exception, right?\n\n50:25.280 --> 50:29.280\n So I think it's very easy to weaponize robots.\n\n50:29.280 --> 50:30.880\n I think we talk about swarms.\n\n50:31.720 --> 50:33.960\n One thing I worry a lot about is,\n\n50:33.960 --> 50:35.880\n so, you know, for us to get swarms to work\n\n50:35.880 --> 50:38.280\n and do something reliably, it's really hard.\n\n50:38.280 --> 50:42.040\n But suppose I have this challenge\n\n50:42.040 --> 50:44.360\n of trying to destroy something,\n\n50:44.360 --> 50:45.720\n and I have a swarm of robots,\n\n50:45.720 --> 50:47.280\n where only one out of the swarm\n\n50:47.280 --> 50:48.920\n needs to get to its destination.\n\n50:48.920 --> 50:52.640\n So that suddenly becomes a lot more doable.\n\n50:52.640 --> 50:54.720\n And so I worry about, you know,\n\n50:54.720 --> 50:56.920\n this general idea of using autonomy\n\n50:56.920 --> 50:58.600\n with lots and lots of agents.\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:01.320\n I mean, having said that, look,\n\n51:01.320 --> 51:03.760\n a lot of this technology is not very mature.\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:05.520\n My favorite saying is that\n\n51:06.560 --> 51:10.520\n if somebody had to develop this technology,\n\n51:10.520 --> 51:12.320\n wouldn't you rather the good guys do it?\n\n51:12.320 --> 51:13.880\n So the good guys have a good understanding\n\n51:13.880 --> 51:15.560\n of the technology, so they can figure out\n\n51:15.560 --> 51:18.320\n how this technology is being used in a bad way,\n\n51:18.320 --> 51:21.360\n or could be used in a bad way and try to defend against it.\n\n51:21.360 --> 51:22.760\n So we think a lot about that.\n\n51:22.760 --> 51:25.400\n So we have, we're doing research\n\n51:25.400 --> 51:28.240\n on how to defend against swarms, for example.\n\n51:28.240 --> 51:29.600\n That's interesting.\n\n51:29.600 --> 51:32.960\n There's in fact a report by the National Academies\n\n51:32.960 --> 51:35.520\n on counter UAS technologies.\n\n51:36.680 --> 51:38.200\n This is a real threat,\n\n51:38.200 --> 51:40.320\n but we're also thinking about how to defend against this\n\n51:40.320 --> 51:42.920\n and knowing how swarms work.\n\n51:42.920 --> 51:47.160\n Knowing how autonomy works is, I think, very important.\n\n51:47.160 --> 51:49.280\n So it's not just politicians?\n\n51:49.280 --> 51:51.640\n Do you think engineers have a role in this discussion?\n\n51:51.640 --> 51:52.480\n Absolutely.\n\n51:52.480 --> 51:55.280\n I think the days where politicians\n\n51:55.280 --> 51:57.680\n can be agnostic to technology are gone.\n\n51:59.200 --> 52:02.640\n I think every politician needs to be\n\n52:03.840 --> 52:05.680\n literate in technology.\n\n52:05.680 --> 52:08.640\n And I often say technology is the new liberal art.\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:12.920\n Understanding how technology will change your life,\n\n52:12.920 --> 52:14.480\n I think is important.\n\n52:14.480 --> 52:18.080\n And every human being needs to understand that.\n\n52:18.080 --> 52:20.160\n And maybe we can elect some engineers\n\n52:20.160 --> 52:22.720\n to office as well on the other side.\n\n52:22.720 --> 52:24.840\n What are the biggest open problems in robotics?\n\n52:24.840 --> 52:27.760\n And you said we're in the early days in some sense.\n\n52:27.760 --> 52:31.040\n What are the problems we would like to solve in robotics?\n\n52:31.040 --> 52:32.520\n I think there are lots of problems, right?\n\n52:32.520 --> 52:36.440\n But I would phrase it in the following way.\n\n52:36.440 --> 52:39.520\n If you look at the robots we're building,\n\n52:39.520 --> 52:43.160\n they're still very much tailored towards\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:46.520\n doing specific tasks and specific settings.\n\n52:46.520 --> 52:49.480\n I think the question of how do you get them to operate\n\n52:49.480 --> 52:51.080\n in much broader settings\n\n52:53.560 --> 52:58.040\n where things can change in unstructured environments\n\n52:58.040 --> 52:59.160\n is up in the air.\n\n52:59.160 --> 53:01.200\n So think of self driving cars.\n\n53:02.920 --> 53:05.680\n Today, we can build a self driving car in a parking lot.\n\n53:05.680 --> 53:09.000\n We can do level five autonomy in a parking lot.\n\n53:10.040 --> 53:13.240\n But can you do a level five autonomy\n\n53:13.240 --> 53:16.840\n in the streets of Napoli in Italy or Mumbai in India?\n\n53:16.840 --> 53:17.760\n No.\n\n53:17.760 --> 53:22.400\n So in some sense, when we think about robotics,\n\n53:22.400 --> 53:25.120\n we have to think about where they're functioning,\n\n53:25.120 --> 53:27.760\n what kind of environment, what kind of a task.\n\n53:27.760 --> 53:29.800\n We have no understanding\n\n53:29.800 --> 53:32.800\n of how to put both those things together.\n\n53:32.800 --> 53:34.000\n So we're in the very early days\n\n53:34.000 --> 53:35.920\n of applying it to the physical world.\n\n53:35.920 --> 53:38.800\n And I was just in Naples actually.\n\n53:38.800 --> 53:42.200\n And there's levels of difficulty and complexity\n\n53:42.200 --> 53:45.880\n depending on which area you're applying it to.\n\n53:45.880 --> 53:46.720\n I think so.\n\n53:46.720 --> 53:49.320\n And we don't have a systematic way of understanding that.\n\n53:51.040 --> 53:53.800\n Everybody says, just because a computer\n\n53:53.800 --> 53:56.520\n can now beat a human at any board game,\n\n53:56.520 --> 53:59.920\n we certainly know something about intelligence.\n\n53:59.920 --> 54:01.360\n That's not true.\n\n54:01.360 --> 54:04.400\n A computer board game is very, very structured.\n\n54:04.400 --> 54:08.480\n It is the equivalent of working in a Henry Ford factory\n\n54:08.480 --> 54:11.680\n where things, parts come, you assemble, move on.\n\n54:11.680 --> 54:14.120\n It's a very, very, very structured setting.\n\n54:14.120 --> 54:15.680\n That's the easiest thing.\n\n54:15.680 --> 54:17.040\n And we know how to do that.\n\n54:18.400 --> 54:20.400\n So you've done a lot of incredible work\n\n54:20.400 --> 54:23.720\n at the UPenn, University of Pennsylvania, GraspLab.\n\n54:23.720 --> 54:26.560\n You're now Dean of Engineering at UPenn.\n\n54:26.560 --> 54:31.320\n What advice do you have for a new bright eyed undergrad\n\n54:31.320 --> 54:34.640\n interested in robotics or AI or engineering?\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:36.560\n Well, I think there's really three things.\n\n54:36.560 --> 54:40.600\n One is you have to get used to the idea\n\n54:40.600 --> 54:42.840\n that the world will not be the same in five years\n\n54:42.840 --> 54:45.160\n or four years whenever you graduate, right?\n\n54:45.160 --> 54:46.120\n Which is really hard to do.\n\n54:46.120 --> 54:48.960\n So this thing about predicting the future,\n\n54:48.960 --> 54:50.520\n every one of us needs to be trying\n\n54:50.520 --> 54:52.360\n to predict the future always.\n\n54:53.280 --> 54:54.960\n Not because you'll be any good at it,\n\n54:54.960 --> 54:56.440\n but by thinking about it,\n\n54:56.440 --> 55:00.880\n I think you sharpen your senses and you become smarter.\n\n55:00.880 --> 55:02.080\n So that's number one.\n\n55:02.080 --> 55:05.760\n Number two, it's a corollary of the first piece,\n\n55:05.760 --> 55:09.360\n which is you really don't know what's gonna be important.\n\n55:09.360 --> 55:12.080\n So this idea that I'm gonna specialize in something\n\n55:12.080 --> 55:15.320\n which will allow me to go in a particular direction,\n\n55:15.320 --> 55:16.480\n it may be interesting,\n\n55:16.480 --> 55:18.480\n but it's important also to have this breadth\n\n55:18.480 --> 55:20.360\n so you have this jumping off point.\n\n55:22.000 --> 55:23.000\n I think the third thing,\n\n55:23.000 --> 55:25.360\n and this is where I think Penn excels.\n\n55:25.360 --> 55:27.240\n I mean, we teach engineering,\n\n55:27.240 --> 55:29.960\n but it's always in the context of the liberal arts.\n\n55:29.960 --> 55:32.360\n It's always in the context of society.\n\n55:32.360 --> 55:35.840\n As engineers, we cannot afford to lose sight of that.\n\n55:35.840 --> 55:37.640\n So I think that's important.\n\n55:37.640 --> 55:39.960\n But I think one thing that people underestimate\n\n55:39.960 --> 55:40.920\n when they do robotics\n\n55:40.920 --> 55:43.440\n is the importance of mathematical foundations,\n\n55:43.440 --> 55:46.880\n the importance of representations.\n\n55:47.720 --> 55:50.040\n Not everything can just be solved\n\n55:50.040 --> 55:52.440\n by looking for Ross packages on the internet\n\n55:52.440 --> 55:56.280\n or to find a deep neural network that works.\n\n55:56.280 --> 55:59.080\n I think the representation question is key,\n\n55:59.080 --> 56:00.400\n even to machine learning,\n\n56:00.400 --> 56:05.400\n where if you ever hope to achieve or get to explainable AI,\n\n56:05.400 --> 56:07.760\n somehow there need to be representations\n\n56:07.760 --> 56:09.080\n that you can understand.\n\n56:09.080 --> 56:11.120\n So if you wanna do robotics,\n\n56:11.120 --> 56:12.680\n you should also do mathematics.\n\n56:12.680 --> 56:15.080\n And you said liberal arts, a little literature.\n\n56:16.160 --> 56:17.200\n If you wanna build a robot,\n\n56:17.200 --> 56:19.320\n it should be reading Dostoyevsky.\n\n56:19.320 --> 56:20.360\n I agree with that.\n\n56:20.360 --> 56:21.200\n Very good.\n\n56:21.200 --> 56:23.560\n So Vijay, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n56:23.560 --> 56:24.400\n It was an honor.\n\n56:24.400 --> 56:25.240\n Thank you.\n\n56:25.240 --> 56:26.200\n It was just a very exciting conversation.\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:46.200\n Thank you.\n\n"
