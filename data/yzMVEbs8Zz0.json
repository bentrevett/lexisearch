Dean of the College of Computing\n\n00:06.280 --> 00:09.600\n at Georgia Tech and Michael is a computer science professor\n\n00:09.600 --> 00:10.840\n at Brown University.\n\n00:10.840 --> 00:14.880\n I've spoken with each of them individually on this podcast\n\n00:14.880 --> 00:17.360\n and since they are good friends in real life,\n\n00:17.360 --> 00:19.160\n we all thought it would be fun\n\n00:19.160 --> 00:21.760\n to have a conversation together.\n\n00:21.760 --> 00:23.400\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n00:23.400 --> 00:26.040\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:26.040 --> 00:28.440\n Thank you to Athletic Greens,\n\n00:28.440 --> 00:30.920\n the all in one drink that I start every day with\n\n00:30.920 --> 00:33.240\n to cover all my nutritional bases.\n\n00:33.240 --> 00:35.960\n Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself\n\n00:35.960 --> 00:38.920\n and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.\n\n00:38.920 --> 00:40.760\n Masterclass, online courses\n\n00:40.760 --> 00:43.640\n from some of the most amazing humans in history\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:47.460\n and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n00:47.460 --> 00:49.840\n Please check out the sponsors in the description\n\n00:49.840 --> 00:53.020\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n00:53.020 --> 00:55.800\n As a side note, let me say that having two guests\n\n00:55.800 --> 00:57.800\n on the podcast is an experiment\n\n00:57.800 --> 01:00.040\n that I've been meaning to do for a while.\n\n01:00.040 --> 01:02.580\n In particular, because down the road,\n\n01:02.580 --> 01:05.680\n I would like to occasionally be a kind of moderator\n\n01:05.680 --> 01:09.120\n for debates between people that may disagree\n\n01:09.120 --> 01:10.720\n in some interesting ways.\n\n01:10.720 --> 01:13.780\n If you have suggestions for who you would like to see debate\n\n01:13.780 --> 01:16.220\n on this podcast, let me know.\n\n01:16.220 --> 01:18.620\n As with all experiments of this kind,\n\n01:18.620 --> 01:20.600\n it is a learning process.\n\n01:20.600 --> 01:23.720\n Both the video and the audio might need improvement.\n\n01:23.720 --> 01:25.800\n I realized I think I should probably do\n\n01:25.800 --> 01:27.400\n three or more cameras next time\n\n01:27.400 --> 01:28.960\n as opposed to just two.\n\n01:28.960 --> 01:31.720\n And also try different ways to mount the microphone\n\n01:31.720 --> 01:34.680\n for the third person.\n\n01:34.680 --> 01:36.900\n Also, after recording this intro,\n\n01:36.900 --> 01:40.200\n I'm going to have to go figure out the thumbnail\n\n01:40.200 --> 01:42.140\n for the video version of the podcast\n\n01:42.140 --> 01:45.680\n since I usually put the guest's head on the thumbnail.\n\n01:45.680 --> 01:49.800\n And now there's two heads and two names\n\n01:49.800 --> 01:52.540\n to try to fit into the thumbnail.\n\n01:52.540 --> 01:55.160\n It's a kind of a bin packing problem\n\n01:55.160 --> 01:58.420\n which in theoretical computer science\n\n01:58.420 --> 02:02.320\n happens to be an NP hard problem.\n\n02:02.320 --> 02:04.720\n Whatever I come up with, if you have better ideas\n\n02:04.720 --> 02:06.760\n for the thumbnail, let me know as well.\n\n02:06.760 --> 02:08.680\n And in general, I always welcome ideas\n\n02:08.680 --> 02:10.360\n how this thing can be improved.\n\n02:10.360 --> 02:12.680\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:12.680 --> 02:15.040\n review it with Five Stars and Apple Podcast,\n\n02:15.040

Charles Isbell\n\n02:24.880 --> 02:26.260\n and Michael Littman.\n\n02:27.220 --> 02:30.360\n You'll probably disagree about this question,\n\n02:30.360 --> 02:33.560\n but what is your biggest, would you say, disagreement\n\n02:33.560 --> 02:37.200\n about either something profound and very important\n\n02:37.200 --> 02:39.760\n or something completely not important at all?\n\n02:39.760 --> 02:42.080\n I don't think we have any disagreements at all.\n\n02:42.080 --> 02:44.280\n I'm not sure that's true.\n\n02:44.280 --> 02:45.680\n We walked into that one, didn't we?\n\n02:45.680 --> 02:48.840\n So one thing that you sometimes mention is that,\n\n02:48.840 --> 02:51.920\n and we did this one on air too, as it were,\n\n02:51.920 --> 02:52.960\n whether or not machine learning\n\n02:52.960 --> 02:55.280\n is computational statistics.\n\n02:55.280 --> 02:56.120\n It's not.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:57.840\n But it is.\n\n02:57.840 --> 02:58.680\n Well, it's not.\n\n02:58.680 --> 03:00.520\n And in particular, and more importantly,\n\n03:00.520 --> 03:02.820\n it is not just computational statistics.\n\n03:02.820 --> 03:04.520\n So what's missing in the picture?\n\n03:04.520 --> 03:05.520\n All the rest of it.\n\n03:05.520 --> 03:07.560\n What's missing?\n\n03:07.560 --> 03:08.520\n That which is missing.\n\n03:08.520 --> 03:10.360\n Oh, yes, well, you can't be wrong now.\n\n03:10.360 --> 03:11.560\n Well, it's not just the statistics.\n\n03:11.560 --> 03:12.700\n He doesn't even believe this.\n\n03:12.700 --> 03:14.260\n We've had this conversation before.\n\n03:14.260 --> 03:15.720\n If it were just the statistics,\n\n03:15.720 --> 03:18.920\n then we would be happy with where we are.\n\n03:18.920 --> 03:19.760\n But it's not just the statistics.\n\n03:19.760 --> 03:21.440\n That's why it's computational statistics.\n\n03:21.440 --> 03:22.720\n Or if it were just the computational.\n\n03:22.720 --> 03:24.720\n I agree that machine learning is not just statistics.\n\n03:24.720 --> 03:25.560\n It is not just statistics.\n\n03:25.560 --> 03:26.440\n We can agree on that.\n\n03:26.440 --> 03:28.040\n Nor is it just computational statistics.\n\n03:28.040 --> 03:29.360\n It's computational statistics.\n\n03:29.360 --> 03:30.180\n It is computational.\n\n03:30.180 --> 03:33.100\n What is the computational and computational statistics?\n\n03:33.100 --> 03:35.120\n Does this take us into the realm of computing?\n\n03:35.120 --> 03:37.800\n It does, but I think perhaps the way I can get him\n\n03:37.800 --> 03:42.800\n to admit that he's wrong is that it's about rules.\n\n03:43.280 --> 03:44.160\n It's about rules.\n\n03:44.160 --> 03:45.040\n It's about symbols.\n\n03:45.040 --> 03:45.880\n It's about all these other things.\n\n03:45.880 --> 03:47.520\n But statistics is not about rules?\n\n03:47.520 --> 03:48.920\n I'm gonna say statistics is about rules.\n\n03:48.920 --> 03:50.160\n But it's not just the statistics, right?\n\n03:50.160 --> 03:51.840\n It's not just a random variable that you choose\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:52.680\n and you have a probability.\n\n03:52.680 --> 03:54.520\n I think you have a narrow view of statistics.\n\n03:54.520 --> 03:56.960\n Okay, well then what would be the broad view of statistics\n\n03:56.960 --> 03:58.440\n that would still allow it to be statistics\n\n03:58.440 --> 04:01.360\n and not say history that would make\n\n04:01.360 --> 04:03.000\n computational statistics okay?\n\n04:03.000 --> 04:07.200\n Well, okay, so I had my first sort of research mentor,\n\n04:07.200 --> 04:08.600\n a guy named Tom Landauer,\n\n04:09.500 --> 04:12.400\n taught me to do some statistics, right?\n\n04:12.400 --> 04:14.940\n And I was annoyed all the time\n\n04:14.940 --> 04:16.080\n because the statistics would say\n\n04:16.080 --> 04:19.280\n that what I was doing was not statistically significant.\n\n04:19.280 --> 04:23.360\n And I was like, but, but, and basically what he said to me\n\n04:23.360 --> 04:25.120\n is statistics is how you're gonna keep\n\n04:25.120 --> 04:29.640\n from lying to yourself, which I thought was really deep.\n\n04:29.640 --> 04:33.280\n It is a way to keep yourself honest in a particular way.\n\n04:33.280 --> 04:34.120\n I agree with that.\n\n04:34.120 --> 04:36.960\n Yeah, and so you're trying to find rules.\n\n04:36.960 --> 04:38.600\n I'm just gonna bring it back to rules.\n\n04:38.600 --> 04:43.600\n Wait, wait, wait, could you possibly try to define rules?\n\n04:44.000 --> 04:47.680\n Even regular statisticians, noncomputational statisticians,\n\n04:47.680 --> 04:51.200\n do spend some of their time evaluating rules, right?\n\n04:51.200 --> 04:52.760\n Applying statistics to try to understand\n\n04:52.760 --> 04:54.760\n does this rule capture this?\n\n04:54.760 --> 04:55.600\n Does this not capture that?\n\n04:55.600 --> 04:57.560\n You mean like hypothesis testing kind of thing?\n\n04:57.560 --> 04:59.360\n Or like confidence intervals?\n\n04:59.360 --> 05:01.600\n I think more like hypothesis.\n\n05:01.600 --> 05:03.080\n Like I feel like the word statistic\n\n05:03.080 --> 05:04.680\n literally means like a summary,\n\n05:04.680 --> 05:06.880\n like a number that summarizes other numbers.\n\n05:06.880 --> 05:08.280\n But I think the field of statistics\n\n05:08.280 --> 05:11.420\n actually applies that idea to things like rules,\n\n05:11.420 --> 05:15.320\n to understand whether or not a rule is valid.\n\n05:15.320 --> 05:18.160\n Does software engineering statistics?\n\n05:18.160 --> 05:19.000\n No.\n\n05:19.000 --> 05:20.820\n Programming languages statistics?\n\n05:20.820 --> 05:21.660\n No.\n\n05:21.660 --> 05:22.480\n Because I think there's a very,\n\n05:22.480 --> 05:24.640\n it's useful to think about a lot of what AI\n\n05:24.640 --> 05:26.520\n and machine learning is or certainly should be\n\n05:26.520 --> 05:29.520\n as software engineering, as programming languages.\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:33.480\n Just to put it in language that you might understand,\n\n05:33.480 --> 05:35.680\n the hyperparameters beyond the problem itself.\n\n05:35.680 --> 05:37.000\n The hyperparameters is too many syllables\n\n05:37.000 --> 05:37.840\n for me to understand.\n\n05:37.840 --> 05:39.720\n The hyperparameters.\n\n05:39.720 --> 05:40.560\n That's better.\n\n05:40.560 --> 05:41.380\n That goes around it, right?\n\n05:41.380 --> 05:42.840\n It's the decisions you choose to make.\n\n05:42.840 --> 05:44.880\n It's the metrics you choose to use.\n\n05:44.880 --> 05:45.720\n It's the loss function.\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:48.160\n You wanna say the practice of machine learning\n\n05:48.160 --> 05:50.080\n is different than the practice of statistics.\n\n05:50.080 --> 05:51.560\n Like the things you have to worry about\n\n05:51.560 --> 05:53.480\n and how you worry about them are different,\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:54.640\n therefore they're different.\n\n05:54.640 --> 05:55.560\n Right.\n\n05:55.560 --> 05:57.920\n At a very little, I mean, at the very least.\n\n05:57.920 --> 05:59.080\n It's that much is true.\n\n05:59.080 --> 06:00.280\n It doesn't mean that statistics,\n\n06:00.280 --> 06:02.400\n computational or otherwise aren't important.\n\n06:02.400 --> 06:03.240\n I think they are.\n\n06:03.240 --> 06:05.680\n I mean, I do a lot of that, for example.\n\n06:05.680 --> 06:06.920\n But I think it goes beyond that.\n\n06:06.920 --> 06:09.200\n I think that we could think about game theory\n\n06:09.200 --> 06:10.100\n in terms of statistics,\n\n06:10.100 --> 06:12.600\n but I don't think it's very as useful to do.\n\n06:12.600 --> 06:14.040\n I mean, the way I would think about it\n\n06:14.040 --> 06:17.380\n or a way I would think about it is this way.\n\n06:17.380 --> 06:19.020\n Chemistry is just physics.\n\n06:19.980 --> 06:22.180\n But I don't think it's as useful to think about chemistry\n\n06:22.180 --> 06:23.320\n as being just physics.\n\n06:23.320 --> 06:25.560\n It's useful to think about it as chemistry.\n\n06:25.560 --> 06:27.180\n The level of abstraction really matters here.\n\n06:27.180 --> 06:28.520\n So I think it is,\n\n06:28.520 --> 06:30.420\n there are contexts in which it is useful.\n\n06:30.420 --> 06:31.260\n Yes.\n\n06:31.260 --> 06:32.080\n I think of it that way, right?\n\n06:32.080 --> 06:33.160\n So finding that connection is actually helpful.\n\n06:33.160 --> 06:34.760\n And I think that's when I emphasize\n\n06:34.760 --> 06:36.120\n the computational statistics thing.\n\n06:36.120 --> 06:41.120\n I think I want to befriend statistics and not absorb them.\n\n06:41.120 --> 06:43.760\n Here's the A way to think about it\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:44.800\n beyond what I just said, right?\n\n06:44.800 --> 06:47.200\n So what would you say,\n\n06:47.200 --> 06:48.440\n and I want you to think back to a conversation\n\n06:48.440 --> 06:49.520\n we had a very long time ago.\n\n06:49.520 --> 06:52.120\n What would you say is the difference between,\n\n06:52.120 --> 06:54.560\n say, the early 2000s, ICML\n\n06:54.560 --> 06:57.240\n and what we used to call NIPS, NeurIPS?\n\n06:57.240 --> 06:58.400\n Is there a difference?\n\n06:58.400 --> 06:59.960\n A lot of, particularly on the machine learning\n\n06:59.960 --> 07:00.960\n that was done there?\n\n07:00.960 --> 07:02.960\n ICML was around that long.\n\n07:02.960 --> 07:03.800\n Oh, yeah.\n\n07:03.800 --> 07:06.880\n So iClear is the new conference, newish.\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:07.720\n Yeah, I guess so.\n\n07:07.720 --> 07:10.120\n And ICML was around the 2000.\n\n07:10.120 --> 07:12.280\n So ICML predates that.\n\n07:12.280 --> 07:15.520\n I think my most cited ICML paper is from 94.\n\n07:15.520 --> 07:16.480\n Michael knows this better than me\n\n07:16.480 --> 07:18.000\n because, of course, he's significantly older than I am.\n\n07:18.000 --> 07:20.600\n But the point is, what is the difference\n\n07:20.600 --> 07:24.440\n between ICML and NeurIPS in the late 90s, early 2000s?\n\n07:24.440 --> 07:26.500\n I don't know what everyone else's perspective would be,\n\n07:26.500 --> 07:28.920\n but I had a particular perspective at that time,\n\n07:28.920 --> 07:31.120\n which is I felt like ICML was more\n\n07:31.120 --> 07:33.560\n of a computer science place\n\n07:33.560 --> 07:37.140\n and that NIPS, NeurIPS was more of an engineering place,\n\n07:37.140 --> 07:40.560\n like the kind of math that happened at the two places.\n\n07:40.560 --> 07:41.520\n As a computer scientist,\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:44.480\n I felt more comfortable with the ICML math.\n\n07:44.480 --> 07:46.520\n And the NeurIPS people would say\n\n07:46.520 --> 07:48.880\n that that's because I'm dumb.\n\n07:48.880 --> 07:51.720\n And that's such an engineering thing to say, so.\n\n07:51.720 --> 07:52.560\n I agree with that part of it,\n\n07:52.560 --> 07:53.400\n but I do it a little differently.\n\n07:53.400 --> 07:54.760\n We actually had a nice conversation\n\n07:54.760 --> 07:57.320\n with Tom Dietrich about this in public.\n\n07:57.320 --> 07:58.560\n On Twitter just a couple of days ago.\n\n07:58.560 --> 07:59.520\n I put it a little differently,\n\n07:59.520 --> 08:02.360\n which is that ICML was machine learning done\n\n08:02.360 --> 08:04.600\n by a computer scientist.\n\n08:04.600 --> 08:07.960\n And NeurIPS was machine learning done\n\n08:07.960 --> 08:10.920\n by a computer scientist trying to impress statisticians.\n\n08:12.920 --> 08:15.080\n Which was weird because it was the same people,\n\n08:15.080 --> 08:17.260\n at least by the time I started paying attention.\n\n08:17.260 --> 08:18.940\n But it just felt very, very different.\n\n08:18.940 --> 08:20.960\n And I think that that perspective\n\n08:20.960 --> 08:22.760\n of whether you're trying to impress the statisticians\n\n08:22.760 --> 08:24.300\n or you're trying to impress the programmers\n\n08:24.300 --> 08:26.720\n is actually very different and has real impact\n\n08:26.720 --> 08:29.600\n on what you choose to worry about\n\n08:29.600 --> 08:31.440\n and what kind of outcomes you come to.\n\n08:31.440 --> 08:32.680\n So I think it really matters.\n\n08:32.680 --> 08:34.480\n I think computational statistics is a means to an end.\n\n08:34.480 --> 08:36.080\n It is not an end in some sense.\n\n08:36.980 --> 08:39.120\n And I think that really matters here\n\n08:39.120 --> 08:40.760\n in the same way that I don't think computer science\n\n08:40.760 --> 08:42.120\n is just engineering or just science\n\n08:42.120 --> 08:43.160\n or just math or whatever.\n\n08:43.160 --> 08:44.880\n Okay, so I'd have to now agree\n\n08:44.880 --> 08:46.280\n that now we agree on everything.\n\n08:46.280 --> 08:47.780\n Yes, yes.\n\n08:47.780 --> 08:49.280\n The important thing here is that\n\n08:50.560 --> 08:51.760\n my opinions may have changed,\n\n08:51.760 --> 08:53.000\n but not the fact that I'm right,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:54.600\n I think is what we just came to.\n\n08:54.600 --> 08:55.920\n Right, and my opinions may have changed\n\n08:55.920 --> 08:57.380\n and not the fact that I'm wrong.\n\n08:57.380 --> 08:58.220\n That's right.\n\n08:59.120 --> 08:59.960\n You lost me.\n\n08:59.960 --> 09:00.780\n I'm not even.\n\n09:00.780 --> 09:01.760\n I think I lost myself there too.\n\n09:01.760 --> 09:04.320\n But anyway, we're back.\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:05.440\n This happens to us sometimes.\n\n09:05.440 --> 09:06.280\n We're sorry.\n\n09:06.280 --> 09:08.840\n How does neural networks change this,\n\n09:08.840 --> 09:11.120\n just to even linger on this topic,\n\n09:11.120 --> 09:14.680\n change this idea of statistics,\n\n09:15.600 --> 09:17.720\n how big of a pie statistics is\n\n09:17.720 --> 09:19.220\n within the machine learning thing?\n\n09:19.220 --> 09:22.000\n Like, because it sounds like hyperparameters\n\n09:22.000 --> 09:24.280\n and also just the role of data.\n\n09:24.280 --> 09:25.920\n You know, people are starting to use\n\n09:25.920 --> 09:28.440\n this terminology of software 2.0,\n\n09:28.440 --> 09:31.140\n which is like the act of programming\n\n09:31.140 --> 09:35.800\n as a, like you're a designer\n\n09:35.800 --> 09:38.240\n in the hyperparameter space of neural networks,\n\n09:38.240 --> 09:40.760\n and you're also the collector and the organizer\n\n09:40.760 --> 09:44.080\n and the cleaner of the data,\n\n09:44.080 --> 09:45.900\n and that's part of the programming.\n\n09:47.040 --> 09:52.040\n So how did, on the NeurIPS versus ICML topic,\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:54.000\n what's the role of neural networks\n\n09:54.000 --> 09:57.320\n in redefining the size and the role of machine learning?\n\n09:57.320 --> 10:00.120\n I can't wait to hear what Michael thinks about this,\n\n10:00.120 --> 10:01.280\n but I would add one.\n\n10:01.280 --> 10:02.120\n But you will.\n\n10:02.120 --> 10:04.320\n That's true, I will, I'll force myself to.\n\n10:04.320 --> 10:06.320\n I think there's one other thing\n\n10:06.320 --> 10:07.400\n I would add to your description,\n\n10:07.400 --> 10:09.120\n which is the kind of software engineering part\n\n10:09.120 --> 10:10.920\n of what does it mean to debug, for example.\n\n10:10.920 --> 10:13.080\n But this is a difference between\n\n10:13.080 --> 10:14.800\n the kind of computational statistics view\n\n10:14.800 --> 10:16.840\n of machine learning and the computational view\n\n10:16.840 --> 10:18.600\n of machine learning, which is, I think,\n\n10:18.600 --> 10:20.800\n one is worried about the equation, as it were.\n\n10:20.800 --> 10:23.120\n And by the way, this is not a value judgment.\n\n10:23.120 --> 10:24.960\n I just think it's about perspective.\n\n10:24.960 --> 10:26.440\n But the kind of questions you would ask\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:27.320\n when you start asking yourself,\n\n10:27.320 --> 10:28.320\n well, what does it mean to program\n\n10:28.320 --> 10:29.720\n and develop and build the system,\n\n10:29.720 --> 10:33.080\n is a very computer sciencey view of the problem.\n\n10:33.080 --> 10:35.960\n I mean, if you get on data science Twitter\n\n10:35.960 --> 10:39.620\n and econ Twitter, you actually hear this a lot\n\n10:39.620 --> 10:43.000\n with the economist and the data scientist\n\n10:43.000 --> 10:44.600\n complaining about the machine learning people.\n\n10:44.600 --> 10:46.280\n Well, it's just statistics,\n\n10:46.280 --> 10:47.800\n and I don't know why they don't see this.\n\n10:47.800 --> 10:49.360\n But they're not even asking the same questions.\n\n10:49.360 --> 10:50.780\n They're not thinking about it\n\n10:50.780 --> 10:53.160\n as a kind of programming problem.\n\n10:53.160 --> 10:54.620\n And I think that that really matters,\n\n10:54.620 --> 10:55.980\n just asking this question.\n\n10:55.980 --> 10:57.020\n I actually think it's a little different\n\n10:57.020 --> 11:00.640\n from programming in hyperparameter space\n\n11:00.640 --> 11:03.120\n and sort of collecting the data.\n\n11:03.120 --> 11:06.040\n But I do think that that immersion really matters.\n\n11:06.040 --> 11:07.920\n So I'll give you a quick example\n\n11:07.920 --> 11:08.760\n of the way I think about this.\n\n11:08.760 --> 11:09.840\n So I teach machine learning.\n\n11:09.840 --> 11:12.040\n Michael and I have co taught a machine learning class,\n\n11:12.040 --> 11:14.960\n which has now reached, I don't know, 10,000 people at least\n\n11:14.960 --> 11:17.040\n over the last several years, or somewhere there's abouts.\n\n11:17.040 --> 11:21.400\n And my machine learning assignments are of this form.\n\n11:21.400 --> 11:23.820\n So the first one is something like,\n\n11:23.820 --> 11:25.400\n implement these five algorithms,\n\n11:25.400 --> 11:29.680\n KNN and SVMs and boosting and decision trees\n\n11:29.680 --> 11:32.560\n and neural networks, and maybe that's it, I can't remember.\n\n11:32.560 --> 11:34.500\n And when I say implement, I mean steal the code.\n\n11:34.500 --> 11:36.000\n I am completely uninterested.\n\n11:36.000 --> 11:38.800\n You get zero points for getting the thing to work.\n\n11:38.800 --> 11:41.640\n I don't want you spending your time worrying about\n\n11:41.640 --> 11:44.280\n getting the corner case right of what happens\n\n11:44.280 --> 11:46.320\n when you are trying to normalize distances\n\n11:46.320 --> 11:47.480\n and the points on the thing.\n\n11:47.480 --> 11:48.320\n And so you divide by zero.\n\n11:48.320 --> 11:50.020\n I'm not interested in that, right?\n\n11:50.020 --> 11:51.480\n Steal the code.\n\n11:51.480 --> 11:54.080\n However, you're going to run those algorithms\n\n11:54.080 --> 11:55.840\n on two data sets.\n\n11:55.840 --> 11:57.960\n The data sets have to be interesting.\n\n11:57.960 --> 11:58.880\n What does it mean to be interesting?\n\n11:58.880 --> 12:01.060\n Well, data sets interesting if it reveals differences\n\n12:01.060 --> 12:03.760\n between algorithms, which presumably are all the same\n\n12:03.760 --> 12:06.160\n because they can represent whatever they can represent.\n\n12:06.160 --> 12:07.680\n And two data sets are interesting together\n\n12:07.680 --> 12:10.720\n if they show different differences, as it were.\n\n12:10.720 --> 12:11.920\n And you have to analyze them.\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:13.280\n You have to justify their interestingness\n\n12:13.280 --> 12:15.180\n and you have to analyze them in a whole bunch of ways.\n\n12:15.180 --> 12:17.480\n But all I care about is the data in your analysis,\n\n12:17.480 --> 12:18.340\n not the programming.\n\n12:18.340 --> 12:20.720\n And I occasionally end up in these long discussions\n\n12:20.720 --> 12:22.880\n with students, well, I don't really,\n\n12:22.880 --> 12:24.440\n I copy and paste the things that I've said\n\n12:24.440 --> 12:26.320\n the other 15,000 times it's come up,\n\n12:26.320 --> 12:29.020\n which is they go, but the only way to learn,\n\n12:29.020 --> 12:31.320\n really understand is to code them up,\n\n12:31.320 --> 12:33.480\n which is a very programmer,\n\n12:33.480 --> 12:35.220\n software engineering view of the world.\n\n12:35.220 --> 12:37.360\n If you don't program it, you don't understand it,\n\n12:37.360 --> 12:39.020\n which is, by the way, I think is wrong\n\n12:39.020 --> 12:40.600\n in a very specific way.\n\n12:40.600 --> 12:42.880\n But it is a way that you come to understand\n\n12:42.880 --> 12:44.820\n because then you have to wrestle with the algorithm.\n\n12:44.820 --> 12:45.960\n But the thing about machine learning\n\n12:45.960 --> 12:47.660\n is it's not just sorting numbers\n\n12:47.660 --> 12:49.180\n where in some sense the data doesn't matter.\n\n12:49.180 --> 12:50.980\n What matters is, well, does the algorithm work\n\n12:50.980 --> 12:53.020\n on these abstract things, one less than the other?\n\n12:53.020 --> 12:54.780\n In machine learning, the data matters.\n\n12:54.780 --> 12:57.200\n It matters more than almost anything.\n\n12:57.200 --> 12:59.780\n And not everything, but almost anything.\n\n12:59.780 --> 13:02.120\n And so as a result, you have to live with the data\n\n13:02.120 --> 13:04.960\n and don't get distracted by the algorithm per se.\n\n13:04.960 --> 13:07.840\n And I think that that focus on the data\n\n13:07.840 --> 13:09.040\n and what it can tell you\n\n13:09.040 --> 13:11.840\n and what question it's actually answering for you\n\n13:11.840 --> 13:14.000\n as opposed to the question you thought you were asking\n\n13:14.000 --> 13:16.360\n is a key and important thing about machine learning\n\n13:16.360 --> 13:18.960\n and is a way that computationalists\n\n13:18.960 --> 13:21.800\n as opposed to statisticians bring a particular view\n\n13:21.800 --> 13:23.320\n about how to think about the process.\n\n13:23.320 --> 13:25.600\n The statisticians, by contrast, bring,\n\n13:25.600 --> 13:27.880\n I think I'd be willing to say,\n\n13:27.880 --> 13:31.360\n a better view about the kind of formal math that's behind it\n\n13:31.360 --> 13:35.040\n and what an actual number ultimately is saying\n\n13:35.040 --> 13:35.960\n about the data.\n\n13:35.960 --> 13:38.520\n And those are both important, but they're also different.\n\n13:38.520 --> 13:40.360\n I didn't really think of it this way\n\n13:40.360 --> 13:44.480\n is to build intuition about the role of data,\n\n13:44.480 --> 13:45.940\n the different characteristics of data\n\n13:45.940 --> 13:48.160\n by having two data sets that are different\n\n13:48.160 --> 13:50.880\n and they reveal the differences in the differences.\n\n13:50.880 --> 13:52.160\n That's a really fascinating,\n\n13:52.160 --> 13:55.000\n that's a really interesting educational approach.\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:57.500\n The students love it, but not right away.\n\n13:57.500 --> 13:58.340\n No, they love it at the end.\n\n13:58.340 --> 13:59.160\n They love it later.\n\n13:59.160 --> 14:00.100\n They love it at the end.\n\n14:00.100 --> 14:01.200\n Not at the beginning.\n\n14:02.520 --> 14:04.360\n Not even immediately after.\n\n14:04.360 --> 14:06.280\n I feel like there's a deep profound lesson\n\n14:06.280 --> 14:07.560\n about education there.\n\n14:07.560 --> 14:08.400\n Yeah.\n\n14:08.400 --> 14:10.920\n That you can't listen to students\n\n14:10.920 --> 14:14.080\n about whether what you're doing is the right\n\n14:14.080 --> 14:15.140\n or the wrong thing.\n\n14:15.140 --> 14:19.220\n Yeah, well, as a wise, Michael Lippmann once said to me\n\n14:19.220 --> 14:22.060\n about children, which I think applies to teaching,\n\n14:22.060 --> 14:24.940\n is you have to give them what they need\n\n14:24.940 --> 14:27.120\n without bending to their will.\n\n14:27.120 --> 14:28.060\n And students are like that.\n\n14:28.060 --> 14:29.060\n You have to figure out what they need.\n\n14:29.060 --> 14:29.900\n You're a curator.\n\n14:29.900 --> 14:32.060\n Your whole job is to curate and to present\n\n14:32.060 --> 14:33.240\n because on their own,\n\n14:33.240 --> 14:35.060\n they're not gonna necessarily know where to search.\n\n14:35.060 --> 14:37.160\n So you're providing pushes in some direction\n\n14:37.160 --> 14:41.300\n and learn space and you have to give them what they need\n\n14:42.300 --> 14:44.500\n in a way that keeps them engaged enough\n\n14:44.500 --> 14:46.860\n so that they eventually discover what they want\n\n14:46.860 --> 14:48.100\n and they get the tools they need to go\n\n14:48.100 --> 14:50.060\n and learn other things off of.\n\n14:50.060 --> 14:52.180\n What's your view?\n\n14:52.180 --> 14:54.260\n Let me put on my Russian hat,\n\n14:54.260 --> 14:55.780\n which believes that life is suffering.\n\n14:55.780 --> 14:56.820\n I like Russian hats, by the way.\n\n14:56.820 --> 14:58.100\n If you have one, I would like this.\n\n14:58.100 --> 14:59.420\n Those are ridiculous, yes.\n\n14:59.420 --> 15:01.460\n But in a delightful way.\n\n15:01.460 --> 15:02.300\n But sure.\n\n15:04.040 --> 15:06.300\n What do you think is the role of,\n\n15:06.300 --> 15:08.140\n we talked about balance a little bit.\n\n15:08.140 --> 15:11.740\n What do you think is the role of hardship in education?\n\n15:11.740 --> 15:15.540\n Like I think the biggest things I've learned,\n\n15:16.540 --> 15:20.260\n like what made me fall in love with math, for example,\n\n15:20.260 --> 15:24.700\n is by being bad at it until I got good at it.\n\n15:24.700 --> 15:28.400\n So like struggling with a problem,\n\n15:28.400 --> 15:31.160\n which increased the level of joy I felt\n\n15:31.160 --> 15:33.440\n when I finally figured it out.\n\n15:33.440 --> 15:37.220\n And it always felt with me, with teachers,\n\n15:37.220 --> 15:39.760\n especially modern discussions of education,\n\n15:39.760 --> 15:42.420\n how can we make education more fun,\n\n15:42.420 --> 15:44.900\n more engaging, more all those things?\n\n15:44.900 --> 15:46.940\n Or from my perspective, it's like,\n\n15:46.940 --> 15:49.220\n you're maybe missing the point\n\n15:49.220 --> 15:51.780\n that education, that life is suffering.\n\n15:52.740 --> 15:54.840\n Education is supposed to be hard\n\n15:54.840 --> 15:57.860\n and that actually what increases the joy you feel\n\n15:57.860 --> 15:59.540\n when you actually learn something.\n\n15:59.540 --> 16:02.340\n Is that ridiculous?\n\n16:02.340 --> 16:04.380\n Do you like to see your students suffer?\n\n16:04.380 --> 16:07.460\n Okay, so this may be a point where we differ.\n\n16:07.460 --> 16:08.620\n I suspect not.\n\n16:08.620 --> 16:10.180\n I'm gonna do go on.\n\n16:10.180 --> 16:11.220\n Well, what would your answer be?\n\n16:11.220 --> 16:12.060\n I wanna hear you first.\n\n16:12.060 --> 16:14.420\n Okay, well, I was gonna not answer the question.\n\n16:14.420 --> 16:18.180\n You don't want the students to know you enjoy them suffering?\n\n16:18.180 --> 16:19.020\n No, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n16:19.020 --> 16:20.660\n I was gonna say that there's,\n\n16:21.700 --> 16:23.700\n I think there's a distinction that you can make\n\n16:23.700 --> 16:25.020\n in the kind of suffering, right?\n\n16:25.020 --> 16:27.060\n So I think you can be in a mode\n\n16:27.060 --> 16:30.300\n where you're suffering in a hopeless way\n\n16:30.300 --> 16:33.400\n versus you're suffering in a hopeful way, right?\n\n16:33.400 --> 16:37.260\n Where you're like, you can see that if you,\n\n16:37.260 --> 16:39.200\n that you still have,\n\n16:39.200 --> 16:41.940\n you can still imagine getting to the end, right?\n\n16:41.940 --> 16:43.640\n And as long as people are in that mindset\n\n16:43.640 --> 16:44.480\n where they're struggling,\n\n16:44.480 --> 16:47.460\n but it's not a hopeless kind of struggling,\n\n16:47.460 --> 16:49.060\n that's productive.\n\n16:49.060 --> 16:50.540\n I think that's really helpful.\n\n16:50.540 --> 16:53.700\n But it's struggling, like if you break their will,\n\n16:53.700 --> 16:56.140\n if you leave them hopeless.\n\n16:56.140 --> 16:58.660\n No, that don't, sure, some people are gonna,\n\n16:58.660 --> 17:00.500\n whatever, lift themselves up by their bootstraps,\n\n17:00.500 --> 17:01.940\n but like mostly you give up\n\n17:01.940 --> 17:03.520\n and certainly it takes the joy out of it.\n\n17:03.520 --> 17:05.740\n And you're not gonna spend a lot of time\n\n17:05.740 --> 17:07.860\n on something that brings you no joy.\n\n17:07.860 --> 17:10.380\n So it is a bit of a delicate balance, right?\n\n17:10.380 --> 17:12.920\n You have to thwart people in a way\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:17.020\n that they still believe that there's a way through.\n\n17:17.020 --> 17:20.020\n Right, so that's a, we strongly agree actually.\n\n17:20.020 --> 17:21.140\n So I think, well, first off,\n\n17:21.140 --> 17:24.060\n struggling and suffering aren't the same thing, right?\n\n17:24.060 --> 17:25.340\n Yeah, just being poetic.\n\n17:25.340 --> 17:27.660\n Oh, no, no, I actually appreciate the poetry.\n\n17:27.660 --> 17:29.720\n And one of the reasons I appreciate it\n\n17:29.720 --> 17:31.860\n is that they are often the same thing\n\n17:31.860 --> 17:32.900\n and often quite different, right?\n\n17:32.900 --> 17:34.580\n So you can struggle without suffering,\n\n17:34.580 --> 17:37.220\n you can certainly suffer pretty easily.\n\n17:37.220 --> 17:38.820\n You don't necessarily have to struggle to suffer.\n\n17:38.820 --> 17:41.860\n So I think that you want people to struggle,\n\n17:41.860 --> 17:42.940\n but that hope matters.\n\n17:42.940 --> 17:44.620\n You have to, they have to understand\n\n17:44.620 --> 17:46.500\n that they're gonna get through it on the other side.\n\n17:46.500 --> 17:48.740\n And it's very easy to confuse the two.\n\n17:50.060 --> 17:52.580\n I actually think Brown University has a very,\n\n17:52.580 --> 17:55.420\n just philosophically has a very different take\n\n17:55.420 --> 17:56.780\n on the relationship with their students,\n\n17:56.780 --> 17:59.300\n particularly undergrads from say a place like Georgia Tech,\n\n17:59.300 --> 18:00.140\n which is.\n\n18:00.140 --> 18:01.780\n Which university is better?\n\n18:01.780 --> 18:03.340\n Well, I have my opinions on that.\n\n18:03.340 --> 18:05.260\n I mean, remember, Charles said,\n\n18:05.260 --> 18:07.500\n it doesn't matter what the facts are, I'm always right.\n\n18:07.500 --> 18:09.780\n The correct answer is that it doesn't matter,\n\n18:09.780 --> 18:10.980\n they're different.\n\n18:10.980 --> 18:14.460\n But clearly, clearly the answer is different.\n\n18:14.460 --> 18:16.900\n He went to a school like the school\n\n18:16.900 --> 18:18.500\n where he is as an undergrad.\n\n18:18.500 --> 18:21.060\n I went to a school, specifically the same school,\n\n18:21.060 --> 18:23.500\n though it was changed a bit in the intervening years.\n\n18:23.500 --> 18:24.340\n Brown or Georgia Tech?\n\n18:24.340 --> 18:25.260\n No, I was talking about Georgia Tech.\n\n18:25.260 --> 18:28.180\n And I went to an undergrad place\n\n18:28.180 --> 18:29.780\n that's a lot like the place where I work now.\n\n18:29.780 --> 18:32.360\n And so it does seem like we're more familiar\n\n18:32.360 --> 18:33.280\n with these models.\n\n18:33.280 --> 18:35.500\n So there's a similarity between Brown and Yale?\n\n18:35.500 --> 18:38.380\n Yeah, I think they're quite similar, yeah.\n\n18:38.380 --> 18:39.260\n And Duke.\n\n18:39.260 --> 18:40.900\n Duke has some similarities too,\n\n18:40.900 --> 18:42.940\n but it's got a little Southern draw.\n\n18:42.940 --> 18:43.860\n You've kind of worked your,\n\n18:43.860 --> 18:45.540\n you've sort of worked at universities\n\n18:45.540 --> 18:48.800\n that are like the places where you learned.\n\n18:50.000 --> 18:52.180\n And the same would be true for me.\n\n18:52.180 --> 18:56.100\n Are you uncomfortable venturing outside the box?\n\n18:56.100 --> 18:57.300\n Is that what you're saying?\n\n18:57.300 --> 18:58.120\n Journeying out?\n\n18:58.120 --> 18:58.960\n That's not what I'm saying.\n\n18:58.960 --> 19:00.060\n Yeah, Charles is definitely.\n\n19:00.060 --> 19:01.100\n He only goes to places\n\n19:01.100 --> 19:02.960\n that have institute in the name, right?\n\n19:02.960 --> 19:04.060\n It has worked out that way.\n\n19:04.060 --> 19:06.180\n Well, academic places anyway.\n\n19:06.180 --> 19:08.260\n Well, no, I was a visiting scientist at UPenn\n\n19:08.260 --> 19:11.120\n or visiting something at UPenn.\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:14.120\n Oh, wow, I just understood your joke.\n\n19:14.120 --> 19:14.960\n Which one?\n\n19:14.960 --> 19:18.020\n Five minutes later.\n\n19:18.020 --> 19:20.020\n I like to set the sort of time bomb.\n\n19:20.020 --> 19:22.060\n The institute is in the,\n\n19:22.060 --> 19:23.620\n that Charles only goes to places\n\n19:23.620 --> 19:25.780\n that have institute in the name.\n\n19:25.780 --> 19:27.560\n So I guess Georgia,\n\n19:27.560 --> 19:28.860\n I forget that Georgia Tech\n\n19:28.860 --> 19:30.740\n is Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\n19:30.740 --> 19:32.440\n The number of people who refer to it\n\n19:32.440 --> 19:34.300\n as Georgia Tech University is large\n\n19:34.300 --> 19:35.620\n and incredibly irritating.\n\n19:35.620 --> 19:37.820\n It's one of the few things\n\n19:37.820 --> 19:39.220\n that genuinely gets under my skin.\n\n19:39.220 --> 19:41.180\n But like schools like Georgia Tech and MIT\n\n19:41.180 --> 19:42.780\n have as part of the ethos,\n\n19:42.780 --> 19:43.900\n like there is,\n\n19:43.900 --> 19:45.900\n I wanna say there's an abbreviation\n\n19:45.900 --> 19:47.660\n that someone taught me,\n\n19:47.660 --> 19:49.700\n like IHTFP, something like that.\n\n19:49.700 --> 19:51.300\n Like there's an expression\n\n19:51.300 --> 19:53.460\n which is basically I hate being here,\n\n19:53.460 --> 19:55.580\n which they say so proudly.\n\n19:55.580 --> 19:57.980\n And that is definitely not the ethos at Brown.\n\n19:57.980 --> 19:58.820\n Like Brown is,\n\n19:58.820 --> 20:01.140\n there's a little more pampering\n\n20:01.140 --> 20:02.260\n and empowerment and stuff.\n\n20:02.260 --> 20:03.780\n And it's not like we're gonna crush you\n\n20:03.780 --> 20:04.980\n and you're gonna love it.\n\n20:04.980 --> 20:06.300\n So yeah, I think there's a,\n\n20:06.300 --> 20:09.300\n I think the ethoses are different.\n\n20:09.300 --> 20:10.300\n That's interesting, yeah.\n\n20:10.300 --> 20:12.100\n We had Drown Proofing.\n\n20:12.100 --> 20:12.940\n What's that?\n\n20:12.940 --> 20:14.500\n In order to graduate from Georgia Tech,\n\n20:14.500 --> 20:15.320\n this is a true thing.\n\n20:15.320 --> 20:16.940\n Feel free to look it up.\n\n20:16.940 --> 20:17.780\n If you.\n\n20:17.780 --> 20:19.220\n A lot of schools have this by the way.\n\n20:19.220 --> 20:20.900\n No, actually Georgia Tech was barely the first.\n\n20:20.900 --> 20:21.940\n Brandeis has it.\n\n20:21.940 --> 20:23.260\n Had it.\n\n20:23.260 --> 20:25.020\n I feel like Georgia Tech was the first\n\n20:25.020 --> 20:27.460\n in a lot of things.\n\n20:27.460 --> 20:28.860\n It was the first in a lot of things.\n\n20:28.860 --> 20:29.700\n Had the first master's degree.\n\n20:29.700 --> 20:30.600\n First Bumblebee mascot.\n\n20:30.600 --> 20:32.300\n Stop that.\n\n20:32.300 --> 20:34.300\n First master's in computer science actually.\n\n20:34.300 --> 20:35.620\n Right, online master's.\n\n20:35.620 --> 20:37.800\n Well that too, but way back in the 60s.\n\n20:37.800 --> 20:38.640\n NSF grant.\n\n20:38.640 --> 20:39.480\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n20:39.480 --> 20:40.300\n You're the first information\n\n20:40.300 --> 20:42.820\n and computer science master's degree in the country.\n\n20:42.820 --> 20:45.660\n But the Georgia Tech,\n\n20:45.660 --> 20:46.580\n it used to be the case\n\n20:46.580 --> 20:48.300\n that in order to graduate from Georgia Tech,\n\n20:48.300 --> 20:49.980\n you had to take a Drown Proofing class.\n\n20:49.980 --> 20:52.340\n Where effectively, they threw you in the water\n\n20:52.340 --> 20:53.180\n and tied you up.\n\n20:53.180 --> 20:54.620\n If you didn't drown, you got to graduate.\n\n20:54.620 --> 20:55.780\n Tied you up?\n\n20:55.780 --> 20:56.620\n I believe so.\n\n20:56.620 --> 20:57.440\n No.\n\n20:57.440 --> 20:58.500\n There were certainly versions of it,\n\n20:58.500 --> 21:00.460\n but I mean luckily they ended it\n\n21:00.460 --> 21:01.620\n just before I had to graduate\n\n21:01.620 --> 21:03.220\n because otherwise I would have never graduated.\n\n21:03.220 --> 21:04.300\n It wasn't going to happen.\n\n21:04.300 --> 21:06.460\n I want to say 84, 83,\n\n21:06.460 --> 21:08.100\n somewhere around then they ended it.\n\n21:08.100 --> 21:10.420\n But yeah, you used to have to prove\n\n21:10.420 --> 21:13.220\n you could tread water for some ridiculous amount of time\n\n21:13.220 --> 21:14.060\n or you couldn't graduate.\n\n21:14.060 --> 21:14.900\n Two minutes.\n\n21:14.900 --> 21:15.720\n No, it was more than two minutes.\n\n21:15.720 --> 21:16.560\n I bet it was two minutes.\n\n21:16.560 --> 21:17.400\n Okay, well we'll look at it.\n\n21:17.400 --> 21:18.340\n And it was in a bathtub.\n\n21:18.340 --> 21:19.180\n Yeah, right.\n\n21:19.180 --> 21:20.020\n You could just stare.\n\n21:20.020 --> 21:20.900\n It was in a pool.\n\n21:20.900 --> 21:21.740\n But it was a real thing.\n\n21:21.740 --> 21:23.500\n But that idea that, you know, push you.\n\n21:23.500 --> 21:24.380\n Fully clothed.\n\n21:24.380 --> 21:25.300\n Yeah, fully clothed.\n\n21:25.300 --> 21:27.460\n I bet it was that and not tied up.\n\n21:27.460 --> 21:30.420\n Because who needs to learn how to swim when you're tied?\n\n21:30.420 --> 21:31.260\n Nobody.\n\n21:31.260 --> 21:32.540\n But who needs to learn to swim\n\n21:32.540 --> 21:34.220\n when you're actually falling into the water dressed?\n\n21:34.220 --> 21:35.060\n That's a real thing.\n\n21:35.060 --> 21:36.700\n I think your facts are getting in the way\n\n21:36.700 --> 21:37.540\n with a good story.\n\n21:37.540 --> 21:38.360\n Oh, that's fair.\n\n21:38.360 --> 21:39.200\n That's fair.\n\n21:39.200 --> 21:40.040\n I didn't mean to.\n\n21:40.040 --> 21:40.860\n All right, so they tie you up.\n\n21:40.860 --> 21:41.980\n Sometimes the narrative matters.\n\n21:41.980 --> 21:43.300\n But whatever it was, you had to,\n\n21:43.300 --> 21:44.820\n it was called drown proofing for a reason.\n\n21:44.820 --> 21:49.500\n The point of the story, Michael, is that it's,\n\n21:49.500 --> 21:50.700\n well, no, but that's good.\n\n21:50.700 --> 21:52.340\n It doesn't bring it back to struggle.\n\n21:52.340 --> 21:54.980\n That's a part of what Georgia Tech has always been.\n\n21:54.980 --> 21:56.740\n And we struggle with that, by the way,\n\n21:56.740 --> 21:59.860\n about what we want to be, particularly as things go.\n\n21:59.860 --> 22:02.140\n But you sort of,\n\n22:02.140 --> 22:06.660\n how much can you be pushed without breaking?\n\n22:06.660 --> 22:08.940\n And you come out of the other end stronger, right?\n\n22:08.940 --> 22:09.780\n There's a saying we used to have\n\n22:09.780 --> 22:10.620\n when I was an undergrad there.\n\n22:10.620 --> 22:11.660\n It was just Georgia Tech,\n\n22:11.660 --> 22:13.700\n building tomorrow the night before.\n\n22:13.700 --> 22:14.540\n Right?\n\n22:14.540 --> 22:17.780\n And it was just kind of idea that,\n\n22:17.780 --> 22:19.460\n give me something impossible to do\n\n22:19.460 --> 22:20.900\n and I'll do it in a couple of days\n\n22:20.900 --> 22:21.900\n because that's what I just spent\n\n22:21.900 --> 22:24.140\n the last four or five or six years with.\n\n22:24.140 --> 22:26.860\n That ethos definitely stuck to you.\n\n22:26.860 --> 22:28.980\n Having now done a number of projects with you,\n\n22:28.980 --> 22:30.420\n you definitely will do it the night before.\n\n22:30.420 --> 22:31.340\n That's not entirely true.\n\n22:31.340 --> 22:33.620\n There's nothing wrong with waiting until the last minute.\n\n22:33.620 --> 22:35.660\n The secret is knowing when the last minute is.\n\n22:35.660 --> 22:38.260\n Right, that's brilliantly put.\n\n22:38.260 --> 22:41.700\n Yeah, that is a definite Charles statement\n\n22:41.700 --> 22:43.380\n that I am trying not to embrace.\n\n22:44.860 --> 22:45.700\n And I appreciate that\n\n22:45.700 --> 22:47.700\n because you helped move my last minute up.\n\n22:47.700 --> 22:49.300\n That's the social construct\n\n22:49.300 --> 22:50.780\n the way you converge together\n\n22:50.780 --> 22:53.140\n what the definition of last minute is.\n\n22:53.140 --> 22:54.660\n We figure that all out together.\n\n22:54.660 --> 22:58.580\n In fact, MIT, I'm sure a lot of universities have this,\n\n22:58.580 --> 23:00.380\n but MIT has like MIT time\n\n23:00.380 --> 23:03.740\n that everyone has always agreed together\n\n23:03.740 --> 23:05.500\n that there is such a concept\n\n23:05.500 --> 23:08.740\n and everyone just keeps showing up like 10 to 15 to 20,\n\n23:08.740 --> 23:11.420\n depending on the department, late to everything.\n\n23:11.420 --> 23:13.940\n So there's like a weird drift that happens.\n\n23:13.940 --> 23:14.900\n It's kind of fascinating.\n\n23:14.900 --> 23:15.980\n Yeah, we're five minutes.\n\n23:15.980 --> 23:16.820\n We're five minutes.\n\n23:16.820 --> 23:18.620\n In fact, the classes will say,\n\n23:18.620 --> 23:20.380\n well, this is no longer true actually,\n\n23:20.380 --> 23:22.540\n but it used to be a class that started at eight,\n\n23:22.540 --> 23:24.180\n but actually it started at eight oh five,\n\n23:24.180 --> 23:26.460\n it ends at nine, actually it ends at eight fifty five.\n\n23:26.460 --> 23:27.460\n Everything's five minutes off\n\n23:27.460 --> 23:29.420\n and nobody expects anything to start until five minutes\n\n23:29.420 --> 23:31.580\n after the half hour, whatever it is.\n\n23:31.580 --> 23:32.420\n It still exists.\n\n23:32.420 --> 23:33.260\n It hurts my head.\n\n23:33.260 --> 23:37.860\n Well, let's rewind the clock back to the fifties and sixties\n\n23:37.860 --> 23:39.580\n when you guys met, how did you,\n\n23:39.580 --> 23:40.820\n I'm just kidding, I don't know.\n\n23:40.820 --> 23:43.100\n But what, can you tell the story of how you met?\n\n23:43.100 --> 23:45.420\n So you've, like the internet and the world\n\n23:45.420 --> 23:50.180\n kind of knows you as connected in some ways\n\n23:50.180 --> 23:53.100\n in terms of education of teaching the world.\n\n23:53.100 --> 23:54.740\n That's like the public facing thing,\n\n23:54.740 --> 23:56.740\n but how did you as human beings\n\n23:56.740 --> 24:00.700\n and as collaborators meet?\n\n24:00.700 --> 24:01.780\n I think there's two stories.\n\n24:01.780 --> 24:05.260\n One is how we met and the other is how we\n\n24:05.260 --> 24:06.220\n got to know each other.\n\n24:06.220 --> 24:08.260\n I'm not gonna say fell in love.\n\n24:08.260 --> 24:11.180\n I'm gonna say that we came to understand that we\n\n24:11.180 --> 24:13.660\n Had some common something.\n\n24:13.660 --> 24:14.620\n Yeah, it's funny.\n\n24:14.620 --> 24:16.660\n Cause on the surface, I think we're different\n\n24:16.660 --> 24:18.820\n in a lot of ways, but there's something\n\n24:18.820 --> 24:21.740\n Yeah, I mean, now we complete each other's\n\n24:21.740 --> 24:22.580\n There you go.\n\n24:22.580 --> 24:23.580\n Afternoon.\n\n24:23.580 --> 24:25.980\n So I will tell the story of how we met\n\n24:25.980 --> 24:27.940\n and I'll let Michael tell the story of how we met.\n\n24:27.940 --> 24:28.780\n Okay, all right.\n\n24:28.780 --> 24:30.140\n Okay, so here's how we met.\n\n24:30.140 --> 24:32.980\n I was already at that point, it was AT&T labs.\n\n24:32.980 --> 24:34.180\n There's a long, interesting story there.\n\n24:34.180 --> 24:38.780\n But anyway, I was there and Michael was coming to interview.\n\n24:38.780 --> 24:40.300\n He was a professor at Duke at the time,\n\n24:40.300 --> 24:44.100\n but decided for reasons that he wanted to be in New Jersey.\n\n24:45.140 --> 24:48.860\n And so that would mean Bell Labs slash AT&T labs.\n\n24:48.860 --> 24:49.700\n And we were doing the interview.\n\n24:49.700 --> 24:51.540\n Interviews are very much like academic interviews.\n\n24:51.540 --> 24:53.220\n And so I had to be there.\n\n24:53.220 --> 24:54.860\n We all had to meet with him afterwards\n\n24:54.860 --> 24:56.180\n and so on, one on one.\n\n24:56.180 --> 24:59.460\n But it was obvious to me that he was going to be hired.\n\n24:59.460 --> 25:01.100\n Like no matter what, because everyone loved him.\n\n25:01.100 --> 25:03.300\n They were just talking about all the great stuff he did.\n\n25:03.300 --> 25:04.300\n Oh, he did this great thing.\n\n25:04.300 --> 25:06.500\n And you had just won something at AAAI, I think.\n\n25:06.500 --> 25:08.580\n Or maybe you got 18 papers in AAAI that year.\n\n25:08.580 --> 25:10.260\n I got the best paper award at AAAI\n\n25:10.260 --> 25:11.380\n for the crossword stuff.\n\n25:11.380 --> 25:12.220\n Right, exactly.\n\n25:12.220 --> 25:14.020\n So that had all happened and everyone was going on\n\n25:14.020 --> 25:14.860\n and on and on about it.\n\n25:14.860 --> 25:16.600\n Actually, so Tinder was saying incredibly nice things\n\n25:16.600 --> 25:17.440\n about you.\n\n25:17.440 --> 25:18.260\n Really?\n\n25:18.260 --> 25:19.100\n Yes.\n\n25:19.100 --> 25:19.940\n He can be very grumpy.\n\n25:19.940 --> 25:20.760\n Yes.\n\n25:20.760 --> 25:21.600\n That's nice to hear.\n\n25:21.600 --> 25:22.500\n He was grumpily saying very nice things.\n\n25:22.500 --> 25:23.340\n Oh, that makes sense.\n\n25:23.340 --> 25:24.180\n And that does make sense.\n\n25:24.180 --> 25:25.940\n So, you know, it was going to come.\n\n25:25.940 --> 25:28.060\n So why was I meeting him?\n\n25:28.060 --> 25:29.060\n I had something else I had to do.\n\n25:29.060 --> 25:29.900\n I can't remember what it was.\n\n25:29.900 --> 25:31.300\n It probably involved comedy.\n\n25:31.300 --> 25:32.340\n So he remembers meeting me\n\n25:32.340 --> 25:34.180\n as inconveniencing his afternoon.\n\n25:34.180 --> 25:35.020\n So he came.\n\n25:35.020 --> 25:36.140\n So I eventually came to my office.\n\n25:36.140 --> 25:37.080\n I was in the middle of trying to do something.\n\n25:37.080 --> 25:37.920\n I can't remember what.\n\n25:37.920 --> 25:38.980\n And he came and he sat down.\n\n25:38.980 --> 25:41.160\n And for reasons that are purely accidental,\n\n25:41.160 --> 25:42.560\n despite what Michael thinks,\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:44.740\n my desk at the time was set up\n\n25:44.740 --> 25:46.660\n in such a way that it had sort of an L shape.\n\n25:46.660 --> 25:48.740\n And the chair on the outside was always lower\n\n25:48.740 --> 25:50.380\n than the chair that I was in.\n\n25:50.380 --> 25:52.620\n And, you know, the kind of point was to...\n\n25:52.620 --> 25:54.440\n The only reason I think that it was on purpose\n\n25:54.440 --> 25:56.220\n is because you told me it was on purpose.\n\n25:56.220 --> 25:57.060\n I don't remember that.\n\n25:57.060 --> 25:59.020\n Anyway, the thing is, is that, you know, it kind of gives...\n\n25:59.020 --> 26:00.260\n His guest chair was really low\n\n26:00.260 --> 26:02.940\n so that he could look down at everybody.\n\n26:02.940 --> 26:04.940\n The idea was just to simply create a nice environment\n\n26:04.940 --> 26:06.220\n that you were asking for a mortgage\n\n26:06.220 --> 26:07.120\n and I was going to say no.\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:07.960\n That was the point.\n\n26:07.960 --> 26:09.500\n It was a very simple idea here.\n\n26:09.500 --> 26:10.980\n Anyway, so we sat there\n\n26:10.980 --> 26:12.260\n and we just talked for a little while.\n\n26:12.260 --> 26:14.460\n And I think he got the impression that I didn't like him.\n\n26:14.460 --> 26:15.300\n Which wasn't true.\n\n26:15.300 --> 26:16.120\n I strongly got that impression.\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:16.960\n The talk was really good.\n\n26:16.960 --> 26:18.680\n The talk, by the way, was terrible.\n\n26:18.680 --> 26:20.300\n And right after the talk,\n\n26:20.300 --> 26:21.700\n I said to my host, Michael Kearns,\n\n26:21.700 --> 26:23.340\n who ultimately was my boss.\n\n26:23.340 --> 26:24.180\n I'm a huge fan.\n\n26:24.180 --> 26:25.780\n I'm a friend and a huge fan of Michael, yeah.\n\n26:25.780 --> 26:28.140\n Yeah, he is a remarkable person.\n\n26:29.660 --> 26:30.980\n After my talk, I went into the...\n\n26:30.980 --> 26:32.420\n He went into basketball.\n\n26:32.420 --> 26:33.260\n I went...\n\n26:33.260 --> 26:34.080\n Racquetball, he's good at everything.\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:34.920\n No, basketball.\n\n26:34.920 --> 26:36.020\n No, but basketball and racquetball too.\n\n26:36.020 --> 26:36.860\n Squash.\n\n26:36.860 --> 26:38.180\n Squash, squash, squash, not racquetball.\n\n26:38.180 --> 26:39.980\n Yes, squash, which is not...\n\n26:39.980 --> 26:41.420\n Racquetball, yes.\n\n26:41.420 --> 26:42.240\n Squash, no.\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:43.980\n And I hope you hear that, Michael.\n\n26:43.980 --> 26:45.980\n Oh, Michael Kearns.\n\n26:45.980 --> 26:47.580\n As a game, not his skill level,\n\n26:47.580 --> 26:49.140\n because I'm pretty sure he's...\n\n26:50.060 --> 26:51.600\n All right, there's some competitiveness there,\n\n26:51.600 --> 26:54.360\n but the point is that it was like the middle of the day,\n\n26:54.360 --> 26:55.760\n I had full day of interviews.\n\n26:55.760 --> 26:56.620\n I got met with people,\n\n26:56.620 --> 26:58.900\n but then in the middle of the day, I gave a job talk.\n\n26:58.900 --> 27:01.540\n And then there was gonna be more interviews,\n\n27:01.540 --> 27:04.860\n but I pulled Michael aside and I said,\n\n27:04.860 --> 27:07.240\n I think it's in both of our best interest\n\n27:07.240 --> 27:11.100\n if I just leave now, because that was so bad\n\n27:11.100 --> 27:12.540\n that it'd just be embarrassing\n\n27:12.540 --> 27:14.300\n if I have to talk to any more people.\n\n27:14.300 --> 27:16.380\n You look bad for having invited me.\n\n27:16.380 --> 27:19.580\n It's just, let's just forget this ever happened.\n\n27:19.580 --> 27:21.780\n So I don't think the talk went well.\n\n27:21.780 --> 27:23.620\n That's one of the most Michael Lipman set of sentences\n\n27:23.620 --> 27:24.540\n I think I've ever heard.\n\n27:24.540 --> 27:27.220\n He did great, or at least everyone knew he was great,\n\n27:27.220 --> 27:28.220\n so maybe it didn't matter.\n\n27:28.220 --> 27:29.940\n I was there, I remember the talk,\n\n27:29.940 --> 27:31.980\n and I remember him being very much the way\n\n27:31.980 --> 27:33.980\n I remember him now, on any given week.\n\n27:33.980 --> 27:34.800\n So it was good.\n\n27:34.800 --> 27:36.620\n And we met and we talked about stuff.\n\n27:36.620 --> 27:37.940\n He thinks I didn't like him, but...\n\n27:37.940 --> 27:39.340\n Because he was so grumpy.\n\n27:39.340 --> 27:40.740\n Must've been the chair thing.\n\n27:40.740 --> 27:42.700\n The chair thing and the low voice, I think.\n\n27:42.700 --> 27:43.700\n But like, he obviously...\n\n27:43.700 --> 27:47.020\n And that slight skeptical look.\n\n27:47.020 --> 27:48.540\n Yes.\n\n27:48.540 --> 27:50.540\n I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n27:50.540 --> 27:51.900\n Well, I probably didn't have any idea\n\n27:51.900 --> 27:53.820\n what you were talking about.\n\n27:53.820 --> 27:54.820\n Anyway, I liked him.\n\n27:54.820 --> 27:56.420\n He asked me questions, I answered questions.\n\n27:56.420 --> 27:57.380\n I felt bad about myself.\n\n27:57.380 --> 27:58.340\n It was a normal day.\n\n27:58.340 --> 28:00.540\n It was a normal day.\n\n28:00.540 --> 28:01.380\n And then he left.\n\n28:01.380 --> 28:03.140\n And then he left, and that's how you met.\n\n28:03.140 --> 28:03.980\n Can we take a...\n\n28:03.980 --> 28:05.860\n And then I got hired and I was in the group.\n\n28:05.860 --> 28:09.100\n Can we take a slight tangent on this topic of,\n\n28:09.100 --> 28:11.500\n it sounds like, maybe you could speak\n\n28:11.500 --> 28:12.580\n to the bigger picture.\n\n28:12.580 --> 28:15.060\n It sounds like you're quite self critical.\n\n28:15.060 --> 28:15.900\n Who, Charles?\n\n28:15.900 --> 28:16.720\n No, you.\n\n28:16.720 --> 28:17.560\n Oh.\n\n28:17.560 --> 28:18.560\n I can do better.\n\n28:18.560 --> 28:19.400\n I can do better.\n\n28:19.400 --> 28:20.220\n Try me again.\n\n28:20.220 --> 28:21.060\n I'll do better.\n\n28:21.060 --> 28:21.900\n I'll be so self critical.\n\n28:21.900 --> 28:22.740\n I won't.\n\n28:22.740 --> 28:23.560\n I won't.\n\n28:23.560 --> 28:24.400\n I won't.\n\n28:24.400 --> 28:26.420\n Yeah, that was like a three out of 10 response.\n\n28:26.420 --> 28:30.380\n So let's try to work it up to five and six.\n\n28:30.380 --> 28:35.160\n Yeah, I remember Marvin Minsky said on a video interview,\n\n28:35.160 --> 28:38.820\n something that the key to success in academic research\n\n28:38.820 --> 28:40.420\n is to hate everything you do.\n\n28:43.580 --> 28:44.420\n For some reason...\n\n28:44.420 --> 28:46.820\n I think I followed that because I hate everything he's done.\n\n28:46.820 --> 28:49.740\n That's a good line.\n\n28:49.740 --> 28:52.660\n That's a six out of 10.\n\n28:52.660 --> 28:53.500\n Maybe that's a keeper.\n\n28:53.500 --> 28:57.660\n But do you find that resonates with you at all\n\n28:57.660 --> 28:59.740\n in how you think about talks and so on?\n\n28:59.740 --> 29:00.840\n I would say it differently.\n\n29:00.840 --> 29:01.680\n It's not that.\n\n29:01.680 --> 29:02.500\n No, not really.\n\n29:02.500 --> 29:04.460\n That's such an MIT view of the world though.\n\n29:04.460 --> 29:08.480\n So I remember talking about this when, as a student,\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:10.980\n you were basically told I will clean it up\n\n29:10.980 --> 29:12.580\n for the purpose of the podcast.\n\n29:13.660 --> 29:14.500\n My work is crap.\n\n29:14.500 --> 29:15.320\n My work is crap.\n\n29:15.320 --> 29:16.160\n My work is crap.\n\n29:16.160 --> 29:17.660\n Then you go to a conference or something.\n\n29:17.660 --> 29:18.980\n You're like, everybody else's work is crap.\n\n29:18.980 --> 29:19.820\n Everybody else's work is crap.\n\n29:19.820 --> 29:23.260\n And you feel better and better about it, relatively speaking.\n\n29:23.260 --> 29:25.060\n And then you sort of keep working on it.\n\n29:25.060 --> 29:26.820\n I don't hate my work.\n\n29:26.820 --> 29:27.660\n That resonates with me.\n\n29:27.660 --> 29:28.900\n Yes, I've never hated my work,\n\n29:28.900 --> 29:33.460\n but I have been dissatisfied with it.\n\n29:33.460 --> 29:35.980\n And I think being dissatisfied,\n\n29:35.980 --> 29:38.620\n being okay with the fact that you've taken a positive step,\n\n29:38.620 --> 29:40.340\n the derivative's positive,\n\n29:40.340 --> 29:42.300\n maybe even the second derivative's positive,\n\n29:42.300 --> 29:45.060\n that's important because that's a part of the hope, right?\n\n29:45.060 --> 29:47.300\n But you have to, but I haven't gotten there yet.\n\n29:47.300 --> 29:49.880\n If that's not there, that I haven't gotten there yet,\n\n29:49.880 --> 29:53.460\n then it's hard to move forward, I think.\n\n29:53.460 --> 29:55.100\n So I buy that, which is a little different\n\n29:55.100 --> 29:56.420\n from hating everything that you do.\n\n29:56.420 --> 29:59.300\n Yeah, I mean, there's things that I've done\n\n29:59.300 --> 30:01.260\n that I like better than I like myself.\n\n30:01.260 --> 30:04.040\n So it's separating me from the work, essentially.\n\n30:04.040 --> 30:06.780\n So I think I am very critical of myself,\n\n30:06.780 --> 30:08.700\n but sometimes the work I'm really excited about.\n\n30:08.700 --> 30:10.540\n And sometimes I think it's kind of good.\n\n30:10.540 --> 30:11.380\n Does that happen right away?\n\n30:11.380 --> 30:15.380\n So I found the work that I've liked, that I've done,\n\n30:15.380 --> 30:18.420\n most of it, I liked it in retrospect\n\n30:18.420 --> 30:21.220\n more when I was far away from it in time.\n\n30:21.220 --> 30:24.380\n I have to be fairly excited about it to get done.\n\n30:24.380 --> 30:26.900\n No, excited at the time, but then happy with the result.\n\n30:26.900 --> 30:28.780\n But years later, or even I might go back,\n\n30:28.780 --> 30:31.180\n you know what, that actually turned out to matter.\n\n30:31.180 --> 30:32.020\n That turned out to matter.\n\n30:32.020 --> 30:34.220\n Or, oh gosh, it turns out I've been thinking about that.\n\n30:34.220 --> 30:36.420\n It's actually influenced all the work that I've done since\n\n30:36.420 --> 30:37.860\n without realizing it.\n\n30:37.860 --> 30:39.220\n Boy, that guy was smart.\n\n30:39.220 --> 30:41.300\n Yeah, that guy had a future.\n\n30:41.300 --> 30:46.300\n Yeah, I think there's something to it.\n\n30:47.060 --> 30:48.060\n I think there's something to the idea\n\n30:48.060 --> 30:50.340\n you've got to hate what you do, but it's not quite hate.\n\n30:50.340 --> 30:52.580\n It's just being unsatisfied.\n\n30:52.580 --> 30:54.300\n And different people motivate themselves differently.\n\n30:54.300 --> 30:56.740\n I don't happen to motivate myself with self loathing.\n\n30:56.740 --> 30:58.860\n I happen to motivate myself with something else.\n\n30:58.860 --> 31:02.900\n So you're able to sit back and be proud of,\n\n31:02.900 --> 31:04.780\n in retrospect, of the work you've done.\n\n31:04.780 --> 31:06.540\n Well, and it's easier when you can connect it\n\n31:06.540 --> 31:08.940\n with other people, because then you can be proud of them.\n\n31:08.940 --> 31:10.180\n Proud of the people, yeah.\n\n31:10.180 --> 31:11.020\n And then the question is.\n\n31:11.020 --> 31:12.420\n You can still safely hate yourself.\n\n31:12.420 --> 31:13.700\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n31:13.700 --> 31:15.220\n It's win, win, Michael.\n\n31:15.220 --> 31:18.420\n Or at least win, lose, which is what you're looking for.\n\n31:18.420 --> 31:22.180\n Oh, wow, there's so many brilliant minds in this.\n\n31:22.180 --> 31:23.580\n There's levels.\n\n31:23.580 --> 31:26.020\n So how did you actually meet me?\n\n31:26.020 --> 31:26.860\n Yeah, Michael.\n\n31:26.860 --> 31:28.540\n So the way I think about it is,\n\n31:28.540 --> 31:32.500\n because we didn't do much research together at AT&T,\n\n31:32.500 --> 31:34.540\n but then we all got laid off.\n\n31:34.540 --> 31:36.540\n So that sucked.\n\n31:36.540 --> 31:37.940\n By the way, sorry to interrupt,\n\n31:37.940 --> 31:40.500\n but that was one of the most magical places\n\n31:40.500 --> 31:42.340\n historically speaking.\n\n31:42.340 --> 31:44.260\n They did not appreciate what they had.\n\n31:45.700 --> 31:46.540\n And how do we,\n\n31:47.940 --> 31:50.180\n I feel like there's a profound lesson in there too.\n\n31:50.180 --> 31:53.100\n How do we get it, like what was, why was it so magical?\n\n31:53.100 --> 31:54.940\n Is it just a coincidence of history?\n\n31:54.940 --> 31:56.380\n Or is there something special about?\n\n31:56.380 --> 31:57.740\n There were some really good managers\n\n31:57.740 --> 32:00.460\n and people who really believed in machine learning\n\n32:00.460 --> 32:03.100\n as this is gonna be important.\n\n32:03.100 --> 32:05.620\n Let's get the people who are thinking about this\n\n32:05.620 --> 32:08.060\n in creative and insightful ways\n\n32:08.060 --> 32:10.260\n and put them in one place and stir.\n\n32:10.260 --> 32:11.500\n Yeah, but even beyond that, right?\n\n32:11.500 --> 32:15.540\n It was Bell Labs at its heyday.\n\n32:15.540 --> 32:17.980\n And even when we were there, which I think was past its heyday.\n\n32:17.980 --> 32:19.700\n And to be clear, he's gotten to be at Bell Labs.\n\n32:19.700 --> 32:21.100\n I never got to be at Bell Labs.\n\n32:21.100 --> 32:22.300\n I joined after that.\n\n32:22.300 --> 32:24.620\n Yeah, I showed up in 91 as a grad student.\n\n32:24.620 --> 32:28.420\n So I was there for a long time, every summer, except for two.\n\n32:28.420 --> 32:29.580\n So twice I worked for companies\n\n32:29.580 --> 32:31.900\n that had just stopped being Bell Labs.\n\n32:31.900 --> 32:33.620\n Bellcore and then AT&T Labs.\n\n32:33.620 --> 32:37.300\n So Bell Labs was several locations or for the research\n\n32:37.300 --> 32:38.140\n or is it one?\n\n32:38.140 --> 32:41.020\n I don't know if Jersey's involved somehow.\n\n32:41.020 --> 32:41.900\n They're all in Jersey.\n\n32:41.900 --> 32:42.740\n Yeah, they're all over the place.\n\n32:42.740 --> 32:44.060\n But they were in a couple of places in Jersey.\n\n32:44.060 --> 32:47.420\n Murray Hill was the Bell Labs place.\n\n32:47.420 --> 32:49.820\n So you had an office in Murray Hill\n\n32:49.820 --> 32:51.100\n at one point in your career.\n\n32:51.100 --> 32:53.380\n Yeah, and I played Ultimate Frisbee\n\n32:53.380 --> 32:56.340\n on the cricket pitch at Bell Labs at Murray Hill.\n\n32:56.340 --> 32:58.300\n And then it became AT&T Labs when it split off\n\n32:58.300 --> 33:00.940\n with loose during what we called Trivestiture.\n\n33:00.940 --> 33:03.660\n Are you better than Michael Korn's at Ultimate Frisbee?\n\n33:03.660 --> 33:04.580\n Yeah. Oh, yeah.\n\n33:04.580 --> 33:05.420\n Okay.\n\n33:05.420 --> 33:06.620\n But I think that one's not boasting.\n\n33:06.620 --> 33:08.580\n I think Charles plays a lot of Ultimate\n\n33:08.580 --> 33:10.500\n and I don't think Michael does.\n\n33:10.500 --> 33:12.100\n Yes, but that wasn't the point.\n\n33:12.100 --> 33:12.940\n The point is yes.\n\n33:12.940 --> 33:13.780\n I'm finally better.\n\n33:13.780 --> 33:14.620\n Sorry.\n\n33:14.620 --> 33:17.420\n Okay, I have played on a championship winning\n\n33:17.420 --> 33:19.420\n Ultimate Frisbee team or whatever,\n\n33:19.420 --> 33:20.780\n Ultimate team with Charles.\n\n33:20.780 --> 33:22.660\n So I know how good he is.\n\n33:22.660 --> 33:23.500\n He's really good.\n\n33:23.500 --> 33:24.620\n How good I was anyway, when I was younger.\n\n33:24.620 --> 33:25.460\n But the thing is.\n\n33:25.460 --> 33:26.820\n I know how young he was when he was younger.\n\n33:26.820 --> 33:27.740\n That's true.\n\n33:27.740 --> 33:28.900\n So much younger than now.\n\n33:28.900 --> 33:29.820\n He's older now.\n\n33:29.820 --> 33:30.660\n Yeah, I'm older.\n\n33:30.660 --> 33:33.140\n Michael was a much better basketball player than I was.\n\n33:33.140 --> 33:34.380\n Michael Kearns.\n\n33:34.380 --> 33:36.220\n Yes, no, not Michael.\n\n33:36.220 --> 33:37.060\n Let's be very clear about that.\n\n33:37.060 --> 33:38.820\n To be clear, I've not played basketball with you.\n\n33:38.820 --> 33:40.460\n So you don't know how terrible I am,\n\n33:40.460 --> 33:42.340\n but you have a probably pretty good guess.\n\n33:42.340 --> 33:44.300\n And that you're not as good as Michael Kearns.\n\n33:44.300 --> 33:45.740\n He's tall and athletic.\n\n33:45.740 --> 33:46.580\n And he cared about it.\n\n33:46.580 --> 33:47.420\n He's very athletic.\n\n33:47.420 --> 33:48.240\n He's very good.\n\n33:48.240 --> 33:49.080\n And probably competitive.\n\n33:49.080 --> 33:50.300\n I love hanging out with Michael.\n\n33:50.300 --> 33:51.660\n Anyway, but we were talking about something else,\n\n33:51.660 --> 33:52.980\n although I no longer remember what it was.\n\n33:52.980 --> 33:53.820\n What were we talking about?\n\n33:53.820 --> 33:54.660\n Oh, Bell Labs.\n\n33:54.660 --> 33:55.500\n Oh, Bell Labs.\n\n33:55.500 --> 33:56.340\n But also Labs.\n\n33:56.340 --> 34:00.220\n So this was kind of cool about what was magical about it.\n\n34:00.220 --> 34:01.300\n The first thing you have to know\n\n34:01.300 --> 34:03.500\n is that Bell Labs was an arm of the government, right?\n\n34:03.500 --> 34:05.300\n Because AT&T was an arm of the government.\n\n34:05.300 --> 34:06.500\n It was a monopoly.\n\n34:07.420 --> 34:10.780\n And every month you paid a little thing on your phone bill,\n\n34:10.780 --> 34:12.000\n which turned out was a tax\n\n34:12.000 --> 34:14.340\n for all the research that Bell Labs was doing.\n\n34:14.340 --> 34:16.700\n And they invented transistors and the laser\n\n34:16.700 --> 34:17.540\n and whatever else is that they did.\n\n34:17.540 --> 34:20.580\n The Big Bang or whatever, the cosmic background radiation.\n\n34:20.580 --> 34:21.420\n Yeah, they did all that stuff.\n\n34:21.420 --> 34:23.380\n They had some amazing stuff with directional microphones,\n\n34:23.380 --> 34:24.220\n by the way.\n\n34:24.220 --> 34:25.520\n I got to go in this room\n\n34:25.520 --> 34:27.940\n where they had all these panels and everything.\n\n34:27.940 --> 34:29.460\n And we would talk and one another,\n\n34:29.460 --> 34:30.740\n and he'd move some panels around.\n\n34:30.740 --> 34:33.700\n And then he would have me step two steps to the left.\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:35.100\n And I couldn't hear a thing he was saying\n\n34:35.100 --> 34:37.100\n because nothing was bouncing off the walls.\n\n34:37.100 --> 34:38.460\n And then he would shut it all down\n\n34:38.460 --> 34:40.340\n and you could hear your heartbeat,\n\n34:40.340 --> 34:43.320\n which is deeply disturbing to hear your heartbeat.\n\n34:43.320 --> 34:44.160\n You can feel it.\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:44.980\n I mean, you can feel it now.\n\n34:44.980 --> 34:46.620\n There's just so much all this sort of noise around.\n\n34:46.620 --> 34:48.300\n Anyway, Bell Labs was about pure research.\n\n34:48.300 --> 34:50.420\n It was a university, in some sense,\n\n34:50.420 --> 34:53.660\n the purest sense of a university, but without students.\n\n34:53.660 --> 34:56.300\n So it was all the faculty working with one another\n\n34:56.300 --> 34:57.860\n and students would come in to learn.\n\n34:57.860 --> 34:59.220\n They would come in for three or four months\n\n34:59.220 --> 35:00.860\n during the summer and they would go away.\n\n35:00.860 --> 35:02.820\n But it was just this kind of wonderful experience.\n\n35:02.820 --> 35:04.700\n I could walk out my door.\n\n35:04.700 --> 35:06.540\n In fact, I would often have to walk out my door\n\n35:06.540 --> 35:08.320\n and deal with Rich Sutton and Michael Kearns\n\n35:08.320 --> 35:10.940\n yelling at each other about whatever it is\n\n35:10.940 --> 35:13.380\n they were yelling about the proper way\n\n35:13.380 --> 35:14.620\n to prove something or another.\n\n35:14.620 --> 35:15.580\n And I could just do that.\n\n35:15.580 --> 35:17.980\n And Dave McAllister and Peter Stone\n\n35:17.980 --> 35:19.780\n and all of these other people,\n\n35:19.780 --> 35:22.620\n including, it's a tender and then eventually Michael.\n\n35:22.620 --> 35:25.260\n And it was just a place where you could think thoughts.\n\n35:25.260 --> 35:29.300\n And it was okay because so long as once every 25 years or so\n\n35:29.300 --> 35:31.780\n somebody invented a transistor, it paid for everything else.\n\n35:31.780 --> 35:34.140\n You could afford to take the risk.\n\n35:34.140 --> 35:36.440\n And then when that all went away,\n\n35:36.440 --> 35:39.380\n it became harder and harder and harder to justify it\n\n35:39.380 --> 35:41.500\n as far as the folks who were very far away were concerned.\n\n35:41.500 --> 35:43.540\n And there was such a fast turnaround\n\n35:43.540 --> 35:46.380\n among mental management on the AT&T side\n\n35:46.380 --> 35:48.340\n that you never had a chance to really build a relationship.\n\n35:48.340 --> 35:49.820\n At least people like us didn't have a chance\n\n35:49.820 --> 35:51.460\n to build a relationship.\n\n35:51.460 --> 35:55.500\n So when the diaspora happened, it was amazing, right?\n\n35:55.500 --> 35:57.660\n Everybody left and I think everybody ended up\n\n35:57.660 --> 36:00.060\n at a great place and made a huge,\n\n36:00.060 --> 36:02.700\n continued to do really good work with machine learning.\n\n36:02.700 --> 36:03.740\n But it was a wonderful place.\n\n36:03.740 --> 36:07.060\n And people will ask me, what's the best job you've ever had?\n\n36:07.060 --> 36:10.220\n And as a professor, anyway, the answer that I would give is\n\n36:11.140 --> 36:16.100\n well, probably Bell Labs in some very real sense.\n\n36:16.100 --> 36:17.640\n And I will never have a job like that again\n\n36:17.640 --> 36:19.380\n because Bell Labs doesn't exist anymore.\n\n36:19.380 --> 36:22.280\n And Microsoft research is great and Google does good stuff.\n\n36:22.280 --> 36:24.180\n And you can pick IBM, you can tell if you want to,\n\n36:24.180 --> 36:25.860\n but Bell Labs was magical.\n\n36:25.860 --> 36:28.020\n It was around for, it was an important time\n\n36:28.020 --> 36:30.540\n and it represents a high watermark\n\n36:30.540 --> 36:32.820\n in basic research in the US.\n\n36:32.820 --> 36:35.380\n Is there something you could say about the physical proximity\n\n36:35.380 --> 36:36.660\n and the chance collisions?\n\n36:36.660 --> 36:39.380\n Like we live in this time of the pandemic\n\n36:39.380 --> 36:43.780\n where everyone is maybe trying to see the silver lining\n\n36:43.780 --> 36:46.940\n and accepting the remote nature of things.\n\n36:46.940 --> 36:50.380\n Is there one of the things that people like faculty\n\n36:50.380 --> 36:55.380\n that I talk to miss is the procrastination.\n\n36:57.020 --> 36:59.980\n Like the chance to make everything is about meetings\n\n36:59.980 --> 37:00.960\n that are supposed to be,\n\n37:00.960 --> 37:04.100\n there's not a chance to just talk about comic book\n\n37:04.100 --> 37:07.180\n or whatever, like go into discussion that's totally pointless.\n\n37:07.180 --> 37:08.180\n So it's funny you say this\n\n37:08.180 --> 37:11.100\n because that's how we met, met, it was exactly that.\n\n37:11.100 --> 37:12.780\n So I'll let Michael say that, but I'll just add one thing\n\n37:12.780 --> 37:16.460\n which is just that research is a social process\n\n37:16.460 --> 37:20.140\n and it helps to have random social interactions\n\n37:20.140 --> 37:21.580\n even if they don't feel social at the time,\n\n37:21.580 --> 37:22.760\n that's how you get things done.\n\n37:22.760 --> 37:25.860\n One of the great things about the AI Lab when I was there,\n\n37:25.860 --> 37:27.900\n I don't quite know what it looks like now\n\n37:27.900 --> 37:28.780\n once they moved buildings,\n\n37:28.780 --> 37:30.860\n but we had entire walls that were whiteboards\n\n37:30.860 --> 37:31.860\n and people would just get up there\n\n37:31.860 --> 37:33.620\n and they were just right and people would walk up\n\n37:33.620 --> 37:34.460\n and you'd have arguments\n\n37:34.460 --> 37:36.120\n and you'd explain things to one another\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:39.600\n and you got so much out of the freedom to do that.\n\n37:39.600 --> 37:42.940\n You had to be okay with people challenging\n\n37:42.940 --> 37:44.460\n every fricking word you said,\n\n37:44.460 --> 37:47.220\n which I would sometimes find deeply irritating,\n\n37:47.220 --> 37:49.620\n but most of the time it was quite useful.\n\n37:49.620 --> 37:52.020\n But the sort of pointlessness and the interaction\n\n37:52.020 --> 37:54.780\n was in some sense the point, at least for me.\n\n37:54.780 --> 37:57.540\n Yeah, I think offline yesterday I mentioned\n\n37:57.540 --> 38:01.660\n Josh Tenenbaum and he's very much, he's a man,\n\n38:01.660 --> 38:06.220\n he's such an inspiration in the childlike way\n\n38:06.220 --> 38:07.820\n that he pulls you in on any topic.\n\n38:07.820 --> 38:10.380\n It doesn't even have to be about machine learning\n\n38:10.380 --> 38:12.860\n or the brain, he'll just pull you in\n\n38:12.860 --> 38:15.900\n to a closest writable surface,\n\n38:15.900 --> 38:18.260\n which is still, you can find whiteboards\n\n38:18.260 --> 38:23.260\n at MIT everywhere, and just like basically cancel\n\n38:23.380 --> 38:25.040\n all meetings and talk for a couple hours\n\n38:25.040 --> 38:28.060\n about some aimless thing and it feels like\n\n38:28.060 --> 38:30.820\n the whole world, the time space continuum kind of warps\n\n38:30.820 --> 38:32.740\n and that becomes the most important thing.\n\n38:32.740 --> 38:36.660\n And then it's just, it's definitely something\n\n38:36.660 --> 38:40.140\n worth missing in this world where everything's remote.\n\n38:40.140 --> 38:42.980\n There's some magic to the physical presence.\n\n38:42.980 --> 38:44.940\n Whenever I wonder myself whether MIT really is\n\n38:44.940 --> 38:48.220\n as great as I remember it, I just go talk to Josh.\n\n38:48.220 --> 38:49.760\n Yeah, you know, that's funny.\n\n38:49.760 --> 38:52.780\n There's a few people in this world that carry\n\n38:52.780 --> 38:56.380\n the best of what particular institutions stand for, right?\n\n38:56.380 --> 38:57.220\n And it's.\n\n38:57.220 --> 38:58.060\n It's Josh.\n\n38:58.060 --> 39:00.980\n I mean, I don't, my guess is he's unaware of this.\n\n39:00.980 --> 39:02.020\n That's the point.\n\n39:02.020 --> 39:02.860\n Yeah.\n\n39:02.860 --> 39:05.720\n That the masters are not aware of their mastery.\n\n39:06.680 --> 39:07.520\n So.\n\n39:07.520 --> 39:09.100\n How did we meet?\n\n39:09.100 --> 39:12.380\n Yes, but first a tangent, no.\n\n39:13.700 --> 39:14.700\n How did you meet me?\n\n39:14.700 --> 39:16.100\n So I'm not sure what you were thinking,\n\n39:16.100 --> 39:19.220\n but when it started to dawn on me\n\n39:19.220 --> 39:21.540\n that maybe we had a longer term bond\n\n39:21.540 --> 39:23.980\n was after we all got laid off.\n\n39:23.980 --> 39:26.620\n And you had decided at that point\n\n39:26.620 --> 39:28.460\n that we were still paid.\n\n39:28.460 --> 39:30.980\n We were given an opportunity to like do a job search\n\n39:30.980 --> 39:32.980\n and kind of make a transition,\n\n39:32.980 --> 39:35.220\n but it was clear that we were done.\n\n39:35.220 --> 39:38.400\n And I would go to my office to work\n\n39:38.400 --> 39:41.340\n and you would go to my office to keep me from working.\n\n39:41.340 --> 39:43.500\n That was my recollection of it.\n\n39:43.500 --> 39:44.580\n You had decided that there was no,\n\n39:44.580 --> 39:46.540\n really no point in working for the company\n\n39:46.540 --> 39:49.720\n because our relationship with the company was done.\n\n39:49.720 --> 39:51.260\n Yeah, but remember I felt that way beforehand.\n\n39:51.260 --> 39:52.180\n It wasn't about the company.\n\n39:52.180 --> 39:53.420\n It was about the set of people there\n\n39:53.420 --> 39:54.260\n doing really cool things.\n\n39:54.260 --> 39:55.780\n And it always, always been that way.\n\n39:55.780 --> 39:57.460\n But we were working on something together.\n\n39:57.460 --> 39:58.300\n Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n39:58.300 --> 39:59.120\n That's right.\n\n39:59.120 --> 40:00.280\n So at the very end, we all got laid off,\n\n40:00.280 --> 40:04.140\n but then our boss came to, our boss's boss came to us\n\n40:04.140 --> 40:05.620\n because our boss was Michael Kearns\n\n40:05.620 --> 40:08.980\n and he had jumped ship brilliantly, like perfect timing.\n\n40:08.980 --> 40:12.060\n Like things like right before the ship was about to sink,\n\n40:12.060 --> 40:16.820\n he was like, gotta go and landed perfectly\n\n40:16.820 --> 40:18.180\n because Michael Kearns.\n\n40:18.180 --> 40:19.020\n Because Michael Kearns.\n\n40:19.020 --> 40:23.580\n And leaving the rest of us to go like, this is fine.\n\n40:23.580 --> 40:25.780\n And then it was clear that it wasn't fine\n\n40:25.780 --> 40:27.440\n and we were all toast.\n\n40:27.440 --> 40:29.220\n So we had this sort of long period of time.\n\n40:29.220 --> 40:30.860\n But then our boss figured out, okay, wait,\n\n40:30.860 --> 40:33.660\n maybe we can save a couple of these people\n\n40:33.660 --> 40:36.400\n if we can have them do something really useful.\n\n40:37.260 --> 40:40.680\n And the useful thing was we were gonna make\n\n40:40.680 --> 40:42.280\n basically an automated assistant\n\n40:42.280 --> 40:43.900\n that could help you with your calendar.\n\n40:43.900 --> 40:45.700\n You could like tell it things\n\n40:45.700 --> 40:47.860\n and it would respond appropriately.\n\n40:47.860 --> 40:49.700\n It would just kind of integrate across\n\n40:49.700 --> 40:53.600\n all sorts of your personal information.\n\n40:53.600 --> 40:56.700\n And so me and Charles and Peter Stone\n\n40:56.700 --> 40:58.880\n were set up as the crack team\n\n40:58.880 --> 41:00.860\n to actually solve this problem.\n\n41:00.860 --> 41:04.220\n Other people maybe were too theoretical that they thought,\n\n41:04.220 --> 41:05.660\n but we could actually get something done.\n\n41:05.660 --> 41:07.260\n So we sat down to get something done\n\n41:07.260 --> 41:10.100\n and there wasn't time and it wouldn't have saved us anyway.\n\n41:10.100 --> 41:12.060\n And so it all kind of went downhill.\n\n41:12.060 --> 41:15.380\n But the interesting, I think, coda to that\n\n41:15.380 --> 41:18.860\n is that our boss's boss is a guy named Ron Brockman.\n\n41:18.860 --> 41:22.100\n And when he left AT&T,\n\n41:22.100 --> 41:23.820\n cause we were all laid off,\n\n41:23.820 --> 41:27.220\n he went to DARPA, started up a program there\n\n41:27.220 --> 41:28.960\n that became KALO,\n\n41:28.960 --> 41:32.100\n which is the program from which Siri sprung,\n\n41:32.100 --> 41:34.060\n which is a digital assistant\n\n41:34.060 --> 41:35.260\n that helps you with your calendar\n\n41:35.260 --> 41:36.660\n and a bunch of other things.\n\n41:37.660 --> 41:40.860\n It really, in some ways got its start\n\n41:40.860 --> 41:44.440\n with me and Charles and Peter trying to implement this vision\n\n41:44.440 --> 41:45.580\n that Ron Brockman had,\n\n41:45.580 --> 41:47.740\n that he ultimately got implemented\n\n41:47.740 --> 41:49.380\n through his role at DARPA.\n\n41:49.380 --> 41:51.380\n So when I'm trying to feel less bad\n\n41:51.380 --> 41:52.420\n about having been laid off\n\n41:52.420 --> 41:56.020\n from what is possibly the greatest job of all time,\n\n41:56.020 --> 42:00.060\n I think about, well, we kind of helped birth Siri.\n\n42:00.060 --> 42:00.960\n That's something.\n\n42:01.860 --> 42:03.120\n And then he did other things too.\n\n42:03.120 --> 42:06.620\n But we got to spend a lot of time in his office\n\n42:06.620 --> 42:07.860\n and talk about lots of things.\n\n42:07.860 --> 42:10.340\n We got to spend a lot of time in my office, yeah.\n\n42:10.340 --> 42:11.180\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n42:11.180 --> 42:13.460\n And so then we went on our merry way.\n\n42:13.460 --> 42:15.340\n Everyone went to different places.\n\n42:15.340 --> 42:16.540\n Charles landed at Georgia Tech,\n\n42:16.540 --> 42:20.300\n which was what he always dreamed he would do.\n\n42:20.300 --> 42:22.680\n And so that worked out well.\n\n42:23.740 --> 42:25.380\n I came up with a saying at the time,\n\n42:25.380 --> 42:27.980\n which is luck favors the Charles.\n\n42:27.980 --> 42:30.540\n It's kind of like luck favors the prepared,\n\n42:30.540 --> 42:32.940\n but Charles, like he wished something\n\n42:32.940 --> 42:35.460\n and then it would basically happen just the way he wanted.\n\n42:35.460 --> 42:38.500\n It was inspirational to see things go that way.\n\n42:38.500 --> 42:39.340\n Things worked out.\n\n42:39.340 --> 42:40.180\n And we stayed in touch.\n\n42:40.180 --> 42:43.740\n And then I think it really helped\n\n42:43.740 --> 42:46.100\n when you were working on,\n\n42:46.100 --> 42:48.300\n I mean, you'd kept me in the loop for things like threads\n\n42:48.300 --> 42:49.780\n and the work that you were doing at Georgia Tech.\n\n42:49.780 --> 42:50.980\n But then when they were starting\n\n42:50.980 --> 42:52.860\n their online master's program,\n\n42:52.860 --> 42:55.020\n he knew that I was really excited about MOOCs\n\n42:55.020 --> 42:56.140\n and online teaching.\n\n42:56.140 --> 42:57.980\n And he's like, I have a plan.\n\n42:57.980 --> 42:58.900\n And I'm like, tell me your plan.\n\n42:58.900 --> 43:00.660\n He's like, I can't tell you the plan yet.\n\n43:00.660 --> 43:02.980\n Cause they were deep in negotiations\n\n43:02.980 --> 43:05.500\n between Georgia Tech and Udacity to make this happen.\n\n43:05.500 --> 43:07.340\n And they didn't want it to leak.\n\n43:07.340 --> 43:09.260\n So Charles would kept teasing me about it,\n\n43:09.260 --> 43:10.740\n but wouldn't tell me what was actually going on.\n\n43:10.740 --> 43:13.020\n And eventually it was announced and he said,\n\n43:13.020 --> 43:15.060\n I would like you to teach the machine learning course\n\n43:15.060 --> 43:15.900\n with me.\n\n43:15.900 --> 43:18.340\n I'm like, that can't possibly work.\n\n43:18.340 --> 43:19.340\n But it was a great idea.\n\n43:19.340 --> 43:20.940\n And it was super fun.\n\n43:20.940 --> 43:22.140\n It was a lot of work to put together,\n\n43:22.140 --> 43:23.980\n but it was really great.\n\n43:23.980 --> 43:26.020\n Was that the first time you thought about,\n\n43:26.020 --> 43:27.680\n first of all, was it the first time\n\n43:27.680 --> 43:30.140\n you got seriously into teaching?\n\n43:30.140 --> 43:32.100\n I mean, I was a professor.\n\n43:32.100 --> 43:35.500\n This was already after you jumped to,\n\n43:35.500 --> 43:38.740\n so like there's a little bit of jumping around in time.\n\n43:38.740 --> 43:39.580\n Yeah, sorry about that.\n\n43:39.580 --> 43:40.500\n There's a pretty big jump in time.\n\n43:40.500 --> 43:42.540\n So like the MOOCs thing.\n\n43:42.540 --> 43:44.260\n So Charles got to Georgia Tech and he,\n\n43:44.260 --> 43:46.060\n I mean, maybe Charles, maybe this is a Charles story.\n\n43:46.060 --> 43:47.060\n I got to Georgia Tech in 2002.\n\n43:47.060 --> 43:49.300\n He got to Georgia Tech in 2002.\n\n43:49.300 --> 43:52.820\n And worked on things like revamping the curriculum,\n\n43:52.820 --> 43:53.780\n the undergraduate curriculum,\n\n43:53.780 --> 43:57.800\n so that it had some kind of semblance of modular structure\n\n43:57.800 --> 44:00.060\n because computer science was at the time\n\n44:00.060 --> 44:03.620\n moving from a fairly narrow specific set of topics\n\n44:03.620 --> 44:08.340\n to touching a lot of other parts of intellectual life.\n\n44:08.340 --> 44:10.860\n And the curriculum was supposed to reflect that.\n\n44:10.860 --> 44:15.480\n And so Charles played a big role in kind of redesigning that.\n\n44:15.480 --> 44:16.320\n And then the.\n\n44:16.320 --> 44:20.660\n And for my labors, I ended up as associate dean.\n\n44:20.660 --> 44:22.420\n Right, he got to become associate dean\n\n44:22.420 --> 44:24.780\n of charge of educational stuff.\n\n44:24.780 --> 44:25.620\n Yeah, I was under.\n\n44:25.620 --> 44:26.700\n This should be a valuable lesson.\n\n44:26.700 --> 44:28.940\n If you're good at something,\n\n44:30.260 --> 44:33.740\n they will give you responsibility to do more of that thing.\n\n44:33.740 --> 44:34.580\n Well.\n\n44:34.580 --> 44:35.400\n Until you.\n\n44:35.400 --> 44:36.240\n Don't show competence.\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:37.260\n Don't show competence if you.\n\n44:37.260 --> 44:38.900\n Don't want responsibility.\n\n44:38.900 --> 44:40.700\n Here's what they say.\n\n44:40.700 --> 44:43.340\n The reward for good work is more work.\n\n44:43.340 --> 44:45.340\n The reward for bad work is less work.\n\n44:47.060 --> 44:48.140\n Which, I don't know.\n\n44:48.140 --> 44:50.080\n Depending on what you're trying to do that week,\n\n44:50.080 --> 44:51.300\n one of those is better than the other.\n\n44:51.300 --> 44:52.820\n Well, one of the problems with the word work,\n\n44:52.820 --> 44:57.580\n sorry to interrupt, is that it seems to be an antonym\n\n44:57.580 --> 44:59.240\n in this particular language.\n\n44:59.240 --> 45:01.780\n We have the opposite of happiness.\n\n45:01.780 --> 45:02.980\n But it seems like they're.\n\n45:02.980 --> 45:07.460\n That's one of, you know, we talked about balance.\n\n45:07.460 --> 45:09.700\n It's always like work life balance.\n\n45:09.700 --> 45:12.940\n It always rubbed me the wrong way as a terminology.\n\n45:12.940 --> 45:13.900\n I know it's just words.\n\n45:13.900 --> 45:15.460\n Right, the opposite of work is play.\n\n45:15.460 --> 45:17.900\n But ideally, work is play.\n\n45:17.900 --> 45:20.340\n Oh, I can't tell you how much time I'd spend.\n\n45:20.340 --> 45:21.780\n Certainly, when I was at Bell Labs,\n\n45:21.780 --> 45:23.740\n except for a few very key moments,\n\n45:23.740 --> 45:25.140\n as a professor, I would do this too.\n\n45:25.140 --> 45:26.200\n I would just say, I cannot believe\n\n45:26.200 --> 45:28.700\n they're paying me to do this.\n\n45:28.700 --> 45:29.520\n Because it's fun.\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:32.140\n It's something that I would do for a hobby\n\n45:32.140 --> 45:34.900\n if I could anyway.\n\n45:34.900 --> 45:35.740\n So that sort of worked out.\n\n45:35.740 --> 45:37.020\n Are you sure you want to be saying that\n\n45:37.020 --> 45:38.860\n when this is being recorded?\n\n45:38.860 --> 45:40.220\n As a dean, that is not true at all.\n\n45:40.220 --> 45:41.060\n I need a raise.\n\n45:42.220 --> 45:43.700\n But I think here with this,\n\n45:43.700 --> 45:45.380\n even though a lot of time passed,\n\n45:45.380 --> 45:47.520\n Mike and I talked almost every, well, we texted,\n\n45:47.520 --> 45:49.860\n almost every day during the period.\n\n45:49.860 --> 45:53.060\n Charles, at one point, took me,\n\n45:53.060 --> 45:55.020\n the ICML conference, the machine learning conference\n\n45:55.020 --> 45:57.320\n was in Atlanta.\n\n45:57.320 --> 46:00.380\n I was the chair, the general chair of the conference.\n\n46:00.380 --> 46:03.380\n Charles was my publicity chair or something like that,\n\n46:03.380 --> 46:05.540\n or fundraising chair.\n\n46:05.540 --> 46:08.020\n Yeah, but he decided it'd be really funny\n\n46:08.020 --> 46:09.660\n if he didn't actually show up for the conference\n\n46:09.660 --> 46:11.660\n in his own home city.\n\n46:11.660 --> 46:13.460\n So he didn't, but he did at one point\n\n46:13.460 --> 46:16.200\n pick me up at the conference in his Tesla\n\n46:16.200 --> 46:19.140\n and drove me to the Atlanta mall\n\n46:19.140 --> 46:22.060\n and forced me to buy an iPhone\n\n46:22.060 --> 46:25.660\n because he didn't like how it was to text with me\n\n46:25.660 --> 46:27.220\n and thought it would be better for him\n\n46:27.220 --> 46:30.380\n if I had an iPhone, the text would be somehow smoother.\n\n46:30.380 --> 46:31.220\n And it was.\n\n46:31.220 --> 46:32.060\n And it was.\n\n46:32.060 --> 46:32.880\n And it is, and his life is better.\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:33.720\n And my life is better.\n\n46:33.720 --> 46:36.340\n And so, yeah, but it was, yeah,\n\n46:36.340 --> 46:38.220\n Charles forced me to get an iPhone\n\n46:38.220 --> 46:40.340\n so that he could text me more efficiently.\n\n46:40.340 --> 46:42.020\n I thought that was an interesting moment.\n\n46:42.020 --> 46:42.840\n It works for me.\n\n46:42.840 --> 46:44.100\n Anyway, so we kept talking the whole time\n\n46:44.100 --> 46:46.340\n and then eventually we did the teaching thing\n\n46:46.340 --> 46:47.180\n and it was great.\n\n46:47.180 --> 46:48.780\n And there's a couple of reasons for that, by the way.\n\n46:48.780 --> 46:51.460\n One is I really wanted to do something different.\n\n46:51.460 --> 46:53.200\n Like you've got this medium here,\n\n46:53.200 --> 46:54.500\n people claim it can change things.\n\n46:54.500 --> 46:56.940\n What's a thing that you could do in this medium\n\n46:56.940 --> 47:00.500\n that you could not do otherwise besides edit, right?\n\n47:00.500 --> 47:01.340\n I mean, what could you do?\n\n47:01.340 --> 47:03.940\n And being able to do something with another person\n\n47:03.940 --> 47:04.780\n was that kind of thing.\n\n47:04.780 --> 47:05.600\n It's very hard.\n\n47:05.600 --> 47:06.440\n I mean, you can take turns,\n\n47:06.440 --> 47:09.020\n but teaching together, having conversations is very hard.\n\n47:09.020 --> 47:10.240\n So that was a cool thing.\n\n47:10.240 --> 47:11.340\n The second thing, give me an excuse\n\n47:11.340 --> 47:12.420\n to do more stuff with him.\n\n47:12.420 --> 47:15.700\n Yeah, I always thought, he makes it sound brilliant.\n\n47:15.700 --> 47:17.200\n And it is, I guess.\n\n47:17.200 --> 47:19.220\n But at the time it really felt like\n\n47:20.120 --> 47:22.720\n I've got a lot to do, Charles is saying,\n\n47:22.720 --> 47:25.740\n and it would be great if Michael could teach the course\n\n47:25.740 --> 47:27.700\n and I could just hang out.\n\n47:27.700 --> 47:29.460\n Yeah, just kind of coast on that.\n\n47:29.460 --> 47:31.540\n Well, that's what the second class was more like that.\n\n47:31.540 --> 47:33.380\n Because the second class was explicitly like that.\n\n47:33.380 --> 47:36.280\n But the first class, it was at least half.\n\n47:36.280 --> 47:37.120\n Yeah, but I do all the stuff.\n\n47:37.120 --> 47:37.940\n So the structure that we came up with.\n\n47:37.940 --> 47:39.940\n I think you're once again letting the facts\n\n47:39.940 --> 47:42.900\n get in the way of a good story.\n\n47:42.900 --> 47:44.700\n I should just let Charles talk to us.\n\n47:44.700 --> 47:46.380\n But that's the facts that he saw.\n\n47:46.380 --> 47:48.540\n So that was kind of true for 7642.\n\n47:48.540 --> 47:50.180\n Yeah, that was sort of true for 7642,\n\n47:50.180 --> 47:51.340\n which is the reinforcement learning class,\n\n47:51.340 --> 47:52.540\n because that was really his class.\n\n47:52.540 --> 47:55.260\n You started with reinforcement learning or machine learning?\n\n47:55.260 --> 47:57.420\n Intro machine learning, 7641,\n\n47:57.420 --> 48:00.300\n which is supervised learning, unsupervised learning,\n\n48:00.300 --> 48:02.140\n and reinforcement learning and decision making,\n\n48:02.140 --> 48:03.060\n cram all that in there,\n\n48:03.060 --> 48:04.860\n the kind of assignments that we talked about earlier.\n\n48:04.860 --> 48:06.540\n And then eventually, about a year later,\n\n48:06.540 --> 48:08.540\n we did a follow on 7642,\n\n48:08.540 --> 48:10.860\n which is reinforcement learning and decision making.\n\n48:10.860 --> 48:12.380\n The first class was based on something\n\n48:12.380 --> 48:14.540\n I'd been teaching at that point for well over a decade.\n\n48:14.540 --> 48:15.940\n And the second class was based on something\n\n48:15.940 --> 48:17.500\n Michael had been teaching.\n\n48:17.500 --> 48:18.860\n Actually, I learned quite a bit\n\n48:18.860 --> 48:21.620\n teaching that class with him, but he drove most of that.\n\n48:21.620 --> 48:23.860\n But the first one I drove most, it was all my material.\n\n48:23.860 --> 48:26.340\n Although I had stolen that material originally\n\n48:26.340 --> 48:28.660\n from slides I found online from Michael,\n\n48:28.660 --> 48:30.540\n who had originally stolen that material\n\n48:30.540 --> 48:32.180\n from, I guess, slides he found online,\n\n48:32.180 --> 48:33.220\n probably from Andrew Moore,\n\n48:33.220 --> 48:34.660\n because the jokes were the same anyway.\n\n48:34.660 --> 48:36.660\n At least some of the, at least when I found the slides,\n\n48:36.660 --> 48:37.500\n some of the stuff with it.\n\n48:37.500 --> 48:38.340\n Is that true?\n\n48:38.340 --> 48:40.540\n Yes, every machine learning class taught in the early 2000s\n\n48:40.540 --> 48:41.900\n stole from Andrew Moore.\n\n48:41.900 --> 48:43.980\n A particular joke or two?\n\n48:43.980 --> 48:44.940\n At least the structure.\n\n48:44.940 --> 48:46.620\n Now, I did, and he did, actually,\n\n48:46.620 --> 48:48.940\n a lot more with reinforcement learning and such,\n\n48:48.940 --> 48:50.380\n and game theory and those kinds of things.\n\n48:50.380 --> 48:51.700\n But, you know, we all sort of built in.\n\n48:51.700 --> 48:52.860\n You mean in the research world?\n\n48:52.860 --> 48:54.060\n No, no, no, in that class.\n\n48:54.060 --> 48:54.900\n No, I mean in teaching that class.\n\n48:54.900 --> 48:57.540\n The coverage was different than what we started.\n\n48:57.540 --> 48:58.980\n Most people were just doing supervised learning\n\n48:58.980 --> 49:01.740\n and maybe a little bit of clustering and whatnot,\n\n49:01.740 --> 49:03.060\n but we took it all the way to machine learning.\n\n49:03.060 --> 49:04.820\n A lot of it just comes from Tom Mitchell's book.\n\n49:04.820 --> 49:06.060\n Oh, no, yeah, except, well,\n\n49:06.060 --> 49:07.940\n half of it comes from Tom Mitchell's book, right?\n\n49:07.940 --> 49:10.020\n I mean, the other half doesn't.\n\n49:10.020 --> 49:12.500\n This is why it's all readings, right?\n\n49:12.500 --> 49:13.500\n Because certain things weren't invented\n\n49:13.500 --> 49:14.340\n when Tom wrote that stuff.\n\n49:14.340 --> 49:15.160\n Yeah, okay, that's true.\n\n49:15.160 --> 49:17.660\n All right, but it was quite good.\n\n49:17.660 --> 49:19.920\n But there's a reason for that besides, you know,\n\n49:19.920 --> 49:21.060\n just, I wanted to do it.\n\n49:21.060 --> 49:21.900\n I wanted to do something new,\n\n49:21.900 --> 49:23.380\n and I wanted to do something with him,\n\n49:23.380 --> 49:24.620\n which is a realization,\n\n49:24.620 --> 49:27.380\n which is despite what you might believe,\n\n49:27.380 --> 49:29.460\n he's an introvert and I'm an introvert,\n\n49:29.460 --> 49:32.140\n or I'm on the edge of being an introvert anyway.\n\n49:32.140 --> 49:36.940\n But both of us, I think, enjoy the energy of the crowd,\n\n49:36.940 --> 49:37.780\n right?\n\n49:37.780 --> 49:39.700\n There's something about talking to people\n\n49:39.700 --> 49:41.940\n and bringing them into whatever we find interesting\n\n49:41.940 --> 49:45.440\n that is empowering, energizing, or whatever.\n\n49:45.440 --> 49:50.440\n And I found the idea of staring alone at a computer screen\n\n49:50.440 --> 49:52.720\n and then talking off of materials\n\n49:52.720 --> 49:55.360\n less inspiring than I wanted it to be.\n\n49:55.360 --> 49:59.200\n And I had in fact done a MOOC for Udacity on algorithms.\n\n49:59.200 --> 50:04.200\n And it was a week in a dark room talking at the screen,\n\n50:05.480 --> 50:07.040\n writing on the little pad.\n\n50:07.040 --> 50:09.320\n And I didn't know this was happening,\n\n50:09.320 --> 50:10.160\n but they had watched,\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:12.460\n the crew had watched some of the videos\n\n50:12.460 --> 50:13.720\n while, you know, like in the middle of this,\n\n50:13.720 --> 50:15.800\n and they're like, something's wrong.\n\n50:15.800 --> 50:19.540\n You're sort of shutting down.\n\n50:19.540 --> 50:22.440\n And I think a lot of it was I'll make jokes\n\n50:22.440 --> 50:24.220\n and no one would laugh.\n\n50:24.220 --> 50:26.480\n And I felt like the crowd hated me.\n\n50:26.480 --> 50:27.800\n Now, of course, there was no crowd.\n\n50:27.800 --> 50:29.960\n So like, it wasn't rational.\n\n50:29.960 --> 50:32.900\n But each time I tried it and I got no reaction,\n\n50:32.900 --> 50:37.280\n it just was taking the energy out of my performance,\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:38.720\n out of my presentation.\n\n50:38.720 --> 50:40.360\n Such a fantastic metaphor for grad school.\n\n50:40.360 --> 50:42.600\n Anyway, by working together,\n\n50:42.600 --> 50:44.600\n we could play off each other and have a good time.\n\n50:44.600 --> 50:45.420\n And keep the energy up,\n\n50:45.420 --> 50:48.480\n because you can't let your guard down for a moment\n\n50:48.480 --> 50:51.080\n with Charles, he'll just overpower you.\n\n50:51.080 --> 50:52.200\n I have no idea what you're talking about.\n\n50:52.200 --> 50:54.040\n But we would work really well together, I thought,\n\n50:54.040 --> 50:54.880\n and we knew each other,\n\n50:54.880 --> 50:56.640\n so I knew that we could sort of make it work.\n\n50:56.640 --> 50:57.720\n Plus, I was the associate dean,\n\n50:57.720 --> 51:00.080\n so they had to do what I told them to do.\n\n51:00.080 --> 51:01.480\n We had to make it work.\n\n51:01.480 --> 51:03.880\n And so it worked out very well, I thought,\n\n51:03.880 --> 51:04.920\n well enough that we.\n\n51:04.920 --> 51:06.560\n With great power comes great power.\n\n51:06.560 --> 51:07.380\n That's right.\n\n51:07.380 --> 51:09.320\n And we became smooth and curly.\n\n51:09.320 --> 51:14.320\n And that's when we did the overfitting thriller video.\n\n51:15.680 --> 51:17.400\n Yeah, that's a thing.\n\n51:17.400 --> 51:20.880\n So can we just, like, smooth and curly,\n\n51:20.880 --> 51:21.720\n where did that come from?\n\n51:21.720 --> 51:23.440\n Okay, so it happened.\n\n51:23.440 --> 51:24.680\n It was completely spontaneous.\n\n51:24.680 --> 51:25.880\n These are nicknames you go by.\n\n51:25.880 --> 51:28.600\n Yeah, so it's what the students call us.\n\n51:28.600 --> 51:30.300\n He was lecturing.\n\n51:30.300 --> 51:32.040\n So the way that we structured the lectures\n\n51:32.040 --> 51:33.400\n is one of us is the lecturer\n\n51:33.400 --> 51:35.360\n and one of us is basically the student.\n\n51:35.360 --> 51:37.440\n And so he was lecturing on.\n\n51:37.440 --> 51:39.040\n The lecturer prepares all the materials,\n\n51:39.040 --> 51:40.440\n comes up with the quizzes,\n\n51:40.440 --> 51:43.120\n and then the student comes in not knowing anything.\n\n51:43.120 --> 51:45.440\n So it was just like being on campus.\n\n51:45.440 --> 51:48.080\n And I was doing game theory in particular,\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:48.900\n the Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n51:48.900 --> 51:49.740\n Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\n51:49.740 --> 51:52.200\n And so he needed to set up a little Prisoner's Dilemma grid.\n\n51:52.200 --> 51:54.320\n So he drew it and I could see what he was drawing.\n\n51:54.320 --> 51:57.520\n And the Prisoner's Dilemma consists of two players,\n\n51:57.520 --> 51:58.360\n two parties.\n\n51:58.360 --> 52:00.120\n So he decided he would make little cartoons\n\n52:00.120 --> 52:01.240\n of the two of us.\n\n52:01.240 --> 52:04.860\n And so there was two criminals, right,\n\n52:04.860 --> 52:07.960\n that were deciding whether or not to rat each other out.\n\n52:07.960 --> 52:11.120\n One of them he drew as a circle with a smiley face\n\n52:11.120 --> 52:14.080\n and a kind of goatee thing, smooth head.\n\n52:14.080 --> 52:16.320\n And the other one with all sorts of curly hair.\n\n52:16.320 --> 52:18.400\n And he said, this is smooth and curly.\n\n52:18.400 --> 52:19.680\n I said, smooth and curly?\n\n52:19.680 --> 52:21.560\n He said, no, no, smooth with a V.\n\n52:21.560 --> 52:23.600\n It's very important that it have a V.\n\n52:23.600 --> 52:27.220\n And then the students really took to that.\n\n52:27.220 --> 52:29.160\n Like they found that relatable.\n\n52:29.160 --> 52:31.200\n He started singing Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson.\n\n52:31.200 --> 52:32.040\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n52:32.040 --> 52:33.560\n And those names stuck.\n\n52:33.560 --> 52:36.320\n So we now have a video series,\n\n52:36.320 --> 52:38.440\n an episode, our kind of first actual episode\n\n52:38.440 --> 52:39.900\n should be coming out today,\n\n52:39.900 --> 52:43.260\n Smooth and Curly on video,\n\n52:43.260 --> 52:47.300\n where the two of us discuss episodes of Westworld.\n\n52:47.300 --> 52:49.360\n We watch Westworld and we're like, huh,\n\n52:49.360 --> 52:51.900\n what does this say about computer science and AI?\n\n52:51.900 --> 52:53.940\n And we've never, we did not watch it.\n\n52:53.940 --> 52:55.760\n I mean, no, it's on season three or whatever we have.\n\n52:55.760 --> 52:57.660\n As of this recording, it's on season three.\n\n52:57.660 --> 52:59.960\n We've watched now two episodes total.\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:01.460\n Yeah, I think I watched three.\n\n53:01.460 --> 53:02.660\n What do you think about Westworld?\n\n53:02.660 --> 53:03.500\n Two episodes in.\n\n53:03.500 --> 53:05.940\n So I can tell you so far,\n\n53:05.940 --> 53:08.160\n I'm just guessing what's gonna happen next.\n\n53:08.160 --> 53:10.180\n It seems like bad things are gonna happen\n\n53:10.180 --> 53:11.260\n with the robots uprising.\n\n53:11.260 --> 53:12.100\n It's a lot of.\n\n53:12.100 --> 53:12.940\n Spoiler alert.\n\n53:12.940 --> 53:13.780\n So I have not, I have not,\n\n53:13.780 --> 53:16.200\n I mean, you know, I vaguely remember a movie existing.\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:18.600\n So I assume it's related to that, but.\n\n53:18.600 --> 53:20.220\n That was more my time than your time, Charles.\n\n53:20.220 --> 53:21.540\n That's right, cause you're much older than I am.\n\n53:21.540 --> 53:24.180\n I think the important thing here is that\n\n53:24.180 --> 53:25.060\n it's narrative, right?\n\n53:25.060 --> 53:26.100\n It's all about telling a story.\n\n53:26.100 --> 53:27.500\n That's the whole driving thing.\n\n53:27.500 --> 53:29.720\n But the idea that they would give these reveries,\n\n53:29.720 --> 53:31.420\n that they would make people,\n\n53:31.420 --> 53:32.260\n they would make them.\n\n53:32.260 --> 53:33.080\n Let them remember.\n\n53:33.080 --> 53:33.920\n Remember the awful things that happened.\n\n53:33.920 --> 53:35.460\n The terrible things that happened.\n\n53:35.460 --> 53:36.860\n Who could possibly think that was gonna,\n\n53:36.860 --> 53:38.380\n I gotta, I mean, I don't know.\n\n53:38.380 --> 53:39.660\n I've only seen the first two episodes\n\n53:39.660 --> 53:40.500\n or maybe the third one.\n\n53:40.500 --> 53:41.320\n I think I've only seen the first one.\n\n53:41.320 --> 53:42.160\n You know what it was?\n\n53:42.160 --> 53:43.000\n You know what the problem is?\n\n53:43.000 --> 53:45.520\n That the robots were actually designed by Hannibal Lecter.\n\n53:45.520 --> 53:46.360\n That's true.\n\n53:46.360 --> 53:47.200\n They weren't.\n\n53:47.200 --> 53:49.580\n So like, what do you think is gonna happen?\n\n53:49.580 --> 53:50.500\n Bad things.\n\n53:50.500 --> 53:51.840\n It's clear that things are happening\n\n53:51.840 --> 53:52.960\n and characters are being introduced\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:54.260\n and we don't yet know anything,\n\n53:54.260 --> 53:57.020\n but still I was just struck by how\n\n53:57.020 --> 53:58.580\n it's all driven by narrative and story.\n\n53:58.580 --> 54:01.260\n And there's all these implied things like programming,\n\n54:01.260 --> 54:03.880\n the programming interface is talking to them\n\n54:03.880 --> 54:05.640\n about what's going on in their heads,\n\n54:05.640 --> 54:08.560\n which is both, I mean, artistically,\n\n54:08.560 --> 54:10.120\n it's probably useful to film it that way.\n\n54:10.120 --> 54:11.540\n But think about how it would work in real life.\n\n54:11.540 --> 54:12.480\n That just seems very great.\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:14.280\n But there was, we saw in the second episode,\n\n54:14.280 --> 54:15.120\n there's a screen.\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:15.940\n You could see things.\n\n54:15.940 --> 54:16.780\n They were wearing like Kubrick's glasses.\n\n54:16.780 --> 54:17.620\n In the world.\n\n54:17.620 --> 54:20.360\n It was quite interesting to just kind of ask this question\n\n54:20.360 --> 54:21.200\n so far.\n\n54:21.200 --> 54:22.940\n I mean, I assume it veers off into Never Never Land\n\n54:22.940 --> 54:23.780\n at some point.\n\n54:23.780 --> 54:24.940\n So we don't know.\n\n54:24.940 --> 54:25.880\n We can't answer that question.\n\n54:25.880 --> 54:28.680\n I'm also a fan of a guy named Alex Garland.\n\n54:28.680 --> 54:30.440\n He's a director of Ex Machina.\n\n54:30.440 --> 54:31.280\n Mm hmm.\n\n54:31.280 --> 54:33.980\n And he is the first,\n\n54:33.980 --> 54:36.100\n I wonder if Kubrick was like this actually,\n\n54:36.100 --> 54:39.260\n is he like studies,\n\n54:39.260 --> 54:41.720\n what would it take to program an AI systems?\n\n54:41.720 --> 54:44.720\n Like he's curious enough to go into that direction.\n\n54:44.720 --> 54:46.420\n On the Westworld side,\n\n54:46.420 --> 54:49.300\n I felt there was more emphasis on the narratives\n\n54:49.300 --> 54:52.360\n than like actually asking like computer science questions.\n\n54:52.360 --> 54:53.200\n Yeah.\n\n54:53.200 --> 54:54.620\n Like, how would you build this?\n\n54:54.620 --> 54:56.940\n How would you, and.\n\n54:56.940 --> 54:57.780\n How would you debug it?\n\n54:57.780 --> 55:00.960\n I still think, to me, that's the key issue.\n\n55:00.960 --> 55:02.280\n They were terrible debuggers.\n\n55:02.280 --> 55:03.120\n Yeah.\n\n55:03.120 --> 55:04.240\n Well, they said specifically,\n\n55:04.240 --> 55:05.880\n so we make a change and we put it out in the world\n\n55:05.880 --> 55:07.800\n and that's bad because something terrible could happen.\n\n55:07.800 --> 55:09.560\n Like if you're putting things out in the world\n\n55:09.560 --> 55:11.100\n and you're not sure whether something terrible\n\n55:11.100 --> 55:13.240\n is going to happen, your process is probably.\n\n55:13.240 --> 55:14.760\n I just feel like there should have been someone\n\n55:14.760 --> 55:17.320\n whose sole job it was to walk around and poke his head in\n\n55:17.320 --> 55:19.160\n and say, what could possibly go wrong?\n\n55:19.160 --> 55:20.660\n Just over and over again.\n\n55:20.660 --> 55:22.080\n I would have loved if there was an,\n\n55:22.080 --> 55:24.800\n and I did watch a lot more and I'm not giving anything away.\n\n55:24.800 --> 55:27.080\n I would have loved it if there was like an episode\n\n55:27.080 --> 55:29.960\n where like the new intern is like debugging\n\n55:29.960 --> 55:32.720\n a new model or something and like it just keeps failing\n\n55:32.720 --> 55:34.160\n and they're like, all right.\n\n55:34.160 --> 55:36.840\n And then it's more turns into like a episode\n\n55:36.840 --> 55:38.320\n of Silicon Valley or something like that.\n\n55:38.320 --> 55:39.320\n Yes.\n\n55:39.320 --> 55:41.960\n Versus like this ominous AI systems\n\n55:41.960 --> 55:45.640\n that are constantly like threatening the fabric\n\n55:45.640 --> 55:47.320\n of this world that's been created.\n\n55:47.320 --> 55:48.160\n Yeah.\n\n55:48.160 --> 55:49.360\n Yeah, and you know the other,\n\n55:49.360 --> 55:51.160\n this reminds me of something that,\n\n55:51.160 --> 55:52.600\n so I agree that that should be very cool,\n\n55:52.600 --> 55:54.760\n at least for the small percentage of people\n\n55:54.760 --> 55:56.680\n who care about debugging systems.\n\n55:56.680 --> 55:57.520\n But the other thing is.\n\n55:57.520 --> 55:59.000\n Right, debugging, the series.\n\n55:59.000 --> 56:01.400\n Yeah, it falls into, think of the sequels,\n\n56:01.400 --> 56:02.240\n fear of the debugger.\n\n56:02.240 --> 56:03.400\n Oh my gosh.\n\n56:03.400 --> 56:04.240\n Anyway, so.\n\n56:04.240 --> 56:07.400\n It's a nightmare show, it's a horror movie.\n\n56:07.400 --> 56:08.880\n I think that's where we lose people, by the way,\n\n56:08.880 --> 56:10.660\n early on is the people who either decide,\n\n56:10.660 --> 56:12.800\n either figure out debugging or think debugging is terrible.\n\n56:12.800 --> 56:14.800\n This is where we lose people in computer science.\n\n56:14.800 --> 56:17.000\n This is a part of the struggle versus suffering, right?\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:19.560\n You get through it and you kind of get the skills of it,\n\n56:19.560 --> 56:20.880\n or you're just like, this is dumb,\n\n56:20.880 --> 56:22.040\n and this is a dumb way to do anything.\n\n56:22.040 --> 56:23.480\n And I think that's when we lose people.\n\n56:23.480 --> 56:26.680\n But, well, I'll leave it at that.\n\n56:26.680 --> 56:33.040\n But I think that there's something really, really neat\n\n56:33.040 --> 56:34.160\n about framing it that way.\n\n56:34.160 --> 56:37.600\n But what I don't like about all of these things,\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:39.000\n and I love Tex Machina, by the way,\n\n56:39.000 --> 56:41.300\n although the ending was very depressing.\n\n56:42.940 --> 56:46.320\n One of the things I have to talk to Alex about,\n\n56:46.320 --> 56:49.920\n he says that the thing that nobody noticed he put in\n\n56:49.920 --> 56:53.880\n is at the end, spoiler alert,\n\n56:53.880 --> 57:00.160\n the robot turns and looks at the camera and smiles, briefly.\n\n57:00.160 --> 57:04.680\n And to him, he thought that his definition\n\n57:04.680 --> 57:08.480\n of passing the general version of the Turing test,\n\n57:08.480 --> 57:12.420\n or the consciousness test, is smiling for no one.\n\n57:17.960 --> 57:20.520\n It's like the Chinese room kind of experiment.\n\n57:20.520 --> 57:22.760\n It's not always trying to act for others,\n\n57:22.760 --> 57:26.280\n but just on your own, being able to have a relationship\n\n57:26.280 --> 57:29.840\n with the actual experience and just take it in.\n\n57:29.840 --> 57:32.720\n I don't know, he said nobody noticed the magic of it.\n\n57:32.720 --> 57:35.000\n I have this vague feeling that I remember the smile,\n\n57:35.000 --> 57:37.080\n but now you've just put the memory in my head,\n\n57:37.080 --> 57:38.120\n so probably not.\n\n57:38.120 --> 57:40.120\n But I do think that that's interesting.\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:41.920\n Although, by looking at the camera,\n\n57:41.920 --> 57:43.600\n you are smiling for the audience, right?\n\n57:43.600 --> 57:44.920\n You're breaking the fourth wall.\n\n57:44.920 --> 57:48.160\n It seems, I mean, well, that's a limitation of the medium.\n\n57:48.160 --> 57:49.600\n But I like that idea.\n\n57:49.600 --> 57:51.480\n But here's the problem I have with all of those movies,\n\n57:51.480 --> 57:54.720\n all of them, is that, but I know why it's this way,\n\n57:54.720 --> 57:57.480\n and I enjoy those movies, and Westworld,\n\n57:57.480 --> 58:02.480\n is it sets up the problem of AI as succeeding\n\n58:02.960 --> 58:05.400\n and then having something we cannot control.\n\n58:05.400 --> 58:08.400\n But it's not the bad part of AI.\n\n58:08.400 --> 58:10.020\n The bad part of AI is the stuff\n\n58:10.020 --> 58:11.120\n we're living through now, right?\n\n58:11.120 --> 58:13.740\n It's using the data to make decisions that are terrible.\n\n58:13.740 --> 58:15.840\n It's not the intelligence that's gonna go out there\n\n58:15.840 --> 58:17.960\n and surpass us and take over the world\n\n58:17.960 --> 58:21.640\n or lock us into a room to starve to death slowly\n\n58:21.640 --> 58:22.680\n over multiple days.\n\n58:22.680 --> 58:26.140\n It's instead the tools that we're building\n\n58:26.140 --> 58:30.320\n that are allowing us to make the terrible decisions\n\n58:30.320 --> 58:32.960\n we would have less efficiently made before, right?\n\n58:32.960 --> 58:35.680\n Computers are very good at making us more efficient,\n\n58:35.680 --> 58:38.160\n including being more efficient at doing terrible things.\n\n58:38.160 --> 58:40.220\n And that's the part of the AI we have to worry about.\n\n58:40.220 --> 58:44.040\n It's not the true intelligence that we're gonna build\n\n58:44.040 --> 58:48.080\n sometime in the future, probably long after we're around.\n\n58:48.080 --> 58:52.120\n But I think that whole framing of it\n\n58:52.120 --> 58:55.960\n sort of misses the point, even though it is inspiring.\n\n58:55.960 --> 58:57.760\n And I was inspired by those ideas, right?\n\n58:57.760 --> 58:59.040\n I got into this in part\n\n58:59.040 --> 59:00.800\n because I wanted to build something like that.\n\n59:00.800 --> 59:02.800\n Philosophical questions are interesting to me,\n\n59:02.800 --> 59:04.760\n but that's not where the terror comes from.\n\n59:04.760 --> 59:06.160\n The terror comes from the everyday.\n\n59:06.160 --> 59:08.320\n And you can construct situations\n\n59:08.320 --> 59:11.720\n in the subtlety of the interaction between AI and the human,\n\n59:11.720 --> 59:14.120\n like with social networks,\n\n59:14.120 --> 59:15.160\n all the stuff you're doing\n\n59:15.160 --> 59:17.800\n with interactive artificial intelligence.\n\n59:17.800 --> 59:22.600\n But I feel like Cal 9000 came a little bit closer to that\n\n59:22.600 --> 59:24.400\n in 2001 Space Odyssey,\n\n59:24.400 --> 59:29.000\n because it felt like a personal assistant.\n\n59:29.000 --> 59:31.360\n It felt like closer to the AI systems we have today.\n\n59:31.360 --> 59:35.880\n And the real things we might actually encounter,\n\n59:35.880 --> 59:40.880\n which is over relying in some fundamental way\n\n59:40.880 --> 59:44.860\n on our dumb assistants or on social networks,\n\n59:44.860 --> 59:47.220\n like over offloading too much of us\n\n59:47.220 --> 59:52.220\n onto things that require internet and power and so on\n\n59:55.100 --> 59:59.580\n and thereby becoming powerless as a standalone entity.\n\n59:59.580 --> 1:00:02.300\n And then when that thing starts to misbehave\n\n1:00:02.300 --> 1:00:05.620\n in some subtle way, it creates a lot of problems.\n\n1:00:05.620 --> 1:00:08.460\n And those problems are dramatized when you're in space,\n\n1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:11.340\n because you don't have a way to walk away.\n\n1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:12.820\n Well, as the man said,\n\n1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:15.300\n once we started making the decisions for you,\n\n1:00:15.300 --> 1:00:17.220\n it stopped being your world, right?\n\n1:00:17.220 --> 1:00:20.420\n That's the matrix, Michael, in case you don't remember.\n\n1:00:20.420 --> 1:00:23.180\n But on the other hand, I could say no,\n\n1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:25.620\n because isn't that what we do with people anyway?\n\n1:00:25.620 --> 1:00:27.120\n You know, just kind of the shared intelligence\n\n1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:30.220\n that is humanity is relying on other people constantly.\n\n1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:32.340\n I mean, we hyper specialize, right?\n\n1:00:32.340 --> 1:00:34.620\n As individuals, we're still generally intelligent.\n\n1:00:34.620 --> 1:00:36.040\n We make our own decisions in a lot of ways,\n\n1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:37.620\n but we leave most of this up to other people.\n\n1:00:37.620 --> 1:00:39.860\n And that's perfectly fine.\n\n1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:43.220\n And by the way, everyone doesn't necessarily share our goals.\n\n1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:45.100\n Sometimes they seem to be quite against us.\n\n1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:47.900\n Sometimes we make decisions that others would see\n\n1:00:47.900 --> 1:00:49.080\n as against our own interests.\n\n1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:51.340\n And yet we somehow manage it, manage to survive.\n\n1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:54.240\n I'm not entirely sure why an AI\n\n1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:59.240\n would actually make that worse or even different, really.\n\n1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:02.140\n You mentioned the matrix.\n\n1:01:02.140 --> 1:01:04.420\n Do you think we're living in a simulation?\n\n1:01:04.420 --> 1:01:08.060\n It does feel like a thought game\n\n1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:10.740\n more than a real scientific question.\n\n1:01:10.740 --> 1:01:12.140\n Well, I'll tell you why I think\n\n1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:13.500\n it's an interesting thought experiment.\n\n1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:14.340\n Let's see what you think.\n\n1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:16.140\n From a computer science perspective,\n\n1:01:16.140 --> 1:01:20.180\n it's a good experiment of how difficult would it be\n\n1:01:20.180 --> 1:01:22.860\n to create a sufficiently realistic world\n\n1:01:22.860 --> 1:01:25.000\n that us humans would enjoy being in.\n\n1:01:26.700 --> 1:01:27.660\n That's almost like a competition.\n\n1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:29.100\n If we're living in a simulation,\n\n1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:31.600\n then I don't believe that we were put in the simulation.\n\n1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:34.180\n I believe that it's just physics playing out\n\n1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:36.400\n and we came out of that.\n\n1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.220\n Like, I don't think.\n\n1:01:39.220 --> 1:01:40.900\n So you think you have to build the universe\n\n1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:41.740\n and have all the fun in the world?\n\n1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:42.560\n I think that the universe itself,\n\n1:01:42.560 --> 1:01:43.820\n we can think of that as a simulation.\n\n1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:46.820\n And in fact, sometimes I try to think about,\n\n1:01:46.820 --> 1:01:49.560\n to understand what it's like for a computer\n\n1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:52.660\n to start to think about the world.\n\n1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:55.060\n I try to think about the world.\n\n1:01:55.060 --> 1:01:56.780\n Things like quantum mechanics,\n\n1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:59.940\n where it doesn't feel very natural to me at all.\n\n1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:02.840\n And it really strikes me as,\n\n1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:05.220\n I don't understand this thing that we're living in.\n\n1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:07.620\n It has, there's weird things happening in it\n\n1:02:07.620 --> 1:02:09.660\n that don't feel natural to me at all.\n\n1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:13.060\n Now, if you want to call that as the result of a simulator,\n\n1:02:13.060 --> 1:02:14.280\n okay, I'm fine with that.\n\n1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:15.120\n But like, I don't.\n\n1:02:15.120 --> 1:02:16.940\n There's the bugs in the simulation.\n\n1:02:16.940 --> 1:02:17.780\n There's the bugs.\n\n1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:19.540\n I mean, the interesting thing about the simulation\n\n1:02:19.540 --> 1:02:21.260\n is that it might have bugs.\n\n1:02:21.260 --> 1:02:23.060\n I mean, that's the thing that I,\n\n1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:25.540\n But there would be bugs for the people in the simulation.\n\n1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:27.100\n That's just reality.\n\n1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:29.300\n Unless you were aware enough to know that there was a bug.\n\n1:02:29.300 --> 1:02:30.300\n But I think.\n\n1:02:30.300 --> 1:02:31.420\n Back to the matrix.\n\n1:02:31.420 --> 1:02:32.260\n Yeah, the way you put the question though.\n\n1:02:32.260 --> 1:02:35.300\n I don't think that we live in a simulation created for us.\n\n1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:36.340\n Okay, I would say that.\n\n1:02:36.340 --> 1:02:37.180\n I think that's interesting.\n\n1:02:37.180 --> 1:02:38.100\n I've actually never thought about it that way.\n\n1:02:38.100 --> 1:02:40.140\n I mean, the way you asked the question though,\n\n1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:43.020\n could you create a world that is enough for us humans?\n\n1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:45.460\n It's an interestingly sort of self referential question\n\n1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:49.920\n because the beings that created the simulation\n\n1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:51.460\n probably have not created the simulation\n\n1:02:51.460 --> 1:02:53.300\n that's realistic for them.\n\n1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:56.180\n But we're in the simulation and so it's realistic for us.\n\n1:02:56.180 --> 1:02:58.220\n So we could create a simulation\n\n1:02:58.220 --> 1:03:02.140\n that is fine for the people in the simulation, as it were.\n\n1:03:02.140 --> 1:03:03.660\n That would not necessarily be fine for us\n\n1:03:03.660 --> 1:03:05.140\n as the creators of the simulation.\n\n1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:07.460\n But, well, you can forget.\n\n1:03:07.460 --> 1:03:11.320\n I mean, if you play video games in virtual reality,\n\n1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:15.460\n you can, if some suspension of disbelief or whatever.\n\n1:03:16.340 --> 1:03:17.420\n It becomes a world.\n\n1:03:17.420 --> 1:03:18.500\n It becomes a world.\n\n1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:20.100\n Even like in brief moments,\n\n1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:22.300\n you forget that another world exists.\n\n1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:24.220\n I mean, that's what like good stories do.\n\n1:03:24.220 --> 1:03:25.060\n They pull you in.\n\n1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:28.440\n And the question is, is it possible to pull,\n\n1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:29.380\n our brains are limited.\n\n1:03:29.380 --> 1:03:31.280\n Is it possible to pull the brain in\n\n1:03:31.280 --> 1:03:32.700\n to where we actually stay in that world\n\n1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:34.780\n longer and longer and longer and longer?\n\n1:03:34.780 --> 1:03:39.000\n And like, not only that, but we don't wanna leave.\n\n1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.500\n And so, especially this is the key thing\n\n1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.860\n about the developing brain,\n\n1:03:43.860 --> 1:03:48.140\n is if we journey into that world early on in life, often.\n\n1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.740\n How would you even know, yeah.\n\n1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:53.200\n Yeah, so I, but like from a video game design perspective,\n\n1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:54.420\n from a Westworld perspective,\n\n1:03:54.420 --> 1:03:57.540\n it's, I think it's an important thing\n\n1:03:57.540 --> 1:04:00.820\n for even computer scientists to think about\n\n1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:04.580\n because it's clear that video games are getting much better.\n\n1:04:04.580 --> 1:04:06.500\n And virtual reality,\n\n1:04:06.500 --> 1:04:08.460\n although it's been ups and downs\n\n1:04:08.460 --> 1:04:09.860\n just like artificial intelligence,\n\n1:04:09.860 --> 1:04:14.780\n it feels like virtual reality will be here\n\n1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:16.340\n in a very impressive form\n\n1:04:16.340 --> 1:04:19.060\n if we were to fast forward 100 years into the future\n\n1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:22.100\n in a way that might change society fundamentally.\n\n1:04:22.100 --> 1:04:23.180\n Like if I were to,\n\n1:04:23.180 --> 1:04:26.540\n I'm very limited in predicting the future as all of us are,\n\n1:04:26.540 --> 1:04:28.620\n but if I were to try to predict,\n\n1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:32.540\n like in which way I'd be surprised\n\n1:04:32.540 --> 1:04:35.780\n to see the world 100 years from now,\n\n1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:39.540\n it'd be that, or impressed,\n\n1:04:39.540 --> 1:04:42.280\n it'd be that we're all no longer living\n\n1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.340\n in this physical world,\n\n1:04:43.340 --> 1:04:45.020\n that we're all living in a virtual world.\n\n1:04:45.020 --> 1:04:49.040\n You really need to read Calculating God by Sawyer.\n\n1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:53.080\n It's a, he'll read it in the night.\n\n1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.300\n It's a very easy read,\n\n1:04:54.300 --> 1:04:56.180\n but it's, assuming you're that kind of reader,\n\n1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:58.380\n but it's a good story.\n\n1:04:58.380 --> 1:04:59.680\n And it's kind of about this,\n\n1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:01.420\n but not in a way that it appears.\n\n1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:05.860\n And I really enjoyed the thought experiment.\n\n1:05:07.020 --> 1:05:08.260\n And I think it's pretty sure it's Robert Sawyer.\n\n1:05:08.260 --> 1:05:10.140\n But anyway, he's apparently\n\n1:05:10.140 --> 1:05:12.420\n Canadian's top science fiction writer,\n\n1:05:12.420 --> 1:05:14.980\n which is why the story mostly takes place in Toronto.\n\n1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:18.520\n But it's a very good sort of story\n\n1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:21.260\n that sort of imagines this.\n\n1:05:21.260 --> 1:05:25.020\n Very different kind of simulation hypothesis sort of thing\n\n1:05:25.020 --> 1:05:28.340\n from say, The Egg, for example.\n\n1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:30.540\n You know, I'm talking about the short story.\n\n1:05:32.140 --> 1:05:33.740\n By the guy who did The Martian.\n\n1:05:34.900 --> 1:05:36.300\n Who wrote The Martian?\n\n1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:37.140\n You know what I'm talking about.\n\n1:05:37.140 --> 1:05:38.980\n The Martian. Matt Damon.\n\n1:05:38.980 --> 1:05:39.820\n The book.\n\n1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:41.500\n So we had this whole discussion\n\n1:05:41.500 --> 1:05:45.740\n that Michael doesn't partake in this exercise of reading.\n\n1:05:45.740 --> 1:05:46.780\n He doesn't seem to like it,\n\n1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:48.120\n which seems very strange to me,\n\n1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:50.020\n considering how much he has to read.\n\n1:05:50.020 --> 1:05:50.980\n I read all the time.\n\n1:05:50.980 --> 1:05:53.340\n I used to read 10 books every week\n\n1:05:53.340 --> 1:05:55.260\n when I was in sixth grade or whatever.\n\n1:05:55.260 --> 1:05:57.040\n I was, a lot of it's science fiction,\n\n1:05:57.040 --> 1:05:59.940\n a lot of it's history, but I love to read.\n\n1:05:59.940 --> 1:06:01.740\n But anyway, you should read Calculating God.\n\n1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:04.980\n I think you'll, it's very easy to read, like I said,\n\n1:06:04.980 --> 1:06:08.660\n and I think you'll enjoy sort of the ideas that it presents.\n\n1:06:08.660 --> 1:06:11.500\n Yeah, I think the thought experiment is quite interesting.\n\n1:06:12.740 --> 1:06:15.660\n One thing I've noticed about people growing up now,\n\n1:06:15.660 --> 1:06:17.240\n I mean, we talk about social media,\n\n1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:19.580\n but video games is a much bigger,\n\n1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:21.700\n bigger and bigger and bigger part of their lives.\n\n1:06:21.700 --> 1:06:24.180\n And the video games have become much more realistic.\n\n1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:29.180\n I think it's possible that the three of us are not,\n\n1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.420\n maybe the two of you are not familiar exactly\n\n1:06:33.420 --> 1:06:36.060\n with the numbers we're talking about here.\n\n1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:37.140\n The number of people.\n\n1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:38.460\n It's bigger than movies, right?\n\n1:06:38.460 --> 1:06:39.900\n It's huge.\n\n1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:42.900\n I used to do a lot of the computational narrative stuff.\n\n1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:45.660\n I understand that economists can actually see\n\n1:06:45.660 --> 1:06:48.700\n the impact of video games on the labor market.\n\n1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:53.700\n That there's fewer young men of a certain age\n\n1:06:54.460 --> 1:06:59.260\n participating in like paying jobs than you'd expect.\n\n1:06:59.260 --> 1:07:01.300\n And that they trace it back to video games.\n\n1:07:01.300 --> 1:07:02.900\n I mean, the problem with Star Trek\n\n1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:06.320\n was not warp drive or teleportation.\n\n1:07:06.320 --> 1:07:07.980\n It was the holodeck.\n\n1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:12.020\n Like if you have the holodeck, that's it.\n\n1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:13.580\n That's it, you go in the holodeck, you never come out.\n\n1:07:13.580 --> 1:07:16.860\n I mean, it just never made, once I saw that,\n\n1:07:16.860 --> 1:07:19.260\n I thought, okay, well, so this is the end of humanity\n\n1:07:19.260 --> 1:07:20.100\n as we know it, right?\n\n1:07:20.100 --> 1:07:21.700\n They've invented the holodeck.\n\n1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:23.140\n Because that feels like the singularity,\n\n1:07:23.140 --> 1:07:25.020\n not some AGI or whatever.\n\n1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:28.140\n It's some possibility to go into another world\n\n1:07:28.140 --> 1:07:31.020\n that can be artificially made better than this one.\n\n1:07:32.380 --> 1:07:34.140\n And slowing it down so you live forever.\n\n1:07:34.140 --> 1:07:35.700\n Or speeding it up so you appear to live forever.\n\n1:07:35.700 --> 1:07:37.980\n Or making the decision of when to die.\n\n1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:42.300\n And then most of us will just be old people on the porch\n\n1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:47.300\n yelling at the kids these days in their virtual reality.\n\n1:07:47.300 --> 1:07:49.860\n But they won't hear us because they've got headphones on.\n\n1:07:49.860 --> 1:07:53.540\n So, I mean, rewinding back to Mook's,\n\n1:07:53.540 --> 1:07:57.420\n is there lessons that you've, speaking to kids these days?\n\n1:07:58.660 --> 1:07:59.500\n That was a transition.\n\n1:07:59.500 --> 1:08:01.860\n That was fantastic.\n\n1:08:01.860 --> 1:08:03.240\n I'll fix it in post.\n\n1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:06.400\n That's Charles's favorite phrase.\n\n1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:07.240\n Fix it in post?\n\n1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:08.060\n Fix it in post.\n\n1:08:08.060 --> 1:08:08.900\n Fix it in post.\n\n1:08:08.900 --> 1:08:10.600\n When we were recording all the time,\n\n1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.900\n whenever the editor didn't like something or whatever,\n\n1:08:12.900 --> 1:08:14.420\n I would say, we'll fix it in post.\n\n1:08:14.420 --> 1:08:15.860\n He hated that.\n\n1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:16.860\n He hated that more than anything.\n\n1:08:16.860 --> 1:08:17.980\n Because it's Charles's way of saying,\n\n1:08:17.980 --> 1:08:19.380\n I'm not gonna do it again.\n\n1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:22.300\n You're on your own for this one.\n\n1:08:22.300 --> 1:08:24.060\n But it always got fixed in post.\n\n1:08:24.060 --> 1:08:24.880\n Exactly right.\n\n1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:28.340\n So is there something you've learned about,\n\n1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:29.820\n I mean, it's interesting to talk about Mook's.\n\n1:08:29.820 --> 1:08:30.700\n Is there something you've learned\n\n1:08:30.700 --> 1:08:32.140\n about the process of education,\n\n1:08:32.140 --> 1:08:35.820\n about thinking about the present?\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:38.780\n I think there's two lines of conversation to be had here.\n\n1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:41.540\n There's the future of education in general\n\n1:08:41.540 --> 1:08:42.820\n that you've learned about.\n\n1:08:42.820 --> 1:08:47.820\n And more passionately is the education\n\n1:08:49.060 --> 1:08:50.420\n in the times of COVID.\n\n1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:51.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:51.260 --> 1:08:54.020\n The second thing in some ways matters more than the first,\n\n1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:55.860\n for at least in my head,\n\n1:08:55.860 --> 1:08:57.060\n not just because it's happening now,\n\n1:08:57.060 --> 1:09:00.620\n but because I think it's reminded us of a lot of things.\n\n1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:02.920\n Coincidentally, today, there's an article out\n\n1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:04.560\n by a good friend of mine,\n\n1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:06.120\n who's also a professor at Georgia Tech,\n\n1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:07.900\n but more importantly, a writer and editor\n\n1:09:07.900 --> 1:09:10.740\n at the Atlantic, a guy named Ian Bogost.\n\n1:09:10.740 --> 1:09:13.060\n And the title is something like,\n\n1:09:13.060 --> 1:09:15.380\n Americans Will Sacrifice Anything\n\n1:09:15.380 --> 1:09:17.500\n for the College Experience.\n\n1:09:17.500 --> 1:09:20.300\n And it's about why we went back to college\n\n1:09:20.300 --> 1:09:22.420\n and why people wanted us to go back to college.\n\n1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:24.580\n And it's not greedy presidents\n\n1:09:24.580 --> 1:09:26.300\n trying to get the last dollar from someone.\n\n1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:28.000\n It's because they want to go to college.\n\n1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.880\n And what they're paying for is not the classes.\n\n1:09:29.880 --> 1:09:32.200\n What they're paying for is the college experience.\n\n1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:33.580\n It's not the education that's being there.\n\n1:09:33.580 --> 1:09:35.580\n I've believed this for a long time,\n\n1:09:35.580 --> 1:09:39.080\n that we continually make this mistake of,\n\n1:09:39.080 --> 1:09:40.660\n people want to go back to college\n\n1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:42.340\n as being people want to go back to class.\n\n1:09:42.340 --> 1:09:43.180\n They don't.\n\n1:09:43.180 --> 1:09:44.000\n They want to go back to campus.\n\n1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:44.840\n They want to move away from home.\n\n1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:47.240\n They want to do all those things that people experience.\n\n1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.140\n It's a rite of passage.\n\n1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:53.140\n It's an identity, if I can steal some of Ian's words here.\n\n1:09:53.740 --> 1:09:54.760\n And I think that's right.\n\n1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:57.140\n And I think what we've learned through COVID\n\n1:09:57.140 --> 1:09:59.780\n is it has made it,\n\n1:09:59.780 --> 1:10:02.300\n the disaggregation was not the disaggregation\n\n1:10:02.300 --> 1:10:05.140\n of the education from the place, the university place,\n\n1:10:05.140 --> 1:10:07.080\n and that you can get the best anywhere you want to.\n\n1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:08.100\n Turns out there's lots of reasons\n\n1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:10.220\n why that is not necessarily true.\n\n1:10:10.220 --> 1:10:13.220\n The disaggregation is having it shoved in our faces\n\n1:10:13.220 --> 1:10:14.960\n that the reason to go, again,\n\n1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.700\n that the reason to go to college\n\n1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:18.280\n is not necessarily to learn.\n\n1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:20.180\n It's to have the college experience.\n\n1:10:20.180 --> 1:10:21.780\n And that's very difficult for us to accept,\n\n1:10:21.780 --> 1:10:23.820\n even though we behave that way,\n\n1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:25.620\n most of us, when we were undergrads.\n\n1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:28.740\n A lot of us didn't go to every single class.\n\n1:10:28.740 --> 1:10:30.660\n We learned and we got it and we look back on it\n\n1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:32.320\n and we're happy we had the learning experience as well,\n\n1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:33.420\n obviously, particularly us,\n\n1:10:33.420 --> 1:10:35.380\n because this is the kind of thing that we do.\n\n1:10:35.380 --> 1:10:36.860\n And my guess is that's true\n\n1:10:36.860 --> 1:10:39.380\n of the vast majority of your audience.\n\n1:10:39.380 --> 1:10:41.600\n But that doesn't mean the,\n\n1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:43.380\n I'm standing in front of you telling you this,\n\n1:10:43.380 --> 1:10:47.380\n is the thing that people are excited about.\n\n1:10:47.380 --> 1:10:49.060\n And that's why they want to be there,\n\n1:10:49.060 --> 1:10:50.860\n primarily why they want to be there.\n\n1:10:50.860 --> 1:10:54.380\n So to me, that's what COVID has forced us to deal with,\n\n1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:57.020\n even though I think we're still all in deep denial about it\n\n1:10:57.020 --> 1:10:59.900\n and hoping that it'll go back to that.\n\n1:10:59.900 --> 1:11:01.520\n And I think about 85% of it will.\n\n1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:02.360\n We'll be able to pretend\n\n1:11:02.360 --> 1:11:03.620\n that that's really the way it is, again,\n\n1:11:03.620 --> 1:11:05.340\n and we'll forget the lessons of this.\n\n1:11:05.340 --> 1:11:07.500\n But technically what'll come out of it,\n\n1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:09.060\n or technologically what'll come out of it\n\n1:11:09.060 --> 1:11:12.700\n is a way of providing a more dispersed experience\n\n1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:13.820\n through online education\n\n1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:16.020\n and these kinds of remote things that we've learned.\n\n1:11:16.020 --> 1:11:19.060\n And we'll have to come up with new ways to engage them\n\n1:11:19.060 --> 1:11:20.540\n in the experience of college,\n\n1:11:20.540 --> 1:11:22.060\n which includes not just the parties\n\n1:11:22.060 --> 1:11:23.580\n or the whatever kids do,\n\n1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:25.460\n but the learning part of it\n\n1:11:25.460 --> 1:11:27.060\n so that they actually come out four or five\n\n1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:30.900\n or six years later with having actually learned something.\n\n1:11:30.900 --> 1:11:32.700\n So I think the world\n\n1:11:32.700 --> 1:11:34.080\n will be radically different afterwards.\n\n1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.200\n And I think technology will matter for that,\n\n1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.460\n just not in the way that the people\n\n1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:40.700\n who were building the technology originally\n\n1:11:40.700 --> 1:11:42.120\n imagined it would be.\n\n1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:45.260\n And I think this would have been true even without COVID,\n\n1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:47.840\n but COVID has accelerated that reality.\n\n1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:50.200\n So it's happening in two or three years or five years,\n\n1:11:50.200 --> 1:11:52.180\n as opposed to 10 or 15.\n\n1:11:52.180 --> 1:11:56.180\n That was an amazing answer that I did not understand.\n\n1:11:56.180 --> 1:11:58.180\n It was passionate and meaningful.\n\n1:11:58.180 --> 1:11:59.180\n Shots fired.\n\n1:11:59.180 --> 1:12:00.380\n But I don't, no, I just didn't,\n\n1:12:00.380 --> 1:12:01.420\n no, I'm not trying to criticize it.\n\n1:12:01.420 --> 1:12:03.220\n I just think, I don't think I'm getting it.\n\n1:12:03.220 --> 1:12:05.420\n So you mentioned disaggregation.\n\n1:12:05.420 --> 1:12:06.380\n So what's that?\n\n1:12:06.380 --> 1:12:09.480\n Well, so the power of technology\n\n1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:11.580\n that if you go on the West Coast and hang out long enough\n\n1:12:11.580 --> 1:12:13.580\n is all about we're gonna disaggregate these things together.\n\n1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:15.900\n The books from the bookstore, that kind of a thing.\n\n1:12:15.900 --> 1:12:17.820\n And then suddenly Amazon controls the universe, right?\n\n1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:19.460\n And technology is a disruptor, right?\n\n1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:20.820\n And people have been predicting that\n\n1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:22.860\n for higher education for a long time,\n\n1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:23.700\n but certainly in the age of moves.\n\n1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:25.660\n So is this the sort of idea like\n\n1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:30.120\n students can aggregate on a campus someplace\n\n1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:33.500\n and then take classes over the network anywhere?\n\n1:12:33.500 --> 1:12:34.900\n Yeah, this is what people thought was gonna happen,\n\n1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:37.060\n or at least people claimed it was gonna happen, right?\n\n1:12:37.060 --> 1:12:38.940\n Because my daughter is essentially doing that now.\n\n1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:41.060\n She's on one campus, but learning in a different campus.\n\n1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:43.580\n Sure, and COVID makes that possible, right?\n\n1:12:43.580 --> 1:12:47.540\n COVID makes that legal, all but avoidable, right?\n\n1:12:47.540 --> 1:12:49.480\n But the idea originally was that,\n\n1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:51.180\n you and I were gonna create this machine learning class\n\n1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:52.020\n and it was gonna be great,\n\n1:12:52.020 --> 1:12:52.860\n and then no one else would,\n\n1:12:52.860 --> 1:12:54.860\n there'd be the machine learning class everyone takes, right?\n\n1:12:54.860 --> 1:12:57.300\n That was never gonna happen, but something like that,\n\n1:12:57.300 --> 1:12:58.140\n you can see happening. But I feel like\n\n1:12:58.140 --> 1:12:58.960\n you didn't address that.\n\n1:12:58.960 --> 1:13:02.220\n Why, why, why is it that, why, why?\n\n1:13:02.220 --> 1:13:04.220\n I don't think that will be the thing that happens.\n\n1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:05.340\n So the college experience,\n\n1:13:05.340 --> 1:13:07.220\n maybe I missed what the college experience was.\n\n1:13:07.220 --> 1:13:10.140\n I thought it was peers, like people hanging around.\n\n1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.660\n A large part of it is peers.\n\n1:13:11.660 --> 1:13:13.600\n Well, it's peers and independence.\n\n1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:15.040\n Yeah, but none of that,\n\n1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:17.320\n you can do classes online for all of that.\n\n1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.780\n No, no, no, no, because we're social people, right?\n\n1:13:20.780 --> 1:13:21.620\n So you wanna be in the same room.\n\n1:13:21.620 --> 1:13:22.440\n So when we take the classes,\n\n1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:25.200\n that also has to be part of an experience.\n\n1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:27.340\n It's in a context, and the context is the university.\n\n1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:29.580\n And by the way, it actually matters\n\n1:13:29.580 --> 1:13:32.060\n that Georgia Tech really is different from Brown.\n\n1:13:33.260 --> 1:13:36.120\n I see, because then students can choose\n\n1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:37.220\n the kind of experience they think\n\n1:13:37.220 --> 1:13:38.300\n is gonna be best for them.\n\n1:13:38.300 --> 1:13:41.060\n Okay, I think we're giving too much agency to the students\n\n1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:42.460\n in making an informed decision.\n\n1:13:42.460 --> 1:13:43.300\n Okay. But the truth,\n\n1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:45.480\n but yes, they will make choices\n\n1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:46.780\n and they will have different experiences.\n\n1:13:46.780 --> 1:13:48.620\n And some of those choices will be made for them.\n\n1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:49.980\n Some of them will be choices they're making\n\n1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:51.620\n because they think it's this, that, or the other.\n\n1:13:51.620 --> 1:13:52.700\n I just don't want to say,\n\n1:13:52.700 --> 1:13:53.540\n I don't want to give the idea.\n\n1:13:53.540 --> 1:13:55.100\n It's not homogenous.\n\n1:13:55.100 --> 1:13:56.940\n Yes, it's certainly not homogenous, right?\n\n1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:59.420\n I mean, Georgia Tech is different from Brown.\n\n1:13:59.420 --> 1:14:03.340\n Brown is different from pick your favorite state school\n\n1:14:03.340 --> 1:14:05.780\n in Iowa, Iowa State, okay?\n\n1:14:05.780 --> 1:14:07.900\n Which I guess is my favorite state school in Iowa.\n\n1:14:07.900 --> 1:14:09.700\n But these are all different.\n\n1:14:09.700 --> 1:14:10.700\n They have different contexts.\n\n1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:12.180\n And a lot of those contexts are,\n\n1:14:12.180 --> 1:14:13.560\n they're about history, yes,\n\n1:14:13.560 --> 1:14:15.980\n but they're also about the location of where you are.\n\n1:14:15.980 --> 1:14:18.240\n They're about the larger group of people who are around you,\n\n1:14:18.240 --> 1:14:20.560\n whether you're in Athens, Georgia,\n\n1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:23.120\n and you're basically the only thing that's there\n\n1:14:23.120 --> 1:14:25.340\n as a university, you're responsible for all the jobs,\n\n1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:27.100\n or whether you're at Georgia State University,\n\n1:14:27.100 --> 1:14:28.980\n which is an urban campus,\n\n1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:31.860\n where you're surrounded by six million people\n\n1:14:31.860 --> 1:14:33.920\n in your campus where it ends and begins in the city,\n\n1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:35.540\n ends and begins, we don't know.\n\n1:14:35.540 --> 1:14:37.300\n It actually matters whether you're a small campus\n\n1:14:37.300 --> 1:14:38.140\n or a large campus.\n\n1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:38.960\n I mean, these things matter.\n\n1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:41.580\n Why is it that if you go to Georgia Tech,\n\n1:14:41.580 --> 1:14:44.860\n you're forever proud of that,\n\n1:14:44.860 --> 1:14:47.380\n and you say that to people at dinners,\n\n1:14:47.380 --> 1:14:49.400\n like bars and whatever,\n\n1:14:49.400 --> 1:14:54.400\n and if you get a degree at an online university somewhere,\n\n1:14:56.660 --> 1:14:58.940\n that's not a thing that comes up at a bar.\n\n1:14:58.940 --> 1:14:59.800\n Well, it's funny you say that.\n\n1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:02.740\n So the students who take our online masters\n\n1:15:03.700 --> 1:15:06.580\n by several measures are more loyal\n\n1:15:06.580 --> 1:15:07.820\n than the students who come on campus,\n\n1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:09.300\n certainly for the master's degree.\n\n1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:10.920\n The reason for that, I think,\n\n1:15:10.920 --> 1:15:11.840\n and you'd have to ask them,\n\n1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:13.920\n but based on my conversations with them,\n\n1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.460\n I feel comfortable saying this,\n\n1:15:15.460 --> 1:15:18.100\n is because this didn't exist before.\n\n1:15:18.100 --> 1:15:19.740\n I mean, we talk about this online masters\n\n1:15:19.740 --> 1:15:22.060\n and that it's reaching 11,000 students,\n\n1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:22.980\n and that's an amazing thing,\n\n1:15:22.980 --> 1:15:25.060\n and we're admitting everyone we believe who can succeed.\n\n1:15:25.060 --> 1:15:26.620\n We got a 60% acceptance rate.\n\n1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:27.820\n It's amazing, right?\n\n1:15:27.820 --> 1:15:29.660\n It's also a $6,600 degree.\n\n1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:32.020\n The entire degree costs $6,600 or $7,000,\n\n1:15:32.020 --> 1:15:33.440\n depending on how long you take.\n\n1:15:33.440 --> 1:15:35.580\n A dollar degree, as opposed to $46,000\n\n1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:37.860\n it would cost you to come on campus.\n\n1:15:37.860 --> 1:15:40.540\n So that feels, and I can do it while I'm working full time,\n\n1:15:40.540 --> 1:15:42.180\n and I've got a family and a mortgage\n\n1:15:42.180 --> 1:15:43.340\n and all these other things.\n\n1:15:43.340 --> 1:15:46.220\n So it's an opportunity to do something you wanted to do,\n\n1:15:46.220 --> 1:15:47.700\n but you didn't think was possible\n\n1:15:47.700 --> 1:15:50.300\n without giving up two years of your life,\n\n1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:51.300\n as well as all the money\n\n1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:53.140\n and everything else in the life that you had built.\n\n1:15:53.140 --> 1:15:56.940\n So I think we created something that's had an impact,\n\n1:15:56.940 --> 1:15:59.640\n but importantly, we gave a set of people opportunities\n\n1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:00.840\n they otherwise didn't feel they had.\n\n1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:02.860\n So I think people feel very loyal about that.\n\n1:16:02.860 --> 1:16:04.180\n And my biggest piece of evidence for that,\n\n1:16:04.180 --> 1:16:05.320\n besides the surveys,\n\n1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.660\n is that we have somewhere north of 80 students,\n\n1:16:08.660 --> 1:16:09.980\n might be 100 at this point,\n\n1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:14.980\n who graduated, but come back in TA for this class,\n\n1:16:15.020 --> 1:16:16.780\n for basically minimum wage,\n\n1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:17.980\n even though they're working full time,\n\n1:16:17.980 --> 1:16:21.940\n because they believe in sort of having that opportunity\n\n1:16:21.940 --> 1:16:23.360\n and they wanna be a part of something.\n\n1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:25.980\n Now, will generation three feel this way?\n\n1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:28.020\n 15 years from now, will people have that same sense?\n\n1:16:28.020 --> 1:16:31.100\n I don't know, but right now they kind of do.\n\n1:16:31.100 --> 1:16:32.900\n And so it's not the online,\n\n1:16:32.900 --> 1:16:36.140\n it's a matter of feeling as if you're a part of something.\n\n1:16:36.140 --> 1:16:39.020\n Right, we're all very tribal, right?\n\n1:16:39.020 --> 1:16:42.100\n And I think there's something very tribal\n\n1:16:42.100 --> 1:16:44.280\n about being a part of something like that.\n\n1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:45.880\n Being on campus makes that easier,\n\n1:16:45.880 --> 1:16:48.220\n going through a shared experience makes that easier.\n\n1:16:48.220 --> 1:16:49.720\n It's harder to have that shared experience\n\n1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:52.020\n if you're alone looking at a computer screen.\n\n1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:53.340\n We can create ways to make that true.\n\n1:16:53.340 --> 1:16:54.340\n But is it possible?\n\n1:16:54.340 --> 1:16:55.220\n It is possible.\n\n1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:58.360\n The question is, it still is the intuition to me,\n\n1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:01.420\n and it was at the beginning when I saw something\n\n1:17:01.420 --> 1:17:04.580\n like the online master's program,\n\n1:17:04.580 --> 1:17:07.980\n is that this is gonna replace universities.\n\n1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:09.200\n No, it won't replace universities.\n\n1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:11.080\n But like why?\n\n1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:11.920\n Because it's living\n\n1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:13.920\n in a different part of the ecosystem, right?\n\n1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:15.660\n The people who are taking it are already adults,\n\n1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:18.720\n they've gone through their undergrad experience.\n\n1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:21.900\n I think their goals have shifted from when they were 17.\n\n1:17:21.900 --> 1:17:23.380\n They have other things that are going on.\n\n1:17:23.380 --> 1:17:25.540\n But it does do something really important,\n\n1:17:25.540 --> 1:17:28.380\n something very social and very important, right?\n\n1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:30.220\n You know this whole thing about,\n\n1:17:30.220 --> 1:17:32.060\n don't build the sidewalks, just leave the grass\n\n1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:33.640\n and the students or the people will walk\n\n1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:35.340\n and you put the sidewalks where they create paths,\n\n1:17:35.340 --> 1:17:36.180\n this kind of thing.\n\n1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:37.580\n That's interesting, yeah.\n\n1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.060\n Their architects apparently believe\n\n1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:40.740\n that's the right way to do things.\n\n1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:45.260\n The metaphor here is that we created this environment,\n\n1:17:45.260 --> 1:17:48.660\n we didn't quite know how to think about the social aspect,\n\n1:17:48.660 --> 1:17:51.100\n but we didn't have time to solve all,\n\n1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:53.100\n do all the social engineering, right?\n\n1:17:53.100 --> 1:17:54.220\n The students did it themselves,\n\n1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:58.400\n they created these groups, like on Google Plus,\n\n1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:00.160\n there were like 30 something groups created\n\n1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:04.220\n in the first year because somebody had used Google Plus.\n\n1:18:04.220 --> 1:18:05.680\n And they created these groups\n\n1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:07.380\n and they divided up in ways that made sense.\n\n1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:08.620\n We live in the same state or we're working\n\n1:18:08.620 --> 1:18:10.060\n on the same things or we have the same background\n\n1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.060\n or whatever and they created these social things.\n\n1:18:12.060 --> 1:18:14.100\n We sent them T shirts and they wear,\n\n1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:16.540\n we have all these great pictures of students\n\n1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:18.340\n putting on their T shirts as they travel around the world.\n\n1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:20.560\n I climbed this mountain top, I'm putting this T shirt on,\n\n1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:22.060\n I'm a part of this, they were a part of them.\n\n1:18:22.060 --> 1:18:24.660\n They created the social environment\n\n1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:26.740\n on top of the social network and the social media\n\n1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:29.380\n that existed to create this sense of belonging\n\n1:18:29.380 --> 1:18:30.500\n and being a part of something.\n\n1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:32.700\n They found a way to do it, right?\n\n1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:36.180\n And I think they had other,\n\n1:18:36.180 --> 1:18:38.100\n it scratched an itch that they had,\n\n1:18:38.100 --> 1:18:40.140\n but they had scratched some of that itch\n\n1:18:40.140 --> 1:18:41.500\n that might've required they'd be physically\n\n1:18:41.500 --> 1:18:44.420\n in the same place long before, right?\n\n1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:47.220\n So I think, yes, it's possible\n\n1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:49.640\n and it's more than possible, it's necessary.\n\n1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:54.220\n But I don't think it's going to replace the university\n\n1:18:54.220 --> 1:18:55.180\n as we know it.\n\n1:18:55.180 --> 1:18:57.620\n The university as we know it will change.\n\n1:18:57.620 --> 1:18:59.180\n But there's just a lot of power\n\n1:18:59.180 --> 1:19:00.440\n in the kind of rite of passage\n\n1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:01.500\n kind of going off to yourself.\n\n1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:03.140\n Now, maybe there'll be some other rite of passage\n\n1:19:03.140 --> 1:19:03.980\n that'll happen.\n\n1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:06.100\n That'll drive us somewhere else, it's possible.\n\n1:19:06.100 --> 1:19:11.100\n So the university is such a fascinating mess of things.\n\n1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:14.660\n So just even the faculty position is a fascinating mess.\n\n1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:15.900\n Like it doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:19:15.900 --> 1:19:18.260\n It's stabilized itself,\n\n1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:22.080\n but like why are the world class researchers\n\n1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:26.660\n spending a huge amount of time or their time teaching\n\n1:19:26.660 --> 1:19:27.980\n and service?\n\n1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:29.540\n Like you're doing like three jobs.\n\n1:19:29.540 --> 1:19:34.540\n And I mean, it turns out it's maybe an accident of history\n\n1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:36.340\n or human evolution, I don't know.\n\n1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:38.460\n It seems like the people who are really good at teaching\n\n1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:40.420\n are often really good at research.\n\n1:19:40.420 --> 1:19:42.780\n There seems to be a parallel there,\n\n1:19:42.780 --> 1:19:44.480\n but like it doesn't make any sense\n\n1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:45.460\n that you should be doing that.\n\n1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:48.740\n At the same time, it also doesn't seem to make sense\n\n1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:52.060\n that your place where you party\n\n1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:56.340\n is the same place where you go to learn calculus\n\n1:19:56.340 --> 1:19:57.540\n or whatever.\n\n1:19:57.540 --> 1:19:59.300\n But it's a safe space.\n\n1:19:59.300 --> 1:20:00.540\n Safe space for everything.\n\n1:20:00.540 --> 1:20:02.380\n Yeah, relatively speaking, it's a safe space.\n\n1:20:02.380 --> 1:20:05.300\n Now, by the way, I feel the need very strongly\n\n1:20:05.300 --> 1:20:07.180\n to point out that we are living\n\n1:20:07.180 --> 1:20:09.500\n in a very particular weird bubble, right?\n\n1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:10.860\n Most people don't go to college.\n\n1:20:10.860 --> 1:20:12.880\n And by the way, the ones who do go to college,\n\n1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:14.340\n they're not 18 years old, right?\n\n1:20:14.340 --> 1:20:15.500\n They're like 25 or something.\n\n1:20:15.500 --> 1:20:17.120\n I forget the numbers.\n\n1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.940\n The places where we've been, where we are,\n\n1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:22.380\n they look like whatever we think\n\n1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:25.520\n the traditional movie version of universities are.\n\n1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:27.460\n But for most people, it's not that way at all.\n\n1:20:27.460 --> 1:20:28.940\n By the way, most people who drop out of college,\n\n1:20:28.940 --> 1:20:31.420\n it's entirely for financial reasons, right?\n\n1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:35.340\n So we were talking about a particular experience.\n\n1:20:36.700 --> 1:20:38.700\n And so for that set of people,\n\n1:20:38.700 --> 1:20:42.940\n which is very small, but larger than it was a decade\n\n1:20:42.940 --> 1:20:45.020\n or two or three or four, certainly, ago,\n\n1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:47.180\n I don't think that will change.\n\n1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:50.460\n My concern, which I think is kind of implicit\n\n1:20:50.460 --> 1:20:51.540\n in some of these questions,\n\n1:20:51.540 --> 1:20:54.220\n is that somehow we will divide the world up further\n\n1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:57.060\n into the people who get to have this experience\n\n1:20:57.060 --> 1:20:57.900\n and get to have the network\n\n1:20:57.900 --> 1:20:59.220\n and they sort of benefit from it,\n\n1:20:59.220 --> 1:21:01.900\n and everyone else, while increasingly requiring\n\n1:21:01.900 --> 1:21:03.180\n that they have more and more credentials\n\n1:21:03.180 --> 1:21:05.920\n in order to get a job as a barista, right?\n\n1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:07.020\n You gotta have a master's degree\n\n1:21:07.020 --> 1:21:08.780\n in order to work at Starbucks.\n\n1:21:08.780 --> 1:21:10.740\n I mean, we're gonna force people to do these things,\n\n1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:12.460\n but they're not gonna get to have that experience,\n\n1:21:12.460 --> 1:21:13.860\n and there'll be a small group of people who do\n\n1:21:13.860 --> 1:21:15.740\n who will continue to, you know, positive feedback,\n\n1:21:15.740 --> 1:21:16.940\n look, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:19.860\n I worry a lot about that, which is why, for me,\n\n1:21:21.060 --> 1:21:21.980\n and by the way, here's an answer\n\n1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:22.940\n to your question about faculty,\n\n1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:24.400\n which is why, to me, that you have to focus\n\n1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:26.060\n on access and the mission.\n\n1:21:26.060 --> 1:21:28.180\n I think the reason, whether it's good, bad, or strange,\n\n1:21:28.180 --> 1:21:29.740\n I mean, I agree, it's strange,\n\n1:21:29.740 --> 1:21:32.180\n but I think it's useful to have the faculty member,\n\n1:21:32.180 --> 1:21:33.860\n particularly at large R1 universities\n\n1:21:33.860 --> 1:21:36.580\n where we've all had experiences,\n\n1:21:36.580 --> 1:21:41.060\n that you tie what they get to do\n\n1:21:41.060 --> 1:21:43.900\n and with the fundamental mission of the university\n\n1:21:43.900 --> 1:21:45.060\n and let the mission drive.\n\n1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:47.080\n What I hear when I talk to faculty is,\n\n1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:48.340\n they love their PhD students\n\n1:21:48.340 --> 1:21:51.100\n because they're reproducing, basically, right?\n\n1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:53.700\n And it lets them do their research and multiply.\n\n1:21:53.700 --> 1:21:57.300\n But they understand that the mission is the undergrads,\n\n1:21:57.300 --> 1:22:00.380\n and so they will do it without complaint, mostly,\n\n1:22:00.380 --> 1:22:02.420\n because it's a part of the mission and why they're here,\n\n1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:04.140\n and they have experiences with it themselves,\n\n1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:06.340\n and it was important to get them\n\n1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:07.420\n where they were going.\n\n1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:09.020\n The people who tend to get squeezed in that, by the way,\n\n1:22:09.020 --> 1:22:10.380\n are the master's students, right,\n\n1:22:10.380 --> 1:22:12.220\n who are neither the PhDs who are like us\n\n1:22:12.220 --> 1:22:14.820\n nor the undergrads we have already bought into the idea\n\n1:22:14.820 --> 1:22:16.460\n that we have to teach, though.\n\n1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:18.180\n That's increasingly changing.\n\n1:22:18.180 --> 1:22:21.020\n Anyway, I think tying that mission in really matters,\n\n1:22:21.020 --> 1:22:23.260\n and it gives you a way to unify people\n\n1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:26.100\n around making it an actual higher calling.\n\n1:22:26.100 --> 1:22:28.100\n Education feels like more of a higher calling to me\n\n1:22:28.100 --> 1:22:29.720\n than even research,\n\n1:22:30.780 --> 1:22:33.860\n because education, you cannot treat it as a hobby\n\n1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:34.900\n if you're going to do it well.\n\n1:22:34.900 --> 1:22:38.380\n But that's the pushback on this whole system\n\n1:22:38.380 --> 1:22:43.380\n is that education should be a full time job, right?\n\n1:22:44.420 --> 1:22:49.020\n And it's almost like research is a distraction from that.\n\n1:22:49.020 --> 1:22:51.300\n Yes, although I think most of our colleagues,\n\n1:22:51.300 --> 1:22:53.340\n many of our colleagues would say that research is the job\n\n1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:55.100\n and education is the distraction.\n\n1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:56.620\n Right, but that's the beautiful dance.\n\n1:22:56.620 --> 1:23:01.360\n It seems to be that tension in itself seems to work,\n\n1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:05.820\n seems to bring out the best in the faculty.\n\n1:23:07.220 --> 1:23:08.300\n But I will point out two things.\n\n1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:09.120\n One thing I'm going to point out,\n\n1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:10.740\n and the other thing I want Michael to point out,\n\n1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:11.920\n because I think Michael is much closer\n\n1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:16.920\n to sort of the ideal professor in some sense than I am.\n\n1:23:17.260 --> 1:23:18.100\n Well, he is a dean.\n\n1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:19.620\n You're the platonic sense of a professor.\n\n1:23:19.620 --> 1:23:20.860\n I don't know what he meant by that,\n\n1:23:20.860 --> 1:23:23.340\n but he is a dean, so he has a different experience.\n\n1:23:23.340 --> 1:23:26.200\n I'm giving him time to think of the profound thing\n\n1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:27.040\n he's going to say.\n\n1:23:27.040 --> 1:23:27.860\n That was good.\n\n1:23:27.860 --> 1:23:28.700\n But let me point this out,\n\n1:23:28.700 --> 1:23:31.500\n which is that we have lecturers\n\n1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:33.900\n in the College of Computing where I am.\n\n1:23:33.900 --> 1:23:35.640\n There's 10 or 12 of them, depending on how you count,\n\n1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:39.140\n as opposed to the 90 or so tenure track faculty.\n\n1:23:39.140 --> 1:23:41.140\n Those 10 lecturers who only teach,\n\n1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:42.860\n well, they don't only teach, they also do service.\n\n1:23:42.860 --> 1:23:46.560\n Some of them do research as well, but primarily they teach.\n\n1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:49.620\n They teach 50%, over 50% of our credit hours,\n\n1:23:49.620 --> 1:23:51.260\n and we teach everybody, right?\n\n1:23:51.260 --> 1:23:54.100\n So they're doing not just,\n\n1:23:54.100 --> 1:23:56.300\n they're doing more than eight times the work\n\n1:23:56.300 --> 1:23:59.180\n of the tenure track faculty,\n\n1:23:59.180 --> 1:24:01.620\n just more closer to nine or 10.\n\n1:24:01.620 --> 1:24:03.020\n And that's including our grad courses, right?\n\n1:24:03.020 --> 1:24:05.100\n So they're doing this, they're teaching more,\n\n1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:07.100\n they're touching more than anyone,\n\n1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:08.860\n and they're beloved for it.\n\n1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:11.660\n I mean, so we recently had a survey.\n\n1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:12.900\n Everyone does these alumni surveys.\n\n1:24:12.900 --> 1:24:14.260\n You hire someone from the outside to do whatever,\n\n1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:15.900\n and I was really struck by something.\n\n1:24:15.900 --> 1:24:17.380\n You saw all these really cool numbers.\n\n1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:18.260\n I'm not going to talk about it\n\n1:24:18.260 --> 1:24:19.900\n because it's all internal, confidential stuff.\n\n1:24:19.900 --> 1:24:21.140\n But one thing I will talk about\n\n1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:23.100\n is there was a single question we asked our alum,\n\n1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:24.420\n and these are people who graduated,\n\n1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:25.860\n born in the 30s and 40s,\n\n1:24:25.860 --> 1:24:28.520\n all the way up to people who graduated last week, right?\n\n1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:30.540\n Well, last semester.\n\n1:24:30.540 --> 1:24:31.380\n Okay, good.\n\n1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:33.320\n Time flies.\n\n1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:34.680\n Yeah, time flies.\n\n1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:36.420\n And it was the question,\n\n1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:40.900\n name a single person who had a strong positive impact on you,\n\n1:24:40.900 --> 1:24:42.100\n something like that.\n\n1:24:42.100 --> 1:24:44.340\n I think it was special impact?\n\n1:24:44.340 --> 1:24:45.580\n Yeah, special impact on you.\n\n1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:47.220\n And then, so they got all the answers from people,\n\n1:24:47.220 --> 1:24:49.040\n and they created a word cloud.\n\n1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:50.540\n It was clearly a word cloud created by people\n\n1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:52.220\n who don't do word clouds for a living\n\n1:24:52.220 --> 1:24:54.780\n because they had one person whose name appeared\n\n1:24:54.780 --> 1:24:56.220\n like nine different times,\n\n1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:59.340\n like Philip, Phil, Dr. Phil, you know, but whatever.\n\n1:24:59.340 --> 1:25:00.180\n But they got all this.\n\n1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:02.340\n And I looked at it, and I noticed something really cool.\n\n1:25:02.340 --> 1:25:06.700\n The five people from the College of Computing,\n\n1:25:06.700 --> 1:25:09.220\n I recognized, were in that cloud.\n\n1:25:09.220 --> 1:25:13.780\n And four of them were lecturers,\n\n1:25:13.780 --> 1:25:15.220\n the people who teach.\n\n1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:17.320\n Two of them, relatively modern,\n\n1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:19.840\n both were chairs of our division of computing instruction.\n\n1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:22.180\n One just, one retired, one is going to retire soon.\n\n1:25:22.180 --> 1:25:23.620\n And the other two were lecturers,\n\n1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.460\n I remembered, from the 1980s.\n\n1:25:26.460 --> 1:25:28.020\n Two of those four actually have.\n\n1:25:28.020 --> 1:25:29.700\n By the way, the fifth person was Charles.\n\n1:25:29.700 --> 1:25:30.540\n That's not important.\n\n1:25:30.540 --> 1:25:32.920\n The thing is, I don't tell people that.\n\n1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:34.540\n But the two of those people\n\n1:25:34.540 --> 1:25:36.000\n our teaching awards are named after.\n\n1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:36.840\n Thank you, Michael.\n\n1:25:36.840 --> 1:25:39.680\n Two of those our teaching awards are named after, right?\n\n1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:41.720\n So when you ask students, alumni,\n\n1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:44.220\n people who are now 60, 70 years old even,\n\n1:25:44.220 --> 1:25:45.280\n you know, who touched them?\n\n1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:46.660\n They say the Dean of Students.\n\n1:25:46.660 --> 1:25:48.260\n They say the big teachers who taught\n\n1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:50.220\n the big introductory classes that got me into it.\n\n1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:52.300\n There's a guy named Richard Park who's on there,\n\n1:25:52.300 --> 1:25:55.380\n who's, you know, who's known as a great teacher.\n\n1:25:55.380 --> 1:25:57.060\n The Phil Adler guy who,\n\n1:25:58.500 --> 1:26:00.060\n I probably just said his last name wrong,\n\n1:26:00.060 --> 1:26:01.100\n but I know the first name's Phil\n\n1:26:01.100 --> 1:26:03.140\n because he kept showing up over and over again.\n\n1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:03.960\n Famous.\n\n1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:04.800\n Adler is what it said.\n\n1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:05.640\n Okay, good.\n\n1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:06.820\n But different people spelled it differently.\n\n1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:07.940\n So he appeared multiple times.\n\n1:26:07.940 --> 1:26:08.780\n Right.\n\n1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:10.500\n So he was a, clearly,\n\n1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:13.040\n he was a professor in the business school.\n\n1:26:14.180 --> 1:26:15.860\n But when you read about him,\n\n1:26:15.860 --> 1:26:17.420\n I went to read about him because I was curious who he was.\n\n1:26:17.420 --> 1:26:18.660\n You know, it's all about his teaching\n\n1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:20.060\n and the students that he touched, right?\n\n1:26:20.060 --> 1:26:22.320\n So whatever it is that we're doing\n\n1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:23.420\n and we think we're doing that's important\n\n1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:25.340\n or why we think the universities function,\n\n1:26:25.340 --> 1:26:26.740\n the people who go through it,\n\n1:26:27.740 --> 1:26:29.500\n they remember the people who were kind to them,\n\n1:26:29.500 --> 1:26:31.380\n the people who taught them something,\n\n1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:32.460\n and they do remember it.\n\n1:26:32.460 --> 1:26:33.500\n They remember it later.\n\n1:26:33.500 --> 1:26:35.820\n I think that's important.\n\n1:26:35.820 --> 1:26:37.200\n That's why the mission matters.\n\n1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:38.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:26:38.040 --> 1:26:41.940\n Not to completely lose track of the fundamental problem\n\n1:26:41.940 --> 1:26:46.940\n of how do we replace the party aspect of universities\n\n1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:51.420\n before we go to the what makes the platonic professor.\n\n1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:56.420\n Do you think, like, what in your sense is the role of MOOCs\n\n1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:00.360\n in this whole picture during COVID?\n\n1:27:00.360 --> 1:27:04.160\n Like, should we desperately be clamoring\n\n1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:05.880\n to get back on campus?\n\n1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:08.880\n Or is this a stable place to be for a little while?\n\n1:27:08.880 --> 1:27:09.720\n I don't know.\n\n1:27:09.720 --> 1:27:12.560\n I know that the online teaching experience\n\n1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:15.920\n and learning experience has been really rough.\n\n1:27:15.920 --> 1:27:18.240\n I think that people find it to be a struggle\n\n1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:21.960\n in a way that's not a happy, positive struggle,\n\n1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:23.080\n that when you got through it,\n\n1:27:23.080 --> 1:27:24.760\n you just feel like glad that it's over\n\n1:27:24.760 --> 1:27:27.780\n as opposed to I've achieved something.\n\n1:27:27.780 --> 1:27:29.640\n So, you know, I worry about that.\n\n1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:33.800\n But, you know, I worry about just even before this happened,\n\n1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:35.640\n I worry about lecture teaching,\n\n1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:38.700\n how well is that actually really working\n\n1:27:38.700 --> 1:27:40.640\n as far as a way to do education,\n\n1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:43.560\n as a way to inspire people.\n\n1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:47.040\n I mean, all the data that I'm aware of seems to indicate,\n\n1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:49.640\n and this kind of fits, I think, with Charles's story,\n\n1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:54.480\n is that people respond to connection, right?\n\n1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:57.400\n They actually feel, if they feel connected\n\n1:27:57.400 --> 1:27:59.120\n to the person teaching the class,\n\n1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:00.680\n they're more likely to go along with it.\n\n1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:02.960\n They're more able to retain information.\n\n1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:05.040\n They're more motivated to be involved\n\n1:28:05.040 --> 1:28:06.840\n in the class in some way.\n\n1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:09.840\n And that really matters.\n\n1:28:09.840 --> 1:28:10.680\n People...\n\n1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.160\n You mean to the human themselves.\n\n1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.600\n Okay, can't you do that actually\n\n1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:18.360\n perhaps more effectively online?\n\n1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.220\n Like you mentioned, science communication.\n\n1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:24.920\n So I literally, I think, learned linear algebra\n\n1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:28.280\n from Gilbert Strang by watching MIT OpenCourseWare\n\n1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:29.320\n when I was in track.\n\n1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:31.040\n Like, and he was a personality,\n\n1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:33.160\n he was a bit like a tiny...\n\n1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.160\n In this tiny little world of math,\n\n1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:36.560\n he's a bit of a rockstar, right?\n\n1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:40.720\n So you kind of look up to that person.\n\n1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:44.880\n Can't that replace the in person education?\n\n1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:45.720\n It can help.\n\n1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:47.520\n I will point out something, I can't share the numbers,\n\n1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:50.000\n but we have surveyed our students,\n\n1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.440\n and even though they have feelings\n\n1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:54.400\n about what I would interpret as connection,\n\n1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:58.440\n I like that word, in the different modes of classrooms,\n\n1:28:58.440 --> 1:29:00.860\n there's no difference between how well\n\n1:29:00.860 --> 1:29:02.560\n they think they're learning.\n\n1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:05.680\n For them, the thing that makes them unhappy\n\n1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:06.960\n is the situation they're in.\n\n1:29:06.960 --> 1:29:08.700\n And I think the lack of connection,\n\n1:29:08.700 --> 1:29:10.560\n it's not whether they're learning anything.\n\n1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:13.360\n They seem to think they're learning something anyway, right?\n\n1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:14.360\n In fact, they seem to think\n\n1:29:14.360 --> 1:29:15.960\n they're learning it equally well,\n\n1:29:16.920 --> 1:29:20.640\n presumably because the faculty are putting in,\n\n1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.960\n or the instructors, more generally speaking,\n\n1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:25.840\n are putting in the energy and effort\n\n1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:28.920\n to try to make certain that what they've curated\n\n1:29:28.920 --> 1:29:30.640\n can be expressed to them in a useful way.\n\n1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:31.800\n But the connection is missing.\n\n1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:34.160\n And so there's huge differences in what they prefer.\n\n1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:35.000\n And as far as I can tell,\n\n1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.360\n what they prefer is more connection, not less.\n\n1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:39.440\n That connection just doesn't have to be physically\n\n1:29:39.440 --> 1:29:40.280\n in a classroom.\n\n1:29:40.280 --> 1:29:43.520\n I mean, look, I used to teach 348 students\n\n1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:44.840\n in my machine learning class on campus.\n\n1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:45.680\n Do you know why?\n\n1:29:45.680 --> 1:29:47.440\n That was the biggest classroom on campus.\n\n1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:50.840\n They're sitting in theater seats.\n\n1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:54.400\n I'm literally on a stage looking down on them\n\n1:29:54.400 --> 1:29:56.320\n and talking to them, right?\n\n1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:59.640\n There's no, I mean, we're not sitting down,\n\n1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:01.380\n having a one on one conversation,\n\n1:30:01.380 --> 1:30:02.760\n reading each other's body language,\n\n1:30:02.760 --> 1:30:04.080\n trying to communicate and going,\n\n1:30:04.080 --> 1:30:05.400\n we're not doing any of that.\n\n1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:07.520\n So if you're past the third row,\n\n1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:08.800\n it might as well be online anyway\n\n1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:10.280\n is the kind of thing that people have said.\n\n1:30:10.280 --> 1:30:12.920\n Daphne has actually said some version of this\n\n1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:15.600\n that online starts on the third row or something like that.\n\n1:30:15.600 --> 1:30:18.560\n And I think that's not, yeah, I like it.\n\n1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:20.320\n I think it captures something important.\n\n1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:22.120\n But people still came, by the way.\n\n1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:23.880\n Even the people who had access to our material\n\n1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:25.240\n would still come to class.\n\n1:30:25.240 --> 1:30:26.420\n I mean, there's a certain element\n\n1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:28.560\n about looking to the person next to you.\n\n1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:32.320\n It's just like their presence there, their boredom.\n\n1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:34.960\n And like when the parts are boring\n\n1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:37.960\n and their excitement when the parts are exciting,\n\n1:30:37.960 --> 1:30:39.560\n like in sharing in that,\n\n1:30:39.560 --> 1:30:43.680\n like unspoken kind of, yeah, communication.\n\n1:30:43.680 --> 1:30:45.840\n In part, the connection is with the other people\n\n1:30:45.840 --> 1:30:46.680\n in the room.\n\n1:30:46.680 --> 1:30:51.680\n Yeah, watching the circus on TV alone is not really.\n\n1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:53.440\n Ever been to a movie theater\n\n1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:55.280\n and been the only one there at a comedy?\n\n1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:58.200\n It's not as funny as when you're in a room\n\n1:30:58.200 --> 1:31:00.080\n full of people all laughing.\n\n1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.480\n Well, you need, maybe you need just another person.\n\n1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:04.640\n It's like, as opposed to many.\n\n1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.120\n Maybe there's some kind of.\n\n1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:07.800\n Well, there's different kinds of connection, right?\n\n1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.600\n And there's different kinds of comedy.\n\n1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:12.560\n Well, in the sense that.\n\n1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:13.680\n As we're learning today.\n\n1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:16.200\n I wasn't sure if that was gonna land.\n\n1:31:16.200 --> 1:31:21.200\n But just the idea that different jokes,\n\n1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:23.120\n I've now done a little bit of standup.\n\n1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:26.560\n And so different jokes work in different size crowds too.\n\n1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:27.400\n No, it's true.\n\n1:31:27.400 --> 1:31:30.320\n Where sometimes if it's a big enough crowd,\n\n1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:33.600\n then even a really subtle joke can take root someplace\n\n1:31:33.600 --> 1:31:34.920\n and then that cues other people.\n\n1:31:34.920 --> 1:31:36.320\n And it kind of,\n\n1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:38.640\n there's a whole statistics of.\n\n1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:40.160\n I did this terrible thing to my brother.\n\n1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:41.360\n So when I was really young,\n\n1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:44.720\n I decided that my brother was only laughing\n\n1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:46.480\n as it comes when I laughed.\n\n1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:48.160\n Like he was taking cues from me.\n\n1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:50.100\n So I like purposely didn't laugh\n\n1:31:50.100 --> 1:31:50.940\n just to see if I was right.\n\n1:31:50.940 --> 1:31:52.320\n And did you laugh at non funny things?\n\n1:31:52.320 --> 1:31:53.160\n Yes.\n\n1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:54.000\n You really wanna do both sides.\n\n1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:54.960\n I did both sides.\n\n1:31:54.960 --> 1:31:58.400\n And at the end of it, I told him what I did.\n\n1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:00.000\n He was very upset about this.\n\n1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:01.920\n And from that day on.\n\n1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:03.000\n He lost his sense of humor.\n\n1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:03.840\n No, no, no, no.\n\n1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:04.660\n Well, yes.\n\n1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:07.680\n But from that day on, he laughed on his own.\n\n1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:08.760\n He stopped taking cues from me.\n\n1:32:08.760 --> 1:32:09.600\n I see.\n\n1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:11.720\n So I wanna say that it was a good thing that I did.\n\n1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:12.560\n Yes, yes.\n\n1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:14.040\n You saved that man's life.\n\n1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:15.160\n Yes, but it was mostly mean.\n\n1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:15.980\n But it's true though.\n\n1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:16.820\n It's true, right?\n\n1:32:16.820 --> 1:32:19.320\n That people, I think you're right.\n\n1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:20.860\n But okay, so where does that get us?\n\n1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:23.040\n That gets us the idea that,\n\n1:32:23.040 --> 1:32:26.220\n I mean, certainly movie theaters are a thing, right?\n\n1:32:26.220 --> 1:32:28.260\n Where people like to be watching together,\n\n1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:30.800\n even though the people on the screen\n\n1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:33.040\n aren't really co present with the people in the audience.\n\n1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:35.000\n The audience is co present with themselves.\n\n1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.200\n By the way, and that point,\n\n1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:38.600\n it's an open question that's being raised by this,\n\n1:32:38.600 --> 1:32:40.960\n whether movies will no longer be a thing\n\n1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:43.720\n because Netflix's audience is growing.\n\n1:32:43.720 --> 1:32:47.160\n So that's, it's a very parallel question for education.\n\n1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:50.080\n Will movie theaters still be a thing in 2021?\n\n1:32:50.080 --> 1:32:52.000\n No, but I think the argument is\n\n1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:54.680\n that there is a feeling of being in the crowd\n\n1:32:54.680 --> 1:32:57.480\n that isn't replicated by being at home watching it\n\n1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.280\n and that there's value in that.\n\n1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:00.120\n And then I think just.\n\n1:33:00.120 --> 1:33:02.040\n But, but.\n\n1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:03.280\n It scales better online.\n\n1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:06.840\n But I feel like we're having a conversation\n\n1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:09.320\n about whether concerts will still exist\n\n1:33:09.320 --> 1:33:13.040\n after the invention of the record or the CD\n\n1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:13.960\n or wherever it is, right?\n\n1:33:13.960 --> 1:33:14.920\n They won't.\n\n1:33:14.920 --> 1:33:16.880\n You're right, concerts are dead.\n\n1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:19.580\n Well, okay, I think the joke is only funny\n\n1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:21.520\n if you say it before now.\n\n1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:23.480\n Right, yeah, that's true.\n\n1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:24.440\n Like three years ago.\n\n1:33:24.440 --> 1:33:25.920\n It's like, well, no, obviously concerts are still a big thing.\n\n1:33:25.920 --> 1:33:27.920\n I'll wait to publish this until we have a vaccine.\n\n1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:30.360\n No, you know, we'll fix it in post.\n\n1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:33.320\n But I think the important thing is.\n\n1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:34.400\n Fix the virus post.\n\n1:33:34.400 --> 1:33:36.060\n Concerts changed, right?\n\n1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:37.800\n Concerts changed.\n\n1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:39.560\n First of all, movie theaters weren't this way, right?\n\n1:33:39.560 --> 1:33:41.920\n In like the 60s and 70s, they weren't like this.\n\n1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:44.000\n Like blockbusters were basically what?\n\n1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:47.000\n Well, Jaws and Star Wars created blockbusters, right?\n\n1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:47.840\n Before then, there weren't.\n\n1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:49.740\n Like the whole shared summer experience\n\n1:33:49.740 --> 1:33:52.320\n didn't exist in our lifetimes, right?\n\n1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:53.760\n Certainly you were well into adulthood\n\n1:33:53.760 --> 1:33:54.940\n by the time this was true, right?\n\n1:33:54.940 --> 1:33:56.520\n So it's just a very different.\n\n1:33:56.520 --> 1:33:57.360\n It's very different.\n\n1:33:57.360 --> 1:33:59.480\n So what we've been experiencing in the last 10 years\n\n1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.760\n is not like the majority of human history,\n\n1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:03.480\n but more importantly, concerts, right?\n\n1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:04.680\n Concerts mean something different.\n\n1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:07.640\n Most people don't go to concerts anymore.\n\n1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:09.640\n Like there's an age where you care about it.\n\n1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:10.480\n You sort of stop doing it,\n\n1:34:10.480 --> 1:34:12.240\n but you keep listening to music or whatever\n\n1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:13.800\n and da, da, da, da, da, da, da.\n\n1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:18.800\n So I think that's a painful way of saying that\n\n1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:22.520\n it will change.\n\n1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:23.840\n It was not the same thing as it going away.\n\n1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:27.000\n Replace is too strong of a word, but it will change.\n\n1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:27.840\n It has to.\n\n1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:29.760\n Actually, like to push back, I wonder,\n\n1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:31.880\n because I think you're probably just throwing\n\n1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:33.160\n that your intuition now.\n\n1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:34.200\n Oh, I wasn't.\n\n1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:37.240\n And it's possible that concerts,\n\n1:34:37.240 --> 1:34:39.620\n more people go to concerts now,\n\n1:34:39.620 --> 1:34:42.720\n but obviously much more people listen to,\n\n1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:46.920\n well, that's dumb, than before there was records.\n\n1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:51.660\n It's possible to argue that if you look at the data,\n\n1:34:51.660 --> 1:34:55.960\n that it just expanded the pie of what music listening means.\n\n1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:59.400\n So it's possible that universities grow in the parallel\n\n1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:00.680\n or the theaters grow,\n\n1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:02.600\n but also more people get to watch movies,\n\n1:35:02.600 --> 1:35:05.640\n more people get to be educated.\n\n1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:07.040\n Yeah, I hope that is true.\n\n1:35:07.040 --> 1:35:09.680\n Yeah, and to the extent that we can grow the pie\n\n1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:11.960\n and have education be not just something you do\n\n1:35:11.960 --> 1:35:16.400\n for four years when you're done with your other education,\n\n1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:19.080\n but it be a more lifelong thing,\n\n1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:20.600\n that would have tremendous benefits,\n\n1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:24.480\n especially as the economy and the world change rapidly.\n\n1:35:24.480 --> 1:35:28.880\n People need opportunities to stay abreast of these changes.\n\n1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.680\n And so, I don't know,\n\n1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:33.480\n that's all part of the ecosystem.\n\n1:35:33.480 --> 1:35:34.320\n It's all to the good.\n\n1:35:34.320 --> 1:35:36.880\n I mean, I'm not gonna have an argument\n\n1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:38.920\n about whether we lost fidelity\n\n1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:40.740\n when we went from Laserdisc to DVDs\n\n1:35:40.740 --> 1:35:43.000\n or record players to CDs.\n\n1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.580\n I mean, I'm willing to grant that that is true,\n\n1:35:45.580 --> 1:35:50.580\n but convenience matters and the ability to do something\n\n1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:51.720\n that you couldn't do otherwise\n\n1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:53.760\n because that convenience matters.\n\n1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:56.120\n And you can tell me I'm only getting 90% of the experience,\n\n1:35:56.120 --> 1:35:57.720\n but I'm getting the experience.\n\n1:35:57.720 --> 1:36:00.080\n I wasn't getting it before or it wasn't lasting as long\n\n1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:00.920\n or it wasn't as easy.\n\n1:36:00.920 --> 1:36:03.600\n I mean, this just seems straightforward to me.\n\n1:36:03.600 --> 1:36:05.500\n It's gonna, it's going to change.\n\n1:36:05.500 --> 1:36:08.240\n It is for the good that more people get access\n\n1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.480\n and it is our job to do two separate things.\n\n1:36:10.480 --> 1:36:13.440\n One, to educate them and make access available.\n\n1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:14.700\n That's our mission.\n\n1:36:14.700 --> 1:36:17.040\n But also for very simple selfish reasons,\n\n1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:18.280\n we need to figure out how to do it better\n\n1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:20.100\n so that we individually stay in business.\n\n1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:21.840\n We can do both of those things at the same time.\n\n1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:24.360\n They are not in, they may be intention,\n\n1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:26.760\n but they are not mutually exclusive.\n\n1:36:28.020 --> 1:36:32.120\n So you've educated some scary number of people.\n\n1:36:34.960 --> 1:36:37.320\n So you've seen a lot of people succeed,\n\n1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:39.520\n find their path through life.\n\n1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:44.200\n Is there a device that you can give to a young person today\n\n1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:48.960\n about computer science education,\n\n1:36:48.960 --> 1:36:53.320\n about education in general, about life,\n\n1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:58.320\n about whatever the journey that one takes in there,\n\n1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:02.600\n maybe in their teens, in their early 20s,\n\n1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:05.080\n sort of in those underground years\n\n1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.120\n as you try to go through the essential process of partying\n\n1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:10.740\n and not going to classes\n\n1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:12.920\n and yet somehow trying to get a degree?\n\n1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:16.420\n If you get to the point where you're far enough up\n\n1:37:16.420 --> 1:37:20.240\n in the hierarchy of needs that you can actually\n\n1:37:20.240 --> 1:37:21.880\n make decisions like this,\n\n1:37:21.880 --> 1:37:24.460\n then find the thing that you're passionate about\n\n1:37:24.460 --> 1:37:25.680\n and pursue it.\n\n1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:27.820\n And sometimes it's the thing that drives your life\n\n1:37:27.820 --> 1:37:29.040\n and sometimes it's secondary.\n\n1:37:29.040 --> 1:37:31.600\n And you'll do other things because you've got to eat, right?\n\n1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:32.800\n You've got a family, you've got to feed,\n\n1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:34.480\n you've got people you have to help or whatever.\n\n1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:36.360\n And I understand that and it's not easy for everyone,\n\n1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:39.760\n but always take a moment or two\n\n1:37:39.760 --> 1:37:42.520\n to pursue the things that you love,\n\n1:37:42.520 --> 1:37:45.400\n the things that bring passion and happiness to your life.\n\n1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:46.780\n And if you don't, I know that sounds corny,\n\n1:37:46.780 --> 1:37:47.960\n but I genuinely believe it.\n\n1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:49.880\n And if you don't have such a thing,\n\n1:37:49.880 --> 1:37:51.380\n then you're lying to yourself.\n\n1:37:51.380 --> 1:37:52.400\n You have such a thing.\n\n1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:53.480\n You just have to find it.\n\n1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:56.000\n And it's okay if it takes you a long time to get there.\n\n1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:00.360\n Rodney Dangerfield became a comedian in his 50s, I think.\n\n1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:01.760\n Certainly wasn't his 20s.\n\n1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:03.660\n And lots of people failed for a very long time\n\n1:38:03.660 --> 1:38:05.660\n before getting to where they were going.\n\n1:38:06.680 --> 1:38:09.740\n I try to have hope and it wasn't obvious.\n\n1:38:09.740 --> 1:38:13.760\n I mean, you and I talked about the experience that I had\n\n1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:17.480\n a long time ago with a particular police officer.\n\n1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:20.920\n Was it my first one and was it my last one?\n\n1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:24.160\n But in my view, I wasn't supposed to be here after that\n\n1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:25.000\n and I'm here.\n\n1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:25.920\n So it's all gravy.\n\n1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:29.000\n So you might as well go ahead and grab life as you can\n\n1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:29.840\n because of that.\n\n1:38:29.840 --> 1:38:31.200\n That's sort of how I see it.\n\n1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:34.480\n While recognizing, again, the delusion matters, right?\n\n1:38:34.480 --> 1:38:35.880\n Allow yourself to be deluded.\n\n1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.060\n Allow yourself to believe that it's all gonna work out.\n\n1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:41.700\n Just don't be so deluded that you miss the obvious.\n\n1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:43.440\n And you're gonna be fine.\n\n1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:44.860\n It's gonna be there.\n\n1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:45.700\n It's gonna be there.\n\n1:38:45.700 --> 1:38:46.600\n It's gonna work out.\n\n1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:47.980\n What do you think?\n\n1:38:47.980 --> 1:38:50.080\n I like to say choose your parents wisely\n\n1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:53.120\n because that has a big impact on your life.\n\n1:38:53.120 --> 1:38:54.560\n It's different.\n\n1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:57.360\n Yeah, I mean, there's a whole lot of things\n\n1:38:57.360 --> 1:38:58.440\n that you don't get to pick.\n\n1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:02.920\n And whether you get to have one kind of life\n\n1:39:02.920 --> 1:39:05.080\n or a different kind of life can depend a lot\n\n1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:06.840\n on things out of your control.\n\n1:39:06.840 --> 1:39:09.960\n But I really do believe in the passion, excitement thing.\n\n1:39:09.960 --> 1:39:11.920\n My, I was talking to my mom on the phone the other day\n\n1:39:11.920 --> 1:39:16.920\n and essentially what came out is that computer science\n\n1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.080\n is really popular right now.\n\n1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:25.880\n And I get to be a professor teaching something\n\n1:39:25.880 --> 1:39:28.840\n that's very attractive to people.\n\n1:39:28.840 --> 1:39:33.560\n And she was like trying to give me some appreciation\n\n1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:37.680\n for how foresightful I was for choosing this line of work\n\n1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:40.000\n as if somehow I knew that this is what was gonna happen\n\n1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.020\n in 2020, but that's not how it went for me at all.\n\n1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.540\n Like I studied computer science\n\n1:39:45.540 --> 1:39:47.900\n because I was just interested.\n\n1:39:47.900 --> 1:39:49.600\n It was just so interesting to me.\n\n1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:54.600\n I didn't think it would be particularly lucrative.\n\n1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:56.480\n And I've done everything I've can to keep it\n\n1:39:56.480 --> 1:39:58.380\n as unlucrative as possible.\n\n1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.600\n Some of my friends and colleagues have not done that.\n\n1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:07.880\n And I pride myself on my ability to remain unrich.\n\n1:40:07.880 --> 1:40:12.880\n But I do believe that, like I'm glad.\n\n1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:15.240\n I mean, I'm glad that it worked out for me.\n\n1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:17.920\n It could have been like, oh, what I was really fascinated by\n\n1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:19.300\n is this particular kind of engraving\n\n1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:20.680\n that nobody cares about.\n\n1:40:20.680 --> 1:40:22.800\n But so I got lucky and the thing that I cared about\n\n1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:24.120\n happened to be a thing that other people\n\n1:40:24.120 --> 1:40:25.320\n eventually cared about.\n\n1:40:26.300 --> 1:40:28.080\n But I don't think I would have had a fun time\n\n1:40:28.080 --> 1:40:29.180\n choosing anything else.\n\n1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:32.720\n Like this was the thing that kept me interested and engaged.\n\n1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:34.720\n Well, one thing that people tell me,\n\n1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:38.200\n especially around the early undergraduate,\n\n1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:41.560\n and the internet is part of the problem here,\n\n1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:44.840\n is they say they're passionate about so many things.\n\n1:40:44.840 --> 1:40:46.520\n How do I choose a thing?\n\n1:40:46.520 --> 1:40:50.280\n Which is a harder thing for me to know what to do with.\n\n1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:51.360\n Is there any?\n\n1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:54.400\n I mean, don't you know which, I mean, you know, look.\n\n1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:57.720\n A long time ago, I walked down a hallway\n\n1:40:57.720 --> 1:40:59.020\n and I took a left turn.\n\n1:40:59.020 --> 1:40:59.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:59.860 --> 1:41:01.320\n I could have taken a right turn.\n\n1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.800\n And my world could be better or it could be worse.\n\n1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:04.640\n I have no idea.\n\n1:41:04.640 --> 1:41:05.460\n I have no way of knowing.\n\n1:41:05.460 --> 1:41:07.080\n Is there anything about this particular hallway\n\n1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:09.080\n that's relevant or you're just in general choices?\n\n1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:09.920\n Yeah, you were on the left.\n\n1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:11.880\n It sounds like you regret not taking the right turn.\n\n1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:12.800\n Oh no, not at all.\n\n1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:13.920\n You brought it up.\n\n1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:16.460\n Well, because there was a turn there.\n\n1:41:16.460 --> 1:41:18.080\n On the left was Michael Newman's office, right?\n\n1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:20.080\n I mean, these sorts of things happen, right?\n\n1:41:20.080 --> 1:41:20.920\n But here's the thing.\n\n1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:22.640\n On the right, by the way, there was just a blank wall.\n\n1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:24.480\n It wasn't a huge choice.\n\n1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:25.320\n It would have really hurt.\n\n1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:26.280\n He tried first.\n\n1:41:26.280 --> 1:41:27.840\n No, but it's true, right?\n\n1:41:27.840 --> 1:41:29.840\n You know, I think about Ron Brockman, right?\n\n1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:33.320\n I went, I took a trip I wasn't supposed to take\n\n1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:38.100\n and I ended up talking to Ron about this\n\n1:41:38.100 --> 1:41:40.720\n and I ended up going down this entire path\n\n1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:42.840\n that allowed me to, I think, get tenure.\n\n1:41:42.840 --> 1:41:45.840\n But by the way, I decided to say yes to something\n\n1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:46.740\n that didn't make any sense\n\n1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:48.260\n and I went down this educational path.\n\n1:41:48.260 --> 1:41:50.480\n But it would have been, you know, who knows, right?\n\n1:41:50.480 --> 1:41:52.120\n Maybe if I hadn't done that,\n\n1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:54.320\n I would be a billionaire right now.\n\n1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:55.320\n I'd be Elon Musk.\n\n1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:57.020\n My life could be so much better.\n\n1:41:57.020 --> 1:41:59.560\n My life could also be so much worse.\n\n1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:01.600\n You know, you just gotta feel that sometimes\n\n1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:03.020\n you have decisions you're gonna make.\n\n1:42:03.020 --> 1:42:04.200\n You cannot know what's gonna do.\n\n1:42:04.200 --> 1:42:05.600\n You should think about it, right?\n\n1:42:05.600 --> 1:42:07.520\n Some things are clearly smarter than other things.\n\n1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.560\n You gotta play the odds a little bit.\n\n1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:11.600\n But in the end, if you've got multiple choices,\n\n1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:12.840\n there are lots of things you think you might love.\n\n1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:14.420\n Go with the thing that you actually love,\n\n1:42:14.420 --> 1:42:15.920\n the thing that jumps out at you\n\n1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:17.280\n and sort of pursue it for a little while.\n\n1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:18.960\n The worst thing that'll happen is you took a left turn\n\n1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:21.720\n instead of a right turn and you ended up merely happy.\n\n1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:23.580\n Beautiful.\n\n1:42:23.580 --> 1:42:26.620\n So, so accepting, so taking the step\n\n1:42:26.620 --> 1:42:28.480\n and just accepting, accepting that,\n\n1:42:28.480 --> 1:42:31.200\n that don't like question, question the choice.\n\n1:42:31.200 --> 1:42:36.200\n Life is long and there's time to actually pursue.\n\n1:42:36.600 --> 1:42:41.160\n Every once in a while, you have to put on a leather suit\n\n1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:43.040\n and make a thriller video.\n\n1:42:43.040 --> 1:42:44.280\n Every once in a while.\n\n1:42:44.280 --> 1:42:47.360\n If I ever get the chance again, I'm doing it.\n\n1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:48.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:50.960\n I was told that you actually dance,\n\n1:42:50.960 --> 1:42:53.800\n but that part was edited out.\n\n1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:54.640\n I don't dance.\n\n1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:59.160\n There was a thing where we did do the zombie thing.\n\n1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:00.640\n We did do the zombie thing.\n\n1:43:00.640 --> 1:43:01.920\n That wasn't edited out.\n\n1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:04.220\n It just wasn't put into the final thing.\n\n1:43:05.540 --> 1:43:06.380\n I'm quite happy.\n\n1:43:06.380 --> 1:43:07.520\n There was a reason for that too, right?\n\n1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:09.480\n Like I wasn't wearing something right.\n\n1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:10.320\n There was a reason for that.\n\n1:43:10.320 --> 1:43:11.160\n I can't remember what it was.\n\n1:43:11.160 --> 1:43:12.360\n No leather suit.\n\n1:43:12.360 --> 1:43:13.200\n Is that what it was?\n\n1:43:13.200 --> 1:43:14.020\n I can't remember.\n\n1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:16.040\n Anyway, the right thing happened.\n\n1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:16.880\n Exactly.\n\n1:43:16.880 --> 1:43:19.600\n You took the left turn and ended up being the right thing.\n\n1:43:19.600 --> 1:43:23.120\n So a lot of people ask me that are a little bit\n\n1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.480\n tangential to the programming and the computing world\n\n1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:28.280\n and they're interested to learn programming,\n\n1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:30.360\n like all kinds of disciplines that are outside\n\n1:43:30.360 --> 1:43:33.240\n of the particular discipline of computer science.\n\n1:43:33.240 --> 1:43:36.080\n What advice do you have for people\n\n1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.080\n that want to learn how to program\n\n1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:43.080\n or want to either taste this little skill set\n\n1:43:43.600 --> 1:43:47.240\n or discipline or try to see if it can be used somehow\n\n1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:48.880\n in their own life?\n\n1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:50.480\n What stage of life are they in?\n\n1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:55.040\n One of the magic things about the internet\n\n1:43:55.040 --> 1:43:58.160\n of the people that write me is I don't know.\n\n1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:00.520\n Because my answer's different for, my daughter\n\n1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:02.480\n is taking AP computer science right now.\n\n1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:03.560\n Hi, Joni.\n\n1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:06.340\n She's amazing and doing amazing things\n\n1:44:06.340 --> 1:44:08.040\n and my son's beginning to get interested\n\n1:44:08.040 --> 1:44:10.280\n and I'll be really curious where he takes it.\n\n1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:12.400\n I think his mind actually works very well\n\n1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:14.680\n for this sort of thing and she's doing great.\n\n1:44:14.680 --> 1:44:17.280\n But one of the things I have to tell her all the time,\n\n1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:19.880\n she points, well, I want to make a rhythm game.\n\n1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:23.320\n So I want to go for two weeks and then build a rhythm game.\n\n1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:25.240\n Show me how to build a rhythm game.\n\n1:44:25.240 --> 1:44:27.800\n Start small, learn the building blocks\n\n1:44:27.800 --> 1:44:28.920\n and how to take the time.\n\n1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:31.100\n Have patience, eventually you'll build a rhythm game.\n\n1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:34.100\n I was in grad school when I suddenly woke up one day\n\n1:44:34.100 --> 1:44:37.200\n over the Royal East and I thought, wait a minute,\n\n1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:38.040\n I'm a computer scientist.\n\n1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:39.740\n I should be able to write Pac Man in an afternoon.\n\n1:44:39.740 --> 1:44:42.040\n And I did, not with great graphics.\n\n1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:43.120\n It was actually a very cool game.\n\n1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:45.120\n I had to figure out how the ghost moved and everything\n\n1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:47.320\n and I did it in an afternoon in Pascal\n\n1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:48.800\n on an old Apple 2GS.\n\n1:44:49.920 --> 1:44:52.440\n But if I had started out trying to build Pac Man,\n\n1:44:52.440 --> 1:44:55.040\n I think it probably would have ended very poorly for me.\n\n1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:57.160\n Luckily back then, there weren't\n\n1:44:57.160 --> 1:44:58.920\n these magical devices we call phones\n\n1:44:58.920 --> 1:45:01.160\n and software everywhere to give me this illusion\n\n1:45:01.160 --> 1:45:03.480\n that I could create something by myself\n\n1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:05.760\n from the basics inside of a weekend like that.\n\n1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:09.440\n I mean, that was a culmination of years and years and years\n\n1:45:09.440 --> 1:45:11.200\n right before I decided, oh, I should be able to write this\n\n1:45:11.200 --> 1:45:12.140\n and I could.\n\n1:45:12.140 --> 1:45:16.920\n So my advice if you're early on is you've got the internet.\n\n1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:18.840\n There are lots of people there to give you the information.\n\n1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:20.540\n Find someone who cares about this.\n\n1:45:20.540 --> 1:45:22.640\n Remember, they've been doing it for a very long time.\n\n1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:25.660\n Take it slow, learn the little pieces, get excited about it\n\n1:45:25.660 --> 1:45:28.520\n and then keep the big project you want to build in mind.\n\n1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:29.640\n You'll get there soon enough.\n\n1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:32.820\n Because as a wise man once said, life is long.\n\n1:45:32.820 --> 1:45:35.640\n Sometimes it doesn't seem that long, but it is long\n\n1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:39.120\n and you'll have enough time to build it all out.\n\n1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:42.060\n All the information is out there, but start small.\n\n1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:44.720\n Generate Fibonacci numbers.\n\n1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:48.680\n That's not exciting, but it'll get you the language.\n\n1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:50.960\n Well, there's only one programming language, it's Lisp.\n\n1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:53.560\n But if you have to pick a programming language,\n\n1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:55.480\n I guess in today's day, what would I do?\n\n1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:56.800\n I guess I'd do.\n\n1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:00.600\n Python is basically Lisp, but with better syntax.\n\n1:46:00.600 --> 1:46:01.440\n Blasphemy.\n\n1:46:01.440 --> 1:46:03.800\n Yeah, with C syntax, how about that?\n\n1:46:03.800 --> 1:46:05.280\n So you're gonna argue that C syntax\n\n1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:07.080\n is better than anything?\n\n1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:10.200\n Anyway, also I'm gonna answer Python despite what he said.\n\n1:46:10.200 --> 1:46:12.560\n Tell your story about somebody's dissertation\n\n1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:14.640\n that had a Lisp program in it.\n\n1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:15.480\n It was so funny.\n\n1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:17.920\n This is Dave's, Dave's dissertation was like,\n\n1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:20.120\n Dave McAllister, who was a professor at MIT for a while\n\n1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:24.120\n and then he came to Bell Labs and now he's at\n\n1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:26.360\n Technology Technical Institute of Chicago.\n\n1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:27.920\n A brilliant guy.\n\n1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:28.880\n Such an interesting guy.\n\n1:46:28.880 --> 1:46:33.880\n Anyway, his thesis, it was a theorem prover\n\n1:46:33.920 --> 1:46:38.400\n and he decided to have as an appendix his actual code,\n\n1:46:38.400 --> 1:46:39.640\n which of course was all written in Lisp\n\n1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:40.920\n because of course it was.\n\n1:46:40.920 --> 1:46:43.680\n And like the last 20 pages are just right parenthesis.\n\n1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:47.120\n It's just wonderful.\n\n1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:48.720\n That's programming right there.\n\n1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:51.000\n Pages upon pages of right parenthesis.\n\n1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:52.860\n Anyway, Lisp is the only real language,\n\n1:46:52.860 --> 1:46:54.400\n but I understand that that's not necessarily\n\n1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:56.000\n the place where you start.\n\n1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:57.720\n Python is just fine.\n\n1:46:57.720 --> 1:46:59.000\n Python is good.\n\n1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:00.680\n If you're, you know, of a certain age,\n\n1:47:00.680 --> 1:47:02.260\n if you're really young and trying to figure it out,\n\n1:47:02.260 --> 1:47:04.000\n graphical languages that let you kind of see\n\n1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:05.920\n how the thing works and that's fine too.\n\n1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:06.760\n They're all fine.\n\n1:47:06.760 --> 1:47:07.580\n It almost doesn't matter.\n\n1:47:07.580 --> 1:47:09.000\n But there are people who spend a lot of time\n\n1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:13.040\n thinking about how to build languages that get people in.\n\n1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:14.840\n The question is, are you trying to get in\n\n1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:15.880\n and figure out what it is?\n\n1:47:15.880 --> 1:47:18.160\n Or do you already know what you want?\n\n1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:19.920\n And that's why I asked you what stage of life people are in\n\n1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:21.200\n because if you're different stages of life,\n\n1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:23.360\n you would attack it differently.\n\n1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:25.360\n The answer to that question of which language\n\n1:47:25.360 --> 1:47:27.960\n keeps changing, I mean, there's some value\n\n1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:32.960\n to exploring, a lot of people write to me about Julia.\n\n1:47:33.080 --> 1:47:35.240\n There's these like more modern languages\n\n1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:39.080\n that keep being invented, Rust and Kotlin.\n\n1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:42.280\n There's stuff that, for people who love\n\n1:47:42.280 --> 1:47:44.880\n functional languages like Lisp,\n\n1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:46.920\n that apparently there's echoes of that,\n\n1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:49.400\n but much better in the modern languages.\n\n1:47:49.400 --> 1:47:51.720\n And it's worthwhile to,\n\n1:47:51.720 --> 1:47:53.360\n especially when you're learning languages,\n\n1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:55.320\n it feels like it's okay to try one\n\n1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.840\n that's not like the popular one.\n\n1:47:57.840 --> 1:47:59.160\n Oh yeah, but you want something simple.\n\n1:47:59.160 --> 1:48:02.180\n And I think you get that way of thinking\n\n1:48:02.180 --> 1:48:04.500\n almost no matter what language.\n\n1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:06.520\n And if you push far enough,\n\n1:48:06.520 --> 1:48:08.040\n like it can be assembly language,\n\n1:48:08.040 --> 1:48:09.560\n but you need to push pretty far\n\n1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:11.520\n before you start to hit the really deep concepts\n\n1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:13.400\n that you would get sooner in other languages.\n\n1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:16.600\n But like, I don't know, computation is kind of computation,\n\n1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:19.520\n is kind of Turing equivalent, is kind of computation.\n\n1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:22.220\n And so it matters how you express things,\n\n1:48:22.220 --> 1:48:24.440\n but you have to build out that mental structure\n\n1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:25.440\n in your mind.\n\n1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:28.800\n And I don't think it's super matters which language.\n\n1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:29.940\n I mean, it matters a little,\n\n1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:31.000\n because some things are just\n\n1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:32.240\n at the wrong level of abstraction.\n\n1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:33.840\n I think assembly is at the wrong level of abstraction\n\n1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:35.920\n for someone coming in new.\n\n1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:37.360\n I think that if you start.\n\n1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:38.400\n For someone coming in new.\n\n1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:42.640\n Yes, for frameworks, big frameworks are quite a bit.\n\n1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:43.640\n You know, you've got to get to the point\n\n1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:44.940\n where I want to learn a new language,\n\n1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:46.180\n means I just pick up a reference book\n\n1:48:46.180 --> 1:48:49.240\n and I think of a project and I go through it in a weekend.\n\n1:48:49.240 --> 1:48:50.320\n Right, you got to get there.\n\n1:48:50.320 --> 1:48:52.400\n You're right though, the languages that are designed\n\n1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:54.920\n for that are, it almost doesn't matter.\n\n1:48:54.920 --> 1:48:57.800\n Pick the ones that people have built tutorials\n\n1:48:57.800 --> 1:48:59.760\n and infrastructure around to help you get kind of,\n\n1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:00.840\n kind of ease into it.\n\n1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:01.680\n Because it's hard.\n\n1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:03.480\n I mean, I did this little experiment once.\n\n1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:08.560\n I was teaching intro to CS in the summer as a favor.\n\n1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:11.920\n Which is, anyway.\n\n1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:12.760\n I was teaching.\n\n1:49:12.760 --> 1:49:15.120\n I was teaching intro to CS as a favor.\n\n1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:17.000\n And it was very funny because I'd go in every single time\n\n1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:18.800\n and I would think to myself,\n\n1:49:18.800 --> 1:49:21.560\n how am I possibly going to fill up an hour and a half\n\n1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:23.120\n talking about for loops, right?\n\n1:49:23.120 --> 1:49:25.240\n And there wasn't enough time.\n\n1:49:25.240 --> 1:49:26.660\n Took me a while to realize this, right?\n\n1:49:26.660 --> 1:49:27.920\n There are only three things, right?\n\n1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:29.120\n There's reading from a variable,\n\n1:49:29.120 --> 1:49:31.580\n writing to a variable and conditional branching.\n\n1:49:31.580 --> 1:49:34.100\n Everything else is syntactic sugar, right?\n\n1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:36.080\n The syntactic sugar matters, but that's it.\n\n1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:38.960\n And when I say that's it, I don't mean it's simple.\n\n1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:40.120\n I mean, it's hard.\n\n1:49:40.120 --> 1:49:43.480\n Like conditional branching, loops, variable.\n\n1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:45.200\n Those are really hard concepts.\n\n1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:47.240\n So you shouldn't be discouraged by this.\n\n1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.080\n Here's a simple experiment.\n\n1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:49.280\n I'm gonna ask you a question now.\n\n1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:50.720\n You ready?\n\n1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:51.680\n X equals three.\n\n1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:52.520\n Okay.\n\n1:49:53.440 --> 1:49:54.960\n Y equals four.\n\n1:49:54.960 --> 1:49:55.800\n Okay.\n\n1:49:55.800 --> 1:49:57.080\n What is X?\n\n1:49:57.080 --> 1:49:57.920\n Three.\n\n1:49:57.920 --> 1:49:59.040\n What is Y?\n\n1:49:59.040 --> 1:49:59.880\n Four.\n\n1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:00.700\n Y equals X.\n\n1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:01.540\n I'm gonna mess this up.\n\n1:50:01.540 --> 1:50:02.620\n No, it's easy.\n\n1:50:02.620 --> 1:50:04.020\n Y equals X.\n\n1:50:04.020 --> 1:50:04.860\n Y equals X.\n\n1:50:04.860 --> 1:50:05.680\n What is Y?\n\n1:50:07.880 --> 1:50:08.720\n Three.\n\n1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:09.560\n That's right.\n\n1:50:09.560 --> 1:50:10.380\n X equals seven.\n\n1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:12.520\n What is Y?\n\n1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:15.540\n That's one of the trickiest things to get for programmers,\n\n1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:19.240\n that there's a memory and the variables are pointing\n\n1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:21.040\n to a particular thing in memory,\n\n1:50:21.040 --> 1:50:23.240\n and sometimes the languages hide that from you\n\n1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:24.360\n and they bring it closer\n\n1:50:24.360 --> 1:50:26.640\n to the way you think mathematics works.\n\n1:50:26.640 --> 1:50:28.480\n Right, so in fact, Mark Guzdal,\n\n1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:30.040\n who worries about these sorts of things,\n\n1:50:30.040 --> 1:50:32.440\n or used to worry about these sorts of things anyway,\n\n1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:35.560\n had this kind of belief that actually,\n\n1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:36.960\n people when they see these statements,\n\n1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:39.560\n X equals something, Y equals something, Y equals X,\n\n1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:42.900\n that you have now made a mathematical statement\n\n1:50:42.900 --> 1:50:44.200\n that Y and X are the same.\n\n1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:48.080\n Which you can if you just put like an anchor in front of it.\n\n1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:51.400\n Yes, but people, that's not what you're doing, right?\n\n1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:54.040\n I thought, and I kind of asked the question,\n\n1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:55.480\n and I think I had some evidence for this,\n\n1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:56.600\n it's hardly a study,\n\n1:50:56.600 --> 1:50:59.240\n is that most of the people who didn't know the answer,\n\n1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:02.240\n weren't sure about the answer, they had used spreadsheets.\n\n1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:03.480\n Ah, interesting.\n\n1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.380\n And so it's, you know,\n\n1:51:06.380 --> 1:51:10.920\n it's by reference, or by name really, right?\n\n1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:13.280\n And so depending upon what you think they are,\n\n1:51:13.280 --> 1:51:14.720\n you get completely different answers.\n\n1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:17.860\n The fact that I could go, or one could go,\n\n1:51:17.860 --> 1:51:20.120\n two thirds of the way through a semester,\n\n1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:22.560\n and people still hadn't figured out in their heads,\n\n1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:25.080\n when you say Y equals X, what that meant,\n\n1:51:25.080 --> 1:51:27.100\n tells you it's actually hard.\n\n1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:29.080\n Because all those answers are possible,\n\n1:51:29.080 --> 1:51:30.100\n and in fact, when you said,\n\n1:51:30.100 --> 1:51:31.800\n oh, if you just put an ampersand in front of it,\n\n1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:33.680\n I mean, that doesn't make any sense for an intro class,\n\n1:51:33.680 --> 1:51:34.720\n and of course a lot of languages\n\n1:51:34.720 --> 1:51:35.720\n don't even give you the ability\n\n1:51:35.720 --> 1:51:37.320\n to think about it in terms of ampersand.\n\n1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:38.920\n Do we want to have a 45 minute discussion\n\n1:51:38.920 --> 1:51:42.360\n about the difference between equal EQ and equal in Lisp?\n\n1:51:42.360 --> 1:51:43.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:43.200 --> 1:51:44.020\n I know you do.\n\n1:51:44.020 --> 1:51:44.860\n No.\n\n1:51:44.860 --> 1:51:47.440\n But you know, you could do that.\n\n1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:49.160\n This is actually really hard stuff.\n\n1:51:49.160 --> 1:51:52.360\n So you shouldn't be, it's not too hard, we all do it,\n\n1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:53.920\n but you shouldn't be discouraged.\n\n1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:55.320\n It's why you should start small,\n\n1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:56.600\n so that you can figure out these things,\n\n1:51:56.600 --> 1:51:58.380\n so you have the right model in your head,\n\n1:51:58.380 --> 1:51:59.960\n so that when you write the language,\n\n1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:02.020\n you can execute it, and build the machine\n\n1:52:02.020 --> 1:52:03.280\n that you want to build, right?\n\n1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:05.200\n Yeah, the funny thing about programming,\n\n1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:06.960\n and those very basic things,\n\n1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:11.160\n is the very basics are not often made explicit,\n\n1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:13.880\n which is actually what drives everybody away\n\n1:52:13.880 --> 1:52:15.320\n from basically any discipline,\n\n1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:17.040\n but programming is just another one.\n\n1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:19.360\n Like even a simpler version of the equal sign\n\n1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.740\n that I kind of forget, is in mathematics,\n\n1:52:23.740 --> 1:52:25.480\n equals is not assignment.\n\n1:52:25.480 --> 1:52:26.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:30.260\n Like, I think basically every single programming language\n\n1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:33.080\n with just a few handful of exceptions,\n\n1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:35.160\n equals is assignment.\n\n1:52:35.160 --> 1:52:38.840\n And you have some other operator for equality.\n\n1:52:38.840 --> 1:52:41.740\n And even that, like everyone kind of knows it,\n\n1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:45.020\n once you started doing it,\n\n1:52:45.020 --> 1:52:47.120\n but like you need to say that explicitly,\n\n1:52:47.120 --> 1:52:51.000\n or you just realize it, like yourself.\n\n1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:53.240\n Otherwise you might be stuck for,\n\n1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:54.680\n you said like half a semester,\n\n1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:57.160\n you could be stuck for quite a long time.\n\n1:52:57.160 --> 1:53:00.320\n And I think also part of the programming\n\n1:53:00.320 --> 1:53:04.520\n is being okay in that state of confusion for a while.\n\n1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.720\n It's to the debugging point.\n\n1:53:06.720 --> 1:53:09.800\n It's like, I just wrote two lines of code,\n\n1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:10.980\n why doesn't this work?\n\n1:53:10.980 --> 1:53:13.400\n And staring at that for like hours,\n\n1:53:14.640 --> 1:53:15.800\n and trying to figure out.\n\n1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:16.960\n And then every once in a while,\n\n1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:18.480\n you just have to restart your computer\n\n1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:19.540\n and everything works again.\n\n1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:24.200\n And then you just kind of stare into the void\n\n1:53:24.200 --> 1:53:26.600\n with the tear slowly rolling down your eye.\n\n1:53:26.600 --> 1:53:28.200\n By the way, the fact that they didn't get this\n\n1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:30.000\n actually had no impact on,\n\n1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.360\n I mean, they were still able to do their assignments.\n\n1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:35.080\n Because it turns out their misunderstanding\n\n1:53:35.080 --> 1:53:37.600\n wasn't being revealed to them\n\n1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:39.840\n by the problem sets we were giving them.\n\n1:53:39.840 --> 1:53:41.360\n It's pretty profound actually, yeah.\n\n1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:44.400\n I wrote a program a long time ago,\n\n1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:46.360\n actually for my master's thesis,\n\n1:53:46.360 --> 1:53:49.400\n and in C++ I think, or C, I guess it was C.\n\n1:53:49.400 --> 1:53:51.720\n And it was all memory management and terrible.\n\n1:53:52.720 --> 1:53:55.440\n And it wouldn't work for a while.\n\n1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:57.480\n And it was some kind of,\n\n1:53:57.480 --> 1:53:59.680\n it was clear to me that it was overriding memory.\n\n1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:01.400\n And I just couldn't, I was like,\n\n1:54:01.400 --> 1:54:03.360\n look, I got to pay for this time for this.\n\n1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:06.560\n So I basically declared a variable\n\n1:54:06.560 --> 1:54:10.160\n at the front in the main that was like 400K,\n\n1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:12.480\n just an array, and it worked.\n\n1:54:12.480 --> 1:54:14.340\n Because wherever I was scribbling over memory,\n\n1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:17.120\n it would scribble into that space and it didn't matter.\n\n1:54:17.120 --> 1:54:19.640\n And so I never figured out what the bug was.\n\n1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:21.840\n But I did create something to sort of deal with it.\n\n1:54:21.840 --> 1:54:22.720\n To work around it.\n\n1:54:22.720 --> 1:54:25.640\n And it, you know, that's crazy, that's crazy.\n\n1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:27.240\n It was okay, because that's what I wanted.\n\n1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:29.320\n But I knew enough about memory managed to go,\n\n1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:30.900\n you know, management to go, you know,\n\n1:54:30.900 --> 1:54:32.240\n I'm just going to create an empty array here\n\n1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:34.760\n and hope that that deals with this scribbling memory problem.\n\n1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:35.600\n And it did.\n\n1:54:35.600 --> 1:54:36.960\n That takes a long time to figure out.\n\n1:54:36.960 --> 1:54:38.520\n And by the way, the language you first learned\n\n1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:39.800\n probably just garbage collection anyway,\n\n1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:41.080\n so you're not even going to come up across,\n\n1:54:41.080 --> 1:54:43.500\n you're not going to come across that problem.\n\n1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:46.080\n So we talked about the Minsky idea\n\n1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:49.580\n of hating everything you do and hating yourself.\n\n1:54:49.580 --> 1:54:52.600\n So let's end on a question\n\n1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:54.760\n that's going to make both of you very uncomfortable.\n\n1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:55.600\n Okay.\n\n1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:58.000\n Which is, what is your, Charles,\n\n1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:01.880\n what's your favorite thing that you're grateful for\n\n1:55:01.880 --> 1:55:04.280\n about Michael?\n\n1:55:04.280 --> 1:55:06.680\n And Michael, what is your favorite thing\n\n1:55:06.680 --> 1:55:09.640\n that you're grateful for about Charles?\n\n1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:12.120\n Well, that answer is actually quite easy.\n\n1:55:12.120 --> 1:55:12.940\n His friendship.\n\n1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:15.320\n He stole the easy answer.\n\n1:55:15.320 --> 1:55:16.160\n I did.\n\n1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.400\n Yeah, I can tell you what I hate about Charles,\n\n1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:19.440\n he steals my good answers.\n\n1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:21.120\n The thing I like most about Charles,\n\n1:55:21.120 --> 1:55:24.080\n he sees the world in a similar enough,\n\n1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:25.720\n but different way that I,\n\n1:55:25.720 --> 1:55:28.880\n it's sort of like having another life.\n\n1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:31.400\n It's sort of like I get to experience things\n\n1:55:31.400 --> 1:55:32.920\n that I wouldn't otherwise get to experience\n\n1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:36.040\n because I would not naturally gravitate to them that way.\n\n1:55:36.040 --> 1:55:39.080\n And so he just, he just shows me a whole other world.\n\n1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:39.920\n It's awesome.\n\n1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:44.080\n Yeah, the inner product is not zero for sure.\n\n1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:47.540\n It's not quite one, 0.7 maybe.\n\n1:55:47.540 --> 1:55:49.320\n Just enough that you can learn.\n\n1:55:50.720 --> 1:55:53.060\n Just enough that you can learn.\n\n1:55:53.060 --> 1:55:54.320\n That's the definition of friendship.\n\n1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:55.720\n The inner product is 0.7.\n\n1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:56.680\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n1:55:56.680 --> 1:55:58.120\n That's the answer to life really.\n\n1:55:58.120 --> 1:55:59.360\n Charles sometimes believes in me\n\n1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:01.360\n when I have not believed in me.\n\n1:56:01.360 --> 1:56:04.360\n He also sometimes works as an outward confidence\n\n1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.760\n that he has so much, so much confidence and self,\n\n1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:11.360\n I don't know, comfortableness.\n\n1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:13.000\n Okay, let's go with that.\n\n1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.080\n That I feel better a little bit.\n\n1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:17.680\n If he thinks I'm okay,\n\n1:56:17.680 --> 1:56:20.240\n then maybe I'm not as bad as I think I am.\n\n1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:24.620\n At the end of the day, luck favors the Charles.\n\n1:56:24.620 --> 1:56:26.720\n It's a huge honor to talk with you.\n\n1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:29.320\n Thank you so much for taking this time,\n\n1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:30.740\n wasting your time with me.\n\n1:56:30.740 --> 1:56:32.160\n It was an awesome conversation.\n\n1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:35.240\n You guys are an inspiration to a huge number of

well.\n\n1:56:38.940 --> 1:56:39.780\n Thank you so much.\n\n1:56:39.780 --> 1:56:40.600\n And by the way, if luck favors the Charles,\n\n1:56:40.600 --> 1:56:41.440\n then it's certainly the case\n\n1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:43.840\n that I've been very lucky to know you.\n\n1:56:43.840 --> 1:56:45.240\n I'm gonna edit that part out.\n\n1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:49.360\n Thanks for listening to
