Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets.\n\n00:06.880 --> 00:16.000\n Employees produce a surplus which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:26.240\n class structures because one class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another\n\n00:26.240 --> 00:34.720\n group of people, not the ones who produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger,\n\n00:34.720 --> 00:41.280\n resentment, and all of the problems you can lump under the heading class struggle.\n\n00:43.680 --> 00:49.440\n The following is a conversation with Richard Wolff, one of the top Marxist economists and\n\n00:49.440 --> 00:57.360\n philosophers in the world. This is a heavy topic, in general and for me personally, given my family\n\n00:57.360 --> 01:04.800\n history in the Soviet Union, in Russia, and in Ukraine. Today the words Marxism, Socialism,\n\n01:04.800 --> 01:11.680\n and Communism are used to attack and to divide, much more than to understand and to learn.\n\n01:11.680 --> 01:18.320\n With this podcast, I seek the latter. I believe we need to study the ideas of Karl Marx,\n\n01:18.320 --> 01:23.520\n as well as their various implementations throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:29.520\n And in general, we need to both steel man and to consider seriously the ideas we demonize,\n\n01:30.400 --> 01:37.440\n and to challenge the ideas we dogmatically accept as true, even when doing so is unpleasant,\n\n01:37.440 --> 01:44.160\n and at times, dangerous. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our\n\n01:44.160 --> 01:49.920\n sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Richard Wolff.\n\n01:50.720 --> 01:56.960\n Let's start with a basic question, but maybe not so basic after all. What is Marxism? What are the\n\n01:56.960 --> 02:02.800\n defining characteristics of Marxism as an economic and political theory and ideology?\n\n02:02.800 --> 02:08.880\n Well, the simplest way to begin a definition would be to say it's the tradition that takes its\n\n02:09.760 --> 02:20.480\n founding inspiration from the works of Karl Marx. But because these ideas that he put forward\n\n02:21.440 --> 02:30.720\n spread as fast as they did, and as globally as they did, literally it's 140 years,\n\n02:30.720 --> 02:41.360\n 140 years since Marx died. And in that time, his ideas have become major types of thinking\n\n02:41.360 --> 02:47.600\n in every country on the earth. If you know much about the great ideas of human history,\n\n02:49.200 --> 02:56.800\n that's an extraordinary spread in an extraordinarily short period of historical time.\n\n02:56.800 --> 03:05.040\n And what that has meant, that speed of spread and that geographic diversity, is that the Marxian\n\n03:05.040 --> 03:12.960\n ideas interacted with very different cultural histories, religious histories, and economic\n\n03:12.960 --> 03:20.160\n conditions. So the end result was that the ideas were interpreted differently in different places\n\n03:20.160 --> 03:29.200\n at different times. And therefore, Marxism, as a kind of first flush definition, is the totality\n\n03:29.200 --> 03:39.200\n of all of these very different ways of coming to terms with it. For the first roughly 40, 50 years,\n\n03:40.560 --> 03:48.240\n Marxism was a tradition of thinking critically about capitalism. Marx himself, that's all he\n\n03:48.240 --> 03:53.760\n really did. He never wrote a book about communism. He never wrote a book really about socialism.\n\n03:53.760 --> 04:01.600\n Either his comments were occasional, fragmentary, dispersed. What he was really interested in was\n\n04:01.600 --> 04:09.760\n a critical analysis of capitalism. And that's what Marxism was, more or less, in its first 40 or 50\n\n04:09.760 --> 04:19.760\n years. The only qualification of what I just said was something that happened in Paris for a few\n\n04:19.760 --> 04:29.200\n weeks. In 1871, there was a collapse of the French government, consequent upon losing a war to Bismarck's\n\n04:29.200 --> 04:35.600\n Germany. And then the result was something called the Paris Commune. The working class of Paris\n\n04:35.600 --> 04:43.120\n rose up, basically took over the function of running the Parisian economy and the Parisian\n\n04:43.120 --> 04:50.560\n society. And Marx's people, people influenced by Marx, were very active in that commune,\n\n04:50.560 --> 04:55.120\n in the leadership of the commune. And Marx wasn't that far away. He was in London.\n\n04:56.240 --> 05:02.640\n These things were happening in Paris. That's an easy transport even then. And for a short time,\n\n05:02.640 --> 05:11.920\n very short, Marxism had a different quality. In addition to being a critique of capitalism,\n\n05:11.920 --> 05:21.240\n it became a theory of how to organize society differently. Before that had only been implicit.\n\n05:21.240 --> 05:28.800\n Now it became explicit. What is the leadership of the Paris Commune going to do? And why? And\n\n05:28.800 --> 05:36.080\n in what order? And in other words, governing, organizing a society. But since it only lasted\n\n05:36.080 --> 05:43.120\n a few weeks, the French army regrouped. And under the leadership of people who were very opposed to\n\n05:43.120 --> 05:51.120\n Marx, they marched back into Paris, took over, killed a large number of the communards, as they\n\n05:51.120 --> 05:57.680\n were called, and deported them to islands in the Pacific that were part of the French empire at the\n\n05:57.680 --> 06:06.720\n time. The really big change happens in Russia in 1917. Now you have a group of Marxists, Lenin,\n\n06:06.720 --> 06:17.120\n Trotsky, all the rest, who are in this bizarre position to seize a moment. Once again, a war,\n\n06:17.120 --> 06:25.120\n like in France, disorganizes the government, throws the government into a very bad reputation\n\n06:25.120 --> 06:31.120\n because it is the government that loses World War I, has to withdraw, as you know,\n\n06:31.760 --> 06:36.960\n Brest, Litovsk and all of that, and the government collapses and the army revolts.\n\n06:37.760 --> 06:46.240\n And in that situation, a very small political party, Russian Social Democratic Workers Party,\n\n06:46.240 --> 06:56.400\n splits, under the pressures of all of this, into the Bolshevik and Menshevik divisions. Lenin,\n\n06:56.400 --> 07:00.640\n Trotsky and the others are in the Bolshevik division. And to make a long story short,\n\n07:00.640 --> 07:09.600\n he's in exile. Lenin's position gets him deported because he says Russian workers should not be\n\n07:09.600 --> 07:16.640\n killing German workers. I mean, this is a war of capitalists who are dividing the world up into\n\n07:16.640 --> 07:24.000\n colonies and Russian working people should not kill and should not die for such a thing. As you\n\n07:24.000 --> 07:30.160\n can expect, they arrest him and they throw him out. Interestingly, in the United States, the\n\n07:30.160 --> 07:36.560\n comparable leader at that time of the Socialist Party here, as you know, there was no Communist\n\n07:36.560 --> 07:42.320\n Party at this point, that comes later. The head of the Socialist Party, a very important American\n\n07:42.320 --> 07:50.240\n figure named Eugene Victor Debs, makes exactly the same argument that Americans should not fight in\n\n07:50.240 --> 07:57.040\n the war. He has nothing to do with Lenin, I don't even know if they knew of each other, but he does\n\n07:57.040 --> 08:02.560\n it on his own. He gets arrested and put in jail here in the United States. By the way, he runs for\n\n08:02.560 --> 08:09.360\n president from jail and does very well, really very well, remarkable. And he's the inspiration\n\n08:09.360 --> 08:18.080\n for Bernie Sanders, if you see the link, although he had much more courage politically than Bernie\n\n08:18.080 --> 08:24.160\n has. That's really interesting. I'd love to return to that link maybe later. History rhymes. Yes,\n\n08:24.160 --> 08:32.800\n the complicated story. Anyway, the importance in terms of Marxism is that now this seizure of power\n\n08:32.800 --> 08:40.160\n by a group of Marxists, that is a group of people inspired by Marx developing what you might call\n\n08:40.160 --> 08:46.560\n a Russian, even though there were differences among the Russians too, but a Russian interpretation,\n\n08:46.560 --> 08:54.720\n this now has to be transformed from a critique of capitalism into a plan, at least. What are you\n\n08:54.720 --> 09:02.720\n going to do in the Soviet Union? And a lot of this was then trial and error. Marx never laid any of\n\n09:02.720 --> 09:08.160\n this out. Probably wouldn't have been all that relevant if he had, because it was 50 years\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:15.200\n earlier in another country, etc. So what begins to happen, and you can see how this happens then\n\n09:15.200 --> 09:23.440\n more later in China and Cuba and Vietnam and Korea and so on, is that you have kind of a bifurcation.\n\n09:24.160 --> 09:34.080\n Much of Marxism remains chiefly the critique of capitalism, but another part of it becomes a set,\n\n09:34.080 --> 09:40.960\n and they differ from one to the other, a set of notions of what an alternative post capitalist\n\n09:40.960 --> 09:47.600\n society ought to look like, how it ought to work. And there's lots of disagreement about it,\n\n09:48.160 --> 09:54.720\n lots of confusion, and I would say that that's still where it is. You have a tradition now\n\n09:55.280 --> 10:01.760\n that has these two major wings, critique of capitalism, notion of the alternative,\n\n10:01.760 --> 10:07.680\n and then a variety of each of those, and that would be the framework in which I would answer,\n\n10:07.680 --> 10:14.800\n that's what Marxism is about. Its basic idea, if you had to have one, is that human society\n\n10:15.600 --> 10:18.800\n can do better than capitalism, and it ought to try.\n\n10:19.520 --> 10:23.680\n And then we can start to talk about what we mean by capitalism.\n\n10:23.680 --> 10:24.180\n Fine.\n\n10:25.280 --> 10:30.880\n So we'll look at the critique of capitalism on one side, but maybe stepping back,\n\n10:30.880 --> 10:37.440\n what do you think Marx would say if he just looked at the different implementations of the ideas that\n\n10:37.440 --> 10:42.640\n Marxism throughout the 20th century, where his ideas that were implicit were made explicit?\n\n10:46.800 --> 10:52.800\n Would he shake his head? Would he enjoy some of the parts of the implementations? How do you think\n\n10:52.800 --> 10:54.000\n he would analyze it?\n\n10:54.000 --> 10:57.920\n Well, he had a great sense of humor. I don't know if he had a chance to take a look at his writing,\n\n10:57.920 --> 11:03.680\n but he had an extraordinary sense of humorism. My guess is he would deploy his humor in answering\n\n11:03.680 --> 11:10.000\n this question, too. He would say some of them are inspiring, some of his interpretations of his work,\n\n11:10.000 --> 11:16.320\n and he's very pleased with those. Others are horrifying, and he wishes somehow he could\n\n11:16.320 --> 11:22.880\n erase the connection between those things and the lineage they claim from him, which he would.\n\n11:24.400 --> 11:29.520\n There's a German word\u2014I don't know if you speak the other languages\u2014there's a wonderful\n\n11:29.520 --> 11:36.480\n German word called verzichte, and it's stronger than the word refuse. It's if you want to refuse\n\n11:36.480 --> 11:43.200\n something, but with real strong emphasis. Verzichte darauf is a German way of saying,\n\n11:43.200 --> 11:45.440\n I don't want anything to do with that.\n\n11:46.240 --> 11:51.600\n He would talk then in philosophical terms, because remember, he was a student of philosophy.\n\n11:51.600 --> 11:57.760\n He wrote his doctoral thesis on ancient Greek philosophy and all the rest. He would wax\n\n11:57.760 --> 12:04.560\n philosophical and say, you know, that the ideas you put out are a little bit like having a child.\n\n12:04.560 --> 12:10.640\n You have a lot of influence, but the child is his own or her own person and will find his or\n\n12:10.640 --> 12:17.280\n her own way, and these ideas, once they're out there, go their own way. And as you said, there's\n\n12:17.280 --> 12:22.240\n a particular way that this idea spread, the speed at which it spread throughout the world made it\n\n12:22.240 --> 12:29.120\n even less able to be sort of stabilized and connected back to the origins of where the idea\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:35.520\n came from. The only people who ever really tried that were the Russians after the revolution,\n\n12:35.520 --> 12:41.360\n because they occupied a position for a while, not very long, but they occupied a position for a\n\n12:41.360 --> 12:46.560\n while in which, I mean, it was exalted, right? There had been all these people criticizing\n\n12:46.560 --> 12:53.360\n capitalism for a long time, even the Marxists ever since mid century. And these were the first guys\n\n12:53.920 --> 13:00.240\n who pulled it off. They made it. And so that there was a kind of presumption around the world,\n\n13:00.240 --> 13:08.560\n their interpretation must be kind of the right one, because look, they did it. And so for a while,\n\n13:08.560 --> 13:18.400\n they could enunciate their interpretation. And it came to be widely grasped as something which,\n\n13:18.400 --> 13:23.920\n by the way, gets called in the literature, official Marxism, the very idea that you would\n\n13:23.920 --> 13:30.960\n put that adjective in front of Marxism, or Soviet Marxism or Russian, there were these words that\n\n13:31.840 --> 13:37.920\n where the adjective was meant to somehow say, kind of, this is the canon, you can depart from\n\n13:37.920 --> 13:44.640\n it, but this is the canon. Before the Russian Revolution, there was no such thing. And by the\n\n13:44.640 --> 13:54.240\n 1960s, it was already, it was gone. But for a short time, 30, 40 years, it was a kind of,\n\n13:54.960 --> 14:02.080\n and the irony is, particularly here in the United States, where the taboo against Marxism kicks in\n\n14:02.080 --> 14:09.760\n right after World War II, is so total in this country, that I, for example, through most of\n\n14:09.760 --> 14:18.640\n my adult life, have had to spend a ridiculous amount of my time simply explaining to American\n\n14:18.640 --> 14:28.880\n audiences that the Marxism they take as canonical is that old Soviet Marxism, which wasn't the canon\n\n14:28.880 --> 14:36.960\n before 1917, and hasn't been since at least the 1960s. But they don't know. It's not that they're\n\n14:36.960 --> 14:42.000\n stupid, and it's not that they're ignorant. It's that, well, ignorance may be, but I mean, it's not\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:49.680\n a mental problem. It's the taboo. Shut it down. And so all of the reopening that, in a way,\n\n14:49.680 --> 14:55.440\n recaptures what went before and develops it in new direction, they just don't know.\n\n14:55.440 --> 15:03.200\n LW. Nevertheless, it's a serious attempt at making the implicit ideas explicit. The Russians,\n\n15:04.240 --> 15:10.320\n the Soviets at the beginning of the 20th century, made a serious attempt at saying, okay, beyond the\n\n15:10.320 --> 15:14.960\n critique of capitalism, how do we actually build a system like this? And so, in that sense,\n\n15:16.720 --> 15:22.720\n not at a high level, but at a detailed level, it's interesting to look at those particular schools.\n\n15:22.720 --> 15:27.760\n Maybe\u2026 RL. Right, because, for example, let me just take your point one step further. You really\n\n15:27.760 --> 15:34.720\n cannot understand the Cuban Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, Vietnamese, and the others,\n\n15:34.720 --> 15:43.600\n because each of them is a kind of response, let's call it, to the way the Soviets did it.\n\n15:43.600 --> 15:50.400\n Are you going to do it that way? Well, yes, and no is the answer. This we will do that way,\n\n15:50.400 --> 15:56.960\n but that we're not going to do. And the differences are huge, but you could find a thread\u2014I can do\n\n15:56.960 --> 16:04.000\n that for you if you want\u2014in which all of them are, in a way, reacting. LW. To the originals.\n\n16:04.000 --> 16:09.920\n RL. Yes, very much so. LW. Like maybe most of rock music is reacting to the Beatles and the Stones.\n\n16:09.920 --> 16:16.000\n RL. Something like that. LW. Can you speak to the unique elements of the various schools\n\n16:16.000 --> 16:22.960\n of that Soviet Marxism? So we got Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, maybe even let's expand\n\n16:22.960 --> 16:32.240\n out to Maoism. So maybe I could speak to sort of Leninism, and then please tell me if I'm saying\n\n16:32.240 --> 16:41.840\n dumb things. I think for Lenin, there was an idea that there could be a small sort of vanguard party,\n\n16:41.840 --> 16:48.480\n like a small controlling entity that's like wise and is able to do the central planning decisions.\n\n16:49.040 --> 16:56.320\n Then for Stalinism, one interesting\u2014Stalin's implementation of all of this\u2014one interesting\n\n16:56.320 --> 17:02.720\n characteristic is to move away from the international aspect of the ideal of Marxism to\n\n17:02.720 --> 17:11.200\n make it all about nation, nationalism, the strength of nation. And then so Maoism is\n\n17:13.040 --> 17:19.920\n different in that it's focused on agriculture and rural. And then Trotskyism, I don't know\n\n17:20.640 --> 17:26.480\n except that it's anti Stalin. I mean, I don't even know if there's unique sort of philosophical\n\n17:26.480 --> 17:31.280\n elements there. Anyway, can you maybe from those or something else speak to different unique\n\n17:31.280 --> 17:37.920\n elements that are interesting to think about implementation of Marxism in the real world?\n\n17:37.920 --> 17:46.080\n Probably the best way to get into this is to describe something that happened in Marxism\n\n17:46.080 --> 17:53.120\n that then shapes the answer to your question. In the early days of Marx's writings,\n\n17:53.120 --> 18:00.880\n and you know, his life spans the 19th century. He's born in 1818, dies in 1883, so literally\n\n18:00.880 --> 18:08.720\n he lives the 19th century. And to make things simple, you might look at the first half of the\n\n18:08.720 --> 18:17.680\n first two thirds of his life as overwhelmingly gathering together the precursors to his own work.\n\n18:17.680 --> 18:24.160\n Marx was unusually scholarly in the sense that partly because he didn't work a regular job,\n\n18:24.160 --> 18:29.920\n and partly because he was an exile in London most of his adult life, he worked in the library. I\n\n18:29.920 --> 18:35.600\n mean, he had a lot of time. He got subsidized a little bit by Engels, whose family were\n\n18:35.600 --> 18:42.240\n manufacturers. And you might say the first half to two thirds of his life are about\n\n18:42.240 --> 18:51.520\n the critique of capitalism. And that was what, in a broad sense, the audience for his work,\n\n18:52.080 --> 18:58.560\n Western Europe more or less, was interested in. That's what they wanted. And he gave that to them.\n\n18:58.560 --> 19:06.720\n He wasn't the only one, but he was very, very effective at it. By the last third of his life,\n\n19:06.720 --> 19:17.040\n he and the other producers of an anti capitalist movement, people like the Chartists in England,\n\n19:17.040 --> 19:25.040\n that's a whole other movement, the anarchists of various kinds, like Proudhon in France,\n\n19:25.600 --> 19:32.800\n or Kropotkin or Bakunin in Russia, and so on. You pull all these together, and there was a shift\n\n19:32.800 --> 19:42.640\n in what the audience, let's call it a mixture of militant working class people on the one hand,\n\n19:43.200 --> 19:49.120\n and critical or radical intelligentsia on the other. They now wanted a different question.\n\n19:49.120 --> 19:56.560\n They were persuaded by the analysis. They were agreeable that capitalism was a phase they would\n\n19:56.560 --> 20:03.920\n like to do better than. And the question became, how do we do this? Not anymore, should we? Why\n\n20:03.920 --> 20:09.520\n should we? Could we maybe fix capitalism? No, they had gotten to the point, the system has\n\n20:09.520 --> 20:16.160\n to be fundamentally changed. But they didn't go, you might imagine, they didn't go and say, well,\n\n20:16.160 --> 20:21.520\n what will that new system looks like? They didn't go that way. What they did was ask the question,\n\n20:21.520 --> 20:31.120\n how could we get beyond capitalism? It seems so powerful. It seems to have captured people's minds,\n\n20:31.120 --> 20:39.360\n people's daily lives, and so on. And the focus of the conversation became, this was already\n\n20:39.360 --> 20:46.640\n by the last third of the 19th century, the question of the agency, the mechanism whereby\n\n20:46.640 --> 20:55.200\n we would get beyond. And again, make a long story short, the conversation focused on seizing the\n\n20:55.200 --> 21:03.360\n government. Before that, the government was not a major interest. If you read Marx's Capital,\n\n21:03.360 --> 21:09.440\n the great work of his maturity, three volumes, there's almost nothing in the state. He mentions\n\n21:09.440 --> 21:16.480\n it, but he's interested in the details of how capitalism works, factory by factory, store by\n\n21:16.480 --> 21:22.560\n store, office. What's the structure? The government's secondary for him. But there's also humans within\n\n21:22.560 --> 21:29.040\n that capitalist system of, there's the working class. That's what he's interested in. He's\n\n21:29.040 --> 21:34.960\n interested in each, think of it almost mechanically like the workplace. In the workplace there,\n\n21:34.960 --> 21:40.720\n some people who do this and other people who do that, and they accept this division of authority,\n\n21:40.720 --> 21:46.400\n and they accept this division of what's going on here, particularly because he believed that the\n\n21:46.400 --> 21:53.280\n core economic objective of capitalism was to maximize something called profit, which his\n\n21:53.280 --> 22:00.080\n analysis located right there in the workings of the enterprise. The government was not the\n\n22:00.080 --> 22:08.160\n the key factor here. And he was looking at ideas of value. How much value does\n\n22:08.160 --> 22:14.880\n the labor of the individual workers provide? And that means, how do we reward the workers in an\n\n22:14.880 --> 22:22.560\n ethical way? And so those are the questions. But the government is not part of that picture.\n\n22:23.200 --> 22:28.960\n So it's very significant that towards the end of the 19th century, Marx is still alive when this\n\n22:28.960 --> 22:38.320\n begins, but it really gets going after he dies, is this debate among Marxists about the role of\n\n22:38.320 --> 22:45.280\n the state. They all agreed, nearly all of them agree, that you have to get the state. The working\n\n22:45.280 --> 22:54.560\n class has to get the state because they see the state as the ultimate guarantor of capitalism.\n\n22:54.560 --> 23:01.600\n When things get really out of hand, the capitalist calls the police or he calls the army or both of\n\n23:01.600 --> 23:11.040\n them. And so the government is in a sense this key institution captured in Marxist language\n\n23:11.040 --> 23:18.160\n by the bourgeoisie, by the other side, the capitalists, and yet vulnerable because of\n\n23:18.160 --> 23:25.920\n suffrage. If suffrage is universal or nearly so, if everybody gets a vote, which in a way\n\n23:25.920 --> 23:32.640\n capitalism brings to bear, part of its rejection of feudalism in the French American Revolution\n\n23:32.640 --> 23:41.040\n is to create a place where elected represented. So the government being subject to suffrage\n\n23:41.040 --> 23:49.680\n creates the notion, aha, here's how we're gonna, we have to seize the state. And then that gets\n\n23:49.680 --> 23:56.160\n agreed upon, but there's a big split as to how to do it. One side says you go with the election,\n\n23:56.160 --> 24:04.480\n you mobilize the voter. That gets to be called reformism within Marxism. And the other side\n\n24:04.480 --> 24:12.480\n is revolution. Don't do that. This system, if I may quote Bernie again, is rigged. You can't\n\n24:12.480 --> 24:19.760\n get there. They've long ago learned how to manipulate parliaments. They buy the politicians\n\n24:19.760 --> 24:25.760\n and all that, and therefore revolution is going to be the way to do it. Revolution\n\n24:26.720 --> 24:32.400\n gets a very big boost because the Russians, they did it that way. They didn't do, I mean,\n\n24:32.400 --> 24:39.440\n they fought in the Duma, in the Parliament, but they didn't. And this focus on the state,\n\n24:39.440 --> 24:47.440\n I would argue, goes way beyond what the debaters at the time, and if you're interested in the great\n\n24:47.440 --> 24:55.280\n names, there was a great theorist of the role of the state in a reformist strategy to get power\n\n24:55.280 --> 25:04.480\n in Germany named Edward Bernstein. Very important. His opponents in Germany were Karl Kautsky and\n\n25:04.480 --> 25:11.760\n Rosa Luxemburg, the two other huge figures in Marxism at the time, and they wrote the articles\n\n25:11.760 --> 25:17.200\n that everybody reads, but it was a much broader debate. By the way, that debate still goes on.\n\n25:17.760 --> 25:19.200\n Reformism versus revolution?\n\n25:19.200 --> 25:24.800\n WOLFF Mhm. And in terms of not all that different. I mean, it's adjusted to history, but\n\n25:24.800 --> 25:26.000\n in terms of different.\n\n25:26.000 --> 25:30.640\n SIMON Can you comment on where you lean in terms of\n\n25:31.200 --> 25:34.720\n the mechanism of progress, reformation versus revolution?\n\n25:34.720 --> 25:36.480\n WOLFF I'd rather tell you the historical story.\n\n25:36.480 --> 25:36.980\n SIMON Sure.\n\n25:36.980 --> 25:40.000\n WOLFF Over and over and over again, in most cases,\n\n25:40.560 --> 25:46.560\n the reformists have always won because revolution is frightening, is scary, is dangerous,\n\n25:46.560 --> 25:52.000\n and so most of the time, when you get to the point where it's even a relevant discussion, not an\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:58.320\n abstract thing for conferences, but a real strategic issue, the reformists have won.\n\n25:58.320 --> 26:04.240\n I mean, and I'll give you an example from the United States. In the Great Depression of the\n\n26:04.240 --> 26:11.760\n 1930s, you had an extraordinary shift to the left in the United States, the greatest shift to the\n\n26:11.760 --> 26:17.360\n United States, the greatest shift to the left in the country's history before or since, nothing\n\n26:17.360 --> 26:28.000\n like it. Suddenly, you created a vast left wing composed of the labor movement, which went crazy\n\n26:28.000 --> 26:33.680\n in the 1930s. We organized more people into unions in the 1930s than at any time before\n\n26:33.680 --> 26:41.280\n or any time since. It is the explosion. And at the same time, the explosion of two socialist parties\n\n26:41.280 --> 26:48.160\n and the Communist Party that became very powerful, and they all worked together, creating a very\n\n26:48.160 --> 26:55.760\n powerful leftist presence in this country. They debated in a strategically real way reform or\n\n26:55.760 --> 27:02.560\n revolution. The reformers were the union people, by and large, and the communists were the\n\n27:02.560 --> 27:08.320\n revolutionaries, by and large, because they were affiliated with the Communist International,\n\n27:08.320 --> 27:13.280\n with Russia and all of that. And in between, you might say, the two socialist parties,\n\n27:13.280 --> 27:19.920\n one that was Trotskyist in inspiration and the other one more moderate Western European kind\n\n27:19.920 --> 27:26.320\n of socialism. And they had this intense debate. And they ended up, the reformists won that debate.\n\n27:26.320 --> 27:34.800\n There was no revolution in the 1930s here. But there was a reform that achieved unspeakably\n\n27:34.800 --> 27:40.480\n great successes, which is why it was as strong and remains as strong as it does, because\n\n27:40.480 --> 27:45.280\n it achieved in a few years, in the 1930s, starting around 1932,\n\n27:45.280 --> 27:50.480\n three social security in this country. We had never had that before. That's the same one we\n\n27:50.480 --> 27:57.440\n have now. Unemployment insurance never existed before that you have till today. Minimum wage\n\n27:57.440 --> 28:03.280\n for the first time, still have that today. And a federal program of employment that hired 15\n\n28:03.280 --> 28:09.440\n million people. I mean, these were unspeakable gifts, if you like, to the working class.\n\n28:09.440 --> 28:11.120\n So that's the 30s and the 40s.\n\n28:11.120 --> 28:18.560\n 30s. Not much in the 40s anymore, but in the 30s. And here's the best part. It was paid for by taxes\n\n28:18.560 --> 28:24.160\n on corporations and the rich. So when people today say, well, you can tax the government,\n\n28:24.160 --> 28:32.160\n the joke is I have to teach American history to Americans because it has been erased from\n\n28:32.160 --> 28:33.360\n consciousness.\n\n28:33.360 --> 28:38.480\n We'll return to that. But first, let's take a stroll back to the beginning of the 20th century\n\n28:38.480 --> 28:39.200\n with the Russians.\n\n28:39.200 --> 28:43.920\n With the Russians. So their interpretation goes like this.\n\n28:47.040 --> 28:52.640\n Everybody was right. The state is crucial. We were right. We were the revolutionaries.\n\n28:52.640 --> 28:59.440\n We seized the state here in Russia. Now we have the state. And socialism\n\n28:59.440 --> 29:06.480\n is when the working class captures the state, either by reform or revolution, and then uses\n\n29:06.480 --> 29:12.880\n its power over the state to make the transition from capitalism to the better thing we're\n\n29:12.880 --> 29:20.480\n going toward. And again, make a long story short, in the interest of time, what happens,\n\n29:20.480 --> 29:26.640\n which is not unusual in human history, is that the means becomes the end.\n\n29:26.640 --> 29:31.200\n In other words, Lenin, who's crystal clear before he died, you know, he doesn't live\n\n29:31.200 --> 29:38.240\n very long, he dies in 23. So he's only in power from 17 to 22. By that time, he has\n\n29:38.240 --> 29:39.120\n his brain trouble.\n\n29:39.120 --> 29:42.000\n 1923, by the way, not at age 23.\n\n29:42.000 --> 29:47.680\n Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1923. Yeah, he's only there for four or five years. He's very clear.\n\n29:48.240 --> 29:53.440\n He even says, I've done work on that, I've published, so I know this stuff. He says in\n\n29:53.440 --> 29:59.680\n a famous speech, let's not fool ourselves. We have captured the state, but we don't\n\n29:59.680 --> 30:04.320\n have socialism. We have to create that. We have to move towards that.\n\n30:06.880 --> 30:12.240\n With Stalin, you know, Lenin dies, and there's a fight between Stalin and Trotsky. Trotsky\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:18.000\n loses the fight, he's exiled, he goes to Mexico. Stalin is now alone in power, does\n\n30:18.000 --> 30:27.120\n all the things he's famous or infamous for. And by the end of the 20s, Stalin makes a\n\n30:27.120 --> 30:32.560\n decision. I mean, not that he makes it alone, but things have evolved in Russia so that\n\n30:32.560 --> 30:41.840\n they do the following. They declare that they are socialism. In other words, socialism becomes\n\n30:41.840 --> 30:49.600\n when you capture the state. Not when the state capture has enabled you to do X, Y, Z, other\n\n30:49.600 --> 30:57.600\n things. No, no. The state itself, once you have it, is socialism. So when a socialist\n\n30:57.600 --> 31:04.960\n captures the state, that's socialism. Exactly. That's exactly right. I feel like that's\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:10.160\n definitionally confusing. Well, it shouldn't be, because I'll give you an example. If\n\n31:10.160 --> 31:15.520\n you go to many parts of the United States today, and you ask people, what's socialism?\n\n31:16.160 --> 31:23.360\n They'll look you right in the face and they'll say, the post office. When I first heard this\n\n31:23.360 --> 31:30.080\n as a young man, I go, what? The post office. It took me a while to understand. The post\n\n31:30.080 --> 31:36.960\n office, Amtrak, the Tennessee, all the examples in the United States where the government\n\n31:36.960 --> 31:45.840\n runs something. This is socialism. See, capitalism is if the government doesn't run it. If a\n\n31:45.840 --> 31:52.000\n private individual who's not a government official runs it, well, then it's capitalism.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:58.880\n If the government takes it, then it's socialism. So what is wrong with that reasoning? So the\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:04.160\n idea, I think... There's nothing wrong with it's a way of looking at the world. It's just\n\n32:04.160 --> 32:09.280\n got nothing to do with Marx. Well, there's Marx, there's Marxism. Let's try to pull\n\n32:09.280 --> 32:22.320\n this apart. So what role does central planning have in Marxism? So Marxism is concerned with\n\n32:22.320 --> 32:31.760\n this class struggle, with respecting the working class. What is the connection between that\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:36.800\n struggle and central planning that is often... Central planning is often associated with\n\n32:36.800 --> 32:44.000\n Marxism. Right. So a centralized power doing... Russia did that. Allocation. So that has to\n\n32:44.000 --> 32:49.600\n do with a very specific set of implementations initiated by the Soviet Union. Has nothing\n\n32:49.600 --> 32:54.960\n to do with Marx. How else can you do... I don't think you can find anywhere in Marx's\n\n32:54.960 --> 33:00.880\n writing anything about central planning or any other kind of planning. Again, fundamentally\n\n33:00.880 --> 33:14.480\n then, Marx's work, it has to do with factories, with workers, with the bourgeoisie, and the\n\n33:14.480 --> 33:20.080\n exploitation of the working class. Exactly. You still have to take that leap. What is\n\n33:20.080 --> 33:28.000\n beyond capitalism? Right. So maybe we should turn to that, focus on that. Yes. Okay. We've\n\n33:28.000 --> 33:34.240\n already looked historically at several attempts to go beyond capitalism. How else can we go\n\n33:34.240 --> 33:40.000\n beyond capitalism? Right. Let me push a little further. They didn't succeed in my judgment\n\n33:40.000 --> 33:46.880\n as a Marxist. And I'm now gonna tell you why they didn't succeed, because they didn't understand\n\n33:46.880 --> 33:52.160\n as well as they could have or should have what Marxist was trying to do. I think I would\n\n33:52.160 --> 33:55.360\n have been like them if I had lived at their time under their circumstances. This is not\n\n33:55.360 --> 34:01.120\n a critique of them, but it's a different way of understanding what's going on. All right.\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:09.840\n So give you an example. Most of my adult life I have taught Marxian economics. I'm a professor\n\n34:09.840 --> 34:16.720\n of economics. I've been that all my life. I'm a graduate of American universities. As\n\n34:16.720 --> 34:22.640\n it happens, I'm a graduate of what in this country passes for its best universities.\n\n34:22.640 --> 34:29.440\n That's another conversation you and I can have. So I went to Harvard, then I went to\n\n34:29.440 --> 34:35.600\n Stanford, and I finished at Yale. I'm like a poster boy for elite education. They tried\n\n34:35.600 --> 34:42.160\n very hard. By the way, I spent 10 years of my life in the Ivy League, 20 semesters, one\n\n34:42.160 --> 34:51.280\n after the other, no break. In those 20 semesters, 19 of them never mentioned a word about Marxism\n\n34:51.280 --> 34:59.200\n that is no critique of capitalism was offered to me ever with one except one professor in\n\n34:59.200 --> 35:05.360\n Stanford in the one semester I studied with him, he gave me plenty to read, but nobody\n\n35:05.360 --> 35:09.520\n else. So that's really interesting. You've mentioned that in the past, and that's very\n\n35:09.520 --> 35:18.560\n true, which makes you a very interesting figure to hold your ground intellectually through\n\n35:18.560 --> 35:25.600\n this idea space where just people don't really even talk about it. Perhaps we can discuss\n\n35:25.600 --> 35:31.360\n historically why that is, but nevertheless, that's the case. So Marxian economics, did\n\n35:31.360 --> 35:35.040\n Karl Marx come up in conversation as a kind of...\n\n35:36.080 --> 35:42.160\n Dismissal. The best example, yeah, he came up only as an object of dismissal. To give\n\n35:42.160 --> 35:48.000\n you an example, the major textbook in economics that I was taught with, and that was for many\n\n35:48.000 --> 35:54.800\n years the canonical book, it isn't quite anymore, was a book authored by a professor of economics\n\n35:54.800 --> 36:03.200\n at MIT named Paul Samuelson, and a whole generation or two were trained on his textbook.\n\n36:03.200 --> 36:10.480\n If you open the cover of his textbook, he has a tree, and the tree is Adam Smith and\n\n36:10.480 --> 36:16.240\n David Ricardo at the root, and then the different branches of it. He's trying to give you an\n\n36:16.240 --> 36:22.480\n idea as a student of how the thing developed. And it's a tree, and everybody on it is a\n\n36:22.480 --> 36:27.760\n bourgeois. And then there's this one little branch that goes off like this and sort of\n\n36:27.760 --> 36:33.040\n starts heading back down. That's Karl Marx. In other words, he had to have it complete\n\n36:33.040 --> 36:38.720\n because he's not a complete faker, but beyond that, no, there was no. Nothing in the book\n\n36:38.720 --> 36:47.520\n gives you two paragraphs of an approach. But that's Cold War. I mean, that's really neither\n\n36:47.520 --> 36:52.080\n here. That's the craziness. Yeah, that's the Cold War in this country. My professors\n\n36:52.080 --> 36:59.280\n were afraid. Anyway, let me get to the core of it, what I think will help. Marx was interested\n\n36:59.280 --> 37:05.680\n in the relationship of people in the process of production. He's interested in the factory,\n\n37:05.680 --> 37:12.800\n the office, the store, what goes on, and by that he means what are the relationships among\n\n37:12.800 --> 37:22.320\n the people that come together in a workplace. And what he analyzes is that there is something\n\n37:22.320 --> 37:31.760\n going on there that has not been adequately understood and that has not been adequately\n\n37:31.760 --> 37:40.560\n addressed as an object needing transformation. And what does he mean? The answer is exploitation,\n\n37:40.560 --> 37:48.080\n which he defines mathematically in the following way. Whenever in a society, any society,\n\n37:48.800 --> 37:54.960\n you organize people, adults, not the children, not the sick, but, you know, healthy adults,\n\n37:54.960 --> 38:03.120\n in the following way, a big block of them, a clear majority, work. That is, they use their\n\n38:03.120 --> 38:09.920\n brains and their muscles to transform nature. A tree into a chair, a sheep into a woolen sweater,\n\n38:09.920 --> 38:16.400\n whatever. In every human community, Marx argues, there are the people who do that work,\n\n38:16.400 --> 38:25.120\n but they always produce more chairs, more sweaters, more hamburgers than they themselves consume,\n\n38:25.120 --> 38:29.680\n whatever their standard of living. Doesn't have to be low, can be medium, can be high,\n\n38:29.680 --> 38:38.200\n but they always produce more than they themselves consume. That more, by the way, Marx, when he\n\n38:38.200 --> 38:44.960\n writes this, uses the German word mehr, m e h r, which is the English equivalent of more. It's the\n\n38:44.960 --> 38:54.720\n more. That more got badly translated into the word surplus. Shouldn't have been, but it was. By the\n\n38:54.720 --> 38:59.360\n way, by German and English people doing the translations. What's the difference between\n\n38:59.360 --> 39:06.080\n more and surplus? Is there a nuanced? Yeah, because surplus has a notion of its discretionary,\n\n39:06.080 --> 39:12.480\n it's sort of extra. He's not making a judgment that it's extra. It's a simple math equation.\n\n39:12.480 --> 39:20.400\n Yes, very simple. One minus the other. Yes, x minus y. That's right. x is the total output,\n\n39:20.400 --> 39:29.200\n y is the consumption by the producer, therefore x minus y equals s, the surplus. Exactly. Now, Marx\n\n39:29.200 --> 39:38.400\n argues, the minute you understand this, you will ask the following question. Who gets the surplus?\n\n39:38.400 --> 39:47.560\n Who gets this extra stuff that is made but not consumed by those who made it? And Marx's answer\n\n39:47.560 --> 39:54.800\n is, therein lies one of the great shapers of any society. How is that organized? For example,\n\n39:54.800 --> 40:03.440\n who gets it? What are they asked, if anything, to do with it in exchange for getting it? What's\n\n40:03.440 --> 40:08.960\n their social role? For example, here we go now, if you get this and you get the core of it anyway,\n\n40:10.640 --> 40:20.480\n and I don't charge much, the workers themselves could get it. The workers themselves could get\n\n40:20.480 --> 40:28.960\n it. That's the closest Marx comes to a definition of communism. Communism would be if the workers\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:38.160\n who produce the surplus together decide what to do with it. So this has to do not just with who gets\n\n40:38.160 --> 40:43.840\n it, but more importantly, who gets to decide who gets it. Well, who gets it and who gets to decide\n\n40:43.840 --> 40:49.440\n what to do with it. Right. Because you can't decide it if you don't have disposition over it.\n\n40:49.440 --> 40:57.920\n So this is the logic of the word sequence. It's produced. Marx uses the word appropriated. In\n\n40:57.920 --> 41:04.400\n other words, whose property, who gets to decide, if you like, what happens. All that property ever\n\n41:04.400 --> 41:10.160\n meant is who gets to decide and who's excluded. That's a clean definition of communism.\n\n41:10.160 --> 41:14.880\n Right. By the way, it's not just clean. This is the only one.\n\n41:14.880 --> 41:19.360\n So can we just linger on the definition of exploitation in that context?\n\n41:20.080 --> 41:27.600\n Easy. It becomes very easy. Exploitation exists if and when the surplus that's produced\n\n41:27.600 --> 41:34.480\n is taken and distributed by people other than those who produced it. Slaves produce a surplus\n\n41:34.480 --> 41:42.000\n which the master gets. Serfs produce a surplus which the lord gets. Employees produce a surplus\n\n41:42.000 --> 41:52.000\n which the employer gets. It's very simple. These are exploitative class structures because one\n\n41:52.000 --> 42:01.920\n class produces a surplus appropriated, distributed by another group of people, not the ones who\n\n42:01.920 --> 42:10.320\n produced it, which creates hostility, enmity, envy, anger, resentment, and all of the problems\n\n42:10.320 --> 42:18.240\n you can lump under the heading class struggle. I use a metaphor, simple metaphorical story.\n\n42:18.240 --> 42:23.440\n You have two children, let's assume, and you take them to Central Park a few blocks from here.\n\n42:23.440 --> 42:29.440\n It's a nice day and the children are playing and in comes one of those men with an ice cream truck\n\n42:29.440 --> 42:35.600\n comes by. Dingalingalingaling, your children see the ice cream. Daddy, get me an ice cream. So you\n\n42:35.600 --> 42:41.520\n walk over, you take some money, and you get two ice cream cones and you give them to one of the\n\n42:41.520 --> 42:49.040\n children. The other one begins to scream and yell and howl, obviously. What's the issue? And you\n\n42:49.040 --> 42:55.520\n realize you've just made a terrible mistake. So you order the one you gave the two ice cream cones\n\n42:55.520 --> 43:01.440\n to give one of those to your sister or your brother or whatever it is. And that's how you\n\n43:01.440 --> 43:08.480\n solve the problem. Until a psychologist comes along and says, you know, you didn't fix it by\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:16.160\n what you just did. You should never have done that in the first place. My response, so you understand,\n\n43:17.040 --> 43:24.400\n all of the efforts to deal with inequality in economic, political culture, these are all\n\n43:25.520 --> 43:30.560\n giving the ice cream cone back to the kid. You should never do this in the first place.\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:34.080\n LW. The reallocation of resources creates bitterness in the populace.\n\n43:34.080 --> 43:39.920\n RL. Look at Arva. This country is tearing itself apart now in a way that I have never seen in my\n\n43:39.920 --> 43:45.360\n life, and I've lived here all my life, and I've worked here all my life. It's tearing itself\n\n43:45.360 --> 43:53.520\n apart, and it's tearing itself apart basically over the redivision, the redistribution of wealth,\n\n43:53.520 --> 43:59.840\n having so badly distributed in the first place. But that's all in Marx. And notice as I explain\n\n43:59.840 --> 44:06.000\n to you what is going on in this tension filled production scene in the office, the factory,\n\n44:06.000 --> 44:10.640\n the store. I don't have to say a word about the government. I'm not interested in the government.\n\n44:10.640 --> 44:17.280\n The government's really a very secondary matter to this core question. And here comes the big point.\n\n44:18.400 --> 44:25.520\n If you make a revolution and all you do is remove the private exploiter\n\n44:25.520 --> 44:30.880\n and substitute a government official without changing the relationship,\n\n44:32.640 --> 44:36.560\n you can call yourself a Marxist all day long, but you're not getting the point\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:43.360\n of the Marxism. The point was not who the exploiter is, but the exploitation per se.\n\n44:43.360 --> 44:49.040\n You've got to change the organization of the workplace so there isn't a group that makes all\n\n44:49.040 --> 44:55.120\n the decisions and gets the surplus vis a vis another one that produces it. If you do that,\n\n44:55.120 --> 45:01.760\n you will destroy the whole project. Not only will you not achieve what you set out to get,\n\n45:01.760 --> 45:06.880\n but you'll so misunderstand it that the Germans again have a phrase,\n\n45:06.880 --> 45:12.960\n es geht schief. It goes crooked. It doesn't go right. The project gets off the rails because\n\n45:14.800 --> 45:19.600\n it can't understand either what its objective should have been, and therefore it doesn't\n\n45:19.600 --> 45:25.760\n understand how and why it's missing its objective. It just knows that this is not what it had hoped\n\n45:25.760 --> 45:33.520\n for. I mean there's a lot of fascinating questions here. So one is to what degree,\n\n45:33.520 --> 45:42.160\n so there's human nature, to what degree does communism, a lack of exploitation of the working\n\n45:42.160 --> 45:48.960\n class naturally emerge? If you leave two people together in a room and come back a year later,\n\n45:48.960 --> 45:53.840\n if you leave five people together in a room, if you leave a hundred people and a thousand people,\n\n45:54.480 --> 46:01.600\n it seems that humans form hierarchies naturally. So the clever, the charismatic,\n\n46:02.560 --> 46:11.360\n the sexy, the muscular, the powerful, however you define that, starts becoming a leader and start to\n\n46:11.360 --> 46:20.320\n do maybe exploitation in a nonnegative sense, a more generic sense, starts to become an employer,\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:25.520\n not in a capitalist sense, but just as a human. Here, you go do this, and in exchange I will give\n\n46:25.520 --> 46:32.080\n you this. Just becomes the leadership role, right? So the question is, yes, okay, it would be nice,\n\n46:33.200 --> 46:37.680\n the idea sort of of communism would be nice to not steal from the world.\n\n46:37.680 --> 46:41.680\n Nice in theory, but it doesn't work in practice because of human nature.\n\n46:41.680 --> 46:48.320\n Because of human nature. That's, thank you. So what can we say about leveraging human nature\n\n46:48.320 --> 46:52.240\n to achieve some of these ends? There's so many ways of responding,\n\n46:53.280 --> 47:01.600\n in no particular order. Here are some of them. The history of the human race, as best I can tell,\n\n47:01.600 --> 47:11.040\n is a history in which a succession of social forms, forms of society, arise,\n\n47:13.360 --> 47:22.160\n and as they do, they rule out some kinds of human behavior on the grounds that they are socially\n\n47:22.160 --> 47:30.160\n disruptive and unacceptable. The argument isn't really then, is there a need or an instinct,\n\n47:30.160 --> 47:36.560\n is there some human nature that makes people want to do this? Well, whatever that is,\n\n47:36.560 --> 47:42.800\n this has to be repressed or else we don't have a society. And Freud helps us to understand\n\n47:43.520 --> 47:49.920\n that that repression is going on all the time and it has consequences. It's not a finished project,\n\n47:49.920 --> 47:56.160\n you repress it, it's gone, it doesn't work like that. So for example, when you get a bunch of\n\n47:56.160 --> 48:02.880\n people together at some point, they may develop animosities towards one another that lead them to\n\n48:02.880 --> 48:10.480\n want the other person or persons to disappear, to be dead, to be gone. But we don't permit you to\n\n48:11.040 --> 48:21.600\n do that. We just don't. Every economic system that has ever existed has included people who defend it\n\n48:21.600 --> 48:29.920\n on the grounds that it is the only system consistent with human nature and that every\n\n48:29.920 --> 48:37.040\n effort to go beyond it has to fail because it contradicts human nature. I can show you\n\n48:37.040 --> 48:44.160\n endless documents of every tribal society I've ever studied, every anthropological community that\n\n48:44.160 --> 48:50.400\n has ever been studied, slavery wherever it's existed. I can show you endless documents in\n\n48:50.400 --> 48:56.800\n which the defenders of those systems, not all of them of course, but many defenders used that\n\n48:56.800 --> 49:03.520\n argument. To naturalize a system is a way to hold on to it, to prevent it from going,\n\n49:04.400 --> 49:11.440\n to counter the argument that every system is born, every system evolves, and then every system dies.\n\n49:12.240 --> 49:19.360\n And therefore capitalism, since it was born and since it's been developing, we all know what the\n\n49:19.360 --> 49:26.800\n next stage of capitalism is. The burden is on the people who think it isn't going to die.\n\n49:26.800 --> 49:31.200\n Okay, so it doesn't mean they're wrong, but what you're saying is if we look at history,\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:36.720\n you're deeply suspicious of the argument this is going against human nature because we keep\n\n49:36.720 --> 49:42.160\n using that for basically everything including toxic relationship, toxic systems, destructive\n\n49:42.160 --> 49:50.080\n systems. That said, well, let me just ask a million different questions. So one, what about\n\n49:50.080 --> 50:01.120\n the argument that sort of the employer, the capitalist takes on risk versus the employee\n\n50:01.120 --> 50:10.000\n who's just there doing the labor? The capitalist is actually putting up a lot of risk. Are they not\n\n50:10.000 --> 50:14.400\n in sort of aggregating this organization and taking this giant effort, hiring a lot of people?\n\n50:15.040 --> 50:20.480\n Aren't they taking on risk that this is going to be a giant failure? So first of all, there's risk\n\n50:22.000 --> 50:28.400\n almost in everything you undertake. Any project that begins now and ends in the future takes a\n\n50:28.400 --> 50:34.880\n risk that between now and that future something's going to happen that makes it not work out. I mean,\n\n50:34.880 --> 50:42.080\n I got into a cab before I came here today. In order to do this with you, I took a risk. The cab\n\n50:42.080 --> 50:46.400\n could have been in an accident. The lightning could have hit us. A bear could have eaten my\n\n50:46.400 --> 50:51.200\n left foot. Who the hell knows? But shouldn't I reward you for the risk you took? No, hold it\n\n50:51.200 --> 50:57.040\n a second. Let's do this step by step. So everybody's taking a risk. I always found it wonderful.\n\n50:57.040 --> 51:03.040\n You talk about risk and then you imagine it's only some of us who take a risk. Let's go with\n\n51:03.040 --> 51:12.160\n the worker, with the capitalist. That worker, he moved his family from Michigan to Pennsylvania to\n\n51:12.160 --> 51:20.400\n take that job. He made a decision to have children. They are teenagers. They're now in school at a\n\n51:20.400 --> 51:25.440\n time when their friendships are crucial to their development. You're going to yank them out of the\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:35.200\n school because his job is gone. He took an enormous risk to do that job every day, to forestall all\n\n51:35.200 --> 51:41.920\n the other things he could have done. He was taking a risk that this job would be here tomorrow, next\n\n51:41.920 --> 51:48.720\n month, next year. He bought a house, which Americans only do with mortgages, which means he's\n\n51:48.720 --> 51:57.120\n now stuck. He has to make a monthly payment. If you make a mistake, you capitalist. He's the one\n\n51:57.120 --> 52:00.480\n who's going to, you're a capitalist. You got a lot of money. Otherwise, you wouldn't be in that\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:08.400\n position. You've got a cushion. He doesn't. If you investigate, you'll see that in every business\n\n52:08.400 --> 52:11.920\n I've ever been in. I've been involved in a lot of them. So you think it's possible to actually\n\n52:11.920 --> 52:17.360\n measure risk or is your basic argument is there's risk involved in a lot of both the working class\n\n52:17.360 --> 52:23.040\n and the bourgeoisie, the capitalists. That's right. And the worker would never come and say,\n\n52:23.760 --> 52:31.680\n because he's been taught right, I want this payment, a wage for the work I do.\n\n52:32.560 --> 52:39.200\n And I want this page, this payment for the risk I take. Well, there's some level of communication\n\n52:39.200 --> 52:44.640\n like that. You have acknowledgement of dangerous jobs, but that's probably built into the salary,\n\n52:44.640 --> 52:49.840\n all those kinds of things. But you're not incorporating the full spectrum of risk.\n\n52:50.720 --> 52:57.680\n You don't believe that. This country is now being literally transformed from below by an army of\n\n52:57.680 --> 53:04.800\n workers who work at Amazon, fast food joints. You know what their complaint is? It's killing us.\n\n53:05.760 --> 53:13.520\n We get paid shit and it's killing us. There is no relationship except in the minds of the defenders\n\n53:13.520 --> 53:21.120\n of capitalism between the ugliness, the difficulty, the danger of labor on the one hand and the wage.\n\n53:21.120 --> 53:25.840\n Let me give you just a couple of examples. This is my job. This is my life, what I do.\n\n53:26.880 --> 53:33.520\n The median income of a child care worker in the United States right now, as we speak,\n\n53:33.520 --> 53:45.520\n is $11.22 an hour median. So 50% make less, 50% make more. The median income for car park attendant\n\n53:46.480 --> 53:53.440\n is several dollars per hour higher than that. What does the car park attendant do? He stares at your\n\n53:53.440 --> 54:02.080\n car for many hours to make sure that nobody comes and grabs it. Maybe he parks it and he moves it\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:08.800\n and he moves it around to get it in and out. By any measure that I know of that makes any rational\n\n54:08.800 --> 54:16.320\n sense, being in charge of toddlers, two, three, four year olds who are at the key moment of\n\n54:16.320 --> 54:23.200\n mental formation the first five years, to give that a lower salary than you give the guy who\n\n54:23.200 --> 54:31.120\n watches your car. Come on, I know how to explain it. Gender explains all kinds of issues that the\n\n54:31.120 --> 54:37.360\n car park people are males and the day the child care people are females. And that in our culture\n\n54:37.360 --> 54:44.560\n is a very big marker of what, but the one who said only the economics professor, nobody else\n\n54:45.600 --> 54:50.160\n says this stuff because in economics, I don't know if you were familiar with our profession, but\n\n54:50.160 --> 54:58.320\n we have something which we call marginal product. This is a fantasy. I was a mathematician. Before\n\n54:58.320 --> 55:05.040\n I became an economist, I loved mathematics. I specialized in mathematics. So I know mathematics\n\n55:05.040 --> 55:11.120\n pretty well. What economists do is silly, is childish, but they think it's mathematics.\n\n55:13.840 --> 55:22.480\n But think for a minute what it means to suggest that you can identify the marginal product\n\n55:22.480 --> 55:29.680\n of a factor of production, like a worker. In the textbook when it's taught, I've taught this stuff.\n\n55:30.240 --> 55:35.040\n I hold my nose, but I teach it. Then I explain to students what I've just taught you is\n\n55:35.040 --> 55:39.360\n horse shit, but first I teach it. What is the marginal product if it might be useful?\n\n55:39.360 --> 55:46.320\n The notion is if you take away one worker right now from the pile, what will be the diminution\n\n55:46.320 --> 55:53.840\n of the output? That's the marginal product of that worker measured by the amount of the output\n\n55:54.240 --> 56:01.280\n that diminishes output of the raw product of the product. Usually in real terms or physical,\n\n56:01.280 --> 56:05.360\n not the value. You could do a value, but it's really more the physical you're at.\n\n56:05.360 --> 56:11.840\n I mean, there is a transformation thing. I'd love to talk to you about value. It's so interesting.\n\n56:11.840 --> 56:16.800\n What is value? I'd be glad to talk to you about value and price and all of that,\n\n56:16.800 --> 56:23.040\n but I just want to get to this. Hegel, who was Marx's teacher, has a famous line.\n\n56:23.680 --> 56:30.400\n You can't step in the same river twice. The argument is you and the river have changed\n\n56:30.400 --> 56:34.560\n between the first and the second time. It's a different you and it's a different river.\n\n56:34.560 --> 56:39.440\n You can choose not to pay attention to that. You can't claim you're not doing that.\n\n56:39.440 --> 56:44.960\n You can't claim that you can actually do that because you can't. There is no way to do that.\n\n56:44.960 --> 56:49.840\n So the meaning that you can't just remove a worker and have a clean\n\n56:49.840 --> 56:52.480\n mathematical calculation of the effect that it has on the output.\n\n56:52.480 --> 56:57.200\n That's right, because too many other things are going on, too many things are changing,\n\n56:57.200 --> 57:05.600\n and you cannot assume, much as you want to, that the outcome on the output side is uniquely\n\n57:05.600 --> 57:10.160\n determined by the change you made on the input side. You can't do that.\n\n57:10.160 --> 57:14.000\n Even in the average, it's not going to work out.\n\n57:14.000 --> 57:20.640\n You can take, look, mathematics is full of abstractions. You can say, as we do in economics,\n\n57:20.640 --> 57:27.360\n keteris paribus, everything else held constant, but you have to know what you just did. You know\n\n57:27.360 --> 57:31.840\n why you do that? Because you can't do that in the real world. That's not possible. You better\n\n57:31.840 --> 57:39.280\n account for that, otherwise you're mistaking the abstraction from the messy reality you abstracted\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:46.240\n from to get the abstraction. As a quick tangent, if we somehow went through a thought experiment\n\n57:46.240 --> 57:51.360\n or an actual experiment of removing every single economist from the world, would we be better off\n\n57:51.360 --> 57:57.920\n or worse off? Much better off. Okay. Economics, and I'm one, you know, I'm talking about myself.\n\n57:57.920 --> 58:03.920\n We're going to ship all the economists to Mars and see how well it works off.\n\n58:03.920 --> 58:12.640\n The serious part of this is that economics, it's really about capitalism. Economics as a\n\n58:12.640 --> 58:18.080\n discipline is born with capital. There was no such thing. I teach courses at the university,\n\n58:18.080 --> 58:24.480\n for example, called History of Economic Thought. I begin the students with Aristotle and Plato.\n\n58:24.480 --> 58:30.000\n And I say, you know, they talked about really interesting things, but they never called it\n\n58:30.000 --> 58:40.400\n economics. It made no sense to people to abstract something as central to daily life as economics\n\n58:40.400 --> 58:46.400\n broadly defined. It made no sense. That's a creation much, much later. That's capitalism\n\n58:46.400 --> 58:52.000\n that did that, created the field. So when I give them Plato and Aristotle, I have to give them\n\n58:52.000 --> 58:58.960\n particular passages. By the way, footnote, because your audience will like it. Plato and Aristotle\n\n58:58.960 --> 59:04.880\n talked about markets because they lived at a time in ancient Greece when market relations were\n\n59:04.880 --> 59:12.720\n beginning to intrude upon these societies. So they were both interested in this phenomena,\n\n59:12.720 --> 59:18.160\n that we're not just producing goods and then distributing among us. We're doing it in a quid\n\n59:18.160 --> 59:22.720\n pro quo. You know, I'll give you three oranges, you give me two shirts, a market exchange.\n\n59:23.440 --> 59:29.360\n And both Aristotle and Plato hated markets, denounced them, and for the same reason,\n\n59:29.920 --> 59:36.240\n they destroy social cohesion. They destroy community. They make some people rich and\n\n59:36.240 --> 59:41.360\n other people poor, and they set us against each other, and it's terrible. And here's what\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:46.720\n that they agreed on that. Here's what they disagreed on. One of them said, okay, there\n\n59:46.720 --> 59:53.920\n can be no markets. That was Plato. Aristotle comes back and says, no, no, no, no, no, too late for\n\n59:53.920 --> 1:00:00.800\n that. The disruption caused in society by getting rid of this institution that has crawled in\n\n1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:09.760\n amongst us would be too devastating. So we can't do that. But what we can do is control it, regulate\n\n1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:16.880\n it, get from the market what it does reasonably well, and prevent it from doing the destructive\n\n1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:23.680\n things it does so badly. So the fundamentally the destructive thing of a market is it's the\n\n1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:32.960\n engine of capitalism, so it creates exploitation of the worker. It facilitates it, and it is an\n\n1:00:32.960 --> 1:00:40.880\n institution that Plato and Aristotle feel is a terrible danger to community. Which, by the way,\n\n1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:44.640\n is a way of thinking about it that exists right now all over the world.\n\n1:00:45.360 --> 1:00:50.800\n Look, the medieval Catholic Church had a doctrine, the prohibition of usury.\n\n1:00:53.280 --> 1:00:59.360\n You know, and this was that God said, if there's a person who needs to borrow from you,\n\n1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:07.360\n then that's a person in need. And the good Christian thing to do is to help him. To demand\n\n1:01:07.360 --> 1:01:15.440\n an interest payment rather than to help your fellow man is, God hates you for that. That's a sin.\n\n1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.680\n Jesus is crying all the way to wherever it is he goes.\n\n1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:26.080\n But would Jesus be crying when you try to scale that system? So that has to do with the\n\n1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:31.440\n with the intimate human interaction. The idea of markets is you're able\n\n1:01:33.360 --> 1:01:40.080\n to create a system that involves thousands, millions of humans, and there'd be some level of\n\n1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:45.760\n safe, self regulating fairness.\n\n1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:52.160\n There might be, but it's hard to imagine that charging interest would be the way to do that.\n\n1:01:52.160 --> 1:01:53.840\n I wonder what, so I guess...\n\n1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:59.120\n Suppose you were interested in having, suppose you took us your problem.\n\n1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:02.480\n We have a set of funds that can be loaned out.\n\n1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:11.040\n People don't want to consume it. They're ready to lend it. Okay. To whom should they lend it?\n\n1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:16.480\n Well, we could say in our society, we're going to run this the way professors\n\n1:02:16.480 --> 1:02:24.080\n in institutions like MIT work this. They write up a project. They send the project into some\n\n1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:31.360\n government office where it is looked at against other projects. And this office in the government\n\n1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:38.400\n decides we're going to fund this one and that one because they're more needed in our society.\n\n1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:43.760\n We're in greater need of solving this problem than that problem. And so we're going to lend\n\n1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:49.280\n money to people working on this problem more readily or more money than we lend over here,\n\n1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:54.320\n because we're going to, but instead what we do is, who can pay the highest interest rate?\n\n1:02:55.440 --> 1:03:02.800\n Whoa, what are you doing? What ethics would justify you doing? It's like a market in general.\n\n1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:08.080\n Something is in shortage. All markets are about how to handle shortage. That's one\n\n1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:14.480\n basic way to understand it. And so if the demand is greater than the supply, which is all the word\n\n1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:20.480\n shortage means, has no other meaning, if the demand is greater than the supply, okay, now you've got\n\n1:03:20.480 --> 1:03:27.600\n a problem. You can't satisfy all the demanders because you don't have enough supply. You have\n\n1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:32.960\n a shortage. Okay, now how are you going to do it? In a market, you allow people who have a lot of\n\n1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:40.480\n money to bid up the price of whatever's short, and that solves your problem because as the price goes\n\n1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:47.120\n up, the poor people, they drop out. They can't buy the thing at the exalted price, so you've got a\n\n1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:53.680\n way of distributing the shortage. It goes to the people with the most money. At this point, most\n\n1:03:53.680 --> 1:04:00.080\n human beings confronted with this explanation of a market would turn against it because it\n\n1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:07.600\n contradicts their Christian, Judaic, Islamic, all of them would say, what? You know what that means?\n\n1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:13.440\n It means that a rich person can get the scarce milk and give it to their cat, while the poor\n\n1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:19.440\n person has no milk for their five children. There it is. You want a market? Why?\n\n1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:25.760\n The fundamental thing that seems unfair, there's the resulting inequality. Now...\n\n1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:26.800\n Or death.\n\n1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.560\n Or death. Well, that's the ultimate inequality.\n\n1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:31.200\n Yes, it is.\n\n1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:36.480\n What about, and we're going to jump around from the philosophical, from the economics,\n\n1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:44.800\n to the sort of debate type of thing. What about sort of the lifting ties raise all boats?\n\n1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:53.360\n Meaning, if we look at the 20th century, a lot of people, maybe you disagree with this,\n\n1:04:53.360 --> 1:04:59.680\n but they attribute a lot of the innovation and the average improvement in the quality of life\n\n1:05:01.360 --> 1:05:07.840\n to capitalism, to inventions and innovation, to engineering and science developments\n\n1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:17.360\n that resulted from competition and all those kinds of forces. So, not looking at the individual\n\n1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:24.800\n unfairness of exploitation as it's specifically defined, but just observing historically.\n\n1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:28.880\n Looking at the 20th century, we came up with a lot of cool stuff that seemed to have made life\n\n1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:34.240\n easier and better on average. What do you say to that?\n\n1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:42.880\n I have several responses to that, but I do disagree pretty fundamentally with what's\n\n1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:47.600\n going on there. But let me give you the arguments so that you can hear them,\n\n1:05:47.600 --> 1:05:52.560\n and then you can evaluate them, as can anybody who's listening or watching.\n\n1:05:56.160 --> 1:06:01.600\n Marx was a student of Hegel, and one of Hegel's central arguments was that everything that\n\n1:06:01.600 --> 1:06:09.760\n exists exists, quote, in contradiction. In simple English, there's a good and bad side,\n\n1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:15.040\n if you like, to everything. And you won't understand it unless you accept that proposition\n\n1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:20.160\n and start looking for the good things that are the other side of the bad ones, and the bad things\n\n1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:26.320\n that are the other side of the good ones, etc. So, the dialectic. Yes, exactly. And Marx,\n\n1:06:26.320 --> 1:06:33.200\n very attentive to that, explicitly agrees with this on many occasions, and applies it,\n\n1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:41.040\n of course, to the central object of his research, capitalism. So, this is not a simple minded fellow\n\n1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:45.840\n who's telling you all the bad things about capitalism as if there were nothing that this\n\n1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:53.760\n system achieved or accomplished. And one of the things he celebrates a lot is the technological\n\n1:06:53.760 --> 1:07:00.800\n dynamism of the system, which Marx takes to be profound, because, you know, he lived at the time\n\n1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:08.800\n when major breakthroughs in textile technology and mining and chemistry and so on were achieved.\n\n1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:18.080\n But as to the notion that capitalism is therefore responsible for the improvement in\n\n1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:23.920\n the quality or the standard of living of the mass of people, Marx now comes back and says,\n\n1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:35.600\n oh wait, wait a minute here. Number one, capitalism as a system has been mostly represented by\n\n1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:43.440\n capitalists, which makes a certain sense. And those capitalists, with very few exceptions,\n\n1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:51.840\n some but very few, have fought against every effort to improve the lives of the mass of people.\n\n1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:58.400\n The goal of a capitalist is to minimize labor costs. What that means is replace a worker with\n\n1:07:58.400 --> 1:08:07.200\n a machine, move the production from expensive U.S. to cheap China, bring in desperate immigrants from\n\n1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:11.520\n other parts of the world, because they will work for less money than the folks that you have here\n\n1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:18.240\n at home. Every measure to help the standard of living of American workers had to be fought for,\n\n1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:25.600\n had to be fought for, for decades over the opposition of capitalists from the beginning\n\n1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:32.080\n to right now. The reason we have a minimum wage, which was passed in the middle of the 1930s,\n\n1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:38.160\n when it was proposed, it was blocked by capitalists. They got together. And today,\n\n1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:45.520\n just a factoid for you, the last time the minimum wage was raised in the United States,\n\n1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:55.680\n federal minimum wage, was in 2009, when it was set at the lofty sum of $7.25 an hour,\n\n1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:03.920\n which you cannot live on. Over the last 12 years or so, whatever it is now, 11, 12, 13 years\n\n1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:10.640\n since then, we have had an increase in the price level in this country every year. And in the last\n\n1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:18.320\n year, 8.5%. During that time that the prices went up, the minimum wage was never raised.\n\n1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:31.520\n What? This is a time of stock market boom, of growing inequality. This is the nerve of the\n\n1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:39.360\n defender of capitalists, who wants now to get credit for the improvement in the standard of\n\n1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:45.040\n life of the workers that was fought by every generation. You know, it takes your breath away.\n\n1:09:45.040 --> 1:09:53.120\n It's an argument. Whoa. But I take my hat off if I had one, because that is one of the only ways\n\n1:09:53.120 --> 1:10:02.160\n to justify this system. Long ago\u2014let me get to the heart of it\u2014long ago, capitalism could have\n\n1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:10.640\n overcome hunger, could have overcome disease, could have, I mean, way beyond what we have now,\n\n1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:19.760\n but it didn't. And that's the worst moral condemnation imaginable. How do you justify\n\n1:10:20.800 --> 1:10:27.360\n that when you could, you didn't? Look, let me get at it another way, because this may\n\n1:10:27.360 --> 1:10:35.440\n interest you anyway. The issue is not that capitalism isn't technologically dynamic.\n\n1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:41.840\n It is. And along the way, it has developed things that have helped people's lives get better. No\n\n1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:50.560\n question. But the notion that the mass enjoyment of a rising standard of living is somehow built\n\n1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:59.360\n into capitalism is factually nuts and is such an outrageous\u2014and I can give you a\u2014because\n\n1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:05.840\n you do math, you'll understand it. Think of it this way. Imagine a production process in which\n\n1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:13.120\n you have $100 that the capitalist has to lay out for tools, equipment, and raw materials,\n\n1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:20.080\n and $100 that he has to lay out for workers, hire the workers. And he puts them all together,\n\n1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:26.880\n and he has an output. And let's say the output is 100 units of something, or whatever the price is,\n\n1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:35.040\n and that's his revenue. And when he takes his product and sells it and gets the revenue,\n\n1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:42.400\n let's say the revenue is\u2014it doesn't really matter\u2014it's $120, for lack of a better word.\n\n1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:49.520\n And he takes $100 of it and replaces the tools, equipment, and raw materials he used up,\n\n1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:54.240\n another $100 to hire the workers for the next shift, and the other $20 is his profit,\n\n1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:58.800\n and he puts that aside. Now along comes a technological breakthrough,\n\n1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:04.480\n a machine, a new machine. And the new machine is so effective,\n\n1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:13.920\n you can get the same number of units of output with half the workers. So you don't need to spend\n\n1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:20.400\n $100 on workers. You only need to spend $50. You can do it with half the workers. And so the\n\n1:12:20.400 --> 1:12:25.360\n capitalist goes to the workers\u2014by the way, this happens every day\u2014and he says to half of them,\n\n1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:31.280\n you're fired. Don't come back Monday morning. I don't need you. It's nothing personal. I got a\n\n1:12:31.280 --> 1:12:38.880\n machine. Why does he do that? Because of the $50 he now no longer has to spend on labor, because\n\n1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:44.640\n he doesn't need half of them. He keeps. Everything else is the same. The machine, everything else is\n\n1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:52.800\n just to make the math easy. So he keeps as his own profit the $50 that before he paid for those\n\n1:12:52.800 --> 1:12:58.480\n workers. Because when he sells it for $220, that $50 he doesn't have to give to the next\n\n1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:06.880\n job because he has a new machine. So that's what he does. The technology leads. He's happy. He's\n\n1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:13.120\n become more profitable. He's got an extra $50, which is why he buys the machine. The workers\n\n1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:20.640\n are screwed. Half of them just lost their job, have to go home to their husband and wife,\n\n1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:25.280\n tell them I don't have a job anymore. I didn't do anything wrong. The guy was nice enough to\n\n1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:31.600\n say it was nothing wrong with me, but he doesn't need it. So I'm completely screwed here. I don't\n\n1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:36.240\n know what I'm going to do about the debts we have, the house on mortgage, my children's education,\n\n1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:43.040\n or whatever else he's got going for himself. Now the point. There was, of course, an alternative\n\n1:13:43.040 --> 1:13:49.440\n path. The alternative path would have been to keep all the workers, pay them exactly the same that\n\n1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:58.160\n you did before, for half a day's work. You would have got the same output, same revenue, same\n\n1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:06.560\n profit as before. But the gain of the technology would have been a half a day of freedom every day\n\n1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:15.360\n of the lives of these workers. The majority of workers would have been really helped by this\n\n1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:23.280\n technology. But instead they were screwed so that one guy, the employer, could make a big bundle of\n\n1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:30.880\n more money. You want to support a system like this? Well, to go back to Hegel, the good and the bad.\n\n1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:37.360\n So you just listed the bad and you also first listed the good, the technological innovation\n\n1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:44.080\n of this kind of system. The question is the alternative, whatever, as we try to sneak up to\n\n1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.880\n ideas of what the alternative might look like, what are the good and the bad of the alternative?\n\n1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:56.800\n So you just kind of, as a opposite, by contrast, showed that, well, a nice alternative is you work\n\n1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:06.720\n less, get paid the same, you have more leisure time, opportunity to pursue other interests,\n\n1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:15.920\n the creative interests, family, flourish as a human being, basically strengthen and embolden\n\n1:15:15.920 --> 1:15:26.880\n the basic humanity that's under all of us. Yes. But then what cost does that have on the deadline\n\n1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:36.080\n fueled, competition fueled machine of technological innovation that is the positive side of capitalism?\n\n1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:37.360\n Slows it down.\n\n1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:44.080\n It slows it down. And the question is which is more important for the flourishing of humanity?\n\n1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:52.240\n I agree with that. And I'd love there to be a democratic mechanism. So let's discuss it,\n\n1:15:52.240 --> 1:15:57.360\n let's debate it, and then let's decide what mixture, because it's not either or,\n\n1:15:57.360 --> 1:16:03.600\n the math problem I gave you is either or, we could mix it. You could have a third less of a working\n\n1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:08.000\n day instead of a half less, and then the other part would be extra profit for our employer,\n\n1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:16.400\n etc. etc. So let's have a democratic discussion of what is the mix between the positive, and we have\n\n1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:22.880\n no such thing. All of this is decided by one side in this debate, which not only, we know what they\n\n1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:27.520\n do, they always choose the one that maximizes their profit because that's what they were told\n\n1:16:27.520 --> 1:16:34.160\n to do in business school where I've taught. So not only is it an undemocratic decision,\n\n1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:40.720\n but it's lopsided to boot. So we don't have the opportunity, but I would love for us to be good\n\n1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:46.720\n Hegelian Marxists and say, let's take a look at the plus and the minus and make the best decision\n\n1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:53.280\n that we can. We'll make mistakes, but we'll all make them together. It won't be one of us making\n\n1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:59.360\n a dictatorial decision. You know, Marx developed the notion of the dictatorship of the proletariat,\n\n1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:09.840\n not as a notion of how government works, but as a notion of what the practical reality is.\n\n1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:16.640\n The dictatorship in these key decisions is not made by some sitting council, it's made by each\n\n1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:22.800\n little capitalist in his or her relationships with the workers in the workplace, which is why Marx\n\n1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:28.560\n focused his analysis on that point. And by the way, I can sketch for you right now so it doesn't\n\n1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:34.080\n lurk in the background what the alternative is. Let's go there. Okay. It goes right back to what\n\n1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:42.480\n I said earlier. The workers themselves, the collection of employees together appropriate\n\n1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:51.920\n their own surplus and decide democratically what to do with it, which includes the decision of\n\n1:17:51.920 --> 1:18:01.040\n whether or not to buy a machine and whether or not to use the machine and the savings it might allow\n\n1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:12.160\n to be handled by more leisure for themselves or as a fund for new developments in technology or\n\n1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:20.720\n new products or whatever they want. And you know, this is an old idea in humans. Marx loved that.\n\n1:18:20.720 --> 1:18:27.760\n Toward the end of his life, he started reading extensively in anthropology. And one of the\n\n1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:33.520\n reasons he did that toward the end of his life was because he kept discovering that in this\n\n1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:40.560\n society and that one, including here in the United States, that there were examples of people who\n\n1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:50.000\n organized their production in precisely this way, as a collective democratic community in which\n\n1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:56.080\n everybody had an equal voice. So we all together decide democratically what to produce, how to\n\n1:18:56.080 --> 1:19:03.680\n produce, where to produce, and what to do with the output we all help to produce. So let's do it in,\n\n1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:13.360\n you know, in this country where democracy is a value nearly everybody subscribes to.\n\n1:19:13.360 --> 1:19:20.400\n Think about it this way, the stunning contradiction that there is a place in our society\n\n1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:28.080\n where democracy has never been allowed to enter. The workplace. In the workplace, a tiny group of\n\n1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:35.040\n people, unaccountable to the rest of us, the employer, whether that's an individual, a family,\n\n1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:43.040\n a partnership, or a corporate board of directors, tiny group of people controls economically a vast\n\n1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:49.520\n mass of employees. Those employees don't elect those people, have no nothing. There is no\n\n1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:56.960\n accountability. It is the most undemocratic arrangement imaginable. And this society\n\n1:19:56.960 --> 1:20:04.000\n insists on calling itself democratic when it has organized the minor matter of producing\n\n1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:11.440\n everything in a way that is the direct, it's autocratic. So to push back on a few things.\n\n1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:18.400\n So one is the idea of this society calling itself democratic is that the government is elected\n\n1:20:18.400 --> 1:20:24.160\n democratically and the government is able to pressure the workplace through the process of\n\n1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:31.040\n regulation. You pass laws of the boundaries of how, you know, minimum wage, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:37.360\n That's the one idea. The other is there is a natural force within the capitalist when there's\n\n1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:43.680\n no monopolies of competition being the accountability. So if you're a shitty boss,\n\n1:20:45.040 --> 1:20:50.880\n the employee in the capitalist system has the freedom to move to another company, work for a\n\n1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:56.880\n better boss. So that creates pressure on the employers and the bosses. That's at least the idea\n\n1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:05.440\n that there's two boundaries of you not misbehaving. One is the law, so regulations\n\n1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:11.600\n passed by the government, democratic. And the second is because there's always alternatives,\n\n1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:16.960\n in theory, then that puts pressure on everyone to behave well because you can always leave.\n\n1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:24.960\n So, I mean, that's kinds of accountability. But what you're saying is that does not result\n\n1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:32.720\n in a significant enough accountability for the employer that avoids exploitation of the worker.\n\n1:21:32.720 --> 1:21:39.040\n WOLFF Absolutely. I mean, whatever accountability you get in those mechanisms. And let me respond\n\n1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:48.560\n to that and then I'll counterargument. First, competition. Here again, we have to be Hegelians\n\n1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:56.880\n just a little. Competition destroys itself. It doesn't need any\u2014the whole point of competition\n\n1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:02.960\n is to beat the other guy. If I can produce the same product as the other guy, either a better\n\n1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:08.720\n quality or a lower price or maybe both, then I win because the customers will come to me\n\n1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:12.880\n because my price is lower or my quality is better, and they'll leave the other guy,\n\n1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:17.360\n he'll go out of business. Now, let's follow. When he goes out of business, because I've won\n\n1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:25.200\n the competition, he fires his workers. I hire them because I'm now going to be able to serve a market\n\n1:22:25.200 --> 1:22:33.360\n he can't serve anymore. So I'm going to buy the used equipment, and thereby many become few.\n\n1:22:34.400 --> 1:22:41.360\n Monopoly is the product of competition. It's not the antithesis, it's the product.\n\n1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:43.520\n LAROI Well, let's see.\n\n1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:44.720\n WOLFF That's where it comes from.\n\n1:22:44.720 --> 1:22:48.880\n LAROI There's another element to the system where there's always a new guy that comes in.\n\n1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:51.600\n WOLFF There isn't. There isn't.\n\n1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:58.800\n LAROI Well, that's the dream. The entrepreneurial spirit of the United States,\n\n1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:07.200\n for example, of a capitalist system is you can be broke and one day have a strong idea and build\n\n1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:14.880\n up a business that takes on Google and Facebook and Twitter and all the different car, Ford, GM,\n\n1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:20.400\n which is what you look at Tesla, for example. That's the American dream. One of the many\n\n1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:30.960\n ideals of the American dream is you can move from dirt poor to being the richest person in the world.\n\n1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:31.440\n WOLFF Right.\n\n1:23:31.440 --> 1:23:33.680\n LAROI It can happen.\n\n1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:34.480\n WOLFF It can happen.\n\n1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:37.520\n WOLFF You know what that's like? That's like you can win a lottery.\n\n1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:42.240\n LAROI No, that's not quite. No, the lottery is complete luck. Here,\n\n1:23:42.240 --> 1:23:44.320\n you can work your ass off if you have a good idea.\n\n1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:46.080\n WOLFF The odds are better in the lottery.\n\n1:23:46.080 --> 1:23:49.840\n LAROI That's not true. There's a lot of new businesses.\n\n1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:52.080\n WOLFF How many Teslas do you know?\n\n1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:54.080\n LAROI Tesla is a really bad example because the car\n\n1:23:54.080 --> 1:24:03.200\n company, the automotive sector is so difficult. They operate at such a thin margin of profit.\n\n1:24:03.920 --> 1:24:10.800\n They're probably a good example of capitalism just completely coming to a halt in terms of\n\n1:24:10.800 --> 1:24:16.880\n lack of innovation. That's a very complicated industry because of the supply chain.\n\n1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:23.280\n WOLFF Come on. They have their uniqueness as you're quite right, but so does every other\n\n1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:29.200\n industry. The one thing that's common is that many become few. What you can also have is when you\n\n1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:36.080\n have a few, they jack up the price. They make an enormous profit. In the irony of capitalism,\n\n1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:42.480\n Marx would love this, they begin to incentivize people to break into this industry because the\n\n1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:49.520\n few remaining are making a wild amount of profit because they are a few and can jigger the market\n\n1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:58.320\n to make it work like that for them. The reason every small capitalist is trying to build market\n\n1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:04.320\n share\u2014that's a polite way of saying they want to become a monopolist or to be more exact,\n\n1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:09.600\n an oligopolist, one of a handful of firms that dominates. That's what they're there for.\n\n1:25:09.600 --> 1:25:16.160\n PEDRO But yeah, to push back a little bit also, because this is a question also,\n\n1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:22.960\n do you think we're in danger of oversimplifying capitalism that completely removes the basic\n\n1:25:22.960 --> 1:25:34.240\n decency of human beings? If you give me a choice to press a button to get rid of the competition,\n\n1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:38.080\n but that's going to lead to a lot of suffering, there's a lot of people at the heads of companies\n\n1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:43.520\n that won't press that button. That it's not in the calculation, it's not just money,\n\n1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:47.680\n it's human well being too. So like\u2014\n\n1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:48.240\n PEDRO You think?\n\n1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:50.400\n PEDRO Yes.\n\n1:25:50.400 --> 1:25:53.360\n PEDRO You and I don't live in the same place then.\n\n1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:56.320\n PEDRO So you're saying that the forces of capitalism\n\n1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:01.840\n take over the minds of the people at the top, and then they cease being human.\n\n1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:02.640\n PEDRO No.\n\n1:26:02.640 --> 1:26:07.040\n PEDRO Depending on your model of humans.\n\n1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:08.000\n PEDRO Yeah.\n\n1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.560\n PEDRO They lose track of the better angels of their nature,\n\n1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:15.520\n and they just become cogs in the machine, but they just happen to be the cock at the top.\n\n1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:20.080\n PEDRO I would put it differently. The system is so set up, it's a little bit like natural\n\n1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:26.320\n selection. The guys who may\u2014I could say the women too, it doesn't matter\u2014the people who make it up\n\n1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:32.240\n through the layers of the bureaucracy and get to the top in these things have had to do things along\n\n1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:38.400\n the way that become selective. If they can't stand it because they have that human quality\u2014and there\n\n1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:45.760\n are people, I've known them\u2014they're the ones running an Airbnb in Vermont. They went there and\n\n1:26:45.760 --> 1:26:49.760\n they said, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not going to treat people like that. I'm going to\n\n1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:56.000\n make a lovely place in Vermont with my husband or my wife or whatever, and I'm going to be enjoying\n\n1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:04.480\n the people that come by and be a decent\u2014of course, of course. But the system selects the firm. If you\n\n1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:10.400\n don't do what has to be done to make the profit go up, you're toast there anyway. The rest of the\n\n1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:15.120\n people who vote for you are going to kick you out. You can tell them all day long what a lovely\n\n1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:19.360\n person you are. Then they're going to look at you and wonder what happened to you. How did you even\n\n1:27:19.360 --> 1:27:25.520\n get this far with the lovely person horseshoe? RL It's not necessarily just a lovely person.\n\n1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:34.240\n So maybe my\u2014I'll just say my bias is the people I know are, especially at the top of companies,\n\n1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:44.480\n are in the tech sector where innovation is such a big part of it. So I think a lot of the things\n\n1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:49.840\n we're talking about is when there's not much innovation in the system. So\u2014\n\n1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:56.480\n RL Innovation usually comes\u2014in the history of capitalism, innovation comes in spurts.\n\n1:27:56.480 --> 1:28:01.680\n There's the electric period, the chemistry period, the nuclear period. There's now whatever you want\n\n1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:08.720\n to call it, the artificial intelligence or robotics or computer. It comes, and then there's a flurry\n\n1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:15.920\n as everything is reorganized around whatever the newest technology is, and then you have a period\n\n1:28:15.920 --> 1:28:21.680\n where you can get excited about that, and the very rich people who come to the top can talk endlessly,\n\n1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:32.240\n as they always do, about innovation. But again, it really is\u2014this is a recurring kind of debate and\n\n1:28:32.240 --> 1:28:41.440\n a recurring kind of issue. For me\u2014how do I put this in a way that\u2014no, I don't mean to offend.\n\n1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:49.040\n RL Please, please. RL No, no, no, I don't. I don't want to, but\n\n1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:57.440\n the problem with capitalism is\u2014and maybe you'll like this\u2014the problem with capitalism is\n\n1:28:58.800 --> 1:29:03.600\n not that it is the one thing that's consistent with human nature. That's what its defenders\n\n1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.480\n would like to have us believe. But if anything, I would argue the opposite,\n\n1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:18.560\n that it is such a contradiction to parts of our nature, not other parts, that it can never quite\n\n1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:24.480\n make it. There's always going to be the people who don't go along with it, people you're talking\n\n1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:32.240\n about, who do quit along the way, or maybe a few of them actually make it to the top by god knows\n\n1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:39.280\n what hook or what crook that they did it. But most of them go\u2014and you know why? Because their\n\n1:29:39.280 --> 1:29:48.560\n humanity is contradicted by what it is they're being asked to do. I mean, the corporate sector\n\n1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:58.160\n this year\u2014just to give you an idea\u2014CEOs are jacking up their wage package. They're already\n\n1:29:58.160 --> 1:30:04.480\n out of whack. I mean, the average CEO pay is now three, three hundred times what the average worker\n\n1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:09.600\n pay is. But they're jacking it up even more. Why? Because that's what's happening in their universe.\n\n1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.920\n That's what\u2014they're all doing it, and they have to do\u2014each one of them justifies that,\n\n1:30:13.920 --> 1:30:18.320\n I have to do that, otherwise I'd lose my guy to the next one. Which, of course, is true,\n\n1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:22.960\n but is no comfort for the mass of people who aren't CEOs, for whom this argument isn't very\n\n1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:32.000\n exciting. So they're doing that at a time when the American people can't cope. They've just gone\n\n1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:38.320\n through the COVID disaster. They've gone through the second worst economic crash of capitalism\n\n1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:46.160\n in our history. After two years of this one, two punch, they got an inflation, a third punch,\n\n1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:50.640\n and we are now predicting rising interest rates and a recession at the end of the year\n\n1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:55.760\n or early next year. You can't do this to a working class. When this was done to the\n\n1:30:55.760 --> 1:31:02.160\n German working class in the 1920s, Hitler was the result. You keep doing that in this country,\n\n1:31:02.160 --> 1:31:07.360\n we're already watching it, you're going to get that too. You're already getting bits and pieces.\n\n1:31:07.360 --> 1:31:11.920\n You can't keep doing it. So there's a quiet suffering amidst the working class that's growing.\n\n1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:12.880\n Horror. Taking out on\u2014\n\n1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:16.560\n That can turn to anger. Some little 18 year old kid who has to go\n\n1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:24.320\n three hours in his car and blow away people in a supermarket. Huh? What? And it happens\n\n1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:26.080\n every day in this country. Every day.\n\n1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:33.040\n So that anger rises up in those little ways now and then bigger and bigger potentially.\n\n1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:40.320\n By the way, there's one more thing on the rationality. And this goes to Elon Musk.\n\n1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:47.440\n If you're interested, 49,000 people were killed in automobile accidents this last year. The number\n\n1:31:47.440 --> 1:31:54.320\n was just released yesterday. 49,000. Automobiles are the single largest pollutant in the country.\n\n1:31:54.320 --> 1:32:01.120\n They use up an enormous amount of energy. They use up enormous amount of resources.\n\n1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:07.840\n There is a way to make transportation much more rational. And we've known it for decades. It's\n\n1:32:07.840 --> 1:32:15.680\n called mass transportation. It's a really beautifully maintained, crystal clear, clean,\n\n1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:25.520\n frequent system of buses, trains, street trolleys, vans. It could easily be done in this society.\n\n1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:31.680\n In fact, I once did a project that I estimated cost $30 billion. That's less than we're sending\n\n1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:35.280\n to Ukraine to do this, to reconfigure it.\n\n1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:37.600\n A public transit system where?\n\n1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:41.440\n Everywhere in this country. All the major metropolitan. This country's overwhelmingly\n\n1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:42.480\n metropolitan area.\n\n1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:46.000\n Well, it clearly has to be more than 30 billion, but...\n\n1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:47.520\n Well, it was a few years ago.\n\n1:32:47.520 --> 1:32:50.960\n Sure. But you're saying it's a little bit more than 30 billion.\n\n1:32:50.960 --> 1:32:57.680\n But I'm using a lot of this. Right. It's not crazy stuff.\n\n1:32:57.680 --> 1:32:58.960\n It's a reasonable number.\n\n1:32:58.960 --> 1:32:59.440\n Right. Right.\n\n1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:01.360\n Hey, listen, but there's a...\n\n1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:02.560\n Let me just finish the point.\n\n1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:03.360\n Sure. Yes.\n\n1:33:03.360 --> 1:33:12.640\n Okay. So I'm trying to be rational here. If we have a climate crisis, which everyone tells me we do,\n\n1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:18.640\n if it's got a lot to do with fossil fuels, which everybody tells me it has to do, and with the use\n\n1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:24.400\n of the fossil fuel, particularly for the automobile, then the solution to the problem would be mass\n\n1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:29.680\n transit. We're doing nothing to make that happen. Nothing.\n\n1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:37.360\n Well, you could argue that autonomous vehicles is a kind of public transit because it's going to be\n\n1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:44.400\n reusable vehicles. It will end, in theory, car ownership. So you just have a more kind of\n\n1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:45.680\n distributed public transit system.\n\n1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:51.520\n If it happens, but you know that that's a side effect. His major goal and the major goal of the\n\n1:33:51.520 --> 1:33:58.400\n other companies that are busy squeezing to get his share of the pie smaller, so they have some,\n\n1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:04.080\n Ford, General Motors, Toyota, all of them are making electric cars now. So what they've done is\n\n1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:09.840\n they've replaced the individual car with fossil fuel with another individual car.\n\n1:34:09.840 --> 1:34:10.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:10.320 --> 1:34:12.880\n That's fucking nuts. What are you doing?\n\n1:34:12.880 --> 1:34:17.600\n Well, that's one of the things they're doing, but automation is also another one. But on the Elon\n\n1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:24.000\n side, there's also a hilarious thing named Boring Company, which is working on tunnels, which is\n\n1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:31.600\n actually expanding the flexibility you might have to start playing with ideas of public transit,\n\n1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:37.920\n I think. Listen, I'm now partially living in Austin, Texas, that I don't know if they know\n\n1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:40.000\n what a public transit system is, period.\n\n1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:40.480\n Yes.\n\n1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:41.520\n There's F150 pickup trucks.\n\n1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:43.200\n Most American cities are.\n\n1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:43.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.720\n Well, this is an interesting, so.\n\n1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:53.360\n The older, by the way, footnote, the older this city, the more likely it has public transportation.\n\n1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:54.800\n So you're saying.\n\n1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:56.240\n Boston is the best example.\n\n1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:56.880\n Yes.\n\n1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.160\n Have you been, well, you.\n\n1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:00.320\n Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I have a place in Boston.\n\n1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:05.040\n Boston with the street railway, Boston is your case study of how to do this,\n\n1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:07.840\n because they've been doing it all along. New York's pretty good, too.\n\n1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.280\n There's a tradeoff. Yeah, New York, I would say, is better than Boston because\n\n1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:17.120\n so there's, you know, their technology also helps you out to do the public transit better.\n\n1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:21.120\n It's almost like Boston is a little too old, but yes, I get your point.\n\n1:35:21.760 --> 1:35:29.600\n But there is a, the Ford F150 pickup truck symbolizes something about America,\n\n1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:35.680\n and there is a practical nature to the fact that in order to do public transit,\n\n1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:42.320\n in order to do some of these things that you're talking about with the working class,\n\n1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:48.000\n there has to be a central planning component, or there has to be a centralized component.\n\n1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:55.200\n And America is very much based on the idea of, at least in recent times,\n\n1:35:55.200 --> 1:35:59.840\n I would say from the founding, of individualism, of respecting individual freedom.\n\n1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:06.880\n Are you worried that in order to bring some of these ideas of Marxism to life,\n\n1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:10.080\n you would trample on individual freedoms?\n\n1:36:10.080 --> 1:36:10.560\n No.\n\n1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:13.360\n Can you respect both?\n\n1:36:13.360 --> 1:36:20.560\n Sure. For me, Marxism is a way to enhance the individual freedom of the mass of people\n\n1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:26.880\n who have had that freedom eroded under the capitalist. That's a motive for my Marxism.\n\n1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:34.800\n It was for Marx too. He loved the French Revolution. He loved the libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9,\n\n1:36:34.800 --> 1:36:39.520\n the great three, and then democracy, the American contribution, if you like.\n\n1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:44.160\n He believed in all of that. His critique of capitalism was, it promised it,\n\n1:36:44.880 --> 1:36:49.280\n and then never delivered it. And the reason you have to go beyond it is because\n\n1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:59.440\n it didn't deliver what it had promised. So for me, it is the fulfillment of agenda.\n\n1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:08.960\n But again, I'm a Hegelian Marxist, if you want. Individualism, for me, is not the way it's set\n\n1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:18.160\n up in this society, some sort of antithesis to the government. I think an immense con has been\n\n1:37:18.160 --> 1:37:24.880\n pulled on the American people. And the con works like this. You know what's bad and what's dangerous\n\n1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:29.200\n and threatens you? It's the government. The government's going to come in and tell you\n\n1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:33.600\n what to do. The government's going to run your life. The government's the problem.\n\n1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:37.520\n There really is no other way to explain the following in American politics.\n\n1:37:39.040 --> 1:37:44.000\n Large numbers of people lose their homes in a downturn, like the so called Great\n\n1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:51.600\n Recession of 2008. Who do they blame? The government. Large numbers of people go unemployed,\n\n1:37:51.600 --> 1:37:58.720\n and what is the media all about? The government. If I were a capitalist, I'd love this. I kick the\n\n1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:03.840\n workers by throwing them out of their home, and they don't get angry at me. They get angry at the\n\n1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:09.200\n government. I fire large numbers of people. I have no responsibility for what happens to them as a\n\n1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:16.080\n result of having no job and no income. And they get angry at the senator. I'm laughing all the way\n\n1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:23.520\n to the bank. This is a genius stroke. In theory. But if you look at government, because you said\n\n1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:27.840\n accountability in the capitalist system has no accountability. There's some pushback I give on\n\n1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:32.240\n the accountability. I think there is some accountability we can discuss in a Hegelian way.\n\n1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:40.320\n Who there's more accountability for. I would say that in theory, government is perfectly\n\n1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:46.400\n accountable. That's the whole point of a democratic system is you vote people in. In practice,\n\n1:38:46.400 --> 1:38:52.560\n there's a giant growing bureaucracy that is accountable only on the surface. There's two\n\n1:38:52.560 --> 1:39:03.120\n parties that seem to be the same. Media somehow integrated into making the same two parties that\n\n1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:09.360\n are just wearing different colored shirts to seem like they're very opposed and are arguing and\n\n1:39:09.360 --> 1:39:16.240\n bitterly arguing and calling each other's nasty names and all those kinds of things. But that's\n\n1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:24.400\n government. So who exactly is worse here? Government or companies? Well, why are we asking\n\n1:39:24.400 --> 1:39:31.600\n that question? These are twins. Look, what you were able to say about Republicans and Democrats\n\n1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:36.480\n just now, with which I agree. I would say the same thing about corporations and the government.\n\n1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:42.480\n This is the same people. Literally. Let's go to Churchill. Which one is worse? Let's go to\n\n1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:47.920\n Churchill. Democracy is the worst form of government except all the other ones or whatever.\n\n1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:52.960\n So this kind of same idea. Which one exactly is worse? Because to me, it seems like...\n\n1:39:52.960 --> 1:39:54.640\n Which one between what and what?\n\n1:39:54.640 --> 1:40:01.120\n Government and industry and companies. It's because government is plagued by...\n\n1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:10.000\n I would call it corruption because the corruption of bureaucratic paperwork.\n\n1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:15.600\n But they're not accountable. There doesn't seem to be a serious accountability.\n\n1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:22.720\n Again, we're not living on the same planet. The greatest practitioners of central planning\n\n1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:32.400\n are corporations. Elon has an operation like General Motors, Ford, IBM, or any of the other\n\n1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:40.080\n megacorps. They have to plan. They buy up companies because they don't want to deal\n\n1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:46.880\n in the market. They don't want the insecurity, the uncertainty of having to buy their inputs\n\n1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:53.120\n or sell their outputs to somebody they don't control. They want the professor to teach the\n\n1:40:53.120 --> 1:40:59.680\n genius of a market. They hate the market. And when they grow to be big, they keep buying\n\n1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:04.400\n whoever they were dealing with before so they could better control them, which requires them\n\n1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:12.000\n then to plan the production and distribution of goods inside rather than buying them in the market.\n\n1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:18.960\n The model of the government is it's a private corporation. I have spent my life...\n\n1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:25.280\n I'll give you an example. In American universities, big ones, famous ones, not just as a student but as\n\n1:41:25.280 --> 1:41:29.920\n a professor. I've been half a dozen schools. I teach now at the new school here. It's another one,\n\n1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:37.760\n right? They all model themselves after businesses. They model their... You can attack the bureaucracy\n\n1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:44.640\n of universities. Good reason. It's a mess. But they're proudly modeling themselves\n\n1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:53.760\n on organizing their bureaucracy in a businesslike manner. So you're looking at a difference which\n\n1:41:53.760 --> 1:42:00.880\n isn't there. The government and the private sector are partners, and both of them wouldn't have it\n\n1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:07.440\n any other way. The corporations want that from the government, and the government now knows that to\n\n1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:14.000\n please the corporations is the number one objective they have because that's how they keep their jobs\n\n1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:20.480\n and keep their system going. And so for all practical purposes, this is the same people.\n\n1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:27.840\n But there's important differences that I don't know if they're fundamental or just a consequence\n\n1:42:27.840 --> 1:42:32.800\n of history. But if you have government, they're accountable in a different way than companies.\n\n1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:38.960\n Companies are accountable by... Especially if you have a consumer, they're accountable by sort of\n\n1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:43.120\n the consumer spending or not spending their money on whatever the heck the company is selling.\n\n1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:49.840\n Right. The government is accountable by votes. And it seems like\n\n1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:58.480\n government, unlike companies, for most of company's history, is always too big to fail, meaning\n\n1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:04.320\n it can always just print money. It can always save itself. And that creates a bureaucracy.\n\n1:43:06.000 --> 1:43:12.480\n You rarely pay the cost of having made bad decisions if you're in government. You\n\n1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:19.200\n distribute the blame, and it's very unclear who's responsible for bad decisions. So bad decisions\n\n1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:25.920\n in government accumulate. So you become more and more and more inefficient and more and more poor\n\n1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:30.320\n in your decision making in terms of, you said, public transit. Should we build a public transit\n\n1:43:30.320 --> 1:43:36.320\n system in this city or not? That's a difficult decision. That's an interesting decision. I would\n\n1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:42.560\n say it's very often a very good decision. But whoever makes that decision should be accountable\n\n1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:47.920\n for a good or bad decision. And it seems like companies are more accountable. They pay...\n\n1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:57.200\n They feel the pain of having made a bad decision more because it can go bankrupt. There's much more\n\n1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:03.680\n day to day pressure to make good engineering decisions. Government doesn't seem to be under\n\n1:44:03.680 --> 1:44:10.160\n the same level of pressure. Do you disagree with that? I disagree with that. Everything in my\n\n1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:20.320\n history pushes me. You may be living... I may be living in a different planet or taking a different\n\n1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:27.840\n sort of drug. I won't mention the name, but I personally had a lot to do with a very large\n\n1:44:27.840 --> 1:44:37.760\n company here in the United States, here in the New York area. And it involved two brothers and\n\n1:44:37.760 --> 1:44:47.120\n a family who built it up into a huge corporation. One of the brothers was kind of the dynamo\n\n1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:52.640\n of the family. And he was more responsible than anybody else building it up.\n\n1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:56.960\n But he took care of his brothers. He had a nice feeling about his brothers. So, the one brother\n\n1:44:56.960 --> 1:45:05.440\n who could not, you know, without help tie his shoes, became a vice president. Got an enormous\n\n1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:12.560\n salary. Got a beautiful office in a skyscraper, not that many blocks from where I'm sitting right\n\n1:45:12.560 --> 1:45:23.120\n now. And that was the way that family handled that company. And all of his relatives that were\n\n1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:31.120\n somewhere in this company doing a variety of whatever, because... And my experience with this,\n\n1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:37.920\n and because I went to the schools, I told you, all my experiences with that group of people,\n\n1:45:37.920 --> 1:45:44.480\n corporate experiences, full of those stories. You know, they made mistake after mistake,\n\n1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:52.560\n which they would tell you didn't undermine. They were always able to blame somebody else,\n\n1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:58.240\n something else that scraped them through. And had they not been able to, they would have been\n\n1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:05.280\n replaced by another person who did the same thing for as long as they could. And they knew it. They\n\n1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:13.280\n would talk about it at family events. That's how I know. I understand that you want the outside\n\n1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:17.280\n world to look at it this way, but it's not my experience.\n\n1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:25.120\n But again, that kind of thing, at the risk of saying human nature again, I wonder what\n\n1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:36.480\n kind of system allows for that more versus less. This is the question of, I would call that, let's\n\n1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:42.240\n put that under the umbrella term of corruption. Which system allows for more corruption?\n\n1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.320\n But remember that the way I defined the different system is not more or less government.\n\n1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:55.280\n It's more or less allowing a democratic workplace, reconfiguring it. What happens when everybody\n\n1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:01.760\n has a vote? When you have to explain what the strategies are, what the alternatives are to a\n\n1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:08.240\n larger number of people than a board of directors or major shareholders or whoever it is that most\n\n1:47:08.240 --> 1:47:13.840\n companies are responsible to. And now you've got a whole different universe. It's not a small group\n\n1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:18.400\n that can't be hidden the way it's normally hidden, most of it, and on and on and on.\n\n1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:25.200\n Worker coops is what this is called in many parts of the world. So it's not that I'm advocating\n\n1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:32.400\n something that's never been seen before, not at all. The Marxism I understand is to pick from\n\n1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:40.560\n historical precedents the things that we think will work better. And I think if all the people\n\n1:47:40.560 --> 1:47:45.600\n in enterprise, just to drive the point home, democratically decided they would never give\n\n1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:50.880\n two or three individuals 100 million dollars while everybody else can't send their kid to\n\n1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:59.280\n college. I mean they can do that. So just to return, just to address this point about the\n\n1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:05.440\n particular implementation of Marxism that was the early days in the Soviet Union. Why did\n\n1:48:05.440 --> 1:48:12.240\n Stalinism, for example, lead to so much bloodshed, do you think, and human suffering? Is there any\n\n1:48:12.240 --> 1:48:23.280\n elements within the ideas of Marxism that catalyzed the kind of government, the kind of system that\n\n1:48:23.280 --> 1:48:29.600\n led to that bloodshed? I don't think so. I think there were many things that led to the bloodshed\n\n1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:41.040\n and to all that Stalin's regimes did. And I spent 10 years of my life with another economist writing\n\n1:48:41.040 --> 1:48:49.280\n a book about that to try to explain from a Marxist position the rise and fall of the Soviet Union.\n\n1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:56.160\n You might want to take a look at it sometime. I'm going to say a few things now, but all of\n\n1:48:56.160 --> 1:49:05.360\n those things are spelled out in great detail with loads of empirical evidence, etc. in that work.\n\n1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:09.200\n Let me start with playing a little bit with Hegel.\n\n1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:21.360\n The biggest impact that Marxism had on the Soviet Union was really not so much what the Soviet Union\n\n1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:29.200\n did, but what the rest of the world did. You had a really interesting move, and I'll give you a\n\n1:49:29.200 --> 1:49:40.240\n parallel from today. The move was that the old Russian regime collapsed. World War I, it fell\n\n1:49:40.240 --> 1:49:46.800\n apart. The Tsar and all of that, it couldn't survive. It had already been in trouble. There\n\n1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:53.520\n was a revolution in 1905. There was the loss of the war to Japan. If you know Russian history,\n\n1:49:53.520 --> 1:50:01.760\n which I assume you do, you'll know that there was a lot leading up to the collapse in 1917.\n\n1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:09.840\n In some ways, it was fortuitous that the political group, very small, that could seize\n\n1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:17.440\n the opportunity of that collapse, happened to be Marxists. Earlier on with Kerensky,\n\n1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:23.920\n the first government that tried, it wasn't people all that impressed by Marxism. It was people more\n\n1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:31.920\n skeptical and would not have been called Marxist, probably, by history. They tried. They couldn't.\n\n1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:36.960\n Lenin and his associates were able to take over from them later in that same year.\n\n1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:45.760\n The rest of the world, though, was horrified. The rest of the world saw Marxism having taken\n\n1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:53.840\n this immense leap from being a political party, a movement, critical of capitalism, yes,\n\n1:50:54.480 --> 1:51:01.840\n but still not challenging the power. Now it had the power, and in a big country. And they freaked\n\n1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:10.400\n out. If you know American history, the leadership of this country went completely berserk. I mean,\n\n1:51:10.400 --> 1:51:17.600\n we had a repression of the left, the likes of which we had not seen before. The 20s were a time\n\n1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:27.760\n of Palmer raids in Boston, the Sacco Vanzetti trials, I mean, really grim hostility. And you\n\n1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:33.280\n had the four countries agreeing to invade the Soviet Union to try to crush the revolution.\n\n1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:41.520\n The US, Britain, France, and Japan all attacked 10,000 American troops. So what you had right away\n\n1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:51.040\n was a notion in the West that this was unthinkable. There was a great professor at Princeton,\n\n1:51:51.040 --> 1:51:58.960\n Meier, I forget his first name, who wrote this wonderful book about all American foreign policy\n\n1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:08.480\n since 1917 has been obsessed with Russia. Even now, this fight with Ukraine is half about Russia,\n\n1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:14.400\n as if Russia still was the Soviet Union, as if people haven't figured out. That was a big\n\n1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:23.680\n change back in 1989 and 90. Yeltsin and Putin are not what you had before, or at least they're not\n\n1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:31.600\n Lenin. They may not be so different from some of the other, but in any case. So you had one factor\n\n1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:41.920\n was the utter isolation, the utter condemnation, the global. I mean, Rosa Luxemburg, I assume you\n\n1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:48.480\n know, Rosa Luxemburg is hunted down in the streets of Berlin. She's a critic of Lenin's, by the way,\n\n1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:54.800\n but she's a leftist, hunted down and hacked into bits, killed. So you're attributing some\n\n1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:01.440\n of the bloodshed to the fact that basically the rest of the world turned away.\n\n1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:05.840\n Turned against. Turned against. So you turn against is the better word.\n\n1:53:05.840 --> 1:53:13.520\n I mean, not in order of importance, but it's a very important part of the psychology of being,\n\n1:53:13.520 --> 1:53:19.760\n you know, it's what you would call paranoid if there weren't quite as much evidence that indeed\n\n1:53:19.760 --> 1:53:24.560\n there was a lot to be afraid of at that time. Nobody had ever done it. Look, you could see the\n\n1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:31.600\n effects of it by Stalin inventing the idea, which had no support at first, that you could have\n\n1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:38.640\n socialism in one country. That was thought to be ridiculous, that socialism was internationalism.\n\n1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:45.040\n Marx was against capitalism everywhere. It was, you know, workers of the world unite,\n\n1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:54.640\n not workers of Russia unite. He had to go through a procedure of kind of coming to terms\n\n1:53:54.640 --> 1:54:00.080\n with the fact that the revolution he had in Russia, which was tried in Berlin,\n\n1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:06.320\n was tried in Munich, was tried in Budapest, was tried in Seattle here. They all failed.\n\n1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:14.880\n They all failed, and he's left. So the French would say, tout \u00e7a, right? All alone. That's one.\n\n1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:23.840\n The second thing is economic isolation. Russia's a poor country, and it needed what it got before\n\n1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:28.400\n the war, which were heavy investments from the French and the Germans particularly, but others\n\n1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:36.480\n too. Now this was all cut off, and you can see the replay with the sanctions program. We're going to\n\n1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:41.440\n do it again. We're going to do it again. We have to do it. The world is different, and the sanctions\n\n1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:49.280\n don't work, but they're going to trial, because it's the history. But that culture today is\n\n1:54:49.280 --> 1:54:54.720\n completely different. Russia's a different place today, but Russia has China, and that changes\n\n1:54:54.720 --> 1:55:00.080\n everything. And they don't get that here yet, but they will. Yeah, there's a very complicated\n\n1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:08.880\n dynamic with China, even with India. Yep. Or Turkey, Brazil. Sorry to say, human nature may\n\n1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:15.760\n change at a slower pace. Yes, that has occurred to me as well. I get that point. So is there,\n\n1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:22.400\n can you steel man the case, or consider the case, that there's something about the implementation\n\n1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:29.040\n of Marxism, maybe because of the idealistic nature of focusing on the working class and\n\n1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:38.160\n workers unite, that naturally leads to a formation of a dictatorial force, a dictator that says,\n\n1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:46.960\n let us temporarily give power to this person to manage some of the details of how to run the\n\n1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:54.080\n democracy, of giving voice to the workers so that they get to choose. And then that naturally\n\n1:55:54.080 --> 1:56:00.000\n leads to a dictator, and there's naturally, in human nature, power and absolute power,\n\n1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:07.520\n as the old adage goes, corrupts absolutely. Is it possible that whenever you focus on Marxist ideals,\n\n1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:13.440\n you're going to end up with a dictator, and often, when you give too much power to anyone human,\n\n1:56:13.440 --> 1:56:18.320\n a small number of people, you're going to get into a huge amount of trouble? You've\n\n1:56:18.320 --> 1:56:22.960\n putched things together there that I would... That's what... I think if you give...\n\n1:56:22.960 --> 1:56:25.840\n Putched is a good word. Yeah. It's German.\n\n1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:33.520\n Remember, I told you, my mother was born in Germany. And then your dad is French.\n\n1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:39.600\n Yeah, but he was born in Metz, if you know European. It's a city on the border of France\n\n1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:45.520\n and Germany. If you come from Alsatians, Alsass in German.\n\n1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:46.880\n So they're German speaking, French speaking?\n\n1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:52.560\n Yeah, they're both. It's bilingual because it's been back and forth so many times\n\n1:56:52.560 --> 1:56:56.960\n in medieval days already that it... Literally, you go from one store to another,\n\n1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:00.640\n the proprietor here is French and the proprietor there is German,\n\n1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:06.320\n but they all speak both languages because... You don't speak either of them?\n\n1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:07.280\n I speak Russian.\n\n1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:12.400\n Russian, but not German or French? Ukrainian, no. It took French for four years\n\n1:57:12.400 --> 1:57:16.880\n in high school, but I've forgotten all of it. I remember the romance and the spirit\n\n1:57:16.880 --> 1:57:19.440\n of the language, but not the details. I'm sure I can remember.\n\n1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:30.160\n If you allocate power unequally, undemocratically, and you do it for a very long period of time,\n\n1:57:30.160 --> 1:57:40.000\n and you do it on many levels of ideology, it is not surprising that it sticks and it stays.\n\n1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:45.600\n And you can make a political revolution or even an economic revolution and you will discover\n\n1:57:45.600 --> 1:57:51.680\n it has a life of its own and it's going to take a long time before people don't.\n\n1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:59.520\n If you have a religious tradition, Christianity, that prides itself on its monotheism\n\n1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:04.000\n and that it doesn't want to have anything to do with the old Greek mythologies when there was\n\n1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:09.520\n Zeus and Diana and all the others, and they were very humanlike, but instead we have one\n\n1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.600\n who is the absolute beginning. What are you doing? You're teaching people\n\n1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:23.360\n an authority line that comes from the individual. If you have a sequence of kings,\n\n1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:29.520\n if in your feudal manner the lord sits called the landlord and he has unspeakable power\n\n1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:34.400\n over everything that goes on, and you do this for thousands of years,\n\n1:58:35.200 --> 1:58:42.240\n you can make a Russian revolution in 1917. But if you imagine you've gotten away from all that\n\n1:58:42.240 --> 1:58:49.760\n people assume without ever thinking about it, you're going to have trouble. Stalin is figured\n\n1:58:49.760 --> 1:58:58.080\n here as the originator of his situation. He wasn't. He never had that power. He may have thought that,\n\n1:58:58.080 --> 1:59:05.680\n but I don't. He's the product. Look, the Cuban people made Fidel, who really wasn't that kind\n\n1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:12.240\n of guy. You know, he's a baseball playing lawyer. That's what he was. But they made him into Tala.\n\n1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:20.880\n So you're the product of history. No, no, no. It was the systems, feudalism, the nature,\n\n1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:27.840\n it was the structures and institutions that cultivated in people a mentality that has its\n\n1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:33.280\n own rhythm and doesn't follow the calendar of a political revolution.\n\n1:59:33.280 --> 1:59:36.240\n That's the fundamental question. Is there something about communism\n\n1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:44.320\n that creates a mentality that enables somebody like Stalin or Mao?\n\n1:59:44.320 --> 1:59:51.120\n No, I think it's the social issues and problems the society has that make them then go to what\n\n1:59:51.120 --> 1:59:56.640\n they find familiar, to what seems to make sense, and he's the guy. Look, let me give you an example\n\n1:59:56.640 --> 2:00:02.880\n from American history. The Republican Party has traditionally in this country been the party of\n\n2:00:02.880 --> 2:00:09.840\n private enterprise and minimum government. In comes Trump, runs for office in 2016,\n\n2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:19.120\n is elected. What does he do? He commences the most massive tax increase and the most\n\n2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:26.880\n massive government intervention in the worlds of economics that we've had for decades. Nobody says\n\n2:00:26.880 --> 2:00:38.320\n anything. The Republicans cave and the Democrats largely too. They cave. He can throw a tariff on\n\n2:00:38.320 --> 2:00:43.760\n anything. He gets up in front of the American people and he says the Chinese will pay the tariff.\n\n2:00:44.480 --> 2:00:50.320\n That's not what a tariff is. It's not how a tariff works. He would flunk a freshman course\n\n2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:57.120\n in economics, which everybody knows, everybody who teaches these courses. No, it doesn't matter. He's\n\n2:00:57.120 --> 2:01:03.840\n still calling the shots. What is going on here is that a society has come to a point where it can't\n\n2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:14.960\n solve its problems and it begins what? To tap into older forms and all of the laissez faire\n\n2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:22.560\n and all of the individualism. And suddenly the Republican Party is gung ho. And now they're\n\n2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:28.560\n going to make abortion illegal. The government is telling you what you can do with your uterus.\n\n2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:36.240\n What? What? The government is being given more and more and more and more power. They're hoping\n\n2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:43.200\n what? Do they like the government? No. They're desperate. This is not a pro government\n\n2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:51.440\n and it wasn't in Russia either. They were in a desperate fix and so, and he took advantage.\n\n2:01:52.320 --> 2:02:01.040\n So to which degree would you say Marx's ideas led to the creation of the\n\n2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:11.280\n National Socialism Party of German workers, hence the Nazi Party, the fascist party in the 30s\n\n2:02:11.280 --> 2:02:17.360\n and the 40s at the head of whom was Hitler, which I just recently learned he was\n\n2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:23.680\n employee number seven of the party or whatever, the seventh person to have joined the party\n\n2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:30.080\n and have created one of the most consequential and powerful political parties in the history\n\n2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:38.000\n of the 20th century. What degree did Marx's ideas, Marxism ideas have to play? It is the National\n\n2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:50.080\n Socialist Party of German workers. Right. Workers. National Socialist Deutsche Arbeiter Partei,\n\n2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:56.560\n German Worker Party. Worker Party. National Socialist German Worker Party. So. Well here's\n\n2:02:56.560 --> 2:03:03.280\n the history. Did he care about the workers or did he just use the workers as a populist message?\n\n2:03:03.280 --> 2:03:10.960\n The only thing that Marxism did for Mr. Hitler was provide him with his stepping stone to power,\n\n2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:14.560\n but had nothing, no other, he didn't know anything about it, didn't care anything about it,\n\n2:03:14.560 --> 2:03:18.000\n nor did the people around him. Here's the story of what happened there,\n\n2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:23.600\n which I know largely through my own family and plus my own history, the work that I did.\n\n2:03:25.360 --> 2:03:32.000\n The most successful socialist party in Europe was the German Party. It started around 1870,\n\n2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:38.880\n Marx was still alive. Some of his own family were leaders, Fernand Lassalle and others, his daughters.\n\n2:03:40.960 --> 2:03:44.720\n By the end of the century, it was the second most important party in Germany.\n\n2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:53.840\n Nobody understood it. It was almost as big a shock to the Europeans as was the Russian Revolution\n\n2:03:53.840 --> 2:04:00.800\n in 1917. Here was a political party that was now in every German city, in every German town,\n\n2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:10.080\n powerful and enjoying its rise up. My family is involved in this, I really do know the story.\n\n2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:22.640\n It meant that starting around 1906, 1907, 1908, if you wanted to have any kind of presence\n\n2:04:23.360 --> 2:04:29.360\n in the German working class, you had to use the word socialist. You had to, otherwise they wouldn't\n\n2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:36.560\n pay attention. The other parties called themselves Catholic. Germany is divided, the upper two,\n\n2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:42.000\n the northern two thirds is Protestant, the southern third is Catholic. Munich and Bavaria\n\n2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:47.600\n is Catholic and every other part of Germany basically is Protestant. You could be in the\n\n2:04:47.600 --> 2:04:54.400\n Catholic Party, that was the south, or you could be in various conservative, Prussian and other.\n\n2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:59.920\n But if you wanted to have a presence in the working class, which was growing, in Germany\n\n2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:06.640\n a very powerful capitalist country, expanding like crazy at this time. Germany was the major\n\n2:05:06.640 --> 2:05:12.640\n competitor to Britain for the empire. The United States was coming up too, but it was Germany and\n\n2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:21.280\n US taking over from Britain's empire. So the German working class was it. So anybody who wanted\n\n2:05:21.280 --> 2:05:29.840\n to approach the working class in whatever way had to come to terms and be friendly to socialism.\n\n2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:37.680\n Other parties did this too, just like Hitler. They put the word socialist in their party,\n\n2:05:37.680 --> 2:05:43.600\n but they wanted to make it clear that they weren't anything to do with the Soviet Union\n\n2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:49.920\n or anything to do with Marxism. So they put the word national. Nazi is the first four letters\n\n2:05:49.920 --> 2:05:56.480\n of national, national in German, and the ZI is how you spell national in the German.\n\n2:05:56.480 --> 2:05:58.880\n National socialism, but definitely not communists.\n\n2:05:58.880 --> 2:06:02.640\n That's right. They killed communists. They fought communists in the street.\n\n2:06:03.520 --> 2:06:09.200\n They had pitched battles. They literally threatened each other's existence and their\n\n2:06:09.200 --> 2:06:15.360\n lives. And the first people that he arrested and put in jail were not Jews and gypsies and all the\n\n2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:20.160\n other people he eventually killed. It was communists. They were the number one, and\n\n2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:26.560\n socialists right behind him. Why? Because up until he takes power, January of 1933,\n\n2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:31.600\n that's when Hitler takes power, the last elections, two of them in 1932,\n\n2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:36.720\n the socialists and communists, they vote together, 50% of the vote in Germany.\n\n2:06:36.720 --> 2:06:43.760\n So he appealed to the German manufacturers, the German capitalists, and he said,\n\n2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:50.720\n the communists and socialists are going to win. And you're just the capitalists. You have too\n\n2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:56.080\n few people. You need a mass base, and I'm the only one that can do that.\n\n2:06:56.080 --> 2:06:59.520\n And it was just a populist message that he used.\n\n2:06:59.520 --> 2:07:07.360\n That's right. But it was explicitly done as a deal. The ruling group said to Hindenburg,\n\n2:07:07.360 --> 2:07:11.920\n the old Prussian man who was in charge of the German government at the time,\n\n2:07:11.920 --> 2:07:16.480\n you have to invite Hitler to form a new government. Otherwise, he would never have\n\n2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:22.480\n done it. He had called Hitler nasty names before. The Prussian aristocracy looked down on Hitler\n\n2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:28.720\n as a little funny man with a mustache who was Austrian, wasn't even German. For them,\n\n2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:37.200\n that mattered. So he comes in as the enemy, the smasher of socialism and communism,\n\n2:07:37.200 --> 2:07:43.680\n which he immediately does. Only people who don't know or care about the history\n\n2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:52.080\n pick up on the word. It's like there are people here in the United States who like to say,\n\n2:07:53.680 --> 2:08:00.800\n we are not a democracy, we are a republic, which is like saying, I'm not a banana, I'm a fruit.\n\n2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:07.440\n You have to explain to these people, a banana is a kind of fruit. So you have to explain to people,\n\n2:08:07.440 --> 2:08:14.000\n yes, we're a republic, but we have a commitment to democracy as a way to govern the republic,\n\n2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:18.080\n because to say you're a republic doesn't imply what kind of government you have. You have to\n\n2:08:18.080 --> 2:08:20.160\n go through that with people so they kind of get it.\n\n2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:26.560\n And certain words have power beyond their actual meaning. They're used in communication,\n\n2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:31.920\n whether it's negative, like racist, or positive, like freedom of speech.\n\n2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:33.760\n RL. Or Democrat, with a D.\n\n2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:36.240\n RG. Yeah, and then you use that to mean something.\n\n2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:37.120\n RL. Who knows?\n\n2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:44.400\n RG. Or negative, stop Donnie, stop being a socialist, or whatever that means that's not\n\n2:08:44.400 --> 2:08:50.080\n even used in any kind of philosophical or economic sense. So let's fast forward to today.\n\n2:08:50.080 --> 2:08:50.560\n RL. Right.\n\n2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:52.000\n RG. You mentioned Bernie Sanders.\n\n2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:52.400\n RL. Right.\n\n2:08:52.400 --> 2:08:59.040\n RG. There's another popular figure that represents some ideas of maybe let's call it democratic\n\n2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:03.600\n socialism, and maybe let's try to start to sneak up on a definition of what that could\n\n2:09:03.600 --> 2:09:10.240\n possibly mean, but AOC, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, she's from these parts.\n\n2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:11.120\n RL. Yes, Queens.\n\n2:09:11.120 --> 2:09:21.600\n RG. So maybe if you can comment on Bernie Sanders or AOC, are they open to some ideas in Marxism?\n\n2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.560\n Are they representing those ideas well in both the economic and the political sense?\n\n2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:28.640\n RL. Okay.\n\n2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.440\n RG. Where do I begin?\n\n2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:39.840\n RL. Yeah, the socialist movement predates Marx, was always larger than Marx, and has\n\n2:09:39.840 --> 2:09:44.320\n gone on to develop separately after Marx's death. So...\n\n2:09:44.320 --> 2:09:50.800\n RG. Can we pause on that actually? Is there a nice way to delineate, draw a line between\n\n2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:59.040\n Marxism and socialism? Or if Marxism is kind of a part of socialism, can you speak to like,\n\n2:09:59.760 --> 2:10:04.720\n maybe try to define once again what Marxism is and what socialism is?\n\n2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:16.080\n RL. Right. Marxism is a systematic analysis heavily focused on economics, and as I said\n\n2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:29.120\n earlier, devoted to mostly a critique of capitalism, and that's its strength, how it does that,\n\n2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:36.640\n how it poses the questions, how it analyzes the way capitalism works. That is really the\n\n2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:44.800\n forte of the Marxist tradition. Socialism is a bigger, broader tent within which Marxism\n\n2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:51.280\n figures. It's there so that people who aren't Marxists are nonetheless aware of Marxism,\n\n2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:59.600\n like it more or less, study it more or less. But it's a broader notion that I like to use\n\n2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:07.520\n this sentence to describe. It's a broad idea that we can do better than capitalism, that really\n\n2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:16.800\n there are all kinds of things about capitalism that are not what we as modern citizens of the\n\n2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:23.760\n world think are adequate, that we are in a tradition that goes back to all the people who\n\n2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:27.680\n thought they could do better than slavery, and all the people who thought they could do better\n\n2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:35.120\n than feudalism. We've made progress. Feudalism was a progress over slavery. Capitalism was a\n\n2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:41.840\n progress over both of them. And progress hasn't stopped. And we are the people who, in a variety\n\n2:11:41.840 --> 2:11:51.840\n of ways, want the progress to go further and are not held back by believing that capitalism is\n\n2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:59.680\n somehow the best beyond which we cannot go or even think. We find that to be, in the worst sense of\n\n2:11:59.680 --> 2:12:07.920\n the word, a reactionary way of thinking. And we're that large community. Many of us are not interested\n\n2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:16.080\n in economics all that much. We don't think that's the focal area. We are socialists, for example,\n\n2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:22.400\n because we want to do something to deal with climate change. We think the world is about to\n\n2:12:22.400 --> 2:12:31.600\n kill itself physically, and we want to take steps with other people to stop that, to fix that, etc.,\n\n2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:39.440\n etc. So that's, for me, a kind of difference. It's a little difficult to say because there's no\n\n2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:49.520\n other figure like Marx that has an equal impact, an equal place within the broad socialist\n\n2:12:49.520 --> 2:12:58.560\n tradition. And the only tradition that comes close might be the anarchist tradition. But that's very\n\n2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:05.520\n specialized, and that's a whole other kind of conversation. And whatever you say, the influence\n\n2:13:05.520 --> 2:13:14.160\n of the great anarchist thinkers\u2014Kropotkin, Bakunin, Sorel, and others\u2014still doesn't\n\n2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:21.120\n amount to the impact that Marx and Marxism have had so far. That could change, but I mean, up to\n\n2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:28.880\n this point, that's the\u2014I think that's a way of understanding the relationship.\n\n2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:33.440\n Yeah, that's an interesting thing that some of the ideas within anarchism\u2014and of course,\n\n2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:41.920\n it's one of the more varied disciplines because there's such, maybe by definition, such variety\n\n2:13:41.920 --> 2:13:51.520\n in their thinkers\u2014but they kind of stand for a dismantling of a power center, and that,\n\n2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:56.880\n if not equates, tends to rhyme with some of the ideas of socialism.\n\n2:13:56.880 --> 2:13:57.520\n Absolutely.\n\n2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:04.080\n There's a whole train of thought in socialist ideas and in Marxist ideas\n\n2:14:04.080 --> 2:14:12.400\n that uses the phrase, quote, the withering away of the state. That's a quotation from Lenin.\n\n2:14:14.880 --> 2:14:22.000\n People should understand that's a quotation from Lenin. And it was made by Lenin. In other words,\n\n2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:28.240\n Lenin was saying, that's a good thing. That's something we stand for. We want to create the\n\n2:14:28.240 --> 2:14:34.400\n conditions under which there is a\u2014because you remember the communists, or whatever,\n\n2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:39.520\n they weren't called that at first in Russia before the revolution. They were just socialists.\n\n2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:44.560\n They were hunted down and persecuted by the government left and right. They had no love\n\n2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:51.440\n for the government. The government was their literal, everyday enemy. And being critical\n\n2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:57.600\n of government didn't just mean this particular government, but of the whole\u2014being a Marxist,\n\n2:14:57.600 --> 2:15:03.040\n you always ask the questions of the social constitution of whatever it is you're struggling\n\n2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:08.960\n against. So there was this interest, why is the state so important? Especially because if you\n\n2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:14.560\n understand feudalism, particularly early feudalism, it didn't have powerful states.\n\n2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.800\n One of Lenin's greatest books is called The Economic History of Russia, and it goes back\n\n2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:26.720\n centuries. It's a huge book, three or four inches thick, and I'm one of the few people who've read\n\n2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:35.520\n it. And he's very good about the absence of a strong central government in many parts of\n\n2:15:35.520 --> 2:15:41.360\n feudalism, including inside Russia, but also in other parts of Europe. The development of a powerful\n\n2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:48.400\n central state comes towards the end of feudalism as it is desperate to hold on, which ought to be\n\n2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:54.880\n suggestive that maybe the turn to powerful governments here in the United States or in Europe\n\n2:15:54.880 --> 2:16:03.440\n and Europe is maybe also because this system is exhausted and can't go on and has to marshal every\n\n2:16:03.440 --> 2:16:12.160\n last bit of power it can, not to be lost in history. It would be interesting to see what\n\n2:16:12.160 --> 2:16:18.080\n the Soviet Union would look like if Lenin never died. A lot of people have asked that question\n\n2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:24.080\n over the years, a lot of people. There's Stalin sliding in in the middle of the night,\n\n2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:32.000\n erasing the withering away of the state part. So just to return briefly back to AOC and Bernie\n\n2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.840\n Sanders, what are your thoughts about these modern political figures that represent some of these\n\n2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:41.840\n ideas, and they sometimes refer to those ideas as democratic socialism? The crucial thing about\n\n2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:48.400\n Bernie and about AOC, and this is particularly true about Bernie, because AOC is much younger\n\n2:16:48.400 --> 2:16:59.280\n and Bernie's an older man. Bernie, being roughly my age, has been around formatively as a student,\n\n2:16:59.280 --> 2:17:05.040\n as an activist, and then coming up through the ranks in Burlington, Vermont as a mayor and all\n\n2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:12.720\n the rest. He lived through what, for lack of a better term, I would call Cold War America.\n\n2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:19.200\n And the taboo in Cold War America, running from around 1945, 6 to the present, I mean,\n\n2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:29.920\n really never stopped, was a Manichean worldview. The United States is good, it defines democracy,\n\n2:17:29.920 --> 2:17:35.920\n and the Soviet Union is awful, it defines whatever the opposite of democracy should be called.\n\n2:17:35.920 --> 2:17:47.440\n Good here, evil there. It was taken so far that even among the ranks of academic individuals,\n\n2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:56.160\n it was impossible to have a conversation. I mean, I can't tell, just make it very personal,\n\n2:17:56.160 --> 2:18:02.800\n the number of times I would raise my hand in my classes at Harvard or Stanford or Yale,\n\n2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:08.640\n and I would ask a question that had something to do with Marxism,\n\n2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:13.440\n because I was studying it on my own. There were no courses to teach this to me,\n\n2:18:13.440 --> 2:18:18.160\n except by people who trashed it, other than that, and I didn't want that.\n\n2:18:20.160 --> 2:18:26.640\n So I would ask a question, and I would see in the faces of my teachers, both those I didn't\n\n2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:32.640\n much care for and those who were good teachers that I liked, fear. It was just fear. They didn't\n\n2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:37.920\n want to go there. They didn't want to answer my question. And after a while, I got to know some\n\n2:18:37.920 --> 2:18:42.560\n of them, and I found out why. Because you don't know how the rest of the class is going to\n\n2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:47.680\n understand this. Either they would have to say, I don't know, which would be the honest truth for\n\n2:18:47.680 --> 2:18:52.400\n many of them, but a professor does not want to say in a classroom, I don't know, that's just\n\n2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:59.600\n not cool. Or they'd have to, if they knew, they'd have to say something that indicated they didn't\n\n2:18:59.600 --> 2:19:05.360\n know really much, and they weren't going to do that. Or they would know something, and maybe\n\n2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:12.160\n that would be because they were interested. They did not want the rest of the students to begin to\n\n2:19:12.160 --> 2:19:20.400\n say, oh, you know, Professor Smith, you know, he's interested. This is not good for your career. You\n\n2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:25.520\n don't know how this is going to play out. Who's going to say what to whom? And I could see in\n\n2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:31.680\n their faces what I later learned, because they told me, come to my office hours. We're in the\n\n2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:40.800\n office. We can talk about it. But that's how bad it was. Is it not still? Pretty much. In my field,\n\n2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:46.000\n the great so called debate, I mean, I find it boring, but the great debate for my colleagues\n\n2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:52.640\n is between what's called neoclassical economics and Keynesian economics. Neoclassical, the\n\n2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:58.800\n government should stay out of the economy. Let's say fair or liberalism. And the Keynesian saying,\n\n2:19:58.800 --> 2:20:04.240\n no, you crazy neoclassical, if you do that, you'll have Great Depressions, and the system will\n\n2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:10.880\n collapse. You need the government to come in to solve the problems, to fix the weaknesses. And\n\n2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:15.600\n they hate each other, and they throw each other out of their jobs. One of the very few things that\n\n2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:22.800\n they can do together that they agree on is keeping people like me out. That they can find common\n\n2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:34.000\n ground to do. So I had to learn it all on my own. Why am I telling you this? Because this taboo means\n\n2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:43.280\n that all of the complicated developments within Marxism and within socialism of the post World\n\n2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:52.480\n War II period, the vast bulk of all of that is unknown, not just to the average American person,\n\n2:20:52.480 --> 2:20:58.160\n but to the average American academic, to the average American who thinks of himself or herself\n\n2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:05.680\n as an intellectual. I mean, I have had to spend ridiculous amounts of my time explaining Soviet\n\n2:21:05.680 --> 2:21:13.440\n history. They have no idea. Or saying there's this man Luk\u00e1cs, a Hungarian Marxist, he really had\n\n2:21:13.440 --> 2:21:20.800\n interest in, or to explain that Gramsci was not a great literary critic. He was head of the\n\n2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:28.240\n Communist Party of Italy for most of his adult life. What does that mean? You like Gramsci as a\n\n2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:35.440\n literary critic, but they didn't even know. They don't even know. It's been erased. It's\n\n2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:41.600\n a little bit like stories I've heard about Trotsky and his influence kind of erased in the Soviet\n\n2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:48.240\n Union because he obviously fell out of favor. And so somehow all of his writings, many of which are\n\n2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:55.440\n very interesting and complicated, anyway. So what you're going to have in this country is a slow\n\n2:21:56.400 --> 2:22:04.800\n awakening of socialism from a long hibernation called the Cold War. I never expected, to be very\n\n2:22:04.800 --> 2:22:10.240\n honest with you, that I would live to see it. I knew it would come, because these things always do,\n\n2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:18.240\n but I didn't expect to see it. So I have been surprised, as have a lot of us, that when it\n\n2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:26.960\n starts to happen, it happens fast. So you see Bernie as an early sign of the awakening from\n\n2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:32.720\n the Cold War to accept the idea of socialism. Bernie was always a socialist. We all knew.\n\n2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:40.240\n And everybody who paid attention, he denied it. But 2016, he makes a decision, momentous,\n\n2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:46.320\n to run for president. He's just a senator from Vermont. Vermont is one of the smallest\n\n2:22:46.320 --> 2:22:51.280\n states in the Union. People who live in Vermont love to tell you that there are more cows than\n\n2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:57.920\n people in Vermont, et cetera, et cetera. So here from this little state, this elderly gentleman\n\n2:22:57.920 --> 2:23:03.760\n with a New York City accent runs for office and says, I'm a socialist. And when they attack him,\n\n2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:09.920\n he doesn't run away. I'm a socialist. I'm a socialist. Now, he had been. It wasn't a secret\n\n2:23:09.920 --> 2:23:15.920\n that suddenly got out. But the great question\u2014and I don't mind telling you, because I went to the\n\n2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:21.680\n right schools. I know a lot of people. You know, Janet Yellen was my classmate at Yale,\n\n2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:26.960\n and stuff like that. So I was speaking with a high official of the Democratic Party,\n\n2:23:26.960 --> 2:23:30.480\n and I said, well, what do you think about Bernie entering the race?\n\n2:23:31.280 --> 2:23:37.600\n Makes no difference. He doesn't get 1% of the vote. Right? He was wrong. They had no idea\n\n2:23:37.600 --> 2:23:42.960\n what was coming. But the truth is, I didn't either. It wasn't just that he didn't get it.\n\n2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:46.960\n I thought his 1% was probably right. So we were both wrong.\n\n2:23:46.960 --> 2:23:51.120\n Yeah, change can happen fast. Do you think AOC might be president one day?\n\n2:23:51.120 --> 2:24:01.120\n Yeah. Possible. Possible. But two things. Number one, it's fast. Number two,\n\n2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:11.280\n it's going to go in the following direction, I would guess. You begin with the most moderate,\n\n2:24:12.240 --> 2:24:18.160\n calm, nonconfrontational socialism you can imagine.\n\n2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:19.680\n So not AOC or Bernie.\n\n2:24:19.680 --> 2:24:23.280\n No, no. They are not confrontational, in my judgment.\n\n2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:26.960\n In terms of the ideas of socialism. I mean, they're both very feisty.\n\n2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:30.320\n They're feisty personally, but not ideologically.\n\n2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:40.560\n Bernie is also, in honest moments, and they both really are pretty honest folks,\n\n2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:47.840\n at least in my experience. In honest moments, Bernie will tell you that what he advocates\n\n2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:55.760\n as democratic socialism is pretty much what FDR was in the 1930s. It was a kind of popular\n\n2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:02.960\n government, tax the rich a lot more than you do now to provide a lot more support for the\n\n2:25:02.960 --> 2:25:08.880\n working class than you do now. That's not a fundamental change. That's what he means\n\n2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:15.680\n by socialism. When he talks about it and he's asked for examples, he mentions Denmark a lot.\n\n2:25:15.680 --> 2:25:23.600\n Okay, that's consistent. That's the softest kind of socialism, and that's where we're going to\n\n2:25:23.600 --> 2:25:29.200\n start in a country coming out of hibernation. Pretty soon, it's already happening, there'll\n\n2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:35.520\n be people who need and want to go further in the direction of socialism than Bernie and AOC are\n\n2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:43.360\n comfortable with. You can already see the shoots of it now. AOC voted, together with most of the\n\n2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:49.760\n others, to support the money for Ukraine. Okay, a lot of people in the socialist movement do not\n\n2:25:49.760 --> 2:25:56.880\n support that. I don't know exactly how that's going to work out, but that should give people\n\n2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:01.360\n an idea. There are disagreements, and they're going to fester, and they're going to grow.\n\n2:26:03.040 --> 2:26:08.800\n So people in the socialist sphere don't support money from the United States in the large amounts\n\n2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:13.920\n that it is being sent to Ukraine. Is it because it's fundamentally the military, industrial\n\n2:26:13.920 --> 2:26:19.840\n complex is a capitalist institution kind of thing? No, there are some people for whom that's the\n\n2:26:19.840 --> 2:26:28.000\n issue. Then there are people for whom it's guns and butter, and why are we over there when we have\n\n2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.320\n such needs at home that are being neglected? And then there are people who, well, go back to what\n\n2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:40.720\n we talked about at the beginning, who are more like Lenin and Debs. This is a fight between\n\n2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:48.800\n Western capitalism and Russian oligarchs and wannabe oligarchs in Ukraine, and what are we\n\n2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:55.680\n doing here? We have to insist that these forces sit down at the bargaining table and negotiate\n\n2:26:55.680 --> 2:27:00.400\n a settlement, don't kill large numbers of Ukraine. I mean, everybody's willing to fight to the last\n\n2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:06.240\n Ukrainian is a little strange here. What are you doing? You're supposed to be in favor of peace,\n\n2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:11.840\n you know, and for the United States, which just finished invading and occupying Afghanistan and\n\n2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:16.480\n Iraq, to be against another country invading. I mean, who in the world is going to take this\n\n2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:23.120\n seriously? This is crazy. You know, I invade, it's good, and you invade, it's terrible. What?\n\n2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:30.160\n You know, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? What's going on here? All of these\n\n2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:35.680\n questions are being active\u2014by the way, not just by socialists, by lots of other people too\u2014inside\n\n2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:42.080\n the Democratic Party and also inside the Republican Party. You watch that Tucker Carlson or people\n\n2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:47.920\n like that, they are against the stuff in Ukraine. They don't want the money spent there, they don't\n\n2:27:47.920 --> 2:27:53.600\n want the weapons sent there, they don't like the whole policy, and Trump wobble.\n\n2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:58.720\n So Mr. Biden's policy has got all kinds of critics on the left and the right,\n\n2:27:58.720 --> 2:28:05.440\n and every day that this thing lasts, these criticisms get bigger. Anyway, the point is that\n\n2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:16.240\n AOC and Bernie should be, I think, evaluated as the early shoots after a long winter of Cold War\n\n2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:25.760\n isolation from the whole\u2014you know, when I explain to people the contribution made, for example,\n\n2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:32.080\n to modern Marxism\u2014I'll give you an example\u2014by the French philosopher Louis Althusser. I don't\n\n2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:38.720\n know if the name means anything to you. Okay. He was the rector of the \u00c9cole Normale\n\n2:28:38.720 --> 2:28:45.680\n Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris. That's the equivalent. Imagine in this country if there were a university\n\n2:28:45.680 --> 2:28:53.600\n that combined Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and MIT. It would be the university. Well, the \u00c9cole Normale\n\n2:28:53.600 --> 2:29:00.800\n in France, in Paris, is the\u2014he was a tenured professor who became the rector. The rector is\n\n2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:06.160\n like the president of the university, an active member of the French Communist Party most of his\n\n2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:12.240\n adult life. That was possible in France during the Cold War. That was unthinkable in this country.\n\n2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:21.200\n You could not in a million years, right? So Althusser, as a philosopher, tried to bring\n\n2:29:21.200 --> 2:29:29.760\n a version of postmodernism into Marxism, with enormous impact all over the world, where he\n\n2:29:29.760 --> 2:29:35.680\n traveled\u2014not just in Europe, all over, right? So if you want to look him up, I'll spell it out for\n\n2:29:35.680 --> 2:29:46.880\n you. Sure. A.L.T.H.U.S.S.E.R. Louis. The Louis is spelled L.O.U.I.S. Louis Althusser. Look him up.\n\n2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:53.200\n You'll see tons of stuff. By the way, MIT Press is a major publisher, if I remember, of his works\n\n2:29:53.200 --> 2:29:59.600\n in English. By the way, the textbook I wrote in economics, in case you're ever interested,\n\n2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:05.440\n was also published by the MIT Press. And the title? Contending Economic Theories.\n\n2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:12.320\n Neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. That's at MIT. Marxian. Yeah, that's right. And by the way,\n\n2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:18.160\n when we think\u2014I don't know if there's an interesting distinction between Marxian economics\n\n2:30:18.160 --> 2:30:26.480\n and Marxist\u2014I suppose Marxism is the umbrella of everything that's\u2014 I only use it because\n\n2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:35.200\n Marxist I use as a noun. A person is a Marxist. Marxian I use as an adjective to qualify. But\n\n2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:39.760\n I don't mean some great difference. There's a last point I would like to make about\n\n2:30:39.760 --> 2:30:49.440\n AOC and Bernie that's also general. I'm a historian, too, and I know that the transition\n\n2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:56.320\n out of feudalism in Europe to capitalism was a transition that took centuries and that occurred\n\n2:30:56.320 --> 2:31:02.800\n in fits and starts. So, for example, a feudal manor would start to disintegrate. Serfs would\n\n2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:09.040\n run away. They'd run into a town. How would they live in the town? They had no land anymore because\n\n2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:15.440\n they had run away from the feudal manor. A deal was struck without the people involved in the deal\n\n2:31:15.440 --> 2:31:22.720\n understanding what they were doing. A merchant would say to one of these serfs, I'm in the\n\n2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:27.280\n business of buying and then reselling stuff and living off the difference, but, you know,\n\n2:31:27.280 --> 2:31:33.120\n I could make more money if I produce some of this stuff myself rather than buy it from somebody\n\n2:31:33.120 --> 2:31:38.400\n else. So I'm going to make you a deal. I'm going to give you money once a week. I'll give you\n\n2:31:38.400 --> 2:31:43.600\n money, what we would later call a wage, and you come here and under my supervision you make this\n\n2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:50.400\n crap that I'm going to then sell and this all works out. In other words, there were efforts,\n\n2:31:51.520 --> 2:31:57.680\n unconscious, not self aware, to go out of feudalism to a new system.\n\n2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:04.960\n Some of them lasted a few days and then fell apart. Some of them lasted weeks or months or\n\n2:32:04.960 --> 2:32:14.960\n years, but it took a long time before the conditions were ready for a kind of a general\n\n2:32:14.960 --> 2:32:21.760\n switch and once that was done it grew on itself and became the global capitalist system we have\n\n2:32:21.760 --> 2:32:28.800\n today. That's the only model we have. So for me that's what I see when I look at socialism.\n\n2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:38.080\n I see the Paris Commune was an event, an attempt. It lasted a few weeks. I see Russia, that was an\n\n2:32:38.080 --> 2:32:44.480\n attempt, lasted 70 years. Then I see, and you know, fill in the blank, I see these are all early\n\n2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:52.400\n experiments. These are all you learn things to do, learn things never to do again. The good, the bad,\n\n2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:58.640\n what do you build on? How do you learn? And that's what the socialist and Marxist tradition\n\n2:32:58.640 --> 2:33:04.800\n when it's serious, that's what it does. So in your ideas sort of capitalism was a significant\n\n2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:12.320\n improvement over the feudalism and we are coming to an age and over slavery and we're coming to\n\n2:33:12.320 --> 2:33:18.720\n an age where capitalism will die out and make, it's not that capitalism is somehow fundamentally\n\n2:33:18.720 --> 2:33:24.400\n broken. It's better than the things that came before but there's going to be things yet better\n\n2:33:24.400 --> 2:33:31.760\n and they will be grounded in the ideas of Marxism and socialism. Is there just to linger briefly on\n\n2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:41.600\n the way Marxism is used as a term on Twitter. There's something called, I'm sorry if I'm using\n\n2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:51.120\n the terms incorrectly, but cultural Marxism. Criticisms of universities being infiltrated\n\n2:33:51.120 --> 2:33:59.360\n by cultural Marxists. I'm not exactly sure. I don't pay close enough attention, but it's woke.\n\n2:34:00.560 --> 2:34:08.080\n There's a kind of woke ideology that I'm not exactly sure. What is the fundamental text?\n\n2:34:09.360 --> 2:34:16.960\n Who's the Karl Marx of wokeness? All I do know is that there's certain characteristics\n\n2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:25.440\n of woke ideology, which is hard lines are drawn between the good guys and the bad guys.\n\n2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:35.120\n And basically everyone is a bad guy except the people that are very loudly nonstop saying that\n\n2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:47.200\n they're the good guy. And that applies for racism, for sexism, for gender politics,\n\n2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:54.960\n identity politics, all that kind of stuff. Is there any parallels between Marxian economics\n\n2:34:54.960 --> 2:35:00.160\n and Marxist ideology and whatever is being called Marxism on Twitter?\n\n2:35:00.160 --> 2:35:05.440\n WOLFF No, not much. One of the consequences\n\n2:35:05.440 --> 2:35:13.120\n of the taboo after World War II is that Marxism, like socialism and communism, become swear words.\n\n2:35:13.120 --> 2:35:20.480\n It's like calling somebody, well, I won't use bad language, but using a four letter word to describe\n\n2:35:20.480 --> 2:35:26.720\n somebody. So instead of calling them this or that, you call them a Marxist. In many circles,\n\n2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:32.880\n this is even worse than whatever other adjective you might have used, but it doesn't have a\n\n2:35:32.880 --> 2:35:41.680\n particular meaning that I can assess. The closest you get is your little list. It is somebody who is\n\n2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:50.640\n concerned about race and sex and sexual orientation, gender and all of those things,\n\n2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:59.360\n and wants there to be transgendered bathrooms. And I don't like any of these people, so I slap\n\n2:35:59.360 --> 2:36:07.120\n the word Marxism or the phrase cultural Marxism, because it isn't Marxism about getting more money\n\n2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:14.320\n or controlling the industry or all those things that dimly we know Marxists somehow are concerned\n\n2:36:14.320 --> 2:36:19.120\n about. So this is odd, since they don't know much about Marxism. I've always been interested\n\n2:36:19.120 --> 2:36:25.360\n in culture. I mean, Lukacs, the man I mentioned to you before, Gramsci, that's what they're famous\n\n2:36:25.360 --> 2:36:32.560\n for, the analysis of what Marxism particularly has to say about culture. Gramsci writes at great\n\n2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:39.200\n length about the Catholic Church, about theater and painting in Italy and on and on. I mean,\n\n2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:43.680\n this is just ignorance talking. They don't know anything about that. They wouldn't know what the\n\n2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:51.120\n names are. It's a label that summarizes, kind of a shorthand, I'm against all of this. I don't\n\n2:36:51.120 --> 2:36:57.360\n want to be told that there's ugly racism in this country, and it always has been, or sexism, or\n\n2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:06.480\n phobia against gay people, whatever it is that's agitating them. Marxism or socialism,\n\n2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:13.760\n I mean, it's just like socialism is the post office. It is a mentality. Well, but I don't\n\n2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:20.640\n blame them. I mean, it's childish. It's mean spirited. But it comes out of the fact no one\n\n2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:26.800\n ever sat them down and said, you know, here is this tradition. It's got these kinds of things\n\n2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:33.280\n that people kind of share and these big differences. Look, an intelligent society,\n\n2:37:33.280 --> 2:37:40.560\n which this country is, could have and should have done that. It was fear and a kind of terror that\n\n2:37:40.560 --> 2:37:45.520\n made them behave in the way they did, and we're now seeing it. Having said that, there is such a\n\n2:37:45.520 --> 2:37:58.320\n thing as cultural Marxism. What that is is simply those Marxists who devoted themselves to analyzing\n\n2:37:58.320 --> 2:38:07.600\n how it is that a particular culture is, on the one hand, shaped by capitalism and, on the other hand,\n\n2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:14.560\n it becomes a condition for capitalism to survive and grow. In other words, how do we analyze the\n\n2:38:14.560 --> 2:38:24.880\n interaction between the class struggle on the job and attitude towards sexuality, or movements in\n\n2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:32.400\n music, or whatever else culture. And there are Georg Luk\u00e1cs, this Hungarian, great name in there,\n\n2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:38.640\n the greatest of all the names, Antonio Gramsci. And a modern name, just died a couple years ago,\n\n2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:46.480\n a British intellectual named Stuart Hall, H A L L. If I were teaching, which I have done,\n\n2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:55.280\n a course in cultural Marxism, those would be three major blocks on the syllabus. I would give you\n\n2:38:55.280 --> 2:39:02.560\n articles and books to read of their stuff, because it has been so seminal in provoking many, many\n\n2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:07.040\n others. So there is something to be said and understood about the kind of culture that\n\n2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:13.360\n capitalism creates and the kind of culture that enables capitalism. Yes, and Marxists are\n\n2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:18.320\n particularly those who like to look at that interaction. In other words, they are interested\n\n2:39:18.320 --> 2:39:24.080\n in how capitalism shapes culture and how culture shapes capitalism. There is another name, I\n\n2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:34.720\n forgot. Stuart Hall is British, Gramsci is Italian, Luk\u00e1cs is Hungarian. The German is Walter Benjamin,\n\n2:39:34.720 --> 2:39:44.240\n B E N J A M I N. He was a member of the Frankfurt School, which is a huge school of Marxism that\n\n2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:49.600\n developed in Frankfurt, Germany, and that has a lot of people, many of whom were interested in\n\n2:39:49.600 --> 2:39:56.560\n cultural questions. It was a bit of a reaction against the narrow Marxism that was so focused on\n\n2:39:56.560 --> 2:40:02.080\n economics and politics. There were people who said, you're leaving out very important parts\n\n2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:08.480\n of modern society that are shaping the economy as much as they are shaped by it. And it was that\n\n2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:15.680\n impetus to open Marxism to be more inclusive in what it deemed to be important to understand\n\n2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:20.560\n that this cult, and they call themselves cultural Marxists, but they had a completely different\n\n2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:27.120\n meaning from this. This is just, you know, just bad mouthing, that's all.\n\n2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:33.600\n LW Let me ask a more personal question. So for most of the 20th century, no not most,\n\n2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:39.280\n but a large many decades in the United States as a consequence of the Cold War and before,\n\n2:40:39.840 --> 2:40:46.800\n being a Marxist is one of the worst things you could be. Have you had dark periods in your own\n\n2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:54.400\n life where you've gone to some dark places in your mind where it was difficult, like self doubt,\n\n2:40:54.400 --> 2:41:00.400\n difficult to know, like what the hell am I doing? When you're surrounded by colleagues and people,\n\n2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:06.480\n you said prestigious universities, both personal interest of career, but also as a human being,\n\n2:41:06.480 --> 2:41:14.400\n when everybody, you know, kind of looks at you funny because you're studying this thing. Did\n\n2:41:14.400 --> 2:41:16.160\n that ever get you real low?\n\n2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:21.680\n RL No. I know people who had exactly what you said. I mean, your question's perfectly reasonable.\n\n2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.920\n If I were you, I'd be asking me that question too.\n\n2:41:23.920 --> 2:41:26.400\n LW And what's wrong with you?\n\n2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:33.440\n RL Nothing wrong with the question. And here's the honest truth. I don't know how anomalous I am. I\n\n2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:41.360\n really don't. But the truth is, no. I have, if my wife was sitting here, she'd tell you what she\n\n2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:47.760\n tells me, which is I have been tremendously lucky in my life, which is true. But then again,\n\n2:41:47.760 --> 2:41:58.320\n luck never is the only explanation for things. That's part of it. What can I say? I didn't choose\n\n2:41:58.320 --> 2:42:03.440\n the time of my birth. I didn't choose the communities in which I grew up or the schools I\n\n2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:04.800\n attended or anything else.\n\n2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:09.440\n RL No, but the fact that there was no courses or extensive courses on Marxian economics.\n\n2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.880\n RL But you know, again, I'm Hegel. On the one hand, I was denied good instruction.\n\n2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:21.600\n On the other hand, I had to go out and learn it on my own. And the motivation when you do that is\n\n2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:27.520\n very different. I'm not the student who sits there with my notebook, taking notes of what the great\n\n2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:35.440\n professor says and reading the text and getting ready for the exam. I don't have an exam. I'm\n\n2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:45.520\n doing something slightly risque, you know, kind of romantically different and oppositional. I was\n\n2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:52.960\n able to find always one or two professors that I could talk to outside of the classroom situation,\n\n2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:59.440\n other students who felt enough similar to me that we could get together and read these books and\n\n2:42:59.440 --> 2:43:06.960\n talk about them. I had a number of really fortuitous people who were kind to me and gave me\n\n2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:14.560\n of their time and their effort to teach me along the way. And I've had the benefit that because I\n\n2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:21.920\n went to all these fancy schools, I do know a lot of people who are in high places in this culture.\n\n2:43:21.920 --> 2:43:27.840\n And when I have been put in difficult positions, I often wave my pedicure at them and say,\n\n2:43:27.840 --> 2:43:34.400\n I often wave my pedigree and it works like garlic with the devil. They back away. They back away.\n\n2:43:35.600 --> 2:43:40.480\n Because Americans are very deferential to that kind of academic prestige.\n\n2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:46.160\n But there's a personal psychological thing that seems that you have never been shaken by this. You\n\n2:43:46.160 --> 2:43:53.600\n have just naturally somebody who just has perseverance.\n\n2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:57.440\n WOLFF Well, I would put it, I understand what you're saying, but I would put it a little\n\n2:43:57.440 --> 2:44:08.080\n differently. I think capitalism struck me early on in my life as not that great a system and nothing\n\n2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:20.640\n has happened to change my mind. In other words, the development just kept giving me more and more\n\n2:44:20.640 --> 2:44:29.200\n evidence. And I must say over the last 10 years, what's really changed? The last 10 years. I mean,\n\n2:44:30.000 --> 2:44:35.040\n I can't describe to you how big that change is. And that may be more important than anything else\n\n2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:44.160\n we've discussed. Up until 10 years ago, I would do a public event, an interview on television or\n\n2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:52.080\n a radio thing or give a talk at some conference or something. Once every two or three months,\n\n2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:58.640\n I'd be invited and I would do it, like academics often do. I now do two to three to four\n\n2:44:59.280 --> 2:45:09.680\n interviews every day. So, there's a hunger. How is there hunger? And I want to be honest with you.\n\n2:45:09.680 --> 2:45:15.440\n WOLFF As I say at the end of some of my talks, I allow there to be a kind of a pregnant pause\n\n2:45:16.160 --> 2:45:22.640\n from the podium that I lean into the microphone and I say, with as much smile as I can get,\n\n2:45:23.200 --> 2:45:32.320\n I'm having the time of my life. And that's the truth. That's the truth. I never expected, look,\n\n2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:37.200\n I'm used to teaching a classroom, a seminar for graduate students with eight or nine or 10\n\n2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:44.080\n students or a regular undergraduate class with 30 or an occasional introductory course\n\n2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:51.520\n with a few hundred. I've done all of those things many times. But an audience, you know,\n\n2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:58.080\n that I can count in the hundreds of thousands on YouTube and all of that, no, that's new.\n\n2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:07.600\n LESTER Is there advice you can give, given your bold and nonstandard career and life, advice you\n\n2:46:07.600 --> 2:46:14.160\n can give to high school students, college students about how to have a career like that, or maybe\n\n2:46:14.160 --> 2:46:24.640\n how to have a career or a life they can be proud of? WOLFF Yeah. First of all, my advice is go for\n\n2:46:24.640 --> 2:46:31.520\n it. The conditions for doing that now are infinitely better than they were when I had to do it.\n\n2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:40.800\n And I could do it and I'm happy I did it. Becoming a teacher is one of those decisions I made\n\n2:46:40.800 --> 2:46:48.800\n that I've never regretted. And I've never regretted being a critic of this society,\n\n2:46:48.800 --> 2:46:58.880\n ever. I find it edifying. I find it, I mean, the gratitude people express to me for helping them\n\n2:46:58.880 --> 2:47:04.400\n see kind of what's going on is unbelievably encouraging. I mean, what can I tell you?\n\n2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:08.720\n LESTER So that fills you, that fills you with joy. Pointing out that the Emperor has no clothes\n\n2:47:08.720 --> 2:47:14.720\n fills you. That's a life not just important. WOLFF And you know why? It's because most of the people\n\n2:47:14.720 --> 2:47:21.280\n who say something like that to me are people who, if they had the vocabulary, and some of them do,\n\n2:47:21.920 --> 2:47:28.800\n would say, you know, I thought I was seeing through that outfit that I was wearing. I thought\n\n2:47:28.800 --> 2:47:35.920\n it and they did. And all they needed was a little extra this information or that factoid or this\n\n2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:43.920\n logic. And they have that. And I remember having that too. When I had a teacher who made something\n\n2:47:43.920 --> 2:47:50.640\n clear that had been murky, I always felt gratitude. And now I get that gratitude a good bit.\n\n2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:57.760\n And yes, it is enormously gratifying. And I'm not sure I could get it any other way.\n\n2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:09.040\n I have learned and I'm walking proof that being a critic of society and doing it systematically\n\n2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:15.360\n and sharing it with other people makes for a very good life. A very good life.\n\n2:48:15.360 --> 2:48:23.520\n LESTER Speaking of which, however, one other aspect of human nature is that life comes to an end.\n\n2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:27.680\n Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of it?\n\n2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:36.400\n WOLFF Afraid of it? No. Think about it? Yes. Yes. I'm not afraid. I've always thought,\n\n2:48:36.400 --> 2:48:41.360\n you know, death is hard for the people that are left when you're dead. It's not going to bother\n\n2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:49.200\n you very much. So I worry more about my wife. I'm very attached to my wife. I might mention to you,\n\n2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:58.800\n I got married when I was 23 years old. That's my wife to this day. So I'm lucky because if you get\n\n2:48:58.800 --> 2:49:07.840\n married to anybody in age 23, it's either luck or it isn't. LESTER What role has love played\n\n2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:09.120\n in your life? WOLFF Enormous.\n\n2:49:11.360 --> 2:49:17.280\n Because I came from a family, you know, if your family is political refugees, which mine were,\n\n2:49:17.280 --> 2:49:24.240\n who had to interrupt their lives, moved to another continent, learn another language,\n\n2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:35.200\n find another life, income and job. The disruption goes real deep for any refugee. So my mother and\n\n2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:48.240\n father were both refugees. They met as refugees. So I had to, in a way, make it up to them. I had\n\n2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:56.560\n to be, I was the first child of their younger sister, but the first child. And, you know,\n\n2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:02.320\n there's a lot of psychological pressure on you if you're in that situation. Nobody means you harm,\n\n2:50:02.320 --> 2:50:10.640\n but you've got to do what they couldn't, what was shut off to them in a way they want you to do.\n\n2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:17.200\n It's the closest they're going to get to what they had hoped. And my parents were both university\n\n2:50:17.200 --> 2:50:23.280\n students. My father was a lawyer. My mother had to leave the university to run for her life.\n\n2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:32.400\n So I had to perform. You know, I went to high school here in the United States. I had to get\n\n2:50:32.400 --> 2:50:36.720\n all A's. I had to be on the football team. I had to play the violin in the orchestra. I had to\n\n2:50:36.720 --> 2:50:44.480\n do all these because everything had to be achieved. So I'm an achievement crazy person that\n\n2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:51.440\n way. But that's functional in this dysfunctional society. But on top of that, that's an achievement\n\n2:50:52.320 --> 2:50:58.160\n within the game of this particular society. But then love seems to be a thing that's greater\n\n2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:02.880\n than that game. Is that something that made you a better person? Oh, God, yes. How is it\n\n2:51:04.320 --> 2:51:10.160\n made you a better Marxian and a better human? Everything. Because my wife, by profession,\n\n2:51:10.160 --> 2:51:17.840\n is a psychotherapist. Excellent. I love it. And I needed it. And so I married it. I didn't know\n\n2:51:17.840 --> 2:51:24.400\n what I was doing at the time, but I think as I look back on it, that was more than a little what\n\n2:51:24.400 --> 2:51:32.560\n was going on. And she has tutored me all my life about a whole range of aspects of life that my\n\n2:51:32.560 --> 2:51:42.480\n family never talked about, never dealt with, never at least explicitly engaged in any of that.\n\n2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:48.560\n Because it was all about survival. The immigrant challenge is survival. Survive. And you're so busy\n\n2:51:50.320 --> 2:51:55.280\n that you tell yourself you can't do that. Of course you can. And there are other reasons\n\n2:51:55.280 --> 2:52:01.280\n why you're not going to look at those problems. But the survival is so urgent that you can fool\n\n2:52:01.280 --> 2:52:08.880\n yourself this way. And my parents did that. One last question. What's the meaning of life,\n\n2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:19.280\n Richard Wolff? Why are we here? I will quote you, Mr. Marx. Let's go. Life is struggle. And for me,\n\n2:52:20.400 --> 2:52:29.920\n I have found that to be true. That the struggle, whether it is to build a relationship with your\n\n2:52:29.920 --> 2:52:36.880\n child, I have two children, whether it's to build one with your spouse, whether it's to understand\n\n2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:44.800\n a complicated argument and simplify it so that you can share the pleasure of understanding this\n\n2:52:44.800 --> 2:52:53.440\n relationship to a student or to an audience. It's a struggle to do all those things. But that\n\n2:52:53.440 --> 2:53:02.640\n network of struggles, that makes life interesting, intriguing, and satisfying.\n\n2:53:02.640 --> 2:53:04.000\n And meaningful.\n\n2:53:04.000 --> 2:53:05.040\n Very meaningful.\n\n2:53:05.040 --> 2:53:09.520\n And that latter thing, I got to say, you do masterfully. You're one of the great communicators\n\n2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:14.640\n and educators out there today. And it's a huge honor that you would sit with me for so many hours.\n\n2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:15.440\n Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n\n2:53:15.440 --> 2:53:19.680\n This is awesome. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Wolff.\n\n2:53:19.680 --> 2:53:23.440\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:27.280\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Karl Marx.\n\n2:53:28.240 --> 2:53:35.760\n The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.\n\n2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:51.440\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
