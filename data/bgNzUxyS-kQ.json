  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.960\n The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis,\n\n00:02.960 --> 00:05.000\n his fourth time on the podcast.\n\n00:05.000 --> 00:06.880\n He's a professor at MIT\n\n00:06.880 --> 00:10.440\n and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group.\n\n00:10.440 --> 00:14.440\n Since this is episode number 142,\n\n00:14.440 --> 00:16.680\n and 42, as we all know,\n\n00:16.680 --> 00:18.840\n is the answer to the ultimate question of life,\n\n00:18.840 --> 00:20.440\n the universe, and everything,\n\n00:20.440 --> 00:23.640\n according to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\n\n00:23.640 --> 00:26.760\n we decided to talk about this unanswerable question\n\n00:26.760 --> 00:28.120\n of the meaning of life\n\n00:28.120 --> 00:32.000\n in whatever way we two descendants of apes could muster,\n\n00:32.000 --> 00:37.000\n from biology, psychology, to metaphysics, and to music.\n\n00:37.640 --> 00:39.400\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n00:39.400 --> 00:42.080\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:42.080 --> 00:44.160\n Thanks to Grammarly,\n\n00:44.160 --> 00:47.440\n which is a service for checking spelling, grammar,\n\n00:47.440 --> 00:49.880\n sentence structure, and readability,\n\n00:49.880 --> 00:52.520\n Athletic Greens, the all in one drink\n\n00:52.520 --> 00:54.080\n that I start every day with\n\n00:54.080 --> 00:56.280\n to cover all my nutritional bases,\n\n00:56.280 --> 01:00.400\n and Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n01:00.400 --> 01:02.440\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n01:02.440 --> 01:05.680\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n01:05.680 --> 01:06.520\n As a side note,\n\n01:06.520 --> 01:09.280\n let me say that the opening 40 minutes of the conversation\n\n01:09.280 --> 01:11.480\n are all about the many songs\n\n01:11.480 --> 01:14.160\n that formed the soundtrack to the journey\n\n01:14.160 --> 01:15.840\n of Manolis's life.\n\n01:15.840 --> 01:18.000\n It was a happy accident for me to discover\n\n01:18.000 --> 01:20.440\n yet another dimension of depth\n\n01:20.440 --> 01:22.720\n to the fascinating mind of Manolis.\n\n01:22.720 --> 01:24.840\n I include links to YouTube versions\n\n01:24.840 --> 01:28.200\n of many of the songs we mentioned in the description,\n\n01:28.200 --> 01:30.600\n and overlay lyrics on occasion.\n\n01:30.600 --> 01:31.960\n But if you're just listening to this\n\n01:31.960 --> 01:34.720\n without listening to the songs or watching the video,\n\n01:34.720 --> 01:37.040\n I hope you still might enjoy, as I did,\n\n01:37.040 --> 01:39.600\n the passion that Manolis has for music,\n\n01:39.600 --> 01:43.080\n his singing of the little excerpts from the songs,\n\n01:43.080 --> 01:46.240\n and in general, the meaning we discuss\n\n01:46.240 --> 01:49.200\n that we pull from the different songs.\n\n01:49.200 --> 01:50.760\n If music is not your thing,\n\n01:50.760 --> 01:53.960\n I do give timestamps to the less musical\n\n01:53.960 --> 01:56.720\n and more philosophical parts of the conversation.\n\n01:56.720 --> 01:59.160\n I hope you enjoy this little experiment\n\n01:59.160 --> 02:02.960\n and conversation about music and life.\n\n02:02.960 --> 02:05.280\n If you do, please subscribe on YouTube,\n\n02:05.280 -->

Friedman.\n\n02:13.320 --> 02:17.360\n And now, here's my conversation with Manolis Callas.\n\n02:18.320 --> 02:21.120\n You mentioned Leonard Cohen and the song Hallelujah\n\n02:21.120 --> 02:22.800\n as a beautiful song.\n\n02:22.800 --> 02:26.120\n So what are the three songs\n\n02:26.120 --> 02:29.160\n you draw the most meaning from about life?\n\n02:29.160 --> 02:31.320\n Don't get me started.\n\n02:31.320 --> 02:34.680\n So there's really countless songs that have marked me,\n\n02:34.680 --> 02:38.520\n that have sort of shaped me in periods of joy\n\n02:38.520 --> 02:40.280\n and in periods of sadness.\n\n02:40.280 --> 02:43.040\n My son likes to joke that I have a song\n\n02:43.040 --> 02:44.880\n for every sentence he will say,\n\n02:44.880 --> 02:46.320\n because very often I will break into a song\n\n02:46.320 --> 02:47.720\n with a sentence he'll say.\n\n02:48.760 --> 02:50.520\n My wife calls me the radio\n\n02:50.520 --> 02:53.440\n because I can sort of recite hundreds of songs\n\n02:53.440 --> 02:54.560\n that have really shaped me.\n\n02:54.560 --> 02:56.800\n So it's gonna be very hard to just pick a few.\n\n02:56.800 --> 02:57.800\n So I'm just gonna tell you a little bit\n\n02:57.800 --> 03:01.640\n about my song transition as I've grown up.\n\n03:01.640 --> 03:03.720\n In Greece, it was very much about,\n\n03:03.720 --> 03:06.880\n as I told you before, the misery, the poverty,\n\n03:06.880 --> 03:09.000\n but also overcoming adversity.\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:11.920\n So some of the songs that have really shaped me\n\n03:11.920 --> 03:13.880\n are Charis Alexiou, for example,\n\n03:13.880 --> 03:16.400\n is one of my favorite singers in Greece.\n\n03:16.400 --> 03:19.600\n And then there's also really just old traditional songs\n\n03:19.600 --> 03:21.120\n that my parents used to listen to.\n\n03:21.120 --> 03:25.480\n Like one of them is Ani Moun Plousios,\n\n03:25.480 --> 03:28.840\n which is basically, oh, if I was rich.\n\n03:28.840 --> 03:32.200\n And the song is painting this beautiful picture\n\n03:32.200 --> 03:34.960\n about all the noises that you hear in the neighborhood,\n\n03:34.960 --> 03:37.560\n his poor neighborhood, the train going by,\n\n03:37.560 --> 03:39.920\n the priest walking to the church\n\n03:39.920 --> 03:43.040\n and the kids crying next door and all of that.\n\n03:43.040 --> 03:44.640\n And he says, with all of that,\n\n03:44.640 --> 03:47.520\n I'm having trouble falling asleep and dreaming.\n\n03:47.520 --> 03:52.400\n If I was rich, and then he was breaking to that.\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:55.680\n So it's this juxtaposition between the spirit\n\n03:55.680 --> 03:59.920\n and the sublime and then the physical and the harsh reality.\n\n03:59.920 --> 04:03.320\n It's just not having troubles, not being miserable.\n\n04:03.320 --> 04:05.160\n So basically rich to him just means\n\n04:05.160 --> 04:06.560\n out of my misery, basically.\n\n04:08.120 --> 04:10.200\n And then also being able to travel,\n\n04:10.200 --> 04:12.240\n being able to sort of be the captain of a ship\n\n04:12.240 --> 04:14.200\n and see the world and stuff like that.\n\n04:14.200 --> 04:16.160\n So it's just such beautiful imagery.\n\n04:16.160 --> 04:18.280\n So many of the Greek songs, just like the poetry\n\n04:18.280 --> 04:21.400\n we talked about, they acknowledge the cruelty,\n\n04:21.400 --> 04:24.440\n the difficulty of life, but are longing for a better life.\n\n04:24.440 --> 04:25.280\n That's exactly right.\n\n04:25.280 --> 04:26.960\n And another one is Ftokhologia.\n\n04:26.960 --> 04:29.760\n And this is one of those songs that has like a fast\n\n04:29.760 --> 04:33.600\n and joyful half and a slow and sad half.\n\n04:33.600 --> 04:35.760\n And it goes back and forth between them.\n\n04:35.760 --> 04:36.600\n And it's like,\n\n04:36.600 --> 04:41.200\n Ftokhologia, jefse na kathemou dragoouzi.\n\n04:41.200 --> 04:45.800\n So poor, you know, basically it's the state of being poor.\n\n04:45.800 --> 04:50.160\n I don't even know if there's a word for that in English.\n\n04:50.160 --> 04:54.000\n And then fast part is ta kerya sou megalosan\n\n04:54.000 --> 04:56.200\n ke ponesan ke matosan.\n\n04:56.200 --> 04:59.120\n So, and then it's like, oh, you know,\n\n04:59.120 --> 05:02.680\n basically like the state of being poor and misery,\n\n05:02.680 --> 05:05.600\n you know, for you, I write all my songs, et cetera.\n\n05:05.600 --> 05:09.000\n And then the fast part is in your arms,\n\n05:09.000 --> 05:14.000\n grew up and suffered and, you know, stood up and,\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:18.360\n you know, rose, men with clear vision.\n\n05:18.360 --> 05:21.760\n This whole concept of taking on the world\n\n05:21.760 --> 05:25.040\n with nothing to lose because you've seen the worst of it.\n\n05:25.040 --> 05:29.920\n This imagery of psilaki parizopoula harastakorizopoula.\n\n05:29.920 --> 05:34.080\n So it's describing the young men as cypress trees.\n\n05:34.080 --> 05:35.840\n And that's probably one of my earliest exposure\n\n05:35.840 --> 05:38.080\n to a metaphor, to sort of, you know,\n\n05:38.080 --> 05:40.040\n this very rich imagery.\n\n05:40.040 --> 05:42.600\n And I love about the fact that I was reading a story\n\n05:42.600 --> 05:44.760\n to my kids the other day and it was dark.\n\n05:44.760 --> 05:47.000\n And my daughter who's six is like,\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:48.480\n oh, can I please see the pictures?\n\n05:48.480 --> 05:53.480\n And Jonathan, who's eight, so my daughter Cleo is like,\n\n05:53.560 --> 05:54.640\n oh, let's look at the pictures.\n\n05:54.640 --> 05:57.480\n And my son Jonathan, he's like, but Cleo,\n\n05:57.480 --> 06:00.200\n if you look at the pictures, it's just an image.\n\n06:00.200 --> 06:03.280\n If you just close your eyes and listen, it's a video.\n\n06:03.280 --> 06:05.400\n That's brilliant.\n\n06:05.400 --> 06:06.800\n It's beautiful.\n\n06:06.800 --> 06:08.960\n And he's basically showing just how much more\n\n06:08.960 --> 06:12.240\n the human imagination has besides just a few images\n\n06:12.240 --> 06:14.120\n that, you know, the book will give you.\n\n06:14.120 --> 06:15.680\n And then another one, oh gosh,\n\n06:15.680 --> 06:17.960\n this one is really like miserable.\n\n06:17.960 --> 06:22.960\n It's called Sto Perigiali, To Krifo.\n\n06:23.200 --> 06:28.200\n And it's basically describing how vigorously\n\n06:28.480 --> 06:31.680\n we took on our life and we pushed hard\n\n06:31.680 --> 06:33.760\n towards a direction that we then realized\n\n06:33.760 --> 06:34.680\n was the wrong one.\n\n06:36.960 --> 06:39.680\n And again, these songs give you so much perspective.\n\n06:39.680 --> 06:41.000\n There's no songs like that in English\n\n06:41.000 --> 06:44.200\n that will basically sort of just smack you in the face\n\n06:44.200 --> 06:47.440\n about sort of the passion and the force and the drive.\n\n06:47.440 --> 06:51.160\n And then it turns out, we just followed the wrong life.\n\n06:51.160 --> 06:52.360\n And it's like, wow.\n\n06:54.480 --> 06:55.320\n Okay, so that was you.\n\n06:55.320 --> 06:57.120\n All right, so that's like before 12.\n\n06:57.120 --> 07:02.120\n So growing up in sort of this horrendously miserable\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:07.040\n sort of view of romanticism, of suffering.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:10.640\n So then my preteen years is like, you know,\n\n07:10.640 --> 07:12.840\n learning English through songs.\n\n07:12.840 --> 07:13.720\n So basically, you know,\n\n07:13.720 --> 07:15.560\n listening to all the American pop songs\n\n07:15.560 --> 07:17.880\n and then memorizing them vocally\n\n07:17.880 --> 07:19.680\n before I even knew what they meant.\n\n07:19.680 --> 07:23.000\n So, you know, Madonna and Michael Jackson\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:25.280\n and all of these sort of really popular songs\n\n07:25.280 --> 07:27.760\n and, you know, George Michael and just songs\n\n07:27.760 --> 07:30.800\n that I would just listen to the radio and repeat vocally.\n\n07:30.800 --> 07:32.480\n And eventually as I started learning English,\n\n07:32.480 --> 07:34.520\n I was like, oh wow, this thing I've been repeating,\n\n07:34.520 --> 07:36.040\n I now understand what it means.\n\n07:36.040 --> 07:37.880\n Without relistening it to it,\n\n07:37.880 --> 07:40.200\n but just with re repeating it, it was like, oh.\n\n07:41.520 --> 07:44.120\n Again, Michael Jackson's Man in the Mirror\n\n07:44.120 --> 07:47.480\n is teaching you that it's your responsibility\n\n07:47.480 --> 07:49.400\n to just improve yourself.\n\n07:49.400 --> 07:51.160\n You know, if you wanna make the world a better place,\n\n07:51.160 --> 07:52.960\n take a look at yourself and make the change.\n\n07:52.960 --> 07:55.160\n This whole concept of, again, I mean,\n\n07:55.160 --> 07:57.000\n all of these songs, you can listen to them shallowly\n\n07:57.000 --> 07:59.040\n or you can just listen to them and say,\n\n07:59.040 --> 08:00.760\n oh, there's deeper meaning here.\n\n08:00.760 --> 08:04.240\n And I think there's a certain philosophy of song\n\n08:04.240 --> 08:06.320\n as a way of touching the psyche.\n\n08:06.320 --> 08:08.400\n So if you look at regions of the brain,\n\n08:08.400 --> 08:10.160\n people have lost their language ability\n\n08:10.160 --> 08:12.320\n because they have an accident in that region of the brain\n\n08:12.320 --> 08:16.040\n can actually sing because it's exactly\n\n08:16.040 --> 08:18.400\n the symmetric region of the brain.\n\n08:18.400 --> 08:19.680\n And that again, teaches you so much\n\n08:19.680 --> 08:23.960\n about language evolution and sort of the duality\n\n08:23.960 --> 08:28.360\n of musicality and, you know, rhythmic patterns\n\n08:28.360 --> 08:31.160\n and eventually language.\n\n08:31.160 --> 08:34.280\n Do you have a sense of why songs developed?\n\n08:34.280 --> 08:36.200\n You're kind of suggesting that it's possible\n\n08:36.200 --> 08:39.240\n that there is something important\n\n08:39.240 --> 08:43.160\n about our connection with song and with music\n\n08:43.160 --> 08:46.080\n on the level of the importance of language.\n\n08:46.080 --> 08:47.280\n Is it possible?\n\n08:47.280 --> 08:48.560\n It's not just possible.\n\n08:48.560 --> 08:51.200\n In my view, language comes after music.\n\n08:51.200 --> 08:52.520\n Language comes after song.\n\n08:52.520 --> 08:53.360\n No, seriously.\n\n08:53.360 --> 08:56.720\n Like basically, my view of human cognitive evolution\n\n08:56.720 --> 08:58.800\n is rituals.\n\n08:58.800 --> 09:01.360\n If you look at many early cultures,\n\n09:01.360 --> 09:04.560\n there's rituals around every stage of life.\n\n09:04.560 --> 09:09.560\n There's organized dance performances around mating.\n\n09:10.000 --> 09:11.440\n And if you look at mate selection,\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:14.080\n I mean, that's an evolutionary drive right there.\n\n09:14.080 --> 09:16.160\n So basically, if you're not able to string together\n\n09:16.160 --> 09:19.920\n a complex dance as a bird, you don't get a mate.\n\n09:19.920 --> 09:23.240\n And that actually forms this development\n\n09:23.240 --> 09:25.320\n for many song learning birds.\n\n09:25.320 --> 09:27.800\n Not every bird knows how to sing.\n\n09:27.800 --> 09:31.040\n And not every bird knows how to learn a complicated song.\n\n09:31.040 --> 09:33.880\n So basically, there's birds that simply have\n\n09:33.880 --> 09:36.120\n the same few tunes that they know how to play.\n\n09:36.120 --> 09:39.080\n And a lot of that is inherent and genetically encoded.\n\n09:39.080 --> 09:42.600\n And others are birds that learn how to sing.\n\n09:42.600 --> 09:47.320\n And if you look at a lot of these exotic birds of paradise\n\n09:47.320 --> 09:48.280\n and stuff like that,\n\n09:48.280 --> 09:51.320\n the mating rituals that they have are enormously amazing.\n\n09:51.320 --> 09:55.120\n And I think human mating rituals of ancient tribes\n\n09:55.120 --> 09:56.840\n are not very far off from that.\n\n09:56.840 --> 10:01.840\n And in my view, the sequential formation of these movements\n\n10:01.960 --> 10:06.080\n is a prelude to the cognitive capabilities\n\n10:06.080 --> 10:08.360\n that ultimately enable language.\n\n10:08.360 --> 10:10.600\n It is fascinating to think that that's\n\n10:10.600 --> 10:13.440\n not just an accidental precursor to intelligence.\n\n10:13.440 --> 10:16.040\n Yeah, sexually selected.\n\n10:16.040 --> 10:19.560\n Well, it's sexually selected and it's a prerequisite.\n\n10:19.560 --> 10:20.400\n Yeah.\n\n10:20.400 --> 10:21.760\n It's like, it's required for intelligence.\n\n10:21.760 --> 10:24.960\n And even as language has now developed,\n\n10:24.960 --> 10:28.760\n I think the artistic expression is needed,\n\n10:28.760 --> 10:31.280\n like badly needed by our brain.\n\n10:31.280 --> 10:34.920\n So it's not just that, oh, our brain can kind of,\n\n10:34.920 --> 10:36.840\n you know, take a break and go do that stuff.\n\n10:36.840 --> 10:39.200\n No, I mean, you know, I don't know if you remember\n\n10:39.200 --> 10:40.800\n that scene from, oh gosh,\n\n10:40.800 --> 10:43.560\n where's that Jack Nicholson movie in New Hampshire.\n\n10:44.960 --> 10:47.880\n All work and no play, make Jack a dull boy.\n\n10:47.880 --> 10:49.080\n A dull boy.\n\n10:49.080 --> 10:49.920\n The Shining.\n\n10:49.920 --> 10:51.560\n The Shining.\n\n10:51.560 --> 10:54.880\n So there's this amazing scene where he's constantly\n\n10:54.880 --> 10:57.200\n trying to concentrate and what's coming out\n\n10:57.200 --> 10:58.920\n of the typewriter is just gibberish.\n\n10:58.920 --> 11:01.640\n And I have that image as well when I'm working.\n\n11:01.640 --> 11:04.240\n And I'm like, no, basically all of these crazy,\n\n11:04.240 --> 11:06.560\n you know, huge number of hobbies that I have,\n\n11:06.560 --> 11:09.560\n they're not just tolerated by my work.\n\n11:09.560 --> 11:12.000\n They're required by my work.\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:13.960\n This ability of sort of stretching your brain\n\n11:13.960 --> 11:15.640\n in all these different directions\n\n11:15.640 --> 11:20.160\n is connecting your emotional self and your cognitive self.\n\n11:20.160 --> 11:22.480\n And that's a prerequisite to being able\n\n11:22.480 --> 11:24.720\n to be cognitively capable.\n\n11:24.720 --> 11:25.560\n At least in my view.\n\n11:25.560 --> 11:28.840\n Yeah, I wonder if the world without art and music,\n\n11:28.840 --> 11:30.640\n you're just making me realize that perhaps\n\n11:30.640 --> 11:34.720\n that world would be not just devoid of fun things\n\n11:34.720 --> 11:38.120\n to look at or listen to, but devoid of all the other stuff.\n\n11:38.120 --> 11:41.160\n All the bridges and rockets and science.\n\n11:41.160 --> 11:42.400\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n11:42.400 --> 11:45.320\n Creativity is not disconnected from art.\n\n11:45.320 --> 11:47.520\n And you know, my kids, I mean, you know,\n\n11:47.520 --> 11:50.520\n I could be doing the full math treatment to them.\n\n11:50.520 --> 11:53.320\n No, they play the piano and they play the violin\n\n11:53.320 --> 11:54.320\n and they play sports.\n\n11:54.320 --> 11:58.160\n I mean, this whole, you know, sort of movement\n\n11:58.160 --> 12:01.840\n and going through mazes and playing tennis\n\n12:01.840 --> 12:05.240\n and, you know, playing soccer and avoiding obstacles\n\n12:05.240 --> 12:06.400\n and all of that,\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:09.120\n that forms your three dimensional view of the world.\n\n12:09.120 --> 12:11.000\n Being able to actually move and run and play\n\n12:11.000 --> 12:14.600\n in three dimensions is extremely important for math,\n\n12:14.600 --> 12:17.880\n for, you know, stringing together complicated concepts.\n\n12:17.880 --> 12:21.440\n It's the same underlying cognitive machinery\n\n12:21.440 --> 12:26.440\n that is used for navigating mazes and for navigating theorems\n\n12:27.360 --> 12:28.760\n and sort of solving equations.\n\n12:28.760 --> 12:31.760\n So I can't, you know, I can't have a conversation\n\n12:31.760 --> 12:33.720\n with my students without, you know,\n\n12:33.720 --> 12:35.360\n sort of either using my hands\n\n12:35.360 --> 12:39.400\n or opening the whiteboard in Zoom\n\n12:39.400 --> 12:41.280\n and just constantly drawing.\n\n12:41.280 --> 12:43.800\n Or, you know, back when we had in person meetings,\n\n12:43.800 --> 12:44.640\n just the whiteboard on my own.\n\n12:44.640 --> 12:47.240\n The whiteboard, yeah, that's fascinating to think about.\n\n12:47.240 --> 12:49.440\n So that's Michael Jackson, man,\n\n12:49.440 --> 12:52.200\n Mirror, Careless Whisper with George Michael,\n\n12:52.200 --> 12:53.040\n which is a song I like.\n\n12:53.040 --> 12:54.440\n You can say Careless Whisper.\n\n12:54.440 --> 12:55.480\n I mean, I didn't say that.\n\n12:55.480 --> 12:56.320\n I like that one.\n\n12:56.320 --> 12:57.960\n That's too popular for you.\n\n12:57.960 --> 12:59.720\n I had recorded, no, no, no,\n\n12:59.720 --> 13:01.560\n that it's an amazing song for me.\n\n13:01.560 --> 13:03.480\n I had recorded a small part of it\n\n13:03.480 --> 13:05.720\n as it's played at the tail end of the radio.\n\n13:05.720 --> 13:09.080\n And I had a tape where I only had part of that song\n\n13:09.080 --> 13:11.880\n and I just played it over and over and over again,\n\n13:11.880 --> 13:13.680\n just so beautiful.\n\n13:13.680 --> 13:15.040\n It's so heartbreaking.\n\n13:15.040 --> 13:16.200\n That song is almost Greek.\n\n13:16.200 --> 13:17.040\n It's so heartbreaking.\n\n13:17.040 --> 13:19.040\n I know, and George Michael is Greek.\n\n13:19.040 --> 13:19.880\n Is he Greek?\n\n13:19.880 --> 13:20.760\n He's Greek, of course.\n\n13:20.760 --> 13:22.680\n George Michaelides, I mean, he's Greek.\n\n13:22.680 --> 13:23.520\n Yeah.\n\n13:23.520 --> 13:24.760\n I did not know this.\n\n13:24.760 --> 13:25.600\n Now you know.\n\n13:25.600 --> 13:30.280\n I'm so sorry to offend you so deeply not knowing this.\n\n13:30.280 --> 13:31.120\n So, okay, so what's...\n\n13:31.120 --> 13:32.080\n So anyway, so we're moving to France\n\n13:32.080 --> 13:33.000\n when I'm 12 years old.\n\n13:33.000 --> 13:36.120\n And now I'm getting into the songs of Gainsbourg.\n\n13:36.120 --> 13:39.520\n So Gainsbourg is this incredible French composer.\n\n13:39.520 --> 13:42.000\n He is always seen on stage,\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.320\n like not even pretending to try to please,\n\n13:44.320 --> 13:45.280\n just like with his cigarette,\n\n13:45.280 --> 13:47.480\n just like rrrr mumbling his songs.\n\n13:47.480 --> 13:49.840\n But the lyrics are unbelievable.\n\n13:49.840 --> 13:53.040\n Like basically entire sentences will rhyme.\n\n13:53.040 --> 13:56.680\n He will say the same thing twice and you're like, whoa.\n\n13:58.000 --> 14:00.720\n And in fact, another, speaking of Greek,\n\n14:00.720 --> 14:03.080\n a French Greek, George Mustaky,\n\n14:03.080 --> 14:05.240\n this song is just magnificent.\n\n14:05.240 --> 14:10.040\n Avec ma gueule de m\u00e9t\u00e8que, de juif errant, de patre grecque.\n\n14:10.040 --> 14:15.040\n So with my face of m\u00e9t\u00e8que is actually a Greek word.\n\n14:15.040 --> 14:17.840\n A Greek word, it's a French word for a Greek word.\n\n14:17.840 --> 14:20.080\n But met comes from meta,\n\n14:20.080 --> 14:23.360\n and then ec from Ikea, from ecology, which means home.\n\n14:23.360 --> 14:26.640\n So m\u00e9t\u00e8que is someone who has changed homes for a migrant.\n\n14:26.640 --> 14:30.040\n So with my face of a migrant, and you'll love this one.\n\n14:30.040 --> 14:32.320\n De juif errant, de patre grecque,\n\n14:32.320 --> 14:37.320\n of a meandering Jew, of Greek pastor.\n\n14:39.600 --> 14:42.040\n So again, the Russian Greek,\n\n14:42.040 --> 14:45.480\n the Jewish Orthodox connection, so.\n\n14:45.480 --> 14:46.920\n Aime mes cheveux au quatre vents,\n\n14:46.920 --> 14:48.720\n with my hair in the four wings.\n\n14:48.720 --> 14:53.160\n Avec mes yeux tous d\u00e9lav\u00e9s qui me donnent l\u00e9reux de r\u00eaver.\n\n14:53.160 --> 14:55.960\n Avec, with my eyes that are all washed out,\n\n14:55.960 --> 14:58.800\n who give me the pretense of dreaming,\n\n14:58.800 --> 15:01.240\n but who don't dream that much anymore.\n\n15:01.240 --> 15:05.200\n With my hands of thief, of musician,\n\n15:05.200 --> 15:08.960\n and who have stolen so many gardens.\n\n15:08.960 --> 15:11.280\n With my mouth that has drunk,\n\n15:11.280 --> 15:14.520\n that has kissed, and that has bitten,\n\n15:14.520 --> 15:16.920\n without ever pleasing its hunger.\n\n15:17.960 --> 15:22.360\n With my skin that has been rubbed\n\n15:23.280 --> 15:25.640\n in the sun of all the summers,\n\n15:25.640 --> 15:28.000\n and anything that was wearing a skirt.\n\n15:29.040 --> 15:32.160\n With my heart, and then you have to listen to this verse,\n\n15:32.160 --> 15:33.240\n it's so beautiful.\n\n15:33.240 --> 15:38.240\n Avec mon coeur qui a su faire souffrir autant qu il a souffert.\n\n15:38.240 --> 15:39.920\n Qui a su faire.\n\n15:39.920 --> 15:44.580\n With my heart that knew how to make suffer\n\n15:44.580 --> 15:46.560\n as much as it suffered,\n\n15:46.560 --> 15:50.360\n but was able to, that knew how to make,\n\n15:50.360 --> 15:53.160\n in French it's actually su faire,\n\n15:53.160 --> 15:54.760\n that knew how to make.\n\n15:54.760 --> 15:57.840\n Qui a su faire souffrir autant qu il a souffert.\n\n15:57.840 --> 15:59.480\n Verses that span the whole thing.\n\n15:59.480 --> 16:00.800\n It's just beautiful.\n\n16:00.800 --> 16:02.920\n Do you know, on a small tangent,\n\n16:02.920 --> 16:05.760\n do you know Jacques Brel?\n\n16:05.760 --> 16:07.080\n Of course, of course.\n\n16:07.080 --> 16:10.240\n And then Ne Me Kite Pas, those songs.\n\n16:10.240 --> 16:12.560\n That song gets me every time.\n\n16:12.560 --> 16:14.800\n So there's a cover of that song\n\n16:14.800 --> 16:17.120\n by one of my favorite female artists.\n\n16:17.120 --> 16:18.400\n Not Nina Simone.\n\n16:18.400 --> 16:19.760\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n16:19.760 --> 16:20.600\n Modern?\n\n16:20.600 --> 16:21.760\n Carol Emerald.\n\n16:21.760 --> 16:24.760\n She's from Amsterdam.\n\n16:24.760 --> 16:28.200\n And she has a version of Ne Me Kite Pas\n\n16:28.200 --> 16:30.600\n where she's actually added some English lyrics.\n\n16:31.480 --> 16:33.100\n And it's really beautiful.\n\n16:33.100 --> 16:35.280\n But again, Ne Me Kite Pas is just so,\n\n16:35.280 --> 16:38.360\n I mean it's, you know, the promises,\n\n16:38.360 --> 16:42.000\n the volcanoes that will restart.\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:43.440\n It's just so beautiful.\n\n16:43.440 --> 16:44.280\n And.\n\n16:44.280 --> 16:47.080\n I love, there's not many songs\n\n16:47.080 --> 16:51.560\n that show such depth of desperation\n\n16:51.560 --> 16:52.880\n for another human being.\n\n16:52.880 --> 16:54.040\n That's so powerful.\n\n16:54.040 --> 16:54.880\n I apologize.\n\n16:54.880 --> 16:58.000\n Je t offrirai des perles de pluie\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:01.040\n venant de pays o\u00f9 il ne pleut pas.\n\n17:01.040 --> 17:02.460\n And then high school.\n\n17:02.460 --> 17:03.840\n Now I'm starting to learn English.\n\n17:03.840 --> 17:05.040\n So I moved to New York.\n\n17:05.040 --> 17:07.720\n So Sting's Englishman in New York.\n\n17:07.720 --> 17:08.560\n Yeah.\n\n17:08.560 --> 17:09.920\n Magnificent song.\n\n17:09.920 --> 17:14.280\n And again, there's if manners maggoth manners someone said\n\n17:14.280 --> 17:16.840\n then he's the hero of the day.\n\n17:16.840 --> 17:20.060\n It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile.\n\n17:20.060 --> 17:23.600\n Be yourself no matter what they say.\n\n17:23.600 --> 17:27.740\n And then takes more than combat gear to make a man.\n\n17:27.740 --> 17:30.640\n Takes more than a license for a gun.\n\n17:30.640 --> 17:34.120\n Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can.\n\n17:34.120 --> 17:37.440\n A gentleman will walk but never run.\n\n17:37.440 --> 17:39.880\n It's again, you're talking about songs\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:41.200\n that teach you how to live.\n\n17:41.200 --> 17:42.600\n I mean, this is one of them.\n\n17:42.600 --> 17:46.360\n Basically says, it's not the combat gear that makes a man.\n\n17:46.360 --> 17:49.500\n Where's the part where he says, there you go.\n\n17:49.500 --> 17:53.800\n Gentleness so brighty are rare in this society.\n\n17:53.800 --> 17:56.800\n At night a candle's brighter than the sun.\n\n17:56.800 --> 17:57.640\n So beautiful.\n\n17:57.640 --> 18:00.520\n He basically says, well, you just might be the only one.\n\n18:00.520 --> 18:03.720\n Modesty propriety can lead to notoriety.\n\n18:03.720 --> 18:05.880\n You could end up as the only one.\n\n18:05.880 --> 18:08.100\n It's, it basically tells you,\n\n18:08.100 --> 18:09.840\n you don't have to be like the others.\n\n18:09.840 --> 18:14.000\n Be yourself, show kindness, show generosity.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:18.260\n Don't, you know, don't let that anger get to you.\n\n18:18.260 --> 18:19.800\n You know, the song Fragile.\n\n18:19.800 --> 18:22.920\n How fragile we are, how fragile we are.\n\n18:22.920 --> 18:26.080\n So again, as in Greece, I didn't even know what that meant.\n\n18:26.080 --> 18:28.840\n How fragile we are, but the song was so beautiful.\n\n18:28.840 --> 18:29.960\n And then eventually I learned English\n\n18:29.960 --> 18:31.800\n and I actually understand the lyrics.\n\n18:31.800 --> 18:36.800\n And the song is actually written after the Contras\n\n18:36.920 --> 18:39.680\n murdered Ben Linder in 1987.\n\n18:39.680 --> 18:43.120\n And the US eventually turned against supporting\n\n18:43.120 --> 18:44.480\n these guerrillas.\n\n18:44.480 --> 18:46.160\n And it was just a political song,\n\n18:46.160 --> 18:49.300\n but so such a realization that you can't win\n\n18:49.300 --> 18:51.400\n with violence basically.\n\n18:51.400 --> 18:55.360\n And that song starts with the most beautiful poetry.\n\n18:55.360 --> 19:00.360\n So if blood will flow when flesh and steel are one,\n\n19:00.360 --> 19:04.640\n drying in the color of the evening sun,\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:08.320\n tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away,\n\n19:08.320 --> 19:11.800\n but something in our minds will always stain.\n\n19:11.800 --> 19:14.320\n Perhaps this final act was meant\n\n19:14.320 --> 19:16.760\n to clinch a lifetime's argument\n\n19:16.760 --> 19:19.080\n that nothing comes through violence\n\n19:19.080 --> 19:21.400\n and nothing ever could.\n\n19:21.400 --> 19:25.040\n For all those born beneath an angry star,\n\n19:25.040 --> 19:28.360\n lest we forget how fragile we are.\n\n19:28.360 --> 19:31.080\n Damn, right?\n\n19:31.080 --> 19:33.680\n I mean, that's poetry.\n\n19:33.680 --> 19:35.680\n It was beautiful.\n\n19:35.680 --> 19:37.440\n And he's using the English language\n\n19:37.440 --> 19:42.020\n is just such a refined way with deep meanings,\n\n19:42.020 --> 19:45.640\n but also words that rhyme just so beautifully\n\n19:45.640 --> 19:49.800\n and evocations of when flesh and steel are one.\n\n19:50.720 --> 19:53.360\n I mean, it's just mind boggling.\n\n19:53.360 --> 19:55.880\n And then of course the refrain that everybody remembers\n\n19:55.880 --> 20:00.000\n is on and on the rain will fall, et cetera.\n\n20:00.000 --> 20:00.840\n But like this beginning.\n\n20:00.840 --> 20:01.920\n Tears from a star, wow.\n\n20:01.920 --> 20:03.440\n Yeah.\n\n20:03.440 --> 20:06.840\n And again, tears from a star, how fragile we are.\n\n20:06.840 --> 20:10.160\n I mean, just these rhymes are just flowing so naturally.\n\n20:10.160 --> 20:12.800\n Something, it seems that more meaning comes\n\n20:12.800 --> 20:16.000\n when there's a rhythm that, I don't know what that is.\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:18.160\n That probably connects to exactly what you were saying.\n\n20:18.160 --> 20:19.240\n And if you pay close attention,\n\n20:19.240 --> 20:22.480\n you will notice that the more obvious words\n\n20:22.480 --> 20:25.120\n sometimes are the second verse\n\n20:25.120 --> 20:28.120\n and the less obvious are often the first verse\n\n20:28.120 --> 20:31.680\n because it makes the second verse flow much more naturally\n\n20:31.680 --> 20:33.760\n because otherwise it feels contrived.\n\n20:33.760 --> 20:36.480\n Oh, you went and found this like unusual word.\n\n20:36.480 --> 20:39.800\n In Dark Moments, the whole album of Pink Floyd\n\n20:39.800 --> 20:42.600\n and the movie just marked me enormously\n\n20:42.600 --> 20:45.200\n as a teenager, just the wall.\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:47.700\n And there's one song that never actually made it\n\n20:47.700 --> 20:49.840\n into the album that's only there in the movie\n\n20:49.840 --> 20:51.920\n about when the tigers broke free\n\n20:51.920 --> 20:55.040\n and the tigers are the tanks of the Germans.\n\n20:55.040 --> 20:58.120\n And it just describes, again, this vivid imagery.\n\n20:58.120 --> 21:02.960\n It was just before dawn, one miserable morning in Black 44\n\n21:02.960 --> 21:05.760\n when the forward commander was told to sit tight\n\n21:05.760 --> 21:08.360\n when he asked that his men be withdrawn.\n\n21:08.360 --> 21:10.400\n And the generals gave thanks\n\n21:10.400 --> 21:15.400\n as the other ranks held back the enemy tanks for a while.\n\n21:16.040 --> 21:19.520\n And the Anzio bridgehead was held\n\n21:19.520 --> 21:24.520\n for the price of a few hundred ordinary lives.\n\n21:24.520 --> 21:26.960\n So that's a theme that keeps coming back in Pink Floyd\n\n21:26.960 --> 21:28.760\n with Us Versus Them.\n\n21:28.760 --> 21:32.080\n Us and them, God only knows\n\n21:32.080 --> 21:36.200\n that's not what we would choose to do.\n\n21:36.200 --> 21:39.440\n For work he cried from the rear\n\n21:39.440 --> 21:43.960\n and the front rows died from another song.\n\n21:43.960 --> 21:46.240\n It's like this whole concept of Us Versus Them.\n\n21:46.240 --> 21:48.560\n And there's that theme of Us Versus Them again\n\n21:48.560 --> 21:52.800\n where the child is discovering how his father died\n\n21:52.800 --> 21:55.800\n when he finds an old and a found it one day\n\n21:55.800 --> 21:58.360\n in a drawer of old photographs hidden away.\n\n21:58.360 --> 22:01.400\n And my eyes still grow damp to remember\n\n22:01.400 --> 22:05.080\n his majesty's sign with his own rubber stamp.\n\n22:05.080 --> 22:08.480\n So it's so ironic because it seems the way\n\n22:08.480 --> 22:09.960\n that he's writing it that he's not crying\n\n22:09.960 --> 22:11.440\n because his father was lost.\n\n22:11.440 --> 22:15.080\n He's crying because kind old King George\n\n22:15.080 --> 22:17.920\n took the time to actually write mother a note\n\n22:17.920 --> 22:19.920\n about the fact that his father died.\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:23.200\n It's so ironic because it basically says\n\n22:23.200 --> 22:26.720\n we are just ordinary men and of course we're disposable.\n\n22:26.720 --> 22:29.560\n So I don't know if you know the root of the word pioneers\n\n22:30.760 --> 22:34.720\n but you had a chess board here earlier, a pawn.\n\n22:34.720 --> 22:36.760\n In French, it's a pigeon.\n\n22:36.760 --> 22:38.160\n They are the ones that you send to the front\n\n22:38.160 --> 22:40.120\n to get murdered, slaughtered.\n\n22:40.120 --> 22:42.080\n This whole concept of pioneers\n\n22:42.080 --> 22:45.200\n having taken this whole disposable ordinary men\n\n22:45.200 --> 22:48.680\n to actually be the ones that we're now treating as heroes.\n\n22:48.680 --> 22:50.760\n So anyway, there's this juxtaposition of that.\n\n22:50.760 --> 22:53.480\n And then the part that always just strikes me\n\n22:53.480 --> 22:56.680\n is the music and the tonality totally changes.\n\n22:56.680 --> 22:59.000\n And now he describes the attack.\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.920\n It was dark all around.\n\n23:00.920 --> 23:02.960\n There was frost in the ground.\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:05.360\n When the tigers broke free\n\n23:05.360 --> 23:10.360\n and no one survived from the Royal Fusiliers company.\n\n23:10.840 --> 23:13.000\n They were all left behind.\n\n23:13.000 --> 23:15.360\n Most of them dead.\n\n23:15.360 --> 23:18.640\n The rest of them dying.\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:23.640\n And that's how the high command took my daddy from me.\n\n23:24.560 --> 23:27.520\n And that song, even though it's not in the album,\n\n23:27.520 --> 23:29.760\n explains the whole movie.\n\n23:29.760 --> 23:31.840\n Cause it's this movie of misery.\n\n23:31.840 --> 23:34.840\n It's this movie of someone being stuck in their head\n\n23:34.840 --> 23:36.800\n and not being able to get out of it.\n\n23:36.800 --> 23:39.840\n There's no other movie that I think has captured so well\n\n23:39.840 --> 23:44.520\n this prison that is someone's own mind.\n\n23:44.520 --> 23:47.000\n And this wall that you're stuck inside\n\n23:47.000 --> 23:50.440\n and this feeling of loneliness.\n\n23:50.440 --> 23:52.880\n And sort of, is there anybody out there?\n\n23:54.040 --> 23:56.440\n And you know, sort of, hello, hello.\n\n23:56.440 --> 23:58.880\n Is there anybody in there?\n\n23:58.880 --> 24:00.920\n Just nod if you can hear me.\n\n24:00.920 --> 24:02.760\n Is there anyone home?\n\n24:04.280 --> 24:06.560\n Come on, yo.\n\n24:06.560 --> 24:08.800\n I hear you're feeling down.\n\n24:08.800 --> 24:13.800\n Just one minute, I hear you nodding in again.\n\n24:15.440 --> 24:16.840\n Anyway, so.\n\n24:16.840 --> 24:18.080\n Yeah, the prison of your mind.\n\n24:18.080 --> 24:19.560\n So those are the darker moments.\n\n24:19.560 --> 24:22.000\n Exactly, these are the darker moments.\n\n24:22.000 --> 24:25.840\n Yeah, in the darker moments, the mind does feel\n\n24:25.840 --> 24:30.120\n like you're trapped alone in a room with it.\n\n24:30.120 --> 24:32.440\n Yeah, and there's this scene in the movie\n\n24:32.440 --> 24:35.600\n which like, where he just breaks out with his guitar\n\n24:35.600 --> 24:36.840\n and there's this prostitute in the room.\n\n24:36.840 --> 24:39.680\n She starts throwing stuff and then he like, you know\n\n24:39.680 --> 24:41.760\n breaks the window, he throws the chair outside.\n\n24:41.760 --> 24:43.640\n And then you see him laying in the pool\n\n24:43.640 --> 24:45.800\n with his own blood, like, you know, everywhere.\n\n24:45.800 --> 24:48.800\n And then there's these endless hours spent\n\n24:48.800 --> 24:51.640\n fixing every little thing and lining it up.\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:55.240\n And it's this whole sort of mania versus, you know\n\n24:55.240 --> 24:57.320\n you can spend hours building up something\n\n24:57.320 --> 24:59.720\n and just destroy it in a few seconds.\n\n24:59.720 --> 25:01.600\n One of my turns is that song.\n\n25:01.600 --> 25:06.600\n And it's like, I feel cold as a tourniquet\n\n25:07.560 --> 25:10.080\n right as a manor.\n\n25:10.080 --> 25:13.920\n Dry as a funeral drum.\n\n25:13.920 --> 25:17.600\n And then the music also is like, run to the bedroom.\n\n25:17.600 --> 25:19.920\n There's a suitcase on the left.\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:23.280\n There you find my favorite acts.\n\n25:23.280 --> 25:24.960\n Don't look so frightened.\n\n25:24.960 --> 25:27.440\n This is just a passing phase.\n\n25:27.440 --> 25:30.040\n One of my bad days.\n\n25:30.040 --> 25:31.120\n It's just so beautiful.\n\n25:31.120 --> 25:32.360\n I need to rewatch it.\n\n25:32.360 --> 25:34.200\n That's so, you're making me realize.\n\n25:34.200 --> 25:35.800\n But imagine watching this as a teenager.\n\n25:35.800 --> 25:37.760\n It like ruins your mind.\n\n25:37.760 --> 25:42.200\n It's like so many, it's such harsh imagery.\n\n25:42.200 --> 25:46.760\n And then, you know, anyway, so there's the dark moment.\n\n25:46.760 --> 25:48.840\n And then again, going back to Sting\n\n25:48.840 --> 25:50.920\n now it's the political songs, Russians.\n\n25:51.760 --> 25:55.800\n And I think that song should be a new national anthem\n\n25:55.800 --> 25:58.560\n for the US, not for Russians, but for red versus blue.\n\n25:58.560 --> 26:02.360\n Mr. Khrushchev says we will bury you.\n\n26:02.360 --> 26:06.040\n I don't subscribe to this point of view.\n\n26:06.040 --> 26:10.240\n It'd be such an ignorant thing to do\n\n26:10.240 --> 26:14.800\n if the Russians love their children too.\n\n26:14.800 --> 26:15.880\n What is it doing?\n\n26:15.880 --> 26:19.080\n It's basically saying the Russians\n\n26:19.080 --> 26:21.440\n are just as humans as we are.\n\n26:21.440 --> 26:24.920\n There's no way that they're gonna let their children die.\n\n26:24.920 --> 26:26.720\n And then it's just so beautiful.\n\n26:26.720 --> 26:30.240\n How can I save my innocent boy\n\n26:30.240 --> 26:33.520\n from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?\n\n26:33.520 --> 26:36.760\n And now that's the new national anthem, are you reading?\n\n26:36.760 --> 26:40.120\n There is no monopoly of common sense\n\n26:40.120 --> 26:43.880\n on either side of the political fence.\n\n26:43.880 --> 26:47.240\n We share the same biology\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:50.680\n regardless of ideology.\n\n26:50.680 --> 26:54.840\n Believe me when I say to you,\n\n26:54.840 --> 26:59.200\n I hope the Russians love their children too.\n\n27:00.280 --> 27:03.680\n There's no such thing as a winnable war.\n\n27:03.680 --> 27:07.120\n It's a lie we don't believe anymore.\n\n27:08.600 --> 27:10.600\n I mean, it's beautiful, right?\n\n27:10.600 --> 27:13.640\n And for God's sake, America, wake up.\n\n27:13.640 --> 27:15.680\n These are your fellow Americans.\n\n27:15.680 --> 27:19.160\n They're your fellow biology.\n\n27:19.160 --> 27:21.440\n There is no monopoly of common sense\n\n27:21.440 --> 27:23.200\n on either side of the political fence.\n\n27:23.200 --> 27:24.320\n It's just so beautiful.\n\n27:24.320 --> 27:27.360\n There's no crisper, simpler way to say\n\n27:27.360 --> 27:31.600\n Russians love their children too, the common humanity.\n\n27:31.600 --> 27:33.240\n And remember what I was telling you,\n\n27:33.240 --> 27:35.240\n I think in one of our first podcasts\n\n27:35.240 --> 27:39.680\n about the daughter who's crying for her brother\n\n27:39.680 --> 27:40.960\n to come back for more.\n\n27:40.960 --> 27:43.200\n And then the Virgin Mary appears and says,\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:44.520\n who should I take instead?\n\n27:44.520 --> 27:47.600\n This Turk, here's his family, here's his children.\n\n27:47.600 --> 27:51.080\n This other one, he just got married, et cetera.\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:53.280\n And that basically says, no.\n\n27:53.280 --> 27:56.320\n I mean, if you look at the Lord of the Rings,\n\n27:56.320 --> 27:59.520\n the enemies are these monsters, they're not human.\n\n27:59.520 --> 28:00.920\n And that's what we always do.\n\n28:00.920 --> 28:04.880\n We always say, they're not like us, they're different.\n\n28:04.880 --> 28:06.280\n They're not humans, et cetera.\n\n28:06.280 --> 28:08.960\n So there's this dehumanization that has to happen\n\n28:08.960 --> 28:10.240\n for people to go to war.\n\n28:11.480 --> 28:14.320\n If you realize just how close we are genetically,\n\n28:14.320 --> 28:18.720\n one with the other, this whole 99.9% identical,\n\n28:18.720 --> 28:22.160\n you can't bear weapons against someone who's like that.\n\n28:22.160 --> 28:24.240\n And the things that are the most meaningful to us\n\n28:24.240 --> 28:28.680\n in our lives at every level is the same on all sides,\n\n28:28.680 --> 28:29.520\n on both sides.\n\n28:29.520 --> 28:30.360\n Exactly.\n\n28:30.360 --> 28:32.400\n So it's not just that we're genetically the same.\n\n28:32.400 --> 28:34.440\n Yeah, we're ideologically the same.\n\n28:34.440 --> 28:36.400\n We love our children, we love our country.\n\n28:36.400 --> 28:40.600\n We will fight for our family.\n\n28:40.600 --> 28:43.920\n So, and the last one I mentioned last time we spoke,\n\n28:43.920 --> 28:46.440\n which is Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now.\n\n28:47.320 --> 28:51.720\n So she has three rounds, one on clouds, one on love,\n\n28:51.720 --> 28:53.360\n and one on life.\n\n28:53.360 --> 28:55.480\n And on clouds she says,\n\n28:55.480 --> 28:58.840\n Rows and flows of angel hair\n\n28:58.840 --> 29:02.120\n And ice cream castles in the air\n\n29:02.120 --> 29:04.600\n And feather canyons everywhere\n\n29:04.600 --> 29:07.160\n I've looked at clouds that way\n\n29:07.160 --> 29:10.640\n But now they only block the sun\n\n29:10.640 --> 29:14.080\n They rain and snow on everyone\n\n29:14.080 --> 29:17.160\n So many things I would have done\n\n29:17.160 --> 29:19.880\n But clouds got in my way\n\n29:19.880 --> 29:23.280\n And then I've looked at clouds from both sides now\n\n29:23.280 --> 29:25.560\n From up and down\n\n29:25.560 --> 29:28.080\n And still somehow it's\n\n29:28.080 --> 29:31.120\n Clouds illusions I recall\n\n29:31.120 --> 29:36.120\n I really don't know clouds at all\n\n29:36.240 --> 29:37.640\n And then she goes on about love,\n\n29:37.640 --> 29:39.200\n how it's super, super happy,\n\n29:39.200 --> 29:42.280\n or it's about misery and loss and about life,\n\n29:42.280 --> 29:45.400\n how it's about winning and losing and so on and so forth.\n\n29:45.400 --> 29:49.200\n But now old friends are acting strange\n\n29:49.200 --> 29:53.160\n They shake their heads, they say I've changed\n\n29:53.160 --> 29:56.880\n Well, something's lost and something's gained\n\n29:56.880 --> 29:59.480\n In living every day\n\n29:59.480 --> 30:02.360\n So again, that's growing up and realizing that,\n\n30:02.360 --> 30:04.880\n well, the view that you had as a kid\n\n30:04.880 --> 30:07.160\n is not necessarily that you have as an adult.\n\n30:07.160 --> 30:09.880\n Remember my poem from when I was 16 years old\n\n30:09.880 --> 30:11.920\n of this whole, you know,\n\n30:11.920 --> 30:14.720\n children dance now all in row and then in the end,\n\n30:14.720 --> 30:16.200\n even though the snow seems bright,\n\n30:16.200 --> 30:17.720\n without you have lost their light,\n\n30:17.720 --> 30:19.600\n sun that sang and moon that smiled.\n\n30:19.600 --> 30:22.960\n So this whole concept of, if you have love\n\n30:22.960 --> 30:24.520\n and if you have passion,\n\n30:24.520 --> 30:26.680\n you see the exact same thing from a different way.\n\n30:26.680 --> 30:28.480\n You can go out running in the rain\n\n30:28.480 --> 30:29.760\n or you could just stay in and say,\n\n30:29.760 --> 30:32.480\n ah, sucks, I won't be able to go outside now.\n\n30:33.480 --> 30:34.320\n Those sides.\n\n30:34.320 --> 30:36.160\n Anyway, and the last one is,\n\n30:36.160 --> 30:38.360\n last, last one I promise, Leonard Cohen.\n\n30:38.360 --> 30:39.600\n This is amazing by the way.\n\n30:39.600 --> 30:44.600\n I'm so glad we stumbled on how much joy you have\n\n30:44.600 --> 30:49.520\n in so many avenues of life and music is just one of them.\n\n30:49.520 --> 30:50.360\n That's amazing.\n\n30:50.360 --> 30:52.160\n But yes, Leonard Cohen.\n\n30:52.160 --> 30:53.120\n Going back to Leonard Cohen,\n\n30:53.120 --> 30:54.040\n since that's where you started.\n\n30:54.040 --> 30:56.360\n So Leonard Cohen's Dance Me to the End of Love.\n\n30:56.360 --> 30:59.440\n That was our opening song in our wedding with my wife.\n\n30:59.440 --> 31:00.280\n Oh no, that's good.\n\n31:00.280 --> 31:01.720\n As we came out to greet the guests,\n\n31:01.720 --> 31:03.360\n it was Dance Me to the End of Love.\n\n31:03.360 --> 31:06.160\n And then another one, which is just so passionate always\n\n31:06.160 --> 31:09.840\n and we always keep referring back to it is I'm Your Man.\n\n31:09.840 --> 31:12.080\n And it goes on and on about sort of,\n\n31:12.080 --> 31:14.480\n I can be every type of lover for you.\n\n31:14.480 --> 31:16.480\n And what's really beautiful in marriage\n\n31:16.480 --> 31:20.000\n is that we live that with my wife every day.\n\n31:20.000 --> 31:23.040\n You can have the passion, you can have the anger,\n\n31:23.040 --> 31:25.760\n you can have the love, you can have the tenderness.\n\n31:25.760 --> 31:28.160\n There's just so many gems in that song.\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:31.520\n If you want a partner, take my hand.\n\n31:31.520 --> 31:35.600\n Or if you want to strike me down in anger,\n\n31:35.600 --> 31:39.760\n here I stand, I'm your man.\n\n31:39.760 --> 31:43.680\n Then if you want a boxer, I will step into the ring for you.\n\n31:43.680 --> 31:46.400\n If you want a driver, climb inside.\n\n31:46.400 --> 31:50.480\n Or if you want to take me for a ride, you know you can.\n\n31:50.480 --> 31:53.840\n So this whole concept of you want to drive, I'll follow.\n\n31:53.840 --> 31:55.520\n You want me to drive, I'll drive.\n\n31:56.640 --> 31:58.640\n And the difference I would say between like that\n\n31:58.640 --> 32:01.760\n and Nemaki Tapa is this song, he's got an attitude.\n\n32:01.760 --> 32:06.080\n He's like, he's proud of his ability\n\n32:06.080 --> 32:09.120\n to basically be any kind of man for as long as opposed\n\n32:09.120 --> 32:14.120\n to the Jacques Brel like desperation of what do I have to be\n\n32:14.800 --> 32:17.520\n for you to love me, that kind of desperation.\n\n32:17.520 --> 32:20.160\n But notice there's a parallel here.\n\n32:20.160 --> 32:22.720\n There's a verse that is perhaps not paid attention\n\n32:22.720 --> 32:27.720\n to as much which says, ah, but a man never got a woman back,\n\n32:29.120 --> 32:32.440\n not by begging on his knees.\n\n32:32.440 --> 32:34.560\n So it seems that the I'm your man\n\n32:34.560 --> 32:37.760\n is actually an apology song in the same way\n\n32:37.760 --> 32:40.480\n that Nemaki Tapa is an apology song.\n\n32:40.480 --> 32:44.800\n Nemaki Tapa basically says I've screwed up.\n\n32:44.800 --> 32:45.680\n I'm sorry, baby.\n\n32:45.680 --> 32:48.000\n And in the same way that the Careless Whisper\n\n32:48.000 --> 32:48.880\n is I'm screwed up.\n\n32:48.880 --> 32:50.240\n Yes, that's right.\n\n32:50.240 --> 32:52.560\n I'm never gonna dance again.\n\n32:52.560 --> 32:55.280\n Guilty feet have got no rhythm.\n\n32:57.440 --> 32:59.840\n So this is an apology song, not by begging on his knees\n\n32:59.840 --> 33:03.360\n or I'd crawl to you, baby, and I'd fall at your feet\n\n33:03.360 --> 33:07.280\n and I'd howl at your beauty like a dog in heat\n\n33:07.280 --> 33:11.040\n and I'd claw at your heart and I'd tear at your sheet.\n\n33:11.040 --> 33:12.080\n I'd say please.\n\n33:13.840 --> 33:16.720\n And then the last one is so beautiful.\n\n33:18.480 --> 33:21.360\n If you want a father for your child\n\n33:22.080 --> 33:27.120\n or only want to walk with me a while across the sand,\n\n33:28.400 --> 33:29.440\n I'm your man.\n\n33:30.480 --> 33:33.200\n That's the last verses which basically says\n\n33:33.200 --> 33:34.240\n you want me for a day?\n\n33:35.680 --> 33:36.720\n I'll be there.\n\n33:36.720 --> 33:37.760\n Do you want me to just walk?\n\n33:37.760 --> 33:38.240\n I'll be there.\n\n33:38.240 --> 33:39.840\n You want me for life?\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:41.200\n Do you want a father for your child?\n\n33:41.200 --> 33:42.240\n I'll be there too.\n\n33:42.240 --> 33:43.600\n It's just so beautiful.\n\n33:43.600 --> 33:44.560\n Oh, sorry.\n\n33:44.560 --> 33:45.680\n Remember how I told you I was gonna finish\n\n33:45.680 --> 33:46.800\n with a lighthearted song?\n\n33:46.800 --> 33:47.300\n Yes.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:48.880\n Last one.\n\n33:48.880 --> 33:49.380\n You ready?\n\n33:49.840 --> 33:53.200\n So Alison Krauss and Union Station,\n\n33:53.200 --> 33:55.600\n country song, believe it or not, the lucky one.\n\n33:57.280 --> 34:01.120\n So I've never identified as much\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:05.840\n with the lyrics of a song as this one.\n\n34:05.840 --> 34:06.720\n And it's hilarious.\n\n34:06.720 --> 34:08.000\n My friend, Serafim Batoglou,\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:11.600\n is the guy who got me to genomics in the first place.\n\n34:11.600 --> 34:13.520\n I owe enormously to him.\n\n34:13.520 --> 34:14.640\n And he's another Greek.\n\n34:14.640 --> 34:16.080\n We actually met dancing, believe it or not.\n\n34:16.080 --> 34:17.920\n So we used to perform Greek dances.\n\n34:18.480 --> 34:20.400\n I was the president of the International Students Association.\n\n34:20.400 --> 34:22.160\n So we put on these big performances\n\n34:22.160 --> 34:24.080\n for 500 people at MIT.\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:26.320\n And there's a picture on the MIT Tech\n\n34:26.320 --> 34:29.280\n where Serafim, who's like a bodybuilder,\n\n34:29.280 --> 34:30.560\n was holding me on his shoulder.\n\n34:30.560 --> 34:33.120\n And I was like doing maneuvers in the air, basically.\n\n34:34.160 --> 34:35.760\n So anyway, this guy, Serafim,\n\n34:35.760 --> 34:40.160\n we were driving back from a conference.\n\n34:40.160 --> 34:41.680\n And there's this Russian girl\n\n34:41.680 --> 34:44.000\n who was describing how every member of her family\n\n34:44.000 --> 34:46.000\n had been either killed by the communists\n\n34:46.000 --> 34:48.400\n or killed by the Germans or killed by the,\n\n34:48.400 --> 34:51.280\n like, she had just like, you know, misery,\n\n34:51.280 --> 34:54.880\n like death and, you know, sickness and everything.\n\n34:54.880 --> 34:56.240\n Everyone was decimated in her family.\n\n34:56.240 --> 34:57.280\n She was the last standing member.\n\n34:57.840 --> 35:00.400\n And we stopped at a, Serafim was driving\n\n35:00.400 --> 35:02.560\n and we stopped at a rest area.\n\n35:02.560 --> 35:04.320\n And he takes me aside and he's like,\n\n35:04.320 --> 35:05.760\n Manolis, we're gonna crash.\n\n35:07.920 --> 35:08.880\n Get her out of my car.\n\n35:10.000 --> 35:11.120\n And then he basically says,\n\n35:11.120 --> 35:14.880\n but I'm only reassured because you're here with me.\n\n35:14.880 --> 35:15.680\n And I'm like, what do you mean?\n\n35:15.680 --> 35:18.080\n He's like, you know, he's like, from your smile,\n\n35:18.720 --> 35:20.400\n I know you're the luckiest man on the planet.\n\n35:22.320 --> 35:24.080\n So there's this really funny thing\n\n35:24.080 --> 35:27.760\n where I just feel freaking lucky all the time.\n\n35:28.480 --> 35:30.400\n And it's a question of attitude.\n\n35:30.400 --> 35:32.240\n Of course, I'm not any luckier than any other person,\n\n35:32.240 --> 35:34.880\n but every time something horrible happens to me,\n\n35:34.880 --> 35:36.960\n I'm like, and in fact, even in that song,\n\n35:36.960 --> 35:38.880\n the song about sort of, you know,\n\n35:38.880 --> 35:40.720\n walking on the beach and this, you know,\n\n35:40.720 --> 35:43.040\n sort of taking our life the wrong way\n\n35:43.040 --> 35:45.200\n and then, you know, having to turn around.\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:47.200\n At some point he's like, you know,\n\n35:47.200 --> 35:49.840\n in the fresh sand, we wrote her name.\n\n35:53.200 --> 35:57.360\n So how nicely that the wind blew and the writing was erased.\n\n35:58.720 --> 36:00.320\n So again, it's this whole sort of,\n\n36:00.320 --> 36:05.200\n not just saying, oh, bummer, but, oh, great.\n\n36:05.200 --> 36:06.400\n I just lost this.\n\n36:06.400 --> 36:09.760\n This must mean something, right?\n\n36:09.760 --> 36:11.120\n This horrible thing happened,\n\n36:11.120 --> 36:14.640\n it must open the door to a beautiful chapter.\n\n36:14.640 --> 36:17.680\n So, so Allison Krauss is talking about the lucky one.\n\n36:17.680 --> 36:19.520\n So I was like, oh my God, she wrote a song for me.\n\n36:21.200 --> 36:24.640\n And she goes, you're the lucky one, I know that now,\n\n36:24.640 --> 36:27.280\n as free as the wind blowing down the road,\n\n36:27.280 --> 36:30.640\n loved by many, hated by none, I'd say,\n\n36:30.640 --> 36:32.480\n you were lucky because you know what you've done,\n\n36:32.480 --> 36:34.960\n not the care in the world, not the worry inside.\n\n36:35.920 --> 36:37.520\n Everything's going to be all right\n\n36:37.520 --> 36:38.720\n because you're the lucky one.\n\n36:39.520 --> 36:42.240\n And then she goes, you're the lucky one,\n\n36:42.240 --> 36:44.560\n always having fun, a jack of all trades,\n\n36:44.560 --> 36:45.760\n a master of none.\n\n36:45.760 --> 36:48.000\n You look at the world with the smiling eyes\n\n36:48.000 --> 36:50.720\n and laugh at the devil as his train rolls by.\n\n36:50.720 --> 36:52.880\n I'll give you a song and a one night stand.\n\n36:53.520 --> 36:55.440\n You'll be looking at a happy man\n\n36:55.440 --> 36:57.120\n because you're the lucky one.\n\n36:57.120 --> 37:00.720\n It basically says, if you just don't worry too much,\n\n37:01.360 --> 37:06.640\n if you don't try to be a one trick pony,\n\n37:06.640 --> 37:08.960\n if you just embrace the fact\n\n37:08.960 --> 37:10.640\n that you might suck at a bunch of things,\n\n37:10.640 --> 37:12.560\n but you're just gonna try a lot of things.\n\n37:12.560 --> 37:14.400\n And then there's another verse that says,\n\n37:15.040 --> 37:17.120\n well, you're blessed I guess,\n\n37:17.120 --> 37:20.000\n but never knowing which road you're choosing,\n\n37:20.000 --> 37:22.160\n to you the next best thing\n\n37:22.160 --> 37:24.480\n to playing and winning is playing and losing.\n\n37:24.480 --> 37:26.480\n It's just so beautiful\n\n37:26.480 --> 37:27.760\n because he basically says,\n\n37:28.240 --> 37:32.640\n if you try your best,\n\n37:33.280 --> 37:34.720\n but it's still playing,\n\n37:35.520 --> 37:36.800\n if you lose, it's okay.\n\n37:36.800 --> 37:37.760\n You had an awesome game.\n\n37:38.880 --> 37:41.280\n And again, superficially,\n\n37:41.280 --> 37:43.040\n it sounds like a super happy song.\n\n37:43.040 --> 37:46.160\n But then there's the last verse basically says,\n\n37:46.160 --> 37:47.920\n no matter where you are, that's where you'll be.\n\n37:47.920 --> 37:50.240\n You can bet your luck won't follow me.\n\n37:50.720 --> 37:53.040\n Just give you a song and then one night stand,\n\n37:53.040 --> 37:54.720\n you'll be looking at a happy man.\n\n37:54.720 --> 37:56.160\n And then in the video of the song,\n\n37:56.160 --> 37:57.760\n she just walks away or he just walks away\n\n37:57.760 --> 37:58.560\n or something like that.\n\n37:59.120 --> 38:00.560\n And it basically tells you\n\n38:00.560 --> 38:02.800\n that freedom comes at a price.\n\n38:03.600 --> 38:05.680\n Freedom comes at the price of non commitment.\n\n38:05.680 --> 38:07.040\n This whole sort of birds who love\n\n38:07.040 --> 38:07.920\n or birds who cry,\n\n38:08.400 --> 38:11.600\n you can't really love unless you cry.\n\n38:11.600 --> 38:12.800\n You can't just be the lucky one,\n\n38:12.800 --> 38:14.000\n the happy boy, la la la,\n\n38:14.960 --> 38:17.280\n and yet have a long term relationship.\n\n38:18.160 --> 38:20.240\n So it's, on one hand,\n\n38:20.240 --> 38:22.240\n I identify with the shallowness of this song,\n\n38:22.240 --> 38:24.080\n of you know, you're the lucky one,\n\n38:24.080 --> 38:25.360\n jack of all trades, a master or none.\n\n38:26.560 --> 38:27.840\n But at the same time,\n\n38:27.840 --> 38:29.920\n I identify with a lesson of,\n\n38:29.920 --> 38:31.920\n well, you can't just be the happy,\n\n38:31.920 --> 38:33.520\n merry, go lucky all the time.\n\n38:33.520 --> 38:35.440\n Sometimes you have to embrace loss\n\n38:35.440 --> 38:37.440\n and sometimes you have to embrace suffering.\n\n38:37.440 --> 38:39.440\n And sometimes you have to embrace that.\n\n38:40.640 --> 38:42.160\n If you have a safety net,\n\n38:42.160 --> 38:43.600\n you're not really committing enough.\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:45.600\n You're not, you know,\n\n38:45.600 --> 38:48.000\n basically you're allowing yourself to slip.\n\n38:49.040 --> 38:50.480\n But if you just go all in\n\n38:50.480 --> 38:52.000\n and you just, you know,\n\n38:52.000 --> 38:53.520\n let go of your reservations,\n\n38:53.520 --> 38:55.200\n that's when you truly will get somewhere.\n\n38:56.320 --> 38:58.160\n So anyway, that's like the,\n\n38:58.160 --> 39:00.720\n I managed to narrow it down to what, 15 songs?\n\n39:01.760 --> 39:03.760\n Thank you for that wonderful journey\n\n39:03.760 --> 39:04.880\n that you just took us on,\n\n39:04.880 --> 39:10.480\n the darkest possible places of Greek song\n\n39:10.480 --> 39:13.520\n to ending on this country song.\n\n39:13.520 --> 39:15.120\n I haven't heard it before,\n\n39:15.120 --> 39:16.800\n but that's exactly right.\n\n39:16.800 --> 39:17.760\n I feel the same way,\n\n39:17.760 --> 39:19.840\n depending on the day,\n\n39:19.840 --> 39:22.240\n is this the luckiest human on earth.\n\n39:22.240 --> 39:23.840\n And there's something to that,\n\n39:23.840 --> 39:27.520\n but you're right, it needs to be,\n\n39:27.520 --> 39:30.800\n we need to now return to the muck of life\n\n39:30.800 --> 39:35.280\n in order to be able to truly enjoy it.\n\n39:35.280 --> 39:35.760\n So it's...\n\n39:35.760 --> 39:36.640\n What do you mean muck?\n\n39:36.640 --> 39:37.200\n What's muck?\n\n39:38.000 --> 39:39.280\n The messiness of life.\n\n39:39.280 --> 39:39.760\n Yeah.\n\n39:39.760 --> 39:41.440\n The things that were,\n\n39:41.440 --> 39:44.480\n things don't turn out the way you expect it to.\n\n39:44.480 --> 39:44.960\n Yeah.\n\n39:44.960 --> 39:47.520\n So like, to feel like you're in the right place,\n\n39:47.520 --> 39:48.800\n to feel lucky,\n\n39:48.800 --> 39:51.680\n is like focusing on the beautiful consequences.\n\n39:51.680 --> 39:52.080\n Yeah.\n\n39:52.080 --> 39:55.440\n But then that feeling of things being different\n\n39:55.440 --> 39:56.640\n than you expected,\n\n39:56.640 --> 39:59.680\n that you stumble in all the kinds of ways,\n\n39:59.680 --> 40:01.280\n that seems to be,\n\n40:01.280 --> 40:03.200\n needs to be paired with the feeling of luck.\n\n40:03.200 --> 40:04.640\n There's basically one way,\n\n40:04.640 --> 40:06.400\n the only way not to make mistakes,\n\n40:06.400 --> 40:07.760\n is to never do anything.\n\n40:07.760 --> 40:08.000\n Right.\n\n40:10.080 --> 40:11.680\n Basically, you have to embrace the fact\n\n40:11.680 --> 40:13.360\n that you'll be wrong so many times.\n\n40:13.360 --> 40:14.720\n In so many research meetings,\n\n40:14.720 --> 40:17.120\n I just go off on a tangent and say,\n\n40:17.120 --> 40:18.880\n let's think about this for a second.\n\n40:18.880 --> 40:21.120\n And it's just crazy for me,\n\n40:21.120 --> 40:22.400\n who's a computer scientist,\n\n40:22.400 --> 40:24.080\n to just tell my biologist friends,\n\n40:24.080 --> 40:25.680\n what if biology kind of worked this way?\n\n40:25.680 --> 40:26.800\n Yeah.\n\n40:26.800 --> 40:27.840\n And they humor me.\n\n40:27.840 --> 40:28.800\n They just let me talk.\n\n40:29.600 --> 40:33.360\n And rarely has it not gone somewhere good.\n\n40:34.160 --> 40:35.600\n It's not that I'm always right,\n\n40:35.600 --> 40:38.560\n but it's always something worth exploring further,\n\n40:39.120 --> 40:42.800\n that if you're an outsider with humility\n\n40:42.800 --> 40:46.000\n and knowing that I'll be wrong a bunch of times,\n\n40:46.000 --> 40:48.320\n but I'll challenge your assumptions,\n\n40:49.680 --> 40:51.520\n and often take us to a better place,\n\n40:52.320 --> 40:54.880\n is part of this whole sort of messiness of life.\n\n40:54.880 --> 40:58.000\n Like if you don't try and lose and get hurt\n\n40:58.000 --> 41:01.040\n and suffer and cry and just break your heart\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:03.680\n and all these feelings of guilt and,\n\n41:03.680 --> 41:04.960\n wow, I did the wrong thing.\n\n41:06.400 --> 41:07.680\n Of course, that's part of life.\n\n41:07.680 --> 41:08.800\n And that's just something that,\n\n41:08.800 --> 41:11.600\n if you are a doer, you'll make mistakes.\n\n41:12.400 --> 41:14.720\n If you're a criticizer, yeah, sure,\n\n41:14.720 --> 41:16.880\n you can sit back and criticize everybody else\n\n41:16.880 --> 41:17.840\n for the mistakes they make.\n\n41:18.560 --> 41:21.360\n Or instead, you can just be out there making those mistakes.\n\n41:21.360 --> 41:23.360\n And frankly, I'd rather be the criticized one\n\n41:23.360 --> 41:24.240\n than the criticizer.\n\n41:24.240 --> 41:25.920\n Yeah, brilliantly put.\n\n41:25.920 --> 41:27.600\n Every time somebody steals my bicycle,\n\n41:27.600 --> 41:29.600\n I say, well, no, my son's like,\n\n41:29.600 --> 41:31.360\n why do they steal our bicycle, dad?\n\n41:31.360 --> 41:34.400\n And I'm like, aren't you happy that you have bicycles\n\n41:34.400 --> 41:35.200\n that people can steal?\n\n41:35.200 --> 41:36.020\n Yeah.\n\n41:36.020 --> 41:39.000\n Aren't you happy that you have bicycles that people can steal?\n\n41:39.000 --> 41:41.640\n I'd rather be the person stolen from than the stealer.\n\n41:41.640 --> 41:44.360\n Yeah, it's not the critic that counts.\n\n41:45.080 --> 41:49.080\n So that's, we've just talked amazingly\n\n41:49.080 --> 41:51.000\n about life from the music perspective.\n\n41:51.640 --> 41:55.080\n Let's talk about life from, human life,\n\n41:55.080 --> 41:57.320\n from perhaps other perspective and its meaning.\n\n41:57.320 --> 42:00.520\n So this is episode 142.\n\n42:00.520 --> 42:05.520\n There is perhaps an absurdly deep meaning\n\n42:08.840 --> 42:13.680\n to the number 42 that our culture has elevated.\n\n42:13.680 --> 42:16.760\n So this is a perfect time to talk about the meaning of life.\n\n42:16.760 --> 42:18.400\n We've talked about it already,\n\n42:18.400 --> 42:22.840\n but do you think this question that's so simple\n\n42:23.880 --> 42:27.540\n and so seemingly absurd has value\n\n42:27.540 --> 42:29.160\n of what is the meaning of life?\n\n42:29.160 --> 42:33.280\n Is it something that raising the question\n\n42:33.280 --> 42:36.520\n and trying to answer it, is that a ridiculous pursuit\n\n42:36.520 --> 42:37.560\n or is there some value?\n\n42:37.560 --> 42:39.360\n Is it answerable at all?\n\n42:39.360 --> 42:42.560\n So first of all, I feel that we owe it to your listeners\n\n42:42.560 --> 42:44.000\n to say why 42?\n\n42:44.000 --> 42:44.840\n Sure.\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:48.340\n So of course the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\n\n42:48.340 --> 42:52.220\n came up with 42 as basically a random number.\n\n42:52.220 --> 42:55.480\n Just, you know, the author just pulled it out of a hat\n\n42:55.480 --> 42:56.680\n and he's admitted so.\n\n42:56.680 --> 43:00.320\n He said, well, 42 just seemed like just random numbers any.\n\n43:01.480 --> 43:05.480\n But in fact, there's many numbers that are linked to 42.\n\n43:05.480 --> 43:09.320\n So 42, again, just to summarize,\n\n43:09.320 --> 43:13.860\n is the answer that these super mega computer\n\n43:13.860 --> 43:15.960\n that had computed for a million years\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:17.800\n with the most powerful computer in the world\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:18.840\n had come up with.\n\n43:18.840 --> 43:20.640\n At some point, the computer says,\n\n43:21.980 --> 43:23.340\n I have an answer.\n\n43:23.340 --> 43:25.360\n And they're like, what?\n\n43:25.360 --> 43:27.200\n It's like, you're not gonna like it.\n\n43:27.200 --> 43:28.280\n Like, what is it?\n\n43:28.280 --> 43:29.120\n It's 42.\n\n43:30.480 --> 43:33.080\n And then the irony is that they had forgotten, of course,\n\n43:33.080 --> 43:33.920\n what the question was.\n\n43:33.920 --> 43:34.880\n Yes.\n\n43:34.880 --> 43:36.360\n So now they have to build a bigger computer\n\n43:36.360 --> 43:37.960\n to figure out what the question is,\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:39.420\n to which the answer is 42.\n\n43:39.420 --> 43:41.520\n So as I was turning 42,\n\n43:41.520 --> 43:43.820\n I basically sort of researched\n\n43:43.820 --> 43:45.760\n why 42 is such a cool number.\n\n43:45.760 --> 43:47.240\n And it turns out that,\n\n43:47.240 --> 43:48.960\n and I put together this little passage\n\n43:48.960 --> 43:51.200\n that was explaining to all those guests\n\n43:51.200 --> 43:53.120\n to my 42nd birthday party\n\n43:53.120 --> 43:54.920\n why we were talking about the meaning of life.\n\n43:54.920 --> 43:58.520\n And basically talked about how 42\n\n43:58.520 --> 44:03.240\n is the angle at which light reflects off of water\n\n44:03.240 --> 44:04.300\n to create a rainbow.\n\n44:05.760 --> 44:07.800\n And it's so beautiful because the rainbow\n\n44:07.800 --> 44:09.920\n is basically the combination of sort of,\n\n44:09.920 --> 44:11.800\n it's been raining, but there's hope\n\n44:11.800 --> 44:13.320\n because the sun just came out.\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:14.920\n So it's a very beautiful number there.\n\n44:14.920 --> 44:17.780\n So 42 is also the sum of all rows and columns\n\n44:17.780 --> 44:21.400\n of a magic cube that contains all consecutive integers\n\n44:21.400 --> 44:22.760\n starting at one.\n\n44:22.760 --> 44:24.680\n So basically, if you take all integers\n\n44:24.680 --> 44:27.360\n between one and however many vertices there are,\n\n44:27.360 --> 44:28.880\n the sums is always 42.\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:34.240\n 42 is the only number left under 100\n\n44:34.240 --> 44:36.560\n for which the equation of X to the cube\n\n44:36.560 --> 44:39.720\n plus Y to the cube plus Z to the cube is N\n\n44:39.720 --> 44:42.000\n and was not known to not have a solution.\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:46.160\n And now it's the only one that actually has a solution.\n\n44:46.160 --> 44:50.240\n 42 is also one, zero, one, zero, one, zero in binary.\n\n44:50.240 --> 44:51.520\n Again, the yin and the yang,\n\n44:51.520 --> 44:52.680\n the good and the evil,\n\n44:52.680 --> 44:54.960\n one and zero, the balance of the force.\n\n44:54.960 --> 44:58.320\n 42 is the number of chromosomes for the giant panda.\n\n44:58.320 --> 45:01.920\n And the giant panda, I know it's totally random.\n\n45:01.920 --> 45:04.280\n It's a suspicious symbol of great strength\n\n45:04.280 --> 45:07.480\n coupled with peace, friendship, gentle temperament,\n\n45:07.480 --> 45:09.520\n harmony, balance, and friendship\n\n45:09.520 --> 45:12.560\n whose black and white colors again symbolize yin and yang.\n\n45:12.560 --> 45:15.040\n The reason why it's the symbol for China\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:19.840\n is exactly the strength, but yet peace and so on and so forth.\n\n45:19.840 --> 45:21.680\n So 42 chromosomes.\n\n45:21.680 --> 45:24.960\n It takes light 10 to the minus 42 seconds\n\n45:24.960 --> 45:27.880\n to cross the diameter of a proton\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:29.560\n connecting the two fundamental dimensions\n\n45:29.560 --> 45:31.160\n of space and time.\n\n45:31.160 --> 45:33.520\n 42 is the number of times a piece of paper\n\n45:33.520 --> 45:36.000\n should be folded to reach beyond the moon,\n\n45:40.120 --> 45:41.960\n which is what I assume my students mean\n\n45:41.960 --> 45:44.560\n when they ask that their paper reaches for the stars.\n\n45:44.560 --> 45:46.400\n I just tell them just fold it a bunch of times.\n\n45:46.400 --> 45:51.400\n 42 is the number of messier object, 42, which is Orion.\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:58.520\n And that's one of the most famous galaxies.\n\n45:58.520 --> 46:00.800\n It's I think also the place where we can actually see\n\n46:00.800 --> 46:03.000\n the center of our galaxy.\n\n46:03.000 --> 46:05.680\n 42 is the numeric representation of the star symbol\n\n46:05.680 --> 46:09.200\n in ASCII, which is very useful\n\n46:09.200 --> 46:10.880\n when searching for the stars.\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:14.240\n And also a reg exp for life, the universe and everything.\n\n46:14.240 --> 46:19.240\n So star, in Egyptian mythology, the goddess Maat\n\n46:20.120 --> 46:22.320\n which was personifying truth and justice\n\n46:22.320 --> 46:25.600\n would ask 42 questions to every dying person.\n\n46:25.600 --> 46:27.960\n And those answering successfully would become stars\n\n46:27.960 --> 46:30.440\n continued to give life and fuel universal growth.\n\n46:31.320 --> 46:35.680\n In Judaic tradition, God ascribe the 42 lettered name\n\n46:35.680 --> 46:38.080\n and trusted only to the middle age pious meek\n\n46:38.080 --> 46:42.120\n free from bad temper, sober and not insistent on his rights.\n\n46:42.120 --> 46:44.440\n And in Christian tradition, there's 42 generations\n\n46:44.440 --> 46:47.240\n from Abraham, Isaac, that we talked about,\n\n46:47.240 --> 46:51.520\n the story of Isaac, Jacob, eventually Joseph, Mary and Jesus.\n\n46:51.520 --> 46:54.920\n In Kabbalistic tradition, Elocha, which is 42\n\n46:54.920 --> 46:57.920\n is the number with which God creates the universe\n\n46:57.920 --> 47:02.920\n starting with 25, let there be and ending with 70, good.\n\n47:02.920 --> 47:07.920\n So 25 plus, you know, 17, there's a 42 chapter sutra,\n\n47:08.480 --> 47:10.600\n which is the first Indian religious tradition\n\n47:10.600 --> 47:12.840\n which is the first Indian religious scripture\n\n47:12.840 --> 47:14.640\n which was translated to Chinese,\n\n47:14.640 --> 47:18.800\n thus introducing Buddhism to China from India.\n\n47:18.800 --> 47:21.920\n The 42 line Bible was the first printed book\n\n47:21.920 --> 47:25.760\n marking the age of printing in the 1450s\n\n47:25.760 --> 47:27.240\n and the dissemination of knowledge\n\n47:27.240 --> 47:29.560\n eventually leading to the enlightenment.\n\n47:29.560 --> 47:33.240\n A yeast cell, which is called a single cell eukaryote\n\n47:33.240 --> 47:34.800\n and the subject of my PhD research\n\n47:34.800 --> 47:38.080\n has exactly 42 million proteins.\n\n47:38.080 --> 47:40.840\n Anyway, so there's a series of 42.\n\n47:40.840 --> 47:42.920\n You're on fire with this, these are really good.\n\n47:42.920 --> 47:45.680\n So I guess what you're saying is just a random number.\n\n47:45.680 --> 47:47.280\n Yeah, basically.\n\n47:47.280 --> 47:49.200\n So all of these are backronyms.\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:50.440\n So, you know, after you have the number,\n\n47:50.440 --> 47:52.120\n you figure out why that number.\n\n47:52.120 --> 47:56.360\n So anyway, so now that we've spoken about Y42,\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:58.240\n why do we search for meaning?\n\n47:58.240 --> 48:01.080\n And you're asking, you know, will that search\n\n48:01.080 --> 48:02.560\n ultimately lead to our destruction?\n\n48:02.560 --> 48:04.840\n And my thinking is exactly the opposite.\n\n48:04.840 --> 48:08.520\n So basically that asking about meaning\n\n48:08.520 --> 48:11.480\n is something that's so inherent to human nature.\n\n48:11.480 --> 48:13.440\n It's something that makes life beautiful\n\n48:13.440 --> 48:14.960\n that makes it worth living.\n\n48:14.960 --> 48:18.480\n And that searching for meaning is actually the point.\n\n48:18.480 --> 48:19.680\n It's not the finding it.\n\n48:19.680 --> 48:21.640\n I think when you found it, you're dead.\n\n48:22.720 --> 48:26.520\n Don't ever be satisfied that, you know, I've got it.\n\n48:26.520 --> 48:30.080\n So I like to say that life is lived forward\n\n48:30.080 --> 48:32.280\n but it only makes sense backward.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:34.440\n And I don't remember whose quote that is,\n\n48:34.440 --> 48:39.440\n but the whole search itself is the meaning.\n\n48:39.680 --> 48:41.880\n And what I love about it is that\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:44.960\n there's a double search going on.\n\n48:44.960 --> 48:47.640\n There's a search in every one of us\n\n48:47.640 --> 48:50.760\n through our own lives to find meaning.\n\n48:50.760 --> 48:52.960\n And then there's a search which is happening\n\n48:52.960 --> 48:55.920\n for humanity itself to find our meaning.\n\n48:56.800 --> 49:01.560\n And we as humans like to look at animals and say,\n\n49:01.560 --> 49:03.120\n of course they have a meaning.\n\n49:03.120 --> 49:04.960\n Like a dog has its meaning.\n\n49:04.960 --> 49:07.000\n It's just a bunch of instincts, you know,\n\n49:07.000 --> 49:09.400\n running around, loving everything.\n\n49:09.400 --> 49:11.520\n You know, remember our joke with a cat and the dog.\n\n49:11.520 --> 49:14.360\n Yeah, cat has no meaning.\n\n49:14.360 --> 49:15.400\n No, no.\n\n49:15.400 --> 49:20.400\n So, and I'm noticing the yin yang symbol right here\n\n49:20.600 --> 49:23.360\n with this whole panda, black and white and the 0102.\n\n49:23.360 --> 49:24.960\n You're on fire with that 42.\n\n49:24.960 --> 49:29.520\n Some of those are gold ASCII value for a star symbol.\n\n49:29.520 --> 49:30.360\n Damn.\n\n49:30.360 --> 49:34.280\n So basically in my view, the search for meaning\n\n49:34.280 --> 49:39.200\n and the act of searching for something more meaningful\n\n49:39.200 --> 49:43.160\n is life's meaning by itself.\n\n49:43.160 --> 49:45.600\n The fact that we kind of always hope that,\n\n49:45.600 --> 49:47.960\n yes, maybe for animals that's not the case,\n\n49:47.960 --> 49:51.200\n but maybe humans have something that we should be doing\n\n49:51.200 --> 49:52.040\n and something else.\n\n49:52.040 --> 49:53.480\n And it's not just about procreation.\n\n49:53.480 --> 49:55.400\n It's not just about dominance.\n\n49:55.400 --> 49:58.320\n It's not just about strength and feeding, et cetera.\n\n49:58.320 --> 50:00.840\n Like we're the one species that spends such a tiny,\n\n50:00.840 --> 50:03.400\n little minority of its time feeding\n\n50:03.400 --> 50:08.400\n that we have this enormous, huge cognitive capability\n\n50:08.720 --> 50:11.080\n that we can just use for all kinds of other stuff.\n\n50:11.080 --> 50:12.880\n And that's where art comes in.\n\n50:12.880 --> 50:15.920\n That's where the healthy mind comes in\n\n50:15.920 --> 50:18.280\n with exploring all of these different aspects\n\n50:18.280 --> 50:23.280\n that are just not directly tied to a purpose.\n\n50:23.560 --> 50:25.760\n That's not directly tied to a function.\n\n50:25.760 --> 50:28.520\n It's really just the playing of life.\n\n50:28.520 --> 50:32.400\n The, you know, not for particular reason.\n\n50:32.400 --> 50:34.240\n Do you think this thing we got,\n\n50:34.240 --> 50:38.120\n this mind is unique in the universe\n\n50:39.640 --> 50:41.680\n in terms of how difficult it is to build?\n\n50:43.320 --> 50:47.480\n Is it possible that we're the most beautiful thing\n\n50:47.480 --> 50:49.840\n that the universe has constructed?\n\n50:49.840 --> 50:51.120\n Both the most beautiful and the most ugly,\n\n50:51.120 --> 50:52.520\n but certainly the most complex.\n\n50:52.520 --> 50:55.040\n So look at evolutionary time.\n\n50:55.040 --> 50:58.880\n The dinosaurs ruled the earth for 135 million years.\n\n50:58.880 --> 51:00.920\n We've been around for a million years.\n\n51:02.960 --> 51:05.800\n So one versus 135.\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:07.720\n So dinosaurs were extinct, you know,\n\n51:07.720 --> 51:09.080\n about 60 million years ago\n\n51:09.080 --> 51:11.000\n and mammals that had been happily evolving\n\n51:11.000 --> 51:13.280\n as tiny little creatures for 30 million years\n\n51:13.280 --> 51:15.440\n then took over the planet and then, you know,\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:17.960\n dramatically radiated about 60 million years ago.\n\n51:19.080 --> 51:24.000\n Out of these mammals came the neocortex formation.\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:25.560\n So basically the neocortex,\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:28.040\n which is sort of the outer layer of our brain\n\n51:28.040 --> 51:29.800\n compared to our quote unquote reptilian brain,\n\n51:29.800 --> 51:33.160\n which we share the structure of with all of the dinosaurs.\n\n51:33.160 --> 51:36.000\n They didn't have that and yet they ruled the planet.\n\n51:36.000 --> 51:38.720\n So how many other planets have still, you know,\n\n51:38.720 --> 51:41.560\n mindless dinosaurs where strength\n\n51:41.560 --> 51:45.440\n was the only dimension ruling the planet?\n\n51:45.440 --> 51:49.360\n So there was something weird that annihilated the dinosaurs.\n\n51:49.360 --> 51:51.040\n And again, you could look at biblical things\n\n51:51.040 --> 51:53.720\n of sort of God coming and wiping out his creatures\n\n51:53.720 --> 51:55.080\n to make room for the next ones.\n\n51:55.080 --> 51:59.120\n So the mammals basically sort of took over the planet\n\n51:59.120 --> 52:03.160\n and then grew this cognitive capability\n\n52:03.160 --> 52:06.240\n of this general purpose machine.\n\n52:06.240 --> 52:10.520\n And primates push that to extreme\n\n52:10.520 --> 52:15.480\n and humans among primates have just exploded that hardware.\n\n52:15.480 --> 52:20.480\n But that hardware is selected for survival.\n\n52:20.480 --> 52:23.080\n It's selected for procreation.\n\n52:23.080 --> 52:26.160\n It's initially selected with his very simple\n\n52:26.160 --> 52:30.440\n Darwinian view of the world of random mutation,\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:32.640\n ruthless selection, and then selection\n\n52:32.640 --> 52:34.240\n for making more of yourself.\n\n52:35.720 --> 52:38.880\n If you look at human cognition,\n\n52:38.880 --> 52:41.680\n it's gone down a weird evolutionary path\n\n52:41.680 --> 52:44.800\n in the sense that we are expanding\n\n52:44.800 --> 52:47.840\n an enormous amount of energy on this apparatus\n\n52:47.840 --> 52:50.720\n between our ears that is wasting, what,\n\n52:50.720 --> 52:53.800\n 15% of our bodily energy, 20%,\n\n52:53.800 --> 52:57.800\n like some enormous percentage of our calories\n\n52:57.800 --> 52:59.600\n go to function our brain.\n\n53:00.800 --> 53:03.960\n No other species makes that big of a commitment.\n\n53:03.960 --> 53:06.840\n That has basically taken energetic changes\n\n53:06.840 --> 53:11.280\n for efficiency on the metabolic side for humanity\n\n53:11.280 --> 53:13.400\n to basically power that thing.\n\n53:13.400 --> 53:17.000\n And our brain is both enormously more efficient\n\n53:17.000 --> 53:20.480\n than other brains, but also, despite this efficiency,\n\n53:20.480 --> 53:22.320\n enormously more energy consuming.\n\n53:23.480 --> 53:27.000\n So, and if you look at just the sheer folds\n\n53:27.000 --> 53:30.400\n that the human brain has, again, our skull could only\n\n53:30.400 --> 53:32.720\n grow so much before it could no longer go\n\n53:32.720 --> 53:36.600\n through the pelvic opening and kill the mother\n\n53:36.600 --> 53:40.560\n at every birth, so, but yet the folds continued\n\n53:40.560 --> 53:43.720\n effectively creating just so much more capacity.\n\n53:43.720 --> 53:48.720\n The evolutionary context in which this was made\n\n53:48.720 --> 53:52.040\n is enormously fascinating, and it has to do with\n\n53:53.480 --> 53:55.680\n other humans that we have now killed off\n\n53:55.680 --> 53:57.480\n or that have gone extinct.\n\n53:57.480 --> 54:01.360\n And that has now created this weird place of humans\n\n54:01.360 --> 54:03.520\n on the planet as the only species\n\n54:03.520 --> 54:05.880\n that has this enormous hardware.\n\n54:05.880 --> 54:07.520\n So that can basically make us think\n\n54:07.520 --> 54:09.200\n that there's something very weird and unique\n\n54:09.200 --> 54:11.080\n that happened in human evolution that perhaps\n\n54:11.080 --> 54:13.640\n has not been recreated elsewhere. Maybe the asteroid\n\n54:13.640 --> 54:15.920\n didn't hit, you know, sister earth,\n\n54:15.920 --> 54:19.400\n and dinosaurs are still ruling, and, you know,\n\n54:19.400 --> 54:21.120\n any kind of proto human is squished\n\n54:21.120 --> 54:22.960\n and eaten for breakfast basically.\n\n54:25.440 --> 54:28.640\n However, we're not as unique as we like to think\n\n54:28.640 --> 54:30.720\n because there was this enormous diversity\n\n54:30.720 --> 54:33.040\n of other human like forms.\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:35.720\n And once you make it to that stage where you have\n\n54:35.720 --> 54:38.760\n a neocortex like explosion of, wow, we're not\n\n54:38.760 --> 54:41.200\n competing on intelligence, and we're not competing\n\n54:41.200 --> 54:43.080\n on social structures, and we're not competing\n\n54:43.080 --> 54:47.840\n on larger and larger groups, and being able to\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:51.880\n coordinate and being able to have empathy,\n\n54:51.880 --> 54:55.280\n the concept of empathy, the concept of an ego,\n\n54:55.280 --> 54:58.640\n the concept of a self, of self awareness,\n\n54:58.640 --> 55:03.640\n comes probably from being able to project\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:06.520\n another person's intentions,\n\n55:06.520 --> 55:10.000\n another person's intentions to understand\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:13.480\n what they mean when you have these large cognitive groups,\n\n55:13.480 --> 55:15.160\n large social groups.\n\n55:15.160 --> 55:19.080\n So me being able to sort of create a mental model\n\n55:19.080 --> 55:22.520\n of how you think may have come before I was able\n\n55:22.520 --> 55:26.360\n to create a personal mental model of how do I think.\n\n55:26.360 --> 55:30.680\n So this introspection probably came after this sort\n\n55:30.680 --> 55:34.640\n of projection and this empathy, which basically means,\n\n55:34.640 --> 55:37.720\n you know, passion, pathos, suffering,\n\n55:37.720 --> 55:39.120\n but basically sensing.\n\n55:39.120 --> 55:42.600\n So basically empathy means feeling what you're feeling,\n\n55:42.600 --> 55:45.320\n trying to project your emotional state\n\n55:45.320 --> 55:47.520\n onto my cognitive apparatus.\n\n55:47.520 --> 55:51.360\n And I think that is what eventually led\n\n55:51.360 --> 55:55.240\n to this enormous cognitive explosion\n\n55:55.240 --> 55:56.680\n that happened in humanity.\n\n55:56.680 --> 56:01.680\n So, you know, life itself in my view is inevitable\n\n56:02.840 --> 56:03.680\n on every planet.\n\n56:03.680 --> 56:05.480\n Inevitable. Inevitable.\n\n56:05.480 --> 56:09.920\n But the evolution of life to self awareness and cognition\n\n56:09.920 --> 56:12.680\n and all the incredible things that humans have done,\n\n56:12.680 --> 56:14.600\n you know, that might not be as inevitable.\n\n56:14.600 --> 56:15.440\n That's your intuition.\n\n56:15.440 --> 56:20.440\n So if you were to sort of estimate and bet some money on it,\n\n56:20.640 --> 56:24.920\n if we reran Earth a million times,\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:29.520\n would what we got now be the most special thing\n\n56:29.520 --> 56:30.960\n and how often would it be?\n\n56:30.960 --> 56:34.760\n So scientifically speaking, how repeatable is this experiment?\n\n56:36.240 --> 56:38.640\n So this whole cognitive revolution?\n\n56:38.640 --> 56:39.480\n Yes.\n\n56:40.520 --> 56:41.920\n Maybe not.\n\n56:41.920 --> 56:42.760\n Maybe not.\n\n56:42.760 --> 56:47.640\n Basically, I feel that the longevity of, you know,\n\n56:47.640 --> 56:51.880\n dinosaurs suggests that it was not quite inevitable\n\n56:51.880 --> 56:56.680\n that we humans eventually made it.\n\n56:56.680 --> 56:59.200\n What you're also implying one thing here.\n\n56:59.200 --> 57:01.120\n You're saying, you're implying that humans\n\n57:01.120 --> 57:03.320\n also don't have this longevity.\n\n57:03.320 --> 57:05.000\n This is the interesting question.\n\n57:05.000 --> 57:09.480\n So with the Fermi Paradox, the idea that the basic question\n\n57:09.480 --> 57:14.360\n is like, if the universe has a lot of alien life forms in it,\n\n57:14.360 --> 57:16.440\n why haven't we seen them?\n\n57:16.440 --> 57:19.320\n And one thought is that there's a great filter\n\n57:19.320 --> 57:23.600\n or multiple great filters that basically would destroy\n\n57:23.600 --> 57:24.880\n intelligent civilizations.\n\n57:24.880 --> 57:28.560\n Like this thing that we, you know, this multifolding brain\n\n57:28.560 --> 57:32.080\n that keeps growing may not be such a big feature.\n\n57:32.080 --> 57:34.200\n It might be useful for survival,\n\n57:34.200 --> 57:38.400\n but it like takes us down a side road\n\n57:38.400 --> 57:41.120\n that is a very short one with a quick dead end.\n\n57:41.120 --> 57:42.160\n What do you think about that?\n\n57:42.160 --> 57:45.560\n So I think the universe is enormous,\n\n57:45.560 --> 57:48.240\n not just in space, but also in time.\n\n57:50.040 --> 57:55.040\n And the pretense that, you know, the last blink\n\n57:55.040 --> 57:58.760\n of an instant that we've been able to send radio waves\n\n57:58.760 --> 58:00.320\n is when somebody should have been paying attention\n\n58:00.320 --> 58:02.920\n to our planet is a little ridiculous.\n\n58:03.840 --> 58:07.200\n So my, you know, what I love about Star Wars\n\n58:07.200 --> 58:10.720\n is a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n58:10.720 --> 58:11.880\n It's not like some distant future.\n\n58:11.880 --> 58:13.480\n It's a long, long time ago.\n\n58:13.480 --> 58:15.960\n What I love about it is that basically says,\n\n58:15.960 --> 58:19.360\n you know, evolution and civilization\n\n58:19.360 --> 58:23.760\n are just so recent in, you know, on earth.\n\n58:23.760 --> 58:25.080\n Like there's countless other planets\n\n58:25.080 --> 58:27.720\n that have probably all kinds of life forms,\n\n58:27.720 --> 58:30.400\n multicellular perhaps, and so on and so forth.\n\n58:31.560 --> 58:35.840\n But the fact that humanity has only been listening\n\n58:35.840 --> 58:39.360\n and emitting for just this tiny little blink\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:42.800\n means that any of these, you know, alien civilizations\n\n58:42.800 --> 58:44.080\n would need to be paying attention\n\n58:44.080 --> 58:47.160\n to every single insignificant planet out there.\n\n58:47.160 --> 58:50.320\n And, you know, again, I mean, the movie Contact\n\n58:50.320 --> 58:52.360\n and the book is just so beautiful.\n\n58:52.360 --> 58:56.160\n This whole concept of we don't need to travel physically.\n\n58:56.160 --> 58:57.680\n We can travel as light.\n\n58:57.680 --> 59:01.000\n We can send instructions for people to create machines\n\n59:01.000 --> 59:03.080\n that will allow us to beam down light\n\n59:03.080 --> 59:04.840\n and recreate ourselves.\n\n59:04.840 --> 59:07.480\n And in the book, you know, the aliens actually take over.\n\n59:07.480 --> 59:09.800\n They're not as friendly.\n\n59:09.800 --> 59:13.520\n But, you know, this concept that we have to eventually\n\n59:13.520 --> 59:14.720\n go and conquer every planet.\n\n59:14.720 --> 59:16.640\n I mean, I think that, yes,\n\n59:16.640 --> 59:18.560\n we will become a galactic species.\n\n59:18.560 --> 59:22.440\n So you have a hope, well, you said think, so.\n\n59:22.440 --> 59:23.280\n Oh, of course, of course.\n\n59:23.280 --> 59:25.840\n I mean, now that we've made it so far.\n\n59:25.840 --> 59:27.200\n So you feel like we've made it.\n\n59:27.200 --> 59:30.080\n Oh gosh, I feel that, you know, cognition,\n\n59:30.080 --> 59:31.760\n the cognition as an evolutionary trait\n\n59:31.760 --> 59:33.800\n has won over in our planet.\n\n59:33.800 --> 59:35.320\n There's no doubt that we've made it.\n\n59:35.320 --> 59:40.240\n So basically humans have won the battle for, you know,\n\n59:40.240 --> 59:41.360\n dominance.\n\n59:41.360 --> 59:43.760\n It wasn't necessarily the case with dinosaurs.\n\n59:43.760 --> 59:46.120\n Like, I mean, yes, you know,\n\n59:46.120 --> 59:50.360\n there's some claims of intelligence.\n\n59:50.360 --> 59:53.800\n And if you look at Jurassic Park, yeah, sure, whatever.\n\n59:53.800 --> 59:56.920\n But, you know, they just don't have the hardware for it.\n\n59:58.000 --> 59:59.280\n And humans have the hardware.\n\n59:59.280 --> 1:00:01.360\n There's no doubt that mammals have\n\n1:00:01.360 --> 1:00:03.640\n a dramatically improved hardware\n\n1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:06.080\n for cognition over dinosaurs.\n\n1:00:06.080 --> 1:00:09.440\n Like basically there's universes where strength won out.\n\n1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:11.640\n And in our planet, in our, you know,\n\n1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:15.560\n particular version of whatever happened in this planet,\n\n1:00:15.560 --> 1:00:16.920\n cognition won out.\n\n1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:18.000\n And it's kind of cool.\n\n1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.480\n I mean, it's a privilege, right?\n\n1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:22.000\n It's kind of like living in Boston instead of,\n\n1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.560\n I don't know, some middle age place\n\n1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:28.040\n where everybody's like hitting each other\n\n1:00:28.040 --> 1:00:31.120\n with, you know, weapons and sticks.\n\n1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:33.640\n You're back to the Lucky Ones song.\n\n1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:36.040\n I mean, we are the lucky ones.\n\n1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:39.600\n But the flip side of that is that this hardware\n\n1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:41.600\n also allows us to develop weapons\n\n1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:43.840\n and methods of destroying ourselves.\n\n1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:46.840\n Again, I want to go back to Pinker\n\n1:00:46.840 --> 1:00:49.520\n and the better angels of our nature.\n\n1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.960\n The whole concept that civilization\n\n1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:57.040\n and the act of civilizing\n\n1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:02.040\n has dramatically reduced violence, dramatically.\n\n1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:05.320\n If you look, you know, at every scale,\n\n1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:07.880\n as soon as organization comes,\n\n1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:12.880\n the state basically owns the right to violence.\n\n1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:17.520\n And eventually the state gives that right\n\n1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.400\n of governance to the people,\n\n1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:23.400\n but violence has been eliminated by that state.\n\n1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:27.080\n So this whole concept of central governance\n\n1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:28.880\n and people agreeing to live together\n\n1:01:29.760 --> 1:01:33.960\n and share responsibilities and duties\n\n1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:36.760\n and, you know, all of that\n\n1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:41.520\n is something that has led so much to less violence,\n\n1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:45.720\n less death, less suffering, less, you know, poverty,\n\n1:01:45.720 --> 1:01:48.720\n less, you know, war.\n\n1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.520\n I mean, yes, we have the capability to destroy ourselves,\n\n1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:56.520\n but the arc of civilization\n\n1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.680\n has led to much, much less destruction,\n\n1:01:58.680 --> 1:02:00.840\n much, much less war and much more peace.\n\n1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.000\n And of course there's blips back and forth\n\n1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.400\n and, you know, there are setbacks,\n\n1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:10.200\n but again, the moral arc of the universe.\n\n1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:13.280\n But it seems to just, I probably imagine\n\n1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:14.960\n there were two dinosaurs back in the day\n\n1:02:14.960 --> 1:02:17.080\n having this exact conversation\n\n1:02:17.080 --> 1:02:18.600\n and they look up to the sky\n\n1:02:18.600 --> 1:02:21.200\n and there seems to be something like an asteroid\n\n1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:22.040\n going towards Earth.\n\n1:02:22.040 --> 1:02:24.760\n So it's, while it's very true\n\n1:02:24.760 --> 1:02:28.520\n that the arc of our society of human civilization\n\n1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:31.480\n seems to be progressing towards a better, better life\n\n1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:34.860\n for everybody in the many ways that you described,\n\n1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:39.160\n things can change in a moment.\n\n1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:41.620\n And it feels like it's not just us humans\n\n1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:44.160\n we're living through a pandemic.\n\n1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:47.960\n You could imagine that a pandemic would be more destructive\n\n1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:52.540\n or there could be asteroids that just appear\n\n1:02:52.540 --> 1:02:54.480\n out of the darkness of space,\n\n1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:57.760\n which I recently learned it's not that easy\n\n1:02:57.760 --> 1:02:59.920\n to actually detect them.\n\n1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:00.760\n Yes.\n\n1:03:00.760 --> 1:03:02.960\n So 48, what happens in 48 years?\n\n1:03:04.620 --> 1:03:05.460\n I'm not sure.\n\n1:03:05.460 --> 1:03:07.000\n 2068, Apophis.\n\n1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.600\n There's an asteroid that's coming.\n\n1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:11.560\n In 48 years, it has very high chance\n\n1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.560\n of actually wiping us out completely.\n\n1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:14.400\n Yes.\n\n1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:15.240\n Yes.\n\n1:03:15.240 --> 1:03:18.580\n So we have 48 years to get our act together.\n\n1:03:18.580 --> 1:03:21.040\n It's not like some distant, distant hypothesis.\n\n1:03:21.040 --> 1:03:21.880\n Yes.\n\n1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:23.120\n Like, yeah, sure, they're hard to detect\n\n1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.280\n but this one we know about, it's coming.\n\n1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:26.240\n So how do you feel about that?\n\n1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:27.200\n Why are you still so optimistic?\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.840\n Oh gosh, I'm so happy with where we are now.\n\n1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:30.880\n This is gonna be great.\n\n1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:32.760\n Seriously, if you look at progress,\n\n1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:36.880\n if you look at, again, the speed with which knowledge\n\n1:03:36.880 --> 1:03:40.760\n has been transferred, what has led to humanity\n\n1:03:40.760 --> 1:03:43.280\n making so many advances so fast?\n\n1:03:43.280 --> 1:03:44.360\n Okay.\n\n1:03:44.360 --> 1:03:47.560\n So what has led to humanity making so many advances\n\n1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:50.360\n is not just the hardware upgrades,\n\n1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:52.600\n it's also the software upgrades.\n\n1:03:52.600 --> 1:03:55.520\n So by hardware upgrades, I basically mean our neocortex\n\n1:03:55.520 --> 1:03:57.320\n and the expansion and these layers\n\n1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:00.300\n and folds of our brain and all of that.\n\n1:04:00.300 --> 1:04:01.380\n That's the hardware.\n\n1:04:01.380 --> 1:04:03.360\n The software hasn't,\n\n1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:06.600\n you know, the hardware hasn't changed much\n\n1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:08.420\n in the last, what, 70,000 years.\n\n1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:12.000\n As I mentioned last time,\n\n1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.580\n if you take a person from ancient Egypt\n\n1:04:13.580 --> 1:04:18.020\n and you bring them up now, they're just as equally fit.\n\n1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:20.520\n So hardware hasn't changed.\n\n1:04:20.520 --> 1:04:22.480\n What has changed is software.\n\n1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:27.480\n What has changed is that we are growing up in societies\n\n1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:30.920\n that are much more complex.\n\n1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:33.840\n This whole concept of neoteny basically allows\n\n1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:35.800\n our exponential growth.\n\n1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:39.160\n The concept that our brain has not fully formed,\n\n1:04:39.160 --> 1:04:43.620\n has not fully stabilized itself until after our teenage years.\n\n1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:46.680\n So we basically have a good 16 years, 18 years\n\n1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:48.920\n to sort of infuse it with the latest\n\n1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:51.240\n and greatest in software.\n\n1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:53.920\n If you look at what happened in ancient Greece,\n\n1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:57.420\n why did everything explode at once?\n\n1:04:57.420 --> 1:04:59.720\n My take on this is that it was the shift\n\n1:04:59.720 --> 1:05:03.560\n from the Egyptian and hieroglyphic software\n\n1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:05.720\n to the Greek language software.\n\n1:05:06.600 --> 1:05:10.000\n This whole concept of creating abstract notions,\n\n1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:15.000\n of creating these layers of cognition\n\n1:05:16.720 --> 1:05:19.560\n and layers of meaning and layers of abstraction\n\n1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:24.560\n for words and ideals and beauty and harmony.\n\n1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:26.880\n How do you write harmony in hieroglyphics?\n\n1:05:26.880 --> 1:05:28.300\n There's no such thing as, you know,\n\n1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:31.600\n sort of expressing these ideals of peace and justice\n\n1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:34.440\n and, you know, these concepts of,\n\n1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:39.440\n or even, you know, macabre concepts of doom, et cetera.\n\n1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:42.200\n You don't have the language for it.\n\n1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:47.200\n Your brain has trouble getting at that concept.\n\n1:05:48.360 --> 1:05:53.200\n So what I'm trying to say is that these software upgrades\n\n1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:57.000\n for human language, human culture,\n\n1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:00.160\n human environment, human education\n\n1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:04.760\n have basically led to this enormous explosion of knowledge.\n\n1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:07.240\n And eventually after the enlightenment,\n\n1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:11.360\n and as I was mentioning the 42 line Bible\n\n1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:13.800\n and the printed press, the dissemination of knowledge,\n\n1:06:13.800 --> 1:06:17.120\n you basically now have this whole horizontal dispersion\n\n1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:21.360\n of ideas in addition to the vertical inheritance of genes.\n\n1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.040\n So the hardware improvements happen\n\n1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:25.520\n through vertical inheritance.\n\n1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:27.060\n The software improvements happen\n\n1:06:27.060 --> 1:06:28.760\n through horizontal inheritance.\n\n1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:31.400\n And the reason why human civilization exploded\n\n1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:32.720\n is not a hardware change anymore,\n\n1:06:32.720 --> 1:06:34.600\n it's really a software change.\n\n1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:37.260\n So if you're looking at now where we are today,\n\n1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:40.520\n look at coronavirus.\n\n1:06:40.520 --> 1:06:43.360\n Yes, sure, it could have killed us a hundred years ago,\n\n1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:45.600\n it would have, but it didn't.\n\n1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:46.440\n Why?\n\n1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:51.000\n Because in January, we published the genome.\n\n1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.020\n A month later, less than a month later,\n\n1:06:53.020 --> 1:06:54.960\n the first vaccine designs were done.\n\n1:06:54.960 --> 1:06:58.240\n And now less than a year later, 10 months later,\n\n1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:01.240\n we already have a working vaccine that's 90% efficient.\n\n1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:03.760\n I mean, that is ridiculous by any standards.\n\n1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:06.000\n And the reason is sharing.\n\n1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.460\n So the asteroid, yes, could wipe us out in 48 years,\n\n1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:11.040\n but 48 years?\n\n1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:16.040\n I mean, look at where we were 48 years ago, technologically.\n\n1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:18.420\n I mean, how much more we understand\n\n1:07:18.420 --> 1:07:23.020\n the basic foundations of space is enormous.\n\n1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:27.360\n The technological revolutions of digitization,\n\n1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:29.900\n the amount of compute power we can put\n\n1:07:29.900 --> 1:07:34.900\n on any nail size hardware is enormous.\n\n1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:40.580\n And this is nowhere near ending.\n\n1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:43.820\n We all have our little problems going back and forth\n\n1:07:43.820 --> 1:07:46.240\n on the social side and on the political side,\n\n1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:50.600\n on the sort of human side and the societal side,\n\n1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:54.120\n but science has not slowed down.\n\n1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:57.400\n Science is moving at a breakneck pace ahead.\n\n1:07:57.400 --> 1:08:00.640\n So, you know, Elon is now putting rockets out\n\n1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:01.700\n from the private space.\n\n1:08:01.700 --> 1:08:06.080\n I mean, that now democratization of space exploration\n\n1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:07.920\n is, you know, gonna revolutionize everything.\n\n1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:09.800\n It's gonna explode, continue.\n\n1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:12.600\n In the same way that every technology has exploded,\n\n1:08:12.600 --> 1:08:15.940\n this is the shift to space technology exploding.\n\n1:08:15.940 --> 1:08:19.360\n So 48 years is infinity from now\n\n1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.300\n in terms of space capabilities.\n\n1:08:21.300 --> 1:08:22.640\n So I'm not worried at all.\n\n1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.840\n Are you excited by the possibility of a human,\n\n1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.440\n well, one, a human stepping foot on Mars\n\n1:08:28.440 --> 1:08:33.060\n and two, possible colonization of not necessarily Mars,\n\n1:08:33.060 --> 1:08:34.840\n but other planets and all that kind of stuff\n\n1:08:34.840 --> 1:08:36.120\n for people living in space?\n\n1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:37.120\n Inevitable.\n\n1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:38.320\n Inevitable. Inevitable.\n\n1:08:38.320 --> 1:08:39.160\n Would you do it?\n\n1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:41.520\n Or do you kind of like Earth? Of course, of course.\n\n1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:42.360\n You know, how many?\n\n1:08:42.360 --> 1:08:44.000\n How many people will you wait?\n\n1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:46.080\n Will you wait for, I think it was about\n\n1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:50.000\n when the Declaration of Independence was signed,\n\n1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.560\n about two to three million people lived here.\n\n1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:54.440\n So would you move like before?\n\n1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:57.000\n Would you be like on the first boat?\n\n1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.300\n Would you be on the 10th boat?\n\n1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:00.480\n Would you wait until the Declaration of Independence?\n\n1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:02.120\n I don't think I'll be on the short list\n\n1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:04.000\n because I'll be old by then.\n\n1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.120\n They'll probably get a bunch of younger people.\n\n1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:09.760\n But you're, it's the wisdom and the,\n\n1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:12.000\n then again, you are the lucky one.\n\n1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.640\n But wisdom can be transferred horizontally.\n\n1:09:13.640 --> 1:09:15.240\n I gotta tell you, you are the lucky one.\n\n1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:16.200\n So you might be on the list.\n\n1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.040\n I don't know.\n\n1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.320\n I mean, I kind of feel like I would love\n\n1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:23.840\n to see Earth from above, just to watch our planet.\n\n1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:25.560\n I mean, just, I mean, you know,\n\n1:09:25.560 --> 1:09:29.360\n you can watch a live feed of the space station.\n\n1:09:29.360 --> 1:09:32.640\n Watching Earth is magnificent,\n\n1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:35.840\n like this blue tiny little shield.\n\n1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:38.040\n It's so thin, our atmosphere.\n\n1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:39.180\n Like if you drive to New York,\n\n1:09:39.180 --> 1:09:40.560\n you're basically in outer space.\n\n1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:41.480\n I mean, it's ridiculous.\n\n1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:42.520\n It's just so thin.\n\n1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:45.060\n And it's just, again, such a privilege\n\n1:09:45.060 --> 1:09:47.300\n to be on this planet, such a privilege.\n\n1:09:47.300 --> 1:09:52.300\n But I think our species is in for big, good things.\n\n1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:56.340\n I think that, you know,\n\n1:09:56.340 --> 1:09:58.820\n we will overcome our little problems\n\n1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:01.420\n and eventually come together as a species.\n\n1:10:01.420 --> 1:10:04.380\n I feel that we're definitely on the path to that.\n\n1:10:04.380 --> 1:10:07.900\n And, you know, it's just not permeated\n\n1:10:07.900 --> 1:10:09.660\n through the whole universe yet.\n\n1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:11.260\n I mean, through the whole world yet,\n\n1:10:11.260 --> 1:10:12.580\n through the whole Earth yet,\n\n1:10:12.580 --> 1:10:14.260\n but it's definitely permeating.\n\n1:10:15.380 --> 1:10:17.680\n So you've talked about humans as special.\n\n1:10:18.860 --> 1:10:23.860\n How exactly are we special relative to the dinosaurs?\n\n1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:27.520\n So I mentioned that there's, you know,\n\n1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:31.720\n this dramatic cognitive improvement that we've made,\n\n1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:34.000\n but I think it goes much deeper than that.\n\n1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:38.740\n So if you look at a lion attacking a gazelle\n\n1:10:38.740 --> 1:10:40.980\n in the middle of the Serengeti,\n\n1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:45.660\n the lion is smelling the molecules in the environment.\n\n1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:50.660\n Its hormones and neuro receptors\n\n1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:53.500\n are sort of getting it ready for impulse.\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:58.420\n The target is constantly looking around and sensing.\n\n1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:02.980\n I've actually been in Kenya and I've kind of seen the hunt.\n\n1:11:02.980 --> 1:11:07.220\n So I've kind of seen the sort of game of waiting\n\n1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:12.220\n and the mitochondria in the muscles of the lion\n\n1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:18.340\n are basically ready for, you know, jumping.\n\n1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:21.500\n They're expensing an enormous amount of energy.\n\n1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:23.500\n The grass as it's flowing\n\n1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:28.500\n is constantly transforming solar energy into chloroplasts,\n\n1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:32.160\n you know, through the chloroplast into energy,\n\n1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:34.620\n which eventually feeds the gazelle\n\n1:11:34.620 --> 1:11:36.940\n and eventually feeds the lions.\n\n1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:37.860\n And so on and so forth.\n\n1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:42.860\n So as humans, we experience all of that,\n\n1:11:44.360 --> 1:11:48.340\n but the lion only experiences one layer.\n\n1:11:49.580 --> 1:11:51.100\n The mitochondria in its body\n\n1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:52.500\n are only experiencing one layer.\n\n1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.540\n The chloroplasts are only experiencing one layer.\n\n1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:59.780\n The, you know, photoreceptors and the smell receptors\n\n1:11:59.780 --> 1:12:00.620\n and the chemical receptors,\n\n1:12:00.620 --> 1:12:02.820\n like the lion always attacks against the wind\n\n1:12:02.820 --> 1:12:04.060\n so that it's not smelled.\n\n1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:09.060\n Like all of these things are one layer at a time.\n\n1:12:11.140 --> 1:12:14.740\n And we humans somehow perceive the whole stack.\n\n1:12:14.740 --> 1:12:17.060\n So going back to software infrastructure\n\n1:12:17.060 --> 1:12:18.660\n and hardware infrastructure,\n\n1:12:18.660 --> 1:12:20.620\n if you design a computer,\n\n1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:23.260\n you basically have a physical layer that you start with.\n\n1:12:23.260 --> 1:12:24.820\n And then on top of that physical layer,\n\n1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:27.300\n you have, you know, the electrical layer.\n\n1:12:27.300 --> 1:12:28.660\n And on top of the electrical layer,\n\n1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.660\n you have basically gates and logic and an assembly layer.\n\n1:12:32.660 --> 1:12:33.700\n And on top of the assembly layer,\n\n1:12:33.700 --> 1:12:36.500\n you have your, you know, higher order,\n\n1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:37.660\n higher level programming.\n\n1:12:37.660 --> 1:12:38.500\n And on top of that,\n\n1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:40.180\n you have your deep learning routine, et cetera.\n\n1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:41.020\n And on top of that,\n\n1:12:41.020 --> 1:12:44.780\n you eventually build a cognitive system that's smart.\n\n1:12:46.060 --> 1:12:49.540\n I want you to now picture this cognitive system\n\n1:12:49.540 --> 1:12:51.900\n becoming not just self aware,\n\n1:12:53.380 --> 1:12:56.860\n but also becoming aware of the hardware that it's made of\n\n1:12:57.820 --> 1:13:01.180\n and the atoms that it's made of and so on and so forth.\n\n1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:03.700\n So it's as if your AI system,\n\n1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:08.580\n and there's this beautiful scene in 2001 Odyssey of Space,\n\n1:13:08.580 --> 1:13:13.060\n where Hull, after Dave starts disconnecting him,\n\n1:13:13.060 --> 1:13:17.700\n is starting to sing a song about daisies, et cetera.\n\n1:13:17.700 --> 1:13:22.700\n And Hull is basically saying, Dave, I'm losing my mind.\n\n1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:26.500\n I can feel I'm losing my mind.\n\n1:13:26.500 --> 1:13:28.140\n It's just so beautiful.\n\n1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:31.620\n This concept of self awareness of knowing\n\n1:13:31.620 --> 1:13:35.300\n that the hardware is no longer there is amazing.\n\n1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:39.100\n And in the same way humans who have had accidents\n\n1:13:39.100 --> 1:13:42.100\n are aware that they've had accidents.\n\n1:13:42.100 --> 1:13:44.260\n So there's this self awareness of AI\n\n1:13:45.300 --> 1:13:49.300\n that is, you know, this beautiful concept about,\n\n1:13:49.300 --> 1:13:52.780\n you know, sort of the eventual cognitive leap\n\n1:13:52.780 --> 1:13:54.620\n to self awareness.\n\n1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:57.260\n But imagine now the AI system\n\n1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.540\n actually breaking through these layers\n\n1:13:58.540 --> 1:13:59.380\n and saying, wait a minute,\n\n1:13:59.380 --> 1:14:01.860\n I think I can design a slightly better hardware\n\n1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:03.460\n to get me functioning better.\n\n1:14:03.460 --> 1:14:05.740\n And that's what basically humans are doing.\n\n1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:08.460\n So if you look at our reasoning layer,\n\n1:14:08.460 --> 1:14:11.220\n it's built on top of a cognitive layer.\n\n1:14:11.220 --> 1:14:13.420\n And the reasoning layer we share with AI,\n\n1:14:13.420 --> 1:14:14.500\n it's kind of cool.\n\n1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:16.540\n Like there is another thing on the planet\n\n1:14:16.540 --> 1:14:19.420\n that can integrate equations and it's manmade,\n\n1:14:19.420 --> 1:14:22.140\n but we share computation with them.\n\n1:14:22.140 --> 1:14:24.860\n We share this cognitive layer of playing chess.\n\n1:14:24.860 --> 1:14:26.580\n We're not alone anymore.\n\n1:14:26.580 --> 1:14:28.460\n We're not the only thing on the planet that plays chess.\n\n1:14:28.460 --> 1:14:31.300\n Now we have AI that also plays chess.\n\n1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.780\n But in some sense that that particular organism,\n\n1:14:33.780 --> 1:14:36.300\n AI as it is now only operates in that layer.\n\n1:14:36.300 --> 1:14:37.340\n Exactly.\n\n1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:38.180\n Exactly.\n\n1:14:38.180 --> 1:14:40.180\n And then most animals operate\n\n1:14:40.180 --> 1:14:43.820\n in the sort of cognitive layer that we're all experiencing.\n\n1:14:43.820 --> 1:14:48.060\n A bat is doing this incredible integration of signals,\n\n1:14:48.060 --> 1:14:50.020\n but it's not aware of it.\n\n1:14:50.020 --> 1:14:55.020\n It's basically constantly sending echo location waves\n\n1:14:55.020 --> 1:14:56.580\n and it's receiving them back.\n\n1:14:56.580 --> 1:14:58.780\n And multiple bats in the same cave\n\n1:14:58.780 --> 1:15:01.340\n are operating at slightly different frequencies\n\n1:15:01.340 --> 1:15:03.380\n and with slightly different pulses.\n\n1:15:03.380 --> 1:15:04.860\n And they're all sensing objects\n\n1:15:04.860 --> 1:15:07.020\n and they're doing motion planning\n\n1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:08.460\n in their cognitive hardware,\n\n1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:10.380\n but they're not even aware of all of that.\n\n1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:13.500\n All they know is that they have a 3D view of space\n\n1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:17.020\n around them, just like any gazelle walking through,\n\n1:15:17.020 --> 1:15:18.620\n you know, the desert.\n\n1:15:18.620 --> 1:15:23.220\n And any baby looking around is aware of things\n\n1:15:23.220 --> 1:15:26.540\n without doing the math of how am I processing\n\n1:15:26.540 --> 1:15:28.580\n all of these visual information, et cetera.\n\n1:15:28.580 --> 1:15:31.500\n You're just aware of the layer that you live in.\n\n1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:35.740\n I think if you look at this, at humanity,\n\n1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:38.740\n we've basically managed through our cognitive layer,\n\n1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:41.660\n through our perception layer, through our senses layer,\n\n1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:46.660\n through our multi organ layer, through our genetic layer,\n\n1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:51.820\n through our molecular layer, through our atomic layer,\n\n1:15:51.820 --> 1:15:54.340\n through our quantum layer,\n\n1:15:54.340 --> 1:15:58.140\n through even the very fabric of the space time continuum\n\n1:15:58.140 --> 1:16:00.620\n unite all of that cognitively.\n\n1:16:00.620 --> 1:16:03.620\n So as we're watching that scene in the Serengeti,\n\n1:16:04.460 --> 1:16:07.300\n we as scientists, we as educated humans,\n\n1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:09.980\n we as, you know, anyone who's finished high school\n\n1:16:09.980 --> 1:16:12.060\n are aware of all of this beauty\n\n1:16:12.060 --> 1:16:14.700\n of all of these different layers interplaying together.\n\n1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:16.660\n And I think that's something very unique\n\n1:16:16.660 --> 1:16:20.100\n in perhaps not just the galaxy, but maybe even the cosmos.\n\n1:16:20.100 --> 1:16:25.100\n This species that has managed to in space\n\n1:16:25.980 --> 1:16:29.420\n cross through these layers from the enormous\n\n1:16:29.420 --> 1:16:30.780\n to the infinitely small.\n\n1:16:30.780 --> 1:16:33.140\n And that's what I love about particle physics.\n\n1:16:33.140 --> 1:16:35.780\n The fact that it actually unites everything.\n\n1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:36.620\n The very small and the very big.\n\n1:16:36.620 --> 1:16:38.020\n The very small and the very big.\n\n1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:39.300\n It's only through the very big\n\n1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.340\n that the very small gets formed.\n\n1:16:41.340 --> 1:16:43.100\n Like basically every atom of gold\n\n1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:47.860\n results from the fusion that happened\n\n1:16:47.860 --> 1:16:51.420\n of increasingly large particles before that explosion\n\n1:16:51.420 --> 1:16:53.620\n that then disperses it through the cosmos.\n\n1:16:53.620 --> 1:16:57.220\n And it's only through understanding the very large\n\n1:16:57.220 --> 1:16:59.540\n that we understand the very small and vice versa.\n\n1:16:59.540 --> 1:17:01.980\n And that's in space.\n\n1:17:01.980 --> 1:17:04.820\n Then there's the time direction.\n\n1:17:04.820 --> 1:17:08.660\n As you are watching the Kilimanjaro mountain,\n\n1:17:08.660 --> 1:17:11.660\n you can kind of look back through time\n\n1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:14.300\n to when that volcano was exploding\n\n1:17:14.300 --> 1:17:17.740\n and growing out of the tectonic forces.\n\n1:17:17.740 --> 1:17:20.420\n As you drive through Death Valley,\n\n1:17:20.420 --> 1:17:23.380\n you see these mountains on their side\n\n1:17:23.380 --> 1:17:27.020\n and these layers of history exposed.\n\n1:17:28.260 --> 1:17:33.260\n We are aware of the eons that have happened on earth\n\n1:17:34.380 --> 1:17:36.180\n and the tectonic movements on earth.\n\n1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:41.220\n The same way that we're aware of the Big Bang\n\n1:17:41.220 --> 1:17:44.620\n and the early evolution of the cosmos.\n\n1:17:44.620 --> 1:17:46.620\n And we can also see forward in time\n\n1:17:46.620 --> 1:17:48.380\n as to where the universe is heading.\n\n1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:53.340\n We can see Apophis in 2068 coming over,\n\n1:17:53.340 --> 1:17:54.340\n looking ahead in time.\n\n1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:58.780\n I mean, that would be magician stuff in ancient times.\n\n1:17:58.780 --> 1:18:02.420\n So what I love about humanity and its role in the universe\n\n1:18:02.420 --> 1:18:05.820\n is that if there's a God watching,\n\n1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:08.300\n he's like, finally, somebody figured it out.\n\n1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:10.460\n I've been building all these beautiful things\n\n1:18:10.460 --> 1:18:11.620\n and somebody can appreciate it.\n\n1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:13.780\n And figured me out from God's perspective,\n\n1:18:13.780 --> 1:18:16.980\n meaning become aware of, you know.\n\n1:18:16.980 --> 1:18:18.900\n Yeah, so it's kind of interesting\n\n1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:21.980\n to think of the world in this way as layers\n\n1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:25.380\n and us humans are able to convert those layers\n\n1:18:25.380 --> 1:18:29.940\n into ideas that you can then combine, right?\n\n1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:32.060\n So we're doing some kind of conversion.\n\n1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:33.500\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:35.220\n And last time you asked me about\n\n1:18:35.220 --> 1:18:37.660\n whether we live in a simulation, for example.\n\n1:18:37.660 --> 1:18:42.660\n I mean, realize that we are living in a simulation.\n\n1:18:42.660 --> 1:18:45.020\n We are, the reality that we're in\n\n1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.820\n without any sort of person programming this is a simulation.\n\n1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:51.660\n Like basically what happens inside your skull?\n\n1:18:51.660 --> 1:18:55.060\n There's this integration of sensory inputs\n\n1:18:55.060 --> 1:18:57.820\n which are translated into perceptory signals,\n\n1:18:57.820 --> 1:19:00.500\n which are then translated into a conceptual model\n\n1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:02.540\n of the world around you.\n\n1:19:02.540 --> 1:19:06.820\n And that exercise is happening seamlessly.\n\n1:19:06.820 --> 1:19:11.020\n And yet, you know, if you think about sort of, again,\n\n1:19:11.020 --> 1:19:15.180\n this whole simulation and Neo analogy,\n\n1:19:15.180 --> 1:19:18.380\n you can think of the reality that we live in as a matrix,\n\n1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:22.300\n as the matrix, but we've actually broken through the matrix.\n\n1:19:22.300 --> 1:19:23.940\n We've actually traversed the layers.\n\n1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:27.620\n We didn't have to take a pill, like we didn't, you know,\n\n1:19:27.620 --> 1:19:29.420\n Morpheus didn't have to show up\n\n1:19:29.420 --> 1:19:31.820\n to basically give us the blue pill or the red pill.\n\n1:19:31.820 --> 1:19:35.900\n We were able to sufficiently evolve cognitively\n\n1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:37.780\n through the hardware explosion\n\n1:19:37.780 --> 1:19:41.180\n and sufficiently evolve scientifically\n\n1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:43.020\n through the software explosion\n\n1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:45.780\n to basically get at breaking through the matrix,\n\n1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:47.820\n realizing that we live in a matrix\n\n1:19:47.820 --> 1:19:51.220\n and realizing that we are this thing in there.\n\n1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:53.780\n And yet that thing in there has a consciousness\n\n1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:56.020\n that lives through all these layers.\n\n1:19:57.140 --> 1:19:58.500\n And I think we're the only species.\n\n1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:00.460\n We're the only thing that we even can think of\n\n1:20:00.460 --> 1:20:01.620\n that has actually done that,\n\n1:20:01.620 --> 1:20:09.780\n that has sort of permeated space and time scales\n\n1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:13.820\n and layers of abstraction plowing through them\n\n1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:16.940\n and realizing what we're really, really made of.\n\n1:20:16.940 --> 1:20:20.020\n And the next frontier is of course, cognition.\n\n1:20:20.020 --> 1:20:22.540\n So we understand so much of the cosmos,\n\n1:20:22.540 --> 1:20:24.340\n so much of the stuff around us,\n\n1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:28.060\n but the stuff inside here, finding the basis for the soul,\n\n1:20:28.060 --> 1:20:31.300\n finding the basis for the ego, for the self,\n\n1:20:31.300 --> 1:20:35.180\n the self awareness, when does the spark happen\n\n1:20:35.180 --> 1:20:38.820\n that basically sort of makes you you?\n\n1:20:38.820 --> 1:20:41.060\n I mean, that's really the next frontier.\n\n1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:44.980\n So in terms of these peeling off layers of complexity,\n\n1:20:44.980 --> 1:20:47.420\n somewhere between the cognitive layer\n\n1:20:47.420 --> 1:20:52.460\n and the reasoning layer or the computational layer,\n\n1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:54.460\n there's still some stuff to be figured out there.\n\n1:20:54.460 --> 1:20:56.020\n And I think that's the final frontier\n\n1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:59.020\n of sort of completing our journey through that matrix.\n\n1:20:59.020 --> 1:21:03.980\n And maybe duplicating it in other versions of ourselves\n\n1:21:03.980 --> 1:21:08.660\n through AI, which is another very exciting possibility.\n\n1:21:08.660 --> 1:21:12.700\n What I love about AI and the way that it operates right now\n\n1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:14.940\n is the fact that it is unpredictable.\n\n1:21:16.020 --> 1:21:18.380\n There's emergent behavior\n\n1:21:18.380 --> 1:21:22.260\n in our cognitively capable artificial systems\n\n1:21:23.660 --> 1:21:26.580\n that we can certainly model,\n\n1:21:26.580 --> 1:21:30.020\n but we don't encode directly.\n\n1:21:30.020 --> 1:21:32.500\n And that's a key difference.\n\n1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:35.460\n So we like to say, oh, of course,\n\n1:21:35.460 --> 1:21:38.900\n this is not really intelligent because we coded it up.\n\n1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:41.500\n And we've just put in these little parameters there\n\n1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:43.700\n and there's like six billion parameters\n\n1:21:43.700 --> 1:21:45.660\n and once you've learned them,\n\n1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:48.140\n we kind of understand the layers.\n\n1:21:48.140 --> 1:21:50.380\n But that's an oversimplification.\n\n1:21:50.380 --> 1:21:53.260\n It's like saying, oh, of course, humans,\n\n1:21:53.260 --> 1:21:55.580\n we understand humans, they're just made out of neurons\n\n1:21:55.580 --> 1:22:00.580\n and layers of cortex and there's a visual area.\n\n1:22:01.220 --> 1:22:04.140\n But every human is encoded\n\n1:22:04.140 --> 1:22:06.380\n by a ridiculously small number of genes\n\n1:22:06.380 --> 1:22:09.500\n compared to the complexity of our cognitive apparatus.\n\n1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:11.540\n 20,000 genes is really not that much\n\n1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:13.420\n out of which a tiny little fraction\n\n1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:16.340\n are in fact encoding all of our cognitive functions.\n\n1:22:16.340 --> 1:22:19.740\n The rest is emergent behavior.\n\n1:22:19.740 --> 1:22:24.740\n The rest is the cortical layers\n\n1:22:24.740 --> 1:22:27.460\n doing their thing in the same way\n\n1:22:27.460 --> 1:22:30.980\n that when we build these conversational systems\n\n1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:34.540\n or these cognitive systems or these deep learning systems,\n\n1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:36.100\n we put the architecture in place,\n\n1:22:36.100 --> 1:22:37.620\n but then they do their thing.\n\n1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:38.740\n And in some ways,\n\n1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:41.620\n that's creating something that has its own identity.\n\n1:22:41.620 --> 1:22:43.620\n That's creating something that's not just,\n\n1:22:43.620 --> 1:22:45.820\n oh yeah, it's not the early AI\n\n1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:47.100\n where if you hadn't programmed\n\n1:22:47.100 --> 1:22:49.140\n what happens in the grocery bags\n\n1:22:49.140 --> 1:22:52.980\n when you have both cold and hot and hard and soft,\n\n1:22:52.980 --> 1:22:54.540\n the system wouldn't know what to do.\n\n1:22:54.540 --> 1:22:57.660\n No, no, you basically now just program the primitives\n\n1:22:57.660 --> 1:22:59.460\n and then it learns from that.\n\n1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:01.220\n So even though the origins are humble,\n\n1:23:01.220 --> 1:23:03.340\n just like it is for our genetic code,\n\n1:23:03.340 --> 1:23:05.500\n for AI, even though the origins are humble,\n\n1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:10.500\n the result of it being deployed into the world\n\n1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:13.660\n is infinitely complex.\n\n1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:21.620\n And yet, it's not yet able to be cognizant\n\n1:23:21.620 --> 1:23:25.540\n of all the other layers of its,\n\n1:23:25.540 --> 1:23:30.540\n you know, it's not able to think about space and time.\n\n1:23:33.020 --> 1:23:35.780\n It's not able to think about the hardware in which it runs,\n\n1:23:35.780 --> 1:23:38.420\n the electricity in which it runs yet.\n\n1:23:38.420 --> 1:23:41.060\n So if you look at humans,\n\n1:23:41.060 --> 1:23:43.300\n we basically have the same cognitive architecture\n\n1:23:43.300 --> 1:23:45.660\n as monkeys, as the great apes.\n\n1:23:45.660 --> 1:23:48.220\n It's just a ton more of it.\n\n1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:52.180\n If you look at GPT3 versus GPT2,\n\n1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:55.460\n again, it's the same architecture, just more of it.\n\n1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:58.460\n And yet it's able to do so much more.\n\n1:23:58.460 --> 1:23:59.940\n So if you start thinking about sort of\n\n1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:03.100\n what's the future of that, GPT4 and GPT5,\n\n1:24:03.100 --> 1:24:05.340\n do you really need fundamentally different architectures\n\n1:24:05.340 --> 1:24:07.820\n or do you just need a ton more hardware?\n\n1:24:07.820 --> 1:24:10.340\n And we do have a ton more hardware.\n\n1:24:10.340 --> 1:24:12.580\n Like these systems are nowhere near\n\n1:24:12.580 --> 1:24:15.540\n what humans have between our ears.\n\n1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:19.300\n So, you know, there's something to be said\n\n1:24:19.300 --> 1:24:22.900\n about stay tuned for emergent behavior.\n\n1:24:22.900 --> 1:24:24.740\n We keep thinking that general intelligence\n\n1:24:24.740 --> 1:24:27.700\n might just be forever away,\n\n1:24:27.700 --> 1:24:29.820\n but it could just simply be that\n\n1:24:29.820 --> 1:24:31.860\n we just need a ton more hardware\n\n1:24:31.860 --> 1:24:33.620\n and that humans are just not that different\n\n1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:37.260\n from the great apes, except for just a ton more of it.\n\n1:24:37.260 --> 1:24:41.060\n Yeah, it's interesting that in the AI community,\n\n1:24:41.060 --> 1:24:43.540\n maybe there's a human centric fear,\n\n1:24:43.540 --> 1:24:48.540\n but the notion that GPT10 will achieve general intelligence\n\n1:24:49.980 --> 1:24:51.940\n is something that people shy away from,\n\n1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:54.300\n that there has to be something totally different\n\n1:24:54.300 --> 1:24:56.220\n and new added to this.\n\n1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:59.260\n And yet it's not seriously considered that\n\n1:25:01.100 --> 1:25:05.140\n this very simple thing, this very simple architecture,\n\n1:25:05.140 --> 1:25:07.460\n when scaled, might be the thing\n\n1:25:07.460 --> 1:25:09.100\n that achieves super intelligence.\n\n1:25:09.100 --> 1:25:11.580\n And people think the same way about humanity\n\n1:25:11.580 --> 1:25:13.180\n and human consciousness.\n\n1:25:13.180 --> 1:25:15.220\n They're like, oh, consciousness might be quantum,\n\n1:25:15.220 --> 1:25:18.220\n or it might be, you know, some nonphysical thing.\n\n1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:21.620\n And it's like, or it could just be a lot more\n\n1:25:21.620 --> 1:25:25.820\n of the same hardware that now is sufficiently capable\n\n1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:29.380\n of self awareness just because it has the neurons to do it.\n\n1:25:29.380 --> 1:25:32.780\n So maybe the consciousness that is so elusive\n\n1:25:33.660 --> 1:25:38.260\n is an emergent behavior of you basically string together\n\n1:25:38.260 --> 1:25:41.340\n all these cognitive capabilities that come from running,\n\n1:25:41.340 --> 1:25:43.260\n from seeing, for reacting,\n\n1:25:43.260 --> 1:25:45.620\n from predicting the movement of a fly\n\n1:25:45.620 --> 1:25:47.300\n as you're catching it through the air.\n\n1:25:47.300 --> 1:25:49.540\n All of these things are just like great lookup tables\n\n1:25:49.540 --> 1:25:51.420\n encoded in a giant neural network.\n\n1:25:51.420 --> 1:25:53.060\n I mean, I'm oversimplifying, of course,\n\n1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:55.540\n the complexity and the diversity of the different types\n\n1:25:55.540 --> 1:25:57.260\n of excitatory and inhibitory neurons,\n\n1:25:57.260 --> 1:25:59.860\n the wave forms that sort of shine through\n\n1:26:01.860 --> 1:26:04.740\n the connections across all these different layers,\n\n1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:06.900\n the amalgamation of signals, et cetera.\n\n1:26:06.900 --> 1:26:08.500\n The brain is enormously complex.\n\n1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:09.580\n I mean, of course.\n\n1:26:09.580 --> 1:26:11.580\n But again, it's a small number of primitives\n\n1:26:11.580 --> 1:26:14.260\n encoded by a tiny number of genes,\n\n1:26:14.260 --> 1:26:19.260\n which are self organized and shaped by their environment.\n\n1:26:21.140 --> 1:26:23.420\n Babies that are growing up today\n\n1:26:23.420 --> 1:26:28.420\n are listening to language from conception.\n\n1:26:28.460 --> 1:26:32.300\n Basically, as soon as the auditory apparatus forms,\n\n1:26:32.300 --> 1:26:35.100\n it's already getting shaped to the types of signals\n\n1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:37.180\n that are out in the real world today.\n\n1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:39.300\n So it's not just like, oh, have an Egyptian be born\n\n1:26:39.300 --> 1:26:40.540\n and then ship them over.\n\n1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:44.300\n It's like, no, that Egyptian would be listening in\n\n1:26:44.300 --> 1:26:46.420\n to the complexity of the world and then getting born\n\n1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:49.620\n and sort of seeing just how much more complex the world is.\n\n1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:53.940\n So it's a combination of the underlying hardware,\n\n1:26:53.940 --> 1:26:57.540\n which if you think about as a geneticist,\n\n1:26:57.540 --> 1:27:00.100\n in my view, the hardware gives you an upper bound\n\n1:27:00.100 --> 1:27:02.260\n of cognitive capabilities,\n\n1:27:02.260 --> 1:27:05.260\n but it's the environment that makes those capabilities shine\n\n1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:06.980\n and reach their maximum.\n\n1:27:06.980 --> 1:27:11.060\n So we're a combination of nature and nurture.\n\n1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:15.300\n The nature is our genes and our cognitive apparatus.\n\n1:27:15.300 --> 1:27:18.620\n And the nurture is the richness of the environment\n\n1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:22.140\n that makes that cognitive apparatus reach its potential.\n\n1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:27.140\n And we are so far from reaching our full potential, so far.\n\n1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:31.060\n I think that kids being born a hundred years from now,\n\n1:27:31.060 --> 1:27:33.500\n they'll be looking at us now and saying\n\n1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.500\n what primitive educational systems they had.\n\n1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:38.180\n I can't believe people were not wired\n\n1:27:38.180 --> 1:27:42.740\n into this virtual reality from birth as we are now,\n\n1:27:42.740 --> 1:27:46.180\n cause like they're clearly inferior and so on and so forth.\n\n1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:48.100\n I basically think that our environment\n\n1:27:48.100 --> 1:27:53.100\n will continue exploding and our cognitive capabilities,\n\n1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:55.220\n it's not like, oh, we're only using 10% of our brain.\n\n1:27:55.220 --> 1:27:56.060\n That's ridiculous.\n\n1:27:56.060 --> 1:27:57.660\n Of course, we're using 100% of our brain,\n\n1:27:57.660 --> 1:28:00.740\n but it's still constrained by how complex\n\n1:28:00.740 --> 1:28:02.140\n our environment is.\n\n1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:06.500\n So the hardware will remain the same, but the software,\n\n1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:08.740\n in a quickly advancing environment,\n\n1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:10.820\n the software will make a huge difference\n\n1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:14.340\n in the nature of like the human experience,\n\n1:28:14.340 --> 1:28:15.500\n the human condition.\n\n1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:17.500\n It's fascinating to think that humans will look\n\n1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.460\n very different a hundred years from now,\n\n1:28:19.460 --> 1:28:20.740\n just because the environment changed,\n\n1:28:20.740 --> 1:28:22.980\n even though we're still the same great apes,\n\n1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:25.420\n the descendant of apes.\n\n1:28:25.420 --> 1:28:28.660\n At the core of this is kind of a notion of ideas\n\n1:28:28.660 --> 1:28:31.020\n that I don't know if you're,\n\n1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:33.140\n there's a lot of people, including you,\n\n1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:34.940\n eloquently about this topic,\n\n1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:39.460\n but Richard Dawkins talks about the notion of memes\n\n1:28:39.460 --> 1:28:43.700\n and let's say this notion of ideas,\n\n1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:49.140\n multiplying, selecting in the minds of humans.\n\n1:28:49.140 --> 1:28:52.460\n Do you ever think about ideas from that perspective,\n\n1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:54.740\n ideas as organisms themselves\n\n1:28:54.740 --> 1:28:57.580\n that are breeding in the minds of humans?\n\n1:28:57.580 --> 1:28:59.540\n I love the concept of memes.\n\n1:28:59.540 --> 1:29:03.660\n I love the concept of these horizontal transfer of ideas\n\n1:29:03.660 --> 1:29:08.340\n and sort of permeating through our layer\n\n1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:11.140\n of interconnected neural networks.\n\n1:29:11.140 --> 1:29:15.140\n So you can think of sort of the cognitive space\n\n1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:17.100\n that has now connected all of humanity,\n\n1:29:18.020 --> 1:29:22.460\n where we are now one giant information\n\n1:29:22.460 --> 1:29:24.820\n and idea sharing network,\n\n1:29:24.820 --> 1:29:28.900\n well beyond what was thought to be ever capable\n\n1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:32.620\n when the concept of a meme was created by Richard Dawkins.\n\n1:29:32.620 --> 1:29:35.260\n So, but I wanna take that concept\n\n1:29:35.260 --> 1:29:39.260\n just into another twist,\n\n1:29:39.260 --> 1:29:44.260\n which is the horizontal transfer of humans with fellowships.\n\n1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:51.140\n And the fact that as people apply to MIT\n\n1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:53.100\n from around the world,\n\n1:29:53.100 --> 1:29:55.660\n there's a selection that happens,\n\n1:29:55.660 --> 1:29:58.220\n not just for their ideas,\n\n1:29:58.220 --> 1:30:00.620\n but also for the cognitive hardware\n\n1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:02.940\n that came up with those ideas.\n\n1:30:02.940 --> 1:30:05.260\n So we don't just ship ideas around anymore.\n\n1:30:05.260 --> 1:30:07.220\n They don't evolve in a vacuum.\n\n1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:11.020\n The ideas themselves influence the distribution\n\n1:30:11.020 --> 1:30:14.460\n of cognitive systems, i.e. humans and brains\n\n1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:15.500\n around the planet.\n\n1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:17.140\n Yeah, we ship them to different locations\n\n1:30:17.140 --> 1:30:18.340\n based on their properties.\n\n1:30:18.340 --> 1:30:19.620\n That's exactly right.\n\n1:30:19.620 --> 1:30:24.100\n So those cognitive systems that think of physics,\n\n1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.940\n for example, might go to CERN\n\n1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:28.300\n and those that think of genomics\n\n1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:30.460\n might go to the Broad Institute.\n\n1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:32.100\n And those that think of computer science\n\n1:30:32.100 --> 1:30:35.820\n might go to, I don't know, Stanford or CMU or MIT.\n\n1:30:35.820 --> 1:30:38.700\n And you basically have this co evolution now\n\n1:30:38.700 --> 1:30:40.980\n of memes and ideas\n\n1:30:40.980 --> 1:30:44.700\n and the cognitive conversational systems\n\n1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:47.220\n that love these ideas and feed on these ideas\n\n1:30:47.220 --> 1:30:50.140\n and understand these ideas and appreciate these ideas\n\n1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:52.060\n now coming together.\n\n1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:56.020\n So you basically have students coming to Boston to study\n\n1:30:56.020 --> 1:30:56.940\n because that's the place\n\n1:30:56.940 --> 1:30:59.300\n where these types of cognitive systems thrive.\n\n1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:05.620\n And they're selected based on their cognitive output\n\n1:31:05.620 --> 1:31:08.020\n and their idea output.\n\n1:31:08.020 --> 1:31:10.620\n But once they get into that place,\n\n1:31:10.620 --> 1:31:15.020\n the boiling and interbreeding of these memes\n\n1:31:15.020 --> 1:31:17.660\n becomes so much more frequent.\n\n1:31:17.660 --> 1:31:21.580\n That what comes out of it is so far beyond\n\n1:31:21.580 --> 1:31:23.980\n if ideas were evolving in a vacuum\n\n1:31:23.980 --> 1:31:25.860\n of an already established hardware,\n\n1:31:25.860 --> 1:31:28.540\n cognitive interconnection system of the planet,\n\n1:31:28.540 --> 1:31:32.820\n where now you basically have the ideas\n\n1:31:32.820 --> 1:31:35.100\n shaping the distribution of these systems.\n\n1:31:35.100 --> 1:31:37.700\n And then the genetics kick in as well.\n\n1:31:37.700 --> 1:31:40.060\n You basically have now these people\n\n1:31:40.060 --> 1:31:42.020\n who came to be a student kind of like myself\n\n1:31:42.020 --> 1:31:45.260\n who now stuck around and are now professors\n\n1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:49.900\n bringing up our own genetically encoded\n\n1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.300\n and genetically related cognitive systems,\n\n1:31:53.300 --> 1:31:56.100\n mine are eight, six and three years old,\n\n1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:58.020\n who are now growing up in an environment\n\n1:31:58.020 --> 1:32:02.460\n surrounded by other cognitive systems of a similar age\n\n1:32:02.460 --> 1:32:06.180\n with parents who love these types of thinking and ideas.\n\n1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:09.260\n And you basically have a whole interbreeding now\n\n1:32:09.260 --> 1:32:14.260\n of genetically selected transfer of cognitive systems\n\n1:32:14.260 --> 1:32:19.260\n where the genes and the memes are co evolving\n\n1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:23.300\n the same soup of ever improving knowledge\n\n1:32:23.300 --> 1:32:28.300\n and societal inter fertilization,\n\n1:32:28.300 --> 1:32:29.940\n cross fertilization of these ideas.\n\n1:32:29.940 --> 1:32:32.780\n So this beautiful image.\n\n1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:36.420\n So this is shipping these actual meat cognitive systems\n\n1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:37.580\n to physical locations.\n\n1:32:37.580 --> 1:32:41.660\n They tend to cluster in the biology ones,\n\n1:32:41.660 --> 1:32:45.340\n and the biology ones cluster in a certain building too.\n\n1:32:45.340 --> 1:32:49.540\n So like within that there's clusters on top of clusters,\n\n1:32:49.540 --> 1:32:50.380\n top of clusters.\n\n1:32:50.380 --> 1:32:52.740\n What about in the online world?\n\n1:32:52.740 --> 1:32:55.340\n Is that, do you also see that kind of,\n\n1:32:55.340 --> 1:32:58.940\n because people now form groups on the internet\n\n1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:03.820\n that they stick together so they can sort of,\n\n1:33:03.820 --> 1:33:08.660\n these cognitive systems can collect themselves\n\n1:33:08.660 --> 1:33:13.660\n and breed together in different layers of spaces.\n\n1:33:14.420 --> 1:33:15.940\n It doesn't just have to be physical space.\n\n1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:17.180\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1:33:17.180 --> 1:33:19.740\n So basically there's the physical rearrangement,\n\n1:33:19.740 --> 1:33:21.860\n but there's also the conglomeration\n\n1:33:21.860 --> 1:33:24.340\n of the same cognitive system.\n\n1:33:24.340 --> 1:33:25.860\n Doesn't need to be, i.e. human.\n\n1:33:26.820 --> 1:33:29.140\n Doesn't need to belong to only one community.\n\n1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:30.340\n So yes, you might be a member\n\n1:33:30.340 --> 1:33:31.580\n of the computer science department,\n\n1:33:31.580 --> 1:33:33.820\n but you can also hang out in the biology department.\n\n1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:35.820\n But you might also go online into,\n\n1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:37.940\n I don't know, poetry department readings\n\n1:33:37.940 --> 1:33:38.780\n and so on and so forth.\n\n1:33:38.780 --> 1:33:40.620\n Or you might be part of a group\n\n1:33:40.620 --> 1:33:42.820\n that only has 12 people in the world,\n\n1:33:42.820 --> 1:33:45.300\n but that are connected through their ideas\n\n1:33:45.300 --> 1:33:49.340\n and are now interbreeding these ideas in a whole other way.\n\n1:33:49.340 --> 1:33:53.140\n So this coevolution of genes and memes\n\n1:33:53.140 --> 1:33:55.220\n is not just physically instantiated.\n\n1:33:55.220 --> 1:34:00.220\n It's also sort of rearranged in this cognitive space as well.\n\n1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:05.100\n And sometimes these cognitive systems hold conferences\n\n1:34:05.100 --> 1:34:06.820\n and they all gather around\n\n1:34:06.820 --> 1:34:09.060\n and there's like one of them is like talking\n\n1:34:09.060 --> 1:34:10.100\n and they're all like listening\n\n1:34:10.100 --> 1:34:12.540\n and then they discuss and then they have free lunch\n\n1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:13.380\n and so on.\n\n1:34:13.380 --> 1:34:15.980\n No, but then that's where you find students\n\n1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:18.260\n where when I go to a conference,\n\n1:34:18.260 --> 1:34:20.940\n I go through the posters where I'm on a mission.\n\n1:34:20.940 --> 1:34:23.580\n Basically my mission is to read and understand\n\n1:34:23.580 --> 1:34:25.060\n what every poster is about.\n\n1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:25.900\n And for a few of them,\n\n1:34:25.900 --> 1:34:27.660\n I'll dive deeply and understand everything,\n\n1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.940\n but I make it a point to just go poster after poster\n\n1:34:29.940 --> 1:34:31.820\n in order to read all of them.\n\n1:34:31.820 --> 1:34:35.460\n And I find some gems and students that I speak to\n\n1:34:35.460 --> 1:34:37.780\n that sometimes eventually join my lab.\n\n1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:41.820\n And then sort of you're sort of creating this permeation\n\n1:34:41.820 --> 1:34:46.820\n of the transfer of ideas, of ways of thinking\n\n1:34:48.260 --> 1:34:52.940\n and very often of moral values, of social structures,\n\n1:34:52.940 --> 1:34:57.940\n of just more imperceptible properties\n\n1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:00.860\n of these cognitive systems\n\n1:35:00.860 --> 1:35:02.660\n that simply just cling together.\n\n1:35:02.660 --> 1:35:07.140\n Basically, I have the luxury at MIT\n\n1:35:07.140 --> 1:35:09.140\n of not just choosing smart people,\n\n1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:12.660\n but choosing smart people who I get along with,\n\n1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:17.660\n who are generous and friendly and creative and smart\n\n1:35:17.820 --> 1:35:22.820\n and excited and childish in their uninhibited behaviors\n\n1:35:25.220 --> 1:35:26.060\n and so on and so forth.\n\n1:35:26.060 --> 1:35:29.860\n So you basically can choose yourself to surround,\n\n1:35:29.860 --> 1:35:31.260\n you can choose to surround yourself\n\n1:35:31.260 --> 1:35:36.140\n with people who are not only cognitively compatible,\n\n1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:39.780\n but also imperceptibly\n\n1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:43.580\n through the meta cognitive systems compatible.\n\n1:35:43.580 --> 1:35:46.740\n And again, when I say compatible, not all the same.\n\n1:35:46.740 --> 1:35:50.580\n Sometimes, not sometimes, all the time.\n\n1:35:50.580 --> 1:35:53.540\n The teams are made out of complimentary components,\n\n1:35:53.540 --> 1:35:56.220\n not just compatible, but very often complimentary.\n\n1:35:56.220 --> 1:35:59.580\n So in my own team, I have a diversity of students\n\n1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:01.900\n who come from very different backgrounds.\n\n1:36:01.900 --> 1:36:04.180\n There's a whole spectrum of biology to computation,\n\n1:36:04.180 --> 1:36:06.660\n of course, but within biology, there's a lot of realms.\n\n1:36:06.660 --> 1:36:08.820\n Within computation, there's a lot of realms.\n\n1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:13.340\n And what makes us click so well together\n\n1:36:13.340 --> 1:36:16.620\n is the fact that not only do we have a common mission,\n\n1:36:16.620 --> 1:36:21.620\n a common passion and a common view of the world,\n\n1:36:22.500 --> 1:36:25.540\n but that we're complimentary in our skills,\n\n1:36:25.540 --> 1:36:28.060\n in our angles with which we come at it and so on and so forth.\n\n1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:29.700\n And that's sort of what makes it click.\n\n1:36:29.700 --> 1:36:32.860\n Yeah, it's fascinating that the stickiness\n\n1:36:32.860 --> 1:36:35.980\n of multiple cognitive systems together\n\n1:36:35.980 --> 1:36:37.980\n includes both the commonality,\n\n1:36:37.980 --> 1:36:40.740\n so you meet because there's some common thing,\n\n1:36:40.740 --> 1:36:45.180\n but you stick together because you're different\n\n1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:46.740\n in all the useful ways.\n\n1:36:46.740 --> 1:36:47.580\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:51.780\n And my wife and I, I mean, we adore each other to pieces,\n\n1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:54.300\n but we're also extremely different in many ways.\n\n1:36:54.300 --> 1:36:55.900\n And that's beautiful. Careful.\n\n1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:57.100\n She's gonna be listening to this.\n\n1:36:57.100 --> 1:36:59.020\n But I love that about us.\n\n1:36:59.020 --> 1:37:01.900\n I love the fact that I'm living out there\n\n1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:05.580\n in the world of ideas and I forget what day it is.\n\n1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.060\n And she's like, well, at 8 a.m.,\n\n1:37:07.060 --> 1:37:08.260\n the kids better be to school.\n\n1:37:08.260 --> 1:37:09.260\n Right.\n\n1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:14.260\n And I do get yelled at, but I need it.\n\n1:37:15.460 --> 1:37:18.100\n Basically, I need her as much as she needs me.\n\n1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.180\n And she loves interacting with me and talking.\n\n1:37:20.180 --> 1:37:23.540\n I mean, last night, we were talking about this\n\n1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:24.580\n and I showed her the questions\n\n1:37:24.580 --> 1:37:26.540\n and we were bouncing ideas off each other.\n\n1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:28.140\n And it was just beautiful.\n\n1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:32.180\n We basically have these, basically,\n\n1:37:32.180 --> 1:37:36.060\n cognitive, let it all loose kind of dates\n\n1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:38.260\n where we just bring papers\n\n1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:41.020\n and we're bouncing ideas, et cetera.\n\n1:37:41.020 --> 1:37:44.540\n So we have extremely different perspectives,\n\n1:37:44.540 --> 1:37:49.540\n but very common goals and interests and anyway.\n\n1:37:49.900 --> 1:37:52.260\n What do you make of the communication mechanism\n\n1:37:52.260 --> 1:37:54.180\n that we humans use to share those ideas?\n\n1:37:54.180 --> 1:37:57.300\n Because one essential element of all of this\n\n1:37:57.300 --> 1:38:01.500\n is not just that we're able to have these ideas,\n\n1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:03.740\n but we're also able to share them.\n\n1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:06.060\n We tend to, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:38:06.060 --> 1:38:10.060\n but we seem to use language to share the ideas.\n\n1:38:10.060 --> 1:38:12.100\n Maybe we share them in some much deeper way\n\n1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:13.220\n than language, I don't know.\n\n1:38:13.220 --> 1:38:15.780\n But what do you make of this whole mechanism\n\n1:38:15.780 --> 1:38:18.740\n that ghaf on the matlid is to the human condition?\n\n1:38:18.740 --> 1:38:20.100\n So some people will tell you\n\n1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:23.140\n that your language dictates your thoughts\n\n1:38:23.140 --> 1:38:26.260\n and your thoughts cannot form outside language.\n\n1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:27.860\n I tend to disagree.\n\n1:38:27.860 --> 1:38:32.860\n I see thoughts as much more abstract\n\n1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:36.460\n as basically when I dream, I don't dream in words.\n\n1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:40.500\n I dream in shapes and forms and three dimensional space\n\n1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:42.380\n with extreme detail.\n\n1:38:42.380 --> 1:38:44.300\n I was describing, so when I wake up\n\n1:38:44.300 --> 1:38:47.140\n in the middle of the night, I actually record my dreams.\n\n1:38:47.140 --> 1:38:50.380\n Sometimes I write them down in a Dropbox file.\n\n1:38:50.380 --> 1:38:53.940\n Other times I'll just dictate them in audio.\n\n1:38:53.940 --> 1:38:57.420\n And my wife was giving me a massage the other day\n\n1:38:57.420 --> 1:39:00.020\n cause like my left side was frozen\n\n1:39:00.020 --> 1:39:02.780\n and I started playing the recording.\n\n1:39:02.780 --> 1:39:05.460\n And as I was listening to it, I was like,\n\n1:39:05.460 --> 1:39:06.300\n I don't remember any of that.\n\n1:39:06.300 --> 1:39:08.020\n And it was like, of course.\n\n1:39:08.020 --> 1:39:10.220\n And then the entire thing came back.\n\n1:39:10.220 --> 1:39:12.420\n But then there's no way any other person\n\n1:39:12.420 --> 1:39:15.780\n could have recreated that entire sort of\n\n1:39:15.780 --> 1:39:20.180\n three dimensional shape and dream and concept.\n\n1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:22.500\n And in the same way, when I'm thinking of ideas,\n\n1:39:22.500 --> 1:39:25.300\n there's so many ideas I can't put to words.\n\n1:39:25.300 --> 1:39:27.060\n I mean, I will describe them with a thousand words,\n\n1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:29.860\n but the idea itself is much more precise\n\n1:39:29.860 --> 1:39:31.500\n or much more sort of abstract\n\n1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:34.100\n or much more something difference,\n\n1:39:34.100 --> 1:39:36.380\n either less abstract or more abstract.\n\n1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:41.380\n And it's either, basically there's just the projection\n\n1:39:42.060 --> 1:39:44.620\n that happens from the three dimensional ideas\n\n1:39:44.620 --> 1:39:46.860\n into let's say a one dimensional language.\n\n1:39:46.860 --> 1:39:49.860\n And the language certainly gives you the apparatus\n\n1:39:49.860 --> 1:39:51.180\n to think about concepts\n\n1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:53.620\n that you didn't realize existed before.\n\n1:39:53.620 --> 1:39:56.380\n And with my team, we often create new words.\n\n1:39:56.380 --> 1:39:58.100\n I'm like, well, now we're gonna call these\n\n1:39:58.100 --> 1:39:59.980\n the regulatory plexus of a gene.\n\n1:39:59.980 --> 1:40:01.660\n And that gives us now the language\n\n1:40:01.660 --> 1:40:04.540\n to sort of build on that as one concept\n\n1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:07.820\n that you then build upon with all kinds of other things.\n\n1:40:07.820 --> 1:40:11.860\n So there's this coevolution again of ideas and language,\n\n1:40:11.860 --> 1:40:15.300\n but they're not one to one with each other.\n\n1:40:15.300 --> 1:40:20.300\n Now let's talk about language itself, words, sentences.\n\n1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:24.100\n This is a very distant construct\n\n1:40:24.100 --> 1:40:26.420\n from where language actually begun.\n\n1:40:26.420 --> 1:40:28.460\n So if you look at how we communicate,\n\n1:40:29.780 --> 1:40:32.980\n as I'm speaking, my eyes are shining\n\n1:40:32.980 --> 1:40:36.060\n and my face is changing through all kinds of emotions.\n\n1:40:36.060 --> 1:40:41.060\n And my entire body composition posture is reshaped.\n\n1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:44.300\n And my intonation, the pauses that I make,\n\n1:40:44.300 --> 1:40:47.220\n the softer and the louder and the this and that\n\n1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:50.700\n are conveying so much more information.\n\n1:40:50.700 --> 1:40:54.140\n And if you look at early human language,\n\n1:40:54.140 --> 1:40:57.100\n and if you look at how the great apes\n\n1:40:57.100 --> 1:40:59.180\n communicate with each other, there's a lot of grunting,\n\n1:40:59.180 --> 1:41:01.260\n there's a lot of posturing, there's a lot of emotions,\n\n1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:03.620\n there's a lot of sort of shrieking, et cetera.\n\n1:41:03.620 --> 1:41:08.620\n They have a lot of components of our human language,\n\n1:41:09.180 --> 1:41:10.420\n just not the words.\n\n1:41:10.420 --> 1:41:13.500\n So I think of human communication\n\n1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:19.020\n as combining the ape component,\n\n1:41:19.020 --> 1:41:22.940\n but also of course the GPT3 component.\n\n1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:24.940\n So basically there's the cognitive layer\n\n1:41:24.940 --> 1:41:27.820\n and the reasoning layer that we share\n\n1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:30.380\n with different parts of our relatives.\n\n1:41:30.380 --> 1:41:31.980\n There's the AI relatives,\n\n1:41:31.980 --> 1:41:34.500\n but there's also the grunting relatives.\n\n1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:37.660\n And what I love about humanity is that we have both.\n\n1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.340\n We're not just a conversational system.\n\n1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:44.060\n We're a grunting, emotionally charged,\n\n1:41:44.060 --> 1:41:49.060\n weirdly interconnected system\n\n1:41:49.060 --> 1:41:51.500\n that also has the ability to reason.\n\n1:41:51.500 --> 1:41:54.620\n And when we communicate with each other,\n\n1:41:54.620 --> 1:41:56.900\n there's so much more than just language.\n\n1:41:56.900 --> 1:41:59.060\n There's so much more than just words.\n\n1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:01.660\n It does seem like we're able to somehow transfer\n\n1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:04.620\n even more than the body language.\n\n1:42:04.620 --> 1:42:07.900\n It seems that in the room with us\n\n1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:12.900\n is always a giant knowledge base of shared experiences,\n\n1:42:13.380 --> 1:42:15.420\n different perspectives on those experiences,\n\n1:42:15.420 --> 1:42:19.100\n but I don't know, the knowledge of who the last three,\n\n1:42:19.100 --> 1:42:21.140\n four presidents in the United States was,\n\n1:42:21.140 --> 1:42:24.700\n and just all the 9 11, the tragedies in 9 11,\n\n1:42:24.700 --> 1:42:28.020\n all the beautiful and terrible things\n\n1:42:28.020 --> 1:42:28.860\n that happen in the world.\n\n1:42:28.860 --> 1:42:31.420\n They're somehow both in our minds\n\n1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:36.420\n and somehow enrich the ability to transfer information.\n\n1:42:37.060 --> 1:42:39.100\n What I love about it is I can talk to you\n\n1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:40.420\n about 2001 Odyssey of Space\n\n1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:41.940\n and mention a very specific scene\n\n1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:44.540\n and that evokes all these feelings that you had\n\n1:42:44.540 --> 1:42:45.540\n when you first watched it.\n\n1:42:45.540 --> 1:42:48.140\n We're both visualizing that and maybe in different ways.\n\n1:42:48.140 --> 1:42:48.980\n Exactly.\n\n1:42:48.980 --> 1:42:52.140\n But in that, yeah, and not only that,\n\n1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:56.100\n but the feeling is brought back up,\n\n1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.140\n just like you said, with the dreams.\n\n1:42:58.140 --> 1:43:01.140\n We both have that feeling arise in some form\n\n1:43:01.140 --> 1:43:06.140\n as you bring up the child facing his own mortality.\n\n1:43:07.180 --> 1:43:09.260\n It's fascinating that we're able to do that,\n\n1:43:09.260 --> 1:43:10.580\n but I don't know.\n\n1:43:10.580 --> 1:43:12.540\n Now let's talk about Neuralink for a second.\n\n1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:14.580\n So what's the concept of Neuralink?\n\n1:43:14.580 --> 1:43:17.060\n The concept of Neuralink is that I'm gonna take\n\n1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:19.700\n whatever knowledge is encoded in my brain\n\n1:43:19.700 --> 1:43:22.140\n directly transfer it into your brain.\n\n1:43:22.140 --> 1:43:25.260\n So this is a beautiful, fascinating,\n\n1:43:25.260 --> 1:43:29.180\n and extremely sort of appealing concept,\n\n1:43:29.180 --> 1:43:32.140\n but I see a lot of challenges surrounding that.\n\n1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:34.860\n The first one is we have no idea\n\n1:43:34.860 --> 1:43:36.740\n how to even begin to understand\n\n1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:40.100\n how knowledge is encoded in a person's brain.\n\n1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:41.860\n I mean, I told you about this paper that we had recently\n\n1:43:41.860 --> 1:43:45.380\n with Li Hui Cai and Asaf Marko\n\n1:43:45.380 --> 1:43:47.940\n that basically was looking at these engrams\n\n1:43:47.940 --> 1:43:50.580\n that are formed with combinations of neurons\n\n1:43:50.580 --> 1:43:53.140\n that cofire when a stimulus happens,\n\n1:43:53.140 --> 1:43:54.260\n where we can go into a mouse\n\n1:43:54.260 --> 1:43:56.780\n and select those neurons that fire by marking them\n\n1:43:56.780 --> 1:43:58.540\n and then see what happens when they first fire.\n\n1:43:58.540 --> 1:44:00.740\n And then select the neurons that fire again\n\n1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:02.700\n when the experience is repeated.\n\n1:44:02.700 --> 1:44:04.820\n These are the recall neurons,\n\n1:44:04.820 --> 1:44:07.580\n and then there's the memory consolidation neurons.\n\n1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.820\n So we're starting to understand a little bit\n\n1:44:09.820 --> 1:44:14.060\n of sort of the distributed nature of knowledge encoding\n\n1:44:14.060 --> 1:44:16.500\n and experience encoding in the human brain\n\n1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:17.900\n and in the mouse brain.\n\n1:44:17.900 --> 1:44:21.420\n And the concept that we'll understand\n\n1:44:21.420 --> 1:44:23.700\n that sufficiently one day\n\n1:44:23.700 --> 1:44:26.580\n to be able to take a snapshot\n\n1:44:26.580 --> 1:44:31.580\n of what does that scene from Dave losing his mind,\n\n1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:34.260\n of Khal losing his mind and talking to Dave,\n\n1:44:36.460 --> 1:44:39.340\n how is that seen and coded in your mind?\n\n1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:41.340\n Imagine the complexity of that.\n\n1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:44.780\n But now imagine, suppose that we solve this problem.\n\n1:44:45.740 --> 1:44:48.740\n And the next enormous challenge is how do I go\n\n1:44:48.740 --> 1:44:50.980\n and modify the next person's brain\n\n1:44:50.980 --> 1:44:54.260\n to now create the same exact neural connections?\n\n1:44:54.260 --> 1:44:56.260\n So that's an enormous challenge right there.\n\n1:44:56.260 --> 1:44:58.860\n So basically it's not just reading, it's now writing.\n\n1:45:00.140 --> 1:45:02.100\n And again, what if something goes wrong?\n\n1:45:02.100 --> 1:45:05.100\n I don't wanna even think about that, that's number two.\n\n1:45:05.100 --> 1:45:08.100\n And number three, who says that the way\n\n1:45:08.100 --> 1:45:11.460\n that you encode Dave, I'm losing my mind\n\n1:45:11.460 --> 1:45:14.660\n and I encode Dave, I'm losing my mind\n\n1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:17.220\n is anywhere near each other.\n\n1:45:17.220 --> 1:45:19.940\n Basically, maybe the way that I'm encoding it\n\n1:45:19.940 --> 1:45:24.780\n is twisted with my childhood memories of running through\n\n1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:28.020\n the pebbles in Greece, and yours is twisted\n\n1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.100\n with your childhood memories growing up in Russia.\n\n1:45:31.100 --> 1:45:34.660\n And there's no way that I can take my encoding\n\n1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:35.780\n and put it into your brain,\n\n1:45:35.780 --> 1:45:38.060\n because it'll A, mess things up,\n\n1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:42.940\n and B, be incompatible with your own unique experiences.\n\n1:45:42.940 --> 1:45:45.340\n So that's telepathic communication from human to human.\n\n1:45:45.340 --> 1:45:48.500\n It's fascinating, you're reminding us\n\n1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:51.900\n that there's two biological systems\n\n1:45:51.900 --> 1:45:54.460\n on both ends of that communication.\n\n1:45:54.460 --> 1:45:59.460\n The easier, I guess, maybe half as difficult thing to do\n\n1:45:59.620 --> 1:46:03.020\n in the hope with Neuralink is that we can communicate\n\n1:46:03.020 --> 1:46:06.100\n with an AI system, so where one side of that\n\n1:46:06.100 --> 1:46:08.740\n is a little bit more controllable,\n\n1:46:08.740 --> 1:46:13.340\n but even just that is exceptionally difficult.\n\n1:46:13.340 --> 1:46:16.780\n Let's talk about two neuronal systems talking to each other.\n\n1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:19.500\n Suppose that GPT4 tells GPT3, hey,\n\n1:46:19.500 --> 1:46:21.820\n give me all your knowledge, right?\n\n1:46:21.820 --> 1:46:24.340\n It's ready, I have 10 times more hardware,\n\n1:46:24.340 --> 1:46:25.980\n I'm ready, just feed me.\n\n1:46:25.980 --> 1:46:27.260\n What's GPT3 gonna do?\n\n1:46:27.260 --> 1:46:30.900\n Is it gonna say, oh, here's my 10 billion parameters?\n\n1:46:30.900 --> 1:46:32.660\n No. No way.\n\n1:46:32.660 --> 1:46:35.020\n The simplest way, and perhaps the fastest way\n\n1:46:35.020 --> 1:46:36.500\n for GPT3 to transfer all its knowledge\n\n1:46:36.500 --> 1:46:39.820\n to its older body that has a lot more hardware\n\n1:46:39.820 --> 1:46:44.820\n is to regenerate every single possible human sentence\n\n1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:46.620\n that it can possibly create.\n\n1:46:46.620 --> 1:46:48.100\n Just keep talking.\n\n1:46:48.100 --> 1:46:50.780\n Keep talking and just reencode it all together.\n\n1:46:50.780 --> 1:46:53.380\n So maybe what language does is exactly that.\n\n1:46:53.380 --> 1:46:56.740\n It's taking one generative cognitive model,\n\n1:46:56.740 --> 1:46:59.620\n it's running it forward to emit utterances\n\n1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:01.780\n that kind of make sense in my cognitive frame,\n\n1:47:01.780 --> 1:47:04.060\n and it's reencoding them into yours\n\n1:47:04.060 --> 1:47:07.260\n through the parsing of that same language.\n\n1:47:07.260 --> 1:47:09.700\n And I think the conversation might actually be\n\n1:47:09.700 --> 1:47:11.140\n the most efficient way to do it,\n\n1:47:11.140 --> 1:47:14.540\n so not just talking, but interactive,\n\n1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:18.340\n so talking back and forth, asking questions, interrupting.\n\n1:47:18.340 --> 1:47:20.860\n So GPT4 will constantly be interrupting.\n\n1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:25.100\n Annoying. Annoying, yeah.\n\n1:47:25.100 --> 1:47:27.740\n But the beauty of that is also that\n\n1:47:27.740 --> 1:47:29.820\n as we're interrupting each other,\n\n1:47:29.820 --> 1:47:33.460\n there's all kinds of misinterpretations that happen,\n\n1:47:33.460 --> 1:47:36.620\n that basically when my students speak,\n\n1:47:36.620 --> 1:47:38.980\n I will often know that I'm misunderstanding\n\n1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:41.420\n what they're saying, and I'll be like,\n\n1:47:41.420 --> 1:47:43.100\n hold that thought for a second.\n\n1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:44.860\n Let me tell you what I think I understood,\n\n1:47:44.860 --> 1:47:46.780\n which I know is different from what you said.\n\n1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:49.020\n Then I'll say that, and then someone else\n\n1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:50.540\n in the same Zoom meeting\n\n1:47:50.540 --> 1:47:53.780\n will basically say, well, here's another way\n\n1:47:53.780 --> 1:47:55.420\n to think about what you just said.\n\n1:47:55.420 --> 1:47:57.300\n And then by the third iteration,\n\n1:47:57.300 --> 1:47:59.260\n we're somewhere completely different,\n\n1:47:59.260 --> 1:48:01.980\n that if we could actually communicate\n\n1:48:01.980 --> 1:48:06.100\n with full neural network parameters back and forth\n\n1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:09.100\n of that knowledge and idea and coding,\n\n1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:11.860\n would be far inferior,\n\n1:48:11.860 --> 1:48:15.380\n because the reencoding with our own,\n\n1:48:15.380 --> 1:48:17.540\n as we said last time, emotional baggage\n\n1:48:17.540 --> 1:48:21.780\n and cognitive baggage from our unique experiences\n\n1:48:21.780 --> 1:48:26.780\n through our shared experiences, distinct encodings,\n\n1:48:27.260 --> 1:48:29.660\n in the context of all our unique experiences,\n\n1:48:29.660 --> 1:48:34.660\n is leading to so much more diversity of perspectives.\n\n1:48:37.140 --> 1:48:40.460\n And again, going back to this whole concept of these,\n\n1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:43.940\n entire network of all of human cognitive systems\n\n1:48:43.940 --> 1:48:45.820\n connected to each other,\n\n1:48:45.820 --> 1:48:48.980\n and sort of how ideas and memes permeate through that,\n\n1:48:48.980 --> 1:48:52.140\n that's sort of what really creates a whole new level\n\n1:48:52.140 --> 1:48:57.140\n of human experience through this reasoning layer\n\n1:48:59.140 --> 1:49:00.620\n and this computational layer\n\n1:49:00.620 --> 1:49:03.980\n that obviously lives on top of our cognitive layer.\n\n1:49:04.820 --> 1:49:09.820\n So you're one of these aforementioned cognitive systems,\n\n1:49:09.820 --> 1:49:14.820\n mortal, but thoughtful, and you're connected to a bunch,\n\n1:49:15.620 --> 1:49:19.500\n like you said, students, your wife, your kids.\n\n1:49:19.500 --> 1:49:23.500\n What do you, in your brief time here on Earth,\n\n1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:25.740\n this is a Meaning of Life episode,\n\n1:49:25.740 --> 1:49:30.740\n so what do you hope this world will remember you as?\n\n1:49:31.300 --> 1:49:33.140\n What do you hope your legacy will be?\n\n1:49:33.140 --> 1:49:38.140\n I don't think of legacy as much as maybe most people.\n\n1:49:40.620 --> 1:49:41.460\n Oh, it's kind of funny.\n\n1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:44.340\n I'm consciously living the present.\n\n1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:47.460\n Many students tell me, oh, give us some career advice.\n\n1:49:47.460 --> 1:49:48.940\n I'm like, I'm the wrong person.\n\n1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:50.700\n I've never made a career plan.\n\n1:49:50.700 --> 1:49:51.900\n I still have to make one.\n\n1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:56.900\n I, it's funny to be both experiencing the past,\n\n1:49:56.900 --> 1:50:01.900\n and the present, and the future,\n\n1:50:01.900 --> 1:50:04.580\n but also consciously living in the present,\n\n1:50:04.580 --> 1:50:08.460\n and just, there's a conscious decision we can make\n\n1:50:08.460 --> 1:50:10.260\n to not worry about all that,\n\n1:50:10.260 --> 1:50:13.740\n which again, goes back to the I'm the lucky one kind of thing\n\n1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:18.740\n of living in the present and being happy winning,\n\n1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:20.300\n and being happy losing,\n\n1:50:20.300 --> 1:50:23.580\n and there's a sort of,\n\n1:50:23.580 --> 1:50:27.740\n I'm happy losing, and there's a certain freedom\n\n1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:29.420\n that comes with that, but again,\n\n1:50:29.420 --> 1:50:32.700\n a certain sort of, I don't know,\n\n1:50:32.700 --> 1:50:36.060\n ephemerity of living for the present,\n\n1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:39.940\n but if you, if you stay back from all of that,\n\n1:50:39.940 --> 1:50:44.860\n where basically my current modus operandi\n\n1:50:44.860 --> 1:50:49.100\n is live for the present, make every day\n\n1:50:49.100 --> 1:50:50.700\n the best you can make,\n\n1:50:50.700 --> 1:50:55.300\n and just make the local blip of local maxima\n\n1:50:55.300 --> 1:50:58.740\n of the universe, of the awesomeness of the planet,\n\n1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:02.060\n and the town, and the family that we live in,\n\n1:51:02.060 --> 1:51:05.860\n both academic family and biological family,\n\n1:51:07.620 --> 1:51:08.700\n make it a little more awesome\n\n1:51:08.700 --> 1:51:09.900\n by being generous to your friends,\n\n1:51:09.900 --> 1:51:11.300\n being generous to the people around you,\n\n1:51:11.300 --> 1:51:13.620\n being kind to your enemies,\n\n1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:17.740\n and just showing love all around.\n\n1:51:17.740 --> 1:51:21.540\n You can't be upset at people if you truly love them.\n\n1:51:21.540 --> 1:51:23.380\n If somebody yells at you and insults you\n\n1:51:23.380 --> 1:51:25.780\n every time you say the slightest thing,\n\n1:51:25.780 --> 1:51:28.940\n and yet when you see them, you just see them with love,\n\n1:51:30.220 --> 1:51:31.660\n it's a beautiful feeling.\n\n1:51:31.660 --> 1:51:34.660\n It's like, you know, I'm feeling exactly like\n\n1:51:34.660 --> 1:51:37.620\n when I look at my three year old who's like screaming,\n\n1:51:37.620 --> 1:51:39.740\n even though I love her and I want her good,\n\n1:51:39.740 --> 1:51:42.780\n she's still screaming and saying, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n1:51:42.780 --> 1:51:47.100\n And I'm like, I love you, genuinely love you,\n\n1:51:47.100 --> 1:51:49.580\n but I can sort of kind of see that your brain\n\n1:51:49.580 --> 1:51:53.860\n is kind of stuck in that little mode of anger.\n\n1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:58.260\n And there's plenty of people out there who don't like me,\n\n1:51:58.260 --> 1:52:01.460\n and I see them with love as a child\n\n1:52:01.460 --> 1:52:04.540\n that is stuck in a cognitive state\n\n1:52:04.540 --> 1:52:06.980\n that they're eventually gonna snap out of,\n\n1:52:06.980 --> 1:52:08.980\n or maybe not, and that's okay.\n\n1:52:08.980 --> 1:52:12.980\n So there's that aspect of sort of experiencing life\n\n1:52:12.980 --> 1:52:16.980\n with the best intentions.\n\n1:52:16.980 --> 1:52:20.380\n And I love when I'm wrong.\n\n1:52:20.380 --> 1:52:22.700\n I had a friend who was like one of the smartest people\n\n1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:24.700\n I've ever met who would basically say,\n\n1:52:24.700 --> 1:52:26.300\n oh, I love it when I'm wrong\n\n1:52:26.300 --> 1:52:27.860\n because it makes me feel human.\n\n1:52:27.860 --> 1:52:31.100\n And it's so beautiful.\n\n1:52:31.100 --> 1:52:32.660\n I mean, she's really one of the smartest people\n\n1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:33.500\n I've ever met.\n\n1:52:33.500 --> 1:52:36.100\n And she was like, oh, it's such a good feeling.\n\n1:52:36.100 --> 1:52:41.100\n And I love being wrong, but there's something\n\n1:52:41.500 --> 1:52:42.540\n about self improvement.\n\n1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:45.260\n There's something about sort of how do I\n\n1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:49.100\n not make the most mistakes, but attempt the most rights\n\n1:52:49.100 --> 1:52:50.820\n and do the fewest wrongs,\n\n1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:53.100\n but with the full knowledge that this will happen.\n\n1:52:53.100 --> 1:52:54.400\n That's one aspect.\n\n1:52:55.340 --> 1:53:00.260\n So through this life in the present,\n\n1:53:00.260 --> 1:53:02.140\n what's really funny is,\n\n1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:04.540\n and that's something that I've experienced more and more\n\n1:53:04.540 --> 1:53:07.820\n really thanks to you and through this podcast,\n\n1:53:07.820 --> 1:53:11.100\n is this enormous number of people who will basically comment,\n\n1:53:11.100 --> 1:53:14.820\n wow, I've been following this guy for so many years now,\n\n1:53:14.820 --> 1:53:17.380\n or wow, this guy has inspired so many of us\n\n1:53:17.380 --> 1:53:19.540\n in computation biology and so on and so forth.\n\n1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:22.040\n I'm like, I don't know any of that,\n\n1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:23.580\n but I'm only discovering this now\n\n1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:27.940\n through these sort of sharing our emotional states\n\n1:53:27.940 --> 1:53:31.580\n and our cognitive states with a wider audience,\n\n1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:33.980\n where suddenly I'm sort of realizing that,\n\n1:53:33.980 --> 1:53:35.540\n wow, maybe I've had a legacy.\n\n1:53:36.820 --> 1:53:39.900\n Like basically I've trained generations of students\n\n1:53:39.900 --> 1:53:44.900\n from MIT and I've put all of my courses freely online\n\n1:53:45.220 --> 1:53:47.760\n since 2001.\n\n1:53:47.760 --> 1:53:50.140\n So basically all of my video recordings of my lectures\n\n1:53:50.140 --> 1:53:52.240\n have been online since 2001.\n\n1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.100\n So countless generations of people from across the world\n\n1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:58.540\n will meet me at a conference and say,\n\n1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:01.060\n like I was at this conference where somebody heard my voice\n\n1:54:01.060 --> 1:54:02.620\n and it's like, I know this voice,\n\n1:54:02.620 --> 1:54:04.540\n I've been listening to your lectures.\n\n1:54:04.540 --> 1:54:07.180\n And it's just such a beautiful thing where\n\n1:54:07.180 --> 1:54:11.400\n like we're sharing widely and who knows\n\n1:54:11.400 --> 1:54:13.900\n which students will get where\n\n1:54:13.900 --> 1:54:16.300\n from whatever they catch out of these lectures,\n\n1:54:16.300 --> 1:54:18.500\n even if what they catch is just inspiration\n\n1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:20.700\n and passion and drive.\n\n1:54:20.700 --> 1:54:25.700\n So there's this intangible legacy quote unquote\n\n1:54:26.260 --> 1:54:29.720\n that every one of us has through the people we touch.\n\n1:54:29.720 --> 1:54:31.940\n One of my friends from undergrad basically told me,\n\n1:54:31.940 --> 1:54:33.640\n oh, my mom remembers you vividly\n\n1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:34.480\n from when she came to campus.\n\n1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:36.080\n I'm like, I didn't even meet her.\n\n1:54:36.080 --> 1:54:39.380\n She's like, no, but she sort of saw you interacting\n\n1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:40.860\n with people and said, wow,\n\n1:54:40.860 --> 1:54:43.420\n he's exuding this positive energy.\n\n1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:47.020\n And there's that aspect of sort of just motivating people\n\n1:54:47.020 --> 1:54:50.620\n with your kindness, with your passion, with your generosity\n\n1:54:50.620 --> 1:54:55.620\n and with your just selflessness of just give,\n\n1:54:56.860 --> 1:54:58.980\n it doesn't matter where it goes.\n\n1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:01.820\n I've been to conferences where basically people will,\n\n1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:04.100\n I'll ask them a question and then they'll come back to,\n\n1:55:04.100 --> 1:55:06.380\n or there was a conference where I asked somebody a question\n\n1:55:06.380 --> 1:55:08.620\n and they said, oh, in fact, this entire project\n\n1:55:08.620 --> 1:55:10.500\n was inspired by your question three years ago\n\n1:55:10.500 --> 1:55:11.860\n at the same conference.\n\n1:55:11.860 --> 1:55:13.460\n I'm like, wow.\n\n1:55:13.460 --> 1:55:15.560\n And then on top of that, there's also the ripple effect.\n\n1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:18.500\n So you're speaking to the direct influence of inspiration\n\n1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:22.100\n or education, but there's also the follow on things\n\n1:55:22.100 --> 1:55:23.980\n that happen to that and there's this ripple\n\n1:55:23.980 --> 1:55:27.140\n that from you just this one individual first drop.\n\n1:55:27.140 --> 1:55:29.260\n And from every one of us, from everyone,\n\n1:55:29.260 --> 1:55:30.920\n that's what I love about humanity.\n\n1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:35.740\n The fact that every one of us shares genes\n\n1:55:36.660 --> 1:55:39.780\n and genetic variants with very recent ancestors\n\n1:55:39.780 --> 1:55:41.060\n with everyone else.\n\n1:55:41.060 --> 1:55:45.640\n So even if I die tomorrow, my genes are still shared\n\n1:55:45.640 --> 1:55:47.460\n through my cousins and through my uncles\n\n1:55:47.460 --> 1:55:49.980\n and through my immediate family.\n\n1:55:49.980 --> 1:55:52.740\n And of course I'm lucky enough to have my own children,\n\n1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:55.700\n but even if you don't, your genes are still permeating\n\n1:55:55.700 --> 1:55:57.540\n through all of the layers of your family.\n\n1:55:57.540 --> 1:56:00.220\n So your genes will have the legacy there, yeah.\n\n1:56:00.220 --> 1:56:01.360\n Every one of us.\n\n1:56:02.460 --> 1:56:05.020\n Number two, our ideas are constantly intermingling\n\n1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:05.840\n with each other.\n\n1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:08.780\n So there's no person living in the planet\n\n1:56:08.780 --> 1:56:12.040\n a hundred years from now who will not be directly impacted\n\n1:56:12.040 --> 1:56:14.560\n by every one of the planet living here today\n\n1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:18.540\n through genetic inheritance and through meme inheritance.\n\n1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:22.060\n That's cool to think that your ideas, Manolis Callas,\n\n1:56:22.060 --> 1:56:27.060\n would touch every single person on this planet.\n\n1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:27.940\n It's interesting.\n\n1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:30.300\n It's not just mine, Joe Smith, who's looking at this\n\n1:56:30.300 --> 1:56:33.900\n right now, his ideas will also touch everybody.\n\n1:56:33.900 --> 1:56:37.100\n So there's this interconnectedness of humanity.\n\n1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:39.220\n And then I'm also a professor.\n\n1:56:39.220 --> 1:56:42.140\n So my day job is legacy.\n\n1:56:42.140 --> 1:56:46.180\n My day job is training, not just the thousands of people\n\n1:56:46.180 --> 1:56:47.900\n who watch my videos on the web,\n\n1:56:47.900 --> 1:56:50.300\n but the people who are actually in my class,\n\n1:56:50.300 --> 1:56:55.020\n who basically come to MIT to learn from a bunch of us.\n\n1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:58.420\n The cognitive systems that were shipped to this particular\n\n1:56:58.420 --> 1:56:59.260\n location in space.\n\n1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:00.540\n And who will then disperse back\n\n1:57:00.540 --> 1:57:02.660\n into all of their home countries.\n\n1:57:02.660 --> 1:57:05.200\n That's what makes America the beacon of the world.\n\n1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:09.100\n We don't just export goods.\n\n1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:10.900\n We export people.\n\n1:57:10.900 --> 1:57:12.140\n Cognitive systems.\n\n1:57:12.140 --> 1:57:15.300\n We export people who are born here.\n\n1:57:15.300 --> 1:57:18.980\n And we also export training that people born elsewhere\n\n1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:21.940\n will come here to get and will then disseminate,\n\n1:57:21.940 --> 1:57:23.940\n not just whatever knowledge they got,\n\n1:57:23.940 --> 1:57:26.140\n but whatever ideals they learned.\n\n1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:28.700\n And I think that's something that's a legacy of the US\n\n1:57:28.700 --> 1:57:31.260\n that you cannot stop with political isolation.\n\n1:57:31.260 --> 1:57:33.460\n You cannot stop with economic isolation.\n\n1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:35.700\n That's something that will continue to happen\n\n1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:38.260\n through all the people we've touched through our universities.\n\n1:57:38.260 --> 1:57:40.940\n So there's the students who took my classes,\n\n1:57:40.940 --> 1:57:44.220\n who are basically now going off and teaching their classes.\n\n1:57:44.220 --> 1:57:46.460\n And I've trained generations of computational biologists.\n\n1:57:46.460 --> 1:57:48.620\n No one in genomics who's gone through MIT\n\n1:57:48.620 --> 1:57:50.060\n hasn't taken my class.\n\n1:57:50.060 --> 1:57:53.020\n So basically there's this impact through,\n\n1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:55.220\n I mean, there's so many people in biotechs who are like,\n\n1:57:55.220 --> 1:57:56.260\n hey, I took your class.\n\n1:57:56.260 --> 1:57:58.380\n That's what got me into the field like 15 years ago.\n\n1:57:58.380 --> 1:58:00.140\n And it's just so beautiful.\n\n1:58:00.140 --> 1:58:04.760\n And then there's the academic family that I have.\n\n1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:07.740\n So the students who are actually studying with me,\n\n1:58:07.740 --> 1:58:09.280\n who are my trainees.\n\n1:58:09.280 --> 1:58:12.880\n So this sort of mentorship of ancient Greece.\n\n1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:20.020\n So I basically have an academic family and we are a family.\n\n1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:24.200\n There's this such strong connection,\n\n1:58:24.200 --> 1:58:27.640\n this bond of you're part of the Kelly's family.\n\n1:58:27.640 --> 1:58:29.840\n So I have a biological family at home\n\n1:58:29.840 --> 1:58:32.120\n and I have an academic family on campus.\n\n1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:33.720\n And that academic family\n\n1:58:33.720 --> 1:58:36.240\n has given me great grandchildren already.\n\n1:58:36.240 --> 1:58:37.120\n Yes.\n\n1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:40.720\n So I've trained people who are now professors at Stanford,\n\n1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:45.720\n CMU, Harvard, WashU, I mean, everywhere in the world.\n\n1:58:46.400 --> 1:58:49.240\n And these people have now trained people\n\n1:58:49.240 --> 1:58:53.060\n who are now having their own faculty jobs.\n\n1:58:53.060 --> 1:58:55.160\n So there's basically people who see me\n\n1:58:55.160 --> 1:58:57.360\n as their academic grandfather.\n\n1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:58.440\n And it's just so beautiful\n\n1:58:58.440 --> 1:59:00.460\n because you don't have to wait for the 18 years\n\n1:59:00.460 --> 1:59:03.920\n of cognitive hardware development\n\n1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:07.440\n to sort of have amazing conversation with people.\n\n1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:09.640\n These are fully grown humans, fully grown adult\n\n1:59:09.640 --> 1:59:14.640\n who are cognitively super ready and who are shaped by,\n\n1:59:15.680 --> 1:59:18.720\n and I see some of these beautiful papers and I'm like,\n\n1:59:18.720 --> 1:59:21.880\n I can see the touch of our lab in those papers.\n\n1:59:21.880 --> 1:59:22.720\n It's just so beautiful.\n\n1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:25.560\n Cause you're like, I spent hours with these people\n\n1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:28.760\n teaching them not just how to do a paper, but how to think.\n\n1:59:29.740 --> 1:59:31.960\n And this whole concept of, you know,\n\n1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:34.200\n the first paper that we write together\n\n1:59:34.200 --> 1:59:37.480\n is an experience with every one of these students.\n\n1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:38.760\n So, you know, I always tell them\n\n1:59:38.760 --> 1:59:40.560\n to write the whole first draft\n\n1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:43.320\n and they know that I will rewrite every word.\n\n1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:45.840\n But the act of them writing it\n\n1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:48.320\n and what I do is these like joint editing sessions\n\n1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:50.080\n where I'm like, let's coedit.\n\n1:59:50.080 --> 1:59:53.040\n And with this coediting, we basically have...\n\n1:59:53.040 --> 1:59:55.080\n Creative destruction.\n\n1:59:55.080 --> 1:59:56.680\n So I share my Zoom screen\n\n1:59:56.680 --> 1:59:59.600\n and I'm just thinking out loud as I'm doing this.\n\n1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:01.200\n And they're learning from that process\n\n2:00:01.200 --> 2:00:03.180\n as opposed to like come back two days later\n\n2:00:03.180 --> 2:00:05.080\n and they see a bunch of red on a page.\n\n2:00:05.080 --> 2:00:08.120\n I'm sort of, well, that's not how you write this.\n\n2:00:08.120 --> 2:00:09.480\n That's not how you think about this.\n\n2:00:09.480 --> 2:00:10.840\n That's not, you know, what's the point?\n\n2:00:10.840 --> 2:00:12.600\n Like this morning was having,\n\n2:00:12.600 --> 2:00:14.600\n yes, this morning between six and 8 a.m.\n\n2:00:14.600 --> 2:00:15.800\n I had a two hour meeting\n\n2:00:15.800 --> 2:00:18.280\n going through one of these papers\n\n2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:20.800\n and then saying, what's the point here?\n\n2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:22.200\n Why do you even show that?\n\n2:00:22.200 --> 2:00:24.040\n It's just a bunch of points on a graph.\n\n2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:26.640\n No, what you have to do is extract the meaning,\n\n2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:28.240\n do the homework for them.\n\n2:00:28.240 --> 2:00:32.440\n And there's this nurturing, this mentorship\n\n2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.640\n that sort of creates now a legacy,\n\n2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:39.400\n which is infinite because they've now gone off on the,\n\n2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:42.120\n you know, and all of that is just humanity.\n\n2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.200\n Then of course there's the papers I write\n\n2:00:44.200 --> 2:00:48.240\n because yes, my day job is training students,\n\n2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:50.280\n but it's a research university.\n\n2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:54.400\n The way that they learn is through the mens and manus,\n\n2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:56.000\n mind and hand.\n\n2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:59.360\n It's the practical training of actually doing research.\n\n2:00:59.360 --> 2:01:03.860\n And that research is a beneficial side effect\n\n2:01:03.860 --> 2:01:06.640\n of having these awesome papers\n\n2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:10.900\n that will now tell other people how to think.\n\n2:01:10.900 --> 2:01:13.240\n There's this paper we just posted recently on MedArchive\n\n2:01:13.240 --> 2:01:16.200\n and one of the most generous and eloquent comments about it\n\n2:01:16.200 --> 2:01:21.200\n was like, wow, this is a masterclass in scientific writing,\n\n2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:24.920\n in analysis, in biological interpretation, and so forth.\n\n2:01:24.920 --> 2:01:27.500\n It's just so fulfilling from a person I've never met\n\n2:01:27.500 --> 2:01:28.340\n or heard about.\n\n2:01:28.340 --> 2:01:30.720\n Can you say the title of the paper, Brian Chen?\n\n2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:31.860\n I don't remember the title,\n\n2:01:31.860 --> 2:01:36.700\n but it's single cell dissection of schizophrenia reveals.\n\n2:01:38.240 --> 2:01:39.920\n So the two points that we found\n\n2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:42.780\n was this whole transcriptional resilience.\n\n2:01:42.780 --> 2:01:46.600\n Like there's some individuals who are schizophrenic,\n\n2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:50.040\n but they have an additional cell type\n\n2:01:50.040 --> 2:01:53.560\n or an additional cell state, which we believe is protective.\n\n2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:55.680\n And that cell state when they have it\n\n2:01:55.680 --> 2:01:58.920\n will cause other cells to have normal gene expression patterns.\n\n2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:00.440\n It's beautiful.\n\n2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:03.980\n And then that cell is connected\n\n2:02:03.980 --> 2:02:06.120\n with some of the PV interneurons\n\n2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:09.520\n that are basically sending these inhibitory brainwaves\n\n2:02:09.520 --> 2:02:10.860\n through the brain.\n\n2:02:10.860 --> 2:02:14.940\n And basically there's another component of,\n\n2:02:14.940 --> 2:02:18.460\n there's a set of master regulators that we discovered\n\n2:02:18.460 --> 2:02:20.760\n who are controlling many of the genes\n\n2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:22.600\n that are differentially expressed.\n\n2:02:22.600 --> 2:02:24.500\n And these master regulators are themselves\n\n2:02:24.500 --> 2:02:27.120\n genetic targets of schizophrenia.\n\n2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:28.700\n And they are themselves involved\n\n2:02:28.700 --> 2:02:31.840\n in both synaptic connectivity\n\n2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.740\n and also in early brain development.\n\n2:02:34.740 --> 2:02:36.880\n So there's this sort of interconnectedness\n\n2:02:36.880 --> 2:02:40.160\n between synaptic development axis\n\n2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:41.640\n and also this transcriptional resilience.\n\n2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:43.120\n So, I mean, we basically made up a title\n\n2:02:43.120 --> 2:02:44.860\n that combines all these concepts.\n\n2:02:44.860 --> 2:02:45.760\n You have all these concepts,\n\n2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:46.920\n all these people working together,\n\n2:02:46.920 --> 2:02:49.640\n and ultimately these minds condense it down\n\n2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:51.800\n into a beautifully written little document\n\n2:02:51.800 --> 2:02:52.640\n that lives on forever. Exactly.\n\n2:02:52.640 --> 2:02:55.040\n And that document now has its own life.\n\n2:02:55.040 --> 2:02:59.940\n Our work has 120,000 citations.\n\n2:02:59.940 --> 2:03:02.100\n I mean, that's not just people who read it.\n\n2:03:02.100 --> 2:03:03.740\n These are people who used it\n\n2:03:03.740 --> 2:03:05.760\n to write something based on it.\n\n2:03:05.760 --> 2:03:10.640\n I mean, that to me is just so fulfilling\n\n2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:12.960\n to basically say, wow, I've touched people.\n\n2:03:12.960 --> 2:03:17.780\n So I don't think of my legacy as I live every day.\n\n2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:20.300\n I just think of the beauty of the present\n\n2:03:20.300 --> 2:03:22.440\n and the power of interconnectedness.\n\n2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:25.020\n And just, I feel like a kid in a candy shop\n\n2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:28.040\n where I'm just like constantly,\n\n2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:31.620\n where do I, what package do I open first?\n\n2:03:31.620 --> 2:03:33.980\n And, you know. You're the lucky one.\n\n2:03:33.980 --> 2:03:37.880\n A jack of all trades, a master of none.\n\n2:03:37.880 --> 2:03:41.320\n I think for a Meaning of Life episode,\n\n2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:45.400\n we would be amiss if we did not have at least a poem or two.\n\n2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:49.360\n Do you mind if we end in a couple of poems?\n\n2:03:49.360 --> 2:03:51.720\n Maybe a happy, maybe a sad one.\n\n2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:52.680\n I would love that.\n\n2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:54.160\n So thank you for the luxury.\n\n2:03:55.360 --> 2:03:57.080\n The first one is kind of,\n\n2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:03.720\n I remember when you were talking with Eric Weinstein\n\n2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:08.720\n about this comment of Leonard Cohen that says,\n\n2:04:09.460 --> 2:04:11.880\n but you don't really care for music, do you?\n\n2:04:11.880 --> 2:04:12.760\n In Hallelujah.\n\n2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:16.260\n That's basically kind of like mocking its reader.\n\n2:04:16.260 --> 2:04:18.520\n So one of my poems is a little like that.\n\n2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:23.520\n So I had just broken up with my girlfriend\n\n2:04:23.720 --> 2:04:26.920\n and there's this other friend who was coming to visit me.\n\n2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:30.420\n And she said, I will not come unless you write me a poem.\n\n2:04:30.420 --> 2:04:35.420\n And I was like, writing a poem on demand.\n\n2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:40.880\n So this poem is called Write Me a Poem.\n\n2:04:40.880 --> 2:04:44.280\n It goes, write me a poem, she said with a smile.\n\n2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:47.120\n Make sure it's pretty, romantic and rhymes.\n\n2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:49.480\n Make sure it's worthy of that bold flame,\n\n2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:52.560\n that love uniting us beyond a mere game.\n\n2:04:52.560 --> 2:04:54.840\n And she took off without more words,\n\n2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:57.840\n rushed for the bus and traveled the world.\n\n2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:00.640\n A poem, I thought, this is sublime.\n\n2:05:00.640 --> 2:05:03.120\n What better way for passing the time?\n\n2:05:03.120 --> 2:05:05.380\n What better way to count up the hours\n\n2:05:05.380 --> 2:05:08.440\n before she comes back to my lonely tower?\n\n2:05:08.440 --> 2:05:10.400\n Waiting for joy to fill up my heart,\n\n2:05:10.400 --> 2:05:13.280\n let's write a poem for when we're apart.\n\n2:05:13.280 --> 2:05:16.040\n How does a poem start, I inquired.\n\n2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:18.400\n Give me a topic, cook up a style.\n\n2:05:18.400 --> 2:05:20.840\n Throw in some cute words, oh, here and there.\n\n2:05:20.840 --> 2:05:22.840\n Throw in some passion, love and despair.\n\n2:05:23.760 --> 2:05:26.760\n Love, three eggs, one pound of flour,\n\n2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:28.860\n three cups of water and bake for an hour.\n\n2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:32.300\n Love is no recipe as I understand.\n\n2:05:32.300 --> 2:05:34.560\n You can't just cook up a poem on demand.\n\n2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:37.080\n And as I was twisting all this in my mind,\n\n2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:40.920\n I looked at the page, by golly, it rhymed.\n\n2:05:40.920 --> 2:05:43.960\n Three roses, white chocolate, vanilla powder,\n\n2:05:43.960 --> 2:05:46.640\n some beautiful rhymes and maybe a flower.\n\n2:05:46.640 --> 2:05:49.360\n No, be romantic, the young girl insisted.\n\n2:05:49.360 --> 2:05:51.600\n Do this, do that, don't be so silly.\n\n2:05:51.600 --> 2:05:53.400\n You must believe it straight from your heart.\n\n2:05:53.400 --> 2:05:56.800\n If you don't feel it, we're better apart.\n\n2:05:56.800 --> 2:05:59.520\n Oh, my sweet thing, what can I say?\n\n2:05:59.520 --> 2:06:02.960\n You bring me the sun all night and all day.\n\n2:06:02.960 --> 2:06:06.060\n You're the stars and the moon and the birds way up high.\n\n2:06:06.060 --> 2:06:09.440\n You're my evening sweet song, my morning blue sky.\n\n2:06:09.440 --> 2:06:12.480\n You are my muse, your spell has me caught.\n\n2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:15.640\n You bring me my voice and scatter my thoughts.\n\n2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:19.160\n To put that loving writing in vain, I can try.\n\n2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:22.400\n But when I'm with you, my wings want to fly.\n\n2:06:22.400 --> 2:06:25.640\n So I put down the pen and drop my defenses.\n\n2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:28.560\n Give myself to you and fill up my senses.\n\n2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:35.040\n The baffled king composing, that was beautiful.\n\n2:06:35.040 --> 2:06:38.160\n What I love about it is that I did not\n\n2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:39.760\n bring up a dictionary of rhymes.\n\n2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:42.200\n I did not sort of work hard.\n\n2:06:42.200 --> 2:06:45.560\n So basically when I write poems, I just type.\n\n2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:46.880\n I never go back, I just.\n\n2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:50.880\n So when my brain gets into that mode,\n\n2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:52.800\n it actually happens like I wrote it.\n\n2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:54.320\n Oh, wow, so the rhymes just kind of.\n\n2:06:54.320 --> 2:06:55.160\n The rhymes just kind of come.\n\n2:06:55.160 --> 2:06:56.000\n It's an emergent phenomenon.\n\n2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:57.080\n It's an emergent phenomenon.\n\n2:06:57.080 --> 2:07:00.960\n I just get into that mode and then it comes up.\n\n2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:02.040\n That's a beautiful one.\n\n2:07:02.040 --> 2:07:06.760\n And it's basically, you know, as you got it,\n\n2:07:06.760 --> 2:07:08.120\n it's basically saying it's no recipe\n\n2:07:08.120 --> 2:07:09.880\n and then I'm throwing in the recipes\n\n2:07:09.880 --> 2:07:11.600\n and as I'm writing it, I'm like, you know.\n\n2:07:11.600 --> 2:07:16.480\n So it's very introspective in this whole concept.\n\n2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:19.560\n So anyway, there's another one many years earlier\n\n2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:23.600\n that is, you know, darker.\n\n2:07:23.600 --> 2:07:26.760\n It's basically this whole concept of let's be friends.\n\n2:07:26.760 --> 2:07:29.760\n I was like, ugh, you know.\n\n2:07:29.760 --> 2:07:32.480\n No, let's be friends, just like, you know.\n\n2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:34.080\n So the last words are shout out,\n\n2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:36.240\n I love you or send me to hell.\n\n2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:40.000\n So the title is Burn Me Tonight.\n\n2:07:41.520 --> 2:07:43.200\n Lie to me, baby.\n\n2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:44.680\n Lie to me now.\n\n2:07:44.680 --> 2:07:45.920\n Tell me you love me.\n\n2:07:45.920 --> 2:07:47.080\n Break me a vow.\n\n2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:49.920\n Give me a sweet word, a promise, a kiss.\n\n2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:52.760\n Give me the world, a sweet taste to miss.\n\n2:07:52.760 --> 2:07:56.120\n Don't let me lay here, inert, ugly, cold,\n\n2:07:56.120 --> 2:07:59.120\n with nothing sweet felt and nothing harsh told.\n\n2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:02.360\n Give me some hope, false, foolish, yet kind.\n\n2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:05.120\n Make me regret, I'll leave you behind.\n\n2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:08.240\n Don't pity my soul or torture it right.\n\n2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:09.560\n Treat it with hatred.\n\n2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:11.040\n Start up a fight.\n\n2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:14.040\n For it's from mildness that my soul dies\n\n2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:18.600\n when you cover your passion in a bland friend's disguise.\n\n2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:19.560\n Kiss me now, baby.\n\n2:08:19.560 --> 2:08:21.080\n Show me your passion.\n\n2:08:21.080 --> 2:08:23.640\n Turn off the lights and rip off your fashion.\n\n2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:26.720\n Give me my life's joy this one night.\n\n2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:30.120\n Burn all my matches for one blazing light.\n\n2:08:30.120 --> 2:08:32.480\n Don't think of tomorrow and let today fade.\n\n2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:35.560\n Don't try and protect me from love's cutting blade.\n\n2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:38.480\n Your razor will always rip off my veins.\n\n2:08:38.480 --> 2:08:42.080\n Don't spare me the passion to spare me the pains.\n\n2:08:42.080 --> 2:08:44.600\n Kiss me now, honey, or spit in my face.\n\n2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:47.680\n Throw me an insult I'll gladly embrace.\n\n2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:49.960\n Tell me now clearly that you never cared.\n\n2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:52.800\n Say it now loudly like you never dared.\n\n2:08:52.800 --> 2:08:54.080\n I'm ready to hear it.\n\n2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:55.480\n I'm ready to die.\n\n2:08:55.480 --> 2:08:58.520\n I'm ready to burn and start a new life.\n\n2:08:58.520 --> 2:09:01.400\n I'm ready to face the rough burning truth\n\n2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:04.360\n rather than waste the rest of my youth.\n\n2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:07.240\n So tell me, my lover, should I stay or go?\n\n2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:09.800\n The answer to love is one, yes or no.\n\n2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:12.480\n There's no I like you, no let's be friends,\n\n2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:15.120\n shout out I love you, or send me to hell.\n\n2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:21.600\n I don't think there's a better way to end\n\n2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:23.320\n a discussion of the meaning of life.\n\n2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:25.720\n Whatever the heck the meaning is,\n\n2:09:25.720 --> 2:09:28.720\n go all in as that poem says.\n\n2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:30.480\n Manolis, thank you so much for talking today.\n\n2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:32.800\n Thanks, I look forward

words\n\n2:10:11.480 --> 2:10:13.440\n from Douglas Adams in his book,\n\n2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:16.160\n Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\n\n2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:19.440\n On the planet Earth, man had always assumed\n\n2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:22.160\n that he was more intelligent than dolphins\n\n2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:24.480\n because he had achieved so much.\n\n2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:28.720\n The wheel, New York, wars, and so on,\n\n2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:31.240\n whilst all the dolphins had ever done\n\n2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:34.920\n was muck about in the water having a good time.\n\n2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:38.600\n But conversely, the dolphins had always believed\n\n2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:41.480\n that they were far more intelligent than man\n\n2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:43.940\n for precisely the same reasons.\n\n2:10:43.940 --> 2:11:04.940\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
