And likewise, there's no reason to\n\n00:05.600 --> 00:12.800\n think that the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,\n\n00:12.800 --> 00:17.280\n there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.\n\n00:18.080 --> 00:24.800\n It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there's\n\n00:24.800 --> 00:32.160\n another set of people like us sitting in a room like this. The following is a conversation with\n\n00:32.160 --> 00:38.080\n Lord Martin Rees, Emeritus Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics at Cambridge University and\n\n00:38.080 --> 00:43.840\n co founder of the Center for the Study of Existential Risk. This is the Lex Friedman\n\n00:43.840 --> 00:48.560\n podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,\n\n00:48.560 --> 00:55.280\n dear friends, here's Martin Rees. In your 2020 Scientific American article,\n\n00:55.280 --> 01:00.960\n you write that, quote, today we know that the universe is far bigger and stranger than anyone\n\n01:00.960 --> 01:07.200\n suspected. So what do you think are the strangest, maybe the most beautiful, or maybe even the most\n\n01:07.200 --> 01:13.600\n terrifying things lurking out there in the cosmos? Well, of course, we're still groping for any\n\n01:13.600 --> 01:19.680\n detailed understanding of the remote parts of the universe. But of course, what we've learned in the\n\n01:19.680 --> 01:25.760\n last few decades is really two things. First, we've understood that the universe had an origin\n\n01:26.400 --> 01:33.120\n about 13.8 billion years ago, in a so called Big Bang, a hot 10 states, whose very beginnings are\n\n01:33.120 --> 01:39.680\n still shrouded in mystery. And also, we've learned more about the extreme things in it, black holes,\n\n01:39.680 --> 01:46.720\n neutron stars, explosions of various kinds. And one of the most potentially exciting discoveries\n\n01:46.720 --> 01:53.360\n in the last 20 years, mainly in the last 10, has been the realization that most of the stars in the\n\n01:53.360 --> 02:00.160\n sky are orbited by retinues of planets, just as the Sun is orbited by the Earth and the other\n\n02:00.160 --> 02:05.360\n familiar planets. And this, of course, makes the night sky far more interesting. What you see up\n\n02:05.360 --> 02:10.320\n there aren't just points of light, but they're planetary systems. And that raises the question,\n\n02:10.320 --> 02:15.840\n could there be life out there? And so that is an exciting problem for the 21st century.\n\n02:15.840 --> 02:21.760\n So when you see all those lights out there, you immediately imagine all the planetary worlds that\n\n02:21.760 --> 02:29.360\n are around them, and they potentially have all kinds of different lives, living organisms,\n\n02:29.360 --> 02:32.640\n life forms or different histories. Well, that we don't know at all. We know\n\n02:32.640 --> 02:39.760\n that these planets are there. We know that they have masses and orbits rather like the\n\n02:39.760 --> 02:44.880\n planets of our solar system. But we don't know at all if there's any life on any of them. I mean,\n\n02:44.880 --> 02:50.160\n it's entirely logically possible that life is unique to this Earth, doesn't exist anywhere.\n\n02:50.160 --> 02:56.080\n On the other hand, it could be that the origin of life is something which happens routinely given\n\n02:56.080 --> 03:00.800\n conditions like the young Earth, in which case there could be literally billions of places in\n\n03:00.800 --> 03:07.680\n our galaxy where some sort of biosphere has evolved. And settling where the truth lies\n\n03:07.680 --> 03:11.680\n between those two extremes is a challenge for the coming decades.\n\n03:12.720 --> 03:18.880\n So certainly we're either lucky to be here or very, very, very lucky to be here.\n\n03:18.880 --> 03:25.280\n I guess that's the difference. Where do you fall? Your own estimate,\n\n03:25.280 --> 03:29.200\n your own guess on this question. Are we alone in the universe, do you think?\n\n03:29.200 --> 03:35.360\n I think we're foolish to give any firm estimate because we just don't know. And that's just an\n\n03:35.360 --> 03:40.880\n example of how we are depending on greater observations. And also, incidentally,\n\n03:40.880 --> 03:47.120\n in the case of life, we've got to take account of the fact that, as I always say to my scientific\n\n03:47.120 --> 03:54.080\n colleagues, biology is a much harder subject than physics. And most of the universe that we know\n\n03:54.080 --> 03:59.680\n about could be understood by physics. But we've got to remember that even the smallest living\n\n03:59.680 --> 04:08.400\n organism, an insect, is far more complicated with layer on layer complexity than the most\n\n04:08.400 --> 04:13.280\n complicated star or galaxy. That's the funny thing about physics\n\n04:13.280 --> 04:19.920\n and biology. The dream of physicists in the 20th century and maybe this century is to discover\n\n04:19.920 --> 04:27.760\n the theory of everything. And there's a sense that once you discover that theory,\n\n04:27.760 --> 04:32.160\n you will understand everything. If we unlock the mysteries of how the universe works,\n\n04:32.160 --> 04:39.680\n would you be able to understand how life emerges from that fabric of the universe that we understand?\n\n04:39.680 --> 04:45.840\n I think the phrase, theory of everything, is very misleading because it's used to describe\n\n04:45.840 --> 04:52.080\n a theory which unifies the three laws of microphysics, electricity,\n\n04:52.080 --> 04:57.920\n magnetism, and weak interaction with gravity. So it's an important step forward for particle\n\n04:57.920 --> 05:04.400\n physicists. But the lack of such a theory doesn't hold up any other scientists. Anyone doing\n\n05:04.400 --> 05:10.240\n biology or most of physics is not held up at all through not understanding subnuclear physics.\n\n05:10.240 --> 05:12.880\n They're held up because they're dealing with things that are very complicated.\n\n05:12.880 --> 05:18.720\n And that's especially true of anything biological. So what's holding up biologists is not a lack of\n\n05:18.720 --> 05:23.920\n the so called theory of everything. It's the inability to understand things which are very\n\n05:23.920 --> 05:30.000\n complicated. What do you think we'll understand first? How the universe works or how the human\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:36.800\n body works deeply, like from a fundamental deep level? Well, I think, perhaps we can come back to\n\n05:36.800 --> 05:44.800\n it later, that there are only limited prospects of ever being able to understand with unaided human\n\n05:44.800 --> 05:51.120\n brains the most fundamental theories linking together all the forces of nature. I think that\n\n05:51.120 --> 05:58.960\n may be a limitation of the human brains. But I also think that we can, perhaps aided by computer\n\n05:58.960 --> 06:06.640\n simulations, understand a bit more of the complexity of nature. But even understanding a\n\n06:06.640 --> 06:15.040\n simple organism from the atom up is very, very difficult. And I think extreme reductionists have\n\n06:15.040 --> 06:20.960\n a very misleading perception. They tend to think that, in a sense, we are all solutions to\n\n06:20.960 --> 06:28.000\n Schrodinger's equation, etc. But that isn't the way we'll ever understand anything. It may be true\n\n06:28.000 --> 06:34.960\n that we are reductionists in the sense that we believe that that's the case. We don't believe in\n\n06:34.960 --> 06:40.240\n any special life force in living things. But nonetheless, no one thinks that we can understand\n\n06:40.240 --> 06:46.320\n a living thing by solving Schrodinger's equation. To take an example which isn't as complicated,\n\n06:46.320 --> 06:52.720\n lots of people study the flow of fluids like water, why waves break, why flows go turbulent,\n\n06:52.720 --> 06:59.120\n things like that. This is a serious branch of applied mathematics and engineering. And in doing\n\n06:59.120 --> 07:06.000\n this, you have concepts of viscosity, turbulence, and things like that. Now, you can understand\n\n07:06.000 --> 07:13.280\n quite a lot about how water behaves and how waves break in terms of those concepts. But the fact\n\n07:13.280 --> 07:20.320\n that any breaking wave is a solution of Schrodinger's equation for 10 to the 30 particles,\n\n07:20.320 --> 07:26.080\n even if you could solve that, which you clearly can't, would not give you any insight.\n\n07:26.080 --> 07:30.560\n So the important thing is that every science has its own irreducible concepts\n\n07:32.080 --> 07:37.840\n in which you get the best explanation. So it may be in chemistry, it's things like valence.\n\n07:38.720 --> 07:47.280\n In biology, there are concepts in cell biology. And in ecology, there are concepts like\n\n07:47.280 --> 07:54.800\n imprinting, etc. And in psychology, there are other concepts. So in a sense, the sciences are\n\n07:55.520 --> 08:01.920\n like a tall building where you have basic physics, most fundamental, then the rest of\n\n08:01.920 --> 08:08.160\n physics, then chemistry, then cell biology, etc., all the way up to the, I guess, economist in the\n\n08:08.160 --> 08:15.920\n penthouse and all that. And we have that. And that's true in a sense. But it's not true that\n\n08:15.920 --> 08:23.600\n it's like a building in that it's made unstable by an unstable base. Because if you're a chemist,\n\n08:23.600 --> 08:27.040\n biologist, or an economist, you're facing challenging problems.\n\n08:27.760 --> 08:32.240\n But they're not made any worse by uncertainty about subnuclear physics.\n\n08:33.120 --> 08:37.840\n TK And at every level, just because you understand the rules of the game,\n\n08:37.840 --> 08:40.720\n or have some understanding of the rules of the game, doesn't\n\n08:40.720 --> 08:46.160\n TK mean you know what kind of beautiful things that game creates.\n\n08:46.160 --> 08:55.200\n TK Right. So if you're interested in birds and how they fly, then things like imprinting\n\n08:56.240 --> 09:01.920\n the baby on the mother and all that, and things like that, are what you need to understand.\n\n09:02.800 --> 09:08.160\n You couldn't even in principle solve this fairly good equation, how an albatross\n\n09:08.160 --> 09:12.400\n wanders for thousands of miles in the Southern Ocean and comes back and then coughs up\n\n09:12.400 --> 09:15.920\n food for its young. That's something we can understand, in a sense,\n\n09:16.480 --> 09:21.360\n and predict the behavior. But it's not because we can solve it on the atomic scale.\n\n09:21.360 --> 09:25.840\n TK You mentioned that there might be some fundamental limitation to the human brain\n\n09:26.720 --> 09:32.080\n that limits our ability to understand some aspect of how the universe works. That's really\n\n09:32.080 --> 09:39.600\n interesting. That's sad, actually. To the degree it's true, it's sad. So what do you mean by that?\n\n09:39.600 --> 09:46.000\n TK I would simply say that just as a monkey can't understand quantum theory or even Newtonian\n\n09:46.000 --> 09:52.400\n physics, there's no particular reason why the human brain should have evolved to be well matched\n\n09:52.400 --> 09:59.120\n to understanding the deepest aspects of reality. And I suspect that there may be aspects that we\n\n09:59.120 --> 10:02.720\n are not even aware of and couldn't really fully comprehend.\n\n10:03.280 --> 10:07.200\n But as an intermediate step towards that, one thing which I think is a very interesting\n\n10:07.200 --> 10:13.840\n possibility is the extent to which AI can help us. I mean, I think if you take the example of\n\n10:14.640 --> 10:17.520\n so called theories of everything, one of which is string theory.\n\n10:18.480 --> 10:24.880\n String theory involves very complicated geometry and structures in 10 dimensions.\n\n10:24.880 --> 10:35.040\n And it's certainly, in my view on the cards, that the physics of 10 dimensions,\n\n10:36.480 --> 10:41.680\n very complicated geometry, may be too hard for a human being to work through,\n\n10:42.400 --> 10:50.640\n but could be worked through by an AI with the advantage of the huge processing power,\n\n10:50.640 --> 10:55.600\n which enables them to learn world championship chess within a few hours just by watching games.\n\n10:55.600 --> 11:02.800\n So there's every reason to expect that these machines could help us to solve these problems.\n\n11:02.800 --> 11:08.000\n And of course, if that's the way we came to understand whether string theory was right,\n\n11:08.000 --> 11:13.120\n it should be in a sense frustrating because you wouldn't get the sort of aha insight,\n\n11:13.120 --> 11:19.040\n which is the greatest satisfaction from doing science. But on the other hand, if a machine\n\n11:19.040 --> 11:26.560\n churns away at 10 dimensional geometry, figuring out all the possible origamis wound up in extra\n\n11:26.560 --> 11:32.960\n dimensions, if it comes out at the end, spews out the correct mass of the electron, the fact that\n\n11:32.960 --> 11:36.960\n there are three kinds of neutrinos, something like that, you would know that there was some truth in\n\n11:36.960 --> 11:43.200\n the theory. And so we may have a theory which we come to trust because it does predict things that\n\n11:43.200 --> 11:49.760\n we can observe and check, but we may never really understand the full workings of it to the extent\n\n11:49.760 --> 11:57.840\n that we do more or less understand how most phenomena can be explained in a fundamental way.\n\n11:57.840 --> 12:00.400\n Of course, in the case of quantum theory, many people would say,\n\n12:01.120 --> 12:04.640\n understand if there's still some mystery, if you don't quite understand why it works.\n\n12:04.640 --> 12:09.200\n But there could be deeper mysteries when we get to these unified theories, where there's a big gap\n\n12:09.200 --> 12:16.560\n between what a computer can print out for us at the end and what we can actually grasp and think\n\n12:16.560 --> 12:21.280\n through in our heads. Yeah, it's interesting that the idea that there could be things a computer\n\n12:21.280 --> 12:29.040\n could tell us that is true. And maybe it can even help us understand why it's true a little bit,\n\n12:29.040 --> 12:34.400\n but ultimately it's still a long journey to really deeply understand the whys of it.\n\n12:34.400 --> 12:40.800\n Yes, and that's the limitation of our brain. We can try to sneak up to it in different ways,\n\n12:40.800 --> 12:45.680\n given the limitations of our brain. I've gotten a chance to spend the day at DeepMind,\n\n12:45.680 --> 12:52.320\n talk to Demis Hassabis. His big dream is to apply AI to the questions of science,\n\n12:52.320 --> 12:55.840\n certainly to the questions of physics. Have you gotten a chance to interact with him?\n\n12:55.840 --> 12:59.520\n Well, I know him quite well. He's one of my heroes, certainly.\n\n12:59.520 --> 13:02.080\n I'm sure he would say the same.\n\n13:02.080 --> 13:07.280\n And I remember the first time I met him, he said that he was like me, he wants to understand the\n\n13:07.280 --> 13:12.880\n universe, but he thought the best thing to do was to try and develop AI. And then with the help of\n\n13:12.880 --> 13:17.360\n AI, he'd stand more chance of understanding the universe. And I think he's right about that.\n\n13:18.080 --> 13:26.640\n And of course, although we're familiar with the way his computers play go and chess,\n\n13:26.640 --> 13:33.040\n he's already made contributions to science through understanding protein folding better\n\n13:33.040 --> 13:40.240\n than the best human chemists. And so already he's on the path to showing ways in which computers\n\n13:40.240 --> 13:45.840\n have the power to learn and do things by having ability to analyze enormous samples in a short\n\n13:45.840 --> 13:52.240\n time to do better than humans. And so I think he would resonate for what I just said, that it may\n\n13:52.240 --> 13:57.280\n be that in these other fundamental questions, the computers will play a crucial role.\n\n13:58.080 --> 14:02.720\n Yeah. And they're also doing a quantum mechanical simulation of electrons. They're doing\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:07.760\n control of high temperature plasmas, fusion reactors.\n\n14:07.760 --> 14:11.520\n Yes, that's a new thing, which is very interesting. They can suppress the instabilities\n\n14:11.520 --> 14:14.880\n in these tokamaks better than any other way. Yeah.\n\n14:14.880 --> 14:24.720\n And it's just the march of progress by AIs in science is making big strides. Do you think\n\n14:24.720 --> 14:28.800\n an AI system will win a Nobel Prize in the century? What do you think?\n\n14:31.520 --> 14:33.520\n And does that make you sad?\n\n14:33.520 --> 14:38.240\n If I can digress and put in a plug for my next book, it has a chapter saying,\n\n14:38.240 --> 14:43.760\n why Nobel Prizes do more harm than good. So on a quite separate subject, I think\n\n14:43.760 --> 14:49.120\n the Nobel Prizes do a great deal of damage to the perception of the way science is done.\n\n14:49.120 --> 14:53.760\n Of course, if you ask who or what deserves the credit for any scientific discovery,\n\n14:53.760 --> 14:58.960\n it may be often someone who has an idea, a team of people who work a big experiment, etc.\n\n14:59.600 --> 15:07.360\n And of course, it's the quality of the equipment, which is crucial. And certainly in the subjects\n\n15:07.360 --> 15:15.120\n I do in astronomy, the huge advances we've had come not from us being more intelligent than\n\n15:15.120 --> 15:22.240\n Aristotle was, but through us having far, far better data from powerful telescopes on the\n\n15:22.240 --> 15:29.040\n ground and in space. And also, incidentally, we've benefited hugely in astronomy from computer\n\n15:29.040 --> 15:36.960\n simulations. Because if you are a subatomic physicist, then of course, you crash together\n\n15:36.960 --> 15:43.280\n the particles in the big accelerator like the one at CERN and see what happens. But I can't\n\n15:43.280 --> 15:48.880\n crash together two galaxies or two stars and see what happens. But in the virtual world of a\n\n15:48.880 --> 15:56.160\n computer, one can do simulations like that. And the power of computers is such that these\n\n15:56.160 --> 16:05.840\n simulations can yield phenomena and insights which we wouldn't have guessed beforehand. And the way\n\n16:05.840 --> 16:11.280\n we can feel we're making progress and trying to understand some of these phenomena, why galaxies\n\n16:11.280 --> 16:16.880\n have the size and shape they do and all that, is because we can do simulations and tweaking\n\n16:16.880 --> 16:22.560\n different initial conditions and seeing which gives the best fit to what we actually observe.\n\n16:22.560 --> 16:30.720\n And so that's a way in which we've made progress in using computers. And incidentally, we also now\n\n16:30.720 --> 16:34.880\n need to analyze data because one thinks of astronomy as being traditionally rather data\n\n16:34.880 --> 16:43.840\n poor subjects. But the European satellite called Gaia has just put online the speeds and colors\n\n16:43.840 --> 16:50.560\n and properties of nearly two billion stars in the Milky Way, which we can do fantastic analyses of.\n\n16:50.560 --> 16:54.320\n And that, of course, could not be done at all without just the number crunching capacity\n\n16:54.320 --> 17:01.280\n of computers. And the new methods of machine learning actually love raw data, the kind that\n\n17:01.280 --> 17:06.640\n astronomy provides, organized, structured, raw data. Well, indeed, because the reason they really\n\n17:06.640 --> 17:12.720\n have a benefit over us is that they can learn and think so much faster. That's how they can\n\n17:12.720 --> 17:17.920\n learn to play chess and go. That's how they can learn to diagnose lung cancer better than a\n\n17:17.920 --> 17:26.400\n radiologist because they can look at 100,000 scans in a few days, whereas no human radiologist sees\n\n17:26.400 --> 17:33.040\n that many a lifetime. Well, there's still magic to the human intelligence, to the intuition,\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:40.480\n to the common sense reasoning. Well, we hope so. For now. What is the new book that you mentioned?\n\n17:40.480 --> 17:44.880\n The book I mentioned is called If Science is to Save Us. It's coming out in September.\n\n17:44.880 --> 17:56.560\n And it's on the big challenges of science, climate, dealing with biosafety and dealing\n\n17:56.560 --> 18:03.840\n with cyber safety. And also, it's got chapters on the way science is organized, universities\n\n18:03.840 --> 18:12.560\n and academies, et cetera, and the ethics of science and education. And the limits, yes.\n\n18:12.560 --> 18:18.080\n Yes. Well, let me actually just stroll around the beautiful and the strange of the universe.\n\n18:18.960 --> 18:24.800\n Over 20 years ago, you hypothesized that we would solve the mystery of dark matter by now.\n\n18:25.760 --> 18:34.320\n So unfortunately, we didn't quite yet. First, what is dark matter and why has it been so tough\n\n18:34.320 --> 18:39.520\n to figure out? Well, I mean, we learned that galaxies and other large scale structures,\n\n18:39.520 --> 18:50.720\n which are moving around but preventive of flying apart by gravity, would be flying apart if they\n\n18:50.720 --> 18:57.520\n only contain the stuff we see, if everything in them is shining. And to understand how galaxies\n\n18:57.520 --> 19:06.000\n formed and why they do remain confined the same size, one has to infer that there's about five\n\n19:06.000 --> 19:12.720\n times as much stuff producing gravitational forces than the total amount of stuff in the\n\n19:12.720 --> 19:18.960\n gas and stars that we see. And that stuff is called dark matter. That's the leading name,\n\n19:18.960 --> 19:26.560\n it's not dark, it's just transparent, et cetera. And the most likely interpretation is that it's\n\n19:26.560 --> 19:34.480\n a swarm of microscopic particles which have no electric charge. And the very small cross sections\n\n19:34.480 --> 19:39.680\n were hitting each other and hitting anything else. So they swarm around and we can detect their\n\n19:39.680 --> 19:44.880\n collective effects. And when we do computer simulations of how galaxies form and evolve\n\n19:45.680 --> 19:52.240\n and how they emerge from the Big Bang, then we get a nice consistent picture if we put in\n\n19:53.680 --> 20:01.520\n five times as much mass in the form of these mysterious dark particles. And for instance,\n\n20:01.520 --> 20:05.840\n it works better if we think they're not interacting particles than if you think they're a gas which\n\n20:05.840 --> 20:09.760\n would have shockwaves and things. So we know something about the properties of these, but we\n\n20:09.760 --> 20:16.400\n don't know what they are. And the disappointment compared to my guess 20 years ago is that\n\n20:17.120 --> 20:21.440\n particles answering this description have not yet been found. It was thought that the\n\n20:21.440 --> 20:26.000\n big accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which is the world's biggest,\n\n20:26.000 --> 20:30.560\n might have found a new class of particles which would have been the obvious candidates.\n\n20:30.560 --> 20:38.160\n And it hasn't. And some people say, well, dark matter can't be there, etc. But what I would argue\n\n20:38.160 --> 20:44.800\n is that there's a huge amount of parameter space that hasn't been explored. There are other kinds\n\n20:44.800 --> 20:49.920\n of particles called axions which behave slightly differently, which are good candidates. And\n\n20:50.640 --> 20:58.000\n there's a factor of 10 powers of 10 between the heaviest particles that could be created by\n\n20:58.000 --> 21:03.680\n the Large Hadron Collider and the heaviest particles which on theoretical grounds could exist\n\n21:04.560 --> 21:09.920\n without turning into black holes. So there's a huge amount of possible particles which could be\n\n21:09.920 --> 21:16.160\n out there as remnants of the Big Bang, but which we wouldn't be able to detect so easily. So the\n\n21:16.160 --> 21:22.320\n fact that we've got new constraints on what the dark matter could be doesn't diminish my belief\n\n21:22.320 --> 21:27.120\n that it's there in the form of particles because we've only explored a small fraction of parameter\n\n21:27.120 --> 21:35.680\n space. So there's this search, you're literally, upon an unintended, are searching in the dark\n\n21:36.480 --> 21:41.360\n here in this giant parameter space of possible particles. You're searching for, I mean,\n\n21:41.360 --> 21:46.240\n there could be all kinds of particles. There could be, and there's some which may be very,\n\n21:46.240 --> 21:53.920\n very hard to detect. But I think we can hope for some new theoretical ideas because one point which\n\n21:53.920 --> 21:58.000\n perhaps we'd like to discuss more is about the very early stages of the Big Bang.\n\n21:58.800 --> 22:05.600\n And the situation now is that we have an outline picture for how the universe has evolved from\n\n22:06.160 --> 22:12.640\n the time when it was expanding in just a nanosecond up to the present. And we could do\n\n22:12.640 --> 22:20.880\n that because after nanosecond, the physics of the material is in the same range that we can test in\n\n22:20.880 --> 22:27.920\n the lab. After a nanosecond, the particles move around like those in the Large Hadron Collider.\n\n22:27.920 --> 22:34.000\n If you wait for one second, they're rather like in the centers of the hottest stars. And nuclear\n\n22:34.000 --> 22:38.720\n reactions produce hydrogen, helium, et cetera, which fit the data. So we can with confidence\n\n22:38.720 --> 22:43.200\n extrapolate back to when the universe was a nanosecond old. Indeed, I think we can do it with\n\n22:43.200 --> 22:47.760\n as much confidence as anything a geologist tells you about the early history of the Earth.\n\n22:47.760 --> 22:56.080\n And that's huge progress in the last 50 years. But any progress puts in sharper focus new mysteries.\n\n22:56.080 --> 23:02.880\n And of course, the new mysteries in this context are, why is the universe expanding the way it is?\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:09.680\n Why does it contain this mixture of atoms and dark matter and radiation? And why does it have\n\n23:10.480 --> 23:15.040\n the properties which allow galaxies to form, being fairly smooth but not completely smooth?\n\n23:15.040 --> 23:21.440\n And the answer to those questions, I generally believe, to lie in a much, much earlier stage\n\n23:21.440 --> 23:27.840\n of the universe, when conditions were much more extreme, and therefore far beyond the stage where\n\n23:27.840 --> 23:33.440\n we have the foothold in experiments. Very theoretical. And so we don't have a convincing\n\n23:33.440 --> 23:38.320\n theory. We just have ideas. Until we have something like string theory or some other\n\n23:38.320 --> 23:44.400\n clues to the ultra early universe, that's going to remain speculative. So there's a big gap.\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:50.880\n And to say how big the gap is, if we take the observable universe out of a bit more than 10\n\n23:50.880 --> 23:57.840\n billion light years, then when the universe was a nanosecond old, that would have been squeezed down\n\n23:57.840 --> 24:05.360\n to the size of our solar system, or compressed into that volume. But the times we're talking\n\n24:05.360 --> 24:11.600\n about when the key properties of the universe were first imprinted were times when that entire\n\n24:11.600 --> 24:18.000\n universe was squeezed down to the size of a tennis ball, or baseball if you prefer, and it emerged\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:23.280\n from something microscopic. So it's a huge extrapolation. And it's not surprising that,\n\n24:24.000 --> 24:30.400\n since it's so far from our experimental range of detectability, we are still groping for ideas.\n\n24:30.400 --> 24:38.400\n TG But you think first theory will reach into that place, and then experiment will perhaps\n\n24:38.400 --> 24:42.560\n one day catch up, maybe simulation. JG Well, I think in a sense it's a combination. I think\n\n24:43.360 --> 24:50.720\n what we hope for is that there'll be a theory which applies to the early universe,\n\n24:51.760 --> 25:00.400\n which also has consequences which we can test in our present day universe, like discovering\n\n25:00.400 --> 25:05.200\n why neutrinos exist or things like that. And that's the thing which, as I mentioned,\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:11.200\n we may perhaps need a bit of AI to help us to calculate. But I think the hope would be\n\n25:11.760 --> 25:18.000\n that we will have a theory which applies under the very, very extreme early stages of the universe,\n\n25:18.000 --> 25:23.440\n but which gains credibility and gains confidence, because it also manages to account for otherwise\n\n25:23.440 --> 25:29.040\n unexplained features of the low energy world, what people call the standard model of particle\n\n25:29.040 --> 25:35.680\n physics, where there are lots of undetermined numbers. So it may help with that. TG So we're\n\n25:35.680 --> 25:42.640\n dancing between physics and philosophy a little bit, but what do you think happened before the\n\n25:42.640 --> 25:49.200\n Big Bang? So this feels like something that's out of the reach of science. JG It's out of the reach\n\n25:49.200 --> 25:55.920\n of present science, because science develops and as the front is advanced, then new problems come\n\n25:55.920 --> 26:00.240\n into focus that couldn't even have been postulated before. I mean, if I think of my own career,\n\n26:00.240 --> 26:07.120\n when I was a student, the evidence for the Big Bang was pretty weak, whereas now it's extremely\n\n26:07.120 --> 26:13.760\n strong. But we are now thinking about the reason why the universe is the way it is and all that.\n\n26:14.400 --> 26:21.120\n So I would put all these things we've just mentioned in the category of speculative science.\n\n26:21.120 --> 26:27.760\n And I don't see a bifurcation between that and philosophy. But of course, to answer your question,\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:33.440\n if we do want to understand the very early universe, then we've got to realize that\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:40.320\n it may involve even more counterintuitive concepts than quantum theory does, because it's a\n\n26:40.320 --> 26:47.120\n condition even further away from everyday world than quantum theory is. And remember, our lives,\n\n26:47.120 --> 26:55.200\n our brains evolved and haven't changed much since our ancestors roamed the African savanna and\n\n26:55.200 --> 27:00.160\n looked at the everyday world. And it's rather amazing that we've been able to make some sense\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:06.000\n of the quantum micro world and of the cosmos. But there may be some things which are beyond us. And\n\n27:06.000 --> 27:11.520\n certainly, as you implied, there are things that we don't yet understand at all. And of course,\n\n27:11.520 --> 27:18.320\n one concept we might have to jettison is the idea of three dimensions of space and time just ticking\n\n27:18.320 --> 27:24.800\n away. There are lots of ideas. I mean, I think Stephen Hawking had an idea. They're talking about\n\n27:26.880 --> 27:30.960\n what happened before the Big Bang. It's like asking what happens if you go north from the\n\n27:30.960 --> 27:37.040\n North Pole. It somehow closes off. That's just one idea. I don't like that idea, but that's a\n\n27:37.040 --> 27:44.880\n possible one. And so we just don't know what happened at the very beginning of the Big Bang,\n\n27:45.440 --> 27:53.280\n were there many Big Bangs rather than one, etc. And those are issues which we may be able to\n\n27:53.840 --> 28:04.080\n get some foothold on from some new theory. But even then, we won't be able to directly\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:10.880\n test the theories. But I think it's a heresy to think you have to be able to test every prediction\n\n28:10.880 --> 28:16.960\n of a theory. Let me give you another example. We take seriously what Einstein's theory says\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:23.120\n about the inside of black holes, even though we can't observe them, because that theory has been\n\n28:23.120 --> 28:28.880\n vindicated in many other places in cosmology and black holes, gravitational waves, and all those\n\n28:28.880 --> 28:36.160\n things. Likewise, if we had a theory which explains some things about the early history\n\n28:36.160 --> 28:43.440\n of our Big Bang and the present universe, then we would take seriously the inference if it\n\n28:43.440 --> 28:48.400\n predicted many Big Bangs, not one, even though we can't predict the other ones. So the example is\n\n28:49.040 --> 28:54.880\n we can take seriously a prediction if it's the consequence of a theory that we believe\n\n28:54.880 --> 29:00.880\n on other grounds. We don't need to be able to detect another Big Bang in order to take it\n\n29:00.880 --> 29:08.560\n seriously. It may not be a proof, but it's a good indication that this is the direction where the\n\n29:08.560 --> 29:14.400\n truth lies. Yeah, if the theory is getting confidence in other ways. Where do you sense?\n\n29:14.400 --> 29:20.800\n Do you think there's other universes besides our own? There are sort of well defined theories which\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:26.800\n make assumptions about the physics at the relevant time, and this time, incidentally,\n\n29:26.800 --> 29:33.520\n is 10 to the power minus 36 seconds or earlier than that, so this tiny sliver of time.\n\n29:34.720 --> 29:41.360\n There are some theories, a famous one due to Andrei Linde, the Russian cosmologist now at\n\n29:41.360 --> 29:48.640\n Stanford, called eternal inflation, which did predict an eternal production of new Big Bangs,\n\n29:48.640 --> 29:54.800\n as it were, and that's based on specific assumptions about the physics. But those\n\n29:54.800 --> 29:59.840\n assumptions, of course, are just hypotheses which aren't vindicated. But there are other\n\n29:59.840 --> 30:06.480\n theories which only predict one Big Bang. So I think we should be open minded and not dogmatic\n\n30:06.480 --> 30:12.880\n about these options until we do understand the relevant physics. But there are these different\n\n30:12.880 --> 30:19.920\n scenarios of very different ideas about this. But I think all of them have the feature that\n\n30:19.920 --> 30:24.800\n physical reality is a lot more extensive than what we can see through our telescope. I think\n\n30:24.800 --> 30:31.280\n even most conservative astronomers would say that because we can see out with our telescopes to a\n\n30:31.280 --> 30:38.800\n sort of horizon, which is about, depending on how you measure it, maybe 15 billion light years away\n\n30:38.800 --> 30:45.840\n or something like that. But that horizon of observations is no more physical reality than\n\n30:45.840 --> 30:53.760\n the horizon around you if you're in the ocean and looking out at your horizon. There's no reason to\n\n30:53.760 --> 30:58.800\n think that the ocean ends just beyond your horizon. And likewise, there's no reason to think that\n\n30:59.360 --> 31:05.600\n the aftermath of our Big Bang ends just at the boundary of what we can see. Indeed,\n\n31:05.600 --> 31:10.080\n there are quite strong arguments that it probably goes on about 100 times further.\n\n31:10.880 --> 31:17.600\n It may even go on so much further that all combinatorials are replicated. And there's\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:26.640\n another set of people like us sitting in a room like this. That's not logically impossible.\n\n31:27.520 --> 31:35.040\n But I think many people would accept that it does go on and contain probably a million times\n\n31:35.040 --> 31:40.240\n as much stuff as what we can see within a horizon. The reason for that, incidentally,\n\n31:40.240 --> 31:44.000\n is that if we look as far as we can in one direction and in the opposite direction,\n\n31:44.960 --> 31:50.640\n then the conditions don't differ by more than one part in 100,000. So that means that if we're part\n\n31:50.640 --> 31:56.400\n of some finite structure, the gradient across the part we can see is very small. And so that\n\n31:56.400 --> 32:01.440\n suggests that it probably does go on a lot further. And the best estimates say it must\n\n32:01.440 --> 32:07.520\n go on at least 20 times further. LR \u2013 Is that exciting or terrifying to you?\n\n32:07.520 --> 32:13.600\n Just the spans of it all, the wide, everything that lies beyond the horizon.\n\n32:15.360 --> 32:20.080\n That example doesn't even hold for Earth, so it goes way, way farther. And on top of that,\n\n32:20.080 --> 32:25.840\n just to take your metaphor further on the ocean, while we're on top of this ocean,\n\n32:25.840 --> 32:31.760\n not only can we not see beyond the horizon, we also don't know much about the depth of the ocean,\n\n32:31.760 --> 32:36.560\n nor the actual mechanism of observation that's in our head.\n\n32:36.560 --> 32:59.360\n RL \u2013 I don't think the perception of this utterly vast cosmos need have any deeper impact\n\n32:59.360 --> 33:04.000\n on us than just realizing that we are very small on the scale of the external world.\n\n33:04.000 --> 33:13.120\n LR \u2013 Yeah, it's humbling though. It's humbling, depending where your ego is, it's humbling.\n\n33:13.120 --> 33:17.680\n RL \u2013 Well, if you start off very unhumble indeed, it may make a difference. But for most of us,\n\n33:17.680 --> 33:22.720\n I don't think it makes much of a difference. Well, there's a more general question, of course,\n\n33:22.720 --> 33:34.400\n about whether the human race as such is something which is very special, or if on the other hand,\n\n33:34.400 --> 33:42.080\n it's just one of many such species elsewhere in the universe, or indeed existing at different\n\n33:42.080 --> 33:48.160\n times in our universe. LR \u2013 To me, it feels almost obvious\n\n33:48.160 --> 33:53.920\n that the universe should be full of alien life, perhaps dead alien civilizations, but\n\n33:54.560 --> 34:04.160\n just the vastness of space. And it just feels wrong to think of Earth as somehow special. It\n\n34:04.160 --> 34:09.680\n sure as heck doesn't look that special. The more we learn, the less special it seems.\n\n34:09.680 --> 34:16.560\n RL \u2013 Well, I mean, I don't agree with that as far as life is concerned, because remember that\n\n34:16.560 --> 34:22.240\n we don't understand how life began here on Earth. We don't understand, although we know there were\n\n34:22.240 --> 34:28.160\n any evolution of simple life to complex life, we don't understand what caused the transition\n\n34:28.160 --> 34:34.880\n between complex chemistry and the first replicating, metabolizing entity we call alive.\n\n34:35.360 --> 34:42.720\n That's a mystery, and serious physicists and chemists are now thinking about it,\n\n34:42.720 --> 34:50.400\n but we don't know. So we therefore can't say, was it a rare fluke which would not have happened\n\n34:50.400 --> 34:57.200\n anywhere else, or was it something which involves a process that would have happened in any other\n\n34:57.200 --> 35:04.080\n planet where conditions were like they were on the young Earth? So we can't say that now. I think\n\n35:04.880 --> 35:11.920\n many of us would indeed bet that probably some kind of life exists elsewhere. But even if you\n\n35:11.920 --> 35:18.320\n accept that, then there are many contingencies going from simple life to present day life.\n\n35:18.960 --> 35:24.720\n Some biologists like Stephen Jay Gould thought that if you reround evolution,\n\n35:24.720 --> 35:28.800\n you'd end up with something quite different, and maybe not with an intelligent species. So\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:34.880\n the contingencies in evolution may militate against the emergence of intelligence,\n\n35:35.520 --> 35:40.320\n even if life gets started in lots of places. So I think these are still completely open questions,\n\n35:40.320 --> 35:45.120\n and that's why it's such an exciting time now that we are starting to be able to address these.\n\n35:45.120 --> 35:51.680\n I mentioned the fact that the origin of life is a question that we may be able to understand,\n\n35:52.720 --> 35:56.720\n and serious people are working on it. It used to be put in a sort of too difficult box. Everyone\n\n35:56.720 --> 36:00.240\n knew it was important, but they didn't know how to tackle it or what experiments to do.\n\n36:00.240 --> 36:06.240\n But it's not like that now. That's partly because of clever experiments, but I think most\n\n36:06.240 --> 36:13.120\n importantly because we are aware that we can look for life in other places, other places in our\n\n36:13.120 --> 36:20.240\n solar system, and of course, on the exoplanets around other stars. And within 10 or 20 years,\n\n36:20.800 --> 36:25.840\n I think two things could happen, which would be really, really important. We might,\n\n36:25.840 --> 36:32.960\n with the next big telescope, be able to image some of the Earth like planets around other stars.\n\n36:32.960 --> 36:36.240\n TG. Image, like get a picture?\n\n36:36.240 --> 36:40.640\n MR. Well, actually, caveat that, it'd take 50 years to get a resolved image,\n\n36:41.600 --> 36:47.280\n but try to detect the light. Because now, of course, these exoplanets are detected by their\n\n36:47.280 --> 36:52.720\n effects on the parent star. They either cause their parent star to dim slightly when they\n\n36:52.720 --> 36:58.880\n transit across in front of it, and so we see the dips, or their gravitational pull makes the star\n\n36:58.880 --> 37:05.440\n wobble a bit. So most of the 5,000 plus planets that have been found around other stars, they've\n\n37:05.440 --> 37:09.440\n been found indirectly by their effect in one of those two ways on the parent star.\n\n37:09.440 --> 37:13.600\n TG. You can still do a pretty good job estimating size, all those kinds of things.\n\n37:13.600 --> 37:22.160\n MR. The size and the mass, you can estimate. But detecting the actual light from one of these\n\n37:22.160 --> 37:27.600\n exoplanets hasn't really been done yet, except for one or two very bright, big planets.\n\n37:27.600 --> 37:29.360\n TG. So maybe like James Webb Telescope.\n\n37:29.360 --> 37:35.120\n MR. Well, James Webb may do this, but even better will be the European ground based telescope\n\n37:36.000 --> 37:42.480\n called Unimaginatively Extremely Large Telescope, which has a 39 meter diameter mirror. 39 meters,\n\n37:42.480 --> 37:49.920\n a mosaic of eight hundred sheets of glass, and that will collect enough light from one of these\n\n37:49.920 --> 37:57.760\n exoplanets around a nearby star to be able to separate out its light from that of the star,\n\n37:57.760 --> 38:03.280\n which is millions of times brighter, and get the spectrum of the planet and see if it's got\n\n38:03.280 --> 38:11.600\n oxygen or chlorophyll and things in it. So that will come. James Webb may make some steps there.\n\n38:11.600 --> 38:18.240\n But I think we can look forward to learning quite a bit in the next 20 years, because I like to say,\n\n38:18.240 --> 38:24.320\n supposing that aliens were looking at the solar system. Then they'd see the sun as an ordinary\n\n38:24.320 --> 38:31.120\n star. They'd see the Earth as, in Carl Sagan's nice phrase, a pale blue dot lying very close in\n\n38:31.120 --> 38:38.400\n the sky to its star, our sun, and much, much, much fainter. But if they could observe that dot,\n\n38:38.960 --> 38:44.320\n they could learn quite a bit. They could perhaps get the spectrum of the light and find the\n\n38:44.320 --> 38:49.120\n atmosphere. They'd find the shade of blue was slightly different, depending on whether the\n\n38:49.120 --> 38:54.720\n Pacific Ocean or the land mass of Asia was facing them, so they could infer the length of the day\n\n38:54.720 --> 38:59.200\n and the ocean and continents, and maybe something about the seasons and the climate.\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:08.160\n That's the kind of calculation and inference we might be able to draw within the next 10 or 20\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:16.560\n years about other exoplanets. Evidence of some sort of biosphere on one of them would, of course,\n\n39:16.560 --> 39:22.080\n be crucial, and it would rule out the still logical possibility that life is unique.\n\n39:22.080 --> 39:26.080\n But there's another way in which this may happen in the next 20 years. People think there could be\n\n39:26.080 --> 39:33.600\n something swimming under the ice of Europa and Enceladus, and probes are being sent to maybe not\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:39.360\n quite go under the ice but detect the spray coming out to see if there's evidence for organics in\n\n39:39.360 --> 39:47.360\n that. And if we found any evidence for an origin of life that had happened in either of those\n\n39:47.360 --> 39:54.640\n places, that would immediately be important. Because if life has originated twice independently\n\n39:54.640 --> 39:59.280\n in one planetary system, the solar system, that would tell us straight away it wasn't a rare\n\n39:59.280 --> 40:05.920\n accident and must have happened billions of times in the galaxy. At the moment, we can't rule out\n\n40:05.920 --> 40:11.600\n it being unique. And incidentally, if we found life on Mars, then that would still be ambiguous\n\n40:11.600 --> 40:18.080\n because people have realized that this early life could have got from Mars to Earth or vice versa\n\n40:18.080 --> 40:24.480\n on meteorites. So if you found life on Mars, then some skeptics could still say if it's a single\n\n40:24.480 --> 40:31.360\n origin. But I think that's far enough away statistically. So that's why that would be\n\n40:31.360 --> 40:38.560\n especially... It's always the skeptics that ruin a good party. But we need them, of course. We need\n\n40:38.560 --> 40:44.800\n them at the party. We need some skeptics at the party. But boy, would that be so exciting to find\n\n40:44.800 --> 40:52.160\n life on one of the moons. Because it means that life is everywhere. That'll just be any kind of\n\n40:52.160 --> 40:58.160\n vegetation or life. The question of the aliens of science fiction is a different matter.\n\n40:58.160 --> 41:05.200\n LW. Intelligent aliens. Yeah, but if you have a good indication that there's life elsewhere in\n\n41:05.200 --> 41:15.040\n the solar system, that means life is everywhere. I don't know if that's terrifying or what that is.\n\n41:15.040 --> 41:22.000\n Because if life is everywhere, why is intelligent life not everywhere? You've talked about that\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:29.040\n most likely alien civilizations, if they are out there, they would likely be far ahead of us.\n\n41:29.760 --> 41:38.800\n The ones that would actually communicate with us. And that, again, one of those things is both\n\n41:38.800 --> 41:44.080\n exciting and terrifying. You've mentioned that they're likely not to be of biological nature.\n\n41:44.080 --> 41:51.840\n MR. Well, I think that's important. Of course, again, it's speculation. But in speculating about\n\n41:51.840 --> 41:59.200\n intelligent life, and I take the search seriously. In fact, I chair the committee that the Russian\n\n41:59.200 --> 42:05.280\n American investor Yuri Milner supports looking for intelligent life. He's putting $10 million\n\n42:05.840 --> 42:11.120\n a year into better equipment and getting time on telescopes to do this. And so I think it's\n\n42:11.120 --> 42:17.440\n worthwhile, even though I don't hold my breath for success. It's very exciting. But that does\n\n42:18.000 --> 42:24.480\n lead me to wonder what might be detected. And I think, well, we don't know. We've got to be\n\n42:24.480 --> 42:28.800\n open minded about anything. We have no idea what it could be. And so any anomalous objects,\n\n42:28.800 --> 42:34.000\n or even some strange shiny objects in the solar system, or anything we've got to keep our eyes\n\n42:34.000 --> 42:44.240\n open for. But I think if we ask about a planet like the Earth, where evolution had taken more\n\n42:44.240 --> 42:51.120\n of the same track, then, as you say, it wouldn't be synchronized. If it had lagged behind, then,\n\n42:51.120 --> 42:57.840\n of course, it would not have got to advanced life. But it may have had a head start. It may\n\n42:57.840 --> 43:04.960\n have formed on a planet around an older star. But then let's ask what we would see. It's taken\n\n43:04.960 --> 43:10.800\n nearly four billion years from the first life to us. And we now got this technological civilization\n\n43:11.600 --> 43:21.840\n which could make itself detectable to any aliens out there. But I think most people would say\n\n43:21.840 --> 43:29.280\n that this civilization of flesh and blood creatures in a collective civilization may not last more\n\n43:29.280 --> 43:38.960\n than a few hundred years more. I think that some people would say it will kill itself off. But I'm\n\n43:38.960 --> 43:47.200\n more optimistic. And I would say that what we're going to have in future is no longer the slow\n\n43:47.200 --> 43:53.920\n Darwinian selection. But we're going to have what I call secular intelligent design, which will be\n\n43:54.640 --> 44:01.680\n humans designing their progeny to be better adapted to where they are.\n\n44:02.640 --> 44:09.280\n And if they go to Mars or somewhere, they're badly adapted and they want to adapt a lot.\n\n44:09.280 --> 44:15.760\n And so they will adapt. But there may be some limits to what could be done with flesh and blood.\n\n44:15.760 --> 44:23.840\n And so they may become largely electronic, download their brains and be electronic entities.\n\n44:23.840 --> 44:29.120\n And if they're electronic, then what's important is that they're near immortal.\n\n44:30.640 --> 44:36.240\n And also, they won't necessarily want to be on a planet with an atmosphere or gravity. They may\n\n44:36.240 --> 44:41.200\n go off into the blue yonder. And if they're near immortal, they won't be daunted by interstellar\n\n44:41.200 --> 44:51.200\n travel taking a long time. And so if we looked at what would happen on the Earth in the next\n\n44:51.200 --> 44:58.320\n millions of years, then there may be these electronic entities, which have been sent out\n\n44:58.320 --> 45:04.640\n and are now far away from the Earth, but still sort of burping away in some fashion to be detected.\n\n45:04.640 --> 45:13.920\n And so this therefore leads me to think that if there was another planet which had evolved like\n\n45:13.920 --> 45:19.680\n the Earth and was ahead of us, it wouldn't be synchronized, so we wouldn't see a flesh and\n\n45:19.680 --> 45:26.240\n blood civilization, but we would see these electronic progeny, as it were. And then this\n\n45:26.240 --> 45:33.600\n raises another question, because there's the famous argument against there being lots of\n\n45:33.600 --> 45:38.720\n aliens out there, which is that they would come and invade us and eat us or something like that.\n\n45:39.600 --> 45:45.280\n That's a common idea, which Fermi is attributed to have been the first to say.\n\n45:46.160 --> 45:53.200\n And I think there's an escape clause to that, because these entities would be\n\n45:54.800 --> 45:59.920\n evolved by second intelligent design, designed by their predecessors and then designed by us.\n\n45:59.920 --> 46:11.120\n Whereas Darwinian selection requires two things. It requires aggression and intelligence. This\n\n46:11.120 --> 46:16.960\n future intelligent design may favor intelligence, because that's what they were designed for,\n\n46:16.960 --> 46:23.760\n but it may not favor aggression. And so these future entities, they may be sitting deep thoughts,\n\n46:23.760 --> 46:30.880\n they're thinking deep thoughts, and not being at all expansionist. So they could be out there.\n\n46:32.240 --> 46:38.000\n And we can't refute their existence in the way the Fermi paradox is supposed to refute their\n\n46:38.000 --> 46:41.520\n existence, because these would not be aggressive or expansionist.\n\n46:41.520 --> 46:46.880\n Well, maybe evolution requires competition, not aggression. And I wonder if competition\n\n46:46.880 --> 46:53.040\n can take forms that are non expansionary. So you can still have fun competing in the space\n\n46:53.040 --> 46:56.240\n of ideas, which maybe primarily...\n\n46:56.240 --> 46:57.760\n The Darwin philosophers, perhaps, yeah.\n\n46:59.440 --> 47:07.040\n In a way, right. It's an intellectual exercise versus a sort of violent exercise.\n\n47:07.840 --> 47:14.640\n So what does this civilization on Mars look like? So do you think we would more and more\n\n47:15.280 --> 47:20.560\n maybe start with some genetic modification and then move to basically cyborgs,\n\n47:20.560 --> 47:25.920\n increasing integration of electronic systems, computational systems into our bodies and brains?\n\n47:25.920 --> 47:31.920\n This is a theme of my other new book out this year, which is called The End of Astronauts.\n\n47:31.920 --> 47:33.040\n The End of Astronauts.\n\n47:33.040 --> 47:40.320\n It's co written with my old friend and colleague from Berkeley, Don Goldsmith. And it's really\n\n47:40.320 --> 47:48.400\n about the role of human spaceflight versus sort of robotic spaceflight. And just to summarize\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:56.400\n what it says, it argues that the practical case for sending humans into space is getting\n\n47:56.400 --> 48:02.960\n weaker all the time as robots get better and more capable. Robots 50 years ago couldn't\n\n48:02.960 --> 48:08.560\n do anything very much, but now they could assemble big structures on space or in space\n\n48:08.560 --> 48:17.360\n or on the moon, and they could probably do exploration. But present ones on Mars can't\n\n48:17.360 --> 48:24.080\n actually do the geology, but future AI will be able to do the geology and already they\n\n48:24.080 --> 48:31.360\n can dig on Mars. And so if you want to do exploration of Mars, and of course, even more\n\n48:31.360 --> 48:37.840\n of Enceladus or Europa where you could never send humans, we depend on robots. And they're\n\n48:37.840 --> 48:43.760\n far, far cheaper because to send a human to Mars requires feeding them for 200 days on\n\n48:43.760 --> 48:48.000\n the journey there and bringing them back. And neither of those are necessary for robots.\n\n48:48.000 --> 48:54.000\n So the practical case for humans is getting very, very weak. And if humans go, it's only\n\n48:54.000 --> 49:03.360\n as an adventure, really. And so the line in our book is that human spaceflight should\n\n49:03.360 --> 49:12.800\n not be pursued by NASA or public funding agencies because it has no practical purpose, but also\n\n49:12.800 --> 49:18.560\n because it's especially expensive if they do it because they would have to be risk averse\n\n49:19.440 --> 49:25.840\n in launching civilians into space. I can illustrate that by noting that the shuttle\n\n49:27.200 --> 49:35.040\n was launched 135 times and it had two spectacular failures, which each killed the seven people in\n\n49:35.040 --> 49:42.800\n the crew. And it had been mistakenly presented as safe for civilians. And there was a woman\n\n49:42.800 --> 49:46.800\n schoolteacher killed in one of them. It was a big national trauma and they tried to make\n\n49:46.800 --> 49:54.800\n it safer still. But if you launch into space, just the kind of people prepared to accept that\n\n49:54.800 --> 50:00.400\n sort of risk, and of course, test pilots and people who go hang gliding and go to the South\n\n50:00.400 --> 50:06.800\n Pole, et cetera, are prepared to accept a 2% risk at least for a big challenge, then of course,\n\n50:06.800 --> 50:14.560\n you do it more cheaply. And that's why I think human spaceflight should be left to the billionaires\n\n50:16.240 --> 50:22.960\n and their sponsors because then the taxpayers aren't paying and they can launch simply those\n\n50:22.960 --> 50:31.440\n people who are prepared to accept high risks. Space adventure, not space tourism. And we should\n\n50:31.440 --> 50:40.480\n cheer them on. And as regards where they would go, then low Earth orbit, as I suspect, can be done\n\n50:40.480 --> 50:46.640\n quite cheaply in the future. But going to Mars, which is very, very expensive and dangerous for\n\n50:46.640 --> 50:55.360\n humans. The only people who would go would be these adventurers, maybe on one way trip,\n\n50:55.360 --> 51:00.160\n like some of the early polar explorers and Magellan and people like that. And we would\n\n51:00.160 --> 51:07.920\n cheer them on. And I expect and I've ever hoped that by the end of a century, there will be a\n\n51:07.920 --> 51:16.000\n small community of such people on Mars living very uncomfortably, far less comfortably than\n\n51:16.000 --> 51:20.000\n at the South Pole or the bottom of the ocean or the top of Everest. But they will be there\n\n51:21.520 --> 51:29.040\n and they won't have a return ticket, but they'll be there. Incidentally, I think it's a dangerous\n\n51:29.040 --> 51:38.640\n illusion to think, as Elon Musk has said, that we can have mass emigration from the Earth to Mars\n\n51:38.640 --> 51:44.960\n to escape the Earth's problems. It's a dangerous illusion because it's far easier to deal with\n\n51:44.960 --> 51:51.520\n climate change on Earth than to terraform Mars to make it probably habitable to humans.\n\n51:51.520 --> 51:56.240\n And so there's no planet B for ordinary risk averse people. But for these crazy adventurers,\n\n51:56.240 --> 52:03.040\n then you can imagine that they would be trying to live on Mars as great pioneers.\n\n52:03.040 --> 52:09.040\n And by the end of a century, then there will be huge advances compared to the present in two\n\n52:09.040 --> 52:16.320\n things. First, in understanding genetics, so as to genetically redesign one's offspring. And\n\n52:16.320 --> 52:23.600\n secondly, to use cyborg techniques to implant something in our brain or indeed think about\n\n52:23.600 --> 52:30.080\n downloading, et cetera. And those techniques will, one hopes, be heavily regulated on Earth on\n\n52:30.080 --> 52:36.000\n prudentials and ethical grounds. And of course, we are pretty well adapted to the Earth, so we\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:41.680\n don't have the incentive to do these things in the way they were there. So our argument is that\n\n52:42.560 --> 52:51.040\n it'll be those crazy pioneers on Mars using all these scientific advances, which will be\n\n52:51.040 --> 52:57.760\n controlled here, away from the regulators, they will transition into a new post human species.\n\n52:58.720 --> 53:04.800\n And so if they do that, and if they transition into something which is electronic,\n\n53:04.800 --> 53:09.600\n eventually, because there may be some limits to the capacity of flesh and blood brains anyways,\n\n53:10.240 --> 53:16.400\n then those electronic entities may not want to stay on a planet like Mars, they may want to go\n\n53:16.400 --> 53:24.400\n away. And so they'll be the precursors of the future evolution of life and intelligence coming\n\n53:24.400 --> 53:29.840\n from the Earth. And of course, there's one point which perhaps astronomers are more aware of than\n\n53:29.840 --> 53:35.840\n most people. Most people are aware that we are the outcome of 4 billion years of evolution.\n\n53:36.800 --> 53:42.160\n Most of them nonetheless, probably think that we humans are somehow the culmination,\n\n53:42.960 --> 53:49.120\n the top of the tree. But yes, no astronomers can believe that because astronomers know\n\n53:49.760 --> 53:56.240\n that the Earth is four and a half billion years old. The sun has been shiny for that length of\n\n53:56.240 --> 54:01.760\n time. But the sun has got 6 billion years more to go before it flares up and engulfs the inner\n\n54:01.760 --> 54:08.160\n planet. So the sun is less than halfway through its life. And the expanding universe goes on far\n\n54:08.160 --> 54:13.040\n longer still, maybe forever. And I like to quote Woody Allen, who said, eternity is very long,\n\n54:13.040 --> 54:19.840\n especially towards the end. So we shouldn't think of ourselves as maybe even the halfway stage\n\n54:19.840 --> 54:27.920\n in the emergence of cosmic complexity. And so these entities who are postcursors,\n\n54:27.920 --> 54:32.960\n they will go beyond the solar system. And of course, even if there's nothing else out there\n\n54:32.960 --> 54:40.800\n already, then they could populate the rest of the galaxy. And maybe eventually meet the others who\n\n54:40.800 --> 54:48.480\n are out there expanding as well. Expanding, populating with expanded capacity for life\n\n54:48.480 --> 54:55.440\n and intelligence, all those kinds of things. Well, they might. But again, all better off.\n\n54:55.440 --> 55:03.600\n We can't conceive what they'd be like. They won't be green men and women with eyes on stalks.\n\n55:03.600 --> 55:08.560\n Maybe something quite different. We just don't know. But there is an interesting question,\n\n55:08.560 --> 55:12.480\n actually, which comes up when I've sometimes spoken to audiences about this topic,\n\n55:12.480 --> 55:17.680\n but the question of consciousness and self awareness. Because going back to philosophical\n\n55:17.680 --> 55:26.720\n questions, whether an electronic robot would be a zombie, or would it be conscious and self aware?\n\n55:27.280 --> 55:34.400\n And I think there's no way of answering this empirically. And some people think that\n\n55:34.400 --> 55:39.680\n consciousness and self awareness is an emergent property in any sufficiently complicated networks\n\n55:39.680 --> 55:44.720\n that they would be. Others say, well, maybe it's something special to the flesh and blood that we're\n\n55:44.720 --> 55:51.600\n made of. We don't know. And in a sense, this may not matter to the way things behave because\n\n55:52.720 --> 55:57.920\n they could be zombies and still behave as though they were intelligent. But I remember\n\n55:59.040 --> 56:06.960\n after one of my talks, someone came up and said, wouldn't it be sad if these future entities,\n\n56:06.960 --> 56:11.680\n which were the main intelligent in the universe, had no self awareness? So there was nothing\n\n56:11.680 --> 56:17.440\n which could appreciate the wonder and mystery of the universe and the beauty of the universe\n\n56:17.440 --> 56:24.880\n in the way that we do. And so it does perhaps affect one's perspective of whether you welcome\n\n56:24.880 --> 56:30.800\n or deplore this possible future scenario, depending on whether you think the future\n\n56:30.800 --> 56:36.800\n post human entities are conscious and have an aesthetic sense or whether they're just zombies.\n\n56:36.800 --> 56:44.640\n And of course, you have to be humble to realize that self awareness may not be the\n\n56:45.360 --> 56:53.920\n highest form of being, that humans have a very strong ego and a very strong sense of identity,\n\n56:54.480 --> 57:00.240\n like personal identity connected to this particular brain. It's not so obvious to me\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:08.800\n that that is somehow the highest achievement of a life form, that maybe this kind of...\n\n57:08.800 --> 57:10.720\n Do you think something collective would be?\n\n57:10.720 --> 57:16.160\n It's possible that, well, I think from an alien perspective, when you look at Earth,\n\n57:17.200 --> 57:24.080\n it's not so obvious to me that individual humans are the atoms of intelligence. It could be the\n\n57:24.080 --> 57:28.320\n entire organism together, the collective intelligence. And so we humans think of\n\n57:28.320 --> 57:33.280\n ourselves as individuals, we dress up, we wear ties and suits, and we'll give each other prizes.\n\n57:33.280 --> 57:39.920\n But in reality, the intelligence, the things we create that are beautiful emerges from our\n\n57:39.920 --> 57:44.960\n interaction with each other. And that may be where the intelligence is, ideas jumping from\n\n57:44.960 --> 57:47.360\n one person to another over generations.\n\n57:47.360 --> 57:54.800\n Yes, but we have experiences where we can appreciate beauty and wonder and all that.\n\n57:54.800 --> 57:58.400\n And a zombie may not have those experiences.\n\n57:59.840 --> 58:04.080\n Yeah, or it may have a very different, a very black and white,\n\n58:04.080 --> 58:10.080\n harsh description of a philosophical zombie that could be just a very different way to experience.\n\n58:13.920 --> 58:18.800\n And, you know, in terms of the explorers that colonize Mars,\n\n58:18.800 --> 58:25.200\n I mean, there's several things I want to mention. One, it's just at a high level. To me,\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:31.120\n that's one of the most inspiring things humans can do, is reach out into the unknown. That's\n\n58:31.120 --> 58:34.640\n in the space of ideas, in the space of science, but also the explorers.\n\n58:34.640 --> 58:35.920\n Yes, no, I agree with that.\n\n58:35.920 --> 58:42.400\n And that inspires people here on Earth more. I mean, it did in their, you know,\n\n58:42.400 --> 58:46.320\n when going to the moon or going out to space in the 20th century, that inspired me.\n\n58:46.320 --> 58:54.160\n I think that also could be used to inspire a generation of new scientists in the 21st century\n\n58:54.160 --> 59:00.160\n by reaching out towards Mars. So in that sense, I think what Elon Musk and others are doing is\n\n59:00.160 --> 59:07.200\n actually quite inspiring. It's not, it's not a recreational thing. It's actually has a deep\n\n59:07.200 --> 59:12.880\n humanitarian purpose of really inspiring the world. And then, you know, I think, you know,\n\n59:12.880 --> 59:22.240\n I don't think Elon says we want to escape Earth's problems. It's more that we should allocate some\n\n59:22.240 --> 59:30.880\n small percentage of resources to have a backup plan. And because you yourself have spoken about\n\n59:30.880 --> 59:35.680\n and written about all the ways we clever humans destroy ourselves.\n\n59:35.680 --> 59:36.320\n You could go on.\n\n59:36.320 --> 59:45.680\n And I'm not sure, it does seem when you look at the long arc of human history, it seems almost\n\n59:45.680 --> 59:51.840\n obvious that we need to become a multi planetary species over a period. If we are to survive many\n\n59:51.840 --> 59:59.440\n centuries, it seems that as we get clever and clever with the ways we can destroy ourselves,\n\n59:59.440 --> 1:00:08.560\n Earth is going to become less and less safe. So in that sense, this is one of the things,\n\n1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:13.040\n you know, people talk about climate change and that we need to respond to climate change. And\n\n1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:19.120\n that's a long term investment we need to make, but it's not really long term. It's a span of decades.\n\n1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:22.800\n I think what Elon is doing is a really long term investment.\n\n1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:29.280\n We should be working on multi planetary colonization now if we were to have it ready\n\n1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:35.440\n five centuries from now. And so taking those early steps. And then also there's something\n\n1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:42.480\n happens when you go into the unknown and do this really difficult thing. You discover\n\n1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:47.520\n something very new. You discover something about robotics. You discover something about\n\n1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:53.680\n materials engineering or nutrition or neuroscience or human relations or political systems that\n\n1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:59.600\n actually work well with humans. You discover all those things. And so it's a worthy effort to go\n\n1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:08.000\n out there and try to become cyborgs. Yeah, no, I agree with that. I think the only different point\n\n1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:17.360\n I'd make is that this is going to be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,\n\n1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:23.920\n very expensive if it's done in a risk averse way. And that's why I think we should be grateful to\n\n1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:32.640\n the billionaires if they're going to sort of foster these opportunities for thrill seeking\n\n1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:38.160\n risk takers who we can all admire. Yeah. By the way, I should push back on the billionaires\n\n1:01:38.160 --> 1:01:41.760\n because there's sometimes a negative connotation to the word billionaire. It's not a billionaire.\n\n1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:46.640\n It's a company versus government because governments are billionaires and trillionaires.\n\n1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:55.360\n Yeah. It's not the wealth. It's the capitalist imperative, which I think\n\n1:01:58.320 --> 1:02:04.240\n deserves a lot more praise than people are giving it. I'm troubled by the sort of criticism like\n\n1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:11.760\n it's billionaires playing with toys for their own pleasure. I think what some of these companies\n\n1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:19.840\n like SpaceX and Blue Origin are doing is some of the most inspiring engineering and even scientific\n\n1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:26.480\n work ever done in human history. No, I agree. I think the people who've made the greatest wealth\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:30.080\n are people who've really been mega benefactors. I mean, I think, you know.\n\n1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:37.040\n Some of them, some of them. Yeah, yes, some of them. But those who've founded Google and all\n\n1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:44.560\n that and even Amazon, they're beneficiaries. They're in a quite different category, in my view,\n\n1:02:44.560 --> 1:02:52.080\n from those who just shuffle around money or crypto coins and things like that.\n\n1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:54.880\n Now you're really talking trash.\n\n1:02:54.880 --> 1:03:02.800\n Yes. But I think if they use their money in these ways, that's fine. But I think it's true that far\n\n1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:08.160\n more money is owned by us collectively as taxpayers. But I think the fact is that in a democracy,\n\n1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:16.640\n there'd be big resistance to exposing human beings to very high risks if in a sense we\n\n1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:21.920\n share responsibility for it. And that's the reason I think it would be done much more cheaply by\n\n1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:24.560\n these private funders.\n\n1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:29.600\n That's an interesting hypothesis, but I have to push back. I don't know if it's obvious\n\n1:03:29.600 --> 1:03:38.240\n why NASA spends so much money and takes such a long time to develop the things it was doing.\n\n1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:44.160\n So before Elon Musk came along, because I would love to live in a world where government\n\n1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:49.200\n actually uses taxpayer money to get some of the best engineers and scientists in the world\n\n1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:55.040\n and actually work across governments, Russia, China, United States, European Union together\n\n1:03:55.040 --> 1:04:00.960\n to do some of these big projects. It's strange that Elon is able to do this much cheaper,\n\n1:04:00.960 --> 1:04:06.160\n much faster. It could have to do with risk aversion, you're right.\n\n1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:15.600\n But I think it's that he had all the whole assembly within this one building as it were,\n\n1:04:15.600 --> 1:04:22.000\n rather than depending on a supply chain. But I think it's also that he had a Silicon Valley\n\n1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.920\n culture and had younger people, whereas the big aerospace companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin,\n\n1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:33.840\n they had people who were left over from the Apollo program in some cases. And so they weren't\n\n1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:40.000\n quite so lively. And indeed, quite apart from the controversial issues of the future of human\n\n1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:48.000\n spaceflight, in terms of the next generation of big rockets, then the one that Musk is going to\n\n1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:55.200\n launch for the first time this year, the huge one, is going to be far, far cheaper than the\n\n1:04:55.200 --> 1:05:01.680\n one that NASA has been working on at the same time. And that's because it will have a reusable\n\n1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:09.680\n first stage. And it's going to be great. It can launch over 100 tons into Earth orbit. And\n\n1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:14.320\n incidentally, that's going to make it feasible to do things that I used to think were crazy,\n\n1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:20.480\n like having solar energy from space. That's no longer so crazy if you can do that. And also,\n\n1:05:21.200 --> 1:05:31.520\n for science, because its nose cone could contain within it something as big as the entire unfurled\n\n1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:37.440\n James Webb telescope mirror. And therefore, you can have a big telescope much more cheaply if you\n\n1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:43.440\n can launch it all in one piece. And so it's going to be hugely beneficial to science and to any\n\n1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:49.280\n practical use of space to have these cheaper rockets that are far more completely reusable\n\n1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:56.320\n than anyways NASA had. So I think Musk's done a tremendous service to space exploration and the\n\n1:05:56.320 --> 1:06:03.120\n whole space technology through these rockets, certainly. Plus, it's some big sexy rocket.\n\n1:06:03.120 --> 1:06:07.600\n It's just great engineering. Of course, yeah. It's like looking at a beautiful big bridge\n\n1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:12.880\n that humans are capable. Us descendants of apes are capable to do something so majestic.\n\n1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:16.800\n Yes. And also the way they land coming down on this bar. That's amazing.\n\n1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:23.680\n It's both controls engineering. It's increasing sort of intelligence in these rockets, but also\n\n1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:31.440\n great propulsion engineering materials, entrepreneurship. And it just inspires so\n\n1:06:31.440 --> 1:06:38.400\n many people. No, I'm entirely with you on that. So would it be exciting to you to see a human\n\n1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:43.280\n being step foot on Mars in your lifetime? Yes, I think it's unlikely in my lifetime\n\n1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:50.080\n since I'm so ancient. But I think this century, it's going to happen. And I think that will\n\n1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:55.040\n indeed be exciting. And I hope there will be a small community by the end of a century.\n\n1:06:55.040 --> 1:07:03.600\n But as I say, I think they may go with one way tickets or accepting the risk of no return.\n\n1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:10.240\n And so they've got to be people like that. And I still think it's going to be hard to persuade\n\n1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:18.160\n the public to send people when you say straight out that they may never come back. But of course,\n\n1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:25.040\n the Apollo astronauts, they took a high risk. And in fact, in my previous book, I quote the\n\n1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:31.200\n speech that has been written for Nixon to be read out if Neil Armstrong got stuck on the moon.\n\n1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:42.480\n And it was written by one of his advisors and very eloquent speech about how they have come\n\n1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:51.600\n to a noble end, et cetera. But of course, there was a genuine risk at that time. But that may have\n\n1:07:51.600 --> 1:07:59.200\n been accepted. But clearly, the crashes of the shuttle were not acceptable to the American\n\n1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:05.280\n public, even when they were told that this was only a 2% risk given how often they launched it.\n\n1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:13.760\n And so that's what leads me to think that it's got to be left to the kind of people who are\n\n1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:19.520\n prepared to take these risks. And I think of American Avengers, there was a guy called Steve\n\n1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:25.600\n Fossett who was an aviator who did all kinds of crazy things. And then a guy who fell\n\n1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:32.640\n supersonically with a parachute from very high altitude. All these people, we all share them on.\n\n1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:39.360\n They extend the bounds of humanity. But I don't think the public will be so happy to fund them.\n\n1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:44.640\n I mean, I disagree with that. I think if we change the narrative, we should change the story.\n\n1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:45.200\n You think so?\n\n1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:53.760\n I think there's a lot of people... Because the public is happy to fund folks in other domains\n\n1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:57.600\n that take bold, giant risks. First of all, military, for example.\n\n1:08:57.600 --> 1:08:59.600\n Oh, in the military, obviously, yes.\n\n1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:05.200\n I think this is, in the name of science, especially if it's sold correctly, I sure as hell would go\n\n1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:12.480\n up there with a risk... I would take a 40% chance risk of death for something that's...\n\n1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:17.600\n I would. I might want to be even older than I am now. But then I would go.\n\n1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:22.400\n I guess what I'm trying to communicate is there's a lot of people on Earth. That's the nice feature\n\n1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:27.360\n and I'm sure there's going to be a significant percentage or some percentage of people that are...\n\n1:09:27.360 --> 1:09:36.240\n They take on the risk for the adventure. So, and I particularly love that that risk of adventure\n\n1:09:36.240 --> 1:09:40.960\n when taking on inspires people and just the ripple effect it has across the generation,\n\n1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:50.880\n especially among the young minds, is perhaps immeasurable. But you're thinking that sending\n\n1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:56.880\n humans should be something we do less and less, sending humans to space. That it should be\n\n1:09:56.880 --> 1:10:03.680\n primarily an effort. The work of space exploration should be done primarily by robots.\n\n1:10:03.680 --> 1:10:09.600\n Well, I think it can be done much more cheaply, obviously, on Mars. And no one's thinking of\n\n1:10:09.600 --> 1:10:18.000\n sending humans to Enceladus or Europa, the outer planets. And the point is we will have much better\n\n1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:27.920\n robots. Because let's take an example. You've seen the pictures of the moons of Saturn and the\n\n1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:37.520\n picture of Pluto and the comet taken by probes and Cassini spent 13 years going around Saturn and\n\n1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:43.040\n its moons after seven year voyage. And those are all based on 1990s technology. And if you think\n\n1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:47.600\n of how smartphones have advanced in the 20 years since then, just think how much better one could\n\n1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:54.160\n do instrumenting some very small, sophisticated probe. You could send dozens of them to explore\n\n1:10:54.160 --> 1:10:58.960\n the outer planets. And that's the way to do that. Because no one thinks you could send humans that\n\n1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:07.040\n far. But I would apply the same argument to Mars. And if you want to assemble big structures like,\n\n1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:12.240\n for instance, radio astronomers would like to have a big radio telescope on the far side of the moon\n\n1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:19.920\n so it's away from the Earth's background artificial radio waves. And that could be\n\n1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:28.240\n done by assembling using robots without people. So on the moon and on Mars, I think\n\n1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:34.320\n everything that's useful can be done by machines much more cheaper than by humans.\n\n1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:39.120\n Do you know the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey?\n\n1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.840\n Of course, yes. You must be too young to have seen that when it came out, obviously.\n\n1:11:44.720 --> 1:11:45.920\n I remember seeing it when it came out.\n\n1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:48.000\n You saw it when it came out.\n\n1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:50.640\n Yeah, yeah, 50 years ago.\n\n1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:54.960\n 60, when was it? 60, in the 60s.\n\n1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:57.120\n Yeah, that's right. Still a classic.\n\n1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:03.280\n It's still probably, for me, the greatest AI movie ever made.\n\n1:12:03.280 --> 1:12:04.720\n Yes, yes, I agree.\n\n1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.720\n One of the great space movies ever made.\n\n1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:12.240\n Yes. Well, let me ask you a philosophical question. Since we're talking about robots\n\n1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:19.680\n exploring space, do you think HAL 9000 is good or bad? So for people who haven't watched,\n\n1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:28.720\n this computer system makes a decision to basically prioritize the mission that\n\n1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:37.360\n the ship is on over the humans that are part of the mission. Do you think HAL is good or evil?\n\n1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:43.040\n If you ask me, probably in that context, it was probably good. But I think you're raising\n\n1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:50.640\n what is, of course, very much an active issue in everyday life about the extent to which we should\n\n1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:57.760\n entrust any important decision to a machine. And there again, I'm very worried, because I think\n\n1:12:58.560 --> 1:13:06.960\n if you are recommended for an operation or not given parole from prison or even denied credit\n\n1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:13.920\n by your bank, you feel you should be entitled to an explanation. It's not enough to be told that\n\n1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:20.720\n the machine has a more reliable record on the whole than humans have of making these decisions.\n\n1:13:20.720 --> 1:13:26.560\n You think you should be given reasons you could understand. And that's why I think the present\n\n1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:37.360\n societal trend to take away the humans and leave us in the hands of decisions that we can't contest\n\n1:13:37.360 --> 1:13:44.480\n is a very dangerous one. I think we've got to be very careful of the extent to which AI,\n\n1:13:44.480 --> 1:13:48.880\n which can handle lots of information, actually makes the decision without oversight. And I think\n\n1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:57.840\n we can use them as a supplement. But to take the case of radiology and cancer,\n\n1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:08.160\n I mean, it's true that the radiologist hasn't seen as many x rays of cancer lungs as the machine. So\n\n1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:12.400\n the machine could certainly help, but you want the human to make the final decision. And I think\n\n1:14:12.400 --> 1:14:18.800\n that's true in most of these instances. But if we turn a bit to the short term concerns with\n\n1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:27.120\n robotics, I think the big worry, of course, is the effect it has on people's self respect and\n\n1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:35.200\n their labor market. And I think my solution would be that we should arrange to tax more heavily\n\n1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:46.000\n the big international conglomerates, which use the robots and use that tax to fund\n\n1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:54.000\n decently paid, dignified posts of the kind where being a human being is important.\n\n1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:59.520\n Above all, carers for old people, teachers assistants for young, gardens in public parks,\n\n1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:05.920\n and things like that. And if the people who are now working in mind numbing jobs in Amazon\n\n1:15:05.920 --> 1:15:15.120\n warehouses, or in telephone call centers, are automated, but those same people are given\n\n1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:22.320\n jobs where being a human is an asset, then that's a plus plus situation. And so that's\n\n1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:30.480\n the way I think that we should benefit from these technologies, take over the mind numbing jobs,\n\n1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:40.800\n and use machines to make them more efficient, but enable the people so displaced to do jobs\n\n1:15:40.800 --> 1:15:46.720\n where we do want a human being. I mean, most people when they're old, they're rich people\n\n1:15:46.720 --> 1:15:51.440\n if they have the choice. They want human carers and all that, don't they? They may want robots\n\n1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:57.680\n to help with some things, empty the bed pans and things like that, but they want real people. And\n\n1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:06.400\n certainly in this country, I think even worse in America, the care of old people is completely\n\n1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:11.360\n inadequate. And it needs just more human beings to help them cope with everyday life and look after\n\n1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:19.360\n them when they're sick. And so that seems to be the way in which the money raised in tax from\n\n1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:24.240\n these big companies should be deployed. So that's in the short term, but if you actually just look,\n\n1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:30.480\n the fact is where we are today to longterm future in a hundred years, it does seem that\n\n1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:37.840\n there is some significant chance that the human species is coming to an end in its\n\n1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:43.680\n pure biological form. There's going to be greater and greater integration\n\n1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:50.800\n through genetic modification and cyborg type of creatures. And so you have to think, all right,\n\n1:16:50.800 --> 1:16:56.080\n well, we're going to have to get from here to there and that process is going to be painful.\n\n1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:01.680\n And there's so many different trajectories that take us from one place to another.\n\n1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:09.840\n It does seem that we need to deeply respect humanness and humanity, basic human rights,\n\n1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:14.880\n human welfare, like happiness and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:20.240\n No, absolutely. And that's why I think we ought to try and slow down the application of these\n\n1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:25.360\n human enhancement techniques and cyborg techniques for humans for just that reason. I mean,\n\n1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:32.320\n that's why I want to lead into the people on Mars, let them do it, but for just that reason.\n\n1:17:32.320 --> 1:17:37.360\n But there are people too. Okay. People on Mars are people too. I tend to, you know.\n\n1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:42.800\n But they are very poorly adapted to where they are. That's why they need this modification,\n\n1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:49.200\n whereas we're adapted to the Earth quite well. So we don't need these modifications. We're\n\n1:17:49.200 --> 1:17:54.800\n happy to be humans living in the environment where our ancestors lived. So we don't have the same\n\n1:17:55.520 --> 1:18:00.480\n motive. So I think there's a difference. But I agree, we don't want drastic changes probably in\n\n1:18:01.040 --> 1:18:06.480\n our lifestyle. And that indeed is a worry because some things are changing so fast.\n\n1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:13.760\n But I think I'd like to inject a note of caution. If you think of the way progress in one technology\n\n1:18:13.760 --> 1:18:21.040\n goes, it goes in a sort of spurt. It goes up very fast and then it levels off. Let me give you\n\n1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:28.400\n two examples. One we've had already, a human space flight. At the time of the Apollo program,\n\n1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:35.920\n which was only 12 years after Sputnik 1, I was alive then. And I thought it would only be 10\n\n1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:41.600\n or 20 years further before there were footprints on Mars. But as we know, for reasons we could all\n\n1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:50.560\n understand, that still remains the high point of human space exploration. That's because it was\n\n1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:57.600\n funded for reasons of superpower rivalry at huge public expense. But let me give you another case,\n\n1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:05.200\n civil aviation. If you think of the change between 1919, when that was Alcock and Brown's first\n\n1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:12.400\n transatlantic fight, to 1979, the first flight of the jumbo jet. It was a big change. But it's more\n\n1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:17.280\n than 50 years since 1969. And we still have jumbo jets more or less the same. So that's an example\n\n1:19:17.280 --> 1:19:24.880\n of something which developed fast. And to take another analogy, we've had huge developments in\n\n1:19:24.880 --> 1:19:30.880\n mobile phones. But I suspect the iPhone 24 may not be too different from the iPhone 13.\n\n1:19:32.880 --> 1:19:39.680\n They develop, but then they saturate, and then maybe some new innovation takes over\n\n1:19:39.680 --> 1:19:47.120\n in stimulating economic growth. Yeah, so it's that we have to be cautious about being too optimistic,\n\n1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:52.160\n and we have to be cautious about being too cynical. I think that is the\n\n1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:56.240\n optimistic is begging the question. I mean, do we want this rapid change?\n\n1:19:56.240 --> 1:20:01.760\n Right. So first of all, there's some degree to which technological advancement is something,\n\n1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:07.120\n is a force that can't be stopped. And so the question is about directing it versus stopping it\n\n1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:11.680\n or slowing it. Well, it can be sort of sloped or slow. We'll take human spaceflight. There could\n\n1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:19.040\n have been footprints on Mars if America had gone on spending 4% of the federal budget on the project\n\n1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:29.600\n after Apollo. There were very good reasons, and we could have had supersonic flight, but Concorde\n\n1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:37.440\n came and went during the 50 years. But the reason it didn't progress is not because we realize it's\n\n1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:41.760\n not good for human society. The reason it didn't progress is because it couldn't make,\n\n1:20:41.760 --> 1:20:47.760\n sort of from a capitalist perspective, it couldn't make, there was no short term or long term way for\n\n1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:52.560\n it to make money. So for me, it isn't, but that's the same as saying it's not good for society.\n\n1:20:54.080 --> 1:20:59.760\n I don't think everything that makes money is good for society and everything that doesn't make money\n\n1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:06.640\n is bad for society, right? That's a difficult thing we're always contending with.\n\n1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:14.800\n That's a difficult thing we're always contending with when we look at social networks. It's not\n\n1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:19.040\n obvious, even though they make a tremendous amount of money, that they're good for society,\n\n1:21:19.040 --> 1:21:23.520\n especially how they're currently implemented with advertisement and engagement maximization.\n\n1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:26.240\n So that's the constant struggle.\n\n1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:38.720\n But I would have thought that supersonic flight was something that would benefit only a tiny\n\n1:21:38.720 --> 1:21:44.480\n elite at a huge expense and environmental damage. That was obviously something which we're very\n\n1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:45.840\n glad not to have, in my opinion.\n\n1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:51.840\n Yeah, but perhaps there was a way to do it where it could benefit the general populace.\n\n1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:56.880\n If you were to think about airplanes, wouldn't you think that in the early days, airplanes would\n\n1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:03.600\n have been seen as something that can surely only benefit 1% at most of the population,\n\n1:22:03.600 --> 1:22:09.520\n as opposed to a much larger percentage? There's another aspect of capitalist system that's able\n\n1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:15.760\n to drive down costs once you get the thing kind of going. So we get together maybe with taxpayer\n\n1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:21.200\n money and get the thing going at first. And once it gets going, companies step up and drive down\n\n1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:26.400\n the cost and actually make it so that blue collar folks can actually start using the stuff.\n\n1:22:26.400 --> 1:22:28.320\n Yeah, sometimes that does happen. That's good.\n\n1:22:29.360 --> 1:22:37.280\n Yeah. So that's, again, the double edged sword of human civilization, that some technology\n\n1:22:37.280 --> 1:22:41.840\n hurts us, some benefits us, and we don't know ahead of time. We can just do our best.\n\n1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:47.760\n Yes. There's a gap between what could be done and what we collectively decide to do.\n\n1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:49.440\n Yes.\n\n1:22:49.440 --> 1:22:55.120\n And it could push forward some developments faster than we do.\n\n1:22:55.120 --> 1:22:59.840\n Let me ask you, in your book on the future prospects for humanity,\n\n1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:05.440\n you imagine a time machine that allows you to send a tweet length message to scientists in\n\n1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:12.160\n the past, like to Newton. What tweet would you send? It's an interesting thought experiment.\n\n1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:15.680\n What message would you send to Newton about what we know today?\n\n1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:22.000\n Well, I think he'd love to know that there were planets around other stars. He'd like to know\n\n1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:29.440\n that everything was made of atoms. He'd like to know that if he looked a bit more carefully\n\n1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:38.400\n through his prisms and looked at light, not just from the sun, but from some flames,\n\n1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:44.320\n he might get the idea that different substances emitted light of different colors, and he might\n\n1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:51.920\n have been twigged to discover some things that had to wait 200 or 300 years. Could have given him\n\n1:23:51.920 --> 1:23:57.760\n those clues, I think. It's fascinating to think, to look back at how little\n\n1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:03.120\n he understood, people at that time understood about our world.\n\n1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:07.280\n Yes. And certainly about the cosmos.\n\n1:24:07.280 --> 1:24:08.880\n About the cosmos, yes.\n\n1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:17.440\n Well, if you think about astronomy, then until about 1850, astronomy was a matter of\n\n1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:25.440\n the positions of how the stars and the planets moved around. Of course, that goes back a long\n\n1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:31.760\n way, but Newton understood why the planets moved around in ellipses. But he didn't understand\n\n1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:39.760\n why the solar system was all in a plane, what we call the ecliptic, and he didn't understand it.\n\n1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:44.400\n No one did until the mid 19th century what the stars are made of. I mean, they were thought to\n\n1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:48.160\n be made of some fifth essence, not earth, air, fire, and water like everything else,\n\n1:24:49.040 --> 1:24:56.640\n and it was only after 1850 when people did use prisms more precisely to get spectra that they\n\n1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:04.960\n realized that the sun was made of the same stuff as the earth, and indeed the stars were. It wasn't\n\n1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:12.480\n until 1930 that people knew about nuclear energy and knew what kept the sun shining for so long.\n\n1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:17.600\n So it was quite late that some of these key ideas came in, which would have completely\n\n1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:25.360\n transformed Newton's views, and of course, the entire scale of the galaxy and the rest of the\n\n1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:30.320\n universe. Just imagine what he would have thought about the Big Bang, or even just general\n\n1:25:30.320 --> 1:25:39.200\n relativity, just gravity, just him and Einstein talking for a couple weeks. Would he be able to\n\n1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:46.240\n make sense of space time and the curvature of space time? Well, I think given a quick course,\n\n1:25:46.240 --> 1:25:51.680\n I mean, he was sort of, if one looks back, he was really a unique intellect in a way,\n\n1:25:51.680 --> 1:26:00.640\n you know, and he said that he thought better than everyone else by thinking on things continually,\n\n1:26:00.640 --> 1:26:06.400\n and thinking very deep thoughts, and so he was an utterly remarkable intellect, obviously.\n\n1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.320\n But of course, scientists aren't all like that. I think one thing that's interesting to me,\n\n1:26:10.320 --> 1:26:16.560\n having spent a life among scientists, is what a variety of mindsets and mental styles they have.\n\n1:26:16.560 --> 1:26:30.560\n And just to contrast Newton and Darwin, Darwin said, and he's probably correct, that he thought\n\n1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:38.720\n he just had as much common sense and reasoning power as the average lawyer. And that's probably\n\n1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:45.200\n true because his ability was to sort of collect data and think through things deeply. That's a\n\n1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.560\n quite different kind of thinking from what was involved in Newton or someone doing abstract\n\n1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:57.840\n mathematics. I think in the 20th century, the coolest, well, there's the theory, but\n\n1:26:59.200 --> 1:27:08.320\n from an astronomy perspective, black holes is one of the most fascinating entities to have been,\n\n1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:13.680\n through theory and through experiment, to have emerged from. Obviously, I agree. It's an amazing\n\n1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:22.080\n story. Well, of course, what's interesting is Einstein's reaction because, as you know,\n\n1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:27.520\n we now accept this is one of the most remarkable predictions of Einstein's theory. He never took\n\n1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:34.480\n it seriously, even believed it, although it was a consequence of a solution of his equations,\n\n1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:40.640\n which someone discovered just a year after his theory, Schwarzschild. But he never took it\n\n1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:47.600\n seriously, and others did. But then, of course, well, this is something that I've been involved\n\n1:27:47.600 --> 1:27:53.040\n in actually finding evidence for black holes, and that's come in the last 50 years. So now,\n\n1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:58.800\n there's pretty compelling evidence that they exist as the remnants of stars or big ones in\n\n1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:07.120\n the center of galaxies. And we understand what's going on. We have ideas, vaguely on how they form.\n\n1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:14.160\n And, of course, gravitational waves have been detected, and that's an amazing piece of technology.\n\n1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.240\n Ligo is one of the most incredible engineering efforts of all time.\n\n1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:23.120\n That's an example where the engineers deserve most of the credit because the precision is,\n\n1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:28.960\n as I said, it's like measuring the thickness of a hair at the distance of Alpha Centauri.\n\n1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.320\n Yeah, it's incredible.\n\n1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:31.440\n Tens to minus 21.\n\n1:28:31.440 --> 1:28:36.240\n So maybe, actually, if we step back, what are black holes? What do we humans understand about\n\n1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:39.600\n black holes and what's still unknown?\n\n1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:47.120\n Einstein's theory, extended by people like Roger Penrose, tells us that black holes are,\n\n1:28:47.120 --> 1:28:54.080\n in a sense, rather simple things, basically, because they are solutions of Einstein's equations.\n\n1:28:54.880 --> 1:29:01.280\n And the thing that was shown in the 1960s by Roger Penrose in particular, and by a few other\n\n1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:09.040\n people, was that a black hole, when it forms and settles down, is defined just by two quantities,\n\n1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:14.640\n its mass and its spin. So they're actually very standardized objects. It's amazing that objects\n\n1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:20.560\n as standardized as that can be so big and can lurk in the rest of the solar system.\n\n1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:27.120\n And so that's the situation for a ready formed black hole. But the way they form, obviously,\n\n1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:36.080\n is very messy and complicated. And one of the things that I've worked on a lot is what the\n\n1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:41.600\n phenomena are, which are best attributed to black holes, and what may lead to them, and all that.\n\n1:29:43.040 --> 1:29:46.320\n Which, can you explain to that? So what are the different phenomena\n\n1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:49.920\n that lead to a black hole? Let's talk about it. This is so cool.\n\n1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:56.880\n Oh, okay. Well, I think one thing that only became understood, really,\n\n1:29:56.880 --> 1:30:05.280\n in the 1950s, I suppose, and beyond was how stars evolve differently depending on how\n\n1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:11.360\n heavy they are. The sun burns hydrogen to helium, and then when it's run out of that,\n\n1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:16.160\n it contracts to be a white dwarf. And we know how long that will take. It'll take about 10 billion\n\n1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:23.600\n years altogether for its lifetime. But big stars burn up their fuel more quickly, and more\n\n1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:27.680\n interestingly, because when they've turned hydrogen to helium, they then get even hotter,\n\n1:30:27.680 --> 1:30:33.440\n so they can fuse helium into carbon and go up the periodic table. And then they eventually\n\n1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:38.400\n explode when they have an energy crisis, and they blow out that process material,\n\n1:30:38.400 --> 1:30:43.920\n which, as a digression, is crucially important because all the atoms inside our bodies\n\n1:30:44.880 --> 1:30:50.640\n were synthesized inside a star, a star that lived and died more than five billion years ago\n\n1:30:50.640 --> 1:30:55.920\n before our solar system formed. And so we each have inside us atoms made in thousands of different\n\n1:30:55.920 --> 1:31:00.800\n stars all over the Milky Way, and that's an amazing idea. My predecessor, Fred Hoyle,\n\n1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:05.600\n in 1946 was the first person to suggest that idea, and that's been borne out. That's a wonderful\n\n1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:15.200\n idea. So that's how massive stars explode. And they leave behind something which is very exotic\n\n1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:21.760\n of two kinds. One possibility is a neutron star, and these were first discovered in 1967,\n\n1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:29.040\n 68. These are stars a bit heavier than the sun, which are compressed to an amazing density,\n\n1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:34.720\n so the whole mass of more than the sun's mass is in something about 10 miles across.\n\n1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:46.880\n So they're extraordinarily dense, they're exotic physics, and they've been studied in immense\n\n1:31:46.880 --> 1:31:51.360\n detail. And they've been real laboratories because the good thing about astronomy, apart from\n\n1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:57.040\n exploring what's out there, is to use the fact that the cosmos has provided us with a lab\n\n1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.040\n with far more extreme conditions than we could ever simulate. And so we learn lots of basic\n\n1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:05.760\n physics from looking at these objects, and that's been true of neutron stars. But for black holes,\n\n1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:14.160\n that's even more true because the bigger stars, when they collapse, they leave something behind\n\n1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:19.040\n in the center which is too big to be a stable white 2 or 4 neutron star and becomes a black hole.\n\n1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:25.520\n And we know that there are lots of black holes weighing about 10 or up to 50 times as much as the\n\n1:32:25.520 --> 1:32:33.840\n sun, which are the remnants of stars. They were detected first 50 years ago, when a black hole\n\n1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:40.240\n was orbiting around another star and grabbing material from the other star which swirled into\n\n1:32:40.240 --> 1:32:48.960\n it and gave us X rays. So the X rays astronomers found these objects orbiting around an ordinary\n\n1:32:48.960 --> 1:32:56.240\n star and emitting X ray radiation very intensely, varying on a very short time scale. So something\n\n1:32:56.240 --> 1:33:00.800\n very small and dense was giving that radiation. That was the first evidence for black holes.\n\n1:33:00.800 --> 1:33:05.680\n But then the other thing that happened was realizing that there was a different class\n\n1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:12.480\n of monster black holes in the centers of galaxies. And these are responsible for what's called\n\n1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:19.680\n quasars, which is when something in the center of a galaxy is grabbing some fuel and outshines all\n\n1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:26.640\n the hundred billion stars or so in the rest of the galaxy. A giant beam of light. And in many\n\n1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:34.080\n cases, it's a beam of... That's got to be the most epic thing the universe produces is quasars.\n\n1:33:35.200 --> 1:33:40.560\n Well, it's a debate about what's the most epic, but quasars maybe or maybe gamma ray bursts or\n\n1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:45.840\n something, but they are remarkable and they were a mystery for a long time. And they're\n\n1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:50.160\n one of the things I worked on in my younger days. So even though they're so bright,\n\n1:33:50.160 --> 1:33:54.960\n they're still a mystery and you can only see them. I think they're less of a mystery now.\n\n1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:59.680\n I think we do understand basically what's going on. How were quasars discovered?\n\n1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:05.760\n Well, they were discovered when astronomers found things that looked like stars and that they were\n\n1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:12.880\n small enough to be a point like and not resolved by a telescope, but outshone an entire galaxy.\n\n1:34:13.440 --> 1:34:15.840\n Yeah. That's suspicious.\n\n1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:25.280\n Yes. But then they realized that what they were, they were objects which you now know are black\n\n1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:33.840\n holes and black holes were capturing gas and that gas was getting very hot, but it was producing\n\n1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:43.280\n far more energy than all the stars added together. And it was the energy of the black hole that was\n\n1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:50.000\n lighting up all the gas in the galaxy. So you've got a spectrum of it there. So this was something\n\n1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:56.160\n which was realized from the 1970s onwards. And as you say, the other thing we've learned is that\n\n1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:03.840\n they often do produce these jets squirting out, which could be detected in all wave bands. So\n\n1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:05.040\n there's now a standard picture.\n\n1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:10.480\n So there's a giant black hole generating jets of light at the center of most galaxies.\n\n1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:11.200\n Yes. That's right.\n\n1:35:11.200 --> 1:35:18.480\n Do we know, do we have a sense if every galaxy has one of these big boys, big black holes?\n\n1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:23.840\n Most galaxies have big black holes. They vary in size. The one in our galactic center.\n\n1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:25.120\n Do we know much about ours?\n\n1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:34.560\n We do. Yes. We know it weighs about as much as 4 million suns, which is less than some,\n\n1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:40.560\n it's several billion other galaxies. But we know this one in our galactic center\n\n1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:46.000\n isn't very bright or conspicuous. And that's because not much is falling into it at the\n\n1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:52.560\n moment. If a black hole is isolated, then of course it doesn't radiate. All that radiates\n\n1:35:52.560 --> 1:35:57.440\n is gas swirling into it, which is very hot or has magnetic fields.\n\n1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:01.840\n It's only radiating the thing it's murdering or consuming, however you put it.\n\n1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:07.440\n Yeah, that's right. And so it's thought that our galaxy may have been bright at some time\n\n1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:16.320\n in the past, but now that's when the black hole formed or grew. But now it's not capturing\n\n1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:24.320\n very much gas. And so it's rather faint and detected indirectly and by fairly weak radio\n\n1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:31.520\n emission. And so I think the answer to your question is that we suspect that most galaxies\n\n1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:36.960\n have a black hole in them. So that means at some stage in their lives, or maybe one or\n\n1:36:36.960 --> 1:36:41.680\n more stages, they went through a phase of being like a quasar where that black hole\n\n1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:47.680\n captured gas and became very, very bright. But for the rest of their lives, the black\n\n1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.240\n holes are fairly quiescent because there's not much gas falling into them.\n\n1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:58.640\n And so this universe of ours is sprinkled with a bunch of galaxies and giant black holes with\n\n1:37:01.840 --> 1:37:08.400\n very large number of stars orbiting these black holes and then planets orbiting.\n\n1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:17.680\n Likely, it seems like planets orbiting almost every one of those stars and just this beautiful\n\n1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:23.280\n universe of ours. Well, what happens when galaxies collide, when these two big black holes\n\n1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:32.800\n collide? Well, what would happen is that... Well, and I should say that this is going to happen\n\n1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:37.840\n near us one day, but not for 4 billion years because the Andromeda galaxy, which is the\n\n1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:44.640\n biggest galaxy near to us, which is about nearly 3 million light years away, which is a big disk\n\n1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:53.120\n galaxy with a black hole in its hub, rather like our Milky Way. And that's falling towards us\n\n1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:59.200\n because they're both in a common gravitational potential well. And that will collide with our\n\n1:37:59.200 --> 1:38:05.440\n galaxy in about 4 billion years. But maybe it'll be less a collision and more of a dance because\n\n1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:10.960\n it'll be like a swirling situation. But eventually, there'll be a merger. They'll\n\n1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:16.080\n go through each other and then merge. In fact, there are nice movies to be made of this,\n\n1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:26.000\n computer simulations, and it'll go through. And then there's a black hole in the center of\n\n1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:34.640\n Andromeda and our galaxy. And the black holes will settle towards the center. Then they will\n\n1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:39.840\n orbit around each other very fast, and then they will eventually merge. And that'll produce a big\n\n1:38:39.840 --> 1:38:45.760\n burst of gravitational waves, a very big burst. That an alien civilization with a LIGO like\n\n1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:50.240\n detector will be able to detect. Yes. Well, in fact, we can detect these\n\n1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:57.440\n with their lower frequencies than the ways that will be detected by LIGO. So there's a\n\n1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:04.480\n spatial interferometer which can detect these. It's about one cycle per hour rather than about\n\n1:39:04.480 --> 1:39:11.680\n 100 cycles per second. It's the ones that detect it. But that will happen. But thinking back to\n\n1:39:11.680 --> 1:39:19.600\n what will happen in 4 billion years to any of our descendants, they'll be okay because the two disk\n\n1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:26.320\n galaxies will merge. It'll end up as a sort of amorphous elliptical galaxy. But the stars won't\n\n1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:32.800\n be much closer together than they are now. It'll still be just twice as many stars in a structure\n\n1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:40.080\n almost as big. And so the chance of another star colliding with our sun would still be very small.\n\n1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.120\n Because there's actually a lot of space between stars and planets.\n\n1:39:45.120 --> 1:39:49.200\n Yes, the chance of a star getting close enough to affect our solar system's orbit\n\n1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:53.440\n is small. And it won't change that very much. So you could be reassured.\n\n1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:57.680\n A heck of a starry sky though. What would that look like?\n\n1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:00.000\n Well, it won't make much difference even to that actually. It'll just be...\n\n1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:05.600\n Wouldn't that look kind of beautiful when you're swirling? Oh, because it's swirling so slowly.\n\n1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:10.320\n Yeah, but they're far away. So it'll be twice as many stars in the sky.\n\n1:40:10.320 --> 1:40:12.880\n Yeah, but the pattern changes in interesting ways.\n\n1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:17.200\n Yeah, the pattern will change a bit. And there won't be the Milky Way because the Milky Way\n\n1:40:17.200 --> 1:40:22.400\n across the sky is because we are looking in the disk of our galaxy. And you lose that.\n\n1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:28.800\n And because the disk will be so disrupted. And it'll be a more sort of spherical distribution.\n\n1:40:28.800 --> 1:40:33.680\n And of course, many galaxies are like that. And that's probably because they have been through\n\n1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:36.720\n mergers of this kind. If we survive four billion years,\n\n1:40:36.720 --> 1:40:39.520\n we would likely be able to survive beyond that. Oh, yeah.\n\n1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:45.440\n What's the other thing on the horizon for humans in terms of the sun burning out,\n\n1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:51.360\n all those kinds of interesting cosmological threats to our civilization?\n\n1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:57.920\n Well, I think on the cosmological time scale, because it won't be humans, because even if\n\n1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:03.120\n evolution is no faster than Darwinian, and I would argue it will be faster than Darwinian\n\n1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:09.760\n in the future, then we're thinking about six billion years before the sun dies. So any\n\n1:41:09.760 --> 1:41:14.320\n entities watching the death of the sun, if they're still around, they'll be as different\n\n1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:20.640\n from much as we are from slime mold or something. And far more different still if they become\n\n1:41:20.640 --> 1:41:25.600\n electronic. So on that time scale, we just can't predict anything. But I think going back to\n\n1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:32.880\n the human time scale, then we've talked about whether there'll be people on Mars by the end\n\n1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:39.760\n of a century. And even in these long perspectives, then indeed, this century is very special,\n\n1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:45.760\n because it may see the transition between purely flesh and blood entities to those which are sort\n\n1:41:45.760 --> 1:41:51.040\n of cyborgs. And that'll be an important transition in the future.\n\n1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:55.760\n But of course, the other importance, and this has been the theme of a couple of my older books,\n\n1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:02.400\n is that this is the first century when one species, namely our species, has the future of\n\n1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:10.800\n the planet in its hands. And that's because of two types of concerns. One is that there are more\n\n1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:16.720\n of us where more of us are living in the past, and the other is that there are more of us who are\n\n1:42:16.720 --> 1:42:23.840\n living in the future. So those are two concerns. One is that there are more of us where more\n\n1:42:23.840 --> 1:42:30.640\n demanding of energy and resources, and therefore we are for the first time changing the whole\n\n1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:37.360\n planet through climate change, loss of biodiversity, and all those issues. This has never\n\n1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:43.760\n happened in the past, because there haven't been enough humans. So this is an effect that's\n\n1:42:43.760 --> 1:42:51.040\n now, and rightly so, because we've got to ensure that we leave a heritage that isn't eroded or\n\n1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:55.760\n damaged to future generations. And so that's one class of threats.\n\n1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:02.800\n But there's another thing that worries me, perhaps more than many people seem to worry,\n\n1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:11.520\n and that's the threat of misuse of technology. And so this is particularly because technologies\n\n1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:21.920\n empower even small groups of malevolent people, or indeed even careless people, to create some\n\n1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:30.400\n effect which could cascade globally. And to take an example, a dangerous pathogen or pandemic,\n\n1:43:30.400 --> 1:43:42.160\n I mean, my worst nightmare is that there could be some small group that can engineer a virus\n\n1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:47.600\n to make it more variant or more transmissible than a natural virus. This is a gain of function\n\n1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:51.840\n experiments which were done on the flu virus 10 years ago and can be done for others.\n\n1:43:51.840 --> 1:44:02.720\n And of course, we now know from COVID 19 that our world is so interconnected that a disaster in one\n\n1:44:02.720 --> 1:44:07.680\n part of the world can't be confined to that part and will spread globally. So it's possible for\n\n1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:14.320\n a few dissidents with expertise in biotech could create a global catastrophe of that kind.\n\n1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:21.600\n And also, I think we need to worry about very large scale disruption by cyber attacks and\n\n1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:31.680\n in fact, I quote in one of my books, a 2012 report from the American Pentagon about the possibility\n\n1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:38.720\n of a state level cyber attack on the electricity grid in Eastern United States, which is it could\n\n1:44:38.720 --> 1:44:45.680\n happen. And it says at the end of this chapter that this would merit a nuclear response. This\n\n1:44:45.680 --> 1:44:51.600\n is a pretty scary possibility. And that was 10 years ago. And I think now what would have needed\n\n1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:57.520\n a state actor then could be done perhaps by a small group empowered by AI. And so there's\n\n1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:06.080\n obviously been an arms race between the cyber criminals and the cyber security people. Not\n\n1:45:06.080 --> 1:45:11.600\n clear which side is winning. But the main point is that as we become more dependent on more\n\n1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:21.680\n integrated systems, then we get more vulnerable. And so we have the knowledge, then the misuse of\n\n1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:28.960\n that knowledge becomes more and more of a threat. And I'd say bio and cyber are the two biggest\n\n1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:37.680\n concerns. And if we depend too much on AI and complex systems, then just breakdowns, it may be\n\n1:45:37.680 --> 1:45:43.600\n that they break down. And even if it's an innocent breakdown, then it may be pretty hard to mend it.\n\n1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:48.720\n And just think how much worse the pandemic would have been if we'd lost the internet in the middle\n\n1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:55.440\n of it. We'd be dependent more than ever for communication and everything else on the internet\n\n1:45:55.440 --> 1:46:01.360\n and Zooms and all that. And if that had broken down, that would have made things far worse. And\n\n1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:07.520\n those are the kinds of threats that we, I think, need to be more energized and politicians need to\n\n1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:13.680\n be more energized to minimize. And one of the things I've been doing in the last year through\n\n1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:20.720\n being a member of our part of our parliament is I have to instigate a committee to think more on\n\n1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:26.400\n better preparedness for extreme technological risks and things like that. So they're a big\n\n1:46:26.400 --> 1:46:36.800\n concern in my mind that we've got to make sure that we can benefit from these advances but safely\n\n1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:42.720\n because the stakes are getting higher and the benefits are getting great, as we know, huge\n\n1:46:42.720 --> 1:46:50.400\n benefits from computers, but also huge downsides as well. And one of the things this war in Ukraine\n\n1:46:50.400 --> 1:46:58.080\n has shown, one of the most terrifying things outside of the humanitarian crisis, is that at\n\n1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:10.400\n least for me, I realized that the human capacity to initiate nuclear war is greater than I thought.\n\n1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:17.120\n I thought the lessons of the past have been learned. It seems that we hang on the brink of\n\n1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:28.560\n nuclear war with this conflict like every single day with just one mistake or bad actor or the\n\n1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:35.760\n actual leaders of the particular nations launching a nuclear strike and all hell breaks loose. So\n\n1:47:35.760 --> 1:47:43.200\n then add into that picture, cyber attacks and so on, that can lead to confusion and chaos. And then\n\n1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:56.000\n out of that confusion, calculations are made such that a nuclear weapon is launched and then\n\n1:47:56.000 --> 1:48:05.520\n you're talking about, I mean, it directs probably 60, 70% of humans on Earth are dead instantly.\n\n1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:14.320\n And then the rest, I mean, it's basically 99% of the human population is wiped out in the period\n\n1:48:14.320 --> 1:48:18.640\n of five years. Well, it may not be that bad, but it will be a devastation for civilization,\n\n1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:24.000\n of course. And of course, you were quite right that this could happen very quickly because of\n\n1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:34.560\n information coming in and there's hardly enough time for human collected and careful thought.\n\n1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:41.520\n And there have been recorded cases of false alarms. There's several where there have been\n\n1:48:41.520 --> 1:48:48.080\n suspected attacks from the other side. And fortunately, they've been really false alarm\n\n1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:53.440\n soon enough, but this could happen. And there's a new class of threats actually, which in our\n\n1:48:53.440 --> 1:49:00.400\n center in Cambridge, people are thinking about, which is that the commander control system\n\n1:49:00.400 --> 1:49:08.880\n of the nuclear weapons and the submarine fleet and all that is now more automated and could be\n\n1:49:08.880 --> 1:49:16.320\n subject to cyber attacks. And that's a new threat which didn't exist 30 years ago. And so I think\n\n1:49:16.800 --> 1:49:26.800\n indeed, we're in a sort of scary world, I think. And it's because things happen faster and human\n\n1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:32.960\n beings aren't in such direct and immediate control because so much is delegated to machines. And\n\n1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:40.720\n also because the world is so much more interconnected, then some local event can cascade\n\n1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:44.800\n globally in a way it never could in the past and much faster.\n\n1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:54.000\n Yeah, it's a double edged sword because the interconnectedness brings a higher quality of\n\n1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.800\n life across a lot of metrics.\n\n1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:02.000\n Yeah, it can do. But of course, there again, I mean, if you think of supply chains where we\n\n1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:06.960\n get stuff from around the world, then one lesson we've learned is that there's a trade off between\n\n1:50:06.960 --> 1:50:16.240\n resilience and efficiency and it's resilient to have an inventory in stock and to depend on local\n\n1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:24.160\n supplies, whereas they're more efficient to have long supply chains. But the risk there is that a\n\n1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:30.080\n break in one link in one chain can screw up car production. This has already happened in the\n\n1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:35.120\n pandemic. So there's a trade off. And there are other examples. I mean, for instance, the other\n\n1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:42.000\n thing we learned was that it may be efficient to have 95% of your hospital intensive care beds\n\n1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:47.120\n occupied all the time, which has been the UK situation, whereas to do what the Germans do and\n\n1:50:47.120 --> 1:50:53.200\n always keep 20% of them free for an emergency is really a sensible precaution. And so I think\n\n1:50:53.200 --> 1:51:01.200\n we've probably learned a lot of lessons from COVID 19. And they would include rebalancing the\n\n1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:04.800\n trade off between resilience and efficiency.\n\n1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:12.000\n Boy, the fact that COVID 19, a pandemic that could have been a lot, a lot worse,\n\n1:51:12.800 --> 1:51:14.560\n brought the world to its knees anyway.\n\n1:51:15.360 --> 1:51:20.800\n It could be far worse in terms of its fatality rate or something like that, of course.\n\n1:51:20.800 --> 1:51:26.000\n So the fact that that, I mean, it revealed so many flaws in our human institutions.\n\n1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:38.800\n And I think I'm rather pessimistic because I do worry about the baractol, a small group\n\n1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:46.720\n who can produce catastrophe. And if you imagine someone with access to the kind of equipment that's\n\n1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:52.880\n available in university labs or industrial labs, and they could create some dangerous pathogen,\n\n1:51:52.880 --> 1:52:00.880\n then even one such person is too many. And how can we stop that? Because it's true that you can\n\n1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:07.040\n have regulations. I mean, academies are having meetings, et cetera, about how to regulate these\n\n1:52:07.040 --> 1:52:12.560\n new biological experiments, et cetera, make them safe. But even if you have all these regulations,\n\n1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:20.560\n then enforcing regulations is pretty hopeless. We can't enforce the tax laws globally. We can't\n\n1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:28.720\n enforce the drug laws globally. And so similarly, we can't readily enforce the laws against people\n\n1:52:28.720 --> 1:52:33.680\n doing these dangerous experiments, even if all the governments say they should be prohibited.\n\n1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:40.480\n And so my line on this is that all nations are going to face a big trade off between\n\n1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:50.720\n three things we value, freedom, security, and privacy. And I think different nations will\n\n1:52:52.080 --> 1:52:59.920\n make that choice differently. The Chinese would give up privacy and have certainly more security,\n\n1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:08.800\n if not more liberty. But I think in our countries, I think we're going to have to give up more\n\n1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:15.840\n privacy in the same way. That's a really interesting trade off. But there's also something\n\n1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:21.600\n about human nature here, where I personally believe that all humans are capable of good and\n\n1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:32.160\n evil. And there's some aspect to which we can fight this by encouraging people, incentivizing people\n\n1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:38.960\n towards the better angels of their nature. So in order for a small group of people to create,\n\n1:53:38.960 --> 1:53:47.600\n to engineer deadly pathogens, you have to have people that, for whatever trajectory took them\n\n1:53:47.600 --> 1:53:55.840\n in life, wanting to do that kind of thing. And if we can aggressively work on a world\n\n1:53:55.840 --> 1:54:03.360\n that sort of sees the beauty in everybody and encourages the flourishing of everybody in terms\n\n1:54:03.360 --> 1:54:07.440\n of mental health, in terms of meaning, in terms of all those kinds of things, that's one way\n\n1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:14.320\n to fight the development of weapons that can lead to atrocities.\n\n1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:19.360\n RL Yes, and I completely agree with that and to reduce the reason why people feel embittered.\n\n1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:26.000\n But of course, we've got a long way to go to do that. Because if you look at the present world,\n\n1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:34.720\n nearly everyone in Africa has reason to feel embittered because their economic development\n\n1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:39.760\n is lagging behind most of the rest of the world. And the prospects of getting out of\n\n1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:46.000\n the poverty trap is rather bleak, especially as the population grows. Because for instance,\n\n1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:50.160\n they can't develop like the Eastern Tigers by cheap manufacturing, because robots have taken\n\n1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:59.120\n that over. So they naturally feel embittered by the inequality. And of course, what we need to have\n\n1:54:59.120 --> 1:55:05.600\n is some sort of mega version of the Marshall Plan that helped Europe in the post World War II era\n\n1:55:06.400 --> 1:55:11.840\n to enable Africa to develop. That would be not just an altruistic thing for Europe to do,\n\n1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:19.520\n but in our interest because otherwise, those in Africa will feel massively disaffected.\n\n1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:24.960\n And indeed, it's a manifestation of the excessive inequalities, the fact that the\n\n1:55:24.960 --> 1:55:29.920\n 2000 richest people in the world have enough money to double the income of the bottom billion.\n\n1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:39.040\n And that's an indictment of the ethics of the world. And this is where my friend Stephen Pinker\n\n1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:46.400\n and I have had some contact. We wrote joint articles on bio threats and all that. But he\n\n1:55:46.400 --> 1:55:54.560\n writes these books, being very optimistic about quoting figures about how life expectancy has gone\n\n1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:58.480\n up, infant mortality has gone down, literacy has gone up, and all those things. And he's quite\n\n1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:04.320\n right about that. And so he says the world's getting better. Do you disagree with your\n\n1:56:04.320 --> 1:56:11.680\n friends, Stephen Pinker? Well, I mean, I agree with those facts. But I think he misses out part\n\n1:56:11.680 --> 1:56:19.120\n of the picture. Because there's a new class of threats, which hang over us now, which didn't\n\n1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:24.880\n hang over us in the past. And I would also question whether we have collectively improved\n\n1:56:24.880 --> 1:56:30.640\n our ethics at all. Because let's think back to the Middle Ages. It's true that, as Pinker says,\n\n1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:37.680\n the average person was in a more miserable state than they are today, on average. For all the\n\n1:56:37.680 --> 1:56:44.720\n reasons he quantifies, that's fine. But in the Middle Ages, there wasn't very much that could\n\n1:56:44.720 --> 1:56:51.120\n have been done to improve people's lot in life because of lack of knowledge and lack of science,\n\n1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:57.200\n etc. So the gap between the way the world was, which was pretty miserable, and the way the world\n\n1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:03.520\n could have been, which wasn't all that much better, was fairly narrow. Whereas now, the gap\n\n1:57:03.520 --> 1:57:09.520\n between the way the world is and the way the world could be is far, far wider. And therefore, I think\n\n1:57:09.520 --> 1:57:18.720\n we are ethically more at fault in allowing this gap to get wider than it was in medieval times.\n\n1:57:18.720 --> 1:57:26.160\n And so I would very much question and dispute the idea that we are ethically in advance of\n\n1:57:26.160 --> 1:57:33.200\n our predecessors collectively. That's a lot of interesting hypotheses in there. It's a fascinating\n\n1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:39.040\n question of how much is the size of that gap between the way the world is and the way the world\n\n1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:44.640\n could be is a reflection of our ethics. Or maybe sometimes it's just a reflection of a very large\n\n1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:51.280\n number of people. Maybe it's a technical challenge too. It's not just... Well, of our political\n\n1:57:51.280 --> 1:57:58.960\n systems. And we're trying to figure this thing out. There's 20th century, tried this thing that\n\n1:57:58.960 --> 1:58:05.040\n sounded really good on paper of collective, the communism type of things. And it's like,\n\n1:58:05.600 --> 1:58:10.720\n turned out at least the way that was done there, that leads to atrocities and the suffering and\n\n1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:15.840\n the murder of tens of millions of people. Okay, so that didn't work. Let's try democracy.\n\n1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:20.880\n And that seems to have a lot of flaws, but it seems to be the best thing we got so far.\n\n1:58:20.880 --> 1:58:25.360\n So we're trying to figure this out as our technologies become more and more powerful,\n\n1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:30.160\n have the capacity to do a lot of good to the world, but also unfortunately have the capacity\n\n1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:35.200\n to destroy the entirety of the human civilization. And I think it's social media generally,\n\n1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:43.840\n which makes it harder to get a sort of moderate consensus because in the old days when people got\n\n1:58:43.840 --> 1:58:49.680\n their news filtered through responsible journalists in this country, the BBC and the\n\n1:58:49.680 --> 1:58:55.520\n main newspapers, et cetera, they would muffle the crazy extremes. Whereas now, of course,\n\n1:58:56.480 --> 1:59:00.800\n they're on the internet. And if you click on them, you get something still more extreme.\n\n1:59:00.800 --> 1:59:06.240\n And so I think we are seeing a sort of dangerous polarization, which I think is going to make all\n\n1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:09.920\n countries harder to govern. And that's something which I'm pessimistic about.\n\n1:59:09.920 --> 1:59:15.360\n RL So to push back, it is true that brilliant people like you highlighting the limitations\n\n1:59:15.360 --> 1:59:22.480\n of social media is making them realize the stakes and the failings of social media companies,\n\n1:59:22.480 --> 1:59:26.560\n but at the same time, they're revealing the division. It's not like they're creating it,\n\n1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:34.160\n they're revealing it in part. And so that puts a lot of, that puts the responsibility\n\n1:59:34.160 --> 1:59:38.480\n into the hands of social media and the opportunity in the hands of social media\n\n1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:45.120\n to alleviate some of that division. So it could in the long arc of human history result. So bringing\n\n1:59:45.120 --> 1:59:52.000\n some of those divisions and the anger and the hatred to the surface so that we can talk about\n\n1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:57.680\n it. And as opposed to disproportionately promoting it, actually just surfacing it so we can get over\n\n1:59:57.680 --> 2:00:02.560\n it. Well, you're assuming that the fat cats are more public spirited than the politicians.\n\n2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:03.680\n And I'm not sure about that.\n\n2:00:03.680 --> 2:00:10.800\n RL I think there's a lot of money to be made in being publicly spirited. I think there's a lot of\n\n2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:16.400\n money to be made in increasing the amount of love in the world, despite the sort of public perception\n\n2:00:17.040 --> 2:00:22.480\n that all the social media companies heads are interested in doing is making money.\n\n2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:30.240\n I think that may be true, but I just personally believe people being happy\n\n2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:39.040\n is a hell of a good business model. And so making as many people happy, helping them flourish in a\n\n2:00:39.040 --> 2:00:42.240\n long term way, that's a good way to make money.\n\n2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:47.120\n RL Well, I think on the other hand, guilt and shame are good motives to make you behave better\n\n2:00:47.120 --> 2:00:49.760\n in the future. That's my experience.\n\n2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:56.480\n RL From maybe in the political perspective, certainly it's the case. But it does make sense\n\n2:00:56.480 --> 2:01:02.480\n now that we can destroy ourselves with nuclear weapons, with engineered pandemics and so on,\n\n2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:14.560\n that the aliens would show up. If I had a leadership position, maybe as a scientist\n\n2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:22.320\n or otherwise in an alien civilization, and I would come upon Earth, I would try to watch from\n\n2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:31.680\n a distance, do not interfere. And I would start interfering when these life forms start\n\n2:01:31.680 --> 2:01:38.720\n becoming quite, have the capacity to be destructive. And so, I mean, it is an interesting\n\n2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:43.920\n question when people talk about UFO sightings and all those kinds of things that at least...\n\n2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:45.920\n RL These are benign aliens you're thinking of.\n\n2:01:45.920 --> 2:01:55.920\n RL Benign, yes. I mean, they benign, almost curious, almost, partially, as with all curiosity,\n\n2:01:55.920 --> 2:02:00.720\n partially selfish to try to observe, is there something interesting about this particular\n\n2:02:00.720 --> 2:02:06.560\n evolutionary system? Because I'm sure even to aliens, Earth is a curiosity.\n\n2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:09.760\n RL Yeah. Well, it's in its very special stage.\n\n2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:12.560\n RL It's very special. Perhaps it's very short.\n\n2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:17.200\n RL This century is very special among the 45 million centuries the Earth experienced already.\n\n2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:22.960\n So it is a very special time where they should be specially interested. But I think going back\n\n2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:31.600\n to the politics, the other problem is getting people who have short term concerns to care\n\n2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:38.320\n about the long term. By the long term, I now mean just looking 30 years or so ahead. I\n\n2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:43.680\n know people who've been scientific advisors to governments and things, and they may make\n\n2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:48.080\n these points, but of course, they don't have much traction because as we know very well,\n\n2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:54.080\n any politician has an urgent agenda of very worrying things to deal with. And so they\n\n2:02:54.080 --> 2:03:01.280\n aren't going to prioritize these issues, which are longer term and less immediate, and don't\n\n2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:07.040\n just concern their constituents, they concern distant parts of the world. And so I think\n\n2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:17.200\n what we have to do is to enlist charismatic individuals to convert the public, because\n\n2:03:17.200 --> 2:03:25.120\n if the politicians know the public care about something, climate change as an example, then\n\n2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:34.400\n they will make decisions which take cognizance of that. And I think for that to happen, then\n\n2:03:34.400 --> 2:03:42.000\n we do need some public individuals who are respected by everyone, and to have a high\n\n2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:48.800\n profile. And in the climate context, I would say that I've mentioned four very disparate\n\n2:03:48.800 --> 2:03:54.080\n people who've had such a big effect in the last few years. One is Pope Francis, the other is\n\n2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:58.800\n David Attenborough, the other is Bill Gates, and the other is Greta Thornberg. And those\n\n2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:07.040\n four people have certainly had a big shift in public opinion, and even changed the rhetoric\n\n2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:14.960\n of business, although how deep that is, I don't know. But politicians can't let these\n\n2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:21.600\n issues drop down off the agenda if there's a public clamor, and it needs people like that\n\n2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:23.040\n to keep the public clamor going.\n\n2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:27.440\n To push back a little bit, so those four are very interesting, and I have deep respect\n\n2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:33.520\n for them. They have, except David Attenborough, David Attenborough is really, I mean, everybody\n\n2:04:33.520 --> 2:04:40.480\n loves him. I can't say anything. But Bill Gates and Greta, that also has created a lot\n\n2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:46.800\n of division. And this is a big problem, so it's not just charismatic. I put that responsibility\n\n2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:57.280\n actually on the scientific community and the politicians. So we need the charismatic leaders,\n\n2:04:58.080 --> 2:05:03.200\n and they're rare. When you look at human history, those are the ones that make a difference.\n\n2:05:03.200 --> 2:05:13.520\n Those are the ones that, not deride, they inspire the populace to think long term. The\n\n2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:19.520\n JFK will go to the moon in this decade, not because it's easy, but because it is hard.\n\n2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:30.320\n There's no discussion about short term political gains or any of that kind of stuff in the\n\n2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:37.200\n vision of going to the moon, or going to Mars, or taking on gigantic projects, or taking\n\n2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:42.400\n on world hunger, or taking on climate change, or the education system, all those things\n\n2:05:42.400 --> 2:05:47.360\n that require long term significant investment. That requires...\n\n2:05:47.360 --> 2:05:53.440\n But it's hard to find those people. And incidentally, I think another problem, which is a downside\n\n2:05:53.440 --> 2:06:01.120\n of social media, is that of younger people I know, the number who would contemplate a\n\n2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:07.440\n political career has gone down because of the pressures on them and their family from\n\n2:06:07.440 --> 2:06:14.560\n social media. It's a hell of a job now. And so I think we are all losers because the quality\n\n2:06:14.560 --> 2:06:24.240\n of people who choose that path is really dropping. And as we see by the quality of those who\n\n2:06:24.240 --> 2:06:25.360\n are in these compositions.\n\n2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:31.840\n That said, I think the silver lining there is the quality of the competition actually\n\n2:06:31.840 --> 2:06:39.200\n is inspiring because it shows to you that there's a dire need of leaders, which I think\n\n2:06:39.200 --> 2:06:43.600\n would be inspiring to young people to step into the fold. I mean, great leaders are not\n\n2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:51.200\n afraid of a little bit of fire on social media. So if you have a 20 year old kid now, 25 year\n\n2:06:51.200 --> 2:06:57.680\n old kid is seeing how the world has responded to the pandemic, seeing the geopolitical division\n\n2:06:57.680 --> 2:07:03.520\n over the war in Ukraine, seeing the brewing war between the West and China. We need great\n\n2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:11.520\n leaders and there's a hunger for them and the time will come when they step up. I believe\n\n2:07:11.520 --> 2:07:16.480\n that. But also to add to your list of four, he doesn't get enough credit. I've been defending\n\n2:07:16.480 --> 2:07:22.880\n him in this conversation, Elon Musk, in terms of the fight in climate change. But he also\n\n2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:27.120\n has led to a lot of division, but we need more David Edinburgh.\n\n2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:33.040\n Yeah, no, no. I mean, I'm a fan. Definitely. I mean, I've heard him described as a 21st\n\n2:07:33.040 --> 2:07:40.320\n century Brunel for his innovation and that's true. But whether he's an ethical inspiration,\n\n2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:41.680\n I don't know.\n\n2:07:41.680 --> 2:07:48.960\n Yeah, he has a lot of fun on Twitter. Well, let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat.\n\n2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:56.240\n What advice would you give to young people today? Maybe they're teenagers in high school,\n\n2:07:56.240 --> 2:08:04.560\n maybe early college. What advice would you give to a career or have a life they can be\n\n2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:05.360\n proud of?\n\n2:08:05.360 --> 2:08:14.480\n Yes. Well, I'd be very diffident, really, about offering any wisdom. But I think they\n\n2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:26.720\n should realise that the choices they make at that time are important. And from the experience\n\n2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:33.200\n I've had with many friends, many people don't realise that opportunities open until it's\n\n2:08:33.200 --> 2:08:38.560\n too late. They somehow think that some opportunities are only open to a few privileged people and\n\n2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:48.720\n they don't even try and that they could succeed. But if I focus on people working in some profession\n\n2:08:48.720 --> 2:08:56.000\n I know about, like science, I would say pick an area to work in where new things are happening,\n\n2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:02.640\n where you can do something that the old guys never had a chance to think about. Don't go\n\n2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:07.680\n into a field that's fairly stagnant because then there's nothing much to do or you'll\n\n2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:12.160\n be trying to tackle the problems that the old guys got stuck on. And so I think in science,\n\n2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:19.200\n I can give people good advice that they should pick a subject where there are exciting new\n\n2:09:19.200 --> 2:09:24.560\n developments. And also, of course, something which suits their style because even within\n\n2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:29.520\n science, which is just one profession, there's a big range of style between the sort of solitary\n\n2:09:29.520 --> 2:09:34.080\n thinker, the person who does field work, the person who works in a big team, et cetera,\n\n2:09:34.080 --> 2:09:40.560\n and whether you like computing or mathematical thought, et cetera. So pick some subject that\n\n2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:46.960\n suits your style and where things are happening fast. And be prepared to be flexible. That's what\n\n2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:51.600\n I'd say, really. Keep your eyes open for the opportunity throughout, like you said. Go to\n\n2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:56.240\n a new field. Go to a field where new cool stuff is happening. Just keep your eyes open.\n\n2:09:56.240 --> 2:10:01.840\n Yes, that's patitudinous. But I think most of us, and I include myself in this, didn't realize\n\n2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:03.200\n this sort of thing isn't too late.\n\n2:10:05.840 --> 2:10:13.440\n Yeah, I think this applies way beyond science. What do you make of this finiteness of our life?\n\n2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:18.560\n Do you think about death? Do you think about mortality? Do you think about your mortality?\n\n2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:20.320\n And are you afraid of death?\n\n2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:25.600\n Well, I mean, I'm not afraid because I think I'm lucky. I feel lucky to have lasted as long as I\n\n2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:35.040\n have and to have been fairly lucky in my life in many respects compared to most people. So I feel\n\n2:10:35.040 --> 2:10:44.960\n very fortunate. This reminds me of this current emphasis on living much longer, the so called\n\n2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:53.680\n Altos Laboratories, which have been set up by billionaires. There's one in San Francisco,\n\n2:10:53.680 --> 2:11:03.280\n one in La Jolla, I think, and one in Cambridge. And they're funded by these guys who when young\n\n2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:07.840\n wanted to be rich, and now they're rich, they want to be young again. They won't find that quite so\n\n2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:14.560\n easy. And do we want this? I don't know. If there was some elite that was able to live much longer\n\n2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:23.040\n than others, that would be a really fundamental kind of inequality. And I think if it happened\n\n2:11:23.040 --> 2:11:32.800\n to everyone, then that might be an improvement. It's not so obvious. But I think for my part,\n\n2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:39.280\n I think to have lived as long as most people and had a fortunate life is all I can\n\n2:11:39.280 --> 2:11:44.720\n expect and a lot to be grateful for. Those are all past issues.\n\n2:11:44.720 --> 2:11:50.800\n Well, I am incredibly honored that you sit down with me today. I thank you so much for life,\n\n2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:57.360\n of exploring some of the deepest mysteries of our universe and of our humanity and thinking\n\n2:11:57.360 --> 2:12:02.960\n about our future with existential risks that are before us. It's a huge honor,\n\n2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:06.240\n Martin, that you sit with me and I really enjoyed it.\n\n2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:09.440\n Well, thank you, Lex. I thought we couldn't go on for as long as this,\n\n2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:11.600\n but we could have gone on much longer.\n\n2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:16.480\n Exactly. Thank you so much. Thank you for listening to this conversation with Martin\n\n2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:21.520\n Rees. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now,\n\n2:12:21.520 --> 2:12:23.920\n let me leave you with some words from Martin Rees himself.\n\n2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:30.640\n I'd like to widen people's awareness of the tremendous time spent lying ahead for our planet\n\n2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:37.440\n and for life itself. Most educated people are aware that we're the outcome of nearly 4 billion\n\n2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:44.000\n years of Darwinian selection, but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination.\n\n2:12:44.880 --> 2:12:51.360\n Our sun, however, is less than halfway through its lifespan. It will not be humans who watch\n\n2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:58.400\n the sun's demise 6 billion years from now. Any creatures that then exist will be as different\n\n2:12:58.400 --> 2:13:16.080\n from us as we are from bacteria or amoeba. Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
