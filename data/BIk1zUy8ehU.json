  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:02.720\n The following is a conversation with Michael Malice,\n\n00:02.720 --> 00:05.800\n an anarchist, political thinker, author,\n\n00:05.800 --> 00:10.160\n and a proud, part time, Andy Kaufman like troll,\n\n00:10.160 --> 00:11.940\n in the best sense of that word,\n\n00:11.940 --> 00:14.960\n on both Twitter and in real life.\n\n00:14.960 --> 00:18.640\n He's a host of a great podcast called You're Welcome,\n\n00:18.640 --> 00:20.920\n spelled Y O U R.\n\n00:20.920 --> 00:23.520\n I think that gives a sense of his sense of humor.\n\n00:23.520 --> 00:25.960\n He is the author of Dear Reader,\n\n00:25.960 --> 00:29.600\n the unauthorized autobiography of King Jong Il,\n\n00:29.600 --> 00:31.040\n and The New Right,\n\n00:31.040 --> 00:33.880\n A Journey to the Fringe of American Politics.\n\n00:33.880 --> 00:36.040\n This latter book, when I read it,\n\n00:36.040 --> 00:38.520\n or rather listened to it last year,\n\n00:38.520 --> 00:40.620\n helped me start learning about the various\n\n00:40.620 --> 00:43.600\n disparate movements that I was undereducated about,\n\n00:43.600 --> 00:46.920\n from the internet trolls, to Alex Jones,\n\n00:46.920 --> 00:51.440\n to white nationalists, and to techno anarchists.\n\n00:51.440 --> 00:54.680\n The book is funny and brilliant, and so is Michael.\n\n00:54.680 --> 00:58.120\n Unfortunately, because of a self imposed deadline,\n\n00:58.120 --> 01:01.280\n I actually pulled an all nighter before this conversation.\n\n01:01.280 --> 01:03.880\n So I was not exactly all there mentally,\n\n01:03.880 --> 01:06.360\n even more so than usual, which is tough,\n\n01:06.360 --> 01:09.880\n because Michael is really quick witted and brilliant.\n\n01:09.880 --> 01:12.440\n But he was kind, patient, and understanding\n\n01:12.440 --> 01:16.080\n in this conversation, and I hope you will be as well.\n\n01:16.080 --> 01:18.080\n Today, I'm trying something a little new,\n\n01:18.080 --> 01:21.960\n looking to establish a regular structure for these intros.\n\n01:21.960 --> 01:25.000\n A first, doing the guest intro, like I just did.\n\n01:25.000 --> 01:28.960\n Second, quick one or two sentence mention of each sponsor.\n\n01:28.960 --> 01:32.280\n Third, my side comments related to the episode.\n\n01:32.280 --> 01:35.000\n And finally, fourth, full ad reads\n\n01:35.000 --> 01:36.760\n on the audio side of things,\n\n01:36.760 --> 01:39.560\n and on YouTube, going straight to the conversation.\n\n01:39.560 --> 01:41.520\n So not doing the full ad reads.\n\n01:41.520 --> 01:43.560\n And as always, no ads in the middle,\n\n01:43.560 --> 01:46.600\n because to me, they get in the way of the conversation.\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:48.520\n So, quick mention of the sponsors.\n\n01:48.520 --> 01:51.400\n First, SEMrush, the most advanced\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:54.320\n SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.\n\n01:54.320 --> 01:56.080\n I don't like looking at numbers,\n\n01:56.080 --> 01:57.520\n but someone probably should.\n\n01:57.520 --> 02:00.000\n It helps you make good decisions.\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.000\n Second sponsor is DoorDash, food delivery service\n\n02:03.000 --> 02:04.640\n that I've used for many years\n\n02:04.640 --> 02:07.640\n to fuel long, uninterrupted sessions of deep work\n\n02:07.640 --> 02:11.840\n at Google, MIT, and I still use it a lot today.\n\n02:11.840 --> 02:14.880\n Third sponsor is Masterclass, online courses\n\n02:14.880 --> 02:16.720\n from the best people in the world\n\n02:16.720 --> 02:18.560\n on each of the topics covered,\n\n02:18.560 --> 02:21.040\n from rockets, to game design, to poker,\n\n02:21.040 --> 02:25.360\n to writing, and to guitar with Carlos Santana.\n\n02:25.360 --> 02:27.280\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n02:27.280 --> 02:30.800\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n02:30.800 --> 02:33.040\n As a side note, let me say that I hope to have\n\n02:33.040 --> 02:35.680\n some conversations with political thinkers,\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:38.160\n including liberals and conservatives,\n\n02:38.160 --> 02:41.080\n anarchists, libertarians, objectivists,\n\n02:41.080 --> 02:42.920\n and everything in between.\n\n02:42.920 --> 02:46.480\n I'm as allergic to Trump bashing and Trump worship\n\n02:46.480 --> 02:48.160\n as you probably are.\n\n02:48.160 --> 02:49.800\n I have none of that in me.\n\n02:49.800 --> 02:52.040\n I really work hard to be open minded\n\n02:52.040 --> 02:54.600\n and let my curiosity drive the conversation.\n\n02:54.600 --> 02:57.760\n I do plead with you to be patient on two counts.\n\n02:57.760 --> 03:00.560\n First, I have an intense, busy life\n\n03:00.560 --> 03:02.360\n outside of these podcasts.\n\n03:02.360 --> 03:05.520\n Like it's 4 a.m. right now as I'm recording this.\n\n03:05.520 --> 03:08.360\n So sometimes life affects these conversations,\n\n03:08.360 --> 03:11.240\n like in this case, I pull an all nighter beforehand.\n\n03:11.240 --> 03:13.240\n So please be patient with me if I say something\n\n03:13.240 --> 03:17.640\n inelegant, confusing, dumb, or just plain wrong.\n\n03:17.640 --> 03:19.680\n I'll try to correct myself on social media\n\n03:19.680 --> 03:22.400\n or in future conversations as much as I can.\n\n03:22.400 --> 03:26.040\n I really am always learning and working hard to improve.\n\n03:26.040 --> 03:29.920\n Second, if I or the guest says something about,\n\n03:29.920 --> 03:33.080\n for example, our current president, Donald Trump,\n\n03:33.080 --> 03:36.920\n that's over the top negative or over the top positive,\n\n03:36.920 --> 03:39.760\n please don't let your brain go into the partisan mode.\n\n03:39.760 --> 03:43.240\n Try to hear our words in an open minded nuanced way.\n\n03:43.240 --> 03:45.840\n And if we say stuff from a place of emotion,\n\n03:45.840 --> 03:47.440\n please give us a pass.\n\n03:47.440 --> 03:49.720\n Nuanced conversation can only happen\n\n03:49.720 --> 03:51.360\n if we're patient with each other.\n\n03:52.360 --> 03:54.200\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n03:54.200 --> 03:56.560\n review the Five Stars and Apple podcast,\n\n03:56.560 --> 03:58.920\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,\n\n03:58.920 --> 04:02.460\n or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n04:02.460 --> 04:06.280\n And now, here's my conversation with Michael Malice.\n\n04:07.240 --> 04:09.360\n There was a Simpsons episode where he starts mixing\n\n04:09.360 --> 04:12.400\n like sleeping pills with like pet pills\n\n04:12.400 --> 04:13.920\n and he's driving his truck and I'm like,\n\n04:13.920 --> 04:15.480\n I wanna see what happens if he mixed Red Bull\n\n04:15.480 --> 04:17.600\n and Nitra cold brew.\n\n04:17.600 --> 04:20.700\n There's a lineup of drugs.\n\n04:21.800 --> 04:23.640\n This is gonna be so fun.\n\n04:23.640 --> 04:25.720\n Yeah, let's start with love.\n\n04:28.840 --> 04:31.680\n Yeah, so one thing we'll eventually somehow talk about,\n\n04:31.680 --> 04:34.240\n it'll be a theme throughout, is that you're also Russian.\n\n04:34.240 --> 04:35.080\n Yes.\n\n04:35.080 --> 04:36.920\n A little bit less than me, but.\n\n04:36.920 --> 04:37.840\n How, why?\n\n04:37.840 --> 04:39.600\n Cause I'm from Ukraine.\n\n04:39.600 --> 04:40.560\n Oh, you're from Ukraine?\n\n04:40.560 --> 04:41.400\n From above.\n\n04:41.400 --> 04:42.320\n Okay, wow.\n\n04:42.320 --> 04:43.960\n No, because you came here a little bit\n\n04:43.960 --> 04:44.840\n when you were younger.\n\n04:44.840 --> 04:45.680\n Yeah.\n\n04:45.680 --> 04:47.720\n I came here when I was 13,\n\n04:47.720 --> 04:49.960\n so I saturated a little bit of the Russian soul.\n\n04:49.960 --> 04:52.520\n I marinated in the Russian soul a little deeper.\n\n04:52.520 --> 04:53.600\n I haven't told anyone this,\n\n04:53.600 --> 04:55.700\n but I'll be glad to tell you, Davidish.\n\n04:56.720 --> 04:59.160\n I haven't been back since I was two.\n\n04:59.160 --> 05:01.400\n And next summer, it looks like me and my buddy,\n\n05:01.400 --> 05:03.240\n Chris Williamson, who's also a podcaster,\n\n05:03.240 --> 05:06.280\n he's British, Modern Wisdom, he looks like Apollo.\n\n05:06.280 --> 05:07.480\n Looks like we got a videographer.\n\n05:07.480 --> 05:08.320\n Which Apollo?\n\n05:08.320 --> 05:09.160\n Apollo Creed?\n\n05:09.160 --> 05:10.200\n The god, he looks like the god Apollo.\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:11.040\n Yeah, he's like a model.\n\n05:11.040 --> 05:13.760\n I thought you were talking about Rocky.\n\n05:13.760 --> 05:16.640\n So, we're gonna go for the first time\n\n05:16.640 --> 05:18.500\n to see where I came from.\n\n05:18.500 --> 05:19.920\n Which is in Ukraine.\n\n05:19.920 --> 05:22.360\n We're gonna go to Lvov and either St. Petersburg or Moscow,\n\n05:22.360 --> 05:24.860\n probably St. Petersburg, or both.\n\n05:24.860 --> 05:25.760\n It's gonna be intense.\n\n05:25.760 --> 05:28.480\n It's gonna be a lot of panic attacks, I feel.\n\n05:28.480 --> 05:30.600\n And your Russian is okay?\n\n05:30.600 --> 05:31.440\n Yeah.\n\n05:31.440 --> 05:33.160\n How do you think?\n\n05:33.160 --> 05:34.000\n Good?\n\n05:34.000 --> 05:34.820\n Do you understand?\n\n05:34.820 --> 05:35.920\n No, you can't talk Russian in Ukraine,\n\n05:35.920 --> 05:37.440\n or it's like they get offended.\n\n05:37.440 --> 05:39.920\n Yeah, but then you also wanna go to Russia.\n\n05:39.920 --> 05:41.360\n Yeah.\n\n05:41.360 --> 05:42.940\n I don't know.\n\n05:42.940 --> 05:44.800\n For me, there's several people in Russia\n\n05:44.800 --> 05:47.000\n I wanna interview on a podcast.\n\n05:47.000 --> 05:49.640\n So, one of them is Gagarin Perlman,\n\n05:49.640 --> 05:53.720\n which is a mathematician, and the other person is Putin.\n\n05:53.720 --> 05:55.680\n You know what my favorite Putin story is?\n\n05:55.680 --> 05:56.500\n Do you know this?\n\n05:56.500 --> 05:57.340\n No.\n\n05:57.340 --> 05:58.520\n When he had Merkel with him, do you know this story?\n\n05:58.520 --> 05:59.360\n No.\n\n05:59.360 --> 06:02.160\n Merkel's scared of dogs, like petrified of dogs.\n\n06:02.160 --> 06:06.160\n So, he brings in his like black lab.\n\n06:06.160 --> 06:08.240\n It's a Labrador, it's like the sweetest animal,\n\n06:08.240 --> 06:09.760\n and it's all over her, and there's pictures,\n\n06:09.760 --> 06:12.040\n and she's sitting like this, and she's terrified,\n\n06:12.040 --> 06:13.720\n and he's like, what's wrong, Angela?\n\n06:13.720 --> 06:15.460\n He's just completely trolling her.\n\n06:16.560 --> 06:20.800\n Yeah, he's aware of the sort of the narrative around him.\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:21.640\n Yeah.\n\n06:21.640 --> 06:22.480\n And then he plays with it.\n\n06:22.480 --> 06:23.300\n Yes.\n\n06:23.300 --> 06:24.140\n He enjoys it.\n\n06:24.140 --> 06:24.980\n It's a very Russian thing.\n\n06:24.980 --> 06:26.280\n My friend wanted to do a film about me.\n\n06:26.280 --> 06:28.600\n He goes, I realized you guys aren't like us at all.\n\n06:28.600 --> 06:30.080\n You're just like, look at us,\n\n06:30.080 --> 06:31.440\n and then I started telling him stories\n\n06:31.440 --> 06:33.520\n about the upbringing, and he's like, oh my God,\n\n06:33.520 --> 06:34.560\n and as I'm telling them, I'm like,\n\n06:34.560 --> 06:38.440\n wow, this stuff is really crazy, like how we are wired.\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:39.260\n Who's the we?\n\n06:39.260 --> 06:40.100\n Your friend is?\n\n06:40.100 --> 06:40.920\n The Russian, the friend's American.\n\n06:40.920 --> 06:42.920\n I'm saying the way Russians are brought up,\n\n06:42.920 --> 06:45.160\n and the way, maybe, I don't think it was just my family.\n\n06:45.160 --> 06:46.600\n I bet you had similar things.\n\n06:46.600 --> 06:47.680\n Here's an example.\n\n06:47.680 --> 06:50.400\n I was, I had a buddy staying with me.\n\n06:50.400 --> 06:51.360\n He had a problem with his roommate,\n\n06:51.360 --> 06:53.120\n so he crashed at my place, fine.\n\n06:53.120 --> 06:56.540\n I went to the gym, and I come back,\n\n06:56.540 --> 06:58.320\n and he goes, oh, there was,\n\n06:58.320 --> 07:00.440\n and my apartment building is four four apartments,\n\n07:00.440 --> 07:02.000\n so it's not like a huge thing.\n\n07:02.000 --> 07:04.440\n He goes, oh, there was someone knocking at your door,\n\n07:04.440 --> 07:08.900\n so I told him blah blah, and for me,\n\n07:08.900 --> 07:10.960\n and I wonder if you're the same way,\n\n07:10.960 --> 07:12.920\n if I'm at someone's house that's not my own,\n\n07:12.920 --> 07:14.660\n and someone knocks on the door,\n\n07:14.660 --> 07:16.600\n I wouldn't even think to answer it.\n\n07:16.600 --> 07:18.920\n Like if I had an apple here, maybe I'd eat it,\n\n07:18.920 --> 07:20.360\n I'd cut it, whatever.\n\n07:20.360 --> 07:21.860\n I'm not gonna, it just doesn't enter my head\n\n07:21.860 --> 07:23.160\n to smash into my face.\n\n07:23.160 --> 07:26.420\n The thought of answering the door, if it's not my house,\n\n07:26.420 --> 07:27.440\n it would never enter my head.\n\n07:27.440 --> 07:28.640\n Would it enter your head?\n\n07:28.640 --> 07:30.080\n No, but why?\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:31.760\n But he's an American, so someone's at the door.\n\n07:31.760 --> 07:33.680\n He goes and opens it, even though it's not his house.\n\n07:33.680 --> 07:34.740\n I would never do that.\n\n07:34.740 --> 07:36.860\n I would never think to do that.\n\n07:36.860 --> 07:39.880\n That is so strange that you pick some very obscure thing\n\n07:39.880 --> 07:42.040\n to delineate Americans and Russians.\n\n07:42.040 --> 07:43.040\n I don't think that's obscure,\n\n07:43.040 --> 07:46.560\n because I think it speaks to how we perceive strangers.\n\n07:46.560 --> 07:48.280\n With Americans, everyone's friendly,\n\n07:48.280 --> 07:52.000\n and with us, it's like, no, no, you have that moat,\n\n07:52.000 --> 07:55.200\n and I think that percolates into many different aspects\n\n07:55.200 --> 07:58.020\n of how we relate to people, and I have to undo a lot of that.\n\n07:58.020 --> 07:58.860\n That's true.\n\n07:58.860 --> 08:00.880\n You're right, there's the relationship I formed there\n\n08:00.880 --> 08:04.120\n where in Russia, we're very deep and close,\n\n08:04.120 --> 08:06.320\n and then there's the strangers, the other,\n\n08:06.320 --> 08:08.920\n that you don't trust by default.\n\n08:08.920 --> 08:11.280\n It takes a long time to go over the moat of trust.\n\n08:11.280 --> 08:13.880\n For a long time, until recently,\n\n08:13.880 --> 08:15.440\n whenever I said anything to anyone,\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:20.440\n my brain ran a scan that said, if this person turns on you,\n\n08:20.760 --> 08:22.640\n would this, can they use this against you?\n\n08:22.640 --> 08:24.800\n And I would do this with everything I said with strangers,\n\n08:24.800 --> 08:26.320\n and after a while, it's like, you know what?\n\n08:26.320 --> 08:28.200\n Maybe they will, but I'm strong enough to take it,\n\n08:28.200 --> 08:30.560\n but this is not how Americans think.\n\n08:30.560 --> 08:31.400\n Or here's another one.\n\n08:31.400 --> 08:32.220\n Let me ask you this.\n\n08:32.220 --> 08:33.060\n Sorry, I'm taking over the interview.\n\n08:33.060 --> 08:35.680\n People ask about advice for work, right?\n\n08:35.680 --> 08:37.920\n Like I had this, there was this party I went to,\n\n08:37.920 --> 08:39.560\n and basically everyone had their own problems,\n\n08:39.560 --> 08:41.280\n and everyone else gave their advice, right?\n\n08:41.280 --> 08:43.380\n And someone's having a problem with a coworker,\n\n08:43.380 --> 08:46.820\n and the advice these Tupoy Americans gave them is,\n\n08:46.820 --> 08:48.800\n oh, sit down and have a talk with them.\n\n08:48.800 --> 08:52.920\n And to me, this is like the last case, last resort.\n\n08:52.920 --> 08:54.520\n Like first, you have to see what you can\n\n08:54.520 --> 08:56.960\n without showing your hand, showing your vulnerability,\n\n08:56.960 --> 08:58.700\n only when everything hasn't worked out,\n\n08:58.700 --> 09:00.200\n or you're like, all right, let me sit down with you\n\n09:00.200 --> 09:02.120\n and try to have it out with you, probably.\n\n09:02.120 --> 09:04.680\n But for them, the first thing is like, sit down and be like,\n\n09:04.680 --> 09:06.940\n oh, you're causing me problems, blah, blah, blah.\n\n09:06.940 --> 09:09.340\n So I perceive that right away as a threat,\n\n09:09.340 --> 09:11.440\n that this person sees an antagonism between us,\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:13.680\n and also as a weakness that I'm getting to them.\n\n09:13.680 --> 09:17.240\n So my reaction isn't how do I make it better?\n\n09:17.240 --> 09:20.200\n My reaction is to reinforce my position\n\n09:20.200 --> 09:23.640\n and see what I can to marginalize them, usually.\n\n09:23.640 --> 09:25.680\n I haven't worked in a corporate setting in a long time.\n\n09:25.680 --> 09:27.780\n But it's not, I don't approach it the way an American would.\n\n09:27.780 --> 09:29.040\n Like, I'm glad you came and talked to me.\n\n09:29.040 --> 09:31.520\n Now I probably would, because it's gonna be a friend.\n\n09:31.520 --> 09:34.580\n So you attribute that to the Russian upbringing,\n\n09:34.580 --> 09:37.980\n as opposed to you have deep psychological issues.\n\n09:37.980 --> 09:39.820\n I think those are synonymous, don't you?\n\n09:39.820 --> 09:44.400\n Wait, would you think differently, maybe a few years ago?\n\n09:46.580 --> 09:50.400\n I don't know, I think you lost me at the,\n\n09:50.400 --> 09:52.260\n because you kind of said that,\n\n09:52.260 --> 09:54.020\n you're kind of implying you have a deep distrust\n\n09:54.020 --> 09:57.260\n of the world, like the world is.\n\n09:57.260 --> 09:59.860\n I think the default setting would be distrust, yeah.\n\n09:59.860 --> 10:04.860\n But I would put it differently,\n\n10:05.540 --> 10:09.380\n is I almost ignore the rest of the world,\n\n10:09.380 --> 10:14.020\n I don't even acknowledge it, I just savor,\n\n10:14.020 --> 10:18.660\n I save my love and trust for the small circle of people.\n\n10:18.660 --> 10:21.220\n I agree, but when that person is being confrontational,\n\n10:21.220 --> 10:24.020\n or as they perceive it, as being open,\n\n10:24.020 --> 10:27.300\n now there's a situation, how would you handle that?\n\n10:27.300 --> 10:31.260\n Like a cold wind blows, you just kind of like.\n\n10:31.260 --> 10:33.340\n Yeah, but it's not like this is an opportunity\n\n10:33.340 --> 10:36.340\n for us to work out our differences, it's a cold wind.\n\n10:36.340 --> 10:38.500\n It's not a hug, that's my point.\n\n10:38.500 --> 10:41.700\n Americans think it's a hug, a cold wind.\n\n10:41.700 --> 10:45.180\n You're so suspicious, what it really is, is a cold wind.\n\n10:46.860 --> 10:50.380\n I'm so humane, it's not something to be scared of,\n\n10:50.380 --> 10:52.580\n it's a cold wind, it's a good person.\n\n10:52.580 --> 10:56.060\n But it's not, this is great, but it's not a source of,\n\n10:56.060 --> 11:00.620\n like I'm not suspicious of, like I'm not anxious,\n\n11:00.620 --> 11:02.940\n I would say, or like living in fear\n\n11:02.940 --> 11:04.540\n of the rest of the world, I'm more.\n\n11:04.540 --> 11:07.420\n Oh, I agree, but you're not receptive to that person.\n\n11:07.420 --> 11:09.460\n That's all I'm saying, and they are.\n\n11:09.460 --> 11:12.740\n Got it, so speaking of which, let's talk about love.\n\n11:14.380 --> 11:18.820\n Which requires to be receptive of the world, of strangers.\n\n11:19.780 --> 11:23.060\n How do we put more love out there in the world,\n\n11:23.060 --> 11:25.340\n especially on the internet?\n\n11:25.340 --> 11:30.340\n One mechanism I have found to increase love,\n\n11:30.380 --> 11:31.900\n and that's a word that has many meanings\n\n11:31.900 --> 11:33.940\n and is used in a very intense sense\n\n11:33.940 --> 11:35.380\n and is used in a very loose sense.\n\n11:35.380 --> 11:36.860\n Can you try to define love?\n\n11:36.860 --> 11:41.860\n Sure, love is a strong sense of attraction\n\n11:42.100 --> 11:46.940\n toward another person, entity, or place\n\n11:46.940 --> 11:51.340\n that causes one to tend to react\n\n11:51.340 --> 11:53.540\n in a disproportionately positive manner.\n\n11:53.540 --> 11:54.380\n That's off the top of my head.\n\n11:54.380 --> 11:55.460\n Disproportionately.\n\n11:55.460 --> 11:57.660\n Yes, so for example, if you.\n\n11:57.660 --> 11:58.740\n Why not proportionately?\n\n11:58.740 --> 12:02.700\n Because if someone's about to, who you love,\n\n12:02.700 --> 12:05.660\n is about to get harmed, you're moving heaven and earth\n\n12:05.660 --> 12:08.820\n to make sure, or like a book you love.\n\n12:08.820 --> 12:10.460\n I love this book, like you're going through the fire\n\n12:10.460 --> 12:13.140\n to try to save it, whereas if it's a book you really like,\n\n12:13.140 --> 12:15.100\n it's like, oh, I'll get another one.\n\n12:16.500 --> 12:18.580\n And a book's kind of a loose example, but.\n\n12:18.580 --> 12:20.140\n So you're going with the love that's like,\n\n12:20.140 --> 12:22.220\n you're saving for just a few people,\n\n12:22.220 --> 12:25.060\n almost like romantical, like love for a close family.\n\n12:25.060 --> 12:28.780\n But what about just love to even the broader,\n\n12:28.780 --> 12:30.900\n like the kind of love you can put out\n\n12:30.900 --> 12:33.860\n to people on the internet, which is like just kindness.\n\n12:33.860 --> 12:35.300\n Sure, I would say in that case,\n\n12:35.300 --> 12:40.300\n it's important to make them feel seen and validated.\n\n12:41.460 --> 12:44.860\n And I try to do this when people who I have come to know\n\n12:44.860 --> 12:46.600\n on the internet, and there's a lot,\n\n12:46.600 --> 12:48.780\n I try to do that as much as possible\n\n12:48.780 --> 12:51.420\n because I don't think it's valid\n\n12:51.420 --> 12:53.780\n how on social media, and I do this a lot myself,\n\n12:53.780 --> 12:55.140\n but not towards everyone,\n\n12:55.140 --> 12:58.300\n it's just there to be aggressive and antagonistic.\n\n12:58.300 --> 13:00.580\n You should be antagonistic towards bad people,\n\n13:00.580 --> 13:02.780\n and that's fine, but at the same time,\n\n13:02.780 --> 13:04.400\n there's lots of great people.\n\n13:04.400 --> 13:06.100\n And especially with my audience,\n\n13:06.100 --> 13:08.500\n and I would bet disproportionately with yours,\n\n13:08.500 --> 13:10.300\n there's lots of people who are,\n\n13:10.300 --> 13:13.300\n because of their psychology and intelligence,\n\n13:13.300 --> 13:17.220\n are going to be much more isolated socially than they should.\n\n13:17.220 --> 13:19.340\n And if I, and I've heard from many of them,\n\n13:19.340 --> 13:21.180\n and if I'm the person who makes them feel,\n\n13:21.180 --> 13:24.180\n oh, I'm not crazy, it's everyone else around me\n\n13:24.180 --> 13:27.700\n who is just basic, the fact that I can be that person,\n\n13:27.700 --> 13:29.520\n which I didn't have at their age,\n\n13:29.520 --> 13:32.460\n to me is incredibly reaffirming.\n\n13:32.460 --> 13:34.100\n You mean that source of love?\n\n13:34.100 --> 13:36.140\n But I mean love in the sense of like,\n\n13:36.140 --> 13:37.700\n you know, you care about this person\n\n13:37.700 --> 13:38.760\n and you want good things for them,\n\n13:38.760 --> 13:40.140\n not in a kind of romantic way.\n\n13:40.140 --> 13:42.460\n But I mean, you're using it in a broad sense now.\n\n13:42.460 --> 13:44.900\n Yeah, but you're also a person who kind of,\n\n13:44.900 --> 13:49.900\n I mean, attacks the power structures in the world\n\n13:52.060 --> 13:54.740\n by mocking them effectively.\n\n13:54.740 --> 13:59.740\n And love, I would say, requires you to be\n\n14:00.780 --> 14:04.660\n non witty and simple and fragile,\n\n14:04.660 --> 14:08.220\n which I see it as like the opposite of what trolls do.\n\n14:08.220 --> 14:15.220\n Trolls are, if there is someone coming after what I love,\n\n14:15.220 --> 14:18.740\n there's two mechanisms, right, at least two.\n\n14:18.740 --> 14:20.780\n I go up and I'm fighting them,\n\n14:20.780 --> 14:24.660\n and in which case you are getting hurt in a knife fight,\n\n14:24.660 --> 14:26.420\n even if you win the knife fight,\n\n14:26.420 --> 14:30.100\n or if you disarm them and you preclude\n\n14:30.100 --> 14:32.420\n the possibility of a fight and you drive them off\n\n14:32.420 --> 14:34.100\n or render them powerless,\n\n14:34.100 --> 14:37.860\n you keep your person intact as yourself\n\n14:37.860 --> 14:39.660\n and you also protect your values.\n\n14:39.660 --> 14:41.660\n So how do you render them powerless?\n\n14:41.660 --> 14:43.220\n As you just said, by mocking them.\n\n14:43.220 --> 14:46.300\n One of the most effective mechanisms for those in power,\n\n14:46.300 --> 14:48.980\n we're much closer to Brave New World than 1984.\n\n14:48.980 --> 14:51.060\n The people who are dominant and in power\n\n14:51.060 --> 14:54.700\n aren't there because of the threat of the gulag or prison.\n\n14:54.700 --> 14:56.420\n They're there because of social pressures.\n\n14:56.420 --> 14:57.960\n Look at the masks.\n\n14:57.960 --> 15:01.560\n I was on the subway not that long ago in New York City.\n\n15:01.560 --> 15:04.060\n No one cared who I was until I put off the mask.\n\n15:04.060 --> 15:06.100\n I was in the subway that long in New York City.\n\n15:06.100 --> 15:07.140\n And I put this on my Instagram.\n\n15:07.140 --> 15:08.300\n I've told this story before.\n\n15:08.300 --> 15:10.100\n There was an Asian dude in his early 30s.\n\n15:10.100 --> 15:11.380\n He was like in Western clothes.\n\n15:11.380 --> 15:13.420\n It's not like he had a rickshaw or something.\n\n15:13.420 --> 15:16.860\n An older man in his 50s stood up over him on the subway,\n\n15:16.860 --> 15:20.440\n screamed at him, said, go back where you came from.\n\n15:20.440 --> 15:21.280\n You're disgusting.\n\n15:21.280 --> 15:22.220\n I'm gonna get sick.\n\n15:22.220 --> 15:23.920\n If you think this guy is a vector of disease,\n\n15:23.920 --> 15:25.820\n which is your prerogative, why are you coming close to him?\n\n15:25.820 --> 15:27.380\n Why are you getting in his face?\n\n15:27.380 --> 15:28.380\n And what?\n\n15:28.380 --> 15:32.100\n Sorry, so it was because he was Asian?\n\n15:32.100 --> 15:32.940\n It was both.\n\n15:32.940 --> 15:37.580\n It was the not having a mask gave him the permission\n\n15:37.580 --> 15:41.180\n to act like a despicable, aggressive person toward him.\n\n15:41.180 --> 15:44.980\n And the point being, a lot of these mechanisms\n\n15:44.980 --> 15:49.260\n for social control are outsourced to low quality people\n\n15:49.260 --> 15:50.620\n because this is their one chance\n\n15:50.620 --> 15:53.240\n to assert dominance and status over somebody else.\n\n15:53.240 --> 15:54.940\n So the best way to diffuse that\n\n15:54.940 --> 15:56.820\n isn't with weaponry or fighting.\n\n15:56.820 --> 15:58.980\n It's through mockery because all of a sudden,\n\n15:58.980 --> 16:01.760\n their claims to authority are effectively destroyed.\n\n16:01.760 --> 16:02.980\n So let me push back on that.\n\n16:02.980 --> 16:06.940\n What about fighting that with love,\n\n16:06.940 --> 16:10.940\n with patience and kindness towards them?\n\n16:10.940 --> 16:12.860\n I don't think kindness is,\n\n16:12.860 --> 16:16.060\n I think that would be a mismatch and inappropriate.\n\n16:16.060 --> 16:18.180\n There's Superman, there's Batman, okay?\n\n16:18.180 --> 16:20.020\n And Superman's job is to help the good people\n\n16:20.020 --> 16:22.120\n and Batman's job is to hurt the bad people.\n\n16:22.120 --> 16:25.200\n And I will always be on the Batman side\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:26.300\n than the Superman side.\n\n16:27.340 --> 16:29.880\n Both work silly tight costumes.\n\n16:29.880 --> 16:31.660\n One has pointy ears.\n\n16:31.660 --> 16:33.460\n Both are ridiculous, so let's.\n\n16:33.460 --> 16:36.220\n One's a billionaire who gets, he's swimming in trim.\n\n16:36.220 --> 16:37.900\n Which one is a billionaire? Batman.\n\n16:37.900 --> 16:42.900\n Okay, I'm undereducated on the superhero movies,\n\n16:42.900 --> 16:44.420\n I apologize.\n\n16:44.420 --> 16:48.260\n Okay, but you're just saying your predisposition\n\n16:48.260 --> 16:50.540\n is to be on the Batman side,\n\n16:50.540 --> 16:54.660\n is to fighting the bad guys.\n\n16:54.660 --> 16:57.340\n Yeah, and it's what I'm good at.\n\n16:57.340 --> 16:58.540\n That's what you're good at.\n\n16:58.540 --> 17:02.500\n But just to play devil's advocate,\n\n17:02.500 --> 17:04.580\n or actually, in this case, I am the devil\n\n17:04.580 --> 17:06.380\n because it's what I usually do.\n\n17:06.380 --> 17:08.460\n Well, I'm the devil, you're the angel's advocate.\n\n17:08.460 --> 17:12.280\n Exactly, to be the angel advocate, yeah.\n\n17:12.280 --> 17:15.180\n Is like, I feel like mockery\n\n17:17.820 --> 17:20.380\n is a path towards escalation of conflict.\n\n17:20.380 --> 17:22.100\n Yes, in many ways, yes.\n\n17:22.100 --> 17:25.000\n So you're not, I mean,\n\n17:25.000 --> 17:28.520\n it's kind of like guerrilla warfare.\n\n17:28.520 --> 17:31.440\n I mean, you're not going to win.\n\n17:31.440 --> 17:32.760\n I am winning, we're all winning.\n\n17:32.760 --> 17:33.900\n We're winning on a daily.\n\n17:33.900 --> 17:35.680\n This is my next book, we're winning.\n\n17:35.680 --> 17:37.400\n We've won before, I'm not joking.\n\n17:37.400 --> 17:39.040\n The topic of the next book.\n\n17:39.040 --> 17:40.600\n Yes, it's the white pill.\n\n17:40.600 --> 17:41.440\n The white pill.\n\n17:41.440 --> 17:43.660\n Is that we're gonna, we are winning.\n\n17:43.660 --> 17:46.300\n The most horrible people are being rendered\n\n17:46.300 --> 17:49.080\n into laughing stocks on a daily basis on social media.\n\n17:49.080 --> 17:49.920\n This is a glorious thing.\n\n17:49.920 --> 17:52.120\n This is good, I so disagree with you.\n\n17:52.120 --> 17:54.120\n I disagree with you because there's side effects\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:55.940\n that are very destructive.\n\n17:55.940 --> 17:57.520\n It feels like you're winning,\n\n17:57.520 --> 18:00.360\n but we're completely destroying the possibility\n\n18:00.360 --> 18:04.640\n of having like a cohesive society.\n\n18:04.640 --> 18:06.720\n That's called oncology.\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:07.840\n What's that mean?\n\n18:07.840 --> 18:09.060\n Curing cancer.\n\n18:09.060 --> 18:09.900\n No, I, yeah.\n\n18:09.900 --> 18:12.880\n Your concept of a cohesive society is, in fact,\n\n18:12.880 --> 18:15.720\n a society based on oppression\n\n18:15.720 --> 18:20.120\n and not allowing individuals to live their personal freedom.\n\n18:20.120 --> 18:22.520\n Oh, so you're a utopian view of the world.\n\n18:22.520 --> 18:23.420\n You're the utopian.\n\n18:23.420 --> 18:24.760\n You're saying cohesive society.\n\n18:24.760 --> 18:25.820\n I'm saying I don't need that.\n\n18:25.820 --> 18:27.620\n I'm saying there's gonna be conflict.\n\n18:27.620 --> 18:29.120\n Right, there's gonna be conflict.\n\n18:29.120 --> 18:30.320\n You and I are disagreeing right now.\n\n18:30.320 --> 18:31.360\n That's not cohesive.\n\n18:31.360 --> 18:32.600\n Doesn't mean we like each other less.\n\n18:32.600 --> 18:34.520\n Doesn't mean we respect each other less.\n\n18:34.520 --> 18:37.040\n Cohesive doesn't, it's just a euphemism\n\n18:37.040 --> 18:39.960\n for like everyone submitting to what I want.\n\n18:39.960 --> 18:43.720\n No, I mean, cohesive could be that.\n\n18:43.720 --> 18:48.160\n It could be like enforced with violence,\n\n18:48.160 --> 18:49.000\n all that kind of stuff,\n\n18:49.000 --> 18:53.200\n sort of the libertarian view of the world,\n\n18:53.200 --> 18:57.240\n but it could just be being respectful\n\n18:57.240 --> 19:00.400\n and kind of each other and kind towards each other\n\n19:00.400 --> 19:02.660\n and loving towards each other.\n\n19:02.660 --> 19:04.620\n I mean, that's what I mean by cohesive.\n\n19:04.620 --> 19:07.600\n So when people say free, it's funny.\n\n19:07.600 --> 19:10.000\n Like freedom is a funny thing\n\n19:10.000 --> 19:14.240\n because freedom could be painful to a lot of people.\n\n19:15.940 --> 19:18.000\n It's all matters how you define it,\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:20.280\n how you implement it, how it actually looks like.\n\n19:20.280 --> 19:21.120\n Sure.\n\n19:21.120 --> 19:26.120\n I'm just saying it feels like the mockery\n\n19:26.880 --> 19:31.460\n of the powerful leads to further and further divisions.\n\n19:31.460 --> 19:36.360\n It's like it's turning life into a game\n\n19:36.360 --> 19:40.280\n to where it's always you're creating\n\n19:40.280 --> 19:43.040\n these different little tribes and groups\n\n19:43.040 --> 19:48.040\n and you're constantly fighting the groups\n\n19:48.340 --> 19:50.280\n that become a little bit more powerful\n\n19:50.280 --> 19:53.400\n by undercutting them through guerrilla warfare kind of thing.\n\n19:53.400 --> 19:54.920\n And that's what the internet becomes\n\n19:54.920 --> 19:56.760\n is everyone's just mocking each other\n\n19:56.760 --> 19:59.240\n and then certain groups become more and more powerful\n\n19:59.240 --> 20:01.840\n and then they start fighting each other\n\n20:01.840 --> 20:05.600\n and they form groups of ideologies\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:07.560\n and they start fighting each other in the internet\n\n20:07.560 --> 20:11.280\n where the result is it doesn't feel like\n\n20:12.440 --> 20:14.600\n the common humanities highlighted.\n\n20:14.600 --> 20:19.360\n It doesn't feel like that's a path of progress.\n\n20:19.360 --> 20:21.400\n Now, like when I say cohesive,\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:25.840\n I don't mean like everybody has to be enforcing equality,\n\n20:25.840 --> 20:27.240\n all those kinds of ideas.\n\n20:27.240 --> 20:30.600\n I just mean like not being so divisive.\n\n20:31.920 --> 20:34.440\n So it's going back to the original question of like,\n\n20:34.440 --> 20:37.440\n how do we put more love out in the world than the internet?\n\n20:37.440 --> 20:39.780\n I want divisiveness.\n\n20:39.780 --> 20:41.120\n Oh, you see, you think divisiveness is that?\n\n20:41.120 --> 20:41.960\n That's the goal.\n\n20:41.960 --> 20:42.780\n That's very interesting.\n\n20:42.780 --> 20:43.620\n It's the goal.\n\n20:43.620 --> 20:44.920\n So you started this conversation\n\n20:44.920 --> 20:46.100\n where you're talking about you have love\n\n20:46.100 --> 20:47.440\n for that small group.\n\n20:47.440 --> 20:50.240\n I think we both would agree to have a bigger group\n\n20:50.240 --> 20:51.080\n would be better,\n\n20:51.080 --> 20:53.560\n especially if that love comes from a sincere place.\n\n20:53.560 --> 20:56.400\n I think our country,\n\n20:56.400 --> 20:57.680\n I wrote an article about this four years ago\n\n20:57.680 --> 21:00.900\n that it's time to disunite the states and to secede.\n\n21:00.900 --> 21:02.280\n This country has been held together\n\n21:02.280 --> 21:04.160\n with at least two separate cultures\n\n21:04.160 --> 21:06.800\n with dumb text and string for over 20 years.\n\n21:06.800 --> 21:08.800\n There's an enormous amount of contempt\n\n21:08.800 --> 21:10.800\n from one group toward another.\n\n21:10.800 --> 21:12.880\n This contempt comes from a sincere place.\n\n21:12.880 --> 21:14.900\n They do not share each other's values.\n\n21:14.900 --> 21:16.680\n There's absolutely no reason,\n\n21:16.680 --> 21:18.360\n just like any unhealthy relationship\n\n21:18.360 --> 21:19.640\n where you can't say, you know what?\n\n21:19.640 --> 21:20.960\n It's not working out.\n\n21:20.960 --> 21:24.400\n I want to go my own way and live my happiness.\n\n21:24.400 --> 21:26.440\n And I genuinely want you to go your way,\n\n21:26.440 --> 21:27.360\n live your happiness.\n\n21:27.360 --> 21:28.800\n If I'm wrong, prove me wrong.\n\n21:28.800 --> 21:31.860\n I'll learn from you and take lessons and vice versa.\n\n21:31.860 --> 21:33.320\n But the fact that we all have to be\n\n21:33.320 --> 21:35.680\n in the same house together is not coherent.\n\n21:35.680 --> 21:36.500\n And that's not love.\n\n21:36.500 --> 21:40.700\n That is the path towards friction and tension and conflict.\n\n21:40.700 --> 21:43.960\n Do you think there's concrete groups?\n\n21:43.960 --> 21:47.040\n Like is it as simple as the two groups of blue and red?\n\n21:47.040 --> 21:49.920\n No, it's also very fluid\n\n21:49.920 --> 21:53.560\n because you and I are allied as Jewish people,\n\n21:53.560 --> 21:57.040\n as Russians, as males, as podcasters.\n\n21:57.040 --> 21:58.560\n You're an academic, I'm not.\n\n21:58.560 --> 22:02.800\n So we're different, but we each are a Venn diagram,\n\n22:02.800 --> 22:04.440\n even within ourselves.\n\n22:04.440 --> 22:07.000\n And I can talk to you about politics\n\n22:07.000 --> 22:08.640\n and then we can talk about Russia stuff.\n\n22:08.640 --> 22:10.840\n And then you could talk about your work,\n\n22:10.840 --> 22:12.100\n which I don't know anything about.\n\n22:12.100 --> 22:14.400\n So that'd be where you're way up here and a way down here.\n\n22:14.400 --> 22:16.280\n So there's lots, every relationship\n\n22:16.280 --> 22:18.920\n with just between individuals, it's very dynamic.\n\n22:18.920 --> 22:20.640\n So how do we succeed?\n\n22:20.640 --> 22:22.640\n Like how do we form individual states\n\n22:22.640 --> 22:25.900\n where there's a little bit more cohesion?\n\n22:25.900 --> 22:27.720\n Sure, and voluntary cohesion.\n\n22:27.720 --> 22:31.600\n So the first step is to eliminate\n\n22:31.600 --> 22:35.360\n and the concept of political authority as legitimate\n\n22:35.360 --> 22:38.200\n and to denigrate and humiliate those\n\n22:38.200 --> 22:40.800\n who would put themselves in a position\n\n22:40.800 --> 22:44.200\n in which they are there to tell you how to live your life\n\n22:44.200 --> 22:46.600\n from any semblance of validity.\n\n22:46.600 --> 22:48.440\n And that's starting to happen.\n\n22:48.440 --> 22:50.680\n If you look at what they had with the lockdowns,\n\n22:50.680 --> 22:52.320\n Cuomo and de Blasio, New York,\n\n22:53.320 --> 22:56.000\n I was tired a couple of weeks ago.\n\n22:56.000 --> 22:58.440\n And I said to my friend, oh, just click, maybe I have COVID.\n\n22:58.440 --> 23:00.640\n And he goes, it's not possible, like what do you mean?\n\n23:00.640 --> 23:04.780\n And he goes, we haven't had any deaths in like two months.\n\n23:04.780 --> 23:08.080\n And there's only like 100 cases a day for like two months.\n\n23:08.080 --> 23:09.300\n And I go, you're exaggerating\n\n23:09.300 --> 23:11.040\n because everything was still closed.\n\n23:11.040 --> 23:13.900\n And I looked at the numbers and he wasn't exaggerating.\n\n23:13.900 --> 23:16.880\n And there's no greater American dream to me\n\n23:16.880 --> 23:19.920\n than an immigrant family comes to the states,\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:21.820\n forms their own little business.\n\n23:21.820 --> 23:23.420\n Maybe mom's a good cook, it's a restaurant,\n\n23:23.420 --> 23:25.260\n dry cleaner, fruit stand.\n\n23:25.260 --> 23:27.980\n And those people aren't gonna have a lot of money.\n\n23:27.980 --> 23:30.320\n Those are the first ones who lost their companies\n\n23:30.320 --> 23:32.360\n because of these lockdowns.\n\n23:33.600 --> 23:35.160\n Cuomo, who's the governor of New York,\n\n23:35.160 --> 23:38.080\n opened up the gyms, he said, you're clear to open up.\n\n23:38.080 --> 23:40.340\n De Blasio said, and we don't have enough inspectors,\n\n23:40.340 --> 23:43.080\n you're gonna have to wait another couple of weeks.\n\n23:43.080 --> 23:45.880\n To regard that as anything other than literally criminal\n\n23:45.880 --> 23:49.460\n is something that I am having a hard and harder time\n\n23:49.460 --> 23:51.120\n wrapping my head around.\n\n23:51.120 --> 23:52.600\n You said, I mean, that's something\n\n23:52.600 --> 23:54.280\n I'm deeply worried about as well,\n\n23:54.280 --> 23:58.380\n which is like thousands, it's actually millions\n\n23:58.380 --> 24:01.280\n of dreams being crushed, that American dream\n\n24:01.280 --> 24:03.720\n of starting a business, of running a business.\n\n24:03.720 --> 24:06.240\n What about all the young people who you and I\n\n24:06.240 --> 24:10.080\n have in our audiences who are socially isolated at best,\n\n24:10.080 --> 24:11.960\n and now they can't leave their homes?\n\n24:12.840 --> 24:15.100\n Isolation and ostracism are things\n\n24:15.100 --> 24:17.240\n that are very well studied in psychology.\n\n24:17.240 --> 24:19.320\n These have extreme consequences.\n\n24:19.320 --> 24:22.640\n I read a book called Ostracism, and this wasn't scientific,\n\n24:22.640 --> 24:24.400\n but basically the author was a psychiatrist,\n\n24:24.400 --> 24:26.880\n psychologist, whatever, and he had one of his colleagues,\n\n24:26.880 --> 24:29.080\n they did an experiment, let's for a week,\n\n24:29.080 --> 24:30.600\n you ostracize me completely.\n\n24:30.600 --> 24:33.040\n We know it's an, and he goes, even knowing\n\n24:33.040 --> 24:34.680\n it's the experiment, the fact that he wouldn't\n\n24:34.680 --> 24:37.040\n make eye contact with me and the fact that he ignored me\n\n24:37.040 --> 24:40.880\n had an extreme emotional impact on me,\n\n24:40.880 --> 24:44.020\n knowing full well this is purely for experimental purposes.\n\n24:44.020 --> 24:46.360\n Now you multiply that by all these, the suicide,\n\n24:46.360 --> 24:48.000\n the number of kids who were thinking about suicide\n\n24:48.000 --> 24:50.160\n was through the roof during all this.\n\n24:50.160 --> 24:53.300\n And my point is, until these people,\n\n24:53.300 --> 24:55.800\n it's gonna, I would predict like 2024,\n\n24:55.800 --> 24:57.840\n that's where we're gonna have to start having conversations\n\n24:57.840 --> 25:00.140\n about what personal consequences have to be done\n\n25:00.140 --> 25:01.720\n for these people, because until then,\n\n25:01.720 --> 25:03.400\n they're gonna do the same thing.\n\n25:03.400 --> 25:06.120\n So you think there's going to be society wide consequences\n\n25:06.120 --> 25:08.800\n of this that we're gonna see, like ripple effects,\n\n25:08.800 --> 25:10.440\n because of the social isolation?\n\n25:10.440 --> 25:13.280\n I know, I mean, we also need to talk about consequences\n\n25:13.280 --> 25:16.440\n for Cuomo and de Blasio, because if politicians\n\n25:16.440 --> 25:18.820\n respond to incentives, and the incentives are there\n\n25:18.820 --> 25:20.800\n for them to be extremely conservative,\n\n25:20.800 --> 25:22.560\n because if you have to choose, as Cuomo said\n\n25:22.560 --> 25:25.160\n in a press conference, between a thousand people dying\n\n25:25.160 --> 25:26.480\n and a thousand people losing their business,\n\n25:26.480 --> 25:28.360\n it's not a hard choice, and he's right.\n\n25:28.360 --> 25:30.860\n But at a certain point, it's like, all right,\n\n25:30.860 --> 25:35.120\n you're losing both, you're making these decisions\n\n25:35.120 --> 25:36.900\n and not having consequences for it,\n\n25:36.900 --> 25:38.740\n and you're gonna do it again the next time,\n\n25:38.740 --> 25:41.200\n so we need to make sure you're a little scared.\n\n25:41.200 --> 25:42.880\n And I don't know what that would mean.\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:47.880\n But you're laying this problem, this incompetence.\n\n25:48.920 --> 25:50.080\n I don't think it's incompetence,\n\n25:50.080 --> 25:51.720\n I think it's very competent.\n\n25:51.720 --> 25:54.600\n I think their job is to be able, yes.\n\n25:54.600 --> 25:59.000\n But you're laying it not at the hands of the individuals,\n\n25:59.000 --> 26:01.400\n but the structure of government.\n\n26:01.400 --> 26:02.360\n It's both, yes.\n\n26:03.360 --> 26:05.760\n How would we deal with it better\n\n26:05.760 --> 26:07.980\n without centralized control?\n\n26:07.980 --> 26:09.440\n Well, we didn't really have centralized control,\n\n26:09.440 --> 26:11.160\n because every country and every state\n\n26:11.160 --> 26:12.840\n handled it in a different mechanism.\n\n26:12.840 --> 26:16.240\n But a city has centralized control, right?\n\n26:16.240 --> 26:17.080\n No, that's not true.\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:19.400\n So Cuomo and de Blasio, they had a lot of disagreements\n\n26:19.400 --> 26:21.200\n over this over the months, and this was actually\n\n26:21.200 --> 26:23.520\n a source of great interest and tension.\n\n26:23.520 --> 26:26.160\n De Blasio wanted, at one point, was talking about\n\n26:26.160 --> 26:27.840\n quarantining people in their homes.\n\n26:27.840 --> 26:29.920\n Cuomo was like, you're crazy.\n\n26:29.920 --> 26:33.040\n Same thing with the schools, same thing with the gyms,\n\n26:33.040 --> 26:35.840\n and there were other such examples.\n\n26:35.840 --> 26:38.240\n But the point being, this was an emergency.\n\n26:38.240 --> 26:41.920\n World War I, I talked about this on Tim Poole's show,\n\n26:41.920 --> 26:45.680\n was very dangerous, because it gave a lot of evil people\n\n26:45.680 --> 26:48.160\n some very useful information about what the country\n\n26:48.160 --> 26:51.160\n put up with and what they can get away with under wartime.\n\n26:51.160 --> 26:53.680\n And this set the model for things like the New Deal\n\n26:53.680 --> 26:55.880\n and the other things of that nature.\n\n26:55.880 --> 26:57.480\n It is undeniable, you're a scientist,\n\n26:57.480 --> 27:00.240\n so you understand this perfectly well,\n\n27:00.240 --> 27:04.080\n that this lockdown gave some very nefarious people\n\n27:04.080 --> 27:07.440\n some very valid data about how much people\n\n27:07.440 --> 27:11.600\n were put up with under pressures from the state.\n\n27:13.320 --> 27:16.120\n So fundamentally, what is the problem with the state?\n\n27:16.120 --> 27:17.240\n Its existence.\n\n27:17.240 --> 27:22.240\n Okay, well, but to play angel's advocate again,\n\n27:22.240 --> 27:25.120\n angel's advocate again, you know,\n\n27:25.120 --> 27:28.200\n government is the people.\n\n27:28.200 --> 27:31.880\n Come on, do you really think this?\n\n27:31.880 --> 27:35.560\n As best I think as possible to have representation.\n\n27:35.560 --> 27:37.200\n Can you imagine if you have an attorney?\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:38.760\n You're like, oh, you can't have the attorney you want.\n\n27:38.760 --> 27:40.240\n You're gonna have this guy who you absolutely hate\n\n27:40.240 --> 27:42.320\n who you share no values with, why?\n\n27:42.320 --> 27:45.280\n Because he drives, I mean, leaders, political leaders,\n\n27:45.280 --> 27:48.240\n and political representation drive the discourse.\n\n27:48.240 --> 27:53.000\n Like the majority of people voted for him or whatever,\n\n27:53.000 --> 27:55.040\n however you define that.\n\n27:55.040 --> 27:58.560\n And now we get to have a discussion,\n\n27:58.560 --> 28:01.120\n well, was this the right choice?\n\n28:01.120 --> 28:02.720\n And then we get to make that choice again\n\n28:02.720 --> 28:04.080\n in four years and so on.\n\n28:04.080 --> 28:06.640\n First of all, the fact that I have to be under the thumb\n\n28:06.640 --> 28:09.160\n of somebody for four years makes no sense.\n\n28:09.160 --> 28:10.680\n There's no other relationship that's like this,\n\n28:10.680 --> 28:12.200\n including a marriage.\n\n28:12.200 --> 28:14.440\n You can leave any other relationship at any time,\n\n28:14.440 --> 28:15.320\n number one.\n\n28:15.320 --> 28:16.160\n Number two is.\n\n28:16.160 --> 28:17.480\n You could always impeach.\n\n28:17.480 --> 28:18.320\n Well, they did that.\n\n28:18.320 --> 28:22.520\n Part of it I'm just saying that the mechanisms\n\n28:22.520 --> 28:24.400\n are flawed in many ways, yeah.\n\n28:24.400 --> 28:26.960\n Yeah, right, and so that's number one.\n\n28:26.960 --> 28:29.720\n Number two is it doesn't make sense\n\n28:29.720 --> 28:32.880\n that if I don't want someone to represent me\n\n28:32.880 --> 28:35.240\n that because that person is popular\n\n28:35.240 --> 28:36.600\n that they are now in a position to.\n\n28:36.600 --> 28:40.600\n So having representation and having citizenship\n\n28:40.600 --> 28:44.320\n based on geography is a prelandline technology\n\n28:44.320 --> 28:45.840\n in a post cell phone world.\n\n28:45.840 --> 28:48.080\n There's no reason why I have to,\n\n28:48.080 --> 28:50.760\n just because we're physically in between two oceans,\n\n28:50.760 --> 28:52.960\n we all have to be represented by the same people,\n\n28:52.960 --> 28:55.500\n whereas I can very easily have my security\n\n28:55.500 --> 28:57.480\n be under someone and switch it as easily\n\n28:57.480 --> 28:58.720\n as cell phone providers.\n\n28:58.720 --> 29:01.080\n So, okay, but it doesn't have to be geographical.\n\n29:01.080 --> 29:02.600\n It can be ideas.\n\n29:02.600 --> 29:03.440\n Sure.\n\n29:03.440 --> 29:05.280\n I mean, this country represents a certain set of ideas.\n\n29:05.280 --> 29:06.120\n Yes, it does.\n\n29:06.120 --> 29:07.680\n It started out geographically.\n\n29:07.680 --> 29:08.520\n It still is geographic.\n\n29:08.520 --> 29:09.360\n It was both.\n\n29:09.360 --> 29:10.200\n It started off as ideas as well.\n\n29:10.200 --> 29:12.520\n But like, it was intricately.\n\n29:12.520 --> 29:14.640\n I mean, that's the way humans are.\n\n29:14.640 --> 29:17.120\n I mean, there was no internet.\n\n29:17.120 --> 29:19.760\n So it was, you were geographically in the same location\n\n29:19.760 --> 29:21.160\n and you signed a bunch of documents\n\n29:21.160 --> 29:22.520\n and then you kind of debated\n\n29:22.520 --> 29:24.500\n and you wrote a bunch of stuff\n\n29:24.500 --> 29:26.480\n and then you agreed on it.\n\n29:26.480 --> 29:27.320\n Okay.\n\n29:27.320 --> 29:29.480\n You understand that no one signed these documents\n\n29:29.480 --> 29:30.680\n and no one agreed to it.\n\n29:30.680 --> 29:33.760\n As Lysander Spooner pointed out over 150 years ago,\n\n29:33.760 --> 29:36.760\n the constitution or the social contract, if anything,\n\n29:36.760 --> 29:38.940\n is only binding to the signatories.\n\n29:38.940 --> 29:41.440\n And even then they're all long dead.\n\n29:41.440 --> 29:43.700\n So it's this fallacy that somehow,\n\n29:43.700 --> 29:45.880\n because I'm in a physical place,\n\n29:45.880 --> 29:48.500\n I've agreed, even though I'm screaming through your face\n\n29:48.500 --> 29:49.560\n that I don't agree,\n\n29:49.560 --> 29:54.440\n to be subordinate to some imaginary, invisible monster\n\n29:54.440 --> 29:56.280\n that was created 250 years ago.\n\n29:56.280 --> 29:57.960\n And this idea of like, if you don't like it,\n\n29:57.960 --> 29:58.800\n you have to move.\n\n29:58.800 --> 29:59.920\n That's not what freedom means.\n\n29:59.920 --> 30:02.080\n Freedom means I do what I want, not what you want.\n\n30:02.080 --> 30:04.520\n So if you don't like it, you move.\n\n30:04.520 --> 30:08.280\n Okay, just to put some, I don't like words and terms.\n\n30:08.280 --> 30:09.680\n One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, one.\n\n30:09.680 --> 30:10.520\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:11.600\n Is that what your language is?\n\n30:11.600 --> 30:14.520\n It is, I'm translating it all in real time.\n\n30:14.520 --> 30:18.120\n But would you call the kind of ideas\n\n30:18.120 --> 30:19.960\n that you're advocating for\n\n30:19.960 --> 30:21.560\n and we're talking about anarchy?\n\n30:21.560 --> 30:23.300\n Yes, anarchism, yes.\n\n30:23.300 --> 30:24.560\n Okay, so let's get into it.\n\n30:24.560 --> 30:29.560\n Can you try to paint the utopia\n\n30:29.640 --> 30:33.600\n that an anarchist worldview dreams about?\n\n30:33.600 --> 30:36.240\n The only people who describe anarchism as utopia\n\n30:36.240 --> 30:37.520\n are its critics.\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:39.620\n If I told you right now,\n\n30:39.620 --> 30:41.240\n and I wish I could say this factually,\n\n30:41.240 --> 30:42.880\n that I have a cure for cancer,\n\n30:42.880 --> 30:45.200\n that would not make us a utopia.\n\n30:45.200 --> 30:47.280\n That would still probably be expensive.\n\n30:47.280 --> 30:49.000\n We would still have many other diseases.\n\n30:49.000 --> 30:51.880\n However, we would be fundamentally healthier,\n\n30:51.880 --> 30:55.000\n happier and better off, all of us.\n\n30:55.000 --> 30:56.080\n Than democracy.\n\n30:56.080 --> 30:58.680\n So, sorry, I jumped back from the cancer.\n\n30:58.680 --> 31:00.640\n No, than democracy or government.\n\n31:00.640 --> 31:03.640\n So it's only curing one major,\n\n31:03.640 --> 31:05.560\n major life threatening problem,\n\n31:05.560 --> 31:08.120\n but in no sense is it a utopia.\n\n31:08.120 --> 31:12.120\n So what, can we try to answer this question,\n\n31:12.120 --> 31:13.640\n same question many times,\n\n31:13.640 --> 31:17.640\n which is what exactly is the problem with democracy?\n\n31:17.640 --> 31:19.960\n The problem with democracy is that those who need leaders\n\n31:19.960 --> 31:21.560\n are not qualified to choose them.\n\n31:22.640 --> 31:27.640\n Those who need leaders are not qualified to choose them.\n\n31:28.160 --> 31:29.080\n So.\n\n31:29.080 --> 31:30.560\n That's the central problem with democracy.\n\n31:30.560 --> 31:32.400\n Not all of us need leaders.\n\n31:32.400 --> 31:33.240\n Right.\n\n31:33.240 --> 31:38.240\n So, what does it mean to need a leader?\n\n31:38.600 --> 31:41.360\n Are you saying like people who are actually\n\n31:41.360 --> 31:44.240\n like free thinkers don't need leaders kind of thing?\n\n31:44.240 --> 31:45.480\n Sure.\n\n31:45.480 --> 31:46.520\n That's a good way of working.\n\n31:46.520 --> 31:47.880\n But like, you don't, okay.\n\n31:47.880 --> 31:51.920\n So do you acknowledge that there's some value\n\n31:51.920 --> 31:56.000\n in authority in different subjects?\n\n31:56.000 --> 31:57.880\n So what that means is,\n\n31:57.880 --> 32:00.080\n I don't mean authority, somebody who's in control of you,\n\n32:00.080 --> 32:00.920\n but.\n\n32:00.920 --> 32:04.120\n But you're doing the definition switch.\n\n32:04.120 --> 32:04.960\n Because.\n\n32:04.960 --> 32:05.800\n I am, I am.\n\n32:05.800 --> 32:06.640\n You're right, you're right.\n\n32:06.640 --> 32:07.480\n It's unfair.\n\n32:07.480 --> 32:08.320\n Okay, that was bad.\n\n32:08.320 --> 32:09.160\n But that's what they do.\n\n32:09.160 --> 32:10.040\n That's their trick.\n\n32:10.040 --> 32:10.880\n Yeah.\n\n32:10.880 --> 32:12.240\n And this is one of the useful things,\n\n32:12.240 --> 32:14.080\n by the way, that's this total sidebar.\n\n32:14.080 --> 32:15.480\n If people ask me for advice,\n\n32:15.480 --> 32:17.000\n I always tell them if you're gonna raise your kids,\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:18.680\n raise them bilingual.\n\n32:18.680 --> 32:20.800\n Because I was trilingual by the time I was six\n\n32:20.800 --> 32:23.080\n and that teaches you to think in concepts.\n\n32:23.080 --> 32:24.680\n Whereas if you only know one language,\n\n32:24.680 --> 32:26.120\n you fall for things like this,\n\n32:26.120 --> 32:28.560\n because using authority in the sense of a policeman\n\n32:28.560 --> 32:30.480\n and someone has authority in physics,\n\n32:30.480 --> 32:31.560\n it's the same word.\n\n32:31.560 --> 32:33.520\n Conceptually, they're extremely different.\n\n32:33.520 --> 32:35.480\n But if you're only thinking in one language,\n\n32:35.480 --> 32:37.680\n your brain is going to equate the two.\n\n32:37.680 --> 32:38.960\n And that's a trap that people\n\n32:38.960 --> 32:40.240\n who only speak one language have.\n\n32:40.240 --> 32:41.080\n For sure.\n\n32:41.080 --> 32:42.800\n But even if you know multiple languages,\n\n32:42.800 --> 32:44.520\n you can still use the trick of using\n\n32:44.520 --> 32:45.680\n the worst of your convenience.\n\n32:45.680 --> 32:46.520\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n32:46.520 --> 32:48.080\n To manipulate the conversation.\n\n32:48.080 --> 32:49.320\n But you weren't trying to do that,\n\n32:49.320 --> 32:50.240\n but you fell into that.\n\n32:50.240 --> 32:51.240\n I accidentally did it.\n\n32:51.240 --> 32:52.080\n Yeah, you're right.\n\n32:52.080 --> 32:53.960\n We all tend to do that if you only speak one language\n\n32:53.960 --> 32:55.000\n and think in one language.\n\n32:55.000 --> 32:57.600\n But if, I guess let me rephrase it.\n\n32:57.600 --> 33:02.360\n Are you against, do you acknowledge the value\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:07.040\n of offloading your own effort\n\n33:07.040 --> 33:09.280\n about a particular thing to somebody else?\n\n33:09.280 --> 33:10.120\n Absolutely.\n\n33:10.120 --> 33:12.880\n Like an accountant, a lawyer, a doctor,\n\n33:12.880 --> 33:15.080\n absolute, a chef, infinite.\n\n33:15.080 --> 33:18.560\n Isn't that ultimately what a democracy is?\n\n33:18.560 --> 33:19.400\n No.\n\n33:19.400 --> 33:21.600\n Broadly defined, like you're basically electing\n\n33:21.600 --> 33:22.920\n a bunch of authorities.\n\n33:22.920 --> 33:25.080\n Using the word you in two senses.\n\n33:25.080 --> 33:26.840\n Using the word you meaning me as an individual,\n\n33:26.840 --> 33:28.200\n not using you as a mass.\n\n33:29.040 --> 33:31.520\n Yeah, as a mass, not you as an individual.\n\n33:31.520 --> 33:34.240\n Right, so I would absolutely want someone\n\n33:34.240 --> 33:35.680\n to provide for my security.\n\n33:35.680 --> 33:38.160\n I would absolutely want someone to negotiate with me\n\n33:38.160 --> 33:39.840\n for foreign power or something like that.\n\n33:39.840 --> 33:42.440\n That does not mean it has to be predicated\n\n33:42.440 --> 33:44.680\n and what lots of other people who I do not know\n\n33:44.680 --> 33:47.280\n and if I do know them, probably would not respect,\n\n33:47.280 --> 33:48.160\n think about.\n\n33:48.160 --> 33:50.680\n It's of no moral relevance to me.\n\n33:51.600 --> 33:52.760\n Nor I to them.\n\n33:52.760 --> 33:54.240\n So do you think this kind of,\n\n33:54.240 --> 33:57.840\n there could be a bunch of humans that behave\n\n33:57.840 --> 34:01.440\n kind of like ants in a distributed way.\n\n34:01.440 --> 34:04.880\n There could be an emergent behavior in them\n\n34:04.880 --> 34:06.960\n that results in a stable society.\n\n34:06.960 --> 34:09.040\n Like isn't that the hope with anarchy\n\n34:09.040 --> 34:12.240\n is like without an overarching.\n\n34:13.320 --> 34:15.600\n But ants, I mean ants are the worst example here\n\n34:15.600 --> 34:17.720\n because ants have a very firm authority.\n\n34:17.720 --> 34:18.560\n The queen?\n\n34:18.560 --> 34:20.560\n Yeah, and they're all drones.\n\n34:20.560 --> 34:22.360\n They're all clones of each other.\n\n34:22.360 --> 34:24.880\n Yeah, but so if you forget the queen,\n\n34:24.880 --> 34:26.400\n their behavior, they're all,\n\n34:27.600 --> 34:28.960\n well from your perspective,\n\n34:28.960 --> 34:30.760\n from your human intelligent perspective,\n\n34:30.760 --> 34:31.800\n but from their perspective,\n\n34:31.800 --> 34:33.920\n they probably see each other as a bunch of individuals.\n\n34:33.920 --> 34:34.760\n No they don't.\n\n34:34.760 --> 34:36.800\n Ants are very big on altruism\n\n34:36.800 --> 34:38.400\n in the sense of self sacrifice.\n\n34:40.880 --> 34:42.440\n They do not think the individual matters.\n\n34:42.440 --> 34:44.800\n They routinely kill themselves\n\n34:44.800 --> 34:46.840\n for the sake of the hive in the community.\n\n34:46.840 --> 34:49.280\n But they, see that's from the outside perspective,\n\n34:49.280 --> 34:51.560\n from the individual perspective of the individual,\n\n34:51.560 --> 34:56.560\n they probably, they don't see it as altruism.\n\n34:57.600 --> 35:00.360\n Right, but they view and they're right\n\n35:00.360 --> 35:02.760\n because the ants life is very ephemeral and cheap,\n\n35:02.760 --> 35:06.240\n that it's more important to continue this mass population\n\n35:06.240 --> 35:08.720\n that one individual ant live.\n\n35:08.720 --> 35:10.600\n Like bees are another even better example.\n\n35:10.600 --> 35:12.040\n The honeybee, when they sting,\n\n35:12.040 --> 35:13.720\n they only sting once and they die.\n\n35:13.720 --> 35:15.440\n And they do it gladly because it's like,\n\n35:15.440 --> 35:18.160\n okay, this community is much more important than me\n\n35:18.160 --> 35:19.840\n and they're right.\n\n35:19.840 --> 35:22.280\n Yeah, okay, so fine, let's forget.\n\n35:22.280 --> 35:24.440\n I'm being pedantic, but it's important, I think.\n\n35:24.440 --> 35:25.440\n I'm not just being pedantic\n\n35:25.440 --> 35:26.480\n for the sake of being pedantic.\n\n35:26.480 --> 35:29.360\n But there's something beautiful that I won't argue about\n\n35:29.360 --> 35:31.920\n because I do, there's an interesting point there\n\n35:31.920 --> 35:33.400\n about individualism of ants.\n\n35:33.400 --> 35:35.160\n I do think they're more individual.\n\n35:35.160 --> 35:40.160\n But let's give your view of ants that they're communists.\n\n35:40.200 --> 35:42.680\n Okay, let's go with the communist view of ants.\n\n35:42.680 --> 35:43.520\n Okay, yeah.\n\n35:44.440 --> 35:46.880\n But they're still a beautiful emergent thing,\n\n35:46.880 --> 35:51.320\n which is like they can function as a society\n\n35:51.320 --> 35:56.320\n and without, I would say, centralized control.\n\n35:57.800 --> 35:58.640\n Yeah, I agree with you.\n\n35:58.640 --> 35:59.480\n It's another argument.\n\n35:59.480 --> 36:01.040\n So is that the hope for anarchy?\n\n36:01.040 --> 36:03.200\n It's like you just throw a bunch of people\n\n36:03.200 --> 36:05.520\n that voluntarily wanna be in the same place\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:06.880\n under the same set of ideas\n\n36:06.880 --> 36:10.400\n and they kind of, like the doctors emerge,\n\n36:10.400 --> 36:12.600\n the police officers emerge,\n\n36:12.600 --> 36:15.160\n the different necessary structures\n\n36:15.160 --> 36:17.000\n of a functional society emerge.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:20.640\n Do you know what the most beautiful example of anarchism is\n\n36:20.640 --> 36:22.520\n that is just beyond beautiful\n\n36:22.520 --> 36:23.360\n when you stop to think about it?\n\n36:23.360 --> 36:24.240\n I'll see Twitter.\n\n36:24.240 --> 36:25.400\n I'm not being tongue in cheek.\n\n36:25.400 --> 36:26.240\n Okay.\n\n36:26.240 --> 36:27.080\n Language.\n\n36:28.040 --> 36:29.720\n There's infinite languages.\n\n36:29.720 --> 36:33.040\n Language, the things that language can be used for\n\n36:33.040 --> 36:36.240\n are bring tears to people's eyes quite literally.\n\n36:36.240 --> 36:38.960\n It's also used for basic things.\n\n36:38.960 --> 36:40.200\n No one is forcing us.\n\n36:40.200 --> 36:42.640\n We speak two languages each at least.\n\n36:42.640 --> 36:44.440\n No one's forcing us to use English.\n\n36:44.440 --> 36:47.800\n No one's forcing us to use this dialect of English.\n\n36:47.800 --> 36:50.920\n It's a way, and despite there being\n\n36:50.920 --> 36:54.760\n so many different languages, lingua franca emerge,\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:56.600\n the language that everyone is, Latin.\n\n36:56.600 --> 36:59.080\n Even in North Korea, they refer to the fish\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:02.600\n and the different animals by the Latin scientific note.\n\n37:02.600 --> 37:03.800\n No one decided this.\n\n37:03.800 --> 37:05.240\n Sure, there's an organization\n\n37:05.240 --> 37:07.280\n that sets a binomial nomenclature,\n\n37:07.280 --> 37:08.920\n but there's no gun to anyone's head\n\n37:08.920 --> 37:13.480\n referring to a sea moth as a Pegasus species.\n\n37:13.480 --> 37:16.880\n And when you think about how amazing language is,\n\n37:16.880 --> 37:18.840\n and in some other context would say like,\n\n37:18.840 --> 37:21.320\n well, you need to have a world government\n\n37:21.320 --> 37:23.240\n and they're deciding which is the verbs\n\n37:23.240 --> 37:25.120\n and you have to have an official definition\n\n37:25.120 --> 37:26.720\n and an official dictionary.\n\n37:26.720 --> 37:28.120\n And none of that's happened.\n\n37:28.120 --> 37:30.520\n And I think anyone, even if they don't agree\n\n37:30.520 --> 37:32.840\n with my politics or my worldview,\n\n37:32.840 --> 37:35.800\n cannot deny that the creation of language\n\n37:35.800 --> 37:39.080\n is one of humanity's most miraculous,\n\n37:39.080 --> 37:40.760\n beautiful achievements.\n\n37:40.760 --> 37:41.600\n Absolutely.\n\n37:41.600 --> 37:42.440\n So there you go.\n\n37:42.440 --> 37:45.960\n There's one system where a kind of anarchy\n\n37:45.960 --> 37:49.560\n can result in beauty, stability,\n\n37:49.560 --> 37:50.920\n like sufficient stability,\n\n37:50.920 --> 37:55.680\n and yet, flexibility to adjust it and so on.\n\n37:55.680 --> 37:57.680\n And the internet helps it.\n\n37:57.680 --> 38:00.440\n You get something like Urban Dictionary,\n\n38:00.440 --> 38:05.120\n which starts creating absurd, both humor and wit.\n\n38:05.120 --> 38:07.360\n But also language and syntax and jargon,\n\n38:07.360 --> 38:09.240\n immediately you size people up.\n\n38:09.240 --> 38:12.080\n If you say vertebral, I know you're a doctor,\n\n38:12.080 --> 38:15.080\n because that's how they pronounce it, the spinal column.\n\n38:15.080 --> 38:17.200\n I'm sure in your field, there's certain jargon\n\n38:17.200 --> 38:18.840\n and right away you can know if this person's one of us\n\n38:18.840 --> 38:19.680\n or not.\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:20.840\n I mean, it's infinite.\n\n38:20.840 --> 38:22.280\n I mean, I don't need to tell you.\n\n38:22.280 --> 38:23.480\n It's emojis too.\n\n38:23.480 --> 38:25.640\n Yes, there's so much there to study with language.\n\n38:25.640 --> 38:26.480\n It's fascinating.\n\n38:26.480 --> 38:30.320\n But do you think this applies to human life?\n\n38:30.320 --> 38:32.160\n The meat space, the physical space?\n\n38:32.160 --> 38:33.000\n Yes.\n\n38:33.000 --> 38:35.480\n So that kind of beauty can emerge\n\n38:35.480 --> 38:40.040\n without writing stuff on paper, without laws.\n\n38:40.040 --> 38:40.880\n You could have rules.\n\n38:40.880 --> 38:43.280\n You don't need, they don't have to be laws.\n\n38:43.280 --> 38:44.120\n So.\n\n38:44.120 --> 38:45.680\n Enforced by violence.\n\n38:45.680 --> 38:48.160\n Like that's what, what's a law?\n\n38:48.160 --> 38:50.160\n A law is something that is unchosen.\n\n38:50.160 --> 38:51.000\n A rule is something.\n\n38:51.000 --> 38:52.920\n If I go to my pool, you know,\n\n38:52.920 --> 38:55.000\n I sign up to be a member of pool,\n\n38:55.000 --> 38:56.400\n on the wall there's certain things.\n\n38:56.400 --> 38:59.000\n It's like, you know, certain number of people in the pool.\n\n38:59.000 --> 39:00.080\n No peeing in here.\n\n39:00.080 --> 39:02.000\n Good luck enforcing that one.\n\n39:02.000 --> 39:03.080\n And so on and so forth.\n\n39:03.080 --> 39:04.080\n Well, that's the problem.\n\n39:04.080 --> 39:06.920\n Aren't you afraid that people are gonna pee in the pool?\n\n39:06.920 --> 39:10.920\n That's not as my big concern as mass incarceration,\n\n39:10.920 --> 39:13.240\n as the fact that the police can steal more money\n\n39:13.240 --> 39:14.480\n than burglars can.\n\n39:14.480 --> 39:16.560\n The fact that innocent people can be killed\n\n39:16.560 --> 39:18.240\n with no consequences.\n\n39:18.240 --> 39:20.320\n The fact that war can be waged\n\n39:20.320 --> 39:24.640\n and with no consequences for those who waged it.\n\n39:24.640 --> 39:27.000\n The fact that so many men and women are being murdered\n\n39:27.000 --> 39:28.360\n overseas and here,\n\n39:28.360 --> 39:31.120\n and the people who are guiding these are regarded as heroic.\n\n39:31.120 --> 39:32.040\n So you think there might,\n\n39:32.040 --> 39:34.480\n that in an anarchist system,\n\n39:34.480 --> 39:38.600\n there's a possibility of having less wars\n\n39:38.600 --> 39:41.240\n and less, what would you say, corruption\n\n39:42.400 --> 39:44.680\n and less abuse of power?\n\n39:44.680 --> 39:45.640\n Let's talk, yes.\n\n39:45.640 --> 39:47.080\n And let's talk about corruption\n\n39:47.080 --> 39:49.880\n because, and I made this point on Rogan,\n\n39:49.880 --> 39:51.960\n you and I, again, the Russian background,\n\n39:51.960 --> 39:55.160\n we realize that when it comes to corruption,\n\n39:55.160 --> 39:56.880\n American is very naive.\n\n39:56.880 --> 39:58.960\n Corruption they think is, oh, I got my brother a job\n\n39:58.960 --> 40:01.000\n and he's getting money on the table.\n\n40:01.000 --> 40:04.160\n That's not, when we're talking about like state corruption,\n\n40:04.160 --> 40:06.040\n things that are done in totalitarian states\n\n40:06.040 --> 40:07.280\n and even to some extent in America,\n\n40:07.280 --> 40:09.200\n like Jeffrey Epstein, Jillian Maxwell,\n\n40:09.200 --> 40:11.640\n things that Stalin did, things that Hitler did.\n\n40:11.640 --> 40:14.160\n When the CIA was torturing people at Gitmo,\n\n40:14.160 --> 40:16.320\n they had to borrow KGB manuals\n\n40:16.320 --> 40:17.720\n because they didn't know how to torture correctly\n\n40:17.720 --> 40:20.040\n because they never thought of these things.\n\n40:20.040 --> 40:23.320\n It's very hard for us to get into the mindset\n\n40:23.320 --> 40:25.720\n of someone who's like a child predator,\n\n40:25.720 --> 40:27.840\n someone who, let me give you an example\n\n40:27.840 --> 40:28.800\n from my forthcoming book.\n\n40:28.800 --> 40:31.840\n There was a guy who was the head of Ukraine in the 30s,\n\n40:31.840 --> 40:33.200\n I forget his name.\n\n40:33.200 --> 40:34.840\n Now these old Soviets, they were tough.\n\n40:34.840 --> 40:36.840\n I mean, they pride, Stalin means steel.\n\n40:36.840 --> 40:39.160\n They pride themselves and their cruelty\n\n40:39.160 --> 40:40.720\n and how strong they were.\n\n40:40.720 --> 40:42.080\n And this was the purge.\n\n40:42.080 --> 40:44.840\n Stalin is trying to, killing lots of people left and right\n\n40:44.840 --> 40:48.320\n and his henchman, Beria had the quote,\n\n40:48.320 --> 40:50.400\n find me the man and I'll find you the crime.\n\n40:50.400 --> 40:52.840\n They would accuse someone and they would torture him\n\n40:52.840 --> 40:54.640\n until he talked and confessed\n\n40:54.640 --> 40:56.480\n and then he had to turn people in.\n\n40:56.480 --> 40:59.200\n And they took this guy in like beginning of the year,\n\n40:59.200 --> 41:01.480\n I think it's 36, 38, he was head of Ukraine.\n\n41:01.480 --> 41:02.960\n By May, he's arrested.\n\n41:02.960 --> 41:04.680\n And they take him to the Ljubljanka, the basement\n\n41:04.680 --> 41:06.640\n in the red square where they're torturing people.\n\n41:06.640 --> 41:08.440\n And they did the works on him.\n\n41:08.440 --> 41:11.120\n And he was a good Soviet and he stood up.\n\n41:11.120 --> 41:12.400\n Who knows what they did to him?\n\n41:12.400 --> 41:13.560\n He didn't talk.\n\n41:13.560 --> 41:16.280\n So they said, okay, one moment.\n\n41:16.280 --> 41:18.200\n They brought his teenage daughter in,\n\n41:18.200 --> 41:20.680\n raped her in front of him, he talked.\n\n41:20.680 --> 41:23.180\n So when we talk about corruption,\n\n41:24.280 --> 41:26.920\n we would never in a million years think of this.\n\n41:26.920 --> 41:28.440\n That's not how our minds work.\n\n41:29.560 --> 41:31.960\n So when you're talking about states\n\n41:31.960 --> 41:35.760\n and people where you don't have ease of exit,\n\n41:35.760 --> 41:38.600\n where you are forced to be under the auspices\n\n41:38.600 --> 41:41.480\n of an organization creating a monopoly,\n\n41:41.480 --> 41:44.440\n that leads to in extreme cases,\n\n41:44.440 --> 41:49.040\n but in not as extreme cases, really nefarious outcomes.\n\n41:49.040 --> 41:53.000\n Whereas if you have the option to leave\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.880\n as a client or customer,\n\n41:54.880 --> 41:58.040\n that would have a strongly limiting effect\n\n41:58.040 --> 42:01.440\n on how a business and what it can get away with.\n\n42:01.440 --> 42:03.200\n But don't you think maybe,\n\n42:03.200 --> 42:04.640\n I don't know who the right example is,\n\n42:04.640 --> 42:05.720\n whether it's Stalin,\n\n42:05.720 --> 42:08.840\n I think Hitler might be the better example of,\n\n42:08.840 --> 42:12.720\n don't you think, or Jeffrey Epstein perhaps,\n\n42:12.720 --> 42:15.280\n don't you think people who are evil\n\n42:15.280 --> 42:20.280\n will find ways to manipulate human nature\n\n42:20.640 --> 42:23.720\n to attain power, no matter the system?\n\n42:23.720 --> 42:24.560\n Yes.\n\n42:24.560 --> 42:27.920\n And like the corollary question is,\n\n42:27.920 --> 42:31.800\n do you think those people can get more power\n\n42:31.800 --> 42:36.800\n in a democracy, when there's a government already in place?\n\n42:37.920 --> 42:39.800\n It's easily they get more power, more dangerous\n\n42:39.800 --> 42:40.760\n to have a government in place.\n\n42:40.760 --> 42:43.040\n First of all, sociopaths don't know for their charm\n\n42:43.040 --> 42:44.720\n and for their warmth.\n\n42:44.720 --> 42:46.180\n Here's the two situations.\n\n42:47.120 --> 42:51.000\n In a free society, I'm a sociopath, I'm an evil person,\n\n42:51.000 --> 42:52.160\n I'm the head of Macy's.\n\n42:53.040 --> 42:55.640\n In a state society, I'm an evil person, I'm a sociopath,\n\n42:55.640 --> 42:57.320\n I'm the head of the US government.\n\n42:57.320 --> 42:59.240\n Which of these are you more concerned with?\n\n42:59.240 --> 43:00.560\n It's like night and day.\n\n43:00.560 --> 43:03.320\n So you would have far more decentralized military,\n\n43:03.320 --> 43:08.320\n you would have far more decentralized security forces,\n\n43:08.460 --> 43:10.120\n and they would be much more subject\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:11.760\n to feedback from the market.\n\n43:11.760 --> 43:14.800\n If you have an issue with Macy's\n\n43:14.800 --> 43:18.320\n or any store with a sweater, look at that transaction.\n\n43:18.320 --> 43:20.880\n If you have an issue with the state,\n\n43:20.880 --> 43:22.880\n hiring a lawyer costs more than a surgeon.\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:25.640\n To even access the mechanism for dispute\n\n43:25.640 --> 43:27.740\n is going to be exorbitant and price poor people\n\n43:27.740 --> 43:30.980\n out of the market for conflict resolution immediately.\n\n43:30.980 --> 43:32.240\n So right away, you have something\n\n43:32.240 --> 43:34.640\n that's extremely regressive.\n\n43:34.640 --> 43:37.520\n And even though this is touted as some great equalizer,\n\n43:37.520 --> 43:38.780\n it's quite the opposite.\n\n43:38.780 --> 43:41.140\n So in current society, there's deep suspicion\n\n43:41.140 --> 43:43.260\n of governments and states.\n\n43:43.260 --> 43:44.800\n Not really.\n\n43:44.800 --> 43:46.640\n Like just your example of Macy's,\n\n43:46.640 --> 43:49.400\n I mean, don't you think a Hitler could rise\n\n43:49.400 --> 43:51.600\n to be at the top of a social network\n\n43:51.600 --> 43:53.180\n like Twitter and Facebook?\n\n43:53.180 --> 43:56.320\n Okay, let's suppose Hitler ran Twitter, okay?\n\n43:56.320 --> 43:58.440\n Let's take this thought experiment seriously.\n\n43:58.440 --> 43:59.760\n Literally what could he do?\n\n43:59.760 --> 44:01.240\n So the only tweets are gonna be\n\n44:01.240 --> 44:02.760\n about how much the Jews suck, right?\n\n44:02.760 --> 44:04.400\n Okay, fine.\n\n44:04.400 --> 44:07.040\n Okay, all the cool people are leaving.\n\n44:07.040 --> 44:09.560\n There could be some compelling,\n\n44:09.560 --> 44:12.920\n like you said, evil people are charming.\n\n44:12.920 --> 44:14.620\n There could be some compelling narratives\n\n44:14.620 --> 44:18.920\n that could be with conspiracy theories, untruths,\n\n44:18.920 --> 44:22.340\n that could be spread like propaganda.\n\n44:22.340 --> 44:25.560\n Every criticism of anarchism is in fact a description.\n\n44:25.560 --> 44:27.460\n Well, the strongest criticism of anarchism\n\n44:27.460 --> 44:29.400\n are in fact descriptions of status quo.\n\n44:29.400 --> 44:34.160\n Your concern is, under anarchism, propaganda would spread\n\n44:34.160 --> 44:36.080\n and people would be taught the wrong ideas,\n\n44:36.080 --> 44:37.680\n unlike the status quo?\n\n44:37.680 --> 44:39.960\n That's not even a criticism of anarchism.\n\n44:39.960 --> 44:41.560\n I'm not actually criticizing.\n\n44:41.560 --> 44:43.640\n It's an open question of,\n\n44:45.720 --> 44:48.360\n it's an open question of in which system\n\n44:48.360 --> 44:53.360\n will human nature be able to thrive more\n\n44:54.280 --> 44:57.480\n and in which system would the evils\n\n44:57.480 --> 44:59.240\n that arise in human nature\n\n44:59.240 --> 45:02.000\n would be more easily suppressible?\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.320\n That's the open question.\n\n45:03.320 --> 45:05.000\n It's a scientific experiment\n\n45:05.000 --> 45:07.280\n and I'm asking only from my perspective\n\n45:07.280 --> 45:10.400\n of the fact that we've tried democracy\n\n45:10.400 --> 45:14.280\n quite a bit recently and maybe you can correct me,\n\n45:14.280 --> 45:18.000\n we haven't yet seriously tried anarchy on a large scale.\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:19.680\n Well, we don't need to try to,\n\n45:19.680 --> 45:21.520\n so anarchy isn't like a country, right?\n\n45:21.520 --> 45:25.320\n It's like saying, well, if anarchy works,\n\n45:25.320 --> 45:27.280\n how come we've never had an anarchist government, right?\n\n45:27.280 --> 45:29.620\n So anarchism is a relationship\n\n45:29.620 --> 45:31.140\n and language is an example of this.\n\n45:31.140 --> 45:32.720\n It's a worldwide anarchic system.\n\n45:32.720 --> 45:34.000\n You and I have an anarchist relationship.\n\n45:34.000 --> 45:35.400\n There's almost no circumstances\n\n45:35.400 --> 45:37.720\n that we'd be calling the police on each other.\n\n45:37.720 --> 45:39.880\n I mean, I'm asking the same question\n\n45:39.880 --> 45:41.720\n in a bunch of different directions\n\n45:41.720 --> 45:44.360\n out of, born out of my curiosity,\n\n45:44.360 --> 45:49.280\n is why is anarchy going to be better\n\n45:49.280 --> 45:52.000\n at preventing the darker sides of human nature,\n\n45:52.000 --> 45:54.720\n which presumably your criticism of government.\n\n45:54.720 --> 45:56.820\n Because of decentralization.\n\n45:56.820 --> 46:00.160\n So the darker side of human nature is an extreme concern.\n\n46:00.160 --> 46:01.800\n Anyone who says it's gonna go away\n\n46:01.800 --> 46:04.120\n is absurd and fallacious.\n\n46:04.120 --> 46:05.260\n I think that's a nonstarter\n\n46:05.260 --> 46:07.220\n when people say that everyone's gonna be good.\n\n46:07.220 --> 46:08.660\n Human beings are basically animals.\n\n46:08.660 --> 46:10.840\n We're capable of great beauty and kindness.\n\n46:10.840 --> 46:13.660\n We're capable of just complete cruel\n\n46:13.660 --> 46:15.320\n and what we would call inhumanity,\n\n46:15.320 --> 46:17.920\n but we see it on a daily basis even today.\n\n46:17.920 --> 46:21.340\n And what's interesting is the corporate press\n\n46:21.340 --> 46:23.680\n won't even tell you the darkest aspects\n\n46:23.680 --> 46:25.320\n because that's too upsetting to people.\n\n46:25.320 --> 46:27.700\n So they'll tell you about atrocities and horrors,\n\n46:27.700 --> 46:29.320\n but only to a point.\n\n46:29.320 --> 46:31.020\n And then when you actually do the homework,\n\n46:31.020 --> 46:32.600\n you're like, oh, it's so much worse than,\n\n46:32.600 --> 46:34.120\n like that thing about Stalin, right?\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:38.040\n So we know in a broad sense that Stalin was a dictator.\n\n46:38.040 --> 46:41.080\n We know that he killed a lot of people,\n\n46:41.080 --> 46:44.040\n but it takes work to learn about the Holodomor.\n\n46:44.040 --> 46:45.540\n It takes work to learn about\n\n46:45.540 --> 46:47.640\n what those literal tortures were\n\n46:47.640 --> 46:49.680\n and that this is the person who later,\n\n46:49.680 --> 46:52.320\n FDR and Harry Truman were shaking hands with\n\n46:52.320 --> 46:53.360\n and taking photos with\n\n46:53.360 --> 46:55.600\n and was being sold to us as Uncle Joe.\n\n46:55.600 --> 46:56.960\n He's just like you and me.\n\n46:57.820 --> 47:02.820\n So when you have a decentralized information network\n\n47:03.260 --> 47:06.040\n as opposed to having three media networks,\n\n47:06.040 --> 47:08.560\n it is a lot easier for information\n\n47:08.560 --> 47:09.900\n that doesn't fit what would be\n\n47:09.900 --> 47:13.840\n the corporate America narrative to reach the populations.\n\n47:13.840 --> 47:16.380\n And it would be more effective for democracy\n\n47:16.380 --> 47:18.400\n because they're in a much better position to be informed.\n\n47:18.400 --> 47:20.220\n Now, you're right.\n\n47:20.220 --> 47:22.260\n It also means, well, if everyone has a mic,\n\n47:22.260 --> 47:25.560\n that means every crazy person and with their wacky views.\n\n47:25.560 --> 47:28.480\n And at a certain point, yeah, it has to become,\n\n47:28.480 --> 47:29.660\n then there's another level,\n\n47:29.660 --> 47:32.120\n which is then the people have to be self enforcing.\n\n47:32.120 --> 47:34.040\n And you see that in social media all the time\n\n47:34.040 --> 47:37.240\n where someone says this, the other person jumps in.\n\n47:37.240 --> 47:40.600\n You think, but isn't social media a good example of this?\n\n47:40.600 --> 47:44.960\n So you think ultimately without centralized control,\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:47.220\n you can have stability?\n\n47:48.720 --> 47:52.280\n What about the mob outrage and the mob rule,\n\n47:52.280 --> 47:54.800\n the power of the mobs that emerge?\n\n47:54.800 --> 47:58.720\n Power of the mob is a very serious concern.\n\n47:58.720 --> 48:01.480\n Gustav Le Bon wrote a book in the 1890s called The Crowd.\n\n48:01.480 --> 48:03.440\n And this was one of the most important books I've written\n\n48:03.440 --> 48:05.960\n because it influenced both Mussolini and Hitler and Stalin\n\n48:05.960 --> 48:07.360\n and they all talked about it.\n\n48:07.360 --> 48:11.040\n And he made the point that under crowd psychology,\n\n48:11.040 --> 48:13.480\n human lynching is another example of this.\n\n48:13.480 --> 48:16.100\n None of those individuals or very few\n\n48:16.100 --> 48:19.520\n would ever dream of doing these acts.\n\n48:19.520 --> 48:21.160\n But when they're all together\n\n48:21.160 --> 48:23.680\n and you lose that sense of self, you become the ant\n\n48:23.680 --> 48:25.740\n and you lose that sense of individually,\n\n48:25.740 --> 48:29.120\n you're capable of doing things that like in another context,\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:32.280\n you'd be like, I should kill myself, I'm a monster.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:36.160\n So you're worried about that, but doesn't the mob have more\n\n48:36.160 --> 48:37.560\n power under anarchy?\n\n48:37.560 --> 48:39.840\n No, the mob has much less power in anarchy\n\n48:39.840 --> 48:41.880\n because under anarchism, every individual\n\n48:41.880 --> 48:43.360\n is fully empowered.\n\n48:43.360 --> 48:47.960\n You wouldn't have gun restrictions.\n\n48:47.960 --> 48:50.040\n You would have people creating communities\n\n48:50.040 --> 48:51.820\n based on shared values.\n\n48:51.820 --> 48:55.000\n They'd be much more collegial, they'd be much more kind,\n\n48:55.000 --> 48:57.520\n as opposed to when you're forcing people\n\n48:57.520 --> 48:59.400\n to be together in a polity\n\n48:59.400 --> 49:01.360\n when they don't have things in common.\n\n49:01.360 --> 49:03.720\n That is like having a bad roommate.\n\n49:03.720 --> 49:06.120\n If you're forced to look like jails,\n\n49:06.120 --> 49:09.920\n if you're forced to be locked in a room with someone,\n\n49:09.920 --> 49:11.480\n even if you had first liked them,\n\n49:11.480 --> 49:13.480\n after a while, you're going to start to hate them\n\n49:13.480 --> 49:16.800\n and that leads to very nefarious consequences.\n\n49:16.800 --> 49:21.160\n So as an anarchist, what do you do in a society like this?\n\n49:21.160 --> 49:22.720\n Thrive.\n\n49:22.720 --> 49:24.720\n I think I'm doing okay.\n\n49:24.720 --> 49:29.720\n No, I mean, there's an election coming up.\n\n49:29.720 --> 49:34.720\n There's, as you talk, You're Welcome\n\n49:36.080 --> 49:40.080\n is one of the 15 shows that you host.\n\n49:40.080 --> 49:44.120\n It's down to one.\n\n49:44.120 --> 49:46.020\n Okay, it's down to one.\n\n49:46.020 --> 49:47.320\n But I'm a big fan.\n\n49:49.440 --> 49:52.440\n You talk about libertarianism a little bit.\n\n49:52.440 --> 49:57.440\n I mean, is there some practical political direction\n\n49:57.440 --> 50:01.160\n in terms of we as a society should go?\n\n50:01.160 --> 50:03.000\n I don't mean we as a nation.\n\n50:03.000 --> 50:04.640\n I mean, we as a collective of people\n\n50:04.640 --> 50:07.520\n should go to make a better world\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:09.200\n from an anarchist point of view.\n\n50:09.200 --> 50:13.680\n Sure, I think politics is the enemy and anything.\n\n50:13.680 --> 50:14.680\n How do you define politics?\n\n50:14.680 --> 50:16.340\n The state, the government.\n\n50:16.340 --> 50:19.960\n So anything that lessens its sway on people,\n\n50:19.960 --> 50:23.440\n anything that delegitimizes it is good.\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:25.400\n I wrote an article a few years ago\n\n50:25.400 --> 50:27.620\n about how wonderful it is that Trump\n\n50:27.620 --> 50:29.900\n is regarded as such a buffoon\n\n50:29.900 --> 50:32.080\n because it's very, very useful\n\n50:32.080 --> 50:35.160\n to have a commander in chief who's regarded as a clown\n\n50:35.160 --> 50:37.280\n because it's gonna take a lot\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:39.920\n to get him to convince your kids to go overseas\n\n50:39.920 --> 50:42.320\n and start killing people and making widows and orphans,\n\n50:42.320 --> 50:44.440\n as well as those kids coming home in caskets.\n\n50:44.440 --> 50:47.200\n Whereas if someone is regarded with prestige\n\n50:47.200 --> 50:49.680\n and they're like, oh, we need to send your kid overseas.\n\n50:49.680 --> 50:50.920\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n50:50.920 --> 50:52.340\n I mean, this guy's great.\n\n50:52.340 --> 50:54.440\n So that is a very healthy thing\n\n50:54.440 --> 50:57.120\n where people are skeptical of the state.\n\n50:57.120 --> 51:01.080\n But there's a lot of people that regard him\n\n51:01.080 --> 51:04.640\n as one of the greatest leaders we've ever had.\n\n51:04.640 --> 51:07.200\n Yeah, Dinesh D'Souza, he's another Lincoln.\n\n51:08.560 --> 51:10.440\n When you talk shit about Trump\n\n51:10.440 --> 51:12.560\n or talk shit about Biden,\n\n51:14.840 --> 51:16.840\n I'm trying to find a line to walk\n\n51:16.840 --> 51:19.720\n where they don't immediately put you into\n\n51:19.720 --> 51:21.600\n this person has Trump derangement syndrome\n\n51:21.600 --> 51:25.240\n or they have the alternative to that.\n\n51:25.240 --> 51:27.100\n I'm more than happy\n\n51:27.100 --> 51:29.480\n when people are preemptively dismissing me\n\n51:29.480 --> 51:31.600\n because then I don't have to waste time engaging with them\n\n51:31.600 --> 51:33.640\n because those people would be of no use to me.\n\n51:33.640 --> 51:36.540\n When I was on Tim Pool recently, Tim Pool's show,\n\n51:36.540 --> 51:38.740\n Tim Pool's known for his little hat.\n\n51:38.740 --> 51:40.520\n I got a propeller beanie motorized\n\n51:40.520 --> 51:42.560\n and it was just spinning the whole two hours.\n\n51:42.560 --> 51:44.280\n I know, like a 1950s thing.\n\n51:44.280 --> 51:47.480\n The point being I wore it because there's lots of people\n\n51:47.480 --> 51:50.080\n who would say, I can't take seriously someone\n\n51:50.080 --> 51:51.400\n who wears a hat like that.\n\n51:51.400 --> 51:53.640\n And my point being, if you are the kind of person\n\n51:53.640 --> 51:56.680\n who takes your cues based on someone's wardrobe\n\n51:56.680 --> 51:58.560\n as opposed to the content of your ideas,\n\n51:58.560 --> 52:01.200\n you're of no use to me as an ally.\n\n52:01.200 --> 52:04.600\n So I'd be more than happy you preemptively abort\n\n52:04.600 --> 52:07.220\n rather than waste our breath trying to engage.\n\n52:07.220 --> 52:10.200\n This is a very, very deep thing that you and I disagree on,\n\n52:10.200 --> 52:13.440\n which is, this goes to the trolling versus the love,\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:19.040\n is I believe that person instinctually dismisses you\n\n52:19.040 --> 52:21.320\n on the very basic surface level.\n\n52:21.320 --> 52:26.320\n But deep down, there's a wealth of a human being\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:32.320\n that seeks the connection, seeks to understand deeply\n\n52:32.320 --> 52:36.000\n to connect with other humans that we should speak to.\n\n52:36.000 --> 52:38.200\n Yeah, you and I completely disagree.\n\n52:38.200 --> 52:40.040\n See, you're saying.\n\n52:40.040 --> 52:42.400\n I'm saying there's no mind there literally.\n\n52:42.400 --> 52:47.400\n Okay, so I naturally think the majority of people\n\n52:47.400 --> 52:52.400\n have the capacity to be thoughtful, intelligent,\n\n52:55.440 --> 53:00.440\n and learn about ideas, ideas that they instinctually\n\n53:01.960 --> 53:06.960\n based on their own current inner circle disagree with\n\n53:07.200 --> 53:10.160\n and learn to understand, to empathize with the other.\n\n53:10.160 --> 53:13.480\n And in the current climate,\n\n53:13.480 --> 53:15.680\n there's a divisiveness that discourages that.\n\n53:15.680 --> 53:20.680\n And that's where I see the value of love of encouraging\n\n53:20.680 --> 53:25.680\n people to strip away that surface instinctual response\n\n53:27.280 --> 53:29.480\n based on the thing they've been taught,\n\n53:29.480 --> 53:31.120\n based on the things they listen to,\n\n53:31.120 --> 53:32.560\n to actually think deeply.\n\n53:32.560 --> 53:36.880\n Have you ever had gone to CVS or Duane Reade\n\n53:36.880 --> 53:40.240\n and your bill, how much you owe them is $6,\n\n53:40.240 --> 53:42.240\n and you give them a $10 bill in a single\n\n53:42.240 --> 53:44.520\n and watch the look on their face?\n\n53:44.520 --> 53:46.760\n You watch them void their bowels and panic\n\n53:46.760 --> 53:49.600\n because you've given them $11 on a $6 bill.\n\n53:49.600 --> 53:52.560\n This is not a mind capable or interested\n\n53:52.560 --> 53:54.280\n in thoughts and ideas and learning.\n\n53:54.280 --> 53:57.000\n No, you're talking about the first moment\n\n53:57.000 --> 54:02.000\n of a first moment where there's an opportunity to think.\n\n54:02.440 --> 54:04.160\n They are desperate to avoid it.\n\n54:05.640 --> 54:07.080\n No, they're just, it's.\n\n54:07.080 --> 54:08.720\n And incapable of it.\n\n54:08.720 --> 54:12.480\n I just, they have the same exact experiences\n\n54:12.480 --> 54:15.120\n I have every single day when I know it's time\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:18.040\n for me to go out on a run of five miles\n\n54:18.040 --> 54:20.320\n or six miles or 10 miles.\n\n54:20.320 --> 54:24.320\n I'm desperate to avoid it, and at the same time,\n\n54:24.320 --> 54:26.520\n I know I have the capacity to do it,\n\n54:26.520 --> 54:28.960\n and I'm deeply fulfilled when I do do it,\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:30.360\n when I do overcome that challenge.\n\n54:30.360 --> 54:33.200\n You are one of the great minds of our generation.\n\n54:33.200 --> 54:35.080\n You are telling me that any of these people\n\n54:35.080 --> 54:38.200\n can do anything close to the work you do?\n\n54:38.200 --> 54:39.800\n Not in artificial intelligence,\n\n54:39.800 --> 54:44.800\n but in the ability to be compassionate\n\n54:45.280 --> 54:48.320\n towards other people's ideas,\n\n54:48.320 --> 54:50.440\n like understand them enough to be able.\n\n54:50.440 --> 54:53.360\n Passion requires a certain baseline of intelligence,\n\n54:53.360 --> 54:54.680\n because you have to perceive other people\n\n54:54.680 --> 54:56.040\n as being different but of value.\n\n54:56.040 --> 54:56.880\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n54:56.880 --> 54:59.520\n That's a sophisticated mindset.\n\n54:59.520 --> 55:03.240\n I think most people are capable of it.\n\n55:03.240 --> 55:04.080\n You don't think so?\n\n55:04.080 --> 55:06.720\n No, and nor are they interested in it.\n\n55:06.720 --> 55:08.920\n But in that kind of,\n\n55:08.920 --> 55:11.760\n if you don't believe they're capable of it,\n\n55:11.760 --> 55:14.040\n how can anarchy be stable?\n\n55:15.040 --> 55:18.200\n If you have a farm, there's one farmer and 50 cows,\n\n55:18.200 --> 55:19.480\n it's very stable.\n\n55:19.480 --> 55:21.480\n You're just not, you're not asking the cows\n\n55:21.480 --> 55:23.560\n where to farm things.\n\n55:25.240 --> 55:29.560\n Yeah, but the cows aren't intelligent enough to do damage.\n\n55:29.560 --> 55:31.520\n Cows certainly, bulls,\n\n55:31.520 --> 55:32.400\n because they could do a lot of damage.\n\n55:32.400 --> 55:34.800\n They could trample things, they could attack you.\n\n55:34.800 --> 55:36.960\n Cows are like, how much do they weigh, like 4,000 pounds?\n\n55:36.960 --> 55:38.480\n Can you connect the analogy then?\n\n55:38.480 --> 55:39.320\n Because like.\n\n55:39.320 --> 55:41.120\n Sure, you can't expect that.\n\n55:41.120 --> 55:41.960\n Yeah.\n\n55:41.960 --> 55:44.640\n Saying a cow is a cow isn't a slur.\n\n55:44.640 --> 55:46.000\n It's not saying you hate cows.\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:47.640\n Cows, or even, let's say,\n\n55:47.640 --> 55:50.520\n the example I always use with good reason is dogs, okay?\n\n55:51.440 --> 55:53.680\n I always say to study how human beings operate,\n\n55:53.680 --> 55:55.120\n watch Cesar Millan,\n\n55:55.120 --> 55:57.080\n because human beings and dogs have co evolved.\n\n55:57.080 --> 55:59.480\n Our minds have both evolved in parallel tracks\n\n55:59.480 --> 56:00.880\n to communicate with each other.\n\n56:00.880 --> 56:03.520\n Dogs are, can be vicious.\n\n56:03.520 --> 56:06.320\n Dogs for the most part are great, wonderful,\n\n56:06.320 --> 56:08.760\n but you can't expect the dog\n\n56:08.760 --> 56:11.280\n to understand certain concepts.\n\n56:11.280 --> 56:13.040\n It's not an, and now most people are offended.\n\n56:13.040 --> 56:14.160\n Are you saying I'm like a dog?\n\n56:14.160 --> 56:15.880\n If you're a dog person like I am,\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:17.080\n this is actually a huge compliment.\n\n56:17.080 --> 56:19.800\n Most dogs are better than most people,\n\n56:19.800 --> 56:22.960\n but to get the idea that this is something\n\n56:22.960 --> 56:26.640\n that is basically your peer is nonsensical.\n\n56:26.640 --> 56:28.400\n Now, of course this sounds arrogant and elitist\n\n56:28.400 --> 56:29.560\n and so on and so forth,\n\n56:29.560 --> 56:31.320\n and I'm perfectly happy with that,\n\n56:31.320 --> 56:34.480\n but it is very hard to persuade me or anyone\n\n56:34.480 --> 56:36.480\n that if you walk, George Carlin has that joke,\n\n56:36.480 --> 56:37.960\n think how smart the average person is,\n\n56:37.960 --> 56:40.400\n then realize 50% of people are dumber than that.\n\n56:40.400 --> 56:42.200\n If you walk around and see who's out there,\n\n56:42.200 --> 56:43.800\n these people are very kind.\n\n56:43.800 --> 56:45.080\n They are of value.\n\n56:45.080 --> 56:47.800\n They deserve to be treated with respect.\n\n56:47.800 --> 56:49.880\n They deserve to be secure in their person.\n\n56:49.880 --> 56:52.840\n They deserve to feel safe and to have love,\n\n56:52.840 --> 56:56.360\n but the expectation that they should have\n\n56:56.360 --> 56:59.240\n any sort of semblance of power over me or my life\n\n56:59.240 --> 57:03.120\n is as nonsensical as asking Lassie to be my accountant.\n\n57:03.120 --> 57:05.960\n So, but that goes to power,\n\n57:05.960 --> 57:09.880\n that not to the ability, the capacity\n\n57:09.880 --> 57:12.880\n to be empathetic, compassionate, intelligent.\n\n57:12.880 --> 57:16.160\n What, if I were to try to prove you wrong?\n\n57:16.160 --> 57:17.880\n That's a good question, okay.\n\n57:17.880 --> 57:22.220\n What would you be impressed by about society?\n\n57:24.080 --> 57:25.720\n How would I show it to you?\n\n57:25.720 --> 57:26.560\n That's a good question.\n\n57:26.560 --> 57:27.400\n How would you show it to me?\n\n57:27.400 --> 57:28.960\n Because I think something has to be falsifiable\n\n57:28.960 --> 57:30.680\n if you're gonna make a claim, right?\n\n57:30.680 --> 57:33.960\n So what would it?\n\n57:33.960 --> 57:35.400\n Because we both made claims\n\n57:35.400 --> 57:39.040\n that aren't a kind of our own like interpretation\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:40.760\n based on our interaction.\n\n57:40.760 --> 57:43.640\n Like when I opened Twitter, everyone seems to say.\n\n57:43.640 --> 57:44.800\n Why do you only follow one person?\n\n57:44.800 --> 57:45.640\n Who do you follow?\n\n57:45.640 --> 57:46.800\n Who's the one person you follow?\n\n57:46.800 --> 57:48.040\n Stoic Emperor.\n\n57:48.040 --> 57:49.640\n I follow a lot of people.\n\n57:49.640 --> 57:50.640\n I have a script.\n\n57:50.640 --> 57:55.640\n I have a script that I have an entire interface.\n\n57:55.880 --> 57:58.760\n So I think Twitter is really.\n\n57:58.760 --> 57:59.760\n This is real love.\n\n57:59.760 --> 58:00.920\n It's not ironic love.\n\n58:00.920 --> 58:04.200\n I love watching it and I'm sure you do too.\n\n58:04.200 --> 58:06.360\n I love watching a quality mind at work\n\n58:06.360 --> 58:08.260\n because when someone has a quality mind,\n\n58:08.260 --> 58:10.360\n they're often not self aware.\n\n58:10.360 --> 58:12.780\n I catch this on myself of how it operates\n\n58:12.780 --> 58:13.920\n and then when other people see it,\n\n58:13.920 --> 58:15.440\n they're like, oh my God, this is so beautiful\n\n58:15.440 --> 58:17.340\n because there's such an innocence to it.\n\n58:17.340 --> 58:21.760\n But like when I opened Twitter, I'm energized.\n\n58:21.760 --> 58:23.160\n There's a lot of love on Twitter.\n\n58:23.160 --> 58:24.080\n People say like.\n\n58:24.080 --> 58:24.920\n I love Twitter.\n\n58:24.920 --> 58:25.740\n I agree.\n\n58:25.740 --> 58:27.060\n You don't think I have a lot of love on Twitter?\n\n58:27.060 --> 58:29.000\n My fans pay my rent.\n\n58:29.000 --> 58:32.400\n I mean, I don't know your experience of Twitter,\n\n58:32.400 --> 58:33.440\n but when I look at your,\n\n58:33.440 --> 58:35.560\n which is a fundamentally different thing.\n\n58:35.560 --> 58:37.560\n I'm saying my experience from the.\n\n58:37.560 --> 58:39.320\n So maybe you can tell me what your experience\n\n58:39.320 --> 58:40.360\n is like as a human.\n\n58:40.360 --> 58:43.040\n So when I observe your Twitter,\n\n58:43.040 --> 58:48.040\n I think, I wouldn't call it love.\n\n58:48.040 --> 58:50.440\n I would call it fun.\n\n58:50.440 --> 58:51.280\n Yes.\n\n58:51.280 --> 58:54.680\n And because of that, that's a different kind of,\n\n58:54.680 --> 58:56.840\n that like love emerges from that\n\n58:56.840 --> 59:00.500\n because people kind of learn that we're having,\n\n59:00.500 --> 59:02.360\n this is like game night, like.\n\n59:02.360 --> 59:03.780\n Yes.\n\n59:03.780 --> 59:06.320\n You know, we can talk shit a little bit.\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:10.400\n We can, and you can even like pull in,\n\n59:10.400 --> 59:11.600\n you can make fun of people.\n\n59:11.600 --> 59:13.760\n You can have the crazy uncle come over\n\n59:13.760 --> 59:16.720\n that is a huge Trump supporter,\n\n59:16.720 --> 59:19.480\n somebody who hates Trump and you can have a little fun.\n\n59:19.480 --> 59:20.320\n I get it.\n\n59:20.320 --> 59:21.140\n It's a different kind of thing.\n\n59:21.140 --> 59:25.340\n I wouldn't be able to be the,\n\n59:25.340 --> 59:26.840\n you're the host of game night.\n\n59:26.840 --> 59:27.680\n Yes, yes.\n\n59:27.680 --> 59:30.240\n So I wouldn't be able to host that kind of game night.\n\n59:30.240 --> 59:32.840\n I imagine you programming your robots\n\n59:32.840 --> 59:34.300\n and you're asking what is fun\n\n59:34.300 --> 59:35.640\n and it just starts sparking.\n\n59:35.640 --> 59:37.300\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n59:37.300 --> 59:38.140\n Yeah.\n\n59:38.140 --> 59:38.960\n What is fun?\n\n59:38.960 --> 59:42.480\n So the robots in my life that survive\n\n59:42.480 --> 59:45.680\n are the ones that don't,\n\n59:45.680 --> 59:49.820\n that like survive that whole programming process.\n\n59:49.820 --> 59:51.140\n So they're kind of like,\n\n59:51.140 --> 59:52.880\n they're kind of like the idiot from Dostoevsky,\n\n59:52.880 --> 59:55.780\n they're very like simple minded robots.\n\n59:56.880 --> 1:00:00.320\n Fun is moving a can from one table to another.\n\n1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:03.440\n That's game night for our kin.\n\n1:00:03.440 --> 1:00:04.720\n You know, one of my quotes is,\n\n1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:06.440\n and I think about this every day\n\n1:00:06.440 --> 1:00:09.180\n and I mean it with every fiber of my being,\n\n1:00:09.180 --> 1:00:11.520\n we're born knowing that life is a magical adventure\n\n1:00:11.520 --> 1:00:14.780\n and it takes them years to train us to think otherwise.\n\n1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:16.560\n And I think that Willy Wonka approach,\n\n1:00:16.560 --> 1:00:17.800\n it's a very Camus approach.\n\n1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:20.660\n It's something I believe with every fiber of my being.\n\n1:00:20.660 --> 1:00:22.780\n I try to spread that as much as possible.\n\n1:00:22.780 --> 1:00:24.600\n I think it is very sad.\n\n1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:25.720\n I'm not being sarcastic.\n\n1:00:25.720 --> 1:00:27.520\n It comes off as condescending.\n\n1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:29.000\n I mean it at face value.\n\n1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.760\n It's very sad how many people are not receptive to that.\n\n1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:32.880\n And I think a lot of those functions,\n\n1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:34.060\n how they were raised.\n\n1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:37.040\n And I could have very easily with my upbringing\n\n1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:40.360\n have not maintained that perspective.\n\n1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.720\n And there's a lot of,\n\n1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:45.180\n I have a lot of friends in recovery like AA\n\n1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:47.000\n and they have an expression,\n\n1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.200\n not my circus, not my monkeys, right?\n\n1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:51.920\n That you can't really take on other people's problems\n\n1:00:51.920 --> 1:00:53.120\n on your own at a certain point,\n\n1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:54.560\n they have to do the work themselves\n\n1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:56.840\n because you can only do so much externally.\n\n1:00:56.840 --> 1:01:00.560\n And there are a lot of very damaged people out there.\n\n1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:04.440\n And they're damaged people who revel in being damaged.\n\n1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.000\n And they are damaged people who desperately,\n\n1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.960\n desperately, desperately wanna be well,\n\n1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:10.280\n who desperately wanna be happy,\n\n1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:12.180\n who desperately wanna find joy.\n\n1:01:12.180 --> 1:01:15.840\n So if I can be the one and as arrogant as this sounds,\n\n1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:18.400\n I'll own it, who does give them that fun\n\n1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:21.120\n and to tell them it doesn't have to be like you thought.\n\n1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:24.140\n Like it could be, it's gonna hurt, it's gonna suck,\n\n1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:25.820\n but it's still a magical adventure\n\n1:01:25.820 --> 1:01:26.800\n and you're gonna be okay,\n\n1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.080\n cause you've been through worse.\n\n1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:30.040\n Like that, if that could be my message,\n\n1:01:30.040 --> 1:01:32.020\n I would own it all day long.\n\n1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:35.560\n And so what does adventure look like for you?\n\n1:01:35.560 --> 1:01:37.240\n Cause I mean, it actually boils down to,\n\n1:01:37.240 --> 1:01:38.620\n I still disagree with you.\n\n1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:41.880\n I think trolling can be\n\n1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:45.020\n and very often is destructive for society.\n\n1:01:45.020 --> 1:01:46.720\n Yes, I want to destroy society.\n\n1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:47.600\n That is the goal.\n\n1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:50.600\n I want to help many people.\n\n1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:51.800\n Unironically, okay.\n\n1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:52.880\n Unironically, yes.\n\n1:01:54.760 --> 1:01:55.840\n What do I do with that?\n\n1:01:55.840 --> 1:01:56.680\n Okay, so.\n\n1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:57.500\n Whatever you want.\n\n1:01:57.500 --> 1:02:00.200\n Do what thou wilt is the hall of the law.\n\n1:02:00.200 --> 1:02:01.120\n Like I just wanna,\n\n1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:02.440\n so you're hosting game night\n\n1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:04.140\n and I just wanna play Monopoly.\n\n1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:07.560\n I wanna play, what's it, Risk.\n\n1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:08.920\n Okay, I wanna play these games.\n\n1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.560\n And you're saying. Those are aggressive games.\n\n1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:12.840\n Yeah, I was trying to think like of a friendlier game,\n\n1:02:12.840 --> 1:02:14.640\n but they're all kind of aggressive.\n\n1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:16.440\n Battleship.\n\n1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:19.680\n Axis and allies, you know, fun stuff.\n\n1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:24.220\n But like, so that's an adventure,\n\n1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:27.760\n but you're saying that we want to destroy everything.\n\n1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:31.600\n Even like the rules of those games are not.\n\n1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.480\n You voluntarily agree to those rules.\n\n1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:35.200\n The point is if someone comes in\n\n1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.420\n who no one invited to game night\n\n1:02:37.420 --> 1:02:40.080\n and are telling you, no, when you play Monopoly,\n\n1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:42.720\n you have to get money when you land in free parking\n\n1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:45.320\n or you don't, it's like, who are you?\n\n1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:47.520\n We're having our own fun and you smell.\n\n1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:52.960\n I don't know, but there's an aggressive.\n\n1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:53.960\n There's an aggression.\n\n1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:56.460\n Let me speak to that, which I think you're picking up on.\n\n1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:58.440\n I had a friend named Martha, Marcia, excuse me.\n\n1:02:58.440 --> 1:02:59.720\n She ran something called cuddle parties,\n\n1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:02.000\n which people laughed at about a lot back in the day.\n\n1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:03.260\n And the premise of the cuddle parties,\n\n1:03:03.260 --> 1:03:04.760\n everyone got together and cuddled, right?\n\n1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:05.680\n And it's like, ah, ha, ha.\n\n1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:06.720\n Then you stop to think about it\n\n1:03:06.720 --> 1:03:09.620\n and you realize physical contact is extremely important.\n\n1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:11.000\n And a lot of people don't have it.\n\n1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.720\n And if this is a mechanism of people getting that,\n\n1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:13.560\n it actually is going to have\n\n1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:15.400\n profound positive psychological consequences.\n\n1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.320\n So after she explained it, I'm like, okay,\n\n1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:18.600\n we laughed at this because it's weird.\n\n1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:20.560\n And now that I think about it, this is wonderful.\n\n1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:23.560\n And I asked her about like the tough question,\n\n1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.800\n I go, what if guys get turned on?\n\n1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:27.640\n And on their website, it even has a rule,\n\n1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:28.840\n like do not fear the erection, right?\n\n1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:30.200\n Because it's going to be a natural consequence\n\n1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:31.400\n of physical proximity.\n\n1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:33.000\n And the point she goes, she said this,\n\n1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.520\n I think about this all the time.\n\n1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:38.560\n People will take as much space as you let them.\n\n1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:42.840\n It is incumbent on each of us to set our own boundaries.\n\n1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:44.400\n We all have to learn when to say,\n\n1:03:44.400 --> 1:03:46.240\n no, you're making me uncomfortable.\n\n1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:48.460\n If someone doesn't respect your right\n\n1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:50.180\n to have your boundary to be uncomfortable,\n\n1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:51.800\n this person is not your friend.\n\n1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.300\n Now they can say, I don't understand.\n\n1:03:54.300 --> 1:03:55.460\n Like, why is this okay?\n\n1:03:55.460 --> 1:03:56.360\n Why is that not?\n\n1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:59.280\n Let me know you better so I'm respectful of you.\n\n1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:01.020\n But if they roll their eyes and they're like,\n\n1:04:01.020 --> 1:04:02.320\n get over, I'm going to do what I want,\n\n1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:05.320\n this person is not interested in knowing you as a human being.\n\n1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.000\n Okay.\n\n1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:08.820\n And that is the aggression.\n\n1:04:08.820 --> 1:04:10.180\n You have to draw those lines.\n\n1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:13.440\n I mean, but that's a very positive way\n\n1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.880\n of phrasing that aggression.\n\n1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.000\n I'm a very positive person.\n\n1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:20.040\n But the trolling, there's a destructive thing to it.\n\n1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:20.880\n Yes.\n\n1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:22.320\n That hurts others.\n\n1:04:22.320 --> 1:04:23.160\n Yes.\n\n1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.320\n But it's not bad people.\n\n1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:28.460\n I only troll as a reaction or towards those in power.\n\n1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:29.300\n Okay.\n\n1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:31.080\n So maybe let's talk about trolling a little bit.\n\n1:04:31.080 --> 1:04:36.000\n Because trolling, when it can, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000\n but I've seen it become a game for people\n\n1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.520\n that's enjoyable in itself.\n\n1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:44.280\n I disagree with that.\n\n1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:45.520\n That's not a good thing.\n\n1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:48.680\n If you are there just to hurt innocent people,\n\n1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:50.800\n you are a horrible human being.\n\n1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:53.920\n But doesn't trolling too easily become that?\n\n1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:55.880\n I don't know about easily.\n\n1:04:55.880 --> 1:04:58.720\n Let me give you an example of where trolling came from.\n\n1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:01.160\n The original troll was Andy Kaufman.\n\n1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.720\n He was on the show Taxi.\n\n1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:05.440\n He was a performance artist, not a stand up comedian.\n\n1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:08.080\n And this is a quintessential example of trolling.\n\n1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:10.680\n He had a character where he was basically\n\n1:05:10.680 --> 1:05:11.520\n like a lounge singer.\n\n1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:14.920\n He had these glasses on and just a terrible singer\n\n1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:15.740\n and so on and so forth.\n\n1:05:15.740 --> 1:05:16.980\n And he denied it was him.\n\n1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:21.320\n And he came out and I'm blanking on the guy's name.\n\n1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:22.160\n I can't believe it.\n\n1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:22.980\n Tony Clifton.\n\n1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:23.820\n Wow.\n\n1:05:23.820 --> 1:05:24.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:05:24.660 --> 1:05:25.680\n He came out in the audience and he goes,\n\n1:05:25.680 --> 1:05:28.160\n you know, my wife died a few years ago.\n\n1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:29.880\n Every time I look at my daughter Sarah's eyes,\n\n1:05:29.880 --> 1:05:30.760\n I can see my wife.\n\n1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:31.600\n Sarah, come out here.\n\n1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:32.560\n Let's do a duet.\n\n1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:35.000\n And Sarah was like 11, sits on his lap.\n\n1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:36.400\n They start singing duet.\n\n1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:37.560\n Her voice cracks.\n\n1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:38.960\n He smacks her across the face.\n\n1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:39.840\n What the hell are you doing?\n\n1:05:39.840 --> 1:05:42.160\n You're making an ass out of me in front of these people.\n\n1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:43.520\n She starts crying.\n\n1:05:43.520 --> 1:05:45.520\n The audience is booing and he goes,\n\n1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:47.620\n don't boo her, you're just gonna make her cry more.\n\n1:05:47.620 --> 1:05:50.160\n Now it ends.\n\n1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:51.280\n This wasn't his daughter.\n\n1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:52.120\n It wasn't even a child.\n\n1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:52.940\n It was an actress.\n\n1:05:52.940 --> 1:05:53.780\n This was all set up.\n\n1:05:53.780 --> 1:05:57.280\n He's exploiting their love of children\n\n1:05:57.280 --> 1:05:59.320\n in order to force them to be performers.\n\n1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.000\n That is trolling.\n\n1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.760\n No one is actually getting hurt.\n\n1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:05.680\n It's a humorous, though twisted exchange.\n\n1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:10.240\n If you go online looking for weak people\n\n1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:13.000\n and you are there to denigrate them\n\n1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:16.440\n just for them being weak or in some way inferior to you,\n\n1:06:16.440 --> 1:06:18.760\n that is the wrong approach.\n\n1:06:18.760 --> 1:06:21.320\n I am best on the counter punch.\n\n1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:23.440\n A lot of times people come to me\n\n1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:24.880\n and they'll be like, I hope you die.\n\n1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:25.720\n You're ugly.\n\n1:06:25.720 --> 1:06:26.540\n You're disgusting.\n\n1:06:26.540 --> 1:06:28.080\n And there's this great quote from Billy Idol,\n\n1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:30.120\n which I'm gonna mango here, something effective.\n\n1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:31.640\n I love it when people are rude to me,\n\n1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:33.580\n then I can stop pretending to be nice.\n\n1:06:33.580 --> 1:06:35.400\n Then you start fights.\n\n1:06:35.400 --> 1:06:37.200\n Now it's a chance for me to finish it\n\n1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:38.920\n and make an example of this person.\n\n1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:40.880\n But that's very, very different from\n\n1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:42.960\n I'm gonna go around and humiliate people\n\n1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:45.100\n for the sake of doing it, in my view.\n\n1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:48.440\n And I can see how one would lead to the other.\n\n1:06:48.440 --> 1:06:50.920\n Yeah, but that's my fundamental concern with it.\n\n1:06:50.920 --> 1:06:55.580\n So my dream is to put, use technology,\n\n1:06:55.580 --> 1:06:58.940\n create platforms that increase\n\n1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:00.500\n the amount of love in the world.\n\n1:07:00.500 --> 1:07:05.500\n And to me, trolling is doing the opposite.\n\n1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:09.760\n So like Andy Kaufman is brilliant.\n\n1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:12.960\n So I love, obviously, it sounds like I'm a robot thing.\n\n1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.200\n I love humor, okay?\n\n1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:16.500\n Humor is good.\n\n1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:21.000\n One, one, one, zero, one, one, one, one.\n\n1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:25.600\n But like, it's, I just see like 4chan.\n\n1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:29.440\n I see that you can often see that humor quickly turn.\n\n1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:31.920\n Yeah, because what happens is a lot of low status people,\n\n1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:34.920\n this is their one mechanism through sadism\n\n1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:38.400\n to feel empowered, and then they can hide behind,\n\n1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:40.200\n well, I'm just joking.\n\n1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.360\n Yeah, like there's this dark thing.\n\n1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:42.520\n Yeah, that's not acceptable.\n\n1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:43.360\n That's something you can't have.\n\n1:07:43.360 --> 1:07:45.760\n There's a dark LOL that people do,\n\n1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:49.000\n which is like they'll say like the shittiest thing.\n\n1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.040\n Right, because they feel. And then do LOL after.\n\n1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:55.240\n Like, as if, I don't even know like what is happening\n\n1:07:55.240 --> 1:07:56.920\n in that dark mind of yours.\n\n1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:00.520\n Because they are feeling powerless in their lives,\n\n1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.880\n and they see someone who they perceive as higher status\n\n1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:05.080\n or more powerful than them, or even not appear,\n\n1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:07.040\n and they, through their words,\n\n1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:09.500\n cause a reaction in this person.\n\n1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:11.680\n So they feel like they are, in a very literal sense,\n\n1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:12.920\n making a difference on earth,\n\n1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:15.200\n and they matter in a very dark way.\n\n1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:16.400\n It's disturbing.\n\n1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:18.240\n This is not, I mean, it's unfortunate\n\n1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:21.200\n that that term trolling is used for that,\n\n1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:22.960\n as opposed to what Andy Kaufman does,\n\n1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:24.400\n as opposed to what I do.\n\n1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:29.040\n It really is a sinister thing,\n\n1:08:29.040 --> 1:08:31.680\n and it's something I'm not at all a fan of.\n\n1:08:31.680 --> 1:08:33.880\n How do we fight that?\n\n1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:37.260\n So, like a neighboring concept of that\n\n1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:39.760\n is conspiracy theories, which is.\n\n1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:41.560\n I don't think they're neighboring at all.\n\n1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:45.300\n Well, let me give a sort of naive perspective.\n\n1:08:45.300 --> 1:08:46.640\n Maybe you can educate me on this.\n\n1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:49.800\n From my perspective, conspiracy theories\n\n1:08:49.800 --> 1:08:52.920\n are these constructs of ideas\n\n1:08:52.920 --> 1:08:55.440\n that go deeper and deeper and deeper\n\n1:08:55.440 --> 1:08:59.960\n into creating worlds\n\n1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:06.240\n where there's powerful pedophiles controlling things,\n\n1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:11.840\n like these very sophisticated models of the world\n\n1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.160\n that in part might be true,\n\n1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:15.960\n but in large part, I would say,\n\n1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:18.560\n are figments of imagination\n\n1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:22.080\n that become really useful constructs.\n\n1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:23.120\n Self reinforcing.\n\n1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:26.600\n Self reinforcing for then feeding,\n\n1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:29.840\n like empowering the trolls\n\n1:09:29.840 --> 1:09:34.840\n to attack the powerful, the conventionally powerful.\n\n1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:37.120\n I don't think that's a function of conspiracy theories.\n\n1:09:37.120 --> 1:09:38.680\n Now, let's talk about conspiracy theories,\n\n1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:39.580\n because one of my quotes is,\n\n1:09:39.580 --> 1:09:41.920\n \"'You take one red pill, not the whole bottle.'\"\n\n1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:45.560\n This concept that everything in life\n\n1:09:45.560 --> 1:09:50.480\n is at the function of a small cadre of individuals\n\n1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.200\n would be, for many people, reassuring,\n\n1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:55.880\n because as bad as it looks, you know they,\n\n1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:57.940\n whoever they are, it's usually the Jews,\n\n1:09:57.940 --> 1:10:00.840\n aren't gonna let it get that bad, that they will pull back.\n\n1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:05.820\n Or the black pill is that they aren't intentionally\n\n1:10:05.820 --> 1:10:07.280\n trying to destroy everything,\n\n1:10:07.280 --> 1:10:08.880\n and there's nothing we can do and we're doomed.\n\n1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:10.500\n And there's an amazing book by Arthur Herman\n\n1:10:10.500 --> 1:10:12.840\n called The Idea of Declined Western History.\n\n1:10:12.840 --> 1:10:14.320\n It's one of my top 10 books\n\n1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.360\n where he goes through every 20 years\n\n1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:18.200\n how there's a different population that say,\n\n1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.640\n \"'It's the end of the world, here's the proof.'\"\n\n1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:22.140\n And very often, the proof is something\n\n1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:24.080\n that is kind of self fulfilling,\n\n1:10:24.080 --> 1:10:26.520\n where it's not falsifiable.\n\n1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:27.760\n And we both have to think of ways\n\n1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:29.660\n to falsify our claims from earlier.\n\n1:10:29.660 --> 1:10:32.520\n So it is a big danger.\n\n1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:35.840\n It's a big danger online, because very quickly,\n\n1:10:35.840 --> 1:10:38.580\n if someone who you thought was good,\n\n1:10:38.580 --> 1:10:40.280\n but now is bad on one aspect,\n\n1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.800\n well, they're controlled opposition,\n\n1:10:41.800 --> 1:10:44.080\n or they've been taken over,\n\n1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:47.740\n or they've been kind of appropriated by the bad people,\n\n1:10:47.740 --> 1:10:49.920\n whoever those bad people would be.\n\n1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:52.880\n I don't know that I have a good answer for this.\n\n1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:56.040\n I don't think it's as pervasive as people think.\n\n1:10:56.040 --> 1:10:57.840\n The number of people who believe conspiracy theory?\n\n1:10:57.840 --> 1:11:00.200\n Right, I mean, and also conspiracy theory\n\n1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:04.240\n is a term used to dismiss ideas that have some currency.\n\n1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:06.800\n The Constitutional Convention was a conspiracy.\n\n1:11:06.800 --> 1:11:08.440\n The Founding Fathers got together secretly\n\n1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:10.040\n on this war to secrecy in Philadelphia,\n\n1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:11.520\n said, we're throwing out the Articles of Confederation,\n\n1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:12.960\n we're making a new government, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.320\n And Luther Martin left, and he told everyone,\n\n1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:16.580\n this is a conspiracy, and they're like,\n\n1:11:16.580 --> 1:11:17.920\n yeah, whatever, Luther Martin.\n\n1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:20.160\n So, and Jeffrey Epstein was a conspiracy,\n\n1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:21.680\n Harvey Weinstein was a conspiracy,\n\n1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:22.720\n Bill Cosby was a conspiracy.\n\n1:11:22.720 --> 1:11:24.880\n They all knew, they didn't care.\n\n1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:26.600\n Communist infiltration in America,\n\n1:11:26.600 --> 1:11:28.760\n there's a great book by Eugene Lyons\n\n1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:30.160\n called The Red Decade.\n\n1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:32.960\n They all knew every atrocity\n\n1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:36.920\n that was done under Stalinism was excused in the West,\n\n1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:37.960\n and if you didn't believe it,\n\n1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.280\n oh, you've got this crazy anti Russia conspiracy.\n\n1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:43.700\n So it's a term that is weaponized in a negative sense,\n\n1:11:43.700 --> 1:11:45.640\n but that does not at all imply\n\n1:11:45.640 --> 1:11:49.200\n that it does not have very negative real life consequences\n\n1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:52.280\n because it's kind of a cult of one, right?\n\n1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:54.080\n Like I'm at home with my computer,\n\n1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:56.120\n I bang into this ideology,\n\n1:11:56.120 --> 1:11:58.160\n anyone who doesn't agree with me,\n\n1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:00.120\n they are blind, they're oblivious,\n\n1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:02.880\n mom and dad, my friends, you don't get it.\n\n1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:05.260\n We were warned about people like you,\n\n1:12:05.260 --> 1:12:08.440\n and I think there's a very heavy correlation,\n\n1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:10.040\n and I'm not a psychiatrist, of course,\n\n1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:12.480\n between that and certain types of mild mental illness,\n\n1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:14.600\n like some kind of paranoid schizophrenia\n\n1:12:14.600 --> 1:12:17.160\n and things like that, because after a certain point,\n\n1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:20.200\n if everything is a function of this conspiracy,\n\n1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:22.920\n there's no randomness or beauty in life.\n\n1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:25.240\n Yeah, I mean, I don't know if you can say\n\n1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.160\n anything interesting about it in the way of advice\n\n1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:33.160\n of how to take a step into conspiracy theory world\n\n1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:37.540\n without completely going, like diving deep,\n\n1:12:37.540 --> 1:12:39.720\n because it seems like that's what happens.\n\n1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.500\n People can't look at Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n1:12:42.500 --> 1:12:44.000\n I can tell you what the advice I'd have\n\n1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.040\n is, seriously and rigorously, without going,\n\n1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.760\n because you can look at Jeffrey Epstein\n\n1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:52.320\n and say there's a deeper thing.\n\n1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:53.880\n You can always go deeper.\n\n1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:55.840\n It's like Jeffrey Epstein was just a tool\n\n1:12:55.840 --> 1:12:59.760\n of the lizard people, and the lizard people are the tool.\n\n1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:02.980\n Well, they say Satanists, in this case.\n\n1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.520\n Somehow, recently, very popular,\n\n1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.720\n spedophiles somehow always involved.\n\n1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:11.820\n I'm not understanding any of that.\n\n1:13:11.820 --> 1:13:15.160\n Legitimately, I say this both humorously and seriously.\n\n1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.960\n I need to look into it, and I guess the bigger question\n\n1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:21.920\n I'm asking, how does a serious human being,\n\n1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:25.920\n somebody with a position at a respectable university,\n\n1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:28.160\n look at a conspiracy theory and look into it?\n\n1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:30.600\n When I look at somebody like Jeffrey Epstein,\n\n1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:35.600\n who had a role at MIT, and I think I'm not happy,\n\n1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:40.600\n personally, I wasn't there when Jeffrey Epstein was there.\n\n1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:45.880\n I'm not happy with the behavior of people now\n\n1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:49.360\n about Jeffrey Epstein, about the bureaucracy\n\n1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.600\n and the everybody's trying to keep quiet,\n\n1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:55.840\n hoping it blows over, without really looking into any,\n\n1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:59.560\n looking in a deep philosophical way\n\n1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:03.760\n of how do we let this human being be among us?\n\n1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.000\n Can I give you a better example that is conspiratorial?\n\n1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000\n The Speaker of the House,\n\n1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.960\n the longest serving Republican Speaker of the House,\n\n1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:12.960\n Dennis Hastert, was a pedophile.\n\n1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.480\n He went to jail.\n\n1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:16.040\n The Democrats don't throw this\n\n1:14:16.040 --> 1:14:18.320\n in the Republicans faces every five minutes.\n\n1:14:18.320 --> 1:14:19.640\n Not even Democratic activists.\n\n1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:23.600\n I find that very, very odd, and not what I would predict.\n\n1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:26.200\n Now, I'm not saying there's some kind of conspiracy,\n\n1:14:26.200 --> 1:14:28.980\n but when it comes to things like sexual predation,\n\n1:14:28.980 --> 1:14:31.640\n which is something that I'm very, very concerned about.\n\n1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:32.480\n I have an uncle now.\n\n1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:33.880\n My sister just had her second kid recently.\n\n1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:34.760\n He's adorable.\n\n1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:40.760\n It's something that I don't understand.\n\n1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:44.120\n It feels as if there's a lot of people\n\n1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:45.780\n who want this to all go away.\n\n1:14:45.780 --> 1:14:47.800\n Now, I think it's also because we don't have\n\n1:14:47.800 --> 1:14:50.200\n the vocabulary and framework to discuss it,\n\n1:14:50.200 --> 1:14:52.240\n because when you start talking about things like children\n\n1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:55.600\n and these kind of issues, we want to believe it's all crap,\n\n1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:56.880\n because it's, for those of us\n\n1:14:56.880 --> 1:14:58.440\n who aren't in this kind of mindset,\n\n1:14:58.440 --> 1:15:01.160\n the idea that this happens to kids and happens frequently\n\n1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:03.720\n is something so horrible that it's just like,\n\n1:15:03.720 --> 1:15:04.800\n I don't even want to hear it,\n\n1:15:04.800 --> 1:15:07.320\n and that does these children and adult survivors\n\n1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:08.720\n an enormous disservice.\n\n1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:11.340\n So I don't know that I have any particular insight on this.\n\n1:15:11.340 --> 1:15:14.800\n But see, how do you, the Catholic Church,\n\n1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.120\n again, there's all these topics that.\n\n1:15:17.120 --> 1:15:20.000\n Public school teachers are far more proportionately\n\n1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.940\n peders of children than the Catholic Church.\n\n1:15:21.940 --> 1:15:24.640\n Man, I don't know what, you're right, you're right.\n\n1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:29.640\n Perhaps I've been reading a lot about Stalin and Hitler,\n\n1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:32.840\n somehow it's more comforting to be able to.\n\n1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:34.320\n Yeah, because it's there, and then.\n\n1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:38.520\n And then, and then the atrocities that are happening now,\n\n1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:39.920\n it's a little bit more difficult because.\n\n1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:41.600\n There was a New York Times article, sorry to interrupt you,\n\n1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:45.320\n where they had people tracking down child pornography.\n\n1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:47.560\n And I think the article said they didn't have enough people\n\n1:15:47.560 --> 1:15:51.400\n just to cover the videotapes of infants being raped.\n\n1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:54.520\n And we can even wrap our heads around reading Lolita,\n\n1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:57.440\n like, okay, she's 14, 12, okay, it's still a female.\n\n1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.760\n An infant, it's something that,\n\n1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.480\n again, like with the Stalin example,\n\n1:16:01.480 --> 1:16:02.740\n we sat down here for a hundred years,\n\n1:16:02.740 --> 1:16:03.840\n we would never think of something like this,\n\n1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:06.600\n think of it in a sexual context, it makes no sense.\n\n1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:08.820\n So, and the fact that this is international,\n\n1:16:08.820 --> 1:16:11.280\n okay, we eliminated completely in America.\n\n1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:12.760\n Well, then they're gonna go find,\n\n1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:14.240\n there's infants all over the world,\n\n1:16:14.240 --> 1:16:15.840\n there's video cameras all over the world.\n\n1:16:15.840 --> 1:16:18.420\n So then it has to become a conspiracy\n\n1:16:18.420 --> 1:16:20.780\n because someone has to film it, I'm filming it,\n\n1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:23.120\n you're buying it, your kid.\n\n1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:25.520\n It is literally a conspiratorial,\n\n1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.360\n not in the sense of like a mafia conspiracy\n\n1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:29.360\n or some government illuminati,\n\n1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.980\n but there is our networks designed to produce this product.\n\n1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:38.480\n See, but like what I'm trying to do now,\n\n1:16:38.480 --> 1:16:40.360\n and part of the, one of the nice things\n\n1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:43.000\n with like a podcast and other things I'm involved with\n\n1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.720\n is removing myself from having any kind of boss\n\n1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.200\n so I can do whatever that helps.\n\n1:16:48.200 --> 1:16:50.280\n Oh, it's so wonderful, that just happened to me,\n\n1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:52.480\n it's the most wonderful thing ever.\n\n1:16:52.480 --> 1:16:55.520\n So I could do, I can actually, in moderation,\n\n1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:57.760\n consider like look into stuff.\n\n1:16:57.760 --> 1:16:59.880\n Careful though, I was gonna write a book about this\n\n1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:00.920\n that people pointed out,\n\n1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:02.960\n you sure wanna do this research?\n\n1:17:02.960 --> 1:17:04.040\n Because if you start Googling around\n\n1:17:04.040 --> 1:17:06.660\n for this kind of stuff, it's on your computer.\n\n1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:09.800\n Oh, in that sense, I'm more concerned about,\n\n1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:11.080\n you know, it's the Nietzsche thing,\n\n1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.760\n looking into the abyss, like you wanna be very,\n\n1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:16.660\n I believe I can do this kind of thing in moderation\n\n1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:19.280\n without slipping into the depths.\n\n1:17:19.280 --> 1:17:23.520\n I think that's intelligence, that's like,\n\n1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:26.760\n I recently quote unquote looked into like\n\n1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.640\n the UFO community, the extraterrestrial,\n\n1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:32.040\n whatever community.\n\n1:17:32.040 --> 1:17:34.560\n I think it always frustrated me\n\n1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:37.240\n that the scientific community like rolled their eyes\n\n1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:40.040\n at all the UFO sightings, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:17:40.040 --> 1:17:42.760\n Even though there could be fascinating, beautiful,\n\n1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:44.720\n physical fun, like, first of all,\n\n1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.320\n there could legit. Like ball lightning.\n\n1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:49.960\n The ball lightning, right, that's at the very basic level\n\n1:17:49.960 --> 1:17:51.840\n is a fascinating thing.\n\n1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:56.840\n And also, it could be something like,\n\n1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:59.500\n I mean, I don't know, but it could be something interesting,\n\n1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:02.080\n like worth looking into.\n\n1:18:02.080 --> 1:18:04.240\n My grandfather was an air traffic controller\n\n1:18:04.240 --> 1:18:05.800\n back in the Soviet Union.\n\n1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:08.280\n And he said, we saw this stuff all the time.\n\n1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:09.800\n These are planes that were not moving\n\n1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.400\n or whatever things that were not moving\n\n1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:13.400\n according to anything we knew about.\n\n1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:14.640\n So it's absolutely real.\n\n1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:18.040\n He's not some jerk with an iPhone in his backyard.\n\n1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:22.640\n This is a military professional who understood technology,\n\n1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:24.120\n who knew where the secret bases were.\n\n1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:27.700\n So if he's telling me, it doesn't mean it's Martians,\n\n1:18:27.700 --> 1:18:29.160\n but he's telling me there's something there.\n\n1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:31.560\n And there are many examples of these like military people.\n\n1:18:31.560 --> 1:18:33.320\n These aren't some layman who sees a store.\n\n1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:34.160\n Yeah, these are legit people.\n\n1:18:34.160 --> 1:18:37.560\n Yeah, and so you can dismiss,\n\n1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:38.680\n when you're talking about professionals\n\n1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:40.280\n who are around aircraft all the time,\n\n1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:42.440\n who are familiar with aircraft at the highest levels,\n\n1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:45.000\n and they're seeing things that they can't explain,\n\n1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:46.240\n they're clearly not stupid\n\n1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:47.360\n and they're clearly not under form.\n\n1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:49.880\n So there's different ways to dismiss it.\n\n1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:53.240\n For example, you were saying\n\n1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:55.520\n that trolling is a good mechanism.\n\n1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:57.980\n I'm against that, but I'm not dismissing it\n\n1:18:57.980 --> 1:19:00.480\n by like rolling my eyes.\n\n1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:04.240\n I'm considering legitimately that you're way smarter than me\n\n1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:05.800\n and you understand the world better than me.\n\n1:19:05.800 --> 1:19:08.200\n Like I'm allowing myself to consider that possibility\n\n1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:09.040\n and thinking about it.\n\n1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:12.960\n Like maybe that's true, like seriously considering it.\n\n1:19:12.960 --> 1:19:17.120\n That's what I feel the way people should approach\n\n1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:20.040\n intelligent people, serious quote unquote people,\n\n1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:22.400\n scientists should approach conspiracy theories.\n\n1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:26.680\n Like look at it carefully.\n\n1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:29.400\n First of all, is it possible that the earth is flat?\n\n1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:32.560\n It's not trivial to show that the earth is not flat.\n\n1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:33.720\n It's a very good exercise.\n\n1:19:33.720 --> 1:19:34.560\n You should go through it.\n\n1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:35.400\n Yes.\n\n1:19:35.400 --> 1:19:36.400\n But once you go through it,\n\n1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:41.120\n you realize that based on a lot of data\n\n1:19:41.120 --> 1:19:42.360\n and a lot of evidence,\n\n1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:43.680\n and there's a lot of different experiments\n\n1:19:43.680 --> 1:19:45.600\n you can do yourself actually\n\n1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:47.200\n to show that the earth is not flat.\n\n1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:48.040\n Okay.\n\n1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:50.840\n The same kind of process can be taken\n\n1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:52.960\n for a lot of different conspiracy theories\n\n1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:54.120\n and it's helpful.\n\n1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:58.640\n And without slipping into the depths of lizard people\n\n1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:00.520\n running everything.\n\n1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:04.120\n That's where I've now listened to two episodes\n\n1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:08.600\n of Alex Jones's show\n\n1:20:08.600 --> 1:20:12.120\n because he goes crazy deep\n\n1:20:12.120 --> 1:20:16.880\n into different kind of worldviews\n\n1:20:16.880 --> 1:20:18.240\n that I was not familiar with.\n\n1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:19.120\n Right.\n\n1:20:19.120 --> 1:20:20.560\n And I don't know what to make of it.\n\n1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:22.000\n I mean, the reason I've been listening to it\n\n1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.520\n is because there's been a lot of discussions\n\n1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:27.280\n about platforming of different people.\n\n1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:28.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:30.880\n And I've been thinking about what does censorship mean?\n\n1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:34.320\n I've been thinking about whether,\n\n1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:39.320\n because Joe Rogan said he's gonna have Alex on again.\n\n1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:43.640\n And then I enjoyed it as a fan,\n\n1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:45.240\n just the entertainment of it.\n\n1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:47.520\n But then I actually listened to Alex\n\n1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:49.720\n and I was thinking,\n\n1:20:49.720 --> 1:20:53.120\n is this human being dangerous for the world?\n\n1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.520\n Like is the ideas he's saying dangerous for the world?\n\n1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:57.400\n I'm more concerned with the Russian conspiracy\n\n1:20:57.400 --> 1:20:59.120\n that we had for three years.\n\n1:20:59.120 --> 1:21:01.560\n The claim that our election was not legitimate\n\n1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:02.900\n and that everyone in the Trump White House\n\n1:21:02.900 --> 1:21:04.320\n is a stooge of Putin.\n\n1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:07.200\n And the people who said this had no consequences for this.\n\n1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:10.060\n Alex Jones doesn't have the respect that they do.\n\n1:21:10.060 --> 1:21:12.080\n These are both areas of concern for me.\n\n1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:15.320\n But he might if he's given more platform.\n\n1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:18.280\n So like the people who've,\n\n1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:19.760\n and I'd be curious to,\n\n1:21:19.760 --> 1:21:22.280\n I'm also a little bit,\n\n1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:24.080\n I don't know what to think about the idea\n\n1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:27.200\n that Russians hacked the election.\n\n1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:30.480\n That it seems too easily accepted in the mainstream media.\n\n1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:33.940\n Hillary Clinton said that how they did it\n\n1:21:33.940 --> 1:21:37.620\n was they had ads on the dark web.\n\n1:21:37.620 --> 1:21:40.360\n Now you and I both know what the dark web is.\n\n1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:43.040\n So the possibility of ads on the dark web\n\n1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:47.140\n having a proportional influence on the election\n\n1:21:47.140 --> 1:21:48.380\n is literally zero.\n\n1:21:48.380 --> 1:21:50.060\n Perhaps I should look into it more carefully,\n\n1:21:50.060 --> 1:21:53.860\n but I've found very little good data\n\n1:21:53.860 --> 1:21:58.220\n on exactly what did the Russians do to hack elections.\n\n1:21:58.220 --> 1:22:00.080\n Like technically speaking,\n\n1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:01.320\n what are we talking about here?\n\n1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.780\n Like as opposed to these kind of weird,\n\n1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:05.640\n like the best thing there's a couple of books\n\n1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:09.360\n and like reporting on like farms.\n\n1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:10.200\n Like it's.\n\n1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:11.020\n Troll farms, yeah.\n\n1:22:11.020 --> 1:22:12.080\n Troll farms.\n\n1:22:12.080 --> 1:22:14.720\n But let's see the data.\n\n1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:16.720\n Like how many exactly?\n\n1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:17.720\n What are we talking about?\n\n1:22:17.720 --> 1:22:19.880\n Like what were they doing?\n\n1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:22.960\n Not just like some anecdotal discussions of,\n\n1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:26.700\n but like relative to the bigger,\n\n1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:28.720\n the size of Facebook.\n\n1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.120\n Like if there's a few people, several hundreds,\n\n1:22:32.120 --> 1:22:36.640\n say posting different political things on Facebook\n\n1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:39.680\n relative to the full size of Facebook.\n\n1:22:39.680 --> 1:22:41.680\n Let's look at the full size.\n\n1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:42.800\n Right, you're thinking like a scientist.\n\n1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:43.640\n The actual impact.\n\n1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:44.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:47.480\n Like, cause it's fascinating the social dynamics\n\n1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:50.440\n of viral information of videos.\n\n1:22:50.440 --> 1:22:53.800\n When Donald Trump retweets something,\n\n1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.520\n I think that's understudied the effect of that.\n\n1:22:56.520 --> 1:23:01.520\n Like he retweeted a clip with Joe Rogan\n\n1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:05.480\n and Mike Tyson, where Mike Tyson says\n\n1:23:05.480 --> 1:23:08.020\n that he finds fighting orgasmic.\n\n1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:10.880\n I don't understand that, but they'd be fascinating\n\n1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:12.640\n to think like what is the ripple effect\n\n1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:16.740\n on the social dynamic of our society\n\n1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.640\n from retweeting a clip about Mike Tyson.\n\n1:23:19.640 --> 1:23:22.320\n What's your favorite Trump tweet?\n\n1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:26.800\n I tuned them out a long time ago, unfortunately.\n\n1:23:26.800 --> 1:23:31.800\n I have, this goes to the,\n\n1:23:33.080 --> 1:23:35.400\n you and I have a different relationship with Donald Trump.\n\n1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:37.360\n You appreciate the art form of trolling.\n\n1:23:37.360 --> 1:23:38.200\n Sexual versus nonsexual.\n\n1:23:38.200 --> 1:23:39.560\n Nonsexual, yeah.\n\n1:23:39.560 --> 1:23:44.320\n So I tend to prefer Bill Clinton.\n\n1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.160\n He's more my type.\n\n1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:46.000\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:47.240\n I don't know.\n\n1:23:47.240 --> 1:23:48.760\n You don't like that consent stuff.\n\n1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:50.060\n No, the consent, no.\n\n1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:53.460\n No, you appreciate the art form of trolling\n\n1:23:53.460 --> 1:23:57.060\n and Donald Trump is a master.\n\n1:23:57.060 --> 1:24:00.140\n He's the da Vinci of trolling.\n\n1:24:00.140 --> 1:24:03.580\n So I tend to think that trolling\n\n1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:05.860\n is ultimately destructive for society\n\n1:24:05.860 --> 1:24:07.940\n and then Donald Trump takes nothing seriously.\n\n1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:09.100\n He's playing a game.\n\n1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:10.500\n He's making a game out of everything.\n\n1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:11.420\n He takes a lot of things seriously.\n\n1:24:11.420 --> 1:24:14.620\n I think he's very committed to international peace.\n\n1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:16.780\n Sorry, I shouldn't speak so strong.\n\n1:24:16.780 --> 1:24:18.900\n I think he takes, actually, yes,\n\n1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:20.500\n a lot of things seriously.\n\n1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:25.260\n I meant on Twitter and the game of politics.\n\n1:24:25.260 --> 1:24:26.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:26.100 --> 1:24:29.540\n He is, he only takes.\n\n1:24:29.540 --> 1:24:30.460\n Irreverently.\n\n1:24:30.460 --> 1:24:31.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:32.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:32.140 --> 1:24:35.100\n And I appreciate it.\n\n1:24:35.100 --> 1:24:37.900\n I just would like to focus on\n\n1:24:39.140 --> 1:24:43.380\n genuine, real expressions of humanity,\n\n1:24:43.380 --> 1:24:44.660\n especially positive.\n\n1:24:44.660 --> 1:24:45.580\n Well, this is one.\n\n1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:46.620\n This is my favorite tweet.\n\n1:24:46.620 --> 1:24:48.780\n My fans got it lasered, etched,\n\n1:24:48.780 --> 1:24:50.940\n and put in a block of Lucite for me.\n\n1:24:50.940 --> 1:24:54.940\n And he said, every time I speak of the losers and haters,\n\n1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:56.740\n I do so with great affection.\n\n1:24:56.740 --> 1:24:59.500\n They cannot help the fact that they were born fucked up.\n\n1:24:59.500 --> 1:25:00.740\n That's an actual Trump tweet.\n\n1:25:00.740 --> 1:25:01.940\n It's my favorite one.\n\n1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:04.580\n And that's kind of nice.\n\n1:25:04.580 --> 1:25:05.420\n And that's love.\n\n1:25:05.420 --> 1:25:06.260\n That's love.\n\n1:25:06.260 --> 1:25:07.100\n That's kind of nice.\n\n1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:08.620\n Great affection.\n\n1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:11.300\n That, I mean.\n\n1:25:11.300 --> 1:25:12.420\n Exclamation point.\n\n1:25:12.420 --> 1:25:17.420\n I broke Lex.\n\n1:25:19.220 --> 1:25:20.340\n What is love?\n\n1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:22.900\n Yeah, the sparks are flying.\n\n1:25:22.900 --> 1:25:25.860\n But I have to kind of analyze that\n\n1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:27.500\n from a literary perspective,\n\n1:25:27.500 --> 1:25:29.860\n but it seems like there's love in there.\n\n1:25:29.860 --> 1:25:30.700\n Like a little bit.\n\n1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:31.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:31.540 --> 1:25:32.940\n It's a little bit lighthearted.\n\n1:25:32.940 --> 1:25:34.900\n Cause he's saying, even when I'm going after them,\n\n1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:36.260\n don't take it so seriously.\n\n1:25:36.260 --> 1:25:37.100\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:37.100 --> 1:25:37.940\n That's nice.\n\n1:25:37.940 --> 1:25:38.780\n It is nice.\n\n1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:39.980\n That's acknowledging the game of it.\n\n1:25:39.980 --> 1:25:40.820\n Yes.\n\n1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:41.980\n That's nice.\n\n1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:43.460\n He's not always.\n\n1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.020\n There's some things he's very, very vicious.\n\n1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:45.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:45.860 --> 1:25:46.700\n Very vicious.\n\n1:25:46.700 --> 1:25:48.540\n He's done things that I can tell you about\n\n1:25:48.540 --> 1:25:51.180\n that I'm like, this is a bad person.\n\n1:25:51.180 --> 1:25:53.100\n What do you think about one of the,\n\n1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:55.340\n okay, listen, I'm not,\n\n1:25:55.340 --> 1:25:56.420\n for people listening,\n\n1:25:56.420 --> 1:25:59.700\n I do not have Trump derangement syndrome.\n\n1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:01.660\n I don't, I see,\n\n1:26:01.660 --> 1:26:04.620\n I try to look for the good and the bad in everybody.\n\n1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:07.900\n One thing, perhaps it's irrational,\n\n1:26:07.900 --> 1:26:10.340\n but perhaps because I've been reading history,\n\n1:26:10.340 --> 1:26:14.540\n I, the one triggering thing for me\n\n1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:17.300\n is the delaying of elections.\n\n1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:20.100\n I believe in elections.\n\n1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:24.820\n And this is the part that you probably disagree with,\n\n1:26:24.820 --> 1:26:29.420\n but I, you know, I believe in the value of people voting.\n\n1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:32.340\n And I just seen too many dictators,\n\n1:26:32.340 --> 1:26:34.180\n the place where they finally,\n\n1:26:34.180 --> 1:26:36.340\n the big switch happens\n\n1:26:36.340 --> 1:26:39.780\n when you question the legitimacy of elections.\n\n1:26:39.780 --> 1:26:41.540\n Who's been questioning the legitimacy of elections\n\n1:26:41.540 --> 1:26:43.100\n for the last three years?\n\n1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:45.660\n I've only heard Donald Trump do it last year,\n\n1:26:45.660 --> 1:26:48.540\n but the last three years you're saying somebody else?\n\n1:26:48.540 --> 1:26:51.340\n You don't think, not my president, illegitimate,\n\n1:26:51.340 --> 1:26:52.980\n we're not gonna normalize him as president,\n\n1:26:52.980 --> 1:26:55.540\n Russia hacked this election, impeached,\n\n1:26:55.540 --> 1:26:56.380\n you're not a real president.\n\n1:26:56.380 --> 1:26:59.140\n You don't think that's questioning the legitimacy of 2016?\n\n1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:02.100\n Nah, it's a good, I haven't been paying attention enough,\n\n1:27:02.100 --> 1:27:05.780\n but I would imagine that argument has been,\n\n1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:08.900\n that I haven't actually heard too many people,\n\n1:27:08.900 --> 1:27:12.340\n but I imagine that's been a popular thing to say.\n\n1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:16.620\n Okay, I, but nevertheless, that's a part,\n\n1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:19.420\n that didn't, that's not a statement\n\n1:27:19.420 --> 1:27:21.580\n that gained power enough to say\n\n1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:27.100\n that Barack Obama will keep being president\n\n1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:30.380\n or Hillary Clinton should be president.\n\n1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:31.340\n Newsweek had that article,\n\n1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:34.100\n how Hillary Clinton could still be president, Newsweek.\n\n1:27:34.100 --> 1:27:35.780\n No, but she's not.\n\n1:27:35.780 --> 1:27:36.620\n That's what I'm saying.\n\n1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:41.220\n My worry isn't, my worry isn't saying\n\n1:27:41.220 --> 1:27:43.020\n that the election was illegitimate\n\n1:27:43.020 --> 1:27:45.500\n and people whining at a mass scale\n\n1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:49.340\n and then Fox News or CNN reporting for years\n\n1:27:49.340 --> 1:27:51.060\n or books being written for years.\n\n1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:54.900\n My worry is legitimately martial law.\n\n1:27:54.900 --> 1:27:57.860\n A person stays president.\n\n1:27:57.860 --> 1:27:59.140\n So here's the issue.\n\n1:27:59.140 --> 1:28:02.500\n Like there's a phase shift that happens in a dictatorship.\n\n1:28:02.500 --> 1:28:04.260\n I did a book on North Korea.\n\n1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:06.900\n I'm not someone who thinks dictatorship should be taken\n\n1:28:06.900 --> 1:28:07.740\n lightly.\n\n1:28:07.740 --> 1:28:09.940\n I'm not someone who thinks it can't happen here.\n\n1:28:09.940 --> 1:28:12.220\n I think a lot of times people are desperate\n\n1:28:12.220 --> 1:28:13.100\n for dictatorship.\n\n1:28:13.100 --> 1:28:14.100\n So I am with you.\n\n1:28:14.100 --> 1:28:15.460\n And I think this is something,\n\n1:28:15.460 --> 1:28:17.020\n if you're gonna hand wave it away,\n\n1:28:17.020 --> 1:28:18.380\n everyone else hand waved it away.\n\n1:28:18.380 --> 1:28:19.500\n Hitler's never gonna be chancellor.\n\n1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:20.340\n He's like lunatic.\n\n1:28:20.340 --> 1:28:21.180\n Oh, please.\n\n1:28:21.180 --> 1:28:22.020\n He's a joke.\n\n1:28:22.020 --> 1:28:22.860\n He's a joke.\n\n1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:24.900\n They couldn't find a publisher for Mein Kampf in English\n\n1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:28.140\n because this is some guy from some random minor party\n\n1:28:28.140 --> 1:28:29.500\n in Germany spouting nonsense.\n\n1:28:29.500 --> 1:28:31.220\n Who's gonna read this crap?\n\n1:28:31.220 --> 1:28:33.260\n So I completely agree with you in that regard.\n\n1:28:33.260 --> 1:28:34.300\n I don't think we're there.\n\n1:28:34.300 --> 1:28:37.820\n My point is Donald Trump this year\n\n1:28:37.820 --> 1:28:42.580\n had every pathway open to him to declare martial law.\n\n1:28:42.580 --> 1:28:44.460\n The cities are being burned down.\n\n1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:47.260\n He could have very easily sent in the tanks\n\n1:28:47.260 --> 1:28:49.500\n and people would have been applauding him from his side.\n\n1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:50.540\n You make me feel so good right now.\n\n1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:51.620\n But am I wrong though?\n\n1:28:51.620 --> 1:28:52.460\n No, I...\n\n1:28:52.460 --> 1:28:56.020\n What he did, he tweeted out to Mayor Wheeler of Portland.\n\n1:28:56.020 --> 1:28:58.420\n He said, call me.\n\n1:28:58.420 --> 1:29:03.180\n We will solve this in minutes, but you have to call.\n\n1:29:03.180 --> 1:29:06.500\n And he sat in his hands and they said, oh, it's his fault.\n\n1:29:06.500 --> 1:29:07.500\n The city is burning down.\n\n1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.340\n He's not doing anything.\n\n1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:10.100\n And he goes, I'm not doing anything\n\n1:29:10.100 --> 1:29:12.220\n until you ask me to do it.\n\n1:29:12.220 --> 1:29:13.980\n So I think that is,\n\n1:29:13.980 --> 1:29:16.900\n even if you think he's an aspiring dictator,\n\n1:29:16.900 --> 1:29:20.700\n that is at least a sign that there is some restraint\n\n1:29:20.700 --> 1:29:22.220\n on his aspirations.\n\n1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:28.380\n Can I just take that in as a beautiful moment of hope?\n\n1:29:29.380 --> 1:29:30.700\n So I'm gonna remember this moment.\n\n1:29:30.700 --> 1:29:33.660\n I'm gonna miss Ted Cruz, beautiful Ted.\n\n1:29:33.660 --> 1:29:34.500\n I'm gonna remember that.\n\n1:29:34.500 --> 1:29:39.500\n I mean, I should say that perhaps I'm irrationally,\n\n1:29:39.740 --> 1:29:41.580\n this is the one moment where I feel myself\n\n1:29:41.580 --> 1:29:42.980\n being a little unhealthy.\n\n1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:44.140\n I don't think you're being irrational.\n\n1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:46.300\n I think there's an asymmetry\n\n1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:48.500\n because it's kind of like, okay,\n\n1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:51.100\n either if I leave the house, it's like Russian roulette.\n\n1:29:51.100 --> 1:29:52.700\n Yeah, maybe it's like a one in six shot.\n\n1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:54.340\n I'm pulling the trigger, I'm killing myself,\n\n1:29:54.340 --> 1:29:56.140\n but that's one in six.\n\n1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:59.340\n That's not, and the consequences are so dire\n\n1:29:59.340 --> 1:30:01.660\n that a little paranoia would go a long way.\n\n1:30:01.660 --> 1:30:02.500\n There's something that.\n\n1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:04.140\n But you can't go back.\n\n1:30:04.140 --> 1:30:05.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:05.220 --> 1:30:06.580\n It's an asymmetry, yeah.\n\n1:30:06.580 --> 1:30:11.580\n The thing is, the thing that makes Donald Trump new to me,\n\n1:30:11.660 --> 1:30:14.620\n and again, I'm a little naive in these things,\n\n1:30:14.620 --> 1:30:18.660\n but he surprised me\n\n1:30:19.620 --> 1:30:23.900\n in how many ways he just didn't play by the rules.\n\n1:30:23.900 --> 1:30:25.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:25.220 --> 1:30:30.220\n And he's made me, a little ant in this ant colony,\n\n1:30:30.500 --> 1:30:34.460\n think like, well, do you have to play by the rules at all?\n\n1:30:34.460 --> 1:30:35.300\n Right.\n\n1:30:35.300 --> 1:30:38.180\n Like, why are we having elections?\n\n1:30:38.180 --> 1:30:41.500\n Why did you say, like, it's coronavirus time?\n\n1:30:41.500 --> 1:30:44.780\n Like, it's not healthy to have elections.\n\n1:30:44.780 --> 1:30:47.140\n Like, we shouldn't be, like, I could,\n\n1:30:47.140 --> 1:30:48.820\n if I put my dictator hat on.\n\n1:30:48.820 --> 1:30:52.180\n Nancy Pelosi said that Joe Biden shouldn't debate.\n\n1:30:52.180 --> 1:30:53.940\n Yeah, did she?\n\n1:30:53.940 --> 1:30:54.820\n Yes.\n\n1:30:54.820 --> 1:30:56.980\n She says she shouldn't dignify Trump with a debate.\n\n1:30:56.980 --> 1:30:57.820\n He's the president.\n\n1:30:57.820 --> 1:30:59.180\n He could be the worst president on earth,\n\n1:30:59.180 --> 1:31:01.020\n evil, despicable monster.\n\n1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:02.100\n I'll take that as an argument.\n\n1:31:02.100 --> 1:31:03.660\n So she's playing politics, but she's.\n\n1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:04.780\n I don't think that's playing politics.\n\n1:31:04.780 --> 1:31:08.100\n I think when there's a certain point where things get,\n\n1:31:08.100 --> 1:31:10.220\n when you start attacking institutions\n\n1:31:10.220 --> 1:31:14.020\n for the emergencies of the moment and acting arbitrarily,\n\n1:31:14.020 --> 1:31:15.940\n that is when things are the slippery slope.\n\n1:31:15.940 --> 1:31:18.900\n Yeah, so you're saying debates is one of the institutions.\n\n1:31:18.900 --> 1:31:21.020\n Like, that's one of the traditions to have the debates.\n\n1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:23.300\n I think the debates are extremely important.\n\n1:31:23.300 --> 1:31:25.420\n And now I don't think that someone's a good debater\n\n1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:26.540\n is gonna make a good president.\n\n1:31:26.540 --> 1:31:27.780\n I mean, that's a big problem.\n\n1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:29.140\n But you're just saying this is attacking\n\n1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:32.300\n just yet another tradition, yet another.\n\n1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:33.300\n You know, like, how if you're dating,\n\n1:31:33.300 --> 1:31:34.220\n if you're married to someone\n\n1:31:34.220 --> 1:31:35.660\n and someone throws out the word divorce,\n\n1:31:35.660 --> 1:31:38.020\n you can't unring that bell, you threw it out there.\n\n1:31:38.020 --> 1:31:40.260\n I'm saying you don't throw things out like that\n\n1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:43.620\n unless you really are ready to go down this road.\n\n1:31:43.620 --> 1:31:44.660\n And I think that is,\n\n1:31:44.660 --> 1:31:46.540\n there's nothing in the constitution about debates.\n\n1:31:46.540 --> 1:31:48.220\n We've only had them since 1980,\n\n1:31:48.220 --> 1:31:51.060\n but still, I think they are extremely important.\n\n1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:52.780\n It's also a great chance for Joe Biden\n\n1:31:52.780 --> 1:31:55.140\n to tell him to his face, you're full of crap,\n\n1:31:55.140 --> 1:31:56.260\n here's what you did, here's what you did,\n\n1:31:56.260 --> 1:31:57.100\n here's what you did.\n\n1:31:57.100 --> 1:32:01.300\n So fascinating that you're both, you acknowledge that,\n\n1:32:01.300 --> 1:32:03.820\n and yet you also see the value\n\n1:32:03.820 --> 1:32:06.300\n of tearing down the entire thing.\n\n1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:09.500\n So you're both worried about no debates,\n\n1:32:09.500 --> 1:32:11.260\n or at least in your voice, in your tone.\n\n1:32:11.260 --> 1:32:13.940\n There's a great quote by Chesterton.\n\n1:32:13.940 --> 1:32:15.520\n I'm not a fan of him at all.\n\n1:32:15.520 --> 1:32:17.180\n But he says, before you tear down a fence,\n\n1:32:17.180 --> 1:32:19.260\n make sure you know why they put it up first.\n\n1:32:19.260 --> 1:32:22.580\n So I am for tearing it all down,\n\n1:32:22.580 --> 1:32:24.300\n but there's something called like a controlled demolition,\n\n1:32:24.300 --> 1:32:26.460\n like building sevens, or there's.\n\n1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:27.300\n Allegedly.\n\n1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:30.900\n We knew we were in Tel Aviv.\n\n1:32:32.540 --> 1:32:34.460\n Hashtag building seven.\n\n1:32:34.460 --> 1:32:36.060\n We knew we were in Tel Aviv.\n\n1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:37.700\n Wow, you're faster than me.\n\n1:32:37.700 --> 1:32:40.580\n You're operating in a different level.\n\n1:32:40.580 --> 1:32:43.260\n I need to upgrade my operating system.\n\n1:32:43.260 --> 1:32:45.260\n I told you Windows 95.\n\n1:32:45.260 --> 1:32:46.740\n You're trying, yeah.\n\n1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:49.660\n Building seven.\n\n1:32:49.660 --> 1:32:52.340\n If you're gonna, it's like Indiana Jones, right?\n\n1:32:52.340 --> 1:32:54.220\n If you're gonna pull something away,\n\n1:32:54.220 --> 1:32:55.820\n make sure you have something in place first,\n\n1:32:55.820 --> 1:32:56.980\n as opposed to just breaking it,\n\n1:32:56.980 --> 1:32:59.540\n and then just, especially in politics,\n\n1:32:59.540 --> 1:33:00.940\n because it escalates.\n\n1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:04.220\n And when things escalate without any kind of response,\n\n1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:07.060\n it can go in a very bad, that's when Napoleon comes in.\n\n1:33:07.060 --> 1:33:12.060\n So what's your prediction about the Biden Trump debates?\n\n1:33:14.300 --> 1:33:16.700\n Again, I just have this weird,\n\n1:33:16.700 --> 1:33:19.660\n maybe we'll return to maybe not in this,\n\n1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:22.380\n how do we put more love into the world?\n\n1:33:22.380 --> 1:33:25.420\n And one of the things that worries me about the debates\n\n1:33:26.540 --> 1:33:31.540\n is it'll be the world's greatest troll\n\n1:33:32.860 --> 1:33:36.460\n against the grandpa on the porch.\n\n1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:37.540\n Who crapped his pants.\n\n1:33:37.540 --> 1:33:38.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:38.660 --> 1:33:42.380\n And it will not put more love into the world.\n\n1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:46.500\n It will create more mockery, like.\n\n1:33:46.500 --> 1:33:50.660\n Joe Biden did a great job against Paul Ryan in 2012.\n\n1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:51.820\n Paul Ryan was no lightweight.\n\n1:33:51.820 --> 1:33:53.180\n No one thought he was a lightweight.\n\n1:33:53.180 --> 1:33:56.700\n Joe Biden handed Sarah Pail in her ass in 2008,\n\n1:33:56.700 --> 1:33:58.100\n which isn't as easy to do as you think,\n\n1:33:58.100 --> 1:33:59.020\n because she's a female.\n\n1:33:59.020 --> 1:34:00.340\n So you're gonna come off as bullying.\n\n1:34:00.340 --> 1:34:01.740\n That's something you have to worry about.\n\n1:34:01.740 --> 1:34:03.740\n So the guy isn't,\n\n1:34:04.820 --> 1:34:08.060\n I think he is in the stages of cognitive decline.\n\n1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:11.140\n So I think it's going to be interesting.\n\n1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:13.620\n I want it to be,\n\n1:34:13.620 --> 1:34:18.100\n like Mike Tyson beating up a child,\n\n1:34:18.100 --> 1:34:20.860\n cause it'll be a source of amusement to me.\n\n1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:22.220\n But I don't know how it's going to go.\n\n1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:24.820\n Is it possible that Joe Biden will be the Mike Tyson?\n\n1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:27.020\n Yes, because in his last debate with Bernie,\n\n1:34:27.020 --> 1:34:28.500\n he was perfectly fine.\n\n1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:30.380\n And again, the guy was a sender for decades.\n\n1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:31.740\n And I don't think anyone,\n\n1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:35.020\n if you looked at Joe Biden in 2010,\n\n1:34:35.020 --> 1:34:36.620\n would have thought this guy is going to be,\n\n1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:37.940\n have his ass handed him a debate.\n\n1:34:37.940 --> 1:34:39.260\n You wouldn't think that at all.\n\n1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:41.460\n So I don't know who we're going to see.\n\n1:34:41.460 --> 1:34:45.100\n Plus he's got a lot of room to attack Trump.\n\n1:34:45.100 --> 1:34:47.500\n So I'm sure he's going to come strapped and ready\n\n1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:49.460\n and he's going to have his talking points\n\n1:34:49.460 --> 1:34:51.980\n and watch Trump dance, try to tap dance around him.\n\n1:34:51.980 --> 1:34:52.820\n And if he's in a position,\n\n1:34:52.820 --> 1:34:54.260\n I don't know what the rules of the debate are,\n\n1:34:54.260 --> 1:34:56.820\n to actually nail him to the wall,\n\n1:34:56.820 --> 1:34:57.660\n it might actually,\n\n1:34:57.660 --> 1:34:59.420\n I'm sure he's going to have a lot of lines too.\n\n1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:01.860\n The problem is Trump is the master counter puncher.\n\n1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:04.180\n So like when Hillary's had her line,\n\n1:35:04.180 --> 1:35:06.820\n she's like, well, it's a good thing that Donald Trump\n\n1:35:06.820 --> 1:35:08.460\n isn't in charge of our legal system.\n\n1:35:08.460 --> 1:35:10.260\n And he's like, yeah, you'd be in jail.\n\n1:35:10.260 --> 1:35:13.980\n It's like, oh, lady, you set him up.\n\n1:35:13.980 --> 1:35:16.700\n That's painful to watch, those debates.\n\n1:35:16.700 --> 1:35:20.500\n I mean, there's something, I think it's actually analogous.\n\n1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.060\n I've come to think of it,\n\n1:35:22.060 --> 1:35:24.660\n your conversation with me right now,\n\n1:35:24.660 --> 1:35:28.900\n some Sleepy Joe, I'm playing the role of Sleepy Joe.\n\n1:35:28.900 --> 1:35:32.940\n I actually connect to Joe because there's,\n\n1:35:32.940 --> 1:35:35.180\n I'm also incontinent.\n\n1:35:35.180 --> 1:35:37.540\n There's like these weird pauses that he does.\n\n1:35:37.540 --> 1:35:38.620\n Yes, he does.\n\n1:35:38.620 --> 1:35:42.300\n I do the same thing and it annoys the shit out of me\n\n1:35:42.300 --> 1:35:44.940\n that like in mid sentence,\n\n1:35:44.940 --> 1:35:49.380\n I'll start saying a different thing and take a tangent.\n\n1:35:49.380 --> 1:35:54.380\n I'm not as slow and drunk as I sound, always.\n\n1:35:54.460 --> 1:35:56.460\n I swear I'm more intelligent underneath it.\n\n1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:57.660\n I'm slower but less drunk.\n\n1:35:57.660 --> 1:36:00.140\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:03.700\n But the result, one of those is true, but not both, yeah.\n\n1:36:03.700 --> 1:36:08.700\n And Trump, just like you, are a master counter puncher.\n\n1:36:09.140 --> 1:36:11.860\n So it's gonna be messy.\n\n1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:13.380\n Here's the other thing, in all seriousness,\n\n1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:15.340\n Chris Wallace is the moderator.\n\n1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:17.300\n Chris Wallace has interviewed Trump several times\n\n1:36:17.300 --> 1:36:21.360\n and he was a tough, tough questioner.\n\n1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:23.700\n So I don't think he's gonna come in there\n\n1:36:23.700 --> 1:36:25.160\n with softball questions.\n\n1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:28.220\n I think he's really going to try to nail Trump down,\n\n1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:29.620\n which is tough to do.\n\n1:36:29.620 --> 1:36:30.660\n I like him a lot.\n\n1:36:30.660 --> 1:36:32.880\n Yeah, and he's like, Mr. President, sir,\n\n1:36:32.880 --> 1:36:33.920\n that's not accurate, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:36:33.920 --> 1:36:34.760\n He's done it.\n\n1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:36.340\n And Trump gets very frustrated\n\n1:36:36.340 --> 1:36:38.060\n because he doesn't just let him say whatever he wants\n\n1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:40.120\n and he hits him with the follow up.\n\n1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:43.700\n I guess he's on Fox News.\n\n1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:47.500\n And I listen to his Sunday program every once in a while.\n\n1:36:49.260 --> 1:36:51.260\n He gives me hope that, I don't know,\n\n1:36:51.260 --> 1:36:54.180\n there's something in the voice that he's not bought.\n\n1:36:55.260 --> 1:36:57.260\n There's no question he's gonna take this seriously,\n\n1:36:57.260 --> 1:37:00.720\n which I think is the best you could hope for in a moderator.\n\n1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:03.100\n It feels like there's people that might actually\n\n1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:05.740\n take the mainstream media into a place\n\n1:37:05.740 --> 1:37:08.260\n that's going to be better in the future.\n\n1:37:08.260 --> 1:37:09.740\n And we need people like him.\n\n1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:11.160\n You mean like Robespierre?\n\n1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:12.000\n What do you mean?\n\n1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.380\n Like taking the mainstream media to a better future.\n\n1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:15.980\n Like bring out the guillotines.\n\n1:37:17.980 --> 1:37:21.060\n See, you put your anarchist hat back on.\n\n1:37:21.060 --> 1:37:22.540\n I don't think Robespierre is much of an anarchist,\n\n1:37:22.540 --> 1:37:24.220\n but yeah, I get what you're saying.\n\n1:37:24.220 --> 1:37:26.940\n You don't think there should be a centralized place for news?\n\n1:37:26.940 --> 1:37:27.800\n There isn't now.\n\n1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:31.720\n Well, that's what mainstream media\n\n1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:33.440\n is supposed to represent, and it's broken.\n\n1:37:33.440 --> 1:37:36.840\n Well, it's not whatever, what do you call that?\n\n1:37:36.840 --> 1:37:39.680\n A place where people traditionally said\n\n1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:44.320\n was the legitimate source of truth.\n\n1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:47.200\n That's what the media was supposed to represent, no?\n\n1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:50.240\n That's their big branding accomplishment.\n\n1:37:50.240 --> 1:37:51.840\n That was never true?\n\n1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:53.520\n Yeah, because here's what happens.\n\n1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:55.720\n We remember the Spanish American War,\n\n1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:58.160\n remember the Maine, we have to take Cuba,\n\n1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:00.840\n yellow journalism, William Randolph Hearst, right?\n\n1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:04.200\n Then record scratch, and then we're all objective.\n\n1:38:04.200 --> 1:38:06.480\n Like when did this transition happen according to people?\n\n1:38:06.480 --> 1:38:08.160\n When you were saying that the Kaiser\n\n1:38:08.160 --> 1:38:10.280\n is the worst human being on earth?\n\n1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.280\n When you were downplaying Stalin\n\n1:38:12.280 --> 1:38:14.280\n and downplaying Hitler's atrocities?\n\n1:38:14.280 --> 1:38:16.280\n When you were saying we had to be in Vietnam?\n\n1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:19.080\n At what point, WMDs, when did it change?\n\n1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:19.920\n It never changed.\n\n1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:22.360\n You just are better con artists at a certain point,\n\n1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.620\n and now the mask is dropping.\n\n1:38:23.620 --> 1:38:27.280\n Yeah, but don't you think there's, at its best,\n\n1:38:27.280 --> 1:38:32.280\n like investigative journalism can uncover truth\n\n1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:37.320\n in a way that like Reddit, subreddits can't?\n\n1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:41.560\n You know, Reddit, sure, I agree.\n\n1:38:41.560 --> 1:38:43.820\n At its best, absolutely, that's not even a dispute.\n\n1:38:43.820 --> 1:38:48.740\n But like, don't you think like fake it until you make it\n\n1:38:48.740 --> 1:38:49.880\n is the right way to do it?\n\n1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:51.100\n Meaning like the.\n\n1:38:51.100 --> 1:38:52.320\n Fake the news?\n\n1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:55.800\n No, no, no, I meant the news saying like,\n\n1:38:55.800 --> 1:38:59.960\n we dream of doing, of arriving at the truth\n\n1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:01.240\n and reporting the truth.\n\n1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:02.080\n They don't say that.\n\n1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:04.680\n CNN had an advertisement that said this is an apple.\n\n1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:06.040\n We only report facts.\n\n1:39:06.040 --> 1:39:07.120\n That's a lie.\n\n1:39:07.120 --> 1:39:10.920\n No, that's now, and now it's clear things have changed.\n\n1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:11.800\n They haven't changed.\n\n1:39:11.800 --> 1:39:14.980\n You're just more, you're more aware of their chicanery.\n\n1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:17.880\n But, okay, so the.\n\n1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:19.320\n How many people died in Iraq?\n\n1:39:19.320 --> 1:39:22.760\n Because Saddam Hussein was about to launch WMDs.\n\n1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:24.000\n Who had consequences for this?\n\n1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:25.400\n No one.\n\n1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:26.480\n This isn't a minor thing.\n\n1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:28.760\n This is lots of dead people.\n\n1:39:28.760 --> 1:39:30.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:34.240\n And also, I mean, dead people, it's horrible,\n\n1:39:34.240 --> 1:39:36.520\n but also the money, which has, like we said,\n\n1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:37.680\n economic effects that.\n\n1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:39.560\n Marianne Williamson, I think it was, had the,\n\n1:39:39.560 --> 1:39:41.860\n or Trump, both of them had the great point that goes,\n\n1:39:41.860 --> 1:39:42.720\n that's like a trillion dollars.\n\n1:39:42.720 --> 1:39:43.640\n How many schools would that build?\n\n1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:44.480\n How many roads would that build?\n\n1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:46.880\n Even here, why are we building hospitals in Iraq\n\n1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:49.000\n that we destroyed when we could building hospitals here?\n\n1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:49.840\n It makes no sense.\n\n1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:50.660\n It's horrifying.\n\n1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:53.200\n So who's responsible for that?\n\n1:39:53.200 --> 1:39:54.720\n Like who?\n\n1:39:54.720 --> 1:39:55.920\n Alex Jones.\n\n1:39:55.920 --> 1:40:00.920\n No, I meant for, well, so who's responsible\n\n1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:04.560\n for arriving at the truth of that,\n\n1:40:04.560 --> 1:40:09.360\n of speaking to the money spent on the wars in Iraq?\n\n1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:11.800\n This is one of the great things about social media.\n\n1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:13.160\n Twitter, you have faith in Twitter.\n\n1:40:13.160 --> 1:40:14.720\n Not specifically Twitter, but yeah,\n\n1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:16.320\n social media's the whole, what anyone could.\n\n1:40:16.320 --> 1:40:18.240\n Here's another great example.\n\n1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:22.160\n Before, if you were talking about police brutality\n\n1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:24.880\n or these riots, you would have to perceive it\n\n1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:26.800\n in the way it was framed and presented to you.\n\n1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.120\n Nicholas Sandman's another example.\n\n1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:30.280\n Breonna Taylor, all these things.\n\n1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:32.160\n Well, we don't have footage of her.\n\n1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:34.160\n You would have to perceive in the way that it's edited\n\n1:40:34.160 --> 1:40:35.920\n and presented to you by the corporate press.\n\n1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:38.300\n Now everyone is a video, has a video camera.\n\n1:40:38.300 --> 1:40:39.900\n Everyone has their perspective.\n\n1:40:39.900 --> 1:40:42.840\n And it's very useful when these incidents happen\n\n1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:45.360\n where you could see the same incident from several angles\n\n1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:48.000\n and you don't need Don Lemon or Chris Wallace\n\n1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.040\n to tell me what this means.\n\n1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:50.880\n I can see with my own eyes.\n\n1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:55.560\n Yeah, I've been very pleasantly surprised about the power.\n\n1:40:55.560 --> 1:40:58.280\n See, the mob, again, gets in the way.\n\n1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:03.280\n They get emotional and they destroy the ability\n\n1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:05.040\n for people to reason.\n\n1:41:05.040 --> 1:41:09.960\n But you're right that truth is unobstructed on social media.\n\n1:41:09.960 --> 1:41:14.520\n Like if you're careful and patient, you can see the truth.\n\n1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:16.640\n Like for example, data on COVID,\n\n1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:19.920\n some of the best sources are doctors.\n\n1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:22.480\n Like if you wanna know the truth about the coronavirus\n\n1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:27.400\n and what's happening is there's follow people on Twitter.\n\n1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:29.200\n There's certain people that are just like sourcing them\n\n1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:32.040\n from me versus the CDC and the WHO.\n\n1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:33.680\n It's, that's fast.\n\n1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:36.160\n I mean, well, it's kind of anarchy, right?\n\n1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:37.000\n Yes, it is.\n\n1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.940\n It's not kind of, it is anarchy, yes.\n\n1:41:38.940 --> 1:41:41.720\n I mean, well, there's some censorship\n\n1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:42.560\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:41:42.560 --> 1:41:43.920\n You have censorship under anarchy\n\n1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:45.000\n in the sense that you're talking about.\n\n1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.480\n Like people get kicked off of Twitter.\n\n1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:48.320\n That's a drawing backwards.\n\n1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:49.600\n How do you kick somebody, okay.\n\n1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:50.920\n So, I mean, it's a.\n\n1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:52.360\n Private company.\n\n1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:53.400\n Private company.\n\n1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:56.720\n Most people wouldn't say Twitter is working,\n\n1:41:56.720 --> 1:41:59.420\n but that's probably because they take for granted\n\n1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:01.320\n how well it's working and they're just complaining\n\n1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:03.920\n about the small part of it that's broken.\n\n1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:04.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:07.840 --> 1:42:09.360\n Okay, another question about.\n\n1:42:09.360 --> 1:42:10.240\n You feel better?\n\n1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:15.240\n No, by the way, I mean, I had a personal gripe\n\n1:42:15.960 --> 1:42:19.940\n with the situation about the, not a personal gripe,\n\n1:42:19.940 --> 1:42:24.940\n but I felt overly emotional about the possibility\n\n1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:29.440\n that there will be some of Donald Trump\n\n1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:31.760\n messing with the election process,\n\n1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:33.040\n but you made me feel better.\n\n1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:33.880\n Good.\n\n1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:36.560\n Like saying like, if he had a bunch of opportunities\n\n1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:41.560\n to do what I would have done if I was a dictator,\n\n1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:47.080\n I would, the first time those riots over George Floyd,\n\n1:42:47.080 --> 1:42:49.880\n I would have instituted martial law.\n\n1:42:49.880 --> 1:42:52.080\n Do you know what I remember very vividly?\n\n1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:55.160\n Is after 9 11 and everyone was waiting for George Bush\n\n1:42:55.160 --> 1:42:57.920\n to give his speech and he had 98% approved rating.\n\n1:42:57.920 --> 1:42:59.040\n And I remember very vividly,\n\n1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:03.000\n cause if he had said we're suspending the constitution,\n\n1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:04.140\n everyone would have cheered for him.\n\n1:43:04.140 --> 1:43:06.400\n Like he couldn't get enough support at that time.\n\n1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:07.800\n And he didn't do it.\n\n1:43:07.800 --> 1:43:10.720\n And I can't say anything really good about George W. Bush.\n\n1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:12.480\n I'm not a fan of his to say the least.\n\n1:43:12.480 --> 1:43:15.880\n So I think you and I, and other people who are familiar\n\n1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:19.500\n with totalitarian regimes to some extent from our ancestry\n\n1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:22.880\n or whatever, from research should always be the ones\n\n1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:24.640\n freaking out and warning,\n\n1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:28.980\n but we should also be aware of we got a ways to go\n\n1:43:28.980 --> 1:43:30.560\n before it's Hitler.\n\n1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:34.360\n And thankfully there are a lot of dominoes\n\n1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:36.360\n that have to fall into place before Hitler.\n\n1:43:36.360 --> 1:43:38.400\n It's like the game secret Hitler, it's a board game\n\n1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:40.100\n before Hitler becomes Hitler.\n\n1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:43.080\n Like it's not, especially in America,\n\n1:43:43.080 --> 1:43:45.600\n there's lots of things that have to happen\n\n1:43:45.600 --> 1:43:47.600\n before you really get to that point.\n\n1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:50.460\n I mean, FDR was for all intents and purposes a dictator,\n\n1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:52.400\n but even then the worst you could say,\n\n1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.580\n and this is not something that you should take lightly\n\n1:43:54.580 --> 1:43:56.540\n was internment of Japanese citizens,\n\n1:43:56.540 --> 1:43:58.040\n but they weren't murdered.\n\n1:43:58.040 --> 1:44:01.800\n They weren't under lock and key in the sense of like in cells.\n\n1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:04.120\n So things could have gotten a lot worse for him.\n\n1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.560\n We have to, I mean, Hitler is such a horrible person\n\n1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:07.400\n to bring up because.\n\n1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:08.480\n He's Mussolini.\n\n1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:12.840\n Yeah, Mussolini is better because Hitler is so close\n\n1:44:12.840 --> 1:44:15.600\n and connected to the atrocities of the Holocaust.\n\n1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:17.400\n There's all this stuff that led up to the war\n\n1:44:17.400 --> 1:44:18.240\n and the war itself.\n\n1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:20.760\n Say that there was no Holocaust,\n\n1:44:20.760 --> 1:44:23.440\n Hitler would probably be viewed differently.\n\n1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:24.680\n Yes, I should think so.\n\n1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:26.920\n Well, I mean, but.\n\n1:44:26.920 --> 1:44:29.020\n You think, that's a very controversial stance.\n\n1:44:29.020 --> 1:44:30.240\n You think Hitler would be viewed differently\n\n1:44:30.240 --> 1:44:31.620\n if it wasn't for the Holocaust?\n\n1:44:31.620 --> 1:44:36.620\n Well, I mean, but it's a funny thing that the,\n\n1:44:38.840 --> 1:44:43.840\n I would say the death of how many, 40, 50 million.\n\n1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:46.920\n I mean, I don't know how you calculate it.\n\n1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:50.920\n It's not seen as bad as the 6 million.\n\n1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:52.780\n Oh yeah, because of Mao and Stalin.\n\n1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:56.260\n Yeah, but it's interesting.\n\n1:44:56.260 --> 1:44:57.320\n I'm working on it.\n\n1:44:57.320 --> 1:44:58.160\n You're working on it.\n\n1:44:58.160 --> 1:44:59.000\n Yeah, the next book I'm talking about.\n\n1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.040\n Reminding, well, it's good.\n\n1:45:01.040 --> 1:45:02.480\n I'm glad a good writer is,\n\n1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:03.800\n because the world's not reminded.\n\n1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:05.080\n My last book, The New Right,\n\n1:45:05.080 --> 1:45:06.440\n I had to deal with something like the Nazis.\n\n1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:07.560\n And one of the points they make is,\n\n1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:09.020\n how come everyone knows about the Holocaust,\n\n1:45:09.020 --> 1:45:10.640\n but no one knows about the Holodomor?\n\n1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:11.660\n And they're right.\n\n1:45:11.660 --> 1:45:12.700\n We should know about this,\n\n1:45:12.700 --> 1:45:14.640\n because it is a great example of both\n\n1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:17.360\n how the Western media were depraved,\n\n1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:19.680\n but also what human beings are capable of.\n\n1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:22.320\n And those scars are still,\n\n1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.080\n many Americans think Russia and Ukraine are the same thing.\n\n1:45:25.080 --> 1:45:27.100\n Oh, Trump's in bed with the Ukrainians,\n\n1:45:27.100 --> 1:45:27.940\n Trump's about the Russians,\n\n1:45:27.940 --> 1:45:29.440\n they think it's the same thing.\n\n1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:31.720\n For us, it's complete lunacy.\n\n1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:33.760\n But this is the kind of thing where Pol Pot\n\n1:45:33.760 --> 1:45:35.240\n is another example,\n\n1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:38.320\n where people have no clue of what has been done\n\n1:45:38.320 --> 1:45:40.000\n to their fellow man on the face of this earth,\n\n1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:41.420\n and they should know.\n\n1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:43.920\n How much of that do you lay at the hands of communism?\n\n1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:46.480\n How much are you with like a Jordan Pearson\n\n1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:51.200\n who is intricately connecting the atrocities,\n\n1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:53.880\n like you're saying, 1930s Ukraine,\n\n1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:55.200\n where people were starved?\n\n1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:58.400\n I recently, my grandmother recently passed away,\n\n1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:02.120\n and she survived that as a kid.\n\n1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:07.120\n Which is, those people, I mean, they're tough.\n\n1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:09.880\n They're tough.\n\n1:46:09.880 --> 1:46:11.960\n Like that whole region is tough,\n\n1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:13.280\n because they survived that,\n\n1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:18.280\n and then right after, occupation of Nazis, of Germans.\n\n1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:24.440\n How much do you lay that at communism as an ideology,\n\n1:46:24.440 --> 1:46:27.920\n versus Stalin, the man?\n\n1:46:27.920 --> 1:46:31.040\n I think Lenin was building concentration camps\n\n1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:33.220\n while he was around, and slave labor.\n\n1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.840\n I don't, I think it's clearly both.\n\n1:46:36.840 --> 1:46:38.600\n There are certain variants of communism\n\n1:46:38.600 --> 1:46:41.760\n that were far, like Khrushchev and Gorbachev,\n\n1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:44.600\n the reason the Soviet Union fell apart,\n\n1:46:44.600 --> 1:46:47.000\n and this is kind of, I'm gonna spoil the end of the book.\n\n1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:48.920\n There's an amazing book called Revolution 1989,\n\n1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:50.620\n it's like the most beautiful book I've ever read,\n\n1:46:50.620 --> 1:46:53.300\n by Viktor Sebastian, he's a Hungarian author.\n\n1:46:53.300 --> 1:46:55.320\n And basically what happens in 1989,\n\n1:46:55.320 --> 1:46:56.520\n Poland has their elections,\n\n1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:58.600\n and then in 1990, they kind of let in\n\n1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:00.360\n the labor people to the government.\n\n1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:04.480\n And people start crossing borders in the Eastern Bloc,\n\n1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:06.260\n and you had Hanukkah from Eastern Germany,\n\n1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:09.360\n and Ceausescu from Romania calling Gorbachev,\n\n1:47:09.360 --> 1:47:11.080\n because those are the two toughest ones,\n\n1:47:11.080 --> 1:47:13.040\n by communist standards, they go,\n\n1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:16.280\n they're just escaping, we're gonna lose everything.\n\n1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:18.040\n You gotta send in the tanks, like you did in Hungary,\n\n1:47:18.040 --> 1:47:20.540\n like you did in Czechoslovakia in 68.\n\n1:47:20.540 --> 1:47:22.280\n And Gorbachev goes, I'm not sending the tanks.\n\n1:47:22.280 --> 1:47:24.960\n And they go, dude, if you don't send in the tanks,\n\n1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:28.360\n it's all done, and he goes, nope, I'm not that kind of guy.\n\n1:47:28.360 --> 1:47:31.920\n And they were right, Ceausescu was personally shot\n\n1:47:31.920 --> 1:47:33.520\n with his wife up against the wall,\n\n1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:35.240\n Hanukkah, I forget what happened to him,\n\n1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:37.460\n but they all self liberated.\n\n1:47:37.460 --> 1:47:39.840\n My friend who was born in Czechoslovakia,\n\n1:47:39.840 --> 1:47:42.220\n his mom was pregnant under communism,\n\n1:47:42.220 --> 1:47:43.840\n and she never even imagined he'd be free,\n\n1:47:43.840 --> 1:47:45.560\n and he was born under free.\n\n1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:46.960\n And they were all looking around,\n\n1:47:46.960 --> 1:47:48.720\n all these countries that self liberated,\n\n1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:50.440\n because they're like, this is a trick, right?\n\n1:47:50.440 --> 1:47:52.520\n They're trying to figure out who's like not good,\n\n1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:54.840\n so that they can arrest us on mass, and they didn't.\n\n1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:58.880\n So even within communism,\n\n1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:02.480\n there are bad guys and better guys.\n\n1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:06.080\n But we talked about anarchy, we talked about democracy.\n\n1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:09.240\n Do you see, like there's democratic socialism\n\n1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:13.400\n conversations going on in the popular culture,\n\n1:48:13.400 --> 1:48:18.400\n socialism is seen as like evil, or for some people, great?\n\n1:48:18.580 --> 1:48:19.840\n Sure.\n\n1:48:19.840 --> 1:48:24.160\n What are your thoughts about it as in a political ideology?\n\n1:48:24.160 --> 1:48:25.360\n Evil.\n\n1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:26.480\n So you're on the evil side?\n\n1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:27.320\n Yes.\n\n1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:28.140\n Fundamentally?\n\n1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:28.980\n Yes.\n\n1:48:28.980 --> 1:48:33.980\n What is it, you know, what makes it evil?\n\n1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:38.040\n What's like structurally, if you were to try to analyze?\n\n1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:39.920\n Sure, I'd say three ways.\n\n1:48:39.920 --> 1:48:41.720\n Morally, no person has the right\n\n1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:43.960\n to tell another person how to live their life.\n\n1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:46.520\n Economically, it's not possible\n\n1:48:46.520 --> 1:48:48.440\n to make calculations under socialism.\n\n1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:51.780\n It's only the prices that are information that tells me,\n\n1:48:51.780 --> 1:48:53.380\n oh, this is, we need to produce more of this,\n\n1:48:53.380 --> 1:48:54.880\n we need to produce less of this.\n\n1:48:54.880 --> 1:48:56.480\n Without prices being able to adjust\n\n1:48:56.480 --> 1:48:59.940\n and give information to producers and consumers,\n\n1:48:59.940 --> 1:49:02.040\n you have no way of being able to produce\n\n1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:03.520\n effectively or efficiently.\n\n1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:08.120\n And also it is, it turns people against each other.\n\n1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:09.920\n When you force people to interact,\n\n1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:11.320\n when you force them into relationships,\n\n1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:13.040\n when you force them into jobs,\n\n1:49:13.040 --> 1:49:14.380\n and you don't give them any choice,\n\n1:49:14.380 --> 1:49:17.120\n when there's a monopoly, the consequence of monopoly,\n\n1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:19.760\n everyone's familiar with ostensibly under capitalism,\n\n1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:21.520\n but somehow when it's a government monopoly,\n\n1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:23.000\n all those economic principles don't work,\n\n1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:24.280\n it doesn't make any sense.\n\n1:49:24.280 --> 1:49:26.180\n But there's force in democracy too,\n\n1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:29.040\n it's just you're saying there's a bit more force\n\n1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:31.280\n in socialism.\n\n1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:33.580\n But that's interesting that you say\n\n1:49:33.580 --> 1:49:34.880\n that there's not enough information.\n\n1:49:34.880 --> 1:49:36.680\n I mean, that's ultimately,\n\n1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:40.360\n you need to have really good data\n\n1:49:40.360 --> 1:49:42.200\n to achieve the goals of the system,\n\n1:49:43.080 --> 1:49:45.680\n even if there's no corruption.\n\n1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:47.240\n You just need to have the information.\n\n1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.200\n Which you can't.\n\n1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:49.840\n And capitalism provides you\n\n1:49:49.840 --> 1:49:54.840\n a really strong source of real time information.\n\n1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.640\n And if capitalism at its best and cleanest,\n\n1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:05.560\n which is perfect information, is available,\n\n1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:08.360\n there's no manipulation of information.\n\n1:50:08.360 --> 1:50:10.440\n That's one of the problems, okay.\n\n1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:13.760\n Can we talk about some candidates,\n\n1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:17.200\n the ones we got and possible alternatives?\n\n1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:21.920\n So one question I have is, why do we have,\n\n1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:25.440\n within this system, why do we have the candidates we have?\n\n1:50:27.800 --> 1:50:30.960\n It seems, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:33.140\n highly unsatisfactory.\n\n1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:39.520\n Is anyone actually excited about our current candidates?\n\n1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:41.040\n I'm kind of excited,\n\n1:50:41.040 --> 1:50:43.200\n because no matter who wins the election,\n\n1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:44.420\n it's gonna be hilarious.\n\n1:50:44.420 --> 1:50:46.240\n So that is something that I'm excited about.\n\n1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.520\n From a humor perspective.\n\n1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.040\n Is that what the whole system is?\n\n1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:52.120\n So that's one theory of the case,\n\n1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:55.960\n is the entire thing is optimized for viewership.\n\n1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:56.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:59.240\n And excitement by definitions\n\n1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.540\n of like the reality show kind of excitement.\n\n1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:04.320\n I think it is,\n\n1:51:04.320 --> 1:51:06.820\n if you look at what happened with Brett Kavanaugh,\n\n1:51:06.820 --> 1:51:11.680\n this is not a career that would draw people\n\n1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:14.600\n who are, you might say, quality.\n\n1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:15.960\n Because no matter who they are,\n\n1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.800\n there would be a huge incentive from the other team\n\n1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:20.960\n to denigrate them and humiliate them\n\n1:51:20.960 --> 1:51:21.980\n in the worst possible ways.\n\n1:51:21.980 --> 1:51:25.200\n Because as the two teams lose their legitimacy\n\n1:51:25.200 --> 1:51:27.880\n among Gen Pop, it's gonna get harder and harder\n\n1:51:27.880 --> 1:51:30.640\n for them to maintain any kind of claims to authority,\n\n1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:32.080\n which is something I like,\n\n1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:33.600\n but which does kind of play out\n\n1:51:33.600 --> 1:51:36.080\n in certain nefarious ways.\n\n1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:37.980\n So people, the best of the best,\n\n1:51:37.980 --> 1:51:40.100\n are not gonna wanna be politicians.\n\n1:51:40.100 --> 1:51:42.520\n Yeah, because I could have a job,\n\n1:51:42.520 --> 1:51:45.720\n or have a job interview and I'm running Yahoo or whatever,\n\n1:51:45.720 --> 1:51:49.200\n or I could, for 18 months, have to eat, you know,\n\n1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:51.280\n corn dogs looking like I'm going down on someone\n\n1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:53.600\n and shake hands and have all this,\n\n1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:56.440\n my family and on social media daily\n\n1:51:56.440 --> 1:51:58.880\n called the worst things, for what?\n\n1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:02.020\n And then I'm still not guaranteed the position.\n\n1:52:02.020 --> 1:52:05.520\n But the flip side of that, like from my perspective,\n\n1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:07.180\n is the competition is weak.\n\n1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:13.240\n Meaning, like, you need a minimum amount of eloquence,\n\n1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:16.120\n eloquence, clearly, that I don't,\n\n1:52:16.120 --> 1:52:17.880\n the bar which I did not pass.\n\n1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:19.560\n I don't think either of them would be considered\n\n1:52:19.560 --> 1:52:21.260\n particularly eloquent, Biden or Trump.\n\n1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:22.800\n No, I know, but that's what I'm saying.\n\n1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:26.500\n The competition, like if you were,\n\n1:52:26.500 --> 1:52:28.200\n wanted to become a politician,\n\n1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:30.300\n if you wanted to run for president,\n\n1:52:30.300 --> 1:52:32.120\n the opportunity is there.\n\n1:52:32.120 --> 1:52:33.800\n Like if you were at all competent.\n\n1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:36.320\n Like if you had, so like Andrew Yang is an example\n\n1:52:36.320 --> 1:52:37.840\n of somebody who has a bunch of ideas,\n\n1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:42.840\n is somewhat eloquent, like young, energetic.\n\n1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:47.160\n It feels like there should be thousands of Andrew Yangs,\n\n1:52:47.160 --> 1:52:49.280\n like that would enter the domain.\n\n1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:50.440\n He went nowhere.\n\n1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:54.200\n Well, I wouldn't say he went nowhere.\n\n1:52:54.200 --> 1:52:55.760\n He generated quite a bit of excitement.\n\n1:52:55.760 --> 1:52:59.820\n He just didn't go very far, that's, okay.\n\n1:52:59.820 --> 1:53:01.040\n You don't have to run for president\n\n1:53:01.040 --> 1:53:02.360\n to generate excitement with your ideas.\n\n1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:04.240\n You could be a podcast host, I'm not even joking.\n\n1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:07.780\n That's right, that's right, that's right.\n\n1:53:07.780 --> 1:53:09.920\n And he's both, Andrew Yang.\n\n1:53:09.920 --> 1:53:10.840\n Oh, he's a podcast?\n\n1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:13.560\n Yeah, he has a podcast called Yang Speaks.\n\n1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:14.600\n Oh, okay, cool.\n\n1:53:19.720 --> 1:53:24.500\n Oh, wow, the music of the way you said, yeah, cool.\n\n1:53:24.500 --> 1:53:25.880\n It's the way my mom talks to me\n\n1:53:25.880 --> 1:53:28.640\n when I tell her something exciting going on in my life.\n\n1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:32.780\n Oh, that's nice, honey.\n\n1:53:32.780 --> 1:53:34.480\n Oh, you made a robot, that's cool.\n\n1:53:35.880 --> 1:53:36.720\n A mixed coffee?\n\n1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:38.800\n Oh, you're still single, though, aren't you?\n\n1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:43.120\n I wonder why, I wonder why.\n\n1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:44.800\n Make yourself a robot wife?\n\n1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:46.500\n Give me some robot grandchildren.\n\n1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:53.640\n Okay, but first of all, okay,\n\n1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:55.120\n let me ask you about Andrew Yang\n\n1:53:55.120 --> 1:53:58.960\n because he represents fresh energy.\n\n1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:02.180\n You don't find him fresh or energetic, you know?\n\n1:54:02.180 --> 1:54:07.180\n Like, is there any candidate you wish was in the mix\n\n1:54:07.220 --> 1:54:09.360\n that was in the mix you wish was\n\n1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:11.260\n one of the last two remaining?\n\n1:54:11.260 --> 1:54:14.840\n Yeah, people like Marianne Williamson, I thought was great.\n\n1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:16.520\n Tulsi, I thought was great.\n\n1:54:16.520 --> 1:54:18.780\n Amy Klobuchar got a bad rap.\n\n1:54:18.780 --> 1:54:21.260\n I think she held her own.\n\n1:54:21.260 --> 1:54:24.080\n Smart, she wasn't particularly funny, that's okay.\n\n1:54:24.080 --> 1:54:26.240\n I think she was nonthreatening to a lot of people.\n\n1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:28.160\n What did you like about them?\n\n1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:29.640\n I guess I just named all women, that's interesting.\n\n1:54:29.640 --> 1:54:31.540\n It wasn't even intentional.\n\n1:54:31.540 --> 1:54:33.480\n Tulsi, I liked that she was aggressive,\n\n1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:38.480\n has a good resume and is not staying the course\n\n1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:39.760\n for the establishment.\n\n1:54:39.760 --> 1:54:42.720\n Marianne Williamson, I like because she comes from a place,\n\n1:54:42.720 --> 1:54:45.040\n from what it seems, of genuine compassion.\n\n1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:47.160\n Maybe she's a sociopath, I don't know.\n\n1:54:47.160 --> 1:54:50.600\n I read her book and it actually affected me profoundly\n\n1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:53.280\n because it's very rare when you read a book\n\n1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:55.500\n and there's even that one idea that blows your mind\n\n1:54:55.500 --> 1:54:56.840\n and that you kind of think about all the time.\n\n1:54:56.840 --> 1:54:59.000\n And there was one such idea in her book\n\n1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.560\n about she was teaching something called A Course\n\n1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:02.560\n in Miracles in Hollywood.\n\n1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:04.120\n I think she still teaches it.\n\n1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:07.540\n And this was during the 80s, the height of the AIDS crisis.\n\n1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:09.840\n And all these young men in the prime of their life\n\n1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:11.760\n were dropping like flies.\n\n1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:13.180\n And she's trying to give them hope.\n\n1:55:13.180 --> 1:55:16.240\n Well, good luck, they're dying, no one cares.\n\n1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:17.760\n And they're like, you can't tell us\n\n1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:21.480\n that they're gonna cure this, that's a lie.\n\n1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:25.420\n And she goes, what if I told you they're not gonna cure it?\n\n1:55:25.420 --> 1:55:28.180\n What if I told you it's gonna be to like diabetes?\n\n1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:30.560\n They cut off your foot and you're gonna go blind.\n\n1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:33.200\n Would that be something that you can hope for?\n\n1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:34.920\n And when you put it like that, it's like, yeah.\n\n1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:36.760\n Like if you're talking to someone like a homeless junkie\n\n1:55:36.760 --> 1:55:38.080\n and you're like, you could be a doctor,\n\n1:55:38.080 --> 1:55:39.840\n you're a lawyer or a lawyer, like cool story.\n\n1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:43.400\n Like you could have a studio apartment\n\n1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.880\n with a terrible roommate and a shitty job.\n\n1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:48.400\n But when you're on the street,\n\n1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:51.360\n cooking breakfast in a teaspoon and you hear that,\n\n1:55:51.360 --> 1:55:53.360\n you're like, wait, would that really be so bad?\n\n1:55:53.360 --> 1:55:54.800\n Is that really so much worse than this?\n\n1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:56.240\n No, and it becomes something.\n\n1:55:56.240 --> 1:55:59.040\n So when she put it in those terms, I'm like, wow,\n\n1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:01.700\n this woman that really did a number on me\n\n1:56:01.700 --> 1:56:04.760\n in terms of teaching people how to be hopeful.\n\n1:56:04.760 --> 1:56:05.920\n Small steps, I guess.\n\n1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:09.120\n But it's also, then it becomes less of I need a miracle\n\n1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:11.520\n to be like, oh, this is really manageable.\n\n1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:12.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:15.000\n And it's absurd to think it's impossible.\n\n1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.920\n What about what's your take on Unity 2020\n\n1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:22.920\n that Brett Weinstein pushed forward?\n\n1:56:22.920 --> 1:56:26.360\n It was DOA, he couldn't even stand up to Twitter.\n\n1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:27.200\n Dead on arrival.\n\n1:56:27.200 --> 1:56:28.040\n Dead on arrival.\n\n1:56:28.040 --> 1:56:29.520\n He couldn't even stand up to Twitter, let alone,\n\n1:56:29.520 --> 1:56:31.040\n or to Facebook, they got blocked,\n\n1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:31.880\n let alone to Facebook.\n\n1:56:31.880 --> 1:56:33.660\n It was not hugely problematic, by the way,\n\n1:56:33.660 --> 1:56:35.640\n that Twitter would block that.\n\n1:56:35.640 --> 1:56:36.800\n Not at all.\n\n1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:37.900\n I don't know why they blocked it,\n\n1:56:37.900 --> 1:56:40.440\n but I believe, I don't know what problematic means.\n\n1:56:40.440 --> 1:56:42.560\n That's a word that does a lot of work\n\n1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:45.600\n that people wanted to do conceptually.\n\n1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:49.680\n The idea that Unity is taking the rejects from each party\n\n1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:52.000\n and we're gonna have something that no one likes\n\n1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.480\n and therefore it's gonna be a compromise is absurd.\n\n1:56:54.480 --> 1:56:56.720\n The last time we had this kind of Unity ticket\n\n1:56:56.720 --> 1:56:59.440\n was the Civil War, where you had Andrew Johnson\n\n1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:01.640\n from the Democrats and Lincoln from the Republicans.\n\n1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:03.720\n This was not something that ended well,\n\n1:57:03.720 --> 1:57:05.960\n particularly nicely, for both halves of the country.\n\n1:57:05.960 --> 1:57:08.320\n So that's the way you see it is,\n\n1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:09.720\n like the way I saw it,\n\n1:57:09.720 --> 1:57:11.520\n I guess I haven't looked carefully at it.\n\n1:57:11.520 --> 1:57:12.560\n I haven't either, to be fair.\n\n1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:13.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:13.600 --> 1:57:17.120\n The way I saw it is emphasizing centrists, which is.\n\n1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.200\n How is Tulsi a centrist?\n\n1:57:19.200 --> 1:57:20.040\n Tulsi was involved?\n\n1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:21.440\n Yes, he's trying to push Tulsi\n\n1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:23.280\n on like Jesse Ventura or something.\n\n1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:24.280\n Oh.\n\n1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:26.360\n So, okay, I don't know.\n\n1:57:26.360 --> 1:57:27.200\n I don't know the specifics.\n\n1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:28.880\n As a scientist, you also know centrism\n\n1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:30.560\n is not a coherent term in politics.\n\n1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:34.320\n But see, now you're like, what is it?\n\n1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:37.600\n Pleading to authority and my ego.\n\n1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:40.240\n No, no, I'm pleading to how you approach data.\n\n1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:42.680\n If someone is saying the mean is accurate,\n\n1:57:42.680 --> 1:57:45.040\n that only mean, I mean, the mean could be anywhere.\n\n1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:46.200\n It's a function of what's around it.\n\n1:57:46.200 --> 1:57:47.080\n That mean is true.\n\n1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.680\n I don't even know what centrists is supposed to mean,\n\n1:57:49.680 --> 1:57:54.680\n but what it means to me, there's no idea, a centrist.\n\n1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:58.600\n There's more of a center right or center left.\n\n1:57:58.600 --> 1:58:00.600\n To me, what that means is somebody\n\n1:58:00.600 --> 1:58:04.240\n who is a liberal or a conservative,\n\n1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:09.240\n but is open minded and empathetic to the other side.\n\n1:58:13.200 --> 1:58:15.600\n Joe Biden had the crime bill.\n\n1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:18.360\n Joe Biden voted for Republican Supreme Court justices.\n\n1:58:18.360 --> 1:58:19.920\n Joe Biden voted for a balanced budget.\n\n1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:21.760\n Joe Biden voted for Bush's war.\n\n1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:23.120\n And I'm sure probably I haven't looked this up,\n\n1:58:23.120 --> 1:58:23.960\n the Patriot Act.\n\n1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:26.040\n Joe, if you want a centrist, you have Joe Biden.\n\n1:58:26.040 --> 1:58:26.880\n Yeah, okay.\n\n1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:28.400\n He's worked very well with Republicans.\n\n1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:29.360\n That argument could be made.\n\n1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:33.440\n Of course, everybody will always resist that argument.\n\n1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:34.280\n It's indeniable.\n\n1:58:34.280 --> 1:58:35.920\n In fact, during the campaign,\n\n1:58:35.920 --> 1:58:40.840\n some activists started yelling at him at a town hall.\n\n1:58:40.840 --> 1:58:43.560\n Not yelling, just saying, hey, we need open borders.\n\n1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:45.520\n Joe Biden says, I'm not for open borders.\n\n1:58:45.520 --> 1:58:48.840\n Go vote for Trump and literally turn his back on the man.\n\n1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:50.200\n And this is during the primaries\n\n1:58:50.200 --> 1:58:53.960\n where it would behoove you to try to appeal to the base.\n\n1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:55.840\n And of course, you can probably also make the argument\n\n1:58:55.840 --> 1:58:59.240\n that Donald Trump is center right, if not center left.\n\n1:58:59.240 --> 1:59:04.200\n Well, I mean, he's very unique as a personality.\n\n1:59:04.200 --> 1:59:05.480\n But if you look at his record,\n\n1:59:05.480 --> 1:59:06.680\n and first of all, his rhetoric,\n\n1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:08.480\n you can say is not centrist at all.\n\n1:59:08.480 --> 1:59:10.480\n But in terms of how he governs,\n\n1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:13.480\n the budgeting, I mean, has been very moderate.\n\n1:59:13.480 --> 1:59:16.080\n It certainly hasn't been like draconian budget cuts.\n\n1:59:16.080 --> 1:59:18.320\n The Supreme Court, you could say, okay, he's hard right.\n\n1:59:18.320 --> 1:59:20.280\n Immigration, you could say in certain capacities,\n\n1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:21.160\n he's hard right.\n\n1:59:21.160 --> 1:59:24.520\n But in terms of pro life, what has he done there?\n\n1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:27.440\n In terms of, so in many other aspects,\n\n1:59:27.440 --> 1:59:30.720\n he's been very much this kind of me too Republican.\n\n1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:31.560\n But certainly the rhetoric,\n\n1:59:31.560 --> 1:59:33.720\n it's very hard to make him the case that he's a centrist.\n\n1:59:33.720 --> 1:59:35.160\n So you don't like,\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:37.840\n is there any other idea you find compelling?\n\n1:59:37.840 --> 1:59:41.720\n What I like about UND 2020 is it's an idea\n\n1:59:41.720 --> 1:59:46.200\n for a different way, for like a different party,\n\n1:59:46.200 --> 1:59:47.640\n a different path forward.\n\n1:59:47.640 --> 1:59:51.680\n So ideas, just like anarchy is an interesting idea\n\n1:59:51.680 --> 1:59:53.520\n that leads to discourse, that leads to.\n\n1:59:53.520 --> 1:59:54.600\n I don't think it's interesting at all.\n\n1:59:54.600 --> 1:59:56.560\n And here's why I don't think it's interesting.\n\n1:59:56.560 --> 1:59:59.920\n Sweden has eight parties in its parliament.\n\n1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:02.000\n Iceland, population is like 150,000.\n\n2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:03.280\n They've got nine, I think it was.\n\n2:00:03.280 --> 2:00:06.080\n Czech Republic has nine, Britain has five.\n\n2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:08.680\n So the claim that two parties\n\n2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:12.160\n is the censorious of speech,\n\n2:00:12.160 --> 2:00:14.200\n but three, oh, now all of a sudden,\n\n2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:16.640\n it makes no sense, doesn't port to the data, number one.\n\n2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:18.800\n Number two is Donald Trump demonstrated\n\n2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:21.080\n that you can be basically a third party candidate,\n\n2:00:21.080 --> 2:00:23.880\n sees the machinery of a existing party\n\n2:00:23.880 --> 2:00:27.080\n and appropriate to your own ends as Bernie Sanders.\n\n2:00:27.080 --> 2:00:29.320\n Bernie Sanders has never been a Democrat.\n\n2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:31.560\n Major credit to him for that's not easy\n\n2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:33.040\n to be elected as Senator as an independent.\n\n2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:34.200\n He's done it repeatedly.\n\n2:00:34.200 --> 2:00:37.440\n So these are two examples of ossified elites\n\n2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:38.280\n right for the picking.\n\n2:00:38.280 --> 2:00:42.880\n But to have a third party makes no real sense.\n\n2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:45.960\n Speaking of which, a party you talk about quite a bit.\n\n2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:52.000\n And let's look, this is a personal challenge to you.\n\n2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:55.520\n Let me bring up the Libertarian Party.\n\n2:00:55.520 --> 2:00:58.840\n And the personal challenge is to go five minutes\n\n2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:03.160\n without mocking them in discussing this idea.\n\n2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:05.160\n So first of all, what?\n\n2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:07.440\n I'm being trolled.\n\n2:01:07.440 --> 2:01:10.600\n Okay, I'm being trolled, okay, I'm being trolled.\n\n2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:13.320\n I'm being trolled, okay, this is good.\n\n2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:14.720\n Do you remember the fun friends?\n\n2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:16.000\n There was an episode where Chandler\n\n2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:17.560\n had to not make fun of people.\n\n2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:19.200\n Like, can you go one day Chandler?\n\n2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:22.800\n And Phoebe starts telling him about like this UFO she saw\n\n2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:26.440\n and he's like, that's very interesting and nice for you.\n\n2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:29.280\n This is exactly that.\n\n2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:31.120\n So a true master would be able to play\n\n2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:32.880\n within the game, within the constraints.\n\n2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:36.320\n So no, I'm pretty sure you'll still mock them.\n\n2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:38.480\n But no, no, I'll stick to the rules.\n\n2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:39.640\n Five minutes, easy.\n\n2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:42.680\n So first of all, speaking broadly about libertarianism,\n\n2:01:42.680 --> 2:01:44.840\n can you speak to that, how you feel about it?\n\n2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:47.000\n And then also to the Libertarian Party,\n\n2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.680\n which is the implementation of it in our current system.\n\n2:01:49.680 --> 2:01:53.720\n So I think libertarianism is a great idea.\n\n2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:56.000\n And I think there's many libertarian ideas\n\n2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.120\n that have become much more mainstream,\n\n2:01:58.120 --> 2:01:59.600\n which I'm very, very happy about.\n\n2:01:59.600 --> 2:02:02.280\n I remember there was an article in either New York\n\n2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:05.160\n or New Yorker Magazine in the early 90s,\n\n2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:06.720\n where they talked about the Cato Institute,\n\n2:02:06.720 --> 2:02:08.440\n which is a libertarian think tank.\n\n2:02:08.440 --> 2:02:11.960\n And they refer to the fact that Cato was against war\n\n2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:16.200\n and against like regulation with a wacky consistency,\n\n2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:18.560\n because they didn't know how to reconcile these two things.\n\n2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:19.520\n I don't remember what the two things were,\n\n2:02:19.520 --> 2:02:22.120\n but I remember that expression wacky consistency.\n\n2:02:22.120 --> 2:02:25.160\n And it wasn't even, we were all taught,\n\n2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:27.160\n and this is very much before the internet,\n\n2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:30.720\n that there's two tribes and if you're pro life,\n\n2:02:30.720 --> 2:02:32.480\n you have to hate gays.\n\n2:02:32.480 --> 2:02:34.960\n And if you're for socialized medicine,\n\n2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:39.760\n that also means you have to be for free speech.\n\n2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:42.080\n It was just this very, and like there's a whole menu\n\n2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:43.440\n and you got to sign it to all of them.\n\n2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:45.720\n And that menu is terrible.\n\n2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:47.480\n They hate America, they want to destroy it.\n\n2:02:47.480 --> 2:02:48.920\n Oh my God, those are horrible evil.\n\n2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:50.280\n This is the menu you want.\n\n2:02:50.280 --> 2:02:52.600\n And the Libertarian Party to some extent,\n\n2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:54.280\n and just libertarians as a whole said,\n\n2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:57.080\n you know, you can do the Chinese buffet\n\n2:02:57.080 --> 2:02:59.480\n and take a little from column A, a little from column B\n\n2:02:59.480 --> 2:03:03.840\n and have an ideology that is coherent and consistent,\n\n2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:07.600\n an ideology of peace and nonaggression\n\n2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:08.760\n and things like that.\n\n2:03:08.760 --> 2:03:12.600\n The Libertarian Party takes its model\n\n2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:15.240\n from like the early progressive and populist parties\n\n2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:16.680\n from the early 20th century,\n\n2:03:16.680 --> 2:03:18.400\n which were not very effective\n\n2:03:18.400 --> 2:03:20.840\n in terms of getting people elected,\n\n2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:23.240\n but were extremely effective\n\n2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:25.240\n in terms of getting the two major parties\n\n2:03:25.240 --> 2:03:27.960\n to appropriate and adopt their ideas and implement them.\n\n2:03:27.960 --> 2:03:30.440\n And in Britain as well, the liberal party got destroyed\n\n2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:32.200\n and became taken over by labor\n\n2:03:32.200 --> 2:03:34.840\n as the alternative party to the Tories\n\n2:03:34.840 --> 2:03:38.640\n and have those ideas basically become mainstreamed.\n\n2:03:38.640 --> 2:03:40.480\n So I think that, and the libertarian,\n\n2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:43.520\n my friend who passed away, Eric, I miss him dearly,\n\n2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:46.000\n was their webmaster and his whole point is,\n\n2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:47.680\n if you don't think of that in terms of a party,\n\n2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:49.080\n in terms of getting people elected,\n\n2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:50.320\n but if you think of it as a party\n\n2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:53.880\n in terms of getting people educated about alternatives,\n\n2:03:53.880 --> 2:03:55.800\n then there's enormous use for that.\n\n2:03:55.800 --> 2:03:56.720\n That was his perspective.\n\n2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.720\n And I don't think that's an absurd perspective.\n\n2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:00.160\n But here's some libertarian ideas\n\n2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:02.400\n that have become extremely mainstream.\n\n2:04:02.400 --> 2:04:04.720\n War should be a last resort.\n\n2:04:04.720 --> 2:04:07.120\n This is something we were taught as kids and we all say,\n\n2:04:07.120 --> 2:04:09.280\n but for many years, it's been like,\n\n2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:10.440\n they don't think of it as a last resort.\n\n2:04:10.440 --> 2:04:12.960\n It's like something's bad, well, it's like the first instinct.\n\n2:04:12.960 --> 2:04:15.480\n Now it's like, let's really give it a week, just a week.\n\n2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:16.800\n Like what's going on in Syria?\n\n2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:18.840\n Is there really gonna be a genocide, the Kurds?\n\n2:04:18.840 --> 2:04:19.680\n You know, things like that.\n\n2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:20.520\n So that's one.\n\n2:04:20.520 --> 2:04:22.880\n Another thing is drug legalization.\n\n2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:25.000\n This was, you know, when you and I were kids,\n\n2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:25.840\n oh, it's crazy.\n\n2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:27.240\n Only hippies wanna smoke pot.\n\n2:04:27.240 --> 2:04:30.000\n Now it's like, I was on a grand jury.\n\n2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.440\n And I'll point out what people make is,\n\n2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:35.960\n are you sure that the 16 year old who's selling weed,\n\n2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:39.640\n let's say selling, should his life be ruined?\n\n2:04:39.640 --> 2:04:41.920\n Should he be imprisoned with rapists and murderers?\n\n2:04:41.920 --> 2:04:44.800\n Like if you say yes, say yes,\n\n2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:48.880\n but you have to acknowledge that that's what you're meaning.\n\n2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:50.760\n And then a lot of people are like, wait a minute,\n\n2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:52.080\n there's gotta be a third option\n\n2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:54.720\n then he has no consequences or he's imprisoned\n\n2:04:54.720 --> 2:04:55.560\n with a rapist.\n\n2:04:55.560 --> 2:04:57.640\n I'm not comfortable with either of these.\n\n2:04:57.640 --> 2:05:01.160\n And I think the other one is an increasing skepticism.\n\n2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:02.800\n This libertarians were on top of this first\n\n2:05:02.800 --> 2:05:05.280\n and the hard left of the police.\n\n2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:08.360\n As of now, asset forfeiture steals more from people\n\n2:05:08.360 --> 2:05:09.200\n than burglaries.\n\n2:05:09.200 --> 2:05:11.320\n What people don't know about what asset forfeiture is,\n\n2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:13.840\n if the cops come to your house and they suspect you,\n\n2:05:13.840 --> 2:05:17.680\n you haven't been convicted of using your car or your house\n\n2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:19.960\n or whatever in terms of selling drugs,\n\n2:05:19.960 --> 2:05:22.440\n they can take whatever they want.\n\n2:05:22.440 --> 2:05:25.200\n And then you have to sue to prove your innocence\n\n2:05:25.200 --> 2:05:26.320\n and get your property back.\n\n2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:28.240\n It's a complete violation of due process.\n\n2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:29.480\n People don't realize it's going on.\n\n2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:31.880\n It's a great way for the cops to increase their budgets\n\n2:05:31.880 --> 2:05:32.960\n and it's legal.\n\n2:05:32.960 --> 2:05:35.640\n And libertarians were like the first big ones saying,\n\n2:05:35.640 --> 2:05:37.920\n guys, this is not American and this is crazy.\n\n2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:40.760\n And now increasingly people on conservatives and leftists\n\n2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:42.680\n like, wait a minute, this is...\n\n2:05:42.680 --> 2:05:44.640\n Even if you are selling drugs, like they take your house,\n\n2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:45.800\n what are you talking about?\n\n2:05:45.800 --> 2:05:49.240\n So I think those are some mechanisms that libertarianism,\n\n2:05:49.240 --> 2:05:52.560\n though not by name, has become far more popular.\n\n2:05:52.560 --> 2:05:55.960\n Yeah, it's interesting, so the idea, yeah, a coherent set\n\n2:05:55.960 --> 2:06:00.120\n of ideas that eventually get integrated\n\n2:06:00.120 --> 2:06:01.240\n into a two party system.\n\n2:06:01.240 --> 2:06:02.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:03.200\n The war, that's an interesting one.\n\n2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:04.040\n You're right.\n\n2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:07.400\n I wonder what the thread there is.\n\n2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:11.080\n I wonder how it connects to 9 11 and so on.\n\n2:06:11.080 --> 2:06:13.800\n I think the Patriot Act.\n\n2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:14.640\n Patriot Act, okay.\n\n2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:16.800\n For people who are politically savvy,\n\n2:06:16.800 --> 2:06:20.720\n we're like, oh, okay, this is not a joke.\n\n2:06:20.720 --> 2:06:24.120\n This is really a crazy infringement of our freedoms\n\n2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:27.040\n and both parties are falling over each other\n\n2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:30.320\n to sign into law and the Orwellian name.\n\n2:06:30.320 --> 2:06:31.160\n You don't wanna...\n\n2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:32.400\n How can you be against patriotism?\n\n2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:33.240\n What kind of person?\n\n2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:34.080\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:06:34.080 --> 2:06:34.920\n So I think for a lot of people,\n\n2:06:34.920 --> 2:06:37.240\n especially both civil libertarians on the left\n\n2:06:37.240 --> 2:06:39.400\n and a lot of conservatives who are constitutionalists\n\n2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:41.000\n are like, wait a minute, this isn't...\n\n2:06:41.000 --> 2:06:42.280\n I'm not comfortable with this.\n\n2:06:42.280 --> 2:06:44.120\n And I'm also not comfortable with how comfortable everyone\n\n2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:45.680\n in Washington is with it.\n\n2:06:45.680 --> 2:06:48.760\n You're right, probably libertarians\n\n2:06:48.760 --> 2:06:52.160\n and libertarianism is a place of ideas,\n\n2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:53.960\n which is why I have a connection to it.\n\n2:06:57.560 --> 2:07:00.400\n Every time I listen to those folks, I like them.\n\n2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:01.520\n I feel connected to them.\n\n2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:03.440\n I would even sometimes, depending on the day,\n\n2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:05.200\n call myself a libertarian.\n\n2:07:05.200 --> 2:07:06.600\n Well, we're all the spectrum, so that's why.\n\n2:07:06.600 --> 2:07:08.280\n We're all on the spectrum, yeah.\n\n2:07:08.280 --> 2:07:12.480\n But when I look at the people that actually rise to the top\n\n2:07:12.480 --> 2:07:15.600\n in terms of the people who represent the party,\n\n2:07:15.600 --> 2:07:18.120\n this is where five minutes ran out, right?\n\n2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:19.760\n I could go, I'm allowed.\n\n2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:22.320\n You can go, why are they so weird?\n\n2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:26.800\n Why aren't strong candidates emerging\n\n2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:31.800\n that represent as political representatives\n\n2:07:31.880 --> 2:07:36.880\n or as famous speakers that represent ideology?\n\n2:07:38.120 --> 2:07:40.320\n I think libertarians tend to...\n\n2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:43.040\n I think Jonathan Haidt in his book, in his research,\n\n2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:45.000\n he's a political scientist and he does a lot of things\n\n2:07:45.000 --> 2:07:46.720\n about how people come to their political inclusions\n\n2:07:46.720 --> 2:07:50.840\n and what factors force people to reach conclusions.\n\n2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:53.640\n And he found that libertarians are the least empathetic\n\n2:07:53.640 --> 2:07:56.120\n and most rationalistic of all the groups.\n\n2:07:56.120 --> 2:07:58.120\n And by that, he means like they think in terms of logic\n\n2:07:58.120 --> 2:07:59.640\n as opposed to like people's feelings\n\n2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:02.060\n and that has positives and has negatives.\n\n2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:07.120\n And we have the A, B testing with Ron Paul.\n\n2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:10.600\n Ron Paul ran for president as a libertarian nominee.\n\n2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:11.680\n He was the nominee.\n\n2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:14.040\n He got pretty much nowhere in 1988.\n\n2:08:14.040 --> 2:08:16.080\n Then he ran as a return to the Republican party\n\n2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:18.040\n as a congressman for many years from Texas.\n\n2:08:18.040 --> 2:08:22.480\n He ran for the presidency in 2008 and 2012.\n\n2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:26.560\n And in 2008, he stood on stage with Rudy Giuliani\n\n2:08:26.560 --> 2:08:29.080\n and told him that they were here in 9 11\n\n2:08:29.080 --> 2:08:30.360\n because we're over there,\n\n2:08:30.360 --> 2:08:33.840\n which would have been a shocking, horrifying taboo\n\n2:08:33.840 --> 2:08:35.080\n a few years earlier.\n\n2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:37.320\n Many people were like, holy crap, this is amazing.\n\n2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:39.160\n Giuliani was all offended and Ron Paul's like...\n\n2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:40.640\n I took some guts by the way.\n\n2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:41.940\n Yeah, you did.\n\n2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:44.160\n When I heard that, it was so refreshing.\n\n2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:47.200\n Not what he said, but the fact that he said something\n\n2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:48.280\n that took guts.\n\n2:08:48.280 --> 2:08:53.280\n It made me realize how rare it is for politicians,\n\n2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:56.040\n but even people to say something that takes guts.\n\n2:08:56.040 --> 2:08:58.680\n Well, it's also the idea that like you can't,\n\n2:08:58.680 --> 2:09:01.120\n even if you think America has a right\n\n2:09:01.120 --> 2:09:03.980\n to invade any country on earth as much as it wants\n\n2:09:03.980 --> 2:09:06.540\n and kill people as a consequence of war\n\n2:09:06.540 --> 2:09:09.360\n and blow up their buildings and destroy their country,\n\n2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:11.040\n you can't with a straight face\n\n2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:13.800\n not expect us to have consequences,\n\n2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:15.940\n even if they're consequences from evil people.\n\n2:09:15.940 --> 2:09:17.620\n Even if we're 100% of the good guys\n\n2:09:17.620 --> 2:09:19.060\n and they're 100% of the bad guys,\n\n2:09:19.060 --> 2:09:21.080\n those bad guys, some of them are still gonna try\n\n2:09:21.080 --> 2:09:22.300\n to do something.\n\n2:09:22.300 --> 2:09:23.480\n What happens next?\n\n2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:24.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:27.360\n So that kind of concept that there's any American\n\n2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:30.960\n culpability, we're America, we are the good guys\n\n2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:32.400\n by definition, we're not culpable,\n\n2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:34.120\n to have people start thinking about\n\n2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:35.520\n what if there's another way?\n\n2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:37.120\n You know, what if we're not there\n\n2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:38.080\n and then they're not here\n\n2:09:38.080 --> 2:09:39.600\n and we're kind of doing a backdoor,\n\n2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:41.840\n we're talking so different scenarios.\n\n2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:44.560\n So the fact that he got so much more traction\n\n2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:47.560\n as a Republican, the fact that Donald Trump\n\n2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:50.680\n who came out of nowhere became not only the candidate,\n\n2:09:50.680 --> 2:09:52.980\n but the president tells people,\n\n2:09:52.980 --> 2:09:54.840\n it's like getting a book deal, right?\n\n2:09:54.840 --> 2:09:57.460\n You can either go, there's three choices.\n\n2:09:57.460 --> 2:10:00.540\n You can either self publish, mainstream publisher\n\n2:10:00.540 --> 2:10:03.200\n or independent publisher.\n\n2:10:03.200 --> 2:10:05.920\n The independent publisher is the worst of all choices\n\n2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:07.960\n because you're not getting a big advance,\n\n2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:10.580\n they're not gonna be able to promote you a lot\n\n2:10:10.580 --> 2:10:12.920\n and they don't get the distribution.\n\n2:10:12.920 --> 2:10:15.480\n Mainstream, I've done mainstream and self, right?\n\n2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:18.280\n With self, I don't have the cred,\n\n2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:20.560\n the respectability of a mainstream or the cache.\n\n2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.640\n It can be a New York Times bestseller.\n\n2:10:22.640 --> 2:10:24.340\n Right, it takes a lot of work,\n\n2:10:24.340 --> 2:10:26.980\n but I get a lot more of the profit.\n\n2:10:26.980 --> 2:10:28.640\n If it looks good on the shelf on Amazon,\n\n2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:30.420\n it looks identical, so on and so forth.\n\n2:10:30.420 --> 2:10:32.420\n With the mainstream, the benefits and costs\n\n2:10:32.420 --> 2:10:34.320\n are pretty much obvious to most people.\n\n2:10:34.320 --> 2:10:35.780\n So the same thing, it's like you can either\n\n2:10:35.780 --> 2:10:37.840\n be an independent like Ross Perot\n\n2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:41.180\n or you could be, just seize one of the party apparatus,\n\n2:10:41.180 --> 2:10:42.880\n which the benefits are enormous there.\n\n2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:45.160\n But in terms of going third party,\n\n2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:47.080\n I don't know the libertarian party apparatus\n\n2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:48.880\n other than maybe some ballot access\n\n2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:50.720\n is really that efficacious.\n\n2:10:50.720 --> 2:10:52.600\n And then you're gonna have a lot of baggage.\n\n2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.080\n Cause if you hear independent, Jesse Ventura, Ross Perot,\n\n2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:57.400\n you think of the person.\n\n2:10:57.400 --> 2:10:59.360\n Now you have to define yourself\n\n2:10:59.360 --> 2:11:01.200\n and you have to defend the party.\n\n2:11:01.200 --> 2:11:03.160\n That's two bridges for most people.\n\n2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:08.160\n So, brilliantly put, okay, let me speak to you.\n\n2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:12.240\n Cause I'm speaking to Yaron Brooks soon.\n\n2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:13.080\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:14.180 --> 2:11:15.020\n I like him.\n\n2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:19.140\n Yeah, so, but that, another example, I was.\n\n2:11:19.140 --> 2:11:21.480\n Ask him to tell you a joke about Ayn Rand,\n\n2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:22.400\n if he can do it.\n\n2:11:23.820 --> 2:11:26.900\n So there, that's one criticism I've heard you say,\n\n2:11:26.900 --> 2:11:30.980\n which is they're unable to speak to any weaknesses\n\n2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:34.320\n in either Ayn Rand's or objectivist worldview.\n\n2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:35.280\n Yes.\n\n2:11:35.280 --> 2:11:38.320\n That's really, well, you put it,\n\n2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:39.620\n I know you're half joking,\n\n2:11:39.620 --> 2:11:43.320\n but that's actually a legitimate discussion to have.\n\n2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:44.440\n I'm not joking at all.\n\n2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:47.520\n Because that's, to me, one of the criticisms\n\n2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:49.280\n and one of the explanations why the world\n\n2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:53.640\n seems to disrespect Ayn Rand, the people that do,\n\n2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:58.640\n is she kind of implies that her ideas are like flawless.\n\n2:11:58.640 --> 2:12:01.380\n No, she says they correspond to reality.\n\n2:12:01.380 --> 2:12:02.260\n Yeah, right.\n\n2:12:02.260 --> 2:12:03.620\n That's the term she uses.\n\n2:12:03.620 --> 2:12:08.260\n That, I mean, objectivist, it's in the name.\n\n2:12:08.260 --> 2:12:10.980\n It's, you know, it's just facts.\n\n2:12:10.980 --> 2:12:14.140\n Like, it's impossible to basically argue against\n\n2:12:14.140 --> 2:12:16.780\n cause it's pretty simple, it's just all facts.\n\n2:12:16.780 --> 2:12:18.340\n Well, that's, it's possible to argue against,\n\n2:12:18.340 --> 2:12:20.820\n but she would say she's never met a good critic\n\n2:12:20.820 --> 2:12:22.900\n who can argue the facts out of misrepresentation.\n\n2:12:22.900 --> 2:12:24.100\n And she's not entirely wrong.\n\n2:12:24.100 --> 2:12:25.140\n She's often caricatured,\n\n2:12:25.140 --> 2:12:26.860\n cause she has a very extreme personality\n\n2:12:26.860 --> 2:12:28.180\n and extreme worldview.\n\n2:12:28.180 --> 2:12:30.060\n But that to me, I mean, some people,\n\n2:12:30.060 --> 2:12:32.700\n there's a guy named in the physics mathematics community\n\n2:12:32.700 --> 2:12:34.660\n called Stephen Wolfram.\n\n2:12:34.660 --> 2:12:35.500\n I don't know if you've heard of him.\n\n2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:36.340\n Wolfram Malfoy?\n\n2:12:36.340 --> 2:12:37.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:38.000\n Okay.\n\n2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:39.700\n He has a similar style of speaking sometimes,\n\n2:12:39.700 --> 2:12:44.180\n which is like, I've created a science,\n\n2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:46.540\n but that turns a lot of people off,\n\n2:12:46.540 --> 2:12:48.820\n like this kind of weird confidence.\n\n2:12:48.820 --> 2:12:50.420\n But he's one of my favorite people,\n\n2:12:50.420 --> 2:12:52.520\n I think one of the most brilliant people.\n\n2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:56.060\n If you just ignore that little bit of ego\n\n2:12:56.060 --> 2:12:57.900\n or whatever you call that,\n\n2:12:57.900 --> 2:12:59.620\n that there are some beautiful ideas in there.\n\n2:12:59.620 --> 2:13:03.420\n And that, for me, objectivism,\n\n2:13:03.420 --> 2:13:06.380\n I'm undereducated about it.\n\n2:13:06.380 --> 2:13:08.380\n I hope to be more educated,\n\n2:13:08.380 --> 2:13:10.420\n but there's some interesting ideas that,\n\n2:13:10.420 --> 2:13:12.300\n again, just like with UFOs,\n\n2:13:14.300 --> 2:13:15.460\n not that there's a connection between the two.\n\n2:13:15.460 --> 2:13:16.460\n Don't bring that up for your own.\n\n2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:17.300\n He won't like it.\n\n2:13:17.300 --> 2:13:18.140\n He won't.\n\n2:13:18.140 --> 2:13:19.100\n My friends like UFOs.\n\n2:13:19.100 --> 2:13:21.180\n Oh, no, no, no, this interview is over.\n\n2:13:21.180 --> 2:13:24.060\n That's a good yarn.\n\n2:13:24.060 --> 2:13:25.180\n Okay.\n\n2:13:25.180 --> 2:13:27.500\n But you know, you have to be a little bit open minded,\n\n2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:31.500\n but what's your sense of objectivism?\n\n2:13:31.500 --> 2:13:32.780\n Are there interesting ideas\n\n2:13:32.780 --> 2:13:35.580\n that are useful to you to think about?\n\n2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:38.420\n I own her copy of the first printing of The Fountainhead.\n\n2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:39.620\n So that should tell you a little bit\n\n2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.540\n about how my affection for Ms. Rand,\n\n2:13:41.540 --> 2:13:42.760\n how heavy that goes.\n\n2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:46.000\n Ayn Rand does not have all the answers,\n\n2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.660\n but she has all the questions.\n\n2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:49.060\n So if you study Rand,\n\n2:13:49.060 --> 2:13:50.900\n you are going to be forced to think through\n\n2:13:50.900 --> 2:13:52.140\n some very basic things,\n\n2:13:52.140 --> 2:13:54.920\n and you're gonna have your eyes open very, very heavily.\n\n2:13:54.920 --> 2:13:56.060\n She was not perfect.\n\n2:13:56.060 --> 2:13:57.340\n She never claimed to be perfect.\n\n2:13:57.340 --> 2:13:59.460\n She was asked on Donahue,\n\n2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:01.260\n is it true that according to your philosophy,\n\n2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:02.500\n you are a perfect being?\n\n2:14:02.500 --> 2:14:05.100\n She said, I never think of myself that way.\n\n2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:06.460\n And she said, but if you asked me,\n\n2:14:06.460 --> 2:14:07.580\n do I practice what I preach?\n\n2:14:07.580 --> 2:14:10.220\n The answer is yes, resoundingly.\n\n2:14:10.220 --> 2:14:12.320\n She's a fascinating woman.\n\n2:14:13.340 --> 2:14:15.480\n What is really interesting about her,\n\n2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:17.820\n and this is something you'd appreciate personally,\n\n2:14:17.820 --> 2:14:19.380\n is when you read her essays,\n\n2:14:19.380 --> 2:14:21.740\n she'll have these weird asides.\n\n2:14:21.740 --> 2:14:23.020\n And it looked like she was talking about art,\n\n2:14:23.020 --> 2:14:24.220\n and she'd be like, and this is why the US\n\n2:14:24.220 --> 2:14:25.900\n should be the only country with nuclear weapons.\n\n2:14:25.900 --> 2:14:28.220\n And when you follow a brilliant mind\n\n2:14:28.220 --> 2:14:31.340\n making these seemingly disparate connections,\n\n2:14:31.340 --> 2:14:33.660\n it's something I find to be just absolutely inspiring\n\n2:14:33.660 --> 2:14:35.180\n and awesome and entertaining.\n\n2:14:36.140 --> 2:14:38.500\n I think there's lots of things about her\n\n2:14:38.500 --> 2:14:40.900\n that people like Yaron would make uncomfortable.\n\n2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:45.420\n Well, like she, they,\n\n2:14:45.420 --> 2:14:47.660\n so objectivism, like any other philosophy,\n\n2:14:47.660 --> 2:14:50.860\n has all these techniques to kind of hand wave away things\n\n2:14:50.860 --> 2:14:52.820\n you don't wanna talk about and like pretend it.\n\n2:14:52.820 --> 2:14:54.380\n So they talk about things like having\n\n2:14:54.380 --> 2:14:57.020\n no metaphysical significance, right?\n\n2:14:57.020 --> 2:14:58.620\n So what that means is like, well, what about this?\n\n2:14:58.620 --> 2:14:59.700\n Ah, I don't wanna talk about it.\n\n2:14:59.700 --> 2:15:00.620\n Like it doesn't matter.\n\n2:15:00.620 --> 2:15:02.900\n Like it literally means in fancy philosophical terms,\n\n2:15:02.900 --> 2:15:03.860\n it doesn't matter.\n\n2:15:03.860 --> 2:15:06.120\n Or they will say correctly,\n\n2:15:06.120 --> 2:15:09.580\n that it's very twisted in our culture\n\n2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:12.520\n that when we have heroes, we look for their flaws\n\n2:15:12.520 --> 2:15:13.940\n instead of looking for their virtues.\n\n2:15:13.940 --> 2:15:16.420\n That's a hundred percent valid perspective.\n\n2:15:16.420 --> 2:15:19.540\n However, if I'm sitting here telling you\n\n2:15:19.540 --> 2:15:22.020\n that I think this woman is a badass,\n\n2:15:22.020 --> 2:15:24.660\n and she's amazing and she should be studied,\n\n2:15:24.660 --> 2:15:26.640\n but there's also these idiosyncrasies,\n\n2:15:26.640 --> 2:15:27.900\n they don't wanna hear it.\n\n2:15:27.900 --> 2:15:30.340\n Because they, and I think it's very convenient for them\n\n2:15:30.340 --> 2:15:32.220\n because there's a lot of things she did that were,\n\n2:15:32.220 --> 2:15:33.380\n here's an example.\n\n2:15:33.380 --> 2:15:36.720\n Rand was very, very pro happiness and pleasure.\n\n2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.420\n She was very pro sex, which is kind of surprising\n\n2:15:39.420 --> 2:15:41.820\n looking at her and how she talked and how strident she was.\n\n2:15:41.820 --> 2:15:45.000\n As a result of this, she never got her cats fixed\n\n2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:46.960\n to deny them the pleasure of orgasm.\n\n2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:50.000\n So her male cats are spraying up her entire house.\n\n2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:53.420\n Like that is, I mean, that's her putting her philosophy\n\n2:15:53.420 --> 2:15:55.900\n into practice, but it's still gross.\n\n2:15:55.900 --> 2:15:58.180\n So that's the kind of thing where I don't think he'd be,\n\n2:15:58.180 --> 2:16:01.940\n another thing is Rand had an article on a woman president\n\n2:16:01.940 --> 2:16:04.500\n and she said a woman should never be president, right?\n\n2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:06.980\n Now, when Rand says things that are too goofy for them,\n\n2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:09.660\n they say, oh, that's not objectivism,\n\n2:16:09.660 --> 2:16:11.160\n that's her personal preference.\n\n2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:14.360\n It's like, she did not have these lines.\n\n2:16:14.360 --> 2:16:18.200\n Objectivism was always defined as Ayn Rand's writings,\n\n2:16:18.200 --> 2:16:20.180\n plus the additional essays in her books.\n\n2:16:20.180 --> 2:16:22.240\n So if this was in part of those books,\n\n2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:24.060\n this counts as official objectivism,\n\n2:16:24.060 --> 2:16:25.220\n but they pretend otherwise.\n\n2:16:25.220 --> 2:16:26.420\n So that's another example.\n\n2:16:26.420 --> 2:16:30.140\n Plus she was, and I bet you she was on the spectrum\n\n2:16:30.140 --> 2:16:31.300\n to some extent, I'm not joking,\n\n2:16:31.300 --> 2:16:32.700\n I'm not using that derisively.\n\n2:16:32.700 --> 2:16:36.460\n She was of the belief and not inaccurately,\n\n2:16:36.460 --> 2:16:40.900\n because that humor is used to denigrate and humiliate.\n\n2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:42.660\n And she was thinking about the Jon Stewart type\n\n2:16:42.660 --> 2:16:43.860\n before there was a Jon Stewart.\n\n2:16:43.860 --> 2:16:46.540\n And a lot of times, like how I use mocking,\n\n2:16:46.540 --> 2:16:49.340\n but she was resentful, correctly,\n\n2:16:49.340 --> 2:16:51.880\n that a lot of times people who are great and accomplished,\n\n2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:54.940\n little nobodies will make a punchline\n\n2:16:54.940 --> 2:16:56.700\n just to bring them down and despise her.\n\n2:16:56.700 --> 2:16:58.140\n Here's an example I just thought of.\n\n2:16:58.140 --> 2:17:01.140\n I remember when it was, must have been the 90s,\n\n2:17:01.140 --> 2:17:04.740\n they had a segment on MTV of all these musicians\n\n2:17:04.740 --> 2:17:07.460\n who were making their own perfumes, right?\n\n2:17:07.460 --> 2:17:09.340\n And this girl grabbed Prince's perfume,\n\n2:17:09.340 --> 2:17:11.100\n and before she even smelled it, she had the joke ready.\n\n2:17:11.100 --> 2:17:13.220\n She goes, oh, this smells almost as bad\n\n2:17:13.220 --> 2:17:14.380\n as his music lately.\n\n2:17:14.380 --> 2:17:16.300\n It's like, first of all, I'm sure the perfume's fine.\n\n2:17:16.300 --> 2:17:18.140\n And second of all, this is Prince.\n\n2:17:18.140 --> 2:17:19.700\n He's one of the all time greats,\n\n2:17:19.700 --> 2:17:22.820\n and you can't wait to denigrate him.\n\n2:17:22.820 --> 2:17:25.660\n And part, I wanna be like, how dare you?\n\n2:17:25.660 --> 2:17:29.380\n Like as if this perfume in any way,\n\n2:17:29.380 --> 2:17:32.020\n in any way mitigates his amazing accomplishments\n\n2:17:32.020 --> 2:17:34.060\n and achievements, you horrible person.\n\n2:17:34.060 --> 2:17:36.580\n But I do have some great Ayn Rand jokes,\n\n2:17:36.580 --> 2:17:38.500\n and he would not be happy about them.\n\n2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.980\n The perfume thing, the problem with it is just not funny.\n\n2:17:40.980 --> 2:17:43.460\n Oh, he sucks, okay, great.\n\n2:17:43.460 --> 2:17:47.380\n Not that they dared to try to be humorous,\n\n2:17:47.380 --> 2:17:48.780\n because I don't know why you mentioned John,\n\n2:17:48.780 --> 2:17:50.460\n because John Stewart can be funny.\n\n2:17:50.460 --> 2:17:53.260\n Right, but he taught a generation,\n\n2:17:53.260 --> 2:17:55.060\n you still see this on Twitter,\n\n2:17:55.060 --> 2:17:58.900\n where things have to be inherently sarcastic and snide.\n\n2:17:58.900 --> 2:18:00.900\n But isn't that, I mean, aren't you practicing that?\n\n2:18:00.900 --> 2:18:02.740\n No, I use irony, not sarcasm.\n\n2:18:02.740 --> 2:18:03.580\n Here's an example.\n\n2:18:03.580 --> 2:18:05.180\n When people, like you say something,\n\n2:18:05.180 --> 2:18:07.000\n and someone replied, it'd be like,\n\n2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:08.740\n last I checked, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n2:18:08.740 --> 2:18:09.860\n and I'll say that, I go,\n\n2:18:09.860 --> 2:18:12.060\n what do you think saying last I checked added to your point?\n\n2:18:12.060 --> 2:18:14.500\n You're giving me valuable information and data,\n\n2:18:14.500 --> 2:18:16.440\n but you are trained to believe\n\n2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:19.460\n that it has to be couched in this sneering.\n\n2:18:19.460 --> 2:18:21.140\n It doesn't, just give me the information.\n\n2:18:21.140 --> 2:18:22.460\n This is useful information.\n\n2:18:22.460 --> 2:18:24.060\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n2:18:24.060 --> 2:18:24.940\n It's a knee jerk.\n\n2:18:24.940 --> 2:18:27.060\n But see, John Stewart did it masterfully.\n\n2:18:27.060 --> 2:18:28.060\n Correct, and they don't.\n\n2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:30.860\n And they don't, it's like people who copy comedians,\n\n2:18:30.860 --> 2:18:34.840\n certain comedians, you try to copy them\n\n2:18:34.840 --> 2:18:37.060\n and use everything in the process of copying.\n\n2:18:37.060 --> 2:18:40.120\n Yeah, yep, okay.\n\n2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:44.920\n But in terms of the philosophy of selfishness,\n\n2:18:44.920 --> 2:18:47.880\n this kind of individual focused idea,\n\n2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:50.860\n and I imagine that connects with you.\n\n2:18:50.860 --> 2:18:52.960\n Yes, and I think it would connect with more people\n\n2:18:52.960 --> 2:18:54.300\n if they understood what she meant by it.\n\n2:18:54.300 --> 2:18:55.800\n Nathaniel Brandon, who was her heir\n\n2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:57.160\n until she kind of broke with him,\n\n2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:00.400\n and he was a co dedicatee of Atlas Shrugged,\n\n2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:04.200\n said no one will say Ayn Rand's views with a straight face.\n\n2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:08.200\n They won't say, I believe that my happiness matters\n\n2:19:08.200 --> 2:19:10.480\n and is important and is worth fighting for,\n\n2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:13.040\n and that Ayn Rand says this, then she's dangerous.\n\n2:19:13.040 --> 2:19:14.560\n Now, it's very easy to say\n\n2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:16.340\n this could have dangerous consequences\n\n2:19:16.340 --> 2:19:17.600\n if you're a sociopath,\n\n2:19:17.600 --> 2:19:21.220\n but to put it in those terms, I think is extremely healthy.\n\n2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:23.000\n I think more people should wanna be happy.\n\n2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:26.640\n And I think a lot of us are raised to be apologetic,\n\n2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:29.360\n especially in this cynical media culture,\n\n2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:32.400\n that if you say, I wanna be happy, I wanna love my life,\n\n2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:34.240\n that it's just like, okay, sweetheart.\n\n2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:35.680\n And the eye rolling,\n\n2:19:35.680 --> 2:19:37.960\n and I think that's so pernicious and so horrifying,\n\n2:19:37.960 --> 2:19:39.480\n this is why I'm a Camus person,\n\n2:19:39.480 --> 2:19:41.400\n because Camus thought the archenemy was cynicism\n\n2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:42.840\n and I could not agree more.\n\n2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:44.080\n Like if you're the kind of person,\n\n2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:45.400\n if someone likes a band and you're like,\n\n2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:46.600\n oh, you like them, blah, blah, blah,\n\n2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:49.160\n it's like, this gives them happiness.\n\n2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:50.000\n Now, there's certain exceptions,\n\n2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:52.360\n but if it gives you happiness, it's not for you,\n\n2:19:52.360 --> 2:19:53.240\n that's cool.\n\n2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.800\n Okay, this is beautiful.\n\n2:19:55.800 --> 2:19:59.340\n I so agree with you on the eye rolling,\n\n2:19:59.340 --> 2:20:04.100\n but you see the best of trolling as not the eye roll.\n\n2:20:04.100 --> 2:20:05.320\n Correct, of course not.\n\n2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:08.920\n The best of trolling is taking down the eye rollers.\n\n2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:10.120\n I'm gonna have to think about that.\n\n2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:10.960\n Okay.\n\n2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:11.780\n Because I kind of.\n\n2:20:11.780 --> 2:20:12.620\n Have another Red Bull.\n\n2:20:12.620 --> 2:20:15.660\n Yeah, I was, yeah.\n\n2:20:15.660 --> 2:20:16.500\n Because I put them all.\n\n2:20:16.500 --> 2:20:17.660\n My blood type is Red Bull.\n\n2:20:20.880 --> 2:20:22.800\n I kind of put them all in the same bin.\n\n2:20:22.800 --> 2:20:23.640\n Okay.\n\n2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:24.460\n And they're not.\n\n2:20:24.460 --> 2:20:25.300\n They're not.\n\n2:20:25.300 --> 2:20:26.140\n They're not.\n\n2:20:26.140 --> 2:20:26.960\n Okay, all right.\n\n2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:29.160\n Here's another example of trolling.\n\n2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:30.600\n I was making jokes about Ron Paul,\n\n2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:32.720\n he just had a stroke, right?\n\n2:20:32.720 --> 2:20:35.080\n And someone came at me and they're like,\n\n2:20:35.080 --> 2:20:36.000\n blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:37.440\n You know, you're ugly.\n\n2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:38.520\n I hope you have a stroke.\n\n2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:39.440\n I hope you're in the hospital.\n\n2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:42.280\n And I just go, I just did have a stroke on your mom's face.\n\n2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:46.000\n So they came at me and now they got put in their place.\n\n2:20:47.040 --> 2:20:50.320\n With a subpar, I mean.\n\n2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:51.280\n I wasn't clever.\n\n2:20:51.280 --> 2:20:52.400\n You weren't clever.\n\n2:20:52.400 --> 2:20:53.640\n Not particularly, no.\n\n2:20:53.640 --> 2:20:57.000\n Well, one of your things you do, which is interesting,\n\n2:20:57.000 --> 2:20:59.280\n I mean, I give you props in a sense,\n\n2:20:59.280 --> 2:21:03.840\n is you're willing to go farther than people expect you to.\n\n2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:05.180\n Yes, that's fun.\n\n2:21:05.180 --> 2:21:06.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:21:06.020 --> 2:21:09.480\n In fact, I'll probably edit out like half of this podcast\n\n2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:12.560\n because the thing you did, which she kept in,\n\n2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:15.920\n should mention, is Michaela Peterson now has a podcast,\n\n2:21:15.920 --> 2:21:16.840\n which is nice.\n\n2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:18.400\n I guess, was it on her podcast?\n\n2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:19.220\n She was on mine.\n\n2:21:19.220 --> 2:21:20.060\n She was on yours.\n\n2:21:20.060 --> 2:21:21.400\n We did both, but this is when you're referring\n\n2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:22.400\n to when she was on mine.\n\n2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:23.560\n She was on, yeah, right.\n\n2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:27.880\n And you went right for the, for the.\n\n2:21:27.880 --> 2:21:29.040\n So I'll tell you what it was.\n\n2:21:29.040 --> 2:21:29.880\n You don't have to paraphrase.\n\n2:21:29.880 --> 2:21:32.560\n I opened up, I say, you know, she's Jordan Peterson's dad.\n\n2:21:32.560 --> 2:21:36.200\n And as many people know, sorry, he's her dad, yeah.\n\n2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:39.880\n He's had a long issue with substance addiction.\n\n2:21:39.880 --> 2:21:42.800\n And I said to her, you're most famous\n\n2:21:42.800 --> 2:21:45.360\n for being Jordan Peterson's daughter.\n\n2:21:45.360 --> 2:21:48.160\n Many people, he's changed so many lives around the world.\n\n2:21:48.160 --> 2:21:51.720\n And he's been such an enormous influence to me personally\n\n2:21:51.720 --> 2:21:54.760\n that I've started taking benzodiazepines recreationally.\n\n2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:58.520\n And she's like, oh my God, Michael, it's so horrible.\n\n2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:01.140\n Yeah, because you pulled me in with this,\n\n2:22:01.140 --> 2:22:02.920\n cause you're talking, I mean, you know,\n\n2:22:02.920 --> 2:22:04.360\n cause he's going through a rough time.\n\n2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:07.400\n Now she's going through just everything was just,\n\n2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:08.920\n you pulled me in emotionally.\n\n2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:11.560\n I was like, this is going to be the sweet,\n\n2:22:11.560 --> 2:22:14.640\n Mike is going to be just this wonderful.\n\n2:22:14.640 --> 2:22:16.080\n And then just bam.\n\n2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:21.000\n So that's, that's, that's, that was props to you on that.\n\n2:22:21.000 --> 2:22:24.720\n It wasn't, whatever that is, that is an art form\n\n2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:27.800\n when done well, it can be taken too far.\n\n2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:32.800\n My criticism is it, that feels too good for some people.\n\n2:22:33.160 --> 2:22:34.000\n What do you mean?\n\n2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.960\n Oh, they're too happy being a reverend\n\n2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:37.320\n cause to show that they don't care about anything.\n\n2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:38.960\n That's another form of cynicism though.\n\n2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:42.440\n Right, so I, cause you think it's possible to be a troll\n\n2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:46.960\n and still be the live life to its highest ideal\n\n2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:48.080\n in the Camus sense.\n\n2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:51.080\n I try, that's kind of my ideal.\n\n2:22:51.080 --> 2:22:55.840\n I believe it's not, it becomes a drug.\n\n2:22:55.840 --> 2:22:57.080\n I feel like that takes you,\n\n2:22:57.080 --> 2:23:01.860\n like I think love ultimately is the way to experience\n\n2:23:01.860 --> 2:23:04.240\n like every moment of every day.\n\n2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:06.800\n You don't think that was an expression of,\n\n2:23:06.800 --> 2:23:09.680\n I honestly think, let's split hairs here\n\n2:23:09.680 --> 2:23:12.080\n cause I think this is something of use here.\n\n2:23:12.080 --> 2:23:14.400\n I do think that me,\n\n2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:18.560\n me being able to make her laugh\n\n2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:21.240\n about this year of hell she was in\n\n2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:23.380\n does create an element of love\n\n2:23:23.380 --> 2:23:25.080\n and connection between me and her.\n\n2:23:25.080 --> 2:23:28.080\n Yeah, but I know she would say that.\n\n2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:30.800\n Yes, it wasn't that.\n\n2:23:30.800 --> 2:23:33.600\n It was what you said in combination\n\n2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:37.460\n with the sweetness everywhere else, the kindness.\n\n2:23:37.460 --> 2:23:38.960\n It's a very subtle thing,\n\n2:23:38.960 --> 2:23:41.960\n but like, it's like some of the deepest connection\n\n2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:46.040\n we have with others is when we like mock them lovingly.\n\n2:23:46.040 --> 2:23:46.940\n Yes, correct.\n\n2:23:46.940 --> 2:23:51.800\n But like there is stuff, there's kindness around that.\n\n2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:53.000\n Sometimes it's not in words,\n\n2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:55.180\n but in like subtle things.\n\n2:23:55.180 --> 2:23:58.760\n Cause it creates an air of being familial.\n\n2:23:58.760 --> 2:23:59.760\n Like we're through this together.\n\n2:23:59.760 --> 2:24:02.480\n Yeah, that's missing,\n\n2:24:02.480 --> 2:24:04.380\n that's very difficult to do on the internet.\n\n2:24:04.380 --> 2:24:05.740\n I agree with you.\n\n2:24:05.740 --> 2:24:06.580\n I agree with you.\n\n2:24:06.580 --> 2:24:10.700\n That's why my general approach on the internet\n\n2:24:10.700 --> 2:24:15.240\n is to be more like simple, less witty\n\n2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:19.320\n and more like dumbly loving.\n\n2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:23.080\n But that's not your core competency being witty.\n\n2:24:23.080 --> 2:24:25.280\n Uh, me?\n\n2:24:25.280 --> 2:24:26.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:27.800\n But I can be witty.\n\n2:24:27.800 --> 2:24:29.760\n You can be, but I'm saying that's not your core competency.\n\n2:24:29.760 --> 2:24:30.860\n I'm not saying you're bad at it,\n\n2:24:30.860 --> 2:24:33.720\n but I'm saying that's not where you go like organically,\n\n2:24:34.600 --> 2:24:36.800\n especially with strangers.\n\n2:24:36.800 --> 2:24:40.200\n I just feel like nobody's core competence on the internet\n\n2:24:40.200 --> 2:24:43.320\n is I guess if you want to bring love to the world,\n\n2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:47.840\n nobody's core competence is given the current platforms,\n\n2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:50.360\n nobody's core competence is wit.\n\n2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:52.560\n It's very difficult to be witty on the internet\n\n2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:55.460\n without while still communicating kindness.\n\n2:24:55.460 --> 2:24:59.520\n Like in the same way that you can in physical space.\n\n2:24:59.520 --> 2:25:00.400\n I'll give you another example.\n\n2:25:00.400 --> 2:25:03.920\n Someone came at me and they were like,\n\n2:25:03.920 --> 2:25:04.880\n they gave me a donation.\n\n2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:06.200\n People do this all the time.\n\n2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:09.800\n And they go, oh, like I started reading your books\n\n2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:11.480\n cause of my wife and you know,\n\n2:25:11.480 --> 2:25:14.980\n now watch your shows together, keep up the good work.\n\n2:25:14.980 --> 2:25:17.440\n And I go, what does her boyfriend think?\n\n2:25:17.440 --> 2:25:20.440\n So that is an example of wit and love\n\n2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:23.000\n because that person feels seen.\n\n2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:24.320\n I'm acknowledging them.\n\n2:25:24.320 --> 2:25:25.880\n I'm also making a joke at their expense.\n\n2:25:25.880 --> 2:25:27.280\n We know it's a joke.\n\n2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:31.960\n So I think language is often used in nonliteral ways\n\n2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:34.100\n to cue emotional and connectivity.\n\n2:25:34.100 --> 2:25:37.060\n It's difficult, but what you've done\n\n2:25:37.060 --> 2:25:39.600\n is difficult to accomplish, but you've done it well.\n\n2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:43.320\n I mean, you've been doing these live streams,\n\n2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:45.200\n which are nice that people give you a bunch of money\n\n2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:46.440\n and donations and stuff.\n\n2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:49.040\n And then you, you'll often like make fun\n\n2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:51.040\n of certain aspects of their questions and so on,\n\n2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:52.200\n but it's always lovely.\n\n2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:53.040\n That's not from love.\n\n2:25:53.040 --> 2:25:53.880\n That is genuine annoyance\n\n2:25:53.880 --> 2:25:54.700\n cause they ask me some really dumb questions.\n\n2:25:54.700 --> 2:25:57.840\n But they're still underlying, it's not even,\n\n2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:00.400\n like there's a kind person under that\n\n2:26:00.400 --> 2:26:02.280\n that's being communicated.\n\n2:26:02.280 --> 2:26:03.120\n That's interesting.\n\n2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:05.640\n But I don't know if I get that from your Twitter.\n\n2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:07.520\n I know I get that from the video,\n\n2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:09.560\n something about the face, something about like,\n\n2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:10.400\n Yeah, of course.\n\n2:26:10.400 --> 2:26:11.220\n The physical presentation.\n\n2:26:11.220 --> 2:26:13.440\n The more data, the more easy it is\n\n2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:15.160\n to convey emotion and subtlety.\n\n2:26:15.160 --> 2:26:17.200\n Absolutely, if you only have literally black and white\n\n2:26:17.200 --> 2:26:19.000\n letters, it's going to be, or whatever,\n\n2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:20.640\n white and black, if you have night mode,\n\n2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:21.720\n it's going to be a very different,\n\n2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:23.640\n it's much more limited information.\n\n2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:26.640\n Yeah, but this is the fundamental thing is like,\n\n2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:28.560\n Here's another example.\n\n2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:30.180\n Like if they had access to my face,\n\n2:26:30.180 --> 2:26:32.240\n like a lot of times some people don't know who I am\n\n2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:34.840\n and they come at me, call me a Nazi antisemite, right?\n\n2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:36.240\n And I start talking about the Jews\n\n2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:37.840\n and just how terrible the Jews are.\n\n2:26:37.840 --> 2:26:39.360\n Now all my audience knows I'm Jewish\n\n2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:40.200\n that I went to yeshiva.\n\n2:26:40.200 --> 2:26:41.480\n So they're sitting there laughing\n\n2:26:41.480 --> 2:26:43.440\n cause this person is making ass of themselves.\n\n2:26:43.440 --> 2:26:44.880\n That person has no idea.\n\n2:26:44.880 --> 2:26:47.440\n But if there was video, then they would be like,\n\n2:26:47.440 --> 2:26:48.760\n okay, wait a minute, something's up.\n\n2:26:48.760 --> 2:26:49.900\n Yeah, something's up.\n\n2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:51.840\n I don't know.\n\n2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:53.760\n I think it's entertaining.\n\n2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:57.400\n I think it's fun, but I just, I don't think it's scalable.\n\n2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:00.240\n And ultimately, I'm trying to figure out\n\n2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:01.960\n this whole trolling thing.\n\n2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:03.880\n Cause I think it's really destructive.\n\n2:27:04.780 --> 2:27:08.920\n I've been the outrage mob, the outrage mobs,\n\n2:27:08.920 --> 2:27:12.640\n just the dynamics of Twitter has been really bothering me.\n\n2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:13.480\n Okay.\n\n2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:17.000\n I've been trying to figure out if we can try to build\n\n2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:19.800\n an alternative to Twitter perhaps\n\n2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:22.140\n or try to encourage Twitter to be better,\n\n2:27:22.140 --> 2:27:25.720\n how to have nuanced, healthy conversations.\n\n2:27:25.720 --> 2:27:28.840\n Like the reason I talk about love isn't just for love's sake.\n\n2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:31.840\n It's just a good base from which to have\n\n2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:33.020\n difficult conversations.\n\n2:27:33.020 --> 2:27:34.520\n Like that's a good starting point.\n\n2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:38.720\n Because if you start, like I would argue that\n\n2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:42.600\n the kind of conversation you have on Twitter is fun,\n\n2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:44.640\n but it might not be a good starting point\n\n2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:46.640\n for a difficult, nuanced conversation.\n\n2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:48.200\n Well, I'm not interested in having\n\n2:27:48.200 --> 2:27:49.800\n those conversations with most people.\n\n2:27:49.800 --> 2:27:50.880\n No, I know, but.\n\n2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:52.200\n So I agree with you.\n\n2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:53.080\n Your point is valid.\n\n2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:56.680\n Yes, but like I'm saying, so if we were trying to have\n\n2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:58.960\n a difficult, nuanced conversation\n\n2:27:58.960 --> 2:28:02.320\n about say race in America or policing,\n\n2:28:02.320 --> 2:28:06.320\n is there institutional racism of policing?\n\n2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:07.160\n Okay.\n\n2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:10.800\n There's the only conversations that have been nuanced\n\n2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.680\n about it that I've heard is in the podcasting medium.\n\n2:28:13.680 --> 2:28:14.520\n I agree with you.\n\n2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:17.000\n Which is the magic of podcasting, which is great.\n\n2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:21.160\n But that's the downside of podcasting\n\n2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:24.200\n is it's a very small number of people.\n\n2:28:24.200 --> 2:28:27.680\n Even if it's in the thousands, it's still small.\n\n2:28:27.680 --> 2:28:30.360\n And then there's millions of people on social media\n\n2:28:30.360 --> 2:28:32.920\n and they're not having nuanced conversation at all.\n\n2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:34.040\n They're not capable of it.\n\n2:28:34.040 --> 2:28:35.120\n That's the difference in your thoughts.\n\n2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:35.960\n They have no minds.\n\n2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:36.800\n I believe they are.\n\n2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:37.620\n So that's the.\n\n2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:38.460\n There's no data that shows this.\n\n2:28:38.460 --> 2:28:41.560\n Both of us aren't being not scientific.\n\n2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:43.400\n You don't have data to support your world either.\n\n2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:44.640\n You're making the claim.\n\n2:28:45.640 --> 2:28:46.680\n Well, you are too.\n\n2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:47.500\n No, I'm not.\n\n2:28:47.500 --> 2:28:51.000\n If I'm looking at an object, the claim that it has in mind.\n\n2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:51.840\n Well.\n\n2:28:53.080 --> 2:28:54.660\n No, what?\n\n2:28:54.660 --> 2:28:58.120\n No, your claim is that people are fundamentally stupid.\n\n2:28:58.120 --> 2:28:59.680\n Are you a martial artist?\n\n2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:01.200\n Yes.\n\n2:29:01.200 --> 2:29:02.140\n How's it feel?\n\n2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:05.000\n I just judo on you.\n\n2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:05.840\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:10.120\n But you really don't think people are deep down\n\n2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:13.480\n like capable of being intelligent.\n\n2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:14.880\n No, not at all.\n\n2:29:14.880 --> 2:29:16.000\n Not deep down, not surface.\n\n2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:16.840\n I'm not joking.\n\n2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:18.000\n I'm not being tongue in cheek.\n\n2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:18.860\n I'm not being cynical.\n\n2:29:18.860 --> 2:29:22.320\n I do not at all think they have this capacity.\n\n2:29:22.320 --> 2:29:23.160\n I'm gonna think.\n\n2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:24.580\n Cause you're being so clear about it.\n\n2:29:24.580 --> 2:29:25.420\n You're not even.\n\n2:29:26.280 --> 2:29:27.120\n I'm gonna have to think about that.\n\n2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:27.960\n You know why?\n\n2:29:27.960 --> 2:29:31.400\n Here's evidence for my position, not proof.\n\n2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:33.740\n And this is of course data that is of little use,\n\n2:29:33.740 --> 2:29:34.960\n but it's of interest.\n\n2:29:34.960 --> 2:29:37.220\n A lot of times when you have an audience as big as mine\n\n2:29:37.220 --> 2:29:38.760\n and people come at you,\n\n2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:42.080\n not only will people say the same thing, the same concept,\n\n2:29:42.080 --> 2:29:44.360\n they'll say the same concept in the same way.\n\n2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:45.580\n That is not a mind.\n\n2:29:46.740 --> 2:29:47.580\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:47.580 --> 2:29:49.280\n That's surface evidence.\n\n2:29:49.280 --> 2:29:52.680\n You're saying this iceberg looks like this from the surface.\n\n2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:54.300\n I'm saying there's an iceberg there\n\n2:29:54.300 --> 2:29:58.300\n that if challenged can rise to the occasion\n\n2:30:01.400 --> 2:30:04.200\n of deep thinking and you're saying.\n\n2:30:04.200 --> 2:30:05.040\n Nope.\n\n2:30:05.040 --> 2:30:05.960\n Nope.\n\n2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:07.120\n It's just frozen water.\n\n2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:10.580\n Isn't that the Russian expression?\n\n2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:12.840\n That's ice cream.\n\n2:30:12.840 --> 2:30:13.680\n No, not.\n\n2:30:14.600 --> 2:30:17.360\n Doesn't it mean like no one's there?\n\n2:30:17.360 --> 2:30:18.180\n Actually, I don't know.\n\n2:30:18.180 --> 2:30:19.800\n Yeah, it means like, yeah.\n\n2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:20.880\n Yeah, it's like thought.\n\n2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:21.720\n It means.\n\n2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:26.320\n Okay.\n\n2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:28.360\n Well, so you're challenging me\n\n2:30:28.360 --> 2:30:29.960\n to be a little bit more rigorous.\n\n2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:30.800\n I think I'll try.\n\n2:30:30.800 --> 2:30:31.920\n I'm not challenging you anything.\n\n2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:32.760\n I'm just saying.\n\n2:30:32.760 --> 2:30:33.580\n No, not challenging me,\n\n2:30:33.580 --> 2:30:35.720\n but like I'm challenging myself based on what you're saying\n\n2:30:35.720 --> 2:30:37.900\n because I'd like to prove you wrong\n\n2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:42.400\n and find actual data to show you're wrong.\n\n2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:46.400\n And I think I can, but I would need to get that data.\n\n2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:47.720\n That's funny you said, I think I can.\n\n2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:50.700\n When they were working on my biography, Ego and Hubris,\n\n2:30:50.700 --> 2:30:52.200\n the title I had suggested was\n\n2:30:52.200 --> 2:30:54.160\n The Little Engine That Could But Shouldn't.\n\n2:30:54.160 --> 2:30:57.320\n And they didn't like it.\n\n2:30:57.320 --> 2:30:58.600\n I think that's a great title.\n\n2:30:58.600 --> 2:31:00.160\n That's pretty good, yeah.\n\n2:31:00.160 --> 2:31:01.720\n Speaking of biographies, I mean,\n\n2:31:01.720 --> 2:31:04.080\n I read your book or listened to your book.\n\n2:31:04.080 --> 2:31:04.920\n Listened to.\n\n2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:05.920\n There's an audio book from you, right?\n\n2:31:05.920 --> 2:31:06.960\n Yeah, I did the audio, yeah.\n\n2:31:06.960 --> 2:31:08.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:08.920\n You read it?\n\n2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:10.160\n My Golis, yes.\n\n2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:11.000\n Okay.\n\n2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:12.360\n So this was a.\n\n2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:14.120\n I didn't do Yaron Brooks voice in the book.\n\n2:31:14.120 --> 2:31:15.160\n I did all the different voices\n\n2:31:15.160 --> 2:31:16.000\n because he has a lisp\n\n2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:18.120\n and I didn't want to sound like I was making fun of him.\n\n2:31:19.120 --> 2:31:21.540\n Yeah, I don't remember you reading it,\n\n2:31:21.540 --> 2:31:23.520\n but I was really enjoyed it.\n\n2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:24.360\n No, okay.\n\n2:31:24.360 --> 2:31:25.180\n It was good.\n\n2:31:25.180 --> 2:31:26.240\n It was like a year, a year and a half ago.\n\n2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:27.380\n This I can prove.\n\n2:31:27.380 --> 2:31:28.220\n It's just.\n\n2:31:30.780 --> 2:31:32.260\n Well, let me at a high level,\n\n2:31:32.260 --> 2:31:33.660\n see if you can pull this off.\n\n2:31:33.660 --> 2:31:38.660\n If I ask you, what's the book you write about?\n\n2:31:38.920 --> 2:31:42.740\n It's about a group of people\n\n2:31:42.740 --> 2:31:46.740\n who are united solely by their opposition to progressivism,\n\n2:31:46.740 --> 2:31:49.080\n who have little else in common,\n\n2:31:49.080 --> 2:31:53.380\n but who are all frequently caricatured and dismissed\n\n2:31:53.380 --> 2:31:56.400\n by the larger establishment media.\n\n2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:00.220\n But you give this kind of story of how it came to be.\n\n2:32:00.220 --> 2:32:01.060\n Sure.\n\n2:32:01.060 --> 2:32:03.540\n And to me, like we're talking about trolls,\n\n2:32:03.540 --> 2:32:06.860\n but the internet side of things is quite interesting.\n\n2:32:06.860 --> 2:32:10.020\n So first of all, how does alt right connect?\n\n2:32:10.020 --> 2:32:13.960\n So the alt right is the subset of the new right,\n\n2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:16.780\n which feels that race, not racism,\n\n2:32:16.780 --> 2:32:19.620\n is the most or one of the most important\n\n2:32:19.620 --> 2:32:21.200\n socio political issues.\n\n2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:26.200\n Are any of those folks like part of the mainstream\n\n2:32:27.240 --> 2:32:29.240\n or worth paying attention to?\n\n2:32:29.240 --> 2:32:30.420\n None of them are part of the mainstream.\n\n2:32:30.420 --> 2:32:32.220\n The alt right, by definition,\n\n2:32:32.220 --> 2:32:33.800\n they would be part of the mainstream.\n\n2:32:33.800 --> 2:32:34.920\n They would not be part of them.\n\n2:32:34.920 --> 2:32:36.160\n No, they would not.\n\n2:32:36.160 --> 2:32:38.640\n I don't know that any of them.\n\n2:32:38.640 --> 2:32:40.000\n Well, worth is not a position.\n\n2:32:40.000 --> 2:32:41.840\n I'm not in a position to say worth.\n\n2:32:41.840 --> 2:32:45.360\n I would say that it is of use\n\n2:32:45.360 --> 2:32:48.200\n to be familiar with their arguments\n\n2:32:48.200 --> 2:32:51.320\n because to dismiss any school of thought,\n\n2:32:51.320 --> 2:32:54.680\n especially one that has historically gained leverage,\n\n2:32:54.680 --> 2:32:57.020\n especially one that has historically gained leverage\n\n2:32:57.020 --> 2:32:59.520\n in very dark ways, especially in America,\n\n2:32:59.520 --> 2:33:01.200\n in Europe and other places,\n\n2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:03.080\n just to say, oh, they're racist.\n\n2:33:03.080 --> 2:33:04.340\n I don't need to think about them.\n\n2:33:04.340 --> 2:33:07.220\n It doesn't behoove you.\n\n2:33:07.220 --> 2:33:12.220\n So what lessons do we draw from the 4chan side of things,\n\n2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:16.200\n like the internet side of the movement?\n\n2:33:16.200 --> 2:33:19.000\n Tits or get the fuck out.\n\n2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.120\n Can you define every single word in there?\n\n2:33:21.120 --> 2:33:24.080\n Tits or breasts or get the fuck out.\n\n2:33:24.080 --> 2:33:25.520\n That's from 4chan.\n\n2:33:25.520 --> 2:33:28.160\n Okay, what's it mean?\n\n2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:29.960\n Oh, sometimes like a woman will appear in 4chan\n\n2:33:29.960 --> 2:33:32.200\n and they'll just reply, tits or get the fuck out.\n\n2:33:34.480 --> 2:33:35.640\n I'm trying to understand what that,\n\n2:33:35.640 --> 2:33:37.240\n oh, oh, that's a way.\n\n2:33:41.400 --> 2:33:44.360\n I just, very slow.\n\n2:33:44.360 --> 2:33:47.680\n Oh, so that's, okay, so that's very disrespectful\n\n2:33:47.680 --> 2:33:52.520\n towards female members of the community.\n\n2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:53.600\n I don't understand.\n\n2:33:53.600 --> 2:33:55.080\n There's rules to this community\n\n2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:58.760\n and one of them is we're not very good with women.\n\n2:33:58.760 --> 2:33:59.600\n Is that, that's one of the rules?\n\n2:33:59.600 --> 2:34:02.280\n It's more of a principle than a rule.\n\n2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:04.080\n It's a principle?\n\n2:34:04.080 --> 2:34:06.240\n We're not going to ever get laid.\n\n2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:07.900\n That's fundamentally the principle.\n\n2:34:07.900 --> 2:34:08.740\n Is there other principles?\n\n2:34:08.740 --> 2:34:10.240\n But we are gonna get pics.\n\n2:34:10.240 --> 2:34:11.080\n Pics.\n\n2:34:11.080 --> 2:34:11.900\n Sometimes.\n\n2:34:11.900 --> 2:34:12.740\n Sometimes on the internet.\n\n2:34:12.740 --> 2:34:15.120\n Sometimes they GTFO.\n\n2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:19.120\n Okay, so is there other actual principles of,\n\n2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:24.360\n so like it's, from my maybe naive perspective\n\n2:34:24.360 --> 2:34:26.660\n is they have like the darkest aspects of trolling,\n\n2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:28.780\n which is like take nothing serious,\n\n2:34:28.780 --> 2:34:30.440\n make a game out of everything.\n\n2:34:30.440 --> 2:34:31.840\n That's not 4chan per se.\n\n2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:34.200\n One of the things that you will learn in 4chan,\n\n2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:35.880\n which I think is very healthy,\n\n2:34:35.880 --> 2:34:39.500\n is if you have an idiosocratic or unique worldview\n\n2:34:39.500 --> 2:34:42.020\n or focus on an aspect of history or culture,\n\n2:34:42.020 --> 2:34:43.760\n you'll be able to find like minded people\n\n2:34:43.760 --> 2:34:45.400\n who you will engage with you and discuss it\n\n2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:48.120\n without being preemptively dismissive.\n\n2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.000\n That's an ideal that they.\n\n2:34:51.000 --> 2:34:51.840\n Well, it's not ideal.\n\n2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:52.840\n It's something that happens a lot.\n\n2:34:52.840 --> 2:34:53.880\n Now 4chan's not really,\n\n2:34:53.880 --> 2:34:56.480\n like Paul is their board with politics,\n\n2:34:56.480 --> 2:34:59.000\n but they will get into some,\n\n2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.880\n like the people there are much more erudite than you'd think.\n\n2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:03.080\n So they do take,\n\n2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:05.260\n my perception was they take nothing seriously.\n\n2:35:05.260 --> 2:35:07.360\n So there's things that they take seriously,\n\n2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:08.640\n like discussing ideas.\n\n2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:09.620\n I'll give you one example.\n\n2:35:09.620 --> 2:35:11.280\n There was a video someone posted\n\n2:35:11.280 --> 2:35:13.200\n of a girl who put kittens in a bag\n\n2:35:13.200 --> 2:35:14.420\n and threw it in a river.\n\n2:35:14.420 --> 2:35:16.080\n And they found out where she was within a day\n\n2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:17.500\n and got her like arrested.\n\n2:35:17.500 --> 2:35:19.920\n So yeah, they do take some things very seriously.\n\n2:35:20.960 --> 2:35:21.800\n Okay.\n\n2:35:21.800 --> 2:35:24.200\n But that's like an extreme that,\n\n2:35:24.200 --> 2:35:25.080\n I mean, that's good.\n\n2:35:25.080 --> 2:35:26.200\n First of all, that's heartwarming\n\n2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:29.440\n that they wouldn't somehow turn that into a thing.\n\n2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:31.780\n That feels like more of a, what is it?\n\n2:35:31.780 --> 2:35:32.620\n What's the other one?\n\n2:35:32.620 --> 2:35:33.440\n 8chan?\n\n2:35:33.440 --> 2:35:36.020\n 8chan's twice as good as 4chan, yeah.\n\n2:35:36.020 --> 2:35:36.960\n That's their slogan.\n\n2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:40.500\n But it feels like they're the kind of community\n\n2:35:40.500 --> 2:35:43.520\n that would take that kitten situation\n\n2:35:43.520 --> 2:35:45.080\n and make a mockery of it.\n\n2:35:45.080 --> 2:35:47.440\n Yeah, they're darker than 4chan.\n\n2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:50.180\n I don't even, I'm not allowed to talk about 16chan.\n\n2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:55.600\n I'm already overwhelmed clearly by 4chan lingo.\n\n2:35:57.000 --> 2:35:58.900\n I literally wrote down in my notes,\n\n2:36:00.960 --> 2:36:04.400\n like in doing research for this conversation,\n\n2:36:04.400 --> 2:36:05.900\n I learned the word pleb.\n\n2:36:06.920 --> 2:36:09.440\n And I wanted to ask you what this pleb means.\n\n2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:10.480\n Do you know what pleb means?\n\n2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:11.320\n No.\n\n2:36:13.480 --> 2:36:16.280\n I saw, I mean, actually, no, I don't.\n\n2:36:16.280 --> 2:36:17.720\n You know what a pleb is?\n\n2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:20.080\n I just, I don't know what a pleb is.\n\n2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:22.300\n Like a plebiscite or plebeian.\n\n2:36:22.300 --> 2:36:23.140\n Okay.\n\n2:36:23.140 --> 2:36:25.900\n But does it mean something more sophisticated?\n\n2:36:27.080 --> 2:36:29.060\n No, it's a very unsophisticated mechanism\n\n2:36:29.060 --> 2:36:30.700\n of being dismissive.\n\n2:36:30.700 --> 2:36:32.760\n Of like the regular people.\n\n2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:35.300\n Yeah, or someone who comes at me on Twitter.\n\n2:36:35.300 --> 2:36:36.140\n Okay.\n\n2:36:36.140 --> 2:36:39.360\n All right, so back to the 4chan alt right.\n\n2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:40.400\n Wasn't the...\n\n2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:41.720\n Those are very different concepts.\n\n2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:43.560\n Don't conflate them.\n\n2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:48.560\n But which internet culture was the alt right born out of?\n\n2:36:48.720 --> 2:36:51.180\n Well, alt right was more born of blogs.\n\n2:36:51.180 --> 2:36:53.440\n And people had different blogs that were posting\n\n2:36:53.440 --> 2:36:55.080\n what they call like racial realism,\n\n2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:57.520\n which is scientific racism, so called.\n\n2:36:57.520 --> 2:37:00.440\n And breaking down issues from a racialist perspective.\n\n2:37:00.440 --> 2:37:03.760\n So that wasn't, 4chan is much more dynamic.\n\n2:37:03.760 --> 2:37:04.760\n It's a message board.\n\n2:37:04.760 --> 2:37:06.600\n It's very fluid.\n\n2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:08.040\n So it doesn't lend itself\n\n2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:11.560\n to these kind of in depth analysis of ideas or history.\n\n2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:12.800\n But it spreads them.\n\n2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:13.640\n Like it...\n\n2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:15.200\n It spreads them as memes, yeah.\n\n2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:16.360\n And you know, but...\n\n2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:18.520\n But it's not an essential mechanism\n\n2:37:18.520 --> 2:37:20.800\n of the alt right, historically?\n\n2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:22.320\n No, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:24.160\n So it was mostly about blogs.\n\n2:37:24.160 --> 2:37:28.040\n Okay, so what do you make of the psychology\n\n2:37:28.040 --> 2:37:29.600\n of this kind of worldview?\n\n2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:30.440\n When you have...\n\n2:37:30.440 --> 2:37:33.840\n This goes to your conspiracy theory subject earlier.\n\n2:37:33.840 --> 2:37:36.460\n When you have a little bit of knowledge about something,\n\n2:37:36.460 --> 2:37:39.000\n about history that no one's talking about,\n\n2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.160\n and there's only one group that is talking about it,\n\n2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:45.340\n and you have no alternative answers,\n\n2:37:45.340 --> 2:37:47.300\n you're going to be drawn to that group.\n\n2:37:47.300 --> 2:37:51.600\n So because issues about race, anti semitism, homophobia\n\n2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:53.880\n are so taboo in our culture,\n\n2:37:53.880 --> 2:37:55.320\n understandably there's good reasons.\n\n2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:56.560\n If you start putting things like,\n\n2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:58.680\n how old should you be to have sex with kids\n\n2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:00.120\n and just have regular conversations,\n\n2:38:00.120 --> 2:38:01.280\n eventually some people are gonna start\n\n2:38:01.280 --> 2:38:02.520\n taking some positions you don't like.\n\n2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:04.600\n So some things have to be sanctified to some extent.\n\n2:38:04.600 --> 2:38:06.440\n They're the only ones talking about it.\n\n2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:09.260\n You're gonna be drawn to that subculture.\n\n2:38:10.640 --> 2:38:13.080\n And where does the alt right stand now?\n\n2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:15.360\n I mean, I hear that term used...\n\n2:38:15.360 --> 2:38:18.320\n So the term has been weaponized by the corporate press\n\n2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:22.440\n for people that they want to read out of society.\n\n2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:24.320\n So it's used both on individual levels,\n\n2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:27.360\n like people like Gavin McIngus, Milo Yiannopoulos,\n\n2:38:27.360 --> 2:38:28.760\n some others.\n\n2:38:28.760 --> 2:38:31.780\n I mean, I think they've referred to Trump as alt right.\n\n2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:36.600\n And it's become a slur, just like incel or bot,\n\n2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:39.720\n that has become largely removed from its original meaning.\n\n2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:41.840\n Do you have a sense that there's still a movement\n\n2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:43.000\n that's alt right or like...\n\n2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.440\n Yeah, they call themselves now...\n\n2:38:44.440 --> 2:38:47.440\n Okay, so there's something called the dissonant right.\n\n2:38:47.440 --> 2:38:49.720\n And they say, we're completely not like the alt right\n\n2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:53.180\n because the alt right's A, B, and C, and we're B, C, D.\n\n2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:54.420\n There's a huge overlap.\n\n2:38:54.420 --> 2:38:56.080\n It's very much the same people.\n\n2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.200\n Is there intellectuals that still represent\n\n2:38:59.200 --> 2:39:01.360\n some aspect of the movement?\n\n2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:02.400\n I mean, sure.\n\n2:39:02.400 --> 2:39:03.240\n Are you tracking this?\n\n2:39:03.240 --> 2:39:05.200\n Not that much anymore.\n\n2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:06.920\n I think they're...\n\n2:39:06.920 --> 2:39:09.160\n I don't find it particularly as...\n\n2:39:10.360 --> 2:39:12.240\n Now that the book's done,\n\n2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:15.840\n I'm looking more into history for my next book.\n\n2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:16.920\n You mentioned communism?\n\n2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:19.620\n I'm gonna talk a lot about the Cold War.\n\n2:39:19.620 --> 2:39:22.040\n So this kind of stuff has largely fallen away\n\n2:39:22.040 --> 2:39:24.000\n from my radar to some extent.\n\n2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:27.080\n And it's been a very effective movement\n\n2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:29.720\n to get them marginalized and silenced.\n\n2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:32.920\n So they're not as deep of a concern\n\n2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:34.520\n in terms of concern or not,\n\n2:39:34.520 --> 2:39:36.480\n just their impact on society.\n\n2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:38.440\n Yes, it's much lessened, yeah.\n\n2:39:38.440 --> 2:39:42.220\n So as a troll on Twitter, in the best sense of the word,\n\n2:39:42.220 --> 2:39:45.120\n what do you make of cancel culture?\n\n2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:47.400\n I think it's Maoism.\n\n2:39:47.400 --> 2:39:50.160\n I mean, corporate America has done a far better job\n\n2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:52.640\n of implementing Maoism than the communist party ever could.\n\n2:39:52.640 --> 2:39:54.320\n You had this meeting not that long ago\n\n2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:56.520\n from I think it was Northwestern University Law School\n\n2:39:56.520 --> 2:39:57.920\n where everyone on the call got up\n\n2:39:57.920 --> 2:39:59.420\n and said that they were racist.\n\n2:39:59.420 --> 2:40:01.160\n I mean, this is something that legally\n\n2:40:01.160 --> 2:40:02.920\n you should be very averse to saying,\n\n2:40:02.920 --> 2:40:04.240\n even if it were true.\n\n2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:06.500\n And it's this kind of concept of getting up\n\n2:40:06.500 --> 2:40:08.780\n and confessing your sins before the collective\n\n2:40:08.780 --> 2:40:10.360\n is something completely.\n\n2:40:12.200 --> 2:40:14.160\n Oh, sorry, they admitted this of themselves?\n\n2:40:14.160 --> 2:40:15.080\n Yeah, they were like,\n\n2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:16.200\n because they're saying because they're white,\n\n2:40:16.200 --> 2:40:17.040\n they're inherently racist.\n\n2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:18.560\n So my name's John, I'm a racist.\n\n2:40:18.560 --> 2:40:20.360\n My name's this, I'm a racist.\n\n2:40:20.360 --> 2:40:22.720\n You hear it and you're like, okay, this is Looney Tunes.\n\n2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:25.240\n So you're saying that, wow, that's so much,\n\n2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:26.440\n you took a step further.\n\n2:40:26.440 --> 2:40:30.040\n So you're saying there's like a deep underlying force\n\n2:40:30.040 --> 2:40:31.720\n that cancels culture.\n\n2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:33.560\n It's not just some kind of mob.\n\n2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:35.060\n Well, it's not a mob at all.\n\n2:40:35.060 --> 2:40:40.060\n It's a systemic organized movement being used\n\n2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:42.320\n for very nefarious purposes\n\n2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:44.300\n and to dominate an entire nation.\n\n2:40:45.160 --> 2:40:46.120\n How do we fight it?\n\n2:40:46.120 --> 2:40:48.520\n Because I sense it inside.\n\n2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:51.520\n You know, I used to defend academia more\n\n2:40:51.520 --> 2:40:56.520\n because I still do to some extent.\n\n2:40:58.480 --> 2:41:02.000\n It's a nuanced discussion because, you know,\n\n2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:03.840\n like folks like Jordan Peterson\n\n2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:06.800\n and a lot of people that kind of attack academia,\n\n2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:10.220\n they refer, they really are talking about gender studies\n\n2:41:10.220 --> 2:41:11.280\n at certain departments.\n\n2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:13.960\n And me from MIT, you know,\n\n2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:15.820\n it's the University of Science and Engineering\n\n2:41:15.820 --> 2:41:20.820\n and the faculty there really don't think\n\n2:41:20.820 --> 2:41:24.060\n about these issues or haven't traditionally thought of,\n\n2:41:24.060 --> 2:41:26.260\n but it's beginning to even infiltrate there.\n\n2:41:26.260 --> 2:41:30.700\n It's the, you know, it's starting to infiltrate engineering\n\n2:41:30.700 --> 2:41:32.500\n and sciences outside of biology.\n\n2:41:32.500 --> 2:41:35.360\n Like let's put biology with the gender studies.\n\n2:41:35.360 --> 2:41:36.980\n Like I'm talking about sciences\n\n2:41:36.980 --> 2:41:40.140\n that really don't have anything to do with gender.\n\n2:41:40.140 --> 2:41:44.720\n It's starting to infiltrate and it worries me.\n\n2:41:45.580 --> 2:41:46.700\n I don't know exactly why,\n\n2:41:46.700 --> 2:41:49.560\n like I don't know exactly what the negative effect\n\n2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:54.560\n there would be, except it feels like it's anti intellectual.\n\n2:41:55.780 --> 2:41:57.340\n Oh yes, of course.\n\n2:41:57.340 --> 2:41:59.020\n And I'm not sure what to,\n\n2:41:59.020 --> 2:42:02.260\n because on the surface,\n\n2:42:02.260 --> 2:42:05.340\n it feels like a path towards progress.\n\n2:42:05.340 --> 2:42:08.740\n At first, when I'm like zoomed out, you know,\n\n2:42:08.740 --> 2:42:11.700\n just like squinting my eyes, you know,\n\n2:42:11.700 --> 2:42:13.940\n not even in detail looking at things,\n\n2:42:13.940 --> 2:42:15.780\n but when I actually joined the conversation\n\n2:42:15.780 --> 2:42:20.320\n to like listen in the conversation on quote unquote diversity,\n\n2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:23.820\n it quickly makes me realize\n\n2:42:23.820 --> 2:42:28.820\n that there's no interest in making a better world.\n\n2:42:29.900 --> 2:42:31.340\n No, no, it's about domination.\n\n2:42:31.340 --> 2:42:33.500\n It's about getting, yeah.\n\n2:42:33.500 --> 2:42:37.780\n It's a way for, if you are a lowest status white person,\n\n2:42:37.780 --> 2:42:41.080\n using anti racism is the only mechanism you will have\n\n2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:43.380\n to feel superior to another human being.\n\n2:42:43.380 --> 2:42:48.160\n So it's very useful for them in terms of fighting it.\n\n2:42:48.160 --> 2:42:50.500\n One of my suggestions has been to seize\n\n2:42:50.500 --> 2:42:51.980\n all university endowments,\n\n2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:54.140\n which are the crystallization of privilege\n\n2:42:54.140 --> 2:42:56.660\n and distribute that money as reparations.\n\n2:42:56.660 --> 2:42:59.040\n So be very effective by turning two populations\n\n2:42:59.040 --> 2:43:01.360\n against each other and strongly diminishing\n\n2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:04.260\n the university's intellectual hegemony.\n\n2:43:04.260 --> 2:43:07.020\n The universities are absolutely the real villains\n\n2:43:07.020 --> 2:43:08.000\n in the picture.\n\n2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:10.180\n Thankfully, they're also the least prepared\n\n2:43:10.180 --> 2:43:12.140\n to be aggressed upon.\n\n2:43:12.140 --> 2:43:15.460\n And after the government and the corporate press,\n\n2:43:15.460 --> 2:43:17.320\n they are the last leg of the stool,\n\n2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:18.460\n and they don't know what's coming,\n\n2:43:18.460 --> 2:43:21.380\n and it's gonna get ugly, and I cannot wait.\n\n2:43:21.380 --> 2:43:22.900\n So this is where you and I disagree.\n\n2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:25.740\n Part one, yeah, we disagree in the sense\n\n2:43:25.740 --> 2:43:30.740\n that you want to dismantle broken institutions.\n\n2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:31.640\n I don't think they're broken.\n\n2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:32.460\n They're powerful.\n\n2:43:32.460 --> 2:43:33.300\n They're working like by design.\n\n2:43:33.300 --> 2:43:34.940\n I think for over 100 years,\n\n2:43:34.940 --> 2:43:36.820\n they have been talking about bringing\n\n2:43:36.820 --> 2:43:38.700\n the next generation of American leaders,\n\n2:43:38.700 --> 2:43:42.340\n which is code, for promulgating an ideology\n\n2:43:42.340 --> 2:43:46.700\n based on egalitarian principles and world domination.\n\n2:43:47.540 --> 2:43:50.180\n Let me try to express my lived experience.\n\n2:43:50.180 --> 2:43:51.020\n Okay, sure.\n\n2:43:51.900 --> 2:43:56.460\n My experience at MIT is that there's a bunch\n\n2:43:56.460 --> 2:44:00.300\n of administrators that are, the bureaucracy,\n\n2:44:00.300 --> 2:44:03.980\n that I can say, this is the nice thing\n\n2:44:03.980 --> 2:44:06.100\n about having a podcast, I don't give a damn,\n\n2:44:06.100 --> 2:44:07.540\n is they're pretty useless.\n\n2:44:07.540 --> 2:44:09.380\n In fact, they get in the way.\n\n2:44:09.380 --> 2:44:12.480\n But there's faculty, there's professors,\n\n2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:15.140\n that are incredible.\n\n2:44:15.140 --> 2:44:16.580\n They're incredible human beings\n\n2:44:16.580 --> 2:44:20.580\n that all they do all day, they're too busy,\n\n2:44:20.580 --> 2:44:23.660\n but for the most part, what they do all day\n\n2:44:23.660 --> 2:44:26.940\n is just like continually pursue different\n\n2:44:26.940 --> 2:44:29.580\n little trajectories of curiosities\n\n2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:33.100\n in the various avenues of science that they work on.\n\n2:44:33.100 --> 2:44:38.100\n And as a side effect of that, they mentor\n\n2:44:38.140 --> 2:44:40.740\n a group of students, sometimes a large group of students,\n\n2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:43.300\n and also teach courses, and they're constantly\n\n2:44:43.300 --> 2:44:45.900\n sharing their passion with others.\n\n2:44:45.900 --> 2:44:49.220\n And my experience is it's just a bunch of people\n\n2:44:49.220 --> 2:44:52.160\n who are curious about engineering and math\n\n2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:55.060\n and science, chemistry, artificial intelligence,\n\n2:44:55.060 --> 2:44:57.700\n computer science, what I'm most familiar with.\n\n2:44:57.700 --> 2:45:01.220\n And there's never this feeling of MIT\n\n2:45:01.220 --> 2:45:04.700\n being broken somehow, like this kind of feeling.\n\n2:45:04.700 --> 2:45:08.300\n Like if I talk to you just now, or like Eric Weinstein,\n\n2:45:08.300 --> 2:45:11.540\n there's a feeling like stuff is on fire, right?\n\n2:45:11.540 --> 2:45:13.900\n There's something deeply broken.\n\n2:45:13.900 --> 2:45:18.900\n But when I'm in the system, especially before the COVID,\n\n2:45:19.020 --> 2:45:22.680\n before this kind of tension, everything was great.\n\n2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:25.360\n There was no discussion of, even diversity,\n\n2:45:25.360 --> 2:45:28.100\n all that kind of stuff, the toxic stuff\n\n2:45:28.100 --> 2:45:30.020\n that we might be talking about right now,\n\n2:45:30.020 --> 2:45:30.960\n none of that was happening.\n\n2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:35.060\n There was a bunch of people just in love with cool ideas,\n\n2:45:35.060 --> 2:45:37.300\n exploring ideas, being curious, and learning,\n\n2:45:37.300 --> 2:45:38.540\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:45:38.540 --> 2:45:43.380\n So I don't, my sense of academia was this is the place\n\n2:45:43.380 --> 2:45:47.860\n where kids in their 20s, 30s, and 40s can continue\n\n2:45:47.860 --> 2:45:50.740\n the playground of science, having fun.\n\n2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:54.100\n It's, if you destroy academia, if you destroy universities,\n\n2:45:54.100 --> 2:45:58.100\n like you're suggesting kind of lessening their power,\n\n2:45:58.100 --> 2:46:00.180\n you take away the playground from these kids\n\n2:46:00.180 --> 2:46:01.860\n to play.\n\n2:46:01.860 --> 2:46:03.500\n It's gonna be hard for you to tell me\n\n2:46:03.500 --> 2:46:05.020\n that I'm anti playground.\n\n2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:07.100\n Yeah, well, I guess I'm saying you're anti\n\n2:46:07.100 --> 2:46:08.980\n certain kinds of playgrounds, which is.\n\n2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:10.820\n Yeah, the ones that have the broken glass on the floor.\n\n2:46:10.820 --> 2:46:13.180\n Yeah, I am against those kinds of playgrounds.\n\n2:46:14.220 --> 2:46:18.060\n No, you're, you're, you're.\n\n2:46:18.060 --> 2:46:18.900\n Yes. Nope.\n\n2:46:18.900 --> 2:46:19.740\n See, see.\n\n2:46:19.740 --> 2:46:21.460\n Now you see, now you listen.\n\n2:46:21.460 --> 2:46:22.940\n Now you, now you wait.\n\n2:46:22.940 --> 2:46:27.460\n Yeah, I would say you're being the watchful mother who,\n\n2:46:27.460 --> 2:46:29.860\n the one kid who hurt themselves in the glass.\n\n2:46:29.860 --> 2:46:32.420\n One kid, it's an entire, it's generation after generation.\n\n2:46:32.420 --> 2:46:33.260\n I'm not a watchful mother.\n\n2:46:33.260 --> 2:46:34.660\n I'm the guy with the flamethrower.\n\n2:46:34.660 --> 2:46:36.900\n No, I, I, I understand that.\n\n2:46:37.780 --> 2:46:41.220\n But you're using the one kid who was always kind of like\n\n2:46:41.220 --> 2:46:44.180\n weird, aka gender studies department.\n\n2:46:44.180 --> 2:46:45.020\n Okay.\n\n2:46:45.020 --> 2:46:47.340\n That, that hurt themselves on the glass,\n\n2:46:47.340 --> 2:46:49.220\n as opposed to the people who are like,\n\n2:46:49.220 --> 2:46:53.900\n obviously having fun in the playground and not playing\n\n2:46:53.900 --> 2:46:55.580\n by the glass, the broken glass.\n\n2:46:55.580 --> 2:46:57.960\n And they're just, I mean, to me,\n\n2:46:57.960 --> 2:47:00.180\n some of the best innovations in science\n\n2:47:00.180 --> 2:47:02.060\n happen in universities.\n\n2:47:02.060 --> 2:47:02.900\n Okay.\n\n2:47:02.900 --> 2:47:07.020\n You can't forget that universities don't have this\n\n2:47:07.020 --> 2:47:12.020\n liberal, like politics literally in every conversation\n\n2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:15.180\n until this year, until this year,\n\n2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:16.500\n there's something happening.\n\n2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:19.420\n But every conversation I've ever had had nothing to do\n\n2:47:19.420 --> 2:47:20.260\n with politics.\n\n2:47:20.260 --> 2:47:22.220\n We never, Trump never came up.\n\n2:47:22.220 --> 2:47:23.840\n None of that ever come up.\n\n2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:24.680\n Nothing.\n\n2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:27.340\n Like all this kind of idea that there's liberal, all that.\n\n2:47:27.340 --> 2:47:29.820\n But that, that's in the humanities.\n\n2:47:29.820 --> 2:47:30.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:47:30.660 --> 2:47:33.460\n But do you think MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n2:47:33.460 --> 2:47:34.740\n might be a little bit of an outlier?\n\n2:47:34.740 --> 2:47:35.900\n Yeah, that probably is.\n\n2:47:35.900 --> 2:47:36.740\n Yeah.\n\n2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:40.540\n But I, I don't, I honestly don't think when people\n\n2:47:40.540 --> 2:47:43.860\n criticize academia, they're looking at,\n\n2:47:43.860 --> 2:47:46.700\n they're in fact also picking the outliers,\n\n2:47:46.700 --> 2:47:49.460\n which is they're picking some of the quote unquote\n\n2:47:49.460 --> 2:47:51.300\n strongest gender studies departments.\n\n2:47:51.300 --> 2:47:52.140\n This is nonsensical.\n\n2:47:52.140 --> 2:47:55.060\n When I was at Bucknell, it was a college student.\n\n2:47:55.060 --> 2:47:57.580\n We had to take, you know, we had a bunch of electives\n\n2:47:57.580 --> 2:47:59.500\n and I wanted to take a class on individual,\n\n2:47:59.500 --> 2:48:01.140\n American individualism.\n\n2:48:01.140 --> 2:48:04.440\n One of the texts of the five that we had to read\n\n2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:07.440\n was Birth of a Nation, the movie about the Klan.\n\n2:48:08.300 --> 2:48:12.720\n So there's no department where these people\n\n2:48:12.720 --> 2:48:17.400\n are not thoroughgoing, hardcore ideologues.\n\n2:48:17.400 --> 2:48:18.240\n This is not a gender.\n\n2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:19.340\n That's the humanities, that's the humanities.\n\n2:48:19.340 --> 2:48:21.940\n Fine, all the humanities, not just gender studies.\n\n2:48:21.940 --> 2:48:22.780\n Okay, fine.\n\n2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:23.620\n I can give you.\n\n2:48:23.620 --> 2:48:27.100\n Theory, English, all of them, every university,\n\n2:48:27.100 --> 2:48:31.620\n as you know, has it mandatory in the curriculum\n\n2:48:31.620 --> 2:48:34.480\n they have to take a bunch of these propaganda classes.\n\n2:48:35.700 --> 2:48:37.580\n I look forward to YouTube comments\n\n2:48:37.580 --> 2:48:39.680\n because you're being more eloquent\n\n2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:40.940\n and you're speaking to the thing\n\n2:48:40.940 --> 2:48:42.340\n that a lot of people agree with\n\n2:48:42.340 --> 2:48:44.220\n and I'm being my usual slow self\n\n2:48:44.220 --> 2:48:46.980\n and people are going to say not very nice things about me.\n\n2:48:46.980 --> 2:48:50.100\n Don't say anything that nice about Lex, please.\n\n2:48:50.100 --> 2:48:51.020\n Let me try to just.\n\n2:48:51.020 --> 2:48:52.940\n Just shoot up a school.\n\n2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:54.380\n That would be preferable.\n\n2:48:54.380 --> 2:48:55.720\n There he goes again.\n\n2:48:55.720 --> 2:48:56.560\n Only the teachers.\n\n2:48:56.560 --> 2:48:58.300\n Going to the darkest possible place.\n\n2:48:58.300 --> 2:48:59.700\n That's sunshine, baby, schools.\n\n2:48:59.700 --> 2:49:01.620\n That's where everyone goes to be happy, playgrounds.\n\n2:49:01.620 --> 2:49:03.400\n There he goes, dark ear.\n\n2:49:04.360 --> 2:49:07.500\n Just dives right in, just go dark\n\n2:49:07.500 --> 2:49:09.660\n and then just comes back up to the surface.\n\n2:49:10.620 --> 2:49:13.300\n I don't have to feel this way anymore.\n\n2:49:13.300 --> 2:49:15.300\n Just one day in the world.\n\n2:49:18.340 --> 2:49:19.920\n You're probably a figment of my imagination.\n\n2:49:19.920 --> 2:49:21.260\n I'm not even having this podcast.\n\n2:49:21.260 --> 2:49:23.140\n Well, after 18 Red Bulls, I'm surprised\n\n2:49:23.140 --> 2:49:24.580\n you could see anything.\n\n2:49:24.580 --> 2:49:25.580\n This is like Fight Club.\n\n2:49:25.580 --> 2:49:27.020\n Red Bull gives you delirium.\n\n2:49:27.020 --> 2:49:27.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:49:29.500 --> 2:49:32.360\n I got into it with Ed Norton yesterday on Twitter.\n\n2:49:32.360 --> 2:49:33.200\n Oh, really?\n\n2:49:33.200 --> 2:49:34.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:49:34.020 --> 2:49:35.940\n Is he like the rest of the celebrities?\n\n2:49:35.940 --> 2:49:38.060\n Yeah, he's like, oh, this is an existential threat\n\n2:49:38.060 --> 2:49:39.540\n to America, Trump's a fascist.\n\n2:49:39.540 --> 2:49:41.340\n He's delegitimizing the Oval Office.\n\n2:49:41.340 --> 2:49:43.340\n I said, what an odd endorsement of Trump.\n\n2:49:44.220 --> 2:49:45.620\n Well, you should have went with a bad pit.\n\n2:49:45.620 --> 2:49:46.980\n He might have a different opinion.\n\n2:49:46.980 --> 2:49:47.820\n That's true.\n\n2:49:47.820 --> 2:49:49.980\n So Fight Club reference, okay.\n\n2:49:49.980 --> 2:49:52.620\n This conversation is over.\n\n2:49:52.620 --> 2:49:53.460\n It's interesting.\n\n2:49:53.460 --> 2:49:56.020\n I'd like to draw a line between science and engineering\n\n2:49:56.020 --> 2:50:00.860\n and science not including like the biological aspect,\n\n2:50:00.860 --> 2:50:03.620\n the parts of biology that touch\n\n2:50:03.620 --> 2:50:04.980\n and humanities and biology.\n\n2:50:04.980 --> 2:50:08.060\n Like I feel because humanities,\n\n2:50:08.060 --> 2:50:10.720\n if you just look at the percentage of universities,\n\n2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:13.520\n it's still a minority percentage.\n\n2:50:13.520 --> 2:50:16.260\n And I would actually draw a different,\n\n2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:18.340\n I think they serve very different purposes.\n\n2:50:18.340 --> 2:50:19.180\n Sure.\n\n2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:22.340\n And that's actually a broken part about universities\n\n2:50:22.340 --> 2:50:27.060\n about like, why is some of the best research\n\n2:50:27.060 --> 2:50:28.300\n in the world done at universities?\n\n2:50:28.300 --> 2:50:31.340\n That doesn't, like there might be a different,\n\n2:50:31.340 --> 2:50:34.540\n like MIT, it feels weird that a faculty.\n\n2:50:34.540 --> 2:50:35.900\n Yeah, these are conceptually different things.\n\n2:50:35.900 --> 2:50:37.160\n Like we do research and we teach,\n\n2:50:37.160 --> 2:50:38.000\n why is this the same diagram?\n\n2:50:38.000 --> 2:50:38.900\n Yeah, it feels weird.\n\n2:50:38.900 --> 2:50:40.860\n But that's just, but I'm also,\n\n2:50:40.860 --> 2:50:44.680\n I'm coming to like the defense of the engineers\n\n2:50:44.680 --> 2:50:45.980\n that never talk about,\n\n2:50:45.980 --> 2:50:49.260\n I'm not like, my mind isn't,\n\n2:50:49.260 --> 2:50:51.000\n I'm not like deluded or something\n\n2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:53.940\n where I'm not seeing the house on fire.\n\n2:50:53.940 --> 2:50:55.780\n I'm just saying, I am seeing the house\n\n2:50:55.780 --> 2:50:57.320\n because I also lived in Harvard Square.\n\n2:50:57.320 --> 2:50:59.580\n I'm seeing Harvard, but in.\n\n2:50:59.580 --> 2:51:00.740\n And you see the tanks coming?\n\n2:51:00.740 --> 2:51:01.660\n They're coming, Lex.\n\n2:51:01.660 --> 2:51:02.500\n They're coming.\n\n2:51:02.500 --> 2:51:03.340\n It's gonna be so beautiful.\n\n2:51:03.340 --> 2:51:06.140\n It'll be like the American beauty, the plastic bag.\n\n2:51:06.140 --> 2:51:07.260\n I just won't be able to stop crying\n\n2:51:07.260 --> 2:51:08.180\n because it'll be so beautiful.\n\n2:51:08.180 --> 2:51:11.220\n Yeah, I can already see it.\n\n2:51:11.220 --> 2:51:14.620\n But the engineering departments where like,\n\n2:51:14.620 --> 2:51:18.100\n I believe that the Elon Musk's of the world,\n\n2:51:18.100 --> 2:51:20.660\n that the, like the innovation\n\n2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:22.980\n that will make a better world is happening.\n\n2:51:22.980 --> 2:51:25.200\n And like, let's not burn that down.\n\n2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:27.280\n Cause that has nothing to do with any,\n\n2:51:27.280 --> 2:51:29.260\n like they're all like sitting quietly\n\n2:51:29.260 --> 2:51:32.740\n in the, while like, while the humanities\n\n2:51:32.740 --> 2:51:34.180\n and all these kinds of diversity programs,\n\n2:51:34.180 --> 2:51:36.700\n they're not having any of these discussions.\n\n2:51:36.700 --> 2:51:39.180\n Listen, my Soviet brother, you both know,\n\n2:51:39.180 --> 2:51:41.460\n we both know that ice water runs in our veins.\n\n2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:42.820\n So if you're calling for mercy,\n\n2:51:42.820 --> 2:51:44.420\n that is not how I'm wired,\n\n2:51:44.420 --> 2:51:46.500\n but I'm not closing the door.\n\n2:51:46.500 --> 2:51:48.540\n Yeah, I'm actually realizing now,\n\n2:51:48.540 --> 2:51:50.660\n so for people listening to this,\n\n2:51:50.660 --> 2:51:52.660\n I'll probably prepend this in saying that\n\n2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:54.940\n I'm even slower than usual.\n\n2:51:54.940 --> 2:51:56.540\n I didn't sleep last night,\n\n2:51:56.540 --> 2:52:00.820\n but I feel I'm actually realizing just how slow I am\n\n2:52:00.820 --> 2:52:03.100\n and how much preparation I need to do.\n\n2:52:03.100 --> 2:52:06.740\n And if I would like to defend aspects of academia,\n\n2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:08.500\n I better come prepared.\n\n2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:09.680\n I don't think you need to defend them.\n\n2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:12.600\n I think I'm granting you your premise freely.\n\n2:52:12.600 --> 2:52:13.620\n No, you might be.\n\n2:52:13.620 --> 2:52:14.540\n Okay.\n\n2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:16.340\n I don't think the world is.\n\n2:52:16.340 --> 2:52:18.420\n But actually you just defeat your own argument\n\n2:52:18.420 --> 2:52:21.540\n because it is not at all have to be the way\n\n2:52:21.540 --> 2:52:24.580\n that a phenomenal research institution like MIT,\n\n2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:25.940\n which no one disputes,\n\n2:52:25.940 --> 2:52:28.740\n has to also be an educational establishment.\n\n2:52:28.740 --> 2:52:32.140\n These two things are not at all necessarily interconnected.\n\n2:52:32.140 --> 2:52:34.580\n But then you have to offer a way to separate.\n\n2:52:34.580 --> 2:52:35.420\n Correct.\n\n2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:38.940\n But like, I'm not a big fan, everybody's different,\n\n2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:41.100\n but I'm not a fan of criticizing institutions\n\n2:52:41.100 --> 2:52:43.340\n without offering a way to change.\n\n2:52:43.340 --> 2:52:46.060\n And especially when I'm like, have ability to change,\n\n2:52:46.060 --> 2:52:49.300\n I'd like to, yeah, I'd like to offer a path.\n\n2:52:49.300 --> 2:52:50.140\n Like.\n\n2:52:50.140 --> 2:52:51.700\n What if they were in students, they were all mentor,\n\n2:52:51.700 --> 2:52:55.940\n like, what's the opposite of a mentor?\n\n2:52:55.940 --> 2:52:56.780\n Mentee.\n\n2:52:56.780 --> 2:52:57.600\n Protege?\n\n2:52:57.600 --> 2:52:58.440\n What's the term when you like.\n\n2:52:58.440 --> 2:52:59.280\n Graduate students.\n\n2:52:59.280 --> 2:53:01.300\n When you work at a place, like interns,\n\n2:53:01.300 --> 2:53:02.860\n not an intern, it's not the word I'm thinking of.\n\n2:53:02.860 --> 2:53:04.900\n But anyway, like basically they're working there\n\n2:53:04.900 --> 2:53:06.660\n instead of going to college there.\n\n2:53:06.660 --> 2:53:08.820\n It's possible, but it's going against tradition.\n\n2:53:08.820 --> 2:53:11.780\n And so you have to build new institutions and.\n\n2:53:11.780 --> 2:53:15.100\n And have these engineers building new things, that's crazy.\n\n2:53:15.100 --> 2:53:16.420\n These research engineers,\n\n2:53:16.420 --> 2:53:18.980\n where they're going to be building things.\n\n2:53:18.980 --> 2:53:21.300\n Well, one of the things, cause you're kind of a.\n\n2:53:21.300 --> 2:53:22.600\n Apprentice, that's the word I was looking at.\n\n2:53:22.600 --> 2:53:23.440\n Apprentice.\n\n2:53:23.440 --> 2:53:24.620\n Which is ironic, we're talking about Trump\n\n2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:26.740\n and we couldn't think of the word apprentice.\n\n2:53:26.740 --> 2:53:28.260\n Yeah, well done.\n\n2:53:28.260 --> 2:53:29.100\n We should both be fired.\n\n2:53:29.100 --> 2:53:29.940\n You're fired.\n\n2:53:29.940 --> 2:53:30.900\n Yeah, there you go.\n\n2:53:31.780 --> 2:53:34.480\n These Russian Jews, so quick with their wit.\n\n2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:35.320\n Okay.\n\n2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:37.700\n But the thing is, you're a fan of freedom.\n\n2:53:37.700 --> 2:53:38.940\n I am.\n\n2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:42.260\n And there is intellectual freedom.\n\n2:53:42.260 --> 2:53:45.180\n People, this is what I was trying to articulate,\n\n2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:47.100\n I'm failing to articulate,\n\n2:53:47.100 --> 2:53:50.260\n but there truly is complete intellectual freedom\n\n2:53:50.260 --> 2:53:55.260\n within universities on topics of science and engineering.\n\n2:53:56.100 --> 2:53:57.980\n I believe you, I agree with you.\n\n2:53:57.980 --> 2:53:59.540\n I don't think it's going to take much persuasion,\n\n2:53:59.540 --> 2:54:01.460\n but I'll give you an example.\n\n2:54:01.460 --> 2:54:04.620\n When that, I'm sure you know more details about this\n\n2:54:04.620 --> 2:54:05.560\n than I do.\n\n2:54:05.560 --> 2:54:09.580\n When that scientist engineered that probe\n\n2:54:09.580 --> 2:54:11.740\n to land on that comet,\n\n2:54:11.740 --> 2:54:12.980\n and the articles are written\n\n2:54:12.980 --> 2:54:15.240\n because this Hawaiian shirt he was wearing\n\n2:54:15.240 --> 2:54:16.380\n had like pinup girls on it,\n\n2:54:16.380 --> 2:54:18.380\n which I think his female student sewed for him\n\n2:54:18.380 --> 2:54:19.820\n or something, or his ex girlfriend.\n\n2:54:19.820 --> 2:54:21.600\n And he had to apologize.\n\n2:54:21.600 --> 2:54:23.620\n This is what Rand was talking about.\n\n2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:26.440\n That the great accomplishments of men\n\n2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:29.260\n have to say I'm sorry to the lowest,\n\n2:54:29.260 --> 2:54:31.260\n most despicable, disgusting people.\n\n2:54:32.420 --> 2:54:34.240\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:54:34.240 --> 2:54:36.900\n Let me bring this case up because I think about this.\n\n2:54:37.860 --> 2:54:39.060\n This might not mean much to you,\n\n2:54:39.060 --> 2:54:41.140\n but it means a lot to certain aspects\n\n2:54:41.140 --> 2:54:42.540\n of the computer science community.\n\n2:54:42.540 --> 2:54:44.740\n There's a guy named Richard Stallman.\n\n2:54:44.740 --> 2:54:46.980\n I don't know if you know who that is.\n\n2:54:46.980 --> 2:54:51.280\n He's the founder of the Free Software Foundation.\n\n2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:52.260\n He's like a big Linux.\n\n2:54:52.260 --> 2:54:53.340\n He's one of the key people\n\n2:54:53.340 --> 2:54:54.900\n in the history of computer science,\n\n2:54:54.900 --> 2:54:56.800\n one of those open source people, right?\n\n2:54:56.800 --> 2:55:00.260\n But he is like, I believe he's one of the hardcore ones,\n\n2:55:00.260 --> 2:55:02.740\n which is like all software should be free.\n\n2:55:02.740 --> 2:55:05.360\n Okay, so it's very interesting personality,\n\n2:55:05.360 --> 2:55:07.260\n very key person in the GNU,\n\n2:55:07.260 --> 2:55:10.160\n just like Linus Torvald, key person.\n\n2:55:10.160 --> 2:55:13.500\n So, but he also kind of speaks his mind.\n\n2:55:13.500 --> 2:55:18.500\n And on a certain chain of conversations at MIT\n\n2:55:20.100 --> 2:55:22.300\n that was leaked to the New York Times,\n\n2:55:22.300 --> 2:55:26.460\n then it was published, led him to be fired\n\n2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:30.660\n or pushed out of MIT recently, maybe a year ago.\n\n2:55:30.660 --> 2:55:32.740\n And it always sat weird with me.\n\n2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:37.740\n So what happened is there's a few undergraduate students\n\n2:55:38.860 --> 2:55:41.220\n that called Marvin Minsky.\n\n2:55:41.220 --> 2:55:42.700\n Not sure if you're familiar with who that is.\n\n2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:43.540\n I've heard the name.\n\n2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:46.460\n He's one of the seminal people in artificial intelligence.\n\n2:55:46.460 --> 2:55:49.960\n They said that they called him a rapist\n\n2:55:49.960 --> 2:55:53.020\n because he met with Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n2:55:53.020 --> 2:55:56.880\n And Jeffrey Epstein solicited,\n\n2:55:58.180 --> 2:55:59.980\n these are the best facts known to me\n\n2:55:59.980 --> 2:56:02.820\n that I'm aware of, that's what was stated on the chain,\n\n2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:04.740\n is he solicited a 17,\n\n2:56:04.740 --> 2:56:07.020\n but it might've been an 18 year old girl,\n\n2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:09.160\n to come up to Marvin Minsky\n\n2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:12.240\n and ask him if he wanted to have sex with her.\n\n2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:15.860\n So Jeffrey Epstein told the girl.\n\n2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:18.140\n She came up to Marvin Minsky,\n\n2:56:18.140 --> 2:56:20.680\n who was at that time, I think, seven years old.\n\n2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:23.220\n And his wife was there too, Marvin Minsky's wife.\n\n2:56:23.220 --> 2:56:28.220\n And he said no, or like awkwardly saying no thanks.\n\n2:56:28.220 --> 2:56:33.220\n And that was stated in the email thread\n\n2:56:34.420 --> 2:56:39.420\n as Marvin participating in sexual assault\n\n2:56:39.460 --> 2:56:43.460\n and rape of this unwilling sexual assault.\n\n2:56:43.460 --> 2:56:47.460\n And it was called rape of this person, right?\n\n2:56:47.460 --> 2:56:50.500\n Of this woman that propositioned him.\n\n2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:55.500\n And then Richard Stallman, who's, he's kind of known for this.\n\n2:56:55.500 --> 2:56:59.220\n He's very, he's, you make fun of me being a robot,\n\n2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:01.140\n but he's kind of like a debugger.\n\n2:57:01.140 --> 2:57:03.140\n He's like, well, that sentence is not,\n\n2:57:03.140 --> 2:57:05.300\n what you said is not correct.\n\n2:57:05.300 --> 2:57:07.280\n So he like corrected the person,\n\n2:57:08.540 --> 2:57:13.540\n basically made it seem like the use of the word rape\n\n2:57:13.760 --> 2:57:16.660\n is not correct, because that's not the definition of rape.\n\n2:57:16.660 --> 2:57:19.140\n And then he was attacked for saying,\n\n2:57:19.140 --> 2:57:21.100\n oh, now you're playing with definitions of rape.\n\n2:57:21.100 --> 2:57:23.780\n Rape is rape is the answer, right?\n\n2:57:23.780 --> 2:57:27.220\n And then that was leaked in him defending.\n\n2:57:27.220 --> 2:57:28.460\n So the way it was leaked,\n\n2:57:28.460 --> 2:57:33.460\n it was reported as him defending rape.\n\n2:57:35.260 --> 2:57:36.940\n That's the way it was reported.\n\n2:57:36.940 --> 2:57:40.940\n And he was pushed out and he didn't really give a damn.\n\n2:57:40.940 --> 2:57:44.420\n It's, he doesn't seem to make a big deal out of it.\n\n2:57:44.420 --> 2:57:45.260\n He just left.\n\n2:57:45.260 --> 2:57:46.460\n He made an example of him.\n\n2:57:46.460 --> 2:57:48.020\n They made an example and that,\n\n2:57:48.020 --> 2:57:51.700\n and that everyone was afraid to defend him.\n\n2:57:51.700 --> 2:57:53.220\n So like, there's a bunch of faculty.\n\n2:57:53.220 --> 2:57:54.060\n One.\n\n2:57:54.060 --> 2:57:54.880\n Dude, you're from the Soviet Union.\n\n2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:57.160\n Doesn't this hit close to home for you?\n\n2:57:58.540 --> 2:57:59.580\n I don't know what to think of it.\n\n2:57:59.580 --> 2:58:03.100\n It hits close to home, but it was basically,\n\n2:58:03.100 --> 2:58:06.660\n at least at MIT, now MIT is such a light place with this.\n\n2:58:06.660 --> 2:58:08.460\n It's not common at MIT,\n\n2:58:08.460 --> 2:58:11.100\n but it was like 18, 19 year old kids,\n\n2:58:11.100 --> 2:58:14.380\n undergraduate kids with this kind of fire in them.\n\n2:58:14.380 --> 2:58:15.920\n There's just very few of them,\n\n2:58:15.920 --> 2:58:19.140\n but they're the ones that raise all this kind of fuss.\n\n2:58:19.140 --> 2:58:23.060\n And the entirety of the administration,\n\n2:58:23.060 --> 2:58:25.740\n all the faculty are afraid to stand up to them.\n\n2:58:26.740 --> 2:58:28.320\n It's so interesting to me.\n\n2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:31.860\n Like, I don't know if I should be afraid of that.\n\n2:58:31.860 --> 2:58:32.980\n You don't think you should be afraid\n\n2:58:32.980 --> 2:58:34.900\n that someone who's trying to be specific\n\n2:58:34.900 --> 2:58:37.260\n when it comes to charges of violent assault\n\n2:58:37.260 --> 2:58:38.620\n is looking for that clarity,\n\n2:58:38.620 --> 2:58:40.660\n can get their life out of search of his room?\n\n2:58:40.660 --> 2:58:42.400\n Let me give you more context.\n\n2:58:43.420 --> 2:58:46.020\n There's a little bit more context to Richard Stallman,\n\n2:58:46.020 --> 2:58:46.860\n which is.\n\n2:58:46.860 --> 2:58:47.700\n He was also a rapist.\n\n2:58:47.700 --> 2:58:49.260\n No.\n\n2:58:49.260 --> 2:58:50.100\n I left out that part.\n\n2:58:50.100 --> 2:58:51.100\n He liked raping people.\n\n2:58:51.100 --> 2:58:54.220\n But he's had a history through his life\n\n2:58:55.900 --> 2:59:00.020\n of every once in a while wearing the Hawaiian shirt with,\n\n2:59:00.020 --> 2:59:01.220\n like he would make.\n\n2:59:01.220 --> 2:59:02.500\n He's a fat.\n\n2:59:04.180 --> 2:59:06.940\n Sorry, but he's a fat unattractive.\n\n2:59:06.940 --> 2:59:08.780\n Like what Trump referred to the hacker.\n\n2:59:08.780 --> 2:59:11.220\n Yeah, yeah, the guy in the basement.\n\n2:59:11.220 --> 2:59:12.060\n That's Richard.\n\n2:59:12.060 --> 2:59:12.900\n Okay, I love.\n\n2:59:14.560 --> 2:59:15.580\n He is what he is.\n\n2:59:16.420 --> 2:59:18.420\n He like, he would eat his own.\n\n2:59:18.420 --> 2:59:20.780\n He would pick skin from his feet in lectures\n\n2:59:20.780 --> 2:59:21.620\n and just eat it.\n\n2:59:21.620 --> 2:59:22.460\n No.\n\n2:59:22.460 --> 2:59:23.280\n Okay, yeah.\n\n2:59:23.280 --> 2:59:24.660\n Those videos of him doing that.\n\n2:59:24.660 --> 2:59:25.500\n I'm not joking.\n\n2:59:25.500 --> 2:59:26.920\n He must really be behind the spectrum then.\n\n2:59:26.920 --> 2:59:27.760\n Yeah, okay.\n\n2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:28.980\n Oh, yeah.\n\n2:59:28.980 --> 2:59:32.220\n And you know,\n\n2:59:32.220 --> 2:59:36.140\n I think in his office,\n\n2:59:36.140 --> 2:59:37.980\n door, he wrote something like\n\n2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:45.820\n hacker plus lover of ladies or something like that.\n\n2:59:45.820 --> 2:59:47.500\n Like something kind of.\n\n2:59:47.500 --> 2:59:48.940\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:59:48.940 --> 2:59:50.140\n Unprofessional.\n\n2:59:50.140 --> 2:59:50.980\n Yeah, unprofessional.\n\n2:59:50.980 --> 2:59:51.940\n And a little creepy.\n\n2:59:51.940 --> 2:59:52.780\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:59:52.780 --> 2:59:53.600\n No, that's fair.\n\n2:59:53.600 --> 2:59:54.440\n So he was also.\n\n2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:56.580\n So they're looking for an excuse to get rid of him,\n\n2:59:56.580 --> 2:59:58.020\n it sounds like.\n\n2:59:58.020 --> 3:00:00.700\n No, he was just, who's they?\n\n3:00:00.700 --> 3:00:01.800\n The administration.\n\n3:00:02.700 --> 3:00:04.060\n Yeah, probably, probably.\n\n3:00:04.060 --> 3:00:06.020\n A lot of times what people don't realize,\n\n3:00:06.020 --> 3:00:08.580\n and this would be my defense of cancel culture.\n\n3:00:08.580 --> 3:00:10.140\n A lot of times when someone gets fired\n\n3:00:10.140 --> 3:00:12.260\n over something like this, this isn't why.\n\n3:00:12.260 --> 3:00:14.540\n This is just giving them cover to get rid of them\n\n3:00:14.540 --> 3:00:15.620\n without getting a lawsuit.\n\n3:00:15.620 --> 3:00:17.660\n Yeah, but it's still.\n\n3:00:17.660 --> 3:00:21.460\n Right, so I think, I guess what I'm trying to communicate\n\n3:00:21.460 --> 3:00:23.500\n is he was a little weird and creepy\n\n3:00:23.500 --> 3:00:27.380\n and he may not be the best for the community,\n\n3:00:27.380 --> 3:00:30.460\n but that's not necessarily the message it's sent\n\n3:00:30.460 --> 3:00:31.780\n to the rest of the community.\n\n3:00:31.780 --> 3:00:34.340\n The message is sent to the rest of the community\n\n3:00:34.340 --> 3:00:37.020\n that being clear about words\n\n3:00:37.020 --> 3:00:39.180\n or the usage of the word rape\n\n3:00:39.180 --> 3:00:41.940\n is like you should call everything rape.\n\n3:00:41.940 --> 3:00:44.500\n That's basically the message it was sent.\n\n3:00:44.500 --> 3:00:46.880\n Or you should call it we say rape, rape.\n\n3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:48.380\n It's about submission.\n\n3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:50.580\n I think you'd be very happy to know\n\n3:00:50.580 --> 3:00:52.060\n that there's a lot of people,\n\n3:00:52.060 --> 3:00:53.340\n and she's very crucified of this,\n\n3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:56.060\n like Betsy DeVos, the performance department of education,\n\n3:00:56.060 --> 3:00:58.140\n who are aware of this.\n\n3:00:58.140 --> 3:01:01.520\n They are aware that this completely contradicts due process.\n\n3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:03.740\n They're aware of how a rape accusation\n\n3:01:03.740 --> 3:01:05.560\n is something not to be taken seriously,\n\n3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:07.180\n but because it's not to be taken seriously,\n\n3:01:07.180 --> 3:01:09.460\n it has to be also taken seriously in the other context\n\n3:01:09.460 --> 3:01:12.060\n that once that word is around a male,\n\n3:01:12.060 --> 3:01:13.700\n this can ruin his entire life.\n\n3:01:13.700 --> 3:01:17.380\n That's the sticky thing of the word.\n\n3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:22.380\n Like I, like I think about this a lot that,\n\n3:01:24.860 --> 3:01:26.540\n like how would I defend it if somebody,\n\n3:01:26.540 --> 3:01:28.260\n like I've never, I can honestly say\n\n3:01:28.260 --> 3:01:32.500\n I've never done anything close to creepy in my life\n\n3:01:32.500 --> 3:01:34.860\n like with women.\n\n3:01:34.860 --> 3:01:36.460\n But you wouldn't know it if you had, right?\n\n3:01:36.460 --> 3:01:37.300\n That's the thing.\n\n3:01:37.300 --> 3:01:39.120\n A lot of these creepy guys don't think they're creepy.\n\n3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:40.940\n They think they're being cute.\n\n3:01:40.940 --> 3:01:42.020\n Yeah, but I'm just telling you,\n\n3:01:42.020 --> 3:01:45.860\n even like, fine, let's say, right,\n\n3:01:45.860 --> 3:01:47.180\n let's say I'm not aware of it.\n\n3:01:47.180 --> 3:01:50.060\n But the point that I am aware of\n\n3:01:50.060 --> 3:01:52.580\n is that somebody could just completely make something up.\n\n3:01:52.580 --> 3:01:54.180\n Correct, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n3:01:54.180 --> 3:01:55.820\n And like how, what would I?\n\n3:01:55.820 --> 3:01:57.340\n No, he denied the charges.\n\n3:01:57.340 --> 3:01:59.540\n There's an article around everything he did, supposedly,\n\n3:01:59.540 --> 3:02:02.620\n and it goes, Mr. Friedman denied the charges, yeah.\n\n3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:04.340\n But what creeps me out?\n\n3:02:04.340 --> 3:02:05.420\n That happened, can I interrupt?\n\n3:02:05.420 --> 3:02:07.420\n Zora Neale Hurston is one of my favorite writers.\n\n3:02:07.420 --> 3:02:09.780\n She's from the Harlem Renaissance.\n\n3:02:09.780 --> 3:02:11.420\n She wrote, Their Eyes Are Watching God,\n\n3:02:11.420 --> 3:02:12.460\n and a couple of other books.\n\n3:02:12.460 --> 3:02:14.300\n She was just an amazing, amazing figure.\n\n3:02:14.300 --> 3:02:16.680\n Her biography is called Wrapped in Rainbows.\n\n3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:17.800\n It's just a masterpiece.\n\n3:02:17.800 --> 3:02:18.780\n I think I read it one day.\n\n3:02:18.780 --> 3:02:19.780\n Can't recommend her enough.\n\n3:02:19.780 --> 3:02:21.640\n Fascinating, fascinating woman.\n\n3:02:21.640 --> 3:02:24.780\n During the 30s, I think it was, or 1940,\n\n3:02:24.780 --> 3:02:26.340\n she was out of the country.\n\n3:02:26.340 --> 3:02:29.860\n She was accused of molesting a teenage boy.\n\n3:02:29.860 --> 3:02:31.900\n She wasn't in America.\n\n3:02:31.900 --> 3:02:33.220\n This could be proven.\n\n3:02:33.220 --> 3:02:36.060\n So it's absolutely false, not even a question.\n\n3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:39.900\n She was indicted, and she wanted to kill herself\n\n3:02:39.900 --> 3:02:43.820\n because she's like, people are gonna see these things,\n\n3:02:43.820 --> 3:02:45.460\n and they're gonna think maybe there's some truth to it.\n\n3:02:45.460 --> 3:02:46.920\n Maybe it's voluntary.\n\n3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:49.180\n What they're just gonna, and you could understand\n\n3:02:49.180 --> 3:02:50.940\n why she'd be suicidal over this.\n\n3:02:50.940 --> 3:02:52.940\n So yeah, this is something that's been going on\n\n3:02:52.940 --> 3:02:55.560\n for a long time, and the fact that it's becoming,\n\n3:02:55.560 --> 3:02:57.180\n I do agree, it's important.\n\n3:02:57.180 --> 3:02:59.580\n I know a lot of women who have been sexually assaulted,\n\n3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:01.560\n more than I'm happy that I know.\n\n3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:03.820\n And if I know that many, that means there's more.\n\n3:03:03.820 --> 3:03:08.540\n So I think it's a good idea that they feel seen,\n\n3:03:08.540 --> 3:03:10.540\n that they don't feel wounded, they don't feel damaged,\n\n3:03:10.540 --> 3:03:12.020\n that they could talk to their friends.\n\n3:03:12.020 --> 3:03:13.920\n And I'm like, man, this sucks is happening to you.\n\n3:03:13.920 --> 3:03:15.720\n And I don't think you're a slut.\n\n3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:16.860\n I don't think you're asking for it.\n\n3:03:16.860 --> 3:03:17.860\n I think you feel violated.\n\n3:03:17.860 --> 3:03:19.180\n I think it's gross.\n\n3:03:19.180 --> 3:03:20.020\n Talk to me.\n\n3:03:20.020 --> 3:03:21.940\n I do think that that's important.\n\n3:03:21.940 --> 3:03:23.820\n And I also think it's important though,\n\n3:03:23.820 --> 3:03:26.540\n when things get kind of in a frenzy,\n\n3:03:26.540 --> 3:03:27.820\n that a lot of people are like,\n\n3:03:27.820 --> 3:03:29.500\n yeah, I also had something happen.\n\n3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:33.200\n And very quickly the line between he grabbed my boob\n\n3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:34.900\n and he violently raped me,\n\n3:03:34.900 --> 3:03:37.080\n I don't think these two things are the same at all.\n\n3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.020\n I think they're both sexual assault,\n\n3:03:39.020 --> 3:03:41.820\n but in terms of what someone can deal with the next day,\n\n3:03:41.820 --> 3:03:43.620\n the next month, 10 years later,\n\n3:03:43.620 --> 3:03:45.920\n I don't think they're similar scenarios.\n\n3:03:47.420 --> 3:03:49.240\n I had Juanita Brodrick on my show\n\n3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:53.820\n and hearing her talk about her alleged rape by Bill Clinton\n\n3:03:53.820 --> 3:03:56.940\n was very disturbing for me, very disturbing to hear.\n\n3:03:56.940 --> 3:03:58.800\n Because it was like half an hour.\n\n3:03:58.800 --> 3:04:00.300\n So we think of these things and think,\n\n3:04:00.300 --> 3:04:01.960\n okay, hold her down, blah, blah, blah.\n\n3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:02.800\n And then it's done.\n\n3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:03.660\n Half an hour when,\n\n3:04:03.660 --> 3:04:05.460\n just even someone physically holding you down\n\n3:04:05.460 --> 3:04:06.620\n for half an hour.\n\n3:04:06.620 --> 3:04:08.300\n Like not even a sexual assault.\n\n3:04:08.300 --> 3:04:09.980\n Like that's traumatic.\n\n3:04:09.980 --> 3:04:12.460\n You think, your brain's gonna think, am I gonna die?\n\n3:04:12.460 --> 3:04:14.040\n When I zoom out,\n\n3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:16.860\n I think that ultimately this is gonna lead\n\n3:04:16.860 --> 3:04:18.700\n to a better world.\n\n3:04:18.700 --> 3:04:23.580\n Like empowering women to speak to those kinds of experiences,\n\n3:04:24.460 --> 3:04:27.500\n the benefit of it outweighs the...\n\n3:04:27.500 --> 3:04:30.300\n The issue is whenever people are given a weapon,\n\n3:04:30.300 --> 3:04:33.300\n some are going to use it in nefarious ways.\n\n3:04:33.300 --> 3:04:34.540\n And that's the lesson of history.\n\n3:04:34.540 --> 3:04:38.580\n Males, females, whites, blacks, children, adults.\n\n3:04:38.580 --> 3:04:40.980\n When people are given a mechanism to execute power\n\n3:04:40.980 --> 3:04:43.500\n over others, some are gonna use it.\n\n3:04:43.500 --> 3:04:46.480\n Can I ask you for a therapy thing?\n\n3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:47.320\n Sure.\n\n3:04:48.620 --> 3:04:50.440\n On trolling, in a sense.\n\n3:04:51.520 --> 3:04:55.060\n Because I mentioned somebody making up something about me.\n\n3:04:55.060 --> 3:04:57.420\n I feel, because I wear my heart on my sleeve,\n\n3:04:59.560 --> 3:05:01.960\n I'm not good with these attacks.\n\n3:05:01.960 --> 3:05:03.820\n Like I've been attacked recently,\n\n3:05:03.820 --> 3:05:06.420\n just being called a fraud and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:05:06.420 --> 3:05:07.300\n Just light stuff.\n\n3:05:07.300 --> 3:05:11.880\n Like I haven't, you know, it was like, it hurt.\n\n3:05:11.880 --> 3:05:13.460\n Okay, well, let me help you.\n\n3:05:13.460 --> 3:05:15.860\n Maybe it's because I'm a New Yorker.\n\n3:05:15.860 --> 3:05:16.700\n No, I'm serious.\n\n3:05:16.700 --> 3:05:17.860\n Here's why.\n\n3:05:17.860 --> 3:05:21.140\n In New York, a lot of times you'll be walking\n\n3:05:21.140 --> 3:05:24.660\n with your friend and a homeless person will come up to you\n\n3:05:24.660 --> 3:05:26.740\n and start yelling things at you.\n\n3:05:26.740 --> 3:05:29.740\n Your reaction isn't in those circumstances.\n\n3:05:29.740 --> 3:05:31.360\n Let me hear this out.\n\n3:05:31.360 --> 3:05:35.060\n Your reaction is physical safety and getting away.\n\n3:05:35.060 --> 3:05:38.500\n Now, it's not impossible that that homeless person\n\n3:05:38.500 --> 3:05:39.900\n is actually saying the truth.\n\n3:05:39.900 --> 3:05:42.020\n This happened to a friend of mine.\n\n3:05:42.020 --> 3:05:43.220\n This guy wasn't homeless\n\n3:05:44.340 --> 3:05:46.940\n and he's walking down the street on Smith Street\n\n3:05:46.940 --> 3:05:48.640\n and he's just talking out loud.\n\n3:05:48.640 --> 3:05:50.600\n And he goes, why they call them hipsters?\n\n3:05:50.600 --> 3:05:52.020\n What are they hip to?\n\n3:05:52.020 --> 3:05:53.420\n And she chuckles.\n\n3:05:53.420 --> 3:05:55.180\n And he goes, what are you laughing at, fatso?\n\n3:05:55.180 --> 3:05:57.220\n You start something, I'll finish it.\n\n3:05:57.220 --> 3:05:59.060\n And she just couldn't move.\n\n3:05:59.060 --> 3:06:02.460\n And it's like, it's my main problem\n\n3:06:02.460 --> 3:06:04.340\n because that's the first thing he went to.\n\n3:06:04.340 --> 3:06:07.980\n And I don't know that I have any advice,\n\n3:06:07.980 --> 3:06:11.020\n but when you hear something like this,\n\n3:06:11.020 --> 3:06:13.580\n I think you need to be better in terms of boundaries.\n\n3:06:13.580 --> 3:06:16.220\n I think you should not perceive this as a fellow human,\n\n3:06:16.220 --> 3:06:18.780\n but as a crazy homeless person,\n\n3:06:18.780 --> 3:06:21.460\n because if this fellow human,\n\n3:06:21.460 --> 3:06:24.660\n if I thought that you were a fraud in some context,\n\n3:06:24.660 --> 3:06:25.900\n that's a very weird word to use\n\n3:06:25.900 --> 3:06:29.020\n because fraudulent podcaster, these are real mics,\n\n3:06:29.020 --> 3:06:29.860\n but if I thought.\n\n3:06:29.860 --> 3:06:31.900\n Well, a scientist or a human.\n\n3:06:31.900 --> 3:06:33.720\n Sure, but I would ask myself,\n\n3:06:33.720 --> 3:06:36.420\n is this person in a position to make this judgment\n\n3:06:36.420 --> 3:06:37.880\n or are they backing it up?\n\n3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:40.620\n Are they saying, here, your conclusions were wrong,\n\n3:06:40.620 --> 3:06:42.620\n here's some mistakes in your data\n\n3:06:42.620 --> 3:06:44.660\n and you can engage with them in ideas,\n\n3:06:44.660 --> 3:06:46.140\n but whenever someone uses a word\n\n3:06:46.140 --> 3:06:48.000\n to entirely dismiss your life\n\n3:06:48.000 --> 3:06:50.620\n without having the knowledge of your life,\n\n3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:53.660\n you do not have to take that seriously.\n\n3:06:53.660 --> 3:06:55.280\n I appreciate that kind of idea,\n\n3:06:55.280 --> 3:06:58.300\n but some things aren't about data,\n\n3:06:58.300 --> 3:07:02.060\n like I see myself as a fraud often\n\n3:07:02.060 --> 3:07:05.480\n and it's more psychology of it.\n\n3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:09.120\n If I can reduce something to reason,\n\n3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:11.140\n I can probably be fine.\n\n3:07:11.140 --> 3:07:14.580\n My worry is the same as the worry of teenage girls\n\n3:07:14.580 --> 3:07:16.260\n that get bullied online.\n\n3:07:16.260 --> 3:07:19.220\n It's like when I'm being open and fragile on the internet,\n\n3:07:20.140 --> 3:07:22.460\n it affects me in a way where I can't,\n\n3:07:22.460 --> 3:07:23.980\n the reason doesn't help.\n\n3:07:23.980 --> 3:07:24.820\n So it helps me, but.\n\n3:07:24.820 --> 3:07:26.220\n You don't block people enough.\n\n3:07:26.220 --> 3:07:27.420\n I'm very heavy with the blocking.\n\n3:07:27.420 --> 3:07:29.180\n No, so yeah, I block.\n\n3:07:29.180 --> 3:07:30.100\n Very heavy.\n\n3:07:30.100 --> 3:07:31.860\n I block, it's helped a lot.\n\n3:07:31.860 --> 3:07:34.420\n Any aggressive banality, I block immediately.\n\n3:07:34.420 --> 3:07:36.380\n I also think time is gonna help.\n\n3:07:36.380 --> 3:07:37.540\n I don't think you're,\n\n3:07:37.540 --> 3:07:40.260\n like you didn't grow up wanting to be a podcaster, right?\n\n3:07:40.260 --> 3:07:41.740\n That wasn't your aspiration.\n\n3:07:41.740 --> 3:07:43.660\n So in some sense, you are gonna feel like a fraud\n\n3:07:43.660 --> 3:07:45.140\n because you're like, I don't have any training for this.\n\n3:07:45.140 --> 3:07:46.460\n I have a training for a scientist.\n\n3:07:46.460 --> 3:07:48.040\n I can talk to you about artificial intelligence\n\n3:07:48.040 --> 3:07:49.980\n for literally hours, but in terms of this,\n\n3:07:49.980 --> 3:07:50.980\n like I don't know what I'm doing.\n\n3:07:50.980 --> 3:07:53.580\n I'm kind of, so when they call you a fake,\n\n3:07:53.580 --> 3:07:55.140\n it's like, yeah, you're kind of right\n\n3:07:55.140 --> 3:07:57.740\n because like I did kind of stumble into this\n\n3:07:57.740 --> 3:07:59.720\n and this is not my pedigree.\n\n3:07:59.720 --> 3:08:01.940\n So I think that kind of probably speaks to you\n\n3:08:01.940 --> 3:08:02.780\n on some level.\n\n3:08:02.780 --> 3:08:05.220\n Well, but they're attacking not the podcast thing,\n\n3:08:05.220 --> 3:08:07.260\n but more like the same,\n\n3:08:07.260 --> 3:08:08.860\n people call Elon Musk a fraud too,\n\n3:08:08.860 --> 3:08:11.120\n which that's the way I rationalize it.\n\n3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:13.980\n Like, well, if they're calling him a fraud\n\n3:08:13.980 --> 3:08:15.700\n and they're calling me a fraud,\n\n3:08:17.100 --> 3:08:20.420\n like even if you have rockets that go into,\n\n3:08:20.420 --> 3:08:22.260\n like if you successfully have rockets\n\n3:08:22.260 --> 3:08:26.300\n landing back on earth, reusable rockets,\n\n3:08:26.300 --> 3:08:29.800\n you're still being called a fraud, then it's okay.\n\n3:08:30.980 --> 3:08:31.820\n Not necessarily.\n\n3:08:31.820 --> 3:08:32.640\n It could be that he's not a fraud.\n\n3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:33.480\n You really are.\n\n3:08:35.060 --> 3:08:36.940\n That's, but it's not resonating with you\n\n3:08:36.940 --> 3:08:38.140\n because your brain knows the logic.\n\n3:08:38.140 --> 3:08:39.260\n So you can't trick yourself.\n\n3:08:39.260 --> 3:08:42.620\n But yeah, yeah.\n\n3:08:42.620 --> 3:08:44.940\n But I don't know, this whole trolling thing,\n\n3:08:44.940 --> 3:08:49.940\n you seem to be much better at seeing it as a game.\n\n3:08:50.740 --> 3:08:51.780\n You know why?\n\n3:08:51.780 --> 3:08:54.380\n Because you are under the delusion\n\n3:08:54.380 --> 3:08:56.220\n that every human being is capable\n\n3:08:56.220 --> 3:08:57.940\n of intelligent reasoned decisions.\n\n3:08:57.940 --> 3:08:58.780\n Still think I'm right.\n\n3:08:58.780 --> 3:09:01.460\n And I perceive them as literally animals.\n\n3:09:01.460 --> 3:09:03.780\n So when a dog starts barking,\n\n3:09:03.780 --> 3:09:05.820\n all it's saying is that the dog is agitated\n\n3:09:05.820 --> 3:09:08.260\n and this is not going to change my life one iota\n\n3:09:08.260 --> 3:09:09.940\n other than crossing the street, perhaps.\n\n3:09:09.940 --> 3:09:12.900\n Yeah, I'm going to prove you wrong one day.\n\n3:09:12.900 --> 3:09:13.900\n You're going to kill yourself\n\n3:09:13.900 --> 3:09:15.540\n because they can drive you to it.\n\n3:09:15.540 --> 3:09:17.540\n The first shoot up of school.\n\n3:09:17.540 --> 3:09:19.340\n But if I don't, I'll prove you wrong.\n\n3:09:19.340 --> 3:09:20.660\n I'll bring the data.\n\n3:09:20.660 --> 3:09:22.300\n And they'd be like, you're right, Lex.\n\n3:09:22.300 --> 3:09:23.340\n I have the receipts.\n\n3:09:23.340 --> 3:09:24.980\n I have the receipts.\n\n3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:27.660\n Okay, so we mentioned Camus.\n\n3:09:27.660 --> 3:09:29.260\n Oh yeah, I love him.\n\n3:09:29.260 --> 3:09:34.260\n Is there, this is a question that people like love\n\n3:09:34.340 --> 3:09:35.500\n when I ask.\n\n3:09:35.500 --> 3:09:37.380\n I'm a really smart people.\n\n3:09:37.380 --> 3:09:38.340\n What it is, love?\n\n3:09:39.660 --> 3:09:44.660\n No, what books, let's say three books,\n\n3:09:44.780 --> 3:09:47.940\n if you can think of them, technical, fiction,\n\n3:09:47.940 --> 3:09:52.060\n philosophical, would you, had a big impact on you\n\n3:09:52.060 --> 3:09:53.700\n or would you recommend to others?\n\n3:09:53.700 --> 3:09:54.540\n Sure.\n\n3:09:54.540 --> 3:09:56.940\n The Machiavellians by James Burnham.\n\n3:09:56.940 --> 3:09:59.820\n This is a book about how politics works in reality\n\n3:09:59.820 --> 3:10:02.460\n as opposed to how people imagine it working.\n\n3:10:03.380 --> 3:10:05.660\n Mentis Moldbug, who's a figure in these circles,\n\n3:10:05.660 --> 3:10:07.460\n who's respected by a lot of people.\n\n3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:10.380\n I was giving a talk and there was a bunch of panelists\n\n3:10:10.380 --> 3:10:12.620\n and we were asked, what book would you recommend?\n\n3:10:12.620 --> 3:10:14.020\n I said, The Machiavellians.\n\n3:10:14.020 --> 3:10:17.060\n Independently of me, that was the book he had recommended.\n\n3:10:17.060 --> 3:10:18.580\n It's out of print, it's hard to find,\n\n3:10:18.580 --> 3:10:19.860\n but that would be one.\n\n3:10:19.860 --> 3:10:20.900\n Is that his book or no?\n\n3:10:20.900 --> 3:10:23.620\n James Burnham, it came out in 1941, I think.\n\n3:10:23.620 --> 3:10:26.820\n So can you pause on the, what's his?\n\n3:10:26.820 --> 3:10:28.180\n Mentis Moldbug.\n\n3:10:28.180 --> 3:10:29.740\n That's a code name, right?\n\n3:10:29.740 --> 3:10:31.060\n That guy's pen name.\n\n3:10:31.060 --> 3:10:33.460\n Curtis Yarvin, that's his real name.\n\n3:10:33.460 --> 3:10:35.620\n He swims in your circles.\n\n3:10:35.620 --> 3:10:36.460\n Which circles?\n\n3:10:36.460 --> 3:10:37.300\n He does some kind of programming.\n\n3:10:37.300 --> 3:10:38.660\n Oh, he's originally a programmer.\n\n3:10:38.660 --> 3:10:43.660\n Yeah, he comes up as a person that I should talk with\n\n3:10:43.740 --> 3:10:46.820\n or I should know about, but then I read a few of his things\n\n3:10:46.820 --> 3:10:49.180\n and they seem quite dangerous.\n\n3:10:49.180 --> 3:10:50.780\n They're very long and verbose,\n\n3:10:50.780 --> 3:10:53.100\n but I think he's an amazing thinker.\n\n3:10:53.100 --> 3:10:53.940\n Yeah, but.\n\n3:10:53.940 --> 3:10:54.780\n But he's the one who had the idea\n\n3:10:54.780 --> 3:10:56.460\n of sending the tanks to Harvard Yard.\n\n3:10:56.460 --> 3:10:58.100\n But doesn't he have like,\n\n3:11:00.380 --> 3:11:01.300\n he has some radical views.\n\n3:11:01.300 --> 3:11:02.140\n I forget what they are.\n\n3:11:02.140 --> 3:11:04.540\n Very radical views, yeah, he wants a military coup.\n\n3:11:06.620 --> 3:11:08.420\n But you're saying he's a serious thinker\n\n3:11:08.420 --> 3:11:11.780\n that is worthy of, not worthy.\n\n3:11:11.780 --> 3:11:13.200\n I don't know that you would enjoy\n\n3:11:13.200 --> 3:11:14.340\n having a conversation with him.\n\n3:11:14.340 --> 3:11:16.140\n I think a lot of people enjoy seeing it happen,\n\n3:11:16.140 --> 3:11:18.220\n but I think it would be a lot of talking past each other\n\n3:11:18.220 --> 3:11:20.660\n and it would be interesting.\n\n3:11:20.660 --> 3:11:21.500\n What do you agree?\n\n3:11:21.500 --> 3:11:22.340\n I didn't agree with him to watch.\n\n3:11:22.340 --> 3:11:24.100\n What do you disagree, okay.\n\n3:11:24.100 --> 3:11:25.380\n What do you agree, what do you disagree with him?\n\n3:11:25.380 --> 3:11:28.900\n I agree with him that politics has to be looked at\n\n3:11:28.900 --> 3:11:33.200\n objectively and without kind of an emotional connection\n\n3:11:33.200 --> 3:11:34.580\n to different schools.\n\n3:11:34.580 --> 3:11:37.060\n I talk about him a lot in my book on the New Right.\n\n3:11:38.280 --> 3:11:42.140\n Disagree, I don't think a military coup is a good idea.\n\n3:11:42.140 --> 3:11:47.060\n He doesn't think anarchism is stable, I disagree.\n\n3:11:47.060 --> 3:11:49.140\n I mean, me and him, I did a live stream with him\n\n3:11:49.140 --> 3:11:50.460\n which just dorked out a lot about history\n\n3:11:50.460 --> 3:11:52.820\n and people who've fallen in the memory hole.\n\n3:11:52.820 --> 3:11:56.220\n So, I mean, he's got a lot of writing, so.\n\n3:11:56.220 --> 3:11:58.980\n So, you know, the sense I got from him\n\n3:11:58.980 --> 3:12:01.580\n was that if I talk with him,\n\n3:12:01.580 --> 3:12:03.740\n a lot of people would be upset with me\n\n3:12:03.740 --> 3:12:05.220\n for giving him a platform.\n\n3:12:05.220 --> 3:12:07.220\n Yeah, I think he's on that edge\n\n3:12:07.220 --> 3:12:09.620\n where they want to read him out of\n\n3:12:09.620 --> 3:12:11.500\n what is acceptable discourse.\n\n3:12:11.500 --> 3:12:13.460\n What's his most controversial,\n\n3:12:13.460 --> 3:12:15.220\n I mean, you keep mentioning the tanks.\n\n3:12:15.220 --> 3:12:17.120\n Is that the most controversial viewpoint?\n\n3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:18.340\n Does he have a race thing?\n\n3:12:18.340 --> 3:12:21.420\n No, the alt right doesn't particularly like him\n\n3:12:21.420 --> 3:12:24.140\n in many ways because he's not a big on the race thing.\n\n3:12:24.140 --> 3:12:27.580\n I don't know what would be his most controversial view,\n\n3:12:27.580 --> 3:12:28.580\n to be honest.\n\n3:12:28.580 --> 3:12:33.220\n I think because he is radical in terms of his analysis\n\n3:12:33.220 --> 3:12:34.960\n of culture, anytime someone's a radical,\n\n3:12:34.960 --> 3:12:35.800\n that is dangerous.\n\n3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:36.940\n Yeah, it's dangerous.\n\n3:12:36.940 --> 3:12:39.100\n Okay, book, so that's one.\n\n3:12:39.100 --> 3:12:40.180\n The Fountainhead.\n\n3:12:40.180 --> 3:12:41.260\n The Fountainhead.\n\n3:12:41.260 --> 3:12:43.380\n Which is a, I would say.\n\n3:12:43.380 --> 3:12:44.300\n Not Atlas Shrugged?\n\n3:12:44.300 --> 3:12:46.180\n No, and if you read Atlas Shrugged\n\n3:12:46.180 --> 3:12:47.140\n before reading The Fountainhead,\n\n3:12:47.140 --> 3:12:48.660\n you're doing yourself an enormous disservice.\n\n3:12:48.660 --> 3:12:49.980\n Don't you dare do it.\n\n3:12:49.980 --> 3:12:52.380\n On the philosophical or because the novel is better?\n\n3:12:52.380 --> 3:12:53.220\n On every level.\n\n3:12:53.220 --> 3:12:54.580\n Fountainhead's a better novel.\n\n3:12:54.580 --> 3:12:57.140\n Fountainhead's superfluous if you read Atlas Shrugged first.\n\n3:12:57.140 --> 3:13:00.460\n Fountainhead's about psychology and ethics.\n\n3:13:00.460 --> 3:13:02.260\n It does not have to do with her politics\n\n3:13:02.260 --> 3:13:03.820\n other than its implications.\n\n3:13:03.820 --> 3:13:06.020\n So it's by far the superior book.\n\n3:13:06.020 --> 3:13:08.140\n The third one.\n\n3:13:08.140 --> 3:13:09.500\n Ooh, this is a good one question.\n\n3:13:09.500 --> 3:13:10.340\n Let me see.\n\n3:13:10.340 --> 3:13:13.180\n There's so many good books out there that I love.\n\n3:13:13.180 --> 3:13:16.300\n I'm going to, this is not really my third choice,\n\n3:13:16.300 --> 3:13:18.340\n but I'll throw it out there because I,\n\n3:13:19.220 --> 3:13:21.140\n this is such an important worldview,\n\n3:13:21.140 --> 3:13:22.820\n especially for people on the right.\n\n3:13:22.820 --> 3:13:24.180\n Are you virtue signaling?\n\n3:13:24.180 --> 3:13:25.740\n No, this is counter signaling.\n\n3:13:26.780 --> 3:13:27.860\n Thaddeus Russell's book,\n\n3:13:27.860 --> 3:13:29.620\n A Renegade History of the United States.\n\n3:13:29.620 --> 3:13:33.240\n His thesis is that it's the degenerates\n\n3:13:33.240 --> 3:13:35.080\n that give us all freedom.\n\n3:13:36.020 --> 3:13:38.580\n And things like prostitutes, things like madams,\n\n3:13:38.580 --> 3:13:41.540\n things like slaves, things like immigrants,\n\n3:13:41.540 --> 3:13:44.420\n because they were so low status,\n\n3:13:44.420 --> 3:13:46.000\n they could get away with things\n\n3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:47.940\n that then people who are higher status demanded\n\n3:13:47.940 --> 3:13:48.900\n and so on and so forth.\n\n3:13:48.900 --> 3:13:50.540\n So I think that thesis,\n\n3:13:50.540 --> 3:13:55.440\n and it really has extreme consequences in thinking.\n\n3:13:57.340 --> 3:13:59.900\n And no, Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind.\n\n3:13:59.900 --> 3:14:01.340\n That's, those are the four.\n\n3:14:02.740 --> 3:14:03.580\n Is that his best?\n\n3:14:03.580 --> 3:14:04.700\n I haven't read any of his stuff.\n\n3:14:04.700 --> 3:14:06.060\n The Righteous Mind is the only one you want.\n\n3:14:06.060 --> 3:14:10.340\n Okay, that was four, but of course.\n\n3:14:10.340 --> 3:14:12.540\n Forget Thaddeus Russell, put Haidt in there.\n\n3:14:12.540 --> 3:14:14.080\n Of course he would.\n\n3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:16.180\n No, forget Thaddeus, those are the three.\n\n3:14:17.380 --> 3:14:18.820\n So we talked about love.\n\n3:14:18.820 --> 3:14:21.720\n Let me ask you the other question I'm obsessed with.\n\n3:14:22.740 --> 3:14:26.300\n Are you, do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n3:14:26.300 --> 3:14:29.780\n I do, a lot, especially now that I'm an uncle,\n\n3:14:29.780 --> 3:14:31.860\n especially now that I have like these younger people\n\n3:14:31.860 --> 3:14:33.640\n that I mentor.\n\n3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:36.140\n I was just yesterday, my friend, John Girguis,\n\n3:14:36.140 --> 3:14:37.700\n who did my theme song for my podcast,\n\n3:14:37.700 --> 3:14:40.900\n who did the book cover for Dear Reader,\n\n3:14:40.900 --> 3:14:42.940\n who's like the most talented person I know.\n\n3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:45.460\n His song came on the iPod at the gym\n\n3:14:45.460 --> 3:14:46.500\n and I almost messaged him.\n\n3:14:46.500 --> 3:14:48.900\n I go, you know, one day one of us is gonna bury the other\n\n3:14:48.900 --> 3:14:50.420\n and it's gonna be really sad.\n\n3:14:50.420 --> 3:14:52.080\n And I thought about that and it was kind of like,\n\n3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:54.020\n oh man, that's really gonna suck.\n\n3:14:54.020 --> 3:14:56.380\n And I don't know which scenario would be better.\n\n3:14:56.380 --> 3:14:58.660\n Like I will be very sad if he's gone.\n\n3:14:58.660 --> 3:15:00.620\n I'm sure he'd be very sad if I'm gone.\n\n3:15:01.540 --> 3:15:03.420\n I mean, what do you, are you afraid of it?\n\n3:15:03.420 --> 3:15:08.180\n No, you know, Rand had this quote about how\n\n3:15:08.180 --> 3:15:10.340\n I won't die, the world will end.\n\n3:15:10.340 --> 3:15:13.580\n So I've had enough experiences that I am,\n\n3:15:13.580 --> 3:15:16.980\n I've really, at this point,\n\n3:15:16.980 --> 3:15:18.820\n and everything's icing on the cake.\n\n3:15:18.820 --> 3:15:20.800\n So if you, if I were to kill you\n\n3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:24.420\n at the end of this podcast, it feels painless.\n\n3:15:24.420 --> 3:15:25.260\n That would be okay?\n\n3:15:25.260 --> 3:15:26.620\n Yeah, you know why?\n\n3:15:26.620 --> 3:15:28.340\n Does anyone know you're here by the way?\n\n3:15:28.340 --> 3:15:30.460\n You know why?\n\n3:15:30.460 --> 3:15:32.140\n Just asking for a friend.\n\n3:15:32.140 --> 3:15:34.620\n Here's why, there's that wit.\n\n3:15:34.620 --> 3:15:36.020\n Save that for Twitter likes.\n\n3:15:37.420 --> 3:15:38.940\n Do they call you Sasha?\n\n3:15:38.940 --> 3:15:40.300\n No, I'm a Lyosha.\n\n3:15:40.300 --> 3:15:41.940\n Oh, that's my sister's husband.\n\n3:15:41.940 --> 3:15:45.580\n Okay, so here's why.\n\n3:15:45.580 --> 3:15:47.260\n I strongly believe,\n\n3:15:47.260 --> 3:15:49.520\n and this is a very kind of Jewish perspective,\n\n3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:50.980\n that you just have to leave the world\n\n3:15:50.980 --> 3:15:52.340\n a little bit better than you found it.\n\n3:15:52.340 --> 3:15:54.420\n That all you could do is move the needle a little.\n\n3:15:54.420 --> 3:15:56.500\n And one of the things I set out to do\n\n3:15:56.500 --> 3:15:58.860\n with Dear Reader, my book on North Korea,\n\n3:15:58.860 --> 3:16:01.420\n I was at a point in my career where I could do something\n\n3:16:01.420 --> 3:16:02.740\n to make a difference instead of just writing,\n\n3:16:02.740 --> 3:16:04.500\n like coauthoring books for celebrities,\n\n3:16:04.500 --> 3:16:07.540\n which I'm very proud of, but are neither here nor there.\n\n3:16:07.540 --> 3:16:09.780\n And I thought, all right, I know how to tell stories,\n\n3:16:09.780 --> 3:16:12.140\n I know how to inform people, I know how to entertain people.\n\n3:16:12.140 --> 3:16:14.420\n If I move the needle in America, who cares?\n\n3:16:14.420 --> 3:16:15.740\n We got it really good here.\n\n3:16:15.740 --> 3:16:18.360\n If I move the needle in North Korea a little bit,\n\n3:16:18.360 --> 3:16:20.300\n the cost benefits through the roof.\n\n3:16:20.300 --> 3:16:22.380\n I never thought of that actually.\n\n3:16:22.380 --> 3:16:24.820\n I never thought of Dear Reader from that perspective.\n\n3:16:24.820 --> 3:16:28.000\n So when I set out to write it, I'm like, okay,\n\n3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:28.840\n what can I do?\n\n3:16:28.840 --> 3:16:30.740\n I'm not gonna be able to liberate the North Korean regime.\n\n3:16:30.740 --> 3:16:34.620\n What I can do is the camera right now is focused on,\n\n3:16:34.620 --> 3:16:36.980\n at the time, Kim Jong Il, now Kim Jong Un.\n\n3:16:36.980 --> 3:16:38.940\n And I can do just this a little bit.\n\n3:16:38.940 --> 3:16:42.700\n And I go, behind that guy, who you think is funny clown,\n\n3:16:42.700 --> 3:16:44.500\n there's millions of dead people.\n\n3:16:44.500 --> 3:16:46.220\n There's children being starved.\n\n3:16:46.220 --> 3:16:47.860\n There's people who are performing\n\n3:16:47.860 --> 3:16:49.620\n because they have a gun to their kid's head.\n\n3:16:49.620 --> 3:16:51.060\n And if someone put a gun to your kid's head,\n\n3:16:51.060 --> 3:16:53.160\n you'd put on those dancing shoes real quick.\n\n3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:57.420\n And I and others have managed to change the conversation\n\n3:16:57.420 --> 3:17:00.660\n about North Korea in terms of look at those silly buffoons\n\n3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:02.940\n to those poor people.\n\n3:17:02.940 --> 3:17:05.620\n So the fact that that little thing I can say\n\n3:17:05.620 --> 3:17:07.740\n with a straight face, I did,\n\n3:17:07.740 --> 3:17:09.380\n doesn't make me a great person,\n\n3:17:09.380 --> 3:17:13.060\n but it does make me someone who, if I have to go tomorrow,\n\n3:17:13.060 --> 3:17:15.600\n I can say I did a little bit\n\n3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:17.780\n to make the world a better place.\n\n3:17:17.780 --> 3:17:20.220\n What do you think is the meaning of life?\n\n3:17:21.060 --> 3:17:23.820\n I think the meaning of life is...\n\n3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:27.620\n Why are we here?\n\n3:17:27.620 --> 3:17:29.560\n Oh, well, I'm a Camu person.\n\n3:17:29.560 --> 3:17:31.340\n So I'll give the Camu answer.\n\n3:17:31.340 --> 3:17:33.740\n So there's two types of people.\n\n3:17:33.740 --> 3:17:35.020\n Those who know how to use binary...\n\n3:17:35.020 --> 3:17:35.860\n No.\n\n3:17:35.860 --> 3:17:36.700\n There's...\n\n3:17:36.700 --> 3:17:40.700\n Thanks for relating to the audience.\n\n3:17:41.620 --> 3:17:42.940\n One, one, one, zero, zero, one, two.\n\n3:17:42.940 --> 3:17:43.780\n Two?\n\n3:17:45.300 --> 3:17:46.140\n Down vote.\n\n3:17:47.540 --> 3:17:50.100\n What kind of radical freak is this Lex?\n\n3:17:50.100 --> 3:17:53.340\n So, and I use this example of my forthcoming book.\n\n3:17:53.340 --> 3:17:56.060\n You go into a countryside, a mountainside,\n\n3:17:56.060 --> 3:17:59.020\n and you see a blank canvas on an easel.\n\n3:17:59.020 --> 3:18:00.620\n And one kind of mentality goes,\n\n3:18:00.620 --> 3:18:02.860\n this is just a blank canvas.\n\n3:18:02.860 --> 3:18:03.700\n This is stupid.\n\n3:18:03.700 --> 3:18:05.020\n This is what am I looking at?\n\n3:18:05.020 --> 3:18:08.300\n And the other type goes, what a great opportunity.\n\n3:18:08.300 --> 3:18:09.780\n I'm in this beautiful space.\n\n3:18:09.780 --> 3:18:11.460\n I have this entire canvas to paint.\n\n3:18:11.460 --> 3:18:13.280\n I could do anything I want with it.\n\n3:18:13.280 --> 3:18:16.620\n So I am very much of that type two person.\n\n3:18:16.620 --> 3:18:21.620\n And I hope others start to think of life in that way.\n\n3:18:21.940 --> 3:18:23.700\n You and I have both been more successful\n\n3:18:23.700 --> 3:18:25.900\n than we expected to, especially growing up,\n\n3:18:25.900 --> 3:18:28.620\n and in ways we did not expect.\n\n3:18:28.620 --> 3:18:30.020\n And when you're young,\n\n3:18:30.020 --> 3:18:33.020\n you are so intent on driving the car.\n\n3:18:33.020 --> 3:18:34.220\n And after a certain point,\n\n3:18:34.220 --> 3:18:35.780\n you realize it's not about driving the car.\n\n3:18:35.780 --> 3:18:37.300\n It's you're being a surfer,\n\n3:18:37.300 --> 3:18:39.280\n that you can only control this little board\n\n3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:41.060\n and you have no idea where the waves will take you.\n\n3:18:41.060 --> 3:18:42.160\n And sometimes you're gonna fall down\n\n3:18:42.160 --> 3:18:43.140\n and something's gonna really gonna suck\n\n3:18:43.140 --> 3:18:44.800\n and you're gonna swallow some saltwater.\n\n3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:47.440\n But at a certain point, you stop trying to drive\n\n3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:48.820\n and you're like, this is freaking awesome\n\n3:18:48.820 --> 3:18:50.660\n and I have no idea where it's gonna go.\n\n3:18:51.860 --> 3:18:53.380\n Beautifully put.\n\n3:18:53.380 --> 3:18:54.980\n I know I speak for a lot of people.\n\n3:18:54.980 --> 3:18:58.820\n First of all, everyone loves the game you play\n\n3:18:58.820 --> 3:18:59.660\n on the intranet.\n\n3:18:59.660 --> 3:19:00.740\n It's fun.\n\n3:19:00.740 --> 3:19:02.220\n You make the world not everyone.\n\n3:19:02.220 --> 3:19:05.220\n Today, oof, they came for me hard.\n\n3:19:05.220 --> 3:19:08.540\n But it makes the world seem fun.\n\n3:19:08.540 --> 3:19:12.580\n And especially in this dark time, it's much appreciated.\n\n3:19:12.580 --> 3:19:14.580\n And we can't wait till the next book\n\n3:19:14.580 --> 3:19:15.580\n and the many to come\n\n3:19:15.580 --> 3:19:18.580\n and to hopefully many more Joe Rogan appearances.\n\n3:19:18.580 --> 3:19:20.300\n You guys do some great magic together.\n\n3:19:20.300 --> 3:19:21.140\n This is fun.\n\n3:19:21.140 --> 3:19:26.140\n It's, you, yeah, you're one of my favorite guests on this show\n\n3:19:26.540 --> 3:19:27.500\n so I can't wait.\n\n3:19:27.500 --> 3:19:30.700\n Especially if you can make it before the election.\n\n3:19:30.700 --> 3:19:32.260\n Thanks so much for making today happen.\n\n3:19:32.260 --> 3:19:33.740\n I'm glad you came down.\n\n3:19:33.740 --> 3:19:34.580\n You're awesome.\n\n3:19:34.580 --> 3:19:35.400\n Thank you so much.\n\n3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:37.160\n What a great compliment.\n\n3:19:37.160 --> 3:19:38.820\n Thanks for listening to this
