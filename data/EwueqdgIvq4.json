optoelectronic intelligence.\n\n00:08.440 --> 00:12.160\n We have a deep technical dive into computing hardware\n\n00:12.160 --> 00:14.080\n that will make Jim Keller proud.\n\n00:14.080 --> 00:17.440\n I urge you to hop onto this rollercoaster ride\n\n00:17.440 --> 00:19.320\n through neuromorphic computing\n\n00:19.320 --> 00:21.720\n and superconducting electronics\n\n00:21.720 --> 00:24.360\n and hold on for dear life.\n\n00:24.360 --> 00:27.200\n Jeff is a great communicator of technical information\n\n00:27.200 --> 00:30.160\n and so it was truly a pleasure to talk to him\n\n00:30.160 --> 00:32.300\n about some physics and engineering.\n\n00:33.160 --> 00:34.440\n To support this podcast,\n\n00:34.440 --> 00:37.440\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:39.880\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast\n\n00:39.880 --> 00:43.380\n and here is my conversation with Jeff Schoenlein.\n\n00:44.380 --> 00:48.920\n I got a chance to read a fascinating paper you authored\n\n00:48.920 --> 00:52.040\n called Optoelectronic Intelligence.\n\n00:52.040 --> 00:55.180\n So maybe we can start by talking about this paper\n\n00:55.180 --> 00:57.060\n and start with the basic questions.\n\n00:57.060 --> 01:00.360\n What is optoelectronic intelligence?\n\n01:00.360 --> 01:02.040\n Yeah, so in that paper,\n\n01:02.040 --> 01:04.280\n the concept I was trying to describe\n\n01:04.280 --> 01:06.680\n is sort of an architecture\n\n01:06.680 --> 01:10.820\n for building brain inspired computing\n\n01:10.820 --> 01:13.380\n that leverages light for communication\n\n01:13.380 --> 01:17.640\n in conjunction with electronic circuits for computation.\n\n01:17.640 --> 01:18.920\n In that particular paper,\n\n01:18.920 --> 01:20.880\n a lot of the work we're doing right now\n\n01:20.880 --> 01:22.000\n in our project at NIST\n\n01:22.000 --> 01:25.840\n is focused on superconducting electronics for computation.\n\n01:25.840 --> 01:27.760\n I won't go into why that is,\n\n01:27.760 --> 01:31.440\n but that might make a little more sense in context\n\n01:31.440 --> 01:35.440\n if we first describe what that is in contrast to,\n\n01:35.440 --> 01:37.880\n which is semiconducting electronics.\n\n01:37.880 --> 01:39.720\n So is it worth taking a couple minutes\n\n01:39.720 --> 01:42.820\n to describe semiconducting electronics?\n\n01:42.820 --> 01:45.960\n It might even be worthwhile to step back\n\n01:45.960 --> 01:49.960\n and talk about electricity and circuits\n\n01:49.960 --> 01:52.240\n and how circuits work\n\n01:52.240 --> 01:54.760\n before we talk about superconductivity.\n\n01:54.760 --> 01:56.560\n Right, okay.\n\n01:56.560 --> 01:58.080\n How does a computer work, Jeff?\n\n01:58.080 --> 01:59.800\n Well, I won't go into everything\n\n01:59.800 --> 02:01.120\n that makes a computer work,\n\n02:01.120 --> 02:05.200\n but let's talk about the basic building blocks,\n\n02:05.200 --> 02:08.440\n a transistor, and even more basic than that,\n\n02:08.440 --> 02:11.520\n a semiconductor material, silicon, say.\n\n02:11.520 --> 02:15.440\n So in silicon, silicon is a semiconductor,\n\n02:15.440 --> 02:18.440\n and what that means is at low temperature,\n\n02:18.440 --> 02:20.760\n there are no free charges,\n\n02:20.760 --> 02:22.880\n no free electrons that can move around.\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:24.920\n So when you talk about electricity,\n\n02:24.920 --> 02:28.040\n you're talking about predominantly electrons\n\n02:28.040 --> 02:30.780\n moving to establish electrical currents,\n\n02:30.780 --> 02:33.080\n and they move under the influence of voltages.\n\n02:33.080 --> 02:36.640\n So you apply voltages, electrons move around,\n\n02:36.640 --> 02:38.420\n those can be measured as currents,\n\n02:38.420 --> 02:40.920\n and you can represent information in that way.\n\n02:40.920 --> 02:43.840\n So semiconductors are special\n\n02:43.840 --> 02:46.860\n in the sense that they are really malleable.\n\n02:46.860 --> 02:49.200\n So if you have a semiconductor material,\n\n02:50.080 --> 02:52.600\n you can change the number of free electrons\n\n02:52.600 --> 02:56.020\n that can move around by putting different elements,\n\n02:56.020 --> 02:58.280\n different atoms in lattice sites.\n\n02:58.280 --> 03:00.200\n So what is a lattice site?\n\n03:00.200 --> 03:02.200\n Well, a semiconductor is a crystal,\n\n03:02.200 --> 03:06.480\n which means all the atoms that comprise the material\n\n03:06.480 --> 03:09.000\n are at exact locations\n\n03:09.000 --> 03:10.880\n that are perfectly periodic in space.\n\n03:10.880 --> 03:12.220\n So if you start at any one atom\n\n03:12.220 --> 03:14.660\n and you go along what are called the lattice vectors,\n\n03:14.660 --> 03:17.320\n you get to another atom and another atom and another atom,\n\n03:17.320 --> 03:19.440\n and for high quality devices,\n\n03:19.440 --> 03:21.920\n it's important that it's a perfect crystal\n\n03:21.920 --> 03:23.820\n with very few defects,\n\n03:23.820 --> 03:27.440\n but you can intentionally replace a silicon atom\n\n03:27.440 --> 03:29.240\n with say a phosphorus atom,\n\n03:29.240 --> 03:32.160\n and then you can change the number of free electrons\n\n03:32.160 --> 03:33.980\n that are in a region of space\n\n03:33.980 --> 03:37.140\n that has that excess of what are called dopants.\n\n03:37.140 --> 03:40.260\n So picture a device that has a left terminal\n\n03:40.260 --> 03:42.040\n and a right terminal,\n\n03:42.040 --> 03:44.160\n and if you apply a voltage between those two,\n\n03:44.160 --> 03:47.740\n you can cause electrical current to flow between them.\n\n03:47.740 --> 03:52.120\n Now we add a third terminal up on top there,\n\n03:52.120 --> 03:53.800\n and depending on the voltage\n\n03:53.800 --> 03:57.160\n between the left and right terminal and that third voltage,\n\n03:57.160 --> 03:58.720\n you can change that current.\n\n03:58.720 --> 04:02.280\n So what's commonly done in digital electronic circuits\n\n04:02.280 --> 04:06.560\n is to leave a fixed voltage from left to right,\n\n04:06.560 --> 04:08.600\n and then change that voltage\n\n04:08.600 --> 04:10.000\n that's applied at what's called the gate,\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.220\n the gate of the transistor.\n\n04:11.220 --> 04:13.960\n So what you do is you make it to where\n\n04:13.960 --> 04:15.680\n there's an excess of electrons on the left,\n\n04:15.680 --> 04:17.360\n excess of electrons on the right,\n\n04:17.360 --> 04:18.880\n and very few electrons in the middle,\n\n04:18.880 --> 04:21.520\n and you do this by changing the concentration\n\n04:21.520 --> 04:24.800\n of different dopants in the lattice spatially.\n\n04:24.800 --> 04:27.900\n And then when you apply a voltage to that gate,\n\n04:27.900 --> 04:30.680\n you can either cause current to flow or turn it off,\n\n04:30.680 --> 04:33.440\n and so that's sort of your zero and one.\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:35.360\n If you apply voltage, current can flow,\n\n04:35.360 --> 04:38.380\n that current is representing a digital one,\n\n04:38.380 --> 04:41.960\n and from that, from that basic element,\n\n04:41.960 --> 04:44.200\n you can build up all the complexity\n\n04:44.200 --> 04:45.520\n of digital electronic circuits\n\n04:45.520 --> 04:50.080\n that have really had a profound influence on our society.\n\n04:50.080 --> 04:51.600\n Now you're talking about electrons.\n\n04:51.600 --> 04:54.680\n Can you give a sense of what scale we're talking about\n\n04:54.680 --> 04:56.520\n when we're talking about in silicon\n\n04:57.600 --> 05:01.560\n being able to mass manufacture these kinds of gates?\n\n05:01.560 --> 05:04.480\n Yeah, so scale in a number of different senses.\n\n05:04.480 --> 05:07.520\n Well, at the scale of the silicon lattice,\n\n05:07.520 --> 05:10.880\n the distance between two atoms there is half a nanometer.\n\n05:10.880 --> 05:14.480\n So people often like to compare these things\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:16.540\n to the width of a human hair.\n\n05:16.540 --> 05:20.040\n I think it's some six orders of magnitude smaller\n\n05:20.040 --> 05:24.440\n than the width of a human hair, something on that order.\n\n05:24.440 --> 05:25.840\n So remarkably small,\n\n05:25.840 --> 05:27.280\n we're talking about individual atoms here,\n\n05:27.280 --> 05:29.480\n and electrons are of that length scale\n\n05:29.480 --> 05:31.520\n when they're in that environment.\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:32.440\n But there's another sense\n\n05:32.440 --> 05:34.380\n that scale matters in digital electronics.\n\n05:34.380 --> 05:36.460\n This is perhaps the more important sense,\n\n05:36.460 --> 05:37.880\n although they're related.\n\n05:37.880 --> 05:41.340\n Scale refers to a number of things.\n\n05:41.340 --> 05:44.560\n It refers to the size of that transistor.\n\n05:44.560 --> 05:47.280\n So for example, I said you have a left contact,\n\n05:47.280 --> 05:49.800\n a right contact, and some space between them\n\n05:49.800 --> 05:52.280\n where the gate electrode sits.\n\n05:52.280 --> 05:56.000\n That's called the channel width or the channel length.\n\n05:56.000 --> 06:00.120\n And what has enabled what we think of as Moore's law\n\n06:00.120 --> 06:03.040\n or the continued increased performance\n\n06:03.040 --> 06:05.560\n in silicon microelectronic circuits\n\n06:05.560 --> 06:08.960\n is the ability to make that size, that feature size,\n\n06:08.960 --> 06:13.960\n ever smaller, ever smaller at a really remarkable pace.\n\n06:14.800 --> 06:19.800\n I mean, that feature size has decreased consistently\n\n06:20.160 --> 06:23.760\n every couple of years since the 1960s.\n\n06:23.760 --> 06:27.160\n And that was what Moore predicted in the 1960s.\n\n06:27.160 --> 06:29.480\n He thought it would continue for at least two more decades,\n\n06:29.480 --> 06:30.800\n and it's been much longer than that.\n\n06:30.800 --> 06:35.800\n And so that is why we've been able to fit ever more devices,\n\n06:35.800 --> 06:39.000\n ever more transistors, ever more computational power\n\n06:39.000 --> 06:41.440\n on essentially the same size of chip.\n\n06:41.440 --> 06:44.400\n So a user sits back and does essentially nothing.\n\n06:44.400 --> 06:45.960\n You're running the same computer program,\n\n06:45.960 --> 06:48.360\n but those devices are getting smaller, so they get faster,\n\n06:48.360 --> 06:50.080\n they get more energy efficient,\n\n06:50.080 --> 06:51.520\n and all of our computing performance\n\n06:51.520 --> 06:53.240\n just continues to improve.\n\n06:53.240 --> 06:56.200\n And we don't have to think too hard\n\n06:56.200 --> 06:59.200\n about what we're doing as, say,\n\n06:59.200 --> 07:00.520\n a software designer or something like that.\n\n07:00.520 --> 07:02.200\n I absolutely don't mean to say\n\n07:02.200 --> 07:05.960\n that there's no innovation in software or the user side\n\n07:05.960 --> 07:07.040\n of things, of course there is.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:09.400\n But from the hardware perspective,\n\n07:09.400 --> 07:12.240\n we just have been given this gift\n\n07:12.240 --> 07:14.520\n of continued performance improvement\n\n07:14.520 --> 07:19.080\n through this scaling that is ever smaller feature sizes\n\n07:19.080 --> 07:22.680\n with very similar, say, power consumption.\n\n07:22.680 --> 07:25.880\n That power consumption has not continued to scale\n\n07:25.880 --> 07:29.360\n in the most recent decades, but nevertheless,\n\n07:29.360 --> 07:31.200\n we had a really good run there for a while.\n\n07:31.200 --> 07:34.160\n And now we're down to gates that are seven nanometers,\n\n07:34.160 --> 07:36.080\n which is state of the art right now.\n\n07:36.080 --> 07:38.760\n Maybe GlobalFoundries is trying to push it\n\n07:38.760 --> 07:39.600\n even lower than that.\n\n07:39.600 --> 07:42.440\n I can't keep up with where the predictions are\n\n07:42.440 --> 07:43.280\n that it's gonna end.\n\n07:43.280 --> 07:48.280\n But seven nanometer transistor has just a few tens of atoms\n\n07:49.880 --> 07:51.720\n along the length of the conduction pathway.\n\n07:51.720 --> 07:56.640\n So a naive semiconductor device physicist\n\n07:56.640 --> 07:58.560\n would think you can't go much further than that\n\n07:58.560 --> 08:02.240\n without some kind of revolution in the way we think\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:03.800\n about the physics of our devices.\n\n08:03.800 --> 08:04.960\n Is there something to be said\n\n08:04.960 --> 08:08.160\n about the mass manufacture of these devices?\n\n08:08.160 --> 08:09.320\n Right, right, so that's another thing.\n\n08:09.320 --> 08:10.800\n So how have we been able\n\n08:10.800 --> 08:13.840\n to make those transistors smaller and smaller?\n\n08:13.840 --> 08:17.720\n Well, companies like Intel, GlobalFoundries,\n\n08:17.720 --> 08:20.280\n they invest a lot of money in the lithography.\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:22.800\n So how are these chips actually made?\n\n08:22.800 --> 08:24.320\n Well, one of the most important steps\n\n08:24.320 --> 08:27.640\n is this what's called ion implantation.\n\n08:27.640 --> 08:31.920\n So you start with sort of a pristine silicon crystal\n\n08:31.920 --> 08:34.040\n and then using photolithography,\n\n08:34.040 --> 08:36.440\n which is a technique where you can pattern\n\n08:36.440 --> 08:38.760\n different shapes using light,\n\n08:38.760 --> 08:41.360\n you can define which regions of space\n\n08:41.360 --> 08:45.600\n you're going to implant with different species of ions\n\n08:45.600 --> 08:46.560\n that are going to change\n\n08:46.560 --> 08:49.520\n the local electrical properties right there.\n\n08:49.520 --> 08:52.640\n So by using ever shorter wavelengths of light\n\n08:52.640 --> 08:54.360\n and different kinds of optical techniques\n\n08:54.360 --> 08:56.560\n and different kinds of lithographic techniques,\n\n08:56.560 --> 09:00.920\n things that go far beyond my knowledge base,\n\n09:00.920 --> 09:03.280\n you can just simply shrink that feature size down.\n\n09:03.280 --> 09:04.640\n And you say you're at seven nanometers.\n\n09:04.640 --> 09:07.200\n Well, the wavelength of light that's being used\n\n09:07.200 --> 09:08.560\n is over a hundred nanometers.\n\n09:08.560 --> 09:10.040\n That's already deep in the UV.\n\n09:10.040 --> 09:14.520\n So how are those minute features patterned?\n\n09:14.520 --> 09:16.720\n Well, there's an extraordinary amount of innovation\n\n09:16.720 --> 09:18.000\n that has gone into that,\n\n09:18.000 --> 09:20.080\n but nevertheless, it stayed very consistent\n\n09:20.080 --> 09:21.720\n in this ever shrinking feature size.\n\n09:21.720 --> 09:24.560\n And now the question is, can you make it smaller?\n\n09:24.560 --> 09:26.760\n And even if you do, do you still continue\n\n09:26.760 --> 09:28.120\n to get performance improvements?\n\n09:28.120 --> 09:30.040\n But that's another kind of scaling\n\n09:30.040 --> 09:34.080\n where these companies have been able to...\n\n09:34.080 --> 09:36.840\n So, okay, you picture a chip that has a processor on it.\n\n09:36.840 --> 09:38.600\n Well, that chip is not made as a chip.\n\n09:38.600 --> 09:40.680\n It's made on a wafer.\n\n09:40.680 --> 09:43.160\n And using photolithography,\n\n09:43.160 --> 09:47.000\n you basically print the same pattern on different dyes\n\n09:47.000 --> 09:49.160\n all across the wafer, multiple layers,\n\n09:49.160 --> 09:53.120\n tens, probably a hundred some layers\n\n09:53.120 --> 09:55.000\n in a mature foundry process.\n\n09:55.000 --> 09:57.360\n And you do this on ever bigger wafers too.\n\n09:57.360 --> 09:58.800\n That's another aspect of scaling\n\n09:58.800 --> 10:00.680\n that's occurred in the last several decades.\n\n10:00.680 --> 10:02.720\n So now you have this 300 millimeter wafer.\n\n10:02.720 --> 10:04.040\n It's like as big as a pizza\n\n10:04.040 --> 10:06.360\n and it has maybe a thousand processors on it.\n\n10:06.360 --> 10:08.640\n And then you dice that up using a saw.\n\n10:08.640 --> 10:11.520\n And now you can sell these things so cheap\n\n10:11.520 --> 10:14.920\n because the manufacturing process was so streamlined.\n\n10:14.920 --> 10:17.160\n I think a technology as revolutionary\n\n10:17.160 --> 10:19.880\n as silicon microelectronics has to have\n\n10:19.880 --> 10:23.480\n that kind of manufacturing scalability,\n\n10:23.480 --> 10:25.400\n which I will just emphasize,\n\n10:25.400 --> 10:28.920\n I believe is enabled by physics.\n\n10:28.920 --> 10:31.480\n It's not, I mean, of course there's human ingenuity\n\n10:31.480 --> 10:35.840\n that goes into it, but at least from my side where I sit,\n\n10:35.840 --> 10:38.760\n it sure looks like the physics of our universe\n\n10:38.760 --> 10:40.880\n allows us to produce that.\n\n10:40.880 --> 10:45.720\n And we've discovered how more so than we've invented it,\n\n10:45.720 --> 10:47.160\n although of course we have invented it,\n\n10:47.160 --> 10:48.440\n humans have invented it,\n\n10:48.440 --> 10:50.960\n but it's almost as if it was there\n\n10:50.960 --> 10:52.960\n waiting for us to discover it.\n\n10:52.960 --> 10:54.160\n You mean the entirety of it\n\n10:54.160 --> 10:55.920\n or are you specifically talking about\n\n10:55.920 --> 10:58.320\n the techniques of photolithography,\n\n10:58.320 --> 10:59.680\n like the optics involved?\n\n10:59.680 --> 11:02.560\n I mean, the entirety of the scaling down\n\n11:02.560 --> 11:04.320\n to the seven nanometers,\n\n11:04.320 --> 11:08.200\n you're able to have electrons not interfere with each other\n\n11:08.200 --> 11:11.280\n in such a way that you could still have gates.\n\n11:11.280 --> 11:13.320\n Like that's enabled.\n\n11:13.320 --> 11:16.560\n To achieve that scale, spatial and temporal,\n\n11:16.560 --> 11:18.720\n it seems to be very special\n\n11:18.720 --> 11:21.480\n and is enabled by the physics of our world.\n\n11:21.480 --> 11:22.760\n All of the things you just said.\n\n11:22.760 --> 11:25.960\n So starting with the silicon material itself,\n\n11:25.960 --> 11:28.760\n silicon is a unique semiconductor.\n\n11:28.760 --> 11:31.560\n It has essentially ideal properties\n\n11:31.560 --> 11:33.720\n for making a specific kind of transistor\n\n11:33.720 --> 11:35.200\n that's extraordinarily useful.\n\n11:35.200 --> 11:39.560\n So I mentioned that silicon has,\n\n11:39.560 --> 11:40.640\n well, when you make a transistor,\n\n11:40.640 --> 11:42.000\n you have this gate contact\n\n11:42.000 --> 11:44.520\n that sits on top of the conduction channel.\n\n11:44.520 --> 11:47.240\n And depending on the voltage you apply there,\n\n11:47.240 --> 11:50.000\n you pull more carriers into the conduction channel\n\n11:50.000 --> 11:53.040\n or push them away so it becomes more or less conductive.\n\n11:53.040 --> 11:54.680\n In order to have that work\n\n11:54.680 --> 11:57.120\n without just sucking those carriers right into that contact,\n\n11:57.120 --> 11:59.080\n you need a very thin insulator.\n\n11:59.080 --> 12:03.200\n And part of scaling has been to gradually decrease\n\n12:03.200 --> 12:06.040\n the thickness of that gate insulator\n\n12:06.040 --> 12:09.040\n so that you can use a roughly similar voltage\n\n12:09.040 --> 12:12.080\n and still have the same current voltage characteristics.\n\n12:12.080 --> 12:14.600\n So the material that's used to do that,\n\n12:14.600 --> 12:16.880\n or I should say was initially used to do that\n\n12:16.880 --> 12:18.720\n was a silicon dioxide,\n\n12:18.720 --> 12:21.800\n which just naturally grows on the silicon surface.\n\n12:21.800 --> 12:25.080\n So you expose silicon to the atmosphere that we breathe\n\n12:25.080 --> 12:27.560\n and well, if you're manufacturing,\n\n12:27.560 --> 12:29.720\n you're gonna purify these gases,\n\n12:29.720 --> 12:30.560\n but nevertheless,\n\n12:30.560 --> 12:33.520\n that what's called a native oxide will grow there.\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:36.040\n There are essentially no other materials\n\n12:36.040 --> 12:37.480\n on the entire periodic table\n\n12:37.480 --> 12:42.360\n that have as good of a gate insulator\n\n12:42.360 --> 12:43.680\n as that silicon dioxide.\n\n12:43.680 --> 12:46.280\n And that has to do with nothing but the physics\n\n12:46.280 --> 12:49.240\n of the interaction between silicon and oxygen.\n\n12:49.240 --> 12:51.240\n And if it wasn't that way,\n\n12:51.240 --> 12:54.720\n transistors could not perform\n\n12:54.720 --> 12:58.800\n in nearly the degree of capability that they have.\n\n12:58.800 --> 13:02.880\n And that has to do with the way that the oxide grows,\n\n13:02.880 --> 13:05.760\n the reduced density of defects there,\n\n13:05.760 --> 13:08.600\n it's insulation, meaning essentially it's energy gaps.\n\n13:08.600 --> 13:10.320\n You can apply a very large voltage there\n\n13:10.320 --> 13:12.280\n without having current leak through it.\n\n13:12.280 --> 13:14.520\n So that's physics right there.\n\n13:15.760 --> 13:16.880\n There are other things too.\n\n13:16.880 --> 13:19.840\n Silicon is a semiconductor in an elemental sense.\n\n13:19.840 --> 13:21.560\n You only need silicon atoms.\n\n13:21.560 --> 13:22.800\n A lot of other semiconductors,\n\n13:22.800 --> 13:24.880\n you need two different kinds of atoms,\n\n13:24.880 --> 13:26.800\n like a compound from group three\n\n13:26.800 --> 13:28.560\n and a compound from group five.\n\n13:28.560 --> 13:31.680\n That opens you up to lots of defects that can occur\n\n13:31.680 --> 13:34.360\n where one atom's not sitting quite at the lattice site,\n\n13:34.360 --> 13:35.960\n it is and it's switched with another one\n\n13:35.960 --> 13:38.280\n that degrades performance.\n\n13:38.280 --> 13:40.280\n But then also on the side that you mentioned\n\n13:40.280 --> 13:42.040\n with the manufacturing,\n\n13:43.480 --> 13:45.840\n we have access to light sources\n\n13:45.840 --> 13:48.560\n that can produce these very short wavelengths of light.\n\n13:49.480 --> 13:50.880\n How does photolithography occur?\n\n13:50.880 --> 13:54.440\n Well, you actually put this polymer on top of your wafer\n\n13:54.440 --> 13:56.200\n and you expose it to light,\n\n13:56.200 --> 14:00.080\n and then you use a aqueous chemical processing\n\n14:00.080 --> 14:03.440\n to dissolve away the regions that were exposed to light\n\n14:03.440 --> 14:05.920\n and leave the regions that were not.\n\n14:05.920 --> 14:08.520\n And we are blessed with these polymers\n\n14:08.520 --> 14:09.640\n that have the right property\n\n14:09.640 --> 14:13.560\n where they can cause scission events\n\n14:13.560 --> 14:16.160\n where the polymer splits where a photon hits.\n\n14:16.160 --> 14:19.720\n I mean, maybe that's not too surprising,\n\n14:19.720 --> 14:21.520\n but I don't know, it all comes together\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:24.240\n to have this really complex,\n\n14:24.240 --> 14:26.120\n manufacturable ecosystem\n\n14:26.120 --> 14:30.600\n where very sophisticated technologies can be devised\n\n14:30.600 --> 14:33.000\n and it works quite well.\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:34.360\n And amazingly, like you said,\n\n14:34.360 --> 14:36.240\n with a wavelength at like 100 nanometers\n\n14:36.240 --> 14:37.080\n or something like that,\n\n14:37.080 --> 14:39.720\n you're still able to achieve on this polymer\n\n14:39.720 --> 14:43.440\n precision of whatever we said, seven nanometers.\n\n14:43.440 --> 14:45.720\n I think I've heard like four nanometers\n\n14:45.720 --> 14:48.400\n being talked about, something like that.\n\n14:48.400 --> 14:49.800\n If we could just pause on this\n\n14:49.800 --> 14:52.080\n and we'll return to superconductivity,\n\n14:52.080 --> 14:56.360\n but in this whole journey from a history perspective,\n\n14:56.360 --> 14:58.400\n what do you think is the most beautiful\n\n14:59.440 --> 15:01.680\n at the intersection of engineering and physics\n\n15:01.680 --> 15:03.240\n to you in this whole process\n\n15:03.240 --> 15:06.520\n that we talked about with silicon and photolithography,\n\n15:06.520 --> 15:08.320\n things that people were able to achieve\n\n15:08.320 --> 15:12.280\n in order to push Moore's law forward?\n\n15:12.280 --> 15:13.640\n Is it the early days,\n\n15:13.640 --> 15:16.240\n the invention of the transistor itself?\n\n15:16.240 --> 15:19.280\n Is it some particular cool little thing\n\n15:19.280 --> 15:21.960\n that maybe not many people know about?\n\n15:21.960 --> 15:24.480\n Like, what do you think is most beautiful\n\n15:24.480 --> 15:26.760\n in this whole process, journey?\n\n15:26.760 --> 15:29.560\n The most beautiful is a little difficult to answer.\n\n15:29.560 --> 15:32.040\n Let me try and sidestep it a little bit\n\n15:32.040 --> 15:35.840\n and just say what strikes me about looking\n\n15:35.840 --> 15:40.840\n at the history of silicon microelectronics is that,\n\n15:42.000 --> 15:44.600\n so when quantum mechanics was developed,\n\n15:44.600 --> 15:47.440\n people quickly began applying it to semiconductors\n\n15:47.440 --> 15:49.360\n and it was broadly understood\n\n15:49.360 --> 15:50.760\n that these are fascinating systems\n\n15:50.760 --> 15:52.720\n and people cared about them for their basic physics,\n\n15:52.720 --> 15:55.040\n but also their utility as devices.\n\n15:55.040 --> 15:59.280\n And then the transistor was invented in the late forties\n\n15:59.280 --> 16:02.080\n in a relatively crude experimental setup\n\n16:02.080 --> 16:04.280\n where you just crammed a metal electrode\n\n16:04.280 --> 16:08.040\n into the semiconductor and that was ingenious.\n\n16:08.040 --> 16:11.920\n These people were able to make it work.\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:16.840\n But so what I wanna get to that really strikes me\n\n16:16.840 --> 16:19.320\n is that in those early days,\n\n16:19.320 --> 16:21.200\n there were a number of different semiconductors\n\n16:21.200 --> 16:22.120\n that were being considered.\n\n16:22.120 --> 16:23.840\n They had different properties, different strengths,\n\n16:23.840 --> 16:24.920\n different weaknesses.\n\n16:24.920 --> 16:28.480\n Most people thought germanium was the way to go.\n\n16:28.480 --> 16:33.480\n It had some nice properties related to things\n\n16:33.680 --> 16:37.320\n about how the electrons move inside the lattice.\n\n16:37.320 --> 16:39.800\n But other people thought that compound semiconductors\n\n16:39.800 --> 16:42.000\n with group three and group five also had\n\n16:42.000 --> 16:46.240\n really, really extraordinary properties\n\n16:46.240 --> 16:50.080\n that might be conducive to making the best devices.\n\n16:50.080 --> 16:52.560\n So there were different groups exploring each of these\n\n16:52.560 --> 16:54.240\n and that's great, that's how science works.\n\n16:54.240 --> 16:56.160\n You have to cast a broad net.\n\n16:56.160 --> 17:01.160\n But then what I find striking is why is it that silicon won?\n\n17:02.120 --> 17:05.280\n Because it's not that germanium is a useless material\n\n17:05.280 --> 17:06.760\n and it's not present in technology\n\n17:06.760 --> 17:08.080\n or compound semiconductors.\n\n17:08.080 --> 17:12.640\n They're both doing exciting and important things,\n\n17:12.640 --> 17:14.400\n slightly more niche applications\n\n17:14.400 --> 17:18.080\n whereas silicon is the semiconductor material\n\n17:18.080 --> 17:20.120\n for microelectronics which is the platform\n\n17:20.120 --> 17:22.760\n for digital computing which has transformed our world.\n\n17:22.760 --> 17:24.200\n Why did silicon win?\n\n17:24.200 --> 17:28.720\n It's because of a remarkable assemblage of qualities\n\n17:28.720 --> 17:32.120\n that no one of them was the clear winner\n\n17:32.120 --> 17:34.560\n but it made these sort of compromises\n\n17:34.560 --> 17:36.680\n between a number of different influences.\n\n17:36.680 --> 17:40.520\n It had that really excellent gate oxide\n\n17:40.520 --> 17:43.240\n that allowed us to make MOSFETs,\n\n17:43.240 --> 17:45.400\n these high performance transistors,\n\n17:45.400 --> 17:47.200\n so quickly and cheaply and easily\n\n17:47.200 --> 17:49.360\n without having to do a lot of materials development.\n\n17:49.360 --> 17:53.400\n The band gap of silicon is actually,\n\n17:53.400 --> 17:56.280\n so in a semiconductor there's an important parameter\n\n17:56.280 --> 17:57.480\n which is called the band gap\n\n17:57.480 --> 18:00.600\n which tells you there are sort of electrons\n\n18:00.600 --> 18:04.600\n that fill up to one level in the energy diagram\n\n18:04.600 --> 18:06.800\n and then there's a gap where electrons aren't allowed\n\n18:06.800 --> 18:08.280\n to have an energy in a certain range\n\n18:08.280 --> 18:11.320\n and then there's another energy level above that.\n\n18:11.320 --> 18:14.960\n And that difference between the lower sort of filled level\n\n18:14.960 --> 18:16.880\n and the unoccupied level,\n\n18:16.880 --> 18:19.640\n that tells you how much voltage you have to apply\n\n18:19.640 --> 18:22.160\n in order to induce a current to flow.\n\n18:22.160 --> 18:27.160\n So with germanium, that's about 0.75 electron volts.\n\n18:27.320 --> 18:29.640\n That means you have to apply 0.75 volts\n\n18:29.640 --> 18:32.000\n to get a current moving.\n\n18:32.000 --> 18:34.280\n And it turns out that if you compare that\n\n18:34.280 --> 18:38.520\n to the thermal excitations that are induced\n\n18:38.520 --> 18:40.680\n just by the temperature of our environment,\n\n18:40.680 --> 18:42.120\n that gap's not quite big enough.\n\n18:42.120 --> 18:45.120\n You start to use it to perform computations,\n\n18:45.120 --> 18:47.640\n it gets a little hot and you get all these accidental\n\n18:47.640 --> 18:50.720\n carriers that are excited into the conduction band\n\n18:50.720 --> 18:53.360\n and it causes errors in your computation.\n\n18:53.360 --> 18:56.200\n Silicon's band gap is just a little higher,\n\n18:56.200 --> 18:58.960\n 1.1 electron volts,\n\n18:58.960 --> 19:01.280\n but you have an exponential dependence\n\n19:01.280 --> 19:04.200\n on the number of carriers that are present\n\n19:04.200 --> 19:06.600\n that can induce those errors.\n\n19:06.600 --> 19:08.480\n It decays exponentially with that voltage.\n\n19:08.480 --> 19:12.760\n So just that slight extra energy in that band gap\n\n19:12.760 --> 19:17.040\n really puts it in an ideal position to be operated\n\n19:17.040 --> 19:20.200\n in the conditions of our ambient environment.\n\n19:20.200 --> 19:22.440\n It's kind of fascinating that, like you mentioned,\n\n19:22.440 --> 19:27.440\n errors decrease exponentially with the voltage.\n\n19:27.500 --> 19:32.040\n So it's funny because this error thing comes up\n\n19:32.040 --> 19:34.600\n when you start talking about quantum computing.\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:36.020\n And it's kind of amazing that everything\n\n19:36.020 --> 19:37.920\n we've been talking about, the errors,\n\n19:37.920 --> 19:41.480\n as we scale down, seems to be extremely low.\n\n19:41.480 --> 19:42.320\n Yes.\n\n19:42.320 --> 19:45.960\n And like all of our computation is based\n\n19:45.960 --> 19:47.760\n on the assumption that it's extremely low.\n\n19:47.760 --> 19:49.560\n Yes, well it's digital computation.\n\n19:49.560 --> 19:51.480\n Digital, sorry, digital computation.\n\n19:51.480 --> 19:55.000\n So as opposed to our biological computation in our brain,\n\n19:55.000 --> 19:58.240\n is like the assumption is stuff is gonna fail\n\n19:58.240 --> 19:59.800\n all over the place and we somehow\n\n19:59.800 --> 20:01.720\n have to still be robust to that.\n\n20:01.720 --> 20:03.060\n That's exactly right.\n\n20:03.060 --> 20:05.820\n So this also, this is gonna be the most controversial part\n\n20:05.820 --> 20:07.800\n of our conversation where you're gonna make some enemies.\n\n20:07.800 --> 20:09.040\n So let me ask,\n\n20:09.040 --> 20:12.040\n because we've been talking about physics and engineering.\n\n20:14.040 --> 20:15.760\n Which group of people is smarter\n\n20:15.760 --> 20:17.800\n and more important for this one?\n\n20:17.800 --> 20:20.560\n Let me ask the question in a better way.\n\n20:20.560 --> 20:22.560\n Some of the big innovations,\n\n20:22.560 --> 20:25.720\n some of the beautiful things that we've been talking about,\n\n20:25.720 --> 20:26.960\n how much of it is physics?\n\n20:26.960 --> 20:28.440\n How much of it is engineering?\n\n20:28.440 --> 20:31.640\n My dad is a physicist and he talks down\n\n20:31.640 --> 20:34.400\n to all the amazing engineering that we're doing\n\n20:34.400 --> 20:37.920\n in the artificial intelligence and the computer science\n\n20:37.920 --> 20:39.560\n and the robotics and all that space.\n\n20:39.560 --> 20:41.640\n So we argue about this all the time.\n\n20:41.640 --> 20:42.480\n So what do you think?\n\n20:42.480 --> 20:43.920\n Who gets more credit?\n\n20:43.920 --> 20:46.760\n I'm genuinely not trying to just be politically correct here.\n\n20:46.760 --> 20:50.480\n I don't see how you would have any of the,\n\n20:50.480 --> 20:52.600\n what we consider sort of the great accomplishments\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:54.120\n of society without both.\n\n20:54.120 --> 20:55.880\n You absolutely need both of those things.\n\n20:55.880 --> 20:59.640\n Physics tends to play a key role earlier in the development\n\n20:59.640 --> 21:04.640\n and then engineering optimization, these things take over.\n\n21:04.640 --> 21:09.220\n And I mean, the invention of the transistor\n\n21:09.220 --> 21:10.840\n or actually even before that,\n\n21:10.840 --> 21:12.840\n the understanding of semiconductor physics\n\n21:12.840 --> 21:14.800\n that allowed the invention of the transistor,\n\n21:14.800 --> 21:15.640\n that's all physics.\n\n21:15.640 --> 21:17.000\n So if you didn't have that physics,\n\n21:17.000 --> 21:20.300\n you don't even get to get on the field.\n\n21:20.300 --> 21:24.200\n But once you have understood and demonstrated\n\n21:24.200 --> 21:26.520\n that this is in principle possible,\n\n21:26.520 --> 21:28.400\n more so as engineering.\n\n21:28.400 --> 21:32.200\n Why we have computers more powerful\n\n21:32.200 --> 21:36.400\n than old supercomputers in each of our phones,\n\n21:36.400 --> 21:37.520\n that's all engineering.\n\n21:37.520 --> 21:41.720\n And I think I would be quite foolish to say\n\n21:41.720 --> 21:46.720\n that that's not valuable, that's not a great contribution.\n\n21:46.920 --> 21:47.800\n It's a beautiful dance.\n\n21:47.800 --> 21:49.740\n Would you put like Silicon,\n\n21:49.740 --> 21:52.760\n the understanding of the material properties\n\n21:52.760 --> 21:54.320\n in the space of engineering?\n\n21:54.320 --> 21:55.680\n Like how does that whole process work?\n\n21:55.680 --> 21:58.000\n To understand that it has all these nice properties\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:02.240\n or even the development of photolithography,\n\n22:02.240 --> 22:03.840\n is that basically,\n\n22:03.840 --> 22:06.140\n would you put that in a category of engineering?\n\n22:06.140 --> 22:09.960\n No, I would say that it is basic physics,\n\n22:09.960 --> 22:12.760\n it is applied physics, it's material science,\n\n22:12.760 --> 22:17.640\n it's X ray crystallography, it's polymer chemistry,\n\n22:17.640 --> 22:18.800\n it's everything.\n\n22:18.800 --> 22:20.280\n Chemistry even is thrown in there?\n\n22:20.280 --> 22:22.580\n Absolutely, yes, absolutely.\n\n22:22.580 --> 22:23.840\n Just no biology.\n\n22:25.320 --> 22:26.560\n We can get to biology.\n\n22:26.560 --> 22:28.240\n Or the biologies and the humans\n\n22:28.240 --> 22:29.480\n that are engineering the system,\n\n22:29.480 --> 22:31.200\n so it's all integrated deeply.\n\n22:31.200 --> 22:32.560\n Okay, so let's return,\n\n22:32.560 --> 22:35.640\n you mentioned this word superconductivity.\n\n22:35.640 --> 22:38.600\n So what does that have to do with what we're talking about?\n\n22:38.600 --> 22:40.560\n Right, okay, so in a semiconductor,\n\n22:40.560 --> 22:44.280\n as I tried to describe a second ago,\n\n22:44.280 --> 22:49.280\n you can sort of induce currents by applying voltages\n\n22:50.040 --> 22:52.280\n and those have sort of typical properties\n\n22:52.280 --> 22:55.400\n that you would expect from some kind of a conductor.\n\n22:55.400 --> 22:59.000\n Those electrons, they don't just flow\n\n22:59.000 --> 23:00.360\n perfectly without dissipation.\n\n23:00.360 --> 23:03.240\n If an electron collides with an imperfection in the lattice\n\n23:03.240 --> 23:05.600\n or another electron, it's gonna slow down,\n\n23:05.600 --> 23:06.880\n it's gonna lose its momentum.\n\n23:06.880 --> 23:09.280\n So you have to keep applying that voltage\n\n23:09.280 --> 23:11.440\n in order to keep the current flowing.\n\n23:11.440 --> 23:13.440\n In a superconductor, something different happens.\n\n23:13.440 --> 23:16.520\n If you get a current to start flowing,\n\n23:16.520 --> 23:18.280\n it will continue to flow indefinitely.\n\n23:18.280 --> 23:19.880\n There's no dissipation.\n\n23:19.880 --> 23:21.660\n So that's crazy.\n\n23:21.660 --> 23:22.500\n How does that happen?\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:26.800\n Well, it happens at low temperature and this is crucial.\n\n23:26.800 --> 23:30.200\n It has to be a quite low temperature\n\n23:30.200 --> 23:32.840\n and what I'm talking about there,\n\n23:32.840 --> 23:35.800\n for essentially all of our conversation,\n\n23:35.800 --> 23:38.780\n I'm gonna be talking about conventional superconductors,\n\n23:39.800 --> 23:42.240\n sometimes called low TC superconductors,\n\n23:42.240 --> 23:45.120\n low critical temperature superconductors.\n\n23:45.120 --> 23:50.120\n And so those materials have to be at a temperature around,\n\n23:50.640 --> 23:51.960\n say around four Kelvin.\n\n23:51.960 --> 23:54.560\n I mean, their critical temperature might be 10 Kelvin,\n\n23:54.560 --> 23:55.400\n something like that,\n\n23:55.400 --> 23:57.120\n but you wanna operate them at around four Kelvin,\n\n23:57.120 --> 23:59.280\n four degrees above absolute zero.\n\n23:59.280 --> 24:01.640\n And what happens at that temperature,\n\n24:01.640 --> 24:03.880\n at very low temperatures in certain materials\n\n24:03.880 --> 24:08.880\n is that the noise of atoms moving around,\n\n24:10.080 --> 24:13.580\n the lattice vibrating, electrons colliding with each other,\n\n24:13.580 --> 24:15.120\n that becomes sufficiently low\n\n24:15.120 --> 24:18.600\n that the electrons can settle into this very special state.\n\n24:18.600 --> 24:22.280\n It's sometimes referred to as a macroscopic quantum state\n\n24:22.280 --> 24:26.560\n because if I had a piece of superconducting material here,\n\n24:26.560 --> 24:30.920\n let's say niobium is a very typical superconductor.\n\n24:30.920 --> 24:33.640\n If I had a block of niobium here\n\n24:33.640 --> 24:36.700\n and we cooled it below its critical temperature,\n\n24:36.700 --> 24:40.840\n all of the electrons in that superconducting state\n\n24:40.840 --> 24:42.840\n would be in one coherent quantum state.\n\n24:42.840 --> 24:47.520\n The wave function of that state is described\n\n24:47.520 --> 24:49.760\n in terms of all of the particles simultaneously,\n\n24:49.760 --> 24:52.220\n but it extends across macroscopic dimensions,\n\n24:52.220 --> 24:56.120\n the size of whatever block of that material\n\n24:56.120 --> 24:57.040\n I have sitting here.\n\n24:57.040 --> 24:59.460\n And the way this occurs is that,\n\n25:01.220 --> 25:03.480\n let's try to be a little bit light on the technical details,\n\n25:03.480 --> 25:06.520\n but essentially the electrons coordinate with each other.\n\n25:06.520 --> 25:10.300\n They are able to, in this macroscopic quantum state,\n\n25:10.300 --> 25:12.260\n they're able to sort of,\n\n25:12.260 --> 25:14.400\n one can quickly take the place of the other.\n\n25:14.400 --> 25:15.800\n You can't tell electrons apart.\n\n25:15.800 --> 25:17.740\n They're what's known as identical particles.\n\n25:17.740 --> 25:22.040\n So if this electron runs into a defect\n\n25:22.040 --> 25:25.000\n that would otherwise cause it to scatter,\n\n25:25.000 --> 25:30.000\n it can just sort of almost miraculously avoid that defect\n\n25:30.440 --> 25:32.240\n because it's not really in that location.\n\n25:32.240 --> 25:34.000\n It's part of a macroscopic quantum state\n\n25:34.000 --> 25:35.660\n and the entire quantum state\n\n25:35.660 --> 25:37.160\n was not scattered by that defect.\n\n25:37.160 --> 25:40.780\n So you can get a current that flows without dissipation\n\n25:40.780 --> 25:42.960\n and that's called a supercurrent.\n\n25:42.960 --> 25:47.840\n That's sort of just very much scratching the surface\n\n25:47.840 --> 25:49.840\n of superconductivity.\n\n25:49.840 --> 25:52.240\n There's very deep and rich physics there,\n\n25:52.240 --> 25:54.520\n just probably not the main subject\n\n25:54.520 --> 25:55.640\n we need to go into right now.\n\n25:55.640 --> 26:00.520\n But it turns out that when you have this material,\n\n26:00.520 --> 26:03.560\n you can do usual things like make wires out of it\n\n26:03.560 --> 26:06.440\n so you can get current to flow in a straight line on a chip,\n\n26:06.440 --> 26:08.920\n but you can also make other devices\n\n26:08.920 --> 26:11.880\n that perform different kinds of operations.\n\n26:11.880 --> 26:14.760\n Some of them are kind of logic operations\n\n26:14.760 --> 26:16.680\n like you'd get in a transistor.\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:19.860\n The most common or the most,\n\n26:21.200 --> 26:25.480\n I would say, diverse in its utility component\n\n26:25.480 --> 26:26.920\n is a Josephson junction.\n\n26:26.920 --> 26:28.980\n It's not analogous to a transistor\n\n26:28.980 --> 26:31.480\n in the sense that if you apply a voltage here,\n\n26:31.480 --> 26:33.880\n it changes how much current flows from left to right,\n\n26:33.880 --> 26:36.360\n but it is analogous in sort of a sense\n\n26:36.360 --> 26:39.200\n of it's the go to component\n\n26:39.200 --> 26:42.040\n that a circuit engineer is going to use\n\n26:42.040 --> 26:44.520\n to start to build up more complexity.\n\n26:44.520 --> 26:48.840\n So these junctions serve as gates.\n\n26:48.840 --> 26:50.680\n They can serve as gates.\n\n26:50.680 --> 26:55.680\n So I'm not sure how concerned to be with semantics,\n\n26:55.680 --> 26:58.880\n but let me just briefly say what a Josephson junction is\n\n26:58.880 --> 27:02.240\n and we can talk about different ways that they can be used.\n\n27:02.240 --> 27:05.280\n Basically, if you have a superconducting wire\n\n27:05.280 --> 27:09.680\n and then a small gap of a different material\n\n27:09.680 --> 27:13.520\n that's not superconducting, an insulator or normal metal,\n\n27:13.520 --> 27:15.800\n and then another superconducting wire on the other side,\n\n27:15.800 --> 27:17.040\n that's a Josephson junction.\n\n27:17.040 --> 27:18.600\n So it's sometimes referred to\n\n27:18.600 --> 27:20.320\n as a superconducting weak link.\n\n27:20.320 --> 27:24.200\n So you have this superconducting state on one side\n\n27:24.200 --> 27:27.520\n and on the other side, and the superconducting wave function\n\n27:27.520 --> 27:30.720\n actually tunnels across that gap.\n\n27:30.720 --> 27:35.460\n And when you create such a physical entity,\n\n27:35.460 --> 27:40.460\n it has very unusual current voltage characteristics.\n\n27:41.360 --> 27:44.320\n In that gap, like weird stuff happens.\n\n27:44.320 --> 27:45.160\n Through the entire circuit.\n\n27:45.160 --> 27:47.600\n So you can imagine, suppose you had a loop set up\n\n27:47.600 --> 27:51.240\n that had one of those weak links in the loop.\n\n27:51.240 --> 27:53.800\n Current would flow in that loop independent,\n\n27:53.800 --> 27:55.640\n even if you hadn't applied a voltage to it,\n\n27:55.640 --> 27:57.060\n and that's called the Josephson effect.\n\n27:57.060 --> 28:00.520\n So the fact that there's this phase difference\n\n28:00.520 --> 28:02.940\n in the quantum wave function from one side\n\n28:02.940 --> 28:04.400\n of the tunneling barrier to the other\n\n28:04.400 --> 28:05.720\n induces current to flow.\n\n28:05.720 --> 28:07.720\n So how does you change state?\n\n28:07.720 --> 28:08.560\n Right, exactly.\n\n28:08.560 --> 28:09.560\n So how do you change state?\n\n28:09.560 --> 28:13.880\n Now picture if I have a current bias coming down\n\n28:13.880 --> 28:16.120\n this line of my circuit and there's a Josephson junction\n\n28:16.120 --> 28:18.120\n right in the middle of it.\n\n28:18.120 --> 28:19.960\n And now I make another wire\n\n28:19.960 --> 28:21.800\n that goes around the Josephson junction.\n\n28:21.800 --> 28:24.600\n So I have a loop here, a superconducting loop.\n\n28:24.600 --> 28:28.960\n I can add current to that loop by exceeding\n\n28:28.960 --> 28:30.860\n the critical current of that Josephson junction.\n\n28:30.860 --> 28:33.980\n So like any superconducting material,\n\n28:34.960 --> 28:37.700\n it can carry this supercurrent that I've described,\n\n28:37.700 --> 28:40.520\n this current that can propagate without dissipation\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:41.840\n up to a certain level.\n\n28:41.840 --> 28:44.240\n And if you try and pass more current than that\n\n28:44.240 --> 28:47.520\n through the material, it's going to become\n\n28:47.520 --> 28:51.140\n a resistive material, normal material.\n\n28:51.140 --> 28:54.140\n So in the Josephson junction, the same thing happens.\n\n28:54.140 --> 28:57.120\n I can bias it above its critical current.\n\n28:57.120 --> 28:58.220\n And then what it's going to do,\n\n28:58.220 --> 29:03.220\n it's going to add a quantized amount of current\n\n29:03.560 --> 29:04.400\n into that loop.\n\n29:04.400 --> 29:07.320\n And what I mean by quantized is it's going to come\n\n29:07.320 --> 29:11.200\n in discrete packets with a well defined value of current.\n\n29:11.200 --> 29:15.320\n So in the vernacular of some people working\n\n29:15.320 --> 29:19.520\n in this community, you would say you pop a flux on\n\n29:19.520 --> 29:20.360\n into the loop.\n\n29:20.360 --> 29:21.760\n So a flux on.\n\n29:21.760 --> 29:23.680\n You pop a flux on into the loop.\n\n29:23.680 --> 29:24.520\n Yeah, so a flux on.\n\n29:24.520 --> 29:26.560\n Sounds like skateboarder talk, I love it.\n\n29:26.560 --> 29:28.960\n Okay, sorry, go ahead.\n\n29:28.960 --> 29:33.640\n A flux on is one of these quantized sort of amounts\n\n29:33.640 --> 29:35.220\n of current that you can add to a loop.\n\n29:35.220 --> 29:36.600\n And this is a cartoon picture,\n\n29:36.600 --> 29:38.400\n but I think it's sufficient for our purposes.\n\n29:38.400 --> 29:40.780\n So which, maybe it's useful to say,\n\n29:41.700 --> 29:45.480\n what is the speed at which these discrete packets\n\n29:45.480 --> 29:47.000\n of current travel?\n\n29:47.000 --> 29:49.160\n Because we'll be talking about light a little bit.\n\n29:49.160 --> 29:51.080\n It seems like the speed is important.\n\n29:51.080 --> 29:53.560\n The speed is important, that's an excellent question.\n\n29:53.560 --> 29:57.800\n Sometimes I wonder where you, how you became so astute.\n\n29:57.800 --> 30:00.800\n But so this.\n\n30:00.800 --> 30:04.400\n Matrix 4 is coming out, so maybe that's related.\n\n30:04.400 --> 30:05.240\n I'm not sure.\n\n30:05.240 --> 30:06.400\n I'm dressed for the job.\n\n30:06.400 --> 30:09.360\n I was trying to get to become an extra on Matrix 4,\n\n30:09.360 --> 30:10.680\n didn't work out.\n\n30:10.680 --> 30:13.280\n Anyway, so what's the speed of these packets?\n\n30:13.280 --> 30:15.000\n You'll have to find another gig.\n\n30:15.000 --> 30:16.600\n I know, I'm sorry.\n\n30:16.600 --> 30:19.440\n So the speed of the pack is actually these flux ons,\n\n30:19.440 --> 30:24.300\n these sort of pulses of current\n\n30:24.300 --> 30:26.200\n that are generated by Joseph's injunctions,\n\n30:26.200 --> 30:28.480\n they can actually propagate very close\n\n30:28.480 --> 30:29.740\n to the speed of light,\n\n30:29.740 --> 30:31.920\n maybe something like a third of the speed of light.\n\n30:31.920 --> 30:32.880\n That's quite fast.\n\n30:32.880 --> 30:37.280\n So one of the reasons why Joseph's injunctions are appealing\n\n30:37.280 --> 30:40.600\n is because their signals can propagate quite fast\n\n30:40.600 --> 30:43.440\n and they can also switch very fast.\n\n30:43.440 --> 30:46.080\n What I mean by switch is perform that operation\n\n30:46.080 --> 30:49.440\n that I described where you add current to the loop.\n\n30:49.440 --> 30:53.960\n That can happen within a few tens of picoseconds.\n\n30:53.960 --> 30:56.880\n So you can get devices that operate\n\n30:56.880 --> 30:58.840\n in the hundreds of gigahertz range.\n\n30:58.840 --> 31:02.080\n And by comparison, most processors\n\n31:02.080 --> 31:04.960\n in our conventional computers operate closer\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:08.360\n to the one gigahertz range, maybe three gigahertz\n\n31:08.360 --> 31:12.960\n seems to be kind of where those speeds have leveled out.\n\n31:12.960 --> 31:15.600\n The gamers listening to this are getting really excited\n\n31:15.600 --> 31:18.080\n to overclock their system to like, what is it?\n\n31:18.080 --> 31:19.560\n Like four gigahertz or something,\n\n31:19.560 --> 31:21.980\n a hundred sounds incredible.\n\n31:21.980 --> 31:24.060\n Can I just as a tiny tangent,\n\n31:24.060 --> 31:26.880\n is the physics of this understood well\n\n31:26.880 --> 31:28.520\n how to do this stably?\n\n31:28.520 --> 31:30.160\n Oh yes, the physics is understood well.\n\n31:30.160 --> 31:32.540\n The physics of Joseph's injunctions is understood well.\n\n31:32.540 --> 31:34.520\n The technology is understood quite well too.\n\n31:34.520 --> 31:37.620\n The reasons why it hasn't displaced\n\n31:37.620 --> 31:41.720\n silicon microelectronics in conventional digital computing\n\n31:41.720 --> 31:45.040\n I think are more related to what I was alluding to before\n\n31:45.040 --> 31:49.240\n about the myriad practical, almost mundane aspects\n\n31:49.240 --> 31:52.080\n of silicon that make it so useful.\n\n31:52.080 --> 31:55.880\n You can make a transistor ever smaller and smaller\n\n31:55.880 --> 31:58.840\n and it will still perform its digital function quite well.\n\n31:58.840 --> 32:00.780\n The same is not true of a Joseph's injunction.\n\n32:00.780 --> 32:02.400\n You really, they don't, they just,\n\n32:02.400 --> 32:04.440\n it's not the same thing that there's this feature\n\n32:04.440 --> 32:06.280\n that you can keep making smaller and smaller\n\n32:06.280 --> 32:08.220\n and it'll keep performing the same operations.\n\n32:08.220 --> 32:11.480\n This loop I described, any Joseph's in circuit,\n\n32:11.480 --> 32:13.600\n well, I wanna be careful, I shouldn't say\n\n32:13.600 --> 32:17.240\n any Joseph's in circuit, but many Joseph's in circuits,\n\n32:17.240 --> 32:19.440\n the way they process information\n\n32:19.440 --> 32:21.280\n or the way they perform whatever function it is\n\n32:21.280 --> 32:22.120\n they're trying to do,\n\n32:22.120 --> 32:24.560\n maybe it's sensing a weak magnetic field,\n\n32:24.560 --> 32:27.480\n it depends on an interplay between the junction\n\n32:27.480 --> 32:28.800\n and that loop.\n\n32:28.800 --> 32:30.560\n And you can't make that loop much smaller.\n\n32:30.560 --> 32:32.120\n And it's not for practical reasons\n\n32:32.120 --> 32:33.480\n that have to do with lithography.\n\n32:33.480 --> 32:35.680\n It's for fundamental physical reasons\n\n32:35.680 --> 32:38.960\n about the way the magnetic field interacts\n\n32:38.960 --> 32:41.160\n with that superconducting material.\n\n32:41.160 --> 32:44.360\n There are physical limits that no matter how good\n\n32:44.360 --> 32:47.260\n our technology got, those circuits would,\n\n32:47.260 --> 32:50.360\n I think would never be able to be scaled down\n\n32:50.360 --> 32:54.360\n to the densities that silicon microelectronics can.\n\n32:54.360 --> 32:55.560\n I don't know if we mentioned,\n\n32:55.560 --> 32:56.960\n is there something interesting\n\n32:56.960 --> 33:00.200\n about the various superconducting materials involved\n\n33:00.200 --> 33:01.040\n or is it all?\n\n33:01.040 --> 33:02.640\n There's a lot of stuff that's interesting.\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:04.440\n And it's not silicon.\n\n33:04.440 --> 33:05.840\n It's not silicon, no.\n\n33:05.840 --> 33:09.520\n So like it's some materials that also required\n\n33:09.520 --> 33:12.560\n to be super cold, four Kelvin and so on.\n\n33:12.560 --> 33:15.280\n So let's dissect a couple of those different things.\n\n33:15.280 --> 33:16.280\n The super cold part,\n\n33:16.280 --> 33:19.640\n let me just mention for your gamers out there\n\n33:19.640 --> 33:21.320\n that are trying to clock it at four gigahertz\n\n33:21.320 --> 33:22.160\n and would love to go to 400.\n\n33:22.160 --> 33:24.120\n What kind of cooling system can achieve four Kelvin?\n\n33:24.120 --> 33:26.280\n Four Kelvin, you need liquid helium.\n\n33:26.280 --> 33:29.040\n And so liquid helium is expensive.\n\n33:29.040 --> 33:29.880\n It's inconvenient.\n\n33:29.880 --> 33:32.080\n You need a cryostat that sits there\n\n33:32.080 --> 33:36.520\n and the energy consumption of that cryostat\n\n33:36.520 --> 33:40.080\n is impracticable for, it's not going in your cell phone.\n\n33:40.080 --> 33:42.080\n So you can picture holding your cell phone like this\n\n33:42.080 --> 33:46.600\n and then something the size of a keg of beer or something\n\n33:46.600 --> 33:47.800\n on your back to cool it.\n\n33:47.800 --> 33:49.520\n Like that makes no sense.\n\n33:49.520 --> 33:54.120\n So if you're trying to make this in consumer devices,\n\n33:54.120 --> 33:57.000\n electronics that are ubiquitous across society,\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:59.280\n superconductors are not in the race for that.\n\n33:59.280 --> 34:01.000\n For now, but you're saying,\n\n34:01.000 --> 34:03.240\n so just to frame the conversation,\n\n34:03.240 --> 34:05.520\n maybe the thing we're focused on\n\n34:05.520 --> 34:10.360\n is computing systems that serve as servers, like large.\n\n34:10.360 --> 34:11.800\n Yes, large systems.\n\n34:11.800 --> 34:14.800\n So then you can contrast what's going on in your cell phone\n\n34:14.800 --> 34:18.240\n with what's going on at one of the supercomputers.\n\n34:19.400 --> 34:22.080\n Colleague Katie Schuman invited us out to Oak Ridge\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:24.080\n a few years ago, so we got to see Titan\n\n34:24.080 --> 34:26.120\n and that was when they were building Summit.\n\n34:26.120 --> 34:29.240\n So these are some high performance supercomputers\n\n34:29.240 --> 34:32.480\n out in Tennessee and those are filling entire rooms\n\n34:32.480 --> 34:33.920\n the size of warehouses.\n\n34:33.920 --> 34:36.280\n So once you're at that level, okay,\n\n34:36.280 --> 34:39.080\n there you're already putting a lot of power into cooling.\n\n34:39.080 --> 34:42.240\n Cooling is part of your engineering task\n\n34:42.240 --> 34:43.600\n that you have to deal with.\n\n34:43.600 --> 34:45.600\n So there it's not entirely obvious\n\n34:45.600 --> 34:49.520\n that cooling to four Kelvin is out of the question.\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:53.240\n It has not happened yet and I can speak to why that is\n\n34:53.240 --> 34:55.520\n in the digital domain if you're interested.\n\n34:55.520 --> 34:57.520\n I think it's not going to happen.\n\n34:57.520 --> 35:01.240\n I don't think superconductors are gonna replace\n\n35:01.240 --> 35:04.680\n semiconductors for digital computation.\n\n35:05.880 --> 35:07.640\n There are a lot of reasons for that,\n\n35:07.640 --> 35:09.800\n but I think ultimately what it comes down to\n\n35:09.800 --> 35:13.440\n is all things considered cooling errors,\n\n35:13.440 --> 35:16.080\n scaling down to feature sizes, all that stuff,\n\n35:16.080 --> 35:19.400\n semiconductors work better at the system level.\n\n35:19.400 --> 35:22.720\n Is there some aspect of just curious\n\n35:22.720 --> 35:25.560\n about the historical momentum of this?\n\n35:25.560 --> 35:28.200\n Is there some power to the momentum of an industry\n\n35:28.200 --> 35:31.200\n that's mass manufacturing using a certain material?\n\n35:31.200 --> 35:33.680\n Is this like a Titanic shifting?\n\n35:33.680 --> 35:37.120\n Like what's your sense when a good idea comes along,\n\n35:37.120 --> 35:39.920\n how good does that idea need to be\n\n35:39.920 --> 35:42.640\n for the Titanic to start shifting?\n\n35:42.640 --> 35:44.200\n That's an excellent question.\n\n35:44.200 --> 35:46.520\n That's an excellent way to frame it.\n\n35:46.520 --> 35:51.320\n And you know, I don't know the answer to that,\n\n35:51.320 --> 35:53.600\n but what I think is, okay,\n\n35:53.600 --> 35:56.400\n so the history of the superconducting logic\n\n35:56.400 --> 35:58.000\n goes back to the 70s.\n\n35:58.000 --> 35:59.760\n IBM made a big push to do\n\n35:59.760 --> 36:02.400\n superconducting digital computing in the 70s.\n\n36:02.400 --> 36:06.080\n And they made some choices about their devices\n\n36:06.080 --> 36:09.440\n and their architectures and things that in hindsight,\n\n36:09.440 --> 36:11.000\n were kind of doomed to fail.\n\n36:11.000 --> 36:13.120\n And I don't mean any disrespect for the people that did it,\n\n36:13.120 --> 36:14.280\n it was hard to see at the time.\n\n36:14.280 --> 36:17.880\n But then another generation of superconducting logic\n\n36:17.880 --> 36:22.320\n was introduced, I wanna say the 90s,\n\n36:22.320 --> 36:25.000\n someone named Lykarev and Seminov,\n\n36:25.000 --> 36:28.280\n they proposed an entire family of circuits\n\n36:28.280 --> 36:29.920\n based on Joseph's injunctions\n\n36:29.920 --> 36:33.440\n that are doing digital computing based on logic gates\n\n36:33.440 --> 36:36.600\n and or not these kinds of things.\n\n36:37.920 --> 36:41.560\n And they showed how it could go hundreds of times faster\n\n36:41.560 --> 36:43.200\n than silicon microelectronics.\n\n36:43.200 --> 36:45.360\n And it's extremely exciting.\n\n36:45.360 --> 36:47.040\n I wasn't working in the field at that time,\n\n36:47.040 --> 36:49.560\n but later when I went back and read the literature,\n\n36:49.560 --> 36:52.040\n I was just like, wow, this is so awesome.\n\n36:53.040 --> 36:56.000\n And so you might think, well,\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:58.280\n the reason why it didn't display silicon\n\n36:58.280 --> 37:00.400\n is because silicon already had so much momentum\n\n37:00.400 --> 37:01.720\n at that time.\n\n37:01.720 --> 37:02.960\n But that was the 90s.\n\n37:02.960 --> 37:04.320\n Silicon kept that momentum\n\n37:04.320 --> 37:06.960\n because it had the simple way to keep getting better.\n\n37:06.960 --> 37:08.720\n You just make features smaller and smaller.\n\n37:08.720 --> 37:11.800\n So it would have to be,\n\n37:11.800 --> 37:13.560\n I don't think it would have to be that much better\n\n37:13.560 --> 37:15.440\n than silicon to displace it.\n\n37:15.440 --> 37:17.800\n But the problem is it's just not better than silicon.\n\n37:17.800 --> 37:19.960\n It might be better than silicon in one metric,\n\n37:19.960 --> 37:21.440\n speed of a switching operation\n\n37:21.440 --> 37:24.400\n or power consumption of a switching operation.\n\n37:24.400 --> 37:26.680\n But building a digital computer is a lot more\n\n37:26.680 --> 37:28.720\n than just that elemental operation.\n\n37:28.720 --> 37:31.040\n It's everything that goes into it,\n\n37:31.040 --> 37:33.320\n including the manufacturing, including the packaging,\n\n37:33.320 --> 37:38.320\n including the various materials aspects of things.\n\n37:38.840 --> 37:40.600\n So the reason why,\n\n37:40.600 --> 37:42.800\n and even in some of those early papers,\n\n37:42.800 --> 37:44.120\n I can't remember which one it was,\n\n37:44.120 --> 37:47.480\n Lykarev said something along the lines of,\n\n37:47.480 --> 37:49.920\n you can see how we could build an entire family\n\n37:49.920 --> 37:52.800\n of digital electronic circuits based on these components.\n\n37:52.800 --> 37:55.000\n They could go a hundred or more times faster\n\n37:55.000 --> 37:59.320\n than semiconductor logic gates.\n\n37:59.320 --> 38:00.920\n But I don't think that's the right way\n\n38:00.920 --> 38:02.680\n to use superconducting electronic circuits.\n\n38:02.680 --> 38:04.320\n He didn't say what the right way was,\n\n38:04.320 --> 38:07.480\n but he basically said digital logic,\n\n38:07.480 --> 38:11.280\n trying to steal the show from silicon\n\n38:11.280 --> 38:13.440\n is probably not what these circuits\n\n38:13.440 --> 38:16.360\n are most suited to accomplish.\n\n38:16.360 --> 38:20.840\n So if we can just linger and use the word computation.\n\n38:20.840 --> 38:24.080\n When you talk about computation, how do you think about it?\n\n38:24.080 --> 38:28.920\n Do you think purely on just the switching,\n\n38:28.920 --> 38:31.320\n or do you think something a little bit larger scale,\n\n38:31.320 --> 38:32.720\n a circuit taken together,\n\n38:32.720 --> 38:36.940\n performing the basic arithmetic operations\n\n38:36.940 --> 38:40.400\n that are then required to do the kind of computation\n\n38:40.400 --> 38:42.160\n that makes up a computer?\n\n38:42.160 --> 38:44.400\n Because when we talk about the speed of computation,\n\n38:44.400 --> 38:46.960\n is it boiled down to the basic switching,\n\n38:46.960 --> 38:48.400\n or is there some bigger picture\n\n38:48.400 --> 38:49.240\n that you're thinking about?\n\n38:49.240 --> 38:52.240\n Well, all right, so maybe we should disambiguate.\n\n38:52.240 --> 38:55.600\n There are a variety of different kinds of computation.\n\n38:55.600 --> 38:57.200\n I don't pretend to be an expert\n\n38:57.200 --> 39:00.180\n in the theory of computation or anything like that.\n\n39:00.180 --> 39:02.640\n I guess it's important to differentiate though\n\n39:02.640 --> 39:05.800\n between digital logic,\n\n39:05.800 --> 39:09.800\n which represents information as a series of bits,\n\n39:09.800 --> 39:13.000\n binary digits, which you can think of them\n\n39:13.000 --> 39:14.160\n as zeros and ones or whatever.\n\n39:14.160 --> 39:17.400\n Usually they correspond to a physical system\n\n39:17.400 --> 39:21.240\n that has two very well separated states.\n\n39:21.240 --> 39:22.860\n And then other kinds of computation,\n\n39:22.860 --> 39:25.280\n like we'll get into more the way your brain works,\n\n39:25.280 --> 39:27.600\n which it is, I think,\n\n39:27.600 --> 39:30.400\n indisputably processing information,\n\n39:30.400 --> 39:34.080\n but where the computation begins and ends\n\n39:34.080 --> 39:36.360\n is not anywhere near as well defined.\n\n39:36.360 --> 39:39.680\n It doesn't depend on these two levels.\n\n39:39.680 --> 39:41.320\n Here's a zero, here's a one.\n\n39:41.320 --> 39:42.640\n There's a lot of gray area\n\n39:42.640 --> 39:45.640\n that's usually referred to as analog computing.\n\n39:45.640 --> 39:49.860\n Also in conventional digital computers\n\n39:49.860 --> 39:54.240\n or digital computers in general,\n\n39:54.240 --> 39:57.300\n you have a concept of what's called arithmetic depth,\n\n39:57.300 --> 39:59.820\n which is jargon that basically means\n\n39:59.820 --> 40:03.860\n how many sequential operations are performed\n\n40:03.860 --> 40:07.680\n to turn an input into an output.\n\n40:07.680 --> 40:10.900\n And those kinds of computations in digital systems\n\n40:10.900 --> 40:14.500\n are highly serial, meaning that data streams,\n\n40:14.500 --> 40:16.500\n they don't branch off too far to the side.\n\n40:16.500 --> 40:18.900\n You do, you have to pull some information over there\n\n40:18.900 --> 40:20.900\n and access memory from here and stuff like that.\n\n40:20.900 --> 40:24.340\n But by and large, the computation proceeds\n\n40:24.340 --> 40:26.220\n in a serial manner.\n\n40:26.220 --> 40:27.740\n It's not that way in the brain.\n\n40:27.740 --> 40:30.740\n In the brain, you're always drawing information\n\n40:30.740 --> 40:31.580\n from different places.\n\n40:31.580 --> 40:33.820\n It's much more network based computing.\n\n40:33.820 --> 40:35.680\n Neurons don't wait for their turn.\n\n40:35.680 --> 40:37.180\n They fire when they're ready to fire.\n\n40:37.180 --> 40:39.220\n And so it's asynchronous.\n\n40:39.220 --> 40:41.680\n So one of the other things about a digital system\n\n40:41.680 --> 40:44.500\n is you're performing these operations on a clock.\n\n40:44.500 --> 40:46.700\n And that's a crucial aspect of it.\n\n40:46.700 --> 40:48.900\n Get rid of a clock in a digital system,\n\n40:48.900 --> 40:50.460\n nothing makes sense anymore.\n\n40:50.460 --> 40:51.580\n The brain has no clock.\n\n40:51.580 --> 40:55.340\n It builds its own timescales based on its internal activity.\n\n40:56.580 --> 40:59.500\n So you can think of the brain as kind of like this,\n\n40:59.500 --> 41:00.940\n like network computation,\n\n41:00.940 --> 41:04.600\n where it's actually really trivial, simple computers,\n\n41:05.700 --> 41:08.980\n just a huge number of them and they're networked.\n\n41:08.980 --> 41:12.940\n I would say it is complex, sophisticated little processors\n\n41:12.940 --> 41:14.420\n and there's a huge number of them.\n\n41:14.420 --> 41:16.180\n Neurons are not, are not simple.\n\n41:16.180 --> 41:17.620\n I don't mean to offend neurons.\n\n41:17.620 --> 41:19.780\n They're very complicated and beautiful and yeah,\n\n41:19.780 --> 41:21.980\n but we often oversimplify them.\n\n41:21.980 --> 41:24.820\n Yes, they're actually like there's computation happening\n\n41:24.820 --> 41:25.660\n within a neuron.\n\n41:25.660 --> 41:29.520\n Right, so I would say to think of a transistor\n\n41:29.520 --> 41:32.340\n as the building block of a digital computer is accurate.\n\n41:32.340 --> 41:34.660\n You use a few transistors to make your logic gates.\n\n41:34.660 --> 41:37.060\n You build up more, you build up processors\n\n41:37.060 --> 41:39.140\n from logic gates and things like that.\n\n41:39.140 --> 41:40.600\n So you can think of a transistor\n\n41:40.600 --> 41:42.300\n as a fundamental building block,\n\n41:42.300 --> 41:43.380\n or you can think of,\n\n41:43.380 --> 41:46.360\n as we get into more highly parallelized architectures,\n\n41:46.360 --> 41:47.700\n you can think of a processor\n\n41:47.700 --> 41:49.300\n as a fundamental building block.\n\n41:49.300 --> 41:53.180\n To make the analogy to the neuro side of things,\n\n41:53.180 --> 41:55.320\n a neuron is not a transistor.\n\n41:55.320 --> 41:57.300\n A neuron is a processor.\n\n41:57.300 --> 42:00.220\n It has synapses, even synapses are not transistors,\n\n42:00.220 --> 42:01.340\n but they are more,\n\n42:02.180 --> 42:04.820\n they're lower on the information processing hierarchy\n\n42:04.820 --> 42:05.660\n in a sense.\n\n42:05.660 --> 42:08.180\n They do a bulk of the computation,\n\n42:08.180 --> 42:13.180\n but neurons are entire processors in and of themselves\n\n42:13.580 --> 42:16.300\n that can take in many different kinds of inputs\n\n42:16.300 --> 42:18.780\n on many different spatial and temporal scales\n\n42:18.780 --> 42:20.820\n and produce many different kinds of outputs\n\n42:20.820 --> 42:23.820\n so that they can perform different computations\n\n42:23.820 --> 42:24.860\n in different contexts.\n\n42:24.860 --> 42:27.440\n So this is where enters this distinction\n\n42:27.440 --> 42:30.740\n between computation and communication.\n\n42:30.740 --> 42:34.140\n So you can think of neurons performing computation\n\n42:34.140 --> 42:36.580\n and the inter, the networking,\n\n42:36.580 --> 42:39.000\n the interconnectivity of neurons\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:40.940\n is communication between neurons.\n\n42:40.940 --> 42:43.500\n And you see this with very large server systems.\n\n42:43.500 --> 42:45.020\n I've been, I mentioned offline,\n\n42:45.020 --> 42:46.180\n we've been talking to Jim Keller,\n\n42:46.180 --> 42:48.140\n whose dream is to build giant computers\n\n42:48.140 --> 42:51.220\n that, you know, the bottom like there\n\n42:51.220 --> 42:52.380\n is often the communication\n\n42:52.380 --> 42:54.700\n between the different pieces of computing.\n\n42:54.700 --> 42:57.380\n So in this paper that we mentioned,\n\n42:57.380 --> 42:59.660\n Optoelectronic Intelligence,\n\n42:59.660 --> 43:03.220\n you say electrons excel at computation\n\n43:03.220 --> 43:08.220\n while light is excellent for communication.\n\n43:08.380 --> 43:11.060\n Maybe you can linger and say in this context,\n\n43:11.060 --> 43:13.980\n what do you mean by computation and communication?\n\n43:13.980 --> 43:17.420\n What are electrons, what is light\n\n43:17.420 --> 43:20.660\n and why do they excel at those two tasks?\n\n43:20.660 --> 43:23.620\n Yeah, just to first speak to computation\n\n43:23.620 --> 43:25.620\n versus communication,\n\n43:25.620 --> 43:30.340\n I would say computation is essentially taking in\n\n43:30.340 --> 43:33.860\n some information, performing operations\n\n43:33.860 --> 43:37.220\n on that information and producing new,\n\n43:37.220 --> 43:39.060\n hopefully more useful information.\n\n43:39.060 --> 43:44.060\n So for example, imagine you have a picture in front of you\n\n43:45.020 --> 43:48.020\n and there is a key in it\n\n43:48.020 --> 43:48.940\n and that's what you're looking for,\n\n43:48.940 --> 43:50.700\n for whatever reason, you wanna find the key,\n\n43:50.700 --> 43:51.580\n we all wanna find the key.\n\n43:51.580 --> 43:56.540\n So the input is that entire picture\n\n43:56.540 --> 43:59.060\n and the output might be the coordinates where the key is.\n\n43:59.060 --> 44:01.540\n So you've reduced the total amount of information you have\n\n44:01.540 --> 44:03.020\n but you found the useful information\n\n44:03.020 --> 44:04.380\n for you in that present moment,\n\n44:04.380 --> 44:05.220\n that's the useful information.\n\n44:05.220 --> 44:07.180\n And you think about this computation\n\n44:07.180 --> 44:10.820\n as the controlled synchronous sequential?\n\n44:10.820 --> 44:12.700\n Not necessarily, it could be,\n\n44:12.700 --> 44:16.220\n that could be how your system is performing the computation\n\n44:16.220 --> 44:19.300\n or it could be asynchronous,\n\n44:19.300 --> 44:21.420\n there are lots of ways to find the key.\n\n44:21.420 --> 44:23.700\n It depends on the nature of the data,\n\n44:23.700 --> 44:27.540\n it depends on, that's a very simplified example,\n\n44:27.540 --> 44:28.700\n a picture with a key in it,\n\n44:28.700 --> 44:30.540\n what about if you're in the world\n\n44:30.540 --> 44:32.500\n and you're trying to decide the best way\n\n44:32.500 --> 44:34.900\n to live your life?\n\n44:35.940 --> 44:37.020\n It might be interactive,\n\n44:37.020 --> 44:38.580\n it might be there might be some recurrence\n\n44:38.580 --> 44:41.340\n or some weird asynchrony, I got it.\n\n44:41.340 --> 44:43.260\n But there's an input and there's an output\n\n44:43.260 --> 44:44.460\n and you do some stuff in the middle\n\n44:44.460 --> 44:46.020\n that actually goes from the input to the output.\n\n44:46.020 --> 44:47.340\n You've taken in information\n\n44:47.340 --> 44:49.100\n and output different information,\n\n44:49.100 --> 44:51.820\n hopefully reducing the total amount of information\n\n44:51.820 --> 44:53.820\n and extracting what's useful.\n\n44:53.820 --> 44:57.780\n Communication is then getting that information\n\n44:57.780 --> 44:59.460\n from the location at which it's stored\n\n44:59.460 --> 45:02.660\n because information is physical as Landauer emphasized\n\n45:02.660 --> 45:04.940\n and so it is in one place\n\n45:04.940 --> 45:07.860\n and you need to get that information to another place\n\n45:07.860 --> 45:10.100\n so that something else can use it\n\n45:10.100 --> 45:12.020\n for whatever computation it's working on.\n\n45:12.020 --> 45:13.460\n Maybe it's part of the same network\n\n45:13.460 --> 45:15.020\n and you're all trying to solve the same problem\n\n45:15.020 --> 45:20.020\n but neuron A over here just deduced something\n\n45:20.500 --> 45:21.620\n based on its inputs\n\n45:21.620 --> 45:25.180\n and it's now sending that information across the network\n\n45:25.180 --> 45:26.460\n to another location\n\n45:26.460 --> 45:28.420\n so that would be the act of communication.\n\n45:28.420 --> 45:29.900\n Can you linger on Landauer\n\n45:29.900 --> 45:31.820\n and saying information is physical?\n\n45:31.820 --> 45:35.340\n Rolf Landauer, not to be confused with Lev Landauer.\n\n45:35.340 --> 45:38.020\n Yeah, and he made huge contributions\n\n45:38.020 --> 45:42.980\n to our understanding of the reversibility of information\n\n45:42.980 --> 45:46.700\n and this concept that energy has to be dissipated\n\n45:46.700 --> 45:50.100\n in computing when the computation is irreversible\n\n45:50.100 --> 45:52.140\n but if you can manage to make it reversible\n\n45:52.140 --> 45:55.060\n then you don't need to expend energy\n\n45:55.060 --> 45:59.660\n but if you do expend energy to perform a computation\n\n45:59.660 --> 46:02.300\n there's sort of a minimal amount that you have to do\n\n46:02.300 --> 46:04.460\n and it's KT log two.\n\n46:04.460 --> 46:05.900\n And it's all somehow related\n\n46:05.900 --> 46:07.660\n to the second law of thermodynamics\n\n46:07.660 --> 46:09.620\n and that the universe is an information process\n\n46:09.620 --> 46:11.500\n and then we're living in a simulation.\n\n46:11.500 --> 46:13.980\n So okay, sorry, sorry for that tangent.\n\n46:13.980 --> 46:17.140\n So that's the defining the distinction\n\n46:17.140 --> 46:19.580\n between computation and communication.\n\n46:19.580 --> 46:21.940\n Let me say one more thing just to clarify.\n\n46:21.940 --> 46:26.940\n Communication ideally does not change the information.\n\n46:27.100 --> 46:28.900\n It moves it from one place to another\n\n46:28.900 --> 46:30.940\n but it is preserved.\n\n46:30.940 --> 46:32.500\n Got it, okay.\n\n46:32.500 --> 46:33.700\n All right, that's beautiful.\n\n46:33.700 --> 46:38.620\n So then the electron versus light distinction\n\n46:38.620 --> 46:42.380\n and why are electrons good at computation\n\n46:42.380 --> 46:44.540\n and light good at communication?\n\n46:44.540 --> 46:48.820\n Yes, there's a lot that goes into it I guess\n\n46:48.820 --> 46:52.100\n but just try to speak to the simplest part of it.\n\n46:54.100 --> 46:56.980\n Electrons interact strongly with one another.\n\n46:56.980 --> 46:58.340\n They're charged particles.\n\n46:58.340 --> 47:02.020\n So if I pile a bunch of them over here\n\n47:02.020 --> 47:03.860\n they're feeling a certain amount of force\n\n47:03.860 --> 47:05.700\n and they wanna move somewhere else.\n\n47:05.700 --> 47:06.900\n They're strongly interactive.\n\n47:06.900 --> 47:08.900\n You can also get them to sit still.\n\n47:08.900 --> 47:10.660\n You can, an electron has a mass\n\n47:10.660 --> 47:15.660\n so you can cause it to be spatially localized.\n\n47:15.860 --> 47:18.100\n So for computation that's useful\n\n47:18.100 --> 47:20.140\n because now I can make these little devices\n\n47:20.140 --> 47:21.940\n that put a bunch of electrons over here\n\n47:21.940 --> 47:25.620\n and then I change the state of a gate\n\n47:25.620 --> 47:26.500\n like I've been describing,\n\n47:26.500 --> 47:28.380\n put a different voltage on this gate\n\n47:28.380 --> 47:29.980\n and now I move the electrons over here.\n\n47:29.980 --> 47:31.220\n Now they're sitting somewhere else.\n\n47:31.220 --> 47:33.980\n I have a physical mechanism\n\n47:33.980 --> 47:36.020\n with which I can represent information.\n\n47:36.020 --> 47:38.140\n It's spatially localized and I have knobs\n\n47:38.140 --> 47:41.220\n that I can adjust to change where those electrons are\n\n47:41.220 --> 47:42.380\n or what they're doing.\n\n47:42.380 --> 47:45.220\n Light by contrast, photons of light\n\n47:45.220 --> 47:48.100\n which are the discrete packets of energy\n\n47:48.100 --> 47:50.740\n that were identified by Einstein,\n\n47:50.740 --> 47:53.420\n they do not interact with each other\n\n47:54.540 --> 47:56.260\n especially at low light levels.\n\n47:56.260 --> 48:00.380\n If you're in a medium and you have a bright high light level\n\n48:00.380 --> 48:02.540\n you can get them to interact with each other\n\n48:02.540 --> 48:05.340\n through the interaction with that medium that they're in\n\n48:05.340 --> 48:07.780\n but that's a little bit more exotic.\n\n48:07.780 --> 48:10.340\n And for the purposes of this conversation\n\n48:10.340 --> 48:13.180\n we can assume that photons don't interact with each other.\n\n48:13.180 --> 48:16.100\n So if you have a bunch of them\n\n48:16.100 --> 48:17.580\n all propagating in the same direction\n\n48:17.580 --> 48:19.140\n they don't interfere with each other.\n\n48:19.140 --> 48:22.900\n If I wanna send, if I have a communication channel\n\n48:22.900 --> 48:24.460\n and I put one more photon on it,\n\n48:24.460 --> 48:26.020\n it doesn't screw up with those other ones.\n\n48:26.020 --> 48:29.060\n It doesn't change what those other ones were doing at all.\n\n48:29.060 --> 48:31.260\n So that's really useful for communication\n\n48:31.260 --> 48:33.660\n because that means you can sort of allow\n\n48:33.660 --> 48:35.580\n a lot of these photons to flow\n\n48:37.060 --> 48:38.820\n without disruption of each other\n\n48:38.820 --> 48:41.060\n and they can branch really easily and things like that.\n\n48:41.060 --> 48:42.700\n But it's not good for computation\n\n48:42.700 --> 48:46.340\n because it's very hard for this packet of light\n\n48:46.340 --> 48:48.700\n to change what this packet of light is doing.\n\n48:48.700 --> 48:50.180\n They pass right through each other.\n\n48:50.180 --> 48:53.260\n So in computation you want to change information\n\n48:53.260 --> 48:55.700\n and if photons don't interact with each other\n\n48:55.700 --> 48:58.020\n it's difficult to get them to change the information\n\n48:58.020 --> 48:59.380\n represented by the others.\n\n48:59.380 --> 49:01.580\n So that's the fundamental difference.\n\n49:01.580 --> 49:04.780\n Is there also something about the way they travel\n\n49:04.780 --> 49:06.420\n through different materials\n\n49:07.460 --> 49:10.700\n or is that just a particular engineering?\n\n49:10.700 --> 49:12.580\n No, it's not, that's deep physics I think.\n\n49:12.580 --> 49:17.060\n So this gets back to electrons interact with each other\n\n49:17.060 --> 49:18.140\n and photons don't.\n\n49:18.140 --> 49:22.380\n So say I'm trying to get a packet of information\n\n49:22.380 --> 49:25.820\n from me to you and we have a wire going between us.\n\n49:25.820 --> 49:29.020\n In order for me to send electrons across that wire\n\n49:29.020 --> 49:32.180\n I first have to raise the voltage on my end of the wire\n\n49:32.180 --> 49:34.580\n and that means putting a bunch of charges on it\n\n49:34.580 --> 49:39.140\n and then that charge packet has to propagate along the wire\n\n49:39.140 --> 49:41.260\n and it has to get all the way over to you.\n\n49:41.260 --> 49:44.380\n That wire is gonna have something that's called capacitance\n\n49:44.380 --> 49:46.940\n which basically tells you how much charge\n\n49:46.940 --> 49:48.060\n you need to put on the wire\n\n49:48.060 --> 49:49.980\n in order to raise the voltage on it\n\n49:49.980 --> 49:52.500\n and the capacitance is gonna be proportional\n\n49:52.500 --> 49:54.060\n to the length of the wire.\n\n49:54.060 --> 49:56.900\n So the longer the length of the wire is\n\n49:56.900 --> 49:59.140\n the more charge I have to put on it\n\n49:59.140 --> 50:03.060\n and the energy required to charge up that line\n\n50:03.060 --> 50:04.980\n and move those electrons to you\n\n50:04.980 --> 50:06.860\n is also proportional to the capacitance\n\n50:06.860 --> 50:08.500\n and goes as the voltage squared.\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:13.500\n So you get this huge penalty if you wanna send electrons\n\n50:13.780 --> 50:16.620\n across a wire over appreciable distances.\n\n50:16.620 --> 50:19.140\n So distance is an important thing here\n\n50:19.140 --> 50:20.780\n when you're doing communication.\n\n50:20.780 --> 50:22.140\n Distance is an important thing.\n\n50:22.140 --> 50:25.340\n So is the number of connections I'm trying to make.\n\n50:25.340 --> 50:27.620\n Me to you, okay one, that's not so bad.\n\n50:27.620 --> 50:31.420\n If I want to now send it to 10,000 other friends\n\n50:31.420 --> 50:34.380\n then all of those wires are adding tons\n\n50:34.380 --> 50:35.460\n of extra capacitance.\n\n50:35.460 --> 50:37.660\n Now not only does it take forever\n\n50:37.660 --> 50:39.540\n to put the charge on that wire\n\n50:39.540 --> 50:41.820\n and raise the voltage on all those lines\n\n50:41.820 --> 50:43.540\n but it takes a ton of power\n\n50:43.540 --> 50:46.980\n and the number 10,000 is not randomly chosen.\n\n50:46.980 --> 50:49.100\n That's roughly how many connections\n\n50:49.100 --> 50:50.620\n each neuron in your brain makes.\n\n50:50.620 --> 50:55.020\n So a neuron in your brain needs to send 10,000 messages\n\n50:55.020 --> 50:56.780\n every time it has something to say.\n\n50:56.780 --> 51:00.100\n You can't do that if you're trying to drive electrons\n\n51:00.100 --> 51:02.060\n from here to 10,000 different places.\n\n51:02.060 --> 51:03.660\n The brain does it in a slightly different way\n\n51:03.660 --> 51:04.860\n which we can discuss.\n\n51:04.860 --> 51:07.020\n How can light achieve the 10,000 connections\n\n51:07.020 --> 51:09.340\n and why is it better?\n\n51:09.340 --> 51:12.580\n In terms of like the energy use required\n\n51:12.580 --> 51:15.260\n to use light for the communication of the 10,000 connections.\n\n51:15.260 --> 51:16.100\n Right, right.\n\n51:16.100 --> 51:17.700\n So now instead of trying to send electrons\n\n51:17.700 --> 51:19.380\n from me to you, I'm trying to send photons.\n\n51:19.380 --> 51:21.540\n So I can make what's called a wave guide\n\n51:21.540 --> 51:25.140\n which is just a simple piece of a material.\n\n51:25.140 --> 51:27.060\n It could be glass like an optical fiber\n\n51:27.060 --> 51:29.860\n or silicon on a chip.\n\n51:29.860 --> 51:34.140\n And I just have to inject photons into that wave guide\n\n51:34.140 --> 51:35.800\n and independent of how long it is,\n\n51:35.800 --> 51:39.620\n independent of how many different connections I'm making,\n\n51:39.620 --> 51:43.140\n it doesn't change the voltage or anything like that\n\n51:43.140 --> 51:45.460\n that I have to raise up on the wire.\n\n51:45.460 --> 51:47.940\n So if I have one more connection,\n\n51:47.940 --> 51:49.820\n if I add additional connections,\n\n51:49.820 --> 51:51.760\n I need to add more light to the wave guide\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:53.280\n because those photons need to split\n\n51:53.280 --> 51:55.040\n and go to different paths.\n\n51:55.040 --> 51:58.860\n That makes sense but I don't have a capacitive penalty.\n\n51:58.860 --> 52:01.300\n Sometimes these are called wiring parasitics.\n\n52:01.300 --> 52:03.460\n There are no parasitics associated with light\n\n52:03.460 --> 52:04.420\n in that same sense.\n\n52:04.420 --> 52:07.500\n So this might be a dumb question\n\n52:07.500 --> 52:11.380\n but how do I catch a photon on the other end?\n\n52:11.380 --> 52:12.500\n Is it material?\n\n52:12.500 --> 52:15.020\n Is it the polymer stuff you were talking about\n\n52:15.020 --> 52:19.380\n for a different application for photolithography?\n\n52:19.380 --> 52:20.980\n Like how do you catch a photon?\n\n52:20.980 --> 52:22.500\n There's a lot of ways to catch a photon.\n\n52:22.500 --> 52:23.620\n It's not a dumb question.\n\n52:23.620 --> 52:25.940\n It's a deep and important question\n\n52:25.940 --> 52:29.180\n that basically defines a lot of the work\n\n52:29.180 --> 52:31.380\n that goes on in our group at NIST.\n\n52:31.380 --> 52:34.260\n One of my group leaders, Seywoon Nam,\n\n52:34.260 --> 52:35.780\n has built his career around\n\n52:35.780 --> 52:38.420\n these superconducting single photon detectors.\n\n52:38.420 --> 52:42.460\n So if you're going to try to sort of reach a lower limit\n\n52:42.460 --> 52:45.260\n and detect just one particle of light,\n\n52:45.260 --> 52:47.660\n superconductors come back into our conversation\n\n52:47.660 --> 52:50.140\n and just picture a simple device\n\n52:50.140 --> 52:51.600\n where you have current flowing\n\n52:51.600 --> 52:54.580\n through a superconducting wire and...\n\n52:54.580 --> 52:56.560\n A loop again or no?\n\n52:56.560 --> 52:57.820\n Let's say yes, you have a loop.\n\n52:57.820 --> 52:59.580\n So you have a superconducting wire\n\n52:59.580 --> 53:01.000\n that goes straight down like this\n\n53:01.000 --> 53:04.260\n and on your loop branch, you have a little ammeter,\n\n53:04.260 --> 53:05.800\n something that measures current.\n\n53:05.800 --> 53:07.980\n There's a resistor up there too.\n\n53:07.980 --> 53:09.020\n Go with me here.\n\n53:09.020 --> 53:12.020\n So your current biasing this,\n\n53:12.020 --> 53:13.060\n so there's current flowing\n\n53:13.060 --> 53:14.400\n through that superconducting branch.\n\n53:14.400 --> 53:16.560\n Since there's a resistor over here,\n\n53:16.560 --> 53:18.940\n all the current goes through the superconducting branch.\n\n53:18.940 --> 53:22.280\n Now a photon comes in, strikes that superconductor.\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:24.300\n We talked about this superconducting\n\n53:24.300 --> 53:25.760\n macroscopic quantum state.\n\n53:25.760 --> 53:28.480\n That's going to be destroyed by the energy of that photon.\n\n53:28.480 --> 53:32.080\n So now that branch of the circuit is resistive too.\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:33.780\n And you've properly designed your circuit\n\n53:33.780 --> 53:36.700\n so that the resistance on that superconducting branch\n\n53:36.700 --> 53:38.420\n is much greater than the other resistance.\n\n53:38.420 --> 53:40.780\n Now all of your current's going to go that way.\n\n53:40.780 --> 53:43.260\n Your ammeter says, oh, I just got a pulse of current.\n\n53:43.260 --> 53:45.140\n That must mean I detected a photon.\n\n53:45.140 --> 53:47.220\n Then where you broke that superconductivity\n\n53:47.220 --> 53:49.100\n in a matter of a few nanoseconds,\n\n53:49.100 --> 53:51.100\n it cools back off, dissipates that energy\n\n53:51.100 --> 53:52.820\n and the current flows back\n\n53:52.820 --> 53:54.300\n through that superconducting branch.\n\n53:54.300 --> 53:59.260\n This is a very powerful superconducting device\n\n53:59.260 --> 54:02.300\n that allows us to understand quantum states of light.\n\n54:02.300 --> 54:04.880\n I didn't realize a loop like that\n\n54:04.880 --> 54:07.160\n could be sensitive to a single photon.\n\n54:07.160 --> 54:12.000\n I mean, that seems strange to me because,\n\n54:13.060 --> 54:15.700\n I mean, so what happens when you just barrage it\n\n54:15.700 --> 54:16.620\n with photons?\n\n54:16.620 --> 54:18.340\n If you put a bunch of photons in there,\n\n54:18.340 --> 54:19.860\n essentially the same thing happens.\n\n54:19.860 --> 54:21.660\n You just drive it into the normal state,\n\n54:21.660 --> 54:25.420\n it becomes resistive and it's not particularly interesting.\n\n54:25.420 --> 54:27.980\n So you have to be careful how many photons you send.\n\n54:27.980 --> 54:30.100\n Like you have to be very precise with your communication.\n\n54:30.100 --> 54:31.220\n Well, it depends.\n\n54:31.220 --> 54:34.220\n So I would say that that's actually in the application\n\n54:34.220 --> 54:37.060\n that we're trying to use these detectors for.\n\n54:37.060 --> 54:39.900\n That's a feature because what we want is for,\n\n54:41.140 --> 54:46.140\n if a neuron sends one photon to a synaptic connection\n\n54:46.660 --> 54:49.860\n and one of these superconducting detectors is sitting there,\n\n54:49.860 --> 54:51.200\n you get this pulse of current.\n\n54:51.200 --> 54:54.000\n And that synapse says event,\n\n54:54.000 --> 54:56.020\n then I'm gonna do what I do when there's a synapse event,\n\n54:56.020 --> 54:58.660\n I'm gonna perform computations, that kind of thing.\n\n54:58.660 --> 55:02.100\n But if accidentally you send two there or three or five,\n\n55:02.100 --> 55:03.380\n it does the exact same.\n\n55:03.380 --> 55:04.200\n Got it.\n\n55:04.200 --> 55:09.200\n And so this is how in the system that we're devising here,\n\n55:10.040 --> 55:12.740\n communication is entirely binary.\n\n55:12.740 --> 55:15.020\n And that's what I tried to emphasize a second ago.\n\n55:15.020 --> 55:17.780\n Communication should not change the information.\n\n55:17.780 --> 55:21.300\n You're not saying, oh, I got this kind of communication\n\n55:21.300 --> 55:22.280\n event for photons.\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:23.700\n No, we're not keeping track of that.\n\n55:23.700 --> 55:26.580\n This neuron fired, this synapse says that neuron fired,\n\n55:26.580 --> 55:27.420\n that's it.\n\n55:27.420 --> 55:31.460\n So that's a noise filtering property of those detectors.\n\n55:31.460 --> 55:33.140\n However, there are other applications\n\n55:33.140 --> 55:36.140\n where you'd rather know the exact number of photons\n\n55:36.140 --> 55:39.300\n that can be very useful in quantum computing with light.\n\n55:39.300 --> 55:41.820\n And our group does a lot of work\n\n55:41.820 --> 55:44.580\n around another kind of superconducting sensor\n\n55:44.580 --> 55:48.260\n called a transition edge sensor that Adrian Alita\n\n55:48.260 --> 55:49.940\n in our group does a lot of work on that.\n\n55:49.940 --> 55:53.980\n And that can tell you based on the amplitude\n\n55:53.980 --> 55:58.180\n of the current pulse you divert exactly how many photons\n\n55:58.180 --> 55:59.780\n were in that pulse.\n\n56:00.900 --> 56:02.500\n What's that useful for?\n\n56:02.500 --> 56:04.700\n One way that you can encode information\n\n56:04.700 --> 56:07.460\n in quantum states of light is in the number of photons.\n\n56:07.460 --> 56:09.300\n You can have what are called number states\n\n56:09.300 --> 56:11.980\n and a number state will have a well defined number\n\n56:11.980 --> 56:16.400\n of photons and maybe the output of your quantum computation\n\n56:16.400 --> 56:19.780\n encodes its information in the number of photons\n\n56:19.780 --> 56:20.620\n that are generated.\n\n56:20.620 --> 56:23.020\n So if you have a detector that is sensitive to that,\n\n56:23.020 --> 56:24.300\n it's extremely useful.\n\n56:24.300 --> 56:29.240\n Can you achieve like a clock with photons\n\n56:29.240 --> 56:30.260\n or is that not important?\n\n56:30.260 --> 56:33.300\n Is there a synchronicity here?\n\n56:33.300 --> 56:35.380\n In general, it can be important.\n\n56:36.880 --> 56:39.380\n Clock distribution is a big challenge\n\n56:39.380 --> 56:43.300\n in especially large computational systems.\n\n56:43.300 --> 56:47.940\n And so yes, optical clocks, optical clock distribution\n\n56:47.940 --> 56:51.140\n is a very powerful technology.\n\n56:51.140 --> 56:53.180\n I don't know the state of that field right now,\n\n56:53.180 --> 56:55.620\n but I imagine that if you're trying to distribute a clock\n\n56:55.620 --> 56:58.960\n across any appreciable size computational system,\n\n56:58.960 --> 57:00.340\n you wanna use light.\n\n57:00.340 --> 57:04.300\n Yeah, I wonder how these giant systems work,\n\n57:04.300 --> 57:07.380\n especially like supercomputers.\n\n57:07.380 --> 57:09.380\n Do they need to do clock distribution\n\n57:09.380 --> 57:14.260\n or are they doing more ad hoc parallel\n\n57:14.260 --> 57:15.540\n like concurrent programming?\n\n57:15.540 --> 57:18.140\n Like there's some kind of locking mechanisms or something.\n\n57:18.140 --> 57:19.320\n That's a fascinating question,\n\n57:19.320 --> 57:23.900\n but let's zoom in at this very particular question\n\n57:23.900 --> 57:28.200\n of computation on a processor\n\n57:28.200 --> 57:31.560\n and communication between processors.\n\n57:31.560 --> 57:36.440\n So what does this system look like\n\n57:36.440 --> 57:38.220\n that you're envisioning?\n\n57:38.220 --> 57:40.100\n One of the places you're envisioning it\n\n57:40.100 --> 57:43.140\n is in the paper on optoelectronic intelligence.\n\n57:43.140 --> 57:44.740\n So what are we talking about?\n\n57:44.740 --> 57:46.300\n Are we talking about something\n\n57:46.300 --> 57:48.740\n that starts to look a lot like the human brain\n\n57:48.740 --> 57:51.300\n or does it still look a lot like a computer?\n\n57:51.300 --> 57:52.980\n What are the size of this thing?\n\n57:52.980 --> 57:55.140\n Is it going inside a smartphone or as you said,\n\n57:55.140 --> 57:58.580\n does it go inside something that's more like a house?\n\n57:58.580 --> 58:01.180\n Like what should we be imagining?\n\n58:01.180 --> 58:02.260\n What are you thinking about\n\n58:02.260 --> 58:05.460\n when you're thinking about these fundamental systems?\n\n58:05.460 --> 58:07.380\n Let me introduce the word neuromorphic.\n\n58:07.380 --> 58:09.960\n There's this concept of neuromorphic computing\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:12.580\n where what that broadly refers to\n\n58:12.580 --> 58:17.580\n is computing based on the information processing principles\n\n58:17.740 --> 58:19.260\n of the brain.\n\n58:19.260 --> 58:23.820\n And as digital computing seems to be pushing\n\n58:23.820 --> 58:26.480\n towards some fundamental performance limits,\n\n58:26.480 --> 58:29.180\n people are considering architectural advances,\n\n58:29.180 --> 58:30.860\n drawing inspiration from the brain,\n\n58:30.860 --> 58:33.660\n more distributed parallel network kind of architectures\n\n58:33.660 --> 58:34.500\n and stuff.\n\n58:34.500 --> 58:37.420\n And so there's this continuum of neuromorphic\n\n58:37.420 --> 58:42.420\n from things that are pretty similar to digital computers,\n\n58:42.740 --> 58:45.720\n but maybe there are more cores\n\n58:45.720 --> 58:49.180\n and the way they send messages is a little bit more\n\n58:49.180 --> 58:52.780\n like the way brain neurons send spikes.\n\n58:52.780 --> 58:56.100\n But for the most part, it's still digital electronics.\n\n58:56.100 --> 58:58.700\n And then you have some things in between\n\n58:58.700 --> 59:02.060\n where maybe you're using transistors,\n\n59:02.060 --> 59:03.220\n but now you're starting to use them\n\n59:03.220 --> 59:06.140\n instead of in a digital way, in an analog way.\n\n59:06.140 --> 59:08.180\n And so you're trying to get those circuits\n\n59:08.180 --> 59:10.320\n to behave more like neurons.\n\n59:10.320 --> 59:12.140\n And then that's a little bit,\n\n59:12.140 --> 59:14.940\n quite a bit more on the neuromorphic side of things.\n\n59:14.940 --> 59:17.080\n You're trying to get your circuits,\n\n59:17.080 --> 59:19.140\n although they're still based on silicon,\n\n59:19.140 --> 59:22.480\n you're trying to get them to perform operations\n\n59:22.480 --> 59:24.660\n that are highly analogous to the operations in the brain.\n\n59:24.660 --> 59:26.700\n And that's where a great deal of work is\n\n59:26.700 --> 59:27.700\n in neuromorphic computing,\n\n59:27.700 --> 59:30.920\n people like Giacomo Indoveri and Gert Kauenberg,\n\n59:30.920 --> 59:32.980\n Jennifer Hasler, countless others.\n\n59:32.980 --> 59:36.900\n It's a rich and exciting field going back to Carver Mead\n\n59:36.900 --> 59:39.460\n in the late 1980s.\n\n59:39.460 --> 59:44.240\n And then all the way on the other extreme of the continuum\n\n59:44.240 --> 59:48.580\n is where you say, I'll give up anything related\n\n59:48.580 --> 59:51.420\n to transistors or semiconductors or anything like that.\n\n59:51.420 --> 59:53.620\n I'm not starting with the assumption\n\n59:53.620 --> 59:55.060\n that I'm gonna use any kind\n\n59:55.060 --> 59:57.020\n of conventional computing hardware.\n\n59:57.020 --> 59:59.300\n And instead, what I wanna do is try and understand\n\n59:59.300 --> 1:00:00.700\n what makes the brain powerful\n\n1:00:00.700 --> 1:00:03.180\n at the kind of information processing it does.\n\n1:00:03.180 --> 1:00:05.540\n And I wanna think from first principles\n\n1:00:05.540 --> 1:00:10.540\n about what hardware is best going to enable us\n\n1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:14.020\n to capture those information processing principles\n\n1:00:14.020 --> 1:00:16.020\n in an artificial system.\n\n1:00:16.020 --> 1:00:17.420\n And that's where I live.\n\n1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:21.740\n That's where I'm doing my exploration these days.\n\n1:00:21.740 --> 1:00:25.800\n So what are the first principles\n\n1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:29.960\n of brain like computation communication?\n\n1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:32.580\n Right, yeah, this is so important\n\n1:00:32.580 --> 1:00:35.540\n and I'm glad we booked 14 hours for this because.\n\n1:00:35.540 --> 1:00:37.240\n I only have 13, I'm sorry.\n\n1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:41.500\n Okay, so the brain is notoriously complicated.\n\n1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:44.060\n And I think that's an important part\n\n1:00:44.060 --> 1:00:46.300\n of why it can do what it does.\n\n1:00:46.300 --> 1:00:48.700\n But okay, let me try to break it down.\n\n1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:54.580\n Starting with the devices, neurons, as I said before,\n\n1:00:54.580 --> 1:00:57.100\n they're sophisticated devices in and of themselves\n\n1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.220\n and synapses are too.\n\n1:00:58.220 --> 1:01:03.060\n They can change their state based on the activity.\n\n1:01:03.060 --> 1:01:04.900\n So they adapt over time.\n\n1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:06.980\n That's crucial to the way the brain works.\n\n1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:09.380\n They don't just adapt on one timescale,\n\n1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:12.460\n they can adapt on myriad timescales\n\n1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:16.060\n from the spacing between pulses,\n\n1:01:16.060 --> 1:01:18.700\n the spacing between spikes that come from neurons\n\n1:01:18.700 --> 1:01:21.540\n all the way to the age of the organism.\n\n1:01:23.100 --> 1:01:28.100\n Also relevant, perhaps I think the most important thing\n\n1:01:28.100 --> 1:01:32.320\n that's guided my thinking is the network structure\n\n1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:33.880\n of the brain, so.\n\n1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:36.600\n Which can also be adjusted on different scales.\n\n1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.440\n Absolutely, yes, so you're making new,\n\n1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:41.360\n you're changing the strength of contacts,\n\n1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:44.120\n you're changing the spatial distribution of them,\n\n1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:46.900\n although spatial distribution doesn't change that much\n\n1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:49.400\n once you're a mature organism.\n\n1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:52.880\n But that network structure is really crucial.\n\n1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:55.400\n So let me dwell on that for a second.\n\n1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:58.960\n You can't talk about the brain without emphasizing\n\n1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:02.880\n that most of the neurons in the neocortex\n\n1:02:02.880 --> 1:02:04.840\n or the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain\n\n1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:08.080\n that we think is most responsible for high level reasoning\n\n1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:09.080\n and things like that,\n\n1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:11.400\n those neurons make thousands of connections.\n\n1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:15.560\n So you have this network that is highly interconnected.\n\n1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.880\n And I think it's safe to say that one of the primary reasons\n\n1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:23.180\n that they make so many different connections\n\n1:02:23.180 --> 1:02:26.880\n is that allows information to be communicated very rapidly\n\n1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:28.420\n from any spot in the network\n\n1:02:28.420 --> 1:02:30.320\n to any other spot in the network.\n\n1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:33.920\n So that's a sort of spatial aspect of it.\n\n1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.480\n You can quantify this in terms of concepts\n\n1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:41.020\n that are related to fractals and scale invariants,\n\n1:02:41.020 --> 1:02:43.240\n which I think is a very beautiful concept.\n\n1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:46.200\n So what I mean by that is kind of,\n\n1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:50.720\n no matter what spatial scale you're looking at in the brain\n\n1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:53.520\n within certain bounds, you see the same\n\n1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:54.960\n general statistical pattern.\n\n1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:59.280\n So if I draw a box around some region of my cortex,\n\n1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:02.280\n most of the connections that those neurons\n\n1:03:02.280 --> 1:03:04.480\n within that box make are gonna be within the box\n\n1:03:04.480 --> 1:03:06.200\n to each other in their local neighborhood.\n\n1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:09.280\n And that's sort of called clustering, loosely speaking.\n\n1:03:09.280 --> 1:03:10.920\n But a non negligible fraction\n\n1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.600\n is gonna go outside of that box.\n\n1:03:12.600 --> 1:03:14.080\n And then if I draw a bigger box,\n\n1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:16.400\n the pattern is gonna be exactly the same.\n\n1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.400\n So you have this scale invariants,\n\n1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:22.720\n and you also have a non vanishing probability\n\n1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:25.400\n of a neuron making connection very far away.\n\n1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:28.720\n So suppose you wanna plot the probability\n\n1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.420\n of a neuron making a connection as a function of distance.\n\n1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:34.240\n If that were an exponential function,\n\n1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.720\n it would go e to the minus radius\n\n1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:38.700\n over some characteristic radius,\n\n1:03:38.700 --> 1:03:41.840\n and it would drop off up to some certain radius,\n\n1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.920\n the probability would be reasonably close to one,\n\n1:03:44.920 --> 1:03:49.120\n and then beyond that characteristic length R zero,\n\n1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:51.280\n it would drop off sharply.\n\n1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.560\n And so that would mean that the neurons in your brain\n\n1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:58.560\n are really localized, and that's not what we observe.\n\n1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.680\n Instead, what you see is that the probability\n\n1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:03.760\n of making a longer distance connection, it does drop off,\n\n1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:05.760\n but it drops off as a power law.\n\n1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:08.420\n So the probability that you're gonna have a connection\n\n1:04:08.420 --> 1:04:13.180\n at some radius R goes as R to the minus some power.\n\n1:04:13.180 --> 1:04:16.800\n And that's more, that's what we see with forces in nature,\n\n1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:18.440\n like the electromagnetic force\n\n1:04:18.440 --> 1:04:20.440\n between two particles or gravity\n\n1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:23.000\n goes as one over the radius squared.\n\n1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.420\n So you can see this in fractals.\n\n1:04:24.420 --> 1:04:28.600\n I love that there's like a fractal dynamics of the brain\n\n1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.460\n that if you zoom out, you draw the box\n\n1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:35.040\n and you increase that box by certain step sizes,\n\n1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:36.720\n you're gonna see the same statistics.\n\n1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:40.000\n I think that's probably very important\n\n1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.880\n to the way the brain processes information.\n\n1:04:41.880 --> 1:04:43.600\n It's not just in the spatial domain,\n\n1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:45.640\n it's also in the temporal domain.\n\n1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:47.240\n And what I mean by that is...\n\n1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.640\n That's incredible that this emerged\n\n1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:52.320\n through the evolutionary process\n\n1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:54.880\n that potentially somehow connected\n\n1:04:54.880 --> 1:04:57.800\n to the way the physics of the universe works.\n\n1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:00.360\n Yeah, I couldn't agree more that it's a deep\n\n1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:02.720\n and fascinating subject that I hope to be able\n\n1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:04.160\n to spend the rest of my life studying.\n\n1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:07.280\n You think you need to solve, understand this,\n\n1:05:07.280 --> 1:05:10.120\n this fractal nature in order to understand intelligence\n\n1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:11.520\n and communication. I do think so.\n\n1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:13.320\n I think they're deeply intertwined.\n\n1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.880\n Yes, I think power laws are right at the heart of it.\n\n1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:19.400\n So just to push that one through,\n\n1:05:19.400 --> 1:05:21.480\n the same thing happens in the temporal domain.\n\n1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:26.000\n So suppose your neurons in your brain\n\n1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.160\n were always oscillating at the same frequency,\n\n1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:31.320\n then the probability of finding a neuron oscillating\n\n1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:32.520\n as a function of frequency\n\n1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:34.520\n would be this narrowly peaked function\n\n1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:36.520\n around that certain characteristic frequency.\n\n1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:37.880\n That's not at all what we see.\n\n1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:40.240\n The probability of finding neurons oscillating\n\n1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:43.880\n or producing spikes at a certain frequency\n\n1:05:43.880 --> 1:05:45.200\n is again a power law,\n\n1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:49.640\n which means there's no defined scale\n\n1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.720\n of the temporal activity in the brain.\n\n1:05:53.560 --> 1:05:56.040\n At what speed do your thoughts occur?\n\n1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:58.280\n Well, there's a fastest speed they can occur\n\n1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:01.520\n and that is limited by communication and other things,\n\n1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:03.960\n but there's not a characteristic scale.\n\n1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:06.880\n We have thoughts on all temporal scales\n\n1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:10.800\n from a few tens of milliseconds,\n\n1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:13.360\n which is physiologically limited by our devices,\n\n1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.720\n compare that to tens of picoseconds\n\n1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:17.120\n that I talked about in superconductors,\n\n1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:19.240\n all the way up to the lifetime of the organism.\n\n1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:20.720\n You can still think about things\n\n1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:22.560\n that happened to you when you were a kid.\n\n1:06:22.560 --> 1:06:24.040\n Or if you wanna be really trippy\n\n1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:25.840\n then across multiple organisms\n\n1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:27.440\n in the entirety of human civilization,\n\n1:06:27.440 --> 1:06:29.400\n you have thoughts that span organisms, right?\n\n1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:31.200\n Yes, taking it to that level, yes.\n\n1:06:31.200 --> 1:06:34.600\n If you're willing to see the entirety of the human species\n\n1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:37.160\n as a single organism with a collective intelligence\n\n1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.880\n and that too on a spatial and temporal scale,\n\n1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:41.080\n there's thoughts occurring.\n\n1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:44.000\n And then if you look at not just the human species,\n\n1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:46.440\n but the entirety of life on earth\n\n1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:49.600\n as an organism with thoughts that are occurring,\n\n1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:51.600\n that are greater and greater sophisticated thoughts,\n\n1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:54.640\n there's a different spatial and temporal scale there.\n\n1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:57.200\n This is getting very suspicious.\n\n1:06:57.200 --> 1:06:58.640\n Well, hold on though, before we're done,\n\n1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:00.960\n I just wanna just tie the bow\n\n1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:04.280\n and say that the spatial and temporal aspects\n\n1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:06.440\n are intimately interrelated with each other.\n\n1:07:06.440 --> 1:07:10.320\n So activity between neurons that are very close to each other\n\n1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:13.560\n is more likely to happen on this faster timescale\n\n1:07:13.560 --> 1:07:15.280\n and information is gonna propagate\n\n1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:17.200\n and encompass more of the brain,\n\n1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.280\n more of your cortices, different modules in the brain\n\n1:07:20.280 --> 1:07:23.720\n are gonna be engaged in information processing\n\n1:07:23.720 --> 1:07:25.280\n on longer timescales.\n\n1:07:25.280 --> 1:07:27.960\n So there's this concept of information integration\n\n1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.960\n where neurons are specialized.\n\n1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:33.960\n Any given neuron or any cluster of neuron\n\n1:07:33.960 --> 1:07:35.720\n has its specific purpose,\n\n1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.880\n but they're also very much integrated.\n\n1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:41.880\n So you have neurons that specialize,\n\n1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:43.640\n but share their information.\n\n1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:47.560\n And so that happens through these fractal nested oscillations\n\n1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:49.400\n that occur across spatial and temporal scales.\n\n1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:53.640\n I think capturing those dynamics in hardware,\n\n1:07:53.640 --> 1:07:57.040\n to me, that's the goal of neuromorphic computing.\n\n1:07:57.040 --> 1:07:58.680\n So does it need to look,\n\n1:07:58.680 --> 1:08:00.800\n so first of all, that's fascinating.\n\n1:08:00.800 --> 1:08:03.960\n We stated some clear principles here.\n\n1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:08.120\n Now, does it have to look like the brain\n\n1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:09.800\n outside of those principles as well?\n\n1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:11.320\n Like what other characteristics\n\n1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:13.080\n have to look like the human brain?\n\n1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:15.840\n Or can it be something very different?\n\n1:08:15.840 --> 1:08:18.000\n Well, it depends on what you're trying to use it for.\n\n1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.760\n And so I think a lot of the community\n\n1:08:21.720 --> 1:08:23.080\n asks that question a lot.\n\n1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:24.360\n What are you gonna do with it?\n\n1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:26.600\n And I completely get it.\n\n1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:28.040\n I think that's a very important question.\n\n1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:31.840\n And it's also sometimes not the most helpful question.\n\n1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:33.800\n What if what you wanna do with it is study it?\n\n1:08:33.800 --> 1:08:35.120\n What if you just wanna see,\n\n1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:39.280\n what do you have to build into your hardware\n\n1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:41.880\n in order to observe these dynamical principles?\n\n1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:47.520\n And also, I ask myself that question every day\n\n1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:49.880\n and I'm not sure I'm able to answer that.\n\n1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:51.200\n So like, what are you gonna do\n\n1:08:51.200 --> 1:08:53.480\n with this particular neuromorphic machine?\n\n1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:55.320\n So suppose what we're trying to do with it\n\n1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:56.960\n is build something that thinks.\n\n1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:59.160\n We're not trying to get it to make us any money\n\n1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:00.240\n or drive a car.\n\n1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:02.640\n Maybe we'll be able to do that, but that's not our goal.\n\n1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:07.600\n Our goal is to see if we can get the same types of behaviors\n\n1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:08.920\n that we observe in our own brain.\n\n1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:10.480\n And by behaviors in this sense,\n\n1:09:10.480 --> 1:09:14.320\n what I mean the behaviors of the components,\n\n1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:16.000\n the neurons, the network, that kind of stuff.\n\n1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:19.120\n I think there's another element that I didn't really hit on\n\n1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:21.200\n that you also have to build into this.\n\n1:09:21.200 --> 1:09:22.920\n And those are architectural principles.\n\n1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:26.680\n They have to do with the hierarchical modular construction\n\n1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:27.520\n of the network.\n\n1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:30.200\n And without getting too lost in jargon,\n\n1:09:30.200 --> 1:09:33.680\n the main point that I think is relevant there,\n\n1:09:33.680 --> 1:09:35.720\n let me try and illustrate it with a cartoon picture\n\n1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:38.200\n of the architecture of the brain.\n\n1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:41.120\n So in the brain, you have the cortex,\n\n1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.560\n which is sort of this outer sheet.\n\n1:09:44.440 --> 1:09:46.720\n It's actually, it's a layered structure.\n\n1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:48.480\n You can, if you could take it out of your brain,\n\n1:09:48.480 --> 1:09:50.680\n you could unroll it on the table\n\n1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:53.560\n and it would be about the size of a pizza sitting there.\n\n1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:56.400\n And that's a module.\n\n1:09:56.400 --> 1:09:57.800\n It does certain things.\n\n1:09:57.800 --> 1:10:00.680\n It processes as Yogi Buzaki would say,\n\n1:10:00.680 --> 1:10:03.560\n it processes the what of what's going on around you.\n\n1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:06.200\n But you have another really crucial module\n\n1:10:06.200 --> 1:10:08.040\n that's called the hippocampus.\n\n1:10:08.040 --> 1:10:10.520\n And that network is structured entirely differently.\n\n1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:12.800\n First of all, this cortex that had described\n\n1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:14.640\n 10 billion neurons in there.\n\n1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:16.840\n So numbers matter here.\n\n1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:20.360\n And they're organized in that sort of power law distribution\n\n1:10:20.360 --> 1:10:22.880\n where the probability of making a connection drops off\n\n1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:24.520\n as a power law in space.\n\n1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.840\n The hippocampus is another module that's important\n\n1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:30.880\n for understanding how, where you are,\n\n1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:35.880\n when you are keeping track of your position\n\n1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:37.280\n in space and time.\n\n1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:39.280\n And that network is very much random.\n\n1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:41.960\n So the probability of making a connection,\n\n1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:44.760\n it almost doesn't even drop off as a function of distance.\n\n1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:46.720\n It's the same probability that you'll make it here\n\n1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.520\n to over there, but there are only about 100 million neurons\n\n1:10:50.520 --> 1:10:54.680\n there, so you can have that huge densely connected module\n\n1:10:54.680 --> 1:10:57.280\n because it's not so big.\n\n1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:02.040\n And the neocortex or the cortex and the hippocampus,\n\n1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:04.920\n they talk to each other constantly.\n\n1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:07.920\n And that communication is largely facilitated\n\n1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:09.720\n by what's called the thalamus.\n\n1:11:09.720 --> 1:11:10.880\n I'm not a neuroscientist here.\n\n1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:12.960\n I'm trying to do my best to recite things.\n\n1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:14.680\n Cartoon picture of the brain, I gotcha.\n\n1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:15.560\n Yeah, something like that.\n\n1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:18.640\n So this thalamus is coordinating the activity\n\n1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:20.760\n between the neocortex and the hippocampus\n\n1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:23.560\n and making sure that they talk to each other\n\n1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:25.280\n at the right time and send messages\n\n1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:26.840\n that will be useful to one another.\n\n1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:29.120\n So this all taken together is called\n\n1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:31.600\n the thalamocortical complex.\n\n1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:34.880\n And it seems like building something like that\n\n1:11:34.880 --> 1:11:39.280\n is going to be crucial to capturing the types of activity\n\n1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:43.400\n we're looking for because those responsibilities,\n\n1:11:43.400 --> 1:11:45.720\n those separate modules, they do different things,\n\n1:11:45.720 --> 1:11:50.720\n that's gotta be central to achieving these states\n\n1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:54.840\n of efficient information integration across space and time.\n\n1:11:55.720 --> 1:11:58.960\n By the way, I am able to achieve this state\n\n1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:01.800\n by watching simulations, visualizations\n\n1:12:01.800 --> 1:12:03.800\n of the thalamocortical complex.\n\n1:12:03.800 --> 1:12:06.440\n There's a few people I forget from where.\n\n1:12:06.440 --> 1:12:09.880\n They've created these incredible visual illustrations\n\n1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:14.880\n of visual stimulation from the eye or something like that.\n\n1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:18.520\n And this image flowing through the brain.\n\n1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:20.880\n Wow, I haven't seen that, I gotta check that out.\n\n1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:22.120\n So it's one of those things,\n\n1:12:22.120 --> 1:12:24.280\n you find this stuff in the world,\n\n1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:26.960\n and you see on YouTube, it has 1,000 views,\n\n1:12:26.960 --> 1:12:30.800\n these visualizations of the human brain\n\n1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:32.120\n processing information.\n\n1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:36.440\n And because there's chemistry there,\n\n1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:38.880\n because this is from actual human brains,\n\n1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.720\n I don't know how they're doing the coloring,\n\n1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.840\n but they're able to actually trace\n\n1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.680\n the different, the chemical and the electrical signals\n\n1:12:46.680 --> 1:12:48.880\n throughout the brain, and the visual thing,\n\n1:12:48.880 --> 1:12:51.800\n it's like, whoa, because it looks kinda like the universe,\n\n1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:53.800\n I mean, the whole thing is just incredible.\n\n1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.640\n I recommend it highly, I'll probably post a link to it.\n\n1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.960\n But you can just look for, one of the things they simulate\n\n1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:05.840\n is the thalamocortical complex and just visualization.\n\n1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.520\n You can find that yourself on YouTube, but it's beautiful.\n\n1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:11.320\n The other question I have for you is,\n\n1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.440\n how does memory play into all of this?\n\n1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:17.120\n Because all the signals sending back and forth,\n\n1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:20.880\n that's computation and communication,\n\n1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:25.880\n but that's kinda like processing of inputs and outputs,\n\n1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.560\n to produce outputs in the system,\n\n1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:29.000\n that's kinda like maybe reasoning,\n\n1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.920\n maybe there's some kind of recurrence.\n\n1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:33.920\n But is there a storage mechanism that you think about\n\n1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:35.840\n in the context of neuromorphic computing?\n\n1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:37.760\n Yeah, absolutely, so that's gotta be central.\n\n1:13:37.760 --> 1:13:41.520\n You have to have a way that you can store memories.\n\n1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:43.600\n And there are a lot of different kinds\n\n1:13:43.600 --> 1:13:45.480\n of memory in the brain.\n\n1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.160\n That's yet another example of how it's not a simple system.\n\n1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:53.000\n So there's one kind of memory,\n\n1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.880\n one way of talking about memory,\n\n1:13:56.040 --> 1:13:59.040\n usually starts in the context of Hopfield networks.\n\n1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.440\n You were lucky to talk to John Hopfield on this program.\n\n1:14:02.440 --> 1:14:05.840\n But the basic idea there is working memory\n\n1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:07.840\n is stored in the dynamical patterns\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:10.400\n of activity between neurons.\n\n1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:14.760\n And you can think of a certain pattern of activity\n\n1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:19.680\n as an attractor, meaning if you put in some signal\n\n1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.400\n that's similar enough to other\n\n1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:26.480\n previously experienced signals like that,\n\n1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:29.600\n then you're going to converge to the same network dynamics\n\n1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:31.760\n and you will see these neurons\n\n1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.200\n participate in the same network patterns of activity\n\n1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:37.600\n that they have in the past.\n\n1:14:37.600 --> 1:14:39.720\n So you can talk about the probability\n\n1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:42.520\n that different inputs will allow you to converge\n\n1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:44.240\n to different basins of attraction\n\n1:14:44.240 --> 1:14:46.600\n and you might think of that as,\n\n1:14:46.600 --> 1:14:49.040\n oh, I saw this face and then I excited\n\n1:14:49.040 --> 1:14:50.920\n this network pattern of activity\n\n1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:53.080\n because last time I saw that face,\n\n1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:56.960\n I was at some movie and that's a famous person\n\n1:14:56.960 --> 1:14:58.120\n that's on the screen or something like that.\n\n1:14:58.120 --> 1:15:00.560\n So that's one memory storage mechanism.\n\n1:15:00.560 --> 1:15:04.400\n But crucial to the ability to imprint those memories\n\n1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.040\n in your brain is the ability to change\n\n1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:11.360\n the strength of connection between one neuron and another,\n\n1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:13.280\n that synaptic connection between them.\n\n1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:18.000\n So synaptic weight update is a massive field of neuroscience\n\n1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:19.560\n and neuromorphic computing as well.\n\n1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:24.560\n So there are two poles on that spectrum.\n\n1:15:26.720 --> 1:15:28.880\n Okay, so more in the language of machine learning,\n\n1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:32.000\n we would talk about supervised and unsupervised learning.\n\n1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.960\n And when I'm trying to tie that down\n\n1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:35.520\n to neuromorphic computing,\n\n1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.440\n I will use a definition of supervised learning,\n\n1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:42.960\n which basically means the external user,\n\n1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:45.520\n the person who's controlling this hardware\n\n1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:48.360\n has some knob that they can tune\n\n1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.400\n to change each of the synaptic weights,\n\n1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:52.160\n depending on whether or not the network\n\n1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:53.560\n is doing what you want it to do.\n\n1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:56.120\n Whereas what I mean in this conversation\n\n1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:57.600\n when I say unsupervised learning\n\n1:15:57.600 --> 1:15:59.400\n is that those synaptic weights\n\n1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:03.120\n are dynamically changing in your network\n\n1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:05.000\n based on nothing that the user is doing,\n\n1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.080\n nothing that there's no wire from the outside\n\n1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:09.040\n going into any of those synapses.\n\n1:16:09.040 --> 1:16:12.080\n The network itself is reconfiguring those synaptic weights\n\n1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:15.760\n based on physical properties\n\n1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:17.600\n that you've built into the devices.\n\n1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:21.400\n So if the synapse receives a pulse from here\n\n1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:23.360\n and that causes the neuron to spike,\n\n1:16:23.360 --> 1:16:27.040\n some circuit built in there with no help from me\n\n1:16:27.040 --> 1:16:29.200\n or anybody else adjust the weight\n\n1:16:29.200 --> 1:16:31.400\n in a way that makes it more likely\n\n1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:34.600\n to store the useful information\n\n1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:36.360\n and excite the useful network patterns\n\n1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:39.360\n and makes it less likely that random noise,\n\n1:16:39.360 --> 1:16:41.440\n useless communication events\n\n1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:45.320\n will have an important effect on the network activity.\n\n1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:48.280\n So there's memory encoded in the weights,\n\n1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:49.760\n the synaptic weights.\n\n1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:51.880\n What about the formation of something\n\n1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.680\n that's not often done in machine learning,\n\n1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:56.280\n the formation of new synaptic connections?\n\n1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:57.440\n Right, well, that seems to,\n\n1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:00.120\n so again, not a neuroscientist here,\n\n1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:01.960\n but my reading of the literature\n\n1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:04.000\n is that that's particularly crucial\n\n1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.400\n in early stages of brain development\n\n1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:09.160\n where a newborn is born\n\n1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:11.680\n with tons of extra synaptic connections\n\n1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.880\n and it's actually pruned over time.\n\n1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:16.800\n So the number of synapses decreases\n\n1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:19.680\n as opposed to growing new long distance connections.\n\n1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.280\n It is possible in the brain to grow new neurons\n\n1:17:22.280 --> 1:17:26.080\n and assign new synaptic connections\n\n1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:29.120\n but it doesn't seem to be the primary mechanism\n\n1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:31.840\n by which the brain is learning.\n\n1:17:31.840 --> 1:17:34.280\n So for example, like right now,\n\n1:17:34.280 --> 1:17:35.720\n sitting here talking to you,\n\n1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:37.000\n you say lots of interesting things\n\n1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.760\n and I learn from you\n\n1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:41.240\n and I can remember things that you just said\n\n1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:44.720\n and I didn't grow new axonal connections\n\n1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.360\n down to new synapses to enable those.\n\n1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:50.160\n It's plasticity mechanisms\n\n1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:52.920\n in the synaptic connections between neurons\n\n1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.960\n that enable me to learn on that timescale.\n\n1:17:55.960 --> 1:17:57.560\n So at the very least,\n\n1:17:57.560 --> 1:17:59.880\n you can sufficiently approximate that\n\n1:17:59.880 --> 1:18:01.360\n with just weight updates.\n\n1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:02.920\n You don't need to form new connections.\n\n1:18:02.920 --> 1:18:05.040\n I would say weight updates are a big part of it.\n\n1:18:05.040 --> 1:18:06.200\n I also think there's more\n\n1:18:06.200 --> 1:18:08.600\n because broadly speaking,\n\n1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:10.440\n when we're doing machine learning,\n\n1:18:10.440 --> 1:18:12.480\n our networks, say we're talking about feed forward,\n\n1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:14.120\n deep neural networks,\n\n1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:16.960\n the temporal domain is not really part of it.\n\n1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:18.200\n Okay, you're gonna put in an image\n\n1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:20.400\n and you're gonna get out a classification\n\n1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:22.000\n and you're gonna do that as fast as possible.\n\n1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:23.160\n So you care about time\n\n1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.640\n but time is not part of the essence of this thing really.\n\n1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:30.040\n Whereas in spiking neural networks,\n\n1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:31.760\n what we see in the brain,\n\n1:18:31.760 --> 1:18:33.360\n time is as crucial as space\n\n1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:34.600\n and they're intimately intertwined\n\n1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:36.000\n as I've tried to say.\n\n1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:40.280\n And so adaptation on different timescales\n\n1:18:40.280 --> 1:18:44.120\n is important not just in memory formation,\n\n1:18:44.120 --> 1:18:45.360\n although it plays a key role there,\n\n1:18:45.360 --> 1:18:48.240\n but also in just keeping the activity\n\n1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:50.320\n in a useful dynamic range.\n\n1:18:50.320 --> 1:18:52.520\n So you have other plasticity mechanisms,\n\n1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:54.200\n not just weight update,\n\n1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:56.760\n or at least not on the timescale\n\n1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.760\n of many action potentials,\n\n1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:00.200\n but even on the shorter timescale.\n\n1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.720\n So a synapse can become much less efficacious.\n\n1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:07.200\n It can transmit a weaker signal\n\n1:19:07.200 --> 1:19:08.800\n after the second, third, fourth,\n\n1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:11.960\n that can second, third, fourth action potential\n\n1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:13.040\n to occur in a sequence.\n\n1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:15.960\n So that's what's called short term synaptic plasticity,\n\n1:19:15.960 --> 1:19:17.600\n which is a form of learning.\n\n1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:19.640\n You're learning that I'm getting too much stimulus\n\n1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:21.640\n from looking at something bright right now.\n\n1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:23.360\n So I need to tone that down.\n\n1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:28.080\n There's also another really important mechanism\n\n1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:30.520\n in learning that's called metoplasticity.\n\n1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:33.560\n What that seems to be is a way\n\n1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:37.400\n that you change not the weights themselves,\n\n1:19:37.400 --> 1:19:40.280\n but the rate at which the weights change.\n\n1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:45.280\n So when I am in say a lecture hall and my,\n\n1:19:45.440 --> 1:19:48.400\n this is a potentially terrible cartoon example,\n\n1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:49.680\n but let's say I'm in a lecture hall\n\n1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:51.960\n and it's time to learn, right?\n\n1:19:51.960 --> 1:19:54.280\n So my brain will release more,\n\n1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:57.240\n perhaps dopamine or some neuromodulator\n\n1:19:57.240 --> 1:20:00.320\n that's gonna change the rate\n\n1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:02.240\n at which synaptic plasticity occurs.\n\n1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:03.840\n So that can make me more sensitive\n\n1:20:03.840 --> 1:20:05.320\n to learning at certain times,\n\n1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:08.360\n more sensitive to overriding previous information\n\n1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:10.320\n and less sensitive at other times.\n\n1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:13.200\n And finally, as long as I'm rattling off the list,\n\n1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:16.480\n I think another concept that falls in the category\n\n1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:20.560\n of learning or memory adaptation is homeostasis\n\n1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:22.440\n or homeostatic adaptation,\n\n1:20:22.440 --> 1:20:24.960\n where neurons have the ability\n\n1:20:24.960 --> 1:20:27.800\n to control their firing rate.\n\n1:20:27.800 --> 1:20:31.200\n So if one neuron is just like blasting way too much,\n\n1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.000\n it will naturally tone itself down.\n\n1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.520\n Its threshold will adjust\n\n1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:38.520\n so that it stays in a useful dynamical range.\n\n1:20:38.520 --> 1:20:41.680\n And we see that that's captured in deep neural networks\n\n1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.320\n where you don't just change the synaptic weights,\n\n1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:46.680\n but you can also move the thresholds of simple neurons\n\n1:20:46.680 --> 1:20:47.520\n in those models.\n\n1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:52.520\n And so to achieve the spiking neural networks,\n\n1:20:53.800 --> 1:20:55.640\n you want to use,\n\n1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:01.200\n you want to implement the first principles\n\n1:21:01.200 --> 1:21:03.400\n that you mentioned of the temporal\n\n1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:07.040\n and the spatial fractal dynamics here.\n\n1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:09.240\n So you can communicate locally,\n\n1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:13.320\n you can communicate across much greater distances\n\n1:21:13.320 --> 1:21:16.000\n and do the same thing in space\n\n1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.040\n and do the same thing in time.\n\n1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:21.040\n Now, you have like a chapter called\n\n1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:24.360\n Superconducting Hardware for Neuromorphic Computing.\n\n1:21:24.360 --> 1:21:27.760\n So what are some ideas that integrate\n\n1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:29.080\n some of the things we've been talking about\n\n1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:32.080\n in terms of the first principles of neuromorphic computing\n\n1:21:32.080 --> 1:21:34.280\n and the ideas that you outline\n\n1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:38.040\n in optoelectronic intelligence?\n\n1:21:38.040 --> 1:21:40.920\n Yeah, so let me start, I guess,\n\n1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:42.520\n on the communication side of things,\n\n1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:46.280\n because that's what led us down this track\n\n1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.120\n in the first place.\n\n1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:51.800\n By us, I'm talking about my team of colleagues at NIST,\n\n1:21:51.800 --> 1:21:54.800\n Saeed Han, Bryce Brimavera, Sonia Buckley,\n\n1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:57.200\n Jeff Chiles, Adam McCallum to name,\n\n1:21:57.200 --> 1:21:58.720\n Alex Tate to name a few,\n\n1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:01.240\n our group leaders, Saewoo Nam and Rich Mirren.\n\n1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.480\n We've all contributed to this.\n\n1:22:02.480 --> 1:22:05.880\n So this is not me saying necessarily\n\n1:22:05.880 --> 1:22:07.560\n just the things that I've proposed,\n\n1:22:07.560 --> 1:22:09.600\n but sort of where our team's thinking\n\n1:22:09.600 --> 1:22:11.560\n has evolved over the years.\n\n1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:14.720\n Can I quickly ask, what is NIST\n\n1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:18.080\n and where is this amazing group of people located?\n\n1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:21.800\n NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n1:22:23.120 --> 1:22:26.720\n The larger facility is out in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\n1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:29.720\n Our team is located in Boulder, Colorado.\n\n1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:36.240\n NIST is a federal agency under the Department of Commerce.\n\n1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:40.160\n We do a lot with, by we, I mean other people at NIST,\n\n1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.040\n do a lot with standards,\n\n1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:46.080\n making sure that we understand the system of units,\n\n1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:49.320\n international system of units, precision measurements.\n\n1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:53.560\n There's a lot going on in electrical engineering,\n\n1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:54.760\n material science.\n\n1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.000\n And it's historic.\n\n1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.280\n I mean, it's one of those, it's like MIT\n\n1:22:58.280 --> 1:22:59.120\n or something like that.\n\n1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:00.960\n It has a reputation over many decades\n\n1:23:00.960 --> 1:23:04.240\n of just being this really a place\n\n1:23:04.240 --> 1:23:06.520\n where there's a lot of brilliant people have done\n\n1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:07.600\n a lot of amazing things.\n\n1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:10.600\n But in terms of the people in your team,\n\n1:23:10.600 --> 1:23:12.760\n in this team of people involved\n\n1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:14.600\n in the concept we're talking about now,\n\n1:23:14.600 --> 1:23:15.440\n I'm just curious,\n\n1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:17.240\n what kind of disciplines are we talking about?\n\n1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.080\n What is it?\n\n1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.240\n Mostly physicists and electrical engineers,\n\n1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:21.880\n some material scientists,\n\n1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:24.840\n but I would say,\n\n1:23:24.840 --> 1:23:27.240\n yeah, I think physicists and electrical engineers,\n\n1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:29.480\n my background is in photonics,\n\n1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:31.040\n the use of light for technology.\n\n1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:36.040\n So coming from there, I tend to have found colleagues\n\n1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.240\n that are more from that background.\n\n1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:40.240\n Although Adam McConn,\n\n1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:42.720\n more of a superconducting electronics background,\n\n1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.280\n we need a diversity of folks.\n\n1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:46.840\n This project is sort of cross disciplinary.\n\n1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:48.280\n I would love to be working more\n\n1:23:48.280 --> 1:23:50.800\n with neuroscientists and things,\n\n1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:53.880\n but we haven't reached that scale yet.\n\n1:23:53.880 --> 1:23:54.720\n But yeah.\n\n1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:56.480\n You're focused on the hardware side,\n\n1:23:56.480 --> 1:23:59.160\n which requires all the disciplines that you mentioned.\n\n1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:00.000\n And then of course,\n\n1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.120\n neuroscientists may be a source of inspiration\n\n1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:04.360\n for some of the longterm vision.\n\n1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:06.240\n I would actually call it more than inspiration.\n\n1:24:06.240 --> 1:24:11.120\n I would call it sort of a roadmap.\n\n1:24:11.120 --> 1:24:15.000\n We're not trying to build exactly the brain,\n\n1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.520\n but I don't think it's enough to just say,\n\n1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:19.240\n oh, neurons kind of work like that.\n\n1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:20.760\n Let's kind of do that thing.\n\n1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.360\n I mean, we're very much following the concepts\n\n1:24:25.360 --> 1:24:27.440\n that the cognitive sciences have laid out for us,\n\n1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:30.520\n which I believe is a really robust roadmap.\n\n1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:33.040\n I mean, just on a little bit of a tangent,\n\n1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:36.080\n it's often stated that we just don't understand the brain.\n\n1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:37.960\n And so it's really hard to replicate it\n\n1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:40.200\n because we just don't know what's going on there.\n\n1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:43.560\n And maybe five or seven years ago,\n\n1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:44.800\n I would have said that,\n\n1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:47.880\n but as I got more interested in the subject,\n\n1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:50.480\n I read more of the neuroscience literature\n\n1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:53.640\n and I was just taken by the exact opposite sense.\n\n1:24:53.640 --> 1:24:55.880\n I can't believe how much they know about this.\n\n1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:59.320\n I can't believe how mathematically rigorous\n\n1:24:59.320 --> 1:25:02.960\n and sort of theoretically complete\n\n1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:04.240\n a lot of the concepts are.\n\n1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:06.680\n That's not to say we understand consciousness\n\n1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:08.560\n or we understand the self or anything like that,\n\n1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:11.040\n but what is the brain doing\n\n1:25:11.040 --> 1:25:13.600\n and why is it doing those things?\n\n1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:16.000\n Neuroscientists have a lot of answers to those questions.\n\n1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.840\n So if you're a hardware designer\n\n1:25:17.840 --> 1:25:19.440\n that just wants to get going,\n\n1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:23.000\n whoa, it's pretty clear which direction to go in, I think.\n\n1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:28.000\n Okay, so I love the optimism behind that,\n\n1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:31.120\n but in the implementation of these systems\n\n1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:37.640\n that uses superconductivity, how do you make it happen?\n\n1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:41.880\n So to me, it starts with thinking\n\n1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:43.400\n about the communication network.\n\n1:25:43.400 --> 1:25:47.560\n You know for sure that the ability of each neuron\n\n1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:50.560\n to communicate to many thousands of colleagues\n\n1:25:50.560 --> 1:25:52.360\n across the network is indispensable.\n\n1:25:52.360 --> 1:25:56.280\n I take that as a core principle of my architecture,\n\n1:25:56.280 --> 1:25:58.440\n my thinking on the subject.\n\n1:25:58.440 --> 1:26:02.280\n So coming from a background in photonics,\n\n1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:03.560\n it was very natural to say,\n\n1:26:03.560 --> 1:26:05.360\n okay, we're gonna use light for communication.\n\n1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:08.720\n Just in case listeners may not know,\n\n1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:10.840\n light is often used in communication.\n\n1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.720\n I mean, if you think about radio, that's light,\n\n1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.320\n it's long wavelengths, but it's electromagnetic radiation.\n\n1:26:15.320 --> 1:26:17.640\n It's the same physical phenomenon\n\n1:26:17.640 --> 1:26:20.200\n obeying exactly the same Maxwell's equations.\n\n1:26:20.200 --> 1:26:24.920\n And then all the way down to fiber, fiber optics.\n\n1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:26.240\n Now you're using visible\n\n1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.800\n or near infrared wavelengths of light,\n\n1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:30.360\n but the way you send messages across the ocean\n\n1:26:30.360 --> 1:26:33.200\n is now contemporary over optical fibers.\n\n1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:37.480\n So using light for communication is not a stretch.\n\n1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:38.960\n It makes perfect sense.\n\n1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.520\n So you might ask, well, why don't you use light\n\n1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:45.280\n for communication in a conventional microchip?\n\n1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:49.280\n And the answer to that is, I believe, physical.\n\n1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:53.080\n If we had a light source on a silicon chip\n\n1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.880\n that was as simple as a transistor,\n\n1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:58.240\n there would not be a processor in the world\n\n1:26:58.240 --> 1:26:59.760\n that didn't use light for communication,\n\n1:26:59.760 --> 1:27:01.800\n at least above some distance.\n\n1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.080\n How many light sources are needed?\n\n1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:06.840\n Oh, you need a light source at every single point.\n\n1:27:06.840 --> 1:27:08.440\n A light source per neuron.\n\n1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:09.960\n Per neuron, per little,\n\n1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:13.120\n but then if you could have a really small\n\n1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.080\n and nice light source,\n\n1:27:15.080 --> 1:27:17.960\n your definition of neuron could be flexible.\n\n1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:19.200\n Could be, yes, yes.\n\n1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:21.720\n Sometimes it's helpful to me to say,\n\n1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.560\n in this hardware, a neuron is that entity\n\n1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:25.720\n which has a light source.\n\n1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:27.960\n That, and I can explain.\n\n1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:29.520\n And then there was light.\n\n1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:32.280\n I mean, I can explain more about that, but.\n\n1:27:32.280 --> 1:27:34.680\n Somehow this like rhymes with consciousness\n\n1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:38.240\n because people will often say the light of consciousness.\n\n1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:41.680\n So that consciousness is that which is conscious.\n\n1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:42.520\n I got it.\n\n1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:44.840\n That's not my quote.\n\n1:27:44.840 --> 1:27:47.000\n That's me, that's my quote.\n\n1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.520\n You see, that quote comes from my background.\n\n1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:53.600\n Yours is in optics, mine in light, mine's in darkness.\n\n1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:56.920\n So go ahead.\n\n1:27:56.920 --> 1:27:59.640\n So the point I was making there is that\n\n1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:02.960\n if it was easy to manufacture light sources\n\n1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:05.760\n along with transistors on a silicon chip,\n\n1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:07.240\n they would be everywhere.\n\n1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:08.880\n And it's not easy.\n\n1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:10.160\n People have been trying for decades\n\n1:28:10.160 --> 1:28:11.960\n and it's actually extremely difficult.\n\n1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:14.040\n I think an important part of our research\n\n1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.960\n is dwelling right at that spot there.\n\n1:28:16.960 --> 1:28:17.800\n So.\n\n1:28:17.800 --> 1:28:18.720\n Is it physics or engineering?\n\n1:28:18.720 --> 1:28:19.560\n It's physics.\n\n1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:22.280\n So, okay, so it's physics, I think.\n\n1:28:22.280 --> 1:28:26.920\n So what I mean by that is, as we discussed,\n\n1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:29.400\n silicon is the material of choice for transistors\n\n1:28:29.400 --> 1:28:33.280\n and it's very difficult to imagine\n\n1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:35.200\n that that's gonna change anytime soon.\n\n1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.160\n Silicon is notoriously bad at emitting light.\n\n1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:43.320\n And that has to do with the immutable properties\n\n1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:44.160\n of silicon itself.\n\n1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:47.880\n The way that the energy bands are structured in silicon,\n\n1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.520\n you're never going to make silicon efficient\n\n1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:53.520\n as a light source at room temperature\n\n1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:55.640\n without doing very exotic things\n\n1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:58.320\n that degrade its ability to interface nicely\n\n1:28:58.320 --> 1:28:59.840\n with those transistors in the first place.\n\n1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.600\n So that's like one of these things where it's,\n\n1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:05.200\n why is nature dealing us that blow?\n\n1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:07.000\n You give us these beautiful transistors\n\n1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.640\n and you give us all the motivation\n\n1:29:08.640 --> 1:29:10.120\n to use light for communication,\n\n1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:11.520\n but then you don't give us a light source.\n\n1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:14.040\n So, well, okay, you do give us a light source.\n\n1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:15.320\n Compound semiconductors,\n\n1:29:15.320 --> 1:29:16.880\n like we talked about back at the beginning,\n\n1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:19.640\n an element from group three and an element from group five\n\n1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:21.800\n form an alloy where every other lattice site\n\n1:29:21.800 --> 1:29:23.680\n switches which element it is.\n\n1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:27.240\n Those have much better properties for generating light.\n\n1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:30.040\n You put electrons in, light comes out.\n\n1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:33.120\n Almost 100% of the electron hold,\n\n1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:36.080\n it can be made efficient.\n\n1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.440\n I'll take your word for it, okay.\n\n1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:39.600\n However, I say it's physics, not engineering,\n\n1:29:39.600 --> 1:29:41.920\n because it's very difficult\n\n1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:45.240\n to get those compound semiconductor light sources\n\n1:29:45.240 --> 1:29:47.520\n situated with your silicon.\n\n1:29:47.520 --> 1:29:49.400\n In order to do that ion implantation\n\n1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.760\n that I talked about at the beginning,\n\n1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:52.720\n high temperatures are required.\n\n1:29:52.720 --> 1:29:55.680\n So you gotta make all of your transistors first\n\n1:29:55.680 --> 1:29:58.560\n and then put the compound semiconductors on top of there.\n\n1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:00.800\n You can't grow them afterwards\n\n1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:02.360\n because that requires high temperature.\n\n1:30:02.360 --> 1:30:04.000\n It screws up all your transistors.\n\n1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.800\n You try and stick them on there.\n\n1:30:05.800 --> 1:30:07.960\n They don't have the same lattice constant.\n\n1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:10.320\n The spacing between atoms is different enough\n\n1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:11.640\n that it just doesn't work.\n\n1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:15.520\n So nature does not seem to be telling us that,\n\n1:30:15.520 --> 1:30:17.960\n hey, go ahead and combine light sources\n\n1:30:17.960 --> 1:30:19.960\n with your digital switches\n\n1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:22.680\n for conventional digital computing.\n\n1:30:22.680 --> 1:30:24.720\n And conventional digital computing\n\n1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:27.640\n will often require smaller scale, I guess,\n\n1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:29.560\n in terms of like smartphone.\n\n1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:35.440\n So in which kind of systems does nature hint\n\n1:30:35.440 --> 1:30:40.440\n that we can use light and photons for communication?\n\n1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:42.920\n Well, so let me just try and be clear.\n\n1:30:42.920 --> 1:30:46.240\n You can use light for communication in digital systems,\n\n1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:49.640\n just the light sources are not intimately integrated\n\n1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:50.480\n with the silicon.\n\n1:30:50.480 --> 1:30:52.080\n You manufacture all the silicon,\n\n1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:54.680\n you have your microchip, plunk it down.\n\n1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:56.640\n And then you manufacture your light sources,\n\n1:30:56.640 --> 1:30:58.720\n separate chip, completely different process\n\n1:30:58.720 --> 1:31:00.440\n made in a different foundry.\n\n1:31:00.440 --> 1:31:03.200\n And then you put those together at the package level.\n\n1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:06.920\n So now you have some,\n\n1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:09.480\n I would say a great deal of architectural limitations\n\n1:31:09.480 --> 1:31:13.920\n that are introduced by that sort of\n\n1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:15.400\n package level integration\n\n1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:18.000\n as opposed to monolithic on the same chip integration,\n\n1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.600\n but it's still a very useful thing to do.\n\n1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.120\n And that's where I had done some work previously\n\n1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:24.080\n before I came to NIST.\n\n1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:27.920\n There's a project led by Vladimir Stoyanovich\n\n1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:30.800\n that now spun out into a company called IR Labs\n\n1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:33.200\n led by Mark Wade and Chen Sun\n\n1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:34.440\n where they're doing exactly that.\n\n1:31:34.440 --> 1:31:36.440\n So you have your light source chip,\n\n1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:39.760\n your silicon chip, whatever it may be doing,\n\n1:31:39.760 --> 1:31:40.880\n maybe it's digital electronics,\n\n1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:43.600\n maybe it's some other control purpose, something.\n\n1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:47.760\n And the silicon chip drives the light source chip\n\n1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:49.800\n and modulates the intensity of the lights.\n\n1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:52.640\n You can get data out of the package on an optical fiber.\n\n1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:56.560\n And that still gives you tremendous advantages in bandwidth\n\n1:31:56.560 --> 1:31:58.800\n as opposed to sending those signals out\n\n1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:00.760\n over electrical lines.\n\n1:32:00.760 --> 1:32:05.160\n But it is somewhat peculiar to my eye\n\n1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.880\n that they have to be integrated at this package level.\n\n1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:09.760\n And those people, I mean, they're so smart.\n\n1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:12.880\n Those are my colleagues that I respect a great deal.\n\n1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:15.520\n So it's very clear that it's not just\n\n1:32:16.760 --> 1:32:18.760\n they're making a bad choice.\n\n1:32:18.760 --> 1:32:20.480\n This is what physics is telling us.\n\n1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:22.280\n It just wouldn't make any sense\n\n1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.240\n to try to stick them together.\n\n1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:26.520\n Yeah, so even if it's difficult,\n\n1:32:28.160 --> 1:32:30.880\n it's easier than the alternative, unfortunately.\n\n1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:31.720\n I think so, yes.\n\n1:32:31.720 --> 1:32:33.280\n And again, I need to go back\n\n1:32:33.280 --> 1:32:35.080\n and make sure that I'm not taking the wrong way.\n\n1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:36.800\n I'm not saying that the pursuit\n\n1:32:36.800 --> 1:32:39.400\n of integrating compound semiconductors with silicon\n\n1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:41.120\n is fruitless and shouldn't be pursued.\n\n1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.440\n It should, and people are doing great work.\n\n1:32:43.440 --> 1:32:45.720\n Kai Mei Lau and John Bowers, others,\n\n1:32:45.720 --> 1:32:48.240\n they're doing it and they're making progress.\n\n1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:52.200\n But to my eye, it doesn't look like that's ever going to be\n\n1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:57.720\n just the standard monolithic light source\n\n1:32:57.720 --> 1:32:58.600\n on silicon process.\n\n1:32:58.600 --> 1:33:00.040\n I just don't see it.\n\n1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:02.840\n Yeah, so nature kind of points the way usually.\n\n1:33:02.840 --> 1:33:04.480\n And if you resist nature,\n\n1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:05.680\n you're gonna have to do a lot more work.\n\n1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:07.720\n And it's gonna be expensive and not scalable.\n\n1:33:07.720 --> 1:33:08.560\n Got it.\n\n1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:11.320\n But okay, so let's go far into the future.\n\n1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:14.760\n Let's imagine this gigantic neuromorphic computing system\n\n1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:17.360\n that simulates all of our realities.\n\n1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:19.080\n It currently is Mantra Matrix 4.\n\n1:33:19.080 --> 1:33:23.200\n So this thing, this powerful computer,\n\n1:33:23.200 --> 1:33:24.880\n how does it operate?\n\n1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:27.520\n So what are the neurons?\n\n1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:29.040\n What is the communication?\n\n1:33:29.040 --> 1:33:30.000\n What's your sense?\n\n1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.480\n All right, so let me now,\n\n1:33:32.480 --> 1:33:34.720\n after spending 45 minutes trashing\n\n1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:36.160\n light source integration with silicon,\n\n1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:40.160\n let me now say why I'm basing my entire life,\n\n1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:43.680\n professional life, on integrating light sources\n\n1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:44.960\n with electronics.\n\n1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:47.040\n I think the game is completely different\n\n1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:49.560\n when you're talking about superconducting electronics.\n\n1:33:49.560 --> 1:33:54.240\n For several reasons, let me try to go through them.\n\n1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:56.480\n One is that, as I mentioned,\n\n1:33:56.480 --> 1:33:57.960\n it's difficult to integrate\n\n1:33:57.960 --> 1:34:01.280\n those compound semiconductor light sources with silicon.\n\n1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:04.800\n With silicon is a requirement that is introduced\n\n1:34:04.800 --> 1:34:07.280\n by the fact that you're using semiconducting electronics.\n\n1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:08.840\n In superconducting electronics,\n\n1:34:08.840 --> 1:34:10.840\n you're still gonna start with a silicon wafer,\n\n1:34:10.840 --> 1:34:13.880\n but it's just the bread for your sandwich in a lot of ways.\n\n1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:15.800\n You're not using that silicon\n\n1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.720\n in precisely the same way for the electronics.\n\n1:34:17.720 --> 1:34:20.440\n You're now depositing superconducting materials\n\n1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:21.840\n on top of that.\n\n1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:24.520\n The prospects for integrating light sources\n\n1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:27.400\n with that kind of an electronic process\n\n1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.480\n are certainly less explored,\n\n1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:31.960\n but I think much more promising\n\n1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:34.280\n because you don't need those light sources\n\n1:34:34.280 --> 1:34:36.600\n to be intimately integrated with the transistors.\n\n1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:37.920\n That's where the problems come up.\n\n1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:39.920\n They don't need to be lattice matched to the silicon,\n\n1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.160\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.640\n Instead, it seems possible\n\n1:34:43.640 --> 1:34:47.320\n that you can take those compound semiconductor light sources,\n\n1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:49.160\n stick them on the silicon wafer,\n\n1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:51.400\n and then grow your superconducting electronics\n\n1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:52.320\n on the top of that.\n\n1:34:52.320 --> 1:34:55.800\n It's at least not obviously going to fail.\n\n1:34:55.800 --> 1:34:57.280\n So the computation would be done\n\n1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:00.120\n on the superconductive material as well?\n\n1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:01.920\n Yes, the computation is done\n\n1:35:01.920 --> 1:35:03.920\n in the superconducting electronics,\n\n1:35:03.920 --> 1:35:06.400\n and the light sources receive signals\n\n1:35:06.400 --> 1:35:08.200\n that say, hey, a neuron reached threshold,\n\n1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:09.800\n produce a pulse of light,\n\n1:35:09.800 --> 1:35:12.480\n send it out to all your downstream synaptic connections.\n\n1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:16.240\n Those are, again, superconducting electronics.\n\n1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:18.000\n Perform your computation,\n\n1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.640\n and you're off to the races.\n\n1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:20.760\n Your network works.\n\n1:35:20.760 --> 1:35:22.600\n So then if we can rewind real quick,\n\n1:35:22.600 --> 1:35:25.960\n so what are the limitations of the challenges\n\n1:35:25.960 --> 1:35:28.920\n of superconducting electronics\n\n1:35:28.920 --> 1:35:31.480\n when we think about constructing these kinds of systems?\n\n1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:35.640\n So actually, let me say one other thing\n\n1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:37.560\n about the light sources,\n\n1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:39.840\n and then I'll move on, I promise,\n\n1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:42.320\n because this is probably tedious for some.\n\n1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:44.000\n This is super exciting.\n\n1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:45.720\n Okay, one other thing about the light sources.\n\n1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:48.920\n I said that silicon is terrible at emitting photons.\n\n1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:50.640\n It's just not what it's meant to do.\n\n1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:52.800\n However, the game is different\n\n1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:54.080\n when you're at low temperature.\n\n1:35:54.080 --> 1:35:55.720\n If you're working with superconductors,\n\n1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:56.960\n you have to be at low temperature\n\n1:35:56.960 --> 1:35:58.680\n because they don't work otherwise.\n\n1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:00.240\n When you're at four Kelvin,\n\n1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:03.440\n silicon is not obviously a terrible light source.\n\n1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:05.840\n It's still not as efficient as compound semiconductors,\n\n1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:08.680\n but it might be good enough for this application.\n\n1:36:08.680 --> 1:36:11.320\n The final thing that I'll mention about that is, again,\n\n1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:13.960\n leveraging superconductors, as I said,\n\n1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:15.360\n in a different context,\n\n1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:19.520\n superconducting detectors can receive one single photon.\n\n1:36:19.520 --> 1:36:21.240\n In that conversation, I failed to mention\n\n1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:23.480\n that semiconductors can also receive photons.\n\n1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.200\n That's the primary mechanism by which it's done.\n\n1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:29.400\n A camera in your phone that's receptive to visible light\n\n1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:31.080\n is receiving photons.\n\n1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:32.200\n It's based on silicon,\n\n1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.360\n or you can make it in different semiconductors\n\n1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:36.600\n for different wavelengths,\n\n1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:39.600\n but it requires on the order of a thousand,\n\n1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:43.560\n a few thousand photons to receive a pulse.\n\n1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:46.160\n Now, when you're using a superconducting detector,\n\n1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:48.360\n you need one photon, exactly one.\n\n1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:50.840\n I mean, one or more.\n\n1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:54.840\n So the fact that your synapses can now be based\n\n1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:56.680\n on superconducting detectors\n\n1:36:56.680 --> 1:36:58.800\n instead of semiconducting detectors\n\n1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:00.720\n brings the light levels that are required\n\n1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:03.160\n down by some three orders of magnitude.\n\n1:37:03.160 --> 1:37:06.520\n So now you don't need good light sources.\n\n1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:08.800\n You can have the world's worst light sources.\n\n1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:11.840\n As long as they spit out maybe a few thousand photons\n\n1:37:11.840 --> 1:37:13.800\n every time a neuron fires,\n\n1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:17.640\n you have the hardware principles in place\n\n1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:19.640\n that you might be able to perform\n\n1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:21.720\n this optoelectronic integration.\n\n1:37:21.720 --> 1:37:25.040\n To me optoelectronic integration is, it's just so enticing.\n\n1:37:25.040 --> 1:37:28.680\n We want to be able to leverage electronics for computation,\n\n1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:30.400\n light for communication,\n\n1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:32.800\n working with silicon microelectronics at room temperature\n\n1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.000\n that has been exceedingly difficult.\n\n1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:40.000\n And I hope that when we move to the superconducting domain,\n\n1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:41.840\n target a different application space\n\n1:37:41.840 --> 1:37:44.920\n that is neuromorphic instead of digital\n\n1:37:44.920 --> 1:37:47.680\n and use superconducting detectors,\n\n1:37:47.680 --> 1:37:50.120\n maybe optoelectronic integration comes to us.\n\n1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:51.720\n Okay, so there's a bunch of questions.\n\n1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:53.680\n So one is temperature.\n\n1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:58.320\n So in these kinds of hybrid heterogeneous systems,\n\n1:37:58.320 --> 1:37:59.560\n what's the temperature?\n\n1:37:59.560 --> 1:38:01.600\n What are some of the constraints to the operation here?\n\n1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:03.560\n Does it all have to be a four Kelvin as well?\n\n1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:04.400\n Four Kelvin.\n\n1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:06.840\n Everything has to be at four Kelvin.\n\n1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:09.720\n Okay, so what are the other engineering challenges\n\n1:38:09.720 --> 1:38:14.320\n of making this kind of optoelectronic systems?\n\n1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:16.720\n Let me just dwell on that four Kelvin for a second\n\n1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:18.280\n because some people hear four Kelvin\n\n1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:19.280\n and they just get up and leave.\n\n1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:21.480\n They just say, I'm not doing it, you know?\n\n1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:25.360\n And to me, that's very earth centric, species centric.\n\n1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:27.240\n We live in 300 Kelvin.\n\n1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:29.120\n So we want our technologies to operate there too.\n\n1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:30.080\n I totally get it.\n\n1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:31.880\n Yeah, what's zero Celsius?\n\n1:38:31.880 --> 1:38:34.520\n Zero Celsius is 273 Kelvin.\n\n1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:37.640\n So we're talking very, very cold here.\n\n1:38:37.640 --> 1:38:38.480\n This is...\n\n1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:39.400\n Not even Boston cold.\n\n1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:40.240\n No.\n\n1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:42.400\n This is real cold.\n\n1:38:42.400 --> 1:38:43.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:44.280\n Siberia cold, no.\n\n1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:45.680\n Okay, so just for reference,\n\n1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:47.920\n the temperature of the cosmic microwave background\n\n1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.400\n is about 2.7 Kelvin.\n\n1:38:49.400 --> 1:38:51.680\n So we're still warmer than deep space.\n\n1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:52.960\n Yeah, good.\n\n1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:56.520\n So that when the universe dies out,\n\n1:38:56.520 --> 1:38:57.920\n it'll be colder than four K.\n\n1:38:57.920 --> 1:38:59.400\n It's already colder than four K.\n\n1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:01.760\n In the expanses, you know,\n\n1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:05.000\n you don't have to get that far away from the earth\n\n1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.040\n in order to drop down to not far from four Kelvin.\n\n1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:11.200\n So what you're saying is the aliens that live at the edge\n\n1:39:11.200 --> 1:39:13.280\n of the observable universe\n\n1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:16.440\n are using superconductive material for their computation.\n\n1:39:16.440 --> 1:39:17.880\n They don't have to live at the edge of the universe.\n\n1:39:17.880 --> 1:39:21.040\n The aliens that are more advanced than us\n\n1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:24.480\n in their solar system are doing this\n\n1:39:24.480 --> 1:39:26.560\n in their asteroid belt.\n\n1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:27.800\n We can get to that.\n\n1:39:27.800 --> 1:39:30.320\n Oh, because they can get that\n\n1:39:30.320 --> 1:39:31.640\n to that temperature easier there?\n\n1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:32.480\n Sure, yeah.\n\n1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:34.120\n All you have to do is reflect the sunlight away\n\n1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:36.080\n and you have a huge headstart.\n\n1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:37.680\n Oh, so the sun is the problem here.\n\n1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:39.000\n Like it's warm here on earth.\n\n1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:39.840\n Got it. Yeah.\n\n1:39:39.840 --> 1:39:41.560\n Okay, so can you...\n\n1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:42.920\n So how do we get to four K?\n\n1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:43.760\n What's...\n\n1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:47.320\n Well, okay, so what I want to say about temperature...\n\n1:39:47.320 --> 1:39:48.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:50.640\n What I want to say about temperature is that\n\n1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:52.600\n if you can swallow that,\n\n1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:56.200\n if you can say, all right, I give up applications\n\n1:39:56.200 --> 1:39:58.200\n that have to do with my cell phone\n\n1:39:58.200 --> 1:40:02.040\n and the convenience of a laptop on a train\n\n1:40:02.040 --> 1:40:03.760\n and you instead...\n\n1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:06.440\n For me, I'm very much in the scientific head space.\n\n1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:07.960\n I'm not looking at products.\n\n1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:09.880\n I'm not looking at what this will be useful\n\n1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:11.000\n to sell to consumers.\n\n1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.400\n Instead, I'm thinking about scientific questions.\n\n1:40:13.400 --> 1:40:16.560\n Well, it's just not that bad to have to work at four Kelvin.\n\n1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:19.000\n We do it all the time in our labs at NIST.\n\n1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:19.840\n And so does...\n\n1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:21.440\n I mean, for reference,\n\n1:40:21.440 --> 1:40:25.560\n the entire quantum computing sector\n\n1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:28.680\n usually has to work at something like 100 millikelvin,\n\n1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:29.680\n 50 millikelvin.\n\n1:40:29.680 --> 1:40:32.120\n So now you're talking of another factor of 100\n\n1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:35.160\n even colder than that, a fraction of a degree.\n\n1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:37.360\n And everybody seems to think quantum computing\n\n1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:39.200\n is going to take over the world.\n\n1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:40.720\n It's so much more expensive\n\n1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:46.600\n to have to get that extra factor of 10 or whatever colder.\n\n1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:50.280\n And yet it's not stopping people from investing in that area.\n\n1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:53.840\n And by investing, I mean putting their research into it\n\n1:40:53.840 --> 1:40:55.760\n as well as venture capital or whatever.\n\n1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:56.600\n So...\n\n1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.600\n Oh, so based on the energy of what you're commenting on,\n\n1:40:59.600 --> 1:41:01.960\n I'm getting a sense that's one of the criticism\n\n1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:06.720\n of this approach is 4K, 4 Kelvin is a big negative.\n\n1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:10.680\n It is the showstopper for a lot of people.\n\n1:41:10.680 --> 1:41:12.880\n They just, I mean, and understandably,\n\n1:41:12.880 --> 1:41:16.840\n I'm not saying that that's not a consideration.\n\n1:41:16.840 --> 1:41:17.840\n Of course it is.\n\n1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:18.800\n For some...\n\n1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:21.440\n Okay, so different motivations for different people.\n\n1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:23.000\n In the academic world,\n\n1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.400\n suppose you spent your whole life\n\n1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:26.760\n learning about silicon microelectronic circuits.\n\n1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:28.880\n You send a design to a foundry,\n\n1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:30.520\n they send you back a chip\n\n1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:33.000\n and you go test it at your tabletop.\n\n1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:34.360\n And now I'm saying,\n\n1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.520\n here now learn how to use all these cryogenics\n\n1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:38.440\n so you can do that at 4 Kelvin.\n\n1:41:38.440 --> 1:41:39.880\n No, come on, man.\n\n1:41:39.880 --> 1:41:41.200\n I don't wanna do that.\n\n1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:42.040\n That sounds bad.\n\n1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:44.520\n It's the old momentum, the Titanic of the turning.\n\n1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:45.600\n Yeah, kind of.\n\n1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:48.360\n But you're saying that's not too much of a...\n\n1:41:48.360 --> 1:41:50.360\n When we're looking at large systems\n\n1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.320\n and the gain you can potentially get from them,\n\n1:41:52.320 --> 1:41:53.440\n that's not that much of a cost.\n\n1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:55.160\n And when you wanna answer the scientific question\n\n1:41:55.160 --> 1:41:58.120\n about what are the physical limits of cognition?\n\n1:41:58.120 --> 1:41:59.800\n Well, the physical limits,\n\n1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.440\n they don't care if you're at 4 Kelvin.\n\n1:42:01.440 --> 1:42:04.560\n If you can perform cognition at a scale\n\n1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:07.680\n orders of magnitude beyond any room temperature technology,\n\n1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:09.760\n but you gotta get cold to do it,\n\n1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:10.600\n you're gonna do it.\n\n1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:14.600\n And to me, that's the interesting application space.\n\n1:42:14.600 --> 1:42:16.120\n It's not even an application space,\n\n1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:18.920\n that's the interesting scientific paradigm.\n\n1:42:18.920 --> 1:42:22.560\n So I personally am not going to let low temperature\n\n1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.560\n stop me from realizing a technological domain or realm\n\n1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.800\n that is achieving in most ways everything else\n\n1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:36.160\n that I'm looking for in my hardware.\n\n1:42:36.160 --> 1:42:37.640\n So that, okay, that's a big one.\n\n1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:40.000\n Is there other kind of engineering challenges\n\n1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:40.840\n that you envision?\n\n1:42:40.840 --> 1:42:41.680\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:43.120\n So let me take a moment here\n\n1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:45.760\n because I haven't really described what I mean\n\n1:42:45.760 --> 1:42:49.000\n by a neuron or a network in this particular hardware.\n\n1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.640\n Yeah, do you wanna talk about loop neurons\n\n1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:53.680\n and there's so many fascinating...\n\n1:42:53.680 --> 1:42:55.960\n But you just have so many amazing papers\n\n1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:57.720\n that people should definitely check out\n\n1:42:57.720 --> 1:42:59.880\n and the titles alone are just killer.\n\n1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:01.080\n So anyway, go ahead.\n\n1:43:01.080 --> 1:43:03.680\n Right, so let me say big picture,\n\n1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:07.720\n based on optics, photonics for communication,\n\n1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:10.120\n superconducting electronics for computation,\n\n1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:11.520\n how does this all work?\n\n1:43:11.520 --> 1:43:16.520\n So a neuron in this hardware platform\n\n1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:19.520\n can be thought of as circuits\n\n1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:21.080\n that are based on Josephson junctions,\n\n1:43:21.080 --> 1:43:22.680\n like we talked about before,\n\n1:43:22.680 --> 1:43:25.320\n where every time a photon comes in...\n\n1:43:25.320 --> 1:43:27.120\n So let's start by talking about a synapse.\n\n1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:29.680\n A synapse receives a photon, one or more,\n\n1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:31.400\n from a different neuron\n\n1:43:31.400 --> 1:43:33.600\n and it converts that optical signal\n\n1:43:33.600 --> 1:43:35.320\n to an electrical signal.\n\n1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:38.920\n The amount of current that that adds to a loop\n\n1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:40.840\n is controlled by the synaptic weight.\n\n1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:42.360\n So as I said before,\n\n1:43:42.360 --> 1:43:44.520\n you're popping fluxons into a loop, right?\n\n1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:46.440\n So a photon comes in,\n\n1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:49.200\n it hits a superconducting single photon detector,\n\n1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:52.120\n one photon, the absolute physical minimum\n\n1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:53.040\n that you can communicate\n\n1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:54.520\n from one place to another with light.\n\n1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:56.120\n And that detector then converts that\n\n1:43:56.120 --> 1:43:57.360\n into an electrical signal\n\n1:43:57.360 --> 1:43:58.720\n and the amount of signal\n\n1:43:58.720 --> 1:44:01.200\n is correlated with some kind of weight.\n\n1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:02.940\n Yeah, so the synaptic weight will tell you\n\n1:44:02.940 --> 1:44:05.440\n how many fluxons you pop into the loop.\n\n1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:06.560\n It's an analog number.\n\n1:44:06.560 --> 1:44:08.160\n We're doing analog computation now.\n\n1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:09.760\n Well, can you just linger on that?\n\n1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:10.980\n What the heck is a fluxon?\n\n1:44:10.980 --> 1:44:11.960\n Are we supposed to know this?\n\n1:44:11.960 --> 1:44:14.220\n Or is this a funny,\n\n1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:15.600\n is this like the big bang?\n\n1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:18.840\n Is this a funny word for something deeply technical?\n\n1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:21.040\n No, let's try to avoid using the word fluxon\n\n1:44:21.040 --> 1:44:22.960\n because it's not actually necessary.\n\n1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:24.360\n When a photon...\n\n1:44:24.360 --> 1:44:25.440\n It's fun to say though.\n\n1:44:25.440 --> 1:44:29.400\n So it's very necessary, I would say.\n\n1:44:29.400 --> 1:44:30.360\n When a photon hits\n\n1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:32.920\n that superconducting single photon detector,\n\n1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:36.560\n current is added to a superconducting loop.\n\n1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:39.200\n And the amount of current that you add\n\n1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:40.340\n is an analog value,\n\n1:44:40.340 --> 1:44:42.980\n can have eight bit equivalent resolution,\n\n1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:44.240\n something like that.\n\n1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:45.440\n 10 bits, maybe.\n\n1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:46.920\n That's amazing, by the way.\n\n1:44:46.920 --> 1:44:48.480\n This is starting to make a lot more sense.\n\n1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:50.620\n When you're using superconductors for this,\n\n1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.720\n the energy of that circulating current\n\n1:44:54.720 --> 1:44:58.600\n is less than the energy of that photon.\n\n1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:01.760\n So your energy budget is not destroyed\n\n1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:04.000\n by doing this analog computation.\n\n1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:07.080\n So now in the language of a neuroscientist,\n\n1:45:07.080 --> 1:45:09.180\n you would say that's your postsynaptic signal.\n\n1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:11.680\n You have this current being stored in a loop.\n\n1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:13.480\n You can decide what you wanna do with it.\n\n1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:16.160\n Most likely you're gonna have it decay exponentially.\n\n1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:18.280\n So every single synapse\n\n1:45:18.280 --> 1:45:20.960\n is gonna have some given time constant.\n\n1:45:20.960 --> 1:45:25.360\n And that's determined by putting some resistor\n\n1:45:25.360 --> 1:45:27.040\n in that superconducting loop.\n\n1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:31.120\n So a synapse event occurs when a photon strikes a detector,\n\n1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:33.880\n adds current to that loop, it decays over time.\n\n1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:35.560\n That's the postsynaptic signal.\n\n1:45:35.560 --> 1:45:38.440\n Then you can process that in a dendritic tree.\n\n1:45:38.440 --> 1:45:41.080\n Bryce Primavera and I have a paper\n\n1:45:41.080 --> 1:45:43.420\n that we've submitted about that.\n\n1:45:43.420 --> 1:45:45.380\n For the more neuroscience oriented people,\n\n1:45:45.380 --> 1:45:47.080\n there's a lot of dendritic processing,\n\n1:45:47.080 --> 1:45:49.440\n a lot of plasticity mechanisms you can implement\n\n1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:51.480\n with essentially exactly the same circuits.\n\n1:45:51.480 --> 1:45:54.460\n You have this one simple building block circuit\n\n1:45:54.460 --> 1:45:57.240\n that you can use for a synapse, for a dendrite,\n\n1:45:57.240 --> 1:46:00.320\n for the neuron cell body, for all the plasticity functions.\n\n1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:02.360\n It's all based on the same building block,\n\n1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:03.760\n just tweaking a couple parameters.\n\n1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:05.040\n So this basic building block\n\n1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:07.240\n has both an optical and an electrical component,\n\n1:46:07.240 --> 1:46:11.680\n and then you just build arbitrary large systems with that?\n\n1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:13.520\n Close, you're not at fault\n\n1:46:13.520 --> 1:46:15.000\n for thinking that that's what I meant.\n\n1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:18.780\n What I should say is that if you want it to be a synapse,\n\n1:46:18.780 --> 1:46:22.240\n you tack a superconducting detector onto the front of it.\n\n1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:23.440\n And if you want it to be anything else,\n\n1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:25.280\n there's no optical component.\n\n1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:26.820\n Got it, so at the front,\n\n1:46:28.400 --> 1:46:32.160\n optics in the front, electrical stuff in the back.\n\n1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:34.120\n Electrical, yeah, in the processing\n\n1:46:34.120 --> 1:46:36.480\n and in the output signal that it sends\n\n1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:39.380\n to the next stage of processing further.\n\n1:46:39.380 --> 1:46:41.480\n So the dendritic trees is electrical.\n\n1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:42.500\n It's all electrical.\n\n1:46:42.500 --> 1:46:44.880\n It's all electrical in the superconducting domain.\n\n1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:48.560\n For anybody who's up on their superconducting circuits,\n\n1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:52.440\n it's just based on a DC squid, the most ubiquitous,\n\n1:46:52.440 --> 1:46:55.160\n which is a circuit composed of two Joseph's injunctions.\n\n1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:58.720\n So it's a very bread and butter kind of thing.\n\n1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:00.900\n And then the only place where you go beyond that\n\n1:47:00.900 --> 1:47:03.040\n is the neuron cell body itself.\n\n1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:05.300\n It's receiving all these electrical inputs\n\n1:47:05.300 --> 1:47:06.840\n from the synapses or dendrites\n\n1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:09.840\n or however you've structured that particular unique neuron.\n\n1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:12.320\n And when it reaches its threshold,\n\n1:47:12.320 --> 1:47:14.360\n which occurs by driving a Joseph's injunction\n\n1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:15.760\n above its critical current,\n\n1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:17.200\n it produces a pulse of current,\n\n1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:19.460\n which starts an amplification sequence,\n\n1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:21.380\n voltage amplification,\n\n1:47:21.380 --> 1:47:24.480\n that produces light out of a transmitter.\n\n1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:26.880\n So one of our colleagues, Adam McCann,\n\n1:47:26.880 --> 1:47:27.960\n and Sonia Buckley as well,\n\n1:47:27.960 --> 1:47:30.980\n did a lot of work on the light sources\n\n1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:34.660\n and the amplifiers that drive the current\n\n1:47:34.660 --> 1:47:37.560\n and produce sufficient voltage to drive current\n\n1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:39.160\n through that now semiconducting part.\n\n1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:43.160\n So that light source is the semiconducting part of a neuron.\n\n1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:45.620\n And that, so the neuron has reached threshold.\n\n1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:47.640\n It produces a pulse of light.\n\n1:47:47.640 --> 1:47:51.560\n That light then fans out across a network of wave guides\n\n1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.520\n to reach all the downstream synaptic terminals\n\n1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:57.320\n that perform this process themselves.\n\n1:47:57.320 --> 1:47:59.880\n So it's probably worth explaining\n\n1:47:59.880 --> 1:48:02.320\n what a network of wave guides is,\n\n1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:04.780\n because a lot of listeners aren't gonna know that.\n\n1:48:04.780 --> 1:48:07.120\n Look up the papers by Jeff Chiles on this one.\n\n1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:11.380\n But basically, light can be guided in a simple,\n\n1:48:11.380 --> 1:48:14.880\n basically wire of usually an insulating material.\n\n1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:18.280\n So silicon, silicon nitride,\n\n1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:20.040\n different kinds of glass,\n\n1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.440\n just like in a fiber optic, it's glass, silicon dioxide.\n\n1:48:23.440 --> 1:48:24.840\n That makes it a little bit big.\n\n1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.160\n We wanna bring these down.\n\n1:48:26.160 --> 1:48:28.040\n So we use different materials like silicon nitride,\n\n1:48:28.040 --> 1:48:32.980\n but basically just imagine a rectangle of some material\n\n1:48:32.980 --> 1:48:35.560\n that just goes and branches,\n\n1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.980\n forms different branch points\n\n1:48:39.980 --> 1:48:43.060\n that target different subregions of the network.\n\n1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:45.000\n You can transition between layers of these.\n\n1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.160\n So now we're talking about building in the third dimension,\n\n1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:48.840\n which is absolutely crucial.\n\n1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.720\n So that's what wave guides are.\n\n1:48:50.720 --> 1:48:52.040\n Yeah, that's great.\n\n1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:54.680\n Why the third dimension is crucial?\n\n1:48:54.680 --> 1:48:56.640\n Okay, so yes, you were talking about\n\n1:48:56.640 --> 1:48:58.760\n what are some of the technical limitations.\n\n1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:04.280\n One of the things that I believe we have to grapple with\n\n1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:08.800\n is that our brains are miraculously compact.\n\n1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:11.560\n For the number of neurons that are in our brain,\n\n1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:13.520\n it sure does fit in a small volume,\n\n1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:16.200\n as it would have to if we're gonna be biological organisms\n\n1:49:16.200 --> 1:49:19.260\n that are resource limited and things like that.\n\n1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:20.960\n Any kind of hardware neuron\n\n1:49:20.960 --> 1:49:23.460\n is almost certainly gonna be much bigger than that\n\n1:49:23.460 --> 1:49:26.480\n if it is of comparable complexity,\n\n1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:28.540\n whether it's based on silicon transistors.\n\n1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:30.720\n Okay, a transistor, seven nanometers,\n\n1:49:30.720 --> 1:49:33.760\n that doesn't mean a semiconductor based neuron\n\n1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:34.680\n is seven nanometers.\n\n1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:35.920\n They're big.\n\n1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:38.780\n They require many transistors,\n\n1:49:38.780 --> 1:49:40.640\n different other things like capacitors and things\n\n1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:41.540\n that store charge.\n\n1:49:41.540 --> 1:49:44.660\n They end up being on the order of 100 microns\n\n1:49:44.660 --> 1:49:45.880\n by 100 microns,\n\n1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:48.240\n and it's difficult to get them down any smaller than that.\n\n1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:50.600\n The same is true for superconducting neurons,\n\n1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:52.080\n and the same is true\n\n1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:54.000\n if we're trying to use light for communication.\n\n1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.860\n Even if you're using electrons for communication,\n\n1:49:56.860 --> 1:50:00.680\n you have these wires where, okay,\n\n1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:03.360\n the size of an electron might be angstroms,\n\n1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:05.560\n but the size of a wire is not angstroms,\n\n1:50:05.560 --> 1:50:07.160\n and if you try and make it narrower,\n\n1:50:07.160 --> 1:50:08.520\n the resistance just goes up,\n\n1:50:08.520 --> 1:50:10.760\n so you don't actually win.\n\n1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:12.360\n To communicate over long distances,\n\n1:50:12.360 --> 1:50:15.640\n you need your wires to be microns wide,\n\n1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.160\n and it's the same thing for wave guides.\n\n1:50:17.160 --> 1:50:18.920\n Wave guides are essentially limited\n\n1:50:18.920 --> 1:50:20.280\n by the wavelength of light,\n\n1:50:20.280 --> 1:50:21.920\n and that's gonna be about a micron,\n\n1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:24.680\n so whereas compare that to an axon,\n\n1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:26.760\n the analogous component in the brain,\n\n1:50:26.760 --> 1:50:31.100\n which is 10 nanometers in diameter, something like that,\n\n1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:33.680\n they're bigger when they need to communicate\n\n1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:34.640\n over long distances,\n\n1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:37.960\n but grappling with the size of these structures\n\n1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.820\n is inevitable and crucial,\n\n1:50:39.820 --> 1:50:44.820\n and so in order to make systems of comparable scale\n\n1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:46.880\n to the human brain, by scale here,\n\n1:50:46.880 --> 1:50:49.840\n I mean number of interconnected neurons,\n\n1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.760\n you absolutely have to be using\n\n1:50:51.760 --> 1:50:53.640\n the third spatial dimension,\n\n1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:55.960\n and that means on the wafer,\n\n1:50:55.960 --> 1:50:57.360\n you need multiple layers\n\n1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:59.600\n of both active and passive components.\n\n1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:03.360\n Active, I mean superconducting electronic circuits\n\n1:51:03.360 --> 1:51:05.360\n that are performing computations,\n\n1:51:05.360 --> 1:51:07.400\n and passive, I mean these wave guides\n\n1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:10.140\n that are routing the optical signals to different places,\n\n1:51:10.140 --> 1:51:11.720\n you have to be able to stack those.\n\n1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:14.720\n If you can get to something like 10 planes\n\n1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.160\n of each of those, or maybe not even 10,\n\n1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:18.840\n maybe five, six, something like that,\n\n1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:19.760\n then you're in business.\n\n1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:22.860\n Now you can get millions of neurons on a wafer,\n\n1:51:22.860 --> 1:51:26.380\n but that's not anywhere close to the brain scale.\n\n1:51:26.380 --> 1:51:27.960\n In order to get to the scale of the human brain,\n\n1:51:27.960 --> 1:51:30.000\n you're gonna have to also use the third dimension\n\n1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.560\n in the sense that entire wafers\n\n1:51:32.560 --> 1:51:34.160\n need to be stacked on top of each other\n\n1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:36.080\n with fiber optic communication between them,\n\n1:51:36.080 --> 1:51:38.640\n and we need to be able to fill a space\n\n1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:42.040\n the size of this table with stacked wafers,\n\n1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:44.280\n and that's when you can get to some 10 billion neurons\n\n1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:45.120\n like your human brain,\n\n1:51:45.120 --> 1:51:46.680\n and I don't think that's specific\n\n1:51:46.680 --> 1:51:48.800\n to the optoelectronic approach that we're taking.\n\n1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:51.400\n I think that applies to any hardware\n\n1:51:51.400 --> 1:51:53.560\n where you're trying to reach commensurate scale\n\n1:51:53.560 --> 1:51:55.000\n and complexity as the human brain.\n\n1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.520\n So you need that fractal stacking,\n\n1:51:57.520 --> 1:51:59.360\n so stacking on the wafer,\n\n1:51:59.360 --> 1:52:01.120\n and stacking of the wafers,\n\n1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:03.840\n and then whatever the system that combines,\n\n1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:06.360\n this stacking of the tables with the wafers.\n\n1:52:06.360 --> 1:52:07.720\n And it has to be fractal all the way,\n\n1:52:07.720 --> 1:52:08.600\n you're exactly right,\n\n1:52:08.600 --> 1:52:10.060\n because that's the only way\n\n1:52:10.060 --> 1:52:12.500\n that you can efficiently get information\n\n1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:15.060\n from a small point to across that whole network.\n\n1:52:15.060 --> 1:52:17.520\n It has to have the power law connected.\n\n1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:20.640\n And photons are like optics throughout.\n\n1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:21.480\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:52:21.480 --> 1:52:23.680\n Once you're at this scale, to me it's just obvious.\n\n1:52:23.680 --> 1:52:25.580\n Of course you're using light for communication.\n\n1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:30.580\n You have fiber optics given to us from nature, so simple.\n\n1:52:30.580 --> 1:52:32.860\n The thought of even trying to do\n\n1:52:32.860 --> 1:52:34.740\n any kind of electrical communication\n\n1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:37.140\n just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n1:52:37.140 --> 1:52:39.260\n I'm not saying it's wrong, I don't know,\n\n1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:40.980\n but that's where I'm coming from.\n\n1:52:40.980 --> 1:52:43.860\n So let's return to loop neurons.\n\n1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:46.460\n Why are they called loop neurons?\n\n1:52:46.460 --> 1:52:48.900\n Yeah, the term loop neurons comes from the fact,\n\n1:52:48.900 --> 1:52:49.980\n like we've been talking about,\n\n1:52:49.980 --> 1:52:53.260\n that they rely heavily on these superconducting loops.\n\n1:52:53.260 --> 1:52:57.420\n So even in a lot of forms of digital computing\n\n1:52:57.420 --> 1:52:58.740\n with superconductors,\n\n1:52:58.740 --> 1:53:02.540\n storing a signal in a superconducting loop\n\n1:53:02.540 --> 1:53:05.060\n is a primary technique.\n\n1:53:05.060 --> 1:53:06.660\n In this particular case,\n\n1:53:06.660 --> 1:53:08.620\n it's just loops everywhere you look.\n\n1:53:08.620 --> 1:53:11.620\n So the strength of a synaptic weight\n\n1:53:11.620 --> 1:53:15.060\n is gonna be set by the amount of current circulating\n\n1:53:15.060 --> 1:53:17.820\n in a loop that is coupled to the synapse.\n\n1:53:17.820 --> 1:53:22.820\n So memory is implemented as current circulating\n\n1:53:22.820 --> 1:53:24.140\n in a superconducting loop.\n\n1:53:24.140 --> 1:53:27.140\n The coupling between, say, a synapse and a dendrite\n\n1:53:27.140 --> 1:53:29.260\n or a synapse in the neuron cell body\n\n1:53:29.260 --> 1:53:33.140\n occurs through loop coupling through transformers.\n\n1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:34.820\n So current circulating in a synapse\n\n1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:37.580\n is gonna induce current in a different loop,\n\n1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:40.820\n a receiving loop in the neuron cell body.\n\n1:53:40.820 --> 1:53:44.500\n So since all of the computation is happening\n\n1:53:44.500 --> 1:53:46.660\n in these flux storage loops\n\n1:53:46.660 --> 1:53:48.380\n and they play such a central role\n\n1:53:48.380 --> 1:53:50.260\n in how the information is processed,\n\n1:53:50.260 --> 1:53:52.820\n how memories are formed, all that stuff,\n\n1:53:52.820 --> 1:53:53.980\n I didn't think too much about it,\n\n1:53:53.980 --> 1:53:55.540\n I just called them loop neurons\n\n1:53:55.540 --> 1:53:58.180\n because it rolls off the tongue a little bit better\n\n1:53:58.180 --> 1:54:01.220\n than superconducting optoelectronic neurons.\n\n1:54:02.220 --> 1:54:07.220\n Okay, so how do you design circuits for these loop neurons?\n\n1:54:08.540 --> 1:54:09.740\n That's a great question.\n\n1:54:09.740 --> 1:54:12.340\n There's a lot of different scales of design.\n\n1:54:12.340 --> 1:54:16.340\n So at the level of just one synapse,\n\n1:54:16.340 --> 1:54:18.980\n you can use conventional methods.\n\n1:54:18.980 --> 1:54:21.100\n They're not that complicated\n\n1:54:21.100 --> 1:54:23.220\n as far as superconducting electronics goes.\n\n1:54:23.220 --> 1:54:27.100\n It's just four Joseph's injunctions or something like that\n\n1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:29.180\n depending on how much complexity you wanna add.\n\n1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:34.180\n So you can just directly simulate each component in SPICE.\n\n1:54:34.940 --> 1:54:35.860\n What's SPICE?\n\n1:54:35.860 --> 1:54:39.220\n It's Standard Electrical Simulation Software, basically.\n\n1:54:39.220 --> 1:54:42.580\n So you're just explicitly solving the differential equations\n\n1:54:42.580 --> 1:54:44.340\n that describe the circuit elements.\n\n1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:46.220\n And then you can stack these things together\n\n1:54:46.220 --> 1:54:48.860\n in that simulation software to then build circuits.\n\n1:54:48.860 --> 1:54:51.580\n You can, but that becomes computationally expensive.\n\n1:54:51.580 --> 1:54:54.100\n So one of the things when COVID hit,\n\n1:54:54.100 --> 1:54:55.780\n we knew we had to turn some attention\n\n1:54:55.780 --> 1:54:59.380\n to more things you can do at home in your basement\n\n1:54:59.380 --> 1:55:02.700\n or whatever, and one of them was computational modeling.\n\n1:55:02.700 --> 1:55:07.700\n So we started working on adapting,\n\n1:55:07.780 --> 1:55:10.180\n abstracting out the circuit performance\n\n1:55:10.180 --> 1:55:12.540\n so that you don't have to explicitly solve\n\n1:55:12.540 --> 1:55:15.860\n the circuit equations, which for Joseph's injunctions\n\n1:55:15.860 --> 1:55:18.460\n usually needs to be done on like a picosecond timescale\n\n1:55:18.460 --> 1:55:21.220\n and you have a lot of nodes in your circuit.\n\n1:55:21.220 --> 1:55:24.860\n So it results in a lot of differential equations\n\n1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.340\n that need to be solved simultaneously.\n\n1:55:26.340 --> 1:55:29.420\n We were looking for a way to simulate these circuits\n\n1:55:29.420 --> 1:55:33.740\n that is scalable up to networks of millions or so neurons\n\n1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:36.620\n is sort of where we're targeting right now.\n\n1:55:36.620 --> 1:55:40.820\n So we were able to analyze the behavior of these circuits.\n\n1:55:40.820 --> 1:55:43.620\n And as I said, it's based on these simple building blocks.\n\n1:55:43.620 --> 1:55:45.140\n So you really only need to understand\n\n1:55:45.140 --> 1:55:46.340\n this one building block.\n\n1:55:46.340 --> 1:55:48.980\n And if you get a good model of that, boom, it tiles.\n\n1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:51.140\n And you can change the parameters in there\n\n1:55:51.140 --> 1:55:52.860\n to get different behaviors and stuff,\n\n1:55:52.860 --> 1:55:56.180\n but it's all based on now it's one differential equation\n\n1:55:56.180 --> 1:55:57.140\n that you need to solve.\n\n1:55:57.140 --> 1:56:00.780\n So one differential equation for every synapse,\n\n1:56:00.780 --> 1:56:03.740\n dendrite or neuron in your system.\n\n1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:05.340\n And for the neuroscientists out there,\n\n1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:08.420\n it's just a simple leaky integrate and fire model,\n\n1:56:08.420 --> 1:56:10.300\n leaky integrator, basically.\n\n1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:11.860\n A synapse is a leaky integrator,\n\n1:56:11.860 --> 1:56:13.460\n a dendrite is a leaky integrator.\n\n1:56:13.460 --> 1:56:18.460\n So I'm really fascinated by how this one simple component\n\n1:56:18.460 --> 1:56:22.180\n can be used to achieve lots of different types\n\n1:56:22.180 --> 1:56:24.420\n of dynamical activity.\n\n1:56:24.420 --> 1:56:27.500\n And to me, that's where scalability comes from.\n\n1:56:27.500 --> 1:56:29.180\n And also complexity as well.\n\n1:56:29.180 --> 1:56:30.860\n Complexity is often characterized\n\n1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:35.420\n by relatively simple building blocks\n\n1:56:35.420 --> 1:56:37.820\n connected in potentially simple\n\n1:56:37.820 --> 1:56:39.340\n or sometimes complicated ways,\n\n1:56:39.340 --> 1:56:41.940\n and then emergent new behavior that was hard to predict\n\n1:56:41.940 --> 1:56:44.660\n from those simple elements.\n\n1:56:44.660 --> 1:56:46.620\n And that's exactly what we're working with here.\n\n1:56:46.620 --> 1:56:49.020\n So it's a very exciting platform,\n\n1:56:49.020 --> 1:56:50.380\n both from a modeling perspective\n\n1:56:50.380 --> 1:56:52.740\n and from a hardware manifestation perspective\n\n1:56:52.740 --> 1:56:57.380\n where we can hopefully start to have this test bed\n\n1:56:57.380 --> 1:56:58.860\n where we can explore things,\n\n1:56:58.860 --> 1:57:00.820\n not just related to neuroscience,\n\n1:57:00.820 --> 1:57:03.300\n but also related to other things\n\n1:57:03.300 --> 1:57:07.140\n that connected to other physics like critical phenomenon,\n\n1:57:07.140 --> 1:57:08.660\n Ising models, things like that.\n\n1:57:08.660 --> 1:57:13.060\n So you were asking how we simulate these circuits.\n\n1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:14.540\n It's at different levels\n\n1:57:14.540 --> 1:57:18.300\n and we've got the simple spice circuit stuff.\n\n1:57:18.300 --> 1:57:19.540\n That's no problem.\n\n1:57:19.540 --> 1:57:21.740\n And now we're building these network models\n\n1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:23.620\n based on this more efficient leaky integrator.\n\n1:57:23.620 --> 1:57:26.220\n So we can actually reduce every element\n\n1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:27.460\n to one differential equation.\n\n1:57:27.460 --> 1:57:28.860\n And then we can also step through it\n\n1:57:28.860 --> 1:57:30.700\n on a much coarser time grid.\n\n1:57:30.700 --> 1:57:32.380\n So it ends up being something like a factor\n\n1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:35.380\n of a thousand to 10,000 speed improvement,\n\n1:57:35.380 --> 1:57:37.740\n which allows us to simulate,\n\n1:57:37.740 --> 1:57:40.540\n but hopefully up to millions of neurons.\n\n1:57:40.540 --> 1:57:44.660\n Whereas before we would have been limited to tens,\n\n1:57:44.660 --> 1:57:45.780\n a hundred, something like that.\n\n1:57:45.780 --> 1:57:48.780\n And just like simulating quantum mechanical systems\n\n1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:49.860\n with a quantum computer.\n\n1:57:49.860 --> 1:57:53.380\n So the goal here is to understand such systems.\n\n1:57:53.380 --> 1:57:55.900\n For me, the goal is to study this\n\n1:57:55.900 --> 1:57:58.940\n as a scientific physical system.\n\n1:57:58.940 --> 1:58:01.940\n I'm not drawn towards turning this\n\n1:58:01.940 --> 1:58:03.460\n into an enterprise at this point.\n\n1:58:03.460 --> 1:58:05.820\n I feel short term applications\n\n1:58:05.820 --> 1:58:07.460\n that obviously make a lot of money\n\n1:58:07.460 --> 1:58:11.380\n is not necessarily a curiosity driver for you at the moment.\n\n1:58:11.380 --> 1:58:12.220\n Absolutely not.\n\n1:58:12.220 --> 1:58:14.020\n If you're interested in short term making money,\n\n1:58:14.020 --> 1:58:16.500\n go with deep learning, use silicon microelectronics.\n\n1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:20.900\n If you wanna understand things like the physics\n\n1:58:20.900 --> 1:58:23.020\n of a fascinating system,\n\n1:58:23.020 --> 1:58:25.620\n or if you wanna understand something more\n\n1:58:25.620 --> 1:58:27.820\n along the lines of the physical limits\n\n1:58:27.820 --> 1:58:29.460\n of what can be achieved,\n\n1:58:29.460 --> 1:58:32.700\n then I think single photon communication,\n\n1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:35.940\n superconducting electronics is extremely exciting.\n\n1:58:35.940 --> 1:58:39.620\n What if I wanna use superconducting hardware\n\n1:58:39.620 --> 1:58:42.020\n at four Kelvin to mine Bitcoin?\n\n1:58:42.020 --> 1:58:43.260\n That's my main interest.\n\n1:58:44.220 --> 1:58:45.860\n The reason I wanted to talk to you today,\n\n1:58:45.860 --> 1:58:47.660\n I wanna say, no, I don't know.\n\n1:58:47.660 --> 1:58:48.620\n What's Bitcoin?\n\n1:58:51.540 --> 1:58:53.140\n Look it up on the internet.\n\n1:58:53.140 --> 1:58:54.780\n Somebody told me about it.\n\n1:58:54.780 --> 1:58:56.380\n I'm not sure exactly what it is.\n\n1:58:57.500 --> 1:58:59.060\n But let me ask nevertheless\n\n1:58:59.060 --> 1:59:01.380\n about applications to machine learning.\n\n1:59:01.380 --> 1:59:06.380\n Okay, so if you look at the scale of five, 10, 20 years,\n\n1:59:07.300 --> 1:59:11.900\n is it possible to, before we understand the nature\n\n1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:14.420\n of human intelligence and general intelligence,\n\n1:59:14.420 --> 1:59:19.100\n do you think we'll start falling out of this exploration\n\n1:59:19.100 --> 1:59:23.100\n of neuromorphic systems ability to solve some\n\n1:59:23.100 --> 1:59:25.180\n of the problems that the machine learning systems\n\n1:59:25.180 --> 1:59:26.420\n of today can't solve?\n\n1:59:26.420 --> 1:59:31.420\n Well, I'm really hesitant to over promise.\n\n1:59:31.620 --> 1:59:34.100\n So I really don't know.\n\n1:59:34.100 --> 1:59:36.740\n Also, I don't really understand machine learning\n\n1:59:36.740 --> 1:59:37.580\n in a lot of senses.\n\n1:59:37.580 --> 1:59:42.580\n I mean, machine learning from my perspective appears\n\n1:59:42.900 --> 1:59:47.900\n to require that you know precisely what your input is\n\n1:59:49.180 --> 1:59:51.700\n and also what your goal is.\n\n1:59:51.700 --> 1:59:53.300\n You usually have some objective function\n\n1:59:53.300 --> 1:59:54.140\n or something like that.\n\n1:59:54.140 --> 1:59:57.300\n And that's very limiting.\n\n1:59:57.300 --> 2:00:00.540\n I mean, of course, a lot of times that's the case.\n\n2:00:00.540 --> 2:00:03.940\n There's a picture and there's a horse in it, so you're done.\n\n2:00:03.940 --> 2:00:06.500\n But that's not a very interesting problem.\n\n2:00:06.500 --> 2:00:09.500\n I think when I think about intelligence,\n\n2:00:09.500 --> 2:00:13.200\n it's almost defined by the ability to handle problems\n\n2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:15.940\n where you don't know what your inputs are going to be\n\n2:00:15.940 --> 2:00:17.420\n and you don't even necessarily know\n\n2:00:17.420 --> 2:00:18.580\n what you're trying to accomplish.\n\n2:00:18.580 --> 2:00:21.620\n I mean, I'm not sure what I'm trying to accomplish\n\n2:00:21.620 --> 2:00:22.540\n in this world.\n\n2:00:22.540 --> 2:00:24.540\n Yeah, at all scales.\n\n2:00:24.540 --> 2:00:25.900\n Yeah, at all scales, right.\n\n2:00:25.900 --> 2:00:30.900\n I mean, so I'm more drawn to the underlying phenomena,\n\n2:00:33.700 --> 2:00:37.940\n the critical dynamics of this system,\n\n2:00:37.940 --> 2:00:41.900\n trying to understand how elements that you build\n\n2:00:41.900 --> 2:00:46.900\n into your hardware result in emergent fascinating activity\n\n2:00:48.580 --> 2:00:51.740\n that was very difficult to predict, things like that.\n\n2:00:51.740 --> 2:00:53.660\n So, but I gotta be really careful\n\n2:00:53.660 --> 2:00:55.580\n because I think a lot of other people who,\n\n2:00:55.580 --> 2:00:57.700\n if they found themselves working on this project\n\n2:00:57.700 --> 2:00:59.300\n in my shoes, they would say, all right,\n\n2:00:59.300 --> 2:01:01.660\n what are all the different ways we can use this\n\n2:01:01.660 --> 2:01:02.500\n for machine learning?\n\n2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:05.340\n Actually, let me just definitely mention colleague\n\n2:01:05.340 --> 2:01:06.660\n at NIST, Mike Schneider.\n\n2:01:06.660 --> 2:01:09.340\n He's also very much interested,\n\n2:01:09.340 --> 2:01:11.720\n particularly in the superconducting side of things,\n\n2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:14.920\n using the incredible speed, power efficiency,\n\n2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:16.620\n also Ken Seagal at Colgate,\n\n2:01:16.620 --> 2:01:18.780\n other people working on specifically\n\n2:01:18.780 --> 2:01:22.020\n the superconducting side of this for machine learning\n\n2:01:22.020 --> 2:01:25.060\n and deep feed forward neural networks.\n\n2:01:25.060 --> 2:01:27.400\n There, the advantages are obvious.\n\n2:01:27.400 --> 2:01:28.780\n It's extremely fast.\n\n2:01:28.780 --> 2:01:31.880\n Yeah, so that's less on the nature of intelligences\n\n2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:35.740\n and more on various characteristics of this hardware\n\n2:01:35.740 --> 2:01:38.340\n that you can use for the basic computation\n\n2:01:38.340 --> 2:01:40.680\n as we know it today and communication.\n\n2:01:40.680 --> 2:01:42.900\n One of the things that Mike Schneider's working on right now\n\n2:01:42.900 --> 2:01:46.160\n is an image classifier at a relatively small scale.\n\n2:01:46.160 --> 2:01:48.380\n I think he's targeting that nine pixel problem\n\n2:01:48.380 --> 2:01:50.100\n where you can have three different characters\n\n2:01:50.100 --> 2:01:54.240\n and you put in a nine pixel image\n\n2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:58.420\n and you classify it as one of these three categories.\n\n2:01:58.420 --> 2:02:00.160\n And that's gonna be really interesting\n\n2:02:00.160 --> 2:02:01.260\n to see what happens there,\n\n2:02:01.260 --> 2:02:05.720\n because if you can show that even at that scale,\n\n2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:08.180\n you just put these images in and you get it out\n\n2:02:08.180 --> 2:02:09.540\n and he thinks he can do it,\n\n2:02:09.540 --> 2:02:11.180\n I forgot if it's a nanosecond\n\n2:02:11.180 --> 2:02:14.040\n or some extremely fast classification time,\n\n2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:14.880\n it's probably less,\n\n2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:17.420\n it's probably a hundred picoseconds or something.\n\n2:02:17.420 --> 2:02:18.820\n There you have challenges though,\n\n2:02:18.820 --> 2:02:21.600\n because the Joseph's injunctions themselves,\n\n2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:24.580\n the electronic circuit is extremely power efficient.\n\n2:02:24.580 --> 2:02:26.880\n Some orders of magnitude for something more\n\n2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:29.280\n than a transistor doing the same thing,\n\n2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:31.480\n but when you have to cool it down to four Kelvin,\n\n2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:33.900\n you pay a huge overhead just for keeping it cold,\n\n2:02:33.900 --> 2:02:35.300\n even if it's not doing anything.\n\n2:02:35.300 --> 2:02:40.300\n So it has to work at large scale\n\n2:02:40.680 --> 2:02:43.720\n in order to overcome that power penalty,\n\n2:02:43.720 --> 2:02:45.140\n but that's possible.\n\n2:02:45.140 --> 2:02:48.000\n It's just, it's gonna have to get that performance.\n\n2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:49.720\n And this is sort of what you were asking about before\n\n2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:52.760\n is like how much better than silicon would it need to be?\n\n2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:54.120\n And the answer is, I don't know.\n\n2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:57.220\n I think if it's just overall better than silicon\n\n2:02:57.220 --> 2:03:00.200\n at a problem that a lot of people care about,\n\n2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:02.640\n maybe it's image classification,\n\n2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:03.960\n maybe it's facial recognition,\n\n2:03:03.960 --> 2:03:07.520\n maybe it's monitoring credit transactions, I don't know,\n\n2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:09.000\n then I think it will have a place.\n\n2:03:09.000 --> 2:03:10.440\n It's not gonna be in your cell phone,\n\n2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:12.200\n but it could be in your data center.\n\n2:03:12.200 --> 2:03:16.160\n So what about in terms of the data center,\n\n2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:17.680\n I don't know if you're paying attention\n\n2:03:17.680 --> 2:03:19.080\n to the various systems,\n\n2:03:19.080 --> 2:03:23.880\n like Tesla recently announced DOJO,\n\n2:03:23.880 --> 2:03:27.160\n which is a large scale machine learning training system,\n\n2:03:27.160 --> 2:03:28.940\n that again, the bottleneck there\n\n2:03:28.940 --> 2:03:30.900\n is probably going to be communication\n\n2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:32.800\n between those systems.\n\n2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:34.880\n Is there something from your work\n\n2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:38.720\n on everything we've been talking about\n\n2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:41.640\n in terms of superconductive hardware\n\n2:03:41.640 --> 2:03:43.560\n that could be useful there?\n\n2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:46.720\n Oh, I mean, okay, tomorrow, no.\n\n2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:49.000\n In the long term, it could be the whole thing.\n\n2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:49.840\n It could be nothing.\n\n2:03:49.840 --> 2:03:52.120\n I don't know, but definitely, definitely.\n\n2:03:54.040 --> 2:03:55.160\n When you look at the,\n\n2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.720\n so I don't know that much about DOJO.\n\n2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:58.840\n My understanding is that that's new, right?\n\n2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:01.320\n That's just coming online.\n\n2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:06.320\n Well, I don't even know where it hasn't come online.\n\n2:04:06.960 --> 2:04:09.560\n And when you announce big, sexy,\n\n2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:11.360\n so let me explain to you the way things work\n\n2:04:11.360 --> 2:04:15.680\n in the world of business and marketing.\n\n2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:18.400\n It's not always clear where you are\n\n2:04:18.400 --> 2:04:20.560\n on the coming online part of that.\n\n2:04:20.560 --> 2:04:22.680\n So I don't know where they are exactly,\n\n2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:25.240\n but the vision is from a ground up\n\n2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:28.520\n to build a very, very large scale,\n\n2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:31.080\n modular machine learning, ASIC,\n\n2:04:31.080 --> 2:04:32.640\n basically hardware that's optimized\n\n2:04:32.640 --> 2:04:34.120\n for training neural networks.\n\n2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:36.080\n And of course, there's a lot of companies\n\n2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:39.360\n that are small and big working on this kind of problem.\n\n2:04:39.360 --> 2:04:42.680\n The question is how to do it in a modular way\n\n2:04:42.680 --> 2:04:45.640\n that has very fast communication.\n\n2:04:45.640 --> 2:04:49.520\n The interesting aspect of Tesla is you have a company\n\n2:04:49.520 --> 2:04:54.520\n that at least at this time is so singularly focused\n\n2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:57.720\n on solving a particular machine learning problem\n\n2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:00.880\n and is making obviously a lot of money doing so\n\n2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:02.200\n because the machine learning problem\n\n2:05:02.200 --> 2:05:05.200\n happens to be involved with autonomous driving.\n\n2:05:05.200 --> 2:05:09.760\n So you have a system that's driven by an application.\n\n2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:14.760\n And that's really interesting because you have maybe Google\n\n2:05:15.040 --> 2:05:17.720\n working on TPUs and so on.\n\n2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:21.440\n You have all these other companies with ASICs.\n\n2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:25.960\n They're usually more kind of always thinking general.\n\n2:05:25.960 --> 2:05:29.160\n So I like it when it's driven by a particular application\n\n2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:32.200\n because then you can really get to the,\n\n2:05:32.200 --> 2:05:37.200\n it's somehow if you just talk broadly about intelligence,\n\n2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:40.240\n you may not always get to the right solutions.\n\n2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:41.560\n It's nice to couple that sometimes\n\n2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:45.600\n with specific clear illustration\n\n2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.640\n of something that requires general intelligence,\n\n2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.880\n which for me driving is one such case.\n\n2:05:49.880 --> 2:05:51.080\n I think you're exactly right.\n\n2:05:51.080 --> 2:05:54.360\n Sometimes just having that focus on that application\n\n2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:57.640\n brings a lot of people focuses their energy and attention.\n\n2:05:57.640 --> 2:06:00.200\n I think that, so one of the things that's appealing\n\n2:06:00.200 --> 2:06:02.440\n about what you're saying is not just\n\n2:06:02.440 --> 2:06:03.840\n that the application is specific,\n\n2:06:03.840 --> 2:06:06.040\n but also that the scale is big\n\n2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:10.640\n and that the benefit is also huge.\n\n2:06:10.640 --> 2:06:12.280\n Financial and to humanity.\n\n2:06:12.280 --> 2:06:13.120\n Right, right, right.\n\n2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:15.480\n Yeah, so I guess let me just try to understand\n\n2:06:15.480 --> 2:06:17.960\n is the point of this dojo system\n\n2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:21.840\n to figure out the parameters\n\n2:06:21.840 --> 2:06:23.840\n that then plug into neural networks\n\n2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:26.520\n and then you don't need to retrain,\n\n2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:29.080\n you just make copies of a certain chip\n\n2:06:29.080 --> 2:06:32.320\n that has all the other parameters established or?\n\n2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:36.760\n No, it's straight up retraining a large neural network\n\n2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:38.560\n over and over and over.\n\n2:06:38.560 --> 2:06:41.640\n So you have to do it once for every new car?\n\n2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:44.800\n No, no, you have to, so they do this interesting process,\n\n2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:47.000\n which I think is a process for machine learning,\n\n2:06:47.000 --> 2:06:49.200\n supervised machine learning systems\n\n2:06:49.200 --> 2:06:53.720\n you're going to have to do, which is you have a system,\n\n2:06:53.720 --> 2:06:56.400\n you train your network once, it takes a long time.\n\n2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:58.720\n I don't know how long, but maybe a week.\n\n2:06:58.720 --> 2:06:59.760\n Okay. To train.\n\n2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:05.080\n And then you deploy it on, let's say about a million cars.\n\n2:07:05.080 --> 2:07:05.920\n I don't know what the number is.\n\n2:07:05.920 --> 2:07:07.840\n But that part, you just write software\n\n2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:10.680\n that updates some weights in a table and yeah, okay.\n\n2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:12.640\n But there's a loop back.\n\n2:07:12.640 --> 2:07:13.480\n Yeah, yeah, okay.\n\n2:07:13.480 --> 2:07:17.480\n Each of those cars run into trouble, rarely,\n\n2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:23.720\n but they catch the edge cases\n\n2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:26.080\n of the performance of that particular system\n\n2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:28.320\n and then send that data back\n\n2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:31.440\n and either automatically or by humans,\n\n2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:34.760\n that weird edge case data is annotated\n\n2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:37.560\n and then the network has to become smart enough\n\n2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:40.120\n to now be able to perform in those edge cases,\n\n2:07:40.120 --> 2:07:41.800\n so it has to get retrained.\n\n2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:43.960\n There's clever ways of retraining different parts\n\n2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:46.240\n of that network, but for the most part,\n\n2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:49.280\n I think they prefer to retrain the entire thing.\n\n2:07:49.280 --> 2:07:51.320\n So you have this giant monster\n\n2:07:51.320 --> 2:07:54.880\n that kind of has to be retrained regularly.\n\n2:07:54.880 --> 2:07:58.960\n I think the vision with Dojo is to have\n\n2:07:58.960 --> 2:08:02.320\n a very large machine learning focused,\n\n2:08:02.320 --> 2:08:05.200\n driving focused supercomputer\n\n2:08:05.200 --> 2:08:07.600\n that then is sufficiently modular\n\n2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:11.040\n that can be scaled to other machine learning applications.\n\n2:08:11.040 --> 2:08:12.760\n So they're not limiting themselves completely\n\n2:08:12.760 --> 2:08:14.000\n to this particular application,\n\n2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:17.440\n but this application is the way they kind of test\n\n2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:19.760\n this iterative process of machine learning\n\n2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:23.440\n is you make a system that's very dumb,\n\n2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:27.160\n deploy it, get the edge cases where it fails,\n\n2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:30.000\n make it a little smarter, it becomes a little less dumb\n\n2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.000\n and that iterative process achieves something\n\n2:08:33.000 --> 2:08:36.160\n that you can call intelligent or is smart enough\n\n2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:37.960\n to be able to solve this particular application.\n\n2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:42.960\n So it has to do with training neural networks fast\n\n2:08:43.680 --> 2:08:45.920\n and training neural networks that are large.\n\n2:08:45.920 --> 2:08:49.920\n But also based on an extraordinary amount of diverse input.\n\n2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:50.760\n Data, yeah.\n\n2:08:50.760 --> 2:08:51.920\n And that's one of the things,\n\n2:08:51.920 --> 2:08:54.520\n so this does seem like one of those spaces\n\n2:08:54.520 --> 2:08:58.920\n where the scale of superconducting optoelectronics,\n\n2:08:58.920 --> 2:09:02.520\n the way that, so when you talk about the weaknesses,\n\n2:09:02.520 --> 2:09:04.120\n like I said, okay, well, you have to cool it down.\n\n2:09:04.120 --> 2:09:05.760\n At this scale, that's fine.\n\n2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:09.440\n Because that's not too much of an added cost.\n\n2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:10.960\n Most of your power is being dissipated\n\n2:09:10.960 --> 2:09:12.920\n by the circuits themselves, not the cooling.\n\n2:09:12.920 --> 2:09:17.920\n And also you have one centralized kind of cognitive hub,\n\n2:09:19.400 --> 2:09:20.800\n if you will.\n\n2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:24.840\n And so if we're talking about putting\n\n2:09:24.840 --> 2:09:28.640\n a superconducting system in a car, that's questionable.\n\n2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:30.080\n Do you really wanna cryostat\n\n2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:31.400\n in the trunk of everyone in your car?\n\n2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:32.920\n It'll fit, it's not that big of a deal,\n\n2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:35.720\n but hopefully there's a better way, right?\n\n2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:39.080\n But since this is sort of a central supreme intelligence\n\n2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.360\n or something like that,\n\n2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:45.120\n and it needs to really have this massive data acquisition,\n\n2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:47.080\n massive data integration,\n\n2:09:47.080 --> 2:09:49.120\n I would think that that's where large scale\n\n2:09:49.120 --> 2:09:51.280\n spiking neural networks with vast communication\n\n2:09:51.280 --> 2:09:53.160\n and all these things would have something\n\n2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:54.280\n pretty tremendous to offer.\n\n2:09:54.280 --> 2:09:55.760\n It's not gonna happen tomorrow.\n\n2:09:55.760 --> 2:09:58.280\n There's a lot of development that needs to be done.\n\n2:09:58.280 --> 2:10:01.440\n But we have to be patient with self driving cars\n\n2:10:01.440 --> 2:10:02.280\n for a lot of reasons.\n\n2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:04.600\n We were all optimistic that they would be here by now.\n\n2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:06.480\n And okay, they are to some extent,\n\n2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:09.560\n but if we're thinking five or 10 years down the line,\n\n2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:12.080\n it's not unreasonable.\n\n2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:15.200\n One other thing, let me just mention,\n\n2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:17.400\n getting into self driving cars and technologies\n\n2:10:17.400 --> 2:10:19.680\n that are using AI out in the world,\n\n2:10:19.680 --> 2:10:21.520\n this is something NIST cares a lot about.\n\n2:10:21.520 --> 2:10:25.720\n Elham Tabassi is leading up a much larger effort in AI\n\n2:10:25.720 --> 2:10:29.320\n at NIST than my little project.\n\n2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:32.680\n And really central to that mission\n\n2:10:32.680 --> 2:10:35.000\n is this concept of trustworthiness.\n\n2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:38.920\n So when you're going to deploy this neural network\n\n2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:43.320\n in every single automobile with so much on the line,\n\n2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:45.240\n you have to be able to trust that.\n\n2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:48.040\n So now how do we know that we can trust that?\n\n2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:50.080\n How do we know that we can trust the self driving car\n\n2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:53.720\n or the supercomputer that trained it?\n\n2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:54.840\n There's a lot of work there\n\n2:10:54.840 --> 2:10:56.960\n and there's a lot of that going on at NIST.\n\n2:10:56.960 --> 2:10:58.200\n And it's still early days.\n\n2:10:58.200 --> 2:11:01.840\n I mean, you're familiar with the problem and all that.\n\n2:11:01.840 --> 2:11:04.480\n But there's a fascinating dance in engineering\n\n2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:06.680\n with safety critical systems.\n\n2:11:06.680 --> 2:11:08.840\n There's a desire in computer science,\n\n2:11:08.840 --> 2:11:10.640\n just recently talked to Don Knuth,\n\n2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:14.800\n for algorithms and for systems,\n\n2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:17.440\n for them to be provably correct or provably safe.\n\n2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:20.320\n And this is one other difference\n\n2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:22.320\n between humans and biological systems\n\n2:11:22.320 --> 2:11:24.840\n is we're not provably anything.\n\n2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:29.760\n And so there's some aspect of imperfection\n\n2:11:29.760 --> 2:11:32.160\n that we need to have built in,\n\n2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:37.160\n like robustness to imperfection be part of our systems,\n\n2:11:37.920 --> 2:11:40.680\n which is a difficult thing for engineers to contend with.\n\n2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:42.800\n They're very uncomfortable with the idea\n\n2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:46.880\n that you have to be okay with failure\n\n2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:49.720\n and almost engineer failure into the system.\n\n2:11:49.720 --> 2:11:50.960\n Mathematicians hate it too.\n\n2:11:50.960 --> 2:11:53.640\n But I think it was Turing who said something\n\n2:11:53.640 --> 2:11:55.040\n along the lines of,\n\n2:11:55.040 --> 2:11:57.080\n I can give you an intelligent system\n\n2:11:57.080 --> 2:11:59.520\n or I can give you a flawless system,\n\n2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:00.880\n but I can't give you both.\n\n2:12:00.880 --> 2:12:04.120\n And it's in sort of creativity and abstract thinking\n\n2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:07.840\n seem to rely somewhat on stochasticity\n\n2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:11.320\n and not having components\n\n2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:13.760\n that perform exactly the same way every time.\n\n2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:16.000\n This is where like the disagreement I have with,\n\n2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.560\n not disagreement, but a different view on the world.\n\n2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:19.680\n I'm with Turing,\n\n2:12:19.680 --> 2:12:24.600\n but when I talk to robotic, robot colleagues,\n\n2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:26.440\n that sounds like I'm talking to robots,\n\n2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:28.840\n colleagues that are roboticists,\n\n2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:31.920\n the goal is perfection.\n\n2:12:31.920 --> 2:12:33.960\n And to me is like, no,\n\n2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:38.880\n I think the goal should be imperfection\n\n2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:40.960\n that's communicated.\n\n2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:44.160\n And through the interaction between humans and robots,\n\n2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:49.160\n that imperfection becomes a feature, not a bug.\n\n2:12:49.600 --> 2:12:52.160\n Like together, seen as a system,\n\n2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:53.680\n the human and the robot together\n\n2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:56.400\n are better than either of them individually,\n\n2:12:56.400 --> 2:13:00.520\n but the robot itself is not perfect in any way.\n\n2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:02.760\n Of course, there's a bunch of disagreements,\n\n2:13:02.760 --> 2:13:04.920\n including with Mr. Elon about,\n\n2:13:06.360 --> 2:13:08.640\n to me, autonomous driving is fundamentally\n\n2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:10.760\n a human robot interaction problem,\n\n2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.360\n not a robotics problem.\n\n2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:14.320\n To Elon, it's a robotics problem.\n\n2:13:14.320 --> 2:13:18.560\n That's actually an open and fascinating question,\n\n2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:21.680\n whether humans can be removed from the loop completely.\n\n2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:27.680\n We've talked about a lot of fascinating chemistry\n\n2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:31.240\n and physics and engineering,\n\n2:13:31.240 --> 2:13:33.680\n and we're always running up against this issue\n\n2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:37.560\n that nature seems to dictate what's easy and what's hard.\n\n2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.080\n So you have this cool little paper\n\n2:13:40.080 --> 2:13:42.760\n that I'd love to just ask you about.\n\n2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:44.520\n It's titled,\n\n2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:48.200\n Does Cosmological Evolution Select for Technology?\n\n2:13:48.200 --> 2:13:53.200\n So in physics, there's parameters\n\n2:13:53.240 --> 2:13:56.200\n that seem to define the way our universe works,\n\n2:13:56.200 --> 2:13:59.320\n that physics works, that if it worked any differently,\n\n2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:01.720\n we would get a very different world.\n\n2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:04.240\n So it seems like the parameters are very fine tuned\n\n2:14:04.240 --> 2:14:06.480\n to the kind of physics that we see.\n\n2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:08.560\n All the beautiful E equals MC squared,\n\n2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.440\n they would get these nice, beautiful laws.\n\n2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:13.160\n It seems like very fine tuned for that.\n\n2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:15.960\n So what you argue in this article\n\n2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:20.600\n is it may be that the universe has also fine tuned\n\n2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:25.400\n its parameters that enable the kind of technological\n\n2:14:25.400 --> 2:14:29.600\n innovation that we see, the technology that we see.\n\n2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:31.520\n Can you explain this idea?\n\n2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:33.440\n Yeah, I think you've introduced it nicely.\n\n2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:38.440\n Let me just try to say a few things in my language layout.\n\n2:14:39.560 --> 2:14:41.680\n What is this fine tuning problem?\n\n2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:46.560\n So physicists have spent centuries trying to understand\n\n2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:51.560\n the system of equations that govern the way nature behaves,\n\n2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:55.120\n the way particles move and interact with each other.\n\n2:14:55.120 --> 2:15:00.120\n And as that understanding has become more clear over time,\n\n2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:05.120\n it became sort of evident that it's all well adjusted\n\n2:15:07.640 --> 2:15:12.640\n to allow a universe like we see, very complex,\n\n2:15:13.040 --> 2:15:16.480\n this large, long lived universe.\n\n2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:19.920\n And so one answer to that is, well, of course it is\n\n2:15:19.920 --> 2:15:21.520\n because we wouldn't be here otherwise.\n\n2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:24.400\n But I don't know, that's not very satisfying.\n\n2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:25.560\n That's sort of, that's what's known\n\n2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:27.240\n as the weak anthropic principle.\n\n2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:29.200\n It's a statement of selection bias.\n\n2:15:29.200 --> 2:15:33.640\n We can only observe a universe that is fit for us to live in.\n\n2:15:33.640 --> 2:15:34.960\n So what does it mean for a universe\n\n2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:36.120\n to be fit for us to live in?\n\n2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:38.400\n Well, the pursuit of physics,\n\n2:15:38.400 --> 2:15:42.600\n it is based partially on coming up with equations\n\n2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:44.640\n that describe how things behave\n\n2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:46.280\n and interact with each other.\n\n2:15:46.280 --> 2:15:48.480\n But in all those equations you have,\n\n2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:49.960\n so there's the form of the equation,\n\n2:15:49.960 --> 2:15:54.200\n sort of how different fields or particles\n\n2:15:54.200 --> 2:15:56.480\n move in space and time.\n\n2:15:56.480 --> 2:15:58.480\n But then there are also the parameters\n\n2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:01.120\n that just tell you sort of the strength\n\n2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:02.840\n of different couplings.\n\n2:16:02.840 --> 2:16:05.160\n How strongly does a charged particle\n\n2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:07.600\n couple to the electromagnetic field or masses?\n\n2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:10.760\n How strongly does a particle couple\n\n2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:12.960\n to the Higgs field or something like that?\n\n2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:16.960\n And those parameters that define,\n\n2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:19.760\n not the general structure of the equations,\n\n2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:23.600\n but the relative importance of different terms,\n\n2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:25.240\n they seem to be every bit as important\n\n2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:27.760\n as the structure of the equations themselves.\n\n2:16:27.760 --> 2:16:29.400\n And so I forget who it was.\n\n2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:31.200\n Somebody, when they were working through this\n\n2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:34.000\n and trying to see, okay, if I adjust the parameter,\n\n2:16:34.000 --> 2:16:34.840\n this parameter over here,\n\n2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:36.800\n call it the, say the fine structure constant,\n\n2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:37.920\n which tells us the strength\n\n2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:40.400\n of the electromagnetic interaction.\n\n2:16:40.400 --> 2:16:42.320\n Oh boy, I can't change it very much.\n\n2:16:42.320 --> 2:16:43.720\n Otherwise nothing works.\n\n2:16:43.720 --> 2:16:45.360\n The universe sort of doesn't,\n\n2:16:45.360 --> 2:16:47.240\n it just pops into existence and goes away\n\n2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:48.920\n in a nanosecond or something like that.\n\n2:16:48.920 --> 2:16:51.040\n And somebody had the phrase,\n\n2:16:51.040 --> 2:16:52.920\n this looks like a put up job,\n\n2:16:52.920 --> 2:16:57.080\n meaning every one of these parameters was dialed in.\n\n2:16:57.080 --> 2:17:00.680\n It's arguable how precisely they have to be dialed in,\n\n2:17:00.680 --> 2:17:03.040\n but dialed in to some extent,\n\n2:17:03.040 --> 2:17:05.360\n not just in order to enable our existence,\n\n2:17:05.360 --> 2:17:07.120\n that's a very anthropocentric view,\n\n2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:10.000\n but to enable a universe like this one.\n\n2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:14.040\n So, okay, maybe I think the majority position\n\n2:17:14.040 --> 2:17:17.000\n of working physicists in the field is,\n\n2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:18.960\n it has to be that way in order for us to exist.\n\n2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:20.400\n We're here, we shouldn't be surprised\n\n2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:22.800\n that that's the way the universe is.\n\n2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:24.520\n And I don't know, for a while,\n\n2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:26.120\n that never sat well with me,\n\n2:17:26.120 --> 2:17:28.040\n but I just kind of moved on\n\n2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:29.440\n because there are things to do\n\n2:17:29.440 --> 2:17:31.160\n and a lot of exciting work.\n\n2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:33.760\n It doesn't depend on resolving this puzzle,\n\n2:17:33.760 --> 2:17:38.760\n but as I started working more with technology,\n\n2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:41.840\n getting into the more recent years of my career,\n\n2:17:41.840 --> 2:17:43.720\n particularly when I started,\n\n2:17:43.720 --> 2:17:46.520\n after having worked with silicon for a long time,\n\n2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:49.000\n which was kind of eerie on its own,\n\n2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:51.120\n but then when I switched over to superconductors,\n\n2:17:51.120 --> 2:17:53.560\n I was just like, this is crazy.\n\n2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:57.360\n It's just absolutely astonishing\n\n2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:00.560\n that our universe gives us superconductivity.\n\n2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:02.440\n It's one of the most beautiful physical phenomena\n\n2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:06.560\n and it's also extraordinarily useful for technology.\n\n2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:07.920\n So you can argue that the universe\n\n2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:11.280\n has to have the parameters it does for us to exist\n\n2:18:11.280 --> 2:18:13.000\n because we couldn't be here otherwise,\n\n2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:14.760\n but why does it give us technology?\n\n2:18:14.760 --> 2:18:18.840\n Why does it give us silicon that has this ideal oxide\n\n2:18:18.840 --> 2:18:20.920\n that allows us to make a transistor\n\n2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:23.640\n without trying that hard?\n\n2:18:23.640 --> 2:18:26.760\n That can't be explained by the same anthropic reasoning.\n\n2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:30.360\n Yeah, so it's asking the why question.\n\n2:18:30.360 --> 2:18:34.680\n I mean, a slight natural extension of that question is,\n\n2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:38.440\n I wonder if the parameters were different\n\n2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:44.240\n if we would simply have just another set of paint brushes\n\n2:18:44.240 --> 2:18:46.880\n to create totally other things\n\n2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:49.240\n that wouldn't look like anything\n\n2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:50.880\n like the technology of today,\n\n2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:54.520\n but would nevertheless have incredible complexity,\n\n2:18:54.520 --> 2:18:57.160\n which is if you sort of zoom out and start defining things,\n\n2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:01.400\n not by like how many batteries it needs\n\n2:19:01.400 --> 2:19:03.560\n and whether it can make toast,\n\n2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:06.440\n but more like how much complexity is within the system\n\n2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:07.280\n or something like that.\n\n2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:10.000\n Well, yeah, you can start to quantify things.\n\n2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:10.840\n You're exactly right.\n\n2:19:10.840 --> 2:19:13.720\n So nowhere am I arguing that\n\n2:19:13.720 --> 2:19:15.840\n in all of the vast parameter space\n\n2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:18.000\n of everything that could conceivably exist\n\n2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:20.640\n in the multiverse of nature,\n\n2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:23.280\n there's this one point in parameter space\n\n2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:25.160\n where complexity arises.\n\n2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:26.640\n I doubt it.\n\n2:19:26.640 --> 2:19:31.120\n That would be a shameful waste of resources, it seems.\n\n2:19:31.120 --> 2:19:33.880\n But it might be that we reside\n\n2:19:33.880 --> 2:19:35.640\n at one place in parameter space\n\n2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:40.040\n that has been adapted through an evolutionary process\n\n2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:43.440\n to allow us to make certain technologies\n\n2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:47.080\n that allow our particular kind of universe to arise\n\n2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:49.760\n and sort of achieve the things it does.\n\n2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:52.720\n See, I wonder if nature in this kind of discussion,\n\n2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:55.720\n if nature is a catalyst for innovation\n\n2:19:55.720 --> 2:19:57.680\n or if it's a ceiling for innovation.\n\n2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:00.800\n So like, is it going to always limit us?\n\n2:20:00.800 --> 2:20:04.000\n Like you're talking about silicon.\n\n2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:06.640\n Is it just make it super easy to do awesome stuff\n\n2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:08.000\n in a certain dimension,\n\n2:20:08.000 --> 2:20:10.240\n but we could still do awesome stuff in other ways,\n\n2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:11.560\n it'll just be harder?\n\n2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:15.440\n Or does it really set like the maximum we can do?\n\n2:20:15.440 --> 2:20:17.840\n That's a good thing to,\n\n2:20:17.840 --> 2:20:19.400\n that's a good subject to discuss.\n\n2:20:19.400 --> 2:20:20.960\n I guess I feel like we need to lay\n\n2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:23.160\n a little bit more groundwork.\n\n2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:24.760\n So I want to make sure that\n\n2:20:27.560 --> 2:20:29.240\n I introduce this in the context\n\n2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:31.800\n of Lee Smolin's previous idea.\n\n2:20:31.800 --> 2:20:35.640\n So who's Lee Smolin and what kind of ideas does he have?\n\n2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:39.000\n Okay, Lee Smolin is a theoretical physicist\n\n2:20:39.000 --> 2:20:42.440\n who back in the late 1980s published a paper\n\n2:20:42.440 --> 2:20:45.040\n in the early 1990s introduced this idea\n\n2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:47.000\n of cosmological natural selection,\n\n2:20:47.000 --> 2:20:51.440\n which argues that the universe did evolve.\n\n2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:54.480\n So his paper was called, did the universe evolve?\n\n2:20:54.480 --> 2:20:59.480\n And I gave myself the liberty of titling my paper\n\n2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.440\n does cosmological selection\n\n2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:03.960\n or does cosmological evolution select for technology\n\n2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:05.000\n in reference to that.\n\n2:21:05.000 --> 2:21:08.200\n So he introduced that idea decades ago.\n\n2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:12.200\n Now he primarily works on quantum gravity,\n\n2:21:12.200 --> 2:21:14.640\n loop quantum gravity, other approaches to\n\n2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:19.280\n unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity,\n\n2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:22.360\n as you can read about in his most recent book, I believe,\n\n2:21:22.360 --> 2:21:24.280\n and he's been on your show as well.\n\n2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:27.760\n So, but I want to introduce this idea\n\n2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:29.360\n of cosmological natural selection,\n\n2:21:29.360 --> 2:21:32.640\n because I think that is one of the core ideas\n\n2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:35.320\n that could change our understanding\n\n2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:37.800\n of how the universe got here, our role in it,\n\n2:21:37.800 --> 2:21:39.840\n what technology is doing here.\n\n2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:41.240\n But there's a couple more pieces\n\n2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:42.360\n that need to be set up first.\n\n2:21:42.360 --> 2:21:46.320\n So the beginning of our universe is largely accepted\n\n2:21:46.320 --> 2:21:47.360\n to be the big bang.\n\n2:21:47.360 --> 2:21:49.920\n And what that means is if you look back in time\n\n2:21:49.920 --> 2:21:52.640\n by looking far away in space,\n\n2:21:52.640 --> 2:21:56.960\n you see that everything used to be at one point\n\n2:21:56.960 --> 2:21:58.920\n and it expanded away from there.\n\n2:21:58.920 --> 2:22:03.920\n There was an era in the evolutionary process of our universe\n\n2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:05.520\n that was called inflation.\n\n2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:08.880\n And this idea was developed primarily by Alan Guth\n\n2:22:08.880 --> 2:22:13.120\n and others, Andre Linde and others in the 80s.\n\n2:22:13.120 --> 2:22:16.040\n And this idea of inflation is basically that\n\n2:22:16.040 --> 2:22:21.040\n when a singularity begins this process of growth,\n\n2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:27.560\n there can be a temporary stage\n\n2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:30.880\n where it just accelerates incredibly rapidly.\n\n2:22:30.880 --> 2:22:33.760\n And based on quantum field theory,\n\n2:22:33.760 --> 2:22:35.720\n this tells us that this should produce matter\n\n2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:37.840\n in precisely the proportions that we find\n\n2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:39.960\n of hydrogen and helium in the big bang,\n\n2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:44.800\n lithium too, lithium also, and other things too.\n\n2:22:44.800 --> 2:22:47.120\n So the predictions that come out of big bang\n\n2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:50.720\n inflationary cosmology have stood up extremely well\n\n2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:52.520\n to empirical verification,\n\n2:22:52.520 --> 2:22:55.720\n the cosmic microwave background, things like this.\n\n2:22:55.720 --> 2:22:59.520\n So most scientists working in the field\n\n2:22:59.520 --> 2:23:03.720\n think that the origin of our universe is the big bang.\n\n2:23:03.720 --> 2:23:08.040\n And I base all my thinking on that as well.\n\n2:23:08.040 --> 2:23:11.440\n I'm just laying this out there so that people understand\n\n2:23:11.440 --> 2:23:14.160\n that where I'm coming from is an extension,\n\n2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:19.080\n not a replacement of existing well founded ideas.\n\n2:23:19.080 --> 2:23:23.800\n In a paper, I believe it was 1986 with Alan Guth\n\n2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:26.560\n and another author Farhi,\n\n2:23:26.560 --> 2:23:30.240\n they wrote that a big bang,\n\n2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:31.520\n I don't remember the exact quote,\n\n2:23:31.520 --> 2:23:35.280\n a big bang is inextricably linked with a black hole.\n\n2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:39.240\n The singularity that we call our origin\n\n2:23:39.240 --> 2:23:42.000\n is mathematically indistinguishable from a black hole.\n\n2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:44.360\n They're the same thing.\n\n2:23:44.360 --> 2:23:48.880\n And Lee Smolin based his thinking on that idea,\n\n2:23:48.880 --> 2:23:50.720\n I believe, I don't mean to speak for him,\n\n2:23:50.720 --> 2:23:52.080\n but this is my reading of it.\n\n2:23:52.080 --> 2:23:55.000\n So what Lee Smolin will say is that\n\n2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:58.600\n a black hole in one universe is a big bang\n\n2:23:58.600 --> 2:24:00.720\n in another universe.\n\n2:24:00.720 --> 2:24:04.680\n And this allows us to have progeny, offspring.\n\n2:24:04.680 --> 2:24:08.400\n So a universe can be said to have come\n\n2:24:08.400 --> 2:24:10.480\n before another universe.\n\n2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:14.200\n And very crucially, Smolin argues,\n\n2:24:14.200 --> 2:24:16.920\n I think this is potentially one of the great ideas\n\n2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:18.640\n of all time, that's my opinion,\n\n2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:22.400\n that when a black hole forms, it's not a classical entity,\n\n2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:24.520\n it's a quantum gravitational entity.\n\n2:24:24.520 --> 2:24:27.240\n So it is subject to the fluctuations\n\n2:24:27.240 --> 2:24:32.240\n that are inherent in quantum mechanics, the properties,\n\n2:24:34.080 --> 2:24:35.440\n what we're calling the parameters\n\n2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:38.600\n that describe the physics of that system\n\n2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:40.680\n are subject to slight mutations\n\n2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:42.600\n so that the offspring universe\n\n2:24:42.600 --> 2:24:45.200\n does not have the exact same parameters\n\n2:24:45.200 --> 2:24:48.440\n defining its physics as its parent universe.\n\n2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:50.440\n They're close, but they're a little bit different.\n\n2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:55.160\n And so now you have a mechanism for evolution,\n\n2:24:55.160 --> 2:24:57.280\n for natural selection.\n\n2:24:57.280 --> 2:24:59.680\n So there's mutation, so there's,\n\n2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:03.280\n and then if you think about the DNA of the universe\n\n2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:05.880\n are the basic parameters that govern its laws.\n\n2:25:05.880 --> 2:25:10.880\n Exactly, so what Smolin said is our universe results\n\n2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:14.520\n from an evolutionary process that can be traced back\n\n2:25:14.520 --> 2:25:17.640\n some, he estimated, 200 million generations.\n\n2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:20.640\n Initially, there was something like a vacuum fluctuation\n\n2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:25.640\n that produced through random chance a universe\n\n2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:27.280\n that was able to reproduce just one.\n\n2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:28.640\n So now it had one offspring.\n\n2:25:28.640 --> 2:25:30.960\n And then over time, it was able to make more and more\n\n2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:35.280\n until it evolved into a highly structured universe\n\n2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:40.160\n with a very long lifetime, with a great deal of complexity\n\n2:25:40.160 --> 2:25:44.080\n and importantly, especially importantly for Lee Smolin,\n\n2:25:44.080 --> 2:25:47.160\n stars, stars make black holes.\n\n2:25:47.160 --> 2:25:49.720\n Therefore, we should expect our universe\n\n2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:53.160\n to be optimized, have its physical parameters optimized\n\n2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:55.600\n to make very large numbers of stars\n\n2:25:55.600 --> 2:25:57.840\n because that's how you make black holes\n\n2:25:57.840 --> 2:25:59.440\n and black holes make offspring.\n\n2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:03.720\n So we expect the physics of our universe to have evolved\n\n2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:06.720\n to maximize fecundity, the number of offspring.\n\n2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:09.200\n And the way Lee Smolin argues you do that\n\n2:26:09.200 --> 2:26:12.160\n is through stars that the biggest ones die\n\n2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:13.440\n in these core collapse supernova\n\n2:26:13.440 --> 2:26:15.720\n that make a black hole and a child.\n\n2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:19.200\n Okay, first of all, I agree with you\n\n2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:24.200\n that this is back to our fractal view of everything\n\n2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:27.240\n from intelligence to our universe.\n\n2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:31.120\n That is very compelling and a very powerful idea\n\n2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:36.120\n that unites the origin of life\n\n2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:39.760\n and perhaps the origin of ideas and intelligence.\n\n2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:42.200\n So from a Dawkins perspective here on earth,\n\n2:26:42.200 --> 2:26:45.360\n the evolution of those and then the evolution\n\n2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:49.640\n of the laws of physics that led to us.\n\n2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:52.280\n I mean, it's beautiful.\n\n2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:54.840\n And then you stacking on top of that,\n\n2:26:54.840 --> 2:26:57.480\n that maybe we are one of the offspring.\n\n2:26:57.480 --> 2:27:02.320\n Right, okay, so before getting into where I'd like\n\n2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:05.160\n to take that idea, let me just a little bit more groundwork.\n\n2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:07.080\n There is this concept of the multiverse\n\n2:27:07.080 --> 2:27:08.600\n and it can be confusing.\n\n2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:11.760\n Different people use the word multiverse in different ways.\n\n2:27:11.760 --> 2:27:16.760\n In the multiverse that I think is relevant to picture\n\n2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:20.840\n when trying to grasp Lee Smolin's idea,\n\n2:27:20.840 --> 2:27:24.280\n essentially every vacuum fluctuation\n\n2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:25.920\n can be referred to as a universe.\n\n2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:28.840\n It occurs, it borrows energy from the vacuum\n\n2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:30.200\n for some finite amount of time\n\n2:27:30.200 --> 2:27:33.960\n and it evanesces back into the quantum vacuum.\n\n2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:38.960\n And ideas of Guth before that and Andrei Linde\n\n2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:42.480\n with eternal inflation aren't that different\n\n2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.480\n that you would expect nature\n\n2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.920\n due to the quantum properties of the vacuum,\n\n2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:49.480\n which we know exist, they're measurable\n\n2:27:49.480 --> 2:27:52.200\n through things like the Casimir effect and others.\n\n2:27:52.200 --> 2:27:54.200\n You know that there are these fluctuations\n\n2:27:54.200 --> 2:27:55.120\n that are occurring.\n\n2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:58.080\n What Smolin is arguing is that there is\n\n2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:01.400\n this extensive multiverse, that this universe,\n\n2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:04.520\n what we can measure and interact with\n\n2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:07.040\n is not unique in nature.\n\n2:28:07.040 --> 2:28:10.800\n It's just our residents, it's where we reside.\n\n2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:13.640\n And there are countless, potentially infinity\n\n2:28:13.640 --> 2:28:17.280\n other universes, other entire evolutionary trajectories\n\n2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:19.360\n that have evolved into things like\n\n2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:21.000\n what you were mentioning a second ago\n\n2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:24.080\n with different parameters and different ways\n\n2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:26.000\n of achieving complexity and reproduction\n\n2:28:26.000 --> 2:28:27.040\n and all that stuff.\n\n2:28:27.040 --> 2:28:29.520\n So it's not that the evolutionary process\n\n2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:34.240\n is a funnel towards this end point, not at all.\n\n2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:37.000\n Just like the biological evolutionary process\n\n2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:39.320\n that has occurred within our universe\n\n2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:42.800\n is not a unique route toward achieving\n\n2:28:42.800 --> 2:28:45.000\n one specific chosen kind of species.\n\n2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:49.160\n No, we have extraordinary diversity around us.\n\n2:28:49.160 --> 2:28:50.520\n That's what evolution does.\n\n2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:52.200\n And for any one species like us,\n\n2:28:52.200 --> 2:28:54.840\n you might feel like we're at the center of this process.\n\n2:28:54.840 --> 2:28:57.160\n We're the destination of this process,\n\n2:28:57.160 --> 2:28:59.480\n but we're just one of the many\n\n2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:02.240\n nearly infinite branches of this process.\n\n2:29:02.240 --> 2:29:04.240\n And I suspect it is exactly infinite.\n\n2:29:04.240 --> 2:29:09.080\n I mean, I just can't understand how with this idea,\n\n2:29:09.080 --> 2:29:11.040\n you can ever draw a boundary around it and say,\n\n2:29:11.040 --> 2:29:13.480\n no, the universe, I mean, the multiverse\n\n2:29:13.480 --> 2:29:17.720\n has 10 to the one quadrillion components,\n\n2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:18.880\n but not infinity.\n\n2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:20.200\n I don't know that.\n\n2:29:20.200 --> 2:29:24.080\n Well, yeah, I have cognitively incapable\n\n2:29:24.080 --> 2:29:25.680\n as I think all of us are\n\n2:29:25.680 --> 2:29:29.080\n and truly understanding the concept of infinity.\n\n2:29:29.080 --> 2:29:31.000\n And the concept of nothing as well.\n\n2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.320\n And nothing, but also the concept of a lot\n\n2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:35.360\n is pretty difficult.\n\n2:29:35.360 --> 2:29:37.880\n I can just, I can count.\n\n2:29:37.880 --> 2:29:39.920\n I run out of fingers at a certain point\n\n2:29:39.920 --> 2:29:40.760\n and then you're screwed.\n\n2:29:40.760 --> 2:29:41.760\n And when you're wearing shoes\n\n2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:44.400\n and you can't even get down to your toes, it's like.\n\n2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:47.040\n It's like, all right, a thousand fine, a million.\n\n2:29:47.040 --> 2:29:48.040\n Is that what?\n\n2:29:48.040 --> 2:29:50.040\n And then it gets crazier and crazier.\n\n2:29:50.040 --> 2:29:50.880\n Right, right.\n\n2:29:51.720 --> 2:29:54.840\n So this particular, so when we say technology, by the way,\n\n2:29:55.720 --> 2:30:00.640\n I mean, there's some, not to over romanticize the thing,\n\n2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:04.160\n but there is some aspect about this branch of ours\n\n2:30:04.160 --> 2:30:08.040\n that allows us to, for the universe to know itself.\n\n2:30:08.040 --> 2:30:08.960\n Yes, yes.\n\n2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:13.960\n So to be, to have like little conscious cognitive fingers\n\n2:30:15.080 --> 2:30:18.320\n that are able to feel like to scratch the head.\n\n2:30:18.320 --> 2:30:19.640\n Right, right, right.\n\n2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:22.040\n To be able to construct E equals MC squared\n\n2:30:22.040 --> 2:30:25.640\n and to introspect, to start to gain some understanding\n\n2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:27.400\n of the laws that govern it.\n\n2:30:27.400 --> 2:30:32.000\n Isn't that, isn't that kind of amazing?\n\n2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:35.600\n Okay, I'm just human, but it feels like that,\n\n2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:39.200\n if I were to build a system that does this kind of thing,\n\n2:30:39.200 --> 2:30:42.080\n that evolves laws of physics, that evolves life,\n\n2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:45.440\n that evolves intelligence, that my goal would be\n\n2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:48.960\n to come up with things that are able to think about itself.\n\n2:30:48.960 --> 2:30:53.360\n Right, aren't we kind of close to the design specs,\n\n2:30:53.360 --> 2:30:54.680\n the destination?\n\n2:30:54.680 --> 2:30:56.040\n We're pretty close, I don't know.\n\n2:30:56.040 --> 2:30:58.360\n I mean, I'm spending my career designing things\n\n2:30:58.360 --> 2:30:59.800\n that I hope will think about themselves,\n\n2:30:59.800 --> 2:31:02.680\n so you and I aren't too far apart on that one.\n\n2:31:02.680 --> 2:31:05.520\n But then maybe that problem is a lot harder\n\n2:31:05.520 --> 2:31:06.360\n than we imagine.\n\n2:31:06.360 --> 2:31:07.800\n Maybe we need to.\n\n2:31:07.800 --> 2:31:09.480\n Let's not get, let's not get too far\n\n2:31:09.480 --> 2:31:12.040\n because I want to emphasize something that,\n\n2:31:12.040 --> 2:31:14.600\n what you're saying is, isn't it fascinating\n\n2:31:14.600 --> 2:31:16.880\n that the universe evolved something\n\n2:31:16.880 --> 2:31:19.880\n that can be conscious, reflect on itself?\n\n2:31:19.880 --> 2:31:23.760\n But Lee Smolin's idea didn't take us there, remember?\n\n2:31:23.760 --> 2:31:25.720\n It took us to stars.\n\n2:31:25.720 --> 2:31:29.160\n Lee Smolin has argued, I think,\n\n2:31:29.160 --> 2:31:32.080\n right on almost every single way\n\n2:31:32.080 --> 2:31:35.760\n that cosmological natural selection\n\n2:31:35.760 --> 2:31:38.720\n could lead to a universe with rich structure.\n\n2:31:38.720 --> 2:31:41.120\n And he argued that the structure,\n\n2:31:41.120 --> 2:31:43.160\n the physics of our universe is designed\n\n2:31:43.160 --> 2:31:46.080\n to make a lot of stars so that they can make black holes.\n\n2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:48.200\n But that doesn't explain what we're doing here.\n\n2:31:48.200 --> 2:31:51.320\n In order for that to be an explanation of us,\n\n2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:55.360\n what you have to assume is that once you made that universe\n\n2:31:55.360 --> 2:31:58.040\n that was capable of producing stars,\n\n2:31:58.040 --> 2:32:00.280\n life, planets, all these other things,\n\n2:32:00.280 --> 2:32:01.280\n we're along for the ride.\n\n2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:02.160\n They got lucky.\n\n2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:05.560\n We're kind of arising, growing up in the cracks,\n\n2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:06.880\n but the universe isn't here for us.\n\n2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:09.200\n We're still kind of a fluke in that picture.\n\n2:32:09.200 --> 2:32:12.400\n And I can't, I don't necessarily have\n\n2:32:12.400 --> 2:32:14.840\n like a philosophical opposition to that stance.\n\n2:32:14.840 --> 2:32:19.840\n It's just not, okay, so I don't think it's complete.\n\n2:32:20.200 --> 2:32:22.960\n So it seems like whatever we got going on here to you,\n\n2:32:22.960 --> 2:32:25.640\n it seems like whatever we have here on earth\n\n2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:28.440\n seems like a thing you might want to select for\n\n2:32:28.440 --> 2:32:29.680\n in this whole big process.\n\n2:32:29.680 --> 2:32:30.520\n Exactly.\n\n2:32:30.520 --> 2:32:32.080\n So if what you are truly,\n\n2:32:32.080 --> 2:32:34.840\n if your entire evolutionary process\n\n2:32:34.840 --> 2:32:36.760\n only cares about fecundity,\n\n2:32:36.760 --> 2:32:39.760\n it only cares about making offspring universes\n\n2:32:39.760 --> 2:32:41.720\n because then there's gonna be the most of them\n\n2:32:41.720 --> 2:32:45.120\n in that local region of hyperspace,\n\n2:32:45.120 --> 2:32:49.320\n which is the set of all possible universes, let's say.\n\n2:32:50.240 --> 2:32:52.800\n You don't care how those universes are made.\n\n2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:54.840\n You know they have to be made by black holes.\n\n2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:57.920\n This is what inflationary theory tells us.\n\n2:32:57.920 --> 2:33:02.040\n The big bang tells us that black holes make universes.\n\n2:33:02.040 --> 2:33:04.200\n But what if there was a technological means\n\n2:33:04.200 --> 2:33:05.920\n to make universes?\n\n2:33:05.920 --> 2:33:09.280\n Stars require a ton of matter\n\n2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:11.640\n because they're not thinking very carefully\n\n2:33:11.640 --> 2:33:12.800\n about how you make a black hole.\n\n2:33:12.800 --> 2:33:15.000\n They're just using gravity, you know?\n\n2:33:16.040 --> 2:33:19.160\n But if we devise technologies\n\n2:33:19.160 --> 2:33:23.280\n that can efficiently compress matter into a singularity,\n\n2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:26.200\n it turns out that if you can compress about 10 kilograms\n\n2:33:26.200 --> 2:33:28.560\n into a very small volume,\n\n2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:29.720\n that will make a black hole\n\n2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:32.360\n that is likely highly probable to inflate\n\n2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:34.720\n into its own offspring universe.\n\n2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:37.080\n This is according to calculations done by other people\n\n2:33:37.080 --> 2:33:38.720\n who are professional quantum theorists,\n\n2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:40.160\n quantum field theorists,\n\n2:33:40.160 --> 2:33:44.480\n and I hope I am grasping what they're telling me correctly.\n\n2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:47.520\n I am somewhat of a translator here.\n\n2:33:47.520 --> 2:33:50.400\n But so that's the position\n\n2:33:50.400 --> 2:33:52.680\n that is particularly intriguing to me,\n\n2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:56.240\n which is that what might have happened is that,\n\n2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.120\n okay, this particular branch on the vast tree of evolution,\n\n2:34:01.120 --> 2:34:03.200\n cosmological evolution that we're talking about,\n\n2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:05.680\n not biological evolution within our universe,\n\n2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:07.760\n but cosmological evolution,\n\n2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:09.560\n went through exactly the process\n\n2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:10.920\n that Elise Mullen described,\n\n2:34:10.920 --> 2:34:15.800\n got to the stage where stars were making lots of black holes\n\n2:34:15.800 --> 2:34:19.480\n but then continued to evolve and somehow bridged that gap\n\n2:34:19.480 --> 2:34:22.040\n and made intelligence and intelligence\n\n2:34:22.040 --> 2:34:24.080\n capable of devising technologies\n\n2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:27.840\n because technologies, intelligent species\n\n2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:29.640\n working in conjunction with technologies\n\n2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:32.080\n could then produce even more.\n\n2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:35.800\n Yeah, more efficiently, more faster and better\n\n2:34:35.800 --> 2:34:36.840\n and more different.\n\n2:34:36.840 --> 2:34:38.800\n Then you start to have different kind of mechanisms\n\n2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:40.800\n and mutation perhaps, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:43.080\n And so if you do a simple calculation that says,\n\n2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:44.960\n all right, if I want to,\n\n2:34:44.960 --> 2:34:49.960\n we know roughly how many core collapse supernovae\n\n2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:54.440\n have resulted in black holes in our galaxy\n\n2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:55.960\n since the beginning of the universe\n\n2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:57.720\n and it's something like a billion.\n\n2:34:57.720 --> 2:35:00.600\n So then you would have to estimate\n\n2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:04.200\n that it would be possible for a technological civilization\n\n2:35:04.200 --> 2:35:07.360\n to produce more than a billion black holes\n\n2:35:07.360 --> 2:35:09.920\n with the energy and matter at their disposal.\n\n2:35:09.920 --> 2:35:12.640\n And so one of the calculations in that paper,\n\n2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:14.000\n back of the envelope,\n\n2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.320\n but I think revealing nonetheless is that\n\n2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:20.720\n if you take a relatively common asteroid,\n\n2:35:20.720 --> 2:35:23.640\n something that's about a kilometer in diameter,\n\n2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:26.680\n what I'm thinking of is just scrap material\n\n2:35:26.680 --> 2:35:28.960\n laying around in our solar system\n\n2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:31.360\n and break it up into 10 kilogram chunks\n\n2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:33.320\n and turn each of those into a universe,\n\n2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:38.080\n then you would have made at least a trillion black holes\n\n2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:41.480\n outpacing the star production rate\n\n2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:43.320\n by some three orders of magnitude.\n\n2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:44.760\n That's one asteroid.\n\n2:35:44.760 --> 2:35:46.840\n So now if you envision an intelligent species\n\n2:35:46.840 --> 2:35:50.920\n that would potentially have been devised initially\n\n2:35:50.920 --> 2:35:53.120\n by humans, but then based on superconducting\n\n2:35:53.120 --> 2:35:55.160\n optoelectronic networks, no doubt,\n\n2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:57.080\n and they go out and populate,\n\n2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:58.920\n they don't have to fill the galaxy.\n\n2:35:58.920 --> 2:36:01.640\n They just have to get out to the asteroid belt.\n\n2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:05.240\n They could potentially dramatically outpace\n\n2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:07.840\n the rate at which stars are producing offspring universes.\n\n2:36:07.840 --> 2:36:10.600\n And then wouldn't you expect that\n\n2:36:10.600 --> 2:36:13.080\n that's where we came from instead of a star?\n\n2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:16.520\n Yeah, so you have to somehow become masters of gravity,\n\n2:36:16.520 --> 2:36:17.360\n so like, or generate.\n\n2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:18.680\n John, this is really gravity.\n\n2:36:18.680 --> 2:36:20.600\n So stars make black holes with gravity,\n\n2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:25.600\n but any force that can make the energy density\n\n2:36:26.160 --> 2:36:28.320\n can compactify matter to produce\n\n2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:31.120\n a great enough energy density can form a singularity.\n\n2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:33.480\n It doesn't, it would not likely be gravity.\n\n2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:34.480\n It's the weakest force.\n\n2:36:34.480 --> 2:36:38.480\n You're more likely to use something like the technologies\n\n2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:40.480\n that we're developing for fusion, for example.\n\n2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:44.240\n So I don't know, the Large Ignition Facility\n\n2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:49.240\n recently blasted a pellet with 100 really bright lasers\n\n2:36:50.520 --> 2:36:53.360\n and caused that to get dense enough\n\n2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:55.280\n to engage in nuclear fusion.\n\n2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:56.560\n So something more like that,\n\n2:36:56.560 --> 2:36:59.200\n or a tokamak with a really hot plasma, I'm not sure.\n\n2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:02.160\n Something, I don't know exactly how it would be done.\n\n2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:04.560\n I do like the idea of that,\n\n2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:07.120\n especially just been reading a lot about gravitational waves\n\n2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:10.600\n and the fact that us humans with our technological\n\n2:37:10.600 --> 2:37:13.160\n capabilities, one of the most impressive\n\n2:37:14.120 --> 2:37:17.360\n technological accomplishments of human history is LIGO,\n\n2:37:17.360 --> 2:37:20.720\n being able to precisely detect gravitational waves.\n\n2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.000\n I'm particularly find appealing the idea\n\n2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:29.520\n that other alien civilizations from very far distances\n\n2:37:29.520 --> 2:37:34.360\n communicate with gravity, with gravitational waves,\n\n2:37:34.360 --> 2:37:37.800\n because as you become greater and greater master of gravity,\n\n2:37:37.800 --> 2:37:40.600\n which seems way out of reach for us right now,\n\n2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:44.280\n maybe that seems like a effective way of sending signals,\n\n2:37:44.280 --> 2:37:48.440\n especially if your job is to manufacture black holes.\n\n2:37:48.440 --> 2:37:49.280\n Right.\n\n2:37:49.280 --> 2:37:51.840\n So that, so let me ask there,\n\n2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:56.440\n whatever, I mean, broadly thinking,\n\n2:37:56.440 --> 2:37:58.920\n because we tend to think other alien civilizations\n\n2:37:58.920 --> 2:38:00.000\n would be very human like,\n\n2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:04.080\n but if we think of alien civilizations out there\n\n2:38:04.080 --> 2:38:06.640\n as basically generators of black holes,\n\n2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:10.040\n however they do it, because they got stars,\n\n2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:12.800\n do you think there's a lot of them\n\n2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:15.760\n in our particular universe out there?\n\n2:38:17.760 --> 2:38:19.200\n In our universe?\n\n2:38:20.480 --> 2:38:23.400\n Well, okay, let me ask, okay, this is great.\n\n2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:26.680\n Let me ask a very generic question\n\n2:38:26.680 --> 2:38:29.200\n and then let's see how you answer it,\n\n2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:34.120\n which is how many alien civilizations are out there?\n\n2:38:35.080 --> 2:38:38.400\n If the hypothesis that I just described\n\n2:38:38.400 --> 2:38:40.840\n is on the right track,\n\n2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:43.880\n it would mean that the parameters of our universe\n\n2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:48.480\n have been selected so that intelligent civilizations\n\n2:38:48.480 --> 2:38:50.240\n will occur in sufficient numbers\n\n2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:54.720\n so that if they reach something\n\n2:38:54.720 --> 2:38:56.480\n like supreme technological maturity,\n\n2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:00.080\n let's define that as the ability to produce black holes,\n\n2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:02.640\n then that's not a highly improbable event.\n\n2:39:02.640 --> 2:39:05.440\n It doesn't need to happen often\n\n2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:06.680\n because as I just described,\n\n2:39:06.680 --> 2:39:09.200\n if you get one of them in a galaxy,\n\n2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:10.520\n you're gonna make more black holes\n\n2:39:10.520 --> 2:39:12.720\n than the stars in that galaxy.\n\n2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:16.560\n But there's also not a super strong motivation,\n\n2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:21.560\n well, it's not obvious that you need them\n\n2:39:21.600 --> 2:39:23.920\n to be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.\n\n2:39:23.920 --> 2:39:24.760\n Right.\n\n2:39:24.760 --> 2:39:27.520\n One of the things that I try to emphasize in that paper\n\n2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:30.640\n is that given this idea\n\n2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:35.120\n of how our parameters might've been selected,\n\n2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:39.280\n it's clear that it's a series of trade offs, right?\n\n2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:42.040\n If you make, I mean, in order for intelligent life\n\n2:39:42.040 --> 2:39:45.760\n of our variety or anything resembling us to occur,\n\n2:39:45.760 --> 2:39:47.600\n you need a bunch of stuff, you need stars.\n\n2:39:47.600 --> 2:39:51.080\n So that's right back to Smolin's roots of this idea,\n\n2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:54.440\n but you also need water to have certain properties.\n\n2:39:54.440 --> 2:39:58.760\n You need things like the rocky planets,\n\n2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:00.600\n like the Earth to be within the habitable zone,\n\n2:40:00.600 --> 2:40:02.680\n all these things that you start talking about\n\n2:40:02.680 --> 2:40:06.760\n in the field of astrobiology,\n\n2:40:06.760 --> 2:40:08.800\n trying to understand life in the universe,\n\n2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:10.480\n but you can't over emphasize,\n\n2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:13.600\n you can't tune the parameters so precisely\n\n2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:15.160\n to maximize the number of stars\n\n2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:18.960\n or to give water exactly the properties\n\n2:40:18.960 --> 2:40:22.280\n or to make rocky planets like Earth the most numerous.\n\n2:40:22.280 --> 2:40:24.480\n You have to compromise on all these things.\n\n2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:27.360\n And so I think the way to test this idea\n\n2:40:27.360 --> 2:40:30.240\n is to look at what parameters are necessary\n\n2:40:30.240 --> 2:40:32.760\n for each of these different subsystems,\n\n2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:35.080\n and I've laid out a few that I think are promising,\n\n2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:36.640\n there could be countless others,\n\n2:40:36.640 --> 2:40:40.840\n and see how changing the parameters\n\n2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:43.600\n makes it more or less likely that stars would form\n\n2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:46.320\n and have long lifetimes or that rocky planets\n\n2:40:46.320 --> 2:40:48.280\n in the habitable zone are likely to form,\n\n2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:49.400\n all these different things.\n\n2:40:49.400 --> 2:40:53.360\n So we can test how much these things are in a tug of war\n\n2:40:53.360 --> 2:40:56.280\n with each other, and the prediction would be\n\n2:40:56.280 --> 2:40:58.160\n that we kind of sit at this central point\n\n2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.040\n where if you move the parameters too much,\n\n2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:05.680\n stars aren't stable, or life doesn't form,\n\n2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:07.720\n or technology's infeasible,\n\n2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:10.760\n because life alone, at least the kind of life\n\n2:41:10.760 --> 2:41:14.160\n that we know of, cannot make black holes.\n\n2:41:14.160 --> 2:41:16.400\n We don't have this, well, I'm speaking for myself,\n\n2:41:16.400 --> 2:41:18.560\n you're a very fit and strong person,\n\n2:41:18.560 --> 2:41:20.600\n but it might be possible for you,\n\n2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:22.360\n but not for me to compress matter.\n\n2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:25.960\n So we need these technologies, but we don't know,\n\n2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:28.960\n we have not been able to quantify yet\n\n2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:33.840\n how finely adjusted the parameters would need to be\n\n2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:35.600\n in order for silicon to have the properties it does.\n\n2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:37.840\n Okay, this is not directly speaking to what you're saying,\n\n2:41:37.840 --> 2:41:39.520\n you're getting to the Fermi paradox,\n\n2:41:39.520 --> 2:41:42.840\n which is where are they, where are the life forms out there,\n\n2:41:42.840 --> 2:41:44.560\n how numerous are they, that sort of thing.\n\n2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:46.200\n What I'm trying to argue is that\n\n2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:50.800\n if this framework is on the right track,\n\n2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:53.720\n a potentially correct explanation for our existence,\n\n2:41:53.720 --> 2:41:56.320\n we, it doesn't necessarily predict\n\n2:41:56.320 --> 2:41:59.280\n that intelligent civilizations are just everywhere,\n\n2:41:59.280 --> 2:42:02.520\n because even if you just get one of them in a galaxy,\n\n2:42:02.520 --> 2:42:05.760\n which is quite rare, it could be enough\n\n2:42:05.760 --> 2:42:08.920\n to dramatically increase the fecundity\n\n2:42:08.920 --> 2:42:10.160\n of the universe as a whole.\n\n2:42:10.160 --> 2:42:12.440\n Yeah, and I wonder, once you start generating\n\n2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:15.400\n the offspring for universes, black holes,\n\n2:42:15.400 --> 2:42:18.360\n how that has effect on the,\n\n2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:19.920\n what kind of effect does it have\n\n2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:24.920\n on the other candidate's civilizations\n\n2:42:24.920 --> 2:42:26.160\n within that universe?\n\n2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:28.400\n Maybe it has a destructive aspect,\n\n2:42:28.400 --> 2:42:29.840\n or there could be some arguments\n\n2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:32.040\n about once you have a lot of offspring,\n\n2:42:32.040 --> 2:42:34.040\n that that just quickly accelerates\n\n2:42:34.040 --> 2:42:35.760\n to where the other ones can't even catch up.\n\n2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:39.160\n It could, but I guess if you want me\n\n2:42:39.160 --> 2:42:42.520\n to put my chips on the table or whatever,\n\n2:42:42.520 --> 2:42:45.360\n I think I come down more on the side\n\n2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:51.320\n that intelligent life civilizations are rare.\n\n2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:57.160\n And I guess I follow Max Tegmark here.\n\n2:42:57.160 --> 2:43:01.000\n And also there's a lot of papers coming out recently\n\n2:43:01.000 --> 2:43:04.360\n in the field of astrobiology that are seeming to say,\n\n2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:06.000\n all right, you just work through the numbers\n\n2:43:06.000 --> 2:43:09.680\n on some modified Drake equation or something like that.\n\n2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:13.040\n And it looks like it's not improbable.\n\n2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:16.280\n You shouldn't be surprised that an intelligent species\n\n2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:18.040\n has arisen in our galaxy,\n\n2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:20.360\n but if you think there's one the next solar system over,\n\n2:43:20.360 --> 2:43:21.600\n it's highly improbable.\n\n2:43:21.600 --> 2:43:23.960\n So I can see that the number,\n\n2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:28.280\n the probability of finding a civilization in a galaxy,\n\n2:43:28.280 --> 2:43:31.080\n maybe it's most likely that you're gonna find\n\n2:43:31.080 --> 2:43:32.880\n one to a hundred or something.\n\n2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:34.960\n But okay, now it's really important\n\n2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:36.720\n to put a time window on that, I think,\n\n2:43:36.720 --> 2:43:40.720\n because does that mean in the entire lifetime of the galaxy\n\n2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:45.720\n before it, so for in our case, before we run into Andromeda,\n\n2:43:49.760 --> 2:43:52.960\n I think it's highly probable, I shouldn't say I think,\n\n2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:56.760\n it's tempting to believe that it's highly probable\n\n2:43:56.760 --> 2:44:00.000\n that in that entire lifetime of your galaxy,\n\n2:44:00.000 --> 2:44:02.600\n you're gonna get at least one intelligent species,\n\n2:44:02.600 --> 2:44:05.160\n maybe thousands or something like that.\n\n2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:10.160\n But it's also, I think, a little bit naive to think\n\n2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:13.200\n that they're going to coincide in time\n\n2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:14.960\n and we'll be able to observe them.\n\n2:44:14.960 --> 2:44:19.960\n And also, if you look at the span of life on Earth,\n\n2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:24.480\n the Earth history, it was surprising to me\n\n2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:27.880\n to kind of look at the amount of time,\n\n2:44:27.880 --> 2:44:29.680\n first of all, the short amount of time,\n\n2:44:29.680 --> 2:44:31.520\n there's no life, it's surprising.\n\n2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:33.440\n Life sprang up pretty quickly.\n\n2:44:33.440 --> 2:44:35.280\n It's single cell.\n\n2:44:35.280 --> 2:44:36.960\n But that's the point I'm trying to make\n\n2:44:36.960 --> 2:44:41.960\n is like so much of life on Earth\n\n2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:45.840\n was just like single cell organisms, like most of it.\n\n2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:48.640\n Most of it was like boring bacteria type of stuff.\n\n2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:50.640\n Well, bacteria are fascinating, but I take your point.\n\n2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:51.520\n No, I get it.\n\n2:44:51.520 --> 2:44:52.880\n I mean, no offense to them.\n\n2:44:52.880 --> 2:44:56.840\n But this kind of speaking from the perspective\n\n2:44:56.840 --> 2:44:58.720\n of your paper of something that's able\n\n2:44:58.720 --> 2:45:01.440\n to generate technology as we kind of understand it,\n\n2:45:01.440 --> 2:45:03.400\n that's a very short moment in time\n\n2:45:03.400 --> 2:45:08.400\n relative to that full history of life on Earth.\n\n2:45:08.640 --> 2:45:12.200\n And maybe our universe is just saturated\n\n2:45:12.200 --> 2:45:15.880\n with bacteria like humans.\n\n2:45:15.880 --> 2:45:17.480\n Right.\n\n2:45:17.480 --> 2:45:22.480\n But not the special extra AGI super humans,\n\n2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:25.560\n that those are very rare.\n\n2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:30.400\n And once those spring up, everything just goes to like,\n\n2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:33.360\n it accelerates very quickly.\n\n2:45:33.360 --> 2:45:36.520\n Yeah, we just don't have enough data to really say,\n\n2:45:36.520 --> 2:45:40.000\n but I find this whole subject extremely engaging.\n\n2:45:40.000 --> 2:45:41.680\n I mean, there's this concept,\n\n2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:43.880\n I think it's called the Rare Earth Hypothesis,\n\n2:45:43.880 --> 2:45:46.920\n which is that basically stating that,\n\n2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:49.040\n okay, microbes were here right away\n\n2:45:49.040 --> 2:45:52.120\n after the Hadian era where we were being bombarded.\n\n2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:54.920\n Well, after, yeah, bombarded by comets, asteroids,\n\n2:45:54.920 --> 2:45:57.080\n things like that, and also after the moon formed.\n\n2:45:57.080 --> 2:45:59.560\n So once things settled down a little bit,\n\n2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:02.280\n in a few hundred million years,\n\n2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:03.680\n you have microbes everywhere.\n\n2:46:03.680 --> 2:46:05.200\n And it could have been, we don't know exactly\n\n2:46:05.200 --> 2:46:08.080\n when it could have been remarkably brief that that took.\n\n2:46:08.080 --> 2:46:10.200\n So it does indicate that, okay,\n\n2:46:10.200 --> 2:46:12.160\n life forms relatively easily.\n\n2:46:12.160 --> 2:46:15.920\n I think that alone is sort of a checker on the scale\n\n2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:20.920\n for the argument that the parameters that allow\n\n2:46:21.480 --> 2:46:24.360\n even microbial life to form are not just a fluke.\n\n2:46:24.360 --> 2:46:27.520\n But anyway, that aside, yes,\n\n2:46:27.520 --> 2:46:29.880\n then there was this long dormant period,\n\n2:46:29.880 --> 2:46:31.600\n not dormant, things were happening,\n\n2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:34.120\n but important things were happening\n\n2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:37.320\n for some two and a half billion years or something\n\n2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:40.160\n after the metabolic process\n\n2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:42.840\n that releases oxygen was developed.\n\n2:46:42.840 --> 2:46:46.120\n Then basically the planet's just sitting there,\n\n2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:47.560\n getting more and more oxygenated,\n\n2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:50.200\n more and more oxygenated until it's enough\n\n2:46:50.200 --> 2:46:54.160\n that you can build these large, complex organisms.\n\n2:46:54.160 --> 2:46:56.480\n And so the Rare Earth Hypothesis would argue\n\n2:46:56.480 --> 2:47:01.000\n that the microbes are common everywhere\n\n2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:04.160\n in any planet that's roughly in the habitable zone\n\n2:47:04.160 --> 2:47:06.640\n and has some water on it, it's probably gonna have those.\n\n2:47:06.640 --> 2:47:09.320\n But then getting to this Cambrian explosion\n\n2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:13.760\n that happened some between 500 and 600 million years ago,\n\n2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:16.360\n that's rare, you know?\n\n2:47:16.360 --> 2:47:19.080\n And I buy that, I think that is rare.\n\n2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:21.880\n So if you say how much life is in our galaxy,\n\n2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:24.120\n I think that's probably the right answer\n\n2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:26.440\n is that microbes are everywhere.\n\n2:47:26.440 --> 2:47:29.360\n Cambrian explosion is extremely rare.\n\n2:47:29.360 --> 2:47:32.760\n And then, but the Cambrian explosion kind of went like that\n\n2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:37.760\n where within a couple of tens or a hundred million years,\n\n2:47:38.600 --> 2:47:40.960\n all of these body plans came into existence.\n\n2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:43.120\n And basically all of the body plans\n\n2:47:43.120 --> 2:47:46.080\n that are now in existence on the planet\n\n2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:48.720\n were formed in that brief window\n\n2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:51.640\n and we've just been shuffling around since then.\n\n2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:54.840\n So then what caused humans to pop out of that?\n\n2:47:54.840 --> 2:47:59.840\n I mean, that could be another extremely rare threshold\n\n2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:06.200\n that a planet roughly in the habitable zone with water\n\n2:48:06.200 --> 2:48:08.400\n is not guaranteed to cross, you know?\n\n2:48:08.400 --> 2:48:10.200\n To me, it's fascinating for being humble,\n\n2:48:10.200 --> 2:48:13.080\n like the humans cannot possibly be the most amazing thing\n\n2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.880\n that such, if you look at the entirety of the system\n\n2:48:15.880 --> 2:48:17.800\n that Lee Smolin and you paint,\n\n2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:20.080\n that cannot possibly be the most amazing thing\n\n2:48:20.080 --> 2:48:21.480\n that process generates.\n\n2:48:21.480 --> 2:48:23.720\n So like, if you look at the evolution,\n\n2:48:23.720 --> 2:48:27.040\n what's the equivalent in the cosmological evolution\n\n2:48:27.040 --> 2:48:29.000\n and its selection for technology,\n\n2:48:29.000 --> 2:48:32.440\n the equivalent of the human eye or the human brain?\n\n2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:35.600\n Universes that are able to do some like,\n\n2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:37.760\n they don't need the damn stars.\n\n2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:42.120\n They're able to just do some incredible generation\n\n2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:46.640\n of complexity fast, like much more than,\n\n2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:47.520\n if you think about it,\n\n2:48:47.520 --> 2:48:50.920\n it's like most of our universe is pretty freaking boring.\n\n2:48:50.920 --> 2:48:53.400\n There's not much going on, there's a few rocks flying around\n\n2:48:53.400 --> 2:48:54.520\n and there's some like apes\n\n2:48:54.520 --> 2:48:59.520\n that are just like doing podcasts on some weird planet.\n\n2:49:00.520 --> 2:49:02.840\n It just seems very inefficient.\n\n2:49:02.840 --> 2:49:05.960\n If you think about like the amazing thing in the human eye,\n\n2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.440\n the visual cortex can do, the brain, the nervous,\n\n2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:12.840\n everything that makes us more powerful\n\n2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:15.480\n than single cell organisms.\n\n2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:19.320\n Like if there's an equivalent of that for universes,\n\n2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:21.680\n like the richness of physics\n\n2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:24.640\n that could be expressed\n\n2:49:24.640 --> 2:49:26.840\n through a particular set of parameters.\n\n2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:31.040\n Like, I mean, like for me,\n\n2:49:31.040 --> 2:49:33.760\n I'm a sort of from a computer science perspective,\n\n2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:35.600\n huge fan of cellular automata,\n\n2:49:35.600 --> 2:49:39.320\n which is a nice sort of pretty visual way\n\n2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:42.160\n to illustrate how different laws\n\n2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:46.400\n can result in drastically different levels of complexity.\n\n2:49:46.400 --> 2:49:49.000\n So like, it's like, yeah, okay.\n\n2:49:49.000 --> 2:49:50.320\n So we're all like celebrating,\n\n2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:52.120\n look, our little cellular automata\n\n2:49:52.120 --> 2:49:54.560\n is able to generate pretty triangles and squares\n\n2:49:54.560 --> 2:49:57.600\n and therefore we achieve general intelligence.\n\n2:49:57.600 --> 2:50:01.840\n And then there'll be like some badass Chuck Norris type,\n\n2:50:01.840 --> 2:50:06.560\n like universal Turing machine type of cellular automata.\n\n2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:09.560\n They're able to generate other cellular automata\n\n2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:13.120\n that does any arbitrary level of computation off the bat.\n\n2:50:14.160 --> 2:50:16.480\n Like those have to then exist.\n\n2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:19.840\n And then we're just like, we'll be forgotten.\n\n2:50:19.840 --> 2:50:23.800\n This story, this podcast just entertains\n\n2:50:23.800 --> 2:50:26.880\n a few other apes for a few months.\n\n2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:30.240\n Well, I'm kind of surprised to hear your cynicism.\n\n2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:32.080\n No, I'm very up.\n\n2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:36.120\n I usually think of you as like one who celebrates humanity\n\n2:50:36.120 --> 2:50:37.600\n and all its forms and things like that.\n\n2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:39.240\n And I guess I just, I don't,\n\n2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:41.000\n I see it the way you just described.\n\n2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:44.520\n I mean, okay, we've been here for 13.7 billion years\n\n2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:47.240\n and you're saying, gosh, that's a long time.\n\n2:50:47.240 --> 2:50:48.480\n Let's get on with the show already.\n\n2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:51.520\n Some other universe could have kicked our butt by now,\n\n2:50:51.520 --> 2:50:55.360\n but that's putting a characteristic time.\n\n2:50:55.360 --> 2:50:58.400\n I mean, why is 13.7 billion a long time?\n\n2:50:58.400 --> 2:51:00.440\n I mean, compared to what?\n\n2:51:00.440 --> 2:51:02.320\n I guess, so when I look at our universe,\n\n2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:05.400\n I see this extraordinary hierarchy\n\n2:51:05.400 --> 2:51:08.080\n that has developed over that time.\n\n2:51:08.080 --> 2:51:13.080\n So at the beginning, it was a chaotic mess of some plasma\n\n2:51:13.720 --> 2:51:16.080\n and nothing interesting going on there.\n\n2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:18.880\n And even for the first stars to form,\n\n2:51:18.880 --> 2:51:23.880\n that a lot of really interesting evolutionary processes\n\n2:51:23.880 --> 2:51:26.240\n had to occur, by evolutionary in that sense,\n\n2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:30.520\n I just mean taking place over extended periods of time\n\n2:51:30.520 --> 2:51:32.000\n and structures are forming then.\n\n2:51:32.000 --> 2:51:34.640\n And then it took that first generation of stars\n\n2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:37.480\n in order to produce the metals\n\n2:51:38.760 --> 2:51:41.280\n that then can more efficiently produce\n\n2:51:41.280 --> 2:51:42.440\n another generation of stars.\n\n2:51:42.440 --> 2:51:44.720\n We're only the third generation of stars.\n\n2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:47.920\n So we might still be pretty quick to the game here.\n\n2:51:47.920 --> 2:51:51.000\n So, but I don't think, I don't, okay.\n\n2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:52.440\n So then you have these stars\n\n2:51:52.440 --> 2:51:54.640\n and then you have solar systems on those solar systems.\n\n2:51:54.640 --> 2:51:58.840\n You have rocky worlds, you have gas giants,\n\n2:51:58.840 --> 2:51:59.800\n like all this complexity.\n\n2:51:59.800 --> 2:52:01.120\n And then you start getting life\n\n2:52:01.120 --> 2:52:03.800\n and the complexity that's evolved\n\n2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:06.440\n through the evolutionary process in life forms\n\n2:52:06.440 --> 2:52:09.880\n is just, it's not a let down to me.\n\n2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:10.720\n Just seeing that.\n\n2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:14.600\n Some of it is like some of the planets is like icy,\n\n2:52:14.600 --> 2:52:16.080\n it's like different flavors of ice cream.\n\n2:52:16.080 --> 2:52:18.560\n They're icy, but there might be water underneath.\n\n2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:21.120\n All kinds of life forms with some volcanoes,\n\n2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:22.320\n all kinds of weird stuff.\n\n2:52:22.320 --> 2:52:24.600\n No, no, I don't, I think it's beautiful.\n\n2:52:24.600 --> 2:52:25.960\n I think our life is beautiful.\n\n2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:29.560\n And I think it was designed that by design,\n\n2:52:29.560 --> 2:52:31.200\n the scarcity of the whole thing.\n\n2:52:31.200 --> 2:52:33.840\n I think mortality, as terrifying as it is,\n\n2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:37.280\n is fundamental to the whole reason we enjoy everything.\n\n2:52:37.280 --> 2:52:38.200\n No, I think it's beautiful.\n\n2:52:38.200 --> 2:52:42.400\n I just think that all of us conscious beings\n\n2:52:42.400 --> 2:52:45.520\n in the grand scheme of basically every scale\n\n2:52:45.520 --> 2:52:46.960\n will be completely forgotten.\n\n2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:47.800\n Well, that's true.\n\n2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:49.320\n I think everything is transient\n\n2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:52.520\n and that would go back to maybe something more like Lao Tzu,\n\n2:52:52.520 --> 2:52:55.440\n the Tao Te Ching or something where it's like,\n\n2:52:55.440 --> 2:52:57.720\n yes, there is nothing but change.\n\n2:52:57.720 --> 2:53:00.720\n There is nothing but emergence and dissolve and that's it.\n\n2:53:00.720 --> 2:53:03.000\n But I just, in this picture,\n\n2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:04.520\n this hierarchy that's developed,\n\n2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:06.600\n I don't mean to say that now it gets to us\n\n2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:07.440\n and that's the pinnacle.\n\n2:53:07.440 --> 2:53:10.520\n In fact, I think at a high level,\n\n2:53:10.520 --> 2:53:14.240\n the story I'm trying to tease out in my research is about,\n\n2:53:14.240 --> 2:53:17.000\n okay, well, so then what's the next level of hierarchy?\n\n2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:21.520\n And if it's, okay, we're kind of pretty smart.\n\n2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:23.840\n I mean, talking about people like Lee Small\n\n2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:26.240\n and Alan Guth, Max Tegmark, okay, we're really smart.\n\n2:53:26.240 --> 2:53:28.480\n Talking about me, okay, we're kind of,\n\n2:53:28.480 --> 2:53:30.760\n we can find our way to the grocery store or whatever,\n\n2:53:30.760 --> 2:53:33.000\n but what's next?\n\n2:53:33.000 --> 2:53:36.120\n I mean, what if there's another level of hierarchy\n\n2:53:36.120 --> 2:53:37.760\n that grows on top of us\n\n2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:40.280\n that is even more profoundly capable?\n\n2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:42.080\n And I mean, we've talked a lot\n\n2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:43.560\n about superconducting sensors.\n\n2:53:43.560 --> 2:53:48.560\n Imagine these cognitive systems far more capable than us\n\n2:53:48.920 --> 2:53:52.320\n residing somewhere else in the solar system\n\n2:53:52.320 --> 2:53:53.640\n off of the surface of the earth,\n\n2:53:53.640 --> 2:53:55.400\n where it's much darker, much colder,\n\n2:53:55.400 --> 2:53:57.080\n much more naturally suited to them.\n\n2:53:57.080 --> 2:54:00.440\n And they have these sensors that can detect single photons\n\n2:54:00.440 --> 2:54:04.560\n of light from radio waves out to all across the spectrum\n\n2:54:04.560 --> 2:54:07.400\n of the gamma rays and just see the whole universe.\n\n2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:08.960\n And they just live in space\n\n2:54:08.960 --> 2:54:12.960\n with these massive collection optics so that they,\n\n2:54:12.960 --> 2:54:13.800\n what do they do?\n\n2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:18.800\n They just look out and experience that vast array\n\n2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:22.520\n of what's being developed.\n\n2:54:22.520 --> 2:54:24.240\n And if you're such a system,\n\n2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:28.920\n presumably you would do some things for fun.\n\n2:54:28.920 --> 2:54:31.720\n And the kind of fun thing I would do\n\n2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:33.840\n as somebody who likes video games\n\n2:54:33.840 --> 2:54:37.040\n is I would create and maintain\n\n2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:39.340\n and observe something like earth.\n\n2:54:42.760 --> 2:54:47.320\n So in some sense, we're like all what players on a stage\n\n2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:52.320\n for this superconducting cold computing system out there.\n\n2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:56.680\n I mean, all of this is fascinating to think.\n\n2:54:56.680 --> 2:54:59.360\n The fact that you're actually designing systems\n\n2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:01.560\n here on earth that are trying to push this technological\n\n2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:04.800\n at the very cutting edge and also thinking about\n\n2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:09.760\n how does the like the evolution of physical laws\n\n2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:14.240\n lead us to the way we are is fascinating.\n\n2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:15.920\n That coupling is fascinating.\n\n2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:20.800\n It's like the ultimate rigorous application of philosophy\n\n2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:23.680\n to the rigorous application of engineering.\n\n2:55:23.680 --> 2:55:26.400\n So Jeff, you're one of the most fascinating.\n\n2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:29.000\n I'm so glad I did not know much about you\n\n2:55:29.000 --> 2:55:30.440\n except through your work.\n\n2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:34.200\n And I'm so glad we got this chance to talk.\n\n2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:37.800\n You're one of the best explainers\n\n2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:39.820\n of exceptionally difficult concepts.\n\n2:55:40.940 --> 2:55:44.600\n And you're also, speaking of like fractal,\n\n2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:46.680\n you're able to function intellectually\n\n2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:50.240\n at all levels of the stack, which I deeply appreciate.\n\n2:55:50.240 --> 2:55:51.640\n This was really fun.\n\n2:55:51.640 --> 2:55:53.600\n You're a great educator, a great scientist.\n\n2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:56.080\n It's an honor that you would spend\n\n2:55:56.080 --> 2:55:57.280\n your valuable time with me.\n\n2:55:57.280 --> 2:56:00.120\n It's an honor that you would spend your time with me as well.\n\n2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:01.760\n Thanks, Jeff.\n\n2:56:01.760 --> 2:56:03.560\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:56:03.560 --> 2:56:05.240\n with Jeff Schoenlein.\n\n2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:06.680\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:56:06.680 --> 2:56:09.580\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:56:09.580 --> 2:56:12.060\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:56:12.060 --> 2:56:14.320\n from the great John Carmack,\n\n2:56:14.320 --> 2:56:17.300\n who surely will be a guest on this podcast soon.\n\n2:56:18.220 --> 2:56:20.100\n Because of the nature of Moore's Law,\n\n2:56:20.100 --> 2:56:22.800\n anything that an extremely clever graphics programmer\n\n2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:26.040\n can do at one point can be replicated\n\n2:56:26.040 --> 2:56:27.920\n by a merely competent programmer\n\n2:56:27.920 --> 2:56:30.520\n some number of years later.\n\n2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:59.520\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
