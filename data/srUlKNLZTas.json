  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:01.660\n I mean, I've definitely experienced moments\n\n00:01.660 --> 00:05.460\n where I didn't want to do anything but chess.\n\n00:05.460 --> 00:07.040\n I'd also say that's pretty universal.\n\n00:07.040 --> 00:09.400\n I think if you want to be the best at anything you do\n\n00:09.400 --> 00:12.040\n or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.\n\n00:13.880 --> 00:15.160\n The following is a conversation\n\n00:15.160 --> 00:17.480\n with Alexandra and Andrea Botez.\n\n00:17.480 --> 00:20.100\n They're sisters, professional chess players,\n\n00:20.100 --> 00:23.900\n commentators, educators, entertainers, and streamers.\n\n00:23.900 --> 00:28.120\n Their channel is called Botez Live on Twitch and YouTube.\n\n00:28.120 --> 00:29.920\n I highly recommend you check it out.\n\n00:30.840 --> 00:33.640\n A small side note about the currently ongoing controversy\n\n00:33.640 --> 00:36.560\n in the chess world, where the 19 year old grandmaster,\n\n00:36.560 --> 00:40.960\n Hans Niemann, beat Magnus Carlsen at the Sink Field Cup.\n\n00:40.960 --> 00:43.960\n After this, Magnus, for the first time ever,\n\n00:43.960 --> 00:46.720\n withdrew from the tournament, implying with a tweet\n\n00:46.720 --> 00:48.380\n that there may have been cheating\n\n00:48.380 --> 00:50.840\n or at least something shady going on.\n\n00:50.840 --> 00:53.600\n Folks like the grandmaster, Hikaru Nakamura,\n\n00:53.600 --> 00:56.120\n fanned the flames of cheating accusations,\n\n00:56.120 --> 00:59.320\n and the internet made a bunch of proposals\n\n00:59.320 --> 01:01.380\n on how the cheating could have been done,\n\n01:01.380 --> 01:05.020\n and it ranged from the ridiculous to the hilarious,\n\n01:05.020 --> 01:06.000\n often both.\n\n01:06.840 --> 01:10.520\n Hans himself came out and said that he has cheated before\n\n01:10.520 --> 01:14.480\n when he was 12 and 16 on random online games\n\n01:14.480 --> 01:16.420\n to jack up his rating.\n\n01:16.420 --> 01:19.920\n But he said that he has never cheated in person\n\n01:19.920 --> 01:21.240\n over the board.\n\n01:21.240 --> 01:24.240\n Danny Wrench from chess.com, who I've spoken with,\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:27.680\n may make a statement in response to Hans's claims soon.\n\n01:28.580 --> 01:30.800\n Folks like grandmaster Jakob Luegge\n\n01:30.800 --> 01:32.920\n spoke to his experience training Hans Niemann\n\n01:32.920 --> 01:36.240\n and has said that his memory and intuition\n\n01:36.240 --> 01:38.040\n were quite brilliant.\n\n01:38.040 --> 01:40.500\n So as you see, there's a lot of perspectives on this.\n\n01:40.500 --> 01:42.680\n ChessBase has a good summary of the saga\n\n01:42.680 --> 01:45.120\n that I'll link in the description.\n\n01:45.120 --> 01:48.020\n Also note that this is so quickly moving\n\n01:48.020 --> 01:50.620\n that new stuff might come out between me recording this\n\n01:50.620 --> 01:52.320\n and publishing the episode,\n\n01:52.320 --> 01:53.720\n but I thought I'd mention this anyway\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:56.360\n since the episode with the Botas sisters\n\n01:56.360 --> 01:58.400\n is a conversation about chess\n\n01:58.400 --> 02:01.200\n and was recorded shortly before the controversy,\n\n02:01.200 --> 02:02.680\n so we didn't talk about it.\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:06.920\n I'm considering having Hans on this podcast\n\n02:06.920 --> 02:09.360\n and also Magnus back on the podcast,\n\n02:09.360 --> 02:11.480\n and maybe others like Hikaru\n\n02:11.480 --> 02:14.880\n or folks from chess.com's anti cheat staff\n\n02:14.880 --> 02:16.460\n to discuss their really interesting\n\n02:16.460 --> 02:18.660\n cheating detection algorithms,\n\n02:18.660 --> 02:21.800\n but I may also just stay out of it.\n\n02:21.800 --> 02:24.080\n I find chess to be a beautiful game\n\n02:24.080 --> 02:25.440\n and the chess community\n\n02:25.440 --> 02:28.040\n full of fascinating, brilliant people,\n\n02:28.040 --> 02:30.320\n and so I'll keep having conversations like these\n\n02:30.320 --> 02:31.520\n about chess.\n\n02:31.520 --> 02:32.800\n It's fun.\n\n02:32.800 --> 02:36.880\n My goal with this podcast and in general as a human being\n\n02:36.880 --> 02:39.960\n is to increase the amount of love in the world.\n\n02:39.960 --> 02:43.000\n Sometimes that involves celebrating brilliance and beauty\n\n02:43.000 --> 02:46.280\n in science, in art, in chess.\n\n02:46.280 --> 02:48.620\n Sometimes it involves empathetic conversations\n\n02:48.620 --> 02:52.120\n with controversial figures that seek to understand,\n\n02:52.120 --> 02:53.880\n not to ride.\n\n02:53.880 --> 02:56.120\n Sometimes it involves standing against\n\n02:56.120 --> 02:57.880\n the internet lynch mob,\n\n02:57.880 --> 03:00.120\n as the ChessBase article calls it,\n\n03:00.120 --> 03:03.920\n to hear the story of a human being who is under attack,\n\n03:03.920 --> 03:07.160\n even if it means I get attacked in the process as well.\n\n03:08.000 --> 03:09.920\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n03:09.920 --> 03:12.420\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n03:12.420 --> 03:13.560\n in the description,\n\n03:13.560 --> 03:14.760\n and now, dear friends,\n\n03:14.760 --> 03:19.000\n here's Alexandra and Andrea Botas.\n\n03:19.000 --> 03:20.920\n You just got back from Italy.\n\n03:20.920 --> 03:22.640\n What's the most memorable thing?\n\n03:22.640 --> 03:24.100\n I was just there recently as well.\n\n03:24.100 --> 03:28.000\n It was very chaotic because we went out on a whim\n\n03:28.000 --> 03:30.920\n and we only had our first hotel booked,\n\n03:30.920 --> 03:33.920\n and then we rented a car and drove around all of the cities\n\n03:33.920 --> 03:35.580\n and went to like five different cities\n\n03:35.580 --> 03:37.680\n in about a week and a bit.\n\n03:37.680 --> 03:39.340\n So I think it was just the variety\n\n03:39.340 --> 03:40.840\n of seeing so many different places\n\n03:40.840 --> 03:42.680\n when we're used to being at home all the time,\n\n03:42.680 --> 03:45.320\n and Andrea, is yours your luggage?\n\n03:45.320 --> 03:48.020\n Yeah, I would say it was the most stressful vacation\n\n03:48.020 --> 03:49.540\n we've been in in our life,\n\n03:49.540 --> 03:51.560\n and it was a valuable learning lesson\n\n03:51.560 --> 03:54.760\n because now I know how to be prepared for trips,\n\n03:54.760 --> 03:57.560\n but we lost our bags and I never got them back.\n\n03:57.560 --> 03:58.680\n And like Alex said,\n\n03:58.680 --> 04:00.560\n we didn't know where we'd be sleeping every night\n\n04:00.560 --> 04:02.940\n and we're just driving through a new city\n\n04:02.940 --> 04:06.000\n with a giant van in the most narrowest streets\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:09.400\n and getting in many, many fights with Italian men.\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:10.840\n So it wasn't really a vacation.\n\n04:10.840 --> 04:13.000\n I saw this motion so many times.\n\n04:14.160 --> 04:16.540\n Wasn't it liberating to lose your baggage?\n\n04:16.540 --> 04:17.720\n Is it still the lining?\n\n04:17.720 --> 04:19.000\n It was liberating.\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.760\n My entire life, I've always had the issue of overpacking.\n\n04:21.760 --> 04:23.360\n And I told her before the trip,\n\n04:23.360 --> 04:25.160\n Andrea, you're gonna pack light, right?\n\n04:25.160 --> 04:26.000\n Yeah, Alex, yeah.\n\n04:26.000 --> 04:28.280\n And then I see her stuffing her overweight suitcase.\n\n04:28.280 --> 04:29.280\n But you did the same.\n\n04:29.280 --> 04:33.440\n We both had giant, big extra baggage that we didn't need.\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:35.520\n And I'm actually very glad we lost it\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:38.520\n because for Venice, hauling that around on all the boats\n\n04:38.520 --> 04:41.120\n and through the tiny streets and there's no Ubers.\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:43.440\n And now it's the first time where I can travel\n\n04:43.440 --> 04:46.440\n without checking in a bag, which I've never done before.\n\n04:46.440 --> 04:48.000\n So now I've learned what it means to pack light\n\n04:48.000 --> 04:50.880\n because I saw that I could survive off of just my,\n\n04:50.880 --> 04:51.960\n this sounds very dramatic,\n\n04:51.960 --> 04:54.340\n but it was really a big learning lesson for me.\n\n04:54.340 --> 04:55.720\n The driving must've been crazy\n\n04:55.720 --> 04:57.880\n because driving in Italy is rough.\n\n04:57.880 --> 04:59.520\n The driving was crazy.\n\n04:59.520 --> 05:03.800\n I did most of it and it would be really interesting\n\n05:03.800 --> 05:06.160\n driving through places like Florence\n\n05:06.160 --> 05:10.080\n or even through the beach areas that were super windy\n\n05:10.080 --> 05:11.520\n because there are two way streets\n\n05:11.520 --> 05:13.240\n that should really only be one way.\n\n05:13.240 --> 05:15.120\n So you'd be driving this huge van\n\n05:15.120 --> 05:17.400\n and then another car comes on a cliff\n\n05:17.400 --> 05:19.480\n and you're just waiting for it to slowly pass.\n\n05:19.480 --> 05:22.980\n So it took all of my focus and concentration\n\n05:22.980 --> 05:24.400\n to drive well in Italy,\n\n05:24.400 --> 05:26.000\n but it was actually really relaxing\n\n05:26.000 --> 05:30.400\n because the hardest thing about making a lot of videos online\n\n05:30.400 --> 05:33.400\n is you're always thinking about it, what's coming next.\n\n05:33.400 --> 05:34.840\n And when we were in Italy,\n\n05:34.840 --> 05:37.480\n it was so chaotic that I did not think about work\n\n05:37.480 --> 05:39.260\n for a good week and a bit.\n\n05:39.260 --> 05:40.440\n Oh, cause you're just.\n\n05:40.440 --> 05:41.280\n We were stressed.\n\n05:41.280 --> 05:42.760\n I was just trying to keep us alive.\n\n05:42.760 --> 05:44.560\n It seemed higher priority.\n\n05:44.560 --> 05:45.640\n And that was kind of fun.\n\n05:45.640 --> 05:46.840\n It was kind of fun.\n\n05:46.840 --> 05:48.240\n No planning, nothing.\n\n05:48.240 --> 05:49.080\n Just on a whim.\n\n05:49.080 --> 05:51.400\n I wouldn't recommend it or ever do that again, but.\n\n05:52.960 --> 05:54.440\n It sounds pretty awesome.\n\n05:54.440 --> 05:57.100\n And we even randomly ran into two friends of ours\n\n05:57.100 --> 05:58.240\n who were in the same city\n\n05:58.240 --> 06:01.080\n and we just traveled with them for about half of the trip.\n\n06:01.080 --> 06:03.280\n Yeah, so you just took on the chaos.\n\n06:03.280 --> 06:04.960\n Exactly, it was an adventure.\n\n06:04.960 --> 06:05.800\n Okay, and I see like,\n\n06:05.800 --> 06:07.040\n cause you were using your hands a lot.\n\n06:07.040 --> 06:10.840\n You picked up some of the Italian hand gestures.\n\n06:10.840 --> 06:11.720\n I did.\n\n06:11.720 --> 06:14.120\n We did get yelled at by a lot of Italians.\n\n06:14.120 --> 06:17.400\n The old Italian grandmas would come to us after breakfast\n\n06:17.400 --> 06:18.920\n cause we'd leave something on the plate\n\n06:18.920 --> 06:19.760\n and she'd be like,\n\n06:19.760 --> 06:21.760\n you could feed an entire village with that.\n\n06:21.760 --> 06:22.680\n Tell your friends.\n\n06:22.680 --> 06:24.320\n And we'd feel so ashamed.\n\n06:24.320 --> 06:25.840\n Yeah, we got cursed out a lot,\n\n06:25.840 --> 06:29.000\n but it really reminded me of where we grew up and helped.\n\n06:29.000 --> 06:29.840\n That's true.\n\n06:29.840 --> 06:30.680\n Yeah, bring back those mechanisms.\n\n06:30.680 --> 06:32.360\n Where'd you grow up?\n\n06:32.360 --> 06:33.640\n We're Romanian,\n\n06:33.640 --> 06:35.360\n but it was like an immigrant neighborhood.\n\n06:35.360 --> 06:36.360\n In Canada.\n\n06:36.360 --> 06:39.280\n So, same if you don't finish your plate,\n\n06:39.280 --> 06:42.000\n that's disrespectful to the people who made the food.\n\n06:42.000 --> 06:43.600\n How was the food in Italy?\n\n06:43.600 --> 06:46.000\n I feel like the carbs thing is too intense.\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.280\n Yeah, I think very overrated in my opinion.\n\n06:48.280 --> 06:51.040\n So I'm actually not supposed to eat gluten\n\n06:51.040 --> 06:52.640\n cause I have an allergy,\n\n06:52.640 --> 06:56.240\n but I was in Italy and it's gluten galore.\n\n06:56.240 --> 06:57.800\n So I was actually eating a lot of it\n\n06:57.800 --> 06:58.800\n and it was very interesting\n\n06:58.800 --> 07:00.800\n cause I didn't get sick while I was in Italy,\n\n07:00.800 --> 07:03.040\n but I do while I'm in the US.\n\n07:03.040 --> 07:08.040\n So somehow the food was actually maybe more okay\n\n07:08.040 --> 07:09.720\n for me to digest, which I appreciated,\n\n07:09.720 --> 07:11.640\n but I didn't like it as much as I thought.\n\n07:11.640 --> 07:12.760\n Did you like the food there?\n\n07:12.760 --> 07:16.960\n Yeah, no, I did, I did.\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:21.560\n I love carbs, but it feels like Vegas\n\n07:21.560 --> 07:24.760\n when I go there for the food is like,\n\n07:24.760 --> 07:28.360\n if I stay here too long, I'm gonna do things I regret.\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:30.120\n That's what it feels like with the food.\n\n07:30.120 --> 07:31.120\n I don't know how to moderate\n\n07:31.120 --> 07:33.840\n and everybody is pushing very large portions\n\n07:33.840 --> 07:36.960\n and while kind of eating things on you,\n\n07:36.960 --> 07:41.640\n pasta, pizza and bread, so delicious.\n\n07:41.640 --> 07:45.440\n So yeah, I love it, but I regret everything.\n\n07:45.440 --> 07:47.800\n So it's like, I don't wanna go to a place\n\n07:47.800 --> 07:51.440\n where I'm going to regret everything I do\n\n07:51.440 --> 07:54.400\n for too long of a time.\n\n07:54.400 --> 07:56.200\n Yeah, surprisingly the people there though\n\n07:56.200 --> 07:59.040\n are still very fit and everyone stays in good shape,\n\n07:59.040 --> 08:00.880\n but that's probably because you're walking around all day\n\n08:00.880 --> 08:02.320\n and you're much more active than anyone.\n\n08:02.320 --> 08:04.480\n And they also just know how to moderate food.\n\n08:04.480 --> 08:07.280\n I think I've gotten used to the US way of eating.\n\n08:07.280 --> 08:09.000\n The US portions. What is that?\n\n08:09.000 --> 08:14.000\n Just a lot, always a lot and more.\n\n08:14.080 --> 08:17.560\n And I feel in the US food advertisements\n\n08:17.560 --> 08:19.320\n are also much more in your face\n\n08:19.320 --> 08:21.480\n and you're more often reminded of junk food\n\n08:21.480 --> 08:22.880\n than we were in Italy.\n\n08:22.880 --> 08:25.480\n So even though we were eating less healthy things,\n\n08:25.480 --> 08:27.280\n I think we were getting cravings\n\n08:27.280 --> 08:29.640\n and being pushed towards junk food less often.\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:33.160\n All right, I gotta ask you a hard question.\n\n08:33.160 --> 08:34.880\n So the romance languages.\n\n08:34.880 --> 08:38.600\n So I think French is up there as like number one.\n\n08:38.600 --> 08:40.360\n Number one in terms of?\n\n08:40.360 --> 08:41.200\n I don't know.\n\n08:41.200 --> 08:42.600\n Who's ranking them?\n\n08:42.600 --> 08:45.320\n Oh, you guys speak Italian or no?\n\n08:45.320 --> 08:49.240\n Not Italian, but we studied French and Spanish in school.\n\n08:49.240 --> 08:50.120\n And Romanian.\n\n08:50.120 --> 08:52.320\n I feel like every country calls their language\n\n08:52.320 --> 08:53.160\n a romance language.\n\n08:53.160 --> 08:58.160\n But it's Romanian, French, Spanish, Portuguese.\n\n08:58.480 --> 09:00.960\n And I think there was one more that was like this dialect,\n\n09:00.960 --> 09:03.400\n but those are considered the romance languages.\n\n09:03.400 --> 09:05.480\n Okay, so where would you put Italian?\n\n09:05.480 --> 09:08.280\n I think we got yelled at so much in Italian\n\n09:08.280 --> 09:10.720\n that it's not gonna be a love word.\n\n09:10.720 --> 09:11.600\n So it wasn't working.\n\n09:11.600 --> 09:12.960\n It's on the bottom of the list\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:15.000\n cause people did not use it nicely to us.\n\n09:15.000 --> 09:18.240\n But I always really liked how French sounds.\n\n09:19.800 --> 09:23.000\n I think something about it where maybe Spanish\n\n09:23.000 --> 09:24.920\n actually sounds nicer to the ears,\n\n09:24.920 --> 09:27.960\n but French has more character and it feels more sultry.\n\n09:27.960 --> 09:29.000\n So I like French.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:29.840\n What about you?\n\n09:29.840 --> 09:30.680\n Yeah, that was my answer too.\n\n09:30.680 --> 09:31.500\n Oh.\n\n09:31.500 --> 09:32.400\n Sultry, okay.\n\n09:32.400 --> 09:33.960\n Yeah.\n\n09:33.960 --> 09:36.960\n I feel like French, in France,\n\n09:36.960 --> 09:39.240\n I feel like I'm always being judged.\n\n09:39.240 --> 09:40.640\n Like they're better than me.\n\n09:40.640 --> 09:41.480\n That's what French.\n\n09:41.480 --> 09:42.320\n They are better than us.\n\n09:42.320 --> 09:43.760\n That's true.\n\n09:43.760 --> 09:44.720\n It's just so true.\n\n09:45.680 --> 09:50.320\n Which is why I long to belong to that.\n\n09:50.320 --> 09:51.840\n I like the British accent.\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:52.680\n The British accent?\n\n09:52.680 --> 09:53.520\n Yeah.\n\n09:53.520 --> 09:55.880\n Actually, one thing we did on our Italian trip\n\n09:55.880 --> 09:58.320\n is we just picked up British accents\n\n09:58.320 --> 10:00.520\n for the entire trip for fun.\n\n10:00.520 --> 10:02.000\n And we forgot we were doing them\n\n10:02.000 --> 10:03.840\n to the point where we talked to British people\n\n10:03.840 --> 10:05.880\n and they'd ask us, why are you talking like that?\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:07.360\n We just couldn't stop.\n\n10:07.360 --> 10:10.440\n I did feel much more elegant and mature.\n\n10:10.440 --> 10:11.280\n That's true.\n\n10:11.280 --> 10:13.560\n People like, I don't know if they felt the same way\n\n10:13.560 --> 10:16.600\n about us, but it was more of the confidence.\n\n10:16.600 --> 10:19.400\n You do feel like you're more poised for sure.\n\n10:19.400 --> 10:20.280\n Yeah.\n\n10:20.280 --> 10:22.320\n So how'd you guys get into chess?\n\n10:22.320 --> 10:24.520\n When did you first, let's say,\n\n10:24.520 --> 10:26.560\n when did you first fall in love with chess?\n\n10:28.280 --> 10:31.000\n So we both started playing when we were pretty young,\n\n10:31.000 --> 10:32.120\n around six years old.\n\n10:32.120 --> 10:33.840\n That's when our dad taught us.\n\n10:33.840 --> 10:36.200\n And I enjoyed playing chess\n\n10:36.200 --> 10:38.720\n because I had good results early on,\n\n10:38.720 --> 10:42.000\n but a lot of it was being pushed from my dad to play chess.\n\n10:42.000 --> 10:44.320\n And I only really started loving it\n\n10:44.320 --> 10:47.320\n when we moved from Canada and we started moving a lot\n\n10:47.320 --> 10:50.400\n and chess was the one stable thing that I had.\n\n10:50.400 --> 10:53.760\n And it was also where all of my friends were.\n\n10:53.760 --> 10:57.480\n So it was kind of that foundational thing for me.\n\n10:57.480 --> 10:59.640\n And that's when I started studying chess very intensely.\n\n10:59.640 --> 11:02.200\n And when I started putting in the hours out of my own will\n\n11:02.200 --> 11:04.000\n and not because I was being pushed by my dad,\n\n11:04.000 --> 11:05.680\n that's when I started really loving it.\n\n11:05.680 --> 11:07.560\n And I even wanted to take time off college\n\n11:07.560 --> 11:09.360\n to just focus on chess.\n\n11:09.360 --> 11:11.440\n So training and competing?\n\n11:11.440 --> 11:12.920\n Training and competing, yeah.\n\n11:12.920 --> 11:15.080\n It was when I was doing it for myself\n\n11:15.080 --> 11:17.440\n that I started getting my best results.\n\n11:17.440 --> 11:19.520\n And actually enjoying the thing.\n\n11:19.520 --> 11:21.200\n And really enjoying it, yeah.\n\n11:21.200 --> 11:23.920\n I would spend summer vacations studying for tournaments\n\n11:23.920 --> 11:25.440\n and my mom would come and say,\n\n11:25.440 --> 11:27.760\n \"'You need to make friends, go leave the house.\"\n\n11:27.760 --> 11:29.880\n And I'd be like, no, I need to play chess.\n\n11:29.880 --> 11:31.800\n And I remember those moments.\n\n11:31.800 --> 11:34.360\n That you rebelled by playing chess, that's awesome.\n\n11:34.360 --> 11:35.320\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n11:35.320 --> 11:36.560\n How did you get into it?\n\n11:36.560 --> 11:39.680\n Yeah, my experience with loving in high school\n\n11:39.680 --> 11:42.120\n is very opposite from Alex's, but right,\n\n11:42.120 --> 11:44.000\n my sister was playing and my dad taught me\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:45.120\n when I was also six. Andrea was cool\n\n11:45.120 --> 11:46.360\n in high school, unlike me.\n\n11:46.360 --> 11:47.200\n You were.\n\n11:47.200 --> 11:49.840\n I wouldn't say cool, I'd say more balanced\n\n11:49.840 --> 11:51.800\n and I was interested in other hobbies.\n\n11:51.800 --> 11:54.760\n In my childhood, if I ever really did love chess,\n\n11:54.760 --> 11:56.880\n there's certainly moments about traveling\n\n11:56.880 --> 11:58.320\n and being together with my family\n\n11:58.320 --> 11:59.680\n and spending those moments together,\n\n11:59.680 --> 12:02.720\n but those are more the social and the experiences.\n\n12:02.720 --> 12:05.440\n But funny enough, I think my happiest moment\n\n12:05.440 --> 12:08.040\n where I really played the game for my own enjoyment\n\n12:08.040 --> 12:11.480\n was probably my most recent tournament.\n\n12:11.480 --> 12:15.040\n Because this was after, obviously, we've been streaming\n\n12:15.040 --> 12:16.040\n and I'm no longer in high school,\n\n12:16.040 --> 12:20.040\n but when I was in school, I was always playing for college\n\n12:20.040 --> 12:22.200\n and for the results, trying to build a resume.\n\n12:22.200 --> 12:24.040\n So I was too stressed out about the pressure\n\n12:24.040 --> 12:25.360\n to really enjoy the game.\n\n12:25.360 --> 12:27.360\n Whereas when I just played my first tournament,\n\n12:27.360 --> 12:31.720\n so it was after a two year break because of the pandemic\n\n12:31.720 --> 12:33.440\n and it was also all live on Twitch,\n\n12:33.440 --> 12:36.960\n so there was some pressure, but it was the first time\n\n12:36.960 --> 12:39.880\n that I was really eager to study for the game,\n\n12:39.880 --> 12:42.120\n sitting and focusing since we've been streaming\n\n12:42.120 --> 12:44.360\n and not getting distracted by something else.\n\n12:44.360 --> 12:46.160\n In years, like I said.\n\n12:46.160 --> 12:48.520\n And the tournament experience, I hit my highest rating\n\n12:48.520 --> 12:50.280\n and it was my best tournament ever.\n\n12:50.280 --> 12:51.880\n And I think most of that is because it came\n\n12:51.880 --> 12:53.040\n from my own enjoyment.\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:56.520\n So you didn't enjoy the domination?\n\n12:56.520 --> 12:58.680\n Because I think you did really well, right?\n\n12:58.680 --> 13:00.400\n This is like a couple months ago?\n\n13:00.400 --> 13:01.400\n Oh yeah, yeah, the tournament.\n\n13:01.400 --> 13:03.440\n Well, of course, I think the results came\n\n13:03.440 --> 13:04.920\n from enjoying the tournament.\n\n13:04.920 --> 13:08.320\n Because I would be in high school studying triple\n\n13:08.320 --> 13:09.800\n the amount of time, like six hours every day\n\n13:09.800 --> 13:12.040\n compared to this tournament, I didn't even prepare for it.\n\n13:12.040 --> 13:13.720\n And for three years, I wouldn't be able\n\n13:13.720 --> 13:16.200\n to pass one rating, whereas in this one tournament,\n\n13:16.200 --> 13:19.720\n I passed it by like 70 points without even any preparation.\n\n13:19.720 --> 13:22.440\n So it was, I think, as soon as you stopped worrying\n\n13:22.440 --> 13:24.920\n about the competitions, when the games get much better.\n\n13:24.920 --> 13:26.520\n What does it mean to pass a rating?\n\n13:26.520 --> 13:28.320\n So I was stuck at 1900.\n\n13:28.320 --> 13:31.120\n 1900 is 100 points off of expert.\n\n13:31.120 --> 13:32.000\n Yeah.\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.800\n Usually when you reach 2000, you're considered an expert,\n\n13:34.800 --> 13:36.760\n which is the rating Andrea was going for.\n\n13:36.760 --> 13:39.240\n Okay, expert, that's a technical term\n\n13:39.240 --> 13:40.880\n or that's like a talk and trash term?\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:42.520\n It's more of a colloquial term\n\n13:42.520 --> 13:44.280\n where if somebody is around a 2000\n\n13:44.280 --> 13:45.560\n and you're playing them in a tournament,\n\n13:45.560 --> 13:47.640\n they won't have the actual title next to their name,\n\n13:47.640 --> 13:49.440\n but you always say, I'm playing an expert.\n\n13:49.440 --> 13:52.440\n What about like the more official things like master?\n\n13:52.440 --> 13:53.880\n Does that have to do with the rating or something else?\n\n13:53.880 --> 13:57.880\n Yeah, so national master in the US is when you're 2200.\n\n13:57.880 --> 13:59.800\n Okay, and what's international master?\n\n13:59.800 --> 14:02.640\n International master is based off of a different system,\n\n14:02.640 --> 14:04.960\n the FIDE system, which is international.\n\n14:04.960 --> 14:09.400\n To be an international master, it's 2400\n\n14:09.400 --> 14:12.480\n and you have to have three international master norms.\n\n14:12.480 --> 14:16.520\n Yeah, I think Magnus said he's a 28, six something.\n\n14:16.520 --> 14:17.360\n That was, yeah.\n\n14:17.360 --> 14:19.600\n And then he said, that's pretty decent.\n\n14:19.600 --> 14:20.440\n Now.\n\n14:20.440 --> 14:21.280\n Well, he always talks a lot about that.\n\n14:21.280 --> 14:23.440\n But see the thing is, I think what he meant\n\n14:23.440 --> 14:25.720\n is that's a decent rating\n\n14:25.720 --> 14:29.040\n because it accurately captures his actual level.\n\n14:29.040 --> 14:32.960\n So it's not overinflated or underinflated and so on.\n\n14:32.960 --> 14:35.800\n And so the discussion there was how do you get to,\n\n14:35.800 --> 14:38.360\n can a human being get to 2900?\n\n14:38.360 --> 14:40.360\n And then he says, because my current rating\n\n14:40.360 --> 14:43.560\n is pretty decent at representing my skill level,\n\n14:43.560 --> 14:46.280\n it's gonna be a long road to actually get there.\n\n14:46.280 --> 14:48.440\n Because it's like, so you have to beat people\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:50.560\n at your same level, that's how the number increases.\n\n14:50.560 --> 14:52.280\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n14:52.280 --> 14:54.480\n And you beat a bunch of people in the tournament, right?\n\n14:54.480 --> 14:55.320\n That are higher than your luck.\n\n14:55.320 --> 14:56.600\n I did, I got very lucky.\n\n14:56.600 --> 14:58.080\n I was playing, I was really nervous\n\n14:58.080 --> 15:01.680\n because my category was like 200 points above my rating.\n\n15:01.680 --> 15:04.080\n And of course, I was very rusty\n\n15:04.080 --> 15:05.520\n and I didn't play in a tournament in a while,\n\n15:05.520 --> 15:07.720\n but it went pretty well.\n\n15:07.720 --> 15:10.360\n Do you feel the pressure when you're actually recording it,\n\n15:10.360 --> 15:11.600\n like the streaming?\n\n15:11.600 --> 15:15.640\n It was definitely, so before every round I was vlogging\n\n15:15.640 --> 15:17.240\n and I was doing meet and greets\n\n15:17.240 --> 15:18.920\n and doing other things for the livestream.\n\n15:18.920 --> 15:21.040\n Yeah, I saw you do a meet and greet.\n\n15:21.040 --> 15:23.320\n You didn't know what the hell you were doing, it's great.\n\n15:23.320 --> 15:24.160\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n15:24.160 --> 15:25.240\n Like what am I, how do I do this?\n\n15:25.240 --> 15:26.480\n Yeah, I see.\n\n15:26.480 --> 15:27.520\n What do I do?\n\n15:27.520 --> 15:29.120\n It was actually really wholesome.\n\n15:29.120 --> 15:31.880\n The beginning was very silly\n\n15:31.880 --> 15:33.600\n because I was just not expecting\n\n15:33.600 --> 15:35.240\n that it was gonna be more of a seminar.\n\n15:35.240 --> 15:37.560\n I thought it was like, oh, you pose and take pictures,\n\n15:37.560 --> 15:39.480\n but they actually asked really nice, meaningful questions,\n\n15:39.480 --> 15:41.520\n but unfortunately it's bad for YouTube retention\n\n15:41.520 --> 15:43.520\n and we cut them all out, so.\n\n15:43.520 --> 15:44.360\n Bad for YouTube?\n\n15:44.360 --> 15:45.200\n Yeah.\n\n15:45.200 --> 15:46.720\n The good long form conversation.\n\n15:46.720 --> 15:47.560\n Yes.\n\n15:47.560 --> 15:48.400\n So it was like questions, Q and A type of thing.\n\n15:48.400 --> 15:51.440\n Exactly, you have to have very fast paced for YouTube\n\n15:51.440 --> 15:54.120\n and that seminar was not fast paced.\n\n15:54.120 --> 15:55.800\n Okay, well, not everything in life\n\n15:55.800 --> 15:57.120\n needs to be on YouTube, right?\n\n15:57.120 --> 15:57.960\n That's true.\n\n15:57.960 --> 15:58.960\n There's like two parallel things,\n\n15:58.960 --> 16:00.400\n stuff that's fun for YouTube.\n\n16:00.400 --> 16:03.360\n Yes, one day we'll post that Q and A.\n\n16:03.360 --> 16:06.440\n Yeah, when you guys like, when you become like ultra famous,\n\n16:06.440 --> 16:08.200\n you're currently just regular famous.\n\n16:08.200 --> 16:12.640\n And then they'll appreciate the long, slow content, yes.\n\n16:12.640 --> 16:15.440\n And that, the YouTube aspect, the creation aspect,\n\n16:15.440 --> 16:17.920\n does that add to the fun, ultimately,\n\n16:17.920 --> 16:20.160\n of the chess, of like your love of chess?\n\n16:20.160 --> 16:21.640\n Oh, for the love of chess in general\n\n16:21.640 --> 16:24.320\n or just for competing in that one tournament?\n\n16:24.320 --> 16:25.400\n No, love of chess in general.\n\n16:25.400 --> 16:28.080\n I think you said that for competing for that tournament\n\n16:28.080 --> 16:29.000\n is adding pressure.\n\n16:29.000 --> 16:31.640\n Yeah, but actually I would say like a good pressure,\n\n16:31.640 --> 16:34.000\n but yeah, this is where I differed to Alex\n\n16:34.000 --> 16:37.880\n because when I was just competitive and I was younger,\n\n16:37.880 --> 16:39.360\n I don't think I loved chess as much\n\n16:39.360 --> 16:41.080\n as when I started doing it for content\n\n16:41.080 --> 16:43.560\n because unlike her, who a lot of her friends\n\n16:43.560 --> 16:46.320\n and social circle were other chess players,\n\n16:46.320 --> 16:47.400\n I never really traveled\n\n16:47.400 --> 16:50.080\n and built really solid friendships through chess\n\n16:50.080 --> 16:52.880\n until I started streaming and meeting other chess streamers\n\n16:52.880 --> 16:55.960\n and actually playing and talking to people for fun\n\n16:55.960 --> 16:58.240\n rather than just always being alone in the game\n\n16:58.240 --> 17:00.560\n and never really meeting other people my age\n\n17:00.560 --> 17:02.160\n or people with similar interests.\n\n17:02.160 --> 17:04.240\n So I would say Twitch was the thing\n\n17:04.240 --> 17:07.360\n that really changed how I approached the game.\n\n17:07.360 --> 17:09.240\n I think with some YouTubers,\n\n17:09.240 --> 17:11.440\n there's a pressure to be almost somebody else.\n\n17:11.440 --> 17:14.320\n You create a persona and you're stuck in that persona.\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:19.120\n I think I'm too much of a boomer\n\n17:19.120 --> 17:20.640\n to know what the hell Twitch is anyway,\n\n17:20.640 --> 17:23.840\n but it feels like when you're actually live streaming,\n\n17:23.840 --> 17:26.160\n you can't help but be who you really are.\n\n17:26.160 --> 17:28.880\n I think it's, oh, well, I think when you're live streaming\n\n17:28.880 --> 17:31.320\n and I've talked to a lot of other streamers about this,\n\n17:31.320 --> 17:33.320\n you kind of just over exaggerate\n\n17:33.320 --> 17:34.880\n one side of your personality.\n\n17:34.880 --> 17:37.680\n And of course, it's kind of like being like on all the time.\n\n17:37.680 --> 17:39.320\n Like you're trying to be more entertaining\n\n17:39.320 --> 17:44.000\n and sometimes you're being silly at moments or more,\n\n17:44.000 --> 17:46.880\n you take what character traits like people know you for.\n\n17:46.880 --> 17:48.760\n And for me, one is being like ADHD\n\n17:48.760 --> 17:52.240\n and the younger sibling who's very energetic\n\n17:52.240 --> 17:53.280\n and causes trouble,\n\n17:53.280 --> 17:54.120\n even though sometimes it's a little switch.\n\n17:54.120 --> 17:56.320\n Yeah, I'm sure you cause trouble just for the camera.\n\n17:56.320 --> 17:57.160\n Yeah, right.\n\n17:57.160 --> 17:59.040\n I think, yeah, I think,\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:00.360\n and of course, once you're live streaming\n\n18:00.360 --> 18:01.640\n for like four or five hours,\n\n18:01.640 --> 18:04.040\n there's gonna be moments in the stream where it's more chill,\n\n18:04.040 --> 18:07.160\n but especially when you're like editing that content\n\n18:07.160 --> 18:10.840\n or you're doing bigger streams that are shorter,\n\n18:10.840 --> 18:13.160\n you are kind of playing up a side of yourself\n\n18:13.160 --> 18:15.160\n because of course, there's a lot of parts of me\n\n18:15.160 --> 18:16.400\n that I don't show to the camera\n\n18:16.400 --> 18:18.160\n because they're not as entertaining to watch,\n\n18:18.160 --> 18:19.760\n like the more serious part.\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:23.440\n And also there's things that you are really interested in\n\n18:23.440 --> 18:24.520\n about what you do.\n\n18:24.520 --> 18:26.480\n Like I love competitive chess\n\n18:26.480 --> 18:28.080\n where I could sit and really think about it,\n\n18:28.080 --> 18:30.200\n but I know that that is not gonna be as entertaining\n\n18:30.200 --> 18:31.040\n for stream.\n\n18:31.040 --> 18:33.200\n I know that's not gonna be as entertaining for YouTube.\n\n18:33.200 --> 18:35.520\n So you kind of have to take what you like,\n\n18:35.520 --> 18:38.480\n but then really adapt it for whatever the format is.\n\n18:38.480 --> 18:41.800\n And sometimes that feels inauthentic,\n\n18:41.800 --> 18:44.520\n but other times it just feels like repackaging\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:47.320\n what you love for people\n\n18:47.320 --> 18:49.080\n in a more general audience to enjoy.\n\n18:49.080 --> 18:51.920\n Do you feel like it's a trap a little bit as you evolve?\n\n18:51.920 --> 18:53.200\n Like you're trapped in?\n\n18:53.200 --> 18:56.360\n Oh, I think social media, oh, sorry, go ahead.\n\n18:56.360 --> 18:59.640\n Social media in general is a trap of that kind?\n\n18:59.640 --> 19:01.360\n Well, so we've been trying to switch\n\n19:01.360 --> 19:03.760\n to learn how to make YouTube videos recently.\n\n19:03.760 --> 19:07.360\n And so much of learning YouTube school\n\n19:07.360 --> 19:09.560\n is kind of the beastification of content\n\n19:09.560 --> 19:12.520\n where you try to get to the point of the video\n\n19:12.520 --> 19:15.400\n within like the first 10 seconds to not lose people.\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:17.160\n The beastificate, you mean like Mr. Beast?\n\n19:17.160 --> 19:18.000\n Yeah. Okay.\n\n19:18.000 --> 19:19.280\n Yeah, where it's so fast paced,\n\n19:19.280 --> 19:21.680\n there's a reason to wait, there's high stakes.\n\n19:21.680 --> 19:24.400\n And everything is created to keep people watching the video\n\n19:24.400 --> 19:25.880\n and keep people on the platform.\n\n19:25.880 --> 19:28.280\n And in some ways it is a trap\n\n19:28.280 --> 19:32.360\n because it's harder to do the kind of content you like\n\n19:32.360 --> 19:34.120\n because you really have to squeeze it to be like,\n\n19:34.120 --> 19:36.440\n okay, well, do we have a good thumbnail for this?\n\n19:36.440 --> 19:38.600\n Do we have a good title for this?\n\n19:38.600 --> 19:41.040\n And that's something that we're trying to figure out\n\n19:41.040 --> 19:45.800\n how to keep true to what we wanna do.\n\n19:45.800 --> 19:47.440\n Yeah, see, the way I think about it is,\n\n19:47.440 --> 19:49.360\n yeah, there's a lot of stuff you can create\n\n19:49.360 --> 19:52.600\n and yeah, the Mr. Beastification process.\n\n19:53.480 --> 19:57.160\n But also I think about what are the videos,\n\n19:57.160 --> 20:01.120\n conversations or things I will create in this life\n\n20:01.120 --> 20:04.000\n that will be the best thing I do.\n\n20:04.960 --> 20:08.680\n And I try not to do things in my life\n\n20:08.680 --> 20:10.800\n that will prevent me from getting there.\n\n20:10.800 --> 20:14.880\n I feel like if you're always focusing on doing kind of,\n\n20:14.880 --> 20:17.600\n optimizing the thumbnail in the 10 seconds and so on,\n\n20:17.600 --> 20:21.400\n you'll never do the thing that's truly you're known for\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:22.680\n and remembered for.\n\n20:22.680 --> 20:25.080\n So finding that balance is tricky.\n\n20:25.080 --> 20:27.240\n I get that, but at the same time,\n\n20:27.240 --> 20:28.640\n this might be my own copium,\n\n20:28.640 --> 20:31.200\n which I know is a word you know now.\n\n20:31.200 --> 20:33.600\n Yeah, I'm slowly learning the full complexity\n\n20:33.600 --> 20:35.080\n of the term, yes.\n\n20:35.080 --> 20:38.680\n But the other way I think about it is,\n\n20:38.680 --> 20:42.640\n it is a skill to learn how to communicate\n\n20:42.640 --> 20:44.640\n with large audiences.\n\n20:44.640 --> 20:47.240\n And first I started streaming chess,\n\n20:47.240 --> 20:49.480\n which is something I just did and really loved,\n\n20:49.480 --> 20:52.440\n but now I have to learn how to translate that format.\n\n20:52.440 --> 20:54.240\n And if that's a skillset we could build,\n\n20:54.240 --> 20:57.080\n then we could use it to do really important things.\n\n20:57.080 --> 20:58.720\n And I've seen a lot of YouTubers\n\n20:58.720 --> 21:01.120\n who have done interviews about how,\n\n21:01.120 --> 21:03.640\n they didn't love the kind of content they did at first,\n\n21:03.640 --> 21:06.040\n but what they're doing right now is really meaningful.\n\n21:06.040 --> 21:08.720\n So I like to think of it, maybe like skill development,\n\n21:08.720 --> 21:11.280\n cause not everybody hits off podcasts\n\n21:11.280 --> 21:12.960\n where they can talk to super interesting people\n\n21:12.960 --> 21:14.120\n right off the bat.\n\n21:14.120 --> 21:17.240\n Yeah, you can be slow and boring in a podcast.\n\n21:17.240 --> 21:19.280\n You don't have to worry about the first 10 seconds.\n\n21:19.280 --> 21:21.200\n I mean, people like keep pushing me for,\n\n21:21.200 --> 21:25.480\n cause the first 10 seconds of the videos I do is,\n\n21:25.480 --> 21:27.080\n well, I know it's most important for YouTube,\n\n21:27.080 --> 21:28.760\n but I don't give a damn.\n\n21:28.760 --> 21:30.640\n I wrote a Chrome extension that hides\n\n21:30.640 --> 21:32.120\n all the views and likes.\n\n21:32.120 --> 21:34.840\n I don't look at the click through.\n\n21:34.840 --> 21:37.040\n I don't look at Twitch views, Andrea does.\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:39.160\n So we also can relate.\n\n21:39.160 --> 21:41.400\n I love numbers too, but that's why I don't look at it.\n\n21:41.400 --> 21:43.560\n Cause you become like, oh,\n\n21:43.560 --> 21:45.680\n you'll start to think that a conversation\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:48.800\n or I think you did sucks because it doesn't get views,\n\n21:48.800 --> 21:50.760\n but that's just not the case.\n\n21:50.760 --> 21:54.120\n YouTube algorithm is this monster that figures stuff out.\n\n21:54.120 --> 21:56.440\n And if you let it control your mind,\n\n21:56.440 --> 21:58.640\n I feel like it's going to destroy you creatively.\n\n21:58.640 --> 22:01.040\n So you have to find a nice balance.\n\n22:01.040 --> 22:02.920\n I have to say, I was laughing a little bit\n\n22:02.920 --> 22:04.840\n when I was listening to the Magnus episode\n\n22:04.840 --> 22:05.760\n and the first 10 minutes,\n\n22:05.760 --> 22:08.200\n you guys are talking about soccer, football.\n\n22:08.200 --> 22:10.920\n Two robots seem human in the conversation.\n\n22:10.920 --> 22:11.920\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n22:11.920 --> 22:14.480\n I was like, let's have some fun,\n\n22:14.480 --> 22:17.680\n make conversation about non chess related topics.\n\n22:17.680 --> 22:19.120\n Yeah, talk about sports.\n\n22:19.120 --> 22:20.640\n Yeah, it was kind of hilarious.\n\n22:20.640 --> 22:24.800\n I was surprised that even at his level,\n\n22:24.800 --> 22:28.640\n I wasn't sure, but I was surprised how much he loves chess.\n\n22:28.640 --> 22:29.880\n It sounds cliche to say,\n\n22:29.880 --> 22:32.480\n but like the way he looked at a chess board,\n\n22:32.480 --> 22:33.720\n you know those memes like,\n\n22:33.720 --> 22:37.360\n I wish somebody looked at me the way he still like\n\n22:37.360 --> 22:40.560\n the way he glanced down and he reached for the pieces\n\n22:40.560 --> 22:42.120\n with excitement to show me something.\n\n22:42.120 --> 22:45.960\n There was, there wasn't like, okay, I'll show you.\n\n22:45.960 --> 22:49.240\n It was like, like there was still that fire.\n\n22:49.240 --> 22:50.840\n That's something that always shocks me\n\n22:50.840 --> 22:53.440\n about some of like super grandmasters.\n\n22:53.440 --> 22:57.200\n Like one of my coaches was a person who also,\n\n22:57.200 --> 22:58.520\n his name's GM Hammer of Norway.\n\n22:58.520 --> 23:00.280\n He also coached Magnus.\n\n23:00.280 --> 23:02.880\n He was his second and he was helping me train\n\n23:02.880 --> 23:04.120\n for my tournament.\n\n23:04.120 --> 23:06.480\n And I was kind of putting off doing the homework.\n\n23:06.480 --> 23:07.600\n He's like, if you're putting it off,\n\n23:07.600 --> 23:09.000\n that means you're studying the wrong thing.\n\n23:09.000 --> 23:11.520\n Like you should be enjoying even when you're practicing,\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:14.360\n which when I grew up, I thought to get to the top level,\n\n23:14.360 --> 23:17.080\n like practicing has to be hard and unpleasant.\n\n23:17.080 --> 23:19.080\n And when I was listening to Magnus episode,\n\n23:19.080 --> 23:20.960\n he was like, I didn't read books very much.\n\n23:20.960 --> 23:22.040\n Or there was one thing that you said\n\n23:22.040 --> 23:25.240\n that's like very normal for studying classical chess\n\n23:25.240 --> 23:27.400\n that he didn't do just because it didn't interest him.\n\n23:27.400 --> 23:29.200\n He says, I suck at puzzles.\n\n23:29.200 --> 23:30.160\n I don't like puzzles.\n\n23:30.160 --> 23:32.320\n Yeah, and he doesn't do what he doesn't enjoy.\n\n23:32.320 --> 23:35.640\n And that's because it's like purely driven out of passion.\n\n23:35.640 --> 23:38.400\n I think the internet was like, I suck at puzzles too.\n\n23:38.400 --> 23:39.240\n Yeah, they like that.\n\n23:39.240 --> 23:41.600\n They're grandmasters.\n\n23:41.600 --> 23:43.080\n I don't have to study at all.\n\n23:43.080 --> 23:44.400\n It's just, it's fun.\n\n23:44.400 --> 23:47.920\n And, but I think the lesson there that's really powerful\n\n23:47.920 --> 23:50.000\n is he spends most of the day thinking about chess\n\n23:50.000 --> 23:51.440\n because he wants to.\n\n23:51.440 --> 23:54.200\n So do whatever, if you're into getting better at chess,\n\n23:54.200 --> 23:57.720\n do whatever it takes to actually just the number of hours\n\n23:57.720 --> 24:00.400\n you spend a day thinking about chess, maximize that.\n\n24:00.400 --> 24:02.080\n If you're like super serious about it.\n\n24:02.080 --> 24:03.800\n I actually get very addicted\n\n24:03.800 --> 24:05.720\n whenever I start studying chess,\n\n24:05.720 --> 24:08.120\n which is why I don't do it as seriously\n\n24:08.120 --> 24:10.600\n when I'm focused on content.\n\n24:10.600 --> 24:13.160\n Cause I go through these rabbit holes\n\n24:13.160 --> 24:14.880\n where if I'm focusing on chess,\n\n24:14.880 --> 24:17.560\n I wanna be as good as I possibly can at the game.\n\n24:17.560 --> 24:19.320\n Otherwise it's hard for me to enjoy it\n\n24:19.320 --> 24:21.280\n cause it's such a competitive thing.\n\n24:21.280 --> 24:23.240\n And I remember training for tournaments\n\n24:23.240 --> 24:25.120\n and when you're training for tournaments,\n\n24:25.120 --> 24:27.480\n you even start dreaming about chess\n\n24:27.480 --> 24:29.480\n and you can stop thinking about it.\n\n24:29.480 --> 24:31.200\n And it's as if you're flipped\n\n24:31.200 --> 24:33.360\n into this completely different world,\n\n24:33.360 --> 24:35.240\n which is also what I like best about the game\n\n24:35.240 --> 24:38.400\n that it's a completely different living experience.\n\n24:38.400 --> 24:39.360\n And then you take some drugs\n\n24:39.360 --> 24:41.520\n and now you start to see things on the ceiling.\n\n24:41.520 --> 24:44.400\n Is there some factual hallucination\n\n24:44.400 --> 24:48.680\n like to the Queen's Gambit, like those scenes?\n\n24:48.680 --> 24:49.800\n I think it's...\n\n24:49.800 --> 24:51.640\n Is that based on your life story?\n\n24:51.640 --> 24:53.520\n Well, I can't say that on camera.\n\n24:53.520 --> 24:55.000\n No, just kidding.\n\n24:55.000 --> 24:58.360\n Actually chess players are very careful to not take drugs.\n\n24:58.360 --> 25:00.520\n They drink a lot.\n\n25:00.520 --> 25:01.480\n They drink so much.\n\n25:01.480 --> 25:03.720\n It's actually crazy for how good they're able\n\n25:03.720 --> 25:05.440\n to play chess when they do.\n\n25:05.440 --> 25:07.800\n But when it comes to things like psychedelics\n\n25:07.800 --> 25:10.240\n or other things, they usually stay away from those\n\n25:10.240 --> 25:12.200\n cause they don't wanna mess anything up in their brain.\n\n25:12.200 --> 25:13.920\n So this is actually intervention.\n\n25:13.920 --> 25:17.040\n I saw that you mentioned somewhere,\n\n25:17.040 --> 25:18.320\n I think it was the lie detector test\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:20.040\n where you have a drinking problem.\n\n25:20.040 --> 25:22.280\n Is that an actual...\n\n25:22.280 --> 25:25.320\n I think that's actually a meme\n\n25:25.320 --> 25:27.240\n that we like to joke about on stream\n\n25:27.240 --> 25:29.920\n because occasionally we'd have like a white claw on stream\n\n25:29.920 --> 25:31.000\n or something like that.\n\n25:31.000 --> 25:32.200\n And then people meme about it.\n\n25:32.200 --> 25:33.600\n It goes back to Andrea's point\n\n25:33.600 --> 25:36.600\n of amplifying a part of your personality\n\n25:36.600 --> 25:39.520\n to make yourself a little bit more entertaining.\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:41.920\n I'm gonna use that as an excuse from now on.\n\n25:41.920 --> 25:45.360\n This podcast is just amplifying a part of that personality.\n\n25:45.360 --> 25:48.760\n I'm not really like this, but have you played drunk?\n\n25:48.760 --> 25:50.640\n Like Magnus has played drunk.\n\n25:50.640 --> 25:52.520\n He says it helps someone with the creativity.\n\n25:52.520 --> 25:53.880\n Is there any truth to that?\n\n25:53.880 --> 25:55.360\n Well, Andrea is under 21,\n\n25:55.360 --> 25:59.080\n so she's obviously would never do that.\n\n25:59.080 --> 26:01.200\n But I have played while drinking.\n\n26:01.200 --> 26:05.520\n Actually, I enjoy playing chess and drinking\n\n26:05.520 --> 26:08.840\n more than pre gaming or going out to a club and drinking,\n\n26:08.840 --> 26:10.240\n which sounds really silly.\n\n26:10.240 --> 26:11.800\n And I'll usually play against opponents\n\n26:11.800 --> 26:14.040\n who are also having some beer.\n\n26:14.040 --> 26:17.120\n And it does make you feel like you're seeing the game\n\n26:17.120 --> 26:18.720\n from a fresher perspective\n\n26:18.720 --> 26:22.200\n where it can sometimes make you feel more confident,\n\n26:22.200 --> 26:24.840\n liquid confidence, and it does help with creativity.\n\n26:24.840 --> 26:27.480\n You just feel like you could pull things off,\n\n26:27.480 --> 26:28.440\n but there's also a limit.\n\n26:28.440 --> 26:30.440\n It's more like you've had one drink or two drink,\n\n26:30.440 --> 26:31.840\n but then it goes beyond that.\n\n26:31.840 --> 26:33.560\n And then you just start missing tactics\n\n26:33.560 --> 26:34.560\n and it's not worth it.\n\n26:34.560 --> 26:36.400\n Yeah, I think it only helps players\n\n26:36.400 --> 26:38.040\n in very short time controls.\n\n26:38.040 --> 26:40.640\n One time I was challenging this grandmaster on stream\n\n26:40.640 --> 26:42.280\n and we were playing bullet chess,\n\n26:42.280 --> 26:44.000\n which is one minute chess.\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:45.520\n And I was giving him handicaps.\n\n26:45.520 --> 26:47.360\n And I said, okay, you have to take four shots\n\n26:47.360 --> 26:48.600\n before the next game.\n\n26:48.600 --> 26:50.720\n And he just got like 10 times stronger\n\n26:50.720 --> 26:52.440\n and transformed into like the Hulk\n\n26:52.440 --> 26:55.240\n and destroyed me more than the last game.\n\n26:55.240 --> 26:57.840\n But of course, if you're playing like a three hour game,\n\n26:57.840 --> 26:58.680\n it's gonna get old.\n\n26:58.680 --> 27:00.960\n But I think in short time controls, it's amazing.\n\n27:00.960 --> 27:02.560\n Yeah, definitely has to be blitz.\n\n27:02.560 --> 27:04.520\n It has to be where it's more intuition\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:06.360\n rather than sitting and calculating.\n\n27:06.360 --> 27:08.160\n This is probably like negatively affecting\n\n27:08.160 --> 27:09.160\n your ability to calculate.\n\n27:09.160 --> 27:10.440\n Absolutely, yeah.\n\n27:10.440 --> 27:11.720\n How much when you guys play,\n\n27:11.720 --> 27:12.760\n when you look at the chess board,\n\n27:12.760 --> 27:14.120\n how much of it is calculation?\n\n27:14.120 --> 27:17.520\n How much of it is intuition?\n\n27:17.520 --> 27:21.520\n How much of it is memorized openings?\n\n27:22.480 --> 27:25.680\n It really depends between short form chess.\n\n27:25.680 --> 27:27.720\n So five minutes, three minutes, one minute\n\n27:27.720 --> 27:29.040\n and classical chess.\n\n27:29.040 --> 27:30.040\n What's your favorite to play?\n\n27:30.040 --> 27:33.440\n I love playing blitz now because that's most of what I do.\n\n27:33.440 --> 27:35.440\n And that's actually how I got into chess streaming\n\n27:35.440 --> 27:37.240\n because I couldn't spend entire weekends\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:38.400\n or weeks playing tournaments.\n\n27:38.400 --> 27:40.960\n I would just, while I was in college, log on\n\n27:40.960 --> 27:43.640\n and play these long blitz or bullet sessions.\n\n27:43.640 --> 27:44.960\n And it's very fast.\n\n27:44.960 --> 27:48.400\n So you don't have time to go calculate as deeply.\n\n27:48.400 --> 27:51.640\n You basically have to calculate short lines pretty quickly.\n\n27:51.640 --> 27:55.240\n And a lot of it is pattern recognition and intuition.\n\n27:55.240 --> 27:56.320\n As three minutes, you said?\n\n27:56.320 --> 27:57.520\n Three minutes, yeah.\n\n27:57.520 --> 27:58.360\n Okay, cool.\n\n27:58.360 --> 28:00.920\n And so for that, it's just basically intuition.\n\n28:00.920 --> 28:02.760\n A lot of it is intuition, yeah.\n\n28:02.760 --> 28:04.880\n See, I saw on streams you actually keep talking\n\n28:04.880 --> 28:05.720\n while playing chess.\n\n28:05.720 --> 28:06.560\n It seems really difficult.\n\n28:06.560 --> 28:07.400\n Yeah, that helps my result.\n\n28:07.400 --> 28:08.640\n That doesn't help my result.\n\n28:08.640 --> 28:09.480\n It doesn't, it hurts.\n\n28:09.480 --> 28:10.520\n It helps content, not the game.\n\n28:10.520 --> 28:11.600\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n28:11.600 --> 28:12.920\n But you can still do it.\n\n28:12.920 --> 28:15.520\n Because it feels like how can you possibly concentrate\n\n28:15.520 --> 28:17.040\n while talking?\n\n28:17.040 --> 28:19.160\n It's because so much of it is intuition.\n\n28:19.160 --> 28:20.760\n You're not, while you're talking,\n\n28:20.760 --> 28:22.120\n you're thinking about that topic,\n\n28:22.120 --> 28:23.360\n but then you just come to the board\n\n28:23.360 --> 28:26.200\n and you just understand what you should be doing here.\n\n28:26.200 --> 28:28.080\n And then sometimes you get in trouble\n\n28:28.080 --> 28:29.840\n because you're talking and you have now lost\n\n28:29.840 --> 28:30.680\n half of your time.\n\n28:30.680 --> 28:32.520\n You have a minute and a half, your opponent has three,\n\n28:32.520 --> 28:34.360\n and you're kind of at a disadvantage.\n\n28:34.360 --> 28:36.840\n But that kind of goes to show\n\n28:36.840 --> 28:38.680\n that that's how blitz chess usually works,\n\n28:38.680 --> 28:40.200\n whereas classical is very different.\n\n28:40.200 --> 28:41.840\n Which of you is better at chess?\n\n28:41.840 --> 28:43.200\n I mean, let's do it this way.\n\n28:43.200 --> 28:47.680\n Can you, Andrea, can you say what,\n\n28:47.680 --> 28:49.840\n in which way is Alex stronger than you?\n\n28:49.840 --> 28:51.680\n Which way is she weaker than you?\n\n28:51.680 --> 28:54.800\n Not physically in terms of chess.\n\n28:56.000 --> 28:58.240\n Well, yes, of course she is higher rated.\n\n28:58.240 --> 29:01.800\n But when we do play, I think her strengths against me\n\n29:01.800 --> 29:03.640\n where she really gets me is the end game.\n\n29:03.640 --> 29:06.080\n She has stronger end game, so she can,\n\n29:06.080 --> 29:08.280\n and I actually have a stronger opening,\n\n29:08.280 --> 29:09.120\n but as soon as she's able to simplify.\n\n29:09.120 --> 29:11.400\n Andrea, I'm supposed to say what is good about you,\n\n29:11.400 --> 29:12.240\n not you.\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:13.640\n You know, I'm getting there.\n\n29:13.640 --> 29:14.840\n Well, see, this is what I'm saying,\n\n29:14.840 --> 29:17.400\n because don't worry, it's related, okay?\n\n29:17.400 --> 29:19.200\n Because if I can get an advantage\n\n29:19.200 --> 29:20.200\n in the beginning of the game,\n\n29:20.200 --> 29:22.160\n but as soon as she starts trading pieces down,\n\n29:22.160 --> 29:23.440\n like my confidence drops,\n\n29:23.440 --> 29:25.160\n because I know that the end game\n\n29:25.160 --> 29:27.520\n is the hardest part of the game and the longest,\n\n29:27.520 --> 29:29.240\n and that's where she ends up beating me.\n\n29:29.240 --> 29:32.840\n So her end game is I think really what makes the difference.\n\n29:32.840 --> 29:36.960\n It sounds like her psychological warfare is better too,\n\n29:36.960 --> 29:39.040\n because if you're getting nervous.\n\n29:39.040 --> 29:41.360\n But it's harder to play against higher rated players,\n\n29:41.360 --> 29:44.920\n same how Magnus and former world champions\n\n29:44.920 --> 29:46.560\n have that psychological edge.\n\n29:46.560 --> 29:48.560\n So I think it's always going to be different for Andrea,\n\n29:48.560 --> 29:50.360\n because she knows statistically\n\n29:50.360 --> 29:52.920\n she should be winning something like one in four games,\n\n29:52.920 --> 29:55.120\n but she usually does better than that,\n\n29:55.120 --> 29:58.000\n because she's very distracting and talks a lot.\n\n29:58.000 --> 29:59.080\n That does help.\n\n29:59.080 --> 30:01.920\n What does it feel like to play a higher rated player?\n\n30:01.920 --> 30:03.720\n What's the experience of that?\n\n30:06.760 --> 30:08.800\n Playing somebody like Magnus.\n\n30:08.800 --> 30:11.880\n So it depends on how much higher rated than you they are.\n\n30:11.880 --> 30:13.760\n If it's someone who's like between me and Andrea,\n\n30:13.760 --> 30:16.200\n let's say it's a 200 point difference,\n\n30:16.200 --> 30:17.240\n you know they should win,\n\n30:17.240 --> 30:19.680\n but at least you still feel like you have a chance.\n\n30:19.680 --> 30:21.840\n I was playing in a title Tuesday,\n\n30:21.840 --> 30:24.480\n which is this tournament chess.com has every Tuesday.\n\n30:24.480 --> 30:26.760\n And I got really lucky, beat a GM,\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:27.880\n drew an international master,\n\n30:27.880 --> 30:30.480\n and then I got paired against Hikaru Nakamura.\n\n30:30.480 --> 30:32.440\n And my brain just went blank,\n\n30:32.440 --> 30:35.200\n because I just know that I'm so unlikely to win\n\n30:35.200 --> 30:37.520\n that I couldn't even play the game properly\n\n30:37.520 --> 30:39.000\n when it's that much of a difference\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:41.560\n where they should be winning like 99% of the time.\n\n30:42.480 --> 30:43.800\n But that's like psychological.\n\n30:43.800 --> 30:45.520\n So you're saying that's the biggest experience\n\n30:45.520 --> 30:48.240\n is like actually knowing the numbers\n\n30:48.240 --> 30:50.600\n and statistically thinking there's no way I can win.\n\n30:50.600 --> 30:52.680\n But I meant like, is there a suffocating feeling\n\n30:52.680 --> 30:54.840\n like positionally you feel like\n\n30:54.840 --> 30:57.800\n you're constantly under attack?\n\n30:57.800 --> 31:00.640\n You just feel like you're slowly getting outsmarted.\n\n31:00.640 --> 31:02.640\n And the worst is when you don't even know\n\n31:02.640 --> 31:03.800\n what you're doing wrong.\n\n31:03.800 --> 31:05.560\n You come out of that and you're like,\n\n31:05.560 --> 31:08.480\n I thought I was doing great and I got slowly squeezed.\n\n31:08.480 --> 31:10.400\n I didn't understand what was going on.\n\n31:10.400 --> 31:11.760\n And you're just kind of baffled.\n\n31:11.760 --> 31:15.280\n It's kind of like watching AlphaZero beat up Stockfish.\n\n31:15.280 --> 31:18.320\n And you don't really understand why it's making certain moves\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:19.760\n or how it thought of the plan.\n\n31:19.760 --> 31:22.600\n You just see it slowly getting the position better.\n\n31:22.600 --> 31:24.280\n And that's what it feels like.\n\n31:24.280 --> 31:26.960\n I would add it's kind of different for me\n\n31:26.960 --> 31:29.240\n if they're someone who's significantly higher rated.\n\n31:29.240 --> 31:31.000\n So let's say more than like 300 points\n\n31:31.000 --> 31:32.720\n or you're playing Magnus.\n\n31:32.720 --> 31:35.520\n What I notice is I just feel lost straight\n\n31:35.520 --> 31:37.560\n as soon as I don't know my preparation\n\n31:37.560 --> 31:39.360\n because they know so many opening lines\n\n31:39.360 --> 31:41.280\n that they're gonna know the best line to beat you\n\n31:41.280 --> 31:42.760\n that you haven't studied.\n\n31:42.760 --> 31:44.120\n So then on move 10, you're like,\n\n31:44.120 --> 31:47.360\n he already has a maybe plus 0.5 advantage\n\n31:47.360 --> 31:48.600\n which is really small.\n\n31:48.600 --> 31:51.720\n But for someone with such a significant skill level\n\n31:51.720 --> 31:53.240\n you know you already lost at that point.\n\n31:53.240 --> 31:57.200\n And it's like a third of the game.\n\n31:57.200 --> 32:00.760\n What are the strengths and weaknesses of Andrea?\n\n32:00.760 --> 32:04.480\n Andrea is very good at opening preparation.\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:05.320\n As she said.\n\n32:05.320 --> 32:07.720\n As she said, she likes bringing that up.\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:09.320\n I mean, she's very meticulous about it\n\n32:09.320 --> 32:13.640\n where she'll really go in and learn her lines.\n\n32:13.640 --> 32:16.000\n And having that initial starting confidence\n\n32:16.000 --> 32:17.600\n isn't just helpful for the opening\n\n32:17.600 --> 32:20.280\n but it helps develop your plans for the middle game.\n\n32:20.280 --> 32:23.280\n So I think she's very good at that.\n\n32:23.280 --> 32:25.320\n I think she's actually pretty good\n\n32:25.320 --> 32:27.840\n at tactical combinations.\n\n32:28.720 --> 32:29.760\n What is tactics?\n\n32:29.760 --> 32:33.560\n Tactics is like solving puzzles\n\n32:33.560 --> 32:36.520\n or basically finding lines that are forced\n\n32:36.520 --> 32:39.120\n where if you find them, you're going to win.\n\n32:39.120 --> 32:41.720\n So that's like puzzles within a position.\n\n32:41.720 --> 32:42.640\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n32:42.640 --> 32:45.800\n Whereas strategic chess is making slow moves\n\n32:45.800 --> 32:48.240\n and over the process of like 20 moves\n\n32:48.240 --> 32:50.960\n you get a slightly better position based on\n\n32:50.960 --> 32:54.000\n an understanding of the overall strategy.\n\n32:54.000 --> 32:57.000\n So in my extensive research review on Wikipedia,\n\n32:58.400 --> 33:00.560\n it says your most played opening\n\n33:00.560 --> 33:02.880\n is the King's Indian defense.\n\n33:02.880 --> 33:04.880\n In which, quote, black allows white\n\n33:04.880 --> 33:07.560\n to advance their pawns to the center of the board\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:09.320\n in the first two moves.\n\n33:09.320 --> 33:11.200\n Is there any truth to this?\n\n33:11.200 --> 33:12.680\n So the King's Indian.\n\n33:12.680 --> 33:13.520\n And what is it?\n\n33:13.520 --> 33:15.640\n Probably is my most played opening.\n\n33:15.640 --> 33:19.080\n And it's one where even when my coach\n\n33:19.080 --> 33:20.320\n who was a grandmaster taught me,\n\n33:20.320 --> 33:21.320\n he was like, so you know,\n\n33:21.320 --> 33:23.240\n I've been playing the King's Indian for 10 years\n\n33:23.240 --> 33:25.200\n and I still don't understand it.\n\n33:25.200 --> 33:27.400\n And it's one of those openings that computers\n\n33:27.400 --> 33:29.600\n really don't like because you do,\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:31.320\n or at least Stockfish doesn't like it.\n\n33:31.320 --> 33:32.920\n Maybe AlphaZero would change their mind.\n\n33:32.920 --> 33:34.400\n I forgot to look at what.\n\n33:34.400 --> 33:35.880\n Can you show me, by the way, what it is?\n\n33:35.880 --> 33:36.720\n Yeah.\n\n33:36.720 --> 33:39.880\n Is it white's opening or black's opening?\n\n33:39.880 --> 33:44.880\n Black responds to the D4 Queen's pawn push.\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:46.720\n And you take your knight out to F6.\n\n33:46.720 --> 33:50.280\n I'll just put in the stereotypical,\n\n33:50.280 --> 33:52.960\n classical King's Indian more so to say.\n\n33:54.600 --> 33:57.000\n We actually have a very famous King's Indian game\n\n33:57.000 --> 33:58.640\n in the notes that we prepared.\n\n33:58.640 --> 33:59.480\n Okay.\n\n33:59.480 --> 34:02.960\n For the record, I asked you guys for some games\n\n34:02.960 --> 34:04.280\n that you find pretty cool\n\n34:04.280 --> 34:06.520\n and maybe to get a chance to talk about some.\n\n34:06.520 --> 34:07.640\n Yeah.\n\n34:07.640 --> 34:09.200\n So this is the King's Indian.\n\n34:09.200 --> 34:13.560\n As you can see, white has much more control\n\n34:13.560 --> 34:14.400\n over the center.\n\n34:14.400 --> 34:16.520\n White has three pawns in the center\n\n34:16.520 --> 34:19.400\n while black has none past the fifth rank.\n\n34:19.400 --> 34:21.760\n And you just have this pawn on D6.\n\n34:21.760 --> 34:23.520\n And one of the ideas in chess is\n\n34:23.520 --> 34:24.960\n if you're not taking the center,\n\n34:24.960 --> 34:26.960\n then your plan revolves around\n\n34:26.960 --> 34:29.440\n trying to continually challenge it.\n\n34:29.440 --> 34:33.000\n But what is really fun about the King's Indian\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:37.880\n is that black sometimes gets these crazy King side attacks\n\n34:37.880 --> 34:39.600\n while white gets Queen side attacks.\n\n34:39.600 --> 34:43.080\n And even though it's a little bit suspicious for black\n\n34:43.080 --> 34:45.560\n and the computer could usually break it,\n\n34:45.560 --> 34:49.040\n it's hard to defend as a human when you're being attacked.\n\n34:49.040 --> 34:51.480\n But if you don't pull off the attack as black,\n\n34:51.480 --> 34:54.120\n then you're just gonna end up being lost in the end game.\n\n34:54.120 --> 34:56.320\n So it's like a very asymmetrical position.\n\n34:56.320 --> 34:57.720\n It's very asymmetrical,\n\n34:57.720 --> 35:00.200\n although a lot of people now stop playing\n\n35:00.200 --> 35:01.840\n into the classical King's Indian,\n\n35:01.840 --> 35:04.600\n even though computers give it a big advantage.\n\n35:04.600 --> 35:07.760\n And they play these slower lines in the King's Indian,\n\n35:07.760 --> 35:09.480\n which are less fun to play.\n\n35:09.480 --> 35:10.400\n What's slower mean?\n\n35:10.400 --> 35:14.680\n It takes a longer time to do something interesting with?\n\n35:15.680 --> 35:18.360\n They basically don't let you get as much\n\n35:18.360 --> 35:19.680\n of a King side attack\n\n35:19.680 --> 35:22.000\n because they try opening up the center\n\n35:22.000 --> 35:23.800\n and then you have no weaknesses,\n\n35:23.800 --> 35:27.000\n but you're just slowly improving the position of your pieces\n\n35:27.000 --> 35:29.320\n instead of being able to go for that King side attack.\n\n35:29.320 --> 35:30.600\n So for people just listening,\n\n35:30.600 --> 35:34.840\n there is the white pawns are all on the fourth row\n\n35:34.840 --> 35:35.840\n in a row together.\n\n35:35.840 --> 35:37.520\n That feels like a bad position.\n\n35:37.520 --> 35:38.360\n For black?\n\n35:38.360 --> 35:39.480\n For white.\n\n35:39.480 --> 35:41.320\n Oh, you don't like taking the center?\n\n35:41.320 --> 35:43.400\n No, I like taking the center.\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:44.920\n Now you're talking trash already.\n\n35:44.920 --> 35:45.760\n Oh, sorry.\n\n35:45.760 --> 35:49.440\n But it's just like they're like feel vulnerable\n\n35:49.440 --> 35:50.680\n there in a row together.\n\n35:50.680 --> 35:53.360\n Like it's like, you know,\n\n35:53.360 --> 35:54.880\n cause they're like, who's gonna defend them?\n\n35:54.880 --> 35:57.480\n I guess the Knights defend and the Queen defends it.\n\n35:57.480 --> 35:59.440\n You're actually talking about a theme\n\n35:59.440 --> 36:02.320\n that you do see sometimes, which is called hanging pawns.\n\n36:02.320 --> 36:04.440\n And when you have two pawns right next to each other\n\n36:04.440 --> 36:06.320\n with no other pawns to defend them.\n\n36:06.320 --> 36:09.960\n Yeah, so it is a valid point.\n\n36:09.960 --> 36:10.800\n And actually as black,\n\n36:10.800 --> 36:12.320\n you're trying to break apart these pawns\n\n36:12.320 --> 36:15.920\n or get them to push and create some holes into the position,\n\n36:15.920 --> 36:17.640\n but it's a trade off.\n\n36:17.640 --> 36:20.880\n And that's a lot of what chess openings are about.\n\n36:20.880 --> 36:21.920\n You get more space,\n\n36:21.920 --> 36:24.120\n but you'll also end up having to protect your pawns\n\n36:24.120 --> 36:26.080\n potentially or move them forward to the point\n\n36:26.080 --> 36:27.200\n where they're overextended.\n\n36:27.200 --> 36:30.080\n And plus pawns being vulnerable, it's kind of fun.\n\n36:30.080 --> 36:31.800\n It's like, there's more stuff in danger.\n\n36:31.800 --> 36:34.520\n They're not, cause if it's like this,\n\n36:34.520 --> 36:37.280\n everything's like trapped, like you can't do anything.\n\n36:37.280 --> 36:38.360\n Everything's blocked, yeah.\n\n36:38.360 --> 36:40.000\n And blocked off, yeah.\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.920\n It's like you can't have fun.\n\n36:41.920 --> 36:44.720\n Yeah, one of the most,\n\n36:44.720 --> 36:46.120\n one of the opening principles for white\n\n36:46.120 --> 36:47.520\n is get your pawns in the center.\n\n36:47.520 --> 36:51.880\n So I'd say like this is actually preferable for white.\n\n36:51.880 --> 36:53.440\n Let's go over some opening principles.\n\n36:53.440 --> 36:54.280\n There we go.\n\n36:54.280 --> 36:56.000\n Cause this is a very good learning lesson\n\n36:56.000 --> 36:59.000\n for any chess beginners in the audience.\n\n37:01.880 --> 37:04.200\n Okay, so first thing you wanna do is control the center.\n\n37:04.200 --> 37:07.200\n There we go, E4, the more aggressive one.\n\n37:07.200 --> 37:09.760\n Isn't that like the basic vanilla move?\n\n37:09.760 --> 37:12.320\n I didn't, somebody told me that's the most popular\n\n37:12.320 --> 37:14.320\n opening move in chess.\n\n37:14.320 --> 37:15.160\n It is.\n\n37:15.160 --> 37:16.360\n Why is that considered aggressive?\n\n37:16.360 --> 37:20.400\n So it's E4 and D4 and the king's pawn is known\n\n37:20.400 --> 37:22.640\n as being for more tactical players,\n\n37:22.640 --> 37:25.840\n whereas D4 is known for more positional players.\n\n37:25.840 --> 37:28.400\n So that's why it's considered more aggressive.\n\n37:28.400 --> 37:29.240\n Tactical.\n\n37:29.240 --> 37:30.880\n More gambits with E4, I think.\n\n37:30.880 --> 37:35.600\n So tactical means I'm gonna try to attack you.\n\n37:35.600 --> 37:37.680\n You're gonna try to go for puzzles\n\n37:37.680 --> 37:42.480\n and rely more on your combination abilities.\n\n37:42.480 --> 37:44.560\n Whereas if it's something positional,\n\n37:44.560 --> 37:46.840\n you usually have like three to four moves\n\n37:46.840 --> 37:48.040\n that are all good in the position,\n\n37:48.040 --> 37:50.760\n whereas tactics, you need to see this one line.\n\n37:50.760 --> 37:52.280\n So it's more precise.\n\n37:52.280 --> 37:54.960\n So this one's cool cause he can like,\n\n37:54.960 --> 37:57.080\n the queen can come out, the bishop can come out.\n\n37:57.080 --> 38:00.520\n Yeah, and that's one of the most popular checkmates\n\n38:00.520 --> 38:02.320\n and usually what you teach new students\n\n38:02.320 --> 38:03.760\n to try to cheese their friends\n\n38:03.760 --> 38:04.960\n cause then they feel really excited\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:06.120\n that they know this new trap\n\n38:06.120 --> 38:07.960\n where you bring the bishop and the queen out\n\n38:07.960 --> 38:09.600\n and you try to checkmate on F7.\n\n38:09.600 --> 38:10.440\n Yeah.\n\n38:10.440 --> 38:12.840\n It's the trap that queen's gambit, Beth Harmon,\n\n38:12.840 --> 38:16.240\n falls for in their first game versus the janitor.\n\n38:16.240 --> 38:18.680\n She gets all mad cause she gets checkmated very early.\n\n38:18.680 --> 38:20.000\n Oh, that's the one she gets checkmated with?\n\n38:20.000 --> 38:20.840\n Yeah.\n\n38:20.840 --> 38:21.680\n Okay.\n\n38:21.680 --> 38:23.080\n I love how you guys were actually paying attention\n\n38:23.080 --> 38:25.240\n to the games carefully,\n\n38:25.240 --> 38:26.840\n which is pretty cool that they did a good job\n\n38:26.840 --> 38:29.920\n of improving, evolving her game throughout the show\n\n38:29.920 --> 38:33.360\n to actually represent an actual growth of a chess player.\n\n38:33.360 --> 38:34.200\n Yeah.\n\n38:34.200 --> 38:37.520\n They really took every detail into consideration,\n\n38:37.520 --> 38:38.440\n which was cool.\n\n38:38.440 --> 38:39.280\n Okay.\n\n38:39.280 --> 38:40.120\n So what else?\n\n38:40.120 --> 38:41.960\n That's, I brought stuff into the center.\n\n38:41.960 --> 38:42.800\n We'll do the same.\n\n38:42.800 --> 38:43.640\n Okay.\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:45.560\n So then you want to develop your pieces.\n\n38:45.560 --> 38:46.720\n So in the beginning of the game,\n\n38:46.720 --> 38:49.160\n you want to take out the bishops and knights first\n\n38:49.160 --> 38:50.560\n because you don't want to start\n\n38:50.560 --> 38:53.080\n with the most valuable piece like the queen\n\n38:53.080 --> 38:54.880\n cause then it'll become a vulnerability\n\n38:54.880 --> 38:57.120\n and it'll get attacked very early on.\n\n38:57.120 --> 39:00.400\n And the reason you're taking out these two pieces first\n\n39:00.400 --> 39:02.480\n is cause you want to castle your king.\n\n39:02.480 --> 39:04.680\n So you can move a knight move or a bishop move\n\n39:04.680 --> 39:06.720\n and that's considered developing.\n\n39:06.720 --> 39:07.560\n Yeah.\n\n39:07.560 --> 39:10.320\n So at this stage, not like even before\n\n39:10.320 --> 39:11.960\n getting a few pawns out.\n\n39:11.960 --> 39:14.920\n You usually want to start with getting a pawn\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:16.960\n because you want to get space in the center,\n\n39:16.960 --> 39:18.880\n but also when you push pawns,\n\n39:18.880 --> 39:21.160\n it helps free up some of your pieces.\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:24.800\n So usually start with one pawn first\n\n39:24.800 --> 39:26.880\n and then you could start taking out your minor pieces,\n\n39:26.880 --> 39:28.160\n which is the bishop and the knight.\n\n39:28.160 --> 39:31.320\n I have anxiety about a pawn just floating out there.\n\n39:31.320 --> 39:32.680\n Defenseless.\n\n39:32.680 --> 39:34.440\n But it's not attacked yet.\n\n39:34.440 --> 39:36.080\n See, those are what you call ghost threats.\n\n39:36.080 --> 39:38.480\n So you're scared of something that hasn't happened yet.\n\n39:38.480 --> 39:40.120\n So if I were to attack it.\n\n39:40.120 --> 39:43.000\n Feel like there's a deeper thing going on here.\n\n39:43.000 --> 39:43.840\n Yeah.\n\n39:43.840 --> 39:44.680\n Actually, let's say.\n\n39:44.680 --> 39:47.440\n Yeah, so you're attacking the pawn in the center here\n\n39:47.440 --> 39:50.560\n and it is vulnerable, but as soon as you do that,\n\n39:50.560 --> 39:53.720\n I can develop my own knight and defend it as well.\n\n39:53.720 --> 39:54.560\n Okay.\n\n39:54.560 --> 39:55.380\n And now for people just listening,\n\n39:55.380 --> 39:58.600\n there's two pawns that just came out to meet each other\n\n39:58.600 --> 40:00.160\n and a couple of knights.\n\n40:00.160 --> 40:01.520\n You love the chess commentary.\n\n40:01.520 --> 40:02.360\n It's very poetic.\n\n40:02.360 --> 40:03.200\n Yeah.\n\n40:03.200 --> 40:04.920\n The pawns met after midnight.\n\n40:04.920 --> 40:06.000\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n40:06.000 --> 40:08.400\n Well, I'm going to romanticize the game a bit.\n\n40:08.400 --> 40:09.240\n Yes, exactly.\n\n40:09.240 --> 40:10.080\n Okay, cool.\n\n40:10.080 --> 40:14.280\n So like there's, if you bring out the bishops\n\n40:14.280 --> 40:16.760\n with the knights, you're matching that with the other.\n\n40:16.760 --> 40:18.200\n Black is going to match it.\n\n40:18.200 --> 40:19.040\n Exactly.\n\n40:19.040 --> 40:19.880\n Whatever you're attacking with.\n\n40:19.880 --> 40:20.700\n Yep, he's developing.\n\n40:20.700 --> 40:21.540\n It's going to defend it.\n\n40:21.540 --> 40:23.440\n Now you could develop your bishop\n\n40:23.440 --> 40:25.280\n or your knight, whatever you'd like.\n\n40:25.280 --> 40:27.280\n Oh no, now you give him options.\n\n40:27.280 --> 40:28.240\n All right.\n\n40:28.240 --> 40:30.000\n Yeah, there you go.\n\n40:30.000 --> 40:32.440\n Now I am attacking the pawn in the center,\n\n40:32.440 --> 40:34.580\n which is what you were afraid about before,\n\n40:34.580 --> 40:36.980\n but let's see how you defend it here.\n\n40:41.560 --> 40:43.680\n By doing this symmetrical thing,\n\n40:43.680 --> 40:45.680\n bringing out the knight on the other side.\n\n40:45.680 --> 40:48.080\n And actually your other move was good as well,\n\n40:48.080 --> 40:49.100\n defending with the pawn,\n\n40:49.100 --> 40:51.880\n because then you're freeing up space for your bishop.\n\n40:51.880 --> 40:54.520\n So you're basically trying to develop your pieces\n\n40:54.520 --> 40:57.480\n as quickly as possible, put your pawns in the center,\n\n40:57.480 --> 40:59.280\n and then get your king to safety.\n\n40:59.280 --> 41:03.080\n And that's usually the basic opening tips that you get.\n\n41:03.080 --> 41:05.060\n And it is kind of counterintuitive\n\n41:05.060 --> 41:09.120\n that safety is in the corner of the board for a king.\n\n41:09.120 --> 41:11.480\n That was always confusing to me, but you know.\n\n41:11.480 --> 41:12.800\n Three pawns in front,\n\n41:12.800 --> 41:15.360\n though you typically don't push those.\n\n41:15.360 --> 41:17.720\n Maybe like one, maybe I'll go one square,\n\n41:17.720 --> 41:21.080\n but these will be like the wall of defense\n\n41:21.080 --> 41:22.080\n that keep him safe.\n\n41:22.080 --> 41:24.080\n But another way to also think about it\n\n41:24.080 --> 41:28.080\n is your pieces usually wanna point towards the center.\n\n41:28.080 --> 41:29.860\n If you have a knight closer to the center\n\n41:29.860 --> 41:31.420\n than closer to the side,\n\n41:31.420 --> 41:34.080\n it actually has more squares it can go to.\n\n41:34.080 --> 41:37.240\n So a huge part of it is just wanting to have flexibility\n\n41:37.240 --> 41:38.640\n for where your pieces go.\n\n41:38.640 --> 41:42.200\n So more pieces are going to be able to make threats\n\n41:42.200 --> 41:45.200\n in the center or even open up the position.\n\n41:45.200 --> 41:48.460\n So since that's where it's most likely to open,\n\n41:48.460 --> 41:49.560\n you want your king somewhere\n\n41:49.560 --> 41:51.240\n where the position will stay closed\n\n41:51.240 --> 41:52.920\n so that you have the pawns to defend.\n\n41:52.920 --> 41:54.680\n You know, there's like rules like this,\n\n41:54.680 --> 41:55.800\n but I always wonder,\n\n41:55.800 --> 41:57.560\n cause I've built chess engines,\n\n41:57.560 --> 42:00.400\n but then you start to wonder like,\n\n42:00.400 --> 42:03.360\n why is it that positionally these things are good?\n\n42:03.360 --> 42:05.400\n Like you've built up an intuition about it,\n\n42:05.400 --> 42:08.360\n but I wish, and that's the thing that would be amazing\n\n42:08.360 --> 42:10.160\n if engines could explain,\n\n42:10.160 --> 42:13.320\n why is this kind of thing better than this kind of thing?\n\n42:13.320 --> 42:15.040\n You start to build up an intuition,\n\n42:15.040 --> 42:17.960\n but if I'm just like knowing nothing about chess,\n\n42:17.960 --> 42:21.280\n it feels confusing that cornering your king,\n\n42:21.280 --> 42:25.160\n like getting him like trapped here.\n\n42:25.160 --> 42:27.920\n Like it feels like you could get checkmated easier there\n\n42:27.920 --> 42:30.920\n if I was just using like dumb intuition,\n\n42:30.920 --> 42:33.380\n but it seems like that's not the case.\n\n42:33.380 --> 42:36.460\n I imagine maybe, cause AlphaZero learned\n\n42:36.460 --> 42:38.580\n by playing games against itself, right?\n\n42:38.580 --> 42:40.840\n And I imagine if you have a lot of games\n\n42:40.840 --> 42:42.360\n and you do build an intuition,\n\n42:42.360 --> 42:44.160\n because if you were to keep your king in the center,\n\n42:44.160 --> 42:45.400\n you just see that in those games,\n\n42:45.400 --> 42:48.460\n you're dealing with threats a lot more often.\n\n42:48.460 --> 42:50.320\n But yeah, there's shortcut rules\n\n42:50.320 --> 42:53.120\n and this doesn't even mean it's the best way to play chess\n\n42:53.120 --> 42:55.720\n as we've seen with AlphaZero\n\n42:55.720 --> 42:58.040\n kind of changing the rules of the game a little bit.\n\n42:58.040 --> 43:00.720\n But as a human, to learn it from scratch\n\n43:00.720 --> 43:03.320\n is a lot more difficult than to start with principles.\n\n43:03.320 --> 43:07.560\n So that's why beginners usually learn chess this way.\n\n43:07.560 --> 43:09.960\n Yeah, because you're playing other humans\n\n43:09.960 --> 43:11.960\n and the other humans have also operated\n\n43:11.960 --> 43:13.000\n on a different principles.\n\n43:13.000 --> 43:15.960\n And that's why people that come up now\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:17.640\n that are training with engines\n\n43:17.640 --> 43:20.400\n are just going to be much better\n\n43:20.400 --> 43:21.520\n than the people of the past\n\n43:21.520 --> 43:24.880\n because they're gonna try out weirder ideas\n\n43:24.880 --> 43:27.000\n that go against the principles of old.\n\n43:27.000 --> 43:29.020\n And they're gonna do like weird stuff,\n\n43:29.020 --> 43:30.840\n including sacrifices and stuff like that.\n\n43:30.840 --> 43:34.040\n Yeah, and I also think that's why AlphaZero was so shocking\n\n43:34.040 --> 43:37.320\n because Stockfish was using an opening database.\n\n43:37.320 --> 43:39.720\n So it was already based off of knowledge\n\n43:39.720 --> 43:41.880\n that humans have from playing chess for years\n\n43:41.880 --> 43:43.840\n that we just thought is how you're supposed to play.\n\n43:43.840 --> 43:45.300\n Whereas AlphaZero just learned\n\n43:45.300 --> 43:47.240\n from playing the game so many times\n\n43:47.240 --> 43:49.880\n and came up with very novel opening ideas.\n\n43:49.880 --> 43:52.000\n Were you impressed by AlphaZero?\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:53.200\n Have you seen some of the games?\n\n43:53.200 --> 43:54.480\n I have seen some of the games.\n\n43:54.480 --> 43:59.480\n I think impressed, bewildered, and motivated\n\n43:59.480 --> 44:01.400\n were the three things I experienced.\n\n44:01.400 --> 44:04.880\n I think Magnus said he was also impressed\n\n44:04.880 --> 44:09.000\n that it could easily be mistaken for creativity.\n\n44:09.000 --> 44:10.800\n That's his trash talk towards the AI.\n\n44:10.800 --> 44:12.340\n That was a beautiful sentence.\n\n44:12.340 --> 44:14.460\n I was listening to the podcast.\n\n44:14.460 --> 44:17.080\n I mean, as a human, I agree with him\n\n44:17.080 --> 44:18.400\n because you don't wanna give the machine\n\n44:18.400 --> 44:20.440\n the power of creativity,\n\n44:20.440 --> 44:25.440\n but if it looks creative, give it a compliment.\n\n44:25.680 --> 44:27.320\n That's fair.\n\n44:27.320 --> 44:29.280\n I know that you're being nice to the machines\n\n44:29.280 --> 44:32.160\n in case they are ever looking back through this.\n\n44:32.160 --> 44:33.200\n What else is there?\n\n44:33.200 --> 44:36.920\n What other principles are there for the opening?\n\n44:36.920 --> 44:39.840\n You can go a little bit more forward, let's say.\n\n44:39.840 --> 44:42.040\n Yeah, we can finish full development.\n\n44:42.040 --> 44:43.920\n Positions like this, let's just say\n\n44:43.920 --> 44:45.840\n you developed all of your pieces.\n\n44:45.840 --> 44:49.480\n So that's like a really nice,\n\n44:49.480 --> 44:51.680\n like nobody took any pieces\n\n44:51.680 --> 44:53.800\n and we're just in a nice positional thing.\n\n44:53.800 --> 44:56.880\n Yeah, so it's not actually a very accurate one.\n\n44:56.880 --> 44:59.160\n So I'm actually, I could put a different one on the board,\n\n44:59.160 --> 45:03.120\n but usually after you've developed all of your pieces,\n\n45:03.120 --> 45:05.480\n you wanna get your queen out a little bit\n\n45:05.480 --> 45:06.720\n to connect your rooks,\n\n45:06.720 --> 45:09.320\n and you also start thinking about certain pawn pushes\n\n45:09.320 --> 45:11.200\n and getting more space.\n\n45:11.200 --> 45:14.080\n But another good tip is just can you improve\n\n45:14.080 --> 45:15.840\n the position of your pieces?\n\n45:15.840 --> 45:16.920\n Think about timing.\n\n45:16.920 --> 45:19.000\n So if you've already moved a piece once\n\n45:19.000 --> 45:20.600\n and there's a piece that hasn't moved at all,\n\n45:20.600 --> 45:23.440\n then you wanna focus on the piece that hasn't moved at all\n\n45:23.440 --> 45:26.680\n to be able to have it more likely to jump into the game.\n\n45:26.680 --> 45:28.680\n Right, so don't move pieces multiple times.\n\n45:28.680 --> 45:29.520\n Exactly.\n\n45:29.520 --> 45:31.440\n Like try to move it to the most optimal position.\n\n45:31.440 --> 45:32.280\n Yeah.\n\n45:32.280 --> 45:33.400\n Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n45:33.400 --> 45:37.480\n What, so what's the Indian,\n\n45:37.480 --> 45:38.800\n I think we kind of went over it,\n\n45:38.800 --> 45:41.880\n but did you ever say why you like it so much?\n\n45:41.880 --> 45:42.720\n Because it's weird?\n\n45:42.720 --> 45:43.560\n Because it's king size?\n\n45:43.560 --> 45:48.200\n I liked it because it's a very fun, aggressive defense\n\n45:48.200 --> 45:51.960\n where you're just throwing your pieces towards white,\n\n45:51.960 --> 45:55.720\n and there's so many sacrificing opportunities.\n\n45:55.720 --> 45:56.640\n And for some reason,\n\n45:56.640 --> 45:59.560\n tactical games always feel like the most beautiful,\n\n45:59.560 --> 46:01.240\n the most satisfying,\n\n46:01.240 --> 46:03.120\n and that's what I liked about the King's Indian.\n\n46:03.120 --> 46:06.360\n But I also suffered a lot from this love\n\n46:06.360 --> 46:07.560\n because I would play things\n\n46:07.560 --> 46:09.440\n that are not necessarily correct,\n\n46:09.440 --> 46:11.040\n then my attack wouldn't pan out,\n\n46:11.040 --> 46:12.800\n and then I would just struggle the rest of the game\n\n46:12.800 --> 46:14.600\n having no play and just trying to defend.\n\n46:14.600 --> 46:15.440\n So if you're always attacking,\n\n46:15.440 --> 46:16.920\n Wikipedia also says that,\n\n46:16.920 --> 46:19.680\n that you're known for your attacking play.\n\n46:19.680 --> 46:22.560\n It's also known for losses according to Stanford.\n\n46:22.560 --> 46:23.800\n Okay, let's not bring that up.\n\n46:23.800 --> 46:25.600\n See Wikipedia doesn't talk trash,\n\n46:25.600 --> 46:27.560\n it just says nice things.\n\n46:27.560 --> 46:29.120\n Yeah, Wikipedia's a lot nicer.\n\n46:29.120 --> 46:32.640\n I actually played a lot of positional chess in classic\n\n46:32.640 --> 46:35.320\n because I really like the slow squeeze,\n\n46:35.320 --> 46:38.640\n but when I transitioned to playing a lot of online chess,\n\n46:38.640 --> 46:40.560\n it's almost as if I was looking\n\n46:40.560 --> 46:42.280\n for more instant gratification\n\n46:42.280 --> 46:44.240\n because it feels so much better\n\n46:44.240 --> 46:46.280\n to beat someone with an attack.\n\n46:46.280 --> 46:48.280\n And even if sometimes it doesn't pan out,\n\n46:48.280 --> 46:51.240\n I was okay with it because you get so many games in.\n\n46:51.240 --> 46:54.160\n So I think my style in online chess\n\n46:54.160 --> 46:56.280\n really changed from my classical chess.\n\n46:56.280 --> 46:57.120\n What about you Andrea?\n\n46:57.120 --> 46:58.160\n Do you have a style?\n\n46:58.160 --> 46:59.120\n Are you attacking?\n\n46:59.120 --> 47:02.720\n Are you a more like conservative defensive player?\n\n47:02.720 --> 47:03.640\n Are you chaotic?\n\n47:03.640 --> 47:06.200\n Opening wise, I like to play more positionally.\n\n47:06.200 --> 47:09.680\n Like I like to push T4 and just slowly improve my pieces\n\n47:09.680 --> 47:10.720\n and slowly get an attack.\n\n47:10.720 --> 47:13.400\n But like Alex said, if you're playing bullet chess\n\n47:13.400 --> 47:15.440\n or blitz against viewers,\n\n47:15.440 --> 47:19.160\n you often like wanna play riskier moves\n\n47:19.160 --> 47:20.640\n that may not be as good.\n\n47:20.640 --> 47:23.080\n And then that's kind of when I would play more aggressive.\n\n47:23.080 --> 47:25.320\n But I do enjoy tournaments for that reason\n\n47:25.320 --> 47:29.120\n because then like once you're 15 moves in,\n\n47:29.120 --> 47:31.400\n which as soon as you're out of your prep,\n\n47:31.400 --> 47:33.800\n I like sitting and thinking in more positional,\n\n47:34.880 --> 47:37.200\n yeah, positional middle games.\n\n47:37.200 --> 47:39.840\n One of the games you found to be pretty cool\n\n47:39.840 --> 47:44.800\n was the Hakara Nakamura versus Galfan in 2009.\n\n47:44.800 --> 47:47.680\n And that one I think includes the King's Indian defense.\n\n47:47.680 --> 47:48.520\n Yes.\n\n47:49.800 --> 47:52.240\n Why is that an interesting one to you?\n\n47:52.240 --> 47:54.160\n I also play the King's Indian as black\n\n47:54.160 --> 47:56.240\n and I love this model game.\n\n47:56.240 --> 47:58.160\n But as Alex was saying,\n\n47:58.160 --> 48:00.440\n like all these advantages for the King's Indian.\n\n48:00.440 --> 48:02.160\n But now there's this one line\n\n48:02.160 --> 48:04.360\n that like every higher rated player\n\n48:04.360 --> 48:06.600\n just destroys my King's Indian.\n\n48:06.600 --> 48:08.560\n And you see these beautiful games and like,\n\n48:08.560 --> 48:10.640\n ah, yes, I wanna play for these ideas.\n\n48:10.640 --> 48:12.280\n But now no one plays into it anymore\n\n48:12.280 --> 48:13.440\n and you just get demolished.\n\n48:13.440 --> 48:15.360\n So this is why I don't play the King's Indian anymore,\n\n48:15.360 --> 48:16.400\n but not to ruin the fun.\n\n48:16.400 --> 48:18.280\n It's a love hate relationship, truly.\n\n48:18.280 --> 48:19.320\n The reality.\n\n48:19.320 --> 48:21.000\n But that's like the higher level players do\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:21.840\n or does everybody?\n\n48:21.840 --> 48:23.520\n Yeah, if you're studying openings\n\n48:23.520 --> 48:25.440\n and you know this line as white,\n\n48:25.440 --> 48:27.960\n you just, you automatically get the upper edge.\n\n48:27.960 --> 48:29.760\n And that's kind of how openings develop.\n\n48:29.760 --> 48:32.840\n You start having players trying new lines\n\n48:32.840 --> 48:35.200\n and then you see ones and then everybody adopts it\n\n48:35.200 --> 48:36.600\n if they think it's the best one.\n\n48:36.600 --> 48:38.520\n But yeah, so Hikaru is really known\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:41.000\n for his aggressive style of play.\n\n48:41.000 --> 48:42.160\n Is Hikaru black here or what?\n\n48:42.160 --> 48:43.240\n Yeah, Hikaru is black here.\n\n48:43.240 --> 48:45.240\n So he's playing the King's Indian.\n\n48:45.240 --> 48:47.560\n And as you can see in this position,\n\n48:47.560 --> 48:51.320\n white already has a lot, a huge center advantage.\n\n48:51.320 --> 48:52.880\n But what Hikaru is gonna start doing\n\n48:52.880 --> 48:56.040\n even with the next move is bringing all of his pieces\n\n48:56.040 --> 48:57.640\n towards the white King side,\n\n48:57.640 --> 49:00.520\n because his plan is to start pushing his pawns\n\n49:00.520 --> 49:03.320\n towards the white King and ignore the attack\n\n49:03.320 --> 49:04.160\n that goes on in the Queen side.\n\n49:04.160 --> 49:06.880\n It's all of the dream attack with the King's Indian.\n\n49:06.880 --> 49:09.920\n So there's a complete asymmetry towards the King side\n\n49:09.920 --> 49:12.640\n and the left side of the board is a ton of pieces.\n\n49:12.640 --> 49:13.720\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n49:14.920 --> 49:17.360\n Wow, he moved the knight like three times in a row.\n\n49:17.360 --> 49:19.080\n Yep, and that's what you need to do\n\n49:19.080 --> 49:20.560\n because you have to move the knight\n\n49:20.560 --> 49:22.600\n in order to make space for your pawn.\n\n49:22.600 --> 49:24.800\n So again, this is why it's so counterintuitive\n\n49:24.800 --> 49:26.360\n and Stockfish doesn't like it.\n\n49:26.360 --> 49:29.680\n You're putting almost most of your pieces on the back rank\n\n49:29.680 --> 49:31.560\n and you're pushing your King side pawns\n\n49:31.560 --> 49:33.520\n and you're blocking your own dark squared Bishop.\n\n49:33.520 --> 49:35.400\n So none of it makes sense.\n\n49:35.400 --> 49:37.760\n You're mimicking it, that's awesome.\n\n49:37.760 --> 49:39.640\n Okay, so yeah, here you see white going\n\n49:39.640 --> 49:40.880\n for a Queen side attack,\n\n49:40.880 --> 49:42.640\n black going for the King side attack\n\n49:42.640 --> 49:43.960\n and you can keep going a little bit\n\n49:43.960 --> 49:47.720\n and I'll wait to where he starts with the pretty sacrifices.\n\n49:47.720 --> 49:50.280\n It's more fun to analyze games in person\n\n49:50.280 --> 49:51.480\n than on the computer, I think.\n\n49:51.480 --> 49:52.320\n Yeah.\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:57.320\n Okay, so here Hikaru is preparing the attack\n\n49:57.320 --> 49:59.160\n and what I really like about this game\n\n49:59.160 --> 50:01.600\n is that he finds these tactics\n\n50:01.600 --> 50:05.200\n that are not necessarily what a computer would go for\n\n50:05.200 --> 50:07.720\n but it's very hard to face as a human\n\n50:07.720 --> 50:09.880\n and that's why a lot of people play the King's Indian\n\n50:09.880 --> 50:12.120\n because in practice it's hard to defend against.\n\n50:12.120 --> 50:14.360\n So we can keep moving a little bit forward.\n\n50:16.680 --> 50:17.520\n Okay.\n\n50:19.040 --> 50:21.760\n Yep, so white is just continuing the King side plan.\n\n50:21.760 --> 50:23.960\n No, is that like the first piece\n\n50:23.960 --> 50:25.240\n I think that's taken in the game?\n\n50:25.240 --> 50:26.560\n Yep, that's the first trade.\n\n50:26.560 --> 50:27.920\n Attack begins.\n\n50:27.920 --> 50:30.760\n Exactly, Hikaru had to pause his attack for a little bit\n\n50:30.760 --> 50:33.120\n to just make sure that white didn't have\n\n50:33.120 --> 50:35.280\n two dire threats on the Queen side.\n\n50:35.280 --> 50:37.560\n So cool to see the asymmetry of this thing.\n\n50:37.560 --> 50:39.960\n Exactly, that's what's beautiful about the King's Indian.\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:41.360\n And just one thing to highlight\n\n50:41.360 --> 50:44.240\n because his rook move here is very bizarre\n\n50:44.240 --> 50:47.040\n and typically like a computer probably didn't like this\n\n50:47.040 --> 50:48.880\n but the ideas are interesting\n\n50:48.880 --> 50:51.120\n because this is a major weakness for black\n\n50:51.120 --> 50:52.480\n that they're coming to attack\n\n50:52.480 --> 50:54.640\n and he's also making room for his Bishop\n\n50:54.640 --> 50:56.120\n to come backwards and challenge.\n\n50:56.120 --> 50:58.160\n So this is like a human like maneuver\n\n50:58.160 --> 50:59.000\n that computers would like.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.480\n I think computers would like this though\n\n51:00.480 --> 51:02.440\n because you'd have to move it regardless\n\n51:02.440 --> 51:03.920\n because he takes the pawn here\n\n51:03.920 --> 51:05.720\n and his rook would be under attack.\n\n51:05.720 --> 51:07.840\n Yeah, well having looked at it,\n\n51:07.840 --> 51:09.360\n when I actually studied this as a line\n\n51:09.360 --> 51:11.720\n and this right away isn't the best move cutting computer.\n\n51:11.720 --> 51:13.360\n So actually that's such a good question.\n\n51:13.360 --> 51:15.520\n So do you guys when you study games use your mind\n\n51:15.520 --> 51:19.440\n but do you also use computers to build up your intuition\n\n51:19.440 --> 51:20.920\n of like looking at a position like this\n\n51:20.920 --> 51:22.400\n and what would a computer do\n\n51:22.400 --> 51:24.840\n and then try to understand why it wants to do that?\n\n51:24.840 --> 51:26.600\n When I was studying seriously\n\n51:26.600 --> 51:28.600\n I would try to use my own mind\n\n51:28.600 --> 51:31.400\n because you're never gonna get the exact same position\n\n51:31.400 --> 51:33.560\n so you really need to notice trends\n\n51:33.560 --> 51:35.280\n and often computers will give you moves\n\n51:35.280 --> 51:38.040\n that are only specific to that position\n\n51:38.040 --> 51:40.320\n because of a certain tactic.\n\n51:40.320 --> 51:43.000\n But I do use computers to check what I did\n\n51:43.000 --> 51:44.760\n and make sure I didn't make any obvious blunder\n\n51:44.760 --> 51:45.960\n that I might have missed.\n\n51:45.960 --> 51:47.000\n What does a computer tell you?\n\n51:47.000 --> 51:49.040\n Just like what is the best move\n\n51:49.040 --> 51:52.560\n or does it give you any kind of explanation of why?\n\n51:52.560 --> 51:54.080\n It doesn't tell you why\n\n51:54.080 --> 51:57.040\n but it gives you the different valuations of the position\n\n51:57.040 --> 52:01.200\n like black is down a half pawn here or something like that\n\n52:02.120 --> 52:04.560\n but it hints you towards what the right move is\n\n52:04.560 --> 52:06.640\n and then it's on you to figure out why\n\n52:06.640 --> 52:09.280\n and you can usually figure out why if not right away\n\n52:09.280 --> 52:10.680\n then just by going through a few moves\n\n52:10.680 --> 52:12.840\n and being like, oh, okay, that makes sense.\n\n52:12.840 --> 52:15.040\n I feel like a computer will take you down\n\n52:15.040 --> 52:18.560\n with some weird lines potentially like sacrifice.\n\n52:18.560 --> 52:20.960\n Like why the hell am I sacrificing this?\n\n52:20.960 --> 52:23.320\n Well, we'll get to the pretty sacrifice soon.\n\n52:24.520 --> 52:25.800\n So we could just keep playing.\n\n52:25.800 --> 52:27.480\n The pawns are being pushed forward.\n\n52:27.480 --> 52:31.760\n Yeah, and Hikaru is kind of ignoring\n\n52:31.760 --> 52:33.800\n the queen side attack here.\n\n52:33.800 --> 52:37.240\n They basically both only reply to each other's plan\n\n52:37.240 --> 52:38.280\n when they have to.\n\n52:39.400 --> 52:41.920\n This is where you convert all the podcast viewers\n\n52:41.920 --> 52:43.160\n to YouTube.\n\n52:43.160 --> 52:44.000\n Yeah.\n\n52:44.000 --> 52:46.200\n They have no idea what we're talking about right now.\n\n52:46.200 --> 52:48.160\n There is a Zen like experience\n\n52:48.160 --> 52:50.280\n of just like listening and imagining.\n\n52:50.280 --> 52:51.120\n The board.\n\n52:51.120 --> 52:52.960\n Just imagine the pieces on the ceiling.\n\n52:52.960 --> 52:55.240\n Yeah, we should be calling them out\n\n52:55.240 --> 52:56.880\n and then people will be freaking out even more.\n\n52:56.880 --> 52:59.600\n Am I supposed to keep track of what the position is?\n\n52:59.600 --> 53:01.600\n It's too late now.\n\n53:01.600 --> 53:02.440\n It's too many.\n\n53:02.440 --> 53:03.440\n How hard is blindfold chess?\n\n53:03.440 --> 53:04.280\n Have you tried?\n\n53:04.280 --> 53:05.600\n Like are you able to keep the mind?\n\n53:05.600 --> 53:07.480\n I've played blindfold chess before.\n\n53:08.400 --> 53:09.680\n For me, it's pretty hard.\n\n53:09.680 --> 53:11.360\n It's not a muscle that I've trained as much\n\n53:11.360 --> 53:13.560\n and I'm very visual when it comes to chess.\n\n53:14.640 --> 53:16.880\n But it is one as a top player\n\n53:16.880 --> 53:20.080\n that starts becoming very second nature for you.\n\n53:20.080 --> 53:23.080\n Actually, this is what, I talked to Magnus about this.\n\n53:23.080 --> 53:26.440\n Maybe I was, again, influenced by Queen's Gambit.\n\n53:26.440 --> 53:29.160\n What do you actually visualize when it's in your head?\n\n53:29.160 --> 53:31.360\n So for Magnus, it was a boring 2D board.\n\n53:31.360 --> 53:32.200\n Right.\n\n53:32.200 --> 53:33.040\n Do you have some kind of?\n\n53:33.040 --> 53:34.720\n That's every chess player, no.\n\n53:34.720 --> 53:35.560\n You don't have like,\n\n53:35.560 --> 53:38.520\n cause you know some chess like computer games,\n\n53:38.520 --> 53:41.800\n you can do all kinds of skins and like fancy stuff.\n\n53:41.800 --> 53:42.640\n You don't have any fancy stuff?\n\n53:42.640 --> 53:45.920\n Sadly, I don't have like a cool 3D warrior mode on.\n\n53:45.920 --> 53:46.760\n It's just the basic.\n\n53:46.760 --> 53:49.040\n I just have the default chess base board in my head.\n\n53:49.040 --> 53:51.840\n Cause you don't, yeah, you can't use your brain power\n\n53:51.840 --> 53:53.240\n for adding colors to it\n\n53:53.240 --> 53:55.280\n cause you already have to keep track of the pieces.\n\n53:55.280 --> 53:56.920\n And it's one board at a time?\n\n53:56.920 --> 53:57.760\n Yes.\n\n53:57.760 --> 53:58.600\n Okay.\n\n53:58.600 --> 53:59.440\n The current position.\n\n53:59.440 --> 54:00.280\n Yeah, I bet every chess.\n\n54:00.280 --> 54:01.840\n I wonder if there's any who hit it differently.\n\n54:01.840 --> 54:04.440\n There's certain players who are really good\n\n54:04.440 --> 54:06.280\n and they can even play blindfold chess\n\n54:06.280 --> 54:08.520\n and play multiple games at the same time.\n\n54:09.640 --> 54:11.440\n So I would be curious how they do it.\n\n54:11.440 --> 54:13.160\n But usually when you're thinking of one game,\n\n54:13.160 --> 54:14.960\n that's the only one in your mind.\n\n54:14.960 --> 54:16.480\n Yeah, but you have to do this operation\n\n54:16.480 --> 54:18.640\n where you move one piece.\n\n54:18.640 --> 54:22.360\n You're doing like the branch analysis.\n\n54:22.360 --> 54:27.360\n Like, and so you still have to somehow visualize\n\n54:27.440 --> 54:31.360\n the branching process and not forget stuff.\n\n54:31.360 --> 54:34.640\n Maybe that's like constant memory recall or something.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:36.640\n You're always looking at one board at a time, but.\n\n54:36.640 --> 54:38.880\n And you're also, oh, cause you're also looking in the future.\n\n54:38.880 --> 54:39.720\n Yeah.\n\n54:39.720 --> 54:40.560\n Cause then you have to back track.\n\n54:40.560 --> 54:41.400\n Calculating variations and coming back.\n\n54:41.400 --> 54:44.120\n I guess you're keeping the position in your memory.\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:45.920\n So you're remembering where all the pieces are\n\n54:45.920 --> 54:48.240\n and then you're playing it out on one board\n\n54:48.240 --> 54:50.720\n and then you can come back to the initial one\n\n54:50.720 --> 54:52.600\n that you started with that you kind of just keep\n\n54:52.600 --> 54:55.280\n in your brain and it's also easier to come back to it\n\n54:55.280 --> 54:57.600\n once you've played a position from it.\n\n54:57.600 --> 55:02.600\n I feel like it's that memory recall\n\n55:03.040 --> 55:04.760\n that gets you to blunder.\n\n55:04.760 --> 55:09.120\n So I'll like see that I'm being attacked by certain things,\n\n55:09.120 --> 55:11.840\n but then because I get so exhausted thinking\n\n55:11.840 --> 55:13.640\n about a different thing, I forget,\n\n55:13.640 --> 55:16.480\n I actually forget about an entire branch of things\n\n55:16.480 --> 55:17.800\n that I was supposed to be worried about.\n\n55:17.800 --> 55:18.920\n It happens very often.\n\n55:18.920 --> 55:19.760\n Yeah.\n\n55:19.760 --> 55:22.320\n If you spend a bunch of time calculating in a position,\n\n55:22.320 --> 55:24.160\n let's say like when you're really in trouble\n\n55:24.160 --> 55:26.800\n and you're spending 15, 20 minutes calculating,\n\n55:26.800 --> 55:29.000\n you'll forget about something that you spotted like,\n\n55:29.000 --> 55:32.080\n oh, if I do these two, three moves, I'll walk into a trap\n\n55:32.080 --> 55:34.040\n cause you've looked at so many lines and then you play it\n\n55:34.040 --> 55:36.440\n and then you see it and you're like, oh, I looked at it\n\n55:36.440 --> 55:39.000\n and I saw it, but I forgot about it.\n\n55:39.000 --> 55:41.760\n It's often called tunneling where you're just looking\n\n55:41.760 --> 55:43.880\n so deeply on one thing you forget about the rest\n\n55:43.880 --> 55:45.120\n of the board.\n\n55:45.120 --> 55:47.920\n And it's the worst when, at least in a beginner level,\n\n55:47.920 --> 55:51.320\n there's like a, I don't know, a Bishop just sitting there,\n\n55:51.320 --> 55:54.640\n obviously attacking your like queen or something.\n\n55:54.640 --> 55:57.600\n And then you just forget that Bishop exists.\n\n55:57.600 --> 55:59.480\n Cause if they just sit there for a few moves\n\n55:59.480 --> 56:02.880\n and don't move, you just forget their existence.\n\n56:02.880 --> 56:05.720\n And then it's just, yeah, that's definitely very embarrassing.\n\n56:05.720 --> 56:07.520\n Well, it happens to everyone, so.\n\n56:08.560 --> 56:09.400\n Yes.\n\n56:10.320 --> 56:11.440\n Okay, cool.\n\n56:11.440 --> 56:16.040\n Okay, so we see a few trades happening on the queen side\n\n56:16.040 --> 56:18.960\n where he had to go for those, otherwise he's in trouble.\n\n56:18.960 --> 56:22.200\n And this is where the game, oh, sorry.\n\n56:22.200 --> 56:23.960\n This is where it gets exciting.\n\n56:23.960 --> 56:28.840\n Yeah, so Knight H4 is really when the sacrifice starts.\n\n56:28.840 --> 56:33.320\n And here the two important pawns are the ones in front\n\n56:33.320 --> 56:35.880\n of the King, cause they're helping with the entire defense\n\n56:35.880 --> 56:38.800\n and Hikaru is actually preparing to sacrifice his Knight\n\n56:38.800 --> 56:42.440\n for a pawn just so that he can continue his attack\n\n56:42.440 --> 56:43.800\n and open up the position.\n\n56:43.800 --> 56:45.760\n Because if you don't do that here as black\n\n56:45.760 --> 56:47.040\n and don't get some kind of attack,\n\n56:47.040 --> 56:49.320\n you are completely lost on the queen side.\n\n56:49.320 --> 56:51.920\n And also you've pushed all of your own king side pawns,\n\n56:51.920 --> 56:53.120\n so you're gonna be in danger.\n\n56:53.120 --> 56:55.760\n So it's one of those do or die moments.\n\n56:55.760 --> 56:57.680\n Oh, okay, so that's what makes it all in,\n\n56:57.680 --> 56:58.880\n cause the King is wide open.\n\n56:58.880 --> 57:01.080\n Yeah, yeah, the King is wide open\n\n57:01.080 --> 57:03.880\n and all of White's pieces are pointed\n\n57:03.880 --> 57:06.080\n towards the queen side too, where you're also cramped.\n\n57:06.080 --> 57:08.200\n So is the attack primarily by black done\n\n57:08.200 --> 57:10.320\n by the two pawns and the Knight?\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:13.160\n And the light squared Bishop is always extremely important.\n\n57:13.160 --> 57:15.240\n So you don't wanna trade this in the King's Indian\n\n57:15.240 --> 57:18.480\n because it's very helpful for a lot of attacks.\n\n57:18.480 --> 57:19.960\n Even though it's on the other side of the board,\n\n57:19.960 --> 57:22.280\n I guess it can go all the way across in,\n\n57:23.200 --> 57:25.160\n like I'm not sure what it's doing here,\n\n57:25.160 --> 57:26.080\n but probably threatening.\n\n57:26.080 --> 57:29.240\n Like for example, if it was another move black\n\n57:29.240 --> 57:32.000\n could have played would be something like Bishop H3,\n\n57:32.000 --> 57:33.200\n where if you take the Bishop,\n\n57:33.200 --> 57:35.440\n you actually get mated on G2.\n\n57:35.440 --> 57:36.280\n With what?\n\n57:36.280 --> 57:37.480\n So let's say you take here\n\n57:37.480 --> 57:39.200\n and then you could push the pawn\n\n57:39.200 --> 57:40.920\n and then it would be checkmate.\n\n57:40.920 --> 57:44.480\n So you're kind of using your Bishop to sacrifice\n\n57:44.480 --> 57:47.400\n against White's King side pawns.\n\n57:47.400 --> 57:50.840\n Yeah, I'll be freaking out if their Bishop did that.\n\n57:50.840 --> 57:51.800\n What are they up to?\n\n57:51.800 --> 57:53.200\n Right, and that's the thing,\n\n57:53.200 --> 57:55.320\n this position looks very scary as White\n\n57:55.320 --> 57:57.200\n because all of Black's pawns are starting\n\n57:57.200 --> 57:58.560\n to come towards you.\n\n57:58.560 --> 58:01.000\n And it's one of those things where humans\n\n58:01.000 --> 58:03.040\n do start to worry in these positions,\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:05.200\n whereas computers obviously can just calculate\n\n58:05.200 --> 58:07.520\n the best line and maybe the attack doesn't go through.\n\n58:07.520 --> 58:09.200\n So you're saying the computer might say\n\n58:09.200 --> 58:12.160\n that the White is actually a slight favorite here?\n\n58:12.160 --> 58:13.680\n Yeah, potentially.\n\n58:13.680 --> 58:17.040\n Okay, so then White makes a little bit of room\n\n58:17.040 --> 58:18.160\n by moving the Rook.\n\n58:18.160 --> 58:19.000\n Right.\n\n58:19.000 --> 58:20.360\n And the attack begins.\n\n58:20.360 --> 58:21.760\n I like the commentary here.\n\n58:23.160 --> 58:26.200\n The Knight is hugging the King.\n\n58:26.200 --> 58:28.800\n And actually White can't even take the King here\n\n58:28.800 --> 58:31.360\n because then H4 and H3 is coming in.\n\n58:31.360 --> 58:32.640\n White can't take the Knight.\n\n58:32.640 --> 58:33.840\n Yeah, oh did I say King?\n\n58:33.840 --> 58:35.080\n Yes, thank you, the Knight.\n\n58:35.080 --> 58:37.440\n White can't take the Knight because why?\n\n58:37.440 --> 58:39.360\n So if White takes the Knight here,\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:41.960\n then Black starts pushing his pawn to H4\n\n58:41.960 --> 58:45.360\n with H3 incoming and the idea of trying\n\n58:45.360 --> 58:49.760\n to defend against this is, it looks very difficult.\n\n58:49.760 --> 58:51.200\n So White just chooses.\n\n58:51.200 --> 58:53.200\n It'd be cool to watch a chess game,\n\n58:53.200 --> 58:55.960\n to experience watching it without understanding it\n\n58:55.960 --> 58:57.080\n just for a day.\n\n58:57.080 --> 58:59.440\n Feel like I could use that to make better content.\n\n58:59.440 --> 59:00.280\n True.\n\n59:01.320 --> 59:02.160\n Okay.\n\n59:02.160 --> 59:03.240\n I mean, that's what getting drunk does.\n\n59:03.240 --> 59:05.720\n Unfortunately for chess players,\n\n59:05.720 --> 59:07.600\n it never leaves your brain.\n\n59:07.600 --> 59:08.880\n Doesn't matter how.\n\n59:08.880 --> 59:10.840\n But this is actually a very cute move\n\n59:10.840 --> 59:13.480\n because Black's Queen is under attack,\n\n59:13.480 --> 59:16.880\n but the King is so cramped that he can't actually take it\n\n59:16.880 --> 59:18.680\n or he's gonna get checkmated by a pawn,\n\n59:18.680 --> 59:20.920\n which is a sad way to go cruelly.\n\n59:20.920 --> 59:23.200\n Yeah, those pawns are doing a lot of work here.\n\n59:23.200 --> 59:24.040\n They really are.\n\n59:24.040 --> 59:24.880\n That is the King's Indian.\n\n59:24.880 --> 59:26.720\n This is the King's Indian player's dream.\n\n59:26.720 --> 59:29.120\n The attack of the King side pawns.\n\n59:29.120 --> 59:31.240\n Yeah, these pawns are like, right,\n\n59:31.240 --> 59:32.720\n so they're the ones that are doing a lot\n\n59:32.720 --> 59:33.840\n of the threatening.\n\n59:33.840 --> 59:35.960\n Right, and they're also opening up the position\n\n59:35.960 --> 59:37.640\n to bring more of the pieces in.\n\n59:37.640 --> 59:41.560\n But the pawns kind of help break open the King side,\n\n59:41.560 --> 59:43.560\n but they can't checkmate by themselves.\n\n59:43.560 --> 59:44.880\n So after the pawns come in,\n\n59:44.880 --> 59:46.760\n that's when you need to start bringing in pieces as well,\n\n59:46.760 --> 59:49.360\n which you will see Ahi Kar do here.\n\n59:49.360 --> 59:50.200\n Okay. There you go.\n\n59:50.200 --> 59:52.000\n He puts. One more sacrifice.\n\n59:52.000 --> 59:55.200\n This was actually another beautiful sacrifice in the game.\n\n59:56.360 --> 59:59.040\n But then puts the King in check with a pawn.\n\n59:59.040 --> 1:00:02.080\n Right, and the pawn is going to be given here for free,\n\n1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:04.180\n but the idea is you're giving your own piece\n\n1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:07.660\n because you want to have more space and open up the King,\n\n1:00:07.660 --> 1:00:09.260\n which is what you're always trying to do\n\n1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:10.100\n when you have a King side.\n\n1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:12.180\n You're trying to remove as many of the King's defenders\n\n1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:14.600\n as you can without giving up too much.\n\n1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:17.680\n And then you have a ton of pieces on the King side\n\n1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:20.360\n for black, just waiting to.\n\n1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:21.400\n Exactly.\n\n1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:22.480\n To do harm.\n\n1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:23.320\n And then.\n\n1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:25.400\n And notice how every single move,\n\n1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:26.840\n white is getting attacked.\n\n1:00:26.840 --> 1:00:28.480\n Like they're just never getting a break.\n\n1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:30.000\n Black just keeps throwing all their pieces.\n\n1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:32.520\n So it's funny that black's Queen has been hanging\n\n1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:33.920\n for like three moves now\n\n1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:36.160\n and white still can't do anything about it.\n\n1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:38.520\n So rook puts the King in check.\n\n1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:40.200\n The King runs.\n\n1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:44.000\n And then again, we leave the Queen hanging\n\n1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.160\n and you develop a piece,\n\n1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:46.900\n this light squared Bishop that's so important,\n\n1:00:46.900 --> 1:00:50.040\n and you're once again threatening checkmate on G2.\n\n1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.600\n And then Bishops coming to the game.\n\n1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:55.880\n Once again, the Queen hanging.\n\n1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:57.520\n I mean, the game is just so beautiful.\n\n1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:02.520\n The amount of calculation Hikaru put into this position.\n\n1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:04.320\n It feels like so much is in danger.\n\n1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:05.160\n Right.\n\n1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:06.000\n It's so interesting.\n\n1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.040\n And Knight takes what?\n\n1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:09.880\n A pawns.\n\n1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:12.160\n So now his Queen is attacked twice\n\n1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:13.920\n and he doesn't care.\n\n1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:14.880\n He takes the Bishop\n\n1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:17.800\n and he's still threatening the checkmate on G2.\n\n1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:21.960\n And then the Queen takes the Bishop.\n\n1:01:21.960 --> 1:01:24.320\n So now he's defending against G2\n\n1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:29.320\n and black just goes and grabs some material back here.\n\n1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:32.400\n So here, black is already is winning.\n\n1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:34.200\n Well, he ends up winning a Knight here\n\n1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:37.240\n because black had to be so much on the defensive.\n\n1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:39.400\n He's just taking pieces.\n\n1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:40.440\n Yeah, I mean at this point,\n\n1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.880\n you're up two whole pieces.\n\n1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:43.000\n So you knew it was in here.\n\n1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.280\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:45.120\n But.\n\n1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:47.760\n And Queen.\n\n1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:48.600\n Queen.\n\n1:01:49.440 --> 1:01:51.420\n And then you take,\n\n1:01:51.420 --> 1:01:53.240\n and then the rook takes\n\n1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:56.720\n and there's not as much of an attack on the King anymore,\n\n1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:59.720\n but Hikaru is up a Knight here,\n\n1:01:59.720 --> 1:02:01.880\n which is GG.\n\n1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:04.840\n Yeah, what's the correct way of saying that?\n\n1:02:04.840 --> 1:02:07.520\n Because I played Demis Hassabis.\n\n1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:09.000\n I played him in chess.\n\n1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:13.400\n And then I quickly realized like from his facial expressions\n\n1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:16.520\n that I should have like stopped playing.\n\n1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:17.360\n Oh.\n\n1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:19.000\n It was like, it's already set.\n\n1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000\n Yeah, when it's.\n\n1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.960\n And then he's like, like, this is the good time to like,\n\n1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:24.800\n give up.\n\n1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:25.640\n Right.\n\n1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:27.400\n You're not gonna get to checkmate where like this,\n\n1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.000\n you know, he could see like,\n\n1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:32.440\n the checkmate is like five or seven moves away or something.\n\n1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:34.800\n And what's the play?\n\n1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:38.720\n Usually you have to resign if you're in a position\n\n1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:41.800\n or you should through chess etiquette resign\n\n1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:44.760\n when you're in a position where your opponent\n\n1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:46.640\n is definitely gonna win out of respect.\n\n1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:48.520\n Like if you're a piece down.\n\n1:02:48.520 --> 1:02:51.640\n And obviously all top grandmasters do that.\n\n1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.880\n The only people who don't do that is kids\n\n1:02:53.880 --> 1:02:54.720\n because their coaches.\n\n1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:55.560\n They love to play till the checkmate.\n\n1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:57.760\n Their coaches always tell them never resign\n\n1:02:57.760 --> 1:02:59.840\n and they'll be in hopelessly lost positions\n\n1:02:59.840 --> 1:03:02.440\n playing against like two rooks, a king,\n\n1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:03.960\n and they only have their sole king,\n\n1:03:03.960 --> 1:03:05.760\n but they're still playing on.\n\n1:03:05.760 --> 1:03:08.000\n So that's a position where it's obvious they can't win.\n\n1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.600\n Because the kids might make errors.\n\n1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:10.440\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:11.440\n And so it might as well.\n\n1:03:11.440 --> 1:03:12.800\n That was the interesting thing about,\n\n1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:15.720\n I think game six of the previous world championship\n\n1:03:15.720 --> 1:03:16.720\n with Magnus.\n\n1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:18.400\n Was it the one where he beat Nap?\n\n1:03:18.400 --> 1:03:20.360\n Yeah, the first time he beat him,\n\n1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.600\n where it was like, he said that,\n\n1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:26.000\n I don't know how often you come across\n\n1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:26.840\n this kind of situation.\n\n1:03:26.840 --> 1:03:29.520\n He said, the engines predict a draw,\n\n1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:33.360\n but that doesn't mean that it's going to be a draw.\n\n1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:38.360\n So you play on hoping that you take a person into,\n\n1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:40.480\n I mean, this is, I guess, an end game thing.\n\n1:03:40.480 --> 1:03:41.640\n You take them to deep water\n\n1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:43.840\n and they make a positional mistake or something.\n\n1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:47.360\n I don't know when, like he from his gut knows\n\n1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:48.680\n that this is supposed to be a draw,\n\n1:03:48.680 --> 1:03:50.000\n but he still plays on.\n\n1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.520\n Yeah, I mean, that is one where\n\n1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:54.600\n it could theoretically be a draw,\n\n1:03:54.600 --> 1:03:56.840\n but it could be very hard to defend\n\n1:03:56.840 --> 1:03:59.680\n because it's a hard technique to know as a human.\n\n1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:01.120\n And especially in that game,\n\n1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:04.080\n I know that Nepo was also in time pressure,\n\n1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:05.640\n which makes it even harder.\n\n1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:07.920\n So in situations like that, you should always continue.\n\n1:04:07.920 --> 1:04:10.160\n It's more where an engine would give you something\n\n1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:14.440\n like plus 10 or something where it's not just clearly a win,\n\n1:04:14.440 --> 1:04:16.000\n but anybody would know how to win.\n\n1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:18.840\n And that's where you're usually supposed to resign.\n\n1:04:18.840 --> 1:04:20.800\n So what do you find beautiful about this game?\n\n1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:25.800\n Is it the attacking chess and just the asymmetry of it?\n\n1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:28.920\n It's the asymmetry.\n\n1:04:28.920 --> 1:04:32.440\n And it's the fact that this is the dream\n\n1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:34.040\n for the King's Indian,\n\n1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:36.320\n where you're able to get a beautiful attack.\n\n1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:40.100\n And there was also those two really nice sacrifices\n\n1:04:40.100 --> 1:04:43.560\n where Black just continuously kept putting pressure\n\n1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:45.680\n on White's King to the point where he was able\n\n1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.100\n to win material.\n\n1:04:47.100 --> 1:04:50.120\n And the best part of it is that if the attack didn't work\n\n1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:52.280\n out, Black would have been completely lost.\n\n1:04:53.560 --> 1:04:54.960\n How often does that happen, by the way?\n\n1:04:54.960 --> 1:04:56.360\n Like as an attacking player,\n\n1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:59.780\n how often do you put yourself in the position of like,\n\n1:04:59.780 --> 1:05:01.760\n I'm screwed unless this works out?\n\n1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:04.080\n In online chess more than I should.\n\n1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:05.760\n And it's usually when I sacrifice,\n\n1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:08.440\n I know it's either gonna work or I'm lost.\n\n1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.520\n And those are the most fun positions to play usually.\n\n1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:15.920\n But in tournaments, if you're doing a sacrifice,\n\n1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:18.640\n you're playing it with 100% confidence\n\n1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:20.580\n because you're taking the time to calculate it.\n\n1:05:20.580 --> 1:05:22.200\n But yeah, when you have three minutes,\n\n1:05:22.200 --> 1:05:23.040\n you don't have time.\n\n1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:25.600\n So you take a whim and you follow your intuition\n\n1:05:25.600 --> 1:05:27.040\n and you find out later.\n\n1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:29.380\n Or you're very confident it'll work\n\n1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:31.540\n and you haven't calculated all the way until the end,\n\n1:05:31.540 --> 1:05:34.400\n but you've calculated to the point where you have enough\n\n1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:35.640\n in exchange for the sack\n\n1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:37.880\n and you think you could play that position.\n\n1:05:37.880 --> 1:05:41.320\n How do you train chess these days?\n\n1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:44.060\n What's, do you practice?\n\n1:05:44.060 --> 1:05:45.800\n Do you do deliberate practice?\n\n1:05:45.800 --> 1:05:47.360\n I mean, you're in this tough position\n\n1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:50.640\n because you're also a creator and educator and entertainer.\n\n1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:54.680\n So do you try to put in time of like daily practice?\n\n1:05:55.680 --> 1:06:00.360\n I don't train chess anymore when I'm focusing on creating.\n\n1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:02.920\n I do if I'm preparing for a tournament.\n\n1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:04.080\n But back in the day,\n\n1:06:04.080 --> 1:06:07.200\n I would train very seriously for tournaments.\n\n1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:10.880\n And the way it would work is I do opening preparation\n\n1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.040\n for a specific tournament\n\n1:06:12.040 --> 1:06:13.840\n because that's when you really need to have\n\n1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:15.480\n those lines memorized\n\n1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:17.760\n and you could also prepare for specific opponents.\n\n1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:20.840\n And I would do tactics to make sure I stay sharp.\n\n1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:23.120\n So those were the two things I would do every single day\n\n1:06:23.120 --> 1:06:25.120\n for a tournament and then mix up the rest\n\n1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:26.420\n with like maybe some end games,\n\n1:06:26.420 --> 1:06:28.080\n maybe some positional chess.\n\n1:06:28.080 --> 1:06:30.680\n So what does tactics preparation looks like?\n\n1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:34.880\n Do you do like a puzzle, like a random puzzle thing?\n\n1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:36.760\n Yeah, I would just train puzzles\n\n1:06:36.760 --> 1:06:39.760\n for at least like 30 to 60 minutes or books.\n\n1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:41.020\n And sometimes you were,\n\n1:06:41.020 --> 1:06:42.760\n and there's different kinds of puzzles.\n\n1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.780\n One you could train for pattern recognition\n\n1:06:44.780 --> 1:06:46.880\n where you're supposed to go through them very quickly.\n\n1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.680\n And that's just so that when you're playing the game,\n\n1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:49.740\n if your mind is tired,\n\n1:06:49.740 --> 1:06:51.920\n it's still keeping track of things\n\n1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:53.440\n a little bit more easily.\n\n1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:56.160\n And then there's where you're practicing your combination\n\n1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:58.420\n and those sometimes take like 20 minutes to find\n\n1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:00.480\n because you have to just calculate a lot.\n\n1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:01.720\n And it's more like making sure\n\n1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:03.020\n that you've trained with that muscle.\n\n1:07:03.020 --> 1:07:06.360\n But Andrea is actually very good at finding ways\n\n1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:09.320\n to balance and still study while also doing content.\n\n1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:11.680\n Yeah, so what, you're able to do both?\n\n1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:12.680\n That's the hard thing.\n\n1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:14.760\n I was getting very irritated with content\n\n1:07:14.760 --> 1:07:16.280\n because I'm very competitive.\n\n1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:18.560\n I don't like playing chess if I'm losing.\n\n1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:20.260\n And if you're talking and entertaining,\n\n1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:22.560\n you're gonna be losing more games than winning.\n\n1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:24.800\n So then I started doing more training streams\n\n1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:27.040\n where I'd bring on my coach.\n\n1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:28.940\n And one of the things that I wanted to add\n\n1:07:28.940 --> 1:07:30.600\n to Alex's training repertoire.\n\n1:07:30.600 --> 1:07:34.760\n So I would do daily puzzles every time I'm streaming,\n\n1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.600\n which helped me a lot, even if it's like,\n\n1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:40.460\n there's this thing on chess.com called Puzzle Rush,\n\n1:07:40.460 --> 1:07:41.500\n where you have three minutes\n\n1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.400\n and you just do puzzle after puzzle\n\n1:07:43.400 --> 1:07:45.540\n where they get incrementally harder.\n\n1:07:45.540 --> 1:07:46.960\n And it's just a really good way\n\n1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.360\n to build your pattern recognition,\n\n1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.780\n especially when you're rusty.\n\n1:07:49.780 --> 1:07:51.520\n So I would do that till I hit a high score\n\n1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:52.860\n and I wouldn't play any blitz\n\n1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:55.000\n until I hit the score that I want.\n\n1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:59.000\n But that's kind of more like the fun part of chess studying.\n\n1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:02.840\n The very important one is actually analyzing your losses\n\n1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:04.480\n in your tournament games.\n\n1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:07.560\n And first you sit and you look through your mistake yourself\n\n1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.120\n and try to see if you can find the better moves.\n\n1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.440\n And then that's when you would check over with a computer\n\n1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:13.920\n to see if you're right.\n\n1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:16.800\n So game analysis is also very important, which I try to do.\n\n1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:18.160\n I remember to give a shout out,\n\n1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:19.680\n I listened to a couple of episodes\n\n1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:24.040\n of the Perpetual Chess Podcast, which is pretty good.\n\n1:08:24.040 --> 1:08:27.080\n But whatever I listened to, I remember the,\n\n1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:32.080\n it's, I think they really focus on like teaching people.\n\n1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:35.080\n How to train.\n\n1:08:35.080 --> 1:08:37.440\n Yeah, how to play, how to train, all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:08:37.440 --> 1:08:41.640\n They do like, yeah, I'm looking now, adult improver.\n\n1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:46.640\n So basically like how do regular noobs get better at chess?\n\n1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:50.060\n One of the things that, one of the person that said,\n\n1:08:50.060 --> 1:08:52.880\n I think he was the grandmaster, but he said,\n\n1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:56.180\n to maximize the amount of time you spend every day of like,\n\n1:08:56.180 --> 1:08:58.280\n basically as you were saying, like suffering.\n\n1:08:58.280 --> 1:09:01.320\n So like you, it's not about the,\n\n1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:02.960\n like you should be thinking.\n\n1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.640\n You should be doing calculating.\n\n1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.240\n So it's the opposite of what Magnus said.\n\n1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.560\n Like you should be doing a lot of time.\n\n1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:10.180\n It doesn't matter what the puzzle is\n\n1:09:10.180 --> 1:09:11.680\n or whatever the hell you're doing,\n\n1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:14.680\n but you should be like doing that difficult calculation.\n\n1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:15.680\n That's how you get better.\n\n1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:17.440\n Yeah, it really depends what you're training.\n\n1:09:17.440 --> 1:09:18.780\n Cause I used to think the same,\n\n1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:20.340\n but it depends what you're weaker at.\n\n1:09:20.340 --> 1:09:22.040\n Cause if you're doing the really difficult puzzles,\n\n1:09:22.040 --> 1:09:24.280\n you're training for like visualization\n\n1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:27.400\n and calculating more moves ahead than you typically would,\n\n1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:30.080\n which maybe you wouldn't get into that as often\n\n1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:32.640\n in a regular game because typically you run into like\n\n1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:35.800\n three to four tactics, which are actually the easier\n\n1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:37.680\n and more fun ones to solve.\n\n1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:39.240\n So it really depends.\n\n1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:41.560\n And on top of that, as a hobbyist,\n\n1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:43.680\n your motivation is very different\n\n1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:45.520\n than when you're playing from a young age\n\n1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.860\n and have pretty high competitive ambition.\n\n1:09:48.860 --> 1:09:52.300\n And a lot of people who are new to chess,\n\n1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:55.560\n you could basically work on anything and still improve.\n\n1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.320\n So if you're focusing on something you like,\n\n1:09:58.320 --> 1:09:59.880\n you're probably gonna stick to it more\n\n1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:01.040\n and be more consistent,\n\n1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.480\n which I think is more helpful longterm.\n\n1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:08.320\n What was the most embarrassing loss of your career?\n\n1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:09.840\n I had so many flashbacks,\n\n1:10:09.840 --> 1:10:12.400\n but I'm so glad it's a question for Andrea.\n\n1:10:12.400 --> 1:10:14.360\n I like that you specified.\n\n1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:15.320\n You know, it's funny.\n\n1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:16.160\n Cause.\n\n1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:19.800\n I mean, because you said you're so competitive and like.\n\n1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:20.640\n Yeah, no, no.\n\n1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:22.560\n I could tell just even from the way you said it,\n\n1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:24.560\n that like you hate losing.\n\n1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:27.560\n Yeah, I mean, that was the reason I hated chess\n\n1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:29.880\n in high school, cause it'd always be like,\n\n1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.480\n but okay, there's many traumatizing losses\n\n1:10:32.480 --> 1:10:34.880\n where it's like your top three, you're running for first.\n\n1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:36.680\n And then you throw a game you shouldn't,\n\n1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:40.300\n and this shouldn't hurt my ego as much as it does,\n\n1:10:40.300 --> 1:10:42.280\n but it's always kids.\n\n1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:44.000\n Or when I was a high school girl,\n\n1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.520\n it's the younger boys who are really cocky.\n\n1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:48.720\n And when they win, they start rubbing it in your face\n\n1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.460\n and they're yawning and looking around\n\n1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:53.560\n when like 90% of the game you were destroying them\n\n1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.060\n and you had this one tiny mistake\n\n1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:57.000\n and now their ego's huge.\n\n1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.920\n But I'll never forget I was playing like\n\n1:10:58.920 --> 1:11:01.400\n for a chess scholarship.\n\n1:11:01.400 --> 1:11:04.300\n And it was tiebreaker for first,\n\n1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.160\n and I think I lost to a 12 year old girl\n\n1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.160\n who couldn't even use the scholarship,\n\n1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:09.640\n but she beat me in one first place\n\n1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:11.480\n and she got some other prize.\n\n1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:13.960\n So yeah, I was losing to that little girl\n\n1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:17.480\n who's literally like 2300 now, so makes sense.\n\n1:11:17.480 --> 1:11:18.840\n Right, you keep telling yourself that.\n\n1:11:18.840 --> 1:11:22.360\n What do you think, do you think Gasparro was feeling that\n\n1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:24.560\n when he was playing 13 year old Magnus?\n\n1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:26.080\n Like why?\n\n1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:28.680\n As much as it's a beauty of the sport\n\n1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:33.080\n that any age can be brilliant, any demographic, anything,\n\n1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:34.440\n I feel like when you're adults\n\n1:11:34.440 --> 1:11:36.280\n and you're paired against the kid,\n\n1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:38.760\n it's just hard not to let it get to you.\n\n1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:40.880\n And it depends, maybe if they're a really sweet kid,\n\n1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:42.800\n but most of the times I play kids,\n\n1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:43.920\n they're just really arrogant.\n\n1:11:43.920 --> 1:11:45.800\n And I don't think they do it intentionally\n\n1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:46.640\n because they're kids.\n\n1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:48.240\n I mean, there is a certain etiquette thing\n\n1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:51.160\n where like you said, yawning, and in general,\n\n1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:52.000\n like it's not.\n\n1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.520\n If they're kids, there's no etiquette.\n\n1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:54.360\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:55.800\n They don't care.\n\n1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:57.520\n Yeah, the kids traumatized me too.\n\n1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:01.560\n I was playing in Vegas and it was not even my opponent.\n\n1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:03.360\n It was the board next to me.\n\n1:12:03.360 --> 1:12:07.320\n And the kid was at least 10 years old, 12 max,\n\n1:12:07.320 --> 1:12:08.560\n and he was playing against an adult\n\n1:12:08.560 --> 1:12:12.160\n and he takes out his hand and he starts doing a fake phone\n\n1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:15.360\n to which the kid sitting across diagonally\n\n1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:18.560\n picks up their banana and starts talking like it's a phone\n\n1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:19.880\n and they're just mouthing words\n\n1:12:19.880 --> 1:12:21.640\n while their two adult opponents\n\n1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:23.360\n are thinking intensely at the game.\n\n1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:26.640\n And then I see the adult look up, look at the kid,\n\n1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:29.440\n just making banana phone and the despair in his eyes\n\n1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:31.080\n as he sighs.\n\n1:12:31.080 --> 1:12:31.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:33.280\n And they're not even doing it for trash talk.\n\n1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:34.120\n No, no, no.\n\n1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:34.960\n They're just bored.\n\n1:12:34.960 --> 1:12:35.800\n They're just bored kids.\n\n1:12:35.800 --> 1:12:36.920\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:37.760\n What was the,\n\n1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:41.360\n cause you play a bunch of people for your channel.\n\n1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.480\n What was the most like memorable?\n\n1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:46.080\n What's the most fun, most intense?\n\n1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:47.080\n There's a bunch of fun ones.\n\n1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:50.680\n You've played kids before, some trash talking kids.\n\n1:12:50.680 --> 1:12:52.160\n That sounds great.\n\n1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.760\n They trash talk kids.\n\n1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:54.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:56.720\n Nothing like losing a 12 year old\n\n1:12:56.720 --> 1:12:59.080\n who then starts doing a Fortnite dance.\n\n1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:00.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.560\n So that actually happened?\n\n1:13:01.560 --> 1:13:02.720\n That did happen.\n\n1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:05.600\n He is a very young master.\n\n1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:06.600\n I think he became master\n\n1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:08.320\n when he was like nine years old or something.\n\n1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:11.520\n And he's very good at chess and doing a lot of training,\n\n1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:13.720\n but he's also incredibly good at trash talking.\n\n1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:15.760\n And he beat me one game and he stood up\n\n1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.760\n and he started doing the Fortnite dance.\n\n1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.400\n So you gotta just swallow your pride in those moments.\n\n1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:25.320\n What is that culture of like street chess players?\n\n1:13:25.320 --> 1:13:27.720\n It seems pretty interesting.\n\n1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:29.440\n Like, I don't know,\n\n1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:31.640\n that seems to be celebrating the beauty of the game.\n\n1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.360\n It's the trash talking, but also having fun with it,\n\n1:13:34.360 --> 1:13:36.280\n but also taking it seriously.\n\n1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:37.960\n And you've done a few of those.\n\n1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.600\n Did you go to New York?\n\n1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:42.280\n Yeah, in Union Square Park in Washington Square.\n\n1:13:42.280 --> 1:13:43.920\n What was that like?\n\n1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:46.000\n It's such a unique place.\n\n1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.760\n I haven't seen it anywhere else in the US\n\n1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:52.680\n where people are just professional chess hustlers,\n\n1:13:52.680 --> 1:13:55.800\n even if they're not necessarily a top player,\n\n1:13:55.800 --> 1:13:58.120\n but they play chess every single day.\n\n1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:01.240\n And so many of them learn chess by themselves\n\n1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:03.160\n and never had a professional coach.\n\n1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:05.000\n So they are quite good at it.\n\n1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.760\n They're also very tight knit.\n\n1:14:06.760 --> 1:14:07.840\n They all know each other.\n\n1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.360\n And it's a very social thing\n\n1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:11.280\n where you're not just playing chess.\n\n1:14:11.280 --> 1:14:13.520\n It's the experience of getting to know this person\n\n1:14:13.520 --> 1:14:16.400\n who's very much a personality and they talk to you.\n\n1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:18.080\n They could either give you tips\n\n1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:20.320\n or they could be really chatty and talk to you during.\n\n1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:24.040\n So it's a chess experience rather than just playing a game.\n\n1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:26.160\n Do you tell them like what your rating is\n\n1:14:26.160 --> 1:14:29.720\n or do you just let people, like both ways,\n\n1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.960\n do you discover how good the person actually is?\n\n1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:35.600\n Initially, I loved going and not telling people my rating\n\n1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:39.040\n and just surprising them and winning games.\n\n1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:41.720\n But now we've gone so many times that they just know us.\n\n1:14:41.720 --> 1:14:43.400\n So we can't get away with it anymore.\n\n1:14:43.400 --> 1:14:46.120\n One time, actually, I don't know if I should share this,\n\n1:14:46.120 --> 1:14:49.160\n but one time we dressed up as grandmothers\n\n1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:51.640\n and we had prosthetics on our face.\n\n1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:54.240\n And I think they still recognized us.\n\n1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:56.720\n Yeah, it's probably the, there's other components,\n\n1:14:56.720 --> 1:14:58.600\n like probably the trash talk and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:00.200\n Actually, no, it was funny.\n\n1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:01.560\n We were talking like grandmothers,\n\n1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:04.320\n but it was the way I held, it was the way I held them.\n\n1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:06.800\n Grandmother talk like, back of my day.\n\n1:15:06.800 --> 1:15:10.440\n No, no, no, no, no, no, we're not bringing this back.\n\n1:15:10.440 --> 1:15:11.960\n We're not bringing this back.\n\n1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:14.040\n Okay, what were your names, what were the code names?\n\n1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:14.880\n Oh my God.\n\n1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:19.000\n I think it was Edna, Edna, and I had a really,\n\n1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:20.480\n I can't remember the other one.\n\n1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:23.400\n But it was embarrassing because we were walking so slowly\n\n1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:25.640\n and Andrea dropped her cane or something at one point\n\n1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:27.840\n and then people in the park came to help her.\n\n1:15:27.840 --> 1:15:29.680\n We felt so embarrassed.\n\n1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:31.920\n But yeah, it was funny.\n\n1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:33.240\n Cause they didn't know it was us\n\n1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.640\n until he saw the way I reached for my pawn.\n\n1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:38.520\n And he said, the way you held your pawn, I knew it was you.\n\n1:15:38.520 --> 1:15:40.760\n It was like such a niche thing.\n\n1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:42.560\n That was what blew the grandma cover.\n\n1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:47.080\n Yeah, do you have a style of how you play physically?\n\n1:15:47.080 --> 1:15:47.920\n Is that recognizable?\n\n1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:51.000\n I didn't think we did until grandma went to play chess, but.\n\n1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.080\n Yeah, I've never thought about that.\n\n1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:56.280\n Yeah, I think our style is just trash talking now.\n\n1:15:56.280 --> 1:15:59.360\n Style is very, if you're talking about style\n\n1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:03.760\n on YouTube and Twitch, we definitely have a distinctive style.\n\n1:16:03.760 --> 1:16:04.600\n What's that?\n\n1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:06.960\n What's your distinctive, just talking shit?\n\n1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:07.800\n Yes.\n\n1:16:07.800 --> 1:16:09.240\n But not going too far.\n\n1:16:09.240 --> 1:16:12.200\n No, no, definitely that's, definitely going to.\n\n1:16:12.200 --> 1:16:14.080\n If it's us two against each other.\n\n1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:16.680\n Oh, we trash talk each other so hard.\n\n1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:17.520\n So brutally.\n\n1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:18.760\n And I love looking at Andrea\n\n1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:21.000\n and watching her little nose scrunch up\n\n1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.880\n as she's annoyed and the satisfaction\n\n1:16:22.880 --> 1:16:24.800\n I get when that happens.\n\n1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:26.320\n How many times do you play against each other\n\n1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:28.320\n on online publicly?\n\n1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:29.960\n I think I've seen a couple of games.\n\n1:16:29.960 --> 1:16:31.160\n We played a lot of times.\n\n1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:33.400\n We try not to do it too often cause it's repetitive,\n\n1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:35.880\n but every now and then when we haven't done it for a while,\n\n1:16:35.880 --> 1:16:36.920\n we'll go at it again.\n\n1:16:36.920 --> 1:16:37.760\n What do you mean repetitive?\n\n1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:40.320\n Is that implied trash talk right there?\n\n1:16:40.320 --> 1:16:42.800\n No, it just, we play similar openings.\n\n1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:44.120\n So you just start seeing the same position too often.\n\n1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:46.720\n It's the same opening against each other every time.\n\n1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:48.240\n Andrea's really good at opening.\n\n1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:50.080\n So I just start playing bad openings\n\n1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:51.880\n to get her out of her preparation.\n\n1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.680\n Cause I don't like opening theory very much.\n\n1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:54.920\n I just like playing the game\n\n1:16:54.920 --> 1:16:57.360\n and getting into middle games and end games.\n\n1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:59.600\n But yeah, typically the only time we're playing each other\n\n1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:01.040\n is when we're setting up in the park\n\n1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:04.000\n and we don't have opponents yet and we need content.\n\n1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:05.960\n So we just play each other until people show up.\n\n1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:07.760\n But we always put stakes on the line,\n\n1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:09.240\n which makes it very interesting.\n\n1:17:09.240 --> 1:17:11.000\n Cause otherwise it wouldn't be fun to play each other\n\n1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:11.840\n if there's no stakes.\n\n1:17:11.840 --> 1:17:14.360\n Where's the most fun place you've played?\n\n1:17:14.360 --> 1:17:15.440\n Is it New York?\n\n1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:16.280\n I think so.\n\n1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:19.720\n And it was actually when we set up in Times Square one night,\n\n1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:22.720\n we just brought a table with us and chess.\n\n1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:25.280\n And it's not even where people usually play chess,\n\n1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.680\n but it was so lively.\n\n1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.000\n There were all of the lights out\n\n1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.600\n and so many people just kept stopping by to play chess.\n\n1:17:31.600 --> 1:17:33.760\n And it was really one of my favorite streams.\n\n1:17:33.760 --> 1:17:36.800\n It's just the opposite of like the classical chess world.\n\n1:17:36.800 --> 1:17:37.720\n It's super loud.\n\n1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:39.040\n There's music, there's cars,\n\n1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:40.200\n there's street dancers,\n\n1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:42.360\n even some naked people walking around\n\n1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:44.480\n who we had to be careful not to get banned.\n\n1:17:44.480 --> 1:17:47.160\n But I honestly really liked the chaotic environments\n\n1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:48.360\n for chess games.\n\n1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:49.280\n Cause I think it's a good way\n\n1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:51.040\n to break more into the mainstream culture\n\n1:17:51.040 --> 1:17:52.680\n and make it entertaining and appealing\n\n1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:55.320\n to anyone who doesn't know anything about chess.\n\n1:17:55.320 --> 1:17:56.160\n So that's the way.\n\n1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.600\n And also in an authentic way,\n\n1:17:57.600 --> 1:17:59.960\n because it's what we really like about chess\n\n1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:01.480\n when you're just enjoying the game,\n\n1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:03.240\n but also the atmosphere\n\n1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:05.360\n and the people who you're playing with.\n\n1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:07.800\n And that's one of the things that I think you see less\n\n1:18:07.800 --> 1:18:10.840\n when you're just thinking of chess as a competitive thing.\n\n1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:14.440\n You've mentioned a few other games,\n\n1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:16.160\n like the Bobby Fischer games,\n\n1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:17.200\n the Candidates match,\n\n1:18:17.200 --> 1:18:19.240\n the game of the century,\n\n1:18:19.240 --> 1:18:21.280\n which I feel like is a weird game\n\n1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.440\n to call the game of the century\n\n1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.880\n when there's still like a few decades left in the century.\n\n1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:25.720\n But yeah.\n\n1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:27.040\n I mean, it wasn't an official thing.\n\n1:18:27.040 --> 1:18:28.560\n It was just the chess journalist.\n\n1:18:28.560 --> 1:18:29.960\n It's just like made on a chess article.\n\n1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:31.320\n But it's stuck if you look on.\n\n1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:32.160\n Yeah, no, it did stick.\n\n1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:33.000\n Again, Wikipedia.\n\n1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.720\n This is all I do research wise.\n\n1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:36.960\n Because there's,\n\n1:18:36.960 --> 1:18:41.560\n so that particular one was a 13 year old Fischer\n\n1:18:41.560 --> 1:18:44.000\n and he did a queen sacrifice.\n\n1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:47.280\n I wonder, there's that movie searching for Bobby Fischer.\n\n1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:48.280\n Was that related?\n\n1:18:48.280 --> 1:18:51.000\n Cause didn't they have a young somebody\n\n1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.720\n who's supposed to be kind of like Bobby Fischer\n\n1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:54.520\n played by Josh Waitzkin.\n\n1:18:54.520 --> 1:18:57.520\n Yeah, I think he ended up being an international master.\n\n1:18:57.520 --> 1:18:59.080\n It wasn't based on Bobby Fischer.\n\n1:18:59.080 --> 1:19:00.280\n It was based on another player,\n\n1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.600\n but I liked how they told it through the lens\n\n1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:04.800\n of being inspired by Bobby Fischer.\n\n1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:05.920\n Do you remember that game?\n\n1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:08.200\n Like why do you think it was dubbed the game of the century?\n\n1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.360\n It was just journalists being like.\n\n1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:12.720\n I think part of it was the atmosphere\n\n1:19:12.720 --> 1:19:15.080\n where you have the US junior champion\n\n1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:17.240\n who's this 13 year old nobody.\n\n1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.480\n And it's the first time he's playing\n\n1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:21.240\n in a very competitive landscape\n\n1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.840\n against some of the top American players.\n\n1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:26.840\n And he goes up against an international master.\n\n1:19:26.840 --> 1:19:29.600\n So somebody who's a lot stronger than he is\n\n1:19:29.600 --> 1:19:32.840\n who's played in Olympiads for the American team.\n\n1:19:32.840 --> 1:19:34.560\n He's having a bad tournament,\n\n1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:36.240\n but then he has this one game\n\n1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:40.000\n where he just shows off his tactical prowess\n\n1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.640\n and plays incredibly well.\n\n1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:43.440\n And I don't know if this is true,\n\n1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:44.960\n but in the paper clippings of it,\n\n1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:47.200\n they'd say things like grandmasters were by the board\n\n1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:48.720\n and they would say things like,\n\n1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:51.080\n oh, Bobby is lost in this position.\n\n1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:51.920\n What is he doing?\n\n1:19:51.920 --> 1:19:53.200\n But there's this 13 year old kid\n\n1:19:53.200 --> 1:19:55.120\n who's just playing incredibly well.\n\n1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.440\n And then that also happened\n\n1:19:56.440 --> 1:20:01.160\n before Bobby's started really rapidly improving at chess.\n\n1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:02.200\n Not that people knew that,\n\n1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:03.920\n but he kind of seemed like a rising star.\n\n1:20:03.920 --> 1:20:05.320\n So I think the game was beautiful,\n\n1:20:05.320 --> 1:20:08.480\n but I also think the idea of a 13 year old kid\n\n1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:09.560\n coming out from nowhere\n\n1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:12.480\n and beating a top American player was very fascinating.\n\n1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:13.720\n And there was aggressive chess\n\n1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:15.920\n and it was interesting ideas.\n\n1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:18.120\n Yeah, taking big risks.\n\n1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:20.120\n It's cool to see a 13 year old do that.\n\n1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:22.600\n What about the,\n\n1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:27.320\n you mentioned that his match against Mark Taimano\n\n1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:29.440\n from their 71 candidates match\n\n1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:31.000\n was interesting in some way.\n\n1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:32.520\n Why is it interesting to you?\n\n1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:36.880\n Move 45, I'm looking at some notes.\n\n1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:38.840\n This is with the Bishop E3.\n\n1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:41.120\n I think I know which one you're talking about.\n\n1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:43.720\n It's, I wouldn't say,\n\n1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:45.600\n a lot of these games on these lists\n\n1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:48.040\n I think are really great combinations\n\n1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.760\n that when tactics come into play,\n\n1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:52.320\n which is what we're talking about.\n\n1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:56.000\n But they're very good at exemplifying lessons.\n\n1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.280\n This is why you study famous games.\n\n1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:00.880\n So you can apply these lessons to your own games.\n\n1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:02.760\n And I think the main takeaway for this one\n\n1:21:02.760 --> 1:21:04.800\n was they're punishing their opponent\n\n1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:07.560\n from steering away from opening principles,\n\n1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:11.200\n which is something that we learned a little earlier\n\n1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:14.120\n where he delayed the development of his King\n\n1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:17.160\n and put his Queen out a little bit too exposed.\n\n1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:19.920\n So Bobby Fisher immediately punished that.\n\n1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:22.320\n And then there was just like a beautiful combination\n\n1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:25.840\n where it was like a 12 in a row perfect moves,\n\n1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:27.720\n which was a tactic, just winning the game.\n\n1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:30.400\n But it only came from punishing those mistakes.\n\n1:21:30.400 --> 1:21:32.400\n The mistake being bringing the Queen out?\n\n1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:33.240\n Bringing the Queen out\n\n1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:35.960\n and yeah, not castling your King right away.\n\n1:21:35.960 --> 1:21:37.920\n And these were just like opening principles\n\n1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:39.320\n that now they're written in books,\n\n1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:42.360\n but for books you would study these principles\n\n1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:43.480\n by studying games.\n\n1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:48.160\n And also, I'm looking at some notes,\n\n1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:50.120\n his dominance during the candidate's turn\n\n1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:52.200\n was unprecedented.\n\n1:21:52.200 --> 1:21:54.600\n He swept two top grandmasters.\n\n1:21:54.600 --> 1:21:57.680\n I mean, that guy's meteoric rise is incredible.\n\n1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:01.440\n Sad that I think at whatever in his 20s,\n\n1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:03.320\n he then quit chess.\n\n1:22:03.320 --> 1:22:07.200\n One has to wonder where he could have gone.\n\n1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:11.200\n Yeah, it is sad that we lost such a brilliant mind\n\n1:22:11.200 --> 1:22:12.040\n so early on.\n\n1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:15.160\n And it's also sad, I think kind of what ended up happening\n\n1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:18.120\n in his life and the slowly going crazier.\n\n1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:19.520\n Is there some aspect of chess\n\n1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:23.200\n that opens the door to crazy?\n\n1:22:23.200 --> 1:22:26.640\n Like how challenging it is on you,\n\n1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:30.600\n the stress, the anxiety of it, the isolation.\n\n1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:31.760\n And being alone.\n\n1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:32.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:33.720\n It's a very lonely sport.\n\n1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:36.760\n It is, even do you guys, since you both play it,\n\n1:22:36.760 --> 1:22:38.880\n it's still lonely, the experience of it?\n\n1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:40.960\n It was when I was competing a lot.\n\n1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:43.440\n I think the crazy part of it for me\n\n1:22:43.440 --> 1:22:47.400\n was how obsessed you can get about a board game\n\n1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:50.040\n where you're optimizing your entire life\n\n1:22:50.040 --> 1:22:53.080\n to beat another person at pushing wooden pieces\n\n1:22:53.080 --> 1:22:53.920\n across the board.\n\n1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:57.040\n And it doesn't necessarily translate to other things.\n\n1:22:57.040 --> 1:22:59.760\n And the fact that so many people spend so much\n\n1:22:59.760 --> 1:23:01.040\n of their life on it,\n\n1:23:01.040 --> 1:23:02.880\n but you can also spend so much of your life\n\n1:23:02.880 --> 1:23:05.600\n because it's so deep and so interesting.\n\n1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:09.600\n And I mean, I've definitely experienced moments\n\n1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:13.440\n where I didn't want to do anything but chess.\n\n1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:16.200\n And I had that before I went to college\n\n1:23:16.200 --> 1:23:18.600\n where I just wanted to take a gap year and focus on chess\n\n1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:21.720\n because I went to high school, we moved a lot,\n\n1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:23.120\n there was always other things going on.\n\n1:23:23.120 --> 1:23:26.680\n So I felt like I could never really focus on chess.\n\n1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.600\n And the one time I could, by taking a gap year,\n\n1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:32.000\n I ended up not doing because my parents really wanted me\n\n1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.720\n to go to university right away.\n\n1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:35.960\n But I think maybe if I had taken that gap year,\n\n1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:37.600\n I don't know if I would have gone back to school.\n\n1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:39.200\n So maybe it wasn't a bad thing.\n\n1:23:39.200 --> 1:23:40.760\n I'd also say that's pretty universal.\n\n1:23:40.760 --> 1:23:43.120\n I think if you want to be the best at anything you do\n\n1:23:43.120 --> 1:23:45.320\n or any sport, you have to be that level of obsessed.\n\n1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:47.680\n So I don't know if that's only chess.\n\n1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:50.840\n Well, some things, some obsessions are more transferable\n\n1:23:50.840 --> 1:23:53.720\n to a balanced social life.\n\n1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:54.560\n That is true.\n\n1:23:54.560 --> 1:23:55.400\n Like healthy development.\n\n1:23:55.400 --> 1:23:58.520\n Yeah, chess is a lot less social than most other sports.\n\n1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:01.960\n Yeah, there's something deeply isolating about this game.\n\n1:24:01.960 --> 1:24:03.640\n I mean, the great chess players I've met,\n\n1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:07.880\n I mean, it's really competitive too.\n\n1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:12.880\n And there's something that you're almost nonstop paranoid\n\n1:24:15.800 --> 1:24:18.840\n about blundering at every level.\n\n1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:21.440\n And that develops a person who is really anxious\n\n1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:26.240\n about losing versus someone who deeply enjoys perfection\n\n1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:27.760\n or winning and so on.\n\n1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:30.200\n It's just this constant paranoia about losing.\n\n1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:35.200\n Maybe I'm misinterpreting it, but that creates huge amount\n\n1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:38.360\n of stress over like thousands of games,\n\n1:24:38.360 --> 1:24:41.000\n especially in a young person.\n\n1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:44.720\n And that blundering is such a painful experience\n\n1:24:44.720 --> 1:24:47.520\n because you could be playing a game that you've played\n\n1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:52.040\n for five, six hours and you have one lapse in focus\n\n1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:54.600\n and you blunder and you throw the entire game away.\n\n1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:56.280\n And sometimes not just the entire game,\n\n1:24:56.280 --> 1:24:57.280\n but the entire tournament.\n\n1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:59.520\n Now you can't place or do anything anymore.\n\n1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:02.920\n So you just feel those mistakes so strongly.\n\n1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:06.320\n Yeah, there's no one to blame but yourself.\n\n1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:08.120\n Are you guys hard on yourself?\n\n1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:10.600\n Have you been about losing?\n\n1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:13.800\n Like before you became super famous for streaming\n\n1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:15.240\n where you could be like, well, fuck this,\n\n1:25:15.240 --> 1:25:17.120\n at least I can have fun playing.\n\n1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:20.480\n So I was really hard on myself and I went to play\n\n1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:22.440\n a tournament in Canada to try to qualify\n\n1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:24.600\n for the Olympiad team.\n\n1:25:24.600 --> 1:25:28.040\n And I was like, well, I'm an adult now.\n\n1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:30.880\n I'm not gonna feel emotional if I lose.\n\n1:25:30.880 --> 1:25:33.440\n And then I got there on the first day.\n\n1:25:33.440 --> 1:25:37.440\n I think I was ranked like fourth in Canada for females.\n\n1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:40.040\n How long ago was this?\n\n1:25:40.040 --> 1:25:43.440\n This was like earlier in the year actually.\n\n1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:46.440\n And I go and I lose to somebody lower rated\n\n1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:47.840\n on the first day.\n\n1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:49.800\n And I think it was because I blundered\n\n1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.560\n and I went back to my room and I was like,\n\n1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:52.680\n I am not an adult.\n\n1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:54.720\n I'm not eating, I'm not leaving this room.\n\n1:25:54.720 --> 1:25:56.800\n I feel terrible and I know I shouldn't,\n\n1:25:56.800 --> 1:25:59.640\n but it just cuts so deep.\n\n1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:02.280\n And then I actually ended up qualifying\n\n1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:04.760\n for the Olympiad team, but I didn't wanna play\n\n1:26:04.760 --> 1:26:06.400\n because I didn't have enough time to train\n\n1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:08.480\n and the losses are so painful that I was like,\n\n1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:09.960\n it's not worth it.\n\n1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:12.560\n Yeah, in high school and growing up,\n\n1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:14.280\n I just remember weekends.\n\n1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:16.680\n And I think being competitive in any sport,\n\n1:26:16.680 --> 1:26:18.200\n again, probably people relate to this,\n\n1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:20.040\n which is like spending weekends crying.\n\n1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:22.120\n And even like Alex said, like punishing yourself\n\n1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:23.920\n because you're disappointed in yourself\n\n1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:25.400\n because you fight so hard and you prepare\n\n1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:29.280\n and you study and you're like, oh, yeah.\n\n1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:32.840\n But that's once again on the bright side though,\n\n1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:37.120\n when you're studying so hard and after like a four hour game\n\n1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:40.160\n and you actually are on the opposite end and you win,\n\n1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:43.720\n you feel like such a huge rush of dopamine and serotonin\n\n1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:45.320\n and you're like on a high from the wind.\n\n1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:47.680\n So there's also plus sides or you can turn this around.\n\n1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:50.380\n But yeah, like Alex said, like losing\n\n1:26:50.380 --> 1:26:53.000\n after preparing for something and fighting on hours\n\n1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.760\n and hours is the worst feeling in the world.\n\n1:26:54.760 --> 1:26:58.200\n Did you ever get anything like that with martial arts?\n\n1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.000\n Yeah, so, you know, wrestling,\n\n1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.360\n I wrestled all through high school and middle school.\n\n1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:03.760\n Definitely, so it's an individual sport.\n\n1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:05.720\n I did a lot of individual sport, tennis,\n\n1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:07.160\n those kinds of things.\n\n1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:09.680\n But I think even with wrestling and tennis,\n\n1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:11.480\n you're still on a team.\n\n1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:14.800\n You can still like, there's still a comradery there.\n\n1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:16.960\n I feel like with chess, especially you go on your own\n\n1:27:16.960 --> 1:27:20.760\n with the tournaments, like you really are alone.\n\n1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:23.160\n But I mean, I always personally just had\n\n1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:25.360\n like a very self critical mind in general.\n\n1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:26.200\n I would not.\n\n1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:29.560\n It's one of the reasons I decided not to play chess\n\n1:27:29.560 --> 1:27:32.480\n because I think when I was really young,\n\n1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:37.480\n I met somebody who was able to play blindfold chess.\n\n1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:39.600\n They were teaching me, they were laying in there\n\n1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:42.580\n on the couch, trashed, drinking and smoking.\n\n1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:43.420\n And there were.\n\n1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:44.240\n Sounds like a Russian.\n\n1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:45.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:48.880\n There are now a faculty somewhere in the United States.\n\n1:27:48.880 --> 1:27:49.880\n I forget where.\n\n1:27:49.880 --> 1:27:54.040\n But he making jokes, talking to others\n\n1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:56.600\n and he would move the pieces, like he would yell\n\n1:27:56.600 --> 1:27:57.500\n across the room.\n\n1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:03.480\n And I remember thinking that if a person is able to do that,\n\n1:28:04.060 --> 1:28:08.040\n then that kind of world you can live in inside your mind\n\n1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:09.280\n that becomes the chessboard.\n\n1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:12.520\n To me, that meant like the chessboard is not just out here.\n\n1:28:12.520 --> 1:28:14.960\n It could be in here and you could do these beautiful,\n\n1:28:14.960 --> 1:28:17.840\n you can create these beautiful patterns in your mind.\n\n1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:22.800\n I thought like, I had such a strong pull towards that\n\n1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:26.520\n where I had to decide either I'm gonna dedicate everything\n\n1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:28.400\n to this or not.\n\n1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:30.760\n You can't do half assed.\n\n1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:35.000\n And then that's when I decided to walk away from it\n\n1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.280\n because I had so much other beautiful things in my life.\n\n1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:38.520\n I loved mathematics.\n\n1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:40.880\n I loved, just everything was beautiful to me.\n\n1:28:40.880 --> 1:28:44.680\n I thought chess would pull me all in.\n\n1:28:44.680 --> 1:28:47.520\n And there was nothing like it, I think,\n\n1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:49.560\n in my whole life since then.\n\n1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:52.360\n I think it's such a dangerous addiction.\n\n1:28:52.360 --> 1:28:54.920\n It's such a beautiful addiction, but it's a dangerous one,\n\n1:28:54.920 --> 1:28:56.320\n depending on what your mind is like.\n\n1:28:56.320 --> 1:28:58.920\n It reminds me of something I thought of\n\n1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:01.360\n before I stopped competing as much.\n\n1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:03.360\n And I'd look at people and think,\n\n1:29:03.360 --> 1:29:06.920\n imagine being so intelligent that you could become\n\n1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.160\n a grandmaster and yet only spending the rest of your life\n\n1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:11.520\n being a grandmaster.\n\n1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:13.840\n Because it's one of those things where it does require\n\n1:29:13.840 --> 1:29:16.640\n a lot of mental power, but by doing chess,\n\n1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:19.720\n you're not gonna be able to explore other subjects deeply.\n\n1:29:20.600 --> 1:29:21.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:24.000\n And not in a way that is bad necessarily,\n\n1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.400\n more an admiration and wondering what else could have been\n\n1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:29.720\n because I've just seen people get to these levels\n\n1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:31.680\n of obsession where it's all they wanna do.\n\n1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:34.120\n And they're grandmasters, but they're not even top players.\n\n1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:36.000\n So they're never gonna make a living out of it.\n\n1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:38.680\n They'll make like maybe 30, 40K a year max.\n\n1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:40.680\n They can't even focus on their competitive chess\n\n1:29:40.680 --> 1:29:44.240\n because they have to supplement it by teaching\n\n1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:45.400\n and doing things they don't like.\n\n1:29:45.400 --> 1:29:48.000\n And it's just because of how strong of an obsession\n\n1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:52.520\n it can be because it truly is very intellectually rewarding.\n\n1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:54.320\n And I think that's what people are addicted to\n\n1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:55.960\n in the self improvement, but you can get that\n\n1:29:55.960 --> 1:29:58.080\n from a lot of other things as well.\n\n1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:00.440\n Well, I think for me, what I was inspired by\n\n1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:03.400\n that stuck with me is that a human being\n\n1:30:03.400 --> 1:30:08.400\n could be so good at one thing.\n\n1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:10.000\n Right.\n\n1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:11.840\n To me, that person on the couch drinking and so on,\n\n1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:14.960\n I assumed he was the best chess player in the world.\n\n1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:18.200\n Like to be able to play inside your head,\n\n1:30:18.200 --> 1:30:22.320\n it just felt like a feat that's incredible.\n\n1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:24.440\n And so I fell in love with the idea\n\n1:30:24.440 --> 1:30:26.160\n that I hope to be something like that\n\n1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:27.720\n in my life at something.\n\n1:30:27.720 --> 1:30:31.320\n It would be pretty cool to be really good at one thing.\n\n1:30:31.320 --> 1:30:34.480\n And like life in some sense is a search for the things\n\n1:30:34.480 --> 1:30:36.960\n that you could be that good at.\n\n1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:38.680\n I didn't even think about like how much money\n\n1:30:38.680 --> 1:30:40.400\n does it make or any of that.\n\n1:30:40.400 --> 1:30:42.560\n It's can I fall in love with something\n\n1:30:42.560 --> 1:30:46.840\n and make it a life pursuit where I can be damn good at it.\n\n1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:50.560\n And being damn good at it is the source of enjoyment.\n\n1:30:50.560 --> 1:30:55.200\n Not like not to win because you want to win a tournament\n\n1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:58.720\n or win because like you just want to be better\n\n1:30:58.720 --> 1:30:59.560\n at somebody else.\n\n1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:01.440\n No, it's for the beauty of the game itself\n\n1:31:01.440 --> 1:31:03.480\n or the beauty of the activity itself.\n\n1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:05.720\n And then you realize that that's one of the compelling\n\n1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:06.560\n things about chess.\n\n1:31:06.560 --> 1:31:10.440\n It is a game with rules and you can win.\n\n1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:12.920\n If you want to be really damn good in some aspect\n\n1:31:12.920 --> 1:31:17.920\n of life like that, it's a harder and weirder pursuit.\n\n1:31:19.280 --> 1:31:20.960\n Don't you feel like you kind of did that\n\n1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:24.120\n with computer science or AI related things?\n\n1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:27.440\n Like getting that level of damn good.\n\n1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:31.720\n That's one of the cool things about AI and robotics\n\n1:31:31.720 --> 1:31:34.080\n or intellectual pursuits or scientific pursuits\n\n1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:36.440\n is you can spend until you're 80 doing it.\n\n1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:37.920\n So I'm in the early days of that.\n\n1:31:37.920 --> 1:31:40.760\n One of the reasons I came to Texas,\n\n1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:43.560\n one of the reasons I didn't want to pursue\n\n1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:48.560\n an academic career at MIT is I want to build a company.\n\n1:31:49.040 --> 1:31:52.760\n And so I'm in the early days of that AI company.\n\n1:31:52.760 --> 1:31:56.680\n And so it's an open world to see if I'm actually\n\n1:31:56.680 --> 1:31:57.640\n going to be good at it.\n\n1:31:57.640 --> 1:32:01.160\n But the thing that's there that I've been cognizant\n\n1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.160\n of my whole life is that I have a passion for it.\n\n1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:06.640\n Something within me draws me to that thing.\n\n1:32:06.640 --> 1:32:09.120\n And you have to listen to that, to that voice.\n\n1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:13.720\n So with chess, you're fucked unless you like early on\n\n1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:16.240\n are really training really hard.\n\n1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:18.040\n I think life is more forgiving.\n\n1:32:19.280 --> 1:32:22.600\n You can be world class at a thing\n\n1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:25.640\n after making a lot of mistakes.\n\n1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:28.960\n And after spending the first few decades of your life\n\n1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:30.640\n doing something completely different.\n\n1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:34.040\n And chess, it's like an Olympic sport.\n\n1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:37.600\n Like there's no, perfection is a requirement,\n\n1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:38.620\n is a necessity.\n\n1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:42.400\n What do you think is that pursuit for you?\n\n1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.440\n Like why did you decide to stream?\n\n1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:46.840\n What drew you?\n\n1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:48.120\n I like these questions.\n\n1:32:48.120 --> 1:32:50.040\n Now we're really getting deep.\n\n1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:51.800\n Yeah, this is like a therapy session.\n\n1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:55.680\n I mean, isn't it terrifying to be in front of a camera?\n\n1:32:55.680 --> 1:32:58.160\n Well, it's terrifying to be in front of five cameras.\n\n1:32:58.160 --> 1:32:59.160\n The set up is.\n\n1:32:59.160 --> 1:33:00.400\n Corrections, six.\n\n1:33:00.400 --> 1:33:01.240\n Six, okay.\n\n1:33:01.240 --> 1:33:04.320\n It's more terrifying for me to try to remember\n\n1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:06.200\n if I actually turned them all.\n\n1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:07.640\n Like I mentioned to you off mic,\n\n1:33:07.640 --> 1:33:09.880\n I'm still suffering from a bit of PTSD\n\n1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:13.560\n after screwing up a recording of Magnus.\n\n1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:19.440\n He had to console me because that was the thing.\n\n1:33:19.440 --> 1:33:23.680\n I felt, okay, you wanna build robots.\n\n1:33:24.720 --> 1:33:28.320\n If you can't get a camera to even run correctly,\n\n1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:30.600\n how are you gonna do anything else in life?\n\n1:33:30.600 --> 1:33:33.040\n Oh no, don't let it spiral like that.\n\n1:33:33.040 --> 1:33:36.240\n It was spiraling hard and I was just laying there\n\n1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:38.640\n and just feeling sorry for myself.\n\n1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:40.760\n But I think that feeling, by the way,\n\n1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:43.160\n and the small tangent, is really useful.\n\n1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:48.240\n I feel like a lot of growing happens when you feel shitty.\n\n1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:50.640\n As long as you can get out of it.\n\n1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:53.000\n Like don't let it spiral indefinitely.\n\n1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.600\n But just feeling really, really shitty\n\n1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:56.760\n about everything in my life.\n\n1:33:56.760 --> 1:33:58.240\n Like I was having an existential crisis.\n\n1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:01.920\n Like how will I be able to do anything at all?\n\n1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:03.520\n Like you're a giant failure,\n\n1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:06.000\n all those kinds of negative voices.\n\n1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.880\n But I think I made some good decisions\n\n1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:10.920\n in the week after that.\n\n1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:11.760\n Of like, okay.\n\n1:34:11.760 --> 1:34:13.160\n Do you think you couldn't have made those decisions\n\n1:34:13.160 --> 1:34:14.960\n if you were less hard on yourself?\n\n1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:18.280\n Me personally, no.\n\n1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:19.600\n I'm too lazy.\n\n1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:23.040\n Okay, so you really need to be angry at yourself enough\n\n1:34:23.040 --> 1:34:24.400\n to go and do what you need.\n\n1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:25.240\n Yeah, it's not even angry,\n\n1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:27.320\n it's just upset of being self critical.\n\n1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:29.640\n Like also for me personally,\n\n1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:33.400\n because I don't have proclivities for depression,\n\n1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:38.600\n I have a lot more room\n\n1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:41.520\n to feel extremely shitty about myself.\n\n1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:45.760\n So if you're somebody that can get stuck in that place,\n\n1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:47.320\n like clinically depressed,\n\n1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:48.880\n you have to be really, really careful.\n\n1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:50.280\n You have to notice the triggers,\n\n1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:51.760\n you don't wanna get into that place.\n\n1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:54.160\n But for me, just looking empirically,\n\n1:34:54.160 --> 1:34:58.200\n feeling shitty has always been productive.\n\n1:34:58.200 --> 1:35:00.920\n Like it makes me long term happier.\n\n1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:04.200\n Ultimately, it makes me more grateful to be alive\n\n1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:06.120\n and it helps me grow, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:10.120\n So I kinda embrace it.\n\n1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:12.680\n Otherwise, I feel like I will never do anything.\n\n1:35:12.680 --> 1:35:13.720\n I have to feel shitty,\n\n1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:16.600\n but that's not a thing I prescribe to others.\n\n1:35:16.600 --> 1:35:19.760\n There's a famous professor at MIT,\n\n1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:22.000\n his name is Marvin Minsky.\n\n1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:25.400\n And when he was giving advice about like to the students,\n\n1:35:26.440 --> 1:35:28.640\n he said, the secret to my success\n\n1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:33.040\n was that I always hated everything I did in the past.\n\n1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:36.080\n So always sort of being self critical\n\n1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:37.080\n about everything you've accomplished,\n\n1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:39.880\n never really take a moment of gratitude.\n\n1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:41.640\n And I think for a lot of people that hear that,\n\n1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:42.600\n that's not good.\n\n1:35:42.600 --> 1:35:45.640\n You should like take a pause and be grateful,\n\n1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:47.360\n but it really worked for him.\n\n1:35:47.360 --> 1:35:50.600\n So it's a choice you have to make.\n\n1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:54.440\n It reminds me of the quote, be happy but never satisfied,\n\n1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:57.600\n where you can have a positive spin\n\n1:35:57.600 --> 1:35:59.600\n and still want to improve yourself.\n\n1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:05.560\n But yeah, like when did you decide\n\n1:36:06.320 --> 1:36:08.200\n to take a step in the spotlight,\n\n1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:11.160\n that terrifying spotlight of the internet?\n\n1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:14.280\n It was actually my senior year of college\n\n1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:17.840\n and I was really busy with work and school\n\n1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:21.000\n and chess was kind of like this lost love.\n\n1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:22.800\n And the interesting thing is that\n\n1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:24.240\n the longer I don't play chess,\n\n1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:26.320\n the more I kind of miss playing it casually\n\n1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:27.360\n and enjoy it more.\n\n1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:30.040\n Cause then I start looking at it with fresh eyes,\n\n1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:32.000\n but I didn't have time to play tournaments.\n\n1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.920\n So I started streaming online because it was more social\n\n1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.320\n than just playing strangers on the internet\n\n1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:41.120\n without knowing anything about who they are.\n\n1:36:41.120 --> 1:36:44.440\n And I started slowly growing a community\n\n1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:47.480\n and got in touch with chess.com pretty quickly too.\n\n1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:50.080\n So then it was this hobby that I would do once a week,\n\n1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:52.400\n every Thursday at 8 p.m.\n\n1:36:52.400 --> 1:36:55.880\n And it was one of the things that brought me a lot of joy.\n\n1:36:55.880 --> 1:36:58.800\n And actually I, speaking of depression,\n\n1:36:58.800 --> 1:37:02.120\n did struggle for it with at least 10 years of my life.\n\n1:37:02.120 --> 1:37:06.080\n And it was one of those things where chess and streaming\n\n1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:09.840\n was such a distraction and it brought me such great joy\n\n1:37:09.840 --> 1:37:13.720\n that I just kept doing it cause I really, really liked it.\n\n1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:18.080\n And then I was working on something that didn't pan out\n\n1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:21.520\n and decided to go and take a risk and just stream full time,\n\n1:37:21.520 --> 1:37:26.520\n which, you know, seemed a little bit weird at the moment.\n\n1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:29.000\n Was that terrifying, that leap?\n\n1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:30.200\n It was terrifying,\n\n1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:33.320\n but I had taken so many terrifying leaps in the past\n\n1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:36.560\n and they didn't, you know, the last two hadn't worked out,\n\n1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:39.440\n but I was like, well, I'll get it eventually.\n\n1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:43.440\n So somehow having failed before and going through failure\n\n1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:45.880\n and knowing that it'll be okay,\n\n1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:48.360\n made me more likely to just try something\n\n1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:50.360\n that was a very, very weird job.\n\n1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:52.280\n Goodbye camera.\n\n1:37:52.280 --> 1:37:53.160\n I saw it die.\n\n1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:55.840\n Yeah, the camera, we don't need it.\n\n1:37:55.840 --> 1:37:56.680\n But one of the cameras died.\n\n1:37:56.680 --> 1:37:58.640\n Luckily we have another five.\n\n1:37:58.640 --> 1:37:59.880\n Yeah, I know.\n\n1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:02.080\n Like this is where this triggers the spiral,\n\n1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:04.720\n Alexis is gonna go to A to death now.\n\n1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:06.380\n It's still somehow awake.\n\n1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:12.680\n Is there advice you can give about the dark places\n\n1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:15.080\n you've gone in your mind, the depression you suffered from,\n\n1:38:15.080 --> 1:38:18.560\n how to get out from your own story?\n\n1:38:18.560 --> 1:38:21.480\n Whenever I go to those really dark places,\n\n1:38:21.480 --> 1:38:24.760\n the scariest thing is that it feels like\n\n1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:27.560\n I will never get rid of this feeling\n\n1:38:27.560 --> 1:38:29.620\n and it is very overwhelming.\n\n1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:36.680\n And I just have to kind of look back over time spans\n\n1:38:37.180 --> 1:38:39.860\n and remember that every single time I have got through it\n\n1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:42.640\n and remind myself that it is just temporary.\n\n1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:45.020\n And that has been the most helpful thing for me\n\n1:38:45.020 --> 1:38:47.920\n because I just try to combat the scariest thing about it.\n\n1:38:49.760 --> 1:38:52.600\n And then believe, have faith that it's gonna,\n\n1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:53.680\n like this will go away.\n\n1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:57.000\n And take action obviously to make sure it goes away.\n\n1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.480\n And I've also tried to spin it as depression\n\n1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:01.240\n is one of the hardest things I've had to deal with,\n\n1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:03.480\n but also one of the biggest motivators\n\n1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:06.400\n because if I just am left with my own brain,\n\n1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:07.820\n I get very depressed.\n\n1:39:07.820 --> 1:39:10.640\n Then I really like working or focusing on things.\n\n1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:13.520\n So it actually pushed me to try to focus on school,\n\n1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:16.080\n try to focus on chess, focus on whatever I'm doing.\n\n1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:18.000\n And also if I'm feeling really bad,\n\n1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.680\n then there's probably something a little bit off\n\n1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:23.360\n and I use it as a signal and try to think of it as,\n\n1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:25.440\n okay, this is just a sign that there's things\n\n1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.760\n that could be improved for long term.\n\n1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:28.880\n What about you, Andrea?\n\n1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:31.400\n Have you gone to dark places in your mind?\n\n1:39:31.400 --> 1:39:36.360\n I'd say my family, like I see Alex going through this,\n\n1:39:36.360 --> 1:39:38.840\n my mom also has very serious depression.\n\n1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:41.560\n Luckily, I got the genes where I don't go through\n\n1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:44.600\n that serious level of depression that they do.\n\n1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:47.240\n I'd say mine is much more temporarily.\n\n1:39:47.240 --> 1:39:50.020\n So it's more similar to what I was feeling\n\n1:39:50.020 --> 1:39:51.880\n when I was feeling shitty about it.\n\n1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:53.440\n Exactly, you go through periods, yes, exactly,\n\n1:39:53.440 --> 1:39:55.840\n where like, but I know that it's not something\n\n1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:00.280\n that's clinical and that's just a genetic thing\n\n1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:02.720\n or a mental thing, whereas I know it's more serious\n\n1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:04.680\n for like my family members.\n\n1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:06.800\n And I did relate a lot with you where you're saying\n\n1:40:06.800 --> 1:40:08.840\n where that really pushes you and I felt that a lot\n\n1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:12.280\n through content where you just kind of feel hopeless\n\n1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:14.680\n and kind of like an existential crisis\n\n1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:16.240\n where I don't like the content I'm doing\n\n1:40:16.240 --> 1:40:18.440\n and that's what pushes me to like, okay,\n\n1:40:18.440 --> 1:40:20.300\n you have no choice but to try something\n\n1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:21.760\n that now you're gonna be passionate about\n\n1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:22.880\n because otherwise you're gonna be stuck\n\n1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:24.920\n in this never ending cycle.\n\n1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:28.600\n So it's short term and then it helps me come up\n\n1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:31.080\n with the things that I enjoy the most content wise\n\n1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:33.480\n and it also long term taught me just how to have\n\n1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:36.000\n a more balanced life, like doing small things\n\n1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:37.640\n that make me happier on a daily basis,\n\n1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:39.840\n to like working out, to eating healthier,\n\n1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:42.180\n which I notice when I don't do for weeks,\n\n1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:43.780\n I just get a lot more depressed.\n\n1:40:44.960 --> 1:40:48.720\n What has playing chess taught you about life?\n\n1:40:48.720 --> 1:40:52.880\n Has it made you better at life in any kind of way\n\n1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:54.240\n or has it made you worse?\n\n1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:56.800\n You know, a lot of people kind of romanticize the idea\n\n1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:59.880\n that chess is kind of like life or life is kind of like chess\n\n1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:03.240\n and becoming better at making decisions on the chess board\n\n1:41:03.240 --> 1:41:06.120\n is gonna make you better at making decisions in life.\n\n1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:07.520\n Is there some truth to that?\n\n1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:11.880\n I always shy away from these comparisons\n\n1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:14.140\n with chess and life.\n\n1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:17.680\n Cause yeah, it has both positives and negatives.\n\n1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:21.000\n So one thing it really helps develop from an early age\n\n1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.160\n is having an analytical mind,\n\n1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:25.880\n but then you could also get like paralysis of analysis\n\n1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:28.200\n where you've just thought of everything to death\n\n1:41:28.200 --> 1:41:29.520\n and you're moving too slowly\n\n1:41:29.520 --> 1:41:31.320\n when you just have to keep going forward\n\n1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:33.560\n cause there's not a great path ahead.\n\n1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:38.560\n So it's more like exercising your brain and staying sharp\n\n1:41:39.660 --> 1:41:41.360\n and then also applying that to other things.\n\n1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:43.000\n Whereas if instead of playing chess,\n\n1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:44.520\n you were watching TV or something like that,\n\n1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:47.200\n you'd probably end up being less sharp.\n\n1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:49.840\n Yeah, I used to, in high school,\n\n1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:50.880\n I'd always preach like,\n\n1:41:50.880 --> 1:41:55.080\n ah, chess transfers to life skills that I would teach.\n\n1:41:55.080 --> 1:41:56.960\n I taught chess for juvenile department\n\n1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:58.360\n for a special education school.\n\n1:41:58.360 --> 1:42:00.860\n I'd cite studies in prisons where like,\n\n1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:02.920\n oh, playing chess helped them with X\n\n1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:05.240\n and for your kids, it helps with teamwork\n\n1:42:05.240 --> 1:42:07.360\n and thinking over life choices.\n\n1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:09.920\n And now that I'm older, I don't believe in any of that BS.\n\n1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:14.920\n But I do think that the process of working really hard\n\n1:42:15.700 --> 1:42:18.660\n at something which takes really long to see results\n\n1:42:18.660 --> 1:42:20.160\n and you have to be really dedicated.\n\n1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:22.940\n And like, I remember in high school and in middle school,\n\n1:42:22.940 --> 1:42:25.500\n well, all my friends, they were having fun on the weekends\n\n1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:27.760\n and I'd have to be there studying as a chess a day\n\n1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:29.600\n and knowing one day I'll pay off,\n\n1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:32.600\n but for like two, three years, nothing paid off.\n\n1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:35.920\n Kind of learning that type of patience with anything,\n\n1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:37.840\n it's like, you know, like getting a real job.\n\n1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:41.280\n I can't say I ever really worked a real job in my life\n\n1:42:41.280 --> 1:42:42.760\n since I went straight into streaming\n\n1:42:42.760 --> 1:42:44.660\n and I got to work for myself,\n\n1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:47.640\n but I'd say it's what people go to college for.\n\n1:42:47.640 --> 1:42:49.360\n Like they learn how to live in the real world\n\n1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:52.360\n and I'd say that that's what chess taught me as a kid.\n\n1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:53.360\n When you're streaming,\n\n1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.280\n when you're doing the creative work, do you feel lonely?\n\n1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:01.520\n So a bunch of creators talk about sort of the,\n\n1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:06.320\n it's counterintuitive because you're famous now, you know.\n\n1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:09.680\n Sort of, not quite, but we're very lucky\n\n1:43:09.680 --> 1:43:11.040\n to have each other.\n\n1:43:11.040 --> 1:43:13.320\n So is that the source of the comfort\n\n1:43:13.320 --> 1:43:18.040\n and like, is there some sense where it's isolating\n\n1:43:18.040 --> 1:43:19.240\n to have these personalities,\n\n1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:23.100\n they have to always be having fun, being wild and so on?\n\n1:43:24.100 --> 1:43:25.540\n Or is it actually the opposite?\n\n1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:26.920\n Like, is it a source of comfort\n\n1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:28.920\n to know that there's so many cool people out there\n\n1:43:28.920 --> 1:43:31.320\n that are giving you their love?\n\n1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:34.240\n It started as a source of comfort\n\n1:43:34.240 --> 1:43:37.000\n because it started with a very small community\n\n1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:38.640\n who would be something,\n\n1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:41.260\n it would be around 200 to 300 viewers\n\n1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:43.320\n and you know, only like 30 to 40 of them\n\n1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:45.020\n would actually chat actively.\n\n1:43:45.020 --> 1:43:47.960\n So you felt like it was a community, not an audience.\n\n1:43:47.960 --> 1:43:49.480\n So you like knew them personally almost.\n\n1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:50.320\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:53.040\n And it was people who were interested in chess\n\n1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:55.200\n and I would really enjoy that.\n\n1:43:55.200 --> 1:43:58.160\n And then as, you know, we started growing bigger,\n\n1:43:58.160 --> 1:43:59.860\n the audience kind of changed\n\n1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:03.280\n where they're not there for you personally,\n\n1:44:03.280 --> 1:44:05.680\n they're there while you're entertaining\n\n1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:08.360\n and it changed for me.\n\n1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:11.160\n And I ended up being a lot more self conscious\n\n1:44:11.160 --> 1:44:14.280\n of things online and started even thinking of myself\n\n1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:17.120\n more like a product than a human being when I'm online\n\n1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:18.000\n because I had to.\n\n1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:18.920\n Brand.\n\n1:44:18.920 --> 1:44:19.880\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:22.080\n Otherwise you just start taking everything personally\n\n1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:23.440\n that people comment about you\n\n1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:26.320\n and it's based off a very small clip.\n\n1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:28.720\n I see, so it was almost a kind of a defense mechanism.\n\n1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:30.400\n Exactly.\n\n1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:32.800\n And it took time to get enough,\n\n1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:34.640\n because even if you have tough skin,\n\n1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:36.240\n eventually it gets to you when you're online\n\n1:44:36.240 --> 1:44:38.200\n every single day listening to, you know,\n\n1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:40.100\n thousands of people's feedback on you.\n\n1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.760\n I think the loneliest part of being creator\n\n1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:45.120\n is going through burnout,\n\n1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:48.720\n which everyone is just, it's bound to happen,\n\n1:44:48.720 --> 1:44:50.200\n which is why I think we're very lucky\n\n1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.360\n that we have each other because right,\n\n1:44:52.360 --> 1:44:55.240\n it's a numbers game and you're viral and trendy\n\n1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:58.000\n at one point and then you have to fall.\n\n1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:00.080\n And then there's months where you're just grinding.\n\n1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:01.720\n And I just come into my friends room and I'm like,\n\n1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:02.880\n Andrea, we're irrelevant.\n\n1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:06.880\n That's where I'm glad, that's really like the worst part\n\n1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:08.840\n of being creator and figuring out how to get over that hump.\n\n1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:10.720\n But it makes me very grateful that I have my sister\n\n1:45:10.720 --> 1:45:14.680\n because I know that I'm not the only person going through it.\n\n1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:17.960\n And yeah, I know that most of my creator friends\n\n1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:19.400\n feel very lonely in that process\n\n1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:21.280\n because they don't have someone who's their family\n\n1:45:21.280 --> 1:45:22.680\n and their business partner and they're working\n\n1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:24.040\n by each other side by side.\n\n1:45:24.040 --> 1:45:27.880\n You kind of tie in your self worth to your job\n\n1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:30.440\n and your content and maybe even more extremely\n\n1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:34.600\n than other jobs because you also are the entire company\n\n1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:35.940\n and the entire product.\n\n1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:38.460\n So when things are going well or when things are not,\n\n1:45:38.460 --> 1:45:40.520\n you just need to be careful to not reflect it like,\n\n1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:41.680\n oh, I am doing bad.\n\n1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:44.200\n I am bad rather than the trends have now changed.\n\n1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:45.920\n There's outside things we're gonna keep going\n\n1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:47.780\n and this is just the normal waves,\n\n1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:49.680\n which is how we think about it now.\n\n1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:52.320\n And also just about, are we enjoying this?\n\n1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:53.440\n Is this what we wanna make?\n\n1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:56.280\n But we were stuck in the camp for a while\n\n1:45:56.280 --> 1:46:00.480\n when we 10Xed our viewership after the pandemic\n\n1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:02.280\n because people were home and playing chess.\n\n1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:04.440\n And then of course that dropped by like 70%.\n\n1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:06.640\n And then you see that and you're trying your best\n\n1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:09.360\n and you just kind of have to deal with it and be like,\n\n1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:11.000\n okay, I'm just gonna keep persevering\n\n1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.680\n and maybe it'll get better.\n\n1:46:13.680 --> 1:46:14.560\n That's so fascinating.\n\n1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:19.560\n I mean, this is a struggle of sorts in the 21st century\n\n1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:23.400\n of like how to be an artist, how to be a creator,\n\n1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:27.180\n how to be an interesting mind in response to this algorithm.\n\n1:46:27.180 --> 1:46:30.480\n I'm telling you, turning off views and likes is really good.\n\n1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:32.920\n I don't look at Twitch views for that reason.\n\n1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:34.720\n And I get obsessed with the numbers too.\n\n1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:37.200\n And I know Andrea does, but for me,\n\n1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:39.620\n what I try now is to be more focused in the moment,\n\n1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:42.440\n but Andrea somehow can do it even with the views.\n\n1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:44.360\n So you just, you get, you have fun with it.\n\n1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:48.760\n I'm too much of like a given to the temporary satisfaction.\n\n1:46:48.760 --> 1:46:51.080\n Like I like seeing, I like knowing\n\n1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:52.760\n that if something happens right now,\n\n1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:55.160\n viewership's gonna boost by a couple of hundred\n\n1:46:55.160 --> 1:46:57.180\n and seeing that I'm right, of course.\n\n1:46:57.180 --> 1:46:58.760\n But what about when the viewers start dropping?\n\n1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:00.600\n Exactly, well, and I always,\n\n1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:02.760\n like you just have this intuition now.\n\n1:47:02.760 --> 1:47:05.000\n But I think also the reason that it doesn't affect me\n\n1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:08.880\n so much is when we first started our content journey,\n\n1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.120\n we were only Twitch streamers.\n\n1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:13.320\n And we, our livelihood were based on Twitch viewers.\n\n1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:16.440\n But now like I've learned how to recycle that content\n\n1:47:16.440 --> 1:47:18.840\n into like YouTube and shorts and other things\n\n1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:21.300\n where I know like, okay, if this stream does badly,\n\n1:47:21.300 --> 1:47:22.760\n there's so many more things you can do\n\n1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:24.860\n that also just have a much larger output.\n\n1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:27.840\n So it doesn't get to me as much as it did.\n\n1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:29.720\n Do you ever feel that with your podcasts\n\n1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:32.400\n or do you feel like it's been authentic since the start?\n\n1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:35.240\n No, so there's a million things to say there.\n\n1:47:35.240 --> 1:47:40.240\n So one is there's a reason I stopped taking a salary at MIT\n\n1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:45.240\n and moved to Texas is I wanted my bank account to go to zero\n\n1:47:46.100 --> 1:47:48.680\n because I do my best with my back against the wall.\n\n1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:50.620\n So one of the comforts I have is I don't care\n\n1:47:50.620 --> 1:47:52.720\n if this podcast is popular or not.\n\n1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:54.700\n I want it to not be popular.\n\n1:47:54.700 --> 1:47:56.180\n So I don't want it to make money.\n\n1:47:56.180 --> 1:47:57.100\n You're failing Lex.\n\n1:47:57.100 --> 1:47:59.800\n Yeah, I wanna, I mean, I just do best\n\n1:47:59.800 --> 1:48:03.060\n when I'm more desperate.\n\n1:48:03.060 --> 1:48:04.420\n That's like one thing to say.\n\n1:48:04.420 --> 1:48:06.100\n Seems like a reoccurring theme\n\n1:48:06.100 --> 1:48:08.580\n with how you build up your greatest work,\n\n1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:10.860\n which is honestly very respectable.\n\n1:48:10.860 --> 1:48:14.220\n Yeah, so thank you.\n\n1:48:14.220 --> 1:48:15.540\n This is like.\n\n1:48:15.540 --> 1:48:17.020\n I wouldn't recommend.\n\n1:48:17.020 --> 1:48:20.420\n Right, thank you for finding the silver lining\n\n1:48:20.420 --> 1:48:23.140\n for an unhealthy mental state.\n\n1:48:24.180 --> 1:48:26.540\n But the other thing is I was very conscious\n\n1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:29.700\n just like with chess and those kinds of things\n\n1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:31.940\n that I love numbers.\n\n1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:35.020\n And I would be, if I paid attention,\n\n1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:38.300\n if I tried to be somebody at their best,\n\n1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:42.860\n like Mr. Beast who really pays attention to numbers,\n\n1:48:42.860 --> 1:48:46.060\n I would just not, I'd become destroyed by it.\n\n1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:48.780\n The highs and the lows of it.\n\n1:48:48.780 --> 1:48:50.660\n And I just don't think I would be creating\n\n1:48:50.660 --> 1:48:54.220\n the best work possible.\n\n1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:59.220\n But one of the big benefits of a podcast,\n\n1:48:59.220 --> 1:49:02.780\n it's listeners and there's an intimacy with the voice.\n\n1:49:02.780 --> 1:49:06.500\n And I think that is much more stable\n\n1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:10.900\n and a deeper and a more meaningful connection than YouTube.\n\n1:49:10.900 --> 1:49:13.140\n YouTube is a fickle mistress.\n\n1:49:13.140 --> 1:49:18.140\n So it's a weird drug that like, it really wants you.\n\n1:49:18.500 --> 1:49:20.060\n With very addicting feedback loops.\n\n1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:23.420\n When you have a video that's number one out of 10,\n\n1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:25.860\n oh my God, the adrenaline you get.\n\n1:49:25.860 --> 1:49:28.680\n And then the thing I really don't like also\n\n1:49:28.680 --> 1:49:33.680\n is the world will introduce you as a person\n\n1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.680\n that has a video on YouTube with some X number of views.\n\n1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:42.300\n Like the world wants you to be addicted to these numbers.\n\n1:49:42.300 --> 1:49:43.140\n What?\n\n1:49:43.140 --> 1:49:45.200\n Because they associate it with having done a good job.\n\n1:49:45.200 --> 1:49:46.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:46.040 --> 1:49:47.240\n Because that's what people think views are,\n\n1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:48.120\n even if it's not.\n\n1:49:48.120 --> 1:49:48.960\n Right.\n\n1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:52.280\n And primarily because they don't have any other signal\n\n1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:53.700\n of what's a good job.\n\n1:49:53.700 --> 1:49:56.160\n I think the much better signal is people\n\n1:49:56.160 --> 1:49:59.020\n that are close to you, your family, your colleagues,\n\n1:49:59.020 --> 1:50:00.760\n that say, wow, that was cool, I listened to that,\n\n1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:02.680\n that was really, I didn't know this,\n\n1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:05.760\n this was really powerful, this is really moving and so on.\n\n1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:08.040\n But definitely I'm terrified of numbers.\n\n1:50:08.040 --> 1:50:10.680\n Because I feel like, just like I said,\n\n1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:15.680\n I'd rather be a Stanley Kubrick, right?\n\n1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:20.320\n You'd rather create great art,\n\n1:50:21.620 --> 1:50:22.580\n not to be pretentious,\n\n1:50:22.580 --> 1:50:24.740\n but the best possible thing you can create.\n\n1:50:24.740 --> 1:50:26.040\n Whatever the beauty that's,\n\n1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:28.480\n the capacity for creating beauty that's in you,\n\n1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:29.720\n I would like to maximize that.\n\n1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:32.400\n And I feel like for some people like Mr. Beast,\n\n1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:35.080\n I think those are perfectly aligned.\n\n1:50:35.080 --> 1:50:37.660\n Because he just loves the most epic thing possible,\n\n1:50:37.660 --> 1:50:38.680\n but not for everybody.\n\n1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:39.840\n I think there's a lot of people\n\n1:50:39.840 --> 1:50:42.360\n for whom that's not perfectly aligned.\n\n1:50:42.360 --> 1:50:44.760\n And so I'm definitely one of those.\n\n1:50:44.760 --> 1:50:46.240\n And I'm still really confused\n\n1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:48.040\n why anybody listens to this anyway.\n\n1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:53.080\n But that's also something I guess you're trying to find,\n\n1:50:53.080 --> 1:50:54.240\n trying to figure out.\n\n1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:58.120\n I get very afraid of ever becoming someone\n\n1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:00.080\n who just makes junk food content,\n\n1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:03.600\n where you can't stop while you're in the moment,\n\n1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:05.320\n and it has all of your attention,\n\n1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:06.640\n but when you're done,\n\n1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:09.740\n it didn't really bring any value to your life,\n\n1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:11.920\n which is something that I think the algorithm\n\n1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:14.220\n still does really reward.\n\n1:51:14.220 --> 1:51:16.760\n And making sure that as we are learning\n\n1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:18.160\n how to create better content,\n\n1:51:18.160 --> 1:51:21.280\n it's still something that is gonna be meaningful long term.\n\n1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:25.120\n Well, ultimately, you inspire a lot of young people.\n\n1:51:26.920 --> 1:51:27.920\n Yeah, those are the best.\n\n1:51:27.920 --> 1:51:30.200\n When I get messages from people who are like,\n\n1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:33.160\n I played you a year ago, and my rating was 1400,\n\n1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.200\n and now I'm 1900.\n\n1:51:34.200 --> 1:51:35.480\n I'd like to challenge you again.\n\n1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.080\n It's a 14 year old writing a former email.\n\n1:51:38.080 --> 1:51:40.720\n Those things are always very, very fun to get.\n\n1:51:40.720 --> 1:51:42.240\n And even just outside of chess,\n\n1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:44.080\n it's just empowering to see,\n\n1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:46.720\n like for young women too, to see that kind of thing.\n\n1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:50.080\n I mean, you guys are being yourself,\n\n1:51:50.080 --> 1:51:51.880\n and making money for being yourself,\n\n1:51:51.880 --> 1:51:54.880\n and having fun, and growing as human beings,\n\n1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:57.680\n which I think is really inspiring for people to see.\n\n1:51:57.680 --> 1:51:59.300\n So in that sense, it's really rewarding.\n\n1:51:59.300 --> 1:52:01.780\n And then the way I think about it is\n\n1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:06.440\n there is some benefit of doing entertaining type of stuff\n\n1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:09.020\n so that you get the,\n\n1:52:10.600 --> 1:52:13.320\n kind of like Mr. Beast does with philanthropy, right?\n\n1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:15.080\n The bigger Mr. Beast becomes,\n\n1:52:15.080 --> 1:52:16.880\n the more effective he is at actually doing\n\n1:52:16.880 --> 1:52:18.380\n positive impact on the world.\n\n1:52:18.380 --> 1:52:22.320\n So those things are tied together.\n\n1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:25.440\n But of course, with podcasts, you guys,\n\n1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:28.120\n well, maybe you have these kinds of tense things,\n\n1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:31.960\n but what kind of ideas, what kind of people do platform?\n\n1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:33.440\n What kind of person,\n\n1:52:36.120 --> 1:52:38.160\n what kind of human being do you wanna be?\n\n1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:42.120\n Because you are actually becoming a person,\n\n1:52:42.120 --> 1:52:47.120\n and a set of ideas in front of the public eye,\n\n1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.480\n and you have to ask yourself that question really hard,\n\n1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:50.880\n like really seriously.\n\n1:52:50.880 --> 1:52:54.520\n Because if you're doing stuff in private,\n\n1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:57.240\n you have the complete luxury to try shit out.\n\n1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:58.240\n Right.\n\n1:52:58.240 --> 1:53:01.260\n I think you have less of a luxury to try shit out\n\n1:53:01.260 --> 1:53:04.240\n because the internet can be vicious in punishing you\n\n1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:05.640\n for trying shit out.\n\n1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:07.640\n And do you think that's sometimes a bad thing\n\n1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:10.060\n where you have less freedom to make mistakes?\n\n1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:12.840\n Yeah, you have two choices.\n\n1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:14.920\n So one, you put up a wall\n\n1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:17.720\n and say I don't give a shit what people think.\n\n1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:18.560\n I don't like doing that\n\n1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:20.220\n because I like being fragile to the world,\n\n1:53:20.220 --> 1:53:23.320\n keeping my, sort of wearing my heart on my sleeve.\n\n1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:26.060\n Or the other one, yeah, you have to be,\n\n1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:30.560\n you have to actually think through what you're gonna say.\n\n1:53:30.560 --> 1:53:33.720\n You have to think of like, what do I believe?\n\n1:53:33.720 --> 1:53:38.640\n You have to be more serious about what you put out there.\n\n1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:41.360\n It's annoying, but it's also actually,\n\n1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:43.600\n you should have always been doing that.\n\n1:53:43.600 --> 1:53:46.500\n You should be deliberate with your actions and your words.\n\n1:53:48.680 --> 1:53:49.960\n But I don't know, it's,\n\n1:53:49.960 --> 1:53:54.040\n but some of it, it's such a balance\n\n1:53:54.040 --> 1:53:57.760\n because some of my favorite people are brilliant people\n\n1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:01.280\n that allow themselves to act ridiculous and be silly.\n\n1:54:01.280 --> 1:54:03.800\n Elon Musk, who's become a good friend,\n\n1:54:03.800 --> 1:54:05.440\n is the silliest human of all.\n\n1:54:05.440 --> 1:54:09.720\n I mean, he's incredibly brilliant and productive and so on,\n\n1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:11.820\n but allows themselves to be silly.\n\n1:54:11.820 --> 1:54:13.640\n And that's also inspiring to people.\n\n1:54:13.640 --> 1:54:15.480\n Like you don't have to be perfect.\n\n1:54:15.480 --> 1:54:19.800\n You don't have to, you can be a weird, a giant weird mess.\n\n1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:20.880\n Then it's okay.\n\n1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:22.600\n So it's a balance.\n\n1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:25.040\n I think when you start to delve into political topics,\n\n1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:28.240\n into topics that really get tense for people,\n\n1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:31.320\n then you have to be a little bit more careful and deliberate.\n\n1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:33.360\n But it's also wise to stay the hell away\n\n1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:35.440\n from those topics in general.\n\n1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:36.820\n Like I mentioned to you offline,\n\n1:54:36.820 --> 1:54:39.840\n somebody I've been debating whether I want to talk to\n\n1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:42.080\n or not is Karjakin on the chess board\n\n1:54:42.080 --> 1:54:45.160\n because chess is just a game,\n\n1:54:45.160 --> 1:54:48.480\n but throughout the history of the 20th century,\n\n1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:51.720\n it was played between the Russians and the Americans\n\n1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:56.360\n and so on where they were at war, cold or hot war.\n\n1:54:56.360 --> 1:54:57.920\n And those are interesting.\n\n1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:01.500\n Those are interesting conversations to be had\n\n1:55:01.500 --> 1:55:03.280\n at the Olympics and so on.\n\n1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:04.600\n It's not just a game.\n\n1:55:04.600 --> 1:55:05.840\n It's some sense.\n\n1:55:05.840 --> 1:55:07.120\n It's like a mini war.\n\n1:55:08.140 --> 1:55:11.600\n And so I have to decide whether I want to talk to him or not\n\n1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:12.440\n and those kinds of things.\n\n1:55:12.440 --> 1:55:14.440\n You have to make those kinds of decisions.\n\n1:55:14.440 --> 1:55:16.120\n For now, you guys are not playing chess\n\n1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:18.880\n with Donald Trump or Obama or so on.\n\n1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:20.880\n We are not right now, no.\n\n1:55:20.880 --> 1:55:22.160\n How long is a stream?\n\n1:55:22.160 --> 1:55:23.240\n Like a few hours, right?\n\n1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:24.840\n Now they're two to three hours.\n\n1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:26.040\n When I was first streaming,\n\n1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:28.480\n I'd stream for like six hours a day.\n\n1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:29.320\n A day.\n\n1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:30.440\n At least usually.\n\n1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.320\n Yeah, for like six to seven days a week.\n\n1:55:33.320 --> 1:55:34.840\n Are you doing just like a talking one?\n\n1:55:34.840 --> 1:55:38.280\n No, I'd be playing chess the entire time while talking.\n\n1:55:38.280 --> 1:55:41.320\n And when I started streaming,\n\n1:55:42.180 --> 1:55:44.440\n that's kind of how everybody blows up on Twitch.\n\n1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:47.360\n You're just putting in crazy hours and you're always there.\n\n1:55:47.360 --> 1:55:49.200\n It's not about making the best content.\n\n1:55:49.200 --> 1:55:51.480\n It's about letting people feel\n\n1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:53.400\n like they're hanging out with you\n\n1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:55.800\n and just being on as much as you can.\n\n1:55:55.800 --> 1:55:58.120\n But I ended up feeling very burnt out\n\n1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:00.400\n because it's hard to be your best self\n\n1:56:00.400 --> 1:56:02.400\n when you're in front of a camera for that long\n\n1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:06.580\n because you do get scared of going into places\n\n1:56:06.580 --> 1:56:09.460\n where you want to learn, but you might not be the best in.\n\n1:56:09.460 --> 1:56:10.920\n Because it's harder to learn in public\n\n1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:12.080\n than do something that like,\n\n1:56:12.080 --> 1:56:14.840\n yeah, we're better than 99% of our viewers at chess.\n\n1:56:14.840 --> 1:56:18.480\n So that's a lot less scary than trying to play a game\n\n1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:20.120\n that you're bad at or discuss topics\n\n1:56:20.120 --> 1:56:21.360\n that you're interested in.\n\n1:56:22.600 --> 1:56:26.720\n Yeah, have the beginner's mind and be dumb at something.\n\n1:56:26.720 --> 1:56:27.560\n Right.\n\n1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:28.880\n Yeah, which is where the fun is\n\n1:56:28.880 --> 1:56:30.080\n and you get to learn together,\n\n1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:32.280\n but people punish you for it on the internet.\n\n1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:35.960\n What about you, Andrea?\n\n1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:38.300\n Yeah, I think like Alex said at the beginning,\n\n1:56:38.300 --> 1:56:39.760\n when we were grinding a lot,\n\n1:56:39.760 --> 1:56:43.080\n you don't really even have time for much of a private life\n\n1:56:43.080 --> 1:56:45.560\n because you're streaming every hour of your life\n\n1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:49.160\n and people want it, like the appeal of streamers,\n\n1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:50.600\n it's called like being parasocial\n\n1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:52.080\n where you feel like they're your friend\n\n1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:54.600\n and they like it because they want you\n\n1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:57.120\n to share everything about your life.\n\n1:56:57.120 --> 1:56:59.880\n Really the main challenge for me at first\n\n1:56:59.880 --> 1:57:03.840\n when trying to prioritize quantity over quality,\n\n1:57:03.840 --> 1:57:05.440\n which we're not doing anymore,\n\n1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:08.560\n was realizing that I can't turn everything I'm interested in\n\n1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:10.780\n and every passion into content.\n\n1:57:11.920 --> 1:57:14.120\n Before I'm like, well, I must stream more,\n\n1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:16.920\n but I like music and I like playing piano\n\n1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:20.200\n and I like reading into these topics and I like fitness\n\n1:57:20.200 --> 1:57:22.000\n and then I try to live stream all of it\n\n1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.680\n and that's just, at some point it's like,\n\n1:57:24.680 --> 1:57:27.500\n just enjoy your time off for those hobbies\n\n1:57:27.500 --> 1:57:28.920\n and prioritize what you're good at\n\n1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:32.680\n because that's just gonna be better for the channel overall.\n\n1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:34.360\n So that was a learning lesson for sure.\n\n1:57:34.360 --> 1:57:36.500\n It's nice because there are some intersections\n\n1:57:36.500 --> 1:57:38.920\n when I have tried new things that I really enjoy\n\n1:57:38.920 --> 1:57:41.720\n and it pays off, but that's less often.\n\n1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:43.480\n So it's more like you can be yourself,\n\n1:57:43.480 --> 1:57:46.640\n but only specific parts of yourself online\n\n1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:50.720\n and the rest, sometimes it's nice to just keep private\n\n1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:55.720\n and feel that you could just give it your 100% freedom.\n\n1:57:56.840 --> 1:58:01.840\n See, I feel like I try to be the exact same person\n\n1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:03.960\n on podcasts as in private life.\n\n1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:06.840\n I really don't like hiding anything.\n\n1:58:06.840 --> 1:58:08.600\n But you're also a generalist, right?\n\n1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:10.280\n Where you have people with all topics.\n\n1:58:10.280 --> 1:58:13.480\n For us, we built our audience off a very specific thing\n\n1:58:13.480 --> 1:58:15.080\n so people sometimes feel like,\n\n1:58:15.080 --> 1:58:17.000\n even at the start when we started playing less chess,\n\n1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.900\n they're like, I subbed for chess.\n\n1:58:18.900 --> 1:58:20.960\n Why are you not playing chess?\n\n1:58:20.960 --> 1:58:21.800\n Exactly.\n\n1:58:21.800 --> 1:58:23.960\n People are tuning in for an interesting conversation\n\n1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:25.000\n on a bunch of topics.\n\n1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000\n So like the more you are yourself, the better it is,\n\n1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.080\n but it is very hard when you build your brand\n\n1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:31.880\n on like one type of gaming content.\n\n1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:34.680\n Build your brand.\n\n1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:36.480\n But yeah, the way you become a generalist\n\n1:58:36.480 --> 1:58:38.960\n is you slowly expand.\n\n1:58:38.960 --> 1:58:42.960\n It's like expand to checkers.\n\n1:58:45.120 --> 1:58:47.520\n I guess that's like a downward.\n\n1:58:47.520 --> 1:58:48.600\n Maybe poker.\n\n1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:50.000\n Poker, yeah, exactly, poker.\n\n1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.940\n But also just the ideas, the space of ideas.\n\n1:58:52.940 --> 1:58:54.300\n And one of the cool things about chess\n\n1:58:54.300 --> 1:58:56.720\n is when you're talking over the chess board,\n\n1:58:56.720 --> 1:58:59.920\n you're, it's a kind of podcast, you know?\n\n1:58:59.920 --> 1:59:02.700\n That is actually an idea we've had with playing chess\n\n1:59:02.700 --> 1:59:05.400\n while also doing a podcast and talking with people.\n\n1:59:05.400 --> 1:59:06.720\n It's kind of like an icebreaker.\n\n1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:08.960\n We're also focusing on the game at the same time.\n\n1:59:08.960 --> 1:59:11.340\n But you know, we are slowly evolving\n\n1:59:11.340 --> 1:59:12.480\n and we're doing more things.\n\n1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:15.060\n Like one thing we wanted to do is spend less time\n\n1:59:15.060 --> 1:59:16.240\n in front of the computer.\n\n1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:18.120\n So now we're doing a chess travel show\n\n1:59:18.120 --> 1:59:19.440\n where we go to different countries\n\n1:59:19.440 --> 1:59:20.840\n and look at the chess culture.\n\n1:59:20.840 --> 1:59:23.080\n So it actually feels like we're doing things\n\n1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:25.980\n that we would want to do and explore anyway.\n\n1:59:25.980 --> 1:59:28.560\n And maybe it's not as much in the idea space,\n\n1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:31.580\n which we both enjoy and do a lot in our own free time,\n\n1:59:31.580 --> 1:59:34.760\n but in the sharing cool experiences with our audience\n\n1:59:34.760 --> 1:59:36.000\n that we actually want to do.\n\n1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:37.640\n Where do you look forward to going?\n\n1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:41.320\n We're going to Romania on September 9th.\n\n1:59:41.320 --> 1:59:44.340\n And I think this is the most exciting for me\n\n1:59:44.340 --> 1:59:46.440\n because we're going back to, you know,\n\n1:59:46.440 --> 1:59:48.880\n the country where our entire family's from,\n\n1:59:48.880 --> 1:59:51.320\n where our grandmother taught our dad\n\n1:59:51.320 --> 1:59:52.960\n who taught us how to play chess.\n\n1:59:52.960 --> 1:59:54.960\n It has a very strong chess culture.\n\n1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:58.920\n So it'll be very unique to go back and see\n\n1:59:58.920 --> 2:00:00.600\n how everything is when we haven't been back\n\n2:00:00.600 --> 2:00:01.640\n for a very long time.\n\n2:00:01.640 --> 2:00:04.680\n And for Romanians, like it's very rare\n\n2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:06.200\n when there's like a famous Romanian\n\n2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:07.880\n who accomplishes something,\n\n2:00:07.880 --> 2:00:09.080\n which is why like right now,\n\n2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:10.800\n Andrew Tate's the most famous Romanian.\n\n2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:12.640\n But he's banned for a bad reason.\n\n2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:13.680\n Exactly.\n\n2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:15.400\n And there's like something very special\n\n2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:17.400\n about Romanian pride.\n\n2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:19.640\n And when we meet fellow Romanians in the US,\n\n2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:22.120\n like it's just an amazing connection.\n\n2:00:22.120 --> 2:00:24.640\n And like, I hear the way my dad talk about like,\n\n2:00:24.640 --> 2:00:28.560\n for example, Nadia, who was a famous Romanian gymnast\n\n2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:30.080\n and he's like, yeah, like Romania,\n\n2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:31.180\n we sucked at everything.\n\n2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:34.560\n But when she won the Olympics for gymnast,\n\n2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:36.440\n every kid on the street was doing gymnastics\n\n2:00:36.440 --> 2:00:38.440\n because it's very rare that they make it\n\n2:00:38.440 --> 2:00:39.480\n to that level of success.\n\n2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:40.840\n And I'm not saying that we're super successful,\n\n2:00:40.840 --> 2:00:42.780\n super famous, but it is really cool\n\n2:00:42.780 --> 2:00:44.120\n to meet other Romanians through chess\n\n2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:45.920\n because it's a very special bond.\n\n2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:50.400\n Yeah, you feel like it's a community and like you belong.\n\n2:00:50.400 --> 2:00:53.320\n Yeah, you can't get that anywhere else.\n\n2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:55.560\n Let me ask your opinion since you mentioned him,\n\n2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:59.680\n Andrew Tate, you're both women, successful women,\n\n2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:01.200\n you're both creators.\n\n2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.720\n So Andrew Tate is an example of somebody\n\n2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:06.160\n that has become exceptionally successful\n\n2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:10.320\n at galvanizing public attention,\n\n2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:13.600\n but he's also, from many perspective, a misogynist.\n\n2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:16.680\n So let me ask a personal question.\n\n2:01:16.680 --> 2:01:19.180\n Do you think I should talk to him on this podcast?\n\n2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:24.180\n How would you feel as a fan as somebody,\n\n2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:29.420\n I'm talking to the great Alex and Andrea Botez\n\n2:01:29.420 --> 2:01:32.220\n and the next episode is with Andrew Tate?\n\n2:01:32.220 --> 2:01:34.560\n I think it's a double edged sword\n\n2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:37.860\n and most of these things are not as black and white\n\n2:01:37.860 --> 2:01:39.940\n as they seem, you know,\n\n2:01:39.940 --> 2:01:43.340\n because on one hand, I don't agree with his beliefs\n\n2:01:43.340 --> 2:01:45.900\n and I think he said a lot of things that are very hurtful\n\n2:01:45.900 --> 2:01:49.460\n and that influence people's opinions.\n\n2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:54.820\n At the same time, talking to someone through that\n\n2:01:54.820 --> 2:01:57.100\n and trying to get to the root of it\n\n2:01:57.100 --> 2:02:01.020\n and how much of it he used just as a social media tactic\n\n2:02:01.020 --> 2:02:03.580\n to maybe change the opinion of people\n\n2:02:03.580 --> 2:02:06.500\n who have been so influenced by him towards\n\n2:02:06.500 --> 2:02:08.980\n something that is maybe more understanding towards women\n\n2:02:08.980 --> 2:02:12.460\n or things like that could do some good,\n\n2:02:12.460 --> 2:02:15.220\n but at the same time, platforming someone like that\n\n2:02:15.220 --> 2:02:18.260\n and giving them more attention also signals to other people\n\n2:02:18.260 --> 2:02:20.060\n who have a platform that it's okay,\n\n2:02:20.060 --> 2:02:22.580\n so it's kind of weighing the pluses and the minuses\n\n2:02:22.580 --> 2:02:25.980\n and it's a very tough decision because it's not clear.\n\n2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:28.260\n And the thing about the internet,\n\n2:02:28.260 --> 2:02:30.440\n you make the wrong decision, you're gonna pay for it.\n\n2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:31.280\n Right.\n\n2:02:32.580 --> 2:02:34.620\n That's the thing, like personally,\n\n2:02:34.620 --> 2:02:37.340\n and it is funny, like I think the whole way\n\n2:02:37.340 --> 2:02:39.060\n you rose to fame is just a growth hack\n\n2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:40.420\n and I've seen other people do it\n\n2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:42.680\n where like you just say kind of,\n\n2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:45.680\n I don't, honestly, I don't really listen to his content\n\n2:02:45.680 --> 2:02:46.980\n because I just find it so dumb,\n\n2:02:46.980 --> 2:02:49.620\n but I think he knows that by saying the dumbest,\n\n2:02:49.620 --> 2:02:52.860\n most controversial things, that's like a quick rise to fame\n\n2:02:52.860 --> 2:02:56.460\n and I think surface level, like he can really hold it up,\n\n2:02:56.460 --> 2:02:58.620\n but that's why I would honestly enjoy tuning\n\n2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:00.780\n into a conversation where you're really breaking down\n\n2:03:00.780 --> 2:03:02.140\n to the core of those beliefs\n\n2:03:02.140 --> 2:03:04.660\n and I think like young kids who look up to him\n\n2:03:04.660 --> 2:03:06.900\n and when you actually hear someone challenging it\n\n2:03:06.900 --> 2:03:09.100\n could actually be helpful for people,\n\n2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:12.300\n but at the same time, it's a lot of bad publicity,\n\n2:03:12.300 --> 2:03:13.880\n people see your podcast, they see, wow,\n\n2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:16.020\n like if they don't know you\n\n2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:17.580\n and they don't know why you're interviewing him\n\n2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:18.920\n and they don't listen, they'll see that\n\n2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:22.320\n and then 100% think it's for the other reason.\n\n2:03:22.320 --> 2:03:24.220\n But I'm also afraid of a society\n\n2:03:24.220 --> 2:03:25.700\n where you can't have discourse\n\n2:03:25.700 --> 2:03:29.000\n with people you disagree with\n\n2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:31.100\n and even though I don't like Andrew Tate,\n\n2:03:31.100 --> 2:03:33.840\n I think the fact that he got banned from all the platforms\n\n2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:36.860\n is kind of scary because it sets a precedent\n\n2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:38.160\n and you always have to ask yourself,\n\n2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:40.660\n would this be ethical if I was on the other side\n\n2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:42.620\n and even things with a president like Trump,\n\n2:03:42.620 --> 2:03:45.700\n even if let's say you're somebody who was on the left,\n\n2:03:45.700 --> 2:03:47.620\n if that would have happened to a leftist president,\n\n2:03:47.620 --> 2:03:48.460\n how would you feel?\n\n2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:49.860\n Would you think that's morally ethical?\n\n2:03:49.860 --> 2:03:54.060\n So that is something that I think is important.\n\n2:03:54.060 --> 2:03:56.380\n We try to find ways to have conversations\n\n2:03:56.380 --> 2:03:59.100\n and reach some mutual understanding\n\n2:03:59.100 --> 2:04:02.100\n and try instead of just amplifying the worst\n\n2:04:02.100 --> 2:04:03.520\n about every human being.\n\n2:04:04.620 --> 2:04:07.560\n Well, so one of the major reasons I'm struggling with\n\n2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:11.580\n is because I really enjoy talking to brilliant women.\n\n2:04:11.580 --> 2:04:14.860\n I think it's also, a lot of women reached out to me\n\n2:04:14.860 --> 2:04:17.900\n saying like, it is what it is,\n\n2:04:17.900 --> 2:04:20.060\n but they're inspired when the female guest is on.\n\n2:04:20.060 --> 2:04:23.260\n And to me, if I talk to somebody like Andrew Tate,\n\n2:04:23.260 --> 2:04:25.440\n even if I have a really hard hitting,\n\n2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:28.300\n I think it could be a very good conversation\n\n2:04:29.460 --> 2:04:32.340\n that lessens the likelihood\n\n2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:37.340\n that a brilliant, powerful female will go on the show.\n\n2:04:37.700 --> 2:04:39.820\n Because they'll never watch it,\n\n2:04:39.820 --> 2:04:41.580\n but the thing we do in this society\n\n2:04:41.580 --> 2:04:42.700\n is we put labels on each other.\n\n2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:46.760\n Well, Lex is the person that platforms misogynists.\n\n2:04:48.100 --> 2:04:53.100\n I did a thing where Joe Rogan got in trouble\n\n2:04:53.340 --> 2:04:56.780\n over an N word controversy earlier in the year.\n\n2:04:56.780 --> 2:04:58.740\n And Joe's a good friend of mine\n\n2:04:58.740 --> 2:05:00.500\n and I said that I stand with Joe,\n\n2:05:00.500 --> 2:05:02.900\n that he's not a racist or something like that.\n\n2:05:02.900 --> 2:05:06.460\n And within certain communities,\n\n2:05:06.460 --> 2:05:09.840\n I'm now somebody who's an apologist for racists, right?\n\n2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:12.340\n Or a racist myself, that kind of thing.\n\n2:05:12.340 --> 2:05:14.620\n And we put labels without ever listening to the content,\n\n2:05:14.620 --> 2:05:17.060\n without ever sort of,\n\n2:05:17.060 --> 2:05:19.540\n actually just even the very simple step\n\n2:05:19.540 --> 2:05:21.680\n or it seems to be difficult of like,\n\n2:05:25.360 --> 2:05:27.180\n taking on the best possible interpretation\n\n2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:28.580\n of what a person said\n\n2:05:28.580 --> 2:05:30.460\n and giving them the benefit of the doubt\n\n2:05:30.460 --> 2:05:31.900\n and having empathy for another person.\n\n2:05:31.900 --> 2:05:34.340\n So you have to play in this field\n\n2:05:34.340 --> 2:05:36.700\n where people will assign labels to each other\n\n2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:39.380\n and it's difficult.\n\n2:05:39.380 --> 2:05:40.760\n But ultimately, I believe,\n\n2:05:40.760 --> 2:05:45.020\n I hope that good conversations is a way\n\n2:05:45.020 --> 2:05:46.780\n to like a greater understanding for people\n\n2:05:46.780 --> 2:05:50.020\n to grow together as a society\n\n2:05:50.020 --> 2:05:51.460\n and improve and learn the lessons,\n\n2:05:51.460 --> 2:05:52.460\n the mistakes of the past.\n\n2:05:52.460 --> 2:05:54.460\n But you also have to play this game\n\n2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.820\n where people just like putting labels on each other\n\n2:05:56.820 --> 2:05:58.540\n and canceling each other over those.\n\n2:05:58.540 --> 2:06:01.580\n Or that guy said one thing nice about Donald Trump,\n\n2:06:01.580 --> 2:06:04.860\n he must be a far right Nazi.\n\n2:06:04.860 --> 2:06:06.300\n Or the opposite,\n\n2:06:06.300 --> 2:06:11.020\n that this person said something nice about the vaccine,\n\n2:06:11.020 --> 2:06:13.780\n he must be a far left whatever,\n\n2:06:13.780 --> 2:06:18.780\n because apologist for whatever, for Fauci.\n\n2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:23.240\n Or most of us I think are ultimately in the middle.\n\n2:06:23.240 --> 2:06:25.540\n It's a weird, it's a weird thing.\n\n2:06:25.540 --> 2:06:28.140\n But I think, and it's also painful on a personal level.\n\n2:06:28.140 --> 2:06:32.020\n Like people have written to me\n\n2:06:32.020 --> 2:06:35.100\n about things like single words,\n\n2:06:35.100 --> 2:06:39.940\n half sentences that I've said about either Putin or Zelensky\n\n2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:42.700\n where they have hate towards me because of what I said.\n\n2:06:43.900 --> 2:06:45.300\n Either both directions.\n\n2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:48.620\n I've now accumulated very passionate people\n\n2:06:48.620 --> 2:06:52.140\n that some call me a Putin apologist,\n\n2:06:52.140 --> 2:06:54.460\n some call me a Zelensky apologist.\n\n2:06:54.460 --> 2:06:58.740\n And it hurts to, given how much I have family there,\n\n2:06:58.740 --> 2:07:00.780\n how much I've seen of suffering there,\n\n2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:02.620\n and to carry that burden over time\n\n2:07:02.620 --> 2:07:04.560\n and not let it destroy you is tough.\n\n2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:07.940\n So like, do you wanna take on another thing like that\n\n2:07:07.940 --> 2:07:09.900\n when you have conversations?\n\n2:07:09.900 --> 2:07:13.140\n Or can I just talk to awesome people like you two?\n\n2:07:13.140 --> 2:07:14.260\n Where it's not that burden.\n\n2:07:14.260 --> 2:07:16.140\n We're not controversial.\n\n2:07:16.140 --> 2:07:17.660\n Or you're interesting, you're fascinating,\n\n2:07:17.660 --> 2:07:21.000\n you're inspiring, you're like fun.\n\n2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:24.980\n Not all those difficult things that come with more difficult\n\n2:07:24.980 --> 2:07:25.820\n conversations.\n\n2:07:25.820 --> 2:07:26.640\n Right.\n\n2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:30.100\n But somebody has to be making those difficult decisions\n\n2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:35.100\n and challenging the notions that we should cancel someone\n\n2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:37.600\n just for slightly disagreeing with us.\n\n2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:40.580\n And it's very hard to take that on personally.\n\n2:07:40.580 --> 2:07:42.220\n And I think that's a huge part of it.\n\n2:07:42.220 --> 2:07:44.220\n When you know it's something you're doing\n\n2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:46.740\n for the right reasons and you're getting a lot of people\n\n2:07:46.740 --> 2:07:51.740\n coming and misinterpreting it, it's very painful.\n\n2:07:52.620 --> 2:07:56.340\n But I think you have to ask yourself long term\n\n2:07:56.340 --> 2:07:58.700\n if when you made that decision, you ultimately thought\n\n2:07:58.700 --> 2:08:01.380\n it would be better or worse for your listeners\n\n2:08:01.380 --> 2:08:02.740\n to know that conversation.\n\n2:08:02.740 --> 2:08:05.780\n And then if you can sleep with it at night, take the risk.\n\n2:08:05.780 --> 2:08:08.540\n Yeah, actually when I talk to people that,\n\n2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:10.460\n especially astrophysicists, and you realize\n\n2:08:10.460 --> 2:08:11.680\n how tiny we are.\n\n2:08:11.680 --> 2:08:12.520\n Right.\n\n2:08:12.520 --> 2:08:14.620\n How incredible, like how huge the universe is.\n\n2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:16.900\n Like you don't, it doesn't matter, you can do anything.\n\n2:08:16.900 --> 2:08:20.820\n You could like, you can walk around naked,\n\n2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:23.260\n talk shit to people, do whatever the hell.\n\n2:08:23.260 --> 2:08:25.520\n And actually in modern social media,\n\n2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:26.940\n people just like forget.\n\n2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:29.100\n It's like, it's ultimately liberating.\n\n2:08:29.100 --> 2:08:32.460\n Just try to do, at least from my perspective,\n\n2:08:32.460 --> 2:08:34.660\n the best possible thing for the world you can.\n\n2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:37.220\n Take big risks, and it doesn't matter.\n\n2:08:37.220 --> 2:08:39.540\n And that's the other thing with being canceled nowadays\n\n2:08:39.540 --> 2:08:43.300\n because everyone's attention is much more shortsighted.\n\n2:08:43.300 --> 2:08:46.060\n You can get canceled and then it'll blow over in three days.\n\n2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.340\n And you actually see things like this on Twitch very often\n\n2:08:48.340 --> 2:08:51.180\n where people just have bursts of outrage\n\n2:08:51.180 --> 2:08:53.200\n and they come into your chat and they're all spamming\n\n2:08:53.200 --> 2:08:55.600\n and saying mean things, and then three days after.\n\n2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:57.880\n And of course they're not actually ever serious things.\n\n2:08:57.880 --> 2:09:00.020\n They're usually like things clipped of any streamers\n\n2:09:00.020 --> 2:09:01.980\n in like their worst moments, but then people forget\n\n2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:03.780\n about it pretty soon after.\n\n2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:06.900\n So you're able to accept that?\n\n2:09:06.900 --> 2:09:09.820\n Like when somebody is being shitty to you for a day?\n\n2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:12.720\n Yeah, I mean, I still get sometimes emotional about it,\n\n2:09:12.720 --> 2:09:14.500\n especially when I'm like, oh wow,\n\n2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:16.660\n these things that are being said are not true\n\n2:09:16.660 --> 2:09:19.220\n or like this was clearly taken out of context,\n\n2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:22.380\n but I've just accepted that it's part of the job.\n\n2:09:22.380 --> 2:09:26.780\n And if I am trying my best and I am trying things\n\n2:09:26.780 --> 2:09:29.180\n with as good intentions as possible,\n\n2:09:29.180 --> 2:09:31.040\n then I just try to learn every time that happens\n\n2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:32.820\n and be like, okay, what could I do better?\n\n2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:34.740\n And what is just part of the job?\n\n2:09:35.700 --> 2:09:37.140\n Well, let's start some controversy.\n\n2:09:37.140 --> 2:09:39.340\n Who's the greatest chess player of all time?\n\n2:09:39.340 --> 2:09:43.260\n Is it Magnus Carlsen, is it Gary Kasparov,\n\n2:09:43.260 --> 2:09:45.340\n is it somebody else, Bobby Fischer?\n\n2:09:46.200 --> 2:09:48.300\n Do you have a favorite, Alex?\n\n2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:50.780\n So whenever I hear this question,\n\n2:09:50.780 --> 2:09:53.700\n I interpret it in a very specific way\n\n2:09:53.700 --> 2:09:57.300\n where it's not who was the most talented chess player\n\n2:09:57.300 --> 2:09:59.240\n or who had the most impact on the chess world,\n\n2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:02.860\n but who is the greatest at playing chess?\n\n2:10:02.860 --> 2:10:05.420\n Where if you were putting all of these players\n\n2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:07.960\n at their peak, who would be the best?\n\n2:10:07.960 --> 2:10:11.460\n And we're kind of living in a world\n\n2:10:11.460 --> 2:10:14.140\n where obviously humans are becoming more like cyborgs\n\n2:10:14.140 --> 2:10:17.220\n and their tools make them a lot more powerful.\n\n2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:21.460\n And the computer is the most powerful tool\n\n2:10:21.460 --> 2:10:23.500\n for chess that we've ever witnessed.\n\n2:10:23.500 --> 2:10:26.540\n And the top players now, someone like Magnus Carlsen\n\n2:10:26.540 --> 2:10:30.100\n or Gary Kasparov, if they were gonna go towards people\n\n2:10:30.100 --> 2:10:35.100\n like even Lasker or Bobby Fischer back in the day,\n\n2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:38.060\n Lasker, he was world champion for 27 years,\n\n2:10:38.060 --> 2:10:40.080\n he was the best in his field by far,\n\n2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:41.640\n but would he be able to stand up to someone\n\n2:10:41.640 --> 2:10:44.220\n like Magnus Carlsen who has had these tools?\n\n2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:45.580\n I don't think so.\n\n2:10:45.580 --> 2:10:49.680\n So most chess players have said Gary Kasparov\n\n2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:52.460\n and I think even Magnus has said that in the past,\n\n2:10:52.460 --> 2:10:55.320\n but I like to think of it as Magnus in his peak\n\n2:10:55.320 --> 2:10:57.600\n and Gary at his peak, and because Magnus was able\n\n2:10:57.600 --> 2:10:59.400\n to live more in a computer era,\n\n2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:02.560\n I feel like so far he's the greatest of all time.\n\n2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:04.000\n And some studies say things like\n\n2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:05.760\n how there's rating inflation,\n\n2:11:05.760 --> 2:11:06.960\n but I looked into some of them\n\n2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:11.400\n and they basically calculated people's play\n\n2:11:11.400 --> 2:11:13.240\n over the years and it seems\n\n2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:14.340\n that there hasn't been inflation,\n\n2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:15.360\n people are just getting better\n\n2:11:15.360 --> 2:11:18.320\n and I think it's because you have better tools at chess.\n\n2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:21.040\n And also one of the cases, what's your?\n\n2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:24.520\n I was gonna say, I actually, I disagree with that.\n\n2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:26.460\n Good, make it interesting.\n\n2:11:26.460 --> 2:11:31.460\n I think I would judge the greatest player of all time\n\n2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:33.680\n in relative to the time that they lived in\n\n2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:36.680\n and Magnus, although he is technically\n\n2:11:36.680 --> 2:11:38.440\n the strongest chess player in history,\n\n2:11:38.440 --> 2:11:41.960\n that is because he had computers to study chess with.\n\n2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:45.680\n And of course, if you compare him to like Gary Kasparov,\n\n2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:47.840\n he plays most like Stockfish,\n\n2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:49.680\n but Gary Kasparov at his time,\n\n2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:53.720\n he beat more players of his skill level than Magnus did.\n\n2:11:53.720 --> 2:11:55.320\n Magnus loses more often.\n\n2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:57.680\n He also of course held the belt for 20 years more.\n\n2:11:57.680 --> 2:12:01.120\n So I'd say actually, because Gary lacked the help\n\n2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:03.500\n of computers to study chess\n\n2:12:03.500 --> 2:12:06.580\n and overall performed better against players\n\n2:12:06.580 --> 2:12:09.280\n of his skill level, I think he would be number one.\n\n2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:10.340\n Nice.\n\n2:12:10.340 --> 2:12:13.280\n Yeah, but I mean, the case that people make for Magnus\n\n2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:16.360\n on many, I mean, what Alex said,\n\n2:12:16.360 --> 2:12:20.240\n but also Magnus plays a lot and he doesn't,\n\n2:12:21.080 --> 2:12:24.960\n he plays a lot blitz, bullet and like he puts,\n\n2:12:25.840 --> 2:12:29.520\n he gets drunk and like he's really putting himself out there\n\n2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:32.500\n and in all kinds of conditions and he's able to dominate\n\n2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:35.720\n and a lot of them, we get to see many of the like losses\n\n2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:37.020\n or blunders and all that kind of stuff\n\n2:12:37.020 --> 2:12:39.000\n because he just puts himself out there.\n\n2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:42.500\n And I think Kasparov was much more like.\n\n2:12:42.500 --> 2:12:44.160\n Never saw him play drunk, right?\n\n2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:47.100\n Yeah, and it's very focused on the world championship.\n\n2:12:47.100 --> 2:12:51.140\n It's very, very limited number of games\n\n2:12:51.140 --> 2:12:52.580\n and very focused on winning.\n\n2:12:52.580 --> 2:12:56.120\n And so there's some aspect to the versatility,\n\n2:12:56.120 --> 2:12:59.380\n the aggressive play, the fun, all of that,\n\n2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:01.800\n that I think you have to give credit to.\n\n2:13:01.800 --> 2:13:02.800\n Oh, 100%.\n\n2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:06.480\n In terms of just the scope,\n\n2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:10.760\n the scale of the variety of genius exhibited by Magnus.\n\n2:13:10.760 --> 2:13:12.300\n And he might not even be done yet.\n\n2:13:12.300 --> 2:13:14.680\n I don't know if he'll ever hit 2,900,\n\n2:13:14.680 --> 2:13:16.640\n but we can't judge yet\n\n2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:18.960\n because he's not at the peak of his career potentially.\n\n2:13:18.960 --> 2:13:20.920\n What do you think about him not playing world championship?\n\n2:13:20.920 --> 2:13:23.080\n Isn't that like, isn't that wild?\n\n2:13:23.080 --> 2:13:26.800\n The entirety of the history of chess in the 20th century\n\n2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:27.720\n going like meh.\n\n2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:31.720\n It's walking away from this one tournament\n\n2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:34.320\n that seems to be at the center of chess.\n\n2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:37.400\n What do you think about that decision?\n\n2:13:37.400 --> 2:13:41.440\n I mean, you can't help but be disappointed as a chess fan\n\n2:13:41.440 --> 2:13:43.560\n who wants to see the best player in the world\n\n2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:44.980\n defend his title.\n\n2:13:44.980 --> 2:13:48.720\n But I also understand it on a personal level\n\n2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:51.360\n and not feeling as satisfied\n\n2:13:51.360 --> 2:13:53.820\n when you're going to the world championship\n\n2:13:53.820 --> 2:13:55.740\n and having to defend against people\n\n2:13:55.740 --> 2:13:57.360\n who are less strong than you.\n\n2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:59.600\n And also imagine winning world championships\n\n2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:01.720\n and not feeling a joy out of that.\n\n2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:04.720\n So maybe by not doing that\n\n2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:07.200\n and focusing instead on a goal like 2,900,\n\n2:14:07.200 --> 2:14:09.200\n he'll be more likely to accomplish it\n\n2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:12.520\n because he's focusing on what actually motivates him\n\n2:14:12.520 --> 2:14:13.580\n to play chess.\n\n2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:17.760\n But I do think that it will hurt\n\n2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:20.520\n how we judge the next world champion.\n\n2:14:21.400 --> 2:14:23.960\n I think it won't change him being the best player\n\n2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:25.000\n in the world.\n\n2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:27.360\n And for someone to replace him,\n\n2:14:27.360 --> 2:14:29.940\n even let's say like Nepo versus Sting,\n\n2:14:29.940 --> 2:14:32.960\n even if one of them win and right on some stance,\n\n2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:34.600\n it does lower the merit\n\n2:14:34.600 --> 2:14:37.740\n because now who has the world chess championship title\n\n2:14:37.740 --> 2:14:39.640\n isn't actually the best player in the world.\n\n2:14:39.640 --> 2:14:41.720\n And that has happened before in the past,\n\n2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:45.480\n but still going to take the same effort to prove\n\n2:14:45.480 --> 2:14:48.120\n when they would pass him like 10, 20 years\n\n2:14:48.120 --> 2:14:49.520\n to become stronger than Magnus.\n\n2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:51.260\n So I don't think it changes the skill level\n\n2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:54.220\n that it takes to become the best chess player in the world.\n\n2:14:54.220 --> 2:14:56.760\n I think for chess fans, it's very disappointing,\n\n2:14:56.760 --> 2:14:58.700\n but I think in the overall like grand scheme\n\n2:14:58.700 --> 2:15:01.680\n of like the public view to people who don't really,\n\n2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:04.680\n so like, you know, what breaks the popular culture\n\n2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:08.280\n and you think of what names people know\n\n2:15:08.280 --> 2:15:10.620\n who don't play chess like Bobby Fischer did it.\n\n2:15:10.620 --> 2:15:12.320\n Most people know Casper over Magnus.\n\n2:15:12.320 --> 2:15:15.480\n It takes the same ability and talent and that doesn't change.\n\n2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:16.980\n I think it does change though\n\n2:15:16.980 --> 2:15:20.360\n if you're playing a player who's not as strong,\n\n2:15:20.360 --> 2:15:22.300\n but I see your point as well.\n\n2:15:22.300 --> 2:15:23.840\n And I know we differ on this.\n\n2:15:23.840 --> 2:15:25.240\n Like I said, I heard you ask Magnus,\n\n2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:26.600\n but what is your take on it?\n\n2:15:30.000 --> 2:15:33.920\n Well, listen, his answer is kind of brilliant,\n\n2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:37.440\n which he's not saying he's bored\n\n2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:39.040\n of the world championship.\n\n2:15:39.040 --> 2:15:41.680\n He's bored of a process\n\n2:15:41.680 --> 2:15:44.320\n that doesn't determine the best player.\n\n2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:47.120\n Like, and it's too exciting inducing to him\n\n2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:50.040\n to have a small number of games.\n\n2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:54.800\n He doesn't mind losing, which is really fascinating\n\n2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:58.600\n to a better player or somebody who is his level.\n\n2:15:58.600 --> 2:16:03.600\n He's more anxious about losing to a weaker player\n\n2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:07.160\n because of the small sample size.\n\n2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:09.840\n Now, if like poker players had that anxiety,\n\n2:16:09.840 --> 2:16:11.600\n they would never play at all, right?\n\n2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:13.360\n That's the World Series of Poker.\n\n2:16:13.360 --> 2:16:17.560\n You get to lose against weaker players all the time.\n\n2:16:17.560 --> 2:16:19.400\n That's the throw of the dice.\n\n2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:21.960\n But that's an interesting perspective\n\n2:16:21.960 --> 2:16:25.160\n that he would love to play 20, 30, 40 games\n\n2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:26.120\n in the world championship,\n\n2:16:26.120 --> 2:16:28.160\n and then he would enjoy it much more.\n\n2:16:28.160 --> 2:16:29.960\n And also play shorter games\n\n2:16:29.960 --> 2:16:34.600\n because they emphasize the like pure chess,\n\n2:16:34.600 --> 2:16:39.600\n actually being able to like much more variety\n\n2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:42.760\n in the middle game just to see a bunch of chaos\n\n2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:43.960\n and see how you're able to compute,\n\n2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:46.480\n calculate and intuition, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:16:46.480 --> 2:16:48.200\n I mean, that's beautiful.\n\n2:16:48.200 --> 2:16:51.600\n I wish the chess world would step up and meet him\n\n2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:53.360\n in a place that makes sense,\n\n2:16:55.280 --> 2:16:56.560\n change the world championship.\n\n2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:00.480\n So FIDE changing it somehow, a loss for that.\n\n2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:03.600\n Or having other really respected tournaments\n\n2:17:03.600 --> 2:17:06.480\n that become like an annual thing that step up to that.\n\n2:17:07.400 --> 2:17:12.120\n Or more kind of online YouTube type of competitions,\n\n2:17:12.120 --> 2:17:14.560\n which I think they're trying to do more and more,\n\n2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:16.440\n like the Crypto Cup and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:17:16.440 --> 2:17:19.240\n And the Grand Tour does play in,\n\n2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:21.120\n which takes a lot of the top players\n\n2:17:21.120 --> 2:17:23.760\n and they do it online in shorter formats.\n\n2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:26.280\n But there's, so that's his perspective.\n\n2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:30.320\n My perhaps narrow perspective\n\n2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:32.360\n is I romanticize the Olympic games\n\n2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:33.680\n and those are every four years\n\n2:17:33.680 --> 2:17:38.200\n and the world championships because they're rare,\n\n2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:40.440\n because the sample size is so small.\n\n2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:42.200\n That's where the magic happens.\n\n2:17:42.200 --> 2:17:45.760\n Everything's on the line for people\n\n2:17:45.760 --> 2:17:50.520\n that spend their whole life, 20 years of dedication,\n\n2:17:50.520 --> 2:17:52.800\n everything you have, every minute of the day\n\n2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:54.920\n spent for that moment.\n\n2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:57.560\n You think about like gymnastics at the Olympic games.\n\n2:17:57.560 --> 2:17:59.720\n There's certain sports where a single mistake\n\n2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:01.280\n and you're fucked.\n\n2:18:01.280 --> 2:18:06.280\n And that stress, that pressure, it can break people\n\n2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:11.160\n or it can create magic.\n\n2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:13.520\n Like a person that's the underdog\n\n2:18:13.520 --> 2:18:15.520\n has the best night of their life\n\n2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:18.200\n or the person that's been dominating for years\n\n2:18:18.200 --> 2:18:19.840\n all of a sudden slips up.\n\n2:18:19.840 --> 2:18:22.080\n That drama from a human perspective is beautiful.\n\n2:18:22.080 --> 2:18:24.560\n So I still like the world championships,\n\n2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:28.320\n but then again, looking at all the draws,\n\n2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:33.320\n looking at like, well, the magic isn't quite there.\n\n2:18:33.760 --> 2:18:36.440\n So to me, when I see faster games of chess,\n\n2:18:36.440 --> 2:18:39.360\n that's much more beautiful.\n\n2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:41.520\n But then I don't understand the game of chess\n\n2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:43.200\n deeply enough to know.\n\n2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:48.200\n Like, does it have to be so many draws?\n\n2:18:48.880 --> 2:18:51.440\n Like, is there a way to create a more dynamic chess?\n\n2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:53.800\n And he talked about random chess\n\n2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:55.400\n with a random starting position.\n\n2:18:55.400 --> 2:18:56.240\n That's really interesting.\n\n2:18:56.240 --> 2:18:58.440\n But then of course, that's like,\n\n2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:00.520\n then you do have to play hundreds of games\n\n2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:01.840\n and that kind of stuff.\n\n2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:07.280\n But I think it's great that the world number one\n\n2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:12.440\n is struggling with these questions\n\n2:19:12.440 --> 2:19:13.840\n because he's in the position,\n\n2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:16.800\n he has the leverage to actually change the game of chess\n\n2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:19.480\n as it's publicly seen, as it's publicly played.\n\n2:19:19.480 --> 2:19:21.960\n So it's interesting.\n\n2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:24.160\n He's still young enough to dominate\n\n2:19:24.160 --> 2:19:26.280\n for quite a long time if he wants.\n\n2:19:26.280 --> 2:19:27.280\n So I don't know.\n\n2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:32.120\n I, you know, with Kasparov, the fight between nations,\n\n2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:34.760\n I hope they have the world championship\n\n2:19:34.760 --> 2:19:38.560\n and I hope he's still a part of it somehow.\n\n2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:40.360\n I hope he changes his mind.\n\n2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:41.200\n And comes back.\n\n2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:42.040\n Comes back.\n\n2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:43.080\n Kind of dramatic thing.\n\n2:19:43.080 --> 2:19:44.680\n I don't know.\n\n2:19:44.680 --> 2:19:47.880\n But it is, his heart is not in it.\n\n2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:48.720\n And then,\n\n2:19:51.680 --> 2:19:54.520\n and then that's not beautiful to see, right?\n\n2:19:57.720 --> 2:20:02.000\n Yeah, it is beautiful that the thing he wants\n\n2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:04.440\n is a great game of chess against an opponent\n\n2:20:04.440 --> 2:20:06.160\n that's his level or better.\n\n2:20:07.200 --> 2:20:10.120\n And that's great that he's coming from that place.\n\n2:20:10.120 --> 2:20:11.920\n But I hope he comes back tomorrow.\n\n2:20:11.920 --> 2:20:15.400\n Because the world championship is a special thing\n\n2:20:15.400 --> 2:20:16.960\n in any sport.\n\n2:20:16.960 --> 2:20:18.560\n So you do wish that the person\n\n2:20:18.560 --> 2:20:20.040\n who wins the world championship\n\n2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:21.760\n is the best player in the world?\n\n2:20:23.640 --> 2:20:24.720\n No.\n\n2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:28.640\n I hope that the best people in the world,\n\n2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:30.120\n the two best people in the world\n\n2:20:30.120 --> 2:20:31.720\n are the ones that sit down.\n\n2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:35.840\n But the person that wins is the person that,\n\n2:20:35.840 --> 2:20:37.200\n that's the magic of it.\n\n2:20:37.200 --> 2:20:39.160\n Nobody knows who's going to win.\n\n2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:42.640\n I think Magnus is so, he really wants\n\n2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:44.120\n the best person to win.\n\n2:20:44.120 --> 2:20:48.480\n Like the, that's why he wants the large sample size.\n\n2:20:48.480 --> 2:20:50.440\n But to me there's some magic to it.\n\n2:20:50.440 --> 2:20:53.360\n The stress of it, the drama of it.\n\n2:20:53.360 --> 2:20:55.280\n That's all part of the game.\n\n2:20:55.280 --> 2:20:58.120\n Like it's not just about the purity of the game,\n\n2:20:58.120 --> 2:21:00.520\n like the calculation.\n\n2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:01.760\n The pure chess of it.\n\n2:21:01.760 --> 2:21:03.840\n It's also like the drama.\n\n2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:07.760\n Like the, yeah, the pressure, the drama, all of it.\n\n2:21:07.760 --> 2:21:10.760\n The shit talking, if it gets to you, the mind games.\n\n2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:12.560\n This is the part that's fun to watch,\n\n2:21:12.560 --> 2:21:14.480\n but less fun to be playing.\n\n2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:15.720\n But that's why it's great.\n\n2:21:15.720 --> 2:21:18.640\n Who can melt, who can rise under that pressure\n\n2:21:18.640 --> 2:21:20.280\n and who melts under that pressure.\n\n2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:24.160\n There's a lot of people that look up to you,\n\n2:21:24.160 --> 2:21:26.200\n like they're inspired by you\n\n2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:28.720\n because you've taken a kind of nonlinear path through life.\n\n2:21:28.720 --> 2:21:31.000\n Is there any advice you have for people\n\n2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:32.440\n like in high school today?\n\n2:21:33.800 --> 2:21:35.760\n They're trying to figure out what they want to do.\n\n2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:37.040\n Do they want to go to Stanford?\n\n2:21:37.040 --> 2:21:41.360\n Do they want to pursue a career in, I don't know,\n\n2:21:41.360 --> 2:21:46.000\n in industry or go kind of the path you guys have taken,\n\n2:21:46.000 --> 2:21:48.480\n which is have the ability to do all of that\n\n2:21:48.480 --> 2:21:50.680\n and still choose to make the thing\n\n2:21:50.680 --> 2:21:52.680\n that you're passionate about your life.\n\n2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:56.760\n I always liked the calculated risks approach\n\n2:21:56.760 --> 2:22:00.360\n where when you're younger, it's okay to take more risks\n\n2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:02.360\n because you have a lot more time,\n\n2:22:02.360 --> 2:22:04.040\n but there has to be a reason\n\n2:22:04.040 --> 2:22:06.120\n why you're doing that particular risk.\n\n2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:08.400\n Is it something that you've spent a lot of time already\n\n2:22:08.400 --> 2:22:09.880\n really passionate and working on\n\n2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:11.320\n or is it just something that's trendy\n\n2:22:11.320 --> 2:22:13.880\n and you want to do it because you don't have a better option?\n\n2:22:13.880 --> 2:22:16.360\n And that's actually similar to what Andrea did\n\n2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:19.520\n when she decided to go into streaming instead of school.\n\n2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:21.920\n Yeah, the reason I got into streaming\n\n2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:24.240\n because I was initially going to go to college,\n\n2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:25.440\n but the pandemics,\n\n2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:27.280\n it was right at the beginning of the pandemic\n\n2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:29.320\n and all my classes were online.\n\n2:22:29.320 --> 2:22:31.960\n And I never thought, ever since I was 12,\n\n2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:36.200\n like my dream was school and I saw myself nowhere else\n\n2:22:36.200 --> 2:22:37.960\n than going to university.\n\n2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:40.440\n And I thought of it and kind of weighed out the risks.\n\n2:22:40.440 --> 2:22:41.760\n I'm like, well, if I take a gap year\n\n2:22:41.760 --> 2:22:45.160\n and I try streaming with my sister, what do I have to lose?\n\n2:22:45.160 --> 2:22:47.400\n I gained some experience working with someone\n\n2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:49.880\n who has a lot more experience than I do.\n\n2:22:49.880 --> 2:22:52.360\n And then I can go back to school after.\n\n2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:54.000\n And if I go to school right now,\n\n2:22:54.000 --> 2:22:55.480\n I do online classes for a year\n\n2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:57.400\n and that's something that I could do at any time.\n\n2:22:57.400 --> 2:23:00.920\n So that's why it made a lot of sense for me to go into this.\n\n2:23:00.920 --> 2:23:04.240\n But of course, this is also a very unique opportunity.\n\n2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:05.560\n So I don't know how applicable,\n\n2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:07.680\n but I do think overall the calculated risk\n\n2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:08.560\n is a really good lesson.\n\n2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:10.360\n So life is like chess.\n\n2:23:10.360 --> 2:23:11.760\n Exactly.\n\n2:23:11.760 --> 2:23:12.840\n Maybe sometime.\n\n2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:13.840\n Exactly.\n\n2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:15.920\n You also, have you considered a career\n\n2:23:15.920 --> 2:23:16.840\n in professional fighting?\n\n2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:18.800\n I saw you did a self defense class,\n\n2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:20.280\n you did a little Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:23:20.280 --> 2:23:22.840\n Did you see the 10 year old kid who...\n\n2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:24.240\n Throwing her?\n\n2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:26.480\n Yes, and apparently I could have broken a leg.\n\n2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:29.360\n But it's actually funny, like chess boxing is a thing\n\n2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:32.280\n and I have been doing a lot of boxing.\n\n2:23:32.280 --> 2:23:34.160\n Physical activity is like, honestly,\n\n2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:35.960\n one of my favorite things to do.\n\n2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:38.240\n And I have been testing it out on content\n\n2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:40.000\n and we have a creator friend\n\n2:23:40.000 --> 2:23:42.040\n who's hosting a chess boxing tournament,\n\n2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:45.760\n but there's no woman who could match me, unfortunately,\n\n2:23:45.760 --> 2:23:47.680\n because all the opponents are male\n\n2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:50.120\n and I can't fight a guy.\n\n2:23:50.120 --> 2:23:51.680\n How does chess boxing work?\n\n2:23:51.680 --> 2:23:54.120\n So you do a round of chess and a round of boxing.\n\n2:23:54.120 --> 2:23:56.520\n And we actually did a training camp for it before.\n\n2:23:56.520 --> 2:23:59.400\n And of course, after you go into the ring.\n\n2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:00.240\n Is this real?\n\n2:24:00.240 --> 2:24:01.080\n Is this serious?\n\n2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:01.920\n Yes, it's amazing.\n\n2:24:01.920 --> 2:24:03.320\n We went to a London chess boxing club.\n\n2:24:03.320 --> 2:24:04.160\n And after you get...\n\n2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:05.120\n No, it seemed like videos,\n\n2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:06.680\n I thought it was something you'd just do in Russia\n\n2:24:06.680 --> 2:24:07.520\n or something.\n\n2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:08.360\n No, it's a real sport.\n\n2:24:08.360 --> 2:24:09.200\n It's a real sport.\n\n2:24:09.200 --> 2:24:10.440\n Yeah, no, it's very cool.\n\n2:24:10.440 --> 2:24:12.320\n But after you get really tired,\n\n2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:14.000\n you're more likely to make a mistake\n\n2:24:14.000 --> 2:24:16.040\n and they call them Jaffers or something.\n\n2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:17.360\n Yeah, there's probably good strategies,\n\n2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:19.360\n like what do you want to...\n\n2:24:19.360 --> 2:24:21.320\n Because some of it is a cardio thing.\n\n2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:23.760\n Do you want to work on your chess or your boxing?\n\n2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:25.560\n They do both, it's very fun.\n\n2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:27.120\n But yeah, from a content perspective,\n\n2:24:27.120 --> 2:24:31.960\n I'm sure there's a lot of people that would love to see.\n\n2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:33.800\n I don't want to see Andrea getting hit.\n\n2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:34.640\n That would be...\n\n2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:35.480\n I would love to fight.\n\n2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:37.760\n Unless she doesn't get hit.\n\n2:24:37.760 --> 2:24:39.640\n Our roommate fought in a fight\n\n2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:40.960\n and she did end up winning,\n\n2:24:40.960 --> 2:24:42.320\n but seeing her get hit,\n\n2:24:42.320 --> 2:24:43.840\n I thought I was going to throw up off screen.\n\n2:24:43.840 --> 2:24:44.920\n I just think it was so cool.\n\n2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:47.120\n She had no experience in boxing whatsoever.\n\n2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:49.520\n And then coming from someone in the content world,\n\n2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:52.120\n where you start waking up six days a week at 6 a.m.\n\n2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:54.120\n and she's training every day,\n\n2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:55.840\n like a real professional athlete,\n\n2:24:55.840 --> 2:24:58.240\n I think like it's such a unique experience\n\n2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:00.000\n and also like a really test\n\n2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:02.880\n of how much you can really commit to this and progress.\n\n2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:05.120\n And I think that's really rewarding.\n\n2:25:05.120 --> 2:25:08.320\n Did you ever end up doing the marathon with David Goggins\n\n2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:09.160\n that you were training for?\n\n2:25:09.160 --> 2:25:11.840\n No, I got injured, but we're going to do it soon.\n\n2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:14.080\n That's on my bucket list,\n\n2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:15.560\n just to see what your limits are.\n\n2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:16.400\n You're ready to do it?\n\n2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:18.200\n What did you do leading up to this?\n\n2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:19.840\n Nothing.\n\n2:25:19.840 --> 2:25:20.680\n You're just going to go into it.\n\n2:25:20.680 --> 2:25:22.240\n It's mental anyway.\n\n2:25:22.240 --> 2:25:23.080\n Oh, you don't...\n\n2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:25.240\n I run a lot to make sure like there's no...\n\n2:25:27.520 --> 2:25:29.920\n You have to have a base level of fitness\n\n2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:32.240\n to make sure your body doesn't completely freak out.\n\n2:25:32.240 --> 2:25:36.200\n But other than that, 50 plus miles is just about\n\n2:25:36.200 --> 2:25:39.440\n like taking it one step at a time\n\n2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:42.160\n and just being able to deal with the suffering\n\n2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:43.720\n and all the voices, the little voices\n\n2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:44.880\n that tell you all the excuses,\n\n2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:47.320\n like why are you doing this?\n\n2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:49.680\n This blister is bleeding, whatever.\n\n2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:53.360\n Whatever the thing that makes you want to stop,\n\n2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:54.200\n just shut it off.\n\n2:25:54.200 --> 2:25:56.880\n Sometimes it feels like you like pain.\n\n2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:00.120\n No, well, no, no.\n\n2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:05.120\n But the pain does seem to show the way to progress.\n\n2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:06.280\n So what...\n\n2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:08.040\n In your turn of life.\n\n2:26:08.040 --> 2:26:08.880\n In my world.\n\n2:26:08.880 --> 2:26:11.600\n Something that's really hard and I don't want to do,\n\n2:26:11.600 --> 2:26:14.080\n that's usually the right thing to do.\n\n2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:17.960\n And I'm not saying that's like a universal truth.\n\n2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:22.040\n It's just, if there's a few doors to go into,\n\n2:26:22.040 --> 2:26:24.320\n the one that I want to go into least,\n\n2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:27.320\n that's the one that usually is the right one.\n\n2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:29.880\n Afterwards, I will learn something from it.\n\n2:26:29.880 --> 2:26:31.880\n The David Goggins thing, I don't know.\n\n2:26:31.880 --> 2:26:34.640\n Listen, we're talking offline,\n\n2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:36.000\n the conversation with Liv,\n\n2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:38.680\n she has a very numeric, calculated risk.\n\n2:26:38.680 --> 2:26:39.720\n Everything is planned.\n\n2:26:39.720 --> 2:26:41.240\n I go with the heart.\n\n2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:42.880\n I just go whatever the hell.\n\n2:26:42.880 --> 2:26:44.840\n I think two years ago, I woke up,\n\n2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:49.840\n it was summer, I decided to tweet,\n\n2:26:50.400 --> 2:26:53.320\n I will do as many pushups.\n\n2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.600\n I don't know why I did this,\n\n2:26:55.600 --> 2:26:58.240\n but I will do as many pushups and pull ups\n\n2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:00.400\n as this week gets likes, something like that.\n\n2:27:00.400 --> 2:27:01.240\n Okay.\n\n2:27:01.240 --> 2:27:02.080\n Right?\n\n2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:05.840\n And then that it got like 30,000.\n\n2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:08.360\n Once you put it out on the internet,\n\n2:27:08.360 --> 2:27:09.200\n you're held accountable.\n\n2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:11.560\n Well, for myself, I mean, in some sense.\n\n2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:14.920\n And then that's when, I already was connected to David\n\n2:27:14.920 --> 2:27:17.000\n at that point, but that's when he called me.\n\n2:27:18.040 --> 2:27:19.800\n And then didn't have to do it.\n\n2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:21.680\n And then I did it and it was one of the hardest things\n\n2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:22.520\n I've ever done.\n\n2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:23.360\n How long did you take?\n\n2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:25.960\n I did it for seven days and I got injured.\n\n2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:27.680\n So I did about a few thousand.\n\n2:27:27.680 --> 2:27:29.840\n Wait, so this is what got you to be injured?\n\n2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:30.920\n This challenge?\n\n2:27:30.920 --> 2:27:31.760\n No, it's different.\n\n2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:34.320\n I keep getting injured doing stuff.\n\n2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:36.560\n But this particular thing, I started doing the,\n\n2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:39.080\n you don't realize that you have to really ramp up.\n\n2:27:39.080 --> 2:27:44.080\n So I got like overuse injury tendonitis on the shoulder\n\n2:27:44.480 --> 2:27:46.000\n all the way down to the elbow.\n\n2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:49.880\n So I took like eight or nine days off\n\n2:27:49.880 --> 2:27:51.080\n and then started again.\n\n2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:55.720\n And then it took about 31 days to do.\n\n2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:57.280\n 30,000.\n\n2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:01.560\n The number was like 26, 27,000.\n\n2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:02.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:03.240\n Wow.\n\n2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:06.200\n And it took like three, four hours a day.\n\n2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:07.160\n Oh God.\n\n2:28:07.160 --> 2:28:08.000\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:08.880\n Sounds like torture.\n\n2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:11.440\n And not, you know, constantly asking myself,\n\n2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:13.120\n what am I doing with my life?\n\n2:28:13.120 --> 2:28:16.600\n This is why you're single, was the voice in my head.\n\n2:28:16.600 --> 2:28:18.160\n This is what are you doing?\n\n2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:19.800\n It's like face down on the carpet.\n\n2:28:21.600 --> 2:28:23.040\n Like exhausted.\n\n2:28:23.040 --> 2:28:24.640\n Like what, what?\n\n2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:25.680\n Because of a tweet?\n\n2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:26.840\n What is this?\n\n2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:28.440\n Did you record it or you just?\n\n2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:29.280\n I did.\n\n2:28:29.280 --> 2:28:30.320\n I did record it for myself.\n\n2:28:30.320 --> 2:28:31.160\n Okay.\n\n2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:32.880\n Now imagine doing this every day\n\n2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.880\n and that's what it's like to be a Twitch streamer.\n\n2:28:34.880 --> 2:28:35.720\n Just kidding.\n\n2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:36.540\n Right.\n\n2:28:36.540 --> 2:28:37.380\n I'm doing stupid things.\n\n2:28:37.380 --> 2:28:39.240\n That was really important to me actually\n\n2:28:39.240 --> 2:28:41.120\n to not make it into content.\n\n2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:43.320\n You know, I recorded everything.\n\n2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:44.960\n So maybe one day I could publish it.\n\n2:28:44.960 --> 2:28:48.360\n I recorded it mostly because it's really hard to count.\n\n2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:49.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:50.440\n When you get exhausted.\n\n2:28:50.440 --> 2:28:51.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:54.640\n Like I just, so you actually enter the Zen place\n\n2:28:54.640 --> 2:28:58.120\n where with pushups, where it's just like,\n\n2:28:58.120 --> 2:28:59.720\n it's almost like breathing.\n\n2:28:59.720 --> 2:29:02.600\n You get into a rhythm and you can do quite a lot.\n\n2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.120\n But I wanted to make sure like,\n\n2:29:04.120 --> 2:29:07.920\n if I actually get this done, I want there to be evidence\n\n2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:10.520\n that I got it done for myself so I can count it.\n\n2:29:10.520 --> 2:29:12.240\n I had this idea that I would use machine learning\n\n2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:15.120\n to like automatically process the video to count it.\n\n2:29:15.120 --> 2:29:17.560\n But then like, after like 10 days,\n\n2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:19.060\n I didn't even give a shit what anyone thought.\n\n2:29:19.060 --> 2:29:21.240\n It was about me versus me.\n\n2:29:21.240 --> 2:29:22.080\n I didn't even care.\n\n2:29:22.080 --> 2:29:23.360\n Lex versus Lex.\n\n2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:24.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:24.200 --> 2:29:26.000\n And then, yeah.\n\n2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:27.560\n And David was extremely supportive.\n\n2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:28.560\n But that's when I realized like,\n\n2:29:28.560 --> 2:29:31.200\n I really want to go head to head with him.\n\n2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:34.720\n So yeah, those kinds of people are beautiful.\n\n2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:36.020\n They really challenge you to your limits.\n\n2:29:36.020 --> 2:29:37.120\n Whatever that is.\n\n2:29:37.120 --> 2:29:40.080\n It's like, the thing is physical exercise\n\n2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:42.800\n is such an easy way to push yourself to your limit.\n\n2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:44.600\n There's in all other walks of life,\n\n2:29:44.600 --> 2:29:46.400\n it's trickier to configure.\n\n2:29:46.400 --> 2:29:48.760\n Like how do you push yourself to your limits in chess?\n\n2:29:48.760 --> 2:29:50.440\n It's hard to figure out.\n\n2:29:50.440 --> 2:29:51.280\n But like in physical.\n\n2:29:51.280 --> 2:29:53.180\n Do you think it's ever dangerous?\n\n2:29:53.180 --> 2:29:54.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:29:54.020 --> 2:29:56.120\n And that's why it's beautiful.\n\n2:29:56.120 --> 2:29:56.940\n The danger.\n\n2:29:56.940 --> 2:29:57.780\n She likes the pain.\n\n2:29:57.780 --> 2:30:00.040\n I don't like that your eyes lit up as I said.\n\n2:30:00.040 --> 2:30:01.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:04.800\n Like if you don't know how you're gonna get out of it,\n\n2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:07.240\n you're gonna have to figure out something profound\n\n2:30:08.240 --> 2:30:09.200\n about yourself.\n\n2:30:10.480 --> 2:30:13.060\n And I mean, one of the reasons I went to Ukraine\n\n2:30:13.060 --> 2:30:18.060\n is I really wanted to experience the hardship\n\n2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:23.960\n and the intensity of war that people are experiencing\n\n2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:25.960\n so I can understand myself better,\n\n2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:27.440\n I can understand them better.\n\n2:30:27.440 --> 2:30:30.720\n So the words that are leaving my mouth are grounded\n\n2:30:30.720 --> 2:30:32.400\n in a better understanding of who they are.\n\n2:30:32.400 --> 2:30:36.080\n And I mean, the running a lot with David Gong\n\n2:30:36.080 --> 2:30:39.360\n is it's a much simpler thing to do.\n\n2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:42.400\n Simpler way to understand something about yourself,\n\n2:30:42.400 --> 2:30:44.440\n about like the limits of human nature.\n\n2:30:44.440 --> 2:30:47.760\n I think most growth happens with voluntary suffering\n\n2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:50.240\n or struggle, involuntary stuff.\n\n2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:52.680\n That's where the dark trauma is created.\n\n2:30:52.680 --> 2:30:55.840\n But I don't know, maybe it is.\n\n2:30:55.840 --> 2:30:57.520\n Maybe I'm just attracted to torture.\n\n2:30:57.520 --> 2:30:59.520\n And what is it that your mind does\n\n2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:02.120\n when you're going through this involuntary suffering?\n\n2:31:03.240 --> 2:31:04.080\n I think,\n\n2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:15.880\n there's like stages.\n\n2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:17.760\n First, all the excuses start coming.\n\n2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:20.360\n Like why are you doing this?\n\n2:31:20.360 --> 2:31:25.320\n And then you start to wonder like what kind of person\n\n2:31:25.320 --> 2:31:26.920\n do you want to be?\n\n2:31:26.920 --> 2:31:28.400\n So all the dreams you had,\n\n2:31:28.400 --> 2:31:30.440\n all the promises you made to yourself and to others,\n\n2:31:30.440 --> 2:31:34.520\n all the ambitions you had that haven't come yet realized,\n\n2:31:34.520 --> 2:31:39.080\n somehow that all becomes really intensely like visceral\n\n2:31:39.080 --> 2:31:41.520\n as the struggle is happening.\n\n2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:46.520\n And then when all of that is allowed to pass from your mind,\n\n2:31:47.680 --> 2:31:49.280\n you have this clear appreciation\n\n2:31:49.280 --> 2:31:50.800\n of what you really love in life,\n\n2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:53.040\n which is just like just living.\n\n2:31:53.040 --> 2:31:57.320\n Just the moment, the step at a time.\n\n2:31:57.320 --> 2:32:00.040\n I think what meditation does and it's most effective,\n\n2:32:00.040 --> 2:32:02.480\n it's just that pain is a catalyst\n\n2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:05.040\n for the meditative process, I think.\n\n2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:07.200\n For me, for me.\n\n2:32:07.200 --> 2:32:08.040\n I don't know.\n\n2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:10.680\n Magnus said there's no meaning to life.\n\n2:32:10.680 --> 2:32:14.360\n Do you guys agree or no?\n\n2:32:14.360 --> 2:32:15.480\n Why are we here?\n\n2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:20.520\n I do not know why we're here,\n\n2:32:20.520 --> 2:32:25.520\n but I do know that having some kind of meaning\n\n2:32:26.600 --> 2:32:28.520\n that I give my own life\n\n2:32:28.520 --> 2:32:32.000\n makes it a lot more motivating every day.\n\n2:32:32.000 --> 2:32:34.960\n So I just try to focus on finding meaning within my own life\n\n2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:37.400\n even if I know it's just self imposed.\n\n2:32:38.680 --> 2:32:40.720\n And then chess is a part of that?\n\n2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:44.880\n Chess is a part of it.\n\n2:32:44.880 --> 2:32:47.800\n Maybe it was more so when I was younger\n\n2:32:47.800 --> 2:32:50.960\n because it was easier to just feel like I wanna improve\n\n2:32:50.960 --> 2:32:54.200\n as a person and to use chess\n\n2:32:54.200 --> 2:32:57.240\n to kind of measure some kind of self improvement.\n\n2:32:57.240 --> 2:33:00.480\n And now it's more different than that.\n\n2:33:00.480 --> 2:33:02.840\n And I think I need to once again find\n\n2:33:02.840 --> 2:33:06.960\n what that northern star is.\n\n2:33:06.960 --> 2:33:09.760\n Basically, I need to have a why for why I'm doing things.\n\n2:33:09.760 --> 2:33:12.240\n And then I feel like I could do very hard things.\n\n2:33:12.240 --> 2:33:17.240\n What role does love play in the human condition?\n\n2:33:18.760 --> 2:33:20.280\n Alex and Andrea.\n\n2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:23.120\n I'll let Andrea start this one since I took the last.\n\n2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:23.960\n Sure.\n\n2:33:23.960 --> 2:33:26.800\n And yeah, just to add my answer for the last one.\n\n2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:30.720\n I also kind of think, well, life is meaningless,\n\n2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:32.800\n but I like the stoic idea where that's something\n\n2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:35.240\n that you live to revolt against.\n\n2:33:35.240 --> 2:33:37.440\n But for the second question.\n\n2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:41.640\n The revolt against the fundamental meaninglessness of life.\n\n2:33:41.640 --> 2:33:43.240\n I like it. Exactly.\n\n2:33:43.240 --> 2:33:44.240\n Yeah.\n\n2:33:44.240 --> 2:33:45.760\n It was what does love play?\n\n2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:47.080\n What role does love play?\n\n2:33:47.080 --> 2:33:48.560\n Yeah, in the human condition.\n\n2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:51.200\n The way I see it,\n\n2:33:54.000 --> 2:33:57.360\n love is a reason you want to share experiences\n\n2:33:57.360 --> 2:33:59.160\n with other people.\n\n2:33:59.160 --> 2:34:00.000\n That's how I see it.\n\n2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:01.280\n Like the people you really love,\n\n2:34:01.280 --> 2:34:04.120\n you wanna share the things you're going through with them.\n\n2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:06.480\n The good and the bad.\n\n2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:08.000\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:34:08.000 --> 2:34:12.040\n That's my simple take on love.\n\n2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:16.760\n My take on it is that part of what it is to be human\n\n2:34:16.760 --> 2:34:20.560\n is to be somebody who feels things emotionally\n\n2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:25.200\n and love is one of the most intense feelings you can have.\n\n2:34:26.360 --> 2:34:28.440\n Obviously there's the opposite of that\n\n2:34:28.440 --> 2:34:30.000\n and there's things like hate,\n\n2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.160\n but I think the love you feel for people like your parents\n\n2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:35.720\n and your friends and romantic love in that moment\n\n2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:40.080\n is much more intense than in other situations.\n\n2:34:41.360 --> 2:34:44.480\n And I think it's also just very unique to humans\n\n2:34:44.480 --> 2:34:46.920\n and that's what I appreciate about it.\n\n2:34:46.920 --> 2:34:49.400\n Maybe that's the meaning of life.\n\n2:34:49.400 --> 2:34:52.240\n Maybe that's what the Stoics are searching for.\n\n2:34:52.240 --> 2:34:54.600\n Andrea, Alex, thank you so much for this\n\n2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:56.680\n and thank you for an amazing conversation.\n\n2:34:56.680 --> 2:34:58.680\n Thank you for creating, keep creating\n\n2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:01.120\n and thank you for putting knowledge\n\n2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:02.920\n and love out there in the world.\n\n2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:04.520\n Thank you for having us, Lex.\n\n2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:05.760\n It was a pleasure.\n\n2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:08.440\n And we're both big fans of your podcast,\n\n2:35:08.440 --> 2:35:10.280\n so this was really exciting for us.\n\n2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:12.640\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:15.000\n with Alexandra and Andrea Botez.\n\n2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:16.200\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:18.840\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:21.800\n And now let me leave you with some words from Bobby Fisher.\n\n2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:24.640\n Chess is life.\n\n2:35:24.640 --> 2:35:36.960\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
