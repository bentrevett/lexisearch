legendary investor,\n\n00:06.920 --> 00:09.120\n founder of Bridgewater Associates,\n\n00:09.120 --> 00:12.440\n author of a book I highly recommend called Principles,\n\n00:12.440 --> 00:16.000\n and also a new book called Principles for Dealing\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:17.840\n with a Changing World Order,\n\n00:17.840 --> 00:20.480\n that looks at the geopolitics of today,\n\n00:20.480 --> 00:24.580\n especially US and China, through the lens of history,\n\n00:24.580 --> 00:26.120\n providing a fascinating model\n\n00:26.120 --> 00:28.200\n for the rise and fall of empires\n\n00:28.200 --> 00:31.300\n that can be applied to the analysis of our world today.\n\n00:32.160 --> 00:34.300\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:34.300 --> 00:36.360\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:36.360 --> 00:37.520\n in the description.\n\n00:37.520 --> 00:42.040\n And now, here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.\n\n00:42.040 --> 00:44.200\n When you look at the history of the world,\n\n00:44.200 --> 00:45.880\n as you have done in your new book,\n\n00:45.880 --> 00:49.760\n Principles of Dealing with a Changing World Order,\n\n00:49.760 --> 00:53.280\n what is more important, more impactful, money or power?\n\n00:54.360 --> 00:56.480\n They go hand in hand.\n\n00:56.480 --> 01:01.120\n They support each other and they compete with each other.\n\n01:01.120 --> 01:05.380\n Those who have money have power, a certain type of power.\n\n01:06.380 --> 01:09.600\n That power has to do with all that they can buy,\n\n01:09.600 --> 01:12.560\n but it also has the ability\n\n01:12.560 --> 01:15.400\n to influence those with political power.\n\n01:17.920 --> 01:20.260\n And so you see this throughout history,\n\n01:20.260 --> 01:22.640\n this symbiotic relationship.\n\n01:22.640 --> 01:27.640\n You know, for example, between the royal families,\n\n01:29.680 --> 01:33.400\n the nobility, and the church.\n\n01:33.400 --> 01:36.160\n So you see that group of people\n\n01:36.160 --> 01:39.080\n supporting each other in various ways,\n\n01:39.080 --> 01:42.480\n and then wrestling around with each other\n\n01:42.480 --> 01:45.880\n for the money and power among that group.\n\n01:45.880 --> 01:48.640\n So the dynamic that's quite classic\n\n01:48.640 --> 01:52.860\n is you could look at the parties in power\n\n01:52.860 --> 01:57.800\n back in the 16th, 17th centuries.\n\n01:57.800 --> 02:01.680\n You would look at royal families, nobles,\n\n02:01.680 --> 02:05.600\n and the church, if you're in Europe,\n\n02:05.600 --> 02:10.080\n and then you would look at agricultural land,\n\n02:10.080 --> 02:12.280\n and there was a certain dynamic.\n\n02:12.280 --> 02:15.140\n And that varies over time, it changes,\n\n02:15.140 --> 02:20.140\n as those people get thrown out and technology changes.\n\n02:20.460 --> 02:24.100\n So when we evolved, when the society evolved,\n\n02:24.100 --> 02:28.020\n so that it would produce goods and services,\n\n02:28.020 --> 02:31.920\n and you have something like the Industrial Revolution,\n\n02:31.920 --> 02:35.140\n the first Industrial Revolution, you have machines,\n\n02:35.140 --> 02:38.980\n and you have the talent of people that are off the farms,\n\n02:40.020 --> 02:43.400\n and then you have a struggling for power.\n\n02:43.400 --> 02:47.500\n You see that power mix change.\n\n02:47.500 --> 02:50.860\n And so we don't see that same power mix anymore,\n\n02:50.860 --> 02:53.900\n but you still see the same dynamic.\n\n02:53.900 --> 02:55.680\n You see those with money,\n\n02:56.700 --> 03:00.560\n dealing with those who have political power\n\n03:00.560 --> 03:04.660\n around those assets that are considered most valuable\n\n03:04.660 --> 03:09.320\n to particularly the productive assets that produce money.\n\n03:09.320 --> 03:14.060\n And political power is usually centered around nation state,\n\n03:14.060 --> 03:17.860\n so the major locus of power is the nations.\n\n03:17.860 --> 03:22.860\n Yes, in 1668, after 30 years of war,\n\n03:25.140 --> 03:29.900\n there was the development of nation states.\n\n03:29.900 --> 03:34.620\n Before then, it was really the development of countries\n\n03:34.620 --> 03:37.500\n as we know it, that there were borders,\n\n03:37.500 --> 03:40.440\n and that within those borders,\n\n03:40.440 --> 03:43.940\n those who had control got to control it,\n\n03:43.940 --> 03:48.100\n and there were not to be intrusions in those borders,\n\n03:48.100 --> 03:51.540\n and that's how we established the nation state.\n\n03:51.540 --> 03:56.440\n And then, of course, within each country, there is levels.\n\n03:56.440 --> 03:59.660\n There is a central level,\n\n03:59.660 --> 04:02.700\n and then there is typically a province\n\n04:02.700 --> 04:05.360\n or state level down below,\n\n04:05.360 --> 04:06.980\n and then there's a municipal level,\n\n04:06.980 --> 04:10.700\n so they each have different levels of power,\n\n04:10.700 --> 04:14.460\n and it's the coordination of those\n\n04:14.460 --> 04:17.940\n that determines how the country is run.\n\n04:19.260 --> 04:23.340\n You write that the, quote, archetypal big cycle\n\n04:23.340 --> 04:25.880\n governs the rising and declining empires\n\n04:25.880 --> 04:27.900\n and influences everything about them,\n\n04:27.900 --> 04:30.380\n including their currencies and markets.\n\n04:30.380 --> 04:31.800\n The most important three cycles\n\n04:31.800 --> 04:35.100\n are the ones you mention in the introduction,\n\n04:35.100 --> 04:38.220\n the long term debt and capital market cycle,\n\n04:38.220 --> 04:40.540\n the internal order and disorder cycle,\n\n04:40.540 --> 04:44.660\n and the external order and disorder cycle.\n\n04:44.660 --> 04:47.440\n Can you describe this big cycle?\n\n04:48.380 --> 04:49.680\n There are two orders.\n\n04:50.660 --> 04:55.340\n There is an order, by order I mean a system,\n\n04:55.340 --> 04:56.900\n how the system works.\n\n04:58.180 --> 05:01.620\n So there's an internal order,\n\n05:01.620 --> 05:04.120\n that is the internal governance system,\n\n05:04.120 --> 05:06.740\n and it's usually set out in a constitution\n\n05:06.740 --> 05:11.420\n or some agreements, and then there's the world order,\n\n05:11.420 --> 05:12.720\n how the world system.\n\n05:12.720 --> 05:17.720\n So for example, in 1945, at the end of a war,\n\n05:18.420 --> 05:22.300\n which is basically a fight for determining the world order,\n\n05:23.340 --> 05:27.620\n the winners of the fight got together\n\n05:27.620 --> 05:32.460\n and created the world system as we now know it.\n\n05:32.460 --> 05:35.940\n In 1944, they created the Bretton Woods Monetary System\n\n05:35.940 --> 05:38.620\n that determined the money, pretty much,\n\n05:38.620 --> 05:41.440\n and because the United States won\n\n05:41.440 --> 05:44.140\n and had 80% of the world's money,\n\n05:44.140 --> 05:47.180\n gold was money then, and it had 80% of the world's gold,\n\n05:47.180 --> 05:48.780\n and it was half the world's economy,\n\n05:48.780 --> 05:51.500\n and it was the great military power,\n\n05:51.500 --> 05:55.280\n the order was built around an American world order,\n\n05:55.280 --> 05:58.460\n so that the United Nations was in New York,\n\n05:58.460 --> 06:00.940\n the World Bank and the IMF were in Washington,\n\n06:00.940 --> 06:02.740\n and they built that new order.\n\n06:02.740 --> 06:05.580\n So classically, you have a war\n\n06:05.580 --> 06:08.660\n to determine whose rules we're following,\n\n06:08.660 --> 06:13.380\n and then you have the new order being constructed.\n\n06:13.380 --> 06:16.220\n After that, there is usually period\n\n06:16.220 --> 06:20.760\n of extended peace and prosperity.\n\n06:20.760 --> 06:25.420\n Peace suits prosperity, and so there's not,\n\n06:25.420 --> 06:27.020\n and the reason you have the peace\n\n06:27.020 --> 06:31.820\n is because no one wants to fight with the dominant power.\n\n06:31.820 --> 06:34.100\n You know you're gonna lose, you've surrendered.\n\n06:34.100 --> 06:35.340\n There's been the surrendering.\n\n06:35.340 --> 06:36.580\n They carve up the world,\n\n06:36.580 --> 06:38.460\n they say what it's gonna look like,\n\n06:38.460 --> 06:40.140\n who's gonna control what,\n\n06:40.140 --> 06:44.700\n and then you come into that period of peace,\n\n06:44.700 --> 06:49.700\n and then prosperity, where then there's a working together.\n\n06:50.820 --> 06:55.820\n Usually, at that point, you've wiped out a lot of the debt,\n\n06:55.820 --> 06:59.600\n you've wiped out a lot of the issues,\n\n06:59.600 --> 07:01.960\n the class warfare and so on,\n\n07:01.960 --> 07:03.720\n and then there's good working together.\n\n07:03.720 --> 07:06.560\n So those great periods,\n\n07:06.560 --> 07:11.560\n such as the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s,\n\n07:12.560 --> 07:15.920\n or what we've experienced in the post World War II period,\n\n07:15.920 --> 07:19.240\n are peaceful and prosperous periods\n\n07:19.240 --> 07:22.520\n led largely by the dominant world power.\n\n07:22.520 --> 07:27.520\n Over a period of time, since really 1500,\n\n07:28.200 --> 07:31.800\n and maybe before, but really 1500,\n\n07:31.800 --> 07:35.840\n when the Dutch invented capitalism,\n\n07:35.840 --> 07:37.040\n and what I mean by that,\n\n07:37.040 --> 07:39.640\n they invented the first capital markets,\n\n07:39.640 --> 07:42.580\n the first stocks and the first stock market,\n\n07:43.580 --> 07:47.440\n that since then, capitalism has been an effective tool\n\n07:47.440 --> 07:50.800\n for building wealth because it got resources\n\n07:50.800 --> 07:54.000\n into the hands of inventive people.\n\n07:54.000 --> 07:56.540\n That's when we moved from agriculture\n\n07:56.540 --> 07:58.840\n to the importance of inventiveness of people,\n\n07:58.840 --> 08:03.500\n they got resources, and then they built that prosperity.\n\n08:03.500 --> 08:06.020\n In that process of doing that,\n\n08:06.020 --> 08:09.060\n they create wealth gaps, naturally.\n\n08:09.060 --> 08:13.200\n Those who make a lot of money make a lot more\n\n08:13.200 --> 08:15.020\n than those that don't,\n\n08:16.000 --> 08:20.200\n and it also produces opportunity gaps\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:22.920\n because, for example,\n\n08:22.920 --> 08:26.480\n those who earn a lot of money have that wealth,\n\n08:26.480 --> 08:29.320\n they have the power to educate their children\n\n08:29.320 --> 08:34.320\n in a way that others don't, and the gaps grow.\n\n08:34.860 --> 08:38.520\n And also, the debts grow at that time.\n\n08:38.520 --> 08:43.520\n When they go around the world with their competitiveness,\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:46.040\n they earn a lot of money.\n\n08:46.040 --> 08:49.020\n So for example, the Dutch, the Dutch Empire,\n\n08:49.020 --> 08:54.020\n learned how to build ships that would go around the world.\n\n08:54.200 --> 08:58.000\n A key ingredient of this improvement in this cycle\n\n08:58.000 --> 09:00.560\n is the improvement of education,\n\n09:00.560 --> 09:04.280\n and by education I mean the skills that come from education,\n\n09:04.280 --> 09:08.680\n but also civility, the ability to deal well together.\n\n09:08.680 --> 09:12.380\n So the Dutch invented ships that could go around the world\n\n09:12.380 --> 09:13.720\n and they had military power,\n\n09:13.720 --> 09:16.400\n but they were also a very inventive society.\n\n09:16.400 --> 09:21.280\n 25% of the world's new inventions came from the Dutch,\n\n09:21.280 --> 09:23.720\n and so as they went around the world,\n\n09:23.720 --> 09:26.200\n they also brought their currency,\n\n09:26.200 --> 09:28.220\n and they brought their military.\n\n09:28.220 --> 09:31.640\n They needed the currency, they paid for things,\n\n09:31.640 --> 09:34.620\n and that currency, and then the more that happens,\n\n09:34.620 --> 09:37.960\n the more that becomes a reserve currency,\n\n09:37.960 --> 09:40.140\n and then they have their military,\n\n09:40.140 --> 09:42.000\n so they need their military strength,\n\n09:42.000 --> 09:45.920\n and so you see it evolve in all of those ways.\n\n09:45.920 --> 09:48.000\n But over a period of time,\n\n09:48.880 --> 09:53.000\n as they become more successful and more expensive,\n\n09:53.000 --> 09:55.200\n they become more expensive,\n\n09:57.240 --> 09:59.900\n and newer countries come along,\n\n09:59.900 --> 10:04.900\n like the UK, then learn to build ships from a lot the Dutch\n\n10:07.760 --> 10:10.440\n and could do that less expensively,\n\n10:10.440 --> 10:14.400\n and also when they become more expensive,\n\n10:14.400 --> 10:16.120\n so less competitive,\n\n10:16.120 --> 10:19.080\n and also the work ethic begins to change.\n\n10:19.080 --> 10:20.680\n They believe that since they're richer,\n\n10:20.680 --> 10:22.640\n they can enjoy life more.\n\n10:22.640 --> 10:25.260\n They don't have to work quite as hard,\n\n10:25.260 --> 10:28.040\n and so you start to see the tilt.\n\n10:28.040 --> 10:31.160\n Now you start to see the development of the top,\n\n10:31.160 --> 10:34.360\n and when you have a world reserve currency,\n\n10:34.360 --> 10:37.000\n that allows you to borrow a lot of money\n\n10:37.000 --> 10:41.920\n because those who want to save want to hold your money,\n\n10:41.920 --> 10:44.080\n and that means that they'll lend you money,\n\n10:44.080 --> 10:47.120\n and so those countries get deeper into debt.\n\n10:47.120 --> 10:51.360\n So you see that they gradually lose their competitiveness,\n\n10:51.360 --> 10:56.280\n and they get themselves into financial circumstances,\n\n10:56.280 --> 10:58.700\n which are not good,\n\n10:58.700 --> 11:01.460\n and they have large wealth gaps,\n\n11:01.460 --> 11:04.640\n which set the stage for downturns.\n\n11:04.640 --> 11:06.680\n And when they have downturns,\n\n11:07.560 --> 11:10.120\n the first question is do they have enough money?\n\n11:10.120 --> 11:15.120\n And traditionally, money is resources.\n\n11:15.640 --> 11:20.000\n So you classically see that the coffers are bare,\n\n11:20.000 --> 11:25.000\n that they're spending more money than they are earning,\n\n11:25.240 --> 11:28.920\n and they run out of money in the coffers,\n\n11:28.920 --> 11:33.180\n and their granaries are empty rather than stocked\n\n11:33.180 --> 11:35.360\n so that they give them the buffer.\n\n11:35.360 --> 11:40.360\n And as that deteriorates, that worsens conditions.\n\n11:40.360 --> 11:44.480\n And if they have a rival power that's also challenging them,\n\n11:44.480 --> 11:48.840\n they see greater internal conflict over wealth,\n\n11:48.840 --> 11:52.440\n and then they have the problems internally\n\n11:52.440 --> 11:54.120\n and the problems externally,\n\n11:54.120 --> 11:59.120\n which usually results in an internal war or an external war\n\n11:59.480 --> 12:03.000\n that leads to the change to the new world order.\n\n12:03.000 --> 12:07.740\n And to you, the Dutch Empire is a good example of that.\n\n12:07.740 --> 12:11.140\n The British, what are some of the key examples\n\n12:11.140 --> 12:13.140\n that you think about in the book\n\n12:13.140 --> 12:16.280\n of this process that followed the big cycle?\n\n12:16.280 --> 12:19.160\n Well, the leading reserve currency empires,\n\n12:19.160 --> 12:21.420\n but it applies to all the empires,\n\n12:22.980 --> 12:27.780\n were the Dutch, the British, the American, and the Chinese.\n\n12:28.780 --> 12:32.620\n But you could follow the same pattern.\n\n12:32.620 --> 12:35.420\n In the book, it was very important for me\n\n12:35.420 --> 12:39.000\n to not just use words and concepts\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.380\n because that's subjective.\n\n12:41.380 --> 12:45.780\n It was very important for me to use actual measurements.\n\n12:45.780 --> 12:49.460\n So as you see in the book, you can see every level of this.\n\n12:49.460 --> 12:52.060\n You can see where's the education level,\n\n12:52.060 --> 12:55.540\n what is the military power, each one of those,\n\n12:55.540 --> 12:59.300\n and you could see them back going over the 500 years.\n\n12:59.300 --> 13:03.380\n And so you could see the arcs and the composition\n\n13:03.380 --> 13:07.260\n of those arcs, and what you see is really,\n\n13:07.260 --> 13:10.780\n in most countries and most dynasties, you could see that.\n\n13:10.780 --> 13:13.540\n But you also can see through those numbers\n\n13:13.540 --> 13:15.980\n the health of those countries.\n\n13:15.980 --> 13:20.980\n Today, there are statistics that are in the book\n\n13:21.820 --> 13:25.140\n that show what is the level of education,\n\n13:25.140 --> 13:28.260\n what is the level of economic output,\n\n13:28.260 --> 13:32.140\n what is the level of military strength,\n\n13:32.140 --> 13:34.700\n what is the level of a number of different measures\n\n13:34.700 --> 13:38.020\n of strength, so that you can then compare that.\n\n13:38.020 --> 13:40.580\n And I think that because they're objective measures\n\n13:40.580 --> 13:43.320\n of strength that you could see change,\n\n13:44.380 --> 13:48.140\n that shows the picture of where we are today.\n\n13:48.140 --> 13:51.640\n And I think one of the most important things about the book\n\n13:51.640 --> 13:54.380\n is that it allows people to monitor\n\n13:54.380 --> 13:56.680\n how those things are transpiring.\n\n13:56.680 --> 13:58.760\n I think for policymakers,\n\n14:00.700 --> 14:03.180\n are your policymakers doing a good job?\n\n14:03.180 --> 14:06.340\n And there's so much subjectivity in that.\n\n14:06.340 --> 14:08.340\n But I think it's very simple.\n\n14:08.340 --> 14:10.900\n If those lines on the chart are improving,\n\n14:10.900 --> 14:13.340\n if your health index is improving,\n\n14:13.340 --> 14:17.660\n then you're moving toward a better life.\n\n14:17.660 --> 14:19.340\n So that's what the book works like.\n\n14:19.340 --> 14:24.100\n Also, it was used to create a model for the future.\n\n14:24.100 --> 14:28.180\n In other words, there are cause effect relationships.\n\n14:28.180 --> 14:32.060\n Everything that happens has reasons, causes,\n\n14:32.060 --> 14:34.860\n that preceded it, that made it happen.\n\n14:34.860 --> 14:38.020\n And so by having all those in numbers,\n\n14:38.020 --> 14:42.420\n one can see the probabilities of certain things happening.\n\n14:42.420 --> 14:46.780\n So that's what you see in the book.\n\n14:46.780 --> 14:49.940\n It's not just Ray's interpretation.\n\n14:49.940 --> 14:51.900\n I didn't wanna make it Ray's interpretation\n\n14:51.900 --> 14:53.860\n because I don't know if I'm right.\n\n14:53.860 --> 14:56.220\n Yeah, so one of the fascinating things in the book,\n\n14:56.220 --> 14:58.820\n so you have list these 18 measures,\n\n14:58.820 --> 15:01.460\n and there's like a little scorecard\n\n15:01.460 --> 15:04.360\n for the countries of the world today.\n\n15:04.360 --> 15:07.760\n So let's say US, China, and Europe,\n\n15:07.760 --> 15:09.980\n and what it was 20 years ago,\n\n15:09.980 --> 15:11.980\n and looking at the change from 20 years ago,\n\n15:11.980 --> 15:14.480\n and that's another indicator, the change itself,\n\n15:14.480 --> 15:17.260\n to see where things are headed.\n\n15:17.260 --> 15:21.540\n Maybe can you comment on, from a score perspective,\n\n15:21.540 --> 15:24.100\n how is US and China doing?\n\n15:24.100 --> 15:26.700\n And in the 18 measures, what are some measures\n\n15:26.700 --> 15:29.460\n that stand out to you as particularly important\n\n15:29.460 --> 15:32.500\n to think about today for the United States, for China?\n\n15:33.400 --> 15:34.700\n Well, there are a number.\n\n15:35.740 --> 15:40.740\n Financially, what you see in the United States\n\n15:41.060 --> 15:44.800\n is that we're borrowing a lot more money,\n\n15:44.800 --> 15:49.800\n creating a lot of debt, and we're printing a lot of money.\n\n15:49.800 --> 15:54.400\n And our capacity to do that is very much,\n\n15:54.400 --> 15:55.760\n is limited, first of all,\n\n15:55.760 --> 15:59.820\n because when there's a sale of a bond,\n\n15:59.820 --> 16:04.440\n when the government borrows more than it borrows money,\n\n16:04.440 --> 16:07.360\n because it spends more than it takes in,\n\n16:08.320 --> 16:10.300\n you have to sell a bond.\n\n16:10.300 --> 16:11.760\n And the world right now\n\n16:11.760 --> 16:14.800\n has a lot of US dollar denominated bonds,\n\n16:14.800 --> 16:17.220\n because as the world's reserve currency,\n\n16:17.220 --> 16:18.920\n they sell, sold on them.\n\n16:18.920 --> 16:23.920\n And they have very bad returns, negative real returns,\n\n16:24.400 --> 16:27.720\n negative real returns significantly, and so on.\n\n16:27.720 --> 16:31.600\n So that means that more bonds\n\n16:31.600 --> 16:36.660\n has to be sold than are bought.\n\n16:36.660 --> 16:39.560\n And that means that the Federal Reserve\n\n16:40.600 --> 16:43.640\n is faced with the choice of having to raise\n\n16:43.640 --> 16:47.100\n the interest rate to curtail borrowing,\n\n16:47.100 --> 16:49.960\n which slows the economy and hurts the markets,\n\n16:49.960 --> 16:54.960\n or by filling that difference and producing money,\n\n16:55.040 --> 16:59.720\n the debt monetization, which produces an inflation\n\n16:59.720 --> 17:03.440\n in goods, services, and financial assets.\n\n17:03.440 --> 17:08.440\n So in that regard, that's the United States's position.\n\n17:08.880 --> 17:13.880\n In China's case, its balance of payments is better.\n\n17:13.880 --> 17:17.580\n China has displaced the United States\n\n17:17.580 --> 17:20.900\n as the world's largest trading country.\n\n17:20.900 --> 17:23.580\n In other words, more exports to other countries.\n\n17:23.580 --> 17:28.580\n And as a result, it's economically competitive,\n\n17:28.860 --> 17:31.540\n but it doesn't have the world's reserve currency.\n\n17:31.540 --> 17:32.980\n It's a real blessing.\n\n17:32.980 --> 17:36.780\n So the United States, it has the world's reserve currency,\n\n17:36.780 --> 17:40.300\n but it is risking it because of this imbalance.\n\n17:40.300 --> 17:42.300\n So if you look at history,\n\n17:42.300 --> 17:45.380\n you see that those go slowly,\n\n17:45.380 --> 17:49.020\n but when they go eventually, they go quickly.\n\n17:50.140 --> 17:54.820\n So there's a risk of that financially.\n\n17:54.820 --> 17:58.500\n Then there's the issue of internal order.\n\n17:58.500 --> 18:00.260\n So I'm just giving you the major ones,\n\n18:00.260 --> 18:02.720\n but I'll get into some of the other ones too.\n\n18:02.720 --> 18:06.920\n Right now, there's a lot of internal conflict\n\n18:06.920 --> 18:09.900\n in the United States, which affects\n\n18:09.900 --> 18:13.340\n how well it works.\n\n18:14.240 --> 18:17.660\n In China, there's less internal conflict\n\n18:17.660 --> 18:20.740\n because it's a more autocratic state,\n\n18:20.740 --> 18:24.420\n but also they've created this bifurcation\n\n18:24.420 --> 18:29.420\n of what is political and what is economic\n\n18:29.700 --> 18:32.040\n in terms of producing that prosperity.\n\n18:32.040 --> 18:34.700\n So if you stay out of the politics pretty much,\n\n18:35.940 --> 18:39.640\n and then you're seeing entrepreneurship,\n\n18:39.640 --> 18:44.340\n you're seeing the finances of new businesses and so on.\n\n18:44.340 --> 18:46.840\n And so that internal working,\n\n18:48.020 --> 18:51.300\n that's subject to different people's interpretations\n\n18:51.300 --> 18:52.540\n whether they like it or not,\n\n18:52.540 --> 18:55.660\n but the internal conflict in terms of those kinds\n\n18:55.660 --> 18:57.940\n of measures is less.\n\n18:57.940 --> 19:00.160\n Sorry to pause on that for a second.\n\n19:00.160 --> 19:02.780\n So these measures, I guess you don't want\n\n19:02.780 --> 19:06.820\n to sort of romanticize any one measure\n\n19:06.820 --> 19:09.980\n or something like that, overinterpret any one measure,\n\n19:09.980 --> 19:13.940\n but is internal conflict always a bad thing?\n\n19:13.940 --> 19:18.280\n Is it a complicated calculation?\n\n19:18.280 --> 19:19.740\n Or do you kind of, the way we think\n\n19:19.740 --> 19:21.420\n about these measures that you've presented,\n\n19:21.420 --> 19:24.900\n we should be thinking like the higher, the better,\n\n19:24.900 --> 19:27.100\n the lower, the worse, I mean, of course,\n\n19:27.100 --> 19:27.940\n depending on the measure.\n\n19:27.940 --> 19:32.140\n Well, in many cases, the conflict that produces\n\n19:32.140 --> 19:37.020\n the revolution produces revolutionary changes\n\n19:37.020 --> 19:42.020\n that lead to resolutions and lead to new starts.\n\n19:44.580 --> 19:49.580\n And so a short term civil war is a hellacious experience.\n\n19:52.900 --> 19:57.660\n And at the same time, it can be the transition\n\n19:57.660 --> 19:58.940\n to a new beginning.\n\n19:58.940 --> 20:02.740\n Also, there are different types of conflict.\n\n20:03.780 --> 20:08.780\n Competition, which makes things, makes everything better,\n\n20:08.980 --> 20:13.980\n is a productive conflict, whereas destructive conflicts\n\n20:16.000 --> 20:20.940\n are not good over the short time.\n\n20:20.940 --> 20:23.620\n So that's how those go.\n\n20:23.620 --> 20:28.620\n So within each measure, the story is complicated.\n\n20:29.180 --> 20:32.300\n Yeah, but my measures are sort of clear,\n\n20:32.300 --> 20:35.180\n meaning how much political conflict,\n\n20:35.180 --> 20:38.780\n how much social conflict.\n\n20:38.780 --> 20:40.620\n In other words, you can measure conflict,\n\n20:40.620 --> 20:44.220\n you can measure fighting, you can measure crime rates,\n\n20:44.220 --> 20:49.220\n you can measure lots of different ways of conflict.\n\n20:49.640 --> 20:53.420\n So the measures are a composite of different types\n\n20:53.420 --> 20:55.620\n of internal conflict.\n\n20:55.620 --> 20:57.860\n What are some other interesting measures,\n\n20:57.860 --> 20:59.940\n maybe if you can also mention that,\n\n20:59.940 --> 21:03.300\n for me in particular, interest is education and innovation.\n\n21:03.300 --> 21:08.300\n Yes, the classic cycle, the most important leading indicator\n\n21:08.740 --> 21:11.220\n is the quality of education.\n\n21:11.220 --> 21:16.060\n Most importantly, broad based education\n\n21:16.060 --> 21:18.860\n drawn from the largest population\n\n21:18.860 --> 21:23.060\n because you can never tell who the talent is going to be.\n\n21:23.060 --> 21:25.100\n So where are they gonna come from?\n\n21:25.100 --> 21:28.180\n So for example, if you look at the Chinese dynasties,\n\n21:28.180 --> 21:33.180\n the great Chinese dynasties and the Confucian approach,\n\n21:33.220 --> 21:38.220\n it was meritocratic of everybody could sit for exams\n\n21:38.580 --> 21:41.580\n and so on broad base of drawing in the populations.\n\n21:41.580 --> 21:44.180\n And you see that if you go across societies\n\n21:45.140 --> 21:49.060\n because that draws on the largest number of population\n\n21:49.060 --> 21:50.980\n to get education.\n\n21:50.980 --> 21:55.980\n And it also, that creates a reality and a perception\n\n21:58.260 --> 22:01.300\n that the system is fair, equal opportunity,\n\n22:01.300 --> 22:03.020\n not just one of privilege.\n\n22:03.020 --> 22:06.340\n And that helps to create social stability.\n\n22:06.340 --> 22:11.340\n But education is not just education in understanding facts\n\n22:13.820 --> 22:17.780\n and so on, it is education in civility\n\n22:17.780 --> 22:19.260\n of how to behave together.\n\n22:19.260 --> 22:21.260\n And so if they're smart,\n\n22:21.260 --> 22:23.940\n they understand how to be productive\n\n22:23.940 --> 22:27.340\n because they work well together and they're productive.\n\n22:27.340 --> 22:30.060\n And then that leads to the next stage.\n\n22:30.060 --> 22:35.060\n You could see in the lines in the charts, I plotted these\n\n22:35.100 --> 22:37.700\n so that you could see in a typical cycle,\n\n22:37.700 --> 22:42.300\n you could see that education is the long leading indicator.\n\n22:42.300 --> 22:45.380\n And then you could see, as you mentioned,\n\n22:45.380 --> 22:49.700\n that what you see is inventiveness and technology measures\n\n22:49.700 --> 22:54.180\n then follow and you see then also competitiveness\n\n22:54.180 --> 22:55.940\n and world markets follows.\n\n22:55.940 --> 22:59.140\n For example, in the early stages of a cycle,\n\n22:59.140 --> 23:04.140\n the industries that they go into tend to be very basic\n\n23:04.180 --> 23:06.220\n industry because they have cheap labor,\n\n23:06.220 --> 23:10.460\n something like textiles and simple manufactured goods\n\n23:10.460 --> 23:11.340\n and so on.\n\n23:11.340 --> 23:13.540\n But as the education rises,\n\n23:13.540 --> 23:18.540\n then they move up the value chain to greater technologies\n\n23:19.100 --> 23:23.180\n and so on, which raises incomes and raises productivity.\n\n23:23.180 --> 23:25.940\n So yes, those and as you say,\n\n23:25.940 --> 23:28.300\n there are 18 different measures like that,\n\n23:28.300 --> 23:32.740\n but education and then civility and the inventiveness.\n\n23:32.740 --> 23:37.060\n So you see it reflected in who's inventing what.\n\n23:38.060 --> 23:41.780\n And that corresponds then who's trading with,\n\n23:41.780 --> 23:43.620\n who's a big trading country\n\n23:43.620 --> 23:46.180\n and where's the value of economic output\n\n23:46.180 --> 23:47.740\n and what are per capita incomes.\n\n23:47.740 --> 23:49.700\n They all follow those arcs.\n\n23:51.100 --> 23:53.740\n Yeah, like you said, the fascinating thing about your book,\n\n23:53.740 --> 23:58.620\n so there's philosophy, there's wisdom, but there's plots.\n\n23:58.620 --> 24:01.020\n Yeah, you can see it.\n\n24:01.020 --> 24:02.340\n So it's not just your opinion.\n\n24:02.340 --> 24:06.300\n It's kind of like you can interpret it in any way you like,\n\n24:06.300 --> 24:09.580\n but you're just giving a lot of your own insights\n\n24:09.580 --> 24:12.020\n along with the numbers.\n\n24:12.020 --> 24:15.580\n If you were to look at the American nation,\n\n24:15.580 --> 24:18.420\n the American empire and the trajectories\n\n24:18.420 --> 24:21.420\n looking into the future given these measures,\n\n24:22.620 --> 24:25.940\n what is the trajectory that leads to the collapse\n\n24:25.940 --> 24:28.860\n of the American empire based on these measures?\n\n24:28.860 --> 24:30.540\n What are the concerning indicators\n\n24:30.540 --> 24:34.460\n and if those break down further, what does that look like?\n\n24:34.460 --> 24:39.460\n Well, all of those indicators are concerning,\n\n24:41.460 --> 24:46.460\n maybe except for one, which is technology,\n\n24:47.100 --> 24:51.100\n the technology niche, although even in that area,\n\n24:51.100 --> 24:56.100\n the United States is improving at a slower rate\n\n24:56.100 --> 25:00.580\n than is China for various advantages that they have there.\n\n25:00.580 --> 25:03.900\n They put out about eight times as many computer engineers\n\n25:03.900 --> 25:08.420\n they have free data and so on, but if you look at them,\n\n25:08.420 --> 25:12.180\n so the financial is a concern.\n\n25:12.180 --> 25:17.180\n The internal order, disorder is a concern.\n\n25:17.620 --> 25:20.340\n Then if you look at education levels,\n\n25:20.340 --> 25:23.580\n the United States is in many ways\n\n25:23.580 --> 25:27.060\n is losing its educational advantage.\n\n25:27.060 --> 25:30.060\n If you were to look at, compare it with China,\n\n25:30.060 --> 25:34.500\n if you take general public education in the United States,\n\n25:34.500 --> 25:37.420\n it's deteriorated tremendously\n\n25:37.420 --> 25:40.300\n even in comparison to developed countries.\n\n25:40.300 --> 25:42.460\n There are scores, PISA scores and so on,\n\n25:42.460 --> 25:45.420\n and it's something like 38th in the world or something\n\n25:45.420 --> 25:48.980\n and that was a big plunge, average public education.\n\n25:48.980 --> 25:52.420\n If you look at the best universities in the world,\n\n25:52.420 --> 25:54.140\n the United States is unique\n\n25:54.140 --> 25:56.420\n in having the best universities in the world,\n\n25:56.420 --> 25:58.740\n so there are these privileged universities\n\n25:58.740 --> 26:02.340\n in the world, so there are these privileged spots\n\n26:02.340 --> 26:06.380\n that are, you know, excellent, uniquely excellent.\n\n26:06.380 --> 26:09.180\n So when you look at the comparison,\n\n26:09.180 --> 26:13.660\n education in China is improving rapidly\n\n26:13.660 --> 26:18.660\n and the quantity is a quantity of educated people\n\n26:19.100 --> 26:23.500\n in the areas that they're moving in is greater\n\n26:23.500 --> 26:27.140\n and the resources that they're putting behind it is greater\n\n26:27.140 --> 26:29.460\n and so you see the results are greater,\n\n26:30.460 --> 26:34.420\n but it's sort of along the lines that I'm dealing with.\n\n26:34.420 --> 26:36.500\n If you were to follow through\n\n26:36.500 --> 26:40.300\n in terms of actual productions,\n\n26:40.300 --> 26:44.980\n I think you know in terms of technologies,\n\n26:44.980 --> 26:48.940\n there are some areas that the United States is in a lead\n\n26:48.940 --> 26:51.820\n at the moment, there's some areas that China's in a lead,\n\n26:51.820 --> 26:54.900\n but China's gaining very quickly.\n\n26:54.900 --> 26:58.140\n When I first went to China, 1984,\n\n26:58.140 --> 27:01.100\n I would bring $10 calculators\n\n27:01.100 --> 27:05.020\n and I gave them away as gifts to high ranking people\n\n27:05.020 --> 27:07.300\n and they thought they were miracle devices.\n\n27:08.700 --> 27:13.260\n Right now, in terms of areas like quantum computing\n\n27:13.260 --> 27:18.180\n and AI and you know, many areas,\n\n27:18.180 --> 27:20.420\n you have a race going on\n\n27:20.420 --> 27:24.780\n and so if you take the trajectory of the competitiveness,\n\n27:24.780 --> 27:26.900\n not just look at the current level,\n\n27:26.900 --> 27:29.300\n you have a situation where they're improving\n\n27:29.300 --> 27:31.180\n at a much faster rate.\n\n27:31.180 --> 27:34.940\n This is all good for the world if the world can get along.\n\n27:36.660 --> 27:38.580\n And the main thing I think is,\n\n27:43.100 --> 27:44.340\n how do you have a healthy world\n\n27:44.340 --> 27:45.900\n and how do you have a strong economy\n\n27:45.900 --> 27:49.860\n and how do you have a strong situation is be strong.\n\n27:49.860 --> 27:53.540\n The United States is war is with itself.\n\n27:53.540 --> 27:55.340\n That's the main war.\n\n27:55.340 --> 27:57.420\n You know, it's very simple in history.\n\n27:59.500 --> 28:02.980\n Be financially sound, earn more than you spend\n\n28:04.660 --> 28:08.140\n and be strong in these ways\n\n28:08.140 --> 28:10.740\n and pretty much everything will take care of itself.\n\n28:13.220 --> 28:15.140\n But you make it sound simple of course\n\n28:15.140 --> 28:17.940\n because there's a momentum when things degrade,\n\n28:17.940 --> 28:19.620\n when the education system degrades,\n\n28:19.620 --> 28:21.700\n when you start borrowing,\n\n28:21.700 --> 28:24.100\n when I mean, all of these indicators,\n\n28:24.100 --> 28:28.380\n once they're going down, there's a momentum to it, right?\n\n28:28.380 --> 28:30.140\n So it's hard to reverse it.\n\n28:30.140 --> 28:33.620\n Right and there are circumstances that you're then in.\n\n28:33.620 --> 28:36.940\n For example, indebtedness.\n\n28:36.940 --> 28:41.100\n You know, it's politically desirable\n\n28:41.100 --> 28:44.700\n for those to borrow money and spend\n\n28:44.700 --> 28:49.260\n because their constituencies only look at what they get\n\n28:49.260 --> 28:51.900\n and when they get a lot, they don't pay attention\n\n28:51.900 --> 28:55.140\n to the balance sheet and how much debt is on the books.\n\n28:55.140 --> 28:58.620\n So it's always better to borrow, spend\n\n28:58.620 --> 29:01.820\n and then leave the cleanup to the next guy.\n\n29:01.820 --> 29:04.780\n And so you inherit a lot.\n\n29:04.780 --> 29:09.420\n You inherit it as a new president enters in\n\n29:09.420 --> 29:13.340\n or new legislators, they have a lot of debt,\n\n29:13.340 --> 29:16.260\n they have a broken down infrastructure,\n\n29:16.260 --> 29:19.860\n they don't have enough money to fix that.\n\n29:19.860 --> 29:22.420\n And so that's the lay of the land\n\n29:22.420 --> 29:26.780\n that the prior generations put you in\n\n29:26.780 --> 29:28.300\n and there you are.\n\n29:28.300 --> 29:30.700\n And so that's right.\n\n29:30.700 --> 29:33.020\n It's difficult because when you start to think,\n\n29:33.020 --> 29:34.540\n okay, what's healthy?\n\n29:34.540 --> 29:37.060\n Well, earn more than you spend.\n\n29:37.060 --> 29:38.820\n Well, that's not so easy\n\n29:38.820 --> 29:41.180\n because you know, what does that mean?\n\n29:41.180 --> 29:42.620\n Go earn more?\n\n29:42.620 --> 29:44.980\n I mean, okay, that's not so easy.\n\n29:44.980 --> 29:47.220\n Spend less?\n\n29:47.220 --> 29:49.020\n That isn't gonna work.\n\n29:49.020 --> 29:50.620\n So now what do you do?\n\n29:50.620 --> 29:54.180\n Okay, you have this debt that you then monetize\n\n29:54.180 --> 29:55.660\n and that's why it's classic.\n\n29:55.660 --> 29:57.740\n So yes, that's why these cycles occur\n\n29:57.740 --> 30:00.740\n because what has created before,\n\n30:00.740 --> 30:03.380\n what happened before created the lay of the land\n\n30:03.380 --> 30:06.420\n that is then increasingly difficult to deal with.\n\n30:06.420 --> 30:08.700\n So what can great leaders do in this moment?\n\n30:08.700 --> 30:13.500\n I mean, maybe my sense is leadership is crucial here.\n\n30:13.500 --> 30:16.180\n So for example, to do very large projects\n\n30:16.180 --> 30:18.260\n and invest in the education system\n\n30:18.260 --> 30:21.900\n that sort of try to fix the fundamentals\n\n30:21.900 --> 30:25.900\n or maybe invest more and more into the innovation\n\n30:25.900 --> 30:28.420\n and the development of new technologies and so on.\n\n30:29.500 --> 30:32.860\n It feels like that just doesn't happen organically.\n\n30:33.900 --> 30:37.660\n So you have to have strong leaders\n\n30:37.660 --> 30:41.060\n that convince the populace\n\n30:41.060 --> 30:43.660\n of the importance of these ideas.\n\n30:43.660 --> 30:46.620\n Well, I completely agree with your list.\n\n30:46.620 --> 30:48.300\n What we have is a situation\n\n30:48.300 --> 30:52.260\n where everybody has their opinions\n\n30:52.260 --> 30:54.780\n and they have to sort of get them exactly right\n\n30:54.780 --> 30:56.660\n and they all fight with each other\n\n30:56.660 --> 30:58.300\n about whether their opinions.\n\n30:58.300 --> 31:03.300\n So the most important thing is that we become bipartisan\n\n31:03.500 --> 31:07.020\n so that we don't and we get over our differences.\n\n31:07.020 --> 31:10.260\n I would have a bipartisan cabinet.\n\n31:10.260 --> 31:15.260\n I would draw upon both members of both parties,\n\n31:15.820 --> 31:19.500\n the moderates who are going to be able to work together.\n\n31:20.460 --> 31:24.340\n So as then we have one country\n\n31:24.340 --> 31:27.820\n and then we deal with those in a means\n\n31:27.820 --> 31:30.740\n that works for the majority of the people in the middle\n\n31:30.740 --> 31:32.460\n rather than the polarity.\n\n31:32.460 --> 31:37.460\n I think our greatest risk is in not being able to do that.\n\n31:37.460 --> 31:41.700\n So I would say that's a paramount importance\n\n31:41.700 --> 31:44.060\n because we have the resources,\n\n31:45.860 --> 31:48.860\n wealth, real wealth and science\n\n31:48.860 --> 31:51.900\n and everything has never been better than it is.\n\n31:51.900 --> 31:54.100\n But the notion is that it has to work\n\n31:54.100 --> 31:56.180\n for the majority of people\n\n31:56.180 --> 31:59.820\n and we have to keep it being productive.\n\n31:59.820 --> 32:04.820\n So that group has got to calmly and knowledgeably\n\n32:04.820 --> 32:09.780\n work together so that they increase the size of the pie\n\n32:09.780 --> 32:12.660\n and they create broad based prosperity.\n\n32:12.660 --> 32:15.660\n So that is a paramount importance.\n\n32:15.660 --> 32:18.900\n Whatever they do, if they do it that way,\n\n32:18.900 --> 32:20.980\n I can say I'm happy about\n\n32:20.980 --> 32:23.340\n because that other alternative\n\n32:23.340 --> 32:25.820\n is the really scary alternative.\n\n32:28.420 --> 32:31.500\n The scary alternative,\n\n32:31.500 --> 32:35.860\n the different ways it has evolved throughout history,\n\n32:35.860 --> 32:38.020\n some of it has led to wars.\n\n32:39.420 --> 32:41.740\n What are the future trajectories\n\n32:41.740 --> 32:44.420\n that lead to a potential war with China?\n\n32:44.420 --> 32:46.980\n Cold war or hot war?\n\n32:46.980 --> 32:48.260\n Is this something you think about?\n\n32:48.260 --> 32:50.260\n Is this something you're worried about?\n\n32:50.260 --> 32:52.380\n Yeah, I'd like to talk about both wars.\n\n32:52.380 --> 32:54.940\n So the war with China, as I say,\n\n32:54.940 --> 32:56.860\n there are five kinds of wars.\n\n32:56.860 --> 33:01.860\n There's a trade war, technology war, geopolitical influence\n\n33:02.420 --> 33:07.260\n war, capital war, and military war.\n\n33:08.780 --> 33:10.700\n As far as military war goes,\n\n33:10.700 --> 33:15.700\n I think it's only a Taiwan issue, but that's a big issue.\n\n33:16.500 --> 33:18.740\n And we could talk about that for a minute,\n\n33:18.740 --> 33:22.940\n but those others, they'll be rough competitions\n\n33:22.940 --> 33:27.620\n and we'll have that type of evolution over a period of time.\n\n33:27.620 --> 33:30.420\n That's what that war looks like.\n\n33:30.420 --> 33:34.140\n Taiwan has been, for a long time,\n\n33:35.940 --> 33:38.460\n a sovereignty issue to China.\n\n33:40.540 --> 33:42.900\n And it has its roots\n\n33:42.900 --> 33:46.100\n in what's called the 100 years of humiliation.\n\n33:47.140 --> 33:52.140\n From the 1840s to 1949, foreign powers came in,\n\n33:52.140 --> 33:56.140\n took advantage of China, they had the opium wars\n\n33:56.140 --> 34:00.660\n and such times, and that represented\n\n34:00.660 --> 34:03.060\n the 100 years of humiliation.\n\n34:03.060 --> 34:08.060\n And Taiwan represents their sovereignty\n\n34:09.140 --> 34:11.020\n and their important thing.\n\n34:11.020 --> 34:14.620\n And 50 years ago, starting 50 years ago,\n\n34:14.620 --> 34:18.420\n there was an agreement that there is one China\n\n34:18.420 --> 34:21.580\n and Taiwan is part of China.\n\n34:21.580 --> 34:26.580\n And that there would be peaceful reunification.\n\n34:26.980 --> 34:31.460\n The peaceful reunification hasn't happened.\n\n34:31.460 --> 34:34.940\n And in their view, that's a very big issue.\n\n34:34.940 --> 34:37.540\n And so it's a big contentious issue.\n\n34:37.540 --> 34:41.820\n And that could produce a military war,\n\n34:41.820 --> 34:43.540\n could produce a military accident,\n\n34:43.540 --> 34:46.020\n could produce, it's a very tense situation.\n\n34:46.020 --> 34:49.820\n And if we had a military war, God help us\n\n34:49.820 --> 34:53.660\n because of the capacity in all different new ways\n\n34:53.660 --> 34:56.380\n to inflict harm on each other.\n\n34:56.380 --> 34:58.700\n But anyway, that's that.\n\n34:58.700 --> 35:01.700\n If you don't have that military war,\n\n35:01.700 --> 35:06.340\n you'll have the competition between those other kinds of wars\n\n35:06.340 --> 35:11.340\n and whoever is strongest in those areas will win.\n\n35:11.380 --> 35:14.660\n Where do you put cyber war within the five?\n\n35:14.660 --> 35:17.380\n Well, cyber war is a military war.\n\n35:17.380 --> 35:22.020\n I'm assuming the type of cyber war that you're referring to\n\n35:22.020 --> 35:24.580\n is that which is used to inflict pain\n\n35:24.580 --> 35:26.780\n on the other party through cyber.\n\n35:26.780 --> 35:29.700\n So cyber wars, you'll see cyber war.\n\n35:29.700 --> 35:31.900\n You could see space war.\n\n35:31.900 --> 35:34.380\n You can see drone warfare.\n\n35:35.900 --> 35:40.500\n New types of warfare, not just the traditional\n\n35:40.500 --> 35:42.680\n and nuclear type of warfare.\n\n35:42.680 --> 35:44.380\n But you could see any of the above.\n\n35:44.380 --> 35:48.860\n What are the defining characteristics?\n\n35:48.860 --> 35:51.700\n What are the interesting things about Xi Jinping,\n\n35:51.700 --> 35:55.900\n the president of China, as a leader on the world stage?\n\n35:55.900 --> 36:00.340\n His father was a early leader.\n\n36:01.660 --> 36:06.660\n He was himself in the Cultural Revolution in times,\n\n36:09.380 --> 36:12.260\n treated brutally.\n\n36:12.260 --> 36:17.260\n And during that period of time, it was very, very difficult.\n\n36:17.820 --> 36:21.500\n And he came up through the ranks\n\n36:21.500 --> 36:25.280\n and he's a very intelligent man.\n\n36:26.540 --> 36:29.300\n When he first came to power,\n\n36:29.300 --> 36:32.140\n as you know, they have two five year terms,\n\n36:32.140 --> 36:34.620\n and we're now coming to the end\n\n36:34.620 --> 36:36.740\n of the second of those five year terms.\n\n36:36.740 --> 36:38.980\n When he first came to power,\n\n36:38.980 --> 36:42.860\n he felt that there should be a lot of reform.\n\n36:42.860 --> 36:46.540\n And reform meant moving to much more\n\n36:46.540 --> 36:49.380\n of a market and open economy.\n\n36:49.380 --> 36:53.140\n When that happened, him coming in,\n\n36:53.140 --> 36:56.940\n I had some contact with economic policymakers,\n\n36:56.940 --> 36:59.340\n but in the circumstances then,\n\n36:59.340 --> 37:03.860\n were that five major banks lent to state owned enterprises\n\n37:03.860 --> 37:07.820\n and local governments with implied government guarantees.\n\n37:07.820 --> 37:10.100\n And so there was not control of that\n\n37:10.100 --> 37:14.100\n and the movement to aim more of a market economy.\n\n37:14.100 --> 37:17.780\n And the development of markets was a primary\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:20.900\n and also the dealing with the corruption issue.\n\n37:20.900 --> 37:24.140\n There was a lot of corruption prior to that,\n\n37:24.140 --> 37:28.500\n and that was viewed as an existential threat to the system.\n\n37:28.500 --> 37:31.620\n So that became the primary objective.\n\n37:31.620 --> 37:36.620\n And then as time progressed over those 10 years,\n\n37:36.620 --> 37:41.620\n there was a lot of changing in the world,\n\n37:42.020 --> 37:43.820\n their financial circumstances,\n\n37:43.820 --> 37:46.940\n opening many, many other markets.\n\n37:46.940 --> 37:48.460\n They particularly getting money\n\n37:48.460 --> 37:51.180\n to small and medium sized enterprises\n\n37:51.180 --> 37:52.940\n and developing a lending system\n\n37:52.940 --> 37:55.340\n and then establishing controls on it.\n\n37:55.340 --> 38:00.340\n So right now there's a vibrant capital markets.\n\n38:00.340 --> 38:03.340\n You can raise capital, you can be an entrepreneur,\n\n38:03.340 --> 38:07.860\n you can become a billionaire in the capital markets.\n\n38:07.860 --> 38:09.180\n And they developed the markets\n\n38:09.180 --> 38:11.900\n to be the second largest capital markets.\n\n38:11.900 --> 38:15.700\n At the same time, they had to deal\n\n38:15.700 --> 38:18.540\n with their rising debt issue,\n\n38:18.540 --> 38:23.540\n which they began to deal with really about four years ago,\n\n38:24.060 --> 38:27.740\n when the second largest capital markets\n\n38:27.740 --> 38:32.740\n were about four years ago, when the second term began.\n\n38:33.460 --> 38:38.460\n And then Lu He became the vice premier\n\n38:41.740 --> 38:46.340\n responsible for that and to deal with those issues.\n\n38:46.340 --> 38:49.860\n So you see right now that what's happening\n\n38:49.860 --> 38:53.140\n is the dealing with the real estate bubble.\n\n38:53.140 --> 38:55.980\n There was a development in real estate, a bubble,\n\n38:55.980 --> 38:59.980\n which produced a lot of unproductive lending.\n\n38:59.980 --> 39:04.980\n And Xi Jinping said, houses are meant to live in,\n\n39:06.500 --> 39:08.260\n not to speculate on.\n\n39:08.260 --> 39:09.860\n And so that was wasteful.\n\n39:09.860 --> 39:12.900\n So they established what they call three red lines,\n\n39:12.900 --> 39:14.900\n which are financial ratios,\n\n39:14.900 --> 39:18.380\n that the property developers had to live within.\n\n39:18.380 --> 39:21.820\n And that is then causing the adjustments\n\n39:21.820 --> 39:25.260\n that are going on now, which in my view are very healthy\n\n39:25.260 --> 39:28.980\n because whenever there's bankruptcies\n\n39:28.980 --> 39:33.140\n and so on, most in the public think, okay, that's a problem.\n\n39:33.140 --> 39:36.300\n It's in many cases really a cleaning up of bad debts\n\n39:36.300 --> 39:37.420\n and bad practices.\n\n39:37.420 --> 39:40.060\n And so that's what's going on.\n\n39:40.060 --> 39:42.620\n So that's, let's say economically.\n\n39:42.620 --> 39:47.620\n At the same time, there is the changing relationships,\n\n39:48.220 --> 39:51.500\n the changing world order, the changing relationships\n\n39:51.500 --> 39:54.140\n with the United States and other countries,\n\n39:54.140 --> 39:57.940\n which is becoming much less cooperative\n\n39:57.940 --> 40:01.620\n and much more warlike, much more confrontational.\n\n40:02.660 --> 40:06.780\n Those two things, the domestic debt problem\n\n40:06.780 --> 40:11.140\n and the domestic, has led to what's called core,\n\n40:11.140 --> 40:13.140\n what they call core leadership,\n\n40:13.140 --> 40:17.180\n which means a leadership more around him\n\n40:17.180 --> 40:21.180\n that is less challenging\n\n40:21.180 --> 40:23.380\n because they believe in history\n\n40:23.380 --> 40:26.300\n that during very difficult times,\n\n40:26.300 --> 40:29.820\n a more centrally controlled decision making process\n\n40:29.820 --> 40:32.740\n lends itself better than to a more fragmented\n\n40:32.740 --> 40:35.020\n political contentious project.\n\n40:35.020 --> 40:38.340\n And that's basically what's going on now.\n\n40:39.820 --> 40:42.060\n You said it very eloquently,\n\n40:42.060 --> 40:46.580\n but you mean the leadership is surrounded by yes men\n\n40:46.580 --> 40:50.100\n and there's a lot of centralized control.\n\n40:50.100 --> 40:55.100\n That characterization is much more black and white\n\n40:55.420 --> 40:56.620\n than it really is.\n\n40:57.620 --> 41:00.340\n But it leans towards that direction.\n\n41:00.340 --> 41:02.300\n Like for example, of the standing members\n\n41:02.300 --> 41:05.180\n of the Politburo, four are more allotted,\n\n41:07.100 --> 41:09.460\n three are less so.\n\n41:09.460 --> 41:11.540\n You have to understand that it's kind of\n\n41:11.540 --> 41:14.580\n a collective leadership at the top.\n\n41:14.580 --> 41:18.580\n And then of course, there's just jockeying for power\n\n41:18.580 --> 41:22.580\n in a highly political sense at the top.\n\n41:22.580 --> 41:25.980\n But no one leader can be successful\n\n41:25.980 --> 41:30.180\n against all those powers at the top.\n\n41:30.180 --> 41:32.900\n So it's very politically negotiating.\n\n41:32.900 --> 41:37.540\n It's very much more like if you put in the United States\n\n41:37.540 --> 41:39.500\n the Democrats and the Republicans\n\n41:39.500 --> 41:41.340\n and they had to be in the same government\n\n41:41.340 --> 41:43.060\n and they work it out.\n\n41:43.060 --> 41:45.140\n It's kind of something like that.\n\n41:45.140 --> 41:49.740\n And so that's that struggle, but it's an internal struggle.\n\n41:49.740 --> 41:53.020\n Where do you put the importance of some of these ideas\n\n41:53.020 --> 41:55.260\n at the founding of the United States\n\n41:55.260 --> 41:59.340\n when now we're talking about that at the context of China,\n\n41:59.340 --> 42:02.460\n the freedom of speech, freedoms?\n\n42:02.460 --> 42:04.600\n What China is doing with the central management\n\n42:04.600 --> 42:08.500\n of a lot of things, it's enabling a lot of growth,\n\n42:08.500 --> 42:12.860\n but it's also limiting people on the very basic level\n\n42:12.860 --> 42:13.900\n in terms of freedom.\n\n42:13.900 --> 42:17.260\n The kind of freedom that I think can lead\n\n42:17.260 --> 42:19.740\n to entrepreneurship, to starting new businesses,\n\n42:19.740 --> 42:21.940\n to having big dreams and chasing those dreams\n\n42:21.940 --> 42:25.080\n and then creating totally new things in whatever the space,\n\n42:25.080 --> 42:29.040\n maybe in technology, in business and whatever.\n\n42:30.340 --> 42:33.420\n How important is that as a metric for society?\n\n42:33.420 --> 42:38.060\n Well, they have a view, which is the idea of a dialectic,\n\n42:38.060 --> 42:41.360\n which means that two things are at obvious,\n\n42:41.360 --> 42:43.620\n that everything comes with pros and cons\n\n42:43.620 --> 42:46.540\n and two opposites exist.\n\n42:46.540 --> 42:50.100\n And you want the benefits of those two opposites\n\n42:50.100 --> 42:54.020\n and how do you deal with the benefits of those two opposites?\n\n42:54.020 --> 42:57.380\n So let's say you want the capital markets\n\n42:57.380 --> 43:02.020\n because it gets money into the hands of the entrepreneurs\n\n43:02.020 --> 43:04.420\n who are motivated, they build fortunes,\n\n43:04.420 --> 43:07.820\n and that drives an economy to do very well.\n\n43:07.820 --> 43:12.740\n And at the same time, it produces the other problems,\n\n43:12.740 --> 43:15.460\n the wealth gaps, the other problems,\n\n43:15.460 --> 43:18.420\n the debt cycle that we're talking about and so on.\n\n43:18.420 --> 43:23.320\n And Deng Xiaoping, how do you reconcile communism\n\n43:23.320 --> 43:27.540\n and the market economy and the capital markets?\n\n43:27.540 --> 43:30.060\n And he famously said,\n\n43:32.180 --> 43:34.360\n it doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a black cat,\n\n43:34.360 --> 43:36.340\n just as long as it catches mice.\n\n43:36.340 --> 43:40.620\n In other words, if it works in making the country richer,\n\n43:40.620 --> 43:42.280\n then that becomes the objective\n\n43:42.280 --> 43:43.620\n and then they move that along.\n\n43:43.620 --> 43:45.480\n So there are these conflicts.\n\n43:46.500 --> 43:51.400\n And one of the leaders described it to me as follows,\n\n43:51.400 --> 43:53.940\n because it's confusion and it goes back\n\n43:53.940 --> 43:55.660\n over a period of time.\n\n43:55.660 --> 44:00.020\n There's a hierarchy and it's an extension of the family,\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:01.280\n he described it.\n\n44:01.280 --> 44:06.280\n And he said, the United States is a country of individuals\n\n44:06.600 --> 44:11.600\n and individualism, and that is its vibrancy\n\n44:11.600 --> 44:16.600\n that we see the individual rights to speak up,\n\n44:17.640 --> 44:22.440\n the individual protection of the individual,\n\n44:22.440 --> 44:25.540\n individual property rights and all of those things\n\n44:25.540 --> 44:28.280\n is of paramount importance.\n\n44:28.280 --> 44:29.920\n And we build our organization.\n\n44:29.920 --> 44:32.080\n That's why democracy is from the bottom up\n\n44:32.080 --> 44:34.280\n or even a company, we'll get together\n\n44:34.280 --> 44:37.480\n and we'll be partners to prosper together.\n\n44:37.480 --> 44:39.460\n That is the American approach.\n\n44:39.460 --> 44:43.380\n He was describing that in China,\n\n44:43.380 --> 44:47.860\n it's an extension of the Confucian family, essentially.\n\n44:47.860 --> 44:52.380\n And so it's almost like there's a hierarchy.\n\n44:52.380 --> 44:57.040\n And so what they think about is the common good,\n\n44:57.040 --> 44:59.420\n not the individualism.\n\n44:59.420 --> 45:02.100\n So for example, if they want a high speed rail\n\n45:02.100 --> 45:04.100\n to go from one place to another,\n\n45:04.100 --> 45:06.720\n and that's best in the common good,\n\n45:06.720 --> 45:08.820\n then the individual protections\n\n45:08.820 --> 45:11.300\n that would stand in the way of doing that\n\n45:11.300 --> 45:13.660\n would be of secondary concern.\n\n45:13.660 --> 45:17.220\n So that notion of controlling.\n\n45:17.220 --> 45:22.220\n So for example, what they're doing with video games,\n\n45:24.180 --> 45:28.240\n they control what type of video games\n\n45:28.240 --> 45:32.720\n and how many hours a day kids can be on video games\n\n45:33.900 --> 45:35.660\n operating in that way,\n\n45:35.660 --> 45:38.980\n because they believe that that's good for the society\n\n45:38.980 --> 45:40.780\n and that's very controlling.\n\n45:40.780 --> 45:42.220\n In the United States,\n\n45:42.220 --> 45:45.100\n I think probably most parents would say, leave it to me.\n\n45:45.100 --> 45:48.340\n And it's a matter between me and my kids.\n\n45:48.340 --> 45:50.660\n The same thing has to do with data.\n\n45:50.660 --> 45:52.840\n In other words, in the United States,\n\n45:52.840 --> 45:54.340\n who controls the data?\n\n45:55.220 --> 45:57.340\n Does the company control the data?\n\n45:57.340 --> 46:00.020\n Do you individually control the data?\n\n46:00.020 --> 46:03.580\n And so the inclination would be to figure that out,\n\n46:03.580 --> 46:05.640\n but nobody would say that the government\n\n46:05.640 --> 46:07.460\n is going to control the data\n\n46:07.460 --> 46:11.780\n because of our inclination of really anti government control.\n\n46:11.780 --> 46:14.180\n In China, it would be that the government\n\n46:14.180 --> 46:15.860\n will control the data\n\n46:15.860 --> 46:18.900\n because that's going to be best for the society.\n\n46:18.900 --> 46:20.340\n And it depends who you trust.\n\n46:20.340 --> 46:24.700\n But that's, so that difference in philosophy\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:28.660\n is very much at the heart of that.\n\n46:28.660 --> 46:33.100\n As far as your question in terms of effectiveness,\n\n46:33.100 --> 46:35.940\n it really is, in China's case,\n\n46:35.940 --> 46:38.140\n it's how you balance the things, right?\n\n46:38.140 --> 46:40.020\n So what they're attempting to do\n\n46:40.020 --> 46:43.660\n is to create a lot of freedom and creativity\n\n46:44.680 --> 46:48.520\n in areas that are not political, let's say.\n\n46:50.260 --> 46:53.860\n And so you see a lot of entrepreneurship,\n\n46:53.860 --> 46:55.940\n you see a lot of product development,\n\n46:55.940 --> 47:00.620\n you see a lot of creativity happening in that way.\n\n47:00.620 --> 47:04.900\n So the stereotype that you don't see creativity happening\n\n47:04.900 --> 47:06.740\n is an old stereotype,\n\n47:06.740 --> 47:09.220\n whereas a lot of creativity is certainly happening.\n\n47:09.220 --> 47:10.900\n And the system can work well\n\n47:10.900 --> 47:13.260\n if they can achieve that kind of balance.\n\n47:13.260 --> 47:15.060\n It's proven to have worked well.\n\n47:15.060 --> 47:18.300\n Since I started going there in 1984,\n\n47:18.300 --> 47:21.100\n per capita income, real per capita income,\n\n47:21.100 --> 47:24.160\n has increased by 26 times.\n\n47:24.160 --> 47:28.940\n The longevity rate has increased by 10 years.\n\n47:28.940 --> 47:33.260\n The poverty rate has fallen from 88% to less than 1%\n\n47:33.260 --> 47:37.380\n in terms of basics like starvation and things.\n\n47:37.380 --> 47:41.740\n And if you read history, Plato's Republic,\n\n47:41.740 --> 47:46.380\n he talks about the cycles, democracy and autocratic\n\n47:46.380 --> 47:49.220\n and the benevolent despot and all of that,\n\n47:50.140 --> 47:53.340\n each has their own vulnerability.\n\n47:53.340 --> 47:55.660\n The vulnerability of democracy,\n\n47:55.660 --> 47:58.780\n which has been a remarkable, remarkable system\n\n47:58.780 --> 48:02.040\n and I don't have to extol the benefits of it,\n\n48:02.980 --> 48:07.980\n but the vulnerability of it has always been\n\n48:07.980 --> 48:12.940\n the internal conflict that produces itself as anarchy.\n\n48:13.900 --> 48:18.620\n In World War II, four democracies\n\n48:18.620 --> 48:21.980\n chose to be autocracies\n\n48:22.980 --> 48:25.980\n because there was internal disorder\n\n48:25.980 --> 48:30.220\n and there was the belief, will somebody bring about order\n\n48:30.220 --> 48:32.660\n and get control of the situation?\n\n48:32.660 --> 48:37.660\n That was in Germany, Italy, Japan and Spain.\n\n48:38.040 --> 48:41.180\n They were parliamentary systems\n\n48:41.180 --> 48:43.840\n that turned themselves over to that.\n\n48:43.840 --> 48:48.840\n So both systems have vulnerabilities.\n\n48:49.460 --> 48:53.300\n I think the main thing that we need to think about\n\n48:53.300 --> 48:54.820\n is those vulnerabilities.\n\n48:54.820 --> 48:58.340\n Democracy is an amazing system\n\n48:58.340 --> 49:03.340\n because the adherence to the rules and the system\n\n49:03.500 --> 49:06.860\n and the checks and balances is quite amazing\n\n49:06.860 --> 49:10.480\n and it gives it a flexibility to change without civil wars.\n\n49:12.460 --> 49:15.060\n But there has to be the respect of the rules.\n\n49:15.060 --> 49:18.060\n And when you see something like\n\n49:18.060 --> 49:22.500\n they will not accept elections\n\n49:22.500 --> 49:27.020\n or they will not accept rules, history has shown,\n\n49:27.020 --> 49:29.660\n when the causes that people are behind\n\n49:29.660 --> 49:32.340\n are more important to them than the system,\n\n49:32.340 --> 49:34.420\n the system is in jeopardy.\n\n49:34.420 --> 49:38.260\n So we have a situation that's very much like that\n\n49:38.260 --> 49:42.500\n in terms of, let's say, the 2024 elections.\n\n49:42.500 --> 49:46.740\n I believe that there's a very high chance\n\n49:46.740 --> 49:51.740\n that neither side will accept losing, for example.\n\n49:51.740 --> 49:56.260\n And so we have that kind of a situation.\n\n49:56.260 --> 50:00.140\n So one would hope that one could rise above\n\n50:00.140 --> 50:04.740\n the disagreements and rely on the system\n\n50:04.740 --> 50:06.900\n for resolving disagreements.\n\n50:06.900 --> 50:11.700\n Because if that doesn't happen, then we have our own chaos.\n\n50:13.300 --> 50:16.780\n So the kind of the trend that started in 2020,\n\n50:16.780 --> 50:19.860\n or I mean, I suppose it's been there,\n\n50:19.860 --> 50:22.060\n it's been growing.\n\n50:22.060 --> 50:24.280\n One representation of this internal disorder\n\n50:24.280 --> 50:27.460\n has been the growing trend of being skeptical\n\n50:27.460 --> 50:29.700\n about the results of the election.\n\n50:29.700 --> 50:31.680\n Well, it started before that.\n\n50:31.680 --> 50:35.140\n There was the emergence of population\n\n50:35.140 --> 50:40.000\n before President Trump was elected.\n\n50:40.000 --> 50:43.340\n He was basically elected as a populist\n\n50:43.340 --> 50:46.840\n because there was a large percentage of the population\n\n50:46.840 --> 50:50.700\n that felt that the system didn't work for them.\n\n50:50.700 --> 50:52.660\n And he tapped into that.\n\n50:52.660 --> 50:56.100\n And he was largely elected as a populist leader,\n\n50:56.100 --> 50:59.480\n first populist leader in a developed country.\n\n51:00.620 --> 51:04.260\n And so populism began then.\n\n51:04.260 --> 51:08.460\n And that was a battle of one group against the other group.\n\n51:08.460 --> 51:12.140\n And so since then, it's been like that\n\n51:12.140 --> 51:17.140\n and it continued to grow.\n\n51:17.940 --> 51:22.940\n You've mentioned the vulnerability of democracy,\n\n51:23.020 --> 51:26.620\n that internal disorder is the vulnerability of democracy.\n\n51:26.620 --> 51:29.460\n What's the vulnerability of a system like China?\n\n51:29.460 --> 51:32.460\n Maybe one way to say is put China aside\n\n51:32.460 --> 51:34.980\n and look at history, look at Soviet Union.\n\n51:34.980 --> 51:39.880\n What's the vulnerability of a communist type system?\n\n51:39.880 --> 51:44.880\n Well, I'll call it both communist and autocratic,\n\n51:46.500 --> 51:48.940\n depending on how much autocracy,\n\n51:48.940 --> 51:52.540\n is that it lacks flexibility.\n\n51:52.540 --> 51:56.100\n It lacks the ability,\n\n51:57.140 --> 51:59.580\n but I should deal with them differently.\n\n51:59.580 --> 52:02.180\n In other words, there's the economic system.\n\n52:02.180 --> 52:07.180\n The economic system threatens motivation and productivity.\n\n52:07.180 --> 52:12.180\n So communism or socialism has to be done in a way\n\n52:12.460 --> 52:16.940\n where you can threaten productivity.\n\n52:16.940 --> 52:20.420\n Capitalism has, and what I mean by that,\n\n52:20.420 --> 52:24.620\n I mean free markets and capital markets\n\n52:24.620 --> 52:28.380\n have been an effective way of allocating resources\n\n52:28.380 --> 52:33.380\n and also creating the incentives and the resources,\n\n52:33.380 --> 52:37.620\n providing the resources for the inventiveness of new ideas.\n\n52:37.620 --> 52:42.500\n And so if I compare that, what the Chinese have done\n\n52:42.500 --> 52:45.540\n to a large extent is to recognize that\n\n52:45.540 --> 52:47.220\n and have made a move.\n\n52:47.220 --> 52:52.140\n That's why the seeming dialectic or the conflict\n\n52:52.140 --> 52:53.740\n between those two things exists.\n\n52:53.740 --> 52:55.580\n But anyway, that's it.\n\n52:55.580 --> 52:57.860\n As far as an autocratic system,\n\n52:57.860 --> 53:02.860\n rather than one man, one vote from the population up,\n\n53:04.300 --> 53:07.340\n the risks of the autocratic system\n\n53:07.340 --> 53:11.300\n is that there's enough discontent that arises\n\n53:12.260 --> 53:16.600\n that the system doesn't have the flexibility\n\n53:16.600 --> 53:20.580\n and that rather than bending, it breaks.\n\n53:21.480 --> 53:24.180\n That's the big risk.\n\n53:24.180 --> 53:28.220\n The notion of trying to control a population\n\n53:28.220 --> 53:31.420\n if there's that, rather than giving it the flexibility.\n\n53:32.380 --> 53:36.180\n So that would be the big risk of the autocratic system.\n\n53:36.180 --> 53:39.260\n What's the human, because you mentioned\n\n53:39.260 --> 53:41.580\n like the top gets bigger with the empires\n\n53:42.460 --> 53:44.800\n and you start to get things for granted.\n\n53:45.780 --> 53:48.340\n Is some of this just human nature?\n\n53:48.340 --> 53:53.340\n So the concern with China, with autocratic nations,\n\n53:53.340 --> 53:58.340\n the concern with the Third Reich, the Soviet Union,\n\n53:59.940 --> 54:03.580\n was that fundamentally at the individual level,\n\n54:03.580 --> 54:06.460\n the humans involved at the top,\n\n54:06.460 --> 54:09.600\n they start becoming, they're starting to lose touch\n\n54:09.600 --> 54:13.460\n with reality in a way that no longer makes them.\n\n54:13.460 --> 54:14.900\n I guess that's the representation,\n\n54:14.900 --> 54:16.980\n the flexibility that you're referring to.\n\n54:16.980 --> 54:21.180\n Well, I mean, in a democracy, you could change.\n\n54:21.180 --> 54:23.580\n You can go as far left or as far right.\n\n54:23.580 --> 54:25.780\n You can change the leaders easily.\n\n54:25.780 --> 54:27.700\n And so the people don't become,\n\n54:28.900 --> 54:31.140\n they pretty much only have themselves to blame.\n\n54:32.860 --> 54:35.680\n And one of the problems of that\n\n54:35.680 --> 54:37.980\n is they may not choose the best leaders,\n\n54:39.300 --> 54:42.340\n but they have that flexibility.\n\n54:42.340 --> 54:46.180\n So vote and you get what you wanted.\n\n54:46.180 --> 54:49.040\n In the case of the autocratic, let's say leaders,\n\n54:49.040 --> 54:53.060\n and then the movement from democracies to autocracies,\n\n54:54.040 --> 54:57.420\n what you see normally that movement\n\n54:57.420 --> 55:00.560\n is that one of the systems is not working.\n\n55:00.560 --> 55:02.940\n Let's say the democracy is not effectively,\n\n55:02.940 --> 55:04.500\n everybody's arguing with each other\n\n55:04.500 --> 55:06.620\n and nobody's getting anything done.\n\n55:06.620 --> 55:08.180\n You know, like Mussolini,\n\n55:08.180 --> 55:10.340\n the trains are not running on time.\n\n55:10.340 --> 55:12.240\n And that would be the example,\n\n55:12.240 --> 55:14.540\n geez, this place has gotten chaotic.\n\n55:14.540 --> 55:16.700\n Will somebody get to control?\n\n55:16.700 --> 55:19.660\n And then you get the autocratic\n\n55:20.520 --> 55:24.780\n and then he's autocratic enough to boss people around.\n\n55:24.780 --> 55:29.060\n And then you follow those kinds of orders.\n\n55:29.060 --> 55:32.700\n And it's like maybe a CEO in a powerful company\n\n55:32.700 --> 55:34.620\n going around and that could work well\n\n55:34.620 --> 55:36.380\n or it could work badly.\n\n55:36.380 --> 55:41.380\n Most companies are run as like autocracies in a sense.\n\n55:41.380 --> 55:44.980\n You know, there's the hierarchy and the command economy\n\n55:44.980 --> 55:46.660\n and that kind of thing.\n\n55:46.660 --> 55:51.660\n And that can work well or not.\n\n55:51.660 --> 55:56.660\n But then quite often when you get the populist autocratic,\n\n55:56.660 --> 56:00.260\n their personality is something that they want to fight\n\n56:01.220 --> 56:03.780\n and they become more nationalistic\n\n56:04.740 --> 56:07.700\n and they tend to become more militaristic.\n\n56:07.700 --> 56:12.700\n And human nature at that stage lends itself to fighting.\n\n56:13.180 --> 56:18.180\n There's an arc here that when we think of a country\n\n56:18.740 --> 56:22.220\n and we say we, and we think of a country,\n\n56:22.220 --> 56:24.660\n it's not true, it's not like that.\n\n56:24.660 --> 56:26.940\n There are individuals who change.\n\n56:26.940 --> 56:30.940\n One generation dies and another generation comes along.\n\n56:30.940 --> 56:35.940\n And one of those arcs is that the one generation\n\n56:35.940 --> 56:39.860\n of the ones who have been through war\n\n56:39.860 --> 56:44.260\n don't wanna go to war and are more happily willing\n\n56:44.260 --> 56:47.980\n to abide by whatever the rules are.\n\n56:47.980 --> 56:50.940\n As you get farther along into that cycle\n\n56:50.940 --> 56:53.940\n and you get a new generation and they forget about wars\n\n56:53.940 --> 56:58.940\n and the horrors of wars, then they want to fight.\n\n56:59.580 --> 57:02.820\n And so you're seeing right now the emerging\n\n57:02.820 --> 57:06.420\n of fight for right and what that means\n\n57:06.420 --> 57:10.700\n is you see it internally, fight where are you\n\n57:10.700 --> 57:14.860\n and fight for that thing and they mean fight.\n\n57:14.860 --> 57:19.340\n And then externally, fight, are you going to be\n\n57:19.340 --> 57:21.860\n the strong one who will fight and win?\n\n57:21.860 --> 57:26.060\n And that develops on both sides, this fight and win\n\n57:26.060 --> 57:30.300\n and each side is cheering each other on into a war.\n\n57:30.300 --> 57:34.700\n But that comes by those who really have not experienced war\n\n57:34.700 --> 57:37.580\n because it comes in their part of their lifetime.\n\n57:38.740 --> 57:40.660\n Humans are fascinating.\n\n57:40.660 --> 57:41.940\n Humans are fascinating.\n\n57:41.940 --> 57:45.700\n And by the way, human nature has not changed\n\n57:45.700 --> 57:48.260\n over the thousands of years.\n\n57:48.260 --> 57:51.980\n So it's so interesting because like in doing this study\n\n57:51.980 --> 57:54.060\n and it comes across in the study,\n\n57:54.060 --> 57:56.700\n it's like watching the same movie over and over again.\n\n57:56.700 --> 58:01.100\n You know, you see the arc and you see it happen\n\n58:01.100 --> 58:02.580\n over and over again.\n\n58:02.580 --> 58:05.300\n The only things that seem to change are the clothes\n\n58:05.300 --> 58:07.660\n people wear and the technologies they use.\n\n58:07.660 --> 58:12.660\n Yeah, and then somebody probably would disagree\n\n58:12.900 --> 58:13.740\n with you about the clothes.\n\n58:13.740 --> 58:16.300\n Maybe there's also cycles within fashions.\n\n58:16.300 --> 58:18.580\n Maybe we're not even creative there.\n\n58:18.580 --> 58:23.580\n What do you make of Russia and Vladimir Putin?\n\n58:23.580 --> 58:26.420\n What do you think about Putin as a leader,\n\n58:26.420 --> 58:30.460\n as a human being on this world stage within the context\n\n58:30.460 --> 58:33.900\n of the cycles of empires that you think about?\n\n58:33.900 --> 58:38.420\n Well, Putin came to power at the failure\n\n58:38.420 --> 58:41.220\n of Russia's last order.\n\n58:41.220 --> 58:43.500\n So there was the end of communism\n\n58:45.260 --> 58:47.980\n and there was the development of the market economy,\n\n58:47.980 --> 58:50.140\n the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n\n58:50.140 --> 58:55.140\n And at that time, he was appointed by Yeltsin\n\n58:57.420 --> 59:02.420\n who was an alcoholic and had problems managing\n\n59:03.220 --> 59:05.260\n and was put into power.\n\n59:05.260 --> 59:08.740\n And the conditions in the Russia were,\n\n59:08.740 --> 59:12.580\n there was anarchy, there was no money.\n\n59:12.580 --> 59:15.540\n It had the classic end of cycle ingredients.\n\n59:15.540 --> 59:16.660\n It was broke.\n\n59:16.660 --> 59:18.700\n It was people were fighting with each other.\n\n59:18.700 --> 59:20.180\n It was in the anarchy.\n\n59:20.180 --> 59:23.180\n And that's when he came to power.\n\n59:23.180 --> 59:27.620\n And there were not institutions.\n\n59:27.620 --> 59:29.180\n The whole thing had collapsed\n\n59:29.180 --> 59:31.980\n and it was not effective ministry of education,\n\n59:31.980 --> 59:33.100\n ministry of anything.\n\n59:34.180 --> 59:39.180\n And so the idea was that they needed 25 years of stability\n\n59:41.220 --> 59:43.740\n and they needed a democracy\n\n59:43.740 --> 59:47.580\n and they needed the improvement of capital markets.\n\n59:47.580 --> 59:52.580\n So he's been in that position as I guess I would call him\n\n59:56.820 --> 1:00:01.820\n a semi autocratic leader in that from all indications,\n\n1:00:02.780 --> 1:00:07.780\n he would respect the democracy and he's very popular.\n\n1:00:07.860 --> 1:00:10.180\n He's won democratic elections\n\n1:00:10.180 --> 1:00:11.980\n because he's been a strong leader\n\n1:00:11.980 --> 1:00:16.140\n and he's brought peace and stability\n\n1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:21.140\n to Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\n1:00:21.780 --> 1:00:26.780\n And he's a strong leader in pursuit of the country's interest\n\n1:00:31.340 --> 1:00:36.340\n in a way where Russia is not a significant economic power\n\n1:00:41.380 --> 1:00:43.820\n but it is a significant military power.\n\n1:00:43.820 --> 1:00:48.820\n So the issues, and then there's a strong alliance\n\n1:00:48.820 --> 1:00:50.500\n between Russia and China now.\n\n1:00:51.900 --> 1:00:54.740\n So that's kind of the lay of the land.\n\n1:00:55.620 --> 1:00:58.060\n And then there are sensitivities.\n\n1:00:58.060 --> 1:01:02.580\n The Ukraine issue is a sensitivity\n\n1:01:02.580 --> 1:01:05.900\n because of there are a lot of Russians\n\n1:01:05.900 --> 1:01:07.700\n who live in the Ukraine\n\n1:01:07.700 --> 1:01:11.580\n and there's also the issue of NATO on their border.\n\n1:01:11.580 --> 1:01:13.540\n So there are those kinds of things\n\n1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:14.980\n and he has military power\n\n1:01:14.980 --> 1:01:17.620\n and he has a strong alliance with China.\n\n1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:21.700\n And I guess that's my best summary\n\n1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:24.140\n of what his position is.\n\n1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:28.140\n He's a strong leader, popular.\n\n1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.340\n These are not subjective interpretations.\n\n1:01:33.340 --> 1:01:35.900\n These are objective interpretations.\n\n1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:38.940\n Yeah, it's interesting just in this conversation,\n\n1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:43.940\n you're not sort of doing the usual criticism\n\n1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:45.500\n of any one particular system.\n\n1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:46.740\n You're looking at these systems\n\n1:01:46.740 --> 1:01:48.700\n from the perspective of history.\n\n1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:50.900\n You're just describing how they work.\n\n1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:54.340\n It's often times when you talk about what Russia is today\n\n1:01:54.340 --> 1:01:57.340\n or what the Soviet Union was or what China is today\n\n1:01:57.340 --> 1:01:58.820\n is you start to criticize.\n\n1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:01.180\n Well, they do this kind of censorship\n\n1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:02.540\n or they do this kind of,\n\n1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:05.060\n they limit freedoms in this kind of way.\n\n1:02:05.060 --> 1:02:07.060\n But you're just kind of describing this\n\n1:02:07.060 --> 1:02:11.300\n as a nation with ideas, what they think is right.\n\n1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.300\n This is how they hope to get it to work.\n\n1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:14.580\n This is why it's working.\n\n1:02:14.580 --> 1:02:16.300\n This is what's not working.\n\n1:02:16.300 --> 1:02:19.380\n Here's metrics that show that it's not working.\n\n1:02:19.380 --> 1:02:21.740\n I think that's a refreshing way to think about it.\n\n1:02:21.740 --> 1:02:24.300\n It's easy though, I mean, you got some criticism\n\n1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:28.020\n saying that I think China is a strict parent.\n\n1:02:30.580 --> 1:02:33.140\n Some people criticize these countries for doing,\n\n1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:35.980\n for violating human rights.\n\n1:02:35.980 --> 1:02:39.580\n I suppose there's some people that criticize the United States\n\n1:02:39.580 --> 1:02:41.100\n for violating human rights.\n\n1:02:41.100 --> 1:02:46.100\n But what are your thoughts on the world stage today\n\n1:02:48.180 --> 1:02:51.740\n about some of the behaviors it has governed\n\n1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:53.340\n in terms of respecting the rights,\n\n1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:55.380\n the basic rights of human beings?\n\n1:02:55.380 --> 1:03:00.380\n You described accurately how I just tried to look at this\n\n1:03:00.380 --> 1:03:05.380\n and how I just tried to look at things in a non,\n\n1:03:05.820 --> 1:03:10.700\n I don't want to impute my values on anybody.\n\n1:03:12.180 --> 1:03:14.060\n I mean, there are intolerable things.\n\n1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:16.820\n So I'm not saying there aren't intolerable things.\n\n1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:20.380\n But one of the great things of being an American here\n\n1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:23.900\n is that I grew up with all different nationalities,\n\n1:03:23.900 --> 1:03:26.100\n having all different points of view\n\n1:03:26.100 --> 1:03:27.740\n and all different religions\n\n1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:30.500\n and all different ways of operating.\n\n1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:35.500\n And I've come to treasure the fact that that is,\n\n1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:37.980\n what's their business is their business.\n\n1:03:37.980 --> 1:03:41.180\n And then the question is, where do you cross the line\n\n1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:42.980\n under what circumstances\n\n1:03:42.980 --> 1:03:45.740\n that others have got to do it my way.\n\n1:03:45.740 --> 1:03:49.100\n And then when you do it internationally,\n\n1:03:49.100 --> 1:03:52.900\n the issue of what is a sovereign state,\n\n1:03:52.900 --> 1:03:56.020\n which as I say in the piece of Westphalia\n\n1:03:56.020 --> 1:04:00.060\n and you have borders and then when do you cross the line\n\n1:04:00.060 --> 1:04:02.700\n that my way of doing things\n\n1:04:02.700 --> 1:04:04.460\n has got to be their way of doing things\n\n1:04:04.460 --> 1:04:06.340\n or what are the various rights.\n\n1:04:06.340 --> 1:04:09.500\n And so that's a very delicate question\n\n1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:11.980\n or a very difficult question.\n\n1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:16.220\n And we all have responsibilities to different parties\n\n1:04:16.220 --> 1:04:18.940\n and we all have different levels of knowledge\n\n1:04:18.940 --> 1:04:21.180\n about those particular things.\n\n1:04:21.180 --> 1:04:25.580\n So for example, as an international investor,\n\n1:04:25.580 --> 1:04:28.260\n I have a responsibility to my investors.\n\n1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:33.060\n Those who run companies have a responsibility to theirs\n\n1:04:33.060 --> 1:04:34.540\n of how do they run that.\n\n1:04:34.540 --> 1:04:39.540\n So if you're taking Nike or Snickers and so on\n\n1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:41.500\n and Americans can decide\n\n1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:44.380\n whether they wanna buy Chinese products\n\n1:04:44.380 --> 1:04:46.220\n or not buy Chinese products,\n\n1:04:46.220 --> 1:04:49.420\n we are all faced with those types of choices.\n\n1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:52.380\n So you have what do you wanna do in your constituency\n\n1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:53.660\n and you have your choices.\n\n1:04:53.660 --> 1:04:56.300\n And then beyond that, in many cases,\n\n1:04:56.300 --> 1:04:58.060\n the issues are quite complex,\n\n1:04:58.060 --> 1:05:02.300\n like there are geopolitical questions that enter into it.\n\n1:05:02.300 --> 1:05:07.300\n So, and then I believe that if you disconnected,\n\n1:05:08.700 --> 1:05:13.060\n if all those entities like myself,\n\n1:05:13.060 --> 1:05:17.820\n the businesses doing business with China disconnected,\n\n1:05:17.820 --> 1:05:20.420\n I think that that would be disastrous,\n\n1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:22.340\n economically disastrous.\n\n1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:27.340\n And it would also be reduce the understanding\n\n1:05:27.540 --> 1:05:31.460\n that comes from working together that helps to reduce wars.\n\n1:05:31.460 --> 1:05:33.740\n And so these are all complicated.\n\n1:05:33.740 --> 1:05:38.700\n So what we do is, and who makes it my opinion\n\n1:05:38.700 --> 1:05:39.620\n matters the most?\n\n1:05:39.620 --> 1:05:41.740\n Why should it be my opinion that matters the most\n\n1:05:41.740 --> 1:05:43.220\n in making that decision?\n\n1:05:43.220 --> 1:05:46.740\n So I largely look at the government guidance\n\n1:05:46.740 --> 1:05:49.300\n that I get not only from my own government,\n\n1:05:49.300 --> 1:05:52.220\n but from the other governments and I follow the rules.\n\n1:05:52.220 --> 1:05:55.380\n I'm in 40, we invest in 40 countries.\n\n1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:57.580\n And we wanna do that in the best way\n\n1:05:57.580 --> 1:05:59.980\n to provide the diversified portfolio.\n\n1:05:59.980 --> 1:06:01.780\n And we sort of need that.\n\n1:06:01.780 --> 1:06:06.380\n Every one of those countries has similar complexities.\n\n1:06:06.380 --> 1:06:08.780\n There are always one issue or another,\n\n1:06:08.780 --> 1:06:12.420\n and there's only so much that we really understand\n\n1:06:12.420 --> 1:06:13.700\n about all of those issues.\n\n1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:17.020\n So we rely largely on the guidance that we get.\n\n1:06:17.020 --> 1:06:19.460\n Yeah, you have to empathize and show respect\n\n1:06:19.460 --> 1:06:22.460\n to the culture of the place, the way things are done.\n\n1:06:23.260 --> 1:06:25.020\n You don't necessarily,\n\n1:06:26.740 --> 1:06:30.180\n the way you heal relationships between nations\n\n1:06:30.180 --> 1:06:32.980\n is like you said, you work together.\n\n1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:37.980\n And that requires kind of to listen\n\n1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:40.220\n maybe more than you talk.\n\n1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:42.540\n And I think people in the public sphere\n\n1:06:44.140 --> 1:06:46.580\n talk a lot about China without really listening,\n\n1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:48.300\n without understanding much about China,\n\n1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:50.380\n though one of the things that makes me really sad\n\n1:06:50.380 --> 1:06:52.340\n because I know how to speak Russian\n\n1:06:53.700 --> 1:06:56.700\n and I know how much is lost in translation.\n\n1:06:57.620 --> 1:07:00.220\n It makes me sad that I'll never really get to know\n\n1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:02.940\n the Chinese culture because like,\n\n1:07:02.940 --> 1:07:04.740\n I'll never really get to know the language,\n\n1:07:04.740 --> 1:07:08.020\n the literature, just talk to regular people.\n\n1:07:08.020 --> 1:07:10.580\n It's not just the government or officials or scientists,\n\n1:07:10.580 --> 1:07:12.780\n just regular folks, get the culture.\n\n1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:14.980\n I think if you don't understand the culture,\n\n1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:18.740\n just the basics of the human nature,\n\n1:07:18.740 --> 1:07:21.860\n what people love about their country,\n\n1:07:21.860 --> 1:07:25.340\n about their family or the kind of hopes they have,\n\n1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:26.540\n what kind of values they have,\n\n1:07:26.540 --> 1:07:28.700\n without that you're not gonna be able to\n\n1:07:30.740 --> 1:07:34.060\n fully connect with them.\n\n1:07:34.060 --> 1:07:35.940\n And you have to do that first\n\n1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:37.940\n to have a chance of building a good world.\n\n1:07:37.940 --> 1:07:39.100\n I couldn't agree with you more.\n\n1:07:39.100 --> 1:07:41.780\n I was very lucky because as I say,\n\n1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:46.780\n since 1984, so for more than half of my life,\n\n1:07:47.820 --> 1:07:51.020\n I've been going there and the common people\n\n1:07:51.020 --> 1:07:53.820\n and all sorts of people, and I've got to meet them.\n\n1:07:53.820 --> 1:07:56.220\n I don't speak the language,\n\n1:07:56.220 --> 1:07:59.820\n but a combination of through translators\n\n1:07:59.820 --> 1:08:02.940\n or them speaking English and being in situations.\n\n1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:07.380\n I had my son go to school, a local school,\n\n1:08:07.380 --> 1:08:10.780\n and we developed those kinds of understandings.\n\n1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:15.780\n I think that, but the not wanting\n\n1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:18.820\n to know the other perspective\n\n1:08:20.020 --> 1:08:22.060\n is the thing that's most scary.\n\n1:08:22.060 --> 1:08:24.220\n Like I'm right now in the middle\n\n1:08:24.220 --> 1:08:27.820\n and all I want to try to do\n\n1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:31.740\n is to help mutual understanding.\n\n1:08:31.740 --> 1:08:34.700\n You're right, if there were questions probing me,\n\n1:08:34.700 --> 1:08:36.780\n asking me, what is it?\n\n1:08:36.780 --> 1:08:39.420\n I'm not on one side or another.\n\n1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:41.860\n I don't want to be on one side or another.\n\n1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:44.620\n I believe that each has their right within there\n\n1:08:44.620 --> 1:08:46.980\n to approach their different culture in their own way.\n\n1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:48.900\n So many ways you gave an example.\n\n1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:54.740\n If they're not doing harm to others, I mean,\n\n1:08:54.740 --> 1:08:59.740\n but that issue of trying to understand\n\n1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:03.220\n is so much better.\n\n1:09:03.220 --> 1:09:05.260\n That doesn't mean agree with.\n\n1:09:05.260 --> 1:09:10.260\n If you are wanting to out clever\n\n1:09:11.020 --> 1:09:12.940\n and out compete somebody,\n\n1:09:12.940 --> 1:09:16.980\n it still pays to understand what they're thinking.\n\n1:09:16.980 --> 1:09:20.460\n So to achieve understanding of what they're thinking,\n\n1:09:20.460 --> 1:09:22.180\n even if you want to go to war with them,\n\n1:09:22.180 --> 1:09:25.260\n that understanding is the best thing to have.\n\n1:09:25.260 --> 1:09:28.100\n What we have now is a situation\n\n1:09:28.100 --> 1:09:31.580\n in which there's an enemy mentality.\n\n1:09:31.580 --> 1:09:35.420\n And that means that anything that serves,\n\n1:09:35.420 --> 1:09:39.740\n seems to be like understanding or conveying understanding,\n\n1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:42.540\n seems to mistakenly create the notion\n\n1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:45.340\n of I'm on their side in a war.\n\n1:09:45.340 --> 1:09:47.700\n And that's kind of a dangerous thing\n\n1:09:47.700 --> 1:09:50.860\n because there's a momentum here to fight.\n\n1:09:51.900 --> 1:09:54.620\n Henry Kissinger praises your new book\n\n1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:57.620\n and you thank him in it in the dedication.\n\n1:09:57.620 --> 1:09:59.660\n What's your relationship like with him?\n\n1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:01.540\n What makes him interesting?\n\n1:10:01.540 --> 1:10:03.220\n Maybe what makes him controversial?\n\n1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:05.740\n What makes him such a central figure in history?\n\n1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:10.140\n First, most importantly, he's unique about seeing things\n\n1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:13.580\n through all the others eyes.\n\n1:10:14.660 --> 1:10:18.020\n So if you were, it's like there's a chess game.\n\n1:10:18.020 --> 1:10:22.900\n I mean, I think geopolitics is like a chess game,\n\n1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:26.620\n but with multiple chess players playing the same game.\n\n1:10:26.620 --> 1:10:30.060\n So imagine there are six people around\n\n1:10:30.060 --> 1:10:34.700\n playing the chess game and he could sit in each seat\n\n1:10:34.700 --> 1:10:38.500\n and he could know how they see it, okay?\n\n1:10:38.500 --> 1:10:42.300\n And see it in a calm way of how they see it.\n\n1:10:42.300 --> 1:10:43.740\n He's unique in that way.\n\n1:10:43.740 --> 1:10:48.060\n He's 98 years old and he's equally able to do that.\n\n1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:52.500\n And he has a background in which he's a historian.\n\n1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:57.260\n So he really understands history super terrifically.\n\n1:10:58.860 --> 1:11:02.100\n He doesn't understand economic history as much.\n\n1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:06.340\n So that's why to some extent we enjoy having a conversation\n\n1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:10.260\n because he's interested in the economic piece he doesn't know\n\n1:11:10.260 --> 1:11:13.540\n and I'm so interested in the geopolitical piece\n\n1:11:13.540 --> 1:11:15.060\n that I don't know as well.\n\n1:11:15.060 --> 1:11:16.940\n But anyway, he's able to do that,\n\n1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:21.500\n but not only a historian, but a practitioner.\n\n1:11:21.500 --> 1:11:26.500\n So when you go from an academic to a practitioner\n\n1:11:27.780 --> 1:11:31.860\n who has that talent to see things through others eyes\n\n1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:35.220\n in an objective way and to be strategic\n\n1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:38.940\n rather than just tactical, that's a very special person\n\n1:11:38.940 --> 1:11:43.020\n and that's why Henry is, to me, a very special person.\n\n1:11:43.020 --> 1:11:45.380\n Yeah, he's lived a fascinating life.\n\n1:11:45.380 --> 1:11:49.820\n Just all of the world events he's been involved in\n\n1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:51.780\n is fascinating and like you said,\n\n1:11:51.780 --> 1:11:54.460\n that's such an interesting skill to have\n\n1:11:54.460 --> 1:11:57.260\n to consider what are the concerns, the hope, the dreams,\n\n1:11:57.260 --> 1:11:59.540\n the fears of all the people at the table.\n\n1:11:59.540 --> 1:12:01.240\n What are they thinking?\n\n1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:05.660\n I find that people don't, once again, don't do that enough\n\n1:12:05.660 --> 1:12:07.660\n when it's the obvious thing you should be doing,\n\n1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:12.660\n whether it's business deals or political negotiation\n\n1:12:13.180 --> 1:12:15.380\n or geopolitical negotiation.\n\n1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:18.060\n I'm often surprised, again, sorry to go to the Russian thing\n\n1:12:18.060 --> 1:12:23.060\n because I hear Putin talk in Russian\n\n1:12:23.860 --> 1:12:26.260\n and you start to infer certain intentions,\n\n1:12:26.260 --> 1:12:30.140\n like not the trivial stuff, like the human being.\n\n1:12:30.140 --> 1:12:33.020\n What is that human being hoping for himself,\n\n1:12:33.020 --> 1:12:36.100\n for his country, for his close inner circle,\n\n1:12:36.100 --> 1:12:39.460\n for the bigger, and I just see that\n\n1:12:39.460 --> 1:12:41.460\n that's often just lost in translation.\n\n1:12:41.460 --> 1:12:45.460\n I just see American leaders talking to Putin\n\n1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:48.820\n and it's just not, there's not a connection.\n\n1:12:48.820 --> 1:12:51.980\n Absolutely, I know exactly what you're talking about.\n\n1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:58.580\n It has never failed that in my listening to a conversation\n\n1:12:58.580 --> 1:13:03.580\n or even reading a speech and you see then it reported,\n\n1:13:05.620 --> 1:13:10.620\n inevitably, the reporter picks some headline characterization\n\n1:13:10.620 --> 1:13:15.620\n that has very little to do with what was really happening\n\n1:13:16.380 --> 1:13:19.100\n but might be a headline grabber\n\n1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:20.980\n that's at some kind of distortion\n\n1:13:20.980 --> 1:13:22.860\n and there's a lack of understanding\n\n1:13:22.860 --> 1:13:25.180\n of really what's going on.\n\n1:13:25.180 --> 1:13:27.540\n If it's okay, let me ask you a couple questions\n\n1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:28.840\n about cryptocurrency.\n\n1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:32.700\n You've had a few opinions about Bitcoin over the years.\n\n1:13:32.700 --> 1:13:34.900\n What are your thoughts about Bitcoin today,\n\n1:13:34.900 --> 1:13:38.380\n its role in the global financial system\n\n1:13:38.380 --> 1:13:41.420\n and just in human society in general?\n\n1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:44.340\n Well, the evolution of Bitcoin over the years\n\n1:13:44.340 --> 1:13:49.340\n is one of the things that has influenced changes in my view.\n\n1:13:51.660 --> 1:13:56.660\n It has proven itself something like 10, 11 years ago.\n\n1:13:57.460 --> 1:14:01.260\n Imagine the programming of this and you throw it out\n\n1:14:01.260 --> 1:14:02.800\n and that's the idea.\n\n1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:04.820\n It has not been hacked.\n\n1:14:04.820 --> 1:14:09.660\n It has operated, it has built,\n\n1:14:09.660 --> 1:14:14.380\n it has come an amazing way over that 11 years\n\n1:14:14.380 --> 1:14:19.380\n to be maybe probably the most excited topic\n\n1:14:19.860 --> 1:14:23.700\n among a lot of people and has been used\n\n1:14:23.700 --> 1:14:28.700\n and is now has obtained the status of having imputed value.\n\n1:14:28.700 --> 1:14:32.880\n At the same time, it is one of those assets\n\n1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:35.080\n that is an alternative money.\n\n1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:37.640\n I think we're entering an era\n\n1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:42.080\n where there's going to be a competition of monies.\n\n1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:46.520\n Because of the printing of fiat money\n\n1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:50.560\n and the depreciated value,\n\n1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:53.080\n there will be a competition of monies\n\n1:14:54.040 --> 1:14:57.520\n and Bitcoin is part of that competition.\n\n1:14:57.520 --> 1:15:00.880\n But there'll be many monies, not just crypto monies,\n\n1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.560\n but there'll be central bank crypto monies,\n\n1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:07.240\n but there'll be different kinds of monies.\n\n1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:12.760\n And even monies are things that you buy and sell.\n\n1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:16.720\n NFTs can become a type of money.\n\n1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:18.360\n You own it and it's an investment\n\n1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:22.560\n and you could say I'd rather own it than own Bitcoin.\n\n1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.240\n Has Ray Dalio bought any NFTs?\n\n1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:26.080\n Not yet.\n\n1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:31.080\n But only just because I definitely want to buy NFTs\n\n1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:36.920\n to just experience them.\n\n1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:40.680\n Like I think I should produce one and I should.\n\n1:15:40.680 --> 1:15:41.520\n I should have asked that.\n\n1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.800\n Have you minted an NFT?\n\n1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:45.720\n You probably should just to know what it's like.\n\n1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:46.600\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:48.200\n This stuff is happening.\n\n1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:51.920\n This stuff is real and how it operates.\n\n1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:56.920\n But like all new real things, some are gonna go\n\n1:15:57.320 --> 1:16:00.100\n and some are gonna, it's like in the internet\n\n1:16:00.100 --> 1:16:05.100\n in the year 2000, pets.com could have been a great,\n\n1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:08.280\n but maybe pets.com doesn't make it and who knows.\n\n1:16:08.280 --> 1:16:10.960\n That's the beauty of the competitive system\n\n1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:13.280\n that it'll evolve and some things will be treasured\n\n1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.400\n and some things will be trashed.\n\n1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:21.780\n But when I look at it, I think we are in an environment\n\n1:16:21.780 --> 1:16:23.840\n of what is an alternative money?\n\n1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:27.000\n A money has two purposes, a medium of exchange\n\n1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.160\n and a storehold of wealth.\n\n1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:33.720\n And we are looking for, and it's portable.\n\n1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:38.020\n And it's best if it's recognized in other countries.\n\n1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:41.840\n So gold is one of those.\n\n1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:46.560\n So I look at it as an alternative gold,\n\n1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:49.640\n but I look at a number of things as alternative gold.\n\n1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:54.640\n And I think that, and gold is still my favorite\n\n1:16:54.840 --> 1:16:56.920\n because of certain qualities.\n\n1:16:56.920 --> 1:16:59.520\n For example, you can't trace it.\n\n1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.400\n In Bitcoin, you can trace who owns it,\n\n1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:04.080\n where it's going and so on.\n\n1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:07.460\n Governments can't have that ability to trace it and so on.\n\n1:17:07.460 --> 1:17:10.800\n A gold piece of coin, it's not connected.\n\n1:17:10.800 --> 1:17:13.000\n I think not connected has benefits,\n\n1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.280\n particularly in a world where maybe connections\n\n1:17:16.280 --> 1:17:17.660\n can be more risky.\n\n1:17:17.660 --> 1:17:22.660\n And then also gold has been for many thousands of years\n\n1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:28.420\n universally recognized as a source of money.\n\n1:17:28.420 --> 1:17:33.380\n And central banks, it's the third largest source of money\n\n1:17:33.380 --> 1:17:35.500\n in central bank reserves.\n\n1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:38.360\n And I don't think Bitcoin is going to serve\n\n1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.420\n those types of purposes and so on.\n\n1:17:40.420 --> 1:17:44.060\n So for various reasons, I prefer gold to the other,\n\n1:17:44.060 --> 1:17:46.940\n but it's a little bit part of my mix.\n\n1:17:46.940 --> 1:17:50.420\n But then you look at it, it hit, I think 69,000 this year\n\n1:17:50.420 --> 1:17:52.780\n is the high Bitcoin hit.\n\n1:17:52.780 --> 1:17:55.640\n Do you think it's possible, you mentioned gold,\n\n1:17:55.640 --> 1:17:59.260\n do you think it's possible it reaches very high numbers,\n\n1:17:59.260 --> 1:18:02.380\n like one million that some people talk about?\n\n1:18:02.380 --> 1:18:06.020\n I don't think that's possible because the way I look at it\n\n1:18:06.020 --> 1:18:11.020\n is there's a certain amount of it.\n\n1:18:11.020 --> 1:18:16.020\n A certain amount of it, and there's a certain amount of gold.\n\n1:18:18.060 --> 1:18:19.800\n I'll use gold as a benchmark.\n\n1:18:21.340 --> 1:18:26.340\n The amount of it is worth about $1 trillion.\n\n1:18:26.780 --> 1:18:29.740\n Total crypto is about 2.2 trillion.\n\n1:18:29.740 --> 1:18:33.700\n But let's say Bitcoin, it's $1 trillion.\n\n1:18:33.700 --> 1:18:37.740\n If you take the amount of money that is in gold\n\n1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:42.380\n that is not used for jewelry purposes\n\n1:18:42.380 --> 1:18:45.020\n and not used by central banks,\n\n1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.380\n and I assume Bitcoin won't be used for jewelry purposes\n\n1:18:48.380 --> 1:18:50.140\n or central bank purposes,\n\n1:18:51.260 --> 1:18:54.220\n that amount in gold is about $5 trillion.\n\n1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:59.160\n So right now, if you were to have a portfolio\n\n1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:03.980\n that has gold and crypto, gold and Bitcoin,\n\n1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:07.540\n it's worth about 20% of the value of gold.\n\n1:19:07.540 --> 1:19:12.540\n Do I think it's going to be worth more than gold\n\n1:19:12.580 --> 1:19:14.220\n in terms of that mix?\n\n1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:16.900\n I don't think it'll be worth more than gold.\n\n1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:21.340\n But let's say it became worth as much as gold.\n\n1:19:21.340 --> 1:19:22.740\n I don't believe it will be.\n\n1:19:22.740 --> 1:19:25.660\n I think that 20% sounds kind of about right.\n\n1:19:25.660 --> 1:19:28.000\n I really don't know what the right answer is.\n\n1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:32.780\n And then there's the question of what is all of that pool\n\n1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:36.220\n of money that let's say gold and gold equivalents\n\n1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:37.600\n relative to everything else?\n\n1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.100\n Does it go from, let's call it\n\n1:19:41.940 --> 1:19:44.740\n six, seven, eight trillion to 16 trillion?\n\n1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:46.140\n Maybe it could double.\n\n1:19:46.140 --> 1:19:48.740\n It depends what it is in the world environment.\n\n1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:51.760\n But basically, if you use gold as a measure,\n\n1:19:54.220 --> 1:19:56.260\n it just makes no sense\n\n1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:00.440\n that it's going to be used that much more.\n\n1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:01.760\n Am I sure about that?\n\n1:20:01.760 --> 1:20:03.340\n I'm not sure about anything.\n\n1:20:03.340 --> 1:20:07.900\n But logically, it seems to me that there's a limitation\n\n1:20:07.900 --> 1:20:11.300\n on its price in relationship to other things\n\n1:20:11.300 --> 1:20:12.260\n that are like it.\n\n1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:15.820\n Let me ask for your deep financial analysis\n\n1:20:15.820 --> 1:20:17.500\n on a very important issue.\n\n1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:20.380\n I just talked a couple days ago with Elon Musk.\n\n1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:23.700\n He wants to put a literal Dogecoin on the moon.\n\n1:20:23.700 --> 1:20:25.760\n What are your thoughts about Dogecoin?\n\n1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:30.940\n And do you think it'll be the official currency?\n\n1:20:30.940 --> 1:20:35.140\n How many be reserve currency on the moon and on Mars?\n\n1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:37.540\n My reaction is that's cute.\n\n1:20:37.540 --> 1:20:40.300\n I remember Elon when he first got,\n\n1:20:40.300 --> 1:20:42.520\n he first got his money from PayPal.\n\n1:20:42.520 --> 1:20:45.460\n I think he said to me it was,\n\n1:20:45.460 --> 1:20:48.140\n he got $180 million, $90 million.\n\n1:20:48.140 --> 1:20:52.460\n He decided to say, why aren't we going to outer space?\n\n1:20:52.460 --> 1:20:57.460\n And he wanted to take a spaceship that would be modified\n\n1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:02.460\n using Russian technology to put a plant\n\n1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:10.820\n and a watering can on the moon or on Mars, I think it was.\n\n1:21:14.780 --> 1:21:17.660\n And he said, first life on Mars,\n\n1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:22.660\n or first life on that as an inspiring notion.\n\n1:21:23.820 --> 1:21:27.300\n And so then there's always what's behind it.\n\n1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:31.380\n I have a lot of respect for Elon's ability\n\n1:21:31.380 --> 1:21:34.220\n to do other things behind it.\n\n1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:38.020\n And so I would take that as symbolic\n\n1:21:38.020 --> 1:21:41.420\n and I'd be asking him what's behind it, what's next.\n\n1:21:41.420 --> 1:21:44.820\n And I'm also just on the topic of Dogecoin and memecoin\n\n1:21:44.820 --> 1:21:48.420\n and there's some aspect of humor and lightheartedness\n\n1:21:48.420 --> 1:21:52.380\n that's really interesting about the way we communicate,\n\n1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:54.100\n what ideas become viral,\n\n1:21:54.100 --> 1:21:57.940\n how to captivate people with ideas.\n\n1:21:57.940 --> 1:22:00.060\n There's something about taking things too seriously\n\n1:22:00.060 --> 1:22:02.820\n that somehow slows it all down and it's interesting.\n\n1:22:02.820 --> 1:22:03.700\n You're right.\n\n1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:05.300\n That's part of human nature somehow.\n\n1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:07.720\n So like humor is part of this whole thing.\n\n1:22:09.900 --> 1:22:13.500\n You've talked about the importance of writing ideas down\n\n1:22:14.340 --> 1:22:15.660\n and you have a fascinating.\n\n1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:17.260\n Principles in particular.\n\n1:22:17.260 --> 1:22:18.340\n Principles.\n\n1:22:18.340 --> 1:22:20.920\n And you have this really nice thing in your book\n\n1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:24.580\n where you actually, I mean there's such a brilliant way.\n\n1:22:26.140 --> 1:22:28.980\n You have such a brilliant way of highlighting\n\n1:22:28.980 --> 1:22:33.500\n which parts are extra important and you make them bold.\n\n1:22:33.500 --> 1:22:34.700\n That's a brilliant idea.\n\n1:22:34.700 --> 1:22:36.380\n But let me just ask the high level question\n\n1:22:36.380 --> 1:22:41.380\n of what's a good system for taking notes?\n\n1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:45.560\n Well, I find that almost everything happens\n\n1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:46.800\n over and over again.\n\n1:22:46.800 --> 1:22:51.800\n And we're in the blizzard of these things happening.\n\n1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:56.760\n And what I found is that if I'm making a decision\n\n1:22:58.280 --> 1:23:02.160\n that after I make the decision usually\n\n1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.600\n or write at the time,\n\n1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:08.600\n if I pause and reflect and I write my principle down,\n\n1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:12.300\n in other words, principle is sort of a recipe,\n\n1:23:12.300 --> 1:23:16.560\n what would I use to, how would I make that decision?\n\n1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:18.560\n And what are the criteria around it?\n\n1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:23.200\n I find that I make it much more clear, it becomes clearer\n\n1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:26.480\n and it applies to the next thing that comes along,\n\n1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:28.040\n it'll be that way.\n\n1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:30.880\n Because everything happens over and over and over again\n\n1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:33.200\n and I think people make the mistake\n\n1:23:33.200 --> 1:23:37.080\n of looking at just the one like it's the first one.\n\n1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:40.120\n I don't know, they have the first problem of this sort\n\n1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:42.160\n or the first child or whatever it is.\n\n1:23:42.160 --> 1:23:44.680\n And this has been happening plenty of times.\n\n1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:46.600\n And so if you have the principles,\n\n1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:50.640\n I found that that helped me think more clearly about it\n\n1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:54.400\n and it helped me communicate better, like why.\n\n1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:58.900\n And so over the years, over the last 30 years or so,\n\n1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:00.140\n that's what I've done.\n\n1:24:00.140 --> 1:24:02.740\n I did it originally to communicate very well\n\n1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:04.880\n with the people I work with.\n\n1:24:04.880 --> 1:24:07.880\n I set up my company and it was very important\n\n1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:09.040\n to have good communication.\n\n1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:11.520\n And then we could debate the principles\n\n1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:14.000\n and so that's the process.\n\n1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.680\n I urge people to do that.\n\n1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:19.160\n There are many excellent decision makers\n\n1:24:20.080 --> 1:24:23.460\n and I just wish that they wrote down their principles.\n\n1:24:23.460 --> 1:24:27.580\n When this set, so for example,\n\n1:24:27.580 --> 1:24:30.580\n we talk about Henry Kissinger and his new book\n\n1:24:30.580 --> 1:24:32.840\n is gonna come out with a book on leadership.\n\n1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:37.000\n And don't just describe the leaders,\n\n1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:41.140\n describe then what about them were the essential elements\n\n1:24:41.140 --> 1:24:44.440\n to make a good leader under what circumstances.\n\n1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.000\n And so if we think about that,\n\n1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.720\n then also then you begin to think in a principled way.\n\n1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:55.200\n And then when you start to think in a principled way,\n\n1:24:55.200 --> 1:24:58.760\n life becomes, it's so much easier to make decisions\n\n1:24:58.760 --> 1:25:01.040\n and it's so much less confusing\n\n1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:04.120\n because it's like coming up on a species\n\n1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:08.020\n and you say, okay, well, what species is it?\n\n1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:10.600\n Not just another, it's a thing.\n\n1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:12.360\n No, what species is it\n\n1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:15.880\n and how do I deal with that species effectively?\n\n1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:17.800\n And so that's what that is.\n\n1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:20.300\n And so I encourage people to write it down.\n\n1:25:20.300 --> 1:25:24.240\n I wish anybody who's successful wrote down their principles\n\n1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:27.440\n or their recipes for making those types of decisions.\n\n1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:30.720\n So the events of interest here happens\n\n1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:33.520\n over and over and over in similar ways.\n\n1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:34.920\n As you're looking for the patterns\n\n1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:36.720\n and you're defining the process,\n\n1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:40.400\n that's right to respond to those patterns\n\n1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:42.920\n and you call that the principles\n\n1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:46.480\n and that allows you to deal with the future effectively.\n\n1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:49.800\n So like that codifies the lessons from the past\n\n1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:51.740\n to be able to deal with the future.\n\n1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:55.520\n What advice do you have for young folks today?\n\n1:25:55.520 --> 1:25:59.020\n In high school, in college, thinking about how to live,\n\n1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:02.480\n have a career they can be proud of\n\n1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:05.320\n or maybe have a life they can be proud of?\n\n1:26:05.320 --> 1:26:09.320\n Know yourself, follow your passion,\n\n1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:12.640\n make your work and passion the same thing\n\n1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:15.280\n while considering the money part\n\n1:26:15.280 --> 1:26:18.400\n because money will get you freedom and choice\n\n1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:19.480\n and be able to bank that.\n\n1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:24.160\n But if you know yourself, feel the pull\n\n1:26:27.120 --> 1:26:28.580\n and pursue that passion.\n\n1:26:29.880 --> 1:26:32.000\n And along those lines, by the way,\n\n1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:36.720\n I found that using personality profile tests\n\n1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:38.180\n has been very helpful.\n\n1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:40.560\n I've used those for about 25 years\n\n1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:42.940\n for people to help to understand themselves\n\n1:26:42.940 --> 1:26:43.920\n and understand each other.\n\n1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:48.920\n So I created a free one that is called Principles You.\n\n1:26:49.180 --> 1:26:50.320\n It's online.\n\n1:26:51.220 --> 1:26:56.220\n It's had remarkable, loving people who've taken it,\n\n1:26:57.360 --> 1:26:58.440\n learn about themselves,\n\n1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:01.240\n but also you can put in somebody else\n\n1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:04.120\n and it'll tell you about your relationship with them.\n\n1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:06.820\n That's like 30 minutes is a quick discovery,\n\n1:27:06.820 --> 1:27:10.760\n but the main thing is to understand on your journey,\n\n1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:15.760\n your hero's journey that you will have mistakes\n\n1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:19.320\n and you will have weaknesses\n\n1:27:19.320 --> 1:27:24.320\n and to understand those, not fight those\n\n1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:28.560\n because by understanding mistakes,\n\n1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:31.080\n you will learn not to make mistakes again.\n\n1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:35.400\n I have a principle which is pain plus reflection\n\n1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:37.320\n equals progress.\n\n1:27:37.320 --> 1:27:41.240\n And so that reflection is important to know yourself,\n\n1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:44.360\n know your pulls, know your weaknesses.\n\n1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:46.920\n And when you also know your weaknesses\n\n1:27:46.920 --> 1:27:48.940\n and the strengths of other people,\n\n1:27:48.940 --> 1:27:52.480\n there are people who have strengths where you're weak\n\n1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:54.440\n and you have strengths where they're weak.\n\n1:27:54.440 --> 1:27:57.240\n And to be able to work well together\n\n1:27:57.240 --> 1:28:02.240\n is the most effective way of achieving success.\n\n1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:05.000\n So yeah, it's that journey.\n\n1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:08.320\n And there's a life arc and there's a journey\n\n1:28:08.320 --> 1:28:11.360\n and you wanna make it the best that you can make it.\n\n1:28:11.360 --> 1:28:15.280\n And it's like a video game.\n\n1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:19.500\n It has the challenges and the obstacles\n\n1:28:19.500 --> 1:28:22.920\n and the learning experiences and the temptations\n\n1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:24.040\n and all of that.\n\n1:28:24.040 --> 1:28:28.180\n And the maximizing learning to go where you wanna go\n\n1:28:28.180 --> 1:28:31.560\n to achieve the life you want is the most important.\n\n1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:34.320\n That's kind of maybe a long winded way of saying it,\n\n1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:39.320\n but to learn, I think I'll try to say it simply.\n\n1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:41.360\n There's a five step process.\n\n1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:46.360\n Step one is know your goals, know what you're going after.\n\n1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.280\n You could have almost anything you want,\n\n1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:52.400\n but you can't have everything you want.\n\n1:28:52.400 --> 1:28:56.120\n And so you have to prioritize and you move in that direction.\n\n1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:57.360\n On the way to your goals,\n\n1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:01.100\n you're going to encounter your problems and your obstacles.\n\n1:29:01.100 --> 1:29:05.680\n So step two is understanding your problems\n\n1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:07.720\n and your obstacles, identify them.\n\n1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:10.740\n Step three is to diagnose them\n\n1:29:10.740 --> 1:29:13.900\n to get at the root cause of the problem.\n\n1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:16.560\n And that could be many root causes,\n\n1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:19.720\n but it could also be your weaknesses or weaknesses of others,\n\n1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:22.160\n but you have to be objective about them.\n\n1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:26.080\n Once you diagnose them, then you go to step four,\n\n1:29:26.080 --> 1:29:29.200\n which is to design a way to get around them.\n\n1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:33.940\n And then after you have that design,\n\n1:29:33.940 --> 1:29:35.720\n you implement that design.\n\n1:29:35.720 --> 1:29:38.200\n So you have to follow through and do it.\n\n1:29:38.200 --> 1:29:42.920\n And you do that, and that will then produce its new results,\n\n1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:44.780\n which should be better results.\n\n1:29:44.780 --> 1:29:47.680\n I call this kind of a looping process.\n\n1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:50.240\n It's the evolutionary looping process.\n\n1:29:50.240 --> 1:29:53.380\n And you just keep doing that\n\n1:29:53.380 --> 1:29:55.140\n and you learn over a period of time\n\n1:29:55.140 --> 1:29:57.660\n and you move in the direction that you want.\n\n1:29:57.660 --> 1:30:01.260\n Last question, and you only have one minute to answer.\n\n1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.040\n You dedicate the book, quote,\n\n1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:08.660\n \"'To my grandchildren and those of their generation\n\n1:30:08.660 --> 1:30:09.840\n \"'who will be participants\n\n1:30:09.840 --> 1:30:12.880\n \"'in the continuation of this story.\n\n1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:15.760\n \"'May the force of evolution be with you.'\"\n\n1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:18.480\n So let me ask, where's this force of evolution\n\n1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:20.520\n taking human civilization?\n\n1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:24.720\n And what in this story that evolution is writing\n\n1:30:24.720 --> 1:30:26.560\n gives you hope?\n\n1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:30.640\n Evolution is a direction toward improvement.\n\n1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:37.000\n And the greatest force is man's capacity to adapt and invent.\n\n1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:42.960\n And so you see in the charts in the book,\n\n1:30:42.960 --> 1:30:47.960\n you see that this upward movement, life expectancy,\n\n1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:55.200\n health, all the things that we think are better,\n\n1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:57.120\n you see there's a chart\n\n1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:59.280\n and it shows that over a period of time\n\n1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:02.960\n and you barely see the downturns\n\n1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:05.980\n from depressions and wars in that.\n\n1:31:05.980 --> 1:31:08.080\n That is the greatest power.\n\n1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:13.080\n Man's ability to invent and adapt is evolution\n\n1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:15.400\n and that's the greatest power\n\n1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:20.040\n and that is what gives me justifiable hope.\n\n1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:23.160\n And a continuation of that, like we mentioned with Elon,\n\n1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:25.720\n maybe we'll become a multi planetary species.\n\n1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.600\n So not only will we keep creating amazing things\n\n1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:31.840\n here on Earth, we'll keep expanding out into the cosmos.\n\n1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:36.600\n My time horizon isn't gonna have me analyzing that yet,\n\n1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:41.600\n but I hope so and I agree that that would be\n\n1:31:41.720 --> 1:31:42.560\n in the next.\n\n1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:43.400\n So I'm not gonna ask you\n\n1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:46.160\n for the best financial system on Mars.\n\n1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:47.960\n I think we'll focus on Earth for now.\n\n1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:49.720\n Ray, thank you so much for your brilliance,\n\n1:31:49.720 --> 1:31:51.240\n for the books you've written,\n\n1:31:51.240 --> 1:31:52.160\n for the works you've done,\n\n1:31:52.160 --> 1:31:54.560\n for the inspiration of millions.\n\n1:31:54.560 --> 1:31:57.360\n And thank you for spending your valuable time\n\n1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:58.440\n here with me today.\n\n1:31:58.440 --> 1:31:59.960\n Thank you.\n\n1:31:59.960 --> 1:32:02.720\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray Dalio.\n\n1:32:02.720 --> 1:32:04.120\n To support this podcast,\n\n1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:06.880\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:08.960\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n1:32:08.960 --> 1:32:11.360\n from Ray Dalio himself.\n\n1:32:11.360 --> 1:32:13.960\n Every time you confront something painful,\n\n1:32:13.960 --> 1:32:17.160\n you are at a potentially important juncture in your life.\n\n1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:19.320\n You have the opportunity to choose healthy\n\n1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:24.320\n and painful truth or unhealthy but comfortable delusion.\n\n1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:51.320\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
