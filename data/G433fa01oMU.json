Columbia.\n\n00:08.120 --> 00:10.840\n Vincent is one of the best educators in biology\n\n00:10.840 --> 00:12.520\n and in general that I've ever had\n\n00:12.520 --> 00:14.360\n the pleasure of speaking with.\n\n00:14.360 --> 00:16.120\n I highly recommend you check out\n\n00:16.120 --> 00:19.040\n his This Week in Virology podcast\n\n00:19.040 --> 00:22.520\n and watch his introductory lectures on YouTube.\n\n00:22.520 --> 00:24.920\n In particular, the playlist I recommend\n\n00:24.920 --> 00:28.720\n is called Virology Lectures 2021.\n\n00:28.720 --> 00:30.040\n To support this podcast,\n\n00:30.040 --> 00:32.720\n please check out the sponsors in the description.\n\n00:33.640 --> 00:35.800\n As a side note, please allow me to say\n\n00:35.800 --> 00:38.320\n a few words about the COVID vaccines.\n\n00:38.320 --> 00:41.000\n Some people are scared of a virus hurting\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:43.280\n or killing somebody they love.\n\n00:43.280 --> 00:46.720\n Some are scared of their government betraying them,\n\n00:46.720 --> 00:49.520\n their leaders blinded by power and greed.\n\n00:50.360 --> 00:52.160\n I have both of these fears.\n\n00:52.160 --> 00:57.160\n And two, I'm afraid, as FDR said, of fear itself.\n\n00:57.160 --> 01:01.120\n Fear manifests as anger and anger leads to division\n\n01:01.120 --> 01:03.200\n in the hands of charismatic leaders\n\n01:03.200 --> 01:06.600\n who then manufacture truth in quotes\n\n01:06.600 --> 01:10.160\n that maximize controversy and a sense of imminent crisis\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:12.160\n that only they can save us from.\n\n01:13.160 --> 01:15.920\n And though I'm sometimes mocked for this,\n\n01:15.920 --> 01:20.520\n I still believe that love, compassion, empathy\n\n01:20.520 --> 01:24.240\n is the way out from this vicious downward spiral of division.\n\n01:24.240 --> 01:26.240\n I personally took the vaccine\n\n01:26.240 --> 01:28.520\n based on my understanding of the data,\n\n01:28.520 --> 01:30.880\n deciding that for me, the risk of negative effects\n\n01:30.880 --> 01:33.840\n from COVID, short term and long term,\n\n01:33.840 --> 01:36.200\n are far worse than the negative effects\n\n01:36.200 --> 01:38.640\n from the mRNA vaccine.\n\n01:38.640 --> 01:43.480\n I read, I thought, I decided, for me.\n\n01:43.480 --> 01:47.280\n But I never have and never will talk down to people\n\n01:47.280 --> 01:49.160\n who don't take the vaccine.\n\n01:49.160 --> 01:52.480\n I'm humble enough to know just how little I know,\n\n01:52.480 --> 01:55.480\n how wrong I have been and will be\n\n01:55.480 --> 01:58.160\n on many of my beliefs and ideas.\n\n01:58.160 --> 02:01.080\n I think dogmatic certainty and division\n\n02:01.080 --> 02:04.720\n is more destructive in the long term than any virus.\n\n02:04.720 --> 02:07.520\n The solution for me personally, like I said,\n\n02:07.520 --> 02:09.600\n is to choose empathy and compassion\n\n02:09.600 --> 02:12.360\n towards all fellow human beings,\n\n02:12.360 --> 02:14.760\n no matter who they voted for.\n\n02:14.760 --> 02:16.400\n I hope you do the same.\n\n02:16.400 --> 02:19.880\n Read, think, and try to imagine\n\n02:19.880 --> 02:22.840\n that what you currently think is the truth\n\n02:22.840 --> 02:24.760\n may be totally wrong.\n\n02:24.760 --> 02:27.760\n This mindset is one that opens you to discovery,\n\n02:27.760 --> 02:29.520\n innovation, and wisdom.\n\n02:30.400 --> 02:33.040\n I hope my conversation with Vincent Racanello\n\n02:33.040 --> 02:36.080\n is a useful resource for just this kind of exploration.\n\n02:36.080 --> 02:37.920\n He doesn't talk down to people\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:40.400\n and he's the most knowledgeable virologist\n\n02:40.400 --> 02:42.040\n I've ever spoken to.\n\n02:42.040 --> 02:43.960\n He has no political agenda,\n\n02:43.960 --> 02:47.200\n no desire to mock those who disagree with him.\n\n02:47.200 --> 02:49.000\n He just loves biology\n\n02:49.000 --> 02:51.280\n and explaining the fundamental mechanisms\n\n02:51.280 --> 02:54.040\n of how biological systems work.\n\n02:54.040 --> 02:55.720\n That's a great person to listen to\n\n02:55.720 --> 02:58.040\n and learn from with an open mind.\n\n02:58.040 --> 02:59.880\n I hope you join me in doing so,\n\n02:59.880 --> 03:01.120\n and no matter what,\n\n03:01.120 --> 03:03.760\n try to put more love out there in the world.\n\n03:04.720 --> 03:06.560\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast\n\n03:06.560 --> 03:10.000\n and here is my conversation with Vincent Racanello.\n\n03:11.280 --> 03:14.480\n You mentioned in one of your lectures on virology\n\n03:14.480 --> 03:16.040\n that there are more viruses\n\n03:16.040 --> 03:17.880\n in a leader of coastal seawater\n\n03:17.880 --> 03:19.600\n than people on earth.\n\n03:20.560 --> 03:25.560\n In the Nature article titled Microbiology by Numbers,\n\n03:25.560 --> 03:29.600\n it says there are 10 to the 31 viruses on earth.\n\n03:29.600 --> 03:33.600\n Also it says that the rate of viral infection\n\n03:33.600 --> 03:38.600\n in the ocean stands at 10 to the 23 infections per second.\n\n03:39.200 --> 03:42.440\n And these infections remove 20 to 40%\n\n03:42.440 --> 03:45.160\n of all bacterial cells each day.\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:47.200\n There's a war going on.\n\n03:47.200 --> 03:49.360\n Do you, what do you make of these numbers?\n\n03:49.360 --> 03:52.400\n Or why are there so many viruses?\n\n03:52.400 --> 03:54.600\n So the numbers you're quoting,\n\n03:54.600 --> 03:57.920\n they're in my first virology lecture, right?\n\n03:57.920 --> 04:00.720\n Because people don't know these numbers\n\n04:00.720 --> 04:02.560\n and they get, whoa, they get wild by them.\n\n04:02.560 --> 04:04.160\n So I love to give them.\n\n04:04.160 --> 04:06.280\n So the way, sorry to interrupt.\n\n04:06.280 --> 04:08.680\n As I was saying offline,\n\n04:08.680 --> 04:12.320\n you have one of the best introductory lectures on virology\n\n04:12.320 --> 04:14.760\n that I've ever seen, introductory lectures, period.\n\n04:14.760 --> 04:16.680\n So I highly recommend people\n\n04:16.680 --> 04:18.440\n find you on YouTube and watch it\n\n04:18.440 --> 04:20.480\n if you're curious at all about viruses.\n\n04:20.480 --> 04:24.920\n It, yeah, there's a lot of times throughout watching it,\n\n04:24.920 --> 04:26.480\n I felt like, whoa.\n\n04:26.480 --> 04:28.280\n Yeah, that's my goal is to work.\n\n04:28.280 --> 04:29.800\n And that's what my students tell me.\n\n04:29.800 --> 04:33.240\n One student once said, every day after every lecture,\n\n04:33.240 --> 04:35.960\n I could go home and tell my roommate something\n\n04:35.960 --> 04:38.840\n she didn't know and blew her away.\n\n04:38.840 --> 04:42.080\n So the number of viruses is really an amazing number.\n\n04:42.080 --> 04:45.200\n So that number 10 to the 31 is actually\n\n04:45.200 --> 04:48.800\n just the bacterial viruses in the ocean.\n\n04:48.800 --> 04:50.880\n So there are viruses that infect everything\n\n04:50.880 --> 04:52.400\n on the planet, including bacteria.\n\n04:52.400 --> 04:54.720\n There are a lot of bacteria in the ocean.\n\n04:54.720 --> 04:58.280\n And so 10 to the 31 is from basically particle counts\n\n04:58.280 --> 05:00.200\n of seawater all over the world.\n\n05:00.200 --> 05:02.560\n So there are more viruses than 10 to the 31,\n\n05:02.560 --> 05:04.240\n but just in the ocean.\n\n05:04.240 --> 05:06.920\n And that number is so big.\n\n05:06.920 --> 05:10.320\n First of all, the mass exceeds that of elephants\n\n05:10.320 --> 05:12.040\n on the planet by a thousand fold.\n\n05:12.040 --> 05:15.840\n And if you lined up those viruses end to end,\n\n05:15.840 --> 05:19.720\n they would go 200 million light years into space.\n\n05:19.720 --> 05:21.600\n It's so big a number.\n\n05:21.600 --> 05:23.000\n It's amazing.\n\n05:23.000 --> 05:27.560\n And then yes, 10 to the 20 some infections per second\n\n05:27.560 --> 05:30.240\n of these viruses killing bacteria\n\n05:30.240 --> 05:32.680\n and releasing all this organic matter.\n\n05:32.680 --> 05:35.040\n And that's part of this, what we call\n\n05:35.040 --> 05:39.680\n the biogeochemical pump, cycling of material in the ocean.\n\n05:39.680 --> 05:42.600\n The bacteria die, they start to sink\n\n05:42.600 --> 05:45.120\n and then they get metabolized\n\n05:45.120 --> 05:48.200\n and converted to compounds that are needed.\n\n05:48.200 --> 05:50.960\n A lot of it gets released as carbon dioxide and so forth.\n\n05:50.960 --> 05:52.800\n So these are actually really important cycles\n\n05:52.800 --> 05:54.480\n that are catalyzed by the virus.\n\n05:54.480 --> 05:56.320\n Well, it's so wild that nature has developed\n\n05:56.320 --> 05:59.680\n a mechanism for mass murder of bacteria.\n\n05:59.680 --> 06:00.840\n That's one way to look at it,\n\n06:00.840 --> 06:02.840\n but it's just what happened, right?\n\n06:02.840 --> 06:03.680\n It's interesting.\n\n06:03.680 --> 06:06.400\n I mean, I wonder what the evolutionary advantage\n\n06:06.400 --> 06:10.800\n of like such fast cycling of life is.\n\n06:10.800 --> 06:13.360\n Is it just an accident of evolution\n\n06:13.360 --> 06:16.200\n that viruses are so numerous\n\n06:16.200 --> 06:20.800\n or is it a feature and not a bug?\n\n06:20.800 --> 06:25.320\n So the fast is, it's not all fast.\n\n06:25.320 --> 06:26.640\n Not all viruses are fast.\n\n06:26.640 --> 06:28.720\n Some are 20 minutes per cycle.\n\n06:28.720 --> 06:33.720\n Some take weeks per cycle, but that's just per second.\n\n06:33.720 --> 06:35.640\n There's so many viruses in the ocean\n\n06:35.640 --> 06:36.920\n that that's what you get per second,\n\n06:36.920 --> 06:39.280\n no matter how fast the cycle is.\n\n06:39.280 --> 06:41.760\n But I look at it this way.\n\n06:41.760 --> 06:46.000\n Viruses were probably the first organic entities\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:48.200\n to evolve on the planet.\n\n06:48.200 --> 06:50.840\n Long ago, billion years ago,\n\n06:50.840 --> 06:52.080\n just as the earth cooled\n\n06:52.080 --> 06:55.480\n and organic molecules began to form,\n\n06:55.480 --> 07:00.480\n I think these self, we call them self replicators.\n\n07:00.480 --> 07:02.720\n They're just short things that today,\n\n07:02.720 --> 07:07.720\n would look like RNA, which is the basis of many viruses.\n\n07:07.720 --> 07:09.960\n They evolved and they were able to replicate.\n\n07:09.960 --> 07:12.400\n Of course, they were just naked molecules.\n\n07:12.400 --> 07:16.320\n They had no protection and it was just RNA based.\n\n07:16.320 --> 07:20.560\n And that's tough because RNA is pretty fragile in the world.\n\n07:20.560 --> 07:24.760\n And it probably didn't get very big as a consequence.\n\n07:24.760 --> 07:28.920\n But then proteins evolved and I'm skipping like hundreds\n\n07:28.920 --> 07:30.400\n of millions of years of evolution.\n\n07:30.400 --> 07:35.400\n Proteins evolved, maybe without a cell, maybe with a cell.\n\n07:35.400 --> 07:38.240\n But then to make a cell,\n\n07:38.240 --> 07:40.800\n there probably were some RNA based cells early on,\n\n07:40.800 --> 07:42.240\n but they were pretty simple.\n\n07:42.240 --> 07:43.840\n But the cells that we know of today,\n\n07:43.840 --> 07:47.320\n even bacteria and single celled eukaryotes,\n\n07:48.360 --> 07:50.720\n they have very long DNA genomes.\n\n07:50.720 --> 07:54.360\n And you need a lot of DNA to make a complicated cell.\n\n07:54.360 --> 07:59.360\n And so we think at some point, the RNA became DNA.\n\n07:59.360 --> 08:04.080\n And probably one of the earliest enzymes that arose\n\n08:04.080 --> 08:06.480\n is the enzyme that could copy that RNA into DNA,\n\n08:06.480 --> 08:09.040\n which we now know today as reverse transcriptase,\n\n08:09.040 --> 08:11.560\n which my former boss, David Baltimore\n\n08:11.560 --> 08:14.160\n and Howard Temin co discovered.\n\n08:14.160 --> 08:19.160\n And that enzyme arose and copied RNA to DNA.\n\n08:19.400 --> 08:22.080\n And then you could build big cells with DNA\n\n08:22.080 --> 08:24.600\n because DNA can be millions and millions of bases\n\n08:24.600 --> 08:27.720\n in length and RNA, the longest RNA we know of\n\n08:27.720 --> 08:32.720\n is 40,000 bases, not much bigger than the SARS CoV2.\n\n08:32.880 --> 08:36.200\n What would you say is the magic moment along that line?\n\n08:36.200 --> 08:39.920\n I saw it was one or two billion,\n\n08:39.920 --> 08:43.840\n maybe three billion years it took\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:48.840\n to go from bacteria to complex organism.\n\n08:49.240 --> 08:52.800\n It seems like Earth had a very long time,\n\n08:52.800 --> 08:54.800\n not a very long time without life,\n\n08:54.800 --> 08:58.800\n and then a very long time with very primitive life.\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:03.200\n Maybe I'm discriminating, calling bacteria primitive life.\n\n09:03.200 --> 09:06.240\n People would object to you doing that for sure.\n\n09:06.240 --> 09:07.800\n But it seems like complex organism\n\n09:07.800 --> 09:11.040\n when it starts becoming something like,\n\n09:11.040 --> 09:13.320\n I don't know what's a good, not animal like,\n\n09:13.320 --> 09:16.880\n but more complexity than just like a single cell.\n\n09:17.800 --> 09:20.040\n What do you think is the magic there?\n\n09:20.040 --> 09:21.000\n What's the hardest thing?\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.600\n If you were trying to engineer Earth and build life\n\n09:23.600 --> 09:25.080\n and build the simulations,\n\n09:25.080 --> 09:27.880\n obviously we're living in a video game, what this is.\n\n09:27.880 --> 09:29.160\n So if you were trying to build this video game,\n\n09:29.160 --> 09:32.080\n what's the hardest part along this evolution?\n\n09:32.080 --> 09:36.080\n Bacteria are mostly single cells.\n\n09:36.080 --> 09:37.520\n They do make colonies.\n\n09:37.520 --> 09:41.160\n They get together in biofilms, which are really important.\n\n09:41.160 --> 09:43.840\n But they're all single bacteria in that.\n\n09:43.840 --> 09:46.760\n And the key is making an organism\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:49.360\n where cells do different things.\n\n09:49.360 --> 09:51.760\n We have skin cells and eye cells and brain cells.\n\n09:51.760 --> 09:53.320\n Bacteria never do that.\n\n09:53.320 --> 09:55.520\n And the reason is probably energy.\n\n09:55.520 --> 09:58.920\n Bacteria can't make enough energy to do that.\n\n09:58.920 --> 10:02.600\n And so there was another cell\n\n10:02.600 --> 10:04.320\n existing at the time, the archaea.\n\n10:06.120 --> 10:10.160\n And the idea is that a bacteria went into an archaea\n\n10:10.160 --> 10:13.120\n and became the modern day mitochondria,\n\n10:13.120 --> 10:14.960\n the energy factory of the cell.\n\n10:14.960 --> 10:17.480\n And that now led that cell\n\n10:17.480 --> 10:19.880\n develop into more and more complicated organisms\n\n10:19.880 --> 10:20.720\n like we have today.\n\n10:20.720 --> 10:21.800\n It was all about energy.\n\n10:21.800 --> 10:24.520\n So the mitochondria, the energy,\n\n10:24.520 --> 10:26.440\n the mitochondria is the magic thing.\n\n10:26.440 --> 10:27.280\n I think so.\n\n10:27.280 --> 10:28.720\n It's just actually not my idea.\n\n10:28.720 --> 10:29.560\n It's Nick Jones.\n\n10:29.560 --> 10:30.600\n Have you heard of Nick Jones?\n\n10:30.600 --> 10:33.480\n He's an evolutionary biologist in the UK.\n\n10:33.480 --> 10:36.400\n And he's done experimental work on this.\n\n10:36.400 --> 10:39.440\n And it's his idea that the defining point\n\n10:39.440 --> 10:41.840\n was the ability to make a lot of energy,\n\n10:41.840 --> 10:43.080\n which a mitochondria can do.\n\n10:43.080 --> 10:46.240\n It's basically a whole bacteria inside of a bigger cell.\n\n10:46.240 --> 10:48.240\n And that becomes what we now call eukaryotes\n\n10:48.240 --> 10:51.640\n and that they can get more and more complicated.\n\n10:51.640 --> 10:53.200\n So let me bring you back to the viruses.\n\n10:53.200 --> 10:54.320\n I wanna finish that story.\n\n10:54.320 --> 10:56.280\n Yeah, which points of viruses come along?\n\n10:56.280 --> 10:58.800\n So remember, we have these precellular,\n\n10:58.800 --> 11:01.480\n they're called precellular replicons, right?\n\n11:01.480 --> 11:05.240\n And so we have a precellular stage\n\n11:05.240 --> 11:08.720\n where we have these self replicating molecules\n\n11:08.720 --> 11:10.600\n and then cells arise.\n\n11:10.600 --> 11:15.600\n And then the self replicating molecules invade the cells.\n\n11:15.720 --> 11:16.560\n Why?\n\n11:16.560 --> 11:17.960\n Because it's a hospitable environment.\n\n11:17.960 --> 11:19.240\n I mean, they didn't know that.\n\n11:19.240 --> 11:20.560\n They just went in and it turned out\n\n11:20.560 --> 11:23.480\n it was beneficial for them, so it stuck.\n\n11:23.480 --> 11:25.600\n And they replicate inside the cell now\n\n11:25.600 --> 11:27.480\n where they have pools of everything they need.\n\n11:27.480 --> 11:29.240\n They get more and more complicated.\n\n11:29.240 --> 11:31.880\n And then they steal proteins from the cell\n\n11:31.880 --> 11:34.240\n to build a protective shell.\n\n11:34.240 --> 11:36.920\n And then they can be released as virus particles.\n\n11:36.920 --> 11:37.840\n They're now protected.\n\n11:37.840 --> 11:39.920\n They can move from host to host.\n\n11:39.920 --> 11:43.560\n And because they're at the earliest stages\n\n11:43.560 --> 11:46.680\n of cellular evolution, they can diversify\n\n11:46.680 --> 11:48.400\n to infect anything that arises.\n\n11:48.400 --> 11:52.320\n And that is why I think there's so many of them\n\n11:52.320 --> 11:54.560\n and everything on the planet is infected\n\n11:54.560 --> 11:56.080\n because the ancestor of everything\n\n11:56.080 --> 11:57.480\n was infected many years ago.\n\n11:57.480 --> 12:01.680\n So it's easier to steal than to build from scratch.\n\n12:01.680 --> 12:05.280\n So it's easier to sort of break into somebody else's thing\n\n12:05.280 --> 12:06.400\n and steal their proteins.\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:07.520\n Yes.\n\n12:07.520 --> 12:11.360\n My colleague, Dixon de Palmier, calls viruses safe crackers.\n\n12:11.360 --> 12:12.680\n Safe crackers.\n\n12:12.680 --> 12:15.800\n So it's just, from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n12:15.800 --> 12:20.720\n it's easier to steal because you can select.\n\n12:20.720 --> 12:23.320\n But then you have to figure out mechanisms for stealing,\n\n12:23.320 --> 12:25.640\n for breaking into, for cracking the state.\n\n12:25.640 --> 12:26.920\n Well, you don't have to figure out.\n\n12:26.920 --> 12:28.560\n It just happens, right?\n\n12:28.560 --> 12:30.920\n Because molecules are so diverse\n\n12:30.920 --> 12:33.360\n that a molecule gets into a cell\n\n12:33.360 --> 12:35.760\n and if there's a protein that sticks to it,\n\n12:35.760 --> 12:39.400\n it's gonna stick and that gives an advantage.\n\n12:39.400 --> 12:41.120\n There's no planning.\n\n12:41.120 --> 12:43.040\n There's no thinking about it, right?\n\n12:43.040 --> 12:44.960\n It just happens.\n\n12:44.960 --> 12:46.240\n Oh, we'll return to that.\n\n12:46.240 --> 12:48.280\n Ha ha ha ha ha.\n\n12:48.280 --> 12:50.840\n What, but these numbers are crazy.\n\n12:50.840 --> 12:55.840\n So what, as these more complex organisms evolved,\n\n12:55.880 --> 12:58.000\n let's take us humans as an example,\n\n12:58.960 --> 13:01.360\n should we be afraid of these high numbers?\n\n13:01.360 --> 13:02.320\n Should we be worried\n\n13:02.320 --> 13:05.240\n that there's so many viruses in the world?\n\n13:05.240 --> 13:06.280\n Well, to a certain extent.\n\n13:06.280 --> 13:08.200\n I mean, they have, it's twofold.\n\n13:08.200 --> 13:09.280\n They're good and bad, right?\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:12.000\n Viruses are no, there was no question they can be bad.\n\n13:12.000 --> 13:14.040\n We know that because they've infected\n\n13:14.040 --> 13:15.480\n and caused disease throughout history,\n\n13:15.480 --> 13:17.880\n but we're also, you and I are full of viruses\n\n13:17.880 --> 13:20.200\n that don't hurt us at all and probably help us\n\n13:20.200 --> 13:22.000\n and every organism is the same.\n\n13:22.000 --> 13:25.880\n So they are clearly beneficial as a consequence.\n\n13:25.880 --> 13:30.880\n So I think, so every living thing on the planet\n\n13:31.000 --> 13:35.760\n has multiple viruses infecting everything you can see.\n\n13:35.760 --> 13:39.560\n And most of them I think we don't worry about\n\n13:39.560 --> 13:41.320\n because they can't infect us.\n\n13:41.320 --> 13:42.160\n They're unable.\n\n13:42.160 --> 13:45.960\n In fact, now you can actually take your feces\n\n13:45.960 --> 13:47.000\n and send them to a company\n\n13:47.000 --> 13:49.960\n and they will sequence your viruses in your feces for you,\n\n13:49.960 --> 13:52.200\n your fecal virome, right?\n\n13:52.200 --> 13:57.200\n And the most common virus in human feces\n\n13:57.680 --> 14:00.480\n is a plant virus that infects peppers.\n\n14:00.480 --> 14:03.120\n It's called pepper model mosaic virus.\n\n14:03.120 --> 14:05.040\n And that's because people eat a lot of peppers\n\n14:05.040 --> 14:06.680\n and it just passes right through you.\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:09.160\n Cabbage is full of viruses from the insects\n\n14:09.160 --> 14:10.880\n that walk on the cabbage in the fields.\n\n14:10.880 --> 14:13.120\n We eat them, they just pass us.\n\n14:13.120 --> 14:16.360\n So I think most of the viruses we don't need to worry about\n\n14:16.360 --> 14:19.480\n except when we're talking about species\n\n14:19.480 --> 14:23.160\n that are closest to us, mammals, of course.\n\n14:23.160 --> 14:25.320\n And I think the most numerous ones\n\n14:25.320 --> 14:28.320\n are the most concerning, they're viruses like bats.\n\n14:28.320 --> 14:33.320\n Bats are 20% of mammals and rodents are 40% of mammals.\n\n14:33.480 --> 14:37.080\n And we humans live nearby, right?\n\n14:37.080 --> 14:38.600\n And we know throughout history,\n\n14:38.600 --> 14:41.440\n many viruses have come from bats and from rodents to people,\n\n14:41.440 --> 14:42.280\n no question about it.\n\n14:42.280 --> 14:44.600\n So there's a proximity in terms of just living together\n\n14:44.600 --> 14:46.240\n and a proximity genetically too.\n\n14:46.240 --> 14:48.800\n So it's more likely that a virus will jump\n\n14:48.800 --> 14:49.880\n from a bat and a rodent.\n\n14:49.880 --> 14:50.880\n And birds too.\n\n14:50.880 --> 14:53.880\n Birds can give us their viruses that's happened.\n\n14:53.880 --> 14:57.080\n Influenza viruses come from birds mainly.\n\n14:57.080 --> 15:00.640\n So I think those are the three species,\n\n15:00.640 --> 15:02.680\n not species, it's higher than species obviously,\n\n15:02.680 --> 15:04.240\n but those are the three I would worry about\n\n15:04.240 --> 15:05.960\n in terms of getting their viruses.\n\n15:05.960 --> 15:09.520\n And we don't really know what's out there, right?\n\n15:09.520 --> 15:12.480\n We have very little clue about what viruses,\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:16.480\n and I've for years wanted to capture wild mice\n\n15:16.480 --> 15:18.640\n in my backyard and see what viruses they have\n\n15:18.640 --> 15:19.640\n because no one knows.\n\n15:20.960 --> 15:21.800\n And it's an easy.\n\n15:21.800 --> 15:23.760\n We can't ask them, so you mean map,\n\n15:23.760 --> 15:24.600\n like is there a way?\n\n15:24.600 --> 15:25.440\n I can't ask them, yeah.\n\n15:25.440 --> 15:27.640\n No, I would have to sacrifice them and take tissue\n\n15:27.640 --> 15:30.120\n and then bring it in the lab and do genome sequencing.\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:32.160\n So you can do a thorough sequencing\n\n15:32.160 --> 15:33.800\n to determine which viruses.\n\n15:33.800 --> 15:37.400\n Is there a sufficiently good categorization of viruses\n\n15:37.400 --> 15:38.240\n where you'd be?\n\n15:38.240 --> 15:40.080\n That's a very good question.\n\n15:40.080 --> 15:42.640\n So whenever you do sequence, right?\n\n15:42.640 --> 15:44.160\n You get some environmental sample\n\n15:44.160 --> 15:47.120\n and you extract nucleic acid and you sequence it.\n\n15:47.120 --> 15:49.680\n What you do is you run it past the database.\n\n15:49.680 --> 15:52.120\n The gold standard is the GenBank database\n\n15:52.120 --> 15:54.360\n which is maintained here in the US.\n\n15:54.360 --> 15:56.600\n And you see if you get any hits.\n\n15:56.600 --> 15:58.560\n And then you can say, ah, look,\n\n15:58.560 --> 16:01.080\n this sequence is similar to this virus.\n\n16:01.080 --> 16:03.560\n And you can classify all the viruses you see.\n\n16:03.560 --> 16:08.560\n The problem is 90% of your sequence is dark matter.\n\n16:09.200 --> 16:11.120\n It doesn't hit with anything.\n\n16:11.120 --> 16:14.480\n It's probably a lot of it is unknown viruses.\n\n16:14.480 --> 16:16.080\n And that's gonna be hard to figure out\n\n16:16.080 --> 16:17.640\n because someone's gonna have to go after it\n\n16:17.640 --> 16:18.960\n and sort it through.\n\n16:18.960 --> 16:21.600\n So yes, you can find a lot of viruses\n\n16:21.600 --> 16:22.960\n and the numbers you get are astounding.\n\n16:22.960 --> 16:25.200\n You can find thousands of new viruses\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:28.160\n just by looking in various life forms.\n\n16:28.160 --> 16:30.400\n But there are many more that we don't pick up\n\n16:30.400 --> 16:32.200\n because they're not in the database.\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:36.120\n Maybe this is a good time to take a quick tangent.\n\n16:36.120 --> 16:38.000\n What do you think about Alpha Fold 2?\n\n16:38.000 --> 16:40.280\n I don't know if you've been paying attention to that.\n\n16:40.280 --> 16:44.200\n With them DeepMind solving the protein folding problem\n\n16:44.200 --> 16:47.800\n and then also releasing, first of all,\n\n16:47.800 --> 16:49.960\n open sourcing the code, which is for me\n\n16:49.960 --> 16:52.240\n as a software person, I love.\n\n16:52.240 --> 16:57.000\n And then second of all, also making like 300,000 predictions\n\n16:57.000 --> 17:00.040\n or something like that for different protein structures\n\n17:00.040 --> 17:01.760\n and releasing that data.\n\n17:01.760 --> 17:02.600\n Yeah.\n\n17:03.520 --> 17:04.360\n On the side of,\n\n17:04.360 --> 17:06.840\n because you're saying there's dark matter.\n\n17:06.840 --> 17:07.680\n Right.\n\n17:07.680 --> 17:12.680\n Is there something, first, what are your general thoughts,\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:15.920\n level of excitement about their work?\n\n17:15.920 --> 17:19.400\n And second, how can that be applied to viruses?\n\n17:19.400 --> 17:20.800\n Do you think we'll be able to explore\n\n17:20.800 --> 17:24.520\n the dark matter of virology using machine learning?\n\n17:24.520 --> 17:25.360\n Absolutely.\n\n17:25.360 --> 17:26.800\n Because in all this dark sequence,\n\n17:26.800 --> 17:29.880\n you can translate it and make a protein.\n\n17:29.880 --> 17:31.480\n You can see what a protein looks like.\n\n17:31.480 --> 17:34.000\n It has what we call an open reading frame, right?\n\n17:34.000 --> 17:35.280\n A start and a stop.\n\n17:35.280 --> 17:37.520\n And right now it's just a bunch of amino acids,\n\n17:37.520 --> 17:39.800\n but if we could fold it,\n\n17:39.800 --> 17:43.200\n maybe the fold would be like something we already know,\n\n17:43.200 --> 17:46.480\n some protein fold, which gives you a lot of clues, right?\n\n17:46.480 --> 17:49.640\n Because there are only so many protein folds in biology\n\n17:49.640 --> 17:52.600\n and that dark matter is probably one of them.\n\n17:52.600 --> 17:55.200\n So I think that's very exciting because for years,\n\n17:55.200 --> 17:59.560\n I've followed structural biologists for years\n\n17:59.560 --> 18:01.960\n and in the beginning,\n\n18:01.960 --> 18:04.480\n we couldn't even solve structures of viruses, they're too big.\n\n18:04.480 --> 18:06.760\n We could do small molecules like myoglobin,\n\n18:06.760 --> 18:09.400\n that was the first one done, took years to do that.\n\n18:09.400 --> 18:13.040\n Then as computational power increased,\n\n18:13.040 --> 18:14.720\n then they could start to do viruses,\n\n18:14.720 --> 18:16.760\n but it took a long time.\n\n18:16.760 --> 18:18.400\n X ray crystallography,\n\n18:18.400 --> 18:21.520\n depending on getting crystals of the virus, right?\n\n18:21.520 --> 18:24.440\n And now we can do cryo electron microscopy,\n\n18:24.440 --> 18:26.360\n which is much faster.\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:27.240\n You could solve,\n\n18:27.240 --> 18:29.680\n the spike of SARS COVID 2 was solved in two months\n\n18:29.680 --> 18:32.520\n by Jason McClelland here in Austin actually\n\n18:32.520 --> 18:34.840\n at the beginning of the pandemic,\n\n18:34.840 --> 18:38.720\n but you're limited, you can't do huge proteins.\n\n18:38.720 --> 18:41.960\n You can only do moderately sized ones.\n\n18:41.960 --> 18:45.440\n So, or actually you can do viruses,\n\n18:45.440 --> 18:47.000\n but you can't do small proteins.\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:50.720\n So that's speeded it up, but it's still too fast to solve.\n\n18:50.720 --> 18:52.720\n You get a new protein, you wanna solve its structure.\n\n18:52.720 --> 18:53.840\n So if we could predict it,\n\n18:53.840 --> 18:55.960\n and I know from talking to structural biologists,\n\n18:55.960 --> 18:58.280\n this has been their holy grail from day one.\n\n18:58.280 --> 19:00.880\n They wanna be able to take a sequence of a protein,\n\n19:00.880 --> 19:03.320\n put it in a computer and have the structure put out\n\n19:03.320 --> 19:05.200\n without having to do all the experiment.\n\n19:05.200 --> 19:06.840\n So that's why this is very exciting\n\n19:06.840 --> 19:08.560\n that you can predict it.\n\n19:08.560 --> 19:10.800\n That mean it's not finished obviously,\n\n19:10.800 --> 19:11.840\n and there's more to do,\n\n19:11.840 --> 19:12.960\n but I think it will be a day\n\n19:12.960 --> 19:15.540\n where you could take any amino acid sequence\n\n19:15.540 --> 19:17.360\n and predict what it's gonna look like.\n\n19:17.360 --> 19:19.520\n See, but like aren't structural biologists\n\n19:19.520 --> 19:20.400\n gonna get greedy?\n\n19:20.400 --> 19:21.720\n So once you have that,\n\n19:21.720 --> 19:24.040\n don't you wanna go more complicated then?\n\n19:24.040 --> 19:25.440\n Don't you wanna go,\n\n19:25.440 --> 19:27.680\n because that's just the first step, right?\n\n19:27.680 --> 19:29.480\n You go from amino acid to the structure,\n\n19:29.480 --> 19:32.120\n then there's like multiple protein interactions.\n\n19:32.120 --> 19:34.400\n Like how do you get to the virus?\n\n19:34.400 --> 19:37.020\n Well, so that's what the ultimate goal\n\n19:37.020 --> 19:39.700\n of getting a structure is that then you can do experiments\n\n19:39.700 --> 19:42.400\n and figure out what the structure means, right?\n\n19:42.400 --> 19:44.880\n So many, in the old days,\n\n19:44.880 --> 19:48.160\n structural biology was a career in itself.\n\n19:48.160 --> 19:50.000\n You worked with people who had a system\n\n19:50.000 --> 19:51.360\n and just solve proteins for them,\n\n19:51.360 --> 19:52.520\n and then you moved on to another one.\n\n19:52.520 --> 19:54.200\n You didn't really do any experiments.\n\n19:54.200 --> 19:57.000\n The other people got to do all the interesting experiments.\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:02.000\n Now, young structural biologists are multifaceted.\n\n20:02.300 --> 20:03.640\n They solve the structure,\n\n20:03.640 --> 20:04.480\n and then they say,\n\n20:04.480 --> 20:06.520\n what happens if we change this amino acid?\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:09.000\n Oh, look, it blocks binding to the receptor.\n\n20:09.000 --> 20:11.240\n This must be the receptor binding interface.\n\n20:11.240 --> 20:13.400\n So that's the exciting stuff, absolutely,\n\n20:13.400 --> 20:14.480\n is doing the experiment.\n\n20:14.480 --> 20:18.780\n Well, I wonder if you can do some kinds of like simulations\n\n20:18.780 --> 20:22.240\n of like, you know, different proteins\n\n20:22.240 --> 20:26.320\n or multi protein systems going to war against each other,\n\n20:27.640 --> 20:30.440\n like to try to figure out, you know,\n\n20:31.400 --> 20:35.360\n reinforcement learning is used in alpha zero, for example,\n\n20:35.360 --> 20:37.120\n to learn chess and go,\n\n20:37.120 --> 20:39.200\n and that's using the self play mechanism\n\n20:39.200 --> 20:41.360\n where the thing plays against itself\n\n20:41.360 --> 20:42.760\n and learns better and better.\n\n20:42.760 --> 20:45.080\n Whether you can, I wonder if you can simulate\n\n20:45.080 --> 20:46.680\n almost evolution in that way\n\n20:46.680 --> 20:49.560\n for primitive biological systems,\n\n20:49.560 --> 20:52.600\n have them in simulation, fight each other,\n\n20:52.600 --> 20:53.640\n and then see what comes out,\n\n20:53.640 --> 20:55.680\n like a super dangerous virus comes out\n\n20:55.680 --> 20:58.480\n or super like Chuck Norris type of thing\n\n20:58.480 --> 21:00.640\n that defends against the super dangerous virus,\n\n21:00.640 --> 21:01.840\n and it's all in simulation.\n\n21:01.840 --> 21:03.680\n So an example would be,\n\n21:03.680 --> 21:07.840\n we have all these variants of SARS COVID 2 arising, right?\n\n21:07.840 --> 21:12.840\n Which look to be selected by immune responses,\n\n21:13.080 --> 21:17.280\n but we know what amino acids are changing in the spike\n\n21:17.280 --> 21:19.080\n and how they block antibody binding.\n\n21:19.080 --> 21:20.360\n You could simulate that.\n\n21:20.360 --> 21:24.960\n You could say, what is the antibody looking at?\n\n21:24.960 --> 21:28.040\n Where antibodies bind on proteins are called epitopes, right?\n\n21:28.040 --> 21:30.400\n You could map them all and change them in a simulation\n\n21:30.400 --> 21:32.120\n one by one and go back and forth\n\n21:32.120 --> 21:33.800\n between the antibody and the virus.\n\n21:33.800 --> 21:38.400\n So all these, evolution is what we call an arms race, right?\n\n21:38.400 --> 21:41.600\n The virus changes and then it evades the host\n\n21:41.600 --> 21:43.240\n and then the host can change.\n\n21:43.240 --> 21:45.240\n The host takes longer to change though, unfortunately.\n\n21:45.240 --> 21:47.960\n It takes geological time, but it can.\n\n21:47.960 --> 21:49.640\n And then the virus can change\n\n21:49.640 --> 21:50.600\n and it can go back and forth.\n\n21:50.600 --> 21:54.360\n And we can see evidence of this in genome sequences\n\n21:54.360 --> 21:56.240\n of both viruses and their hosts.\n\n21:56.240 --> 22:00.040\n And so you can take a protein in a host\n\n22:00.040 --> 22:02.720\n that is a receptor for multiple viruses\n\n22:02.720 --> 22:05.720\n and you can see all the impacts of virus pressure on it.\n\n22:05.720 --> 22:07.280\n And you could simulate that for sure.\n\n22:07.280 --> 22:09.000\n And that's just one thing that you could do.\n\n22:09.000 --> 22:13.680\n You could simulate changes in say an enzyme\n\n22:13.680 --> 22:15.120\n that makes it resistant to a drug\n\n22:15.120 --> 22:18.240\n and predict all the drug resistance.\n\n22:18.240 --> 22:21.280\n But the problem is people like me,\n\n22:21.280 --> 22:22.800\n the experimental virologists\n\n22:22.800 --> 22:24.040\n don't know how to do any of that.\n\n22:24.040 --> 22:27.720\n So we need to collaborate with people, I guess.\n\n22:27.720 --> 22:29.680\n Oh, with other humans.\n\n22:29.680 --> 22:31.480\n We do that, we do that.\n\n22:31.480 --> 22:35.720\n But with people from a field that we're not used to,\n\n22:35.720 --> 22:39.160\n I suppose people who, would it be AI, I suppose?\n\n22:39.160 --> 22:40.000\n Yeah, machine learning people.\n\n22:40.000 --> 22:41.320\n Machine learning people.\n\n22:41.320 --> 22:44.400\n And you would say, look, this is the biological problem.\n\n22:44.400 --> 22:46.960\n Is there a way we can use your tools to attack it?\n\n22:46.960 --> 22:51.680\n The problem is those people are antisocial introverts\n\n22:51.680 --> 22:55.160\n that have a place like this\n\n22:55.160 --> 22:57.200\n and try to hide from other people in the world.\n\n22:57.200 --> 22:59.160\n Very difficult to find in the wild.\n\n23:00.120 --> 23:04.960\n Okay, so outside of doing amazing brilliant lectures online,\n\n23:04.960 --> 23:09.960\n you host and produce five, I would say, related podcasts,\n\n23:09.960 --> 23:13.600\n including my favorite, This Week in Virology,\n\n23:13.600 --> 23:16.280\n also This Week in Parasitism,\n\n23:16.280 --> 23:18.640\n This Week in Microbiology, and so on.\n\n23:18.640 --> 23:21.080\n So you're a good person to ask,\n\n23:21.080 --> 23:23.960\n what are the categories of small things,\n\n23:23.960 --> 23:27.320\n small biological things in this world that can kill you,\n\n23:27.320 --> 23:28.880\n kill us humans?\n\n23:30.120 --> 23:33.360\n Let's look, you said like most viruses are friendly\n\n23:33.360 --> 23:35.840\n or at least not unfriendly.\n\n23:35.840 --> 23:38.960\n But let's look at the unfriendly ones.\n\n23:38.960 --> 23:42.160\n And viruses and bacteria and those kinds of things.\n\n23:42.160 --> 23:43.960\n When you look at the full spectrum of things\n\n23:43.960 --> 23:47.240\n that can kill you, can you kind of paint a brief picture?\n\n23:47.240 --> 23:50.720\n Yeah, I think the big picture is that\n\n23:50.720 --> 23:52.720\n the things that can kill you are a minority\n\n23:52.720 --> 23:54.320\n of everything that's out there.\n\n23:54.320 --> 23:57.240\n And we're talking about molecules.\n\n23:57.240 --> 24:01.320\n So we have in us proteins that can kill us.\n\n24:01.320 --> 24:04.560\n Preons that are just, it's a protein in us.\n\n24:04.560 --> 24:08.680\n And if it misfolds, it makes all of its other copies misfold\n\n24:08.680 --> 24:11.680\n and then you die of a neurological disease.\n\n24:11.680 --> 24:12.680\n That's pretty rare.\n\n24:13.840 --> 24:16.480\n So there are proteins, there are viruses.\n\n24:16.480 --> 24:20.200\n And as I said, only certain ones can kill us.\n\n24:20.200 --> 24:22.960\n But even if we get those from animals,\n\n24:22.960 --> 24:24.440\n it's not straightforward.\n\n24:24.440 --> 24:26.760\n If you look at SARS CoV2, right?\n\n24:26.760 --> 24:29.880\n This is probably a once in a hundred year pandemic,\n\n24:29.880 --> 24:34.760\n I would say, equivalent to 1918 in its devastation.\n\n24:34.760 --> 24:36.560\n And in between there have been smaller pandemics\n\n24:36.560 --> 24:39.600\n of other viruses, but it doesn't happen all that often.\n\n24:39.600 --> 24:40.560\n So we have a lot of viruses.\n\n24:40.560 --> 24:43.600\n We have a lot of bacteria of various sorts\n\n24:43.600 --> 24:46.240\n that can cause infections in us.\n\n24:46.240 --> 24:49.240\n And it's a limited number, right?\n\n24:49.240 --> 24:52.680\n You're streptococci and staphylococci and clostridia.\n\n24:52.680 --> 24:56.360\n We could go on and on, but we know how to handle those.\n\n24:56.360 --> 24:58.280\n As long as we have antimicrobials,\n\n24:58.280 --> 25:00.360\n it's just that we abuse them and we get resistant.\n\n25:00.360 --> 25:02.120\n So that can be a problem.\n\n25:02.120 --> 25:04.840\n Then we have fungi, not mushrooms,\n\n25:04.840 --> 25:09.440\n but much smaller fungi that multiply sub microscopic\n\n25:09.440 --> 25:11.400\n or just at the microscopic level.\n\n25:11.400 --> 25:13.920\n They can, in dry climates of the US,\n\n25:13.920 --> 25:16.280\n you can inhale their spores and they can grow in your lung\n\n25:16.280 --> 25:18.800\n if you're immunosuppressed and so forth.\n\n25:18.800 --> 25:21.080\n So those are the tiny guys.\n\n25:21.080 --> 25:22.320\n And then we have parasites,\n\n25:22.320 --> 25:24.960\n which we do this week in parasitism,\n\n25:24.960 --> 25:29.960\n where single cells, even worms of various sorts\n\n25:30.040 --> 25:33.640\n can invade you and cause all sorts of problems.\n\n25:33.640 --> 25:37.200\n How, I was like kind of terrified to listen to that podcast.\n\n25:37.200 --> 25:39.720\n What's it like?\n\n25:39.720 --> 25:44.720\n Well, I mean, what you learn is that you can,\n\n25:45.200 --> 25:47.200\n you travel somewhere and you can get infected\n\n25:47.200 --> 25:48.720\n and bring it back home.\n\n25:48.720 --> 25:52.640\n Here in the US, we do have certain kinds of parasites,\n\n25:52.640 --> 25:55.000\n but because of our lifestyle,\n\n25:55.000 --> 25:56.560\n we more or less have avoided them.\n\n25:56.560 --> 26:00.440\n For example, there's a parasite called toxoplasma,\n\n26:00.440 --> 26:03.960\n which is infected most of the world, actually,\n\n26:03.960 --> 26:06.160\n because a lot of people like to eat raw meat\n\n26:06.160 --> 26:08.400\n and you would get it from raw meat.\n\n26:08.400 --> 26:12.320\n And we're not as fond of that here in the US.\n\n26:12.320 --> 26:13.320\n We like to cook our meat,\n\n26:13.320 --> 26:16.440\n but that could be a consequence of eating raw meat.\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:19.840\n Is that what leads to, what is it called, toxoplasmosis?\n\n26:19.840 --> 26:24.360\n Yeah, so toxoplasmosis, it's mainly,\n\n26:25.560 --> 26:28.400\n a big issue is if you're pregnant and you get toxo,\n\n26:28.400 --> 26:32.520\n then your fetus is gonna be very badly malformed.\n\n26:32.520 --> 26:35.000\n It's gonna have brain defects and so forth.\n\n26:36.240 --> 26:39.480\n And animals can get it as well.\n\n26:39.480 --> 26:41.280\n So there are a lot of parasites of that nature,\n\n26:41.280 --> 26:43.280\n which you often acquire by food,\n\n26:43.280 --> 26:45.000\n eating food of different sorts.\n\n26:45.000 --> 26:47.560\n And it usually happens elsewhere.\n\n26:47.560 --> 26:50.840\n On This Week in Parasitism, we do a case.\n\n26:50.840 --> 26:54.320\n So Daniel Griffin is our resident physician.\n\n26:54.320 --> 26:56.480\n He's a doctor, a real doctor, right?\n\n26:56.480 --> 26:58.640\n And every month, he comes up with a case.\n\n26:58.640 --> 27:00.880\n Okay, this is a person I saw.\n\n27:00.880 --> 27:04.960\n And last month, this young lady had traveled somewhere\n\n27:04.960 --> 27:09.600\n and she ate raw fish.\n\n27:09.600 --> 27:11.920\n It was somewhere Southeast Asia or something.\n\n27:11.920 --> 27:15.880\n And she ended up with red bumps all over her skin.\n\n27:15.880 --> 27:17.720\n And it turned out it was a parasite from the fish\n\n27:17.720 --> 27:21.720\n that moved around in her and very easy to cure.\n\n27:21.720 --> 27:23.720\n We have, if the right doctors and the right drugs,\n\n27:23.720 --> 27:24.640\n you can cure all these things.\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:27.600\n What about diagnose, like connect the red spots\n\n27:27.600 --> 27:28.760\n to the fact that it's a parasite?\n\n27:28.760 --> 27:31.240\n It's very easy if you have the right diagnostics.\n\n27:31.240 --> 27:33.080\n Now, Daniel often goes to parts of the world\n\n27:33.080 --> 27:34.560\n where they don't have diagnostics\n\n27:34.560 --> 27:37.240\n and he has to use other mechanisms.\n\n27:37.240 --> 27:40.320\n He may have to take a bit and look at it under a microscope.\n\n27:40.320 --> 27:41.960\n And then he may not be able to get the drug\n\n27:41.960 --> 27:43.840\n depending on where he is.\n\n27:43.840 --> 27:47.160\n But often he sees patients who come back to the US\n\n27:47.160 --> 27:49.640\n and they get diarrhea or they have a fever.\n\n27:49.640 --> 27:50.720\n And he said, where have you been?\n\n27:50.720 --> 27:52.200\n And he can put two and two together.\n\n27:52.200 --> 27:53.800\n And so we let our listeners do that.\n\n27:53.800 --> 27:55.240\n And they all send in guesses.\n\n27:55.240 --> 27:57.840\n And it's wonderful to hear them go through this.\n\n27:57.840 --> 28:00.760\n So there are a lot of parasites that can get you.\n\n28:00.760 --> 28:03.360\n You have to be careful about eating when you go overseas.\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:04.640\n And water too?\n\n28:04.640 --> 28:05.520\n Water as well.\n\n28:05.520 --> 28:09.200\n And in parts of Africa, there are parasites in the lakes\n\n28:09.200 --> 28:11.840\n that if you go swimming, they can invade you.\n\n28:11.840 --> 28:14.080\n And in fact, they can go into your hair follicles\n\n28:14.080 --> 28:15.960\n and burrow in and get into your bloodstream.\n\n28:15.960 --> 28:16.960\n That's exciting.\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:20.320\n So Daniel is interesting because he's very adventurous\n\n28:20.320 --> 28:22.800\n and he's not afraid of any of this.\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:26.040\n So there's a famous lake in Africa, Lake Malawi,\n\n28:26.040 --> 28:28.480\n which harbors a lot of these parasites.\n\n28:28.480 --> 28:30.280\n And he said, oh yeah, yeah, I just make sure\n\n28:30.280 --> 28:34.840\n I towel off vigorously when I get out and get rid of them.\n\n28:34.840 --> 28:37.160\n And that was the name of an episode.\n\n28:37.160 --> 28:42.160\n But food is, sushi, you can get worms from sushi.\n\n28:43.400 --> 28:46.800\n And the solution is to freeze it.\n\n28:46.800 --> 28:49.880\n And many sushi restaurants now have liquid nitrogen.\n\n28:49.880 --> 28:53.000\n They snap freeze their sushi and that kills all the parasites.\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:56.400\n And a study was actually done in Japan\n\n28:56.400 --> 28:59.240\n showing that freezing does not alter the taste of sushi\n\n28:59.240 --> 29:01.680\n because it's up, you see a big industry there.\n\n29:01.680 --> 29:03.240\n Wow, that's brilliant.\n\n29:03.240 --> 29:04.440\n That's brilliant.\n\n29:04.440 --> 29:09.440\n Yeah, I was thinking about, I'm so boring and bland\n\n29:10.560 --> 29:12.640\n that especially when I am now in Texas here\n\n29:12.640 --> 29:14.280\n and I've been eating quite a bit of barbecue,\n\n29:14.280 --> 29:18.960\n I realized I really haven't explored the culinary world.\n\n29:18.960 --> 29:22.280\n And I've been curious to travel and taste different foods.\n\n29:22.280 --> 29:25.060\n Is there something you could say by way of advice,\n\n29:26.680 --> 29:30.160\n channeling Daniel, I guess, if you were to travel\n\n29:30.160 --> 29:32.600\n in the world, if eating is the thing\n\n29:32.600 --> 29:34.560\n that gets you the parasites,\n\n29:34.560 --> 29:37.040\n what's a good advice for eating\n\n29:37.040 --> 29:41.760\n in strange parts of the world, Mongolia, India, China?\n\n29:41.760 --> 29:43.840\n Is there something you could say by way of advice?\n\n29:43.840 --> 29:45.200\n I think Daniel would say,\n\n29:45.200 --> 29:47.520\n make sure your food is cooked, right?\n\n29:47.520 --> 29:49.040\n Cooked, but that's so boring.\n\n29:49.040 --> 29:50.440\n Yeah, it's unfortunate.\n\n29:50.440 --> 29:52.200\n And he would agree with you\n\n29:52.200 --> 29:55.520\n because many vegetables are delicious.\n\n29:55.520 --> 29:57.840\n Salads even are delicious, not cooked,\n\n29:57.840 --> 29:59.520\n but they can have parasites in them.\n\n29:59.520 --> 30:04.280\n Meats, fish, people like to have uncooked fish.\n\n30:04.280 --> 30:06.060\n So if you wanna be really safe and boring,\n\n30:06.060 --> 30:07.920\n just make sure everything is cooked.\n\n30:07.920 --> 30:11.000\n And now we have a case this week on TWIP\n\n30:11.000 --> 30:14.200\n of a young man who went, I forgot where he went,\n\n30:14.200 --> 30:15.600\n but he stayed in a hotel.\n\n30:15.600 --> 30:18.080\n I think, oh, Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\n30:18.080 --> 30:19.320\n Stayed in a hotel.\n\n30:20.480 --> 30:23.740\n And he came back with diarrhea and fever.\n\n30:23.740 --> 30:26.520\n And he said, I don't know where, I stayed in the hotel.\n\n30:26.520 --> 30:30.000\n I just ate hotel food, lots of vegetables and fruits,\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:32.960\n and probably they weren't washed with clean water.\n\n30:32.960 --> 30:34.840\n He got something from that.\n\n30:34.840 --> 30:38.480\n The bottom line is most of these infections\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:40.180\n with parasites can be diagnosed,\n\n30:40.180 --> 30:42.680\n and you can be treated, and you'll be fine.\n\n30:42.680 --> 30:47.520\n So if you really wanna experience the cuisine,\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:49.240\n I don't think you should worry about it.\n\n30:49.240 --> 30:50.680\n That's what Daniel would say.\n\n30:50.680 --> 30:51.960\n Let's return to the basics.\n\n30:51.960 --> 30:54.840\n We can then jump around all over the place.\n\n30:54.840 --> 30:58.720\n What are the basic principles of virology?\n\n30:58.720 --> 31:02.120\n Maybe a good place to start is what is a virus?\n\n31:02.120 --> 31:03.600\n That's great.\n\n31:03.600 --> 31:05.840\n I mean, I talk in my first lecture for 20 minutes\n\n31:05.840 --> 31:07.520\n before I get to that.\n\n31:07.520 --> 31:10.060\n But, and I wonder if I should put it up front,\n\n31:10.060 --> 31:12.100\n but it's kind of a boring definition.\n\n31:12.100 --> 31:14.840\n So if you do that first, people will turn off.\n\n31:14.840 --> 31:17.600\n So first you tell them about all the millions and billions\n\n31:17.600 --> 31:18.920\n of viruses around.\n\n31:18.920 --> 31:22.720\n So a virus, we have a very specific definition\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:26.400\n because it's different from everything else on the planet.\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:28.960\n Because first of all, it's a parasite.\n\n31:28.960 --> 31:32.060\n It takes, a parasite means you take something\n\n31:32.060 --> 31:33.920\n from someone else.\n\n31:33.920 --> 31:36.840\n We have human parasites who take money from others, right?\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:40.880\n But in biological terms, a parasite takes something\n\n31:40.880 --> 31:44.280\n from the host that the host would otherwise use energy\n\n31:44.280 --> 31:46.200\n or some building block or something.\n\n31:46.200 --> 31:48.560\n There's never really a symbiotic relationship\n\n31:48.560 --> 31:50.440\n between a virus and a host.\n\n31:50.440 --> 31:52.000\n Well, there can be.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.640\n So that's the dichotomy I think is that we define them\n\n31:54.640 --> 31:58.720\n as parasites, yet I just told you 20 minutes ago\n\n31:58.720 --> 32:01.520\n that many viruses are probably beneficial.\n\n32:01.520 --> 32:04.480\n So I think what it means is we, at some point\n\n32:04.480 --> 32:06.800\n we're gonna have to change our definition, right?\n\n32:06.800 --> 32:11.800\n Because after all, definitions we make are just constructs\n\n32:12.000 --> 32:14.140\n that make it easy for us to study,\n\n32:14.140 --> 32:16.760\n that don't necessarily represent what's right.\n\n32:16.760 --> 32:20.420\n Yeah, like Pluto was a planet at first\n\n32:20.420 --> 32:21.680\n and now it's not a planet anymore\n\n32:21.680 --> 32:23.360\n and a lot of people are very upset.\n\n32:23.360 --> 32:24.700\n But it's only according to us.\n\n32:24.700 --> 32:27.020\n There may be another race living somewhere else\n\n32:27.020 --> 32:28.500\n who thinks it's a planet, right?\n\n32:28.500 --> 32:30.680\n Well, maybe that's why viruses are attacking humans.\n\n32:30.680 --> 32:31.560\n They're very angry.\n\n32:31.560 --> 32:33.980\n They're calling them parasites.\n\n32:33.980 --> 32:38.000\n So right now our definition includes parasite\n\n32:38.000 --> 32:41.400\n because a virus cannot do anything without a cell.\n\n32:41.400 --> 32:44.040\n If this mug were full of viruses,\n\n32:44.040 --> 32:46.360\n it would not do anything for years.\n\n32:46.360 --> 32:49.040\n It would eventually probably lose its infectivity,\n\n32:49.040 --> 32:52.040\n but it's not gonna reproduce here, it needs cells.\n\n32:52.040 --> 32:54.240\n And to the first people who discovered viruses,\n\n32:54.240 --> 32:57.360\n that was astounding that they didn't just reproduce,\n\n32:57.360 --> 32:59.640\n divide on their own like bacteria.\n\n32:59.640 --> 33:02.640\n So a virus needs to get inside of a cell,\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:05.520\n inside the cell, it can't just hang around on the surface.\n\n33:05.520 --> 33:09.200\n It needs to get in in order to make more of itself.\n\n33:09.200 --> 33:13.080\n And so we call it an obligate intracellular parasite\n\n33:13.080 --> 33:15.060\n because it needs to get in a cell\n\n33:15.060 --> 33:17.320\n and then it takes things from the cell\n\n33:17.320 --> 33:19.280\n in the form of all kinds of molecules\n\n33:19.280 --> 33:22.660\n and processes and energy and so forth to make new viruses.\n\n33:23.640 --> 33:26.240\n Obligate means it's obligated to be inside the cell.\n\n33:26.240 --> 33:30.800\n Absolutely, it will not reproduce outside of the cell.\n\n33:30.800 --> 33:35.800\n So this mug of viruses can in no way be living,\n\n33:35.880 --> 33:36.920\n in my opinion.\n\n33:36.920 --> 33:39.160\n However, once it gets inside of a cell,\n\n33:39.160 --> 33:42.320\n now the cell is a virus infected cell, it's alive.\n\n33:42.320 --> 33:45.360\n So a virus, in my view, has two phases, right?\n\n33:45.360 --> 33:48.200\n It's this nonliving particulate phase\n\n33:48.200 --> 33:49.580\n that everyone is used to.\n\n33:50.600 --> 33:52.720\n I'll send you, you need a virus for your table.\n\n33:52.720 --> 33:54.560\n I'll send you a nice model.\n\n33:54.560 --> 33:55.400\n I think it would look good here.\n\n33:55.400 --> 33:56.240\n Which, yes, definitely.\n\n33:56.240 --> 33:57.800\n You don't have to go with all this other stuff.\n\n33:57.800 --> 33:59.560\n Yeah, well, these are all mechanical.\n\n33:59.560 --> 34:01.240\n There's no biology here.\n\n34:01.240 --> 34:02.480\n So you wouldn't want a virus here?\n\n34:02.480 --> 34:04.000\n No, I'd want a virus, of course.\n\n34:04.000 --> 34:06.840\n No, I'll send you one and then you can look at it.\n\n34:06.840 --> 34:09.920\n Because now that we have the three dimensional structures\n\n34:09.920 --> 34:12.600\n solved by structural biologists,\n\n34:12.600 --> 34:14.720\n we take the coordinates and we put it in a 3D printer\n\n34:14.720 --> 34:16.880\n and you can make amazing models, right?\n\n34:18.040 --> 34:18.880\n Of any virus.\n\n34:18.880 --> 34:21.520\n And so there's a huge variety of viruses?\n\n34:21.520 --> 34:23.320\n Huge, that we know of,\n\n34:23.320 --> 34:24.840\n which is only a fraction of what's out there.\n\n34:24.840 --> 34:25.800\n What's the categories?\n\n34:25.800 --> 34:27.840\n So there's RNA, there's DNA viruses.\n\n34:27.840 --> 34:30.240\n What are those, what's DNA and RNA?\n\n34:30.240 --> 34:33.920\n Two broad categorizations.\n\n34:33.920 --> 34:37.080\n RNA, these are genetic material.\n\n34:37.080 --> 34:39.200\n Can be two different chemicals.\n\n34:39.200 --> 34:43.120\n So RNA, everything else on the planet besides viruses\n\n34:43.120 --> 34:44.120\n is all DNA based.\n\n34:44.120 --> 34:45.280\n You and I are DNA based.\n\n34:45.280 --> 34:47.320\n Everything on the planet today is DNA based,\n\n34:47.320 --> 34:50.200\n except some viruses are RNA based.\n\n34:50.200 --> 34:53.120\n And that's because, as I mentioned earlier,\n\n34:53.120 --> 34:57.240\n the first life that arose on the planet was RNA based.\n\n34:57.240 --> 34:59.480\n Yeah, so these are like old school viruses.\n\n34:59.480 --> 35:00.600\n These are old school.\n\n35:00.600 --> 35:02.560\n We call relics, yeah.\n\n35:02.560 --> 35:04.480\n Relics, and this has got a name,\n\n35:04.480 --> 35:06.760\n it's called the RNA world, which I think is great.\n\n35:06.760 --> 35:09.640\n Is it big still, or are the relics dying out?\n\n35:09.640 --> 35:11.520\n Oh no, the relics, in my opinion,\n\n35:11.520 --> 35:14.880\n are the most successful viruses, the RNA viruses.\n\n35:14.880 --> 35:16.680\n And SARS CoV2 is an RNA virus.\n\n35:16.680 --> 35:19.040\n We can talk about why they're so successful.\n\n35:19.040 --> 35:22.720\n But you have, broadly speaking, viruses with RNA,\n\n35:22.720 --> 35:24.920\n genetic information, which are relics.\n\n35:24.920 --> 35:26.440\n Of course, they're contemporary.\n\n35:26.440 --> 35:28.920\n They have adapted to the modern world\n\n35:28.920 --> 35:31.160\n and the modern organisms living in it.\n\n35:31.160 --> 35:33.240\n And then we have DNA based viruses,\n\n35:33.240 --> 35:36.440\n which are extremely conservative and slow.\n\n35:36.440 --> 35:37.800\n They're very successful.\n\n35:37.800 --> 35:40.040\n Everyone has a herpes virus infection,\n\n35:40.040 --> 35:44.520\n but they don't get the news like the RNA viruses do.\n\n35:44.520 --> 35:46.800\n The HIVs and the influenza viruses\n\n35:46.800 --> 35:49.880\n and the SARS Coronaviruses, they get all the press\n\n35:49.880 --> 35:52.880\n and they're RNA based, because RNA lets you change\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:54.400\n more so than DNA.\n\n35:54.400 --> 35:57.240\n So they evolve much faster, the RNA viruses.\n\n35:57.240 --> 35:58.320\n Much faster.\n\n35:58.320 --> 36:01.920\n And in fact, I have an lecture on evolution.\n\n36:01.920 --> 36:03.800\n I don't know if you've listened to that one.\n\n36:03.800 --> 36:06.600\n You should, it's really, I think it's really interesting.\n\n36:07.760 --> 36:12.760\n RNA viruses exist at their error threshold,\n\n36:13.720 --> 36:17.120\n which means they can't make any more mutations\n\n36:17.120 --> 36:19.560\n when they reproduce, otherwise they're dead.\n\n36:19.560 --> 36:20.880\n They would go extinct.\n\n36:20.880 --> 36:23.600\n They're evolving at their error threshold.\n\n36:23.600 --> 36:26.280\n DNA viruses are hundreds of times lower\n\n36:26.280 --> 36:28.400\n than their error thresholds.\n\n36:28.400 --> 36:31.120\n And we know this, we can do an experiment to find that out.\n\n36:31.120 --> 36:33.560\n Now, why that is, is a good question,\n\n36:33.560 --> 36:38.240\n but that's the reason why RNA viruses\n\n36:38.240 --> 36:39.400\n are far more successful.\n\n36:39.400 --> 36:42.920\n They infect many more hosts and they're very,\n\n36:42.920 --> 36:44.120\n I would say slippery.\n\n36:44.120 --> 36:46.440\n They can change hosts really quickly,\n\n36:46.440 --> 36:49.480\n because in any animal harboring an RNA virus,\n\n36:50.440 --> 36:52.960\n like let's say a bat in some cave somewhere,\n\n36:52.960 --> 36:55.160\n it's not just one genome.\n\n36:55.160 --> 36:58.680\n It's millions of different genomes of all kinds,\n\n36:58.680 --> 37:01.240\n all within the framework of, say, coronavirus,\n\n37:01.240 --> 37:02.600\n but they're all different.\n\n37:02.600 --> 37:04.760\n And one genome in there might just be right\n\n37:04.760 --> 37:08.200\n for infecting a person if it ever encountered that person.\n\n37:08.200 --> 37:09.400\n I mean, that's the thing that.\n\n37:09.400 --> 37:11.240\n Or there could be a large number.\n\n37:11.240 --> 37:15.000\n This is a tiny fraction, but a large number of them.\n\n37:15.000 --> 37:18.280\n And they're all operating at the threshold of error.\n\n37:18.280 --> 37:19.120\n That's fascinating.\n\n37:19.120 --> 37:21.560\n It's like little, like it's like startups,\n\n37:21.560 --> 37:23.840\n little entrepreneurs, like a startup world.\n\n37:23.840 --> 37:25.160\n Yes, and many of them fail.\n\n37:25.160 --> 37:26.000\n Yeah, many of them fail.\n\n37:26.000 --> 37:26.840\n Many of the changes fail.\n\n37:26.840 --> 37:29.200\n And then there's the DNA viruses that are like the IBM\n\n37:29.200 --> 37:30.520\n and the Google. Exactly, exactly.\n\n37:30.520 --> 37:31.720\n The big corporations.\n\n37:31.720 --> 37:32.560\n That's very good, I like that.\n\n37:32.560 --> 37:34.120\n They become conservative with the bureaucracies\n\n37:34.120 --> 37:34.960\n and all that kind of stuff, so they.\n\n37:34.960 --> 37:36.240\n And a lot of baggage.\n\n37:36.240 --> 37:39.440\n Yeah, yeah, it's expensive for them to reproduce, yeah.\n\n37:39.440 --> 37:40.480\n And they don't move quickly.\n\n37:40.480 --> 37:43.760\n Yes, the RNA viruses are the fast moving members.\n\n37:43.760 --> 37:45.400\n So that's what a virus is.\n\n37:45.400 --> 37:48.840\n We call them ovulated intracellular parasites.\n\n37:48.840 --> 37:50.760\n And then I told you there's DNA and RNA,\n\n37:50.760 --> 37:52.880\n but then let's go further.\n\n37:52.880 --> 37:54.720\n The nucleic acid is not naked.\n\n37:56.120 --> 37:59.800\n Because naked nucleic acid in the world isn't good.\n\n37:59.800 --> 38:03.440\n I mean, it existed in the precellular world,\n\n38:03.440 --> 38:07.080\n but there probably weren't a lot of threats to it then.\n\n38:07.080 --> 38:09.640\n Naked nucleic acid doesn't last long in the environment.\n\n38:09.640 --> 38:12.120\n So they're covered, the nucleic acid is covered.\n\n38:12.120 --> 38:13.920\n It can be covered with a protein shell,\n\n38:13.920 --> 38:18.920\n a pure protein shell, or it can have a membrane around it,\n\n38:18.920 --> 38:22.360\n which would be lipids from the host cell.\n\n38:22.360 --> 38:26.160\n So lipids, so it's a fatty membrane.\n\n38:26.160 --> 38:27.760\n Fatty membrane, yeah, so our cells\n\n38:27.760 --> 38:30.440\n are coated with fatty membranes, right?\n\n38:30.440 --> 38:32.480\n Our cells, the outer plasma membrane, right?\n\n38:32.480 --> 38:33.320\n That's the same.\n\n38:33.320 --> 38:34.320\n Viruses can be too.\n\n38:34.320 --> 38:35.720\n So they're kind of like cells,\n\n38:35.720 --> 38:38.600\n but without the ability to do the mitochondria stuff.\n\n38:38.600 --> 38:41.120\n Some are, they don't have nuclei,\n\n38:41.120 --> 38:42.760\n they don't have mitochondria.\n\n38:42.760 --> 38:45.960\n But they do have a nucleic acid, they have a membrane,\n\n38:45.960 --> 38:48.600\n and then of course there's spikes in the membrane\n\n38:48.600 --> 38:51.200\n that allow them to attach to cells.\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:53.320\n And so that completes our two different kinds.\n\n38:53.320 --> 38:55.720\n So they have, they all have like attachment mechanisms,\n\n38:55.720 --> 38:59.240\n like ways to, like keys into the cell.\n\n38:59.240 --> 39:01.280\n They all have to get into cells.\n\n39:01.280 --> 39:05.160\n There are a couple of exceptions though.\n\n39:05.160 --> 39:10.160\n There are viruses of fungi and plants.\n\n39:10.560 --> 39:11.920\n So let's do the fungi.\n\n39:11.920 --> 39:13.520\n Fungi would be like yeast.\n\n39:13.520 --> 39:17.960\n The yeast cell wall is pretty hard to get through.\n\n39:17.960 --> 39:21.200\n So viruses typically don't attach to a yeast\n\n39:21.200 --> 39:22.040\n and get inside.\n\n39:22.040 --> 39:24.880\n Rather, they just live in the yeast forever.\n\n39:24.880 --> 39:27.920\n And they multiply as mostly nucleic acids,\n\n39:27.920 --> 39:30.600\n and as the yeast divide, they go into the daughter cells.\n\n39:30.600 --> 39:31.840\n And that's how they exist.\n\n39:31.840 --> 39:34.920\n Plant viruses, also the plant cell wall\n\n39:34.920 --> 39:39.760\n would be very hard to get across by binding a protein.\n\n39:39.760 --> 39:43.280\n So plant viruses get into plants either by\n\n39:43.280 --> 39:48.280\n pests that inject them in, they're sucking sap out,\n\n39:48.440 --> 39:49.920\n and they inject virus at the same time.\n\n39:49.920 --> 39:52.600\n Or farmers, they have contaminated farm equipment\n\n39:52.600 --> 39:55.800\n and they roll over the plants and introduces viruses.\n\n39:55.800 --> 39:57.680\n So those fungi and plant viruses,\n\n39:57.680 --> 40:00.520\n they don't have this specific receptor binding\n\n40:00.520 --> 40:01.480\n to get them into the cell.\n\n40:01.480 --> 40:03.560\n But everything else, yeah, the virus binds\n\n40:03.560 --> 40:05.360\n to something on the surface, very specific.\n\n40:05.360 --> 40:09.000\n It's taken into the cell because that's what cells do.\n\n40:09.000 --> 40:12.600\n When things bind their exterior, they take it in.\n\n40:12.600 --> 40:14.280\n Because in most cases, it's good.\n\n40:14.280 --> 40:15.800\n It's something they need.\n\n40:15.800 --> 40:17.200\n And so the virus slips in.\n\n40:17.200 --> 40:19.200\n I guess you'd call that a Trojan horse, right?\n\n40:19.200 --> 40:20.040\n Trojan horse.\n\n40:20.040 --> 40:23.280\n It's so hard to not anthropomorphize this whole thing.\n\n40:23.280 --> 40:24.160\n It is hard.\n\n40:24.160 --> 40:26.960\n So obviously, they don't know any of this.\n\n40:26.960 --> 40:29.400\n It's not an actual Trojan horse.\n\n40:29.400 --> 40:32.760\n So they're not getting actually tricked\n\n40:32.760 --> 40:34.600\n in the way humans trick each other.\n\n40:34.600 --> 40:35.720\n No, it's all passive.\n\n40:35.720 --> 40:38.600\n And it's just through so many years of evolution,\n\n40:38.600 --> 40:42.920\n you select something that works, and it continues.\n\n40:42.920 --> 40:44.920\n And what survives then goes on\n\n40:44.920 --> 40:48.280\n with perhaps a slightly different approach.\n\n40:48.280 --> 40:49.720\n I love this idea of passive.\n\n40:49.720 --> 40:52.040\n Of course, according to Sam Harris,\n\n40:52.040 --> 40:54.840\n so for my sufficiently intelligent alien civilization\n\n40:54.840 --> 40:58.080\n observing humans, our behavior might seem passive too\n\n40:58.080 --> 41:00.800\n because they understand fully exactly what we're doing.\n\n41:00.800 --> 41:02.200\n And then there's no free will,\n\n41:02.200 --> 41:04.040\n and we're all just operating in the same way.\n\n41:04.040 --> 41:04.880\n Could be.\n\n41:04.880 --> 41:07.760\n A cell does, but just a much higher level of complexity.\n\n41:07.760 --> 41:11.760\n Yeah, so I love the distinction between active and passive.\n\n41:11.760 --> 41:14.760\n I mean, the point is, I think anthropomorphizing\n\n41:14.760 --> 41:15.880\n to a certain extent is fine\n\n41:15.880 --> 41:17.800\n because it helps people understand.\n\n41:17.800 --> 41:19.520\n But when you start to say,\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:21.040\n I think the virus is doing that\n\n41:21.040 --> 41:24.640\n because then you're putting a human lens on it,\n\n41:24.640 --> 41:26.200\n and you may be wrong.\n\n41:26.200 --> 41:27.040\n Yeah.\n\n41:27.040 --> 41:29.880\n Because you don't know why things happen for a virus.\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:33.400\n So right now, we have variants emerging,\n\n41:33.400 --> 41:35.920\n and people say, well, I think it's because the antibodies\n\n41:35.920 --> 41:38.120\n are selecting for variants.\n\n41:38.120 --> 41:39.080\n That's a good idea,\n\n41:39.080 --> 41:41.440\n but it may not be the only thing that's going on.\n\n41:41.440 --> 41:44.720\n You start imagining them coming to the table negotiating.\n\n41:45.760 --> 41:47.920\n Yeah, you get into trouble with that.\n\n41:47.920 --> 41:49.320\n That's why I tell my students,\n\n41:49.320 --> 41:51.720\n be careful about the anthropomorphizing\n\n41:51.720 --> 41:55.880\n because you're gonna apply your values to a virus,\n\n41:55.880 --> 41:57.040\n and you have different values.\n\n41:57.040 --> 41:58.920\n You're a human, and you have,\n\n41:58.920 --> 42:01.200\n what you think is the reason for this outcome\n\n42:01.200 --> 42:02.280\n may not be right, that's all.\n\n42:02.280 --> 42:04.160\n Just be open minded about it.\n\n42:04.160 --> 42:05.120\n In both directions.\n\n42:05.120 --> 42:07.680\n I actually, one of the things that pushed back\n\n42:07.680 --> 42:10.360\n on this in the space of robotics,\n\n42:10.360 --> 42:12.280\n people, most people in robotics\n\n42:12.280 --> 42:14.560\n try to not anthropomorphize.\n\n42:14.560 --> 42:17.480\n For example, they don't give a gender or a name to robots.\n\n42:17.480 --> 42:20.000\n They really try to see it as a machine.\n\n42:20.000 --> 42:23.840\n And to me, that makes sense in one way,\n\n42:23.840 --> 42:25.440\n but it totally doesn't make sense in another.\n\n42:25.440 --> 42:27.600\n If that robot is to interact,\n\n42:27.600 --> 42:30.720\n operate in the human world and interact with humans,\n\n42:30.720 --> 42:33.880\n we have to anthropomorphize it\n\n42:33.880 --> 42:37.680\n in order to understand, as an engineering problem,\n\n42:38.880 --> 42:42.080\n how should it operate in a human world?\n\n42:42.080 --> 42:46.000\n Now, the difference with viruses, the scale of operation,\n\n42:46.000 --> 42:49.240\n it doesn't make sense to treat them as humanlike\n\n42:49.240 --> 42:51.560\n because the scale of operations is much smaller.\n\n42:51.560 --> 42:54.240\n But with robots, you're in the same time scale,\n\n42:54.240 --> 42:55.280\n the same spatial scale.\n\n42:55.280 --> 42:56.240\n Of course, in the movies,\n\n42:56.240 --> 42:58.480\n they always give them names and personalities, right?\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:00.400\n Yeah, well, yeah, that's the,\n\n43:00.400 --> 43:02.960\n but that's my argument is we should do the same\n\n43:02.960 --> 43:03.920\n when you're trying to solve\n\n43:03.920 --> 43:06.280\n the engineering problem of robotics too.\n\n43:06.280 --> 43:07.760\n It's not just for the movies.\n\n43:07.760 --> 43:08.800\n Well, let me ask you this,\n\n43:08.800 --> 43:12.280\n because you've said, controversially, not really,\n\n43:12.280 --> 43:14.680\n that viruses are not living.\n\n43:17.160 --> 43:18.200\n Defend yourself.\n\n43:19.360 --> 43:20.600\n Are viruses alive or not?\n\n43:20.600 --> 43:22.880\n So I've seen many people say, oh, they have to be,\n\n43:22.880 --> 43:27.160\n they have nucleic acids, they evolve, they mutate.\n\n43:27.160 --> 43:29.560\n That's all true, but they don't do it on their own.\n\n43:29.560 --> 43:32.200\n The particles in my mug are just not doing any of that\n\n43:32.200 --> 43:33.960\n unless they get into a cell.\n\n43:33.960 --> 43:36.200\n So a virus infected cell is alive.\n\n43:36.200 --> 43:37.800\n I totally agree with that,\n\n43:37.800 --> 43:40.800\n because in fact, when a virus gets in a cell,\n\n43:40.800 --> 43:45.280\n it converts it into a virus making factory, if you will.\n\n43:45.280 --> 43:47.240\n It's no longer a cell.\n\n43:47.240 --> 43:48.920\n Some people call it a viro cell.\n\n43:48.920 --> 43:51.200\n I don't really like that, but it's fine.\n\n43:51.200 --> 43:53.000\n So that's what I'm talking about.\n\n43:53.000 --> 43:54.840\n The particle is not alive.\n\n43:54.840 --> 43:57.760\n You can have your virus infected cell as alive,\n\n43:57.760 --> 44:02.160\n but the particle, it just would not do anything forever\n\n44:02.160 --> 44:03.840\n without getting inside of a cell.\n\n44:03.840 --> 44:07.040\n But once it's in a cell, it is alive then,\n\n44:07.040 --> 44:08.200\n but it's no longer a particle.\n\n44:08.200 --> 44:10.720\n It's taken apart and nucleic acid is moving\n\n44:10.720 --> 44:12.920\n around the cell, it's making proteins.\n\n44:12.920 --> 44:14.080\n Eventually it makes new particles.\n\n44:14.080 --> 44:16.440\n And then those particles released from the cell,\n\n44:16.440 --> 44:17.960\n they're not living anymore.\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:21.320\n So it's kind of, I think it's kind of like a spore,\n\n44:21.320 --> 44:25.200\n a spore of a, or a seed.\n\n44:25.200 --> 44:28.120\n Although the seed just doesn't work because the seeds,\n\n44:28.120 --> 44:29.840\n the cells in the seed have the ability\n\n44:29.840 --> 44:31.920\n to make their own energy and so forth.\n\n44:31.920 --> 44:34.400\n But a bacterial spore, and it's the same thing,\n\n44:34.400 --> 44:36.520\n doesn't do anything unless you add water and nutrients\n\n44:36.520 --> 44:37.560\n and then it starts to divide.\n\n44:37.560 --> 44:39.040\n But it doesn't need to get into a cell.\n\n44:39.040 --> 44:40.640\n It's very different from a virus.\n\n44:40.640 --> 44:42.440\n So that's why the particle.\n\n44:42.440 --> 44:45.280\n And when people think of virus,\n\n44:45.280 --> 44:47.320\n they're always thinking of the particle.\n\n44:47.320 --> 44:49.240\n And that's why I say it can't be alive\n\n44:49.240 --> 44:51.320\n because the particle can't do anything on its own.\n\n44:51.320 --> 44:53.360\n But if you think of a virus as an organism\n\n44:53.360 --> 44:55.880\n with a particle phase in a cell,\n\n44:55.880 --> 44:58.360\n then it makes sense to be alive.\n\n44:58.360 --> 44:59.880\n And by the way, when you say particle,\n\n44:59.880 --> 45:01.160\n you're referring to that structure\n\n45:01.160 --> 45:02.000\n that you've been mentioning,\n\n45:02.000 --> 45:03.440\n some parts of the membrane and not,\n\n45:03.440 --> 45:05.600\n that's been called, what is that,\n\n45:05.600 --> 45:06.800\n a virion particle or something?\n\n45:06.800 --> 45:07.640\n Virion.\n\n45:07.640 --> 45:09.120\n So it's what you should have here.\n\n45:09.120 --> 45:10.280\n I'll send you one.\n\n45:10.280 --> 45:11.720\n And then you can refer to it.\n\n45:11.720 --> 45:13.640\n What's the sexiest one to have?\n\n45:13.640 --> 45:17.920\n Like what, in terms of particles to have on a table?\n\n45:17.920 --> 45:21.400\n Well, unfortunately, the ones that you can 3D print.\n\n45:21.400 --> 45:23.520\n Oh, they're not going to be super.\n\n45:23.520 --> 45:26.360\n They're the ones that we know the structures of, right?\n\n45:26.360 --> 45:29.200\n So someone sent me last year\n\n45:29.200 --> 45:32.000\n a 3D model of SARS CoV2, and it's beautiful.\n\n45:32.000 --> 45:34.720\n It's actually cracked open so you can see the RNA\n\n45:34.720 --> 45:36.960\n and the spikes are sticking out.\n\n45:36.960 --> 45:39.760\n And they even put some antibodies sticking onto the spikes.\n\n45:39.760 --> 45:42.760\n And I mean, when I show this on a live stream,\n\n45:42.760 --> 45:43.600\n people love this.\n\n45:43.600 --> 45:45.080\n They go, oh my God, that's beautiful.\n\n45:45.080 --> 45:46.640\n It is, it's absolutely gorgeous.\n\n45:46.640 --> 45:47.480\n I have that.\n\n45:47.480 --> 45:49.520\n I have my virus that I worked on\n\n45:49.520 --> 45:50.840\n most of my career, poliovirus.\n\n45:50.840 --> 45:54.200\n I have a 3D model of that, which I actually just had made.\n\n45:54.200 --> 45:55.040\n It's gorgeous.\n\n45:55.040 --> 45:57.600\n And you can have it made in any color you want, right?\n\n45:57.600 --> 46:01.480\n What would you say is the most fascinating,\n\n46:01.480 --> 46:05.120\n terrifying, surprising, beautiful virus to you?\n\n46:05.120 --> 46:08.400\n So of all the viruses you looked at,\n\n46:08.400 --> 46:10.920\n sometimes when you just sit late at night\n\n46:10.920 --> 46:13.960\n with a glass of wine looking over the sunset,\n\n46:13.960 --> 46:16.240\n which virus do you think about?\n\n46:16.240 --> 46:21.240\n So fulfilling all of those adjectives is hard, right?\n\n46:21.280 --> 46:24.920\n Fascinating, exciting, terrifying.\n\n46:24.920 --> 46:27.120\n Well, the terrifying is an optional one, I think,\n\n46:27.120 --> 46:30.200\n because maybe that puts a lot of pressure.\n\n46:30.200 --> 46:34.240\n See, terrifying, to me, I'm not terrified\n\n46:34.240 --> 46:37.560\n because I think we can handle most viruses.\n\n46:37.560 --> 46:40.720\n As you see with this brand new one that emerged a year ago,\n\n46:40.720 --> 46:42.400\n we can handle it.\n\n46:42.400 --> 46:44.120\n From a virology perspective.\n\n46:44.120 --> 46:45.600\n Yeah, I mean, the human perspective\n\n46:45.600 --> 46:46.840\n is a different story, right?\n\n46:46.840 --> 46:47.840\n That's always an issue.\n\n46:47.840 --> 46:52.840\n But so I think there are a couple of different categories\n\n46:55.120 --> 46:55.960\n of virus.\n\n46:55.960 --> 46:57.400\n You could do the terrifying,\n\n46:57.400 --> 47:00.080\n and I think rabies is a terrifying virus\n\n47:00.080 --> 47:02.360\n because unless you're vaccinated,\n\n47:02.360 --> 47:04.720\n 100% certainty you're gonna die.\n\n47:05.920 --> 47:10.920\n So you get bitten by a rabid raccoon or bat or dog, whatever,\n\n47:11.000 --> 47:15.600\n and there's still 70,000 deaths a year of rabies\n\n47:15.600 --> 47:17.480\n throughout the world because there are a lot of feral dogs\n\n47:17.480 --> 47:19.080\n running around that are infected.\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:21.720\n Unless you're vaccinated, you're gonna die.\n\n47:21.720 --> 47:23.120\n There's nothing we can do.\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:24.480\n But we do have a vaccine\n\n47:24.480 --> 47:26.440\n which we can actually give you\n\n47:26.440 --> 47:27.800\n even after you've been bitten,\n\n47:27.800 --> 47:31.120\n which is the only vaccine that works that way.\n\n47:31.120 --> 47:32.880\n It's a therapeutic, right?\n\n47:32.880 --> 47:34.840\n It will treat your illness\n\n47:34.840 --> 47:37.340\n because the disease takes so long to develop.\n\n47:38.720 --> 47:41.240\n Eventually, you get all kinds of neurological issues\n\n47:41.240 --> 47:44.800\n and paralysis and so forth, but it takes time,\n\n47:44.800 --> 47:45.960\n and you can be vaccinated.\n\n47:45.960 --> 47:47.440\n It will prevent that in the meanwhile.\n\n47:47.440 --> 47:48.400\n So people always say,\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:50.280\n what's the most lethal virus?\n\n47:50.280 --> 47:51.120\n Is it Ebola?\n\n47:51.120 --> 47:53.600\n I said, no, it's actually rabies.\n\n47:53.600 --> 47:56.000\n Unless you're vaccinated, it will kill you.\n\n47:56.000 --> 47:57.800\n Maybe it's good to linger,\n\n47:57.800 --> 48:01.160\n because we'll talk about vaccines a few times today.\n\n48:01.160 --> 48:04.240\n It's good to linger on cases\n\n48:04.240 --> 48:06.560\n where vaccines have clearly,\n\n48:09.040 --> 48:12.280\n undoubtedly helped human civilization.\n\n48:12.280 --> 48:15.400\n And it seems like rabies is a good example.\n\n48:15.400 --> 48:19.000\n Oh, rabies is great because everyone knows what happens\n\n48:19.000 --> 48:21.400\n when somebody gets rabies, right?\n\n48:21.400 --> 48:24.460\n You have fear of water, hydrophobia.\n\n48:26.160 --> 48:31.160\n Your body becomes spastic and stiff and jerks around,\n\n48:31.320 --> 48:33.600\n and you lose consciousness.\n\n48:33.600 --> 48:35.520\n You can't, no more.\n\n48:35.520 --> 48:36.640\n It's not a fun ride to death.\n\n48:36.640 --> 48:37.480\n It's horrible.\n\n48:37.480 --> 48:39.200\n It's a horrible way to die.\n\n48:39.200 --> 48:40.880\n So I think most people know that.\n\n48:40.880 --> 48:44.080\n It's been popularized enough in media, right?\n\n48:44.080 --> 48:47.060\n So that nobody would probably object to getting,\n\n48:47.060 --> 48:51.000\n oh, I was just bit by this raccoon and it ran off.\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:53.000\n Okay, well, we should assume it's rabid.\n\n48:53.000 --> 48:54.200\n We should immunize you.\n\n48:54.200 --> 48:56.320\n And most people are okay with that,\n\n48:56.320 --> 48:57.560\n because they know the consequences.\n\n48:57.560 --> 48:59.880\n And it's also pretty rare, right?\n\n48:59.880 --> 49:02.120\n It's not like something that you're trying to get\n\n49:02.120 --> 49:06.920\n into the arms of 250, 300 million Americans.\n\n49:06.920 --> 49:07.920\n That's hard.\n\n49:07.920 --> 49:11.680\n But the few thousand every year, it's easy.\n\n49:11.680 --> 49:13.800\n So the transmissibility is difficult, right?\n\n49:13.800 --> 49:16.640\n It has to, oh, it's not airborne.\n\n49:16.640 --> 49:17.480\n It's not airborne.\n\n49:17.480 --> 49:19.880\n It's just you have to be bitten.\n\n49:19.880 --> 49:24.760\n Although some people claim you could walk into a cave\n\n49:24.760 --> 49:28.340\n and the bats breathing out rabies virus could infect you,\n\n49:28.340 --> 49:32.600\n but I don't really think that's well substantiated.\n\n49:32.600 --> 49:33.440\n I think it's a bite.\n\n49:33.440 --> 49:34.800\n How would you do a study on that?\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:36.360\n Yeah, it's very hard to do.\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:38.440\n You'd have to collect the vapors in the cave\n\n49:38.440 --> 49:40.760\n and show that they're infectious, which,\n\n49:40.760 --> 49:43.200\n and by the way, someone emailed me the other day.\n\n49:43.200 --> 49:44.260\n You'll like this.\n\n49:44.260 --> 49:45.760\n They say, why can't we just immunize\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:49.280\n all the bats in the world against these viruses?\n\n49:49.280 --> 49:50.500\n And I said, well, how would you do that?\n\n49:50.500 --> 49:52.320\n There are caves everywhere, right?\n\n49:52.320 --> 49:53.240\n Yeah.\n\n49:53.240 --> 49:56.580\n He said, well, maybe you could just go and aerosolize.\n\n49:56.580 --> 49:57.420\n Yeah.\n\n49:57.420 --> 49:58.440\n It's pretty dangerous.\n\n49:58.440 --> 50:01.480\n And then all the bats should have vaccine passports\n\n50:01.480 --> 50:02.320\n to make sure that they're all.\n\n50:02.320 --> 50:03.840\n Yeah, and I said, you have to get their consent\n\n50:03.840 --> 50:05.340\n before you do it.\n\n50:05.340 --> 50:10.340\n But we do immunize wildlife against rabies.\n\n50:12.060 --> 50:15.040\n We have rabies vaccines for wild animals.\n\n50:15.040 --> 50:17.400\n There are a whole bunch of them that get rabies.\n\n50:17.400 --> 50:19.760\n And we put it in bait\n\n50:19.760 --> 50:21.560\n and drop it from helicopters in the woods\n\n50:21.560 --> 50:25.160\n and it drops down the incidence of rabies in people.\n\n50:25.160 --> 50:27.120\n People hiking, get bitten and so forth,\n\n50:27.120 --> 50:28.000\n it drops the incidence.\n\n50:28.000 --> 50:29.000\n So we can do that.\n\n50:29.000 --> 50:30.320\n I didn't know that.\n\n50:30.320 --> 50:32.200\n I always wondered how much medical care\n\n50:32.200 --> 50:34.020\n are we doing for animals in the wild\n\n50:34.020 --> 50:37.480\n because I've recently become more and more aware\n\n50:37.480 --> 50:42.000\n that animals are living in extreme poverty, right?\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:45.360\n Like you don't know, you think like natural, it's great.\n\n50:45.360 --> 50:50.360\n Like when animals are living on a farm, it's terrible.\n\n50:51.800 --> 50:53.720\n But then you also have to compare to like\n\n50:53.720 --> 50:56.320\n what life is like in the, or like the zoo.\n\n50:56.320 --> 50:58.760\n You have to compare what life is like in the wild.\n\n50:58.760 --> 51:01.600\n Well, the life in the wild is very tough, I think.\n\n51:01.600 --> 51:03.760\n Most animals have to, well, the carnivores anyway,\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:06.160\n they have to catch their food every day, right?\n\n51:06.160 --> 51:08.200\n And then there's the viruses there.\n\n51:08.200 --> 51:09.200\n Yeah, viruses as well.\n\n51:09.200 --> 51:14.200\n So the rabies immunization is the only one I'm aware of\n\n51:14.200 --> 51:16.360\n for wild animals.\n\n51:17.480 --> 51:20.640\n We do immunize lots of other animals.\n\n51:20.640 --> 51:24.960\n So we immunize chickens and pigs and cows,\n\n51:24.960 --> 51:26.600\n even fish, farmed fish.\n\n51:26.600 --> 51:30.080\n We pick each fish up and give it an injection,\n\n51:30.080 --> 51:32.520\n you know, when it's a small fish.\n\n51:32.520 --> 51:36.220\n But that's mostly so that the farmers get a good yield.\n\n51:36.220 --> 51:38.400\n We don't really care about the animals, right?\n\n51:38.400 --> 51:41.040\n We want a good yield for market.\n\n51:41.040 --> 51:46.040\n And then there's some examples where we immunize animals\n\n51:46.080 --> 51:49.000\n to prevent spillovers into people.\n\n51:50.000 --> 51:53.360\n So there's a disease called Hendra in Australia,\n\n51:53.360 --> 51:57.560\n which was discovered in the 90s.\n\n51:57.560 --> 51:59.720\n And it turns out that there are bats, fruit bats,\n\n51:59.720 --> 52:02.460\n that have this virus, and the bats are fine,\n\n52:02.460 --> 52:05.180\n but sometimes they fly into horse stalls\n\n52:05.180 --> 52:06.720\n and the horses get infected.\n\n52:06.720 --> 52:09.040\n In Australia, it was initially racehorses,\n\n52:09.040 --> 52:11.240\n which are very expensive, right?\n\n52:11.240 --> 52:12.880\n The horses got infected and they died,\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:15.080\n and the humans who would take care of them would die also.\n\n52:15.080 --> 52:19.280\n So now they immunize the horses to prevent the,\n\n52:19.280 --> 52:20.400\n well, to save the horses.\n\n52:20.400 --> 52:21.600\n Probably that's the motivation,\n\n52:21.600 --> 52:23.880\n because these horses are hundreds of thousands of dollars,\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:24.720\n right?\n\n52:24.720 --> 52:25.800\n And then the people don't get sick\n\n52:25.800 --> 52:27.440\n because the horses don't get sick.\n\n52:27.440 --> 52:29.360\n You don't want to immunize all the people\n\n52:29.360 --> 52:30.360\n because it's too rare.\n\n52:30.360 --> 52:33.960\n But that approach is called the one world health approach,\n\n52:33.960 --> 52:37.240\n which means everything's connected on the planet.\n\n52:37.240 --> 52:39.320\n And we have to think of everything in the grander scheme,\n\n52:39.320 --> 52:40.960\n not just us.\n\n52:40.960 --> 52:42.920\n Yeah, so you can immunize some things\n\n52:42.920 --> 52:45.000\n along the trajectory that a virus would take.\n\n52:45.000 --> 52:45.840\n Exactly.\n\n52:45.840 --> 52:48.240\n Some living beings.\n\n52:48.240 --> 52:49.880\n In the Arabian Peninsula,\n\n52:49.880 --> 52:52.640\n they have a MERS coronavirus issue every month.\n\n52:52.640 --> 52:55.840\n There are a couple of cases where a camel\n\n52:55.840 --> 52:59.200\n will infect a human, and the human can get very sick.\n\n52:59.200 --> 53:03.200\n It's a respiratory disease, very much like COVID.\n\n53:03.200 --> 53:05.840\n And so camels are very common there.\n\n53:05.840 --> 53:10.520\n They're raced, they're used as pets, they're eaten.\n\n53:10.520 --> 53:12.560\n So there's a lot of human camel contact.\n\n53:12.560 --> 53:15.120\n But the number of cases are rare, two a month.\n\n53:15.120 --> 53:16.760\n So you don't want to immunize all the humans.\n\n53:16.760 --> 53:18.960\n So the idea would be to immunize the camels.\n\n53:20.320 --> 53:21.160\n So.\n\n53:21.160 --> 53:22.000\n I like it.\n\n53:22.000 --> 53:23.720\n So, okay, so you put rabies.\n\n53:23.720 --> 53:28.720\n But Ebola also is a famously deadly one.\n\n53:30.120 --> 53:30.960\n What is it?\n\n53:30.960 --> 53:33.240\n It kills like, I don't know, 50%, 60% of its.\n\n53:33.240 --> 53:37.120\n It could be 50 to 90, but that's in Africa,\n\n53:37.120 --> 53:38.840\n where the healthcare isn't great.\n\n53:38.840 --> 53:42.880\n You saw when the cases of Ebola came to the U.S.,\n\n53:42.880 --> 53:43.800\n we could take care of it.\n\n53:43.800 --> 53:45.160\n We knew how to take care of it.\n\n53:45.160 --> 53:46.800\n We had fancy hospitals and so forth,\n\n53:46.800 --> 53:49.960\n and now we have a vaccine, so we can.\n\n53:49.960 --> 53:52.280\n And the vaccine is really good,\n\n53:52.280 --> 53:54.960\n but there are many governments in Africa\n\n53:54.960 --> 53:56.960\n that are suspicious of us,\n\n53:56.960 --> 53:58.960\n and they don't want to use our vaccine, so they.\n\n53:58.960 --> 54:00.640\n So there's a vaccine for Ebola.\n\n54:00.640 --> 54:01.480\n There is, yeah.\n\n54:01.480 --> 54:04.520\n And the effectiveness and safety of it,\n\n54:04.520 --> 54:06.400\n to how much is understood.\n\n54:06.400 --> 54:08.480\n So this is difficult,\n\n54:08.480 --> 54:11.880\n because there's not a lot of Ebola, right?\n\n54:11.880 --> 54:14.040\n It's not a continuous, ongoing thing.\n\n54:14.040 --> 54:16.560\n There are sporadic outbreaks here and there.\n\n54:16.560 --> 54:17.640\n Of a few thousand people.\n\n54:17.640 --> 54:19.840\n At most, at most, usually a few hundred.\n\n54:19.840 --> 54:23.000\n And the biggest ever, in fact,\n\n54:23.000 --> 54:25.440\n this is why we didn't for years have an Ebola vaccine.\n\n54:25.440 --> 54:27.880\n The U.S. military, together with Canada,\n\n54:27.880 --> 54:30.560\n developed an Ebola vaccine for service people, right?\n\n54:30.560 --> 54:32.120\n They wanted to say, well, we're sending people\n\n54:32.120 --> 54:34.680\n into these Ebola areas, we want a vaccine for them.\n\n54:34.680 --> 54:38.120\n So they had developed it through all the preclinical,\n\n54:38.120 --> 54:40.960\n which means before it goes into people.\n\n54:40.960 --> 54:43.240\n And that stopped, because there was no money\n\n54:43.240 --> 54:46.320\n to do a phase one and a phase two and a phase three.\n\n54:46.320 --> 54:47.800\n In fact, for phase two and three,\n\n54:47.800 --> 54:49.480\n you need to have infections going on,\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:50.760\n because you're looking at how well\n\n54:50.760 --> 54:52.960\n the vaccine prevents infections, right?\n\n54:52.960 --> 54:57.000\n So then there was a West African outbreak in 2015.\n\n54:57.000 --> 54:58.680\n 2013, 2015.\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:00.720\n The most cases ever, 25,000.\n\n55:00.720 --> 55:02.440\n So they got to test the vaccine.\n\n55:03.640 --> 55:07.400\n But they only put it in a few thousand people.\n\n55:07.400 --> 55:10.480\n It's not like it's been in hundreds of thousands of people\n\n55:10.480 --> 55:12.080\n like the COVID vaccines has been.\n\n55:12.080 --> 55:15.720\n So it looks like it has high efficacy.\n\n55:16.600 --> 55:18.560\n But we'd like to have more data.\n\n55:18.560 --> 55:21.440\n Side effects maybe are not so great.\n\n55:21.440 --> 55:23.560\n There are a couple of different available vaccines.\n\n55:23.560 --> 55:25.840\n Some have been tested more than others.\n\n55:25.840 --> 55:29.760\n I would say this would probably not be widely accepted\n\n55:29.760 --> 55:31.440\n in the US.\n\n55:31.440 --> 55:36.440\n But then neither would be something over 50%\n\n55:36.840 --> 55:38.440\n deadliness of a virus.\n\n55:38.440 --> 55:41.240\n No, I think if you were, in fact, many physicians\n\n55:41.240 --> 55:43.280\n work in countries that have Ebola,\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:45.960\n so they get vaccinated, because they understand the choice.\n\n55:45.960 --> 55:48.480\n Yeah, right, it's always about the choice.\n\n55:48.480 --> 55:49.400\n So.\n\n55:49.400 --> 55:50.680\n So then one more thing.\n\n55:50.680 --> 55:53.200\n To answer the interesting,\n\n55:53.200 --> 55:57.000\n what are some of the viruses you really are fascinated by?\n\n55:57.000 --> 56:01.240\n There are a number of viruses that have clearly been shown\n\n56:01.240 --> 56:04.600\n to alter host behavior, and that's how they spread.\n\n56:04.600 --> 56:05.840\n I think those are fascinating.\n\n56:05.840 --> 56:09.960\n For example, there are some viruses of plants\n\n56:11.080 --> 56:13.400\n that are spread by aphids.\n\n56:14.920 --> 56:16.760\n And the aphid bites the plant,\n\n56:16.760 --> 56:18.880\n the virus reproduces in the plant,\n\n56:18.880 --> 56:21.640\n and it somehow engineers the plant\n\n56:21.640 --> 56:26.440\n to give off volatile organics to attract more aphids,\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:28.040\n which will spread the virus.\n\n56:30.080 --> 56:31.440\n Isn't that amazing?\n\n56:31.440 --> 56:32.280\n Yeah.\n\n56:32.280 --> 56:33.960\n So that's altering the behavior.\n\n56:35.080 --> 56:38.640\n Altering because somehow the virus infecting the plant cells\n\n56:38.640 --> 56:40.760\n gives off these organics and attracts aphids.\n\n56:40.760 --> 56:44.720\n And furthermore, somehow when the aphid bites,\n\n56:44.720 --> 56:46.280\n it tastes horrible.\n\n56:46.280 --> 56:48.400\n So they immediately leave with the virus\n\n56:48.400 --> 56:51.240\n they've just picked up and go to another plant to spread it.\n\n56:51.240 --> 56:53.760\n So they're attracted and then repulsed at the same time.\n\n56:53.760 --> 56:55.920\n And obviously you don't want to anthropomorphize this\n\n56:55.920 --> 56:57.560\n like a strategy they're taking on.\n\n56:57.560 --> 56:58.680\n Somehow this worked out.\n\n56:58.680 --> 56:59.840\n It worked out this way.\n\n56:59.840 --> 57:00.680\n It just evolved.\n\n57:00.680 --> 57:04.280\n And you know, evolution is sometimes hard to trace, right?\n\n57:04.280 --> 57:06.320\n Like Darwin famously said,\n\n57:06.320 --> 57:08.240\n he could never figure out how an eye evolved\n\n57:08.240 --> 57:09.320\n from a single cell, right?\n\n57:09.320 --> 57:11.160\n But it did.\n\n57:11.160 --> 57:16.120\n The more complicated, complex the holistic organism is\n\n57:16.120 --> 57:18.120\n that the virus invades,\n\n57:18.120 --> 57:21.360\n the less able it is to control that organism, right?\n\n57:21.360 --> 57:22.600\n So I wonder if there's viruses\n\n57:22.600 --> 57:24.480\n that can control human behavior,\n\n57:26.800 --> 57:31.360\n you know, to induce more spread of the virus.\n\n57:32.880 --> 57:34.320\n Well, I don't see why not.\n\n57:34.320 --> 57:35.160\n There's not enough humans\n\n57:35.160 --> 57:37.080\n that's supposed to like evolve through.\n\n57:37.080 --> 57:39.240\n Well, we can't do the experiment to test it, right?\n\n57:39.240 --> 57:40.080\n We have to observe.\n\n57:40.080 --> 57:41.720\n And that's always hard when you're observing\n\n57:41.720 --> 57:45.040\n because there's so many things that can confound\n\n57:45.040 --> 57:45.880\n what you're looking at.\n\n57:45.880 --> 57:47.520\n Yeah, change human behavior, yeah.\n\n57:47.520 --> 57:50.360\n I mean, there's so many things that impinge on our behavior,\n\n57:50.360 --> 57:54.960\n but yeah, I think it's possible.\n\n57:54.960 --> 57:56.520\n I think it's highly possible.\n\n57:56.520 --> 57:58.000\n If it does it in a plant,\n\n57:58.000 --> 58:00.800\n why not change some other organism's behavior?\n\n58:00.800 --> 58:01.640\n I think it's fine.\n\n58:01.640 --> 58:02.480\n Anyway, those fascinate me.\n\n58:02.480 --> 58:06.080\n There are lots of examples of those that are fascinating\n\n58:06.080 --> 58:08.840\n and how they work, people are trying to figure out.\n\n58:08.840 --> 58:10.680\n But there's not a lot of money to work on, you know,\n\n58:10.680 --> 58:13.560\n insect and plant viruses unless you're going to the USDA.\n\n58:13.560 --> 58:17.120\n So they don't get a lot of work moving forward.\n\n58:17.120 --> 58:19.800\n Well, is there, if you understand some of those viruses,\n\n58:19.800 --> 58:23.760\n is that transferable to human viruses, that understanding?\n\n58:23.760 --> 58:25.560\n I think some of it could be, sure.\n\n58:25.560 --> 58:28.160\n I think the general principles, for example,\n\n58:28.160 --> 58:32.280\n how does the virus cause volatile organics to be made?\n\n58:32.280 --> 58:34.960\n It must be turning on some genes\n\n58:34.960 --> 58:37.400\n and you could learn principles from that,\n\n58:37.400 --> 58:38.720\n how the virus might do that.\n\n58:38.720 --> 58:41.320\n Sure, I think everything is broadly applicable.\n\n58:41.320 --> 58:46.200\n So to say it's not useful to study viruses of insects\n\n58:46.200 --> 58:49.280\n and plants is just wrong because in science,\n\n58:49.280 --> 58:52.880\n we probably know this, maybe in your field it's the same.\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:55.040\n If you're curious, you're going to run into interesting\n\n58:55.040 --> 58:57.160\n things that you never planned on, right?\n\n58:57.160 --> 58:59.680\n That's why people like, you can criticize,\n\n58:59.680 --> 59:01.280\n why do we want to go on Mars?\n\n59:01.280 --> 59:03.560\n Why do we want to colonize Mars?\n\n59:03.560 --> 59:06.600\n Well, it's like, why do you want to go to the moon?\n\n59:06.600 --> 59:10.520\n The reality is when you do really difficult things,\n\n59:10.520 --> 59:13.080\n engineering things, like all these inventions\n\n59:13.080 --> 59:14.320\n along the way are created.\n\n59:14.320 --> 59:16.080\n It's kind of fascinating.\n\n59:16.080 --> 59:21.080\n Basically just pick a thing that everyone can agree\n\n59:21.120 --> 59:24.440\n is kind of cool and is really hard and do that.\n\n59:24.440 --> 59:26.920\n And then you'll have like thousands of inventions\n\n59:26.920 --> 59:28.200\n that have nothing to do with the thing.\n\n59:28.200 --> 59:29.040\n That's right.\n\n59:29.040 --> 59:32.040\n I think you should let curious scientists\n\n59:32.040 --> 59:34.440\n just follow what they're interested in\n\n59:34.440 --> 59:35.280\n to a certain extent.\n\n59:35.280 --> 59:38.880\n You can't, in science we say we have translational research\n\n59:38.880 --> 59:40.200\n where we say, okay, here's some money,\n\n59:40.200 --> 59:43.600\n go cure cancer or diabetes or heart disease, whatever.\n\n59:43.600 --> 59:44.520\n And that's fine.\n\n59:44.520 --> 59:46.680\n But that often doesn't work out very well.\n\n59:46.680 --> 59:49.840\n What works better is to say, you have a good lab,\n\n59:49.840 --> 59:50.800\n you have a good track record,\n\n59:50.800 --> 59:52.960\n here's some money, here's something.\n\n59:52.960 --> 59:56.840\n And that's where PCR, CRISPR, recombinant DNA,\n\n59:56.840 --> 59:59.840\n all that stuff which has made the field explode,\n\n59:59.840 --> 1:00:00.760\n that's all it came from.\n\n1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:04.280\n Not from people saying, I want to cure genetic diseases\n\n1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:05.840\n by gene editing, but by saying,\n\n1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:09.800\n what are these repeated things in this bacterium doing?\n\n1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.120\n Yep.\n\n1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:14.640\n Can I ask you a big philosophical question?\n\n1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:17.200\n So there's these deadly viruses\n\n1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:21.520\n that are not very transmissible, Ebola, rabies.\n\n1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:23.800\n And then there's these less deadly viruses\n\n1:00:23.800 --> 1:00:28.800\n that are very transmissible, like COVID,\n\n1:00:29.200 --> 1:00:31.000\n I guess kind of borderline.\n\n1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.560\n But why isn't there super transmissible,\n\n1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:37.120\n super deadly viruses?\n\n1:00:38.360 --> 1:00:40.360\n I think if you compare SARS one and two,\n\n1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.600\n you get somewhat of an answer, right?\n\n1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:45.560\n SARS one was more deadly.\n\n1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:50.400\n In fact, over half of the time when people were infected,\n\n1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:53.440\n they ended up in the hospital because they were that sick.\n\n1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:57.400\n And then the peak of virus shedding from them\n\n1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.640\n happened long after they went in the hospital.\n\n1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:02.760\n So it's easy to contain the infection\n\n1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:04.640\n when you're in a hospital, right?\n\n1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:07.480\n There was not much pre symptomatic\n\n1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:11.360\n or asymptomatic shedding with SARS one.\n\n1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:14.000\n And shedding means you become infectious.\n\n1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.040\n So in a respiratory virus,\n\n1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.160\n you inhale the droplets with the virus\n\n1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:20.840\n and they reproduce in your upper respiratory tract,\n\n1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:22.920\n what we call the nasopharynx, right?\n\n1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.880\n The nose and going back to that little cavity\n\n1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:27.000\n just above your mouth.\n\n1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.440\n So the virus reproduces really well.\n\n1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:30.120\n And then as you talk and sneeze and cough,\n\n1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:32.560\n you expel droplets and then those are inhaled\n\n1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:35.160\n by other people and then they reproduce.\n\n1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:39.640\n And for SARS two, we now know there's a lot of reproduction\n\n1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:42.320\n just before you feel anything, if at all.\n\n1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:45.560\n So there's a lot of shedding and transmission\n\n1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:47.680\n before you get symptomatic.\n\n1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:50.200\n And as many people don't ever get symptomatic, right?\n\n1:01:50.200 --> 1:01:52.840\n So they spread really easily.\n\n1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:55.960\n So that explains why some viruses can transmit\n\n1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:57.360\n a lot better than others.\n\n1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:00.040\n And if one happens to knock you out,\n\n1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:01.400\n then you're never gonna transmit\n\n1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:03.400\n because you're in the hospital like SARS one.\n\n1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:05.840\n But why can't you have both?\n\n1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:08.680\n Why can't you just wait a while before it knocks you out\n\n1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:10.800\n but when it knocks you out, it really kills you?\n\n1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:13.200\n That is a philosophical question, right?\n\n1:02:13.200 --> 1:02:16.640\n Because we could talk about why we haven't observed it.\n\n1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:21.640\n I mean, one issue is that if you're killed too quickly\n\n1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:25.840\n by a highly lethal virus,\n\n1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:27.920\n you're not gonna transmit it very well, right?\n\n1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:31.040\n So Ebola can kill you quite rapidly.\n\n1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.840\n And most of the transmission occurs when people\n\n1:02:35.840 --> 1:02:38.640\n are being cared for at home or in hospitals.\n\n1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:40.440\n The doctors and nurses get the virus,\n\n1:02:40.440 --> 1:02:42.880\n but people walking around, you're not walking around\n\n1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:45.160\n when you have Ebola, you're too sick.\n\n1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:47.360\n You know, you have black, bloody diarrhea,\n\n1:02:47.360 --> 1:02:51.680\n you're vomiting, you're bleeding from your skin\n\n1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:54.360\n and mucous membranes, you're not walking around,\n\n1:02:54.360 --> 1:02:55.440\n you're not going to parties.\n\n1:02:55.440 --> 1:02:57.920\n So I think that's part of it,\n\n1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:00.400\n that if the infection is too lethal,\n\n1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:02.520\n you're simply not a good transmitter.\n\n1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:05.880\n And I think transmission is probably one\n\n1:03:05.880 --> 1:03:09.720\n of the most powerful selection forces for viruses\n\n1:03:09.720 --> 1:03:12.720\n because a virus always has to find a new host.\n\n1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:16.400\n If it doesn't, it's a startup that fails, right?\n\n1:03:16.400 --> 1:03:18.560\n If it doesn't find a new host, it's gone.\n\n1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:22.520\n And so anything that makes the virus transmit better\n\n1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:23.600\n is gonna help it.\n\n1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:27.480\n And if killing you, being less lethal is part of that,\n\n1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:28.360\n that works too.\n\n1:03:28.360 --> 1:03:30.720\n So there's a strong selection pressure\n\n1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:32.360\n against being lethal.\n\n1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.880\n I think there's a strong selection pressure\n\n1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:38.680\n against being lethal and being more transmissible.\n\n1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.600\n Those two seem to work in opposite ways.\n\n1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.440\n And now we don't have a lot of data to support this.\n\n1:03:43.440 --> 1:03:46.520\n This is kind of a thought experiment,\n\n1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:49.600\n but there is one experiment done in Australia\n\n1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:51.840\n many years ago.\n\n1:03:51.840 --> 1:03:54.720\n I don't know if you know this, but in the 1800s,\n\n1:03:54.720 --> 1:03:57.400\n the hunters in Australia imported a rabbit from Europe\n\n1:03:57.400 --> 1:04:00.560\n so they could hunt it because the native rabbit\n\n1:04:00.560 --> 1:04:02.000\n in Australia was too fast for them.\n\n1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:03.440\n They couldn't shoot them.\n\n1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:05.560\n So they brought in this European rabbit\n\n1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:07.800\n and they reproduced out of control.\n\n1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.320\n Within a couple of years, they were everywhere,\n\n1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:13.440\n millions of rabbits in all the watering holes.\n\n1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:14.960\n And now they had a problem.\n\n1:04:14.960 --> 1:04:16.520\n So they decided to use a virus\n\n1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:19.120\n to get rid of these excess rabbits.\n\n1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:22.880\n And they used a virus, a pox virus called myxoma virus,\n\n1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:26.240\n which is a natural virus of a different kind of rabbit.\n\n1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:28.640\n But for these European rabbits, it was quite lethal\n\n1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:30.080\n and it's spread by mosquitoes.\n\n1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:33.840\n So they said, okay, let's release this virus.\n\n1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:38.840\n And the first year, 99.2% of the rabbits were killed,\n\n1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:45.120\n but that 0.8% that were left had some form of resistance.\n\n1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:46.360\n They were variants.\n\n1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:49.040\n Every organism, not just viruses, makes mutants.\n\n1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:51.000\n And there were some variants of the rabbits\n\n1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.760\n that could survive infection.\n\n1:04:52.760 --> 1:04:56.560\n And then in subsequent years, the virus became less lethal.\n\n1:04:56.560 --> 1:04:59.120\n And then the mosquitoes had a better shot\n\n1:04:59.120 --> 1:05:01.120\n of transmitting it from one rabbit to another\n\n1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:02.320\n if the rabbit lived longer.\n\n1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:04.200\n That's the selection probably.\n\n1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:06.520\n And so in the end, the rabbits lived on.\n\n1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:07.480\n The virus was there.\n\n1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:11.440\n It evolved to be more transmissible and less lethal.\n\n1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:12.280\n So that's the only.\n\n1:05:12.280 --> 1:05:13.160\n Life is amazing.\n\n1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:15.080\n That's the only data. Life on Earth is amazing.\n\n1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:15.920\n It is, it is.\n\n1:05:15.920 --> 1:05:19.440\n If you take the time to look at it and see what's happened,\n\n1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:20.760\n it is amazing.\n\n1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.720\n It's also humbling that it just makes you realize\n\n1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.280\n humans are just a small part of the picture.\n\n1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:26.360\n Of course.\n\n1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:28.320\n And we're wrecking it, aren't we?\n\n1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:32.520\n Well, I mean, we're not really.\n\n1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:35.400\n I mean, viruses are wrecking it some ways.\n\n1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:36.880\n We're not really wrecking anything.\n\n1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:38.240\n It's all part of it.\n\n1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:41.480\n But you know, when the ways that humans exist\n\n1:05:41.480 --> 1:05:43.960\n encourages viruses to infect us, right?\n\n1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:45.840\n When we were hunter gatherers,\n\n1:05:45.840 --> 1:05:49.640\n living in bands of 100 people, very few viruses\n\n1:05:49.640 --> 1:05:51.760\n because it was hard for the virus to go\n\n1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:53.200\n from one band to another.\n\n1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:55.840\n And perhaps a hunter would, one of these humans\n\n1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:58.600\n would get an animal and bring a virus into camp\n\n1:05:58.600 --> 1:05:59.560\n and some people would die,\n\n1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:02.160\n but it would never spread to another.\n\n1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:04.480\n And then when we started to congregate in cities,\n\n1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:06.640\n we figured out agriculture and so forth\n\n1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:07.760\n and how to harvest animals,\n\n1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:09.480\n then we could get bigger and bigger populations\n\n1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:10.960\n and the viruses went crazy.\n\n1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:12.560\n And they went from animals to us.\n\n1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:15.120\n So measles went from cows to humans\n\n1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:17.480\n when humans learned to domesticate cows\n\n1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:20.680\n and started gathering in big cities.\n\n1:06:20.680 --> 1:06:24.880\n Yeah, but now that humans are able to communicate\n\n1:06:24.880 --> 1:06:26.960\n and travel globally,\n\n1:06:26.960 --> 1:06:30.240\n the viruses become more and more dangerous, transmissible.\n\n1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:33.960\n Thereby, if you look at earth as an organism,\n\n1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:36.800\n thereby pushing humans to be more innovative,\n\n1:06:36.800 --> 1:06:39.600\n create alpha fold two and three and four and five,\n\n1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:41.800\n create better systems and eventually there's rockets\n\n1:06:41.800 --> 1:06:43.960\n that keep flying from earth.\n\n1:06:43.960 --> 1:06:47.480\n And eventually the virus is becoming super dangerous\n\n1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:49.680\n and threatening all of human civilization,\n\n1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:52.520\n will force it to become a multi planetary species\n\n1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:54.520\n and its organism starts expanding.\n\n1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:57.520\n So I think it's a feature, not a bug, I don't know.\n\n1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:00.720\n Well, I think that we have our early,\n\n1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:03.120\n probably the most of the,\n\n1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:06.120\n we're studying viruses since 1900, right?\n\n1:07:06.120 --> 1:07:09.680\n Most of that time was because of diseases they caused.\n\n1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:12.920\n The first viruses discovered, yellow fever,\n\n1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:17.920\n virus, smallpox, polio virus, influenza virus,\n\n1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:21.520\n those were all because people got sick and they said,\n\n1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:24.560\n oh, look, this is a virus that's associated with it.\n\n1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:28.840\n And so we got good at learning how to take care\n\n1:07:28.840 --> 1:07:31.040\n of these infections, making vaccines and so forth\n\n1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:33.240\n over the years and it's only in the last 20 years\n\n1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.120\n that we recognize that there are more viruses out there\n\n1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:38.240\n that are far more interesting, perhaps,\n\n1:07:38.240 --> 1:07:41.120\n but we've learned how to deal with the bad ones for sure.\n\n1:07:41.120 --> 1:07:43.480\n So we talked about what is a virus.\n\n1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:45.560\n We talked about some of the most dangerous\n\n1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:47.080\n and deadly viruses.\n\n1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:51.320\n Can we zoom in and talk about COVID 19 virus?\n\n1:07:51.320 --> 1:07:52.160\n Sure.\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:54.400\n I don't know what your preferred name is, but maybe for this.\n\n1:07:54.400 --> 1:07:58.360\n Right, the virus is SARS CoV2, which is hard, it's long,\n\n1:07:58.360 --> 1:08:00.440\n and then COVID 19 is the disease.\n\n1:08:00.440 --> 1:08:03.280\n So you could say the virus of COVID 19, that's fine.\n\n1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:04.680\n The virus of COVID 19.\n\n1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:06.240\n But for the purpose of this conversation,\n\n1:08:06.240 --> 1:08:08.320\n we'll every once in a while just say COVID.\n\n1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.480\n It's fine, no problem.\n\n1:08:10.480 --> 1:08:12.760\n What is this virus from,\n\n1:08:14.280 --> 1:08:16.640\n I don't know how many ways we can talk about it.\n\n1:08:16.640 --> 1:08:19.680\n I think from a basic structural,\n\n1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:22.960\n like the variant structure,\n\n1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:25.920\n biological structure perspective, what is it?\n\n1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:28.080\n What are its variants?\n\n1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:30.080\n Can you describe the basics,\n\n1:08:30.080 --> 1:08:32.040\n the important characteristics of the virus?\n\n1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:35.020\n So viruses are classified by humans\n\n1:08:35.020 --> 1:08:38.280\n just to make it easier to keep track of them, right?\n\n1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:42.340\n So this is a coronavirus, which is because\n\n1:08:42.340 --> 1:08:45.160\n when they were first discovered,\n\n1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:48.280\n I think the first ones were animal coronaviruses.\n\n1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:50.440\n They looked at them in the electron microscope\n\n1:08:50.440 --> 1:08:51.960\n and it looked like the solar corona,\n\n1:08:51.960 --> 1:08:53.480\n and that's all there is to it.\n\n1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:56.320\n And I have to say that early in the outbreak,\n\n1:08:56.320 --> 1:09:00.240\n the place with the highest seropositivity in the US,\n\n1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:03.800\n for a while, 68% was a working class neighborhood\n\n1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:05.500\n in New York City called corona.\n\n1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:08.120\n Can you beat that, right?\n\n1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:09.600\n That's crazy, yeah.\n\n1:09:09.600 --> 1:09:12.220\n So coronaviruses, they have membranes, right?\n\n1:09:12.220 --> 1:09:13.160\n We talked about membranes,\n\n1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:15.000\n they have spike proteins in the membrane,\n\n1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.320\n so they can attach to cells.\n\n1:09:16.320 --> 1:09:19.040\n And inside, they have RNA.\n\n1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:22.000\n And they are the viruses with the longest RNA\n\n1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.400\n that we know of.\n\n1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.120\n None other comes close.\n\n1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:29.640\n For some reason, they're able to maintain 30,000,\n\n1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:33.860\n so SARS, COVID, two RNAs, 30,000 bases of RNA,\n\n1:09:33.860 --> 1:09:37.240\n and some of the other coronas are even longer, 40,000.\n\n1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:40.920\n This is a, coronas are family of viruses\n\n1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:45.920\n that included the one you mentioned before, version one.\n\n1:09:46.320 --> 1:09:47.800\n So SARS, COVID one, yeah.\n\n1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:49.640\n COVID one, and I guess other ones as well.\n\n1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:52.520\n So the first, we first learned of them in animals,\n\n1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:56.360\n a lot of animals, pigs, and cows,\n\n1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:58.240\n and horses have coronaviruses.\n\n1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:01.440\n And then in the 60s, we discovered\n\n1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:05.220\n a couple of human coronaviruses that just cause colds,\n\n1:10:05.220 --> 1:10:08.920\n very mild colds that you wouldn't even think twice about.\n\n1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:13.920\n And then suddenly, in 2003, there's this outbreak\n\n1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:18.600\n of severe respiratory disease in China.\n\n1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:21.560\n And it started in November,\n\n1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:24.000\n and they didn't tell the world until February.\n\n1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.220\n And that was really bad, because it was already spreading\n\n1:10:27.220 --> 1:10:30.080\n by the time they told people about it.\n\n1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:34.600\n But this went to 29 different countries.\n\n1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:37.480\n Only 8,000 people were infected, and then it stopped.\n\n1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:42.480\n And that was the first time we saw an epidemic coronavirus.\n\n1:10:43.060 --> 1:10:45.780\n And what they did afterwards is they said,\n\n1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:48.380\n okay, it looks like it came from the meat markets.\n\n1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:50.620\n They have live meat markets in Guangzhou,\n\n1:10:50.620 --> 1:10:53.220\n in the south of China, where you can go\n\n1:10:53.220 --> 1:10:56.440\n and pick out an animal and the guy will slaughter it for you\n\n1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:57.780\n and give it to you, and then of course,\n\n1:10:57.780 --> 1:11:00.580\n there's blood everywhere, and that's how they got infected.\n\n1:11:00.580 --> 1:11:02.760\n And they figured out that there's this animal\n\n1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:05.780\n called a palm civet, that was the source of virus.\n\n1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:08.460\n The palm civets are shipped in from the countryside,\n\n1:11:08.460 --> 1:11:10.660\n and the palm civets somehow in the countryside\n\n1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:11.700\n got it from a bat.\n\n1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:13.900\n So they went looking in caves in the countryside,\n\n1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.860\n and they found in one cave all the viruses\n\n1:11:16.860 --> 1:11:19.140\n that could make up SARS 1.\n\n1:11:19.140 --> 1:11:21.620\n And that was 2000, and I would say,\n\n1:11:21.620 --> 1:11:24.340\n took about five, eight years after that outbreak.\n\n1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:29.340\n So that was the first hint that bats have coronaviruses\n\n1:11:30.040 --> 1:11:32.940\n that can infect people and cause problems, right?\n\n1:11:32.940 --> 1:11:35.620\n And after that, we should have been ready.\n\n1:11:35.620 --> 1:11:37.580\n So didn't they already start developing\n\n1:11:37.580 --> 1:11:38.860\n vaccines after then? Yes.\n\n1:11:38.860 --> 1:11:41.300\n So some people started making vaccines.\n\n1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:46.300\n They tested them in mice, but they never got into people.\n\n1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:50.860\n And some people started working on antiviral drugs.\n\n1:11:50.860 --> 1:11:54.140\n Nothing ever came of them because, you know,\n\n1:11:54.140 --> 1:11:57.460\n industry, there's no disease, it's gone.\n\n1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.420\n Why should we make vaccines and drugs?\n\n1:11:59.420 --> 1:12:02.540\n And NIH in the US, you submit a grant,\n\n1:12:02.540 --> 1:12:03.960\n and they say, ah, it's too risky.\n\n1:12:03.960 --> 1:12:05.520\n There's none of this virus around.\n\n1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:08.180\n So people were really shortsighted because I always say,\n\n1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:13.060\n we could have had antivirals for this, absolutely, for sure.\n\n1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:14.260\n No question.\n\n1:12:14.260 --> 1:12:17.180\n In fact, the one antiviral that's in phase three,\n\n1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:20.220\n it's called molnupiravir.\n\n1:12:20.220 --> 1:12:22.260\n It's the only one that you can take orally.\n\n1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:23.100\n It's a pill.\n\n1:12:23.100 --> 1:12:24.220\n It looks really good.\n\n1:12:24.220 --> 1:12:26.340\n That was developed five years ago,\n\n1:12:26.340 --> 1:12:27.980\n but never taken into humans.\n\n1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:29.340\n It could have been ready.\n\n1:12:29.340 --> 1:12:33.940\n So we dropped the ball, and then the next decade, 2012,\n\n1:12:33.940 --> 1:12:38.900\n MERS coronavirus comes up in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n1:12:38.900 --> 1:12:41.580\n This comes from camels and infects people,\n\n1:12:41.580 --> 1:12:44.820\n but probably the camels got it from bats originally\n\n1:12:44.820 --> 1:12:46.260\n some time ago.\n\n1:12:46.260 --> 1:12:50.580\n But that never transmits from person to person, very rarely.\n\n1:12:50.580 --> 1:12:54.560\n Every new little outbreak is a new infection from a camel.\n\n1:12:55.460 --> 1:12:59.260\n So that was 2012, and now here we are, 2019,\n\n1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:02.680\n the new outbreak of respiratory disease in China.\n\n1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:06.420\n And this one really goes all over the world\n\n1:13:06.420 --> 1:13:07.780\n where SARS1 could not.\n\n1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:09.380\n It's a coronavirus.\n\n1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:11.100\n It's different enough from SARS1\n\n1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:12.940\n that it has very different properties.\n\n1:13:12.940 --> 1:13:13.780\n Causes a lot.\n\n1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:14.620\n But it still has a membrane.\n\n1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:17.820\n It still has a very long RNA in the middle,\n\n1:13:17.820 --> 1:13:19.900\n and then it still has the spike proteins.\n\n1:13:19.900 --> 1:13:20.740\n That's right.\n\n1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:22.460\n What are the things that are,\n\n1:13:22.460 --> 1:13:24.780\n what are the little unique things\n\n1:13:24.780 --> 1:13:27.740\n that make it that much more effective?\n\n1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:30.940\n That make it cause a pandemic of millions of people\n\n1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:32.500\n as opposed to SARS1?\n\n1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:37.500\n Well, the genome is 20% different from SARS1, say.\n\n1:13:38.540 --> 1:13:40.300\n And in those bases, there's some,\n\n1:13:40.300 --> 1:13:42.900\n there are things that make it different from SARS1.\n\n1:13:42.900 --> 1:13:45.580\n It binds the same receptor, ACE2, on the cell surface.\n\n1:13:45.580 --> 1:13:48.020\n So that's remarkable.\n\n1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:50.100\n It has a lot of the same proteins.\n\n1:13:50.100 --> 1:13:50.980\n They look similar.\n\n1:13:50.980 --> 1:13:53.100\n Like if you look at the structure of the spikes,\n\n1:13:53.100 --> 1:13:54.660\n they look similar,\n\n1:13:54.660 --> 1:13:57.020\n but there's enough amino acid differences\n\n1:13:57.020 --> 1:13:58.500\n to make the bio.\n\n1:13:58.500 --> 1:14:00.060\n And what it is, we don't know,\n\n1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:03.200\n because how do you figure that out?\n\n1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:04.900\n You need to study animals,\n\n1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.700\n because you can't infect people.\n\n1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:08.940\n And the animal models aren't great.\n\n1:14:10.220 --> 1:14:11.600\n So the way you figure that out\n\n1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:14.980\n is you figure out how those differences,\n\n1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:16.780\n what functional,\n\n1:14:16.780 --> 1:14:18.540\n like how the difference in the amino acids\n\n1:14:18.540 --> 1:14:20.860\n lead to functional difference of the virus.\n\n1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:21.700\n That's right.\n\n1:14:21.700 --> 1:14:23.180\n Like how it attaches, how it breaks the cell wall.\n\n1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:24.020\n Exactly.\n\n1:14:24.020 --> 1:14:25.700\n And how the hell do you figure that out?\n\n1:14:25.700 --> 1:14:29.980\n Like, I guess there's models of interaction.\n\n1:14:29.980 --> 1:14:33.180\n First, you need an animal of some kind to infect, right?\n\n1:14:33.180 --> 1:14:34.920\n You can use mice.\n\n1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:38.660\n People have used ferrets, guinea pigs,\n\n1:14:38.660 --> 1:14:40.820\n nonhuman primates,\n\n1:14:40.820 --> 1:14:41.780\n all of the above.\n\n1:14:41.780 --> 1:14:43.260\n Nonhuman primates are very expensive,\n\n1:14:43.260 --> 1:14:44.640\n so not many people do that.\n\n1:14:45.740 --> 1:14:48.500\n And then you can put the virus in the respiratory tract.\n\n1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:51.620\n But in fact, none of them get sick like people do.\n\n1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:55.580\n Many people with COVID get a mild disease,\n\n1:14:55.580 --> 1:14:59.620\n but 20% get a very severe, longer lasting disease.\n\n1:14:59.620 --> 1:15:00.780\n They can die from it, right?\n\n1:15:00.780 --> 1:15:03.020\n No animal does that yet.\n\n1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:05.460\n So we have no insight into what's controlling that.\n\n1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:07.500\n But if you just wanna look at the very first part\n\n1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:10.880\n of infection and the shedding and the transmission,\n\n1:15:10.880 --> 1:15:14.620\n you can do it in any one of several animal models.\n\n1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:16.660\n Ferrets are really good for transmission.\n\n1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:19.620\n They tend to have nasal structures like humans\n\n1:15:19.620 --> 1:15:22.780\n and you can put them in cages next to each other\n\n1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:24.900\n and they'll transmit the virus really nicely.\n\n1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.620\n So you can study that.\n\n1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:29.740\n But the other thing that's important that we should mention\n\n1:15:29.740 --> 1:15:32.180\n is how do you manipulate these viruses?\n\n1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:35.720\n So these are RNA viruses.\n\n1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:38.740\n You can't manipulate RNA.\n\n1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:40.820\n We don't know how to do it.\n\n1:15:40.820 --> 1:15:45.740\n But DNA, because of the recombinant DNA revolution\n\n1:15:45.740 --> 1:15:47.980\n that occurred in the 70s,\n\n1:15:47.980 --> 1:15:51.460\n we can change DNA any way we want.\n\n1:15:51.460 --> 1:15:53.680\n We can change a single base, we can cut out bases,\n\n1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:56.960\n we can put other things in really easily.\n\n1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:01.680\n And if I may give it a personal aspect,\n\n1:16:01.680 --> 1:16:05.820\n when I went to MIT as a postdoc in 1979,\n\n1:16:05.820 --> 1:16:09.020\n David Baltimore said, here's what I want you to do.\n\n1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:12.580\n The moratorium on recombinant DNA experiments\n\n1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:14.740\n on viruses has just been lifted.\n\n1:16:14.740 --> 1:16:18.180\n I want you to make a DNA copy of polio\n\n1:16:18.180 --> 1:16:19.820\n and see if you put that in a cell\n\n1:16:19.820 --> 1:16:21.600\n whether it will start an infection.\n\n1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:24.440\n It's okay.\n\n1:16:24.440 --> 1:16:27.280\n So I made a DNA copy of polio virus.\n\n1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:29.360\n It's only 7,500 bases.\n\n1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:31.760\n It's much smaller than corona.\n\n1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:35.560\n And I took that DNA and I put it in a piece of DNA\n\n1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:37.960\n from a bacteria called a plasmid.\n\n1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:41.440\n And you can grow plasmids in many, many bacteria,\n\n1:16:41.440 --> 1:16:44.600\n make lots of them and purify the DNA really easily.\n\n1:16:44.600 --> 1:16:48.680\n And I took that DNA and I sequenced it\n\n1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:50.880\n because we didn't know the genome sequence\n\n1:16:50.880 --> 1:16:52.680\n of polio at the time.\n\n1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.640\n And that took me a year by the way,\n\n1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:57.280\n because the techniques we had were really archaic\n\n1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.000\n and nowadays you could do it in 15 minutes, right?\n\n1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:01.520\n It's amazing.\n\n1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:05.640\n And I took the DNA, I put it into cells and out came polio.\n\n1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:07.980\n So that's the start.\n\n1:17:07.980 --> 1:17:10.720\n Now, since then everybody has taken that technique\n\n1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:11.720\n and used it for their virus.\n\n1:17:11.720 --> 1:17:13.180\n You can now do it with SARS CoV2.\n\n1:17:13.180 --> 1:17:16.000\n You make a DNA copy of any RNA virus,\n\n1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.040\n you can modify it and you put it back into cells\n\n1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:21.440\n and you'll get your modified virus out.\n\n1:17:21.440 --> 1:17:23.780\n So that's an important part of understanding\n\n1:17:23.780 --> 1:17:26.620\n the properties of the virus as, say, in an animal.\n\n1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:28.840\n By changing the virus, you're changing a DNA copy,\n\n1:17:28.840 --> 1:17:32.500\n you're making the virus then and putting it into the animal.\n\n1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:35.360\n Can you clarify, so even in the RNA virus,\n\n1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:38.040\n you can take and turn it into DNA?\n\n1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:38.880\n Yes.\n\n1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:41.000\n And then that allows you to modify it.\n\n1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:41.840\n Yes.\n\n1:17:41.840 --> 1:17:44.240\n What's that mapping?\n\n1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:46.000\n Well, no, no, no, what's the process\n\n1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.320\n of going from RNA to DNA?\n\n1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:49.680\n Reverse transcription.\n\n1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:50.680\n That's reverse transcription.\n\n1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:51.520\n Right.\n\n1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:53.120\n Oh, so you actually go through the process\n\n1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:54.720\n of reverse transcription to do this?\n\n1:17:54.720 --> 1:17:55.540\n Yes.\n\n1:17:55.540 --> 1:17:58.400\n Remember, David Baltimore and Howard had discovered\n\n1:17:58.400 --> 1:18:00.080\n this enzyme in the 70s.\n\n1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:01.720\n They got the Nobel Prize for that.\n\n1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.560\n And when I went to David's lab at MIT,\n\n1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:06.360\n he had the enzyme in the freezer.\n\n1:18:06.360 --> 1:18:08.760\n He said, here, take this and make a DNA copy of polio.\n\n1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:10.160\n Yeah, I didn't make the connection\n\n1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:14.000\n that you can use that kind of thing for an RNA virus.\n\n1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:14.840\n And so that's.\n\n1:18:14.840 --> 1:18:15.880\n And then modify it.\n\n1:18:15.880 --> 1:18:18.200\n See, any DNA virus already exists as DNA.\n\n1:18:18.200 --> 1:18:19.760\n So you can modify it.\n\n1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.280\n But for RNA viruses, it was difficult.\n\n1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.640\n And so then from that point on, for influenza,\n\n1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:28.000\n every other RNA virus and coronaviruses,\n\n1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.840\n people made DNA copies.\n\n1:18:29.840 --> 1:18:31.520\n And that's what they use to modify\n\n1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:34.600\n and ask questions about what things are doing, right?\n\n1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:35.560\n What's this gene doing?\n\n1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:36.400\n What if we take it out?\n\n1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:37.220\n What happened?\n\n1:18:37.220 --> 1:18:39.560\n Can you do the same thing with COVID?\n\n1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:41.160\n Is take the RNA and then.\n\n1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:42.000\n Of course.\n\n1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.160\n And in fact, in January 2020,\n\n1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:47.600\n as soon as the genome sequence was released from China,\n\n1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:52.600\n the labs all over were synthesizing this 30,000 base DNA\n\n1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:54.320\n and getting virus.\n\n1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:58.280\n What can you figure out without infecting anything?\n\n1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:01.720\n Just turning into, with the reverse transcription,\n\n1:19:01.720 --> 1:19:03.560\n turning into DNA, modifying stuff,\n\n1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:05.520\n and then putting it into a cell.\n\n1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:08.360\n What can you figure out from that?\n\n1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:11.640\n Oh, well, you could, let's say you can cut out a gene.\n\n1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:13.280\n You see some genes in the sequence.\n\n1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:14.720\n I don't know what these genes do.\n\n1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:16.040\n Let's cut them out.\n\n1:19:16.040 --> 1:19:18.840\n And then you could cut them out of the DNA.\n\n1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:22.080\n You put the DNA in cells and maybe you get virus out.\n\n1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.440\n And you go, oh, clearly that gene's not needed\n\n1:19:25.440 --> 1:19:27.820\n for the virus to reproduce, at least in cells, right?\n\n1:19:27.820 --> 1:19:29.200\n Or maybe you take the gene out\n\n1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:31.600\n and you never get any virus, so it's lethal.\n\n1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:33.520\n Is there a nice systematic ways of doing this?\n\n1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:35.480\n Do people kind of automate it?\n\n1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:36.320\n Absolutely.\n\n1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:41.080\n And we, I mean, the problem with SARS, the COVID virus,\n\n1:19:41.080 --> 1:19:44.460\n is it's 30,000 bases, a lot of stuff there.\n\n1:19:44.460 --> 1:19:48.480\n And what makes it more difficult is that you have to,\n\n1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:53.480\n it's been classified as a BSL3 agent, biosafety level three.\n\n1:19:55.600 --> 1:19:58.960\n And so not everyone has a lab that's capable of doing that.\n\n1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.760\n So it limits the number of people who can do experiments.\n\n1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.720\n You know, we're lucky to have a few in New York City,\n\n1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:07.520\n but not every place has them.\n\n1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:11.520\n So you cannot work with a virus just out on the bench\n\n1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:13.040\n like we do with many other viruses.\n\n1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:15.800\n You have to wear a suit and have to have special procedures\n\n1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:16.920\n and containment and so forth.\n\n1:20:16.920 --> 1:20:19.240\n So it makes it difficult to do basic experiments\n\n1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:20.080\n on the virus.\n\n1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:22.800\n But when it's a pandemic, there's a lot of money,\n\n1:20:22.800 --> 1:20:25.600\n there's a lot of incentive to work on it harder.\n\n1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:27.360\n And also you don't need to work on the virus.\n\n1:20:27.360 --> 1:20:29.280\n You can take bits of it and work.\n\n1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:31.200\n You could take, say, just the spike, right?\n\n1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.880\n And say, can we make a vaccine with just the spike?\n\n1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:36.800\n Because that doesn't require BSL3, so yes.\n\n1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:40.480\n So like building a vaccine requires you to figure out\n\n1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:44.680\n how, or antiviral drugs, how to attack various structural\n\n1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:47.040\n parts of the virus and the functional parts of the virus.\n\n1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:47.880\n Right.\n\n1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:50.040\n You have to decide on a target.\n\n1:20:50.040 --> 1:20:50.880\n Yeah.\n\n1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:52.360\n Like, I'm gonna make an antiviral,\n\n1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:55.480\n what am I gonna target in the virus?\n\n1:20:55.480 --> 1:21:00.440\n And there are a few things that make more sense than others.\n\n1:21:00.440 --> 1:21:03.400\n Usually we like to target enzymes.\n\n1:21:03.400 --> 1:21:05.560\n I don't know if you remember your biochemistry,\n\n1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:07.840\n but enzymes are catalytic.\n\n1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:10.480\n You don't need a lot of them to do a lot of things.\n\n1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:12.880\n So they're typically in low concentrations\n\n1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:14.360\n in a virus infected cell.\n\n1:21:14.360 --> 1:21:17.120\n So it's easier to inhibit them with a drug.\n\n1:21:17.120 --> 1:21:20.920\n And the coronas have a couple of enzymes that we can target.\n\n1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:23.640\n So you have to figure that out ahead of time\n\n1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.080\n and decide what to go after.\n\n1:21:25.080 --> 1:21:27.320\n And then you can look for drugs that inhibit\n\n1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:28.400\n what you're interested in.\n\n1:21:28.400 --> 1:21:29.940\n It's not that hard to do.\n\n1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.040\n There's just something beautiful about biology,\n\n1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:36.080\n about the mechanisms of biology.\n\n1:21:36.080 --> 1:21:40.040\n And I kind of regret falling in love\n\n1:21:40.040 --> 1:21:41.840\n with computer science so much\n\n1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:46.280\n that I left that biology textbook on the show\n\n1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:47.360\n and left it behind.\n\n1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:49.480\n But hopefully we'll return to it now\n\n1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:51.920\n because I think one of the things you learn\n\n1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:55.080\n even in computer science that studying biology\n\n1:21:56.040 --> 1:21:58.440\n and certainly neurobiology,\n\n1:22:00.080 --> 1:22:02.760\n you get inspired.\n\n1:22:02.760 --> 1:22:05.160\n Here's a mechanism of incredible complexity\n\n1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:07.520\n that works really well, is very robust,\n\n1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:09.520\n is very effective, efficient.\n\n1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:11.800\n It inspires you to come up with techniques\n\n1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:13.760\n that you can engineer in the machine.\n\n1:22:13.760 --> 1:22:15.760\n That's what drives a field forward\n\n1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:20.760\n when people improvise and come up with new technologies\n\n1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:22.720\n that really make a difference.\n\n1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:25.240\n And we have a bunch of those now.\n\n1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.440\n What's the difference between the coronavirus family\n\n1:22:28.440 --> 1:22:33.200\n and the other popular family, influenza virus family?\n\n1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:37.320\n I mean, if I were, because you mentioned\n\n1:22:37.320 --> 1:22:38.480\n we should have done a lot more\n\n1:22:38.480 --> 1:22:39.920\n in terms of vaccine development,\n\n1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:42.320\n that kind of thing for coronaviruses.\n\n1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:46.440\n But if I were back then, from my understanding,\n\n1:22:46.440 --> 1:22:49.840\n the thing we should all be afraid of is influenza,\n\n1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:53.840\n like some strong variants coming out from that family.\n\n1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:57.880\n That seems like the one that will destroy human civilization\n\n1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:00.240\n or hurt us really badly.\n\n1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:02.520\n I don't know if you agree with this sense,\n\n1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:06.520\n but maybe you can also just clarify\n\n1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:09.560\n what to use as the difference between the families.\n\n1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:11.000\n So it's an interesting difference.\n\n1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.440\n They both have membranes, right?\n\n1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:18.080\n So then they have spike proteins embedded in them.\n\n1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.720\n And they're different spikes.\n\n1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.240\n In fact, for influenza, there are two main ones.\n\n1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:26.040\n They're called the HA and the NA.\n\n1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:30.840\n But what's inside is RNA,\n\n1:23:30.840 --> 1:23:33.560\n but it's very different RNA.\n\n1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.640\n And here we have to explain that.\n\n1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:40.600\n So viruses with RNA can have three different kinds of RNA.\n\n1:23:42.080 --> 1:23:44.440\n They can have what we call plus RNA.\n\n1:23:45.480 --> 1:23:48.160\n They can have minus RNA,\n\n1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:49.800\n or they could have plus minus,\n\n1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:54.480\n actually two strands hybridized together.\n\n1:23:54.480 --> 1:23:58.440\n The plus RNA simply means that\n\n1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:01.800\n if you put that plus RNA in a cell,\n\n1:24:01.800 --> 1:24:03.640\n you know, your cell has ribosomes in it\n\n1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:05.720\n that make the proteins that you need.\n\n1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:08.560\n The ribosomes will immediately latch onto the plus RNA\n\n1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:09.920\n and begin to make proteins.\n\n1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:15.280\n A minus RNA is not the right strand to make proteins.\n\n1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:17.160\n So it has to be copied first.\n\n1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:19.560\n And then the plus minus is both together.\n\n1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:22.520\n So the SARS coronaviruses,\n\n1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:25.240\n all the coronaviruses have plus RNA.\n\n1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:26.800\n So as soon as that RNA gets in the cell,\n\n1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:28.440\n boom, it starts an infectious cycle.\n\n1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:31.280\n Same thing with poliovirus, by the way, which I worked on.\n\n1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:34.920\n Influenza viruses are negative stranded.\n\n1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:37.800\n So they cannot be translated when they get in the cell.\n\n1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:40.040\n So that's tough for the virus\n\n1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:45.040\n because the cell actually cannot make plus RNA\n\n1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:47.000\n from minus RNA.\n\n1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.160\n It doesn't have the enzyme to do it.\n\n1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:53.600\n So the virus has to carry it in inside the virus particle.\n\n1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:55.600\n And then when the minus RNA is in the cell,\n\n1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.440\n the virus enzyme makes plus RNAs and those get translated.\n\n1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:00.320\n So it's a big difference.\n\n1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:03.400\n And then in the influenza viruses,\n\n1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.040\n not only is it minus RNA, but it's in pieces.\n\n1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:09.460\n It's in eight pieces.\n\n1:25:09.460 --> 1:25:10.880\n We call that segmented,\n\n1:25:10.880 --> 1:25:14.880\n whereas the corona is in one long piece of RNA.\n\n1:25:14.880 --> 1:25:17.880\n So they're like floating separately?\n\n1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:19.580\n Yeah, so the genes are on separate pieces.\n\n1:25:19.580 --> 1:25:21.800\n They're all packaged inside that virus particle\n\n1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:23.760\n of influenza virus, but they're in pieces.\n\n1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:25.480\n And why that's important\n\n1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:29.320\n is because if two different influenza viruses\n\n1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:31.520\n infect the same cell,\n\n1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:33.760\n the pieces as they reproduce can mix\n\n1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:38.200\n and out can come a virus with a new assortment of pieces.\n\n1:25:38.200 --> 1:25:40.240\n And that allows influenza virus\n\n1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:43.840\n to undergo extremely high frequency evolution.\n\n1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:45.640\n That's why we get pandemics.\n\n1:25:45.640 --> 1:25:47.040\n When we have a new flu pandemics\n\n1:25:47.040 --> 1:25:49.960\n is because somewhere in some animal,\n\n1:25:49.960 --> 1:25:51.880\n two viruses have reassorted\n\n1:25:51.880 --> 1:25:54.400\n and made a new virus that we hadn't seen before.\n\n1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:59.400\n So you're talking about kind of biological characteristics,\n\n1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.640\n but what am I incorrect in my intuition\n\n1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:05.680\n that are from the things I've heard\n\n1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:09.880\n that the influenza family viruses is more dangerous?\n\n1:26:09.880 --> 1:26:12.560\n Like what makes it more dangerous to humans?\n\n1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:16.080\n Well, it depends on the,\n\n1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:19.400\n there are many flavors or vintages of influenza virus.\n\n1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:21.200\n Some are dangerous and some are not, right?\n\n1:26:21.200 --> 1:26:22.560\n It depends on which one.\n\n1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:26.360\n Some like the 1918 apparently was very lethal,\n\n1:26:26.360 --> 1:26:28.280\n killed a lot of people.\n\n1:26:28.280 --> 1:26:30.080\n But more contemporary viruses,\n\n1:26:30.080 --> 1:26:35.080\n we had a pandemic in 2009 of influenza.\n\n1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:39.280\n That wasn't such a lethal virus.\n\n1:26:39.280 --> 1:26:40.640\n We don't know exactly why,\n\n1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:42.280\n but it didn't kill that many people.\n\n1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:43.760\n It transmitted pretty well.\n\n1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:45.200\n Is that the bird flu one?\n\n1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:47.600\n They're all deriving.\n\n1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:49.720\n That one was called swine influenza.\n\n1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:50.560\n Swine, that's right, swine, yeah.\n\n1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.280\n It seemed to have started in a pig,\n\n1:26:52.280 --> 1:26:57.040\n but it had bird, it had RNAs from bird influenza viruses.\n\n1:26:57.040 --> 1:27:00.600\n These viruses are all reassortants of different viruses\n\n1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.040\n from pigs and birds and humans.\n\n1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.120\n But influenza can cause pneumonia\n\n1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.960\n and can kill you as does SARS COVID too.\n\n1:27:09.960 --> 1:27:11.520\n So it depends on the virus.\n\n1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:13.640\n So there is another influenza virus\n\n1:27:13.640 --> 1:27:14.960\n that's currently circulating.\n\n1:27:14.960 --> 1:27:18.600\n So right now we have the 2009 pandemic virus\n\n1:27:18.600 --> 1:27:20.040\n that's still around.\n\n1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:23.840\n And then the 1968 pandemic virus,\n\n1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:25.760\n which was the one before 2009,\n\n1:27:25.760 --> 1:27:27.400\n that one is still around too.\n\n1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.080\n And that's more lethal.\n\n1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:30.360\n And depending on the season,\n\n1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:33.800\n some seasons the 2009 virus predominates,\n\n1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.200\n some seasons the 1968.\n\n1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:38.800\n And when the 68 is around, you get more lethality.\n\n1:27:38.800 --> 1:27:41.680\n So we're living with an influenza family.\n\n1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:43.960\n We haven't exterminated them.\n\n1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.280\n Right, we never will, never exterminate them.\n\n1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:47.120\n Why?\n\n1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:51.080\n Because every shorebird in the world is infected with them.\n\n1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:54.760\n Gulls and terns and ducks and all sorts of things.\n\n1:27:54.760 --> 1:27:59.440\n Why can't we develop strong vaccines that defend against?\n\n1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:02.160\n Oh, we could do that, sure.\n\n1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.880\n But that would not eliminate them from humans.\n\n1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:06.760\n Even if you had the best vaccine,\n\n1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:08.840\n you would never get rid of it in people\n\n1:28:08.840 --> 1:28:12.080\n because there would always be someone who's not vaccinated\n\n1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:14.400\n or in which the vaccine didn't work.\n\n1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:16.600\n No vaccine is 100%.\n\n1:28:16.600 --> 1:28:17.440\n So.\n\n1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:18.680\n Well, you just contradicted yourself.\n\n1:28:18.680 --> 1:28:21.080\n You said the perfect vaccine.\n\n1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:21.920\n So.\n\n1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:23.160\n Imperfect, imperfect.\n\n1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.640\n But then you said, like, even if you had the perfect,\n\n1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:28.960\n yeah, some people wouldn't get vaccinated.\n\n1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:30.440\n But I understand what you mean.\n\n1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:32.640\n But I actually was asking how difficult is it\n\n1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:35.200\n to make vaccines like that for,\n\n1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:36.920\n it seems like it's very difficult to do that\n\n1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:38.840\n for the influenza virus.\n\n1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:42.960\n So it's really easy to make an old school vaccine.\n\n1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:47.480\n So the way the first influenza vaccines were made\n\n1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:51.040\n was actually Jonas Salk worked on them in the 40s.\n\n1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:53.240\n You just grow lots of virus\n\n1:28:53.240 --> 1:28:55.920\n and you grow it in eggs, by the way, chicken eggs.\n\n1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:56.920\n Nice.\n\n1:28:56.920 --> 1:28:57.880\n Literally?\n\n1:28:57.880 --> 1:28:58.720\n Wait, wait.\n\n1:28:58.720 --> 1:28:59.760\n Yeah, chicken, embryonated.\n\n1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:02.760\n So they get fertilized and there's a 10 or 12 day embryo\n\n1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:04.880\n in it and you put virus in it, it grows up\n\n1:29:04.880 --> 1:29:05.720\n and then you harvest it.\n\n1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:08.440\n You get about 10 mls of fluid.\n\n1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:09.560\n And then you take that,\n\n1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:12.400\n you treat it with formaldehyde or formalin\n\n1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:16.560\n and it inactivates the virus so it's no longer infectious.\n\n1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.440\n And you just inject that into people.\n\n1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:19.840\n And that was the first flu vaccine.\n\n1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:22.160\n It was made for the US Army actually.\n\n1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:24.200\n And then it got moved over to people.\n\n1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:27.360\n We still use that old school tech today.\n\n1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:30.640\n So you're taking, can you help me out here?\n\n1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:34.440\n Okay, so this is a good time to talk about vaccines.\n\n1:29:34.440 --> 1:29:36.960\n Okay, so you're talking about,\n\n1:29:36.960 --> 1:29:39.160\n you're taking the actual virus,\n\n1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:42.520\n you put it in an egg, you let it grow up.\n\n1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:44.120\n It's very funny that you put it in an egg.\n\n1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:46.720\n It's very poetic.\n\n1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:51.720\n And then how do you make it not infection,\n\n1:29:52.680 --> 1:29:53.920\n not effective or whatever?\n\n1:29:53.920 --> 1:29:54.760\n Not infectious.\n\n1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:56.640\n Not infectious, is that the right term here?\n\n1:29:56.640 --> 1:29:57.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:58.920\n So how do you make it not infectious?\n\n1:29:58.920 --> 1:30:02.000\n You can treat it with any number of chemicals\n\n1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:05.400\n that'll disrupt the particle so it no longer infects.\n\n1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:09.040\n So that step of disrupting the particle\n\n1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:12.880\n is that very specific to a particular variant particle?\n\n1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:14.840\n No, the same collection of chemicals\n\n1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:16.240\n you can use for all kinds of,\n\n1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:19.600\n and which have been used for SARS CoV2 vaccines also.\n\n1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:20.440\n Same technology.\n\n1:30:20.440 --> 1:30:23.600\n Okay, so what are, there's several things to ask.\n\n1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:25.280\n So you called it old school in a way\n\n1:30:25.280 --> 1:30:27.560\n that's slightly dismissive,\n\n1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:29.960\n like people talk about Windows 98 or something.\n\n1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:34.760\n So is there risks involved with it?\n\n1:30:34.760 --> 1:30:37.320\n Or is it just difficult to produce large amounts?\n\n1:30:37.320 --> 1:30:38.800\n No, it's only, it's,\n\n1:30:38.800 --> 1:30:40.080\n it's very easy.\n\n1:30:40.080 --> 1:30:41.600\n I mean, you could do it in cells and culture,\n\n1:30:41.600 --> 1:30:43.000\n but eggs were convenient.\n\n1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.240\n And in the 1940s, we didn't have cells and culture.\n\n1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:47.240\n We didn't know how to do that.\n\n1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:49.680\n So we had to use something else.\n\n1:30:49.680 --> 1:30:52.280\n It's easy to do,\n\n1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:56.920\n but the process of inactivating the virus with a chemical\n\n1:30:56.920 --> 1:30:59.920\n makes it not the best vaccine you can make.\n\n1:30:59.920 --> 1:31:02.440\n The flu vaccines that we have today,\n\n1:31:02.440 --> 1:31:05.680\n which are mostly based on this inactivation,\n\n1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:08.480\n is called inactivated virus vaccines.\n\n1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:12.280\n Oh, so like the kind of thing\n\n1:31:12.280 --> 1:31:14.920\n it presents to the immune system to train on\n\n1:31:14.920 --> 1:31:19.520\n is not close to the actual virus.\n\n1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:20.480\n Yes, that's what we think.\n\n1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:22.360\n So that's why probably the flu vaccines\n\n1:31:22.360 --> 1:31:24.880\n are just not very good, you know?\n\n1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:29.000\n 60% efficiency at the best, right?\n\n1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:30.040\n Which is not really good.\n\n1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:31.160\n What does it mean?\n\n1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:33.920\n What is the measure of efficiency for a vaccine?\n\n1:31:33.920 --> 1:31:37.440\n Well, it's how it does in the general population\n\n1:31:37.440 --> 1:31:38.800\n at preventing influenza.\n\n1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:40.760\n At preventing?\n\n1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:41.880\n Illness, not infection.\n\n1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:44.800\n We usually don't measure infection\n\n1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:46.040\n when we're testing a vaccine.\n\n1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:47.640\n We just measure sickness.\n\n1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:50.200\n That's really easy to score, right?\n\n1:31:50.200 --> 1:31:52.040\n You do a trial and you say,\n\n1:31:52.040 --> 1:31:53.840\n if you feel sick, give us a call.\n\n1:31:53.840 --> 1:31:55.280\n We'll tell you what to do.\n\n1:31:55.280 --> 1:31:58.040\n So yeah, I mean, what's sickness?\n\n1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:01.520\n Sickness is the presence of symptoms?\n\n1:32:01.520 --> 1:32:04.920\n So this is good time to say what a symptom is, okay?\n\n1:32:04.920 --> 1:32:08.880\n A symptom is what you only can feel.\n\n1:32:08.880 --> 1:32:11.560\n Only you can feel an upset stomach\n\n1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:13.320\n or a sore throat or that sort of thing.\n\n1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:15.160\n It's the lived experience of a symptom.\n\n1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:19.040\n Whereas a sign is something that someone could measure\n\n1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:20.480\n and tell that you're infected,\n\n1:32:20.480 --> 1:32:25.480\n like virus in your nasopharynx or something else, right?\n\n1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:27.080\n Signs and symptoms.\n\n1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:30.040\n And so in a vaccine trial, they tell you,\n\n1:32:30.040 --> 1:32:31.800\n well, if you have any of these symptoms,\n\n1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:35.040\n they give you a paper with the exact symptoms listed\n\n1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:36.840\n to make sure you're picking them up, right?\n\n1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:41.480\n So for flu, it would probably be fever, sore throat, cough.\n\n1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:44.160\n You call them and then they will do a PCR,\n\n1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:46.560\n make sure you've got flu and not some other virus\n\n1:32:46.560 --> 1:32:48.160\n that makes similar symptoms.\n\n1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:53.760\n And then they would say, are you a vaccine or non vaccine arm\n\n1:32:53.760 --> 1:32:55.760\n and count up all the infections\n\n1:32:55.760 --> 1:32:57.680\n and see how the vaccine did, basically.\n\n1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:02.080\n That's so fascinating because the reporting,\n\n1:33:02.080 --> 1:33:03.760\n so symptom is what you feel.\n\n1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:04.600\n Yes, for sure.\n\n1:33:04.600 --> 1:33:09.600\n And certainly the mind has a ability to conjure up feelings.\n\n1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:11.800\n Oh yes, absolutely.\n\n1:33:11.800 --> 1:33:16.080\n And so like culturally, maybe there was a time\n\n1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:20.440\n in our culture where it was looked down upon\n\n1:33:20.440 --> 1:33:23.480\n to feel sick or something like that,\n\n1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:25.080\n like toughen up kind of thing.\n\n1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:28.560\n And so then you probably have very few symptoms\n\n1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:29.480\n being reported.\n\n1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:30.960\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:34.840\n And now is like much more, I don't know,\n\n1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:37.880\n perhaps you're much more likely to report symptoms.\n\n1:33:37.880 --> 1:33:40.800\n Now it's fascinating because then it changes.\n\n1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:43.280\n Oh, it is definitely a perception because for,\n\n1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:46.080\n your symptom may be nothing to me or vice versa, right?\n\n1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.480\n And so when you're doing this,\n\n1:33:47.480 --> 1:33:52.080\n it's a little bit of a imprecise science because,\n\n1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:56.160\n and even it's a cultural thing in some countries,\n\n1:33:56.160 --> 1:33:57.800\n something that would make us feel horrible,\n\n1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:59.200\n they wouldn't even bother reporting.\n\n1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:00.440\n No, I didn't have any symptoms.\n\n1:34:00.440 --> 1:34:03.400\n So it's a little bit imprecise and it clouds the results.\n\n1:34:03.400 --> 1:34:05.800\n So if you can measure things, it's always better,\n\n1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:07.720\n but you start out with a symptom.\n\n1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:11.120\n And if you say, if someone tells you this virus,\n\n1:34:11.120 --> 1:34:15.720\n 20% of the people are asymptomatic,\n\n1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:18.200\n they don't report symptoms,\n\n1:34:19.400 --> 1:34:21.960\n that number is probably not a constant.\n\n1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:24.200\n It depends where you did the study.\n\n1:34:24.200 --> 1:34:26.880\n It could be different in China versus South America,\n\n1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:28.400\n Europe, et cetera, yeah.\n\n1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:29.560\n I mean, I was trying to figure,\n\n1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:32.400\n so I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine\n\n1:34:32.400 --> 1:34:34.560\n and I had zero symptoms.\n\n1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:35.400\n Wow.\n\n1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:37.160\n So, and I was wondering, well, see,\n\n1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:38.760\n but that's my feelings, right?\n\n1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:42.040\n This is not, because I felt fine, I was waiting.\n\n1:34:42.040 --> 1:34:44.040\n Did you have pain at the injection site?\n\n1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:48.360\n No, it was kind of pleasant.\n\n1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:50.280\n You felt nothing the next day, no?\n\n1:34:50.280 --> 1:34:53.360\n Nothing, no tiredness, no exhaustion, no.\n\n1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:56.720\n But see, like I have an insane sleeping schedule.\n\n1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:59.280\n I already put myself through crazy stuff.\n\n1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:03.280\n That said, maybe I was expecting something really bad.\n\n1:35:03.280 --> 1:35:06.760\n Like I was waiting and therefore didn't feel it.\n\n1:35:06.760 --> 1:35:10.200\n But I also got allergy shots\n\n1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:14.600\n and those, I was out all next day,\n\n1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:16.400\n like exhausted for some reason.\n\n1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:20.600\n So that gave me like a sense like, okay,\n\n1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:22.640\n at least sometimes I can feel shitty.\n\n1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:24.440\n That's good to know.\n\n1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:25.280\n Sure, sure.\n\n1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:27.160\n And then with the vaccine it didn't,\n\n1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:29.000\n but the question is like,\n\n1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:32.560\n how much does my mind come into play there?\n\n1:35:32.560 --> 1:35:34.920\n The expectations of symptoms,\n\n1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:39.280\n the expectations of not feeling well,\n\n1:35:39.280 --> 1:35:41.280\n how does that affect the sort of the self reporting\n\n1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:42.120\n of the symptoms?\n\n1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:44.560\n I think it's definitely a variable there,\n\n1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:47.560\n but there's certainly many people that don't feel anything\n\n1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:48.440\n after the vaccines.\n\n1:35:48.440 --> 1:35:51.980\n And there's some that have a whole range of things\n\n1:35:51.980 --> 1:35:54.920\n like soreness and fever, et cetera, yeah.\n\n1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:57.040\n So okay, you were talking about the old school development\n\n1:35:57.040 --> 1:35:58.560\n inside the egg.\n\n1:35:58.560 --> 1:35:59.400\n Right.\n\n1:35:59.400 --> 1:36:02.000\n What's better than that?\n\n1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.420\n So then the next generation of vaccines\n\n1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:07.840\n which arose in the 50s were what we call\n\n1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:11.440\n replication competent, where the virus you take\n\n1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:13.920\n and it's actually reproducing in you.\n\n1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:16.040\n Yeah, that sounds safe.\n\n1:36:16.040 --> 1:36:19.040\n And it can be somewhat problematic, yes,\n\n1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:20.080\n as you might imagine,\n\n1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:22.320\n because once you put that virus in you,\n\n1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.120\n you have no more control, right?\n\n1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:25.720\n It's not like you have a kill switch in it,\n\n1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:28.620\n which actually would be a great idea to put in.\n\n1:36:29.960 --> 1:36:32.200\n Like nanobots, what can possibly go wrong?\n\n1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.200\n No, you could just put something in there.\n\n1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:37.880\n If you added a drug, you would shut it off, right?\n\n1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.880\n And people are thinking about that\n\n1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:43.560\n because now we're engineering viruses to treat cancers\n\n1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:46.680\n and other diseases and we may wanna put kill switches\n\n1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:48.560\n in them just to make sure they don't run away.\n\n1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:50.360\n Oh, interesting, so you can deploy a drug\n\n1:36:50.360 --> 1:36:54.960\n that binds to this virus that would shut it off\n\n1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:56.480\n in the body, something like that.\n\n1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:58.620\n Something like that, yeah, that would be the idea.\n\n1:36:58.620 --> 1:36:59.880\n You'd have to engineer it in.\n\n1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:03.580\n Anyway, these were, the first one was yellow fever vaccine\n\n1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:06.220\n that was made because that was a big problem.\n\n1:37:06.220 --> 1:37:09.640\n And this virus, and the way you do this,\n\n1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:12.640\n back in the old day was empirical.\n\n1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:15.280\n So Max Tyler, who did the yellow fever vaccine,\n\n1:37:15.280 --> 1:37:18.580\n he took the virus, which is a human virus, right?\n\n1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:23.780\n And he infected, I think he used chick embryos.\n\n1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:27.340\n And he went from one embryo to another and just kept passing\n\n1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:29.320\n and he did that hundreds of times.\n\n1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:32.680\n And every 10 passages, he would take the virus\n\n1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:36.560\n and put it in a mouse or a monkey, whatever his model was.\n\n1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:38.040\n And then eventually he got a virus\n\n1:37:38.040 --> 1:37:41.880\n that didn't cause any disease after 200 and some passages.\n\n1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:43.840\n And then that was tested in people\n\n1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:46.800\n and it became the yellow fever vaccine that we use today.\n\n1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:50.420\n He selected for mutations that made the virus\n\n1:37:50.420 --> 1:37:55.420\n not cause disease, but still make an immune response.\n\n1:37:55.420 --> 1:37:57.620\n So those are called replication competent.\n\n1:37:57.620 --> 1:37:59.480\n We now have the polio vaccine,\n\n1:37:59.480 --> 1:38:03.160\n which was developed in the 50s after the yellow fever.\n\n1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:05.440\n Then we had measles, mumps, rubella.\n\n1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:09.160\n Those are all replication competent vaccines.\n\n1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:12.400\n And you mentioned is that's a good idea.\n\n1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:15.460\n They are all safe vaccines.\n\n1:38:15.460 --> 1:38:18.440\n The only one that has had an issue\n\n1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:21.360\n is the polio replication competent vaccine.\n\n1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:25.960\n It was called Sabin vaccine or oral polio virus vaccine\n\n1:38:25.960 --> 1:38:29.720\n because you take it orally, it's wonderful\n\n1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:31.420\n because you don't have to inject it.\n\n1:38:31.420 --> 1:38:33.280\n This is the perfect delivery.\n\n1:38:34.280 --> 1:38:37.000\n Either intranasal for a respiratory virus\n\n1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.040\n or orally for polio goes into your intestines.\n\n1:38:39.040 --> 1:38:42.920\n It reproduces and it gives you wonderful protection\n\n1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:43.880\n against polio.\n\n1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:47.960\n However, you do shed virus out\n\n1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.760\n and that virus is no longer a vaccine.\n\n1:38:52.760 --> 1:38:55.600\n It's reverted genetically in your intestine.\n\n1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:57.440\n So you can infect others with polio.\n\n1:38:57.440 --> 1:39:00.500\n Take that virus and put it into an animal and give it polio.\n\n1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:05.500\n And in fact, the parents of some kids in the 60s and 70s\n\n1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:08.340\n who were immunized got polio from the vaccine.\n\n1:39:08.340 --> 1:39:11.240\n The rate was about one and one and a half million\n\n1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:13.760\n cases of polio.\n\n1:39:13.760 --> 1:39:15.360\n So it's called vaccine associated polio.\n\n1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:17.040\n And I always argue that\n\n1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:21.180\n we may not have picked the right vaccine.\n\n1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:25.440\n There was a big fight in the US and other countries\n\n1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:27.560\n between the inactivated polio\n\n1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:29.800\n and the infectious polio vaccines,\n\n1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:31.560\n which ones we should be using\n\n1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.980\n because we found out that the infectious vaccine\n\n1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:35.280\n actually caused polio.\n\n1:39:35.280 --> 1:39:38.040\n And eight to 10 kids a year in the US alone\n\n1:39:38.040 --> 1:39:39.800\n got polio from the vaccine,\n\n1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:43.520\n which looking back is really not acceptable in my view,\n\n1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:46.060\n although the public health community said it was\n\n1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:47.560\n to get rid of polio.\n\n1:39:47.560 --> 1:39:51.420\n So now we're close to eradicating polio globally,\n\n1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.960\n but this vaccine derived polio is a problem.\n\n1:39:55.960 --> 1:39:59.200\n So now we have to go back to the inactivated vaccine,\n\n1:39:59.200 --> 1:40:01.440\n which is tough because it's injected.\n\n1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:05.000\n So, okay, so the basic high level,\n\n1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:08.360\n how vaccines work principle is\n\n1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:11.200\n you want to deploy something in the body\n\n1:40:11.200 --> 1:40:13.880\n that's as close to the actual virus as possible,\n\n1:40:13.880 --> 1:40:15.880\n but doesn't do nearly as much harm.\n\n1:40:15.880 --> 1:40:17.840\n And there's like a million, not a million,\n\n1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:19.640\n but there's a bunch of ways you could possibly do that.\n\n1:40:19.640 --> 1:40:20.600\n So those are two ways.\n\n1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.020\n And now of course we have modern ways\n\n1:40:22.020 --> 1:40:25.680\n we can make mRNA vaccines, right?\n\n1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:26.800\n What are the modern ways?\n\n1:40:26.800 --> 1:40:29.160\n I did, you wanna look, mRNA vaccine.\n\n1:40:29.160 --> 1:40:31.140\n So that's one of the, that's the most modern,\n\n1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:33.160\n but even before mRNA vaccines,\n\n1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:36.080\n we learned that we could use viruses\n\n1:40:36.080 --> 1:40:41.080\n to deliver proteins from a virus that you wanna prevent.\n\n1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:43.960\n And so the Ebola vaccine,\n\n1:40:43.960 --> 1:40:46.560\n we took the spike gene of Ebola virus\n\n1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:47.980\n and put it in a different virus\n\n1:40:47.980 --> 1:40:49.560\n and we deliver that to people\n\n1:40:49.560 --> 1:40:52.000\n and that's called a vector vaccine.\n\n1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.560\n And some of the COVID vaccines are vectors\n\n1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:57.680\n of different kinds of most famous are adenovirus vectors\n\n1:40:57.680 --> 1:41:00.440\n carrying the spike gene into the cell.\n\n1:41:00.440 --> 1:41:03.320\n Can you explain how the vector vaccine works again?\n\n1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:08.320\n So we have, we take a virus that will infect humans\n\n1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:11.480\n but will not make you sick.\n\n1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:13.480\n In the case of adenovirus,\n\n1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:16.000\n the years and years of people studying it\n\n1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.720\n has told us what genes you could cut out\n\n1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:20.960\n and allow the virus to infect the cell\n\n1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:22.120\n but not cause any disease.\n\n1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:24.480\n So instead of doing selection on it,\n\n1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:27.400\n you actually genetically modify it.\n\n1:41:27.400 --> 1:41:29.160\n Yes, you modify the vector, yeah.\n\n1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:30.640\n So you're much more precise about it.\n\n1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:31.480\n You're very precise\n\n1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:33.960\n and then you splice in the gene for the spike\n\n1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:37.640\n and then you use that to deliver the gene\n\n1:41:37.640 --> 1:41:39.680\n and it becomes produced as protein\n\n1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:40.920\n and then you make an immune response.\n\n1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:43.200\n And vector is the term for this modified.\n\n1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:47.880\n Right, so we're now using viruses at our bidding.\n\n1:41:47.880 --> 1:41:50.180\n We're using them as vectors, not just for vaccines.\n\n1:41:50.180 --> 1:41:52.380\n We can cure monogenic diseases.\n\n1:41:52.380 --> 1:41:55.560\n That is if you have, if you're born with a genetic disease,\n\n1:41:55.560 --> 1:41:57.840\n you have a deletion or a mutation in a gene,\n\n1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:01.960\n single gene, we can give you the regular gene back\n\n1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:03.720\n using a virus vector.\n\n1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:07.180\n So cancers too, we can cure cancers with vectors.\n\n1:42:07.180 --> 1:42:09.920\n Wow, really?\n\n1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:10.880\n Interesting. Yeah.\n\n1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:12.540\n I think in 10 to 15 years,\n\n1:42:12.540 --> 1:42:15.920\n most cancers will be treatable with viruses, yeah.\n\n1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:16.760\n Wow.\n\n1:42:16.760 --> 1:42:19.640\n And not only can we put things in the vector\n\n1:42:19.640 --> 1:42:21.080\n to kill the tumor,\n\n1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:25.360\n we can target the vector to the tumor specifically\n\n1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:26.840\n in a number of ways.\n\n1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:28.200\n And that makes it less toxic, right?\n\n1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:30.200\n It doesn't infect all your other cells.\n\n1:42:31.100 --> 1:42:34.800\n But it takes time to develop a vector for a particular thing\n\n1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:37.560\n because it requires a deep understanding.\n\n1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:40.880\n Yeah, in fact, we have about a dozen different virus vectors\n\n1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:42.900\n that have been studied for 20 years.\n\n1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:46.320\n And those are the set of vaccine vectors that we're using.\n\n1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:50.760\n So it includes adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus,\n\n1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:54.200\n which is a cousin of rabies, but doesn't make people sick.\n\n1:42:54.200 --> 1:42:57.600\n Influenza virus is being used as a vector\n\n1:42:57.600 --> 1:43:00.200\n and even measles virus.\n\n1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.080\n So we're familiar with how to modify those to be vectors\n\n1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:07.400\n and those are being used for COVID vaccines.\n\n1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:10.560\n And then of course we have the newest,\n\n1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:12.540\n which is the nucleic acid vaccines.\n\n1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:15.220\n So years ago, people said,\n\n1:43:15.220 --> 1:43:17.680\n why can't we just inject DNA into people?\n\n1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:22.320\n Take the spike and put it in a DNA and inject it.\n\n1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:25.240\n So people tried many, many different vaccines.\n\n1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:28.240\n And in fact, there are no human licensed vaccines\n\n1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:29.440\n that are DNA vaccines.\n\n1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:33.040\n Although there is a West Nile vaccine for horses\n\n1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.880\n that's a DNA based vaccine.\n\n1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:38.120\n So if you have a horse, you can give it this vaccine,\n\n1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:38.960\n but no human.\n\n1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:42.560\n Can you clarify, does a DNA vaccine\n\n1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:44.860\n only work for DNA viruses?\n\n1:43:44.860 --> 1:43:46.800\n No, it can work for DNA or RNA.\n\n1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:48.360\n Because remember, for an RNA virus,\n\n1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.700\n we can make a DNA copy of it.\n\n1:43:50.700 --> 1:43:53.760\n And it will still, when you put that DNA in a cell,\n\n1:43:53.760 --> 1:43:55.440\n it goes into the nucleus.\n\n1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:56.680\n Okay, right.\n\n1:43:56.680 --> 1:43:58.440\n So it's, you're just skipping a step.\n\n1:43:58.440 --> 1:43:59.280\n You get proteins.\n\n1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:02.080\n For RNA vaccines, you're giving, okay, I got it.\n\n1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:04.260\n So those didn't work for human vaccines.\n\n1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:07.280\n And there were many HIV AIDS vaccine trials\n\n1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:10.820\n that used DNA vaccines, didn't work.\n\n1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:13.320\n And then a number of years ago,\n\n1:44:13.320 --> 1:44:17.800\n people started thinking, how about RNA, RNA vaccines?\n\n1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:20.280\n And I first heard this, I thought, what?\n\n1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:22.320\n I've worked with RNA my whole career.\n\n1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:24.280\n It's so fragile.\n\n1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:26.660\n If you look at it the wrong way, it breaks.\n\n1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:29.780\n I mean, that's being facetious, right?\n\n1:44:29.780 --> 1:44:31.600\n But you have to be very careful\n\n1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:34.540\n because your hands are full of enzymes\n\n1:44:34.540 --> 1:44:35.880\n that will degrade RNA.\n\n1:44:37.360 --> 1:44:38.860\n So I thought, how could this possibly work,\n\n1:44:38.860 --> 1:44:40.160\n injecting it into someone's?\n\n1:44:40.160 --> 1:44:43.920\n It's an example of I was skeptical and I was wrong.\n\n1:44:43.920 --> 1:44:47.160\n It turns out that if you modify the RNA properly\n\n1:44:47.160 --> 1:44:50.400\n and protect it in a lipid capsule,\n\n1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:52.920\n it actually works as a vaccine.\n\n1:44:52.920 --> 1:44:54.920\n And people were working on this years\n\n1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:57.060\n before COVID came around.\n\n1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:00.280\n They were doing experimental mRNA vaccines\n\n1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:01.480\n and there were a couple of companies\n\n1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:02.500\n that were working on it.\n\n1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:07.440\n And so at the beginning of 2020, they said, let's try it.\n\n1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:09.680\n And I was skeptical, frankly,\n\n1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:12.120\n because I just thought RNA would be too labile,\n\n1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.600\n but I was wrong.\n\n1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:17.600\n So this is, as we're saying offline, one of the great things\n\n1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:20.600\n about you is you're able to say when you're wrong\n\n1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.320\n about intuitions you've had in the past,\n\n1:45:22.320 --> 1:45:25.140\n which is a beautiful thing for a scientist.\n\n1:45:25.140 --> 1:45:28.120\n But I still think it's very surprising\n\n1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:30.120\n that something like that works, right?\n\n1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:31.400\n Yeah, I am surprised.\n\n1:45:31.400 --> 1:45:36.200\n So you're just launching RNA in a protective membrane.\n\n1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:39.800\n And then now one thing is surprising\n\n1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:44.800\n that the RNA sort of lasts long enough in its structure.\n\n1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:50.440\n But then the other thing is why does it work\n\n1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:55.440\n that that's a good training ground for the immune system?\n\n1:45:56.760 --> 1:45:59.800\n Is that obvious that that should work?\n\n1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:01.260\n I don't think it's obvious to most people\n\n1:46:01.260 --> 1:46:03.040\n and it's worth going into it\n\n1:46:03.040 --> 1:46:04.560\n because it's really interesting.\n\n1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.040\n I mean, first of all, they wrap the RNA in fats,\n\n1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:10.560\n in lipid membranes, right?\n\n1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:14.160\n And the particular formulation they test for years\n\n1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:16.040\n to make sure it's stable,\n\n1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:17.960\n it lasts a long time after it's injected.\n\n1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:22.120\n And the two companies that make the current COVID vaccines,\n\n1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:23.240\n right, Moderna and Pfizer,\n\n1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:26.660\n they have different lipid formulations to get to the same.\n\n1:46:26.660 --> 1:46:29.040\n So that's a real part of it.\n\n1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:30.220\n And it's not simple.\n\n1:46:30.220 --> 1:46:31.880\n There are quite a few different lipids\n\n1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:34.080\n that they put into this coding.\n\n1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:37.040\n And they test to see how long they protect the RNA\n\n1:46:37.040 --> 1:46:39.160\n after it's injected, say, into a mouse,\n\n1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:40.620\n how long does it last?\n\n1:46:40.620 --> 1:46:43.320\n And the way it works is these,\n\n1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:46.160\n apparently these lipid nanoparticles,\n\n1:46:46.160 --> 1:46:48.800\n they get injected into your muscle,\n\n1:46:48.800 --> 1:46:52.120\n they bump into cells and they get taken up.\n\n1:46:52.120 --> 1:46:55.260\n So lipid fat is sticky.\n\n1:46:56.960 --> 1:46:59.880\n It's greasy, we like to say.\n\n1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:03.680\n And so your cells are covered with a greasy membrane also.\n\n1:47:03.680 --> 1:47:06.560\n So when these lipid nanoparticles bump into them,\n\n1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.360\n they stick and they eventually get taken up.\n\n1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:11.240\n And they figured this out right at the beginning.\n\n1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:13.720\n If we put RNA in a lipid nanoparticle,\n\n1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:15.240\n will it get taken up into a cell?\n\n1:47:15.240 --> 1:47:17.960\n And the answer was yes, it was just let's try it.\n\n1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:18.800\n And it worked.\n\n1:47:18.800 --> 1:47:20.340\n So it's basically experiment.\n\n1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:22.640\n It's not like some deep understanding of biology.\n\n1:47:22.640 --> 1:47:25.480\n It's experimentally speaking, it just seems to work.\n\n1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:26.800\n Yeah, well, they had some idea\n\n1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:30.440\n that lipids would target this to a cell membrane.\n\n1:47:30.440 --> 1:47:33.880\n And remember, there's no receptor involved.\n\n1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:36.900\n Like the virus has a specific protein\n\n1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:39.240\n that attaches to a receptor.\n\n1:47:39.240 --> 1:47:41.640\n It's not efficient enough to just bump around\n\n1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:43.240\n and get into a cell.\n\n1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.920\n That's what these things are doing.\n\n1:47:44.920 --> 1:47:47.240\n And they probably optimize the lipids\n\n1:47:47.240 --> 1:47:49.780\n to get more efficient uptake.\n\n1:47:49.780 --> 1:47:51.920\n But it's not as efficient as a virus would be\n\n1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:52.760\n to get into a cell.\n\n1:47:52.760 --> 1:47:54.480\n Right, so you have no specific,\n\n1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:57.600\n I mean, which is why it's surprising\n\n1:47:57.600 --> 1:48:02.600\n that you can crack into the safe with a hammer.\n\n1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:06.080\n Or with some fat.\n\n1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:08.840\n I mean, that's kind of surprising.\n\n1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:11.920\n It's kind of amazing that it works.\n\n1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.920\n But so maybe let's try to talk about this.\n\n1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.160\n So one of the hesitancies around vaccines\n\n1:48:22.560 --> 1:48:24.680\n or basically around any new technology\n\n1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:27.700\n is the fact that mRNA is a new idea.\n\n1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:32.200\n And it's an idea that was shrouded in some skepticism,\n\n1:48:32.200 --> 1:48:35.320\n as you said, by the scientific community.\n\n1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:39.380\n Because it's a cool new technology.\n\n1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:42.560\n Surprising that it works.\n\n1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:44.400\n What's your intuition?\n\n1:48:44.400 --> 1:48:46.400\n I think one nice way to approach this\n\n1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:51.400\n is try to play devil's advocate and say both sides.\n\n1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:56.160\n One side is why your intuition says\n\n1:48:56.160 --> 1:48:59.080\n that it's safe for humans.\n\n1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.520\n And what arguments can you see if you could steal man\n\n1:49:03.520 --> 1:49:06.680\n and argument why it's unsafe for humans.\n\n1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:09.340\n Or not unsafe for humans,\n\n1:49:09.340 --> 1:49:14.340\n but the hesitancy to take an mRNA vaccine is justified.\n\n1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.520\n So many people are afraid because it's new technology\n\n1:49:19.520 --> 1:49:22.280\n and they feel it hasn't been tested.\n\n1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:25.160\n I mean, in theory, what could go wrong?\n\n1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:29.040\n This is the nice thing about mRNA\n\n1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:30.840\n is that it doesn't last forever.\n\n1:49:32.300 --> 1:49:35.020\n As opposed to DNA, which doesn't last forever,\n\n1:49:35.020 --> 1:49:37.160\n but it can last a lot longer.\n\n1:49:38.180 --> 1:49:40.560\n And it could even go into your DNA, right?\n\n1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:44.340\n So mRNA has a shorter lifetime,\n\n1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:47.300\n maybe days after it's injected into your arm,\n\n1:49:47.300 --> 1:49:48.720\n then it's gone.\n\n1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:49.740\n So that's a good thing\n\n1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:52.040\n because it's not gonna be around forever.\n\n1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:56.640\n So that would say, okay, so it's sticking around\n\n1:49:56.640 --> 1:49:58.300\n for your lifetime is not happening.\n\n1:49:58.300 --> 1:50:00.000\n But what else could happen?\n\n1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.100\n Well, let's see the protein that's made,\n\n1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:05.240\n could that be an issue?\n\n1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.980\n And again, proteins don't last forever.\n\n1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:12.500\n They have a finite longevity in the body.\n\n1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:17.440\n And this one also lasts perhaps at the best a few weeks.\n\n1:50:17.440 --> 1:50:18.880\n Now this is a protein that's made\n\n1:50:18.880 --> 1:50:22.060\n after the RNA gets into the cell.\n\n1:50:22.060 --> 1:50:25.060\n Yeah, so the lipid nanoparticles taken up into a cell\n\n1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:27.860\n and the mRNA is translated and you get protein made.\n\n1:50:27.860 --> 1:50:30.280\n And there's also a question, I'm sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:50:30.280 --> 1:50:35.100\n where in the body, so because it's not well targeted,\n\n1:50:35.100 --> 1:50:38.320\n or I don't know if it's supposed to be targeted,\n\n1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:39.920\n but it can go throughout the body,\n\n1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:40.760\n that's one of the concerns.\n\n1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:43.660\n Right, so it's injected deep into your deltoid muscle,\n\n1:50:43.660 --> 1:50:45.140\n right here, shoulder.\n\n1:50:46.100 --> 1:50:49.780\n And the idea is not to put it in a blood vessel,\n\n1:50:49.780 --> 1:50:52.400\n otherwise it would then for sure circulate everywhere.\n\n1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:57.200\n So they go deep in a blood vessel and it's locally injected.\n\n1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:00.380\n And they did, before this even went into people,\n\n1:51:00.380 --> 1:51:01.820\n they did experiments in mice\n\n1:51:01.820 --> 1:51:05.060\n where they gave them a thousand times higher concentrations\n\n1:51:05.060 --> 1:51:06.860\n than they would ever give to people.\n\n1:51:06.860 --> 1:51:09.340\n And then when you do that, it can go everywhere basically.\n\n1:51:09.340 --> 1:51:11.320\n You can find these nanoparticles\n\n1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:14.080\n in every tissue of the mouse.\n\n1:51:14.080 --> 1:51:17.200\n But that's at a thousand fold higher concentration, right?\n\n1:51:17.200 --> 1:51:21.180\n So I think at the levels that we're using in people,\n\n1:51:21.180 --> 1:51:22.520\n most of it's staying in the muscle,\n\n1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:25.620\n but sure, small amounts go elsewhere.\n\n1:51:25.620 --> 1:51:30.460\n Could there be a lot of harm caused if it goes elsewhere?\n\n1:51:30.460 --> 1:51:33.140\n Like let's say ridiculously high quantities.\n\n1:51:33.140 --> 1:51:35.500\n I'm trying to understand what is the damage\n\n1:51:35.500 --> 1:51:39.420\n that could be done from an RNA just floating about.\n\n1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:41.260\n So the RNA itself is not gonna be a problem,\n\n1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:43.940\n it's the protein that is encoded in it, right?\n\n1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:48.820\n This is a viral RNA which has no sequence in us,\n\n1:51:48.820 --> 1:51:50.540\n so there's nothing that it could do.\n\n1:51:50.540 --> 1:51:54.040\n It's the protein that I would say you could ask,\n\n1:51:54.040 --> 1:51:56.160\n what is that gonna do?\n\n1:51:56.160 --> 1:52:00.580\n And the one property we know about the spike\n\n1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:06.740\n is that it can cause fusion of cells, right?\n\n1:52:06.740 --> 1:52:09.280\n That's how the virus gets in in the beginning.\n\n1:52:09.280 --> 1:52:14.280\n The spike attaches to the cell by this H2 receptor\n\n1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:19.180\n and it causes the virus and the cell to fuse.\n\n1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:21.060\n And that's how the RNA gets out of the particle.\n\n1:52:21.060 --> 1:52:24.100\n But so wait, I'm a bit confused.\n\n1:52:24.100 --> 1:52:28.580\n So with this mRNA vaccine with the lipids and the RNA,\n\n1:52:28.580 --> 1:52:30.700\n there's no spike, right?\n\n1:52:30.700 --> 1:52:33.100\n The mRNA codes for the spike.\n\n1:52:33.100 --> 1:52:35.860\n Oh, the mRNA codes, so it creates the spike.\n\n1:52:35.860 --> 1:52:36.700\n Creates a spike.\n\n1:52:36.700 --> 1:52:39.260\n And so that spike could cause fusion of cells.\n\n1:52:39.260 --> 1:52:43.020\n Yes, except they modified the spike so it wouldn't.\n\n1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:45.080\n Got it.\n\n1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:46.420\n They made two amino acid changes in the spike\n\n1:52:46.420 --> 1:52:47.260\n so it would not fuse.\n\n1:52:47.260 --> 1:52:49.540\n So they understand enough which amino acids\n\n1:52:49.540 --> 1:52:51.100\n are responsible for the fusion.\n\n1:52:51.100 --> 1:52:51.940\n That's right.\n\n1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:52.760\n Interesting.\n\n1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:53.600\n This is so cool.\n\n1:52:53.600 --> 1:52:54.440\n So they could modify it.\n\n1:52:54.440 --> 1:52:57.140\n So now it's not gonna cause fusion, so that's not an issue.\n\n1:52:57.140 --> 1:52:59.640\n It's called the prefusion stabilized spike.\n\n1:53:00.980 --> 1:53:01.820\n Cool.\n\n1:53:01.820 --> 1:53:03.180\n So the spike, when it binds ACE2,\n\n1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:07.720\n that top falls off and the part of the spike\n\n1:53:07.720 --> 1:53:09.300\n that causes fusion is now exposed.\n\n1:53:09.300 --> 1:53:11.980\n And that doesn't happen in this mRNA vaccine.\n\n1:53:11.980 --> 1:53:14.900\n So those are the things that could have happened,\n\n1:53:14.900 --> 1:53:18.340\n but I think they're ruled out by what we've just said.\n\n1:53:18.340 --> 1:53:19.700\n But there's no better test\n\n1:53:19.700 --> 1:53:22.300\n than putting it into people, right?\n\n1:53:22.300 --> 1:53:25.060\n And doing phase one, phase two, and phase three,\n\n1:53:25.060 --> 1:53:27.620\n and increasing numbers of people and asking,\n\n1:53:27.620 --> 1:53:28.860\n what do we see?\n\n1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:30.860\n Do we have any concerns?\n\n1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:35.260\n And so now it's been in many millions of people\n\n1:53:35.260 --> 1:53:40.260\n and we don't see most of the effects you see in a vaccine,\n\n1:53:40.820 --> 1:53:43.180\n you see in the first couple of months.\n\n1:53:43.180 --> 1:53:46.060\n Things like the myocarditis with some of the vaccines,\n\n1:53:46.060 --> 1:53:49.300\n the clotting issues with the AstraZeneca vaccine,\n\n1:53:49.300 --> 1:53:53.480\n Guillain Barre, you see those relatively quickly.\n\n1:53:54.860 --> 1:53:58.300\n And we've seen small numbers of those occur,\n\n1:53:58.300 --> 1:54:01.460\n but other things we haven't seen,\n\n1:54:01.460 --> 1:54:04.820\n and you never say never, right?\n\n1:54:04.820 --> 1:54:07.780\n Right, so I mean, this is fascinating, right?\n\n1:54:07.780 --> 1:54:12.780\n It's like I drink, I put Splenda in my coffee\n\n1:54:12.780 --> 1:54:17.780\n and it has supposedly no calories,\n\n1:54:20.460 --> 1:54:22.340\n but it tastes really good.\n\n1:54:22.340 --> 1:54:26.140\n And despite what like rumors and blogs and so on,\n\n1:54:26.140 --> 1:54:28.900\n I have not seen good medical evidence\n\n1:54:28.900 --> 1:54:33.560\n that is harmful to you, but it's like, it tastes too good.\n\n1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:35.420\n So I'm thinking like,\n\n1:54:35.420 --> 1:54:37.740\n there's gotta be longterm consequences,\n\n1:54:37.740 --> 1:54:40.020\n but it's very difficult to understand\n\n1:54:40.020 --> 1:54:43.100\n what the longterm consequences are.\n\n1:54:43.100 --> 1:54:47.660\n And there's this kind of like distant fear\n\n1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:49.540\n or anxiety about it.\n\n1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:53.020\n Like this thing tastes too good, it's too good to be true.\n\n1:54:53.020 --> 1:54:55.700\n There's gotta be, there's no free lunch in this world.\n\n1:54:55.700 --> 1:54:57.820\n This is the kind of feeling that people have\n\n1:54:57.820 --> 1:55:00.320\n about the longterm effects of the vaccine,\n\n1:55:01.660 --> 1:55:04.420\n that you mentioned that there's some intuition\n\n1:55:04.420 --> 1:55:09.000\n about near term effects that you want to remove,\n\n1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.500\n like the diffusion of cells and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:55:11.500 --> 1:55:12.860\n but they think, okay,\n\n1:55:12.860 --> 1:55:14.860\n this travels to other cells in the body,\n\n1:55:14.860 --> 1:55:18.660\n this travels to neurons or that kind of stuff.\n\n1:55:18.660 --> 1:55:20.700\n And then what kind of effect does that have longterm\n\n1:55:20.700 --> 1:55:22.680\n that's yet to be discovered?\n\n1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:25.140\n What do you make me for this vaccine,\n\n1:55:25.140 --> 1:55:28.240\n but in general in science about making statements\n\n1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:32.260\n about longterm negative effects?\n\n1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:34.500\n Is that something that weighs heavy on you?\n\n1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:36.440\n Is that something we can kind of escape\n\n1:55:36.440 --> 1:55:39.020\n through just large scale experimentation\n\n1:55:39.020 --> 1:55:41.300\n with animals and humans?\n\n1:55:41.300 --> 1:55:44.220\n Well, if you're really, if you're concerned about longterm,\n\n1:55:44.220 --> 1:55:46.700\n then you have to do a longterm experiment, right?\n\n1:55:46.700 --> 1:55:50.580\n And maybe you don't see something for 50, 60 years.\n\n1:55:50.580 --> 1:55:53.060\n So if someone says to you,\n\n1:55:53.060 --> 1:55:56.620\n there are no longterm effects of the COVID vaccines,\n\n1:55:56.620 --> 1:55:57.460\n they can't say that\n\n1:55:57.460 --> 1:56:00.280\n because they haven't done the long experiment, right?\n\n1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:02.820\n There's always the possibility, but you have to weigh it.\n\n1:56:02.820 --> 1:56:06.120\n It's always, there's no free lunch, right?\n\n1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:10.300\n There's always a risk benefit calculation you have to make.\n\n1:56:10.300 --> 1:56:14.060\n You can have the study, it goes 50 years and then decide,\n\n1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:18.020\n but I guess what you're doing is just like we said,\n\n1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:22.200\n I forget which one, with polio, with rabies, I forget,\n\n1:56:22.200 --> 1:56:25.460\n but you're weighing the side effects.\n\n1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:26.460\n Yeah, polio, right.\n\n1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:31.100\n The vaccine versus the effects of the virus.\n\n1:56:31.100 --> 1:56:34.540\n And like both of them, you don't know longterm effects,\n\n1:56:34.540 --> 1:56:38.620\n but you're building up intuition as you study,\n\n1:56:38.620 --> 1:56:41.140\n which what are the longterm effects?\n\n1:56:41.140 --> 1:56:46.140\n Like there's a huge number of people,\n\n1:56:46.140 --> 1:56:51.140\n like that have like, I don't want to say experts\n\n1:56:51.460 --> 1:56:52.420\n because I don't like the word,\n\n1:56:52.420 --> 1:56:54.460\n but people have studied it long enough\n\n1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:56.260\n to where they build up intuition.\n\n1:56:56.260 --> 1:56:57.780\n They don't know for sure.\n\n1:56:57.780 --> 1:57:00.580\n There's basic science being done, there's basic studies.\n\n1:57:00.580 --> 1:57:05.580\n But you start to build up an intuition of what might be\n\n1:57:05.880 --> 1:57:08.580\n a problem down the line and what is not,\n\n1:57:08.580 --> 1:57:09.980\n biologically speaking.\n\n1:57:09.980 --> 1:57:14.260\n And so given that map, then considering the virus,\n\n1:57:14.260 --> 1:57:16.800\n there seems to be a lot of evidence for COVID\n\n1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:21.800\n having negative effects on all aspects of the body,\n\n1:57:21.820 --> 1:57:24.860\n not just even respiratory, which is kind of interesting.\n\n1:57:24.860 --> 1:57:27.060\n So the cognitive stuff is terrifying.\n\n1:57:27.060 --> 1:57:28.940\n All kinds of systems evolve, yes.\n\n1:57:28.940 --> 1:57:32.380\n And then you look at the same thing with the vaccine\n\n1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:34.700\n and there seems to be less of that.\n\n1:57:34.700 --> 1:57:36.340\n But of course you don't know\n\n1:57:36.340 --> 1:57:39.260\n if it's some kind of dormant thing that's just going to.\n\n1:57:39.260 --> 1:57:40.380\n You won't know.\n\n1:57:40.380 --> 1:57:42.580\n You have to make a judgment.\n\n1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:44.900\n And for a lot of people they can't, right?\n\n1:57:44.900 --> 1:57:47.580\n Because they don't have the tools to make the judgment.\n\n1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:49.340\n I totally understand that.\n\n1:57:49.340 --> 1:57:54.340\n And we have let people down a few times in medicine, right?\n\n1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:57.820\n And I know two very specific examples.\n\n1:57:57.820 --> 1:58:00.580\n The first polio vaccine ever made,\n\n1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:03.380\n the Salk vaccine was released in 1955.\n\n1:58:04.460 --> 1:58:06.420\n Immediately within months,\n\n1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:09.460\n a few hundred cases of paralysis in kids who got it\n\n1:58:09.460 --> 1:58:12.940\n because it was not properly inactivated.\n\n1:58:14.180 --> 1:58:15.340\n Now you have to understand,\n\n1:58:15.340 --> 1:58:17.820\n parents were dying for a polio vaccine\n\n1:58:17.820 --> 1:58:20.020\n because kids were getting paralyzed every summer,\n\n1:58:20.020 --> 1:58:22.340\n 30,000 kids a year.\n\n1:58:22.340 --> 1:58:24.860\n And so they went and took it.\n\n1:58:24.860 --> 1:58:27.060\n They took the word of the medical establishment\n\n1:58:27.060 --> 1:58:29.580\n that it was safe and it wasn't.\n\n1:58:29.580 --> 1:58:31.980\n Big letdown, never going to forget something.\n\n1:58:31.980 --> 1:58:36.020\n Although I think a lot of people today aren't aware of that.\n\n1:58:36.020 --> 1:58:38.220\n I think that was a big problem that's everlasting.\n\n1:58:38.220 --> 1:58:42.060\n Then the attenuated vaccine that we talked about,\n\n1:58:42.060 --> 1:58:45.900\n the infectious causing polio.\n\n1:58:45.900 --> 1:58:49.940\n Yet parents continued to bring their kids to be vaccinated\n\n1:58:49.940 --> 1:58:50.780\n because they were said,\n\n1:58:50.780 --> 1:58:52.380\n this is the right thing to do.\n\n1:58:52.380 --> 1:58:53.220\n And I have to say,\n\n1:58:53.220 --> 1:58:55.020\n I was involved in several lawsuits\n\n1:58:55.020 --> 1:58:58.420\n where parents of a kid who got paralyzed\n\n1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:01.860\n from the polio vaccine decided to sue the manufacturer\n\n1:59:01.860 --> 1:59:04.620\n and get some money for their kid.\n\n1:59:04.620 --> 1:59:07.020\n And so they got mad.\n\n1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:10.020\n And I think you could not...\n\n1:59:11.620 --> 1:59:14.620\n The first issue could have been prevented,\n\n1:59:15.780 --> 1:59:18.540\n could have been prevented by inactivating it properly.\n\n1:59:18.540 --> 1:59:21.180\n I think the company just did the wrong thing.\n\n1:59:21.180 --> 1:59:23.220\n The second we had evidence for,\n\n1:59:23.220 --> 1:59:25.900\n and we should probably have not used that vaccine any longer,\n\n1:59:25.900 --> 1:59:28.180\n but I think that destroys public confidence.\n\n1:59:28.180 --> 1:59:29.220\n But those aren't...\n\n1:59:29.220 --> 1:59:30.060\n They're not long term.\n\n1:59:30.060 --> 1:59:30.900\n That's a minority of cases.\n\n1:59:30.900 --> 1:59:31.740\n This is a minority.\n\n1:59:31.740 --> 1:59:32.580\n This is a very rare event, yeah.\n\n1:59:32.580 --> 1:59:33.420\n But nevertheless,\n\n1:59:33.420 --> 1:59:38.420\n science as an institution didn't make corrections\n\n1:59:38.700 --> 1:59:39.540\n in that case.\n\n1:59:39.540 --> 1:59:40.380\n No, they didn't.\n\n1:59:40.380 --> 1:59:44.580\n And so what do you make of that?\n\n1:59:44.580 --> 1:59:45.980\n I mean, it's very unfortunate\n\n1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:49.460\n that those few things can destroy trust.\n\n1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.140\n But I don't think that lasts till today.\n\n1:59:51.140 --> 1:59:53.660\n I think today is a different era, right?\n\n1:59:53.660 --> 1:59:55.340\n And most people don't know about those stories.\n\n1:59:55.340 --> 1:59:58.900\n I tell them to you because that's what could happen.\n\n1:59:58.900 --> 2:00:01.340\n I think it could happen today.\n\n2:00:01.340 --> 2:00:05.620\n If you look at the history of the polio vaccine,\n\n2:00:06.620 --> 2:00:10.820\n the US Public Health Service wanted kids to be vaccinated.\n\n2:00:10.820 --> 2:00:13.500\n So they did things that probably weren't correct\n\n2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:15.740\n to get the vaccine back online.\n\n2:00:15.740 --> 2:00:16.580\n Right?\n\n2:00:16.580 --> 2:00:19.020\n But they did it and they pushed it through.\n\n2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:23.660\n So the question is, what do we do today?\n\n2:00:23.660 --> 2:00:27.300\n So I can look at, as we just said,\n\n2:00:27.300 --> 2:00:29.100\n I can look at what might happen\n\n2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:33.300\n and I can make reasonable decisions\n\n2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:35.060\n about the likelihood of them happening.\n\n2:00:35.060 --> 2:00:38.940\n And I can also say, I don't wanna get COVID of any kind\n\n2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:41.700\n because I've seen how nasty it can be.\n\n2:00:41.700 --> 2:00:44.020\n And I decide I'm taking the risk,\n\n2:00:44.020 --> 2:00:46.060\n whatever small of a long term effect,\n\n2:00:46.060 --> 2:00:47.020\n I'm gonna take the risk.\n\n2:00:47.020 --> 2:00:49.980\n My family took the risk and many other people did.\n\n2:00:49.980 --> 2:00:50.900\n Of a vaccine.\n\n2:00:50.900 --> 2:00:52.460\n Of getting vaccinated.\n\n2:00:52.460 --> 2:00:53.980\n Because I think it's very small.\n\n2:00:53.980 --> 2:00:56.900\n But I understand where people can't make that decision.\n\n2:00:56.900 --> 2:00:58.380\n And that begs the question,\n\n2:00:58.380 --> 2:01:01.260\n what would they need to make a decision?\n\n2:01:01.260 --> 2:01:05.420\n So if you're concerned about an effect in 40 years,\n\n2:01:06.820 --> 2:01:09.180\n we're not gonna know for 40 years.\n\n2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:11.020\n Yeah, so I think if I were to speak,\n\n2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:14.820\n because I talked to, like I mentioned offline to Joe Rogan\n\n2:01:14.820 --> 2:01:15.980\n and his podcast yesterday,\n\n2:01:15.980 --> 2:01:18.780\n I talked to him all the time about this.\n\n2:01:18.780 --> 2:01:23.780\n I think the concern is less about the long term effects\n\n2:01:27.260 --> 2:01:28.460\n like on paper.\n\n2:01:28.460 --> 2:01:33.460\n It's more about the, like people like Anthony Fauci\n\n2:01:34.540 --> 2:01:39.140\n and people at the top are simply misrepresenting the data\n\n2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:42.980\n or like are not accurately being transparent.\n\n2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:45.020\n Not collecting the data properly.\n\n2:01:45.020 --> 2:01:46.820\n Not reporting on the data properly.\n\n2:01:46.820 --> 2:01:48.300\n Not being transparent.\n\n2:01:48.300 --> 2:01:50.380\n Not representing the uncertainties.\n\n2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:55.380\n Not openly saying they were wrong two months ago.\n\n2:01:55.780 --> 2:01:58.100\n Like in a way that's not like dramatic,\n\n2:01:58.100 --> 2:02:00.980\n but revealing the basic process of science\n\n2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:03.740\n when you have to do your best under uncertainty.\n\n2:02:03.740 --> 2:02:06.060\n Just also just being inauthentic.\n\n2:02:06.060 --> 2:02:09.500\n There's a sense, especially with like a younger generation\n\n2:02:09.500 --> 2:02:11.700\n now, there's a certain way on the internet.\n\n2:02:11.700 --> 2:02:14.260\n Like the internet can smell bullshit\n\n2:02:14.260 --> 2:02:16.900\n much better than previous generations could.\n\n2:02:16.900 --> 2:02:21.740\n And so they see there's a kind of inauthenticity\n\n2:02:21.740 --> 2:02:26.420\n that comes with being like representing authority.\n\n2:02:26.420 --> 2:02:27.980\n Like I am a scientist.\n\n2:02:27.980 --> 2:02:29.020\n I'm an expert.\n\n2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:30.460\n I have a PhD.\n\n2:02:30.460 --> 2:02:31.900\n I have four decades of work.\n\n2:02:31.900 --> 2:02:34.020\n Therefore everyone should listen to me.\n\n2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:38.940\n And somehow that maps to this feeling of,\n\n2:02:38.940 --> 2:02:40.740\n well, what are they hiding?\n\n2:02:40.740 --> 2:02:43.100\n If they're speaking from authority like this,\n\n2:02:43.100 --> 2:02:45.740\n if everyone is in agreement like this,\n\n2:02:45.740 --> 2:02:48.180\n that means they all have emails between each other.\n\n2:02:48.180 --> 2:02:49.500\n They said, we're gonna tell this.\n\n2:02:49.500 --> 2:02:51.860\n This is the message we're gonna tell the public.\n\n2:02:51.860 --> 2:02:54.860\n Then what is the truth, the actual truth?\n\n2:02:54.860 --> 2:02:57.220\n Maybe there's a much bigger uncertainty.\n\n2:02:57.220 --> 2:02:59.980\n Maybe there's dead people in the basement\n\n2:02:59.980 --> 2:03:03.860\n that they're hiding from bad mRNA vaccine experiments.\n\n2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:06.660\n Maybe they're, and then the conspiracy theory\n\n2:03:06.660 --> 2:03:09.140\n starts to grow naturally\n\n2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:11.860\n when there's this kind of mistrust of that.\n\n2:03:11.860 --> 2:03:16.860\n So it's less about kind of like a deep concern\n\n2:03:17.180 --> 2:03:18.980\n about longterm effects.\n\n2:03:18.980 --> 2:03:22.540\n It's a concern about longterm effects\n\n2:03:24.660 --> 2:03:27.100\n if we find out that there's some secret stuff\n\n2:03:27.100 --> 2:03:28.420\n that we're not being told.\n\n2:03:28.420 --> 2:03:30.060\n It all lands on that.\n\n2:03:30.060 --> 2:03:32.380\n So what the heck, I mean, so I put the blame\n\n2:03:32.380 --> 2:03:35.580\n not on the data, but basically on the leaders\n\n2:03:35.580 --> 2:03:39.260\n and the communicators of the science at the top.\n\n2:03:39.260 --> 2:03:43.780\n Well, to that I would say all the data,\n\n2:03:43.780 --> 2:03:46.020\n as far as I know, are made public.\n\n2:03:47.060 --> 2:03:48.780\n So you can dive into it.\n\n2:03:48.780 --> 2:03:51.540\n And I know a lot of people ask me questions\n\n2:03:51.540 --> 2:03:54.180\n and I just say, it's right here in the data.\n\n2:03:54.180 --> 2:03:55.820\n And I know a lot of people can't do that.\n\n2:03:55.820 --> 2:03:57.460\n They can't dive into it.\n\n2:03:57.460 --> 2:04:00.340\n But that's one solution for people who are able.\n\n2:04:00.340 --> 2:04:01.860\n Now you could argue, well,\n\n2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:03.460\n maybe they've left data out.\n\n2:04:03.460 --> 2:04:05.460\n Well, then not even I can help\n\n2:04:05.460 --> 2:04:07.180\n because then they're hiding it from me too.\n\n2:04:07.180 --> 2:04:08.580\n And I think that's highly unlikely.\n\n2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:09.940\n I think for the most part,\n\n2:04:09.940 --> 2:04:11.860\n the FDA requires the release\n\n2:04:11.860 --> 2:04:14.260\n of all the clinical trial data, right?\n\n2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:17.600\n So, okay, so this clinical trial data, that's one thing.\n\n2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:20.180\n So that's the data that we should be focusing on, right?\n\n2:04:20.180 --> 2:04:24.180\n So there's a lot of different data sets here.\n\n2:04:24.180 --> 2:04:25.700\n So there's preclinical data,\n\n2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.260\n which is everything that was done in the lab\n\n2:04:28.260 --> 2:04:30.900\n before this vaccine ever went into a human arm.\n\n2:04:30.900 --> 2:04:32.260\n It's all the cell culture work\n\n2:04:32.260 --> 2:04:35.900\n that we talked about a little, experiments in animals.\n\n2:04:35.900 --> 2:04:38.380\n All of that is publicly accessible.\n\n2:04:38.380 --> 2:04:39.980\n Most of it gets published.\n\n2:04:39.980 --> 2:04:42.580\n And then there's the initial drug filing,\n\n2:04:42.580 --> 2:04:45.060\n which is huge, the books of,\n\n2:04:45.060 --> 2:04:46.980\n you can get that and look at it, right?\n\n2:04:46.980 --> 2:04:49.820\n This is me sort of asking sort of difficult questions here.\n\n2:04:49.820 --> 2:04:50.660\n It's okay.\n\n2:04:51.980 --> 2:04:56.060\n So there's a lot of money to be made by makers of the vaccine.\n\n2:04:56.060 --> 2:05:00.940\n So for these companies, and obviously there's a distrust\n\n2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.460\n of those folks too.\n\n2:05:02.460 --> 2:05:04.540\n They've done a lot of really good things in this world,\n\n2:05:04.540 --> 2:05:07.380\n but the incentives are such\n\n2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:09.940\n that you wanna sweep stuff under the rug\n\n2:05:09.940 --> 2:05:14.940\n if you're not 100% pure in your ethics.\n\n2:05:15.420 --> 2:05:20.420\n And how hard is it for that data to be fabricated,\n\n2:05:21.140 --> 2:05:24.540\n manipulated, like what's your intuition\n\n2:05:24.540 --> 2:05:26.100\n for the pre trial stuff?\n\n2:05:26.100 --> 2:05:29.020\n I think when you start fabricating,\n\n2:05:29.020 --> 2:05:31.380\n then you get inconsistencies,\n\n2:05:31.380 --> 2:05:34.380\n which are pretty easy to pick up.\n\n2:05:34.380 --> 2:05:36.700\n When you're talking about some large scale things\n\n2:05:36.700 --> 2:05:38.020\n of this nature.\n\n2:05:38.020 --> 2:05:40.940\n Because then you can look through the data very,\n\n2:05:40.940 --> 2:05:43.660\n you're gonna, I mean, we require looking very carefully,\n\n2:05:43.660 --> 2:05:46.860\n but you will see inconsistencies from one trial to another.\n\n2:05:46.860 --> 2:05:50.740\n And that might ring a bell that something's been done.\n\n2:05:50.740 --> 2:05:55.180\n Yeah, it's like the moon landing thing.\n\n2:05:55.180 --> 2:05:58.380\n Sometimes like going to the moon is easier than faking it.\n\n2:05:58.380 --> 2:06:00.100\n Right.\n\n2:06:00.100 --> 2:06:03.380\n In the sense it might be easier to do a large scale trial\n\n2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:05.940\n and get an effective vaccine versus faking it.\n\n2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:08.340\n But when you brought up the for profit issue,\n\n2:06:08.340 --> 2:06:11.460\n I think that is always been an issue.\n\n2:06:11.460 --> 2:06:15.780\n I've always felt that having your health depend\n\n2:06:15.780 --> 2:06:20.780\n on for profit industry may not be the best solution.\n\n2:06:20.820 --> 2:06:23.180\n And I don't know how else to do it.\n\n2:06:23.180 --> 2:06:26.540\n People tell me I'm a dreamer that thinking that,\n\n2:06:26.540 --> 2:06:28.300\n all medicines could be nonprofit.\n\n2:06:28.300 --> 2:06:30.980\n But I also think that the world should have one health\n\n2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:32.780\n system that takes care of everyone, right?\n\n2:06:32.780 --> 2:06:34.700\n Because there's some countries that can't\n\n2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:37.580\n and other countries have an excess like us.\n\n2:06:37.580 --> 2:06:40.220\n So I wish we could do that.\n\n2:06:40.220 --> 2:06:44.140\n Well, the argument is the speed of which the vaccines\n\n2:06:44.140 --> 2:06:47.420\n for COVID were produced would never happen\n\n2:06:47.420 --> 2:06:49.180\n in a nonprofit system,\n\n2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:51.700\n would never happen in a non capitalist system.\n\n2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:56.060\n Oh, I could set up a vaccine production institute\n\n2:06:56.060 --> 2:06:58.860\n in the US that would get the vaccines done\n\n2:06:58.860 --> 2:07:00.860\n because you just need to put money into it.\n\n2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:03.540\n That's what made these vaccines get done money.\n\n2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:06.900\n They poured billions of dollars and they got it done quickly.\n\n2:07:06.900 --> 2:07:09.700\n But if I set up a nonprofit institutes of vaccines\n\n2:07:09.700 --> 2:07:12.500\n throughout the US staffed with really talented people,\n\n2:07:12.500 --> 2:07:15.020\n pay them well, keep them motivated,\n\n2:07:15.020 --> 2:07:15.860\n you'll get your vaccine.\n\n2:07:15.860 --> 2:07:19.940\n No, but that's the thing with capitalism is that\n\n2:07:19.940 --> 2:07:22.820\n the selection of who to hire a good,\n\n2:07:22.820 --> 2:07:24.940\n when you say good people,\n\n2:07:24.940 --> 2:07:28.140\n capitalism has a machine that fires people\n\n2:07:28.140 --> 2:07:30.900\n who are not good and selects people that are good.\n\n2:07:30.900 --> 2:07:32.660\n Coming from the Soviet Union,\n\n2:07:32.660 --> 2:07:35.020\n the dream of communism is similar\n\n2:07:35.020 --> 2:07:37.340\n to what you're saying broadly defined.\n\n2:07:37.340 --> 2:07:40.020\n It certainly doesn't work in the broads.\n\n2:07:40.020 --> 2:07:44.860\n The question of whether it works in the healthcare space,\n\n2:07:45.820 --> 2:07:49.500\n there is some aspect to the machine of capitalism\n\n2:07:49.500 --> 2:07:53.020\n being the most effective way to select for good people\n\n2:07:53.020 --> 2:07:55.220\n and to effectively produce the thing.\n\n2:07:56.100 --> 2:07:58.500\n But then of course, a lot of people would argue\n\n2:07:58.500 --> 2:08:01.140\n the current, even the current healthcare is not\n\n2:08:01.140 --> 2:08:03.620\n with like regulations, there's some weird mix\n\n2:08:03.620 --> 2:08:07.060\n where there's a lot of opportunities for inefficiencies.\n\n2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:09.020\n There's a lot of opportunities for bureaucracy.\n\n2:08:09.020 --> 2:08:11.820\n So you have like the worst of all worlds.\n\n2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:13.980\n Can't there be some intermediate that works\n\n2:08:13.980 --> 2:08:17.260\n because I mean, the other issue that we haven't mentioned\n\n2:08:17.260 --> 2:08:19.220\n is that politics gets thrown into this\n\n2:08:19.220 --> 2:08:21.380\n and that really messes up\n\n2:08:21.380 --> 2:08:22.980\n and it should never be mixed with healthcare,\n\n2:08:22.980 --> 2:08:26.820\n but it is because a lot of funding comes from the government\n\n2:08:26.820 --> 2:08:29.300\n so that's another confounding factor.\n\n2:08:29.300 --> 2:08:33.660\n But I really think I could make a vaccine institute\n\n2:08:33.660 --> 2:08:36.620\n that if someone didn't do well, I'd fire them.\n\n2:08:36.620 --> 2:08:39.100\n No, you're not gonna stay if you can't do your job\n\n2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:41.380\n and do it well, you don't give them incentives,\n\n2:08:41.380 --> 2:08:44.700\n but it doesn't have to be the two extremes I think.\n\n2:08:44.700 --> 2:08:47.740\n There has to be a solution that people don't have\n\n2:08:47.740 --> 2:08:51.580\n this mistrust for a company making huge profits\n\n2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:52.460\n off of a drug.\n\n2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:54.100\n But you know what, it's funny,\n\n2:08:55.340 --> 2:08:58.300\n it seems that vaccines and antivirals bear the brunt\n\n2:08:58.300 --> 2:09:01.380\n of this criticism yet there are many other pharmaceuticals\n\n2:09:01.380 --> 2:09:04.380\n that people rely on of all sorts.\n\n2:09:04.380 --> 2:09:06.400\n They don't seem to question and have issues\n\n2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:09.180\n with those and they have far more side effects than vaccines.\n\n2:09:09.180 --> 2:09:11.900\n It's a very strange how we're picking that way,\n\n2:09:11.900 --> 2:09:16.900\n but I should also say that if you have one big\n\n2:09:17.420 --> 2:09:22.220\n vaccine institute, one of the other sets\n\n2:09:22.220 --> 2:09:27.220\n of vaccine conspiracies, I mean, I would say they're\n\n2:09:28.420 --> 2:09:32.460\n a little farther out into the wild side of ideas,\n\n2:09:32.460 --> 2:09:37.220\n but there's one way to control the populace\n\n2:09:37.220 --> 2:09:41.140\n is by injecting substances into them, right?\n\n2:09:41.140 --> 2:09:44.860\n People, I mean, part of that, funny enough,\n\n2:09:44.860 --> 2:09:46.180\n it probably has to do with needles\n\n2:09:46.180 --> 2:09:48.940\n versus something you put in your mouth,\n\n2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:50.820\n but there's something about the government,\n\n2:09:50.820 --> 2:09:53.580\n especially when it's government mandated injection\n\n2:09:53.580 --> 2:09:54.960\n of a substance into you.\n\n2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:57.780\n I don't care what the science says,\n\n2:09:57.780 --> 2:10:00.940\n if it's 100% effective, 100% safe,\n\n2:10:00.940 --> 2:10:03.980\n there's a natural distrust of what,\n\n2:10:03.980 --> 2:10:07.680\n like even if this is effective and safe,\n\n2:10:08.660 --> 2:10:11.980\n giving the government power to do this,\n\n2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:15.080\n aren't they gonna start getting ideas down the line for,\n\n2:10:15.080 --> 2:10:15.920\n you know.\n\n2:10:17.920 --> 2:10:20.760\n I think that they can barely govern.\n\n2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:22.220\n I don't think they're gonna do that,\n\n2:10:22.220 --> 2:10:25.980\n but you don't have to take, unless you're a federal employee,\n\n2:10:25.980 --> 2:10:27.900\n you don't have to take a COVID vaccine.\n\n2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:32.900\n Yeah, but that largely has to do, not largely,\n\n2:10:32.980 --> 2:10:36.540\n but there is an individualistic spirit\n\n2:10:39.740 --> 2:10:41.420\n to the American people.\n\n2:10:41.420 --> 2:10:44.400\n There's this, like, you're not gonna take my gun away\n\n2:10:44.400 --> 2:10:47.300\n from me, you're not going, and I think that,\n\n2:10:52.420 --> 2:10:56.060\n that's something that makes America what it is.\n\n2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:57.500\n Just coming from the Soviet Union,\n\n2:10:57.500 --> 2:10:59.940\n there's a power to sort of resisting\n\n2:10:59.940 --> 2:11:01.720\n the overreach of government.\n\n2:11:01.720 --> 2:11:04.440\n That's quite interesting, because I'm a believer,\n\n2:11:04.440 --> 2:11:08.020\n I hope that it's possible to have,\n\n2:11:08.020 --> 2:11:11.600\n to strive towards a government that works extremely well.\n\n2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:14.860\n I think at its best, a government represents the people\n\n2:11:14.860 --> 2:11:17.880\n and functions in the similar way that you're mentioning,\n\n2:11:17.880 --> 2:11:20.140\n but that, like, pushback,\n\n2:11:20.140 --> 2:11:22.580\n even if it turns into conspiracy theory sometimes,\n\n2:11:22.580 --> 2:11:25.980\n I think is actually healthy in the long arc of history.\n\n2:11:25.980 --> 2:11:28.100\n It can be frustrating sometimes,\n\n2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:30.900\n but that mechanism of pushing back against power,\n\n2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:32.980\n against authority, can be healthy.\n\n2:11:32.980 --> 2:11:36.500\n I agree, I think it's fine to question the vaccines.\n\n2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:39.060\n What I have issue with is that many people\n\n2:11:40.140 --> 2:11:43.180\n put out incorrect information,\n\n2:11:43.180 --> 2:11:45.380\n and I'm not sure what their motivations are,\n\n2:11:45.380 --> 2:11:47.020\n and it's very hard to fight that,\n\n2:11:47.020 --> 2:11:50.100\n because then it's my word versus theirs,\n\n2:11:50.100 --> 2:11:52.340\n and I'm happy to talk with people\n\n2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:54.300\n about any of their concerns,\n\n2:11:54.300 --> 2:11:56.700\n but if you start getting into the stuff\n\n2:11:56.700 --> 2:11:59.260\n that just isn't true, then we have a problem.\n\n2:11:59.260 --> 2:12:03.340\n The thing I struggle with is conspiracy theories,\n\n2:12:03.340 --> 2:12:04.660\n whatever language you want to use,\n\n2:12:04.660 --> 2:12:09.360\n but sort of ideas that challenge\n\n2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:12.100\n the mainstream quote unquote narrative,\n\n2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:16.180\n given our current social media and internet,\n\n2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:17.820\n like the way it operates,\n\n2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:20.340\n they can become viral much easier.\n\n2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:22.700\n There's something much more compelling about them.\n\n2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:27.700\n Like I have a secret about the way things really work.\n\n2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:30.200\n That becomes viral, and that's very frustrating,\n\n2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:31.740\n because then you're not having\n\n2:12:31.740 --> 2:12:33.420\n a conversation on level ground.\n\n2:12:36.140 --> 2:12:38.280\n When you're trying to present scientific ideas,\n\n2:12:38.280 --> 2:12:39.820\n and then there's conspiracy theories,\n\n2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:42.780\n the conspiracy theories become viral much faster,\n\n2:12:42.780 --> 2:12:44.820\n and then you're not just having a discussion\n\n2:12:44.820 --> 2:12:45.840\n on level ground.\n\n2:12:47.980 --> 2:12:49.180\n That's the frustrating part,\n\n2:12:49.180 --> 2:12:51.880\n that it's not an even discussion.\n\n2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:53.580\n Can I just say one more thing?\n\n2:12:53.580 --> 2:12:54.860\n I mean, the internet is here to stay,\n\n2:12:54.860 --> 2:12:56.140\n so we're gonna have to figure out\n\n2:12:56.140 --> 2:12:57.300\n how to deal with it, right?\n\n2:12:57.300 --> 2:12:59.340\n But from my perspective,\n\n2:12:59.340 --> 2:13:03.020\n I was skeptical that any COVID vaccine\n\n2:13:03.020 --> 2:13:05.860\n would be ready within a year.\n\n2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:07.020\n That's amazing.\n\n2:13:07.020 --> 2:13:12.020\n Plus, the way I look at the mRNA vaccine as a scientist,\n\n2:13:12.340 --> 2:13:13.900\n it's gee whiz to me.\n\n2:13:13.900 --> 2:13:15.560\n It's amazing that it worked,\n\n2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.660\n and I think the data are great, so I want it.\n\n2:13:19.980 --> 2:13:21.260\n As a scientist, I want it.\n\n2:13:21.260 --> 2:13:23.140\n One of the really sad things, again,\n\n2:13:23.140 --> 2:13:27.040\n with me, too, as a scientist or as an admirer of science,\n\n2:13:29.780 --> 2:13:31.260\n I don't know if it's politics,\n\n2:13:31.260 --> 2:13:34.940\n but one of the sad things to me about the previous year\n\n2:13:34.940 --> 2:13:38.440\n is that I wasn't free to celebrate\n\n2:13:38.440 --> 2:13:42.380\n the incredible accomplishment of science with the vaccines.\n\n2:13:42.380 --> 2:13:44.140\n I was very skeptical that it's possible\n\n2:13:44.140 --> 2:13:47.660\n to develop a vaccine so quickly.\n\n2:13:47.660 --> 2:13:50.740\n So it's unfortunate that we can't celebrate\n\n2:13:50.740 --> 2:13:54.100\n how amazing humans are to come up with this vaccine.\n\n2:13:54.100 --> 2:13:57.300\n Now, this vaccine might have long term effects.\n\n2:13:57.300 --> 2:14:00.180\n That doesn't mean this is not incredible.\n\n2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:04.300\n Why couldn't you celebrate?\n\n2:14:06.580 --> 2:14:08.620\n Because I would love to inspire the world\n\n2:14:08.620 --> 2:14:11.340\n with the amazing things science can do.\n\n2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:14.000\n And when you say something about the vaccines,\n\n2:14:14.000 --> 2:14:15.660\n they're not listening to the science.\n\n2:14:15.660 --> 2:14:17.440\n A lot of people are not listening to the science.\n\n2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:22.440\n What they hear is, oh, you're a Republican\n\n2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:25.220\n or you're a Democrat, and you're social signaling,\n\n2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:26.700\n doing some kind of signaling.\n\n2:14:26.700 --> 2:14:27.820\n No, I think that the vaccine,\n\n2:14:27.820 --> 2:14:30.640\n you're talking about injecting something into you,\n\n2:14:30.640 --> 2:14:33.740\n and maybe you're right that the rhetoric is like,\n\n2:14:33.740 --> 2:14:36.140\n you better take this or you're dumb.\n\n2:14:37.140 --> 2:14:38.460\n It's not the right approach.\n\n2:14:38.460 --> 2:14:40.220\n I've seen, actually, it's kind of interesting.\n\n2:14:40.220 --> 2:14:42.940\n I've seen both sides kind of imply that.\n\n2:14:42.940 --> 2:14:47.780\n So the people who are against the vaccine\n\n2:14:48.940 --> 2:14:52.260\n are dumb for not trusting science,\n\n2:14:52.260 --> 2:14:55.680\n and the people who are for the vaccine\n\n2:14:55.680 --> 2:14:59.380\n are called dumb for trusting science,\n\n2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:00.220\n the scientific institution.\n\n2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:01.820\n And nobody wins, yeah.\n\n2:15:01.820 --> 2:15:03.960\n And they both kind of have a point.\n\n2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:07.740\n Like, because you can always,\n\n2:15:07.740 --> 2:15:10.260\n it's like, is the glass half full or half empty?\n\n2:15:10.260 --> 2:15:15.260\n Because you can always look at, like, science\n\n2:15:15.420 --> 2:15:18.160\n from a perspective of certain individuals\n\n2:15:18.160 --> 2:15:22.740\n that don't represent, perhaps, the not greatest leaders,\n\n2:15:23.580 --> 2:15:25.380\n almost like political leaders.\n\n2:15:25.380 --> 2:15:27.620\n There's a lot of, you know,\n\n2:15:27.620 --> 2:15:31.380\n yesterday I went on a whole rant against,\n\n2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:34.140\n I said a lot of positive things about Anthony Fauci\n\n2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:36.140\n before I went on a rant against him.\n\n2:15:36.140 --> 2:15:40.020\n Because ultimately, you know,\n\n2:15:40.020 --> 2:15:41.980\n I think he failed as a leader,\n\n2:15:41.980 --> 2:15:44.260\n and I know it's very difficult to be a leader,\n\n2:15:44.260 --> 2:15:47.340\n but I still wanted to hold him accountable for that\n\n2:15:47.340 --> 2:15:50.700\n as a great communicator of science and as a great leader.\n\n2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:52.300\n What do you think he didn't do right?\n\n2:15:52.300 --> 2:15:53.140\n I'm curious.\n\n2:15:55.060 --> 2:16:00.060\n So the core of the problem is the several characteristics\n\n2:16:00.060 --> 2:16:05.060\n of the way he was communicating to the public.\n\n2:16:06.540 --> 2:16:09.140\n So one is the general inauthenticity.\n\n2:16:10.340 --> 2:16:14.500\n Two is a thing that, it's very hard to put into words,\n\n2:16:14.500 --> 2:16:18.700\n but there's certain ways of speaking to people\n\n2:16:18.700 --> 2:16:21.740\n that sounds like you're hiding something from them.\n\n2:16:21.740 --> 2:16:23.980\n That sounds like you're full of shit.\n\n2:16:23.980 --> 2:16:25.500\n That's the authenticity piece.\n\n2:16:25.500 --> 2:16:30.500\n Like, it sounds like you're not really speaking\n\n2:16:30.620 --> 2:16:34.460\n to the full truth of what you know\n\n2:16:34.460 --> 2:16:38.420\n and that you did some shady shit in your past\n\n2:16:38.420 --> 2:16:40.860\n that you're trying to hide.\n\n2:16:40.860 --> 2:16:42.820\n So that's a way of communicating\n\n2:16:42.820 --> 2:16:45.020\n that I think the internet and people in general\n\n2:16:45.020 --> 2:16:46.780\n are becoming much better at detecting.\n\n2:16:46.780 --> 2:16:48.620\n Yeah, it's like you said, they're good BS detectors.\n\n2:16:48.620 --> 2:16:50.260\n Yeah, good BS detectors.\n\n2:16:51.500 --> 2:16:55.380\n But contributing to that is speaking from authority,\n\n2:16:55.380 --> 2:17:00.380\n speaking with authority and confidence\n\n2:17:01.540 --> 2:17:04.500\n where neither is deserved.\n\n2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:09.500\n So first of all, nobody's an authority on this new virus.\n\n2:17:10.140 --> 2:17:12.220\n We're facing a deadly pandemic,\n\n2:17:12.220 --> 2:17:15.260\n and especially in the early stages,\n\n2:17:15.260 --> 2:17:17.540\n it was unclear how deadly it would be.\n\n2:17:17.540 --> 2:17:19.660\n It was unclear, probably still unclear,\n\n2:17:19.660 --> 2:17:22.140\n fully how it's transmitted.\n\n2:17:22.140 --> 2:17:24.420\n The full dynamics of the virus,\n\n2:17:24.420 --> 2:17:28.540\n the full understanding of which solutions work and not,\n\n2:17:28.540 --> 2:17:31.220\n how well masks of different kinds work,\n\n2:17:31.220 --> 2:17:34.260\n how easy or difficult it is to create tests,\n\n2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:36.500\n how many months or years it's gonna take\n\n2:17:36.500 --> 2:17:37.740\n to create a vaccine,\n\n2:17:38.780 --> 2:17:43.140\n how well in history or currently do quarantine methods\n\n2:17:43.140 --> 2:17:44.660\n or lockdown methods work,\n\n2:17:45.620 --> 2:17:48.060\n what are the different data mechanisms\n\n2:17:48.060 --> 2:17:50.740\n that are data collection mechanisms\n\n2:17:50.740 --> 2:17:52.060\n that are being implemented,\n\n2:17:52.060 --> 2:17:55.660\n what are the clear plans that need to happen,\n\n2:17:55.660 --> 2:17:58.340\n what the epidemiology that's happening,\n\n2:17:58.340 --> 2:18:00.140\n what is the uncertainty around that?\n\n2:18:02.340 --> 2:18:05.620\n Then there's the geopolitical stuff with China.\n\n2:18:09.140 --> 2:18:11.460\n I personally believe there should have been\n\n2:18:11.460 --> 2:18:15.300\n much more openness about the origins of the virus,\n\n2:18:15.300 --> 2:18:17.100\n whether they're leaked from a lab or not.\n\n2:18:17.100 --> 2:18:21.180\n I think communicating that you're open to these ideas\n\n2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:25.340\n is actually the way to get people to trust you,\n\n2:18:25.340 --> 2:18:28.220\n that you are legitimately open to ideas\n\n2:18:28.220 --> 2:18:31.260\n that are very unpleasant, that go against the mainstream.\n\n2:18:32.540 --> 2:18:35.740\n Showing that openness is going to get people to trust you\n\n2:18:35.740 --> 2:18:40.740\n when you finally decrease the variance in your uncertainty,\n\n2:18:40.980 --> 2:18:42.820\n like decrease uncertainty and have,\n\n2:18:42.820 --> 2:18:44.420\n we still have a lot of uncertainty,\n\n2:18:44.420 --> 2:18:46.460\n but this is the best course of action.\n\n2:18:46.460 --> 2:18:49.660\n Vaccines still have a lot of uncertainty around them.\n\n2:18:49.660 --> 2:18:51.260\n mRNA is a new technology,\n\n2:18:51.260 --> 2:18:53.300\n but we have increasing amounts of data,\n\n2:18:53.300 --> 2:18:54.940\n and here's the data sources,\n\n2:18:54.940 --> 2:18:58.740\n and laying them out in a very clear way\n\n2:18:58.740 --> 2:19:01.260\n of this is the best course of action that we have now.\n\n2:19:01.260 --> 2:19:04.060\n We don't know if it's the perfect course of action,\n\n2:19:04.060 --> 2:19:06.420\n but it's by far the best course of action.\n\n2:19:06.420 --> 2:19:09.460\n And that would come from a leader\n\n2:19:09.460 --> 2:19:13.060\n that has earned the capital of trust from people.\n\n2:19:13.060 --> 2:19:15.900\n I mean, I think in recent history,\n\n2:19:15.900 --> 2:19:19.740\n the worst pandemic is 1918 flu, right?\n\n2:19:19.740 --> 2:19:22.540\n But that's mainly because we didn't know what to do.\n\n2:19:22.540 --> 2:19:24.420\n We didn't have many tools at our disposal.\n\n2:19:24.420 --> 2:19:26.420\n And that was tied up with World War I.\n\n2:19:26.420 --> 2:19:27.900\n That's right, that's right.\n\n2:19:27.900 --> 2:19:30.300\n So the leadership there, I mean.\n\n2:19:30.300 --> 2:19:32.820\n But I don't know what is a lot of deaths, right?\n\n2:19:32.820 --> 2:19:35.420\n And any one person is someone's family,\n\n2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:37.420\n so to them it's a lot, right?\n\n2:19:37.420 --> 2:19:41.740\n But that logic, we don't apply that logic generally,\n\n2:19:41.740 --> 2:19:43.420\n because there's a lot of people suffering\n\n2:19:43.420 --> 2:19:44.860\n and dying throughout the world,\n\n2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:47.780\n and we turn the other way all the time.\n\n2:19:47.780 --> 2:19:49.100\n And that's the story of history.\n\n2:19:49.100 --> 2:19:51.580\n So saying you all of a sudden.\n\n2:19:51.580 --> 2:19:53.780\n What bothers me though, I mean, personally,\n\n2:19:53.780 --> 2:19:56.180\n I don't like anyone dying anywhere,\n\n2:19:56.180 --> 2:20:00.100\n but, and especially considering what technology\n\n2:20:00.100 --> 2:20:02.340\n we're able to muster, yet we still kill each other.\n\n2:20:02.340 --> 2:20:04.500\n It's just a dichotomy to me.\n\n2:20:04.500 --> 2:20:07.660\n Yeah, but I mean, this is the, what is it, Paul Farmer?\n\n2:20:08.940 --> 2:20:10.140\n There's these great stories.\n\n2:20:10.140 --> 2:20:11.380\n I mean, that's the,\n\n2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:16.380\n that's the burden of being in healthcare,\n\n2:20:17.460 --> 2:20:22.460\n being a doctor, is you have to help.\n\n2:20:23.060 --> 2:20:25.260\n You can't help but help a person in front of you\n\n2:20:25.260 --> 2:20:28.580\n who's hurting, but you also are burdened\n\n2:20:28.580 --> 2:20:31.420\n by the knowledge that you helping them,\n\n2:20:31.420 --> 2:20:34.860\n you spending money and effort and time on them,\n\n2:20:34.860 --> 2:20:36.860\n means you're not going to help others,\n\n2:20:36.860 --> 2:20:38.540\n and you cannot possibly allocate\n\n2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:40.220\n that amount of time to everybody.\n\n2:20:40.220 --> 2:20:44.060\n So you're choosing which person lives and which person dies.\n\n2:20:44.060 --> 2:20:45.420\n And you're doing so,\n\n2:20:45.420 --> 2:20:47.740\n the reason you're helping the person in front of you\n\n2:20:47.740 --> 2:20:49.460\n is because they're in front of you.\n\n2:20:49.460 --> 2:20:53.260\n And so the reason right now we care a lot about COVID\n\n2:20:53.260 --> 2:20:56.620\n is because the eye of the world has turned to COVID,\n\n2:20:56.620 --> 2:20:59.300\n but we're not seeing all the other atrocities\n\n2:20:59.300 --> 2:21:00.460\n going on in the world.\n\n2:21:00.460 --> 2:21:02.780\n They're not necessarily related to deaths,\n\n2:21:02.780 --> 2:21:05.260\n they're related to suffering, human suffering,\n\n2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:07.420\n which you could argue is worse than death,\n\n2:21:07.420 --> 2:21:08.660\n prolonged suffering.\n\n2:21:08.660 --> 2:21:11.620\n So there's all of these questions.\n\n2:21:11.620 --> 2:21:15.740\n And the fundamental question here is,\n\n2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:19.340\n are we overreacting to COVID in our policies?\n\n2:21:19.340 --> 2:21:23.700\n So this is the, when we turn our eye\n\n2:21:23.700 --> 2:21:26.900\n and care about this particular thing and not other things,\n\n2:21:26.900 --> 2:21:29.180\n are we dismissing the pain that business owners\n\n2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:31.660\n who've lost their businesses are going to feel?\n\n2:21:31.660 --> 2:21:35.660\n And then the long, talking about long COVID,\n\n2:21:35.660 --> 2:21:39.380\n the long term effects, economic effects on the millions\n\n2:21:39.380 --> 2:21:42.460\n of people that will suffer, that suffer financially,\n\n2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:44.820\n but also suffer from their dreams\n\n2:21:44.820 --> 2:21:46.660\n being completely collapsed.\n\n2:21:46.660 --> 2:21:50.700\n So a lot of people seek gain meaning from work.\n\n2:21:50.700 --> 2:21:52.820\n And if you take away that work,\n\n2:21:52.820 --> 2:21:55.660\n there's anger that can be born, there's pain.\n\n2:21:55.660 --> 2:21:57.180\n And so what does that lead to?\n\n2:21:57.180 --> 2:22:01.860\n That can lead to the rising up of charismatic leaders\n\n2:22:01.860 --> 2:22:05.100\n that channel that anger towards destructive things.\n\n2:22:05.100 --> 2:22:06.700\n That's been done throughout history.\n\n2:22:06.700 --> 2:22:10.220\n So you have to balance that with the policies\n\n2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:12.060\n that you have in COVID.\n\n2:22:12.060 --> 2:22:16.220\n And then, I mean, very much my main opposition\n\n2:22:16.220 --> 2:22:20.700\n to Fauci is not on the details, but the final result,\n\n2:22:20.700 --> 2:22:25.020\n which is I just observe that there's a significant decrease\n\n2:22:25.020 --> 2:22:30.020\n in trust in science as a, not the institution,\n\n2:22:30.500 --> 2:22:32.700\n but the very sort of mechanisms of science.\n\n2:22:32.700 --> 2:22:35.860\n I think science is both beautiful and powerful.\n\n2:22:35.860 --> 2:22:38.220\n And the reason why we have so many amazing things\n\n2:22:38.220 --> 2:22:40.460\n and such a high quality of life.\n\n2:22:40.460 --> 2:22:44.020\n And distrust in that, that the thing we need now\n\n2:22:44.020 --> 2:22:46.580\n to get out of all the troubles we're in,\n\n2:22:46.580 --> 2:22:49.660\n continue getting out of the troubles we're in is science,\n\n2:22:49.660 --> 2:22:53.300\n the scientific process, broadly defined like innovation,\n\n2:22:53.300 --> 2:22:55.660\n technological innovation, scientific innovation,\n\n2:22:55.660 --> 2:23:00.660\n all of that, distrust in that is totally\n\n2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:02.460\n the wrong thing we need.\n\n2:23:02.460 --> 2:23:04.780\n And so anybody who gets in,\n\n2:23:04.780 --> 2:23:07.860\n who causes a distrust in science to me,\n\n2:23:12.220 --> 2:23:14.220\n carries the responsibility of that\n\n2:23:14.220 --> 2:23:16.980\n and should be in, because the response,\n\n2:23:16.980 --> 2:23:20.060\n I mean, should be fired, should be,\n\n2:23:20.060 --> 2:23:24.380\n or at least openly have to carry the burden of that,\n\n2:23:24.380 --> 2:23:27.460\n of having caused of that kind of level of mistrust.\n\n2:23:27.460 --> 2:23:30.460\n Now, it's maybe unfair to place it on any one individual,\n\n2:23:30.460 --> 2:23:34.060\n but you have to, I think in your pocket said,\n\n2:23:34.060 --> 2:23:37.660\n the buck stops at the top, like the leaders have to.\n\n2:23:37.660 --> 2:23:40.980\n No, no, there's a clear leader here, yes, absolutely.\n\n2:23:40.980 --> 2:23:44.060\n So even if it's not directly his fault,\n\n2:23:44.060 --> 2:23:48.340\n he has to carry the price of that.\n\n2:23:48.340 --> 2:23:50.900\n Do you think we should at this point say,\n\n2:23:50.900 --> 2:23:53.420\n okay, we have vaccines,\n\n2:23:53.420 --> 2:23:55.420\n you can decide whether you take them or not,\n\n2:23:55.420 --> 2:23:56.540\n let's move forward?\n\n2:23:57.420 --> 2:23:59.180\n Maybe you can help me understand this,\n\n2:23:59.180 --> 2:24:04.180\n because it seems like, why is that not the right solution?\n\n2:24:04.540 --> 2:24:07.220\n Completely open society, the vaccines,\n\n2:24:07.220 --> 2:24:09.780\n at least in the United States,\n\n2:24:09.780 --> 2:24:14.140\n as I understand are widely available.\n\n2:24:14.140 --> 2:24:18.340\n So this is the American way, you have the decision to make.\n\n2:24:18.340 --> 2:24:23.260\n If you have conditions that make you worried to get COVID\n\n2:24:23.260 --> 2:24:26.180\n and go to the hospital, then you should get vaccinated\n\n2:24:26.180 --> 2:24:27.820\n because here's the data that shows\n\n2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:30.820\n that it's much less likely for you to die\n\n2:24:31.980 --> 2:24:34.260\n if you get vaccinated,\n\n2:24:34.260 --> 2:24:35.780\n if you don't want to get vaccinated\n\n2:24:35.780 --> 2:24:39.300\n because you're worried about longterm effects of vaccine\n\n2:24:39.300 --> 2:24:40.340\n that you don't have to,\n\n2:24:40.340 --> 2:24:43.100\n but then you suffer the consequences of that,\n\n2:24:43.100 --> 2:24:44.420\n and that's it.\n\n2:24:44.420 --> 2:24:47.260\n So here's what I think is driving,\n\n2:24:47.260 --> 2:24:48.700\n I think it's all about kids,\n\n2:24:50.220 --> 2:24:51.940\n because they're gonna go back to school in the fall\n\n2:24:51.940 --> 2:24:53.980\n and many of them can't be vaccinated.\n\n2:24:53.980 --> 2:24:58.980\n So if they get infected, they do have less frequency\n\n2:24:59.060 --> 2:25:01.260\n of disease, but it's not zero.\n\n2:25:01.260 --> 2:25:04.740\n They do get sick and they can have longterm consequences.\n\n2:25:04.740 --> 2:25:09.340\n And at that age, it would be a shame, right?\n\n2:25:09.340 --> 2:25:10.620\n And not even their choice,\n\n2:25:10.620 --> 2:25:13.460\n they can't decide to get vaccinated or not\n\n2:25:13.460 --> 2:25:15.220\n because they can't have access to it.\n\n2:25:15.220 --> 2:25:19.380\n So I think that's what would drive my efforts\n\n2:25:19.380 --> 2:25:22.540\n to try and get more people, at least in schools, vaccinated,\n\n2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:24.660\n but I might be wrong, it may not be that.\n\n2:25:24.660 --> 2:25:26.540\n So can you kind of dig into that a little bit?\n\n2:25:26.540 --> 2:25:27.380\n So there's,\n\n2:25:30.740 --> 2:25:33.260\n so you're saying that there should be an effort\n\n2:25:33.260 --> 2:25:37.620\n for increased vaccinations of kids going to school,\n\n2:25:37.620 --> 2:25:39.900\n just not for societal benefit,\n\n2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:42.260\n but for the benefit of each individual kid, right?\n\n2:25:42.260 --> 2:25:46.140\n So right now, kids under 12, right,\n\n2:25:46.140 --> 2:25:48.540\n are not yet vaccinated, is that correct?\n\n2:25:48.540 --> 2:25:49.940\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n2:25:49.940 --> 2:25:53.420\n And it's not gonna be in time for school opening\n\n2:25:53.420 --> 2:25:54.780\n that they get vaccinated.\n\n2:25:56.700 --> 2:25:59.700\n And then, I suppose the teachers\n\n2:25:59.700 --> 2:26:01.380\n are all gonna be vaccinated,\n\n2:26:01.380 --> 2:26:02.780\n makes sense for them to do that,\n\n2:26:02.780 --> 2:26:04.100\n but I'm just worried the kids\n\n2:26:04.100 --> 2:26:05.980\n are gonna be transmitting it amongst them\n\n2:26:05.980 --> 2:26:08.900\n and many states don't allow mask mandate in school.\n\n2:26:08.900 --> 2:26:13.900\n So I think that's what's driving the larger narrative\n\n2:26:14.060 --> 2:26:16.740\n in the US to protect kids.\n\n2:26:16.740 --> 2:26:18.940\n It's kind of what I hear from Daniel Griffin,\n\n2:26:18.940 --> 2:26:21.620\n because increasing numbers of kids\n\n2:26:21.620 --> 2:26:23.980\n are being admitted to hospitals now,\n\n2:26:23.980 --> 2:26:28.260\n because they're becoming the major unvaccinated population.\n\n2:26:28.260 --> 2:26:29.620\n They're hanging out over the summer\n\n2:26:29.620 --> 2:26:32.260\n and that's just gonna get worse in the fall.\n\n2:26:32.260 --> 2:26:35.380\n And so you could have a lot of kids with long COVID\n\n2:26:35.380 --> 2:26:38.300\n and disabled their entire lives, right, so.\n\n2:26:38.300 --> 2:26:42.060\n And of course, hearing from people who are vaccine hesitant,\n\n2:26:42.060 --> 2:26:44.820\n I hear exactly the kids statement,\n\n2:26:44.820 --> 2:26:47.100\n but they're saying they don't want\n\n2:26:47.100 --> 2:26:52.100\n the long term effects of the vaccine to affect the kids.\n\n2:26:53.220 --> 2:26:56.020\n That's of this new vaccine.\n\n2:26:56.020 --> 2:26:58.620\n Which I would say is, as I said before,\n\n2:26:58.620 --> 2:27:00.620\n you can't say never,\n\n2:27:00.620 --> 2:27:05.620\n but we do know that long COVID exists.\n\n2:27:05.900 --> 2:27:06.860\n We don't know for how long,\n\n2:27:06.860 --> 2:27:09.300\n because we've only looked out six or eight months.\n\n2:27:09.300 --> 2:27:12.380\n We know that exists and the frequency is increasing.\n\n2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:14.260\n It certainly exists in young kids\n\n2:27:14.260 --> 2:27:16.540\n and we have no idea about long vaccine effects.\n\n2:27:16.540 --> 2:27:20.660\n So I think they have to make their decision based on that.\n\n2:27:22.820 --> 2:27:24.420\n But yeah.\n\n2:27:24.420 --> 2:27:28.180\n But your question is why don't we just open up society,\n\n2:27:28.180 --> 2:27:29.580\n say here we have these vaccines\n\n2:27:29.580 --> 2:27:30.780\n if you wanna protect yourself.\n\n2:27:30.780 --> 2:27:32.140\n I think it's mainly the school\n\n2:27:32.140 --> 2:27:35.300\n that's driving the whole narrative, that's my opinion.\n\n2:27:35.300 --> 2:27:37.740\n In which direction, not to open up or?\n\n2:27:37.740 --> 2:27:41.380\n No, to open up, but to try and get their efforts\n\n2:27:41.380 --> 2:27:43.940\n at the federal level to get people vaccinated, right?\n\n2:27:43.940 --> 2:27:45.940\n But see, how high are the risks for kids?\n\n2:27:45.940 --> 2:27:48.060\n I mean, my understanding was it's,\n\n2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:50.500\n I mean, yes, it's nonzero, but it's very low.\n\n2:27:52.220 --> 2:27:53.620\n But what is the numbers?\n\n2:27:53.620 --> 2:27:57.660\n Now, 70,000 hospitalizations so far\n\n2:27:57.660 --> 2:27:59.740\n in kids as of last week.\n\n2:27:59.740 --> 2:28:04.740\n So yes, it's low, but polio was low.\n\n2:28:05.380 --> 2:28:08.740\n Polio was 20, 30,000 kids a year paralyzed.\n\n2:28:08.740 --> 2:28:11.460\n And well, many people have actually argued\n\n2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:13.540\n that that vaccine wasn't necessary.\n\n2:28:13.540 --> 2:28:17.300\n Now, that wasn't a substantial enough health problem.\n\n2:28:17.300 --> 2:28:18.980\n But paralyzed is different than hospital.\n\n2:28:18.980 --> 2:28:20.860\n So what does hospitalized mean?\n\n2:28:20.860 --> 2:28:21.700\n Long COVID.\n\n2:28:21.700 --> 2:28:23.060\n But this is the long COVID question.\n\n2:28:23.060 --> 2:28:24.540\n I mean, this is the open question.\n\n2:28:24.540 --> 2:28:26.420\n It was long COVID in kids.\n\n2:28:26.420 --> 2:28:27.820\n What is that?\n\n2:28:27.820 --> 2:28:30.660\n Well, a lot of the same issues,\n\n2:28:30.660 --> 2:28:34.180\n cognitive issues, motor issues,\n\n2:28:34.180 --> 2:28:37.700\n respiratory, GI dysfunction.\n\n2:28:37.700 --> 2:28:39.300\n How long?\n\n2:28:39.300 --> 2:28:40.140\n We don't know.\n\n2:28:41.100 --> 2:28:43.260\n I mean, it could end in a year.\n\n2:28:43.260 --> 2:28:47.460\n As you know, there are other post acute infectious sequelae\n\n2:28:47.460 --> 2:28:48.660\n that we know about.\n\n2:28:48.660 --> 2:28:51.420\n Chronic fatigue, ME, CFS is thought\n\n2:28:51.420 --> 2:28:53.220\n to be a post infectious sequelae,\n\n2:28:53.220 --> 2:28:55.140\n which has gone for many decades now\n\n2:28:55.140 --> 2:28:56.540\n in many millions of people.\n\n2:28:56.540 --> 2:28:58.740\n This could be another one of those.\n\n2:28:58.740 --> 2:29:02.060\n So I'm just saying it might be worth erring\n\n2:29:02.060 --> 2:29:05.860\n on the side of not letting the kids get infected.\n\n2:29:05.860 --> 2:29:09.860\n Yeah, well, I'm trying to keep an open mind here\n\n2:29:09.860 --> 2:29:12.060\n and I appreciate you doing the same.\n\n2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:17.060\n Of course, I lean on definitely not requiring people\n\n2:29:18.500 --> 2:29:19.340\n to get vaccinated,\n\n2:29:19.340 --> 2:29:21.540\n but I do think getting vaccinated\n\n2:29:21.540 --> 2:29:24.980\n is just the wiser choice,\n\n2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:28.460\n looking at all the different trajectories before us.\n\n2:29:28.460 --> 2:29:33.220\n Getting vaccinated seems like from the data,\n\n2:29:33.220 --> 2:29:35.500\n it seems like the obvious choice, frankly.\n\n2:29:35.500 --> 2:29:38.100\n But I'm also trying to keep an open mind\n\n2:29:38.100 --> 2:29:40.100\n because some things in the past that seemed obvious\n\n2:29:40.100 --> 2:29:42.100\n would turn out to be completely wrong.\n\n2:29:42.100 --> 2:29:44.820\n So I'm trying to keep an open mind here.\n\n2:29:44.820 --> 2:29:48.100\n So for example, one of the things,\n\n2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:52.980\n I'd love to get your thoughts on this is antiviral ideas.\n\n2:29:52.980 --> 2:29:55.020\n So ideas outside of the vaccine.\n\n2:29:56.020 --> 2:30:00.380\n So ivermectin, something that Brett Weinstein\n\n2:30:00.380 --> 2:30:02.100\n and a few others have been talking about.\n\n2:30:02.100 --> 2:30:03.180\n There's been a few studies.\n\n2:30:03.180 --> 2:30:07.100\n Some of them have been shown not to be very good studies,\n\n2:30:07.100 --> 2:30:11.460\n but nevertheless, there seems to be some promise.\n\n2:30:11.460 --> 2:30:14.500\n And I wanted to talk to Brett\n\n2:30:14.500 --> 2:30:17.300\n about this particular topic for two reasons.\n\n2:30:17.300 --> 2:30:19.940\n One, I was really bothered by censorship of this.\n\n2:30:19.940 --> 2:30:22.060\n That's a whole nother topic.\n\n2:30:22.060 --> 2:30:25.940\n I just, I'm bothered by censorship.\n\n2:30:25.940 --> 2:30:27.500\n There's a gray area, of course,\n\n2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:32.180\n but it just feels like that should not have been censored\n\n2:30:32.180 --> 2:30:34.900\n from YouTube, like discussions of ivermectin.\n\n2:30:34.900 --> 2:30:36.740\n We can set that aside.\n\n2:30:36.740 --> 2:30:39.260\n The other thing I was bothered by\n\n2:30:39.260 --> 2:30:42.100\n the lack of open mindedness\n\n2:30:42.100 --> 2:30:46.780\n on exploring things like ivermectin in the early days,\n\n2:30:46.780 --> 2:30:49.140\n especially when at least I thought\n\n2:30:49.140 --> 2:30:51.660\n the vaccine would take a long time.\n\n2:30:51.660 --> 2:30:53.140\n I mean, it's not just ivermectin.\n\n2:30:53.140 --> 2:30:57.500\n It's really seriously at a large scale,\n\n2:30:57.500 --> 2:31:01.340\n rigorously exploring the effectiveness of masks.\n\n2:31:01.340 --> 2:31:03.700\n And the big one for me is testing.\n\n2:31:03.700 --> 2:31:07.020\n Like the fact that that wasn't explored aggressively\n\n2:31:07.020 --> 2:31:11.500\n to lead to mass manufacturing like May, 2020 is absurd.\n\n2:31:11.500 --> 2:31:14.780\n Anyway, so I was bothered by these solutions\n\n2:31:14.780 --> 2:31:16.860\n not being explored and not by now\n\n2:31:16.860 --> 2:31:19.620\n having really good ivermectin studies.\n\n2:31:19.620 --> 2:31:20.980\n Can I talk about ivermectin?\n\n2:31:20.980 --> 2:31:21.820\n Yeah, I would love that, yeah.\n\n2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:23.060\n Sure, so full disclosure,\n\n2:31:23.060 --> 2:31:26.580\n my wife worked on ivermectin at Merck for 20 years.\n\n2:31:26.580 --> 2:31:30.940\n Okay, so they just want people to know,\n\n2:31:30.940 --> 2:31:34.580\n but I don't talk to her all the time about it.\n\n2:31:34.580 --> 2:31:37.220\n And anyway, she hasn't been at Merck for a long time.\n\n2:31:37.220 --> 2:31:39.900\n As you know, ivermectin is a very safe drug\n\n2:31:39.900 --> 2:31:43.580\n used to treat certain parasitic infections, right?\n\n2:31:43.580 --> 2:31:47.300\n And it is approved, it's amazing.\n\n2:31:47.300 --> 2:31:48.660\n You can take one dose a year\n\n2:31:48.660 --> 2:31:51.660\n and be protected against river blindness in Africa\n\n2:31:51.660 --> 2:31:52.700\n and certain parts of Africa.\n\n2:31:52.700 --> 2:31:54.660\n It's remarkably effective.\n\n2:31:54.660 --> 2:31:57.820\n And so it's quite a safe drug\n\n2:31:57.820 --> 2:32:01.260\n at the doses that are approved.\n\n2:32:01.260 --> 2:32:04.500\n Now, early last year, a study was done,\n\n2:32:04.500 --> 2:32:07.380\n I believe in Australia, which showed in cells in the lab,\n\n2:32:07.380 --> 2:32:11.100\n if you infect with SARS CoV2 and then put ivermectin in,\n\n2:32:11.100 --> 2:32:13.860\n it would inhibit the virus production substantially.\n\n2:32:13.860 --> 2:32:16.020\n It was quite clear, right?\n\n2:32:16.020 --> 2:32:19.660\n But the concentrations they were using were rather high\n\n2:32:19.660 --> 2:32:24.660\n and could not be achieved by the approved dosing.\n\n2:32:24.660 --> 2:32:27.860\n So you would need to do a dosing study\n\n2:32:27.860 --> 2:32:28.700\n to make sure it's safe.\n\n2:32:28.700 --> 2:32:32.060\n And the reason is that ivermectin binds to receptors\n\n2:32:32.060 --> 2:32:34.300\n in your brain and it can have high doses.\n\n2:32:34.300 --> 2:32:37.500\n So some people take high doses inappropriately\n\n2:32:37.500 --> 2:32:39.660\n and they have neurological consequences.\n\n2:32:39.660 --> 2:32:42.660\n So if you needed 10 times more ivermectin,\n\n2:32:42.660 --> 2:32:44.980\n you'd have to make sure it would be safe in people.\n\n2:32:44.980 --> 2:32:46.460\n So this is a question of safety too.\n\n2:32:46.460 --> 2:32:51.340\n Right, so I think it has always been the case\n\n2:32:51.340 --> 2:32:54.580\n that it should have been properly studied, but it wasn't.\n\n2:32:54.580 --> 2:32:56.140\n There were lots of trials here and there,\n\n2:32:56.140 --> 2:32:58.700\n lots of improperly controlled trials\n\n2:32:58.700 --> 2:33:00.780\n where someone would just treat some patients\n\n2:33:00.780 --> 2:33:03.780\n and say, hey, they all did fine, but have no control arm.\n\n2:33:03.780 --> 2:33:05.260\n And there were some controlled trials,\n\n2:33:05.260 --> 2:33:06.500\n but they were very small.\n\n2:33:06.500 --> 2:33:11.500\n So right now, a 4,000 person trial is enrolling\n\n2:33:12.660 --> 2:33:16.660\n to test in a randomly controlled trial setting,\n\n2:33:16.660 --> 2:33:17.820\n whether it works or not.\n\n2:33:17.820 --> 2:33:20.340\n There's still plenty of cases that you can do that.\n\n2:33:20.340 --> 2:33:23.060\n So you can ask whether there are any side effects.\n\n2:33:23.060 --> 2:33:25.020\n I think that's completely fine.\n\n2:33:25.020 --> 2:33:28.540\n And if it says it works, then we should use it.\n\n2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:31.340\n In the meantime, I always tell people,\n\n2:33:31.340 --> 2:33:33.820\n if you wanna use ivermectin, you can do it off label.\n\n2:33:33.820 --> 2:33:35.700\n It's FDA approved.\n\n2:33:35.700 --> 2:33:36.780\n And if your physician says,\n\n2:33:36.780 --> 2:33:38.740\n I'm gonna give you this off label,\n\n2:33:38.740 --> 2:33:41.580\n I don't have any objection,\n\n2:33:41.580 --> 2:33:43.780\n but I don't know if it's gonna work.\n\n2:33:43.780 --> 2:33:48.780\n Now, a friend of ours last week in New Jersey got COVID.\n\n2:33:49.260 --> 2:33:50.540\n He went to his local hospital\n\n2:33:50.540 --> 2:33:55.540\n and their regimen was remdesivir, dexamethasone, ivermectin.\n\n2:33:56.580 --> 2:33:59.140\n It's written, that's what they do for every COVID patient.\n\n2:33:59.140 --> 2:34:01.140\n They just give it to them automatically.\n\n2:34:01.140 --> 2:34:04.300\n And so he recovered.\n\n2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:08.320\n So who's to say it was or was not ivermectin, right?\n\n2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:12.820\n So I don't have any strong ideological opposition.\n\n2:34:12.820 --> 2:34:14.620\n I just think it should be tested\n\n2:34:14.620 --> 2:34:16.660\n for what you wanna use it for.\n\n2:34:16.660 --> 2:34:19.260\n And that's being done, and I think that's fine.\n\n2:34:19.260 --> 2:34:23.500\n Is it strange to you that ivermectin\n\n2:34:23.500 --> 2:34:24.780\n or other things like it\n\n2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:27.660\n weren't tested aggressively in the beginning?\n\n2:34:27.660 --> 2:34:32.660\n From a broad scientific community aspect,\n\n2:34:33.940 --> 2:34:35.980\n I can be a little bit conspiratorial,\n\n2:34:35.980 --> 2:34:39.060\n and this is what people talk about with ivermectin,\n\n2:34:39.060 --> 2:34:40.420\n is with the vaccines,\n\n2:34:40.420 --> 2:34:42.700\n there's quite a lot of money to be made.\n\n2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:45.660\n With ivermectin, there's not as much money to be made.\n\n2:34:45.660 --> 2:34:48.380\n Is that too conspiratorial?\n\n2:34:48.380 --> 2:34:51.500\n Like why didn't we try more solutions in the beginning?\n\n2:34:51.500 --> 2:34:55.580\n Well, all the money was put into vaccines, right?\n\n2:34:55.580 --> 2:34:57.340\n Very little was put into antivirals,\n\n2:34:57.340 --> 2:34:59.520\n because the decision was made at a very high level,\n\n2:34:59.520 --> 2:35:01.620\n probably involving Dr. Fauci.\n\n2:35:01.620 --> 2:35:04.760\n We're gonna put 24 billion into vaccines, right?\n\n2:35:06.220 --> 2:35:08.020\n And I think part of the reasoning is\n\n2:35:08.020 --> 2:35:10.100\n they give you years worth of protection,\n\n2:35:10.100 --> 2:35:11.380\n whereas an antiviral works\n\n2:35:11.380 --> 2:35:13.240\n and you have to keep dosing and so forth.\n\n2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:16.000\n But ivermectin is not trivial in this.\n\n2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.620\n I agree, it should have been tested early on,\n\n2:35:18.620 --> 2:35:21.820\n but we had a really bad experience with hydroxychloroquine,\n\n2:35:21.820 --> 2:35:23.860\n which we can talk about too.\n\n2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:28.740\n Ivermectin is very hard to synthesize.\n\n2:35:28.740 --> 2:35:31.620\n Most drugs, you synthesize chemically.\n\n2:35:31.620 --> 2:35:34.660\n You devise a formulation and a synthesis,\n\n2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:36.660\n and they do it, they scale it up, and it's fine.\n\n2:35:36.660 --> 2:35:38.340\n Ivermectin is really hard.\n\n2:35:38.340 --> 2:35:41.540\n And so what they do instead is they take the culture\n\n2:35:41.540 --> 2:35:43.820\n of the bacterium that makes it,\n\n2:35:43.820 --> 2:35:45.420\n and they grow it up, and they ferment it,\n\n2:35:45.420 --> 2:35:47.180\n and then they purify it.\n\n2:35:47.180 --> 2:35:50.140\n And Merck owns the bacteria.\n\n2:35:51.380 --> 2:35:55.420\n A number of years ago, two employees of Merck stole it\n\n2:35:55.420 --> 2:35:58.140\n and left the company and tried to market it,\n\n2:35:58.140 --> 2:35:59.980\n and they were arrested and they got put in jail.\n\n2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:02.740\n So they protect it very carefully.\n\n2:36:02.740 --> 2:36:05.580\n So you can't just make it.\n\n2:36:05.580 --> 2:36:07.660\n If you do, it's incredibly expensive.\n\n2:36:07.660 --> 2:36:10.140\n And now India, it's very cheap apparently.\n\n2:36:10.140 --> 2:36:12.540\n They use it quite liberally there,\n\n2:36:12.540 --> 2:36:14.420\n and I don't know how they're making it.\n\n2:36:14.420 --> 2:36:16.660\n Maybe they've licensed it from Merck and so forth.\n\n2:36:16.660 --> 2:36:21.620\n But that's why it hasn't been tested more widely, I think.\n\n2:36:21.620 --> 2:36:24.140\n There's complexities in terms of getting a lot of it\n\n2:36:24.140 --> 2:36:25.420\n and manufacturing a lot of it.\n\n2:36:25.420 --> 2:36:26.420\n Yes. Okay.\n\n2:36:26.420 --> 2:36:28.420\n So what was the hydroxychloroquine?\n\n2:36:28.420 --> 2:36:32.300\n So hydroxychloroquine was also shown early on\n\n2:36:32.300 --> 2:36:34.400\n to inhibit virus in cell culture.\n\n2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:37.340\n And that's not surprising.\n\n2:36:37.340 --> 2:36:41.260\n Hydroxychloroquine, of course, is used for malaria.\n\n2:36:41.260 --> 2:36:46.260\n And what it does, when your cell takes up things\n\n2:36:46.260 --> 2:36:49.620\n from the plasma membrane, including viruses,\n\n2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:52.140\n it goes through a pathway called the endocytic pathway,\n\n2:36:52.140 --> 2:36:54.100\n which involves a vesicle moving through the cell.\n\n2:36:54.100 --> 2:36:57.580\n And as it moves through the cell, its pH drops.\n\n2:36:57.580 --> 2:37:00.180\n And that lets a lot of viruses out actually.\n\n2:37:00.180 --> 2:37:01.820\n And hydroxychloroquine blocks that.\n\n2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:04.120\n So it blocks infection with a lot of viruses.\n\n2:37:06.340 --> 2:37:10.140\n So the problem with those early studies that were published\n\n2:37:10.140 --> 2:37:14.100\n is that they were done in kidney cells and culture,\n\n2:37:14.100 --> 2:37:16.280\n where the only way the virus can get in\n\n2:37:16.280 --> 2:37:17.540\n is through the endosome.\n\n2:37:18.820 --> 2:37:20.940\n And hydroxychloroquine inhibits that,\n\n2:37:20.940 --> 2:37:24.420\n and that's why it inhibits in kidney cells and culture.\n\n2:37:24.420 --> 2:37:28.060\n But lung cells and respiratory cells of humans\n\n2:37:28.060 --> 2:37:31.540\n where the virus reproduces can get in two different ways.\n\n2:37:31.540 --> 2:37:34.680\n It can get in from this endocytic pathway,\n\n2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:37.860\n which is inhibited by hydroxychloroquine,\n\n2:37:37.860 --> 2:37:40.340\n or it can get in at the cell surface,\n\n2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:43.140\n which is not inhibited by hydroxychloroquine.\n\n2:37:43.140 --> 2:37:46.500\n So when you treat patients, it has no effect in the lung\n\n2:37:46.500 --> 2:37:50.160\n because the virus can just bypass it.\n\n2:37:50.160 --> 2:37:54.580\n And all the usage initially were based on\n\n2:37:54.580 --> 2:37:57.220\n the studies done in kidney cells and culture.\n\n2:37:57.220 --> 2:38:00.580\n So that was just wrong, scientifically incorrect,\n\n2:38:00.580 --> 2:38:02.980\n yet it drove a lot of, and today many people\n\n2:38:02.980 --> 2:38:04.980\n still think they should be taking it, but.\n\n2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:09.220\n So that not panning out kind of resulted\n\n2:38:09.220 --> 2:38:14.060\n in a loss of optimism about other similar things panning out.\n\n2:38:14.060 --> 2:38:17.860\n Well, that and many other repurposed drugs were tried,\n\n2:38:17.860 --> 2:38:20.180\n and a lot of HIV antivirals were tried.\n\n2:38:20.180 --> 2:38:23.460\n I think the problem with hydroxychloroquine\n\n2:38:23.460 --> 2:38:26.060\n influenced the ivermectin narrative.\n\n2:38:26.060 --> 2:38:29.340\n People thought that the data was being hidden\n\n2:38:29.340 --> 2:38:30.940\n about hydroxychloroquine, so they said,\n\n2:38:30.940 --> 2:38:33.100\n well, they must be doing the same thing with ivermectin,\n\n2:38:33.100 --> 2:38:36.020\n but with hydroxychloroquine, it just scientifically\n\n2:38:36.020 --> 2:38:39.860\n could not work as an antiviral.\n\n2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:42.080\n The other problem that is more broad\n\n2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:43.980\n that is important to point out is that\n\n2:38:45.820 --> 2:38:49.580\n when you have COVID and you need an antiviral,\n\n2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:50.900\n it's usually because you can't breathe\n\n2:38:50.900 --> 2:38:52.920\n and you go in a hospital.\n\n2:38:52.920 --> 2:38:53.940\n Because if you're mildly ill,\n\n2:38:53.940 --> 2:38:55.340\n you're never gonna go to your doctor\n\n2:38:55.340 --> 2:38:56.820\n and ask for an antiviral.\n\n2:38:56.820 --> 2:38:58.380\n And the problem is when you can't breathe,\n\n2:38:58.380 --> 2:39:00.380\n it's no longer a viral issue.\n\n2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:02.260\n It is now an inflammatory issue,\n\n2:39:02.260 --> 2:39:05.300\n and no antiviral in the world is gonna help you.\n\n2:39:05.300 --> 2:39:08.980\n So that's why remdesivir doesn't work very well,\n\n2:39:08.980 --> 2:39:10.540\n because it's mainly given intravenously\n\n2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:13.100\n to people who go in a hospital.\n\n2:39:13.100 --> 2:39:16.740\n If you get ivermectin in the hospital,\n\n2:39:16.740 --> 2:39:18.980\n it's not gonna do anything for reducing virus,\n\n2:39:18.980 --> 2:39:20.860\n because by that time, you have very little virus\n\n2:39:20.860 --> 2:39:21.780\n to begin with.\n\n2:39:21.780 --> 2:39:23.140\n You have an inflammatory problem\n\n2:39:23.140 --> 2:39:24.860\n that you need to treat in other ways.\n\n2:39:24.860 --> 2:39:28.900\n So this is why a lot of the antivirals failed,\n\n2:39:28.900 --> 2:39:30.860\n because they're used too late.\n\n2:39:30.860 --> 2:39:32.980\n What you need is a pill you take\n\n2:39:32.980 --> 2:39:34.460\n on that first positive test,\n\n2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:36.780\n when you have a scratchy throat.\n\n2:39:36.780 --> 2:39:39.620\n You get a PCR in 15 minutes, I'm positive,\n\n2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:42.740\n take a pill, boom, that's gonna inhibit it.\n\n2:39:42.740 --> 2:39:44.900\n If you wait till you can't breathe,\n\n2:39:44.900 --> 2:39:47.580\n and that's why the monoclonals even don't work\n\n2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:49.140\n if you're in hospital that well,\n\n2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:50.140\n because it's too late.\n\n2:39:50.140 --> 2:39:54.360\n And the approach now is if you're in a high risk group,\n\n2:39:54.360 --> 2:39:58.900\n if you're over 65, if you are obese or have diabetes\n\n2:39:58.900 --> 2:40:00.700\n or any other comorbidities,\n\n2:40:00.700 --> 2:40:03.780\n your first sign of a scratchy throat positive,\n\n2:40:03.780 --> 2:40:07.300\n you get monoclonals, then they might help you.\n\n2:40:07.300 --> 2:40:09.820\n But if you wait till you go in a hospital, it's too late,\n\n2:40:09.820 --> 2:40:12.060\n because the viral curve drops.\n\n2:40:12.060 --> 2:40:15.540\n After that first symptom, within three days,\n\n2:40:15.540 --> 2:40:18.460\n you're no longer shedding enough virus to transmit.\n\n2:40:19.580 --> 2:40:20.700\n Drops really quickly.\n\n2:40:20.700 --> 2:40:23.180\n So that's the reason a lot of these antivirals failed,\n\n2:40:23.180 --> 2:40:25.860\n because they were tested in hospitalized patients.\n\n2:40:25.860 --> 2:40:29.500\n And we have nothing but remdesivir now, unfortunately.\n\n2:40:29.500 --> 2:40:30.940\n So it was the wrong approach.\n\n2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:33.780\n We should have been giving it to people\n\n2:40:33.780 --> 2:40:35.900\n who just tested positive from the start.\n\n2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:38.140\n Or just even for preventative and see.\n\n2:40:38.140 --> 2:40:39.660\n You could do that too.\n\n2:40:39.660 --> 2:40:42.040\n But I have to say, the other issue is,\n\n2:40:42.040 --> 2:40:45.020\n this molnupiravir is a drug in phase three now,\n\n2:40:45.020 --> 2:40:48.420\n it's an oral antiviral, it looks good.\n\n2:40:48.420 --> 2:40:51.140\n If we go ahead with just one,\n\n2:40:51.140 --> 2:40:53.320\n we're gonna get resistance within a few months,\n\n2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:54.360\n and it will be useless.\n\n2:40:54.360 --> 2:40:56.860\n We need to have at least two or three drugs\n\n2:40:56.860 --> 2:40:58.820\n that we can give in combinations.\n\n2:40:58.820 --> 2:41:01.700\n And we know that, because that's what took care of HIV,\n\n2:41:01.700 --> 2:41:05.260\n that's what took care of HCV, hepatitis C virus.\n\n2:41:05.260 --> 2:41:08.120\n It really reduces the emergence of resistance.\n\n2:41:08.980 --> 2:41:11.600\n Joe Rogan got quite a bit of heat recently\n\n2:41:11.600 --> 2:41:16.600\n about mentioning a paper and a broader idea,\n\n2:41:16.620 --> 2:41:19.920\n which I don't think is that controversial,\n\n2:41:19.920 --> 2:41:21.740\n but maybe we can expand on it.\n\n2:41:22.820 --> 2:41:26.180\n And the idea is that vaccines\n\n2:41:26.180 --> 2:41:31.180\n create selective pressure for a virus to mutate\n\n2:41:32.420 --> 2:41:34.300\n and for variants to form.\n\n2:41:37.380 --> 2:41:40.380\n First of all, from a biological perspective,\n\n2:41:40.380 --> 2:41:42.100\n can you explain this process?\n\n2:41:42.100 --> 2:41:45.680\n And from a societal perspective,\n\n2:41:45.680 --> 2:41:47.620\n what are we supposed to do about that?\n\n2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:49.580\n So let's get the terminology right.\n\n2:41:49.580 --> 2:41:51.860\n So as we talked about earlier,\n\n2:41:51.860 --> 2:41:54.060\n viruses are always mutating.\n\n2:41:54.060 --> 2:41:57.660\n So no vaccine or no drug makes a virus mutate.\n\n2:41:57.660 --> 2:41:59.460\n Right, that's the wrong perspective\n\n2:41:59.460 --> 2:42:01.180\n in which to look at it, got it.\n\n2:42:01.180 --> 2:42:04.940\n What the immune response is putting pressure,\n\n2:42:04.940 --> 2:42:07.020\n selection pressure on the virus.\n\n2:42:07.020 --> 2:42:11.500\n And if there's one particle with the right mutation\n\n2:42:11.500 --> 2:42:15.260\n that can escape the antibody, that will emerge, right?\n\n2:42:15.260 --> 2:42:17.700\n So that's what happens with influenza virus, right?\n\n2:42:17.700 --> 2:42:20.220\n We vaccinate every year,\n\n2:42:20.220 --> 2:42:22.160\n and there are not a lot of people that get infected,\n\n2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:24.780\n so they get natural immunity.\n\n2:42:24.780 --> 2:42:28.900\n And then the virus is incredibly varied.\n\n2:42:28.900 --> 2:42:30.260\n It mutates like crazy.\n\n2:42:30.260 --> 2:42:32.120\n And in some person somewhere,\n\n2:42:32.120 --> 2:42:34.380\n there's one variant that escapes the antibody,\n\n2:42:34.380 --> 2:42:37.100\n which has been induced either by infection or vaccination.\n\n2:42:37.100 --> 2:42:37.940\n It can be both.\n\n2:42:38.860 --> 2:42:41.260\n And that drives the emergence of the new variants,\n\n2:42:41.260 --> 2:42:43.860\n so the next year we need to change the vaccine.\n\n2:42:43.860 --> 2:42:48.860\n So I would say both natural infection and vaccination,\n\n2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:51.440\n sure, select for variants.\n\n2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:53.500\n Absolutely, there's no question,\n\n2:42:53.500 --> 2:42:55.420\n because they're inducing immunity.\n\n2:42:55.420 --> 2:43:00.060\n Now, what happened last year was at the beginning of 2020,\n\n2:43:00.060 --> 2:43:02.340\n very few people in the world were immune\n\n2:43:02.340 --> 2:43:04.900\n as the virus first started spreading.\n\n2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:09.140\n But you can see in the sequences of those isolates\n\n2:43:09.140 --> 2:43:11.040\n from the beginning of 2020,\n\n2:43:11.040 --> 2:43:14.660\n you can see all of the changes that are now present\n\n2:43:14.660 --> 2:43:17.700\n in the variants of concern at very, very low frequencies.\n\n2:43:17.700 --> 2:43:18.700\n They were already there,\n\n2:43:18.700 --> 2:43:21.940\n but there was no selection for them to emerge.\n\n2:43:21.940 --> 2:43:25.340\n Until November, when we now had many millions of people\n\n2:43:25.340 --> 2:43:29.780\n who had mostly been infected, but also some vaccinated,\n\n2:43:29.780 --> 2:43:33.060\n then we saw the alpha variant emerge in England,\n\n2:43:33.060 --> 2:43:35.360\n probably because of immune selection.\n\n2:43:35.360 --> 2:43:38.300\n Now, the virus that had the change\n\n2:43:38.300 --> 2:43:41.980\n that evaded the antibody had an advantage,\n\n2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:44.060\n and that virus drove through the population.\n\n2:43:44.060 --> 2:43:45.300\n So that's what we're seeing.\n\n2:43:45.300 --> 2:43:47.980\n All these variants are simply antigenic selection.\n\n2:43:47.980 --> 2:43:50.780\n So the variants, the mutations\n\n2:43:50.780 --> 2:43:55.500\n that are at the core of these, quote unquote, variants,\n\n2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:58.380\n they were always there all along the vaccine,\n\n2:43:58.380 --> 2:44:00.440\n or the infections did not create them.\n\n2:44:00.440 --> 2:44:02.660\n No, the infections don't create them, they're selected.\n\n2:44:02.660 --> 2:44:07.660\n It's like the vaccine wipe out a lot of the variants,\n\n2:44:09.020 --> 2:44:13.740\n and then by making your body immune to them,\n\n2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:15.540\n but some of them survive.\n\n2:44:15.540 --> 2:44:16.820\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:44:16.820 --> 2:44:19.500\n And then there's another tree that's built,\n\n2:44:19.500 --> 2:44:22.580\n and it's unclear what that tree leads to.\n\n2:44:23.880 --> 2:44:26.980\n I mean, it could make things much worse or much better,\n\n2:44:26.980 --> 2:44:28.340\n and we don't know.\n\n2:44:28.340 --> 2:44:31.220\n Well, with flu, we see year after year the virus changes,\n\n2:44:31.220 --> 2:44:33.580\n we change the vaccine, we deal with it,\n\n2:44:33.580 --> 2:44:35.540\n we change it again, there's an unending series.\n\n2:44:35.540 --> 2:44:37.260\n But see, that's a very different story.\n\n2:44:37.260 --> 2:44:42.260\n If, do you think COVID will be with some likelihood,\n\n2:44:42.260 --> 2:44:47.260\n like the flu, where it's basically variants,\n\n2:44:47.860 --> 2:44:52.780\n we'll never be able to eradicate it?\n\n2:44:52.780 --> 2:44:57.380\n It will never eradicate it in any case, ever.\n\n2:44:57.380 --> 2:44:59.820\n Well, come up with a vaccine\n\n2:44:59.820 --> 2:45:03.140\n that makes you immune to enough variants\n\n2:45:03.140 --> 2:45:07.240\n where there's not enough evolutionary room.\n\n2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:09.100\n Well, if you cut down the number of infections,\n\n2:45:09.100 --> 2:45:12.180\n then you reduce the diversity, sure, right?\n\n2:45:12.180 --> 2:45:15.140\n The problem is if, let's say you're a cynic\n\n2:45:15.140 --> 2:45:18.100\n and you say, well, vaccination is just selecting\n\n2:45:18.100 --> 2:45:20.020\n for variants, so let's stop it.\n\n2:45:20.020 --> 2:45:21.460\n But then you're gonna have infection,\n\n2:45:21.460 --> 2:45:23.280\n and that's gonna select for variants.\n\n2:45:23.280 --> 2:45:26.260\n And there, you're more likely to get very sick\n\n2:45:26.260 --> 2:45:28.620\n because we know the vaccines are really good\n\n2:45:28.620 --> 2:45:30.060\n at preventing you from dying.\n\n2:45:30.060 --> 2:45:34.060\n So that's why it still makes sense to use vaccines\n\n2:45:34.060 --> 2:45:36.900\n because they prevent you from dying.\n\n2:45:36.900 --> 2:45:38.180\n That's the bottom line.\n\n2:45:38.180 --> 2:45:43.180\n But can we ever make a vaccine that deals with all variants?\n\n2:45:44.560 --> 2:45:45.580\n Absolutely.\n\n2:45:45.580 --> 2:45:49.240\n And the reason I say that is because people\n\n2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:53.420\n who get naturally infected with SARS COVID,\n\n2:45:53.420 --> 2:45:55.120\n they develop COVID, they recover.\n\n2:45:56.860 --> 2:45:59.580\n If you give them one vaccine dose,\n\n2:45:59.580 --> 2:46:01.460\n they make an immune response\n\n2:46:01.460 --> 2:46:05.740\n that handles all the variants that are around right now.\n\n2:46:05.740 --> 2:46:06.580\n All of them.\n\n2:46:06.580 --> 2:46:10.380\n Much better than people who've gotten two doses of vaccine.\n\n2:46:10.380 --> 2:46:14.340\n For some reason, their immune response is suddenly broadened\n\n2:46:14.340 --> 2:46:16.860\n after the infection vaccination,\n\n2:46:16.860 --> 2:46:19.340\n and they can handle all the variants that we know of so far.\n\n2:46:19.340 --> 2:46:22.780\n So that tells me we can devise a strategy\n\n2:46:22.780 --> 2:46:24.540\n to do the same thing with a vaccine\n\n2:46:24.540 --> 2:46:26.620\n that makes a really broad vaccine\n\n2:46:26.620 --> 2:46:27.940\n that'll handle all the variants.\n\n2:46:27.940 --> 2:46:30.660\n Well, you actually, on the virology blog,\n\n2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:32.340\n I don't know if you're the author of that, but.\n\n2:46:32.340 --> 2:46:33.900\n I am, I am, yes.\n\n2:46:33.900 --> 2:46:36.820\n Oh, the blog, yes, but there's a particular post\n\n2:46:36.820 --> 2:46:39.400\n that's talking about reporting on a paper\n\n2:46:39.400 --> 2:46:40.860\n that a mix and match strategy.\n\n2:46:40.860 --> 2:46:44.180\n Oh, yes, that's one of my co writers, Trudy Ray, yeah.\n\n2:46:44.180 --> 2:46:46.620\n Yeah, it's an interesting idea\n\n2:46:46.620 --> 2:46:49.380\n that there's some early evidence now\n\n2:46:49.380 --> 2:46:52.380\n that mixing and matching vaccines,\n\n2:46:52.380 --> 2:46:56.500\n like one shot of Pfizer and one of like Moderna or something,\n\n2:46:56.500 --> 2:47:00.460\n that creates a much better immunity\n\n2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:02.820\n than does two shots of Pfizer.\n\n2:47:02.820 --> 2:47:05.420\n I think that's worth exploring, absolutely.\n\n2:47:05.420 --> 2:47:09.100\n And this is relevant, what we're doing with influenza,\n\n2:47:09.100 --> 2:47:11.240\n you know, instead of having to vaccinate people every year,\n\n2:47:11.240 --> 2:47:12.860\n why can't we devise a vaccine\n\n2:47:12.860 --> 2:47:14.780\n which you'd get once in your lifetime\n\n2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:17.420\n or maybe once every 10 years, okay?\n\n2:47:17.420 --> 2:47:22.420\n So the spike of influenza, it's a long protein,\n\n2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:24.740\n kind of like the spike of SARS CoV2,\n\n2:47:24.740 --> 2:47:26.340\n it's stuck in the virus membrane,\n\n2:47:26.340 --> 2:47:31.340\n and the very tip, that's the part that changes every year.\n\n2:47:31.340 --> 2:47:33.740\n This is where the antibodies bind.\n\n2:47:33.740 --> 2:47:36.480\n But the stem doesn't change.\n\n2:47:37.540 --> 2:47:39.860\n And if you make antibodies to the stem,\n\n2:47:39.860 --> 2:47:41.660\n they can also prevent infection.\n\n2:47:41.660 --> 2:47:44.020\n It's just that when people are infected\n\n2:47:44.020 --> 2:47:45.940\n or with the current vaccines,\n\n2:47:45.940 --> 2:47:48.820\n they don't make many antibodies to that stem part,\n\n2:47:48.820 --> 2:47:51.380\n but we're trying to figure out how to make those\n\n2:47:51.380 --> 2:47:53.620\n and we think they would be broadly protective\n\n2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:55.400\n and you'd never be able to,\n\n2:47:55.400 --> 2:47:59.020\n or more rarely be able to have a variant emerge\n\n2:47:59.020 --> 2:48:00.820\n that escaped it.\n\n2:48:00.820 --> 2:48:02.460\n And I think we can do the same thing\n\n2:48:02.460 --> 2:48:05.500\n with coronavirus too, for sure.\n\n2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:08.380\n Can I ask you about testing?\n\n2:48:08.380 --> 2:48:10.220\n Sure, sure.\n\n2:48:10.220 --> 2:48:13.300\n You mentioned PCR, what kind of tests are there?\n\n2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:18.160\n The antigen test, what are your thoughts on each?\n\n2:48:18.160 --> 2:48:22.460\n Maybe this is a good place to also mention like viral load\n\n2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:27.460\n and the history of the virus as it passes through your body\n\n2:48:27.460 --> 2:48:31.260\n in terms of what's being tested for\n\n2:48:31.260 --> 2:48:33.380\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:48:33.380 --> 2:48:38.380\n So the first tests that were developed were PCR,\n\n2:48:39.100 --> 2:48:40.260\n polymerase chain reaction.\n\n2:48:40.260 --> 2:48:43.780\n They're basically nucleic acid amplification tests.\n\n2:48:43.780 --> 2:48:44.820\n And they were very first ones.\n\n2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:47.980\n They stuck the swab all the way up into your brain almost.\n\n2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:50.860\n I had that done a couple of weeks ago.\n\n2:48:50.860 --> 2:48:53.420\n Oh my gosh, it's really nasty.\n\n2:48:53.420 --> 2:48:56.280\n But now they do an anterior Nares swab.\n\n2:48:56.280 --> 2:48:58.940\n They get a little, they get a bunch of cells\n\n2:48:58.940 --> 2:49:02.660\n and some mucus which has virus and parts of virus,\n\n2:49:02.660 --> 2:49:05.980\n stick it in a test tube and then they run a reaction\n\n2:49:05.980 --> 2:49:09.020\n which by the way involves reverse transcriptase\n\n2:49:09.020 --> 2:49:11.980\n because it converts the viral RNA to DNA\n\n2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:14.240\n and then you amplify it.\n\n2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:18.940\n And you can specify what part of the viral RNA\n\n2:49:18.940 --> 2:49:22.540\n you wanna amplify and then a machine will detect it\n\n2:49:22.540 --> 2:49:25.100\n and it can be done in 15 minutes.\n\n2:49:25.100 --> 2:49:29.100\n But you're detecting pieces of RNA, not infectious virus.\n\n2:49:29.100 --> 2:49:32.420\n So we're measuring viral RNA loads, right?\n\n2:49:32.420 --> 2:49:36.060\n And a common mistake that many people\n\n2:49:36.060 --> 2:49:38.700\n who should know better, physicians and scientists\n\n2:49:38.700 --> 2:49:41.180\n of all kinds, they think that indicates\n\n2:49:41.180 --> 2:49:42.640\n how much virus you have.\n\n2:49:43.620 --> 2:49:44.440\n It doesn't.\n\n2:49:45.580 --> 2:49:48.620\n It's a diagnostic of whether you have bits of RNA in you\n\n2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:51.320\n and it probably means you're infected.\n\n2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:55.300\n But you can't use it to shed light on what's going on\n\n2:49:55.300 --> 2:49:56.880\n and I'll tell you why in a bit.\n\n2:49:56.880 --> 2:49:59.520\n But first we have to explain some other things.\n\n2:50:01.940 --> 2:50:06.380\n So until you get to about a million copies of RNA,\n\n2:50:06.380 --> 2:50:08.540\n so you can measure the copy number in this test,\n\n2:50:08.540 --> 2:50:09.700\n this PCR test.\n\n2:50:10.660 --> 2:50:13.860\n It's a number called CT or cycle threshold.\n\n2:50:13.860 --> 2:50:16.420\n The test, the way the machine works, it goes through cycles\n\n2:50:16.420 --> 2:50:19.980\n and every cycle it amplifies what you put in\n\n2:50:19.980 --> 2:50:23.900\n and the more cycles you need to see something,\n\n2:50:23.900 --> 2:50:26.660\n that means there's not a lot of RNA there.\n\n2:50:26.660 --> 2:50:31.100\n So if you do a test and you have a cycle threshold of 35,\n\n2:50:31.100 --> 2:50:33.660\n you have very little RNA in you.\n\n2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:36.160\n Contrary, if you have a cycle threshold of 10,\n\n2:50:36.160 --> 2:50:38.700\n you have a ton of RNA and it only took 10 cycles\n\n2:50:38.700 --> 2:50:39.540\n to detect it.\n\n2:50:40.700 --> 2:50:42.780\n And you can extrapolate from that number,\n\n2:50:42.780 --> 2:50:46.100\n the number of copies you have per sample, say per swab.\n\n2:50:46.100 --> 2:50:49.120\n And if you don't have a million, you're not infectious.\n\n2:50:49.120 --> 2:50:50.740\n You're not gonna infect anyone.\n\n2:50:50.740 --> 2:50:53.300\n So in the early days, no matter what CT,\n\n2:50:53.300 --> 2:50:56.020\n what PCR result you had, they would quarantine you.\n\n2:50:56.020 --> 2:50:58.340\n And that was wrong because you're not shedding.\n\n2:50:58.340 --> 2:51:00.020\n You don't need to be quarantined,\n\n2:51:00.020 --> 2:51:02.740\n but wasn't thought through properly, right?\n\n2:51:02.740 --> 2:51:04.540\n And that's where you had like 14 days\n\n2:51:04.540 --> 2:51:05.380\n or something like that.\n\n2:51:05.380 --> 2:51:07.900\n 14 days, which is now we know is too long\n\n2:51:07.900 --> 2:51:11.580\n because you don't shed for that long in a normal infection.\n\n2:51:11.580 --> 2:51:14.120\n Now it's 10 days should be fine.\n\n2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:16.140\n So what happens is you get infected,\n\n2:51:16.140 --> 2:51:17.820\n you don't know it of course.\n\n2:51:17.820 --> 2:51:19.780\n The virus starts to grow very quickly.\n\n2:51:19.780 --> 2:51:21.900\n And within four or five days,\n\n2:51:21.900 --> 2:51:24.660\n you reach a peak of shedding.\n\n2:51:24.660 --> 2:51:28.220\n You're making a lot of RNA and you may be asymptomatic.\n\n2:51:28.220 --> 2:51:30.040\n You're shedding, you can infect others.\n\n2:51:30.040 --> 2:51:32.820\n And then you may or may not have your symptom onset.\n\n2:51:33.940 --> 2:51:36.240\n So you shed for a couple of days before symptom onset.\n\n2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:38.620\n And then within three days, four days,\n\n2:51:38.620 --> 2:51:41.460\n the viral RNA crashes and you're no longer shedding,\n\n2:51:41.460 --> 2:51:42.940\n you're no longer transmitting.\n\n2:51:42.940 --> 2:51:44.540\n So that's the one kind of test we have.\n\n2:51:44.540 --> 2:51:47.640\n It can tell you if you're infected at the moment,\n\n2:51:47.640 --> 2:51:49.020\n but it won't tell you\n\n2:51:49.020 --> 2:51:51.460\n if you're gonna be infected tomorrow, right?\n\n2:51:51.460 --> 2:51:52.660\n Cause if you're negative today,\n\n2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:54.020\n you could be positive tomorrow.\n\n2:51:54.020 --> 2:51:56.140\n You just might be in a different part\n\n2:51:56.140 --> 2:51:58.300\n of the incubation period, right?\n\n2:51:58.300 --> 2:52:01.060\n So that's one test been used the most.\n\n2:52:01.060 --> 2:52:05.020\n You can now get 15 minute versions of them\n\n2:52:05.020 --> 2:52:06.860\n in a walk in or whatever fine.\n\n2:52:06.860 --> 2:52:08.040\n Then there are antigen tests,\n\n2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:11.620\n which look for the proteins that the virus is making.\n\n2:52:11.620 --> 2:52:13.440\n So as it's reproducing in your nose,\n\n2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:16.140\n it's not only making genomes, it's making proteins.\n\n2:52:16.140 --> 2:52:18.340\n And so these you can buy in the drug store.\n\n2:52:18.340 --> 2:52:22.140\n And these would have been great if they had,\n\n2:52:22.140 --> 2:52:24.300\n Michael Minna last year had the idea\n\n2:52:24.300 --> 2:52:26.460\n that if we could make a little stick,\n\n2:52:26.460 --> 2:52:28.580\n a little piece of paper that you would suck on\n\n2:52:28.580 --> 2:52:30.340\n and it would tell you if you're infected or not,\n\n2:52:30.340 --> 2:52:32.540\n if this could cost less than a buck,\n\n2:52:32.540 --> 2:52:33.980\n everybody could test themselves.\n\n2:52:33.980 --> 2:52:37.020\n Which they can cost less than a buck, by the way.\n\n2:52:37.020 --> 2:52:38.820\n Yeah, but they were never made, right?\n\n2:52:38.820 --> 2:52:42.300\n Right, they're never mass manufactured.\n\n2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:44.740\n So his idea is to do like daily tests.\n\n2:52:44.740 --> 2:52:47.340\n Yeah, daily and then the kid's going to school,\n\n2:52:47.340 --> 2:52:49.860\n he's positive or she's positive.\n\n2:52:49.860 --> 2:52:51.820\n Well, if it's cheap enough, you just take another test\n\n2:52:51.820 --> 2:52:53.540\n because they have a certain error frequency.\n\n2:52:53.540 --> 2:52:55.300\n If it's positive twice, you stay home\n\n2:52:55.300 --> 2:52:57.180\n and the next day you try again.\n\n2:52:57.180 --> 2:52:59.860\n And I think this would have revolutionized\n\n2:52:59.860 --> 2:53:02.460\n because the PCR tests are more expensive at the time\n\n2:53:02.460 --> 2:53:05.320\n and they take longer to do and so forth.\n\n2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.060\n But that never happened.\n\n2:53:07.060 --> 2:53:09.500\n But now we do have $20 Binax now\n\n2:53:09.500 --> 2:53:12.420\n and others that you can buy and people buy them.\n\n2:53:12.420 --> 2:53:13.980\n But that can still happen, right?\n\n2:53:13.980 --> 2:53:16.020\n And this is the very frustrating thing to me\n\n2:53:16.020 --> 2:53:18.980\n because I'm worried about variants,\n\n2:53:18.980 --> 2:53:20.660\n but I'm also worried about future,\n\n2:53:20.660 --> 2:53:23.600\n much more deadly pandemics.\n\n2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:28.460\n Like I know we kind of said, yes, COVID, lots of deaths,\n\n2:53:28.460 --> 2:53:31.380\n but like it could be a lot worse too.\n\n2:53:31.380 --> 2:53:35.780\n And so I'm thinking what is going to be the right response\n\n2:53:35.780 --> 2:53:38.580\n for the future pandemic of its kind?\n\n2:53:38.580 --> 2:53:39.900\n And what's the right response\n\n2:53:39.900 --> 2:53:41.640\n for continued number of variants\n\n2:53:41.640 --> 2:53:44.620\n and some of the variants might be deadlier\n\n2:53:44.620 --> 2:53:45.940\n or more transmissible?\n\n2:53:45.940 --> 2:53:49.980\n Well, we can, the antigen tests\n\n2:53:49.980 --> 2:53:51.860\n will pick up the variants.\n\n2:53:51.860 --> 2:53:52.700\n That's not a question.\n\n2:53:52.700 --> 2:53:55.100\n The PCR may be influenced by changes,\n\n2:53:55.100 --> 2:53:58.500\n but you can quickly adapt the primers that you use.\n\n2:53:58.500 --> 2:53:59.340\n So that's what I mean.\n\n2:53:59.340 --> 2:54:00.980\n Like to me, all of these discussions\n\n2:54:00.980 --> 2:54:03.300\n about vaccines and so on.\n\n2:54:03.300 --> 2:54:06.800\n Vaccines, we got very lucky that they took so little time.\n\n2:54:08.060 --> 2:54:10.540\n And you have to be aware no matter what\n\n2:54:10.540 --> 2:54:12.340\n that there's hesitancy with the vaccines\n\n2:54:12.340 --> 2:54:13.780\n in this country before.\n\n2:54:13.780 --> 2:54:15.700\n I mean, yeah, that's a reality.\n\n2:54:15.700 --> 2:54:17.580\n You can't just be like magically saying\n\n2:54:17.580 --> 2:54:20.420\n that you're going to overcome that.\n\n2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:22.200\n And I don't think there's any hesitancy\n\n2:54:22.200 --> 2:54:24.040\n and cheap tests at home.\n\n2:54:24.040 --> 2:54:24.880\n I agree.\n\n2:54:24.880 --> 2:54:27.020\n I think if someone, so the question is\n\n2:54:27.020 --> 2:54:29.220\n if someone tested positive, would they stay home?\n\n2:54:29.220 --> 2:54:30.060\n That's the question.\n\n2:54:30.060 --> 2:54:32.380\n What if their job depends on them going in?\n\n2:54:32.380 --> 2:54:33.580\n I mean, that's.\n\n2:54:33.580 --> 2:54:36.660\n Well, you have to look at sort of aggregate,\n\n2:54:36.660 --> 2:54:38.180\n how many people would decide.\n\n2:54:38.180 --> 2:54:43.060\n And I think, again, a lot of that is in leadership,\n\n2:54:43.060 --> 2:54:45.060\n but I think a lot of them,\n\n2:54:45.060 --> 2:54:47.140\n I would say most people would stay home.\n\n2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:49.460\n I think that Mina had the idea\n\n2:54:49.460 --> 2:54:53.180\n and it would have changed the whole situation for sure.\n\n2:54:53.180 --> 2:54:56.220\n If it could have been made when we talked to him last spring,\n\n2:54:56.220 --> 2:54:59.900\n I think, or summer, we would have gotten around\n\n2:54:59.900 --> 2:55:01.540\n a lot of the issues that we're in today\n\n2:55:01.540 --> 2:55:03.060\n because I think people would have stayed home\n\n2:55:03.060 --> 2:55:04.000\n and not transmitted.\n\n2:55:04.000 --> 2:55:06.060\n And I think it's still valuable to this day.\n\n2:55:06.060 --> 2:55:09.820\n In the fall, if we don't have vaccine uptake,\n\n2:55:09.820 --> 2:55:12.380\n we could just test kids every day\n\n2:55:12.380 --> 2:55:14.240\n and keep them home when they're infected.\n\n2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:17.580\n It cuts, and we don't have it.\n\n2:55:17.580 --> 2:55:20.620\n But I think, and I'm not privy to what was going on,\n\n2:55:20.620 --> 2:55:22.980\n but I don't think a lot of emphasis\n\n2:55:22.980 --> 2:55:25.100\n was put on testing early on.\n\n2:55:25.100 --> 2:55:27.940\n The CDC developed the first one, it was flawed.\n\n2:55:27.940 --> 2:55:29.380\n They had to recall the kits.\n\n2:55:29.380 --> 2:55:30.380\n I mean, that's a fiasco.\n\n2:55:30.380 --> 2:55:32.200\n They should have had 100 companies\n\n2:55:32.200 --> 2:55:34.700\n making the tests initially, right?\n\n2:55:34.700 --> 2:55:37.960\n So for the future, I think what we have learned\n\n2:55:37.960 --> 2:55:42.280\n is we need to have a rapid antigen test right off the bat.\n\n2:55:42.280 --> 2:55:43.700\n It's doable.\n\n2:55:43.700 --> 2:55:46.220\n You can't do it in a day like you can for PCR\n\n2:55:46.220 --> 2:55:49.700\n because you need to make antibodies\n\n2:55:49.700 --> 2:55:51.180\n to the protein that you're looking for\n\n2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:52.920\n and you need to do those in animals.\n\n2:55:52.920 --> 2:55:57.660\n But you can do it in weeks and we should be ready for that.\n\n2:55:57.660 --> 2:56:00.680\n Yeah, because I mean, to me, that's obvious.\n\n2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:02.820\n That's obviously the best solution.\n\n2:56:02.820 --> 2:56:06.860\n Second to that, if we understood how well masks work.\n\n2:56:08.500 --> 2:56:11.300\n Like, maybe let me ask you this question.\n\n2:56:11.300 --> 2:56:13.020\n Let's put masks aside.\n\n2:56:14.040 --> 2:56:18.100\n How well do we understand how COVID is transmitted?\n\n2:56:18.100 --> 2:56:21.000\n There's droplets of different sizes,\n\n2:56:22.140 --> 2:56:24.820\n aerosols, tiny, tiny droplets.\n\n2:56:26.500 --> 2:56:28.480\n It seems like that's a very difficult thing\n\n2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:29.840\n to understand thoroughly.\n\n2:56:29.840 --> 2:56:33.320\n So it seems like it's transmitted both ways.\n\n2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:35.640\n It's unclear how exactly.\n\n2:56:35.640 --> 2:56:38.480\n So how much do we understand\n\n2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:40.680\n and why is it so difficult to understand fully?\n\n2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:43.080\n Well, I think it's clear that it's transmitted\n\n2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:44.760\n through the air mostly.\n\n2:56:44.760 --> 2:56:46.240\n It's not touching.\n\n2:56:46.240 --> 2:56:47.920\n We thought initially it would be a lot of touch,\n\n2:56:47.920 --> 2:56:50.040\n but very little of that.\n\n2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:53.120\n It's through the air and when you talk,\n\n2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:56.640\n mainly when you talk, you expel a lot of droplets, right?\n\n2:56:56.640 --> 2:56:59.240\n Even the plosives that your foam thing here\n\n2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:01.560\n are meant to pee, right?\n\n2:57:01.560 --> 2:57:03.040\n That you send out little sprays\n\n2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:04.640\n and those have viruses in them.\n\n2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:07.320\n And the big drops fall to the ground\n\n2:57:08.200 --> 2:57:11.280\n and the little ones can go 100 feet or more, right?\n\n2:57:11.280 --> 2:57:14.120\n But the little ones also have less virus in them.\n\n2:57:15.720 --> 2:57:18.720\n So I'm not sure, well, we certainly do not know\n\n2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:21.360\n how much virus you need to be infected.\n\n2:57:21.360 --> 2:57:24.920\n But it's probably at least several thousand particles,\n\n2:57:24.920 --> 2:57:26.160\n if not more.\n\n2:57:26.160 --> 2:57:29.480\n And it could be that for most people,\n\n2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:32.720\n the tiny droplets don't have enough virus\n\n2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:34.200\n to infect someone else.\n\n2:57:34.200 --> 2:57:37.080\n But there's one observation about this virus\n\n2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:38.640\n that's really interesting.\n\n2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:42.080\n And that is that 80% of transmissions\n\n2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:46.360\n are done by 20% of the people, of the infected people.\n\n2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:49.840\n Not every infected person transmits.\n\n2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:51.920\n That's been borne out in multiple studies.\n\n2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:55.520\n And in fact, there's a study at University of Colorado\n\n2:57:55.520 --> 2:57:58.720\n where they quantified the viral RNA loads\n\n2:57:58.720 --> 2:58:01.320\n in all the swabs that had been done of students\n\n2:58:01.320 --> 2:58:03.760\n for like a six month period.\n\n2:58:03.760 --> 2:58:07.880\n And most of the infectious virus,\n\n2:58:07.880 --> 2:58:10.680\n most of the RNA copies were found\n\n2:58:10.680 --> 2:58:14.600\n in 15 to 20% of the people.\n\n2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:15.760\n The rest had really low\n\n2:58:15.760 --> 2:58:18.320\n and that's probably why they don't transmit.\n\n2:58:18.320 --> 2:58:22.320\n So those are the ones that might get enough virus\n\n2:58:22.320 --> 2:58:24.840\n in the tiny droplets to be able to infect\n\n2:58:24.840 --> 2:58:26.520\n someone at a distance.\n\n2:58:26.520 --> 2:58:28.840\n And I think that's entirely possible.\n\n2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:31.040\n Why is it hard to study?\n\n2:58:31.040 --> 2:58:32.800\n You can't do it in real life\n\n2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:35.360\n because you don't know who's infected.\n\n2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:37.800\n And if you do, there's not a controlled environment\n\n2:58:37.800 --> 2:58:39.240\n to measure droplets and so forth.\n\n2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:42.280\n You'd have to do it in a laboratory situation.\n\n2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:44.160\n If you use an animal, you just don't know\n\n2:58:44.160 --> 2:58:46.520\n what the relevance of that is to people.\n\n2:58:46.520 --> 2:58:50.000\n You'd have to use human and do challenge experiments.\n\n2:58:50.000 --> 2:58:51.880\n And we don't do that at this point,\n\n2:58:51.880 --> 2:58:53.320\n at least not for this virus.\n\n2:58:53.320 --> 2:58:55.920\n So that's why it's hard to know what's going on.\n\n2:58:55.920 --> 2:58:58.240\n So we have to make inferences\n\n2:58:58.240 --> 2:59:01.240\n from epidemiological associations\n\n2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:03.840\n where you're studying, say transmission in a household\n\n2:59:03.840 --> 2:59:06.080\n where people are stuck in the same rooms together\n\n2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:09.160\n and you can get an idea of what kind of droplets\n\n2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:10.000\n were involved.\n\n2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:11.320\n So that makes it much harder too.\n\n2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:14.160\n If you're leaning on epidemiological stuff\n\n2:59:14.160 --> 2:59:15.680\n as opposed to like biophysics\n\n2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:17.280\n or something like the mechanic.\n\n2:59:17.280 --> 2:59:18.320\n Very hard.\n\n2:59:18.320 --> 2:59:23.120\n So that makes it really hard to then develop solutions\n\n2:59:23.120 --> 2:59:26.600\n like masks, to ask the question, how well do masks work?\n\n2:59:26.600 --> 2:59:28.800\n Because then to answer that question,\n\n2:59:28.800 --> 2:59:32.280\n you can lean on epidemiological stuff again,\n\n2:59:32.280 --> 2:59:34.520\n like looking at populations that wear masks\n\n2:59:34.520 --> 2:59:36.560\n versus don't wear masks.\n\n2:59:36.560 --> 2:59:38.840\n As opposed to actually saying,\n\n2:59:40.320 --> 2:59:41.840\n like from an engineering perspective,\n\n2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:46.600\n like what kind of material and what kind of tightness\n\n2:59:46.600 --> 2:59:50.440\n by which amount decreases the viral load\n\n2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:52.480\n that's received on the other end.\n\n2:59:52.480 --> 2:59:55.800\n But some experiments have been done with masks\n\n2:59:55.800 --> 2:59:58.680\n and just droplets with no virus in them, right?\n\n2:59:58.680 --> 3:00:01.360\n And you can measure the efficiency\n\n3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:04.400\n of different mask materials at keeping those in.\n\n3:00:04.400 --> 3:00:09.400\n So if I say that this mask stops 70%\n\n3:00:09.880 --> 3:00:13.760\n of this or larger size droplet,\n\n3:00:13.760 --> 3:00:18.000\n that leads to this percent decreased transmission.\n\n3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:23.000\n And also on both the generation\n\n3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:27.520\n and the receiving end and the giving end.\n\n3:00:27.520 --> 3:00:28.360\n Sure.\n\n3:00:28.360 --> 3:00:30.560\n So how well do masks protect you from others?\n\n3:00:30.560 --> 3:00:34.200\n How well do you do mask protect others from you?\n\n3:00:34.200 --> 3:00:36.920\n Like all of those things seem like\n\n3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:40.120\n they could be more rigorously studied.\n\n3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:41.560\n There's no doubt about it.\n\n3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:46.120\n And now is the time because once this is over,\n\n3:00:46.120 --> 3:00:47.200\n nobody's gonna do it.\n\n3:00:47.200 --> 3:00:48.360\n Nobody's gonna care.\n\n3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:49.200\n No. Right.\n\n3:00:49.200 --> 3:00:52.880\n But it seems like to me, so tests is one thing,\n\n3:00:52.880 --> 3:00:57.480\n but masks, like the good mask,\n\n3:00:57.480 --> 3:00:59.960\n whatever the good means, whatever that means,\n\n3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:04.200\n like some level of quality of material on your face,\n\n3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:08.960\n if it's shown to actually like thoroughly shown to work well,\n\n3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:10.960\n that seems like an obvious solution\n\n3:01:12.120 --> 3:01:14.840\n to reopen society with.\n\n3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:17.920\n If you have a good understanding of how well they work.\n\n3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:20.040\n Because if you don't have a good understanding,\n\n3:01:20.040 --> 3:01:21.800\n if there's a lot of uncertainty,\n\n3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:23.000\n that's when you get,\n\n3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:24.960\n and you have people speaking from authority,\n\n3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:27.960\n that's when you start getting the politicization\n\n3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:28.800\n of the solution.\n\n3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:29.640\n Of course, of course.\n\n3:01:29.640 --> 3:01:32.160\n No, the data, there are some data,\n\n3:01:33.200 --> 3:01:36.320\n most, they're mostly epidemiological\n\n3:01:36.320 --> 3:01:39.120\n and they show some effect in some countries, right?\n\n3:01:39.120 --> 3:01:40.800\n But they could be way better.\n\n3:01:40.800 --> 3:01:41.640\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:41.640 --> 3:01:44.920\n And, but the fact that they're not perfect,\n\n3:01:44.920 --> 3:01:46.800\n then people take advantage of and say,\n\n3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:48.120\n well, look, they don't work that well,\n\n3:01:48.120 --> 3:01:49.120\n so I'm not gonna wear it.\n\n3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:53.040\n I think, as you said, people can use it as an excuse.\n\n3:01:53.040 --> 3:01:56.200\n But even if it works, so Daniel always says,\n\n3:01:56.200 --> 3:02:00.680\n a mask will cut down transmission by 50 to 60%,\n\n3:02:00.680 --> 3:02:03.480\n and then distance will do another 30%.\n\n3:02:03.480 --> 3:02:05.800\n Yeah, those numbers are made up though.\n\n3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:08.360\n I mean, they're not made up, but they're estimates.\n\n3:02:08.360 --> 3:02:09.200\n Absolutely.\n\n3:02:09.200 --> 3:02:12.720\n And many of them are made based on models, right?\n\n3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:13.560\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:13.560 --> 3:02:14.400\n We make this model,\n\n3:02:14.400 --> 3:02:16.480\n and let's say the mask cuts down this much,\n\n3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:17.920\n what will be the effect on it?\n\n3:02:17.920 --> 3:02:19.000\n I mean, yeah, they're models,\n\n3:02:19.000 --> 3:02:20.760\n and it's for the same reason.\n\n3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:25.000\n I don't believe the transmission of the variants\n\n3:02:25.000 --> 3:02:27.280\n because it's all based on statistical models as well,\n\n3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:29.520\n not biological experiments done in a lab.\n\n3:02:29.520 --> 3:02:32.000\n So in that sense, vaccine data is much better\n\n3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.200\n than mask data.\n\n3:02:33.200 --> 3:02:34.480\n For sure, for sure.\n\n3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:37.160\n So my problem with the mask data,\n\n3:02:37.160 --> 3:02:38.440\n which I always thought was fascinating,\n\n3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:39.600\n I stopped talking about it.\n\n3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:41.400\n I was in a paper about masks.\n\n3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:42.400\n I stopped talking about it\n\n3:02:42.400 --> 3:02:45.080\n because what started happening\n\n3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:48.000\n is masks created assholes on both sides.\n\n3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:50.400\n The people that were like in Silicon Valley,\n\n3:02:50.400 --> 3:02:52.520\n the friends of mine that were wearing masks,\n\n3:02:52.520 --> 3:02:56.160\n the way they look at others who don't is like...\n\n3:02:56.160 --> 3:02:58.240\n Well, that's a whole nother issue, right?\n\n3:02:58.240 --> 3:02:59.880\n Yeah, I understand.\n\n3:02:59.880 --> 3:03:02.560\n That happens when you don't have solid science.\n\n3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:03.400\n Understood.\n\n3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:07.240\n They now start judging you like you're a lesser human being.\n\n3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:11.520\n You're not only dumb, but you're almost like evil.\n\n3:03:11.520 --> 3:03:14.280\n You're doing bad for society by not wearing a mask.\n\n3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:17.120\n And then the people looking in the other way\n\n3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:19.800\n are seeing you for the asshole that you're being\n\n3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:22.040\n for judging them unrightly.\n\n3:03:22.040 --> 3:03:24.480\n So they almost wanna say F you by not wearing the mask.\n\n3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:26.640\n And there's this division that's created\n\n3:03:26.640 --> 3:03:30.400\n that was heartbreaking to me because masks like testing\n\n3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:33.400\n is a solution that was available early on.\n\n3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:35.920\n And if understood well, it could be deployed\n\n3:03:35.920 --> 3:03:37.880\n in a mass scale, and it seems like there's\n\n3:03:37.880 --> 3:03:40.120\n some historical evidence for other viruses\n\n3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:41.760\n where it does very well.\n\n3:03:41.760 --> 3:03:42.600\n That's correct.\n\n3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:45.720\n And so like the fact that this was politicized,\n\n3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:48.760\n yeah, it was a little bit heartbreaking.\n\n3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:51.800\n You can find in the literature studies,\n\n3:03:51.800 --> 3:03:54.560\n mostly of healthcare workers and influenza,\n\n3:03:54.560 --> 3:03:56.240\n where you can actually,\n\n3:03:56.240 --> 3:03:58.440\n because you see the people every day that can sample them,\n\n3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:00.520\n you can actually see what masking does.\n\n3:04:00.520 --> 3:04:04.040\n And some of them show an effect and others do not,\n\n3:04:04.040 --> 3:04:05.600\n then that's the problem.\n\n3:04:05.600 --> 3:04:08.280\n Like any trial, sometimes if it's not big enough\n\n3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:10.360\n and then people latch onto that, see,\n\n3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:11.600\n it doesn't really work.\n\n3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:15.000\n But I think the main issue is that in January,\n\n3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:20.000\n both CDC and WHO said masks don't work, don't use them.\n\n3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:22.240\n That was the kiss of death for masks\n\n3:04:22.240 --> 3:04:25.080\n because when they then changed their mind,\n\n3:04:25.920 --> 3:04:28.040\n they didn't say we screwed up.\n\n3:04:28.040 --> 3:04:29.240\n They just said wear masks.\n\n3:04:29.240 --> 3:04:33.000\n If they had said we made a mistake, we were wrong,\n\n3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.400\n I think more people would have worn masks.\n\n3:04:35.400 --> 3:04:36.600\n But they didn't.\n\n3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:39.080\n And like you said, admitting you're wrong\n\n3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:41.440\n is like a real big part of it.\n\n3:04:41.440 --> 3:04:43.200\n And I also think almost the better way\n\n3:04:43.200 --> 3:04:46.560\n is not just saying you're wrong,\n\n3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:49.760\n but in January saying,\n\n3:04:49.760 --> 3:04:52.360\n like revealing the uncertainty under which we operate.\n\n3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:56.440\n Like actually, like reveal what was done\n\n3:04:56.440 --> 3:04:58.360\n with the Spanish flu at the beginning\n\n3:04:58.360 --> 3:04:59.680\n of the previous century,\n\n3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:03.240\n because there's a lot of mass controversy then too.\n\n3:05:03.240 --> 3:05:04.120\n It went back and forth.\n\n3:05:04.120 --> 3:05:05.960\n And that was actually the source of a lot of distrust\n\n3:05:05.960 --> 3:05:06.920\n there too.\n\n3:05:06.920 --> 3:05:09.280\n So, and then look at influenza,\n\n3:05:09.280 --> 3:05:11.080\n like how is it effective with that?\n\n3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:13.880\n And just reveal this, we don't know,\n\n3:05:13.880 --> 3:05:17.680\n but like with some probability,\n\n3:05:17.680 --> 3:05:20.120\n this is the best option we got currently.\n\n3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:23.600\n And then in a month or two, adjust it,\n\n3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:25.280\n saying that, you know what,\n\n3:05:25.280 --> 3:05:27.840\n our like uncertainty decreased a little bit.\n\n3:05:27.840 --> 3:05:29.440\n We have a better idea.\n\n3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:32.320\n Like that was an incorrect estimate,\n\n3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:34.840\n but reveal that you're struggling.\n\n3:05:34.840 --> 3:05:36.840\n It's not like this weird binary clock\n\n3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:38.440\n that goes one direction or the other.\n\n3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:41.200\n You're struggling with uncertainty.\n\n3:05:41.200 --> 3:05:42.400\n And like trusting,\n\n3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:45.040\n people maybe criticize me sometimes for this,\n\n3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:48.000\n but I think most people are actually intelligent.\n\n3:05:48.960 --> 3:05:51.760\n Like trusting the public to be intelligent\n\n3:05:51.760 --> 3:05:54.040\n with if you give them, if you have transparent\n\n3:05:54.040 --> 3:05:57.680\n and give them information in a real authentic way,\n\n3:05:57.680 --> 3:05:59.560\n like don't look like you're hiding something.\n\n3:05:59.560 --> 3:06:01.920\n I think they're intelligent enough to use that data\n\n3:06:01.920 --> 3:06:03.120\n to make decisions.\n\n3:06:03.120 --> 3:06:05.080\n It's the same thing as with the testing,\n\n3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:07.600\n is if you put that power in the people's hands\n\n3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:08.640\n to know if they're sick or not,\n\n3:06:08.640 --> 3:06:12.240\n they're gonna make unmasked the right decision, I think.\n\n3:06:14.240 --> 3:06:17.080\n The masks and the testing has been a bit heartbreaking.\n\n3:06:18.000 --> 3:06:19.440\n I think that's a good point though,\n\n3:06:19.440 --> 3:06:21.640\n that most people don't seem to have an objection\n\n3:06:21.640 --> 3:06:23.040\n to testing.\n\n3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:23.880\n It's a good point.\n\n3:06:23.880 --> 3:06:24.720\n Yes. Yeah.\n\n3:06:24.720 --> 3:06:27.960\n And then obviously Macamina makes that point brilliantly.\n\n3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:32.080\n And still there's very little excitement around that.\n\n3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:35.000\n But he said he was going to do it.\n\n3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:35.840\n I don't understand.\n\n3:06:35.840 --> 3:06:37.600\n I mean, I haven't spoken to him since then.\n\n3:06:37.600 --> 3:06:38.720\n So I don't know why.\n\n3:06:38.720 --> 3:06:39.560\n He's pushing it.\n\n3:06:39.560 --> 3:06:41.640\n Well, I mean, but he can't do it alone.\n\n3:06:41.640 --> 3:06:44.680\n He has to get, so one of the resistances,\n\n3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:48.160\n FDA doesn't like cheap things.\n\n3:06:48.160 --> 3:06:49.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:06:49.120 --> 3:06:50.240\n They don't wanna approve it.\n\n3:06:50.240 --> 3:06:52.960\n So they makes the mass manufacture\n\n3:06:52.960 --> 3:06:55.120\n like with the emergency exceptions,\n\n3:06:55.120 --> 3:06:57.440\n all those kinds of things very difficult.\n\n3:06:57.440 --> 3:06:59.560\n And then there's not much money to be made on it\n\n3:06:59.560 --> 3:07:00.760\n without that.\n\n3:07:00.760 --> 3:07:01.600\n I don't know.\n\n3:07:01.600 --> 3:07:04.840\n I think there's just economic pressures against it.\n\n3:07:04.840 --> 3:07:09.840\n And because so much investment was placed on the vaccines\n\n3:07:10.920 --> 3:07:13.360\n and obviously there's an incentive mechanism there\n\n3:07:13.360 --> 3:07:16.120\n where the companies, lobbyists and all those,\n\n3:07:17.200 --> 3:07:21.440\n there's this machine that says arguing for tests\n\n3:07:21.440 --> 3:07:23.240\n is difficult because the thing that's worked\n\n3:07:23.240 --> 3:07:27.160\n for most severe viruses in the past is vaccines.\n\n3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:28.320\n Now we have vaccines.\n\n3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:30.360\n Why the hell would you need tests?\n\n3:07:30.360 --> 3:07:34.440\n At that time, like why the hell do you need tests\n\n3:07:34.440 --> 3:07:36.080\n when we can be working on vaccines?\n\n3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:37.720\n It seems like the obvious thing to be working\n\n3:07:37.720 --> 3:07:40.680\n is the vaccines from their perspective,\n\n3:07:40.680 --> 3:07:43.160\n but it's not obvious at all to me.\n\n3:07:43.160 --> 3:07:44.440\n I think you should have both.\n\n3:07:44.440 --> 3:07:46.600\n I think have vaccines and good testing\n\n3:07:46.600 --> 3:07:48.920\n and that covers you really well\n\n3:07:48.920 --> 3:07:50.080\n because you're always gonna have people\n\n3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:52.080\n who don't get vaccinated.\n\n3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:54.200\n I don't know if you've been paying attention to this.\n\n3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:55.720\n There's a guy named Brett Weinstein.\n\n3:07:55.720 --> 3:07:57.760\n There's a guy named Sam Harris.\n\n3:07:57.760 --> 3:07:59.560\n They have good representation.\n\n3:08:00.760 --> 3:08:05.760\n I would say of two sides of a perspective on the vaccine.\n\n3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:09.680\n So from Sam Harris's perspective,\n\n3:08:09.680 --> 3:08:13.240\n it's obvious that everybody should get vaccinated\n\n3:08:13.240 --> 3:08:18.240\n and it's irresponsible to not get vaccinated.\n\n3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:22.360\n I think he represents a lot of people's belief in that.\n\n3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:27.360\n And then Brett talks a lot about ivermectin,\n\n3:08:28.520 --> 3:08:32.720\n but also talks about hesitancy towards the vaccine\n\n3:08:32.720 --> 3:08:35.040\n for people who are healthy,\n\n3:08:35.040 --> 3:08:37.520\n for people who are younger, that kind of thing,\n\n3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:40.840\n and saying we should consider longterm effects\n\n3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:45.200\n of the vaccine in making this calculation.\n\n3:08:45.200 --> 3:08:47.520\n What do you make about this conversation?\n\n3:08:47.520 --> 3:08:49.400\n Some of it happens on Twitter.\n\n3:08:49.400 --> 3:08:52.480\n Some of it happens in the space of podcasts.\n\n3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.240\n Do you pay attention to this kind of thing?\n\n3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:58.240\n What's your role in this?\n\n3:08:58.240 --> 3:09:02.080\n What do you hope is the way to resolve this conversation?\n\n3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:04.040\n Do you think it's healthy?\n\n3:09:04.040 --> 3:09:05.760\n Well, a conversation is always healthy,\n\n3:09:05.760 --> 3:09:09.280\n but to make definitive statements is not\n\n3:09:09.280 --> 3:09:12.200\n because it suggests you have information that you don't have.\n\n3:09:12.200 --> 3:09:16.880\n So we talked about longterm effects.\n\n3:09:16.880 --> 3:09:20.360\n I think you need to balance those versus longterm effects\n\n3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:22.520\n of the disease and you can make your decision.\n\n3:09:22.520 --> 3:09:26.560\n I don't think you need to tell everybody to get vaccinated.\n\n3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:28.760\n I think you need to present the case.\n\n3:09:28.760 --> 3:09:30.400\n You say, here, we made good vaccines.\n\n3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:32.240\n Here are the safety profile.\n\n3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:34.400\n Here's the risk benefit balance.\n\n3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:35.280\n And you should decide.\n\n3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:36.160\n You're a smart person.\n\n3:09:36.160 --> 3:09:37.880\n You should decide.\n\n3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:41.240\n Now, companies are gonna do differently, right?\n\n3:09:41.240 --> 3:09:43.320\n Companies may say you have to be vaccinated to work here.\n\n3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:46.720\n My employer, Columbia, said we have to be vaccinated\n\n3:09:46.720 --> 3:09:47.560\n to work in the fall.\n\n3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:49.440\n And if you wanna be a student, you have to be vaccinated.\n\n3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:52.240\n So you decide whether you wanna go or not.\n\n3:09:52.240 --> 3:09:57.240\n But the idea that you should make a decision\n\n3:09:58.000 --> 3:10:02.480\n based on longterm effects, there is no evidence, right?\n\n3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:03.760\n So how can you make a decision\n\n3:10:03.760 --> 3:10:05.200\n when we don't have evidence,\n\n3:10:05.200 --> 3:10:06.280\n whereas we do have evidence\n\n3:10:06.280 --> 3:10:08.440\n that there are longterm effects of getting COVID?\n\n3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:10.200\n So I don't think that's a fair argument\n\n3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:13.640\n and it just makes people scared to say that.\n\n3:10:13.640 --> 3:10:15.000\n But on the other hand, for someone to say\n\n3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:18.280\n it's a no brainer and to denigrate people\n\n3:10:18.280 --> 3:10:20.400\n for not being vaccinated, that's not the approach either\n\n3:10:20.400 --> 3:10:23.320\n because they're gonna dig in and say,\n\n3:10:23.320 --> 3:10:25.680\n I'm not doing this because you tell me to, right?\n\n3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:28.600\n I think the middle ground is to say,\n\n3:10:28.600 --> 3:10:33.600\n take a bit of both and say, here are the potential issues\n\n3:10:33.600 --> 3:10:37.280\n and here are the benefits and this is what I would do.\n\n3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:38.680\n And you have to just decide on your own.\n\n3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:39.520\n I'd leave it to them.\n\n3:10:39.520 --> 3:10:40.360\n I say, you decide.\n\n3:10:40.360 --> 3:10:42.280\n And if you don't want to, it's up to you.\n\n3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:44.480\n You don't have to get vaccinated.\n\n3:10:44.480 --> 3:10:46.360\n And you'll probably get infected at some point\n\n3:10:46.360 --> 3:10:47.760\n and maybe you'll be okay.\n\n3:10:50.040 --> 3:10:51.640\n But here's the best available data\n\n3:10:51.640 --> 3:10:56.640\n and it looks like the vaccines are pretty damn smart solution.\n\n3:10:56.760 --> 3:10:57.600\n They seem to work.\n\n3:10:57.600 --> 3:11:00.000\n I think you tell people what you did\n\n3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:01.880\n and present both sides calmly.\n\n3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:04.720\n And I think digging in, like in a debate,\n\n3:11:04.720 --> 3:11:06.920\n I don't think that's terribly useful.\n\n3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:08.920\n So that's my view.\n\n3:11:08.920 --> 3:11:11.440\n I mean, people come to me all the time and ask me,\n\n3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:14.680\n I'm worried, what should I do?\n\n3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:16.120\n And I say, what are you worried about?\n\n3:11:16.120 --> 3:11:18.960\n Let's talk about it and go through it calmly.\n\n3:11:18.960 --> 3:11:20.720\n And if they want to still take ivermectin,\n\n3:11:20.720 --> 3:11:22.640\n I say, it's fine, it's your choice.\n\n3:11:22.640 --> 3:11:23.480\n And I have a problem with that.\n\n3:11:23.480 --> 3:11:24.960\n I love that.\n\n3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:26.680\n I love that's the way you think.\n\n3:11:26.680 --> 3:11:30.320\n People should definitely listen to This Week in Virology\n\n3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:33.920\n and follow your work, it's brilliant.\n\n3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:35.760\n I've been really enjoying it lately.\n\n3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:38.320\n It's like, it's my favorite way to stay in touch\n\n3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:42.160\n with the happenings of COVID.\n\n3:11:42.160 --> 3:11:45.520\n Obviously you put in a lot of other stuff in there, but.\n\n3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:47.760\n We used to do other viruses before COVID.\n\n3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:49.120\n It was quite interesting.\n\n3:11:50.040 --> 3:11:52.520\n And I'm trying to slip other viruses in\n\n3:11:52.520 --> 3:11:56.120\n because I think they're informative in many ways.\n\n3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:57.280\n And we're gonna do more and more of that.\n\n3:11:57.280 --> 3:11:58.600\n But I have to say I canceled,\n\n3:11:58.600 --> 3:12:00.840\n usually I record on Tuesday and Friday\n\n3:12:00.840 --> 3:12:02.960\n and I canceled today so I could be with you.\n\n3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:05.040\n It's a huge honor, I appreciate that.\n\n3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:06.680\n No, no, it's fine.\n\n3:12:06.680 --> 3:12:10.240\n I think a couple of other people were gonna be away anyway.\n\n3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:12.040\n So I do a lot of different pods.\n\n3:12:12.040 --> 3:12:15.680\n They're all on YouTube, but I also do a live stream\n\n3:12:15.680 --> 3:12:18.480\n on Wednesday nights on YouTube, which you can find.\n\n3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:21.360\n And that's where people can come and ask questions.\n\n3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:22.440\n We don't have an agenda.\n\n3:12:22.440 --> 3:12:25.280\n We just start and by 30 minutes in,\n\n3:12:25.280 --> 3:12:27.440\n there's 700 people with questions\n\n3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:28.600\n that I can't even get through\n\n3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:29.600\n because there's so many of them.\n\n3:12:29.600 --> 3:12:31.720\n And I'm actually astounded\n\n3:12:31.720 --> 3:12:35.640\n that so many people have really good questions.\n\n3:12:35.640 --> 3:12:38.960\n Most of them are reasonable and they come back every week.\n\n3:12:38.960 --> 3:12:41.880\n So it's turning into a great forum\n\n3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:43.240\n to have a nice discussion.\n\n3:12:44.120 --> 3:12:46.920\n And the YouTube channel is called what?\n\n3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:48.960\n So you could search for my name,\n\n3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:51.280\n which is Vincent Racaniello, it'll turn up.\n\n3:12:51.280 --> 3:12:56.280\n Or my handle on YouTube is ProfVRR, P R O F V R R.\n\n3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:03.040\n Have you read The Plague by Camus by any chance?\n\n3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:05.800\n Years ago, years ago.\n\n3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:07.160\n I have to read it again.\n\n3:13:07.160 --> 3:13:08.720\n That's really relevant.\n\n3:13:08.720 --> 3:13:10.840\n Let me sort of ask you a question about it.\n\n3:13:10.840 --> 3:13:14.000\n It describes a town that's overtaken by a plague\n\n3:13:14.000 --> 3:13:16.480\n and it's blocked off from the rest of the world.\n\n3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:19.480\n And it kind of reveals the best, the worst of human nature.\n\n3:13:19.480 --> 3:13:21.240\n That's like how people respond to that.\n\n3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:25.120\n Sort of the encroaching, their own mortality,\n\n3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:27.240\n their own death on the horizon.\n\n3:13:27.240 --> 3:13:28.960\n I think one of the messages in the book\n\n3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:33.960\n that ultimately like love for others.\n\n3:13:34.160 --> 3:13:36.800\n So like a lot of people want to become isolated\n\n3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:38.440\n and they hide from each other,\n\n3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:42.040\n but ultimately the thing that saves you is love,\n\n3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:45.680\n which is one of the things of just watching this pandemic,\n\n3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:50.560\n with the distance, with the masks, that's all fine.\n\n3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:55.560\n But there's a distancing from people of that tension,\n\n3:13:55.560 --> 3:13:59.240\n the breaking of the common humanity between people.\n\n3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:02.280\n That's one of the reasons when I came to Austin\n\n3:14:02.280 --> 3:14:05.200\n earlier this year just to visit,\n\n3:14:05.200 --> 3:14:06.440\n I fell in love with the city\n\n3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:09.040\n because even with the masks and the distance,\n\n3:14:09.040 --> 3:14:14.040\n there was still a camaraderie, like, I don't know,\n\n3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:15.800\n just a love for each other,\n\n3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:18.040\n just a kindness towards each other.\n\n3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:20.840\n And that's why I took away from The Plague.\n\n3:14:20.840 --> 3:14:23.400\n Mostly it's told to the story of the doctor\n\n3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:27.000\n who basically gives in\n\n3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:30.480\n and just gives himself as a service to others.\n\n3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:33.000\n And that love is the thing that liberates him\n\n3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:34.680\n from his own conception of mortality,\n\n3:14:34.680 --> 3:14:37.920\n the fact that he's here, he's going to die.\n\n3:14:37.920 --> 3:14:41.760\n What do you think about the effect of the virus?\n\n3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:43.080\n We talked a lot about biology,\n\n3:14:43.080 --> 3:14:45.280\n but the effect of the virus\n\n3:14:45.280 --> 3:14:50.280\n on the fabric of the common humanity that connects us.\n\n3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:54.200\n Well, that's what a pandemic does.\n\n3:14:54.200 --> 3:14:56.280\n It really cuts that, right?\n\n3:14:56.280 --> 3:14:58.440\n Because small outbreaks, they're local,\n\n3:14:58.440 --> 3:15:00.880\n they don't have global effects.\n\n3:15:00.880 --> 3:15:03.080\n But when you have something this big\n\n3:15:03.080 --> 3:15:07.440\n where pretty much nobody escapes,\n\n3:15:07.440 --> 3:15:10.200\n and not just making people sick,\n\n3:15:10.200 --> 3:15:12.480\n it changes your life, right?\n\n3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:14.600\n People lose jobs, they change jobs,\n\n3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:16.120\n they move somewhere else.\n\n3:15:17.240 --> 3:15:20.000\n They have all kinds of disruptions.\n\n3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.080\n You know, kids can't go to school.\n\n3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:23.560\n It really shows you.\n\n3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:25.520\n I mean, I always like to say,\n\n3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:30.240\n a tiny virus can bring Earth to its knees.\n\n3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:31.920\n A tiny virus that you can't even see them,\n\n3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:35.240\n that most people don't even think about most of the time.\n\n3:15:35.240 --> 3:15:37.720\n And the real effect is not just sickness,\n\n3:15:37.720 --> 3:15:39.240\n it's what it does to people.\n\n3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:42.800\n Because in the end, we are animals,\n\n3:15:42.800 --> 3:15:46.040\n and most animals like each other, and they interact,\n\n3:15:46.040 --> 3:15:47.600\n they have great social structures,\n\n3:15:47.600 --> 3:15:49.960\n and that makes them do well.\n\n3:15:49.960 --> 3:15:53.320\n And I guess the exception is people in AI, right?\n\n3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:56.600\n They could be on their own.\n\n3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:57.840\n Well, that's why you build robots,\n\n3:15:57.840 --> 3:15:58.960\n that you fall in love with.\n\n3:15:58.960 --> 3:15:59.800\n That's right.\n\n3:15:59.800 --> 3:16:02.000\n And so I think when a,\n\n3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:06.040\n the real story is what it does to society, for sure.\n\n3:16:06.040 --> 3:16:08.640\n Which has ramifications way beyond\n\n3:16:08.640 --> 3:16:10.520\n the number of people dying,\n\n3:16:10.520 --> 3:16:12.720\n and the vaccines, and the tests, and all of that.\n\n3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:15.640\n And this one has really made a big rupture.\n\n3:16:15.640 --> 3:16:17.360\n And you could tell, not now so much,\n\n3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:18.680\n I think being out and about now,\n\n3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:21.080\n things look pretty normal,\n\n3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:23.760\n except for some people wearing masks.\n\n3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:25.000\n You would never know.\n\n3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:28.200\n I mean, the airport this morning was completely jammed.\n\n3:16:28.200 --> 3:16:29.680\n People going, and they're all on vacation,\n\n3:16:29.680 --> 3:16:31.480\n they're all wearing shorts, right?\n\n3:16:31.480 --> 3:16:32.960\n So they're back to normal.\n\n3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:34.320\n It's August.\n\n3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:36.800\n But last year is really different.\n\n3:16:36.800 --> 3:16:38.880\n In New York, where you're used\n\n3:16:38.880 --> 3:16:41.160\n to lots of people on the street, it was eerie.\n\n3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:43.040\n It was just quiet.\n\n3:16:43.040 --> 3:16:46.000\n But under it all, people are still,\n\n3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:49.000\n most people help each other when they have to, right?\n\n3:16:50.120 --> 3:16:52.320\n Most people are willing to,\n\n3:16:52.320 --> 3:16:53.640\n if something happens to someone,\n\n3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:55.320\n to reach out and help them.\n\n3:16:56.360 --> 3:16:58.840\n There are always exceptions where people are mean,\n\n3:16:58.840 --> 3:17:01.880\n and that's just the way animals are.\n\n3:17:01.880 --> 3:17:05.280\n We're not the only ones that can be mean to our own species.\n\n3:17:05.280 --> 3:17:08.680\n But I think most of the motivation\n\n3:17:08.680 --> 3:17:12.200\n for everything that was done is to help other people.\n\n3:17:12.200 --> 3:17:15.600\n I mean, I do think that the vaccine manufacturers,\n\n3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:18.120\n maybe not the leaders, but the people working in the labs\n\n3:17:18.120 --> 3:17:20.480\n really wanted to get this out quickly\n\n3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:22.720\n and help people, right?\n\n3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:26.320\n I think at every level, people who are contributing\n\n3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:27.920\n really wanted to help other people\n\n3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:30.160\n and feel proud that they're able to do that.\n\n3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:34.720\n So I view it as we're never gonna be 100% good\n\n3:17:35.640 --> 3:17:37.640\n because animals are not.\n\n3:17:37.640 --> 3:17:40.440\n Evolution made us, I mean, we're lucky.\n\n3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:43.480\n We somehow rose above by having incredible brain\n\n3:17:43.480 --> 3:17:45.520\n and so forth, but a lot of our base instincts\n\n3:17:45.520 --> 3:17:47.920\n are animals, and they chase each other\n\n3:17:47.920 --> 3:17:51.200\n and have alpha males and all that stuff,\n\n3:17:51.200 --> 3:17:53.440\n and we always have a little bit of that in us.\n\n3:17:53.440 --> 3:17:56.800\n But we do have some humanity\n\n3:17:56.800 --> 3:17:59.960\n that this really ripped up, it really did.\n\n3:18:00.960 --> 3:18:05.160\n And I think for me, someone who studied viruses\n\n3:18:05.160 --> 3:18:07.760\n for over 40 years, it's just amazing\n\n3:18:07.760 --> 3:18:11.240\n that an invisible thing can do that, right?\n\n3:18:11.240 --> 3:18:13.320\n It goes back to the thing you found fascinating,\n\n3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:15.200\n which is a virus affecting human behavior.\n\n3:18:15.200 --> 3:18:16.040\n Yes.\n\n3:18:16.040 --> 3:18:17.640\n Or behavior of the organism.\n\n3:18:18.680 --> 3:18:22.920\n Yes, so humans can make weapons and do harm\n\n3:18:22.920 --> 3:18:25.280\n and you can see that, but this you can't even see.\n\n3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:26.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:27.640\n You can't, and look what it has done.\n\n3:18:27.640 --> 3:18:29.720\n And it'll do it again, there'll be more.\n\n3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:32.800\n I just, I wish we would be more prepared\n\n3:18:32.800 --> 3:18:34.800\n because we know what to do.\n\n3:18:34.800 --> 3:18:38.120\n We know we should be making antivirals vaccines,\n\n3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:42.080\n masks, testing masks, making test modalities\n\n3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:45.280\n that we can really quickly redesign.\n\n3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:49.080\n But after SARS one, all that went out the door.\n\n3:18:49.080 --> 3:18:50.160\n People didn't do anything,\n\n3:18:50.160 --> 3:18:51.880\n and that's why we're in this situation.\n\n3:18:51.880 --> 3:18:54.840\n So people ask me this all the time,\n\n3:18:54.840 --> 3:18:57.800\n are we gonna be ready for the next one?\n\n3:18:57.800 --> 3:18:59.520\n And I always say, we should be.\n\n3:18:59.520 --> 3:19:03.000\n We have all the information we need to know what to do.\n\n3:19:03.000 --> 3:19:05.840\n But somehow I think people forget.\n\n3:19:05.840 --> 3:19:10.840\n That said, sometimes we really step up\n\n3:19:12.760 --> 3:19:14.840\n when the tragedies run in front of us.\n\n3:19:14.840 --> 3:19:15.680\n We do.\n\n3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:16.520\n When the catastrophe.\n\n3:19:16.520 --> 3:19:18.720\n So I don't know, somehow humans have still survived.\n\n3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:21.080\n The fact that we had nuclear weapons for so many decades\n\n3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:23.120\n and we still have not blown each other up,\n\n3:19:23.120 --> 3:19:27.520\n whether by terrorists or by nation is quite surprising.\n\n3:19:27.520 --> 3:19:30.640\n That's always, after reading the Pentagon Papers,\n\n3:19:30.640 --> 3:19:32.920\n it's even more amazing, right?\n\n3:19:32.920 --> 3:19:34.400\n So I don't know how we do it.\n\n3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:39.400\n I tend to believe there's that at the surface,\n\n3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:43.480\n you notice the greed, the corruption, the evil,\n\n3:19:43.480 --> 3:19:46.560\n but the core of human nature, the human spirit\n\n3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:50.840\n is one in the scientific realm is curiosity,\n\n3:19:50.840 --> 3:19:54.280\n and more deeply is kindness, compassion,\n\n3:19:54.280 --> 3:19:56.800\n and wanting to do good for the world.\n\n3:19:56.800 --> 3:20:00.160\n I believe that desire to do good outpowers\n\n3:20:00.160 --> 3:20:03.000\n all the other stuff by a large amount.\n\n3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:06.960\n And that's why we have not yet destroyed ourselves.\n\n3:20:06.960 --> 3:20:08.320\n There's a lot of bickering.\n\n3:20:08.320 --> 3:20:10.360\n There's a lot of wars on the surface,\n\n3:20:10.360 --> 3:20:11.520\n but underneath it all,\n\n3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:16.240\n there's this ocean of love for each other.\n\n3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:20.020\n I mean, I think there's an evolutionary advantage to that.\n\n3:20:21.280 --> 3:20:23.640\n And it would be a good explanation\n\n3:20:23.640 --> 3:20:25.440\n why we still haven't destroyed ourselves.\n\n3:20:25.440 --> 3:20:27.440\n God, we had so many opportunities.\n\n3:20:27.440 --> 3:20:29.840\n If you look at all the wars in history, so many.\n\n3:20:29.840 --> 3:20:33.360\n I was just, my son was telling me\n\n3:20:33.360 --> 3:20:35.880\n about the Ottoman Empire, right?\n\n3:20:35.880 --> 3:20:39.520\n I mean, it's just war after war,\n\n3:20:39.520 --> 3:20:42.120\n and then other countries splitting up countries\n\n3:20:42.120 --> 3:20:45.300\n with no regard to who's living where, right?\n\n3:20:46.560 --> 3:20:49.440\n It's just, how can these people do this?\n\n3:20:49.440 --> 3:20:50.840\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n3:20:50.840 --> 3:20:52.040\n Human history is fascinating,\n\n3:20:52.040 --> 3:20:54.600\n and we're still young as a species.\n\n3:20:54.600 --> 3:20:57.360\n We have a lot more time to go,\n\n3:20:57.360 --> 3:21:00.520\n and a lot more ways to destroy ourselves.\n\n3:21:00.520 --> 3:21:01.660\n Do you have advice?\n\n3:21:01.660 --> 3:21:03.880\n Like you said, you have many decades of research\n\n3:21:03.880 --> 3:21:06.400\n and an incredible career and life.\n\n3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:09.880\n Do you have advice for young people about career,\n\n3:21:09.880 --> 3:21:13.360\n about life, people in high school, people in college,\n\n3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:16.460\n of how to live a life they can be proud of?\n\n3:21:17.460 --> 3:21:20.000\n So what I like to do is tell people,\n\n3:21:20.000 --> 3:21:22.360\n don't plan it, because I didn't plan anything.\n\n3:21:22.360 --> 3:21:25.000\n Everything I did was one step at a time.\n\n3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:26.660\n You don't have to plan.\n\n3:21:26.660 --> 3:21:30.800\n I just found things that were interesting to me.\n\n3:21:30.800 --> 3:21:33.440\n And so my father was a doctor,\n\n3:21:33.440 --> 3:21:35.780\n and he wanted me to be a doctor,\n\n3:21:35.780 --> 3:21:39.040\n but I was not interested in taking care of people.\n\n3:21:39.040 --> 3:21:43.160\n I learned that, but I couldn't say no to him.\n\n3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:46.320\n So I was a biology major in college,\n\n3:21:46.320 --> 3:21:51.320\n and I graduated, and I didn't have anything to do.\n\n3:21:51.660 --> 3:21:54.800\n So I liked science, so I got a job in a lab.\n\n3:21:54.800 --> 3:21:57.720\n And it was very exciting,\n\n3:21:57.720 --> 3:22:00.680\n and that led to everything else\n\n3:22:00.680 --> 3:22:02.880\n that I've done one step at a time.\n\n3:22:02.880 --> 3:22:05.800\n And I think the most important thing you can do,\n\n3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:06.960\n well, there are two important things.\n\n3:22:06.960 --> 3:22:08.640\n You can be really curious all the time.\n\n3:22:08.640 --> 3:22:10.040\n You mentioned curiosity.\n\n3:22:10.040 --> 3:22:12.040\n I think curiosity is essential.\n\n3:22:12.980 --> 3:22:15.580\n You have to be curious about everything.\n\n3:22:15.580 --> 3:22:18.160\n And if you are, you're never gonna be bored.\n\n3:22:19.240 --> 3:22:20.920\n And so people who say they're bored,\n\n3:22:20.920 --> 3:22:22.520\n I say, you are not curious.\n\n3:22:22.520 --> 3:22:24.200\n You should just think about things\n\n3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:27.440\n and say, look at something and say, how does that work?\n\n3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:29.320\n Or what is it doing, and how do they get there?\n\n3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:30.480\n And you'll never be bored.\n\n3:22:30.480 --> 3:22:32.840\n And the other thing is when you find something,\n\n3:22:32.840 --> 3:22:35.340\n which may take time, it's fine.\n\n3:22:36.960 --> 3:22:38.540\n You have to be passionate about it.\n\n3:22:38.540 --> 3:22:40.860\n You have to put everything into it.\n\n3:22:40.860 --> 3:22:42.920\n And that's what I did with viruses.\n\n3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:46.240\n So I think they're amazing.\n\n3:22:46.240 --> 3:22:51.160\n And I tell my classes, I love viruses.\n\n3:22:51.160 --> 3:22:53.120\n They're amazing, and people think I'm morbid\n\n3:22:53.120 --> 3:22:55.320\n because obviously they kill people,\n\n3:22:55.320 --> 3:22:56.560\n and I shouldn't love something.\n\n3:22:56.560 --> 3:22:57.480\n But that's not the point.\n\n3:22:57.480 --> 3:22:58.320\n That's not what I mean.\n\n3:22:58.320 --> 3:23:00.520\n I love them in the way they have emerged\n\n3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.080\n and how they work and so forth\n\n3:23:03.080 --> 3:23:04.240\n and all that we don't know about them.\n\n3:23:04.240 --> 3:23:06.240\n So you need to be curious and passionate,\n\n3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:07.720\n and don't plan too much.\n\n3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:11.040\n And just find something that you don't call a job.\n\n3:23:12.240 --> 3:23:14.520\n As someone said on the livestream last week,\n\n3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:17.360\n I wish I had a job I liked as much as you.\n\n3:23:17.360 --> 3:23:18.440\n I said, it's not a job.\n\n3:23:18.440 --> 3:23:20.400\n I never looked at it as a job.\n\n3:23:20.400 --> 3:23:23.720\n It's my vocation, it's my passion.\n\n3:23:23.720 --> 3:23:25.880\n If it's a job, then you're not gonna like it.\n\n3:23:25.880 --> 3:23:28.400\n Yeah, something that doesn't feel like a job.\n\n3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:33.040\n So you said viruses are kind of passive,\n\n3:23:33.880 --> 3:23:38.520\n nonliving, you could say, or even cells are passive.\n\n3:23:38.520 --> 3:23:39.840\n And humans are kind of active.\n\n3:23:39.840 --> 3:23:42.320\n We seem to be making our own decisions.\n\n3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:44.720\n So let me ask you the why question.\n\n3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:47.620\n What do you think is the meaning of this life of ours?\n\n3:23:47.620 --> 3:23:49.780\n Oh, there's no meaning.\n\n3:23:49.780 --> 3:23:51.340\n It just happened.\n\n3:23:51.340 --> 3:23:52.260\n It's an accident.\n\n3:23:53.500 --> 3:23:55.020\n I think there's no life elsewhere\n\n3:23:55.020 --> 3:23:56.740\n because this is just a rare accident\n\n3:23:56.740 --> 3:23:58.660\n that happened in the right conditions.\n\n3:23:58.660 --> 3:24:00.300\n I mean, people all think I'm wrong\n\n3:24:00.300 --> 3:24:01.700\n because there are billions and billions\n\n3:24:01.700 --> 3:24:02.860\n of stars out there, right?\n\n3:24:02.860 --> 3:24:05.140\n So there's a lot of opportunity.\n\n3:24:05.140 --> 3:24:06.260\n There's no meaning.\n\n3:24:06.260 --> 3:24:10.500\n It's just, what do they call it?\n\n3:24:10.500 --> 3:24:12.660\n A perfect storm of events\n\n3:24:12.660 --> 3:24:14.900\n that led to molecules being formed.\n\n3:24:14.900 --> 3:24:17.260\n And eventually, I mean, it took a long time\n\n3:24:17.260 --> 3:24:19.900\n for life to evolve, right?\n\n3:24:19.900 --> 3:24:23.980\n But it's just driven by conditions.\n\n3:24:23.980 --> 3:24:25.500\n If something emerged that worked,\n\n3:24:25.500 --> 3:24:26.980\n it would then go on to the next step.\n\n3:24:26.980 --> 3:24:29.140\n There's no meaning other than that.\n\n3:24:29.140 --> 3:24:31.100\n The only difference is that we,\n\n3:24:32.180 --> 3:24:34.060\n and I think many other animals can probably,\n\n3:24:34.060 --> 3:24:36.020\n we have the ability, we're sentient, right?\n\n3:24:36.020 --> 3:24:38.200\n We can influence what happens to us.\n\n3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:41.420\n We can take medicines, right?\n\n3:24:41.420 --> 3:24:44.420\n We can alter what would normally happen to us.\n\n3:24:44.420 --> 3:24:47.860\n So we can remove some of the selection pressure.\n\n3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:50.840\n But I think everything else on the planet\n\n3:24:50.840 --> 3:24:55.180\n just goes, looks for food and give a lot of offspring\n\n3:24:55.180 --> 3:24:56.220\n so you can perpetuate.\n\n3:24:56.220 --> 3:24:58.740\n It's just a natural biological function.\n\n3:24:58.740 --> 3:25:01.980\n Yeah, they're much more directly concerned with survival.\n\n3:25:01.980 --> 3:25:04.620\n I think humans are able to contemplate their mortality.\n\n3:25:04.620 --> 3:25:08.500\n We can see that even if we're okay today,\n\n3:25:08.500 --> 3:25:10.300\n we're eventually going to die\n\n3:25:10.300 --> 3:25:13.020\n and we really don't like that.\n\n3:25:13.020 --> 3:25:16.140\n So we try to come up with ways to push that deadline\n\n3:25:16.140 --> 3:25:17.060\n farther and farther away.\n\n3:25:17.060 --> 3:25:18.740\n Well, we have really, I mean,\n\n3:25:18.740 --> 3:25:20.460\n we used to die in our 30s, right?\n\n3:25:20.460 --> 3:25:22.020\n Now it's 70s, 80s.\n\n3:25:22.020 --> 3:25:26.140\n Well, most of us used to die in the first few weeks.\n\n3:25:26.140 --> 3:25:27.260\n That's true.\n\n3:25:27.260 --> 3:25:29.140\n Yeah, infant death.\n\n3:25:29.140 --> 3:25:34.140\n I always tell people the only thing that's 100% is death.\n\n3:25:34.260 --> 3:25:36.300\n It's the only thing in the world that's 100%.\n\n3:25:36.300 --> 3:25:37.700\n Do you think about your own mortality?\n\n3:25:37.700 --> 3:25:39.020\n No, I never think about it.\n\n3:25:39.020 --> 3:25:42.220\n I'm just enjoying day to day and I don't think about it.\n\n3:25:42.220 --> 3:25:43.060\n Really?\n\n3:25:43.060 --> 3:25:44.140\n You work on viruses.\n\n3:25:44.140 --> 3:25:47.580\n You don't contemplate your own mortality\n\n3:25:47.580 --> 3:25:51.660\n given the deadliness of the viruses around us?\n\n3:25:51.660 --> 3:25:53.580\n I never thought COVID would kill me.\n\n3:25:53.580 --> 3:25:55.460\n No, I never was afraid of that.\n\n3:25:55.460 --> 3:25:56.460\n Not at all.\n\n3:25:56.460 --> 3:26:00.380\n I mostly feared for other people getting sick,\n\n3:26:00.380 --> 3:26:02.380\n especially people who could die of it.\n\n3:26:02.380 --> 3:26:03.600\n I didn't want that to happen to them.\n\n3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:06.860\n But I always thought that it's obviously\n\n3:26:06.860 --> 3:26:10.740\n not a realistic viewpoint not to be worried\n\n3:26:10.740 --> 3:26:13.820\n because many people are.\n\n3:26:13.820 --> 3:26:16.060\n But I've been relatively healthy.\n\n3:26:17.100 --> 3:26:19.740\n They should sequence my genome because it works really well\n\n3:26:19.740 --> 3:26:21.260\n and I have a good immune system.\n\n3:26:21.260 --> 3:26:24.100\n Maybe you'd be the first immortal person.\n\n3:26:24.100 --> 3:26:25.820\n There's gotta be a first.\n\n3:26:25.820 --> 3:26:27.100\n I don't think so.\n\n3:26:27.100 --> 3:26:31.180\n I think that biologically you just can't,\n\n3:26:31.180 --> 3:26:32.940\n the ends of our chromosomes keep getting\n\n3:26:32.940 --> 3:26:36.120\n shorter and shorter and that's eventually what kills us.\n\n3:26:37.200 --> 3:26:39.580\n So you just can't keep going on.\n\n3:26:39.580 --> 3:26:42.220\n But that's fine, I don't need to.\n\n3:26:42.220 --> 3:26:43.700\n I understand from the vampires\n\n3:26:43.700 --> 3:26:45.460\n that it's not good to live forever.\n\n3:26:47.340 --> 3:26:50.380\n I guess make the most of the time you got.\n\n3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:53.200\n That's the, bacteria live a much shorter time\n\n3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:55.180\n so we got that on bacteria.\n\n3:26:55.180 --> 3:27:00.100\n Bacteria are just little bags of chemicals that split.\n\n3:27:00.100 --> 3:27:05.100\n So they have no stake in the matter at all.\n\n3:27:05.260 --> 3:27:06.540\n It doesn't bother.\n\n3:27:06.540 --> 3:27:08.180\n I think that you have to go a long ways\n\n3:27:08.180 --> 3:27:12.960\n before you get into some kind of consciousness.\n\n3:27:12.960 --> 3:27:15.420\n Yeah, it's weird that this bag of chemicals\n\n3:27:15.420 --> 3:27:17.040\n has a stake in the matter.\n\n3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:21.380\n Like our human body, consciousness is a weird thing.\n\n3:27:21.380 --> 3:27:23.540\n Not just in us, but they make half of the oxygen\n\n3:27:23.540 --> 3:27:24.380\n on the planet.\n\n3:27:24.380 --> 3:27:26.340\n 20% of the oxygen comes from bacteria.\n\n3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:29.900\n And they made, in the beginning of Earth,\n\n3:27:29.900 --> 3:27:34.060\n they made enough oxygen to start oxygenation going,\n\n3:27:34.060 --> 3:27:34.900\n life going.\n\n3:27:34.900 --> 3:27:36.500\n I mean, they have an incredible role.\n\n3:27:36.500 --> 3:27:38.300\n It's all an accident, just happened.\n\n3:27:40.500 --> 3:27:44.660\n Well, Vincent, like I told you, I'm a huge fan.\n\n3:27:44.660 --> 3:27:47.060\n It's a big honor that you would talk to me today.\n\n3:27:47.060 --> 3:27:48.420\n Thank you so much for coming down.\n\n3:27:48.420 --> 3:27:50.620\n Thank you for spending so much time with me.\n\n3:27:51.660 --> 3:27:53.020\n And thank you for everything you do\n\n3:27:53.020 --> 3:27:54.900\n in terms of educating about viruses,\n\n3:27:54.900 --> 3:27:57.300\n about biology, microbiology, and everything else.\n\n3:27:57.300 --> 3:27:58.160\n I can't wait.\n\n3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:00.540\n Everybody should check out Vincent's YouTube,\n\n3:28:00.540 --> 3:28:03.020\n watch his lectures, listen to the podcast.\n\n3:28:03.020 --> 3:28:05.060\n It's truly incredible.\n\n3:28:05.060 --> 3:28:06.780\n Thank you so much for talking to me, Vincent.\n\n3:28:06.780 --> 3:28:08.220\n My pleasure.\n\n3:28:08.220 --> 3:28:10.220\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:28:10.220 --> 3:28:12.260\n with Vincent Racaniello.\n\n3:28:12.260 --> 3:28:13.380\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:28:13.380 --> 3:28:16.540\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:28:16.540 --> 3:28:18.740\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:20.980\n from Isaac Asimov.\n\n3:28:20.980 --> 3:28:23.140\n The saddest aspect of life right now\n\n3:28:23.140 --> 3:28:25.380\n is that science gathers knowledge\n\n3:28:25.380 --> 3:28:27.720\n faster than society gathers wisdom.\n\n3:28:27.720 --> 3:28:37.720\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
