founder and CEO of Square.\n\n00:08.760 --> 00:12.240\n Given the happenings at the time related to Twitter leadership\n\n00:12.240 --> 00:13.960\n and the very limited time we had,\n\n00:13.960 --> 00:16.680\n we decided to focus this conversation on Square\n\n00:16.680 --> 00:18.880\n and some broader philosophical topics\n\n00:18.880 --> 00:20.840\n and to save an in depth conversation\n\n00:20.840 --> 00:23.080\n on engineering and AI at Twitter\n\n00:23.080 --> 00:25.840\n for a second appearance in this podcast.\n\n00:25.840 --> 00:27.320\n This conversation was recorded\n\n00:27.320 --> 00:29.480\n before the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n00:29.480 --> 00:31.880\n For everyone feeling the medical, psychological\n\n00:31.880 --> 00:33.840\n and financial burden of this crisis,\n\n00:33.840 --> 00:35.520\n I'm sending love your way.\n\n00:35.520 --> 00:36.560\n Stay strong.\n\n00:36.560 --> 00:37.720\n We're in this together.\n\n00:37.720 --> 00:38.800\n We'll beat this thing.\n\n00:39.840 --> 00:41.480\n As an aside, let me mention\n\n00:41.480 --> 00:45.280\n that Jack moved $1 billion of Square equity,\n\n00:45.280 --> 00:47.560\n which is 28% of his wealth\n\n00:47.560 --> 00:51.440\n to form an organization that funds COVID 19 relief.\n\n00:51.440 --> 00:53.840\n First, as Andrew Yang tweeted,\n\n00:53.840 --> 00:56.280\n this is a spectacular commitment.\n\n00:56.280 --> 00:59.600\n And second, it is amazing that it operates transparently\n\n00:59.600 --> 01:03.360\n by posting all its donations to a single Google doc.\n\n01:03.360 --> 01:06.160\n To me, true transparency is simple.\n\n01:06.160 --> 01:08.320\n And this is as simple as it gets.\n\n01:09.360 --> 01:11.840\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:11.840 --> 01:13.720\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:13.720 --> 01:15.960\n review it with five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:15.960 --> 01:17.080\n support it on

minutes of ads now\n\n01:24.640 --> 01:26.080\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n01:26.080 --> 01:28.200\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:28.200 --> 01:29.480\n I hope that works for you\n\n01:29.480 --> 01:32.160\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:32.160 --> 01:34.800\n This show is presented by Masterclass.\n\n01:34.800 --> 01:37.880\n Sign up on

thought it was too good to be true.\n\n01:44.360 --> 01:46.520\n For $180 a year,\n\n01:46.520 --> 01:49.600\n you get an all access pass to watch courses from,\n\n01:49.600 --> 01:51.360\n to list some of my favorites,\n\n01:51.360 --> 01:53.680\n Chris Hadfield on space exploration,\n\n01:53.680 --> 01:55.800\n Neil deGrasse Tyson on scientific thinking\n\n01:55.800 --> 01:57.000\n and communication,\n\n01:57.000 --> 02:00.000\n Will Wright, creator of SimCity and Sims,\n\n02:00.000 --> 02:03.160\n both one of my favorite games on game design,\n\n02:03.160 --> 02:05.520\n Jane Goodall on conservation,\n\n02:05.520 --> 02:07.200\n Carlos Santana on guitar,\n\n02:07.200 --> 02:08.960\n one of my favorite guitar players,\n\n02:08.960 --> 02:10.760\n Gary Kasparov on chess,\n\n02:10.760 --> 02:13.960\n Daniel Nagrano on poker and many, many more.\n\n02:13.960 --> 02:17.040\n Chris Hadfield explaining how rockets work\n\n02:17.040 --> 02:19.520\n and the experience of being launched into space alone\n\n02:19.520 --> 02:20.840\n is worth the money.\n\n02:20.840 --> 02:22.640\n For me, the key is to not be overwhelmed\n\n02:22.640 --> 02:24.280\n by the abundance of choice.\n\n02:24.280 --> 02:26.400\n Pick three courses you want to complete,\n\n02:26.400 --> 02:28.240\n watch each all the way through.\n\n02:28.240 --> 02:29.440\n It's not that long,\n\n02:29.440 --> 02:31.120\n but it's an experience that will stick with you\n\n02:31.120 --> 02:32.880\n for a long time.\n\n02:32.880 --> 02:34.640\n It's easily worth the money.\n\n02:34.640 --> 02:37.280\n You can watch it on basically any device.\n\n02:37.280 --> 02:41.040\n Once again, sign up on masterclass.com slash Lex\n\n02:41.040 --> 02:44.440\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n02:44.440 --> 02:47.820\n And now, here's my conversation with Jack Dorsey.\n\n02:48.840 --> 02:50.720\n You've been on several podcasts,\n\n02:50.720 --> 02:53.520\n Joe Rogan, Sam Harris, Rach Roll, others,\n\n02:53.520 --> 02:55.280\n excellent conversations,\n\n02:55.280 --> 02:57.520\n but I think there's several topics\n\n02:57.520 --> 03:00.040\n that you didn't talk about that I think are fascinating\n\n03:00.040 --> 03:01.780\n that I'd love to talk to you about,\n\n03:01.780 --> 03:04.160\n sort of machine learning, artificial intelligence,\n\n03:04.160 --> 03:06.280\n both the narrow kind and the general kind\n\n03:06.280 --> 03:08.560\n and engineering at scale.\n\n03:08.560 --> 03:11.240\n So there's a lot of incredible engineering going on\n\n03:11.240 --> 03:12.400\n that you're a part of,\n\n03:12.400 --> 03:16.240\n crypto, cryptocurrency, blockchain, UBI,\n\n03:16.240 --> 03:18.640\n all kinds of philosophical questions maybe we'll get to\n\n03:18.640 --> 03:21.660\n about life and death and meaning and beauty.\n\n03:21.660 --> 03:24.520\n So you're involved in building some of\n\n03:25.480 --> 03:27.800\n the biggest network systems in the world,\n\n03:27.800 --> 03:30.840\n sort of trillions of interactions a day.\n\n03:30.840 --> 03:33.160\n The cool thing about that is the infrastructure,\n\n03:33.160 --> 03:35.080\n the engineering at scale.\n\n03:35.080 --> 03:38.600\n You started as a programmer with C building.\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:39.420\n Yeah, so.\n\n03:39.420 --> 03:41.080\n I'm a hacker, I'm not really an engineer.\n\n03:41.080 --> 03:43.000\n Not a legit software engineer,\n\n03:43.000 --> 03:44.360\n you're a hacker at heart.\n\n03:44.360 --> 03:47.280\n But to achieve scale, you have to do some,\n\n03:47.280 --> 03:49.920\n unfortunately, legit large scale engineering.\n\n03:49.920 --> 03:52.800\n So how do you make that magic happen?\n\n03:52.800 --> 03:57.540\n Hire people that I can learn from, number one.\n\n03:57.540 --> 04:00.280\n I mean, I'm a hacker in the sense that I,\n\n04:00.280 --> 04:02.340\n my approach has always been do whatever it takes\n\n04:02.340 --> 04:03.180\n to make it work.\n\n04:04.600 --> 04:07.640\n So that I can see and feel the thing\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:09.540\n and then learn what needs to come next.\n\n04:09.540 --> 04:13.260\n And oftentimes what needs to come next is\n\n04:13.260 --> 04:16.260\n a matter of being able to bring it to more people,\n\n04:16.260 --> 04:17.520\n which is scale.\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:21.960\n And there's a lot of great people out there\n\n04:21.960 --> 04:26.200\n that either have experience or are extremely fast learners\n\n04:27.760 --> 04:30.200\n that we've been lucky enough to find\n\n04:30.200 --> 04:33.680\n and work with for years.\n\n04:33.680 --> 04:35.440\n But I think a lot of it,\n\n04:35.440 --> 04:39.560\n we benefit a ton from the open source community\n\n04:39.560 --> 04:41.460\n and just all the learnings there\n\n04:41.460 --> 04:44.480\n that are laid bare in the open.\n\n04:44.480 --> 04:46.480\n All the mistakes, all the success,\n\n04:46.480 --> 04:48.640\n all the problems.\n\n04:48.640 --> 04:53.420\n It's a very slow moving process usually open source,\n\n04:53.420 --> 04:54.600\n but it's very deliberate.\n\n04:54.600 --> 04:58.520\n And you get to see because of the pace,\n\n04:58.520 --> 05:00.280\n you get to see what it takes\n\n05:00.280 --> 05:02.600\n to really build something meaningful.\n\n05:02.600 --> 05:06.680\n So I learned most of everything I learned about hacking\n\n05:06.680 --> 05:11.000\n and programming and engineering has been due to open source\n\n05:11.000 --> 05:16.000\n and the generosity that people have given\n\n05:19.720 --> 05:21.640\n to give up their time, sacrifice their time\n\n05:21.640 --> 05:24.440\n without any expectation in return,\n\n05:24.440 --> 05:27.320\n other than being a part of something\n\n05:27.320 --> 05:29.800\n much larger than themselves, which I think is great.\n\n05:29.800 --> 05:31.400\n Open source movement is amazing.\n\n05:31.400 --> 05:33.520\n But if you just look at the scale,\n\n05:33.520 --> 05:35.660\n like Square has to take care of,\n\n05:35.660 --> 05:38.720\n is this fundamentally a software problem\n\n05:38.720 --> 05:39.760\n or a hardware problem?\n\n05:39.760 --> 05:41.900\n You mentioned hiring a bunch of people,\n\n05:41.900 --> 05:45.880\n but it's not, maybe from my perspective,\n\n05:45.880 --> 05:48.920\n not often talked about how incredible that is\n\n05:48.920 --> 05:52.160\n to sort of have a system that doesn't go down often,\n\n05:52.160 --> 05:54.500\n that is secure, is able to take care\n\n05:54.500 --> 05:55.960\n of all these transactions.\n\n05:55.960 --> 05:58.800\n Like maybe I'm also a hacker at heart\n\n05:58.800 --> 06:01.100\n and it's incredible to me that that kind of scale\n\n06:01.100 --> 06:02.200\n could be achieved.\n\n06:02.200 --> 06:06.380\n Is there some insight, some lessons,\n\n06:06.380 --> 06:10.080\n some interesting tidbits that you can say\n\n06:10.080 --> 06:12.280\n how to make that scale happen?\n\n06:12.280 --> 06:14.240\n Is it the hardware fundamentally challenge?\n\n06:14.240 --> 06:16.000\n Is it a software challenge?\n\n06:19.200 --> 06:23.800\n Is it a social challenge of building large teams\n\n06:23.800 --> 06:25.520\n of engineers that work together, that kind of thing?\n\n06:25.520 --> 06:28.560\n Like what's the interesting challenges there?\n\n06:28.560 --> 06:31.040\n By the way, you're the best dressed hacker I've met.\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:32.300\n I think the. Thank you.\n\n06:34.120 --> 06:36.000\n If the enumeration you just went through,\n\n06:36.000 --> 06:37.360\n I don't think there's one.\n\n06:37.360 --> 06:39.760\n You have to kind of focus on all\n\n06:39.760 --> 06:43.120\n and the ability to focus on all that\n\n06:43.120 --> 06:47.040\n really comes down to how you face problems\n\n06:47.040 --> 06:51.000\n and whether you can break them down into parts\n\n06:51.000 --> 06:53.600\n that you can focus on.\n\n06:53.600 --> 06:58.200\n Because I think the biggest mistake is trying to solve\n\n06:58.200 --> 07:00.780\n or address too many at once\n\n07:02.300 --> 07:05.200\n or not going deep enough with the questions\n\n07:05.200 --> 07:08.660\n or not being critical of the answers you find\n\n07:08.660 --> 07:13.660\n or not taking the time to form credible hypotheses\n\n07:15.720 --> 07:19.480\n that you can actually test and you can see the results of.\n\n07:19.480 --> 07:24.480\n So all of those fall in the face of ultimately\n\n07:25.520 --> 07:27.880\n critical thinking skills, problem solving skills.\n\n07:27.880 --> 07:30.720\n And if there's one skill I want to improve every day,\n\n07:30.720 --> 07:34.960\n it's that that's what contributes to the learning\n\n07:34.960 --> 07:38.800\n and the only way we can evolve any of these things\n\n07:38.800 --> 07:41.440\n is learning what it's currently doing\n\n07:41.440 --> 07:44.320\n and how to take it to the next step.\n\n07:44.320 --> 07:45.540\n And questioning assumptions,\n\n07:45.540 --> 07:47.200\n the first principles kind of thinking,\n\n07:47.200 --> 07:50.640\n seems like a fundamental to this whole process.\n\n07:50.640 --> 07:53.260\n Yeah, but if you get too overextended into,\n\n07:53.260 --> 07:54.960\n well, this is a hardware issue,\n\n07:54.960 --> 07:56.940\n you miss all the software solutions.\n\n07:56.940 --> 08:01.940\n And vice versa, if you focus too much on the software,\n\n08:01.940 --> 08:06.700\n there are hardware solutions that can 10X the thing.\n\n08:06.700 --> 08:11.700\n So I try to resist the categories of thinking\n\n08:13.420 --> 08:16.080\n and look for the underlying systems\n\n08:16.080 --> 08:18.100\n that make all these things work.\n\n08:18.100 --> 08:22.540\n But those only emerge when you have a skill\n\n08:22.540 --> 08:27.180\n around creative thinking, problem solving,\n\n08:27.180 --> 08:32.180\n and being able to ask critical questions\n\n08:33.620 --> 08:35.460\n and having the patience to go deep.\n\n08:36.420 --> 08:38.460\n So one of the amazing things,\n\n08:38.460 --> 08:40.580\n if we look at the mission of Square,\n\n08:40.580 --> 08:45.020\n is to increase people's access to the economy.\n\n08:45.020 --> 08:46.840\n Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n08:46.840 --> 08:47.900\n that's from my perspective.\n\n08:47.900 --> 08:49.560\n So from the perspective of merchants,\n\n08:49.560 --> 08:52.780\n peer to peer payments, even crypto, cryptocurrency,\n\n08:52.780 --> 08:56.140\n digital cryptocurrency, what do you see as the major ways\n\n08:56.140 --> 08:59.460\n that our society can increase participation in the economy?\n\n08:59.460 --> 09:01.420\n So if we look at today and the next 10 years,\n\n09:01.420 --> 09:04.380\n next 20 years, you go into Africa, maybe in Africa\n\n09:04.380 --> 09:07.560\n and all kinds of other places outside of the North America.\n\n09:09.380 --> 09:13.980\n If there was one word that I think represents\n\n09:13.980 --> 09:17.220\n what we're trying to do at Square, it is that word access.\n\n09:19.100 --> 09:21.820\n One of the things we found is that\n\n09:21.820 --> 09:23.500\n we weren't expecting this at all.\n\n09:23.500 --> 09:25.300\n When we started, we thought we were just building\n\n09:25.300 --> 09:29.140\n a piece of hardware to enable people\n\n09:29.140 --> 09:32.100\n to plug it into their phone and swipe a credit card.\n\n09:32.100 --> 09:34.420\n And then as we talked with people\n\n09:34.420 --> 09:37.660\n who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past,\n\n09:37.660 --> 09:40.460\n we found a consistent theme, which many of them\n\n09:40.460 --> 09:44.100\n weren't even enabled, not enabled,\n\n09:44.100 --> 09:46.580\n but allowed to process credit cards.\n\n09:46.580 --> 09:50.580\n And we dug a little bit deeper, again, asking that question.\n\n09:50.580 --> 09:54.300\n And we found that a lot of them would go to banks\n\n09:54.300 --> 09:57.260\n or these merchant acquirers.\n\n09:57.260 --> 10:01.000\n And waiting for them was a credit check\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:03.220\n and looking at a FICA score.\n\n10:03.220 --> 10:07.700\n And many of the businesses that we talked to\n\n10:07.700 --> 10:09.580\n and many small businesses,\n\n10:09.580 --> 10:13.580\n they don't have good credit or a credit history.\n\n10:15.220 --> 10:17.780\n They're entrepreneurs who are just getting started,\n\n10:17.780 --> 10:20.120\n taking a lot of personal risk, financial risk.\n\n10:21.300 --> 10:24.060\n And it just felt ridiculous to us\n\n10:24.060 --> 10:29.060\n that for the job of being able to accept money from people,\n\n10:31.980 --> 10:33.700\n you had to get your credit checked.\n\n10:33.700 --> 10:36.500\n And as we dug deeper, we realized that\n\n10:36.500 --> 10:38.540\n that wasn't the intention of the financial industry,\n\n10:38.540 --> 10:42.220\n but it's the only tool they had available to them\n\n10:42.220 --> 10:45.540\n to understand authenticity, intent,\n\n10:46.400 --> 10:49.140\n predictor of future behavior.\n\n10:49.140 --> 10:50.820\n So that's the first thing we actually looked at.\n\n10:50.820 --> 10:52.620\n And that's where the, you know, we built the hardware,\n\n10:52.620 --> 10:57.460\n but the software really came in terms of risk modeling.\n\n10:57.460 --> 11:00.700\n And that's when we started down the path\n\n11:00.700 --> 11:03.040\n that eventually leads to AI.\n\n11:03.040 --> 11:07.620\n We started with a very strong data science discipline\n\n11:08.580 --> 11:10.260\n because we knew that our business\n\n11:10.260 --> 11:13.860\n was not necessarily about making hardware.\n\n11:13.860 --> 11:17.080\n It was more about enabling more people\n\n11:17.080 --> 11:18.620\n to come into the system.\n\n11:18.620 --> 11:21.220\n So the fundamental challenge there is,\n\n11:21.220 --> 11:23.420\n so to enable more people to come into the system,\n\n11:23.420 --> 11:26.780\n you have to lower the barrier of checking\n\n11:26.780 --> 11:30.500\n that that person will be a legitimate vendor.\n\n11:30.500 --> 11:31.740\n Is that the fundamental problem?\n\n11:31.740 --> 11:33.980\n Yeah, and a different mindset.\n\n11:33.980 --> 11:36.340\n I think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset\n\n11:36.340 --> 11:41.340\n of kind of distrust and just constantly looking\n\n11:41.340 --> 11:46.340\n for opportunities to prove why people shouldn't get\n\n11:46.340 --> 11:50.340\n into the system, whereas we took on a mindset of trust\n\n11:50.340 --> 11:52.980\n and then verify, verify, verify, verify, verify.\n\n11:52.980 --> 11:53.820\n Yes.\n\n11:53.820 --> 11:58.820\n So we moved, you know, when we entered the space,\n\n12:00.100 --> 12:03.260\n only about 30 to 40% of the people who applied\n\n12:03.260 --> 12:05.860\n to accept credit cards would actually get through the system.\n\n12:05.860 --> 12:08.700\n We took that knowledge, we took it to the next level.\n\n12:08.700 --> 12:11.540\n If we applied to accept credit cards,\n\n12:11.540 --> 12:13.180\n we'd actually get through the system.\n\n12:13.180 --> 12:15.620\n We took that number to 99%.\n\n12:15.620 --> 12:19.100\n And that's because we reframed the problem,\n\n12:19.100 --> 12:24.100\n we built credible models, and we had this mindset of,\n\n12:25.540 --> 12:28.420\n we're going to watch not at the merchant level,\n\n12:28.420 --> 12:30.740\n but we're gonna watch at the transaction level.\n\n12:30.740 --> 12:35.020\n So come in, perform some transactions,\n\n12:35.020 --> 12:36.620\n and as long as you're doing things\n\n12:36.620 --> 12:40.460\n with integrity, credible, and don't look suspicious,\n\n12:40.460 --> 12:43.300\n we'll continue to serve you.\n\n12:43.300 --> 12:47.620\n If we see any interestingness in how you use our system,\n\n12:47.620 --> 12:50.780\n that will be bubbled up to people to review,\n\n12:50.780 --> 12:53.460\n to figure out if there's something nefarious going on,\n\n12:53.460 --> 12:56.020\n and that's when we might ask you to leave.\n\n12:56.020 --> 13:01.020\n So the change in the mindset led to the technology\n\n13:01.020 --> 13:06.020\n that we needed to enable more people to get through,\n\n13:06.460 --> 13:08.900\n and to enable more people to access the system.\n\n13:08.900 --> 13:11.780\n What role does machine learning play into that,\n\n13:11.780 --> 13:15.340\n in that context of, you said,\n\n13:15.340 --> 13:17.580\n first of all, it's a beautiful shift.\n\n13:17.580 --> 13:20.500\n Anytime you shift your viewpoint into seeing\n\n13:20.500 --> 13:23.120\n that people are fundamentally good,\n\n13:24.020 --> 13:25.860\n and then you just have to verify\n\n13:25.860 --> 13:27.660\n and catch the ones who are not,\n\n13:27.660 --> 13:30.300\n as opposed to assuming everybody's bad,\n\n13:30.300 --> 13:31.580\n this is a beautiful thing.\n\n13:31.580 --> 13:35.020\n So what role does the, to you,\n\n13:35.940 --> 13:37.300\n throughout the history of the company,\n\n13:37.300 --> 13:40.500\n has machine learning played in doing that verification?\n\n13:40.500 --> 13:41.820\n It was immediate.\n\n13:41.820 --> 13:43.420\n I mean, we weren't calling it machine learning,\n\n13:43.420 --> 13:45.260\n but it was data science.\n\n13:45.260 --> 13:47.600\n And then as the industry evolved,\n\n13:47.600 --> 13:50.020\n machine learning became more of the nomenclature,\n\n13:50.020 --> 13:54.820\n and as that evolved, it became more sophisticated\n\n13:54.820 --> 13:58.740\n with deep learning, and as that continues to evolve,\n\n13:58.740 --> 13:59.940\n it'll be another thing.\n\n13:59.940 --> 14:02.180\n But they're all in the same vein.\n\n14:02.180 --> 14:04.420\n But we built that discipline up\n\n14:04.420 --> 14:06.940\n within the first year of the company,\n\n14:06.940 --> 14:11.940\n because we also had, we had to partner with a bank,\n\n14:11.940 --> 14:14.340\n we had to partner with Visa and MasterCard,\n\n14:14.340 --> 14:16.160\n and we had to show that,\n\n14:16.160 --> 14:19.260\n by bringing more people into the system,\n\n14:19.260 --> 14:21.460\n that we could do so in a responsible way,\n\n14:21.460 --> 14:23.700\n that would not compromise their systems,\n\n14:23.700 --> 14:25.260\n and that they would trust us.\n\n14:25.260 --> 14:27.820\n How do you convince this upstart company\n\n14:27.820 --> 14:30.620\n with some cool machine learning tricks\n\n14:30.620 --> 14:35.620\n is able to deliver on this trustworthy set of merchants?\n\n14:35.700 --> 14:37.900\n We staged it out in tiers.\n\n14:37.900 --> 14:41.300\n We had a bucket of 500 people using it,\n\n14:41.300 --> 14:43.040\n and then we showed results,\n\n14:43.040 --> 14:45.700\n and then 1,000, and then 10,000, then 50,000,\n\n14:45.700 --> 14:49.940\n and then the constraint was lifted.\n\n14:49.940 --> 14:54.180\n So again, it's kind of getting something tangible out there.\n\n14:54.180 --> 14:58.220\n I want to show what we can do rather than talk about it.\n\n14:58.220 --> 15:00.180\n And that put a lot of pressure on us\n\n15:00.180 --> 15:01.620\n to do the right things.\n\n15:02.900 --> 15:07.300\n And it also created a culture of accountability,\n\n15:07.300 --> 15:09.560\n of a little bit more transparency,\n\n15:10.760 --> 15:15.760\n and I think incentivized all of our early folks\n\n15:15.980 --> 15:18.140\n and the company in the right way.\n\n15:18.140 --> 15:19.900\n So what does the future look like\n\n15:19.900 --> 15:21.920\n in terms of increasing people's access?\n\n15:21.920 --> 15:25.420\n Or if you look at IoT, Internet of Things,\n\n15:25.420 --> 15:27.260\n there's more and more intelligent devices.\n\n15:27.260 --> 15:29.620\n You can see there's some people even talking\n\n15:29.620 --> 15:32.220\n about our personal data as a thing\n\n15:32.220 --> 15:35.940\n that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly.\n\n15:35.940 --> 15:38.460\n Sort of everything can become part of the economy.\n\n15:38.460 --> 15:41.420\n Do you see, so what does the future of Square look like\n\n15:41.420 --> 15:45.620\n in sort of giving people access in all kinds of ways\n\n15:45.620 --> 15:49.240\n to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers?\n\n15:49.240 --> 15:52.500\n I believe that the currency we use\n\n15:52.500 --> 15:55.740\n is a huge part of the answer.\n\n15:55.740 --> 15:58.980\n And I believe that the internet deserves\n\n15:58.980 --> 16:01.780\n and requires a native currency.\n\n16:01.780 --> 16:06.420\n And that's why I'm such a huge believer in Bitcoin\n\n16:07.260 --> 16:10.340\n because it just,\n\n16:11.480 --> 16:13.540\n our biggest problem as a company right now\n\n16:13.540 --> 16:16.380\n is we cannot act like an internet company.\n\n16:16.380 --> 16:17.300\n Open a new market,\n\n16:17.300 --> 16:20.020\n we have to have a partnership with a local bank.\n\n16:20.020 --> 16:21.180\n We have to pay attention\n\n16:21.180 --> 16:24.360\n to different regulatory onboarding environments.\n\n16:25.860 --> 16:29.980\n And a digital currency like Bitcoin\n\n16:29.980 --> 16:31.660\n takes a bunch of that away\n\n16:31.660 --> 16:35.260\n where we can potentially launch a product\n\n16:35.260 --> 16:37.260\n in every single market around the world\n\n16:38.660 --> 16:41.180\n because they're all using the same currency.\n\n16:41.180 --> 16:46.180\n And we have consistent understanding of regulation\n\n16:46.180 --> 16:49.560\n and onboarding and what that means.\n\n16:49.560 --> 16:54.460\n So I think the internet continuing to be accessible\n\n16:54.460 --> 16:57.480\n to people is number one.\n\n16:57.480 --> 17:00.320\n And then I think currency is number two.\n\n17:01.720 --> 17:04.320\n And it will just allow for a lot more innovation,\n\n17:04.320 --> 17:07.800\n a lot more speed in terms of what we can build\n\n17:07.800 --> 17:09.160\n and others can build.\n\n17:09.160 --> 17:11.860\n And it's just really exciting.\n\n17:11.860 --> 17:13.760\n So, I mean, I wanna be able to see that\n\n17:13.760 --> 17:16.240\n and feel that in my lifetime.\n\n17:16.240 --> 17:19.000\n So in this aspect and in other aspects,\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:22.040\n you have a deep interest in cryptocurrency\n\n17:22.040 --> 17:24.040\n and distributed ledger tech in general.\n\n17:24.040 --> 17:27.760\n I talked to Vitalik Buterin yesterday on this podcast.\n\n17:27.760 --> 17:29.040\n He says hi, by the way.\n\n17:29.040 --> 17:29.880\n Hey.\n\n17:29.880 --> 17:33.960\n He's a brilliant, brilliant person.\n\n17:33.960 --> 17:36.160\n Talked a lot about Bitcoin and Ethereum, of course.\n\n17:36.160 --> 17:38.560\n So can you maybe linger on this point?\n\n17:38.560 --> 17:42.400\n What do you find appealing about Bitcoin,\n\n17:42.400 --> 17:43.720\n about digital currency?\n\n17:43.720 --> 17:46.960\n Where do you see it going in the next 10, 20 years?\n\n17:46.960 --> 17:50.740\n And what are some of the challenges with respect to Square\n\n17:50.740 --> 17:55.320\n but also just bigger for our globally, for our world,\n\n17:55.320 --> 17:58.420\n for the way we think about money?\n\n17:59.360 --> 18:01.560\n I think the most beautiful thing about it\n\n18:01.560 --> 18:04.180\n is there's no one person setting the direction.\n\n18:05.880 --> 18:07.760\n And there's no one person on the other side\n\n18:07.760 --> 18:08.600\n that can stop it.\n\n18:08.600 --> 18:13.600\n So we have something that is pretty organic in nature\n\n18:15.160 --> 18:18.400\n and very principled in its original design.\n\n18:19.600 --> 18:22.400\n And I think the Bitcoin white paper\n\n18:22.400 --> 18:24.660\n is one of the most seminal works of computer science\n\n18:24.660 --> 18:27.260\n in the last 20, 30 years.\n\n18:28.480 --> 18:30.020\n It's poetry.\n\n18:30.020 --> 18:30.860\n I mean, it really is.\n\n18:30.860 --> 18:32.180\n Yeah, it's a pretty cool technology.\n\n18:32.180 --> 18:33.640\n That's not often talked about.\n\n18:33.640 --> 18:36.940\n There's so much hype around digital currency\n\n18:36.940 --> 18:38.580\n about the financial impacts of it.\n\n18:38.580 --> 18:40.520\n But the actual technology is quite beautiful\n\n18:40.520 --> 18:42.200\n from a computer science perspective.\n\n18:42.200 --> 18:44.320\n Yeah, and the underlying principles behind it\n\n18:44.320 --> 18:46.000\n that went into it, even to the point\n\n18:46.000 --> 18:47.700\n of releasing it under a pseudonym.\n\n18:48.660 --> 18:51.320\n I think that's a very, very powerful statement.\n\n18:51.320 --> 18:54.200\n The timing of when it was released is powerful.\n\n18:54.200 --> 18:58.180\n It was a total activist move.\n\n18:58.180 --> 19:00.560\n I mean, it's moving the world forward\n\n19:00.560 --> 19:05.560\n in a way that I think is extremely noble and honorable\n\n19:05.560 --> 19:08.920\n and enables everyone to be part of the story,\n\n19:08.920 --> 19:10.400\n which is also really cool.\n\n19:10.400 --> 19:13.880\n So you asked a question around 10 years and 20 years.\n\n19:13.880 --> 19:16.840\n I mean, I think the amazing thing is no one knows.\n\n19:17.840 --> 19:19.040\n And it can emerge.\n\n19:19.040 --> 19:22.200\n And every person that comes into the ecosystem,\n\n19:22.200 --> 19:26.680\n whether they be a developer or someone who uses it,\n\n19:27.680 --> 19:30.880\n can change its direction in small and large ways.\n\n19:31.840 --> 19:33.160\n And that's what I think it should be,\n\n19:33.160 --> 19:36.080\n because that's what the internet has shown is possible.\n\n19:36.080 --> 19:38.360\n Now, there's complications with that, of course.\n\n19:38.360 --> 19:42.480\n And there's certainly companies that own large parts\n\n19:42.480 --> 19:44.440\n of the internet and can direct it more than others.\n\n19:44.440 --> 19:47.880\n And there's not equal access\n\n19:47.880 --> 19:50.160\n to every single person in the world just yet.\n\n19:50.160 --> 19:53.320\n But all those problems are visible enough\n\n19:53.320 --> 19:54.640\n to speak about them.\n\n19:54.640 --> 19:57.560\n And to me, that gives confidence that they're solvable\n\n19:57.560 --> 20:00.720\n in a relatively short timeframe.\n\n20:00.720 --> 20:02.760\n I think the world should be able to do that.\n\n20:02.760 --> 20:06.960\n I think the world changes a lot as we get these satellites\n\n20:08.200 --> 20:11.560\n projecting the internet down to earth,\n\n20:11.560 --> 20:14.320\n because it just removes a bunch of the former constraints\n\n20:15.240 --> 20:18.280\n and really levels the playing field.\n\n20:18.280 --> 20:20.480\n But a global currency,\n\n20:20.480 --> 20:24.920\n which a native currency for the internet is a proxy for,\n\n20:24.920 --> 20:27.040\n is a very powerful concept.\n\n20:27.040 --> 20:29.080\n And I don't think any one person on this planet\n\n20:29.080 --> 20:31.560\n truly understands the ramifications of that.\n\n20:31.560 --> 20:34.120\n I think there's a lot of positives to it.\n\n20:34.120 --> 20:35.880\n There's some negatives as well.\n\n20:35.880 --> 20:36.720\n But...\n\n20:36.720 --> 20:37.560\n Do you think it's possible, sorry to interrupt,\n\n20:37.560 --> 20:40.840\n do you think it's possible that this kind of digital currency\n\n20:40.840 --> 20:43.440\n would redefine the nature of money,\n\n20:43.440 --> 20:46.400\n so become the main currency of the world,\n\n20:46.400 --> 20:49.080\n as opposed to being tied to fiat currency\n\n20:49.080 --> 20:51.960\n of different nations and sort of really push\n\n20:51.960 --> 20:54.880\n the decentralization of control of money?\n\n20:54.880 --> 20:58.160\n Definitely, but I think the bigger ramification\n\n20:58.160 --> 21:02.280\n is how it affects how society works.\n\n21:02.280 --> 21:06.240\n And I think there are many positive ramifications\n\n21:06.240 --> 21:07.600\n outside of just money.\n\n21:07.600 --> 21:08.800\n Outside of just money.\n\n21:08.800 --> 21:12.160\n Money is a foundational layer that enables so much more.\n\n21:12.160 --> 21:14.920\n I was meeting with an entrepreneur in Ethiopia,\n\n21:14.920 --> 21:19.840\n and payments is probably the number one problem to solve\n\n21:19.840 --> 21:20.920\n across the continent,\n\n21:21.840 --> 21:24.680\n both in terms of moving money across borders\n\n21:24.680 --> 21:26.680\n between nations on the continent,\n\n21:26.680 --> 21:31.680\n or the amount of corruption within the current system.\n\n21:33.720 --> 21:37.880\n But the lack of easy ways to pay people\n\n21:39.280 --> 21:42.440\n makes starting anything really difficult.\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:47.120\n I met an entrepreneur who started the Lyft slash Uber\n\n21:47.120 --> 21:49.840\n of Ethiopia, and one of the biggest problems she has\n\n21:49.840 --> 21:54.760\n is that it's not easy for her riders to pay the company,\n\n21:54.760 --> 21:56.800\n it's not easy for her to pay the drivers.\n\n21:57.800 --> 22:00.800\n And that definitely has stunted her growth\n\n22:00.800 --> 22:02.400\n and made everything more challenging.\n\n22:02.400 --> 22:07.160\n So the fact that she even has to think about payments\n\n22:07.160 --> 22:10.280\n instead of thinking about the best rider experience\n\n22:10.280 --> 22:15.080\n and the best driver experience is pretty telling.\n\n22:15.080 --> 22:20.080\n So I think as we get a more durable, resilient\n\n22:20.080 --> 22:25.080\n and global standard, we see a lot more innovation everywhere.\n\n22:26.400 --> 22:29.080\n And I think there's no better case study for this\n\n22:29.080 --> 22:32.080\n than the various countries within Africa\n\n22:32.080 --> 22:35.080\n and their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things\n\n22:35.080 --> 22:38.800\n within health or sustainability or transportation\n\n22:38.800 --> 22:42.520\n or a lot of the companies that we've seen here.\n\n22:42.520 --> 22:47.280\n So the majority of companies I met in November\n\n22:47.280 --> 22:51.280\n when I spent a month on the continent were payments oriented.\n\n22:52.400 --> 22:54.280\n You mentioned, and this is a small tangent,\n\n22:54.280 --> 22:58.320\n you mentioned the anonymous launch of Bitcoin\n\n22:58.320 --> 23:00.720\n is a sort of profound philosophical statement.\n\n23:00.720 --> 23:02.040\n Pseudonymous.\n\n23:02.040 --> 23:03.640\n What's that even mean?\n\n23:03.640 --> 23:04.480\n There's a pseudonym.\n\n23:04.480 --> 23:05.320\n First of all, let me ask.\n\n23:05.320 --> 23:06.480\n There's an identity tied to it.\n\n23:06.480 --> 23:10.080\n It's not just anonymous, it's Nakamoto.\n\n23:10.080 --> 23:13.440\n So Nakamoto might represent one person or multiple people.\n\n23:13.440 --> 23:15.840\n But let me ask, are you Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n23:15.840 --> 23:17.520\n Just checking, catch you off guard.\n\n23:17.520 --> 23:18.520\n And if I were, would I tell you?\n\n23:18.520 --> 23:19.640\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n23:19.640 --> 23:21.120\n Maybe you slip.\n\n23:21.120 --> 23:25.120\n A pseudonym is constructed identity.\n\n23:25.120 --> 23:28.040\n Anonymity is just kind of this random,\n\n23:28.040 --> 23:32.080\n like drop something off and leave.\n\n23:32.080 --> 23:34.480\n There's no intention to build an identity around it.\n\n23:34.480 --> 23:39.480\n And while the identity being built was a short time window,\n\n23:39.480 --> 23:44.480\n it was meant to stick around, I think, and to be known.\n\n23:44.840 --> 23:49.840\n And it's being honored in how the community\n\n23:50.040 --> 23:50.880\n thinks about building it,\n\n23:50.880 --> 23:54.400\n like the concept of Satoshi's, for instance,\n\n23:55.400 --> 23:56.920\n is one such example.\n\n23:56.920 --> 24:01.400\n But I think it was smart not to do it anonymous,\n\n24:01.400 --> 24:03.760\n not to do it as a real identity,\n\n24:03.760 --> 24:05.120\n but to do it as pseudonym,\n\n24:05.120 --> 24:07.600\n because I think it builds tangibility\n\n24:07.600 --> 24:12.600\n and a little bit of empathy that this was a human\n\n24:13.400 --> 24:14.680\n or a set of humans behind it.\n\n24:14.680 --> 24:19.680\n And there's this natural identity that I can imagine.\n\n24:19.680 --> 24:22.440\n But there is also a sacrifice of ego.\n\n24:22.440 --> 24:23.680\n That's a pretty powerful thing\n\n24:23.680 --> 24:25.360\n from your perspective. Yeah, which is beautiful.\n\n24:25.360 --> 24:28.760\n Would you do, sort of philosophically,\n\n24:28.760 --> 24:29.800\n to ask you the question,\n\n24:29.800 --> 24:32.920\n would you do all the same things you're doing now\n\n24:32.920 --> 24:35.000\n if your name wasn't attached to it?\n\n24:35.000 --> 24:39.320\n Sort of, if you had to sacrifice the ego,\n\n24:39.320 --> 24:41.960\n put another way, is your ego deeply tied\n\n24:41.960 --> 24:43.880\n in the decisions you've been making?\n\n24:44.920 --> 24:45.760\n I hope not.\n\n24:45.760 --> 24:49.240\n I mean, I believe I would certainly attempt\n\n24:49.240 --> 24:51.440\n to do the things without my name having\n\n24:51.440 --> 24:53.400\n to be attached with it.\n\n24:53.400 --> 24:58.400\n But it's hard to do that in a corporation, legally.\n\n25:01.200 --> 25:02.600\n That's the issue.\n\n25:02.600 --> 25:05.200\n If I were to do more open source things,\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:10.200\n then absolutely, I don't need my particular identity,\n\n25:10.680 --> 25:12.600\n my real identity associated with it.\n\n25:12.600 --> 25:17.600\n But I think the appreciation that comes\n\n25:17.640 --> 25:21.000\n from doing something good and being able to see it\n\n25:21.000 --> 25:25.840\n and see people use it is pretty overwhelming and powerful,\n\n25:26.800 --> 25:29.920\n more so than maybe seeing your name in the headlines.\n\n25:29.920 --> 25:33.240\n Let's talk about artificial intelligence a little bit,\n\n25:33.240 --> 25:34.840\n if we could.\n\n25:34.840 --> 25:38.000\n 70 years ago, Alan Turing formulated the Turing test.\n\n25:38.000 --> 25:41.240\n To me, natural language is one of the most interesting\n\n25:41.240 --> 25:44.440\n spaces of problems that are tackled\n\n25:44.440 --> 25:45.600\n by artificial intelligence.\n\n25:45.600 --> 25:47.440\n It's the canonical problem of what it means\n\n25:47.440 --> 25:48.520\n to be intelligent.\n\n25:48.520 --> 25:50.720\n He formulated it as the Turing test.\n\n25:50.720 --> 25:53.320\n Let me ask sort of the broad question,\n\n25:53.320 --> 25:56.440\n how hard do you think is it to pass the Turing test\n\n25:56.440 --> 25:58.600\n in the space of language?\n\n25:58.600 --> 26:00.240\n Just from a very practical standpoint,\n\n26:00.240 --> 26:05.240\n I think where we are now and for at least years out\n\n26:07.080 --> 26:11.600\n is one where the artificial intelligence,\n\n26:11.600 --> 26:13.800\n machine learning, the deep learning models\n\n26:13.800 --> 26:17.280\n can bubble up interestingness very, very quickly\n\n26:17.280 --> 26:22.280\n and pair that with human discretion around severity,\n\n26:22.280 --> 26:27.280\n around depth, around nuance and meaning.\n\n26:27.760 --> 26:32.760\n I think for me, the chasm across for general intelligence\n\n26:33.120 --> 26:38.120\n is to be able to explain why and the meaning\n\n26:38.400 --> 26:40.160\n behind something.\n\n26:40.160 --> 26:42.000\n Behind a decision.\n\n26:42.000 --> 26:45.800\n Behind a decision or a set of data.\n\n26:45.800 --> 26:48.720\n So the explainability part is kind of essential\n\n26:48.720 --> 26:52.080\n to be able to explain the meaning behind something.\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:54.320\n To explain using natural language\n\n26:54.320 --> 26:56.600\n why the decisions were made, that kind of thing.\n\n26:56.600 --> 26:58.880\n Yeah, I mean I think that's one of our biggest risks\n\n26:58.880 --> 27:01.240\n in artificial intelligence going forward\n\n27:01.240 --> 27:03.560\n is we are building a lot of black boxes\n\n27:03.560 --> 27:06.840\n that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision\n\n27:06.840 --> 27:09.480\n or what criteria they used to make the decision.\n\n27:09.480 --> 27:11.160\n And we're trusting them more and more\n\n27:11.160 --> 27:14.720\n from lending decisions to content recommendation\n\n27:14.720 --> 27:18.120\n to driving to health.\n\n27:18.120 --> 27:20.880\n Like a lot of us have watches that tell us\n\n27:20.880 --> 27:23.120\n to understand how they're deciding that.\n\n27:23.120 --> 27:25.360\n I mean that one's pretty simple.\n\n27:25.360 --> 27:28.240\n But you can imagine how complex they get.\n\n27:28.240 --> 27:32.080\n And being able to explain the reasoning behind\n\n27:32.080 --> 27:34.960\n some of those recommendations seems to be an essential part.\n\n27:34.960 --> 27:35.800\n Although it's hard.\n\n27:35.800 --> 27:37.840\n Which is a very hard problem because sometimes\n\n27:37.840 --> 27:40.880\n even we can't explain why we make decisions.\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:42.720\n That's what I was, I think we're being sometimes\n\n27:42.720 --> 27:45.720\n a little bit unfair to artificial intelligence systems\n\n27:45.720 --> 27:48.280\n because we're not very good at some of these things.\n\n27:48.280 --> 27:52.600\n So do you think, apologize for the ridiculous\n\n27:52.600 --> 27:55.840\n romanticized question, but on that line of thought,\n\n27:55.840 --> 27:58.840\n do you think we'll ever be able to build a system\n\n28:00.280 --> 28:03.200\n like in the movie Her that you could fall in love with?\n\n28:03.200 --> 28:05.440\n So have that kind of deep connection with.\n\n28:06.360 --> 28:07.440\n Hasn't that already happened?\n\n28:07.440 --> 28:12.020\n Hasn't someone in Japan fallen in love with his AI?\n\n28:13.280 --> 28:14.840\n There's always going to be somebody\n\n28:14.840 --> 28:15.960\n that does that kind of thing.\n\n28:15.960 --> 28:19.280\n I mean at a much larger scale of actually building\n\n28:19.280 --> 28:21.640\n relationships, of being deeper connections.\n\n28:21.640 --> 28:24.120\n It doesn't have to be love, but it's just deeper connections\n\n28:24.120 --> 28:26.560\n with artificial intelligence systems.\n\n28:26.560 --> 28:27.400\n So you mentioned explainability.\n\n28:27.400 --> 28:29.800\n That's less a function of the artificial intelligence\n\n28:29.800 --> 28:32.240\n and more a function of the individual\n\n28:32.240 --> 28:34.680\n and how they find meaning and where they find meaning.\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:37.400\n Do you think we humans can find meaning in technology\n\n28:37.400 --> 28:38.240\n in this kind of way?\n\n28:38.240 --> 28:40.600\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%, 100%.\n\n28:40.600 --> 28:43.220\n And I don't necessarily think it's a negative.\n\n28:43.220 --> 28:48.220\n But it's constantly going to evolve.\n\n28:50.180 --> 28:54.460\n So I don't know, but meaning is something\n\n28:54.460 --> 28:56.240\n that's entirely subjective.\n\n28:56.240 --> 28:59.340\n And I don't think it's going to be a function\n\n28:59.340 --> 29:02.380\n of finding the magic algorithm\n\n29:02.380 --> 29:06.340\n that enables everyone to love it.\n\n29:07.420 --> 29:09.100\n But maybe, I don't know.\n\n29:09.100 --> 29:10.820\n That question really gets at the difference\n\n29:10.820 --> 29:12.700\n between human and machine.\n\n29:12.700 --> 29:16.220\n So you had a little bit of an exchange with Elon Musk.\n\n29:17.340 --> 29:20.140\n Basically, I mean it's a trivial version of that,\n\n29:20.140 --> 29:22.060\n but I think there's a more fundamental question\n\n29:22.060 --> 29:24.220\n of is it possible to tell the difference\n\n29:24.220 --> 29:27.260\n between a bot and a human?\n\n29:27.260 --> 29:31.420\n And do you think it's, if we look into the future,\n\n29:31.420 --> 29:34.060\n 10, 20 years out, do you think it would be possible\n\n29:34.060 --> 29:36.340\n or is it even necessary to tell the difference\n\n29:36.340 --> 29:40.380\n in the digital space between a human and a robot?\n\n29:40.380 --> 29:42.700\n Can we have fulfilling relationships with each\n\n29:42.700 --> 29:45.260\n or do we need to tell the difference between them?\n\n29:46.200 --> 29:49.340\n I think it's certainly useful in certain problem domains\n\n29:49.340 --> 29:51.040\n to be able to tell the difference.\n\n29:52.460 --> 29:56.500\n I think in others it might not be as useful.\n\n29:56.500 --> 29:58.180\n Do you think it's possible for us today\n\n29:58.180 --> 30:00.020\n to tell that difference?\n\n30:00.020 --> 30:02.860\n Is the reverse the meta of the Turing test?\n\n30:02.860 --> 30:07.060\n Well, what's interesting is I think the technology\n\n30:07.060 --> 30:10.660\n to create is moving much faster\n\n30:10.660 --> 30:13.500\n than the technology to detect, generally.\n\n30:13.500 --> 30:14.340\n You think so?\n\n30:14.340 --> 30:17.220\n So if you look at adversarial machine learning,\n\n30:17.220 --> 30:18.660\n there's a lot of systems that try\n\n30:18.660 --> 30:21.220\n to fool machine learning systems.\n\n30:21.220 --> 30:23.940\n And at least for me, the hope is that the technology\n\n30:23.940 --> 30:28.940\n to defend will always be right there, at least.\n\n30:28.940 --> 30:30.900\n Your sense is that...\n\n30:30.900 --> 30:31.980\n I don't know if they'll be right there.\n\n30:31.980 --> 30:34.140\n I mean, it's a race, right?\n\n30:34.140 --> 30:38.340\n So the detection technologies have to be two\n\n30:38.340 --> 30:42.100\n or 10 steps ahead of the creation technologies.\n\n30:42.100 --> 30:44.180\n This is a problem that I think the financial industry\n\n30:44.180 --> 30:48.460\n will face more and more because a lot of our risk models,\n\n30:48.460 --> 30:50.780\n for instance, are built around identity.\n\n30:50.780 --> 30:53.420\n Payments ultimately comes down to identity.\n\n30:53.420 --> 30:57.620\n And you can imagine a world where all this conversation\n\n30:57.620 --> 31:00.940\n around deep fakes goes towards the direction\n\n31:00.940 --> 31:05.940\n of a driver's license or passports or state identities.\n\n31:06.380 --> 31:09.260\n And people construct identities in order\n\n31:09.260 --> 31:11.900\n to get through a system such as ours\n\n31:11.900 --> 31:15.060\n to start accepting credit cards or into the cash app.\n\n31:15.940 --> 31:19.700\n And those technologies seem to be moving very, very quickly.\n\n31:19.700 --> 31:22.820\n Our ability to detect them, I think,\n\n31:22.820 --> 31:25.060\n is probably lagging at this point,\n\n31:25.060 --> 31:29.820\n but certainly with more focus, we can get ahead of it.\n\n31:29.820 --> 31:33.980\n But this is gonna touch everything.\n\n31:33.980 --> 31:38.500\n So I think it's like security.\n\n31:38.500 --> 31:39.780\n We're never going to be able\n\n31:39.780 --> 31:42.940\n to build a perfect detection system.\n\n31:42.940 --> 31:45.620\n We're only going to be able to...\n\n31:45.620 --> 31:50.540\n What we should be focused on is the speed of evolving it\n\n31:50.540 --> 31:55.540\n and being able to take signals that show correctness\n\n31:55.540 --> 31:58.260\n or errors as quickly as possible\n\n31:58.260 --> 32:01.500\n and move and to be able to build that\n\n32:01.500 --> 32:04.940\n into our newer models or the self learning models.\n\n32:04.940 --> 32:06.020\n Do you have other worries?\n\n32:06.020 --> 32:07.900\n Like some people, like Elon and others,\n\n32:07.900 --> 32:10.340\n have worries of existential threats\n\n32:10.340 --> 32:11.620\n of artificial intelligence,\n\n32:11.620 --> 32:13.700\n of artificial general intelligence?\n\n32:13.700 --> 32:17.060\n Or if you think more narrowly about threats\n\n32:17.060 --> 32:20.300\n and concerns about more narrow artificial intelligence,\n\n32:20.300 --> 32:23.780\n like what are your thoughts in this domain?\n\n32:23.780 --> 32:26.580\n Do you have concerns or are you more optimistic?\n\n32:26.580 --> 32:29.100\n I think Yuval in his book,\n\n32:29.100 --> 32:31.980\n 21 Lessons for the 21st Century,\n\n32:31.980 --> 32:34.940\n his last chapter is around meditation.\n\n32:34.940 --> 32:37.140\n And you look at the title of the chapter\n\n32:37.140 --> 32:39.700\n and you're like, oh, it's all meditation.\n\n32:39.700 --> 32:42.660\n But what was interesting about that chapter\n\n32:42.660 --> 32:47.660\n is he believes that kids being born today,\n\n32:48.740 --> 32:53.740\n growing up today, Google has a stronger sense\n\n32:53.740 --> 32:56.300\n of their preferences than they do,\n\n32:57.300 --> 32:59.260\n which you can easily imagine.\n\n32:59.260 --> 33:04.260\n I can easily imagine today that Google probably knows\n\n33:04.420 --> 33:07.300\n my preferences more than my mother does.\n\n33:08.300 --> 33:12.500\n Maybe not me per se, but for someone growing up\n\n33:12.500 --> 33:13.340\n only knowing the internet,\n\n33:13.340 --> 33:16.500\n only knowing what Google is capable of,\n\n33:16.500 --> 33:20.060\n or Facebook or Twitter or Square or any of these things,\n\n33:20.060 --> 33:25.060\n the self awareness is being offloaded to other systems\n\n33:25.580 --> 33:28.180\n and particularly these algorithms.\n\n33:28.180 --> 33:32.220\n And his concern is that we lose that self awareness\n\n33:32.220 --> 33:35.220\n because the self awareness is now outside of us\n\n33:35.220 --> 33:37.060\n and it's doing such a better job\n\n33:37.060 --> 33:41.380\n at helping us direct our decisions around,\n\n33:41.380 --> 33:43.700\n should I stand, should I walk today?\n\n33:43.700 --> 33:45.300\n What doctor should I choose?\n\n33:45.300 --> 33:46.620\n Who should I date?\n\n33:46.620 --> 33:50.420\n All these things we're now seeing play out very quickly.\n\n33:50.420 --> 33:54.780\n So he sees meditation as a tool to build that self awareness\n\n33:54.780 --> 33:56.860\n and to bring the focus back on,\n\n33:56.860 --> 33:58.500\n why do I make these decisions?\n\n33:58.500 --> 34:00.100\n Why do I react in this way?\n\n34:00.100 --> 34:02.740\n Why did I have this thought?\n\n34:02.740 --> 34:04.140\n Where did that come from?\n\n34:04.140 --> 34:05.740\n That's a way to regain control.\n\n34:07.140 --> 34:10.140\n Or awareness, maybe not control, but awareness\n\n34:10.140 --> 34:13.300\n so that you can be aware that yes, I am,\n\n34:13.300 --> 34:15.500\n I am, I am, I am, I am.\n\n34:15.500 --> 34:19.780\n Yes, I am offloading this decision to this algorithm\n\n34:19.780 --> 34:21.660\n that I don't fully understand\n\n34:21.660 --> 34:24.580\n and can't tell me why it's doing the things it's doing\n\n34:24.580 --> 34:26.740\n because it's so complex.\n\n34:26.740 --> 34:29.060\n That's not to say that the algorithm can't be a good thing.\n\n34:29.060 --> 34:31.340\n And to me recommender systems,\n\n34:31.340 --> 34:34.940\n the best of what they can do is to help guide you\n\n34:34.940 --> 34:39.700\n on a journey of learning new ideas of learning period.\n\n34:39.700 --> 34:41.860\n It can be a great thing, but do you know you're doing that?\n\n34:41.860 --> 34:45.540\n Are you aware that you're inviting it to do that to you?\n\n34:45.540 --> 34:48.540\n I think that's the risk he identifies, right?\n\n34:50.100 --> 34:51.700\n That's perfectly okay.\n\n34:51.700 --> 34:55.700\n But are you aware that you have that invitation\n\n34:55.700 --> 34:58.460\n and it's being acted upon?\n\n34:58.460 --> 35:02.460\n And so that's a concern you're kind of highlighting\n\n35:02.460 --> 35:04.660\n that without a lack of awareness,\n\n35:04.660 --> 35:06.300\n you can just be like floating at sea.\n\n35:06.300 --> 35:08.900\n So awareness is key in the future\n\n35:08.900 --> 35:10.860\n of these artificial intelligence systems.\n\n35:10.860 --> 35:12.460\n Yeah, the movie WALLY.\n\n35:12.460 --> 35:13.300\n WALLY.\n\n35:13.300 --> 35:15.340\n Which I think is one of Pixar's best movies\n\n35:15.340 --> 35:17.100\n besides RATATOUILLI.\n\n35:19.340 --> 35:20.660\n RATATOUILLI was incredible.\n\n35:20.660 --> 35:22.220\n You had me until RATATOUILLI, okay.\n\n35:22.220 --> 35:23.620\n RATATOUILLI was incredible.\n\n35:26.180 --> 35:28.140\n All right, we've come to the first point\n\n35:28.140 --> 35:29.140\n where we disagree, okay.\n\n35:29.140 --> 35:31.940\n It's the entrepreneurial story in the form of a rat.\n\n35:35.780 --> 35:38.660\n I just remember just the soundtrack was really good, so.\n\n35:38.660 --> 35:41.020\n Excellent.\n\n35:41.020 --> 35:43.780\n What are your thoughts, sticking on artificial intelligence\n\n35:43.780 --> 35:45.980\n a little bit, about the displacement of jobs?\n\n35:45.980 --> 35:48.220\n That's another perspective that candidates\n\n35:48.220 --> 35:50.180\n like Andrew Yang talk about.\n\n35:50.180 --> 35:51.220\n Yang gang forever.\n\n35:53.100 --> 35:54.100\n Yang gang.\n\n35:54.100 --> 35:56.300\n So he unfortunately, speaking of Yang gang,\n\n35:56.300 --> 35:57.580\n has recently dropped out.\n\n35:57.580 --> 36:00.180\n I know, it was very disappointing and depressing.\n\n36:00.180 --> 36:02.180\n Yeah, but on the positive side,\n\n36:02.180 --> 36:05.300\n he's I think launching a podcast, so.\n\n36:05.300 --> 36:06.180\n Really, cool.\n\n36:06.180 --> 36:07.940\n Yeah, he just announced that.\n\n36:07.940 --> 36:09.900\n I'm sure he'll try to talk you into trying\n\n36:09.900 --> 36:11.060\n to come on to the podcast.\n\n36:11.060 --> 36:12.060\n I will talk to him.\n\n36:12.060 --> 36:13.260\n So. About RATATOUILLI.\n\n36:14.580 --> 36:16.100\n Yeah, maybe he'll be more welcoming\n\n36:16.100 --> 36:18.220\n of the RATATOUILLI argument.\n\n36:18.220 --> 36:20.260\n What are your thoughts on his concerns\n\n36:20.260 --> 36:22.180\n of the displacement of jobs, of automations,\n\n36:22.180 --> 36:24.940\n of the, of course there's positive impacts\n\n36:24.940 --> 36:26.660\n that could come from automation and AI,\n\n36:26.660 --> 36:29.300\n but there could also be negative impacts.\n\n36:29.300 --> 36:31.500\n And within that framework, what are your thoughts\n\n36:31.500 --> 36:33.420\n about universal basic income?\n\n36:33.420 --> 36:36.020\n So these interesting new ideas\n\n36:36.020 --> 36:39.340\n of how we can empower people in the economy.\n\n36:40.380 --> 36:45.380\n I think he was 100% right on almost every dimension.\n\n36:46.660 --> 36:48.660\n We see this in Square's business.\n\n36:48.660 --> 36:52.180\n I mean, he identified truck drivers.\n\n36:52.180 --> 36:53.100\n I'm from Missouri.\n\n36:54.180 --> 36:59.180\n And he certainly pointed to the concern\n\n37:00.540 --> 37:04.340\n and the issue that people from where I'm from\n\n37:04.340 --> 37:07.700\n feel every single day that is often invisible\n\n37:07.700 --> 37:09.500\n and not talked about enough.\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:12.020\n You know, the next big one is cashiers.\n\n37:12.020 --> 37:14.380\n This is where it pertains to Square's business.\n\n37:15.700 --> 37:19.740\n We are seeing more and more of the point of sale\n\n37:19.740 --> 37:22.940\n move to the individual customer's hand\n\n37:22.940 --> 37:24.500\n in the form of their phone and apps\n\n37:24.500 --> 37:27.260\n and preorder and order ahead.\n\n37:27.260 --> 37:29.620\n We're seeing more kiosks.\n\n37:29.620 --> 37:32.300\n We're seeing more things like Amazon Go.\n\n37:32.300 --> 37:37.300\n And the number of workers as a cashier in retail is immense.\n\n37:40.340 --> 37:43.620\n And, you know, there's no real answers\n\n37:43.620 --> 37:47.940\n on how they transform their skills\n\n37:47.940 --> 37:51.140\n and work into something else.\n\n37:51.140 --> 37:53.100\n And I think that does lead to a lot\n\n37:53.100 --> 37:56.140\n of really negative ramifications.\n\n37:56.140 --> 37:59.020\n And the important point that he brought up\n\n37:59.020 --> 38:01.460\n around universal basic income\n\n38:01.460 --> 38:03.540\n is given that the shift is going to come\n\n38:04.900 --> 38:07.540\n and given it is going to take time\n\n38:07.540 --> 38:12.540\n to set people up with new skills and new careers,\n\n38:14.860 --> 38:17.700\n they need to have a floor to be able to survive.\n\n38:17.700 --> 38:22.620\n And this $1,000 a month is such a floor.\n\n38:22.620 --> 38:25.100\n It's not going to incentivize you to quit your job\n\n38:25.100 --> 38:26.620\n because it's not enough,\n\n38:26.620 --> 38:30.220\n but it will enable you to not have to worry\n\n38:30.220 --> 38:35.220\n as much about just getting on day to day\n\n38:35.860 --> 38:39.860\n so that you can focus on what am I going to do now\n\n38:39.860 --> 38:44.860\n and what am I going to, what skills do I need to acquire?\n\n38:44.860 --> 38:48.740\n And I think, you know, a lot of people point\n\n38:48.740 --> 38:53.260\n to the fact that, you know, during the industrial age,\n\n38:53.260 --> 38:55.780\n we had the same concerns around automation,\n\n38:55.780 --> 38:59.220\n factory lines and everything worked out okay.\n\n38:59.220 --> 39:04.220\n But the biggest change is just the velocity\n\n39:04.340 --> 39:08.060\n and the centralization of a lot of the things\n\n39:08.060 --> 39:10.900\n that make this work, which is the data\n\n39:11.820 --> 39:14.900\n and the algorithms that work on this data.\n\n39:14.900 --> 39:18.900\n I think that the second biggest scary thing\n\n39:18.900 --> 39:23.900\n is just how around AI is just who actually owns the data\n\n39:24.820 --> 39:26.300\n and who can operate on it.\n\n39:26.300 --> 39:31.300\n And are we able to share the insights from the data\n\n39:32.940 --> 39:36.380\n so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs\n\n39:36.380 --> 39:39.140\n or help our business or whatnot?\n\n39:39.140 --> 39:43.500\n So that's where I think regulation could play\n\n39:43.500 --> 39:45.300\n a strong and positive part.\n\n39:46.540 --> 39:50.460\n First, looking at the primitives of AI\n\n39:50.460 --> 39:52.660\n and the tools we use to build these services\n\n39:52.660 --> 39:54.820\n that will ultimately touch every single aspect\n\n39:54.820 --> 39:56.540\n of the human experience.\n\n39:56.540 --> 40:01.540\n And then where data is owned and how it's shared.\n\n40:05.980 --> 40:10.540\n So those are the answers that as a society, as a world,\n\n40:10.540 --> 40:12.460\n we need to have better answers around,\n\n40:12.460 --> 40:13.860\n which we're currently not.\n\n40:13.860 --> 40:15.380\n They're just way too centralized\n\n40:15.380 --> 40:18.100\n into a few very, very large companies.\n\n40:19.580 --> 40:23.260\n But I think it was spot on with identifying the problem\n\n40:23.260 --> 40:25.860\n and proposing solutions that would actually work.\n\n40:26.780 --> 40:29.300\n At least that we learned from that you could expand\n\n40:29.300 --> 40:34.300\n or evolve, but I mean, I think UBI is well past its due.\n\n40:38.380 --> 40:41.620\n I mean, it was certainly trumpeted by Martin Luther King\n\n40:41.620 --> 40:43.820\n and even before him as well.\n\n40:44.820 --> 40:48.060\n And like you said, the exact $1,000 mark\n\n40:48.060 --> 40:50.260\n might not be the correct one,\n\n40:50.260 --> 40:54.020\n but you should take the steps to try to implement\n\n40:54.020 --> 40:56.260\n these solutions and see what works.\n\n40:56.260 --> 40:57.500\n 100%.\n\n40:57.500 --> 40:59.380\n So I think you and I eat similar diets,\n\n40:59.380 --> 41:01.740\n and at least I was.\n\n41:01.740 --> 41:04.180\n The first time I've heard this.\n\n41:04.180 --> 41:05.380\n Yeah, so I was doing it before.\n\n41:05.380 --> 41:08.620\n First time anyone has said that to me, in this case anyway.\n\n41:08.620 --> 41:11.040\n Yeah, but it's becoming more and more cool.\n\n41:12.140 --> 41:13.700\n But I was doing it before it was cool.\n\n41:13.700 --> 41:16.300\n So intermittent fasting and fasting in general,\n\n41:16.300 --> 41:18.700\n I really enjoy, I love food,\n\n41:18.700 --> 41:23.060\n but I enjoy the, I also love suffering because I'm Russian.\n\n41:23.060 --> 41:26.100\n So fasting kind of makes you appreciate the,\n\n41:29.580 --> 41:32.420\n makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow.\n\n41:33.540 --> 41:36.660\n But I have, outside the philosophical stuff,\n\n41:36.660 --> 41:37.900\n I have a more specific question.\n\n41:37.900 --> 41:41.980\n It also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker,\n\n41:41.980 --> 41:43.940\n like from the scientific perspective,\n\n41:43.940 --> 41:46.900\n to sit there for many hours and focus deeply.\n\n41:46.900 --> 41:50.900\n Maybe you were a hacker before you were CEO.\n\n41:50.900 --> 41:55.020\n What have you learned about diet, lifestyle,\n\n41:55.020 --> 41:57.940\n mindset that helps you maximize mental performance,\n\n41:57.940 --> 42:00.220\n to be able to focus for,\n\n42:00.220 --> 42:03.980\n to think deeply in this world of distractions?\n\n42:03.980 --> 42:07.220\n I think I just took it for granted for too long.\n\n42:08.380 --> 42:09.660\n Which aspect?\n\n42:09.660 --> 42:13.460\n Just the social structure of we eat three meals a day\n\n42:13.460 --> 42:15.140\n and there's snacks in between.\n\n42:15.140 --> 42:18.980\n And I just never really asked the question, why?\n\n42:18.980 --> 42:20.780\n Oh, by the way, in case people don't know,\n\n42:20.780 --> 42:22.100\n I think a lot of people know,\n\n42:22.100 --> 42:26.100\n but you at least, you famously eat once a day.\n\n42:26.100 --> 42:27.620\n You still eat once a day?\n\n42:27.620 --> 42:29.620\n Yep, I eat dinner.\n\n42:29.620 --> 42:32.060\n By the way, what made you decide to eat once a day?\n\n42:32.060 --> 42:33.980\n Like, cause to me that was a huge revolution\n\n42:33.980 --> 42:35.420\n that you don't have to eat breakfast.\n\n42:35.420 --> 42:37.380\n That was like, I felt like I was a rebel.\n\n42:37.380 --> 42:39.900\n Like I abandoned my parents or something\n\n42:39.900 --> 42:41.100\n and became an anarchist.\n\n42:41.100 --> 42:43.500\n When you first, like the first week you start doing it,\n\n42:43.500 --> 42:45.860\n it feels that you kind of like have a superpower.\n\n42:45.860 --> 42:47.660\n Then you realize it's not really a superpower.\n\n42:47.660 --> 42:50.100\n But it, I think you realize,\n\n42:50.100 --> 42:53.060\n at least I realized like it just how much is,\n\n42:53.060 --> 42:58.060\n how much our mind dictates what we're possible of.\n\n42:59.780 --> 43:02.260\n And sometimes we have structures around us\n\n43:02.260 --> 43:05.340\n that incentivize like, this three meal a day thing,\n\n43:05.340 --> 43:09.700\n which was purely social structure\n\n43:09.700 --> 43:14.180\n versus necessity for our health and for our bodies.\n\n43:14.180 --> 43:17.500\n And I did it just, I started doing it\n\n43:17.500 --> 43:21.540\n because I played a lot with my diet when I was a kid\n\n43:21.540 --> 43:23.340\n and I was vegan for two years\n\n43:23.340 --> 43:28.260\n and just went all over the place just because I,\n\n43:28.260 --> 43:31.180\n you know, health is the most precious thing we have\n\n43:31.180 --> 43:33.900\n and none of us really understand it.\n\n43:33.900 --> 43:37.980\n So being able to ask the question through experiments\n\n43:37.980 --> 43:39.460\n that I can perform on myself\n\n43:39.460 --> 43:44.140\n and learn about is compelling to me.\n\n43:44.140 --> 43:47.580\n And I heard this one guy on a podcast, Wim Hof,\n\n43:47.580 --> 43:50.900\n who's famous for doing ice baths and holding his breath\n\n43:50.900 --> 43:53.540\n and all these things.\n\n43:54.660 --> 43:56.580\n He said he only eats one meal a day.\n\n43:56.580 --> 43:59.180\n I'm like, wow, that sounds super challenging\n\n43:59.180 --> 44:00.700\n and uncomfortable.\n\n44:00.700 --> 44:02.020\n I'm gonna do it.\n\n44:02.020 --> 44:05.380\n So I just, I learn the most when I make myself,\n\n44:06.260 --> 44:07.460\n I wouldn't say suffer,\n\n44:07.460 --> 44:10.420\n but when I make myself feel uncomfortable\n\n44:10.420 --> 44:14.140\n because everything comes to bear in those moments\n\n44:14.140 --> 44:19.140\n and you really learn what you're about or what you're not.\n\n44:21.020 --> 44:23.940\n So I've been doing that my whole life.\n\n44:23.940 --> 44:25.780\n Like when I was a kid, I could not,\n\n44:25.780 --> 44:27.620\n like I was, I could not speak.\n\n44:27.620 --> 44:29.140\n Like I had to go to a speech therapist\n\n44:29.140 --> 44:31.940\n and it made me extremely shy.\n\n44:31.940 --> 44:34.860\n And then one day I realized I can't keep doing this\n\n44:34.860 --> 44:39.740\n and I signed up for the speech club.\n\n44:39.740 --> 44:44.740\n And it was the most uncomfortable thing\n\n44:45.060 --> 44:49.540\n I could imagine doing, getting a topic on a note card,\n\n44:49.540 --> 44:51.500\n having five minutes to write a speech\n\n44:51.500 --> 44:53.580\n about whatever that topic is,\n\n44:53.580 --> 44:56.620\n not being able to use the note card while speaking\n\n44:56.620 --> 44:59.420\n and speaking for five minutes about that topic.\n\n44:59.420 --> 45:03.940\n So, but it just, it puts so much,\n\n45:03.940 --> 45:06.220\n it gave me so much perspective\n\n45:06.220 --> 45:08.500\n around the power of communication,\n\n45:08.500 --> 45:10.020\n around my own deficiencies\n\n45:10.020 --> 45:14.140\n and around if I set my mind to do something, I'll do it.\n\n45:14.140 --> 45:16.420\n So it gave me a lot more confidence.\n\n45:16.420 --> 45:18.900\n So I see fasting in the same light.\n\n45:18.900 --> 45:21.460\n This is something that was interesting,\n\n45:21.460 --> 45:23.860\n challenging, uncomfortable,\n\n45:23.860 --> 45:28.860\n and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result.\n\n45:30.220 --> 45:32.620\n And it will lead to other things that I'll experiment with\n\n45:32.620 --> 45:35.820\n and play with, but yeah,\n\n45:35.820 --> 45:38.780\n it does feel a little bit like a superpower sometimes.\n\n45:39.820 --> 45:42.700\n The most boring superpower one can imagine.\n\n45:42.700 --> 45:44.060\n Now it's quite incredible.\n\n45:44.060 --> 45:46.820\n The clarity of mind is pretty interesting.\n\n45:47.660 --> 45:49.700\n Speaking of suffering,\n\n45:49.700 --> 45:53.060\n you kind of talk about facing difficult ideas.\n\n45:53.060 --> 45:58.060\n You meditate, you think about the broad context of life,\n\n45:58.940 --> 46:00.300\n of our societies.\n\n46:00.300 --> 46:02.500\n Let me ask, sort of apologize again\n\n46:02.500 --> 46:03.700\n for the romanticized question,\n\n46:03.700 --> 46:06.500\n but do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n46:06.500 --> 46:09.940\n Do you think about death,\n\n46:09.940 --> 46:13.780\n about the finiteness of human existence\n\n46:13.780 --> 46:15.420\n when you meditate, when you think about it?\n\n46:15.420 --> 46:18.020\n And if you do, what,\n\n46:18.020 --> 46:20.540\n how do you make sense of it, that this thing ends?\n\n46:22.460 --> 46:23.740\n Well, I don't try to make sense of it.\n\n46:23.740 --> 46:25.500\n I do think about it every day.\n\n46:25.500 --> 46:29.060\n I mean, it's a daily, multiple times a day.\n\n46:29.060 --> 46:30.540\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n46:30.540 --> 46:32.380\n No, I'm not afraid of it.\n\n46:32.380 --> 46:36.300\n I think it's a transformation, I don't know to what,\n\n46:36.300 --> 46:38.180\n but it's also a tool\n\n46:39.260 --> 46:44.260\n to feel the importance of every moment.\n\n46:44.620 --> 46:48.620\n So I just use it as a reminder, like I have an hour.\n\n46:48.620 --> 46:51.380\n Is this really what I'm going to spend the hour doing?\n\n46:52.300 --> 46:55.460\n Like I only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch.\n\n46:55.460 --> 46:58.300\n Like I'm not going to get up for it.\n\n46:58.300 --> 47:02.060\n I'm not going to make sure that I try to see it.\n\n47:02.060 --> 47:06.660\n So it just puts a lot into perspective\n\n47:06.660 --> 47:09.060\n and it helps me prioritize.\n\n47:09.060 --> 47:12.500\n I think it's, I don't see it as something that's like\n\n47:13.780 --> 47:15.500\n that I dread or is dreadful.\n\n47:15.500 --> 47:18.060\n It's a tool that is available\n\n47:18.060 --> 47:19.660\n to every single person to use every day\n\n47:19.660 --> 47:21.780\n because it shows how precious life is.\n\n47:21.780 --> 47:24.540\n And there's reminders every single day,\n\n47:24.540 --> 47:27.940\n whether it be your own health or a friend or a coworker\n\n47:27.940 --> 47:29.620\n or something you see in the news.\n\n47:30.620 --> 47:32.380\n So to me it's just a question\n\n47:32.380 --> 47:34.820\n of what we do with our daily reminder.\n\n47:34.820 --> 47:39.820\n And for me, it's am I really focused on what matters?\n\n47:40.180 --> 47:42.220\n And sometimes that might be work,\n\n47:42.220 --> 47:45.180\n sometimes that might be friendships or family\n\n47:45.180 --> 47:47.020\n or relationships or whatnot,\n\n47:47.020 --> 47:51.300\n but it's the ultimate clarifier in that sense.\n\n47:51.300 --> 47:53.620\n So on the question of what matters,\n\n47:53.620 --> 47:57.060\n another ridiculously big question of\n\n47:57.060 --> 47:58.460\n once you try to make sense of it,\n\n47:58.460 --> 48:00.700\n what do you think is the meaning of it all,\n\n48:00.700 --> 48:02.020\n the meaning of life?\n\n48:02.020 --> 48:07.020\n What gives you purpose, happiness, meaning?\n\n48:07.660 --> 48:08.500\n A lot does.\n\n48:08.500 --> 48:11.500\n I mean, just being able to be aware\n\n48:14.340 --> 48:18.580\n of the fact that I'm alive is pretty meaningful.\n\n48:20.060 --> 48:23.060\n The connections I feel with individuals,\n\n48:23.060 --> 48:25.060\n whether they're people I just meet\n\n48:25.060 --> 48:29.940\n or long lasting friendships or my family is meaningful.\n\n48:30.900 --> 48:33.740\n Seeing people use something that I helped build\n\n48:33.740 --> 48:36.300\n is really meaningful and powerful to me.\n\n48:38.820 --> 48:40.300\n But that sense of, I mean,\n\n48:40.300 --> 48:43.460\n I think ultimately it comes down to a sense of connection\n\n48:43.460 --> 48:47.220\n and just feeling like I am bigger,\n\n48:47.220 --> 48:49.940\n I am part of something that's bigger than myself\n\n48:49.940 --> 48:52.180\n and like I can feel it directly\n\n48:52.180 --> 48:54.020\n in small ways or large ways,\n\n48:54.020 --> 48:58.260\n however it manifests is probably it.\n\n48:59.700 --> 49:00.700\n Last question.\n\n49:00.700 --> 49:02.860\n Do you think we're living in a simulation?\n\n49:05.900 --> 49:06.740\n I don't know.\n\n49:06.740 --> 49:08.100\n It's a pretty fun one if we are,\n\n49:09.060 --> 49:14.020\n but also crazy and random and wrought with tons of problems.\n\n49:15.580 --> 49:17.260\n But yeah.\n\n49:17.260 --> 49:19.420\n Would you have it any other way?\n\n49:19.420 --> 49:20.260\n Yeah.\n\n49:20.260 --> 49:24.580\n I mean, I just think it's taken us way too long\n\n49:24.580 --> 49:27.180\n as a planet to realize we're all in this together\n\n49:27.180 --> 49:32.180\n and we all are connected in very significant ways.\n\n49:34.100 --> 49:38.940\n I think we hide our connectivity very well through ego,\n\n49:38.940 --> 49:42.060\n through whatever it is of the day.\n\n49:42.060 --> 49:46.260\n But that is the one thing I would wanna work\n\n49:46.260 --> 49:51.260\n towards changing and that's how I would have it another way.\n\n49:51.540 --> 49:52.900\n Cause if we can't do that,\n\n49:52.900 --> 49:55.620\n then how are we gonna connect to all the other simulations?\n\n49:55.620 --> 49:57.380\n Cause that's the next step is like\n\n49:57.380 --> 49:58.860\n what's happening in the other simulation.\n\n49:58.860 --> 50:01.140\n Escaping this one and yeah.\n\n50:03.380 --> 50:05.500\n Spanning across the multiple simulations\n\n50:05.500 --> 50:07.380\n and sharing in and on the fun.\n\n50:07.380 --> 50:09.940\n I don't think there's a better way to end it.\n\n50:09.940 --> 50:12.060\n Jack, thank you so much for all the work you do.\n\n50:12.060 --> 50:13.940\n There's probably other ways that we've ended this\n\n50:13.940 --> 50:16.620\n and other simulations that may have been better.\n\n50:16.620 --> 50:18.740\n We'll have to wait and see.\n\n50:18.740 --> 50:19.900\n Thanks so much for talking today.\n\n50:19.900 --> 50:20.740\n Thank you.\n\n50:21.620 --> 50:24.180\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jack Dorsey\n\n50:24.180 -->

Bitcoin from Paul Graham.\n\n50:50.540 --> 50:52.580\n I'm very intrigued by Bitcoin.\n\n50:52.580 --> 50:55.100\n It has all the signs of a paradigm shift.\n\n50:55.100 --> 50:58.900\n Hackers love it, yet it is described as a toy,\n\n50:58.900 --> 51:01.020\n just like microcomputers.\n\n51:01.020 --> 51:14.020\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
