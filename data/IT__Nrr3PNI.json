language, which in many indices is the\n\n00:07.920 --> 00:12.600\n most popular programming language in the world, or is always at least in the top\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:13.360\n two or three.\n\n00:14.080 --> 00:17.320\n We only had a limited time for this conversation, but I'm sure we'll talk\n\n00:17.320 --> 00:19.080\n again several times in this podcast.\n\n00:19.880 --> 00:24.360\n Quick summary of the sponsors, Public Goods, BetterHelp, and ExpressVPN.\n\n00:24.800 --> 00:27.440\n Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount\n\n00:27.440 --> 00:29.280\n and to support this podcast.\n\n00:29.280 --> 00:34.080\n As a side note, let me say that Java is the language with which I first learned\n\n00:34.120 --> 00:38.560\n object oriented programming, and with it, the art and science of software\n\n00:38.560 --> 00:39.160\n engineering.\n\n00:39.680 --> 00:45.080\n Also early on in my undergraduate education, I took a course on concurrent\n\n00:45.080 --> 00:46.480\n programming with Java.\n\n00:47.240 --> 00:52.120\n Looking back at that time, before I fell in love with neural networks, the art\n\n00:52.160 --> 00:56.080\n of parallel computing was both algorithmically and philosophically\n\n00:56.080 --> 00:57.240\n fascinating to me.\n\n00:57.240 --> 01:01.560\n The concept of a computer in my mind before then was something that does\n\n01:01.560 --> 01:05.880\n one thing at a time, the idea that we could create an abstraction of\n\n01:05.880 --> 01:09.640\n parallelism where you could do many things at the same time, while still\n\n01:09.640 --> 01:12.800\n guaranteeing stability and correctness, was beautiful.\n\n01:13.720 --> 01:18.560\n While some folks in college took drugs to expand their mind, I took concurrent\n\n01:18.560 --> 01:19.160\n programming.\n\n01:19.840 --> 01:23.280\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it with five stars on\n\n01:23.280 --> 01:27.640\n Apple

no ads in the middle.\n\n01:33.640 --> 01:37.440\n I try to make these interesting, but I do give you timestamps, so go ahead\n\n01:37.440 --> 01:41.320\n and skip, but please do check out the sponsors by clicking the links in the\n\n01:41.320 --> 01:42.000\n description.\n\n01:42.320 --> 01:44.800\n It's the best way to support this podcast.\n\n01:45.800 --> 01:50.040\n This show sponsored by Public Goods, the one stop shop for affordable,\n\n01:50.040 --> 01:53.040\n sustainable, healthy household products.\n\n01:53.520 --> 01:56.800\n I take their fish oil and use their toothbrush, for example.\n\n01:57.400 --> 02:00.880\n Their products often have a minimalist black and white design that I find\n\n02:00.880 --> 02:02.000\n to be just beautiful.\n\n02:02.480 --> 02:05.400\n Some people ask why I wear this black suit and tie.\n\n02:06.080 --> 02:10.560\n There's a simplicity to it that to me focuses my mind on the most important\n\n02:10.560 --> 02:15.560\n bits of every moment of every day, pulling only at the thread of the\n\n02:15.560 --> 02:18.360\n essential in all that life has to throw at me.\n\n02:18.360 --> 02:20.600\n It's not about how I look, it's about how I feel.\n\n02:21.000 --> 02:24.960\n That's what design is to me, creating an inner conscious experience,\n\n02:24.960 --> 02:26.400\n not an external look.\n\n02:27.240 --> 02:32.520\n Anyway,

with the person on there and enjoy it.\n\n02:57.200 --> 03:02.320\n Of course, I also regularly talk to David Goggins these days, who is definitely not\n\n03:02.320 --> 03:08.840\n a licensed professional therapist, but he does help me meet his and my demons and\n\n03:08.840 --> 03:11.400\n become comfortable to exist in their presence.\n\n03:11.400 --> 03:16.320\n Everyone is different, but for me, I think suffering is essential for creation, but\n\n03:16.320 --> 03:19.440\n you can suffer beautifully in a way that doesn't destroy you.\n\n03:20.160 --> 03:23.600\n I think therapy can help in whatever form that therapy takes.\n\n03:24.000 --> 03:26.680\n And I do think that BetterHelp is an option worth trying.\n\n03:27.720 --> 03:31.280\n They're easy, private, affordable, and

available in other countries.\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:52.200\n I did this recently with Star Trek Discovery and UK Netflix, mostly because\n\n03:52.200 --> 03:54.240\n I wonder what it's like to live in London.\n\n03:54.800 --> 03:57.720\n I'm thinking of moving from Boston to a place where I can build the\n\n03:57.720 --> 03:59.720\n business I've always dreamed of building.\n\n04:00.200 --> 04:03.960\n London is probably not in the top three, but top 10 for sure.\n\n04:04.680 --> 04:08.000\n The number one show I've been to is the one that I'm most excited about.\n\n04:08.000 --> 04:11.160\n The number one choice currently is Austin.\n\n04:11.640 --> 04:14.200\n For many reasons that I'll probably speak to another time.\n\n04:14.800 --> 04:18.880\n San Francisco, unfortunately dropped out from the number one spot,\n\n04:18.880 --> 04:19.920\n but it's still in the running.\n\n04:20.600 --> 04:22.000\n If you have advice, let me know.\n\n04:22.960 --> 04:24.640\n Anyway,

with James Gosling.\n\n04:44.680 --> 04:49.000\n I've read somewhere that the square root of two is your favorite irrational number.\n\n04:49.080 --> 04:51.240\n I have no idea where that got started.\n\n04:53.440 --> 04:54.600\n Is there any truth to it?\n\n04:54.600 --> 04:57.640\n Is there anything in mathematics or numbers that you find beautiful?\n\n04:58.400 --> 05:03.120\n Oh, well, there's lots of things in math that's really beautiful.\n\n05:03.120 --> 05:07.960\n I used to consider myself really good at math and these days I consider\n\n05:07.960 --> 05:09.600\n myself really bad at math.\n\n05:11.040 --> 05:16.880\n I never really had a thing for the square root of two, but when I was a teenager,\n\n05:18.480 --> 05:23.360\n there was this book called The Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers,\n\n05:23.360 --> 05:31.360\n which for some reason I read through and damn near memorized the whole thing.\n\n05:33.040 --> 05:43.120\n And I started this weird habit of when I was like filling out checks or paying for things\n\n05:43.120 --> 05:49.840\n with credit cards, I would want to make the receipt add up to a new number.\n\n05:49.840 --> 05:53.440\n Is there some numbers that stuck with you that just kind of make you feel good?\n\n05:54.320 --> 06:00.240\n They all have a story and fortunately, I've actually mostly forgotten all of them.\n\n06:02.800 --> 06:08.720\n Are they, uh, so like 42, uh, well, yeah, I mean, that one 42 is pretty magical.\n\n06:08.880 --> 06:12.880\n And then the irrationals, I mean, but is there a square root of two story in there\n\n06:12.880 --> 06:14.720\n somewhere, how did that come about?\n\n06:14.720 --> 06:22.640\n It's, it's like the only number that has destroyed a religion in which way, well,\n\n06:22.640 --> 06:28.160\n the, the pathogorians, they, they believed that all numbers were perfect and you\n\n06:28.160 --> 06:33.040\n could re represent anything as, as a, as a rational number.\n\n06:33.040 --> 06:43.600\n And, um, in that, in that time period, um, the, this proof came out that there was no,\n\n06:44.720 --> 06:49.520\n you know, rational fraction whose value was equal to the square root of two.\n\n06:50.720 --> 06:54.320\n And that, that means nothing in this world, right?\n\n06:54.320 --> 06:54.640\n Yeah.\n\n06:54.640 --> 07:02.800\n So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,\n\n07:02.800 --> 07:05.040\n in this world is perfect, not even mathematics.\n\n07:05.600 --> 07:10.160\n Well, it means that your definition of perfect was imperfect.\n\n07:11.280 --> 07:14.640\n Well then, then there's the Gaitl incompleteness theorems and the 20th\n\n07:14.640 --> 07:17.360\n century that ruined it once again for everybody.\n\n07:17.360 --> 07:17.840\n Yeah.\n\n07:17.840 --> 07:25.360\n Although, although, although Goerl's theorem, um, you know, the lesson I take\n\n07:25.360 --> 07:29.920\n from Goerl's theorem is not that, you know, there are things you can't know,\n\n07:29.920 --> 07:33.740\n which is fundamentally what it says.\n\n07:35.920 --> 07:39.360\n But people want black and white answers.\n\n07:39.360 --> 07:40.720\n They want true or false.\n\n07:43.540 --> 07:48.000\n But if you allow a three state logic\n\n07:48.000 --> 07:50.040\n that is true, false, or maybe,\n\n07:51.860 --> 07:54.000\n then life's good.\n\n07:55.360 --> 07:58.660\n I feel like there's a parallel to modern political discourse\n\n07:58.660 --> 08:02.800\n in there somewhere, but let me ask.\n\n08:04.160 --> 08:09.160\n So with your kind of early love or appreciation\n\n08:10.100 --> 08:11.480\n of the beauty of mathematics,\n\n08:11.480 --> 08:15.000\n do you see a parallel between that world\n\n08:15.000 --> 08:16.720\n and the world of programming?\n\n08:17.920 --> 08:21.960\n Programming is all about logical structure,\n\n08:21.960 --> 08:26.960\n understanding the patterns that come out of computation,\n\n08:32.680 --> 08:37.680\n understanding sort of, I mean, it's often like the path\n\n08:38.880 --> 08:43.880\n through the graph of possibilities to find a short route.\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:48.320\n Meaning like find a short program\n\n08:48.320 --> 08:50.960\n that gets the job done kind of thing.\n\n08:50.960 --> 08:54.560\n But so then on the topic of irrational numbers,\n\n08:54.560 --> 08:58.640\n do you see programming?\n\n08:58.640 --> 09:01.260\n You just painted it so cleanly.\n\n09:01.260 --> 09:02.880\n It's a little of this trajectory\n\n09:02.880 --> 09:05.200\n to find like a nice little program,\n\n09:05.200 --> 09:07.520\n but do you see it as fundamentally messy?\n\n09:08.880 --> 09:10.840\n Maybe unlike mathematics?\n\n09:10.840 --> 09:13.740\n I don't think of it as, I mean, you know,\n\n09:13.740 --> 09:16.820\n you watch somebody who's good at math do math\n\n09:16.820 --> 09:21.820\n and you know, often it's fairly messy.\n\n09:22.480 --> 09:25.180\n Sometimes it's kind of magical.\n\n09:27.680 --> 09:32.680\n When I was a grad student, one of the students,\n\n09:32.920 --> 09:37.920\n his name was Jim Sachs, was he had this reputation\n\n09:37.920 --> 09:42.920\n of being sort of a walking, talking human\n\n09:46.920 --> 09:48.420\n theorem proving machine.\n\n09:49.280 --> 09:51.520\n And if you were having a hard problem with something,\n\n09:51.520 --> 09:54.260\n you could just like accost him in the hall\n\n09:54.260 --> 09:59.260\n and say, Jim, and he would do this funny thing\n\n09:59.740 --> 10:01.840\n where he would stand up straight.\n\n10:01.840 --> 10:03.560\n His eyes would kind of defocus.\n\n10:03.560 --> 10:08.560\n He'd go, you know, just like something in today's movies.\n\n10:10.880 --> 10:13.920\n And then he'd straighten up and say n log n and walk away.\n\n10:15.800 --> 10:20.520\n And you'd go, well, okay, so n log n is the answer.\n\n10:20.520 --> 10:21.960\n How did he get there?\n\n10:24.240 --> 10:27.120\n By which time he's, you know, down the hallway somewhere.\n\n10:27.120 --> 10:30.280\n Yeah, he's just the oracle, the black box\n\n10:30.280 --> 10:31.360\n that just gives you the answer.\n\n10:31.360 --> 10:33.360\n Yeah, and then you have to figure out the path\n\n10:33.360 --> 10:35.340\n from the question to the answer.\n\n10:36.440 --> 10:38.160\n I think in one of the videos I watched,\n\n10:38.160 --> 10:43.160\n you mentioned Don Knuth, well, at least recommending his,\n\n10:44.560 --> 10:47.800\n you know, his book is something people should read.\n\n10:47.800 --> 10:48.640\n Oh, yeah.\n\n10:48.640 --> 10:52.340\n But in terms of, you know, theoretical computer science,\n\n10:53.920 --> 10:58.400\n do you see something beautiful that has been inspiring\n\n10:58.400 --> 11:01.360\n to you, speaking of n log n, in your work\n\n11:01.360 --> 11:06.040\n on programming languages, that's in that whole world\n\n11:06.040 --> 11:10.240\n of algorithms and complexity and, you know,\n\n11:10.240 --> 11:13.520\n these kinds of more formal mathematical things?\n\n11:13.520 --> 11:16.720\n Or did that not really stick with you\n\n11:16.720 --> 11:18.760\n in your programming life?\n\n11:20.040 --> 11:24.080\n It did stick pretty clearly for me,\n\n11:24.080 --> 11:27.040\n because one of the things that I care about\n\n11:27.040 --> 11:32.040\n is being able to sort of look at a piece of code\n\n11:34.240 --> 11:39.180\n and be able to prove to myself that it works.\n\n11:41.360 --> 11:46.360\n And, you know, so for example, I find that I'm at odds\n\n11:51.440 --> 11:55.440\n with many of the people around me over issues\n\n11:55.440 --> 12:00.440\n about like how you lay out a piece of software, right?\n\n12:03.400 --> 12:07.600\n You know, so software engineers get really cranky\n\n12:07.600 --> 12:11.380\n about how they format the documents that are the programs,\n\n12:11.380 --> 12:14.280\n you know, where they put new lines and where they put,\n\n12:14.280 --> 12:15.120\n you know.\n\n12:15.120 --> 12:15.960\n The braces.\n\n12:15.960 --> 12:18.720\n The braces and all the rest of that, right.\n\n12:18.720 --> 12:25.720\n And I tend to go for a style that's very dense.\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:29.080\n Minimize the white space.\n\n12:30.080 --> 12:34.360\n Yeah, well, to maximize the amount\n\n12:34.360 --> 12:37.600\n that I can see at once, right?\n\n12:37.600 --> 12:40.760\n So I like to be able to see a whole function\n\n12:40.760 --> 12:43.080\n and to understand what it does,\n\n12:43.080 --> 12:44.960\n rather than have to go scroll, scroll, scroll\n\n12:44.960 --> 12:46.160\n and remember, right?\n\n12:46.160 --> 12:47.520\n Yeah, I'm with you on that.\n\n12:47.520 --> 12:48.360\n Yeah, that's.\n\n12:48.360 --> 12:50.040\n And people don't like that.\n\n12:52.640 --> 12:56.920\n Yeah, I've had, you know, multiple times\n\n12:56.920 --> 13:01.000\n when engineering teams have staged\n\n13:01.000 --> 13:03.660\n what was effectively an intervention.\n\n13:07.760 --> 13:10.120\n You know, where they invite me to a meeting\n\n13:10.120 --> 13:12.100\n and everybody's arrived before me\n\n13:12.100 --> 13:14.500\n and they all look at me and say,\n\n13:14.500 --> 13:19.500\n James, about your coding style, I'm sort of an odd person\n\n13:23.080 --> 13:28.080\n to be programming because I don't think very well verbally.\n\n13:31.560 --> 13:35.640\n I am just naturally a slow reader.\n\n13:37.760 --> 13:42.040\n I'm what most people would call a visual thinker.\n\n13:42.040 --> 13:43.560\n So when you think about a program,\n\n13:43.560 --> 13:45.080\n what do you see?\n\n13:45.080 --> 13:47.320\n I see pictures, right?\n\n13:47.320 --> 13:52.120\n So when I look at a piece of code on a piece of paper,\n\n13:52.120 --> 13:55.780\n it very quickly gets transformed into a picture.\n\n13:58.320 --> 14:01.880\n And, you know, it's almost like a piece of machinery\n\n14:01.880 --> 14:05.440\n with, you know, this connected to that and.\n\n14:05.440 --> 14:07.480\n Like these gears and different sizes.\n\n14:07.480 --> 14:11.320\n Yeah, yeah, I see them more like that\n\n14:11.320 --> 14:15.960\n than I see the sort of verbal structure\n\n14:15.960 --> 14:18.640\n or the lexical structure of letters.\n\n14:18.640 --> 14:19.960\n So then when you look at the program,\n\n14:19.960 --> 14:21.920\n that's why you want to see it all in the same place,\n\n14:21.920 --> 14:24.180\n then you can just map it to something visual.\n\n14:24.180 --> 14:25.600\n Yeah, and it just kind of like,\n\n14:25.600 --> 14:28.240\n like it leaps off the page at me and.\n\n14:28.240 --> 14:30.800\n Yeah, what are the inputs, what are the outputs?\n\n14:30.800 --> 14:32.160\n What the heck is this thing doing?\n\n14:32.160 --> 14:33.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n14:33.680 --> 14:35.720\n Getting a whole vision of it.\n\n14:35.720 --> 14:39.080\n Can we go back into your memory?\n\n14:39.080 --> 14:42.060\n Memory, long term memory access.\n\n14:42.060 --> 14:44.920\n What's the first program you've ever written?\n\n14:47.460 --> 14:52.100\n Oh, I have no idea what the first one was.\n\n14:52.100 --> 14:54.780\n I mean, I know the first machine\n\n14:54.780 --> 14:58.520\n that I learned to program on.\n\n14:58.520 --> 14:59.360\n What is it?\n\n14:59.360 --> 15:04.360\n Was a PDP eight at the University of Calgary.\n\n15:06.500 --> 15:08.100\n Do you remember the specs?\n\n15:08.100 --> 15:12.700\n Oh yeah, so the thing had 4K of RAM.\n\n15:12.700 --> 15:13.700\n Nice.\n\n15:13.700 --> 15:16.340\n 12 bit words.\n\n15:16.340 --> 15:18.520\n The clock rate was,\n\n15:21.500 --> 15:25.700\n it was about a third of a megahertz.\n\n15:26.580 --> 15:29.260\n Oh, so you didn't even get to the M, okay.\n\n15:29.260 --> 15:34.260\n Yeah, yeah, so we're like 10,000 times faster these days.\n\n15:34.260 --> 15:36.220\n 10,000 times faster these days.\n\n15:38.020 --> 15:40.500\n And was this kind of like a super computer,\n\n15:40.500 --> 15:42.340\n like a serious computer for.\n\n15:42.340 --> 15:46.180\n No, the PDP eight I was the first thing\n\n15:46.180 --> 15:49.700\n that people were calling like mini computer.\n\n15:49.700 --> 15:50.660\n Got it.\n\n15:50.660 --> 15:53.180\n They were sort of inexpensive enough\n\n15:53.180 --> 15:57.880\n that a university lab could maybe afford to buy one.\n\n15:59.340 --> 16:02.100\n And was there time sharing, all that kind of stuff?\n\n16:02.100 --> 16:06.220\n There actually was a time sharing OS for that,\n\n16:06.220 --> 16:10.500\n but it wasn't used really widely.\n\n16:10.500 --> 16:12.980\n The machine that I learned on was one\n\n16:12.980 --> 16:16.660\n that was kind of hidden in the back corner\n\n16:17.560 --> 16:19.960\n of the computer center.\n\n16:22.340 --> 16:27.340\n And it was bought as part of a project\n\n16:27.340 --> 16:32.340\n to do computer networking,\n\n16:34.180 --> 16:38.740\n but they didn't actually use it very much.\n\n16:38.740 --> 16:40.740\n It was mostly just kind of sitting there\n\n16:42.200 --> 16:44.180\n and it was kind of sitting there\n\n16:44.180 --> 16:47.020\n and I noticed it was just kind of sitting there.\n\n16:47.020 --> 16:50.580\n And so I started fooling around with it\n\n16:50.580 --> 16:52.900\n and nobody seemed to mind.\n\n16:52.900 --> 16:56.020\n So I just kept doing that and.\n\n16:56.020 --> 16:58.980\n And it had a keyboard and like a monitor, are we?\n\n16:58.980 --> 17:02.580\n Oh, this is way before monitors were common.\n\n17:02.580 --> 17:06.580\n So it was literally a model 33 teletype\n\n17:07.820 --> 17:09.320\n with a paper tape reader.\n\n17:12.060 --> 17:14.580\n Okay, so the user interface wasn't very good.\n\n17:14.580 --> 17:19.580\n Yeah, it was the first computer ever built\n\n17:20.140 --> 17:24.820\n with integrated circuits, but by integrated circuits,\n\n17:24.820 --> 17:29.620\n I mean that they would have like 10 or 12 transistors\n\n17:29.620 --> 17:31.940\n on one piece of silicon,\n\n17:31.940 --> 17:36.940\n not the 10 or 12 billion that the machines have today.\n\n17:38.740 --> 17:43.740\n So what did that, I mean, feel like if you remember those?\n\n17:43.740 --> 17:48.740\n I mean, did you have kind of inklings of the magic\n\n17:48.880 --> 17:52.840\n of exponential kind of improvement of Moore's law\n\n17:52.840 --> 17:55.220\n of the potential of the future that,\n\n17:55.220 --> 17:57.100\n was that your fingertips kind of thing?\n\n17:57.100 --> 17:58.480\n Or was it just a cool?\n\n17:58.480 --> 18:00.100\n Yeah, it was just a toy.\n\n18:01.140 --> 18:03.200\n I had always liked building stuff,\n\n18:04.080 --> 18:06.820\n but one of the problems with building stuff\n\n18:06.820 --> 18:08.740\n is that you need to have parts.\n\n18:08.740 --> 18:13.580\n You need to have pieces of wood or wire or switches\n\n18:13.580 --> 18:14.980\n or stuff like that.\n\n18:14.980 --> 18:16.820\n And those all cost money.\n\n18:16.820 --> 18:17.940\n And here you could build.\n\n18:17.940 --> 18:20.640\n You could build arbitrarily complicated things\n\n18:20.640 --> 18:23.760\n and I didn't need any physical materials.\n\n18:25.180 --> 18:27.220\n It required no money.\n\n18:27.220 --> 18:29.060\n That's a good way to put programming.\n\n18:29.060 --> 18:32.820\n You're right, it's, if you love building things,\n\n18:35.900 --> 18:38.780\n completely accessible, you don't need anything.\n\n18:38.780 --> 18:40.660\n Anybody from anywhere could just build\n\n18:40.660 --> 18:41.600\n something really cool.\n\n18:41.600 --> 18:43.060\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n18:43.060 --> 18:44.760\n If you've got access to a computer,\n\n18:44.760 --> 18:51.420\n you can build all kinds of crazy stuff.\n\n18:51.420 --> 18:58.220\n And when you were somebody like me\n\n18:58.220 --> 19:05.340\n who had like really no money, and I mean,\n\n19:05.340 --> 19:08.100\n I remember just lusting after being\n\n19:08.100 --> 19:15.780\n able to buy like a transistor.\n\n19:15.780 --> 19:20.260\n And when I would do sort of electronics kind of projects,\n\n19:20.260 --> 19:25.620\n they were mostly made, done by like dumpster diving for trash.\n\n19:27.420 --> 19:33.580\n And one of my big hauls was discarded relay racks\n\n19:33.580 --> 19:37.340\n from the back of the phone company switching center.\n\n19:37.340 --> 19:39.220\n Oh, nice.\n\n19:39.220 --> 19:41.340\n That was the big memorable treasure.\n\n19:41.340 --> 19:42.020\n Oh, yeah.\n\n19:42.020 --> 19:43.260\n Yeah, that was a really.\n\n19:43.260 --> 19:45.140\n What do you use that for?\n\n19:45.140 --> 19:47.420\n I built a machine that played tic tac toe.\n\n19:50.420 --> 19:51.180\n Nice.\n\n19:51.180 --> 19:52.060\n Out of relays.\n\n19:52.060 --> 19:55.780\n Of course, the thing that was really hard\n\n19:55.780 --> 20:00.140\n was that all the relays required a specific voltage.\n\n20:00.140 --> 20:04.540\n But getting a power supply that would do that voltage\n\n20:04.540 --> 20:06.260\n was pretty hard.\n\n20:06.260 --> 20:10.180\n And since I had a bunch of trashed television sets,\n\n20:10.180 --> 20:16.140\n I had to sort of cobble together something\n\n20:16.140 --> 20:21.380\n that was wrong but worked.\n\n20:21.380 --> 20:26.740\n So I was actually running these relays at 300 volts.\n\n20:26.740 --> 20:30.460\n And none of the electrical connections\n\n20:30.460 --> 20:33.460\n were like properly sealed off.\n\n20:33.460 --> 20:36.380\n Surprised you survived that period of your life.\n\n20:36.380 --> 20:38.940\n Oh, for so many reasons.\n\n20:38.940 --> 20:40.420\n For so many reasons.\n\n20:40.420 --> 20:45.380\n I mean, it's pretty common for teenage geeks\n\n20:45.380 --> 20:47.380\n to discover, oh, thermite.\n\n20:47.380 --> 20:50.460\n That's real easy to make.\n\n20:50.460 --> 20:51.220\n Yeah.\n\n20:51.220 --> 20:52.740\n Well, I'm glad you did.\n\n20:52.740 --> 20:58.820\n But do you remember what program in Calgary\n\n20:58.820 --> 21:01.820\n that you wrote, anything that stands out?\n\n21:01.820 --> 21:03.700\n And what language?\n\n21:03.700 --> 21:10.940\n Well, so mostly anything of any size was assembly code.\n\n21:14.780 --> 21:17.420\n And actually, before I learned assembly code,\n\n21:17.420 --> 21:19.100\n there was this programming language\n\n21:19.100 --> 21:22.660\n on the PDP 8 called Focal 5.\n\n21:22.660 --> 21:28.540\n And Focal 5 was kind of like a really stripped down Fortran.\n\n21:28.540 --> 21:33.580\n And I remember building programs that did things\n\n21:33.580 --> 21:40.940\n like play blackjack or solitaire.\n\n21:40.940 --> 21:45.180\n Or for some reason or other, the things that I really liked\n\n21:45.180 --> 21:50.300\n were ones where they were just like plotting graphs.\n\n21:50.300 --> 21:53.940\n So something with like a function or data,\n\n21:53.940 --> 21:55.420\n and then you plot it.\n\n21:55.420 --> 21:56.900\n Yeah.\n\n21:56.900 --> 21:59.300\n Yeah, I did a bunches of those things\n\n21:59.300 --> 22:03.100\n and went, ooh, pretty pictures.\n\n22:03.100 --> 22:07.340\n And so this would like print out, again, no monitors.\n\n22:07.340 --> 22:11.820\n Right, so it was like on a teletype.\n\n22:11.820 --> 22:13.260\n Yeah.\n\n22:13.260 --> 22:18.620\n So it's using something that's kind of like a typewriter.\n\n22:18.620 --> 22:23.140\n And then using those to plot functions.\n\n22:23.140 --> 22:26.100\n So when, I apologize to romanticize things,\n\n22:26.100 --> 22:32.300\n but when did you first fall in love with programming?\n\n22:32.300 --> 22:34.180\n What was the first programming language?\n\n22:34.180 --> 22:36.220\n Like as a serious, maybe, software engineer,\n\n22:36.220 --> 22:40.460\n where you thought this is a beautiful thing?\n\n22:40.460 --> 22:43.300\n I guess I never really thought of any particular language\n\n22:43.300 --> 22:46.620\n as being beautiful, because it was never really\n\n22:46.620 --> 22:47.820\n about the language for me.\n\n22:47.820 --> 22:49.540\n It was about what you could do with it.\n\n22:49.540 --> 22:55.660\n And even today, people try to get me\n\n22:55.660 --> 22:59.740\n into arguments about particular forms of syntax\n\n22:59.740 --> 23:00.460\n for this or that.\n\n23:00.460 --> 23:03.380\n And I'm like, who cares?\n\n23:03.380 --> 23:07.780\n It's about what you can do, not how you spell the word.\n\n23:10.340 --> 23:16.660\n And so back in those days, I learned like PL1 and Fortran\n\n23:16.660 --> 23:23.260\n and COBOL, and by the time that people were willing to hire me\n\n23:23.260 --> 23:29.500\n to do stuff, it was mostly assembly code and PDP assembly\n\n23:29.500 --> 23:35.820\n code and Fortran code and control data assembly\n\n23:35.820 --> 23:40.620\n code for the CDC 6400, which was an early, I guess,\n\n23:40.620 --> 23:43.100\n supercomputer.\n\n23:43.100 --> 23:46.340\n Even though that supercomputer has less compute power\n\n23:46.340 --> 23:50.540\n than my phone by a lot.\n\n23:50.540 --> 23:54.820\n And that was mostly, like you said, Fortran world.\n\n23:54.820 --> 23:57.380\n That said, you've also showed appreciation\n\n23:57.380 --> 24:01.580\n for the greatest language ever that I\n\n24:01.580 --> 24:05.020\n think everyone agrees is Lisp.\n\n24:05.020 --> 24:09.100\n Well, Lisp is definitely on my list of the greatest ones\n\n24:09.100 --> 24:11.700\n that have existed.\n\n24:11.700 --> 24:12.740\n Is it at number one?\n\n24:12.740 --> 24:16.140\n Or I mean, are you, I mean?\n\n24:16.140 --> 24:21.060\n You know, the thing is that it's, you know,\n\n24:21.060 --> 24:23.380\n I wouldn't put it number one, no.\n\n24:23.380 --> 24:24.620\n Is it the parentheses?\n\n24:24.620 --> 24:30.140\n What do you not love about Lisp?\n\n24:34.180 --> 24:35.780\n Well, I guess the number one thing\n\n24:35.780 --> 24:41.020\n to not love about it is so freaking many parentheses.\n\n24:41.020 --> 24:46.460\n On the love thing is, you know, out of those tons\n\n24:46.460 --> 24:50.180\n of parentheses, you actually get an interesting language\n\n24:50.180 --> 24:51.820\n structure.\n\n24:51.820 --> 24:54.300\n And I've always thought that there was a friendlier version\n\n24:54.300 --> 24:57.940\n of Lisp hiding out there somewhere.\n\n24:57.940 --> 25:03.140\n But I've never really spent much time thinking about it.\n\n25:03.140 --> 25:10.460\n But, you know, so like up the food chain for me from Lisp\n\n25:10.460 --> 25:14.420\n is Simula, which a very small number of people\n\n25:14.420 --> 25:16.140\n have ever used.\n\n25:16.140 --> 25:19.460\n But a lot of people, I think you had a huge influence, right,\n\n25:19.460 --> 25:20.620\n on the programming.\n\n25:20.620 --> 25:24.900\n But in the Simula, I apologize if I'm wrong on this,\n\n25:24.900 --> 25:27.780\n but is that one of the first functional languages?\n\n25:27.780 --> 25:28.300\n Or no?\n\n25:28.300 --> 25:32.780\n No, it was the first object oriented programming language.\n\n25:32.780 --> 25:36.540\n It's really where object oriented and languages sort\n\n25:36.540 --> 25:39.700\n of came together.\n\n25:39.700 --> 25:46.060\n And it was also the language where coroutines first showed\n\n25:46.060 --> 25:48.620\n up as a part of the language.\n\n25:48.620 --> 25:53.900\n So you could have a programming style that was,\n\n25:53.900 --> 25:57.740\n you could think of it as sort of multi threaded\n\n25:57.740 --> 26:00.900\n with a lot of parallelism.\n\n26:00.900 --> 26:01.620\n Really?\n\n26:01.620 --> 26:03.580\n There's ideas of parallelism in there?\n\n26:03.580 --> 26:05.340\n Yeah.\n\n26:05.340 --> 26:08.220\n Yeah, so that was back, you know,\n\n26:08.220 --> 26:12.780\n so the first Simula spec was Simula 67.\n\n26:12.780 --> 26:14.740\n Like 1967?\n\n26:14.740 --> 26:15.780\n Yeah.\n\n26:15.780 --> 26:16.420\n Wow.\n\n26:16.420 --> 26:21.980\n So it had coroutines, which are almost threads.\n\n26:21.980 --> 26:24.180\n The thing about coroutines is that they\n\n26:24.180 --> 26:26.220\n don't have true concurrency.\n\n26:26.220 --> 26:32.220\n So you can get away without really complex locking.\n\n26:32.220 --> 26:39.780\n You can't useably do coroutines on the multi core machine.\n\n26:39.780 --> 26:44.100\n Or if you try to do coroutines on the multi core machine,\n\n26:44.100 --> 26:48.460\n you don't actually get to use the multiple cores.\n\n26:48.460 --> 26:52.340\n Either that or you, because you start then\n\n26:52.340 --> 26:56.940\n having to get into the universe of semaphores and locks\n\n26:56.940 --> 27:00.060\n and things like that.\n\n27:00.060 --> 27:04.700\n But in terms of the style of programming,\n\n27:04.700 --> 27:11.460\n you could write code and think of it as being multi threaded.\n\n27:11.460 --> 27:15.860\n The mental model was very much a multi threaded one.\n\n27:15.860 --> 27:18.820\n And all kinds of problems you could\n\n27:18.820 --> 27:22.420\n approach very differently.\n\n27:22.420 --> 27:27.940\n To return to the world of Lisp for a brief moment,\n\n27:27.940 --> 27:32.940\n at CMU you wrote a version of Emacs\n\n27:32.940 --> 27:37.660\n that I think was very impactful on the history of Emacs.\n\n27:37.660 --> 27:42.220\n What was your motivation for doing so?\n\n27:42.220 --> 27:49.060\n At that time, so that was in like 85 or 86.\n\n27:52.820 --> 27:57.500\n I had been using Unix for a few years.\n\n27:57.500 --> 28:02.580\n And most of the editing was this tool\n\n28:02.580 --> 28:07.540\n called ED, which was sort of an ancestor of VI.\n\n28:10.940 --> 28:14.060\n Is it a pretty good editor, not a good editor?\n\n28:14.060 --> 28:19.220\n Well, if what you're using, if your input device\n\n28:19.220 --> 28:22.620\n is a teletype, it's pretty good.\n\n28:22.620 --> 28:25.740\n It's certainly more humane than TECO,\n\n28:25.740 --> 28:28.180\n which was kind of the common thing\n\n28:28.180 --> 28:32.580\n in a lot of the DEC universe at the time.\n\n28:32.580 --> 28:35.060\n TECO is spelled TK, is that the?\n\n28:35.060 --> 28:39.620\n No, TECO, T E C O, the text editor and corrector.\n\n28:39.620 --> 28:41.180\n Corrector, wow, so many features.\n\n28:44.100 --> 28:48.740\n And the original Emacs came out as,\n\n28:48.740 --> 28:52.060\n so Emacs stands for editor macros.\n\n28:52.060 --> 28:56.500\n And TECO had a way of writing macros.\n\n28:56.500 --> 29:02.780\n And so the original Emacs from MIT\n\n29:02.780 --> 29:07.060\n started out as a collection of macros for TECO.\n\n29:07.060 --> 29:15.060\n But then the Emacs style got popular originally at MIT.\n\n29:15.060 --> 29:20.300\n And then people did a few other implementations\n\n29:20.300 --> 29:26.180\n of Emacs that were, the code base was entirely different,\n\n29:26.180 --> 29:28.780\n but it was sort of the philosophical style\n\n29:28.780 --> 29:30.700\n of the original Emacs.\n\n29:30.700 --> 29:33.260\n What was the philosophy of Emacs?\n\n29:33.260 --> 29:36.580\n And by the way, were all the implementations always in C?\n\n29:36.580 --> 29:39.700\n And then how does Lisp fit into the picture?\n\n29:39.700 --> 29:43.300\n No, so the very first Emacs was written\n\n29:43.300 --> 29:46.420\n as a bunch of macros for the TECO text editor.\n\n29:46.420 --> 29:47.780\n Wow, that's so interesting.\n\n29:47.780 --> 29:54.220\n And the macro language for TECO was probably\n\n29:54.220 --> 29:59.100\n the most ridiculously obscure format.\n\n29:59.100 --> 30:02.420\n If you just look at a TECO program on a page,\n\n30:02.420 --> 30:05.900\n you think it was just random characters.\n\n30:05.900 --> 30:09.580\n It really looks like just line noise.\n\n30:09.580 --> 30:11.380\n So it's kind of like LaTeX or something.\n\n30:11.380 --> 30:14.860\n Oh, way worse than LaTeX.\n\n30:14.860 --> 30:18.100\n Way, way worse than LaTeX.\n\n30:18.100 --> 30:23.700\n But if you use TECO a lot, which I did,\n\n30:23.700 --> 30:31.180\n TECO was completely optimized for touch typing at high speed.\n\n30:31.180 --> 30:35.300\n So there were no two character commands.\n\n30:35.300 --> 30:37.980\n Well, there were a few, but mostly they\n\n30:37.980 --> 30:39.220\n were just one character.\n\n30:39.220 --> 30:43.780\n So every character on the keyboard was a separate command.\n\n30:43.780 --> 30:45.860\n And actually, every character on the keyboard\n\n30:45.860 --> 30:48.180\n was usually two or three commands\n\n30:48.180 --> 30:51.900\n because you could hit Shift and Control and all\n\n30:51.900 --> 30:52.700\n of those things.\n\n30:52.700 --> 30:56.420\n It's just a way of very tightly encoding it.\n\n30:56.420 --> 31:03.660\n And mostly what Emacs did was it made that visual.\n\n31:03.660 --> 31:10.140\n So one way to think of TECO is use Emacs with your eyes\n\n31:10.140 --> 31:15.500\n closed, where you have to maintain\n\n31:15.500 --> 31:20.660\n a mental model of a mental image of your document.\n\n31:20.660 --> 31:27.780\n You have to go, OK, so the cursor is between the A and the E.\n\n31:27.780 --> 31:31.860\n And I want to exchange those, so I do these things.\n\n31:31.860 --> 31:38.780\n So it is almost exactly the Emacs command set.\n\n31:38.780 --> 31:42.820\n Well, it's roughly the same as Emacs command set,\n\n31:42.820 --> 31:45.020\n but using Emacs with your eyes closed.\n\n31:47.780 --> 31:52.940\n So part of what Emacs added to the whole thing\n\n31:52.940 --> 31:56.700\n was being able to visually see what\n\n31:56.700 --> 32:02.180\n you were editing in a form that matched your document.\n\n32:02.180 --> 32:12.420\n And a lot of things changed in the command set because it\n\n32:12.420 --> 32:13.820\n was programmable.\n\n32:13.820 --> 32:15.980\n It was really flexible.\n\n32:15.980 --> 32:18.500\n You could add new commands for all kinds of things.\n\n32:18.500 --> 32:24.700\n And then people rewrote Emacs multiple times in Lisp.\n\n32:24.700 --> 32:28.180\n There was one done at MIT for the Lisp machine.\n\n32:28.180 --> 32:31.420\n There was one done for Multics.\n\n32:31.420 --> 32:35.100\n And one summer, I got a summer job\n\n32:35.100 --> 32:40.220\n to work on the Pascal compiler for Multics.\n\n32:40.220 --> 32:43.220\n And that was actually the first time I used Emacs.\n\n32:47.540 --> 32:48.900\n To write the compilers.\n\n32:48.900 --> 32:50.460\n You've worked on compilers, too.\n\n32:50.460 --> 32:52.180\n That's fascinating.\n\n32:52.180 --> 32:55.940\n Yeah, so I did a lot of work.\n\n32:55.940 --> 32:59.580\n I spent a really intense three months\n\n32:59.580 --> 33:05.300\n working on this Pascal compiler, basically living in Emacs.\n\n33:05.300 --> 33:11.260\n And it was the one written in Mac Lisp by Bernie Greenberg.\n\n33:11.260 --> 33:15.420\n And I thought, wow, this is just a way better way\n\n33:15.420 --> 33:16.260\n to do editing.\n\n33:19.060 --> 33:22.980\n And then I got back to CMU, where\n\n33:22.980 --> 33:28.700\n we had one of everything and two of a bunch of things\n\n33:28.700 --> 33:30.460\n and four of a few things.\n\n33:30.460 --> 33:36.140\n And since I mostly worked in the Unix universe,\n\n33:36.140 --> 33:39.340\n and Unix didn't have an Emacs, I decided\n\n33:39.340 --> 33:43.420\n that I needed to fix that problem.\n\n33:43.420 --> 33:47.620\n So I wrote this implementation of Emacs in C,\n\n33:47.620 --> 33:51.140\n because at the time, C was really the only language that\n\n33:51.140 --> 33:55.820\n worked on Unix.\n\n33:55.820 --> 33:58.660\n And you were comfortable with C as well at that point?\n\n33:58.660 --> 34:02.380\n Yeah, at that time, I had done a lot of C coding.\n\n34:02.380 --> 34:03.700\n This was in, like, 86.\n\n34:06.820 --> 34:14.100\n And it was running well enough for me\n\n34:14.100 --> 34:17.380\n to use it to edit itself within a month or two.\n\n34:17.380 --> 34:23.580\n And then it kind of took over the university.\n\n34:23.580 --> 34:25.380\n And it spread outside.\n\n34:25.380 --> 34:28.100\n Yeah, and then it went outside.\n\n34:28.100 --> 34:33.060\n And largely because Unix kind of took over the research\n\n34:33.060 --> 34:39.700\n community on the ARPANET, and Emacs\n\n34:39.700 --> 34:43.220\n was kind of the best editor out there.\n\n34:43.220 --> 34:44.300\n It kind of took over.\n\n34:44.300 --> 34:47.940\n And there was actually a brief period\n\n34:47.940 --> 34:55.300\n where I actually had login IDs on every nonmilitary host\n\n34:55.300 --> 34:59.140\n on the ARPANET.\n\n34:59.140 --> 35:01.420\n Because people would say, oh, can we install this?\n\n35:01.420 --> 35:09.700\n And I'd like, well, yeah, but you'll need some help.\n\n35:09.700 --> 35:11.860\n The days when security wasn't.\n\n35:11.860 --> 35:12.820\n When nobody cared.\n\n35:12.820 --> 35:15.500\n Nobody cared.\n\n35:15.500 --> 35:20.180\n I can ask briefly, what were those early days of ARPANET\n\n35:20.180 --> 35:25.780\n and the internet like?\n\n35:25.780 --> 35:28.820\n Did you, again, sorry for the silly question,\n\n35:28.820 --> 35:31.940\n but could you have possibly imagined\n\n35:31.940 --> 35:36.940\n that the internet would look like what it is today?\n\n35:36.940 --> 35:42.420\n Some of it is remarkably unchanged.\n\n35:42.420 --> 35:49.420\n So one of the things that I noticed really early on\n\n35:49.420 --> 35:51.980\n when I was at Carnegie Mellon was\n\n35:51.980 --> 36:00.740\n that a lot of social life became centered around the ARPANET.\n\n36:00.740 --> 36:06.380\n So things like between email and text messaging.\n\n36:06.380 --> 36:09.620\n Because text messaging was a part of the ARPANET\n\n36:09.620 --> 36:11.660\n really early on.\n\n36:11.660 --> 36:15.100\n There were no cell phones, but you're sitting at a terminal\n\n36:15.100 --> 36:16.820\n and you're typing stuff.\n\n36:16.820 --> 36:19.860\n So essentially email, or what is text messaging?\n\n36:19.860 --> 36:23.740\n Well, just like a one line message.\n\n36:23.740 --> 36:24.260\n Oh, cool.\n\n36:24.260 --> 36:25.540\n So like chat.\n\n36:25.540 --> 36:27.660\n Like chat.\n\n36:27.660 --> 36:31.820\n So it's like sending a one line message to somebody.\n\n36:31.820 --> 36:40.020\n And so pretty much everything from arranging lunch\n\n36:40.020 --> 36:48.100\n to going out on dates was all like driven by social media.\n\n36:48.100 --> 36:49.700\n Social media.\n\n36:49.700 --> 36:52.860\n Right, in the 80s.\n\n36:52.860 --> 36:55.420\n Easier than phone calls, yeah.\n\n36:55.420 --> 37:00.660\n And my life had gotten to where I\n\n37:00.660 --> 37:11.180\n was living on social media from the early mid 80s.\n\n37:11.180 --> 37:16.620\n And so when it sort of transformed into the internet\n\n37:16.620 --> 37:19.820\n and social media explodes, I was kind of like,\n\n37:19.820 --> 37:21.900\n what's the big deal?\n\n37:21.900 --> 37:24.140\n It's just a scale thing.\n\n37:24.140 --> 37:29.060\n Right, the scale thing is just astonishing.\n\n37:29.060 --> 37:32.380\n But the fundamentals in some ways remain the same.\n\n37:32.380 --> 37:36.020\n The fundamentals have hardly changed.\n\n37:36.020 --> 37:40.860\n And the technologies behind the networking\n\n37:40.860 --> 37:42.460\n have changed significantly.\n\n37:42.460 --> 37:49.460\n The watershed moment of going from the ARPANET\n\n37:49.460 --> 37:52.580\n to the internet.\n\n37:52.580 --> 37:57.300\n And then people starting to just scale and scale and scale.\n\n37:57.300 --> 38:03.660\n I mean, the scaling that happened in the early 90s\n\n38:03.660 --> 38:12.620\n and the way that so many vested interests fought the internet.\n\n38:12.620 --> 38:14.220\n Oh, interesting.\n\n38:14.220 --> 38:16.380\n What was the, oh, because you can't really\n\n38:16.380 --> 38:17.980\n control the internet.\n\n38:17.980 --> 38:19.900\n Yeah, so who fought the internet?\n\n38:19.900 --> 38:25.900\n So fundamentally, the cable TV companies\n\n38:25.900 --> 38:32.940\n and broadcasters and phone companies,\n\n38:32.940 --> 38:38.300\n at the deepest fibers of their being, they hated the internet.\n\n38:38.300 --> 38:50.580\n But it was often kind of a funny thing because, so think\n\n38:50.580 --> 38:53.900\n of a cable company.\n\n38:53.900 --> 38:57.220\n Most of the employees of a cable company,\n\n38:57.220 --> 39:04.460\n their job is getting TV shows, movies, whatever,\n\n39:04.460 --> 39:06.980\n out to their customers.\n\n39:06.980 --> 39:13.940\n They view their business as serving their customers.\n\n39:13.940 --> 39:20.780\n But as you climb up the hierarchy in the cable companies,\n\n39:20.780 --> 39:29.780\n that view shifts because really the business of the cable\n\n39:29.780 --> 39:34.460\n companies had always been selling eyeballs\n\n39:34.460 --> 39:36.580\n to advertisers.\n\n39:36.580 --> 39:37.060\n Right.\n\n39:39.820 --> 39:45.580\n And that view of a cable company\n\n39:45.580 --> 39:49.060\n didn't really dawn on most people who\n\n39:49.060 --> 39:50.900\n worked at the cable companies.\n\n39:50.900 --> 39:57.340\n But I had various dust ups with various cable companies\n\n39:57.340 --> 40:00.220\n where you could see in the stratified layers\n\n40:00.220 --> 40:06.260\n of the corporation that this view of the reason\n\n40:06.260 --> 40:13.140\n that you have cable TV is to capture eyeballs.\n\n40:13.140 --> 40:15.060\n So they didn't see it that way.\n\n40:15.060 --> 40:19.820\n Well, so most of the people who worked at the phone company\n\n40:19.820 --> 40:22.460\n or at the cable companies, their view\n\n40:22.460 --> 40:28.340\n was that their job was getting delightful content out\n\n40:28.340 --> 40:29.540\n to their customers.\n\n40:29.540 --> 40:33.140\n And their customers would pay for that.\n\n40:33.140 --> 40:40.100\n Higher up, they viewed this as a way of attracting eyeballs\n\n40:40.100 --> 40:41.940\n to them.\n\n40:41.940 --> 40:45.620\n And then what they were really doing\n\n40:45.620 --> 40:51.580\n was selling the eyeballs that were glued to their content\n\n40:51.580 --> 40:52.380\n to the advertisers.\n\n40:52.380 --> 40:54.420\n To the advertisers, yeah.\n\n40:54.420 --> 40:57.260\n And so the internet was a competition in that sense.\n\n40:57.260 --> 40:58.980\n Right.\n\n40:58.980 --> 41:00.300\n They were right.\n\n41:00.300 --> 41:02.620\n Well, yeah.\n\n41:02.620 --> 41:08.620\n I mean, there was one proposal that we sent,\n\n41:08.620 --> 41:14.460\n one detailed proposal that we wrote up back\n\n41:14.460 --> 41:19.700\n at Sun in the early 90s that was essentially like, look,\n\n41:19.700 --> 41:22.260\n anybody with internet technologies,\n\n41:22.260 --> 41:27.100\n anybody can become provider of content.\n\n41:27.100 --> 41:32.740\n So you could be distributing home movies\n\n41:32.740 --> 41:39.420\n to your parents or your cousins or who are anywhere else.\n\n41:39.420 --> 41:41.380\n So anybody can become a publisher.\n\n41:41.380 --> 41:43.300\n Wow, you were thinking about that already.\n\n41:43.300 --> 41:45.660\n Netflix, Netflix, YouTube.\n\n41:45.660 --> 41:49.780\n Yeah, that was like in the early 90s.\n\n41:49.780 --> 41:51.860\n And we thought, this would be great.\n\n41:54.060 --> 41:57.380\n And the kind of content we were thinking about at the time\n\n41:57.380 --> 42:05.100\n was like home movies, kids essays,\n\n42:05.100 --> 42:12.380\n stuff from grocery stores or a restaurant\n\n42:12.380 --> 42:16.740\n that they could actually start sending information about.\n\n42:20.340 --> 42:21.220\n That's brilliant.\n\n42:21.220 --> 42:25.060\n And the reaction of the cable companies\n\n42:25.060 --> 42:29.940\n was like, fuck no.\n\n42:29.940 --> 42:34.940\n Because then we're out of business.\n\n42:34.940 --> 42:38.420\n What is it about companies that, because they could have just,\n\n42:38.420 --> 42:40.060\n they could have been ahead of that wave.\n\n42:40.060 --> 42:41.780\n They could have listened to that.\n\n42:41.780 --> 42:42.660\n And they could have.\n\n42:42.660 --> 42:46.940\n They didn't see a path to revenue.\n\n42:46.940 --> 42:50.420\n Somewhere in there, there's a lesson for big companies,\n\n42:50.420 --> 42:56.060\n like to listen, to try to anticipate the renegade,\n\n42:56.060 --> 42:59.420\n the out there, out of the box, people like yourself\n\n42:59.420 --> 43:01.460\n in the early days writing proposals\n\n43:01.460 --> 43:03.780\n about what this could possibly be.\n\n43:03.780 --> 43:06.940\n Well, and that wasn't.\n\n43:06.940 --> 43:09.020\n If you're in a position where you're\n\n43:09.020 --> 43:19.780\n making truckloads of money off of a particular business model,\n\n43:19.780 --> 43:28.060\n the whole thought of leaping the chasm,\n\n43:28.060 --> 43:33.060\n you can see, oh, new models that are more effective\n\n43:33.060 --> 43:39.180\n are emerging, so like digital cameras versus film cameras.\n\n43:44.060 --> 43:45.820\n Why take the leap?\n\n43:45.820 --> 43:46.580\n Why take the leap?\n\n43:46.580 --> 43:50.980\n Because you're making so much money off of film.\n\n43:50.980 --> 43:59.500\n And in my past at Sun, one of our big customers was Kodak.\n\n43:59.500 --> 44:03.220\n And I ended up interacting with folks from Kodak quite a lot.\n\n44:03.220 --> 44:09.940\n And they actually had a big digital camera research\n\n44:09.940 --> 44:15.860\n and digital imaging business, or development group.\n\n44:15.860 --> 44:24.340\n And they knew that you just look at the trend lines\n\n44:24.340 --> 44:32.340\n and you look at the emerging quality of these digital\n\n44:32.340 --> 44:33.900\n cameras.\n\n44:33.900 --> 44:37.940\n And you can just plot it on the graph.\n\n44:37.940 --> 44:44.100\n And it's like, sure, film is better today.\n\n44:44.100 --> 44:51.340\n But digital is improving like this.\n\n44:51.340 --> 44:52.860\n The lines are going to cross.\n\n44:52.860 --> 44:56.820\n And the point at which the lines cross\n\n44:56.820 --> 45:00.260\n is going to be a collapse in their business.\n\n45:00.260 --> 45:05.100\n And they could see that.\n\n45:05.100 --> 45:07.740\n They absolutely knew that.\n\n45:07.740 --> 45:12.860\n The problem is that up to the point where they hit the wall,\n\n45:12.860 --> 45:16.300\n they were making truckloads of money.\n\n45:16.300 --> 45:24.300\n And when they did the math, it never\n\n45:24.300 --> 45:29.300\n started to make sense for them to kind of lead the charge.\n\n45:29.300 --> 45:32.460\n And part of the issues for a lot of companies\n\n45:32.460 --> 45:37.020\n for this kind of stuff is that if you're\n\n45:37.020 --> 45:39.260\n going to leap over a chasm like that,\n\n45:39.260 --> 45:45.820\n like with Kodak going from film to digital,\n\n45:45.820 --> 45:49.900\n that's a transition that's going to take a while.\n\n45:49.900 --> 45:53.500\n We had fights like this with people over smart cards.\n\n45:53.500 --> 45:57.820\n The smart cards fights were just ludicrous.\n\n45:57.820 --> 46:00.180\n But that's where visionary leadership comes in, right?\n\n46:00.180 --> 46:04.700\n Somebody needs to roll in and say, then take the leap.\n\n46:04.700 --> 46:07.300\n Well, it's partly take the leap,\n\n46:07.300 --> 46:09.500\n but it's also partly take the hit.\n\n46:09.500 --> 46:12.540\n Take the hit in the short term.\n\n46:12.540 --> 46:17.380\n So you can draw the graphs you want that show that if we leap\n\n46:17.380 --> 46:21.540\n from here, on our present trajectory, we're doing this\n\n46:21.540 --> 46:22.940\n and there's a cliff.\n\n46:22.940 --> 46:27.580\n If we force ourselves into a transition\n\n46:27.580 --> 46:33.660\n and we proactively do that, we can be on the next wave.\n\n46:33.660 --> 46:39.020\n But there will be a period when we're in a trough.\n\n46:39.020 --> 46:43.940\n And pretty much always there ends up being a trough\n\n46:43.940 --> 46:46.100\n as you leap the chasm.\n\n46:46.100 --> 46:52.620\n But the way that public companies work on this planet,\n\n46:52.620 --> 46:55.700\n they're reporting every quarter.\n\n46:55.700 --> 47:02.700\n And the one thing that a CEO must never do is take a big hit.\n\n47:02.700 --> 47:04.700\n Take a big hit.\n\n47:04.700 --> 47:06.180\n Over some quarter.\n\n47:06.180 --> 47:11.180\n And many of these transitions involve a big hit\n\n47:11.180 --> 47:17.340\n for a period of time, one, two, three quarters.\n\n47:17.340 --> 47:26.060\n And so you get some companies and like Tesla and Amazon\n\n47:26.060 --> 47:32.380\n are really good examples of companies that take huge hits.\n\n47:32.380 --> 47:34.140\n But they have the luxury of being\n\n47:34.140 --> 47:38.060\n able to ignore the stock market for a little while.\n\n47:38.060 --> 47:42.100\n And that's not so true today, really.\n\n47:42.100 --> 47:50.580\n But in the early days of both of those companies,\n\n47:50.580 --> 47:56.220\n they both did this thing of, I don't care\n\n47:56.220 --> 47:57.620\n about the quarterly reports.\n\n47:57.620 --> 48:02.260\n I care about how many happy customers we have.\n\n48:02.260 --> 48:05.900\n And having as many happy customers as possible\n\n48:05.900 --> 48:11.340\n can often be an enemy of the bottom line.\n\n48:11.340 --> 48:12.780\n Yeah, so how do they make that work?\n\n48:12.780 --> 48:15.460\n I mean, Amazon operated in the negative for a long time.\n\n48:15.460 --> 48:17.260\n It's like investing into the future.\n\n48:17.260 --> 48:18.060\n Right.\n\n48:18.060 --> 48:23.900\n But so Amazon and Google and Tesla and Facebook, a lot\n\n48:23.900 --> 48:30.340\n of those had what amounted to patient money,\n\n48:30.340 --> 48:36.540\n often because there's like a charismatic central figure who\n\n48:36.540 --> 48:41.020\n has a really large block of stock.\n\n48:41.020 --> 48:45.620\n And they can just make it so.\n\n48:45.620 --> 48:49.380\n So on that topic, just maybe it's a small tangent,\n\n48:49.380 --> 48:51.420\n but you've gotten the chance to work\n\n48:51.420 --> 48:53.220\n with some pretty big leaders.\n\n48:53.220 --> 48:56.460\n What are your thoughts about on the Tesla side, Elon Musk\n\n48:56.460 --> 49:00.060\n leadership, on the Amazon side, Jeff Bezos,\n\n49:00.060 --> 49:03.900\n all of these folks with large amounts of stock and vision\n\n49:03.900 --> 49:04.940\n in their company?\n\n49:04.940 --> 49:09.260\n I mean, they're founders, either complete founders\n\n49:09.260 --> 49:11.300\n or early on folks.\n\n49:11.300 --> 49:17.300\n And Amazon have taken a lot of leaps.\n\n49:17.300 --> 49:20.660\n And that probably at the time, people\n\n49:20.660 --> 49:26.340\n would criticize as like, what is this bookstore thing?\n\n49:26.340 --> 49:26.860\n Yeah.\n\n49:26.860 --> 49:31.220\n And Bezos had a vision.\n\n49:31.220 --> 49:36.460\n And he had the ability to just follow it.\n\n49:36.460 --> 49:37.820\n Lots of people have visions.\n\n49:37.820 --> 49:41.500\n And the average vision is completely idiotic,\n\n49:41.500 --> 49:45.020\n and you crash and burn.\n\n49:45.020 --> 49:49.900\n The Silicon Valley crash and burn rate is pretty high.\n\n49:52.500 --> 49:54.540\n And they don't necessarily crash and burn\n\n49:54.540 --> 49:55.900\n because they were dumb ideas.\n\n49:55.900 --> 50:00.780\n But often, it's just timing and luck.\n\n50:00.780 --> 50:07.860\n And you take companies like Tesla,\n\n50:07.860 --> 50:19.220\n and really, the original Tesla sort of pre Elon\n\n50:19.220 --> 50:22.140\n was kind of doing sort of OK.\n\n50:22.140 --> 50:26.300\n But he just drove them.\n\n50:26.300 --> 50:32.180\n And because he had a really strong vision,\n\n50:32.180 --> 50:40.220\n he would make calls that were always mostly pretty good.\n\n50:40.220 --> 50:44.580\n I mean, the Model X was kind of a goofball thing to do.\n\n50:44.580 --> 50:46.620\n But he did it boldly anyway.\n\n50:46.620 --> 50:50.100\n There's so many people that just said,\n\n50:50.100 --> 50:54.300\n there's so many people that oppose them on the door.\n\n50:54.300 --> 50:55.740\n From the engineering perspective,\n\n50:55.740 --> 50:58.820\n those doors are ridiculous.\n\n50:58.820 --> 51:02.060\n They are a complete travesty.\n\n51:02.060 --> 51:05.700\n But they're exactly the symbol of what great leadership is,\n\n51:05.700 --> 51:08.980\n which is like, you have a vision, and you just go.\n\n51:08.980 --> 51:12.220\n If you're going to do something stupid, make it really stupid.\n\n51:12.220 --> 51:14.380\n And go all in.\n\n51:14.380 --> 51:16.100\n Yeah.\n\n51:16.100 --> 51:22.500\n And to Musk's credit, he's a really sharp guy.\n\n51:22.500 --> 51:26.860\n So going back in time a little bit to Steve Jobs,\n\n51:26.860 --> 51:29.580\n Steve Jobs was a similar sort of character\n\n51:29.580 --> 51:34.260\n who had a strong vision and was really, really smart.\n\n51:34.260 --> 51:39.140\n And he wasn't smart about the technology parts of things.\n\n51:39.140 --> 51:47.900\n But he was really sharp about the sort of human relationship\n\n51:47.900 --> 51:51.300\n between the relationship between humans and objects.\n\n51:54.580 --> 51:57.780\n But he was a jerk.\n\n52:01.060 --> 52:02.660\n Can we just linger on that a little bit?\n\n52:02.660 --> 52:06.100\n People say he's a jerk.\n\n52:06.100 --> 52:08.060\n Is that a feature or a bug?\n\n52:08.060 --> 52:11.220\n Well, that's the question, right?\n\n52:11.220 --> 52:19.500\n So you take people like Steve, who was really hard on people.\n\n52:19.500 --> 52:25.380\n And so the question is, was he needlessly hard on people?\n\n52:25.380 --> 52:34.420\n Or was he just making people reach to meet his vision?\n\n52:34.420 --> 52:38.660\n And you could kind of spin it either way.\n\n52:41.540 --> 52:45.020\n Well, the results tell a story.\n\n52:45.020 --> 52:47.820\n He, through whatever jerk ways he had,\n\n52:47.820 --> 52:51.420\n he made people often do the best work of their life.\n\n52:51.420 --> 52:52.220\n Yeah.\n\n52:52.220 --> 52:54.420\n Yeah, and that was absolutely true.\n\n52:54.420 --> 52:59.980\n And I interviewed with him several times.\n\n52:59.980 --> 53:04.380\n I did various negotiations with him.\n\n53:04.380 --> 53:15.820\n And even though kind of personally I liked him,\n\n53:15.820 --> 53:18.540\n I could never work for him.\n\n53:18.540 --> 53:22.580\n Why do you think that?\n\n53:22.580 --> 53:25.500\n Can you put into words the kind of tension\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:29.580\n that you feel would be destructive as opposed\n\n53:29.580 --> 53:32.980\n to constructive?\n\n53:32.980 --> 53:35.780\n Oh, he'd yell at people.\n\n53:35.780 --> 53:39.020\n He'd call them names.\n\n53:39.020 --> 53:40.140\n And you don't like that?\n\n53:40.140 --> 53:41.780\n No.\n\n53:41.780 --> 53:43.980\n No, I don't think you need to do that.\n\n53:43.980 --> 53:46.660\n Yeah.\n\n53:46.660 --> 53:58.340\n And I think there's pushing people to excel.\n\n53:58.340 --> 54:01.580\n And then there's too far.\n\n54:01.580 --> 54:04.620\n And I think he was on the wrong side of the line.\n\n54:04.620 --> 54:07.460\n And I've never worked for Musk.\n\n54:07.460 --> 54:11.820\n I know a number of people who have, many of them have said,\n\n54:11.820 --> 54:13.820\n and it shows up in the press a lot,\n\n54:13.820 --> 54:18.260\n that Musk is kind of that way.\n\n54:18.260 --> 54:21.860\n And one of the things that I sort of loathe\n\n54:21.860 --> 54:24.700\n about Silicon Valley these days is\n\n54:24.700 --> 54:29.460\n that a lot of the high flying successes\n\n54:29.460 --> 54:33.380\n are run by people who are complete jerks.\n\n54:33.380 --> 54:39.700\n But it seems like there's come this sort of mythology out\n\n54:39.700 --> 54:44.420\n of Steve Jobs that the reason that he succeeded\n\n54:44.420 --> 54:50.180\n was because he was super hard on people.\n\n54:50.180 --> 54:57.260\n And in a number of corners, people start going,\n\n54:57.260 --> 55:02.060\n oh, if I want to succeed, I need to be a real jerk.\n\n55:02.060 --> 55:05.860\n And that, for me, just does not compute.\n\n55:05.860 --> 55:07.660\n I know a lot of successful people\n\n55:07.660 --> 55:11.780\n who are not jerks, who are perfectly fine people.\n\n55:11.780 --> 55:20.660\n And they tend to not be in the public eye.\n\n55:20.660 --> 55:24.900\n The general public somehow lifts the jerks up\n\n55:24.900 --> 55:28.580\n into the hero status.\n\n55:28.580 --> 55:29.340\n Right.\n\n55:29.340 --> 55:32.900\n Well, because they do things that get them in the press.\n\n55:32.900 --> 55:44.180\n And the people who don't do the kind of things\n\n55:44.180 --> 55:47.340\n that spill into the press.\n\n55:47.340 --> 55:54.660\n Yeah, I just talked to Chris Ladner for the second time.\n\n55:54.660 --> 55:56.700\n He's a super nice guy.\n\n55:56.700 --> 55:58.860\n Just an example of this kind of individual\n\n55:58.860 --> 56:00.300\n that's in the background.\n\n56:00.300 --> 56:03.060\n I feel like he's behind a million technologies.\n\n56:03.060 --> 56:06.860\n But he also talked about the jerkiness of some of the folks.\n\n56:06.860 --> 56:07.660\n Yeah.\n\n56:07.660 --> 56:10.660\n Yeah, and the fact that being a jerk\n\n56:10.660 --> 56:13.140\n has become a required style.\n\n56:13.140 --> 56:15.820\n But one thing I maybe want to ask on that\n\n56:15.820 --> 56:17.780\n is maybe to push back a little bit.\n\n56:17.780 --> 56:19.460\n So there's the jerk side.\n\n56:19.460 --> 56:22.420\n But there's also, if I were to criticize\n\n56:22.420 --> 56:25.220\n what I've seen in Silicon Valley, which is almost\n\n56:25.220 --> 56:28.380\n the resistance to working hard.\n\n56:28.380 --> 56:37.660\n So on the jerkiness side, it's so Posty Jobs and Elon kind\n\n56:37.660 --> 56:41.820\n of push people to work really hard to do.\n\n56:41.820 --> 56:43.820\n And there's a question whether it's\n\n56:43.820 --> 56:45.860\n possible to do that nicely.\n\n56:45.860 --> 56:47.540\n But one of the things that bothers me,\n\n56:47.540 --> 56:51.820\n maybe I'm just Russian and just kind of romanticize\n\n56:51.820 --> 56:53.300\n the whole suffering thing.\n\n56:53.300 --> 56:57.380\n But I think working hard is essential for accomplishing\n\n56:57.380 --> 57:00.140\n anything interesting, like really hard.\n\n57:00.140 --> 57:02.940\n And in the parlance of Silicon Valley,\n\n57:02.940 --> 57:04.820\n it's probably too hard.\n\n57:04.820 --> 57:10.340\n This idea of that you should work smart, not hard often\n\n57:10.340 --> 57:12.700\n to me sounds like you should be lazy.\n\n57:12.700 --> 57:15.220\n Because of course you want to be to work smart.\n\n57:15.220 --> 57:18.220\n Of course you would be maximally efficient.\n\n57:18.220 --> 57:20.140\n But in order to discover the efficient path\n\n57:20.140 --> 57:23.340\n like we're talking about with the short programs, you have to.\n\n57:23.340 --> 57:28.620\n Well, the smart, hard thing isn't an either or.\n\n57:28.620 --> 57:29.540\n It's an and.\n\n57:29.540 --> 57:30.620\n It's an and, yeah.\n\n57:30.620 --> 57:31.500\n Right.\n\n57:31.500 --> 57:42.460\n And the people who say you should work smart, not hard,\n\n57:42.460 --> 57:44.300\n they pretty much always fail.\n\n57:44.300 --> 57:45.020\n Yeah.\n\n57:45.020 --> 57:46.180\n Thank you.\n\n57:46.180 --> 57:46.660\n Right.\n\n57:46.660 --> 57:49.700\n I mean, that's just a recipe for disaster.\n\n57:49.700 --> 57:53.460\n I mean, there are counterexamples,\n\n57:53.460 --> 57:58.420\n but they're more people who benefited from luck.\n\n57:58.420 --> 57:59.940\n And you're saying, yeah, exactly.\n\n57:59.940 --> 58:04.620\n Luck and timing, like you said, is often an essential thing.\n\n58:04.620 --> 58:07.460\n But you're saying you can push people\n\n58:07.460 --> 58:13.580\n to work hard and do incredible work without being nasty.\n\n58:13.580 --> 58:14.900\n Yeah, without being nasty.\n\n58:14.900 --> 58:22.100\n I think Google is a good example of the leadership of Google\n\n58:22.100 --> 58:26.420\n throughout its history has been a pretty good example of not\n\n58:26.420 --> 58:28.140\n being nasty and being kind.\n\n58:28.140 --> 58:28.620\n Yeah.\n\n58:28.620 --> 58:35.820\n I mean, the twins, Larry and Sergey,\n\n58:35.820 --> 58:37.620\n are both pretty nice people.\n\n58:37.620 --> 58:39.660\n Sandra Pichai is very nice.\n\n58:39.660 --> 58:40.740\n Yeah.\n\n58:40.740 --> 58:41.260\n Yeah.\n\n58:41.260 --> 58:49.860\n And it's a culture of people who work really, really hard.\n\n58:49.860 --> 58:54.220\n Let me ask maybe a little bit of a tense question.\n\n58:54.220 --> 58:56.500\n We're talking about Emacs.\n\n58:56.500 --> 58:58.900\n It seems like you've done some incredible work,\n\n58:58.900 --> 59:02.020\n so outside of Java, you've done some incredible work that\n\n59:02.020 --> 59:06.460\n didn't become as popular as it could have because of licensing\n\n59:06.460 --> 59:11.700\n issues and open source issues.\n\n59:11.700 --> 59:18.740\n Is it, what are your thoughts about that entire mess?\n\n59:18.740 --> 59:24.340\n Like what's about open source now in retrospect looking back?\n\n59:24.340 --> 59:27.060\n About licensing, about open sourcing,\n\n59:27.060 --> 59:33.820\n do you think open source is a good thing, a bad thing?\n\n59:33.820 --> 59:35.660\n Do you have regrets?\n\n59:35.660 --> 59:38.020\n Do you have wisdom that you've learned\n\n59:38.020 --> 59:39.900\n from that whole experience?\n\n59:39.900 --> 59:45.380\n So in general, I'm a big fan of open source.\n\n59:45.380 --> 59:49.780\n The way that it can be used to build communities and promote\n\n59:49.780 --> 59:54.260\n the development of things and promote collaboration and all\n\n59:54.260 --> 59:56.140\n of that is really pretty grand.\n\n59:59.100 --> 1:00:04.460\n When open source turns into a religion that says all things\n\n1:00:04.460 --> 1:00:10.860\n must be open source, I get kind of weird about that\n\n1:00:10.860 --> 1:00:17.420\n because it's sort of like saying some versions of that\n\n1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:22.300\n end up saying that all software engineers\n\n1:00:22.300 --> 1:00:28.100\n must take a vow of poverty, right, as though.\n\n1:00:28.100 --> 1:00:30.060\n It's unethical to have money.\n\n1:00:30.060 --> 1:00:31.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:31.540 --> 1:00:34.500\n To build a company, right.\n\n1:00:34.500 --> 1:00:41.260\n And there's a slice of me that actually kind of buys into that\n\n1:00:41.260 --> 1:00:50.060\n because people who make billions of dollars off of a patent,\n\n1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:56.260\n and the patent came from literally a stroke\n\n1:00:56.260 --> 1:01:02.500\n of lightning that hits you as you lie half awake in bed.\n\n1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:03.980\n Yeah, that's lucky.\n\n1:01:03.980 --> 1:01:06.060\n Good for you.\n\n1:01:06.060 --> 1:01:09.700\n The way that that sometimes sort of explodes\n\n1:01:09.700 --> 1:01:14.420\n into something that looks to me a lot like exploitation,\n\n1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:18.540\n you see a lot of that in the drug industry.\n\n1:01:18.540 --> 1:01:26.620\n You know, when you've got medications that cost you\n\n1:01:26.620 --> 1:01:33.900\n like $100 a day, and it's like, no.\n\n1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:39.060\n Yeah, so the interesting thing about the sort of open source,\n\n1:01:39.060 --> 1:01:44.220\n what bothers me is when something is not open source,\n\n1:01:44.220 --> 1:01:48.700\n and because of that, it's a worse product.\n\n1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:49.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:52.700\n So like, I mean, if I look at your just implementation\n\n1:01:52.700 --> 1:01:56.620\n of Emacs, like that could have been the dominant implementation.\n\n1:01:56.620 --> 1:01:57.460\n Like I use Emacs.\n\n1:01:57.460 --> 1:01:58.700\n That's my main ID.\n\n1:01:58.700 --> 1:02:02.540\n I apologize to the world, but I still love it.\n\n1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:09.020\n And I could have been using your implementation of Emacs.\n\n1:02:09.020 --> 1:02:11.180\n And why aren't I?\n\n1:02:11.180 --> 1:02:14.180\n So are you using the GNU Emacs?\n\n1:02:14.180 --> 1:02:16.380\n I guess the default on Linux is that GNU?\n\n1:02:16.380 --> 1:02:16.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:20.420\n And that, through a strange passage,\n\n1:02:20.420 --> 1:02:22.220\n started out as the one that I wrote.\n\n1:02:22.220 --> 1:02:22.740\n Exactly.\n\n1:02:22.740 --> 1:02:26.540\n So it still has a, yeah.\n\n1:02:26.540 --> 1:02:32.860\n Well, and part of that was because in the last couple\n\n1:02:32.860 --> 1:02:38.980\n of years of grad school, it became really clear\n\n1:02:38.980 --> 1:02:46.060\n to me that I was either going to be Mr. Emacs forever\n\n1:02:46.060 --> 1:02:50.060\n or I was going to graduate.\n\n1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:50.580\n Got it.\n\n1:02:50.580 --> 1:02:54.340\n I couldn't actually do both.\n\n1:02:54.340 --> 1:02:56.260\n Was that a hard decision?\n\n1:02:56.260 --> 1:02:58.700\n That's so interesting to think about you as a,\n\n1:02:58.700 --> 1:03:01.260\n like it's a different trajectory that could have happened.\n\n1:03:01.260 --> 1:03:01.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:04.420\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:03:04.420 --> 1:03:10.220\n And maybe I could be fabulously wealthy today\n\n1:03:10.220 --> 1:03:13.580\n if I had become Mr. Emacs, and Emacs\n\n1:03:13.580 --> 1:03:19.220\n had mushroomed into a series of text processing applications\n\n1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:20.340\n and all kinds of stuff.\n\n1:03:20.340 --> 1:03:24.340\n And I would have, you know.\n\n1:03:24.340 --> 1:03:30.620\n But I have a long history of financially suboptimal\n\n1:03:30.620 --> 1:03:38.300\n decisions because I didn't want that life, right?\n\n1:03:38.300 --> 1:03:47.300\n And I went to grad school because I wanted to graduate.\n\n1:03:47.300 --> 1:03:58.260\n And being Mr. Emacs for a while was kind of fun,\n\n1:03:58.260 --> 1:04:03.420\n and then it kind of became not fun.\n\n1:04:03.420 --> 1:04:10.540\n And when it was not fun, there was\n\n1:04:10.540 --> 1:04:17.060\n no way I could pay my rent, right?\n\n1:04:17.060 --> 1:04:23.780\n And I was like, OK, do I carry on as a grad student?\n\n1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:25.620\n I had a research assistantship, and I\n\n1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:27.220\n was sort of living off of that.\n\n1:04:27.220 --> 1:04:30.180\n And I was trying to do my, you know,\n\n1:04:30.180 --> 1:04:33.380\n I was doing all my RA work, all my RA,\n\n1:04:33.380 --> 1:04:35.220\n you know, being grad student work\n\n1:04:35.220 --> 1:04:37.820\n and being Mr. Emacs all at the same time.\n\n1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:45.260\n And I decided to pick one.\n\n1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:48.340\n And one of the things that I did at the time\n\n1:04:48.340 --> 1:04:53.660\n was I went around all the people I knew on the ARPANET who\n\n1:04:53.660 --> 1:04:58.980\n might be able to take over looking after Emacs.\n\n1:04:58.980 --> 1:05:06.300\n And pretty much everybody said, eh, I got a day job.\n\n1:05:06.300 --> 1:05:12.340\n So I actually found two folks and a couple\n\n1:05:12.340 --> 1:05:20.540\n of folks in a garage in New Jersey, complete with a dog,\n\n1:05:20.540 --> 1:05:22.940\n who were willing to take it over.\n\n1:05:22.940 --> 1:05:26.140\n But they were going to have to charge money.\n\n1:05:26.140 --> 1:05:31.180\n But my deal with them was that they would only,\n\n1:05:31.180 --> 1:05:33.700\n that they would make it free for universities and schools\n\n1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:34.980\n and stuff.\n\n1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:36.620\n And they said sure.\n\n1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:41.100\n And you know, that upset some people.\n\n1:05:41.100 --> 1:05:43.860\n So you have some, now I don't know the full history of this,\n\n1:05:43.860 --> 1:05:46.780\n but I think it's kind of interesting.\n\n1:05:46.780 --> 1:05:54.340\n You have some tension with Mr. Richard Stallman over the,\n\n1:05:54.340 --> 1:05:56.660\n and he kind of represents this kind of,\n\n1:05:56.660 --> 1:06:03.660\n like you mentioned, free software,\n\n1:06:03.660 --> 1:06:07.260\n sort of a dogmatic focus on, yeah.\n\n1:06:07.260 --> 1:06:10.140\n All information must be free.\n\n1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:10.860\n Must be free.\n\n1:06:10.860 --> 1:06:14.220\n So what, is there an interesting way\n\n1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:17.420\n to paint a picture of the disagreement\n\n1:06:17.420 --> 1:06:19.900\n you have with Richard through the years?\n\n1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:26.980\n My basic opposition is that when you say information\n\n1:06:26.980 --> 1:06:32.100\n must be free, to a really extreme form that\n\n1:06:32.100 --> 1:06:38.780\n turns into all people whose job is\n\n1:06:38.780 --> 1:06:49.300\n the production of everything from movies to software.\n\n1:06:49.300 --> 1:06:52.580\n They must all take a vow of poverty\n\n1:06:52.580 --> 1:06:56.740\n because information must be free.\n\n1:06:56.740 --> 1:06:59.980\n And that doesn't work for me.\n\n1:06:59.980 --> 1:07:05.060\n And I don't want to be wildly rich.\n\n1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:08.780\n I am not wildly rich.\n\n1:07:08.780 --> 1:07:10.100\n I do OK.\n\n1:07:14.260 --> 1:07:20.620\n But I do actually, I can feed my children.\n\n1:07:20.620 --> 1:07:22.220\n Yeah, I totally agree with you.\n\n1:07:22.220 --> 1:07:25.340\n It does just make me sad that sometimes\n\n1:07:25.340 --> 1:07:28.540\n the closing of the source, for some reason\n\n1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:33.620\n that people that, like a bureaucracy begins to build,\n\n1:07:33.620 --> 1:07:37.460\n and sometimes it doesn't, it hurts the product.\n\n1:07:37.460 --> 1:07:38.660\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n1:07:38.660 --> 1:07:39.380\n Absolutely.\n\n1:07:39.380 --> 1:07:40.420\n It's always sad.\n\n1:07:40.420 --> 1:07:44.740\n And there is a balance in there.\n\n1:07:44.740 --> 1:07:47.060\n There's a balance.\n\n1:07:47.060 --> 1:07:56.100\n And it's not hard over rapacious capitalism.\n\n1:07:56.100 --> 1:08:02.660\n And it's not hard over in the other direction.\n\n1:08:02.660 --> 1:08:07.820\n And a lot of the open source movement,\n\n1:08:07.820 --> 1:08:11.780\n they have been managing to find the path\n\n1:08:11.780 --> 1:08:15.220\n to actually making money.\n\n1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:18.900\n So doing things like service and support\n\n1:08:18.900 --> 1:08:20.860\n works for a lot of people.\n\n1:08:20.860 --> 1:08:33.100\n And there are some ways where it's kind of, some of them\n\n1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:35.820\n are a little perverse.\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:43.180\n So as a part of things like this Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act\n\n1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:45.860\n and various people's interpretations\n\n1:08:45.860 --> 1:08:49.860\n of all kinds of accounting principles.\n\n1:08:49.860 --> 1:08:51.860\n And this is kind of a worldwide thing.\n\n1:08:51.860 --> 1:08:55.300\n But if you've got a corporation that\n\n1:08:55.300 --> 1:09:01.220\n is depending on some piece of software,\n\n1:09:01.220 --> 1:09:04.540\n often various accounting and reporting standards\n\n1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:08.420\n say if you don't have a support contract on this thing\n\n1:09:08.420 --> 1:09:15.940\n that your business is depending on, then that's bad.\n\n1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:21.420\n So if you've got a database, you need to pay for support.\n\n1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:30.100\n But there's a difference between the sort of support contracts\n\n1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:37.060\n that the average open source database producer charges\n\n1:09:37.060 --> 1:09:44.500\n and what somebody who is truly rapacious like Oracle charges.\n\n1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:47.260\n Yeah, so it's a balance, like you said.\n\n1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:49.660\n It is absolutely a balance.\n\n1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:57.060\n And there are a lot of different ways\n\n1:09:57.060 --> 1:10:04.900\n to make the math work out for everybody.\n\n1:10:04.900 --> 1:10:16.700\n And the very unbalanced sort of like the winner\n\n1:10:16.700 --> 1:10:23.140\n takes all thing that happens in so much of modern commerce,\n\n1:10:23.140 --> 1:10:26.180\n that just doesn't work for me either.\n\n1:10:26.180 --> 1:10:31.380\n I know you've talked about this in quite a few places,\n\n1:10:31.380 --> 1:10:37.020\n but you have created one of the most popular programming\n\n1:10:37.020 --> 1:10:39.180\n languages in the world.\n\n1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:41.740\n This is a programming language that I first\n\n1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:46.740\n learned about object oriented programming with.\n\n1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:49.260\n I think it's a programming language\n\n1:10:49.260 --> 1:10:52.620\n that a lot of people use in a lot of different places\n\n1:10:52.620 --> 1:10:55.740\n and millions of devices today, Java.\n\n1:10:55.740 --> 1:11:00.420\n So the absurd question, but can you\n\n1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:03.060\n tell the origin story of Java?\n\n1:11:03.060 --> 1:11:07.340\n So a long time ago at Sun in about 1990,\n\n1:11:07.340 --> 1:11:12.740\n there was a group of us who were kind of worried\n\n1:11:12.740 --> 1:11:18.620\n that there was stuff going on in the universe of computing\n\n1:11:18.620 --> 1:11:21.020\n that the computing industry was missing out on.\n\n1:11:21.020 --> 1:11:29.740\n And so a few of us started this project\n\n1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:32.380\n at Sun that really got going.\n\n1:11:32.380 --> 1:11:34.860\n I mean, we started talking about it in 1990,\n\n1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:39.020\n and it really got going in 91.\n\n1:11:39.020 --> 1:11:44.860\n And it was all about what was happening\n\n1:11:44.860 --> 1:11:48.820\n in terms of computing hardware processors\n\n1:11:48.820 --> 1:11:53.220\n and networking and all of that that was outside\n\n1:11:53.220 --> 1:11:54.340\n of the computer industry.\n\n1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:59.060\n And that was everything from the sort\n\n1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:03.500\n of early glimmers of cell phones that were happening then\n\n1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:07.940\n to you look at elevators and locomotives\n\n1:12:07.940 --> 1:12:12.500\n and process control systems in factories\n\n1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:20.820\n and all kinds of audio equipment and video equipment.\n\n1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:22.740\n They all had processors in them, and they were all\n\n1:12:22.740 --> 1:12:24.820\n doing stuff with them.\n\n1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:30.860\n And it sort of felt like there was something going on there\n\n1:12:30.860 --> 1:12:34.420\n that we needed to understand.\n\n1:12:34.420 --> 1:12:36.020\n And\n\n1:12:36.020 --> 1:12:38.980\n So C and C++ was in the air already.\n\n1:12:38.980 --> 1:12:42.300\n Oh, no, C and C++ absolutely owned the universe\n\n1:12:42.300 --> 1:12:42.940\n at that time.\n\n1:12:42.940 --> 1:12:45.140\n Everything was written in C and C++.\n\n1:12:45.140 --> 1:12:46.860\n So where was the hunch that there\n\n1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:48.780\n was a need for a revolution?\n\n1:12:48.780 --> 1:12:50.700\n Well, so the need for a revolution\n\n1:12:50.700 --> 1:12:54.500\n was not about a language.\n\n1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:59.900\n It was just as simple and vague as there\n\n1:12:59.900 --> 1:13:03.620\n are things happening out there.\n\n1:13:03.620 --> 1:13:04.980\n We need to understand them.\n\n1:13:04.980 --> 1:13:08.580\n We need to understand them.\n\n1:13:08.580 --> 1:13:16.900\n And so a few of us went on several somewhat epic road\n\n1:13:16.900 --> 1:13:19.420\n trips.\n\n1:13:19.420 --> 1:13:20.660\n Literal road trips?\n\n1:13:20.660 --> 1:13:21.860\n Literal road trips.\n\n1:13:21.860 --> 1:13:24.740\n It's like get on an airplane, go to Japan,\n\n1:13:24.740 --> 1:13:31.820\n visit Toshiba and Sharp and Mitsubishi and Sony\n\n1:13:31.820 --> 1:13:33.700\n and all of these folks.\n\n1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:36.620\n And because we worked for Sun, we\n\n1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:42.300\n had folks who were willing to give us introductions.\n\n1:13:42.300 --> 1:13:50.060\n We visited Samsung and a bunch of Korean companies.\n\n1:13:50.060 --> 1:13:51.340\n And we went all over Europe.\n\n1:13:51.340 --> 1:13:56.620\n We went to places like Philips and Siemens and Thomson.\n\n1:13:56.620 --> 1:14:00.020\n And what did you see there?\n\n1:14:00.020 --> 1:14:02.980\n For me, one of the things that sort of leapt out\n\n1:14:02.980 --> 1:14:07.300\n was that they were doing all the usual computer things\n\n1:14:07.300 --> 1:14:10.540\n that people had been doing like 20 years before.\n\n1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:13.100\n The thing that really leapt out to me\n\n1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:16.700\n was that they were sort of reinventing\n\n1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:18.820\n computer networking.\n\n1:14:18.820 --> 1:14:24.340\n And they were making all the mistakes\n\n1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:28.580\n that people in the computer industry had made.\n\n1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:32.180\n And since I had been doing a lot of work in the networking\n\n1:14:32.180 --> 1:14:37.140\n area, we'd go and visit Company X.\n\n1:14:37.140 --> 1:14:40.540\n They'd describe this networking thing that they were doing.\n\n1:14:40.540 --> 1:14:43.260\n And just without any thought, I could tell them\n\n1:14:43.260 --> 1:14:45.980\n like the 25 things that were going\n\n1:14:45.980 --> 1:14:49.020\n to be complete disasters with that thing\n\n1:14:49.020 --> 1:14:52.220\n that they were doing.\n\n1:14:52.220 --> 1:14:55.700\n And I don't know whether that had any impact on any of them.\n\n1:14:55.700 --> 1:15:03.180\n But that particular story of repeating the disasters\n\n1:15:03.180 --> 1:15:07.940\n of the computer science industry was there.\n\n1:15:07.940 --> 1:15:11.300\n And one of the things we thought was, well,\n\n1:15:11.300 --> 1:15:15.420\n maybe we could do something useful here with bringing them\n\n1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:16.380\n forward somewhat.\n\n1:15:16.380 --> 1:15:24.180\n But also, at the same time, we learned a bunch of things\n\n1:15:24.180 --> 1:15:29.180\n from these mostly consumer electronics companies.\n\n1:15:31.940 --> 1:15:39.780\n And high on the list was that they\n\n1:15:39.780 --> 1:15:42.980\n viewed their relationship with the customer as sacred.\n\n1:15:45.460 --> 1:15:51.820\n They were never, ever willing to make tradeoffs\n\n1:15:51.820 --> 1:15:56.540\n between for safety.\n\n1:15:56.540 --> 1:16:00.300\n So one of the things that had always\n\n1:16:00.300 --> 1:16:04.900\n made me nervous in the computer industry\n\n1:16:04.900 --> 1:16:12.220\n was that people were willing to make tradeoffs in reliability\n\n1:16:12.220 --> 1:16:13.500\n to get performance.\n\n1:16:17.540 --> 1:16:18.740\n They want faster, faster.\n\n1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:21.460\n It breaks a little more often because it's fast.\n\n1:16:21.460 --> 1:16:23.940\n Maybe you run it a little hotter than you should.\n\n1:16:23.940 --> 1:16:27.620\n Or the one that always blew my mind\n\n1:16:27.620 --> 1:16:34.100\n was the way that the folks at Cray Supercomputers\n\n1:16:34.100 --> 1:16:38.780\n got their division to be really fast\n\n1:16:38.780 --> 1:16:44.220\n was that they did Newton Raphson approximations.\n\n1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:51.420\n And so the bottom several bits of A over B\n\n1:16:51.420 --> 1:16:55.540\n were essentially random numbers.\n\n1:16:55.540 --> 1:16:56.860\n What could possibly go wrong?\n\n1:16:56.860 --> 1:16:59.700\n What could go wrong?\n\n1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:08.580\n And just figuring out how to nail the bottom bit,\n\n1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:14.700\n how to make sure that if you put a piece of toast in a toaster,\n\n1:17:14.700 --> 1:17:18.300\n it's not going to kill the customer.\n\n1:17:18.300 --> 1:17:22.540\n It's not going to burst into flames and burn the house down.\n\n1:17:22.540 --> 1:17:26.860\n So I guess those are the principles that were inspiring.\n\n1:17:26.860 --> 1:17:33.100\n But how did, from the days of Java's called oak,\n\n1:17:33.100 --> 1:17:34.980\n because of a tree outside the window story\n\n1:17:34.980 --> 1:17:37.100\n that a lot of people know, how did it\n\n1:17:37.100 --> 1:17:43.900\n become this incredible, powerful language?\n\n1:17:43.900 --> 1:17:46.780\n Well, so it was a bunch of things.\n\n1:17:46.780 --> 1:17:50.660\n So after all that, the way that we\n\n1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:54.500\n decided that we could understand things better\n\n1:17:54.500 --> 1:17:59.300\n was by building a demo, building a prototype of something.\n\n1:17:59.300 --> 1:18:02.740\n So because it was easy and fun, we\n\n1:18:02.740 --> 1:18:07.220\n decided to build a control system for some home\n\n1:18:07.220 --> 1:18:11.020\n electronics, TV, VCR, that kind of stuff.\n\n1:18:11.020 --> 1:18:16.580\n And as we were building it, we discovered\n\n1:18:16.580 --> 1:18:19.660\n that there were some things about standard practice\n\n1:18:19.660 --> 1:18:26.380\n in C programming that were really getting in the way.\n\n1:18:26.380 --> 1:18:32.380\n And it wasn't exactly because we were writing all this C code\n\n1:18:32.380 --> 1:18:37.740\n and C++ code that we couldn't write it to do the right thing.\n\n1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:42.340\n But one of the things that was weird in the group\n\n1:18:42.340 --> 1:18:50.860\n was that we had a guy whose top level job was\n\n1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:52.940\n he was a business guy.\n\n1:18:52.940 --> 1:18:57.780\n He was an MBA kind of person, think about business plans\n\n1:18:57.780 --> 1:18:58.660\n and all of that.\n\n1:18:58.660 --> 1:19:05.260\n And there were a bunch of things that were kind of,\n\n1:19:05.260 --> 1:19:07.540\n and we would talk about things that were going wrong\n\n1:19:07.540 --> 1:19:10.100\n and things that were going wrong,\n\n1:19:10.100 --> 1:19:11.260\n things that were going right.\n\n1:19:11.260 --> 1:19:16.140\n And as we thought about things like the requirements\n\n1:19:16.140 --> 1:19:21.540\n for security and safety, some low level details\n\n1:19:21.540 --> 1:19:24.060\n and see like naked pointers.\n\n1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:24.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:24.980 --> 1:19:35.300\n And so back in the early 90s, it was well understood\n\n1:19:35.300 --> 1:19:41.580\n that the number one source of security vulnerabilities.\n\n1:19:41.580 --> 1:19:42.380\n Was pointers.\n\n1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:45.980\n Was just pointers, was just bugs.\n\n1:19:45.980 --> 1:19:52.420\n And it was like 50%, 60%, 70% of all security vulnerabilities\n\n1:19:52.420 --> 1:19:53.300\n were bugs.\n\n1:19:53.300 --> 1:19:57.980\n And the vast majority of them were like buffer overflows.\n\n1:19:57.980 --> 1:20:00.140\n So you're like, we have to fix this.\n\n1:20:00.140 --> 1:20:04.020\n We have to make sure that this cannot happen.\n\n1:20:04.020 --> 1:20:07.420\n And that was kind of the original thing for me\n\n1:20:07.420 --> 1:20:11.420\n was this cannot continue.\n\n1:20:11.420 --> 1:20:16.500\n And one of the things I find really entertaining this year\n\n1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:22.340\n was, I forget which Rag published it,\n\n1:20:22.340 --> 1:20:24.780\n but there was this article that came out\n\n1:20:24.780 --> 1:20:31.220\n that was sort of the result of an examination\n\n1:20:31.220 --> 1:20:35.260\n of all the security vulnerabilities in Chrome.\n\n1:20:35.260 --> 1:20:39.100\n And Chrome is like a giant piece of C++ code.\n\n1:20:39.100 --> 1:20:44.100\n And 60% or 70% of all the security vulnerabilities\n\n1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:48.100\n were stupid pointer tricks.\n\n1:20:48.100 --> 1:20:54.260\n And I thought, it's 30 years later and we're still there.\n\n1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:54.940\n Still there.\n\n1:20:54.940 --> 1:20:56.260\n And we're still there.\n\n1:20:56.260 --> 1:21:00.900\n And that's one of those slap your forehead\n\n1:21:00.900 --> 1:21:05.220\n and just want to cry moments.\n\n1:21:05.220 --> 1:21:09.060\n Would you attribute, or is that too much of a simplification,\n\n1:21:09.060 --> 1:21:11.300\n but would you attribute the creation of Java\n\n1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:15.460\n to C pointers?\n\n1:21:15.460 --> 1:21:16.660\n Obvious problem.\n\n1:21:16.660 --> 1:21:21.820\n Well, I mean, that was one of the trigger points.\n\n1:21:21.820 --> 1:21:23.420\n Concurrency you've mentioned.\n\n1:21:23.420 --> 1:21:24.980\n Concurrency was a big deal.\n\n1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:31.100\n Because when you're interacting with people,\n\n1:21:31.100 --> 1:21:32.740\n the last thing you ever want to see\n\n1:21:32.740 --> 1:21:37.860\n is the thing like waiting and issues\n\n1:21:37.860 --> 1:21:42.100\n about the software development process.\n\n1:21:42.100 --> 1:21:45.820\n When faults happen, can you recover from them?\n\n1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:49.300\n What can you do to make it easier\n\n1:21:49.300 --> 1:21:54.700\n to create and eliminate complex data structures?\n\n1:21:54.700 --> 1:21:59.940\n What can you do to fix one of the most common C problems,\n\n1:21:59.940 --> 1:22:03.620\n which is storage leaks?\n\n1:22:03.620 --> 1:22:12.500\n And it's evil twin, the freed but still being used\n\n1:22:12.500 --> 1:22:14.340\n piece of memory.\n\n1:22:14.340 --> 1:22:17.780\n You free something and then you keep using it.\n\n1:22:17.780 --> 1:22:19.660\n Oh, yeah.\n\n1:22:19.660 --> 1:22:21.580\n So when I was originally thinking about that,\n\n1:22:21.580 --> 1:22:26.700\n I was thinking about it in terms of safety and security issues.\n\n1:22:26.700 --> 1:22:29.900\n And one of the things I came to understand\n\n1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:33.260\n was that it wasn't just about safety and security,\n\n1:22:33.260 --> 1:22:39.180\n but it was about developer velocity.\n\n1:22:39.180 --> 1:22:43.340\n So and I got really religious about this\n\n1:22:43.340 --> 1:22:46.620\n because at that point, I had spent an ungodly amount\n\n1:22:46.620 --> 1:22:54.900\n of my life hunting down mystery pointer bugs.\n\n1:22:54.900 --> 1:23:01.300\n And two thirds of my time as a software developer\n\n1:23:01.300 --> 1:23:03.900\n was because the mystery pointer bugs tend\n\n1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:07.900\n to be the hardest to find because they tend\n\n1:23:07.900 --> 1:23:11.820\n to be very, very statistical.\n\n1:23:11.820 --> 1:23:15.860\n The ones that hurt, they're like a one in a million chance.\n\n1:23:20.780 --> 1:23:23.420\n But nevertheless, create an infinite amount of suffering.\n\n1:23:23.420 --> 1:23:24.460\n Right.\n\n1:23:24.460 --> 1:23:28.740\n Because when you're doing a billion operations a second,\n\n1:23:28.740 --> 1:23:32.540\n one in a million chance means it's going to happen.\n\n1:23:35.260 --> 1:23:38.420\n And so I got really religious about this thing,\n\n1:23:38.420 --> 1:23:41.180\n about making it so that if something fails,\n\n1:23:41.180 --> 1:23:44.900\n it fails immediately and visibly.\n\n1:23:44.900 --> 1:23:52.780\n And one of the things that was a real attraction of Java\n\n1:23:52.780 --> 1:23:57.220\n to lots of development shops was that we get our code up\n\n1:23:57.220 --> 1:24:00.900\n and running twice as fast.\n\n1:24:00.900 --> 1:24:03.540\n You mean like the entirety of the development process,\n\n1:24:03.540 --> 1:24:04.900\n debugging, all that kind of stuff?\n\n1:24:04.900 --> 1:24:12.500\n Yeah, so if you measure time from you first touch fingers\n\n1:24:12.500 --> 1:24:19.580\n to keyboard until you get your first demo out,\n\n1:24:19.580 --> 1:24:21.140\n not much different.\n\n1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:23.620\n But if you look from fingers touching keyboard\n\n1:24:23.620 --> 1:24:27.900\n to solid piece of software that you could release\n\n1:24:27.900 --> 1:24:32.180\n in production, it would be way faster.\n\n1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:34.740\n And I think what people don't often realize is, yeah,\n\n1:24:34.740 --> 1:24:36.780\n there's things that really slow you down,\n\n1:24:36.780 --> 1:24:40.260\n like the hard to catch bugs probably\n\n1:24:40.260 --> 1:24:43.580\n is the thing that really slows down the entire time.\n\n1:24:43.580 --> 1:24:45.740\n It really slows things down.\n\n1:24:45.740 --> 1:24:48.540\n But also, one of the things that you get out\n\n1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:52.940\n of object oriented programming is a strict methodology\n\n1:24:52.940 --> 1:24:55.860\n about what are the interfaces between things\n\n1:24:55.860 --> 1:25:02.180\n and being really clear about how parts relate to each other.\n\n1:25:02.180 --> 1:25:06.940\n And what that helps with is so many times\n\n1:25:06.940 --> 1:25:12.540\n what people do is they kind of like sneak around the side.\n\n1:25:12.540 --> 1:25:16.980\n So if you've built something and people are using it\n\n1:25:16.980 --> 1:25:21.420\n and you say, well, OK, I built this thing.\n\n1:25:21.420 --> 1:25:23.740\n You use it this way.\n\n1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:26.180\n And then you change it in such a way\n\n1:25:26.180 --> 1:25:28.540\n that it still does what you said it does.\n\n1:25:28.540 --> 1:25:30.260\n It just does it a little bit different.\n\n1:25:30.260 --> 1:25:33.260\n Then you find out that somebody out there\n\n1:25:33.260 --> 1:25:35.660\n was sneaking around the side.\n\n1:25:35.660 --> 1:25:38.180\n They sort of tunneled in a back door.\n\n1:25:38.180 --> 1:25:41.860\n And this person, their code broke.\n\n1:25:41.860 --> 1:25:47.020\n And because they were sneaking through a side door.\n\n1:25:47.020 --> 1:25:56.380\n And normally, the attitude is, dummy.\n\n1:25:56.380 --> 1:26:04.740\n But a lot of times, you can't just slap their hand\n\n1:26:04.740 --> 1:26:06.740\n and tell them to not do that.\n\n1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:17.940\n Because it's some bank's account reconciliation system\n\n1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:22.780\n that some developer decided, oh, I'm lazy.\n\n1:26:22.780 --> 1:26:24.900\n I'll just sneak through the back door.\n\n1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:26.420\n Because the language allows it.\n\n1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:28.060\n I mean, you can't even mad at them.\n\n1:26:28.060 --> 1:26:32.020\n And so one of the things I did that, on the one hand,\n\n1:26:32.020 --> 1:26:34.540\n upset a bunch of people was I made it\n\n1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:38.740\n so that you really couldn't go through back doors.\n\n1:26:38.740 --> 1:26:44.340\n So the whole point of that was to say,\n\n1:26:44.340 --> 1:26:47.140\n if the interface here isn't right,\n\n1:26:47.140 --> 1:26:51.380\n the wrong way to deal with that is to go through a back door.\n\n1:26:51.380 --> 1:26:53.340\n The right way to deal with it is to walk up\n\n1:26:53.340 --> 1:26:58.860\n to the developer of this thing and say, fix it.\n\n1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:02.300\n And so it was kind of like a social engineering thing.\n\n1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:08.580\n And people ended up discovering that that really\n\n1:27:08.580 --> 1:27:12.340\n made a difference in terms of.\n\n1:27:12.340 --> 1:27:16.060\n And a bunch of this stuff, if you're just screwing around\n\n1:27:16.060 --> 1:27:20.900\n writing your own class project scale stuff,\n\n1:27:20.900 --> 1:27:25.460\n a lot of this stuff isn't quite so important\n\n1:27:25.460 --> 1:27:31.420\n because you're both sides of the interface.\n\n1:27:31.420 --> 1:27:37.740\n But when you're building larger, more complex pieces of software\n\n1:27:37.740 --> 1:27:39.940\n that have a lot of people working on them,\n\n1:27:39.940 --> 1:27:46.380\n and especially when they span organizations,\n\n1:27:46.380 --> 1:27:52.860\n having clarity about how that stuff gets structured\n\n1:27:52.860 --> 1:27:56.380\n saves your life.\n\n1:27:56.380 --> 1:28:00.180\n And especially, there's so much software\n\n1:28:00.180 --> 1:28:08.140\n that is fundamentally untestable until you do the real thing.\n\n1:28:08.140 --> 1:28:11.980\n It's better to write good code in the beginning\n\n1:28:11.980 --> 1:28:13.580\n as opposed to writing crappy code\n\n1:28:13.580 --> 1:28:17.260\n and then trying to fix it and trying to scramble and figure\n\n1:28:17.260 --> 1:28:20.300\n out, and through testing, figure out where the bugs are.\n\n1:28:20.300 --> 1:28:27.980\n Yeah, it's like, which shortcut caused that rocket\n\n1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:31.580\n to not get where it was needed to go?\n\n1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:38.260\n So I think one of the most beautiful ideas philosophically\n\n1:28:38.260 --> 1:28:45.220\n and technically is of a virtual machine, a Java virtual machine.\n\n1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:47.380\n Again, I apologize to romanticize things,\n\n1:28:47.380 --> 1:28:53.300\n but how did the idea of the JVM come to be?\n\n1:28:53.300 --> 1:28:56.380\n How to you radical of an idea it is?\n\n1:28:56.380 --> 1:29:01.460\n Because it seems to me to be just a really interesting idea\n\n1:29:01.460 --> 1:29:04.660\n in the history of programming.\n\n1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:05.660\n And what is it?\n\n1:29:05.660 --> 1:29:10.060\n So the Java virtual machine, you can think of it\n\n1:29:10.060 --> 1:29:17.060\n in different ways because it was carefully designed\n\n1:29:17.060 --> 1:29:19.820\n to have different ways of viewing it.\n\n1:29:19.820 --> 1:29:23.820\n So one view of it that most people don't really realize\n\n1:29:23.820 --> 1:29:30.580\n is there is that you can view it as sort\n\n1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:34.820\n of an encoding of the abstract syntax tree\n\n1:29:34.820 --> 1:29:36.300\n in reverse Polish notation.\n\n1:29:39.180 --> 1:29:41.380\n I don't know if that makes any sense at all.\n\n1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:44.820\n I could explain it, and that would blow all of our time.\n\n1:29:44.820 --> 1:29:47.620\n But the other way to think of it and the way\n\n1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:50.380\n that it ends up being explained is\n\n1:29:50.380 --> 1:29:57.180\n that it's like the instruction set of an abstract machine\n\n1:29:57.180 --> 1:30:00.380\n that's designed such that you can translate\n\n1:30:00.380 --> 1:30:03.820\n that abstract machine to a physical machine.\n\n1:30:03.820 --> 1:30:07.860\n And the reason that that's important,\n\n1:30:07.860 --> 1:30:10.460\n so if you wind back to the early 90s\n\n1:30:10.460 --> 1:30:15.260\n when we were talking to all of these companies doing\n\n1:30:15.260 --> 1:30:22.460\n consumer electronics, and you talk to the purchasing people,\n\n1:30:22.460 --> 1:30:27.900\n there were interesting conversations with purchasing.\n\n1:30:27.900 --> 1:30:31.940\n So if you look at how these devices come together,\n\n1:30:31.940 --> 1:30:36.100\n they're sheet metal and gears and circuit boards\n\n1:30:36.100 --> 1:30:40.620\n and capacitors and resistors and stuff.\n\n1:30:40.620 --> 1:30:46.180\n And everything you buy has multiple sources.\n\n1:30:46.180 --> 1:30:50.420\n So you can buy a capacitor from here.\n\n1:30:50.420 --> 1:30:52.780\n You can buy a capacitor from there.\n\n1:30:52.780 --> 1:30:57.700\n And you've got kind of a market so that you can actually\n\n1:30:57.700 --> 1:31:03.340\n get a decent price for a capacitor.\n\n1:31:03.340 --> 1:31:12.980\n But CPUs, and particularly in the early 90s,\n\n1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:17.700\n CPUs were all different and all proprietary.\n\n1:31:17.700 --> 1:31:22.620\n So if you use the chip from Intel,\n\n1:31:22.620 --> 1:31:28.060\n you had to be an Intel customer till the end of time.\n\n1:31:28.060 --> 1:31:31.500\n Because if you wrote a bunch of software,\n\n1:31:31.500 --> 1:31:36.780\n when you wrote software using whatever technique you wanted,\n\n1:31:36.780 --> 1:31:39.580\n and C was particularly bad about this\n\n1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:43.780\n because there was a lot of properties\n\n1:31:43.780 --> 1:31:48.340\n of the underlying machine that came through.\n\n1:31:48.340 --> 1:31:49.220\n So you were stuck.\n\n1:31:49.220 --> 1:31:50.660\n So the code you wrote, you were stuck\n\n1:31:50.660 --> 1:31:51.780\n to that particular machine.\n\n1:31:51.780 --> 1:31:54.300\n You were stuck to that particular machine,\n\n1:31:54.300 --> 1:31:56.980\n which meant that they couldn't decide,\n\n1:31:56.980 --> 1:32:01.500\n you know, Intel is screwing us.\n\n1:32:01.500 --> 1:32:08.220\n I'll start buying chips from Bob's Better Chips.\n\n1:32:08.220 --> 1:32:15.860\n This drove the purchasing people absolutely insane\n\n1:32:15.860 --> 1:32:20.540\n that they were welded into this decision.\n\n1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:22.980\n And they would have to make this decision\n\n1:32:22.980 --> 1:32:25.940\n before the first line of software was written.\n\n1:32:25.940 --> 1:32:28.140\n That's funny that you're talking about the purchasing people.\n\n1:32:28.140 --> 1:32:31.300\n So there's one perspective, right?\n\n1:32:31.300 --> 1:32:32.740\n There's a lot of other perspectives\n\n1:32:32.740 --> 1:32:35.260\n that all probably hated this idea.\n\n1:32:35.260 --> 1:32:36.060\n Right.\n\n1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:37.540\n But from a technical aspect,\n\n1:32:37.540 --> 1:32:41.740\n just like the creation of an abstraction layer\n\n1:32:41.740 --> 1:32:46.300\n that's agnostic to the underlying machine\n\n1:32:46.300 --> 1:32:48.340\n from the perspective of the developer,\n\n1:32:48.340 --> 1:32:50.100\n I mean, that's brilliant.\n\n1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:50.780\n Right.\n\n1:32:50.780 --> 1:32:56.300\n Well, and so that's like across the spectrum\n\n1:32:56.300 --> 1:32:58.500\n of providers of chips.\n\n1:32:58.500 --> 1:33:00.700\n But then there's also the time thing\n\n1:33:00.700 --> 1:33:04.820\n because, you know, as you went from one generation\n\n1:33:04.820 --> 1:33:06.820\n to the next generation to the next generation,\n\n1:33:06.820 --> 1:33:07.980\n they were all different.\n\n1:33:07.980 --> 1:33:10.180\n And you would often have to rewrite your software.\n\n1:33:10.180 --> 1:33:14.740\n Oh, you mean generations of machines of different kinds?\n\n1:33:14.740 --> 1:33:15.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:15.620 --> 1:33:19.820\n So like one of the things that sucked about a year out\n\n1:33:19.820 --> 1:33:27.660\n of my life was when Sun went from the Motorola 68010\n\n1:33:27.660 --> 1:33:31.660\n processor to the 68020 processor.\n\n1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:33.820\n Then they had a number of differences.\n\n1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:36.540\n And one of them hit us really hard.\n\n1:33:36.540 --> 1:33:41.820\n And I ended up being the point guy\n\n1:33:41.820 --> 1:33:46.340\n on the worst case of where the new instruction cache\n\n1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:49.060\n architecture hurt us.\n\n1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:53.300\n Well, OK, so I mean, so one of this idea, I mean, OK.\n\n1:33:53.300 --> 1:33:57.580\n So yeah, you articulate a really clear fundamental problem\n\n1:33:57.580 --> 1:33:59.100\n in all of computing.\n\n1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:03.180\n But where do you get the guts to think\n\n1:34:03.180 --> 1:34:05.180\n we can actually solve this?\n\n1:34:05.180 --> 1:34:09.580\n You know, in our conversations with all of these vendors,\n\n1:34:09.580 --> 1:34:14.100\n these problems started to show up.\n\n1:34:14.100 --> 1:34:23.500\n And I kind of had this epiphany because it reminded me\n\n1:34:23.500 --> 1:34:31.220\n of a summer job that I had had in grad school.\n\n1:34:31.220 --> 1:34:37.660\n So back in grad school, my thesis advisor,\n\n1:34:37.660 --> 1:34:42.900\n well, I had two thesis advisors for bizarre reasons.\n\n1:34:42.900 --> 1:34:44.900\n One of them was a guy named Raj Reddy.\n\n1:34:44.900 --> 1:34:48.340\n The other one was Bob Sproul.\n\n1:34:48.340 --> 1:34:53.020\n And Raj, I love Raj.\n\n1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:56.140\n I really love both of them.\n\n1:34:56.140 --> 1:35:06.300\n So the department had bought a bunch of early workstations\n\n1:35:06.300 --> 1:35:11.220\n from a company called Three Rivers Computer Company.\n\n1:35:11.220 --> 1:35:13.340\n And Three Rivers Computer Company\n\n1:35:13.340 --> 1:35:15.260\n was a bunch of electrical engineers\n\n1:35:15.260 --> 1:35:19.060\n who wanted to do as little software as possible.\n\n1:35:19.060 --> 1:35:23.580\n So they knew that they'd need to have compilers and an OS\n\n1:35:23.580 --> 1:35:24.380\n and stuff like that.\n\n1:35:24.380 --> 1:35:26.660\n And they didn't want to do any of that.\n\n1:35:26.660 --> 1:35:29.460\n And they wanted to do that for as close to zero money\n\n1:35:29.460 --> 1:35:31.260\n as possible.\n\n1:35:31.260 --> 1:35:39.380\n So what they did was they built a machine whose instruction set\n\n1:35:39.380 --> 1:35:50.420\n was literally the byte code for UCSD Pascal, the P code.\n\n1:35:50.420 --> 1:35:56.860\n And so we had a bunch of software\n\n1:35:56.860 --> 1:35:59.780\n that was written for this machine.\n\n1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:06.700\n And for various reasons, the company\n\n1:36:06.700 --> 1:36:08.340\n wasn't doing terrifically well.\n\n1:36:08.340 --> 1:36:10.100\n We had all this software on these machines.\n\n1:36:10.100 --> 1:36:13.260\n And we wanted it to run on other machines, principally\n\n1:36:13.260 --> 1:36:15.460\n the VAX.\n\n1:36:15.460 --> 1:36:23.140\n And so Raj asked me if I could come up\n\n1:36:23.140 --> 1:36:32.580\n with a way to port all of this software from the PERC machines\n\n1:36:32.580 --> 1:36:35.260\n to VAXs.\n\n1:36:35.260 --> 1:36:41.460\n And I think what he had in mind was something\n\n1:36:41.460 --> 1:36:50.740\n that would translate from Pascal to C or Pascal to, actually,\n\n1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:52.460\n at those times, pretty much it was\n\n1:36:52.460 --> 1:36:55.780\n you could translate to C or C. And if you\n\n1:36:55.780 --> 1:37:00.820\n didn't like translate to C, you could translate to C.\n\n1:37:00.820 --> 1:37:05.820\n There was, it's like the Henry Ford, any color you want,\n\n1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:09.300\n just as long as it's black.\n\n1:37:09.300 --> 1:37:15.140\n And I went, that's really hard.\n\n1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:16.500\n That's a.\n\n1:37:16.500 --> 1:37:20.660\n And I noticed that, and I was looking at stuff.\n\n1:37:20.660 --> 1:37:25.820\n And I went, oh, I bet I could rewrite the P code\n\n1:37:25.820 --> 1:37:29.580\n into VAX assembly code.\n\n1:37:29.580 --> 1:37:33.940\n And then I started to realize that there\n\n1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:36.060\n were some properties of P code that\n\n1:37:36.060 --> 1:37:39.500\n made that really easy, some properties that\n\n1:37:39.500 --> 1:37:40.820\n made it really hard.\n\n1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:42.940\n So I ended up writing this thing that\n\n1:37:42.940 --> 1:37:49.620\n translated from P code on the Three Rivers PERCs\n\n1:37:49.620 --> 1:37:53.820\n into assembly code on the VAX.\n\n1:37:53.820 --> 1:38:00.180\n And I actually got higher quality code than the C compiler.\n\n1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:03.260\n And so everything just got really fast.\n\n1:38:03.260 --> 1:38:04.340\n It was really easy.\n\n1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:08.660\n It was like, wow, I thought that was a sleazy hack\n\n1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:10.660\n because I was lazy.\n\n1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:13.980\n And in actual fact, it worked really well.\n\n1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:17.780\n And I tried to convince people that that was maybe\n\n1:38:17.780 --> 1:38:18.780\n a good thesis topic.\n\n1:38:18.780 --> 1:38:23.460\n And nobody was, it was like, nah.\n\n1:38:23.460 --> 1:38:23.980\n Really?\n\n1:38:23.980 --> 1:38:29.580\n That's, I mean, it's kind of a brilliant idea, right?\n\n1:38:29.580 --> 1:38:31.820\n Or maybe you didn't have the, you\n\n1:38:31.820 --> 1:38:34.460\n weren't able to articulate the big picture of it.\n\n1:38:34.460 --> 1:38:34.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:34.980 --> 1:38:39.940\n And I think that was a key part.\n\n1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:44.100\n But so then clock comes forward a few years.\n\n1:38:44.100 --> 1:38:48.980\n And it's like, we've got to be able to,\n\n1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:50.500\n if they want to be able to switch\n\n1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:55.300\n from this weird microprocessor to that weird and totally\n\n1:38:55.300 --> 1:38:58.460\n different microprocessor, how do you do that?\n\n1:38:58.460 --> 1:39:04.540\n And I kind of went, oh, maybe by doing something kind of\n\n1:39:04.540 --> 1:39:12.260\n in the space of Pascal P code, I could do multiple translations\n\n1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:15.460\n to multiple translators.\n\n1:39:15.460 --> 1:39:17.260\n And I spent some time thinking about that\n\n1:39:17.260 --> 1:39:19.780\n and thinking about what worked and what didn't work\n\n1:39:19.780 --> 1:39:25.620\n when I did the P code to Vax translator.\n\n1:39:25.620 --> 1:39:29.460\n And I talked to some of the folks\n\n1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:31.980\n who were involved in Smalltalk because Smalltalk also\n\n1:39:31.980 --> 1:39:34.780\n did a bytecode.\n\n1:39:34.780 --> 1:39:41.300\n And then I kind of went, yeah, I want to do that.\n\n1:39:41.300 --> 1:39:44.940\n Because that actually, and it had the other advantage\n\n1:39:44.940 --> 1:39:49.900\n that you could either interpret it or compile it.\n\n1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:55.940\n And interpreters are usually easier to do,\n\n1:39:55.940 --> 1:40:00.060\n but not as fast as a compiler.\n\n1:40:00.060 --> 1:40:03.460\n So I figured, good, I can be lazy again.\n\n1:40:06.820 --> 1:40:08.940\n Sometimes I think that most of my good ideas\n\n1:40:08.940 --> 1:40:12.340\n are driven by laziness.\n\n1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:15.860\n And often I find that some of people's stupidest ideas\n\n1:40:15.860 --> 1:40:17.660\n are because they're insufficiently lazy.\n\n1:40:21.660 --> 1:40:23.900\n They just want to build something really complicated.\n\n1:40:23.900 --> 1:40:26.740\n And it's like, it doesn't need to be that complicated.\n\n1:40:26.740 --> 1:40:30.380\n Yeah, and so that's how that came out.\n\n1:40:30.380 --> 1:40:39.140\n But that also turned into almost a religious position\n\n1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:44.300\n on my part, which got me in several other fights.\n\n1:40:44.300 --> 1:40:49.020\n So one of the things that was a real difference\n\n1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:51.020\n was the way that arithmetic worked.\n\n1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:59.620\n And once upon a time, it wasn't always just\n\n1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:01.540\n two's complement arithmetic.\n\n1:41:01.540 --> 1:41:03.580\n There were some machines that had one's complement\n\n1:41:03.580 --> 1:41:08.820\n arithmetic, which was like almost anything built by CDC.\n\n1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:10.660\n And occasionally, there were machines\n\n1:41:10.660 --> 1:41:13.100\n that were decimal arithmetic.\n\n1:41:13.100 --> 1:41:17.860\n And I was like, this is crazy.\n\n1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:22.580\n Pretty much two's complement integer arithmetic has one.\n\n1:41:22.580 --> 1:41:28.180\n So just do that.\n\n1:41:28.180 --> 1:41:31.180\n One of the other places where there was a lot of variability\n\n1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:33.060\n was in the way that floating point behaved.\n\n1:41:36.180 --> 1:41:40.780\n And that was causing people throughout the software\n\n1:41:40.780 --> 1:41:44.500\n industry much pain because you couldn't\n\n1:41:44.500 --> 1:41:47.380\n do a numerical computing library that\n\n1:41:47.380 --> 1:41:50.860\n would work on CDC and then have it work on an IBM machine\n\n1:41:50.860 --> 1:41:54.700\n and work on a DEC machine.\n\n1:41:54.700 --> 1:41:57.700\n And as a part of that whole struggle,\n\n1:41:57.700 --> 1:42:03.900\n there had been this big body of work on floating point\n\n1:42:03.900 --> 1:42:05.300\n standards.\n\n1:42:05.300 --> 1:42:11.660\n And this thing emerged that came to be called IEEE 754,\n\n1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:14.580\n which is the floating point standard that pretty much\n\n1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:17.700\n has taken over the entire universe.\n\n1:42:20.060 --> 1:42:21.860\n And at the time I was doing Java,\n\n1:42:21.860 --> 1:42:25.740\n it had pretty much completed taking over the universe.\n\n1:42:25.740 --> 1:42:28.180\n There were still a few pockets of holdouts,\n\n1:42:28.180 --> 1:42:32.100\n but I was like, it's important to be\n\n1:42:32.100 --> 1:42:33.700\n able to say what two plus two means.\n\n1:42:37.500 --> 1:42:42.380\n And so I went that.\n\n1:42:42.380 --> 1:42:46.180\n And one of the ways that I got into fights with people\n\n1:42:46.180 --> 1:42:50.380\n was that there were a few machines that did not\n\n1:42:50.380 --> 1:42:55.300\n implement IEEE 754 correctly.\n\n1:42:55.300 --> 1:42:58.500\n Well, of course, that's all short term kind of fights.\n\n1:42:58.500 --> 1:43:03.020\n I think in the long term, I think this vision is one out.\n\n1:43:03.020 --> 1:43:06.180\n Yeah, and I think it's worked out over time.\n\n1:43:06.180 --> 1:43:10.700\n I mean, the biggest fights were with Intel\n\n1:43:10.700 --> 1:43:15.380\n because they had done some strange things with rounding.\n\n1:43:15.380 --> 1:43:17.980\n They'd done some strange things with their transcendental\n\n1:43:17.980 --> 1:43:24.860\n functions, which turned into a mushroom cloud of weirdness.\n\n1:43:24.860 --> 1:43:29.100\n And in the name of optimization, but from the perspective\n\n1:43:29.100 --> 1:43:32.500\n of the developer, that's not good.\n\n1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:34.580\n Well, their issues with transcendental functions\n\n1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:35.740\n were just stupid.\n\n1:43:35.740 --> 1:43:39.340\n OK, so that's not even a trade off.\n\n1:43:39.340 --> 1:43:40.740\n That's just absolutely.\n\n1:43:40.740 --> 1:43:45.620\n Yeah, they were doing range reduction for sine and cosine\n\n1:43:45.620 --> 1:43:48.500\n using a slightly wrong value for pi.\n\n1:43:48.500 --> 1:43:49.580\n Got it.\n\n1:43:49.580 --> 1:43:50.580\n We've got 10 minutes.\n\n1:43:50.580 --> 1:43:53.460\n So in the interest of time, two questions.\n\n1:43:53.460 --> 1:43:55.380\n So one about Android and one about life.\n\n1:43:58.100 --> 1:44:02.300\n So one, I mean, we could talk for many more hours.\n\n1:44:02.300 --> 1:44:05.140\n I hope eventually we might talk again.\n\n1:44:05.140 --> 1:44:09.220\n But I got to ask you about Android and the use of Java\n\n1:44:09.220 --> 1:44:14.220\n there because it's one of the many places where Java just\n\n1:44:14.220 --> 1:44:16.380\n has a huge impact on this world.\n\n1:44:16.380 --> 1:44:19.780\n Just on your opinion, is there things\n\n1:44:19.780 --> 1:44:24.300\n that make you happy about the way Java\n\n1:44:24.300 --> 1:44:25.860\n is used in the Android world?\n\n1:44:25.860 --> 1:44:29.580\n And are there things that you wish were different?\n\n1:44:29.580 --> 1:44:32.660\n I don't know how to do a short answer to that.\n\n1:44:32.660 --> 1:44:34.500\n But I have to do a short answer to that.\n\n1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:38.980\n So I'm happy that they did it.\n\n1:44:38.980 --> 1:44:40.940\n Java had been running on cell phones\n\n1:44:40.940 --> 1:44:42.540\n at that time for quite a few years.\n\n1:44:42.540 --> 1:44:46.020\n And it worked really, really well.\n\n1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:49.260\n There were things about how they did it.\n\n1:44:49.260 --> 1:44:59.420\n And in particular, various ways that they kind of violated\n\n1:44:59.420 --> 1:45:00.540\n all kinds of contracts.\n\n1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:06.380\n The guy who led it, Andy Rubin, he crossed a lot of lines.\n\n1:45:06.380 --> 1:45:07.700\n There's some lines crossed.\n\n1:45:07.700 --> 1:45:11.820\n Yeah, lines were crossed that have since mushroomed\n\n1:45:11.820 --> 1:45:13.700\n into giant court cases.\n\n1:45:16.620 --> 1:45:19.740\n And they didn't need to do that.\n\n1:45:19.740 --> 1:45:23.220\n And in fact, it would have been so much cheaper for them\n\n1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:25.260\n to not cross lines.\n\n1:45:25.260 --> 1:45:28.260\n I mean, I suppose they didn't anticipate\n\n1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:34.540\n the success of this whole endeavor.\n\n1:45:34.540 --> 1:45:36.500\n Or do you think at that time it was already clear\n\n1:45:36.500 --> 1:45:38.820\n that this is going to blow up?\n\n1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:41.900\n I guess I sort of came to believe\n\n1:45:41.900 --> 1:45:44.420\n that it didn't matter what Andy did,\n\n1:45:44.420 --> 1:45:45.420\n it was going to blow up.\n\n1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:55.340\n I kind of started to think of him as a manufacturer of bombs.\n\n1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:01.500\n Yeah, some of the best things in this world\n\n1:46:01.500 --> 1:46:05.820\n come about through a little bit of explosive.\n\n1:46:05.820 --> 1:46:07.180\n Well, and some of the worst.\n\n1:46:07.180 --> 1:46:11.420\n And some of the worst, beautifully put.\n\n1:46:11.420 --> 1:46:13.260\n And like you said, I mean, does that\n\n1:46:13.260 --> 1:46:19.140\n make you proud that Java is in millions?\n\n1:46:19.140 --> 1:46:21.660\n I mean, it could be billions of devices.\n\n1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:24.940\n Yeah, well, I mean, it was in billions of phones\n\n1:46:24.940 --> 1:46:26.300\n before Android came along.\n\n1:46:26.300 --> 1:46:37.380\n And I'm just as proud of the way that the smart card standards\n\n1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:39.020\n adopted Java.\n\n1:46:39.020 --> 1:46:43.100\n And everybody involved in that did a really good job.\n\n1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:48.300\n And that's billions and billions.\n\n1:46:48.300 --> 1:46:49.300\n That's crazy.\n\n1:46:49.300 --> 1:46:54.220\n The SIM cards, the SIM cards in your pocket.\n\n1:46:54.220 --> 1:46:56.860\n I've been outside of that world for a decade.\n\n1:46:56.860 --> 1:46:59.980\n So I don't know how that has evolved.\n\n1:46:59.980 --> 1:47:04.340\n But it's just been crazy.\n\n1:47:04.340 --> 1:47:07.940\n So on that topic, let me ask, again,\n\n1:47:07.940 --> 1:47:12.260\n there's a million technical things we could talk about.\n\n1:47:12.260 --> 1:47:16.620\n But let me ask the absurd, the old philosophical question\n\n1:47:16.620 --> 1:47:17.300\n about life.\n\n1:47:20.060 --> 1:47:23.060\n What do you hope when you look back at your life\n\n1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:28.140\n and the people talk about you, write about you 500 years\n\n1:47:28.140 --> 1:47:31.140\n from now, what do you hope your legacy is?\n\n1:47:34.460 --> 1:47:39.820\n People not being afraid to take a leap of faith.\n\n1:47:39.820 --> 1:47:44.340\n I mean, I've got this kind of weird history\n\n1:47:44.340 --> 1:47:45.580\n of doing weird stuff.\n\n1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:49.220\n And it worked out pretty damn well.\n\n1:47:49.220 --> 1:47:50.820\n It worked out.\n\n1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:55.820\n And I think some of the weirder stuff that I've done\n\n1:47:55.820 --> 1:47:56.940\n has been the coolest.\n\n1:47:56.940 --> 1:47:59.940\n And some of it crashed and burned.\n\n1:47:59.940 --> 1:48:05.860\n And I think well over half of the stuff that I've done\n\n1:48:05.860 --> 1:48:09.540\n has crashed and burned, which has occasionally\n\n1:48:09.540 --> 1:48:12.060\n been really annoying.\n\n1:48:12.060 --> 1:48:13.580\n But still, you kept doing it.\n\n1:48:13.580 --> 1:48:15.060\n But yeah.\n\n1:48:15.060 --> 1:48:15.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:15.540 --> 1:48:16.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:16.020 --> 1:48:19.340\n And even when things crash and burn,\n\n1:48:19.340 --> 1:48:22.340\n you at least learn something from it.\n\n1:48:22.340 --> 1:48:27.180\n By way of advice, people, developers, engineers,\n\n1:48:27.180 --> 1:48:32.100\n scientists, or just people who are young, to look up to you,\n\n1:48:32.100 --> 1:48:37.660\n what advice would you give them how to approach their life?\n\n1:48:37.660 --> 1:48:39.620\n Don't be afraid of risk.\n\n1:48:39.620 --> 1:48:41.900\n It's OK to do stupid things once.\n\n1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:50.580\n Maybe a couple of times you get a pass on the first time\n\n1:48:50.580 --> 1:48:53.260\n or two that you do something stupid.\n\n1:48:53.260 --> 1:48:55.500\n The third or fourth time, yeah, not so much.\n\n1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:07.420\n But also, I don't know why, but really early on,\n\n1:49:07.420 --> 1:49:14.220\n I started to think about ethical choices in my life.\n\n1:49:14.220 --> 1:49:20.220\n And because I'm a big science fiction fan,\n\n1:49:20.220 --> 1:49:25.700\n I got to thinking about just about every technical decision\n\n1:49:25.700 --> 1:49:30.340\n I make in terms of, are you building\n\n1:49:30.340 --> 1:49:33.700\n Blade Runner or Star Trek?\n\n1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:34.540\n Which one's better?\n\n1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:38.820\n Which future would you rather live in?\n\n1:49:38.820 --> 1:49:40.380\n So what's the answer to that?\n\n1:49:40.380 --> 1:49:44.500\n Well, I would sure rather live in the universe of Star Trek.\n\n1:49:44.500 --> 1:49:46.100\n Star Trek, yeah.\n\n1:49:46.100 --> 1:49:48.180\n That opens up a whole topic about AI,\n\n1:49:48.180 --> 1:49:53.140\n but that's a really interesting idea.\n\n1:49:53.140 --> 1:49:58.140\n So your favorite AI system would be data from Star Trek.\n\n1:49:58.140 --> 1:50:00.700\n And my least favorite would easily be Skynet.\n\n1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:02.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:50:02.340 --> 1:50:03.060\n Beautifully put.\n\n1:50:03.060 --> 1:50:05.700\n I don't think there's a better way to end it, James.\n\n1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:08.100\n I can't say enough how much of an honor\n\n1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:09.540\n it is to meet you, to talk to you.\n\n1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:12.620\n Thanks so much for wasting your time with me today.\n\n1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:13.940\n Not a waste at all.\n\n1:50:13.940 --> 1:50:14.660\n Thanks, James.\n\n1:50:14.660 --> 1:50:16.580\n All right, thanks.\n\n1:50:16.580 --> 1:50:18.940\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with
