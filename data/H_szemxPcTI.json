00:08.320\n And even for the things that I work on,\n\n00:08.320 --> 00:11.200\n I don't have a set way that I do anything.\n\n00:11.200 --> 00:13.960\n I come to every project blank.\n\n00:13.960 --> 00:16.220\n Maybe you're just a meat vehicle\n\n00:16.220 --> 00:18.560\n and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else.\n\n00:18.560 --> 00:21.320\n I believe we know close to nothing,\n\n00:22.300 --> 00:25.480\n close to nothing, about anything.\n\n00:25.480 --> 00:27.760\n If we embrace that not knowing,\n\n00:27.760 --> 00:31.820\n we'll have a healthier experience going through life.\n\n00:34.320 --> 00:36.860\n The following is a conversation with Rick Rubin,\n\n00:36.860 --> 00:40.320\n one of the greatest music producers of all time,\n\n00:40.320 --> 00:43.640\n known for bringing the best out of anyone he works with,\n\n00:43.640 --> 00:47.080\n no matter the genre of music or even the medium of art,\n\n00:47.080 --> 00:48.720\n or just the medium of creating\n\n00:48.720 --> 00:50.940\n something beautiful in this world.\n\n00:50.940 --> 00:54.120\n And the list of musicians he produced includes many,\n\n00:54.120 --> 00:57.760\n many, many of the greats over the past 40 years,\n\n00:57.760 --> 01:01.760\n including the Beastie Boys, Eminem, Metallica,\n\n01:01.760 --> 01:04.640\n LL Cool J, Kanye West, Slayer, Tom Petty,\n\n01:04.640 --> 01:08.240\n Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Aerosmith, Adele,\n\n01:08.240 --> 01:10.360\n Danzig, Red Hot Chili Peppers,\n\n01:10.360 --> 01:13.660\n System of a Down, Jay Z, Black Sabbath.\n\n01:13.660 --> 01:16.520\n I can keep going for a very long time here.\n\n01:16.520 --> 01:20.600\n Most importantly, Rick is just an amazing human being.\n\n01:20.600 --> 01:23.840\n We became fast friends, which is surreal to say,\n\n01:23.840 --> 01:26.640\n and is just an incredible honor.\n\n01:26.640 --> 01:28.560\n I felt truly heard as a person\n\n01:28.560 --> 01:30.200\n when I spent the day with him\n\n01:30.200 --> 01:32.400\n eating some delicious Texas barbecue,\n\n01:32.400 --> 01:37.400\n talking about life, about music, about art, about beauty.\n\n01:37.520 --> 01:41.200\n This was a conversation and experience I will never forget.\n\n01:42.240 --> 01:44.320\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:44.320 --> 01:46.520\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:46.520 --> 01:47.760\n in the description.\n\n01:47.760 --> 01:51.240\n And now, dear friends, here's Rick Rubin.\n\n01:51.240 --> 01:53.720\n Are you nervous?\n\n01:53.720 --> 01:57.240\n I'm not shaky, but I would say I feel uneasy.\n\n01:57.240 --> 01:59.600\n And I feel like the sooner we start talking,\n\n01:59.600 --> 02:01.320\n the more relaxed we'll get.\n\n02:01.320 --> 02:02.200\n Yeah.\n\n02:02.200 --> 02:03.920\n Well, maybe we should sit in this moment\n\n02:03.920 --> 02:05.840\n and enjoy the nervousness of it.\n\n02:07.200 --> 02:08.740\n Let me start with Nietzsche.\n\n02:09.920 --> 02:12.920\n He said, without music, life would be a mistake.\n\n02:12.920 --> 02:14.660\n What do you think he means by that?\n\n02:14.660 --> 02:15.960\n Let's talk some philosophy.\n\n02:15.960 --> 02:20.960\n Let's try to analyze Friedrich Nietzsche from a century ago.\n\n02:22.020 --> 02:26.000\n It seems like music has the ability\n\n02:26.000 --> 02:31.000\n to bring us so much depth in our soul\n\n02:31.720 --> 02:33.760\n that's hard to access any other way.\n\n02:34.680 --> 02:37.200\n And without it, there would be a loss\n\n02:37.200 --> 02:39.500\n beyond the pleasure of it.\n\n02:41.560 --> 02:45.160\n Feels like it's a window into something else.\n\n02:45.160 --> 02:47.840\n Something that no other medium\n\n02:47.840 --> 02:51.000\n can express quite the same way.\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.040\n I would say not as automatically.\n\n02:53.040 --> 02:56.400\n Something about music can do it automatically.\n\n02:56.400 --> 03:01.400\n Maybe poetry or maybe certain abstract forms\n\n03:02.320 --> 03:04.620\n can get us there.\n\n03:04.620 --> 03:06.840\n But there's something about music\n\n03:06.840 --> 03:09.340\n that really can get us there quickly.\n\n03:09.340 --> 03:11.960\n But it's also the time, the place, the history.\n\n03:11.960 --> 03:15.160\n There's something about, like a lot of my family's\n\n03:15.160 --> 03:17.840\n still in Philly, there's something about driving\n\n03:18.800 --> 03:22.860\n through Jersey and listening to Bruce Springsteen.\n\n03:23.720 --> 03:25.840\n And then you just, I'll get emotional.\n\n03:27.160 --> 03:29.960\n Like listening to I'm On Fire.\n\n03:29.960 --> 03:33.840\n That like, one of my favorite Bruce Springsteen songs,\n\n03:33.840 --> 03:38.720\n there's a haunting kind of strumming to it.\n\n03:38.720 --> 03:41.720\n It's not a strumming, it's actually picked.\n\n03:41.720 --> 03:43.120\n It has a country feel to it,\n\n03:43.120 --> 03:45.160\n almost like a Johnny Cash feel actually.\n\n03:45.160 --> 03:47.600\n And it, I don't know, makes me feel,\n\n03:47.600 --> 03:50.040\n so for people who don't know, I'm On Fire.\n\n03:50.040 --> 03:55.040\n That song is, I guess, a love song to a woman\n\n03:56.860 --> 04:01.860\n that you can't have because she's married\n\n04:02.160 --> 04:03.760\n or she's with somebody else,\n\n04:03.760 --> 04:06.320\n which I guess is quite a lot of love songs.\n\n04:06.320 --> 04:08.480\n But there's something about the haunting nature\n\n04:08.480 --> 04:12.920\n of the guitar and then it has to be driving through Jersey.\n\n04:12.920 --> 04:16.000\n And I feel like everyone has fallen in love\n\n04:16.000 --> 04:18.920\n with a Jersey girl at one point in their life.\n\n04:18.920 --> 04:21.040\n I don't know if that's true for her,\n\n04:21.040 --> 04:22.440\n but I feel like that.\n\n04:22.440 --> 04:25.640\n I haven't either, but I just feel like that.\n\n04:25.640 --> 04:27.080\n There's something about Bruce Springsteen is like,\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:28.400\n yeah, I've been there.\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:33.680\n And that just takes you to a place of emotion\n\n04:33.680 --> 04:37.320\n that you just, that captures love,\n\n04:37.320 --> 04:40.880\n that captures longing, that captures the heartbreak\n\n04:40.880 --> 04:42.420\n of just the way time flows in life\n\n04:42.420 --> 04:43.560\n and the fact that it's finite\n\n04:43.560 --> 04:47.520\n and just all of that in a single simple song.\n\n04:47.520 --> 04:49.260\n What else can capture that?\n\n04:49.260 --> 04:50.720\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n04:50.720 --> 04:53.920\n But it's true that there's a connection\n\n04:53.920 --> 04:55.720\n both between time and place and music.\n\n04:55.720 --> 05:00.720\n And I, certain music growing up on the East Coast\n\n05:02.000 --> 05:03.280\n didn't really resonate with me\n\n05:03.280 --> 05:05.240\n until I spent time on the West Coast.\n\n05:05.240 --> 05:06.680\n Eagles being an example.\n\n05:06.680 --> 05:08.200\n When I lived in New York,\n\n05:08.200 --> 05:09.840\n the Eagles didn't really speak to me.\n\n05:09.840 --> 05:12.400\n ZZ Top didn't really speak to me.\n\n05:12.400 --> 05:14.640\n And then when I started spending time in California\n\n05:14.640 --> 05:16.840\n and driving through Laurel Canyon,\n\n05:16.840 --> 05:19.000\n all of a sudden the music of the Eagles felt\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:21.880\n appropriate somehow.\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:23.840\n And I started listening to it more.\n\n05:23.840 --> 05:24.680\n Got it.\n\n05:24.680 --> 05:26.080\n So not until you went out West\n\n05:26.080 --> 05:29.520\n can you understand the sounds of the West.\n\n05:29.520 --> 05:32.620\n So it's really like New York has a sound.\n\n05:32.620 --> 05:34.920\n What other places have a sound in the United States?\n\n05:34.920 --> 05:36.760\n I think every place does.\n\n05:36.760 --> 05:40.360\n And that said, sometimes we can get an experience\n\n05:40.360 --> 05:42.800\n through music of a place.\n\n05:42.800 --> 05:46.520\n Like we can resonate with the music and not understand why.\n\n05:46.520 --> 05:47.840\n And then maybe when we go to the place\n\n05:47.840 --> 05:49.800\n where it was created,\n\n05:49.800 --> 05:52.020\n it's almost like we have a knowingness of that place.\n\n05:52.020 --> 05:54.000\n It's not a strange place anymore.\n\n05:54.960 --> 05:58.960\n Yeah, Stevie Ray Vaughan with blues and Texas blues.\n\n05:58.960 --> 06:01.640\n You can just listen to Texas Flood and just,\n\n06:01.640 --> 06:03.880\n again, this is like a woman you're missing,\n\n06:03.880 --> 06:07.200\n a broken heart and somehow that connects to the place.\n\n06:07.200 --> 06:11.400\n The Eagles, what song with the Eagles connects with you?\n\n06:11.400 --> 06:15.520\n Are we talking about like Take It Easy\n\n06:15.520 --> 06:18.440\n or are we talking more like Hotel California?\n\n06:18.440 --> 06:21.240\n I'm thinking Take It Easy, but both are great.\n\n06:22.080 --> 06:23.760\n Yeah, there's certain songs\n\n06:23.760 --> 06:27.000\n when I started learning guitar when I was young\n\n06:27.000 --> 06:29.480\n that's like, I would like to be the kind of person\n\n06:29.480 --> 06:31.920\n that not only knows how to play this song,\n\n06:31.920 --> 06:36.720\n but understands the song and like have that song\n\n06:36.720 --> 06:39.160\n be something I played 20 years ago.\n\n06:40.480 --> 06:42.680\n And I've lived with that song for a while.\n\n06:42.680 --> 06:45.480\n Like Hotel California is an example.\n\n06:45.480 --> 06:47.480\n Obviously there's the solo,\n\n06:47.480 --> 06:50.360\n but there's also the soulfulness of the lyrics,\n\n06:50.360 --> 06:51.760\n which I still don't understand.\n\n06:51.760 --> 06:52.920\n And it could be about anything.\n\n06:52.920 --> 06:53.820\n And as you get older,\n\n06:53.820 --> 06:56.080\n I feel like the meaning of the song could be anything.\n\n06:56.080 --> 06:57.720\n Yeah, I think that's true.\n\n06:57.720 --> 06:59.040\n I think that's the beauty of them.\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:00.280\n I think when the person wrote them,\n\n07:00.280 --> 07:03.260\n they may have had one interpretation,\n\n07:04.800 --> 07:08.420\n but it's not contingent on us getting that interpretation\n\n07:08.420 --> 07:12.800\n to like it or resonate with it or feel it.\n\n07:12.800 --> 07:17.680\n In some ways, the best art is open enough\n\n07:18.780 --> 07:21.660\n where the artist gets to have their experience\n\n07:21.660 --> 07:22.500\n when they make it\n\n07:22.500 --> 07:24.480\n and then the audience gets to have their experience\n\n07:24.480 --> 07:26.880\n when they listen and they don't have to be the same.\n\n07:26.880 --> 07:28.360\n And then it connects thousands\n\n07:28.360 --> 07:30.960\n or millions of people together.\n\n07:30.960 --> 07:34.180\n There's a togetherness of music when you share that music,\n\n07:34.180 --> 07:36.840\n when you're listening to stuff together, like in a car.\n\n07:36.840 --> 07:39.720\n First of all, the car is a sacred place.\n\n07:39.720 --> 07:42.160\n So I work in part on autonomous vehicles.\n\n07:43.000 --> 07:44.600\n And you start to think, well,\n\n07:44.600 --> 07:46.780\n what are the things you lose\n\n07:46.780 --> 07:51.160\n when the car stops being the central part of American life?\n\n07:53.080 --> 07:54.880\n The car ownership.\n\n07:54.880 --> 07:57.780\n It just feels like the car, when you're alone,\n\n07:57.780 --> 08:01.080\n it's like a therapist thing, session,\n\n08:01.080 --> 08:04.960\n because you get angry at other humans\n\n08:04.960 --> 08:09.520\n and then you get to like sit in your own anger and emotion.\n\n08:09.520 --> 08:12.240\n You get to listen to the song on a long road trip\n\n08:12.240 --> 08:17.240\n and remember, like run through your memories, the heartbreak.\n\n08:18.840 --> 08:20.280\n I don't know, the one that got away,\n\n08:20.280 --> 08:23.440\n but also like the beautiful moments, all of it.\n\n08:23.440 --> 08:27.960\n Yeah, and all of that in the car.\n\n08:27.960 --> 08:30.780\n Yeah, driving also serves another purpose.\n\n08:30.780 --> 08:34.200\n And it's one of the things that we can do\n\n08:34.200 --> 08:39.200\n that we have to pay attention enough not to crash,\n\n08:41.160 --> 08:45.640\n but typically can essentially run on autopilot enough\n\n08:45.640 --> 08:47.560\n where we could be thinking about something else\n\n08:47.560 --> 08:50.560\n or concentrating on something else.\n\n08:50.560 --> 08:53.440\n And the difference between concentrating on something\n\n08:53.440 --> 08:55.520\n or trying to solve a problem\n\n08:55.520 --> 08:57.560\n when you're solely trying to solve a problem\n\n08:57.560 --> 08:59.600\n versus when you have some little task\n\n08:59.600 --> 09:01.920\n that's keeping you occupied,\n\n09:01.920 --> 09:06.920\n I find if I have something slight to take care of,\n\n09:09.020 --> 09:12.960\n it frees a more creative side of my mind\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:15.520\n to better solve problems.\n\n09:15.520 --> 09:17.220\n You know, I'm kind of jealous of people\n\n09:17.220 --> 09:19.700\n that found that in painting, for example.\n\n09:19.700 --> 09:22.680\n They'll be drawing or painting and listening to,\n\n09:22.680 --> 09:25.080\n so that's the small task you do.\n\n09:25.080 --> 09:27.400\n You're coloring in the lines.\n\n09:27.400 --> 09:31.600\n It's like this gentle, peaceful, slow process\n\n09:31.600 --> 09:33.780\n that requires just a small fraction of your mind\n\n09:33.780 --> 09:34.780\n and then you can listen.\n\n09:34.780 --> 09:36.980\n Some people listen to podcasts that way.\n\n09:36.980 --> 09:39.120\n Some people listen to music that way.\n\n09:39.120 --> 09:40.000\n Yeah.\n\n09:40.000 --> 09:40.960\n How do you do it?\n\n09:40.960 --> 09:42.940\n How do you free your mind?\n\n09:42.940 --> 09:47.940\n Yeah, running is one of them.\n\n09:51.940 --> 09:54.020\n There's a process.\n\n09:54.020 --> 09:57.100\n So most freeing of the mind for me\n\n09:57.100 --> 10:01.380\n has to go through a process of a bit of pain for a bit.\n\n10:01.380 --> 10:02.980\n So doing something difficult,\n\n10:04.020 --> 10:06.940\n so it's like an airplane taking off or something.\n\n10:06.940 --> 10:09.060\n So that's like, for example, running.\n\n10:09.060 --> 10:10.820\n The first few miles would just be,\n\n10:10.820 --> 10:14.700\n just first of all, the physical aspect,\n\n10:14.700 --> 10:16.340\n which is like, ah, you're so fat.\n\n10:16.340 --> 10:17.180\n You're out of shape.\n\n10:17.180 --> 10:20.060\n You're, this is the getting old, this, that.\n\n10:20.060 --> 10:21.860\n Okay, that slowly dissipates.\n\n10:21.860 --> 10:25.600\n And then the demons come in who are like,\n\n10:25.600 --> 10:30.020\n you should be getting this and that and this done.\n\n10:30.020 --> 10:31.400\n You haven't gotten it done.\n\n10:31.400 --> 10:33.580\n You're like breaking promises,\n\n10:33.580 --> 10:35.980\n all those kinds of voices coming in.\n\n10:35.980 --> 10:39.180\n And after that, maybe mile four,\n\n10:39.180 --> 10:40.980\n it's like, fuck it.\n\n10:40.980 --> 10:44.980\n You just run, run with the wind at a very slow pace,\n\n10:44.980 --> 10:47.920\n but with the wind, and then you could think.\n\n10:47.920 --> 10:50.900\n So it's the footsteps, the physical activity.\n\n10:50.900 --> 10:54.620\n Then you could deeply think about stuff, ideas,\n\n10:54.620 --> 10:56.980\n sort of design, whether it's program design stuff\n\n10:56.980 --> 11:00.260\n or like high level life decisions, all those kinds of things.\n\n11:00.260 --> 11:02.460\n I would say running.\n\n11:02.460 --> 11:05.580\n I used to build bridges from toothpicks.\n\n11:05.580 --> 11:07.780\n I used to be a thing.\n\n11:07.780 --> 11:08.860\n It's an engineering.\n\n11:08.860 --> 11:11.660\n I guess some people like glue together airplanes\n\n11:11.660 --> 11:13.060\n and stuff like that.\n\n11:13.060 --> 11:17.540\n But the bridges, it's such deeply honest work\n\n11:17.540 --> 11:18.980\n because at the end of it,\n\n11:18.980 --> 11:21.380\n you're gonna have to test that bridge\n\n11:21.380 --> 11:24.100\n and you're gonna see how good your work was.\n\n11:24.100 --> 11:26.660\n The little details, but also the big picture.\n\n11:26.660 --> 11:28.700\n Do you use glue or no?\n\n11:28.700 --> 11:30.740\n Yeah, use glue.\n\n11:30.740 --> 11:32.180\n So it's not pure physics.\n\n11:32.180 --> 11:36.760\n It's materials engineering too.\n\n11:36.760 --> 11:40.260\n Because the way you want to do it is\n\n11:40.260 --> 11:42.740\n you actually split the wood as thin as possible\n\n11:42.740 --> 11:43.940\n and then glue it back together\n\n11:43.940 --> 11:46.900\n because the glue is really strong,\n\n11:46.900 --> 11:49.020\n except for the arches and things like that.\n\n11:49.020 --> 11:50.700\n So you're building arch bridges,\n\n11:50.700 --> 11:52.260\n which is a whole nother skill\n\n11:52.260 --> 11:54.420\n because you have to bend the wood.\n\n11:54.420 --> 11:55.260\n And it's so cool\n\n11:55.260 --> 11:58.860\n because the thing can hold thousands of times its weight.\n\n11:58.860 --> 12:03.860\n And then you get to watch it explode at a certain point\n\n12:03.860 --> 12:07.420\n from the pressure and when you do a really good job,\n\n12:07.420 --> 12:11.620\n it doesn't explode in a kind of some weak point\n\n12:11.620 --> 12:14.660\n that you didn't anticipate just kind of starts cracking.\n\n12:14.660 --> 12:17.260\n Everything cracks, everything explodes.\n\n12:17.260 --> 12:20.420\n It's just pieces fly everywhere.\n\n12:20.420 --> 12:23.500\n And it's literally hundreds of hours of work\n\n12:23.500 --> 12:26.580\n just explode in front of you.\n\n12:26.580 --> 12:29.380\n And that's a metaphor for life maybe.\n\n12:29.380 --> 12:30.720\n And it's all for nothing,\n\n12:30.720 --> 12:34.920\n except for the journey that you took to get there.\n\n12:34.920 --> 12:37.560\n And no one understands.\n\n12:37.560 --> 12:40.640\n Speaking of which, back to Nietzsche,\n\n12:40.640 --> 12:42.240\n these questions are ridiculous.\n\n12:42.240 --> 12:46.000\n So you're gonna have to try to figure out\n\n12:46.000 --> 12:48.360\n what the heck I'm trying to do here.\n\n12:48.360 --> 12:49.700\n So Nietzsche also said,\n\n12:51.480 --> 12:53.160\n a line I love, which is,\n\n12:53.160 --> 12:54.960\n and those who were seen dancing\n\n12:54.960 --> 12:56.280\n were thought to be insane\n\n12:56.280 --> 12:58.240\n by those who could not hear the music.\n\n12:58.240 --> 13:02.520\n Do you, Rick Rubin, ever feel crazy?\n\n13:02.520 --> 13:05.860\n Or maybe you're the one who's sane\n\n13:05.860 --> 13:07.280\n and everybody else is crazy.\n\n13:07.280 --> 13:11.920\n You know that the dancing, the joy of the music,\n\n13:11.920 --> 13:13.960\n of just feeling the music\n\n13:13.960 --> 13:15.820\n and everybody else just doesn't understand.\n\n13:15.820 --> 13:17.680\n And this doesn't have to be literally about music.\n\n13:17.680 --> 13:21.240\n This is about art, about creation.\n\n13:21.240 --> 13:24.800\n I would say I feel different\n\n13:24.800 --> 13:28.640\n and it's hard to say\n\n13:28.640 --> 13:33.600\n it's like which side of the equation is crazy, you know?\n\n13:33.600 --> 13:37.080\n Did you ever find a group of people\n\n13:37.080 --> 13:39.140\n that you get, they get you?\n\n13:39.140 --> 13:39.980\n Yes.\n\n13:39.980 --> 13:42.080\n Is that what producing is essentially?\n\n13:42.080 --> 13:43.480\n Is you try to find the moments\n\n13:43.480 --> 13:45.520\n when you just get each other?\n\n13:45.520 --> 13:46.360\n No.\n\n13:46.360 --> 13:51.360\n I would say there are definitely certain artists\n\n13:56.640 --> 13:58.380\n with certain temperaments.\n\n13:58.380 --> 13:59.560\n When you're around them,\n\n13:59.560 --> 14:02.360\n it feels like you can finish each other's sentences.\n\n14:02.360 --> 14:04.840\n You know, just see the world the same way.\n\n14:04.840 --> 14:06.120\n Comedians as well.\n\n14:07.920 --> 14:12.920\n And that's not essential for the two of you together\n\n14:13.060 --> 14:14.700\n creating something special.\n\n14:14.700 --> 14:16.120\n No, no.\n\n14:16.120 --> 14:18.120\n So it could be attention too?\n\n14:18.120 --> 14:18.960\n It could be anything.\n\n14:18.960 --> 14:21.480\n It could be any, there's no rules.\n\n14:21.480 --> 14:24.160\n It'd be like, think of it like a coach.\n\n14:24.160 --> 14:29.160\n A coach could bring what they have to bring\n\n14:29.520 --> 14:31.640\n to any talented individual\n\n14:31.640 --> 14:35.600\n and help them find their way.\n\n14:36.900 --> 14:40.400\n And sometimes the right coach for the right athlete\n\n14:40.400 --> 14:44.080\n really works and other times there's a mismatch.\n\n14:44.080 --> 14:46.640\n Have you seen the movie Whiplash?\n\n14:46.640 --> 14:47.480\n I did.\n\n14:47.480 --> 14:48.300\n I saw it when it came out\n\n14:48.300 --> 14:49.920\n so I don't really remember it well, but I did see it.\n\n14:49.920 --> 14:51.640\n So there's a coach type of figure.\n\n14:51.640 --> 14:52.480\n Yes.\n\n14:52.480 --> 14:56.100\n Who is pushing a drummer to create,\n\n14:56.100 --> 15:00.120\n to grow as a musician, but also to create something special.\n\n15:00.120 --> 15:02.280\n I don't know if it's even special music skill wise,\n\n15:02.280 --> 15:04.040\n it's a special moment.\n\n15:04.040 --> 15:06.020\n I don't know what he's trying to create.\n\n15:06.020 --> 15:08.120\n From one perspective, it's just an abusive,\n\n15:08.120 --> 15:11.240\n a person who selfishly gets off on being abusive\n\n15:11.240 --> 15:12.640\n to those he's with.\n\n15:12.640 --> 15:15.680\n But from another perspective, the way I saw that movie,\n\n15:15.680 --> 15:20.360\n is it's just the two right humans finding each other\n\n15:20.360 --> 15:21.760\n at the right moment in life\n\n15:21.760 --> 15:24.340\n and risking destroying each other in the process,\n\n15:24.340 --> 15:27.700\n but maybe something beautiful will come of it.\n\n15:29.140 --> 15:31.960\n Do you think that's a toxic relationship?\n\n15:32.920 --> 15:37.600\n Or is there, does some of that movie resonate with you\n\n15:37.600 --> 15:41.440\n as that sometimes is required to create art?\n\n15:41.440 --> 15:43.640\n That kind of suffering.\n\n15:43.640 --> 15:44.920\n Yeah, it doesn't.\n\n15:44.920 --> 15:46.120\n Well, there's suffering involved,\n\n15:46.120 --> 15:47.620\n but not that kind of suffering.\n\n15:49.800 --> 15:50.640\n Not for me.\n\n15:50.640 --> 15:53.160\n There are some people who that's their process\n\n15:53.160 --> 15:55.320\n and that's whatever works.\n\n15:55.320 --> 15:59.000\n There's no right answers for anything involved in art.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:02.400\n We're all trying experiments to find a way.\n\n16:02.400 --> 16:04.220\n And even for the things that I work on,\n\n16:04.220 --> 16:07.080\n I don't have a set way that I do anything.\n\n16:07.080 --> 16:10.400\n I come to every project blank\n\n16:10.400 --> 16:13.720\n and see,\n\n16:15.120 --> 16:18.960\n I really listen to what the artist plays and says\n\n16:18.960 --> 16:23.960\n and through what they explain they wanna do,\n\n16:26.840 --> 16:29.380\n help find the best way to get there.\n\n16:30.600 --> 16:32.920\n Was it implicit in the movie\n\n16:32.920 --> 16:37.920\n that the mean teacher liked being a mean teacher?\n\n16:37.920 --> 16:41.440\n You said the way you described it was\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:43.360\n that he got off on treating people this way.\n\n16:43.360 --> 16:44.560\n Do we know that to be the case?\n\n16:44.560 --> 16:45.400\n I don't remember that in the movie.\n\n16:45.400 --> 16:47.960\n No, but we sometimes project that onto people,\n\n16:47.960 --> 16:52.240\n people who are really rough on students.\n\n16:52.240 --> 16:54.100\n You start to think, well, maybe,\n\n16:58.760 --> 17:01.040\n maybe that is fundamentally who they are\n\n17:01.040 --> 17:03.520\n and if it's fundamentally who they are,\n\n17:03.520 --> 17:05.200\n that there must be some pleasure in it\n\n17:05.200 --> 17:07.500\n or it's an addiction of some sort.\n\n17:07.500 --> 17:12.500\n But it could be also a deliberate choice\n\n17:12.680 --> 17:14.040\n made by the teacher.\n\n17:14.040 --> 17:15.400\n It also could be a lineage.\n\n17:15.400 --> 17:18.040\n Like in the Zen tradition,\n\n17:18.040 --> 17:23.040\n there are sort of the mean Roshi's\n\n17:23.200 --> 17:27.400\n who if you do something wrong, take a physical action.\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:30.760\n And it's just in the lineage,\n\n17:30.760 --> 17:34.240\n it's considered that's how you teach.\n\n17:34.240 --> 17:37.560\n I didn't come from that lineage.\n\n17:37.560 --> 17:39.760\n So I'm much more of a,\n\n17:39.760 --> 17:43.060\n I feel like it's more of a collaboration\n\n17:43.060 --> 17:46.560\n between people working together to make the best thing.\n\n17:46.560 --> 17:51.520\n It's not a boss slave relationship at all.\n\n17:51.520 --> 17:55.080\n It's much more of a let's find our way.\n\n17:55.080 --> 17:57.760\n And we agree at the beginning of the process\n\n17:57.760 --> 18:02.160\n that if either of us or any of us\n\n18:02.160 --> 18:04.480\n don't like what's happening, we say it.\n\n18:04.480 --> 18:05.800\n And the goal is to keep working\n\n18:05.800 --> 18:09.440\n till we get to a point where we're all really happy with it.\n\n18:09.440 --> 18:11.040\n It's like if we make something\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:13.080\n that an artist likes and I don't like,\n\n18:13.080 --> 18:14.820\n or that I like and they don't like,\n\n18:14.820 --> 18:16.240\n we haven't gone far enough.\n\n18:17.600 --> 18:19.040\n In terms of lineage,\n\n18:19.040 --> 18:21.280\n the ones that seek destruction\n\n18:21.280 --> 18:22.560\n and the ones that seek happiness\n\n18:22.560 --> 18:23.760\n all come from the same lineage.\n\n18:23.760 --> 18:24.760\n We all came from fish.\n\n18:24.760 --> 18:28.500\n So somewhere in you, deep down there,\n\n18:28.500 --> 18:30.380\n there's the other stuff too.\n\n18:30.380 --> 18:33.800\n It's just that you haven't been yet, by the way,\n\n18:33.800 --> 18:35.280\n because you said every new project,\n\n18:35.280 --> 18:37.240\n including maybe starting today,\n\n18:39.560 --> 18:43.040\n is an opportunity to channel, to plug into something\n\n18:43.040 --> 18:43.880\n that was always there\n\n18:43.880 --> 18:46.080\n and you haven't gotten a chance to plug into.\n\n18:46.080 --> 18:47.400\n You mentioned listening.\n\n18:47.400 --> 18:49.600\n How do you listen to a person?\n\n18:49.600 --> 18:51.440\n How do you hear a person?\n\n18:51.440 --> 18:54.520\n When you first come in, like we just met,\n\n18:55.560 --> 18:57.720\n what's the analysis happening?\n\n18:57.720 --> 18:59.800\n But I mean, with me is one thing.\n\n18:59.800 --> 19:00.960\n I'm an artist of sorts.\n\n19:00.960 --> 19:05.960\n I program and I'm just, I'm human, I guess.\n\n19:06.680 --> 19:08.680\n I guess we're all creating art.\n\n19:08.680 --> 19:10.680\n How do you see, like, how do I bring out?\n\n19:10.680 --> 19:12.660\n So for people who don't know,\n\n19:14.820 --> 19:16.520\n I mean, obviously everyone knows\n\n19:16.520 --> 19:19.040\n that you've produced some of the greatest records ever,\n\n19:19.040 --> 19:24.040\n but the way I see that is you just brought out the best\n\n19:24.960 --> 19:27.520\n in a lot of interesting artists.\n\n19:27.520 --> 19:31.200\n And so in order to bring out the best in them,\n\n19:31.200 --> 19:33.540\n you have to understand them.\n\n19:33.540 --> 19:38.120\n You have to hear the music of their soul,\n\n19:38.120 --> 19:39.800\n hopefully not being too romantic here,\n\n19:39.800 --> 19:44.200\n but just like, is there something you can say\n\n19:45.580 --> 19:48.600\n of how difficult that is, if there's a process,\n\n19:48.600 --> 19:51.840\n if there's tricks, if it's luck?\n\n19:52.840 --> 19:56.240\n I think it starts with this, again, coming in blank,\n\n19:56.240 --> 19:59.440\n like not having any preconceived ideas,\n\n19:59.440 --> 20:01.840\n being open and really listening,\n\n20:01.840 --> 20:05.960\n listening and not thinking about what you're gonna say next\n\n20:05.960 --> 20:08.140\n or what your opinion is or any, you know,\n\n20:08.140 --> 20:12.040\n not basically being a recorder\n\n20:12.040 --> 20:14.040\n and just hearing what comes in.\n\n20:14.040 --> 20:16.180\n And then once you hear what comes in,\n\n20:16.180 --> 20:19.160\n processing that information\n\n20:19.160 --> 20:22.160\n and trying our best to do that\n\n20:22.160 --> 20:25.780\n without any of the beliefs that we might have\n\n20:25.780 --> 20:27.680\n to impact what that is.\n\n20:28.720 --> 20:32.000\n If I ask you a question, I don't wanna hear what,\n\n20:32.000 --> 20:34.080\n I don't wanna listen to you\n\n20:34.080 --> 20:38.000\n and have any reaction happening when you're speaking.\n\n20:38.000 --> 20:41.120\n I wanna be as neutral as possible.\n\n20:41.120 --> 20:46.120\n For me, my goal is not to form an opinion,\n\n20:46.960 --> 20:48.920\n it's to understand.\n\n20:48.920 --> 20:52.440\n So if anything, I would draw you out further\n\n20:52.440 --> 20:55.940\n and just ask questions to really understand.\n\n20:56.960 --> 20:58.800\n And if you say, or if you say something\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:03.800\n that somehow triggers me in a way that that's, you know,\n\n21:05.560 --> 21:08.200\n I wonder how he came to that.\n\n21:08.200 --> 21:11.080\n I wouldn't challenge you, I would ask,\n\n21:11.080 --> 21:12.480\n like, how did you find that?\n\n21:12.480 --> 21:14.920\n You know, how did you get to that place?\n\n21:14.920 --> 21:17.360\n From a place of curiosity, you would try to figure out.\n\n21:17.360 --> 21:20.360\n Yeah, I wanna understand who the person is.\n\n21:20.360 --> 21:22.680\n And through questioning, we can usually get there.\n\n21:22.680 --> 21:26.240\n Or through just spending time together,\n\n21:26.240 --> 21:29.280\n you find out who the person is.\n\n21:29.280 --> 21:31.760\n What about finding out and figuring out\n\n21:31.760 --> 21:33.520\n how to then take the next steps\n\n21:33.520 --> 21:36.100\n of bringing out the best in them?\n\n21:37.800 --> 21:40.060\n Like, is it just trial and error?\n\n21:40.060 --> 21:41.280\n Like, let's try this.\n\n21:41.280 --> 21:42.840\n It's definitely trial and error.\n\n21:42.840 --> 21:44.240\n It's always trial and error.\n\n21:45.200 --> 21:46.720\n Are you afraid of making a mistake?\n\n21:46.720 --> 21:48.760\n Like, let's add this instrument,\n\n21:48.760 --> 21:50.440\n let's remove this instrument.\n\n21:50.440 --> 21:52.560\n Let's add this line, let's remove this line.\n\n21:52.560 --> 21:53.380\n Let's try.\n\n21:53.380 --> 21:55.400\n And let's be open.\n\n21:55.400 --> 21:59.840\n So one of the, we don't really have rules,\n\n21:59.840 --> 22:03.000\n but one of the agreements in the studio is\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:07.820\n any idea that anyone has will always demonstrate it,\n\n22:07.820 --> 22:09.640\n will always try it.\n\n22:09.640 --> 22:12.000\n Because I can describe to you an idea\n\n22:12.000 --> 22:14.520\n and you can think, that's a terrible idea,\n\n22:14.520 --> 22:16.380\n let's not do that.\n\n22:16.380 --> 22:18.080\n And then I can play you the idea\n\n22:18.080 --> 22:19.560\n and then you can say, oh, that's really good.\n\n22:19.560 --> 22:22.020\n And it's completely different because we,\n\n22:22.020 --> 22:25.080\n when we hear, when we're told something,\n\n22:25.080 --> 22:28.840\n we have to imagine what that is\n\n22:28.840 --> 22:30.920\n and the way you see something and imagine it\n\n22:30.920 --> 22:32.280\n and the way I see something and imagine it\n\n22:32.280 --> 22:33.480\n are completely different.\n\n22:33.480 --> 22:36.400\n So you say a thing and now there's two humans\n\n22:36.400 --> 22:39.200\n that play that thing in their mind differently,\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:43.060\n in their imagination, and then there's a cool creative step\n\n22:43.060 --> 22:44.640\n and when you actually do it,\n\n22:44.640 --> 22:46.640\n to see how it differs in the imagination,\n\n22:46.640 --> 22:49.200\n and then the difference or the commonality\n\n22:49.200 --> 22:52.040\n will be like an exciting little discovery together.\n\n22:52.040 --> 22:55.020\n Well, so many groups of people\n\n22:55.020 --> 22:57.180\n making things together in a room,\n\n22:57.180 --> 22:59.220\n one person will suggest something\n\n22:59.220 --> 23:00.200\n and someone else in the room say,\n\n23:00.200 --> 23:01.840\n ah, that doesn't sound like a good idea,\n\n23:01.840 --> 23:03.880\n let's not do that, and then they move on.\n\n23:05.200 --> 23:07.780\n The testing of every idea is really important\n\n23:07.780 --> 23:09.760\n and that's how you get to see,\n\n23:09.760 --> 23:11.640\n oh, that's not at all what I thought it was gonna be.\n\n23:11.640 --> 23:13.420\n Happens to me all the time, I know,\n\n23:13.420 --> 23:16.760\n because someone will suggest, why don't we do it like this?\n\n23:16.760 --> 23:19.760\n And I'll think, that sounds bad,\n\n23:19.760 --> 23:21.280\n and then I'll think, okay, let's try it,\n\n23:21.280 --> 23:24.560\n and then we hear it, and then eight times out of 10,\n\n23:24.560 --> 23:26.680\n it's nothing like I imagined and great.\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:29.480\n And then you try not to have an ego\n\n23:29.480 --> 23:31.260\n about the fact that you thought\n\n23:31.260 --> 23:33.520\n it was not a good idea in your head.\n\n23:33.520 --> 23:36.860\n There can't be any ego in this.\n\n23:36.860 --> 23:41.860\n It doesn't, if everyone's there\n\n23:41.860 --> 23:45.780\n with the purpose of making the best thing we can,\n\n23:47.980 --> 23:49.260\n there's nothing else.\n\n23:49.260 --> 23:51.960\n There are no, there can't be any boundaries to that.\n\n23:53.580 --> 23:56.020\n So there's a moment I saw with,\n\n23:56.020 --> 23:58.220\n I know you don't love talking\n\n23:58.220 --> 24:00.900\n about previous things you've done,\n\n24:00.900 --> 24:02.820\n but it's cool to dive in there every once in a while.\n\n24:02.820 --> 24:04.060\n I'm fine to talk about anything.\n\n24:04.060 --> 24:06.900\n To sample it, anything?\n\n24:06.900 --> 24:07.740\n We'll see.\n\n24:07.740 --> 24:09.140\n I have this pain I gotta talk now.\n\n24:09.140 --> 24:12.540\n I'll think of something ridiculous\n\n24:12.540 --> 24:14.880\n that would make you change your mind.\n\n24:16.460 --> 24:19.820\n You mentioned, I saw a video of you with Jay Z\n\n24:19.820 --> 24:23.400\n at Workaround 99 Problems where you suggested acapella,\n\n24:23.400 --> 24:25.380\n opening the song with acapella,\n\n24:25.380 --> 24:28.140\n just no instruments, just voice.\n\n24:28.140 --> 24:33.140\n That to me, I mean, that's one of the characteristics\n\n24:33.380 --> 24:36.380\n of the things, of the ways you've brought out\n\n24:36.380 --> 24:38.680\n the best in artists is doing less.\n\n24:38.680 --> 24:43.140\n Sort of the tending towards simplicity in some kind of way.\n\n24:43.140 --> 24:45.620\n So that choice of acapella is really interesting\n\n24:45.620 --> 24:47.580\n because I could see a lot of people think\n\n24:47.580 --> 24:49.220\n that that's a bad idea,\n\n24:50.180 --> 24:52.260\n but it turned out to be a really powerful idea.\n\n24:52.260 --> 24:55.380\n Can you maybe talk about the simplicity,\n\n24:55.380 --> 24:58.900\n how to find simplicity, why you find simplicity is beautiful.\n\n24:58.900 --> 25:00.820\n It does appear to be beautiful.\n\n25:00.820 --> 25:01.840\n What is that?\n\n25:01.840 --> 25:04.180\n Yeah, I don't know where it comes from.\n\n25:04.180 --> 25:07.420\n It has been with me from the beginning of my work,\n\n25:07.420 --> 25:10.800\n the very first album I ever produced,\n\n25:10.800 --> 25:12.820\n the credit I took was reduced by me\n\n25:12.820 --> 25:16.540\n instead of produced by me for that reason.\n\n25:16.540 --> 25:19.460\n I like the idea of getting to the essential\n\n25:19.460 --> 25:24.460\n and I have a better idea now that I've done it for a while,\n\n25:24.580 --> 25:28.900\n but at the time it was purely an instinctual thing.\n\n25:28.900 --> 25:33.060\n And part of it is a sonic, there's a sonic benefit,\n\n25:33.060 --> 25:38.060\n which is the less elements you have, you can hear each\n\n25:39.020 --> 25:42.900\n of the ones that are there and they can sound better.\n\n25:42.900 --> 25:47.180\n And the less there are, the more space they could have\n\n25:47.180 --> 25:49.860\n around them and the more you can hear their personality.\n\n25:49.860 --> 25:54.860\n If you were to record 10 people playing the same guitar part\n\n25:55.400 --> 25:58.660\n and you listened to it, it would sound like guitar.\n\n25:58.660 --> 26:02.740\n And if you record one person playing a guitar part,\n\n26:02.740 --> 26:05.580\n it sounds like a person playing the guitar.\n\n26:05.580 --> 26:07.400\n It's different than just guitar.\n\n26:08.300 --> 26:13.300\n And often in the studio, the idea of building upon things\n\n26:14.500 --> 26:18.440\n and adding layers to thicken, to make it sound bigger,\n\n26:18.440 --> 26:23.440\n sometimes the more things you add, the smaller it gets.\n\n26:24.000 --> 26:27.460\n So a lot of it is counterintuitive\n\n26:27.460 --> 26:30.940\n until you just in practice see what works.\n\n26:30.940 --> 26:33.740\n Try it, to try removing stuff until it's just right.\n\n26:33.740 --> 26:38.740\n It's the Einstein thing, make it as simple as possible,\n\n26:39.260 --> 26:40.820\n but not simpler.\n\n26:40.820 --> 26:44.460\n That's such a, like finding a stopping place,\n\n26:44.460 --> 26:47.460\n just keep chopping away and chopping away.\n\n26:47.460 --> 26:49.580\n Yeah, there's something we also like to do\n\n26:49.580 --> 26:51.460\n called the ruthless edit, which is,\n\n26:51.460 --> 26:55.100\n let's say you're at a point where it can work for anything,\n\n26:55.100 --> 26:57.300\n but I'll give you the example with an album.\n\n26:57.300 --> 27:02.300\n We've recorded 25 songs.\n\n27:02.580 --> 27:05.100\n We think the album is gonna have 10.\n\n27:05.100 --> 27:08.080\n Instead of picking our favorite 10,\n\n27:08.080 --> 27:11.900\n we limit it to what are the five or six\n\n27:11.900 --> 27:13.260\n that we can't live without.\n\n27:14.300 --> 27:19.300\n So going past even the goal to get to the real heart of it\n\n27:20.780 --> 27:22.500\n and then see, okay, we have these five or six\n\n27:22.500 --> 27:24.260\n that we can't live without.\n\n27:24.260 --> 27:28.220\n Now, what would we add to that\n\n27:28.220 --> 27:31.220\n that makes it better and not worse?\n\n27:34.780 --> 27:38.540\n It's just, it puts you in a different frame\n\n27:38.540 --> 27:42.860\n when you start with building instead of removing.\n\n27:42.860 --> 27:45.380\n And you might find that there's nothing you need to add.\n\n27:45.380 --> 27:48.900\n Sometimes, sometimes something happens\n\n27:48.900 --> 27:51.360\n when you get to the real essence.\n\n27:51.360 --> 27:52.720\n Then when you start adding things back,\n\n27:52.720 --> 27:56.820\n it becomes clear that it was just supposed to be\n\n27:56.820 --> 27:59.180\n this tight little thing.\n\n28:00.140 --> 28:02.220\n Can I ask you like a therapy session question?\n\n28:02.220 --> 28:05.660\n So you mentioned somewhere that one way\n\n28:05.660 --> 28:09.940\n to kind of think about music to get into music\n\n28:09.940 --> 28:12.920\n is to look at the top like 100 albums of all time\n\n28:12.920 --> 28:14.940\n and just go down the list and like,\n\n28:14.940 --> 28:17.620\n just take it all in like one piece of artwork.\n\n28:17.620 --> 28:20.100\n So I was doing that for a while.\n\n28:20.100 --> 28:21.500\n It's a cool experiment,\n\n28:21.500 --> 28:23.420\n because unfortunately I have to admit\n\n28:23.420 --> 28:28.040\n I've gotten lazy and stopped taking in albums as albums.\n\n28:29.700 --> 28:32.780\n And I looked at one interesting top 100 list,\n\n28:32.780 --> 28:36.860\n top 500 actually, which is put together by Rolling Stone.\n\n28:36.860 --> 28:39.780\n And they put, this is the therapy session part,\n\n28:39.780 --> 28:41.300\n and this has to do with simplicity too.\n\n28:41.300 --> 28:44.100\n They put Marvin Gaye's What's Going On at number one.\n\n28:44.100 --> 28:44.960\n Spoiler alert.\n\n28:46.100 --> 28:50.940\n So I'd like to maybe get your opinion on that choice.\n\n28:50.940 --> 28:53.500\n The reason that Marvin Gaye is really interesting,\n\n28:54.540 --> 28:57.780\n it'd actually be cool to play What's Going On in a second,\n\n28:57.780 --> 29:02.660\n but when you just listen to his like acapella,\n\n29:02.660 --> 29:06.080\n just listen to his voice, it is really good.\n\n29:06.080 --> 29:09.580\n Like people, it makes me wonder if it's possible\n\n29:09.580 --> 29:13.220\n to pull off like most of his songs with no instruments.\n\n29:13.220 --> 29:17.800\n Like in many parts, there's so much soul\n\n29:17.800 --> 29:21.820\n in just Mercy, Mercy, Me, What's Going On.\n\n29:21.820 --> 29:23.700\n There's so many songs that you could just be like,\n\n29:23.700 --> 29:28.180\n I wonder if you could just like, just go raw,\n\n29:28.180 --> 29:30.380\n or maybe in parts, or maybe do what you do with Jay Z,\n\n29:30.380 --> 29:31.420\n just open up with nothing.\n\n29:31.420 --> 29:33.740\n Anyway, there's something so powerful\n\n29:33.740 --> 29:36.180\n to a great soulful voice.\n\n29:36.180 --> 29:37.800\n Do you mind if I play it real quick?\n\n29:37.800 --> 29:38.640\n No, please.\n\n29:38.640 --> 29:39.480\n What's going on?\n\n29:39.480 --> 29:41.340\n This is probably one of my favorite songs.\n\n29:41.340 --> 29:42.440\n I mean, it's up there.\n\n29:43.540 --> 29:44.380\n Hey, what's happening?\n\n29:44.380 --> 29:45.200\n What's up, brother?\n\n29:45.200 --> 29:46.040\n What's up?\n\n29:46.040 --> 29:46.880\n Hey, how you doing?\n\n29:46.880 --> 29:49.280\n Hey man.\n\n29:49.280 --> 29:54.020\n Wow.\n\n29:54.020 --> 29:58.860\n Hey man.\n\n29:58.860 --> 30:00.820\n Mother, mother,\n\n30:00.820 --> 30:02.620\n That voice.\n\n30:02.620 --> 30:08.660\n There's too many of you to cry.\n\n30:08.660 --> 30:11.660\n Brother, brother, brother.\n\n30:11.660 --> 30:14.440\n There's far too many of you to die.\n\n30:14.440 --> 30:16.840\n there's some just very subtle backing vocals\n\n30:29.880 --> 30:30.600\n this one hurts\n\n30:33.400 --> 30:35.160\n father father we don't need to escalate\n\n30:35.160 --> 30:45.720\n i wonder who the father he's talking about is\n\n30:46.920 --> 30:52.040\n oh that's interesting i mean i have so for people who don't know his his own father ended up\n\n30:53.240 --> 30:59.880\n uh killing marvin gay yeah i mean that one is really pain i mean for a lot of people your\n\n30:59.880 --> 31:03.880\n relationship with your father your mother i mean there's different dynamics but there's\n\n31:03.880 --> 31:07.960\n it's almost like part of life is resolving some kind of complex puzzle you have\n\n31:08.600 --> 31:12.600\n or the people you love the people close to you or the people who are not there all those kinds\n\n31:12.600 --> 31:18.600\n of things that's so much pain in that we don't need to escalate father father i never thought\n\n31:18.600 --> 31:24.760\n if it's i always thought it's his father directly yeah i don't get that it could be but i don't i\n\n31:24.760 --> 31:36.120\n feel like it's a more um masculine spirituality like a father figure or just broadly some kind\n\n31:36.120 --> 31:43.160\n of spirituality could be like god father god mother god you know like could be i don't know\n\n31:43.880 --> 31:51.080\n but there's there's so much it's like both hope and melancholy you seeing war is not the answer\n\n31:51.080 --> 31:56.200\n it's like you you don't tell your father war is not your your blood father war is not the answer\n\n31:56.200 --> 32:01.240\n it's strange conversation it's a bigger conversation they're not personal don't you\n\n32:01.240 --> 32:10.360\n think it feels like war if one is personal what's the difference between is the war is personal too\n\n32:10.920 --> 32:17.800\n it's only leaders think about war in a geopolitical sense yeah when people that fight wars you lose\n\n32:17.800 --> 32:22.760\n your brothers you lose i mean you death is just right there so it might feel just like that but\n\n32:22.760 --> 32:28.520\n yeah there is a dance between like the personal and like talking to the entirety of the society\n\n32:28.520 --> 32:37.640\n it's like john lennon imagine like also a song where is that is that a hopeful is that cynical\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:46.920\n is it like melancholy like heartbroken like you you hope you wish things would be a certain way\n\n32:46.920 --> 32:52.120\n and they're not yeah i don't know i don't know john lennon is giving up on the world in imagine\n\n32:52.680 --> 32:56.600\n yeah i don't know you know it's a it's an interesting question there's another uh\n\n32:56.600 --> 33:04.120\n john lennon lyric um in let me think of what it is take me a second\n\n33:08.840 --> 33:13.960\n and different songs keep coming into my head the one that i'm looking and you keep pressing next\n\n33:13.960 --> 33:28.040\n um across the universe um nothing's going to change my world and when i hear that\n\n33:29.560 --> 33:34.680\n i hear it as hopeless but i don't think i don't believe that that's\n\n33:36.200 --> 33:40.360\n well it may be how he meant it but i don't think that's how it's normally taken\n\n33:40.360 --> 33:46.280\n and it's also the taker is important i'm generally optimistic and hopeful so i i always like look for\n\n33:46.280 --> 33:52.840\n the hope and the actually the harshest love uh heartbreak songs are always somehow hopeful to me\n\n33:52.840 --> 34:02.760\n that's a love song uh to me like a song about losing love is is a song about the great capacity\n\n34:02.760 --> 34:07.880\n for love in the human heart that's what i hear so to me losing love is exciting because it's\n\n34:07.880 --> 34:12.840\n like that means you really cared that means you felt something you feel something you can sit in\n\n34:12.840 --> 34:20.680\n that pain and that pain is a reminder what it means to be human when you're that um what is it uh\n\n34:20.680 --> 34:25.320\n we're just listening uh the only man who could have reached me was the son of a preacher man\n\n34:25.320 --> 34:30.600\n so see um it's like that early love or something or partially sexual or whatever that's not as\n\n34:30.600 --> 34:36.440\n interesting to me it's fun it's great but it's not as interesting to me as it is to me\n\n34:36.440 --> 34:41.240\n it's fun it's great but it's that heartbreak that's the reminder that it can go deep\n\n34:41.240 --> 34:47.560\n although that's a damn good song have you ever heard the uh detroit mix of the marvin gay album\n\n34:48.120 --> 34:57.000\n no call it up how by far better mind blowing i just heard it recently blew my mind\n\n34:57.000 --> 35:04.840\n oh wow reverb distant\n\n35:04.840 --> 35:06.840\n interesting\n\n35:06.840 --> 35:08.840\n there's\n\n35:08.840 --> 35:16.840\n there's far too many of you\n\n35:16.840 --> 35:18.840\n it feels like it's all around the room more\n\n35:18.840 --> 35:36.840\n to bring some loving here today\n\n35:36.840 --> 35:38.840\n more voices more voices\n\n35:38.840 --> 35:52.840\n he's layering his own vocals\n\n35:52.840 --> 36:08.840\n just like there's multiple people singing\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:22.840\n don't punish me with brutality talk to me so you can see oh what's going on that's beautiful yeah\n\n36:22.840 --> 36:27.480\n seems to have more energy if you if you listen to the whole album even even though you just said\n\n36:27.480 --> 36:33.000\n you don't listen albums anymore the detroit mix of the whole album changes the album a lot\n\n36:33.000 --> 36:39.160\n i mean that that felt uh so that's the opposite of a cappella i would say yes because it's saying\n\n36:39.160 --> 36:46.600\n it's it's um there's layers there's um and that maybe i don't know if you remember but\n\n36:47.800 --> 36:53.720\n if memory serves me uh correct here he produces this own album here marvin gay was the producer\n\n36:53.720 --> 36:59.080\n on this i believe i believe so and this one sounds more like it's a get together and the\n\n36:59.080 --> 37:04.280\n whole album sounds more like a get together where it's a group of people in a room playing music\n\n37:04.280 --> 37:11.480\n together whereas the album version sounds more like an out like a recording this sounds less\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:16.360\n like a recording and a little more like a party now you had a series of conversations with paul\n\n37:16.360 --> 37:22.120\n mccartney which is amazing that people should should watch but is is there this is continuing\n\n37:22.120 --> 37:29.240\n our therapy session is there a case to be made that uh what's going on is number one album above\n\n37:29.240 --> 37:36.920\n the beatles uh white album or abbey road above pet sounds can you still manage case there's\n\n37:36.920 --> 37:43.000\n there's always a case i mean there's always a case every there's no uh in reality in art there is no\n\n37:43.000 --> 37:50.680\n um there's no metric that makes sense so um you could put numbers on things but it's like\n\n37:50.680 --> 37:58.280\n is this apple better than this peach like it's not really a fair comparison but if you just had\n\n37:58.280 --> 38:04.440\n to keep one to represent the human species that's the way i think to the aliens so i think it's a\n\n38:04.440 --> 38:09.320\n very personal decision i don't i think you can make you can make your choice to represent the\n\n38:09.320 --> 38:14.440\n human species and i'll make mine you know well i would pick the beatles over the beach boys so\n\n38:14.440 --> 38:19.320\n that's my if i became dictator of the world i was talking to the aliens but i do think that\n\n38:19.320 --> 38:24.360\n aliens but i don't know the full historical context to the impact of the music i don't\n\n38:24.360 --> 38:30.200\n know if that's something to consider like this kind of thought experiment of imagine what it was\n\n38:30.200 --> 38:37.720\n like back then to create to go into the studio to do such interesting work in the studio\n\n38:39.240 --> 38:45.000\n as opposed to like listening to just as a pop song almost from because i've never been able\n\n38:45.000 --> 38:54.200\n to understand uh beach boys god only knows the song god only knows god only knows but all of\n\n38:54.200 --> 39:03.080\n it the album the pet sounds just in my room was uh in my room that's all um is that what's your\n\n39:03.080 --> 39:09.880\n favorite on the album that sounds album that sounds um the opening track do you mind if i\n\n39:09.880 --> 39:21.480\n play it please it's it's it's too fun that's part of their trip though the you uh you open\n\n39:21.480 --> 39:32.840\n the heart with the fun it's possible original mono and stereo mix versions i don't know what's\n\n39:32.840 --> 39:46.680\n the opening song wouldn't it be nice yeah that's the song\n\n40:14.040 --> 40:18.120\n we could say good night and stay together wouldn't that be nice wouldn't it be nice\n\n40:18.120 --> 40:23.240\n wake up together but we're not there's heartbreak in this one too\n\n40:24.520 --> 40:30.920\n still to me like george harris like um uh is that the way that album while my guitar gently weeps\n\n40:30.920 --> 40:38.440\n i mean that um with the beatles it's so hard to depending on the day i'll i'll say a very different\n\n40:38.440 --> 40:43.720\n song that's my favorite song but i often return to while my guitar gently weeps is my favorite song\n\n40:43.720 --> 40:48.680\n spectacular spectacular anything george harrison honestly something something in the way she moves\n\n40:51.160 --> 40:55.800\n the bet i what would you classify that there's like several beatle songs categories of beatles\n\n40:55.800 --> 41:01.000\n categories of beatles songs so that's like the melancholy love songs or ballads or something like\n\n41:01.000 --> 41:10.280\n that um yesterday let it be what's do you have favorites so from your like how have you changed\n\n41:10.280 --> 41:17.320\n as a man as a human being as a musician and music producer ever having done that lengthy interaction\n\n41:17.320 --> 41:27.880\n with with mccartney hmm anytime you're around someone who's such a hero and you spend time\n\n41:27.880 --> 41:33.160\n with them and they're a human being it helps put perspective on everything you know that they're\n\n41:33.160 --> 41:39.400\n just human that well obviously i mean every everyone's just human and um but i remember\n\n41:39.400 --> 41:44.680\n the first time i got to see paul mccartney play live it was in a stadium of 70 000 people\n\n41:44.680 --> 41:51.320\n and he started playing and i started crying and i couldn't believe i was in even with 70 000 people\n\n41:51.320 --> 41:57.160\n i couldn't believe i that this man walks the earth and that i'm in the same place as him\n\n41:57.720 --> 42:03.240\n and he's the person who wrote that and played that and now he's here playing it for us\n\n42:03.240 --> 42:13.960\n it's mind blowing that's the voice that's the it's overwhelming is it inspiring or is it um\n\n42:15.080 --> 42:21.240\n like because sometimes when you have and i've gotten a chance to me i mean i love people in\n\n42:21.240 --> 42:26.360\n general like every every person is fascinating to me but yeah when you've been a fan for a long time\n\n42:26.360 --> 42:35.960\n and you meet a person uh sort of uh i'll just remove present company is you um it's like oh\n\n42:35.960 --> 42:42.360\n they're just human so there's both it's both inspiring that just a simple human can achieve\n\n42:42.360 --> 42:50.760\n such beautiful things but it's also like almost wishing there were gods moving in around us it's\n\n42:50.760 --> 42:58.680\n it's somehow peaceful this is it's more uh comforting to know that there's you know uh\n\n42:58.680 --> 43:04.440\n there's bigger fish i'm just a small fish and then there's bigger fish and it will take care\n\n43:04.440 --> 43:10.040\n of the ocean for us i think we're all capable of being big fish i don't think that there are\n\n43:10.040 --> 43:17.320\n special people i don't think it it's like that i i would make a case so the variety\n\n43:17.320 --> 43:24.520\n of artists that you worked with and brought the best out of it does seem the year out of this\n\n43:24.520 --> 43:35.320\n world so do you think you would know like if you're the same kind of species maybe you're\n\n43:35.320 --> 43:41.080\n just a meat vehicle and you're channeling ideas from somewhere else i feel like i'm channeling\n\n43:41.080 --> 43:46.520\n ideas from somewhere else 100 but i think have you asked questions about where from i believe\n\n43:46.520 --> 43:57.160\n we i believe we all are though you know i believe we are um we're vehicles for information that when\n\n43:57.160 --> 44:01.560\n it's ready to come through it comes through and the people who have good antennas pick up the\n\n44:01.560 --> 44:08.120\n signal but um if i'm sure you've had an experience in your life where you've had an idea for something\n\n44:08.120 --> 44:13.320\n and you've not acted on it and eventually someone else does it and it's not because they're doing\n\n44:13.320 --> 44:17.080\n and it's not because they're doing it because you had the idea and they stole your idea it's because\n\n44:17.880 --> 44:22.840\n the time has come for that idea and if you don't do it someone else is going to it's\n\n44:22.840 --> 44:28.600\n being broadcast by whatever the source whatever the source is uh yeah i tend to\n\n44:30.440 --> 44:35.160\n i tend to see humans as not quite special in that way yeah it's it's different kinds of antennas\n\n44:35.160 --> 44:43.800\n walking around listening to ideas and ideas that are i like the the notion of uh richard dawkins of memes\n\n44:43.800 --> 44:48.760\n or it's kind of the ideas of the organisms and they're just using our brains to multiply to\n\n44:49.480 --> 44:55.160\n to select to compete to to evolve and humans we really want to hold on to the\n\n44:55.160 --> 45:00.760\n specialness of our body of our mind but it's it's really the ideas so for a group when was born\n\n45:00.760 --> 45:09.320\n two centuries ago you wouldn't be a music producer you'd be or i mean maybe but you have an antenna\n\n45:10.440 --> 45:16.280\n and if no signal is coming in uh or you'd be hearing a potentially a different signal\n\n45:17.960 --> 45:24.200\n is there um i think we all have our own antenna for whatever it is that we you know maybe not\n\n45:24.200 --> 45:31.080\n everyone has tuned into their antenna to see what it is that their strength and bringing through is\n\n45:31.080 --> 45:35.960\n i'm lucky in that it found me because i didn't know that it was a i didn't even know this was a job\n\n45:36.920 --> 45:44.680\n i sometimes wonder i mean a lot of young people a lot of people wonder like what's the purpose\n\n45:44.680 --> 45:56.280\n and the the specs of my antenna what am i put on this earth to do like if um you know i i\n\n45:56.280 --> 46:02.600\n can live a thousand lives there's so many trajectories and imagine the greatest possible\n\n46:02.600 --> 46:09.080\n trajectory that reveals the the most beautiful thing i can possibly create in this world live\n\n46:09.080 --> 46:15.800\n the most beautiful way uh what is that i feel like that's a good exercise to think about\n\n46:17.080 --> 46:23.400\n um because it's also liberating to think that you can do anything i mean that\n\n46:24.200 --> 46:30.760\n um more and more i suppose that's kind of life it's like society is pushing conformity on you\n\n46:30.760 --> 46:36.120\n you know i thought i i had my own flavor of conformity i thought i'm supposed to be following\n\n46:36.120 --> 46:42.280\n and then early on i would say like in the late 20s you realize wait a minute you don't have to\n\n46:42.280 --> 46:47.320\n tell you don't have to do what teachers tell you to do what parents tell you to do what\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:55.400\n society tells you do you can like um i would never wear a suit if i listened to like my colleagues\n\n46:55.400 --> 47:04.440\n and community who think a suit is like the symbol of uh what is it a symbol of conformity actually\n\n47:04.440 --> 47:09.880\n which is hilarious but uh it's actually a kind of rebellion and everything else like of that nature\n\n47:09.880 --> 47:17.480\n doing doing these silly podcasts like um i have a question i have to ask sure because you brought\n\n47:17.480 --> 47:26.520\n up the suit yeah uh do you wear the suit is this your daily uniform outside of podcasting so uh for\n\n47:26.520 --> 47:33.640\n the longest time it was some kind of suit and then recently i mean coinciding with going to texas\n\n47:33.640 --> 47:41.320\n there's a i'm such a loner i'm an introvert and there's a bit of a hiding from the world when i\n\n47:42.040 --> 47:51.480\n wear other stuff i really want to um to not make fame recognition\n\n47:53.080 --> 48:01.400\n money all those things a motivation at all and the world kind of wants you to make those motivations\n\n48:01.400 --> 48:06.840\n not not the world but i would say maybe the western world and maybe america maybe a capitalist system\n\n48:06.840 --> 48:16.600\n does but that's a choice to buy into that or not right it takes a brave person a person of character\n\n48:16.600 --> 48:22.760\n to not buy in and i'm i'm like a like a baby deer trying to find his legs you don't have to\n\n48:23.320 --> 48:28.120\n buy in because i love people and i think i'm kind of an idiot and so when other people\n\n48:28.120 --> 48:35.800\n say do this and do that it uh there's a there is a pressure there it's actually very difficult to\n\n48:36.600 --> 48:43.240\n not listen necessarily to the advice of others and yet keep yourself fragile and open to the world\n\n48:44.440 --> 48:50.600\n it's easy to be like i'm always right you know just kind of sticking a ground but if you want\n\n48:50.600 --> 48:55.640\n to be like vulnerable if you want to connect with people and just wear your heart on your sleeve\n\n48:55.640 --> 49:01.800\n then you're going to listen to them i mean that's the double edged sword of it and uh but then again\n\n49:01.800 --> 49:08.600\n that pain like if you don't let it destroy you can grow grow from that has fame affected you at all\n\n49:08.600 --> 49:14.680\n did you unplug from the system at some point same i've always been sort of removed i don't\n\n49:14.680 --> 49:22.920\n feel like i'm part of any system do you feel famous um i'm aware that when i go out people\n\n49:22.920 --> 49:29.720\n will you know say nice things to me which is great but that's about it that's about as far as\n\n49:29.720 --> 49:34.040\n but it doesn't affect your art about your creativity or your thoughts like when you're\n\n49:34.040 --> 49:42.600\n sitting alone and thinking about the world it can't it's a destructive force the the thing\n\n49:43.240 --> 49:49.400\n the reason that you're who you are and the reason that you're finding the success you're finding\n\n49:49.400 --> 49:54.280\n is because you've been true to yourself to get to that stage so to start changing that\n\n49:55.240 --> 49:59.960\n to conform to either conform to someone else's idea what you should be doing\n\n50:01.000 --> 50:06.840\n it just seems like uh it doesn't make sense do you have a sense of who you are because i don't\n\n50:06.840 --> 50:13.640\n necessarily have a i don't know i i know that i really like making good things and i know that i'm\n\n50:13.640 --> 50:22.280\n um crazy about it in that um it's like an obsession and i want things to be as good as\n\n50:22.280 --> 50:28.360\n they could be whatever it is and if i'm if i finish a music project and i have a window of\n\n50:28.360 --> 50:33.640\n time where i'm not working on music i might be moving the furniture around in the house you know\n\n50:33.640 --> 50:41.640\n i'm always looking for a prod a creative outlet to find a way to make something better or there\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:46.280\n was a period of time where i was in a weird corporate situation that was uh\n\n50:49.480 --> 50:57.240\n that didn't allow me to flourish and i turned i focused the creativity and on myself and i\n\n50:57.240 --> 51:01.720\n lost a bunch of weight and changed my life and so that was the kind of art like the you've gone\n\n51:01.720 --> 51:06.680\n through a whole process of losing weight getting in shape getting healthy that was a kind of creative\n\n51:06.680 --> 51:12.840\n act it certainly was it wasn't an intentional creative act but i had a lot of energy and i just\n\n51:13.800 --> 51:20.680\n a series of events happened i read a book at the time that was my heaviest i weighed about 318\n\n51:20.680 --> 51:25.640\n pounds yeah and i'd never been i'd been sedentary my whole life basically laying on a couch working\n\n51:25.640 --> 51:32.920\n on music so i've never been physically active in my life and i read a book about a guy named stew\n\n51:32.920 --> 51:38.920\n middleman a runner who ran a thousand miles in 11 days and i thought wow i you know get out of\n\n51:38.920 --> 51:45.160\n breath walking to the corner and another human being can run a thousand miles in 11 days i feel\n\n51:45.160 --> 51:50.920\n like i have bad information you know i'm doing clearly i'm doing something wrong and um and i\n\n51:50.920 --> 51:56.680\n reached out to a person that stew mentioned in the book phil maffatone who's a legend i i really\n\n51:56.680 --> 52:03.240\n appreciate him as well he's math 180 method too he's such an interesting i think he focuses on\n\n52:03.240 --> 52:10.920\n heart rate uh training and he was the first person to talk about um essentially a\n\n52:12.760 --> 52:22.120\n low carbs paleo yeah keto diet 40 40 years ago for a person who's going to be healthy who can\n\n52:22.120 --> 52:29.480\n exercise and actually perform at an early level he's the first person when i um you know talked\n\n52:29.480 --> 52:35.080\n about heart rate training him and other endurance athletes he influenced he gave me permission to\n\n52:35.080 --> 52:41.640\n like run slower yeah it's the first time i realized oh i can run long distances if i just\n\n52:41.640 --> 52:48.520\n run slower and then take that seriously and i actually fell in love with running very much so\n\n52:48.520 --> 52:54.360\n because for me everyone's different but for me the love of running happens in the longer distances\n\n52:54.360 --> 52:59.960\n yeah did you read born to run great book amazing book there is something special about running\n\n53:01.080 --> 53:06.520\n and everybody has their own their own journey with it and even ultra marathon running those\n\n53:06.520 --> 53:16.200\n kinds of things it's a it is like many journeys one that can pull you in like you won't be the\n\n53:16.200 --> 53:21.560\n same person after and i i try to be deliberate about making deliberate about making choices\n\n53:23.000 --> 53:29.000\n after which you'll not be the same person and so i'm nervous about like the ultra marathon running\n\n53:29.000 --> 53:39.880\n world i have to talk to you about johnny cash i mean when people ask me what my\n\n53:39.880 --> 53:47.400\n favorite musical thing is of all time i'm\n\n53:51.400 --> 53:55.080\n you know it's a very difficult question to answer of course but i'm pretty quick\n\n53:55.720 --> 54:03.960\n if i'm not allowed to pick anything by tom ways i'm pretty quick to say hurt by johnny cash\n\n54:03.960 --> 54:08.120\n the performance the whatever you call it whatever the heck that is because that's\n\n54:08.120 --> 54:17.000\n not just a song covered by an artist that's a human being at the end of their life\n\n54:18.840 --> 54:26.920\n that the rawness of that the i mean just the there's also a music video which for a lot of\n\n54:26.920 --> 54:36.600\n people adds a lot to it uh for me just the music alone is i mean the guitar every choice on that\n\n54:36.600 --> 54:41.800\n see the the few things i've heard about it it seemed like almost accidental i mean like little\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:50.280\n subtle choices here and there can you maybe comment on that um to to the degree i i think\n\n54:50.280 --> 54:56.440\n you had a huge role in sort of bringing johnny cash back from from a different part of his life\n\n54:56.440 --> 55:01.560\n it's like bringing something out that wasn't there before and it was it was it was incredible\n\n55:01.560 --> 55:08.440\n it was a celebration of a really special musician and a totally new kind of celebration now hurt is\n\n55:08.440 --> 55:13.720\n just one of the songs that's that's a that's an amazing celebration of johnny cash but hurt is\n\n55:13.720 --> 55:21.960\n like at the at the at the peak of that so what was that like putting that song together okay maybe\n\n55:21.960 --> 55:27.240\n maybe uh it might be nice to listen to it because i freaking love that song and as a guitarist\n\n55:27.240 --> 55:38.440\n i just the simplicity of it uh it seems like every choice contributes to the greatness of the song\n\n55:48.440 --> 55:51.080\n simple it's crisp but it's dark too\n\n55:51.080 --> 55:57.480\n i hurt myself today it's one of the greatest opening lines of any song\n\n56:01.640 --> 56:06.520\n to see if i still feel yeah i'm talking about the lyrics i don't even mean the performance the words\n\n56:15.480 --> 56:20.040\n but those words out of Trent Reznor are not the same they have a different meaning\n\n56:20.040 --> 56:23.000\n coming out of johnny cash's mouth\n\n56:23.000 --> 56:31.560\n try to kill it all away but i remember everything\n\n56:31.560 --> 56:42.200\n what have i become what have i become my sweetest friend\n\n56:42.200 --> 57:01.160\n written probably for a young man i think he was 20 when he wrote it\n\n57:01.160 --> 57:22.680\n the way the guitarist played the choice of instrument the layers there\n\n57:22.680 --> 57:33.240\n the uh the freedom to give him to use the voice that's um fading it's not fading it's changing\n\n57:34.040 --> 57:42.040\n maybe he's losing some aspects of his voice and it's it's almost like shaking a little bit\n\n57:42.920 --> 57:45.640\n and it's a little bit out of tune in parts\n\n57:45.640 --> 57:54.360\n uh how much of that was deliberate how much was like how do you give johnny castor freedom to\n\n57:54.360 --> 58:01.480\n to do that how do you find that together is there any insights you can give i think it's a it's a\n\n58:01.480 --> 58:10.440\n case almost of like the right pairing the right role with the right actor you could say the the\n\n58:10.440 --> 58:16.120\n song lyrics that the reason we chose the song was because the lyrics purely about the lyrics\n\n58:17.160 --> 58:21.240\n and at that point in time both johnny and i would send each other songs of possible\n\n58:21.240 --> 58:29.080\n ideas to record and um that was one that i sent him and he didn't respond to initially i sent i\n\n58:29.080 --> 58:34.120\n would send him see at that time we would burn cds and i would send him like cd of 20 songs or 25\n\n58:34.120 --> 58:38.520\n songs and then and he would send them to me he burned a cd for johnny cash and you sent him\n\n58:38.520 --> 58:44.920\n uh of different songs of like songs to consider recording yeah um and we would send these back\n\n58:44.920 --> 58:51.800\n and forth and then that i had hurt on one of the ones that i sent him and he didn't respond and\n\n58:51.800 --> 58:58.680\n usually if he didn't respond we didn't go back to it you know and that one i remember i sent it\n\n58:58.680 --> 59:05.880\n again and i put it first on the next on the next cd and um and when when we spoke about when he\n\n59:05.880 --> 59:10.440\n listened to cd again he didn't respond i said check out that first song and i really feel like that one\n\n59:10.440 --> 59:15.800\n could be good what did you see in that song it's the lyrics it's the lyrics because i feel like\n\n59:15.800 --> 59:25.400\n nobody there's very few people in the world that would see these lyrics in johnny cash's mouth and\n\n59:25.400 --> 59:32.040\n think this is a good idea including for president yeah i know that trant was trant had trepidations\n\n59:32.040 --> 59:38.280\n in the evening um but if you listen to the words if you forget the music and if you get what if\n\n59:38.280 --> 59:44.680\n you forget what nine ish nail sounds like and you just read it like a poem and then you imagine\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:53.960\n a 70 year old man reading these lyrics it'll be it'll be profound it's profound so that was the\n\n59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.760\n based on lyrics that started the journey and then at this point in time johnny was not in great\n\n1:00:00.760 --> 1:00:08.200\n health and uh sometimes i would go to nashville and record with him at his house sometimes he\n\n1:00:08.200 --> 1:00:14.600\n would come to california but he was coming to california less regularly and because there was\n\n1:00:14.600 --> 1:00:21.080\n there were so many songs we wanted to try he would start sometimes recording just a straight\n\n1:00:21.080 --> 1:00:27.160\n acoustic version like you'd have someone play guitar he would sing and they would send those\n\n1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:33.080\n to me and we would discuss like is this one to build on um and that was when we said i don't\n\n1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:36.440\n want to record this one until we're together i feel like we should do this one together\n\n1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:41.640\n so on the next trip to california we recorded it at my at my old house\n\n1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:45.820\n and\n\n1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.240\n i mean all the songs we recorded felt special so i can't say this one felt special\n\n1:00:55.240 --> 1:01:02.440\n but lyrically it just it's more the the lyrics have such a profound\n\n1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:12.760\n sense of regret what have i become yeah and to hear when you're 20 years old talking about regret\n\n1:01:13.800 --> 1:01:17.480\n yeah it's heartbreaking but it's heartbreaking in a different way because you have your whole\n\n1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:23.160\n life to figure it out when you're looking back over your life at the end of your life with regret\n\n1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:30.840\n it's brutal yeah it's brutal so that was the initial spark of doing it and then we when we\n\n1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:41.240\n recorded it i believe it was um two guitar players if i remember correctly maybe even three um smoky\n\n1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:50.040\n hormel matt sweeney and mike campbell i believe and ben montench was playing the piano in my living\n\n1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:59.000\n room as we were doing it and we cut the basic track and with johnny singing and then johnny\n\n1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.840\n probably sang over that basic track a few more times and then we comped his vocal and then\n\n1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:13.240\n built up the drama and you didn't get to the part but at the end of the song it gets very loud the\n\n1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:19.960\n music gets very loud it's subtle because it's not anything that takes your ear and the vocal is so\n\n1:02:20.440 --> 1:02:23.880\n powerful that you don't really think about what's going on but it's building the whole time it's\n\n1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:33.880\n building and it even gets distorted at the end it gets really uh like over overpowering and that's\n\n1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:54.680\n part of the emotion of it you know it's uh i hear almost anger and frustration\n\n1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:18.680\n and it just rings out the clean vocal i mean it's so simple so incredible and it's interesting to\n\n1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:29.080\n have a young man's lyrics in in an old johnny cash voice and heart and mind i had um are you\n\n1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:35.640\n a fan of tom waits of course uh tom waits when he was younger had his this is a song called martha\n\n1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:40.280\n but there's a bunch of songs he's written when he was young it's like how does a young man\n\n1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:51.000\n have that like melancholy wisdom the song martha is about uh an older man calling a woman he used\n\n1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:56.440\n to love that she's now married and he's married and they're having that conversation they haven't\n\n1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:02.120\n spoken for 30 years and they realize that there's still love there and it could have been a different\n\n1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:07.960\n life a different world where they could have been together and here's like a 23 year old tom waits\n\n1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:14.760\n writing so beautifully about something that's very uh i've had a lot of people like tell me how\n\n1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:22.280\n real that uh as an older person looking back at that love that you had and realizing it wasn't\n\n1:04:22.280 --> 1:04:28.120\n it was really it's still there inklings of that love are still there i think there's a um\n\n1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:35.560\n when a young person writes a sad song\n\n1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:42.040\n they almost seem more willing to go to a more hopeless place\n\n1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:50.040\n because they have they have a so much time ahead and older artists tend to want to look at the\n\n1:04:50.040 --> 1:04:55.080\n bright side of things which which also i think comes from the wisdom of aging it's it's a more\n\n1:04:55.080 --> 1:05:02.200\n realistic position so it's not uncommon for younger people to write i think even in the\n\n1:05:02.200 --> 1:05:11.400\n beatles you'll see like they're very heavy lyrics um middle to late era beatles which is still you\n\n1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:17.080\n know they're in their 20s you know early 20s i guess wow that's hard to think about so much\n\n1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:24.040\n accomplished unbelievable and they they went through the full journey from fun to darkness\n\n1:05:25.560 --> 1:05:31.880\n in the span of a few years uh you mentioned lyrics um so you've obviously produced\n\n1:05:33.560 --> 1:05:38.200\n albums with incredible lyrics i think you've mentioned the interesting characteristics of\n\n1:05:38.200 --> 1:05:48.280\n hip hop of rap is that you're writing poetry to rhythm versus writing poetry to melody so\n\n1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:53.880\n that's like one way to think about it and i'm a fan i mean tom waits let it go i'm a fan of\n\n1:05:53.880 --> 1:06:02.760\n poetry period is there something um about highlighting the poetry of it the power of\n\n1:06:02.760 --> 1:06:10.600\n words as you did with with heart if uh like if i have to play it again it's one uh a tom waits song\n\n1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:17.080\n that's like less than a minute long that i always go back to it's one i really love and\n\n1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:35.080\n has just a few lines it's called i want you and all it is is him saying i want you\n\n1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:47.640\n i want you this is a 22 year old Tom Waits\n\n1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:50.600\n all i want is you\n\n1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:57.960\n give you stars above\n\n1:06:57.960 --> 1:07:02.680\n the sun on the brightest day\n\n1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:06.760\n giving you all my love\n\n1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:15.400\n if only you would see that i want you you you\n\n1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:29.560\n you all i want is you you you and then he hums for 20 more seconds beautiful so so\n\n1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:34.840\n simple man that young man like low and but for people who don't know tom waits you should\n\n1:07:34.840 --> 1:07:39.000\n definitely listen to him and his voice sounds very different now and it's interesting to see\n\n1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:47.400\n the evolution of a human voice the the artist over time because that's a young like boy like voice\n\n1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:55.080\n hopeful less clever less witty more simple that simplicity is there and he's not i mean that\n\n1:07:55.080 --> 1:08:05.240\n takes guts to be so simple i would say lyrically and uh musically is there um sort of laying that\n\n1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:14.360\n out on the table is there ways to that you like to highlight the voice the lyrics or there's no one\n\n1:08:15.800 --> 1:08:22.760\n rule so do you what is the thing that makes music special is it the rhythm the melody the\n\n1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:29.480\n uh or is ultimately the lyrics are always there or the idea you just asked me five different\n\n1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:39.880\n questions i don't care i'll just get that it's not about you you don't want the answers i'll listen\n\n1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:49.480\n uh i look forward to your comments the internet okay uh you have the greatest producer of all\n\n1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:56.280\n time in front of you and you can't shut the hell up that's right friends uh is but you do value\n\n1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:02.680\n lyrics is there a way to celebrate lyrics i value lyrics if the lyrics are important i'm not a lyric\n\n1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:09.880\n person i'm very much uh whatever the thing that makes the thing good is the thing that i'm drawn\n\n1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:19.000\n to for me um for a long time lyrics meant very little i would say from me really yes yes from\n\n1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:24.280\n the earliest days for your right to party beastie boys yeah it was it was fun i thought they were\n\n1:09:24.280 --> 1:09:31.000\n good lyrics but it wasn't what was important i mean it was in a in a almost a novelty way\n\n1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:39.880\n not in a serious way early in my career i was much more focused on the rhythm first the rhythm\n\n1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:47.160\n and i would if the lyrics weren't good enough i would be aware of it but it wasn't the driving\n\n1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:52.440\n force for me and eventually over time then melody became an important piece which it\n\n1:09:52.440 --> 1:10:00.040\n wasn't in the beginning and then uh lyrics became more important over time but it's always been a\n\n1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:08.440\n always changing what what draws me in and one of the things i found as it relates to lyrics that\n\n1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:18.360\n that can give a lyric a different power has to do with rhythm where if there's no drum\n\n1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:22.040\n um the lyrics tend to mean more\n\n1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:27.400\n so earlier what you were saying about if it was just acapella\n\n1:10:28.680 --> 1:10:32.440\n you felt you felt marvin gay in a different way hearing the acapella\n\n1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:49.720\n can you comment on i mean in terms of one of the greatest albums ever why does it sound so raw\n\n1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:56.760\n her voice she's just a great singer but this is that you're not doing anything else you're doing\n\n1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:02.840\n the uh there's there's there's strumming and then there's just a single beat\n\n1:11:05.960 --> 1:11:14.040\n and then it builds\n\n1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:16.360\n starting in my heart\n\n1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:29.320\n this gets simpler but it feels like it's a giant orchestra\n\n1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:38.040\n we almost had it all the scars of your love they leave me breathless i can't help feeling\n\n1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:50.520\n there's backing vocals\n\n1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:54.360\n the anger i love it\n\n1:11:54.360 --> 1:12:07.880\n i just there's something about uh such a powerful voice and the instruments not getting in the way\n\n1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:16.040\n i mean the same with the with hurt and johnny cash it is there um why does it sound so\n\n1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:23.560\n like raw it's the same as hurt there's a it feels like you're in the room with them it feels like\n\n1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:30.680\n they're not even singing they're like uh they're literally freshly mad and angry i think those are\n\n1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:35.400\n the things that make great singers sound like great singers it's not it's not anything that\n\n1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:41.240\n that's happening in the studio i mean we're i would say the only thing that us in the studio\n\n1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:49.800\n can do is kind of get out of the way and not not ruin it you know it's like that's that's\n\n1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:58.040\n what comes through of these these people i should also before i forget there is a lot of song choices\n\n1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:03.560\n on that cd i would love to see the full options on the cd that you sent to johnny cash that i love\n\n1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:10.440\n so solitary man is one of my favorite choices made there uh is it is that a neil damon song\n\n1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:16.760\n it's funny you talk about them as songs because i tend to i tend to listen more to albums than\n\n1:13:16.760 --> 1:13:21.720\n songs so if you really you're that's what you're doing your head you're pulling up the album\n\n1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:27.560\n essentially no i'm like i'm going to that song but i don't know i've never listened to that song\n\n1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:31.080\n but i know that when that when that song comes up in the sequence of the album\n\n1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:46.280\n um it has a really powerful effect in me let's see what it does if you just started\n\n1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:59.480\n if you could read my so interesting wow\n\n1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:12.600\n i could tell just like an old time movie about a ghost from a wishing well in a castle dark\n\n1:14:13.960 --> 1:14:23.640\n or a fortress strong with chains around my feet you know that ghost is me\n\n1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:34.280\n and i will never be set free as long as there's a ghost that you can see\n\n1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:44.120\n that's beautiful such a beautiful choice beautiful melody such a beautiful melody\n\n1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:54.600\n and haunting words sung so simply i i have to um i mean so uh i was born in the soviet union\n\n1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:06.360\n when when you when you're growing up uh there's a few bands that kind of i mean they're probably\n\n1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:14.600\n forbidden still but they seep in and you get like uh bootlegged and and they somehow take over the\n\n1:15:14.600 --> 1:15:21.720\n culture of the young of the young folk such as myself so uh on the metal side it was metallica\n\n1:15:21.720 --> 1:15:31.000\n and iron maiden and uh on the i don't know what you call them but beastie boys i remember hearing\n\n1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:37.960\n uh fight for your right and it was just like for some reason that stuck as it did for a lot of\n\n1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:44.680\n people in russia it's like wow america is when you get to say fuck you to the man the rebellion the\n\n1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:51.720\n freedom um i probably heard it uh a few years after it was released because it kind of it\n\n1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:56.200\n dissipates to the culture you get the bootlegged i mean it's hard to get your hands on but i just\n\n1:15:56.200 --> 1:16:01.560\n remember me i i wanted to kind of bring that up because it was such a personally important song\n\n1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:08.120\n to me and yet probably you didn't even think of that you probably thought of it as its role in\n\n1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:15.880\n the culture here in the united states like in terms of musically but i was you know 20 21 years old\n\n1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:20.040\n and we just well you were that kid too right we're just making fun songs for our friends there was\n\n1:16:20.040 --> 1:16:26.680\n no there was no uh expectation that's just a fun song yeah no one thought we never imagined anybody\n\n1:16:26.680 --> 1:16:37.560\n would like any of it one of the greatest albums ever yeah i have to it's i love this so much i\n\n1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:51.240\n just remember this is america i didn't even know i didn't even understand the lyrics to be honest\n\n1:16:51.240 --> 1:17:04.920\n and the lyrics are ridiculous\n\n1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:34.120\n so hearing that and hearing metallica master puppets i was like i knew i'm gonna have to end\n\n1:17:34.120 --> 1:17:42.440\n up in america one day i mean maybe now that i'm more mature or maybe a little bit more mature i\n\n1:17:42.440 --> 1:17:49.720\n realized like that was kind of the longing for freedom it felt like at least at the time if this\n\n1:17:49.720 --> 1:18:00.600\n is allowed that anything is allowed yeah and i think that uh the rebellion of it the uh is i\n\n1:18:00.600 --> 1:18:05.800\n guess it's also fun i just i just loved it is there if you look back to that because you're\n\n1:18:05.800 --> 1:18:13.240\n you're uh uh i mean you were that person not just the producer it feels like yes and no like it was\n\n1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:19.560\n even to us then it was still like satirical you know it wasn't oh absolutely but isn't like music\n\n1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:26.120\n in part like you're dancing in the line is part satirical part serious in in the sense like you're\n\n1:18:26.120 --> 1:18:32.120\n losing yourself in the satire like when you have anytime you go over the top isn't that part of the\n\n1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:39.640\n or is this is it explicitly satirical you make it fun i mean girls there's a lot of\n\n1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:44.600\n ridiculous songs in that album i don't know i just think it's it was definitely to make each\n\n1:18:44.600 --> 1:18:49.800\n other laugh like we were trying to make each other laugh we weren't trying to make a point we're\n\n1:18:49.800 --> 1:18:57.080\n trying to make each other laugh but that person how's that person different than the person today\n\n1:18:57.080 --> 1:19:01.960\n in you the the person that produced that i wouldn't say so different it's like it really is\n\n1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:08.120\n that that um i like things that make me laugh you know i like ridiculous things it's the same person\n\n1:19:08.120 --> 1:19:14.680\n still i think so that is a strange just how many incredible i mean i wouldn't i don't think i would\n\n1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:22.840\n make that today but i understand why we made it when we did it's uh in the vocabulary of of um\n\n1:19:22.840 --> 1:19:28.520\n ridiculous that would make sense to do you know for the right artist today could make something\n\n1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:35.640\n ridiculous and gives you that feeling i mean there's just a sense when you make so many\n\n1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:43.720\n many different albums then you look back at that creation and it can feel like a different person\n\n1:19:43.720 --> 1:19:50.120\n created that but you're making it seem like if you travel back in time or maybe do a memory replay\n\n1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:58.600\n you'll be able to hang out with the with a teenage and the 20s recruitment i think yeah i i don't\n\n1:19:58.600 --> 1:20:06.360\n i don't think i was so different honestly that's hilarious it's funny i ran into someone um recently\n\n1:20:08.200 --> 1:20:13.880\n in costa rica who i hadn't seen in a long time and who i knew from the new york days when\n\n1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:21.160\n those days and um and we spent a couple of hours talking and she said you're exactly\n\n1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:29.480\n the same person that you were then so i have a short you know a recent confirmation that that's\n\n1:20:29.480 --> 1:20:34.440\n the case that's beautiful was it tim ferris asked you about like who's the most successful person\n\n1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:40.200\n you know that's the definition of success i would say it's exactly the same person you haven't lost\n\n1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:46.120\n yourself and or rather you found yourself early on i would say there there are aspects of me that\n\n1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:54.680\n have changed for sure um but i but i can't say that it's that it's necessarily better it's\n\n1:20:54.680 --> 1:21:04.120\n different um at that i would say at that time i was more confident than i am now and i'm very\n\n1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:11.480\n confident now but then i had an unrealistic um confidence and i think now it's a little more\n\n1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:18.120\n um based in reality at that point in time i had never been depressed and then once you go through\n\n1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:25.240\n a depression you well some people i know in my case and when i went through depression afterwards\n\n1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:33.800\n i was a different person than i was before and i and i feel more um grounded now than i did then\n\n1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:40.920\n and i probably relate to the artists who so many of the artists i work with suffer so many artists\n\n1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:45.960\n suffer because that's part of what makes an artist great is their level of sensitivity\n\n1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:53.160\n that this the same thing that makes uh an artist uncomfortable other people don't feel at all\n\n1:21:53.160 --> 1:22:02.600\n people don't feel at all the time you were depressed what was the darkest moments of your\n\n1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:10.600\n life what took you there how did you get out it was triggered by a person making a comment about\n\n1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:17.240\n something to do with work that didn't matter you know it was like uh to anyone else they would\n\n1:22:17.240 --> 1:22:21.320\n hear that and it would just be like okay we'll deal with it next week whatever but for some\n\n1:22:21.320 --> 1:22:28.920\n reason i took it in a way that um i felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me even beyond\n\n1:22:28.920 --> 1:22:36.120\n the rational part of it of understanding you know even after the problem that came up was solved\n\n1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:42.760\n it somehow undermined something in me and made me feel very vulnerable in a way that i hadn't felt\n\n1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:51.720\n before and it spiraled how did you get out i did a lot of different kinds of therapy i did um\n\n1:22:52.840 --> 1:23:00.280\n starting with alternative therapies i was seeing i would say between seven and eight\n\n1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:16.040\n doctors and or therapists a week um acupuncture uh talk therapy um herbs or any any possible\n\n1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:26.920\n modality tried everything for a long time and um and and nothing seemed to have an impact and then\n\n1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:39.080\n finally um i'm wary of taking any western medicine i'm not a drug taker and or drinker\n\n1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:49.240\n partier in any way and um i found a a psychopharmacologist who was a psychic\n\n1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:55.160\n but because she was a psychic i was okay to see her because she's like i'll i'll do i'll listen\n\n1:23:55.160 --> 1:24:00.920\n to a psychic yeah but i'm not going to listen to a psychopharmacologist but the fact that she had\n\n1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:10.040\n the the psychic uh that made her fit into my world view and um and she recommended antidepressant which\n\n1:24:10.680 --> 1:24:15.560\n went terribly wrong in the first night that i took it and then i that set me on a journey\n\n1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:21.080\n of looking for the right antidepressant which was a long and painful process heck of a journey\n\n1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:27.560\n every one that i took made me sick everyone and then finally i don't know five months later six\n\n1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:36.920\n months later i found the magic one that worked for me and it um it shifted me out of the depression\n\n1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:43.960\n i took it for my camera was six months or a year and then weaned off and was okay and then i had\n\n1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:50.760\n another event some years later i think i took it again for a short period of time and got out of it\n\n1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:57.160\n and i've not needed it since were you able to kind of introspect the triggers that led to the events\n\n1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:04.200\n is there something or is it random events of life i think it's more that um\n\n1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:12.280\n because of the way that i grew up i never had to deal with much controversy\n\n1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:21.720\n ah and um when i when i was challenged i didn't have any ability to deal with it\n\n1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:27.960\n it's like um you know jonathan hight talks about it's like that so you've actually also mentioned\n\n1:25:27.960 --> 1:25:33.960\n like business sometimes gives you stress so these this was business related stuff yeah\n\n1:25:33.960 --> 1:25:39.560\n it was a business related thing it just made me feel bad it's one of the sadder things about art\n\n1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:47.160\n and music is that it's often interleaved with business folk i suppose that's the way of the\n\n1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:55.960\n world if you have a capitalist system but it makes that business folks rubbing up against artists\n\n1:25:55.960 --> 1:26:06.360\n um can sometimes destroy a fragile mind and soul like uh to me like one of the best representations\n\n1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:12.040\n of an artist honestly johnny i have the designer from apple and he's just so fragile with his\n\n1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:17.480\n ideas and you talked about like when he has ideas he really wouldn't show it to steve jobs or anybody\n\n1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:22.760\n except for a small design team because he was so nervous that it would it would break let's give\n\n1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:30.120\n it a chance let it give it a chance to grow and it seems like the outside world uh business people\n\n1:26:30.120 --> 1:26:37.480\n pr people people kind of um have not lost themselves in the passion of creating but instead\n\n1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:43.400\n of kind of representing or like making deals all that kind of stuff they they can kind of trample\n\n1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:49.880\n on those little ideas and it's it's sad to see yeah it's really it's really heartbreaking to\n\n1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:55.240\n see because you know how much trampling there's going on it's one of the main jobs my jobs as a\n\n1:26:55.240 --> 1:27:04.600\n record producer is to um keep the keep the voices away from the artist from all the people who are\n\n1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:11.160\n really on their side but don't know you know like the uh whether it be people um anyone on the\n\n1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:17.880\n business side who doesn't make things they're excited to do their part you know they're excited\n\n1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:25.160\n if when you deliver the thing the the art that you make to me then we can start the project yeah um\n\n1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:31.400\n but there's nothing to sell if the art doesn't happen in the right way and it has to be protected\n\n1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:39.400\n and it can't happen on the same kind of a timetable that um that business can it's just a\n\n1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:45.640\n different thing it doesn't art doesn't come in a quarterly way and that doesn't apply just to music\n\n1:27:45.640 --> 1:27:51.560\n or it applies to art it applies to all creative pursuits like this is generally the case like at\n\n1:27:51.560 --> 1:28:00.520\n mit it's just there's the administration and then there is the professors and students and the\n\n1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:06.280\n professors students are the creative folk yeah they create stuff they dream they have wild ideas\n\n1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:11.320\n that go on tangents and so on they they uh they have hopes and they they go with those and they\n\n1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:16.760\n get like on these weird passionate pursuits and then the administration can often just trample on\n\n1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:25.000\n that um and they they set up bars on all kinds of in all kinds of ways that you think you're not\n\n1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:34.120\n actually hurting um but you really are and you know i won't mention why but because this happens\n\n1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:39.800\n to everybody and i have a large amount of leverage at mit now but even i get a little bit of pressure\n\n1:28:39.800 --> 1:28:48.920\n in such stupid ways to like don't like be careful be careful like we really want your career to\n\n1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:55.160\n succeed be careful and that little pressure to an artist you know do you want to go acapella\n\n1:28:55.160 --> 1:29:00.280\n do you want to go do you want to do a country record like be careful like you're already a\n\n1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:06.920\n superstar be careful yeah and then in that way you kind of push people like flock of fish into\n\n1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:13.080\n one fish tank where they're all the same and it's it's sad to see and it's obviously in the modern\n\n1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:18.680\n world there's nice mechanism to protect to let artists flourish a little bit more because they\n\n1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:23.080\n get to put themselves to the world and get a little bit more confidence maybe different funding\n\n1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:29.320\n mechanisms all that kind of stuff but tremendous problem that the the voices that don't understand\n\n1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:35.560\n interfering with the process is huge the other side of it is in success there can be a lack of\n\n1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:41.000\n there can be a lack of reality where all of the people around the successful person just tell\n\n1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:47.000\n them everything they do is great and then they they don't have anything to bump up against anymore\n\n1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:57.240\n have a realistic uh sense of what's what how things work or how how it how the how things measure you\n\n1:29:57.240 --> 1:30:06.200\n know um so both sides are really important both both avoiding the voices getting in the way\n\n1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:15.080\n and having a trusted group of you know a sangha a group of people who can say you know i don't\n\n1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:20.040\n know if that's as good and you can still you know say i don't care what you think that's fine\n\n1:30:20.040 --> 1:30:29.400\n but it helps to hear it you know it helps to have if someone who you respect tells you something\n\n1:30:29.400 --> 1:30:34.280\n isn't good enough it's helpful when you know it comes from a place of love when it comes from a\n\n1:30:34.280 --> 1:30:40.200\n place of wisdom 100 percent and not from a place of fear not from a place of oh this doesn't sound\n\n1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:46.520\n like it's going to do as well as your last thing that's yeah that's not the point the point is on\n\n1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:55.960\n this uh quest for greatness are you living up to your ability by the way is there something\n\n1:30:55.960 --> 1:31:02.120\n interesting to say about your world view because you mentioned psychic and instead of the ways\n\n1:31:02.120 --> 1:31:11.160\n we can be healthy the ways we can grow and how much maybe medicine or science or has\n\n1:31:11.160 --> 1:31:17.960\n um has the answers is there is there some interesting way to describe that world view\n\n1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:21.240\n i would just say i'm open mind i believe anything's possible\n\n1:31:22.520 --> 1:31:28.040\n and if i was going to trust in any practical information it would be something thousands\n\n1:31:28.040 --> 1:31:37.320\n of years old there's wisdom in that history yeah well it's it's more tested it's not always right\n\n1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:44.760\n but it's at least it's been somewhat tested so science is also tested the thing i'm a little\n\n1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:49.560\n bit skeptical of sometimes is just the hubris that often comes with the modern with the latest\n\n1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:55.080\n the newest the this this feeling like you figured it all out everything that's been done in the past\n\n1:31:55.080 --> 1:32:01.160\n has no wisdom and uh we basically solved every problem uh you know there's nothing else to be\n\n1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:05.160\n solved this i mean that's the defining characteristic of any age is like we've\n\n1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:10.280\n solved all the problems there are we have the final answers and our parents are all stupid\n\n1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:15.480\n that kind of energy yeah and that you have to be extremely extremely careful with that when it\n\n1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:19.800\n talks about when you think about something as complex as the human body or the human mind\n\n1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:27.560\n you have to be very very very we know close to nothing yeah exactly close to nothing that's about\n\n1:32:27.560 --> 1:32:33.000\n anything about anything about anything that place of humility is a good place to start to figure\n\n1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:38.200\n to figure it all out and in the end we'll still know almost nothing yeah i don't think we need to\n\n1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:44.280\n know it's like we need to see what works and we need to see what works for us it's interesting to\n\n1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:52.360\n know i i know on the art side knowing how it works isn't what makes it work you know isn't the magic\n\n1:32:52.360 --> 1:33:00.040\n of it isn't how it works the magic is the magic and the magic happens in a way that's intuitive\n\n1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:06.440\n and accidental at times or uh incidental where you're trying many things all of a sudden something\n\n1:33:06.440 --> 1:33:13.160\n works and um and you don't know why and it's okay not to know why it doesn't matter it doesn't\n\n1:33:13.160 --> 1:33:19.560\n really matter why as long as it does the thing that you want it to do whatever that is yeah\n\n1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:25.240\n that's so weird when you know the components you don't you still yeah the magic what's the magic\n\n1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:29.880\n where's the magic like we know the components for stuff i care about artificial intelligence we know\n\n1:33:29.880 --> 1:33:38.200\n the components of a powerful computing machinery where does consciousness come from what is that\n\n1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:47.960\n uh where does the uh brilliant moments of insight come from what's that when uh even in simple games\n\n1:33:47.960 --> 1:33:54.680\n of chess or in simple where do those breakthrough ideas of taking the big risk that doesn't make any\n\n1:33:54.680 --> 1:33:58.840\n sense and then all of a sudden it becomes something beautiful yeah we don't need to understand why it\n\n1:33:58.840 --> 1:34:05.320\n just happens it just happens and often the things that end up breaking through don't break through\n\n1:34:05.320 --> 1:34:10.680\n in the way we thought or turn out to be a third iteration of something that we thought was an\n\n1:34:10.680 --> 1:34:17.800\n entirely different thing or we don't know you know it's and i i think it's if we embrace that not\n\n1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:24.440\n knowing we'll have a healthier experience going through life you made a lot it's not just music\n\n1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.600\n everything rearranging the chairs the furniture as well you've done like i said the documentary\n\n1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:38.920\n i guess you would say with paul mccartney and um you've done a podcast yourself uh broken\n\n1:34:38.920 --> 1:34:45.080\n record podcast and just you've done conversation too so what have you learned from that process\n\n1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:54.120\n about the art of conversation and also maybe what advice would you give to this uh to me about how\n\n1:34:54.680 --> 1:34:59.080\n what to do with conversation like what is interesting to you about conversation one of the\n\n1:34:59.080 --> 1:35:09.080\n things that i i like is to not feel like it's there is any stakes or that it's actually almost\n\n1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:16.200\n that it's not happening like the fact that when i came in you were setting up cameras made it less\n\n1:35:16.200 --> 1:35:21.160\n good from for me i knew that that would impact the conversation in a negative way the best version\n\n1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:27.320\n of it would be if we didn't see the cameras and if we were and we didn't see any technology\n\n1:35:27.320 --> 1:35:31.880\n and we didn't see any technology and we were just sitting at this table having a conversation\n\n1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:38.040\n maybe even if we were miked beforehand would be okay if it was necessary but then we were just\n\n1:35:38.040 --> 1:35:41.960\n sitting here having a conversation no people in the room nothing and feeling like we're just\n\n1:35:41.960 --> 1:35:53.800\n having a conversation i feel like it would get closer to um closer to the relaxed feeling same\n\n1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:58.120\n thing we do in the studios like you know you've heard of red light fever you know when uh artists\n\n1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:02.280\n get nervous when like they play a song great and then the tape starts rolling and they can't play\n\n1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:08.280\n it and it's we're all we're all to some degree like that when you were with paul mccartney i mean\n\n1:36:08.280 --> 1:36:16.200\n you're did were you cognizant of cameras we had the room black everybody who was working there\n\n1:36:16.200 --> 1:36:22.680\n was dressed in black everything was invisible that we were lit in a way where even though\n\n1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:31.000\n there were probably 20 people between 12 and 20 people working in the room within three minutes\n\n1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:36.360\n of starting the conversation paul and i were alone in the room so it that was the the feeling\n\n1:36:36.360 --> 1:36:41.080\n on occasion you'd hear a noise and it would be weird people we also had nobody was allowed to\n\n1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:48.360\n wear shoes because it had to we were trying to create this intimate space and and i know from\n\n1:36:48.360 --> 1:36:56.760\n in the recording studio when we're recording if even one person is there that's just watching\n\n1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:01.960\n and not working you know like does like there's usually i'm usually there and an engineer is there\n\n1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:07.480\n technically making it happen if anyone else is in the room it's different because then it goes from\n\n1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:13.560\n this moment where the person's doing a performance to the sense or where the person is\n\n1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:23.240\n is feeling something internally and we're capturing it to the the other version is\n\n1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:29.080\n they're performing for someone it's so interesting so like to push back in the alternatives here so\n\n1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:36.360\n one about the third person not to make people self conscious but i find that i'm so torn on that\n\n1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:42.360\n because sometimes when that person uh like um so evan is in the room here he's been in the\n\n1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:51.800\n room before he's a huge fan of yours by the way uh so he'll he'll nod yeah he'll get excited he's\n\n1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:57.480\n like and you can see that nodding and for some reason for me he's like yeah yeah you get it like\n\n1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:04.120\n yeah you get excited together i mean that's that third person can be like a really special so\n\n1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:10.760\n having an audience uh when it's a friend or somebody that has that love in them it depends\n\n1:38:10.760 --> 1:38:17.720\n on the performer right yeah some people really thrive in front of an audience and you're saying\n\n1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:23.400\n you like that simple intimacy well i like the reality of it not being i want it to be as far\n\n1:38:23.400 --> 1:38:30.600\n from a performance as possible got it and if if someone i'll tell you a story a story that just\n\n1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:36.280\n happened and it was viewed as kind of a it seemed uncool in the moment to the person that it happened\n\n1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:43.560\n to it wasn't at all um we were recording the new chili peppers album which is coming out i think\n\n1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:48.280\n any day now like uh i don't know what today's date is but within the next it maybe by the\n\n1:38:48.280 --> 1:38:56.200\n time this airs it will be out and um the band was playing in the studio and it was ripping\n\n1:38:56.200 --> 1:39:04.120\n because they play they're incredible and um one of the members walked through the control room\n\n1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:12.280\n after a particularly great performance and um the engineer said wow that solo is really great\n\n1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:21.240\n and the person who heard this said please don't say that and walked away it's like it it was\n\n1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:28.120\n not it it just changed yeah this feeling of we're in this place where we're doing this thing and\n\n1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:33.880\n there's there is no outside world yeah you know we're doing this for us we're going as deep as\n\n1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:38.760\n we can for us and as soon as there's an acknowledgement to someone else in a way\n\n1:39:39.400 --> 1:39:48.680\n it breaks the concentration of being inside of it that's so well told and but it's something\n\n1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:54.440\n about saying wow that's always great is is uh shows the it reminds you that there's an outside\n\n1:39:54.440 --> 1:40:01.800\n world but i feel like there's a way to enter the inside world as an audience so you just have to\n\n1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:10.600\n do that so it matters what you say it matters how you look it matters uh so there's like these\n\n1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:17.800\n generic compliments not generic but they they sound in the way an outside world would interact\n\n1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.760\n as opposed to in that creative thing where you're dancing around the fire together or something\n\n1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:26.280\n it was actually i can tell you there's another interesting one that happened to me and i didn't\n\n1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:32.680\n know this until i saw the film of it which was a strange one um we were recording with the avid\n\n1:40:32.680 --> 1:40:40.120\n brothers and um the song was called no hard feelings and it was this recording of no hard\n\n1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:57.800\n feelings\n\n1:41:02.360 --> 1:41:05.800\n when my body won't hold me anymore\n\n1:41:05.800 --> 1:41:14.200\n it finally lets me free well i'll be ready\n\n1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:23.160\n when my feet won't walk another such a great voice so beautiful\n\n1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:35.400\n kissed goodbye will my hands be steady when i lay down my fears my hopes and my doubts\n\n1:41:36.440 --> 1:41:47.080\n the rings on my fingers and the keys to my house with no hard feelings\n\n1:41:47.080 --> 1:42:00.920\n when the sun hangs low in the west and the light in my chest won't be kept\n\n1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:04.680\n hell today any longer\n\n1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:14.120\n when the jealousy fades away so bright so hopeful so lighthearted\n\n1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:25.640\n and it's just hallelujah and love involved love in the words\n\n1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:39.480\n love in the songs they sing in the church and no hard feelings\n\n1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:45.480\n Lord knows they have it done\n\n1:42:45.480 --> 1:42:57.320\n much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold\n\n1:42:57.320 --> 1:43:03.320\n with so much to have and more\n\n1:43:03.320 --> 1:43:21.160\n when my body won't hold me anymore it finally lets me free\n\n1:43:21.160 --> 1:43:37.160\n is he sound as good as good, yeah? yes, every bit\n\n1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:55.160\n of snow from the heavens will i join with the ocean blue or run into the savior true\n\n1:43:55.160 --> 1:44:05.160\n and shake hands laughing and walk through the night straight to the light\n\n1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:17.160\n holding the love i've known in my life and no hard feelings\n\n1:44:17.160 --> 1:44:37.160\n Lord knows they have it done much good for anyone kept me afraid and cold\n\n1:44:37.160 --> 1:44:43.160\n with so much to have and more\n\n1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:57.160\n under the burning sky i'm finally learning why\n\n1:44:57.160 --> 1:45:09.160\n it matters for me and you to say it and mean it too\n\n1:45:09.160 --> 1:45:17.160\n life is loneliness\n\n1:45:17.160 --> 1:45:21.160\n it's loneliness\n\n1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:27.160\n good as it's been to me\n\n1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:33.160\n i have no enemies\n\n1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:39.160\n i have no enemies\n\n1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:45.160\n i have no enemies\n\n1:45:45.160 -->
