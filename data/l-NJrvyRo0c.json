00:08.780\n specializing in quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology.\n\n00:08.780 --> 00:11.620\n He's the author of several popular books,\n\n00:11.620 --> 00:15.340\n one on the arrow of time called From Eternity to Here,\n\n00:15.340 --> 00:17.820\n one on the Higgs boson called Particle\n\n00:17.820 --> 00:19.140\n at the End of the Universe,\n\n00:19.140 --> 00:22.540\n and one on science and philosophy called The Big Picture\n\n00:22.540 --> 00:26.340\n on the Origins of Life, Meaning, and the Universe Itself.\n\n00:26.340 --> 00:28.700\n He has an upcoming book on quantum mechanics\n\n00:28.700 --> 00:32.660\n that you can preorder now called Something Deeply Hidden.\n\n00:32.660 --> 00:36.060\n He writes one of my favorite blogs on his website,\n\n00:36.060 --> 00:37.980\n preposterousuniverse.com.\n\n00:37.980 --> 00:40.460\n I recommend clicking on the Greatest Hits link\n\n00:40.460 --> 00:43.340\n that lists accessible, interesting posts\n\n00:43.340 --> 00:45.660\n on the arrow of time, dark matter, dark energy,\n\n00:45.660 --> 00:47.620\n the Big Bang, general relativity,\n\n00:47.620 --> 00:49.580\n string theory, quantum mechanics,\n\n00:49.580 --> 00:53.180\n and the big meta questions about the philosophy of science,\n\n00:53.180 --> 00:57.620\n God, ethics, politics, academia, and much, much more.\n\n00:57.620 --> 01:00.300\n Finally, and perhaps most famously,\n\n01:00.300 --> 01:03.660\n he's the host of a podcast called Mindscape\n\n01:03.660 --> 01:06.940\n that you should subscribe to and support on Patreon.\n\n01:06.940 --> 01:08.820\n Along with the Joe Rogan experience,\n\n01:08.820 --> 01:10.500\n Sam Harris's Making Sense,\n\n01:10.500 --> 01:13.100\n and Dan Carlin's Hardcore History,\n\n01:13.100 --> 01:15.860\n Sean's Mindscape podcast is one of my favorite ways\n\n01:15.860 --> 01:18.820\n to learn new ideas or explore different perspectives\n\n01:18.820 --> 01:22.140\n and ideas that I thought I understood.\n\n01:22.140 --> 01:24.660\n It was truly an honor to meet\n\n01:24.660 --> 01:27.240\n and spend a couple hours with Sean.\n\n01:27.240 --> 01:28.980\n It's a bit heartbreaking to say\n\n01:28.980 --> 01:30.540\n that for the first time ever,\n\n01:30.540 --> 01:32.500\n the audio recorder for this podcast\n\n01:32.500 --> 01:34.940\n died in the middle of our conversation.\n\n01:34.940 --> 01:36.320\n There's technical reasons for this,\n\n01:36.320 --> 01:38.380\n having to do with phantom power\n\n01:38.380 --> 01:41.060\n that I now understand and will avoid.\n\n01:41.060 --> 01:44.220\n It took me one hour to notice and fix the problem.\n\n01:44.220 --> 01:48.340\n So, much like the universe is 68% dark energy,\n\n01:48.340 --> 01:51.340\n roughly the same amount from this conversation was lost,\n\n01:51.340 --> 01:54.220\n except in the memories of the two people involved\n\n01:54.220 --> 01:56.320\n and in my notes.\n\n01:56.320 --> 01:59.940\n I'm sure we'll talk again and continue this conversation\n\n01:59.940 --> 02:02.420\n on this podcast or on Sean's.\n\n02:02.420 --> 02:05.300\n And of course, I look forward to it.\n\n02:05.300 --> 02:07.820\n This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast.\n\n02:07.820 --> 02:11.060\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, iTunes,\n\n02:11.060 --> 02:12.520\n support it on Patreon,\n\n02:12.520 --> 02:16.660\n or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman.\n\n02:16.660 --> 02:21.380\n And now, here's my conversation with Sean Carroll.\n\n02:21.380 --> 02:23.540\n What do you think is more interesting and impactful,\n\n02:23.540 --> 02:26.860\n understanding how the universe works at a fundamental level\n\n02:26.860 --> 02:29.180\n or understanding how the human mind works?\n\n02:29.180 --> 02:31.960\n You know, of course this is a crazy,\n\n02:31.960 --> 02:33.940\n meaningless, unanswerable question in some sense,\n\n02:33.940 --> 02:35.140\n because they're both very interesting\n\n02:35.140 --> 02:37.500\n and there's no absolute scale of interestingness\n\n02:37.500 --> 02:39.180\n that we can rate them on.\n\n02:39.180 --> 02:41.140\n There's a glib answer that says the human brain\n\n02:41.140 --> 02:43.060\n is part of the universe, right?\n\n02:43.060 --> 02:44.420\n And therefore, understanding the universe\n\n02:44.420 --> 02:47.020\n is more fundamental than understanding the human brain.\n\n02:47.020 --> 02:49.580\n But do you really believe that once we understand\n\n02:49.580 --> 02:51.500\n the fundamental way the universe works\n\n02:51.500 --> 02:53.740\n at the particle level, the forces,\n\n02:53.740 --> 02:55.820\n we would be able to understand how the mind works?\n\n02:55.820 --> 02:56.660\n No, certainly not.\n\n02:56.660 --> 02:58.740\n We cannot understand how ice cream works\n\n02:58.740 --> 03:01.060\n just from understanding how particles work, right?\n\n03:01.060 --> 03:02.740\n So I'm a big believer in emergence.\n\n03:02.740 --> 03:05.300\n I'm a big believer that there are different ways\n\n03:05.300 --> 03:06.660\n of talking about the world\n\n03:07.900 --> 03:11.180\n beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one.\n\n03:11.180 --> 03:13.860\n You know, when we talk about tables and chairs\n\n03:13.860 --> 03:15.120\n and planets and people,\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:17.300\n we're not talking the language of particle physics\n\n03:17.300 --> 03:18.380\n and cosmology.\n\n03:18.380 --> 03:20.860\n So, but understanding the universe,\n\n03:20.860 --> 03:24.060\n you didn't say just at the most fundamental level, right?\n\n03:24.060 --> 03:26.740\n So understanding the universe at all levels\n\n03:26.740 --> 03:28.200\n is part of that.\n\n03:28.200 --> 03:29.940\n I do think, you know, to be a little bit more fair\n\n03:29.940 --> 03:33.980\n to the question, there probably are general principles\n\n03:33.980 --> 03:38.500\n of complexity, biology, information processing,\n\n03:38.500 --> 03:41.820\n memory, knowledge, creativity\n\n03:41.820 --> 03:45.620\n that go beyond just the human brain, right?\n\n03:45.620 --> 03:47.800\n And maybe one could count understanding those\n\n03:47.800 --> 03:49.140\n as part of understanding the universe.\n\n03:49.140 --> 03:50.480\n The human brain, as far as we know,\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:54.300\n is the most complex thing in the universe.\n\n03:54.300 --> 03:57.420\n So there's, it's certainly absurd to think\n\n03:57.420 --> 03:58.860\n that by understanding the fundamental laws\n\n03:58.860 --> 04:00.340\n of particle physics,\n\n04:00.340 --> 04:02.860\n you get any direct insight on how the brain works.\n\n04:02.860 --> 04:05.940\n But then there's this step from the fundamentals\n\n04:05.940 --> 04:08.700\n of particle physics to information processing,\n\n04:08.700 --> 04:10.820\n which a lot of physicists and philosophers\n\n04:10.820 --> 04:12.460\n may be a little bit carelessly take\n\n04:12.460 --> 04:14.620\n when they talk about artificial intelligence.\n\n04:14.620 --> 04:18.020\n Do you think of the universe\n\n04:18.020 --> 04:21.300\n as a kind of a computational device?\n\n04:21.300 --> 04:24.140\n No, to be like, the honest answer there is no.\n\n04:24.140 --> 04:26.300\n There's a sense in which the universe\n\n04:26.300 --> 04:29.140\n processes information, clearly.\n\n04:29.140 --> 04:30.700\n There's a sense in which the universe\n\n04:30.700 --> 04:33.880\n is like a computer, clearly.\n\n04:33.880 --> 04:36.500\n But in some sense, I think,\n\n04:36.500 --> 04:38.540\n I tried to say this once on my blog\n\n04:38.540 --> 04:39.360\n and no one agreed with me,\n\n04:39.360 --> 04:42.360\n but the universe is more like a computation\n\n04:42.360 --> 04:45.060\n than a computer because the universe happens once.\n\n04:45.060 --> 04:46.900\n A computer is a general purpose machine, right?\n\n04:46.900 --> 04:48.700\n That you can ask it different questions,\n\n04:48.700 --> 04:50.140\n even a pocket calculator, right?\n\n04:50.140 --> 04:52.980\n And it's set up to answer certain kinds of questions.\n\n04:52.980 --> 04:54.340\n The universe isn't that.\n\n04:54.340 --> 04:57.360\n So information processing happens in the universe,\n\n04:57.360 --> 04:59.220\n but it's not what the universe is.\n\n04:59.220 --> 05:01.580\n And I know your MIT colleague, Seth Lloyd,\n\n05:01.580 --> 05:03.820\n feels very differently about this, right?\n\n05:03.820 --> 05:07.220\n Well, you're thinking of the universe as a closed system.\n\n05:07.220 --> 05:08.060\n I am.\n\n05:08.060 --> 05:11.780\n So what makes a computer more like a PC,\n\n05:12.980 --> 05:15.500\n like a computing machine is that there's a human\n\n05:15.500 --> 05:19.100\n that every once comes up to it and moves the mouse around.\n\n05:19.100 --> 05:19.940\n So input.\n\n05:19.940 --> 05:20.760\n Gives it input.\n\n05:20.760 --> 05:21.600\n Gives it input.\n\n05:23.500 --> 05:26.300\n And that's why you're saying it's just a computation,\n\n05:26.300 --> 05:29.260\n a deterministic thing that's just unrolling.\n\n05:29.260 --> 05:32.220\n But the immense complexity of it\n\n05:32.220 --> 05:34.420\n is nevertheless like processing.\n\n05:34.420 --> 05:39.420\n There's a state and then it changes with good rules.\n\n05:40.140 --> 05:41.660\n And there's a sense for a lot of people\n\n05:41.660 --> 05:44.420\n that if the brain operates,\n\n05:44.420 --> 05:46.460\n the human brain operates within that world,\n\n05:46.460 --> 05:49.340\n then it's simply just a small subset of that.\n\n05:49.340 --> 05:52.500\n And so there's no reason we can't build\n\n05:52.500 --> 05:55.560\n arbitrarily great intelligences.\n\n05:55.560 --> 05:56.400\n Yeah.\n\n05:56.400 --> 05:58.660\n Do you think of intelligence in this way?\n\n05:58.660 --> 05:59.580\n Intelligence is tricky.\n\n05:59.580 --> 06:01.660\n I don't have a definition of it offhand.\n\n06:01.660 --> 06:05.460\n So I remember this panel discussion that I saw on YouTube.\n\n06:05.460 --> 06:07.620\n I wasn't there, but Seth Lloyd was on the panel.\n\n06:07.620 --> 06:10.540\n And so was Martin Rees, the famous astrophysicist.\n\n06:10.540 --> 06:13.780\n And Seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer\n\n06:13.780 --> 06:14.820\n and explained this.\n\n06:14.820 --> 06:19.140\n And Martin Rees said, so what is not a computer?\n\n06:19.140 --> 06:22.000\n And Seth was like, oh, that's a good question.\n\n06:22.000 --> 06:22.840\n I'm not sure.\n\n06:22.840 --> 06:24.960\n Because if you have a sufficiently broad definition\n\n06:24.960 --> 06:28.360\n of what a computer is, then everything is, right?\n\n06:28.360 --> 06:32.140\n And the simile or the analogy gains force\n\n06:32.140 --> 06:34.380\n when it excludes some things.\n\n06:34.380 --> 06:36.260\n You know, is the moon going around the earth\n\n06:36.260 --> 06:38.620\n performing a computation?\n\n06:38.620 --> 06:41.320\n I can come up with definitions in which the answer is yes,\n\n06:41.320 --> 06:43.820\n but it's not a very useful computation.\n\n06:43.820 --> 06:46.140\n I think that it's absolutely helpful\n\n06:46.140 --> 06:49.620\n to think about the universe in certain situations,\n\n06:49.620 --> 06:53.020\n certain contexts, as an information processing device.\n\n06:53.020 --> 06:54.860\n I'm even guilty of writing a paper\n\n06:54.860 --> 06:56.820\n called Quantum Circuit Cosmology,\n\n06:56.820 --> 06:59.260\n where we modeled the whole universe as a quantum circuit.\n\n06:59.260 --> 07:00.100\n As a circuit.\n\n07:00.100 --> 07:01.340\n As a circuit, yeah.\n\n07:01.340 --> 07:02.860\n With qubits kind of thing?\n\n07:02.860 --> 07:05.040\n With qubits basically, right, yeah.\n\n07:05.040 --> 07:07.440\n So, and qubits becoming more and more entangled.\n\n07:07.440 --> 07:09.660\n So do we wanna digress a little bit?\n\n07:09.660 --> 07:10.500\n Let's do it.\n\n07:10.500 --> 07:11.340\n It's kind of fun.\n\n07:11.340 --> 07:13.700\n So here's a mystery about the universe\n\n07:13.700 --> 07:16.880\n that is so deep and profound that nobody talks about it.\n\n07:16.880 --> 07:19.080\n Space expands, right?\n\n07:19.080 --> 07:21.940\n And we talk about, in a certain region of space,\n\n07:21.940 --> 07:23.620\n a certain number of degrees of freedom,\n\n07:23.620 --> 07:25.540\n a certain number of ways that the quantum fields\n\n07:25.540 --> 07:28.800\n and the particles in that region can arrange themselves.\n\n07:28.800 --> 07:32.220\n That number of degrees of freedom in a region of space\n\n07:32.220 --> 07:33.820\n is arguably finite.\n\n07:33.820 --> 07:36.660\n We actually don't know how many there are,\n\n07:36.660 --> 07:37.820\n but there's a very good argument\n\n07:37.820 --> 07:39.420\n that says it's a finite number.\n\n07:39.420 --> 07:43.540\n So as the universe expands and space gets bigger,\n\n07:44.900 --> 07:46.780\n are there more degrees of freedom?\n\n07:46.780 --> 07:48.540\n If it's an infinite number, it doesn't really matter.\n\n07:48.540 --> 07:49.980\n Infinity times two is still infinity.\n\n07:49.980 --> 07:53.480\n But if it's a finite number, then there's more space,\n\n07:53.480 --> 07:54.420\n so there's more degrees of freedom.\n\n07:54.420 --> 07:55.740\n So where did they come from?\n\n07:55.740 --> 07:58.020\n That would mean the universe is not a closed system.\n\n07:58.020 --> 08:01.500\n There's more degrees of freedom popping into existence.\n\n08:01.500 --> 08:03.460\n So what we suggested was\n\n08:03.460 --> 08:05.340\n that there are more degrees of freedom,\n\n08:05.340 --> 08:07.980\n and it's not that they're not there to start,\n\n08:07.980 --> 08:10.860\n but they're not entangled to start.\n\n08:10.860 --> 08:12.820\n So the universe that you and I know of,\n\n08:12.820 --> 08:15.440\n the three dimensions around us that we see,\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:18.100\n we said those are the entangled degrees of freedom\n\n08:18.100 --> 08:19.620\n making up space time.\n\n08:19.620 --> 08:20.920\n And as the universe expands,\n\n08:20.920 --> 08:25.180\n there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state\n\n08:25.180 --> 08:28.140\n that become entangled with the rest of space time\n\n08:28.140 --> 08:31.180\n through the action of these quantum circuits.\n\n08:31.180 --> 08:35.580\n So what does it mean that there's now more\n\n08:35.580 --> 08:39.300\n degrees of freedom as they become more entangled?\n\n08:39.300 --> 08:40.300\n Yeah, so.\n\n08:40.300 --> 08:41.660\n As the universe expands.\n\n08:41.660 --> 08:43.300\n That's right, so there's more and more degrees of freedom\n\n08:43.300 --> 08:46.420\n that are entangled, that are playing part,\n\n08:46.420 --> 08:47.360\n playing the role of part\n\n08:47.360 --> 08:49.600\n of the entangled space time structure.\n\n08:49.600 --> 08:51.980\n So the basic, the underlying philosophy is\n\n08:51.980 --> 08:54.620\n that space time itself arises from the entanglement\n\n08:54.620 --> 08:57.560\n of some fundamental quantum degrees of freedom.\n\n08:57.560 --> 09:00.820\n Wow, okay, so at which point\n\n09:00.820 --> 09:05.260\n is most of the entanglement happening?\n\n09:05.260 --> 09:07.460\n Are we talking about close to the Big Bang?\n\n09:07.460 --> 09:11.820\n Are we talking about throughout the time of the life?\n\n09:11.820 --> 09:12.660\n Throughout history, yeah.\n\n09:12.660 --> 09:15.140\n So the idea is that at the Big Bang,\n\n09:15.140 --> 09:16.780\n almost all the degrees of freedom\n\n09:16.780 --> 09:19.700\n that the universe could have were there,\n\n09:19.700 --> 09:22.420\n but they were unentangled with anything else.\n\n09:22.420 --> 09:23.900\n And that's a reflection of the fact\n\n09:23.900 --> 09:25.620\n that the Big Bang had a low entropy.\n\n09:25.620 --> 09:28.020\n It was a very simple, very small place.\n\n09:28.020 --> 09:31.420\n And as space expands, more and more degrees of freedom\n\n09:31.420 --> 09:34.300\n become entangled with the rest of the world.\n\n09:34.300 --> 09:35.940\n Well, I have to ask John Carroll,\n\n09:35.940 --> 09:37.880\n what do you think of the thought experiment\n\n09:37.880 --> 09:41.580\n from Nick Bostrom that we're living in a simulation?\n\n09:41.580 --> 09:44.980\n So I think, let me contextualize that a little bit more.\n\n09:44.980 --> 09:48.340\n I think people don't actually take this thought experiments.\n\n09:48.340 --> 09:50.460\n I think it's quite interesting.\n\n09:50.460 --> 09:52.900\n It's not very useful, but it's quite interesting.\n\n09:52.900 --> 09:54.500\n From the perspective of AI,\n\n09:54.500 --> 09:58.020\n a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens\n\n09:58.020 --> 10:00.580\n in simulation from artificial examples.\n\n10:00.580 --> 10:03.840\n And so it's a constructive question to ask,\n\n10:04.900 --> 10:08.240\n how difficult is our real world to simulate?\n\n10:08.240 --> 10:09.360\n Right.\n\n10:09.360 --> 10:12.180\n Which is kind of a dual part of,\n\n10:12.180 --> 10:14.100\n if we're living in a simulation\n\n10:14.100 --> 10:16.420\n and somebody built that simulation,\n\n10:16.420 --> 10:18.860\n if you were to try to do it yourself, how hard would it be?\n\n10:18.860 --> 10:21.100\n So obviously we could be living in a simulation.\n\n10:21.100 --> 10:23.000\n If you just want the physical possibility,\n\n10:23.000 --> 10:25.420\n then I completely agree that it's physically possible.\n\n10:25.420 --> 10:27.380\n I don't think that we actually are.\n\n10:27.380 --> 10:30.300\n So take this one piece of data into consideration.\n\n10:30.300 --> 10:33.960\n You know, we live in a big universe, okay?\n\n10:35.140 --> 10:38.500\n There's two trillion galaxies in our observable universe\n\n10:38.500 --> 10:41.660\n with 200 billion stars in each galaxy, et cetera.\n\n10:41.660 --> 10:44.940\n It would seem to be a waste of resources\n\n10:44.940 --> 10:46.540\n to have a universe that big going on\n\n10:46.540 --> 10:47.540\n just to do a simulation.\n\n10:47.540 --> 10:50.140\n So in other words, I want to be a good Bayesian.\n\n10:50.140 --> 10:52.940\n I want to ask under this hypothesis,\n\n10:52.940 --> 10:54.960\n what do I expect to see?\n\n10:54.960 --> 10:56.780\n So the first thing I would say is I wouldn't expect\n\n10:56.780 --> 11:00.340\n to see a universe that was that big, okay?\n\n11:00.340 --> 11:02.540\n The second thing is I wouldn't expect the resolution\n\n11:02.540 --> 11:05.020\n of the universe to be as good as it is.\n\n11:05.020 --> 11:08.740\n So it's always possible that if our superhuman simulators\n\n11:08.740 --> 11:09.900\n only have finite resources,\n\n11:09.900 --> 11:12.420\n that they don't render the entire universe, right?\n\n11:12.420 --> 11:14.340\n That the part that is out there,\n\n11:14.340 --> 11:16.300\n the two trillion galaxies,\n\n11:16.300 --> 11:19.640\n isn't actually being simulated fully, okay?\n\n11:19.640 --> 11:22.740\n But then the obvious extrapolation of that\n\n11:22.740 --> 11:25.500\n is that only I am being simulated fully.\n\n11:25.500 --> 11:29.220\n Like the rest of you are just non player characters, right?\n\n11:29.220 --> 11:30.520\n I'm the only thing that is real.\n\n11:30.520 --> 11:32.780\n The rest of you are just chat bots.\n\n11:32.780 --> 11:34.320\n Beyond this wall, I see the wall,\n\n11:34.320 --> 11:36.020\n but there is literally nothing\n\n11:36.020 --> 11:37.360\n on the other side of the wall.\n\n11:37.360 --> 11:39.300\n That is sort of the Bayesian prediction.\n\n11:39.300 --> 11:40.180\n That's what it would be like\n\n11:40.180 --> 11:42.240\n to do an efficient simulation of me.\n\n11:42.240 --> 11:45.700\n So like none of that seems quite realistic.\n\n11:45.700 --> 11:50.700\n I don't see, I hear the argument that it's just possible\n\n11:50.900 --> 11:53.300\n and easy to simulate lots of things.\n\n11:53.300 --> 11:55.780\n I don't see any evidence from what we know\n\n11:55.780 --> 11:59.340\n about our universe that we look like a simulated universe.\n\n11:59.340 --> 12:00.180\n Now, maybe you can say,\n\n12:00.180 --> 12:01.980\n well, we don't know what it would look like,\n\n12:01.980 --> 12:04.520\n but that's just abandoning your Bayesian responsibilities.\n\n12:04.520 --> 12:07.660\n Like your job is to say under this theory,\n\n12:07.660 --> 12:09.500\n here's what you would expect to see.\n\n12:09.500 --> 12:11.660\n Yeah, so certainly if you think about simulation\n\n12:11.660 --> 12:14.340\n as a thing that's like a video game\n\n12:14.340 --> 12:17.740\n where only a small subset is being rendered.\n\n12:17.740 --> 12:22.740\n But say the entire, all the laws of physics,\n\n12:22.740 --> 12:26.540\n the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe,\n\n12:26.540 --> 12:27.780\n it had a creator.\n\n12:27.780 --> 12:29.320\n Yeah, it's always possible.\n\n12:29.320 --> 12:32.280\n Right, so that's not useful to think about\n\n12:32.280 --> 12:34.020\n when you're thinking about physics.\n\n12:34.020 --> 12:36.220\n The way Nick Bostrom phrases it,\n\n12:36.220 --> 12:39.100\n if it's possible to simulate a universe,\n\n12:39.100 --> 12:40.500\n eventually we'll do it.\n\n12:40.500 --> 12:41.340\n Right.\n\n12:42.700 --> 12:44.860\n You can use that by the way for a lot of things.\n\n12:44.860 --> 12:45.700\n Well, yeah.\n\n12:45.700 --> 12:48.540\n But I guess the question is,\n\n12:48.540 --> 12:52.340\n how hard is it to create a universe?\n\n12:52.340 --> 12:53.820\n I wrote a little blog post about this\n\n12:53.820 --> 12:55.460\n and maybe I'm missing something,\n\n12:55.460 --> 12:57.680\n but there's an argument that says not only\n\n12:57.680 --> 13:00.500\n that it might be possible to simulate a universe,\n\n13:00.500 --> 13:05.500\n but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute\n\n13:05.980 --> 13:08.860\n consciousness and agency to the little things\n\n13:08.860 --> 13:12.020\n that we're simulating, to our little artificial beings,\n\n13:12.020 --> 13:13.420\n there's probably a lot more of them\n\n13:13.420 --> 13:15.500\n than there are ordinary organic beings in the universe\n\n13:15.500 --> 13:17.420\n or there will be in the future, right?\n\n13:17.420 --> 13:18.500\n So there's an argument that not only\n\n13:18.500 --> 13:20.760\n is being a simulation possible,\n\n13:20.760 --> 13:23.560\n it's probable because in the space\n\n13:23.560 --> 13:24.960\n of all living consciousnesses,\n\n13:24.960 --> 13:26.620\n most of them are being simulated, right?\n\n13:26.620 --> 13:28.860\n Most of them are not at the top level.\n\n13:28.860 --> 13:30.540\n I think that argument must be wrong\n\n13:30.540 --> 13:33.100\n because it follows from that argument that,\n\n13:33.100 --> 13:36.920\n if we're simulated, but we can also simulate other things,\n\n13:36.920 --> 13:38.840\n well, but if we can simulate other things,\n\n13:38.840 --> 13:41.840\n they can simulate other things, right?\n\n13:41.840 --> 13:44.320\n If we give them enough power and resolution\n\n13:44.320 --> 13:45.980\n and ultimately we'll reach a bottom\n\n13:45.980 --> 13:49.140\n because the laws of physics in our universe have a bottom,\n\n13:49.140 --> 13:51.000\n we're made of atoms and so forth,\n\n13:51.000 --> 13:55.100\n so there will be the cheapest possible simulations.\n\n13:55.100 --> 13:57.700\n And if you believe the original argument,\n\n13:57.700 --> 13:59.340\n you should conclude that we should be\n\n13:59.340 --> 14:00.940\n in the cheapest possible simulation\n\n14:00.940 --> 14:02.660\n because that's where most people are.\n\n14:02.660 --> 14:03.620\n But we don't look like that.\n\n14:03.620 --> 14:06.860\n It doesn't look at all like we're at the edge of resolution,\n\n14:06.860 --> 14:09.540\n that we're 16 bit things.\n\n14:09.540 --> 14:13.020\n It seems much easier to make much lower level things\n\n14:13.020 --> 14:13.860\n than we are.\n\n14:14.980 --> 14:18.220\n And also, I questioned the whole approach\n\n14:18.220 --> 14:19.460\n to the anthropic principle\n\n14:19.460 --> 14:22.340\n that says we are typical observers in the universe.\n\n14:22.340 --> 14:23.660\n I think that that's not actually,\n\n14:23.660 --> 14:27.340\n I think that there's a lot of selection that we can do\n\n14:27.340 --> 14:30.180\n that we're typical within things we already know,\n\n14:30.180 --> 14:32.280\n but not typical within all of the universe.\n\n14:32.280 --> 14:35.800\n So do you think there's intelligent life,\n\n14:35.800 --> 14:37.860\n however you would like to define intelligent life,\n\n14:37.860 --> 14:39.940\n out there in the universe?\n\n14:39.940 --> 14:44.660\n My guess is that there is not intelligent life\n\n14:44.660 --> 14:48.820\n in the observable universe other than us, simply\n\n14:48.820 --> 14:52.540\n on the basis of the fact that the likely number\n\n14:52.540 --> 14:56.340\n of other intelligent species in the observable universe,\n\n14:56.340 --> 15:00.320\n there's two likely numbers, zero or billions.\n\n15:01.500 --> 15:02.580\n And if there had been billions,\n\n15:02.580 --> 15:04.140\n you would have noticed already.\n\n15:05.300 --> 15:07.340\n For there to be literally like a small number,\n\n15:07.340 --> 15:09.380\n like, you know, Star Trek,\n\n15:09.380 --> 15:13.300\n there's a dozen intelligent civilizations in our galaxy,\n\n15:13.300 --> 15:17.340\n but not a billion, that's weird.\n\n15:17.340 --> 15:18.500\n That's sort of bizarre to me.\n\n15:18.500 --> 15:21.020\n It's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others\n\n15:21.020 --> 15:22.620\n because there's just a big bottleneck\n\n15:22.620 --> 15:24.980\n to making multicellular life\n\n15:24.980 --> 15:27.020\n or technological life or whatever.\n\n15:27.020 --> 15:28.580\n It's very hard for me to imagine\n\n15:28.580 --> 15:30.140\n that there's a whole bunch out there\n\n15:30.140 --> 15:32.300\n that have somehow remained hidden from us.\n\n15:32.300 --> 15:34.700\n The question I'd like to ask\n\n15:34.700 --> 15:36.820\n is what would intelligent life look like?\n\n15:38.140 --> 15:40.500\n What I mean by that question and where it's going\n\n15:40.500 --> 15:45.500\n is what if intelligent life is just in some very big ways\n\n15:47.260 --> 15:51.500\n different than the one that has on Earth?\n\n15:51.500 --> 15:53.900\n That there's all kinds of intelligent life\n\n15:53.900 --> 15:55.420\n that operates at different scales\n\n15:55.420 --> 15:57.300\n of both size and temporal.\n\n15:57.300 --> 15:59.300\n Right, that's a great possibility\n\n15:59.300 --> 16:00.800\n because I think we should be humble\n\n16:00.800 --> 16:02.640\n about what intelligence is, what life is.\n\n16:02.640 --> 16:04.020\n We don't even agree on what life is,\n\n16:04.020 --> 16:07.020\n much less what intelligent life is, right?\n\n16:07.020 --> 16:08.980\n So that's an argument for humility,\n\n16:08.980 --> 16:10.860\n saying there could be intelligent life\n\n16:10.860 --> 16:13.620\n of a very different character, right?\n\n16:13.620 --> 16:18.060\n Like you could imagine the dolphins are intelligent\n\n16:18.060 --> 16:20.500\n but never invent space travel\n\n16:20.500 --> 16:21.460\n because they live in the ocean\n\n16:21.460 --> 16:23.220\n and they don't have thumbs, right?\n\n16:24.180 --> 16:27.860\n So they never invent technology, they never invent smelting.\n\n16:27.860 --> 16:32.020\n Maybe the universe is full of intelligent species\n\n16:32.020 --> 16:34.060\n that just don't make technology, right?\n\n16:34.060 --> 16:36.320\n That's compatible with the data, I think.\n\n16:36.320 --> 16:39.840\n And I think maybe what you're pointing at\n\n16:39.840 --> 16:44.440\n is even more out there versions of intelligence,\n\n16:44.440 --> 16:47.560\n intelligence in intermolecular clouds\n\n16:47.560 --> 16:49.440\n or on the surface of a neutron star\n\n16:49.440 --> 16:51.760\n or in between the galaxies in giant things\n\n16:51.760 --> 16:54.560\n where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million years.\n\n16:56.440 --> 16:58.080\n On the one hand, yes,\n\n16:58.080 --> 16:59.860\n we should be very open minded about those things.\n\n16:59.860 --> 17:04.860\n On the other hand, all of us share the same laws of physics.\n\n17:04.860 --> 17:08.240\n There might be something about the laws of physics,\n\n17:08.240 --> 17:09.400\n even though we don't currently know\n\n17:09.400 --> 17:10.920\n exactly what that thing would be,\n\n17:10.920 --> 17:15.920\n that makes meters and years\n\n17:16.160 --> 17:18.920\n the right length and timescales for intelligent life.\n\n17:19.880 --> 17:22.240\n Maybe not, but we're made of atoms,\n\n17:22.240 --> 17:23.780\n atoms have a certain size,\n\n17:23.780 --> 17:27.280\n we orbit stars or stars have a certain lifetime.\n\n17:27.280 --> 17:30.300\n It's not impossible to me that there's a sweet spot\n\n17:30.300 --> 17:32.200\n for intelligent life that we find ourselves in.\n\n17:32.200 --> 17:33.800\n So I'm open minded either way,\n\n17:33.800 --> 17:35.280\n I'm open minded either being humble\n\n17:35.280 --> 17:37.080\n and there's all sorts of different kinds of life\n\n17:37.080 --> 17:39.280\n or no, there's a reason we just don't know it yet\n\n17:39.280 --> 17:42.080\n why life like ours is the kind of life that's out there.\n\n17:42.080 --> 17:43.320\n Yeah, I'm of two minds too,\n\n17:43.320 --> 17:47.200\n but I often wonder if our brains is just designed\n\n17:47.200 --> 17:52.200\n to quite obviously to operate and see the world\n\n17:52.720 --> 17:56.360\n in these timescales and we're almost blind\n\n17:56.360 --> 18:01.200\n and the tools we've created for detecting things are blind\n\n18:01.200 --> 18:02.760\n to the kind of observation needed\n\n18:02.760 --> 18:04.920\n to see intelligent life at other scales.\n\n18:04.920 --> 18:07.040\n Well, I'm totally open to that,\n\n18:07.040 --> 18:09.240\n but so here's another argument I would make,\n\n18:09.240 --> 18:11.520\n we have looked for intelligent life,\n\n18:11.520 --> 18:14.120\n but we've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can,\n\n18:14.120 --> 18:16.600\n by turning radio telescopes to the sky.\n\n18:16.600 --> 18:21.040\n And why in the world would a super advanced civilization\n\n18:21.040 --> 18:24.040\n randomly beam out radio signals wastefully\n\n18:24.040 --> 18:25.440\n in all directions into the universe?\n\n18:25.440 --> 18:27.280\n That just doesn't make any sense,\n\n18:27.280 --> 18:29.100\n especially because in order to think\n\n18:29.100 --> 18:32.020\n that you would actually contact another civilization,\n\n18:32.020 --> 18:33.840\n you would have to do it forever,\n\n18:33.840 --> 18:35.840\n you have to keep doing it for millions of years,\n\n18:35.840 --> 18:38.280\n that sounds like a waste of resources.\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:43.120\n If you thought that there were other solar systems\n\n18:43.120 --> 18:44.520\n with planets around them,\n\n18:44.520 --> 18:47.000\n where maybe intelligent life didn't yet exist,\n\n18:47.000 --> 18:48.600\n but might someday,\n\n18:48.600 --> 18:51.380\n you wouldn't try to talk to it with radio waves,\n\n18:51.380 --> 18:53.600\n you would send a spacecraft out there\n\n18:53.600 --> 18:55.560\n and you would park it around there\n\n18:55.560 --> 18:57.360\n and it would be like, from our point of view,\n\n18:57.360 --> 19:00.700\n it'd be like 2001, where there was a monolith.\n\n19:00.700 --> 19:01.540\n Monolith.\n\n19:01.540 --> 19:02.380\n There could be an artifact,\n\n19:02.380 --> 19:04.520\n in fact, the other way works also, right?\n\n19:04.520 --> 19:07.360\n There could be artifacts in our solar system\n\n19:08.440 --> 19:10.480\n that have been put there\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:12.280\n by other technologically advanced civilizations\n\n19:12.280 --> 19:14.640\n and that's how we will eventually contact them.\n\n19:14.640 --> 19:16.840\n We just haven't explored the solar system well enough yet\n\n19:16.840 --> 19:17.680\n to find them.\n\n19:18.580 --> 19:20.000\n The reason why we don't think about that\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:21.520\n is because we're young and impatient, right?\n\n19:21.520 --> 19:24.000\n Like, it would take more than my lifetime\n\n19:24.000 --> 19:26.080\n to actually send something to another star system\n\n19:26.080 --> 19:27.800\n and wait for it and then come back.\n\n19:27.800 --> 19:30.800\n So, but if we start thinking on hundreds of thousands\n\n19:30.800 --> 19:32.720\n of years or million year time scales,\n\n19:32.720 --> 19:34.600\n that's clearly the right thing to do.\n\n19:34.600 --> 19:36.800\n Are you excited by the thing\n\n19:36.800 --> 19:39.360\n that Elon Musk is doing with SpaceX in general?\n\n19:39.360 --> 19:41.620\n Space, but the idea of space exploration,\n\n19:41.620 --> 19:45.360\n even though your, or your species is young and impatient?\n\n19:45.360 --> 19:46.200\n Yeah.\n\n19:46.200 --> 19:49.200\n No, I do think that space travel is crucially important,\n\n19:49.200 --> 19:50.800\n long term.\n\n19:50.800 --> 19:52.500\n Even to other star systems.\n\n19:52.500 --> 19:57.500\n And I think that many people overestimate the difficulty\n\n19:57.500 --> 20:00.940\n because they say, look, if you travel 1% the speed of light\n\n20:00.940 --> 20:02.020\n to another star system,\n\n20:02.020 --> 20:04.060\n we'll be dead before we get there, right?\n\n20:04.060 --> 20:06.180\n And I think that it's much easier.\n\n20:06.180 --> 20:08.120\n And therefore, when they write their science fiction stories,\n\n20:08.120 --> 20:09.580\n they imagine we'd go faster than the speed of light\n\n20:09.580 --> 20:11.700\n because otherwise they're too impatient, right?\n\n20:11.700 --> 20:13.600\n We're not gonna go faster than the speed of light,\n\n20:13.600 --> 20:16.020\n but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan\n\n20:16.020 --> 20:18.100\n gets extended to thousands of years.\n\n20:18.100 --> 20:19.140\n And once you do that,\n\n20:19.140 --> 20:21.180\n then the stars are much closer effectively, right?\n\n20:21.180 --> 20:23.260\n And then what's a hundred year trip, right?\n\n20:23.260 --> 20:25.820\n So I think that that's gonna be the future,\n\n20:25.820 --> 20:28.700\n the far future, not my lifetime once again,\n\n20:28.700 --> 20:30.380\n but baby steps.\n\n20:30.380 --> 20:32.420\n Unless your lifetime gets extended.\n\n20:32.420 --> 20:34.740\n Well, it's in a race against time, right?\n\n20:34.740 --> 20:37.340\n A friend of mine who actually thinks about these things\n\n20:37.340 --> 20:40.460\n said, you know, you and I are gonna die,\n\n20:40.460 --> 20:43.060\n but I don't know about our grandchildren.\n\n20:43.060 --> 20:45.940\n That's, I don't know, predicting the future is hard,\n\n20:45.940 --> 20:47.900\n but that's at least a plausible scenario.\n\n20:47.900 --> 20:51.820\n And so, yeah, no, I think that as we discussed earlier,\n\n20:51.820 --> 20:56.780\n there are threats to the earth, known and unknown, right?\n\n20:56.780 --> 21:01.780\n Having spread humanity and biology elsewhere\n\n21:02.580 --> 21:04.940\n is a really important longterm goal.\n\n21:04.940 --> 21:08.900\n What kind of questions can science not currently answer,\n\n21:08.900 --> 21:09.920\n but might soon?\n\n21:11.480 --> 21:13.860\n When you think about the problems and the mysteries\n\n21:13.860 --> 21:17.840\n before us that may be within reach of science.\n\n21:17.840 --> 21:20.300\n I think an obvious one is the origin of life.\n\n21:20.300 --> 21:22.780\n We don't know how that happened.\n\n21:22.780 --> 21:25.300\n There's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically\n\n21:25.300 --> 21:27.240\n actually, you know, literally on earth,\n\n21:27.240 --> 21:30.500\n but starting life from non life is something\n\n21:30.500 --> 21:32.420\n I kind of think we're close to, right?\n\n21:32.420 --> 21:33.240\n We're really.\n\n21:33.240 --> 21:34.080\n You really think so?\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:36.740\n Like how difficult is it to start life?\n\n21:36.740 --> 21:39.260\n Well, I've talked to people,\n\n21:39.260 --> 21:41.780\n including on the podcast about this.\n\n21:41.780 --> 21:43.340\n You know, life requires three things.\n\n21:43.340 --> 21:44.220\n Life as we know it.\n\n21:44.220 --> 21:45.500\n So there's a difference with life,\n\n21:45.500 --> 21:47.060\n which who knows what it is,\n\n21:47.060 --> 21:48.140\n and life as we know it,\n\n21:48.140 --> 21:50.780\n which we can talk about with some intelligence.\n\n21:50.780 --> 21:53.840\n So life as we know it requires compartmentalization.\n\n21:53.840 --> 21:56.660\n You need like a little membrane around your cell.\n\n21:56.660 --> 21:58.980\n Metabolism, you need to take in food and eat it\n\n21:58.980 --> 22:01.020\n and let that make you do things.\n\n22:01.020 --> 22:02.620\n And then replication, okay?\n\n22:02.620 --> 22:04.620\n So you need to have some information about who you are\n\n22:04.620 --> 22:07.880\n that you pass down to future generations.\n\n22:07.880 --> 22:11.780\n In the lab, compartmentalization seems pretty easy.\n\n22:11.780 --> 22:13.780\n Not hard to make lipid bilayers\n\n22:13.780 --> 22:16.760\n that come into little cellular walls pretty easily.\n\n22:16.760 --> 22:19.260\n Metabolism and replication are hard,\n\n22:20.160 --> 22:21.900\n but replication we're close to.\n\n22:21.900 --> 22:24.960\n People have made RNA like molecules in the lab\n\n22:24.960 --> 22:28.840\n that I think the state of the art is,\n\n22:28.840 --> 22:30.660\n they're not able to make one molecule\n\n22:30.660 --> 22:32.060\n that reproduces itself,\n\n22:32.060 --> 22:33.600\n but they're able to make two molecules\n\n22:33.600 --> 22:35.260\n that reproduce each other.\n\n22:35.260 --> 22:36.100\n So that's okay.\n\n22:36.100 --> 22:37.100\n That's pretty close.\n\n22:38.060 --> 22:41.060\n Metabolism is harder, believe it or not,\n\n22:41.060 --> 22:42.900\n even though it's sort of the most obvious thing,\n\n22:42.900 --> 22:44.940\n but you want some sort of controlled metabolism\n\n22:44.940 --> 22:47.500\n and the actual cellular machinery in our bodies\n\n22:47.500 --> 22:48.660\n is quite complicated.\n\n22:48.660 --> 22:50.940\n It's hard to see it just popping into existence\n\n22:50.940 --> 22:51.780\n all by itself.\n\n22:51.780 --> 22:52.860\n It probably took a while,\n\n22:53.740 --> 22:56.100\n but we're making progress.\n\n22:56.100 --> 22:57.240\n And in fact, I don't think we're spending\n\n22:57.240 --> 22:58.580\n nearly enough money on it.\n\n22:58.580 --> 23:01.780\n If I were the NSF, I would flood this area with money\n\n23:01.780 --> 23:05.220\n because it would change our view of the world\n\n23:05.220 --> 23:06.780\n if we could actually make life in the lab\n\n23:06.780 --> 23:09.420\n and understand how it was made originally here on earth.\n\n23:09.420 --> 23:11.160\n And I'm sure it'd have some ripple effects\n\n23:11.160 --> 23:12.940\n that help cure disease and so on.\n\n23:12.940 --> 23:14.380\n I mean, just that understanding.\n\n23:14.380 --> 23:16.700\n So synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier\n\n23:16.700 --> 23:17.980\n where we're making cells.\n\n23:18.940 --> 23:21.100\n Right now, the best way to do that\n\n23:21.100 --> 23:23.620\n is to borrow heavily from existing biology, right?\n\n23:23.620 --> 23:25.380\n Well, Craig Venter several years ago\n\n23:25.380 --> 23:28.220\n created an artificial cell, but all he did was,\n\n23:28.220 --> 23:29.860\n not all he did, it was a tremendous accomplishment,\n\n23:29.860 --> 23:33.180\n but all he did was take out the DNA from a cell\n\n23:33.180 --> 23:37.200\n and put in entirely new DNA and let it boot up and go.\n\n23:37.200 --> 23:42.200\n What about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth?\n\n23:43.420 --> 23:44.260\n Yeah.\n\n23:44.260 --> 23:45.860\n Again, we define intelligence, of course,\n\n23:45.860 --> 23:49.860\n but let's just even say Homo sapiens,\n\n23:49.860 --> 23:54.480\n the modern intelligence in our human brain.\n\n23:55.340 --> 23:58.660\n Do you have a sense of what's involved in that leap\n\n23:58.660 --> 24:00.420\n and how big of a leap that is?\n\n24:00.420 --> 24:03.300\n So AI would count in this, or do you really want life?\n\n24:03.300 --> 24:06.420\n Do you want really an organism in some sense?\n\n24:06.420 --> 24:07.540\n AI would count, I think.\n\n24:07.540 --> 24:08.980\n Okay.\n\n24:08.980 --> 24:11.020\n Yeah, of course, of course AI would count.\n\n24:11.020 --> 24:13.460\n Well, let's say artificial consciousness, right?\n\n24:13.460 --> 24:15.500\n So I do not think we are on the threshold\n\n24:15.500 --> 24:16.760\n of creating artificial consciousness.\n\n24:16.760 --> 24:18.180\n I think it's possible.\n\n24:18.180 --> 24:20.300\n I'm not, again, very educated about how close we are,\n\n24:20.300 --> 24:22.100\n but my impression is not that we're really close\n\n24:22.100 --> 24:24.820\n because we understand how little we understand\n\n24:24.820 --> 24:26.460\n of consciousness and what it is.\n\n24:26.460 --> 24:28.440\n So if we don't have any idea what it is,\n\n24:28.440 --> 24:29.780\n it's hard to imagine we're on the threshold\n\n24:29.780 --> 24:31.620\n of making it ourselves.\n\n24:32.500 --> 24:34.500\n But it's doable, it's possible.\n\n24:34.500 --> 24:35.960\n I don't see any obstacles in principle.\n\n24:35.960 --> 24:38.160\n So yeah, I would hold out some interest\n\n24:38.160 --> 24:40.220\n in that happening eventually.\n\n24:40.220 --> 24:42.700\n I think in general, consciousness,\n\n24:42.700 --> 24:44.420\n I think we would be just surprised\n\n24:44.420 --> 24:49.060\n how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence.\n\n24:49.060 --> 24:50.540\n I think consciousness is a thing\n\n24:50.540 --> 24:54.000\n that's just something we all fake.\n\n24:55.540 --> 24:56.380\n Well, good.\n\n24:56.380 --> 24:57.680\n No, actually, I like this idea that in fact,\n\n24:57.680 --> 25:00.500\n consciousness is way less mysterious than we think\n\n25:00.500 --> 25:02.620\n because we're all at every time, at every moment,\n\n25:02.620 --> 25:04.500\n less conscious than we think we are, right?\n\n25:04.500 --> 25:05.460\n We can fool things.\n\n25:05.460 --> 25:07.780\n And I think that plus the idea\n\n25:07.780 --> 25:11.180\n that you not only have artificial intelligent systems,\n\n25:11.180 --> 25:12.980\n but you put them in a body, right,\n\n25:12.980 --> 25:14.280\n give them a robot body,\n\n25:15.620 --> 25:18.460\n that will help the faking a lot.\n\n25:18.460 --> 25:20.980\n Yeah, I think creating consciousness\n\n25:20.980 --> 25:25.140\n in artificial consciousness is as simple\n\n25:25.140 --> 25:30.020\n as asking a Roomba to say, I'm conscious,\n\n25:30.020 --> 25:32.780\n and refusing to be talked out of it.\n\n25:32.780 --> 25:33.820\n Could be, it could be.\n\n25:33.820 --> 25:36.740\n And I mean, I'm almost being silly,\n\n25:36.740 --> 25:38.280\n but that's what we do.\n\n25:39.660 --> 25:40.940\n That's what we do with each other.\n\n25:40.940 --> 25:42.020\n This is the kind of,\n\n25:42.020 --> 25:44.500\n that consciousness is also a social construct.\n\n25:44.500 --> 25:47.860\n And a lot of our ideas of intelligence is a social construct.\n\n25:47.860 --> 25:52.820\n And so reaching that bar involves something that's beyond,\n\n25:52.820 --> 25:54.940\n that doesn't necessarily involve\n\n25:54.940 --> 25:57.720\n the fundamental understanding of how you go\n\n25:57.720 --> 26:02.500\n from electrons to neurons to cognition.\n\n26:02.500 --> 26:05.060\n No, actually, I think that is an extremely good point.\n\n26:05.060 --> 26:08.660\n And in fact, what it suggests is,\n\n26:08.660 --> 26:10.540\n so yeah, you referred to Kate Darling,\n\n26:10.540 --> 26:11.940\n who I had on the podcast,\n\n26:11.940 --> 26:16.440\n and who does these experiments with very simple robots,\n\n26:16.440 --> 26:18.060\n but they look like animals,\n\n26:18.060 --> 26:20.740\n and they can look like they're experiencing pain,\n\n26:20.740 --> 26:23.380\n and we human beings react very negatively\n\n26:23.380 --> 26:24.400\n to these little robots\n\n26:24.400 --> 26:26.300\n looking like they're experiencing pain.\n\n26:26.300 --> 26:29.980\n And what you wanna say is, yeah, but they're just robots.\n\n26:29.980 --> 26:31.700\n It's not really pain, right?\n\n26:31.700 --> 26:33.080\n It's just some electrons going around.\n\n26:33.080 --> 26:36.300\n But then you realize, you and I are just electrons\n\n26:36.300 --> 26:38.380\n going around, and that's what pain is also.\n\n26:38.380 --> 26:43.060\n And so what I would have an easy time imagining\n\n26:43.060 --> 26:44.740\n is that there is a spectrum\n\n26:44.740 --> 26:47.420\n between these simple little robots that Kate works with\n\n26:47.420 --> 26:49.420\n and a human being,\n\n26:49.420 --> 26:50.940\n where there are things that sort of\n\n26:50.940 --> 26:52.840\n by some strict definition,\n\n26:52.840 --> 26:55.460\n Turing test level thing are not conscious,\n\n26:55.460 --> 26:58.580\n but nevertheless walk and talk like they're conscious.\n\n26:58.580 --> 27:00.220\n And it could be that the future is,\n\n27:00.220 --> 27:02.460\n I mean, Siri is close, right?\n\n27:02.460 --> 27:04.540\n And so it might be the future\n\n27:04.540 --> 27:07.100\n has a lot more agents like that.\n\n27:07.100 --> 27:08.860\n And in fact, rather than someday going,\n\n27:08.860 --> 27:10.700\n aha, we have consciousness,\n\n27:10.700 --> 27:13.180\n we'll just creep up on it with more and more\n\n27:13.180 --> 27:15.220\n accurate reflections of what we expect.\n\n27:15.220 --> 27:18.320\n And in the future, maybe the present,\n\n27:18.320 --> 27:20.800\n for example, we haven't met before,\n\n27:20.800 --> 27:25.300\n and you're basically assuming that I'm human as it's a high\n\n27:25.300 --> 27:28.560\n probability at this time because the yeah,\n\n27:28.560 --> 27:30.200\n but in the future,\n\n27:30.200 --> 27:32.000\n there might be question marks around that, right?\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:33.340\n Yeah, no, absolutely.\n\n27:33.340 --> 27:35.740\n Certainly videos are almost to the point\n\n27:35.740 --> 27:36.740\n where you shouldn't trust them already.\n\n27:36.740 --> 27:39.060\n Photos you can't trust, right?\n\n27:39.060 --> 27:41.700\n Videos is easier to trust,\n\n27:41.700 --> 27:44.020\n but we're getting worse that,\n\n27:44.020 --> 27:46.540\n we're getting better at faking them, right?\n\n27:46.540 --> 27:48.780\n Yeah, so physical embodied people,\n\n27:48.780 --> 27:51.020\n what's so hard about faking that?\n\n27:51.020 --> 27:51.980\n So this is very depressing,\n\n27:51.980 --> 27:53.420\n this conversation we're having right now.\n\n27:53.420 --> 27:54.340\n So I mean,\n\n27:54.340 --> 27:55.180\n To me, it's exciting.\n\n27:55.180 --> 27:56.300\n To me, you're doing it.\n\n27:56.300 --> 27:57.780\n So it's exciting to you,\n\n27:57.780 --> 27:59.060\n but it's a sobering thought.\n\n27:59.060 --> 28:00.420\n We're very bad, right?\n\n28:00.420 --> 28:02.820\n At imagining what the next 50 years are gonna be like\n\n28:02.820 --> 28:04.220\n when we're in the middle of a phase transition\n\n28:04.220 --> 28:05.260\n as we are right now.\n\n28:05.260 --> 28:06.740\n Yeah, and I, in general,\n\n28:06.740 --> 28:09.220\n I'm not blind to all the threats.\n\n28:09.220 --> 28:14.220\n I am excited by the power of technology to solve,\n\n28:14.540 --> 28:18.060\n to protect us against the threats as they evolve.\n\n28:18.060 --> 28:22.340\n I'm not as much as Steven Pinker optimistic about the world,\n\n28:22.340 --> 28:23.740\n but in everything I've seen,\n\n28:23.740 --> 28:27.300\n all of the brilliant people in the world that I've met\n\n28:27.300 --> 28:29.160\n are good people.\n\n28:29.160 --> 28:30.800\n So the army of the good\n\n28:30.800 --> 28:33.400\n in terms of the development of technology is large.\n\n28:33.400 --> 28:36.860\n Okay, you're way more optimistic than I am.\n\n28:37.820 --> 28:39.060\n I think that goodness and badness\n\n28:39.060 --> 28:40.900\n are equally distributed among intelligent\n\n28:40.900 --> 28:42.700\n and unintelligent people.\n\n28:42.700 --> 28:44.660\n I don't see much of a correlation there.\n\n28:44.660 --> 28:46.060\n Interesting.\n\n28:46.060 --> 28:47.300\n Neither of us have proof.\n\n28:47.300 --> 28:48.420\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n28:48.420 --> 28:50.660\n Again, opinions are free, right?\n\n28:50.660 --> 28:52.540\n Nor definitions of good and evil.\n\n28:52.540 --> 28:57.460\n We come without definitions or without data opinions.\n\n28:57.460 --> 29:01.980\n So what kind of questions can science not currently answer\n\n29:01.980 --> 29:04.380\n and may never be able to answer in your view?\n\n29:04.380 --> 29:06.940\n Well, the obvious one is what is good and bad?\n\n29:06.940 --> 29:07.860\n What is right and wrong?\n\n29:07.860 --> 29:09.460\n I think that there are questions that,\n\n29:09.460 --> 29:11.300\n science tells us what happens,\n\n29:11.300 --> 29:13.260\n what the world is and what it does.\n\n29:13.260 --> 29:14.740\n It doesn't say what the world should do\n\n29:14.740 --> 29:15.580\n or what we should do,\n\n29:15.580 --> 29:17.800\n because we're part of the world.\n\n29:17.800 --> 29:19.200\n But we are part of the world\n\n29:19.200 --> 29:21.460\n and we have the ability to feel like something's right,\n\n29:21.460 --> 29:22.740\n something's wrong.\n\n29:22.740 --> 29:25.660\n And to make a very long story very short,\n\n29:25.660 --> 29:28.000\n I think that the idea of moral philosophy\n\n29:28.000 --> 29:30.100\n is systematizing our intuitions\n\n29:30.100 --> 29:31.700\n of what is right and what is wrong.\n\n29:31.700 --> 29:34.580\n And science might be able to predict ahead of time\n\n29:34.580 --> 29:36.180\n what we will do,\n\n29:36.180 --> 29:38.000\n but it won't ever be able to judge\n\n29:38.000 --> 29:39.600\n whether we should have done it or not.\n\n29:39.600 --> 29:43.620\n So, you're kind of unique in terms of scientists.\n\n29:43.620 --> 29:45.520\n Listen, it doesn't have to do with podcasts,\n\n29:45.520 --> 29:47.660\n but even just reaching out,\n\n29:47.660 --> 29:49.080\n I think you referred to as sort of\n\n29:49.080 --> 29:51.300\n doing interdisciplinary science.\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:54.100\n So you reach out and talk to people\n\n29:54.100 --> 29:55.980\n that are outside of your discipline,\n\n29:55.980 --> 30:00.140\n which I always hope that's what science was for.\n\n30:00.140 --> 30:02.300\n In fact, I was a little disillusioned\n\n30:02.300 --> 30:06.420\n when I realized that academia is very siloed.\n\n30:06.420 --> 30:07.260\n Yeah.\n\n30:07.260 --> 30:09.560\n And so the question is,\n\n30:10.700 --> 30:13.020\n how, at your own level,\n\n30:13.020 --> 30:15.380\n how do you prepare for these conversations?\n\n30:15.380 --> 30:16.900\n How do you think about these conversations?\n\n30:16.900 --> 30:18.300\n How do you open your mind enough\n\n30:18.300 --> 30:20.220\n to have these conversations?\n\n30:20.220 --> 30:21.940\n And it may be a little bit broader,\n\n30:21.940 --> 30:24.380\n how can you advise other scientists\n\n30:24.380 --> 30:26.260\n to have these kinds of conversations?\n\n30:26.260 --> 30:28.180\n Not at the podcast,\n\n30:28.180 --> 30:29.860\n the fact that you're doing a podcast is awesome,\n\n30:29.860 --> 30:31.380\n other people get to hear them,\n\n30:31.380 --> 30:34.700\n but it's also good to have it without mics in general.\n\n30:34.700 --> 30:37.460\n It's a good question, but a tough one to answer.\n\n30:37.460 --> 30:40.980\n I think about a guy I know who's a personal trainer,\n\n30:40.980 --> 30:43.240\n and he was asked on a podcast,\n\n30:43.240 --> 30:45.700\n how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout?\n\n30:45.700 --> 30:48.340\n How do we make that discipline to go and work out?\n\n30:48.340 --> 30:50.300\n And he's like, why are you asking me?\n\n30:50.300 --> 30:52.340\n I can't stop working out.\n\n30:52.340 --> 30:54.380\n I don't need to psych myself up.\n\n30:54.380 --> 30:57.340\n So, and likewise, he asked me,\n\n30:57.340 --> 30:59.740\n how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversations\n\n30:59.740 --> 31:00.700\n on all sorts of different things,\n\n31:00.700 --> 31:01.660\n all sorts of different people?\n\n31:01.660 --> 31:04.860\n I'm like, that's what makes me go, right?\n\n31:04.860 --> 31:07.380\n Like that's, I couldn't stop doing that.\n\n31:07.380 --> 31:09.660\n I did that long before any of them were recorded.\n\n31:09.660 --> 31:12.380\n In fact, a lot of the motivation for starting recording it\n\n31:12.380 --> 31:14.420\n was making sure I would read all these books\n\n31:14.420 --> 31:15.460\n that I had purchased, right?\n\n31:15.460 --> 31:17.700\n Like all these books I wanted to read,\n\n31:17.700 --> 31:18.900\n not enough time to read them.\n\n31:18.900 --> 31:20.700\n And now if I have the motivation,\n\n31:20.700 --> 31:23.220\n cause I'm gonna interview Pat Churchland,\n\n31:23.220 --> 31:25.180\n I'm gonna finally read her book.\n\n31:25.180 --> 31:29.460\n You know, and it's absolutely true\n\n31:29.460 --> 31:31.700\n that academia is extraordinarily siloed, right?\n\n31:31.700 --> 31:32.780\n We don't talk to people.\n\n31:32.780 --> 31:34.260\n We rarely do.\n\n31:34.260 --> 31:36.460\n And in fact, when we do, it's punished.\n\n31:36.460 --> 31:38.820\n You know, like the people who do it successfully\n\n31:38.820 --> 31:41.420\n generally first became very successful\n\n31:41.420 --> 31:43.100\n within their little siloed discipline.\n\n31:43.100 --> 31:46.380\n And only then did they start expanding out.\n\n31:46.380 --> 31:47.660\n If you're a young person, you know,\n\n31:47.660 --> 31:48.940\n I have graduate students.\n\n31:48.940 --> 31:52.980\n I try to be very, very candid with them about this,\n\n31:52.980 --> 31:55.580\n that it's, you know, most graduate students\n\n31:55.580 --> 31:57.420\n are to not become faculty members, right?\n\n31:57.420 --> 31:59.020\n It's a tough road.\n\n31:59.020 --> 32:03.140\n And so live the life you wanna live,\n\n32:03.140 --> 32:04.620\n but do it with your eyes open\n\n32:04.620 --> 32:06.900\n about what it does to your job chances.\n\n32:06.900 --> 32:09.580\n And the more broad you are\n\n32:09.580 --> 32:12.900\n and the less time you spend hyper specializing\n\n32:12.900 --> 32:15.780\n in your field, the lower your job chances are.\n\n32:15.780 --> 32:17.060\n That's just an academic reality.\n\n32:17.060 --> 32:20.060\n It's terrible, I don't like it, but it's a reality.\n\n32:20.060 --> 32:22.540\n And for some people, that's fine.\n\n32:22.540 --> 32:24.660\n Like there's plenty of people who are wonderful scientists\n\n32:24.660 --> 32:27.140\n who have zero interest in branching out\n\n32:27.140 --> 32:30.740\n and talking to things, to anyone outside their field.\n\n32:30.740 --> 32:33.740\n But it is disillusioning to me.\n\n32:33.740 --> 32:36.180\n Some of the, you know, romantic notion I had\n\n32:36.180 --> 32:38.220\n of the intellectual academic life\n\n32:38.220 --> 32:39.940\n is belied by the reality of it.\n\n32:39.940 --> 32:43.500\n The idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline\n\n32:43.500 --> 32:48.500\n and that is a positive good is just so rare\n\n32:48.500 --> 32:53.500\n in universities that it may as well not exist at all.\n\n32:53.900 --> 32:57.660\n But that said, even though you're saying you're doing it\n\n32:57.660 --> 33:00.300\n like the personal trainer, because you just can't help it,\n\n33:00.300 --> 33:02.940\n you're also an inspiration to others.\n\n33:02.940 --> 33:04.980\n Like I could speak for myself.\n\n33:05.780 --> 33:09.540\n You know, I also have a career I'm thinking about, right?\n\n33:09.540 --> 33:12.060\n And without your podcast,\n\n33:12.060 --> 33:15.060\n I may have not have been doing this at all, right?\n\n33:15.060 --> 33:19.540\n So it makes me realize that these kinds of conversations\n\n33:19.540 --> 33:23.340\n is kind of what science is about in many ways.\n\n33:23.340 --> 33:26.500\n The reason we write papers, this exchange of ideas,\n\n33:27.460 --> 33:30.540\n is it's much harder to do interdisciplinary papers,\n\n33:30.540 --> 33:31.380\n I would say.\n\n33:31.380 --> 33:35.140\n And conversations are easier.\n\n33:35.140 --> 33:36.820\n So conversations is the beginning.\n\n33:36.820 --> 33:41.180\n And in the field of AI, it's obvious\n\n33:41.180 --> 33:45.580\n that we should think outside of pure computer vision\n\n33:45.580 --> 33:47.540\n competitions on a particular data sets.\n\n33:47.540 --> 33:49.660\n We should think about the broader impact\n\n33:49.660 --> 33:53.740\n of how this can be, you know, reaching out to physics,\n\n33:53.740 --> 33:57.220\n to psychology, to neuroscience and having these\n\n33:57.220 --> 34:00.580\n conversations so that you're an inspiration.\n\n34:00.580 --> 34:05.220\n And so never know how the world changes.\n\n34:05.220 --> 34:08.540\n I mean, the fact that this stuff is out there\n\n34:08.540 --> 34:12.300\n and I've a huge number of people come up to me,\n\n34:12.300 --> 34:16.100\n grad students, really loving the podcast, inspired by it.\n\n34:16.100 --> 34:18.660\n And they will probably have that,\n\n34:18.660 --> 34:20.740\n they'll be ripple effects when they become faculty\n\n34:20.740 --> 34:21.580\n and so on and so on.\n\n34:21.580 --> 34:25.300\n We can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism.\n\n34:25.300 --> 34:27.780\n And Sean, thank you so much for talking to me, it was awesome.\n\n34:27.780 --> 34:29.460\n No, Lex, thank you very much for this conversation.\n\n34:29.460 --> 34:49.460\n It was great.\n\n"
