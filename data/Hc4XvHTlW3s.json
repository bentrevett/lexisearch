00:08.680\n and psychology at Berkeley, author of Why We Sleep,\n\n00:08.680 --> 00:13.680\n and the host of a new podcast called The Matt Walker Podcast.\n\n00:14.240 --> 00:17.140\n It's 10 minute episodes a couple of times a month,\n\n00:17.140 --> 00:20.760\n covering sleep and other health and science topics.\n\n00:20.760 --> 00:22.560\n I love it and recommend it highly.\n\n00:22.560 --> 00:24.400\n It's up there with the greats,\n\n00:24.400 --> 00:28.080\n like the Huberman Lab Podcast with Andrew Huberman,\n\n00:28.080 --> 00:30.600\n and I think David Sinclair is putting out\n\n00:30.600 --> 00:32.320\n an audio series soon too.\n\n00:32.320 --> 00:33.760\n I can't wait to listen to it.\n\n00:33.760 --> 00:36.800\n I'm really excited by the future of science\n\n00:36.800 --> 00:38.680\n in the podcasting world.\n\n00:38.680 --> 00:41.680\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors,\n\n00:41.680 --> 00:45.280\n Stamps.com, Squarespace, Athletic Greens,\n\n00:45.280 --> 00:47.160\n BetterHelp, and Onnit.\n\n00:47.160 --> 00:49.840\n Their links are in the description.\n\n00:49.840 --> 00:52.240\n As a side note, let me say that to me,\n\n00:52.240 --> 00:55.120\n a healthy life is one in which you fall in love\n\n00:55.120 --> 00:58.640\n with the world around you, with ideas, with people,\n\n00:58.640 --> 01:02.080\n with small goals and big goals, no matter how difficult,\n\n01:02.080 --> 01:05.880\n with dreams you hold onto and chase for years.\n\n01:05.880 --> 01:07.940\n Life should be lived fully.\n\n01:07.940 --> 01:10.000\n That, to me, is the priority.\n\n01:10.000 --> 01:12.080\n That, to me, is a healthy life.\n\n01:12.080 --> 01:15.520\n Second to that is the understanding and the utilization\n\n01:15.520 --> 01:18.600\n of the best available science on diet, exercise,\n\n01:18.600 --> 01:22.740\n supplements, sleep, and other lifestyle choices.\n\n01:22.740 --> 01:26.520\n To me, science in the realm of health is a guide\n\n01:26.520 --> 01:28.960\n for what we should try, not the absolute truth\n\n01:28.960 --> 01:30.960\n of how to live life.\n\n01:30.960 --> 01:33.040\n The goal is to learn to listen to your body\n\n01:33.040 --> 01:35.800\n and figure out what works best for you.\n\n01:35.800 --> 01:39.480\n All that said, a good night's sleep can be a great tool\n\n01:39.480 --> 01:41.720\n in making life awesome and productive,\n\n01:41.720 --> 01:46.720\n and Matt is a great advocate of the how and the why of sleep.\n\n01:46.960 --> 01:49.760\n We agree on some things and disagree on others,\n\n01:49.760 --> 01:52.440\n but he's a great human being, a great scientist,\n\n01:52.440 --> 01:55.480\n and, as of recently, a friend with whom I enjoy\n\n01:55.480 --> 01:58.680\n having these wide ranging conversations.\n\n01:58.680 --> 02:00.840\n This is the Lux Friedman podcast,\n\n02:00.840 --> 02:04.160\n and here is my conversation with Matt Walker.\n\n02:05.080 --> 02:06.480\n You should try these shades on.\n\n02:06.480 --> 02:07.880\n Let's see what you look like.\n\n02:11.160 --> 02:14.720\n So they are now your shades, and that's not the question.\n\n02:14.720 --> 02:17.680\n It's the same thing as Putin took the Super Bowl ring,\n\n02:17.680 --> 02:18.860\n and it's now his ring.\n\n02:18.860 --> 02:22.620\n Yeah, one wonders if he was offered it,\n\n02:22.620 --> 02:24.200\n but they are yours.\n\n02:26.380 --> 02:31.380\n When did you first fall in love with the dream\n\n02:31.500 --> 02:32.820\n of understanding sleep?\n\n02:32.820 --> 02:36.320\n Like, where did the fascination with sleep begin?\n\n02:38.420 --> 02:41.060\n So back in the United Kingdom,\n\n02:41.060 --> 02:44.060\n you can sort of start doing medicine at age 18,\n\n02:44.060 --> 02:46.020\n and it's a five year program,\n\n02:46.020 --> 02:50.620\n and I was at the Queen's Medical Center in the UK,\n\n02:50.620 --> 02:52.740\n and I remember just being fascinated\n\n02:52.740 --> 02:57.180\n by states of consciousness, and particularly anesthesia.\n\n02:57.180 --> 03:00.220\n I was thinking, isn't that, within seconds,\n\n03:00.220 --> 03:03.300\n I can take a perfectly conscious human being,\n\n03:03.300 --> 03:07.540\n and I can remove all existence of the mentality\n\n03:07.540 --> 03:09.820\n and their awareness within seconds,\n\n03:10.700 --> 03:12.500\n and that stunned me.\n\n03:12.500 --> 03:15.500\n So I started to get really interested in conscious states.\n\n03:15.500 --> 03:18.020\n I even started to read a lot about hypnosis,\n\n03:19.700 --> 03:22.280\n and all of these things, hypnosis,\n\n03:22.280 --> 03:24.340\n even sleep and dreams at the time,\n\n03:24.340 --> 03:25.940\n they were very esoteric.\n\n03:25.940 --> 03:29.720\n It was sort of charlatan science at that stage,\n\n03:29.720 --> 03:33.660\n and I think almost all of my colleagues and I\n\n03:33.660 --> 03:36.660\n are accidental sleep researchers.\n\n03:36.660 --> 03:38.980\n No one, as I recall, in the classroom\n\n03:38.980 --> 03:40.340\n when you're sort of five years old,\n\n03:40.340 --> 03:41.340\n and the teacher says,\n\n03:41.340 --> 03:44.020\n what would you like to be when you grow up?\n\n03:44.020 --> 03:45.340\n No one's putting their hand up and saying,\n\n03:45.340 --> 03:48.540\n I would love to be a sleep researcher.\n\n03:48.540 --> 03:51.500\n And so when I was doing my PhD,\n\n03:51.500 --> 03:55.060\n I was trying to identify different forms of dementia\n\n03:55.060 --> 03:57.500\n very early on in the course,\n\n03:57.500 --> 04:00.660\n and I was using electrical brainwave recordings to do that,\n\n04:00.660 --> 04:02.620\n and I was failing miserably.\n\n04:02.620 --> 04:07.260\n It was a disaster, just no result after no result.\n\n04:07.260 --> 04:09.220\n And I used to go home to the doctor's residence\n\n04:09.220 --> 04:11.260\n with this sort of little igloo of journals\n\n04:11.260 --> 04:15.060\n that at the weekend I would sort of sit in and read,\n\n04:15.060 --> 04:16.940\n and which I'm now thinking,\n\n04:16.940 --> 04:18.140\n do I really want to admit this?\n\n04:18.140 --> 04:19.780\n Because it sounds like I had no social life,\n\n04:19.780 --> 04:21.900\n which I didn't, I was a social leper.\n\n04:21.900 --> 04:26.260\n But, and I started to realize that some parts of the brain\n\n04:26.260 --> 04:29.020\n were sleep related areas,\n\n04:29.020 --> 04:31.540\n and some dementias were eating away\n\n04:31.540 --> 04:33.660\n those sleep related areas.\n\n04:33.660 --> 04:35.780\n Other dementias would leave them untouched.\n\n04:35.780 --> 04:38.060\n And I thought, well, I'm doing this all wrong.\n\n04:38.060 --> 04:41.260\n I'm measuring my patients while they're awake.\n\n04:41.260 --> 04:43.980\n Instead, I should be measuring them while they're asleep.\n\n04:43.980 --> 04:47.500\n Started doing that, got some amazing results.\n\n04:47.500 --> 04:49.700\n And then I wanted to ask the question,\n\n04:49.700 --> 04:54.100\n is that sleep disruption that my patients are experiencing\n\n04:54.100 --> 04:55.700\n as they go into dementia,\n\n04:55.700 --> 04:57.900\n maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia.\n\n04:57.900 --> 05:01.940\n I wonder if it's a cause of the dementia.\n\n05:01.940 --> 05:06.060\n And at that point, which was, cough, cough, 20 years ago,\n\n05:07.820 --> 05:11.060\n no one could answer a very simple fundamental question.\n\n05:11.060 --> 05:12.020\n Why do we sleep?\n\n05:12.020 --> 05:17.020\n And I at the time didn't realize\n\n05:17.020 --> 05:19.820\n that some of the most brilliant minds in scientific history\n\n05:19.820 --> 05:22.580\n had tried to answer that question and failed.\n\n05:22.580 --> 05:24.540\n And at that point, I just thought, well,\n\n05:24.540 --> 05:27.660\n I'm going to go and do a couple of years of sleep research\n\n05:27.660 --> 05:30.220\n and I'll figure out why we sleep.\n\n05:30.220 --> 05:31.700\n And then I'll come back to my patients\n\n05:31.700 --> 05:33.700\n in this question of dementia.\n\n05:33.700 --> 05:35.420\n And as I said, that was 20 years ago.\n\n05:35.420 --> 05:38.620\n And what I realized is that hard questions\n\n05:38.620 --> 05:41.460\n care very little about who asks them.\n\n05:41.460 --> 05:44.060\n They will meter out their lessons of difficulty\n\n05:44.060 --> 05:45.180\n all the same.\n\n05:45.180 --> 05:48.860\n And I was schooled in the difficulty of the question,\n\n05:48.860 --> 05:50.540\n why do we sleep?\n\n05:50.540 --> 05:53.020\n But in truth, 20 years later,\n\n05:53.020 --> 05:55.300\n we've had to upend the question\n\n05:55.300 --> 05:57.260\n rather than saying, why do we sleep?\n\n05:57.260 --> 05:59.980\n And by the way, the answer then was\n\n05:59.980 --> 06:02.140\n that we sleep to cure sleepiness,\n\n06:03.580 --> 06:07.060\n which is like saying, we eat to cure hunger.\n\n06:07.060 --> 06:09.380\n That tells you nothing about the physiological benefits\n\n06:09.380 --> 06:11.580\n of food, same with sleep.\n\n06:11.580 --> 06:14.300\n Now we've actually have to ask the question,\n\n06:14.300 --> 06:17.100\n is there any physiological system in the body\n\n06:17.100 --> 06:19.340\n or any major operation of the mind\n\n06:19.340 --> 06:22.380\n that isn't wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep\n\n06:22.380 --> 06:25.580\n or demonstrably impaired when we don't get enough?\n\n06:25.580 --> 06:28.900\n And so far, for the most part, the answer seems to be no.\n\n06:29.940 --> 06:32.940\n So far, the answer seems to be no.\n\n06:32.940 --> 06:37.940\n So why does the body and the mind crave sleep?\n\n06:37.940 --> 06:39.700\n Crave sleep then?\n\n06:39.700 --> 06:41.140\n Why do we sleep?\n\n06:41.140 --> 06:45.780\n How can we begin to answer that question then?\n\n06:45.780 --> 06:48.220\n So I think one of the ways that I think about this\n\n06:48.220 --> 06:53.060\n or one of the answers that came to me is the following.\n\n06:53.060 --> 06:55.460\n The reason that we implode so quickly\n\n06:55.460 --> 06:58.660\n and so thoroughly with insufficient sleep\n\n06:58.660 --> 07:01.780\n is because human beings seem to be one of the few species\n\n07:01.780 --> 07:04.020\n that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep\n\n07:04.020 --> 07:06.700\n for no apparent good reason, biological.\n\n07:06.700 --> 07:11.380\n And what that led me then to was the following.\n\n07:11.380 --> 07:13.580\n Mother nature as a consequence.\n\n07:13.580 --> 07:17.780\n So no other species does what we do in that context.\n\n07:17.780 --> 07:20.940\n There are a few species that do undergo sleep deprivation,\n\n07:20.940 --> 07:24.500\n but for very obvious, clear biological reasons.\n\n07:24.500 --> 07:27.620\n One is when they're in a condition of severe starvation.\n\n07:27.620 --> 07:30.900\n The second is when they're caring for their newborn.\n\n07:30.900 --> 07:34.180\n So for example, killer whales will often deprive themselves.\n\n07:34.180 --> 07:37.780\n The female will go away from the pod, give birth,\n\n07:37.780 --> 07:39.860\n and then bring the calf back.\n\n07:39.860 --> 07:41.260\n And during that time,\n\n07:41.260 --> 07:43.980\n the mother will undergo sleep deprivation.\n\n07:43.980 --> 07:46.580\n And then the third one is during migration\n\n07:46.580 --> 07:51.380\n when birds are flying trans oceanographic 2,000, 3,000 miles.\n\n07:51.380 --> 07:52.340\n But for the most part,\n\n07:52.340 --> 07:54.980\n it's never seen in the animal kingdom,\n\n07:54.980 --> 07:57.140\n which brings me back to the point,\n\n07:57.140 --> 08:00.900\n therefore mother nature in the course of evolution\n\n08:00.900 --> 08:03.540\n has never had to face the challenge of this thing\n\n08:03.540 --> 08:05.940\n called sleep deprivation.\n\n08:05.940 --> 08:11.300\n And therefore she has never created a safety net in place\n\n08:11.300 --> 08:15.300\n to circumnavigate this common influence.\n\n08:15.300 --> 08:18.420\n And there is a good example where we have,\n\n08:18.420 --> 08:22.300\n which is called the adipose cell, the fat cell.\n\n08:22.300 --> 08:24.420\n Because during our evolutionary past,\n\n08:24.420 --> 08:26.860\n we had famine and we had feast.\n\n08:26.860 --> 08:29.140\n And mother nature came up with a very clever recipe,\n\n08:29.140 --> 08:34.140\n which is how can I store caloric credit\n\n08:34.460 --> 08:37.220\n so that I can spend it when I go into debt?\n\n08:37.220 --> 08:39.620\n And the fat cell was born, brilliant idea.\n\n08:39.620 --> 08:42.020\n Where is the fat cell for sleep?\n\n08:42.020 --> 08:44.380\n Where is that sort of banking chip for sleep?\n\n08:44.380 --> 08:46.580\n And unfortunately we don't seem to have one\n\n08:46.580 --> 08:49.380\n because she's never had to face that challenge.\n\n08:49.380 --> 08:52.660\n So even if there's not some kind of physics,\n\n08:52.660 --> 08:55.300\n fundamental need for sleep\n\n08:55.300 --> 08:58.820\n that physiologically or psychologically,\n\n08:58.820 --> 09:03.820\n the fact is most organisms are built such that they need it.\n\n09:03.820 --> 09:08.060\n And then mother nature never built an extra mechanism\n\n09:08.060 --> 09:09.580\n for sleep deprivation.\n\n09:09.580 --> 09:12.180\n So it's interesting that why we sleep\n\n09:12.180 --> 09:13.620\n might not have a good answer,\n\n09:14.940 --> 09:19.460\n but we need to sleep to be healthy is nevertheless true.\n\n09:19.460 --> 09:21.700\n Yeah, and we have many answers right now.\n\n09:21.700 --> 09:23.940\n In some ways the question of why we sleep\n\n09:23.940 --> 09:25.940\n was the wrong question too.\n\n09:25.940 --> 09:30.220\n It's what are the plory potent many reasons we sleep?\n\n09:30.220 --> 09:32.500\n We don't just sleep for one reason\n\n09:32.500 --> 09:35.740\n because from an evolutionary perspective,\n\n09:35.740 --> 09:39.940\n it is the most idiotic thing that you could imagine.\n\n09:39.940 --> 09:42.980\n When you're sleeping, you're not finding a mate,\n\n09:42.980 --> 09:43.900\n you're not reproducing,\n\n09:43.900 --> 09:45.500\n you're not caring for your young,\n\n09:45.500 --> 09:47.420\n you're not foraging for food,\n\n09:47.420 --> 09:50.580\n and worse still, you're vulnerable to predation.\n\n09:50.580 --> 09:52.700\n So on any one of those grounds,\n\n09:52.700 --> 09:54.660\n especially as a collective,\n\n09:54.660 --> 09:57.860\n sleep should have been strongly selected against\n\n09:57.860 --> 09:59.780\n in the course of evolution.\n\n09:59.780 --> 10:03.900\n But in every species that we've studied carefully to date,\n\n10:03.900 --> 10:05.660\n sleep is present.\n\n10:05.660 --> 10:07.060\n Yeah, so it is important.\n\n10:07.060 --> 10:09.020\n So like you're right.\n\n10:09.020 --> 10:10.380\n I think I've heard arguments\n\n10:10.380 --> 10:12.260\n from an evolutionary biology perspective\n\n10:12.260 --> 10:15.780\n that sleep is actually advantageous,\n\n10:15.780 --> 10:18.580\n maybe like some kind of predator prey relationships.\n\n10:18.580 --> 10:19.860\n But you're saying,\n\n10:19.860 --> 10:22.500\n and it actually makes way more sense what you're saying\n\n10:22.500 --> 10:25.180\n is it should have been selected against.\n\n10:25.180 --> 10:27.300\n Like why close your eyes?\n\n10:27.300 --> 10:28.140\n Yeah, why?\n\n10:28.140 --> 10:31.900\n Because there was an energy conservation hypothesis\n\n10:31.900 --> 10:32.740\n for a while,\n\n10:32.740 --> 10:34.140\n which is that we need to essentially go\n\n10:34.140 --> 10:37.380\n into low battery mode, power down,\n\n10:37.380 --> 10:38.860\n because it's unsustainable.\n\n10:38.860 --> 10:41.900\n But in fact, that actually has been blasted out the water\n\n10:41.900 --> 10:45.660\n because sleep is an incredibly active process.\n\n10:45.660 --> 10:48.900\n In fact, the difference between you just lying on the couch\n\n10:48.900 --> 10:51.820\n but remaining conscious versus you lying on the couch\n\n10:51.820 --> 10:53.060\n and falling asleep,\n\n10:53.060 --> 10:56.660\n it's only a savings of about 140, 150 calories.\n\n10:56.660 --> 10:58.540\n In other words, you just go out\n\n10:58.540 --> 11:00.940\n and club another baby seal or whatever it was,\n\n11:00.940 --> 11:02.380\n and you wouldn't worry.\n\n11:02.380 --> 11:05.060\n So it has to be much more to it than energy conservation,\n\n11:05.060 --> 11:09.780\n much more to it than sharing ecosystem space and time,\n\n11:09.780 --> 11:13.620\n much more to it than simply predator prey relationships.\n\n11:13.620 --> 11:15.220\n If sleep really did,\n\n11:15.220 --> 11:17.260\n and looking back,\n\n11:17.260 --> 11:20.740\n even very old evolutionary organisms like earthworms,\n\n11:20.740 --> 11:22.100\n millions of years old,\n\n11:22.100 --> 11:24.740\n they have periods where they're active\n\n11:24.740 --> 11:26.500\n and periods where they're passively asleep.\n\n11:26.500 --> 11:27.820\n It's called lethargicus.\n\n11:28.700 --> 11:32.180\n And so what that in some ways suggested to me\n\n11:32.180 --> 11:36.660\n was sleep evolved with life itself on this planet,\n\n11:36.660 --> 11:39.660\n and then it has fought its way through heroically\n\n11:39.660 --> 11:42.620\n every step along the evolutionary pathway,\n\n11:42.620 --> 11:46.540\n which then leads to the sort of famous sleep statement\n\n11:46.540 --> 11:48.860\n from a researcher that if sleep doesn't serve\n\n11:48.860 --> 11:52.180\n an absolutely vital function or functions,\n\n11:52.180 --> 11:53.220\n then it's the biggest mistake\n\n11:53.220 --> 11:55.700\n the evolutionary process has ever made.\n\n11:55.700 --> 11:57.300\n And we've now realized Mother Nature\n\n11:57.300 --> 12:00.100\n didn't make a spectacular blender with sleep.\n\n12:00.100 --> 12:03.180\n You've mentioned the idea of conscious states.\n\n12:03.180 --> 12:04.940\n Do you think of sleep\n\n12:04.940 --> 12:08.940\n as a fundamentally different conscious state than awakeness?\n\n12:11.100 --> 12:13.340\n And how many conscious states are there\n\n12:13.340 --> 12:14.660\n so when you're into it,\n\n12:14.660 --> 12:17.380\n you're understanding of what the mind can do,\n\n12:17.380 --> 12:20.500\n do you think awake state, sleep state,\n\n12:20.500 --> 12:22.700\n or is there some kind of continuum?\n\n12:22.700 --> 12:26.220\n There's a complicated state transition diagram.\n\n12:26.220 --> 12:28.580\n Like how do you think about this whole space?\n\n12:28.580 --> 12:32.060\n I think about it as a state space diagram.\n\n12:32.060 --> 12:34.100\n And I think it's probably more of a continuum\n\n12:34.100 --> 12:37.700\n than we have believed it to be or suggested it to be.\n\n12:37.700 --> 12:41.420\n So we used to think absent of anesthesia\n\n12:41.420 --> 12:44.540\n that there were already three main states of consciousness.\n\n12:44.540 --> 12:48.860\n There was being awake, being in non rapid eye movement sleep\n\n12:48.860 --> 12:50.340\n or non dream sleep,\n\n12:50.340 --> 12:53.300\n and then being in rapid eye movement sleep or dream sleep.\n\n12:53.300 --> 12:55.220\n And those were the three states\n\n12:55.220 --> 13:00.340\n within which your brain could percolate and be conscious.\n\n13:00.340 --> 13:05.100\n Conscious during non REM sleep is maybe a stretch to say,\n\n13:05.100 --> 13:08.500\n but I still believe there is plenty of consciousness there.\n\n13:08.500 --> 13:11.420\n I don't believe that though anymore.\n\n13:11.420 --> 13:14.940\n And the reason is because we can have daydreams\n\n13:15.900 --> 13:20.140\n and we are in a very different wakeful state\n\n13:20.140 --> 13:23.420\n in those daydreams than we are when we are as we are now\n\n13:23.420 --> 13:27.180\n together present and extra septively focused\n\n13:27.180 --> 13:29.940\n rather than intra septively focused.\n\n13:30.940 --> 13:35.820\n And then we also know that as you are sort of progressing\n\n13:35.820 --> 13:38.820\n into those different stages of sleep during non REM sleep,\n\n13:38.820 --> 13:40.340\n you can also still dream,\n\n13:40.340 --> 13:42.340\n depends on your definition of dreaming,\n\n13:42.340 --> 13:44.860\n but we seem to have some degree of dreaming\n\n13:44.860 --> 13:47.540\n in almost all stages of sleep.\n\n13:48.540 --> 13:51.940\n We've also then found that when you are sleep deprived,\n\n13:51.940 --> 13:56.220\n there are even individual brain cells will fall asleep.\n\n13:56.220 --> 13:59.060\n Despite the animal being, you know,\n\n13:59.060 --> 14:02.420\n behaviorally from best we can tell awake,\n\n14:02.420 --> 14:05.060\n individual brain cells and clusters of brain cells\n\n14:05.060 --> 14:07.740\n will go into a sleep like state.\n\n14:07.740 --> 14:09.460\n And humans do this too.\n\n14:09.460 --> 14:10.940\n When we are sleep deprived,\n\n14:10.940 --> 14:13.580\n we have what are called microsleeps\n\n14:13.580 --> 14:17.180\n where the eyelid will partially close\n\n14:17.180 --> 14:20.540\n and the brain essentially falls lapses\n\n14:20.540 --> 14:23.060\n into a state of sleep,\n\n14:23.060 --> 14:25.300\n but behaviorally you seem to be awake.\n\n14:25.300 --> 14:28.820\n And the danger here is road traffic accidents.\n\n14:28.820 --> 14:30.820\n So these are the,\n\n14:30.820 --> 14:34.780\n what we call these sort of microsleep events at the wheel.\n\n14:34.780 --> 14:38.100\n Now, if you're traveling at 65 miles an hour\n\n14:38.100 --> 14:40.340\n in a two ton vehicle,\n\n14:40.340 --> 14:42.740\n you know, it takes probably around one second\n\n14:42.740 --> 14:44.340\n to drift from one lane to the next\n\n14:44.340 --> 14:48.140\n and it takes two seconds to go completely off the road.\n\n14:48.140 --> 14:50.620\n So if you have one of these microsleeps at the wheel,\n\n14:50.620 --> 14:52.540\n you know, it could be the last microsleep\n\n14:52.540 --> 14:53.500\n that you ever have.\n\n14:54.580 --> 14:57.460\n But I don't now see it as a set of,\n\n14:57.460 --> 15:00.220\n you know, very binary distinct,\n\n15:00.220 --> 15:02.260\n you know, step function state.\n\n15:02.260 --> 15:04.460\n It's not a one or a zero.\n\n15:04.460 --> 15:07.020\n I see it more of a, as a continuum.\n\n15:07.020 --> 15:12.020\n So I've for five, six years at MIT\n\n15:13.460 --> 15:17.740\n really focused on this human side of driving question.\n\n15:17.740 --> 15:22.740\n And one of the big concerns is the microsleeps,\n\n15:23.180 --> 15:25.340\n drowsiness, these kinds of ideas.\n\n15:25.340 --> 15:27.100\n And one of the open questions was,\n\n15:27.100 --> 15:29.940\n is it possible through computer vision to detect\n\n15:29.940 --> 15:32.340\n or any kind of sensors?\n\n15:32.340 --> 15:33.860\n The nice thing about computer vision\n\n15:33.860 --> 15:36.860\n is you don't have to have direct contact to the person.\n\n15:36.860 --> 15:41.740\n Is it possible to detect increases in drowsiness?\n\n15:41.740 --> 15:44.140\n Is it possible to detect these kinds of microsleeps\n\n15:44.140 --> 15:46.100\n or actually just sleep in general?\n\n15:47.260 --> 15:49.260\n Among other things, like distraction,\n\n15:49.260 --> 15:52.060\n these are all words that have so many meanings\n\n15:52.060 --> 15:55.900\n and so many debates, like attention is a whole nother one.\n\n15:55.900 --> 15:57.300\n Just because you're looking at something\n\n15:57.300 --> 16:00.180\n doesn't mean you're loading in the information.\n\n16:00.180 --> 16:02.260\n Just because you're looking away\n\n16:02.260 --> 16:03.780\n doesn't mean your peripheral vision\n\n16:03.780 --> 16:05.780\n can't pick up the important information.\n\n16:05.780 --> 16:08.860\n There's so many complicated vision science things there.\n\n16:08.860 --> 16:11.940\n So I wonder if you could say something to,\n\n16:13.140 --> 16:15.260\n they say the eyes are the windows to the soul.\n\n16:15.260 --> 16:19.140\n Do you think the eyes can reveal\n\n16:19.140 --> 16:24.140\n something about sleepiness through computer vision,\n\n16:25.700 --> 16:27.580\n just looking at the video of the face?\n\n16:27.580 --> 16:30.180\n And Andrew Huberman and I, your friend,\n\n16:30.180 --> 16:31.020\n have talked about this.\n\n16:31.020 --> 16:33.620\n I would love to work on this together.\n\n16:33.620 --> 16:35.620\n It's a fascinating problem.\n\n16:35.620 --> 16:37.180\n But drowsiness is a tricky one.\n\n16:37.180 --> 16:39.340\n So there's, what kind of information?\n\n16:39.340 --> 16:42.700\n There's blinking and there's eye movement.\n\n16:42.700 --> 16:46.020\n And those are the ones that can be picked up\n\n16:46.020 --> 16:46.860\n with computer vision.\n\n16:46.860 --> 16:48.980\n Do you think those are signals that could be used\n\n16:48.980 --> 16:52.660\n to say something about where we are in this continuum?\n\n16:52.660 --> 16:53.540\n Yeah, I do.\n\n16:53.540 --> 16:55.580\n And I think there are a number of other features too.\n\n16:55.580 --> 16:59.460\n I think, you know, aperture of eye.\n\n16:59.460 --> 17:03.100\n So in other words, partial closures, full closures,\n\n17:03.100 --> 17:06.460\n duration of those closures, duration of those partial\n\n17:06.460 --> 17:08.100\n closures of the eyelid.\n\n17:09.380 --> 17:13.380\n I think there may be some information in the pupil as well,\n\n17:13.380 --> 17:16.420\n because as we're transitioning between those states,\n\n17:16.420 --> 17:17.900\n there are changes in what's called\n\n17:17.900 --> 17:19.300\n the automatic nervous system,\n\n17:19.300 --> 17:22.780\n or technically it's called the autonomic nervous system,\n\n17:22.780 --> 17:27.060\n part of which will control your pupillary size.\n\n17:27.060 --> 17:29.820\n So I actually think that there is probably\n\n17:29.820 --> 17:32.300\n a wealth of information.\n\n17:32.300 --> 17:37.020\n When you combine that probably with aspects of steering,\n\n17:37.020 --> 17:38.940\n angle steering maneuver.\n\n17:39.860 --> 17:44.460\n And if you can sense the pressure on the pedals as well,\n\n17:44.460 --> 17:48.020\n my guess is that there is some combinatorial feature\n\n17:48.020 --> 17:52.020\n that creates a phenotype of,\n\n17:52.020 --> 17:54.260\n you are starting to fall asleep.\n\n17:54.260 --> 17:57.980\n And as the autonomous controls develop,\n\n17:57.980 --> 18:00.460\n that it's time for them to kick in.\n\n18:00.460 --> 18:03.460\n Some manufacturers, auto manufacturers sort of have\n\n18:03.460 --> 18:07.900\n something beta version, maybe an alpha version of this\n\n18:07.900 --> 18:09.420\n already starting to come online,\n\n18:09.420 --> 18:11.900\n where they have a little camera in the wheel\n\n18:11.900 --> 18:14.540\n that I think tries to look at some features.\n\n18:14.540 --> 18:17.700\n Almost everybody doing this and it's very alpha.\n\n18:19.940 --> 18:23.180\n So, you know, the thing that you currently have,\n\n18:23.180 --> 18:24.420\n some people have that in their car,\n\n18:24.420 --> 18:26.460\n there's a coffee cup or something that comes up\n\n18:26.460 --> 18:27.980\n that you might be sleepy.\n\n18:27.980 --> 18:31.580\n The primary signal that they're comfortable using\n\n18:31.580 --> 18:33.380\n is the steering wheel reversals.\n\n18:33.380 --> 18:37.460\n So basically using your interaction with the steering wheel\n\n18:37.460 --> 18:39.700\n and how much you're interacting with it\n\n18:39.700 --> 18:40.940\n as a sign of sleepiness.\n\n18:40.940 --> 18:43.620\n So if you have to constantly correct the car,\n\n18:43.620 --> 18:46.260\n that's a sign of like you starting to drift\n\n18:46.260 --> 18:47.380\n into microsleep.\n\n18:47.380 --> 18:49.540\n I think that's a very, very crude signal.\n\n18:49.540 --> 18:51.180\n It's probably a powerful one.\n\n18:51.180 --> 18:52.740\n There's a whole nother component to this,\n\n18:52.740 --> 18:57.740\n which is it seems like it's so driver and subject dependent.\n\n18:59.220 --> 19:04.220\n How our behavior changes as we get sleepy and drowsy\n\n19:04.220 --> 19:08.140\n seems to be different in complicated, fascinating ways\n\n19:08.140 --> 19:09.780\n where you can't just use one signal.\n\n19:09.780 --> 19:11.100\n It's kind of like what you're saying,\n\n19:11.100 --> 19:13.540\n there has to be a lot of different signals\n\n19:13.540 --> 19:15.380\n that you should then be able to combine.\n\n19:15.380 --> 19:19.780\n The hope is there's the searches for like universal signals\n\n19:19.780 --> 19:23.580\n that are pretty damn good for like 90% of people.\n\n19:23.580 --> 19:24.620\n But I don't think we need\n\n19:24.620 --> 19:27.220\n to take necessarily quite that approach.\n\n19:27.220 --> 19:31.100\n I think what we could do in some clever fashion\n\n19:31.100 --> 19:33.500\n is using the individual.\n\n19:33.500 --> 19:35.620\n So what you and I are perhaps suggesting here\n\n19:35.620 --> 19:38.420\n is that there is an array of features\n\n19:38.420 --> 19:40.860\n that we know provide information\n\n19:40.860 --> 19:42.780\n that is sensitive to whether or not\n\n19:42.780 --> 19:44.580\n you're falling asleep at the wheel.\n\n19:44.580 --> 19:47.940\n Some of those, let's say that there are 10 of them,\n\n19:47.940 --> 19:51.860\n for me, seven of them are the cardinal features.\n\n19:51.860 --> 19:54.580\n For you, however, you know, six of them\n\n19:54.580 --> 19:58.100\n and they're not all the same sort of overlapping\n\n19:58.100 --> 19:59.980\n are those for you.\n\n19:59.980 --> 20:01.900\n I think what we need is algorithms\n\n20:01.900 --> 20:04.500\n that can firstly understand when you are well slept.\n\n20:04.500 --> 20:06.980\n So let's say that people have sleep trackers at night\n\n20:06.980 --> 20:09.260\n and then your car integrates that information\n\n20:09.260 --> 20:12.660\n and it understands when you are well slept.\n\n20:12.660 --> 20:16.700\n And then you've got the data of the individual behavior\n\n20:16.700 --> 20:20.380\n unique to that individual, snowflake like,\n\n20:20.380 --> 20:21.940\n when they are well slept.\n\n20:21.940 --> 20:26.540\n This is the signature of well rested driving.\n\n20:26.540 --> 20:29.260\n Then you can look at deviations from that\n\n20:29.260 --> 20:32.260\n and pattern match it with the sleep history\n\n20:32.260 --> 20:33.700\n of that individual.\n\n20:33.700 --> 20:37.460\n And then I don't need to find the sort of, you know,\n\n20:37.460 --> 20:41.100\n the one size fits all approach for 99% of the people.\n\n20:41.100 --> 20:45.460\n I can create a very bespoke tailor like set of features,\n\n20:45.460 --> 20:49.580\n a Savile Row suit of sleepiness features.\n\n20:49.580 --> 20:50.540\n You know, that would be my,\n\n20:50.540 --> 20:53.540\n if you want to ask me about moon shots and crazy ideas,\n\n20:53.540 --> 20:54.380\n that's where I go.\n\n20:54.380 --> 20:58.180\n But to start with, I think your approach is a great one.\n\n20:58.180 --> 21:02.060\n Let's find something that covers 99% of the people\n\n21:02.060 --> 21:04.700\n because the worrying thing about microsleeps of course,\n\n21:04.700 --> 21:08.300\n unlike, you know, drugs or alcohol, which you know,\n\n21:08.300 --> 21:11.940\n certainly is a terrible thing to be behind the wheel.\n\n21:11.940 --> 21:16.940\n With those often you react too late.\n\n21:17.660 --> 21:20.180\n And that's the reason you get into an accident.\n\n21:20.180 --> 21:22.820\n When you fall asleep behind the wheel,\n\n21:22.820 --> 21:24.260\n you don't react at all.\n\n21:25.140 --> 21:26.220\n You know, at that point,\n\n21:26.220 --> 21:28.580\n there is a two ton missile driving down the street\n\n21:28.580 --> 21:29.940\n and no one's in control.\n\n21:29.940 --> 21:34.420\n That's why those accidents can often be more dangerous.\n\n21:34.420 --> 21:37.340\n Yeah, and the fascinating thing is,\n\n21:37.340 --> 21:39.420\n in the case of semi autonomous vehicles,\n\n21:39.420 --> 21:40.940\n like Tesla autopilot,\n\n21:40.940 --> 21:44.700\n this is where I've had disagreements with Mr. Elon Musk,\n\n21:46.980 --> 21:50.020\n and the human factors community,\n\n21:50.020 --> 21:53.700\n which is this community that one of the big things they study\n\n21:53.700 --> 21:56.780\n is human supervision over automation.\n\n21:56.780 --> 22:00.620\n So you have like pilots, you know, supervising an airplane\n\n22:00.620 --> 22:02.740\n that's mostly flying autonomously.\n\n22:02.740 --> 22:06.700\n The question is, when we're actually doing the driving,\n\n22:07.700 --> 22:09.860\n how do microsleeps or general,\n\n22:09.860 --> 22:12.100\n how does drowsiness progress\n\n22:12.100 --> 22:14.020\n and how does it affect our driving?\n\n22:14.020 --> 22:17.460\n That question becomes more fascinating, more complicated\n\n22:17.460 --> 22:19.540\n when your task is not driving,\n\n22:19.540 --> 22:21.660\n but supervising the driving.\n\n22:21.660 --> 22:24.780\n So your task is to take over when stuff goes wrong.\n\n22:24.780 --> 22:27.140\n And that is complicated,\n\n22:27.140 --> 22:30.260\n but the basic conclusions from many decades\n\n22:30.260 --> 22:34.300\n is that humans are really crappy at supervising\n\n22:34.300 --> 22:39.300\n because they get drowsy and lose vigilance much, much faster.\n\n22:39.300 --> 22:42.020\n The really surprising thing with Tesla autopilot,\n\n22:42.020 --> 22:44.260\n it was surprising to me,\n\n22:44.260 --> 22:46.780\n surprising to the human factors community,\n\n22:46.780 --> 22:49.100\n and in fact, they still argue with me about it,\n\n22:49.100 --> 22:54.100\n is it seems that humans in Teslas with autopilot\n\n22:55.020 --> 22:58.540\n and other similar systems are not becoming less vigilant,\n\n22:58.540 --> 23:01.380\n at least with the studies we've done.\n\n23:01.380 --> 23:05.100\n So there's something about the urgency of driving.\n\n23:05.100 --> 23:06.980\n I can't, I'm not sure why,\n\n23:06.980 --> 23:08.660\n but there's something about the risk,\n\n23:08.660 --> 23:10.580\n I think the fact that you might die\n\n23:11.620 --> 23:14.220\n is still keeping people awake.\n\n23:14.220 --> 23:16.300\n The question is, as Tesla autopilot\n\n23:16.300 --> 23:19.180\n or similar systems get better and better and better,\n\n23:19.180 --> 23:21.460\n how does that affect increasing drowsiness?\n\n23:21.460 --> 23:23.020\n And that's when you need to have,\n\n23:23.020 --> 23:25.180\n that's where the big disagreement was,\n\n23:25.180 --> 23:27.100\n you need to have driver sensing,\n\n23:27.100 --> 23:28.940\n meaning driver facing camera\n\n23:30.060 --> 23:33.460\n that tracks some kind of information about the face\n\n23:33.460 --> 23:35.860\n that can tell you drowsiness.\n\n23:35.860 --> 23:38.780\n So you can tell the car if you're drowsy\n\n23:38.780 --> 23:40.020\n so that the car can be like,\n\n23:40.020 --> 23:43.700\n you should be probably driving or pull to the side.\n\n23:43.700 --> 23:47.220\n Right, or I need to do some of the heavy lifting here.\n\n23:47.220 --> 23:50.500\n Yeah, so there needs to be that dance of interaction\n\n23:50.500 --> 23:53.460\n of a human and machine,\n\n23:53.460 --> 23:56.620\n but currently it's mostly steering wheel based.\n\n23:56.620 --> 23:59.980\n So this idea that your hands should be\n\n23:59.980 --> 24:02.180\n on the steering wheel,\n\n24:02.180 --> 24:05.660\n that's a sign that you're paying attention\n\n24:05.660 --> 24:09.420\n is an outdated and a very crude metric.\n\n24:09.420 --> 24:11.180\n I agree, yeah.\n\n24:11.180 --> 24:13.300\n I think there are far more sophisticated ways\n\n24:13.300 --> 24:16.380\n that we can solve that problem if we invest.\n\n24:17.220 --> 24:20.580\n Can I ask you a big philosophical question\n\n24:20.580 --> 24:22.940\n before we get into fun details?\n\n24:24.660 --> 24:26.540\n On the topic of conscious states,\n\n24:28.340 --> 24:31.180\n how fundamental do you think is consciousness\n\n24:31.180 --> 24:33.300\n to the human mind?\n\n24:33.300 --> 24:36.340\n I ask this from almost like a robotics perspective.\n\n24:36.340 --> 24:38.980\n So in your study of sleep,\n\n24:38.980 --> 24:42.020\n do you think the hard question of consciousness\n\n24:42.020 --> 24:45.340\n that it feels like something to be us,\n\n24:45.340 --> 24:46.820\n is that like a nice little feature,\n\n24:46.820 --> 24:50.180\n like a quirk of our mind,\n\n24:50.180 --> 24:51.940\n or is it somehow fundamental?\n\n24:51.940 --> 24:55.780\n Because sleep feels like we take a step out\n\n24:55.780 --> 24:57.780\n of that consciousness a little bit.\n\n24:57.780 --> 25:00.500\n So from all your study of sleep,\n\n25:00.500 --> 25:04.260\n do you think consciousness is like deeply part of who we are\n\n25:04.260 --> 25:05.780\n or is it just a nice trick?\n\n25:06.900 --> 25:09.580\n I think it's a deeply embedded feature\n\n25:09.580 --> 25:13.300\n that I can imagine has a whole panoply\n\n25:13.300 --> 25:16.060\n of biological benefits.\n\n25:16.060 --> 25:17.660\n But to your point about sleep,\n\n25:17.660 --> 25:20.860\n what is interesting if you do a lot of dream research\n\n25:20.860 --> 25:21.980\n and we've done some,\n\n25:23.340 --> 25:28.100\n it's very, very rare at all, in fact,\n\n25:28.100 --> 25:31.180\n for you to end up becoming someone\n\n25:31.180 --> 25:33.380\n other than who you are in your dreams.\n\n25:33.380 --> 25:35.900\n Now you can have third person perspective dreams\n\n25:35.900 --> 25:38.740\n where you can see yourself in the dream\n\n25:38.740 --> 25:40.540\n as if you're sort of,\n\n25:40.540 --> 25:44.940\n you've risen above your physical being.\n\n25:44.940 --> 25:46.180\n But for the most part,\n\n25:46.180 --> 25:51.180\n it's very rare that we lose our sense of conscious self.\n\n25:51.380 --> 25:53.660\n And maybe I'm sort of doing a sleight of hand\n\n25:53.660 --> 25:55.020\n because it's really what I'm saying,\n\n25:55.020 --> 25:56.580\n it's very rare that we lose our sense\n\n25:56.580 --> 25:58.660\n of who we are in dreams.\n\n25:58.660 --> 25:59.940\n We never do.\n\n25:59.940 --> 26:04.380\n Now that's not to suggest that dreams aren't utterly bizarre.\n\n26:04.380 --> 26:07.780\n And I mean, when you slept last night,\n\n26:07.780 --> 26:12.060\n which I know may have been perhaps a little less than me,\n\n26:12.060 --> 26:14.740\n but when you went into dreaming,\n\n26:14.740 --> 26:18.180\n you became flagrantly psychotic.\n\n26:18.180 --> 26:20.420\n And there are five essentially good reasons.\n\n26:20.420 --> 26:23.460\n Firstly, you started to see things which were not there,\n\n26:23.460 --> 26:25.180\n so you were hallucinating.\n\n26:25.180 --> 26:28.260\n Second, you believe things that couldn't possibly be true,\n\n26:28.260 --> 26:30.140\n so you were delusional.\n\n26:30.140 --> 26:35.140\n Third, you became confused about time and place and person,\n\n26:35.260 --> 26:38.540\n so you're suffering from what we would call disorientation.\n\n26:38.540 --> 26:41.620\n Fourth, you have wildly fluctuating emotions,\n\n26:41.620 --> 26:43.620\n something that psychiatrists\n\n26:43.620 --> 26:46.460\n will call being affectively labile.\n\n26:46.460 --> 26:48.540\n And then how wonderful, you woke up this morning\n\n26:48.540 --> 26:51.100\n and you forgot most if not all of that dream experience,\n\n26:51.100 --> 26:52.820\n so you're suffering from amnesia.\n\n26:52.820 --> 26:55.900\n If you were to experience any one of those five things\n\n26:55.900 --> 26:56.900\n while you're awake,\n\n26:56.900 --> 27:00.620\n you would probably be seeking psychological help.\n\n27:00.620 --> 27:03.940\n But so I place that as a backdrop\n\n27:03.940 --> 27:06.180\n against your astute question,\n\n27:06.180 --> 27:11.060\n because despite all of that psychosis,\n\n27:11.060 --> 27:16.060\n there is still a present self nested at the heart of it,\n\n27:16.180 --> 27:19.780\n meaning that I think it's very difficult for us\n\n27:19.780 --> 27:24.100\n to abandon our conscious sense of self.\n\n27:24.100 --> 27:25.900\n And if it's that hard,\n\n27:25.900 --> 27:27.180\n the old adage in some ways,\n\n27:27.180 --> 27:29.260\n that you can't outrun your shadow.\n\n27:29.260 --> 27:31.420\n But here it's more of a philosophical question,\n\n27:31.420 --> 27:33.660\n which is about the conscious mind\n\n27:33.660 --> 27:36.220\n and what the state of consciousness actually means\n\n27:36.220 --> 27:37.220\n in a human being.\n\n27:38.100 --> 27:39.580\n So I think that that to me,\n\n27:39.580 --> 27:44.580\n you become so dislocated from so many other rational ways\n\n27:45.860 --> 27:47.860\n of waking consciousness.\n\n27:47.860 --> 27:49.540\n But one thing that won't go away,\n\n27:49.540 --> 27:54.540\n that won't get perturbed or sort of, you know,\n\n27:54.660 --> 27:58.180\n manacled, is this your sense of conscious self?\n\n27:58.180 --> 28:00.140\n Yeah, that's a strong sign that consciousness\n\n28:00.140 --> 28:02.380\n is fundamental to the human mind.\n\n28:03.380 --> 28:04.900\n Or we're just creatures of habit\n\n28:04.900 --> 28:06.860\n who gotten used to having consciousness.\n\n28:06.860 --> 28:11.060\n Maybe it just takes a lot of either chemical substances\n\n28:11.060 --> 28:15.980\n or a lot of like mental work to escape that.\n\n28:15.980 --> 28:19.340\n I mean, it's like trying to launch a rocket.\n\n28:19.340 --> 28:22.060\n You know, the energy that has to be put in\n\n28:22.060 --> 28:24.580\n to create escape velocity\n\n28:24.580 --> 28:26.620\n from the gravitational pull of this thing\n\n28:26.620 --> 28:29.060\n called planet earth is immense.\n\n28:29.060 --> 28:31.140\n Well, the same thing is true\n\n28:31.140 --> 28:36.140\n for us to abandon our sense of conscious self.\n\n28:36.580 --> 28:39.380\n The amount of biological, the amount of substances,\n\n28:39.380 --> 28:42.020\n the amount of wacky stuff that you have to do\n\n28:42.020 --> 28:46.420\n to truly get escape velocity from your conscious self.\n\n28:46.420 --> 28:48.380\n What does that tell us about then\n\n28:48.380 --> 28:52.220\n the fundamental state of our conscious self?\n\n28:52.220 --> 28:55.540\n Yeah, it also probably says that it's quite useful\n\n28:55.540 --> 28:58.700\n to have consciousness for survival\n\n28:58.700 --> 29:01.420\n and for just operation in this world.\n\n29:01.420 --> 29:02.820\n And perhaps for intelligence.\n\n29:02.820 --> 29:05.020\n I'm one of the, on the AI side,\n\n29:05.020 --> 29:10.020\n people that think that intelligence requires consciousness.\n\n29:10.300 --> 29:12.980\n So like high levels of general intelligence\n\n29:12.980 --> 29:14.460\n requires consciousness.\n\n29:14.460 --> 29:17.700\n Most people in the AI field think like consciousness\n\n29:17.700 --> 29:19.580\n and intelligence are fundamentally different.\n\n29:19.580 --> 29:22.100\n You could build a computer that's super intelligent.\n\n29:22.100 --> 29:23.820\n It doesn't have to be conscious.\n\n29:23.820 --> 29:26.660\n I think that if you define super intelligence\n\n29:26.660 --> 29:28.580\n by being good at chess, yes.\n\n29:28.580 --> 29:30.820\n But if you define super intelligence\n\n29:30.820 --> 29:35.020\n as being able to operate in this living world of humans\n\n29:35.020 --> 29:37.540\n and be able to perform all kinds of different tasks,\n\n29:37.540 --> 29:41.020\n consciousness, it seems to be somehow fundamental\n\n29:41.860 --> 29:46.780\n to richly integrate yourself into the human experience,\n\n29:46.780 --> 29:48.300\n into society.\n\n29:48.300 --> 29:50.940\n It feels like you have to be a conscious being.\n\n29:50.940 --> 29:53.420\n But then we don't even know what consciousness is\n\n29:53.420 --> 29:55.620\n and we certainly don't know how to engineer it\n\n29:55.620 --> 29:56.660\n in our machines.\n\n29:56.660 --> 30:00.100\n I love the fact that there are still questions\n\n30:00.100 --> 30:03.220\n that are so embryonic because, you know,\n\n30:03.220 --> 30:05.620\n I suspect it's the same with you.\n\n30:05.620 --> 30:09.820\n Answers to me are simply ways to get to more questions.\n\n30:09.820 --> 30:12.140\n You know, it's questions where, you know,\n\n30:12.140 --> 30:15.020\n questions turn me on, answers less so.\n\n30:15.020 --> 30:18.820\n And I love the fact that we are still embryonic\n\n30:18.820 --> 30:20.940\n in our sense of arguing about\n\n30:20.940 --> 30:23.780\n even what the definition of consciousness is.\n\n30:23.780 --> 30:25.660\n But I also find it fascinating.\n\n30:25.660 --> 30:27.660\n I think it's thoroughly delightful\n\n30:27.660 --> 30:30.140\n to absorb yourself in the thought.\n\n30:30.140 --> 30:33.780\n Think about the brain and we can move back\n\n30:33.780 --> 30:35.940\n across the complexity of phylogeny\n\n30:35.940 --> 30:38.100\n from, you know, humans to mammals\n\n30:38.100 --> 30:41.980\n to sort of birds to reptiles, amphibians, fish.\n\n30:41.980 --> 30:44.900\n You can, bacteria, whatever you want.\n\n30:44.900 --> 30:46.700\n And you can go through this and say, okay,\n\n30:46.700 --> 30:48.700\n where is the hard line of, you know,\n\n30:48.700 --> 30:51.220\n what we would define as consciousness?\n\n30:51.220 --> 30:52.820\n And I'm sure it's got something to do\n\n30:52.820 --> 30:55.300\n with the complexity of the neural system.\n\n30:55.300 --> 30:57.540\n Of that, I'm fairly certain.\n\n30:57.540 --> 31:01.380\n But to me, it's always been fascinating.\n\n31:01.380 --> 31:02.500\n So what is it then?\n\n31:02.500 --> 31:04.620\n You know, is it that I just keep adding neurons\n\n31:04.620 --> 31:07.180\n to a Petri dish and I just keep adding them\n\n31:07.180 --> 31:08.260\n and adding them and adding them.\n\n31:08.260 --> 31:10.260\n At some point when I hit a critical mass\n\n31:10.260 --> 31:13.180\n of interconnected neurons, that is the mass of the,\n\n31:13.180 --> 31:16.220\n you know, the interconnected human brain, then bingo.\n\n31:17.620 --> 31:19.780\n All of a sudden it kicks into gear\n\n31:19.780 --> 31:21.300\n and we have consciousness.\n\n31:21.300 --> 31:23.540\n Like a phase shift, phase transition of some kind.\n\n31:23.540 --> 31:24.460\n Correct, yeah.\n\n31:24.460 --> 31:26.260\n But there is something about the complexity\n\n31:26.260 --> 31:27.940\n of the nervous system that I think\n\n31:27.940 --> 31:29.260\n is fundamental to consciousness.\n\n31:29.260 --> 31:31.420\n And the reason I bring that up is because\n\n31:31.420 --> 31:33.700\n when we're trying to then think about creating it\n\n31:33.700 --> 31:36.780\n in an artificial way, does that inform us\n\n31:36.780 --> 31:39.220\n as to the complexity that we should be looking at\n\n31:39.220 --> 31:41.300\n in terms of development?\n\n31:41.300 --> 31:44.420\n I also think that it's a missed opportunity\n\n31:44.420 --> 31:48.620\n in the sort of digital space for us\n\n31:48.620 --> 31:51.380\n to try to recreate human consciousness.\n\n31:52.260 --> 31:54.700\n We've already got human consciousness.\n\n31:54.700 --> 31:57.460\n What if we were to think about creating\n\n31:57.460 --> 31:59.900\n some other form of, why do we have to think\n\n31:59.900 --> 32:03.620\n that the ultimate in the creation of, you know,\n\n32:03.620 --> 32:07.380\n an artificial intelligence is the replication,\n\n32:07.380 --> 32:11.900\n you know, of a human state of consciousness?\n\n32:11.900 --> 32:16.660\n Can we not think outside of our own consciousness\n\n32:16.660 --> 32:19.340\n and believe that there is something even more incredible\n\n32:19.340 --> 32:22.380\n or more complimentary, more orthogonal?\n\n32:24.220 --> 32:28.420\n So I'm sometimes perplexed that people\n\n32:28.420 --> 32:30.540\n are trying to mimic human consciousness\n\n32:30.540 --> 32:33.180\n rather than think about creating\n\n32:33.180 --> 32:34.980\n something that's different.\n\n32:34.980 --> 32:37.780\n I think of human consciousness or consciousness in general\n\n32:37.780 --> 32:42.780\n as this magic superpower that allows us\n\n32:42.820 --> 32:44.740\n to deeply experience the world.\n\n32:44.740 --> 32:47.260\n And just as you're saying, I don't think that superpower\n\n32:47.260 --> 32:49.780\n has to take the exact flavor as humans have.\n\n32:49.780 --> 32:51.860\n That's my love for robots.\n\n32:51.860 --> 32:56.180\n I would love to add the ability to robots\n\n32:56.180 --> 33:00.460\n that can experience the world and other humans deeply.\n\n33:01.780 --> 33:04.060\n I'm humbled by the fact that that idea\n\n33:04.060 --> 33:06.940\n does not necessarily need to look anything like\n\n33:06.940 --> 33:09.300\n how humans experience the world.\n\n33:09.300 --> 33:14.300\n But there's a dance of human to robot connection\n\n33:14.780 --> 33:18.500\n the same way human to dog or human to cat connection,\n\n33:18.500 --> 33:21.820\n that there's a magic there to that interaction.\n\n33:21.820 --> 33:23.580\n And I'm not sure how to create that magic,\n\n33:23.580 --> 33:25.100\n but it's a worthy effort.\n\n33:25.100 --> 33:27.940\n I also love, just exactly as you said,\n\n33:27.940 --> 33:29.420\n on the question of consciousness\n\n33:29.420 --> 33:31.060\n or engineering consciousness,\n\n33:31.060 --> 33:34.020\n the fun thing about this problem\n\n33:34.980 --> 33:38.860\n is it seems obvious to me that a hundred years from now,\n\n33:38.860 --> 33:40.460\n no matter what we do today,\n\n33:41.340 --> 33:43.340\n people, if we're still here,\n\n33:43.340 --> 33:47.340\n will laugh at how silly our notions were.\n\n33:47.340 --> 33:49.900\n So like, it's almost impossible for me to imagine\n\n33:49.900 --> 33:54.900\n that we will truly solve this problem fully in my lifetime.\n\n33:56.340 --> 33:57.780\n And more than that,\n\n33:57.780 --> 34:02.620\n everything we'll do will be silly a hundred years from now,\n\n34:02.620 --> 34:05.660\n but it's still, that makes it fun to me\n\n34:05.660 --> 34:07.940\n because it's like you have the full freedom\n\n34:07.940 --> 34:11.260\n to not even be right, just to try.\n\n34:11.260 --> 34:13.100\n Just to try is freedom.\n\n34:13.100 --> 34:15.460\n And that's how I see that.\n\n34:15.460 --> 34:17.780\n Get me that T shirt, please.\n\n34:17.780 --> 34:18.660\n I love that.\n\n34:18.660 --> 34:22.100\n So, and human robot interaction is fascinating\n\n34:22.100 --> 34:24.260\n because it's like watching dancing.\n\n34:24.260 --> 34:28.340\n I've been dancing tango recently\n\n34:28.340 --> 34:31.100\n and just, it's like, there is no goal.\n\n34:31.100 --> 34:33.820\n The goal is to create something magical\n\n34:33.820 --> 34:37.620\n and whether consciousness or emotion\n\n34:37.620 --> 34:39.220\n or elegance of movement,\n\n34:39.220 --> 34:43.380\n all of those things aid in the creation of the magic.\n\n34:43.380 --> 34:46.060\n And it's a free, it's an art form to explore\n\n34:46.060 --> 34:49.900\n how to make that, how to create that\n\n34:49.900 --> 34:51.260\n in a way that's compelling.\n\n34:51.260 --> 34:54.420\n Yeah, I love the line in Sense of a Woman with Al Pacino\n\n34:54.420 --> 34:55.980\n where he's speaking about the tango\n\n34:55.980 --> 34:57.740\n and he said, really, it's just freedom\n\n34:57.740 --> 35:01.900\n that if you get tangled up, you just keep tangoing on.\n\n35:01.900 --> 35:06.420\n I still, to this day, I think first or second time\n\n35:06.420 --> 35:08.900\n I talked to Joe Rogan on his podcast,\n\n35:08.900 --> 35:11.540\n I said, we got into this heated argument\n\n35:11.540 --> 35:13.980\n about whether Sense of a Woman\n\n35:13.980 --> 35:15.580\n is a better movie than John Wick.\n\n35:16.780 --> 35:20.300\n Because it's one of my favorite movies for many reasons.\n\n35:20.300 --> 35:23.860\n One is Sense of a Woman.\n\n35:23.860 --> 35:24.700\n Partially.\n\n35:24.700 --> 35:25.540\n I didn't know that, by the way.\n\n35:25.540 --> 35:26.380\n I was just gonna.\n\n35:26.380 --> 35:27.220\n You just.\n\n35:27.220 --> 35:28.220\n Yeah, I didn't know if you would actually know\n\n35:28.220 --> 35:29.060\n of the movie.\n\n35:29.060 --> 35:29.900\n Awesome, awesome.\n\n35:29.900 --> 35:31.900\n No, yeah, I said, I love the tango scene.\n\n35:31.900 --> 35:34.660\n I love Al Pacino's performance.\n\n35:34.660 --> 35:35.820\n It's a wonderful movie.\n\n35:36.900 --> 35:39.380\n Then Joe was saying, John Wick is better.\n\n35:39.380 --> 35:41.460\n So we, to this day, argue about this.\n\n35:41.460 --> 35:44.980\n I think it depends on what conscious state you're in\n\n35:44.980 --> 35:46.980\n that you would be ready and receptive to.\n\n35:46.980 --> 35:50.460\n But Sense of a Woman, I think it has one of the best\n\n35:50.460 --> 35:52.740\n monologues at the end of the movie\n\n35:52.740 --> 35:57.020\n that has ever been written or at least performed.\n\n35:57.020 --> 36:01.940\n When Al Pacino defends the younger.\n\n36:01.940 --> 36:05.900\n Yeah, I often think about that.\n\n36:05.900 --> 36:09.940\n There's been times in my life, I don't know about you,\n\n36:09.940 --> 36:12.540\n where I wish I had an Al Pacino in my life,\n\n36:12.540 --> 36:17.540\n where integrity is really important in this life.\n\n36:18.260 --> 36:19.100\n It is.\n\n36:19.100 --> 36:20.780\n And sometimes you find yourself in places\n\n36:20.780 --> 36:25.560\n where there's pressure to sacrifice that integrity.\n\n36:25.560 --> 36:29.140\n And you want, what is it, Lieutenant Colonel\n\n36:29.140 --> 36:30.820\n or whatever he was.\n\n36:30.820 --> 36:31.660\n To come in.\n\n36:31.660 --> 36:32.500\n Slate.\n\n36:32.500 --> 36:36.140\n To come in on your side and scream at everyone\n\n36:36.140 --> 36:38.500\n and say, what the hell are we doing here?\n\n36:38.500 --> 36:41.260\n Being, you know, unfortunately British\n\n36:41.260 --> 36:44.340\n and sort of having that slightly awkward\n\n36:44.340 --> 36:45.420\n sort of Hugh Grant gene.\n\n36:45.420 --> 36:48.820\n It's very, very, very at the opposite end of the spectrum\n\n36:48.820 --> 36:51.820\n of the remarkable feat of Al Pacino\n\n36:51.820 --> 36:53.060\n at the end of that scene.\n\n36:53.060 --> 36:58.060\n But, and yeah, integrity is, it's a challenging thing\n\n36:59.160 --> 37:00.300\n and I value it much.\n\n37:00.300 --> 37:04.900\n And I think it can take 20 years to build a reputation\n\n37:04.900 --> 37:06.580\n and two minutes to lose it.\n\n37:06.580 --> 37:10.420\n And there is nothing more that I value than that integrity\n\n37:10.420 --> 37:13.580\n and, you know, if I'm ever wrong about anything,\n\n37:13.580 --> 37:16.860\n I truly don't want to be wrong for any longer\n\n37:16.860 --> 37:17.960\n than I have to be.\n\n37:19.420 --> 37:22.700\n You know, that's what being in some ways a scientist is.\n\n37:22.700 --> 37:25.460\n You're just driven by truth.\n\n37:25.460 --> 37:29.200\n And the irony relative to something like mathematics\n\n37:29.200 --> 37:31.900\n is that in science, you never find truth.\n\n37:31.900 --> 37:35.460\n What you do in science is you discount the things\n\n37:35.460 --> 37:38.020\n that are likely to be untrue,\n\n37:38.020 --> 37:42.220\n leaving only the possibility of what could be true.\n\n37:42.220 --> 37:46.620\n But in math, you know, when you create, you know, a proof,\n\n37:46.620 --> 37:51.620\n it's a proof for, you know, from that point forward,\n\n37:51.820 --> 37:54.300\n there is truth in mathematics.\n\n37:54.300 --> 37:56.980\n And there's, I think there's a beauty in that,\n\n37:56.980 --> 38:00.180\n but I kind of like the messiness of science\n\n38:00.180 --> 38:03.600\n because again, to me, it's less about the truth\n\n38:03.600 --> 38:07.220\n of the answer and it is more about the pursuit of questions.\n\n38:07.220 --> 38:10.100\n But their integrity becomes more and more important\n\n38:10.100 --> 38:11.800\n and it becomes more difficult.\n\n38:11.800 --> 38:12.980\n There's a lot of pressures,\n\n38:12.980 --> 38:14.100\n just like in the rest of the world,\n\n38:14.100 --> 38:17.180\n but there's a lot of pressures than a scientist.\n\n38:17.180 --> 38:19.420\n One is like funding sources.\n\n38:19.420 --> 38:21.360\n I've noticed this, that, you know,\n\n38:21.360 --> 38:24.580\n money affects everyone's mind, I think.\n\n38:24.580 --> 38:28.320\n I've been always somebody that I believe money can't,\n\n38:28.320 --> 38:31.480\n you can't buy my opinion.\n\n38:31.480 --> 38:34.380\n I don't care how much money, billions or trillions.\n\n38:34.380 --> 38:37.460\n But that pressure is there and you have to be\n\n38:37.460 --> 38:40.900\n very cognizant of it and make sure that your opinion\n\n38:40.900 --> 38:43.380\n is not defined by the funding sources.\n\n38:43.380 --> 38:48.260\n And then the other is just your own success of, you know,\n\n38:48.260 --> 38:50.700\n for a couple of decades, publishing an idea\n\n38:53.860 --> 38:55.460\n and then realizing at some point\n\n38:55.460 --> 38:57.860\n that that idea was wrong all along.\n\n38:57.860 --> 39:00.800\n And that's a tough thing for people to do,\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:03.200\n but that's also integrity is to walk away,\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:04.800\n is to say that you were wrong.\n\n39:06.180 --> 39:08.860\n That doesn't have to be in some big dramatic way.\n\n39:08.860 --> 39:11.860\n It could be in a bunch of tiny ways along the way.\n\n39:11.860 --> 39:12.700\n Right.\n\n39:12.700 --> 39:17.700\n Like reconfigure your intuition about a particular problem.\n\n39:18.800 --> 39:20.520\n That's, and all of that is integrity.\n\n39:20.520 --> 39:23.460\n When everybody in the room, you know,\n\n39:23.460 --> 39:24.500\n believes a certain thing,\n\n39:24.500 --> 39:27.440\n everybody in the community believes a certain thing,\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:31.000\n to be able to still be open minded in the face of that.\n\n39:31.000 --> 39:33.820\n Yeah, and I think it comes down in some ways\n\n39:33.820 --> 39:38.820\n to the issue of ego that you bond your correctness\n\n39:38.980 --> 39:41.820\n or your rightness, your scientific theory\n\n39:41.820 --> 39:45.820\n with your sense of ego.\n\n39:45.820 --> 39:48.740\n You know, I've never found it that difficult to let go\n\n39:48.740 --> 39:52.780\n of theories in the face of counter evidence\n\n39:52.780 --> 39:56.380\n in part because I have such low self esteem.\n\n39:56.380 --> 39:57.900\n Well, I kind of liked that.\n\n39:57.900 --> 39:59.020\n I always liked that combination.\n\n39:59.020 --> 40:01.620\n I have the same, I'm like very self critical,\n\n40:01.620 --> 40:03.460\n imposter syndrome, all those things,\n\n40:04.500 --> 40:05.740\n putting yourself below the podium,\n\n40:05.740 --> 40:08.140\n but at the same time having the ego\n\n40:08.140 --> 40:11.060\n that drives the ambition to work your ass off.\n\n40:11.060 --> 40:13.520\n Like some kind of weird drive,\n\n40:13.520 --> 40:16.740\n maybe like drive to be better.\n\n40:16.740 --> 40:18.940\n Like thinking of yourself as not that great\n\n40:18.940 --> 40:20.940\n and always driving to be better.\n\n40:20.940 --> 40:22.020\n And then at the same time,\n\n40:22.020 --> 40:25.940\n because that can be paralyzing and exhausting and so on,\n\n40:25.940 --> 40:28.360\n at the same time, just being grateful to be alive.\n\n40:28.360 --> 40:31.340\n But in the sciences, in the actual effort,\n\n40:31.340 --> 40:33.940\n never be satisfied, never think of yourself highly.\n\n40:33.940 --> 40:35.860\n It seems to be a nice combination.\n\n40:35.860 --> 40:39.700\n I very much hope that that is part of who I am\n\n40:39.700 --> 40:44.420\n and I remain very quietly motivated and driven.\n\n40:44.420 --> 40:47.980\n And I, like you, love the idea of perfection\n\n40:47.980 --> 40:49.700\n and I know I will never achieve it,\n\n40:49.700 --> 40:51.340\n but I will never stop trying to.\n\n40:52.220 --> 40:55.500\n So similar to you, which sounds weird\n\n40:55.500 --> 40:59.400\n because there's all these videos of me on the internet.\n\n41:01.060 --> 41:04.400\n So I think I just naturally lean into the things\n\n41:04.400 --> 41:07.020\n I'm afraid of and I'm uncomfortable doing.\n\n41:07.020 --> 41:09.120\n Like I'm very afraid of talking to people\n\n41:09.120 --> 41:12.700\n and just even before talking to you today,\n\n41:12.700 --> 41:16.100\n just a lot of anxiety and all those kinds of things.\n\n41:16.100 --> 41:17.540\n About talking to me?\n\n41:17.540 --> 41:18.380\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n41:18.380 --> 41:19.200\n Oh, I like.\n\n41:19.200 --> 41:20.040\n Nervousness.\n\n41:20.940 --> 41:24.540\n Fear in some cases, self doubt and all those kinds of things.\n\n41:24.540 --> 41:25.980\n But I do it anyway.\n\n41:25.980 --> 41:27.480\n So the reason I bring that up\n\n41:27.480 --> 41:32.120\n is you've launched a podcast.\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:32.960\n I have.\n\n41:34.540 --> 41:37.360\n Allow me to say, I think you're a great science communicator.\n\n41:37.360 --> 41:42.360\n So this challenge of being afraid\n\n41:44.180 --> 41:47.980\n or cautious of being in the public eye\n\n41:47.980 --> 41:51.420\n and yet having a longing to communicate\n\n41:51.420 --> 41:53.620\n some of the things you're excited about\n\n41:53.620 --> 41:55.900\n in the space of sleep and beyond.\n\n41:55.900 --> 41:57.800\n What's your vision with this project?\n\n41:59.180 --> 42:03.620\n I think firstly to that question, like you,\n\n42:03.620 --> 42:07.980\n I am always more afraid of not trying than trying.\n\n42:07.980 --> 42:08.820\n Yeah.\n\n42:08.820 --> 42:11.060\n That to me frightens me more.\n\n42:12.040 --> 42:13.500\n But with the podcast,\n\n42:13.500 --> 42:18.500\n I think really I have two very simple goals.\n\n42:18.660 --> 42:22.980\n I want to try and democratize the science of sleep\n\n42:22.980 --> 42:23.820\n and in doing so,\n\n42:23.820 --> 42:26.420\n my goal would be to try and reunite humanity\n\n42:26.420 --> 42:29.200\n with the sleep that it is so desperately bereft of.\n\n42:30.540 --> 42:33.820\n And if I can do that through a number of different means,\n\n42:35.480 --> 42:38.500\n the podcast is a little bit different than this format.\n\n42:38.500 --> 42:43.500\n It's going to be short form monologues from yours truly\n\n42:45.180 --> 42:47.780\n that will last usually less than just 10 minutes.\n\n42:47.780 --> 42:51.420\n And I see it as simply a little slice of sleep goodness\n\n42:51.420 --> 42:53.940\n that can accompany your waking day.\n\n42:53.940 --> 42:56.380\n It's hard to know what is the right way\n\n42:56.380 --> 42:58.440\n to do science communication.\n\n42:58.440 --> 43:01.620\n Like your friend, mine, Andrew Huberman,\n\n43:03.660 --> 43:05.460\n he's an incredible human being.\n\n43:05.460 --> 43:06.300\n Oh gosh.\n\n43:06.300 --> 43:09.420\n So he does like two hours of,\n\n43:09.420 --> 43:10.660\n I wonder how many takes he does.\n\n43:10.660 --> 43:12.820\n I don't know, but it looks like he doesn't do any.\n\n43:12.820 --> 43:16.300\n Yeah, I suspect he's that magnificent of a human being.\n\n43:16.300 --> 43:18.940\n When I talk to him in like in person,\n\n43:18.940 --> 43:21.580\n he always generates intelligent words,\n\n43:21.580 --> 43:24.180\n well cited, nonstop for hours.\n\n43:24.180 --> 43:25.700\n So I don't.\n\n43:25.700 --> 43:29.020\n He's a Gatling gun of information and it's pristine.\n\n43:29.020 --> 43:30.700\n And passion and all those kinds of things.\n\n43:30.700 --> 43:32.220\n So that's an interesting medium.\n\n43:32.220 --> 43:33.940\n I wouldn't have,\n\n43:35.260 --> 43:36.780\n it's funny because I wouldn't have done it\n\n43:36.780 --> 43:38.020\n the way he's doing it.\n\n43:38.020 --> 43:40.340\n I wouldn't advise him to do it the way he's doing it.\n\n43:40.340 --> 43:41.740\n Cause I thought there's no way you could do\n\n43:41.740 --> 43:42.580\n what you're doing.\n\n43:43.860 --> 43:45.540\n Cause it's a lot of work,\n\n43:45.540 --> 43:48.420\n but he is like doing an incredible job of it.\n\n43:48.420 --> 43:51.060\n I just think it's the same with like Dan Carlin\n\n43:51.060 --> 43:52.140\n and hardcore history.\n\n43:52.140 --> 43:56.700\n I thought that the way Andrew's doing it\n\n43:56.700 --> 44:00.860\n would crush him the way it crushes Dan Carlin.\n\n44:00.860 --> 44:04.660\n So Dan has so much pressure on him to do a good job\n\n44:04.660 --> 44:08.140\n that he ends up publishing like two episodes a year.\n\n44:08.140 --> 44:10.100\n So that pressure can be paralyzing.\n\n44:10.100 --> 44:13.580\n The pressure of like putting out like\n\n44:13.580 --> 44:16.140\n strong scientific statements\n\n44:16.140 --> 44:17.820\n that can be overwhelming.\n\n44:17.820 --> 44:21.540\n Now, Andrew seems to be just plowing through anyway.\n\n44:21.540 --> 44:25.220\n If there's mistakes, he'll say there's corrections and so on.\n\n44:25.220 --> 44:26.220\n I just, I wonder,\n\n44:26.220 --> 44:27.900\n I actually haven't talked to him too much about it.\n\n44:27.900 --> 44:30.820\n Like psychologically, how difficult is it\n\n44:30.820 --> 44:34.700\n to put yourself out there for an hour to a week\n\n44:34.700 --> 44:37.060\n of just nonstop dropping knowledge.\n\n44:37.980 --> 44:41.140\n Any one sentence of which could be totally wrong.\n\n44:41.140 --> 44:42.300\n It could be a mistake.\n\n44:42.300 --> 44:44.260\n And there will be mistakes.\n\n44:44.260 --> 44:47.460\n And I, in the first edition of my book,\n\n44:47.460 --> 44:50.020\n there were errors that we corrected\n\n44:50.020 --> 44:51.500\n in the second edition too.\n\n44:52.420 --> 44:55.860\n But there will be probabilistically,\n\n44:55.860 --> 44:59.100\n if you've got 10 facts per page of a book\n\n44:59.100 --> 45:02.500\n and you've got 350 pages,\n\n45:02.500 --> 45:05.260\n odds are it's probably not going to be\n\n45:05.260 --> 45:07.420\n utter perfection out the gate.\n\n45:07.420 --> 45:10.820\n And it will be the same way for Andrew too.\n\n45:11.780 --> 45:15.620\n But having the reverence of\n\n45:15.620 --> 45:19.380\n a humble mind\n\n45:19.380 --> 45:21.940\n and simply accepting the things that are wrong\n\n45:21.940 --> 45:23.900\n and correcting them and doing the right thing.\n\n45:23.900 --> 45:26.620\n I know that that's his mentality.\n\n45:26.620 --> 45:30.260\n I do want to say that I'm just kind of honored to be,\n\n45:30.260 --> 45:34.780\n it's a cool group of like scientific people\n\n45:34.780 --> 45:38.060\n that I'm fortunate enough to now be interacting with.\n\n45:38.060 --> 45:41.180\n It's you and Andrew and David Sinclair\n\n45:41.180 --> 45:43.100\n has been thinking about throwing his hat in the ring.\n\n45:43.100 --> 45:43.940\n Oh, I hope so.\n\n45:43.940 --> 45:46.740\n David is another one of those very special people\n\n45:46.740 --> 45:47.580\n in the world.\n\n45:47.580 --> 45:51.100\n So it's cool because podcasts are, it's cool.\n\n45:51.100 --> 45:53.460\n It's such a powerful medium of communication.\n\n45:53.460 --> 45:56.540\n It's much freer than more constrained\n\n45:56.540 --> 45:58.420\n like publications and so on.\n\n45:58.420 --> 46:01.860\n Or it's much more accessible and inspiring than like,\n\n46:01.860 --> 46:04.020\n I don't know, conference presentations or lectures.\n\n46:04.020 --> 46:06.900\n And so it's a really exciting medium to me.\n\n46:06.900 --> 46:08.860\n And it's cool that there's this like group of people\n\n46:08.860 --> 46:12.700\n that are becoming friends and putting stuff out there\n\n46:12.700 --> 46:13.660\n and supporting each other.\n\n46:13.660 --> 46:18.140\n So it's fun to also watch how that's going to evolve\n\n46:18.140 --> 46:20.860\n in your case, because I wonder it'll be two a month.\n\n46:20.860 --> 46:24.980\n Or devolve is the answer to that.\n\n46:24.980 --> 46:27.700\n Well, I mean, some of it is persistence\n\n46:27.700 --> 46:30.220\n through the challenges that we've been talking about,\n\n46:30.220 --> 46:31.060\n which is like.\n\n46:31.060 --> 46:32.460\n I think I've got a lot to learn.\n\n46:32.460 --> 46:33.300\n Yeah.\n\n46:33.300 --> 46:34.140\n But I will persist.\n\n46:35.700 --> 46:37.460\n Can I ask you some detailed stuff?\n\n46:37.460 --> 46:38.300\n You mentioned that.\n\n46:38.300 --> 46:41.620\n Oh my goodness, go anywhere you wish with sleep.\n\n46:41.620 --> 46:45.300\n So I'm a big fan of coffee and caffeine.\n\n46:45.300 --> 46:47.820\n And I've been, especially in the last few days,\n\n46:47.820 --> 46:50.140\n consuming a very large amount.\n\n46:50.140 --> 46:55.140\n And I'm cognizant of the fact that my body is affected\n\n46:55.660 --> 46:59.020\n by caffeine different than the anecdotal information\n\n46:59.020 --> 47:00.740\n that other people tell me.\n\n47:00.740 --> 47:03.900\n I seem to be not at all affected by it.\n\n47:03.900 --> 47:08.900\n It's almost, it feels like more like a ritual\n\n47:08.900 --> 47:12.140\n than it is a chemical boost to my performance.\n\n47:12.140 --> 47:15.380\n Like I can drink several cups of coffee right before bed\n\n47:15.380 --> 47:17.740\n and just knock out anyway.\n\n47:17.740 --> 47:20.220\n I'm not sure if it's a biological chemical\n\n47:20.220 --> 47:21.540\n or it has to do with just the fact\n\n47:21.540 --> 47:24.340\n that I'm consuming huge amounts of caffeine.\n\n47:24.340 --> 47:29.340\n All that to say, what do you think is the relationship\n\n47:29.540 --> 47:32.900\n between coffee and sleep, caffeine and sleep?\n\n47:32.900 --> 47:34.380\n If there's an interesting distinction there.\n\n47:34.380 --> 47:35.660\n There is a distinction.\n\n47:35.660 --> 47:37.580\n So I think the first thing to say,\n\n47:37.580 --> 47:40.180\n which is going to sound strange coming from me\n\n47:40.180 --> 47:41.620\n is drink coffee.\n\n47:43.540 --> 47:46.460\n The health benefits associated with drinking coffee\n\n47:46.460 --> 47:49.780\n are really quite well established now.\n\n47:51.140 --> 47:54.180\n But I think that the counterpoint to that,\n\n47:54.180 --> 47:57.860\n well, firstly, the dose and the timing make the poison.\n\n47:57.860 --> 48:01.220\n And I'll perhaps come back to that in just a second.\n\n48:01.220 --> 48:06.220\n But for coffee, it's actually not the caffeine.\n\n48:06.220 --> 48:09.620\n So, a lot of people have asked me\n\n48:09.620 --> 48:12.140\n about this rightful paradox between the fact\n\n48:12.140 --> 48:15.580\n that sleep provides all of these incredible health benefits\n\n48:15.580 --> 48:19.460\n and then coffee, which can have a deleterious impact\n\n48:19.460 --> 48:23.020\n on your sleep has a whole collection of health benefits.\n\n48:23.020 --> 48:25.460\n Many of them Venn diagram overlapping\n\n48:25.460 --> 48:27.380\n with those that sleep provides.\n\n48:27.380 --> 48:30.220\n How on earth can you reconcile those two?\n\n48:30.220 --> 48:33.740\n And the answer is that, well, the answer is very simple.\n\n48:33.740 --> 48:37.780\n It's called antioxidants, that it turns out\n\n48:37.780 --> 48:40.820\n that for most people in Western civilization\n\n48:40.820 --> 48:44.060\n because of diet, not being quite what it should be,\n\n48:44.940 --> 48:49.300\n the major source through which they obtain antioxidants\n\n48:49.300 --> 48:50.380\n is the coffee bean.\n\n48:50.380 --> 48:53.700\n So the humble coffee bean has now been asked\n\n48:53.700 --> 48:57.580\n to carry the astronomical weight of serving up\n\n48:57.580 --> 49:01.900\n the large majority of people's antioxidant needs.\n\n49:01.900 --> 49:04.820\n And you can see this if, for example,\n\n49:04.820 --> 49:08.340\n you look at the health benefits of decaffeinated coffee,\n\n49:08.340 --> 49:10.260\n it has a whole constellation\n\n49:10.260 --> 49:12.100\n of really great health benefits too.\n\n49:12.100 --> 49:13.420\n So it's not the caffeine.\n\n49:13.420 --> 49:15.300\n And that's why I liked what you said,\n\n49:15.300 --> 49:17.740\n this sort of separation of church and state\n\n49:17.740 --> 49:19.900\n between coffee and caffeine.\n\n49:19.900 --> 49:23.340\n It's not the caffeine, it's the coffee bean itself\n\n49:23.340 --> 49:24.820\n that provides those health benefits.\n\n49:24.820 --> 49:29.620\n But coming back to how it impacts sleep,\n\n49:29.620 --> 49:33.540\n it impacts sleep in probably at least three different ways.\n\n49:33.540 --> 49:37.060\n The first is that for most people,\n\n49:37.060 --> 49:39.460\n caffeine can make it obviously a little harder\n\n49:39.460 --> 49:41.140\n to fall asleep.\n\n49:41.140 --> 49:44.060\n Caffeine can make it harder to stay asleep.\n\n49:44.060 --> 49:46.100\n But let's say that you are one of those individuals\n\n49:46.100 --> 49:48.060\n and I think you are, and you can say,\n\n49:48.060 --> 49:50.700\n look, I can have three or four espressos with dinner\n\n49:50.700 --> 49:52.300\n and I fall asleep just fine\n\n49:52.300 --> 49:54.500\n and I stay asleep soundly across the night.\n\n49:54.500 --> 49:56.220\n So there's no problem.\n\n49:56.220 --> 50:00.300\n The downside there is that even if that is true,\n\n50:00.300 --> 50:03.820\n the amount of deep sleep that you get will not be as deep.\n\n50:03.820 --> 50:05.500\n And so you will actually lose somewhere\n\n50:05.500 --> 50:08.500\n between 10 to 30% of your deep sleep\n\n50:08.500 --> 50:11.300\n if you drink caffeine in the evening.\n\n50:11.300 --> 50:12.940\n So to give you some context,\n\n50:12.940 --> 50:16.460\n to drop your deep sleep by let's say 20%,\n\n50:16.460 --> 50:19.260\n I'd probably have to age you by 15 years,\n\n50:19.260 --> 50:22.540\n or you could do it every night with a cup of coffee.\n\n50:22.540 --> 50:24.140\n I think the fourth component\n\n50:24.140 --> 50:27.140\n that is perhaps less well understood about coffee\n\n50:27.140 --> 50:29.660\n is its timing, and that's why I was saying\n\n50:29.660 --> 50:31.580\n the timing and the dose make the poison.\n\n50:31.580 --> 50:32.900\n The dose, by the way,\n\n50:32.900 --> 50:35.820\n once you get past about three cups of coffee a day,\n\n50:35.820 --> 50:38.420\n the health benefits actually start to turn down\n\n50:38.420 --> 50:40.220\n in the opposite direction.\n\n50:40.220 --> 50:41.980\n So there is a U shape function.\n\n50:41.980 --> 50:44.220\n It's sort of the Goldilocks syndrome,\n\n50:44.220 --> 50:47.980\n not too little, not too much, just the right amount.\n\n50:47.980 --> 50:50.700\n The second component is the timing though.\n\n50:50.700 --> 50:55.220\n Caffeine has half life of about five to six hours,\n\n50:55.220 --> 50:57.820\n meaning that after five to six hours,\n\n50:57.820 --> 51:01.140\n 50% of that on average for the average adult\n\n51:01.140 --> 51:02.500\n is still in the system,\n\n51:02.500 --> 51:06.020\n which means that it has a quarter life of 10 to 12 hours.\n\n51:06.020 --> 51:08.260\n So in other words, if you have a coffee at noon,\n\n51:08.260 --> 51:10.580\n a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating\n\n51:10.580 --> 51:12.620\n in your brain at midnight.\n\n51:12.620 --> 51:14.820\n So having a cup of coffee at noon,\n\n51:14.820 --> 51:16.220\n one could argue is the equivalent\n\n51:16.220 --> 51:18.060\n of tucking yourself into bed at midnight,\n\n51:18.060 --> 51:19.580\n and before you turn the light out,\n\n51:19.580 --> 51:22.180\n you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee.\n\n51:22.180 --> 51:24.300\n But that doesn't still answer your question\n\n51:24.300 --> 51:26.220\n as to why are you so immune?\n\n51:26.220 --> 51:28.140\n So I'm someone who is actually unfortunately\n\n51:28.140 --> 51:29.500\n very sensitive to caffeine.\n\n51:29.500 --> 51:34.060\n And if I have even two cups of coffee in the morning,\n\n51:34.980 --> 51:37.260\n I don't sleep as well that night.\n\n51:37.260 --> 51:40.660\n And I find it miserable because I love the smell of coffee.\n\n51:40.660 --> 51:41.940\n I love the routine.\n\n51:41.940 --> 51:43.540\n I love the ritual.\n\n51:43.540 --> 51:46.220\n I think I would love to be invested in it.\n\n51:46.220 --> 51:47.620\n It's just terrible for my sleep.\n\n51:47.620 --> 51:49.420\n So I switched to decaf.\n\n51:49.420 --> 51:52.620\n There is a difference from one individual to the next,\n\n51:52.620 --> 51:56.660\n and it's controlled by a set of liver enzymes\n\n51:56.660 --> 52:00.740\n called cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n\n52:00.740 --> 52:03.020\n And there is a particular gene\n\n52:03.020 --> 52:06.660\n that if you have a different sort of version of this gene,\n\n52:06.660 --> 52:11.580\n it's called CYP1A2.\n\n52:11.580 --> 52:14.700\n That gene will determine the speed\n\n52:14.700 --> 52:18.100\n of the clearance of caffeine from your system.\n\n52:18.100 --> 52:20.260\n Some people will have a version of that gene\n\n52:20.260 --> 52:23.020\n that is very effective and efficient\n\n52:23.020 --> 52:24.660\n at clearing that caffeine.\n\n52:24.660 --> 52:28.460\n And so their half life could be as short as two hours\n\n52:28.460 --> 52:30.900\n rather than five to six hours.\n\n52:30.900 --> 52:34.100\n Other people, hands up Matt Walker,\n\n52:34.100 --> 52:35.700\n have a version of that gene\n\n52:35.700 --> 52:40.340\n that is not very effective at clearing out the caffeine.\n\n52:40.340 --> 52:43.700\n And therefore their half life sort of sensitivity\n\n52:43.700 --> 52:48.140\n could be somewhere between eight to nine hours.\n\n52:48.140 --> 52:50.740\n So we understand that there are individual differences,\n\n52:50.740 --> 52:55.740\n but overall, I guess the top line here is drink coffee\n\n52:56.580 --> 52:58.420\n and understand that it's not the caffeine,\n\n52:58.420 --> 53:00.060\n it's the coffee that's the benefit\n\n53:00.060 --> 53:01.300\n and the dose makes the poison.\n\n53:01.300 --> 53:04.860\n Is there some aspect to it that it's like a muscle\n\n53:04.860 --> 53:08.220\n in terms of all the combination of letters and numbers\n\n53:08.220 --> 53:09.060\n that you just said?\n\n53:09.060 --> 53:13.860\n Is there some aspect that if I can improve\n\n53:13.860 --> 53:15.740\n the quarter life, the half life,\n\n53:15.740 --> 53:19.060\n could decrease that number if I just practice?\n\n53:19.940 --> 53:21.380\n Like I drink a lot of coffee,\n\n53:21.380 --> 53:25.500\n so like habit alters how your body's able\n\n53:25.500 --> 53:27.180\n to get rid of the caffeine.\n\n53:27.180 --> 53:30.180\n Not how the body is able to get rid of the caffeine,\n\n53:30.180 --> 53:34.540\n but it does alter how sensitive the body is to the caffeine.\n\n53:34.540 --> 53:36.700\n And it's not at the level of the enzyme\n\n53:36.700 --> 53:38.780\n degrading the caffeine.\n\n53:38.780 --> 53:41.460\n It's at the level of the receptors\n\n53:41.460 --> 53:44.100\n that caffeine will act upon.\n\n53:44.100 --> 53:46.940\n Now it turns out that those are called adenosine receptors\n\n53:46.940 --> 53:49.100\n and maybe we can speak about what adenosine is\n\n53:49.100 --> 53:51.180\n and sleep pressure and all of that good stuff.\n\n53:51.180 --> 53:55.260\n But as you start to drink more and more coffee,\n\n53:56.300 --> 53:58.940\n the body tries to fight back\n\n53:58.940 --> 54:01.100\n and it happens with many different drugs by the way,\n\n54:01.100 --> 54:03.100\n and it's called tolerance.\n\n54:03.100 --> 54:06.660\n And so one of the ways that your body becomes tolerant\n\n54:06.660 --> 54:10.100\n to a drug is that the receptors that the drug is binding to,\n\n54:10.100 --> 54:13.900\n these sort of welcome sites, these sort of picture myths,\n\n54:13.900 --> 54:16.300\n as it were, that receive the drug,\n\n54:16.300 --> 54:21.300\n those start to get taken away from the surface of the cell\n\n54:21.620 --> 54:25.100\n and it's what we call receptor internalization.\n\n54:25.100 --> 54:28.260\n So the cell starts to think, gee whiz,\n\n54:28.260 --> 54:31.420\n there's a lot of stimulation going on, this is too much.\n\n54:31.420 --> 54:35.580\n So I'm just going to, when normally I would coat my cell\n\n54:35.580 --> 54:38.780\n with let's just say five of these receptors\n\n54:38.780 --> 54:40.620\n for argument's sake,\n\n54:40.620 --> 54:43.260\n things are going a little bit too ballistic right now.\n\n54:43.260 --> 54:46.100\n I'm going to take away at least two of those receptors\n\n54:46.100 --> 54:49.100\n and downscale it to just having three of those.\n\n54:49.100 --> 54:52.860\n And now you need two cups of coffee to get the same effect\n\n54:52.860 --> 54:55.540\n that one cup of coffee got you before.\n\n54:55.540 --> 55:00.540\n And that's why then when you go cold turkey on coffee,\n\n55:01.020 --> 55:05.380\n all of a sudden the system has equilibrated itself\n\n55:05.380 --> 55:08.540\n to expecting X amount of stimulation\n\n55:08.540 --> 55:10.140\n and now all of that stimulation is gone.\n\n55:10.140 --> 55:12.940\n So it's now got too few receptors\n\n55:12.940 --> 55:15.660\n and you have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome.\n\n55:15.660 --> 55:18.500\n And that's why, for example, with drugs of abuse,\n\n55:18.500 --> 55:22.540\n things like heroin, when people go into abstinence,\n\n55:23.700 --> 55:26.700\n as they're sort of moving into their addiction,\n\n55:26.700 --> 55:30.620\n they will build up a progressive tolerance to that drug.\n\n55:30.620 --> 55:34.140\n So they need to take more of it to get the same high.\n\n55:34.140 --> 55:38.140\n But then if they go cold turkey for some period of time,\n\n55:38.140 --> 55:40.620\n the system goes back to being more sensitive again.\n\n55:40.620 --> 55:43.380\n It starts to repopulate the surface of the cell\n\n55:43.380 --> 55:44.660\n with these receptors.\n\n55:44.660 --> 55:47.660\n But now when they reuse and they fall off the wagon,\n\n55:47.660 --> 55:49.420\n if they go back to the same dose\n\n55:49.420 --> 55:53.060\n that they were using before 10 weeks ago\n\n55:53.060 --> 55:56.500\n or three months ago, that dose can kill them.\n\n55:56.500 --> 55:58.140\n They can have an overdose.\n\n55:58.140 --> 56:00.300\n Even though they were using the same amount\n\n56:00.300 --> 56:02.260\n at those two different times,\n\n56:02.260 --> 56:05.780\n the difference is that it's not the dose of the drug,\n\n56:05.780 --> 56:08.140\n it's the sensitivity of the system.\n\n56:08.140 --> 56:10.980\n And that's the same thing that we see with caffeine.\n\n56:10.980 --> 56:13.780\n In terms of training the muscle, as it were,\n\n56:13.780 --> 56:16.580\n the system becomes less sensitive, can calibrate.\n\n56:17.620 --> 56:22.620\n Is there a time, the number of hours before bed,\n\n56:22.900 --> 56:26.620\n that's a safe bet to most people to recommend\n\n56:27.500 --> 56:31.220\n you shouldn't drink caffeine this many hours?\n\n56:31.220 --> 56:33.420\n Like, is there an average half life\n\n56:33.420 --> 56:35.380\n that you should be aiming at?\n\n56:35.380 --> 56:38.060\n Or is this advice kind of impossible\n\n56:38.060 --> 56:39.580\n because there's so much variability?\n\n56:39.580 --> 56:41.260\n There is huge variability.\n\n56:41.260 --> 56:45.300\n And I think everyone themselves to a degree knows it,\n\n56:45.300 --> 56:47.980\n although I'll put a caveat on that too\n\n56:47.980 --> 56:50.420\n because it's a slightly dangerous point.\n\n56:50.420 --> 56:53.180\n So the recommendation for the average adult\n\n56:53.180 --> 56:55.660\n and who, where is the average adult in society?\n\n56:55.660 --> 56:56.540\n There is no such thing.\n\n56:56.540 --> 56:58.460\n But for the average adult,\n\n56:58.460 --> 57:02.540\n it would be probably cutting yourself off maybe 10 hours\n\n57:02.540 --> 57:03.380\n before.\n\n57:03.380 --> 57:06.260\n So assuming a normative bedtime in society,\n\n57:06.260 --> 57:10.900\n I would say try to stop drinking caffeine before 2 p.m.\n\n57:10.900 --> 57:13.140\n and just keep an eye out.\n\n57:13.140 --> 57:14.500\n And if you're struggling with sleep,\n\n57:14.500 --> 57:18.060\n dial down the caffeine and see if it makes a difference.\n\n57:18.060 --> 57:22.500\n Can I ask you about sleep and learning?\n\n57:22.500 --> 57:25.420\n So how does sleep affect learning?\n\n57:25.420 --> 57:30.420\n Sleep before learning, sleep after learning,\n\n57:30.420 --> 57:33.100\n which are both fascinating kind of dynamics\n\n57:33.100 --> 57:36.580\n of the mind's interaction with this extra conscious state.\n\n57:37.940 --> 57:42.260\n Yeah, sleep is profoundly and very intimately related\n\n57:42.260 --> 57:45.700\n to your memory systems and your informational systems.\n\n57:46.620 --> 57:48.660\n The first is you just mentioned is that\n\n57:48.660 --> 57:53.380\n sleep before learning will essentially prepare your brain\n\n57:53.380 --> 57:56.820\n almost like a dry sponge ready to sort of,\n\n57:56.820 --> 57:59.140\n you know, initially soak up new information.\n\n57:59.140 --> 58:01.180\n In other words, you need sleep before learning\n\n58:01.180 --> 58:04.900\n to effectively imprint information into the brain\n\n58:04.900 --> 58:07.900\n to lay down fresh memory traces.\n\n58:07.900 --> 58:10.980\n And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain,\n\n58:10.980 --> 58:13.940\n and we know we've studied these memory circuits,\n\n58:13.940 --> 58:16.980\n will, you know, they essentially become waterlogged\n\n58:16.980 --> 58:18.460\n as it were for the sponge analogy,\n\n58:18.460 --> 58:23.460\n and you can't absorb the information as effectively.\n\n58:23.900 --> 58:26.300\n So you need sleep before learning,\n\n58:26.300 --> 58:30.140\n but you also need sleep unfortunately after learning too,\n\n58:30.140 --> 58:33.580\n to then take those freshly minted memories\n\n58:33.580 --> 58:36.180\n and effectively hit the save button on them,\n\n58:36.180 --> 58:38.700\n but it's nowhere near as quick as a digital system.\n\n58:38.700 --> 58:42.100\n It takes hours because it's a physical biological change\n\n58:42.100 --> 58:45.020\n that happens at the level of brain cells.\n\n58:45.020 --> 58:49.500\n But sleep after learning will cement and solidify\n\n58:49.500 --> 58:53.300\n that new memory into the neural architecture of the brain,\n\n58:53.300 --> 58:56.900\n therefore making it less likely to be forgotten.\n\n58:56.900 --> 59:01.300\n So, you know, I often think of sleep in that way as,\n\n59:01.300 --> 59:04.580\n it's almost sort of future proofing information.\n\n59:04.580 --> 59:06.940\n In what way?\n\n59:06.940 --> 59:11.940\n Well, it means that it gives it a higher degree of assurance\n\n59:11.940 --> 59:15.060\n to be remembered in the future\n\n59:15.060 --> 59:19.380\n rather than go through the sort of degradation\n\n59:19.380 --> 59:21.260\n that we think of as forgetting.\n\n59:22.180 --> 59:26.380\n So the brain has in some ways by default,\n\n59:26.380 --> 59:28.140\n you know, there is forget,\n\n59:28.140 --> 59:29.900\n and actually I would love to,\n\n59:29.900 --> 59:31.900\n I was going to say sleep is relevant for memory\n\n59:31.900 --> 59:33.220\n in three different ways,\n\n59:33.220 --> 59:34.700\n but I'm going to amend that\n\n59:34.700 --> 59:36.820\n and say there's four different ways,\n\n59:36.820 --> 59:41.820\n which is learning, maintaining, memorizing,\n\n59:42.940 --> 59:47.740\n abstraction, assimilation, association, then forgetting,\n\n59:47.740 --> 59:50.460\n which the last one sounds oxymoronic\n\n59:50.460 --> 59:53.460\n based on the former three, but I'll see if I can explain.\n\n59:53.460 --> 59:56.140\n So sleep after learning then sort of, you know,\n\n59:57.420 --> 1:00:02.420\n sets that information like amber in solidification.\n\n1:00:02.420 --> 1:00:05.780\n The third benefit, however, is that sleep,\n\n1:00:05.780 --> 1:00:08.660\n we've learned more recently is much more intelligent\n\n1:00:08.660 --> 1:00:10.700\n than we ever gave it credit for.\n\n1:00:10.700 --> 1:00:14.380\n Sleep doesn't simply just take individual memories\n\n1:00:14.380 --> 1:00:15.980\n and strengthen them.\n\n1:00:15.980 --> 1:00:20.260\n Sleep will then intelligently integrate and cross link\n\n1:00:20.260 --> 1:00:23.260\n and associate that information together.\n\n1:00:24.220 --> 1:00:27.420\n And it's almost like informational alchemy.\n\n1:00:27.420 --> 1:00:29.220\n So that you wake up the next morning\n\n1:00:29.220 --> 1:00:33.220\n with a revised mind wide web of associations.\n\n1:00:34.740 --> 1:00:36.820\n And that's probably the reason that, you know,\n\n1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:39.380\n you've never been told to stay awake on a problem.\n\n1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:44.900\n And in every language that I've inquired about that phrase\n\n1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:47.940\n or something very similar seems to exist,\n\n1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:52.620\n which means to me that this creative associative benefit\n\n1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:55.140\n of sleep transcends cultural boundaries.\n\n1:00:55.140 --> 1:00:58.380\n It is a common experience across humanity.\n\n1:00:58.380 --> 1:01:03.380\n Now I should note that I think the French translation\n\n1:01:05.140 --> 1:01:07.340\n of that is much closer to you.\n\n1:01:07.340 --> 1:01:08.980\n I think you sleep with a problem.\n\n1:01:08.980 --> 1:01:11.340\n Whereas the British, you sleep on a problem.\n\n1:01:11.340 --> 1:01:12.900\n The French, you sleep with a problem.\n\n1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:15.060\n I think it says so much about the romantic difference\n\n1:01:15.060 --> 1:01:18.660\n between the British and the French, but let's not go there.\n\n1:01:19.580 --> 1:01:20.420\n That's brilliant.\n\n1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:23.380\n So such a subtle, but such a fundamental difference.\n\n1:01:23.380 --> 1:01:24.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:24.220 --> 1:01:25.660\n Oh, goodness me.\n\n1:01:25.660 --> 1:01:27.260\n Sleep with the problem.\n\n1:01:27.260 --> 1:01:28.540\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:01:28.540 --> 1:01:29.940\n That's why I love the French.\n\n1:01:31.380 --> 1:01:35.140\n So, and we can sort of double click on any one of these\n\n1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:38.620\n and go into detail, but the fourth,\n\n1:01:38.620 --> 1:01:43.620\n I became really enchanted by about eight years ago\n\n1:01:44.020 --> 1:01:46.860\n in our research, which was this idea of forgetting.\n\n1:01:48.380 --> 1:01:52.900\n And I started to think that forgetting may be the price\n\n1:01:52.900 --> 1:01:54.580\n that we pay for remembering.\n\n1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:59.580\n And in that sense, there is an enormous benefit\n\n1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:04.500\n to letting go.\n\n1:02:05.940 --> 1:02:08.380\n And you may be thinking, that sounds ridiculous.\n\n1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:09.740\n I don't want to forget.\n\n1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:13.220\n In fact, my biggest problem is I keep forgetting things,\n\n1:02:13.220 --> 1:02:17.900\n but the brain has a, well, we believe,\n\n1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:20.500\n has a finite storage capacity.\n\n1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:22.500\n We can't prove it yet, but my suspicion is\n\n1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:23.460\n that that's probably true.\n\n1:02:23.460 --> 1:02:25.540\n It doesn't have an infinite storage capacity.\n\n1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:26.860\n It has constraints.\n\n1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:31.540\n If that's the case, we can't simply go through life\n\n1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:36.420\n being constantly informational aggregators\n\n1:02:37.740 --> 1:02:39.860\n unless we are programmed to say,\n\n1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:43.140\n we've got a hard drive space of about 85 to 90 years\n\n1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:44.780\n and we're good and we can do that.\n\n1:02:44.780 --> 1:02:45.940\n Maybe that's true.\n\n1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:46.940\n I don't think that's true.\n\n1:02:46.940 --> 1:02:50.620\n I think forgetting is an incredibly good and useful thing.\n\n1:02:50.620 --> 1:02:54.180\n So for example, it's not beneficial\n\n1:02:54.180 --> 1:02:57.100\n from an evolutionary perspective for me to remember\n\n1:02:57.100 --> 1:02:59.340\n where I parked my car three years ago.\n\n1:03:00.780 --> 1:03:04.740\n So it's important that I can remember today's parking spot,\n\n1:03:04.740 --> 1:03:08.100\n but I don't want to have the junk kind of DNA\n\n1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:12.940\n from a memory perspective of where I parked my car\n\n1:03:12.940 --> 1:03:13.980\n two years ago.\n\n1:03:15.020 --> 1:03:17.220\n Now, I actually have in some ways a problem\n\n1:03:17.220 --> 1:03:19.460\n with forgetting, and again, I'm not trying\n\n1:03:19.460 --> 1:03:22.260\n to sort of be laudatory, but you know,\n\n1:03:22.260 --> 1:03:24.900\n I tend not to forget too many things.\n\n1:03:24.900 --> 1:03:27.140\n And I don't think that that's a good thing.\n\n1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:31.500\n And there's a wonderful neurologist, Luria,\n\n1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:35.380\n who wrote a book called The Mind of the Mnemonicist.\n\n1:03:35.380 --> 1:03:37.900\n And it was a brilliant book,\n\n1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:40.660\n both because it was written exquisitely,\n\n1:03:40.660 --> 1:03:44.820\n but he was studying these sort of memory savants\n\n1:03:44.820 --> 1:03:49.420\n who basically could remember everything that he gave them.\n\n1:03:49.420 --> 1:03:53.540\n And he tried to find a chink in their armor.\n\n1:03:53.540 --> 1:03:56.860\n And the first half of the book is essentially about him\n\n1:03:56.860 --> 1:04:01.700\n seeing how far he can push them before they fail.\n\n1:04:01.700 --> 1:04:03.740\n And he never found that place.\n\n1:04:03.740 --> 1:04:08.740\n He could never find a place where they stopped remembering.\n\n1:04:08.980 --> 1:04:10.740\n And then in his brilliance,\n\n1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:13.060\n he turned the question on its head.\n\n1:04:13.060 --> 1:04:17.660\n He said, not what is the benefit of constantly remembering,\n\n1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:22.220\n but instead, what is the detriment to never forgetting?\n\n1:04:22.220 --> 1:04:24.700\n And when you start to realize his descriptions\n\n1:04:24.700 --> 1:04:26.980\n of those individuals, it's probably a life\n\n1:04:26.980 --> 1:04:28.180\n that you would not want.\n\n1:04:29.540 --> 1:04:31.860\n But it's fascinating both from a human perspective,\n\n1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:33.460\n but also AI perspective.\n\n1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:38.300\n There's a big challenge in the machine learning community\n\n1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:40.620\n of how to build systems that are able to remember\n\n1:04:40.620 --> 1:04:44.900\n for prolonged periods of time, lifelong continuous learning.\n\n1:04:44.900 --> 1:04:48.100\n So where you build up information over time.\n\n1:04:48.100 --> 1:04:51.140\n So memory is one of the biggest open problems\n\n1:04:51.140 --> 1:04:54.580\n in AI and machine learning.\n\n1:04:54.580 --> 1:04:55.820\n But at the same time,\n\n1:04:55.820 --> 1:05:00.140\n the right way to formulate memory is actually forgetting\n\n1:05:00.140 --> 1:05:03.460\n because you have to be exceptionally selective\n\n1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:05.540\n at which kind of stuff you remember.\n\n1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:07.420\n And that's where the step of assimilation,\n\n1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:09.900\n integration that you're referring to is really important.\n\n1:05:09.900 --> 1:05:12.660\n I mean, we forget most of the things.\n\n1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:16.660\n And the question is exactly the cost of forgetting\n\n1:05:16.660 --> 1:05:20.380\n at the very edge of stuff that could be important\n\n1:05:20.380 --> 1:05:24.140\n or could not be, how do we remember or not those things?\n\n1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:28.340\n Like for example, doing a podcast,\n\n1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:32.340\n I've become cognizant of one feature of my forgetting\n\n1:05:32.340 --> 1:05:36.780\n that's been problematic, which is I forget names\n\n1:05:36.780 --> 1:05:39.340\n and titles of books and so on.\n\n1:05:39.340 --> 1:05:43.540\n So when I read, I remember ideas.\n\n1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:47.020\n I remember quotes, I remember statements\n\n1:05:47.020 --> 1:05:50.340\n and like that's the space in which I'm thinking.\n\n1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:53.060\n But when you communicate to others,\n\n1:05:53.060 --> 1:05:56.660\n you have to say this person in this book said that.\n\n1:05:56.660 --> 1:05:59.300\n So it's the same thing with like Andrew Huberman\n\n1:05:59.300 --> 1:06:01.140\n is masterful at this.\n\n1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:02.500\n This is important academia,\n\n1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:04.300\n remembering the authors of a paper\n\n1:06:04.300 --> 1:06:09.060\n and the title of the paper as part of remembering the idea.\n\n1:06:09.060 --> 1:06:12.940\n And I've been feeling the cost of not being able\n\n1:06:12.940 --> 1:06:15.460\n to naturally remember those things.\n\n1:06:15.460 --> 1:06:17.940\n And so that's something I need to sort of work on,\n\n1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:18.780\n but that's an example.\n\n1:06:18.780 --> 1:06:20.060\n Are you good with faces?\n\n1:06:20.060 --> 1:06:21.540\n Yes, very good at faces.\n\n1:06:21.540 --> 1:06:23.060\n But not good with names.\n\n1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:25.140\n So I am exactly like you.\n\n1:06:25.140 --> 1:06:28.860\n And there is an understanding of that in the brain too.\n\n1:06:28.860 --> 1:06:31.580\n We understand that there is partitioning of those\n\n1:06:31.580 --> 1:06:33.260\n in terms of the territory of the brain\n\n1:06:33.260 --> 1:06:36.060\n that takes care of faces and facts and places\n\n1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:37.940\n and that they can be separate.\n\n1:06:37.940 --> 1:06:40.540\n So I will never forget a face,\n\n1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:44.460\n but as I said, I usually forget very little,\n\n1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:47.580\n but for some reason, names are a struggle.\n\n1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:48.420\n I think in some ways,\n\n1:06:48.420 --> 1:06:50.900\n because I'm probably just a slightly anxious person.\n\n1:06:50.900 --> 1:06:52.140\n So when you first meet someone,\n\n1:06:52.140 --> 1:06:55.340\n which is usually the time when a name is introduced,\n\n1:06:55.340 --> 1:06:57.460\n you were saying you were sort of anxious maybe\n\n1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:59.700\n about sort of sitting down with me,\n\n1:06:59.700 --> 1:07:04.340\n but I find that a little bit activating.\n\n1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:06.780\n And so it's not as though there's anything wrong\n\n1:07:06.780 --> 1:07:07.620\n with my memory.\n\n1:07:07.620 --> 1:07:09.500\n It's just the emotional state I'm in\n\n1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.580\n when I'm first meeting someone.\n\n1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:12.780\n It's a little bit perturbing,\n\n1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:15.300\n but I will never forget the face.\n\n1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:16.580\n I completely relate to that\n\n1:07:16.580 --> 1:07:19.140\n because I almost don't hear people's names\n\n1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:21.420\n when they tell me because I'm so anxious.\n\n1:07:21.420 --> 1:07:22.900\n Yeah.\n\n1:07:22.900 --> 1:07:27.260\n But I think there's certain quirks of social interaction\n\n1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:30.460\n that show that you care about the person,\n\n1:07:30.460 --> 1:07:31.860\n that you remember that person,\n\n1:07:31.860 --> 1:07:33.580\n that they matter to you,\n\n1:07:33.580 --> 1:07:35.580\n that they had an impact on you.\n\n1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:36.980\n And one of the ways to show that\n\n1:07:36.980 --> 1:07:39.020\n is you remember their name.\n\n1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:40.060\n But that's a quirk to me\n\n1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:45.060\n because a lot of people I meet have a deep impact on me,\n\n1:07:46.140 --> 1:07:50.700\n but I can't communicate that unless I know their name,\n\n1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:54.980\n unless I know some of the details\n\n1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:58.700\n that we humans seem to use to communicate\n\n1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:00.180\n that we remember each other.\n\n1:08:00.180 --> 1:08:04.980\n What I remember well is the feeling we shared,\n\n1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:07.420\n is the experience we shared.\n\n1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:10.460\n What I don't remember well is the detailed labels\n\n1:08:10.460 --> 1:08:12.100\n of those experiences.\n\n1:08:12.100 --> 1:08:14.100\n And I need to certainly work on that.\n\n1:08:14.100 --> 1:08:15.060\n I don't know.\n\n1:08:15.060 --> 1:08:19.300\n I think it's just allowing yourself to be innate\n\n1:08:19.300 --> 1:08:22.700\n and who you are is also a beautiful thing too.\n\n1:08:22.700 --> 1:08:24.580\n I'm not suggesting it's not important\n\n1:08:24.580 --> 1:08:26.900\n to try and better oneself.\n\n1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:29.780\n But I also sometimes worry about the misery\n\n1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:31.060\n that that puts us in.\n\n1:08:31.060 --> 1:08:35.940\n But like you, I do struggle with name,\n\n1:08:35.940 --> 1:08:39.900\n but I know the first time when we met in the lobby,\n\n1:08:40.740 --> 1:08:43.660\n I know exactly what you look like.\n\n1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:45.220\n I know that you were wearing headphones.\n\n1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.580\n I know the shape and the size of those headphones.\n\n1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:49.020\n You didn't have your black jacket on.\n\n1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:51.620\n I know exactly what the weave of your shirt looked like\n\n1:08:51.620 --> 1:08:53.660\n and what your shoes look like.\n\n1:08:53.660 --> 1:08:56.020\n And I knew exactly the height of your,\n\n1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:59.540\n the end of your pants from the top of your shoes.\n\n1:08:59.540 --> 1:09:02.060\n And so those things I don't forget.\n\n1:09:02.060 --> 1:09:04.740\n And I can remember when people,\n\n1:09:04.740 --> 1:09:06.940\n I met people two years ago and I'll say,\n\n1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:08.300\n oh yes, we met there.\n\n1:09:08.300 --> 1:09:12.300\n And I remember you had those fantastic boots on.\n\n1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:14.700\n I thought they were pretty great pair of boots.\n\n1:09:14.700 --> 1:09:15.940\n And they're like, how do you,\n\n1:09:15.940 --> 1:09:18.580\n I didn't even remember what I was wearing that day.\n\n1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:19.740\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:09:19.740 --> 1:09:21.060\n Yeah, I'm the exact same way,\n\n1:09:21.060 --> 1:09:23.500\n but you can't, until we have Neuralink\n\n1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:24.340\n or something like that,\n\n1:09:24.340 --> 1:09:26.340\n we can't communicate that you remember all those things.\n\n1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:27.940\n I know, that's what I wanted.\n\n1:09:27.940 --> 1:09:29.820\n So you have to be able to use tricks\n\n1:09:29.820 --> 1:09:31.420\n of human communication for that.\n\n1:09:31.420 --> 1:09:33.660\n But so that, I mean, that's the,\n\n1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:35.740\n it's ultimately is a trick of like,\n\n1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:37.940\n which to remember, which to forget.\n\n1:09:37.940 --> 1:09:41.060\n And the forgetting is so, it's so fascinating to say this.\n\n1:09:41.060 --> 1:09:44.500\n I mean, it seems to be deeply connected\n\n1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:46.660\n to that assimilation process.\n\n1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:50.620\n So forgetting, you try to fit all the new stuff\n\n1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:55.020\n into this big web of the old stuff\n\n1:09:55.020 --> 1:09:58.220\n and the things that don't fit, you throw out.\n\n1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:00.020\n I think the assimilation,\n\n1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:02.060\n the way I've been thinking about it with sleep\n\n1:10:02.060 --> 1:10:03.660\n and it's particularly sort of dream sleep\n\n1:10:03.660 --> 1:10:06.140\n that we think can help with this assimilation\n\n1:10:07.300 --> 1:10:09.580\n is that during wake,\n\n1:10:09.580 --> 1:10:13.540\n we have one version of associative processing.\n\n1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:14.380\n And what I mean by that\n\n1:10:14.380 --> 1:10:17.140\n is we see the most obvious connections.\n\n1:10:17.140 --> 1:10:22.140\n So I think of wakefulness as a Google search gone right.\n\n1:10:22.140 --> 1:10:27.140\n Whereas I see dream sleep as doing something very different.\n\n1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:28.500\n I think dream sleep is a little bit\n\n1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:31.100\n like group therapy for memories\n\n1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:33.500\n that everyone gets a name badge\n\n1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:36.660\n and sleep gathers in all of the individual pieces\n\n1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:39.620\n of the day and it sort of starts to get you\n\n1:10:39.620 --> 1:10:42.140\n to forces you, in fact, to speak to the people,\n\n1:10:42.140 --> 1:10:43.180\n not at the front of the room\n\n1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:45.580\n that you think you've got the most obvious connection with,\n\n1:10:45.580 --> 1:10:47.220\n but to speak with the people all the way\n\n1:10:47.220 --> 1:10:48.860\n at the back of the room that at first you think,\n\n1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:51.140\n I've got no idea what's going on in the room.\n\n1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:54.500\n You think I've got no obvious connection with them at all.\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.620\n But once you get chatting with them,\n\n1:10:56.620 --> 1:10:58.780\n you learn that you do have a very distant,\n\n1:10:58.780 --> 1:10:59.980\n non obvious connection,\n\n1:10:59.980 --> 1:11:02.740\n but it's still a connection on the same.\n\n1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:05.300\n And it's almost as though you're doing a Google search\n\n1:11:05.300 --> 1:11:08.700\n where I input Lex Friedman\n\n1:11:08.700 --> 1:11:12.140\n and it doesn't take me to the first page of your home site.\n\n1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:13.900\n It takes me to page 20,\n\n1:11:13.900 --> 1:11:16.980\n which is about some like field hockey game in Utah.\n\n1:11:16.980 --> 1:11:19.620\n It turns out that there actually is a link.\n\n1:11:19.620 --> 1:11:22.340\n If I look at it, it's a distant, non obvious one.\n\n1:11:22.340 --> 1:11:24.180\n And to me, I find that exciting\n\n1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:25.860\n because when you fuse things together\n\n1:11:25.860 --> 1:11:27.780\n that shouldn't normally go together,\n\n1:11:27.780 --> 1:11:30.100\n but when they do, they cause marked advances\n\n1:11:30.100 --> 1:11:31.580\n in evolutionary fitness.\n\n1:11:31.580 --> 1:11:34.940\n It sounds like the biological basis of creativity.\n\n1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:37.500\n And that's exactly what I think dream sleep\n\n1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:40.620\n and the algorithm of dream sleep is designed to do.\n\n1:11:40.620 --> 1:11:44.100\n It's not a Boolean like system where you have\n\n1:11:45.060 --> 1:11:49.220\n the sort of assumptions of true and false.\n\n1:11:49.220 --> 1:11:52.020\n Maybe it's more fuzzy logic system.\n\n1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:55.140\n And I think REM sleep is a perfect environment\n\n1:11:55.140 --> 1:11:58.940\n within which we do, it's almost like memory pinball.\n\n1:11:58.940 --> 1:12:02.100\n You get the information that you've learned during the day\n\n1:12:02.100 --> 1:12:03.460\n and then you pull the lever back\n\n1:12:03.460 --> 1:12:07.300\n and you shoot it up into the attic of your brain,\n\n1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:09.020\n this cortex filled with all\n\n1:12:09.020 --> 1:12:11.300\n of your past historical knowledge.\n\n1:12:11.300 --> 1:12:12.660\n And you start to bounce it around\n\n1:12:12.660 --> 1:12:14.540\n and see where one of those things lights up\n\n1:12:14.540 --> 1:12:15.780\n and you build a new connection there\n\n1:12:15.780 --> 1:12:17.500\n and you build another one there too.\n\n1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:19.780\n You're developing schemas.\n\n1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:22.340\n And so in that way, I think you could argue,\n\n1:12:23.420 --> 1:12:25.540\n we dream, therefore we are.\n\n1:12:27.060 --> 1:12:31.140\n Yeah, so in terms of this line between learning\n\n1:12:31.140 --> 1:12:33.780\n and thinking through a new thing\n\n1:12:33.780 --> 1:12:36.460\n that seems to be deeply connected,\n\n1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:40.980\n there's this legendary engineer named Jim Keller\n\n1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:42.780\n who keeps yelling at me about this.\n\n1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:44.740\n He says it's very effective.\n\n1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:49.340\n He likes to, for difficult problems before bed,\n\n1:12:49.340 --> 1:12:51.100\n think about that difficult problem.\n\n1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:52.900\n We're not talking about like drama at work\n\n1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:54.020\n or all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:12:54.020 --> 1:12:57.900\n No, like a scientific for him engineering problem.\n\n1:12:57.900 --> 1:13:01.460\n He likes to like intensely think about it\n\n1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:05.740\n to prime his mind before sleep and then go to sleep.\n\n1:13:05.740 --> 1:13:09.740\n And then he finds that the next day,\n\n1:13:09.740 --> 1:13:12.020\n he's able to think much clearer\n\n1:13:12.020 --> 1:13:13.380\n and there's new ideas that come,\n\n1:13:13.380 --> 1:13:16.820\n but also just, I guess it's more well integrated.\n\n1:13:17.980 --> 1:13:21.500\n And sometimes during the process of like,\n\n1:13:21.500 --> 1:13:26.500\n he's able to like wake up and like see new insights.\n\n1:13:26.980 --> 1:13:27.820\n That's right.\n\n1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:30.820\n If he's deeply sort of aggressively thinking through a problem.\n\n1:13:30.820 --> 1:13:35.300\n And there's many scientific demonstrations of this.\n\n1:13:35.300 --> 1:13:39.500\n The Mendeleev with the periodic table of elements,\n\n1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:42.260\n he was trying for months to understand.\n\n1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:45.860\n I mean, talk about an ecumenical problem\n\n1:13:45.860 --> 1:13:47.940\n of epic proportions.\n\n1:13:47.940 --> 1:13:49.980\n Here's your question today.\n\n1:13:49.980 --> 1:13:52.940\n You have to understand how all of the known elements\n\n1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:55.660\n in the universe fit together in a logical way.\n\n1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:57.140\n Good luck, take care.\n\n1:13:57.140 --> 1:13:58.900\n It was non trivial at the time.\n\n1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:01.700\n And he would try and try, he was so obsessed with it.\n\n1:14:01.700 --> 1:14:03.980\n He created playing cards\n\n1:14:03.980 --> 1:14:06.620\n with all of the different elements on.\n\n1:14:06.620 --> 1:14:09.340\n And then he would go on these long train journeys\n\n1:14:09.340 --> 1:14:12.740\n around Europe and he would just sort of deal these cards\n\n1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:15.180\n in front of them and he would shuffle them,\n\n1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:16.180\n shuffling and shuffling.\n\n1:14:16.180 --> 1:14:17.620\n And he would just try to see\n\n1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:20.420\n if he could find what the answer was.\n\n1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:22.660\n And then, so the story goes,\n\n1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:25.180\n he fell asleep and he had a dream.\n\n1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:26.740\n And in that dream,\n\n1:14:26.740 --> 1:14:30.460\n all of these elements started to dance and play around\n\n1:14:30.460 --> 1:14:33.140\n and they snapped into a logical grid,\n\n1:14:33.140 --> 1:14:35.700\n atomic weights, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n1:14:35.700 --> 1:14:39.020\n And it wasn't his waking brain\n\n1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:41.340\n that solved the problem.\n\n1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:42.580\n It was his sleeping brain\n\n1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:44.580\n that solved the impenetrable problem\n\n1:14:44.580 --> 1:14:46.980\n that his waking brain could not.\n\n1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:48.540\n And there's been count,\n\n1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:51.140\n even in the arts and in music,\n\n1:14:51.140 --> 1:14:52.780\n some wonderful dreams,\n\n1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:56.100\n Frankenstein, Mary Shelley's epic Gothic novel\n\n1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:59.220\n came to her in a dream at Lord Byron's home.\n\n1:15:00.460 --> 1:15:01.860\n And then we've got,\n\n1:15:03.580 --> 1:15:04.500\n Paul McCartney.\n\n1:15:06.060 --> 1:15:08.540\n Yesterday, the song came to him in a dream.\n\n1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:12.780\n He was filming, gosh, what was the movie?\n\n1:15:12.780 --> 1:15:13.860\n I don't recall it.\n\n1:15:13.860 --> 1:15:16.260\n I should be shocked because I'm from Liverpool myself.\n\n1:15:16.260 --> 1:15:21.260\n And, but he was on Wimpole Street in London and filming.\n\n1:15:21.340 --> 1:15:24.580\n And he came up with that song,\n\n1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:26.740\n the melody in his sleep,\n\n1:15:26.740 --> 1:15:28.660\n not to be outdone by the Beatles.\n\n1:15:28.660 --> 1:15:30.540\n And by the way, Let It Be\n\n1:15:30.540 --> 1:15:34.500\n also came from a dream that McCartney had.\n\n1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:38.500\n People usually give it religious overtones.\n\n1:15:38.500 --> 1:15:41.140\n Mother Mary comes to me speaking words of wisdom,\n\n1:15:41.140 --> 1:15:41.980\n let it be.\n\n1:15:42.900 --> 1:15:45.460\n If you've ever asked who Mother Mary is,\n\n1:15:45.460 --> 1:15:49.420\n it's not the biblical content.\n\n1:15:49.420 --> 1:15:51.260\n It's his mother.\n\n1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:54.300\n It's Mary McCartney.\n\n1:15:54.300 --> 1:15:57.900\n And she came to him in a dream and gifted him the song.\n\n1:15:57.900 --> 1:16:00.060\n But the best story I've heard\n\n1:16:00.060 --> 1:16:03.260\n is not to be outdone by the Beatles.\n\n1:16:03.260 --> 1:16:07.500\n The Stones, Keith Richards,\n\n1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:10.260\n who I think once was suggested it.\n\n1:16:10.260 --> 1:16:11.100\n Who was it?\n\n1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.780\n It was a comedian who was saying that\n\n1:16:13.780 --> 1:16:15.860\n in an interview with Rolling Stone,\n\n1:16:15.860 --> 1:16:17.820\n Keith Richards suggested or inferred\n\n1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:20.740\n that young kids should not do drugs.\n\n1:16:20.740 --> 1:16:22.980\n And they said, well, look,\n\n1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:26.100\n young kids can't do drugs\n\n1:16:26.100 --> 1:16:27.780\n because you've done all of the drugs.\n\n1:16:27.780 --> 1:16:29.820\n And I always thought that,\n\n1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:34.380\n but Keith Richards described he would always go to bed\n\n1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:38.540\n with his guitar and a tape recorder.\n\n1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:42.580\n And then probably who would have a whole set\n\n1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:43.900\n of other things in the bed with him.\n\n1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:47.420\n And who knows how many other people, but anyway.\n\n1:16:47.420 --> 1:16:49.780\n And then he said in his autobiography,\n\n1:16:49.780 --> 1:16:51.100\n and I'm paraphrasing here,\n\n1:16:51.100 --> 1:16:55.180\n but one morning I woke up and I realized\n\n1:16:55.180 --> 1:16:58.620\n that the tape had recorded all the way to the end.\n\n1:16:58.620 --> 1:17:02.780\n So I rewound the tape and I hit play.\n\n1:17:02.780 --> 1:17:05.980\n And there in some kind of ghostly form\n\n1:17:05.980 --> 1:17:08.860\n were the opening chords to Satisfaction,\n\n1:17:08.860 --> 1:17:11.260\n the most famous successful Rolling Stone song\n\n1:17:11.260 --> 1:17:12.500\n of all time.\n\n1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:16.220\n Followed by then 43 minutes of snoring.\n\n1:17:18.060 --> 1:17:19.060\n That's awesome.\n\n1:17:19.060 --> 1:17:20.460\n That riff came to him.\n\n1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:22.900\n One of the most famous riffs in all of rock and roll\n\n1:17:22.900 --> 1:17:25.460\n came to him by way of a dream inspired insight.\n\n1:17:25.460 --> 1:17:30.340\n So I think there is too many of those anecdotes.\n\n1:17:30.340 --> 1:17:31.420\n And we've now got the side,\n\n1:17:31.420 --> 1:17:33.940\n I don't rely on anecdotes as science.\n\n1:17:33.940 --> 1:17:35.820\n We've now done the studies in the laboratory\n\n1:17:35.820 --> 1:17:37.580\n and we can reliably demonstrate\n\n1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:39.340\n that sleep inspires creativity,\n\n1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:41.820\n inspires problem solving capacity.\n\n1:17:41.820 --> 1:17:43.100\n Well, the interesting thing is,\n\n1:17:43.100 --> 1:17:45.780\n is it possible to some of the ideas that you talk about\n\n1:17:45.780 --> 1:17:47.300\n to turn them into a protocol\n\n1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:48.940\n that could be practiced rigorously?\n\n1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:53.380\n So what Jim Keller espouses is saying,\n\n1:17:53.380 --> 1:17:56.860\n not just the fact that sleep helps you\n\n1:17:56.860 --> 1:17:58.620\n increase the creativity,\n\n1:17:58.620 --> 1:18:00.460\n but turn it into a process.\n\n1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.940\n Like literally, like don't do it accidentally.\n\n1:18:06.420 --> 1:18:08.700\n Like an athlete does certain things\n\n1:18:08.700 --> 1:18:10.180\n to optimize their performance.\n\n1:18:10.180 --> 1:18:11.460\n They have a training routine.\n\n1:18:11.460 --> 1:18:16.460\n They have a regimen of like cycling and sprints\n\n1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:18.620\n and long distance stuff.\n\n1:18:18.620 --> 1:18:22.380\n In the same way, thinking about your job\n\n1:18:22.380 --> 1:18:25.300\n as an idea generator in the engineering space\n\n1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:27.620\n is like, this is good for my performance.\n\n1:18:27.620 --> 1:18:29.860\n So like for an hour before bed,\n\n1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:32.220\n think through a problem like every night\n\n1:18:32.220 --> 1:18:36.700\n and then use sleep to work through that problem.\n\n1:18:36.700 --> 1:18:39.220\n I mean, he's the first person that I heard\n\n1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:42.700\n like of the people I really respect that do like what I do,\n\n1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:46.260\n which is like programming engineering type work,\n\n1:18:46.260 --> 1:18:50.780\n like using sleep, not accidentally, but with a purpose,\n\n1:18:50.780 --> 1:18:53.020\n like using sleep.\n\n1:18:53.020 --> 1:18:54.900\n That's just basically the difference between,\n\n1:18:54.900 --> 1:18:57.540\n as you said, a passive approach to it\n\n1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:01.900\n versus an active deterministic\n\n1:19:01.900 --> 1:19:04.020\n or hope for a deterministic approach to it.\n\n1:19:04.020 --> 1:19:08.460\n In other words, that you are actually trying to harness\n\n1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:11.380\n the power of sleep in a deliberate way\n\n1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:13.980\n rather than an unthoughtful way.\n\n1:19:13.980 --> 1:19:17.580\n I still think that mother nature through it,\n\n1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:20.260\n the 3.6 million years of evolution\n\n1:19:20.260 --> 1:19:22.580\n has probably got it mostly figured out\n\n1:19:22.580 --> 1:19:25.980\n in terms of what information should be uploaded at night\n\n1:19:25.980 --> 1:19:27.140\n and worked through.\n\n1:19:27.140 --> 1:19:31.300\n I think her algorithm is probably pretty good at this stage.\n\n1:19:31.300 --> 1:19:32.420\n It's not to suggest though,\n\n1:19:32.420 --> 1:19:35.820\n that we can't try to tweak it and nudge it.\n\n1:19:35.820 --> 1:19:39.020\n It's a very light hand on the tiller is what he's doing.\n\n1:19:39.020 --> 1:19:41.900\n I don't think there's anything wrong with that.\n\n1:19:41.900 --> 1:19:43.500\n Just like, for example, for me,\n\n1:19:43.500 --> 1:19:47.420\n fasting has improved my ability to focus deeply\n\n1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:49.740\n and productivity significantly.\n\n1:19:49.740 --> 1:19:51.500\n And in that same way,\n\n1:19:52.620 --> 1:19:55.500\n it's possible that playing with these ideas\n\n1:19:55.500 --> 1:19:57.940\n of thinking before bed or some hours before bed\n\n1:19:57.940 --> 1:20:00.300\n or some playing with different protocols\n\n1:20:00.300 --> 1:20:02.020\n will have a significant leap\n\n1:20:02.020 --> 1:20:04.300\n over what mother nature naturally does.\n\n1:20:04.300 --> 1:20:06.700\n So if you let your body do what it naturally does,\n\n1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:09.380\n you may not achieve the same level of performance\n\n1:20:09.380 --> 1:20:12.980\n because mother nature has not designed us\n\n1:20:12.980 --> 1:20:16.460\n to think deeply about chip design\n\n1:20:16.460 --> 1:20:20.540\n or programming artificial intelligence systems.\n\n1:20:20.540 --> 1:20:23.140\n Well, she's gifted us the architecture\n\n1:20:23.140 --> 1:20:25.580\n and the capacity to do that.\n\n1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:30.580\n What we do with that is what life's experience dictates.\n\n1:20:31.500 --> 1:20:34.460\n She gives us the blueprint to do many.\n\n1:20:34.460 --> 1:20:37.340\n Well, if I were to sort of introspect\n\n1:20:37.340 --> 1:20:39.900\n and self analyze what mother nature wants me to do,\n\n1:20:39.900 --> 1:20:42.780\n I think given my current lifestyle\n\n1:20:42.780 --> 1:20:45.220\n that I have food in the fridge\n\n1:20:45.220 --> 1:20:47.180\n and a bed to sleep on,\n\n1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:50.140\n I think what mother nature wants me to do is to be lazy.\n\n1:20:51.300 --> 1:20:54.700\n And so I think I'm actually resisting mother nature\n\n1:20:56.620 --> 1:20:59.580\n because so many of my needs are satisfied.\n\n1:20:59.580 --> 1:21:04.220\n And so I have to resist some of the natural forces\n\n1:21:04.220 --> 1:21:05.780\n of the body and the mind\n\n1:21:05.780 --> 1:21:07.820\n when I do some of the things I do.\n\n1:21:07.820 --> 1:21:09.420\n So there's that dance,\n\n1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:12.780\n like I've been thinking about doing a startup\n\n1:21:12.780 --> 1:21:15.220\n and that's obviously going against everything\n\n1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:18.020\n that my body and mind are telling me to do\n\n1:21:18.020 --> 1:21:21.180\n because it's going to be basically suffering.\n\n1:21:21.180 --> 1:21:22.660\n But the only reason I want...\n\n1:21:22.660 --> 1:21:24.660\n As you know, it will be over.\n\n1:21:24.660 --> 1:21:29.260\n Yes, but nevertheless,\n\n1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:31.940\n there's some kind of inner drive that wants me to do it.\n\n1:21:31.940 --> 1:21:33.700\n And then you start to ask a question,\n\n1:21:33.700 --> 1:21:36.460\n well, how do you optimize the things you can't optimize\n\n1:21:36.460 --> 1:21:38.060\n like sleep, like diet,\n\n1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:40.300\n like the people that you surround yourself with\n\n1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:43.500\n in order to maximize happiness and performance\n\n1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:47.020\n and all those kinds of things without also over optimizing.\n\n1:21:47.020 --> 1:21:52.020\n And that's such an interesting idea from a engineer.\n\n1:21:52.780 --> 1:21:55.460\n So as you may know,\n\n1:21:55.460 --> 1:21:59.540\n you don't often get those kinds of ideas from engineers.\n\n1:21:59.540 --> 1:22:04.020\n Engineers usually just don't read books about sleeping.\n\n1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:06.100\n They're usually like the...\n\n1:22:06.100 --> 1:22:10.340\n They're not the healthiest of people.\n\n1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:13.060\n I think that's changing over time,\n\n1:22:13.060 --> 1:22:14.060\n especially with Silicon Valley,\n\n1:22:14.060 --> 1:22:15.460\n especially with the tech sector.\n\n1:22:15.460 --> 1:22:18.260\n People are starting to understand what's a healthy lifestyle,\n\n1:22:18.260 --> 1:22:20.980\n but usually they're kind of on the insane side,\n\n1:22:20.980 --> 1:22:22.660\n especially programmers.\n\n1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:27.420\n But it's nice to hear somebody like that use sleep\n\n1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:29.380\n and use some of the things that you talk about\n\n1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:33.220\n strategically on purpose.\n\n1:22:33.220 --> 1:22:36.860\n When I get to that idea of not just trying to use\n\n1:22:36.860 --> 1:22:38.980\n what Mother Nature gave,\n\n1:22:38.980 --> 1:22:43.980\n but seeing if you can do something more or different,\n\n1:22:45.940 --> 1:22:47.940\n in a conservative mindset,\n\n1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:52.500\n I would then pose the question at what cost?\n\n1:22:52.500 --> 1:22:55.660\n Because when you do something perhaps\n\n1:22:55.660 --> 1:22:59.060\n that deviates from the typical pre programmed,\n\n1:22:59.060 --> 1:23:02.420\n you know, Mother Nature's program,\n\n1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:07.860\n I suspect it usually comes at the cost of something else.\n\n1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:12.420\n So maybe he is able to direct and focus\n\n1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:16.540\n his sleeping cognition on those particular topics\n\n1:23:16.540 --> 1:23:20.300\n that will gain him better problematic resolution\n\n1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:22.220\n the next day when he wakes up.\n\n1:23:22.220 --> 1:23:23.300\n The question is though,\n\n1:23:23.300 --> 1:23:26.300\n at what cost of the other things that didn't make it\n\n1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:31.300\n onto the menu of the finger buffet of sleep that night?\n\n1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:34.340\n And is it that you don't process\n\n1:23:34.340 --> 1:23:37.540\n the emotional difficulties or events,\n\n1:23:37.540 --> 1:23:41.140\n and therefore you are less emotionally resolved the next day,\n\n1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:45.340\n but you are more problem resolved the following day.\n\n1:23:45.340 --> 1:23:46.940\n And so I always try to think,\n\n1:23:46.940 --> 1:23:51.660\n and I truly don't want to sound puritanical\n\n1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:52.740\n either about sleep,\n\n1:23:52.740 --> 1:23:56.220\n and I think I've come off that way many a times,\n\n1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:58.580\n especially when I started out in the public.\n\n1:24:00.100 --> 1:24:02.300\n The tone of the book, in some ways,\n\n1:24:02.300 --> 1:24:06.300\n I look back and think, could I have been a little softer?\n\n1:24:06.300 --> 1:24:10.580\n And the reason was I was that way back in\n\n1:24:10.580 --> 1:24:11.660\n when I started writing the book,\n\n1:24:11.660 --> 1:24:15.340\n which was probably something like 2014 or 15,\n\n1:24:16.500 --> 1:24:18.620\n sleep was the neglected stepsister\n\n1:24:18.620 --> 1:24:21.460\n in the health conversation of the day.\n\n1:24:21.460 --> 1:24:25.300\n And I was just so sad to see the amount of suffering\n\n1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:27.420\n and disease and sickness that was caused\n\n1:24:27.420 --> 1:24:29.580\n by insufficient sleep.\n\n1:24:29.580 --> 1:24:33.060\n And for years before I'd been doing public speaking,\n\n1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:34.980\n and I'd tell people about the great things\n\n1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:36.260\n that happen when you get sleep.\n\n1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:37.900\n People would say, that's fascinating.\n\n1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:39.980\n And then they would go back and keep doing the same thing\n\n1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:41.740\n about not sleeping enough.\n\n1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:43.700\n And then I realized you can't really speak\n\n1:24:43.700 --> 1:24:44.820\n about the good things that happen.\n\n1:24:44.820 --> 1:24:46.980\n It's like the news, what bleeds leads.\n\n1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:49.300\n And if you speak about the alarmingly bad things\n\n1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:52.980\n that happen, people tend to have a behavioral change.\n\n1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:55.380\n And so the book as a consequence,\n\n1:24:55.380 --> 1:24:59.860\n I think probably came out a little bit on the strong side\n\n1:24:59.860 --> 1:25:03.620\n of trying to convince people.\n\n1:25:03.620 --> 1:25:05.060\n Well, you were trying to help a lot of people\n\n1:25:05.060 --> 1:25:07.740\n and that's a powerful way to help a lot of people.\n\n1:25:07.740 --> 1:25:09.500\n I was genuinely trying to help people,\n\n1:25:09.500 --> 1:25:12.100\n but certainly for some people for whom sleep\n\n1:25:12.100 --> 1:25:14.620\n does not come easy, then it was probably\n\n1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:17.500\n a tricky book to read too.\n\n1:25:17.500 --> 1:25:20.660\n And I think I feel more sensitive to those people now\n\n1:25:20.660 --> 1:25:23.060\n and empathetically connected to them.\n\n1:25:23.060 --> 1:25:27.660\n So I think the, again, the point was simply\n\n1:25:27.660 --> 1:25:32.580\n that I don't mean to sound too puritanical in all of this.\n\n1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:36.900\n And the same way with caffeine and coffee.\n\n1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:40.780\n I am just a scientist and I am not here to tell anyone\n\n1:25:40.780 --> 1:25:41.980\n how to live their life.\n\n1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:44.020\n That is not my job at all.\n\n1:25:44.020 --> 1:25:47.180\n And life is to be lived to a degree\n\n1:25:47.180 --> 1:25:51.500\n and life is to be lived if you want to do a startup.\n\n1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:54.060\n All I want to do is empower people\n\n1:25:54.060 --> 1:25:57.500\n with the understanding of the science of sleep.\n\n1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:59.340\n And then you can make an informed choice\n\n1:25:59.340 --> 1:26:00.980\n as to how you want to live your life.\n\n1:26:00.980 --> 1:26:03.580\n And I offer no judgment on how anyone\n\n1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:05.500\n wishes to live their life.\n\n1:26:05.500 --> 1:26:08.580\n I just want to try and see if the information\n\n1:26:08.580 --> 1:26:12.060\n that I have about sleep would alternatively change\n\n1:26:12.060 --> 1:26:13.740\n how you would think about your life decisions.\n\n1:26:13.740 --> 1:26:15.460\n And if it doesn't, no problem.\n\n1:26:15.460 --> 1:26:18.300\n And if it does, I hope it's been of use.\n\n1:26:18.300 --> 1:26:20.620\n Well, maybe this is me trying\n\n1:26:20.620 --> 1:26:22.900\n to justify my lifestyle to you.\n\n1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:27.460\n But Dr. Seuss said, you know you're in love\n\n1:26:27.460 --> 1:26:29.620\n when you can't fall asleep because reality\n\n1:26:29.620 --> 1:26:31.820\n is finally better than your dreams.\n\n1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:34.540\n I love that quote too.\n\n1:26:34.540 --> 1:26:35.380\n Okay.\n\n1:26:37.460 --> 1:26:41.980\n My sleeping schedule is complicated\n\n1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:45.980\n and it has to do primarily with the fact\n\n1:26:45.980 --> 1:26:49.580\n that I love basically everything that I do.\n\n1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:53.540\n And that love takes a form that may not appear\n\n1:26:53.540 --> 1:26:56.660\n to be love from the external observer perspective.\n\n1:26:56.660 --> 1:26:58.780\n Cause it's often includes struggle.\n\n1:26:58.780 --> 1:27:02.180\n It often includes something that looks like stress\n\n1:27:02.180 --> 1:27:03.780\n even though it's not stress.\n\n1:27:03.780 --> 1:27:06.940\n It's like this excitement, it's this turmoil\n\n1:27:06.940 --> 1:27:11.180\n and chaos of passion, of struggling with a problem\n\n1:27:11.180 --> 1:27:15.940\n of being sad and down to the point even depressed\n\n1:27:15.940 --> 1:27:18.620\n of how difficult the problem is, the disappointment\n\n1:27:18.620 --> 1:27:22.060\n that the last few weeks and months have been a failure\n\n1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:25.300\n and self doubt, all that mix.\n\n1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:27.140\n But I love it.\n\n1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:30.340\n And a part of that is sometimes staying up all night\n\n1:27:30.340 --> 1:27:33.220\n working on a thing I'm really passionate about.\n\n1:27:33.220 --> 1:27:36.460\n And that means sleep schedules that are just like,\n\n1:27:37.500 --> 1:27:39.860\n you know, sometimes sleeping during the day,\n\n1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:43.220\n sometimes very often sleeping very little\n\n1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:46.740\n but taking naps that are like an hour, two hours and so on.\n\n1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:48.620\n That kind of weird chaos.\n\n1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:53.620\n And now I'll also try to give myself back up.\n\n1:27:54.220 --> 1:27:56.180\n I was trying to like research yesterday\n\n1:27:56.180 --> 1:27:59.660\n is anybody else productive, wild like this?\n\n1:27:59.660 --> 1:28:02.140\n And there's of course a lot of anecdotal evidence\n\n1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:05.820\n and some of it could be just narratives\n\n1:28:05.820 --> 1:28:07.780\n that people have told to the public\n\n1:28:07.780 --> 1:28:09.860\n when in reality they sleep way more.\n\n1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:14.860\n But there's a bunch of people that are famous\n\n1:28:14.940 --> 1:28:16.340\n for not sleeping much.\n\n1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:21.340\n So on the topic of naps, I read this a long time ago\n\n1:28:21.620 --> 1:28:26.300\n and I checked this, Churchill was big on big naps.\n\n1:28:26.300 --> 1:28:28.540\n And is actually just reading more\n\n1:28:28.540 --> 1:28:31.300\n about Winston Churchill's sleep schedule\n\n1:28:31.300 --> 1:28:33.020\n is very much like mine.\n\n1:28:33.020 --> 1:28:36.900\n So I basically wanna give myself the opportunity\n\n1:28:36.900 --> 1:28:40.740\n to at night to stay up all night if I want to.\n\n1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:44.780\n And a good nap is a big part of that in the late evening.\n\n1:28:44.780 --> 1:28:48.060\n Like I'll often, this destroys social life completely\n\n1:28:48.060 --> 1:28:51.980\n but I'll often take a nap in the late afternoon\n\n1:28:51.980 --> 1:28:54.020\n or the evening and that sets me\n\n1:28:54.020 --> 1:28:56.540\n if I want to stay up all night.\n\n1:28:56.540 --> 1:29:00.620\n And things like that, that I read that Nikola Tesla\n\n1:29:00.620 --> 1:29:05.140\n slept only two hours a night, Edison the same three hours\n\n1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:07.700\n but he actually did the polyphasic sleep\n\n1:29:07.700 --> 1:29:10.260\n like where it's just a bunch of naps.\n\n1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:15.260\n What can you say about this madness of love\n\n1:29:15.860 --> 1:29:18.900\n and passion of loving everything you do\n\n1:29:18.900 --> 1:29:22.220\n and the chaos of sleep that might result in?\n\n1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:28.380\n I love the Seuss quote and I've had that experience too.\n\n1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:33.100\n Like you, I adore what I do.\n\n1:29:33.100 --> 1:29:37.700\n If someone gave you enough money\n\n1:29:37.700 --> 1:29:40.260\n to live the rest of your life,\n\n1:29:40.260 --> 1:29:43.260\n got a roof above my head, rice and beans on the table\n\n1:29:43.260 --> 1:29:45.260\n and they said, you don't have to work anymore.\n\n1:29:45.260 --> 1:29:46.900\n I would do nothing different.\n\n1:29:46.900 --> 1:29:51.900\n I would do exactly, this sounds a little crass\n\n1:29:51.940 --> 1:29:53.820\n and I hope it doesn't sound this way\n\n1:29:53.820 --> 1:30:03.180\n but being a scientist is not what I do, it's who I am.\n\n1:30:03.180 --> 1:30:08.180\n And when that's the case, sleep, working out,\n\n1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:12.460\n showering and eating are the things that I do\n\n1:30:12.460 --> 1:30:17.540\n in between my love affair with sleep.\n\n1:30:17.540 --> 1:30:19.380\n I fell for sleep like a blind roofer.\n\n1:30:19.380 --> 1:30:24.380\n And it was a love affair that started 20 years ago\n\n1:30:28.300 --> 1:30:33.100\n and I remain utterly besotted today.\n\n1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:37.420\n It's the most beguiling thing in the world to me.\n\n1:30:37.420 --> 1:30:41.540\n And I could easily and I have, it's kept me up at night.\n\n1:30:41.540 --> 1:30:44.140\n When my mind is fizzing with experimental ideas\n\n1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:47.380\n or I think I've got a new hypothesis or theory,\n\n1:30:47.380 --> 1:30:49.140\n I will struggle with sleep.\n\n1:30:49.140 --> 1:30:52.300\n I really will, it doesn't come easy to me\n\n1:30:52.300 --> 1:30:56.500\n because my mind is just so on fire with those ideas.\n\n1:30:56.500 --> 1:30:58.860\n So I understand the struggle,\n\n1:31:01.060 --> 1:31:06.060\n but I couldn't advocate from a scientific perspective,\n\n1:31:07.140 --> 1:31:09.700\n the schedule because the science just doesn't,\n\n1:31:11.020 --> 1:31:14.780\n I would feel as though I'm doing you a disservice\n\n1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:19.780\n to say it's okay, that won't come with some blast radius,\n\n1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:22.980\n some health consequences.\n\n1:31:22.980 --> 1:31:25.500\n You can add Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan\n\n1:31:25.500 --> 1:31:26.660\n to that list too.\n\n1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:30.860\n Both of them were very proud chest beaters\n\n1:31:30.860 --> 1:31:32.260\n of how little sleep that they get.\n\n1:31:32.260 --> 1:31:34.980\n Thatcher said four hours, Reagan something similar.\n\n1:31:35.820 --> 1:31:38.140\n And I, knowing the links that we now know\n\n1:31:38.140 --> 1:31:39.860\n between sleep and Alzheimer's disease,\n\n1:31:39.860 --> 1:31:42.900\n I've often wondered whether it was coincidental then\n\n1:31:42.900 --> 1:31:46.380\n that both of them died of the terrible disease of Alzheimer's\n\n1:31:46.380 --> 1:31:49.740\n meaning, maybe it doesn't get you by way of\n\n1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:52.060\n being popped out of the gene pool in a car accident\n\n1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:55.020\n because you had a microsleep at the wheel at age 32,\n\n1:31:55.020 --> 1:31:59.700\n or it doesn't get you at 42 with heart attack\n\n1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:03.780\n or even 52 with cancer or a stroke,\n\n1:32:03.780 --> 1:32:05.660\n maybe it gets you in your seventies.\n\n1:32:05.660 --> 1:32:07.740\n I think the elastic band of sleep deprivation\n\n1:32:07.740 --> 1:32:10.740\n can stretch only so far before it snaps\n\n1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:13.620\n and it ultimately seems to snap.\n\n1:32:13.620 --> 1:32:18.620\n Nicola Tesla, I think he died of a coronary thrombosis,\n\n1:32:21.700 --> 1:32:22.700\n I believe.\n\n1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:25.380\n And there was a wonderful study done out of Harvard\n\n1:32:25.380 --> 1:32:27.860\n where they took a group of people who had no signs\n\n1:32:27.860 --> 1:32:30.220\n of cardiovascular disease.\n\n1:32:30.220 --> 1:32:32.700\n And what they found is that when they track them\n\n1:32:32.700 --> 1:32:36.380\n for years afterwards, they were completely healthy\n\n1:32:36.380 --> 1:32:37.220\n to begin with.\n\n1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:40.180\n Those people who are getting less than six hours of sleep\n\n1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:43.420\n ended up having a 300% increased risk\n\n1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:46.500\n of developing calcification of the coronary artery,\n\n1:32:46.500 --> 1:32:51.420\n which is the major sort of corridor of life for your heart.\n\n1:32:51.420 --> 1:32:54.820\n When someone says, he died of a massive coronary,\n\n1:32:54.820 --> 1:32:58.380\n it's because of a blockade of the coronary artery.\n\n1:32:58.380 --> 1:33:03.380\n And Tesla passed away from a coronary thrombosis.\n\n1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:05.100\n We also know that insufficient sleep\n\n1:33:05.100 --> 1:33:07.380\n is linked to numerous mental health issues.\n\n1:33:07.380 --> 1:33:11.340\n We know that Churchill had a wicked battle with depression.\n\n1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:13.260\n Gosh, my goodness, he used to call it black dog\n\n1:33:13.260 --> 1:33:15.060\n that would come and visit him.\n\n1:33:15.060 --> 1:33:16.500\n And I think many of his paintings,\n\n1:33:16.500 --> 1:33:18.260\n he was exquisite painter,\n\n1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:20.780\n but some of them would depict his darkness\n\n1:33:20.780 --> 1:33:22.820\n with depression as well.\n\n1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:26.100\n Edison is interesting.\n\n1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:28.580\n People have argued that he would short sleep\n\n1:33:28.580 --> 1:33:30.260\n and he didn't put much value in sleep.\n\n1:33:30.260 --> 1:33:31.740\n Whether or not that's true, we don't know,\n\n1:33:31.740 --> 1:33:33.140\n but he was a habitual napper.\n\n1:33:33.140 --> 1:33:33.980\n You're right, during the day,\n\n1:33:33.980 --> 1:33:36.340\n I've got some great pictures of him on his inventor's bench\n\n1:33:36.340 --> 1:33:37.300\n taking a nap.\n\n1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:41.060\n And in fact, I believe he set up nap carts around his house\n\n1:33:41.060 --> 1:33:42.580\n so he could nap.\n\n1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:44.700\n But what we also know, a study, again,\n\n1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:47.820\n coming out of Harvard just a couple of months ago,\n\n1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:50.540\n demonstrated very clearly that polyphasic sleep\n\n1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:52.980\n is associated with worse physical outcomes,\n\n1:33:52.980 --> 1:33:54.740\n worse cognitive outcomes,\n\n1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.460\n and especially worse mood outcomes.\n\n1:33:57.460 --> 1:33:58.900\n So from that sense,\n\n1:33:58.900 --> 1:34:01.660\n sleeping like a baby is not perfect for adults.\n\n1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:05.740\n So there's a fascinating dance here\n\n1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:09.140\n of the mean and the extreme,\n\n1:34:09.140 --> 1:34:13.220\n like the average and the high performers.\n\n1:34:13.220 --> 1:34:14.060\n So I,\n\n1:34:17.940 --> 1:34:21.460\n this gets to like the meaning of life kind of discussion,\n\n1:34:21.460 --> 1:34:24.820\n but let's go that way.\n\n1:34:24.820 --> 1:34:25.940\n And also happiness.\n\n1:34:25.940 --> 1:34:29.540\n So when studying sleep and when studying anything\n\n1:34:29.540 --> 1:34:31.740\n like diet and exercise,\n\n1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:35.940\n I think you have to really get a lot more data\n\n1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:38.020\n about individuals to make\n\n1:34:40.620 --> 1:34:41.620\n conclusive statement.\n\n1:34:41.620 --> 1:34:43.580\n That's when people talk about like,\n\n1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:47.100\n is meat, red meat good for you or bad for you, right?\n\n1:34:47.100 --> 1:34:50.700\n It's just so often correlated with other life decisions\n\n1:34:50.700 --> 1:34:53.100\n when you choose to eat meat or not.\n\n1:34:53.100 --> 1:34:58.100\n My sense is that whatever life decisions you make,\n\n1:34:58.100 --> 1:35:02.620\n if they reduce stress and lead to happiness,\n\n1:35:02.620 --> 1:35:04.860\n that's also going to be a big boost\n\n1:35:04.860 --> 1:35:06.020\n that needs to be integrated\n\n1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:07.940\n into the plots in the science, right?\n\n1:35:07.940 --> 1:35:10.860\n So I'll give you an example of somebody\n\n1:35:10.860 --> 1:35:13.900\n who is unarguably seen as unhealthy.\n\n1:35:15.100 --> 1:35:17.340\n My friend, Mr. David Goggins.\n\n1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:21.660\n So he's clearly, obviously,\n\n1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.900\n almost on purpose destroying his body.\n\n1:35:23.900 --> 1:35:28.540\n He's destroying his body and to say\n\n1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:32.660\n that he's doing the wrong thing or the unhealthy thing\n\n1:35:32.660 --> 1:35:36.300\n feels like, feels wrong.\n\n1:35:38.140 --> 1:35:41.620\n But I'm not sure exactly in which way he feels wrong.\n\n1:35:41.620 --> 1:35:43.740\n One of the things I'm bothered by,\n\n1:35:43.740 --> 1:35:47.100\n and again, I apologize for the therapy sessions,\n\n1:35:48.420 --> 1:35:49.820\n a framework of this,\n\n1:35:49.820 --> 1:35:54.820\n but I'm bothered by the fact that a lot of people\n\n1:35:55.820 --> 1:35:59.660\n tell me or David that they're doing things wrong.\n\n1:36:02.220 --> 1:36:05.260\n A lot of people in my life, when they see me not sleep,\n\n1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:09.260\n they'll tell me to sleep more.\n\n1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:13.940\n Now they're correct, but one fundamental aspect\n\n1:36:13.940 --> 1:36:18.300\n that I'd like to complain about is not enough people,\n\n1:36:18.300 --> 1:36:22.420\n almost nobody, especially people that care for me,\n\n1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:24.220\n will come to me and say,\n\n1:36:25.820 --> 1:36:29.380\n you have a dream, work harder.\n\n1:36:34.660 --> 1:36:39.660\n It's like the healthy thing should be a component\n\n1:36:39.660 --> 1:36:44.420\n of a life well lived, but not everything.\n\n1:36:44.420 --> 1:36:45.820\n And I don't know what to do with that\n\n1:36:45.820 --> 1:36:48.420\n because you certainly don't want to espouse.\n\n1:36:48.420 --> 1:36:51.380\n And just like you said, when you were working in your book,\n\n1:36:51.380 --> 1:36:55.900\n there is a belief, sleep was a secondary citizen\n\n1:36:55.900 --> 1:36:59.060\n in the full spectrum of what's a healthy life.\n\n1:36:59.060 --> 1:37:02.340\n But at the same time, I'm bothered by in Silicon Valley\n\n1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:05.580\n and all these kinds of work environments\n\n1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.460\n that I get to work with, with engineers,\n\n1:37:07.460 --> 1:37:12.060\n is there's to me too much focus on work life balance.\n\n1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:16.100\n And what that usually starts meaning is like,\n\n1:37:16.100 --> 1:37:18.500\n yeah, yeah, of course, it's good to have a social life,\n\n1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:19.540\n it's good to have a family,\n\n1:37:19.540 --> 1:37:23.340\n it's good to eat well and sleep well,\n\n1:37:23.340 --> 1:37:25.460\n but we should also discover our passion.\n\n1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:30.140\n We should also give ourselves a chance\n\n1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:33.860\n to work our ass off towards a dream\n\n1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:36.940\n and make mistakes and take big risks\n\n1:37:36.940 --> 1:37:40.060\n that in the short term seem to sacrifice health.\n\n1:37:40.060 --> 1:37:42.860\n And I think to come back to how you started\n\n1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:45.340\n about David Goggins, who I've never met,\n\n1:37:45.340 --> 1:37:48.180\n but who I admire incredibly\n\n1:37:48.180 --> 1:37:50.900\n and have an immense reverence for the man.\n\n1:37:51.780 --> 1:37:53.740\n You said two things,\n\n1:37:53.740 --> 1:37:58.740\n is it wrong to do those things to yourself?\n\n1:37:59.900 --> 1:38:03.700\n And is it unhealthy to do those things to yourself?\n\n1:38:03.700 --> 1:38:07.700\n I disagree with the former and I agree with the latter.\n\n1:38:07.700 --> 1:38:10.940\n So from a health biological medicine perspective,\n\n1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:14.740\n sleeping in the way that you've described\n\n1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:16.340\n or that other people may be sleeping\n\n1:38:16.340 --> 1:38:18.100\n in terms of insufficient amounts,\n\n1:38:19.780 --> 1:38:24.340\n now to your point too about into individual differences,\n\n1:38:24.340 --> 1:38:27.140\n usually when I see a bar graph and a mean,\n\n1:38:27.140 --> 1:38:30.380\n I usually say, show me your variance.\n\n1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:32.140\n I want to see your variance.\n\n1:38:32.140 --> 1:38:35.420\n In other words, show me the distribution of that effect.\n\n1:38:35.420 --> 1:38:36.940\n How many people were below the mean?\n\n1:38:36.940 --> 1:38:39.980\n How many, is it all tightly clustered around this one thing?\n\n1:38:39.980 --> 1:38:41.620\n So it's a very robust effect\n\n1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:44.540\n or was this huge fan of effect where for some people\n\n1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:46.260\n there was no effect at all and other people\n\n1:38:46.260 --> 1:38:48.980\n there was a whopping effect and everything in between.\n\n1:38:48.980 --> 1:38:52.700\n So I don't discount into individual variability,\n\n1:38:54.300 --> 1:38:57.060\n but, and I will come back to those two points about,\n\n1:38:57.060 --> 1:38:59.580\n is it wrong and is it unhealthy in just a second?\n\n1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:00.980\n When it comes to sleep,\n\n1:39:00.980 --> 1:39:04.660\n we have found huge amounts of into individual differences\n\n1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:07.220\n in your response to a lack of sleep.\n\n1:39:07.220 --> 1:39:09.460\n But one of the fascinating things,\n\n1:39:09.460 --> 1:39:10.900\n so let's say that I take you\n\n1:39:10.900 --> 1:39:13.260\n and we're going to measure your attention,\n\n1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:16.940\n your emotion, your mood, your blood pressure,\n\n1:39:16.940 --> 1:39:19.180\n your blood sugar glucose regulation,\n\n1:39:19.180 --> 1:39:20.620\n your autonomic nervous system\n\n1:39:20.620 --> 1:39:22.380\n and your different gene expression.\n\n1:39:22.380 --> 1:39:25.740\n Let's say I'm just going to measure a whole kaleidoscope\n\n1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:28.740\n of different outcomes, brain and body.\n\n1:39:28.740 --> 1:39:31.140\n And I find that on our measure of cognition\n\n1:39:31.140 --> 1:39:33.580\n on your attentional ability to focus,\n\n1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:35.180\n you are very resilient.\n\n1:39:35.180 --> 1:39:37.100\n You just don't show any impairment at all\n\n1:39:37.100 --> 1:39:39.980\n even after being awake for 36 hours straight.\n\n1:39:40.860 --> 1:39:42.540\n Does that mean that you are resilient\n\n1:39:42.540 --> 1:39:44.580\n in all of those other domains as well?\n\n1:39:44.580 --> 1:39:46.380\n The answer is no, you're not.\n\n1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:48.820\n So you can be resilient in one,\n\n1:39:48.820 --> 1:39:51.580\n but very vulnerable in another.\n\n1:39:51.580 --> 1:39:56.100\n And we've not found anyone who isn't at least vulnerable\n\n1:39:56.100 --> 1:39:58.340\n in one of those domains,\n\n1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:02.060\n meaning that it's somewhat safe to say that\n\n1:40:02.060 --> 1:40:03.980\n not getting sufficient sleep will lead\n\n1:40:03.980 --> 1:40:07.980\n to some kind of impairment in any one given individual.\n\n1:40:07.980 --> 1:40:10.540\n It may not be the same impairment,\n\n1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:12.620\n but it's likely to be an impairment.\n\n1:40:12.620 --> 1:40:14.460\n But to come back to the question,\n\n1:40:14.460 --> 1:40:16.780\n I think it's wrong to tell anyone\n\n1:40:16.780 --> 1:40:19.300\n that it's wrong to do what they're doing,\n\n1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:21.700\n even if they are compromising their sleep,\n\n1:40:21.700 --> 1:40:24.780\n even if they're compromising their mental health.\n\n1:40:24.780 --> 1:40:28.340\n As long as they're not hurting anyone else,\n\n1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:31.020\n then I think the answer is\n\n1:40:31.020 --> 1:40:32.940\n that's that person's choice.\n\n1:40:32.940 --> 1:40:34.140\n Yeah, but that's that person's life.\n\n1:40:34.140 --> 1:40:35.540\n I'd like to push back further.\n\n1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:37.980\n So see, the way you kind of said it,\n\n1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:41.660\n yes, you're absolutely right.\n\n1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:45.380\n But I would like to say a stronger statement,\n\n1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:49.340\n which is you should let go of that judgment\n\n1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:51.220\n of somebody is wrong\n\n1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:53.140\n and allow yourself to be inspired\n\n1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:55.860\n by the great heights they have reached.\n\n1:40:55.860 --> 1:40:59.900\n So take yourself out of the seat of being a judger\n\n1:40:59.900 --> 1:41:01.380\n of what is healthy or not,\n\n1:41:01.380 --> 1:41:05.180\n and appreciate the greatness of a particular human.\n\n1:41:05.180 --> 1:41:06.940\n You watch the Olympics,\n\n1:41:06.940 --> 1:41:09.020\n the kind of things that some athletes do\n\n1:41:09.020 --> 1:41:11.700\n to reach the very heights.\n\n1:41:11.700 --> 1:41:14.940\n The Olympics are taking years off of their life.\n\n1:41:14.940 --> 1:41:18.460\n They suffer depression after the Olympics often.\n\n1:41:18.460 --> 1:41:21.020\n The physiology is disastrous.\n\n1:41:21.020 --> 1:41:22.540\n Everything, their personal life,\n\n1:41:22.540 --> 1:41:26.180\n there's their psychology, their physiology,\n\n1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:28.980\n everything, it's a giant mess.\n\n1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:31.580\n So the question is about life.\n\n1:41:32.900 --> 1:41:37.820\n Healthy now means longevity,\n\n1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:42.860\n quality of life over a prolonged period of time,\n\n1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:46.260\n optimum performance over a prolonged period of time.\n\n1:41:46.260 --> 1:41:51.260\n But to me, beauty is reaching great heights.\n\n1:41:52.220 --> 1:41:54.100\n And there's a dance there\n\n1:41:54.100 --> 1:41:56.220\n that sometimes reaching great heights\n\n1:41:56.220 --> 1:41:58.300\n requires sacrifice of health\n\n1:41:58.300 --> 1:42:01.420\n and not like a calculation\n\n1:42:01.420 --> 1:42:02.780\n where you sat down on a sheet of paper\n\n1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:05.700\n and say, I'm going to take seven years off my life\n\n1:42:05.700 --> 1:42:07.540\n for an Olympic gold medal.\n\n1:42:07.540 --> 1:42:11.020\n No, it requires more chaotic journey\n\n1:42:11.020 --> 1:42:13.300\n that doesn't do that kind of calculus.\n\n1:42:13.300 --> 1:42:15.820\n And I just want to kind of speak to the,\n\n1:42:15.820 --> 1:42:19.420\n in the culture that struggles of what is healthy and not,\n\n1:42:19.420 --> 1:42:22.820\n we want to be able to speak to what is healthy\n\n1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:26.460\n and at the same time be inspired by the great heights\n\n1:42:26.460 --> 1:42:29.900\n that humans reach no matter how healthy\n\n1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:32.700\n or unhealthy they live.\n\n1:42:32.700 --> 1:42:34.140\n Yeah, I agree with that.\n\n1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:35.500\n I think if that's a flag you're hoisting,\n\n1:42:35.500 --> 1:42:38.380\n I will definitely salute it because it really depends,\n\n1:42:38.380 --> 1:42:41.660\n what are you trying to optimize for in your life?\n\n1:42:41.660 --> 1:42:43.020\n And if you are,\n\n1:42:43.020 --> 1:42:46.380\n I think the only danger potentially with that mindset\n\n1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:50.420\n is that if you look at many of the studies\n\n1:42:50.420 --> 1:42:53.340\n of old age and end of life,\n\n1:42:53.340 --> 1:42:57.220\n most people say I never look back on my life\n\n1:42:57.220 --> 1:43:01.260\n and wish I worked harder.\n\n1:43:01.260 --> 1:43:06.260\n I wish instead I'd spent more time with family, friends\n\n1:43:06.620 --> 1:43:08.380\n and engaged in that aspect.\n\n1:43:08.380 --> 1:43:11.300\n Now I'm not saying though, coming back to your point,\n\n1:43:11.300 --> 1:43:13.820\n that that is the standard rubric for everyone.\n\n1:43:13.820 --> 1:43:15.860\n I don't believe it is too.\n\n1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:17.660\n And there are many things that you and I\n\n1:43:17.660 --> 1:43:19.580\n are both benefiting from today,\n\n1:43:19.580 --> 1:43:21.260\n even in the field of medicine,\n\n1:43:21.260 --> 1:43:26.260\n where people have sacrificed their own longevity\n\n1:43:26.420 --> 1:43:30.260\n for the quest of solving a particular medical problem.\n\n1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:36.220\n And they died quicker because of their commitment,\n\n1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:40.380\n because they wished to try and solve that problem\n\n1:43:40.380 --> 1:43:43.100\n in their pursuit of greatness scientifically.\n\n1:43:43.100 --> 1:43:44.820\n And I now benefit.\n\n1:43:44.820 --> 1:43:46.580\n Am I grateful that they did that?\n\n1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:48.460\n Incredibly grateful.\n\n1:43:48.460 --> 1:43:51.700\n You know, a simpler demonstration is this.\n\n1:43:51.700 --> 1:43:54.540\n If tonight at 4 a.m. in the morning,\n\n1:43:54.540 --> 1:43:59.540\n I have a ruptured appendix, I have an appendicitis,\n\n1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:04.580\n I am incredibly grateful that there is an emergency team\n\n1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:07.700\n that will take me to the hospital at 4 a.m. in the morning.\n\n1:44:07.700 --> 1:44:11.220\n They are awake, they're not sleeping and they save my life.\n\n1:44:12.380 --> 1:44:17.380\n And that's part of what their life's mission and quest is.\n\n1:44:17.380 --> 1:44:20.620\n And they saved another's life by, in some ways,\n\n1:44:20.620 --> 1:44:23.860\n shaving a little of their own off.\n\n1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:27.060\n So I don't take, I have no umbrage\n\n1:44:27.060 --> 1:44:29.340\n with that mentality at all.\n\n1:44:29.340 --> 1:44:30.860\n I think you just have to be very clear\n\n1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:34.060\n about what you're optimizing for.\n\n1:44:34.060 --> 1:44:39.060\n And my worry is that most people fall into the rat race\n\n1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:41.380\n and they never actually ask the question,\n\n1:44:41.380 --> 1:44:42.860\n why am I doing this?\n\n1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:47.860\n If you're just working nine to five or,\n\n1:44:47.860 --> 1:44:50.220\n and you allow that nine to five to stretch\n\n1:44:50.220 --> 1:44:53.340\n into much longer, but it's nevertheless a job\n\n1:44:53.340 --> 1:44:55.660\n that's kind of like wears you down.\n\n1:44:55.660 --> 1:44:56.540\n That's one thing.\n\n1:44:56.540 --> 1:44:59.980\n Another thing is when it is like, you're,\n\n1:44:59.980 --> 1:45:04.460\n it's a dream, it's a life mission.\n\n1:45:04.460 --> 1:45:09.140\n And for that, I think as long as you know what it is\n\n1:45:09.140 --> 1:45:11.100\n that you could be doing to yourself\n\n1:45:11.100 --> 1:45:13.620\n and you are comfortable and A okay with that,\n\n1:45:15.260 --> 1:45:17.860\n I have no problem with that at all.\n\n1:45:17.860 --> 1:45:21.700\n Again, as I said, as a scientist, I cannot, should not,\n\n1:45:21.700 --> 1:45:24.900\n and will not tell anyone what they should do with their life.\n\n1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:28.100\n All I want you to be able to do is say, okay,\n\n1:45:28.100 --> 1:45:31.700\n now I understand more about the,\n\n1:45:31.700 --> 1:45:35.860\n previously these would be known unknowns\n\n1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:38.260\n and these were the unknown unknowns.\n\n1:45:38.260 --> 1:45:41.420\n And now I am slightly more cognizant.\n\n1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:46.420\n I have more knowns than I had before\n\n1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:48.420\n regarding my sleep and my health,\n\n1:45:48.420 --> 1:45:49.940\n knowing that information,\n\n1:45:49.940 --> 1:45:53.860\n do I still choose to make this decision?\n\n1:45:53.860 --> 1:45:56.980\n And if that's what I offered,\n\n1:45:57.820 --> 1:45:59.540\n then I think I've done my job.\n\n1:45:59.540 --> 1:46:02.420\n That's all I want to offer is just added information\n\n1:46:02.420 --> 1:46:04.900\n into the decision algorithm.\n\n1:46:04.900 --> 1:46:09.260\n And what you end up choosing as an output of that algorithm\n\n1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:11.220\n has nothing to do with me.\n\n1:46:11.220 --> 1:46:14.700\n It's not my business and I will never judge anyone for it.\n\n1:46:14.700 --> 1:46:16.700\n And as I said, I'm immensely grateful for people\n\n1:46:16.700 --> 1:46:19.580\n who have sacrificed much in their lives\n\n1:46:19.580 --> 1:46:21.380\n to give me what I have.\n\n1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:23.940\n So you're saying as long as the sacrifice sort of grounded\n\n1:46:23.940 --> 1:46:27.540\n in knowledge of what the sacrifice is,\n\n1:46:27.540 --> 1:46:29.020\n that sleep is important, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:46:29.020 --> 1:46:30.260\n And that you're comfortable with it.\n\n1:46:30.260 --> 1:46:32.140\n That is, it is your conscious choice\n\n1:46:32.140 --> 1:46:34.500\n rather than feeling as though you're trapped\n\n1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:38.020\n or that you are just, you haven't thought about it.\n\n1:46:38.020 --> 1:46:41.260\n And you start that job at age 32\n\n1:46:41.260 --> 1:46:44.100\n and then you wake up the next morning and you're 65\n\n1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:45.620\n and you think, where did my life go?\n\n1:46:45.620 --> 1:46:46.940\n What was I doing?\n\n1:46:46.940 --> 1:46:49.500\n That to me, I would feel, I would want to hug you.\n\n1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.940\n And I would say, I'm just, and I'm not saying,\n\n1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:56.420\n I don't want to sound belittling here at all.\n\n1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:58.940\n I would just not wish that for you.\n\n1:46:58.940 --> 1:47:03.940\n I would wish that you could have thought about\n\n1:47:03.940 --> 1:47:06.420\n what it was that you're doing and not have that regret.\n\n1:47:06.420 --> 1:47:09.860\n Yeah, so I guess I'm, this is for you, the listener.\n\n1:47:09.860 --> 1:47:11.820\n I'm coming out of the closet here a little bit.\n\n1:47:11.820 --> 1:47:14.460\n The fact that I enjoy the madness I live in.\n\n1:47:14.460 --> 1:47:17.260\n So please do not criticize me, embrace me.\n\n1:47:17.260 --> 1:47:20.620\n I understand the sacrifices I'm making.\n\n1:47:20.620 --> 1:47:22.340\n I enjoy sleeping on the floor\n\n1:47:22.340 --> 1:47:24.820\n when I'm passionate programming all night\n\n1:47:24.820 --> 1:47:28.460\n and just pass out on the carpet.\n\n1:47:28.460 --> 1:47:29.940\n I love this life.\n\n1:47:29.940 --> 1:47:33.700\n Okay, so it's, but it's definitely something I think about\n\n1:47:33.700 --> 1:47:37.860\n that there's a balance, a strike where.\n\n1:47:37.860 --> 1:47:40.180\n I just want you to have as much of it though.\n\n1:47:40.180 --> 1:47:41.020\n Of life.\n\n1:47:44.380 --> 1:47:47.740\n See, quality of life is important.\n\n1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:50.180\n I should have said,\n\n1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:52.860\n I want you to have as much high quality life.\n\n1:47:52.860 --> 1:47:55.740\n And if high quality of life means\n\n1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:01.060\n I spend five decades on this planet,\n\n1:48:01.060 --> 1:48:04.500\n but yet in that time, I am thrilled every day.\n\n1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:07.740\n I'm turned on every day by what I do.\n\n1:48:07.740 --> 1:48:12.740\n And I reveled in this thing called my life's work.\n\n1:48:14.060 --> 1:48:17.100\n I think that that is a 50 year journey\n\n1:48:17.100 --> 1:48:21.820\n of absolute delight and fulfillment that you should take.\n\n1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:26.540\n I think about my death all the time.\n\n1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:27.820\n I meditate on death.\n\n1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:31.580\n I'm okay to die today.\n\n1:48:31.580 --> 1:48:36.580\n So to me, longevity is not a significant goal.\n\n1:48:37.340 --> 1:48:40.140\n I'm so happy to be alive.\n\n1:48:40.140 --> 1:48:43.460\n I don't even think it would suck to die today.\n\n1:48:43.460 --> 1:48:47.500\n I'm as afraid of it today as I will be in 50 years.\n\n1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:51.940\n I don't wanna die as much today as I will in 50 years.\n\n1:48:51.940 --> 1:48:55.060\n There's of course all these experiences\n\n1:48:55.060 --> 1:48:59.860\n I would like to have, but everything's already amazing.\n\n1:48:59.860 --> 1:49:01.020\n It's like that Lego movie.\n\n1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:02.900\n So I don't know.\n\n1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:06.540\n So to me, I just wanna keep doing this.\n\n1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:11.540\n And there's of course things that could affect,\n\n1:49:12.380 --> 1:49:16.860\n like you mentioned, dementia and these deterioration\n\n1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:21.140\n of the mind or the body that can significantly affect\n\n1:49:21.140 --> 1:49:23.540\n the quality of life.\n\n1:49:23.540 --> 1:49:25.220\n And so you want to do.\n\n1:49:25.220 --> 1:49:26.220\n As long as you're aware of that,\n\n1:49:26.220 --> 1:49:29.100\n and that's the price you pay for the entry\n\n1:49:29.100 --> 1:49:32.860\n into this magical kingdom that you are experiencing,\n\n1:49:32.860 --> 1:49:34.300\n which is a lovely thing.\n\n1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:37.020\n I feel privileged too.\n\n1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:38.900\n I can't believe the life that I live.\n\n1:49:38.900 --> 1:49:41.580\n It's incredible.\n\n1:49:41.580 --> 1:49:46.580\n And just like you, I think about mortality a great deal.\n\n1:49:46.700 --> 1:49:51.700\n I think a lot about death, but I don't worry about death.\n\n1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:55.660\n I probably, with the exception of the potential pain\n\n1:49:55.660 --> 1:49:58.020\n that comes before it, that some people,\n\n1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:01.740\n many people can suffer, that maybe concerns me.\n\n1:50:01.740 --> 1:50:06.620\n But I actually think about mortality as a tool,\n\n1:50:06.620 --> 1:50:11.620\n I use it as a lens through which I can then retrospect.\n\n1:50:12.260 --> 1:50:16.540\n And by placing myself at the point of future mortality,\n\n1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:20.020\n I can then use it as a retrospective lens\n\n1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:22.980\n to focus and ask the following question.\n\n1:50:22.980 --> 1:50:26.460\n Is there anything I feel I would regret\n\n1:50:26.460 --> 1:50:30.140\n and therefore change in the life that I currently have now?\n\n1:50:31.220 --> 1:50:35.740\n That's the way I meditate and use mortality as a question,\n\n1:50:35.740 --> 1:50:39.100\n is to try and course correct and focus my life.\n\n1:50:39.100 --> 1:50:41.300\n I worry not about dying,\n\n1:50:42.700 --> 1:50:44.500\n but I like to think about death\n\n1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:47.180\n as a way to prioritize my life.\n\n1:50:47.180 --> 1:50:49.060\n If that makes sense, I don't know if that makes sense.\n\n1:50:49.060 --> 1:50:52.740\n No, it makes total sense to decide\n\n1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:55.260\n how do you want to live today\n\n1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:59.020\n so that in the future you do not regret\n\n1:50:59.020 --> 1:51:00.140\n the way you've lived today.\n\n1:51:00.140 --> 1:51:02.380\n Right, and to place yourself in the future\n\n1:51:02.380 --> 1:51:06.260\n at your point of mortality is one way to, I think,\n\n1:51:06.260 --> 1:51:10.500\n as an exercise to retrospectively look back\n\n1:51:10.500 --> 1:51:13.020\n and not lose out on informed choices\n\n1:51:13.020 --> 1:51:15.420\n that you could otherwise lose out on\n\n1:51:15.420 --> 1:51:18.060\n if you weren't thinking about mortality.\n\n1:51:18.060 --> 1:51:21.020\n Yeah, it clarifies your thinking.\n\n1:51:23.220 --> 1:51:24.900\n So I mentioned I sleep on the floor,\n\n1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:28.620\n take naps and power naps, and it's just kind of madness.\n\n1:51:28.620 --> 1:51:31.860\n Is there weirdnesses to your own sleep schedule\n\n1:51:31.860 --> 1:51:35.300\n as a scientist that does incredible work,\n\n1:51:35.300 --> 1:51:37.100\n has a lot of things going on,\n\n1:51:39.340 --> 1:51:41.820\n has to lead research, has to write research,\n\n1:51:41.820 --> 1:51:44.580\n has to be a science communicator,\n\n1:51:44.580 --> 1:51:46.780\n also have a social life, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:51:46.780 --> 1:51:49.940\n Is there certain patterns to your own sleep\n\n1:51:49.940 --> 1:51:54.940\n that you regret or you participate in\n\n1:51:56.100 --> 1:51:58.420\n that you find you enjoy?\n\n1:51:59.540 --> 1:52:02.420\n Is there some personal stuff,\n\n1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:04.580\n quirks or things you're proud of\n\n1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:07.340\n that you do in terms of your sleep schedule?\n\n1:52:07.340 --> 1:52:10.580\n The funny thing about being a sleep researcher\n\n1:52:10.580 --> 1:52:13.020\n is that it doesn't make you immune\n\n1:52:13.020 --> 1:52:16.300\n to the ravages of difficult nights of sleep,\n\n1:52:16.300 --> 1:52:21.300\n and I have battled my own periods of insomnia in my life too.\n\n1:52:24.620 --> 1:52:26.900\n And I think I've been fortunate in ways\n\n1:52:26.900 --> 1:52:28.460\n because I know how sleep works\n\n1:52:28.460 --> 1:52:30.260\n and I know how to combat insomnia.\n\n1:52:30.260 --> 1:52:32.660\n I know how to get it under control\n\n1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:36.940\n because insomnia in many ways is a condition\n\n1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:40.500\n where all of a sudden your sleep controls you\n\n1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:42.540\n rather than you control your sleep.\n\n1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:46.780\n Wow, yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it, yeah.\n\n1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:51.780\n And I know when I'm starting to lose control\n\n1:52:52.060 --> 1:52:54.860\n and it's starting to take control,\n\n1:52:54.860 --> 1:52:56.860\n and I understand how to regain,\n\n1:52:57.980 --> 1:53:01.420\n but it doesn't happen overnight.\n\n1:53:01.420 --> 1:53:03.620\n It takes a long time.\n\n1:53:03.620 --> 1:53:06.780\n So you've struggled with insomnia in your life?\n\n1:53:06.780 --> 1:53:08.340\n I have, not all of my life.\n\n1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.340\n I would say I've probably had three or four\n\n1:53:10.340 --> 1:53:14.860\n really severe bouts, and all of them usually triggered\n\n1:53:14.860 --> 1:53:17.740\n by emotional circumstances, by stress.\n\n1:53:19.020 --> 1:53:22.180\n Stress that's connected to actual events in life\n\n1:53:22.180 --> 1:53:24.380\n or stress that's unexplainable?\n\n1:53:24.380 --> 1:53:26.580\n Well, externally triggered.\n\n1:53:26.580 --> 1:53:30.020\n Yeah, it's sort of what we would call reactive stress.\n\n1:53:33.100 --> 1:53:36.420\n And so that's sort of point number one\n\n1:53:36.420 --> 1:53:38.620\n about the idiosyncrasies.\n\n1:53:38.620 --> 1:53:41.140\n The point number two is that when you are having\n\n1:53:41.140 --> 1:53:44.980\n a difficult night of sleep, as a sleep researcher,\n\n1:53:44.980 --> 1:53:47.780\n you basically have become the Woody Allen neurotic\n\n1:53:47.780 --> 1:53:48.780\n of the sleep world.\n\n1:53:49.820 --> 1:53:52.980\n Because at that moment, I'm trying to fall asleep\n\n1:53:52.980 --> 1:53:54.980\n and I'm not, and I'm starting to think,\n\n1:53:54.980 --> 1:53:57.020\n okay, my dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex\n\n1:53:57.020 --> 1:53:57.900\n is not shutting down.\n\n1:53:57.900 --> 1:53:59.820\n My noradrenaline is not ramping down.\n\n1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:01.140\n My sympathetic nervous system\n\n1:54:01.140 --> 1:54:02.900\n is not giving way to my parasympathetic.\n\n1:54:02.900 --> 1:54:05.380\n At that point, you are dead in the water\n\n1:54:05.380 --> 1:54:08.100\n for the next two hours and nothing is bringing you back.\n\n1:54:08.100 --> 1:54:11.420\n So there is some irony in that too.\n\n1:54:11.420 --> 1:54:13.420\n I would say for myself though,\n\n1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:16.860\n if there is something I'm not proud of,\n\n1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:21.860\n it has been at times railing against my chronotype.\n\n1:54:23.100 --> 1:54:25.500\n So your chronotype is essentially,\n\n1:54:25.500 --> 1:54:27.300\n are you a morning type, evening type\n\n1:54:27.300 --> 1:54:28.460\n or somewhere in between?\n\n1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:32.540\n And there were times because society\n\n1:54:32.540 --> 1:54:37.020\n is desperately biased towards the morning types.\n\n1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:40.500\n This notion of the early bird catches the worm.\n\n1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:42.620\n Maybe that's true, but I'll also tell you\n\n1:54:42.620 --> 1:54:44.540\n that the second mouse gets the cheese.\n\n1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:51.180\n Yeah, so I think one of the issues around,\n\n1:54:52.300 --> 1:54:55.260\n firstly, people don't really understand chronotype\n\n1:54:55.260 --> 1:54:56.540\n because I'll have some people\n\n1:54:56.540 --> 1:54:58.060\n when I'm sort of out in the public,\n\n1:54:58.060 --> 1:55:00.140\n they'll say, look, I struggle with terrible insomnia.\n\n1:55:00.140 --> 1:55:02.300\n And I'll ask them, is it problems falling asleep\n\n1:55:02.300 --> 1:55:03.140\n or staying asleep?\n\n1:55:03.140 --> 1:55:05.100\n And they'll say, falling asleep.\n\n1:55:05.100 --> 1:55:07.860\n And then I'll say, look, if you are on a desert island\n\n1:55:07.860 --> 1:55:11.660\n with nothing to wake up for, no responsibilities,\n\n1:55:11.660 --> 1:55:13.140\n what time would you normally go to bed\n\n1:55:13.140 --> 1:55:14.260\n and what time would you wake up?\n\n1:55:14.260 --> 1:55:15.780\n And they would say, I'd probably like to go to bed\n\n1:55:15.780 --> 1:55:18.620\n about midnight and wake up maybe eight in the morning.\n\n1:55:18.620 --> 1:55:20.860\n And then I'd say, so what time do you now go to bed?\n\n1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:22.900\n And they'd say, well, I've got to be up for work early.\n\n1:55:22.900 --> 1:55:25.300\n So I get into bed at 10.\n\n1:55:25.300 --> 1:55:26.740\n I say, well, you don't have insomnia.\n\n1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:29.820\n You have a mismatch between your biological chronotype\n\n1:55:29.820 --> 1:55:31.740\n and your current sleep schedule.\n\n1:55:31.740 --> 1:55:33.580\n And when you align those two,\n\n1:55:33.580 --> 1:55:35.860\n and I was fighting that for some time too,\n\n1:55:35.860 --> 1:55:40.740\n I'm probably mostly right in the middle.\n\n1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:43.660\n I am desperately vanilla, unfortunately,\n\n1:55:43.660 --> 1:55:47.020\n in many aspects of life, but this included,\n\n1:55:47.020 --> 1:55:48.380\n I'm neither a strong morning type\n\n1:55:48.380 --> 1:55:49.900\n nor a strong evening type.\n\n1:55:49.900 --> 1:55:53.460\n So ideally I'd probably like to go to bed around 11,\n\n1:55:53.460 --> 1:55:56.860\n 10.30, 11, probably somewhere between 10.30, 11,\n\n1:55:56.860 --> 1:56:00.180\n and wake up, I naturally wake up usually most days\n\n1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:05.180\n before my alarm at 7.04, and it's 7.04\n\n1:56:05.900 --> 1:56:08.500\n because why not be idiosyncratic\n\n1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:09.340\n in terms of setting an alarm?\n\n1:56:09.340 --> 1:56:10.940\n I love it.\n\n1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:13.100\n And so I...\n\n1:56:13.100 --> 1:56:14.060\n That's kind of awesome.\n\n1:56:14.060 --> 1:56:15.020\n I've never heard about that.\n\n1:56:15.020 --> 1:56:16.140\n That's amazing.\n\n1:56:16.140 --> 1:56:17.300\n I'm gonna start doing that now,\n\n1:56:17.300 --> 1:56:20.300\n setting alarms like a little bit off the...\n\n1:56:20.300 --> 1:56:21.140\n Yeah, I know.\n\n1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:22.380\n I'm never quite sure why we all...\n\n1:56:22.380 --> 1:56:24.780\n It's a celebration of uniqueness.\n\n1:56:24.780 --> 1:56:28.780\n Yeah, and I am quite the odd snowflake in that sense too.\n\n1:56:28.780 --> 1:56:31.460\n So I would usually then try to force myself\n\n1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:33.820\n because I had that same mentality\n\n1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:38.820\n that if I wasn't up at 6.30 and in the gym by seven\n\n1:56:38.980 --> 1:56:41.740\n that there was something wrong with me.\n\n1:56:41.740 --> 1:56:44.460\n And I quickly abandoned that.\n\n1:56:44.460 --> 1:56:46.540\n But if I look back, if there was a shameful act\n\n1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:47.820\n that I have around my sleep,\n\n1:56:47.820 --> 1:56:49.820\n I think it would be that for some years\n\n1:56:49.820 --> 1:56:53.020\n until I really started to get more detailed into sleep.\n\n1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:56.500\n And now I have no shame in telling people\n\n1:56:56.500 --> 1:57:01.500\n that I will probably usually wake up around 6.45 naturally,\n\n1:57:02.420 --> 1:57:06.020\n sometimes seven when people are looking at me thinking,\n\n1:57:06.020 --> 1:57:07.860\n you're a sloth, you're lazy.\n\n1:57:08.740 --> 1:57:12.620\n And I don't finish my daily workout\n\n1:57:12.620 --> 1:57:16.900\n until I'm not working until probably nine o clock\n\n1:57:16.900 --> 1:57:19.420\n in the morning thinking, what are you doing?\n\n1:57:19.420 --> 1:57:22.860\n Now I will work late into the day.\n\n1:57:22.860 --> 1:57:25.420\n If I could, I would work 16 hours.\n\n1:57:25.420 --> 1:57:27.220\n It's my passion just like yours.\n\n1:57:29.380 --> 1:57:31.860\n So I don't feel shame around that,\n\n1:57:31.860 --> 1:57:34.340\n but I have changed my mentality around that.\n\n1:57:35.420 --> 1:57:40.420\n It's complicated because I'm probably happiest\n\n1:57:42.100 --> 1:57:45.820\n going to bed, if I'm being honest, like at 5 a.m.\n\n1:57:45.820 --> 1:57:46.660\n That's fine.\n\n1:57:46.660 --> 1:57:48.100\n You're just an extreme evening type.\n\n1:57:48.100 --> 1:57:53.100\n But the problem is it's not that I'm ashamed for it.\n\n1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:56.500\n I actually kind of enjoy it because I get to sleep\n\n1:57:56.500 --> 1:57:59.620\n through all the nonsense of like the morning.\n\n1:57:59.620 --> 1:58:01.140\n Isn't that a beautiful thing?\n\n1:58:01.140 --> 1:58:03.220\n Like people are busy with their emails\n\n1:58:03.220 --> 1:58:06.300\n and I just am happy as a cow.\n\n1:58:06.300 --> 1:58:09.900\n And I wake up after all the drama has been resolved.\n\n1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:12.260\n And cows are happy and the drama has been resolved.\n\n1:58:12.260 --> 1:58:13.420\n Exactly.\n\n1:58:13.420 --> 1:58:16.060\n But in society you do, especially,\n\n1:58:16.060 --> 1:58:17.860\n I mean this is what I think about is\n\n1:58:19.220 --> 1:58:20.980\n when you work on a larger team,\n\n1:58:20.980 --> 1:58:23.940\n especially with companies, you are,\n\n1:58:25.060 --> 1:58:26.740\n everybody's awake at the same time.\n\n1:58:26.740 --> 1:58:29.620\n So that's definitely been a struggle\n\n1:58:29.620 --> 1:58:32.860\n to try to figure out, just like you said,\n\n1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:35.460\n how to balance that, how to fit into society\n\n1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:38.500\n and yet be optimal for your chronotype, you said.\n\n1:58:38.500 --> 1:58:42.060\n Yeah, you have to sleep in synchrony with it and harmony.\n\n1:58:42.900 --> 1:58:47.500\n Because normally what we know is that if you fight biology,\n\n1:58:47.500 --> 1:58:48.860\n you'll normally lose.\n\n1:58:48.860 --> 1:58:51.420\n And the way you know you've lost is through disease\n\n1:58:51.420 --> 1:58:52.980\n and sickness.\n\n1:58:52.980 --> 1:58:56.500\n You said you suffered through several bouts of insomnia.\n\n1:58:57.460 --> 1:59:02.420\n Is there, aside from embracing your chronotype,\n\n1:59:02.420 --> 1:59:05.900\n is there advice you can give how to overcome insomnia\n\n1:59:05.900 --> 1:59:07.740\n from your own experience?\n\n1:59:07.740 --> 1:59:09.620\n Right now the best method that we have\n\n1:59:09.620 --> 1:59:11.780\n is something called cognitive behavioral therapy\n\n1:59:11.780 --> 1:59:14.980\n for insomnia or CBTI for short.\n\n1:59:14.980 --> 1:59:18.700\n And you work with, for people who don't know what it is,\n\n1:59:18.700 --> 1:59:21.340\n you work with a therapist for maybe six weeks\n\n1:59:21.340 --> 1:59:22.700\n and you can do it online, by the way,\n\n1:59:22.700 --> 1:59:25.780\n I recommend probably jumping online, it's just the easiest.\n\n1:59:26.700 --> 1:59:31.060\n And it will change your beliefs, your habits,\n\n1:59:31.060 --> 1:59:33.020\n your behaviors and your general stress\n\n1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:34.740\n around this thing called sleep.\n\n1:59:34.740 --> 1:59:36.660\n And it is just as effective as sleeping pills\n\n1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:38.020\n in the short term.\n\n1:59:38.020 --> 1:59:40.460\n But what's great is that unlike sleeping pills,\n\n1:59:40.460 --> 1:59:43.060\n when you stop working with your therapist,\n\n1:59:43.060 --> 1:59:45.740\n those benefits last for years later.\n\n1:59:45.740 --> 1:59:47.260\n Whereas when you stop your sleeping pills,\n\n1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:49.460\n you typically have what's called rebound insomnia,\n\n1:59:49.460 --> 1:59:51.100\n where your sleep not only goes back to being\n\n1:59:51.100 --> 1:59:54.340\n as bad as it was before, it's usually even worse.\n\n1:59:55.300 --> 1:59:59.580\n For me, I think I found a number of things effective.\n\n2:00:00.660 --> 2:00:02.580\n The first is that I had to really address\n\n2:00:02.580 --> 2:00:06.780\n what was stressful and try to come up with\n\n2:00:06.780 --> 2:00:11.580\n some degree of meaningful rationality around it.\n\n2:00:11.580 --> 2:00:13.620\n Because I think one of the things that happens,\n\n2:00:13.620 --> 2:00:15.860\n there's something very, talking about conscious states,\n\n2:00:15.860 --> 2:00:19.540\n to come all the way back to, gosh, I don't know,\n\n2:00:19.540 --> 2:00:21.740\n I feel like we've only been chatting for like 20 minutes,\n\n2:00:21.740 --> 2:00:23.340\n but you're gonna tell me it's been a while.\n\n2:00:23.340 --> 2:00:24.380\n Yeah, it's been a while.\n\n2:00:24.380 --> 2:00:27.980\n Okay, I'm desperately, I feel terribly sorry.\n\n2:00:27.980 --> 2:00:29.420\n But let's come back to conscious states,\n\n2:00:29.420 --> 2:00:31.300\n which is where we started.\n\n2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:36.380\n There is something very strange about the night\n\n2:00:36.380 --> 2:00:41.340\n that thoughts and anxieties are not the same\n\n2:00:41.340 --> 2:00:43.380\n as they are in the waking day.\n\n2:00:43.380 --> 2:00:45.780\n They are worse, they are bigger.\n\n2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:49.460\n And I at least find that I am far\n\n2:00:51.900 --> 2:00:56.860\n more likely to catastrophize and ruminate\n\n2:00:56.860 --> 2:00:59.540\n at night about things that when I wake up the next day\n\n2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:01.300\n in the broad light of day,\n\n2:01:01.300 --> 2:01:03.940\n I think it's nowhere near that bad, man.\n\n2:01:03.940 --> 2:01:04.860\n What were you doing?\n\n2:01:04.860 --> 2:01:06.860\n It's not that bad at all.\n\n2:01:06.860 --> 2:01:10.380\n So to gain firstly, some rational understanding\n\n2:01:10.380 --> 2:01:14.220\n of my emotional state that's causing that insomnia\n\n2:01:14.220 --> 2:01:15.660\n was very helpful.\n\n2:01:15.660 --> 2:01:18.900\n The second thing was to keep regularity,\n\n2:01:18.900 --> 2:01:21.260\n just going to bed at the same time waking up.\n\n2:01:21.260 --> 2:01:25.340\n And here's an unconventional piece of sleep advice.\n\n2:01:25.340 --> 2:01:30.340\n After a bad night of sleep, do nothing.\n\n2:01:31.820 --> 2:01:36.820\n Don't wake up any later, don't go to bed any earlier,\n\n2:01:37.220 --> 2:01:39.620\n don't nap during the day,\n\n2:01:39.620 --> 2:01:42.500\n and don't drink any more coffee than you would otherwise.\n\n2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:47.140\n Because if you end up sleeping later into the morning,\n\n2:01:47.140 --> 2:01:49.420\n you're then not going to be tired\n\n2:01:49.420 --> 2:01:51.020\n at your normal time at night.\n\n2:01:51.020 --> 2:01:53.180\n So then you're gonna get into bed thinking,\n\n2:01:53.180 --> 2:01:55.060\n well, I had a terrible night of sleep last night.\n\n2:01:55.060 --> 2:01:58.780\n And yes, I slept in this morning to try and compensate,\n\n2:01:58.780 --> 2:02:00.900\n but I'm still gonna get to bed at my normal time.\n\n2:02:00.900 --> 2:02:03.580\n But now you get into bed and you haven't been awake\n\n2:02:03.580 --> 2:02:05.380\n for as long as you normally would.\n\n2:02:05.380 --> 2:02:07.660\n So you're not as sleepy as you normally would be.\n\n2:02:07.660 --> 2:02:10.260\n And so now you sit there lying in bed\n\n2:02:10.260 --> 2:02:12.100\n and it's another bad night.\n\n2:02:12.100 --> 2:02:15.900\n And the same thing is, if you go to bed any earlier,\n\n2:02:15.900 --> 2:02:20.020\n so don't wake up any later, wake up at the same time,\n\n2:02:20.020 --> 2:02:21.540\n don't go to bed any earlier,\n\n2:02:21.540 --> 2:02:23.740\n because then you're just probably your chronotype,\n\n2:02:23.740 --> 2:02:26.500\n your biological rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep.\n\n2:02:26.500 --> 2:02:28.940\n And you think, well, it's a terrible night,\n\n2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:31.020\n I'm gonna get into bed at 9 p.m.\n\n2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:32.540\n rather than my standard 10,\n\n2:02:32.540 --> 2:02:35.220\n I'm just gonna be lying in bed awake for that hour.\n\n2:02:35.220 --> 2:02:37.300\n Naps will take our double edged sword,\n\n2:02:37.300 --> 2:02:38.580\n they can have wonderful benefits.\n\n2:02:38.580 --> 2:02:40.420\n And we've done lots of studies on naps\n\n2:02:40.420 --> 2:02:42.060\n for both the brain and the body.\n\n2:02:42.060 --> 2:02:45.380\n But they are a double edged sword in the sense that\n\n2:02:45.380 --> 2:02:49.900\n napping will just take the edge off your sleepiness.\n\n2:02:49.900 --> 2:02:52.060\n It's a little bit like a valve on a pressure cooker.\n\n2:02:52.060 --> 2:02:54.100\n When you nap during the day,\n\n2:02:54.100 --> 2:02:56.660\n you can take some of that healthy sleepiness\n\n2:02:56.660 --> 2:02:58.940\n that you've been building up during the day.\n\n2:02:58.940 --> 2:03:00.700\n And for some people, not all people,\n\n2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:02.620\n but for some people that can then make it harder\n\n2:03:02.620 --> 2:03:04.060\n for them to fall asleep at night\n\n2:03:04.060 --> 2:03:07.140\n and then stay asleep soundly across the night.\n\n2:03:07.140 --> 2:03:08.260\n So the advice would be,\n\n2:03:08.260 --> 2:03:10.060\n if you're struggling with sleep at night,\n\n2:03:10.060 --> 2:03:12.060\n don't nap during the day.\n\n2:03:12.060 --> 2:03:14.540\n But if you are not struggling with sleep,\n\n2:03:14.540 --> 2:03:17.700\n and you can nap regularly, naps are just fine.\n\n2:03:17.700 --> 2:03:20.180\n And we can play around with optimal durations\n\n2:03:20.180 --> 2:03:21.580\n depending on what you want.\n\n2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:23.740\n Just try not to nap too late into the day\n\n2:03:23.740 --> 2:03:25.220\n because napping late into the day\n\n2:03:25.220 --> 2:03:27.380\n is like snacking before your main meal.\n\n2:03:27.380 --> 2:03:30.380\n It just takes the edge off your sleep hunger as it were.\n\n2:03:30.380 --> 2:03:34.260\n But that would be, so that's my unconventional\n\n2:03:34.260 --> 2:03:37.180\n second piece of advice regarding insomnia.\n\n2:03:37.180 --> 2:03:39.020\n The third is meditation.\n\n2:03:39.020 --> 2:03:41.260\n I found meditation to be incredibly powerful.\n\n2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:43.940\n I started reading about meditation\n\n2:03:43.940 --> 2:03:48.940\n as I was researching that aspect of the book many years ago.\n\n2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:51.060\n And as a hard nose scientist,\n\n2:03:51.060 --> 2:03:53.700\n I thought this sounds very woo woo.\n\n2:03:53.700 --> 2:03:57.340\n This is sort of, we all hold hands and sing come by hour\n\n2:03:57.340 --> 2:03:59.420\n and everything's going to be fine with sleep.\n\n2:03:59.420 --> 2:04:02.660\n I read the data and it was compelling.\n\n2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:04.260\n I couldn't ignore it.\n\n2:04:04.260 --> 2:04:08.140\n And I started meditating and that was six years ago\n\n2:04:08.140 --> 2:04:09.660\n and I haven't stopped.\n\n2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:14.260\n And I find meditation before bed incredibly powerful.\n\n2:04:14.260 --> 2:04:17.500\n The meditation app companies were perplexed at this at first.\n\n2:04:17.500 --> 2:04:19.420\n They want people to meditate during the day.\n\n2:04:19.420 --> 2:04:21.700\n But when they looked at their usage statistics,\n\n2:04:21.700 --> 2:04:23.500\n they found that they would have people\n\n2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:24.980\n in the morning meditating.\n\n2:04:24.980 --> 2:04:26.900\n And then there's a huge number of people\n\n2:04:26.900 --> 2:04:28.940\n using the meditation app in the evening.\n\n2:04:28.940 --> 2:04:32.500\n What they were doing was self medicating their insomnia.\n\n2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:34.940\n And they finally, rather than railing against it,\n\n2:04:34.940 --> 2:04:39.660\n they started to see it as a cash cow, rightly so.\n\n2:04:39.660 --> 2:04:41.820\n So I found meditation to be helpful.\n\n2:04:41.820 --> 2:04:43.380\n Having a wind down routine\n\n2:04:43.380 --> 2:04:45.820\n is the other thing that's critical for me.\n\n2:04:45.820 --> 2:04:47.500\n I can't just go from,\n\n2:04:47.500 --> 2:04:49.140\n because when my mind is switched on\n\n2:04:49.140 --> 2:04:51.540\n and I think you may be like this too,\n\n2:04:51.540 --> 2:04:55.700\n if I get into bed, that Rolodex of thoughts\n\n2:04:55.700 --> 2:04:59.980\n and information and excitement and anxiety and worry\n\n2:04:59.980 --> 2:05:02.620\n is just whirling away.\n\n2:05:02.620 --> 2:05:05.220\n And it's not gonna be a good night for me.\n\n2:05:05.220 --> 2:05:07.580\n So I have to find a wind down routine.\n\n2:05:07.580 --> 2:05:10.540\n And that makes sense when you realize what sleep is like.\n\n2:05:10.540 --> 2:05:12.260\n Sleep is not like a light switch.\n\n2:05:14.060 --> 2:05:16.980\n Sleep is much more like trying to land a plane.\n\n2:05:16.980 --> 2:05:19.260\n You know, it takes time to descend down\n\n2:05:19.260 --> 2:05:23.260\n onto the terra firma that we call sound sleep at night.\n\n2:05:23.260 --> 2:05:24.780\n And we have this for kids.\n\n2:05:24.780 --> 2:05:26.660\n You know, I don't have children,\n\n2:05:26.660 --> 2:05:29.460\n but you know, a lot of parents will say,\n\n2:05:29.460 --> 2:05:33.380\n you know, we have to have the bedroom,\n\n2:05:33.380 --> 2:05:35.060\n sorry, the bedtime routine.\n\n2:05:35.060 --> 2:05:37.540\n You know, you bathe the kid, you put them in bed,\n\n2:05:37.540 --> 2:05:38.820\n you read them a story.\n\n2:05:38.820 --> 2:05:40.500\n You have to go through this routine,\n\n2:05:40.500 --> 2:05:42.340\n this wind down routine for them.\n\n2:05:42.340 --> 2:05:44.460\n And then they fall asleep wonderfully.\n\n2:05:44.460 --> 2:05:46.700\n Why do we abandon that?\n\n2:05:46.700 --> 2:05:51.380\n As adults, we need that same wind down routine.\n\n2:05:51.380 --> 2:05:53.180\n So that's been the other thing\n\n2:05:53.180 --> 2:05:54.620\n that's been very helpful to me.\n\n2:05:54.620 --> 2:05:57.140\n So don't do anything different.\n\n2:05:57.140 --> 2:05:58.780\n If you have a bad night of sleep,\n\n2:05:58.780 --> 2:06:00.980\n keep doing the same thing.\n\n2:06:00.980 --> 2:06:04.060\n Manage your anxiety, understand it, rationalize it.\n\n2:06:05.380 --> 2:06:09.100\n Then meditation, and then finally having\n\n2:06:09.100 --> 2:06:11.940\n some kind of disengagement wind down routine.\n\n2:06:11.940 --> 2:06:15.580\n Those are the four things that have been very helpful to me.\n\n2:06:15.580 --> 2:06:16.420\n That's brilliant.\n\n2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:20.580\n So the regularities really do a lot of work against insomnia.\n\n2:06:20.580 --> 2:06:21.420\n Is there,\n\n2:06:21.420 --> 2:06:26.420\n is it possible to have a healthy sleep life\n\n2:06:28.700 --> 2:06:30.980\n without the regularities?\n\n2:06:30.980 --> 2:06:34.780\n I say that because I'm all over the place\n\n2:06:34.780 --> 2:06:37.180\n and I've gotten good at being all over the place.\n\n2:06:38.060 --> 2:06:40.700\n So I'll often, like what happens,\n\n2:06:40.700 --> 2:06:42.100\n I'll go stretches of time.\n\n2:06:42.100 --> 2:06:44.660\n There'll be sometimes a month where I,\n\n2:06:44.660 --> 2:06:47.540\n my days are like, this is embarrassing to admit,\n\n2:06:47.540 --> 2:06:49.180\n but they're like,\n\n2:06:49.180 --> 2:06:51.740\n just you and I here, just you and I.\n\n2:06:51.740 --> 2:06:55.100\n It's like 28 hours or 30 hour days.\n\n2:06:55.100 --> 2:06:58.540\n Like I'll just go all the way around\n\n2:06:58.540 --> 2:07:00.780\n comfortably and happily, I love it.\n\n2:07:00.780 --> 2:07:02.380\n And then there'll be a nap.\n\n2:07:02.380 --> 2:07:05.300\n I mean, if you like add up the hours\n\n2:07:05.300 --> 2:07:08.980\n when I'm just like sleeping as much as I want,\n\n2:07:08.980 --> 2:07:12.740\n it'd probably be like six hour average per 24 hours.\n\n2:07:12.740 --> 2:07:16.660\n Like that kind of, so it works out nicely,\n\n2:07:16.660 --> 2:07:18.460\n maybe even seven hours, I don't know.\n\n2:07:18.460 --> 2:07:21.500\n But that it's obviously irregular\n\n2:07:21.500 --> 2:07:23.620\n and there's chaos in the whole thing.\n\n2:07:23.620 --> 2:07:25.380\n Like sometimes it's shorter sleep,\n\n2:07:25.380 --> 2:07:26.700\n sometimes it's longer.\n\n2:07:26.700 --> 2:07:31.220\n Is that totally not a good thing, do you think?\n\n2:07:31.220 --> 2:07:34.060\n The best evidence that we have to speak to this question\n\n2:07:34.060 --> 2:07:36.340\n is people who are doing rotating shifts.\n\n2:07:37.580 --> 2:07:41.940\n And unfortunately the news is not good.\n\n2:07:41.940 --> 2:07:45.780\n They usually have a higher instance of many diseases\n\n2:07:45.780 --> 2:07:50.740\n such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease,\n\n2:07:50.740 --> 2:07:54.020\n obesity, stroke.\n\n2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:59.020\n And again, that's just me communicating the data\n\n2:08:04.060 --> 2:08:06.500\n that we have and I'm not telling you\n\n2:08:06.500 --> 2:08:08.780\n that you should do anything different.\n\n2:08:08.780 --> 2:08:13.220\n The other thing is that there's nothing in your biology\n\n2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:16.460\n that suggests that that's how your body was designed\n\n2:08:16.460 --> 2:08:17.300\n to sleep.\n\n2:08:18.180 --> 2:08:22.020\n It is a system that loves habit.\n\n2:08:22.020 --> 2:08:27.020\n You know, if your circadian clock in your brain,\n\n2:08:27.860 --> 2:08:30.820\n it's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,\n\n2:08:30.820 --> 2:08:33.820\n sits in the middle of your brain, had a personality trait,\n\n2:08:33.820 --> 2:08:36.460\n it would be a creature of habit.\n\n2:08:36.460 --> 2:08:38.340\n It loves habit.\n\n2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:42.100\n That's how your biology is designed to work\n\n2:08:42.100 --> 2:08:47.100\n is through very archetypal prototypical expected cycles.\n\n2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:52.460\n And when we do something different to that,\n\n2:08:52.460 --> 2:08:57.340\n then you start to see some of the pressure stress fractures\n\n2:08:57.340 --> 2:08:58.780\n in the system.\n\n2:08:58.780 --> 2:09:02.540\n But again, to your point, if that's something\n\n2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:06.940\n that you don't mind, you know, adopting and understanding\n\n2:09:06.940 --> 2:09:11.820\n and then I think you should keep doing\n\n2:09:11.820 --> 2:09:12.660\n what you're doing.\n\n2:09:12.660 --> 2:09:13.540\n Yeah, it's complicated.\n\n2:09:13.540 --> 2:09:15.340\n Of course you have to be a student of your own body\n\n2:09:15.340 --> 2:09:16.220\n and explore it.\n\n2:09:16.220 --> 2:09:18.460\n One of the reasons I want to have kids\n\n2:09:19.860 --> 2:09:22.500\n is kids enforce a stricter schedule.\n\n2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:28.540\n I think I definitely feel that I'm not living\n\n2:09:29.700 --> 2:09:33.660\n the sort of data wise, scientifically speaking,\n\n2:09:33.660 --> 2:09:34.980\n the optimal life.\n\n2:09:34.980 --> 2:09:37.940\n And me just living the way I want to live day to day\n\n2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:40.020\n is perhaps not the optimal way.\n\n2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:41.940\n And there's certain things that I've seen\n\n2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:45.660\n very successful people that I know in my life\n\n2:09:45.660 --> 2:09:48.460\n when they get, when they have kids,\n\n2:09:48.460 --> 2:09:50.460\n they actually, the productivity goes up,\n\n2:09:50.460 --> 2:09:51.620\n they get their shit together.\n\n2:09:51.620 --> 2:09:55.460\n There's a lot of aspects that, yeah, the regularity.\n\n2:09:55.460 --> 2:09:56.820\n I mean, that creatures a habit.\n\n2:09:56.820 --> 2:09:58.860\n That's the thing that's power.\n\n2:09:58.860 --> 2:10:01.500\n And then you start to optimally use the hours\n\n2:10:01.500 --> 2:10:02.700\n that you have in the day.\n\n2:10:02.700 --> 2:10:03.540\n Let me ask you about that.\n\n2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:06.460\n Well, actually, I just have one quick point on that too.\n\n2:10:06.460 --> 2:10:11.460\n You know, we often think about sleep as a cost,\n\n2:10:14.220 --> 2:10:17.260\n but instead I think of sleep as an investment.\n\n2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:20.660\n And the reason is because your effectiveness\n\n2:10:20.660 --> 2:10:23.100\n and your efficiency when you're well slept\n\n2:10:24.060 --> 2:10:26.180\n typically exceeds that when you're not.\n\n2:10:27.060 --> 2:10:29.940\n And to me, it's the idea of if I'm going to boil\n\n2:10:29.940 --> 2:10:34.940\n a pot of water, why would I boil it on medium\n\n2:10:34.940 --> 2:10:37.420\n when I could boil it in half the time on high?\n\n2:10:39.060 --> 2:10:43.140\n And I sometimes worry that when I speak\n\n2:10:43.140 --> 2:10:46.700\n to Fortune 500 companies and they're of this mentality\n\n2:10:46.700 --> 2:10:51.220\n of longer hours, getting people to rise and grind,\n\n2:10:52.380 --> 2:10:55.700\n the first point is that after about 20 hours of being awake,\n\n2:10:55.700 --> 2:10:58.260\n a human being is as cognitively as impaired\n\n2:10:58.260 --> 2:11:01.260\n as they would be if they were legally drunk.\n\n2:11:01.260 --> 2:11:03.500\n And the reason I bring that point up\n\n2:11:03.500 --> 2:11:07.940\n is because I don't know any company or CEO\n\n2:11:07.940 --> 2:11:10.460\n who would say, I've got this great team,\n\n2:11:10.460 --> 2:11:11.660\n they're drunk all the time.\n\n2:11:12.780 --> 2:11:15.900\n But we often lord the airport warrior\n\n2:11:15.900 --> 2:11:18.940\n who's flown through three different time zones\n\n2:11:18.940 --> 2:11:21.540\n in the past two days, is on email at 2 a.m.\n\n2:11:21.540 --> 2:11:24.300\n and then is in the office at six.\n\n2:11:25.420 --> 2:11:28.580\n And I think there is some aspect, not in all people,\n\n2:11:28.580 --> 2:11:29.980\n but there is sort of some aspect\n\n2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:32.620\n of that slight sleep machismo.\n\n2:11:32.620 --> 2:11:36.900\n And that's not what you are very different.\n\n2:11:36.900 --> 2:11:40.420\n You are driven by a purity of passion\n\n2:11:40.420 --> 2:11:44.140\n and a very authentic, incredibly genuine goal\n\n2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:48.140\n of wanting to do something remarkable with your life.\n\n2:11:48.140 --> 2:11:51.540\n That's not the issue I think I'm speaking about.\n\n2:11:52.740 --> 2:11:55.060\n It's just simply that I think\n\n2:11:55.060 --> 2:12:00.060\n maybe this notion of wanting to be awake for longer\n\n2:12:02.900 --> 2:12:06.820\n to try and get more done can sometimes be at odds\n\n2:12:06.820 --> 2:12:11.260\n with the fact that you can actually get so much more done\n\n2:12:11.260 --> 2:12:12.660\n if you're well slept.\n\n2:12:12.660 --> 2:12:14.460\n And it's this trade off.\n\n2:12:14.460 --> 2:12:17.660\n I actually admire people that take the big risk\n\n2:12:17.660 --> 2:12:20.260\n and work hard, whether that means staying up late at night,\n\n2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:21.900\n all those kinds of things,\n\n2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:24.340\n but it cannot be in the framework,\n\n2:12:24.340 --> 2:12:26.100\n in the context like what Edison said,\n\n2:12:26.100 --> 2:12:28.700\n which is sleep feels like a waste of time.\n\n2:12:29.900 --> 2:12:32.580\n So if you're not sleeping\n\n2:12:32.580 --> 2:12:36.500\n because you think sleep is stupid, that's totally wrong.\n\n2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:37.780\n But if you're not sleeping\n\n2:12:37.780 --> 2:12:39.820\n because you're deeply passionate about something,\n\n2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:43.380\n that to me, it's a gray area, of course,\n\n2:12:43.380 --> 2:12:45.220\n but that to me is much more admirable.\n\n2:12:45.220 --> 2:12:48.260\n And everything you're espousing is saying\n\n2:12:48.260 --> 2:12:49.620\n whatever the hell you're doing,\n\n2:12:49.620 --> 2:12:51.660\n you better be aware that sleep,\n\n2:12:51.660 --> 2:12:54.660\n long term and short term is really good for you.\n\n2:12:54.660 --> 2:12:57.220\n So if you're not sleeping, you're sacrificing,\n\n2:12:57.220 --> 2:13:00.060\n just make sure you're sacrificing for the right thing.\n\n2:13:00.060 --> 2:13:04.020\n I see vodka and getting drunk the same way.\n\n2:13:04.020 --> 2:13:05.500\n I know it's not good for me.\n\n2:13:05.500 --> 2:13:08.460\n I know I'm not gonna feel good days after.\n\n2:13:08.460 --> 2:13:10.340\n I know it's gonna decrease my performance.\n\n2:13:10.340 --> 2:13:12.780\n And there's nothing positive about it,\n\n2:13:12.780 --> 2:13:17.500\n except it introduces chaos in my life\n\n2:13:17.500 --> 2:13:20.300\n that introduces beautiful experiences\n\n2:13:20.300 --> 2:13:22.100\n that I would not otherwise have.\n\n2:13:22.100 --> 2:13:27.100\n It creates this turmoil of social interaction\n\n2:13:27.500 --> 2:13:29.780\n that ultimately makes me happy\n\n2:13:29.780 --> 2:13:31.900\n that I've experienced them in the moment\n\n2:13:31.900 --> 2:13:34.580\n and later the stories, you get to meet new people.\n\n2:13:34.580 --> 2:13:36.580\n It's like alcohol in this society\n\n2:13:36.580 --> 2:13:40.340\n is an incredible facilitator of that.\n\n2:13:40.340 --> 2:13:43.980\n So that's a good example of not sleeping\n\n2:13:43.980 --> 2:13:46.380\n and drinking way too much vodka.\n\n2:13:46.380 --> 2:13:51.380\n Again, it's this notion of life is to be lived to a degree.\n\n2:13:51.740 --> 2:13:54.500\n But if you do have children,\n\n2:13:55.780 --> 2:13:56.820\n I think one of the other things\n\n2:13:56.820 --> 2:13:58.660\n that then maybe comes into the picture\n\n2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:03.380\n is the fact that now there are other people\n\n2:14:03.380 --> 2:14:06.700\n that you have to live for than yourself.\n\n2:14:07.620 --> 2:14:10.740\n Yeah, but come on, like once they're old enough,\n\n2:14:10.740 --> 2:14:13.580\n like if you can't defend for yourself,\n\n2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:15.620\n you're too weak, get stronger.\n\n2:14:15.620 --> 2:14:17.780\n It's gonna be that kind of fatherhood.\n\n2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:21.620\n I got it, I'm understanding so much more\n\n2:14:21.620 --> 2:14:23.860\n about Lex Freeman than I did before.\n\n2:14:23.860 --> 2:14:27.260\n That's why you have to have for me,\n\n2:14:27.260 --> 2:14:29.540\n that would be my wife would be probably softer.\n\n2:14:29.540 --> 2:14:31.740\n It's good cop, bad cop, because I think I'm.\n\n2:14:33.500 --> 2:14:35.540\n But of course, actually, because I don't have kids,\n\n2:14:35.540 --> 2:14:39.740\n I've seen some tough dudes when they have kids\n\n2:14:39.740 --> 2:14:44.340\n become like the softies.\n\n2:14:44.340 --> 2:14:47.260\n They become like, they do everything for their kids.\n\n2:14:47.260 --> 2:14:50.660\n It's become like, it's totally transforms their life.\n\n2:14:50.660 --> 2:14:53.180\n I mean, Joe Rogan is an example of that.\n\n2:14:53.180 --> 2:14:57.380\n I just seen so many tough guys completely become changed\n\n2:14:57.380 --> 2:15:00.420\n by having kids, which is fascinating to watch\n\n2:15:00.420 --> 2:15:03.540\n because it just shows you how meaningful having kids is\n\n2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:04.380\n for a lot of people.\n\n2:15:04.380 --> 2:15:09.380\n Although I would say having chatted with Joe for some time,\n\n2:15:09.380 --> 2:15:13.020\n I think he is a delightful,\n\n2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:14.980\n sweetheart, independent of children.\n\n2:15:14.980 --> 2:15:17.180\n I think, don't get me wrong,\n\n2:15:17.180 --> 2:15:19.740\n I don't wanna be in a ring with him.\n\n2:15:19.740 --> 2:15:22.220\n He would face me five ways till Tuesday,\n\n2:15:22.220 --> 2:15:24.740\n but I think he's a desperately sweet man\n\n2:15:24.740 --> 2:15:26.700\n and a very, very smart individual.\n\n2:15:26.700 --> 2:15:30.300\n Yeah, I mean, but he talks about the compassion he's gained\n\n2:15:30.300 --> 2:15:32.940\n from realizing just watching kids grow up\n\n2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:35.060\n that we were all kids at some point,\n\n2:15:35.060 --> 2:15:37.100\n you get a new perspective.\n\n2:15:37.100 --> 2:15:40.420\n I think just like me, I still get this with him.\n\n2:15:40.420 --> 2:15:43.380\n He's super competitive and there's a certain way\n\n2:15:43.380 --> 2:15:45.620\n to approach life.\n\n2:15:45.620 --> 2:15:47.700\n You're striving to do great things\n\n2:15:47.700 --> 2:15:49.820\n and you're competitive against others\n\n2:15:49.820 --> 2:15:52.220\n and that intensity of that aggression,\n\n2:15:53.140 --> 2:15:56.620\n that can lack compassion sometimes and empathy.\n\n2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:58.980\n And when you have children, you get a sense like,\n\n2:15:58.980 --> 2:16:00.940\n oh, everybody was a child at some point,\n\n2:16:00.940 --> 2:16:02.420\n everybody was a kid.\n\n2:16:02.420 --> 2:16:04.780\n And you see that whole development process.\n\n2:16:04.780 --> 2:16:07.300\n It can definitely enrich,\n\n2:16:07.300 --> 2:16:12.300\n expand your ability to be empathetic.\n\n2:16:13.420 --> 2:16:15.020\n Let me ask about diet.\n\n2:16:16.180 --> 2:16:19.540\n So what's the connection between diet and sleep?\n\n2:16:19.540 --> 2:16:21.220\n So I do intermittent fasting,\n\n2:16:21.220 --> 2:16:24.740\n sometimes only one meal a day, sometimes no meals a day.\n\n2:16:24.740 --> 2:16:26.700\n Is there a good science on the interaction\n\n2:16:26.700 --> 2:16:29.860\n between fasting and sleep?\n\n2:16:29.860 --> 2:16:33.060\n We have some data, I would prefer more,\n\n2:16:33.060 --> 2:16:36.940\n but we have data both on time restricted eating\n\n2:16:38.580 --> 2:16:43.580\n and then we have some data on fasting to a degree.\n\n2:16:45.980 --> 2:16:47.860\n On time restricted eating,\n\n2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:51.300\n I think that it has some benefits,\n\n2:16:51.300 --> 2:16:53.020\n although the human replication studies\n\n2:16:53.020 --> 2:16:54.540\n have actually not borne out\n\n2:16:54.540 --> 2:16:57.620\n quite the same health benefit extent\n\n2:16:57.620 --> 2:16:59.060\n that the animal studies have.\n\n2:16:59.060 --> 2:17:01.820\n There've been some disappointing studies,\n\n2:17:01.820 --> 2:17:05.820\n one here close to where we are right now at UCSF recently.\n\n2:17:06.820 --> 2:17:09.940\n So I think time restricted eating can be a good thing\n\n2:17:09.940 --> 2:17:13.140\n and there are many benefits of time restricted eating.\n\n2:17:13.140 --> 2:17:14.260\n Is sleep one of them?\n\n2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:15.940\n No, it doesn't seem to be\n\n2:17:15.940 --> 2:17:17.820\n because there are probably at the time\n\n2:17:17.820 --> 2:17:18.740\n that we're recording this,\n\n2:17:18.740 --> 2:17:21.580\n three pretty decent studies that I'm aware of.\n\n2:17:22.420 --> 2:17:25.740\n Two out of the three were in obese individuals,\n\n2:17:25.740 --> 2:17:29.340\n one out of the three were in healthy weight individuals.\n\n2:17:29.340 --> 2:17:31.580\n And what they found is that time restricted eating\n\n2:17:31.580 --> 2:17:33.500\n in all three of those studies\n\n2:17:33.500 --> 2:17:36.380\n didn't have any advantageous benefit to sleep.\n\n2:17:36.380 --> 2:17:38.700\n It didn't necessarily harm sleep,\n\n2:17:38.700 --> 2:17:41.820\n but it didn't seem to improve it.\n\n2:17:41.820 --> 2:17:43.220\n When it comes to fasting though,\n\n2:17:43.220 --> 2:17:45.980\n which is a different state,\n\n2:17:45.980 --> 2:17:47.500\n we don't have too many studies,\n\n2:17:47.500 --> 2:17:49.500\n experimental studies with longterm fasting.\n\n2:17:49.500 --> 2:17:50.780\n The best data that we have\n\n2:17:50.780 --> 2:17:53.020\n is probably from religious practices\n\n2:17:53.020 --> 2:17:56.980\n and probably the most data we have is during Ramadan\n\n2:17:56.980 --> 2:18:01.100\n where people will fast for 29 to 30 days\n\n2:18:01.100 --> 2:18:03.140\n from sunrise to sunset.\n\n2:18:04.660 --> 2:18:07.220\n And under those conditions,\n\n2:18:07.220 --> 2:18:12.220\n there are probably five distinct changes that we've seen.\n\n2:18:13.820 --> 2:18:16.220\n None of them seem to be particularly good for sleep.\n\n2:18:16.220 --> 2:18:18.420\n The first is that the amount of melatonin\n\n2:18:18.420 --> 2:18:20.740\n that you release, and melatonin is a hormone.\n\n2:18:20.740 --> 2:18:23.420\n It's often called the hormone of darkness\n\n2:18:23.420 --> 2:18:25.300\n or the vampire hormone,\n\n2:18:25.300 --> 2:18:27.100\n not because it makes you look longingly\n\n2:18:27.100 --> 2:18:28.300\n at people's necklines,\n\n2:18:28.300 --> 2:18:31.060\n but it's just because it comes out at night.\n\n2:18:31.060 --> 2:18:33.660\n Melatonin signals to your brain and your body\n\n2:18:33.660 --> 2:18:36.980\n that it's dark, it's nighttime, and it's time to sleep.\n\n2:18:36.980 --> 2:18:38.220\n Those individuals,\n\n2:18:38.220 --> 2:18:40.780\n when they were undergoing that regimen of fasting,\n\n2:18:42.580 --> 2:18:44.540\n the amount of melatonin that was released\n\n2:18:44.540 --> 2:18:45.860\n and when it was released,\n\n2:18:45.860 --> 2:18:48.060\n the amount of melatonin decreased\n\n2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:50.900\n and when it was released came later.\n\n2:18:50.900 --> 2:18:52.100\n That was the first thing.\n\n2:18:52.100 --> 2:18:56.340\n The second thing was that they ended up finding it harder\n\n2:18:56.340 --> 2:19:00.420\n to fall asleep as quickly as they normally would otherwise.\n\n2:19:00.420 --> 2:19:02.580\n The third thing was that the total amount of sleep\n\n2:19:02.580 --> 2:19:05.060\n that they were getting decreased.\n\n2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:06.660\n The fourth fascinating thing\n\n2:19:06.660 --> 2:19:09.140\n was that a wake promoting chemical\n\n2:19:09.140 --> 2:19:12.060\n called orexin increased.\n\n2:19:12.060 --> 2:19:13.900\n And this is why a lot of people will say,\n\n2:19:13.900 --> 2:19:18.260\n when I'm fasting, it feels like I can stay awake for longer\n\n2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:21.500\n and I'm more alert, I'm more active.\n\n2:19:21.500 --> 2:19:23.820\n And I'll come back from an evolutionary perspective\n\n2:19:23.820 --> 2:19:26.460\n why we understand that to be the case.\n\n2:19:26.460 --> 2:19:28.820\n And then the fourth factor is that fasting\n\n2:19:28.820 --> 2:19:31.380\n didn't decrease the amount of deep sleep\n\n2:19:31.380 --> 2:19:33.140\n that seemed to be unaffected.\n\n2:19:33.140 --> 2:19:35.220\n It did, however, decrease the amount\n\n2:19:35.220 --> 2:19:37.260\n of REM sleep or dream sleep.\n\n2:19:37.260 --> 2:19:38.580\n And we know that REM sleep dreaming\n\n2:19:38.580 --> 2:19:42.300\n is essential for emotional first aid, mental health,\n\n2:19:42.300 --> 2:19:45.140\n it's critical for memory, creativity.\n\n2:19:45.140 --> 2:19:47.260\n It's also critical for several hormone functions.\n\n2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:50.700\n It's when there's direct correlations\n\n2:19:50.700 --> 2:19:54.180\n between testosterone release peaks\n\n2:19:54.180 --> 2:19:57.940\n just before you go into REM sleep and during REM sleep too.\n\n2:19:57.940 --> 2:20:00.100\n So REM sleep is critical.\n\n2:20:00.100 --> 2:20:02.700\n But so those are the five changes that we've seen.\n\n2:20:02.700 --> 2:20:05.980\n None of them seem to be that advantageous for sleep.\n\n2:20:05.980 --> 2:20:07.740\n But the fourth point that I mentioned,\n\n2:20:07.740 --> 2:20:12.180\n which was orexin, which is this wake promoting chemical\n\n2:20:12.180 --> 2:20:15.140\n and a good demonstration or a very sad demonstration\n\n2:20:15.140 --> 2:20:18.780\n of its power is when it becomes very deficient in the brain\n\n2:20:18.780 --> 2:20:21.660\n and it leads to a condition called narcolepsy\n\n2:20:21.660 --> 2:20:26.660\n where you're just unpredictable with your sleep.\n\n2:20:26.660 --> 2:20:31.660\n So orexin when it's in high concentrations\n\n2:20:33.100 --> 2:20:35.140\n keeps you awake when you lose it.\n\n2:20:35.140 --> 2:20:38.860\n It can put you very much into a state of narcolepsy\n\n2:20:38.860 --> 2:20:40.980\n where you're sleeping a lot of the time\n\n2:20:40.980 --> 2:20:43.460\n in unpredictable sleep.\n\n2:20:43.460 --> 2:20:46.580\n Why on earth when you are fasting\n\n2:20:46.580 --> 2:20:51.580\n would the brain release awake promoting chemical?\n\n2:20:51.660 --> 2:20:54.980\n And our answer is right now is the following.\n\n2:20:54.980 --> 2:20:56.900\n One of the few times that I mentioned before\n\n2:20:56.900 --> 2:21:00.580\n that we see animals undergoing insufficient sleep\n\n2:21:00.580 --> 2:21:03.660\n or prolonged sleep deprivation\n\n2:21:03.660 --> 2:21:05.660\n is under conditions of starvation.\n\n2:21:06.540 --> 2:21:11.020\n And that is an extreme evolutionary pressure.\n\n2:21:11.020 --> 2:21:14.020\n And at that point, the brain will forgo some.\n\n2:21:14.020 --> 2:21:18.460\n It won't forgo all, but it will forgo some of its sleep.\n\n2:21:18.460 --> 2:21:21.220\n And the reason is so that it can stay awake for longer\n\n2:21:21.220 --> 2:21:24.460\n because the sign of starvation is saying to the brain,\n\n2:21:24.460 --> 2:21:27.900\n you can't find food in your normal foraging perimeter,\n\n2:21:27.900 --> 2:21:29.500\n you need to stay awake for longer\n\n2:21:29.500 --> 2:21:31.700\n so you can travel outside of your perimeter\n\n2:21:31.700 --> 2:21:33.980\n for a further distance\n\n2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:37.300\n and maybe you will find food and save the organism.\n\n2:21:37.300 --> 2:21:39.660\n So in other words, when we fast,\n\n2:21:39.660 --> 2:21:43.620\n it's giving our brain this evolutionary signal\n\n2:21:43.620 --> 2:21:46.380\n that you are under conditions of starvation.\n\n2:21:46.380 --> 2:21:49.020\n So the brain responds by saying, oh my goodness,\n\n2:21:49.020 --> 2:21:50.300\n I need to release the chemical\n\n2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:52.900\n that helps the organism stay awake for longer\n\n2:21:52.900 --> 2:21:54.300\n which is orexin.\n\n2:21:54.300 --> 2:21:57.420\n So that they can forage for more food.\n\n2:21:57.420 --> 2:21:59.940\n Now, of course, your brain from an evolutionary perspective\n\n2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:02.340\n doesn't know about this thing called Safeway\n\n2:22:02.340 --> 2:22:05.820\n that you could easily go to and break the fast.\n\n2:22:05.820 --> 2:22:08.340\n But that's how we understand fasting.\n\n2:22:08.340 --> 2:22:11.180\n And I think my dear friend, Peter Attia\n\n2:22:11.180 --> 2:22:14.060\n has done a lot of work in this area too.\n\n2:22:14.060 --> 2:22:17.340\n I think fasting and David Sinclair's brilliant work,\n\n2:22:17.340 --> 2:22:20.140\n goodness me, what an individual too.\n\n2:22:20.140 --> 2:22:21.940\n The work is pretty clear there\n\n2:22:21.940 --> 2:22:25.100\n that time restricted eating and fasting\n\n2:22:25.100 --> 2:22:27.860\n have wonderful health benefits.\n\n2:22:27.860 --> 2:22:32.740\n Fasting creates this thing called hormesis,\n\n2:22:32.740 --> 2:22:36.380\n just like exercise and low level stress\n\n2:22:36.380 --> 2:22:38.740\n and sauna, heat, shock.\n\n2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:41.620\n And hormesis is a biological process\n\n2:22:41.620 --> 2:22:43.740\n I think as David Sinclair has once said,\n\n2:22:43.740 --> 2:22:45.540\n in simple layman's terms is,\n\n2:22:45.540 --> 2:22:47.540\n what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\n\n2:22:47.540 --> 2:22:52.540\n And I think there is certainly good data\n\n2:22:53.300 --> 2:22:56.220\n that fasting and time restricted eating has many benefits.\n\n2:22:56.220 --> 2:22:57.740\n Is sleep one of them?\n\n2:22:57.740 --> 2:23:00.660\n It doesn't seem to be, it doesn't seem to enhance sleep.\n\n2:23:00.660 --> 2:23:04.700\n But it's interesting to understand its effects on sleep.\n\n2:23:04.700 --> 2:23:09.700\n I've fasted, it's a study of NF2.\n\n2:23:12.340 --> 2:23:16.820\n I once fasted 72 hours and another time 48 hours.\n\n2:23:16.820 --> 2:23:20.340\n And I found that I got much less sleep\n\n2:23:20.340 --> 2:23:22.580\n and it was very restful though.\n\n2:23:22.580 --> 2:23:24.700\n I hesitate to say this, but this is how I felt,\n\n2:23:24.700 --> 2:23:26.980\n which is I needed less sleep.\n\n2:23:26.980 --> 2:23:28.820\n I wonder if my brain is deceiving me\n\n2:23:28.820 --> 2:23:31.020\n because it feels like I'm getting\n\n2:23:31.020 --> 2:23:35.380\n a whole extra amount of focus for free.\n\n2:23:35.380 --> 2:23:39.660\n And I wonder if there's longterm impacts of that.\n\n2:23:39.660 --> 2:23:41.740\n Because if I fast 24 hours,\n\n2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:45.860\n get the same amount of calories, one meal a day,\n\n2:23:45.860 --> 2:23:47.260\n there's a little bit of discomfort.\n\n2:23:47.260 --> 2:23:50.500\n Like just maybe your body gets a little bit colder.\n\n2:23:50.500 --> 2:23:54.540\n Maybe there's just, I mean, hunger.\n\n2:23:54.540 --> 2:23:58.700\n But the amount of focus is crazy.\n\n2:23:58.700 --> 2:24:00.620\n And so I wonder, it's like,\n\n2:24:00.620 --> 2:24:02.060\n I'm a little suspicious of that.\n\n2:24:02.060 --> 2:24:04.260\n I feel like I'm getting something for free.\n\n2:24:04.260 --> 2:24:06.260\n I'm the same way with sweetener,\n\n2:24:06.260 --> 2:24:07.740\n like a Splendor or something.\n\n2:24:07.740 --> 2:24:10.340\n It's like, it's gotta be really bad for you, right?\n\n2:24:10.340 --> 2:24:12.740\n Because why is it so tasty, right?\n\n2:24:12.740 --> 2:24:17.740\n And I think, yeah, as we said before with biology,\n\n2:24:18.580 --> 2:24:23.100\n if there's a gain, there's often a cost too.\n\n2:24:25.180 --> 2:24:28.340\n But we at least understand the biological basis\n\n2:24:28.340 --> 2:24:29.180\n of what you're describing.\n\n2:24:29.180 --> 2:24:33.060\n It's not that you actually don't need less sleep.\n\n2:24:33.060 --> 2:24:36.220\n It's that this chemical is present\n\n2:24:36.220 --> 2:24:39.140\n that forces you more awake.\n\n2:24:39.140 --> 2:24:41.940\n And so subjectively you feel as though\n\n2:24:41.940 --> 2:24:45.180\n I don't need as much sleep because I'm wide awake.\n\n2:24:45.180 --> 2:24:47.820\n And those two things are quite different.\n\n2:24:47.820 --> 2:24:51.740\n It's not as though your sleep need has decreased.\n\n2:24:51.740 --> 2:24:54.260\n It's that your brain has hit the overdrive switch,\n\n2:24:54.260 --> 2:24:57.500\n the overboost switch to say, we need to keep you awake\n\n2:24:57.500 --> 2:24:59.620\n because food is in short supply.\n\n2:25:00.860 --> 2:25:03.340\n So you mentioned during sleep, there's a simulation,\n\n2:25:03.340 --> 2:25:05.380\n all those kinds of things for learning purposes,\n\n2:25:05.380 --> 2:25:08.140\n but there's also these, you mentioned the five ways\n\n2:25:08.140 --> 2:25:11.300\n in which we become psychotic in dreams.\n\n2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:14.380\n What do you think dreams are about?\n\n2:25:16.260 --> 2:25:17.700\n Why do you think we dream?\n\n2:25:17.700 --> 2:25:21.060\n What place do we go to when we dream?\n\n2:25:21.060 --> 2:25:22.340\n And why are they useful?\n\n2:25:22.340 --> 2:25:25.780\n Not just the assimilation aspect,\n\n2:25:25.780 --> 2:25:29.460\n but just like all the crazy visuals that we get with dreams.\n\n2:25:29.460 --> 2:25:33.340\n Is there something you can speak to that's actually useful?\n\n2:25:33.340 --> 2:25:38.340\n Like why we have such fun experiences in that dream world?\n\n2:25:38.340 --> 2:25:43.260\n So one of the camps in the sleep field\n\n2:25:43.260 --> 2:25:46.420\n is that dreams are meaningless,\n\n2:25:46.420 --> 2:25:49.580\n that they are an epiphenomenal byproduct\n\n2:25:49.580 --> 2:25:53.260\n of this thing called REM sleep from which dreams come from\n\n2:25:53.260 --> 2:25:55.380\n as a physiological state.\n\n2:25:55.380 --> 2:26:00.340\n So the analogy would be, let's think of a light bulb,\n\n2:26:00.340 --> 2:26:02.900\n that the reason that you create the apparatus\n\n2:26:02.900 --> 2:26:06.340\n of a light bulb is to produce this thing called light\n\n2:26:06.340 --> 2:26:08.660\n in the same way that we've evolved\n\n2:26:08.660 --> 2:26:10.300\n to this thing called REM sleep\n\n2:26:10.300 --> 2:26:13.700\n to serve whatever functions REM sleep serves.\n\n2:26:13.700 --> 2:26:17.060\n But it turns out that when you create light in that way,\n\n2:26:17.060 --> 2:26:19.820\n you also produce something called heat.\n\n2:26:19.820 --> 2:26:22.780\n It was never the reason that you designed the light bulb,\n\n2:26:22.780 --> 2:26:26.140\n it's just what happens when you create light in that way.\n\n2:26:26.140 --> 2:26:29.140\n And the belief so too was that dreaming\n\n2:26:29.140 --> 2:26:32.140\n was essentially the heat of the light bulb.\n\n2:26:32.140 --> 2:26:34.820\n That REM sleep is critical,\n\n2:26:34.820 --> 2:26:38.340\n but when you have REM sleep with a complex brain like ours,\n\n2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:43.340\n you also produce this conscious epiphenomenon called dreaming.\n\n2:26:44.500 --> 2:26:46.140\n I don't believe that for a second.\n\n2:26:46.140 --> 2:26:50.660\n And from a simple perspective is that I suspect\n\n2:26:50.660 --> 2:26:54.380\n that dreaming is more metabolically costly\n\n2:26:54.380 --> 2:26:56.820\n as a conscious experience than not dreaming.\n\n2:26:56.820 --> 2:26:58.580\n So you could still have REM sleep,\n\n2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:01.860\n but absent the conscious experience of dreaming\n\n2:27:01.860 --> 2:27:05.540\n was probably less metabolically costly.\n\n2:27:05.540 --> 2:27:08.700\n And whenever mother nature burns the energy unit\n\n2:27:08.700 --> 2:27:12.300\n called ATP, which is the most valuable thing,\n\n2:27:13.620 --> 2:27:15.220\n there's usually a reason for it.\n\n2:27:15.220 --> 2:27:20.220\n So if it's more energetically demanding,\n\n2:27:20.340 --> 2:27:22.980\n then I suspect that there is a function to it.\n\n2:27:22.980 --> 2:27:26.540\n And we've now since discovered that dreams have a function.\n\n2:27:26.540 --> 2:27:29.100\n The first, as we mentioned, creativity.\n\n2:27:29.100 --> 2:27:32.260\n The second is that dreams provide a form\n\n2:27:32.260 --> 2:27:35.060\n of overnight therapy.\n\n2:27:35.060 --> 2:27:38.780\n Dreaming is a form of emotional first aid.\n\n2:27:38.780 --> 2:27:40.500\n And it's during dream sleep at night\n\n2:27:40.500 --> 2:27:43.820\n that we take these difficult, painful experiences\n\n2:27:43.820 --> 2:27:46.940\n that we've had during the day, sometimes traumatic,\n\n2:27:46.940 --> 2:27:51.340\n and dream sleep acts almost like a nocturnal soothing balm.\n\n2:27:51.340 --> 2:27:53.420\n And it sort of just takes the sharp edges\n\n2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:56.260\n off those difficult, painful experiences\n\n2:27:56.260 --> 2:27:58.580\n so that you come back the next day\n\n2:27:58.580 --> 2:28:01.500\n and you feel better about them.\n\n2:28:01.500 --> 2:28:03.940\n And so I think in that sense, dreaming,\n\n2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:07.260\n it's not time that heals all wounds.\n\n2:28:07.260 --> 2:28:09.340\n It's time during dream sleep\n\n2:28:09.340 --> 2:28:12.580\n that provides emotional convalescence.\n\n2:28:12.580 --> 2:28:17.580\n So dreaming is almost a form of emotional windscreen wipers.\n\n2:28:19.860 --> 2:28:24.860\n And I think, and by the way, it's not just that you dream.\n\n2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:29.860\n It's what you dream about that also matters.\n\n2:28:30.020 --> 2:28:32.060\n So for example, scientists have done studies\n\n2:28:32.060 --> 2:28:33.020\n with learning and memory\n\n2:28:33.020 --> 2:28:36.060\n where they have people learn a virtual maze.\n\n2:28:37.420 --> 2:28:40.420\n And what they discovered was that those people\n\n2:28:40.420 --> 2:28:45.180\n who then dreamed, but dreamed of the maze\n\n2:28:45.180 --> 2:28:47.820\n were the only ones who, when they woke up,\n\n2:28:47.820 --> 2:28:50.740\n ended up being better at navigating the maze.\n\n2:28:50.740 --> 2:28:53.380\n Whereas those people who dreamed,\n\n2:28:53.380 --> 2:28:55.820\n but didn't dream about the maze itself,\n\n2:28:55.820 --> 2:28:57.940\n they were no better at navigating the maze.\n\n2:28:57.940 --> 2:28:59.060\n So it's not just that you,\n\n2:28:59.060 --> 2:29:02.380\n it's not sort of necessary, but not sufficient.\n\n2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:04.260\n It's necessary that you dream,\n\n2:29:04.260 --> 2:29:06.780\n but it's not sufficient to produce the benefit.\n\n2:29:06.780 --> 2:29:09.860\n You have to be dreaming about certain things itself.\n\n2:29:09.860 --> 2:29:13.300\n And the same is true for mental health.\n\n2:29:13.300 --> 2:29:14.740\n What we've discovered is that people\n\n2:29:14.740 --> 2:29:17.100\n who are going through a very difficult experience,\n\n2:29:17.100 --> 2:29:21.140\n a trauma, for example, a very painful divorce,\n\n2:29:21.140 --> 2:29:23.820\n those people who are dreaming, but dreaming\n\n2:29:23.820 --> 2:29:26.300\n of that difficult event itself,\n\n2:29:26.300 --> 2:29:28.540\n they go on to gain resolution\n\n2:29:28.540 --> 2:29:31.100\n to their clinical depression one year later.\n\n2:29:31.100 --> 2:29:34.580\n Whereas people who were dreaming just as much,\n\n2:29:34.580 --> 2:29:37.340\n but not dreaming about the trauma itself,\n\n2:29:37.340 --> 2:29:40.700\n did not go on to gain as much clinical resolution\n\n2:29:40.700 --> 2:29:42.260\n to their depression.\n\n2:29:42.260 --> 2:29:46.860\n So it's, I think to me, those are the lines of evidence\n\n2:29:46.860 --> 2:29:50.260\n that tell me dreaming is not epiphenomenal.\n\n2:29:50.260 --> 2:29:53.820\n And it's not just about the act of dreaming,\n\n2:29:53.820 --> 2:29:57.140\n it's about the content of the dreams,\n\n2:29:57.140 --> 2:30:00.420\n not just the fact of a dream itself.\n\n2:30:00.420 --> 2:30:01.780\n It's, first of all, it's fascinating.\n\n2:30:01.780 --> 2:30:02.900\n It makes a lot of sense,\n\n2:30:02.900 --> 2:30:05.540\n but then immediately takes my mind to,\n\n2:30:05.540 --> 2:30:07.100\n from an engineering perspective,\n\n2:30:07.100 --> 2:30:11.780\n how that could be useful in, for example, AI systems of,\n\n2:30:13.140 --> 2:30:16.780\n if you think about dreaming as an important part\n\n2:30:16.780 --> 2:30:21.780\n about learning and cognition and filtering previous memories\n\n2:30:22.780 --> 2:30:25.380\n of what's important, integrating them.\n\n2:30:25.380 --> 2:30:27.020\n You know, maybe you can correct me,\n\n2:30:27.020 --> 2:30:31.420\n but I see dreaming as a kind of simulation of worlds\n\n2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:34.540\n that are not constrained by physics.\n\n2:30:34.540 --> 2:30:37.780\n So like you get a chance to take some of your memories,\n\n2:30:37.780 --> 2:30:40.260\n some of your thoughts, some of your anxieties,\n\n2:30:40.260 --> 2:30:43.900\n and play with them, like construct virtual worlds\n\n2:30:43.900 --> 2:30:46.540\n and see how it evolves.\n\n2:30:46.540 --> 2:30:48.820\n Like to play with those worlds\n\n2:30:48.820 --> 2:30:51.980\n in a safe environment of your mind, safe in quotes,\n\n2:30:51.980 --> 2:30:53.740\n because you could probably get into a lot of trouble\n\n2:30:53.740 --> 2:30:56.900\n with the places your mind will go.\n\n2:30:56.900 --> 2:31:01.900\n But this definitely is applied in much cruder ways\n\n2:31:04.260 --> 2:31:05.820\n in artificial intelligence.\n\n2:31:05.820 --> 2:31:08.700\n So one context in which this is applied\n\n2:31:08.700 --> 2:31:12.740\n is the process called self play,\n\n2:31:12.740 --> 2:31:14.380\n which is a reinforcement learning\n\n2:31:14.380 --> 2:31:19.380\n where agents play against itself or versions of itself.\n\n2:31:19.900 --> 2:31:23.340\n And it's all simulated of trying different versions\n\n2:31:23.340 --> 2:31:25.260\n of themselves and playing against each other\n\n2:31:25.260 --> 2:31:29.060\n to see what ends up being a good.\n\n2:31:29.060 --> 2:31:32.580\n The ultimate goal is to learn a function\n\n2:31:32.580 --> 2:31:34.820\n that represents what is good and what is not good\n\n2:31:34.820 --> 2:31:36.260\n in terms of how you should act in the world.\n\n2:31:36.260 --> 2:31:39.420\n You create a set of decision weights based on experience,\n\n2:31:39.420 --> 2:31:41.500\n and you constantly update those weights\n\n2:31:41.500 --> 2:31:43.020\n based on ongoing learning.\n\n2:31:43.020 --> 2:31:45.940\n But the experience is artificially created\n\n2:31:45.940 --> 2:31:48.580\n versus actual real data.\n\n2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:51.580\n So it's a crude approximation of what dreams are,\n\n2:31:51.580 --> 2:31:54.380\n which is you're hallucinating a lot of things\n\n2:31:54.380 --> 2:31:56.420\n to see which things are actually.\n\n2:31:56.420 --> 2:31:59.300\n No, I think it's been a theory that's been put forward,\n\n2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:04.300\n which is that dreaming is a virtual reality test space\n\n2:32:04.500 --> 2:32:06.700\n that is largely consequence free.\n\n2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:11.100\n What an incredible gift to give a conscious mind\n\n2:32:11.100 --> 2:32:13.260\n to each and every night.\n\n2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:15.940\n Now the conscious mind, the human mind\n\n2:32:15.940 --> 2:32:17.820\n is very good at constructing dreams\n\n2:32:17.820 --> 2:32:20.700\n that are nevertheless useful for you.\n\n2:32:20.700 --> 2:32:22.580\n Like they're wild and crazy,\n\n2:32:22.580 --> 2:32:27.460\n but they're such that they are still grounded in reality\n\n2:32:27.460 --> 2:32:29.980\n to a degree where anything you learn in dreams\n\n2:32:29.980 --> 2:32:32.140\n might be useful in reality.\n\n2:32:32.140 --> 2:32:34.420\n This is a very difficult thing to do\n\n2:32:34.420 --> 2:32:36.580\n because it requires a lot of intelligence,\n\n2:32:36.580 --> 2:32:38.020\n it requires consciousness.\n\n2:32:38.020 --> 2:32:41.700\n This has been effectively recently being used\n\n2:32:41.700 --> 2:32:45.980\n in a self supervised learning for computer vision\n\n2:32:45.980 --> 2:32:50.060\n with the process of what's called data augmentation.\n\n2:32:50.060 --> 2:32:53.260\n That's a very crude version of dreams,\n\n2:32:53.260 --> 2:32:55.500\n which is you take data and you mess with it\n\n2:32:56.700 --> 2:33:01.220\n and you start to learn how a picture of a cat\n\n2:33:02.660 --> 2:33:06.980\n truly represents a cat by messing with it in different ways.\n\n2:33:06.980 --> 2:33:09.780\n Now the crude methods currently are cropping, rotating,\n\n2:33:09.780 --> 2:33:11.500\n distorting, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:33:11.500 --> 2:33:14.140\n But you can imagine much more complicated\n\n2:33:14.980 --> 2:33:19.460\n generative processes that start hallucinating different cats\n\n2:33:19.460 --> 2:33:23.140\n in order for you to understand deeply of what it means\n\n2:33:23.140 --> 2:33:25.060\n for something to look like a cat.\n\n2:33:25.060 --> 2:33:27.660\n What is the prototype of a archetype of a cat?\n\n2:33:27.660 --> 2:33:28.500\n Yeah, the archetype.\n\n2:33:28.500 --> 2:33:31.900\n I mean, that's a very difficult process for computer vision\n\n2:33:31.900 --> 2:33:36.060\n to go from what are the pixels\n\n2:33:36.060 --> 2:33:38.500\n that are usually associated with a cat\n\n2:33:38.500 --> 2:33:42.860\n to like, what is a cat in the visual space?\n\n2:33:42.860 --> 2:33:46.500\n In the three dimensional visual spaces projected on an image,\n\n2:33:46.500 --> 2:33:50.260\n on a two dimensional image, what is a cat?\n\n2:33:50.260 --> 2:33:52.860\n Those are like fundamentally philosophical questions\n\n2:33:52.860 --> 2:33:56.500\n that we humans don't know the answer to,\n\n2:33:56.500 --> 2:33:57.900\n like linguistically.\n\n2:33:57.900 --> 2:34:00.900\n But when we look at a picture of a cat and a dog,\n\n2:34:00.900 --> 2:34:04.300\n we can usually tell pretty damn well what's the difference.\n\n2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:06.980\n And I don't know what that is because you can't reduce that\n\n2:34:06.980 --> 2:34:09.980\n to pointy ears or non pointy ears,\n\n2:34:09.980 --> 2:34:12.460\n furry or not furry, something about the eyes.\n\n2:34:12.460 --> 2:34:14.860\n It's been a long standing issue in cognitive science,\n\n2:34:14.860 --> 2:34:16.620\n cognitive neuroscience too,\n\n2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:20.180\n is how does the brain create an archetype?\n\n2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:25.020\n How does it create schemas that have general applicability,\n\n2:34:26.220 --> 2:34:29.700\n but yet still obtain specificity?\n\n2:34:29.700 --> 2:34:31.660\n That's a very difficult challenge.\n\n2:34:31.660 --> 2:34:33.340\n I mean, we can do it, we do it.\n\n2:34:33.340 --> 2:34:35.620\n It's rather bloody amazing.\n\n2:34:35.620 --> 2:34:37.700\n And it seems like part of the toolbox\n\n2:34:37.700 --> 2:34:41.100\n is this controlled hallucination, which is dreams.\n\n2:34:41.100 --> 2:34:45.860\n Well, it's a relaxing of the rigid constraints.\n\n2:34:45.860 --> 2:34:48.700\n I often think of dreaming as,\n\n2:34:48.700 --> 2:34:52.660\n it's from an information processing standpoint,\n\n2:34:52.660 --> 2:34:54.620\n the prison guards are away\n\n2:34:54.620 --> 2:34:58.980\n and the prisoners are running a mock in a delightful way.\n\n2:34:58.980 --> 2:35:00.580\n And part of the reason is because when you go\n\n2:35:00.580 --> 2:35:03.580\n into dream sleep, the rational part of your brain\n\n2:35:03.580 --> 2:35:05.860\n called the prefrontal cortex, which is the part,\n\n2:35:05.860 --> 2:35:07.620\n it's like the CEO of the brain.\n\n2:35:07.620 --> 2:35:09.500\n It's very good at making high level, rational,\n\n2:35:09.500 --> 2:35:12.500\n top down decisions and controlled actions.\n\n2:35:12.500 --> 2:35:17.260\n That part of the brain is shut down during REM sleep.\n\n2:35:17.260 --> 2:35:20.580\n But then emotional centers, memory centers,\n\n2:35:20.580 --> 2:35:24.140\n visual centers, motoric centers,\n\n2:35:24.140 --> 2:35:27.180\n all of those centers actually become more active.\n\n2:35:27.180 --> 2:35:29.540\n In fact, some of them are more active\n\n2:35:29.540 --> 2:35:32.860\n than when we're awake in the dream state.\n\n2:35:32.860 --> 2:35:33.700\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:35:33.700 --> 2:35:37.300\n So your brain from a neural architecture perspective\n\n2:35:37.300 --> 2:35:39.500\n is radically different.\n\n2:35:39.500 --> 2:35:44.460\n Its network feature is not the same as wakefulness.\n\n2:35:44.460 --> 2:35:48.100\n And I think this is an immensely beneficial thing\n\n2:35:48.100 --> 2:35:51.700\n that we have at least two different rational\n\n2:35:51.700 --> 2:35:54.220\n and irrational conscious states\n\n2:35:54.220 --> 2:35:56.420\n that we do information processing in.\n\n2:35:56.420 --> 2:35:58.180\n The rational, the veritical,\n\n2:35:58.180 --> 2:36:01.380\n the page one of the Google search is wakefulness.\n\n2:36:01.380 --> 2:36:05.980\n The more irrational, illogical, hyper associative\n\n2:36:05.980 --> 2:36:08.620\n Google page 20 is the REM sleep.\n\n2:36:08.620 --> 2:36:11.940\n Both I think are critical, both are necessary.\n\n2:36:11.940 --> 2:36:12.780\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:36:12.780 --> 2:36:15.660\n And again, fascinating to see how that could be integrated\n\n2:36:15.660 --> 2:36:18.700\n in the machines to help them learn better\n\n2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:21.660\n and to reason better.\n\n2:36:22.620 --> 2:36:24.460\n And in some ways we also know it\n\n2:36:24.460 --> 2:36:25.900\n from a chemical perspective too.\n\n2:36:25.900 --> 2:36:27.820\n When you go into dream sleep,\n\n2:36:27.820 --> 2:36:31.060\n it is a neurochemical cocktail like no other\n\n2:36:31.060 --> 2:36:34.900\n that we see at the rest of the 24 hour state.\n\n2:36:34.900 --> 2:36:37.700\n There is a chemical called noradrenaline\n\n2:36:37.700 --> 2:36:40.380\n or norepinephrine in the brain.\n\n2:36:40.380 --> 2:36:42.060\n And you know of its sister chemical\n\n2:36:42.060 --> 2:36:44.500\n in the body called adrenaline.\n\n2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:46.900\n But upstairs in the brain, noradrenaline\n\n2:36:46.900 --> 2:36:49.620\n is very good at creating a very hyper focused,\n\n2:36:49.620 --> 2:36:54.620\n attentive, narrow, it's sort of very convergent way\n\n2:36:54.620 --> 2:36:59.620\n of thinking to a point, sharp focus, that's the only thing.\n\n2:37:01.180 --> 2:37:04.100\n The spotlight of consciousness is very narrow.\n\n2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:05.820\n That's noradrenaline.\n\n2:37:05.820 --> 2:37:08.780\n When you remove noradrenaline,\n\n2:37:08.780 --> 2:37:13.780\n then you go from a high SNR, a high signal to noise ratio\n\n2:37:14.380 --> 2:37:16.860\n where it's just you and I in this moment,\n\n2:37:16.860 --> 2:37:18.900\n I don't even know what's going on elsewhere.\n\n2:37:18.900 --> 2:37:22.580\n I am with you, noradrenaline is present.\n\n2:37:22.580 --> 2:37:24.900\n But when you go into REM sleep,\n\n2:37:24.900 --> 2:37:27.180\n it is the only time during the 24 hour period\n\n2:37:27.180 --> 2:37:30.020\n where your brain is devoid of any noradrenaline,\n\n2:37:30.020 --> 2:37:31.700\n it is completely shut off.\n\n2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:34.900\n And so the signal to noise ratio is very different.\n\n2:37:34.900 --> 2:37:36.620\n It's almost as though we're injecting\n\n2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:40.180\n a greater amount of noise into the neural architecture\n\n2:37:40.180 --> 2:37:42.420\n of the brain during dream sleep,\n\n2:37:42.420 --> 2:37:45.740\n as if it's chemically brute forced\n\n2:37:45.740 --> 2:37:50.740\n into this relaxed associative memory processing state.\n\n2:37:50.740 --> 2:37:53.140\n And then from an anatomical perspective,\n\n2:37:53.140 --> 2:37:56.180\n just as I described, the prefrontal cortex goes down\n\n2:37:56.180 --> 2:37:58.580\n and other regions light up.\n\n2:37:58.580 --> 2:38:01.660\n So it is a state that seems to be very,\n\n2:38:01.660 --> 2:38:06.420\n I mean, if you were to show me a brain scan of REM sleep\n\n2:38:06.420 --> 2:38:08.820\n and tell me that it's not REM sleep,\n\n2:38:08.820 --> 2:38:11.620\n just say, look, based on the pattern of this brain activity,\n\n2:38:11.620 --> 2:38:14.420\n what would you say is going on in this person's mind?\n\n2:38:14.420 --> 2:38:16.500\n I would say, well, they're probably not rational.\n\n2:38:16.500 --> 2:38:18.140\n They're probably not having logical thought\n\n2:38:18.140 --> 2:38:19.940\n because their prefrontal cortex is down.\n\n2:38:19.940 --> 2:38:21.460\n They're probably feeling very emotional\n\n2:38:21.460 --> 2:38:23.580\n because their amygdala is active,\n\n2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:25.420\n which is an emotional center of the brain.\n\n2:38:25.420 --> 2:38:27.340\n They're definitely going to be thinking visually\n\n2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:30.620\n because the back of the brain is lit up, the visual cortex.\n\n2:38:30.620 --> 2:38:33.900\n It's probably going to be filled with past experience\n\n2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:35.940\n and autobiographical memories\n\n2:38:35.940 --> 2:38:39.540\n because their memory centers are lighting up.\n\n2:38:39.540 --> 2:38:40.820\n And there's probably going to be movement\n\n2:38:40.820 --> 2:38:43.020\n because their motor cortex is very active.\n\n2:38:43.940 --> 2:38:45.940\n That to me sounds very much like a dream.\n\n2:38:45.940 --> 2:38:48.060\n And that's exactly what we see in brain scanners\n\n2:38:48.060 --> 2:38:50.420\n when we've put people inside of them.\n\n2:38:50.420 --> 2:38:54.340\n One of the things I notice sleep affects\n\n2:38:54.340 --> 2:38:59.340\n is my ability to see the beauty in the world.\n\n2:39:00.180 --> 2:39:03.700\n So what do you think is the connection\n\n2:39:03.700 --> 2:39:06.020\n between sleep and your emotional life,\n\n2:39:06.020 --> 2:39:10.540\n your ability to love other human beings and love life?\n\n2:39:10.540 --> 2:39:15.540\n Yeah, I think it's very powerful and strong.\n\n2:39:16.380 --> 2:39:19.020\n So we've done a lot of work in the field\n\n2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:21.540\n of sleep and emotion and sleep and moods.\n\n2:39:21.540 --> 2:39:26.060\n And you can separate your emotions into two main buckets,\n\n2:39:26.060 --> 2:39:28.540\n positive and negative.\n\n2:39:28.540 --> 2:39:32.020\n And what's interesting is that when you are sleep deprived\n\n2:39:32.020 --> 2:39:35.540\n and the more hours that you go into being awake\n\n2:39:35.540 --> 2:39:37.980\n and the fewer hours that you've had to sleep,\n\n2:39:37.980 --> 2:39:42.980\n your negative mood starts to increase.\n\n2:39:43.260 --> 2:39:46.300\n And we know which individual types\n\n2:39:46.300 --> 2:39:48.540\n of emotions are changing.\n\n2:39:48.540 --> 2:39:51.140\n I've got a wonderful postdoc in my lab\n\n2:39:51.140 --> 2:39:53.980\n called Etty Ben Simon, who's doing some incredible work\n\n2:39:53.980 --> 2:39:57.100\n on trying to understand the emotional,\n\n2:39:57.100 --> 2:40:02.100\n individual emotional tapestry of affective,\n\n2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:07.100\n meltdown when you're not getting sufficient sleep.\n\n2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:09.180\n But let's just keep with two dimensions,\n\n2:40:09.180 --> 2:40:10.020\n positive and negative.\n\n2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:10.860\n Yes.\n\n2:40:10.860 --> 2:40:13.460\n Most people would think, well, it's the negative\n\n2:40:13.460 --> 2:40:15.700\n that takes the biggest hit when I'm sleep deprived.\n\n2:40:15.700 --> 2:40:17.020\n It's not.\n\n2:40:17.020 --> 2:40:20.860\n By probably in a log order, magnitude larger\n\n2:40:20.860 --> 2:40:23.900\n is a hit on your positive emotions.\n\n2:40:23.900 --> 2:40:27.860\n In other words, you stop being sleep deprived\n\n2:40:27.860 --> 2:40:32.860\n of positive emotions, in other words, you stop gaining\n\n2:40:32.900 --> 2:40:35.140\n pleasure from normally pleasurable things.\n\n2:40:35.140 --> 2:40:38.420\n And it's a state that we call anhedonia.\n\n2:40:38.420 --> 2:40:43.420\n And anhedonia is the state that we often call depression.\n\n2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:47.300\n So depression to most people's surprise isn't necessarily\n\n2:40:47.300 --> 2:40:52.060\n that you're always feeling negative emotions.\n\n2:40:52.060 --> 2:40:56.780\n It's often more about the fact that you lose the pleasure\n\n2:40:56.780 --> 2:40:58.700\n in the good things in life.\n\n2:40:58.700 --> 2:41:00.620\n That's what we call anhedonia.\n\n2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:03.740\n That's what we see in sleep, an insufficient sleep.\n\n2:41:03.740 --> 2:41:05.540\n And it happens quite quickly.\n\n2:41:05.540 --> 2:41:06.900\n Yeah, it's kind of fascinating.\n\n2:41:06.900 --> 2:41:10.660\n I think I do, it's not depression,\n\n2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:15.180\n but like it's a stroll into that direction,\n\n2:41:15.180 --> 2:41:17.340\n which is when I'm sleep deprived,\n\n2:41:17.340 --> 2:41:20.400\n I stop being able to see the meaning in life.\n\n2:41:21.340 --> 2:41:24.980\n The things that gave me meanings starts to lose meaning.\n\n2:41:24.980 --> 2:41:29.040\n Like it makes me realize how enjoyable everything is\n\n2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:31.420\n in my life because when I start to lose it,\n\n2:41:31.420 --> 2:41:33.600\n when I'm severely sleep deprived,\n\n2:41:33.600 --> 2:41:36.060\n you start to see how much life sucks when you lose it.\n\n2:41:36.060 --> 2:41:38.740\n But that said, I'm just cognizant enough\n\n2:41:38.740 --> 2:41:40.760\n that sleep fixes all of that.\n\n2:41:40.760 --> 2:41:44.140\n So I use those states for what they're worth.\n\n2:41:44.140 --> 2:41:48.860\n In fact, I personally like to pay attention to the things\n\n2:41:48.860 --> 2:41:52.780\n that bother me in doing that time.\n\n2:41:52.780 --> 2:41:56.800\n Cause they also reveal important information to me.\n\n2:41:58.220 --> 2:41:59.500\n That's interesting.\n\n2:41:59.500 --> 2:42:02.220\n I have to use like a Rorschach to, yeah.\n\n2:42:02.220 --> 2:42:05.700\n I mean, there's, so I find this when I fast combine\n\n2:42:05.700 --> 2:42:10.700\n with sleep deprivation, I'm clear to see with people,\n\n2:42:10.700 --> 2:42:12.940\n clear and identifying the things\n\n2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:15.740\n that are not going right in my life\n\n2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:19.100\n or people that I'm working with are not doing\n\n2:42:19.100 --> 2:42:21.140\n as good of a job as they could be doing.\n\n2:42:21.140 --> 2:42:25.940\n Like people that are negative in my life,\n\n2:42:25.940 --> 2:42:28.160\n I'm more able to identify them.\n\n2:42:28.160 --> 2:42:30.020\n So I don't act on that.\n\n2:42:30.020 --> 2:42:32.340\n It's a very bad time to act on those decisions,\n\n2:42:32.340 --> 2:42:36.860\n but I'm like recording that information\n\n2:42:36.860 --> 2:42:40.040\n because I usually, when I'm well rested and happy,\n\n2:42:40.040 --> 2:42:42.040\n I see the beauty in everybody,\n\n2:42:42.040 --> 2:42:44.020\n which can get you into trouble.\n\n2:42:44.020 --> 2:42:46.020\n So you have to balance those two things.\n\n2:42:46.020 --> 2:42:47.340\n But yes, it's fascinating.\n\n2:42:47.340 --> 2:42:50.260\n But there's irony there too, which is the fact that,\n\n2:42:50.260 --> 2:42:51.980\n you know, when you're well rested and well slept,\n\n2:42:51.980 --> 2:42:55.060\n just as you said, you see the beauty in life\n\n2:42:55.060 --> 2:42:56.820\n and it sort of enlivens you\n\n2:42:56.820 --> 2:43:01.580\n and sort of gives you a quality of life\n\n2:43:01.580 --> 2:43:03.760\n that's emotionally very different.\n\n2:43:04.880 --> 2:43:09.880\n Yet then we are contrasting that against the need\n\n2:43:13.300 --> 2:43:15.600\n for not getting enough sleep\n\n2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:17.620\n because of the beautiful things\n\n2:43:17.620 --> 2:43:20.480\n that you want to accomplish in life.\n\n2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:23.860\n And I don't actually see them as,\n\n2:43:25.780 --> 2:43:29.380\n you know, sort of completely counterintuitive\n\n2:43:29.380 --> 2:43:32.740\n or paradoxical because I still think that you can strive\n\n2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:35.560\n for all of the brilliant things that you are striving for,\n\n2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:38.020\n to have the monumental goals,\n\n2:43:38.020 --> 2:43:42.160\n the Herculean challenges that you wish to take on and solve.\n\n2:43:43.480 --> 2:43:46.140\n They can still enthrall you and excite you\n\n2:43:46.140 --> 2:43:48.020\n and stimulate you.\n\n2:43:48.020 --> 2:43:52.060\n But because of the insufficient sleep that they can\n\n2:43:52.060 --> 2:43:55.420\n or that goal can produce,\n\n2:43:55.420 --> 2:43:59.980\n it will shave off the beauty of life\n\n2:43:59.980 --> 2:44:01.300\n that you experience in between.\n\n2:44:01.300 --> 2:44:04.100\n And again, this is just about the trade off.\n\n2:44:04.100 --> 2:44:05.200\n I will say though that,\n\n2:44:05.200 --> 2:44:09.080\n and this is not applicable to your circumstance,\n\n2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:14.380\n we do know that insufficient sleep\n\n2:44:14.380 --> 2:44:18.720\n is very strongly linked to suicide ideation,\n\n2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:22.880\n suicide attempts and tragically suicide completion as well.\n\n2:44:24.160 --> 2:44:28.220\n And in fact, in 20 years of studying sleep,\n\n2:44:28.220 --> 2:44:29.780\n we have not been able to discover\n\n2:44:29.780 --> 2:44:32.880\n a single psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal.\n\n2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:37.380\n And I think that that is a profound,\n\n2:44:37.380 --> 2:44:41.860\n I think it tells us so much about the role of sleep\n\n2:44:41.860 --> 2:44:45.100\n as a potential causal agent in psychiatric conditions.\n\n2:44:45.100 --> 2:44:47.620\n I also think it's a potential sign\n\n2:44:47.620 --> 2:44:50.020\n that we should be using sleep as a tool\n\n2:44:50.020 --> 2:44:52.260\n for the prevention of grave mental illness.\n\n2:44:52.260 --> 2:44:54.900\n Yeah, it's both a cause and a solution.\n\n2:44:54.900 --> 2:44:57.060\n So yeah, I mean, me personally,\n\n2:44:57.060 --> 2:45:01.340\n I've gone through a few dark periods quite recently\n\n2:45:01.340 --> 2:45:06.260\n and it was almost always sleep is not the cause,\n\n2:45:06.260 --> 2:45:10.820\n but sleep is the catalyst from going to a bad time\n\n2:45:10.820 --> 2:45:12.380\n to a very bad time.\n\n2:45:12.380 --> 2:45:13.220\n Yeah.\n\n2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:15.080\n And so it's definitely true.\n\n2:45:15.080 --> 2:45:18.560\n And it's funny how sleep can just cure all of that.\n\n2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:20.080\n There's actually a beautiful quote\n\n2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:24.360\n by an American entrepreneur called E. Joseph Kosman,\n\n2:45:24.360 --> 2:45:26.060\n who once said that the best bridge\n\n2:45:26.060 --> 2:45:29.600\n between despair and hope is a good night's sleep.\n\n2:45:30.780 --> 2:45:35.780\n And I spilled quite so much ink and hundreds of pages\n\n2:45:37.140 --> 2:45:40.220\n in elegantly trying to say the same thing in my book.\n\n2:45:40.220 --> 2:45:43.860\n And he said it in one line and it's beautiful.\n\n2:45:43.860 --> 2:45:45.420\n What do you think is,\n\n2:45:45.420 --> 2:45:47.500\n we've been talking about how to extend this life,\n\n2:45:47.500 --> 2:45:48.940\n how to make it a good life.\n\n2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:53.460\n We've been talking about love.\n\n2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:55.840\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole ride?\n\n2:45:55.840 --> 2:45:56.680\n Of life?\n\n2:45:56.680 --> 2:45:57.500\n Of life.\n\n2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:00.800\n Why do we wanna make it a good one?\n\n2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:01.860\n Do you think there's a meaning?\n\n2:46:01.860 --> 2:46:03.940\n Do you think there's a answer to the why?\n\n2:46:05.700 --> 2:46:06.880\n For me personally,\n\n2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:11.880\n I think the meaning of life is to eat,\n\n2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:20.120\n is to sleep, is to fall in love, is to cry,\n\n2:46:22.840 --> 2:46:23.740\n and then to die.\n\n2:46:27.300 --> 2:46:29.760\n Oh, and probably race cars in between.\n\n2:46:29.760 --> 2:46:30.600\n Race cars.\n\n2:46:30.600 --> 2:46:33.400\n Well, there's a whole topic of sex we didn't talk about.\n\n2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:34.880\n So that's probably in there.\n\n2:46:34.880 --> 2:46:35.720\n Should we do that?\n\n2:46:35.720 --> 2:46:38.920\n Maybe if you'll have me back, I would love to do.\n\n2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:39.760\n I will go around to.\n\n2:46:39.760 --> 2:46:42.760\n Next time we will do another three hours on sex alone.\n\n2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:43.600\n Has it been?\n\n2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:44.440\n Yeah.\n\n2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:46.800\n It has been over three hours.\n\n2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:47.640\n Gosh, okay.\n\n2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:50.320\n Matt, I'm a big fan of your work.\n\n2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:51.960\n I think you're doing really important work.\n\n2:46:51.960 --> 2:46:54.240\n Even despite all the things I've been saying\n\n2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:56.600\n about the madness of my own sleep schedule,\n\n2:46:56.600 --> 2:46:58.720\n I think you're helping millions of people.\n\n2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:02.280\n So it's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me\n\n2:47:02.280 --> 2:47:05.760\n and I can't wait until your podcast comes out.\n\n2:47:05.760 --> 2:47:08.280\n I'm a huge fan of podcasts, I'm a huge fan of you,\n\n2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:10.840\n and it's just an honor to know you\n\n2:47:10.840 --> 2:47:12.520\n and to get a chance, hopefully in the future,\n\n2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:13.760\n to work together with you.\n\n2:47:13.760 --> 2:47:17.360\n You're a brilliant man and you're doing amazing things.\n\n2:47:17.360 --> 2:47:22.240\n And I feel immensely honored to have met you,\n\n2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:25.880\n to now know you, and to start calling you a friend.\n\n2:47:25.880 --> 2:47:27.680\n Thank you for what you do for the world\n\n2:47:27.680 --> 2:47:32.320\n and for me included.\n\n2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:33.160\n Thank you, Matt.\n\n2:47:33.160 --> 2:47:34.640\n Take care.\n\n2:47:34.640 --> 2:47:37.080\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Matt Walker\n\n2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:40.720\n and thank you to Stamps.com, Squarespace,\n\n2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:43.560\n Letter Greens, BetterHelp, and Onnit.\n\n2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:46.960\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:49.160\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:47:49.160 --> 2:47:52.280\n from Nikola Tesla, who we discussed in this podcast\n\n2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:54.120\n as sleeping very few hours a night.\n\n2:47:54.120 --> 2:47:57.600\n All that was great in the past was ridiculed,\n\n2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:00.160\n condemned, combated, and suppressed,\n\n2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:02.760\n only to emerge all the more powerfully,\n\n2:48:02.760 --> 2:48:05.440\n all the more triumphantly from the struggle.\n\n2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:24.440\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
