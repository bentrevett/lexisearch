engineer\n\n00:06.000 --> 00:09.540\n previously at MIT and now the founder and CTO\n\n00:09.540 --> 00:11.160\n of Axion Systems,\n\n00:11.160 --> 00:14.880\n specializing in efficient space propulsion engines\n\n00:14.880 --> 00:16.840\n for satellites and spacecraft.\n\n00:16.840 --> 00:19.360\n So these are not the engines that get us\n\n00:19.360 --> 00:22.000\n from the ground on Earth out to space,\n\n00:22.000 --> 00:25.600\n but rather the engines that move us around in space\n\n00:25.600 --> 00:27.280\n once we get out there.\n\n00:27.280 --> 00:29.120\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:29.120 --> 00:31.320\n Monk Pack Low Carb Snacks,\n\n00:31.320 --> 00:33.360\n Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee,\n\n00:33.360 --> 00:35.880\n Blinkist, an app that summarizes books,\n\n00:35.880 --> 00:38.600\n and Sun Basket, meal delivery service.\n\n00:38.600 --> 00:41.640\n So the choice is snacks, caffeine,\n\n00:41.640 --> 00:44.120\n knowledge, or a delicious meal.\n\n00:44.120 --> 00:45.400\n Choose wisely, my friends,\n\n00:45.400 --> 00:48.120\n and if you wish, click the sponsor links below\n\n00:48.120 --> 00:51.320\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n00:51.320 --> 00:54.600\n As a side note, let me say something about Natalia's story.\n\n00:54.600 --> 00:57.240\n She has talked about how when she was young,\n\n00:57.240 --> 00:59.340\n she would often look up at the stars\n\n00:59.340 --> 01:01.400\n and dream of alien intelligences\n\n01:01.400 --> 01:03.840\n that one day we could communicate with.\n\n01:03.840 --> 01:06.520\n This moment of childlike cosmic curiosity\n\n01:06.520 --> 01:09.800\n is at the core of my own interest in space\n\n01:09.800 --> 01:12.480\n and extraterrestrial life and in general\n\n01:12.480 --> 01:15.600\n in artificial intelligence, science, and engineering.\n\n01:15.600 --> 01:19.320\n Amid the meetings and the papers and the career rat race\n\n01:19.320 --> 01:21.240\n and all the awards,\n\n01:21.240 --> 01:24.680\n let's not let ourselves lose that childlike wonder.\n\n01:24.680 --> 01:27.680\n Sadly, we're on Earth for only a very short time,\n\n01:27.680 --> 01:30.040\n so let's have fun solving some of the biggest puzzles\n\n01:30.040 --> 01:32.100\n in the universe while we're here.\n\n01:32.100 --> 01:34.520\n If you enjoy this

about space\n\n01:49.840 --> 01:52.600\n and also pondering the big existential question\n\n01:52.600 --> 01:56.760\n of whether there is or isn't intelligent life,\n\n01:56.760 --> 01:58.640\n intelligent alien civilizations out there.\n\n01:58.640 --> 02:00.080\n So what do you think?\n\n02:00.080 --> 02:02.120\n Do you think there's life out there?\n\n02:02.120 --> 02:03.560\n Intelligent life?\n\n02:03.560 --> 02:07.360\n Intelligent life, that's trickier.\n\n02:07.360 --> 02:11.120\n I think looking at the likelihood\n\n02:11.120 --> 02:15.920\n of a self replicating organism\n\n02:15.920 --> 02:20.440\n given how much time the universe has existed\n\n02:20.440 --> 02:23.360\n and how many stars with planets,\n\n02:23.360 --> 02:26.360\n I think it's likely that there's other life.\n\n02:27.240 --> 02:30.400\n Intelligent life, I'm hopeful,\n\n02:30.400 --> 02:34.420\n I'm a little discouraged that we haven't yet been in touch.\n\n02:34.420 --> 02:35.260\n As I'm hopeful.\n\n02:35.260 --> 02:37.000\n Allegedly, I mean, it's also.\n\n02:37.000 --> 02:39.520\n In our dimensions and so on, yeah.\n\n02:39.520 --> 02:42.180\n It's also possible that they have been in touch\n\n02:42.180 --> 02:46.120\n and we just haven't, we're too dumb to realize\n\n02:46.120 --> 02:47.480\n they're communicating with us.\n\n02:47.480 --> 02:51.300\n In whichever, it's the Carl Sagan idea\n\n02:51.300 --> 02:53.240\n that they may be communicating at a time scale\n\n02:53.240 --> 02:54.580\n that's totally different.\n\n02:54.580 --> 02:57.800\n Like their signals are in a totally different time scale\n\n02:57.800 --> 03:01.900\n or in a totally different kind of medium of communication.\n\n03:01.900 --> 03:06.900\n It could be our own, it could be the birth of human beings.\n\n03:10.960 --> 03:13.380\n Whatever the magic that makes us who we are,\n\n03:13.380 --> 03:15.440\n the collective intelligence thing,\n\n03:15.440 --> 03:17.680\n that could be aliens themselves.\n\n03:17.680 --> 03:19.540\n That could be the medium of communication.\n\n03:19.540 --> 03:21.320\n Like the nature of our consciousness\n\n03:21.320 --> 03:24.140\n and intelligence itself is the medium of communication.\n\n03:24.140 --> 03:28.920\n And like being able to ask the questions themselves,\n\n03:28.920 --> 03:30.480\n I've never thought of it that way.\n\n03:30.480 --> 03:32.480\n Like actually, yeah, asking the question\n\n03:32.480 --> 03:34.720\n whether aliens exist might be the very medium\n\n03:34.720 --> 03:35.920\n by which they communicate.\n\n03:35.920 --> 03:38.600\n It's like they send questions.\n\n03:38.600 --> 03:42.720\n So some of this like collective emergent behavior\n\n03:42.720 --> 03:44.480\n is the signal.\n\n03:44.480 --> 03:45.780\n Is the signal, yeah.\n\n03:46.640 --> 03:47.480\n So.\n\n03:47.480 --> 03:48.760\n That's interesting, yeah.\n\n03:48.760 --> 03:50.620\n Because maybe that's how we would communicate with,\n\n03:50.620 --> 03:53.480\n if you think about it, if we were way, way, way smarter,\n\n03:53.480 --> 03:56.400\n like a thousand years from now, we somehow survive,\n\n03:56.400 --> 03:58.280\n like how would we actually communicate?\n\n03:59.280 --> 04:03.220\n In a way that's like, if we broadcast the signal,\n\n04:05.040 --> 04:07.660\n and then it could somehow like percolate\n\n04:07.660 --> 04:09.080\n throughout the universe,\n\n04:09.080 --> 04:10.920\n like that signal having an impact on.\n\n04:10.920 --> 04:11.840\n Multiverse.\n\n04:11.840 --> 04:16.840\n Multiverse, of course, that would have a signal,\n\n04:16.960 --> 04:19.160\n an effect on the most possible,\n\n04:19.160 --> 04:21.240\n the highest number of possible civilizations.\n\n04:21.240 --> 04:22.520\n What would that signal be?\n\n04:22.520 --> 04:24.960\n It might not be like sending a few\n\n04:24.960 --> 04:28.160\n like stupid little hello world messages.\n\n04:28.160 --> 04:31.300\n It might be something more impactful.\n\n04:32.480 --> 04:36.280\n It's almost like impactful in a way\n\n04:36.280 --> 04:40.200\n where they don't have to have the capability to hear it.\n\n04:40.200 --> 04:42.760\n It like forces the message to have an impact.\n\n04:42.760 --> 04:43.720\n Right.\n\n04:43.720 --> 04:46.700\n My train of thought has never gone there,\n\n04:46.700 --> 04:47.560\n but I like it.\n\n04:47.560 --> 04:50.320\n And also somewhere in there,\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:53.860\n I think it's implied that something travels faster\n\n04:53.860 --> 04:58.080\n than the speed of light, which I'm also really hopeful for.\n\n04:58.080 --> 04:59.480\n Oh, you're hopeful.\n\n04:59.480 --> 05:01.700\n Are you excited by the possibility\n\n05:01.700 --> 05:03.960\n that there's intelligent life out there?\n\n05:03.960 --> 05:08.040\n Sort of, you work on the engineering side of things.\n\n05:08.040 --> 05:10.880\n It's this very kind of focused pursuit\n\n05:10.880 --> 05:15.800\n of moving things through space efficiently.\n\n05:15.800 --> 05:18.480\n But if you zoom out,\n\n05:18.480 --> 05:22.680\n one of the cool things that this enables us to do is find,\n\n05:22.680 --> 05:23.720\n get even intelligent life,\n\n05:23.720 --> 05:28.180\n just life on Mars or on Europa or something like that.\n\n05:28.180 --> 05:29.640\n Does that excite you?\n\n05:29.640 --> 05:30.800\n Does that scare you?\n\n05:31.760 --> 05:32.920\n Oh, it's very exciting.\n\n05:32.920 --> 05:36.840\n I mean, it's the whole reason I went into the field\n\n05:36.840 --> 05:41.840\n I'm in is to contribute to building the body of knowledge\n\n05:42.240 --> 05:46.200\n that we have as a species.\n\n05:46.200 --> 05:47.480\n So very exciting.\n\n05:47.480 --> 05:49.180\n Do you think there's life on Mars?\n\n05:50.680 --> 05:54.360\n Like no longer, well, already living,\n\n05:54.360 --> 05:57.300\n but currently living, but also no longer living,\n\n05:57.300 --> 05:59.840\n like that we might be able to find life,\n\n05:59.840 --> 06:03.560\n as some people suspect, basic microbial life.\n\n06:03.560 --> 06:07.360\n I'm not so sure about in our own solar system.\n\n06:07.360 --> 06:10.360\n And I do think it might be hard to untangle\n\n06:10.360 --> 06:15.360\n if we somehow contaminated other things as well.\n\n06:15.680 --> 06:19.160\n So I'm not sure about this close to home.\n\n06:19.160 --> 06:20.540\n That'd be really exciting.\n\n06:20.540 --> 06:21.380\n Yes.\n\n06:21.380 --> 06:24.000\n Do you think about the Drake equation much of like?\n\n06:24.000 --> 06:28.520\n That was what got me into all of this, yeah.\n\n06:28.520 --> 06:31.520\n Yeah, because one of the questions is how hard is it\n\n06:31.520 --> 06:34.280\n for life to start on a habitable planet?\n\n06:34.280 --> 06:36.280\n Like if you have a lot of the basic conditions,\n\n06:36.280 --> 06:39.860\n not exactly like Earth, but basic Earth like conditions,\n\n06:39.860 --> 06:41.440\n how hard is it for life to start?\n\n06:41.440 --> 06:44.960\n And if you find life on Mars or find life on Europa,\n\n06:46.200 --> 06:48.560\n that means it's way easier.\n\n06:48.560 --> 06:49.960\n That's a good thing to confirm\n\n06:49.960 --> 06:52.540\n that if you have a habitable planet,\n\n06:53.760 --> 06:55.560\n then there's going to be life.\n\n06:55.560 --> 06:58.840\n And that like immediately, that would be super exciting\n\n06:58.840 --> 07:02.680\n because that means there's like trillions of planets\n\n07:02.680 --> 07:04.640\n with basic life out there.\n\n07:04.640 --> 07:07.360\n Though of all the planets in our solar system,\n\n07:07.360 --> 07:09.400\n Earth is clearly the most habitable.\n\n07:09.400 --> 07:12.440\n So I would not be discouraged\n\n07:12.440 --> 07:17.040\n if we didn't find it on another planet in our solar system.\n\n07:17.040 --> 07:19.080\n True, and again, that life could look very different.\n\n07:19.080 --> 07:21.040\n It's habitable for Earth like life,\n\n07:21.040 --> 07:23.560\n but it could be totally different.\n\n07:23.560 --> 07:25.880\n I still think that trees are quite possibly\n\n07:25.880 --> 07:27.400\n more intelligent than humans,\n\n07:27.400 --> 07:31.280\n but their intelligence is carried out over a time scale\n\n07:31.280 --> 07:33.040\n that we're just not able to appreciate.\n\n07:33.040 --> 07:34.120\n Like they might be running\n\n07:34.120 --> 07:36.280\n the entirety of human civilization,\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:38.600\n and we're just like too dumb to realize\n\n07:38.600 --> 07:40.340\n that they're the smart ones.\n\n07:40.340 --> 07:43.720\n Maybe that's the alien message.\n\n07:43.720 --> 07:44.760\n It's in the trees.\n\n07:44.760 --> 07:46.480\n It's in the trees.\n\n07:47.720 --> 07:50.400\n Yeah, it's not in the monolith in the Utah desert.\n\n07:50.400 --> 07:51.240\n It's in the trees.\n\n07:51.240 --> 07:52.680\n Right, yeah.\n\n07:52.680 --> 07:55.080\n So let's go to space exploration.\n\n07:55.080 --> 07:57.200\n How do you think we would get humans to Mars?\n\n07:57.200 --> 08:01.320\n I think SpaceX and Elon Musk will be the ones\n\n08:01.320 --> 08:05.920\n that get the first human setting foot on Mars,\n\n08:06.920 --> 08:10.080\n and probably not that long from now\n\n08:10.080 --> 08:12.640\n from us having this conversation.\n\n08:12.640 --> 08:14.920\n Maybe we'll inflate his timeline a little bit,\n\n08:14.920 --> 08:19.160\n but I tend to believe the goals he sets.\n\n08:19.160 --> 08:22.320\n So I think that will happen relatively soon.\n\n08:22.320 --> 08:25.040\n As far as when and what it will take\n\n08:25.040 --> 08:28.800\n to get humans living there in a more permanent way,\n\n08:30.840 --> 08:34.720\n I have a glib answer, which is when we can invent\n\n08:34.720 --> 08:38.600\n a time machine to go back to the early Cold War,\n\n08:38.600 --> 08:43.240\n and instead of uniting around sending people to the moon,\n\n08:43.240 --> 08:45.760\n we pick Mars as the destination.\n\n08:45.760 --> 08:48.920\n So really, I say that because there's nothing\n\n08:49.920 --> 08:54.640\n truly scientifically or technologically impossible\n\n08:54.640 --> 08:57.720\n about doing that soon.\n\n08:57.720 --> 09:00.960\n It's more politically and financially,\n\n09:00.960 --> 09:04.480\n and those are the obstacles, I think, to that.\n\n09:04.480 --> 09:07.120\n Well, I wonder of when you colonize\n\n09:07.120 --> 09:10.760\n with more than, I say, five people on Mars,\n\n09:10.760 --> 09:14.960\n you have to start thinking about the kind of rules\n\n09:14.960 --> 09:18.520\n you have on Mars, and just speaking of the Cold War,\n\n09:18.520 --> 09:21.840\n who gets to own the land?\n\n09:21.840 --> 09:23.760\n You know, you start planting flags,\n\n09:23.760 --> 09:25.760\n and you start to make decisions.\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:30.120\n And like SpaceX says, it's probably a little bit trolly,\n\n09:30.120 --> 09:34.360\n but they have this nice paragraph in their contracts\n\n09:34.360 --> 09:39.360\n where it talks about that human governments on Earth\n\n09:41.760 --> 09:46.760\n or Earth governments have no jurisdiction on Mars.\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:50.280\n Like the rules, the Martians get to define their own rules.\n\n09:50.280 --> 09:53.920\n It sounds very much like the founding fathers\n\n09:53.920 --> 09:54.840\n for this country.\n\n09:54.840 --> 09:56.240\n That's the kind of language.\n\n09:57.360 --> 10:02.120\n It's interesting that that's in there,\n\n10:02.120 --> 10:07.120\n and it makes you think perhaps that needs to be leveraged.\n\n10:07.360 --> 10:10.040\n Like you have to be very clever about leveraging that\n\n10:10.040 --> 10:14.800\n to create a little bit of a Cold War feeling.\n\n10:14.800 --> 10:18.960\n It seems like we humans need a little bit of a competition.\n\n10:18.960 --> 10:21.200\n Do you think that's necessary to succeed\n\n10:21.200 --> 10:25.480\n and to get the necessary investment,\n\n10:25.480 --> 10:28.840\n or can the pure pursuit of science be enough?\n\n10:28.840 --> 10:30.920\n No, I think we're seeing right now\n\n10:30.920 --> 10:33.440\n the pure pursuit of science.\n\n10:33.440 --> 10:38.440\n I mean, that results in pretty tiny budgets for exploration.\n\n10:39.360 --> 10:43.920\n There has to be some disaster impending doom\n\n10:43.920 --> 10:48.280\n to get us onto another planet in a permanent way.\n\n10:48.280 --> 10:50.840\n I don't know, financially, I just don't know\n\n10:50.840 --> 10:54.120\n if the private sector can support that,\n\n10:55.000 --> 10:59.800\n but I don't wish that there is some catastrophe\n\n10:59.800 --> 11:03.840\n coming our way that spurs us to do that.\n\n11:03.840 --> 11:05.960\n Yeah, I'm unsure what the business model is\n\n11:05.960 --> 11:07.960\n for colonizing Mars.\n\n11:07.960 --> 11:09.160\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n11:09.160 --> 11:11.320\n Yeah, like there is for, we'll talk about satellites.\n\n11:11.320 --> 11:14.800\n There's probably a lot of business models around satellites,\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:18.160\n but there's not enough short term business.\n\n11:18.160 --> 11:19.520\n I guess that's how business works.\n\n11:19.520 --> 11:23.000\n Like you should have a path to making money\n\n11:23.000 --> 11:25.120\n in like the next 10 years.\n\n11:25.120 --> 11:29.720\n Well, and maybe even more broadly,\n\n11:29.720 --> 11:33.400\n and looping back to something we said earlier,\n\n11:33.400 --> 11:37.860\n I don't know that getting humans off this planet\n\n11:37.860 --> 11:42.040\n and spreading like bacteria\n\n11:42.040 --> 11:45.480\n is what we're supposed to be doing in the first place.\n\n11:45.480 --> 11:49.000\n So maybe we can go, but should we?\n\n11:49.000 --> 11:54.000\n And I'm probably an unusual person\n\n11:54.360 --> 11:56.280\n for thinking that in my industry\n\n11:56.280 --> 11:59.380\n because humans want to explore,\n\n11:59.380 --> 12:03.880\n but I almost wonder, are we putting unnecessary obstacles?\n\n12:03.880 --> 12:07.480\n Like we're very finicky biological things\n\n12:07.480 --> 12:12.120\n in the way of some more robotic or more\n\n12:12.120 --> 12:15.240\n silicon based exploration.\n\n12:15.240 --> 12:19.040\n And yeah, do we need to colonize and spread?\n\n12:19.040 --> 12:20.360\n I'm not sure.\n\n12:20.360 --> 12:22.900\n What do you think is the role of AI in space?\n\n12:22.900 --> 12:25.640\n Do you, in your work, again, we'll talk about it,\n\n12:25.640 --> 12:30.640\n but do you see more and more of the space vehicles,\n\n12:32.320 --> 12:37.320\n spacecraft being run by artificial intelligence systems?\n\n12:37.320 --> 12:39.120\n More than just like the flight control,\n\n12:39.120 --> 12:41.000\n but like the management?\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:43.880\n Yeah, I don't have a lot of color to the dreams\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:46.200\n I have about way in the future in AI,\n\n12:46.200 --> 12:51.200\n but I do think that removing,\n\n12:51.840 --> 12:54.760\n it's hard for humans to even make a trip to Mars,\n\n12:54.760 --> 12:58.060\n much less go anywhere farther than that.\n\n12:58.060 --> 13:01.680\n And I think we'll have more,\n\n13:03.400 --> 13:05.940\n again, I'm probably unusual in having these thoughts,\n\n13:05.940 --> 13:09.440\n but perhaps be able to generate more knowledge\n\n13:09.440 --> 13:13.000\n and understand more if we stop trying to send humans\n\n13:13.000 --> 13:17.780\n and instead, I don't know if we're talking about AI\n\n13:17.780 --> 13:20.700\n in a truly artificial intelligence way\n\n13:20.700 --> 13:23.840\n or AI as we kind of use it today,\n\n13:23.840 --> 13:28.840\n but maybe sending a Petri dish or two of like stem cells\n\n13:29.040 --> 13:32.000\n and some robotic handlers instead,\n\n13:32.000 --> 13:34.000\n if we still need to send our DNA\n\n13:34.000 --> 13:36.060\n because we're really stuck on that,\n\n13:36.060 --> 13:40.020\n but if not, maybe not even that Petri dish.\n\n13:40.020 --> 13:42.440\n So I see, I think what I'm saying is,\n\n13:42.440 --> 13:44.800\n I see a much bigger role in the future\n\n13:44.800 --> 13:47.080\n of AI for space exploration.\n\n13:47.080 --> 13:50.080\n It's kind of sad to think that,\n\n13:50.080 --> 13:53.680\n I mean, I'm sure we'll eventually send a spacecraft\n\n13:53.680 --> 13:55.600\n with efficient propulsion,\n\n13:55.600 --> 13:57.920\n like some of the stuff you work on out\n\n13:57.920 --> 14:00.680\n that travels just really far with some robots on it\n\n14:00.680 --> 14:05.000\n and with some DNA in a Petri dish,\n\n14:05.000 --> 14:08.640\n and then human civilization destroys itself,\n\n14:08.640 --> 14:11.280\n and then there'll just be this floating spacecraft\n\n14:11.280 --> 14:13.920\n that eventually gets somewhere or not.\n\n14:13.920 --> 14:16.560\n That's a sad thought, like this lonely spacecraft\n\n14:16.560 --> 14:18.620\n just kind of traveling through space\n\n14:18.620 --> 14:20.600\n and humans are all dead.\n\n14:20.600 --> 14:25.600\n Well, it depends on what the goal is, right?\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:29.640\n Another way to look at it is we've preserved,\n\n14:29.640 --> 14:33.000\n it's like a little time capsule of knowledge, DNA,\n\n14:33.000 --> 14:36.400\n that will outlive us.\n\n14:36.400 --> 14:37.240\n Well, that's beautiful.\n\n14:37.240 --> 14:38.060\n Yeah.\n\n14:39.920 --> 14:41.400\n It's how I sleep at night.\n\n14:41.400 --> 14:43.760\n So you also mentioned that you wanted to be an astronaut.\n\n14:43.760 --> 14:44.600\n Yes.\n\n14:45.560 --> 14:47.480\n So even though you said you're unusual\n\n14:47.480 --> 14:50.840\n in thinking like, it's nice here on Earth,\n\n14:50.840 --> 14:53.880\n and then we might want to be sending robots up there,\n\n14:53.880 --> 14:57.140\n you wanted to be a human that goes out there.\n\n14:57.140 --> 15:00.700\n Would you like to one day travel to Mars?\n\n15:01.580 --> 15:04.860\n You know, if it becomes sort of more open\n\n15:04.860 --> 15:07.340\n to civilian travel and that kind of thing?\n\n15:07.340 --> 15:09.980\n Like are you, like vacation wise,\n\n15:09.980 --> 15:12.480\n like if we're talking vacations,\n\n15:12.480 --> 15:15.420\n would you like to vacation on Earth or vacation on Mars?\n\n15:15.420 --> 15:20.260\n I wish that I had a better answer, but no.\n\n15:20.260 --> 15:23.580\n I wanted to be an astronaut because I,\n\n15:23.580 --> 15:28.480\n first of all, I like working in labs and doing experiments.\n\n15:28.480 --> 15:33.480\n And I wanted to go to like the coolest lab, the ISS,\n\n15:34.220 --> 15:37.020\n and do some experiments there.\n\n15:37.020 --> 15:39.660\n That's being decommissioned, which is sad,\n\n15:39.660 --> 15:42.260\n but you know, there will be others, I'm sure.\n\n15:43.380 --> 15:44.660\n The ISS is being decommissioned?\n\n15:44.660 --> 15:49.380\n Yes, I think by 2025, it's not going to be in use anymore.\n\n15:49.380 --> 15:51.000\n But I think there are other,\n\n15:51.000 --> 15:54.120\n there are private companies that are going to be putting up\n\n15:54.120 --> 15:55.320\n stations and things.\n\n15:55.320 --> 15:57.260\n So it's primarily like a research lab, essentially.\n\n15:57.260 --> 15:58.100\n Yes.\n\n15:58.100 --> 15:59.860\n A research lab in space, that's a cool way to say it.\n\n15:59.860 --> 16:02.420\n It's like the coolest possible research lobby.\n\n16:02.420 --> 16:03.700\n That's where I wanted to go.\n\n16:03.700 --> 16:08.700\n And now though, my risk profile has changed a little bit.\n\n16:08.980 --> 16:13.980\n I have three little ones and I won't be in the first\n\n16:15.880 --> 16:18.660\n thousand people to go to Mars, let's put it that way.\n\n16:18.660 --> 16:20.420\n Yeah, Earth is kind of nice.\n\n16:20.420 --> 16:23.980\n We have our troubles, but overall, it's pretty nice.\n\n16:23.980 --> 16:25.980\n Again, it's the Netflix.\n\n16:25.980 --> 16:28.540\n Okay, let's talk rockets.\n\n16:28.540 --> 16:31.940\n How does a rocket engine work or any kind of engine\n\n16:31.940 --> 16:36.820\n that can get us to space or float around in space?\n\n16:36.820 --> 16:40.500\n The basic principle is conservation of momentum.\n\n16:40.500 --> 16:45.500\n So you throw stuff out the back of the engine\n\n16:47.460 --> 16:50.060\n and that pushes the rocket and the spacecraft\n\n16:50.060 --> 16:51.020\n in the other direction.\n\n16:51.020 --> 16:56.020\n So there are two main types of rocket propulsion.\n\n16:57.900 --> 17:00.780\n The one people are more familiar with is chemical\n\n17:00.780 --> 17:03.460\n because it's loud and there's fire.\n\n17:04.500 --> 17:08.140\n And that's what's used for launch and is more televised.\n\n17:08.140 --> 17:12.700\n So in those types of systems, you usually have a fuel\n\n17:12.700 --> 17:15.920\n on an oxidizer and they react and combust\n\n17:15.920 --> 17:18.660\n and release stored chemical energy.\n\n17:18.660 --> 17:23.620\n And that energy heats the resultant gas\n\n17:23.620 --> 17:26.780\n and that's funneled out the back through a nozzle,\n\n17:26.780 --> 17:30.780\n directed out the back and then that momentum exchange\n\n17:30.780 --> 17:32.380\n pushes the spacecraft forward.\n\n17:32.380 --> 17:34.020\n Is there an interesting difference in liquid\n\n17:34.020 --> 17:36.740\n and solid fuel in those contexts?\n\n17:36.740 --> 17:38.700\n They're both lumped in the same.\n\n17:38.700 --> 17:43.100\n So chemical just means that the release of energy\n\n17:43.100 --> 17:45.680\n from those bonds essentially.\n\n17:45.680 --> 17:48.700\n So a solid fuel works the same way.\n\n17:48.700 --> 17:52.780\n And the other main category is electric propulsion.\n\n17:52.780 --> 17:54.500\n So instead of chemical energy,\n\n17:54.500 --> 17:56.820\n you're using electrical energy,\n\n17:56.820 --> 18:00.660\n usually from batteries or solar panels.\n\n18:00.660 --> 18:05.660\n And in this case, the stuff you're pushing out the back\n\n18:05.940 --> 18:07.740\n would be charged particles.\n\n18:07.740 --> 18:11.500\n So instead of combustion and heat,\n\n18:11.500 --> 18:13.820\n you end up with charged particles\n\n18:13.820 --> 18:16.220\n and you force them out the back of the spacecraft\n\n18:16.220 --> 18:20.180\n using either an electrostatic field or electromagnetic.\n\n18:21.680 --> 18:23.620\n But it's the same momentum exchange\n\n18:23.620 --> 18:25.460\n and same idea stuff out the back\n\n18:25.460 --> 18:27.820\n and everything else goes forward.\n\n18:27.820 --> 18:30.200\n Cool, so those are the big two categories.\n\n18:30.200 --> 18:35.200\n What's the difference maybe in the challenges of each,\n\n18:35.200 --> 18:40.200\n in the challenges of each, the use cases of each\n\n18:41.480 --> 18:45.000\n and how they're used today, the physics of each\n\n18:45.880 --> 18:48.280\n and where they're used, all that kind of stuff.\n\n18:48.280 --> 18:49.960\n Anything interesting about the two categories\n\n18:49.960 --> 18:51.520\n that distinguishes them?\n\n18:51.520 --> 18:56.520\n Besides the chemical one being the big sexy flames.\n\n18:56.720 --> 18:57.800\n Yeah, fire.\n\n18:57.800 --> 18:59.680\n Fire, yeah.\n\n18:59.680 --> 19:02.280\n Chemical is very well understood\n\n19:02.280 --> 19:06.980\n in its simplest form, it's like a firework.\n\n19:06.980 --> 19:11.080\n So it's been around since 400 BC or something like that.\n\n19:12.080 --> 19:15.040\n So that even the big engines are quite well understood.\n\n19:15.040 --> 19:20.040\n I think one of the last gaps there is probably\n\n19:23.640 --> 19:27.400\n what exactly are the products of combustion?\n\n19:27.400 --> 19:32.400\n Our modeling abilities kind of fall apart there\n\n19:32.520 --> 19:35.560\n because it's hot and gases are moving\n\n19:35.560 --> 19:40.560\n and you end up kind of having to venture\n\n19:41.200 --> 19:46.200\n into lots of different interdisciplinary fields of science\n\n19:46.840 --> 19:47.720\n to try to solve that.\n\n19:47.720 --> 19:51.920\n And that's quite complex, but we have pretty good models\n\n19:51.920 --> 19:54.120\n for some of the more like emergent behaviors\n\n19:54.120 --> 19:55.200\n of that system anyways.\n\n19:55.200 --> 20:00.200\n But that's I think one of the last unsolved pieces.\n\n20:00.640 --> 20:04.760\n And really the kind of what people care about there\n\n20:04.760 --> 20:07.760\n is making it more fuel efficient.\n\n20:07.760 --> 20:11.660\n So the chemical stuff, you can get a lot\n\n20:11.660 --> 20:15.360\n of instantaneous thrusts, but it's not very fuel efficient.\n\n20:15.360 --> 20:16.880\n It's much more fuel efficient to go\n\n20:16.880 --> 20:19.980\n with the electric type of propulsion.\n\n20:19.980 --> 20:23.260\n So that's where people spend a lot of their time\n\n20:23.260 --> 20:25.280\n is trying to make that more efficient in terms\n\n20:25.280 --> 20:28.320\n of thrust per unit of fuel.\n\n20:28.320 --> 20:31.860\n And then there's always considerations\n\n20:31.860 --> 20:33.700\n like heating and cooling.\n\n20:33.700 --> 20:36.360\n It's very hot, which is good if it heats the gases,\n\n20:36.360 --> 20:40.680\n but bad if it melts the rocket and things like that.\n\n20:40.680 --> 20:42.080\n So there's always a lot of work on heating\n\n20:42.080 --> 20:45.340\n and cooling and the engine cycles and things like that.\n\n20:46.520 --> 20:48.680\n And then on electric propulsion,\n\n20:48.680 --> 20:53.680\n I find it like much more refreshingly poorly understood.\n\n20:56.040 --> 20:57.240\n Lots more mysteries.\n\n20:57.240 --> 20:58.800\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n20:58.800 --> 21:01.920\n One of the classes I took in college,\n\n21:03.080 --> 21:06.120\n we spent 90% of the class on chemical propulsion\n\n21:06.120 --> 21:07.920\n and then the last 10% on electric.\n\n21:07.920 --> 21:09.520\n And the professor said like,\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:12.280\n we only sort of understand how it works,\n\n21:12.280 --> 21:13.880\n but it works kind of.\n\n21:13.880 --> 21:16.880\n And it's like, that's interesting.\n\n21:16.880 --> 21:20.120\n Yeah, and even an ion engine,\n\n21:20.120 --> 21:22.800\n which is probably one of the most straightforward\n\n21:22.800 --> 21:27.500\n because it's just an electrostatic engine,\n\n21:27.500 --> 21:29.900\n but it has this really awesome combination\n\n21:29.900 --> 21:34.160\n of like quantum mechanics and material science\n\n21:34.160 --> 21:38.560\n and fluid dynamics and electrostatics.\n\n21:38.560 --> 21:41.520\n And it's just very intriguing to me.\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:44.760\n First of all, can you actually zoom out even more?\n\n21:44.760 --> 21:47.960\n Like, cause you mentioned ion propulsion engine\n\n21:47.960 --> 21:51.040\n is a subset of electric.\n\n21:51.040 --> 21:53.520\n So like maybe, is there a categories of electric engines\n\n21:53.520 --> 21:55.760\n and then we can zoom in on ion propulsion?\n\n21:55.760 --> 21:57.720\n Yes, so sure.\n\n21:57.720 --> 22:01.520\n There's the two most kind of conventional types\n\n22:01.520 --> 22:03.680\n that have been around since the sixties\n\n22:03.680 --> 22:06.800\n are ion engines and hall thrusters.\n\n22:06.800 --> 22:08.840\n And ion engines are a little bit simpler\n\n22:08.840 --> 22:11.480\n because they don't use a magnetic field\n\n22:11.480 --> 22:12.880\n for generating thrust.\n\n22:12.880 --> 22:17.880\n And then there are also some other types of plasma engines,\n\n22:20.000 --> 22:21.960\n but that don't fit into those two categories.\n\n22:21.960 --> 22:23.640\n So just kind of other plasma,\n\n22:23.640 --> 22:27.600\n like a VASMIR engine, which we could get into.\n\n22:28.640 --> 22:32.640\n And then those are probably the main three categories\n\n22:32.640 --> 22:33.800\n that would be fun to talk about.\n\n22:33.800 --> 22:36.480\n Oh, and then of course, the category of engine\n\n22:36.480 --> 22:39.400\n that I work on, which has a lot of similarities\n\n22:39.400 --> 22:42.600\n to an ion engine, but could be considered its own class\n\n22:42.600 --> 22:44.560\n called a colloid thruster.\n\n22:44.560 --> 22:45.560\n Colloid, cool.\n\n22:45.560 --> 22:48.960\n Okay, so what is an ion propulsion, I imagine?\n\n22:48.960 --> 22:53.960\n Okay, so in an ion engine, you have an ionization chamber\n\n22:54.320 --> 22:57.640\n and you inject the propellant into that chamber.\n\n22:57.640 --> 23:02.640\n And this is usually a neutral gas like xenon or argon.\n\n23:03.640 --> 23:05.000\n So you inject that into the chamber\n\n23:05.000 --> 23:10.000\n and you also inject a stream of really high energy electrons\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:15.000\n and everything's just moving around very randomly in there.\n\n23:16.680 --> 23:21.320\n And the whole goal is to have one of those electrons\n\n23:21.320 --> 23:24.200\n collide with one of those neutral atoms\n\n23:24.200 --> 23:26.000\n and turn it into an ion.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.400\n So kick off a secondary electron and now you have...\n\n23:29.400 --> 23:30.240\n Plasma.\n\n23:30.240 --> 23:31.060\n Yes.\n\n23:31.060 --> 23:31.900\n Okay.\n\n23:31.900 --> 23:36.900\n And now you have a charged xenon or argon ion\n\n23:36.900 --> 23:39.020\n and more electrons and so on.\n\n23:39.020 --> 23:44.020\n And then some fraction of those ions will happen\n\n23:44.020 --> 23:47.620\n to make it to this downstream electric field\n\n23:47.620 --> 23:50.860\n that we set up between two grids with holes in them.\n\n23:50.860 --> 23:55.220\n And in terms of area, the same amount of those ions\n\n23:55.220 --> 23:58.740\n also runs into the walls and lose their charge\n\n23:58.740 --> 24:01.420\n and that's where some of the inefficiencies come in.\n\n24:01.420 --> 24:05.420\n But the very lucky few make it to the downstream\n\n24:05.420 --> 24:09.540\n and the very lucky few make it to those holes in that grid\n\n24:09.540 --> 24:11.740\n and there are two grids actually\n\n24:11.740 --> 24:14.980\n and you apply a voltage differential between them\n\n24:14.980 --> 24:17.700\n and that sets up an electric field.\n\n24:17.700 --> 24:20.580\n And a charged particle in an electric field\n\n24:20.580 --> 24:21.780\n creates a force.\n\n24:21.780 --> 24:25.460\n And so those ions are accelerated out the back of the engine\n\n24:25.460 --> 24:30.460\n and the reaction force is what pushes the spacecraft forward.\n\n24:30.460 --> 24:35.460\n If you're following along and tallying these charges,\n\n24:35.540 --> 24:39.740\n now we've just sent a positive beam of ions\n\n24:39.740 --> 24:44.020\n out the back of the spacecraft and for our purposes here,\n\n24:44.020 --> 24:45.700\n the spacecraft is neutral.\n\n24:45.700 --> 24:48.980\n So eventually those ions will come back\n\n24:48.980 --> 24:51.560\n and hit the spacecraft because it's a positive beam.\n\n24:51.560 --> 24:56.300\n So you also have to have an external cathode producer\n\n24:56.300 --> 24:58.820\n of electrons outside the engine\n\n24:58.820 --> 25:02.300\n that pumps electrons into that beam and neutralizes that.\n\n25:02.300 --> 25:03.980\n So now it's net neutral everywhere\n\n25:03.980 --> 25:05.300\n and it won't come back to the spacecraft.\n\n25:05.300 --> 25:07.780\n So that's an ion engine.\n\n25:07.780 --> 25:09.780\n What temperature are we talking about here?\n\n25:09.780 --> 25:13.060\n So in terms of like the chemical based engines,\n\n25:13.060 --> 25:14.860\n those are super hot.\n\n25:14.860 --> 25:16.740\n You mentioned plasma here.\n\n25:16.740 --> 25:18.140\n How hot does this thing get?\n\n25:20.020 --> 25:22.140\n I mean, is that an interesting thing to talk about\n\n25:22.140 --> 25:25.260\n in a sense that is that an interesting distinction\n\n25:25.260 --> 25:28.300\n or is the heat, I mean, it's all gonna be hot.\n\n25:28.300 --> 25:31.020\n No, so it's important especially\n\n25:31.020 --> 25:32.820\n for some of these smaller satellites\n\n25:32.820 --> 25:35.300\n people are into launching these days.\n\n25:35.300 --> 25:39.260\n So it's important because you have the plasma\n\n25:39.260 --> 25:42.380\n but also those high energy electrons are hot\n\n25:42.380 --> 25:46.620\n and if you have a lot of those that are going into the walls\n\n25:46.620 --> 25:48.200\n you do have to care about the temperature.\n\n25:48.200 --> 25:52.540\n So I'm having trouble remembering off the top of my head.\n\n25:52.540 --> 25:54.960\n I think they're at like a hundred electron volts\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:56.820\n in terms of the electron energy\n\n25:56.820 --> 25:59.620\n and then I'd have to remember how to convert that\n\n25:59.620 --> 26:00.700\n into Kelvin.\n\n26:00.700 --> 26:02.620\n Can you stick your hand in it?\n\n26:02.620 --> 26:03.660\n Not move the temperature.\n\n26:03.660 --> 26:05.660\n Not recommended, yeah.\n\n26:05.660 --> 26:07.700\n So what's a colloid engine?\n\n26:07.700 --> 26:12.700\n So the same rocket people that came up with these ideas\n\n26:16.180 --> 26:19.540\n for electric propulsion probably in the middle\n\n26:19.540 --> 26:24.540\n of last century also realized that there's one more place\n\n26:24.540 --> 26:28.940\n to get charged particles from if you're going\n\n26:28.940 --> 26:30.340\n to be using electric propulsion.\n\n26:30.340 --> 26:33.220\n So you can take a gas and you can ionize it\n\n26:33.220 --> 26:37.500\n but there are also some liquids particularly ionic liquids\n\n26:37.500 --> 26:41.020\n which is what we use that you also can use\n\n26:41.020 --> 26:43.740\n as a source of ions and if you have ions\n\n26:43.740 --> 26:45.580\n and you put them in a field you generate a force.\n\n26:45.580 --> 26:50.580\n So they recognize that but part of being able\n\n26:51.220 --> 26:53.380\n to leverage that technique is being able\n\n26:53.380 --> 26:57.340\n to kind of manipulate those liquids on a scale\n\n26:57.340 --> 27:01.260\n of nanometers or very few microns.\n\n27:01.260 --> 27:05.320\n So the diameter of a human hair or something like that\n\n27:05.320 --> 27:08.660\n and in the 50s there was no way to do that.\n\n27:08.660 --> 27:10.500\n So they wrote about it in some books\n\n27:10.500 --> 27:12.900\n and then it kind of died for a little bit\n\n27:12.900 --> 27:17.900\n and then with silicon mems, computer processors\n\n27:17.940 --> 27:21.460\n and when foundry started becoming more ubiquitous\n\n27:21.460 --> 27:26.460\n and my advisor started at MIT kind of put those ideas\n\n27:28.340 --> 27:31.680\n back together and was like, hey actually there's now a way\n\n27:31.680 --> 27:35.080\n to build this and bring this other technique to life.\n\n27:36.160 --> 27:40.880\n And so the way that you actually get the ions\n\n27:40.880 --> 27:43.980\n out of those liquids is you put the liquid\n\n27:43.980 --> 27:47.220\n in again a strong electric field\n\n27:47.220 --> 27:50.220\n and the electric field stresses the liquid\n\n27:50.220 --> 27:51.800\n and you keep increasing the field\n\n27:51.800 --> 27:56.800\n and eventually the liquid will assume a conical shape.\n\n27:57.060 --> 28:01.200\n It's when the electric field pressure that's pulling on it\n\n28:01.200 --> 28:04.740\n exactly balances the liquid's own restoring force\n\n28:04.740 --> 28:06.900\n which is its surface tension.\n\n28:06.900 --> 28:10.080\n So you have this balance and the liquid assumes a cone\n\n28:10.080 --> 28:12.400\n when it's perfectly balanced like that\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:16.340\n and at the tip of a cone the radius of curvature\n\n28:16.340 --> 28:18.500\n goes to zero right at the tip\n\n28:18.500 --> 28:23.500\n and the electric field right at the tip of a sharp object\n\n28:24.540 --> 28:29.540\n would go to infinity because it goes as one over the radius\n\n28:31.200 --> 28:33.180\n and one over the radius squared\n\n28:33.180 --> 28:37.420\n and instead of the electric field going to infinity\n\n28:37.420 --> 28:40.940\n and maybe like generating a wormhole or something,\n\n28:40.940 --> 28:44.260\n a jet of ions instead starts issuing\n\n28:44.260 --> 28:46.220\n from the tip of that liquid.\n\n28:46.220 --> 28:47.740\n So the field becomes strong enough there\n\n28:47.740 --> 28:50.460\n that you can pull ions out of the liquid.\n\n28:50.460 --> 28:51.620\n What is the liquid?\n\n28:51.620 --> 28:54.580\n We're talking about, there's a bunch of different ones.\n\n28:54.580 --> 28:58.460\n You can do it with different types of liquids.\n\n28:58.460 --> 29:02.020\n It depends on how easily you can free ions\n\n29:02.020 --> 29:06.480\n from their neighbors and if it has enough surface tension\n\n29:06.480 --> 29:09.040\n so that you can build up a high enough electric field\n\n29:09.040 --> 29:12.340\n but what we use are called ionic liquids\n\n29:12.340 --> 29:13.960\n and they're really just positive.\n\n29:13.960 --> 29:17.100\n They're very similar to salts but they happen to be liquid\n\n29:17.100 --> 29:19.380\n over a really wide range of temperatures.\n\n29:19.380 --> 29:21.540\n This sounds like really cool.\n\n29:21.540 --> 29:25.140\n Okay, so how big is the cone we're talking about?\n\n29:25.140 --> 29:27.620\n What's the size of this cone that generates the ions?\n\n29:27.620 --> 29:30.520\n So if you have a cone that's emitting pure ions,\n\n29:33.100 --> 29:35.100\n I can't remember if it's the radius or diameter\n\n29:35.100 --> 29:39.140\n but that emission is happening from,\n\n29:39.140 --> 29:41.820\n of that cone is something like 20 nanometers.\n\n29:41.820 --> 29:45.340\n Oh, I was imagining something slightly bigger\n\n29:45.340 --> 29:49.220\n but so like this is tiny, tiny.\n\n29:49.220 --> 29:52.100\n Hence the only being able to do it recently.\n\n29:52.100 --> 29:52.940\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n29:52.940 --> 29:55.700\n So this is all controlled by a computer, I guess.\n\n29:55.700 --> 30:00.460\n Like, or like, how do you create a cone\n\n30:00.460 --> 30:04.020\n that generates ions at a scale of nanometers exactly?\n\n30:04.020 --> 30:08.460\n So the kind of main trick to making this work\n\n30:08.460 --> 30:12.620\n is that physically we manufacture hundreds\n\n30:12.620 --> 30:16.320\n or thousands of sharp structures and then supply the liquid\n\n30:16.320 --> 30:17.160\n to the tips.\n\n30:17.160 --> 30:20.220\n So that does a few things.\n\n30:20.220 --> 30:23.020\n It makes sure that we know where the ion beams are forming.\n\n30:23.020 --> 30:25.260\n So we can put holes in the grid above them\n\n30:25.260 --> 30:27.940\n to let them actually leave instead of hitting, right?\n\n30:27.940 --> 30:29.380\n Cool.\n\n30:29.380 --> 30:32.980\n But it also reduces the actual field we have,\n\n30:32.980 --> 30:35.280\n the voltage we have to apply to create that field\n\n30:35.280 --> 30:36.780\n because the field will be much stronger\n\n30:36.780 --> 30:41.780\n if we can already give the liquid a tip to form on.\n\n30:41.780 --> 30:45.260\n And those tips we form have radii of curvature\n\n30:46.380 --> 30:50.900\n on the order of probably like single microns.\n\n30:50.900 --> 30:53.440\n So we are working at a little bit larger scale\n\n30:53.440 --> 30:55.660\n but once we create that support\n\n30:55.660 --> 30:57.940\n and the electric field can be focused at that tip,\n\n30:57.940 --> 31:00.100\n then the tiny little cone can form on top of that.\n\n31:00.100 --> 31:01.980\n So wait, so there's something in them,\n\n31:01.980 --> 31:04.680\n there's already like a hard material\n\n31:04.680 --> 31:07.140\n that like gives you the base for the cone\n\n31:07.140 --> 31:08.700\n and then you're pouring like liquid over it,\n\n31:08.700 --> 31:10.140\n whatever the heck. From the bottom, yeah.\n\n31:10.140 --> 31:12.020\n It's porous, so we actually supply it\n\n31:12.020 --> 31:13.540\n from the back of the chip and then it wicks.\n\n31:13.540 --> 31:17.020\n And then liquid forms on top on that structure.\n\n31:17.020 --> 31:20.540\n And then you somehow make it like super sharp, the liquid,\n\n31:20.540 --> 31:22.500\n so the ions can leave.\n\n31:24.860 --> 31:28.500\n And then we've applied that field to get those ions\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:31.620\n and that same field then accelerates them.\n\n31:31.620 --> 31:33.940\n That's awesome. And there's like a bunch of these?\n\n31:33.940 --> 31:37.460\n Yeah, I should have brought something.\n\n31:37.460 --> 31:38.740\n So we...\n\n31:38.740 --> 31:41.260\n You could just pretend that you have some nanometer cones\n\n31:41.260 --> 31:42.100\n on a table here.\n\n31:42.100 --> 31:44.980\n So actually, you know, kind of about this scale,\n\n31:44.980 --> 31:47.620\n we build, we call them thruster chips\n\n31:47.620 --> 31:49.980\n and it's just a convenient form factor\n\n31:49.980 --> 31:51.820\n and it's a square centimeter.\n\n31:51.820 --> 31:53.740\n And on each square centimeter today,\n\n31:53.740 --> 31:56.700\n we have about 500 of the actual physical,\n\n31:56.700 --> 31:59.420\n we call them emitters, those physical cones.\n\n32:00.500 --> 32:04.500\n And we're working on increasing that by a factor of four\n\n32:04.500 --> 32:05.660\n in the coming months.\n\n32:05.660 --> 32:07.260\n In size or in the density?\n\n32:07.260 --> 32:10.340\n In number, in the density, the number of emitters\n\n32:10.340 --> 32:12.300\n within the same square centimeter chip.\n\n32:12.300 --> 32:14.380\n So that thing, cause I think I've seen pictures of you\n\n32:14.380 --> 32:15.820\n with like a tiny thing in your hand.\n\n32:15.820 --> 32:17.300\n That must be the...\n\n32:17.300 --> 32:19.860\n Okay, so that's an engine.\n\n32:19.860 --> 32:24.380\n So that is kind of the ionization chamber\n\n32:24.380 --> 32:26.100\n and thrust producing part of it.\n\n32:26.100 --> 32:28.900\n What's not shown, you know, in that picture\n\n32:29.860 --> 32:31.740\n is the propellant tank.\n\n32:31.740 --> 32:34.380\n So we can keep supplying more and more of the liquid\n\n32:34.380 --> 32:36.740\n to those emission sites.\n\n32:36.740 --> 32:40.540\n And then we also provide a power electronic system\n\n32:40.540 --> 32:41.820\n that talks to the spacecraft\n\n32:41.820 --> 32:43.820\n and turns our device on and off.\n\n32:43.820 --> 32:45.740\n So that's the colloid engine.\n\n32:45.740 --> 32:47.620\n That's the core of the colloid engine.\n\n32:47.620 --> 32:50.380\n It's, the way I've been talking about it,\n\n32:50.380 --> 32:53.940\n it's more of ion electrospray colloid\n\n32:55.580 --> 33:00.500\n tends to mean like liquid droplets coming off of the jet.\n\n33:00.500 --> 33:03.380\n But if you make smaller and smaller cones,\n\n33:03.380 --> 33:04.820\n you get pure ions.\n\n33:04.820 --> 33:07.460\n So we're kind of like a subset of colloid, yes.\n\n33:07.460 --> 33:10.700\n What aspects of this, you said that it's been full\n\n33:10.700 --> 33:13.260\n of mysteries from the physics perspective.\n\n33:13.260 --> 33:15.820\n What aspects of this are understood\n\n33:15.820 --> 33:19.660\n and what are still full of mystery?\n\n33:19.660 --> 33:24.660\n Yeah, recently we've been understanding\n\n33:24.740 --> 33:29.740\n the kind of instabilities and stable regimes of,\n\n33:30.660 --> 33:32.660\n you know, how much liquid do you supply\n\n33:32.660 --> 33:34.540\n and what field do you apply?\n\n33:34.540 --> 33:37.980\n And why is it flickering on and off?\n\n33:37.980 --> 33:39.780\n Or why does it have these weird behaviors?\n\n33:39.780 --> 33:41.940\n So that's, in the past just couple of years,\n\n33:41.940 --> 33:45.900\n that's become much more understood.\n\n33:47.100 --> 33:49.260\n I think the two areas that come to mind\n\n33:49.260 --> 33:53.460\n as far as not as well understood are\n\n33:54.660 --> 33:57.340\n the boundary between, you know, you have,\n\n33:58.660 --> 34:03.060\n we actually use kind of big molecular ions.\n\n34:03.060 --> 34:06.740\n And if you're looking at the molecular scale,\n\n34:07.700 --> 34:10.460\n you have, you know, some ions that you've extracted\n\n34:10.460 --> 34:12.820\n and they're in this electric field.\n\n34:12.820 --> 34:16.180\n One ion, you know, it's a big molecule,\n\n34:16.180 --> 34:19.220\n it's getting energy from the electric field.\n\n34:19.220 --> 34:21.780\n And some of that energy is going into the bonds\n\n34:21.780 --> 34:24.260\n and making it vibrate and doing weird things to it.\n\n34:24.260 --> 34:26.460\n Sometimes it breaks them apart.\n\n34:26.460 --> 34:30.460\n And then zooming out to the whole beam,\n\n34:30.460 --> 34:34.740\n the beam has some behaviors as this beam of ions.\n\n34:34.740 --> 34:38.100\n And there's a big gap between what are those,\n\n34:38.100 --> 34:40.540\n how do you connect those?\n\n34:40.540 --> 34:42.260\n And how do we understand that better\n\n34:42.260 --> 34:44.460\n so that we can understand the beam performance\n\n34:44.460 --> 34:45.780\n of the engine?\n\n34:45.780 --> 34:48.740\n Is that a theory question or is it an engineering question?\n\n34:48.740 --> 34:50.140\n Theory, definitely.\n\n34:50.140 --> 34:54.380\n We're, Axion is a startup and we're more in the business\n\n34:54.380 --> 34:59.380\n of building and testing and observing and characterizing.\n\n34:59.380 --> 35:03.060\n And we're not really diving much into that theory right now.\n\n35:03.060 --> 35:06.300\n Okay, zooming out a little bit on the physics,\n\n35:06.300 --> 35:08.300\n apologize for the way too big of a question,\n\n35:08.300 --> 35:13.300\n but to you from either, you mentioned Axion is,\n\n35:13.700 --> 35:16.740\n you know, more of sort of an engineering endeavor, right?\n\n35:16.740 --> 35:19.740\n But from a perspective of physics in general,\n\n35:19.740 --> 35:22.500\n science in general, or the side of engineering,\n\n35:22.500 --> 35:24.700\n what do you think is the most, to you,\n\n35:24.700 --> 35:26.980\n like beautiful and captivating\n\n35:26.980 --> 35:29.740\n and inspiring idea in this space?\n\n35:30.620 --> 35:33.420\n In this space, and then I'm gonna zoom out\n\n35:33.420 --> 35:35.660\n a little bit more, but in this space,\n\n35:35.660 --> 35:40.660\n I keep butting up against material science questions.\n\n35:41.780 --> 35:45.020\n So I, over the past 10 years,\n\n35:45.020 --> 35:49.660\n I feel like every problem or interesting thing\n\n35:49.660 --> 35:52.460\n I want to work on, if you dig deep enough,\n\n35:52.460 --> 35:55.380\n you end up in material science land,\n\n35:55.380 --> 35:57.860\n which I find kind of exciting\n\n35:57.860 --> 36:00.740\n and it makes me want to dig in more there.\n\n36:00.740 --> 36:05.740\n And I was just, you know, even for our technology,\n\n36:06.340 --> 36:09.140\n when we have to move the propellant from the tank\n\n36:09.140 --> 36:12.820\n to the tip of the emitters, we rely a lot on capillary action\n\n36:12.820 --> 36:15.980\n and you're getting into wetting and surface energies.\n\n36:15.980 --> 36:17.900\n At a scale of like nano scale.\n\n36:17.900 --> 36:22.180\n Yeah, I mean, it's, if you look further, it's quantum too,\n\n36:22.180 --> 36:25.220\n but it all is, you know,\n\n36:25.220 --> 36:27.860\n a capillary action at the quantum level.\n\n36:27.860 --> 36:32.780\n Yeah, so I would, it all comes back to me to, you know,\n\n36:32.780 --> 36:35.420\n material science, there's so much we don't understand\n\n36:35.420 --> 36:40.420\n at these sizes and I find that inspiring and exciting.\n\n36:43.340 --> 36:45.980\n And then more broadly, you know,\n\n36:45.980 --> 36:49.980\n I remember when I learned that the same equation\n\n36:49.980 --> 36:53.740\n that describes flow over an airfoil\n\n36:53.740 --> 36:57.420\n is used to price options, the Black Scholes equation,\n\n36:57.420 --> 37:01.420\n and it's, you know, just a partial differential equation,\n\n37:01.420 --> 37:06.420\n but that kind of connectedness of the universe,\n\n37:06.500 --> 37:09.300\n you know, I don't want to use options pricing\n\n37:09.300 --> 37:11.540\n and the universe in the same, but you know what I mean,\n\n37:11.540 --> 37:15.300\n this connectedness I find really magical.\n\n37:15.300 --> 37:17.820\n Yeah, the patterns that mathematics reveals\n\n37:17.820 --> 37:20.340\n seems to echo in a bunch of different places.\n\n37:20.340 --> 37:21.180\n Yes.\n\n37:21.180 --> 37:22.260\n Yeah, there's just weirdness.\n\n37:22.260 --> 37:25.060\n It's like, it really makes you think,\n\n37:25.060 --> 37:27.260\n I think you're definitely living in a simulation,\n\n37:27.260 --> 37:29.020\n like whoever programmed it.\n\n37:29.020 --> 37:30.380\n I like that that's your conclusion.\n\n37:30.380 --> 37:34.340\n Is using like shortcuts to program it,\n\n37:34.340 --> 37:36.940\n like they didn't, they're just copying and pasting some codes\n\n37:36.940 --> 37:38.180\n for the different parts.\n\n37:38.180 --> 37:41.540\n Yeah, think of something new or just paste from over there.\n\n37:41.540 --> 37:42.780\n They won't notice.\n\n37:42.780 --> 37:45.780\n My conclusion from that was I'm gonna go interview\n\n37:45.780 --> 37:49.540\n for a finance job, so I had like a little detour.\n\n37:49.540 --> 37:51.700\n That's the backup option.\n\n37:51.700 --> 37:56.020\n So in terms of using call it engines,\n\n37:56.020 --> 37:59.260\n what's an interesting difference between a propulsion\n\n37:59.260 --> 38:02.340\n of a rocket from earth when you're standing\n\n38:02.340 --> 38:06.100\n on the ground to orbit and then the kind of propulsion\n\n38:06.100 --> 38:08.420\n necessary for once you get out to orbit\n\n38:08.420 --> 38:12.800\n or to like deep space to move around.\n\n38:13.980 --> 38:18.980\n Yes, the reason you can't use an engine like mine\n\n38:18.980 --> 38:23.980\n to get off the ground is, the thrust it generates\n\n38:24.500 --> 38:27.180\n is instantaneous thrust is very small,\n\n38:27.180 --> 38:31.380\n but if you have the time and can accumulate\n\n38:31.380 --> 38:33.780\n that acceleration, you can still reach speeds\n\n38:33.780 --> 38:37.140\n that are very interesting for exploration\n\n38:37.140 --> 38:40.140\n and even for missions with humans on them.\n\n38:41.540 --> 38:45.860\n An interesting direction I think we need to go\n\n38:45.860 --> 38:50.860\n as humans exploring space is the power supplies\n\n38:51.820 --> 38:55.140\n for electric propulsion are limiting us\n\n38:55.140 --> 38:58.940\n in that solar panels are really inefficient\n\n38:58.940 --> 39:01.060\n and bulky and batteries.\n\n39:01.060 --> 39:04.420\n I don't know when anybody's ever gonna improve\n\n39:04.420 --> 39:05.860\n battery technology.\n\n39:05.860 --> 39:07.860\n I know a lot of people that work on that.\n\n39:09.180 --> 39:14.180\n And nuclear power, we could have a lot more powerful\n\n39:14.420 --> 39:15.660\n electric propulsion system.\n\n39:15.660 --> 39:17.940\n So they would be extremely fuel efficient,\n\n39:17.940 --> 39:20.940\n but more instantaneous thrust to do more interesting\n\n39:20.940 --> 39:25.260\n missions if we could start launching more nuclear systems.\n\n39:25.260 --> 39:29.660\n So like something that's powered, nuclear powered,\n\n39:29.660 --> 39:31.420\n that's the right way to say it.\n\n39:31.420 --> 39:32.720\n Yeah.\n\n39:32.720 --> 39:36.420\n But is in a small enough container that could be launched?\n\n39:36.420 --> 39:41.420\n Yeah, so I mean, as a world we do launch spacecraft\n\n39:42.100 --> 39:45.180\n with nuclear power systems on board,\n\n39:45.180 --> 39:47.780\n but size is one consideration.\n\n39:47.780 --> 39:49.140\n It hasn't been a big focus.\n\n39:49.140 --> 39:53.940\n So the reactors and the heaters and everything are bulky.\n\n39:53.940 --> 39:56.300\n And so they're really only suitable for some\n\n39:56.300 --> 39:59.900\n of the much bigger interplanetary stuff.\n\n39:59.900 --> 40:03.340\n So that's one issue, but then it's a whole like rat's nest\n\n40:03.340 --> 40:06.340\n of political stuff as well.\n\n40:06.340 --> 40:10.180\n I heard, I think Elon described or somebody,\n\n40:10.180 --> 40:13.300\n I think it was Elon that described the EV to all\n\n40:13.300 --> 40:17.700\n like electrical, vertical takeoff and landing vehicles.\n\n40:17.700 --> 40:21.220\n So basically saying rockets, obviously Elon is interested\n\n40:21.220 --> 40:22.580\n in electric vehicles, right?\n\n40:22.580 --> 40:27.580\n But he said that rockets can't, in the near term,\n\n40:27.940 --> 40:30.300\n it doesn't make sense for them to be electrical.\n\n40:32.540 --> 40:36.020\n What, do you see a world with the rockets that we use\n\n40:36.020 --> 40:39.500\n to get into orbit are also electric based?\n\n40:39.500 --> 40:43.660\n It's possible, you can produce the thrust levels you need,\n\n40:43.660 --> 40:46.940\n but you need this, a much bigger power supply.\n\n40:46.940 --> 40:49.180\n And I think that would be nuclear.\n\n40:49.180 --> 40:52.380\n And the only way people have been able to launch them at all\n\n40:52.380 --> 40:57.020\n is that they're in a 100 times redundancy safe mode\n\n40:57.020 --> 40:59.060\n while they're being launched and they're not turned on\n\n40:59.060 --> 41:00.620\n until they're farther off.\n\n41:00.620 --> 41:04.020\n So if you were to actually try to use it on launch,\n\n41:04.020 --> 41:06.680\n I think a lot of people would still have an issue with that,\n\n41:06.680 --> 41:08.180\n but someday.\n\n41:08.180 --> 41:11.020\n It's an interesting concept, nuclear.\n\n41:11.020 --> 41:13.420\n It seems like people, like everybody that works\n\n41:13.420 --> 41:16.740\n on nuclear power has shown how safe it is\n\n41:16.740 --> 41:18.380\n as a source of energy.\n\n41:18.380 --> 41:23.380\n And yet we are, seem to be, I mean, based on the history,\n\n41:23.740 --> 41:26.180\n based on the excellent HBO series,\n\n41:26.180 --> 41:28.220\n I'm Russian with a Chernobyl.\n\n41:28.220 --> 41:31.220\n It seems like we have our risk estimation\n\n41:31.220 --> 41:35.580\n about this particular power source is drastically inaccurate,\n\n41:35.580 --> 41:39.660\n but that's a fascinating idea that we would use nuclear\n\n41:39.660 --> 41:44.220\n as a source for our vehicles and not just in outer space.\n\n41:44.220 --> 41:45.060\n That's cool.\n\n41:45.060 --> 41:45.980\n I'm gonna have to look into that.\n\n41:45.980 --> 41:47.000\n That's super interesting.\n\n41:47.000 --> 41:50.980\n Well, just last year, Trump eased up a little bit\n\n41:50.980 --> 41:55.140\n on the regulations and NASA and hopefully others\n\n41:55.140 --> 41:57.860\n are starting to pick up on the development.\n\n41:57.860 --> 42:00.260\n So now is a good time to look into it\n\n42:00.260 --> 42:02.340\n because there's actually some movement.\n\n42:02.340 --> 42:05.660\n Is that a hope for you to explore different energy sources\n\n42:05.660 --> 42:09.180\n that the entirety of the vehicle uses something\n\n42:09.180 --> 42:13.060\n like the entirety of the propulsion systems\n\n42:13.060 --> 42:16.980\n for all aspects of the vehicle's life travel\n\n42:16.980 --> 42:19.000\n is the same or electric?\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:20.460\n Is it possible for it to be the same?\n\n42:20.460 --> 42:24.340\n Like the colloid engine being used for everything?\n\n42:24.340 --> 42:27.440\n You could, and you would have to do it in the same way\n\n42:27.440 --> 42:29.580\n we do different stages of rockets now\n\n42:29.580 --> 42:34.580\n where once you've used up an engine or a stage,\n\n42:34.820 --> 42:36.740\n you let it go because there's really no point\n\n42:36.740 --> 42:37.580\n in holding onto it.\n\n42:37.580 --> 42:41.140\n So I wouldn't necessarily want to use the same engine\n\n42:41.140 --> 42:42.860\n for the whole thing, but the same technology\n\n42:42.860 --> 42:45.060\n I think would be interesting.\n\n42:45.060 --> 42:46.260\n Okay, so it's possible.\n\n42:46.260 --> 42:47.780\n All right, but in terms of.\n\n42:47.780 --> 42:49.420\n Yeah, it comes down to the power source.\n\n42:49.420 --> 42:51.100\n The power source, that's really interesting.\n\n42:51.100 --> 42:52.540\n But for the current power sources\n\n42:52.540 --> 42:55.020\n and its current use cases, what's the use case\n\n42:55.020 --> 42:58.940\n for electric, like the colloid engine?\n\n42:58.940 --> 43:01.600\n Can you talk about where they're used today?\n\n43:01.600 --> 43:06.600\n Sure, so chemical engines are still used quite a bit\n\n43:06.600 --> 43:09.340\n once you're in orbit, but that's also\n\n43:09.340 --> 43:12.500\n where you might choose instead to use an electric system\n\n43:12.500 --> 43:15.460\n and what people do with them.\n\n43:15.460 --> 43:18.620\n And this includes the ion engines and hall thrusters\n\n43:18.620 --> 43:22.580\n and our engine is basically any maneuvering you need to do\n\n43:22.580 --> 43:24.060\n once you're dropped off.\n\n43:24.060 --> 43:29.060\n Even if your only goal was to just stay in your orbit\n\n43:30.140 --> 43:32.540\n and not move for the life of your mission,\n\n43:32.540 --> 43:34.620\n you need propulsion to accomplish that\n\n43:34.620 --> 43:38.300\n because the Earth's gravity field changes\n\n43:38.300 --> 43:40.260\n as you go around in orbit and pulls you\n\n43:40.260 --> 43:42.580\n out of your little box.\n\n43:42.580 --> 43:47.580\n There are other perturbations that can throw you off a bit.\n\n43:47.940 --> 43:50.740\n And then most people want to do things\n\n43:50.740 --> 43:53.460\n a little bit more interesting like maneuver\n\n43:53.460 --> 43:55.940\n to avoid being hit by space debris\n\n43:55.940 --> 44:00.280\n or perhaps lower their orbit to take a higher resolution\n\n44:00.280 --> 44:02.980\n image of something and then return.\n\n44:02.980 --> 44:06.500\n At the end of your mission, you're supposed\n\n44:06.500 --> 44:09.460\n to responsibly get rid of your satellite,\n\n44:09.460 --> 44:13.560\n whether that's burning it up, but if you're in geo,\n\n44:13.560 --> 44:15.980\n you want to push it higher into graveyard orbit.\n\n44:17.380 --> 44:19.340\n What's geo and what's graveyard?\n\n44:19.340 --> 44:21.920\n So low Earth orbit and then geosynchronous orbit\n\n44:21.920 --> 44:23.220\n or geostationary orbit.\n\n44:23.220 --> 44:24.740\n And there's a graveyard?\n\n44:24.740 --> 44:29.380\n Yeah, so those satellites are at like 40,000 kilometers.\n\n44:29.380 --> 44:33.100\n So if they were to try to push their satellites\n\n44:33.100 --> 44:35.460\n back down to burn up in the atmosphere,\n\n44:35.460 --> 44:37.840\n they would need even more propulsion\n\n44:37.840 --> 44:40.580\n than they've had for the whole lifetime of their mission.\n\n44:40.580 --> 44:42.420\n So instead they push them higher\n\n44:42.420 --> 44:44.220\n where it'll take a million years\n\n44:44.220 --> 44:46.820\n for it to naturally deorbit.\n\n44:46.820 --> 44:50.220\n So we're also cluttering that higher bit up as well,\n\n44:50.220 --> 44:54.180\n but it's not as pressing as Leo, which is low Earth orbit\n\n44:54.180 --> 44:56.340\n where more of these commercial missions are going now.\n\n44:56.340 --> 44:59.300\n Well, so how hard is the collision avoidance problem there?\n\n44:59.300 --> 45:00.840\n You said some debris and stuff.\n\n45:00.840 --> 45:03.780\n So like how much propulsion is needed?\n\n45:03.780 --> 45:05.860\n Like how much is the life of a satellite\n\n45:05.860 --> 45:08.380\n is just like a crap trying to avoid\n\n45:08.380 --> 45:09.580\n like little things down there?\n\n45:09.580 --> 45:14.580\n I think one of the recent rules of thumb I heard\n\n45:14.620 --> 45:17.520\n was per year some of these small satellites\n\n45:17.520 --> 45:20.840\n are doing like three collision avoidance maneuvers.\n\n45:21.860 --> 45:25.320\n So that's not, yeah, but it's not zero.\n\n45:25.320 --> 45:30.320\n And it takes a lot of planning and people on the ground\n\n45:30.860 --> 45:34.700\n and none of that really, I don't think right now\n\n45:34.700 --> 45:36.260\n is autonomous.\n\n45:36.260 --> 45:37.620\n Oh, that's not good.\n\n45:37.620 --> 45:39.900\n Yeah, and then we have a lot of folks\n\n45:39.900 --> 45:42.980\n taking advantage of Moore's law and cheaper spacecraft.\n\n45:42.980 --> 45:44.020\n So they're launching them up\n\n45:44.020 --> 45:46.060\n without the ability to maneuver themselves.\n\n45:46.060 --> 45:49.140\n And they're like, well, I don't know, just don't hit me.\n\n45:49.140 --> 45:51.580\n And three times a year that could become affordable\n\n45:51.580 --> 45:56.380\n if it gets hit, maybe it won't be damaged kind of thing,\n\n45:56.380 --> 45:57.660\n that kind of logic.\n\n45:57.660 --> 46:00.940\n Affordable in that instead of launching one satellite,\n\n46:00.940 --> 46:02.740\n they'll launch 20 small ones.\n\n46:02.740 --> 46:05.100\n Yeah, so if one gets taken out, that's okay.\n\n46:05.100 --> 46:08.100\n But the problem is that one good sized satellite\n\n46:08.100 --> 46:11.740\n getting hit, that's like a ballistic event\n\n46:11.740 --> 46:14.080\n that turns into 10,000 pieces of debris\n\n46:14.080 --> 46:17.460\n that then are the things that go and hit the other satellites.\n\n46:17.460 --> 46:18.300\n Yeah.\n\n46:18.300 --> 46:22.380\n So do you see a world where, like in your sense,\n\n46:22.380 --> 46:25.780\n in your own work and just in the space industry in general,\n\n46:25.780 --> 46:28.220\n do you see the people moving towards bigger satellites\n\n46:28.220 --> 46:29.820\n or smaller satellites?\n\n46:29.820 --> 46:31.260\n Is there going to be a mix?\n\n46:31.260 --> 46:32.860\n Like what's, and what do we talk,\n\n46:32.860 --> 46:36.300\n what does it mean for a satellite to be big and small?\n\n46:36.300 --> 46:37.140\n What size are we talking about?\n\n46:37.140 --> 46:42.140\n So big, the space industry prior to,\n\n46:42.140 --> 46:45.660\n I don't know, 1990, I guess the bulk of,\n\n46:45.660 --> 46:49.020\n the majority of satellites were the size of a school bus\n\n46:49.020 --> 46:53.220\n and cost a couple billion dollars.\n\n46:53.220 --> 46:58.220\n And now our first launches were on satellites\n\n47:00.020 --> 47:01.860\n the size of shoe boxes that were built\n\n47:01.860 --> 47:03.060\n by high school students.\n\n47:03.060 --> 47:05.380\n So that's a very different,\n\n47:05.380 --> 47:07.500\n to give you the two ends of the spectrum.\n\n47:07.500 --> 47:12.320\n So big satellites will, I think they're here to stay,\n\n47:12.320 --> 47:15.640\n at least as far as I can see into the future\n\n47:15.640 --> 47:18.700\n for things like broadcasting.\n\n47:18.700 --> 47:21.720\n You want to be able to broadcast\n\n47:21.720 --> 47:24.020\n to as many people as possible.\n\n47:25.920 --> 47:28.840\n You also can't just go to small satellites\n\n47:28.840 --> 47:32.040\n and say Moore's law for things like optics.\n\n47:32.040 --> 47:34.680\n So if you have an aperture on your satellite,\n\n47:34.680 --> 47:36.640\n that just, that doesn't follow Moore's law.\n\n47:36.640 --> 47:37.800\n That's different.\n\n47:37.800 --> 47:40.560\n So it's always going to be the size that it will be,\n\n47:40.560 --> 47:43.120\n unless there's some new physics that comes out\n\n47:43.120 --> 47:44.320\n that I'm not aware of.\n\n47:44.320 --> 47:46.640\n But if you need a resolution and you're at an altitude,\n\n47:46.640 --> 47:49.200\n that kind of sets your, the size of your telescope.\n\n47:50.320 --> 47:52.800\n But because of Moore's law,\n\n47:52.800 --> 47:56.840\n we are able to do a lot more with smaller packages.\n\n47:56.840 --> 48:00.320\n And with that comes more affordability\n\n48:00.320 --> 48:03.800\n and opening up access to space to more and more people.\n\n48:03.800 --> 48:06.280\n Well, what's the smallest satellite you've seen go up there?\n\n48:06.280 --> 48:09.360\n Like what are the smallest kind of, you said shoe boxes.\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:14.360\n Yeah, so I think the smallest common form factor\n\n48:14.800 --> 48:17.680\n can fit a softball inside.\n\n48:17.680 --> 48:21.360\n So that's 10 centimeters on each side.\n\n48:21.360 --> 48:24.440\n But then there are some companies working on\n\n48:24.440 --> 48:26.360\n fractions of that even.\n\n48:26.360 --> 48:30.480\n And they're doing things like IOT type application.\n\n48:30.480 --> 48:34.520\n So it's very low bandwidth type things,\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:37.320\n but they're finding some niches for those.\n\n48:37.320 --> 48:38.520\n Do you mean like there's a business,\n\n48:38.520 --> 48:40.440\n there's a thing to do with them?\n\n48:40.440 --> 48:41.280\n Yes, either.\n\n48:41.280 --> 48:44.040\n What do you do with a small satellite like that?\n\n48:44.040 --> 48:48.360\n You can track a ship going across the ocean.\n\n48:48.360 --> 48:51.120\n Like if you need to, if you're just pinging something,\n\n48:51.120 --> 48:53.800\n you can handle that amount of data\n\n48:53.800 --> 48:56.160\n and those latencies and so on.\n\n48:56.160 --> 48:57.400\n You have to have propulsion on that.\n\n48:57.400 --> 48:58.760\n You have to have a little engine.\n\n48:58.760 --> 49:02.720\n No, those are just letting fall out of the sky.\n\n49:02.720 --> 49:06.440\n Okay, so what kind of satellite\n\n49:06.440 --> 49:08.920\n would you equip a colloid engine on?\n\n49:08.920 --> 49:13.080\n Anything that's bigger than probably about 20 kilograms,\n\n49:13.080 --> 49:16.400\n anything that needs to stay up for more than a year\n\n49:16.400 --> 49:20.280\n or anything somebody spent more than like 100K to build\n\n49:20.280 --> 49:21.920\n are kind of the ways I would think about it.\n\n49:21.920 --> 49:23.560\n That's a lot of use cases.\n\n49:23.560 --> 49:26.080\n What's a small sat?\n\n49:26.080 --> 49:26.920\n Like what category?\n\n49:26.920 --> 49:28.560\n Small sat is actually very big.\n\n49:28.560 --> 49:31.360\n I think it's like 700 kilograms,\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:33.840\n or I keep hitting my microphone,\n\n49:33.840 --> 49:38.840\n maybe 1,000 kilograms down to 200 kilograms.\n\n49:40.080 --> 49:42.360\n People have their own kind of definitions\n\n49:42.360 --> 49:43.320\n of how they break them up,\n\n49:43.320 --> 49:46.000\n but small sat is still quite large.\n\n49:46.000 --> 49:49.880\n And then it's kind of also applied as a blanket term\n\n49:49.880 --> 49:52.920\n for anything that's not a school bus size satellite.\n\n49:52.920 --> 49:56.360\n So we need to get our jargon straight in the industry.\n\n49:56.360 --> 50:00.040\n So do you see a possible future where,\n\n50:00.040 --> 50:02.520\n you know, there's a few thousand satellites up there now,\n\n50:02.520 --> 50:04.520\n a couple of thousand of them functioning.\n\n50:05.440 --> 50:07.520\n Do you see a future where there's like millions\n\n50:07.520 --> 50:09.960\n of satellites up in orbit?\n\n50:09.960 --> 50:13.000\n Or forget millions, tens of thousands,\n\n50:13.000 --> 50:16.200\n which just seems like where the natural trajectory\n\n50:16.200 --> 50:20.160\n of the way things are going now is going.\n\n50:20.160 --> 50:22.480\n Tens of thousands, yes.\n\n50:22.480 --> 50:26.360\n The two buckets of applications,\n\n50:26.360 --> 50:30.480\n one is imaging and the other is communication.\n\n50:30.480 --> 50:35.160\n So imaging, I think that will plateau\n\n50:35.160 --> 50:39.120\n because one satellite or one constellation\n\n50:39.120 --> 50:40.680\n can take an image or a video\n\n50:40.680 --> 50:44.320\n and sell it to, you know, infinity customers.\n\n50:44.320 --> 50:47.560\n But if you're providing communications\n\n50:47.560 --> 50:51.640\n like broadband internet or satellite cell\n\n50:51.640 --> 50:54.120\n or something like that, satellite phone,\n\n50:54.120 --> 50:58.680\n you know, you're limited by your transponders and so on.\n\n50:58.680 --> 51:02.040\n So to serve more people, you actually need more satellites\n\n51:02.040 --> 51:06.440\n and perhaps at the rate, you know, our data consumption\n\n51:06.440 --> 51:08.840\n and things are going these days.\n\n51:08.840 --> 51:11.200\n Yeah, I can see tens of thousands of satellites.\n\n51:12.720 --> 51:14.480\n Can I ask you a ridiculous question?\n\n51:14.480 --> 51:15.360\n Yes.\n\n51:15.360 --> 51:18.720\n So I've recently watched this documentary on Netflix\n\n51:18.720 --> 51:23.240\n about flat earthers, you know,\n\n51:23.240 --> 51:25.920\n the people that believe in a flat earth.\n\n51:25.920 --> 51:30.040\n As somebody who develops propulsion systems\n\n51:30.040 --> 51:33.080\n for satellites and for spacecraft,\n\n51:33.960 --> 51:37.600\n what's, do you use the most convincing evidence\n\n51:37.600 --> 51:38.840\n that the earth is round?\n\n51:40.760 --> 51:45.760\n Probably some of the photos taken from the moon.\n\n51:48.800 --> 51:49.760\n Photos from the moon?\n\n51:49.760 --> 51:52.960\n Okay, so it's not from the satellite space.\n\n51:52.960 --> 51:56.080\n Yeah, I think seeing that perspective,\n\n51:57.560 --> 52:00.400\n maybe I'm just, I'm answering too personally\n\n52:00.400 --> 52:03.000\n because I really love those photos.\n\n52:03.000 --> 52:04.000\n Because they're beautiful, yeah.\n\n52:04.000 --> 52:06.400\n I really like the ones that show the moon\n\n52:06.400 --> 52:09.920\n and the lunar lander and they're taken\n\n52:09.920 --> 52:10.840\n a little bit farther back.\n\n52:10.840 --> 52:14.280\n So you see earth and first you're like, wow, that's tiny\n\n52:14.280 --> 52:17.800\n and we're insignificant and that's kind of sad.\n\n52:17.800 --> 52:19.720\n But then you see this really cool thing\n\n52:19.720 --> 52:23.760\n that we landed on another planetary body\n\n52:23.760 --> 52:24.840\n and you're like, oh, okay.\n\n52:24.840 --> 52:26.760\n Can you actually see earth?\n\n52:26.760 --> 52:27.600\n I don't know if I remember this.\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:29.160\n Yeah, I'll send you that picture.\n\n52:29.160 --> 52:31.520\n Because I love the pictures or videos\n\n52:31.520 --> 52:34.040\n of just earth from orbit and so on.\n\n52:34.040 --> 52:34.880\n Right, yeah.\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:36.240\n Just like those, that's really beautiful.\n\n52:36.240 --> 52:38.080\n That's like a perspective shifter.\n\n52:38.080 --> 52:39.760\n That's the pale blue dot, right?\n\n52:39.760 --> 52:41.400\n It probably appears tiny.\n\n52:41.400 --> 52:46.280\n Yeah, and just that juxtaposition of the insignificance,\n\n52:46.280 --> 52:49.240\n but we built this, really cool thing.\n\n52:49.240 --> 52:50.720\n And I just love that, yeah.\n\n52:50.720 --> 52:51.560\n Oh, that'd be cool.\n\n52:51.560 --> 52:53.080\n I can't, I personally love the idea\n\n52:53.080 --> 52:54.480\n of humans stepping on Mars.\n\n52:54.480 --> 52:57.840\n I'm such a sucker for the romantic notion of that\n\n52:57.840 --> 53:01.680\n and being able to take pictures from Mars next.\n\n53:01.680 --> 53:03.160\n So you would go?\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:08.080\n I, yeah, I would be, what did you say?\n\n53:08.080 --> 53:09.120\n You said you wouldn't be the first one.\n\n53:09.120 --> 53:10.600\n Not in the first 1,000.\n\n53:10.600 --> 53:14.400\n 1,000, which it's funny because to me,\n\n53:14.400 --> 53:17.200\n that's brave to be in the first million.\n\n53:17.200 --> 53:21.160\n I think when the Declaration of Independence\n\n53:21.160 --> 53:22.680\n was signed in the United States,\n\n53:22.680 --> 53:25.640\n that was like two million people.\n\n53:25.640 --> 53:27.320\n So I would like to show up\n\n53:27.320 --> 53:29.200\n when they're signing those documents.\n\n53:29.200 --> 53:30.040\n Okay.\n\n53:30.040 --> 53:31.080\n So maybe the two million.\n\n53:31.080 --> 53:32.880\n Oh, that's an interesting way to think about it.\n\n53:32.880 --> 53:35.160\n Because like then we're like participating\n\n53:35.160 --> 53:38.040\n in citizenry and defining the direction.\n\n53:38.040 --> 53:41.160\n So it's not the technical risk.\n\n53:41.160 --> 53:43.440\n You just don't wanna show up somewhere\n\n53:43.440 --> 53:46.120\n that's like America before.\n\n53:46.120 --> 53:51.120\n Yeah, because I, from a psychological perspective,\n\n53:51.560 --> 53:54.120\n it's just gonna be a stressful mess\n\n53:54.120 --> 53:56.240\n as people have studied, right?\n\n53:56.240 --> 54:01.240\n It's like, it's people, most likely the process\n\n54:02.080 --> 54:07.080\n of colonization like looks like basically a prison.\n\n54:07.320 --> 54:10.520\n Like you're in a very tight and closed space with people.\n\n54:10.520 --> 54:13.440\n And it's just a really stressful environment.\n\n54:13.440 --> 54:15.400\n How do you select the kind of people that will go\n\n54:15.400 --> 54:16.480\n and then there'll be drama.\n\n54:16.480 --> 54:17.520\n There's always drama.\n\n54:17.520 --> 54:21.360\n And I just wanna show up when there's some rules.\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:22.960\n But I mean, you know, it depends.\n\n54:22.960 --> 54:24.360\n So I'm not worried about the health\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:26.120\n and the technical difficulties.\n\n54:26.120 --> 54:29.520\n I'm more worried about the psychological difficulties.\n\n54:29.520 --> 54:31.320\n And also just not being able to tweet.\n\n54:31.320 --> 54:33.640\n Like what are you gonna, how are you talking?\n\n54:33.640 --> 54:34.640\n There's no Netflix.\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:37.360\n So yeah, maybe not in the first million,\n\n54:37.360 --> 54:39.880\n but the first 100,000.\n\n54:39.880 --> 54:42.680\n It's exciting to define the direction of a new,\n\n54:42.680 --> 54:46.240\n like how often do we not just have a revolution\n\n54:46.240 --> 54:48.200\n to redefine our government,\n\n54:48.200 --> 54:51.240\n as smaller countries are still doing to this day,\n\n54:51.240 --> 54:54.200\n but literally start over from scratch.\n\n54:54.200 --> 54:56.840\n There's just our financial system.\n\n54:56.840 --> 54:59.640\n It could be like based on cryptocurrency,\n\n54:59.640 --> 55:02.560\n you could think about like how democracy,\n\n55:02.560 --> 55:06.880\n we have now the technology that can enable pure democracy,\n\n55:06.880 --> 55:09.720\n for example, if we choose to do that,\n\n55:09.720 --> 55:11.520\n as opposed to representative democracy,\n\n55:11.520 --> 55:12.800\n all those kinds of things.\n\n55:12.800 --> 55:16.560\n So we talked about two different forms of propulsion,\n\n55:16.560 --> 55:18.000\n which are super exciting.\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:20.720\n So the chemical based, that's doing pretty well.\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:23.000\n And then the electric based is,\n\n55:24.440 --> 55:26.880\n are there types of propulsion\n\n55:26.880 --> 55:29.200\n that might sound like science fiction right now,\n\n55:29.200 --> 55:31.280\n but are actually within the reach of science\n\n55:31.280 --> 55:34.240\n in the next 10, 20, 30, 50 years\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:35.960\n that you kind of think about,\n\n55:35.960 --> 55:39.280\n or maybe even within the space of even just like,\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:42.400\n like even ION engines,\n\n55:42.400 --> 55:45.600\n is there like breakthroughs that might 10 X the thing,\n\n55:45.600 --> 55:47.760\n like really improve it?\n\n55:47.760 --> 55:50.520\n So, you know, the real game changer\n\n55:50.520 --> 55:54.160\n would be propellantless propulsion.\n\n55:54.160 --> 55:57.600\n And so every couple of years you see a new,\n\n55:57.600 --> 56:02.600\n now a startup or a researcher comes up with some contraption\n\n56:03.080 --> 56:06.080\n for producing thrust that didn't require,\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:08.280\n you know, we've been talking about conservation of momentum,\n\n56:08.280 --> 56:11.680\n mass times velocity out the back,\n\n56:11.680 --> 56:13.520\n mass times velocity forward.\n\n56:13.520 --> 56:14.840\n Yes, exactly.\n\n56:14.840 --> 56:18.600\n And you have to, you know, carry that up with you\n\n56:18.600 --> 56:21.840\n or find it on an asteroid or harvest it from somewhere\n\n56:21.840 --> 56:22.960\n if you didn't bring it with you.\n\n56:22.960 --> 56:25.960\n So not having to do that would be, you know,\n\n56:25.960 --> 56:28.720\n one of the ultimate game changers.\n\n56:28.720 --> 56:33.720\n And I, you know, unless there are new types of physics,\n\n56:35.360 --> 56:36.800\n I don't know how we do it,\n\n56:36.800 --> 56:39.800\n but it comes up often, so it's something I do think about.\n\n56:39.800 --> 56:41.680\n And, you know, the one,\n\n56:41.680 --> 56:44.360\n I think it's called the Casimir effect.\n\n56:44.360 --> 56:46.640\n If you can, if you have two plates\n\n56:46.640 --> 56:49.920\n and the space between them is on the order of these,\n\n56:49.920 --> 56:53.520\n like the wavelength of these ephemeral vacuum particles\n\n56:53.520 --> 56:56.040\n that pop into and out of existence or something.\n\n56:57.760 --> 57:01.440\n I may be confusing multiple types of propellantless forces,\n\n57:01.440 --> 57:06.440\n but that could be real\n\n57:06.920 --> 57:10.640\n and could be something that we use eventually.\n\n57:10.640 --> 57:12.280\n What would be the power source?\n\n57:12.280 --> 57:15.120\n Yeah, the most recent engine like this\n\n57:15.120 --> 57:19.640\n that was just debunked this year, I think,\n\n57:19.640 --> 57:22.400\n in March or something was called the M drive.\n\n57:22.400 --> 57:26.080\n And supposedly you used a power source,\n\n57:26.080 --> 57:27.960\n so, you know, batteries or solar panels\n\n57:27.960 --> 57:32.640\n to generate microwaves into this resonant cavity.\n\n57:32.640 --> 57:35.480\n And people claimed it produced thrust.\n\n57:35.480 --> 57:38.640\n So they went straight from this really loose concept\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:40.160\n to building a device and testing it.\n\n57:40.160 --> 57:42.200\n And they said, we've measured thrust\n\n57:42.200 --> 57:44.520\n and sure on their thrust balance, they saw thrust\n\n57:44.520 --> 57:47.960\n and different researchers built it and tested it\n\n57:47.960 --> 57:49.240\n and got the same measurements.\n\n57:49.240 --> 57:52.080\n And so it was looking actually pretty good.\n\n57:52.080 --> 57:53.440\n No one could explain how it worked,\n\n57:53.440 --> 57:58.440\n but what they said was that this inside the cavity,\n\n57:59.160 --> 58:01.320\n the microwaves themselves didn't change,\n\n58:01.320 --> 58:03.960\n but the speed of light changed inside the cavity.\n\n58:03.960 --> 58:06.520\n So relative to that, you know,\n\n58:06.520 --> 58:08.880\n their momentum was conserved.\n\n58:09.880 --> 58:14.640\n And I don't, you know, whatever.\n\n58:14.640 --> 58:17.800\n But finally someone, I think at NASA built the device,\n\n58:17.800 --> 58:20.560\n tested it, got the same thrust, then unhooked it,\n\n58:20.560 --> 58:22.240\n flipped it backwards and turned it on,\n\n58:22.240 --> 58:24.760\n but got the same thrust in the same direction again.\n\n58:24.760 --> 58:26.800\n And so they're like, this is just an interaction\n\n58:26.800 --> 58:28.520\n with the test setup or, you know,\n\n58:28.520 --> 58:30.640\n some of the chamber or something like that.\n\n58:30.640 --> 58:34.640\n So forwarded again, but, you know,\n\n58:34.640 --> 58:36.640\n it would be so wonderful for everybody\n\n58:36.640 --> 58:39.560\n if we could figure out how to do it, but I don't know.\n\n58:39.560 --> 58:41.480\n That's an interesting twist on it\n\n58:41.480 --> 58:44.920\n because that's more about efficient travel,\n\n58:44.920 --> 58:46.160\n long distance travel, right?\n\n58:46.160 --> 58:47.960\n That's not necessarily about speed.\n\n58:49.040 --> 58:51.160\n That's more about enabling like,\n\n58:51.160 --> 58:55.400\n let's hook that up to the nuclear power supply.\n\n58:55.400 --> 58:56.240\n There you go.\n\n58:56.240 --> 58:57.560\n Okay.\n\n58:57.560 --> 59:01.360\n But still in terms of speed, in terms of trying to,\n\n59:01.360 --> 59:06.000\n so there's recently, already I think been debunked\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:09.680\n or close to being debunked, but the signal,\n\n59:09.680 --> 59:13.680\n a weird signal from our nearby friends,\n\n59:13.680 --> 59:16.560\n nearby exoplanets from Proxima Centauri,\n\n59:16.560 --> 59:21.560\n a signal that's 4.2 light years away.\n\n59:22.440 --> 59:27.440\n So, you know, the thought is it'd be kind of cool\n\n59:28.120 --> 59:30.320\n if there's life out there, alien life,\n\n59:31.440 --> 59:34.360\n but it'd be really cool if it could fly out there and check.\n\n59:34.360 --> 59:37.000\n And so what kind of propulsion,\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.360\n and do you think about what kind of propulsion\n\n59:39.360 --> 59:42.120\n will allow us to travel close to the speed of light\n\n59:42.120 --> 59:43.680\n or, you know, half the speed of light,\n\n59:43.680 --> 59:45.520\n all those kinds of things that would allow us\n\n59:45.520 --> 59:48.360\n to get to Proxima Centauri and have reasonable,\n\n59:48.360 --> 59:49.360\n in a lifetime?\n\n59:50.560 --> 59:54.800\n You know, there's the project Breakthrough Starshot.\n\n59:54.800 --> 59:55.640\n Yeah.\n\n59:55.640 --> 59:59.640\n That's looking at sending those tiny little chip sets.\n\n59:59.640 --> 1:00:01.840\n They're like accelerating really fast.\n\n1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:04.160\n Yeah, using a laser, so launching them\n\n1:00:04.160 --> 1:00:06.800\n and then while they're still relatively close to the earth,\n\n1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:09.160\n you know, blasting them with some,\n\n1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:12.800\n I forget what, even what power level you needed\n\n1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:15.720\n to accelerate them fast enough to get there in 20 years.\n\n1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:16.760\n Super crazy sounding,\n\n1:00:16.760 --> 1:00:19.440\n but a lot of people say that's a legitimate,\n\n1:00:19.440 --> 1:00:22.320\n like it's crazy sounding, but it can actually pull it off.\n\n1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:24.160\n Yeah, I love that project\n\n1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:26.080\n because there are a lot of different aspects.\n\n1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:27.360\n You know, there's the laser,\n\n1:00:27.360 --> 1:00:31.280\n there's how do you then get enough power\n\n1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.200\n when you're there to send a signal back.\n\n1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:35.640\n No part of that project is possible right now,\n\n1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:38.320\n but I think it's really exciting.\n\n1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:42.880\n But do you see like human, like a spacecraft\n\n1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:45.520\n with a human on it, so it's like a heavy one,\n\n1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:49.120\n being like us inventing new propulsion systems entirely.\n\n1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:52.400\n Like, do you ever see that on the radar\n\n1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:54.000\n of propulsion systems like that\n\n1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.280\n or are they completely out there in the impossible?\n\n1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.720\n Well, we're going to quickly leave the realm\n\n1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:03.200\n of what I can describe with any credibility,\n\n1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:08.080\n but I think because of special relativity,\n\n1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:10.640\n if we try to accelerate some mass\n\n1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:15.280\n close to the speed of light, it becomes infinitely heavy\n\n1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:17.080\n and then we just don't,\n\n1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:20.400\n we'd have to like harness a lot of suns to do that.\n\n1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:25.080\n Or, you know, it's just that math doesn't quite work out,\n\n1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:30.080\n but, you know, in my child's, my childlike heart,\n\n1:01:30.600 --> 1:01:33.840\n I believe that, you know, we're missing something,\n\n1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:38.320\n whether it's, you know, dark matter or other dimensions.\n\n1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.920\n And if you can just have some anti matter\n\n1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:46.640\n and a black hole and then ride that around\n\n1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:49.520\n and somehow, you know, turn that into some.\n\n1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.240\n Mess with gravity somehow.\n\n1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:55.520\n Yeah, I feel like we're missing lots of things\n\n1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:00.080\n in this puzzle and that, you know.\n\n1:02:00.080 --> 1:02:01.280\n I want to heart that puzzle.\n\n1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:02.120\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:06.240\n I can speak with confidence as a descendant of apes\n\n1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:08.520\n that we don't know what the hell we're doing.\n\n1:02:08.520 --> 1:02:09.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:12.760\n So there's, we're like really confident,\n\n1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:14.760\n like physicists are really confident\n\n1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:17.480\n that we've like got most of the picture down,\n\n1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:20.880\n but it feels like, oh boy,\n\n1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.400\n it feels like that we might not even be getting started\n\n1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:26.920\n on some of the essential things\n\n1:02:26.920 --> 1:02:31.320\n that would allow us to engineer systems\n\n1:02:31.320 --> 1:02:36.320\n that would allow us to travel to space much, much faster.\n\n1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:38.200\n Yeah, and there's even things\n\n1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:42.440\n that are much more commonplace that we can't explain,\n\n1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:44.080\n but we've started to take for granted,\n\n1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:48.360\n like quantum tunneling, you know,\n\n1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:50.680\n just things like, oh, the electron was here\n\n1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:53.160\n with this energy and now it's here with this energy\n\n1:02:53.160 --> 1:02:55.600\n and it's just tunneling.\n\n1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:58.080\n But so, you know, we're missing a lot of the picture.\n\n1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:02.120\n So yeah, I don't know, to, you know,\n\n1:03:02.120 --> 1:03:03.440\n use your same question from earlier,\n\n1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:05.480\n I don't know if you and I will see it,\n\n1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.920\n but yeah, someday.\n\n1:03:07.920 --> 1:03:09.640\n You're the cofounder of,\n\n1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:12.440\n just like we've been talking about, Axion Systems.\n\n1:03:12.440 --> 1:03:15.920\n It's a, would you say a space propulsion company?\n\n1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:16.760\n Yes.\n\n1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:17.600\n Broadly speaking.\n\n1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:22.240\n So how do you, big question,\n\n1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:25.640\n how do you build a rocket company\n\n1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:30.640\n from like a propulsion company from one person,\n\n1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:35.240\n from two people to 10 people plus,\n\n1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:40.240\n and actually, you know, take it to a successful product?\n\n1:03:41.280 --> 1:03:44.480\n Yeah, well, I think the early stage is quite,\n\n1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:48.440\n I'm not supposed to use the word easy\n\n1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:49.760\n when you work in rocket science,\n\n1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:53.160\n but straightforward when you're working on something,\n\n1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:55.680\n you know, sexy, like an ion engine,\n\n1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:58.680\n it's more straightforward to raise money\n\n1:03:58.680 --> 1:04:00.800\n and get people to come work for you\n\n1:04:00.800 --> 1:04:02.280\n because the vision's really exciting.\n\n1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:04.640\n And actually that's something I would say\n\n1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:06.120\n is very important throughout,\n\n1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:10.040\n is a really exciting vision\n\n1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:13.280\n because when everything, you know, goes to crap,\n\n1:04:13.280 --> 1:04:15.360\n you need that to get people\n\n1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.160\n getting themselves out of bed in the morning\n\n1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:20.480\n and thinking of the higher purpose there.\n\n1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:24.160\n And, you know, another thing along the way\n\n1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:27.440\n that I think is key in building any company\n\n1:04:27.440 --> 1:04:31.120\n is the right early employees\n\n1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:33.800\n that also have their own networks\n\n1:04:33.800 --> 1:04:36.960\n and can bring in a lot of people\n\n1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:41.960\n that, you know, really make the whole greater\n\n1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:46.640\n than just the sum of the early team.\n\n1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:47.640\n How do you build that?\n\n1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:49.360\n Like, how do you find people?\n\n1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:52.400\n It's like asking, like, how do you make friends?\n\n1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:55.920\n But is there, is it luck?\n\n1:04:55.920 --> 1:04:57.840\n Is there a system?\n\n1:04:57.840 --> 1:05:00.840\n Like how, in terms of the people you've connected with,\n\n1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:05.440\n the people you built the company with,\n\n1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:10.360\n is there some thread, some commonality,\n\n1:05:10.360 --> 1:05:13.160\n some pattern that you find to be,\n\n1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:15.720\n to hold for what makes a great team?\n\n1:05:15.720 --> 1:05:18.320\n I think, you know, personally,\n\n1:05:18.320 --> 1:05:21.840\n a thread for me has been my network\n\n1:05:21.840 --> 1:05:25.840\n and being able to draw on that a lot,\n\n1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:29.960\n but also giving back to it as much as possible\n\n1:05:29.960 --> 1:05:32.040\n in like an unsolicited sort of way,\n\n1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.840\n like making connections between people\n\n1:05:34.840 --> 1:05:36.800\n that, you know, maybe didn't ask,\n\n1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:39.520\n but that I think could be really fruitful.\n\n1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:42.960\n And even, you know, weirder than that\n\n1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:46.920\n is just really getting, you know,\n\n1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:49.520\n having weird, uncomfortable conversations\n\n1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:51.160\n with people like at a conference\n\n1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:55.360\n and getting over the small talk quickly\n\n1:05:55.360 --> 1:05:56.800\n and getting to know them quickly\n\n1:05:56.800 --> 1:05:59.240\n and having a relationship that stands out\n\n1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:03.040\n and then being able to call on them later because of that.\n\n1:06:03.040 --> 1:06:07.120\n And I think that's been because I'm introverted\n\n1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:09.920\n and I, you know, want to poke my eyes out\n\n1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:13.840\n instead of go and do small talk.\n\n1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:16.720\n And so I huddle in a corner with one person\n\n1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:19.600\n and, you know, we talk about aliens or things like that.\n\n1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:23.000\n And so, you know, that's all to say that,\n\n1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.440\n you know, having a strong network,\n\n1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:28.200\n I think is really important, but a genuine one.\n\n1:06:28.200 --> 1:06:31.960\n And let's see, other ways to build a rocket company,\n\n1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:33.560\n kind of making sure you're paying attention\n\n1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:35.800\n to the sweeping trends of the industry\n\n1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:37.880\n so everybody just cares about cost\n\n1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:41.480\n and being able to get out ahead of that\n\n1:06:41.480 --> 1:06:44.120\n and even more than we ever thought we'd need to\n\n1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:46.920\n as far as what we needed to price our systems at.\n\n1:06:46.920 --> 1:06:50.200\n You know, people for,\n\n1:06:50.200 --> 1:06:53.000\n since the start of the US space industry,\n\n1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:57.080\n they've been paying 20, 25 million in adjusted dollars\n\n1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:58.160\n for an ion engine.\n\n1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:03.160\n And seeing that now people are going to want to pay 10K\n\n1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:08.160\n for an ion engine and just staying out ahead of that\n\n1:07:08.920 --> 1:07:10.600\n and those kinds of things.\n\n1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:12.400\n So, you know, being out in the industry\n\n1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:15.040\n and talking to as many people as possible.\n\n1:07:15.040 --> 1:07:15.960\n So there's a drive.\n\n1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:18.440\n I mean, I suppose SpaceX really pushed that.\n\n1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:20.240\n Frustrating for me.\n\n1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:22.600\n So SpaceX really pushed this,\n\n1:07:24.880 --> 1:07:26.960\n the application of, I guess, capitalism\n\n1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:28.440\n of driving the price down,\n\n1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:31.800\n of basically forcing people to ask the question,\n\n1:07:31.800 --> 1:07:34.600\n can this be done cheaper?\n\n1:07:35.760 --> 1:07:40.760\n This can lead to like big problems, I would say,\n\n1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:43.080\n in the following sense.\n\n1:07:43.080 --> 1:07:46.200\n I see this in the car industry, for example,\n\n1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:49.480\n that people have,\n\n1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:53.840\n it's such a small margin for profit.\n\n1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:57.120\n Like they've driven the cost of everything down so much\n\n1:07:57.120 --> 1:07:59.880\n that there's literally no room for innovation\n\n1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:01.240\n for taking risks.\n\n1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:04.520\n So like cars, which is funny\n\n1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:07.560\n because not until Tesla, really,\n\n1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.520\n which is one of the, in a long, long time,\n\n1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:14.400\n one of the first successful new car companies\n\n1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:16.240\n that's constantly innovating,\n\n1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:19.200\n every other car company is really pouring\n\n1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:21.600\n in terms of their technological innovation.\n\n1:08:21.600 --> 1:08:24.360\n They innovate on design and style and so on,\n\n1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:27.360\n that people fall in love with the look and so on,\n\n1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.800\n but it's not really innovation.\n\n1:08:29.800 --> 1:08:31.280\n In terms of the technology in it,\n\n1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:33.360\n it's really boringly the same thing,\n\n1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:35.840\n and they're really afraid of taking risks.\n\n1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:38.520\n And that's a big problem for rocket space, too,\n\n1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:41.240\n is like if you're cutting out costs,\n\n1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:44.120\n you can't afford to innovate, to try out new things,\n\n1:08:44.120 --> 1:08:48.480\n and that's definitely true with ion engines, right?\n\n1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:54.680\n So how do you compete in this space?\n\n1:08:54.680 --> 1:08:57.440\n Do you, by the way, see SpaceX as a competitor?\n\n1:08:57.440 --> 1:08:59.840\n And what do you say in general\n\n1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:01.440\n about the competition in this space?\n\n1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:05.920\n Is it really difficult as a business to compete here?\n\n1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:09.080\n No, I don't see SpaceX as a competitor,\n\n1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:12.960\n and I see them as one day, not too long from now,\n\n1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:14.640\n a customer, hopefully.\n\n1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:18.680\n I mean, to compete against that,\n\n1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:23.080\n I think you just have to do things in an unconventional way.\n\n1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:27.000\n So bringing silicon MEMS manufacturing\n\n1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.600\n to propulsion, NASA doesn't make ion engines\n\n1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:34.880\n using a batch mass producible technique.\n\n1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:38.320\n They have one guy that's been making their ion engines\n\n1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:41.760\n for 20 years bespoke pieces of jewelry.\n\n1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:46.760\n So bringing things to what you're trying to innovate\n\n1:09:47.680 --> 1:09:51.080\n to make them, in our case, more cost effective\n\n1:09:51.080 --> 1:09:52.480\n was really key.\n\n1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:56.360\n I like the idea of somebody putting out ion engines\n\n1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:57.520\n on like Etsy.\n\n1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:00.880\n Yeah, my advisor at MIT would,\n\n1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:02.320\n the thruster chip I was holding up,\n\n1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:05.680\n he would wear one as a lapel pin.\n\n1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:08.520\n But in general, just on the topic of SpaceX,\n\n1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:12.520\n 2020 has seen some difficult things\n\n1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.800\n for human civilization.\n\n1:10:14.800 --> 1:10:17.800\n And it's been a lot of, first of all, it's an election year,\n\n1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:20.520\n there's been a lot of drama and division about that.\n\n1:10:20.520 --> 1:10:24.840\n There's been riots of all different reasons,\n\n1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:28.440\n racial division, there's been obviously a virus\n\n1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.440\n that's testing the very fabric of our society.\n\n1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:34.480\n But there's been really, for me at least,\n\n1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:36.960\n super positive things, inspiring things,\n\n1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:41.960\n which is SpaceX and NASA doing the first commercial\n\n1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:47.800\n human flight, launching humans to space\n\n1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:49.600\n and did it twice successfully.\n\n1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:54.520\n What is that, did you get to watch that launch?\n\n1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:57.000\n Did you, what does it make you feel?\n\n1:10:57.960 --> 1:11:00.960\n Do you think this is first days\n\n1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:04.480\n for a new era of space exploration?\n\n1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:06.640\n Yeah, I did watch it.\n\n1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:09.840\n We played it outside on a big screen at our place.\n\n1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:13.520\n And I was a little, they kept saying Bob and Doug,\n\n1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:18.200\n Bob and Doug, and astronauts usually are treated\n\n1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:20.680\n with a little bit more fanfare.\n\n1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:24.000\n So it felt very casual, but maybe that was a good,\n\n1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:26.280\n a good thing, like this is the era\n\n1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:30.160\n of commercial crewed missions.\n\n1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:34.000\n It was a little bit more, what is it?\n\n1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:34.840\n What's his name?\n\n1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:37.360\n Chris Hadfield, like playing guitar.\n\n1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:41.160\n It's more, it's a different flavor to it of.\n\n1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:42.560\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:11:42.560 --> 1:11:46.120\n More like fun, playful, celebrity type.\n\n1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:47.080\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:51.760\n Astronaut versus the aura of the magical\n\n1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:55.440\n sort of heroic element of the single human\n\n1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:56.920\n representing us in space.\n\n1:11:56.920 --> 1:12:00.360\n Yes, I think that's all for the better though.\n\n1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:02.960\n It's so cool that it's such a commonplace thing\n\n1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:04.600\n now that we send.\n\n1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:07.120\n I can't believe that sometimes I'll have to,\n\n1:12:07.960 --> 1:12:10.600\n you don't even realize that astronauts are coming\n\n1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:13.600\n and going all the time, splashing back down.\n\n1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:15.080\n And it's just so common now,\n\n1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:19.080\n but that's quite magical, I think.\n\n1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:20.960\n So yes, we did watch that.\n\n1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:24.760\n I love, love, love that we finally have that capability\n\n1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:27.760\n again to send people to the space station.\n\n1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:32.800\n And it's just really exciting to see the private sector\n\n1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:34.920\n stepping up to fill in where the government\n\n1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:36.200\n has pulled back in the US.\n\n1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:38.400\n And I think pulled back way too soon\n\n1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:42.520\n as far as exploration and science goes.\n\n1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:44.120\n Probably pulled back at the right time\n\n1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:47.920\n for commercial things and getting that started.\n\n1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:51.880\n But I'm really happy that it's even possible\n\n1:12:51.880 --> 1:12:55.800\n to do that with private money and companies.\n\n1:12:55.800 --> 1:12:58.520\n Do you like the kind of the model of competition\n\n1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:01.440\n of NASA funding?\n\n1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:02.520\n I guess that's how it works,\n\n1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:04.320\n is like they're providing quite a bit of money\n\n1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:08.240\n from the government and then private companies compete\n\n1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:12.400\n to be the delivery vehicles for whichever\n\n1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:17.400\n the government missions, like NASA missions.\n\n1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:20.640\n Yes, I think for this type of mission\n\n1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:25.640\n is a little bit kind of straddles commercial and science.\n\n1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:29.400\n So I think it's good, but I do in general feel\n\n1:13:29.400 --> 1:13:34.040\n like we've pulled back too much on NASA's role\n\n1:13:34.040 --> 1:13:36.960\n in the science and exploration part.\n\n1:13:36.960 --> 1:13:40.960\n And I think our pace is too slow there,\n\n1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:42.960\n for my liking, I suppose.\n\n1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:43.800\n What do you mean?\n\n1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:48.520\n Okay, so did you have, I mean, on the cost thing,\n\n1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:52.560\n do you feel like NASA was a little too bureaucratic\n\n1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:57.560\n in a sense, like too slow, too heavy cost wise\n\n1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.880\n in their effort, like when they were running things\n\n1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:03.720\n purely without any commercial involvement?\n\n1:14:03.720 --> 1:14:06.780\n So I suppose it's more that I just want\n\n1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:08.720\n the government to fund.\n\n1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:09.560\n I see, yeah.\n\n1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:12.720\n And maybe NASA's not the best organization\n\n1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:15.560\n to do it rapidly.\n\n1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:20.560\n But I think that, again, depending on the goals,\n\n1:14:20.560 --> 1:14:23.480\n we're just kind of at the very starting point\n\n1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:28.480\n of space exploration and science and understanding.\n\n1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:32.320\n So we should be spending more money there and not less.\n\n1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:34.960\n And other countries are starting to spend more and more,\n\n1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.140\n and I think we'll fall behind because of that.\n\n1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:41.000\n So you have quite a bit of experience, first of all,\n\n1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.720\n starting a company yourself, but also I saw,\n\n1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:46.800\n maybe you can correct me, but you have quite a bit\n\n1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:50.880\n of knowledge of just in general the startup experience\n\n1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:54.400\n of building companies that you've interacted with people.\n\n1:14:54.400 --> 1:14:59.400\n Is there advice that you can give to somebody,\n\n1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:02.220\n to a founder or cofounder who wants to launch\n\n1:15:02.220 --> 1:15:07.220\n and grow a new company and do something big and impactful\n\n1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:08.680\n in this world?\n\n1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:13.680\n Yes, I would say, like I mentioned earlier,\n\n1:15:13.740 --> 1:15:18.740\n but make sure the vision is something that will get you\n\n1:15:19.060 --> 1:15:23.060\n out of bed in the morning and that you can rally\n\n1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:27.180\n other people around you to achieve.\n\n1:15:27.180 --> 1:15:31.100\n Because I see a lot of folks that sort of cared\n\n1:15:31.100 --> 1:15:33.900\n about something or saw a window of opportunity\n\n1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:37.300\n to do something, and startups are hard,\n\n1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:42.300\n and more often than not, just being opportunistic\n\n1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:44.980\n isn't going to be enough to make it through\n\n1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:48.860\n all the really crappy things that are going to happen.\n\n1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:51.300\n So the vision just helps you psychologically\n\n1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:52.820\n to carry through the hardships,\n\n1:15:52.820 --> 1:15:53.660\n for you and the team.\n\n1:15:53.660 --> 1:15:56.180\n Yeah, you and the team, yeah, exactly.\n\n1:15:56.180 --> 1:15:59.100\n To kind of younger people interested in getting\n\n1:15:59.100 --> 1:16:02.240\n into entrepreneurship, I would say stay as close\n\n1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:06.700\n to first principles and fundamentals as you can\n\n1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:11.100\n for as long as you can, because really understanding\n\n1:16:11.100 --> 1:16:13.660\n the problems, if it's something scientific\n\n1:16:13.660 --> 1:16:16.780\n or hardware related, or even if it's not,\n\n1:16:16.780 --> 1:16:20.380\n but having a deep understanding of the problem\n\n1:16:20.380 --> 1:16:22.660\n and the customers and what people care about\n\n1:16:22.660 --> 1:16:26.380\n and how to move something forward is more important\n\n1:16:26.380 --> 1:16:30.480\n than taking all of the entrepreneurship classes\n\n1:16:30.480 --> 1:16:31.620\n in undergrad.\n\n1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:33.400\n So being able to think deeply, yeah.\n\n1:16:33.400 --> 1:16:35.120\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:16:35.120 --> 1:16:38.180\n Yeah, have you been surprised about how much pivoting\n\n1:16:38.180 --> 1:16:41.780\n is involved, basically rethinking what you thought\n\n1:16:41.780 --> 1:16:44.260\n initially would be the right direction to go?\n\n1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:46.540\n Or is there, if you think deeply enough,\n\n1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:50.540\n that you can stick in the same direction for long enough?\n\n1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:55.540\n So our guiding star hasn't changed at all,\n\n1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:57.860\n so that's been pretty consistent,\n\n1:16:57.860 --> 1:17:02.860\n but within that, we flip flop on so many things\n\n1:17:02.860 --> 1:17:06.020\n all the time, and to give you one example,\n\n1:17:06.020 --> 1:17:10.220\n it's do you stop and build a first product\n\n1:17:10.220 --> 1:17:14.140\n that's well suited to maybe a smaller,\n\n1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:16.660\n less exciting segment of the market,\n\n1:17:16.660 --> 1:17:21.660\n or do you stay head down and focus on the big swing\n\n1:17:22.940 --> 1:17:25.280\n and trying to hit it out of the park right away?\n\n1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:27.540\n And we've flip flopped between that,\n\n1:17:27.540 --> 1:17:30.240\n and there's not a blanket answer,\n\n1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:33.560\n and there are a lot of factors, but that's a hard one.\n\n1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:38.560\n And I think one other piece for the aspiring founder,\n\n1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:44.700\n spending a lot of time and effort on the culture\n\n1:17:44.700 --> 1:17:47.780\n and people piece is so important\n\n1:17:47.780 --> 1:17:52.060\n and is always an afterthought and something\n\n1:17:52.060 --> 1:17:57.060\n that I haven't really seen the founders or executives\n\n1:17:57.060 --> 1:18:00.860\n or executives at companies purposefully carve out time\n\n1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:04.500\n and acknowledge that, yes, this is going to take\n\n1:18:04.500 --> 1:18:06.500\n a lot of my time and resources,\n\n1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:09.480\n but you see them after the fact trying to repair\n\n1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:14.060\n the bro culture or whatever else is broken at the company.\n\n1:18:14.060 --> 1:18:16.440\n And I think that it's starting to change,\n\n1:18:16.440 --> 1:18:19.580\n but just to be aware of it from the beginning is important.\n\n1:18:19.580 --> 1:18:21.780\n Right, I guess it should be part of the vision\n\n1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:24.180\n of what kind of place you want to create,\n\n1:18:24.180 --> 1:18:28.540\n or what kind of human beings.\n\n1:18:28.540 --> 1:18:31.900\n Yeah, exactly, you can't wait five, 10 years\n\n1:18:31.900 --> 1:18:35.300\n and then just slap an HR person onto trying to fix it.\n\n1:18:35.300 --> 1:18:37.820\n It has to be thoughtful from the beginning.\n\n1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:40.940\n Yeah, don't get me started on HR people.\n\n1:18:43.780 --> 1:18:46.540\n Don't leave HR to HR people, but I'll just leave it at that.\n\n1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:48.540\n You didn't say that, I said it, okay.\n\n1:18:48.540 --> 1:18:53.540\n Yeah, HR's actual HR is really important,\n\n1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:58.540\n is so important, culture is so important.\n\n1:18:58.540 --> 1:19:03.540\n And then I also was surprised, I thought you could say,\n\n1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:06.460\n here will be our culture and our values,\n\n1:19:06.460 --> 1:19:08.900\n and that it was kind of distinct from who I\n\n1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:11.140\n and my co founder were as people,\n\n1:19:11.140 --> 1:19:12.940\n and I was like, no, that's not how that works.\n\n1:19:12.940 --> 1:19:16.480\n We just kind of ooze out our behaviors\n\n1:19:16.480 --> 1:19:18.220\n and then the company grows around that.\n\n1:19:18.220 --> 1:19:22.640\n So you have to do a lot of introspection and self work\n\n1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:24.900\n to not end up with a shitty culture.\n\n1:19:24.900 --> 1:19:27.580\n It's kind of a, it's a relationship,\n\n1:19:27.580 --> 1:19:29.700\n but it's supposed to be a relationship with two people,\n\n1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:31.620\n it's a relationship with many people.\n\n1:19:31.620 --> 1:19:32.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:19:32.440 --> 1:19:35.620\n And you communicate so much indirectly by who you are.\n\n1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:38.260\n You have to be, you have to live it, yeah.\n\n1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:42.420\n As somebody, I think about this a lot\n\n1:19:42.420 --> 1:19:45.300\n because generally I'm full of love\n\n1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:47.100\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:49.940\n but I also get really passionate\n\n1:19:49.940 --> 1:19:54.580\n and when I see somebody in the context of work, especially,\n\n1:19:54.580 --> 1:19:58.420\n when I see somebody who I know can do a much better job\n\n1:19:58.420 --> 1:20:02.980\n and they don't do a great job, I can lose my shit\n\n1:20:02.980 --> 1:20:05.700\n in a way that's like Steve Jobsian.\n\n1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:09.960\n And you have to think about exactly the right way\n\n1:20:09.960 --> 1:20:13.460\n to lose your shit if you're going to, or if at all.\n\n1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:14.900\n You have to really think through that\n\n1:20:14.900 --> 1:20:16.620\n because it sends a big signal.\n\n1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:21.180\n You know, sometimes it's okay, like if you do it deliberately,\n\n1:20:21.180 --> 1:20:23.260\n like if you're going to do it deliberately,\n\n1:20:23.260 --> 1:20:24.260\n if you're going to say like,\n\n1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:26.780\n I'm going to be the kind of person that allows this\n\n1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:27.940\n and pays the cost of it,\n\n1:20:27.940 --> 1:20:30.800\n but you can't just think it's not gonna have a cost.\n\n1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:33.480\n Yes, this was like the first thing I worked on\n\n1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:38.480\n with my leadership coach was how not to just snap at people\n\n1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:41.660\n when they were being an idiot.\n\n1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:46.660\n And first I got really good at apologizing.\n\n1:20:46.660 --> 1:20:49.700\n That was the first step because it was going to take longer\n\n1:20:49.700 --> 1:20:51.820\n to fix the behavior.\n\n1:20:51.820 --> 1:20:54.980\n And then she, I'm actually a lot better at it now\n\n1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:56.140\n and it started with things.\n\n1:20:56.140 --> 1:20:58.880\n She's like, every time you walk through a doorway,\n\n1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:03.340\n think, you know, calm and take breaths before responding.\n\n1:21:03.340 --> 1:21:05.740\n And there were all sorts of these little things we did\n\n1:21:05.740 --> 1:21:08.620\n and it was mostly just changing the habit.\n\n1:21:08.620 --> 1:21:13.180\n Yeah, oh boy, it's a long road.\n\n1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:18.180\n Okay, so people love it and we talk about books.\n\n1:21:18.180 --> 1:21:21.660\n Is there books, maybe three or so technical fiction,\n\n1:21:21.660 --> 1:21:24.700\n philosophical that had an impact on your life\n\n1:21:24.700 --> 1:21:27.460\n and you might recommend and for each,\n\n1:21:27.460 --> 1:21:30.660\n is there an idea or so that you take away from it?\n\n1:21:31.540 --> 1:21:36.540\n Yes, so I've been a voracious reader all my life\n\n1:21:36.540 --> 1:21:40.700\n and I'm always reading like three or four or five books\n\n1:21:40.700 --> 1:21:45.700\n at a time and now I use Audible a lot too\n\n1:21:46.380 --> 1:21:48.580\n and you know, podcasts and things like that.\n\n1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:54.340\n So I think the first one that stands out to me is 10,\n\n1:21:54.340 --> 1:21:57.700\n it's a novel, Tender is the Night by Fitzgerald.\n\n1:21:57.700 --> 1:22:01.180\n And I read it when I was much younger\n\n1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:03.700\n but I went back and read it recently and it's not that good.\n\n1:22:03.700 --> 1:22:07.940\n So I'm not sure why it has like such an important place\n\n1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:12.940\n in my literary history but I love Fitzgerald as an author\n\n1:22:13.380 --> 1:22:17.380\n because he's very like flowery prose\n\n1:22:17.380 --> 1:22:21.220\n that I can just picture what he's saying\n\n1:22:21.220 --> 1:22:24.860\n but he does it in such a creative way.\n\n1:22:24.860 --> 1:22:26.740\n I remember that one in particular\n\n1:22:26.740 --> 1:22:29.300\n because I read a ton as a kid too\n\n1:22:29.300 --> 1:22:33.980\n but it kind of set me, it was like the beginning of my adult\n\n1:22:33.980 --> 1:22:38.500\n reading life and getting into classics\n\n1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:43.500\n and I kind of, I do feel like they seem intimidating maybe\n\n1:22:44.740 --> 1:22:47.980\n and then I realized that they're all just like love stories.\n\n1:22:50.260 --> 1:22:51.260\n So.\n\n1:22:51.260 --> 1:22:53.140\n Yeah, isn't everything a love story?\n\n1:22:53.140 --> 1:22:54.460\n Yeah, it's really.\n\n1:22:54.460 --> 1:22:55.300\n At the bottom.\n\n1:22:55.300 --> 1:22:57.100\n Even, you know, I don't know.\n\n1:22:57.100 --> 1:23:02.100\n I was surprised that even like a lot of the Russian authors,\n\n1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:04.740\n you know, they're all just love stories.\n\n1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:05.900\n We're humans are pretty simple.\n\n1:23:05.900 --> 1:23:08.460\n There's not much to worry, there's not much to work with.\n\n1:23:08.460 --> 1:23:09.620\n So I think maybe that was it.\n\n1:23:09.620 --> 1:23:12.780\n It made like that whole world less intimidating to me\n\n1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:17.100\n and cemented my love for reading.\n\n1:23:17.100 --> 1:23:18.740\n People should have just approached the classics\n\n1:23:18.740 --> 1:23:20.620\n like there's probably a love story in here.\n\n1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:21.460\n Chick flicks, yeah.\n\n1:23:21.460 --> 1:23:24.580\n So somehow it boils down to a chick flick.\n\n1:23:24.580 --> 1:23:27.500\n So just relax and enjoy the ride.\n\n1:23:27.500 --> 1:23:28.500\n And then.\n\n1:23:28.500 --> 1:23:29.340\n So what else?\n\n1:23:30.420 --> 1:23:33.860\n Changing gears quite a bit.\n\n1:23:33.860 --> 1:23:35.900\n The Beginning of Infinity, do you know it?\n\n1:23:35.900 --> 1:23:37.460\n By David Deutsch.\n\n1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:41.380\n So he's a physicist at Cambridge or Oxford.\n\n1:23:41.380 --> 1:23:45.060\n And so I was introduced like more formally\n\n1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:47.620\n to a lot of the ideas, like a lot of the things\n\n1:23:47.620 --> 1:23:52.460\n we've talked about, he has a lot more like formalism\n\n1:23:52.460 --> 1:23:55.220\n and physics rigor around.\n\n1:23:55.220 --> 1:23:59.020\n And so I got introduced to, you know, more like jargon\n\n1:23:59.020 --> 1:24:01.060\n of how to think about some of these ideas,\n\n1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:07.780\n you know, like memes and, you know, DNA as ultimate meme,\n\n1:24:10.580 --> 1:24:15.580\n the concept of infinity and objective beauty.\n\n1:24:16.060 --> 1:24:19.220\n But he has a really strong grounding in physics.\n\n1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:20.060\n And then.\n\n1:24:20.060 --> 1:24:22.660\n There's a rigorous way of talking about these like big.\n\n1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:23.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:28.140\n So that was very mind opening to me to read that.\n\n1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:30.740\n But it also, I think it's probably part of why\n\n1:24:30.740 --> 1:24:33.620\n I ended up marrying my husband is related to that book.\n\n1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.420\n And then I've had some other really great connections\n\n1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:40.020\n with people because I had read it and so had they.\n\n1:24:40.020 --> 1:24:43.020\n I like how you turned that, even that book\n\n1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:44.260\n into a love story.\n\n1:24:44.260 --> 1:24:45.660\n I did, oh no.\n\n1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:46.500\n Somehow.\n\n1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:47.740\n No, it's good, it's good.\n\n1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:49.340\n Your robot has a heart.\n\n1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:50.580\n Exactly.\n\n1:24:50.580 --> 1:24:55.580\n And okay, the third series is, it's just, it's Harry Potter.\n\n1:24:57.580 --> 1:24:59.700\n Of course, which somehow connects to,\n\n1:24:59.700 --> 1:25:01.140\n I haven't read Harry Potter.\n\n1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:01.980\n I'm really sorry.\n\n1:25:01.980 --> 1:25:02.820\n Oh no.\n\n1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:04.660\n Forgive me, forgive me.\n\n1:25:05.540 --> 1:25:08.260\n But I've read Tolkien, but just Harry Potter,\n\n1:25:08.260 --> 1:25:09.860\n just haven't gotten to it.\n\n1:25:09.860 --> 1:25:12.460\n But your company name is somehow I think\n\n1:25:12.460 --> 1:25:13.300\n connected to Harry Potter, right?\n\n1:25:13.300 --> 1:25:14.140\n Yes.\n\n1:25:14.140 --> 1:25:15.380\n I think I heard this.\n\n1:25:15.380 --> 1:25:20.380\n My, I always feel like I have to justify my fandom.\n\n1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:25.060\n The first three books came out when I was 10.\n\n1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:28.980\n So I went along this journey with Harry, age wise.\n\n1:25:28.980 --> 1:25:33.980\n And I read them all like nine or 10 times, all seven books.\n\n1:25:34.900 --> 1:25:39.380\n And I think anything that just keeps you reading\n\n1:25:39.380 --> 1:25:41.540\n is what's important.\n\n1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:44.580\n And I have lulls where I don't feel like reading anything.\n\n1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:49.580\n So I'll reread a Harry Potter or a trashy detective novel\n\n1:25:50.580 --> 1:25:52.340\n or something, and I don't really care.\n\n1:25:52.340 --> 1:25:55.100\n And that's why I mentioned Harry Potter\n\n1:25:55.100 --> 1:25:58.620\n because whatever just keeps me reading,\n\n1:25:58.620 --> 1:25:59.700\n I think is important.\n\n1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:02.820\n And it was a big part of my life growing up.\n\n1:26:02.820 --> 1:26:07.820\n And then yes, Axion, the official story of the naming\n\n1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:12.900\n of the company is that Axion is like a concatenation\n\n1:26:12.900 --> 1:26:15.380\n of accelerate and ion.\n\n1:26:15.380 --> 1:26:18.820\n But it actually came from accio, the summoning charm.\n\n1:26:18.820 --> 1:26:21.500\n And then we just added an N and it was perfect.\n\n1:26:22.500 --> 1:26:23.700\n What's the summoning charm?\n\n1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:25.460\n It's one of the spells in Harry Potter.\n\n1:26:25.460 --> 1:26:30.460\n Yeah, probably most notably Harry uses it\n\n1:26:31.740 --> 1:26:35.420\n to summon his broomstick out of his dorm room\n\n1:26:35.420 --> 1:26:37.820\n when he's battling a dragon somewhere else.\n\n1:26:37.820 --> 1:26:40.180\n So he says the spell and the broomstick comes to him.\n\n1:26:40.180 --> 1:26:43.020\n So summoning in that way.\n\n1:26:43.020 --> 1:26:44.740\n Okay, there we go.\n\n1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:45.740\n This is brilliant.\n\n1:26:45.740 --> 1:26:48.820\n So the big thing is that it's something\n\n1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:52.820\n that you've carry with, it's like your safe place\n\n1:26:52.820 --> 1:26:55.300\n you return to something like the Harry Potter.\n\n1:26:55.300 --> 1:26:59.980\n That, I reread them still, whatever keeps me reading\n\n1:26:59.980 --> 1:27:02.980\n I think is the most important thing.\n\n1:27:02.980 --> 1:27:03.820\n Okay, I got it.\n\n1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:07.660\n So I'm actually the same way in terms of the habit of it.\n\n1:27:07.660 --> 1:27:12.620\n It's important to just keep reading.\n\n1:27:12.620 --> 1:27:16.620\n But I have found myself struggling a little bit too\n\n1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:19.140\n because I listen to a lot of audio books now.\n\n1:27:19.140 --> 1:27:24.140\n I've struggled to then switch back to reading seriously.\n\n1:27:26.020 --> 1:27:27.540\n It's just I read so many papers,\n\n1:27:27.540 --> 1:27:28.980\n I read so many other things.\n\n1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:30.620\n It feels like if I'm gonna sit down\n\n1:27:30.620 --> 1:27:33.580\n and have the time to actually focus on the reading\n\n1:27:33.580 --> 1:27:36.740\n I should be reading like blog posts or papers\n\n1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:38.940\n or more condensed kind of things.\n\n1:27:38.940 --> 1:27:42.700\n But there's a huge value to just reading long form still.\n\n1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:47.460\n Yeah, and my husband was never that into fiction\n\n1:27:47.460 --> 1:27:50.580\n but then someone told him or he heard,\n\n1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:55.140\n you learn a lot of empathy through reading fiction.\n\n1:27:55.140 --> 1:27:56.780\n So you could think of it that way.\n\n1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:58.700\n Well, yeah, that's kind of what, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:27:58.700 --> 1:28:00.620\n And it's also fiction is a nice,\n\n1:28:01.460 --> 1:28:06.340\n unlike not less so with nonfiction is a chance to travel.\n\n1:28:06.340 --> 1:28:08.260\n I see it as kind of traveling.\n\n1:28:08.260 --> 1:28:11.340\n As you go to this other world and it's nice\n\n1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:12.700\n because it's like much more efficient.\n\n1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:14.140\n You don't have to get on a plane,\n\n1:28:14.140 --> 1:28:17.540\n and you get to meet all kinds of new people.\n\n1:28:17.540 --> 1:28:19.860\n It's like people say they love traveling\n\n1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:21.300\n and I say I love traveling too.\n\n1:28:21.300 --> 1:28:23.140\n I just, yeah, read fiction.\n\n1:28:23.140 --> 1:28:28.140\n I told my three year old that that was why we read so much\n\n1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:32.540\n because we see the places in our mind\n\n1:28:32.540 --> 1:28:36.180\n and I'm like, it's basically like we're watching a movie.\n\n1:28:36.180 --> 1:28:37.020\n That's how it feels.\n\n1:28:37.020 --> 1:28:39.580\n And she's like, I prefer watching Frozen with popcorn,\n\n1:28:39.580 --> 1:28:41.980\n was her response that.\n\n1:28:41.980 --> 1:28:43.540\n Okay, well, you're three.\n\n1:28:43.540 --> 1:28:45.260\n That's a good point.\n\n1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:47.620\n But yeah, there's some power to the imagination, right?\n\n1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:49.460\n That's not just like watching a movie\n\n1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:53.260\n because something about our imagination\n\n1:28:53.260 --> 1:28:56.740\n because it's the words in the world that's painted\n\n1:28:56.740 --> 1:29:00.100\n somehow mixing in with our own understanding\n\n1:29:00.100 --> 1:29:02.580\n of our own hopes and dreams, our fears.\n\n1:29:02.580 --> 1:29:03.820\n It like mixes up in there\n\n1:29:03.820 --> 1:29:07.660\n and the way we can build up that world from just the page.\n\n1:29:07.660 --> 1:29:10.260\n Yeah, you're really creating the world\n\n1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:13.340\n just with the prompts from the book, right?\n\n1:29:13.340 --> 1:29:15.900\n Yeah, that's different than watching a movie.\n\n1:29:15.900 --> 1:29:17.380\n Yeah, which is why it hurts sometimes\n\n1:29:17.380 --> 1:29:19.220\n to watch the movie version\n\n1:29:19.220 --> 1:29:23.660\n and then you're like, that's not at all how I imagined it.\n\n1:29:23.660 --> 1:29:26.740\n Well, we kind of brought this up in terms of\n\n1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:31.700\n depending on what the goals are.\n\n1:29:31.700 --> 1:29:35.060\n Let me ask the big, you're friends with Manolis,\n\n1:29:35.060 --> 1:29:36.620\n he's obsessed with this question.\n\n1:29:36.620 --> 1:29:38.460\n So let me ask the big ridiculous question\n\n1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:40.540\n about the meaning of life.\n\n1:29:41.820 --> 1:29:44.140\n Do you ever think about this one?\n\n1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:49.140\n Do you ever ponder the reason we're here?\n\n1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:52.860\n Descends as the vapes on this spinning ball\n\n1:29:52.860 --> 1:29:54.060\n in the middle of nowhere?\n\n1:29:54.060 --> 1:29:57.620\n Yeah, I don't think one ends up\n\n1:29:57.620 --> 1:29:59.820\n in the field of space propulsion\n\n1:29:59.820 --> 1:30:04.460\n without thinking of these existential questions.\n\n1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:05.780\n Yeah, all the time.\n\n1:30:05.780 --> 1:30:07.220\n Or builds a business.\n\n1:30:07.220 --> 1:30:09.540\n Yeah, I know, right?\n\n1:30:09.540 --> 1:30:12.900\n Yeah, we've touched on a lot of the different pieces\n\n1:30:12.900 --> 1:30:13.820\n of this, I think.\n\n1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:18.820\n So I have a bunch of thoughts.\n\n1:30:18.860 --> 1:30:23.260\n I do think that the goal isn't,\n\n1:30:23.260 --> 1:30:28.260\n the meaning isn't anymore just to be like a Petri dish\n\n1:30:28.260 --> 1:30:31.060\n of bacteria that reproduces\n\n1:30:31.060 --> 1:30:36.060\n and where survival and reproduction are the main objectives.\n\n1:30:36.660 --> 1:30:40.460\n And maybe it's because now we're able to answer these,\n\n1:30:40.460 --> 1:30:42.500\n ask those questions.\n\n1:30:42.500 --> 1:30:44.900\n That's maybe the turning point.\n\n1:30:45.900 --> 1:30:49.540\n And instead, I think it's really the pursuit\n\n1:30:49.540 --> 1:30:52.060\n and generation of knowledge.\n\n1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:56.860\n And so if we're taken out by an asteroid or something,\n\n1:30:56.860 --> 1:31:01.860\n I think that it will have been a meaningful endeavor\n\n1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:06.860\n if somehow our knowledge about the universe\n\n1:31:06.860 --> 1:31:11.860\n is preserved somehow and the next civilization\n\n1:31:12.620 --> 1:31:14.780\n isn't starting over again.\n\n1:31:16.340 --> 1:31:21.340\n So that's, I always, yeah, I resonate with that.\n\n1:31:21.860 --> 1:31:25.300\n I always loved the mission of Google from the early days\n\n1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:28.660\n of making the world's sort of information\n\n1:31:28.660 --> 1:31:30.660\n and knowledge searchable.\n\n1:31:30.660 --> 1:31:31.700\n I always loved that idea.\n\n1:31:31.700 --> 1:31:35.660\n I always loved, I was donated as people should to Wikipedia.\n\n1:31:37.020 --> 1:31:38.500\n I just love Wikipedia.\n\n1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:43.340\n I feel like it's the, that's one of the greatest\n\n1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:46.340\n accomplishments of just a humanity of us together,\n\n1:31:46.340 --> 1:31:48.620\n especially Wikipedia and this opens like\n\n1:31:48.620 --> 1:31:50.140\n in this open community way,\n\n1:31:50.140 --> 1:31:52.620\n putting together different knowledge is like,\n\n1:31:52.620 --> 1:31:53.940\n on everything we've talked about today,\n\n1:31:53.940 --> 1:31:57.540\n I'm sure there's a Wikipedia page about ion engines\n\n1:31:57.540 --> 1:31:59.500\n and I'm sure it's pretty good.\n\n1:31:59.500 --> 1:32:02.420\n Like, it's, I don't know, that's incredible.\n\n1:32:02.420 --> 1:32:05.180\n And obviously that can be preserved pretty efficiently,\n\n1:32:05.180 --> 1:32:06.540\n at least Wikipedia.\n\n1:32:06.540 --> 1:32:09.260\n I don't know, you'll be like, human civilization\n\n1:32:09.260 --> 1:32:11.500\n is all like burning up in flames\n\n1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:14.300\n as there's this one USB drive slowly traveling out.\n\n1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:15.140\n Yeah, I know, exactly.\n\n1:32:15.140 --> 1:32:16.420\n With Wikipedia on it.\n\n1:32:16.420 --> 1:32:17.700\n Yep.\n\n1:32:17.700 --> 1:32:20.460\n That's on, from the beginning of our chat,\n\n1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:22.420\n that one lonely spacecraft.\n\n1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:24.940\n It just needs Wikipedia.\n\n1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:28.700\n And then it will have been a civilization well spent.\n\n1:32:28.700 --> 1:32:30.900\n So pushing that knowledge along.\n\n1:32:30.900 --> 1:32:31.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:31.740 --> 1:32:35.060\n Through like one little discovery at a time\n\n1:32:35.060 --> 1:32:39.100\n is one of, is a core aspect to the meaning of it all.\n\n1:32:39.100 --> 1:32:42.860\n Yes, and I also, I haven't yet figured out\n\n1:32:42.860 --> 1:32:46.740\n what the connection, you know, an explanation\n\n1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:48.940\n I'm happy with yet for how it's connected,\n\n1:32:48.940 --> 1:32:53.940\n but evolving beyond just the survival piece too,\n\n1:32:55.300 --> 1:32:59.460\n I think like we touched on the emotional aspect,\n\n1:32:59.460 --> 1:33:04.180\n something in there about cooperation and, you know, love.\n\n1:33:04.180 --> 1:33:08.900\n And so I, in my day to day that just boils down to,\n\n1:33:08.900 --> 1:33:11.340\n you know, the pursuit of knowledge\n\n1:33:11.340 --> 1:33:16.340\n or improving the human condition and being kind.\n\n1:33:16.500 --> 1:33:18.140\n Love and knowledge.\n\n1:33:18.140 --> 1:33:19.860\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:33:19.860 --> 1:33:23.740\n So I'm pretty at peace with that as the meaning right now.\n\n1:33:23.740 --> 1:33:24.580\n Makes sense to me.\n\n1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:27.980\n While you work on spacecraft propulsion.\n\n1:33:27.980 --> 1:33:29.820\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:33:29.820 --> 1:33:32.100\n Like literal rocket science.\n\n1:33:32.100 --> 1:33:34.100\n Natalia, this is an amazing conversation.\n\n1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:36.740\n You work on such an exciting engineering field.\n\n1:33:36.740 --> 1:33:40.860\n And I think this is like what 20th, 21st century\n\n1:33:40.860 --> 1:33:43.140\n will be remembered for is space exploration.\n\n1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:46.820\n So this is super exciting space that you're working on.\n\n1:33:46.820 --> 1:33:48.860\n So, and thank you so much\n\n1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:50.940\n for spending your time with me today.\n\n1:33:50.940 --> 1:33:51.940\n Thanks for having me.\n\n1:33:51.940 --> 1:33:52.780\n This was fun.\n\n1:33:53.620 --> 1:33:55.300\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:33:55.300 --> 1:33:56.540\n with Natalia Bailey.\n\n1:33:56.540 --> 1:33:58.420\n And thank you to our sponsors,\n\n1:33:58.420 -->
