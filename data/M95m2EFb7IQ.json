chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates,\n\n00:08.560 --> 00:09.840\n one of the world's largest\n\n00:09.840 --> 00:11.920\n and most successful investment firms\n\n00:11.920 --> 00:14.640\n that is famous for the principles of radical truth\n\n00:14.640 --> 00:17.880\n and transparency that underlies culture.\n\n00:17.880 --> 00:20.760\n Ray is one of the wealthiest people in the world\n\n00:20.760 --> 00:23.160\n with ideas that extend far beyond the specifics\n\n00:23.160 --> 00:24.920\n of how he made that wealth.\n\n00:24.920 --> 00:27.400\n His ideas that are applicable to everyone\n\n00:27.400 --> 00:30.660\n are brilliantly summarized in his book, Principles.\n\n00:30.660 --> 00:32.760\n They're also even further condensed\n\n00:32.760 --> 00:35.280\n on several other platforms, including YouTube,\n\n00:35.280 --> 00:38.600\n where, for example, the 30 minute video titled\n\n00:38.600 --> 00:40.720\n How the Economic Machine Works\n\n00:40.720 --> 00:43.420\n is one of the best educational videos\n\n00:43.420 --> 00:46.560\n I personally have ever seen on YouTube.\n\n00:46.560 --> 00:49.040\n Once again, you may have noticed\n\n00:49.040 --> 00:50.600\n that the people I've been speaking with\n\n00:50.600 --> 00:52.520\n are not just computer scientists,\n\n00:52.520 --> 00:55.040\n but philosophers, mathematicians, writers,\n\n00:55.040 --> 00:57.520\n psychologists, physicists, economists, investors,\n\n00:57.520 --> 00:59.600\n and soon, much more.\n\n00:59.600 --> 01:03.000\n To me, AI is much bigger than deep learning,\n\n01:03.000 --> 01:04.440\n bigger than computing.\n\n01:04.440 --> 01:06.200\n It is our civilization's journey\n\n01:06.200 --> 01:08.160\n into understanding the human mind\n\n01:08.160 --> 01:10.880\n and creating echoes of it in the machine.\n\n01:10.880 --> 01:14.000\n That journey includes the mechanisms of our economy,\n\n01:14.000 --> 01:15.880\n of our politics, and the leaders\n\n01:15.880 --> 01:18.080\n that shape the future of both.\n\n01:18.080 --> 01:21.200\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:21.200 --> 01:23.560\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:23.560 --> 01:25.640\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:25.640 --> 01:27.080\n support it on Patreon,\n\n01:27.080 --> 01:29.240\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:29.240 --> 01:32.680\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:33.840 --> 01:35.940\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:35.940 --> 01:38.460\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:38.460 --> 01:41.200\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n01:41.200 --> 01:44.640\n but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin.\n\n01:44.640 --> 01:46.440\n Most Bitcoin exchanges take days\n\n01:46.440 --> 01:48.680\n for a bank transfer to become investable.\n\n01:48.680 --> 01:51.040\n Through Cash App, it takes seconds.\n\n01:51.040 --> 01:54.360\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n01:54.360 --> 01:56.120\n You can buy fractions of a stock,\n\n01:56.120 --> 01:58.880\n which to me is a really interesting concept.\n\n01:58.880 --> 02:03.120\n So you can buy $1 worth no matter what the stock price is.\n\n02:03.120 --> 02:06.080\n Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n02:06.080 --> 02:09.840\n subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.\n\n02:09.840 --> 02:11.680\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:14.360\n to support one of my favorite organizations\n\n02:14.360 --> 02:17.320\n that many of you may know and have benefited from\n\n02:17.320 --> 02:20.760\n called First, best known for their first robotics\n\n02:20.760 --> 02:22.480\n and Lego competitions.\n\n02:22.480 --> 02:26.160\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n02:26.160 --> 02:29.240\n in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating\n\n02:29.240 --> 02:32.200\n on Charity Navigator, which means the donated money\n\n02:32.200 --> 02:35.540\n is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n02:35.540 --> 02:38.560\n When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n02:38.560 --> 02:42.080\n and use code LexPodcast, you'll get $10\n\n02:42.080 --> 02:44.800\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n02:44.800 --> 02:47.880\n which again is an organization that I've personally seen\n\n02:47.880 --> 02:51.400\n inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering\n\n02:51.400 --> 02:52.480\n a better world.\n\n02:52.480 --> 02:55.920\n And now here's my conversation with Ray Dalio.\n\n02:56.920 --> 02:59.600\n Truth or more precisely an accurate understanding\n\n02:59.600 --> 03:03.360\n of reality is the essential foundation of any good outcome.\n\n03:03.360 --> 03:05.720\n I believe you've said that.\n\n03:05.720 --> 03:08.640\n Let me ask an absurd sounding question\n\n03:08.640 --> 03:10.880\n at the high philosophical level.\n\n03:10.880 --> 03:12.800\n So what is truth?\n\n03:12.800 --> 03:14.960\n When you're trying to do something different\n\n03:14.960 --> 03:16.760\n than everybody else is doing\n\n03:16.760 --> 03:19.800\n and perhaps something that has not been done before,\n\n03:19.800 --> 03:23.520\n how do you accurately analyze the situation?\n\n03:23.520 --> 03:25.440\n How do you accurately discover the truth,\n\n03:25.440 --> 03:27.320\n the nature of things?\n\n03:27.320 --> 03:30.320\n Almost the way you're asking the question implies\n\n03:30.320 --> 03:35.200\n that truth and newness have nothing, are almost at odds.\n\n03:35.200 --> 03:37.360\n And I just want to say that I don't think\n\n03:37.360 --> 03:39.040\n that that's true, right?\n\n03:39.040 --> 03:43.600\n So what I mean by truth is, you know, what's the reality?\n\n03:43.600 --> 03:45.480\n How does the reality work?\n\n03:45.480 --> 03:47.800\n And so if you're doing something new\n\n03:47.800 --> 03:49.080\n that has never been done before,\n\n03:49.080 --> 03:51.320\n which is exciting and I like to do,\n\n03:51.320 --> 03:54.000\n the way that you would start with that\n\n03:54.000 --> 03:57.160\n is experimenting on what are the realities\n\n03:57.160 --> 03:59.440\n and the premises that you're using on that\n\n03:59.440 --> 04:01.880\n and how to stress test those types of things.\n\n04:01.880 --> 04:04.360\n I think what you're talking about is instead\n\n04:04.360 --> 04:06.320\n the fact of how do you deal with something\n\n04:06.320 --> 04:08.040\n that's never been done before\n\n04:08.040 --> 04:11.160\n and deal with the associated probabilities.\n\n04:11.160 --> 04:13.320\n And so I think in that,\n\n04:13.320 --> 04:15.720\n don't let something that's never been done before\n\n04:15.720 --> 04:20.160\n stand in the way of you doing that particular thing.\n\n04:20.160 --> 04:22.720\n You have, because almost the only way\n\n04:22.720 --> 04:25.160\n that you understand what truth is,\n\n04:25.160 --> 04:27.240\n is through experimentation.\n\n04:27.240 --> 04:29.440\n And so when you go out and experiment,\n\n04:29.440 --> 04:32.320\n you're going to learn a lot more about what truth is.\n\n04:32.320 --> 04:35.840\n But the essence of what I'm saying is that\n\n04:35.840 --> 04:38.960\n when you take a look at that, use truth,\n\n04:38.960 --> 04:41.720\n find out what the realities are as a foundation,\n\n04:41.720 --> 04:43.560\n do the independent thinking,\n\n04:43.560 --> 04:47.120\n do the experimentation to find out what's true\n\n04:47.120 --> 04:50.400\n and change and keep going after that.\n\n04:50.400 --> 04:54.320\n So I think that when you're thinking about it\n\n04:54.320 --> 04:56.040\n the way you're thinking about it,\n\n04:56.040 --> 05:00.600\n that almost implies that you're letting people\n\n05:00.600 --> 05:03.160\n almost say that they're reliant\n\n05:03.160 --> 05:06.480\n on what's been discovered before to find out what's true.\n\n05:06.480 --> 05:11.200\n And what's been discovered before is often not true, right?\n\n05:11.200 --> 05:16.200\n Conventional view of what is true is very often wrong.\n\n05:16.360 --> 05:19.800\n It'll go in ups and downs and I mean, there are fads\n\n05:19.800 --> 05:22.360\n and okay, this thing, it goes this way and that way.\n\n05:22.360 --> 05:25.880\n And so definitions of truths that are conventional\n\n05:25.880 --> 05:28.720\n are not the thing to go by.\n\n05:28.720 --> 05:32.280\n How do you know the thing that has been done before\n\n05:32.280 --> 05:33.880\n that it might succeed?\n\n05:33.880 --> 05:37.840\n It's to do whatever homework that you have\n\n05:37.840 --> 05:40.000\n in order to try to get a foundation.\n\n05:40.000 --> 05:43.080\n And then to go into worlds of not knowing\n\n05:43.080 --> 05:45.200\n and you go into the world of not knowing,\n\n05:45.200 --> 05:48.920\n but not stupidly, not naively, you know,\n\n05:48.920 --> 05:51.160\n you go into that world of not knowing\n\n05:51.160 --> 05:54.960\n and then you do experimenting and you learn what truth is\n\n05:54.960 --> 05:57.680\n and what's possible through that process.\n\n05:57.680 --> 05:59.960\n I describe it as a five step process.\n\n05:59.960 --> 06:02.080\n The first step is you go after your goals.\n\n06:02.080 --> 06:04.800\n The second step is you identify the problems\n\n06:04.800 --> 06:07.180\n that stand in the way of you getting to your goals.\n\n06:07.180 --> 06:09.320\n The third step is you diagnose those\n\n06:09.320 --> 06:11.360\n to get at the root cause of those.\n\n06:11.360 --> 06:13.760\n Then the fourth step is then now that you know\n\n06:13.760 --> 06:17.880\n the exact root cause, you design a way to get around those\n\n06:17.880 --> 06:21.080\n and then you follow through and do the designs\n\n06:21.080 --> 06:23.900\n you set out to do and it's the experimentation.\n\n06:23.900 --> 06:27.480\n I think that what happens to people mostly\n\n06:27.480 --> 06:31.120\n is that they try to decide whether they're gonna be\n\n06:31.120 --> 06:34.040\n successful or not ahead of doing it\n\n06:34.040 --> 06:36.160\n and they don't know how to do the process well\n\n06:36.160 --> 06:39.560\n because the nature of your questions are along those lines\n\n06:39.560 --> 06:40.760\n like how do you know?\n\n06:40.760 --> 06:43.680\n Well, you don't know, but a practical person\n\n06:43.680 --> 06:47.220\n who is also used to making dreams happen\n\n06:47.220 --> 06:48.840\n knows how to do that process.\n\n06:48.840 --> 06:52.580\n I've given personality tests to shapers.\n\n06:52.580 --> 06:56.000\n So the person, what I mean by a shaper is a person\n\n06:56.000 --> 07:00.320\n who can take something from visualization,\n\n07:00.320 --> 07:02.980\n they have an audacious goal and then they go\n\n07:02.980 --> 07:06.140\n from visualization to actualization, building it out.\n\n07:06.140 --> 07:10.320\n That includes Elon Musk, I gave him the personality test,\n\n07:10.320 --> 07:12.900\n I've given it to Bill Gates and I've given it to many,\n\n07:12.900 --> 07:17.320\n many such shapers and they know that process\n\n07:17.320 --> 07:19.920\n that I'm talking about, they experience it\n\n07:19.920 --> 07:22.440\n which is a process essentially of knowing\n\n07:22.440 --> 07:24.420\n how to go from an audacious goal\n\n07:24.420 --> 07:27.800\n but not in a ridiculous way, not a dream\n\n07:27.800 --> 07:31.600\n and then to do that learning along the way\n\n07:31.600 --> 07:34.360\n that allows them in a very practical way\n\n07:34.360 --> 07:38.240\n to learn very rapidly as they're moving toward that goal.\n\n07:38.240 --> 07:42.240\n So the call to adventure, the adventure starts\n\n07:42.240 --> 07:44.680\n not trying to analyze the probabilities of the situation\n\n07:44.680 --> 07:48.120\n but using what, instinct?\n\n07:48.120 --> 07:49.400\n How do you dive in?\n\n07:49.400 --> 07:50.880\n So let's talk about.\n\n07:50.880 --> 07:54.960\n It is being a, it's simultaneously being a dreamer\n\n07:54.960 --> 07:58.680\n and a realist, it's to know how to do that well.\n\n07:58.680 --> 08:01.820\n The pull comes from a pull to adventure.\n\n08:01.820 --> 08:05.160\n For whatever reason, I can't tell you how much\n\n08:05.160 --> 08:07.680\n of it's genetics and how much is environment\n\n08:07.680 --> 08:11.440\n but there's a early on, it's exciting.\n\n08:11.440 --> 08:15.440\n That notion is exciting, being creative is exciting\n\n08:15.440 --> 08:19.160\n and so one feels that, then one gets in the habit\n\n08:19.160 --> 08:21.440\n of doing that, okay, how do I know?\n\n08:21.440 --> 08:25.560\n How do I learn very well and then how do I imagine\n\n08:25.560 --> 08:30.560\n and then how do I experiment to go from that imagination?\n\n08:30.560 --> 08:34.800\n So it's that process that one, and then one,\n\n08:34.800 --> 08:38.900\n the more one does it, the better one becomes at it.\n\n08:40.120 --> 08:44.160\n You mentioned shapers, Elon Musk, Bill Gates.\n\n08:44.160 --> 08:47.560\n What, who are the shapers that you find yourself\n\n08:47.560 --> 08:51.120\n thinking about when you're constructing these ideas?\n\n08:51.120 --> 08:54.400\n The ones that define the archetype of a shaper for you.\n\n08:54.400 --> 08:57.400\n Well, as I say, a shaper for me is somebody\n\n08:57.400 --> 09:01.160\n who comes up with a great visualization,\n\n09:02.080 --> 09:04.720\n usually a really unique visualization\n\n09:04.720 --> 09:08.560\n and then actually builds it out and makes the world different,\n\n09:08.560 --> 09:10.800\n changes the world in that kind of a way.\n\n09:10.800 --> 09:14.640\n So when I look at it, Mark Benioff with Salesforce,\n\n09:14.640 --> 09:17.920\n Chris Anderson with TED, Mohammed Yunus\n\n09:17.920 --> 09:20.480\n with social enterprise and philanthropy,\n\n09:20.480 --> 09:23.520\n Jeffrey Canada and Harlem Children's Zone,\n\n09:23.520 --> 09:28.520\n there are, all domains have shapers who have the ability\n\n09:28.920 --> 09:32.440\n to visualize and make extraordinary things happen.\n\n09:32.440 --> 09:35.000\n What are the commonalities between some of them?\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:38.960\n The commonalities are, first of all,\n\n09:38.960 --> 09:43.280\n the excitement of something new, that call to adventure,\n\n09:43.280 --> 09:47.920\n and then again, that practicality, the capacity to learn.\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:51.760\n The capacity then, they're able to be,\n\n09:51.760 --> 09:53.640\n in many ways, full rage.\n\n09:53.640 --> 09:55.480\n That means they're able to go\n\n09:55.480 --> 09:59.360\n from the big, big picture down to the detail.\n\n09:59.360 --> 10:02.360\n So let's say, for example, Elon Musk,\n\n10:02.360 --> 10:06.000\n he describes, he gets a lot of money\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:09.600\n from selling PayPal, his interest in PayPal.\n\n10:09.600 --> 10:14.000\n He said, why isn't anybody going to Mars or outer space?\n\n10:14.000 --> 10:16.120\n What are we gonna do if the planet goes to hell?\n\n10:16.120 --> 10:18.200\n And how are we gonna get that?\n\n10:18.200 --> 10:19.920\n And nobody's paying attention to that.\n\n10:19.920 --> 10:21.560\n He doesn't know much about it.\n\n10:21.560 --> 10:24.400\n He then reads and learns and so on.\n\n10:24.400 --> 10:27.480\n Says, I'm gonna take, okay, half of my money,\n\n10:27.480 --> 10:29.600\n and I'm gonna put it in there,\n\n10:29.600 --> 10:31.240\n and I'm gonna do this thing, and he learns,\n\n10:31.240 --> 10:32.200\n and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\n\n10:32.200 --> 10:33.400\n and he's got creative, okay.\n\n10:33.400 --> 10:35.000\n That's one dimension.\n\n10:35.000 --> 10:39.480\n So he gave me the keys to his car,\n\n10:39.480 --> 10:42.280\n but this was just early days in Tesla,\n\n10:42.280 --> 10:45.640\n and he then points out the details.\n\n10:45.640 --> 10:48.720\n Okay, if you push this button here, it's this,\n\n10:48.720 --> 10:53.180\n the detail that, so he's simultaneously talking\n\n10:53.180 --> 10:56.020\n about the big, the big, big, big picture.\n\n10:56.020 --> 10:59.920\n Okay, when does humanity going to abandon the planet?\n\n10:59.920 --> 11:03.480\n But he will then be able to take it down into the detail\n\n11:03.480 --> 11:06.280\n so he can go, let's call it helicoptering.\n\n11:06.280 --> 11:07.840\n He can go up, he can go down,\n\n11:07.840 --> 11:09.800\n and see things at those types of perspective.\n\n11:09.800 --> 11:11.560\n And then you've seen that with the other shapers.\n\n11:11.560 --> 11:14.120\n And that's a common thing that they can do that.\n\n11:14.120 --> 11:18.440\n Another important difference that they have in mind\n\n11:18.440 --> 11:21.120\n is how they deal with people.\n\n11:21.120 --> 11:24.280\n I mean, meaning there's nothing more important\n\n11:24.280 --> 11:25.960\n than achieving the mission.\n\n11:25.960 --> 11:30.960\n And so what they have in common is that there's a test\n\n11:30.960 --> 11:34.080\n that I give these personality tests,\n\n11:34.080 --> 11:36.400\n because they're very helpful for understanding people.\n\n11:36.400 --> 11:38.720\n And so I gave it to all these shapers.\n\n11:38.720 --> 11:42.280\n And one of the things in workplace inventory test\n\n11:42.280 --> 11:45.880\n is this test, and it has a category called concern for others.\n\n11:45.880 --> 11:49.600\n They're all having concern for others.\n\n11:49.600 --> 11:51.280\n This includes Muhammad Yunus,\n\n11:51.280 --> 11:54.760\n who invented microfinance, social enterprise,\n\n11:54.760 --> 11:57.320\n impact investing, as Muhammad Yunus received\n\n11:57.320 --> 11:59.640\n the Nobel Peace Prize for this,\n\n11:59.640 --> 12:01.680\n the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\n12:01.680 --> 12:04.280\n One of the, a fortune determined,\n\n12:04.280 --> 12:08.960\n one of the 10 greatest entrepreneurs of our time.\n\n12:08.960 --> 12:12.400\n He's built all sorts of businesses to give back money\n\n12:12.400 --> 12:14.920\n in social enterprise, a remarkable man.\n\n12:14.920 --> 12:17.440\n He has nobody that I know practically\n\n12:17.440 --> 12:20.320\n could have more concern for others.\n\n12:20.320 --> 12:22.400\n He lives a life of a saint.\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:24.200\n I mean, a very modest lifestyle,\n\n12:24.200 --> 12:27.320\n and he puts all his money into trying to help others.\n\n12:27.320 --> 12:30.160\n And he tests low on what's called concern for others,\n\n12:30.160 --> 12:33.280\n because what it really, those questions under that\n\n12:33.280 --> 12:36.880\n are questions about conflict to get at the mission.\n\n12:36.880 --> 12:38.840\n So they all, Jeffrey Canada,\n\n12:38.840 --> 12:40.560\n who changed Harlem Children's Zone\n\n12:40.560 --> 12:42.920\n and developed that to take children in Harlem\n\n12:42.920 --> 12:44.200\n and get them well taken care of,\n\n12:44.200 --> 12:47.040\n not only just in their education, but their whole lives.\n\n12:47.040 --> 12:49.560\n Harlem, him also, concern for others.\n\n12:49.560 --> 12:53.680\n What they mean is that they can see\n\n12:53.680 --> 12:58.080\n whether though individuals are performing at a level\n\n12:58.080 --> 13:00.640\n that an extremely high level\n\n13:00.640 --> 13:03.520\n that's necessary to make those dreams happen.\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:06.600\n So when you think of, let's say Steve Jobs was famous\n\n13:06.600 --> 13:09.840\n for being difficult with people and so on,\n\n13:09.840 --> 13:11.160\n and I didn't know Steve Jobs,\n\n13:11.160 --> 13:13.120\n so I can't speak personally to that,\n\n13:13.120 --> 13:15.800\n but his comments on, do you have A players?\n\n13:15.800 --> 13:17.800\n And if you have A players, if you put in B players,\n\n13:17.800 --> 13:19.840\n pretty soon you'll have C players and so on.\n\n13:19.840 --> 13:22.080\n That is a common element of them,\n\n13:22.080 --> 13:24.000\n holding people to high standards\n\n13:24.000 --> 13:28.320\n and not letting anybody stand in the way of the mission.\n\n13:28.320 --> 13:30.120\n What do you think about that kind of idea?\n\n13:30.120 --> 13:31.620\n Sorry to pause on that for a second,\n\n13:31.620 --> 13:35.840\n that the A, B, and C players,\n\n13:35.840 --> 13:39.420\n and the importance of, so when you have a mission,\n\n13:39.420 --> 13:41.120\n to really only have A players\n\n13:41.120 --> 13:45.280\n and be sort of aggressively filtering for that?\n\n13:45.280 --> 13:47.400\n Yes, but I think that there are all different ways\n\n13:47.400 --> 13:49.640\n of being A players.\n\n13:49.640 --> 13:53.180\n And I think, in order to grade a great team,\n\n13:53.180 --> 13:55.840\n you have to appreciate all the differences\n\n13:55.840 --> 13:59.320\n in ways of being A players, okay?\n\n13:59.320 --> 14:00.520\n That's the first thing.\n\n14:00.520 --> 14:04.720\n And then you always have to be super excellent,\n\n14:04.720 --> 14:07.420\n in my opinion, you always have to be really excellent\n\n14:07.420 --> 14:11.960\n with people to help them understand each other themselves\n\n14:11.960 --> 14:15.960\n and get in sync with them about what's true about them\n\n14:15.960 --> 14:18.080\n and their circumstances and how they're doing,\n\n14:18.080 --> 14:19.800\n so that they're having a fabulous\n\n14:19.800 --> 14:23.080\n personal development experience at the same time\n\n14:23.080 --> 14:24.460\n as you're dealing with them.\n\n14:24.460 --> 14:27.740\n So when I say that they're all different ways,\n\n14:27.740 --> 14:30.600\n this is one of the then qualities,\n\n14:30.600 --> 14:32.480\n you asked me what are the qualities.\n\n14:32.480 --> 14:35.480\n So one of the third qualities that I would say\n\n14:35.480 --> 14:40.480\n is to know how to deal well with your not knowing\n\n14:41.800 --> 14:46.440\n and to be able to get the best expertise\n\n14:46.440 --> 14:50.380\n so that you're a great orchestrator of different ways,\n\n14:50.380 --> 14:53.840\n so that the people who are really, really successful,\n\n14:53.840 --> 14:56.720\n unlike most people believe that they're successful\n\n14:56.720 --> 14:58.480\n because of what they know,\n\n14:58.480 --> 15:01.600\n they're even more successful\n\n15:01.600 --> 15:04.640\n by being able to effectively learn from others\n\n15:04.640 --> 15:06.840\n and tap into the skills of people\n\n15:06.840 --> 15:09.000\n who see things different from them.\n\n15:09.000 --> 15:11.740\n Brilliant, so how do you win that personality\n\n15:11.740 --> 15:13.780\n being first of all, open to the fact\n\n15:13.780 --> 15:18.200\n that there's other people see things differently than you,\n\n15:18.200 --> 15:22.320\n and at the same time have supreme confidence in your vision?\n\n15:22.320 --> 15:24.920\n Is there just the psychology of that?\n\n15:24.920 --> 15:27.300\n Do you see a tension there between the confidence\n\n15:27.300 --> 15:28.560\n and the open mindedness?\n\n15:28.560 --> 15:31.600\n No, it's funny because I think we grow up thinking\n\n15:31.600 --> 15:33.200\n that there's a tension there, right?\n\n15:33.200 --> 15:35.160\n That there's a confidence\n\n15:35.160 --> 15:38.360\n and the more confidence that you have,\n\n15:38.360 --> 15:40.560\n there's a tension with the open mindedness\n\n15:40.560 --> 15:43.620\n and not being sure, okay?\n\n15:43.620 --> 15:45.960\n Confident and accurate\n\n15:45.960 --> 15:50.120\n are almost negatively correlated to many people.\n\n15:50.120 --> 15:53.840\n They're extremely confident and they're often inaccurate.\n\n15:53.840 --> 15:57.360\n And so I think one of the greatest tragedies of people\n\n15:57.360 --> 16:00.220\n is not realizing how those things to go together\n\n16:00.220 --> 16:05.220\n because instead it's really that by saying I know a lot\n\n16:05.640 --> 16:08.620\n and how do I know I'm still not wrong?\n\n16:08.620 --> 16:13.480\n And how do I take that the best thinking available to me\n\n16:13.480 --> 16:16.640\n and then raise my probability of learning?\n\n16:16.640 --> 16:19.560\n All these people think for themselves, okay?\n\n16:19.560 --> 16:21.520\n I mean, meaning they're smart,\n\n16:21.520 --> 16:24.000\n but they take in like vacuum cleaners,\n\n16:24.000 --> 16:26.200\n they take in ideas of others,\n\n16:26.200 --> 16:28.840\n they stress test their ideas with others,\n\n16:28.840 --> 16:31.140\n they assess what comes back to them\n\n16:31.140 --> 16:33.640\n in the form of other thinking\n\n16:33.640 --> 16:36.360\n and they also know what they're not good at\n\n16:36.360 --> 16:38.840\n and what other people who are good at the things\n\n16:38.840 --> 16:39.840\n that they're not good at,\n\n16:39.840 --> 16:41.440\n they know how to get those people\n\n16:41.440 --> 16:43.600\n and be successful all around\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:46.960\n because nobody has enough knowledge in their heads\n\n16:46.960 --> 16:49.600\n and that I think is one of the great differences.\n\n16:49.600 --> 16:53.400\n So the reason my company has been successful\n\n16:53.400 --> 16:55.200\n in terms of this is because of an idea\n\n16:55.200 --> 16:58.000\n meritocratic decision making a process\n\n16:58.000 --> 17:00.920\n by which you can get the best ideas.\n\n17:00.920 --> 17:02.840\n You know, what's an idea meritocracy?\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:05.860\n An idea meritocracy is to get the best ideas\n\n17:05.860 --> 17:07.120\n that are available out there\n\n17:07.120 --> 17:09.820\n and to work together with other people in the team\n\n17:09.820 --> 17:10.840\n to achieve that.\n\n17:10.840 --> 17:12.640\n That's an incredible process that you describe\n\n17:12.640 --> 17:15.400\n in several places to arrive at the truth,\n\n17:15.400 --> 17:18.640\n but I apologize if I'm romanticizing the notion,\n\n17:18.640 --> 17:19.840\n but let me linger on it.\n\n17:20.880 --> 17:23.680\n Just having enough self belief,\n\n17:24.680 --> 17:27.600\n you don't think there's a self delusion there\n\n17:27.600 --> 17:30.040\n that's necessary, especially in the beginning.\n\n17:30.040 --> 17:31.800\n You talk about in the journey,\n\n17:31.800 --> 17:34.640\n maybe the trials or the abyss.\n\n17:34.640 --> 17:39.640\n Do you think there is value to diluting yourself?\n\n17:41.580 --> 17:44.280\n I think what you're calling delusion\n\n17:44.280 --> 17:48.880\n is a bad word for uncertainty, okay?\n\n17:48.880 --> 17:50.720\n So in other words,\n\n17:50.720 --> 17:52.800\n because we keep coming back to the question,\n\n17:52.800 --> 17:55.040\n how would you know and all of those things?\n\n17:55.040 --> 17:58.640\n No, I think that delusion is not gonna help you,\n\n17:58.640 --> 18:01.480\n that you have to find out truth, okay?\n\n18:01.480 --> 18:03.880\n To deal with uncertainty, not saying,\n\n18:03.880 --> 18:05.360\n listen, I have this dream\n\n18:05.360 --> 18:08.120\n and I don't know how I'm going to get that dream.\n\n18:08.120 --> 18:10.160\n I mentioned in my book principles\n\n18:10.160 --> 18:12.920\n and described the process in a more complete way\n\n18:12.920 --> 18:15.060\n than we're gonna be able to go here.\n\n18:15.060 --> 18:19.760\n But what happens is I say, you form your dreams first\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:21.760\n and you can't judge\n\n18:21.760 --> 18:24.600\n whether you're going to achieve those dreams\n\n18:24.600 --> 18:26.880\n because you haven't learned\n\n18:26.880 --> 18:28.680\n the things that you're going to learn\n\n18:28.680 --> 18:31.400\n on the way toward those dreams, okay?\n\n18:31.400 --> 18:33.840\n So that isn't delusion.\n\n18:33.840 --> 18:35.640\n I wouldn't use delusion.\n\n18:35.640 --> 18:38.740\n I think you're overemphasizing the importance\n\n18:38.740 --> 18:41.680\n of knowing whether you're going to succeed or not.\n\n18:41.680 --> 18:43.240\n Get rid of that, okay?\n\n18:43.240 --> 18:45.320\n If you can get rid of that and say,\n\n18:45.320 --> 18:48.380\n okay, no, I can have that dream,\n\n18:48.380 --> 18:52.680\n but I'm so realistic in the notion of finding out.\n\n18:52.680 --> 18:56.440\n I'm curious, I'm a great learner, I'm a great experimenter.\n\n18:56.440 --> 18:58.800\n Along the way, you'll do those experiments\n\n18:58.800 --> 19:00.760\n which will teach you more truths\n\n19:00.760 --> 19:03.200\n and more learning about the reality\n\n19:03.200 --> 19:04.980\n so that you can get your dreams.\n\n19:04.980 --> 19:08.400\n Because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay?\n\n19:08.400 --> 19:10.400\n And you think delusion's helpful.\n\n19:10.400 --> 19:12.240\n No, the delusion isn't.\n\n19:12.240 --> 19:14.520\n Don't confuse delusion with not knowing.\n\n19:14.520 --> 19:18.940\n Yes, but nevertheless, so if we look at the abyss,\n\n19:18.940 --> 19:22.060\n we can look at your own that you describe.\n\n19:22.060 --> 19:24.200\n It's difficult psychologically for people.\n\n19:24.200 --> 19:26.080\n So many people quit.\n\n19:26.080 --> 19:28.960\n Many people choose a path that is more comfortable.\n\n19:32.160 --> 19:34.640\n The heartbreak of that breaks people.\n\n19:34.640 --> 19:36.200\n So if you have the dream\n\n19:36.200 --> 19:38.640\n and there's this cycle of learning, setting a goal,\n\n19:38.640 --> 19:42.200\n and so on, what's your value for the psychology\n\n19:42.200 --> 19:45.440\n of just being broken by these difficult moments?\n\n19:45.440 --> 19:48.380\n Well, that's classically the defining moment.\n\n19:48.380 --> 19:51.720\n It's almost like evolution taking care of,\n\n19:51.720 --> 19:55.440\n okay, now you crash, you're in the abyss.\n\n19:55.440 --> 19:56.960\n Oh my God, that's bad.\n\n19:56.960 --> 19:59.320\n And then the question is, what do you do?\n\n19:59.320 --> 20:01.280\n And it sorts people, okay?\n\n20:01.280 --> 20:04.720\n And some people get off the field\n\n20:04.720 --> 20:07.320\n and they say, oh, I don't like this and so on.\n\n20:07.320 --> 20:12.320\n And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis\n\n20:12.800 --> 20:15.280\n and it changes their approach to learning.\n\n20:16.140 --> 20:19.360\n The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty.\n\n20:19.360 --> 20:23.960\n You should take an audacious dreamer,\n\n20:23.960 --> 20:28.680\n guy who wants to change the world, crash, okay,\n\n20:28.680 --> 20:31.720\n and then come out of that crashing and saying,\n\n20:31.720 --> 20:35.200\n okay, I can be audacious\n\n20:35.200 --> 20:39.680\n and scared that I'm gonna be wrong at the same time.\n\n20:39.680 --> 20:41.000\n And then how do I do that?\n\n20:41.000 --> 20:42.400\n Because that's the key.\n\n20:42.400 --> 20:44.560\n When you don't lose your audaciousness\n\n20:44.560 --> 20:46.880\n and you keep going after your big goal,\n\n20:46.880 --> 20:48.400\n and at the same time you say,\n\n20:48.400 --> 20:50.640\n hey, I'm worried that I'm gonna be wrong,\n\n20:50.640 --> 20:53.780\n you gain your radical open mindedness\n\n20:53.780 --> 20:56.120\n that allows you to take in the things,\n\n20:56.120 --> 20:59.560\n that allows you to go to the next level of being successful.\n\n20:59.560 --> 21:02.580\n So your own process, I mean, you've talked about it before,\n\n21:02.580 --> 21:05.260\n but it would be great if you can describe it\n\n21:05.260 --> 21:06.600\n because our darkest moments\n\n21:06.600 --> 21:07.980\n are perhaps the most interesting.\n\n21:07.980 --> 21:12.980\n So your own with the prediction of another depression.\n\n21:13.120 --> 21:14.480\n Economic depression.\n\n21:14.480 --> 21:17.160\n Yes, I apologize, economic depression.\n\n21:17.160 --> 21:22.160\n Can you talk to what you were feeling, thinking,\n\n21:22.320 --> 21:24.600\n planning, strategizing at those moments?\n\n21:24.600 --> 21:28.820\n Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay?\n\n21:28.820 --> 21:30.840\n Building my little company.\n\n21:30.840 --> 21:34.080\n This is in 1981, 82.\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:36.680\n I had calculated that American banks\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:40.920\n had given a lot more money to, lent a lot more money\n\n21:40.920 --> 21:42.120\n to Latin American countries\n\n21:42.120 --> 21:44.040\n than those countries were gonna pay back,\n\n21:44.040 --> 21:46.720\n and that they would have a debt crisis,\n\n21:46.720 --> 21:49.880\n and that this had sent the economy tumbling,\n\n21:49.880 --> 21:53.520\n and that was an extremely controversial point of view.\n\n21:53.520 --> 21:55.600\n Then it started to happen, and it happened,\n\n21:55.600 --> 21:58.800\n and Mexico defaulted in August 1982.\n\n21:58.800 --> 22:02.440\n I thought that there was gonna be an economic collapse\n\n22:02.440 --> 22:03.360\n that was gonna follow\n\n22:03.360 --> 22:05.640\n because there was a series of the other countries,\n\n22:05.640 --> 22:08.160\n it was just playing out as I had imagined,\n\n22:08.160 --> 22:11.000\n and that couldn't have been more wrong.\n\n22:11.000 --> 22:14.080\n That was the exact bottom in the stock market\n\n22:14.080 --> 22:17.440\n because central banks eased monetary policy, blah, blah, blah,\n\n22:17.440 --> 22:19.120\n and I couldn't have been more wrong,\n\n22:19.120 --> 22:21.940\n and I was very publicly wrong and all of that,\n\n22:21.940 --> 22:24.840\n and I lost money for me, and I lost money for my clients,\n\n22:24.840 --> 22:27.880\n and I only had a small company then,\n\n22:27.880 --> 22:32.080\n but these were close people, I had to let them go.\n\n22:32.080 --> 22:35.680\n I was down to me as the last person.\n\n22:35.680 --> 22:39.960\n I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad\n\n22:39.960 --> 22:43.120\n to help to pay for my family bills, very painful,\n\n22:43.120 --> 22:46.960\n and at the same time, I would say it definitely\n\n22:46.960 --> 22:50.460\n was one of the best things that ever happened to me,\n\n22:50.460 --> 22:52.320\n maybe the best thing from happened to me,\n\n22:52.320 --> 22:55.060\n because it changed my approach to decision making.\n\n22:55.060 --> 22:56.360\n It's what I'm saying.\n\n22:56.360 --> 22:58.960\n In other words, I kept saying, okay,\n\n22:58.960 --> 23:01.000\n how do I know whether I'm right?\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:02.840\n How do I know I'm not wrong?\n\n23:02.840 --> 23:07.480\n It gave me that, and it didn't give up my audaciousness\n\n23:07.480 --> 23:10.680\n because I was in a position, what am I gonna do?\n\n23:10.680 --> 23:13.280\n Am I gonna go back, put on a tie,\n\n23:13.280 --> 23:16.520\n go to Wall Street and just do those things?\n\n23:16.520 --> 23:19.600\n No, I can't bring myself to do that, so I'm at a juncture.\n\n23:19.600 --> 23:22.000\n How do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that?\n\n23:22.000 --> 23:25.200\n And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties,\n\n23:25.200 --> 23:28.760\n and that taught me, for example, a number of techniques.\n\n23:28.760 --> 23:31.740\n First, to find the smartest people I could find\n\n23:31.740 --> 23:35.200\n who disagreed with me and to have quality disagreement.\n\n23:35.200 --> 23:37.420\n I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement.\n\n23:37.420 --> 23:39.680\n I learned how to produce diversification.\n\n23:39.680 --> 23:41.800\n I learned how to do a number of things.\n\n23:41.800 --> 23:46.080\n That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy.\n\n23:46.080 --> 23:48.440\n In other words, person by person, I hired them,\n\n23:48.440 --> 23:50.320\n and I wanted the smartest people\n\n23:50.320 --> 23:51.760\n who would be independent thinkers\n\n23:51.760 --> 23:55.000\n who would disagree with each other and me well\n\n23:55.000 --> 23:57.560\n so that we could be independent thinkers\n\n23:57.560 --> 24:00.200\n to go off to produce those audacious dreams\n\n24:00.200 --> 24:02.480\n because you have to be an independent thinker to do that,\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:05.480\n and to do that independently of the consensus,\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:06.920\n independently of each other,\n\n24:06.920 --> 24:08.800\n and then work ourselves through that\n\n24:08.800 --> 24:11.400\n because who know whether you're gonna have the right answer?\n\n24:11.400 --> 24:15.720\n And by doing that, then that was the key to our success.\n\n24:15.720 --> 24:18.240\n And the things that I wanna pass along to people,\n\n24:18.240 --> 24:20.860\n the reason I'm doing this podcast with you\n\n24:20.860 --> 24:23.160\n is I'm 70 years old,\n\n24:23.160 --> 24:28.000\n and that is a magical way of achieving success.\n\n24:28.000 --> 24:30.920\n If you can create an idea meritocracy,\n\n24:30.920 --> 24:34.040\n it's so much better in terms of achieving success\n\n24:34.040 --> 24:36.640\n and also quality relationships with people,\n\n24:36.640 --> 24:38.920\n but that's what that experience gave me.\n\n24:38.920 --> 24:41.560\n So if we can linger on a little bit longer,\n\n24:41.560 --> 24:44.880\n the idea of an idea meritocracy, it's fascinating,\n\n24:44.880 --> 24:48.020\n but especially because it seems to be rare,\n\n24:48.020 --> 24:50.920\n not just in companies, but in society.\n\n24:50.920 --> 24:54.280\n So there is a lot of people on Twitter and public discourse\n\n24:54.280 --> 24:56.960\n and politics and so on that are really stuck\n\n24:56.960 --> 24:59.900\n in certain sets of ideas, whatever they are.\n\n24:59.900 --> 25:03.420\n So when you're confronted with an idea\n\n25:03.420 --> 25:08.420\n that's different than your own about a particular topic,\n\n25:09.040 --> 25:12.720\n what kind of process do you go through mentally?\n\n25:12.720 --> 25:16.040\n Are you arguing through the idea with the person,\n\n25:16.040 --> 25:18.320\n sort of present is almost like a debate,\n\n25:18.320 --> 25:20.980\n or do you sit on it and consider the world\n\n25:20.980 --> 25:22.680\n sort of empathetically?\n\n25:22.680 --> 25:27.280\n If this is true, then what does that world look like?\n\n25:27.280 --> 25:28.800\n Does that world make sense and so on?\n\n25:28.800 --> 25:30.480\n So what's the process of considering\n\n25:30.480 --> 25:32.840\n those conflicting ideas for you?\n\n25:32.840 --> 25:35.200\n I'm gonna answer that question,\n\n25:35.200 --> 25:39.120\n but after saying first, almost implicit in your question\n\n25:39.120 --> 25:42.420\n is it's not common, okay?\n\n25:42.420 --> 25:47.040\n What's common produces only common results, okay?\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:50.080\n So don't judge anything that is good\n\n25:50.080 --> 25:51.600\n based on whether it's common,\n\n25:51.600 --> 25:53.560\n because it's only gonna give you common results.\n\n25:53.560 --> 25:57.160\n If you want unique, you have a unique approach, okay?\n\n25:57.160 --> 26:00.440\n And so that art of thoughtful disagreement\n\n26:00.440 --> 26:05.120\n is the capacity to hold two things in your mind\n\n26:05.120 --> 26:06.560\n at the same time.\n\n26:06.560 --> 26:09.700\n The, gee, I think this makes sense,\n\n26:09.700 --> 26:13.360\n and then saying, I'm not sure it makes sense,\n\n26:13.360 --> 26:17.560\n and then try to say, why does it make sense?\n\n26:17.560 --> 26:20.160\n And then to triangulate with others.\n\n26:20.160 --> 26:22.460\n So if I'm having a discussion like that\n\n26:22.460 --> 26:26.560\n and I work myself through and I'm not sure,\n\n26:26.560 --> 26:29.240\n then I have to do that in a good way.\n\n26:29.240 --> 26:32.200\n So I always give attention, for example,\n\n26:32.200 --> 26:34.360\n let's start off, what does the other person know\n\n26:34.360 --> 26:36.120\n relative to what I know?\n\n26:36.120 --> 26:39.840\n So if a person has a higher expertise or things,\n\n26:39.840 --> 26:42.240\n I'm much more inclined to ask questions.\n\n26:42.240 --> 26:43.840\n I'm always asking questions.\n\n26:43.840 --> 26:46.640\n If you wanna learn, you're asking questions,\n\n26:46.640 --> 26:48.480\n you're not arguing, okay?\n\n26:48.480 --> 26:51.840\n You're taking in, you're assessing when it comes into you.\n\n26:51.840 --> 26:53.000\n Does that make sense?\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:54.080\n Are you learning something?\n\n26:54.080 --> 26:56.000\n Are you getting epiphanies and so on?\n\n26:56.000 --> 27:00.160\n And I try to then do that if the conversation,\n\n27:00.160 --> 27:02.800\n as we're trying to decide what is true,\n\n27:02.800 --> 27:04.560\n and we're trying to do that together,\n\n27:04.560 --> 27:06.200\n and we see truth different,\n\n27:06.200 --> 27:10.320\n then I might even call in another really smart,\n\n27:10.320 --> 27:13.280\n capable person and try to say, what is true\n\n27:13.280 --> 27:15.400\n and how do we explore that together?\n\n27:15.400 --> 27:17.640\n And you go through that same thing.\n\n27:17.640 --> 27:22.600\n So I would, I said, I describe it as having open mindedness\n\n27:22.600 --> 27:25.000\n and assertiveness at the same time,\n\n27:25.000 --> 27:28.560\n that you can simultaneously be open minded\n\n27:28.560 --> 27:30.920\n and take in with that curiosity\n\n27:30.920 --> 27:32.600\n and then also be assertive and say,\n\n27:32.600 --> 27:33.840\n but that doesn't make sense.\n\n27:33.840 --> 27:35.640\n Why would this be the case?\n\n27:35.640 --> 27:37.440\n And you do that back and forth.\n\n27:39.040 --> 27:41.520\n And when you're doing that kind of back and forth\n\n27:41.520 --> 27:44.800\n on a topic like the economy, which you have,\n\n27:44.800 --> 27:46.640\n to me, perhaps I'm naive,\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:51.160\n but it seems both incredible and incredibly complex,\n\n27:51.160 --> 27:54.680\n the economy, the trading, the transactions,\n\n27:54.680 --> 27:57.720\n that these transactions between two individuals\n\n27:57.720 --> 28:00.320\n somehow add up to this giant mechanism.\n\n28:00.320 --> 28:03.400\n You've put out a 30 minute video.\n\n28:03.400 --> 28:06.520\n You have a lot of incredible videos online\n\n28:06.520 --> 28:10.080\n that people should definitely watch on YouTube,\n\n28:10.080 --> 28:11.680\n but you've put out this 30 minute video\n\n28:11.680 --> 28:14.640\n titled How the Economic Machine Works.\n\n28:14.640 --> 28:19.120\n That is probably one of the best, if not the best video\n\n28:19.120 --> 28:22.400\n I've seen on the internet in terms of educational videos.\n\n28:22.400 --> 28:24.280\n So people should definitely watch it,\n\n28:24.280 --> 28:29.280\n especially because it's not that the individual components\n\n28:29.280 --> 28:31.940\n of the video are somehow revolutionary,\n\n28:31.940 --> 28:33.600\n but the simplicity and the clarity\n\n28:33.600 --> 28:36.200\n of the different components just makes you,\n\n28:36.200 --> 28:37.760\n there's a few light bulb moments there\n\n28:37.760 --> 28:40.880\n about how the economy works as a machine.\n\n28:40.880 --> 28:43.160\n So as you described, there's three main forces\n\n28:43.160 --> 28:45.200\n that drive the economy, productivity growth,\n\n28:45.200 --> 28:48.340\n short term debt cycle, long term debt cycle.\n\n28:48.340 --> 28:52.300\n The former, productivity growth is how valuable things,\n\n28:52.300 --> 28:56.180\n how much value people create,\n\n28:56.180 --> 28:57.420\n valuable things people create.\n\n28:57.420 --> 29:02.100\n The latter is people borrowing from their future selves\n\n29:02.100 --> 29:05.220\n to hopefully create those valuable things faster.\n\n29:05.220 --> 29:07.420\n So this is an incredible system to me.\n\n29:07.420 --> 29:09.980\n Maybe we can linger on it a little bit,\n\n29:09.980 --> 29:14.180\n but you've also said what most people think about\n\n29:14.180 --> 29:15.700\n as money is actually credit.\n\n29:15.700 --> 29:20.580\n Total amount of credit in the US is $50 trillion.\n\n29:20.580 --> 29:23.180\n Total amount of money is $3 trillion.\n\n29:24.100 --> 29:26.060\n That's just crazy to me.\n\n29:26.060 --> 29:28.540\n Maybe I'm silly, maybe you can educate me,\n\n29:28.540 --> 29:29.920\n but that seems crazy.\n\n29:30.980 --> 29:33.460\n It gives me just positive human civilization\n\n29:33.460 --> 29:37.140\n has been able to create a system that has so much credit.\n\n29:37.140 --> 29:40.900\n So that's a long way to ask,\n\n29:40.900 --> 29:45.060\n do you think credit is good or bad for society?\n\n29:45.060 --> 29:49.180\n That system of that's so fundamentally based on credit.\n\n29:49.180 --> 29:51.300\n I think credit is great,\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:54.580\n even though people often overdo it.\n\n29:54.580 --> 29:58.940\n Credit is that somebody has earned money.\n\n29:58.940 --> 30:03.940\n And what happens is they lend it to somebody else\n\n30:04.820 --> 30:07.020\n who's got better ideas and they cut a deal.\n\n30:07.020 --> 30:09.500\n And then that person with the better ideas\n\n30:09.500 --> 30:10.540\n is gonna pay it back.\n\n30:10.540 --> 30:11.980\n And if it works well,\n\n30:11.980 --> 30:15.680\n it helps resource allocations go well,\n\n30:15.680 --> 30:18.340\n providing people like the entrepreneurs\n\n30:18.340 --> 30:20.500\n and all of those, they need capital.\n\n30:20.500 --> 30:22.180\n They don't have capital themselves.\n\n30:22.180 --> 30:24.020\n And so somebody is gonna give them capital\n\n30:24.020 --> 30:26.580\n and they'll give them credit along those lines.\n\n30:26.580 --> 30:30.180\n Then what happens is it's not managed well\n\n30:30.180 --> 30:31.860\n in a variety of ways.\n\n30:31.860 --> 30:34.460\n So I did another book on principles,\n\n30:34.460 --> 30:38.660\n principles of big debt crises that go into that.\n\n30:38.660 --> 30:39.660\n And it's free, by the way,\n\n30:39.660 --> 30:43.880\n I put it free online as a PDF.\n\n30:43.880 --> 30:47.060\n So if you go online and you look principles\n\n30:47.060 --> 30:48.900\n of a big debt crisis is under my name,\n\n30:48.900 --> 30:50.660\n you can download it in a PDF\n\n30:50.660 --> 30:52.900\n or you can buy a print book of it.\n\n30:52.900 --> 30:55.780\n And it goes through that particular process.\n\n30:55.780 --> 31:00.780\n And so you always have it overdone in always the same way.\n\n31:01.500 --> 31:03.100\n Everything, by the way,\n\n31:03.100 --> 31:04.960\n almost everything happens over and over again\n\n31:04.960 --> 31:07.080\n for the same reasons, okay?\n\n31:07.080 --> 31:09.700\n So these debt crisis is all happened over and over again\n\n31:09.700 --> 31:11.100\n for the same reasons.\n\n31:11.100 --> 31:12.580\n They get it overdone.\n\n31:12.580 --> 31:14.400\n In the book, it explains how you identify\n\n31:14.400 --> 31:16.100\n whether it's overdone or not.\n\n31:16.100 --> 31:17.500\n They get it overdone.\n\n31:17.500 --> 31:19.280\n And then you go through the process\n\n31:19.280 --> 31:21.580\n of making the adjustments according that\n\n31:21.580 --> 31:25.340\n and it explains how they can use the levers and so on.\n\n31:25.340 --> 31:27.220\n If you didn't have credit,\n\n31:27.220 --> 31:30.860\n then you would be sort of everybody sort of be stuck.\n\n31:30.860 --> 31:35.340\n So credit is a good thing,\n\n31:35.340 --> 31:37.220\n but it can easily be overdone.\n\n31:37.220 --> 31:39.800\n So now we get into the, what is money?\n\n31:39.800 --> 31:41.020\n What is credit?\n\n31:41.020 --> 31:43.260\n Okay, you get into money and credit.\n\n31:43.260 --> 31:46.540\n So if you're holding credit and you think that's worthwhile,\n\n31:46.540 --> 31:48.780\n keep in mind that the central bank,\n\n31:48.780 --> 31:50.480\n let's say it can print the money.\n\n31:50.480 --> 31:51.980\n What is that problem?\n\n31:51.980 --> 31:55.020\n You have an IOU and the IOU says\n\n31:55.020 --> 31:58.020\n you're gonna get a certain number of dollars, let's say,\n\n31:58.020 --> 32:00.220\n or yen or euros.\n\n32:00.220 --> 32:02.660\n And that is what the IOU is.\n\n32:02.660 --> 32:05.860\n And so the question is, will you get that money\n\n32:05.860 --> 32:07.860\n and what will it be worth?\n\n32:07.860 --> 32:10.500\n And then also you have a government,\n\n32:10.500 --> 32:13.020\n which is a participant in that process\n\n32:13.020 --> 32:16.380\n because they are on the hook, they owe money.\n\n32:16.380 --> 32:18.540\n And then will they print the money\n\n32:18.540 --> 32:20.940\n to make it easy for everybody to pay?\n\n32:20.940 --> 32:23.140\n So you have to pay attention to those two.\n\n32:23.140 --> 32:26.400\n I would suggest like you recommend to other people,\n\n32:26.400 --> 32:28.940\n just take that 30 minutes\n\n32:28.940 --> 32:31.540\n and it comes across pretty clearly.\n\n32:31.540 --> 32:35.140\n But my conclusion is that of course you want it.\n\n32:35.140 --> 32:39.860\n And even if you understand it and the cycles well,\n\n32:39.860 --> 32:42.180\n you can benefit from those cycles\n\n32:42.180 --> 32:45.360\n rather than to be hurt by those cycles.\n\n32:45.360 --> 32:48.620\n Because I don't know the way the cycle works\n\n32:48.620 --> 32:50.420\n is somebody gets over indebted,\n\n32:50.420 --> 32:52.300\n they have to sell an asset.\n\n32:52.300 --> 32:53.580\n Okay, then I don't know,\n\n32:53.580 --> 32:55.700\n that's when assets become cheaper.\n\n32:55.700 --> 32:57.380\n How do you acquire the asset?\n\n32:57.380 --> 32:59.240\n It's a whole process.\n\n32:59.240 --> 33:03.820\n So again, maybe another dumb question, but...\n\n33:03.820 --> 33:05.980\n There are no such things as dumb questions.\n\n33:05.980 --> 33:06.820\n There you go.\n\n33:06.820 --> 33:07.920\n But what is money?\n\n33:07.920 --> 33:12.060\n So you've mentioned credit and money.\n\n33:13.200 --> 33:16.440\n Another thing that if I just zoom out\n\n33:16.440 --> 33:19.400\n from an alien perspective and look at human civilization,\n\n33:19.400 --> 33:22.720\n it's incredible that we've created a thing\n\n33:22.720 --> 33:27.380\n that only works because currency,\n\n33:27.380 --> 33:30.480\n because we all agree it has value.\n\n33:31.360 --> 33:36.360\n So I guess my question is how do you think about money\n\n33:36.360 --> 33:38.920\n as this emergent phenomenon?\n\n33:38.920 --> 33:41.720\n And what do you think is the future of money?\n\n33:41.720 --> 33:44.480\n You've commented on Bitcoin, other forms.\n\n33:44.480 --> 33:48.600\n What do you think is its history and future?\n\n33:48.600 --> 33:51.340\n How do you think about money?\n\n33:51.340 --> 33:55.100\n There are two things that money is for.\n\n33:55.100 --> 33:59.820\n It's a medium of exchange and it's a storehold of wealth.\n\n33:59.820 --> 34:00.660\n Yes.\n\n34:00.660 --> 34:05.660\n So money, so you could say something's a medium of exchange,\n\n34:06.800 --> 34:09.400\n and then you could say, is it a storehold of wealth?\n\n34:11.280 --> 34:16.280\n And money is that vehicle that is those things\n\n34:17.000 --> 34:20.840\n and can be used to pay off your debt.\n\n34:20.840 --> 34:25.040\n So when you have a debt and you provide it,\n\n34:25.040 --> 34:26.880\n it pays off your debt.\n\n34:26.880 --> 34:28.760\n So that's that process.\n\n34:28.760 --> 34:31.200\n And it's, I apologize to interrupt,\n\n34:31.200 --> 34:35.080\n but it only can be a medium of exchange or store wealth\n\n34:35.080 --> 34:37.680\n when everybody recognizes it to be of value.\n\n34:37.680 --> 34:38.640\n That's right.\n\n34:38.640 --> 34:41.400\n And so you see in the history around the world\n\n34:41.400 --> 34:46.400\n and you go to places, I was in an island in the Pacific\n\n34:48.320 --> 34:53.320\n in which they had as money these big stones.\n\n34:53.660 --> 34:56.760\n And literally, they were taking a boat,\n\n34:56.760 --> 34:59.320\n this big carved stone,\n\n34:59.320 --> 35:01.560\n and they were taking it from one of the islands to the other\n\n35:01.560 --> 35:06.560\n and it sank, the piece of this big stone,\n\n35:06.880 --> 35:10.120\n piece of money that they had, and it went to the bottom\n\n35:10.120 --> 35:13.560\n and they still perceived it as having value\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:15.960\n so that it was, even though it was in the bottom\n\n35:15.960 --> 35:17.820\n and it's this big hunk of rock,\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:19.280\n the fact that somebody owned it,\n\n35:19.280 --> 35:21.920\n they would say, oh, I'll own it for this and that.\n\n35:21.920 --> 35:25.480\n I've seen beads in different places,\n\n35:25.480 --> 35:28.880\n shells converted to this and mediums of exchange.\n\n35:28.880 --> 35:32.480\n And when we look at what we've got, you're exactly right.\n\n35:32.480 --> 35:35.120\n It is the notion that if I give it to you,\n\n35:35.120 --> 35:37.960\n I can then take it and I can buy something with it.\n\n35:37.960 --> 35:40.700\n And that's, so it's a matter of perception.\n\n35:40.700 --> 35:41.540\n Okay.\n\n35:41.540 --> 35:44.880\n And then we go through then the history of money\n\n35:44.880 --> 35:47.520\n and the vulnerabilities of money.\n\n35:47.520 --> 35:50.840\n And what we have is there's, through history,\n\n35:50.840 --> 35:52.880\n there's been two types of money.\n\n35:52.880 --> 35:57.880\n Those that are claims on something of value,\n\n35:58.200 --> 36:01.680\n like the connection to gold or something.\n\n36:01.680 --> 36:02.520\n That's right.\n\n36:02.520 --> 36:03.520\n That would be.\n\n36:03.520 --> 36:07.480\n Or they just are money without any connection,\n\n36:07.480 --> 36:08.840\n and then we have a system now,\n\n36:08.840 --> 36:10.940\n which is a fiat monetary system.\n\n36:10.940 --> 36:12.680\n So that's what money is.\n\n36:12.680 --> 36:17.680\n Then it will last as long as it's kept a value\n\n36:17.840 --> 36:19.140\n and it works that way.\n\n36:19.140 --> 36:23.780\n So let's say central banks, when they get in the position\n\n36:23.780 --> 36:26.220\n of like they owe a lot of money,\n\n36:26.220 --> 36:29.780\n like we have in the case, it's increasingly the case,\n\n36:29.780 --> 36:33.700\n and they also in our mind and they have the printing press\n\n36:33.700 --> 36:36.700\n to print the money and get out of that.\n\n36:36.700 --> 36:39.480\n And you have a lot of people might be in that position.\n\n36:39.480 --> 36:43.420\n Then you can print it and then it could be devalued in there.\n\n36:43.420 --> 36:46.860\n And so history has shown, forget about today,\n\n36:46.860 --> 36:49.840\n history has shown that no currency,\n\n36:52.180 --> 36:56.380\n every currency has either ended as being a currency\n\n36:56.380 --> 36:59.900\n or devalued as a currency over periods of time,\n\n36:59.900 --> 37:01.420\n long periods of time.\n\n37:01.420 --> 37:03.540\n So it evolves and it changes,\n\n37:03.540 --> 37:06.300\n but everybody needs that medium of exchange\n\n37:06.300 --> 37:08.780\n and everybody needs that storehold of wealth.\n\n37:08.780 --> 37:12.360\n So it keeps changing what is money over a period of time.\n\n37:12.360 --> 37:17.360\n But so much is being digitized today and there's this ideas\n\n37:18.820 --> 37:22.580\n that are based on the blockchain of Bitcoin and so on.\n\n37:22.580 --> 37:27.580\n So if all currencies, like all empires come to an end,\n\n37:27.660 --> 37:30.060\n what do you think, well, do you think something\n\n37:30.060 --> 37:34.340\n like Bitcoin might emerge as a common store of value,\n\n37:34.340 --> 37:37.860\n a store of wealth and a medium of exchange?\n\n37:37.860 --> 37:42.860\n The problem with Bitcoin is that it's not\n\n37:43.660 --> 37:44.920\n an effective medium of exchange.\n\n37:44.920 --> 37:47.460\n Like it's not easy for me to go in there\n\n37:47.460 --> 37:49.100\n and buy things with it.\n\n37:49.100 --> 37:52.060\n And then it's not an effective storehold of value\n\n37:52.060 --> 37:56.020\n because it has a volatility that's based on speculation\n\n37:56.020 --> 38:00.020\n and the like, so it's not a very effective saving.\n\n38:00.020 --> 38:03.500\n That's very different from Facebook's\n\n38:03.500 --> 38:05.620\n of a stable value currency,\n\n38:05.620 --> 38:09.100\n which would be effective as both a medium of exchange\n\n38:09.100 --> 38:11.140\n and a storehold of wealth.\n\n38:11.140 --> 38:12.860\n Because if you were to hold it\n\n38:12.860 --> 38:15.700\n and the way it's linked to number of things\n\n38:15.700 --> 38:17.460\n that it's linked to would mean\n\n38:17.460 --> 38:20.780\n that it could be a very effective storehold of wealth.\n\n38:20.780 --> 38:22.480\n And then you have a digital currency\n\n38:22.480 --> 38:24.980\n that could be a very effective medium exchange\n\n38:24.980 --> 38:26.780\n and storehold of wealth.\n\n38:26.780 --> 38:29.940\n So in my opinion, some digital currencies\n\n38:29.940 --> 38:32.800\n are likely to succeed more or less\n\n38:32.800 --> 38:35.060\n based on that ability to do it.\n\n38:35.060 --> 38:37.940\n Then the question is what happens?\n\n38:37.940 --> 38:40.740\n Okay, what happens is do central banks\n\n38:40.740 --> 38:42.640\n allow that to happen?\n\n38:42.640 --> 38:44.860\n I really do believe it's possible\n\n38:44.860 --> 38:47.060\n to get a better form of money\n\n38:47.060 --> 38:49.760\n that central banks don't control.\n\n38:49.760 --> 38:51.980\n Okay, a better force of money\n\n38:51.980 --> 38:54.540\n that the central banks don't control.\n\n38:54.540 --> 38:57.820\n But then that's not yet happened.\n\n38:57.820 --> 38:59.660\n And we also have to,\n\n38:59.660 --> 39:03.460\n and so they've got to go through that evolutionary process.\n\n39:03.460 --> 39:05.700\n In order to go through that evolutionary process,\n\n39:05.700 --> 39:09.140\n first of all, governments have got to allow that to happen,\n\n39:09.140 --> 39:11.520\n which is to some extent a threat to them\n\n39:11.520 --> 39:13.100\n in terms of their power.\n\n39:13.100 --> 39:14.620\n And that's an issue.\n\n39:14.620 --> 39:17.540\n And then you have to also build the confidence\n\n39:17.540 --> 39:20.500\n in all of the components of it\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:23.580\n to say, okay, that's going to be effective\n\n39:23.580 --> 39:28.580\n because I won't have problems owning it.\n\n39:28.580 --> 39:30.940\n So I think that digital currencies\n\n39:30.940 --> 39:35.200\n have some element of potential,\n\n39:35.200 --> 39:37.700\n but there's a lot of hurdles\n\n39:37.700 --> 39:39.860\n that are going to have to be gotten over.\n\n39:39.860 --> 39:42.820\n I think that it'll be a very long time,\n\n39:42.820 --> 39:46.140\n possibly never, but anyway, a very long time\n\n39:46.140 --> 39:47.960\n before we have that, let's say,\n\n39:47.960 --> 39:49.860\n get into a position that would be\n\n39:51.860 --> 39:55.120\n effective means relative to gold, let's say,\n\n39:55.120 --> 39:56.300\n if you were to think of that.\n\n39:56.300 --> 40:00.740\n Because gold has a track record of thousands of years.\n\n40:00.740 --> 40:04.820\n All across countries, it has its mobility,\n\n40:04.820 --> 40:06.500\n it has the ability to put it down,\n\n40:06.500 --> 40:07.580\n it has certain abilities.\n\n40:07.580 --> 40:12.140\n It's got disadvantages relative to digital currencies,\n\n40:12.140 --> 40:14.100\n but central banks will hold it.\n\n40:14.100 --> 40:18.420\n Like there's central banks that worry about others,\n\n40:18.420 --> 40:20.220\n other countries, central banks might worry\n\n40:20.220 --> 40:23.020\n about whether the U.S. dollar is going to print or not.\n\n40:23.020 --> 40:24.860\n And so the thing they're going to go to\n\n40:24.860 --> 40:26.980\n is not going to be the digital currency.\n\n40:26.980 --> 40:30.740\n The thing they're going to go to is gold or something else,\n\n40:30.740 --> 40:32.780\n some other currency, they got to pick it.\n\n40:32.780 --> 40:35.380\n And so I think it's a long way to go.\n\n40:35.380 --> 40:37.260\n Well, you think it's possible that one day\n\n40:37.260 --> 40:39.140\n we don't even have a central bank\n\n40:39.140 --> 40:42.940\n because of a currency that doesn't,\n\n40:42.940 --> 40:46.300\n that cannot be controlled by the central bank\n\n40:46.300 --> 40:47.940\n is the primary currency?\n\n40:49.000 --> 40:50.700\n Or does that seem very unlikely?\n\n40:50.700 --> 40:55.700\n It would be very remote possibility\n\n40:57.960 --> 41:00.440\n or very long in the future.\n\n41:00.440 --> 41:01.480\n Got it.\n\n41:01.480 --> 41:04.240\n Again, maybe a dumb question, but romanticize one.\n\n41:04.240 --> 41:06.080\n When you sit back and you look,\n\n41:06.080 --> 41:09.840\n you describe these transactions between individuals,\n\n41:09.840 --> 41:13.940\n somehow creating short term debt cycles,\n\n41:13.940 --> 41:17.520\n long term debt cycles, there's productivity growth.\n\n41:17.520 --> 41:22.400\n Does it amaze you that this whole thing works?\n\n41:22.400 --> 41:25.360\n That there's however many million,\n\n41:25.360 --> 41:27.800\n hundreds of millions of people in the United States,\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:30.200\n globally over seven billion people,\n\n41:30.200 --> 41:33.100\n that this thing between individual transactions,\n\n41:34.200 --> 41:36.200\n it just, it works.\n\n41:36.200 --> 41:37.080\n Yeah.\n\n41:37.080 --> 41:38.480\n It amazes me.\n\n41:38.480 --> 41:43.400\n Like I go back and forth between being in it\n\n41:43.400 --> 41:48.000\n and then I think, like, how did a credit card,\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:49.600\n how is that really possible?\n\n41:49.600 --> 41:52.520\n I'm still used, I look up credit card, I put it on,\n\n41:52.520 --> 41:53.880\n the guy doesn't know me.\n\n41:53.880 --> 41:54.720\n Yeah.\n\n41:54.720 --> 41:57.100\n It's all strangers. It signs, okay.\n\n41:57.100 --> 41:58.660\n We're making the digital entries.\n\n41:58.660 --> 42:01.080\n Is that really secure enough and that kind of thing?\n\n42:01.080 --> 42:04.280\n And then it goes back and it goes this and it clears\n\n42:04.280 --> 42:05.520\n and it all happens.\n\n42:05.520 --> 42:09.680\n And what I marvel at that and those types of things\n\n42:09.680 --> 42:14.240\n is because of the capacity of the human mind\n\n42:14.240 --> 42:19.000\n to create abstractions that are true.\n\n42:19.000 --> 42:23.400\n It's imagination and then the ability to go from one level\n\n42:23.400 --> 42:25.680\n and then if these things are true,\n\n42:25.680 --> 42:28.880\n then you go to the next level and if those things are true,\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:30.200\n then you go to the next level.\n\n42:30.200 --> 42:33.700\n And all those miracles that we almost become common,\n\n42:33.700 --> 42:36.440\n it's like when I'm flying in a plane\n\n42:36.440 --> 42:39.520\n or when I'm looking at all of the things that happen.\n\n42:39.520 --> 42:42.600\n When I get communications in the middle of,\n\n42:42.600 --> 42:45.040\n I don't know, Africa or Antarctica\n\n42:45.040 --> 42:48.720\n and we're communicating in the ways where I see the face\n\n42:48.720 --> 42:52.560\n on my iPad of somebody, my grandkid and someplace else\n\n42:52.560 --> 42:57.560\n and I look at this and I say, wow, yes, it all amazes me.\n\n42:58.080 --> 43:01.620\n So while being amazing, do you have a sense,\n\n43:01.620 --> 43:02.920\n the principles you described,\n\n43:02.920 --> 43:06.120\n that the whole thing is stable somehow also?\n\n43:06.120 --> 43:08.440\n Or is this, are we just lucky?\n\n43:08.440 --> 43:11.600\n So the principles that you described,\n\n43:11.600 --> 43:16.600\n are those describing a system that is stable, robust\n\n43:16.880 --> 43:18.560\n and will remain so?\n\n43:18.560 --> 43:22.920\n Or is it a lucky accident of our early history?\n\n43:22.920 --> 43:26.000\n My area of expertise is economics and markets\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:28.840\n so I get down to like a real nitty gritty.\n\n43:28.840 --> 43:30.280\n I can't tell you whether the plane\n\n43:30.280 --> 43:32.280\n is gonna fall out of the sky\n\n43:32.280 --> 43:34.960\n because of its particular fundamentals.\n\n43:34.960 --> 43:36.380\n I don't know enough about that\n\n43:36.380 --> 43:37.960\n but it happens over and over again\n\n43:37.960 --> 43:39.760\n and so on, it gives me faith, okay?\n\n43:39.760 --> 43:41.300\n So without me knowing it.\n\n43:41.300 --> 43:43.800\n In the markets and the economy,\n\n43:43.800 --> 43:47.440\n I know those things well enough, in a sense,\n\n43:47.440 --> 43:52.440\n to say that by and large, that structure is right,\n\n43:53.600 --> 43:55.120\n what we're seeing is right.\n\n43:55.120 --> 43:58.060\n Now, whether there are disruptions\n\n43:58.060 --> 44:01.200\n and it has effects that can come,\n\n44:01.200 --> 44:03.200\n not because that structure is right,\n\n44:03.200 --> 44:04.600\n and I believe it's right,\n\n44:04.600 --> 44:09.600\n but whether it can be hurt by let's say connectivity\n\n44:09.640 --> 44:11.200\n or journal entries,\n\n44:11.200 --> 44:13.480\n they could take all the money away from you\n\n44:13.480 --> 44:15.360\n through your digital entries.\n\n44:15.360 --> 44:19.120\n There's all sorts of things that can happen in various ways\n\n44:19.120 --> 44:23.620\n that means that that money is worthless or the system falls\n\n44:23.620 --> 44:26.840\n but from what I see in terms of its basic structure\n\n44:26.840 --> 44:30.200\n and those complexities that still take my breath away,\n\n44:30.200 --> 44:33.560\n I would say knowing enough about the mechanics of them,\n\n44:33.560 --> 44:34.840\n that doesn't worry me.\n\n44:34.840 --> 44:37.040\n Have you seen disruptions in your lifetime\n\n44:37.040 --> 44:38.240\n that really surprised you?\n\n44:38.240 --> 44:39.800\n Major disruptions? Oh, all the time.\n\n44:39.800 --> 44:42.200\n This is one of the great lessons of my life\n\n44:42.200 --> 44:46.520\n is that many times I've seen things\n\n44:46.520 --> 44:50.460\n that I was very surprised about\n\n44:50.460 --> 44:54.920\n and that I realized almost all of those\n\n44:54.920 --> 44:57.600\n I was surprised about because they just,\n\n44:57.600 --> 45:00.240\n they were just the first time it happened to me,\n\n45:00.240 --> 45:02.620\n they didn't happen in my lifetime before\n\n45:02.620 --> 45:04.660\n but when I researched them,\n\n45:04.660 --> 45:08.240\n they happened in other places or other people lifetimes.\n\n45:08.240 --> 45:13.240\n So for example, I remember 1971, the dollar,\n\n45:13.520 --> 45:16.720\n there was no such thing as a devaluation of a currency,\n\n45:16.720 --> 45:18.520\n it didn't experience it\n\n45:18.520 --> 45:21.120\n and the dollar was connected to gold\n\n45:21.120 --> 45:23.160\n and I was watching events happen\n\n45:23.160 --> 45:26.520\n and then you get on and that definition of money\n\n45:26.520 --> 45:29.060\n all of a sudden went out the window\n\n45:29.060 --> 45:31.340\n because it was not tied to gold\n\n45:31.340 --> 45:34.200\n and then you have this devaluation.\n\n45:34.200 --> 45:38.720\n So and then, or the first oil shock or the second oil shock\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:41.840\n or so many of these things.\n\n45:41.840 --> 45:46.840\n But almost always I realized that they,\n\n45:47.340 --> 45:50.080\n when I looked in history, they happened before,\n\n45:50.080 --> 45:53.000\n they just happened in other people's lifetimes\n\n45:53.000 --> 45:58.000\n which led me to realize that I needed to study history\n\n45:58.280 --> 46:00.880\n and what happened in other people's lifetimes\n\n46:00.880 --> 46:04.120\n and what happened in other countries and places\n\n46:04.120 --> 46:07.760\n so that I would have timeless and universal principles\n\n46:07.760 --> 46:09.360\n for dealing with that thing.\n\n46:09.360 --> 46:11.960\n So I've, oh yeah, I've been, you know,\n\n46:11.960 --> 46:13.860\n the implausible happening\n\n46:13.860 --> 46:18.860\n but it's like a one in a hundred year storm, okay?\n\n46:19.080 --> 46:20.960\n Or it's or.\n\n46:20.960 --> 46:22.160\n They've happened before.\n\n46:22.160 --> 46:23.100\n Yeah, they've happened.\n\n46:23.100 --> 46:24.400\n Just not to you.\n\n46:24.400 --> 46:28.160\n Let me talk about, if we could, about AI a little bit.\n\n46:28.160 --> 46:32.880\n So we've, Bridgewater Associates manage\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:36.560\n about $160 billion in assets\n\n46:37.680 --> 46:41.200\n and our artificial intelligence systems algorithms\n\n46:41.200 --> 46:43.640\n are pretty good with data.\n\n46:43.640 --> 46:48.000\n What role in the future do you see AI play\n\n46:48.000 --> 46:50.240\n in analysis and decision making\n\n46:50.240 --> 46:55.240\n in this kind of data rich and impactful area of investment?\n\n46:55.240 --> 46:57.880\n I'm gonna answer that not only in investment\n\n46:57.880 --> 47:02.880\n but I give a more all encompassing rule for AI.\n\n47:04.440 --> 47:09.440\n As I think you know, for the last 25 years,\n\n47:09.440 --> 47:13.640\n we have taken our thinking and put them in algorithms\n\n47:13.640 --> 47:15.680\n and so we make decisions.\n\n47:15.680 --> 47:20.120\n The computer takes those criteria, algorithms,\n\n47:20.120 --> 47:22.960\n and they put them, they're in there and it takes data\n\n47:22.960 --> 47:27.280\n and they operate as an independent decision maker\n\n47:27.280 --> 47:29.520\n in parallel with our decision making.\n\n47:29.520 --> 47:33.200\n So for me, it's like there's a chess game playing\n\n47:33.200 --> 47:36.360\n and I'm a person with my chess game\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:38.840\n and I'm saying it made that move and I'm making the move\n\n47:38.840 --> 47:40.680\n and how do I compare those two moves?\n\n47:40.680 --> 47:43.800\n So we've done a lot but let me give you a rule.\n\n47:43.800 --> 47:47.960\n If the future can be different from the past\n\n47:47.960 --> 47:52.960\n and you don't have deep understanding,\n\n47:53.960 --> 47:58.960\n you should not rely on AI, okay?\n\n47:59.280 --> 48:00.520\n Those two things.\n\n48:00.520 --> 48:02.440\n Deep understanding of?\n\n48:02.440 --> 48:05.120\n The cause of fact relationships that are leading you\n\n48:05.120 --> 48:08.280\n to place that bet in anything, okay?\n\n48:08.280 --> 48:10.240\n Anything important.\n\n48:10.240 --> 48:12.080\n Let's say if it was do surgeries\n\n48:12.080 --> 48:14.680\n and you would say, how do I do surgeries?\n\n48:14.680 --> 48:17.200\n I think it's a good idea to do surgeries\n\n48:17.200 --> 48:19.280\n but I think it's totally fine\n\n48:19.280 --> 48:21.920\n to watch all the doctors do the surgeries.\n\n48:21.920 --> 48:26.920\n You can put it on, take a digital camera and do that,\n\n48:28.320 --> 48:33.320\n convert that into AI algorithms that go to robots\n\n48:33.960 --> 48:37.080\n and have them do surgeries and I'd be comfortable with that\n\n48:37.080 --> 48:38.800\n because if it'll do the,\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:41.240\n if it keeps doing the same thing over and over again\n\n48:41.240 --> 48:44.280\n and you have enough of that, that would be fine\n\n48:44.280 --> 48:47.040\n even though you may not understand the algorithms\n\n48:47.040 --> 48:49.440\n because if the thing's happening over and over again\n\n48:49.440 --> 48:52.000\n and you're not asking, the future would be the same.\n\n48:52.000 --> 48:54.200\n That appendicitis or whatever it is\n\n48:54.200 --> 48:57.600\n will be handled the same way, the surgery, that's fine.\n\n48:57.600 --> 49:02.600\n However, what happens with AI is for the most part\n\n49:03.000 --> 49:08.000\n is it takes a lot of data with a high enough sample size\n\n49:09.600 --> 49:13.240\n and then it puts together its own algorithms.\n\n49:13.240 --> 49:16.200\n Okay, there are two ways you can come up with algorithms.\n\n49:16.200 --> 49:18.400\n You can either take your thinking\n\n49:18.400 --> 49:20.640\n and express them in algorithms\n\n49:20.640 --> 49:23.640\n or you can say, put the data in\n\n49:23.640 --> 49:26.280\n and say, what is the algorithm?\n\n49:26.280 --> 49:27.920\n That's machine learning.\n\n49:27.920 --> 49:30.640\n And when you have machine learning,\n\n49:30.640 --> 49:32.080\n it'll give you equations\n\n49:32.080 --> 49:35.160\n which quite often are not understandable.\n\n49:35.160 --> 49:36.160\n If you would try to say,\n\n49:36.160 --> 49:38.400\n okay, now describe what it's telling you,\n\n49:38.400 --> 49:40.160\n it's very difficult to describe\n\n49:40.160 --> 49:42.960\n and so they can escape understanding.\n\n49:42.960 --> 49:46.280\n And so it's very good for doing those things\n\n49:46.280 --> 49:47.960\n that could be done over and over again\n\n49:47.960 --> 49:49.960\n if you're watching and you're not taking that.\n\n49:49.960 --> 49:53.080\n But if the future is different from the past\n\n49:53.080 --> 49:54.000\n and you have that,\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:56.880\n then if the future is different from the past\n\n49:56.880 --> 49:59.080\n and you don't have deep understanding,\n\n49:59.080 --> 50:00.720\n you're gonna get in trouble.\n\n50:00.720 --> 50:03.160\n And so that's the main thing.\n\n50:03.160 --> 50:05.360\n As far as AI is concerned,\n\n50:05.360 --> 50:09.080\n AI and let's say computer replications of thinking\n\n50:09.080 --> 50:13.560\n in very ways, I think it's particularly good for processing.\n\n50:13.560 --> 50:18.280\n But the notion of what you want to do\n\n50:18.280 --> 50:23.040\n is better most of the time determined by the human mind.\n\n50:23.040 --> 50:24.480\n What are the principles?\n\n50:24.480 --> 50:27.520\n Like, okay, how should I raise my children?\n\n50:27.520 --> 50:29.960\n It's gonna be a long time before AI,\n\n50:29.960 --> 50:31.160\n you're going to say,\n\n50:31.160 --> 50:33.120\n it has a good enough judgment to do that.\n\n50:33.120 --> 50:34.720\n Who should I marry?\n\n50:34.720 --> 50:35.600\n All of those things.\n\n50:35.600 --> 50:37.440\n Maybe you can get the computer to help you\n\n50:37.440 --> 50:40.120\n but if you just took data and do machine learning,\n\n50:40.120 --> 50:41.320\n it's not gonna find it.\n\n50:41.320 --> 50:44.440\n If you were to then take one of my criteria\n\n50:44.440 --> 50:47.280\n for any of those questions\n\n50:47.280 --> 50:49.680\n and then say, put them into an algorithm\n\n50:49.680 --> 50:53.160\n and you'd be a lot better off than if you took AI to do it.\n\n50:53.160 --> 50:56.960\n But by and large, the mind should be used\n\n50:56.960 --> 51:00.520\n for inventing and those creative things.\n\n51:00.520 --> 51:04.000\n And then the computer should be used for processing\n\n51:04.000 --> 51:06.920\n because it could process a lot more information,\n\n51:06.920 --> 51:10.280\n a lot faster, a lot more accurately\n\n51:10.280 --> 51:12.240\n and a lot less emotionally.\n\n51:12.240 --> 51:15.120\n So any notion of thinking\n\n51:15.120 --> 51:17.720\n in the form of processing type thinking\n\n51:17.720 --> 51:19.640\n should be done by a computer\n\n51:19.640 --> 51:21.560\n and anything that is in the notion\n\n51:21.560 --> 51:23.480\n of doing that other type of thinking\n\n51:23.480 --> 51:26.800\n should be operating with the brain,\n\n51:26.800 --> 51:29.920\n operating in a way where you can say,\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:31.360\n ah, that makes sense.\n\n51:31.360 --> 51:35.600\n You know, the process of reducing your understanding down\n\n51:35.600 --> 51:38.840\n to principles is kind of like the process,\n\n51:38.840 --> 51:41.600\n the first one you mentioned,\n\n51:41.600 --> 51:45.600\n type of AI algorithm where you're encoding your expertise,\n\n51:45.600 --> 51:47.920\n you're trying to program, write a program,\n\n51:47.920 --> 51:50.400\n the human is trying to write a program.\n\n51:50.400 --> 51:53.560\n How do you think that's attainable?\n\n51:53.560 --> 51:58.560\n The process of reducing principles to a computer program\n\n51:58.560 --> 52:03.560\n or when you say, when you write about,\n\n52:03.560 --> 52:05.800\n when you think about principles,\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:07.440\n is there still a human element\n\n52:07.440 --> 52:10.880\n that's not reducible to an algorithm?\n\n52:12.160 --> 52:17.160\n My experience has been that almost all things,\n\n52:17.560 --> 52:19.560\n including those things that I thought\n\n52:19.560 --> 52:23.720\n were pretty much impossible to express,\n\n52:23.720 --> 52:27.600\n I've been able to express in algorithms,\n\n52:27.600 --> 52:31.120\n but that doesn't constitute all things.\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:36.120\n So you can express far more\n\n52:36.640 --> 52:39.360\n than you can imagine you'll be able to express.\n\n52:39.360 --> 52:41.040\n So I use the example of,\n\n52:41.040 --> 52:43.920\n okay, it's not, how do you raise your children?\n\n52:43.920 --> 52:48.280\n Okay, you will be able to take it one piece by piece.\n\n52:48.280 --> 52:51.600\n Okay, at what age, what school?\n\n52:51.600 --> 52:54.880\n And the way to do that, in my experience,\n\n52:54.880 --> 52:59.880\n is to take that and when you're in the moment\n\n52:59.960 --> 53:04.960\n of making a decision or just past making a decision,\n\n53:04.960 --> 53:09.000\n to take the time and to write down your criteria\n\n53:09.000 --> 53:11.840\n for making that decision in words.\n\n53:11.840 --> 53:16.360\n Okay, that way you'll get your principles down on paper.\n\n53:16.360 --> 53:19.840\n I created an app online call,\n\n53:19.840 --> 53:23.280\n it's right now just on the iPhone, it'll be on Android.\n\n53:23.280 --> 53:25.320\n I tried getting it on Android, come on now.\n\n53:25.320 --> 53:26.640\n Let's get it on Android.\n\n53:26.640 --> 53:28.600\n It'll be, in a few months it'll be on Android.\n\n53:28.600 --> 53:29.440\n Awesome.\n\n53:29.440 --> 53:31.600\n But it has an app in there\n\n53:31.600 --> 53:35.160\n that helps people write down their own principles.\n\n53:35.160 --> 53:37.160\n Because this is very powerful.\n\n53:37.160 --> 53:39.320\n So when you're in that moment\n\n53:39.320 --> 53:41.520\n where you've just, you're thinking about it\n\n53:41.520 --> 53:43.120\n and you're thinking your criteria\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:46.080\n for choosing the school for your child\n\n53:46.080 --> 53:47.640\n or whatever that might be,\n\n53:47.640 --> 53:49.680\n and you write down your criteria\n\n53:49.680 --> 53:52.200\n or whatever they are, those principles,\n\n53:52.200 --> 53:57.200\n you write down and that will at that moment\n\n53:57.440 --> 54:02.160\n make you articulate your principles in a very valuable way.\n\n54:02.160 --> 54:04.840\n And if you have the way that we operate\n\n54:04.840 --> 54:06.480\n that you have easy access,\n\n54:06.480 --> 54:08.800\n so then the next time that comes along,\n\n54:08.800 --> 54:09.920\n you can go to that,\n\n54:09.920 --> 54:12.000\n or you can show those principles to others\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:13.920\n to see if they're the right principles.\n\n54:13.920 --> 54:16.920\n You will get a clarity of that principle\n\n54:16.920 --> 54:19.080\n that's really invaluable in words\n\n54:19.080 --> 54:21.120\n and that'll help you a lot.\n\n54:21.120 --> 54:23.040\n But then you start to think,\n\n54:23.040 --> 54:26.080\n how do I express that in data?\n\n54:26.080 --> 54:29.320\n And it'll shock you about how you can do that.\n\n54:29.320 --> 54:33.360\n You'll form an equation that will show the relationship\n\n54:33.360 --> 54:35.040\n between these particular parts\n\n54:35.040 --> 54:38.440\n and then essentially the variables\n\n54:38.440 --> 54:41.560\n that are going to go into that particular equation\n\n54:41.560 --> 54:43.120\n and you will be able to do that.\n\n54:43.120 --> 54:45.160\n And you take that little piece\n\n54:45.160 --> 54:48.080\n and you put it into the computer.\n\n54:48.080 --> 54:49.920\n And then take the next little piece\n\n54:49.920 --> 54:51.960\n and you put that into the computer.\n\n54:51.960 --> 54:54.080\n And before you know it,\n\n54:54.080 --> 54:56.280\n you will have a decision making system\n\n54:56.280 --> 54:58.120\n that's of the sort that I'm describing.\n\n54:58.120 --> 55:00.560\n So you're almost making an argument\n\n55:00.560 --> 55:03.160\n against an earlier statement you've made.\n\n55:03.160 --> 55:04.200\n You're convincing me.\n\n55:04.200 --> 55:05.440\n At first you said,\n\n55:05.440 --> 55:08.920\n there's no way a computer could raise a child essentially.\n\n55:10.000 --> 55:12.160\n But now you've described making me think of it.\n\n55:12.160 --> 55:16.080\n If you have that kind of idea meritocracy,\n\n55:16.080 --> 55:17.600\n you have this rigorous approach\n\n55:17.600 --> 55:19.280\n that Bridgewater takes with investment\n\n55:19.280 --> 55:21.880\n and applied to raising a child.\n\n55:21.880 --> 55:24.920\n It feels like through the process you just described,\n\n55:24.920 --> 55:29.120\n we could as a society arrive at a set of principles\n\n55:29.120 --> 55:33.880\n for raising a child and encode it into computer.\n\n55:33.880 --> 55:38.880\n That originality will not come from machine learning.\n\n55:39.280 --> 55:40.800\n The first time you do,\n\n55:40.800 --> 55:42.280\n so that the original, yes.\n\n55:42.280 --> 55:43.200\n That's what I'm referring to.\n\n55:43.200 --> 55:45.960\n But eventually as we together develop it\n\n55:45.960 --> 55:47.280\n and then we can automate it.\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:50.160\n That's why I'm saying the processing\n\n55:50.160 --> 55:51.800\n can be done by the computer.\n\n55:51.800 --> 55:53.240\n So we're saying the same thing.\n\n55:53.240 --> 55:54.920\n We're not inconsistent.\n\n55:54.920 --> 55:56.440\n We're saying the same thing.\n\n55:56.440 --> 55:58.600\n That the processing of that information\n\n55:58.600 --> 56:01.240\n and those algorithms can be done by the computer\n\n56:01.240 --> 56:03.560\n in a very, very effective way.\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:05.280\n You don't need to sit there and process\n\n56:05.280 --> 56:07.680\n and try to weigh all those things in your equation\n\n56:07.680 --> 56:09.040\n and all those things.\n\n56:09.040 --> 56:10.800\n But that notion of,\n\n56:10.800 --> 56:13.760\n okay, how do I get at that principle?\n\n56:13.760 --> 56:15.720\n And you're saying you'd be surprised.\n\n56:15.720 --> 56:18.880\n How much you can express.\n\n56:18.880 --> 56:19.720\n That's right.\n\n56:19.720 --> 56:22.080\n You can do that.\n\n56:22.080 --> 56:25.800\n So this is where I think you're going to see the future.\n\n56:25.800 --> 56:30.800\n And right now we go to our devices\n\n56:30.960 --> 56:35.640\n and we get information to a large extent.\n\n56:35.640 --> 56:37.480\n And then we get some guidance.\n\n56:37.480 --> 56:39.640\n We have our GPS and the like.\n\n56:39.640 --> 56:42.400\n In my opinion, principles.\n\n56:42.400 --> 56:43.800\n Principles, principles, principles.\n\n56:43.800 --> 56:44.960\n I wanna emphasize that.\n\n56:44.960 --> 56:46.480\n You write them down.\n\n56:46.480 --> 56:48.280\n You've got those principles.\n\n56:48.280 --> 56:52.720\n They will be converted into algorithms for decision making.\n\n56:52.720 --> 56:55.200\n And they're gonna also have the benefit\n\n56:55.200 --> 56:57.360\n of collective decision making.\n\n56:57.360 --> 56:58.880\n Because right now,\n\n56:58.880 --> 57:01.880\n individuals based on what's stuck in their heads\n\n57:01.880 --> 57:05.200\n are making their decisions in very ignorant ways.\n\n57:05.200 --> 57:06.960\n They're not the best decision makers.\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:08.880\n They're not the best criteria.\n\n57:08.880 --> 57:10.040\n And they're operating.\n\n57:10.040 --> 57:12.520\n When those principles are written down\n\n57:12.520 --> 57:14.840\n and converted into algorithms,\n\n57:14.840 --> 57:16.560\n it's almost like you'll look at that\n\n57:16.560 --> 57:18.240\n and follow the instructions\n\n57:18.240 --> 57:20.720\n and it'll give you better results.\n\n57:20.720 --> 57:23.760\n Medicine will be much more like this.\n\n57:23.760 --> 57:25.560\n You can go to your local doctor\n\n57:25.560 --> 57:27.840\n and you could ask his point of view and whatever.\n\n57:27.840 --> 57:31.400\n And he's rushed and he may not be the best doctor around.\n\n57:31.400 --> 57:33.360\n And you're gonna go to this thing\n\n57:33.360 --> 57:35.160\n and give that same information\n\n57:35.160 --> 57:37.760\n or just automatically have it input in that.\n\n57:37.760 --> 57:41.440\n And it's gonna tell you, okay, here's what you should go do.\n\n57:41.440 --> 57:44.240\n And it's gonna be much better than your local doctor.\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:49.240\n And that, the converting of information into intelligence,\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.680\n okay, intelligence is the thing.\n\n57:52.680 --> 57:55.760\n We're coming out with, again, I'm 70\n\n57:55.760 --> 57:57.920\n and I wanna pass all these things along.\n\n57:57.920 --> 58:02.920\n So all these tools that I've found need to develop\n\n58:03.240 --> 58:04.960\n all over these periods of time,\n\n58:04.960 --> 58:07.440\n all those things I wanna make available.\n\n58:07.440 --> 58:10.960\n And what's gonna happen as they're going to see this,\n\n58:10.960 --> 58:13.400\n they're going to see these tools\n\n58:13.400 --> 58:15.000\n operating much more that way.\n\n58:15.000 --> 58:20.000\n The idea of converting data into intelligence.\n\n58:20.040 --> 58:23.880\n Intelligence, for example, on what they are like.\n\n58:23.880 --> 58:25.400\n Or what are your strengths and weaknesses?\n\n58:25.400 --> 58:28.280\n Intelligence on who do I work well with\n\n58:28.280 --> 58:29.440\n under what circumstances?\n\n58:29.440 --> 58:30.280\n The personalized.\n\n58:30.280 --> 58:31.360\n Intelligence.\n\n58:31.360 --> 58:35.680\n We're gonna go from what are called systems of record,\n\n58:35.680 --> 58:38.280\n which are a lot of, okay, information organized\n\n58:38.280 --> 58:41.600\n in the right way, to intelligence.\n\n58:41.600 --> 58:46.600\n And that'll be the next big move, in my opinion.\n\n58:46.680 --> 58:49.920\n And so you will get intelligence back.\n\n58:49.920 --> 58:52.200\n And that intelligence comes from reducing things\n\n58:52.200 --> 58:54.120\n down to principles into.\n\n58:54.120 --> 58:55.480\n That's how it happens.\n\n58:55.480 --> 58:58.880\n So what's your intuition if we look at future societies?\n\n58:58.880 --> 59:03.880\n Do you think we'll be able to reduce a lot of the details\n\n59:06.640 --> 59:08.280\n of our lives down to principles\n\n59:08.280 --> 59:10.200\n that would be further and further automated?\n\n59:10.200 --> 59:12.760\n I think the real question hinges\n\n59:12.760 --> 59:17.760\n on people's emotions and irrational behaviors.\n\n59:20.920 --> 59:25.920\n I think that there's subliminal things that we want, okay?\n\n59:25.920 --> 59:30.000\n And then there's cerebral, conscious logic.\n\n59:30.000 --> 59:32.920\n And the two often are at odds.\n\n59:32.920 --> 59:36.680\n So there's almost like two you's in you, right?\n\n59:36.680 --> 59:39.920\n And so let's say, what do you want?\n\n59:39.920 --> 59:42.280\n And your mind will answer one thing,\n\n59:42.280 --> 59:44.680\n your emotions will answer something else.\n\n59:44.680 --> 59:47.920\n So when I think about it, I think emotions are,\n\n59:47.920 --> 59:52.320\n I want inspiration, I want love is a good thing,\n\n59:52.320 --> 59:54.040\n being able to have a good impact,\n\n59:54.040 --> 59:59.040\n but it is in the reconciliation of your subliminal wants\n\n1:00:00.400 --> 1:00:02.720\n and your intellectual wants\n\n1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:05.800\n so that you really say they're aligned.\n\n1:00:05.800 --> 1:00:08.880\n And so to do that in a way to get what you want.\n\n1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.360\n So irrationality is a bad thing\n\n1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:16.480\n if it means that it doesn't make sense\n\n1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:18.200\n in getting you what you want,\n\n1:00:18.200 --> 1:00:20.200\n but you better decide which you you're satisfying.\n\n1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:23.400\n Is it the lower level you, emotional, subliminal one,\n\n1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:24.600\n or is it the other?\n\n1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.080\n But if you can align them.\n\n1:00:26.080 --> 1:00:30.440\n So what I find is that by going from my,\n\n1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:34.800\n you experience the decision, do this thing subliminally.\n\n1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:36.040\n And that's the thing I want.\n\n1:00:36.040 --> 1:00:37.720\n It comes to the surface.\n\n1:00:37.720 --> 1:00:40.360\n I find that if I can align that\n\n1:00:40.360 --> 1:00:42.640\n with what my logical me wants\n\n1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.920\n and do the double check between them\n\n1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:47.920\n and I get the same sort of thing,\n\n1:00:47.920 --> 1:00:49.760\n that that helps me a lot.\n\n1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.080\n I find, for example, meditation is one of the things\n\n1:00:53.080 --> 1:00:55.200\n that helps to achieve that alignment.\n\n1:00:55.200 --> 1:00:58.480\n It's fantastic for achieving that alignment.\n\n1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:02.160\n And often then I also want to not just do it in my head.\n\n1:01:02.160 --> 1:01:03.600\n I want to say, does that make sense?\n\n1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:04.440\n Help you.\n\n1:01:04.440 --> 1:01:07.160\n And so I do it with other people and I say, okay,\n\n1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:09.440\n well, let's say I want this thing and whatever.\n\n1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:10.720\n Does that make sense?\n\n1:01:10.720 --> 1:01:13.640\n And when you do that kind of triangulation,\n\n1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:17.800\n your two you's, and you do that with also the other way,\n\n1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:21.240\n then you certainly want to be rational, right?\n\n1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:24.600\n But rationality has to be defined by those things.\n\n1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.760\n And then you discover sort of new ideas\n\n1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:30.840\n that drive your future.\n\n1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.680\n So it's always, you're always at the edge\n\n1:01:32.680 --> 1:01:34.360\n of the set of principles you've developed.\n\n1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:36.160\n You're doing new things always.\n\n1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:38.360\n That's where the intellect is needed.\n\n1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:40.600\n Well, and the inspiration.\n\n1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:43.600\n The inspiration is needed to do that, right?\n\n1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:45.280\n Like what are you doing it for?\n\n1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:46.960\n It's the excitement.\n\n1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:47.800\n What is that thing?\n\n1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:49.800\n The adventure, the curiosity, the hunger.\n\n1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.720\n What's, if you can be Freud for a second,\n\n1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:55.000\n what's in that subconscious?\n\n1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.400\n What's the thing that drives us?\n\n1:01:57.400 --> 1:02:00.000\n I think you can't generalize of us.\n\n1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.640\n I think different people are driven by different things.\n\n1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:04.800\n There's not a common one, right?\n\n1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:07.960\n So like if you would take the shapers,\n\n1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:12.960\n I think it is a combination of, subliminally,\n\n1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:18.040\n it's a combination of excitement, curiosity.\n\n1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:20.000\n Is there a dark element there?\n\n1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.800\n Is there demons?\n\n1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:22.840\n Is there fears?\n\n1:02:22.840 --> 1:02:25.960\n Is there, in your sense, something dark that drives them?\n\n1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:27.960\n Most of the ones that I'm dealing with,\n\n1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:29.720\n I have not seen that.\n\n1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:33.280\n I see the, what I really see is,\n\n1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:37.680\n ooh, if I can do that, that would be the most dream.\n\n1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.280\n And then the act of creativity.\n\n1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:41.400\n And you say, ooh.\n\n1:02:41.400 --> 1:02:44.200\n So excitement is one of the things.\n\n1:02:44.200 --> 1:02:47.960\n Curiosity is a big pull, okay?\n\n1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.760\n And then tenacity, you know, okay, to do those things.\n\n1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:55.360\n But definitely emotions are entering into it.\n\n1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:58.760\n Then there's an intellectual component of it too, okay?\n\n1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:01.160\n It may be empathy.\n\n1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:02.800\n Can I have an impact?\n\n1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:04.440\n Can I have an impact?\n\n1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:06.040\n The desire to have an impact.\n\n1:03:06.040 --> 1:03:10.280\n That's an emotional thrill, but it also has empathy.\n\n1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:12.760\n And then you start to see spirituality.\n\n1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:16.000\n By spirituality, I mean the connectedness to the whole.\n\n1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.360\n You start to see people operate those things.\n\n1:03:18.360 --> 1:03:21.440\n Those tend to be the things that you see the most of.\n\n1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:25.480\n And I think you're gonna shut down this idea completely,\n\n1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:29.560\n but there's a notion that some of these shapers\n\n1:03:29.560 --> 1:03:33.480\n really walk the line between sort of madness and genius.\n\n1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:36.960\n Do you think madness has a role in any of this?\n\n1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:40.280\n Or do you still see Steve Jobs and Elon Musk\n\n1:03:40.280 --> 1:03:42.160\n as fundamentally rational?\n\n1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:43.960\n Yeah, there's a continuum there.\n\n1:03:43.960 --> 1:03:47.720\n And what comes to my mind is that\n\n1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:52.720\n genius is often at the edge,\n\n1:03:52.960 --> 1:03:56.440\n in some cases, imaginary genius,\n\n1:03:56.440 --> 1:04:00.240\n is at the edge of insanity.\n\n1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.880\n And it's almost like a radio that I think,\n\n1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:06.720\n okay, if I can tune it just right, it's playing right,\n\n1:04:06.720 --> 1:04:11.720\n but if I go a little bit too far, it goes off, okay?\n\n1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:14.720\n And so you can see this.\n\n1:04:14.720 --> 1:04:17.360\n Kay Jamison was studying bipolar.\n\n1:04:17.360 --> 1:04:22.000\n What it shows is that that's definitely the case,\n\n1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:23.600\n because when you're going out there,\n\n1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:26.400\n that imagination, whatever, is at the,\n\n1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:29.000\n can be near the edge sometimes.\n\n1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.280\n Doesn't have to always be.\n\n1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.320\n So let me ask you about automation.\n\n1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.200\n That's been a part of public discourse recently.\n\n1:04:38.400 --> 1:04:41.800\n What's your view on the impact of automation,\n\n1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:44.240\n of whether we're talking about AI\n\n1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:46.960\n and more basic forms of automation on the economy\n\n1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:49.120\n in the short term and the long term?\n\n1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.720\n Do you have concerns about it, as some do,\n\n1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:55.360\n or do you think it's overblown?\n\n1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:56.200\n It's not overblown.\n\n1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.480\n I mean, it's a giant thing.\n\n1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:01.280\n It'll come at us in a very big way in the future.\n\n1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:04.440\n We're right at the edge of even really accelerating it.\n\n1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:07.880\n It's had a big impact, and it will have a big impact.\n\n1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.400\n And it's a two edged sword,\n\n1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:14.400\n because it'll have tremendous benefits.\n\n1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:18.580\n And at the same time, it has profound benefits\n\n1:05:18.580 --> 1:05:21.420\n in employment and distributions of wealth,\n\n1:05:21.420 --> 1:05:25.160\n because the way I think about it is,\n\n1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:27.560\n there are certain things human beings can do.\n\n1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:31.880\n And over time, we've evolved to go\n\n1:05:31.880 --> 1:05:34.360\n to almost higher and higher levels.\n\n1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:36.960\n And now we're almost like, we're at this level.\n\n1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:39.120\n You know, it used to be your labor,\n\n1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.400\n and you would then do your labor,\n\n1:05:41.400 --> 1:05:42.960\n and okay, we can get past the labor.\n\n1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:44.240\n We got tractors and things,\n\n1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.160\n and you go up, up, up, up, up,\n\n1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:47.320\n and we're up over here,\n\n1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:50.000\n and up to the point in our minds,\n\n1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:55.000\n where okay, anything related to mental processing,\n\n1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:57.320\n the computer can probably do better,\n\n1:05:57.320 --> 1:05:58.560\n and we can find that.\n\n1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:01.900\n And so other than almost inventing,\n\n1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:05.460\n you're at a point where the machines\n\n1:06:05.460 --> 1:06:09.680\n and the automation will probably do it better.\n\n1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:12.840\n And that's accelerating, and that's a force,\n\n1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:15.480\n and that's a force for the good.\n\n1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:17.880\n And at the same time,\n\n1:06:17.880 --> 1:06:20.720\n what it does is it displaces people\n\n1:06:20.720 --> 1:06:22.800\n in terms of employment and changes,\n\n1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:25.240\n and it produces wealth gaps and all of that.\n\n1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:28.000\n So I think the real issue is that\n\n1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:32.160\n that has to be viewed as a national emergency.\n\n1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:35.240\n In other words, I think the wealth gap,\n\n1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:37.640\n the income gap, the opportunity gap,\n\n1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:40.440\n all of those things that force\n\n1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:43.940\n is creating the problems that we're having today,\n\n1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:47.120\n a lot of the problems, the great polarity,\n\n1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:49.120\n the disenfranchised,\n\n1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.120\n not anything approaching equality of education,\n\n1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:56.620\n all of these problems,\n\n1:06:56.620 --> 1:06:59.360\n a lot of problems are coming as a result of that.\n\n1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:02.520\n And so it needs to be viewed really\n\n1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:05.440\n as an emergency situation\n\n1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:08.400\n in which there's a good work,\n\n1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:13.400\n good plan worked out for how to deal with that effectively,\n\n1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:17.160\n so that it's dealt with effectively.\n\n1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:21.640\n So because it's good for the average,\n\n1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:23.120\n it's good for the impact,\n\n1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:24.440\n but it's not good for everyone,\n\n1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:25.960\n and that creates that polarity.\n\n1:07:25.960 --> 1:07:27.800\n So it's gotta be dealt with.\n\n1:07:27.800 --> 1:07:30.020\n Yeah, and you've talked about the American dream,\n\n1:07:30.020 --> 1:07:32.720\n and that that's something that all people\n\n1:07:32.720 --> 1:07:34.080\n should have an opportunity for,\n\n1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:36.680\n and that we need to reform capitalism\n\n1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:39.360\n to give that opportunity for everyone.\n\n1:07:39.360 --> 1:07:43.520\n Let me ask on one of the ideas\n\n1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:46.280\n in terms of safety nets that support\n\n1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:47.840\n that kind of opportunity.\n\n1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:49.040\n There's been a lot of discussion\n\n1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:51.760\n of universal basic income amongst people.\n\n1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.400\n So there's Andrew Yang, who's running on that.\n\n1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:57.880\n He's a political candidate running for president\n\n1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:00.480\n on the idea of universal basic income.\n\n1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:01.880\n What do you think about that,\n\n1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:05.640\n giving $1,000 or some amount of money to everybody\n\n1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:09.360\n as a way to give them the padding,\n\n1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:12.400\n the freedom to sort of take leaps,\n\n1:08:12.400 --> 1:08:14.240\n to take the call for adventure,\n\n1:08:14.240 --> 1:08:16.800\n to take the crazy pursuits?\n\n1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:19.200\n Before I get right into my thoughts\n\n1:08:19.200 --> 1:08:20.520\n on universal basic income,\n\n1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:25.520\n I wanna start with the notion that opportunity,\n\n1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:31.800\n education, development, creating equality,\n\n1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:36.240\n so that people say there's equal opportunity\n\n1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:39.760\n and is the most important thing.\n\n1:08:39.760 --> 1:08:43.120\n And then to find out what is the amount,\n\n1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.080\n how are you going to provide that?\n\n1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:50.080\n How do you get the money into a public school system?\n\n1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:52.400\n How do you get the teaching?\n\n1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:57.400\n The fleshing out that plan to create equal opportunity\n\n1:08:57.680 --> 1:09:00.580\n in all of its various forms\n\n1:09:00.580 --> 1:09:03.000\n is the most pressing thing to do.\n\n1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.240\n And so that is that.\n\n1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:08.360\n The opportunity, the most important one\n\n1:09:08.360 --> 1:09:11.440\n you're kind of implying is the earlier, the better.\n\n1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:14.480\n Sort of like opportunity to education.\n\n1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:17.820\n So in the early development of a human being\n\n1:09:17.820 --> 1:09:20.120\n is when you should have the equal opportunities.\n\n1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:21.080\n That's the most important.\n\n1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:24.240\n Right, in the first phase of your life,\n\n1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:27.860\n which goes from birth until you're on your own\n\n1:09:27.860 --> 1:09:30.560\n and you're an adult and you're now out there.\n\n1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.680\n And you deal with early childhood development, okay?\n\n1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.040\n And you take the brain and you say, what's important?\n\n1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:42.680\n The childcare, okay, it makes a world of difference,\n\n1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:44.740\n for example, if you have good parents\n\n1:09:44.740 --> 1:09:48.760\n who are trying to think about instilling the stability\n\n1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:52.100\n in a non traumatic environment to provide them.\n\n1:09:52.100 --> 1:09:53.800\n So I would say the good guidance\n\n1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:55.840\n that normally comes from parents\n\n1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:59.520\n and the good education that they're receiving\n\n1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:06.240\n are the most important things in that person's development.\n\n1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:10.400\n The ability to be able to be prepared to go out there\n\n1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:12.800\n and then to go into a market\n\n1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:15.880\n that's an equal opportunity job market,\n\n1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:19.040\n to be able to then go into that kind of market\n\n1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:22.840\n is a system that creates not only fairness,\n\n1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:25.000\n anything else is not fair.\n\n1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.160\n And then in addition to that,\n\n1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.440\n it also is a more effective economic system\n\n1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:33.740\n because the consequences of not doing that\n\n1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:35.760\n to a society are devastating.\n\n1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:38.600\n If you look at what the difference in outcomes\n\n1:10:38.600 --> 1:10:40.960\n for somebody who completes high school\n\n1:10:40.960 --> 1:10:42.560\n or doesn't complete high school,\n\n1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:45.880\n or does each one of those state changes.\n\n1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:47.800\n And you look at what that means\n\n1:10:47.800 --> 1:10:52.120\n in terms of their costs to society, not only themselves,\n\n1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:54.720\n but their cost and incarceration costs\n\n1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:57.520\n and crimes and all of those things.\n\n1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:00.760\n It's economically better for the society\n\n1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:05.760\n and it's fairer if they can get those particular things.\n\n1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:07.760\n Once they have those things,\n\n1:11:07.760 --> 1:11:09.280\n then you move on to other things.\n\n1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:13.160\n But yes, from birth all the way through that process,\n\n1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:18.160\n anything less than that is bad, is a tragedy and so on.\n\n1:11:18.920 --> 1:11:20.400\n So that's what, yeah,\n\n1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:22.200\n those are the things that I'm estimating.\n\n1:11:22.200 --> 1:11:27.200\n And so what I would want above all else is to provide that.\n\n1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:28.720\n So with that in mind,\n\n1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:30.840\n now we'll talk about universal basic income.\n\n1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:33.280\n Start with that, now we can talk about UBI.\n\n1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:34.920\n Right, because you have to have that.\n\n1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:38.160\n Now the question is what's the best way to provide that?\n\n1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.360\n So when I look at UBI,\n\n1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:43.880\n I really think is what is going to happen\n\n1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:46.280\n with that $1,000, okay?\n\n1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:50.540\n And will that $1,000 come from another program?\n\n1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:54.200\n Does that come from an early childhood developmental program?\n\n1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:57.200\n Who are you giving the $1,000 to\n\n1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:59.720\n and what will they do for that $1,000?\n\n1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:01.920\n I mean, like my reaction would be,\n\n1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:04.060\n I think it's a great thing that everybody\n\n1:12:04.060 --> 1:12:07.760\n should have almost $1,000 in their bank and so on.\n\n1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:10.680\n But when do they get to make decisions or who's the parent?\n\n1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:14.000\n A lot of times you can give $1,000 to somebody\n\n1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.760\n and it could have a negative result.\n\n1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:19.320\n It can have, they can use that money detrimentally,\n\n1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:21.080\n not just productively.\n\n1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:22.920\n And if that money's coming away\n\n1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:24.480\n from some of those other things\n\n1:12:24.480 --> 1:12:26.440\n that are gonna produce the things I want\n\n1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.840\n and you're shifted to, let's say,\n\n1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.400\n to come in and give a check,\n\n1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:32.580\n doesn't mean its outcomes are going to be good\n\n1:12:32.580 --> 1:12:33.720\n in providing those things\n\n1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:36.540\n that I think are so fundamental important.\n\n1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:39.580\n If it was just everybody can have $1,000 and use it\n\n1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:40.420\n so when the time comes.\n\n1:12:40.420 --> 1:12:41.240\n Use it well, right.\n\n1:12:41.240 --> 1:12:44.240\n And use it well, that would be really, really good\n\n1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:46.640\n because it's almost like everybody,\n\n1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:48.440\n you'd wish everybody could have $1,000\n\n1:12:48.440 --> 1:12:51.680\n worth of wiggle room in their lives, okay.\n\n1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:53.960\n And I think that would be great.\n\n1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:55.040\n I love that.\n\n1:12:55.040 --> 1:12:58.360\n But I wanna make sure that these other things\n\n1:12:58.360 --> 1:12:59.420\n that are taken care of.\n\n1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:01.360\n So if it comes out of that budget\n\n1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:04.120\n and I don't want it to come out of that budget\n\n1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:06.000\n that's gonna be doing those things.\n\n1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.840\n And so you have to figure it out.\n\n1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:10.500\n And you have a certain skepticism\n\n1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:13.980\n that human nature will use,\n\n1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:16.800\n may not always, in fact frequently,\n\n1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:19.680\n may not use that $1,000 for the optimal,\n\n1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:21.960\n to support the optimal trajectory.\n\n1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:23.800\n Some will and some won't.\n\n1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:27.380\n One of the big advantages of universal basic income\n\n1:13:27.380 --> 1:13:29.680\n is that if you put it in the hands,\n\n1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:32.400\n let's say of parents who know how to do the right things\n\n1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:34.960\n and make the right choices for their children\n\n1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.080\n because they're responsible\n\n1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:38.920\n and you say I'm gonna give them $1,000 wiggle room\n\n1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:41.440\n to use for the benefit of their children.\n\n1:13:41.440 --> 1:13:43.300\n Wow, that sounds great.\n\n1:13:43.300 --> 1:13:47.480\n If you put it in the hands of let's say an alcoholic\n\n1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:52.160\n or drug addicted parent who is not making those choices\n\n1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:53.840\n well for their children\n\n1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:56.360\n and what they do is they take that $1,000\n\n1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.100\n and they don't use it well,\n\n1:13:58.100 --> 1:14:01.040\n then that's gonna produce more harm than good.\n\n1:14:01.040 --> 1:14:02.220\n Well put.\n\n1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:03.840\n You're, if I may say so,\n\n1:14:03.840 --> 1:14:05.780\n one of the richest people in the world.\n\n1:14:06.820 --> 1:14:09.120\n So you're a good person to ask.\n\n1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:11.300\n Does money buy happiness?\n\n1:14:11.300 --> 1:14:14.760\n No, it's been shown that between,\n\n1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:18.800\n once you get over a basic level of income\n\n1:14:18.800 --> 1:14:21.920\n so that you can take care of the pain\n\n1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:24.240\n that you can, health and whatever,\n\n1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:28.120\n there's no correlation between the level of happiness\n\n1:14:28.120 --> 1:14:32.080\n that one has and the level of money that one has.\n\n1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:35.780\n That thing that has the highest correlation\n\n1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:39.680\n is quality relationships with others, community.\n\n1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:41.760\n If you look at surveys of these things\n\n1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:44.740\n across all surveys and all societies,\n\n1:14:44.740 --> 1:14:49.660\n it's a sense of community and interpersonal relationships.\n\n1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:52.600\n That is not in any way correlated with money.\n\n1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:57.320\n You can go down to native tribes in very poor places\n\n1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.480\n or you can go in all different communities\n\n1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:03.200\n and so they have the opportunity to have that.\n\n1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:06.980\n I'm very lucky in that I started with nothing\n\n1:15:06.980 --> 1:15:08.320\n so I have the full range.\n\n1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:11.080\n I can tell you I'm not having money\n\n1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:13.920\n and then having quite a lot of money\n\n1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:16.040\n and I did that in the right order.\n\n1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:17.880\n So you started from nothing in Long Island.\n\n1:15:17.880 --> 1:15:20.620\n Yeah, and my dad was a jazz musician\n\n1:15:20.620 --> 1:15:23.160\n but I had all really that I needed\n\n1:15:23.160 --> 1:15:25.800\n because I had two parents who loved me\n\n1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:28.920\n and took good care of me and I went to a public school\n\n1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:30.760\n that was a good public school\n\n1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:34.080\n and basically you don't need much more than that\n\n1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:36.920\n in order to, that's the equal opportunity part.\n\n1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:40.720\n Anyway, what I'm saying is I experienced the range\n\n1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:44.620\n and there are many studies on the answer to your question.\n\n1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:46.840\n No money does not bring happiness.\n\n1:15:48.220 --> 1:15:52.560\n Money gives you an ability to make choices.\n\n1:15:52.560 --> 1:15:57.520\n Does it get in the way in any way\n\n1:15:57.520 --> 1:16:00.560\n of forming those deep, meaningful relationships?\n\n1:16:00.560 --> 1:16:01.600\n It can.\n\n1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:03.320\n There are lots of ways that it makes negative.\n\n1:16:03.320 --> 1:16:04.480\n That's one of them.\n\n1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:06.200\n It could stand in the way of that.\n\n1:16:06.200 --> 1:16:08.480\n Yes, okay.\n\n1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:11.720\n But I could almost list the ways that it could stand.\n\n1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:12.840\n It could be a problem.\n\n1:16:12.840 --> 1:16:15.420\n Yeah, what does it buy?\n\n1:16:15.420 --> 1:16:19.580\n So if you can elaborate, you mentioned a bit of freedom.\n\n1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:21.400\n At the most fundamental level,\n\n1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:25.320\n it doesn't take a whole lot but it takes enough\n\n1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:30.320\n that you can take care of yourself and your family\n\n1:16:30.320 --> 1:16:35.320\n to be able to learn,\n\n1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:40.280\n do the basics of, have the relationships,\n\n1:16:40.280 --> 1:16:44.480\n have healthcare, the basics of those types of things.\n\n1:16:44.480 --> 1:16:46.580\n You know, you can cover the patients.\n\n1:16:46.580 --> 1:16:50.320\n And then to have maybe enough security\n\n1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:52.320\n but maybe not too much security.\n\n1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:53.440\n That's right, yeah.\n\n1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.760\n That you essentially are okay.\n\n1:16:57.760 --> 1:17:00.680\n Okay, that's really good.\n\n1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:04.160\n And you don't, that's what money will get you.\n\n1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:06.580\n And everything else could go either way.\n\n1:17:06.580 --> 1:17:08.000\n Well, no, there's more.\n\n1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:08.820\n There's more.\n\n1:17:08.820 --> 1:17:09.800\n Okay.\n\n1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:13.520\n Then beyond that, what it then starts to do,\n\n1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.120\n that's the most important thing.\n\n1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:18.020\n But beyond that, what it starts to do\n\n1:17:18.020 --> 1:17:22.840\n is to help to make your dreams happen in various ways.\n\n1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:27.840\n Okay, so for example, now I, you know, like in my case,\n\n1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:32.080\n it's like those dreams might not be just my own dreams,\n\n1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:35.760\n they're impact on others dreams, okay?\n\n1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:40.400\n So my own dreams might be, I don't know,\n\n1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:43.640\n I can pass along these, at my stage in life,\n\n1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:45.360\n I could pass along these principles to you\n\n1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:49.840\n and I can give those things or I could do whatever.\n\n1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:54.840\n I can go on an adventure, I can start a business,\n\n1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:58.040\n I can do those other things, be productive,\n\n1:17:58.040 --> 1:18:00.720\n I can self actualize in ways\n\n1:18:00.720 --> 1:18:04.300\n that might be not possible otherwise.\n\n1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:07.880\n And so that's my own belief.\n\n1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:11.000\n And then I can also help others.\n\n1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.640\n I mean, this is, you know, to the extent when you get older\n\n1:18:13.640 --> 1:18:17.080\n and with time and whatever, you start to feel connected,\n\n1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:19.960\n spirituality, that's what I'm referring to,\n\n1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.840\n you can start to have an effect on others\n\n1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:24.480\n that's beneficial and so on, gives you the ability.\n\n1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.120\n I could tell you that people who are very wealthy\n\n1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:32.320\n who have that feel that they don't have enough money.\n\n1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:35.200\n Bill Gates will feel almost broke\n\n1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:39.040\n because relative to the things he'd like to accomplish\n\n1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.760\n through the Gates Foundation and things like that,\n\n1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:44.160\n you know, oh my God, he doesn't have enough money\n\n1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.440\n to accomplish the things he wishes for.\n\n1:18:46.440 --> 1:18:49.240\n But those things are not, you know,\n\n1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:51.560\n they're not the most fundamental things.\n\n1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:56.240\n So I think that people sometimes think money has value.\n\n1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:58.480\n Money doesn't have value.\n\n1:18:58.480 --> 1:18:59.920\n Money is, like you say,\n\n1:18:59.920 --> 1:19:02.960\n just a medium of exchange at a store all the while.\n\n1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:05.000\n And so what you have to say is,\n\n1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.400\n what is it that you're going to buy?\n\n1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:10.120\n Now, there are other people who get their gratification\n\n1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.440\n in ways that are different from me,\n\n1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:14.640\n but I think in many cases,\n\n1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:18.920\n let's say somebody who used money to have a status symbol,\n\n1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:20.240\n what would I say?\n\n1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:22.240\n Or that's probably unhealthy.\n\n1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:25.120\n But then, I don't know, somebody who says,\n\n1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:28.120\n I love a great, gorgeous painting\n\n1:19:28.120 --> 1:19:29.960\n and it's going to cost lots of money.\n\n1:19:29.960 --> 1:19:33.880\n In my priorities, I can't get there.\n\n1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:38.520\n But that doesn't mean, who am I to judge others\n\n1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:41.040\n in terms of, let's say, their element of the freedom\n\n1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:42.160\n to do those things.\n\n1:19:42.160 --> 1:19:43.920\n So it's a little bit complicated.\n\n1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.920\n But by and large, that's my view on money and wealth.\n\n1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:53.840\n So let me ask you in terms of the idea of,\n\n1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:56.640\n so much of your passions in life has been\n\n1:19:56.640 --> 1:19:59.880\n through something you might be able to call work.\n\n1:19:59.880 --> 1:20:02.000\n Alan Watts has this quote.\n\n1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.440\n He said that the real key to life, secret to life,\n\n1:20:06.440 --> 1:20:08.960\n is to be completely engaged with what you're doing\n\n1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:10.600\n in the here and now.\n\n1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:14.200\n And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.\n\n1:20:14.200 --> 1:20:17.920\n So I'd like to ask, what is the role of work\n\n1:20:17.920 --> 1:20:21.600\n in your life's journey, or in a life's journey?\n\n1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.040\n And what do you think about this modern idea\n\n1:20:24.040 --> 1:20:28.080\n of kind of separating work and work life balance?\n\n1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:31.200\n I have a principle that I believe in is,\n\n1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.520\n make your work and your passion the same thing.\n\n1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:35.360\n Okay. Okay.\n\n1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:38.320\n So that's a similar view.\n\n1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:40.360\n In other words, if you can make your work and your passion,\n\n1:20:40.360 --> 1:20:41.960\n it's just gonna work out great.\n\n1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:45.840\n And then of course, people have different purposes of work.\n\n1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:48.640\n And I don't wanna be theoretical about that.\n\n1:20:48.640 --> 1:20:51.000\n People have to take care of their family.\n\n1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:54.920\n So money at a certain point is the base,\n\n1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:57.680\n is an important component of that work.\n\n1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:00.160\n So you look beyond that, what is the money gonna get you\n\n1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:02.040\n and what are you trying to achieve?\n\n1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:04.800\n But the most important thing, I agree,\n\n1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:07.640\n is meaningful work and meaningful relationships.\n\n1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:10.360\n Like if you can get into the thing that you're at,\n\n1:21:10.360 --> 1:21:12.480\n your mission that you're on,\n\n1:21:12.480 --> 1:21:15.800\n and you are excited about that mission that you're on.\n\n1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:18.360\n And then you can do that with people\n\n1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:21.920\n who you have the meaningful relationships with.\n\n1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:25.320\n You have meaningful work and meaningful relationships.\n\n1:21:25.320 --> 1:21:28.960\n I mean, that is fabulous for most people.\n\n1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:34.640\n And it seems that many people struggle to get there,\n\n1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:39.040\n not out of, not necessarily because they're constrained\n\n1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:41.280\n by the fact that they have the financial constraints\n\n1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:45.760\n of having to provide for their family and so on.\n\n1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:50.120\n But it's, I mean, this idea is out there\n\n1:21:50.120 --> 1:21:51.880\n that there needs to be a work life balance,\n\n1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:54.240\n which means that most people,\n\n1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:56.240\n we're gonna return to the same things,\n\n1:21:56.240 --> 1:21:57.800\n most doesn't mean optimal,\n\n1:21:57.800 --> 1:22:01.920\n but most people seem to not be doing their life's passion,\n\n1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:04.960\n not unifying work and passion.\n\n1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:06.240\n Why do you think that is?\n\n1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:08.760\n Well, the work life balance,\n\n1:22:08.760 --> 1:22:12.000\n there's a life arc that you go through.\n\n1:22:12.920 --> 1:22:17.920\n Starts at zero and ends somewhere in the vicinity of 80,\n\n1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:19.080\n and there is a phase.\n\n1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:22.280\n And you could look at the different degrees of happiness\n\n1:22:22.280 --> 1:22:23.880\n that happen in those phases.\n\n1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:25.600\n I can go through that if that was interesting,\n\n1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.640\n but we don't have time probably for it.\n\n1:22:27.640 --> 1:22:30.160\n But you get in the part of the life,\n\n1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:32.600\n that part of the life,\n\n1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:37.600\n which has the lowest level of happiness is age 45 to 55.\n\n1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:43.600\n And because as you move into this second phase of your life,\n\n1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.360\n now the first phase of your life\n\n1:22:46.360 --> 1:22:48.920\n is when you're learning dependent on others.\n\n1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:51.680\n Second phase of your life is when you're working\n\n1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:53.440\n and others are dependent on you\n\n1:22:53.440 --> 1:22:55.560\n and you're trying to be successful.\n\n1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:58.120\n And in that phase of one's life,\n\n1:22:58.120 --> 1:23:01.360\n you encounter the work life balance challenge\n\n1:23:01.360 --> 1:23:04.000\n because you're trying to be successful at work\n\n1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:05.560\n and successful at parenting\n\n1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:08.440\n and successful and successful in all those things\n\n1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:10.080\n that take your demand.\n\n1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:11.240\n And they get into that.\n\n1:23:11.240 --> 1:23:15.320\n And I understand that problem in the work life balance.\n\n1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:20.080\n The issue is primarily to know how to approach that, okay?\n\n1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:24.160\n So I understand it's stressful, it produces stress\n\n1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:25.680\n and it produces bad results\n\n1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:28.080\n and it produces the lowest level of happiness.\n\n1:23:28.080 --> 1:23:29.120\n In one's life.\n\n1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:31.880\n It's interesting as you get later in life,\n\n1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:33.760\n the levels of happiness rise\n\n1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:35.880\n and the highest level of happiness\n\n1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:37.640\n is between ages 70 and 80,\n\n1:23:37.640 --> 1:23:39.440\n which is interesting for other reasons.\n\n1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:41.400\n But in that spot,\n\n1:23:41.400 --> 1:23:44.400\n and the key to work life balance\n\n1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:49.000\n is to realize and to learn\n\n1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.760\n how to get more out of an hour of life, okay?\n\n1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:56.840\n Because an hour of work,\n\n1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:00.560\n what people are thinking is that they have to make a choice\n\n1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:02.520\n between one thing and another.\n\n1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.720\n And of course they do.\n\n1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:08.320\n But they don't realize that if they develop the skill\n\n1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:11.320\n to get a lot more out of an hour,\n\n1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:14.680\n it's the equivalent of having many more hours in your life.\n\n1:24:14.680 --> 1:24:17.480\n And so, that's why in the book principles,\n\n1:24:17.480 --> 1:24:19.360\n I try to go into, okay, now,\n\n1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.320\n how can you get a lot more out of an hour?\n\n1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:25.920\n That allows you to get more life into your life\n\n1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:28.040\n and it reduces the work life balance.\n\n1:24:28.040 --> 1:24:31.600\n And that's the primary struggle in that 35 to 45.\n\n1:24:32.920 --> 1:24:35.120\n If you could linger on that,\n\n1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:37.880\n so what are the ups and downs of life\n\n1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:39.960\n in terms of happiness in general\n\n1:24:39.960 --> 1:24:42.960\n and perhaps in your own life\n\n1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:46.600\n when you look back at the moments, the peaks?\n\n1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:50.040\n It's pretty much the same pattern.\n\n1:24:50.040 --> 1:24:54.400\n Early in one's life tends to be a very happy period,\n\n1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:58.800\n all the way up and 16 is like a really great happy,\n\n1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:03.400\n I think like myself, you start to get elements of freedom,\n\n1:25:03.400 --> 1:25:07.680\n you get your driver's license, whatever, but 16 is there.\n\n1:25:08.720 --> 1:25:10.560\n Junior year in high school quite often\n\n1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:11.760\n could be a stressful period\n\n1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:13.760\n to try to get thinking about the high school.\n\n1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:15.280\n You go into college,\n\n1:25:15.280 --> 1:25:18.440\n tends to be very hot happiness, generally speaking.\n\n1:25:18.440 --> 1:25:19.280\n Freedom.\n\n1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:22.600\n And then freedom, friendships, all of that.\n\n1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:24.200\n Freedom is a big thing.\n\n1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:29.200\n And then 23 is a peak point kind of in happiness,\n\n1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:31.680\n that freedom.\n\n1:25:31.680 --> 1:25:35.000\n Then sequentially, one has a great time,\n\n1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.600\n they date, they go out and so on,\n\n1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:38.920\n you find the love of your life,\n\n1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:41.560\n you begin to develop a family.\n\n1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:44.400\n And then with that, as time happens,\n\n1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:48.040\n you have more of your work life balance challenges\n\n1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:50.120\n that come in your responsibilities.\n\n1:25:50.120 --> 1:25:53.920\n And then as you get there in that mid part of your life,\n\n1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:56.520\n that is the biggest struggle.\n\n1:25:56.520 --> 1:26:00.040\n Chances are you will crash in that period of time,\n\n1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:02.440\n you'll have your series of failures,\n\n1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:05.520\n that's when you go into the abyss,\n\n1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:09.000\n you learn, you hopefully learn from those mistakes,\n\n1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.440\n you have the metamorphosis, you come out, you change,\n\n1:26:12.440 --> 1:26:14.520\n you hopefully become better\n\n1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:17.240\n and you take more responsibilities and so on.\n\n1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:20.760\n And then when you get to the later part,\n\n1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:24.560\n as you are starting to approach the transition\n\n1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:28.560\n in that late part of the second phase of your life,\n\n1:26:28.560 --> 1:26:31.200\n before you go into the third phase of your life,\n\n1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:33.800\n second phase is you're working, trying to be successful.\n\n1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:37.640\n Third phase of your life is you want people\n\n1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:40.480\n to be successful without you, okay?\n\n1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:43.920\n You want your kids to be successful without you\n\n1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:46.400\n because when you're at that phase,\n\n1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.640\n they're at making their transition\n\n1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:50.560\n from the first phase to the second phase\n\n1:26:50.560 --> 1:26:52.000\n and they're trying to be successful\n\n1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:53.920\n and you want them to be successful without you\n\n1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:58.680\n and your parents are gone and then you have freedom\n\n1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:00.640\n and then you have freedom again.\n\n1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:03.720\n And with that freedom and then you have these,\n\n1:27:03.720 --> 1:27:06.760\n history has shown with this, you have friendships,\n\n1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:09.640\n you have perspective on life, you have different things\n\n1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.080\n and that's one of the reasons\n\n1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:13.720\n that that later part of the life can be real.\n\n1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:16.160\n On average, actually, it's the highest.\n\n1:27:16.160 --> 1:27:19.840\n Very interesting thing, there are surveys\n\n1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:24.560\n and say, how good do you look and how good do you feel?\n\n1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:28.360\n And that's the highest survey.\n\n1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:30.400\n Now, they're not looking the best\n\n1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:32.160\n and they're not feeling the best, right?\n\n1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:35.080\n Maybe it's 35 that they're actually looking the best\n\n1:27:35.080 --> 1:27:38.520\n and feeling the best, but they rank the highest\n\n1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:41.080\n at that point, survey results of being the highest\n\n1:27:41.080 --> 1:27:44.200\n in that 70 to 80 period of time\n\n1:27:44.200 --> 1:27:47.200\n because it has to do with an attitude on life.\n\n1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:48.960\n Then you start to have grandkids,\n\n1:27:48.960 --> 1:27:50.760\n oh, grandkids are great\n\n1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:54.680\n and you start to experience that transition well.\n\n1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.800\n So that's what the arc of life pretty much looks like\n\n1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:00.920\n and I'm experiencing it.\n\n1:28:00.920 --> 1:28:02.360\n You've lived it.\n\n1:28:02.360 --> 1:28:05.760\n When you meditate, we're all human, we're all mortal.\n\n1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.600\n When you meditate on your own mortality,\n\n1:28:09.600 --> 1:28:14.600\n having achieved a lot of success on whatever dimension,\n\n1:28:14.600 --> 1:28:17.040\n what do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:22.040\n The meaning of our short existence on earth as human beings?\n\n1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.120\n I think that evolution is the greatest force\n\n1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:30.120\n of the universe and that we're all tiny bits\n\n1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:33.480\n of an evolutionary type of process\n\n1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:38.000\n where it's just matter and machines that go through time\n\n1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:43.000\n and that we all have a deeply embedded inclination\n\n1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:48.000\n to evolve and contribute to evolution.\n\n1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:52.000\n So I think it's to personally evolve\n\n1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.260\n and contribute to evolution.\n\n1:28:54.260 --> 1:28:56.200\n I could have predicted you would answer that way.\n\n1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:58.320\n It's brilliant and exactly right.\n\n1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:02.920\n And I think we've said it before, but I'll say it again.\n\n1:29:02.920 --> 1:29:05.440\n You have a lot of incredible videos out there\n\n1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:07.520\n that people should definitely watch.\n\n1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:08.780\n I don't say this often.\n\n1:29:08.780 --> 1:29:11.560\n I mean, it's literally the best spend of time\n\n1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.000\n and in terms of reading principles\n\n1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.120\n and reading basically anything you write on LinkedIn\n\n1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:18.480\n and so on is a really good use of time.\n\n1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.640\n It's a lot of light bulb moments,\n\n1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.680\n a lot of transformative ideas in there.\n\n1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:24.800\n So Ray, thank you so much.\n\n1:29:24.800 --> 1:29:25.640\n It's been an honor.\n\n1:29:25.640 --> 1:29:26.640\n I really appreciate it.\n\n1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:28.080\n It's been a pleasure for me too.\n\n1:29:28.080 --> 1:29:31.340\n I'm happy to hear it's a use to you and others.\n\n1:29:32.840 --> 1:29:35.920\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ray
