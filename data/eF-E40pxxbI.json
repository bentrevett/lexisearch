the lion's kinetic energy and is it optimal\n\n00:08.040 --> 00:10.440\n to go this way or that way, you just react it.\n\n00:10.440 --> 00:13.240\n And physically our bodies are well attuned\n\n00:13.240 --> 00:14.540\n to actually make right decisions.\n\n00:14.540 --> 00:16.640\n But when you're playing a game like poker,\n\n00:16.640 --> 00:19.320\n this is not something that you ever evolved to do.\n\n00:19.320 --> 00:22.360\n And yet you're in that same flight or fight response.\n\n00:22.360 --> 00:24.440\n And so that's a really important skill\n\n00:24.440 --> 00:25.900\n to be able to develop to basically learn\n\n00:25.900 --> 00:29.100\n how to like meditate in the moment and calm yourself\n\n00:29.100 --> 00:30.600\n so that you can think clearly.\n\n00:32.520 --> 00:35.740\n The following is a conversation with Liv Burry,\n\n00:35.740 --> 00:38.380\n formerly one of the best poker players in the world,\n\n00:38.380 --> 00:42.880\n trained as an astrophysicist and is now a philanthropist\n\n00:42.880 --> 00:45.780\n and an educator on topics of game theory,\n\n00:45.780 --> 00:48.280\n physics, complexity, and life.\n\n00:49.120 --> 00:51.080\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:51.080 --> 00:53.200\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:53.200 --> 00:54.440\n in the description.\n\n00:54.440 --> 00:57.680\n And now, dear friends, here's Liv Burry.\n\n00:57.680 --> 01:02.580\n What role do you think luck plays in poker and in life?\n\n01:02.580 --> 01:04.260\n You can pick whichever one you want,\n\n01:04.260 --> 01:06.940\n poker or life and or life.\n\n01:06.940 --> 01:10.900\n The longer you play, the less influence luck has.\n\n01:10.900 --> 01:13.900\n Like with all things, the bigger your sample size,\n\n01:13.900 --> 01:16.380\n the more the quality of your decisions\n\n01:16.380 --> 01:17.940\n or your strategies matter.\n\n01:18.860 --> 01:21.580\n So to answer that question, yeah, in poker,\n\n01:21.580 --> 01:22.780\n it really depends.\n\n01:22.780 --> 01:26.120\n If you and I sat and played 10 hands right now,\n\n01:26.120 --> 01:30.260\n I might only win 52% of the time, 53% maybe.\n\n01:30.260 --> 01:31.740\n But if we played 10,000 hands,\n\n01:31.740 --> 01:35.180\n then I'll probably win like over 98, 99% of the time.\n\n01:35.180 --> 01:38.180\n So it's a question of sample sizes.\n\n01:38.180 --> 01:40.120\n And what are you figuring out over time?\n\n01:40.120 --> 01:42.260\n The betting strategy that this individual does\n\n01:42.260 --> 01:43.740\n or literally it doesn't matter\n\n01:43.740 --> 01:45.920\n against any individual over time?\n\n01:45.920 --> 01:47.980\n Against any individual over time, the better player\n\n01:47.980 --> 01:49.520\n because they're making better decisions.\n\n01:49.520 --> 01:51.260\n So what does that mean to make a better decision?\n\n01:51.260 --> 01:55.340\n Well, to get into the realness of Gritty already,\n\n01:55.340 --> 01:57.820\n basically poker is a game of math.\n\n01:58.780 --> 02:00.380\n There are these strategies familiar\n\n02:00.380 --> 02:02.580\n with like Nash Equilibria, right?\n\n02:02.580 --> 02:06.340\n So there are these game theory optimal strategies\n\n02:06.340 --> 02:08.340\n that you can adopt.\n\n02:08.340 --> 02:10.380\n And the closer you play to them,\n\n02:10.380 --> 02:12.420\n the less exploitable you are.\n\n02:12.420 --> 02:15.980\n So because I've studied the game a bunch,\n\n02:15.980 --> 02:17.300\n although admittedly not for a few years,\n\n02:17.300 --> 02:20.060\n but back when I was playing all the time,\n\n02:20.060 --> 02:23.060\n I would study these game theory optimal solutions\n\n02:23.060 --> 02:24.940\n and try and then adopt those strategies\n\n02:24.940 --> 02:25.780\n when I go and play.\n\n02:25.780 --> 02:27.760\n So I'd play against you and I would do that.\n\n02:27.760 --> 02:31.860\n And because the objective,\n\n02:31.860 --> 02:33.260\n when you're playing game theory optimal,\n\n02:33.260 --> 02:36.020\n it's actually, it's a loss minimization thing\n\n02:36.020 --> 02:37.380\n that you're trying to do.\n\n02:37.380 --> 02:42.380\n Your best bet is to try and play a sort of similar style.\n\n02:42.760 --> 02:46.220\n You also need to try and adopt this loss minimization.\n\n02:46.220 --> 02:48.140\n But because I've been playing much longer than you,\n\n02:48.140 --> 02:49.420\n I'll be better at that.\n\n02:49.420 --> 02:51.940\n So first of all, you're not taking advantage\n\n02:51.940 --> 02:53.180\n of my mistakes.\n\n02:53.180 --> 02:55.020\n But then on top of that,\n\n02:55.020 --> 02:56.940\n I'll be better at recognizing\n\n02:56.940 --> 02:59.540\n when you are playing suboptimally\n\n02:59.540 --> 03:02.220\n and then deviating from this game theory optimal strategy\n\n03:02.220 --> 03:05.140\n to exploit your bad plays.\n\n03:05.140 --> 03:08.700\n Can you define game theory and Nash equilibria?\n\n03:08.700 --> 03:10.980\n Can we try to sneak up to it in a bunch of ways?\n\n03:10.980 --> 03:14.380\n Like what's a game theory framework of analyzing poker,\n\n03:14.380 --> 03:16.340\n analyzing any kind of situation?\n\n03:16.340 --> 03:21.340\n So game theory is just basically the study of decisions\n\n03:21.340 --> 03:24.540\n within a competitive situation.\n\n03:24.540 --> 03:26.780\n I mean, it's technically a branch of economics,\n\n03:26.780 --> 03:30.380\n but it also applies to like wider decision theory.\n\n03:30.380 --> 03:35.380\n And usually when you see it,\n\n03:35.380 --> 03:37.900\n it's these like little payoff matrices and so on.\n\n03:37.900 --> 03:38.780\n That's how it's depicted.\n\n03:38.780 --> 03:41.140\n But it's essentially just like study of strategies\n\n03:41.140 --> 03:42.940\n under different competitive situations.\n\n03:42.940 --> 03:46.360\n And as it happens, certain games,\n\n03:46.360 --> 03:48.820\n in fact, many, many games have these things\n\n03:48.820 --> 03:50.460\n called Nash equilibria.\n\n03:50.460 --> 03:52.420\n And what that means is when you're in a Nash equilibrium,\n\n03:52.420 --> 03:55.460\n basically it is not,\n\n03:55.460 --> 03:59.700\n there is no strategy that you can take\n\n03:59.700 --> 04:01.180\n that would be more beneficial\n\n04:01.180 --> 04:02.780\n than the one you're currently taking,\n\n04:02.780 --> 04:05.700\n assuming your opponent is also doing the same thing.\n\n04:05.700 --> 04:06.740\n So it'd be a bad idea,\n\n04:06.740 --> 04:10.660\n if we're both playing in a game theory optimal strategy,\n\n04:10.660 --> 04:12.140\n if either of us deviate from that,\n\n04:12.140 --> 04:16.620\n now we're putting ourselves at a disadvantage.\n\n04:16.620 --> 04:17.460\n Rock, paper, scissors\n\n04:17.460 --> 04:18.840\n is actually a really great example of this.\n\n04:18.840 --> 04:22.380\n Like if we were to start playing rock, paper, scissors,\n\n04:22.380 --> 04:23.740\n you know, you know nothing about me\n\n04:23.740 --> 04:26.180\n and we're gonna play for all our money,\n\n04:26.180 --> 04:27.820\n let's play 10 rounds of it.\n\n04:27.820 --> 04:30.220\n What would your sort of optimal strategy be?\n\n04:30.220 --> 04:31.860\n Do you think, what would you do?\n\n04:33.640 --> 04:35.180\n Let's see.\n\n04:35.180 --> 04:40.180\n I would probably try to be as random as possible.\n\n04:42.580 --> 04:43.500\n Exactly.\n\n04:43.500 --> 04:46.000\n You wanna, because you don't know anything about me,\n\n04:46.000 --> 04:48.100\n you don't want to give anything away about yourself.\n\n04:48.100 --> 04:49.540\n So ideally you'd have like a little dice\n\n04:49.540 --> 04:52.560\n or somewhat, you know, perfect randomizer\n\n04:52.560 --> 04:54.500\n that makes you randomize 33% of the time\n\n04:54.500 --> 04:56.060\n each of the three different things.\n\n04:56.060 --> 04:58.140\n And in response to that,\n\n04:58.140 --> 04:59.620\n well, actually I can kind of do anything,\n\n04:59.620 --> 05:01.380\n but I would probably just randomize back too,\n\n05:01.380 --> 05:02.400\n but actually it wouldn't matter\n\n05:02.400 --> 05:05.140\n because I know that you're playing randomly.\n\n05:05.140 --> 05:07.620\n So that would be us in a Nash equilibrium\n\n05:07.620 --> 05:10.620\n where we're both playing this like unexploitable strategy.\n\n05:10.620 --> 05:13.020\n However, if after a while you then notice\n\n05:13.020 --> 05:16.380\n that I'm playing rock a little bit more often than I should.\n\n05:16.380 --> 05:18.140\n Yeah, you're the kind of person that would do that,\n\n05:18.140 --> 05:18.980\n wouldn't you?\n\n05:18.980 --> 05:19.800\n Sure.\n\n05:19.800 --> 05:20.640\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n05:20.640 --> 05:21.460\n I'm more of a scissors girl, but anyway.\n\n05:21.460 --> 05:22.500\n You are?\n\n05:22.500 --> 05:24.420\n No, I'm a, as I said, randomizer.\n\n05:25.580 --> 05:27.140\n So you notice I'm throwing rock too much\n\n05:27.140 --> 05:28.140\n or something like that.\n\n05:28.140 --> 05:29.300\n Now you'd be making a mistake\n\n05:29.300 --> 05:32.180\n by continuing playing this game theory optimal strategy,\n\n05:32.180 --> 05:35.420\n well, the previous one, because you are now,\n\n05:36.660 --> 05:39.060\n I'm making a mistake and you're not deviating\n\n05:39.060 --> 05:41.300\n and exploiting my mistake.\n\n05:41.300 --> 05:43.800\n So you'd want to start throwing paper a bit more often\n\n05:43.800 --> 05:45.940\n in whatever you figure is the right sort of percentage\n\n05:45.940 --> 05:48.060\n of the time that I'm throwing rock too often.\n\n05:48.060 --> 05:51.460\n So that's basically an example of where,\n\n05:51.460 --> 05:53.260\n what game theory optimal strategy is\n\n05:53.260 --> 05:54.660\n in terms of loss minimization,\n\n05:54.660 --> 05:58.020\n but it's not always the maximally profitable thing\n\n05:58.020 --> 06:00.140\n if your opponent is doing stupid stuff,\n\n06:00.140 --> 06:02.560\n which in that example.\n\n06:02.560 --> 06:04.500\n So that's kind of then how it works in poker,\n\n06:04.500 --> 06:06.420\n but it's a lot more complex.\n\n06:07.380 --> 06:10.620\n And the way poker players typically,\n\n06:10.620 --> 06:12.900\n nowadays they study, the games change so much.\n\n06:12.900 --> 06:15.420\n And I think we should talk about how it sort of evolved,\n\n06:15.420 --> 06:17.780\n but nowadays like the top pros\n\n06:17.780 --> 06:20.820\n basically spend all their time in between sessions\n\n06:20.820 --> 06:24.220\n running these simulators using like software\n\n06:24.220 --> 06:26.140\n where they do basically Monte Carlo simulations,\n\n06:26.140 --> 06:31.140\n sort of doing billions of fictitious self play hands.\n\n06:31.140 --> 06:34.020\n You input a fictitious hand scenario,\n\n06:34.020 --> 06:36.060\n like, oh, what do I do with Jack nine suited\n\n06:36.060 --> 06:40.340\n on a King 10 four to two spades board\n\n06:41.980 --> 06:43.940\n and against this bet size.\n\n06:43.940 --> 06:45.780\n So you'd input that press play,\n\n06:45.780 --> 06:49.340\n it'll run its billions of fake hands\n\n06:49.340 --> 06:50.340\n and then it will converge upon\n\n06:50.340 --> 06:52.540\n what the game theory optimal strategies are.\n\n06:53.460 --> 06:55.420\n And then you wanna try and memorize what these are.\n\n06:55.420 --> 06:57.480\n Basically they're like ratios of how often,\n\n06:57.480 --> 06:59.900\n what types of hands you want to bluff\n\n06:59.900 --> 07:01.300\n and what percentage of the time.\n\n07:01.300 --> 07:02.780\n So then there's this additional layer\n\n07:02.780 --> 07:04.460\n of inbuilt randomization built in.\n\n07:04.460 --> 07:06.420\n Yeah, those kinds of simulations incorporate\n\n07:06.420 --> 07:09.460\n all the betting strategies and everything else like that.\n\n07:09.460 --> 07:12.340\n So as opposed to some kind of very crude mathematical model\n\n07:12.340 --> 07:13.860\n of what's the probability you win\n\n07:13.860 --> 07:16.380\n just based on the quality of the card,\n\n07:16.380 --> 07:18.980\n it's including everything else too.\n\n07:18.980 --> 07:20.220\n The game theory of it.\n\n07:20.220 --> 07:21.980\n Yes, yeah, essentially.\n\n07:21.980 --> 07:23.780\n And what's interesting is that nowadays,\n\n07:23.780 --> 07:25.620\n if you want to be a top pro and you go and play\n\n07:25.620 --> 07:27.540\n in these really like the super high stakes tournaments\n\n07:27.540 --> 07:30.700\n or tough cash games, if you don't know this stuff,\n\n07:30.700 --> 07:33.260\n you're gonna get eaten alive in the long run.\n\n07:33.260 --> 07:35.160\n But of course you could get lucky over the short run\n\n07:35.160 --> 07:36.860\n and that's where this like luck factor comes in\n\n07:36.860 --> 07:40.400\n because luck is both a blessing and a curse.\n\n07:40.400 --> 07:42.580\n If luck didn't, if there wasn't this random element\n\n07:42.580 --> 07:45.260\n and there wasn't the ability for worse players\n\n07:45.260 --> 07:48.220\n to win sometimes, then poker would fall apart.\n\n07:48.220 --> 07:50.980\n You know, the same reason people don't play chess\n\n07:50.980 --> 07:53.380\n professionally for money against,\n\n07:53.380 --> 07:55.500\n you don't see people going and hustling chess\n\n07:55.500 --> 07:57.860\n like not knowing, trying to make a living from it\n\n07:57.860 --> 08:00.140\n because you know there's very little luck in chess,\n\n08:00.140 --> 08:01.420\n but there's quite a lot of luck in poker.\n\n08:01.420 --> 08:03.940\n Have you seen Beautiful Mind, that movie?\n\n08:03.940 --> 08:04.780\n Years ago.\n\n08:04.780 --> 08:07.220\n Well, what do you think about the game theoretic formulation\n\n08:07.220 --> 08:09.980\n of what is it, the hot blonde at the bar?\n\n08:09.980 --> 08:10.820\n Do you remember?\n\n08:10.820 --> 08:11.660\n Oh, yeah.\n\n08:11.660 --> 08:14.860\n What they illustrated is they're trying to pick up a girl\n\n08:14.860 --> 08:16.460\n at a bar and there's multiple girls.\n\n08:16.460 --> 08:18.140\n They're like friend, it's like a friend group\n\n08:18.140 --> 08:20.100\n and you're trying to approach,\n\n08:20.100 --> 08:21.980\n I don't remember the details, but I remember.\n\n08:21.980 --> 08:24.340\n Don't you like then speak to her friends first\n\n08:24.340 --> 08:25.700\n or something like that, feign disinterest.\n\n08:25.700 --> 08:27.420\n I mean, it's classic pickup artist stuff, right?\n\n08:27.420 --> 08:28.260\n You wanna.\n\n08:28.260 --> 08:30.780\n And they were trying to correlate that somehow,\n\n08:30.780 --> 08:35.360\n that being an optimal strategy game theoretically.\n\n08:35.360 --> 08:36.740\n Why?\n\n08:36.740 --> 08:38.940\n What, what, like, I don't think, I remember.\n\n08:38.940 --> 08:39.780\n I can't imagine that there is,\n\n08:39.780 --> 08:41.940\n I mean, there's probably an optimal strategy.\n\n08:41.940 --> 08:45.020\n Is it, does that mean that there's an actual Nash equilibrium\n\n08:45.020 --> 08:46.660\n of like picking up girls?\n\n08:46.660 --> 08:49.020\n Do you know the marriage problem?\n\n08:49.020 --> 08:50.940\n It's optimal stopping.\n\n08:50.940 --> 08:51.780\n Yes.\n\n08:51.780 --> 08:54.180\n So where it's an optimal dating strategy\n\n08:54.180 --> 08:56.580\n where you, do you remember what it is?\n\n08:56.580 --> 08:57.580\n Yeah, I think it's like something like,\n\n08:57.580 --> 08:59.920\n you know you've got like a set of a hundred people\n\n08:59.920 --> 09:01.900\n you're gonna look through and after,\n\n09:01.900 --> 09:05.620\n how many do you, now after that,\n\n09:05.620 --> 09:08.020\n after going on this many dates out of a hundred,\n\n09:08.020 --> 09:10.780\n at what point do you then go, okay, the next best person I see,\n\n09:10.780 --> 09:11.620\n is that the right one?\n\n09:11.620 --> 09:14.700\n And I think it's like something like 37%.\n\n09:14.700 --> 09:17.740\n Uh, it's one over E, whatever that is.\n\n09:17.740 --> 09:19.260\n Right, which I think is 37%.\n\n09:19.260 --> 09:20.100\n Yeah.\n\n09:21.260 --> 09:22.860\n We're gonna fact check that.\n\n09:24.860 --> 09:25.700\n Yeah.\n\n09:25.700 --> 09:28.420\n So, but it's funny under those strict constraints,\n\n09:28.420 --> 09:30.660\n then yes, after that many people,\n\n09:30.660 --> 09:32.900\n as long as you have a fixed size pool,\n\n09:32.900 --> 09:36.460\n then you just pick the next person\n\n09:36.460 --> 09:38.460\n that is better than anyone you've seen before.\n\n09:38.460 --> 09:40.340\n Anyone else you've seen, yeah.\n\n09:40.340 --> 09:41.780\n Have you tried this?\n\n09:41.780 --> 09:42.620\n Have you incorporated it?\n\n09:42.620 --> 09:44.660\n I'm not one of those people.\n\n09:44.660 --> 09:45.820\n And we're gonna discuss this.\n\n09:45.820 --> 09:49.820\n I, and, what do you mean, those people?\n\n09:49.820 --> 09:52.560\n I try not to optimize stuff.\n\n09:52.560 --> 09:55.300\n I try to listen to the heart.\n\n09:55.300 --> 09:59.780\n I don't think, I like,\n\n09:59.780 --> 10:04.300\n my mind immediately is attracted to optimizing everything.\n\n10:04.300 --> 10:06.220\n Optimizing everything.\n\n10:06.220 --> 10:09.900\n And I think that if you really give in\n\n10:09.900 --> 10:11.060\n to that kind of addiction,\n\n10:11.060 --> 10:14.880\n that you lose the joy of the small things,\n\n10:14.880 --> 10:17.180\n the minutiae of life, I think.\n\n10:17.180 --> 10:18.020\n I don't know.\n\n10:18.020 --> 10:19.780\n I'm concerned about the addictive nature\n\n10:19.780 --> 10:21.600\n of my personality in that regard.\n\n10:21.600 --> 10:22.740\n In some ways,\n\n10:24.760 --> 10:26.520\n while I think the, on average,\n\n10:26.520 --> 10:30.140\n people under try and quantify things,\n\n10:30.140 --> 10:32.500\n or try, under optimize.\n\n10:32.500 --> 10:34.100\n There are some people who, you know,\n\n10:34.100 --> 10:37.140\n with all these things, it's a balancing act.\n\n10:37.140 --> 10:40.180\n I've been on dating apps, but I've never used them.\n\n10:40.180 --> 10:42.060\n I'm sure they have data on this,\n\n10:42.060 --> 10:43.060\n because they probably have\n\n10:43.060 --> 10:45.260\n the optimal stopping control problem.\n\n10:45.260 --> 10:47.380\n Because there aren't a lot of people that use social,\n\n10:47.380 --> 10:51.020\n like dating apps, are on there for a long time.\n\n10:51.020 --> 10:56.020\n So the interesting aspect is like, all right,\n\n10:56.300 --> 10:58.740\n how long before you stop looking\n\n10:58.740 --> 11:01.720\n before it actually starts affecting your mind negatively,\n\n11:01.720 --> 11:05.080\n such that you see dating as a kind of,\n\n11:07.380 --> 11:08.220\n A game.\n\n11:08.220 --> 11:12.780\n A kind of game versus an actual process\n\n11:12.780 --> 11:14.420\n of finding somebody that's going to make you happy\n\n11:14.420 --> 11:15.780\n for the rest of your life.\n\n11:15.780 --> 11:17.340\n That's really interesting.\n\n11:17.340 --> 11:18.180\n They have the data.\n\n11:18.180 --> 11:20.420\n I wish they would be able to release that data.\n\n11:20.420 --> 11:21.260\n And I do want to hop to it.\n\n11:21.260 --> 11:22.220\n It's OkCupid, right?\n\n11:22.220 --> 11:25.320\n I think they ran a huge, huge study on all of that.\n\n11:25.320 --> 11:28.060\n Yeah, they're more data driven, I think, OkCupid folks are.\n\n11:28.060 --> 11:30.220\n I think there's a lot of opportunity for dating apps,\n\n11:30.220 --> 11:32.340\n in general, even bigger than dating apps,\n\n11:32.340 --> 11:35.020\n people connecting on the internet.\n\n11:35.020 --> 11:37.580\n I just hope they're more data driven.\n\n11:37.580 --> 11:40.340\n And it doesn't seem that way.\n\n11:40.340 --> 11:43.380\n I think like, I've always thought that\n\n11:44.780 --> 11:47.900\n Goodreads should be a dating app.\n\n11:47.900 --> 11:48.740\n Like the.\n\n11:48.740 --> 11:49.580\n I've never used it.\n\n11:49.580 --> 11:50.400\n After what?\n\n11:50.400 --> 11:55.140\n Goodreads is just lists like books that you've read.\n\n11:55.140 --> 11:57.360\n And allows you to comment on the books you read\n\n11:57.360 --> 11:58.940\n and what books you're currently reading.\n\n11:58.940 --> 12:01.340\n But it's a giant social networks of people reading books.\n\n12:01.340 --> 12:03.380\n And that seems to be a much better database\n\n12:03.380 --> 12:04.620\n of like interests.\n\n12:04.620 --> 12:06.580\n Of course it constrains you to the books you're reading,\n\n12:06.580 --> 12:10.220\n but like that really reveals so much more about the person.\n\n12:10.220 --> 12:12.460\n Allows you to discover shared interests\n\n12:12.460 --> 12:13.940\n because books are a kind of window\n\n12:13.940 --> 12:16.020\n into the way you see the world.\n\n12:16.020 --> 12:19.220\n Also like the kind of places,\n\n12:19.220 --> 12:20.340\n people you're curious about,\n\n12:20.340 --> 12:21.700\n the kind of ideas you're curious about.\n\n12:21.700 --> 12:24.860\n Are you a romantic or are you cold calculating rationalist?\n\n12:24.860 --> 12:28.260\n Are you into Ayn Rand or are you into Bernie Sanders?\n\n12:28.260 --> 12:29.940\n Are you into whatever?\n\n12:29.940 --> 12:31.980\n And I feel like that reveals so much more\n\n12:31.980 --> 12:35.220\n than like a person trying to look hot\n\n12:35.220 --> 12:37.100\n from a certain angle in a Tinder profile.\n\n12:37.100 --> 12:38.940\n Well, and it'd also be a really great filter\n\n12:38.940 --> 12:40.340\n in the first place for people.\n\n12:40.340 --> 12:41.940\n It's less people who read books\n\n12:41.940 --> 12:44.700\n and are willing to go and rate them\n\n12:44.700 --> 12:47.020\n and give feedback on them and so on.\n\n12:47.020 --> 12:48.820\n So that's already a really strong filter.\n\n12:48.820 --> 12:50.600\n Probably the type of people you'd be looking for.\n\n12:50.600 --> 12:52.380\n Well, at least be able to fake reading books.\n\n12:52.380 --> 12:53.540\n I mean, the thing about books,\n\n12:53.540 --> 12:54.500\n you don't really need to read it.\n\n12:54.500 --> 12:55.860\n You can just look at the click counts.\n\n12:55.860 --> 12:59.060\n Yeah, game the dating app by feigning intellectualism.\n\n12:59.060 --> 13:02.340\n Can I admit something very horrible about myself?\n\n13:02.340 --> 13:03.180\n Go on.\n\n13:03.180 --> 13:04.300\n The things that, you know,\n\n13:04.300 --> 13:05.700\n I don't have many things in my closet,\n\n13:05.700 --> 13:06.900\n but this is one of them.\n\n13:07.980 --> 13:10.700\n I've never actually read Shakespeare.\n\n13:10.700 --> 13:12.340\n I've only read Cliff Notes\n\n13:12.340 --> 13:15.020\n and I got a five in the AP English exam.\n\n13:15.020 --> 13:15.860\n Wow.\n\n13:15.860 --> 13:16.700\n And I...\n\n13:16.700 --> 13:18.020\n Which book?\n\n13:18.020 --> 13:19.660\n The which books have I read?\n\n13:19.660 --> 13:21.500\n Oh yeah, which was the exam on which book?\n\n13:21.500 --> 13:23.180\n Oh no, they include a lot of them.\n\n13:23.180 --> 13:24.260\n Oh.\n\n13:24.260 --> 13:27.140\n But Hamlet, I don't even know\n\n13:27.140 --> 13:30.060\n if you read Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth.\n\n13:30.060 --> 13:32.660\n I don't remember, but I don't understand it.\n\n13:32.660 --> 13:34.060\n It's like really cryptic.\n\n13:34.060 --> 13:34.900\n It's hard.\n\n13:34.900 --> 13:37.980\n It's really, I don't, and it's not that pleasant to read.\n\n13:37.980 --> 13:39.180\n It's like ancient speak.\n\n13:39.180 --> 13:40.300\n I don't understand it.\n\n13:40.300 --> 13:41.780\n Anyway, maybe I was too dumb.\n\n13:41.780 --> 13:44.780\n I'm still too dumb, but I did get...\n\n13:44.780 --> 13:45.820\n You got a five, which is...\n\n13:45.820 --> 13:46.660\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n13:46.660 --> 13:47.980\n I don't know how the US grading system...\n\n13:47.980 --> 13:50.380\n Oh no, so AP English is a,\n\n13:50.380 --> 13:53.060\n there's kind of this advanced versions of courses\n\n13:53.060 --> 13:54.900\n in high school, and you take a test\n\n13:54.900 --> 13:57.940\n that is like a broad test for that subject\n\n13:57.940 --> 13:58.900\n and includes a lot.\n\n13:58.900 --> 14:00.580\n It wasn't obviously just Shakespeare.\n\n14:00.580 --> 14:04.900\n I think a lot of it was also writing, written.\n\n14:04.900 --> 14:07.140\n You have like AP Physics, AP Computer Science,\n\n14:07.140 --> 14:11.140\n AP Biology, AP Chemistry, and then AP English\n\n14:11.140 --> 14:13.460\n or AP Literature, I forget what it was.\n\n14:13.460 --> 14:16.020\n But I think Shakespeare was a part of that.\n\n14:16.020 --> 14:16.860\n But I...\n\n14:16.860 --> 14:19.140\n And the point is you gamified it?\n\n14:19.140 --> 14:19.980\n Gamified.\n\n14:19.980 --> 14:22.580\n Well, in entirety, I was into getting As.\n\n14:22.580 --> 14:24.180\n I saw it as a game.\n\n14:24.180 --> 14:25.860\n I don't think any...\n\n14:27.060 --> 14:30.340\n I don't think all of the learning I've done\n\n14:30.340 --> 14:33.940\n has been outside of school.\n\n14:33.940 --> 14:36.220\n The deepest learning I've done has been outside of school\n\n14:36.220 --> 14:38.380\n with a few exceptions, especially in grad school,\n\n14:38.380 --> 14:40.420\n like deep computer science courses.\n\n14:40.420 --> 14:41.780\n But that was still outside of school\n\n14:41.780 --> 14:43.180\n because it was outside of getting...\n\n14:43.180 --> 14:44.020\n Sorry.\n\n14:44.020 --> 14:46.180\n It was outside of getting the A for the course.\n\n14:46.180 --> 14:49.620\n The best stuff I've ever done is when you read the chapter\n\n14:49.620 --> 14:52.300\n and you do many of the problems at the end of the chapter,\n\n14:52.300 --> 14:54.900\n which is usually not what's required for the course,\n\n14:54.900 --> 14:56.140\n like the hardest stuff.\n\n14:56.140 --> 14:58.780\n In fact, textbooks are freaking incredible.\n\n14:58.780 --> 15:02.220\n If you go back now and you look at like biology textbook\n\n15:02.220 --> 15:06.060\n or any of the computer science textbooks\n\n15:06.060 --> 15:07.740\n on algorithms and data structures,\n\n15:07.740 --> 15:09.500\n those things are incredibly...\n\n15:09.500 --> 15:11.940\n They have the best summary of a subject,\n\n15:11.940 --> 15:15.300\n plus they have practice problems of increasing difficulty\n\n15:15.300 --> 15:17.700\n that allows you to truly master the basic,\n\n15:17.700 --> 15:19.900\n like the fundamental ideas behind that.\n\n15:19.900 --> 15:24.380\n I got through my entire physics degree with one textbook\n\n15:24.380 --> 15:26.260\n that was just this really comprehensive one\n\n15:26.260 --> 15:28.620\n that they told us at the beginning of the first year,\n\n15:28.620 --> 15:31.660\n buy this, but you're gonna have to buy 15 other books\n\n15:31.660 --> 15:33.340\n for all your supplementary courses.\n\n15:33.340 --> 15:35.500\n And I was like, every time I was just checked\n\n15:35.500 --> 15:38.020\n to see whether this book covered it and it did.\n\n15:38.020 --> 15:39.820\n And I think I only bought like two or three extra\n\n15:39.820 --> 15:41.900\n and thank God, cause they're super expensive textbooks.\n\n15:41.900 --> 15:44.300\n It's a whole racket they've got going on.\n\n15:44.300 --> 15:45.140\n Yeah, they are.\n\n15:45.140 --> 15:46.220\n They could just...\n\n15:46.220 --> 15:49.500\n You get the right one, it's just like a manual for...\n\n15:49.500 --> 15:51.380\n But what's interesting though,\n\n15:51.380 --> 15:56.380\n is this is the tyranny of having exams and metrics.\n\n15:56.780 --> 15:58.660\n The tyranny of exams and metrics, yes.\n\n15:58.660 --> 16:00.980\n I loved them because I'm very competitive\n\n16:00.980 --> 16:04.020\n and I liked finding ways to gamify things\n\n16:04.020 --> 16:06.380\n and then like sort of dust off my shoulders afterwards\n\n16:06.380 --> 16:07.420\n when I get a good grade\n\n16:07.420 --> 16:09.620\n or be annoyed at myself when I didn't.\n\n16:09.620 --> 16:10.860\n But yeah, you're absolutely right.\n\n16:10.860 --> 16:12.820\n And that the actual...\n\n16:12.820 --> 16:15.700\n How much of that physics knowledge I've retained,\n\n16:15.700 --> 16:19.660\n like I've learned how to cram and study\n\n16:19.660 --> 16:21.340\n and please an examiner,\n\n16:21.340 --> 16:23.980\n but did that give me the deep lasting knowledge\n\n16:23.980 --> 16:24.820\n that I needed?\n\n16:24.820 --> 16:27.020\n I mean, yes and no,\n\n16:27.020 --> 16:30.980\n but really like nothing makes you learn a topic better\n\n16:30.980 --> 16:34.260\n than when you actually then have to teach it yourself.\n\n16:34.260 --> 16:35.860\n Like I'm trying to wrap my teeth\n\n16:35.860 --> 16:38.180\n around this like game theory Moloch stuff right now.\n\n16:38.180 --> 16:43.060\n And there's no exam at the end of it that I can gamify.\n\n16:43.060 --> 16:43.980\n There's no way to gamify\n\n16:43.980 --> 16:45.380\n and sort of like shortcut my way through it.\n\n16:45.380 --> 16:47.260\n I have to understand it so deeply\n\n16:47.260 --> 16:49.660\n from like deep foundational levels\n\n16:49.660 --> 16:50.700\n to then to build upon it\n\n16:50.700 --> 16:52.340\n and then try and explain it to other people.\n\n16:52.340 --> 16:54.460\n And like, you're about to go and do some lectures, right?\n\n16:54.460 --> 16:57.620\n You can't sort of just like,\n\n16:58.620 --> 17:00.660\n you presumably can't rely on the knowledge\n\n17:00.660 --> 17:03.460\n that you got through when you were studying for an exam\n\n17:03.460 --> 17:04.860\n to reteach that.\n\n17:04.860 --> 17:06.860\n Yeah, and especially high level lectures,\n\n17:06.860 --> 17:09.420\n especially the kind of stuff you do on YouTube,\n\n17:09.420 --> 17:12.780\n you're not just regurgitating material.\n\n17:12.780 --> 17:17.780\n You have to think through what is the core idea here.\n\n17:17.940 --> 17:20.780\n And when you do the lectures live especially,\n\n17:20.780 --> 17:23.940\n you have to, there's no second takes.\n\n17:25.020 --> 17:27.100\n That is the luxury you get\n\n17:27.100 --> 17:28.980\n if you're recording a video for YouTube\n\n17:28.980 --> 17:30.220\n or something like that.\n\n17:30.220 --> 17:34.020\n But it definitely is a luxury you shouldn't lean on.\n\n17:35.060 --> 17:37.340\n I've gotten to interact with a few YouTubers\n\n17:37.340 --> 17:39.300\n that lean on that too much.\n\n17:39.300 --> 17:43.380\n And you realize, oh, you've gamified this system\n\n17:43.380 --> 17:46.740\n because you're not really thinking deeply about stuff.\n\n17:46.740 --> 17:48.420\n You're through the edit,\n\n17:48.420 --> 17:52.220\n both written and spoken,\n\n17:52.220 --> 17:53.900\n you're crafting an amazing video,\n\n17:53.900 --> 17:55.460\n but you yourself as a human being\n\n17:55.460 --> 17:57.620\n have not really deeply understood it.\n\n17:57.620 --> 18:00.780\n So live teaching or at least recording video\n\n18:00.780 --> 18:04.700\n with very few takes is a different beast.\n\n18:04.700 --> 18:07.300\n And I think it's the most honest way of doing it,\n\n18:07.300 --> 18:09.420\n like as few takes as possible.\n\n18:09.420 --> 18:10.780\n That's why I'm nervous about this.\n\n18:10.780 --> 18:14.020\n Don't go back and be like, ah, let's do that.\n\n18:14.020 --> 18:15.500\n Don't fuck this up, Liv.\n\n18:17.220 --> 18:18.500\n The tyranny of exams.\n\n18:18.500 --> 18:23.500\n I do think people talk about high school and college\n\n18:24.220 --> 18:27.220\n as a time to do drugs and drink and have fun\n\n18:27.220 --> 18:28.340\n and all this kind of stuff.\n\n18:28.340 --> 18:33.340\n But looking back, of course I did a lot of those things.\n\n18:33.340 --> 18:38.340\n Yes, no, yes, but it's also a time\n\n18:39.020 --> 18:43.620\n when you get to read textbooks or read books\n\n18:43.620 --> 18:48.740\n or learn with all the time in the world.\n\n18:48.740 --> 18:51.740\n You don't have these responsibilities of laundry\n\n18:54.860 --> 18:59.860\n and having to sort of pay for mortgage,\n\n18:59.860 --> 19:03.020\n all that kind of stuff, pay taxes, all this kind of stuff.\n\n19:03.020 --> 19:06.500\n In most cases, there's just so much time in the day\n\n19:06.500 --> 19:09.420\n for learning and you don't realize it at the time\n\n19:09.420 --> 19:11.100\n because at the time it seems like a chore,\n\n19:11.100 --> 19:14.660\n like why the hell does there's so much homework?\n\n19:14.660 --> 19:17.220\n But you never get a chance to do this kind of learning,\n\n19:17.220 --> 19:20.300\n this kind of homework ever again in life,\n\n19:20.300 --> 19:23.860\n unless later in life you really make a big effort out of it.\n\n19:23.860 --> 19:26.780\n Like basically your knowledge gets solidified.\n\n19:26.780 --> 19:28.380\n You don't get to have fun and learn.\n\n19:28.380 --> 19:32.740\n Learning is really fulfilling and really fun\n\n19:32.740 --> 19:33.700\n if you're that kind of person.\n\n19:33.700 --> 19:37.220\n Like some people like, you know,\n\n19:37.220 --> 19:39.940\n like knowledge is not something that they think is fun.\n\n19:39.940 --> 19:43.020\n But if that's the kind of thing that you think is fun,\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:45.620\n that's the time to have fun and do the drugs and drink\n\n19:45.620 --> 19:46.460\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n19:46.460 --> 19:50.780\n But the learning, just going back to those textbooks,\n\n19:50.780 --> 19:52.460\n the hours spent with the textbooks\n\n19:52.460 --> 19:54.420\n is really, really rewarding.\n\n19:54.420 --> 19:56.020\n Do people even use textbooks anymore?\n\n19:56.020 --> 19:56.940\n Yeah. Do you think?\n\n19:56.940 --> 20:00.300\n Kids these days with their TikTok and their...\n\n20:00.300 --> 20:03.940\n Well, not even that, but it's just like so much information,\n\n20:03.940 --> 20:05.260\n really high quality information,\n\n20:05.260 --> 20:07.300\n you know, it's now in digital format online.\n\n20:08.420 --> 20:10.340\n Yeah, but they're not, they are using that,\n\n20:10.340 --> 20:15.340\n but you know, college is still very, there's a curriculum.\n\n20:15.340 --> 20:18.860\n I mean, so much of school is about rigorous study\n\n20:18.860 --> 20:22.820\n of a subject and still on YouTube, that's not there.\n\n20:22.820 --> 20:23.900\n Right. YouTube has,\n\n20:23.900 --> 20:27.700\n YouTube has, Grant Sanderson talks about this.\n\n20:27.700 --> 20:29.180\n He's this math...\n\n20:29.180 --> 20:30.060\n 3Blue1Brown.\n\n20:30.060 --> 20:31.660\n Yeah, 3Blue1Brown.\n\n20:31.660 --> 20:33.860\n He says like, I'm not a math teacher.\n\n20:33.860 --> 20:37.740\n I just take really cool concepts and I inspire people.\n\n20:37.740 --> 20:39.460\n But if you wanna really learn calculus,\n\n20:39.460 --> 20:41.820\n if you wanna really learn linear algebra,\n\n20:41.820 --> 20:43.540\n you should do the textbook.\n\n20:43.540 --> 20:45.220\n You should do that, you know.\n\n20:45.220 --> 20:48.980\n And there's still the textbook industrial complex\n\n20:48.980 --> 20:53.340\n that like charges like $200 for textbook and somehow,\n\n20:53.340 --> 20:54.940\n I don't know, it's ridiculous.\n\n20:56.580 --> 21:00.540\n Well, they're like, oh, sorry, new edition, edition 14.6.\n\n21:00.540 --> 21:02.860\n Sorry, you can't use 14.5 anymore.\n\n21:02.860 --> 21:03.700\n It's like, what's different?\n\n21:03.700 --> 21:05.340\n We've got one paragraph different.\n\n21:05.340 --> 21:08.900\n So we mentioned offline, Daniel Negrano.\n\n21:08.900 --> 21:11.620\n I'm gonna get a chance to talk to him on this podcast.\n\n21:11.620 --> 21:14.380\n And he's somebody that I found fascinating\n\n21:14.380 --> 21:16.540\n in terms of the way he thinks about poker,\n\n21:16.540 --> 21:18.580\n verbalizes the way he thinks about poker,\n\n21:18.580 --> 21:20.180\n the way he plays poker.\n\n21:20.180 --> 21:22.860\n So, and he's still pretty damn good.\n\n21:22.860 --> 21:24.900\n He's been good for a long time.\n\n21:24.900 --> 21:27.300\n So you mentioned that people are running\n\n21:27.300 --> 21:30.540\n these kinds of simulations and the game of poker has changed.\n\n21:30.540 --> 21:33.420\n Do you think he's adapting in this way?\n\n21:33.420 --> 21:36.540\n Like the top pros, do they have to adopt this way?\n\n21:36.540 --> 21:41.540\n Or is there still like over the years,\n\n21:41.700 --> 21:45.300\n you basically develop this gut feeling about,\n\n21:45.300 --> 21:48.580\n like you get to be like good the way,\n\n21:48.580 --> 21:49.780\n like alpha zero is good.\n\n21:49.780 --> 21:54.180\n You look at the board and somehow from the fog\n\n21:54.180 --> 21:55.380\n comes out the right answer.\n\n21:55.380 --> 21:58.020\n Like this is likely what they have.\n\n21:58.020 --> 22:00.460\n This is likely the best way to move.\n\n22:00.460 --> 22:03.100\n And you don't really, you can't really put a finger\n\n22:03.100 --> 22:08.100\n on exactly why, but it just comes from your gut feeling.\n\n22:08.260 --> 22:09.100\n Or no?\n\n22:09.100 --> 22:10.580\n Yes and no.\n\n22:10.580 --> 22:13.860\n So gut feelings are definitely very important.\n\n22:14.740 --> 22:16.980\n You know, that we've got our two,\n\n22:16.980 --> 22:18.180\n you can distill it down to two modes\n\n22:18.180 --> 22:19.100\n of decision making, right?\n\n22:19.100 --> 22:22.180\n You've got your sort of logical linear voice in your head,\n\n22:22.180 --> 22:24.100\n system two, as it's often called,\n\n22:24.100 --> 22:27.300\n and your system one, your gut intuition.\n\n22:29.020 --> 22:32.420\n And historically in poker,\n\n22:32.420 --> 22:34.380\n the very best players were playing\n\n22:34.380 --> 22:35.980\n almost entirely by their gut.\n\n22:37.140 --> 22:39.300\n You know, often they do some kind of inspired play\n\n22:39.300 --> 22:40.500\n and you'd ask them why they do it\n\n22:40.500 --> 22:43.020\n and they wouldn't really be able to explain it.\n\n22:43.020 --> 22:46.500\n And that's not so much because their process\n\n22:46.500 --> 22:48.620\n was unintelligible, but it was more just because\n\n22:48.620 --> 22:51.220\n no one had the language with which to describe\n\n22:51.220 --> 22:52.420\n what optimal strategies were\n\n22:52.420 --> 22:54.340\n because no one really understood how poker worked.\n\n22:54.340 --> 22:57.620\n This was before, you know, we had analysis software.\n\n22:57.620 --> 22:59.940\n You know, no one was writing,\n\n22:59.940 --> 23:01.540\n I guess some people would write down their hands\n\n23:01.540 --> 23:02.740\n in a little notebook,\n\n23:02.740 --> 23:04.620\n but there was no way to assimilate all this data\n\n23:04.620 --> 23:05.980\n and analyze it.\n\n23:05.980 --> 23:08.540\n But then, you know, when computers became cheaper\n\n23:08.540 --> 23:09.980\n and software started emerging,\n\n23:09.980 --> 23:11.540\n and then obviously online poker,\n\n23:11.540 --> 23:14.260\n where it would like automatically save your hand histories.\n\n23:14.260 --> 23:17.100\n Now, all of a sudden you kind of had this body of data\n\n23:17.100 --> 23:19.620\n that you could run analysis on.\n\n23:19.620 --> 23:22.180\n And so that's when people started to see, you know,\n\n23:22.180 --> 23:24.260\n these mathematical solutions.\n\n23:26.780 --> 23:31.780\n And so what that meant is the role of intuition\n\n23:32.500 --> 23:33.940\n essentially became smaller.\n\n23:35.540 --> 23:38.660\n And it went more into, as we talked before about,\n\n23:38.660 --> 23:40.620\n you know, this game theory optimal style.\n\n23:40.620 --> 23:43.340\n But also, as I said, like game theory optimal\n\n23:43.340 --> 23:47.740\n is about loss minimization and being unexploitable.\n\n23:47.740 --> 23:49.620\n But if you're playing against people who aren't,\n\n23:49.620 --> 23:51.620\n because no person, no human being can play perfectly\n\n23:51.620 --> 23:54.020\n game theory optimal in poker, not even the best AIs.\n\n23:54.020 --> 23:55.460\n They're still like, you know,\n\n23:55.460 --> 23:57.540\n they're 99.99% of the way there or whatever,\n\n23:57.540 --> 23:59.260\n but it's kind of like the speed of light.\n\n23:59.260 --> 24:01.060\n You can't reach it perfectly.\n\n24:01.060 --> 24:03.780\n So there's still a role for intuition?\n\n24:03.780 --> 24:05.780\n Yes, so when, yeah,\n\n24:05.780 --> 24:08.460\n when you're playing this unexploitable style,\n\n24:08.460 --> 24:11.420\n but when your opponents start doing something,\n\n24:11.420 --> 24:14.140\n you know, suboptimal that you want to exploit,\n\n24:14.140 --> 24:17.340\n well, now that's where not only your like logical brain\n\n24:17.340 --> 24:18.700\n will need to be thinking, well, okay,\n\n24:18.700 --> 24:21.300\n I know I have this, I'm in the sort of top end\n\n24:21.300 --> 24:23.940\n of my range here with this hand.\n\n24:23.940 --> 24:26.820\n So that means I need to be calling X percent of the time\n\n24:27.780 --> 24:30.460\n and I put them on this range, et cetera.\n\n24:30.460 --> 24:34.020\n But then sometimes you'll have this gut feeling\n\n24:34.020 --> 24:37.300\n that will tell you, you know what, this time,\n\n24:37.300 --> 24:40.060\n I know mathematically I'm meant to call now.\n\n24:40.060 --> 24:42.740\n You know, I'm in the sort of top end of my range\n\n24:42.740 --> 24:45.140\n and this is the odds I'm getting.\n\n24:45.140 --> 24:46.300\n So the math says I should call,\n\n24:46.300 --> 24:48.340\n but there's something in your gut saying,\n\n24:48.340 --> 24:49.940\n they've got it this time, they've got it.\n\n24:49.940 --> 24:54.940\n Like they're beating you, your hand is worse.\n\n24:55.180 --> 24:56.940\n So then the real art,\n\n24:56.940 --> 24:59.620\n this is where the last remaining art in poker,\n\n24:59.620 --> 25:03.660\n the fuzziness is like, do you listen to your gut?\n\n25:03.660 --> 25:06.100\n How do you quantify the strength of it?\n\n25:06.100 --> 25:08.340\n Or can you even quantify the strength of it?\n\n25:08.340 --> 25:13.100\n And I think that's what Daniel has.\n\n25:13.100 --> 25:15.340\n I mean, I can't speak for how much he's studying\n\n25:15.340 --> 25:17.740\n with the simulators and that kind of thing.\n\n25:17.740 --> 25:22.260\n I think he has, like he must be to still be keeping up.\n\n25:22.260 --> 25:26.340\n But he has an incredible intuition for just,\n\n25:26.340 --> 25:29.180\n he's seen so many hands of poker in the flesh.\n\n25:29.180 --> 25:31.860\n He's seen so many people, the way they behave\n\n25:31.860 --> 25:33.740\n when the chips are, you know, when the money's on the line\n\n25:33.740 --> 25:36.100\n and he've got him staring you down in the eye.\n\n25:36.100 --> 25:37.460\n You know, he's intimidating.\n\n25:37.460 --> 25:39.620\n He's got this like kind of X factor vibe\n\n25:39.620 --> 25:42.180\n that he, you know, gives out.\n\n25:42.180 --> 25:45.020\n And he talks a lot, which is an interactive element,\n\n25:45.020 --> 25:47.180\n which is he's getting stuff from other people.\n\n25:47.180 --> 25:48.020\n Yes, yeah.\n\n25:48.020 --> 25:49.340\n And just like the subtlety.\n\n25:49.340 --> 25:51.460\n So he's like, he's probing constantly.\n\n25:51.460 --> 25:53.900\n Yeah, he's probing and he's getting this extra layer\n\n25:53.900 --> 25:55.940\n of information that others can't.\n\n25:55.940 --> 25:57.900\n Now that said though, he's good online as well.\n\n25:57.900 --> 25:59.660\n You know, I don't know how, again,\n\n25:59.660 --> 26:02.660\n would he be beating the top cash game players online?\n\n26:02.660 --> 26:03.900\n Probably not, no.\n\n26:03.900 --> 26:07.260\n But when he's in person and he's got that additional\n\n26:07.260 --> 26:09.700\n layer of information, he can not only extract it,\n\n26:09.700 --> 26:13.140\n but he knows what to do with it still so well.\n\n26:13.140 --> 26:15.140\n There's one player who I would say is the exception\n\n26:15.140 --> 26:15.980\n to all of this.\n\n26:16.980 --> 26:18.940\n And he's one of my favorite people to talk about\n\n26:18.940 --> 26:23.460\n in terms of, I think he might have cracked the simulation.\n\n26:23.460 --> 26:24.540\n It's Phil Helmuth.\n\n26:25.540 --> 26:27.060\n He...\n\n26:27.060 --> 26:29.140\n In more ways than one, he's cracked the simulation,\n\n26:29.140 --> 26:29.980\n I think.\n\n26:29.980 --> 26:33.700\n Yeah, he somehow to this day is still\n\n26:33.700 --> 26:36.540\n and I love you Phil, I'm not in any way knocking you.\n\n26:37.500 --> 26:41.220\n He is still winning so much at the World Series\n\n26:41.220 --> 26:43.100\n of Poker specifically.\n\n26:43.100 --> 26:44.780\n He's now won 16 bracelets.\n\n26:44.780 --> 26:46.780\n The next nearest person I think has won 10.\n\n26:47.660 --> 26:50.100\n And he is consistently year in, year out going deep\n\n26:50.100 --> 26:52.420\n or winning these huge field tournaments,\n\n26:52.420 --> 26:54.580\n you know, with like 2000 people,\n\n26:54.580 --> 26:57.060\n which statistically he should not be doing.\n\n26:57.060 --> 27:02.060\n And yet you watch some of the plays he makes\n\n27:02.060 --> 27:04.260\n and they make no sense, like mathematically,\n\n27:04.260 --> 27:07.020\n they are so far from game theory optimal.\n\n27:07.020 --> 27:08.540\n And the thing is, if you went and stuck him\n\n27:08.540 --> 27:10.860\n in one of these high stakes cash games\n\n27:10.860 --> 27:12.740\n with a bunch of like GTO people,\n\n27:12.740 --> 27:14.540\n he's gonna get ripped apart.\n\n27:14.540 --> 27:16.500\n But there's something that he has that when he's\n\n27:16.500 --> 27:19.100\n in the halls of the World Series of Poker specifically,\n\n27:20.420 --> 27:23.340\n amongst sort of amateurish players,\n\n27:23.340 --> 27:26.340\n he gets them to do crazy shit like that.\n\n27:26.340 --> 27:30.540\n And, but my little pet theory is that also,\n\n27:30.540 --> 27:35.100\n he just, the card, he's like a wizard\n\n27:35.100 --> 27:37.460\n and he gets the cards to do what he needs them to.\n\n27:38.980 --> 27:43.980\n Because he just expects to win and he expects to receive,\n\n27:43.980 --> 27:47.300\n you know, to get flopper set with a frequency far beyond\n\n27:47.300 --> 27:50.780\n what the real percentages are.\n\n27:50.780 --> 27:52.500\n And I don't even know if he knows what the real percentages\n\n27:52.500 --> 27:54.700\n are, he doesn't need to, because he gets there.\n\n27:54.700 --> 27:55.980\n I think he has found the Chico,\n\n27:55.980 --> 27:57.380\n because when I've seen him play,\n\n27:57.380 --> 28:01.300\n he seems to be like annoyed that the long shot thing\n\n28:01.300 --> 28:02.140\n didn't happen.\n\n28:02.140 --> 28:05.820\n He's like annoyed and it's almost like everybody else\n\n28:05.820 --> 28:08.020\n is stupid because he was obviously going to win\n\n28:08.020 --> 28:08.860\n with the spare.\n\n28:08.860 --> 28:10.540\n If that silly thing hadn't happened.\n\n28:10.540 --> 28:11.460\n And it's like, you don't understand,\n\n28:11.460 --> 28:13.940\n the silly thing happens 99% of the time.\n\n28:13.940 --> 28:15.700\n And it's a 1%, not the other way around,\n\n28:15.700 --> 28:18.580\n but genuinely for his lived experience at the World Series,\n\n28:18.580 --> 28:21.540\n only at the World Series of Poker, it is like that.\n\n28:21.540 --> 28:24.020\n So I don't blame him for feeling that way.\n\n28:24.020 --> 28:26.460\n But he does, he has this X factor\n\n28:26.460 --> 28:29.940\n and the poker community has tried for years\n\n28:29.940 --> 28:32.740\n to rip him down saying like, he's no good,\n\n28:32.740 --> 28:34.540\n but he's clearly good because he's still winning\n\n28:34.540 --> 28:36.220\n or there's something going on.\n\n28:36.220 --> 28:39.140\n Whether that's he's figured out how to mess\n\n28:39.140 --> 28:42.580\n with the fabric of reality and how cards,\n\n28:42.580 --> 28:44.300\n a randomly shuffled deck of cards come out.\n\n28:44.300 --> 28:46.660\n I don't know what it is, but he's doing it right still.\n\n28:46.660 --> 28:48.700\n Who do you think is the greatest of all time?\n\n28:48.700 --> 28:49.860\n Would you put Hellmuth?\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:54.660\n Not Hellmuth definitely, he seems like the kind of person\n\n28:54.660 --> 28:56.460\n when mentioned he would actually watch this.\n\n28:56.460 --> 28:58.380\n So you might wanna be careful.\n\n28:58.380 --> 29:02.420\n Well, as I said, I love Phil and I have,\n\n29:02.420 --> 29:04.180\n I would say this to his face, I'm not saying anything.\n\n29:04.180 --> 29:06.980\n I don't, he's got, he truly, I mean,\n\n29:06.980 --> 29:09.540\n he is one of the greatest.\n\n29:09.540 --> 29:10.980\n I don't know if he's the greatest,\n\n29:10.980 --> 29:14.300\n he's certainly the greatest at the World Series of Poker.\n\n29:14.300 --> 29:17.980\n And he is the greatest at, despite the game switching\n\n29:17.980 --> 29:20.900\n into a pure game, almost an entire game of math,\n\n29:20.900 --> 29:22.860\n he has managed to keep the magic alive.\n\n29:22.860 --> 29:26.020\n And this like, just through sheer force of will,\n\n29:26.020 --> 29:27.620\n making the game work for him.\n\n29:27.620 --> 29:28.660\n And that is incredible.\n\n29:28.660 --> 29:30.460\n And I think it's something that should be studied\n\n29:30.460 --> 29:32.020\n because it's an example.\n\n29:32.020 --> 29:35.260\n Yeah, there might be some actual game theoretic wisdom.\n\n29:35.260 --> 29:37.420\n There might be something to be said about optimality\n\n29:37.420 --> 29:39.220\n from studying him.\n\n29:39.220 --> 29:40.940\n What do you mean by optimality?\n\n29:40.940 --> 29:45.540\n Meaning, or rather game design, perhaps.\n\n29:45.540 --> 29:48.460\n Meaning if what he's doing is working,\n\n29:48.460 --> 29:51.620\n maybe poker is more complicated\n\n29:51.620 --> 29:54.220\n than the one we're currently modeling it as.\n\n29:54.220 --> 29:55.060\n So like his, yeah.\n\n29:55.060 --> 29:56.660\n Or there's an extra layer,\n\n29:56.660 --> 29:59.500\n and I don't mean to get too weird and wooey,\n\n29:59.500 --> 30:04.700\n but, or there's an extra layer of ability\n\n30:04.700 --> 30:07.580\n to manipulate the things the way you want them to go\n\n30:07.580 --> 30:09.780\n that we don't understand yet.\n\n30:09.780 --> 30:12.020\n Do you think Phil Hellmuth understands them?\n\n30:12.020 --> 30:13.660\n Is he just generally?\n\n30:13.660 --> 30:14.780\n Hashtag positivity.\n\n30:14.780 --> 30:17.220\n Well, he wrote a book on positivity and he's.\n\n30:17.220 --> 30:20.460\n He has, he did, not like a trolling book.\n\n30:20.460 --> 30:21.300\n No.\n\n30:21.300 --> 30:22.900\n He's just straight up, yeah.\n\n30:23.980 --> 30:26.020\n Phil Hellmuth wrote a book about positivity.\n\n30:26.020 --> 30:27.220\n Yes.\n\n30:27.220 --> 30:28.620\n Okay, not ironic.\n\n30:28.620 --> 30:31.820\n And I think it's about sort of manifesting what you want\n\n30:32.700 --> 30:34.100\n and getting the outcomes that you want\n\n30:34.100 --> 30:36.460\n by believing so much in yourself\n\n30:36.460 --> 30:37.620\n and in your ability to win,\n\n30:37.620 --> 30:38.980\n like eyes on the prize.\n\n30:40.540 --> 30:42.140\n And I mean, it's working.\n\n30:42.140 --> 30:43.180\n The man's delivered.\n\n30:43.180 --> 30:45.340\n But where do you put like Phil Ivey\n\n30:45.340 --> 30:47.300\n and all those kinds of people?\n\n30:47.300 --> 30:49.700\n I mean, I'm too, I've been,\n\n30:49.700 --> 30:50.900\n to be honest too much out of the scene\n\n30:50.900 --> 30:52.620\n for the last few years to really,\n\n30:53.740 --> 30:54.940\n I mean, Phil Ivey's clearly got,\n\n30:54.940 --> 30:56.500\n again, he's got that X factor.\n\n30:57.900 --> 31:00.340\n He's so incredibly intimidating to play against.\n\n31:00.340 --> 31:01.700\n I've only played against him a couple of times,\n\n31:01.700 --> 31:03.660\n but when he like looks you in the eye\n\n31:03.660 --> 31:04.980\n and you're trying to run a bluff on him,\n\n31:04.980 --> 31:07.100\n oof, no one's made me sweat harder than Phil Ivey,\n\n31:07.100 --> 31:10.340\n just my bluff got through actually.\n\n31:10.340 --> 31:11.780\n That was actually one of the most thrilling moments\n\n31:11.780 --> 31:12.940\n I've ever had in poker was,\n\n31:12.940 --> 31:15.460\n it was in a Monte Carlo in a high roller.\n\n31:15.460 --> 31:16.700\n I can't remember exactly what the hand was,\n\n31:16.700 --> 31:19.500\n but I, you know, a three bit\n\n31:19.500 --> 31:22.100\n and then like just barreled all the way through.\n\n31:22.100 --> 31:24.380\n And he just like put his laser eyes into me.\n\n31:24.380 --> 31:28.180\n And I felt like he was just scouring my soul.\n\n31:28.180 --> 31:29.780\n And I was just like, hold it together, Liv,\n\n31:29.780 --> 31:30.620\n hold it together.\n\n31:30.620 --> 31:31.460\n And he was like, folded.\n\n31:31.460 --> 31:33.060\n And you knew your hand was weaker.\n\n31:33.060 --> 31:34.420\n Yeah, I mean, I was bluffing.\n\n31:34.420 --> 31:36.420\n I presume, which, you know,\n\n31:36.420 --> 31:37.780\n there's a chance I was bluffing with the best hand,\n\n31:37.780 --> 31:39.780\n but I'm pretty sure my hand was worse.\n\n31:40.700 --> 31:43.300\n And he folded.\n\n31:44.620 --> 31:47.500\n I was truly one of the deep highlights of my career.\n\n31:47.500 --> 31:50.020\n Did you show the cards or did you fold?\n\n31:50.020 --> 31:51.980\n You should never show in game.\n\n31:51.980 --> 31:53.660\n Like, because especially as I felt like\n\n31:53.660 --> 31:54.900\n I was one of the worst players at the table\n\n31:54.900 --> 31:55.740\n in that tournament.\n\n31:55.740 --> 31:57.900\n So giving that information,\n\n31:57.900 --> 31:59.900\n unless I had a really solid plan\n\n31:59.900 --> 32:01.980\n that I was now like advertising,\n\n32:01.980 --> 32:03.580\n oh, look, I'm capable of bluffing Phil Ivey.\n\n32:03.580 --> 32:05.140\n But like, why?\n\n32:05.140 --> 32:07.620\n It's much more valuable to take advantage\n\n32:07.620 --> 32:09.020\n of the impression that they have of me,\n\n32:09.020 --> 32:10.220\n which is like, I'm a scared girl\n\n32:10.220 --> 32:12.060\n playing a high roller for the first time.\n\n32:12.060 --> 32:13.380\n Keep that going, you know.\n\n32:14.740 --> 32:15.580\n Interesting.\n\n32:15.580 --> 32:17.100\n But isn't there layers to this?\n\n32:17.100 --> 32:18.780\n Like psychological warfare\n\n32:18.780 --> 32:22.420\n that the scared girl might be way smart\n\n32:22.420 --> 32:24.700\n and then like just to flip the tables?\n\n32:24.700 --> 32:25.540\n Do you think about that kind of stuff?\n\n32:25.540 --> 32:28.500\n Or is it better not to reveal information?\n\n32:28.500 --> 32:29.500\n I mean, generally speaking,\n\n32:29.500 --> 32:31.060\n you want to not reveal information.\n\n32:31.060 --> 32:32.700\n You know, the goal of poker is to be\n\n32:32.700 --> 32:36.020\n as deceptive as possible about your own strategies\n\n32:36.020 --> 32:38.700\n while elucidating as much out of your opponent\n\n32:38.700 --> 32:39.740\n about their own.\n\n32:39.740 --> 32:42.100\n So giving them free information,\n\n32:42.100 --> 32:42.940\n particularly if they're people\n\n32:42.940 --> 32:44.820\n who you consider very good players,\n\n32:44.820 --> 32:47.100\n any information I give them is going into\n\n32:47.100 --> 32:49.220\n their little database and being,\n\n32:49.220 --> 32:51.780\n I assume it's going to be calculated and used well.\n\n32:51.780 --> 32:53.500\n So I have to be really confident\n\n32:53.500 --> 32:56.700\n that my like meta gaming that I'm going to then do,\n\n32:56.700 --> 32:58.340\n oh, they've seen this, so therefore that.\n\n32:58.340 --> 33:00.660\n I'm going to be on the right level.\n\n33:00.660 --> 33:03.380\n So it's better just to keep that little secret\n\n33:03.380 --> 33:04.340\n to myself in the moment.\n\n33:04.340 --> 33:06.700\n So how much is bluffing part of the game?\n\n33:06.700 --> 33:08.340\n Huge amount.\n\n33:08.340 --> 33:10.420\n So yeah, I mean, maybe actually let me ask,\n\n33:10.420 --> 33:12.980\n like, what did it feel like with Phil Ivey\n\n33:12.980 --> 33:15.020\n or anyone else when it's a high stake,\n\n33:15.020 --> 33:18.860\n when it's a big, it's a big bluff?\n\n33:18.860 --> 33:23.060\n So a lot of money on the table and maybe,\n\n33:23.060 --> 33:24.660\n I mean, what defines a big bluff?\n\n33:24.660 --> 33:25.980\n Maybe a lot of money on the table,\n\n33:25.980 --> 33:29.180\n but also some uncertainty in your mind and heart\n\n33:29.180 --> 33:31.940\n about like self doubt.\n\n33:31.940 --> 33:34.540\n Well, maybe I miscalculated what's going on here,\n\n33:34.540 --> 33:36.740\n what the bet said, all that kind of stuff.\n\n33:36.740 --> 33:38.820\n Like, what does that feel like?\n\n33:38.820 --> 33:43.820\n I mean, it's, I imagine comparable to,\n\n33:45.980 --> 33:49.020\n you know, running a, I mean, any kind of big bluff\n\n33:49.020 --> 33:52.380\n where you have a lot of something\n\n33:52.380 --> 33:54.260\n that you care about on the line.\n\n33:54.260 --> 33:57.220\n You know, so if you're bluffing in a courtroom,\n\n33:57.220 --> 33:58.180\n not that anyone should ever do that,\n\n33:58.180 --> 34:00.340\n or, you know, something equatable to that.\n\n34:00.340 --> 34:04.100\n It's, you know, in that scenario, you know,\n\n34:04.100 --> 34:05.700\n I think it was the first time I'd ever played a 20,\n\n34:05.700 --> 34:09.180\n I'd won my way into this 25K tournament.\n\n34:09.180 --> 34:11.180\n So that was the buy in 25,000 euros.\n\n34:11.180 --> 34:13.020\n And I had satelliteed my way in\n\n34:13.020 --> 34:14.020\n because it was much bigger\n\n34:14.020 --> 34:16.060\n than I would ever normally play.\n\n34:16.060 --> 34:18.260\n And, you know, I hadn't, I wasn't that experienced\n\n34:18.260 --> 34:20.140\n at the time, and now I was sitting there\n\n34:20.140 --> 34:21.620\n against all the big boys, you know,\n\n34:21.620 --> 34:23.580\n the Negronus, the Phil Ivey's and so on.\n\n34:24.740 --> 34:28.780\n And then to like, you know,\n\n34:28.780 --> 34:30.580\n each time you put the bets out, you know,\n\n34:30.580 --> 34:33.020\n you put another bet out, your card.\n\n34:33.020 --> 34:34.860\n Yeah, I was on what's called a semi bluff.\n\n34:34.860 --> 34:36.300\n So there were some cards that could come\n\n34:36.300 --> 34:38.100\n that would make my hand very, very strong\n\n34:38.100 --> 34:39.180\n and therefore win.\n\n34:39.180 --> 34:40.940\n But most of the time, those cards don't come.\n\n34:40.940 --> 34:43.860\n So that is a semi bluff because you're representing,\n\n34:43.860 --> 34:46.980\n are you representing that you already have something?\n\n34:47.860 --> 34:51.340\n So I think in this scenario, I had a flush draw.\n\n34:51.340 --> 34:55.940\n So I had two clubs, two clubs came out on the flop.\n\n34:55.940 --> 34:57.260\n And then I'm hoping that on the turn\n\n34:57.260 --> 34:59.140\n and the river, one will come.\n\n34:59.140 --> 35:00.980\n So I have some future equity.\n\n35:00.980 --> 35:02.780\n I could hit a club and then I'll have the best hand\n\n35:02.780 --> 35:04.620\n in which case, great.\n\n35:04.620 --> 35:07.460\n And so I can keep betting and I'll want them to call,\n\n35:07.460 --> 35:09.660\n but I'm also got the other way of winning the hand\n\n35:09.660 --> 35:11.940\n where if my card doesn't come,\n\n35:11.940 --> 35:14.740\n I can keep betting and get them to fold their hand.\n\n35:14.740 --> 35:18.020\n And I'm pretty sure that's what the scenario was.\n\n35:18.020 --> 35:21.020\n So I had some future equity, but it's still, you know,\n\n35:21.020 --> 35:23.300\n most of the time I don't hit that club.\n\n35:23.300 --> 35:25.940\n And so I would rather him just fold because I'm, you know,\n\n35:25.940 --> 35:27.820\n the pot is now getting bigger and bigger.\n\n35:27.820 --> 35:30.980\n And in the end, like I've jam all in on the river.\n\n35:30.980 --> 35:33.420\n That's my entire tournament on the line.\n\n35:33.420 --> 35:35.180\n As far as I'm aware, this might be the one time\n\n35:35.180 --> 35:37.220\n I ever get to play a big 25K.\n\n35:37.220 --> 35:38.700\n You know, this was the first time I played one.\n\n35:38.700 --> 35:42.020\n So it was, it felt like the most momentous thing.\n\n35:42.020 --> 35:43.900\n And this was also when I was trying to build myself up at,\n\n35:43.900 --> 35:46.700\n you know, build my name, a name for myself in poker.\n\n35:46.700 --> 35:47.740\n I wanted to get respect.\n\n35:47.740 --> 35:49.260\n Destroy everything for you.\n\n35:49.260 --> 35:50.540\n It felt like it in the moment.\n\n35:50.540 --> 35:51.780\n Like, I mean, it literally does feel\n\n35:51.780 --> 35:52.820\n like a form of life and death.\n\n35:52.820 --> 35:54.340\n Like your body physiologically\n\n35:54.340 --> 35:56.140\n is having that flight or fight response.\n\n35:56.140 --> 35:57.140\n What are you doing with your body?\n\n35:57.140 --> 35:58.340\n What are you doing with your face?\n\n35:58.340 --> 36:01.340\n Are you just like, what are you thinking about?\n\n36:01.340 --> 36:04.700\n More of a mixture of like, okay, what are the cards?\n\n36:04.700 --> 36:07.020\n So in theory, I'm thinking about like, okay,\n\n36:07.020 --> 36:09.980\n what are cards that make my hand look stronger?\n\n36:09.980 --> 36:13.860\n Which cards hit my perceived range from his perspective?\n\n36:13.860 --> 36:15.620\n Which cards don't?\n\n36:15.620 --> 36:17.340\n What's the right amount of bet size\n\n36:17.340 --> 36:20.820\n to maximize my fold equity in this situation?\n\n36:20.820 --> 36:22.100\n You know, that's the logical stuff\n\n36:22.100 --> 36:23.180\n that I should be thinking about.\n\n36:23.180 --> 36:25.380\n But I think in reality, because I was so scared,\n\n36:25.380 --> 36:26.860\n because there's this, at least for me,\n\n36:26.860 --> 36:30.420\n there's a certain threshold of like nervousness or stress\n\n36:30.420 --> 36:33.420\n beyond which the logical brain shuts off.\n\n36:33.420 --> 36:35.220\n And now it just gets into this like,\n\n36:36.900 --> 36:38.740\n just like, it feels like a game of wits, basically.\n\n36:38.740 --> 36:39.780\n It's like of nerve.\n\n36:39.780 --> 36:41.780\n Can you hold your resolve?\n\n36:41.780 --> 36:44.300\n And it certainly got by that, like by the river.\n\n36:44.300 --> 36:45.780\n I think by that point, I was like,\n\n36:45.780 --> 36:47.660\n I don't even know if this is a good bluff anymore,\n\n36:47.660 --> 36:50.060\n but fuck it, let's do it.\n\n36:50.060 --> 36:53.100\n Your mind is almost numb from the intensity of that feeling.\n\n36:53.100 --> 36:55.100\n I call it the white noise.\n\n36:55.100 --> 36:58.860\n And it happens in all kinds of decision making.\n\n36:58.860 --> 37:00.740\n I think anything that's really, really stressful.\n\n37:00.740 --> 37:02.940\n I can imagine someone in like an important job interview,\n\n37:02.940 --> 37:04.780\n if it's like a job they've always wanted,\n\n37:04.780 --> 37:06.540\n and they're getting grilled, you know,\n\n37:06.540 --> 37:09.180\n like Bridgewater style, where they ask these really hard,\n\n37:09.180 --> 37:11.140\n like mathematical questions.\n\n37:11.140 --> 37:13.420\n You know, it's a really learned skill\n\n37:13.420 --> 37:17.780\n to be able to like subdue your flight or fight response.\n\n37:17.780 --> 37:19.380\n You know, I think get from the sympathetic\n\n37:19.380 --> 37:20.340\n into the parasympathetic.\n\n37:20.340 --> 37:23.820\n So you can actually, you know, engage that voice\n\n37:23.820 --> 37:26.020\n in your head and do those slow logical calculations.\n\n37:26.020 --> 37:29.020\n Because evolutionarily, you know, if we see a lion\n\n37:29.020 --> 37:31.660\n running at us, we didn't have time to sort of calculate\n\n37:31.660 --> 37:33.980\n the lion's kinetic energy and, you know,\n\n37:33.980 --> 37:35.420\n is it optimal to go this way or that way?\n\n37:35.420 --> 37:37.060\n You just react it.\n\n37:37.060 --> 37:39.860\n And physically, our bodies are well attuned\n\n37:39.860 --> 37:41.140\n to actually make right decisions.\n\n37:41.140 --> 37:43.220\n But when you're playing a game like poker,\n\n37:43.220 --> 37:44.780\n this is not something that you ever, you know,\n\n37:44.780 --> 37:45.940\n evolved to do.\n\n37:45.940 --> 37:48.980\n And yet you're in that same flight or fight response.\n\n37:48.980 --> 37:51.740\n And so that's a really important skill to be able to develop\n\n37:51.740 --> 37:54.900\n to basically learn how to like meditate in the moment\n\n37:54.900 --> 37:57.420\n and calm yourself so that you can think clearly.\n\n37:57.420 --> 38:00.780\n But as you were searching for a comparable thing,\n\n38:00.780 --> 38:03.300\n it's interesting because you just made me realize\n\n38:03.300 --> 38:06.580\n that bluffing is like an incredibly high stakes\n\n38:06.580 --> 38:08.180\n form of lying.\n\n38:08.180 --> 38:09.660\n You're lying.\n\n38:10.780 --> 38:11.620\n And I don't think you can.\n\n38:11.620 --> 38:12.460\n Telling a story.\n\n38:12.460 --> 38:15.180\n No, no, it's straight up lying.\n\n38:15.180 --> 38:19.060\n In the context of game, it's not a negative kind of lying.\n\n38:19.060 --> 38:19.900\n But it is, yeah, exactly.\n\n38:19.900 --> 38:23.340\n You're representing something that you don't have.\n\n38:23.340 --> 38:26.740\n And I was thinking like how often in life\n\n38:26.740 --> 38:30.300\n do we have such high stakes of lying?\n\n38:30.300 --> 38:33.420\n Because I was thinking certainly\n\n38:33.420 --> 38:36.060\n in high level military strategy,\n\n38:36.060 --> 38:40.220\n I was thinking when Hitler was lying to Stalin\n\n38:40.220 --> 38:44.540\n about his plans to invade the Soviet Union.\n\n38:44.540 --> 38:48.300\n And so you're talking to a person like your friends\n\n38:48.300 --> 38:50.700\n and you're fighting against the enemy,\n\n38:50.700 --> 38:53.900\n whatever the formulation of the enemy is.\n\n38:53.900 --> 38:56.780\n But meanwhile, whole time you're building up troops\n\n38:56.780 --> 38:57.620\n on the border.\n\n38:58.900 --> 38:59.740\n That's extremely.\n\n38:59.740 --> 39:01.420\n Wait, wait, so Hitler and Stalin were like\n\n39:01.420 --> 39:02.460\n pretending to be friends?\n\n39:02.460 --> 39:03.300\n Yeah.\n\n39:03.300 --> 39:04.140\n Well, my history knowledge is terrible.\n\n39:04.140 --> 39:04.980\n Oh yeah.\n\n39:04.980 --> 39:05.820\n That's crazy.\n\n39:05.820 --> 39:09.500\n Yeah, that they were, oh man.\n\n39:09.500 --> 39:11.460\n And it worked because Stalin,\n\n39:11.460 --> 39:14.260\n until the troops crossed the border\n\n39:14.260 --> 39:17.500\n and invaded in Operation Barbarossa\n\n39:17.500 --> 39:22.500\n where this storm of Nazi troops\n\n39:22.780 --> 39:25.100\n invaded large parts of the Soviet Union.\n\n39:25.100 --> 39:30.100\n And hence, one of the biggest wars in human history began.\n\n39:30.380 --> 39:34.900\n Stalin for sure thought that this was never going to be,\n\n39:34.900 --> 39:38.660\n that Hitler is not crazy enough to invade the Soviet Union.\n\n39:38.660 --> 39:41.780\n And it makes, geopolitically makes total sense\n\n39:41.780 --> 39:43.020\n to be collaborators.\n\n39:43.020 --> 39:46.260\n And ideologically, even though there's a tension\n\n39:46.260 --> 39:50.300\n between communism and fascism or national socialism,\n\n39:50.300 --> 39:51.500\n however you formulate it,\n\n39:51.500 --> 39:54.340\n it still feels like this is the right way\n\n39:54.340 --> 39:55.780\n to battle the West.\n\n39:55.780 --> 39:56.620\n Right.\n\n39:56.620 --> 39:58.660\n They were more ideologically aligned.\n\n39:58.660 --> 40:01.380\n They in theory had a common enemy, which is the West.\n\n40:01.380 --> 40:03.460\n So it made total sense.\n\n40:03.460 --> 40:05.420\n And in terms of negotiations\n\n40:05.420 --> 40:07.300\n and the way things were communicated,\n\n40:07.300 --> 40:11.540\n it seemed to Stalin that for sure,\n\n40:11.540 --> 40:16.100\n that they would remain, at least for a while,\n\n40:16.100 --> 40:17.620\n peaceful collaborators.\n\n40:17.620 --> 40:21.380\n And that, and everybody, because of that,\n\n40:21.380 --> 40:24.140\n in the Soviet Union believed that it was a huge shock\n\n40:24.140 --> 40:25.820\n when Kiev was invaded.\n\n40:25.820 --> 40:28.220\n And you hear echoes of that when I travel to Ukraine,\n\n40:28.220 --> 40:32.180\n sort of the shock of the invasion.\n\n40:32.180 --> 40:34.500\n It's not just the invasion on one particular border,\n\n40:34.500 --> 40:36.700\n but the invasion of the capital city.\n\n40:36.700 --> 40:41.380\n And just like, holy shit, especially at that time,\n\n40:41.380 --> 40:44.220\n when you thought World War I,\n\n40:44.220 --> 40:46.900\n you realized that that was the war to end all wars.\n\n40:46.900 --> 40:48.980\n You would never have this kind of war.\n\n40:48.980 --> 40:52.380\n And holy shit, this person is mad enough\n\n40:52.380 --> 40:56.300\n to try to take on this monster in the Soviet Union.\n\n40:56.300 --> 40:58.300\n So it's no longer going to be a war\n\n40:58.300 --> 40:59.820\n of hundreds of thousands dead.\n\n40:59.820 --> 41:02.260\n It'll be a war of tens of millions dead.\n\n41:02.260 --> 41:07.260\n And yeah, but that, that's a very large scale kind of lie,\n\n41:08.260 --> 41:11.460\n but I'm sure there's in politics and geopolitics,\n\n41:11.460 --> 41:14.620\n that kind of lying happening all the time.\n\n41:14.620 --> 41:17.260\n And a lot of people pay financially\n\n41:17.260 --> 41:19.060\n and with their lives for that kind of lying.\n\n41:19.060 --> 41:22.260\n But in our personal lives, I don't know how often we,\n\n41:22.260 --> 41:23.100\n maybe we.\n\n41:23.100 --> 41:23.940\n I think people do.\n\n41:23.940 --> 41:25.900\n I mean, like think of spouses\n\n41:25.900 --> 41:27.340\n cheating on their partners, right?\n\n41:27.340 --> 41:28.340\n And then like having to lie,\n\n41:28.340 --> 41:29.540\n like where were you last night?\n\n41:29.540 --> 41:30.580\n Stuff like that. Oh shit, that's tough.\n\n41:30.580 --> 41:31.420\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n41:31.420 --> 41:34.220\n Like that's, I think, you know, I mean,\n\n41:34.220 --> 41:36.180\n unfortunately that stuff happens all the time, right?\n\n41:36.180 --> 41:38.740\n Or having like multiple families, that one is great.\n\n41:38.740 --> 41:42.220\n When each family doesn't know about the other one\n\n41:42.220 --> 41:44.620\n and like maintaining that life.\n\n41:44.620 --> 41:47.260\n There's probably a sense of excitement about that too.\n\n41:48.580 --> 41:50.700\n Or. It seems unnecessary, yeah.\n\n41:50.700 --> 41:51.740\n But. Why?\n\n41:51.740 --> 41:52.580\n Well, just lying.\n\n41:52.580 --> 41:56.300\n Like, you know, the truth finds a way of coming out.\n\n41:56.300 --> 41:57.140\n You know? Yes.\n\n41:57.140 --> 41:59.220\n But hence that's the thrill.\n\n41:59.220 --> 42:00.220\n Yeah, perhaps.\n\n42:00.220 --> 42:01.060\n Yeah, people.\n\n42:01.060 --> 42:04.220\n I mean, you know, that's why I think actually like poker.\n\n42:04.220 --> 42:05.940\n What's so interesting about poker\n\n42:05.940 --> 42:09.860\n is most of the best players I know,\n\n42:09.860 --> 42:10.900\n they're always exceptions, you know?\n\n42:10.900 --> 42:12.460\n They're always bad eggs.\n\n42:12.460 --> 42:15.140\n But actually poker players are very honest people.\n\n42:15.140 --> 42:17.540\n I would say they are more honest than the average,\n\n42:17.540 --> 42:22.380\n you know, if you just took random population sample.\n\n42:22.380 --> 42:26.100\n Because A, you know, I think, you know,\n\n42:26.100 --> 42:27.580\n humans like to have that.\n\n42:28.500 --> 42:30.580\n Most people like to have some kind of, you know,\n\n42:30.580 --> 42:32.740\n mysterious, you know, an opportunity to do something\n\n42:32.740 --> 42:34.900\n like a little edgy.\n\n42:34.900 --> 42:36.860\n So we get to sort of scratch that itch\n\n42:36.860 --> 42:38.340\n of being edgy at the poker table,\n\n42:38.340 --> 42:40.420\n where it's like, it's part of the game.\n\n42:40.420 --> 42:43.420\n Everyone knows what they're in for, and that's allowed.\n\n42:43.420 --> 42:46.260\n And you get to like really get that out of your system.\n\n42:47.740 --> 42:51.220\n And then also like poker players learned that, you know,\n\n42:51.220 --> 42:55.380\n I would play in a huge game against some of my friends,\n\n42:55.380 --> 42:57.740\n even my partner, Igor, where we will be, you know,\n\n42:57.740 --> 42:59.660\n absolutely going at each other's throats,\n\n42:59.660 --> 43:02.060\n trying to draw blood in terms of winning each money\n\n43:02.060 --> 43:04.020\n off each other and like getting under each other's skin,\n\n43:04.020 --> 43:08.340\n winding each other up, doing the craftiest moves we can.\n\n43:08.340 --> 43:11.100\n But then once the game's done, you know,\n\n43:11.100 --> 43:12.260\n the winners and the losers will go off\n\n43:12.260 --> 43:13.860\n and get a drink together and have a fun time\n\n43:13.860 --> 43:16.660\n and like talk about it in this like weird academic way\n\n43:16.660 --> 43:19.500\n afterwards, because, and that's why games are so great.\n\n43:19.500 --> 43:23.980\n Cause you get to like live out like this competitive urge\n\n43:23.980 --> 43:26.420\n that, you know, most people have.\n\n43:26.420 --> 43:28.660\n What's it feel like to lose?\n\n43:28.660 --> 43:31.380\n Like we talked about bluffing when it worked out.\n\n43:31.380 --> 43:34.540\n What about when you, when you go broke?\n\n43:35.380 --> 43:39.140\n So like in a game, I'm, fortunately I've never gone broke.\n\n43:39.140 --> 43:40.820\n You mean like full life?\n\n43:40.820 --> 43:42.460\n Full life, no.\n\n43:42.460 --> 43:44.060\n I know plenty of people who have.\n\n43:46.740 --> 43:48.180\n And I don't think Igor would mind me saying he went,\n\n43:48.180 --> 43:50.300\n you know, he went broke once in poker bowl, you know,\n\n43:50.300 --> 43:51.820\n early on when we were together.\n\n43:51.820 --> 43:54.260\n I feel like you haven't lived unless you've gone broke.\n\n43:54.260 --> 43:55.660\n Oh yeah.\n\n43:55.660 --> 43:56.500\n Some sense.\n\n43:56.500 --> 43:57.340\n Right.\n\n43:57.340 --> 43:58.180\n Some fundamental sense.\n\n43:58.180 --> 43:59.900\n I mean, I'm happy, I've sort of lived through it,\n\n43:59.900 --> 44:02.420\n vicariously through him when he did it at the time.\n\n44:02.420 --> 44:04.140\n But yeah, what's it like to lose?\n\n44:04.140 --> 44:04.980\n Well, it depends.\n\n44:04.980 --> 44:06.020\n So it depends on the amount.\n\n44:06.020 --> 44:07.660\n It depends what percentage of your net worth\n\n44:07.660 --> 44:08.580\n you've just lost.\n\n44:10.060 --> 44:11.540\n It depends on your brain chemistry.\n\n44:11.540 --> 44:13.140\n It really, you know, varies from person to person.\n\n44:13.140 --> 44:16.900\n You have a very cold calculating way of thinking about this.\n\n44:16.900 --> 44:18.980\n So it depends what percentage.\n\n44:18.980 --> 44:20.700\n Well, it did, it really does, right?\n\n44:20.700 --> 44:22.140\n Yeah, it's true, it's true.\n\n44:22.140 --> 44:24.740\n I mean, that's another thing poker trains you to do.\n\n44:24.740 --> 44:28.060\n You see, you see everything in percentages\n\n44:28.060 --> 44:30.820\n or you see everything in like ROI or expected hourlies\n\n44:30.820 --> 44:32.420\n or cost benefit, et cetera.\n\n44:32.420 --> 44:37.220\n You know, so that's, one of the things I've tried to do\n\n44:37.220 --> 44:39.820\n is calibrate the strength of my emotional response\n\n44:39.820 --> 44:43.380\n to the win or loss that I've received.\n\n44:43.380 --> 44:45.540\n Because it's no good if you like, you know,\n\n44:45.540 --> 44:49.340\n you have a huge emotional dramatic response to a tiny loss\n\n44:50.460 --> 44:53.220\n or on the flip side, you have a huge win\n\n44:53.220 --> 44:54.580\n and you're sort of so dead inside\n\n44:54.580 --> 44:55.420\n that you don't even feel it.\n\n44:55.420 --> 44:56.820\n Well, that's, you know, that's a shame.\n\n44:56.820 --> 45:00.220\n I want my emotions to calibrate with reality\n\n45:00.220 --> 45:01.420\n as much as possible.\n\n45:02.860 --> 45:04.180\n So yeah, what's it like to lose?\n\n45:04.180 --> 45:07.180\n I mean, I've had times where I've lost, you know,\n\n45:07.180 --> 45:09.260\n busted out of a tournament that I thought I was gonna win in\n\n45:09.260 --> 45:13.060\n especially if I got really unlucky or I make a dumb play\n\n45:13.940 --> 45:17.540\n where I've gone away and like, you know, kicked the wall,\n\n45:17.540 --> 45:19.900\n punched a wall, I like nearly broke my hand one time.\n\n45:19.900 --> 45:24.100\n Like I'm a lot less competitive than I used to be.\n\n45:24.100 --> 45:27.540\n Like I was like pathologically competitive in my like\n\n45:27.540 --> 45:30.900\n late teens, early twenties, I just had to win at everything.\n\n45:30.900 --> 45:33.540\n And I think that sort of slowly waned as I've gotten older.\n\n45:33.540 --> 45:34.860\n According to you, yeah.\n\n45:34.860 --> 45:35.700\n According to me.\n\n45:35.700 --> 45:38.500\n I don't know if others would say the same, right?\n\n45:38.500 --> 45:40.860\n I feel like ultra competitive people,\n\n45:40.860 --> 45:43.020\n like I've heard Joe Rogan say this to me.\n\n45:43.020 --> 45:44.780\n It's like that he's a lot less competitive\n\n45:44.780 --> 45:45.620\n than he used to be.\n\n45:45.620 --> 45:47.380\n I don't know about that.\n\n45:47.380 --> 45:48.420\n Oh, I believe it.\n\n45:48.420 --> 45:49.260\n No, I totally believe it.\n\n45:49.260 --> 45:51.460\n Like, because as you get, you can still be,\n\n45:51.460 --> 45:53.020\n like I care about winning.\n\n45:53.020 --> 45:56.060\n Like when, you know, I play a game with my buddies online\n\n45:56.060 --> 45:57.460\n or, you know, whatever it is,\n\n45:57.460 --> 45:58.780\n polytopia is my current obsession.\n\n45:58.780 --> 46:00.820\n Like when I.\n\n46:00.820 --> 46:02.980\n Thank you for passing on your obsession to me.\n\n46:02.980 --> 46:03.820\n Are you playing now?\n\n46:03.820 --> 46:04.780\n Yeah, I'm playing now.\n\n46:04.780 --> 46:05.900\n We gotta have a game.\n\n46:05.900 --> 46:08.140\n But I'm terrible and I enjoy playing terribly.\n\n46:08.140 --> 46:10.060\n I don't wanna have a game because that's gonna pull me\n\n46:10.060 --> 46:13.940\n into your monster of like a competitive play.\n\n46:13.940 --> 46:15.420\n It's important, it's an important skill.\n\n46:15.420 --> 46:18.340\n I'm enjoying playing on the, I can't.\n\n46:18.340 --> 46:20.980\n You just do the points thing, you know, against the bots.\n\n46:20.980 --> 46:22.020\n Yeah, against the bots.\n\n46:22.020 --> 46:26.100\n And I can't even do the, there's like a hard one\n\n46:26.100 --> 46:26.940\n and there's a very hard one.\n\n46:26.940 --> 46:27.820\n And then it's crazy, yeah.\n\n46:27.820 --> 46:28.660\n It's crazy.\n\n46:28.660 --> 46:29.900\n I can't, I don't even enjoy the hard one.\n\n46:29.900 --> 46:32.020\n The crazy, I really don't enjoy.\n\n46:32.020 --> 46:33.660\n Cause it's intense.\n\n46:33.660 --> 46:34.980\n You have to constantly try to win\n\n46:34.980 --> 46:37.980\n as opposed to enjoy building a little world and.\n\n46:37.980 --> 46:38.820\n Yeah, no, no, no.\n\n46:38.820 --> 46:40.100\n There's no time for exploration in polytopia.\n\n46:40.100 --> 46:40.940\n You gotta get.\n\n46:40.940 --> 46:42.740\n Well, when, once you graduate from the crazies,\n\n46:42.740 --> 46:44.540\n then you can come play the.\n\n46:44.540 --> 46:46.460\n Graduate from the crazies.\n\n46:46.460 --> 46:48.620\n Yeah, so in order to be able to play a decent game\n\n46:48.620 --> 46:51.700\n against like, you know, our group,\n\n46:51.700 --> 46:55.740\n you'll need to be, you'll need to be consistently winning\n\n46:55.740 --> 46:58.300\n like 90% of games against 15 crazy bots.\n\n46:58.300 --> 46:59.180\n Yeah.\n\n46:59.180 --> 47:00.740\n And you'll be able to, like there'll be,\n\n47:00.740 --> 47:03.340\n I could teach you it within a day, honestly.\n\n47:03.340 --> 47:04.660\n How to beat the crazies?\n\n47:04.660 --> 47:05.740\n How to beat the crazies.\n\n47:05.740 --> 47:08.140\n And then, and then you'll be ready for the big leagues.\n\n47:08.140 --> 47:11.060\n Generalizes to more than just polytopia.\n\n47:11.060 --> 47:14.420\n But okay, why were we talking about polytopia?\n\n47:14.420 --> 47:15.980\n Losing hurts.\n\n47:15.980 --> 47:17.060\n Losing hurts, oh yeah.\n\n47:17.060 --> 47:19.380\n Yes, competitiveness over time.\n\n47:19.380 --> 47:20.340\n Oh yeah.\n\n47:20.340 --> 47:23.340\n I think it's more that, at least for me,\n\n47:23.340 --> 47:24.740\n I still care about playing,\n\n47:24.740 --> 47:26.460\n about winning when I choose to play something.\n\n47:26.460 --> 47:28.700\n It's just that I don't see the world\n\n47:28.700 --> 47:31.860\n as zero sum as I used to be, you know?\n\n47:31.860 --> 47:34.940\n I think as one gets older and wiser,\n\n47:34.940 --> 47:38.060\n you start to see the world more as a positive something.\n\n47:38.060 --> 47:40.820\n Or at least you're more aware of externalities,\n\n47:40.820 --> 47:43.740\n of scenarios, of competitive interactions.\n\n47:43.740 --> 47:47.180\n And so, yeah, I just like, I'm more,\n\n47:47.180 --> 47:50.180\n and I'm more aware of my own, you know, like,\n\n47:50.180 --> 47:52.780\n if I have a really strong emotional response to losing,\n\n47:52.780 --> 47:54.980\n and that makes me then feel shitty for the rest of the day,\n\n47:54.980 --> 47:57.220\n and then I beat myself up mentally for it.\n\n47:57.220 --> 47:58.660\n Like, I'm now more aware\n\n47:58.660 --> 48:01.660\n that that's unnecessary negative externality.\n\n48:01.660 --> 48:03.940\n So I'm like, okay, I need to find a way to turn this down,\n\n48:03.940 --> 48:05.300\n you know, dial this down a bit.\n\n48:05.300 --> 48:07.580\n Was poker the thing that has,\n\n48:07.580 --> 48:09.700\n if you think back at your life,\n\n48:09.700 --> 48:12.180\n and think about some of the lower points of your life,\n\n48:12.180 --> 48:15.020\n like the darker places you've got in your mind,\n\n48:15.020 --> 48:17.140\n did it have to do something with poker?\n\n48:17.140 --> 48:22.140\n Like, did losing spark the descent into darkness,\n\n48:23.620 --> 48:24.940\n or was it something else?\n\n48:27.540 --> 48:29.460\n I think my darkest points in poker\n\n48:29.460 --> 48:34.460\n were when I was wanting to quit and move on to other things,\n\n48:34.500 --> 48:38.340\n but I felt like I hadn't ticked all the boxes\n\n48:38.340 --> 48:39.980\n I wanted to tick.\n\n48:39.980 --> 48:43.740\n Like, I wanted to be the most winningest female player,\n\n48:43.740 --> 48:45.540\n which is by itself a bad goal.\n\n48:45.540 --> 48:47.940\n You know, that was one of my initial goals,\n\n48:47.940 --> 48:48.900\n and I was like, well, I haven't, you know,\n\n48:48.900 --> 48:50.900\n and I wanted to win a WPT event.\n\n48:50.900 --> 48:52.100\n I've won one of these, I've won one of these,\n\n48:52.100 --> 48:53.540\n but I want one of those as well.\n\n48:53.540 --> 48:57.380\n And that sort of, again, like,\n\n48:57.380 --> 49:00.060\n it's a drive of like overoptimization to random metrics\n\n49:00.060 --> 49:01.540\n that I decided were important\n\n49:02.420 --> 49:05.220\n without much wisdom at the time, but then like carried on.\n\n49:06.540 --> 49:09.540\n That made me continue chasing it longer\n\n49:09.540 --> 49:12.860\n than I still actually had the passion to chase it for.\n\n49:12.860 --> 49:15.740\n And I don't have any regrets that, you know,\n\n49:15.740 --> 49:17.540\n I played for as long as I did, because who knows,\n\n49:17.540 --> 49:19.260\n you know, I wouldn't be sitting here,\n\n49:19.260 --> 49:21.020\n I wouldn't be living this incredible life\n\n49:21.020 --> 49:22.660\n that I'm living now.\n\n49:22.660 --> 49:24.860\n This is the height of your life right now.\n\n49:24.860 --> 49:28.100\n This is it, peak experience, absolute pinnacle\n\n49:28.100 --> 49:33.100\n here in your robot land with your creepy light.\n\n49:34.500 --> 49:37.340\n No, it is, I mean, I wouldn't change a thing\n\n49:37.340 --> 49:40.900\n about my life right now, and I feel very blessed to say that.\n\n49:40.900 --> 49:45.900\n So, but the dark times were in the sort of like 2016 to 18,\n\n49:47.980 --> 49:50.340\n even sooner really, where I was like,\n\n49:50.340 --> 49:53.100\n I had stopped loving the game,\n\n49:53.100 --> 49:55.420\n and I was going through the motions,\n\n49:55.420 --> 49:59.660\n and I would, and then I was like, you know,\n\n49:59.660 --> 50:02.220\n I would take the losses harder than I needed to,\n\n50:02.220 --> 50:03.380\n because I'm like, ah, it's another one.\n\n50:03.380 --> 50:04.820\n And it was, I was aware that like,\n\n50:04.820 --> 50:06.180\n I felt like my life was ticking away,\n\n50:06.180 --> 50:07.940\n and I was like, is this gonna be what's on my tombstone?\n\n50:07.940 --> 50:09.580\n Oh yeah, she played the game of, you know,\n\n50:09.580 --> 50:11.700\n this zero sum game of poker,\n\n50:11.700 --> 50:14.100\n slightly more optimally than her next opponent.\n\n50:14.100 --> 50:16.380\n Like, cool, great, legacy, you know?\n\n50:16.380 --> 50:19.660\n So, I just wanted, you know, there was something in me\n\n50:19.660 --> 50:21.340\n that knew I needed to be doing something\n\n50:21.340 --> 50:25.260\n more directly impactful and just meaningful.\n\n50:25.260 --> 50:26.260\n It was just like your search for meaning,\n\n50:26.260 --> 50:27.940\n and I think it's a thing a lot of poker players,\n\n50:27.940 --> 50:30.900\n even a lot of, I imagine any games players\n\n50:30.900 --> 50:34.500\n who sort of love intellectual pursuits,\n\n50:36.100 --> 50:37.660\n you know, I think you should ask Magnus Carlsen\n\n50:37.660 --> 50:38.500\n this question, I don't know what he's on.\n\n50:38.500 --> 50:39.780\n He's walking away from chess, right?\n\n50:39.780 --> 50:41.500\n Yeah, like, it must be so hard for him.\n\n50:41.500 --> 50:43.740\n You know, he's been on the top for so long,\n\n50:43.740 --> 50:45.300\n and it's like, well, now what?\n\n50:45.300 --> 50:48.700\n He's got this incredible brain, like, what to put it to?\n\n50:49.980 --> 50:52.100\n And, yeah, it's.\n\n50:52.100 --> 50:55.620\n It's this weird moment where I've just spoken with people\n\n50:55.620 --> 50:58.380\n that won multiple gold medals at the Olympics,\n\n50:58.380 --> 51:01.540\n and the depression hits hard after you win.\n\n51:02.860 --> 51:04.180\n Dopamine crash.\n\n51:04.180 --> 51:05.620\n Because it's a kind of a goodbye,\n\n51:05.620 --> 51:06.900\n saying goodbye to that person,\n\n51:06.900 --> 51:09.420\n to all the dreams you had that thought,\n\n51:09.420 --> 51:11.860\n you thought would give meaning to your life,\n\n51:11.860 --> 51:16.820\n but in fact, life is full of constant pursuits of meaning.\n\n51:16.820 --> 51:20.260\n It doesn't, you don't like arrive and figure it all out,\n\n51:20.260 --> 51:21.700\n and there's endless bliss,\n\n51:21.700 --> 51:23.980\n and it continues going on and on.\n\n51:23.980 --> 51:27.860\n You constantly have to figure out to rediscover yourself.\n\n51:27.860 --> 51:31.580\n And so for you, like that struggle to say goodbye to poker,\n\n51:31.580 --> 51:33.780\n you have to like find the next.\n\n51:33.780 --> 51:34.940\n There's always a bigger game.\n\n51:34.940 --> 51:35.780\n That's the thing.\n\n51:35.780 --> 51:38.460\n That's my motto is like, what's the next game?\n\n51:38.460 --> 51:41.220\n And more importantly,\n\n51:41.220 --> 51:43.140\n because obviously game usually implies zero sum,\n\n51:43.140 --> 51:46.580\n like what's a game which is like Omni win?\n\n51:46.580 --> 51:47.700\n Like what? Omni win.\n\n51:47.700 --> 51:48.540\n Omni win.\n\n51:48.540 --> 51:50.740\n Why is Omni win so important?\n\n51:50.740 --> 51:54.700\n Because if everyone plays zero sum games,\n\n51:54.700 --> 51:57.180\n that's a fast track to either completely stagnate\n\n51:57.180 --> 51:59.220\n as a civilization, but more actually,\n\n51:59.220 --> 52:01.340\n far more likely to extinct ourselves.\n\n52:02.300 --> 52:05.020\n You know, like the playing field is finite.\n\n52:05.020 --> 52:09.620\n You know, nuclear powers are playing,\n\n52:09.620 --> 52:12.020\n you know, a game of poker with, you know,\n\n52:12.020 --> 52:14.500\n but their chips are nuclear weapons, right?\n\n52:14.500 --> 52:17.020\n And the stakes have gotten so large\n\n52:17.020 --> 52:19.140\n that if anyone makes a single bet, you know,\n\n52:19.140 --> 52:22.100\n fires some weapons, the playing field breaks.\n\n52:22.100 --> 52:22.940\n I made a video on this.\n\n52:22.940 --> 52:26.900\n Like, you know, the playing field is finite.\n\n52:26.900 --> 52:31.540\n And if we keep playing these adversarial zero sum games,\n\n52:31.540 --> 52:33.180\n thinking that we, you know,\n\n52:33.180 --> 52:35.420\n in order for us to win, someone else has to lose,\n\n52:35.420 --> 52:37.740\n or if we lose that, you know, someone else wins,\n\n52:37.740 --> 52:40.020\n that will extinct us.\n\n52:40.020 --> 52:41.100\n It's just a matter of when.\n\n52:41.100 --> 52:44.860\n What do you think about that mutually assured destruction,\n\n52:44.860 --> 52:46.340\n that very simple,\n\n52:46.340 --> 52:49.980\n almost to the point of caricaturing game theory idea\n\n52:49.980 --> 52:52.340\n that does seem to be at the core\n\n52:52.340 --> 52:54.060\n of why we haven't blown each other up yet\n\n52:54.060 --> 52:55.660\n with nuclear weapons.\n\n52:55.660 --> 52:57.540\n Do you think there's some truth to that,\n\n52:57.540 --> 53:00.180\n this kind of stabilizing force\n\n53:00.180 --> 53:01.500\n of mutually assured destruction?\n\n53:01.500 --> 53:04.940\n And do you think that's gonna hold up\n\n53:04.940 --> 53:07.340\n through the 21st century?\n\n53:07.340 --> 53:09.980\n I mean, it has held.\n\n53:09.980 --> 53:11.700\n Yes, there's definitely truth to it,\n\n53:11.700 --> 53:14.740\n that it was a, you know, it's a Nash equilibrium.\n\n53:14.740 --> 53:17.300\n Yeah, are you surprised it held this long?\n\n53:17.300 --> 53:18.460\n Isn't it crazy?\n\n53:18.460 --> 53:21.140\n It is crazy when you factor in all the like\n\n53:21.140 --> 53:24.620\n near miss accidental firings.\n\n53:24.620 --> 53:28.060\n Yes, that's makes me wonder like, you know,\n\n53:28.060 --> 53:29.900\n are you familiar with the like quantum suicide\n\n53:29.900 --> 53:33.020\n thought experiment, where it's basically like,\n\n53:33.020 --> 53:36.580\n you have a, you know, like a Russian roulette\n\n53:36.580 --> 53:40.620\n type scenario hooked up to some kind of quantum event,\n\n53:40.620 --> 53:45.620\n you know, particle splitting or pair of particles splitting.\n\n53:45.820 --> 53:48.420\n And if it, you know, if it goes A,\n\n53:48.420 --> 53:50.260\n then the gun doesn't go off and it goes B,\n\n53:50.260 --> 53:52.500\n then it does go off and it kills you.\n\n53:52.500 --> 53:55.020\n Because you can only ever be in the universe,\n\n53:55.020 --> 53:56.540\n you know, assuming like the Everett branch,\n\n53:56.540 --> 53:57.780\n you know, multiverse theory,\n\n53:57.780 --> 54:00.220\n you'll always only end up in the branch\n\n54:00.220 --> 54:03.340\n where you continually make, you know, option A comes in,\n\n54:03.340 --> 54:05.460\n but you run that experiment enough times,\n\n54:05.460 --> 54:07.060\n it starts getting pretty damn, you know,\n\n54:07.060 --> 54:09.380\n out of the tree gets huge,\n\n54:09.380 --> 54:10.900\n there's a million different scenarios,\n\n54:10.900 --> 54:12.420\n but you'll always find yourself in this,\n\n54:12.420 --> 54:14.860\n in the one where it didn't go off.\n\n54:14.860 --> 54:19.860\n And so from that perspective, you are essentially immortal\n\n54:20.780 --> 54:22.580\n because someone, and you will only find yourself\n\n54:22.580 --> 54:25.100\n in the set of observers that make it down that path.\n\n54:25.100 --> 54:26.620\n So it's kind of a...\n\n54:26.620 --> 54:30.420\n That doesn't mean, that doesn't mean\n\n54:30.420 --> 54:33.140\n you're still not gonna be fucked at some point in your life.\n\n54:33.140 --> 54:34.860\n No, of course not, no, I'm not advocating\n\n54:34.860 --> 54:36.420\n like that we're all immortal because of this.\n\n54:36.420 --> 54:38.460\n It's just like a fun thought experiment.\n\n54:38.460 --> 54:40.100\n And the point is it like raises this thing\n\n54:40.100 --> 54:42.380\n of like these things called observer selection effects,\n\n54:42.380 --> 54:44.420\n which Bostrom, Nick Bostrom talks about a lot,\n\n54:44.420 --> 54:46.180\n and I think people should go read.\n\n54:46.180 --> 54:47.020\n It's really powerful,\n\n54:47.020 --> 54:48.860\n but I think it could be overextended, that logic.\n\n54:48.860 --> 54:52.220\n I'm not sure exactly how it can be.\n\n54:52.220 --> 54:57.220\n I just feel like you can get, you can overgeneralize\n\n54:57.300 --> 54:58.340\n that logic somehow.\n\n54:58.340 --> 55:00.660\n Well, no, I mean, it leaves you into like solipsism,\n\n55:00.660 --> 55:02.140\n which is a very dangerous mindset.\n\n55:02.140 --> 55:04.340\n Again, if everyone like falls into solipsism of like,\n\n55:04.340 --> 55:05.740\n well, I'll be fine.\n\n55:05.740 --> 55:08.820\n That's a great way of creating a very,\n\n55:08.820 --> 55:10.860\n self terminating environment.\n\n55:10.860 --> 55:14.540\n But my point is, is that with the nuclear weapons thing,\n\n55:14.540 --> 55:19.540\n there have been at least, I think it's 12 or 11 near misses\n\n55:19.540 --> 55:22.940\n of like just stupid things, like there was moonrise\n\n55:22.940 --> 55:25.860\n over Norway, and it made weird reflections\n\n55:25.860 --> 55:28.820\n of some glaciers in the mountains, which set off,\n\n55:28.820 --> 55:33.820\n I think the alarms of NORAD radar,\n\n55:33.820 --> 55:35.700\n and that put them on high alert, nearly ready to shoot.\n\n55:35.700 --> 55:39.540\n And it was only because the head of Russian military\n\n55:39.540 --> 55:41.980\n happened to be at the UN in New York at the time\n\n55:41.980 --> 55:43.300\n that they go like, well, wait a second,\n\n55:43.300 --> 55:47.140\n why would they fire now when their guy is there?\n\n55:47.140 --> 55:49.260\n And it was only that lucky happenstance,\n\n55:49.260 --> 55:50.900\n which doesn't happen very often where they didn't then\n\n55:50.900 --> 55:51.980\n escalate it into firing.\n\n55:51.980 --> 55:53.860\n And there's a bunch of these different ones.\n\n55:53.860 --> 55:56.660\n Stanislav Petrov, like saved the person\n\n55:56.660 --> 55:57.940\n who should be the most famous person on earth,\n\n55:57.940 --> 55:59.580\n cause he's probably on expectation,\n\n55:59.580 --> 56:01.180\n saved the most human lives of anyone,\n\n56:01.180 --> 56:05.300\n like billions of people by ignoring Russian orders to fire\n\n56:05.300 --> 56:06.700\n because he felt in his gut that actually\n\n56:06.700 --> 56:07.540\n this was a false alarm.\n\n56:07.540 --> 56:11.060\n And it turned out to be, you know, very hard thing to do.\n\n56:11.060 --> 56:13.500\n And there's so many of those scenarios that I can't help\n\n56:13.500 --> 56:15.900\n but wonder at this point that we aren't having this kind\n\n56:15.900 --> 56:17.940\n of like selection effect thing going on.\n\n56:17.940 --> 56:19.820\n Cause you look back and you're like, geez,\n\n56:19.820 --> 56:20.820\n that's a lot of near misses.\n\n56:20.820 --> 56:22.860\n But of course we don't know the actual probabilities\n\n56:22.860 --> 56:24.340\n that they would have lent each one would have ended up\n\n56:24.340 --> 56:25.180\n in nuclear war.\n\n56:25.180 --> 56:27.740\n Maybe they were not that likely, but still the point is,\n\n56:27.740 --> 56:30.900\n it's a very dark, stupid game that we're playing.\n\n56:30.900 --> 56:35.340\n And it is an absolute moral imperative if you ask me\n\n56:35.340 --> 56:37.220\n to get as many people thinking about ways\n\n56:37.220 --> 56:39.540\n to make this like very precarious.\n\n56:39.540 --> 56:41.140\n Cause we're in a Nash equilibrium,\n\n56:41.140 --> 56:42.820\n but it's not like we're in the bottom of a pit.\n\n56:42.820 --> 56:46.380\n You know, if you would like map it topographically,\n\n56:46.380 --> 56:48.380\n it's not like a stable ball at the bottom of a thing.\n\n56:48.380 --> 56:49.420\n We're not in equilibrium because of that.\n\n56:49.420 --> 56:52.380\n We're on the top of a hill with a ball balanced on top.\n\n56:52.380 --> 56:55.580\n And just at any little nudge could send it flying down\n\n56:55.580 --> 56:57.100\n and you know, nuclear war pops off\n\n56:57.100 --> 56:58.900\n and hellfire and bad times.\n\n57:00.060 --> 57:01.100\n On the positive side,\n\n57:01.100 --> 57:03.220\n life on earth will probably still continue.\n\n57:03.220 --> 57:06.220\n And another intelligent civilization might still pop up.\n\n57:06.220 --> 57:07.060\n Maybe.\n\n57:07.060 --> 57:08.420\n Several millennia after.\n\n57:08.420 --> 57:10.180\n Pick your X risk, depends on the X risk.\n\n57:10.180 --> 57:11.020\n Nuclear war, sure.\n\n57:11.020 --> 57:12.820\n That's one of the perhaps less bad ones.\n\n57:12.820 --> 57:17.620\n Green goo through synthetic biology, very bad.\n\n57:17.620 --> 57:22.220\n Will turn, you know, destroy all, you know,\n\n57:22.220 --> 57:25.740\n organic matter through, you know,\n\n57:25.740 --> 57:28.140\n it's basically like a biological paperclip maximizer.\n\n57:28.140 --> 57:28.980\n Also bad.\n\n57:28.980 --> 57:32.540\n Or AI type, you know, mass extinction thing as well\n\n57:32.540 --> 57:33.380\n would also be bad.\n\n57:33.380 --> 57:35.060\n Shh, they're listening.\n\n57:35.060 --> 57:36.500\n There's a robot right behind you.\n\n57:36.500 --> 57:37.340\n Okay, wait.\n\n57:37.340 --> 57:40.380\n So let me ask you about this from a game theory perspective.\n\n57:40.380 --> 57:42.300\n Do you think we're living in a simulation?\n\n57:42.300 --> 57:44.700\n Do you think we're living inside a video game\n\n57:44.700 --> 57:45.980\n created by somebody else?\n\n57:48.100 --> 57:50.220\n Well, so what was the second part of the question?\n\n57:50.220 --> 57:52.620\n Do I think we're living in a simulation and?\n\n57:52.620 --> 57:56.660\n A simulation that is observed by somebody\n\n57:56.660 --> 57:58.620\n for purpose of entertainment.\n\n57:58.620 --> 57:59.660\n So like a video game.\n\n57:59.660 --> 58:00.500\n Are we listening?\n\n58:00.500 --> 58:03.140\n Are we, because there's a,\n\n58:03.140 --> 58:05.260\n it's like Phil Hellmuth type of situation, right?\n\n58:05.260 --> 58:09.940\n Like there's a creepy level of like,\n\n58:09.940 --> 58:12.660\n this is kind of fun and interesting.\n\n58:13.700 --> 58:16.940\n Like there's a lot of interesting stuff going on.\n\n58:16.940 --> 58:18.820\n Maybe that could be somehow integrated\n\n58:18.820 --> 58:23.660\n into the evolutionary process where the way we perceive\n\n58:23.660 --> 58:24.500\n and are.\n\n58:24.500 --> 58:26.020\n Are you asking me if I believe in God?\n\n58:27.340 --> 58:28.820\n Sounds like it.\n\n58:28.820 --> 58:33.820\n Kind of, but God seems to be not optimizing\n\n58:33.980 --> 58:37.420\n in the different formulations of God that we conceive of.\n\n58:37.420 --> 58:39.940\n He doesn't seem to be, or she, optimizing\n\n58:39.940 --> 58:42.700\n for like personal entertainment.\n\n58:44.220 --> 58:45.860\n Maybe the older gods did.\n\n58:45.860 --> 58:49.820\n But the, you know, just like, basically like a teenager\n\n58:49.820 --> 58:54.180\n in their mom's basement watching, create a fun universe\n\n58:54.180 --> 58:58.500\n to observe what kind of crazy shit might happen.\n\n58:58.500 --> 59:00.100\n Okay, so to try and answer this.\n\n59:00.100 --> 59:05.100\n Do I think there is some kind of extraneous intelligence\n\n59:11.340 --> 59:16.220\n to like our, you know, classic measurable universe\n\n59:16.220 --> 59:18.220\n that we, you know, can measure with, you know,\n\n59:18.220 --> 59:23.220\n through our current physics and instruments?\n\n59:23.780 --> 59:25.100\n I think so, yes.\n\n59:25.100 --> 59:29.100\n Partly because I've had just small little bits of evidence\n\n59:29.100 --> 59:32.300\n in my own life, which have made me question.\n\n59:32.300 --> 59:36.300\n Like, so I was a diehard atheist, even five years ago.\n\n59:37.460 --> 59:39.820\n You know, I got into like the rationality community,\n\n59:39.820 --> 59:43.820\n big fan of less wrong, continue to be an incredible resource.\n\n59:45.140 --> 59:49.140\n But I've just started to have too many little snippets\n\n59:49.140 --> 59:54.140\n of experience, which don't make sense with the current sort\n\n59:54.140 --> 59:59.140\n of purely materialistic explanation of how reality works.\n\n1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:09.540\n Isn't that just like a humbling, practical realization\n\n1:00:09.540 --> 1:00:12.540\n that we don't know how reality works?\n\n1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:15.620\n Isn't that just a reminder to yourself that you're\n\n1:00:15.620 --> 1:00:19.340\n like, I don't know how reality works, isn't that just\n\n1:00:19.340 --> 1:00:20.180\n a reminder to yourself?\n\n1:00:20.180 --> 1:00:22.500\n Yeah, no, it's a reminder of epistemic humility\n\n1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:25.460\n because I fell too hard, you know, same as people,\n\n1:00:25.460 --> 1:00:27.580\n like I think, you know, many people who are just like,\n\n1:00:27.580 --> 1:00:29.380\n my religion is the way, this is the correct way,\n\n1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:32.260\n this is the work, this is the law, you are immoral\n\n1:00:32.260 --> 1:00:33.620\n if you don't follow this, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:00:33.620 --> 1:00:36.060\n I think they are lacking epistemic humility.\n\n1:00:36.060 --> 1:00:38.100\n They're a little too much hubris there.\n\n1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.380\n But similarly, I think that sort of the Richard Dawkins\n\n1:00:40.380 --> 1:00:45.380\n realism is too rigid as well and doesn't, you know,\n\n1:00:48.580 --> 1:00:51.020\n there's a way to try and navigate these questions\n\n1:00:51.020 --> 1:00:52.780\n which still honors the scientific method,\n\n1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:54.820\n which I still think is our best sort of realm\n\n1:00:54.820 --> 1:00:57.620\n of like reasonable inquiry, you know, a method of inquiry.\n\n1:00:58.940 --> 1:01:03.340\n So an example, two kind of notable examples\n\n1:01:03.340 --> 1:01:06.660\n that like really rattled my cage.\n\n1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:09.340\n The first one was actually in 2010 early on\n\n1:01:09.340 --> 1:01:13.460\n in quite early on in my poker career.\n\n1:01:13.460 --> 1:01:18.460\n And I, remember the Icelandic volcano that erupted\n\n1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:22.700\n that like shut down kind of all Atlantic airspace.\n\n1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:25.260\n And it meant I got stuck down in the South of France.\n\n1:01:25.260 --> 1:01:27.140\n I was there for something else.\n\n1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:29.900\n And I couldn't get home and someone said,\n\n1:01:29.900 --> 1:01:31.860\n well, there's a big poker tournament happening in Italy.\n\n1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:32.980\n Maybe, do you wanna go?\n\n1:01:32.980 --> 1:01:33.820\n I was like, all right, sure.\n\n1:01:33.820 --> 1:01:35.860\n Like, let's, you know, got a train across,\n\n1:01:35.860 --> 1:01:37.860\n found a way to get there.\n\n1:01:37.860 --> 1:01:39.860\n And the buy in was 5,000 euros,\n\n1:01:39.860 --> 1:01:42.500\n which was much bigger than my bankroll would normally allow.\n\n1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:46.620\n And so I played a feeder tournament, won my way in\n\n1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:49.820\n kind of like I did with the Monte Carlo big one.\n\n1:01:49.820 --> 1:01:50.900\n So then I won my way, you know,\n\n1:01:50.900 --> 1:01:54.180\n from 500 euros into 5,000 euros to play this thing.\n\n1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:57.980\n And on day one of then the big tournament,\n\n1:01:57.980 --> 1:01:58.980\n which turned out to have,\n\n1:01:58.980 --> 1:02:00.860\n it was the biggest tournament ever held in Europe\n\n1:02:00.860 --> 1:02:01.700\n at the time.\n\n1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:04.540\n It got over like 1,200 people, absolutely huge.\n\n1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:08.380\n And I remember they dimmed the lights for before, you know,\n\n1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:10.220\n the normal shuffle up and deal\n\n1:02:10.220 --> 1:02:12.100\n to tell everyone to start playing.\n\n1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:16.100\n And they played Chemical Brothers, Hey Boy, Hey Girl,\n\n1:02:16.100 --> 1:02:17.380\n which I don't know why it's notable,\n\n1:02:17.380 --> 1:02:18.380\n but it was just like a really,\n\n1:02:18.380 --> 1:02:19.220\n it was a song I always liked.\n\n1:02:19.220 --> 1:02:21.220\n It was like one of these like pump me up songs.\n\n1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:22.900\n And I was sitting there thinking, oh yeah, it's exciting.\n\n1:02:22.900 --> 1:02:24.580\n I'm playing this really big tournament.\n\n1:02:24.580 --> 1:02:29.380\n And out of nowhere, just suddenly this voice in my head,\n\n1:02:29.380 --> 1:02:32.220\n just, and it sounded like my own sort of, you know,\n\n1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:34.980\n when you think in your mind, you hear a voice kind of, right?\n\n1:02:34.980 --> 1:02:35.820\n At least I do.\n\n1:02:36.780 --> 1:02:38.620\n And so it sounded like my own voice and it said,\n\n1:02:38.620 --> 1:02:41.220\n you are going to win this tournament.\n\n1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:44.220\n And it was so powerful that I got this like wave of like,\n\n1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:46.780\n you know, sort of goosebumps down my body.\n\n1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:48.780\n And that I even, I remember looking around being like,\n\n1:02:48.780 --> 1:02:49.820\n did anyone else hear that?\n\n1:02:49.820 --> 1:02:51.020\n And obviously people are in their phones,\n\n1:02:51.020 --> 1:02:51.860\n like no one else heard it.\n\n1:02:51.860 --> 1:02:56.700\n And I was like, okay, six days later,\n\n1:02:56.700 --> 1:02:59.780\n I win the fucking tournament out of 1,200 people.\n\n1:02:59.780 --> 1:03:04.780\n And I don't know how to explain it.\n\n1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:13.380\n Okay, yes, maybe I have that feeling\n\n1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.620\n before every time I play.\n\n1:03:14.620 --> 1:03:16.140\n And it's just that I happened to, you know,\n\n1:03:16.140 --> 1:03:18.820\n because I won the tournament, I retroactively remembered it.\n\n1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:19.660\n But that's just.\n\n1:03:19.660 --> 1:03:22.300\n Or the feeling gave you a kind of,\n\n1:03:22.300 --> 1:03:24.940\n now from the film, Helmutian.\n\n1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:25.780\n Well, exactly.\n\n1:03:25.780 --> 1:03:28.340\n Like it gave you a confident, a deep confidence.\n\n1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:29.180\n And it did.\n\n1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:30.020\n It definitely did.\n\n1:03:30.020 --> 1:03:32.060\n Like, I remember then feeling this like sort of,\n\n1:03:32.060 --> 1:03:33.980\n well, although I remember then on day one,\n\n1:03:33.980 --> 1:03:35.900\n I then went and lost half my stack quite early on.\n\n1:03:35.900 --> 1:03:37.700\n And I remember thinking like, oh, well, that was bullshit.\n\n1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:40.260\n You know, what kind of premonition is this?\n\n1:03:40.260 --> 1:03:41.100\n Thinking, oh, I'm out.\n\n1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:42.940\n But you know, I managed to like keep it together\n\n1:03:42.940 --> 1:03:46.060\n and recover and then just went like pretty perfectly\n\n1:03:46.060 --> 1:03:47.420\n from then on.\n\n1:03:47.420 --> 1:03:51.100\n And either way, it definitely instilled me\n\n1:03:51.100 --> 1:03:52.780\n with this confidence.\n\n1:03:52.780 --> 1:03:55.820\n And I don't want to put, I can't put an explanation.\n\n1:03:55.820 --> 1:04:00.820\n Like, you know, was it some, you know, huge extra to extra,\n\n1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:03.980\n you know, supernatural thing driving me?\n\n1:04:03.980 --> 1:04:06.540\n Or was it just my own self confidence in someone\n\n1:04:06.540 --> 1:04:07.980\n that just made me make the right decisions?\n\n1:04:07.980 --> 1:04:08.860\n I don't know.\n\n1:04:08.860 --> 1:04:10.660\n And I don't, I'm not going to put a frame on it.\n\n1:04:10.660 --> 1:04:11.500\n And I think.\n\n1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:12.420\n I think I know a good explanation.\n\n1:04:12.420 --> 1:04:14.740\n So we're a bunch of NPCs living in this world\n\n1:04:14.740 --> 1:04:16.580\n created by, in the simulation.\n\n1:04:16.580 --> 1:04:20.300\n And then people, not people, creatures from outside\n\n1:04:20.300 --> 1:04:23.140\n of the simulation sort of can tune in\n\n1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:24.220\n and play your character.\n\n1:04:24.220 --> 1:04:27.220\n And that feeling you got is somebody just like,\n\n1:04:27.220 --> 1:04:29.300\n they got to play a poker tournament through you.\n\n1:04:29.300 --> 1:04:30.660\n Honestly, it felt like that.\n\n1:04:30.660 --> 1:04:33.100\n It did actually feel a little bit like that.\n\n1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:35.180\n But it's been 12 years now.\n\n1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:36.700\n I've retold the story many times.\n\n1:04:36.700 --> 1:04:38.940\n Like, I don't even know how much I can trust my memory.\n\n1:04:38.940 --> 1:04:41.500\n You're just an NPC retelling the same story.\n\n1:04:41.500 --> 1:04:43.780\n Because they just played the tournament and left.\n\n1:04:43.780 --> 1:04:44.780\n Yeah, they're like, oh, that was fun.\n\n1:04:44.780 --> 1:04:45.620\n Cool.\n\n1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:46.460\n Yeah, cool.\n\n1:04:46.460 --> 1:04:47.300\n Next time.\n\n1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:49.260\n And now you're for the rest of your life left\n\n1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:51.860\n as a boring NPC retelling this story of greatness.\n\n1:04:51.860 --> 1:04:53.700\n But it was, and what was interesting was that after that,\n\n1:04:53.700 --> 1:04:55.620\n then I didn't obviously win a major tournament\n\n1:04:55.620 --> 1:04:56.780\n for quite a long time.\n\n1:04:56.780 --> 1:05:01.180\n And it left, that was actually another sort of dark period\n\n1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:02.780\n because I had this incredible,\n\n1:05:02.780 --> 1:05:04.340\n like the highs of winning that,\n\n1:05:04.340 --> 1:05:06.180\n just on a like material level were insane,\n\n1:05:06.180 --> 1:05:07.060\n winning the money.\n\n1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:08.540\n I was on the front page of newspapers\n\n1:05:08.540 --> 1:05:10.220\n because there was like this girl that came out of nowhere\n\n1:05:10.220 --> 1:05:12.180\n and won this big thing.\n\n1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:14.820\n And so again, like sort of chasing that feeling\n\n1:05:14.820 --> 1:05:16.700\n was difficult.\n\n1:05:16.700 --> 1:05:18.140\n But then on top of that, there was this feeling\n\n1:05:18.140 --> 1:05:22.340\n of like almost being touched by something bigger\n\n1:05:22.340 --> 1:05:24.060\n that was like, ah.\n\n1:05:24.060 --> 1:05:26.580\n So maybe, did you have a sense\n\n1:05:26.580 --> 1:05:29.540\n that I might be somebody special?\n\n1:05:29.540 --> 1:05:31.860\n Like this kind of,\n\n1:05:34.340 --> 1:05:36.540\n I think that's the confidence thing\n\n1:05:36.540 --> 1:05:40.740\n that maybe you could do something special in this world\n\n1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:42.300\n after all kind of feeling.\n\n1:05:42.300 --> 1:05:45.340\n I definitely, I mean, this is the thing\n\n1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:48.220\n I think everybody wrestles with to an extent, right?\n\n1:05:48.220 --> 1:05:51.540\n We are truly the protagonists in our own lives.\n\n1:05:51.540 --> 1:05:54.620\n And so it's a natural bias, human bias\n\n1:05:54.620 --> 1:05:58.860\n to feel special.\n\n1:05:58.860 --> 1:06:00.820\n And I think, and in some ways we are special.\n\n1:06:00.820 --> 1:06:01.940\n Every single person is special\n\n1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:04.660\n because you are that, the universe does,\n\n1:06:04.660 --> 1:06:06.220\n the world literally does revolve around you.\n\n1:06:06.220 --> 1:06:08.580\n That's the thing in some respect.\n\n1:06:08.580 --> 1:06:10.540\n But of course, if you then zoom out\n\n1:06:10.540 --> 1:06:12.140\n and take the amalgam of everyone's experiences,\n\n1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:12.980\n then no, it doesn't.\n\n1:06:12.980 --> 1:06:15.700\n So there is this shared sort of objective reality,\n\n1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:17.740\n but sorry, there's objective reality that is shared,\n\n1:06:17.740 --> 1:06:19.260\n but then there's also this subjective reality\n\n1:06:19.260 --> 1:06:20.740\n which is truly unique to you.\n\n1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:22.300\n And I think both of those things coexist.\n\n1:06:22.300 --> 1:06:24.460\n And it's not like one is correct and one isn't.\n\n1:06:24.460 --> 1:06:26.300\n And again, anyone who's like,\n\n1:06:26.300 --> 1:06:28.180\n oh no, your lived experience is everything\n\n1:06:28.180 --> 1:06:30.100\n versus your lived experience is nothing.\n\n1:06:30.100 --> 1:06:32.500\n No, it's a blend between these two things.\n\n1:06:32.500 --> 1:06:33.860\n They can exist concurrently.\n\n1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:35.300\n But there's a certain kind of sense\n\n1:06:35.300 --> 1:06:36.780\n that at least I've had my whole life.\n\n1:06:36.780 --> 1:06:38.500\n And I think a lot of people have this as like,\n\n1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.980\n well, I'm just like this little person.\n\n1:06:40.980 --> 1:06:42.900\n Surely I can't be one of those people\n\n1:06:42.900 --> 1:06:46.540\n that do the big thing, right?\n\n1:06:46.540 --> 1:06:48.660\n There's all these big people doing big things.\n\n1:06:48.660 --> 1:06:53.420\n There's big actors and actresses, big musicians.\n\n1:06:53.420 --> 1:06:57.060\n There's big business owners and all that kind of stuff,\n\n1:06:57.060 --> 1:06:58.700\n scientists and so on.\n\n1:06:58.700 --> 1:07:02.420\n I have my own subject experience that I enjoy and so on,\n\n1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:04.860\n but there's like a different layer.\n\n1:07:04.860 --> 1:07:09.460\n Like surely I can't do those great things.\n\n1:07:09.460 --> 1:07:11.500\n I mean, one of the things just having interacted\n\n1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:14.140\n with a lot of great people, I realized,\n\n1:07:14.140 --> 1:07:19.140\n no, they're like just the same humans as me.\n\n1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:22.140\n And that realization I think is really empowering.\n\n1:07:22.140 --> 1:07:24.180\n And to remind yourself.\n\n1:07:24.180 --> 1:07:25.020\n What are they?\n\n1:07:25.020 --> 1:07:25.860\n Huh?\n\n1:07:25.860 --> 1:07:26.700\n What are they?\n\n1:07:26.700 --> 1:07:27.540\n Are they?\n\n1:07:27.540 --> 1:07:29.020\n Well, in terms of.\n\n1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:30.220\n Depends on some, yeah.\n\n1:07:30.220 --> 1:07:33.900\n They're like a bag of insecurities and.\n\n1:07:33.900 --> 1:07:34.740\n Yes.\n\n1:07:36.940 --> 1:07:41.300\n Peculiar sort of, like their own little weirdnesses\n\n1:07:41.300 --> 1:07:44.900\n and so on, I should say also not.\n\n1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:50.140\n They have the capacity for brilliance,\n\n1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:52.860\n but they're not generically brilliant.\n\n1:07:52.860 --> 1:07:55.740\n Like, you know, we tend to say this person\n\n1:07:55.740 --> 1:07:59.620\n or that person is brilliant, but really no,\n\n1:07:59.620 --> 1:08:02.740\n they're just like sitting there and thinking through stuff\n\n1:08:02.740 --> 1:08:04.780\n just like the rest of us.\n\n1:08:04.780 --> 1:08:05.620\n Right.\n\n1:08:05.620 --> 1:08:08.100\n I think they're in the habit of thinking through stuff\n\n1:08:08.100 --> 1:08:13.020\n seriously and they've built up a habit of not allowing them,\n\n1:08:13.020 --> 1:08:15.020\n their mind to get trapped in a bunch of bullshit\n\n1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:16.980\n and minutia of day to day life.\n\n1:08:16.980 --> 1:08:20.020\n They really think big ideas, but those big ideas,\n\n1:08:21.420 --> 1:08:24.700\n it's like allowing yourself the freedom to think big,\n\n1:08:24.700 --> 1:08:27.980\n to realize that you can be one that actually solved\n\n1:08:27.980 --> 1:08:29.260\n this particular big problem.\n\n1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:31.300\n First identify a big problem that you care about,\n\n1:08:31.300 --> 1:08:33.220\n then like, I can actually be the one\n\n1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:34.860\n that solves this problem.\n\n1:08:34.860 --> 1:08:37.260\n And like allowing yourself to believe that.\n\n1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:39.380\n And I think sometimes you do need to have like\n\n1:08:39.380 --> 1:08:41.700\n that shock go through your body and a voice tells you,\n\n1:08:41.700 --> 1:08:42.900\n you're gonna win this tournament.\n\n1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:43.740\n Well, exactly.\n\n1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:48.740\n And whether it was, it's this idea of useful fictions.\n\n1:08:50.500 --> 1:08:53.020\n So again, like going through all like\n\n1:08:53.020 --> 1:08:55.500\n the classic rationalist training of Les Wrong\n\n1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:57.460\n where it's like, you want your map,\n\n1:08:57.460 --> 1:09:00.100\n you know, the image you have of the world in your head\n\n1:09:00.100 --> 1:09:04.380\n to as accurately match up with how the world actually is.\n\n1:09:04.380 --> 1:09:06.900\n You want the map and the territory to perfectly align\n\n1:09:06.900 --> 1:09:08.380\n as, you know, you want it to be\n\n1:09:08.380 --> 1:09:10.980\n as an accurate representation as possible.\n\n1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:13.860\n I don't know if I fully subscribed to that anymore,\n\n1:09:13.860 --> 1:09:17.420\n having now had these moments of like feeling of something\n\n1:09:17.420 --> 1:09:20.340\n either bigger or just actually just being overconfident.\n\n1:09:20.340 --> 1:09:23.700\n Like there is value in overconfidence sometimes.\n\n1:09:23.700 --> 1:09:25.780\n If you, you know, take, you know,\n\n1:09:25.780 --> 1:09:30.540\n take Magnus Carlsen, right?\n\n1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:32.260\n If he, I'm sure from a young age,\n\n1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:34.380\n he knew he was very talented,\n\n1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:37.340\n but I wouldn't be surprised if he was also had something\n\n1:09:37.340 --> 1:09:40.260\n in him to, well, actually maybe he's a bad example\n\n1:09:40.260 --> 1:09:42.580\n because he truly is the world's greatest,\n\n1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:44.380\n but someone who it was unclear\n\n1:09:44.380 --> 1:09:45.620\n whether they were gonna be the world's greatest,\n\n1:09:45.620 --> 1:09:47.260\n but ended up doing extremely well\n\n1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:50.220\n because they had this innate, deep self confidence,\n\n1:09:50.220 --> 1:09:53.060\n this like even overblown idea\n\n1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:54.860\n of how good their relative skill level is.\n\n1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:56.900\n That gave them the confidence to then pursue this thing\n\n1:09:56.900 --> 1:10:00.380\n and they're like with the kind of focus and dedication\n\n1:10:00.380 --> 1:10:02.380\n that it requires to excel in whatever it is\n\n1:10:02.380 --> 1:10:03.420\n you're trying to do, you know?\n\n1:10:03.420 --> 1:10:06.060\n And so there are these useful fictions\n\n1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:09.540\n and that's where I think I diverge slightly\n\n1:10:09.540 --> 1:10:13.420\n with the classic sort of rationalist community\n\n1:10:14.620 --> 1:10:19.620\n because that's a field that is worth studying\n\n1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:23.220\n of like how the stories we tell,\n\n1:10:23.220 --> 1:10:25.020\n what the stories we tell to ourselves,\n\n1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:26.220\n even if they are actually false,\n\n1:10:26.220 --> 1:10:28.980\n and even if we suspect they might be false,\n\n1:10:28.980 --> 1:10:30.660\n how it's better to sort of have that like little bit\n\n1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:34.380\n of faith, like value in faith, I think actually.\n\n1:10:34.380 --> 1:10:35.860\n And that's partly another thing\n\n1:10:35.860 --> 1:10:40.620\n that's now led me to explore the concept of God,\n\n1:10:40.620 --> 1:10:42.940\n whether you wanna call it a simulator,\n\n1:10:42.940 --> 1:10:44.300\n the classic theological thing.\n\n1:10:44.300 --> 1:10:46.460\n I think we're all like elucidating to the same thing.\n\n1:10:46.460 --> 1:10:47.780\n Now, I don't know, I'm not saying,\n\n1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:49.180\n because obviously the Christian God\n\n1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:53.500\n is like all benevolent, endless love.\n\n1:10:53.500 --> 1:10:56.700\n The simulation, at least one of the simulation hypothesis\n\n1:10:56.700 --> 1:10:58.700\n is like, as you said, like a teenager in his bedroom\n\n1:10:58.700 --> 1:11:00.340\n who doesn't really care, doesn't give a shit\n\n1:11:00.340 --> 1:11:02.580\n about the individuals within there.\n\n1:11:02.580 --> 1:11:05.140\n It just like wants to see how the thing plays out\n\n1:11:05.140 --> 1:11:07.620\n because it's curious and it could turn it off like that.\n\n1:11:07.620 --> 1:11:09.900\n Where on the sort of psychopathy\n\n1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:13.820\n to benevolent spectrum God is, I don't know.\n\n1:11:13.820 --> 1:11:18.820\n But just having a little bit of faith\n\n1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:21.700\n that there is something else out there\n\n1:11:21.700 --> 1:11:24.340\n that might be interested in our outcome\n\n1:11:24.340 --> 1:11:27.940\n is I think an essential thing actually for people to find.\n\n1:11:27.940 --> 1:11:29.860\n A, because it creates commonality between,\n\n1:11:29.860 --> 1:11:31.860\n it's something we can all share.\n\n1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:35.020\n And it is uniquely humbling of all of us to an extent.\n\n1:11:35.020 --> 1:11:36.860\n It's like a common objective.\n\n1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:41.580\n But B, it gives people that little bit of like reserve\n\n1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:43.380\n when things get really dark.\n\n1:11:43.380 --> 1:11:44.860\n And I do think things are gonna get pretty dark\n\n1:11:44.860 --> 1:11:46.060\n over the next few years.\n\n1:11:47.180 --> 1:11:48.260\n But it gives that like,\n\n1:11:49.260 --> 1:11:50.780\n to think that there's something out there\n\n1:11:50.780 --> 1:11:53.140\n that actually wants our game to keep going.\n\n1:11:53.140 --> 1:11:55.020\n I keep calling it the game.\n\n1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:57.660\n It's a thing C and I, we call it the game.\n\n1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:02.660\n You and C is a.k.a. Grimes, we call what the game?\n\n1:12:02.660 --> 1:12:03.900\n Everything, the whole thing?\n\n1:12:03.900 --> 1:12:05.500\n Yeah, we joke about like.\n\n1:12:05.500 --> 1:12:06.820\n So everything is a game.\n\n1:12:06.820 --> 1:12:11.100\n Well, the universe, like what if it's a game\n\n1:12:11.100 --> 1:12:13.580\n and the goal of the game is to figure out like,\n\n1:12:13.580 --> 1:12:16.020\n well, either how to beat it, how to get out of it.\n\n1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:18.820\n Maybe this universe is an escape room,\n\n1:12:18.820 --> 1:12:20.140\n like a giant escape room.\n\n1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:22.900\n And the goal is to figure out,\n\n1:12:22.900 --> 1:12:25.820\n put all the pieces to puzzle, figure out how it works\n\n1:12:25.820 --> 1:12:29.780\n in order to like unlock this like hyperdimensional key\n\n1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:31.260\n and get out beyond what it is.\n\n1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:32.100\n That's.\n\n1:12:32.100 --> 1:12:34.380\n No, but then, so you're saying it's like different levels\n\n1:12:34.380 --> 1:12:36.500\n and it's like a cage within a cage within a cage\n\n1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:38.300\n and never like one cage at a time,\n\n1:12:38.300 --> 1:12:39.980\n you figure out how to escape that.\n\n1:12:41.060 --> 1:12:42.260\n Like a new level up, you know,\n\n1:12:42.260 --> 1:12:44.380\n like us becoming multi planetary would be a level up\n\n1:12:44.380 --> 1:12:46.700\n or us, you know, figuring out how to upload\n\n1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:48.260\n our consciousnesses to the thing.\n\n1:12:48.260 --> 1:12:51.380\n That would probably be a leveling up or spiritually,\n\n1:12:51.380 --> 1:12:53.580\n you know, humanity becoming more combined\n\n1:12:53.580 --> 1:12:56.900\n and less adversarial and bloodthirsty\n\n1:12:56.900 --> 1:12:58.780\n and us becoming a little bit more enlightened.\n\n1:12:58.780 --> 1:12:59.620\n That would be a leveling up.\n\n1:12:59.620 --> 1:13:01.860\n You know, there's many different frames to it,\n\n1:13:01.860 --> 1:13:05.140\n whether it's physical, you know, digital\n\n1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:05.980\n or like metaphysical.\n\n1:13:05.980 --> 1:13:07.380\n I wonder what the levels, I think,\n\n1:13:07.380 --> 1:13:10.900\n I think level one for earth is probably\n\n1:13:10.900 --> 1:13:14.060\n the biological evolutionary process.\n\n1:13:14.060 --> 1:13:18.380\n So going from single cell organisms to early humans.\n\n1:13:18.380 --> 1:13:22.980\n Then maybe level two is whatever's happening inside our minds\n\n1:13:22.980 --> 1:13:26.100\n and creating ideas and creating technologies.\n\n1:13:26.100 --> 1:13:30.220\n That's like evolutionary process of ideas.\n\n1:13:31.340 --> 1:13:34.620\n And then multi planetary is interesting.\n\n1:13:34.620 --> 1:13:35.940\n Is that fundamentally different\n\n1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:37.900\n from what we're doing here on earth?\n\n1:13:37.900 --> 1:13:41.780\n Probably, because it allows us to like exponentially scale.\n\n1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:46.380\n It delays the Malthusian trap, right?\n\n1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:50.380\n It's a way to keep the playing field,\n\n1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:53.380\n to make the playing field get larger\n\n1:13:53.380 --> 1:13:57.260\n so that it can accommodate more of our stuff, more of us.\n\n1:13:57.260 --> 1:13:58.460\n And that's a good thing,\n\n1:13:58.460 --> 1:14:03.460\n but I don't know if it like fully solves this issue of,\n\n1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:06.740\n well, this thing called Moloch,\n\n1:14:06.740 --> 1:14:07.820\n which we haven't talked about yet,\n\n1:14:07.820 --> 1:14:10.660\n but which is basically,\n\n1:14:10.660 --> 1:14:12.740\n I call it the God of unhealthy competition.\n\n1:14:12.740 --> 1:14:13.980\n Yeah, let's go to Moloch.\n\n1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:14.980\n What's Moloch?\n\n1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:18.380\n You did a great video on Moloch and one aspect of it,\n\n1:14:18.380 --> 1:14:20.420\n the application of it to one aspect.\n\n1:14:20.420 --> 1:14:22.420\n Instagram beauty filters.\n\n1:14:22.420 --> 1:14:23.580\n True.\n\n1:14:23.580 --> 1:14:27.340\n Very niche, but I wanted to start off small.\n\n1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:32.340\n So Moloch was originally coined as,\n\n1:14:34.540 --> 1:14:39.540\n well, so apparently back in the like Canaanite times,\n\n1:14:39.540 --> 1:14:41.420\n it was to say ancient Carthaginian,\n\n1:14:41.420 --> 1:14:43.220\n I can never say it Carthaginian,\n\n1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:47.620\n somewhere around like 300 BC or 280, I don't know.\n\n1:14:47.620 --> 1:14:49.700\n There was supposedly this death cult\n\n1:14:49.700 --> 1:14:53.220\n who would sacrifice their children\n\n1:14:53.220 --> 1:14:56.060\n to this awful demon God thing they called Moloch\n\n1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:59.380\n in order to get power to win wars.\n\n1:14:59.380 --> 1:15:00.900\n So really dark, horrible things.\n\n1:15:00.900 --> 1:15:02.580\n And it was literally like about child sacrifice,\n\n1:15:02.580 --> 1:15:04.060\n whether they actually existed or not, we don't know,\n\n1:15:04.060 --> 1:15:05.660\n but in mythology they did.\n\n1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:07.220\n And this God that they worshiped\n\n1:15:07.220 --> 1:15:09.220\n was this thing called Moloch.\n\n1:15:09.220 --> 1:15:10.940\n And then I don't know,\n\n1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.660\n it seemed like it was kind of quiet throughout history\n\n1:15:13.660 --> 1:15:15.420\n in terms of mythology beyond that,\n\n1:15:15.420 --> 1:15:20.420\n until this movie Metropolis in 1927 talked about this,\n\n1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:27.020\n you see that there was this incredible futuristic city\n\n1:15:27.020 --> 1:15:29.100\n that everyone was living great in,\n\n1:15:29.100 --> 1:15:31.380\n but then the protagonist goes underground into the sewers\n\n1:15:31.380 --> 1:15:34.260\n and sees that the city is run by this machine.\n\n1:15:34.260 --> 1:15:37.300\n And this machine basically would just like kill the workers\n\n1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:40.060\n all the time because it was just so hard to keep it running.\n\n1:15:40.060 --> 1:15:40.900\n They were always dying.\n\n1:15:40.900 --> 1:15:42.980\n So there was all this suffering that was required\n\n1:15:42.980 --> 1:15:44.540\n in order to keep the city going.\n\n1:15:44.540 --> 1:15:45.900\n And then the protagonist has this vision\n\n1:15:45.900 --> 1:15:48.140\n that this machine is actually this demon Moloch.\n\n1:15:48.140 --> 1:15:50.860\n So again, it's like this sort of like mechanistic consumption\n\n1:15:50.860 --> 1:15:53.820\n of humans in order to get more power.\n\n1:15:54.780 --> 1:15:58.700\n And then Allen Ginsberg wrote a poem in the 60s,\n\n1:15:58.700 --> 1:16:03.060\n which incredible poem called Howl about this thing Moloch.\n\n1:16:04.420 --> 1:16:06.980\n And a lot of people sort of quite understandably\n\n1:16:06.980 --> 1:16:08.740\n take the interpretation of that,\n\n1:16:08.740 --> 1:16:10.820\n that he's talking about capitalism.\n\n1:16:10.820 --> 1:16:13.740\n But then the sort of piece to resistance\n\n1:16:13.740 --> 1:16:16.340\n that's moved Moloch into this idea of game theory\n\n1:16:16.340 --> 1:16:19.140\n was Scott Alexander of Slate Style Codex\n\n1:16:20.540 --> 1:16:21.700\n wrote this incredible,\n\n1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:23.420\n well, literally I think it might be my favorite piece\n\n1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:24.260\n of writing of all time.\n\n1:16:24.260 --> 1:16:26.180\n It's called Meditations on Moloch.\n\n1:16:26.180 --> 1:16:27.540\n Everyone must go read it.\n\n1:16:28.820 --> 1:16:29.660\n And...\n\n1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:30.940\n I say Codex is a blog.\n\n1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:32.300\n It's a blog, yes.\n\n1:16:32.300 --> 1:16:35.220\n We can link to it in the show notes or something, right?\n\n1:16:35.220 --> 1:16:36.060\n No, don't.\n\n1:16:36.060 --> 1:16:38.340\n I, yes, yes.\n\n1:16:38.340 --> 1:16:41.260\n But I like how you assume\n\n1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:43.540\n I have a professional operation going on here.\n\n1:16:43.540 --> 1:16:44.380\n I mean...\n\n1:16:44.380 --> 1:16:45.220\n I shall try to remember to...\n\n1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:46.060\n You were gonna assume.\n\n1:16:46.060 --> 1:16:46.900\n What do you...\n\n1:16:46.900 --> 1:16:48.100\n What are you, what do you want?\n\n1:16:48.100 --> 1:16:49.420\n You're giving the impression of it.\n\n1:16:49.420 --> 1:16:50.700\n Yeah, I'll look, please.\n\n1:16:50.700 --> 1:16:53.260\n If I don't, please somebody in the comments remind me.\n\n1:16:53.260 --> 1:16:54.100\n I'll help you.\n\n1:16:54.100 --> 1:16:55.780\n If you don't know this blog,\n\n1:16:55.780 --> 1:16:59.420\n it's one of the best blogs ever probably.\n\n1:16:59.420 --> 1:17:01.180\n You should probably be following it.\n\n1:17:01.180 --> 1:17:02.020\n Yes.\n\n1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:03.340\n Are blogs still a thing?\n\n1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:04.660\n I think they are still a thing, yeah.\n\n1:17:04.660 --> 1:17:06.220\n Yeah, he's migrated onto Substack,\n\n1:17:06.220 --> 1:17:07.860\n but yeah, it's still a blog.\n\n1:17:07.860 --> 1:17:08.700\n Anyway.\n\n1:17:08.700 --> 1:17:10.860\n Substack better not fuck things up, but...\n\n1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:12.100\n I hope not, yeah.\n\n1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:14.620\n I hope they don't, I hope they don't turn Molochy,\n\n1:17:14.620 --> 1:17:16.700\n which will mean something to people when we continue.\n\n1:17:16.700 --> 1:17:17.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:17:17.540 --> 1:17:19.460\n When I stop interrupting for once.\n\n1:17:19.460 --> 1:17:20.300\n No, no, it's good.\n\n1:17:20.300 --> 1:17:21.140\n Go on, yeah.\n\n1:17:21.140 --> 1:17:22.220\n So anyway, so he writes,\n\n1:17:22.220 --> 1:17:24.940\n he writes this piece, Meditations on Moloch,\n\n1:17:24.940 --> 1:17:28.220\n and basically he analyzes the poem and he's like,\n\n1:17:28.220 --> 1:17:29.700\n okay, so it seems to be something relating\n\n1:17:29.700 --> 1:17:32.460\n to where competition goes wrong.\n\n1:17:32.460 --> 1:17:35.580\n And, you know, Moloch was historically this thing\n\n1:17:35.580 --> 1:17:38.820\n of like where people would sacrifice a thing\n\n1:17:38.820 --> 1:17:40.460\n that they care about, in this case, children,\n\n1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:43.220\n their own children, in order to gain power,\n\n1:17:43.220 --> 1:17:45.340\n a competitive advantage.\n\n1:17:45.340 --> 1:17:48.860\n And if you look at almost everything that sort of goes wrong\n\n1:17:48.860 --> 1:17:52.300\n in our society, it's that same process.\n\n1:17:52.300 --> 1:17:55.020\n So with the Instagram beauty filters thing,\n\n1:17:56.420 --> 1:17:57.900\n you know, if you're trying to become\n\n1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:01.940\n a famous Instagram model,\n\n1:18:01.940 --> 1:18:03.820\n you are incentivized to post the hottest pictures\n\n1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:05.620\n of yourself that you can, you know,\n\n1:18:05.620 --> 1:18:07.220\n you're trying to play that game.\n\n1:18:07.220 --> 1:18:08.660\n There's a lot of hot women on Instagram.\n\n1:18:08.660 --> 1:18:10.020\n How do you compete against them?\n\n1:18:10.020 --> 1:18:11.540\n You post really hot pictures\n\n1:18:11.540 --> 1:18:13.180\n and that's how you get more likes.\n\n1:18:14.220 --> 1:18:16.780\n As technology gets better, you know,\n\n1:18:16.780 --> 1:18:19.260\n more makeup techniques come along.\n\n1:18:19.260 --> 1:18:22.020\n And then more recently, these beauty filters\n\n1:18:22.020 --> 1:18:23.420\n where like at the touch of a button,\n\n1:18:23.420 --> 1:18:26.060\n it makes your face look absolutely incredible\n\n1:18:26.060 --> 1:18:28.660\n compared to your natural face.\n\n1:18:29.540 --> 1:18:30.940\n These technologies come along,\n\n1:18:30.940 --> 1:18:34.580\n it's everyone is incentivized to that short term strategy.\n\n1:18:35.620 --> 1:18:39.020\n But over on net, it's bad for everyone\n\n1:18:39.020 --> 1:18:40.460\n because now everyone is kind of feeling\n\n1:18:40.460 --> 1:18:41.660\n like they have to use these things.\n\n1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:43.060\n And these things like they make you like,\n\n1:18:43.060 --> 1:18:44.380\n the reason why I talked about them in this video\n\n1:18:44.380 --> 1:18:45.860\n is because I noticed it myself, you know,\n\n1:18:45.860 --> 1:18:48.820\n like I was trying to grow my Instagram for a while,\n\n1:18:48.820 --> 1:18:49.660\n I've given up on it now.\n\n1:18:49.660 --> 1:18:52.500\n But yeah, and I noticed these filters,\n\n1:18:52.500 --> 1:18:53.420\n how good they made me look.\n\n1:18:53.420 --> 1:18:56.380\n And I'm like, well, I know that everyone else\n\n1:18:56.380 --> 1:18:57.220\n is kind of doing it.\n\n1:18:57.220 --> 1:18:58.980\n Go subscribe to Liv's Instagram.\n\n1:18:58.980 --> 1:19:01.180\n Please, so I don't have to use the filters.\n\n1:19:01.180 --> 1:19:05.020\n I'll post a bunch of, yeah, make it blow up.\n\n1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:08.460\n So yeah, you felt the pressure actually.\n\n1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:10.980\n Exactly, these short term incentives\n\n1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:13.980\n to do this like, this thing that like either sacrifices\n\n1:19:13.980 --> 1:19:17.300\n your integrity or something else\n\n1:19:17.300 --> 1:19:19.140\n in order to like stay competitive,\n\n1:19:20.100 --> 1:19:22.700\n which on aggregate turns like,\n\n1:19:22.700 --> 1:19:24.820\n creates this like sort of race to the bottom spiral\n\n1:19:24.820 --> 1:19:26.580\n where everyone else ends up in a situation\n\n1:19:26.580 --> 1:19:28.220\n which is worse off than if they hadn't started,\n\n1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:29.300\n you know, than they were before.\n\n1:19:29.300 --> 1:19:33.300\n Kind of like if, like at a football stadium,\n\n1:19:34.300 --> 1:19:36.380\n like the system is so badly designed,\n\n1:19:36.380 --> 1:19:38.140\n a competitive system of like everyone sitting\n\n1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:40.220\n and having a view that if someone at the very front\n\n1:19:40.220 --> 1:19:42.060\n stands up to get an even better view,\n\n1:19:42.060 --> 1:19:43.620\n it forces everyone else behind\n\n1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:45.420\n to like adopt that same strategy\n\n1:19:45.420 --> 1:19:46.980\n just to get to where they were before.\n\n1:19:46.980 --> 1:19:48.700\n But now everyone's stuck standing up.\n\n1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:51.860\n Like, so you need this like top down God's eye coordination\n\n1:19:51.860 --> 1:19:53.820\n to make it go back to the better state.\n\n1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:56.100\n But from within the system, you can't actually do that.\n\n1:19:56.100 --> 1:19:57.660\n So that's kind of what this Moloch thing is.\n\n1:19:57.660 --> 1:20:01.580\n It's this thing that makes people sacrifice values\n\n1:20:01.580 --> 1:20:04.620\n in order to optimize for the winning the game in question,\n\n1:20:04.620 --> 1:20:05.500\n the short term game.\n\n1:20:05.500 --> 1:20:09.740\n But this Moloch, can you attribute it\n\n1:20:09.740 --> 1:20:11.700\n to any one centralized source\n\n1:20:11.700 --> 1:20:13.620\n or is it an emergent phenomena\n\n1:20:13.620 --> 1:20:16.140\n from a large collection of people?\n\n1:20:16.140 --> 1:20:16.980\n Exactly that.\n\n1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:18.860\n It's an emergent phenomena.\n\n1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:21.300\n It's a force of game theory.\n\n1:20:22.220 --> 1:20:25.580\n It's a force of bad incentives on a multi agent system\n\n1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:26.580\n where you've got more, you know,\n\n1:20:26.580 --> 1:20:28.140\n prisoner's dilemma is technically\n\n1:20:28.140 --> 1:20:30.500\n a kind of Moloch system as well,\n\n1:20:30.500 --> 1:20:31.980\n but it's just a two player thing.\n\n1:20:31.980 --> 1:20:35.740\n But another word for Moloch is it multipolar trap.\n\n1:20:35.740 --> 1:20:37.780\n Where basically you just got a lot of different people\n\n1:20:37.780 --> 1:20:40.740\n all competing for some kind of prize.\n\n1:20:40.740 --> 1:20:42.380\n And it would be better\n\n1:20:42.380 --> 1:20:44.740\n if everyone didn't do this one shitty strategy,\n\n1:20:44.740 --> 1:20:47.260\n but because that strategy gives you a short term advantage,\n\n1:20:47.260 --> 1:20:48.500\n everyone's incentivized to do it.\n\n1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:49.860\n And so everyone ends up doing it.\n\n1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:51.980\n So the responsibility for,\n\n1:20:51.980 --> 1:20:54.060\n I mean, social media is a really nice place\n\n1:20:54.060 --> 1:20:56.860\n for a large number of people to play game theory.\n\n1:20:56.860 --> 1:20:59.740\n And so they also have the ability\n\n1:20:59.740 --> 1:21:02.580\n to then design the rules of the game.\n\n1:21:02.580 --> 1:21:05.540\n And is it on them to try to anticipate\n\n1:21:05.540 --> 1:21:07.900\n what kind of like to do the thing\n\n1:21:07.900 --> 1:21:11.100\n that poker players are doing to run simulation?\n\n1:21:11.100 --> 1:21:12.380\n Ideally that would have been great.\n\n1:21:12.380 --> 1:21:15.580\n If, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and Jack\n\n1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:17.260\n and all the, you know, the Twitter founders and everyone,\n\n1:21:17.260 --> 1:21:20.580\n if they had at least just run a few simulations\n\n1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:23.220\n of how their algorithms would, you know,\n\n1:21:23.220 --> 1:21:26.260\n if different types of algorithms would turn out for society,\n\n1:21:26.260 --> 1:21:27.340\n that would have been great.\n\n1:21:27.340 --> 1:21:28.700\n That's really difficult to do\n\n1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:30.420\n that kind of deep philosophical thinking\n\n1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:33.100\n about thinking about humanity actually.\n\n1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:38.100\n So not kind of this level of how do we optimize engagement\n\n1:21:40.580 --> 1:21:42.860\n or what brings people joy in the short term,\n\n1:21:42.860 --> 1:21:45.300\n but how is this thing going to change\n\n1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:47.940\n the way people see the world?\n\n1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:52.940\n How is it gonna get morphed in iterative games played\n\n1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:56.860\n into something that will change society forever?\n\n1:21:56.860 --> 1:21:58.500\n That requires some deep thinking.\n\n1:21:58.500 --> 1:22:02.420\n That's, I hope there's meetings like that inside companies,\n\n1:22:02.420 --> 1:22:03.260\n but I haven't seen them.\n\n1:22:03.260 --> 1:22:04.300\n There aren't, that's the problem.\n\n1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:07.500\n And it's difficult because like,\n\n1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:09.740\n when you're starting up a social media company,\n\n1:22:09.740 --> 1:22:13.940\n you know, you're aware that you've got investors to please,\n\n1:22:13.940 --> 1:22:17.100\n there's bills to pay, you know,\n\n1:22:17.100 --> 1:22:19.940\n there's only so much R&D you can afford to do.\n\n1:22:19.940 --> 1:22:21.940\n You've got all these like incredible pressures,\n\n1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:24.420\n bad incentives to get on and just build your thing\n\n1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:26.620\n as quickly as possible and start making money.\n\n1:22:26.620 --> 1:22:29.100\n And, you know, I don't think anyone intended\n\n1:22:29.100 --> 1:22:32.580\n when they built these social media platforms\n\n1:22:32.580 --> 1:22:33.860\n and just to like preface it.\n\n1:22:33.860 --> 1:22:36.340\n So the reason why, you know, social media is relevant\n\n1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:38.740\n because it's a very good example of like,\n\n1:22:38.740 --> 1:22:42.020\n everyone these days is optimizing for, you know, clicks,\n\n1:22:42.980 --> 1:22:44.780\n whether it's a social media platforms themselves,\n\n1:22:44.780 --> 1:22:47.300\n because, you know, every click gets more, you know,\n\n1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:49.740\n impressions and impressions pay for, you know,\n\n1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:50.980\n they get advertising dollars\n\n1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.740\n or whether it's individual influencers\n\n1:22:53.740 --> 1:22:56.100\n or, you know, whether it's a New York Times or whoever,\n\n1:22:56.100 --> 1:22:58.300\n they're trying to get their story to go viral.\n\n1:22:58.300 --> 1:23:00.220\n So everyone's got this bad incentive of using, you know,\n\n1:23:00.220 --> 1:23:02.780\n as you called it, the clickbait industrial complex.\n\n1:23:02.780 --> 1:23:04.220\n That's a very molly key system\n\n1:23:04.220 --> 1:23:06.260\n because everyone is now using worse and worse tactics\n\n1:23:06.260 --> 1:23:09.500\n in order to like try and win this attention game.\n\n1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:14.500\n And yeah, so ideally these companies\n\n1:23:14.620 --> 1:23:17.300\n would have had enough slack in the beginning\n\n1:23:17.300 --> 1:23:19.780\n in order to run these experiments to see,\n\n1:23:19.780 --> 1:23:22.460\n okay, what are the ways this could possibly go wrong\n\n1:23:22.460 --> 1:23:23.300\n for people?\n\n1:23:23.300 --> 1:23:24.700\n What are the ways that Moloch,\n\n1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:26.300\n they should be aware of this concept of Moloch\n\n1:23:26.300 --> 1:23:28.300\n and realize that whenever you have\n\n1:23:28.300 --> 1:23:31.300\n a highly competitive multiagent system,\n\n1:23:31.300 --> 1:23:32.900\n which social media is a classic example of,\n\n1:23:32.900 --> 1:23:34.900\n millions of agents all trying to compete\n\n1:23:34.900 --> 1:23:35.940\n for likes and so on,\n\n1:23:35.940 --> 1:23:39.940\n and you try and bring all this complexity down\n\n1:23:39.940 --> 1:23:41.900\n into like very small metrics,\n\n1:23:41.900 --> 1:23:44.860\n such as number of likes, number of retweets,\n\n1:23:44.860 --> 1:23:46.700\n whatever the algorithm optimizes for,\n\n1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:49.780\n that is a guaranteed recipe for this stuff to go wrong\n\n1:23:49.780 --> 1:23:51.540\n and become a race to the bottom.\n\n1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:53.900\n I think there should be an honesty when founders,\n\n1:23:53.900 --> 1:23:56.380\n I think there's a hunger for that kind of transparency\n\n1:23:56.380 --> 1:23:58.180\n of like, we don't know what the fuck we're doing.\n\n1:23:58.180 --> 1:23:59.700\n This is a fascinating experiment.\n\n1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:02.780\n We're all running as a human civilization.\n\n1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:04.260\n Let's try this out.\n\n1:24:04.260 --> 1:24:06.380\n And like, actually just be honest about this,\n\n1:24:06.380 --> 1:24:10.420\n that we're all like these weird rats in a maze.\n\n1:24:10.420 --> 1:24:12.380\n None of us are controlling it.\n\n1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:15.100\n There's this kind of sense like the founders,\n\n1:24:15.100 --> 1:24:17.540\n the CEO of Instagram or whatever,\n\n1:24:17.540 --> 1:24:19.980\n Mark Zuckerberg has a control and he's like,\n\n1:24:19.980 --> 1:24:21.820\n like with strings playing people.\n\n1:24:21.820 --> 1:24:22.860\n No, they're.\n\n1:24:22.860 --> 1:24:24.580\n He's at the mercy of this is like everyone else.\n\n1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:26.540\n He's just like trying to do his best.\n\n1:24:26.540 --> 1:24:29.260\n And like, I think putting on a smile\n\n1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:32.980\n and doing over polished videos\n\n1:24:32.980 --> 1:24:36.860\n about how Instagram and Facebook are good for you,\n\n1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:39.980\n I think is not the right way to actually ask\n\n1:24:39.980 --> 1:24:43.180\n some of the deepest questions we get to ask as a society.\n\n1:24:43.180 --> 1:24:48.100\n How do we design the game such that we build a better world?\n\n1:24:48.100 --> 1:24:51.700\n I think a big part of this as well is people,\n\n1:24:51.700 --> 1:24:55.700\n there's this philosophy, particularly in Silicon Valley\n\n1:24:56.980 --> 1:24:58.500\n of well, techno optimism,\n\n1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.340\n technology will solve all our issues.\n\n1:25:01.300 --> 1:25:03.700\n And there's a steel man argument to that where yes,\n\n1:25:03.700 --> 1:25:05.380\n technology has solved a lot of problems\n\n1:25:05.380 --> 1:25:08.140\n and can potentially solve a lot of future ones.\n\n1:25:08.140 --> 1:25:10.820\n But it can also, it's always a double edged sword.\n\n1:25:10.820 --> 1:25:11.900\n And particularly as you know,\n\n1:25:11.900 --> 1:25:13.420\n technology gets more and more powerful\n\n1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:15.060\n and we've now got like big data\n\n1:25:15.060 --> 1:25:17.300\n and we're able to do all kinds of like\n\n1:25:17.300 --> 1:25:19.500\n psychological manipulation with it and so on.\n\n1:25:22.740 --> 1:25:24.940\n Technology is not a values neutral thing.\n\n1:25:24.940 --> 1:25:26.980\n People think, I used to always think this myself.\n\n1:25:26.980 --> 1:25:28.900\n It's like this naive view that,\n\n1:25:28.900 --> 1:25:30.700\n oh, technology is completely neutral.\n\n1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:33.820\n It's just, it's the humans that either make it good or bad.\n\n1:25:33.820 --> 1:25:36.620\n No, to the point we're at now,\n\n1:25:36.620 --> 1:25:38.020\n the technology that we are creating,\n\n1:25:38.020 --> 1:25:39.420\n they are social technologies.\n\n1:25:39.420 --> 1:25:44.420\n They literally dictate how humans now form social groups\n\n1:25:45.420 --> 1:25:46.260\n and so on beyond that.\n\n1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:47.780\n And beyond that, it also then,\n\n1:25:47.780 --> 1:25:49.580\n that gives rise to like the memes\n\n1:25:49.580 --> 1:25:51.980\n that we then like coalesce around.\n\n1:25:51.980 --> 1:25:54.380\n And that, if you have the stack that way\n\n1:25:54.380 --> 1:25:56.940\n where it's technology driving social interaction,\n\n1:25:56.940 --> 1:26:00.460\n which then drives like memetic culture\n\n1:26:00.460 --> 1:26:04.780\n and like which ideas become popular, that's Moloch.\n\n1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:06.820\n And we need the other way around, we need it.\n\n1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.420\n So we need to figure out what are the good memes?\n\n1:26:08.420 --> 1:26:11.820\n What are the good values\n\n1:26:11.820 --> 1:26:15.060\n that we think we need to optimize for\n\n1:26:15.060 --> 1:26:17.180\n that like makes people happy and healthy\n\n1:26:17.180 --> 1:26:21.340\n and like keeps society as robust and safe as possible,\n\n1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:22.820\n then figure out what the social structure\n\n1:26:22.820 --> 1:26:23.660\n around those should be.\n\n1:26:23.660 --> 1:26:25.460\n And only then do we figure out technology,\n\n1:26:25.460 --> 1:26:26.780\n but we're doing the other way around.\n\n1:26:26.780 --> 1:26:31.780\n And as much as I love in many ways\n\n1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:32.940\n the culture of Silicon Valley,\n\n1:26:32.940 --> 1:26:36.020\n and like I do think that technology has,\n\n1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:36.860\n I don't wanna knock it.\n\n1:26:36.860 --> 1:26:38.180\n It's done so many wonderful things for us,\n\n1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:39.220\n same as capitalism.\n\n1:26:40.340 --> 1:26:44.100\n There are, we have to like be honest with ourselves.\n\n1:26:44.100 --> 1:26:47.220\n We're getting to a point where we are losing control\n\n1:26:47.220 --> 1:26:49.580\n of this very powerful machine that we have created.\n\n1:26:49.580 --> 1:26:53.220\n Can you redesign the machine within the game?\n\n1:26:53.220 --> 1:26:57.380\n Can you just have, can you understand the game enough?\n\n1:26:57.380 --> 1:26:58.860\n Okay, this is the game.\n\n1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:01.900\n And this is how we start to reemphasize\n\n1:27:01.900 --> 1:27:03.860\n the memes that matter,\n\n1:27:03.860 --> 1:27:06.740\n the memes that bring out the best in us.\n\n1:27:06.740 --> 1:27:11.340\n You know, like the way I try to be in real life\n\n1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:13.260\n and the way I try to be online\n\n1:27:13.260 --> 1:27:15.900\n is to be about kindness and love.\n\n1:27:15.900 --> 1:27:19.860\n And I feel like I'm sometimes get like criticized\n\n1:27:19.860 --> 1:27:22.040\n for being naive and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:25.840\n But I feel like I'm just trying to live within this game.\n\n1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:27.520\n I'm trying to be authentic.\n\n1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.080\n Yeah, but also like, hey, it's kind of fun to do this.\n\n1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:33.900\n Like you guys should try this too, you know,\n\n1:27:33.900 --> 1:27:37.180\n and that's like trying to redesign\n\n1:27:37.180 --> 1:27:40.020\n some aspects of the game within the game.\n\n1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:41.920\n Is that possible?\n\n1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.740\n I don't know, but I think we should try.\n\n1:27:46.740 --> 1:27:48.620\n I don't think we have an option but to try.\n\n1:27:48.620 --> 1:27:51.140\n Well, the other option is to create new companies\n\n1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:55.300\n or to pressure companies that,\n\n1:27:55.300 --> 1:27:59.060\n or anyone who has control of the rules of the game.\n\n1:27:59.060 --> 1:28:01.100\n I think we need to be doing all of the above.\n\n1:28:01.100 --> 1:28:02.980\n I think we need to be thinking hard\n\n1:28:02.980 --> 1:28:06.040\n about what are the kind of positive, healthy memes.\n\n1:28:09.140 --> 1:28:10.900\n You know, as Elon said,\n\n1:28:10.900 --> 1:28:13.620\n he who controls the memes controls the universe.\n\n1:28:13.620 --> 1:28:14.460\n He said that.\n\n1:28:14.460 --> 1:28:16.300\n I think he did, yeah.\n\n1:28:16.300 --> 1:28:17.860\n But there's truth to that.\n\n1:28:17.860 --> 1:28:19.380\n It's very, there is wisdom in that\n\n1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:22.700\n because memes have driven history.\n\n1:28:22.700 --> 1:28:24.900\n You know, we are a cultural species.\n\n1:28:24.900 --> 1:28:27.140\n That's what sets us apart from chimpanzees\n\n1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:27.980\n and everything else.\n\n1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:32.500\n We have the ability to learn and evolve through culture\n\n1:28:32.500 --> 1:28:34.900\n as opposed to biology or like, you know,\n\n1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:37.300\n classic physical constraints.\n\n1:28:37.300 --> 1:28:40.740\n And that means culture is incredibly powerful\n\n1:28:40.740 --> 1:28:43.820\n and we can create and become victim\n\n1:28:43.820 --> 1:28:46.620\n to very bad memes or very good ones.\n\n1:28:46.620 --> 1:28:49.300\n But we do have some agency over which memes,\n\n1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:51.940\n you know, we, but not only put out there,\n\n1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:53.620\n but we also like subscribe to.\n\n1:28:54.540 --> 1:28:56.460\n So I think we need to take that approach.\n\n1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:58.980\n We also need to, you know,\n\n1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:02.740\n because I don't want, I'm making this video right now\n\n1:29:02.740 --> 1:29:03.740\n called The Attention Wars,\n\n1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:05.460\n which is about like how Moloch,\n\n1:29:05.460 --> 1:29:08.500\n like the media machine is this Moloch machine.\n\n1:29:08.500 --> 1:29:11.580\n Well, is this kind of like blind dumb thing\n\n1:29:11.580 --> 1:29:13.140\n where everyone is optimizing for engagement\n\n1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:16.420\n in order to win their share of the attention pie.\n\n1:29:16.420 --> 1:29:17.300\n And then if you zoom out,\n\n1:29:17.300 --> 1:29:19.180\n it's really like Moloch that's pulling the strings\n\n1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:20.860\n because the only thing that benefits from this in the end,\n\n1:29:20.860 --> 1:29:23.980\n you know, like our information ecosystem is breaking down.\n\n1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:26.420\n Like we have, you look at the state of the US,\n\n1:29:26.420 --> 1:29:28.340\n it's in, we're in a civil war.\n\n1:29:28.340 --> 1:29:29.900\n It's just not a physical war.\n\n1:29:29.900 --> 1:29:33.220\n It's an information war.\n\n1:29:33.220 --> 1:29:35.020\n And people are becoming more fractured\n\n1:29:35.020 --> 1:29:37.380\n in terms of what their actual shared reality is.\n\n1:29:37.380 --> 1:29:39.500\n Like truly like an extreme left person,\n\n1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.420\n an extreme right person,\n\n1:29:40.420 --> 1:29:43.380\n like they literally live in different worlds\n\n1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:45.220\n in their minds at this point.\n\n1:29:45.220 --> 1:29:47.180\n And it's getting more and more amplified.\n\n1:29:47.180 --> 1:29:50.260\n And this force is like a razor blade\n\n1:29:50.260 --> 1:29:51.860\n pushing through everything.\n\n1:29:51.860 --> 1:29:53.340\n It doesn't matter how innocuous a topic is,\n\n1:29:53.340 --> 1:29:55.220\n it will find a way to split into this,\n\n1:29:55.220 --> 1:29:58.260\n you know, bifurcated cultural and it's fucking terrifying.\n\n1:29:58.260 --> 1:29:59.780\n Because that maximizes the tension.\n\n1:29:59.780 --> 1:30:03.140\n And that's like an emergent Moloch type force\n\n1:30:03.140 --> 1:30:06.820\n that takes anything, any topic\n\n1:30:06.820 --> 1:30:11.140\n and cuts through it so that it can split nicely\n\n1:30:11.140 --> 1:30:12.500\n into two groups.\n\n1:30:12.500 --> 1:30:13.820\n One that's...\n\n1:30:13.820 --> 1:30:16.380\n Well, it's whatever, yeah,\n\n1:30:16.380 --> 1:30:17.980\n all everyone is trying to do within the system\n\n1:30:17.980 --> 1:30:21.180\n is just maximize whatever gets them the most attention\n\n1:30:21.180 --> 1:30:22.300\n because they're just trying to make money\n\n1:30:22.300 --> 1:30:24.460\n so they can keep their thing going, right?\n\n1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:29.140\n And the best emotion for getting attention,\n\n1:30:29.140 --> 1:30:30.820\n well, because it's not just about attention on the internet,\n\n1:30:30.820 --> 1:30:33.020\n it's engagement, that's the key thing, right?\n\n1:30:33.020 --> 1:30:34.380\n In order for something to go viral,\n\n1:30:34.380 --> 1:30:35.940\n you need people to actually engage with it.\n\n1:30:35.940 --> 1:30:38.580\n They need to like comment or retweet or whatever.\n\n1:30:39.740 --> 1:30:42.500\n And of all the emotions that,\n\n1:30:43.540 --> 1:30:45.780\n there's like seven classic shared emotions\n\n1:30:45.780 --> 1:30:47.500\n that studies have found that all humans,\n\n1:30:47.500 --> 1:30:51.020\n even from like previously uncontacted tribes have.\n\n1:30:51.020 --> 1:30:54.620\n Some of those are negative, you know, like sadness,\n\n1:30:54.620 --> 1:30:57.580\n disgust, anger, et cetera, some are positive,\n\n1:30:57.580 --> 1:31:01.140\n happiness, excitement, and so on.\n\n1:31:01.140 --> 1:31:03.540\n The one that happens to be the most useful\n\n1:31:03.540 --> 1:31:05.540\n for the internet is anger.\n\n1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:09.780\n Because anger, it's such an active emotion.\n\n1:31:09.780 --> 1:31:13.060\n If you want people to engage, if someone's scared,\n\n1:31:13.060 --> 1:31:14.700\n and I'm not just like talking out my ass here,\n\n1:31:14.700 --> 1:31:16.540\n there are studies here that have looked into this.\n\n1:31:18.540 --> 1:31:19.580\n Whereas like if someone's like,\n\n1:31:19.580 --> 1:31:22.420\n disgusted or fearful, they actually tend to then be like,\n\n1:31:22.420 --> 1:31:23.500\n oh, I don't wanna deal with this.\n\n1:31:23.500 --> 1:31:25.100\n So they're less likely to actually engage\n\n1:31:25.100 --> 1:31:27.180\n and share it and so on, they're just gonna be like, ugh.\n\n1:31:27.180 --> 1:31:29.700\n Whereas if they're enraged by a thing,\n\n1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:31.980\n well now that triggers all the like,\n\n1:31:31.980 --> 1:31:34.820\n the old tribalism emotions.\n\n1:31:34.820 --> 1:31:37.260\n And so that's how then things get sort of spread,\n\n1:31:37.260 --> 1:31:38.100\n you know, much more easily.\n\n1:31:38.100 --> 1:31:42.180\n They out compete all the other memes in the ecosystem.\n\n1:31:42.180 --> 1:31:46.180\n And so this like, the attention economy,\n\n1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:48.340\n the wheels that make it go around are,\n\n1:31:48.340 --> 1:31:49.740\n is rage.\n\n1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:53.860\n I did a tweet, the problem with raging against the machine\n\n1:31:53.860 --> 1:31:56.020\n is that the machine has learned to feed off rage.\n\n1:31:56.020 --> 1:31:57.860\n Because it is feeding off our rage.\n\n1:31:57.860 --> 1:31:59.180\n That's the thing that's now keeping it going.\n\n1:31:59.180 --> 1:32:01.900\n So the more we get angry, the worse it gets.\n\n1:32:01.900 --> 1:32:04.700\n So the mullet in this attention,\n\n1:32:04.700 --> 1:32:09.700\n in the war of attention is constantly maximizing rage.\n\n1:32:10.260 --> 1:32:12.420\n What it is optimizing for is engagement.\n\n1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:14.300\n And it happens to be that engagement\n\n1:32:14.300 --> 1:32:19.300\n is more propaganda, you know.\n\n1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:23.220\n I mean, it just sounds like everything is putting,\n\n1:32:23.220 --> 1:32:24.500\n more and more things are being put through this\n\n1:32:24.500 --> 1:32:27.020\n like propagandist lens of winning\n\n1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:28.900\n whatever the war is in question.\n\n1:32:28.900 --> 1:32:31.420\n Whether it's the culture war or the Ukraine war, yeah.\n\n1:32:31.420 --> 1:32:33.260\n Well, I think the silver lining of this,\n\n1:32:33.260 --> 1:32:36.540\n do you think it's possible that in the long arc\n\n1:32:36.540 --> 1:32:39.580\n of this process, you actually do arrive\n\n1:32:39.580 --> 1:32:41.820\n at greater wisdom and more progress?\n\n1:32:41.820 --> 1:32:45.100\n It just, in the moment, it feels like people are\n\n1:32:45.100 --> 1:32:47.780\n tearing each other to shreds over ideas.\n\n1:32:47.780 --> 1:32:49.580\n But if you think about it, one of the magic things\n\n1:32:49.580 --> 1:32:51.740\n about democracy and so on, is you have\n\n1:32:51.740 --> 1:32:53.900\n the blue versus red constantly fighting.\n\n1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:58.180\n It's almost like they're in discourse,\n\n1:32:58.180 --> 1:33:01.300\n creating devil's advocate, making devils out of each other.\n\n1:33:01.300 --> 1:33:04.900\n And through that process, discussing ideas.\n\n1:33:04.900 --> 1:33:07.740\n Like almost really embodying different ideas\n\n1:33:07.740 --> 1:33:08.860\n just to yell at each other.\n\n1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:11.660\n And through the yelling, over the period of decades,\n\n1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:15.380\n maybe centuries, figuring out a better system.\n\n1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.580\n Like in the moment, it feels fucked up.\n\n1:33:17.580 --> 1:33:20.820\n But in the long arc, it actually is productive.\n\n1:33:20.820 --> 1:33:21.660\n I hope so.\n\n1:33:23.340 --> 1:33:28.340\n That said, we are now in the era of,\n\n1:33:28.460 --> 1:33:30.540\n just as we have weapons of mass destruction\n\n1:33:30.540 --> 1:33:32.420\n with nuclear weapons, you know,\n\n1:33:32.420 --> 1:33:35.260\n that can break the whole playing field,\n\n1:33:35.260 --> 1:33:37.700\n we now are developing weapons\n\n1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:39.420\n of informational mass destruction.\n\n1:33:39.420 --> 1:33:41.940\n Information weapons, you know, WMDs\n\n1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:44.860\n that basically can be used for propaganda\n\n1:33:44.860 --> 1:33:49.540\n or just manipulating people however is needed,\n\n1:33:49.540 --> 1:33:53.100\n whether that's through dumb TikTok videos,\n\n1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:58.100\n or, you know, there are significant resources being put in.\n\n1:33:59.100 --> 1:34:01.500\n I don't mean to sound like, you know,\n\n1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:04.300\n to doom and gloom, but there are bad actors out there.\n\n1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:06.020\n That's the thing, there are plenty of good actors\n\n1:34:06.020 --> 1:34:07.780\n within the system who are just trying to stay afloat\n\n1:34:07.780 --> 1:34:09.820\n in the game, so effectively doing monarchy things.\n\n1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:12.540\n But then on top of that, we have actual bad actors\n\n1:34:12.540 --> 1:34:14.980\n who are intentionally trying to, like,\n\n1:34:14.980 --> 1:34:17.420\n manipulate the other side into doing things.\n\n1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:19.660\n And using, so because it's a digital space,\n\n1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:24.500\n they're able to use artificial actors, meaning bots.\n\n1:34:24.500 --> 1:34:26.180\n Exactly, botnets, you know,\n\n1:34:26.180 --> 1:34:29.780\n and this is a whole new situation\n\n1:34:29.780 --> 1:34:30.900\n that we've never had before.\n\n1:34:30.900 --> 1:34:32.340\n Yeah, it's exciting.\n\n1:34:32.340 --> 1:34:34.020\n You know what I want to do?\n\n1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:36.180\n You know what I want to do that,\n\n1:34:36.180 --> 1:34:38.140\n because there is, you know, people are talking about bots\n\n1:34:38.140 --> 1:34:41.580\n manipulating and, like, malicious bots\n\n1:34:41.580 --> 1:34:43.580\n that are basically spreading propaganda.\n\n1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:46.580\n I want to create, like, a bot army for, like,\n\n1:34:46.580 --> 1:34:47.620\n that fights that. For love?\n\n1:34:47.620 --> 1:34:50.940\n Yeah, exactly, for love, that fights, that, I mean.\n\n1:34:50.940 --> 1:34:52.220\n You know, there's, I mean, there's truth\n\n1:34:52.220 --> 1:34:54.140\n to fight fire with fire, it's like,\n\n1:34:54.140 --> 1:34:57.100\n but how you always have to be careful\n\n1:34:57.100 --> 1:34:59.940\n whenever you create, again, like,\n\n1:34:59.940 --> 1:35:01.860\n Moloch is very tricky. Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:35:01.860 --> 1:35:03.740\n Hitler was trying to spread the love, too.\n\n1:35:03.740 --> 1:35:07.020\n Well, yeah, so we thought, but, you know, I agree with you\n\n1:35:07.020 --> 1:35:09.140\n that, like, that is a thing that should be considered,\n\n1:35:09.140 --> 1:35:11.460\n but there is, again, everyone,\n\n1:35:11.460 --> 1:35:13.580\n the road to hell is paved in good intentions.\n\n1:35:13.580 --> 1:35:18.100\n And this is, there's always unforeseen circumstances,\n\n1:35:18.100 --> 1:35:20.380\n you know, outcomes, externalities\n\n1:35:20.380 --> 1:35:21.420\n of you trying to adopt a thing,\n\n1:35:21.420 --> 1:35:23.580\n even if you do it in the very best of faith.\n\n1:35:23.580 --> 1:35:25.020\n But you can learn lessons of history.\n\n1:35:25.020 --> 1:35:28.540\n If you can run some sims on it first, absolutely.\n\n1:35:28.540 --> 1:35:30.980\n But also there's certain aspects of a system,\n\n1:35:30.980 --> 1:35:33.980\n as we've learned through history, that do better than others.\n\n1:35:33.980 --> 1:35:36.100\n Like, for example, don't have a dictator,\n\n1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:39.620\n so, like, if I were to create this bot army,\n\n1:35:39.620 --> 1:35:42.900\n it's not good for me to have full control over it.\n\n1:35:42.900 --> 1:35:45.340\n Because in the beginning, I might have a good understanding\n\n1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:47.620\n of what's good and not, but over time,\n\n1:35:47.620 --> 1:35:49.140\n that starts to get deviated,\n\n1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:50.700\n because I'll get annoyed at some assholes,\n\n1:35:50.700 --> 1:35:52.540\n and I'll think, okay, wouldn't it be nice\n\n1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:53.980\n to get rid of those assholes?\n\n1:35:53.980 --> 1:35:55.660\n But then that power starts getting to your head,\n\n1:35:55.660 --> 1:35:58.020\n you become corrupted, that's basic human nature.\n\n1:35:58.020 --> 1:35:59.940\n So distribute the power somehow.\n\n1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:04.460\n We need a love botnet on a DAO.\n\n1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:07.780\n A DAO love botnet.\n\n1:36:07.780 --> 1:36:10.700\n Yeah, and without a leader, like without...\n\n1:36:10.700 --> 1:36:12.340\n Well, exactly, a distributed, right,\n\n1:36:12.340 --> 1:36:14.300\n but yeah, without any kind of centralized...\n\n1:36:14.300 --> 1:36:16.100\n Yeah, without even, you know,\n\n1:36:16.100 --> 1:36:17.500\n basically it's the more control,\n\n1:36:17.500 --> 1:36:21.420\n the more you can decentralize the control of a thing\n\n1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:25.180\n to people, you know, but the balance...\n\n1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:26.700\n But then you still need the ability to coordinate,\n\n1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:29.420\n because that's the issue when something is too,\n\n1:36:29.420 --> 1:36:32.460\n you know, that's really, to me, like the culture wars,\n\n1:36:32.460 --> 1:36:35.660\n the bigger war we're dealing with is actually between\n\n1:36:35.660 --> 1:36:39.580\n the sort of the, I don't know what even the term is for it,\n\n1:36:39.580 --> 1:36:41.980\n but like centralization versus decentralization.\n\n1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:44.100\n That's the tension we're seeing.\n\n1:36:44.100 --> 1:36:48.220\n Power in control by a few versus completely distributed.\n\n1:36:48.220 --> 1:36:50.860\n And the trouble is if you have a fully centralized thing,\n\n1:36:50.860 --> 1:36:52.700\n then you're at risk of tyranny, you know,\n\n1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:56.860\n Stalin type things can happen, or completely distributed.\n\n1:36:56.860 --> 1:36:58.500\n Now you're at risk of complete anarchy and chaos\n\n1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:01.100\n but you can't even coordinate to like on, you know,\n\n1:37:01.100 --> 1:37:03.220\n when there's like a pandemic or anything like that.\n\n1:37:03.220 --> 1:37:05.780\n So it's like, what is the right balance to strike\n\n1:37:05.780 --> 1:37:08.100\n between these two structures?\n\n1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:09.660\n Can't Moloch really take hold\n\n1:37:09.660 --> 1:37:11.060\n in a fully decentralized system?\n\n1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:12.500\n That's one of the dangers too.\n\n1:37:12.500 --> 1:37:14.420\n Yes, very vulnerable to Moloch.\n\n1:37:14.420 --> 1:37:17.740\n So a dictator can commit huge atrocities,\n\n1:37:17.740 --> 1:37:20.980\n but they can also make sure the infrastructure works\n\n1:37:20.980 --> 1:37:23.180\n and trains run on time.\n\n1:37:23.180 --> 1:37:24.820\n They have that God's eye view at least.\n\n1:37:24.820 --> 1:37:27.340\n They have the ability to create like laws and rules\n\n1:37:27.340 --> 1:37:30.900\n that like force coordination, which stops Moloch.\n\n1:37:30.900 --> 1:37:33.260\n But then you're vulnerable to that dictator\n\n1:37:33.260 --> 1:37:34.660\n getting infected with like this,\n\n1:37:34.660 --> 1:37:36.940\n with some kind of psychopathy type thing.\n\n1:37:36.940 --> 1:37:39.460\n What's reverse Moloch?\n\n1:37:39.460 --> 1:37:40.580\n Sorry, great question.\n\n1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:45.580\n So that's where, so I've been working on this series.\n\n1:37:46.220 --> 1:37:48.260\n It's been driving me insane for the last year and a half.\n\n1:37:48.260 --> 1:37:50.100\n I did the first one a year ago.\n\n1:37:50.100 --> 1:37:52.060\n I can't believe it's nearly been a year.\n\n1:37:52.060 --> 1:37:53.500\n The second one, hopefully will be coming out\n\n1:37:53.500 --> 1:37:54.340\n in like a month.\n\n1:37:54.340 --> 1:37:58.700\n And my goal at the end of the series is to like present,\n\n1:37:58.700 --> 1:38:00.180\n cause basically I'm painting the picture of like\n\n1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:02.220\n what Moloch is and how it's affecting\n\n1:38:02.220 --> 1:38:04.300\n almost all these issues in our society\n\n1:38:04.300 --> 1:38:06.420\n and how it's driving.\n\n1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:07.940\n It's like kind of the generator function\n\n1:38:07.940 --> 1:38:11.020\n as people describe it of existential risk.\n\n1:38:11.020 --> 1:38:11.860\n And then at the end of that.\n\n1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:14.180\n Wait, wait, the generator function of existential risk.\n\n1:38:14.180 --> 1:38:16.460\n So you're saying Moloch is sort of the engine\n\n1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:19.660\n that creates a bunch of X risks.\n\n1:38:19.660 --> 1:38:20.540\n Yes, not all of them.\n\n1:38:20.540 --> 1:38:22.940\n Like a, you know, a.\n\n1:38:22.940 --> 1:38:24.620\n Just a cool phrase, generator function.\n\n1:38:24.620 --> 1:38:25.460\n It's not my phrase.\n\n1:38:25.460 --> 1:38:26.780\n It's Daniel Schmacktenberger.\n\n1:38:26.780 --> 1:38:27.620\n Oh, Schmacktenberger.\n\n1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:28.460\n I got that from him.\n\n1:38:28.460 --> 1:38:29.300\n Of course.\n\n1:38:29.300 --> 1:38:31.380\n All things, it's like all roads lead back\n\n1:38:31.380 --> 1:38:32.740\n to Daniel Schmacktenberger, I think.\n\n1:38:32.740 --> 1:38:35.220\n The dude is, the dude is brilliant.\n\n1:38:35.220 --> 1:38:36.060\n He's really brilliant.\n\n1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:37.260\n After that it's Mark Twain.\n\n1:38:37.260 --> 1:38:39.540\n But anyway, sorry.\n\n1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:41.140\n Totally rude interruptions from me.\n\n1:38:41.140 --> 1:38:42.020\n No, it's fine.\n\n1:38:42.020 --> 1:38:43.100\n So not all X risks.\n\n1:38:43.100 --> 1:38:45.460\n So like an asteroid technically isn't\n\n1:38:45.460 --> 1:38:47.940\n because it's, you know, it's just like\n\n1:38:47.940 --> 1:38:49.500\n this one big external thing.\n\n1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:51.580\n It's not like a competition thing going on.\n\n1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:54.700\n But, you know, synthetic bio, you know,\n\n1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:57.540\n bio weapons, that's one because everyone's incentivized\n\n1:38:57.540 --> 1:38:59.740\n to build, even for defense, you know,\n\n1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:01.460\n bad, bad viruses, you know,\n\n1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:03.820\n just to threaten someone else, et cetera.\n\n1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:05.820\n Or AI, technically the race to AGI\n\n1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:08.140\n is kind of potentially a Molochi situation.\n\n1:39:09.620 --> 1:39:14.620\n But yeah, so if Moloch is this like generator function\n\n1:39:15.060 --> 1:39:16.780\n that's driving all of these issues\n\n1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:19.100\n over the coming century that might wipe us out,\n\n1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:20.340\n what's the inverse?\n\n1:39:20.340 --> 1:39:24.100\n And so far what I've gotten to is this character\n\n1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:26.660\n that I want to put out there called Winwin.\n\n1:39:26.660 --> 1:39:28.660\n Because Moloch is the God of lose, lose, ultimately.\n\n1:39:28.660 --> 1:39:30.260\n It masquerades as the God of win, lose,\n\n1:39:30.260 --> 1:39:31.780\n but in reality it's lose, lose.\n\n1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:33.460\n Everyone ends up worse off.\n\n1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:35.860\n So I was like, well, what's the opposite of that?\n\n1:39:35.860 --> 1:39:36.700\n It's Winwin.\n\n1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:37.660\n And I was thinking for ages, like,\n\n1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:39.740\n what's a good name for this character?\n\n1:39:39.740 --> 1:39:42.380\n And then tomorrow I was like, okay, well,\n\n1:39:42.380 --> 1:39:44.700\n don't try and, you know, think through it logically.\n\n1:39:44.700 --> 1:39:46.540\n What's the vibe of Winwin?\n\n1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:49.220\n And to me, like in my mind, Moloch is like,\n\n1:39:49.220 --> 1:39:50.580\n and I addressed that in the video,\n\n1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:52.140\n like it's red and black.\n\n1:39:52.140 --> 1:39:55.660\n It's kind of like very, you know, hyper focused\n\n1:39:55.660 --> 1:39:57.580\n on it's one goal you must win.\n\n1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:01.420\n So Winwin is kind of actually like these colors.\n\n1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:03.020\n It's like purple, turquoise.\n\n1:40:04.140 --> 1:40:06.700\n It's loves games too.\n\n1:40:06.700 --> 1:40:08.420\n It loves a little bit of healthy competition,\n\n1:40:08.420 --> 1:40:10.100\n but constrained, like kind of like before,\n\n1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:12.860\n like knows how to ring fence zero sum competition\n\n1:40:12.860 --> 1:40:14.940\n into like just the right amount,\n\n1:40:14.940 --> 1:40:17.460\n whereby its externalities can be controlled\n\n1:40:17.460 --> 1:40:19.180\n and kept positive.\n\n1:40:19.180 --> 1:40:21.260\n And then beyond that, it also loves cooperation,\n\n1:40:21.260 --> 1:40:23.940\n coordination, love, all these other things.\n\n1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:25.860\n But it's also kind of like mischievous,\n\n1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:28.500\n like, you know, it will have a good time.\n\n1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:30.300\n It's not like kind of like boring, you know,\n\n1:40:30.300 --> 1:40:33.460\n like, oh God, it knows how to have fun.\n\n1:40:33.460 --> 1:40:36.020\n It can get like, it can get down,\n\n1:40:36.020 --> 1:40:39.740\n but ultimately it's like unbelievably wise\n\n1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:41.780\n and it just wants the game to keep going.\n\n1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:44.580\n And I call it Winwin.\n\n1:40:44.580 --> 1:40:47.500\n That's a good like pet name, Winwin.\n\n1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:49.900\n I think the, Winwin, right?\n\n1:40:49.900 --> 1:40:51.740\n And I think it's formal name when it has to do\n\n1:40:51.740 --> 1:40:55.020\n like official functions is Omnia.\n\n1:40:55.020 --> 1:40:55.860\n Omnia.\n\n1:40:55.860 --> 1:40:56.700\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:56.700 --> 1:40:59.540\n From like omniscience kind of, why Omnia?\n\n1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:00.380\n You just like Omnia?\n\n1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:01.220\n She's like Omniwin.\n\n1:41:01.220 --> 1:41:02.060\n Omniwin.\n\n1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:02.900\n But I'm open to suggestions.\n\n1:41:02.900 --> 1:41:04.100\n I would like, you know, and this is.\n\n1:41:04.100 --> 1:41:05.100\n I like Omnia.\n\n1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:05.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:05.940 --> 1:41:08.740\n But there is an angelic kind of sense to Omnia though.\n\n1:41:08.740 --> 1:41:09.980\n So Winwin is more fun.\n\n1:41:09.980 --> 1:41:14.980\n So it's more like, it embraces the fun aspect.\n\n1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:16.420\n The fun aspect.\n\n1:41:16.420 --> 1:41:18.620\n I mean, there is something about sort of,\n\n1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:23.500\n there's some aspect to Winwin interactions\n\n1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:28.500\n that requires embracing the chaos of the game\n\n1:41:31.580 --> 1:41:33.740\n and enjoying the game itself.\n\n1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:34.580\n I don't know.\n\n1:41:34.580 --> 1:41:35.420\n I don't know what that is.\n\n1:41:35.420 --> 1:41:37.660\n That's almost like a Zen like appreciation\n\n1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:40.500\n of the game itself, not optimizing\n\n1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:42.460\n for the consequences of the game.\n\n1:41:42.460 --> 1:41:45.260\n Right, well, it's recognizing the value\n\n1:41:45.260 --> 1:41:47.180\n of competition in of itself about,\n\n1:41:47.180 --> 1:41:48.700\n it's not like about winning.\n\n1:41:48.700 --> 1:41:51.460\n It's about you enjoying the process of having a competition\n\n1:41:51.460 --> 1:41:52.620\n and not knowing whether you're gonna win\n\n1:41:52.620 --> 1:41:53.900\n or lose this little thing.\n\n1:41:53.900 --> 1:41:56.580\n But then also being aware that, you know,\n\n1:41:56.580 --> 1:41:57.420\n what's the boundary?\n\n1:41:57.420 --> 1:41:59.020\n How big do I want competition to be?\n\n1:41:59.020 --> 1:42:02.660\n Because one of the reason why Moloch is doing so well now\n\n1:42:02.660 --> 1:42:04.820\n in our society, in our civilization is\n\n1:42:04.820 --> 1:42:07.820\n because we haven't been able to ring fence competition.\n\n1:42:07.820 --> 1:42:09.380\n You know, and so it's just having all\n\n1:42:09.380 --> 1:42:10.580\n these negative externalities\n\n1:42:10.580 --> 1:42:13.420\n and it's, we've completely lost control of it.\n\n1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.780\n You know, it's, I think my guess is,\n\n1:42:16.780 --> 1:42:18.620\n and now we're getting really like,\n\n1:42:18.620 --> 1:42:20.860\n you know, metaphysical technically,\n\n1:42:20.860 --> 1:42:25.860\n but I think we'll be in a more interesting universe\n\n1:42:26.780 --> 1:42:29.700\n if we have one that has both pure cooperation,\n\n1:42:29.700 --> 1:42:31.340\n you know, lots of cooperation\n\n1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:32.980\n and some pockets of competition\n\n1:42:32.980 --> 1:42:36.220\n than one that's purely competition, cooperation entirely.\n\n1:42:36.220 --> 1:42:39.340\n Like it's good to have some little zero sumness bits,\n\n1:42:39.340 --> 1:42:41.500\n but I don't know that fully\n\n1:42:41.500 --> 1:42:44.100\n and I'm not qualified as a philosopher to know that.\n\n1:42:44.100 --> 1:42:45.460\n And that's what reverse Moloch,\n\n1:42:45.460 --> 1:42:49.620\n so this kind of win, win creature is a system,\n\n1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:52.140\n is an antidote to the Moloch system.\n\n1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:53.580\n Yes.\n\n1:42:53.580 --> 1:42:56.260\n And I don't know how it's gonna do that.\n\n1:42:57.620 --> 1:42:59.980\n But it's good to kind of try to start\n\n1:42:59.980 --> 1:43:01.460\n to formulate different ideas,\n\n1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:03.820\n different frameworks of how we think about that.\n\n1:43:03.820 --> 1:43:04.660\n Exactly.\n\n1:43:04.660 --> 1:43:07.180\n At the small scale of a collection of individuals\n\n1:43:07.180 --> 1:43:09.100\n and a large scale of a society.\n\n1:43:09.100 --> 1:43:09.940\n Exactly.\n\n1:43:09.940 --> 1:43:13.380\n It's a meme, I think it's an example of a good meme.\n\n1:43:13.380 --> 1:43:15.540\n And I'm open, I'd love to hear feedback from people\n\n1:43:15.540 --> 1:43:17.620\n if they think it's, you know, they have a better idea\n\n1:43:17.620 --> 1:43:18.460\n or it's not, you know,\n\n1:43:18.460 --> 1:43:21.660\n but it's the direction of memes that we need to spread,\n\n1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:25.140\n this idea of like, look for the win, wins in life.\n\n1:43:25.140 --> 1:43:27.220\n Well, on the topic of beauty filters,\n\n1:43:27.220 --> 1:43:28.660\n so in that particular context\n\n1:43:28.660 --> 1:43:33.660\n where Moloch creates negative consequences,\n\n1:43:35.140 --> 1:43:37.180\n Dostoevsky said beauty will save the world.\n\n1:43:37.180 --> 1:43:39.140\n What is beauty anyway?\n\n1:43:41.260 --> 1:43:43.780\n It would be nice to just try to discuss\n\n1:43:45.340 --> 1:43:49.300\n what kind of thing we would like to converge towards\n\n1:43:49.300 --> 1:43:52.260\n in our understanding of what is beautiful.\n\n1:43:55.900 --> 1:43:59.220\n So to me, I think something is beautiful\n\n1:43:59.220 --> 1:44:04.220\n when it can't be reduced down to easy metrics.\n\n1:44:04.220 --> 1:44:07.820\n Like if you think of a tree, what is it about a tree,\n\n1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:09.420\n like a big, ancient, beautiful tree, right?\n\n1:44:09.420 --> 1:44:11.780\n What is it about it that we find so beautiful?\n\n1:44:11.780 --> 1:44:16.780\n It's not, you know, the sweetness of its fruit\n\n1:44:17.700 --> 1:44:20.140\n or the value of its lumber.\n\n1:44:20.140 --> 1:44:25.140\n It's this entirety of it that is,\n\n1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:28.020\n there's these immeasurable qualities,\n\n1:44:28.020 --> 1:44:30.020\n it's like almost like a qualia of it.\n\n1:44:30.020 --> 1:44:33.340\n That's both, like it walks this fine line between pattern,\n\n1:44:33.340 --> 1:44:34.620\n well, it's got lots of patternicity,\n\n1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:36.660\n but it's not overly predictable.\n\n1:44:36.660 --> 1:44:39.100\n Again, it walks this fine line between order and chaos.\n\n1:44:39.100 --> 1:44:41.380\n It's a very highly complex system.\n\n1:44:45.380 --> 1:44:47.420\n It's evolving over time,\n\n1:44:47.420 --> 1:44:49.140\n the definition of a complex versus,\n\n1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:50.860\n and this is another Schmackt and Berger thing,\n\n1:44:50.860 --> 1:44:53.500\n a complex versus a complicated system.\n\n1:44:53.500 --> 1:44:55.660\n A complicated system can be sort of broken down\n\n1:44:55.660 --> 1:44:56.980\n into bits and pieces,\n\n1:44:56.980 --> 1:45:00.340\n a complicated system can be sort of broken down into bits,\n\n1:45:00.340 --> 1:45:01.980\n understood and then put back together.\n\n1:45:01.980 --> 1:45:04.740\n A complex system is kind of like a black box.\n\n1:45:04.740 --> 1:45:06.700\n It does all this crazy stuff,\n\n1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:07.940\n but if you take it apart,\n\n1:45:07.940 --> 1:45:09.060\n you can't put it back together again,\n\n1:45:09.060 --> 1:45:11.540\n because there's all these intricacies.\n\n1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:14.740\n And also very importantly, like there's some of the parts,\n\n1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:16.340\n sorry, the sum of the whole is much greater\n\n1:45:16.340 --> 1:45:17.620\n than the sum of the parts.\n\n1:45:17.620 --> 1:45:21.100\n And that's where the beauty lies, I think.\n\n1:45:21.100 --> 1:45:23.300\n And I think that extends to things like art as well.\n\n1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:27.380\n Like there's something immeasurable about it.\n\n1:45:27.380 --> 1:45:29.740\n There's something we can't break down to a narrow metric.\n\n1:45:29.740 --> 1:45:31.580\n Does that extend to humans, you think?\n\n1:45:31.580 --> 1:45:33.580\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:37.180\n So how can Instagram reveal that kind of beauty,\n\n1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:39.060\n the complexity of a human being?\n\n1:45:39.060 --> 1:45:39.900\n Good question.\n\n1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:44.580\n And this takes us back to dating sites and Goodreads,\n\n1:45:44.580 --> 1:45:45.420\n I think.\n\n1:45:46.420 --> 1:45:47.500\n Very good question.\n\n1:45:47.500 --> 1:45:50.020\n I mean, well, I know what it shouldn't do.\n\n1:45:50.020 --> 1:45:52.980\n It shouldn't try and like, right now,\n\n1:45:52.980 --> 1:45:56.180\n you know, I was talking to like a social media expert\n\n1:45:56.180 --> 1:45:58.020\n recently, because I was like, oh, I hate that.\n\n1:45:58.020 --> 1:45:59.860\n There's such a thing as a social media expert?\n\n1:45:59.860 --> 1:46:02.020\n Oh, yeah, there are like agencies out there\n\n1:46:02.020 --> 1:46:03.220\n that you can like outsource,\n\n1:46:03.220 --> 1:46:05.980\n because I'm thinking about working with one to like,\n\n1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:09.260\n I want to start a podcast.\n\n1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:11.860\n You should, you should have done it a long time ago.\n\n1:46:11.860 --> 1:46:12.860\n Working on it.\n\n1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:14.660\n It's going to be called Win Win.\n\n1:46:14.660 --> 1:46:17.420\n And it's going to be about this like positive sum stuff.\n\n1:46:17.420 --> 1:46:21.140\n And the thing that, you know, they always come back and say,\n\n1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:22.980\n is like, well, you need to like figure out\n\n1:46:22.980 --> 1:46:24.060\n what your thing is.\n\n1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:26.420\n You know, you need to narrow down what your thing is\n\n1:46:26.420 --> 1:46:27.980\n and then just follow that.\n\n1:46:27.980 --> 1:46:31.060\n Have like a sort of a formula,\n\n1:46:31.060 --> 1:46:32.180\n because that's what people want.\n\n1:46:32.180 --> 1:46:33.220\n They want to know that they're coming back\n\n1:46:33.220 --> 1:46:34.260\n to the same thing.\n\n1:46:34.260 --> 1:46:37.420\n And that's the advice on YouTube, Twitter, you name it.\n\n1:46:37.420 --> 1:46:40.180\n And that's why, and the trouble with that\n\n1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:42.460\n is that it's a complexity reduction.\n\n1:46:42.460 --> 1:46:44.100\n And generally speaking, you know,\n\n1:46:44.100 --> 1:46:45.340\n complexity reduction is bad.\n\n1:46:45.340 --> 1:46:48.020\n It's making things more, it's an oversimplification.\n\n1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.380\n Not that simplification is always a bad thing.\n\n1:46:51.380 --> 1:46:55.500\n But when you're trying to take, you know,\n\n1:46:55.500 --> 1:46:56.540\n what is social media doing?\n\n1:46:56.540 --> 1:47:00.100\n It's trying to like encapsulate the human experience\n\n1:47:00.100 --> 1:47:04.700\n and put it into digital form and commodify it to an extent.\n\n1:47:04.700 --> 1:47:07.580\n That, so you do that, you compress people down\n\n1:47:07.580 --> 1:47:09.500\n into these like narrow things.\n\n1:47:09.500 --> 1:47:12.700\n And that's why I think it's kind of ultimately\n\n1:47:12.700 --> 1:47:14.460\n fundamentally incompatible with at least\n\n1:47:14.460 --> 1:47:15.300\n my definition of beauty.\n\n1:47:15.300 --> 1:47:19.020\n It's interesting because there is some sense in which\n\n1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:25.180\n a simplification sort of in the Einstein kind of sense\n\n1:47:25.180 --> 1:47:29.300\n of a really complex idea, a simplification in a way\n\n1:47:29.300 --> 1:47:33.900\n that still captures some core power of an idea of a person\n\n1:47:33.900 --> 1:47:36.100\n is also beautiful.\n\n1:47:36.100 --> 1:47:39.340\n And so maybe it's possible for social media to do that.\n\n1:47:39.340 --> 1:47:44.340\n A presentation, a sort of a slither, a slice,\n\n1:47:44.340 --> 1:47:48.420\n a look into a person's life that reveals something\n\n1:47:48.420 --> 1:47:50.220\n real about them.\n\n1:47:50.220 --> 1:47:52.980\n But in a simple way, in a way that can be displayed\n\n1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:55.340\n graphically or through words.\n\n1:47:55.340 --> 1:47:58.460\n Some way, I mean, in some way Twitter can do\n\n1:47:58.460 --> 1:47:59.700\n that kind of thing.\n\n1:47:59.700 --> 1:48:03.540\n A very few set of words can reveal the intricacies\n\n1:48:03.540 --> 1:48:04.660\n of a person.\n\n1:48:04.660 --> 1:48:09.660\n Of course, the viral machine that spreads those words\n\n1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:14.660\n often results in people taking the thing out of context.\n\n1:48:14.660 --> 1:48:18.900\n People often don't read tweets in the context\n\n1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:20.740\n of the human being that wrote them.\n\n1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:24.060\n The full history of the tweets they've written,\n\n1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:26.540\n the education level, the humor level,\n\n1:48:26.540 --> 1:48:30.380\n the world view they're playing around with,\n\n1:48:30.380 --> 1:48:32.460\n all that context is forgotten and people just see\n\n1:48:32.460 --> 1:48:33.620\n the different words.\n\n1:48:33.620 --> 1:48:35.500\n So that can lead to trouble.\n\n1:48:35.500 --> 1:48:39.780\n But in a certain sense, if you do take it in context,\n\n1:48:39.780 --> 1:48:43.260\n it reveals some kind of quirky little beautiful idea\n\n1:48:43.260 --> 1:48:47.180\n or a profound little idea from that particular person\n\n1:48:47.180 --> 1:48:48.540\n that shows something about that person.\n\n1:48:48.540 --> 1:48:51.260\n So in that sense, Twitter can be more successful\n\n1:48:51.260 --> 1:48:54.060\n if we're talking about Mollux is driving\n\n1:48:54.060 --> 1:48:56.060\n a better kind of incentive.\n\n1:48:56.940 --> 1:49:01.940\n Yeah, I mean, how they can, like if we were to rewrite,\n\n1:49:01.980 --> 1:49:05.420\n is there a way to rewrite the Twitter algorithm\n\n1:49:05.420 --> 1:49:10.420\n so that it stops being the fertile breeding ground\n\n1:49:11.620 --> 1:49:12.460\n of the culture wars?\n\n1:49:12.460 --> 1:49:14.260\n Because that's really what it is.\n\n1:49:15.300 --> 1:49:19.340\n I mean, maybe I'm giving it, Twitter too much power,\n\n1:49:19.340 --> 1:49:21.780\n but just the more I looked into it\n\n1:49:21.780 --> 1:49:25.620\n and I had conversations with Tristan Harris\n\n1:49:25.620 --> 1:49:27.620\n from Center of Humane Technology.\n\n1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:29.100\n And he explained it as like,\n\n1:49:30.820 --> 1:49:34.100\n Twitter is where you have this amalgam of human culture\n\n1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:36.180\n and then this terribly designed algorithm\n\n1:49:36.180 --> 1:49:38.420\n that amplifies the craziest people\n\n1:49:39.780 --> 1:49:44.780\n and the angriest most divisive takes and amplifies them.\n\n1:49:45.500 --> 1:49:47.740\n And then the media, the mainstream media,\n\n1:49:47.740 --> 1:49:49.860\n because all the journalists are also on Twitter,\n\n1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:52.860\n they then are informed by that.\n\n1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:55.060\n And so they draw out the stories they can\n\n1:49:55.060 --> 1:49:59.060\n from this already like very boiling lava of rage\n\n1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:03.340\n and then spread that to their millions\n\n1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:05.740\n and millions of people who aren't even on Twitter.\n\n1:50:07.020 --> 1:50:10.820\n And so I honestly, I think if I could press a button,\n\n1:50:10.820 --> 1:50:13.580\n turn them off, I probably would at this point,\n\n1:50:13.580 --> 1:50:14.740\n because I just don't see a way\n\n1:50:14.740 --> 1:50:17.300\n of being compatible with healthiness,\n\n1:50:17.300 --> 1:50:18.660\n but that's not gonna happen.\n\n1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:23.140\n And so at least one way to like stem the tide\n\n1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:25.660\n and make it less malachy would be to change,\n\n1:50:29.980 --> 1:50:31.900\n at least if like it was on a subscription model,\n\n1:50:31.900 --> 1:50:36.900\n then it's now not optimizing for impressions.\n\n1:50:36.980 --> 1:50:38.300\n Cause basically what it wants is for people\n\n1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:40.180\n to keep coming back as often as possible.\n\n1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:42.020\n That's how they get paid, right?\n\n1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:43.740\n Every time an ad gets shown to someone\n\n1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:46.460\n and the way is to get people constantly refreshing their feed.\n\n1:50:46.460 --> 1:50:49.380\n So you're trying to encourage addictive behaviors.\n\n1:50:49.380 --> 1:50:52.300\n Whereas if someone, if they moved on\n\n1:50:52.300 --> 1:50:53.900\n to at least a subscription model,\n\n1:50:53.900 --> 1:50:56.940\n then they're getting the money either way,\n\n1:50:56.940 --> 1:50:59.140\n whether someone comes back to the site once a month\n\n1:50:59.140 --> 1:51:01.020\n or 500 times a month,\n\n1:51:01.020 --> 1:51:02.060\n they get the same amount of money.\n\n1:51:02.060 --> 1:51:04.860\n So now that takes away that incentive,\n\n1:51:04.860 --> 1:51:07.220\n to use technology, to build,\n\n1:51:07.220 --> 1:51:10.500\n to design an algorithm that is maximally addictive.\n\n1:51:10.500 --> 1:51:12.500\n That would be one way, for example.\n\n1:51:12.500 --> 1:51:14.620\n Yeah, but you still want people to,\n\n1:51:14.620 --> 1:51:17.260\n yeah, I just feel like that just slows down,\n\n1:51:17.260 --> 1:51:20.940\n creates friction in the virality of things.\n\n1:51:20.940 --> 1:51:22.260\n But that's good.\n\n1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:24.420\n We need to slow down virality.\n\n1:51:24.420 --> 1:51:26.580\n It's good, it's one way.\n\n1:51:26.580 --> 1:51:28.900\n Virality is malach, to be clear.\n\n1:51:28.900 --> 1:51:33.900\n So malach is always negative then?\n\n1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:36.500\n Yes, by definition.\n\n1:51:36.500 --> 1:51:37.340\n Yes.\n\n1:51:37.340 --> 1:51:39.460\n Competition is not always negative.\n\n1:51:39.460 --> 1:51:40.540\n Competition is neutral.\n\n1:51:40.540 --> 1:51:44.180\n I disagree with you that all virality is negative then,\n\n1:51:44.180 --> 1:51:45.940\n is malach then.\n\n1:51:45.940 --> 1:51:49.500\n Because it's a good intuition,\n\n1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:52.900\n because we have a lot of data on virality being negative.\n\n1:51:52.900 --> 1:51:57.100\n But I happen to believe that the core of human beings,\n\n1:51:57.100 --> 1:52:00.380\n so most human beings want to be good\n\n1:52:00.380 --> 1:52:03.340\n more than they want to be bad to each other.\n\n1:52:03.340 --> 1:52:05.700\n And so I think it's possible,\n\n1:52:05.700 --> 1:52:09.060\n it might be just harder to engineer systems\n\n1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.540\n that enable virality,\n\n1:52:10.540 --> 1:52:13.860\n but it's possible to engineer systems that are viral\n\n1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:15.700\n that enable virality.\n\n1:52:15.700 --> 1:52:19.140\n And the kind of stuff that rises to the top\n\n1:52:19.140 --> 1:52:21.260\n is things that are positive.\n\n1:52:21.260 --> 1:52:24.180\n And positive, not like la la positive,\n\n1:52:24.180 --> 1:52:25.820\n it's more like win win,\n\n1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:28.380\n meaning a lot of people need to be challenged.\n\n1:52:28.380 --> 1:52:29.620\n Wise things, yes.\n\n1:52:29.620 --> 1:52:31.460\n You grow from it, it might challenge you,\n\n1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:34.740\n you might not like it, but you ultimately grow from it.\n\n1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:36.700\n And ultimately bring people together\n\n1:52:36.700 --> 1:52:38.460\n as opposed to tear them apart.\n\n1:52:38.460 --> 1:52:40.540\n I deeply want that to be true.\n\n1:52:40.540 --> 1:52:43.740\n And I very much agree with you that people at their core\n\n1:52:43.740 --> 1:52:46.140\n are on average good, care for each other,\n\n1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:46.980\n as opposed to not.\n\n1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:50.540\n Like I think it's actually a very small percentage\n\n1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:52.900\n of people are truly wanting to do\n\n1:52:52.900 --> 1:52:54.420\n just like destructive malicious things.\n\n1:52:54.420 --> 1:52:56.500\n Most people are just trying to win their own little game.\n\n1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:57.900\n And they don't mean to be,\n\n1:52:57.900 --> 1:53:00.300\n they're just stuck in this badly designed system.\n\n1:53:01.980 --> 1:53:04.620\n That said, the current structure, yes,\n\n1:53:04.620 --> 1:53:09.140\n is the current structure means that virality\n\n1:53:09.140 --> 1:53:10.780\n is optimized towards Moloch.\n\n1:53:10.780 --> 1:53:12.380\n That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions.\n\n1:53:12.380 --> 1:53:14.060\n Sometimes positive stories do go viral\n\n1:53:14.060 --> 1:53:15.140\n and I think we should study them.\n\n1:53:15.140 --> 1:53:17.060\n I think there should be a whole field of study\n\n1:53:17.060 --> 1:53:20.340\n into understanding, identifying memes\n\n1:53:20.340 --> 1:53:24.020\n that above a certain threshold of the population\n\n1:53:24.020 --> 1:53:27.340\n agree is a positive, happy, bringing people together meme.\n\n1:53:27.340 --> 1:53:29.860\n The kind of thing that brings families together\n\n1:53:29.860 --> 1:53:31.700\n that would normally argue about cultural stuff\n\n1:53:31.700 --> 1:53:34.820\n at the table, at the dinner table.\n\n1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:37.420\n Identify those memes and figure out what it was,\n\n1:53:37.420 --> 1:53:40.500\n what was the ingredient that made them spread that day.\n\n1:53:41.380 --> 1:53:44.740\n And also like not just like happiness\n\n1:53:44.740 --> 1:53:45.940\n and connection between humans,\n\n1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:49.580\n but connection between humans in other ways\n\n1:53:49.580 --> 1:53:52.700\n that enables like productivity, like cooperation,\n\n1:53:52.700 --> 1:53:56.180\n solving difficult problems and all those kinds of stuff.\n\n1:53:56.180 --> 1:53:59.020\n So it's not just about let's be happy\n\n1:53:59.020 --> 1:54:00.820\n and have a fulfilling lives.\n\n1:54:00.820 --> 1:54:03.260\n It's also like, let's build cool shit.\n\n1:54:03.260 --> 1:54:04.100\n Let's get excited.\n\n1:54:04.100 --> 1:54:05.100\n Which is the spirit of collaboration,\n\n1:54:05.100 --> 1:54:06.700\n which is deeply anti Moloch, right?\n\n1:54:06.700 --> 1:54:09.300\n That's, it's not using competition.\n\n1:54:09.300 --> 1:54:13.140\n It's like, Moloch hates collaboration and coordination\n\n1:54:13.140 --> 1:54:14.580\n and people working together.\n\n1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:18.060\n And that's, again, like the internet started out as that\n\n1:54:18.060 --> 1:54:20.660\n and it could have been that,\n\n1:54:20.660 --> 1:54:23.380\n but because of the way it was sort of structured\n\n1:54:23.380 --> 1:54:26.860\n in terms of, you know, very lofty ideal,\n\n1:54:26.860 --> 1:54:28.980\n they wanted everything to be open source,\n\n1:54:28.980 --> 1:54:30.620\n open source and also free.\n\n1:54:30.620 --> 1:54:32.820\n And, but they needed to find a way to pay the bills anyway,\n\n1:54:32.820 --> 1:54:33.860\n because they were still building this\n\n1:54:33.860 --> 1:54:36.300\n on top of our old economics system.\n\n1:54:36.300 --> 1:54:37.620\n And so the way they did that\n\n1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:40.260\n was through third party advertisement.\n\n1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:42.780\n But that meant that things were very decoupled.\n\n1:54:42.780 --> 1:54:45.620\n You know, you've got this third party interest,\n\n1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:47.460\n which means that you're then like,\n\n1:54:47.460 --> 1:54:48.980\n people having to optimize for that.\n\n1:54:48.980 --> 1:54:51.300\n And that is, you know, the actual consumer\n\n1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:52.980\n is actually the product,\n\n1:54:52.980 --> 1:54:56.940\n not the person you're making the thing for.\n\n1:54:56.940 --> 1:54:59.820\n In the end, you start making the thing for the advertiser.\n\n1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:01.980\n And so that's why it then like breaks down.\n\n1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:08.260\n Yeah, like it's, there's no clean solution to this.\n\n1:55:08.260 --> 1:55:11.140\n And I, it's a really good suggestion by you actually\n\n1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:16.100\n to like figure out how we can optimize virality\n\n1:55:16.100 --> 1:55:19.540\n for positive sum topics.\n\n1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:22.700\n I shall be the general of the love bot army.\n\n1:55:24.900 --> 1:55:26.220\n Distributed.\n\n1:55:26.220 --> 1:55:28.420\n Distributed, distributed, no, okay, yeah.\n\n1:55:28.420 --> 1:55:30.220\n The power, just even in saying that,\n\n1:55:30.220 --> 1:55:32.220\n the power already went to my head.\n\n1:55:32.220 --> 1:55:35.940\n No, okay, you've talked about quantifying your thinking.\n\n1:55:35.940 --> 1:55:36.980\n We've been talking about this,\n\n1:55:36.980 --> 1:55:39.340\n sort of a game theoretic view on life\n\n1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:42.260\n and putting probabilities behind estimates.\n\n1:55:42.260 --> 1:55:44.260\n Like if you think about different trajectories\n\n1:55:44.260 --> 1:55:45.660\n you can take through life,\n\n1:55:45.660 --> 1:55:48.340\n just actually analyzing life in game theoretic way,\n\n1:55:48.340 --> 1:55:50.820\n like your own life, like personal life.\n\n1:55:50.820 --> 1:55:52.820\n I think you've given an example\n\n1:55:52.820 --> 1:55:54.700\n that you had an honest conversation with Igor\n\n1:55:54.700 --> 1:55:57.780\n about like, how long is this relationship gonna last?\n\n1:55:57.780 --> 1:56:00.140\n So similar to our sort of marriage problem\n\n1:56:00.140 --> 1:56:03.180\n kind of discussion, having an honest conversation\n\n1:56:03.180 --> 1:56:05.620\n about the probability of things\n\n1:56:05.620 --> 1:56:08.580\n that we sometimes are a little bit too shy\n\n1:56:08.580 --> 1:56:11.820\n or scared to think of in a probabilistic terms.\n\n1:56:11.820 --> 1:56:15.060\n Can you speak to that kind of way of reasoning,\n\n1:56:15.060 --> 1:56:17.020\n the good and the bad of that?\n\n1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:20.020\n Can you do this kind of thing with human relations?\n\n1:56:20.900 --> 1:56:25.020\n Yeah, so the scenario you're talking about, it was like.\n\n1:56:25.020 --> 1:56:26.020\n Yeah, tell me about that scenario.\n\n1:56:26.020 --> 1:56:29.940\n Yeah, I think it was about a year into our relationship\n\n1:56:30.900 --> 1:56:34.500\n and we were having a fairly heavy conversation\n\n1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:35.460\n because we were trying to figure out\n\n1:56:35.460 --> 1:56:37.580\n whether or not I was gonna sell my apartment.\n\n1:56:37.580 --> 1:56:40.180\n Well, you know, he had already moved in,\n\n1:56:40.180 --> 1:56:41.780\n but I think we were just figuring out\n\n1:56:41.780 --> 1:56:43.660\n what like our longterm plans would be.\n\n1:56:43.660 --> 1:56:46.340\n We should be by a place together, et cetera.\n\n1:56:46.340 --> 1:56:47.700\n When you guys are having that conversation,\n\n1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:49.820\n are you like drunk out of your mind on wine\n\n1:56:49.820 --> 1:56:52.780\n or is he sober and you're actually having a serious?\n\n1:56:52.780 --> 1:56:53.700\n I think we were sober.\n\n1:56:53.700 --> 1:56:54.940\n How do you get to that conversation?\n\n1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:56.180\n Because most people are kind of afraid\n\n1:56:56.180 --> 1:56:58.780\n to have that kind of serious conversation.\n\n1:56:58.780 --> 1:57:01.540\n Well, so our relationship was very,\n\n1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:03.360\n well, first of all, we were good friends\n\n1:57:03.360 --> 1:57:06.800\n for a couple of years before we even got romantic.\n\n1:57:08.340 --> 1:57:12.460\n And when we did get romantic,\n\n1:57:12.460 --> 1:57:15.780\n it was very clear that this was a big deal.\n\n1:57:15.780 --> 1:57:18.840\n It wasn't just like another, it wasn't a random thing.\n\n1:57:20.420 --> 1:57:22.900\n So the probability of it being a big deal was high.\n\n1:57:22.900 --> 1:57:24.220\n It was already very high.\n\n1:57:24.220 --> 1:57:26.220\n And then we'd been together for a year\n\n1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:28.820\n and it had been pretty golden and wonderful.\n\n1:57:28.820 --> 1:57:32.620\n So, you know, there was a lot of foundation already\n\n1:57:32.620 --> 1:57:33.820\n where we felt very comfortable\n\n1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:35.220\n having a lot of frank conversations.\n\n1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:38.460\n But Igor's MO has always been much more than mine.\n\n1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:39.980\n He was always from the outset,\n\n1:57:39.980 --> 1:57:42.600\n like just in a relationship,\n\n1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:45.340\n radical transparency and honesty is the way\n\n1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:47.100\n because the truth is the truth,\n\n1:57:47.100 --> 1:57:48.420\n whether you want to hide it or not, you know,\n\n1:57:48.420 --> 1:57:50.300\n but it will come out eventually.\n\n1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:55.300\n And if you aren't able to accept difficult things yourself,\n\n1:57:56.540 --> 1:57:58.540\n then how could you possibly expect to be like\n\n1:57:58.540 --> 1:58:00.420\n the most integral version that, you know,\n\n1:58:00.420 --> 1:58:02.940\n you can't, the relationship needs this bedrock\n\n1:58:02.940 --> 1:58:06.620\n of like honesty as a foundation more than anything.\n\n1:58:06.620 --> 1:58:07.700\n Yeah, that's really interesting,\n\n1:58:07.700 --> 1:58:09.960\n but I would like to push against some of those ideas,\n\n1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:13.780\n but that's the down the line, yes, throw them up.\n\n1:58:13.780 --> 1:58:15.260\n I just rudely interrupt.\n\n1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:16.780\n That was fine.\n\n1:58:16.780 --> 1:58:19.860\n And so, you know, we'd been about together for a year\n\n1:58:19.860 --> 1:58:20.700\n and things were good\n\n1:58:20.700 --> 1:58:23.460\n and we were having this hard conversation\n\n1:58:23.460 --> 1:58:25.300\n and then he was like, well, okay,\n\n1:58:25.300 --> 1:58:27.300\n what's the likelihood that we're going to be together\n\n1:58:27.300 --> 1:58:28.300\n in three years then?\n\n1:58:28.300 --> 1:58:31.060\n Because I think it was roughly a three year time horizon.\n\n1:58:31.060 --> 1:58:32.900\n And I was like, ooh, ooh, interesting.\n\n1:58:32.900 --> 1:58:34.260\n And then we were like, actually wait,\n\n1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:35.100\n before you said out loud,\n\n1:58:35.100 --> 1:58:37.760\n let's both write down our predictions formally\n\n1:58:37.760 --> 1:58:38.600\n because we'd been like,\n\n1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:40.460\n we're just getting into like effective altruism\n\n1:58:40.460 --> 1:58:41.860\n and rationality at the time,\n\n1:58:41.860 --> 1:58:43.900\n which is all about making formal predictions\n\n1:58:43.900 --> 1:58:47.400\n as a means of measuring your own,\n\n1:58:48.980 --> 1:58:53.700\n well, your own foresight essentially in a quantified way.\n\n1:58:53.700 --> 1:58:55.500\n So we like both wrote down our percentages\n\n1:58:55.500 --> 1:58:58.660\n and we also did a one year prediction\n\n1:58:58.660 --> 1:58:59.600\n and a 10 year one as well.\n\n1:58:59.600 --> 1:59:02.000\n So we got percentages for all three\n\n1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:03.900\n and then we showed each other.\n\n1:59:03.900 --> 1:59:06.260\n And I remember like having this moment of like, ooh,\n\n1:59:06.260 --> 1:59:08.760\n because for the 10 year one, I was like, well, I mean,\n\n1:59:08.760 --> 1:59:09.600\n I love him a lot,\n\n1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:11.800\n but like a lot can happen in 10 years,\n\n1:59:11.800 --> 1:59:14.260\n and we've only been together for,\n\n1:59:14.260 --> 1:59:16.220\n so I was like, I think it's over 50%,\n\n1:59:16.220 --> 1:59:17.900\n but it's definitely not 90%.\n\n1:59:17.900 --> 1:59:19.020\n And I remember like wrestling,\n\n1:59:19.020 --> 1:59:20.220\n I was like, oh, but I don't want him to be hurt.\n\n1:59:20.220 --> 1:59:21.400\n I don't want him to,\n\n1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:22.700\n I don't want to give a number lower than his.\n\n1:59:22.700 --> 1:59:25.260\n And I remember thinking, I was like, ah, ah, don't game it.\n\n1:59:25.260 --> 1:59:28.100\n This is an exercise in radical honesty.\n\n1:59:28.100 --> 1:59:29.500\n So just give your real percentage.\n\n1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:31.300\n And I think mine was like 75%.\n\n1:59:31.300 --> 1:59:32.400\n And then we showed each other\n\n1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:34.900\n and luckily we were fairly well aligned.\n\n1:59:34.900 --> 1:59:38.640\n And, but honestly, even if we weren't.\n\n1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:39.480\n 20%.\n\n1:59:39.480 --> 1:59:40.320\n Huh?\n\n1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:41.940\n It definitely would have,\n\n1:59:41.940 --> 1:59:45.540\n I, if his had been consistently lower than mine,\n\n1:59:45.540 --> 1:59:48.140\n that would have rattled me for sure.\n\n1:59:48.140 --> 1:59:49.920\n Whereas if it had been the other way around,\n\n1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:50.740\n I think he would have,\n\n1:59:50.740 --> 1:59:53.000\n he's just kind of like a water off a duck's back type of guy.\n\n1:59:53.000 --> 1:59:55.240\n It'd be like, okay, well, all right, we'll figure this out.\n\n1:59:55.240 --> 1:59:57.880\n Well, did you guys provide error bars on the estimate?\n\n1:59:57.880 --> 1:59:58.760\n Like the level of uncertainty?\n\n1:59:58.760 --> 1:59:59.600\n They came built in.\n\n1:59:59.600 --> 2:00:02.220\n We didn't give formal plus or minus error bars.\n\n2:00:02.220 --> 2:00:03.560\n I didn't draw any or anything like that.\n\n2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:05.680\n Well, I guess that's the question I have is,\n\n2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:10.680\n did you feel informed enough to make such decisions?\n\n2:00:12.320 --> 2:00:13.920\n Cause like, I feel like if you were,\n\n2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:16.160\n if I were to do this kind of thing rigorously,\n\n2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:19.060\n I would want some data.\n\n2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:23.080\n I would want to set one of the assumptions you have\n\n2:00:23.080 --> 2:00:25.360\n is you're not that different from other relationships.\n\n2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:26.200\n Right.\n\n2:00:26.200 --> 2:00:29.360\n And so I want to have some data about the way.\n\n2:00:29.360 --> 2:00:30.680\n You want the base rates.\n\n2:00:30.680 --> 2:00:34.400\n Yeah, and also actual trajectories of relationships.\n\n2:00:34.400 --> 2:00:39.080\n I would love to have like time series data\n\n2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:42.840\n about the ways that relationships fall apart or prosper,\n\n2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:46.700\n how they collide with different life events,\n\n2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:48.840\n losses, job changes, moving.\n\n2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:54.520\n Both partners find jobs, only one has a job.\n\n2:00:54.520 --> 2:00:56.320\n I want that kind of data\n\n2:00:56.320 --> 2:00:58.960\n and how often the different trajectories change in life.\n\n2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:03.960\n Like how informative is your past to your future?\n\n2:01:04.400 --> 2:01:05.240\n That's the whole thing.\n\n2:01:05.240 --> 2:01:09.800\n Like can you look at my life and have a good prediction\n\n2:01:09.800 --> 2:01:13.560\n about in terms of my characteristics and my relationships,\n\n2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:15.880\n what that's going to look like in the future or not?\n\n2:01:15.880 --> 2:01:17.200\n I don't even know the answer to that question.\n\n2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:20.740\n I'll be very ill informed in terms of making the probability.\n\n2:01:20.740 --> 2:01:25.680\n I would be far, yeah, I just would be under informed.\n\n2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:26.680\n I would be under informed.\n\n2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:31.240\n I'll be over biasing to my prior experiences, I think.\n\n2:01:31.240 --> 2:01:33.120\n Right, but as long as you're aware of that\n\n2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:34.480\n and you're honest with yourself,\n\n2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:35.760\n and you're honest with the other person,\n\n2:01:35.760 --> 2:01:37.640\n say, look, I have really wide error bars on this\n\n2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:40.440\n for the following reasons, that's okay.\n\n2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:42.040\n I still think it's better than not trying\n\n2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:43.200\n to quantify it at all.\n\n2:01:43.200 --> 2:01:45.220\n If you're trying to make really major\n\n2:01:45.220 --> 2:01:46.760\n irreversible life decisions.\n\n2:01:46.760 --> 2:01:49.480\n And I feel also the romantic nature of that question\n\n2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:52.800\n for me personally, I try to live my life\n\n2:01:52.800 --> 2:01:55.440\n thinking it's very close to 100%.\n\n2:01:55.440 --> 2:01:58.400\n Like, allowing myself actually the,\n\n2:01:58.400 --> 2:02:01.280\n this is the difficulty of this is allowing myself\n\n2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:04.520\n to think differently, I feel like has\n\n2:02:04.520 --> 2:02:06.460\n a psychological consequence.\n\n2:02:06.460 --> 2:02:08.400\n That's where that, that's one of my pushbacks\n\n2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:13.400\n against radical honesty is this one particular perspective.\n\n2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:16.240\n So you're saying you would rather give\n\n2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:20.140\n a falsely high percentage to your partner.\n\n2:02:20.140 --> 2:02:21.840\n Going back to the wide sage filth.\n\n2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:24.560\n In order to sort of create this additional optimism.\n\n2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:25.520\n Helmuth.\n\n2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:26.360\n Yes.\n\n2:02:26.360 --> 2:02:29.360\n Of fake it till you make it.\n\n2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:31.200\n The positive, the power of positive thinking.\n\n2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:32.040\n Hashtag positivity.\n\n2:02:32.040 --> 2:02:35.320\n Yeah, hashtag, it's with a hashtag.\n\n2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:37.440\n Well, so that, and this comes back to this idea\n\n2:02:37.440 --> 2:02:39.760\n of useful fictions, right?\n\n2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:42.920\n And I agree, I don't think there's a clear answer to this.\n\n2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:44.240\n And I think it's actually quite subjective.\n\n2:02:44.240 --> 2:02:46.560\n Some people this works better for than others.\n\n2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:50.120\n You know, to be clear, Igor and I weren't doing\n\n2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:51.960\n this formal prediction in it.\n\n2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:55.520\n Like we did it with very much tongue in cheek.\n\n2:02:55.520 --> 2:02:57.380\n It wasn't like we were going to make,\n\n2:02:57.380 --> 2:03:00.160\n I don't think it even would have drastically changed\n\n2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:02.160\n what we decided to do even.\n\n2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:05.200\n We kind of just did it more as a fun exercise.\n\n2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:06.840\n For the consequence of that fun exercise,\n\n2:03:06.840 --> 2:03:09.920\n you really actually kind of, there was a deep honesty to it.\n\n2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:11.720\n Exactly, it was a deep, and it was, yeah,\n\n2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:13.240\n it was just like this moment of reflection.\n\n2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:14.680\n I'm like, oh wow, I actually have to think\n\n2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:17.840\n like through this quite critically and so on.\n\n2:03:17.840 --> 2:03:22.840\n And it's also what was interesting was I got to like check\n\n2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:25.960\n in with what my desires were.\n\n2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:28.560\n So there was one thing of like what my actual prediction is,\n\n2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:30.400\n but what are my desires and could these desires\n\n2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:32.440\n be affecting my predictions and so on.\n\n2:03:32.440 --> 2:03:34.920\n And you know, that's a method of rationality.\n\n2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:37.080\n And I personally don't think it loses anything in terms of,\n\n2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:38.440\n I didn't take any of the magic away\n\n2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:39.920\n from our relationship, quite the opposite.\n\n2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:42.600\n Like it brought us closer together because it was like,\n\n2:03:42.600 --> 2:03:45.360\n we did this weird fun thing that I appreciate\n\n2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:47.800\n a lot of people find quite strange.\n\n2:03:47.800 --> 2:03:51.800\n And I think it was somewhat unique in our relationship\n\n2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:54.840\n that both of us are very, we both love numbers,\n\n2:03:54.840 --> 2:03:58.320\n we both love statistics, we're both poker players.\n\n2:03:58.320 --> 2:04:01.240\n So this was kind of like our safe space anyway.\n\n2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:04.640\n For others, one partner really might not\n\n2:04:04.640 --> 2:04:06.360\n like that kind of stuff at all, in which case\n\n2:04:06.360 --> 2:04:07.840\n this is not a good exercise to do.\n\n2:04:07.840 --> 2:04:10.600\n I don't recommend it to everybody.\n\n2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:14.280\n But I do think there's, it's interesting sometimes\n\n2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:18.920\n to poke holes in the probe at these things\n\n2:04:18.920 --> 2:04:21.600\n that we consider so sacred that we can't try\n\n2:04:21.600 --> 2:04:24.720\n to quantify them, which is interesting\n\n2:04:24.720 --> 2:04:26.120\n because that's in tension with like the idea\n\n2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:27.440\n of what we just talked about with beauty\n\n2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:28.720\n and like what makes something beautiful,\n\n2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:31.000\n the fact that you can't measure everything about it.\n\n2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:32.960\n And perhaps something shouldn't be tried to measure,\n\n2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:36.400\n maybe it's wrong to completely try and value\n\n2:04:36.400 --> 2:04:39.200\n the utilitarian, put a utilitarian frame\n\n2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:43.320\n of measuring the utility of a tree in its entirety.\n\n2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:44.760\n I don't know, maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't.\n\n2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:46.680\n I'm ambivalent on that.\n\n2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:51.680\n But overall, people have too many biases.\n\n2:04:52.680 --> 2:04:57.080\n People are overly biased against trying to do\n\n2:04:57.080 --> 2:04:59.880\n like a quantified cost benefit analysis\n\n2:04:59.880 --> 2:05:01.560\n on really tough life decisions.\n\n2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:04.000\n They're like, oh, just go with your gut.\n\n2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:07.200\n It's like, well, sure, but guts, our intuitions\n\n2:05:07.200 --> 2:05:09.160\n are best suited for things that we've got tons\n\n2:05:09.160 --> 2:05:11.920\n of experience in, then we can really, you don't trust on it.\n\n2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:13.360\n If it's a decision we've made many times,\n\n2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:16.040\n but if it's like, should I marry this person\n\n2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:19.040\n or should I buy this house over that house?\n\n2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:20.700\n You only make those decisions a couple of times\n\n2:05:20.700 --> 2:05:23.000\n in your life, maybe.\n\n2:05:23.000 --> 2:05:26.940\n Well, I would love to know, there's a balance,\n\n2:05:26.940 --> 2:05:29.240\n probably is a personal balance to strike\n\n2:05:29.240 --> 2:05:33.140\n is the amount of rationality you apply\n\n2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:38.140\n to a question versus the useful fiction,\n\n2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:40.120\n the fake it till you make it.\n\n2:05:40.120 --> 2:05:43.560\n For example, just talking to soldiers in Ukraine,\n\n2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:48.560\n you ask them, what's the probability of you winning,\n\n2:05:49.220 --> 2:05:50.220\n Ukraine winning?\n\n2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:55.680\n Almost everybody I talk to is 100%.\n\n2:05:55.680 --> 2:05:56.880\n Wow.\n\n2:05:56.880 --> 2:05:59.000\n And you listen to the experts, right?\n\n2:05:59.000 --> 2:06:00.800\n They say all kinds of stuff.\n\n2:06:00.800 --> 2:06:01.640\n Right.\n\n2:06:01.640 --> 2:06:05.360\n They are, first of all, the morale there\n\n2:06:05.360 --> 2:06:07.200\n is higher than probably enough.\n\n2:06:07.200 --> 2:06:09.920\n I've never been to a war zone before this,\n\n2:06:09.920 --> 2:06:12.560\n but I've read about many wars\n\n2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:14.920\n and I think the morale in Ukraine is higher\n\n2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:17.320\n than almost any war I've read about.\n\n2:06:17.320 --> 2:06:19.360\n It's every single person in the country\n\n2:06:19.360 --> 2:06:21.720\n is proud to fight for their country.\n\n2:06:21.720 --> 2:06:22.560\n Wow.\n\n2:06:22.560 --> 2:06:25.640\n Everybody, not just soldiers, not everybody.\n\n2:06:25.640 --> 2:06:26.560\n Why do you think that is?\n\n2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:28.660\n Specifically more than in other wars?\n\n2:06:31.920 --> 2:06:36.680\n I think because there's perhaps a dormant desire\n\n2:06:36.680 --> 2:06:40.520\n for the citizens of this country to find\n\n2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:43.280\n the identity of this country because it's been\n\n2:06:43.280 --> 2:06:45.340\n going through this 30 year process\n\n2:06:45.340 --> 2:06:48.400\n of different factions and political bickering\n\n2:06:48.400 --> 2:06:50.960\n and they haven't had, as they talk about,\n\n2:06:50.960 --> 2:06:52.600\n they haven't had their independence war.\n\n2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:55.880\n They say all great nations have had an independence war.\n\n2:06:55.880 --> 2:06:58.920\n They had to fight for their independence,\n\n2:06:58.920 --> 2:07:01.320\n for the discovery of the identity of the core\n\n2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:04.600\n of the ideals that unify us and they haven't had that.\n\n2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:07.220\n There's constantly been factions, there's been divisions,\n\n2:07:07.220 --> 2:07:09.820\n there's been pressures from empires,\n\n2:07:09.820 --> 2:07:12.320\n from the United States and from Russia,\n\n2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:15.680\n from NATO and Europe, everybody telling them what to do.\n\n2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:17.600\n Now they want to discover who they are\n\n2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:21.240\n and there's that kind of sense that we're going to fight\n\n2:07:21.240 --> 2:07:23.280\n for the safety of our homeland,\n\n2:07:23.280 --> 2:07:25.640\n but we're also gonna fight for our identity.\n\n2:07:25.640 --> 2:07:30.640\n And that, on top of the fact that there's just,\n\n2:07:32.040 --> 2:07:33.960\n if you look at the history of Ukraine\n\n2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:36.760\n and there's certain other countries like this,\n\n2:07:36.760 --> 2:07:39.880\n there are certain cultures that are feisty\n\n2:07:39.880 --> 2:07:44.880\n in their pride of being the citizens of that nation.\n\n2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:48.400\n Ukraine is that, Poland was that.\n\n2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:49.480\n You just look at history.\n\n2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:52.800\n In certain countries, you do not want to occupy.\n\n2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:56.880\n I mean, both Stalin and Hitler talked about Poland\n\n2:07:56.880 --> 2:08:00.260\n in this way, they're like, this is a big problem\n\n2:08:00.260 --> 2:08:02.360\n if we occupy this land for prolonged periods of time.\n\n2:08:02.360 --> 2:08:04.680\n They're gonna be a pain in their ass.\n\n2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:07.120\n They're not going to want to be occupied.\n\n2:08:07.120 --> 2:08:09.520\n And certain other countries are pragmatic.\n\n2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:12.200\n They're like, well, leaders come and go.\n\n2:08:12.200 --> 2:08:13.200\n I guess this is good.\n\n2:08:14.400 --> 2:08:16.520\n Ukraine just doesn't have, Ukrainians,\n\n2:08:18.200 --> 2:08:19.280\n throughout the 20th century,\n\n2:08:19.280 --> 2:08:20.760\n don't seem to be the kind of people\n\n2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:25.760\n that just sit calmly and let the quote unquote occupiers\n\n2:08:28.200 --> 2:08:30.160\n impose their rules.\n\n2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:32.400\n That's interesting though, because you said it's always been\n\n2:08:32.400 --> 2:08:35.520\n under conflict and leaders have come and gone.\n\n2:08:35.520 --> 2:08:37.120\n So you would expect them to actually be the opposite\n\n2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:39.160\n under that like reasoning.\n\n2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:42.360\n Well, because it's a very fertile land,\n\n2:08:42.360 --> 2:08:43.480\n it's great for agriculture.\n\n2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:44.800\n So a lot of people want to,\n\n2:08:44.800 --> 2:08:46.520\n I mean, I think they've developed this culture\n\n2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:47.920\n because they've constantly been occupied\n\n2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:51.040\n by different people for the different peoples.\n\n2:08:51.040 --> 2:08:54.600\n And so maybe there is something to that\n\n2:08:54.600 --> 2:08:59.600\n where you've constantly had to feel like within the blood\n\n2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:04.600\n of the generations, there's the struggle against the man,\n\n2:09:04.840 --> 2:09:08.600\n against the imposition of rules, against oppression\n\n2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:10.560\n and all that kind of stuff, and that stays with them.\n\n2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:15.320\n So there's a will there, but a lot of other aspects\n\n2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:18.000\n are also part of it that has to do with\n\n2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000\n the reverse Mollet kind of situation\n\n2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:23.120\n where social media has definitely played a part of it.\n\n2:09:23.120 --> 2:09:25.040\n Also different charismatic individuals\n\n2:09:25.040 --> 2:09:27.160\n have had to play a part.\n\n2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:31.120\n The fact that the president of the nation, Zelensky,\n\n2:09:31.120 --> 2:09:35.160\n stayed in Kiev during the invasion\n\n2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:37.680\n is a huge inspiration to them\n\n2:09:37.680 --> 2:09:41.440\n because most leaders, as you can imagine,\n\n2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:44.520\n when the capital of the nation is under attack,\n\n2:09:44.520 --> 2:09:46.800\n the wise thing, the smart thing\n\n2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:49.080\n that the United States advised Zelensky to do\n\n2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:52.720\n is to flee and to be the leader of the nation\n\n2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:54.720\n from a distant place.\n\n2:09:54.720 --> 2:09:57.160\n He said, fuck that, I'm staying put.\n\n2:09:58.840 --> 2:10:01.720\n Everyone around him, there was a pressure to leave\n\n2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:06.480\n and he didn't, and those singular acts\n\n2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:09.160\n really can unify a nation.\n\n2:10:09.160 --> 2:10:11.360\n There's a lot of people that criticize Zelensky\n\n2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:12.720\n within Ukraine.\n\n2:10:12.720 --> 2:10:17.200\n Before the war, he was very unpopular, even still,\n\n2:10:17.200 --> 2:10:22.080\n but they put that aside, especially that singular act\n\n2:10:22.080 --> 2:10:24.080\n of staying in the capital.\n\n2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:27.760\n Yeah, a lot of those kinds of things come together\n\n2:10:27.760 --> 2:10:31.600\n to create something within people.\n\n2:10:33.360 --> 2:10:35.840\n These things always, of course, though,\n\n2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:42.520\n how zoomed out of a view do you wanna take?\n\n2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:45.000\n Because, yeah, you describe it,\n\n2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:47.960\n it's like an anti Moloch thing happened within Ukraine\n\n2:10:47.960 --> 2:10:49.760\n because it brought the Ukrainian people together\n\n2:10:49.760 --> 2:10:51.760\n in order to fight a common enemy.\n\n2:10:51.760 --> 2:10:53.360\n Maybe that's a good thing, maybe that's a bad thing.\n\n2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:54.200\n In the end, we don't know\n\n2:10:54.200 --> 2:10:56.720\n how this is all gonna play out, right?\n\n2:10:56.720 --> 2:11:01.120\n But if you zoom it out from a level, on a global level,\n\n2:11:01.120 --> 2:11:05.120\n they're coming together to fight that,\n\n2:11:09.000 --> 2:11:12.240\n that could make a conflict larger.\n\n2:11:12.240 --> 2:11:13.120\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:15.680\n I don't know what the right answer is here.\n\n2:11:15.680 --> 2:11:17.600\n It seems like a good thing that they came together,\n\n2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:20.000\n but we don't know how this is all gonna play out.\n\n2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:21.920\n If this all turns into nuclear war, we'll be like,\n\n2:11:21.920 --> 2:11:23.440\n okay, that was the bad, that was the...\n\n2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:26.080\n Oh yeah, so I was describing the reverse Moloch\n\n2:11:26.080 --> 2:11:27.440\n for the local level.\n\n2:11:27.440 --> 2:11:28.280\n Exactly, yes.\n\n2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:32.160\n Now, this is where the experts come in and they say,\n\n2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:37.160\n well, if you channel most of the resources of the nation\n\n2:11:37.520 --> 2:11:42.520\n and the nations supporting Ukraine into the war effort,\n\n2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:45.800\n are you not beating the drums of war\n\n2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:47.480\n that is much bigger than Ukraine?\n\n2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:50.880\n In fact, even the Ukrainian leaders\n\n2:11:50.880 --> 2:11:52.920\n are speaking of it this way.\n\n2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:55.840\n This is not a war between two nations.\n\n2:11:55.840 --> 2:12:00.840\n This is the early days of a world war,\n\n2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:02.440\n if we don't play this correctly.\n\n2:12:02.440 --> 2:12:07.440\n Yes, and we need cool heads from our leaders.\n\n2:12:07.760 --> 2:12:10.200\n So from Ukraine's perspective,\n\n2:12:10.200 --> 2:12:12.640\n Ukraine needs to win the war\n\n2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:15.440\n because what does winning the war mean\n\n2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:20.440\n is coming to peace negotiations, an agreement\n\n2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:24.360\n that guarantees no more invasions.\n\n2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:25.640\n And then you make an agreement\n\n2:12:25.640 --> 2:12:28.560\n about what land belongs to who.\n\n2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:30.240\n And that's, you stop that.\n\n2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:34.120\n And basically from their perspective\n\n2:12:34.120 --> 2:12:36.600\n is you want to demonstrate to the rest of the world\n\n2:12:36.600 --> 2:12:39.640\n who's watching carefully, including Russia and China\n\n2:12:39.640 --> 2:12:42.280\n and different players on the geopolitical stage,\n\n2:12:42.280 --> 2:12:46.000\n that this kind of conflict is not going to be productive\n\n2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:47.240\n if you engage in it.\n\n2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:49.240\n So you want to teach everybody a lesson,\n\n2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:50.920\n let's not do World War III.\n\n2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:53.000\n It's gonna be bad for everybody.\n\n2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:54.760\n And so it's a lose, lose.\n\n2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:56.600\n It's a deep lose, lose.\n\n2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:57.440\n Doesn't matter.\n\n2:13:00.400 --> 2:13:04.160\n And I think that's actually a correct,\n\n2:13:05.680 --> 2:13:10.160\n when I zoom out, I mean, 99% of what I think about\n\n2:13:10.160 --> 2:13:12.320\n is just individual human beings and human lives\n\n2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:14.600\n and just that war is horrible.\n\n2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:15.920\n But when you zoom out and think\n\n2:13:15.920 --> 2:13:17.760\n from a geopolitics perspective,\n\n2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:22.000\n we should realize that it's entirely possible\n\n2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:26.400\n that we will see a World War III in the 21st century.\n\n2:13:26.400 --> 2:13:29.840\n And this is like a dress rehearsal for that.\n\n2:13:29.840 --> 2:13:34.840\n And so the way we play this as a human civilization\n\n2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:39.840\n will define whether we do or don't have a World War III.\n\n2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.320\n How we discuss war, how we discuss nuclear war,\n\n2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:54.320\n the kind of leaders we elect and prop up,\n\n2:13:55.200 --> 2:13:58.480\n the kind of memes we circulate,\n\n2:13:58.480 --> 2:13:59.920\n because you have to be very careful\n\n2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.480\n when you're being pro Ukraine, for example,\n\n2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:06.440\n you have to realize that you're being,\n\n2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:11.520\n you are also indirectly feeding\n\n2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:14.640\n the ever increasing military industrial complex.\n\n2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:17.560\n So you have to be extremely careful\n\n2:14:17.560 --> 2:14:22.560\n that when you say pro Ukraine or pro anybody,\n\n2:14:24.440 --> 2:14:29.440\n you're pro human beings, not pro the machine\n\n2:14:29.440 --> 2:14:34.440\n that creates narratives that says it's pro human beings.\n\n2:14:36.760 --> 2:14:39.920\n But it's actually, if you look at the raw use\n\n2:14:39.920 --> 2:14:44.840\n of funds and resources, it's actually pro making weapons\n\n2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:47.360\n and shooting bullets and dropping bombs.\n\n2:14:47.360 --> 2:14:50.600\n The real, we have to just somehow get the meme\n\n2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:54.560\n into everyone's heads that the real enemy is war itself.\n\n2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:57.040\n That's the enemy we need to defeat.\n\n2:14:57.040 --> 2:15:01.560\n And that doesn't mean to say that there isn't justification\n\n2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:06.560\n for small local scenarios, adversarial conflicts.\n\n2:15:07.280 --> 2:15:11.080\n If you have a leader who is starting wars,\n\n2:15:11.080 --> 2:15:13.720\n they're on the side of team war, basically.\n\n2:15:13.720 --> 2:15:15.240\n It's not that they're on the side of team country,\n\n2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:16.200\n whatever that country is,\n\n2:15:16.200 --> 2:15:17.920\n it's they're on the side of team war.\n\n2:15:17.920 --> 2:15:20.160\n So that needs to be stopped and put down.\n\n2:15:20.160 --> 2:15:21.560\n But you also have to find a way\n\n2:15:21.560 --> 2:15:25.480\n that your corrective measure doesn't actually then\n\n2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:27.360\n end up being coopted by the war machine\n\n2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:28.920\n and creating greater war.\n\n2:15:28.920 --> 2:15:31.080\n Again, the playing field is finite.\n\n2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:35.200\n The scale of conflict is now getting so big\n\n2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:38.840\n that the weapons that can be used are so mass destructive\n\n2:15:40.280 --> 2:15:42.560\n that we can't afford another giant conflict.\n\n2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:44.080\n We just, we won't make it.\n\n2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:48.000\n What existential threat in terms of us not making it\n\n2:15:48.000 --> 2:15:49.640\n are you most worried about?\n\n2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:51.920\n What existential threat to human civilization?\n\n2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:52.760\n We got like, let's go.\n\n2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:53.600\n Going down a dark path, huh?\n\n2:15:53.600 --> 2:15:56.600\n It's good, but no, well, no, it's a dark.\n\n2:15:56.600 --> 2:15:58.560\n No, it's like, well, while we're in the somber place,\n\n2:15:58.560 --> 2:15:59.400\n we might as well.\n\n2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:04.480\n Some of my best friends are dark paths.\n\n2:16:06.680 --> 2:16:07.960\n What worries you most?\n\n2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:12.960\n We mentioned asteroids, we mentioned AGI, nuclear weapons.\n\n2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:17.320\n The one that's on my mind the most,\n\n2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:19.400\n mostly because I think it's the one where we have\n\n2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:21.920\n actually a real chance to move the needle on\n\n2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:24.520\n in a positive direction or more specifically,\n\n2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:26.800\n stop some really bad things from happening,\n\n2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:31.800\n really dumb, avoidable things is bio risks.\n\n2:16:36.160 --> 2:16:37.480\n In what kind of bio risks?\n\n2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:39.320\n There's so many fun options.\n\n2:16:39.320 --> 2:16:41.880\n So many, so of course, we have natural risks\n\n2:16:41.880 --> 2:16:45.000\n from natural pandemics, naturally occurring viruses\n\n2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:49.560\n or pathogens, and then also as time and technology goes on\n\n2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:51.520\n and technology becomes more and more democratized\n\n2:16:51.520 --> 2:16:54.000\n and into the hands of more and more people,\n\n2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:55.920\n the risk of synthetic pathogens.\n\n2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:00.600\n And whether or not you fall into the camp of COVID\n\n2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:03.680\n was gain of function accidental lab leak\n\n2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:05.880\n or whether it was purely naturally occurring,\n\n2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:12.200\n either way, we are facing a future where synthetic pathogens\n\n2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:17.840\n or like human meddled with pathogens\n\n2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:21.840\n either accidentally get out or get into the hands\n\n2:17:21.840 --> 2:17:25.800\n of bad actors who, whether they're omnicidal maniacs,\n\n2:17:25.800 --> 2:17:28.560\n you know, either way.\n\n2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:31.160\n And so that means we need more robustness for that.\n\n2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:33.920\n And you would think that us having this nice little dry run,\n\n2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:36.320\n which is what as awful as COVID was,\n\n2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:39.480\n and all those poor people that died,\n\n2:17:39.480 --> 2:17:42.800\n it was still like child's play compared\n\n2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:45.800\n to what a future one could be in terms of fatality rate.\n\n2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:48.400\n And so you'd think that we would then be coming,\n\n2:17:48.400 --> 2:17:51.000\n we'd be much more robust in our pandemic preparedness.\n\n2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:57.200\n And meanwhile, the budget in the last two years for the US,\n\n2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:02.400\n sorry, they just did this, I can't remember the name\n\n2:18:02.400 --> 2:18:03.320\n of what the actual budget was,\n\n2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:05.440\n but it was like a multi trillion dollar budget\n\n2:18:05.440 --> 2:18:07.360\n that the US just set aside.\n\n2:18:07.360 --> 2:18:09.920\n And originally in that, you know, considering that COVID\n\n2:18:09.920 --> 2:18:12.400\n cost multiple trillions to the economy, right?\n\n2:18:12.400 --> 2:18:14.640\n The original allocation in this new budget\n\n2:18:14.640 --> 2:18:17.320\n for future pandemic preparedness was 60 billion,\n\n2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:20.000\n so tiny proportion of it.\n\n2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.520\n That's proceeded to get whittled down to like 30 billion,\n\n2:18:24.520 --> 2:18:27.960\n to 15 billion, all the way down to 2 billion\n\n2:18:27.960 --> 2:18:28.880\n out of multiple trillions.\n\n2:18:28.880 --> 2:18:31.520\n For a thing that has just cost us multiple trillions,\n\n2:18:31.520 --> 2:18:33.080\n we've just finished, we're barely even,\n\n2:18:33.080 --> 2:18:34.720\n we're not even really out of it.\n\n2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:36.560\n It basically got whittled down to nothing\n\n2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:38.480\n because for some reason people think that,\n\n2:18:38.480 --> 2:18:40.000\n oh, all right, we've got the pandemic,\n\n2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:42.360\n out of the way, that was that one.\n\n2:18:42.360 --> 2:18:44.680\n And the reason for that is that people are,\n\n2:18:44.680 --> 2:18:47.200\n and I say this with all due respect\n\n2:18:47.200 --> 2:18:48.320\n to a lot of the science community,\n\n2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.800\n but there's an immense amount of naivety about,\n\n2:18:52.800 --> 2:18:56.800\n they think that nature is the main risk moving forward,\n\n2:18:56.800 --> 2:18:58.120\n and it really isn't.\n\n2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:00.440\n And I think nothing demonstrates this more\n\n2:19:00.440 --> 2:19:03.240\n than this project that I was just reading about\n\n2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:07.760\n that's sort of being proposed right now called Deep Vision.\n\n2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:10.360\n And the idea is to go out into the wilds,\n\n2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:13.160\n and we're not talking about just like within cities,\n\n2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:15.840\n like deep into like caves that people don't go to,\n\n2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:18.880\n deep into the Arctic, wherever, scour the earth\n\n2:19:18.880 --> 2:19:22.240\n for whatever the most dangerous possible pathogens\n\n2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:24.560\n could be that they can find.\n\n2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:27.960\n And then not only do, try and find these,\n\n2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:31.200\n bring samples of them back to laboratories.\n\n2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:34.240\n And again, whether you think COVID was a lab leak or not,\n\n2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:35.560\n I'm not gonna get into that,\n\n2:19:35.560 --> 2:19:38.520\n but we have historically had so many, as a civilization,\n\n2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:40.760\n we've had so many lab leaks\n\n2:19:40.760 --> 2:19:42.800\n from even like the highest level security things.\n\n2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:45.680\n Like it's just, people should go and just read it.\n\n2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:48.680\n It's like a comedy show of just how many they are,\n\n2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:50.280\n how leaky these labs are,\n\n2:19:50.280 --> 2:19:52.720\n even when they do their best efforts.\n\n2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:55.680\n So bring these things then back to civilization.\n\n2:19:55.680 --> 2:19:57.240\n That's step one of the badness.\n\n2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:01.040\n Then the next step would be to then categorize them,\n\n2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:02.600\n do experiments on them and categorize them\n\n2:20:02.600 --> 2:20:04.320\n by their level of potential.\n\n2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:07.320\n And then the piece de resistance on this plan\n\n2:20:07.320 --> 2:20:11.560\n is to then publish that information freely on the internet\n\n2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:13.720\n about all these pathogens, including their genome,\n\n2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:15.680\n which is literally like the building instructions\n\n2:20:15.680 --> 2:20:18.080\n of how to do them on the internet.\n\n2:20:18.080 --> 2:20:20.280\n And this is something that genuinely,\n\n2:20:20.280 --> 2:20:23.080\n a pocket of the like bio,\n\n2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:26.560\n of the scientific community thinks is a good idea.\n\n2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:28.880\n And I think on expectation, like the,\n\n2:20:28.880 --> 2:20:31.440\n and their argument is, is that, oh, this is good,\n\n2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:35.360\n because it might buy us some time to develop the vaccines,\n\n2:20:35.360 --> 2:20:37.880\n which, okay, sure, maybe would have made sense\n\n2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:40.480\n prior to mRNA technology, but you know, like they,\n\n2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:43.760\n mRNA, we can develop a vaccine now\n\n2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:46.880\n when we find a new pathogen within a couple of days.\n\n2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:48.520\n Now then there's all the trials and so on.\n\n2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:50.040\n Those trials would have to happen anyway,\n\n2:20:50.040 --> 2:20:51.440\n in the case of a brand new thing.\n\n2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:53.400\n So you're saving maybe a couple of days.\n\n2:20:53.400 --> 2:20:54.520\n So that's the upside.\n\n2:20:54.520 --> 2:20:58.160\n Meanwhile, the downside is you're not only giving,\n\n2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:00.000\n you're not only giving the vaccine,\n\n2:21:00.000 --> 2:21:03.200\n you're bringing the risk of these pathogens\n\n2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:04.040\n of like getting leaked,\n\n2:21:04.040 --> 2:21:06.400\n but you're literally handing it out\n\n2:21:06.400 --> 2:21:10.320\n to every bad actor on earth who would be doing cartwheels.\n\n2:21:10.320 --> 2:21:13.280\n And I'm talking about like Kim Jong Un, ISIS,\n\n2:21:13.280 --> 2:21:14.880\n people who like want,\n\n2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:17.200\n they think the rest of the world is their enemy.\n\n2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:19.760\n And in some cases they think that killing it themselves\n\n2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:22.680\n is like a noble cause.\n\n2:21:22.680 --> 2:21:24.240\n And you're literally giving them the building blocks\n\n2:21:24.240 --> 2:21:25.080\n of how to do this.\n\n2:21:25.080 --> 2:21:26.920\n It's the most batshit idea I've ever heard.\n\n2:21:26.920 --> 2:21:29.560\n Like on expectation, it's probably like minus EV\n\n2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:31.640\n of like multiple billions of lives\n\n2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:33.440\n if they actually succeeded in doing this.\n\n2:21:33.440 --> 2:21:35.760\n Certainly in the tens or hundreds of millions.\n\n2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:38.840\n So the cost benefit is so unbelievably, it makes no sense.\n\n2:21:38.840 --> 2:21:42.120\n And I was trying to wrap my head around like why,\n\n2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.920\n like what's going wrong in people's minds\n\n2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:46.640\n to think that this is a good idea?\n\n2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:50.000\n And it's not that it's malice or anything like that.\n\n2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.600\n I think it's that people don't,\n\n2:21:53.600 --> 2:21:57.400\n the proponents, they're actually overly naive\n\n2:21:57.400 --> 2:22:00.680\n about the interactions of humanity.\n\n2:22:00.680 --> 2:22:02.880\n And well, like there are bad actors\n\n2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:04.920\n who will use this for bad things.\n\n2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:06.120\n Because not only will it,\n\n2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:08.920\n if you publish this information,\n\n2:22:08.920 --> 2:22:12.200\n even if a bad actor couldn't physically make it themselves,\n\n2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:14.080\n which given in 10 years time,\n\n2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:18.000\n like the technology is getting cheaper and easier to use.\n\n2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:20.400\n But even if they couldn't make it, they could now bluff it.\n\n2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.960\n Like what would you do if there's like some deadly new virus\n\n2:22:22.960 --> 2:22:26.120\n that we were published on the internet\n\n2:22:26.120 --> 2:22:27.560\n in terms of its building blocks?\n\n2:22:27.560 --> 2:22:28.600\n Kim Jong Un could be like,\n\n2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:31.560\n hey, if you don't let me build my nuclear weapons,\n\n2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:33.600\n I'm gonna release this, I've managed to build it.\n\n2:22:33.600 --> 2:22:35.440\n Well, now he's actually got a credible bluff.\n\n2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:36.440\n We don't know.\n\n2:22:36.440 --> 2:22:39.320\n And so that's, it's just like handing the keys,\n\n2:22:39.320 --> 2:22:42.360\n it's handing weapons of mass destruction to people.\n\n2:22:42.360 --> 2:22:43.200\n Makes no sense.\n\n2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:44.520\n The possible, I agree with you,\n\n2:22:44.520 --> 2:22:48.240\n but the possible world in which it might make sense\n\n2:22:48.240 --> 2:22:53.240\n is if the good guys, which is a whole nother problem,\n\n2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:55.480\n defining who the good guys are,\n\n2:22:55.480 --> 2:22:59.640\n but the good guys are like an order of magnitude\n\n2:22:59.640 --> 2:23:00.920\n higher competence.\n\n2:23:01.840 --> 2:23:06.720\n And so they can stay ahead of the bad actors\n\n2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:10.080\n by just being very good at the defense.\n\n2:23:10.080 --> 2:23:13.720\n By very good, not meaning like a little bit better,\n\n2:23:13.720 --> 2:23:15.880\n but an order of magnitude better.\n\n2:23:15.880 --> 2:23:17.200\n But of course the question is,\n\n2:23:17.200 --> 2:23:21.680\n in each of those individual disciplines, is that feasible?\n\n2:23:21.680 --> 2:23:23.440\n Can you, can the bad actors,\n\n2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:25.840\n even if they don't have the competence leapfrog\n\n2:23:25.840 --> 2:23:29.680\n to the place where the good guys are?\n\n2:23:29.680 --> 2:23:31.600\n Yeah, I mean, I would agree in principle\n\n2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:35.720\n with pertaining to this like particular plan of like,\n\n2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:38.480\n that, you know, with the thing I described,\n\n2:23:38.480 --> 2:23:40.320\n this deep vision thing, where at least then\n\n2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:42.160\n that would maybe make sense for steps one and step two\n\n2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:43.400\n of like getting the information,\n\n2:23:43.400 --> 2:23:45.640\n but then why would you release it,\n\n2:23:45.640 --> 2:23:47.240\n the information to your literal enemies?\n\n2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:49.000\n You know, that's, that makes,\n\n2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:52.560\n that doesn't fit at all in that perspective\n\n2:23:52.560 --> 2:23:53.560\n of like trying to be ahead of them.\n\n2:23:53.560 --> 2:23:55.000\n You're literally handing them the weapon.\n\n2:23:55.000 --> 2:23:56.640\n But there's different levels of release, right?\n\n2:23:56.640 --> 2:24:00.520\n So there's the kind of secrecy\n\n2:24:00.520 --> 2:24:02.440\n where you don't give it to anybody,\n\n2:24:02.440 --> 2:24:05.480\n but there's a release where you incrementally give it\n\n2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:07.720\n to like major labs.\n\n2:24:07.720 --> 2:24:09.400\n So it's not public release, but it's like,\n\n2:24:09.400 --> 2:24:10.240\n you're giving it to major labs.\n\n2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:12.880\n Yeah, there's different layers of reasonability, but.\n\n2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:14.640\n But the problem there is it's going to,\n\n2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:18.160\n if you go anywhere beyond like complete secrecy,\n\n2:24:18.160 --> 2:24:19.720\n it's gonna leak.\n\n2:24:19.720 --> 2:24:21.600\n That's the thing, it's very hard to keep secrets.\n\n2:24:21.600 --> 2:24:23.440\n And so that's still. Information is.\n\n2:24:23.440 --> 2:24:25.920\n So you might as well release it to the public\n\n2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:26.920\n is that argument.\n\n2:24:26.920 --> 2:24:29.600\n So you either go complete secrecy\n\n2:24:29.600 --> 2:24:31.720\n or you release it to the public.\n\n2:24:31.720 --> 2:24:33.960\n So, which is essentially the same thing.\n\n2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.920\n It's going to leak anyway,\n\n2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:38.240\n if you don't do complete secrecy.\n\n2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:39.840\n Right, which is why you shouldn't get the information\n\n2:24:39.840 --> 2:24:40.680\n in the first place.\n\n2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:43.720\n Yeah, I mean, what, in that, I think.\n\n2:24:43.720 --> 2:24:44.920\n Well, that's a solution.\n\n2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:46.640\n Yeah, the solution is either don't get the information\n\n2:24:46.640 --> 2:24:50.880\n in the first place or B, keep it incredibly,\n\n2:24:50.880 --> 2:24:52.240\n incredibly contained.\n\n2:24:52.240 --> 2:24:54.560\n See, I think, I think it really matters\n\n2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:55.800\n which discipline we're talking about.\n\n2:24:55.800 --> 2:24:59.680\n So in the case of biology, I do think you're very right.\n\n2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:02.520\n We shouldn't even be, it should be forbidden\n\n2:25:02.520 --> 2:25:06.640\n to even like, think about that.\n\n2:25:06.640 --> 2:25:08.520\n Meaning don't collect, don't just even collect\n\n2:25:08.520 --> 2:25:11.120\n the information, but like, don't do,\n\n2:25:11.120 --> 2:25:14.880\n I mean, gain of function research is a really iffy area.\n\n2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:15.880\n Like you start.\n\n2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:17.640\n I mean, it's all about cost benefits, right?\n\n2:25:17.640 --> 2:25:19.240\n There are some scenarios where I could imagine\n\n2:25:19.240 --> 2:25:21.280\n the cost benefit of a gain of function research\n\n2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:24.400\n is very, very clear, where you've evaluated\n\n2:25:24.400 --> 2:25:26.760\n all the potential risks, factored in the probability\n\n2:25:26.760 --> 2:25:27.800\n that things can go wrong.\n\n2:25:27.800 --> 2:25:29.760\n And like, you know, not only known unknowns,\n\n2:25:29.760 --> 2:25:32.320\n but unknown unknowns as well, tried to quantify that.\n\n2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.400\n And then even then it's like orders of magnitude\n\n2:25:34.400 --> 2:25:35.400\n better to do that.\n\n2:25:35.400 --> 2:25:36.720\n I'm behind that argument.\n\n2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:38.920\n But the point is that there's this like,\n\n2:25:38.920 --> 2:25:40.960\n naivety that's preventing people from even doing\n\n2:25:40.960 --> 2:25:43.280\n the cost benefit properly on a lot of the things\n\n2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:45.880\n because, you know, I get it.\n\n2:25:45.880 --> 2:25:48.680\n The science community, again, I don't want to bucket\n\n2:25:48.680 --> 2:25:50.240\n the science community, but like some people\n\n2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:52.600\n within the science community just think\n\n2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:54.800\n that everyone's good and everyone just cares\n\n2:25:54.800 --> 2:25:56.880\n about getting knowledge and doing the best for the world.\n\n2:25:56.880 --> 2:25:58.040\n And unfortunately, that's not the case.\n\n2:25:58.040 --> 2:26:00.880\n I wish we lived in that world, but we don't.\n\n2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:02.360\n Yeah, I mean, there's a lie.\n\n2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:05.600\n Listen, I've been criticizing the science community\n\n2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:07.360\n broadly quite a bit.\n\n2:26:07.360 --> 2:26:09.840\n There's so many brilliant people that brilliance\n\n2:26:09.840 --> 2:26:11.280\n is somehow a hindrance sometimes\n\n2:26:11.280 --> 2:26:13.160\n because it has a bunch of blind spots.\n\n2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:16.400\n And then you start to look at the history of science,\n\n2:26:16.400 --> 2:26:19.040\n how easily it's been used by dictators\n\n2:26:19.040 --> 2:26:20.880\n to any conclusion they want.\n\n2:26:20.880 --> 2:26:24.880\n And it's dark how you can use brilliant people\n\n2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:27.160\n that like playing the little game of science\n\n2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:28.800\n because it is a fun game.\n\n2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:30.720\n You know, you're building, you're going to conferences,\n\n2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:32.320\n you're building on top of each other's ideas,\n\n2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:33.240\n there's breakthroughs.\n\n2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:37.040\n Hi, I think I've realized how this particular molecule works\n\n2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:38.560\n and I could do this kind of experiment\n\n2:26:38.560 --> 2:26:39.680\n and everyone else is impressed.\n\n2:26:39.680 --> 2:26:40.520\n Ooh, cool.\n\n2:26:40.520 --> 2:26:41.400\n No, I think you're wrong.\n\n2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.480\n Let me show you why you're wrong.\n\n2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:44.840\n And that little game, everyone gets really excited\n\n2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:47.080\n and they get excited, oh, I came up with a pill\n\n2:26:47.080 --> 2:26:48.040\n that solves this problem\n\n2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:49.480\n and it's going to help a bunch of people.\n\n2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:51.360\n And I came up with a giant study\n\n2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:54.480\n that shows the exact probability it's going to help or not.\n\n2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:56.320\n And you get lost in this game\n\n2:26:56.320 --> 2:27:00.080\n and you forget to realize this game, just like Moloch,\n\n2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:03.040\n can have like...\n\n2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:03.880\n Unintended consequences.\n\n2:27:03.880 --> 2:27:04.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:06.920\n Unintended consequences that might\n\n2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:08.800\n destroy human civilization.\n\n2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:09.640\n Right.\n\n2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:12.840\n Or divide human civilization\n\n2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:17.520\n or have dire geopolitical consequences.\n\n2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:20.320\n I mean, the effects of, I mean, it's just so...\n\n2:27:20.320 --> 2:27:22.880\n The most destructive effects of COVID\n\n2:27:22.880 --> 2:27:25.760\n have nothing to do with the biology of the virus,\n\n2:27:25.760 --> 2:27:26.600\n it seems like.\n\n2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:29.560\n I mean, I could just list them forever,\n\n2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:32.200\n but like one of them is the complete distress\n\n2:27:32.200 --> 2:27:34.160\n of public institutions.\n\n2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:36.360\n The other one is because of that public distress,\n\n2:27:36.360 --> 2:27:38.840\n I feel like if a much worse pandemic came along,\n\n2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:42.440\n we as a world have now cried wolf.\n\n2:27:42.440 --> 2:27:45.440\n And if an actual wolf now comes,\n\n2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:48.360\n people will be like, fuck masks, fuck...\n\n2:27:48.360 --> 2:27:49.200\n Fuck vaccines, yeah.\n\n2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:50.040\n Fuck everything.\n\n2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:51.680\n And they won't be...\n\n2:27:51.680 --> 2:27:53.560\n They'll distrust every single thing\n\n2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:55.960\n that any major institution is going to tell them.\n\n2:27:55.960 --> 2:27:56.960\n And...\n\n2:27:56.960 --> 2:27:57.800\n Because that's the thing,\n\n2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:02.800\n like there were certain actions made by\n\n2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:07.760\n certain health public figures where they told,\n\n2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:10.760\n they very knowingly told it was a white lie,\n\n2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:12.440\n it was intended in the best possible way,\n\n2:28:12.440 --> 2:28:17.440\n such as early on when there was clearly a shortage of masks.\n\n2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:21.520\n And so they said to the public,\n\n2:28:21.520 --> 2:28:25.000\n oh, don't get masks, there's no evidence that they work.\n\n2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.240\n Or don't get them, they don't work.\n\n2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:29.000\n In fact, it might even make it worse.\n\n2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:30.240\n You might even spread it more.\n\n2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:32.280\n Like that was the real like stinker.\n\n2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:35.120\n Yeah, no, no, unless you know how to do it properly,\n\n2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:36.680\n you're gonna make that you're gonna get sicker\n\n2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:38.680\n or you're more likely to catch the virus,\n\n2:28:38.680 --> 2:28:41.320\n which is just absolute crap.\n\n2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:43.160\n And they put that out there.\n\n2:28:43.160 --> 2:28:45.280\n And it's pretty clear the reason why they did that\n\n2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:47.600\n was because there was actually a shortage of masks\n\n2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:50.160\n and they really needed it for health workers,\n\n2:28:50.160 --> 2:28:51.000\n which makes sense.\n\n2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:52.760\n Like, I agree, like, you know,\n\n2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:57.760\n but the cost of lying to the public\n\n2:28:57.840 --> 2:28:59.880\n when that then comes out,\n\n2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:02.720\n people aren't as stupid as they think they are.\n\n2:29:02.720 --> 2:29:05.840\n And that's, I think where this distrust of experts\n\n2:29:05.840 --> 2:29:06.680\n has largely come from.\n\n2:29:06.680 --> 2:29:09.360\n A, they've lied to people overtly,\n\n2:29:09.360 --> 2:29:13.160\n but B, people have been treated like idiots.\n\n2:29:13.160 --> 2:29:14.440\n Now, that's not to say that there aren't a lot\n\n2:29:14.440 --> 2:29:16.160\n of stupid people who have a lot of wacky ideas\n\n2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:18.240\n around COVID and all sorts of things.\n\n2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:21.560\n But if you treat the general public like children,\n\n2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:23.520\n they're going to see that, they're going to notice that.\n\n2:29:23.520 --> 2:29:26.760\n And that is going to just like absolutely decimate the trust\n\n2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:29.520\n in the public institutions that we depend upon.\n\n2:29:29.520 --> 2:29:32.240\n And honestly, the best thing that could happen,\n\n2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:34.720\n I wish like if like Fauci or, you know,\n\n2:29:34.720 --> 2:29:36.880\n and these other like leaders who, I mean, God,\n\n2:29:36.880 --> 2:29:39.760\n I would, I can't imagine how nightmare his job has been\n\n2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:41.040\n for the last few years, hell on earth.\n\n2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:43.480\n Like, so, you know, I, you know,\n\n2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:45.360\n I have a lot of sort of sympathy\n\n2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:46.920\n for the position he's been in.\n\n2:29:46.920 --> 2:29:48.800\n But like, if he could just come out and be like,\n\n2:29:48.800 --> 2:29:51.160\n okay, look, guys, hands up,\n\n2:29:51.160 --> 2:29:53.960\n we didn't handle this as well as we could have.\n\n2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:55.880\n These are all the things I would have done differently\n\n2:29:55.880 --> 2:29:56.720\n in hindsight.\n\n2:29:56.720 --> 2:29:58.680\n I apologize for this and this and this and this.\n\n2:29:58.680 --> 2:30:01.360\n That would go so far.\n\n2:30:01.360 --> 2:30:03.040\n And maybe I'm being naive, who knows,\n\n2:30:03.040 --> 2:30:04.760\n maybe this would backfire, but I don't think it would.\n\n2:30:04.760 --> 2:30:06.240\n Like to someone like me even,\n\n2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:07.360\n cause I've like, I've lost trust\n\n2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:08.840\n in a lot of these things.\n\n2:30:08.840 --> 2:30:10.360\n But I'm fortunate that I at least know people\n\n2:30:10.360 --> 2:30:11.680\n who I can go to who I think are good,\n\n2:30:11.680 --> 2:30:14.320\n like have good epistemics on this stuff.\n\n2:30:14.320 --> 2:30:16.240\n But you know, if they, if they could sort of put their hands\n\n2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:18.240\n on my go, okay, these are the spots where we screwed up.\n\n2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:21.280\n This, this, this, this was our reasons.\n\n2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:22.760\n Yeah, we actually told a little white lie here.\n\n2:30:22.760 --> 2:30:23.720\n We did it for this reason.\n\n2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:24.960\n We're really sorry.\n\n2:30:24.960 --> 2:30:26.760\n Where they just did the radical honesty thing,\n\n2:30:26.760 --> 2:30:28.680\n the radical transparency thing,\n\n2:30:28.680 --> 2:30:32.120\n that would go so far to rebuilding public trust.\n\n2:30:32.120 --> 2:30:33.320\n And I think that's what needs to happen.\n\n2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:34.160\n Otherwise.\n\n2:30:34.160 --> 2:30:35.000\n I totally agree with you.\n\n2:30:35.000 --> 2:30:38.680\n Unfortunately, yeah, his job was very tough\n\n2:30:38.680 --> 2:30:42.920\n and all those kinds of things, but I see arrogance\n\n2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:46.080\n and arrogance prevented him from being honest\n\n2:30:46.080 --> 2:30:47.840\n in that way previously.\n\n2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:49.480\n And I think arrogance will prevent him\n\n2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:51.040\n from being honest in that way.\n\n2:30:51.040 --> 2:30:52.840\n Now we need leaders.\n\n2:30:52.840 --> 2:30:55.440\n I think young people are seeing that,\n\n2:30:55.440 --> 2:30:59.960\n that kind of talking down to people\n\n2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:04.360\n from a position of power, I hope is the way of the past.\n\n2:31:04.360 --> 2:31:06.120\n People really like authenticity\n\n2:31:06.120 --> 2:31:10.600\n and they like leaders that are like a man\n\n2:31:10.600 --> 2:31:12.320\n and a woman of the people.\n\n2:31:12.320 --> 2:31:15.000\n And I think that just.\n\n2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:17.040\n I mean, he still has a chance to do that, I think.\n\n2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:19.280\n I mean, I don't wanna, you know, I don't think, you know,\n\n2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:21.560\n if I doubt he's listening, but if he is like,\n\n2:31:21.560 --> 2:31:25.160\n hey, I think, you know, I don't think he's irredeemable\n\n2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:26.000\n by any means.\n\n2:31:26.000 --> 2:31:28.720\n I think there's, you know, I don't have an opinion\n\n2:31:28.720 --> 2:31:30.680\n whether there was arrogance or there or not.\n\n2:31:30.680 --> 2:31:34.440\n Just know that I think like coming clean on the, you know,\n\n2:31:34.440 --> 2:31:37.600\n it's understandable to have fucked up during this pandemic.\n\n2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:39.400\n Like I won't expect any government to handle it well\n\n2:31:39.400 --> 2:31:42.840\n because it was so difficult, like so many moving pieces,\n\n2:31:42.840 --> 2:31:45.160\n so much like lack of information and so on.\n\n2:31:46.040 --> 2:31:49.320\n But the step to rebuilding trust is to go, okay, look,\n\n2:31:49.320 --> 2:31:51.280\n we're doing a scrutiny of where we went wrong.\n\n2:31:51.280 --> 2:31:53.880\n And for my part, I did this wrong in this part.\n\n2:31:53.880 --> 2:31:55.120\n And that would be huge.\n\n2:31:55.120 --> 2:31:56.000\n All of us can do that.\n\n2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:57.360\n I mean, I was struggling for a while\n\n2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:00.000\n whether I want to talk to him or not.\n\n2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:01.920\n I talked to his boss, Francis Collins.\n\n2:32:03.600 --> 2:32:06.360\n Another person that's screwed up in terms of trust,\n\n2:32:08.040 --> 2:32:10.280\n lost a little bit of my respect too.\n\n2:32:10.280 --> 2:32:14.640\n There seems to have been a kind of dishonesty\n\n2:32:14.640 --> 2:32:19.640\n in the backrooms in that they didn't trust people\n\n2:32:21.080 --> 2:32:23.040\n to be intelligent.\n\n2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:26.000\n Like we need to tell them what's good for them.\n\n2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:27.480\n We know what's good for them.\n\n2:32:27.480 --> 2:32:28.960\n That kind of idea.\n\n2:32:28.960 --> 2:32:33.400\n To be fair, the thing that's, what's it called?\n\n2:32:33.400 --> 2:32:36.360\n I heard the phrase today, nut picking.\n\n2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:37.760\n Social media does that.\n\n2:32:37.760 --> 2:32:39.040\n So you've got like nitpicking.\n\n2:32:39.040 --> 2:32:44.040\n Nut picking is where the craziest, stupidest,\n\n2:32:44.360 --> 2:32:45.880\n you know, if you have a group of people,\n\n2:32:45.880 --> 2:32:47.720\n let's say people who are vaccine,\n\n2:32:47.720 --> 2:32:48.720\n I don't like the term anti vaccine,\n\n2:32:48.720 --> 2:32:51.720\n people who are vaccine hesitant, vaccine speculative.\n\n2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:56.720\n So what social media did or the media or anyone,\n\n2:32:57.320 --> 2:33:01.000\n their opponents would do is pick the craziest example.\n\n2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:02.280\n So the ones who are like,\n\n2:33:02.280 --> 2:33:06.240\n I think I need to inject myself with motor oil\n\n2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:07.920\n up my ass or something.\n\n2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:11.920\n Select the craziest ones and then have that beamed too.\n\n2:33:11.920 --> 2:33:14.680\n So from like someone like Fauci or Francis's perspective,\n\n2:33:14.680 --> 2:33:16.240\n that's what they get because they're getting\n\n2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:17.440\n the same social media stuff as us.\n\n2:33:17.440 --> 2:33:19.000\n They're getting the same media reports.\n\n2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:20.920\n I mean, they might get some more information,\n\n2:33:20.920 --> 2:33:24.880\n but they too are gonna get the nuts portrayed to them.\n\n2:33:24.880 --> 2:33:27.240\n So they probably have a misrepresentation\n\n2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:29.320\n of what the actual public's intelligence is.\n\n2:33:29.320 --> 2:33:31.280\n Well, that's just, yes.\n\n2:33:31.280 --> 2:33:33.640\n And that just means they're not social media savvy.\n\n2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:36.000\n So one of the skills of being on social media\n\n2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:37.880\n is to be able to filter that in your mind,\n\n2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:40.080\n like to understand, to put into proper context.\n\n2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:41.800\n To realize that what you are seeing,\n\n2:33:41.800 --> 2:33:43.960\n social media is not anywhere near\n\n2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:46.600\n an accurate representation of humanity.\n\n2:33:46.600 --> 2:33:49.520\n Nut picking, and there's nothing wrong\n\n2:33:49.520 --> 2:33:51.320\n with putting motor oil up your ass.\n\n2:33:51.320 --> 2:33:54.440\n It's just one of the better aspects of,\n\n2:33:54.440 --> 2:33:56.320\n I do this every weekend.\n\n2:33:56.320 --> 2:33:57.160\n Okay.\n\n2:33:58.280 --> 2:33:59.800\n Where the hell did that analogy come from in my mind?\n\n2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:00.640\n Like what?\n\n2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:01.480\n I don't know.\n\n2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:03.680\n I think you need to, there's some Freudian thing\n\n2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:06.600\n you would need to deeply investigate with a therapist.\n\n2:34:06.600 --> 2:34:08.240\n Okay, what about AI?\n\n2:34:08.240 --> 2:34:13.040\n Are you worried about AGI, super intelligence systems\n\n2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:16.180\n or paperclip maximizer type of situation?\n\n2:34:16.180 --> 2:34:19.940\n Yes, I'm definitely worried about it,\n\n2:34:19.940 --> 2:34:23.220\n but I feel kind of bipolar in the,\n\n2:34:23.220 --> 2:34:24.780\n some days I wake up and I'm like.\n\n2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:26.100\n You're excited about the future?\n\n2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:26.940\n Well, exactly.\n\n2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:29.420\n I'm like, wow, we can unlock the mysteries of the universe.\n\n2:34:29.420 --> 2:34:30.620\n You know, escape the game.\n\n2:34:30.620 --> 2:34:34.340\n And this, you know,\n\n2:34:34.340 --> 2:34:35.740\n because I spend all my time thinking\n\n2:34:35.740 --> 2:34:37.460\n about these molecule problems that, you know,\n\n2:34:37.460 --> 2:34:39.260\n what is the solution to them?\n\n2:34:39.260 --> 2:34:41.780\n What, you know, in some ways you need this like\n\n2:34:41.780 --> 2:34:46.780\n omni benevolent, omniscient, omni wise coordination mechanism\n\n2:34:49.100 --> 2:34:53.260\n that can like make us all not do the molecule thing\n\n2:34:53.260 --> 2:34:55.540\n or like provide the infrastructure\n\n2:34:55.540 --> 2:34:57.460\n or redesign the system so that it's not vulnerable\n\n2:34:57.460 --> 2:34:58.900\n to this molecule process.\n\n2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:01.180\n And in some ways, you know,\n\n2:35:01.180 --> 2:35:02.540\n that's the strongest argument to me\n\n2:35:02.540 --> 2:35:04.940\n for like the race to build AGI\n\n2:35:04.940 --> 2:35:08.020\n is that maybe, you know, we can't survive without it.\n\n2:35:08.020 --> 2:35:12.460\n But the flip side to that is the,\n\n2:35:12.460 --> 2:35:14.900\n the unfortunately now that there's multiple actors\n\n2:35:14.900 --> 2:35:17.780\n trying to build AI, AGI, you know,\n\n2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:19.940\n this was fine 10 years ago when it was just DeepMind,\n\n2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:22.060\n but then other companies started up\n\n2:35:22.060 --> 2:35:23.380\n and now it created a race dynamic.\n\n2:35:23.380 --> 2:35:25.660\n Now it's like, that's the whole thing.\n\n2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:28.020\n Is it the same, it's got the same problem.\n\n2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:31.500\n It's like whichever company is the one that like optimizes\n\n2:35:31.500 --> 2:35:33.620\n for speed at the cost of safety\n\n2:35:33.620 --> 2:35:35.340\n will get the competitive advantage.\n\n2:35:35.340 --> 2:35:37.380\n And so we're the more likely the ones to build the AGI,\n\n2:35:37.380 --> 2:35:40.260\n you know, and that's the same cycle that you're in.\n\n2:35:40.260 --> 2:35:41.580\n And there's no clear solution to that\n\n2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:45.020\n because you can't just go like slapping,\n\n2:35:46.820 --> 2:35:51.140\n if you go and try and like stop all the different companies,\n\n2:35:51.140 --> 2:35:54.620\n then it will, you know, the good ones will stop\n\n2:35:54.620 --> 2:35:55.660\n because they're the ones, you know,\n\n2:35:55.660 --> 2:35:57.700\n within the West's reach,\n\n2:35:57.700 --> 2:35:59.980\n but then that leaves all the other ones to continue\n\n2:35:59.980 --> 2:36:00.980\n and then they're even more likely.\n\n2:36:00.980 --> 2:36:03.140\n So it's like, it's a very difficult problem\n\n2:36:03.140 --> 2:36:04.420\n with no clean solution.\n\n2:36:04.420 --> 2:36:08.580\n And, you know, at the same time, you know,\n\n2:36:08.580 --> 2:36:12.100\n I know at least some of the folks at DeepMind\n\n2:36:12.100 --> 2:36:13.740\n and they're incredible and they're thinking about this.\n\n2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:15.020\n They're very aware of this problem.\n\n2:36:15.020 --> 2:36:17.020\n And they're like, you know,\n\n2:36:17.020 --> 2:36:18.660\n I think some of the smartest people on earth.\n\n2:36:18.660 --> 2:36:20.580\n Yeah, the culture is important there\n\n2:36:20.580 --> 2:36:21.940\n because they are thinking about that\n\n2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:26.180\n and they're some of the best machine learning engineers.\n\n2:36:26.180 --> 2:36:29.780\n So it's possible to have a company or a community of people\n\n2:36:29.780 --> 2:36:31.700\n that are both great engineers\n\n2:36:31.700 --> 2:36:33.740\n and are thinking about the philosophical topics.\n\n2:36:33.740 --> 2:36:36.700\n Exactly, and importantly, they're also game theorists,\n\n2:36:36.700 --> 2:36:38.260\n you know, and because this is ultimately\n\n2:36:38.260 --> 2:36:41.620\n a game theory problem, the thing, this Moloch mechanism\n\n2:36:41.620 --> 2:36:46.620\n and like, you know, how do we voice arms race scenarios?\n\n2:36:47.340 --> 2:36:50.020\n You need people who aren't naive to be thinking about this.\n\n2:36:50.020 --> 2:36:51.980\n And again, like luckily there's a lot of smart,\n\n2:36:51.980 --> 2:36:54.780\n non naive game theorists within that group.\n\n2:36:54.780 --> 2:36:57.660\n Yes, I'm concerned about it and I think it's again,\n\n2:36:57.660 --> 2:37:01.300\n a thing that we need people to be thinking about\n\n2:37:01.300 --> 2:37:03.820\n in terms of like, how do we create,\n\n2:37:03.820 --> 2:37:05.980\n how do we mitigate the arms race dynamics\n\n2:37:05.980 --> 2:37:10.260\n and how do we solve the thing of,\n\n2:37:10.260 --> 2:37:13.580\n Bostrom calls it the orthogonality problem whereby,\n\n2:37:14.500 --> 2:37:16.060\n because it's obviously there's a chance, you know,\n\n2:37:16.060 --> 2:37:17.500\n the belief, the hope is,\n\n2:37:17.500 --> 2:37:19.780\n is that you build something that's super intelligent\n\n2:37:19.780 --> 2:37:22.980\n and by definition of being super intelligent,\n\n2:37:22.980 --> 2:37:25.140\n it will also become super wise\n\n2:37:25.140 --> 2:37:27.820\n and have the wisdom to know what the right goals are.\n\n2:37:27.820 --> 2:37:30.980\n And hopefully those goals include keeping humanity alive.\n\n2:37:30.980 --> 2:37:31.980\n Right?\n\n2:37:31.980 --> 2:37:35.300\n But Bostrom says that actually those two things,\n\n2:37:35.300 --> 2:37:38.340\n you know, super intelligence and super wisdom\n\n2:37:39.220 --> 2:37:40.420\n aren't necessarily correlated.\n\n2:37:40.420 --> 2:37:42.900\n They're actually kind of orthogonal things.\n\n2:37:42.900 --> 2:37:44.820\n And how do we make it so that they are correlated?\n\n2:37:44.820 --> 2:37:45.660\n How do we guarantee it?\n\n2:37:45.660 --> 2:37:47.020\n Because we need it to be guaranteed really,\n\n2:37:47.020 --> 2:37:48.900\n to know that we're doing the thing safely.\n\n2:37:48.900 --> 2:37:53.900\n But I think that like merging of intelligence and wisdom,\n\n2:37:54.460 --> 2:37:56.940\n at least my hope is that this whole process\n\n2:37:56.940 --> 2:37:58.860\n happens sufficiently slowly\n\n2:37:58.860 --> 2:38:01.500\n that we're constantly having these kinds of debates\n\n2:38:01.500 --> 2:38:06.140\n that we have enough time to figure out\n\n2:38:06.140 --> 2:38:07.900\n how to modify each version of the system\n\n2:38:07.900 --> 2:38:09.580\n as it becomes more and more intelligent.\n\n2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:12.020\n Yes, buying time is a good thing, definitely.\n\n2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:14.220\n Anything that slows everything down.\n\n2:38:14.220 --> 2:38:16.060\n We just, everyone needs to chill out.\n\n2:38:16.060 --> 2:38:19.540\n We've got millennia to figure this out.\n\n2:38:19.540 --> 2:38:20.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:21.580 --> 2:38:25.580\n Or at least, at least, well, it depends.\n\n2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:27.820\n Again, some people think that, you know,\n\n2:38:27.820 --> 2:38:29.820\n we can't even make it through the next few decades\n\n2:38:29.820 --> 2:38:31.580\n without having some kind of\n\n2:38:33.260 --> 2:38:36.300\n omni wise coordination mechanism.\n\n2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:37.940\n And there's also an argument to that.\n\n2:38:37.940 --> 2:38:39.380\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n2:38:39.380 --> 2:38:42.220\n Well, there is, I'm suspicious of that kind of thinking\n\n2:38:42.220 --> 2:38:45.220\n because it seems like the entirety of human history\n\n2:38:45.220 --> 2:38:48.580\n has people in it that are like predicting doom\n\n2:38:49.780 --> 2:38:50.780\n just around the corner.\n\n2:38:50.780 --> 2:38:52.700\n There's something about us\n\n2:38:52.700 --> 2:38:56.300\n that is strangely attracted to that thought.\n\n2:38:56.300 --> 2:38:59.700\n It's almost like fun to think about\n\n2:38:59.700 --> 2:39:01.220\n the destruction of everything.\n\n2:39:02.540 --> 2:39:04.340\n Just objectively speaking,\n\n2:39:05.260 --> 2:39:08.180\n I've talked and listened to a bunch of people\n\n2:39:08.180 --> 2:39:11.100\n and they are gravitating towards that.\n\n2:39:11.100 --> 2:39:13.180\n It's almost, I think it's the same thing\n\n2:39:13.180 --> 2:39:15.700\n that people love about conspiracy theories\n\n2:39:15.700 --> 2:39:19.220\n is they love to be the person that kind of figured out\n\n2:39:19.220 --> 2:39:22.140\n some deep fundamental thing about the,\n\n2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:24.780\n that's going to be, it's going to mark something\n\n2:39:24.780 --> 2:39:28.300\n extremely important about the history of human civilization\n\n2:39:28.300 --> 2:39:31.300\n because then I will be important.\n\n2:39:31.300 --> 2:39:33.500\n When in reality, most of us will be forgotten\n\n2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:37.620\n and life will go on.\n\n2:39:37.620 --> 2:39:40.020\n And one of the sad things about\n\n2:39:40.020 --> 2:39:41.980\n whenever anything traumatic happens to you,\n\n2:39:41.980 --> 2:39:46.700\n whenever you lose loved ones or just tragedy happens,\n\n2:39:46.700 --> 2:39:48.220\n you realize life goes on.\n\n2:39:49.140 --> 2:39:52.140\n Even after a nuclear war that will wipe out\n\n2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:55.020\n some large percentage of the population\n\n2:39:55.020 --> 2:40:00.020\n and will torture people for years to come\n\n2:40:00.380 --> 2:40:04.580\n because of the effects of a nuclear winter,\n\n2:40:05.460 --> 2:40:07.260\n people will still survive.\n\n2:40:07.260 --> 2:40:08.700\n Life will still go on.\n\n2:40:08.700 --> 2:40:10.940\n I mean, it depends on the kind of nuclear war.\n\n2:40:10.940 --> 2:40:13.500\n But in the case of nuclear war, it will still go on.\n\n2:40:13.500 --> 2:40:15.820\n That's one of the amazing things about life.\n\n2:40:15.820 --> 2:40:17.060\n It finds a way.\n\n2:40:17.060 --> 2:40:18.940\n And so in that sense, I just,\n\n2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:21.100\n I feel like the doom and gloom thing\n\n2:40:21.100 --> 2:40:23.780\n is a...\n\n2:40:23.780 --> 2:40:24.620\n Well, what we don't, yeah,\n\n2:40:24.620 --> 2:40:26.100\n we don't want a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\n2:40:26.100 --> 2:40:27.500\n Yes, that's exactly.\n\n2:40:27.500 --> 2:40:29.660\n Yes, and I very much agree with that.\n\n2:40:29.660 --> 2:40:32.980\n And I even have a slight feeling\n\n2:40:32.980 --> 2:40:35.780\n from the amount of time we spent in this conversation\n\n2:40:35.780 --> 2:40:36.620\n talking about this,\n\n2:40:36.620 --> 2:40:40.180\n because it's like, is this even a net positive\n\n2:40:40.180 --> 2:40:41.900\n if it's like making everyone feel,\n\n2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:44.980\n oh, in some ways, like making people imagine\n\n2:40:44.980 --> 2:40:47.460\n these bad scenarios can be a self fulfilling prophecy,\n\n2:40:47.460 --> 2:40:51.180\n but at the same time, that's weighed off\n\n2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:54.340\n with at least making people aware of the problem\n\n2:40:54.340 --> 2:40:55.300\n and gets them thinking.\n\n2:40:55.300 --> 2:40:56.260\n And I think particularly,\n\n2:40:56.260 --> 2:40:58.380\n the reason why I wanna talk about this to your audience\n\n2:40:58.380 --> 2:41:00.660\n is that on average, they're the type of people\n\n2:41:00.660 --> 2:41:02.780\n who gravitate towards these kinds of topics\n\n2:41:02.780 --> 2:41:04.260\n because they're intellectually curious\n\n2:41:04.260 --> 2:41:07.860\n and they can sort of sense that there's trouble brewing.\n\n2:41:07.860 --> 2:41:09.420\n They can smell that there's,\n\n2:41:09.420 --> 2:41:10.260\n I think there's a reason\n\n2:41:10.260 --> 2:41:11.460\n that people are thinking about this stuff a lot\n\n2:41:11.460 --> 2:41:14.180\n is because the probability,\n\n2:41:14.180 --> 2:41:16.820\n the probability, it's increased in probability\n\n2:41:16.820 --> 2:41:19.420\n over certainly over the last few years,\n\n2:41:19.420 --> 2:41:21.700\n trajectories have not gone favorably,\n\n2:41:21.700 --> 2:41:24.260\n let's put it since 2010.\n\n2:41:24.260 --> 2:41:28.420\n So it's right, I think, for people to be thinking about it,\n\n2:41:28.420 --> 2:41:30.060\n but that's where they're like,\n\n2:41:30.060 --> 2:41:31.660\n I think whether it's a useful fiction\n\n2:41:31.660 --> 2:41:33.340\n or whether it's actually true\n\n2:41:33.340 --> 2:41:34.420\n or whatever you wanna call it,\n\n2:41:34.420 --> 2:41:35.940\n I think having this faith,\n\n2:41:35.940 --> 2:41:38.060\n this is where faith is valuable\n\n2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:41.140\n because it gives you at least this like anchor of hope.\n\n2:41:41.140 --> 2:41:43.860\n And I'm not just saying it to like trick myself,\n\n2:41:43.860 --> 2:41:44.780\n like I do truly,\n\n2:41:44.780 --> 2:41:47.700\n I do think there's something out there that wants us to win.\n\n2:41:47.700 --> 2:41:49.660\n I think there's something that really wants us to win.\n\n2:41:49.660 --> 2:41:53.060\n And it just, you just have to be like,\n\n2:41:53.060 --> 2:41:55.740\n just like kind of, okay, now I sound really crazy,\n\n2:41:55.740 --> 2:41:58.740\n but like open your heart to it a little bit\n\n2:41:58.740 --> 2:42:03.140\n and it will give you the like,\n\n2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:04.820\n the sort of breathing room\n\n2:42:04.820 --> 2:42:07.660\n with which to marinate on the solutions.\n\n2:42:07.660 --> 2:42:10.340\n We are the ones who have to come up with the solutions,\n\n2:42:10.340 --> 2:42:15.140\n but we can use that.\n\n2:42:15.140 --> 2:42:18.020\n There's like, there's hashtag positivity.\n\n2:42:18.020 --> 2:42:19.300\n There's value in that.\n\n2:42:19.300 --> 2:42:21.300\n Yeah, you have to kind of imagine\n\n2:42:21.300 --> 2:42:24.940\n all the destructive trajectories that lay in our future\n\n2:42:24.940 --> 2:42:27.940\n and then believe in the possibility\n\n2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:29.460\n of avoiding those trajectories.\n\n2:42:29.460 --> 2:42:32.260\n All while, you said audience,\n\n2:42:32.260 --> 2:42:35.100\n all while sitting back, which is majority,\n\n2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:36.660\n the two people that listen to this\n\n2:42:36.660 --> 2:42:38.660\n are probably sitting on a beach,\n\n2:42:38.660 --> 2:42:43.660\n smoking some weed, just, that's a beautiful sunset.\n\n2:42:44.900 --> 2:42:47.900\n They're looking at just the waves going in and out.\n\n2:42:47.900 --> 2:42:50.460\n And ultimately there's a kind of deep belief there\n\n2:42:50.460 --> 2:42:55.460\n in the momentum of humanity to figure it all out.\n\n2:42:56.660 --> 2:42:58.420\n But we've got a lot of work to do.\n\n2:42:58.420 --> 2:43:01.020\n Which is what makes this whole simulation,\n\n2:43:01.020 --> 2:43:02.420\n this video game kind of fun.\n\n2:43:03.380 --> 2:43:05.820\n This battle of polytopia,\n\n2:43:05.820 --> 2:43:08.620\n I still, man, I love those games so much.\n\n2:43:08.620 --> 2:43:09.580\n So good.\n\n2:43:09.580 --> 2:43:11.740\n And that one for people who don't know,\n\n2:43:11.740 --> 2:43:13.700\n Battle of Polytopia is a big,\n\n2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:17.940\n it's like a, is this really radical simplification\n\n2:43:17.940 --> 2:43:20.540\n of a civilization type of game.\n\n2:43:20.540 --> 2:43:24.140\n It still has a lot of the skill tree development,\n\n2:43:24.140 --> 2:43:25.780\n a lot of the strategy,\n\n2:43:27.060 --> 2:43:29.860\n but it's easy enough to play on a phone.\n\n2:43:29.860 --> 2:43:30.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:30.700 --> 2:43:31.540\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n2:43:31.540 --> 2:43:33.260\n They've really figured it out.\n\n2:43:33.260 --> 2:43:35.020\n It's one of the most elegantly designed games\n\n2:43:35.020 --> 2:43:35.860\n I've ever seen.\n\n2:43:35.860 --> 2:43:37.940\n It's incredibly complex.\n\n2:43:37.940 --> 2:43:39.580\n And yet being, again, it walks that line\n\n2:43:39.580 --> 2:43:40.980\n between complexity and simplicity\n\n2:43:40.980 --> 2:43:42.620\n in this really, really great way.\n\n2:43:44.180 --> 2:43:45.180\n And they use pretty colors\n\n2:43:45.180 --> 2:43:49.020\n that hack the dopamine reward circuits in our brains.\n\n2:43:49.020 --> 2:43:49.860\n Very well.\n\n2:43:49.860 --> 2:43:50.860\n Yeah, it's fun.\n\n2:43:50.860 --> 2:43:52.300\n Video games are so fun.\n\n2:43:52.300 --> 2:43:53.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:53.380 --> 2:43:55.540\n Most of this life is just about fun.\n\n2:43:55.540 --> 2:43:57.740\n Escaping all the suffering to find the fun.\n\n2:43:58.820 --> 2:43:59.940\n What's energy healing?\n\n2:43:59.940 --> 2:44:02.220\n I have in my notes, energy healing question mark.\n\n2:44:02.220 --> 2:44:03.140\n What's that about?\n\n2:44:05.500 --> 2:44:06.860\n Oh man.\n\n2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:09.460\n God, your audience is gonna think I'm mad.\n\n2:44:09.460 --> 2:44:13.180\n So the two crazy things that happened to me,\n\n2:44:13.180 --> 2:44:14.980\n the one was the voice in the head\n\n2:44:14.980 --> 2:44:16.100\n that said you're gonna win this tournament\n\n2:44:16.100 --> 2:44:18.260\n and then I won the tournament.\n\n2:44:18.260 --> 2:44:20.940\n The other craziest thing that's happened to me\n\n2:44:20.940 --> 2:44:23.700\n was in 2018,\n\n2:44:25.300 --> 2:44:30.300\n I started getting this like weird problem in my ear\n\n2:44:30.420 --> 2:44:35.260\n where it was kind of like low frequency sound distortion,\n\n2:44:35.260 --> 2:44:37.300\n where voices, particularly men's voices,\n\n2:44:37.300 --> 2:44:39.580\n became incredibly unpleasant to listen to.\n\n2:44:40.660 --> 2:44:42.380\n It would like create this,\n\n2:44:42.380 --> 2:44:44.100\n it would like be falsely amplified or something\n\n2:44:44.100 --> 2:44:46.340\n and it was almost like a physical sensation in my ear,\n\n2:44:46.340 --> 2:44:48.100\n which was really unpleasant.\n\n2:44:48.100 --> 2:44:50.980\n And it would like last for a few hours and then go away\n\n2:44:50.980 --> 2:44:52.540\n and then come back for a few hours and go away.\n\n2:44:52.540 --> 2:44:54.460\n And I went and got hearing tests\n\n2:44:54.460 --> 2:44:56.340\n and they found that like the bottom end,\n\n2:44:56.340 --> 2:44:58.380\n I was losing the hearing in that ear.\n\n2:45:00.140 --> 2:45:03.740\n And in the end, I got,\n\n2:45:03.740 --> 2:45:05.620\n doctors said they think it was this thing\n\n2:45:05.620 --> 2:45:07.220\n called Meniere's disease,\n\n2:45:07.220 --> 2:45:10.540\n which is this very unpleasant disease\n\n2:45:10.540 --> 2:45:12.100\n where people basically end up losing their hearing,\n\n2:45:12.100 --> 2:45:13.260\n but they get this like,\n\n2:45:14.140 --> 2:45:16.260\n it often comes with like dizzy spells and other things\n\n2:45:16.260 --> 2:45:19.540\n because it's like the inner ear gets all messed up.\n\n2:45:19.540 --> 2:45:21.780\n Now, I don't know if that's actually what I had,\n\n2:45:21.780 --> 2:45:23.420\n but that's what at least a couple of,\n\n2:45:23.420 --> 2:45:24.940\n one doctor said to me.\n\n2:45:24.940 --> 2:45:26.980\n But anyway, so I'd had three months of this stuff,\n\n2:45:26.980 --> 2:45:28.820\n this going on and it was really getting me down.\n\n2:45:28.820 --> 2:45:32.540\n And I was at Burning Man of all places.\n\n2:45:32.540 --> 2:45:35.100\n I don't mean to be that person talking about Burning Man,\n\n2:45:35.100 --> 2:45:36.380\n but I was there.\n\n2:45:36.380 --> 2:45:39.140\n And again, I'd had it and I was unable to listen to music,\n\n2:45:39.140 --> 2:45:40.060\n which is not what you want\n\n2:45:40.060 --> 2:45:42.580\n because Burning Man is a very loud, intense place.\n\n2:45:42.580 --> 2:45:44.060\n And I was just having a really rough time.\n\n2:45:44.060 --> 2:45:45.660\n And on the final night,\n\n2:45:45.660 --> 2:45:49.620\n I get talking to this girl who's like a friend of a friend.\n\n2:45:49.620 --> 2:45:51.020\n And I mentioned, I was like,\n\n2:45:51.020 --> 2:45:52.540\n oh, I'm really down in the dumps about this.\n\n2:45:52.540 --> 2:45:53.380\n And she's like, oh, well,\n\n2:45:53.380 --> 2:45:54.940\n I've done a little bit of energy healing.\n\n2:45:54.940 --> 2:45:56.340\n Would you like me to have a look?\n\n2:45:56.340 --> 2:45:57.900\n And I was like, sure.\n\n2:45:57.900 --> 2:45:59.940\n Now this was again,\n\n2:45:59.940 --> 2:46:03.340\n deep, I was, you know, no time in my life for this.\n\n2:46:03.340 --> 2:46:04.900\n I didn't believe in any of this stuff.\n\n2:46:04.900 --> 2:46:06.100\n I was just like, it's all bullshit.\n\n2:46:06.100 --> 2:46:07.420\n It's all wooey nonsense.\n\n2:46:08.980 --> 2:46:10.740\n But I was like, sure, I'll have a go.\n\n2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:14.020\n And she starts like with her hand and she says,\n\n2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:15.340\n oh, there's something there.\n\n2:46:15.340 --> 2:46:18.100\n And then she leans in and she starts like sucking\n\n2:46:18.100 --> 2:46:19.900\n over my ear, not actually touching me,\n\n2:46:19.900 --> 2:46:22.620\n but like close to it, like with her mouth.\n\n2:46:22.620 --> 2:46:23.780\n And it was really unpleasant.\n\n2:46:23.780 --> 2:46:24.780\n I was like, whoa, can you stop?\n\n2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:25.820\n She's like, no, no, no, there's something there.\n\n2:46:25.820 --> 2:46:26.660\n I need to get it.\n\n2:46:26.660 --> 2:46:27.780\n And I was like, no, no, no, I really don't like it.\n\n2:46:27.780 --> 2:46:29.140\n Please, this is really loud.\n\n2:46:29.140 --> 2:46:31.100\n She's like, I need to just bear with me.\n\n2:46:31.100 --> 2:46:31.940\n And she does it.\n\n2:46:31.940 --> 2:46:33.700\n And I don't know how long, for a few minutes.\n\n2:46:33.700 --> 2:46:36.500\n And then she eventually collapses on the ground,\n\n2:46:36.500 --> 2:46:38.540\n like freezing cold, crying.\n\n2:46:40.580 --> 2:46:42.700\n And I'm just like, I don't know what the hell is going on.\n\n2:46:42.700 --> 2:46:44.300\n Like I'm like thoroughly freaked out\n\n2:46:44.300 --> 2:46:45.420\n as is everyone else watching.\n\n2:46:45.420 --> 2:46:46.340\n Just like, what the hell?\n\n2:46:46.340 --> 2:46:47.700\n And we like warm her up and she was like,\n\n2:46:47.700 --> 2:46:51.340\n oh, what, oh, you know, she was really shaken up.\n\n2:46:51.340 --> 2:46:54.700\n And she's like, I don't know what that,\n\n2:46:54.700 --> 2:46:57.580\n she said it was something very unpleasant and dark.\n\n2:46:57.580 --> 2:46:58.700\n Don't worry, it's gone.\n\n2:46:58.700 --> 2:46:59.900\n I think you'll be fine in a couple,\n\n2:46:59.900 --> 2:47:01.420\n you'll have the physical symptoms for a couple of weeks\n\n2:47:01.420 --> 2:47:02.700\n and you'll be fine.\n\n2:47:02.700 --> 2:47:05.740\n But, you know, she was just like that, you know,\n\n2:47:05.740 --> 2:47:10.020\n so I was so rattled, A, because the potential that actually\n\n2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:13.100\n I'd had something bad in me that made someone feel bad\n\n2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:15.340\n and that she was scared.\n\n2:47:15.340 --> 2:47:16.500\n That was what, you know, I was like, wait,\n\n2:47:16.500 --> 2:47:19.300\n I thought you do this, this is the thing.\n\n2:47:19.300 --> 2:47:20.340\n Now you're terrified.\n\n2:47:20.340 --> 2:47:22.540\n Like you bought like some kind of exorcism or something.\n\n2:47:22.540 --> 2:47:24.620\n Like what the fuck is going on?\n\n2:47:24.620 --> 2:47:29.620\n So it, like just the most insane experience.\n\n2:47:29.700 --> 2:47:31.740\n And frankly, it took me like a few months\n\n2:47:31.740 --> 2:47:35.380\n to sort of emotionally recover from it.\n\n2:47:35.380 --> 2:47:39.540\n But my ear problem went away about a couple of weeks later\n\n2:47:39.540 --> 2:47:42.940\n and touch wood, I've not had any issues since.\n\n2:47:42.940 --> 2:47:43.780\n So.\n\n2:47:44.740 --> 2:47:48.140\n That gives you like hints\n\n2:47:48.140 --> 2:47:50.140\n that maybe there's something out there.\n\n2:47:51.060 --> 2:47:53.340\n I mean, I don't, again,\n\n2:47:53.340 --> 2:47:55.180\n I don't have an explanation for this.\n\n2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:57.820\n The most probable explanation was, you know,\n\n2:47:57.820 --> 2:47:59.860\n I was a burning man, I was in a very open state.\n\n2:47:59.860 --> 2:48:01.820\n Let's just leave it at that.\n\n2:48:01.820 --> 2:48:06.820\n And, you know, placebo is an incredibly powerful thing\n\n2:48:08.060 --> 2:48:10.300\n and a very not understood thing.\n\n2:48:10.300 --> 2:48:11.140\n So.\n\n2:48:11.140 --> 2:48:13.740\n Almost assigning the word placebo to it reduces it down\n\n2:48:13.740 --> 2:48:16.500\n to a way that it doesn't deserve to be reduced down.\n\n2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:19.180\n Maybe there's a whole science of what we call placebo.\n\n2:48:19.180 --> 2:48:21.540\n Maybe there's a, placebo's a door.\n\n2:48:21.540 --> 2:48:24.020\n Self healing, you know?\n\n2:48:24.020 --> 2:48:26.380\n And I mean, I don't know what the problem was.\n\n2:48:26.380 --> 2:48:27.700\n Like I was told it was many years.\n\n2:48:27.700 --> 2:48:29.500\n I don't want to say I definitely had that\n\n2:48:29.500 --> 2:48:30.700\n because I don't want people to think that,\n\n2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:32.220\n oh, that's how, you know, if they do have that,\n\n2:48:32.220 --> 2:48:33.180\n because it's a terrible disease.\n\n2:48:33.180 --> 2:48:34.020\n And if they have that,\n\n2:48:34.020 --> 2:48:35.100\n that this is going to be a guaranteed way for it\n\n2:48:35.100 --> 2:48:35.940\n to fix it for them.\n\n2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:37.740\n I don't know.\n\n2:48:37.740 --> 2:48:39.740\n And I also don't, I don't,\n\n2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:41.060\n and you're absolutely right to say,\n\n2:48:41.060 --> 2:48:43.380\n like using even the word placebo is like,\n\n2:48:43.380 --> 2:48:48.020\n it comes with this like baggage of, of like frame.\n\n2:48:48.020 --> 2:48:49.980\n And I don't want to reduce it down.\n\n2:48:49.980 --> 2:48:52.900\n All I can do is describe the experience and what happened.\n\n2:48:52.900 --> 2:48:56.580\n I cannot put an ontological framework around it.\n\n2:48:56.580 --> 2:49:00.100\n I can't say why it happened, what the mechanism was,\n\n2:49:00.100 --> 2:49:02.980\n what the problem even was in the first place.\n\n2:49:02.980 --> 2:49:05.220\n I just know that something crazy happened\n\n2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:07.060\n and it was while I was in an open state.\n\n2:49:07.060 --> 2:49:09.540\n And fortunately for me, it made the problem go away.\n\n2:49:09.540 --> 2:49:11.860\n But what I took away from it, again,\n\n2:49:11.860 --> 2:49:13.580\n it was part of this, you know,\n\n2:49:13.580 --> 2:49:16.020\n this took me on this journey of becoming more humble\n\n2:49:16.020 --> 2:49:17.500\n about what I think I know.\n\n2:49:17.500 --> 2:49:18.860\n Because as I said before, I was like,\n\n2:49:18.860 --> 2:49:21.740\n I was in the like Richard Dawkins train of atheism\n\n2:49:21.740 --> 2:49:23.380\n in terms of there is no God.\n\n2:49:23.380 --> 2:49:24.820\n And everything like that is bullshit.\n\n2:49:24.820 --> 2:49:26.660\n We know everything, we know, you know,\n\n2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:28.980\n the only way we can get through,\n\n2:49:28.980 --> 2:49:30.820\n we know how medicine works and its molecules\n\n2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:33.980\n and chemical interactions and that kind of stuff.\n\n2:49:33.980 --> 2:49:36.580\n And now it's like, okay, well,\n\n2:49:36.580 --> 2:49:39.540\n there's clearly more for us to understand.\n\n2:49:40.820 --> 2:49:43.540\n And that doesn't mean that it's ascientific as well,\n\n2:49:43.540 --> 2:49:47.140\n because, you know, the beauty of the scientific method\n\n2:49:47.140 --> 2:49:49.940\n is that it still can apply to this situation.\n\n2:49:49.940 --> 2:49:51.340\n Like, I don't see why, you know,\n\n2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:54.300\n I would like to try and test this experimentally.\n\n2:49:54.300 --> 2:49:55.540\n I haven't really, like, you know,\n\n2:49:55.540 --> 2:49:57.100\n I don't know how we would go about doing that.\n\n2:49:57.100 --> 2:49:58.860\n We'd have to find other people with the same condition,\n\n2:49:58.860 --> 2:50:02.820\n I guess, and like, try and repeat the experiment.\n\n2:50:04.220 --> 2:50:06.980\n But it doesn't, just because something happens\n\n2:50:06.980 --> 2:50:09.180\n that's sort of out of the realms\n\n2:50:09.180 --> 2:50:10.100\n of our current understanding,\n\n2:50:10.100 --> 2:50:11.940\n it doesn't mean that it's,\n\n2:50:11.940 --> 2:50:13.820\n the scientific method can't be used for it.\n\n2:50:13.820 --> 2:50:17.900\n Yeah, I think the scientific method sits on a foundation\n\n2:50:17.900 --> 2:50:20.220\n of those kinds of experiences,\n\n2:50:20.220 --> 2:50:23.380\n because the scientific method is a process\n\n2:50:24.660 --> 2:50:29.660\n to carve away at the mystery all around us.\n\n2:50:30.980 --> 2:50:33.740\n And experiences like this is just a reminder\n\n2:50:33.740 --> 2:50:36.700\n that we're mostly shrouded in mystery still.\n\n2:50:36.700 --> 2:50:37.540\n That's it.\n\n2:50:37.540 --> 2:50:38.940\n It's just like a humility.\n\n2:50:38.940 --> 2:50:41.580\n Like, we haven't really figured this whole thing out.\n\n2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:44.500\n But at the same time, we have found ways\n\n2:50:44.500 --> 2:50:47.500\n to act, you know, we're clearly doing something right,\n\n2:50:47.500 --> 2:50:50.020\n because think of the technological scientific advancements,\n\n2:50:50.020 --> 2:50:53.980\n the knowledge that we have that would blow people's minds\n\n2:50:53.980 --> 2:50:55.620\n even from 100 years ago.\n\n2:50:55.620 --> 2:50:58.660\n Yeah, and we've even allegedly got out to space\n\n2:50:58.660 --> 2:51:01.220\n and landed on the moon, although I still haven't,\n\n2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:04.340\n I have not seen evidence of the Earth being round,\n\n2:51:04.340 --> 2:51:06.560\n but I'm keeping an open mind.\n\n2:51:08.140 --> 2:51:10.380\n Speaking of which, you studied physics\n\n2:51:10.380 --> 2:51:15.380\n and astrophysics, just to go to that,\n\n2:51:16.860 --> 2:51:20.940\n just to jump around through the fascinating life you've had,\n\n2:51:20.940 --> 2:51:23.620\n when did you, how did that come to be?\n\n2:51:23.620 --> 2:51:25.860\n Like, when did you fall in love with astronomy\n\n2:51:25.860 --> 2:51:28.580\n and space and things like this?\n\n2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:30.460\n As early as I can remember.\n\n2:51:30.460 --> 2:51:33.380\n I was very lucky that my mom, and my dad,\n\n2:51:33.380 --> 2:51:38.300\n but particularly my mom, my mom is like the most nature,\n\n2:51:38.300 --> 2:51:41.220\n she is Mother Earth, is the only way to describe her.\n\n2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:44.540\n Just, she's like Dr. Doolittle, animals flock to her\n\n2:51:44.540 --> 2:51:47.100\n and just like sit and look at her adoringly.\n\n2:51:47.100 --> 2:51:48.380\n As she sings.\n\n2:51:48.380 --> 2:51:51.060\n Yeah, she just is Mother Earth,\n\n2:51:51.060 --> 2:51:53.500\n and she has always been fascinated by,\n\n2:51:54.540 --> 2:51:57.100\n she doesn't have any, she never went to university\n\n2:51:57.100 --> 2:51:59.380\n or anything like that, she's actually phobic of maths,\n\n2:51:59.380 --> 2:52:00.860\n if I try and get her to like,\n\n2:52:00.860 --> 2:52:03.860\n you know, I was trying to teach her poker and she hated it.\n\n2:52:03.860 --> 2:52:06.840\n But she's so deeply curious,\n\n2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:09.880\n and that just got instilled in me when, you know,\n\n2:52:09.880 --> 2:52:11.200\n we would sleep out under the stars,\n\n2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:13.160\n whenever it was, you know, the two nights a year\n\n2:52:13.160 --> 2:52:15.760\n when it was warm enough in the UK to do that.\n\n2:52:15.760 --> 2:52:18.680\n And we would just lie out there until we fell asleep,\n\n2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:20.920\n looking at, looking for satellites,\n\n2:52:20.920 --> 2:52:24.320\n looking for shooting stars, and I was just always,\n\n2:52:24.320 --> 2:52:25.320\n I don't know whether it was from that,\n\n2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:30.320\n but I've always naturally gravitated to like the biggest,\n\n2:52:30.440 --> 2:52:31.960\n the biggest questions.\n\n2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:35.520\n And also the like, the most layers of abstraction I love,\n\n2:52:35.520 --> 2:52:36.720\n just like, what's the meta question?\n\n2:52:36.720 --> 2:52:38.800\n What's the meta question and so on.\n\n2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:40.800\n So I think it just came from that really.\n\n2:52:40.800 --> 2:52:43.760\n And then on top of that, like physics,\n\n2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:45.880\n you know, it also made logical sense\n\n2:52:45.880 --> 2:52:50.880\n in that it was a degree that,\n\n2:52:51.240 --> 2:52:53.800\n well, a subject that ticks the box of being,\n\n2:52:53.800 --> 2:52:55.520\n you know, answering these really big picture questions,\n\n2:52:55.520 --> 2:52:57.840\n but it was also extremely useful.\n\n2:52:57.840 --> 2:53:00.920\n It like has a very high utility in terms of,\n\n2:53:00.920 --> 2:53:02.080\n I didn't know necessarily,\n\n2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:04.400\n I thought I was gonna become like a research scientist.\n\n2:53:04.400 --> 2:53:05.240\n My original plan was,\n\n2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:07.040\n I wanna be a professional astronomer.\n\n2:53:07.040 --> 2:53:08.640\n So it's not just like a philosophy degree\n\n2:53:08.640 --> 2:53:10.400\n that asks the big questions,\n\n2:53:10.400 --> 2:53:14.440\n and it's not like biology and the path\n\n2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:16.160\n to go to medical school or something like that,\n\n2:53:16.160 --> 2:53:19.200\n which is all overly pragmatic, not overly,\n\n2:53:19.200 --> 2:53:23.760\n is very pragmatic, but this is, yeah,\n\n2:53:23.760 --> 2:53:26.480\n physics is a good combination of the two.\n\n2:53:26.480 --> 2:53:27.920\n Yeah, at least for me, it made sense.\n\n2:53:27.920 --> 2:53:30.160\n And I was good at it, I liked it.\n\n2:53:30.160 --> 2:53:32.440\n Yeah, I mean, it wasn't like I did an immense amount\n\n2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:34.320\n of soul searching to choose it or anything.\n\n2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:38.160\n It just was like this, it made the most sense.\n\n2:53:38.160 --> 2:53:41.240\n I mean, you have to make this decision in the UK age 17,\n\n2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:43.640\n which is crazy, because, you know, in US,\n\n2:53:43.640 --> 2:53:46.240\n you go the first year, you do a bunch of stuff, right?\n\n2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:48.520\n And then you choose your major.\n\n2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:50.000\n Yeah, I think the first few years of college,\n\n2:53:50.000 --> 2:53:53.080\n you focus on the drugs and only as you get closer\n\n2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:56.360\n to the end, do you start to think, oh shit,\n\n2:53:56.360 --> 2:53:57.440\n this wasn't about that.\n\n2:53:57.440 --> 2:54:01.380\n And I owe the government a lot of money.\n\n2:54:01.380 --> 2:54:05.180\n How many alien civilizations are out there?\n\n2:54:05.180 --> 2:54:07.580\n When you looked up at the stars with your mom\n\n2:54:07.580 --> 2:54:11.820\n and you were counting them, what's your mom think\n\n2:54:11.820 --> 2:54:13.980\n about the number of alien civilizations?\n\n2:54:13.980 --> 2:54:15.780\n I actually don't know.\n\n2:54:15.780 --> 2:54:18.500\n I would imagine she would take the viewpoint of,\n\n2:54:18.500 --> 2:54:21.300\n you know, she's pretty humble and she knows how many,\n\n2:54:21.300 --> 2:54:24.100\n she knows there's a huge number of potential spawn sites\n\n2:54:24.100 --> 2:54:25.380\n out there, so she would.\n\n2:54:25.380 --> 2:54:26.220\n Spawn sites?\n\n2:54:26.220 --> 2:54:27.540\n Spawn sites, yeah.\n\n2:54:27.540 --> 2:54:29.500\n You know, this is all spawn sites.\n\n2:54:29.500 --> 2:54:30.780\n Yeah, spawn sites in Polytopia.\n\n2:54:30.780 --> 2:54:33.020\n We spawned on Earth, you know, it's.\n\n2:54:33.020 --> 2:54:35.860\n Hmm, yeah, spawn sites.\n\n2:54:35.860 --> 2:54:39.260\n Why does that feel weird to say spawn?\n\n2:54:39.260 --> 2:54:44.260\n Because it makes me feel like there's only one source\n\n2:54:44.860 --> 2:54:47.420\n of life and it's spawning in different locations.\n\n2:54:47.420 --> 2:54:49.220\n That's why the word spawn.\n\n2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:52.580\n Because it feels like life that originated on Earth\n\n2:54:52.580 --> 2:54:54.700\n really originated here.\n\n2:54:54.700 --> 2:54:58.780\n Right, it is unique to this particular.\n\n2:54:58.780 --> 2:55:02.600\n Yeah, I mean, but I don't, in my mind, it doesn't exclude,\n\n2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:04.380\n you know, the completely different forms of life\n\n2:55:04.380 --> 2:55:09.160\n and different biochemical soups can't also spawn,\n\n2:55:09.160 --> 2:55:12.580\n but I guess it implies that there's some spark\n\n2:55:12.580 --> 2:55:16.180\n that is uniform, which I kind of like the idea of.\n\n2:55:16.180 --> 2:55:19.220\n And then I get to think about respawning,\n\n2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:23.500\n like after it dies, like what happens if life on Earth ends?\n\n2:55:23.500 --> 2:55:26.140\n Is it gonna restart again?\n\n2:55:26.140 --> 2:55:28.060\n Probably not, it depends.\n\n2:55:28.060 --> 2:55:28.900\n Maybe Earth is too.\n\n2:55:28.900 --> 2:55:30.460\n It depends on the type of, you know,\n\n2:55:30.460 --> 2:55:32.820\n what's the thing that kills it off, right?\n\n2:55:32.820 --> 2:55:36.100\n If it's a paperclip maximizer, not for the example,\n\n2:55:36.100 --> 2:55:39.640\n but, you know, some kind of very self replicating,\n\n2:55:40.820 --> 2:55:44.380\n high on the capabilities, very low on the wisdom type thing.\n\n2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:47.420\n So whether that's, you know, gray goo, green goo,\n\n2:55:47.420 --> 2:55:51.180\n you know, like nanobots or just a shitty misaligned AI\n\n2:55:51.180 --> 2:55:54.360\n that thinks it needs to turn everything into paperclips.\n\n2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:57.680\n You know, if it's something like that,\n\n2:55:57.680 --> 2:55:59.040\n then it's gonna be very hard for life,\n\n2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:02.080\n you know, complex life, because by definition,\n\n2:56:02.080 --> 2:56:03.160\n you know, a paperclip maximizer\n\n2:56:03.160 --> 2:56:05.680\n is the ultimate instantiation of molecule.\n\n2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:08.620\n Deeply low complexity, over optimization on a single thing,\n\n2:56:08.620 --> 2:56:11.120\n sacrificing everything else, turning the whole world into.\n\n2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:12.200\n Although something tells me,\n\n2:56:12.200 --> 2:56:14.640\n like if we actually take a paperclip maximizer,\n\n2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:16.180\n it destroys everything.\n\n2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:19.200\n It's a really dumb system that just envelops\n\n2:56:19.200 --> 2:56:20.760\n the whole of Earth.\n\n2:56:20.760 --> 2:56:22.360\n And the universe beyond, yeah.\n\n2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:26.600\n Oh, I didn't know that part, but okay, great.\n\n2:56:26.600 --> 2:56:27.440\n That's the thought experiment.\n\n2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:30.280\n So it becomes a multi planetary paperclip maximizer?\n\n2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:31.760\n Well, it just propagates.\n\n2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:33.640\n I mean, it depends whether it figures out\n\n2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:35.040\n how to jump the vacuum gap.\n\n2:56:36.720 --> 2:56:38.640\n But again, I mean, this is all silly\n\n2:56:38.640 --> 2:56:40.280\n because it's a hypothetical thought experiment,\n\n2:56:40.280 --> 2:56:41.200\n which I think doesn't actually have\n\n2:56:41.200 --> 2:56:43.240\n much practical application to the AI safety problem,\n\n2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:45.240\n but it's just a fun thing to play around with.\n\n2:56:45.240 --> 2:56:47.780\n But if by definition, it is maximally intelligent,\n\n2:56:47.780 --> 2:56:50.200\n which means it is maximally good at\n\n2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:53.080\n navigating the environment around it\n\n2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:54.720\n in order to achieve its goal,\n\n2:56:54.720 --> 2:56:58.000\n but extremely bad at choosing goals in the first place.\n\n2:56:58.000 --> 2:57:00.000\n So again, we're talking on this orthogonality thing, right?\n\n2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:03.720\n It's very low on wisdom, but very high on capability.\n\n2:57:03.720 --> 2:57:05.680\n Then it will figure out how to jump the vacuum gap\n\n2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:07.400\n between planets and stars and so on,\n\n2:57:07.400 --> 2:57:09.900\n and thus just turn every atom it gets its hands on\n\n2:57:09.900 --> 2:57:10.960\n into paperclips.\n\n2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:12.800\n Yeah, by the way, for people who don't.\n\n2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:14.600\n Which is maximum virality, by the way.\n\n2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:16.240\n That's what virality is.\n\n2:57:16.240 --> 2:57:18.540\n But does not mean that virality is necessarily\n\n2:57:18.540 --> 2:57:20.040\n all about maximizing paperclips.\n\n2:57:20.040 --> 2:57:21.080\n In that case, it is.\n\n2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:22.280\n So for people who don't know,\n\n2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:24.280\n this is just a thought experiment example\n\n2:57:24.280 --> 2:57:27.360\n of an AI system that's very, that has a goal\n\n2:57:27.360 --> 2:57:30.400\n and is willing to do anything to accomplish that goal,\n\n2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:32.280\n including destroying all life on Earth\n\n2:57:32.280 --> 2:57:36.320\n and all human life and all of consciousness in the universe\n\n2:57:36.320 --> 2:57:40.720\n for the goal of producing a maximum number of paperclips.\n\n2:57:40.720 --> 2:57:41.560\n Okay.\n\n2:57:41.560 --> 2:57:43.960\n Or whatever its optimization function was\n\n2:57:43.960 --> 2:57:45.000\n that it was set at.\n\n2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:45.840\n But don't you think?\n\n2:57:45.840 --> 2:57:47.920\n It could be making, recreating Lexus.\n\n2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:50.600\n Maybe it'll tile the universe in Lex.\n\n2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:51.640\n Go on.\n\n2:57:51.640 --> 2:57:52.480\n I like this idea.\n\n2:57:52.480 --> 2:57:53.320\n No, I'm just kidding.\n\n2:57:53.320 --> 2:57:54.800\n That's better.\n\n2:57:54.800 --> 2:57:56.240\n That's more interesting than paperclips.\n\n2:57:56.240 --> 2:57:57.680\n That could be infinitely optimal\n\n2:57:57.680 --> 2:57:58.520\n if I were to say it to myself.\n\n2:57:58.520 --> 2:58:00.400\n But if you ask me, it's still a bad thing\n\n2:58:00.400 --> 2:58:02.780\n because it's permanently capping\n\n2:58:02.780 --> 2:58:04.200\n what the universe could ever be.\n\n2:58:04.200 --> 2:58:05.880\n It's like, that's its end state.\n\n2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:07.840\n Or achieving the optimal\n\n2:58:07.840 --> 2:58:09.240\n that the universe could ever achieve.\n\n2:58:09.240 --> 2:58:10.320\n But that's up to,\n\n2:58:10.320 --> 2:58:12.480\n different people have different perspectives.\n\n2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:15.520\n But don't you think within the paperclip world\n\n2:58:15.520 --> 2:58:19.320\n that would emerge, just like in the zeros and ones\n\n2:58:19.320 --> 2:58:20.200\n that make up a computer,\n\n2:58:20.200 --> 2:58:22.880\n that would emerge beautiful complexities?\n\n2:58:23.760 --> 2:58:27.820\n Like, it won't suppress, you know,\n\n2:58:27.820 --> 2:58:30.500\n as you scale to multiple planets and throughout,\n\n2:58:30.500 --> 2:58:33.280\n there'll emerge these little worlds\n\n2:58:33.280 --> 2:58:38.140\n that on top of the fabric of maximizing paperclips,\n\n2:58:38.140 --> 2:58:42.880\n there will be, that would emerge like little societies\n\n2:58:42.880 --> 2:58:45.880\n of paperclip.\n\n2:58:45.880 --> 2:58:47.520\n Well, then we're not describing\n\n2:58:47.520 --> 2:58:48.600\n a paperclip maximizer anymore.\n\n2:58:48.600 --> 2:58:51.600\n Because by the, like, if you think of what a paperclip is,\n\n2:58:51.600 --> 2:58:55.600\n it is literally just a piece of bent iron, right?\n\n2:58:55.600 --> 2:58:58.960\n So if it's maximizing that throughout the universe,\n\n2:58:58.960 --> 2:59:01.040\n it's taking every atom it gets its hand on\n\n2:59:01.040 --> 2:59:04.240\n into somehow turning it into iron or steel.\n\n2:59:04.240 --> 2:59:05.400\n And then bending it into that shape\n\n2:59:05.400 --> 2:59:06.800\n and then done and done.\n\n2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:08.880\n By definition, like paperclips,\n\n2:59:08.880 --> 2:59:11.960\n there is no way for, well, okay.\n\n2:59:11.960 --> 2:59:13.920\n So you're saying that paperclips somehow\n\n2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:17.960\n will just emerge and create through gravity or something.\n\n2:59:17.960 --> 2:59:18.800\n Well, no, no, no.\n\n2:59:18.800 --> 2:59:21.600\n Because there's a dynamic element to the whole system.\n\n2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:24.720\n It's not just, it's creating those paperclips\n\n2:59:24.720 --> 2:59:27.900\n and the act of creating, there's going to be a process.\n\n2:59:27.900 --> 2:59:30.640\n And that process will have a dance to it.\n\n2:59:30.640 --> 2:59:32.640\n Because it's not like sequential thing.\n\n2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:35.240\n There's a whole complex three dimensional system\n\n2:59:35.240 --> 2:59:37.760\n of paperclips, you know, like, you know,\n\n2:59:37.760 --> 2:59:39.400\n people like string theory, right?\n\n2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:40.920\n It's supposed to be strings that are interacting\n\n2:59:40.920 --> 2:59:41.960\n in fascinating ways.\n\n2:59:41.960 --> 2:59:44.520\n I'm sure paperclips are very string like,\n\n2:59:44.520 --> 2:59:46.520\n they can be interacting in very interesting ways\n\n2:59:46.520 --> 2:59:50.040\n as you scale exponentially through three dimensional.\n\n2:59:50.040 --> 2:59:53.840\n I mean, I'm sure the paperclip maximizer\n\n2:59:53.840 --> 2:59:55.680\n has to come up with a theory of everything.\n\n2:59:55.680 --> 2:59:58.320\n It has to create like wormholes, right?\n\n2:59:58.320 --> 3:00:01.040\n It has to break, like,\n\n3:00:01.040 --> 3:00:02.680\n it has to understand quantum mechanics.\n\n3:00:02.680 --> 3:00:03.520\n It has to understand general relativity.\n\n3:00:03.520 --> 3:00:04.840\n I love your optimism.\n\n3:00:04.840 --> 3:00:06.240\n This is where I'd say this,\n\n3:00:06.240 --> 3:00:08.400\n we're going into the realm of pathological optimism\n\n3:00:08.400 --> 3:00:09.360\n where if I, it's.\n\n3:00:09.360 --> 3:00:12.800\n I'm sure there'll be a,\n\n3:00:12.800 --> 3:00:14.880\n I think there's an intelligence\n\n3:00:14.880 --> 3:00:16.320\n that emerges from that system.\n\n3:00:16.320 --> 3:00:18.480\n So you're saying that basically intelligence\n\n3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:21.680\n is inherent in the fabric of reality and will find a way.\n\n3:00:21.680 --> 3:00:23.880\n Kind of like Goldblum says, life will find a way.\n\n3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:25.240\n You think life will find a way\n\n3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:29.520\n even out of this perfectly homogenous dead soup.\n\n3:00:29.520 --> 3:00:31.600\n It's not perfectly homogenous.\n\n3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:34.960\n It has to, it's perfectly maximal in the production.\n\n3:00:34.960 --> 3:00:37.400\n I don't know why people keep thinking it's homogenous.\n\n3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:39.560\n It maximizes the number of paperclips.\n\n3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:40.400\n That's the only thing.\n\n3:00:40.400 --> 3:00:42.040\n It's not trying to be homogenous.\n\n3:00:42.040 --> 3:00:42.880\n It's trying.\n\n3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:44.760\n It's trying to maximize paperclips.\n\n3:00:44.760 --> 3:00:47.840\n So you're saying, you're saying that because it,\n\n3:00:47.840 --> 3:00:50.160\n because, you know, kind of like in the Big Bang\n\n3:00:50.160 --> 3:00:52.200\n or, you know, it seems like, you know, things,\n\n3:00:52.200 --> 3:00:54.880\n there were clusters, there was more stuff here than there.\n\n3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:56.600\n That was enough of the patternicity\n\n3:00:56.600 --> 3:00:58.440\n that kickstarted the evolutionary process.\n\n3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:01.280\n It's the little weirdness that will make it beautiful.\n\n3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:02.120\n So yeah.\n\n3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:03.000\n Complexity emerges.\n\n3:01:03.000 --> 3:01:04.200\n Interesting, okay.\n\n3:01:04.200 --> 3:01:05.600\n Well, so how does that line up then\n\n3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:08.080\n with the whole heat death of the universe, right?\n\n3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:10.080\n Cause that's another sort of instantiation of this.\n\n3:01:10.080 --> 3:01:13.200\n It's like everything becomes so far apart and so cold\n\n3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:18.200\n and so perfectly mixed that it's like homogenous grayness.\n\n3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:23.280\n Do you think that even out of that homogenous grayness\n\n3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:26.880\n where there's no, you know, negative entropy,\n\n3:01:26.880 --> 3:01:30.880\n that, you know, there's no free energy that we understand\n\n3:01:30.880 --> 3:01:33.920\n even from that new stuff?\n\n3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:36.560\n Yeah, the paperclip maximizer\n\n3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:38.120\n or any other intelligence systems\n\n3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:40.960\n will figure out ways to travel to other universes\n\n3:01:40.960 --> 3:01:43.480\n to create Big Bangs within those universes\n\n3:01:43.480 --> 3:01:46.120\n or through black holes to create whole other worlds\n\n3:01:46.120 --> 3:01:49.840\n to break the, what we consider are the limitations\n\n3:01:49.840 --> 3:01:50.680\n of physics.\n\n3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:56.640\n The paperclip maximizer will find a way if a way exists.\n\n3:01:56.640 --> 3:01:59.000\n And we should be humbled to realize that we don't.\n\n3:01:59.000 --> 3:02:01.440\n Yeah, but because it just wants to make more paperclips.\n\n3:02:01.440 --> 3:02:02.640\n So it's gonna go into those universes\n\n3:02:02.640 --> 3:02:03.760\n and turn them into paperclips.\n\n3:02:03.760 --> 3:02:07.480\n Yeah, but we humans, not humans,\n\n3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:10.320\n but complex system exists on top of that.\n\n3:02:10.320 --> 3:02:11.880\n We're not interfering with it.\n\n3:02:13.000 --> 3:02:17.360\n This complexity emerges from the simple base state.\n\n3:02:17.360 --> 3:02:18.280\n The simple base.\n\n3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:20.280\n Whether it's, yeah, whether it's, you know,\n\n3:02:20.280 --> 3:02:22.640\n plank lengths or paperclips as the base unit.\n\n3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:25.720\n Yeah, you can think of like the universe\n\n3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:28.920\n as a paperclip maximizer because it's doing some dumb stuff.\n\n3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:31.320\n Like physics seems to be pretty dumb.\n\n3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:34.120\n It has, like, I don't know if you can summarize it.\n\n3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:37.360\n Yeah, the laws are fairly basic\n\n3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:39.640\n and yet out of them amazing complexity emerges.\n\n3:02:39.640 --> 3:02:43.440\n And its goals seem to be pretty basic and dumb.\n\n3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:45.280\n If you can summarize its goals,\n\n3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:47.600\n I mean, I don't know what's a nice way maybe,\n\n3:02:49.480 --> 3:02:52.400\n maybe laws of thermodynamics could be good.\n\n3:02:52.400 --> 3:02:55.080\n I don't know if you can assign goals to physics,\n\n3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:57.960\n but if you formulate in the sense of goals,\n\n3:02:57.960 --> 3:03:00.840\n it's very similar to paperclip maximizing\n\n3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:02.960\n in the dumbness of the goals.\n\n3:03:02.960 --> 3:03:06.520\n But the pockets of complexity as it emerge\n\n3:03:06.520 --> 3:03:07.960\n is where beauty emerges.\n\n3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:09.120\n That's where life emerges.\n\n3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:12.120\n That's where intelligence, that's where humans emerge.\n\n3:03:12.120 --> 3:03:14.000\n And I think we're being very down\n\n3:03:14.000 --> 3:03:16.240\n on this whole paperclip maximizer thing.\n\n3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:17.680\n Now, the reason we hated it.\n\n3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:19.000\n I think, yeah, because what you're saying\n\n3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:24.000\n is that you think that the force of emergence itself\n\n3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:27.480\n is another like unwritten, not unwritten,\n\n3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:31.800\n but like another baked in law of reality.\n\n3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:35.200\n And you're trusting that emergence will find a way to,\n\n3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:38.720\n even out of seemingly the most mollusky,\n\n3:03:38.720 --> 3:03:42.200\n awful, plain outcome, emergence will still find a way.\n\n3:03:42.200 --> 3:03:43.440\n I love that as a philosophy.\n\n3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:44.320\n I think it's very nice.\n\n3:03:44.320 --> 3:03:47.280\n I would wield it carefully\n\n3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:50.440\n because there's large error bars on that\n\n3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:52.040\n and the certainty of that.\n\n3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:55.920\n How about we build the paperclip maximizer and find out.\n\n3:03:55.920 --> 3:03:56.840\n Classic, yeah.\n\n3:03:56.840 --> 3:03:59.120\n Moloch is doing cartwheels, man.\n\n3:03:59.120 --> 3:03:59.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:02.440\n But the thing is it will destroy humans in the process,\n\n3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:05.320\n which is the reason we really don't like it.\n\n3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:07.240\n We seem to be really holding on\n\n3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:10.240\n to this whole human civilization thing.\n\n3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:13.840\n Would that make you sad if AI systems that are beautiful,\n\n3:04:13.840 --> 3:04:15.680\n that are conscious, that are interesting\n\n3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:17.320\n and complex and intelligent,\n\n3:04:18.160 --> 3:04:20.040\n ultimately lead to the death of humans?\n\n3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:21.080\n Would that make you sad?\n\n3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:23.000\n If humans led to the death of humans?\n\n3:04:23.000 --> 3:04:23.840\n Sorry.\n\n3:04:23.840 --> 3:04:25.520\n Like if they would supersede humans.\n\n3:04:25.520 --> 3:04:26.840\n Oh, if some AI?\n\n3:04:26.840 --> 3:04:30.320\n Yeah, AI would end humans.\n\n3:04:30.320 --> 3:04:32.560\n I mean, that's the reason why I'm like,\n\n3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:36.440\n in some ways less emotionally concerned about AI risk\n\n3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:39.480\n than say, bio risk.\n\n3:04:39.480 --> 3:04:42.200\n Because at least with AI, there's a chance,\n\n3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:44.120\n you know, if we're in this hypothetical\n\n3:04:44.120 --> 3:04:45.640\n where it wipes out humans,\n\n3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:48.240\n but it does it for some like higher purpose,\n\n3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:51.040\n it needs our atoms and energy to do something.\n\n3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:53.120\n At least now the universe is going on\n\n3:04:53.120 --> 3:04:55.240\n to do something interesting,\n\n3:04:55.240 --> 3:04:56.760\n whereas if it wipes everything, you know,\n\n3:04:56.760 --> 3:05:00.120\n bio like just kills everything on earth and that's it.\n\n3:05:00.120 --> 3:05:01.440\n And there's no more, you know,\n\n3:05:01.440 --> 3:05:03.320\n earth cannot spawn anything more meaningful\n\n3:05:03.320 --> 3:05:05.960\n in the few hundred million years it has left,\n\n3:05:05.960 --> 3:05:07.720\n because it doesn't have much time left.\n\n3:05:09.040 --> 3:05:13.480\n Then, yeah, I don't know.\n\n3:05:13.480 --> 3:05:16.120\n So one of my favorite books I've ever read is,\n\n3:05:16.120 --> 3:05:19.920\n Novocene by James Lovelock, who sadly just died.\n\n3:05:19.920 --> 3:05:22.080\n He wrote it when he was like 99.\n\n3:05:22.080 --> 3:05:25.560\n He died aged 102, so it's a fairly new book.\n\n3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:27.000\n And he sort of talks about that,\n\n3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:29.240\n that he thinks it's, you know,\n\n3:05:29.240 --> 3:05:30.800\n sort of building off this Gaia theory\n\n3:05:30.800 --> 3:05:32.920\n where like earth is like living,\n\n3:05:34.320 --> 3:05:36.080\n some form of intelligence itself,\n\n3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:38.360\n and that this is the next like step, right?\n\n3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:41.720\n Is this, whatever this new intelligence\n\n3:05:41.720 --> 3:05:43.360\n that is maybe silicon based\n\n3:05:43.360 --> 3:05:46.120\n as opposed to carbon based goes on to do.\n\n3:05:46.120 --> 3:05:48.280\n And it's a really sort of, in some ways an optimistic,\n\n3:05:48.280 --> 3:05:49.800\n but really fatalistic book.\n\n3:05:49.800 --> 3:05:52.400\n And I don't know if I fully subscribed to it,\n\n3:05:52.400 --> 3:05:54.400\n but it's a beautiful piece to read anyway.\n\n3:05:54.400 --> 3:05:56.760\n So am I sad by that idea?\n\n3:05:56.760 --> 3:05:57.920\n I think so, yes.\n\n3:05:57.920 --> 3:05:59.240\n And actually, yeah, this is the reason\n\n3:05:59.240 --> 3:06:00.120\n why I'm sad by the idea,\n\n3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:02.520\n because if something is truly brilliant\n\n3:06:02.520 --> 3:06:05.600\n and wise and smart and truly super intelligent,\n\n3:06:06.440 --> 3:06:09.320\n it should be able to figure out abundance.\n\n3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:11.720\n So if it figures out abundance,\n\n3:06:11.720 --> 3:06:12.800\n it shouldn't need to kill us off.\n\n3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:14.360\n It should be able to find a way for us.\n\n3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:17.440\n It should be, there's plenty, the universe is huge.\n\n3:06:17.440 --> 3:06:19.920\n There should be plenty of space for it to go out\n\n3:06:19.920 --> 3:06:21.760\n and do all the things it wants to do,\n\n3:06:21.760 --> 3:06:23.440\n and like give us a little pocket\n\n3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:24.880\n where we can continue doing our things\n\n3:06:24.880 --> 3:06:27.400\n and we can continue to do things and so on.\n\n3:06:27.400 --> 3:06:28.920\n And again, if it's so supremely wise,\n\n3:06:28.920 --> 3:06:29.760\n it shouldn't even be worried\n\n3:06:29.760 --> 3:06:31.920\n about the game theoretic considerations\n\n3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:33.000\n that by leaving us alive,\n\n3:06:33.000 --> 3:06:35.120\n we'll then go and create another like super intelligent agent\n\n3:06:35.120 --> 3:06:36.600\n that it then has to compete against,\n\n3:06:36.600 --> 3:06:38.280\n because it should be only wise and smart enough\n\n3:06:38.280 --> 3:06:40.680\n to not have to concern itself with that.\n\n3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:44.680\n Unless it deems humans to be kind of assholes.\n\n3:06:44.680 --> 3:06:48.680\n Like the humans are a source of non\n\n3:06:48.680 --> 3:06:50.880\n of a lose, lose kind of dynamics.\n\n3:06:51.880 --> 3:06:55.440\n Well, yes and no, we're not,\n\n3:06:55.440 --> 3:06:57.600\n Moloch is, that's why I think it's important to separate.\n\n3:06:57.600 --> 3:07:00.200\n But maybe humans are the source of Moloch.\n\n3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:02.600\n No, I think, I mean, I think game theory\n\n3:07:02.600 --> 3:07:03.800\n is the source of Moloch.\n\n3:07:03.800 --> 3:07:05.560\n And, you know, because Moloch exists\n\n3:07:05.560 --> 3:07:08.000\n in nonhuman systems as well.\n\n3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:10.560\n It happens within like agents within a game\n\n3:07:10.560 --> 3:07:13.920\n in terms of like, you know, it applies to agents,\n\n3:07:13.920 --> 3:07:15.640\n but like it can apply to, you know,\n\n3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:20.640\n a species that's on an island of animals,\n\n3:07:20.640 --> 3:07:22.680\n you know, rats out competing,\n\n3:07:22.680 --> 3:07:25.520\n the ones that like massively consume all the resources\n\n3:07:25.520 --> 3:07:26.840\n are the ones that are gonna win out\n\n3:07:26.840 --> 3:07:29.680\n over the more like chill, socialized ones.\n\n3:07:29.680 --> 3:07:31.520\n And so, you know, creates this Malthusian trap,\n\n3:07:31.520 --> 3:07:34.480\n like Moloch exists in little pockets in nature as well.\n\n3:07:34.480 --> 3:07:35.960\n So it's not a strictly human thing.\n\n3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:38.320\n I wonder if it's actually a result of consequences\n\n3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:41.520\n of the invention of predator and prey dynamics.\n\n3:07:41.520 --> 3:07:45.240\n Maybe it needs to, AI will have to kill off\n\n3:07:45.240 --> 3:07:47.840\n every organism that's.\n\n3:07:47.840 --> 3:07:50.240\n Now you're talking about killing off competition.\n\n3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:55.240\n Not competition, but just like the way,\n\n3:07:55.880 --> 3:07:59.960\n it's like the weeds or whatever\n\n3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:01.640\n in a beautiful flower garden.\n\n3:08:01.640 --> 3:08:02.480\n Parasites.\n\n3:08:02.480 --> 3:08:05.200\n The parasites, yeah, on the whole system.\n\n3:08:05.200 --> 3:08:08.440\n Now, of course, it won't do that completely.\n\n3:08:08.440 --> 3:08:10.520\n It'll put them in a zoo like we do with parasites.\n\n3:08:10.520 --> 3:08:11.360\n It'll ring fence.\n\n3:08:11.360 --> 3:08:13.120\n Yeah, and there'll be somebody doing a PhD\n\n3:08:13.120 --> 3:08:15.800\n on like they'll prod humans with a stick\n\n3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:16.840\n and see what they do.\n\n3:08:18.880 --> 3:08:22.400\n But I mean, in terms of letting us run wild\n\n3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:25.080\n outside of the, you know, a geographically\n\n3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:26.840\n constrained region that might be,\n\n3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:31.200\n that it might decide to against that.\n\n3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:33.160\n No, I think there's obviously the capacity\n\n3:08:33.160 --> 3:08:38.160\n for beauty and kindness and non Moloch behavior\n\n3:08:38.160 --> 3:08:41.440\n amidst humans, so I'm pretty sure AI will preserve us.\n\n3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:46.240\n Let me, I don't know if you answered the aliens question.\n\n3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:47.080\n No, I didn't.\n\n3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:49.600\n You had a good conversation with Toby Orr.\n\n3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:50.440\n Yes.\n\n3:08:50.440 --> 3:08:52.200\n About various sides of the universe.\n\n3:08:52.200 --> 3:08:54.680\n I think, did he say, now I'm forgetting,\n\n3:08:54.680 --> 3:08:58.160\n but I think he said it's a good chance we're alone.\n\n3:08:58.160 --> 3:09:02.200\n So the classic, you know, Fermi paradox question is,\n\n3:09:02.200 --> 3:09:07.200\n there are so many spawn points and yet, you know,\n\n3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:12.080\n it didn't take us that long to go from harnessing fire\n\n3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:15.120\n to sending out radio signals into space.\n\n3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:18.640\n So surely given the vastness of space we should be,\n\n3:09:18.640 --> 3:09:20.720\n and you know, even if only a tiny fraction of those\n\n3:09:20.720 --> 3:09:23.120\n create life and other civilizations too,\n\n3:09:23.120 --> 3:09:24.840\n we should be, the universe should be very noisy.\n\n3:09:24.840 --> 3:09:27.800\n There should be evidence of Dyson spheres or whatever,\n\n3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:29.680\n you know, like at least radio signals and so on,\n\n3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:32.520\n but seemingly things are very silent out there.\n\n3:09:32.520 --> 3:09:33.800\n Now, of course, it depends on who you speak to.\n\n3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:35.840\n Some people say that they're getting signals all the time\n\n3:09:35.840 --> 3:09:37.480\n and so on and like, I don't wanna make\n\n3:09:37.480 --> 3:09:38.640\n an epistemic statement on that,\n\n3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:43.120\n but it seems like there's a lot of silence.\n\n3:09:43.120 --> 3:09:45.680\n And so that raises this paradox.\n\n3:09:45.680 --> 3:09:50.680\n And then say, you know, the Drake equation.\n\n3:09:51.040 --> 3:09:55.120\n So the Drake equation is like basically just a simple thing\n\n3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:57.720\n of like trying to estimate the number of possible\n\n3:09:57.720 --> 3:09:58.960\n civilizations within the galaxy\n\n3:09:58.960 --> 3:10:02.080\n by multiplying the number of stars created per year\n\n3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:03.560\n by the number of stars that have planets,\n\n3:10:03.560 --> 3:10:04.760\n planets that are habitable, blah, blah, blah.\n\n3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:06.520\n So all these like different factors.\n\n3:10:06.520 --> 3:10:09.240\n And then you plug in numbers into that and you, you know,\n\n3:10:09.240 --> 3:10:11.400\n depending on like the range of, you know,\n\n3:10:11.400 --> 3:10:14.680\n your lower bound and your upper bound point estimates\n\n3:10:14.680 --> 3:10:16.800\n that you put in, you get out a number at the end\n\n3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:18.520\n for the number of civilizations.\n\n3:10:18.520 --> 3:10:22.840\n But what Toby and his crew did differently was,\n\n3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:25.640\n Toby is a researcher at the Future of Humanity Institute.\n\n3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:30.640\n They, instead of, they realized that it's like basically\n\n3:10:31.160 --> 3:10:33.800\n a statistical quirk that if you put in point sources,\n\n3:10:33.800 --> 3:10:34.840\n even if you think you're putting in\n\n3:10:34.840 --> 3:10:36.000\n conservative point sources,\n\n3:10:36.000 --> 3:10:37.960\n because on some of these variables,\n\n3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:41.080\n the uncertainty is so large,\n\n3:10:41.080 --> 3:10:43.800\n it spans like maybe even like a couple of hundred\n\n3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:45.000\n orders of magnitude.\n\n3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:47.440\n By putting in point sources,\n\n3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:50.880\n it's always going to lead to overestimates.\n\n3:10:50.880 --> 3:10:54.320\n And so they, like by putting stuff on a log scale,\n\n3:10:54.320 --> 3:10:56.080\n or actually they did it on like a log log scale\n\n3:10:56.080 --> 3:10:57.400\n on some of them,\n\n3:10:57.400 --> 3:10:59.960\n and then like ran the simulation across the whole\n\n3:11:01.080 --> 3:11:02.600\n bucket of uncertainty,\n\n3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:04.320\n across all of those orders of magnitude.\n\n3:11:04.320 --> 3:11:05.840\n When you do that,\n\n3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:08.240\n then actually the number comes out much, much smaller.\n\n3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:10.440\n And that's the more statistically rigorous,\n\n3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:11.920\n you know, mathematically correct way\n\n3:11:11.920 --> 3:11:13.360\n of doing the calculation.\n\n3:11:13.360 --> 3:11:14.680\n It's still a lot of hand waving.\n\n3:11:14.680 --> 3:11:17.640\n As science goes, it's like definitely, you know,\n\n3:11:17.640 --> 3:11:19.840\n just waving, I don't know what an analogy is,\n\n3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:22.040\n but it's hand wavy.\n\n3:11:22.040 --> 3:11:24.720\n And anyway, when they did this,\n\n3:11:24.720 --> 3:11:27.000\n and then they did a Bayesian update on it as well,\n\n3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:30.120\n to like factor in the fact that there is no evidence\n\n3:11:30.120 --> 3:11:31.320\n that we're picking up because, you know,\n\n3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:33.920\n no evidence is actually a form of evidence, right?\n\n3:11:33.920 --> 3:11:37.680\n And the long and short of it comes out that the,\n\n3:11:37.680 --> 3:11:41.320\n we're roughly around 70% to be the only\n\n3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:45.080\n intelligent civilization in our galaxy thus far,\n\n3:11:45.080 --> 3:11:47.840\n and around 50, 50 in the entire observable universe,\n\n3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:50.200\n which sounds so crazily counterintuitive,\n\n3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:53.360\n but their math is legit.\n\n3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:55.600\n Well, yeah, the math around this particular equation,\n\n3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:57.760\n which the equation is ridiculous on many levels,\n\n3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:02.760\n but the powerful thing about the equation\n\n3:12:03.160 --> 3:12:05.200\n is there's the different things,\n\n3:12:05.200 --> 3:12:09.400\n different components that can be estimated,\n\n3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:13.800\n and the error bars on which can be reduced with science.\n\n3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:17.320\n And hence throughout, since the equation came out,\n\n3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:19.560\n the error bars have been coming out on different,\n\n3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:20.920\n different aspects.\n\n3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:23.600\n And so that, it almost kind of says,\n\n3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:27.000\n what, like this gives you a mission to reduce the error bars\n\n3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:30.000\n on these estimates over a period of time.\n\n3:12:30.000 --> 3:12:32.760\n And once you do, you can better and better understand,\n\n3:12:32.760 --> 3:12:34.720\n like in the process of redoing the error bars,\n\n3:12:34.720 --> 3:12:36.960\n you'll get to understand actually\n\n3:12:36.960 --> 3:12:41.480\n what is the right way to find out where the aliens are,\n\n3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:43.960\n how many of them there are, and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:47.800\n So I don't think it's good to use that for an estimation.\n\n3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:50.120\n I think you do have to think from like,\n\n3:12:50.120 --> 3:12:51.840\n more like from first principles,\n\n3:12:51.840 --> 3:12:53.880\n just looking at what life is on Earth,\n\n3:12:55.320 --> 3:12:59.320\n and trying to understand the very physics based,\n\n3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:04.240\n biology, chemistry, biology based question of what is life,\n\n3:13:04.240 --> 3:13:05.960\n maybe computation based.\n\n3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.920\n What the fuck is this thing?\n\n3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:12.160\n And that, like how difficult is it to create this thing?\n\n3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:14.520\n It's one way to say like how many planets like this\n\n3:13:14.520 --> 3:13:16.160\n are out there, all that kind of stuff,\n\n3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:20.560\n but it feels like from our very limited knowledge\n\n3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:25.560\n perspective, the right way is to think how does,\n\n3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:28.200\n what is this thing and how does it originate?\n\n3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:32.000\n From very simple nonlife things,\n\n3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:36.240\n how does complex lifelike things emerge?\n\n3:13:37.120 --> 3:13:42.120\n From a rock to a bacteria, protein,\n\n3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:46.400\n and these like weird systems that encode information\n\n3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:49.520\n and pass information from self replicate,\n\n3:13:49.520 --> 3:13:51.560\n and then also select each other and mutate\n\n3:13:51.560 --> 3:13:53.440\n in interesting ways such that they can adapt\n\n3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:56.560\n and evolve and build increasingly more complex systems.\n\n3:13:56.560 --> 3:13:59.720\n Right, well it's a form of information processing, right?\n\n3:13:59.720 --> 3:14:00.560\n Right.\n\n3:14:00.560 --> 3:14:04.000\n Whereas information transfer, but then also\n\n3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.440\n an energy processing, which then results in,\n\n3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:09.080\n I guess information processing,\n\n3:14:09.080 --> 3:14:09.920\n maybe I'm getting bogged down.\n\n3:14:09.920 --> 3:14:12.560\n It's doing some modification and yeah,\n\n3:14:12.560 --> 3:14:14.440\n the input is some energy.\n\n3:14:14.440 --> 3:14:17.600\n Right, it's able to extract, yeah,\n\n3:14:17.600 --> 3:14:20.640\n extract resources from its environment\n\n3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:22.680\n in order to achieve a goal.\n\n3:14:22.680 --> 3:14:24.920\n But the goal doesn't seem to be clear.\n\n3:14:24.920 --> 3:14:29.440\n Right, well the goal is to make more of itself.\n\n3:14:29.440 --> 3:14:33.760\n Yeah, but in a way that increases,\n\n3:14:33.760 --> 3:14:36.320\n I mean I don't know if evolution\n\n3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:39.840\n is a fundamental law of the universe,\n\n3:14:39.840 --> 3:14:44.200\n but it seems to want to replicate itself\n\n3:14:44.200 --> 3:14:47.640\n in a way that maximizes the chance of its survival.\n\n3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:51.320\n Individual agents within an ecosystem do, yes, yes.\n\n3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:53.280\n Evolution itself doesn't give a fuck.\n\n3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:54.120\n Right.\n\n3:14:54.120 --> 3:14:55.200\n It's a very, it don't care.\n\n3:14:55.200 --> 3:14:58.480\n It's just like, oh, you optimize it.\n\n3:14:58.480 --> 3:15:01.520\n Well, at least it's certainly, yeah,\n\n3:15:01.520 --> 3:15:03.440\n it doesn't care about the welfare\n\n3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:05.040\n of the individual agents within it,\n\n3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:06.440\n but it does seem to, I don't know.\n\n3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:09.680\n I think the mistake is that we're anthropomorphizing.\n\n3:15:09.680 --> 3:15:13.440\n To even try and give evolution a mindset\n\n3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:17.200\n because it is, there's a really great post\n\n3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:21.440\n by Eliezer Yudkowsky on Lesrong,\n\n3:15:21.440 --> 3:15:25.360\n which is an alien God.\n\n3:15:25.360 --> 3:15:27.560\n And he talks about the mistake we make\n\n3:15:27.560 --> 3:15:29.160\n when we try and put our mind,\n\n3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:32.280\n think through things from an evolutionary perspective\n\n3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:35.160\n as though giving evolution some kind of agency\n\n3:15:35.160 --> 3:15:36.320\n and what it wants.\n\n3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:39.520\n Yeah, worth reading, but yeah.\n\n3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:42.600\n I would like to say that having interacted\n\n3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:43.960\n with a lot of really smart people\n\n3:15:43.960 --> 3:15:46.920\n that say that anthropomorphization is a mistake,\n\n3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:48.720\n I would like to say that saying\n\n3:15:48.720 --> 3:15:51.600\n that anthropomorphization is a mistake is a mistake.\n\n3:15:51.600 --> 3:15:54.960\n I think there's a lot of power in anthropomorphization,\n\n3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:57.720\n if I can only say that word correctly one time.\n\n3:15:57.720 --> 3:16:00.760\n I think that's actually a really powerful way\n\n3:16:00.760 --> 3:16:01.800\n to reason to things.\n\n3:16:01.800 --> 3:16:04.320\n And I think people, especially people in robotics\n\n3:16:04.320 --> 3:16:07.120\n seem to run away from it as fast as possible.\n\n3:16:07.120 --> 3:16:09.280\n And I just, I think.\n\n3:16:09.280 --> 3:16:12.200\n Can you give an example of like how it helps in robotics?\n\n3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:18.160\n Oh, in that our world is a world of humans\n\n3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:23.320\n and to see robots as fundamentally just tools\n\n3:16:24.200 --> 3:16:27.960\n runs away from the fact that we live in a world,\n\n3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.000\n a dynamic world of humans.\n\n3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:32.080\n That like these, all these game theory systems\n\n3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:35.440\n we've talked about, that a robot\n\n3:16:35.440 --> 3:16:37.560\n that ever has to interact with humans.\n\n3:16:37.560 --> 3:16:40.800\n And I don't mean like intimate friendship interaction.\n\n3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:43.320\n I mean, in a factory setting where it has to deal\n\n3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:45.520\n with the uncertainty of humans, all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:16:45.520 --> 3:16:49.840\n You have to acknowledge that the robot's behavior\n\n3:16:49.840 --> 3:16:53.360\n has an effect on the human, just as much as the human\n\n3:16:53.360 --> 3:16:54.600\n has an effect on the robot.\n\n3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:56.120\n And there's a dance there.\n\n3:16:56.120 --> 3:16:58.400\n And you have to realize that this entity,\n\n3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:01.680\n when a human sees a robot, this is obvious\n\n3:17:01.680 --> 3:17:04.240\n in a physical manifestation of a robot,\n\n3:17:04.240 --> 3:17:05.800\n they feel a certain way.\n\n3:17:05.800 --> 3:17:07.920\n They have a fear, they have uncertainty.\n\n3:17:07.920 --> 3:17:11.880\n They have their own personal life projections.\n\n3:17:11.880 --> 3:17:13.240\n We have to have pets and dogs\n\n3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:14.840\n and the thing looks like a dog.\n\n3:17:14.840 --> 3:17:17.120\n They have their own memories of what a dog is like.\n\n3:17:17.120 --> 3:17:19.760\n They have certain feelings and that's gonna be useful\n\n3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:22.240\n in a safety setting, safety critical setting,\n\n3:17:22.240 --> 3:17:25.280\n which is one of the most trivial settings for a robot\n\n3:17:25.280 --> 3:17:29.240\n in terms of how to avoid any kind of dangerous situations.\n\n3:17:29.240 --> 3:17:32.520\n And a robot should really consider that\n\n3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:34.880\n in navigating its environment.\n\n3:17:34.880 --> 3:17:38.760\n And we humans are right to reason about how a robot\n\n3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:41.480\n should consider navigating its environment\n\n3:17:41.480 --> 3:17:42.840\n through anthropomorphization.\n\n3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:46.520\n I also think our brains are designed to think\n\n3:17:46.520 --> 3:17:51.520\n in human terms, like game theory,\n\n3:17:55.320 --> 3:18:00.320\n I think is best applied in the space of human decisions.\n\n3:18:01.680 --> 3:18:03.440\n And so...\n\n3:18:03.440 --> 3:18:06.160\n Right, you're dealing, I mean, with things like AI,\n\n3:18:06.160 --> 3:18:10.520\n AI is, they are, we can somewhat,\n\n3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:11.960\n like, I don't think it's,\n\n3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:14.160\n the reason I say anthropomorphization\n\n3:18:14.160 --> 3:18:17.000\n we need to be careful with is because there is a danger\n\n3:18:17.000 --> 3:18:20.840\n of overly applying, overly wrongly assuming\n\n3:18:20.840 --> 3:18:24.200\n that this artificial intelligence is going to operate\n\n3:18:24.200 --> 3:18:25.880\n in any similar way to us,\n\n3:18:25.880 --> 3:18:27.760\n because it is operating\n\n3:18:27.760 --> 3:18:29.680\n on a fundamentally different substrate.\n\n3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:33.880\n Like even dogs or even mice or whatever, in some ways,\n\n3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:37.520\n like anthropomorphizing them is less of a mistake, I think,\n\n3:18:37.520 --> 3:18:40.200\n than an AI, even though it's an AI we built and so on,\n\n3:18:40.200 --> 3:18:41.440\n because at least we know\n\n3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:43.360\n that they're running from the same substrate.\n\n3:18:43.360 --> 3:18:45.560\n And they've also evolved from the same,\n\n3:18:45.560 --> 3:18:48.680\n out of the same evolutionary process.\n\n3:18:48.680 --> 3:18:50.000\n They've followed this evolution\n\n3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:52.400\n of like needing to compete for resources\n\n3:18:52.400 --> 3:18:55.200\n and needing to find a mate and that kind of stuff.\n\n3:18:55.200 --> 3:18:58.280\n Whereas an AI that has just popped into existence\n\n3:18:58.280 --> 3:19:00.480\n somewhere on like a cloud server,\n\n3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:02.840\n let's say, you know, or whatever, however it runs\n\n3:19:02.840 --> 3:19:03.920\n and whatever, whether it,\n\n3:19:03.920 --> 3:19:05.560\n I don't know whether they have an internal experience.\n\n3:19:05.560 --> 3:19:07.040\n I don't think they necessarily do.\n\n3:19:07.040 --> 3:19:08.120\n In fact, I don't think they do.\n\n3:19:08.120 --> 3:19:11.920\n But the point is, is that to try and apply\n\n3:19:11.920 --> 3:19:14.880\n any kind of modeling of like thinking through problems\n\n3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:16.920\n and decisions in the same way that we do\n\n3:19:16.920 --> 3:19:19.720\n has to be done extremely carefully because they are,\n\n3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:23.560\n like, they're so alien,\n\n3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:26.320\n their method of whatever their form of thinking is,\n\n3:19:26.320 --> 3:19:29.160\n it's just so different because they've never had to evolve,\n\n3:19:29.160 --> 3:19:30.640\n you know, in the same way.\n\n3:19:30.640 --> 3:19:32.280\n Yeah, beautifully put.\n\n3:19:32.280 --> 3:19:33.760\n I was just playing devil's advocate.\n\n3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:35.680\n I do think in certain contexts,\n\n3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:37.920\n anthropomorphization is not gonna hurt you.\n\n3:19:37.920 --> 3:19:38.760\n Yes.\n\n3:19:38.760 --> 3:19:39.960\n Engineers run away from it too fast.\n\n3:19:39.960 --> 3:19:41.040\n I can see that.\n\n3:19:41.040 --> 3:19:43.680\n But from the most point, you're right.\n\n3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:48.680\n Do you have advice for young people today,\n\n3:19:48.680 --> 3:19:51.360\n like the 17 year old that you were,\n\n3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:53.600\n of how to live life?\n\n3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:56.440\n You can be proud of how to have a career\n\n3:19:56.440 --> 3:19:59.960\n you can be proud of in this world full of mullocks.\n\n3:20:00.880 --> 3:20:02.440\n Think about the win wins.\n\n3:20:02.440 --> 3:20:04.640\n Look for win win situations.\n\n3:20:05.520 --> 3:20:10.520\n And be careful not to, you know, overly use your smarts\n\n3:20:11.320 --> 3:20:13.000\n to convince yourself that something is win win\n\n3:20:13.000 --> 3:20:13.840\n when it's not.\n\n3:20:13.840 --> 3:20:14.680\n So that's difficult.\n\n3:20:14.680 --> 3:20:17.600\n And I don't know how to advise, you know, people on that\n\n3:20:17.600 --> 3:20:20.160\n because it's something I'm still figuring out myself.\n\n3:20:20.160 --> 3:20:23.920\n But have that as a sort of default MO.\n\n3:20:25.760 --> 3:20:28.080\n Don't see things, everything as a zero sum game.\n\n3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:30.680\n Try to find the positive sumness and like find ways\n\n3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:32.680\n if there doesn't seem to be one,\n\n3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:34.200\n consider playing a different game.\n\n3:20:34.200 --> 3:20:35.720\n So that I would suggest that.\n\n3:20:37.000 --> 3:20:38.760\n Do not become a professional poker player.\n\n3:20:38.760 --> 3:20:41.800\n I, cause people always ask that like, oh, she's a pro.\n\n3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:43.240\n I wanna do that too.\n\n3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:45.280\n Fine, you could have done it if you were, you know,\n\n3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:46.240\n when I started out,\n\n3:20:46.240 --> 3:20:48.280\n it was a very different situation back then.\n\n3:20:48.280 --> 3:20:52.600\n Poker is, you know, a great game to learn\n\n3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:54.960\n in order to understand the ways to think.\n\n3:20:54.960 --> 3:20:56.800\n And I recommend people learn it,\n\n3:20:56.800 --> 3:20:58.400\n but don't try and make a living from it these days.\n\n3:20:58.400 --> 3:21:00.280\n It's almost, it's very, very difficult\n\n3:21:00.280 --> 3:21:01.880\n to the point of being impossible.\n\n3:21:03.640 --> 3:21:08.640\n And then really, really be aware of how much time\n\n3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:12.120\n you spend on your phone and on social media\n\n3:21:12.120 --> 3:21:14.280\n and really try and keep it to a minimum.\n\n3:21:14.280 --> 3:21:17.040\n Be aware that basically every moment that you spend on it\n\n3:21:17.040 --> 3:21:18.120\n is bad for you.\n\n3:21:18.120 --> 3:21:20.160\n So it doesn't mean to say you can never do it,\n\n3:21:20.160 --> 3:21:22.520\n but just have that running in the background.\n\n3:21:22.520 --> 3:21:25.280\n I'm doing a bad thing for myself right now.\n\n3:21:25.280 --> 3:21:27.120\n I think that's the general rule of thumb.\n\n3:21:28.680 --> 3:21:31.160\n Of course, about becoming a professional poker player,\n\n3:21:31.160 --> 3:21:35.400\n if there is a thing in your life that's like that\n\n3:21:35.400 --> 3:21:38.680\n and nobody can convince you otherwise, just fucking do it.\n\n3:21:40.960 --> 3:21:42.680\n Don't listen to anyone's advice.\n\n3:21:44.080 --> 3:21:46.360\n Find a thing that you can't be talked out of too.\n\n3:21:46.360 --> 3:21:47.360\n That's a thing.\n\n3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:48.520\n I like that, yeah.\n\n3:21:50.160 --> 3:21:53.880\n You were a lead guitarist in a metal band?\n\n3:21:53.880 --> 3:21:54.720\n Oh.\n\n3:21:54.720 --> 3:21:56.960\n Did I write that down from something?\n\n3:21:56.960 --> 3:22:00.080\n What did you, what'd you do it for?\n\n3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:05.080\n The performing, was it the pure, the music of it?\n\n3:22:07.080 --> 3:22:08.960\n Was it just being a rock star?\n\n3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:09.960\n Why'd you do it?\n\n3:22:11.440 --> 3:22:15.400\n So we only ever played two gigs.\n\n3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:17.880\n We didn't last, you know, it wasn't a very,\n\n3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:20.560\n we weren't famous or anything like that.\n\n3:22:20.560 --> 3:22:25.280\n But I was very into metal.\n\n3:22:25.280 --> 3:22:27.440\n Like it was my entire identity,\n\n3:22:27.440 --> 3:22:29.320\n sort of from the age of 16 to 23.\n\n3:22:29.320 --> 3:22:31.640\n What's the best metal band of all time?\n\n3:22:31.640 --> 3:22:33.840\n Don't ask me that, it's so hard to answer.\n\n3:22:36.760 --> 3:22:39.800\n So I know I had a long argument with,\n\n3:22:40.800 --> 3:22:43.960\n I'm a guitarist, more like a classic rock guitarist.\n\n3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:46.600\n So, you know, I've had friends who are very big\n\n3:22:46.600 --> 3:22:49.800\n Pantera fans and so there was often arguments\n\n3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:52.480\n about what's the better metal band,\n\n3:22:52.480 --> 3:22:53.880\n Metallica versus Pantera.\n\n3:22:53.880 --> 3:22:57.360\n This is a more kind of 90s maybe discussion.\n\n3:22:57.360 --> 3:22:59.400\n But I was always on the side of Metallica,\n\n3:23:00.360 --> 3:23:02.760\n both musically and in terms of performance\n\n3:23:02.760 --> 3:23:06.120\n and the depth of lyrics and so on.\n\n3:23:06.120 --> 3:23:10.280\n So, but they were, basically everybody was against me.\n\n3:23:10.280 --> 3:23:12.280\n Because if you're a true metal fan,\n\n3:23:12.280 --> 3:23:14.520\n I guess the idea goes is you can't possibly\n\n3:23:14.520 --> 3:23:16.160\n be a Metallica fan.\n\n3:23:16.160 --> 3:23:19.560\n Because Metallica is pop, it's just like, they sold out.\n\n3:23:19.560 --> 3:23:20.600\n Metallica are metal.\n\n3:23:20.600 --> 3:23:24.920\n Like they were the, I mean, again, you can't say\n\n3:23:24.920 --> 3:23:26.520\n who was the godfather of metal, blah, blah, blah.\n\n3:23:26.520 --> 3:23:31.520\n But like they were so groundbreaking and so brilliant.\n\n3:23:32.680 --> 3:23:34.920\n I mean, you've named literally two of my favorite bands.\n\n3:23:34.920 --> 3:23:37.240\n Like when you asked that question, who are my favorites?\n\n3:23:37.240 --> 3:23:39.000\n Like those were two that came up.\n\n3:23:39.000 --> 3:23:41.480\n A third one is Children of Bodom,\n\n3:23:41.480 --> 3:23:44.960\n who I just think, oh, they just tick all the boxes for me.\n\n3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:48.160\n Yeah, I don't know.\n\n3:23:48.160 --> 3:23:51.800\n It's nowadays, like I kind of sort of feel\n\n3:23:51.800 --> 3:23:55.680\n like a repulsion to the, I was that myself.\n\n3:23:55.680 --> 3:23:56.880\n Like I'd be like, who do you prefer more?\n\n3:23:56.880 --> 3:23:58.880\n Come on, who's like, no, you have to rank them.\n\n3:23:58.880 --> 3:24:01.720\n But it's like this false zero sumness that's like, why?\n\n3:24:01.720 --> 3:24:02.600\n They're so additive.\n\n3:24:02.600 --> 3:24:04.560\n Like there's no conflict there.\n\n3:24:04.560 --> 3:24:06.960\n Although when people ask that kind of question\n\n3:24:06.960 --> 3:24:11.440\n about anything, movies, I feel like it's hard work.\n\n3:24:11.440 --> 3:24:14.880\n And it's unfair, but it's, you should pick one.\n\n3:24:14.880 --> 3:24:17.760\n Like, and that's actually the same kind of,\n\n3:24:17.760 --> 3:24:19.480\n it's like a fear of a commitment.\n\n3:24:19.480 --> 3:24:21.040\n When people ask me, what's your favorite band?\n\n3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:24.280\n It's like, but I, it's good to pick.\n\n3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:25.120\n Exactly.\n\n3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:27.640\n And thank you for the tough question, yeah.\n\n3:24:27.640 --> 3:24:29.480\n Well, maybe not in the context\n\n3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:31.800\n when a lot of people are listening.\n\n3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:33.960\n Yeah, I'm not just like, what, why does it matter?\n\n3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:35.560\n No, it does.\n\n3:24:35.560 --> 3:24:37.400\n Are you still into metal?\n\n3:24:37.400 --> 3:24:38.520\n Funny enough, I was listening to a bunch\n\n3:24:38.520 --> 3:24:39.840\n before I came over here.\n\n3:24:39.840 --> 3:24:43.680\n Oh, like, do you use it for like motivation\n\n3:24:43.680 --> 3:24:44.640\n or it gets you in a certain?\n\n3:24:44.640 --> 3:24:45.680\n Yeah, I was weirdly listening\n\n3:24:45.680 --> 3:24:48.120\n to 80s hair metal before I came.\n\n3:24:48.120 --> 3:24:49.840\n Does that count as metal?\n\n3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:53.440\n I think so, it's like proto metal and it's happy.\n\n3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:55.800\n It's optimistic, happy proto metal.\n\n3:24:56.760 --> 3:25:00.040\n Yeah, I mean, all these genres bleed into each other.\n\n3:25:00.040 --> 3:25:01.240\n But yeah, sorry, to answer your question\n\n3:25:01.240 --> 3:25:04.280\n about guitar playing, my relationship with it\n\n3:25:04.280 --> 3:25:09.120\n was kind of weird in that I was deeply uncreative.\n\n3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:11.240\n My objective would be to hear some really hard\n\n3:25:11.240 --> 3:25:14.320\n technical solo and then learn it, memorize it\n\n3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:15.960\n and then play it perfectly.\n\n3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:19.200\n But I was incapable of trying to write my own music.\n\n3:25:19.200 --> 3:25:21.600\n Like the idea was just absolutely terrifying.\n\n3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:24.640\n But I was also just thinking, I was like,\n\n3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:28.600\n it'd be kind of cool to actually try starting a band again\n\n3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:31.520\n and getting back into it and write.\n\n3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:34.000\n But it's scary.\n\n3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:34.840\n It's scary.\n\n3:25:34.840 --> 3:25:36.840\n I mean, I put out some guitar playing\n\n3:25:36.840 --> 3:25:38.120\n just other people's covers.\n\n3:25:38.120 --> 3:25:41.440\n I play Comfortly Numb on the internet.\n\n3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:42.480\n And it's scary too.\n\n3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:44.200\n It's scary putting stuff out there.\n\n3:25:45.320 --> 3:25:47.680\n And I had this similar kind of fascination\n\n3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:50.280\n with technical playing, both on piano and guitar.\n\n3:25:50.280 --> 3:25:52.120\n You know, one of the first,\n\n3:25:55.680 --> 3:25:58.120\n one of the reasons that I started learning guitar\n\n3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:01.760\n is from Ozzy Osbourne, Mr. Crowley's solo.\n\n3:26:01.760 --> 3:26:04.360\n And one of the first solos I learned is that,\n\n3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:07.600\n there's a beauty to it.\n\n3:26:07.600 --> 3:26:08.440\n There's a lot of beauty to it.\n\n3:26:08.440 --> 3:26:09.280\n It's tapping, right?\n\n3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:13.520\n Yeah, there's some tapping, but it's just really fast.\n\n3:26:14.480 --> 3:26:15.720\n Beautiful, like arpeggios.\n\n3:26:15.720 --> 3:26:16.960\n Yeah, arpeggios, yeah.\n\n3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:19.600\n But there's a melody that you can hear through it,\n\n3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:21.600\n but there's also build up.\n\n3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:22.800\n It's a beautiful solo,\n\n3:26:22.800 --> 3:26:25.920\n but it's also technically just visually the way it looks\n\n3:26:25.920 --> 3:26:29.640\n when a person's watching, you feel like a rockstar playing.\n\n3:26:29.640 --> 3:26:32.120\n But it ultimately has to do with technical.\n\n3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:36.440\n You're not developing the part of your brain\n\n3:26:36.440 --> 3:26:40.640\n that I think requires you to generate beautiful music.\n\n3:26:40.640 --> 3:26:42.360\n It is ultimately technical in nature.\n\n3:26:42.360 --> 3:26:45.840\n And so that took me a long time to let go of that\n\n3:26:45.840 --> 3:26:48.960\n and just be able to write music myself.\n\n3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:53.120\n And that's a different journey, I think.\n\n3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:55.080\n I think that journey is a little bit more inspired\n\n3:26:55.080 --> 3:26:57.080\n in the blues world, for example,\n\n3:26:57.080 --> 3:26:58.640\n where improvisation is more valued,\n\n3:26:58.640 --> 3:26:59.960\n obviously in jazz and so on.\n\n3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:04.960\n But I think ultimately it's a more rewarding journey\n\n3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:08.360\n because you get your relationship with the guitar\n\n3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:12.120\n then becomes a kind of escape from the world\n\n3:27:12.120 --> 3:27:16.080\n where you can create, I mean, creating stuff is.\n\n3:27:17.120 --> 3:27:18.720\n And it's something you work with,\n\n3:27:18.720 --> 3:27:20.240\n because my relationship with my guitar was like,\n\n3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:23.360\n it was something to tame and defeat.\n\n3:27:23.360 --> 3:27:24.760\n Yeah, it's a challenge.\n\n3:27:24.760 --> 3:27:26.960\n Which was kind of what my whole personality was back then.\n\n3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:29.520\n I was just very like, as I said, very competitive,\n\n3:27:29.520 --> 3:27:33.120\n very just like must bend this thing to my will.\n\n3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:37.840\n Whereas writing music, it's like a dance, you work with it.\n\n3:27:37.840 --> 3:27:39.880\n But I think because of the competitive aspect,\n\n3:27:39.880 --> 3:27:42.440\n for me at least, that's still there,\n\n3:27:42.440 --> 3:27:45.720\n which creates anxiety about playing publicly\n\n3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:47.080\n or all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:49.280\n I think there's just like a harsh self criticism\n\n3:27:49.280 --> 3:27:50.680\n within the whole thing.\n\n3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:53.320\n It's really tough.\n\n3:27:53.320 --> 3:27:55.320\n I wanna hear some of your stuff.\n\n3:27:55.320 --> 3:27:59.240\n I mean, there's certain things that feel really personal.\n\n3:27:59.240 --> 3:28:03.360\n And on top of that, as we talked about poker offline,\n\n3:28:03.360 --> 3:28:05.560\n there's certain things that you get to a certain height\n\n3:28:05.560 --> 3:28:07.160\n in your life, and that doesn't have to be very high,\n\n3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:09.080\n but you get to a certain height\n\n3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:11.760\n and then you put it aside for a bit.\n\n3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:13.160\n And it's hard to return to it\n\n3:28:13.160 --> 3:28:15.960\n because you remember being good.\n\n3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:19.880\n And it's hard to, like you being at a very high level\n\n3:28:19.880 --> 3:28:22.560\n in poker, it might be hard for you to return to poker\n\n3:28:22.560 --> 3:28:24.600\n every once in a while and enjoy it,\n\n3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:26.920\n knowing that you're just not as sharp as you used to be\n\n3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:29.680\n because you're not doing it every single day.\n\n3:28:29.680 --> 3:28:31.320\n That's something I always wonder with,\n\n3:28:31.320 --> 3:28:33.760\n I mean, even just like in chess with Kasparov,\n\n3:28:33.760 --> 3:28:36.200\n some of these greats, just returning to it,\n\n3:28:36.200 --> 3:28:38.400\n it's almost painful.\n\n3:28:38.400 --> 3:28:40.680\n And I feel that way with guitar too,\n\n3:28:40.680 --> 3:28:44.160\n because I used to play every day a lot.\n\n3:28:44.160 --> 3:28:46.080\n So returning to it is painful\n\n3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:48.720\n because it's like accepting the fact\n\n3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:51.480\n that this whole ride is finite\n\n3:28:51.480 --> 3:28:55.760\n and that you have a prime,\n\n3:28:55.760 --> 3:28:57.400\n there's a time when you were really good\n\n3:28:57.400 --> 3:28:58.800\n and now it's over and now.\n\n3:28:58.800 --> 3:29:00.360\n We're on a different chapter of life.\n\n3:29:00.360 --> 3:29:02.960\n I was like, oh, but I miss that.\n\n3:29:02.960 --> 3:29:06.560\n But you can still discover joy within that process.\n\n3:29:06.560 --> 3:29:09.160\n It's been tough, especially with some level of like,\n\n3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:13.680\n as people get to know you, and people film stuff,\n\n3:29:13.680 --> 3:29:18.680\n you don't have the privacy of just sharing something\n\n3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:20.600\n with a few people around you.\n\n3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:21.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:29:21.600 --> 3:29:23.080\n That's a beautiful privacy.\n\n3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:23.920\n That's a good point.\n\n3:29:23.920 --> 3:29:26.040\n With the internet, it's just disappearing.\n\n3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:27.760\n Yeah, that's a really good point.\n\n3:29:27.760 --> 3:29:29.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:29:29.160 --> 3:29:31.120\n But all those pressures aside,\n\n3:29:31.120 --> 3:29:32.920\n if you really, you can step up\n\n3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:37.920\n and still enjoy the fuck out of a good musical performance.\n\n3:29:39.120 --> 3:29:42.360\n What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?\n\n3:29:42.360 --> 3:29:43.600\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:45.600\n Oh, wow.\n\n3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:47.320\n It's in your name, as we talked about.\n\n3:29:47.320 --> 3:29:48.600\n You have to live up.\n\n3:29:48.600 --> 3:29:50.960\n Do you feel the requirement\n\n3:29:50.960 --> 3:29:54.200\n to have to live up to your name?\n\n3:29:54.200 --> 3:29:55.200\n Because live?\n\n3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:56.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:29:56.040 --> 3:29:57.760\n No, because I don't see it.\n\n3:29:57.760 --> 3:30:00.600\n I mean, my, oh, again, it's kind of like,\n\n3:30:02.440 --> 3:30:03.280\n no, I don't know.\n\n3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:05.320\n Because my full name is Olivia.\n\n3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:06.160\n Yeah.\n\n3:30:06.160 --> 3:30:07.200\n So I can retreat in that and be like,\n\n3:30:07.200 --> 3:30:09.000\n oh, Olivia, what does that even mean?\n\n3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:11.000\n Live up to live.\n\n3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:13.880\n No, I can't say I do,\n\n3:30:13.880 --> 3:30:15.400\n because I've never thought of it that way.\n\n3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:17.280\n And then your name backwards is evil.\n\n3:30:17.280 --> 3:30:18.880\n That's what we also talked about.\n\n3:30:18.880 --> 3:30:21.880\n I mean, I feel the urge to live up to that,\n\n3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:25.880\n to be the inverse of evil or even better.\n\n3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:27.480\n Because I don't think, you know,\n\n3:30:27.480 --> 3:30:29.000\n is the inverse of evil good\n\n3:30:29.000 --> 3:30:32.000\n or is good something completely separate to that?\n\n3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.040\n I think my intuition says it's the latter,\n\n3:30:34.040 --> 3:30:34.880\n but I don't know.\n\n3:30:34.880 --> 3:30:36.880\n Anyway, again, getting in the weeds.\n\n3:30:36.880 --> 3:30:39.280\n What is the meaning of all this?\n\n3:30:39.280 --> 3:30:40.120\n Of life.\n\n3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:42.080\n Why are we here?\n\n3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:44.720\n I think to,\n\n3:30:44.720 --> 3:30:47.040\n explore, have fun and understand\n\n3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:51.080\n and make more of here and to keep the game going.\n\n3:30:51.080 --> 3:30:51.920\n Of here?\n\n3:30:51.920 --> 3:30:52.760\n More of here?\n\n3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:55.280\n More of this, whatever this is.\n\n3:30:55.280 --> 3:30:57.240\n More of experience.\n\n3:30:57.240 --> 3:30:58.240\n Just to have more of experience\n\n3:30:58.240 --> 3:31:01.240\n and ideally positive experience.\n\n3:31:01.240 --> 3:31:05.240\n And more complex, you know,\n\n3:31:05.240 --> 3:31:06.840\n I guess, try and put it into a sort of\n\n3:31:06.840 --> 3:31:08.240\n vaguely scientific term.\n\n3:31:10.240 --> 3:31:11.080\n I don't know.\n\n3:31:11.080 --> 3:31:11.920\n I don't know.\n\n3:31:11.920 --> 3:31:12.760\n I don't know.\n\n3:31:12.760 --> 3:31:17.760\n But make it so that the program required,\n\n3:31:18.360 --> 3:31:21.480\n the length of code required to describe the universe\n\n3:31:21.480 --> 3:31:22.680\n is as long as possible.\n\n3:31:23.560 --> 3:31:27.120\n And, you know, highly complex and therefore interesting.\n\n3:31:27.120 --> 3:31:28.960\n Because again, like,\n\n3:31:28.960 --> 3:31:32.200\n I know, you know, we bang the metaphor to death,\n\n3:31:32.200 --> 3:31:36.000\n but like, tiled with X, you know,\n\n3:31:36.000 --> 3:31:37.880\n tiled with paperclips,\n\n3:31:37.880 --> 3:31:41.120\n doesn't require that much of a code to describe.\n\n3:31:41.120 --> 3:31:42.720\n Obviously, maybe something emerges from it,\n\n3:31:42.720 --> 3:31:44.840\n but that steady state, assuming a steady state,\n\n3:31:44.840 --> 3:31:45.680\n it's not very interesting.\n\n3:31:45.680 --> 3:31:49.720\n Whereas it seems like our universe is over time\n\n3:31:49.720 --> 3:31:51.960\n becoming more and more complex and interesting.\n\n3:31:51.960 --> 3:31:54.000\n There's so much richness and beauty and diversity\n\n3:31:54.000 --> 3:31:54.840\n on this earth.\n\n3:31:54.840 --> 3:31:56.280\n And I want that to continue and get more.\n\n3:31:56.280 --> 3:31:58.640\n I want more diversity.\n\n3:31:58.640 --> 3:32:00.640\n And the very best sense of that word\n\n3:32:01.880 --> 3:32:06.880\n is to me the goal of all this.\n\n3:32:07.040 --> 3:32:07.880\n Yeah.\n\n3:32:07.880 --> 3:32:10.880\n And somehow have fun in the process.\n\n3:32:10.880 --> 3:32:12.120\n Yes.\n\n3:32:12.120 --> 3:32:14.360\n Because we do create a lot of fun things along,\n\n3:32:14.360 --> 3:32:18.000\n instead of in this creative force\n\n3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:19.480\n and all the beautiful things we create,\n\n3:32:19.480 --> 3:32:22.520\n somehow there's like a funness to it.\n\n3:32:22.520 --> 3:32:25.160\n And perhaps that has to do with the finiteness of life,\n\n3:32:25.160 --> 3:32:27.160\n the finiteness of all these experiences,\n\n3:32:28.400 --> 3:32:30.400\n which is what makes them kind of unique.\n\n3:32:31.360 --> 3:32:32.920\n Like the fact that they end,\n\n3:32:32.920 --> 3:32:35.480\n there's this, whatever it is,\n\n3:32:35.480 --> 3:32:40.480\n falling in love or creating a piece of art\n\n3:32:40.480 --> 3:32:45.480\n or creating a bridge or creating a rocket\n\n3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:48.880\n or creating a, I don't know,\n\n3:32:48.880 --> 3:32:53.160\n just the businesses that build something\n\n3:32:53.160 --> 3:32:56.160\n or solve something.\n\n3:32:56.160 --> 3:32:59.200\n The fact that it is born and it dies\n\n3:33:00.840 --> 3:33:05.840\n somehow embeds it with fun, with joy\n\n3:33:07.040 --> 3:33:08.440\n for the people involved.\n\n3:33:08.440 --> 3:33:09.920\n I don't know what that is.\n\n3:33:09.920 --> 3:33:11.400\n The finiteness of it.\n\n3:33:11.400 --> 3:33:12.240\n It can do.\n\n3:33:12.240 --> 3:33:13.800\n Some people struggle with the,\n\n3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:17.880\n I mean, a big thing I think that one has to learn\n\n3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:21.120\n is being okay with things coming to an end.\n\n3:33:21.120 --> 3:33:25.640\n And in terms of like projects and so on,\n\n3:33:25.640 --> 3:33:27.120\n people cling onto things beyond\n\n3:33:27.120 --> 3:33:28.520\n what they're meant to be doing,\n\n3:33:28.520 --> 3:33:30.480\n beyond what is reasonable.\n\n3:33:32.040 --> 3:33:33.880\n And I'm gonna have to come to terms\n\n3:33:33.880 --> 3:33:35.800\n with this podcast coming to an end.\n\n3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:37.080\n I really enjoyed talking to you.\n\n3:33:37.080 --> 3:33:40.160\n I think it's obvious as we've talked about many times,\n\n3:33:40.160 --> 3:33:41.360\n you should be doing a podcast.\n\n3:33:41.360 --> 3:33:45.960\n You should, you're already doing a lot of stuff publicly\n\n3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:47.360\n to the world, which is awesome.\n\n3:33:47.360 --> 3:33:48.440\n And you're a great educator.\n\n3:33:48.440 --> 3:33:49.280\n You're a great mind.\n\n3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:50.280\n You're a great intellect.\n\n3:33:50.280 --> 3:33:52.840\n But it's also this whole medium of just talking\n\n3:33:52.840 --> 3:33:53.680\n is also fun.\n\n3:33:53.680 --> 3:33:54.520\n It is good.\n\n3:33:54.520 --> 3:33:55.360\n It's a fun one.\n\n3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:56.200\n It really is good.\n\n3:33:56.200 --> 3:33:58.840\n And it's just, it's nothing but like,\n\n3:33:58.840 --> 3:34:00.560\n oh, it's just so much fun.\n\n3:34:00.560 --> 3:34:03.160\n And you can just get into so many,\n\n3:34:03.160 --> 3:34:05.240\n yeah, there's this space to just explore\n\n3:34:05.240 --> 3:34:07.440\n and see what comes and emerges.\n\n3:34:07.440 --> 3:34:08.280\n And yeah.\n\n3:34:08.280 --> 3:34:09.320\n Yeah, to understand yourself better.\n\n3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:10.320\n And if you're talking to others,\n\n3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:12.560\n to understand them better and together with them.\n\n3:34:12.560 --> 3:34:15.320\n I mean, you should do your own podcast,\n\n3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:16.960\n but you should also do a podcast with C\n\n3:34:16.960 --> 3:34:18.640\n as we've talked about.\n\n3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:22.800\n The two of you have such different minds\n\n3:34:22.800 --> 3:34:26.040\n that like melt together in just hilarious ways,\n\n3:34:26.040 --> 3:34:29.320\n fascinating ways, just the tension of ideas there\n\n3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:30.240\n is really powerful.\n\n3:34:30.240 --> 3:34:33.200\n But in general, I think you got a beautiful voice.\n\n3:34:33.200 --> 3:34:35.320\n So thank you so much for talking today.\n\n3:34:35.320 --> 3:34:36.520\n Thank you for being a friend.\n\n3:34:36.520 --> 3:34:39.320\n Thank you for honoring me with this conversation\n\n3:34:39.320 --> 3:34:40.400\n and with your valuable time.\n\n3:34:40.400 --> 3:34:41.240\n Thanks, Liv.\n\n3:34:41.240 --> 3:34:42.560\n Thank you.\n\n3:34:42.560 --> 3:34:45.160\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Liv Marie.\n\n3:34:45.160 --> 3:34:46.280\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:34:46.280 --> 3:34:48.800\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:50.880\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:52.040\n from Richard Feynman.\n\n3:34:53.080 --> 3:34:56.240\n I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing\n\n3:34:56.240 --> 3:34:59.280\n than to have answers, which might be wrong.\n\n3:34:59.280 --> 3:35:01.800\n I have approximate answers and possible beliefs\n\n3:35:01.800 --> 3:35:05.120\n and different degrees of uncertainty about different things,\n\n3:35:05.120 --> 3:35:08.520\n but I'm not absolutely sure of anything.\n\n3:35:08.520 --> 3:35:11.480\n And there are many things I don't know anything about,\n\n3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:15.440\n such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here.\n\n3:35:15.440 --> 3:35:17.560\n I don't have to know the answer.\n\n3:35:17.560 --> 3:35:20.760\n I don't feel frightened not knowing things\n\n3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:24.280\n by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose,\n\n3:35:24.280 --> 3:35:27.520\n which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.\n\n3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:30.840\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
