  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:05.360\n The following is a conversation with Barry Barish, a theoretical physicist at Caltech\n\n00:05.360 --> 00:11.440\n and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to the LIGO detector\n\n00:11.440 --> 00:18.000\n and the observation of gravitational waves. LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave\n\n00:18.000 --> 00:24.320\n Observatory, is probably the most precise measurement device ever built by humans.\n\n00:24.320 --> 00:31.680\n It consists of two detectors with four kilometer long vacuum chambers situated three thousand\n\n00:31.680 --> 00:38.880\n kilometers apart, operating in unison to measure a motion that is ten thousand times smaller than\n\n00:38.880 --> 00:44.640\n the width of a proton. It is the smallest measurement ever attempted by science,\n\n00:44.640 --> 00:50.240\n a measurement of gravitational waves caused by the most violent and cataclysmic events\n\n00:50.240 --> 00:54.800\n in the universe, occurring over tens of millions of light years away.\n\n00:55.920 --> 00:59.840\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:59.840 --> 01:19.840\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast and here is my conversation with Barry Barish.\n\n01:31.680 --> 01:42.160\n Yeah, that memory is kind of something I use to illustrate something I think is common in science,\n\n01:42.160 --> 01:48.960\n that people that do science somehow have maintained something that kids always have.\n\n01:49.760 --> 01:57.760\n A small kid, eight years old or so, asks you so many questions usually, typically, that you\n\n01:57.760 --> 02:05.760\n consider them pests. You tell them to stop asking so many questions. And somehow our system manages\n\n02:05.760 --> 02:13.680\n to kill that in most people. So in school, we make people study and do their things,\n\n02:13.680 --> 02:21.760\n but not to pester them by asking too many questions. And I think, not just myself,\n\n02:21.760 --> 02:28.160\n but I think it's typical of scientists like myself that have somehow escaped that. Maybe\n\n02:28.160 --> 02:36.320\n we're still children or maybe we somehow didn't get it beaten out of us. But I teach it in college\n\n02:36.320 --> 02:42.400\n level and it's, to me, one of the biggest deficits is the lack of curiosity, if you want,\n\n02:42.400 --> 02:46.480\n that we've beaten out of them because I think it's an innate human quality.\n\n02:46.480 --> 02:50.560\n Is there some advice or insights you can give to how to keep that flame of curiosity going?\n\n02:50.560 --> 02:57.920\n I think it's a problem of both parents and that parents should realize that's a great quality we\n\n02:57.920 --> 03:03.840\n have. That you're curious and that's good. Instead, we have expressions like curiosity\n\n03:03.840 --> 03:14.160\n killed the cat and more. But basically, it's not thought to be a good thing. Curiosity\n\n03:14.160 --> 03:16.960\n killed the cat means if you're too curious, you get in trouble.\n\n03:16.960 --> 03:21.200\n I don't like cats anyway, so maybe it's a good thing.\n\n03:21.200 --> 03:28.960\n Yeah. That, to me, needs to be solved, really, in education and in homes. It's a realization\n\n03:28.960 --> 03:34.480\n that there's certain human qualities that we should try to build on and not destroy. One of\n\n03:34.480 --> 03:40.160\n them is curiosity. Anyway, back to me and curiosity. I was a pest and asked a lot of\n\n03:40.160 --> 03:46.880\n questions. My father generally could answer them at that age. And the first one I remember that he\n\n03:46.880 --> 03:56.320\n couldn't answer was not a very original question, but basically that ice is made out of water,\n\n03:56.320 --> 04:05.680\n and so why does it float on water? He couldn't answer it. It may not have been the first\n\n04:05.680 --> 04:11.040\n question. It's the first one that I remember. And that was the first time that I realized that\n\n04:11.040 --> 04:17.840\n to learn and answer your own curiosity or questions, there's various mechanisms. In\n\n04:17.840 --> 04:23.600\n this case, it was going to the library or asking people who know more and so forth. But\n\n04:23.600 --> 04:33.200\n eventually, you do it by what we call research. But it's driven by, hopefully, you ask good\n\n04:33.200 --> 04:37.920\n questions. If you ask good questions and you have the mechanism to solve them, then you do what I\n\n04:37.920 --> 04:45.040\n do in life, basically, not necessarily physics. And it's a great quality in humans, and we should\n\n04:45.040 --> 04:52.320\n nurture it. Do you remember any other kind of in high school, maybe early college, more basic\n\n04:52.320 --> 04:57.360\n physics ideas that sparked your curiosity or mathematics or science in general?\n\n04:57.360 --> 05:02.960\n I wasn't really into science until I got to college, to be honest with you. But\n\n05:02.960 --> 05:14.320\n just staying with water for a minute, I remember that I was curious what happens to water. It rains\n\n05:14.320 --> 05:18.560\n and there's water in a wet pavement, and then the pavement dries out. What happened to this\n\n05:19.120 --> 05:24.960\n water that came down? And I didn't know that much. And then eventually, I learned in chemistry or\n\n05:24.960 --> 05:29.840\n something, water is made out of hydrogen and oxygen. Those are both gases. So how the heck\n\n05:29.840 --> 05:38.560\n does it make this substance? It's liquid. Yeah, so that has to do with states of matter.\n\n05:39.440 --> 05:46.480\n I know perhaps LIGO and the thing for which you've gotten the Nobel Prize and the things\n\n05:46.480 --> 05:53.040\n much of your life work perhaps was a happy accident in some sense in the early days. But\n\n05:53.040 --> 05:57.840\n is there a moment where you looked up to the stars and also, the same way you wondered about water,\n\n05:57.840 --> 06:00.640\n wondered about some of the things that are out there in the universe?\n\n06:01.600 --> 06:10.240\n Oh, yeah, I think everybody looks and is in awe and is curious about what it is out there. And\n\n06:10.240 --> 06:17.280\n as I learned more, I learned, of course, that we don't know very much about what's there. And the\n\n06:17.280 --> 06:22.720\n more we learn, the more we know we don't know. I mean, we don't know what the majority of anything\n\n06:22.720 --> 06:27.840\n is out there. It's all what we call dark matter and dark energy. And that's one of the big\n\n06:27.840 --> 06:33.280\n questions. When I was a student, those weren't questions. So we even know less, in a sense,\n\n06:33.280 --> 06:43.200\n the more we look. So of course, I think that's one of the areas that almost it's universal.\n\n06:43.200 --> 06:49.040\n People see the sky, they see the stars and they're beautiful and see it looks different\n\n06:49.040 --> 06:52.880\n on different nights. And it's a curiosity that we all have.\n\n06:54.160 --> 07:01.040\n What are some questions about the universe that in the same way that you felt about the ice\n\n07:01.600 --> 07:07.040\n that today? You mentioned to me offline, you're teaching a course on the frontiers of science,\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:12.800\n frontiers of physics. What are some questions outside the ones we'll probably talk about that\n\n07:12.800 --> 07:23.520\n kind of, yeah, fill you with the, get your flame of curiosity up and firing up, you know,\n\n07:23.520 --> 07:29.280\n fill you with awe? Well, first, I'm a physicist, not an astronomer. So I'm interested in the\n\n07:29.280 --> 07:36.960\n physical phenomenon, really. So the question of dark matter and dark energy, which we probably\n\n07:36.960 --> 07:45.360\n won't talk about, our recent last 20, 30 years, certainly dark energy. Dark energy is a complete\n\n07:45.360 --> 07:53.280\n puzzle. It goes against what you will ask me about, which is general relativity and Einstein's\n\n07:53.280 --> 08:00.400\n general relativity. It basically takes something that he thought was what he called a constant,\n\n08:00.400 --> 08:09.760\n which isn't. And if that's even the right theory, and it represents most of the universe. And then\n\n08:09.760 --> 08:14.480\n we have something called dark matter, and there's good reason to believe it might be an exotic form\n\n08:14.480 --> 08:22.800\n of particles. And that is something I've always worked on, on particle accelerators and so forth.\n\n08:22.800 --> 08:28.320\n And it's a big puzzle, what it is. It's a bit of a cottage industry in that there's lots and lots\n\n08:28.320 --> 08:34.320\n of searches, but it may be a little bit like, you know, looking for a treasure under rocks or\n\n08:34.320 --> 08:40.640\n something. You don't, it's hard to, we don't have really good guidance, except that we have very,\n\n08:40.640 --> 08:49.520\n very good information that is pervasive and it's there. And that it's probably particles, small,\n\n08:49.520 --> 08:57.200\n that the evidence is all of those things. But then the most logical solution doesn't seem to work,\n\n08:57.200 --> 09:04.880\n something called supersymmetry. And do you think the answer could be something very complicated?\n\n09:06.400 --> 09:12.560\n You know, I like to hope that, think that most things that appear complicated are actually\n\n09:12.560 --> 09:19.440\n simple if you really understand them. I think we just don't know at the present time, and it isn't\n\n09:19.440 --> 09:26.480\n something that affects us. It does affect, it affects how the stars go around each other and so\n\n09:26.480 --> 09:32.960\n forth, because we detect that there's missing gravity, but it doesn't affect everyday life at\n\n09:32.960 --> 09:42.480\n all. I tend to think and expect maybe, and that the answers will be simple. We just haven't found\n\n09:42.480 --> 09:48.800\n it yet. Do you think those answers might change the way we see other sources of gravity, black holes,\n\n09:49.280 --> 09:57.280\n the way we see the parts of the universe that we do study? It's conceivable. The black holes that\n\n09:57.280 --> 10:06.000\n we've found in our experiment, we're trying now to understand the origin of those. It's conceivable,\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:11.360\n but doesn't seem the most likely that they were primordial, that is, they were made at the\n\n10:11.360 --> 10:15.840\n beginning. And in that sense, they could represent at least part of the dark matter.\n\n10:16.800 --> 10:23.040\n So there can be connections, dark black holes or how many there are, how much of the mass they\n\n10:23.040 --> 10:28.560\n encompass is still pretty primitive. We don't know. So before I talk to you more about black holes,\n\n10:28.560 --> 10:33.760\n let me take a step back to, I actually went to high school in Chicago and would go to\n\n10:34.720 --> 10:43.120\n take classes at Fermilab, watch the buffalo and so on. So let me ask about, you mentioned that Enrico\n\n10:43.120 --> 10:50.080\n for me was somebody who was inspiring to you in a certain kind of way. Why is that? Can you speak\n\n10:50.080 --> 10:59.440\n to that? Sure. He was amazing, actually. He's the last, I'll come to the reason in a minute, but\n\n11:00.960 --> 11:11.200\n he had a big influence on me at a young age. But he was the last physicist of note that was both\n\n11:11.200 --> 11:17.680\n an experimental physicist and a theorist at the same time. And he did two amazing things within\n\n11:17.680 --> 11:29.360\n months in 1933. We didn't really know what the nucleus was, what radioactive decay was,\n\n11:29.360 --> 11:42.880\n what beta decay was when electrons come out of a nucleus. And near the end of 1933, the neutron had\n\n11:42.880 --> 11:47.680\n just been discovered. And that meant that we knew a little bit more about what the nucleus is, that\n\n11:47.680 --> 11:54.640\n it's made out of neutrons and protons. The neutron wasn't discovered till 1932. And then once we\n\n11:54.640 --> 12:00.160\n discovered that there was a neutron and proton and they made the nucleus and then their electrons\n\n12:00.160 --> 12:08.240\n that go around, the basic ingredients were there. And he wrote down not only just the theory,\n\n12:08.240 --> 12:16.560\n a theory, but a theory that lasted decades and has only been improved on of beta decay, that is,\n\n12:16.560 --> 12:24.480\n the radiation. He did this, came out of nowhere, and it was a fantastic theory. He submitted it\n\n12:24.480 --> 12:33.040\n to Nature magazine, which was the primary best place to publish even then. And it got rejected\n\n12:33.040 --> 12:42.000\n as being too speculative. And so he went back to his drawing board in Rome where he was,\n\n12:42.800 --> 12:48.720\n added some to it, made it even longer, because it's really a classic article, and then published\n\n12:48.720 --> 12:58.720\n it in the local Italian journal for physics and the German one. At the same time, in January of\n\n12:58.720 --> 13:07.360\n 1932, Giulio and Curie, for the first time, saw artificial radioactivity. This was an important\n\n13:07.360 --> 13:14.080\n discovery because radioactivity had been discovered much earlier. They had x rays and you\n\n13:14.080 --> 13:19.680\n shouldn't be using them, but there was radioactivity. People knew it was useful for medicine.\n\n13:21.440 --> 13:26.960\n But radioactive materials are hard to find, and so it wasn't prevalent. But if you could make them,\n\n13:26.960 --> 13:35.440\n they had great use. And Giulio and Curie were able to bombard aluminum or something with alpha\n\n13:35.440 --> 13:44.720\n particles and find that they excited something that decayed and had some half life and so forth,\n\n13:44.720 --> 13:51.520\n meaning it was artificial version, or let's call it not a natural version, an induced version of\n\n13:51.520 --> 14:04.800\n radioactive materials. And Fermi somehow had the insight, and I still can't see where he got it,\n\n14:05.440 --> 14:12.400\n that the right way to follow that up was not using charged particles like alphas and so forth,\n\n14:12.400 --> 14:19.840\n but use these newly discovered neutrons as the bombarding particle. It seemed impossible\n\n14:19.840 --> 14:26.640\n they barely had been seen. It was hard to get very many of them. But it had the advantage that\n\n14:26.640 --> 14:35.840\n they're not charged, so they go right into the nucleus. And that turned out to be the experimental\n\n14:35.840 --> 14:42.880\n work that he did that won him the Nobel Prize. And it was the first step in fission, discovery\n\n14:42.880 --> 14:50.000\n of fission. And he did this two completely different things, an experiment that was a great\n\n14:50.000 --> 14:57.520\n idea and a tremendous implementation, because how do you get enough neutrons? And then he learned\n\n14:58.080 --> 15:04.000\n quickly that not only do you want neutrons, but you want really slow ones. He learned that\n\n15:04.000 --> 15:09.680\n experimentally, and he learned how to make slow ones, and then they were able to go through the\n\n15:09.680 --> 15:16.960\n go through the periodic table and make lots of particles. He missed on fission at the moment,\n\n15:16.960 --> 15:21.760\n but he had the basic information, and then fission follows soon after that.\n\n15:21.760 --> 15:27.280\n Forgive me for not knowing, but is the birth of the idea of bombarding with neutrons,\n\n15:29.200 --> 15:35.760\n is that an experimental idea? Was it born out of an experiment? Did he just observe something,\n\n15:35.760 --> 15:40.160\n or is this an Einstein style idea where you come up from basic intuition?\n\n15:40.160 --> 15:46.560\n I think it took a combination, because he realized that neutrons had a characteristic\n\n15:46.560 --> 15:51.360\n that would allow them to go all the way into the nucleus when we didn't really understand\n\n15:53.760 --> 16:00.640\n what the structure was of all this. So that took an understanding or recognition of the physics\n\n16:00.640 --> 16:06.320\n itself of how a neutron interacts compared to, say, an alpha particle that Julio and Curie had\n\n16:06.320 --> 16:16.640\n used. And then he had to invent a way to have enough neutrons, and he had a team of associates,\n\n16:16.640 --> 16:20.560\n and he pulled it off quite quickly. So it was pretty astounding.\n\n16:21.920 --> 16:28.640\n And probably, maybe you can speak to it, his ability to put together the engineering aspects\n\n16:28.640 --> 16:33.440\n of great experiments and doing the theory, they probably fed each other. I wonder,\n\n16:33.440 --> 16:37.760\n can you speak to why we don't see more of that? Is that just really difficult to do?\n\n16:38.400 --> 16:45.200\n It's difficult to do. Yeah, I think in both theory and experiment in physics anyway,\n\n16:47.920 --> 16:52.960\n it was conceivable if you had the right person to do it, and no one's been able to do it since. So\n\n16:52.960 --> 16:56.480\n I had the dream that that was what I was going to be like, Fermi.\n\n16:56.480 --> 17:01.680\n But you love both sides of it, the theory. Yeah, I never liked the idea that you did\n\n17:01.680 --> 17:05.760\n experiments without really understanding the theory, or the theory should be related\n\n17:05.760 --> 17:11.600\n very closely to experiments. And so I've always done experimental work that was closely related\n\n17:11.600 --> 17:16.640\n to the theoretical ideas. I think I told you I'm Russian,\n\n17:16.640 --> 17:23.440\n so I'm going to ask some romantic questions. But is it tragic to you that he's seen as the\n\n17:23.440 --> 17:29.440\n architect of the nuclear age, that some of his creations led to potentially, some of his work\n\n17:30.560 --> 17:37.120\n has led to potentially still the destruction of the human species, some of the most destructive\n\n17:38.080 --> 17:47.120\n weapons? Yeah, I think even more general than him, I gave you all the virtues of curiosity a few\n\n17:47.120 --> 17:52.320\n minutes ago. There's an interesting book called The Ratchet of Curiosity. A ratchet is something\n\n17:52.320 --> 17:59.520\n that goes in one direction. And that is written by a guy who's probably a sociologist or philosopher\n\n17:59.520 --> 18:06.080\n or something. And he picks on this particular problem, but other ones. And that is the danger\n\n18:06.080 --> 18:11.040\n of knowledge, basically. You're curious, you learn something. So it's a little bit like\n\n18:11.040 --> 18:16.320\n curiosity killed the cat. You have to be worried about whether you can handle new information that\n\n18:16.320 --> 18:22.960\n you get. So in this case, the new information had to do with really understanding nuclear physics.\n\n18:22.960 --> 18:30.240\n And that information, maybe we didn't have the sophistication to know how to keep it under\n\n18:30.240 --> 18:40.640\n control. And Fermi himself was a very apolitical person. So he wasn't very driven by, or at least\n\n18:41.200 --> 18:46.080\n he appears in all of his writing, the writing of his wife, the interactions that others had with\n\n18:46.080 --> 18:52.000\n him. Either he avoided it all or he was pretty apolitical. I mean, he just saw the world through\n\n18:52.000 --> 19:01.120\n kind of the lens of a scientist. But he asked if it's tragic. The bomb was tragic, certainly on\n\n19:01.120 --> 19:08.640\n Japan. And he had a role in that. So I wouldn't want it as my legacy, for example. But brought\n\n19:08.640 --> 19:19.200\n it to the human species that it's the ratchet of curiosity that we do stuff just to see what\n\n19:19.200 --> 19:26.720\n happens. That curiosity, that in sort of my area of artificial intelligence, that's been a concern.\n\n19:27.840 --> 19:33.760\n On a small scale, on a silly scale, perhaps currently, there's constantly unintended\n\n19:33.760 --> 19:40.240\n consequences. You create a system and you put it out there and you have intuitions about how\n\n19:40.240 --> 19:44.240\n it will work. You have hopes how it will work, but you put it out there just to see what happens.\n\n19:44.960 --> 19:49.680\n And in most cases, because artificial intelligence is currently not super powerful,\n\n19:49.680 --> 19:58.240\n it doesn't create a large scale negative effects, but that same curiosity as it progresses might\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:04.720\n lead to something that destroys the human species. And the same may be true for bioengineering.\n\n20:04.720 --> 20:15.760\n There's people that engineer viruses to protect us from viruses to see how close is this to\n\n20:15.760 --> 20:25.520\n mutating so it can jump to humans or engineering defenses against those. And it seems exciting and\n\n20:25.520 --> 20:30.320\n the application, the positive applications are really exciting at this time, but we don't think\n\n20:30.320 --> 20:36.720\n about how that runs away in decades to come. Yeah. And I think it's the same idea as this\n\n20:36.720 --> 20:46.240\n little book, The Ratchet of Science, The Ratchet of Curiosity. I mean, whether you pursue,\n\n20:46.240 --> 20:53.280\n take curiosity and let artificial intelligence or machine learning run away with having its\n\n20:53.280 --> 20:58.560\n solutions to whatever you want, or we do it, it's, I think, a similar consequence.\n\n20:59.120 --> 21:07.040\n I think from what I've read about Enrico Fermi, he became a little bit cynical about the human\n\n21:07.040 --> 21:11.200\n species towards the end of his life, both having observed what he observed.\n\n21:12.560 --> 21:20.160\n Well, he didn't write much. I mean, he died young. He died soon after the World War. There was\n\n21:20.160 --> 21:26.880\n already, you know, the work by Teller to develop the hydrogen bomb. And I think he was a little\n\n21:26.880 --> 21:32.960\n cynical of that, you know, pushing it even further and rising tensions between the Soviet Union and\n\n21:32.960 --> 21:38.320\n the U.S. and looked like an endless thing. So, but he didn't say very much, but a little bit,\n\n21:38.320 --> 21:45.520\n as you said. Yeah, there's a few clips to sort of maybe picked on a bad mood, but in a sense that\n\n21:45.520 --> 21:55.440\n almost like a sadness, a melancholy sadness to a hope that waned a little bit about that perhaps we\n\n21:55.440 --> 22:02.640\n can do, like this curious species can find the way out. Well, especially, I think, people who\n\n22:02.640 --> 22:08.800\n worked like he did at Los Alamos and spent years of their life somehow had to convince themselves\n\n22:08.800 --> 22:18.240\n that dropping these bombs would bring lasting peace and that it didn't. Yeah. As a small,\n\n22:18.240 --> 22:23.600\n interesting aside, it'd be interesting to hear if you have opinions on this. His name is also\n\n22:23.600 --> 22:30.960\n attached to the Fermi Paradox, which asks if there is a, you know, it's a very interesting question,\n\n22:30.960 --> 22:37.520\n which is if it does seem if you sort of reason basically that there should be a lot of alien\n\n22:37.520 --> 22:46.080\n civilizations out there. If the human species, if Earth is not that unique by basic, no matter the\n\n22:46.080 --> 22:52.400\n values you pick, it's likely that there's a lot of alien civilizations out there. And if that's the\n\n22:52.400 --> 22:59.840\n case, why have they not at least obviously visited us or sent us loud signals that everybody can\n\n22:59.840 --> 23:09.200\n hear? Fermi's quoted as saying, sitting down at lunch, I think it was with Teller and Herb York,\n\n23:09.200 --> 23:15.520\n who was kind of one of the fathers of the atomic bomb. And he sat down and he said something like,\n\n23:15.520 --> 23:25.280\n where are they? Which meant, where are these other? And then he did some numerology where he\n\n23:25.280 --> 23:31.680\n calculated, you know, how many, what they knew about how many galaxies there are and how many\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:37.120\n stars and how many planets then are like the Earth and blah, blah, blah. That's been done much\n\n23:37.120 --> 23:42.240\n better by somebody named Drake. And so, people usually refer to the, I don't know whether it's\n\n23:42.240 --> 23:47.440\n called the Drake formula or something, but it has the same conclusion. The conclusion is it would\n\n23:47.440 --> 23:53.760\n be a miracle if there weren't other, you know, the statistics are so high that how can we be\n\n23:53.760 --> 24:04.160\n singular and separate? So, probably there is, but there's almost certainly life somewhere. Maybe\n\n24:04.160 --> 24:13.840\n there was even life on Mars a while back, but intelligent life, probably. So, you know, the\n\n24:13.840 --> 24:25.440\n statistics say that communicating with us, I think that it's harder than people think. We might not\n\n24:25.440 --> 24:34.160\n know the right way to expect the communication, but all the communication that we know about\n\n24:34.160 --> 24:41.040\n travels at the speed of light. And we don't think anything can go faster than the speed of light.\n\n24:41.040 --> 24:48.560\n That limits the problem quite a bit. And it makes it difficult to have any back and forth\n\n24:48.560 --> 24:54.640\n communication. You could send signals like we try to or look for, but to have any communication,\n\n24:54.640 --> 25:00.880\n it's pretty hard when it has to be close enough that the speed of light would mean we could\n\n25:00.880 --> 25:06.400\n communicate with each other. And I think, and we didn't even understand that. I mean, we're\n\n25:06.400 --> 25:11.520\n an advanced civilization, but we didn't even understand that a little more than a hundred\n\n25:11.520 --> 25:22.160\n years ago. So, are we just not advanced enough? Maybe to know something about that's the speed\n\n25:22.160 --> 25:26.880\n of light. Maybe there's some other way to communicate that isn't based on electromagnetism.\n\n25:26.880 --> 25:33.760\n I don't know. Gravity seems to be also have the same speed. That was a principle that Einstein\n\n25:33.760 --> 25:39.520\n had and something we've measured actually. So is it possible? I mean, so we'll talk about\n\n25:39.520 --> 25:47.520\n gravitational waves and in some sense, there's a brainstorming going on, which is like,\n\n25:48.400 --> 25:52.880\n how do we detect the signal? Like what would a signal look like and how would we detect it? And\n\n25:52.880 --> 25:57.840\n that's true for gravitational waves. That's true for basically any physics phenomena. You have to\n\n25:57.840 --> 26:02.080\n predict that that signal should exist. You have to have some kind of theory and model why that signal\n\n26:02.080 --> 26:09.200\n should exist. I mean, is it possible that aliens are communicating with us via gravity? Like why\n\n26:09.200 --> 26:18.960\n not? Well, yeah, it's true. Why not? For us, it's very hard to detect these gravitational effects.\n\n26:18.960 --> 26:24.880\n They have to come from something pretty that has a lot of gravity like black holes, but we're\n\n26:24.880 --> 26:35.680\n pretty primitive at this stage. There's very reputable physicists that look for a fifth force,\n\n26:36.560 --> 26:44.320\n one that we haven't found yet. Maybe it's the key. What would a fifth force of physics look\n\n26:44.320 --> 26:50.080\n like exactly? Well, usually they think it's probably a longer range force than we have now.\n\n26:50.080 --> 26:56.480\n But there are reputable colleagues of mine that spend their life looking for a fifth force.\n\n26:56.480 --> 27:02.240\n So longer range than gravity? Yeah. Super long? It doesn't fall off like one over r squared,\n\n27:02.240 --> 27:10.480\n but maybe separately. Gravity, Newton taught us, goes like inversely one over the square of the\n\n27:10.480 --> 27:14.400\n distance apart you are. So it falls pretty fast. That's okay. So now we have a theory of what\n\n27:14.400 --> 27:20.640\n consciousness is. It's just the fifth force of physics. Yeah. There we go. That's a good hypothesis.\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:31.360\n Speaking of gravity, what are gravitational waves? Let's maybe start from the basics.\n\n27:32.720 --> 27:39.920\n We learned gravity from Newton, right? When you were young, you were told that if you jumped up,\n\n27:39.920 --> 27:46.720\n the earth pulls you down. And when the apple falls out of the tree, the earth pulls it down.\n\n27:47.920 --> 27:54.480\n And maybe you even asked your teacher why, but most of us accepted that. That was Newton's\n\n27:55.440 --> 28:00.400\n picture, the apple falling out of the tree. But Newton's theory never told you why the apple\n\n28:00.400 --> 28:07.920\n was attracted to the earth. That was a missing in Newton's theory. Newton's theory also\n\n28:07.920 --> 28:12.720\n Newton recognized at least one of the two problems. I'll tell you one of them is there's more than\n\n28:12.720 --> 28:20.080\n those, but one is why does the earth, what's the mechanism by which the earth pulls the apple or\n\n28:20.080 --> 28:25.920\n holds the moon when it goes around, whatever it is. That's not explained by Newton, even though he\n\n28:25.920 --> 28:31.040\n has the most successful theory of physics ever went 200 and some years with nobody ever seeing\n\n28:31.040 --> 28:38.960\n a violation. But he accurately describes the movement of an object falling down to earth,\n\n28:38.960 --> 28:44.000\n but he's not answering why that what's yeah, because it's a distance. He gives a formula,\n\n28:45.120 --> 28:51.760\n which it's a product of the earth's mass, the apple's mass inversely proportional to the square\n\n28:51.760 --> 28:57.280\n of the distance between and then the strength he called capital G, the strength he couldn't\n\n28:57.280 --> 29:03.840\n determine, but it was determined 100 years later. But no one ever saw a violation of this until a\n\n29:03.840 --> 29:08.800\n possible violation, which Einstein fixed, which was very small that has to do with\n\n29:08.800 --> 29:16.400\n mercury going around the sun, the orbit being slightly wrong if you calculate it by Newton's\n\n29:16.400 --> 29:25.280\n theory. But so like most theories then in physics, you can have a wonderful one like Newton's theory.\n\n29:25.280 --> 29:34.000\n It isn't wrong. But you have to have an improvement on it to answer things that it can't answer. And\n\n29:34.000 --> 29:41.040\n in this case, Einstein's theory is the next step. We don't know if it's anything like a final theory\n\n29:41.040 --> 29:51.440\n or even the only way to formulate it either. But he formulated this theory, which he released in 1915.\n\n29:51.440 --> 29:56.960\n He took 10 years to develop it, even though in 1905, he solved three or four of the most important\n\n29:56.960 --> 30:01.600\n problems in physics in a matter of months. And then he spent 10 years on this problem before he\n\n30:02.480 --> 30:06.080\n let it out. And this is called general relativity. It's a new theory of gravity.\n\n30:07.120 --> 30:18.720\n 1915. In 1916, Einstein wrote a little paper where he did not do some fancy derivation.\n\n30:18.720 --> 30:30.000\n Instead, he did what I would call he used his intuition, which he was very good at too. And that\n\n30:30.000 --> 30:36.400\n is he noticed that if he wrote the formulas for general relativity in a particular way,\n\n30:37.200 --> 30:40.800\n they looked a lot like the formulas for electricity and magnetism.\n\n30:40.800 --> 30:46.800\n Being Einstein, he then took the leap that electricity and magnetism, we discovered only\n\n30:46.800 --> 30:54.560\n 20 years before that in the 1880s, have waves. Of course, that's light and electromagnetic waves,\n\n30:54.560 --> 31:01.440\n radio waves, everything else. So he said, if the formulas look similar, then gravity probably has\n\n31:01.440 --> 31:10.400\n waves too. That's such a big leap, by the way. I mean, maybe you could go back to the 1880s,\n\n31:10.400 --> 31:15.120\n maybe you can correct me, but that just seems like a heck of a leap.\n\n31:15.120 --> 31:21.280\n Yeah. And it was considered to be a heck of a leap. So first that paper was, except for this\n\n31:22.080 --> 31:30.320\n intuition, was poorly written, had a serious mistake. It had a factor of two wrong in the\n\n31:30.320 --> 31:37.200\n strength of gravity, which meant if we use those formulas, we would... And two years later,\n\n31:37.200 --> 31:43.680\n he wrote a second paper. And in that paper, it turns out to be important for us because in that\n\n31:43.680 --> 31:50.480\n paper, he not only fixed his factor of two mistake, which he never admitted, he just wrote it,\n\n31:50.480 --> 31:58.640\n fixed it like he always did. And then he told us how you make gravitational waves, what makes\n\n31:58.640 --> 32:05.200\n gravitational waves. And you might recall in electromagnetism, we make electromagnetic waves\n\n32:05.200 --> 32:10.160\n in a simple way. You take a plus charge and minus charge, you oscillate like this, and that makes\n\n32:10.160 --> 32:16.320\n the electromagnetic waves. And a physicist named Hertz made a receiver that could detect the waves\n\n32:16.320 --> 32:22.160\n and put it in the next room. He saw them and moved forward and backward and saw that it was wave like.\n\n32:22.160 --> 32:30.400\n So Einstein said, it won't be a dipole like that, it'll be a four pole thing. And that's what it's\n\n32:30.400 --> 32:36.880\n called, it's called a quadrupole moment that gives the gravitational wave. So that again, by insight,\n\n32:36.880 --> 32:43.360\n not by derivation. That set the table for what you needed to do to do it. At the same time,\n\n32:43.360 --> 32:49.520\n in the same year, Schwarzschild, not Einstein, said there were things called black holes. So\n\n32:49.520 --> 32:56.640\n it's interesting that that came the same. So what year was that? 1915. It was in parallel...\n\n32:56.640 --> 33:01.920\n Well, I should probably know this, but did Einstein not have an intuition that there\n\n33:01.920 --> 33:06.400\n should be such things as black holes? That came from Schwarzschild. Oh, interesting.\n\n33:07.200 --> 33:14.400\n Yeah. So Schwarzschild, who was a German theoretical physicist, he got killed in the war,\n\n33:14.400 --> 33:21.520\n I think, in the First World War, two years later or so. He's the one that proposed black holes,\n\n33:21.520 --> 33:27.120\n that there were black holes. That feels like a natural conclusion of general relativity, no? Or\n\n33:27.120 --> 33:33.840\n is that not? Well, it may seem like it, but I don't know about a natural conclusion. It's a result\n\n33:34.560 --> 33:39.600\n of curved space time though. Right. But it's such a weird result that you might have to...\n\n33:40.560 --> 33:48.960\n It's a special... Yeah, it's a special case. Yeah. So I don't know. Anyway, Einstein then,\n\n33:48.960 --> 33:54.000\n an interesting part of the story is that Einstein then left the problem. Most physicists,\n\n33:54.000 --> 34:01.120\n because it really wasn't derived, he just made this, didn't pick up on it or general relativity\n\n34:01.120 --> 34:10.080\n much because quantum mechanics became the thing in physics. And Einstein only picked up this\n\n34:10.080 --> 34:18.000\n problem again after he immigrated to the US. So he came to the US in 1932. And I think in 1934 or\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:24.400\n 1935, he was working with another physicist called Rosen, who he did several important works with,\n\n34:24.400 --> 34:32.880\n and they revisited the question. And they had a problem that most of us as students always had,\n\n34:32.880 --> 34:37.680\n that study general relativity. General relativity is really hard because it's four dimensional\n\n34:37.680 --> 34:42.800\n instead of three dimensional. And if you don't set it up right, you get infinities,\n\n34:42.800 --> 34:49.520\n which don't belong there. We call them coordinate singularities as a name. But if you get these\n\n34:49.520 --> 34:56.880\n infinities, you don't get the answers you want. And he was trying to derive now general relativity\n\n34:57.440 --> 35:03.280\n from general relativity, gravitational waves. And in doing it, he kept getting these infinities.\n\n35:04.240 --> 35:10.880\n And so he wrote a paper with Rosen that he submitted to our most important journal,\n\n35:10.880 --> 35:17.840\n Physical Review Letters. And that when it was submitted to Physical Review Letters,\n\n35:17.840 --> 35:24.400\n it was entitled, Do Gravitational Waves Exist? A very funny title to write 20 years after he\n\n35:24.400 --> 35:32.240\n proposed they exist. But it's because he had found these singularities, these infinities. And so\n\n35:32.240 --> 35:43.440\n the editor at that time, and the part of it that I don't know, is peer review. We live and die by\n\n35:43.440 --> 35:48.560\n peer review as scientists send our stuff out. We don't know when peer review actually started\n\n35:49.520 --> 35:55.520\n or what peer review Einstein ever experienced before this time. But the editor of Physical\n\n35:55.520 --> 36:02.000\n Review sent this out for review. He had a choice. He could take any article and just accept it.\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:07.760\n He could reject it, or he could send it for review. I believe the editors used to have much\n\n36:07.760 --> 36:13.360\n more power. Yeah, yeah. And he was a young man. His name was Tate. And he ended up being editor\n\n36:13.360 --> 36:22.320\n for years. So he sent this for review to a theoretical physicist named Robertson, who was\n\n36:22.320 --> 36:27.840\n also in this field of general relativity, who happened to be on sabbatical at that moment at\n\n36:27.840 --> 36:37.280\n Caltech. Otherwise, his institution was Princeton, where Einstein was. And he saw that the way they\n\n36:37.280 --> 36:42.320\n set up the problem, the infinities were like I make it as a student, because if you don't\n\n36:42.320 --> 36:48.320\n set it up right in general relativity, you get these infinities. And so he reviewed the article\n\n36:48.320 --> 36:54.640\n and gave an illustration that if they set it up in what are called cylindrical coordinates, these\n\n36:54.640 --> 37:03.280\n infinities went away. The editor of Physical Review was obviously intimidated by Einstein.\n\n37:03.280 --> 37:08.800\n He wrote this really not a letter back like I would get saying, you're screwed up in your paper\n\n37:08.800 --> 37:17.840\n instead. It was kind of, what do you think of the comments of our referee? Einstein wrote back,\n\n37:17.840 --> 37:24.640\n and it's a well documented letter, wrote back a letter to Physical Review saying, I didn't send\n\n37:24.640 --> 37:31.600\n you the paper to send it to one of your so called experts. I sent it to you to publish. I withdraw\n\n37:31.600 --> 37:42.000\n the paper. And he never published again in that journal. That was 1936. Instead, he rewrote it\n\n37:42.000 --> 37:49.920\n with the fixes that were made, changed the title and published it in what was called the Franklin\n\n37:49.920 --> 37:56.960\n Review, which is the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, which is Benjamin Franklin\n\n37:56.960 --> 38:01.920\n Institute, which doesn't have a journal now, but did at that time. So the article is published.\n\n38:01.920 --> 38:08.080\n It's the last time he ever wrote about it. It remained controversial. So it wasn't until\n\n38:08.080 --> 38:19.760\n close to 1960, 1958, where there was a conference that brought together the experts in general\n\n38:19.760 --> 38:29.360\n relativity to try to sort out whether it was true that there were gravitational waves or not.\n\n38:29.360 --> 38:40.240\n And there was a very nice derivation by a British theorist from the heart of the theory that gets\n\n38:40.240 --> 38:46.160\n gravitational waves. And that was number one. The second thing that happened at that meeting is\n\n38:46.160 --> 38:53.200\n Richard Feynman was there. And Feynman said, well, if there's typical Feynman, if there's\n\n38:53.200 --> 38:58.320\n gravitational waves, they need to be able to do something, otherwise they don't exist. So they\n\n38:58.320 --> 39:05.200\n have to be able to transfer energy. So he made an idea of a gedankenexperiment that is just a bar\n\n39:05.920 --> 39:11.120\n with a couple of rings on it. And then if a gravitational wave goes through, it distorts the\n\n39:11.120 --> 39:19.440\n bar and that creates friction on these little rings and that's heat and that's energy. So that\n\n39:19.440 --> 39:24.960\n meant... Is that a good idea? That sounds like a good idea. Yeah. It means that he showed that\n\n39:24.960 --> 39:31.440\n that with the distortion of space time, you could transfer energy just by this little idea.\n\n39:31.440 --> 39:39.360\n And it was shown theoretically. So at that point, it was believed theoretically then\n\n39:39.360 --> 39:45.440\n by people that gravitational waves should exist. No, we should be able to detect them.\n\n39:45.440 --> 39:49.200\n We should be able to detect them, except that they're very, very small.\n\n39:49.200 --> 39:54.320\n And so what kind of, there's a bunch of questions here, but what kind of events\n\n39:55.280 --> 40:01.200\n would generate gravitational waves? You have to have this, what I call quadrupole moment.\n\n40:01.200 --> 40:08.400\n That comes about if I have, for example, two objects that go around each other like this,\n\n40:08.400 --> 40:14.960\n like the earth around the sun or the moon around the earth, or in our case, it turns out to be two\n\n40:14.960 --> 40:19.680\n black holes going around each other like this. So how's that different than basic oscillation\n\n40:19.680 --> 40:24.080\n back and forth? Is it just more common in nature to have... Oscillation is a dipole moment. So it\n\n40:24.080 --> 40:27.600\n has to be in three dimensional space kind of oscillation. So you have to have something\n\n40:27.600 --> 40:32.160\n that's three dimensional that'll give what I called a quadrupole moment. That's just built\n\n40:32.160 --> 40:38.400\n into this. And luckily in nature you have stuff... And luckily things exist. And it is luckily\n\n40:38.400 --> 40:43.120\n because the effect is so small that you could say, look, I could take a barbell\n\n40:43.120 --> 40:50.640\n and spin it, right? And detect the gravitational waves. But unfortunately, no matter how much I\n\n40:50.640 --> 40:56.560\n spin it, how fast I spin it, so I know how to make gravitational waves, but they're so weak,\n\n40:56.560 --> 41:01.520\n I can't detect them. So we have to take something that's stronger than I can make. Otherwise we\n\n41:01.520 --> 41:07.040\n would do what Hertz did for electromagnetic waves. Go in our lab, take a barbell, put it on\n\n41:07.040 --> 41:13.120\n something, spin it. Can I ask a dumb question? So a single object that's weirdly shaped,\n\n41:13.120 --> 41:20.480\n does that generate gravitational waves? So if it's rotating? Sure. But it's just a much weaker signal.\n\n41:20.480 --> 41:25.680\n It's weaker. Well, we didn't know what the strongest signal would be that we would see.\n\n41:26.880 --> 41:31.040\n We targeted seeing something called neutron stars actually, because black holes we don't\n\n41:31.040 --> 41:35.680\n know very much about. It turned out we were a little bit lucky. There was a stronger source,\n\n41:35.680 --> 41:43.680\n which was the black holes. Well, another ridiculous question. So you say waves. What does a wave mean?\n\n41:43.680 --> 41:52.320\n Like the most ridiculous version of that question is, what does it feel like to ride a wave as you\n\n41:52.320 --> 42:00.320\n get closer to the source? Or experience it? Well, if you experience a wave, imagine that this is\n\n42:00.320 --> 42:06.320\n what happens to you. I don't know what you mean about getting close. It comes to you. So it's like\n\n42:06.320 --> 42:12.400\n this light wave or something that comes through you. So when a light hits you, it makes your eyes\n\n42:12.400 --> 42:20.560\n detect it. I flashed it. What does this do? It's like going to the amusement park, and they have\n\n42:20.560 --> 42:25.040\n these mirrors. You look in this mirror and you look short and fat, and the one next to you makes\n\n42:25.040 --> 42:31.840\n you tall and thin. Imagine that you went back and forth between those two mirrors once a second.\n\n42:32.560 --> 42:38.480\n That would be a gravitational wave with a period of once a second. If you did it 60 times a second,\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:43.520\n go back and forth. And then that's all that happens. It makes you taller and shorter and\n\n42:43.520 --> 42:50.320\n fatter back and forth as it goes through you at the frequency of the gravitational wave. So the\n\n42:50.320 --> 42:57.520\n frequencies that we detect are higher than one a second, but that's the idea. And the amount is\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:06.080\n small. Amount is small, but if you're closer to the source of the wave, is it the same amount?\n\n43:07.200 --> 43:14.880\n Yeah, it doesn't dissipate. It doesn't dissipate. Okay, so it's not that fun of an amusement ride.\n\n43:14.880 --> 43:22.400\n Well, it does dissipate, but it's proportional to the distance.\n\n43:22.400 --> 43:24.720\n Right. It's not a big power.\n\n43:24.720 --> 43:31.200\n Right. Gotcha. But it would be a fun ride if you get a little bit closer or a lot closer.\n\n43:31.840 --> 43:36.320\n I mean, I wonder what the... Okay, this is a ridiculous question, but I have you here.\n\n43:36.320 --> 43:44.640\n I mean, the getting fatter and taller, I mean, that experience, for some reason,\n\n43:44.640 --> 43:51.520\n that's mind blowing to me because it brings the distortion of space time to you. I mean,\n\n43:51.520 --> 43:56.000\n space time is being morphed, right? Like this is a wave.\n\n43:56.000 --> 43:56.400\n That's right.\n\n43:57.200 --> 43:59.760\n That's so weird.\n\n43:59.760 --> 44:01.200\n And we're in space, so we're affected by it.\n\n44:01.200 --> 44:03.520\n Yeah, we're in space and now it's moving.\n\n44:03.520 --> 44:06.960\n It's moving. I don't know what to do with it. I mean, does it... Okay.\n\n44:08.480 --> 44:12.560\n How much do you think about the philosophical implications of\n\n44:13.440 --> 44:19.200\n general relativity? Like that we're in space time and it can be bent by gravity.\n\n44:21.280 --> 44:27.280\n Like, is that just what it is? Are we supposed to be okay with this? Because like Newton,\n\n44:27.840 --> 44:31.120\n even Newton is a little weird, right? But that at least like makes sense.\n\n44:31.120 --> 44:37.680\n That's our physical world. When an apple falls, it makes sense. But the fact that\n\n44:37.680 --> 44:47.840\n entirety of the space time we're in can bend, that's really mind blowing.\n\n44:47.840 --> 44:49.360\n Let me make another analogy.\n\n44:49.360 --> 44:50.880\n This is a therapy session for me at this point.\n\n44:50.880 --> 44:52.880\n Yeah, right. Another analogy.\n\n44:52.880 --> 44:53.520\n Thank you.\n\n44:53.520 --> 44:56.000\n So imagine you have a trampoline.\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:56.240\n Yes.\n\n44:56.240 --> 45:00.800\n Okay. What happens if you put a marble on a trampoline? It doesn't do anything, right?\n\n45:02.240 --> 45:04.720\n No. Just a little bit, but not much.\n\n45:04.720 --> 45:07.600\n Yeah. I mean, just if I drop it, it's not going to go anywhere.\n\n45:08.320 --> 45:11.120\n Now imagine I put a bowling ball at the center of the trampoline.\n\n45:12.640 --> 45:16.640\n Now I come up to the trampoline and I put a marble on, what happens?\n\n45:18.000 --> 45:20.560\n It'll roll towards the bowling ball.\n\n45:20.560 --> 45:28.240\n Okay. All right. So what's happened is the presence of this massive object distorted the space\n\n45:28.880 --> 45:35.040\n that the trampoline did. This is the same thing that happens to the presence of the earth,\n\n45:36.080 --> 45:40.160\n the earth and the apple. The presence of the earth affects the space around it,\n\n45:40.160 --> 45:43.840\n just like the bowling ball on the trampoline.\n\n45:43.840 --> 45:47.280\n Yeah. This doesn't make me feel better. I'm referring from the perspective of an\n\n45:47.280 --> 45:55.760\n ant walking around on that trampoline. Then some guy just dropped a ball and then not only dropped\n\n45:55.760 --> 46:02.640\n the ball, right? It's not just dropping a bowling ball. It's making the ball go up and down or doing\n\n46:02.640 --> 46:08.480\n some kind of oscillation thing where it's like waves. And that's so fundamentally different from\n\n46:08.480 --> 46:13.360\n the experience on being on flatland and walking around and just finding delicious, sweet things\n\n46:13.360 --> 46:20.000\n as ant does. And it just feels like to me from a human experience perspective, completely,\n\n46:20.000 --> 46:21.680\n it's humbling. It's truly humbling.\n\n46:22.800 --> 46:25.600\n It's humbling, but we see that kind of phenomenon all the time.\n\n46:26.800 --> 46:32.240\n Let me give you another example. Imagine that you walk up to a still pond.\n\n46:32.880 --> 46:33.440\n Yes.\n\n46:33.440 --> 46:41.360\n Okay. Now I throw, you throw a rock in it, what happens? The rock goes in, sinks to the bottom,\n\n46:41.360 --> 46:48.400\n fine. And these little ripples go out and they travel out. That's exactly what happens. I mean,\n\n46:48.400 --> 46:55.440\n there's a disturbance, which is these, say, the bowling ball or black holes. And then the ripples\n\n46:55.440 --> 47:01.520\n that go out in the water, they're not, they don't have any, they don't have the rock, any part,\n\n47:01.520 --> 47:02.480\n pieces of the rock.\n\n47:02.480 --> 47:10.000\n See, the thing is, I guess what's not disturbing about that is it's a, I mean, I guess a flat\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:16.640\n two dimensional surface that's being disturbed. Like for a three dimensional surface, a three\n\n47:16.640 --> 47:19.840\n dimensional space to be disturbed feels weird.\n\n47:19.840 --> 47:23.120\n It's even worse. It's four dimensional because it's space and time.\n\n47:23.120 --> 47:23.680\n Time, yeah.\n\n47:24.880 --> 47:28.080\n So that's why you need Einstein is to make it four dimensional.\n\n47:28.080 --> 47:29.440\n To make it okay?\n\n47:29.440 --> 47:30.640\n No, to make it.\n\n47:30.640 --> 47:31.680\n To make it four dimensional?\n\n47:31.680 --> 47:32.320\n Yeah.\n\n47:32.320 --> 47:39.120\n Yeah, to take the same phenomenon and look at it in all of space and time. Anyway,\n\n47:39.120 --> 47:45.920\n luckily for you and I and all of us, the amount of distortion is incredibly small.\n\n47:47.600 --> 47:54.240\n So it turns out that if you think of space itself, now this is going to blow your mind too,\n\n47:54.240 --> 48:00.000\n if you think of space as being like a material, like this table, it's very stiff. You know,\n\n48:00.000 --> 48:06.480\n we have materials that are very pliable, materials that are very stiff. So space itself is very stiff.\n\n48:06.480 --> 48:09.520\n So when gravitational waves come through it, luckily for us,\n\n48:09.520 --> 48:14.480\n it doesn't distort it so much that it affects our ordinary life very much.\n\n48:16.240 --> 48:19.920\n No, I mean, that's great. That's great. I thought there was something bad coming.\n\n48:19.920 --> 48:24.160\n No, this is great. That's great news. So I mean, that, I mean, perhaps we evolved\n\n48:24.160 --> 48:32.800\n as life on Earth to be such that for us, this particular set of effects of gravitational waves\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:36.160\n is not that significant. Maybe that's why.\n\n48:36.160 --> 48:41.760\n It is. You probably used this effect today or yesterday.\n\n48:41.760 --> 48:42.320\n Did what?\n\n48:42.960 --> 48:45.440\n So it's pervasive. Well, because...\n\n48:45.440 --> 48:49.440\n You mean gravity or the way, or external? Because I only...\n\n48:49.440 --> 48:50.720\n Curvature of space and time.\n\n48:50.720 --> 48:56.000\n Curvature of space. How? I only care, a person is a human, right? The gravity of Earth.\n\n48:56.000 --> 48:58.000\n But you use it every day, almost.\n\n48:59.360 --> 49:00.240\n Oh, it's curving.\n\n49:00.240 --> 49:00.720\n Uh huh.\n\n49:00.720 --> 49:01.760\n No, no, no.\n\n49:01.760 --> 49:06.560\n No, no, no. It's in this thing. Every time it tells you where you are,\n\n49:07.840 --> 49:11.520\n how does it tell you where you are? It tells you where you are because we have\n\n49:11.520 --> 49:18.240\n 24 satellites or some number that are going around in space and it asks how long it takes\n\n49:18.240 --> 49:24.320\n the beam to go to the satellite and come back, the signal, to different ones.\n\n49:24.320 --> 49:28.560\n And then it triangulates and tells you where you are. And then if you go down the road,\n\n49:28.560 --> 49:32.880\n it tells you where you are. Do you know that if you did that with the satellites and you\n\n49:32.880 --> 49:34.800\n didn't use Einstein's equations?\n\n49:34.800 --> 49:35.280\n Oh no.\n\n49:36.560 --> 49:42.400\n You won't get the right answer. That's right. And in fact, if you take a road that's, say,\n\n49:42.400 --> 49:46.640\n 10 meters wide, I've done these numbers, and you ask how long you'd stay on the road if\n\n49:46.640 --> 49:52.160\n you didn't make the correction for general relativity, this thing you're poo pooing,\n\n49:52.160 --> 49:56.400\n because you're using every day, you'd go off the road in about a minute.\n\n49:56.400 --> 49:57.200\n Well, actually, that might be my problem.\n\n49:57.200 --> 50:00.480\n So you use it. So don't poo poo it.\n\n50:00.480 --> 50:04.320\n Well, I think I'm using an Android, so maybe, and the GPS doesn't work that well, so maybe\n\n50:04.320 --> 50:11.280\n I'm using Newton's physics. So I need to upgrade to general relativity. So gravitational waves\n\n50:11.280 --> 50:16.720\n and Einstein had, wait, Feynman really does have a part in the story?\n\n50:16.720 --> 50:17.280\n Yeah.\n\n50:17.280 --> 50:22.080\n Was that one of the first kind of experimental proposed to detect gravitational waves?\n\n50:22.080 --> 50:25.360\n Well, he did what we call a Godonkin experiment. That's a thought experiment.\n\n50:25.360 --> 50:25.680\n Yes.\n\n50:25.680 --> 50:31.760\n Okay. Not a real experiment. But then after that, then people believe gravitational waves\n\n50:31.760 --> 50:37.280\n must exist. You can kind of calculate how big they are. They're tiny. And so people\n\n50:37.280 --> 50:43.520\n started searching. The first idea that was used was Feynman's idea, and the very end of it.\n\n50:44.080 --> 50:51.360\n And it was to take a great big, huge bar of aluminum and then put around, and it's made\n\n50:51.360 --> 50:57.360\n like a cylinder, and then put around it some very, very sensitive detectors so that if a\n\n50:57.360 --> 51:03.760\n gravitational wave happened to go through it, it would go, and you'd detect this extra strain\n\n51:03.760 --> 51:10.080\n that was there. And that was this method that was used until we came along. It wasn't a very\n\n51:10.080 --> 51:11.120\n good method to use.\n\n51:12.160 --> 51:16.960\n And what was the, so we're talking about a pretty weak signal here.\n\n51:16.960 --> 51:19.280\n Yeah, that's why that method didn't work.\n\n51:19.280 --> 51:25.200\n So what, can you tell the story of figuring out what kind of method would be able to detect\n\n51:26.480 --> 51:28.640\n this very weak signal of gravitational waves?\n\n51:30.080 --> 51:38.320\n So remembering what happens when you go to the amusement park, that it's going to do something\n\n51:38.320 --> 51:44.400\n like stretch this way and squash that way, squash this way and stretch this way. We do\n\n51:44.400 --> 51:49.600\n have an instrument that can detect that kind of thing. It's called an interferometer.\n\n51:50.880 --> 51:58.720\n And what it does is it just basically takes, usually light, and the two directions that\n\n51:58.720 --> 52:03.680\n we're talking about, you send light down one direction and the perpendicular direction.\n\n52:04.240 --> 52:10.720\n And if nothing changes, it takes the same, and the arms are the same length, it just\n\n52:10.720 --> 52:16.080\n goes down, bounces back. And if you invert one compared to the other, they cancel so\n\n52:16.080 --> 52:17.040\n that nothing happens.\n\n52:17.680 --> 52:24.080\n But if it's like the amusement park and one of the arms got shorter and fatter, so it\n\n52:24.080 --> 52:30.480\n took longer to go horizontally than it did to go vertically, then when the light comes\n\n52:30.480 --> 52:37.280\n back, that comes back somewhat out of time. And that basically is the scheme. The only\n\n52:37.280 --> 52:44.880\n problem is that that's not done very accurately in general, and we had to do it extremely\n\n52:44.880 --> 52:45.840\n accurately.\n\n52:45.840 --> 52:52.160\n So what's the difficulty of doing so accurately?\n\n52:52.160 --> 53:00.960\n Okay. So the measurement that we have to do is a distortion in time. How big is it? It's\n\n53:00.960 --> 53:07.840\n a distortion that's one part in 10 to the 21. That's 21 zeros and a one. Okay.\n\n53:08.720 --> 53:11.440\n So this is like a delay in the thing coming back?\n\n53:13.520 --> 53:17.920\n One of them coming back after the other one, but the difference is just one part in 10\n\n53:17.920 --> 53:26.560\n to the 21. So for that reason, we make it big, let the arms be long. Okay, so one part\n\n53:26.560 --> 53:33.040\n in 10 to the 21. In our case, it's kilometers long. So we have an instrument that's kilometers\n\n53:33.040 --> 53:34.880\n in one direction, kilometers in the other.\n\n53:34.880 --> 53:37.360\n How many kilometers are we talking about? Four kilometers.\n\n53:37.360 --> 53:44.640\n Four kilometers in each direction. If you take then one part in 10 to the 21, we're\n\n53:44.640 --> 53:51.040\n talking about measuring something to 10 to the minus 18 meters.\n\n53:54.720 --> 53:55.040\n Okay.\n\n53:55.040 --> 54:01.520\n Now, to tell you how small that is, the proton thing we're made of, which you can't go\n\n54:01.520 --> 54:07.200\n and grab so easily, is 10 to the minus 15 meters. So this is one one thousandth the\n\n54:07.200 --> 54:13.920\n size of a proton. That's the size of the effect. Einstein himself didn't think this\n\n54:13.920 --> 54:19.760\n could be measured. We've never seen, actually, he said that. But that's because he didn't\n\n54:19.760 --> 54:25.520\n anticipate modern lasers and techniques that we developed.\n\n54:27.200 --> 54:33.520\n Okay. So maybe can you tell me a little bit what you're referring to as LIGO, the Laser\n\n54:34.240 --> 54:40.560\n Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory. What is LIGO? Can you just elaborate kind\n\n54:40.560 --> 54:44.160\n of the big picture view here before I ask you specific questions about it?\n\n54:44.160 --> 54:54.400\n Yeah. So in the same idea that I just said, we have two long vacuum pipes, four kilometers\n\n54:54.400 --> 55:03.200\n long. We start with a laser beam and we divide the beam going down the two arms. And we have\n\n55:03.200 --> 55:09.920\n a mirror at the other end, reflects it back. It's more subtle, but we bring it back. If\n\n55:09.920 --> 55:14.800\n there's no distortion in space time and the lengths are exactly the same, which we calibrate\n\n55:14.800 --> 55:20.720\n them to be, then when it comes back, if we just invert one signal compared to the other,\n\n55:20.720 --> 55:26.800\n they'll just cancel. So we see nothing. Okay. But if one arm got a little bit longer than\n\n55:26.800 --> 55:31.760\n the other, then they don't come back at exactly the same time. They don't exactly cancel.\n\n55:31.760 --> 55:42.320\n That's what we measure. So to give a number to it, we have the change of length to be\n\n55:42.320 --> 55:48.480\n able to do this 10 to the minus 18 meters to one part in 10 to the 12th. And that was\n\n55:48.480 --> 55:55.920\n the big experimental challenge that required a lot of innovation to be able to do.\n\n55:55.920 --> 56:02.560\n You gave a lot of credit to, I think, Caltech and MIT for some of the technical developments\n\n56:02.560 --> 56:10.240\n within this project. Is there some interesting things you can speak to at the low level of\n\n56:10.240 --> 56:17.600\n some cool stuff that had to be solved? I'm a software engineer, so I have so much more\n\n56:17.600 --> 56:25.440\n respect for everything done here than anything I've ever done. So I'll give you an example\n\n56:25.440 --> 56:35.840\n of doing mechanical engineering at a better, basically mechanical engineering and geology\n\n56:35.840 --> 56:42.480\n and maybe at a level. So what's the problem? The problem is the following, that I've given\n\n56:42.480 --> 56:47.920\n you this picture of an instrument that by some magic, I can make good enough to measure\n\n56:47.920 --> 56:54.000\n this very short distance. But then I put it down here, it won't work. And the reason it\n\n56:54.000 --> 56:59.600\n doesn't work is that the Earth itself is moving all over the place all the time. You don't\n\n56:59.600 --> 57:05.680\n realize it, it seems pretty good to you, but it's moving all the time. So somehow it's\n\n57:05.680 --> 57:10.320\n moving so much that we can't deal with it. We happen to be trying to do the experiment\n\n57:10.320 --> 57:16.160\n here on Earth, but we can't deal with it. So we have to make the instrument isolated\n\n57:16.160 --> 57:23.040\n from the Earth at the frequencies we're at. We've got to float it. That's an engineering\n\n57:23.040 --> 57:24.720\n problem, not a physics problem.\n\n57:24.720 --> 57:32.160\n So we're having a conversation on a podcast right now, and people who record music work\n\n57:32.160 --> 57:38.080\n with this, how to create an isolated room. And they usually build a room within a room,\n\n57:39.040 --> 57:43.200\n but that's still not isolated. In fact, they say it's impossible to truly isolate from\n\n57:43.200 --> 57:51.760\n sound, from noise and stuff like that. But that's like one step of millions that you\n\n57:51.760 --> 57:56.800\n took is building a room inside a room, because you basically have to isolate all.\n\n57:56.800 --> 58:02.000\n No, this is actually an easier problem. You just have to do it really well. So making\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:07.920\n a clean room is really a tough problem because you have to put a room inside a room. This\n\n58:07.920 --> 58:14.080\n is really simple engineering or physics. Okay, so what do you have to do? How do you isolate\n\n58:14.080 --> 58:21.600\n yourself from the Earth? First, we work at, we're not looking at all frequencies for\n\n58:21.600 --> 58:26.560\n gravitational waves. We're looking at particular frequencies that you can deal with here on\n\n58:26.560 --> 58:31.760\n Earth. So what are frequencies would those be? You were just talking about frequencies.\n\n58:34.000 --> 58:40.800\n We know by evolution, our bodies know, it's the audio band. Okay, the reason our ears\n\n58:40.800 --> 58:45.040\n work where they work is that's where the Earth isn't going, making too much noise.\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:48.720\n Okay, so the reason our ears work the way they work is because this is where it's quiet.\n\n58:48.720 --> 58:59.520\n That's right. So if you go to one Hertz instead of 10 Hertz, the Earth is really moving around.\n\n58:59.520 --> 59:06.320\n So somehow we live in what we call the audio band. It's tens of Hertz to thousands of Hertz.\n\n59:06.320 --> 59:14.000\n That's where we live, okay? If we're going to do an experiment on the Earth, it's the\n\n59:14.000 --> 59:18.000\n same frequency. That's where the Earth is the quietest. So we have to work in that frequency.\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:25.440\n So we're not looking at all frequencies, okay? So the solution for the shaking of the Earth\n\n59:25.440 --> 59:33.840\n to get rid of it is pretty mundane if we do the same thing that you do to make your car drive\n\n59:33.840 --> 59:39.760\n smoothly down the road. So what happens when your car goes over a bump? Early cars did that,\n\n59:39.760 --> 59:41.280\n they bounced. Right.\n\n59:41.280 --> 59:47.120\n Okay, but you don't feel that in your car. So what happened to that energy? You can't just\n\n59:47.120 --> 59:53.040\n disappear energy. So we have these things called shock absorbers in the car. What they do is they\n\n59:53.840 --> 59:58.880\n take the thing that went like that, and they basically can't get rid of the energy, but they\n\n59:58.880 --> 1:00:08.560\n move it to very, very low frequency. So what you feel isn't, you feel it go smoothly, okay? All\n\n1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:18.080\n right. So we also work at this frequency. So we basically, why don't we have to do anything other\n\n1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:26.400\n than shock absorbers? So we made the world's fanciest shock absorbers, okay? Not just like in\n\n1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:30.480\n your car where there's one layer of them. They're just the right squishiness and so forth. They're\n\n1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:35.760\n better than what's in the cars. And we have four layers of it. So whatever shakes and gets through\n\n1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:40.880\n the first layer, we treat it in a second, third, fourth layer. So it's a mechanical engineering\n\n1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:46.640\n problem. Yeah, that's what I said. So it's not, there's no weird tricks to it, like a chemistry\n\n1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.840\n type thing. No, no. Just, well, the right squishiness, you need the right material inside.\n\n1:00:51.840 --> 1:00:58.720\n And ours look like little springs, but they're. Springs? They're springs? So like legitimately,\n\n1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:06.640\n like shock absorbers. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. And this is now experimental physics at the,\n\n1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:11.120\n at its limit. Okay. So you do this and we make the world's fanciest shock absorbers,\n\n1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:16.800\n just mechanical engineering. Just mechanical engineering, this is hilarious. But we didn't,\n\n1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:25.360\n we weren't good enough to discover gravitational waves. So we did another, we added another\n\n1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:33.920\n feature and it's something else that you're aware of, probably have one. And that is to get rid of\n\n1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:40.160\n noise. You've probably noise, which is, you don't like. And that's the same principle that's in\n\n1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:48.240\n these little Bose earphones. Noise canceling? Noise canceling. So how do they work? They\n\n1:01:48.240 --> 1:01:53.600\n basically, you go on an airplane and they sense the ambient noise from the engines\n\n1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:59.360\n and cancel it. Cause it's just the same over and over again. They cancel it. And when the stewardess\n\n1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:03.760\n comes and asks you whether you want coffee or tea or a drink or something, you hear, you're fine\n\n1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.040\n because she's not ambient. She's the signal. So. Are we talking about active canceling? Like where\n\n1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:16.160\n are the. Active canceling. So. This is, okay. So another. Don't tell me you have active canceling\n\n1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:22.480\n on this. Yeah. Besides the shock absorbers. So we had this, so inside this array of shock absorbers.\n\n1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:29.600\n Yeah. We, you asked for some interesting. This is awesome. So inside this, it's harder than the,\n\n1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:34.880\n the earphone problem, but it's just engineering. We have to see measure, not just that the\n\n1:02:36.320 --> 1:02:42.880\n engine still made noise, but the earth is shaking. It's moving in some direction. So we have to\n\n1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:48.240\n actually tell not only that there's noise and cancel it, but what direction it's from. So we\n\n1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:57.840\n put this array of seismometers inside this array of shock absorbers and measure the residual motion\n\n1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:05.040\n and its direction. And we put little actuators that push back against it and cancel it.\n\n1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:11.920\n This is awesome. So you have the actuators and you have the thing that is sensing the,\n\n1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:16.080\n the vibrations and then you have the actual actuators that adjust for that and do so in\n\n1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:22.080\n perfect synchrony. Yeah. What if it all works right. And so how much do we reduce the shaking\n\n1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:31.440\n of the earth? I mean, one part in 10 to the 12th. One part in 10. So what gets through us is one\n\n1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:39.040\n part in 10 to the 12th. That's pretty big reduction. You don't need that in your car,\n\n1:03:39.040 --> 1:03:43.200\n but that's what we do. And so that's how isolated we are from the earth. And that was the biggest,\n\n1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:49.040\n and that was the biggest, I'd say technical problem outside of the physics instrument,\n\n1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:54.480\n the interferometer. Can I ask you a weird question here? You make it very poetically\n\n1:03:54.480 --> 1:04:00.000\n and humorously is saying it's just a mechanical engineering problem, but is this one of the\n\n1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:09.760\n biggest precision mechanical engineering efforts ever? I mean, this seems exceptionally difficult.\n\n1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:16.960\n It is. And so it took a long time. And I think nobody seems to challenge the statement that\n\n1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:21.360\n this is the most precision, precise instrument it's ever been built, LIGO.\n\n1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:25.680\n I wonder what like listening to Led Zeppelin sounds on this thing,\n\n1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:30.080\n because it's so isolated. I mean, this is like, I don't know.\n\n1:04:30.080 --> 1:04:37.520\n No background. No, no back. It's wow. Wow. Wow. So when you were first\n\n1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:44.240\n conceiving this, I would probably, if I was knowledgeable enough,\n\n1:04:44.240 --> 1:04:48.080\n kind of laugh off the possibility that this is even possible.\n\n1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:54.880\n I'm sure, like how many people believe that this is possible? Did you believe this is possible?\n\n1:04:54.880 --> 1:05:00.320\n I did. I didn't know that we needed, for sure that we needed active. When we started,\n\n1:05:00.320 --> 1:05:08.320\n we did dispassive, but we were doing the tests to develop the active to add as a second stage,\n\n1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:15.680\n which we ended up needing. But there was a lot of, you know, now there was a lot of skepticism.\n\n1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:20.400\n A lot of us, especially astronomers, felt that money was being wasted,\n\n1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:26.160\n because we were also expensive. Doing what I told you is not cheap. So it was kind of\n\n1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:32.240\n controversial. It was funded by the National Science Foundation. Can you just linger on this\n\n1:05:32.240 --> 1:05:41.280\n just for a little longer? The actuator thing, the act of canceling. Do you remember like little\n\n1:05:41.280 --> 1:05:46.720\n experiments that were done along the way to prove to the team themselves that this is even possible?\n\n1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:54.080\n Because I work with quite a bit of robots, and to me, the idea that you could do it this precisely\n\n1:05:54.080 --> 1:06:01.520\n is humbling and embarrassing, frankly. Because like, this is another level of precision that I\n\n1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:10.960\n can't even, because robots are a mess. And this is basically one of the most precise robots ever.\n\n1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:18.240\n Right. So like, is there, do you have any like small scale experiments that were done that just\n\n1:06:18.240 --> 1:06:27.040\n be like, this is possible? Yeah, and larger scale. We made a test, that also has to be in vacuum too,\n\n1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:33.280\n but we made test chambers that had this system in it, our first mock of this system, so we could test\n\n1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:41.040\n it and optimize it and make it work. But it's just a mechanical engineering problem. Okay.\n\n1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:49.280\n And humans are just ape descendants. I gotcha. I gotcha. Is there any video of this? Like some kind\n\n1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:56.160\n of educational purpose visualizations of this act of canceling? I don't think so.\n\n1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:04.560\n I mean, does this live on? Well, we work for parts of it, for the active canceling,\n\n1:07:04.560 --> 1:07:11.680\n we worked with, for the instruments, for the sensor and instruments, we worked with a small\n\n1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:17.600\n company near where you are, because it was our MIT people that got them that were, you know,\n\n1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:21.680\n interested in the problem because they thought they might be able to commercialize it for\n\n1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:28.400\n making stable tables to make microelectronics, for example, which are limited by how stable the table\n\n1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:35.200\n is. I mean, at this point, it's a little expensive. So you never know, never know where this leads.\n\n1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:45.200\n So maybe on the, let me ask you, just sticking it a little longer, this silly old mechanical\n\n1:07:45.200 --> 1:07:53.520\n engineering problem. What was to you kind of the darkest moment of what was the hardest\n\n1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.320\n stumbling block to get over on the engineer side? Like, was there any time where there's a doubt,\n\n1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:03.920\n where it's like, I'm not sure we would be able to do this, a kind of engineering challenge that was\n\n1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:11.680\n hit? Do you remember anything like that? I think the one that my colleague at MIT,\n\n1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:18.720\n Ray Weiss, worked on so hard and was much more of a worry than this. This is only a question if you're\n\n1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:26.400\n not doing well enough, you have to keep making it better somehow. But this whole huge instrument has\n\n1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:34.720\n to be in vacuum. And the vacuum tanks are, you know, this big around. And so it's the world's\n\n1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:42.720\n biggest high vacuum system. And how do you make it? First of all, how do you make this four meter\n\n1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.640\n long sealed vacuum system? It has to be made out of four kilometers, four kilometers long. Would I\n\n1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:55.360\n say something else? Meters. Four kilometers long. Big difference. Yeah. And so, but to make it,\n\n1:08:55.360 --> 1:09:04.480\n yeah, we started with a roll of stainless steel, and then we roll it out like a spiral so that\n\n1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:14.160\n there's a spiral weld on it. Okay, so the engineering was fine. We did that. We worked through\n\n1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:23.520\n very good companies and so forth to build it. But the big worry was, what if you develop a leak?\n\n1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:31.200\n This is a high vacuum, not just vacuum system. Typically, in a laboratory, if there's a leak,\n\n1:09:31.200 --> 1:09:40.000\n you put helium around the thing you have, and then you detect where the helium is coming in.\n\n1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:44.080\n But if you have something as big as this, you can't surround it with helium. So you might not\n\n1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:51.280\n actually even know that there's a leak and it will be affecting it. Well, we can measure how\n\n1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:58.080\n good the vacuum is so we can know that, but a leak can develop and then we don't, how do we fix it\n\n1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:04.880\n or how do we find it? And so that was, you asked about a worry. That was always a really big worry.\n\n1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:10.960\n What's the difference, you know, high vacuum and a vacuum? What is high vacuum? That's like some\n\n1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:20.640\n delta close to vacuum? Is it some threshold? Well, there's a unit. High vacuum is when the vacuum\n\n1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:27.040\n and the units that are used, which are tors, there's 10 to the minus nine. And there's high\n\n1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:35.600\n vacuum is usually used in small places. The biggest vacuum system period is at CERN in this\n\n1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:40.080\n big particle accelerator, but the high vacuum where they need really good vacuum so particles\n\n1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:47.520\n don't scatter in it is smaller than ours. So ours is a really large high vacuum system.\n\n1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:53.600\n I don't know. This is so cool. I mean, this is basically by far the greatest listening device\n\n1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:59.680\n ever built by human. The fact that like descendants of apes could do this, that evolution started with\n\n1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:07.200\n single cell organisms. I mean, is there any more, I'm a huge theory is like, yeah, yeah. But like\n\n1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:11.360\n bridges, when I look at bridges from a civil engineering perspective, it's one of the most\n\n1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:17.200\n beautiful creations by human beings. It's physics. You're using physics to construct objects that\n\n1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.760\n can support huge amount of mass and it's like structural, but it's also beautiful.\n\n1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:26.480\n And that humans can collaborate to create that throughout history. And then you take this\n\n1:11:26.480 --> 1:11:35.040\n on another level. This is, this is like, it's exciting to me beyond measure that humans can\n\n1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:41.600\n create something so precise. But another concept lost in this, you just said, you started talking\n\n1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:47.120\n about single cell. Yeah. Okay. You have to realize this discovery that we made that everybody's\n\n1:11:47.120 --> 1:11:55.360\n bought off on happened 1.3 billion years ago, somewhere. And then the signal came to us 1.3\n\n1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:00.880\n billion years ago, we were just converting on the earth from single cell to multi cell life.\n\n1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:07.360\n So when this actually happened, this collision of two black holes, we weren't here. We weren't\n\n1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:14.000\n even close to developing single. Yeah, we were had, we're going from single cell to multi cell\n\n1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:20.720\n life at that point. All to meet up at this, at this point. Yeah. Wow. That's like, that's almost\n\n1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:32.560\n romantic. It is. Okay. So on the human side of things, it's kind of fascinating because you're\n\n1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:39.040\n talking about over a thousand people team for LIGO. Yeah. They started out with, you know,\n\n1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:48.400\n around a hundred and you've for parts of the time at least led this team. What does it take to lead\n\n1:12:48.400 --> 1:12:56.160\n a team like this of incredibly brilliant theoreticians and engineers and just a lot of\n\n1:12:56.160 --> 1:13:03.200\n different parties involved? A lot of egos, a lot of ideas. You had this fun, funny example,\n\n1:13:03.200 --> 1:13:10.720\n I forget where, where in publishing a paper, you have to all agree on like, you know, the phrasing\n\n1:13:10.720 --> 1:13:15.040\n of a certain sentence or the title of the paper and so on. That's a very interesting, simple\n\n1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:20.080\n example. I'd love you to speak to that, but just in general, how, what does it take to lead this\n\n1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:28.800\n kind of team? Okay. I think that the general idea is one we all know. You want to, you want to,\n\n1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:37.040\n you want to get where the, the sum of something is more than the individual parts is what we say,\n\n1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:42.640\n right? Yeah. So that's what you're trying to achieve. Yes. Okay. How do you do that? Actually,\n\n1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:49.280\n mostly if we take multiple objects or people, I mean, you put them together, the sum is less.\n\n1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:56.400\n Yes. Why? Because they overlap. So you don't have individual things that, you know, this\n\n1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:02.320\n person does that, this person does that, then you get exactly the sum. But what you want is to\n\n1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:07.120\n develop where you get more than what the individual contributions are. We know that's\n\n1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:14.160\n very common. People use that expression everywhere. And it's the expression that has to be kind of\n\n1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:21.440\n built into how people feel it's working. Because if you're part of a team, and you realize that\n\n1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:27.440\n somehow the team is able to do more than the individuals could do themselves, then they buy on\n\n1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:36.000\n kind of in terms of the process. So that's the, that's the goal that you have to have is to, to\n\n1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:45.840\n achieve that. And that means that you have to realize parts of what you're trying to do that\n\n1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:52.240\n require not that one person couldn't do it, it requires the combined talents to be able to do\n\n1:14:52.240 --> 1:14:57.200\n something that neither of them could do themselves. And we have a lot of that kind of thing. And I\n\n1:14:57.200 --> 1:15:06.320\n think, I mean, build into the some of the examples that I gave you. And so, how do you then, so, so\n\n1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:12.400\n the key almost in anything you do is the people themselves, right? So in our case,\n\n1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:20.880\n the first and most important was to attract to spend years of their life on this. And the best\n\n1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:27.200\n possible people in the world to do it. So the only way to convince them is that somehow it's\n\n1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:34.080\n better and more interesting for them than what they could do themselves. And so that's part of\n\n1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:42.240\n this idea. Yeah, that's powerful. But nevertheless, there's best people in the world, there's egos. Is\n\n1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:47.840\n there something to be said about managing egos? Oh, that's the human problem is always the hardest.\n\n1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:56.080\n And so there's, that's an art, not a science, I think. I think the fact here that combined,\n\n1:15:56.080 --> 1:16:06.240\n there's a was a romantic goal that we had to, you know, do something that people hadn't done before,\n\n1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:19.600\n which was important scientifically and, and a huge challenge, enabled us to say, take and get, I mean,\n\n1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:24.320\n what we did just to take an example, we use the light to go in this thing comes from lasers.\n\n1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:30.960\n We need a certain kind of laser. So the kind of laser that we use, there were three different\n\n1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:37.520\n institutions in the world that had the experts that do this, maybe in competition with each other.\n\n1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:45.040\n So we got all three to join together and work with us to work on this as an example. So that\n\n1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:51.680\n you had, and they had the thing that they were working together on a kind of object that they\n\n1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:57.280\n wouldn't have otherwise. And we're part of a bigger team where they could discover something\n\n1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:03.520\n that isn't even engineers. These are engineers that do laser. So, and they're part of our laser\n\n1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:14.480\n physicists. So could you describe the moment or the period of time when finally this incredible\n\n1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:22.160\n creation of human beings led to a detection of gravitational waves? It's a long story. Unfortunately,\n\n1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:28.560\n this is a part that we started failures along the way kind of thing or all failures. That's all\n\n1:17:28.560 --> 1:17:36.080\n that's built into it. If you're not, if you're not mechanical engineering, you build on your failures,\n\n1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:41.360\n that's expected. So we're trying things that no one's done before. So it's technically not just\n\n1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:48.480\n gravitational waves. And so it's built on failures. But anyway, we did before me, even\n\n1:17:48.480 --> 1:17:57.920\n there, the people did R&D on the concepts. But starting in 1994, we got money from the National\n\n1:17:57.920 --> 1:18:06.240\n Science Foundation to build this thing. It took about five years to build it. So by 1999, we had\n\n1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:13.920\n built the basic unit. It did not have active seismic isolation at that stage, didn't have some\n\n1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:26.960\n other things that we have now. What we did at the beginning was stick to technologies that we had\n\n1:18:27.360 --> 1:18:33.840\n at least enough knowledge that we could make work or had tested in our own laboratories. And so then\n\n1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:41.040\n we put together the instrument. We made it work. It didn't work very well, but it worked. And we\n\n1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:45.600\n didn't see any gravitational waves. Then we figured out what limited us. And we went through this\n\n1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:55.520\n every year for almost 10 years, never seeing gravitational waves. We would run it, looking for\n\n1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:06.320\n gravitational waves for months, learn what limited us, fix it for months, and then run it again.\n\n1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:13.280\n Eventually, we knew we had to take another big step. And that's when we made several changes,\n\n1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:21.600\n including adding these active seismic isolation, which turned out to be a key. And we\n\n1:19:21.600 --> 1:19:27.520\n fortunately got the National Science Foundation to give us another couple hundred million dollars,\n\n1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:42.080\n 100 million more. And we rebuild it or fixed or improved it. And then in 2015, we turned it on.\n\n1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:50.560\n And we almost instantly saw this first collision of two black holes.\n\n1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:58.560\n And then we went through a process of, do we believe what we've seen?\n\n1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:02.400\n Yeah, I think you're one of the people that went through that process. It sounds like some people\n\n1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:05.600\n immediately believed it. And then you're like...\n\n1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:10.080\n So as human beings, we all have different reactions to almost anything. And so\n\n1:20:10.080 --> 1:20:20.160\n quite a few of my colleagues had a eureka moment immediately. I mean, the figure that we put in our\n\n1:20:20.160 --> 1:20:27.840\n paper, first is just data. We didn't have to go through fancy computer programs to do anything.\n\n1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:36.080\n And we show next to it the calculations of Einstein's equations. It looks just like what\n\n1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:42.000\n we detected. And we did it in two different detectors halfway across the US. So it was\n\n1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:53.920\n pretty convincing, but you don't want to fool yourself. So being a scientist, for me, we had\n\n1:20:53.920 --> 1:20:58.000\n to go through and try to understand that the instrument itself, which was new, I said we had\n\n1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:06.240\n rebuild it, couldn't somehow generate things that look like this. That took some tests. And then the\n\n1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:12.080\n second, you'll appreciate more, we had to somehow convince ourselves we weren't hacked in some\n\n1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:12.800\n clever way.\n\n1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:14.320\n Cybersecurity question.\n\n1:21:14.320 --> 1:21:18.000\n Yeah. Even though we're not on the internet, but...\n\n1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:23.520\n Yeah. No, it can be physical access too. Yeah. That's fascinating. It's fascinating that you\n\n1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:34.560\n would think about that. I mean, not enough. I mean, because it matches prediction. So the chances\n\n1:21:34.560 --> 1:21:38.320\n of it actually being manipulated is very, very low. But nevertheless...\n\n1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:42.800\n We still could have disgruntled all the graduate students who had worked with us earlier that...\n\n1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:48.880\n Who want you to... I don't know how that's supposed to embarrass you. I suppose, yeah. I suppose I\n\n1:21:48.880 --> 1:21:55.360\n see. But about what I think you said, within a month, you kind of convinced yourself officially.\n\n1:21:55.360 --> 1:22:01.520\n Within a month, we convinced ourselves. We kept a thousand collaborators quiet during that time.\n\n1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:10.080\n Then we spent another month or so trying to understand what we'd seen so that we could do the\n\n1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:14.480\n science with it instead of just putting it out to the world and let somebody else understand that it\n\n1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:19.680\n was two black holes and what it was. The fact that a thousand collaborators were quiet\n\n1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:25.600\n is a really strong indication that this is a really close knit team. Yeah. And they're around\n\n1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:35.200\n the world. Either strong knit or tight knit or had a strong dictatorship or something. Yeah.\n\n1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:39.120\n Either fear or love. You can rule by fear or love. Yeah, right. You can go back to Machiavelli.\n\n1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:51.760\n Yeah. All right. Well, this is really exciting that that's a success story because it didn't\n\n1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:56.720\n have to be a success story, right? I mean, eventually, perhaps you could say it'll be an\n\n1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:06.160\n event, but it could have taken over a century to get there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it's only downhill\n\n1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:18.240\n now. What do you mean? You mean with gravitational waves? Yeah. Well, now we're off because of the\n\n1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:25.120\n pandemic, but when we turned off, we were seeing some sort of gravitational wave event each week.\n\n1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:32.560\n Now we're fixing, we're adding features where it'll probably be when we turn back on next year,\n\n1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:37.520\n it'll probably be one every couple days. And they're not all the same. So it's\n\n1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:45.840\n learning about what's out there in gravity instead of just optics. So it's all great.\n\n1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:54.880\n We're only limited by the fantastic thing other than that this is a great field and it's all new\n\n1:23:54.880 --> 1:24:04.000\n and so forth is that experimentally, the great thing is that we're limited by technology and\n\n1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:16.400\n technical limitations, not by science. So another really important discovery that was made before\n\n1:24:16.400 --> 1:24:23.200\n ours was what's called the Higgs boson made on the big accelerator at CERN. This huge accelerator,\n\n1:24:23.200 --> 1:24:29.360\n they discovered a really important thing. We have Einstein's equation, E equals MC squared.\n\n1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:37.040\n So energy makes mass or mass can make energy and that's the bomb. But the mechanism by which that\n\n1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:48.560\n happens, not vision, but how do you create mass from energy was never understood until there was\n\n1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:58.400\n a theory of it about 70 years ago now. And so they discovered it's named after a man named Higgs.\n\n1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:05.120\n It's called the Higgs boson. And so it was discovered, but since that time, and I worked\n\n1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:09.920\n on those experiments since that time, they haven't been able to progress very much further,\n\n1:25:09.920 --> 1:25:14.240\n a little bit, but not a lot further. And the difference is that we're really lucky\n\n1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:22.880\n we're in what we're doing in that there you see this Higgs boson, but there's tremendous amount\n\n1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:28.080\n of other physics that goes on and you have to pick out the needle in the haystack of physics.\n\n1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:34.480\n You can't make the physics go away, it's there. In our case, we have a very weak signal, but once we\n\n1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:40.080\n get good enough to see it, it's weak compared to where we've reduced the background, but the\n\n1:25:40.080 --> 1:25:47.600\n background is not physics, it's just technology. It's getting ourselves better isolated from the\n\n1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:56.160\n Earth or getting a more powerful laser. And so since 2015, when we saw the first one,\n\n1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:03.040\n we continually can make improvements that are enabling us to turn this into a real science\n\n1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:12.560\n to do astronomy, a new kind of astronomy. It's a little like astronomy. Galileo started the field.\n\n1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:20.080\n He basically took lenses that were made for classes and he didn't invent the first telescope,\n\n1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:28.880\n but made a telescope, looked at Neptune and saw that it had four moons. That was the birth of\n\n1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:34.880\n not just using your eyes to understand what's out there. And since that time, we've made better and\n\n1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:41.920\n better telescopes, obviously, and astronomy thrives. And in a similar way, we're starting to\n\n1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:49.920\n be able to crawl, but we're starting to be able to do that with gravitational waves. And it's\n\n1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:55.600\n going to be more and more that we can do as we can make better and better instruments because,\n\n1:26:55.600 --> 1:27:02.400\n as I say, it's not limited by picking it out of others. Yeah, it's not limited by the physics.\n\n1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:10.080\n So you have an optimism about engineering that as human progress marches on,\n\n1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:17.280\n engineering will always find a way to build a large enough device,\n\n1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:21.360\n accurate enough device to detect the same thing. As long as it's not limited by physics,\n\n1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:34.720\n yeah, they'll do it. So you, two other folks and the entire team won the Nobel prize for this big\n\n1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:49.680\n effort. There's a million questions I can ask for, but looking back, where does the Nobel prize\n\n1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:57.920\n fit into all of this? If you think hundreds of years from now, I venture to say that people\n\n1:27:57.920 --> 1:28:03.360\n will not remember the winners of a prize, but they'll remember creations like these.\n\n1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:10.880\n Maybe I'm romanticizing engineering, but I guess I want to ask how important is the Nobel prize in\n\n1:28:10.880 --> 1:28:22.240\n all of this? Well, that's a complicated question. As a physicist, it's something if you're trying\n\n1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:30.960\n to win a Nobel prize, forget it because they give one a year. So there's been 200 physicists\n\n1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:40.240\n who have won the Nobel prize since 1900. And so things just have to fall right. So your goal cannot\n\n1:28:40.240 --> 1:28:51.600\n be to win a Nobel prize. It wasn't my dream. It's tremendous for science. Why the Nobel prize for a\n\n1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:58.400\n guy that made dynamite and stuff is what it is. It's a long story, but it's the one day a year\n\n1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:04.720\n where actually the science that people have done is all over the world and so forth. Forget about\n\n1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:14.080\n the people again. It is really good for science. It celebrates science for several days, different\n\n1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:21.280\n fields, chemistry, medicine and so forth. And everybody doesn't understand everything about\n\n1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:27.760\n these. They're generally fairly abstract, but then it's on the front page of newspapers around\n\n1:29:27.760 --> 1:29:32.080\n the world. So it's really good for science. It's not easy to get science on the front page of the\n\n1:29:32.080 --> 1:29:41.760\n New York Times. It's not there. Should be, but it's not. And so the Nobel prize is important in that\n\n1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:53.520\n way. Otherwise, I have a certain celebrity that I didn't have before. And now you get to be a\n\n1:29:53.520 --> 1:30:01.280\n celebrity that advertises science. It's a mechanism to remind us how incredible, how much credit\n\n1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:06.240\n science deserves and everything. Well, it has a little bit more. One thing I didn't expect,\n\n1:30:06.240 --> 1:30:16.720\n which is good, is that we have a government. I'm not picking on ours necessarily, but it's true of\n\n1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:23.040\n all governments are not run by scientists. In our case, it's run by lawyers and businessmen.\n\n1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:29.520\n Yep. Okay. And at best they may have an aide or something that knows a little science. So\n\n1:30:33.120 --> 1:30:42.640\n in all countries hardly take into account science in making decisions.\n\n1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:44.320\n Yes. Okay. And\n\n1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:53.200\n having a Nobel prize, the people in those positions actually listen. So you have more\n\n1:30:53.200 --> 1:30:58.160\n influence. I don't care whether it's about global warming or what the issue is. There's some\n\n1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:05.120\n influence, which is lacking otherwise. And people pay attention to what I say. If I talk about\n\n1:31:05.120 --> 1:31:12.160\n global warming, they wouldn't have before I had the Nobel prize. Yeah, this is very true. You're\n\n1:31:12.160 --> 1:31:20.000\n like the celebrities who talk. Celebrity has power. Celebrity has power. And that's a good\n\n1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.880\n thing. That's a good thing. Singling out people, I mean, on the other side of it, singling out\n\n1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:32.320\n people has all kinds of, whether it's for Academy Awards or for this, have unfairness and\n\n1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:39.920\n arbitrariness and so forth and so on. So that's the other side of the coin. Just like you said,\n\n1:31:39.920 --> 1:31:45.280\n especially with the huge experimental projects like this, you know, it's a large team and it\n\n1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:49.760\n does the nature of the Nobel prizes. It singles out a few individuals to represent the team.\n\n1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:57.440\n Yeah. Nevertheless, it's a beautiful thing. What are ways to improve LIGO in the future,\n\n1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:03.520\n increase the sensitivity? I've seen a few ideas that are kind of fascinating. Are you interested\n\n1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:09.680\n in them? I'm not speaking about five years. Perhaps you could speak to the next five years,\n\n1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:16.080\n but also the next hundred years. Yeah. So let me talk to both the instrument and the science.\n\n1:32:16.080 --> 1:32:21.200\n Sure. So they go hand in hand. I mean, the thing that I said is if we make it better,\n\n1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:29.760\n we see more kinds of weaker objects and we do astronomy. Okay. We're very motivated to make\n\n1:32:29.760 --> 1:32:36.240\n a new instrument, which will be a big step, the next step, like making a new kind of telescope or\n\n1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:44.400\n something. And the ideas of what that instrument should be haven't converged yet. There's different\n\n1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:52.480\n ideas in Europe. They've done more work to kind of develop the ideas, but they're different from\n\n1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:59.840\n ours and we have ideas. But I think over the next few years, we'll develop those. The idea is to make\n\n1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:06.240\n an instrument that's at least 10 times better than what we can do with this instrument, 10 times\n\n1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:13.600\n better than that. 10 times better means you can look 10 times further out. 10 times further out\n\n1:33:13.600 --> 1:33:21.680\n is a thousand times more volume. So you're seeing much, much more of the universe. The best way to\n\n1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:29.280\n look at it is to look further out. The big change is that if you can see far out, you see further\n\n1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:36.080\n back in history. Yeah, you're traveling back in time. Yeah. And so we can start to do what we\n\n1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:44.160\n call cosmology instead of astronomy or astrophysics. Cosmology is really the study of the evolution of\n\n1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:52.400\n the universe. And so then you can start to hope to get to the important problems having to do with\n\n1:33:53.920 --> 1:34:01.600\n how the universe began, how it evolved and so forth, which we really only study now with\n\n1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:12.320\n optical instruments or electromagnetic waves. And early in the universe, those were blocked because\n\n1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:18.960\n it was, basically it wasn't transparent. So the photons couldn't get out when everything was too\n\n1:34:18.960 --> 1:34:24.240\n dense. What do you think, sorry on this tangent, what do you think an understanding of gravitational\n\n1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.560\n waves from earlier in the universe can help us understand about the Big Bang and all that kind\n\n1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:37.120\n of stuff? Yeah. But it's a non, it's another perspective on the thing. Is there some insights\n\n1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:43.040\n you think could be revealed just to help a layman understand? Sure. First, we don't understand. We\n\n1:34:43.040 --> 1:34:47.920\n use the word Big Bang. We don't understand the physics of what the Big Bang itself was.\n\n1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:58.160\n So I think, and in the early stage, there were particles and there was a huge amount of gravity\n\n1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:10.240\n and mass being made. So I'll say two things. One is, how did it all start? How did it happen? I'll\n\n1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:16.000\n give you at least one example that we don't understand what we should understand. We don't\n\n1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:24.000\n know why we're here. Yes. No, we do not. I don't mean it philosophically. I mean it in terms of\n\n1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:30.720\n physics. Now, what do I mean by that? If I go into my laboratory at CERN or somewhere and I\n\n1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:38.480\n collide particles together or put energy together, I make as much anti matter as matter. Anti matter\n\n1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:49.120\n then annihilates matter and makes energy. So in the early universe, you made somehow a lot of\n\n1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:54.960\n matter and anti matter, but there was an asymmetry. Somehow there was more matter and anti matter.\n\n1:35:55.520 --> 1:35:59.520\n The matter and anti matter annihilated each other. At least that's what we think.\n\n1:35:59.520 --> 1:36:04.960\n And there was only matter leftover. And we live in a universe that we see this all matter.\n\n1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:12.640\n We don't have any idea. We have ideas, but we don't have any way to understand that at the\n\n1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:19.600\n present time with the physics that we know. Can I ask a dumb question? Does anti matter have\n\n1:36:19.600 --> 1:36:29.040\n anything like a gravitational field to send signals? So how does this asymmetry of matter\n\n1:36:29.040 --> 1:36:35.520\n and anti matter could be investigated or further understood by observing gravitational fields or\n\n1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:45.360\n weirdnesses in gravitational fields? I think that in principle, if there were anti neutron stars,\n\n1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:51.280\n instead of just neutron stars, we would see different kinds of signals, but it didn't get\n\n1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:56.960\n to that. We live in a universe that we've done enough looking because we don't see anti matter,\n\n1:36:56.960 --> 1:37:01.280\n anti protons anywhere, no matter what we look at, that it's all made out of matter.\n\n1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:04.800\n Hmm. There is no anti matter except when we go in our laboratories.\n\n1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:11.280\n So, but when we go in our laboratories, we make as much anti matter as matter.\n\n1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:16.320\n So there's something about the early universe that made this asymmetry. So we can't even\n\n1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:25.360\n explain why we're here. That's what I meant. Physics wise, not in terms of how we evolved\n\n1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:36.080\n and all that kind of stuff. So there might be inklings of some of the physics that gravitational\n\n1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:42.720\n So gravitational waves don't get obstructed like light. So I said light only goes to 300,000 years.\n\n1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:47.520\n So it goes back to the beginning. So if you could study the early universe with gravitational waves,\n\n1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:54.240\n we can't do that yet. Then it took 400 years to be able to do that with optical, but\n\n1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:59.360\n but then you can really understand the very, maybe understand the very early universe.\n\n1:38:00.400 --> 1:38:10.400\n So in terms of questions like why we're here or what the big bang was, we should be, we can,\n\n1:38:10.400 --> 1:38:15.360\n in principle, study that with gravitational waves. So to keep moving in this direction,\n\n1:38:15.360 --> 1:38:20.400\n it's a unique kind of way to understand our universe.\n\n1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:24.640\n So you think there's more Nobel prize level ideas to be discovered in relation to\n\n1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:31.680\n I'd be shocked if there, if there isn't, not even going to that, which is a very long range problem.\n\n1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:39.280\n But I think that we only see with electromagnetic waves, 4% of what's out there.\n\n1:38:39.280 --> 1:38:48.240\n There must be, we looked for things that we knew should be there. There should be,\n\n1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:58.960\n I would be shocked if there wasn't physics, objects, science, and with gravity that doesn't\n\n1:38:58.960 --> 1:39:06.480\n show up in everything we do with telescopes. So I think we're just limited by not having\n\n1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:09.280\n powerful enough instruments yet to do this.\n\n1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:16.560\n Do you have a preference? I keep seeing this E. Lisa idea.\n\n1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:17.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:26.960\n Is it, do you have a preference for earthbound or space faring mechanisms for?\n\n1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:32.880\n They're complimentary. It's a little bit like, it's completely analogous to what's been done\n\n1:39:32.880 --> 1:39:39.760\n in astronomy. So astronomy from the time of Galileo was done with visible light.\n\n1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.560\n The big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years are because we have instruments that look\n\n1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:54.160\n at the infrared, microwave, ultraviolet and so forth. So looking at different wavelengths\n\n1:39:54.160 --> 1:40:00.240\n has been important. Basically going into space means that we'll look at instead of the audio\n\n1:40:00.240 --> 1:40:04.880\n band, which we look at, as we said on the Earth's surface, we'll look at lower frequencies.\n\n1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:10.960\n So it's completely complimentary and it starts to be looking at different frequencies just\n\n1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:12.400\n like we do with astronomy.\n\n1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:18.960\n It seems almost incredible to me, engineering wise, just like on earth to send something\n\n1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:25.360\n that's kilometers across into space. Is that harder to engineer?\n\n1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:32.880\n It actually is a little different. It's three satellites separated by hundreds of thousands\n\n1:40:32.880 --> 1:40:42.960\n of kilometers and they send a laser beam from one to the other. And if the triangle changes\n\n1:40:42.960 --> 1:40:45.360\n shape a little bit, they detect that from a graph.\n\n1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:56.160\n Did you say hundreds of thousands of kilometers? Yeah. Sending lasers to each other. Okay.\n\n1:40:56.160 --> 1:40:57.200\n It's just engineering.\n\n1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:02.160\n Is it possible though? Is it doable?\n\n1:41:02.160 --> 1:41:02.400\n Yes.\n\n1:41:03.520 --> 1:41:11.040\n Okay. That's just incredible because they have to maintain, I mean, the precision here\n\n1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:16.800\n is probably, there might be some more, what is it? Maybe noise is a smaller problem. I\n\n1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:22.880\n guess there's no vibration to worry about like seismic stuff. So getting away from earth,\n\n1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:23.680\n maybe you get away from seismic stuff.\n\n1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:28.160\n Yeah. Those parts are easier. They don't have to measure it as accurately at low frequencies.\n\n1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:33.200\n But they have a lot of tough engineering problems.\n\n1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:44.000\n In order to detect that the gravitational waves affect things, the sensors have to be\n\n1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.400\n what we call free masses, just like ours, are isolated from the earth. They have to\n\n1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:54.080\n isolate it from the satellite. And that's a hard problem. They have to do that pretty,\n\n1:41:54.080 --> 1:42:00.080\n not as well as we have to do it, but very well. And they've done a test mission and\n\n1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:06.880\n the engineering seems to be at least in principle in hand. This will be in the 2030s.\n\n1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:07.920\n 2030s?\n\n1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:08.160\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:09.600 --> 1:42:16.080\n This is incredible. This is incredible. Let me ask about black holes.\n\n1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:27.440\n So what we're talking about is observing orbiting black holes. I saw the terminology of like\n\n1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:28.880\n binary black hole systems.\n\n1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:29.680\n Binary black holes.\n\n1:42:29.680 --> 1:42:33.040\n Is that the one that's when they're dancing? Okay.\n\n1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:36.080\n They're both going around each other, just like the earth around the sun.\n\n1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:39.440\n Okay. Is that weird that there's black holes going around each other?\n\n1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:45.200\n So the finding binary systems of stars is similar to finding binary systems of...\n\n1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:46.560\n Of black holes.\n\n1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:55.760\n Well, they were once stars. So we haven't said what a black hole is physically yet.\n\n1:42:55.760 --> 1:42:56.880\n Yeah. What's a black hole?\n\n1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:03.280\n So black hole is first, it's a mathematical concept or a physical concept. And that is\n\n1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:10.640\n a region of space. So it's simply a region of space where the curvature of space time,\n\n1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:17.920\n meaning the gravitational field is so strong that nothing can get out, including light.\n\n1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:26.320\n And there's light gets bent if the space time is warped enough.\n\n1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:31.360\n And so even light gets bent around and stays in it. So that's the concept of a black hole.\n\n1:43:33.200 --> 1:43:39.280\n And maybe you can make... So that's a concept that didn't say how they come about.\n\n1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.600\n And there could be different ways they come about. The ones that we are seeing,\n\n1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:52.480\n we're not sure. That's what we're trying to learn now is what they...\n\n1:43:52.480 --> 1:44:00.880\n But the general expectation is that they come... These black holes happen when a star dies.\n\n1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:06.400\n So what does that mean that a star dies? What happens? A star like our sun\n\n1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:17.600\n basically makes heat and light by fusion. It's made up. And as it burns, it burns up the hydrogen\n\n1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:24.240\n and then the helium and slowly works its way up to the heavier and heavier elements that are\n\n1:44:24.240 --> 1:44:29.840\n in the star. And when it gets up to iron, the fusion process doesn't work anymore.\n\n1:44:30.560 --> 1:44:37.200\n And so the stars die and that happens to stars. And then they do what's called a supernova.\n\n1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:43.760\n What happens then is that a star is a delicate balance between an outward pressure from fusion\n\n1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:50.080\n and light and burning and an inward pressure of gravity trying to pull the\n\n1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:57.760\n masses together. Once it burns itself out, it goes and it collapses and that's a supernova.\n\n1:44:57.760 --> 1:45:05.440\n When it collapses, all the mass that was there is in a very much smaller space. And if a star,\n\n1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:11.680\n if you do the calculations, if a star is big enough, that can create a strong enough\n\n1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:17.920\n gravitational field to make a black hole. Our sun won't. It's too small.\n\n1:45:17.920 --> 1:45:18.480\n Too small.\n\n1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:26.400\n And we don't know exactly what, but it's usually thought that a star has to be at least three\n\n1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:32.160\n times as big as our sun to make a black hole. But that's the physical way there.\n\n1:45:32.160 --> 1:45:34.800\n You can make black holes. That's the first\n\n1:45:34.800 --> 1:45:41.840\n explanation that one would give for what we see,\n\n1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:45.440\n but it's not necessarily true. We're not sure yet.\n\n1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:48.560\n What we see in terms of, for the origins of black holes?\n\n1:45:48.560 --> 1:45:52.320\n No, the black holes that we see in gravitational waves.\n\n1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:56.720\n So the, but you're also looking for the ones who are binary solar systems.\n\n1:45:56.720 --> 1:46:01.760\n So they're binary systems, but they could have been made from binary stars. So there's binary\n\n1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:07.520\n stars around. So that's, so that's the first explanation is that that's what they are.\n\n1:46:07.520 --> 1:46:07.920\n Gotcha.\n\n1:46:09.760 --> 1:46:16.800\n Other explanations, but what we see has some puzzles. This is kind of the way science works,\n\n1:46:16.800 --> 1:46:29.280\n I guess. We see heavier ones than up to, we've seen one system that was 140 times the mass of\n\n1:46:29.280 --> 1:46:39.760\n our own sun. That's not believed to be possible with the parent being a big star because big\n\n1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:49.120\n stars can only be so big or they are unstable. It's just the fact that they live in an environment\n\n1:46:49.120 --> 1:46:55.920\n that makes them unstable. So the fact that we see bigger ones, they may be come from something else.\n\n1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:04.800\n It's possible that they were made in a different way by little ones eating each other up or maybe\n\n1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:11.600\n they were made or maybe they came with the big bang. The prime, what we call primordial, which\n\n1:47:11.600 --> 1:47:16.160\n means they're really different. They came from that. We don't know at this point if they came\n\n1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:21.040\n with a big bang, then maybe they account for what we call dark matter or some of it.\n\n1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:26.080\n Hmm. Like there was a lot of them if they came with it because there's a lot of dark matter.\n\n1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:26.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:27.360 --> 1:47:34.240\n But will gravitational waves give you any kind of intuition about the origin of these oscillating?\n\n1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:39.600\n We think that if we see the distributions enough of them, the distributions of their\n\n1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.760\n masses, the distributions of how they're spinning, so we can actually measure when they're going\n\n1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:55.120\n around each other, whether they're spinning like this or whether the whole system has any wobbles.\n\n1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:59.120\n What? So this is now. Okay.\n\n1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:01.280\n We're doing that.\n\n1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:04.400\n And then you're constantly kind of crawling back and back in time.\n\n1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:09.920\n And we're crawling back in time and seeing how many there are as we go back. And so do they\n\n1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:10.480\n point back.\n\n1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:15.920\n So you're like, what is that discipline called, cartography or something? You're like mapping\n\n1:48:15.920 --> 1:48:21.920\n this, the early universe via the lens of gravitational waves.\n\n1:48:21.920 --> 1:48:24.080\n Not yet the early universe, but at least back in time.\n\n1:48:24.080 --> 1:48:24.720\n Earlier.\n\n1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:32.960\n Yeah. So black holes are this mathematical phenomenon, but they come about in different\n\n1:48:32.960 --> 1:48:39.600\n ways. We have a huge black hole at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies. Those probably\n\n1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:44.160\n were made some other way. We don't know when the galaxies themselves had to do with the\n\n1:48:44.160 --> 1:48:49.680\n formation of galaxies. We don't really know. So the fact that we use the word black hole,\n\n1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:56.480\n the origin of black holes might be quite different depending on how they happen. They just have\n\n1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:00.160\n to in the end have a gravitational field that will bend everything in.\n\n1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:06.720\n How do you feel about black holes as a human being? There's this thing that's nearly\n\n1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:13.680\n infinitely dense, doesn't let light escape. Isn't that kind of terrifying? It feels like\n\n1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:14.960\n the stuff in nightmares.\n\n1:49:14.960 --> 1:49:17.600\n I think it's an opportunity.\n\n1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:20.160\n To do what exactly?\n\n1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:26.800\n So like the early universe is an opportunity. If we can study the early universe, we can\n\n1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:32.720\n learn things like I told you. And here again, we have an embarrassing situation in physics.\n\n1:49:32.720 --> 1:49:39.920\n We have two wonderful theories of physics, one based on quantum mechanics, quantum field\n\n1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:46.000\n theory. And we can go to a big accelerator like at CERN and smash particles together\n\n1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:51.840\n and almost explain anything that happens beautifully using quantum field theory and\n\n1:49:51.840 --> 1:49:57.200\n quantum mechanics. Then we have another theory of physics called general relativity, which\n\n1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:02.160\n is what we've been talking about most of the time, which is fantastic at describing the\n\n1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:12.000\n things at high velocities, long distances, and so forth. So that's not the way it's\n\n1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:17.920\n supposed to be. We're trying to create a theory of physics, not two theories of physics.\n\n1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:22.960\n So we have an embarrassment that we have two different theories of physics. People have\n\n1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:28.080\n tried to make a unified theory, what they call a unified theory. You've heard those\n\n1:50:28.080 --> 1:50:36.560\n words for decades. They still haven't. That's been primarily done theoretically or tried.\n\n1:50:36.560 --> 1:50:44.640\n People actively do that. My personal belief is that like much of physics, we need some\n\n1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:51.280\n clues. So we need some experimental evidence. So where is there a place? If we go to CERN\n\n1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:56.160\n and do those experiments, gravitational waves or general relativity don't matter. If we\n\n1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:02.560\n go to study our black holes, elementary particle physics doesn't matter. We're studying these\n\n1:51:02.560 --> 1:51:09.120\n huge objects. So where might we have a place where both phenomena have to be satisfied?\n\n1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:15.920\n An example is black holes. Inside black holes. Yeah. So we can't do that today. But when\n\n1:51:15.920 --> 1:51:24.160\n I think of black hole, it's a potential treasure chest of understanding the fundamental problems\n\n1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:32.800\n of physics and maybe can give us clues to how we bring to the embarrassment of having\n\n1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:38.960\n two theories of physics together. That's my own romantic idea. What's the worst that could\n\n1:51:38.960 --> 1:51:45.040\n happen? It's so enticing. Just go in and look. Do you think, how far are we away from\n\n1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:50.880\n figuring out the unified theory of physics, the theory of everything? What's your sense?\n\n1:51:50.880 --> 1:52:02.080\n Who will solve it? Like what discipline will solve it? Yeah. I think so little progress\n\n1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:16.080\n has been made without more experimental clues, as I said, that we're just not able to say\n\n1:52:16.080 --> 1:52:26.320\n that we're close without some clues. The most popular theory these days that might lead\n\n1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:34.440\n to that is called string theory. The problem with string theory is it solves a lot of beautiful\n\n1:52:34.440 --> 1:52:46.720\n mathematical problems we have in physics. It's very satisfying theoretically, but it\n\n1:52:46.720 --> 1:52:53.840\n has almost no predictive, maybe no predictive ability because it is a theory that works\n\n1:52:53.840 --> 1:53:02.080\n in 11 dimensions. We live in a physical world of three space and one time dimension. In\n\n1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:08.720\n order to make predictions in our world with string theory, you have to somehow get rid\n\n1:53:08.720 --> 1:53:15.280\n of these other seven dimensions. That's done mathematically by saying they curl up on each\n\n1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:23.400\n other on scales that are too small to affect anything here. That's an okay argument, but\n\n1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:30.320\n how you do that is not unique. That means if I start with that theory and I go to our\n\n1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:37.280\n world here, I can't uniquely go to it. And if I can't, it's not predictive. And that's\n\n1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:42.480\n actually a killer. That's a killer. And string theory is, it seems like from my outsider's\n\n1:53:42.480 --> 1:53:46.920\n perspective has lost favor over the years, perhaps because of this very idea. It's a\n\n1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:52.440\n lack of predictive power. I mean, that science has to connect to something where you make\n\n1:53:52.440 --> 1:53:59.960\n predictions as beautiful as it might be. So I don't think we're close. I think we need\n\n1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:07.520\n some experimental clues. It may be that information on something we don't understand presently\n\n1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:12.680\n at all, like dark energy or probably not dark matter, but dark energy or something might\n\n1:54:12.680 --> 1:54:26.160\n give us some ideas. But I can't envision right now in the short term, meaning the horizon\n\n1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:31.760\n that we can see how we're going to bring these two theories together.\n\n1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:38.560\n A kind of a two part question, maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways.\n\n1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:47.760\n One question is, do you have hope that humans will colonize the galaxy? So expand out, become\n\n1:54:47.760 --> 1:54:53.080\n a multi planetary species. Another way of asking that from a gravitational and a propulsion\n\n1:54:53.080 --> 1:54:57.160\n perspective, do you think we'll come up with ways to travel closer to the speed of light\n\n1:54:57.160 --> 1:55:02.280\n or maybe faster than the speed of light, which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier\n\n1:55:02.280 --> 1:55:06.120\n to expand out into the universe?\n\n1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:17.800\n Yeah. Well, I think that's very futuristic. I think we're not that far from being able\n\n1:55:17.800 --> 1:55:29.720\n to make a one way trip to Mars. That's then a question of whether people are willing to\n\n1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:31.640\n send somebody on a one way trip.\n\n1:55:31.640 --> 1:55:36.840\n Oh, I think they are. There's a lot of the explorers burned bright within our hearts.\n\n1:55:36.840 --> 1:55:37.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:42.920\n There's a lot of people willing to die for the opportunity to explore new territory.\n\n1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:51.280\n So this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive. They have a little helicopter. They're going\n\n1:55:51.280 --> 1:55:57.920\n to fly around. You can imagine in the not too distant future that you could have, I\n\n1:55:57.920 --> 1:56:04.520\n don't think civilizations colonizing, I can envision, but I can envision something more\n\n1:56:04.520 --> 1:56:12.000\n like the South Pole. We haven't colonized Antarctica because it's all ice and cold and\n\n1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:19.000\n so forth. But we have stations. So we have a station that's self sustaining at the South\n\n1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000\n Pole. I've been there. It has.\n\n1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:23.000\n Wow, really?\n\n1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:24.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:30.080\n What's that like? Because there's parallels there to go to Mars.\n\n1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:31.080\n It's fantastic.\n\n1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:33.480\n What's the journey like?\n\n1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:41.640\n The journey involves going. The South Pole station is run in the US by the National Science\n\n1:56:41.640 --> 1:56:48.160\n Foundation. I went because I was on the National Science Board that runs the National Science\n\n1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:56.120\n Foundation. And so you get a VIP trip if you're healthy enough to the South Pole to see it,\n\n1:56:56.120 --> 1:57:08.840\n which I took. You fly from the US to Australia to Christchurch in Southern Australia. And\n\n1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:13.840\n from there you fly to McMurdo Station, which is on the coast. And it's the station with\n\n1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:20.600\n about a thousand people right on the coast of Antarctica. It's about a seven or eight\n\n1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:28.040\n hour flight and they can't predict the weather. So when I flew from Christchurch to McMurdo\n\n1:57:28.040 --> 1:57:32.980\n Station, they tell you in advance, you do it in a military aircraft, they tell you in\n\n1:57:32.980 --> 1:57:37.840\n advance that they can't predict whether they can land because they have to land on ice.\n\n1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:38.840\n And reassuring.\n\n1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:46.760\n Yeah. And so about halfway the pilot got on and said, sorry, this is a, they call it a\n\n1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.360\n boomerang flight. You know, boomerang goes out and goes back. So we had to stay a little\n\n1:57:52.360 --> 1:57:59.560\n while in Christchurch, but then we eventually went to McMurdo Station and then flew to the\n\n1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:07.920\n South Pole. The South Pole itself is, when I was there, it was minus 51 degrees. That\n\n1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:26.840\n was summer. Zero humidity. And it's about 11,000 feet altitude because it's never warm\n\n1:58:26.840 --> 1:58:32.040\n enough for anything to melt. So it doesn't snow very much, but it's about 11,000 feet\n\n1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:41.480\n of snowpack. So you land in a place that's high altitude, cold as could be, and incredibly\n\n1:58:41.480 --> 1:58:52.360\n dry, which means you have a physical adjustment. The place itself is fantastic. They have this\n\n1:58:52.360 --> 1:59:00.320\n great station there. They do astronomy at the South Pole. Nature wise, is it beautiful?\n\n1:59:00.320 --> 1:59:05.160\n What's the experience like? Or is it like visiting any town? No, it's very small. There's\n\n1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:13.120\n only less than a hundred people there. Even when I was there, there were about 50 or 60\n\n1:59:13.120 --> 1:59:18.800\n there. And in the winter, there's less, half of that. Their winter. Yeah. It gets real\n\n1:59:18.800 --> 1:59:28.640\n cold. It gets really cold, yeah. But it's a station. And I think, and that's, I mean,\n\n1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:33.920\n we haven't gone beyond that. On the coast of Antarctica, they have greenhouses and they're\n\n1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:40.840\n self sustaining in McMurdo Station, but we haven't really settled more than that kind\n\n1:59:40.840 --> 1:59:55.440\n of thing in Antarctica, which is a big country or a big plot, a big piece of land. So I don't,\n\n1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:04.640\n I can't envision kind of colonizing at people living so much, as much as I can see the equivalent\n\n2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:10.400\n of the South Pole Station. Well, in the computing world, there's an idea of backing up your\n\n2:00:10.400 --> 2:00:16.520\n data and then you want to do offsite backup, to make sure that if the whole thing burns,\n\n2:00:16.520 --> 2:00:21.520\n if your whole house burns down, that you can have a backup offsite of the data. I think\n\n2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:28.260\n the difference between Antarctica and Mars is Mars is an offsite backup. That if we have\n\n2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:32.800\n nuclear war, whatever the heck might happen here on earth, it'd be nice to have a backup\n\n2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:38.000\n elsewhere. And it'd be nice to have a large enough colony where we sent a variety of people\n\n2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:48.160\n except a few silly astronauts in suits, have an actual vibrant, get a few musicians and\n\n2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:53.920\n artists up there, get a few, maybe like one or two computer scientists, those are essential.\n\n2:00:53.920 --> 2:00:56.320\n Maybe even a physicist, but I'm not sure.\n\n2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:02.200\n Yeah, maybe not. So that comes back to something you talked about earlier, which is the paradox,\n\n2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:10.360\n Fermi's paradox, because you talked about having to escape. And so one number you don't\n\n2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:15.760\n know how to use in Fermi's calculation or Drake, who's done it better, is how long do\n\n2:01:15.760 --> 2:01:24.320\n civilizations last? We've barely gotten to where we can communicate with electricity\n\n2:01:24.320 --> 2:01:28.040\n and magnetism and maybe we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon.\n\n2:01:28.040 --> 2:01:32.480\n Are you hopeful in general? Like you think we've got another couple of hundred years\n\n2:01:32.480 --> 2:01:35.680\n at least? Or are you worried?\n\n2:01:35.680 --> 2:01:47.480\n Well, no, I'm hopeful, but I don't know if I'm hopeful in the longterm. If you say, are\n\n2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:55.720\n we able to go for another couple of thousand years? I'm not sure. I think we have where\n\n2:01:55.720 --> 2:02:00.760\n we started, the fact that we can do things that don't allow us to kind of keep going\n\n2:02:00.760 --> 2:02:06.560\n or there can be, whether it ends up being a virus that we create or ends up being the\n\n2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:11.480\n equivalent of nuclear war or something else. It's not clear that we can control things\n\n2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:13.120\n well enough.\n\n2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:20.520\n So speaking of really cold conditions and not being hopeful and eventual suffering and\n\n2:02:20.520 --> 2:02:26.120\n destruction of the human species, let me ask you about Russian literature. You mentioned,\n\n2:02:26.120 --> 2:02:30.960\n how's that for transition? I'm doing my best here. You mentioned that you used to love\n\n2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:36.760\n literature when you were younger and you even were hoping to be a writer yourself. That\n\n2:02:36.760 --> 2:02:43.760\n was the motivation. And some of the books I've seen that you listed that were inspiring\n\n2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:52.960\n to you was from Russian literature, like Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn. Maybe in general\n\n2:02:52.960 --> 2:02:57.840\n you can speak to your fascination with Russian literature or in general what you picked up\n\n2:02:57.840 --> 2:02:58.840\n from those.\n\n2:02:58.840 --> 2:03:08.320\n I'm not surprised you picked up on the Russian literature, your background, but that's okay.\n\n2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:12.040\n You should be surprised I didn't make the entire conversation about this. That's the\n\n2:03:12.040 --> 2:03:13.040\n real surprise.\n\n2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:24.280\n Yeah. When I didn't really become a physicist or want to go in science until I started college.\n\n2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:29.680\n So when I was younger, I was good at math and that kind of stuff, but I didn't really,\n\n2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:36.400\n I came from a family, nobody went to college and I didn't have any mentors. But I liked\n\n2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:42.440\n to read when I was really young. And so when I was very young, I always carried around\n\n2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:49.280\n a pocket book and read it. And my mother read these mystery stories and I got bored by those\n\n2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:55.500\n eventually. And then I discovered real literature. I don't know what age, but about 12 or 13.\n\n2:03:55.500 --> 2:04:00.640\n And so then I started reading good literature and there's nothing better than Russian literature,\n\n2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:01.640\n of course.\n\n2:04:01.640 --> 2:04:02.640\n Thank you.\n\n2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:16.240\n Reading good literature. So I read quite a bit of Russian literature at that time. And\n\n2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:22.840\n so you asked me about, well, I don't know, I'll say a few words, Dostoevsky. So what\n\n2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:33.200\n about Dostoevsky? For me, Dostoevsky was important in two, I mean, I've read a lot of literature\n\n2:04:33.200 --> 2:04:39.160\n because it's kind of the other thing I do with my life. And he made two incredible,\n\n2:04:39.160 --> 2:04:46.960\n in addition to his own literature, he influenced literature tremendously by having, I don't\n\n2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:53.720\n know how to pronounce polyphony. So he's the first real serious author that had multiple\n\n2:04:53.720 --> 2:05:05.440\n narrators. And he absolutely is the first. And he also was the first, he began existential\n\n2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:12.440\n literature. So the most important book that I've read in the last year when I've been\n\n2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:20.960\n forced to be isolated was existential literature. I decided to reread Camus, The Plague.\n\n2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:23.880\n Oh, yeah. That's a great book.\n\n2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:26.400\n It's a great book and it's right now to read it. It's fantastic.\n\n2:05:26.400 --> 2:05:30.960\n I think that book is about love, actually. Love for humanity.\n\n2:05:30.960 --> 2:05:37.080\n It is, but it has all the, if you haven't read it in recent years, I had read it before,\n\n2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:43.080\n of course, but to read it during this, because it's about a plague. So it's really fantastic\n\n2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:48.000\n to read down. But that reminds me of, he was a great existentialist, but the beginning\n\n2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.800\n of existential literature was Dostoevsky.\n\n2:05:50.800 --> 2:05:51.940\n Dostoevsky, yeah.\n\n2:05:51.940 --> 2:06:00.280\n So in addition to his own great novels, he had a tremendous impact on literature.\n\n2:06:00.280 --> 2:06:06.300\n And there's also for Dostoevsky, unlike most other existentialists, he was at least in\n\n2:06:06.300 --> 2:06:12.360\n part religious. I mean, religiosity permeated his idea. I mean, one of my favorite books\n\n2:06:12.360 --> 2:06:16.720\n of his is The Idiot, which is a Christlike figure in there.\n\n2:06:16.720 --> 2:06:19.280\n Well, there's Prince Mishkin, is that his name?\n\n2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:20.280\n Prince Mishkin, yeah.\n\n2:06:20.280 --> 2:06:21.280\n Yeah, Mishkin.\n\n2:06:21.280 --> 2:06:22.280\n Yeah, Mishkin.\n\n2:06:22.280 --> 2:06:23.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:23.280 --> 2:06:25.960\n That's one thing about, you read it in English, I presume.\n\n2:06:25.960 --> 2:06:26.960\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:30.500\n Yeah. So the names, that's what gets a lot of people. There's so many names, so hard\n\n2:06:30.500 --> 2:06:35.700\n to pronounce. You have to remember all of them. It's like you have the same problem.\n\n2:06:35.700 --> 2:06:38.320\n But he was a great character.\n\n2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:47.240\n I kind of have a connection with him, because I often, the title of the book, The Idiot,\n\n2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:52.620\n is I kind of, I often call myself an idiot, because that's how I feel. I feel so naive\n\n2:06:52.620 --> 2:06:59.600\n about this world. And I'm not sure, I'm not sure why that is. Maybe it's genetic or so\n\n2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:05.160\n on. But I have a connection, a spiritual connection to that character.\n\n2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:06.160\n To Mishkin.\n\n2:07:06.160 --> 2:07:07.160\n To Mishkin, yeah.\n\n2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:10.160\n But he was far from an idiot.\n\n2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:17.400\n No, in some sense, in some sense. But in another sense, maybe not of this world.\n\n2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:23.020\n In another sense he was. I mean, he was a bumbler, a bunker.\n\n2:07:23.020 --> 2:07:28.160\n But you also mentioned Solzhenitsyn, very interesting.\n\n2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:36.800\n And he always confused me. Of course, he was really, really important in writing about\n\n2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:48.480\n Stalin, and first getting in trouble, and then later he wrote about Stalin in a way,\n\n2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:55.640\n I forget what the book was, in a way that was very critical of Lenin.\n\n2:07:55.640 --> 2:08:00.640\n Yeah, he's evolved through the years, and he actually showed support for Putin eventually.\n\n2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:08.480\n It was a very interesting transition he took, no, journey he took through thinking about\n\n2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:17.920\n Russia and the Soviet Union. But I think what I get from him is basic, it's like Viktor\n\n2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:25.640\n has this man's search for meaning. I have a similar kind of sense of the cruelty of\n\n2:08:25.640 --> 2:08:31.520\n human nature, cruelty of indifference, but also the ability to find happiness in the\n\n2:08:31.520 --> 2:08:37.720\n small joys of life. That's something, there's nothing like a prison camp that makes you\n\n2:08:37.720 --> 2:08:41.760\n realize you could still be happy with a very, very little.\n\n2:08:41.760 --> 2:08:50.160\n Yeah, his description of how to go through a day and actually enjoy it in a prison camp\n\n2:08:50.160 --> 2:08:56.760\n is pretty amazing. And some prison camp, it's the worst of the worst.\n\n2:08:56.760 --> 2:09:09.440\n And also, I do think about the role of authoritarian states in hopeful idealistic systems somehow\n\n2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:16.760\n leading to the suffering of millions. And this might be arguable, but I think a lot\n\n2:09:16.760 --> 2:09:24.240\n of people believe that Stalin, I think, genuinely believed that he's doing good for the world.\n\n2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:32.280\n And he wasn't. It's a very valuable lesson that even evil people think they're doing\n\n2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:38.360\n good. Otherwise, it's too difficult to do the evil. The best way to do evil is to believe\n\n2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:44.000\n about framing it in a way like you're doing good. And then this is a very clear picture\n\n2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:53.400\n of that, which is the gulags. And Solzhenitsyn is one of the best people to reveal that.\n\n2:09:53.400 --> 2:09:58.880\n The most recent thing I read, it isn't actually fiction, was the woman, I can't remember\n\n2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:04.280\n her name, who got the Nobel Prize about within the last five years. I don't know whether\n\n2:10:04.280 --> 2:10:09.840\n she's Ukrainian or Russian, but there are interviews. Have you read that?\n\n2:10:09.840 --> 2:10:12.680\n Interview of Ukrainian survivors of...\n\n2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:18.560\n Well, I think she may be originally Ukrainian. The book's written in Russian and translated\n\n2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:23.920\n in English, and many of the interviews are in Moscow and places. But she won the Nobel\n\n2:10:23.920 --> 2:10:31.080\n Prize within the last five years or so. But what's interesting is that these are people\n\n2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:39.040\n of all different ages, all different occupations and so forth, and they're reflecting on their\n\n2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:45.560\n reaction to basically the present Soviet system, the system they lived with before.\n\n2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:57.400\n There's a lot of looking back by a lot of them with, well, it being much better before.\n\n2:10:57.400 --> 2:11:05.680\n Yeah. I don't know what... In America, we think we know the right answer, what it means\n\n2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:11.440\n to be, to build a better world. I'm not so sure. I think we're all just trying to figure\n\n2:11:11.440 --> 2:11:12.440\n it out.\n\n2:11:12.440 --> 2:11:13.440\n Yeah, there's...\n\n2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:14.440\n We're doing our best.\n\n2:11:14.440 --> 2:11:17.600\n I think you're right.\n\n2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:23.760\n Is there advice you can give to young people today, besides reading Russian literature\n\n2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:29.920\n at a young age, about how to find their way in life, how to find success in Korea or just\n\n2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:37.080\n life in general?\n\n2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:43.080\n My own belief, it may not be very deep, but I believe it. I think you should follow your\n\n2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:48.600\n dreams and you should have dreams and follow your dreams if you can, to the extent that\n\n2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:55.800\n you can. And we spend a lot of our time doing something with ourselves. In my case, physics,\n\n2:11:55.800 --> 2:12:04.720\n in your case, I don't know, whatever it is, machine learning and this. Yeah, you should\n\n2:12:04.720 --> 2:12:05.720\n have fun.\n\n2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:12.120\n What was... Wait, wait, wait. Follow your dreams. What dream did you have? Because there's...\n\n2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:14.720\n Well, originally, I was...\n\n2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:16.720\n Because you didn't follow your dream. I thought you were supposed to be a writer.\n\n2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:20.400\n I changed along the way. I was gonna be, but I changed.\n\n2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:21.400\n What happened?\n\n2:12:21.400 --> 2:12:28.460\n That was... What happened? Oh, I read... I decided to take the most serious literature\n\n2:12:28.460 --> 2:12:34.800\n course in my high school, which was a mistake. I'd probably be a second rate writer now.\n\n2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:35.800\n And...\n\n2:12:35.800 --> 2:12:37.520\n Could be a Nobel Prize winning writer.\n\n2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:50.080\n And the book that we read, even though I had read Russian novels, I was 15, I think, cured\n\n2:12:50.080 --> 2:12:53.080\n me from being a novelist.\n\n2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:54.080\n Destroyed your dream?\n\n2:12:54.080 --> 2:12:55.080\n Yes.\n\n2:12:55.080 --> 2:12:56.800\n Cured you. Okay. What was the book?\n\n2:12:56.800 --> 2:12:57.800\n Moby Dick.\n\n2:12:57.800 --> 2:12:58.800\n Okay.\n\n2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:00.360\n So, why Moby Dick?\n\n2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:01.360\n Yeah, why?\n\n2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:07.680\n So, I've read it since, and it's a great novel. Maybe it's as good as the Russian novels.\n\n2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:11.280\n I've never made it through. It was too boring. It was too long.\n\n2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:14.400\n Okay. Your words are gonna mesh with what I say.\n\n2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:15.400\n Excellent.\n\n2:13:15.400 --> 2:13:17.880\n And you may have the same problem at older ages.\n\n2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:19.520\n That's why I'm not a writer.\n\n2:13:19.520 --> 2:13:27.120\n It may be. So, the problem is, Moby Dick is... What I remember was there was a chapter that\n\n2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:34.080\n was maybe 100 pages long, all describing this, why there was Ahab and the white whale, and\n\n2:13:34.080 --> 2:13:39.520\n it was the battle between Ahab with his wooden peg leg and the white whale.\n\n2:13:39.520 --> 2:13:43.460\n And there was a chapter that was 100 pages long in my memory, I don't know how long it\n\n2:13:43.460 --> 2:13:49.960\n really was, that described in detail, though, great white whale and what he was doing and\n\n2:13:49.960 --> 2:13:52.360\n what his fins were like and this and that.\n\n2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:58.280\n And it was so incredibly boring, the word you used, that I thought, if this is great\n\n2:13:58.280 --> 2:14:00.280\n literature, screw it.\n\n2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:01.280\n Fascinating.\n\n2:14:01.280 --> 2:14:06.800\n Okay. And now, why did I have a problem? I know now in reflection, because I still read\n\n2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:18.600\n a lot, and I read that novel after I was 30 or 40 years old, and the problem was simple.\n\n2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:25.600\n I diagnosed what the problem was. That novel, in contrast to the Russian novels, which are\n\n2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:32.960\n very realistic and point of view, is one huge metaphor.\n\n2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:37.200\n At 15 years old, I probably didn't know the word, and I certainly didn't know the meaning\n\n2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:38.200\n of metaphor.\n\n2:14:38.200 --> 2:14:42.160\n Yeah, like, why do I care about a fish? Why are you telling me all about this fish?\n\n2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:47.600\n Exactly. It's one big metaphor. So, reading it later as a metaphor, I could really enjoy\n\n2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:51.480\n it. But the teacher gave me the wrong book, or maybe it was the right book because I went\n\n2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:59.320\n into physics. But it was truly, I think, I may oversimplify, but it was really that I\n\n2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:04.360\n was too young to read that book. Not too young to read the Russian novels, interestingly,\n\n2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:08.840\n but too young to read that because I probably didn't even know the word, and I certainly\n\n2:15:08.840 --> 2:15:10.800\n didn't understand it as a metaphor.\n\n2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:15.400\n Well, in terms of fish, I recommend people read Old Man and the Sea, much shorter, much\n\n2:15:15.400 --> 2:15:21.920\n better. It's still a metaphor, though. But you can read it just as a story about a guy\n\n2:15:21.920 --> 2:15:29.560\n catching a fish, and it's still fun to read. I had the same experience as you, not with\n\n2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:34.640\n Moby Dick, but later in college, I took a course on James Joyce. Don't ask me why. I\n\n2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.980\n was majoring in computer science, I took a course on James Joyce. And I was kept being\n\n2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:46.640\n told that he is widely considered, by many considered, to be the greatest literary writer\n\n2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:52.520\n of the 20th century. And I kept reading, I think, so his short story is The Dead, I think\n\n2:15:52.520 --> 2:15:57.360\n it's called. It was very good. Well, not very good, but pretty good. And then Ulysses.\n\n2:15:57.360 --> 2:15:58.360\n It's actually very good.\n\n2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:02.640\n It is very good. Only The Dead, the final story, it still rings with me today. But then\n\n2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:09.400\n Ulysses was, I got through Ulysses with the help of some Cliff Notes and so on. And so\n\n2:16:09.400 --> 2:16:14.760\n I did Ulysses and then Finnegan's Wake. The moment I started Finnegan's Wake, I said,\n\n2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:22.440\n this is stupid. That's when I went full into like, I don't know, that's when I went full\n\n2:16:22.440 --> 2:16:28.480\n Kafka, Bukowski, like people who just talk about the darkness of the human condition\n\n2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:36.520\n in the fewest words possible and without any of the music of language. So it was a turning\n\n2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:45.200\n point as well. I wonder when is the right time to appreciate the beauty of language.\n\n2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:49.040\n Like even Shakespeare. I was very much off put by Shakespeare in high school and only\n\n2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:55.440\n later I started to appreciate its value in the same way. Let me ask you a ridiculous\n\n2:16:55.440 --> 2:17:04.640\n question. Okay. I mean, because you've read Russian literature, let me ask this one last\n\n2:17:04.640 --> 2:17:10.560\n question. I might be lying. There might be a couple more, but what do you think is the\n\n2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:17.980\n meaning of this whole thing? You got a Nobel prize for looking out into the, trying to\n\n2:17:17.980 --> 2:17:24.800\n reach back into the beginning of the universe, listening to the gravitational waves, but\n\n2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:33.840\n that still doesn't answer the why. Why are we here? Beyond just the matter and anti matter,\n\n2:17:33.840 --> 2:17:35.360\n the philosophical question.\n\n2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:42.960\n The philosophical question about the meaning of life, I'm probably not really good at.\n\n2:17:42.960 --> 2:17:56.600\n I think that the individual meaning, I would say it rather simplistically is whether you've\n\n2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:05.160\n made a difference, a positive difference, I'd say for anything besides yourself. Meaning\n\n2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:11.340\n you could have been important to other people or you could have discovered gravitational\n\n2:18:11.340 --> 2:18:16.300\n waves that matters to other people or something, but something beyond just existing on the\n\n2:18:16.300 --> 2:18:27.440\n earth as an individual. So your life has meaning if you have affected either knowledge or people\n\n2:18:27.440 --> 2:18:35.960\n or something beyond yourself. It's a simplistic statement, but it's about as good as I can\n\n2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:46.480\n say. In all of its simplicity, it may be very true. Does it make you sad that this ride\n\n2:18:46.480 --> 2:18:55.360\n ends? Do you think about your mortality? Are you afraid of it?\n\n2:18:55.360 --> 2:19:06.520\n Not exactly afraid of it, but saddened by it. I'm old enough to know that I've lived\n\n2:19:06.520 --> 2:19:14.960\n most of my life and I enjoy being alive. I can imagine being sick and not wanting to\n\n2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:17.560\n be alive, but I'm not.\n\n2:19:17.560 --> 2:19:23.040\n It's been a good ride.\n\n2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:35.720\n I'm not happy to see it come to an end. I'd like to see it prolong, but I don't fear the\n\n2:19:35.720 --> 2:19:44.320\n dying itself or that kind of thing. It's more, I'd like to prolong what is I think a good\n\n2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:51.240\n life that I'm living and still living.\n\n2:19:51.240 --> 2:20:01.600\n It's sad to think that the finiteness of it is the thing that makes it special. And also\n\n2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:08.520\n sad to me, at least it's kind of, I don't think I'm using too strong of a word, but\n\n2:20:08.520 --> 2:20:15.960\n it's kind of terrifying the uncertainty of it. The mystery of it, the mystery of death.\n\n2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:20.120\n The mystery of it, yeah, of death. When we're talking about the mystery of black holes that's\n\n2:20:20.120 --> 2:20:25.120\n somehow distant, that's somehow out there and the mystery of our own.\n\n2:20:25.120 --> 2:20:31.400\n But even life, the mystery of consciousness, I find so hard to deal with too. I mean, it's\n\n2:20:31.400 --> 2:20:37.640\n not as painful. I mean, we're conscious, but the whole magic of life we can understand,\n\n2:20:37.640 --> 2:20:43.560\n but consciousness where we can actually think and so forth. It's pretty.\n\n2:20:43.560 --> 2:20:48.520\n It seems like such a beautiful gift that it really sucks that we get to let go of it.\n\n2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:54.080\n We have to let go of it. What do you hope your legacy is? As I'm sure they will. Aliens\n\n2:20:54.080 --> 2:20:59.320\n when they visit and humans have destroyed all of human civilization. Aliens read about\n\n2:20:59.320 --> 2:21:03.520\n you in an encyclopedia that we'll leave behind. What do you hope it says?\n\n2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:12.280\n Well, I would hope they, to the extent that they evaluated me, felt that I helped move\n\n2:21:12.280 --> 2:21:22.520\n science forward as a tangible contribution and that I served as a good role model for\n\n2:21:22.520 --> 2:21:25.680\n how humans should live their lives.\n\n2:21:25.680 --> 2:21:31.840\n And we're part of creating one of the most incredible things humans have ever created.\n\n2:21:31.840 --> 2:21:36.920\n So yes, there's the science. That's the Fermi thing, right?\n\n2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:38.240\n And the instrument, I guess.\n\n2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:43.960\n And the instrument. The instrument is a magical creation, not just by a human, by a collection\n\n2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:58.720\n of humans. The collaboration is, that's humanity at its best. I do hope we last quite a bit\n\n2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:05.560\n longer, but if we don't, this is a good thing to remember humans by. At least they built\n\n2:22:05.560 --> 2:22:10.320\n that thing. That's pretty impressive. Barry, this is an amazing conversation. Thank you\n\n2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:14.840\n so much for wasting your time and explaining so many things so well. I appreciate your\n\n2:22:14.840 --> 2:22:15.840\n time today.\n\n2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:17.960\n Thank you.\n\n2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:22.760\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Barry Barish. To support this podcast,\n\n2:22:22.760 --> 2:22:28.280\n please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from\n\n2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:35.840\n Werner Heisenberg, a theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics.\n\n2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:43.500\n Not only is the universe stranger than we think, it is stranger than we can think. Thank\n\n2:22:43.500 --> 2:22:58.640\n you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
