  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.180\n The following is a conversation with Travis Stevens,\n\n00:03.180 --> 00:06.340\n 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo\n\n00:06.340 --> 00:09.620\n and one of the greatest American Judo ever.\n\n00:09.620 --> 00:11.260\n But his story is inspiring,\n\n00:11.260 --> 00:13.280\n not because of that Olympic medal,\n\n00:13.280 --> 00:16.180\n but because of the decades of injury, hardship,\n\n00:16.180 --> 00:18.740\n incredible battles against the best in the world,\n\n00:18.740 --> 00:20.900\n wrapping up in close heartbreaking losses\n\n00:20.900 --> 00:23.580\n at the 2008 and 2012 games,\n\n00:23.580 --> 00:27.300\n all of which eventually led to that very silver medal\n\n00:27.300 --> 00:29.300\n in 2016.\n\n00:29.300 --> 00:31.180\n As we talk about in the podcast,\n\n00:31.180 --> 00:34.260\n Travis is also someone who's largely responsible\n\n00:34.260 --> 00:35.900\n for me getting into Judo,\n\n00:35.900 --> 00:38.420\n for which I will forever be grateful.\n\n00:38.420 --> 00:42.620\n He also happens to be now my Judo coach and mentor.\n\n00:42.620 --> 00:44.340\n I'll release a video of Travis and I\n\n00:44.340 --> 00:46.740\n doing some Judo in a few days.\n\n00:46.740 --> 00:48.060\n To support this podcast,\n\n00:48.060 --> 00:50.460\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:51.460 --> 00:53.780\n As a side note, let me say a few words\n\n00:53.780 --> 00:57.140\n that I've written down about the Olympic games\n\n00:57.140 --> 00:59.500\n and the International Olympics Committee.\n\n00:59.500 --> 01:02.340\n I'm visiting family as the T shirt,\n\n01:03.220 --> 01:06.620\n but I had to pull away to write and to say these words\n\n01:06.620 --> 01:10.660\n because this very video was taken down by YouTube\n\n01:10.660 --> 01:13.860\n as per the request of the IOC.\n\n01:13.860 --> 01:16.340\n You know it's serious when a Russian takes time away\n\n01:16.340 --> 01:18.340\n from family, food and drink.\n\n01:19.420 --> 01:21.940\n I'm heartbroken to see continued incompetence,\n\n01:21.940 --> 01:24.740\n greed and corruption on the part of the IOC\n\n01:24.740 --> 01:27.780\n in failing to do as the Olympic charter states,\n\n01:27.780 --> 01:31.100\n to quote, ensure the fullest coverage\n\n01:31.100 --> 01:33.660\n and the widest possible audience in the world\n\n01:33.660 --> 01:36.020\n for the Olympic games, end quote.\n\n01:37.220 --> 01:38.820\n I want to give you two facts.\n\n01:38.820 --> 01:41.980\n First, they do not make most of the videos of the games\n\n01:41.980 --> 01:45.520\n available for replay anywhere that is accessible,\n\n01:45.520 --> 01:47.340\n searchable and discoverable,\n\n01:47.340 --> 01:50.020\n whether funded by ads or by subscriptions.\n\n01:50.020 --> 01:53.300\n For example, on YouTube or their own service,\n\n01:53.300 --> 01:56.380\n it is not available anywhere.\n\n01:56.380 --> 02:00.220\n Second, in the most absurd violation of the Olympic charter,\n\n02:00.220 --> 02:05.060\n they've uploaded all of the videos of the 2012, 2016\n\n02:05.060 --> 02:09.860\n and the 2020 slash 21 Olympics to YouTube.\n\n02:09.860 --> 02:13.100\n And they set all of these videos to private.\n\n02:14.220 --> 02:17.260\n This results in a situation like my four hour conversation\n\n02:17.260 --> 02:19.300\n that you're watching now with Travis Stevens\n\n02:19.300 --> 02:22.780\n being taken down due to us including a few seconds\n\n02:22.780 --> 02:26.280\n of a small video overlay of Travis's epic match\n\n02:26.280 --> 02:28.540\n against Ole Bischoff in 2012.\n\n02:28.540 --> 02:32.180\n This is done automatically as per the request of the IOC.\n\n02:32.180 --> 02:36.540\n I have the video due to having screen recorded it from 2012.\n\n02:36.540 --> 02:40.620\n Here you have Travis Stevens, an Olympic silver medalist,\n\n02:40.620 --> 02:43.820\n someone who spent his entire life overcoming injuries,\n\n02:43.820 --> 02:47.540\n losses, hard weight cuts, periods of no financial\n\n02:47.540 --> 02:49.740\n or psychological support culminating\n\n02:49.740 --> 02:54.580\n in the biggest heartbreak of his career in this one match.\n\n02:54.580 --> 02:57.460\n And this match is available nowhere online,\n\n02:57.460 --> 02:59.540\n not for free, not for $1 million.\n\n03:00.900 --> 03:04.140\n Our showing short clips of it results in the IOC\n\n03:04.140 --> 03:06.640\n taking it down, not demonetizing it,\n\n03:06.640 --> 03:09.200\n taking it down, blocking it.\n\n03:09.200 --> 03:13.100\n The IOC silences this amazing story of Travis Stevens\n\n03:13.100 --> 03:16.700\n of heartbreak that eventually led to triumph.\n\n03:16.700 --> 03:18.900\n And there are thousands of stories like it,\n\n03:18.900 --> 03:21.820\n stories that are supposed to inspire the world.\n\n03:22.780 --> 03:24.460\n To me and to billions of others,\n\n03:24.460 --> 03:26.740\n the Olympic games give a chance to celebrate\n\n03:26.740 --> 03:29.380\n and to be inspired by the greatest stories\n\n03:29.380 --> 03:32.180\n of human flourishing in the face of hardship\n\n03:32.180 --> 03:34.980\n and incredibly long odds or dominance\n\n03:34.980 --> 03:36.300\n in the pursuit of perfection\n\n03:36.300 --> 03:39.260\n at levels previously thought to be impossible.\n\n03:39.260 --> 03:43.660\n The Olympic games inspire kids like me to dream\n\n03:43.660 --> 03:46.160\n and to work hard to achieve in our own lives\n\n03:46.160 --> 03:49.100\n the same moments of magic and greatness,\n\n03:49.100 --> 03:53.580\n small or big, that the Olympic games reveal.\n\n03:53.580 --> 03:57.140\n I believe the members of the IOC are good people,\n\n03:57.140 --> 03:59.980\n but people who forgot the dream,\n\n03:59.980 --> 04:03.260\n the fire that was sparked and burned in their hearts\n\n04:03.260 --> 04:06.040\n when they first saw the Olympics as kids.\n\n04:06.040 --> 04:08.420\n They've allowed the gradual corruption\n\n04:08.420 --> 04:10.420\n of their own human spirit\n\n04:10.420 --> 04:13.900\n and thereby have robbed the world of this very fire,\n\n04:13.900 --> 04:16.180\n the fire of the Olympic torch,\n\n04:16.180 --> 04:19.380\n the fire that ought to burn in the eyes and hearts of kids\n\n04:19.380 --> 04:21.240\n watching the Olympics today,\n\n04:21.240 --> 04:24.540\n daring to dream, daring to be great.\n\n04:24.540 --> 04:27.820\n Please, please do better.\n\n04:27.820 --> 04:31.340\n The world needs you, the world needs the Olympic games.\n\n04:32.620 --> 04:35.660\n This is the Lux Friedman podcast\n\n04:35.660 --> 04:38.940\n and here's my conversation with Travis Stevens.\n\n04:40.020 --> 04:42.480\n Judo is a martial arts, a sport,\n\n04:42.480 --> 04:45.100\n a set of techniques, ideas, and philosophies.\n\n04:45.100 --> 04:48.620\n Can we start by maybe you giving a big picture overview\n\n04:48.620 --> 04:52.440\n of what is Judo to somebody who's like outside\n\n04:52.440 --> 04:54.780\n the whole spectrum of grappling sports?\n\n04:54.780 --> 04:57.820\n Yeah, Judo was originated in Japan\n\n04:57.820 --> 05:02.060\n that was used as a police tactic for self defense\n\n05:02.060 --> 05:05.180\n and subduing people.\n\n05:05.180 --> 05:07.980\n It's the art of being able to throw somebody to the ground\n\n05:07.980 --> 05:10.420\n and hold and control the situation.\n\n05:10.420 --> 05:14.060\n I think it's pretty much evolved since then though.\n\n05:14.060 --> 05:17.780\n You know, it's as you include like the sport aspect of it,\n\n05:17.780 --> 05:22.420\n it's grown to be something more and more dynamic\n\n05:22.420 --> 05:25.040\n and it's kind of gotten away from that.\n\n05:25.040 --> 05:28.980\n So the basics is people wear something called a gi,\n\n05:28.980 --> 05:33.260\n which I think nicely mimics like outdoor clothing,\n\n05:33.260 --> 05:37.080\n like a jacket and they start on the feet\n\n05:37.080 --> 05:40.760\n and they get to grip each other\n\n05:40.760 --> 05:45.040\n and the scoring works by the more badass the throw is,\n\n05:45.040 --> 05:46.440\n the more points you get,\n\n05:46.440 --> 05:51.440\n and if you throw the person big and hard on their back,\n\n05:52.800 --> 05:55.600\n you win the match and it's over and that's called an Ippon.\n\n05:55.600 --> 05:58.200\n Yeah, which is equivalent to a knockout.\n\n05:58.200 --> 06:01.120\n So I guess there's no knockdowns in Judo.\n\n06:01.120 --> 06:02.120\n We don't count those.\n\n06:02.120 --> 06:02.960\n Yeah.\n\n06:02.960 --> 06:05.880\n They gotta hit their back and they gotta hit it with force.\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:08.900\n And so there's a huge incentive for the big throws.\n\n06:08.900 --> 06:09.740\n Yeah.\n\n06:09.740 --> 06:14.740\n And there's also the drama of somebody catching you off guard\n\n06:15.600 --> 06:17.900\n with a surprise big throw and it's over.\n\n06:17.900 --> 06:21.120\n Yep, there's two ways of losing really.\n\n06:21.120 --> 06:25.280\n There's the, I saw this coming, right?\n\n06:25.280 --> 06:29.300\n Like you just, you see it, but you can't stop it.\n\n06:29.300 --> 06:32.980\n And those ones tend to be the ones you can live with.\n\n06:32.980 --> 06:35.120\n The ones that are like really hard to live with\n\n06:35.120 --> 06:37.320\n are the ones you never saw coming, right?\n\n06:37.320 --> 06:39.640\n Cause that just shows that that person\n\n06:39.640 --> 06:41.440\n has really outclassed you.\n\n06:41.440 --> 06:44.760\n Right, so there's like a set of, a small set of throws.\n\n06:44.760 --> 06:47.240\n Maybe we can go through them that are like,\n\n06:47.240 --> 06:49.920\n you saw it coming, but you couldn't do anything about it.\n\n06:49.920 --> 06:51.640\n And then there's the set of throws\n\n06:51.640 --> 06:53.560\n that are more like surprises.\n\n06:53.560 --> 06:55.360\n So first of all, the counters,\n\n06:55.360 --> 06:58.440\n or if you fake one thing and go the other way,\n\n06:58.440 --> 07:00.600\n then that's a surprise and it's like, oh shit.\n\n07:00.600 --> 07:03.560\n You off balance the person because they think\n\n07:03.560 --> 07:05.200\n you're going one way and then you go the other way.\n\n07:05.200 --> 07:06.640\n And then there's this, oh shit moment.\n\n07:06.640 --> 07:10.400\n All of a sudden your back is just slammed on the ground.\n\n07:10.400 --> 07:12.560\n One of the ones, I mean, you're good at many throws,\n\n07:12.560 --> 07:15.880\n but one of them is a, that I think reveals\n\n07:15.880 --> 07:19.640\n the beauty of judo is the foot sweep.\n\n07:19.640 --> 07:21.920\n There's something about the off balance and the timing\n\n07:21.920 --> 07:24.440\n that if you catch them right, all of a sudden,\n\n07:24.440 --> 07:26.840\n it's like I had the same feeling when I went skydiving,\n\n07:26.840 --> 07:29.620\n like all of a sudden the ground is not under you anymore.\n\n07:29.620 --> 07:31.420\n Yeah, and you just, you go weightlessness\n\n07:31.420 --> 07:33.320\n for like a split second and you realize\n\n07:33.320 --> 07:35.880\n you've lost like all control of your limbs.\n\n07:35.880 --> 07:38.480\n Like it's like zero gravity, right?\n\n07:38.480 --> 07:40.680\n Like you just, you can't turn, you can't rotate,\n\n07:40.680 --> 07:42.160\n you can't do much of anything.\n\n07:42.160 --> 07:44.080\n And then before you know it, you've hit the floor.\n\n07:44.080 --> 07:45.120\n Yeah.\n\n07:45.120 --> 07:48.120\n It's a cool feeling when you get thrown\n\n07:49.180 --> 07:51.760\n because you hope to do the same thing to another person.\n\n07:51.760 --> 07:54.720\n It's like, you just hit the ground hard\n\n07:54.720 --> 07:56.440\n because it's not, you didn't see it coming.\n\n07:56.440 --> 07:58.880\n It wasn't a big throw that got loaded up.\n\n07:58.880 --> 08:01.360\n It's like all of a sudden the surprise.\n\n08:01.360 --> 08:06.020\n And then like this, like feeling your back just slams\n\n08:06.020 --> 08:07.760\n and there's like the air is up.\n\n08:07.760 --> 08:09.960\n Yeah, and the worst is when you get hit twice\n\n08:09.960 --> 08:11.080\n with one throw, right?\n\n08:11.080 --> 08:14.040\n Because sometimes like the guy throwing you\n\n08:14.040 --> 08:15.360\n didn't expect you to leave either.\n\n08:15.360 --> 08:17.760\n So you hit and then that guy comes down\n\n08:17.760 --> 08:21.000\n like a second and a half later and it's like, boom, boom.\n\n08:21.000 --> 08:22.840\n And then the wind is just gone from you.\n\n08:22.840 --> 08:24.160\n Yeah.\n\n08:24.160 --> 08:25.040\n Those are the worst.\n\n08:25.040 --> 08:26.740\n And then there's the disappointment.\n\n08:26.740 --> 08:30.480\n Like then the intellectual, the cognitive part comes in\n\n08:30.480 --> 08:32.220\n where you're like, oh shit, I just lost.\n\n08:32.220 --> 08:33.060\n Yep.\n\n08:33.060 --> 08:37.120\n And you don't have like a connection to why, right?\n\n08:37.120 --> 08:38.140\n It's almost like you've just,\n\n08:38.140 --> 08:39.800\n like you didn't literally get a concussion.\n\n08:39.800 --> 08:43.040\n Like you understand and remember everything,\n\n08:43.040 --> 08:46.820\n but you can't figure out how this just happened, right?\n\n08:46.820 --> 08:49.160\n Those are the tough ones to deal with.\n\n08:49.160 --> 08:51.600\n Actually, have you had moments like that\n\n08:51.600 --> 08:53.160\n where you don't understand how it happened?\n\n08:53.160 --> 08:55.040\n You have to watch footage to understand what happened?\n\n08:55.040 --> 08:58.640\n Even when you watch it, you're just like, I don't get it.\n\n08:58.640 --> 09:02.280\n Like, why wasn't I in a position to stop this?\n\n09:03.440 --> 09:05.020\n It makes zero sense.\n\n09:06.020 --> 09:08.460\n Conceptually, when you watch it, you're like,\n\n09:08.460 --> 09:10.520\n I understand how to play defense.\n\n09:10.520 --> 09:14.760\n I understand, it looks like I'm in a defensive position,\n\n09:14.760 --> 09:18.520\n but at the end of the day, I still got thrown.\n\n09:18.520 --> 09:22.880\n Yeah, you were talking about, what is it, a 2008 match.\n\n09:22.880 --> 09:26.040\n You have a non traditional gripping style.\n\n09:26.040 --> 09:26.860\n Yeah.\n\n09:26.860 --> 09:27.700\n Is that accurate to say?\n\n09:27.700 --> 09:30.720\n And then you were going against another right handed player\n\n09:30.720 --> 09:33.960\n and then there was some kind of fake that he did\n\n09:33.960 --> 09:35.660\n and then he caught you.\n\n09:35.660 --> 09:36.500\n Yep.\n\n09:36.500 --> 09:38.600\n Can you describe the throw he caught you with?\n\n09:38.600 --> 09:41.860\n He caught me with a drop sale,\n\n09:41.860 --> 09:45.520\n but he kind of like, we were engaged.\n\n09:45.520 --> 09:46.760\n We were looking at each other\n\n09:46.760 --> 09:50.400\n and we were kind of at like a stalemate, right?\n\n09:50.400 --> 09:53.040\n He couldn't really advance, I couldn't really advance.\n\n09:53.040 --> 09:56.560\n And he kind of just let his gaze like wander off\n\n09:56.560 --> 09:58.400\n to the right, like he was looking at something.\n\n09:58.400 --> 10:01.000\n And then I kind of like, what's over there?\n\n10:01.000 --> 10:04.380\n And then I got thrown and it's like.\n\n10:04.380 --> 10:06.840\n So first of all, for people who don't know,\n\n10:06.840 --> 10:11.480\n Seio's Seinagi drop means when you drop to your knees\n\n10:11.480 --> 10:14.620\n and Seinagi is one of the fundamental throws of Judo.\n\n10:14.620 --> 10:18.720\n There's just a handful, but does that actually ever work?\n\n10:18.720 --> 10:22.520\n I always wondered that about like boxing or Judo.\n\n10:22.520 --> 10:25.240\n Does the head movement of the person work?\n\n10:25.240 --> 10:27.520\n Cause we're still like kind of dogs at heart.\n\n10:27.520 --> 10:29.520\n If you look somewhere with a dog,\n\n10:29.520 --> 10:31.720\n the dog is going to look that direction as well.\n\n10:31.720 --> 10:33.080\n Does that actually work ever?\n\n10:33.080 --> 10:37.220\n It does, but on a greater sense,\n\n10:37.220 --> 10:39.960\n what you try to do is not necessarily get\n\n10:39.960 --> 10:42.980\n like a physical reaction of a look,\n\n10:42.980 --> 10:45.480\n but a lull of security where like,\n\n10:45.480 --> 10:48.720\n they've almost like relaxed for that split second\n\n10:48.720 --> 10:52.720\n because you've lured them into like a sense of comfort.\n\n10:52.720 --> 10:55.400\n And then that's when you can strike.\n\n10:55.400 --> 10:57.680\n So you have this, speaking of Seinagi,\n\n10:57.680 --> 11:02.160\n you have this gigantic standing Seinagi.\n\n11:02.160 --> 11:05.240\n And you have a specific grip.\n\n11:05.240 --> 11:08.080\n One of our challenges is there's a large number of people\n\n11:08.080 --> 11:10.280\n that listen to the audio version of this.\n\n11:10.280 --> 11:13.200\n So we're gonna have to try to describe some of this stuff.\n\n11:13.200 --> 11:15.640\n I'll do my best to try to describe with words,\n\n11:15.640 --> 11:19.280\n but you have, you grip with your left hand\n\n11:19.280 --> 11:23.800\n on the lapel of the jacket or like that area.\n\n11:23.800 --> 11:27.080\n And there's kind of a lean into the person.\n\n11:27.080 --> 11:29.320\n And I suppose, is there a feeling of a lull there\n\n11:29.320 --> 11:31.240\n that you're trying to get to where you're just,\n\n11:31.240 --> 11:33.640\n it feels like you're both calmly dancing\n\n11:33.640 --> 11:36.260\n before you turn your hips and go in for the throw?\n\n11:36.260 --> 11:41.260\n I'm actually trying to create a sense of weightlessness\n\n11:43.560 --> 11:46.100\n for my lead leg, which would be my right leg.\n\n11:46.100 --> 11:51.100\n And a sense of resistance from my partner.\n\n11:52.840 --> 11:55.880\n So aren't you both kind of leaning into each other?\n\n11:55.880 --> 11:57.580\n And it creates like an A frame.\n\n11:58.520 --> 12:00.880\n But when the A frame is held together at the top half,\n\n12:00.880 --> 12:02.920\n which would be my left hand and their right hand\n\n12:02.920 --> 12:04.560\n posted on each other's chest,\n\n12:04.560 --> 12:06.600\n it means our legs are free to move\n\n12:06.600 --> 12:08.040\n and our hips are free to move.\n\n12:08.040 --> 12:10.700\n And they're not gonna feel your leg move.\n\n12:10.700 --> 12:12.040\n Because of the weightlessness.\n\n12:12.040 --> 12:14.200\n And is there a feeling like, for them,\n\n12:14.200 --> 12:16.280\n is there a feeling like nothing bad can happen here?\n\n12:16.280 --> 12:18.560\n We're all relaxed, everything's fine?\n\n12:18.560 --> 12:19.400\n Yeah.\n\n12:19.400 --> 12:21.360\n And then they're standing off at a funny angle\n\n12:21.360 --> 12:23.340\n and before they know it, I've spun\n\n12:23.340 --> 12:25.800\n and my back is on their chest and they can't go anywhere.\n\n12:25.800 --> 12:26.820\n Yeah.\n\n12:26.820 --> 12:27.660\n Yeah.\n\n12:27.660 --> 12:29.060\n How did you first develop that throw?\n\n12:29.060 --> 12:32.280\n So for people, it's called Ippon Seinagi,\n\n12:32.280 --> 12:36.880\n which means your right hand goes under their armpit area.\n\n12:36.880 --> 12:41.760\n And that's like a vice that connects you to them.\n\n12:41.760 --> 12:44.180\n And then they go on for the ride.\n\n12:44.180 --> 12:45.960\n The interesting thing with the standing one\n\n12:45.960 --> 12:49.760\n is as opposed to drop Seinagi version,\n\n12:49.760 --> 12:54.200\n the drop Seinagi, you kind of drop under them.\n\n12:54.200 --> 12:55.800\n And because there's a vice,\n\n12:55.800 --> 12:59.500\n they're like pulled under and like over.\n\n12:59.500 --> 13:00.500\n Yeah.\n\n13:00.500 --> 13:04.820\n With the standing one, I suppose there's some similar physics,\n\n13:04.820 --> 13:07.360\n but you're kind of loading them onto your hip.\n\n13:07.360 --> 13:11.080\n And so they're in the air while you're standing still.\n\n13:11.080 --> 13:15.460\n There's a sense in which they're like,\n\n13:15.460 --> 13:19.060\n you're lifting them above where they started.\n\n13:19.060 --> 13:19.900\n Yes.\n\n13:19.900 --> 13:22.260\n That's how you get the really big air.\n\n13:22.260 --> 13:23.100\n Yeah.\n\n13:23.100 --> 13:27.020\n If obviously, if everything is right.\n\n13:27.020 --> 13:28.780\n So how did you first develop that?\n\n13:28.780 --> 13:29.940\n How did you first?\n\n13:29.940 --> 13:32.980\n I first learned just learning like the very basics\n\n13:32.980 --> 13:35.460\n of the throw, you know, foot placement,\n\n13:35.460 --> 13:36.700\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n13:36.700 --> 13:41.300\n And then, you know, like anything, the basics are nice,\n\n13:41.300 --> 13:43.180\n but once you get good at the basics,\n\n13:43.180 --> 13:44.980\n it's very easy to stop,\n\n13:44.980 --> 13:47.460\n but it gives you a good like fundamental platform\n\n13:47.460 --> 13:51.440\n to learn off of and to expand off of.\n\n13:51.440 --> 13:54.860\n And then I expanded when I first started watching Koga,\n\n13:54.860 --> 13:56.220\n the new wind, right?\n\n13:56.220 --> 13:59.300\n Cause he's the one that first like introduced\n\n13:59.300 --> 14:02.180\n that split hip style Seinagi that I do.\n\n14:02.180 --> 14:06.300\n Once I learned that one,\n\n14:06.300 --> 14:11.020\n I built about eight different variations of Seio\n\n14:11.020 --> 14:13.300\n off that one start position.\n\n14:13.300 --> 14:15.660\n That way I could, regardless of your defense,\n\n14:15.660 --> 14:18.060\n I had an answer for a throw.\n\n14:18.060 --> 14:19.260\n So why that one though?\n\n14:19.260 --> 14:22.660\n Why, can you describe love to me, Travis Stevens?\n\n14:22.660 --> 14:25.320\n Why'd you fall in love with that throw in particular?\n\n14:26.260 --> 14:30.180\n It was really a sense of, you know,\n\n14:30.180 --> 14:32.740\n one of my shortcomings as a kid, like,\n\n14:32.740 --> 14:35.460\n I hate leg day in the gym.\n\n14:35.460 --> 14:37.120\n I hate it with a passion.\n\n14:37.120 --> 14:41.260\n I, if you asked me to do a squat, I'll get it done,\n\n14:41.260 --> 14:44.040\n but I will bitch and moan every step of the way.\n\n14:44.040 --> 14:44.880\n I hate it.\n\n14:44.880 --> 14:46.860\n I remember one time I was at the gym with my trainer\n\n14:46.860 --> 14:48.740\n and he goes, okay, we're going to do front squats.\n\n14:48.740 --> 14:50.500\n And I want you to put 225 on the bar.\n\n14:50.500 --> 14:52.800\n And I was like, I can't do that.\n\n14:52.800 --> 14:54.900\n And he was like, what do you mean you can't do that?\n\n14:54.900 --> 14:58.060\n And I go, I physically, I can't do that.\n\n14:58.060 --> 15:00.380\n And he was like, are you serious?\n\n15:00.380 --> 15:01.220\n And I go, yeah.\n\n15:01.220 --> 15:02.700\n So he's, he didn't believe me.\n\n15:02.700 --> 15:05.280\n We put 225 on the bar and I bottomed out.\n\n15:05.280 --> 15:06.900\n And then he was like, okay, let's go down to 185.\n\n15:06.900 --> 15:08.540\n And I was like, I can't do that.\n\n15:08.540 --> 15:10.260\n I just, that's not happening.\n\n15:10.260 --> 15:12.820\n You probably could, strength wise, you just refuse.\n\n15:12.820 --> 15:15.820\n I just mentally, I cannot wrap my head around like,\n\n15:15.820 --> 15:16.980\n this ain't happening.\n\n15:16.980 --> 15:17.820\n I'm not doing it.\n\n15:17.820 --> 15:21.780\n So I ended up with like 95 pounds on the bar.\n\n15:21.780 --> 15:23.900\n I got you at a front squat, no problem.\n\n15:23.900 --> 15:27.020\n By the way, body weight squats are rough too, psychologically.\n\n15:27.020 --> 15:29.420\n So yeah, I just, when it comes to my legs,\n\n15:29.420 --> 15:33.800\n like I want no part of like leg pressing,\n\n15:33.800 --> 15:35.500\n single leg squats, split squat,\n\n15:35.500 --> 15:36.980\n any of that, I want no part of it.\n\n15:36.980 --> 15:39.140\n So you think like the more traditional variants\n\n15:39.140 --> 15:42.460\n of Sanagi require you to have that leg strength,\n\n15:42.460 --> 15:43.420\n that mass.\n\n15:43.420 --> 15:45.120\n Like when you watch Japanese Judo players,\n\n15:45.120 --> 15:48.140\n like their thighs and their hips, they're thick.\n\n15:48.140 --> 15:50.060\n They got a lot of power there.\n\n15:50.060 --> 15:52.700\n So you're almost like always dropping a little bit\n\n15:52.700 --> 15:54.340\n into a squat position.\n\n15:54.340 --> 15:55.420\n For mine, never.\n\n15:55.420 --> 15:56.740\n No, no, no, not you, sorry.\n\n15:56.740 --> 15:58.100\n For the traditional ones.\n\n15:58.100 --> 15:58.940\n Yeah.\n\n15:58.940 --> 16:00.700\n And so the split hip,\n\n16:00.700 --> 16:03.980\n the split hip actually allows me to keep my legs straight.\n\n16:03.980 --> 16:05.460\n And the farther I split my legs,\n\n16:05.460 --> 16:07.300\n the lower my center of gravity goes.\n\n16:07.300 --> 16:08.800\n Now I don't need my legs.\n\n16:08.800 --> 16:09.640\n Yeah.\n\n16:09.640 --> 16:10.460\n Perfect.\n\n16:10.460 --> 16:11.300\n Love it.\n\n16:11.300 --> 16:12.120\n Let's do it.\n\n16:12.120 --> 16:12.960\n So that's the way you were thinking about it.\n\n16:12.960 --> 16:14.040\n Okay.\n\n16:14.040 --> 16:16.620\n But it's, you know, the interesting thing about it\n\n16:16.620 --> 16:19.500\n is because, you know, as I mentioned to you,\n\n16:19.500 --> 16:22.640\n I've gotten to Judo after first watching you\n\n16:22.640 --> 16:26.700\n in the Olympics and then watching Koga as well.\n\n16:26.700 --> 16:29.660\n And so you start imitating the people you foresee\n\n16:29.660 --> 16:31.660\n and then you take it to Judo coaches\n\n16:31.660 --> 16:32.660\n and they're like, no, no, no, no,\n\n16:32.660 --> 16:34.680\n that's the wrong way to do it.\n\n16:34.680 --> 16:36.260\n And happens all the time.\n\n16:36.260 --> 16:38.600\n It drives me nuts, drives me nuts.\n\n16:38.600 --> 16:41.900\n I was in Poland one time teaching a camp\n\n16:41.900 --> 16:46.460\n and I had two coaches anti coaching,\n\n16:46.460 --> 16:49.060\n telling their kids not to do Seio the way I do it\n\n16:49.060 --> 16:50.260\n because it never works.\n\n16:50.260 --> 16:51.100\n Yeah.\n\n16:51.100 --> 16:51.980\n It's crazy.\n\n16:51.980 --> 16:55.500\n How do you have the fortitude and the guts\n\n16:55.500 --> 16:58.140\n to just go on with a throw that's not traditional,\n\n16:58.140 --> 17:00.100\n a variant that's not traditional?\n\n17:01.880 --> 17:04.080\n If you think about it, you know,\n\n17:04.080 --> 17:08.540\n from a very basic like root of it,\n\n17:08.540 --> 17:11.180\n there's a philosophy and a mentality of Judo\n\n17:11.180 --> 17:13.380\n of how the throws work, right?\n\n17:13.380 --> 17:16.140\n There's a mechanical structure there of like,\n\n17:16.140 --> 17:18.220\n this makes sense.\n\n17:18.220 --> 17:21.000\n If I follow that principle, I can do anything I want.\n\n17:22.100 --> 17:23.320\n Nothing else matters.\n\n17:23.320 --> 17:25.580\n As long as we follow those core principles.\n\n17:25.580 --> 17:28.500\n So in the early days, even then,\n\n17:28.500 --> 17:29.900\n you were able to think on your own.\n\n17:29.900 --> 17:33.060\n Yeah, and I was able to develop a pattern\n\n17:33.060 --> 17:36.720\n for my foot placement based on my opponent's height.\n\n17:36.720 --> 17:39.860\n Because the number one thing any Judo coach would tell you\n\n17:39.860 --> 17:42.720\n is you need your center of gravity below yours.\n\n17:42.720 --> 17:45.380\n Well, now I know exactly where to put my feet\n\n17:45.380 --> 17:48.540\n because the shorter you are, the bigger the split\n\n17:48.540 --> 17:49.760\n because the lower I need to get.\n\n17:49.760 --> 17:52.580\n The taller you are, the less of a split I need.\n\n17:52.580 --> 17:53.620\n Is there something you could say\n\n17:53.620 --> 17:57.200\n about fundamental principles of Judo?\n\n17:57.200 --> 18:00.180\n Is there, over all that time,\n\n18:00.180 --> 18:02.740\n not over 20 years that you've been doing Judo,\n\n18:04.300 --> 18:06.020\n it's not approaching 30, is it?\n\n18:06.020 --> 18:09.500\n Yeah, it's getting there.\n\n18:09.500 --> 18:10.340\n Okay, it's getting there.\n\n18:10.340 --> 18:13.620\n We're a couple years away, but it's getting there.\n\n18:13.620 --> 18:17.100\n Is there some like principles that have emerged?\n\n18:17.100 --> 18:19.900\n Like you said, you have to have your center of gravity\n\n18:19.900 --> 18:21.140\n below theirs.\n\n18:21.140 --> 18:24.060\n Is there other kind of, both on the gripping side,\n\n18:24.060 --> 18:28.140\n the footwork side, leverage, anything you can speak to?\n\n18:28.140 --> 18:31.700\n There's some that have withstood like time,\n\n18:31.700 --> 18:35.340\n like you have to be able to get below\n\n18:35.340 --> 18:36.420\n their center of gravity\n\n18:36.420 --> 18:38.920\n because you have to be able to rotate them\n\n18:38.920 --> 18:40.680\n around their center of gravity.\n\n18:40.680 --> 18:43.000\n And then the other one is,\n\n18:43.000 --> 18:45.180\n that was always a principle when I was growing up\n\n18:45.180 --> 18:48.180\n and I didn't change until later on in my career was,\n\n18:48.180 --> 18:50.020\n you have to be able to pull.\n\n18:50.020 --> 18:53.820\n You need to be able to pull to get them off balance.\n\n18:53.820 --> 18:56.300\n But when you think about that statement as a whole,\n\n18:56.300 --> 18:59.540\n it ended with, they have to be off balance.\n\n18:59.540 --> 19:01.880\n I don't need to pull to get you off balance.\n\n19:01.880 --> 19:04.020\n I just need you off balance.\n\n19:04.020 --> 19:05.540\n And when you think about it that way,\n\n19:05.540 --> 19:08.520\n it allows you to open up the doors to,\n\n19:08.520 --> 19:11.040\n what do I need to do to get you off balance?\n\n19:11.040 --> 19:14.300\n I could push, pull, I could flinch, I could fake,\n\n19:14.300 --> 19:17.320\n and you could put yourself in your own off balance state.\n\n19:17.320 --> 19:22.160\n When you think about people who wrestle,\n\n19:22.160 --> 19:25.440\n if I fake shoot, it causes you to over lean forward,\n\n19:25.440 --> 19:27.280\n which means you're off balance.\n\n19:27.280 --> 19:29.360\n There's no pull, there's no push, there's no nothing.\n\n19:29.360 --> 19:32.420\n I just get a reaction that leaves the opportunity\n\n19:32.420 --> 19:34.640\n in the door open for an attack.\n\n19:34.640 --> 19:36.720\n And that off balance could be very subtle?\n\n19:36.720 --> 19:38.220\n Could be very subtle.\n\n19:38.220 --> 19:41.240\n And the better you get and the more skills you get,\n\n19:41.240 --> 19:42.620\n the less subtle it is.\n\n19:44.840 --> 19:46.980\n So we should also mention that there is something called\n\n19:46.980 --> 19:51.340\n forward throws, where you throw the person,\n\n19:52.740 --> 19:54.840\n they're gonna fly facing forward,\n\n19:54.840 --> 19:56.800\n they're gonna fly forward.\n\n19:56.800 --> 20:00.040\n And then a backward throw, they're gonna fly back.\n\n20:00.040 --> 20:02.400\n Yep, and then there's lateral,\n\n20:02.400 --> 20:05.640\n they actually go sideways over, like a cartwheel almost.\n\n20:05.640 --> 20:07.800\n Okay, so the forward throws,\n\n20:07.800 --> 20:09.400\n there's the one we've been talking about,\n\n20:09.400 --> 20:12.240\n which is Seinagi, and there's a bunch of different variants,\n\n20:12.240 --> 20:14.240\n Ippon, Marote, Seinagi.\n\n20:14.240 --> 20:16.920\n There's drop and there's standing versions of them.\n\n20:16.920 --> 20:20.560\n And that all, I don't know if there's a way to summarize it,\n\n20:20.560 --> 20:25.140\n but that's like as clean as getting your center of gravity\n\n20:25.140 --> 20:27.800\n under theirs as it gets.\n\n20:27.800 --> 20:30.520\n And then the rest is just gripping variations.\n\n20:30.520 --> 20:32.160\n I guess it's all gripping variations\n\n20:32.160 --> 20:33.560\n on all of these throws, but.\n\n20:34.520 --> 20:38.960\n And then there is, in terms of forward throws,\n\n20:38.960 --> 20:43.960\n there's the other big one in competition is Uchimata,\n\n20:43.960 --> 20:48.960\n which is, I don't know, we can try to explain that one.\n\n20:49.120 --> 20:52.880\n But it ends up being where one,\n\n20:52.880 --> 20:55.240\n you're standing on just one of your feet,\n\n20:55.240 --> 20:57.020\n and the other one is up in the air.\n\n20:57.020 --> 20:59.360\n And I don't know if you would put in that same category,\n\n20:59.360 --> 21:02.840\n Harai Goshi, like those kinds of throws\n\n21:02.840 --> 21:05.920\n where you're kind of a little bit single footed.\n\n21:05.920 --> 21:07.840\n Yeah, so there's two footed techniques\n\n21:07.840 --> 21:09.460\n and then there's single footed, yeah.\n\n21:09.460 --> 21:13.640\n Oh, Goshi, where it's like you're doing a mix\n\n21:13.640 --> 21:16.360\n between the Uchimata and the Seinagi.\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:17.200\n Yeah.\n\n21:17.200 --> 21:18.080\n It's a hug.\n\n21:18.080 --> 21:21.480\n You hug a person and then you turn your hips around\n\n21:21.480 --> 21:24.480\n such that you're now hugging facing the same direction.\n\n21:24.480 --> 21:25.840\n When it comes to forward throw,\n\n21:25.840 --> 21:29.520\n there's, regardless of the name of the throw\n\n21:29.520 --> 21:32.760\n or the gripping variation that you're using,\n\n21:32.760 --> 21:35.080\n the whole principle is how do I get this person\n\n21:35.080 --> 21:38.980\n to do a forward roll in midair and land on their back?\n\n21:40.240 --> 21:43.520\n The more of a forward roll I can get, the bigger the score.\n\n21:43.520 --> 21:46.120\n If I get like a quarter of a turn\n\n21:46.120 --> 21:47.280\n where like you land on your side\n\n21:47.280 --> 21:50.080\n and you don't go over your back, it's a half score.\n\n21:50.080 --> 21:50.920\n Yeah.\n\n21:50.920 --> 21:53.280\n But they all require me to get you\n\n21:53.280 --> 21:55.160\n to do that forward rolling action.\n\n21:55.160 --> 21:56.760\n So just if we think of one person,\n\n21:56.760 --> 22:00.840\n if they do this nice leap forward and they do a roll\n\n22:00.840 --> 22:03.080\n and their back nicely rolls over the ground,\n\n22:03.080 --> 22:04.600\n you're trying to do the exact same thing\n\n22:04.600 --> 22:06.000\n with you connected to them.\n\n22:06.000 --> 22:08.480\n Well, and if it's nice and it's smooth,\n\n22:08.480 --> 22:10.080\n it's probably not a full score.\n\n22:10.080 --> 22:14.000\n It needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact.\n\n22:15.100 --> 22:15.940\n Right?\n\n22:15.940 --> 22:16.960\n So if you think of a drop, say Nagi,\n\n22:16.960 --> 22:21.680\n if I'm moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders\n\n22:21.680 --> 22:24.880\n and there's no direct impact, it's only a half score.\n\n22:24.880 --> 22:25.720\n Right.\n\n22:25.720 --> 22:27.120\n They want the force.\n\n22:27.120 --> 22:28.900\n The force, the violence.\n\n22:28.900 --> 22:29.740\n Yes.\n\n22:29.740 --> 22:30.560\n It's good.\n\n22:30.560 --> 22:31.400\n Okay.\n\n22:31.400 --> 22:36.400\n So then in terms of backward throws, the traditional ones,\n\n22:36.400 --> 22:41.400\n there's stuff where you trip them from outside their body,\n\n22:41.480 --> 22:43.360\n like Osoto gari.\n\n22:43.360 --> 22:46.800\n It's a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg\n\n22:46.800 --> 22:51.280\n and you trip them, but your hook goes outside of their legs.\n\n22:51.280 --> 22:54.920\n And then there's the trips from inside their body.\n\n22:54.920 --> 22:58.040\n There's a one foot is called kuchi gari\n\n22:58.040 --> 23:00.960\n and then the other is ochi gari, it doesn't matter.\n\n23:00.960 --> 23:03.640\n The most important thing is outside and inside.\n\n23:03.640 --> 23:07.280\n Inside and then there's like,\n\n23:07.280 --> 23:08.920\n I don't even know how you throw them sideways\n\n23:08.920 --> 23:09.800\n except foot sweeps.\n\n23:09.800 --> 23:11.200\n And then there's the foot sweeps\n\n23:11.200 --> 23:14.920\n where you can sweep one of their legs from out of them\n\n23:14.920 --> 23:17.180\n or both their legs at the same time.\n\n23:17.180 --> 23:20.440\n And like we're talking about this kind of is\n\n23:20.440 --> 23:24.720\n when timed perfectly, it's effortless for everybody involved\n\n23:24.720 --> 23:29.720\n and the ending, like you said, is big, dramatic and violent.\n\n23:30.000 --> 23:31.560\n Yeah.\n\n23:31.560 --> 23:33.360\n Is there other kind of, oh yeah.\n\n23:33.360 --> 23:35.160\n There's a sacrifice techniques.\n\n23:36.480 --> 23:38.040\n There's a bunch of them.\n\n23:38.040 --> 23:41.900\n And that ultimately the variations have to do with gripping,\n\n23:41.900 --> 23:46.080\n but you're basically you, the attacker fall onto your back,\n\n23:46.080 --> 23:49.920\n sticking your legs somewhere onto their body,\n\n23:49.920 --> 23:52.560\n which is like this fulcrum over which they fly\n\n23:52.560 --> 23:54.560\n and do that same kind of roll that you mentioned.\n\n23:54.560 --> 23:56.880\n You basically sacrifice your back to the mat\n\n23:56.880 --> 24:00.040\n in order to throw them into that circular pattern.\n\n24:00.040 --> 24:01.580\n So they hit their back.\n\n24:01.580 --> 24:02.720\n Sometimes we use a foot,\n\n24:02.720 --> 24:04.040\n sometimes we don't.\n\n24:04.040 --> 24:06.540\n And so we should probably say,\n\n24:06.540 --> 24:09.440\n it's okay for you to go onto your back\n\n24:09.440 --> 24:12.240\n as long as you're clearly demonstrating control\n\n24:12.240 --> 24:14.080\n over the other person's body.\n\n24:14.080 --> 24:14.920\n Correct.\n\n24:14.920 --> 24:18.000\n You can't go to your back in the same direction\n\n24:18.000 --> 24:22.140\n that your opponent is trying to put you to your back.\n\n24:22.140 --> 24:23.500\n You have to go the other way\n\n24:23.500 --> 24:27.960\n or you have to initiate you going to your own back.\n\n24:27.960 --> 24:29.280\n Right.\n\n24:29.280 --> 24:30.340\n Like clearly.\n\n24:30.340 --> 24:33.600\n And then there's all the counters\n\n24:33.600 --> 24:37.440\n which almost kind of have a whole group of their own,\n\n24:37.440 --> 24:41.060\n even though they have echoes of the same types of techniques,\n\n24:41.060 --> 24:43.220\n it seems like they're their own whole thing.\n\n24:43.220 --> 24:45.320\n Yeah, but they follow the same principles.\n\n24:45.320 --> 24:47.680\n It's just most counters.\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:51.880\n Like if you wanted to counter Ennuchi Mata, for example,\n\n24:51.880 --> 24:54.520\n you're trying to throw me in a somersault\n\n24:54.520 --> 24:56.540\n over my right shoulder.\n\n24:56.540 --> 24:58.380\n Therefore, I would counter you\n\n24:58.380 --> 25:01.760\n by throwing you over your left shoulder.\n\n25:01.760 --> 25:03.760\n It goes in the opposite shoulder direction,\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:06.920\n but in the same somersault idea.\n\n25:06.920 --> 25:09.500\n And there used to be, I already at this point,\n\n25:09.500 --> 25:13.560\n forget the years, but it might be before the 2012 Olympics\n\n25:13.560 --> 25:17.280\n where they banned, you used to be allowed to grab legs\n\n25:17.280 --> 25:19.440\n in the same way you do in wrestling.\n\n25:19.440 --> 25:21.400\n So you have basically all the techniques\n\n25:21.400 --> 25:24.760\n you would have in wrestling available to you\n\n25:24.760 --> 25:26.120\n if you would like.\n\n25:26.120 --> 25:26.960\n Yeah.\n\n25:26.960 --> 25:28.920\n It's just that some of the techniques in wrestling\n\n25:28.920 --> 25:30.040\n are not that effective\n\n25:30.040 --> 25:32.800\n for getting your opponent to their back.\n\n25:32.800 --> 25:34.720\n Wrestlers wanna take the other person down\n\n25:34.720 --> 25:36.880\n in any way possible and have control.\n\n25:36.880 --> 25:38.760\n Judo wants to take you down, like we said,\n\n25:38.760 --> 25:41.400\n in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground.\n\n25:41.400 --> 25:42.760\n Yeah, it has to be to the back.\n\n25:42.760 --> 25:44.800\n A lot of wrestling takedowns happen\n\n25:44.800 --> 25:49.040\n because they get behind them and then they parterre out.\n\n25:49.040 --> 25:54.040\n Yeah, so, but Judo banned all touching of the legs,\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:57.160\n which is a very dramatic change at the sport.\n\n25:57.160 --> 25:58.480\n But after 2012.\n\n25:58.480 --> 25:59.920\n After, it was after 2012?\n\n25:59.920 --> 26:00.760\n It was.\n\n26:00.760 --> 26:03.120\n In 2012, so 2008, I fought the games\n\n26:03.120 --> 26:05.280\n and everything was free.\n\n26:05.280 --> 26:07.920\n In 2012, we could only touch the legs\n\n26:07.920 --> 26:12.920\n as a defensive action or in response to an attack.\n\n26:13.800 --> 26:17.680\n So I could try to throw you with a normal throw\n\n26:17.680 --> 26:20.400\n and then when you try to counter, I could grab your leg.\n\n26:20.400 --> 26:21.240\n Right.\n\n26:21.240 --> 26:24.240\n So there had to be a secondary technique.\n\n26:24.240 --> 26:27.200\n And didn't, like, didn't they disqualify\n\n26:27.200 --> 26:29.200\n on a first offense?\n\n26:29.200 --> 26:31.360\n First offense was a direct disqualification,\n\n26:31.360 --> 26:35.760\n which happened at the 2012 games to the 57 Brazilian\n\n26:35.760 --> 26:37.560\n who won in 16.\n\n26:37.560 --> 26:40.200\n She was DQed and I think the quarters.\n\n26:40.200 --> 26:44.000\n And it was like, I wouldn't say it was blatant\n\n26:44.000 --> 26:48.240\n as much as I don't think the act changed the outcome\n\n26:48.240 --> 26:50.040\n of the match had they not disqualified her.\n\n26:50.040 --> 26:51.400\n So that's not that dramatic.\n\n26:51.400 --> 26:54.920\n And by the way, you say 57, that refers to weight divisions\n\n26:54.920 --> 26:58.160\n and that's in kilograms and kilograms is the measure\n\n26:58.160 --> 27:00.200\n of weight that the rest of the world uses\n\n27:00.200 --> 27:02.400\n and the United States does not.\n\n27:02.400 --> 27:07.320\n So, and there's, we should say the divisions for guys,\n\n27:08.360 --> 27:11.120\n I don't know what the 70, I don't know if the lower level,\n\n27:11.120 --> 27:11.960\n 60.\n\n27:11.960 --> 27:16.960\n 60, 66, 73, 81, 90, 100 and heavyweight,\n\n27:17.680 --> 27:19.200\n which has no ceiling.\n\n27:19.200 --> 27:21.120\n No ceiling, as we'll talk about.\n\n27:21.120 --> 27:22.120\n It's an important distinction.\n\n27:22.120 --> 27:24.240\n Yeah, it is an important distinction.\n\n27:26.760 --> 27:30.600\n And you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms.\n\n27:30.600 --> 27:31.960\n All of it.\n\n27:31.960 --> 27:33.280\n All, you never did 73.\n\n27:33.280 --> 27:34.640\n I never did 73.\n\n27:34.640 --> 27:36.840\n Well, you had to cut big for 81 anyway,\n\n27:36.840 --> 27:39.720\n especially towards the end of my career, yeah.\n\n27:39.720 --> 27:40.560\n Okay.\n\n27:41.400 --> 27:43.200\n I overly grew into the division.\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:47.640\n What's, I'm trying to remember, is it about 180 pounds?\n\n27:47.640 --> 27:49.720\n 178.6, I think.\n\n27:49.720 --> 27:52.240\n And you have to weigh in with the gear.\n\n27:52.240 --> 27:53.680\n No, nothing.\n\n27:53.680 --> 27:54.880\n You're not allowed to wear anything\n\n27:54.880 --> 27:56.680\n except for your underwear, weigh in.\n\n27:56.680 --> 27:58.880\n Confusing digits, that's right, that's right, that's right.\n\n27:58.880 --> 28:00.200\n That's which is very nice.\n\n28:02.160 --> 28:04.720\n Okay, so we, would you say we covered\n\n28:04.720 --> 28:06.400\n most of the throws or no?\n\n28:07.720 --> 28:10.000\n So there's the forward and the backward,\n\n28:10.000 --> 28:12.680\n there's the sacrifice throws and the counters.\n\n28:12.680 --> 28:13.520\n Yep.\n\n28:13.520 --> 28:15.280\n And then there's the leg grabs.\n\n28:15.280 --> 28:17.880\n And we should say for the leg grabs that were effective,\n\n28:17.880 --> 28:20.480\n it's like the big pickups\n\n28:20.480 --> 28:21.880\n where you just kind of pick them up\n\n28:21.880 --> 28:24.120\n and try to figure out once they're in the air\n\n28:24.120 --> 28:25.520\n what the heck to do with their body\n\n28:25.520 --> 28:26.840\n to get them to the ground.\n\n28:26.840 --> 28:28.720\n You just kind of figure it out as you go.\n\n28:28.720 --> 28:30.560\n I think the really nice one\n\n28:30.560 --> 28:33.800\n that was to me heartbreaking as a fantasy go\n\n28:33.800 --> 28:37.120\n is I guess what's called a fireman's carry,\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:42.120\n which is, it does lead to judo like beautiful throws.\n\n28:42.120 --> 28:45.280\n And the fact that that was gone is,\n\n28:45.280 --> 28:47.440\n that one I missed a little bit,\n\n28:47.440 --> 28:50.600\n but then a bunch of people I guess came up with the variance\n\n28:50.600 --> 28:52.920\n where you don't need to grab the leg.\n\n28:52.920 --> 28:57.160\n It's definitely not as effective as being able to grab it,\n\n28:57.160 --> 28:59.800\n but I'm also on the side of the fence\n\n28:59.800 --> 29:02.080\n having competed in all three.\n\n29:02.080 --> 29:04.280\n It was definitely better for the sport\n\n29:04.280 --> 29:07.240\n to remove it as a whole.\n\n29:07.240 --> 29:08.560\n It's probably good to cover sort of\n\n29:08.560 --> 29:10.960\n the whole spectrum of rules of judo\n\n29:10.960 --> 29:12.440\n is there's groundwork.\n\n29:12.440 --> 29:15.200\n So you do all this stuff on the feet\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:16.680\n where you're trying to murder each other\n\n29:16.680 --> 29:18.000\n with a giant throw.\n\n29:18.000 --> 29:21.120\n But then if the throw doesn't succeed,\n\n29:21.120 --> 29:23.000\n you go to the ground and you stay in the ground\n\n29:23.000 --> 29:25.320\n for some amount of time, like short amount of time.\n\n29:25.320 --> 29:27.960\n You have to move quickly, you have to be attacking.\n\n29:27.960 --> 29:30.680\n And two of the ways you can win\n\n29:30.680 --> 29:32.880\n is similar to people who do jiu jitsu\n\n29:32.880 --> 29:36.720\n is you can submit them, chokes, arm breaks,\n\n29:36.720 --> 29:39.320\n all that kind of stuff, no footlocks.\n\n29:39.320 --> 29:43.320\n And you can also pin them,\n\n29:43.320 --> 29:44.720\n which is get around their legs.\n\n29:44.720 --> 29:47.960\n And this is very, no, this is not like wrestling.\n\n29:47.960 --> 29:50.320\n You have to actually get around their legs\n\n29:50.320 --> 29:53.440\n and pin them in what in jiu jitsu is called\n\n29:53.440 --> 29:55.400\n side control mount, all kinds of ways\n\n29:55.400 --> 29:57.480\n that doesn't involve their legs.\n\n29:57.480 --> 29:59.000\n And then you pin them for like whatever,\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:00.320\n 20 seconds, 25 seconds.\n\n30:00.320 --> 30:01.840\n Yeah, 20 seconds now.\n\n30:01.840 --> 30:04.640\n I think the distinction is their back\n\n30:04.640 --> 30:06.520\n has to be facing the mat.\n\n30:06.520 --> 30:08.160\n You have to be past their legs\n\n30:08.160 --> 30:12.000\n and your chest has to be on the same plane as theirs.\n\n30:12.000 --> 30:14.120\n So it doesn't have to necessarily be on top,\n\n30:14.120 --> 30:16.560\n but it has to be on the same plane.\n\n30:16.560 --> 30:20.000\n And all of this is, I think different sports\n\n30:20.000 --> 30:21.240\n have different versions of this,\n\n30:21.240 --> 30:23.600\n but it's like an approximation\n\n30:23.600 --> 30:25.680\n of what dominance looks like.\n\n30:25.680 --> 30:29.280\n So pin and wrestling is dominating your opponent.\n\n30:29.280 --> 30:31.320\n Presumably if you were in a street fight,\n\n30:31.320 --> 30:34.160\n that position allows you to then do a lot of damage.\n\n30:34.160 --> 30:35.840\n Obviously submissions is dominance\n\n30:35.840 --> 30:40.480\n cause you're breaking their arm or choking them to unconscious.\n\n30:40.480 --> 30:42.520\n And then obviously the throw,\n\n30:42.520 --> 30:44.800\n which is not often talked about,\n\n30:44.800 --> 30:47.920\n but like if you talk about a street fight situation,\n\n30:47.920 --> 30:51.680\n a throw is like the best way to murder somebody.\n\n30:52.560 --> 30:54.360\n Like this could end anyone's life.\n\n30:54.360 --> 30:55.360\n Yes.\n\n30:55.360 --> 30:56.800\n It's terrifying actually.\n\n30:56.800 --> 30:59.400\n So, okay, so these are all elements of dominance.\n\n31:00.480 --> 31:03.040\n So going back to set of principles,\n\n31:03.040 --> 31:06.840\n you were mentioning getting your center of mass under theirs,\n\n31:06.840 --> 31:10.760\n which I think applies for type of like the forward\n\n31:10.760 --> 31:13.200\n say Nagi throws, is there other stuff?\n\n31:14.440 --> 31:15.960\n Oh, so you mentioned off balance.\n\n31:15.960 --> 31:17.680\n Yeah, there's the off balance one\n\n31:17.680 --> 31:21.280\n where you can either pull to get an off balance\n\n31:21.280 --> 31:24.080\n or you can give way to the force,\n\n31:24.080 --> 31:26.000\n which can also lead to an off balance.\n\n31:27.600 --> 31:30.560\n You can amplify somebody's force to,\n\n31:30.560 --> 31:34.480\n so for example, if you push me,\n\n31:34.480 --> 31:39.480\n you expect a certain reaction that you're ready for.\n\n31:39.520 --> 31:42.200\n But if you push me and I pull you,\n\n31:42.200 --> 31:44.800\n now you didn't expect that much force coming out of you.\n\n31:44.800 --> 31:46.320\n Therefore you're off balance.\n\n31:47.480 --> 31:50.560\n The thing that's distinctly recognizable about Judo\n\n31:51.440 --> 31:53.680\n is like when done at the highest level,\n\n31:54.960 --> 31:59.960\n like it seems effortless when the big throw happens.\n\n31:59.960 --> 32:01.680\n Like that's just, it doesn't,\n\n32:01.680 --> 32:04.520\n there is no other sport like it in the combat sports\n\n32:04.520 --> 32:07.720\n where it's like when the timing is right,\n\n32:07.720 --> 32:09.240\n everything just is perfect.\n\n32:09.240 --> 32:10.880\n I think you get that out of my mate\n\n32:10.880 --> 32:15.880\n and boxing sometimes when this is a perfect strike,\n\n32:15.920 --> 32:19.760\n just like, but it's not just like a hard hit.\n\n32:19.760 --> 32:23.680\n It's like, it's almost like with Conor McGregor and Aldo,\n\n32:23.680 --> 32:25.640\n for example, when you just catch him just right.\n\n32:25.640 --> 32:26.480\n Just right.\n\n32:26.480 --> 32:28.440\n You didn't look like you hit him that hard,\n\n32:28.440 --> 32:29.640\n but you hit him just right.\n\n32:29.640 --> 32:33.000\n And then you get to see this all the time in Judo.\n\n32:33.000 --> 32:34.120\n It's fascinating.\n\n32:34.120 --> 32:36.400\n And so the beginning part of that\n\n32:36.400 --> 32:38.360\n is because there's a jacket,\n\n32:38.360 --> 32:40.840\n there's also this whole thing that you're a master of,\n\n32:40.840 --> 32:43.480\n which is like, which is gripping.\n\n32:43.480 --> 32:46.200\n So is there something you could say about,\n\n32:46.200 --> 32:48.840\n are there some fundamental principles of gripping\n\n32:48.840 --> 32:50.200\n that you can speak to?\n\n32:50.200 --> 32:52.160\n Like what the hell is gripping?\n\n32:52.160 --> 32:56.000\n Gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent\n\n32:56.000 --> 32:59.560\n in such a way where you have the ability to be offensive\n\n32:59.560 --> 33:03.720\n and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time.\n\n33:05.200 --> 33:08.880\n And it's a distinction because I can hold you\n\n33:08.880 --> 33:13.240\n in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive,\n\n33:13.240 --> 33:16.000\n but if you can take a purely defensive grip\n\n33:16.000 --> 33:19.240\n and then I can't be offensive, we are no longer gripping.\n\n33:19.240 --> 33:20.520\n We are holding each other.\n\n33:21.720 --> 33:22.560\n Right.\n\n33:22.560 --> 33:23.400\n Right.\n\n33:23.400 --> 33:26.360\n And so like that would be the act of being able to grip\n\n33:26.360 --> 33:30.960\n is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you,\n\n33:30.960 --> 33:34.400\n and I can play both offense and defense at the same time\n\n33:34.400 --> 33:36.960\n where you can only play defense.\n\n33:36.960 --> 33:40.200\n So Donaher talks about like Jiu Jitsu that way,\n\n33:40.200 --> 33:41.040\n and not that way,\n\n33:41.040 --> 33:43.520\n but maybe you can see if there's a distinction.\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:45.400\n So you have a set of weapons.\n\n33:45.400 --> 33:47.320\n The other person has a set of weapons.\n\n33:47.320 --> 33:50.640\n You wanna sort of maximize the use of your weapons\n\n33:50.640 --> 33:54.720\n and shut down the set of weapons that they have.\n\n33:54.720 --> 33:57.680\n Do you see gripping the same way on the feet?\n\n33:57.680 --> 34:00.760\n I do if we wanna include body positioning\n\n34:00.760 --> 34:01.720\n with our gripping.\n\n34:03.280 --> 34:05.040\n Because I can give you any grip you want\n\n34:05.040 --> 34:06.400\n and you still can't throw me.\n\n34:06.400 --> 34:08.720\n Because I can put myself in a position\n\n34:08.720 --> 34:11.320\n that nullifies your ability to use those grips\n\n34:11.320 --> 34:13.120\n in a successful way.\n\n34:13.120 --> 34:16.160\n And those, would you say the hips are critical to that\n\n34:16.160 --> 34:17.080\n or is it everything?\n\n34:17.080 --> 34:21.120\n Hips, shoulders, chin position, head position,\n\n34:21.120 --> 34:22.760\n the angle of your foot.\n\n34:22.760 --> 34:24.600\n Yeah, where you lean.\n\n34:24.600 --> 34:25.640\n Wow, okay.\n\n34:25.640 --> 34:28.920\n And so, and there's a bunch of places you can grip.\n\n34:28.920 --> 34:31.720\n Obviously, if people like kind of think of a jacket,\n\n34:31.720 --> 34:33.880\n like there's a bunch of places you can grip\n\n34:33.880 --> 34:35.000\n that are interesting.\n\n34:35.000 --> 34:37.240\n So you can grip on the collar,\n\n34:37.240 --> 34:38.960\n you can grip on the sleeves,\n\n34:38.960 --> 34:41.840\n you can grip like the elbow joint.\n\n34:41.840 --> 34:44.160\n And then you could do those bad ass,\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:48.080\n like Eastern European, Georgian, over the back.\n\n34:48.080 --> 34:50.800\n Over the back, over the opposite sides of the heads.\n\n34:50.800 --> 34:52.440\n The Koreans that grab on one side\n\n34:52.440 --> 34:54.880\n around the head with their hands together.\n\n34:54.880 --> 34:58.080\n There's something really nice about just those,\n\n34:58.080 --> 35:00.600\n I mean, especially George just keeps throwing that hand.\n\n35:00.600 --> 35:02.920\n Just over the person and just,\n\n35:02.920 --> 35:05.600\n you're not actually gripping a belt or anything.\n\n35:05.600 --> 35:08.240\n You're gripping just the entirety of like,\n\n35:08.240 --> 35:09.600\n as opposed to being all nice\n\n35:09.600 --> 35:11.160\n and I'm gonna grab this part of the jacket,\n\n35:11.160 --> 35:12.400\n this part of the jacket.\n\n35:12.400 --> 35:15.720\n You're just like taking the whole fucking jacket\n\n35:15.720 --> 35:17.840\n and just launching somebody.\n\n35:17.840 --> 35:21.160\n For those people that can't picture judo,\n\n35:21.160 --> 35:23.000\n think about it in like,\n\n35:23.000 --> 35:26.240\n if you understood like what a boxing match looks like,\n\n35:26.240 --> 35:29.040\n and you thought about that as like traditional gripping,\n\n35:29.040 --> 35:31.880\n when you throw like a Russian grip over the back,\n\n35:31.880 --> 35:33.160\n that's more like a hockey fight.\n\n35:33.160 --> 35:36.240\n Like I'm just grabbing you and we're just gonna,\n\n35:36.240 --> 35:38.000\n we're gonna be throwing punches left and right.\n\n35:38.000 --> 35:39.960\n Cause when we have that grip,\n\n35:39.960 --> 35:41.840\n somebody has to get thrown.\n\n35:41.840 --> 35:44.880\n There's no, we don't walk around with this grip.\n\n35:44.880 --> 35:47.880\n It's go time once somebody throws it.\n\n35:47.880 --> 35:52.040\n To me, as a fan and sort of amateur practitioner,\n\n35:53.120 --> 35:55.880\n there's two styles of Olympic level judo.\n\n35:55.880 --> 35:59.480\n One is where you're trying not to get thrown.\n\n35:59.480 --> 36:02.040\n And the other is where you're trying to throw.\n\n36:04.080 --> 36:06.720\n More specifically, when you're trying not to get thrown,\n\n36:06.720 --> 36:09.160\n there's like the strategy that you're using gripping\n\n36:09.160 --> 36:13.160\n to nullify their offense and all those kinds of stuff here.\n\n36:13.160 --> 36:15.720\n You're being very clever and strategic and all that,\n\n36:15.720 --> 36:17.360\n maybe using conditioning.\n\n36:17.360 --> 36:21.280\n And then there's people who just like step in the pocket\n\n36:21.280 --> 36:23.960\n and they almost don't care if they're getting thrown\n\n36:23.960 --> 36:24.960\n cause they have the confidence\n\n36:24.960 --> 36:27.120\n that they're gonna throw first.\n\n36:27.120 --> 36:29.080\n And those, like there's a clear distinction\n\n36:29.080 --> 36:31.280\n between the people that do one or the other.\n\n36:31.280 --> 36:35.240\n And I think both can be done extremely successfully\n\n36:35.240 --> 36:36.440\n at the highest level.\n\n36:36.440 --> 36:38.600\n It's just like, obviously you admire the people\n\n36:38.600 --> 36:40.360\n that step in the pocket.\n\n36:40.360 --> 36:42.160\n And I think when you look at the people\n\n36:42.160 --> 36:45.680\n who do judo the best,\n\n36:45.680 --> 36:49.240\n like if we wanna talk about like the top 10%\n\n36:49.240 --> 36:52.040\n of the people who would compete at the games,\n\n36:52.040 --> 36:53.640\n they do both.\n\n36:53.640 --> 36:57.160\n And they do both really well, but they favor one.\n\n36:58.360 --> 37:01.200\n Because if you look at a player like\n\n37:02.600 --> 37:05.160\n Lutepe Tilliani of Georgia, for example,\n\n37:05.160 --> 37:07.520\n there's a guy that stands in the pocket.\n\n37:07.520 --> 37:09.520\n But we can find numerous occasions\n\n37:09.520 --> 37:11.760\n where he's hustled some people\n\n37:11.760 --> 37:13.640\n for like a short period of time\n\n37:13.640 --> 37:17.320\n to get out of scenarios, to elongate the match,\n\n37:17.320 --> 37:19.040\n to make somebody tired.\n\n37:19.040 --> 37:21.320\n So you want both sides of the coin,\n\n37:21.320 --> 37:24.760\n but you better pick the one that 80% of your strategy\n\n37:24.760 --> 37:26.000\n is gonna be built around.\n\n37:27.120 --> 37:28.480\n Sorry for the romantic question,\n\n37:28.480 --> 37:30.240\n but I talked to Dan Gable\n\n37:30.240 --> 37:33.600\n and he always looked to the Russians\n\n37:33.600 --> 37:37.280\n as the artists in wrestling.\n\n37:37.280 --> 37:39.480\n And he always wanted to be an artist.\n\n37:39.480 --> 37:44.160\n But I think he's known for being that sort of guts,\n\n37:44.160 --> 37:46.080\n aggression, mental toughness guy,\n\n37:46.080 --> 37:49.080\n but he always was drawn to the artistry of wrestling.\n\n37:49.080 --> 37:52.440\n It's hard to know when you just watch you,\n\n37:52.440 --> 37:54.040\n because it looks like you're aggressive\n\n37:54.040 --> 37:56.360\n and you got the guts and the mental toughness,\n\n37:56.360 --> 37:58.720\n but there's also obviously a mastery of technique.\n\n37:58.720 --> 38:01.800\n Which would you lean towards in terms of\n\n38:01.800 --> 38:03.680\n what accounts for your success\n\n38:03.680 --> 38:05.200\n and just the way you approach judo?\n\n38:05.200 --> 38:09.760\n Is it the guts, the aggression, the mental toughness,\n\n38:09.760 --> 38:14.760\n or is it the mastery of technique, the artistry?\n\n38:15.000 --> 38:17.600\n Mine would be my aggressiveness\n\n38:17.600 --> 38:20.400\n if I'm gonna pick those two areas.\n\n38:23.120 --> 38:25.080\n But I think there's a third area in there\n\n38:25.080 --> 38:28.160\n that I would put myself in where I'm more of a strategist.\n\n38:29.160 --> 38:31.360\n I look at all of my opponents\n\n38:31.360 --> 38:34.800\n and all I ever see is their faults.\n\n38:34.800 --> 38:37.880\n And the way I do judo is built around their faults.\n\n38:39.720 --> 38:42.920\n And it's just, I put myself in scenarios\n\n38:42.920 --> 38:45.920\n where I don't even know how I'm gonna win.\n\n38:45.920 --> 38:48.760\n But what I've done in those scenarios is\n\n38:48.760 --> 38:51.400\n I've made it very difficult for you to win.\n\n38:53.200 --> 38:55.160\n And then I figure out the rest as I go.\n\n38:56.600 --> 38:59.120\n Like how do you study an opponent?\n\n38:59.120 --> 39:00.880\n Are there bins you can put them in?\n\n39:00.880 --> 39:04.600\n Like there's a lefty and a righty or this kind of stuff.\n\n39:04.600 --> 39:06.840\n How many bins are there in judo in your mind\n\n39:06.840 --> 39:09.880\n that you put your opponents in?\n\n39:09.880 --> 39:11.760\n Yeah, there's probably about 20.\n\n39:12.720 --> 39:15.440\n There's like certain players who you could put\n\n39:15.440 --> 39:18.240\n in a category of like, they're only good\n\n39:18.240 --> 39:21.720\n for the first two thirds of the match.\n\n39:21.720 --> 39:23.760\n After that, they turn into a different player\n\n39:23.760 --> 39:27.320\n where they're either falling into a sense of panic\n\n39:27.320 --> 39:28.680\n or uncertainty.\n\n39:28.680 --> 39:31.800\n And you can, if you were to take a video clip\n\n39:31.800 --> 39:33.720\n of let's say Church's Philly, right?\n\n39:33.720 --> 39:37.400\n They got Georgia and I beat in the Olympic semi.\n\n39:37.400 --> 39:39.000\n He's somebody that would beat you\n\n39:39.000 --> 39:40.800\n in the first three minutes.\n\n39:40.800 --> 39:43.360\n And if you clipped out all of his matches\n\n39:43.360 --> 39:46.480\n and you only watched the first three minutes\n\n39:46.480 --> 39:49.360\n of every match, you would see one style.\n\n39:49.360 --> 39:51.880\n If you found all the matches where he got taken\n\n39:51.880 --> 39:56.880\n into the last minute and he wasn't winning by a major score,\n\n39:56.880 --> 39:59.120\n you would see a completely different fighter.\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:02.320\n And so going into like my Olympic semi,\n\n40:02.320 --> 40:04.800\n I put him into that category of like,\n\n40:04.800 --> 40:07.640\n I wanna get to this guy, cause this guy is beautiful.\n\n40:08.800 --> 40:10.720\n The trick is, how do you get there?\n\n40:10.720 --> 40:11.560\n How do you get there?\n\n40:11.560 --> 40:14.520\n And by the way, we're talking about the 2016 Olympics\n\n40:14.520 --> 40:15.800\n where you won the silver medal.\n\n40:15.800 --> 40:18.480\n You were part of three different Olympics.\n\n40:18.480 --> 40:22.240\n But the cardio aspect of it,\n\n40:23.280 --> 40:26.660\n have you faced exhaustion often in your matches\n\n40:26.660 --> 40:29.080\n where you have to go deep and go like past?\n\n40:29.080 --> 40:32.840\n Yeah, but that's not from the judo side of it.\n\n40:32.840 --> 40:35.840\n That's from like, I did a very bad job of making weight.\n\n40:35.840 --> 40:36.960\n It's always the weight cut.\n\n40:36.960 --> 40:39.400\n Yeah, it's always the weight cut.\n\n40:39.400 --> 40:43.400\n And I think people really struggle with that.\n\n40:43.400 --> 40:46.240\n They blame cardio and training and everything else.\n\n40:46.240 --> 40:48.480\n But when it really comes down to it,\n\n40:48.480 --> 40:50.400\n like we train for an hour and a half, two hours,\n\n40:50.400 --> 40:51.880\n twice a day.\n\n40:51.880 --> 40:54.060\n How are you tired after five minutes?\n\n40:54.060 --> 40:54.900\n Right.\n\n40:54.900 --> 40:56.560\n Right, it becomes into a mental struggle,\n\n40:56.560 --> 41:01.040\n your anxiety, your stress, your lack of belief in yourself.\n\n41:01.040 --> 41:04.640\n Or in my case, sometimes it's poor nutrition.\n\n41:04.640 --> 41:06.660\n Sometimes I had one too many McDonald's meals.\n\n41:06.660 --> 41:08.720\n It just, it happens.\n\n41:08.720 --> 41:11.760\n Okay, so let's talk about weight cutting real quick.\n\n41:11.760 --> 41:16.700\n So I've seen weight cutting break\n\n41:16.700 --> 41:20.360\n some of the toughest fighters, wrestlers, grapplers ever.\n\n41:20.360 --> 41:22.000\n Like burnout break,\n\n41:22.000 --> 41:24.200\n like where it makes you wanna quit the sport.\n\n41:24.200 --> 41:27.800\n So this is what people don't often talk about,\n\n41:27.800 --> 41:29.960\n but mentally it's one of the hardest things,\n\n41:29.960 --> 41:32.800\n especially when you're doing it kind of wrong.\n\n41:32.800 --> 41:34.960\n Because it becomes a mental war.\n\n41:35.960 --> 41:37.440\n So you competed, like you said,\n\n41:37.440 --> 41:40.200\n your whole career at 81 kilograms.\n\n41:40.200 --> 41:41.600\n You walked around at?\n\n41:42.600 --> 41:44.180\n 88, 89.\n\n41:44.180 --> 41:49.180\n So about 15 pounds, sometimes 20 pounds over that.\n\n41:49.880 --> 41:51.440\n Give or take.\n\n41:51.440 --> 41:56.440\n And so what was your process like mentally and physically?\n\n41:56.720 --> 41:58.160\n First of all, maybe you can comment on\n\n41:58.160 --> 42:00.880\n when the weigh ins are relative to the matches.\n\n42:00.880 --> 42:02.680\n And then what was your process like leading\n\n42:02.680 --> 42:05.560\n like a week ahead, a day ahead,\n\n42:05.560 --> 42:09.560\n an hour ahead, minutes ahead of the weigh in?\n\n42:09.560 --> 42:13.500\n Man, everyone varies tremendously\n\n42:13.500 --> 42:16.240\n because we're not like most sports\n\n42:16.240 --> 42:18.520\n because you're dropped off in foreign countries\n\n42:18.520 --> 42:20.720\n with who knows what, right?\n\n42:20.720 --> 42:23.620\n Some places have saunas, some places have treadmills.\n\n42:24.600 --> 42:27.040\n I went to a place one time in China\n\n42:27.040 --> 42:31.220\n in the middle of winter where the roads were frozen with ice\n\n42:31.220 --> 42:32.960\n and we had to use our hotel rooms\n\n42:32.960 --> 42:35.880\n because you couldn't sweat outside\n\n42:35.880 --> 42:37.040\n because it was too cold.\n\n42:38.440 --> 42:39.920\n And every one of my Olympics,\n\n42:39.920 --> 42:42.840\n the weight cut was different just given my mass.\n\n42:42.840 --> 42:45.320\n When I went to 2008,\n\n42:45.320 --> 42:48.920\n I was probably like 82, 83 kilos walking around.\n\n42:48.920 --> 42:51.960\n So weight cutting wasn't a thing for me.\n\n42:51.960 --> 42:56.080\n In London, we actually weighed in the morning of.\n\n42:56.080 --> 42:59.080\n So weigh ins were at like 6 a.m.\n\n42:59.080 --> 43:00.920\n And the Olympics were always beneficial to me\n\n43:00.920 --> 43:04.160\n because they actually don't start until like 10 or 11.\n\n43:05.180 --> 43:07.160\n So you actually were able to recover.\n\n43:07.160 --> 43:10.020\n Where on the circuit you would weigh in at 6 a.m.\n\n43:10.020 --> 43:12.440\n and the competition started at 8 a.m.\n\n43:12.440 --> 43:15.120\n It's like, well, I was cutting weight at 5 a.m.\n\n43:15.120 --> 43:17.440\n And most of it for people who are not familiar,\n\n43:17.440 --> 43:19.280\n but maybe you can also correct me,\n\n43:19.280 --> 43:21.820\n most of it, you're really just getting the water\n\n43:21.820 --> 43:22.660\n out of your system.\n\n43:22.660 --> 43:23.480\n It was water cut.\n\n43:23.480 --> 43:25.160\n At that point, yeah.\n\n43:25.160 --> 43:27.640\n Like 24 hours before even, like.\n\n43:27.640 --> 43:28.480\n So are you?\n\n43:28.480 --> 43:29.800\n Like an hour before.\n\n43:29.800 --> 43:31.700\n But yeah, but like leading up to it.\n\n43:33.100 --> 43:36.080\n And have you eaten the day before?\n\n43:36.080 --> 43:38.520\n Do you try to minimize the amount of food in your system?\n\n43:38.520 --> 43:41.240\n My weight cutting process was a little bit different\n\n43:41.240 --> 43:46.240\n than most people because I like to eat.\n\n43:47.680 --> 43:50.960\n I'm not the type of person that believes\n\n43:50.960 --> 43:54.260\n your athletic career is determined by your nutrition.\n\n43:55.360 --> 43:56.200\n Right.\n\n43:56.200 --> 43:57.480\n I don't believe that.\n\n43:57.480 --> 43:59.840\n I think some sports are built that way.\n\n43:59.840 --> 44:01.740\n But when it comes to combat sports,\n\n44:01.740 --> 44:06.080\n like, you know, your ability to knock somebody out\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:08.440\n has nothing to do with whether you had a cheeseburger\n\n44:08.440 --> 44:09.920\n or a salad.\n\n44:09.920 --> 44:12.200\n My ability to throw you is not determined by that.\n\n44:12.200 --> 44:13.760\n I may be able to perform better\n\n44:13.760 --> 44:16.340\n because I've eaten a certain way,\n\n44:16.340 --> 44:19.980\n but not enough to justify an entire diet change.\n\n44:19.980 --> 44:22.560\n Your body is built and my body is built\n\n44:22.560 --> 44:24.040\n to operate with certain things\n\n44:24.040 --> 44:26.580\n that I've had in my system for years.\n\n44:26.580 --> 44:28.720\n Yeah, I think I'm with you,\n\n44:28.720 --> 44:32.120\n but I also believe that there's a mental aspect.\n\n44:32.120 --> 44:33.500\n So if you're surrounded by people\n\n44:33.500 --> 44:35.400\n that tell you diet matters,\n\n44:35.400 --> 44:37.180\n then if your diet is off,\n\n44:37.180 --> 44:38.840\n you're gonna believe you're going to be off\n\n44:38.840 --> 44:40.240\n because the people around you tell you\n\n44:40.240 --> 44:41.640\n your diet should be good.\n\n44:41.640 --> 44:44.400\n So yeah, I think it's like,\n\n44:44.400 --> 44:47.080\n it's the same, I've had an argument with Matthew Walker,\n\n44:47.080 --> 44:51.000\n who's a sleep scientist about sleep.\n\n44:51.000 --> 44:53.720\n And it's like, if you believe sleep is essential,\n\n44:53.720 --> 44:55.560\n it's essential to get eight hours of sleep\n\n44:55.560 --> 44:57.400\n every single night perfectly,\n\n44:57.400 --> 45:00.280\n then you're going to be very stressed when you don't get it.\n\n45:00.280 --> 45:02.520\n And then I think it will negatively affect,\n\n45:02.520 --> 45:04.480\n the stress will negatively affect your longevity\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:06.480\n and all kinds of aspects of your life.\n\n45:06.480 --> 45:09.360\n If you actually just learn to truly listen to your body,\n\n45:09.360 --> 45:12.100\n become a scientist of your own body with sleep and food,\n\n45:12.100 --> 45:15.120\n it might end up that it will be the eight hours a night\n\n45:15.120 --> 45:17.240\n or whatever, but it might be something else\n\n45:17.240 --> 45:18.800\n and probably diet error.\n\n45:18.800 --> 45:19.920\n I remember when I was meeting\n\n45:19.920 --> 45:23.640\n with the USOC nutritionist after London,\n\n45:23.640 --> 45:28.640\n it was probably around 2014, I think.\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:31.160\n And when we had our team meeting\n\n45:31.160 --> 45:33.640\n at the beginning of the year and I was talking to him,\n\n45:33.640 --> 45:35.760\n he was talking about the nutrition plans\n\n45:35.760 --> 45:37.120\n that he could put us on.\n\n45:37.120 --> 45:38.520\n And I was like, time out.\n\n45:38.520 --> 45:41.380\n I've done the USOC thing, like I've done the couscous,\n\n45:41.380 --> 45:43.400\n I've done the lemon in my water.\n\n45:43.400 --> 45:45.480\n I go, I'm full of shit.\n\n45:45.480 --> 45:46.520\n The couscous?\n\n45:46.520 --> 45:47.880\n The couscous? Yeah.\n\n45:47.880 --> 45:48.720\n Oh boy.\n\n45:48.720 --> 45:49.540\n Like there was just,\n\n45:49.540 --> 45:51.560\n cause there's like a cookie cutter plan, right?\n\n45:51.560 --> 45:54.240\n And I was like, look, here's what I want you to do.\n\n45:54.240 --> 45:56.320\n I go, I'll listen to you,\n\n45:56.320 --> 45:57.920\n but you're going to walk into the 711\n\n45:57.920 --> 45:59.940\n across the street from the USOC.\n\n45:59.940 --> 46:03.580\n And if you can't buy it in that 711, it's not on my plan.\n\n46:03.580 --> 46:04.480\n Right.\n\n46:04.480 --> 46:07.080\n I go, because I go to places where\n\n46:07.080 --> 46:10.520\n the only thing I can eat is Pringles and a Snickers bar.\n\n46:10.520 --> 46:11.360\n I've done that.\n\n46:11.360 --> 46:13.360\n Like I've flown to Azerbaijan,\n\n46:13.360 --> 46:16.320\n stayed in a hotel where the restaurant is closed.\n\n46:16.320 --> 46:18.880\n USA Judo hasn't paid for the meal plan.\n\n46:18.880 --> 46:20.500\n And the only thing that's available\n\n46:20.500 --> 46:22.040\n is the thing across the street.\n\n46:22.040 --> 46:24.440\n So you were eating Pringles.\n\n46:24.440 --> 46:25.840\n Before fighting a Grand Slam event,\n\n46:25.840 --> 46:27.200\n while cutting 20 pounds.\n\n46:27.200 --> 46:28.400\n And a Snickers bar.\n\n46:28.400 --> 46:29.780\n Yeah.\n\n46:29.780 --> 46:31.840\n I just, the visual of that, that's some like,\n\n46:31.840 --> 46:33.000\n that's some Rocky shit.\n\n46:33.000 --> 46:33.840\n Okay.\n\n46:33.840 --> 46:34.760\n Give me a nutrition plan.\n\n46:34.760 --> 46:35.600\n Go for it.\n\n46:35.600 --> 46:37.400\n Cause I'm not paying my own way\n\n46:37.400 --> 46:41.420\n to travel with 14 days of food.\n\n46:41.420 --> 46:42.320\n Right.\n\n46:42.320 --> 46:45.440\n I mean, that's, that's one of the magic of your whole career\n\n46:45.440 --> 46:46.960\n and also Judo.\n\n46:46.960 --> 46:48.980\n I mean, I'm sorry to say, of course,\n\n46:48.980 --> 46:51.240\n you want athletes to be super rich\n\n46:51.240 --> 46:53.840\n and super well funded from an athlete perspective\n\n46:53.840 --> 46:56.680\n and the sport to be popular and managed\n\n46:56.680 --> 46:57.800\n in an ultra competent way.\n\n46:57.800 --> 46:58.920\n But as a fan.\n\n46:58.920 --> 46:59.880\n That's not reality.\n\n46:59.880 --> 47:02.760\n But as a fan, it's fun to watch somebody like you\n\n47:02.760 --> 47:04.020\n who's exceptionally driven,\n\n47:04.020 --> 47:07.320\n has to suffer in all these different interesting ways.\n\n47:07.320 --> 47:12.320\n But it's only suffering if you expect the other side.\n\n47:12.320 --> 47:13.160\n Right.\n\n47:13.160 --> 47:14.320\n I don't expect it.\n\n47:14.320 --> 47:16.120\n I accept it for what it is,\n\n47:16.120 --> 47:18.680\n which is why I write off nutrition for athletes.\n\n47:18.680 --> 47:19.520\n Right.\n\n47:19.520 --> 47:20.520\n Cause it can be done without it.\n\n47:20.520 --> 47:22.800\n As long as, you know, to what you said before,\n\n47:22.800 --> 47:25.600\n like you don't believe you need it.\n\n47:25.600 --> 47:28.480\n Some people believe they need it.\n\n47:28.480 --> 47:30.180\n The mind, getting your mind right\n\n47:30.180 --> 47:31.280\n is the most important thing.\n\n47:31.280 --> 47:32.480\n You know what I believe I need?\n\n47:32.480 --> 47:33.320\n What's that?\n\n47:33.320 --> 47:35.040\n A Snickers bar when I'm tired.\n\n47:35.040 --> 47:36.080\n I want a little bit of sugar.\n\n47:36.080 --> 47:37.280\n It makes me feel better.\n\n47:38.740 --> 47:39.580\n What do you want me to do?\n\n47:39.580 --> 47:40.420\n So you,\n\n47:42.080 --> 47:43.680\n what are you going to do?\n\n47:43.680 --> 47:45.040\n Yeah.\n\n47:45.040 --> 47:47.720\n I just love the visual of you eating a Snickers bar\n\n47:47.720 --> 47:48.920\n before a grand slam.\n\n47:48.920 --> 47:51.260\n But that became part of my nutrition plan.\n\n47:51.260 --> 47:54.120\n When the USOC guy wrote my nutrition plan,\n\n47:54.120 --> 47:58.240\n I was eating a burrito bowl with brown rice,\n\n47:58.240 --> 48:02.280\n white meat chicken, black beans, guacamole, cheese,\n\n48:02.280 --> 48:05.040\n two chocolate chip cookies and a Diet Coke.\n\n48:05.040 --> 48:07.320\n This is like Chipotle or?\n\n48:07.320 --> 48:08.960\n It was Beloco, but same concept.\n\n48:08.960 --> 48:12.140\n Same concept with two chocolate chip cookies.\n\n48:12.140 --> 48:13.360\n Cause I needed the sugar.\n\n48:13.360 --> 48:14.200\n I was,\n\n48:15.300 --> 48:19.720\n I was 88 kilos when I stepped on the scale\n\n48:19.720 --> 48:22.920\n at 6.3% body fat.\n\n48:22.920 --> 48:24.080\n Now I got to make 81.\n\n48:25.240 --> 48:26.600\n Six, what?\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:27.440\n Really?\n\n48:27.440 --> 48:28.640\n Yeah.\n\n48:28.640 --> 48:30.120\n And the USOC was like,\n\n48:30.120 --> 48:34.360\n Hey, you know, you can't, you can't fight 81 anymore.\n\n48:34.360 --> 48:35.520\n You have to fight nineties.\n\n48:35.520 --> 48:38.800\n And I go, I'm already into the quad.\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:39.960\n I'm not changing.\n\n48:39.960 --> 48:42.920\n I go, build me a plan where I can do this.\n\n48:42.920 --> 48:45.480\n And now we have to have an acceptable weight cut.\n\n48:45.480 --> 48:47.480\n Like it just, what do you want me to do?\n\n48:47.480 --> 48:48.480\n I'm not the IJF.\n\n48:48.480 --> 48:51.000\n I can't just change the fact that it takes two years\n\n48:51.000 --> 48:52.580\n to qualify.\n\n48:52.580 --> 48:53.600\n I know where I'm at.\n\n48:53.600 --> 48:54.960\n I know what I have to go through\n\n48:54.960 --> 48:57.040\n and I accept the consequences.\n\n48:57.040 --> 48:57.860\n It is what it is.\n\n48:57.860 --> 48:59.180\n What do you want me to do?\n\n48:59.180 --> 49:00.880\n All right, so what was the process?\n\n49:00.880 --> 49:02.760\n I mean, can you, can you speak to,\n\n49:02.760 --> 49:05.120\n so you, you wake up early in the morning,\n\n49:05.120 --> 49:08.540\n the day of the weigh ins, a few hours before.\n\n49:08.540 --> 49:11.200\n Technically my weight cut never started\n\n49:11.200 --> 49:15.320\n until I got off a plane and to a hotel.\n\n49:15.320 --> 49:17.080\n And how many hours?\n\n49:17.080 --> 49:18.000\n Three days.\n\n49:19.180 --> 49:20.680\n So it's a three day cut.\n\n49:20.680 --> 49:21.520\n It's a three day cut.\n\n49:21.520 --> 49:23.120\n Mentally you're thinking of it that way.\n\n49:23.120 --> 49:23.960\n Yep.\n\n49:23.960 --> 49:24.980\n And then you're still eating.\n\n49:24.980 --> 49:26.080\n I eat every day.\n\n49:26.080 --> 49:28.480\n And then like, what do you load up on water?\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:32.320\n Maybe as you start and then the water stops.\n\n49:32.320 --> 49:33.320\n It is what it is.\n\n49:35.320 --> 49:38.440\n So you, I mean, it's a slow,\n\n49:38.440 --> 49:41.600\n you're not actually like sweating all three days.\n\n49:41.600 --> 49:42.960\n Yeah.\n\n49:42.960 --> 49:44.880\n But then it's like torture to sleep.\n\n49:46.560 --> 49:47.560\n Part of the process.\n\n49:49.100 --> 49:50.360\n Are you able to sleep?\n\n49:50.360 --> 49:51.200\n Sometimes.\n\n49:52.320 --> 49:53.200\n It depends.\n\n49:54.280 --> 49:57.140\n So you're dehydrated, further and further dehydrated\n\n49:57.140 --> 50:01.040\n with six, 7% body fat, trying to lose 10 pounds.\n\n50:01.040 --> 50:03.920\n I even developed a way to drink water out of a bottle\n\n50:03.920 --> 50:04.880\n where I don't drink anything,\n\n50:04.880 --> 50:08.040\n but I feel like I have swishing it.\n\n50:08.040 --> 50:08.880\n What's the, no.\n\n50:08.880 --> 50:10.640\n So like, I take like a bottle of water\n\n50:10.640 --> 50:13.520\n and like, if we were to like, to draw a line on it,\n\n50:13.520 --> 50:15.120\n I would tip it and I would go like this.\n\n50:15.120 --> 50:15.960\n I would go.\n\n50:23.440 --> 50:24.480\n And you would draw that line,\n\n50:24.480 --> 50:27.280\n but like I've drank now water for 20 seconds or whatever\n\n50:27.280 --> 50:28.120\n it is.\n\n50:29.160 --> 50:32.000\n And I feel, I get the fix.\n\n50:32.000 --> 50:33.320\n Brain told me I got there.\n\n50:34.360 --> 50:35.820\n No problem.\n\n50:35.820 --> 50:36.920\n That's amazing, man.\n\n50:36.920 --> 50:39.980\n You just, your mind's a very powerful tool.\n\n50:39.980 --> 50:44.440\n And the problem a lot of people have is\n\n50:45.960 --> 50:48.340\n they don't accept the reality of the situation.\n\n50:49.200 --> 50:51.600\n They bitch about the reality of the situation.\n\n50:51.600 --> 50:52.440\n I just.\n\n50:52.440 --> 50:56.880\n First of all, you could always quit, right?\n\n50:56.880 --> 50:57.720\n Yep.\n\n50:57.720 --> 50:59.000\n So like, you're not.\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.240\n Never missed weight.\n\n51:00.240 --> 51:01.080\n Never.\n\n51:01.080 --> 51:01.920\n Never missed weight.\n\n51:01.920 --> 51:04.120\n You can perform poorly.\n\n51:04.120 --> 51:04.960\n You can't miss weight.\n\n51:04.960 --> 51:05.800\n Don't miss weight.\n\n51:05.800 --> 51:07.000\n Don't miss weight.\n\n51:07.000 --> 51:10.160\n Because you can always win\n\n51:10.160 --> 51:12.600\n regardless of how bad the weight cut is.\n\n51:12.600 --> 51:14.640\n You can never win if you miss weight.\n\n51:15.800 --> 51:19.200\n But your brain is also really good.\n\n51:19.200 --> 51:20.620\n Maybe not your brain,\n\n51:20.620 --> 51:23.480\n but I know my brain,\n\n51:23.480 --> 51:26.080\n I think most people's brains are good at generating,\n\n51:26.080 --> 51:27.680\n the more desperate things become,\n\n51:27.680 --> 51:30.560\n the better at generating excuses.\n\n51:30.560 --> 51:32.800\n So what were you doing with your mind\n\n51:33.760 --> 51:37.560\n that resulted in you never missing weight?\n\n51:37.560 --> 51:39.040\n The plan.\n\n51:39.040 --> 51:43.540\n So like I said, like my weight cut would never start\n\n51:43.540 --> 51:45.480\n until I got to the hotel\n\n51:45.480 --> 51:48.680\n because I didn't check my weight the morning of,\n\n51:48.680 --> 51:50.760\n I didn't check my weight when I got there.\n\n51:50.760 --> 51:52.840\n I just, while I'm traveling,\n\n51:52.840 --> 51:55.880\n I'm doing things at like a minimal level,\n\n51:55.880 --> 51:58.780\n but I'm never not giving myself something I'm craving.\n\n52:01.880 --> 52:04.760\n If I'm thirsty, I'm drinking a Diet Coke.\n\n52:04.760 --> 52:07.760\n If I'm hungry, I'm buying a Snickers bar.\n\n52:07.760 --> 52:09.040\n I'm buying a sandwich.\n\n52:09.960 --> 52:10.800\n I am.\n\n52:11.680 --> 52:14.160\n And I accept the consequences when I get there.\n\n52:14.160 --> 52:16.040\n And then when I get there,\n\n52:16.040 --> 52:19.000\n if I step on the scale and it says 88 kilos,\n\n52:19.000 --> 52:21.200\n I instantaneously know exactly\n\n52:21.200 --> 52:22.920\n what it's gonna take to be 81.\n\n52:22.920 --> 52:24.800\n And then you just follow like a robot,\n\n52:24.800 --> 52:26.360\n follow a very specific process.\n\n52:26.360 --> 52:27.960\n Yep.\n\n52:27.960 --> 52:28.880\n And then, I mean,\n\n52:28.880 --> 52:31.720\n cause there's a lot of seconds in three days,\n\n52:31.720 --> 52:33.720\n seconds and minutes and you just.\n\n52:33.720 --> 52:36.480\n I just know exactly what it takes from my body.\n\n52:36.480 --> 52:39.720\n I know exactly what a one hour gym workout\n\n52:39.720 --> 52:43.040\n wearing a sauna suit is gonna take.\n\n52:43.040 --> 52:45.520\n I know exactly what I'm gonna lose on day one.\n\n52:45.520 --> 52:47.960\n And I know exactly what I'm gonna lose on day three,\n\n52:47.960 --> 52:49.480\n because they're not the same.\n\n52:49.480 --> 52:52.240\n So I can instantly look at a hotel,\n\n52:52.240 --> 52:55.700\n decide is there a bathroom, sauna, gym,\n\n52:55.700 --> 52:59.840\n temperature of the gym, access to the gym and when it is,\n\n52:59.840 --> 53:03.020\n access to the judo mats, my training partners,\n\n53:03.020 --> 53:06.360\n the roads versus streetlights, the weather outside.\n\n53:06.360 --> 53:08.460\n I can take a look at that environment and say,\n\n53:08.460 --> 53:11.040\n this is my weight, this is weigh ins.\n\n53:11.040 --> 53:12.720\n And instantaneously in my head,\n\n53:12.720 --> 53:14.220\n there's a plan to make weight.\n\n53:14.220 --> 53:18.840\n And you have a sense of how much sweat adds up to 10 pounds.\n\n53:18.840 --> 53:20.560\n How much sweat plus time.\n\n53:20.560 --> 53:21.400\n Yeah.\n\n53:21.400 --> 53:24.040\n And I make sure in my plan,\n\n53:24.040 --> 53:27.360\n all of my meals and how much water I need in between\n\n53:27.360 --> 53:29.160\n is allocated to still make weight.\n\n53:29.160 --> 53:31.880\n Cause you have to eat or drink during that time.\n\n53:31.880 --> 53:36.680\n Are you incorporating like mental exhaustion into this?\n\n53:36.680 --> 53:38.140\n That doesn't exist.\n\n53:38.140 --> 53:38.980\n So it doesn't?\n\n53:38.980 --> 53:39.800\n No, it doesn't.\n\n53:39.800 --> 53:41.120\n Do you like meditate or something?\n\n53:41.120 --> 53:43.560\n What did the thoughts come, especially three days.\n\n53:43.560 --> 53:45.840\n We're not talking about four hours of suffering.\n\n53:45.840 --> 53:46.680\n I'll tell you.\n\n53:46.680 --> 53:48.960\n This has broken some of the toughest people in the world.\n\n53:48.960 --> 53:51.520\n The hardest weight cut I ever had.\n\n53:51.520 --> 53:52.600\n Hardest one.\n\n53:53.680 --> 53:58.680\n I fought Pan Am games in 2015 in Edmonton, Canada\n\n53:58.840 --> 54:03.020\n on a Wednesday and I won.\n\n54:03.020 --> 54:06.600\n So I've made weight on Tuesday.\n\n54:06.600 --> 54:08.700\n I fought on Wednesday where I had to weigh in\n\n54:08.700 --> 54:12.000\n 5% of my weight class, so 84 kilos.\n\n54:12.000 --> 54:14.000\n On Wednesday I was 84 kilos.\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:19.000\n I got on a plane on that Wednesday night\n\n54:19.400 --> 54:23.260\n and landed Friday morning in Sochi.\n\n54:24.360 --> 54:26.120\n Okay, so I've traveled now.\n\n54:27.680 --> 54:32.280\n I got on the scale, all my bags got lost, everything.\n\n54:32.280 --> 54:36.880\n So somehow I flew from there to here, no bags.\n\n54:36.880 --> 54:40.640\n And I threw all of my stuff in my bag.\n\n54:40.640 --> 54:44.760\n I wore sandals, one pair of pants and a T shirt\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:47.240\n on the plane because I was like, I'm just tired.\n\n54:47.240 --> 54:48.080\n I just fought.\n\n54:48.080 --> 54:49.480\n I don't even want to carry it.\n\n54:49.480 --> 54:50.440\n I don't care.\n\n54:50.440 --> 54:52.880\n What are the odds that I get there and my bags are gone?\n\n54:52.880 --> 54:54.360\n Yeah, very low.\n\n54:54.360 --> 54:55.920\n Very low.\n\n54:55.920 --> 54:57.680\n Sure enough, it's gone.\n\n54:57.680 --> 54:58.960\n I get all the way to Sochi.\n\n54:58.960 --> 55:00.560\n I check into the hotel.\n\n55:00.560 --> 55:01.580\n There's one sauna.\n\n55:02.800 --> 55:03.640\n Guess what?\n\n55:03.640 --> 55:06.480\n You have to reserve it and you're only allowed\n\n55:06.480 --> 55:08.520\n to reserve it for an X period of time.\n\n55:08.520 --> 55:11.200\n Guess in a small tangent, when you phoned out,\n\n55:11.200 --> 55:13.040\n your bags are gone.\n\n55:13.040 --> 55:15.200\n This is something I'll often think about.\n\n55:15.200 --> 55:17.120\n There's like people that are helping you, right?\n\n55:17.120 --> 55:20.320\n Like there's a person at the airport who goes.\n\n55:20.320 --> 55:21.160\n Yep, oops.\n\n55:21.160 --> 55:21.980\n Just like that.\n\n55:21.980 --> 55:24.120\n And then the person at the hotel who tells you\n\n55:24.120 --> 55:27.280\n that you have to reserve the sauna and looks at you like\n\n55:27.280 --> 55:30.800\n you're, they don't care that you've been suffering.\n\n55:30.800 --> 55:33.720\n They don't even understand why you need it.\n\n55:33.720 --> 55:34.840\n Yeah, like why?\n\n55:34.840 --> 55:38.840\n Oh, you know, oh, this, like this little kid reserved it\n\n55:38.840 --> 55:41.520\n for five hours or something to block it off.\n\n55:41.520 --> 55:42.360\n I'm sorry.\n\n55:43.280 --> 55:45.080\n Is there a frustration that gets in there?\n\n55:45.080 --> 55:45.920\n Are you?\n\n55:45.920 --> 55:46.880\n You just accept reality.\n\n55:46.880 --> 55:50.600\n Don't even hinder on like the things you can't change.\n\n55:50.600 --> 55:52.280\n Because the second you get frustrated,\n\n55:52.280 --> 55:55.760\n the second you think you can change it,\n\n55:55.760 --> 55:56.700\n you'll harp on it.\n\n55:56.700 --> 55:58.240\n And that breaks most men.\n\n55:58.240 --> 55:59.140\n Yeah.\n\n55:59.140 --> 56:02.460\n That like little thing in the back of their mind thinking,\n\n56:02.460 --> 56:03.880\n oh, like what if?\n\n56:03.880 --> 56:04.700\n There's no what if.\n\n56:04.700 --> 56:06.800\n There's only right here right now.\n\n56:06.800 --> 56:07.880\n If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.\n\n56:07.880 --> 56:10.080\n Let's just quickly come up with a solution\n\n56:10.080 --> 56:11.000\n to fix the problem.\n\n56:11.000 --> 56:13.360\n By the way, as another small tangent,\n\n56:13.360 --> 56:16.280\n all the greatest people I've interacted with\n\n56:16.280 --> 56:19.260\n at the highest level think like that.\n\n56:19.260 --> 56:22.440\n They don't linger on the, it's like the next thing.\n\n56:22.440 --> 56:23.280\n Yeah.\n\n56:23.280 --> 56:25.360\n Because like, if you want to do something great,\n\n56:25.360 --> 56:28.240\n hard stuff is going to keep happening to you.\n\n56:28.240 --> 56:30.420\n And if you're going to let that affect you,\n\n56:30.420 --> 56:32.400\n you're not ever going to do the great thing.\n\n56:32.400 --> 56:33.640\n It's fascinating actually.\n\n56:33.640 --> 56:36.480\n Like that's the one skill you have to learn.\n\n56:36.480 --> 56:38.000\n Elon Musk is great at this.\n\n56:38.000 --> 56:39.780\n Constantly dealing with emergencies.\n\n56:39.780 --> 56:40.620\n Okay.\n\n56:40.620 --> 56:41.440\n Okay, this happened.\n\n56:41.440 --> 56:42.280\n What's the next step?\n\n56:42.280 --> 56:43.200\n Yep.\n\n56:43.200 --> 56:44.040\n Accept.\n\n56:44.040 --> 56:44.860\n It's not that big of a deal.\n\n56:44.860 --> 56:46.040\n Every problem has a solution.\n\n56:46.040 --> 56:47.000\n Yeah.\n\n56:47.000 --> 56:47.840\n Yeah.\n\n56:47.840 --> 56:50.680\n And if I can't solve it, it's not my problem.\n\n56:50.680 --> 56:51.520\n You know what I mean?\n\n56:51.520 --> 56:52.340\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n56:52.340 --> 56:54.320\n So what, so how'd you figure it out?\n\n56:54.320 --> 56:55.160\n In sandals?\n\n56:55.160 --> 56:57.320\n Get this, I get to the hotel.\n\n56:57.320 --> 56:58.160\n Yeah.\n\n56:58.160 --> 56:58.980\n I check in.\n\n56:58.980 --> 57:00.700\n I don't even know about the sauna yet.\n\n57:00.700 --> 57:03.240\n I go, I need to find a clothing store.\n\n57:03.240 --> 57:05.280\n I'm in the middle of Russia.\n\n57:05.280 --> 57:08.280\n I open up Google Maps and I'm like, sports store.\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:11.440\n I find an Adidas sports store\n\n57:11.440 --> 57:14.360\n in the middle of Sochi, Russia, right?\n\n57:14.360 --> 57:18.180\n I spend like $500 on like average sweats.\n\n57:18.180 --> 57:21.960\n No plastics, no nothing, and no running shoes\n\n57:21.960 --> 57:22.880\n cause they don't have any.\n\n57:22.880 --> 57:24.400\n What's the temperature outside?\n\n57:24.400 --> 57:25.320\n Is it cold?\n\n57:25.320 --> 57:27.000\n It was kind of like springish.\n\n57:27.000 --> 57:29.200\n So it wasn't cold, but it wasn't hot.\n\n57:29.200 --> 57:30.040\n Yeah.\n\n57:30.040 --> 57:32.640\n So you still need a lot of layers preferably.\n\n57:32.640 --> 57:34.600\n You would need a lot of layers just to cut\n\n57:34.600 --> 57:36.760\n the amount of weight I'm about to tell you I have to cut\n\n57:36.760 --> 57:40.120\n because after I bought that stuff that next morning,\n\n57:40.120 --> 57:42.800\n and mind you, it's a Friday, it's a Friday morning.\n\n57:42.800 --> 57:47.520\n I go to the venue where we have the mats open to train\n\n57:47.520 --> 57:49.440\n and I step on the scale.\n\n57:49.440 --> 57:52.480\n And then Sagan Batar of Mongolia goes,\n\n57:52.480 --> 57:54.940\n oh, pretty good, you're almost there.\n\n57:54.940 --> 57:59.180\n And I go, no, I'm not.\n\n57:59.180 --> 58:01.540\n I stepped on the scale at almost 94 kilos.\n\n58:01.540 --> 58:05.740\n And I looked at him and I was like, I'm 81.\n\n58:05.740 --> 58:07.740\n And he went, good luck.\n\n58:09.540 --> 58:10.760\n You're almost there.\n\n58:11.780 --> 58:12.620\n Yeah.\n\n58:13.880 --> 58:15.740\n For the next weight class above.\n\n58:16.580 --> 58:18.540\n Is this on a Saturday or Sunday?\n\n58:18.540 --> 58:19.380\n Friday morning.\n\n58:19.380 --> 58:20.220\n No, no, no, sorry.\n\n58:20.220 --> 58:22.720\n Friday morning, the competition is when?\n\n58:22.720 --> 58:23.560\n Sunday.\n\n58:23.560 --> 58:24.380\n Sunday.\n\n58:24.380 --> 58:25.700\n I weigh in Sunday.\n\n58:25.700 --> 58:26.540\n Okay.\n\n58:27.420 --> 58:28.980\n I'm like, holy crap.\n\n58:28.980 --> 58:32.700\n I throw on all my layers and there's one other person\n\n58:32.700 --> 58:35.100\n with me there, Kalita, who was my girlfriend at the time,\n\n58:35.100 --> 58:38.020\n now my wife, we start doing judo.\n\n58:38.020 --> 58:40.780\n Cause I'm like, this will be the easiest way to knock off\n\n58:40.780 --> 58:42.940\n like three or four kilos.\n\n58:42.940 --> 58:44.180\n Well, it's cold.\n\n58:44.180 --> 58:48.660\n I have no gi and I'm working out with a female.\n\n58:48.660 --> 58:52.760\n I can't get overly physical to really get my muscles\n\n58:52.760 --> 58:54.260\n going to really break that sweat\n\n58:54.260 --> 58:56.660\n because she has to compete in a day or two.\n\n58:56.660 --> 58:58.180\n She's not a training partner.\n\n58:58.180 --> 59:00.900\n You can't just use this person.\n\n59:00.900 --> 59:02.140\n I stepped on the scale.\n\n59:02.140 --> 59:03.320\n I was 91 kilos.\n\n59:04.280 --> 59:06.780\n So I went, well, I was a nice den, but like,\n\n59:06.780 --> 59:09.640\n yeah, I go, that's not going to fly.\n\n59:09.640 --> 59:13.020\n So sure enough, the clothes are now ruined.\n\n59:13.020 --> 59:15.980\n They didn't help me lose any extra weight.\n\n59:15.980 --> 59:19.740\n So I go back to the hotel and I start reserving the sauna.\n\n59:19.740 --> 59:21.540\n Do you know how hard it is to lose that much weight\n\n59:21.540 --> 59:24.140\n in a sauna by yourself?\n\n59:24.140 --> 59:25.720\n So it's harder on many levels,\n\n59:25.720 --> 59:27.260\n but one of them is just mental.\n\n59:27.260 --> 59:28.340\n Yeah.\n\n59:28.340 --> 59:29.900\n You're sitting in heat.\n\n59:29.900 --> 59:32.340\n Heat, and you're not doing anything.\n\n59:32.340 --> 59:34.860\n Like if there had been a bike or like the sauna\n\n59:34.860 --> 59:36.560\n was big enough to use a jump rope\n\n59:36.560 --> 59:39.860\n or you could do some sort of activity,\n\n59:39.860 --> 59:44.340\n but you just sit and you stew and you're there mentally.\n\n59:44.340 --> 59:46.860\n At one point during the weight cut,\n\n59:46.860 --> 59:49.900\n I actually had my mouth on the bottom part of the door\n\n59:49.900 --> 59:53.900\n where there was a little gap and my legs up on the benches\n\n59:53.900 --> 59:56.900\n and Kalita holding the door so that it didn't open\n\n59:56.900 --> 59:59.260\n so I couldn't open it so that I could lean against\n\n59:59.260 --> 1:00:01.340\n that thing and have fresh air.\n\n1:00:01.340 --> 1:00:03.540\n Cause I was like, I was struggling.\n\n1:00:04.880 --> 1:00:07.580\n And we're talking about, I mean, how many hours is that?\n\n1:00:07.580 --> 1:00:08.420\n Hours.\n\n1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:09.260\n And then the thing is,\n\n1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:11.360\n is because you have to reserve the sauna.\n\n1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:13.320\n I can't even take like a 30 minute break\n\n1:00:13.320 --> 1:00:16.140\n because the sauna is not going to be mine in an hour,\n\n1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:19.180\n which means you have to use the sauna and the heat\n\n1:00:19.180 --> 1:00:21.180\n for that allotted time period.\n\n1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:23.260\n And I hate saunas.\n\n1:00:23.260 --> 1:00:25.540\n That is always my last resort.\n\n1:00:25.540 --> 1:00:26.620\n I would use a bath.\n\n1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:27.500\n I will train.\n\n1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:28.340\n I will run.\n\n1:00:28.340 --> 1:00:29.660\n I will jump rope.\n\n1:00:29.660 --> 1:00:32.740\n Sauna is like, oh, let me do that for 10 minutes\n\n1:00:32.740 --> 1:00:34.860\n after all of my gym workouts,\n\n1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:37.820\n just to keep the sweat going while I stretch and cool down.\n\n1:00:37.820 --> 1:00:39.420\n That's never like the, hey,\n\n1:00:39.420 --> 1:00:41.200\n I'm going to do five, 10 minute sessions\n\n1:00:41.200 --> 1:00:43.420\n because I need to lose two kilos.\n\n1:00:43.420 --> 1:00:44.820\n That is never the plan.\n\n1:00:44.820 --> 1:00:45.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:46.940 --> 1:00:50.980\n But I mean, so I've done plenty of sauna for weight cuts\n\n1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:54.020\n to know I can't even imagine what you went through.\n\n1:00:54.020 --> 1:00:54.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:56.900\n And the seconds slow down.\n\n1:00:56.900 --> 1:00:59.540\n That's one way to achieve immortality is like\n\n1:00:59.540 --> 1:01:02.020\n the time slows down to like a stop\n\n1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:04.460\n and you're left alone with your thoughts.\n\n1:01:04.460 --> 1:01:05.300\n You can't do anything.\n\n1:01:05.300 --> 1:01:06.420\n Just like you said, you can't.\n\n1:01:06.420 --> 1:01:09.080\n There's nothing worse than sitting in that kind of heat\n\n1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:11.140\n for 10, 15 minutes.\n\n1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:11.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:11.980 --> 1:01:15.180\n And then you walk out and you're not even sweating.\n\n1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:16.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:17.060\n There's nothing worse than that.\n\n1:01:17.060 --> 1:01:19.380\n And if you like, and maybe if you weigh yourself,\n\n1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:20.780\n which you probably shouldn't be doing\n\n1:01:20.780 --> 1:01:21.700\n because it'll break you.\n\n1:01:21.700 --> 1:01:22.540\n Yep.\n\n1:01:22.540 --> 1:01:23.420\n You haven't lost anything.\n\n1:01:23.420 --> 1:01:25.100\n Yep.\n\n1:01:25.100 --> 1:01:26.820\n And I was weighing myself every time\n\n1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:28.760\n because I only get breaks\n\n1:01:28.760 --> 1:01:31.340\n when I was hitting weight allotments.\n\n1:01:31.340 --> 1:01:34.220\n And so if I could lose 0.3 in 10 minutes,\n\n1:01:34.220 --> 1:01:37.580\n I'd give myself a break, but I had to hit certain numbers\n\n1:01:37.580 --> 1:01:40.260\n because I only have the sauna for a certain amount of time.\n\n1:01:40.260 --> 1:01:42.500\n And I remember one time I went downstairs\n\n1:01:42.500 --> 1:01:44.180\n to get my key to the sauna\n\n1:01:44.180 --> 1:01:46.980\n and the Japanese team had reserved it and took it from me\n\n1:01:47.860 --> 1:01:49.300\n because the guy didn't put my name on the list\n\n1:01:49.300 --> 1:01:51.040\n when I called down to get the sauna.\n\n1:01:51.040 --> 1:01:54.060\n So I lost an entire session that I had to get made up\n\n1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:55.500\n towards the later part of the day\n\n1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:57.860\n because I still have no running shoes.\n\n1:01:57.860 --> 1:02:01.340\n And then sure enough, my bags show up 30 minutes\n\n1:02:01.340 --> 1:02:02.240\n after weigh ins.\n\n1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:04.940\n Great.\n\n1:02:04.940 --> 1:02:07.380\n That's like the universe just kind of giving you\n\n1:02:07.380 --> 1:02:08.580\n a little wink there.\n\n1:02:08.580 --> 1:02:09.420\n Yep.\n\n1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:15.060\n I think like, because so few people do this weight cut\n\n1:02:15.060 --> 1:02:18.340\n at this high of a level, people don't often realize\n\n1:02:18.340 --> 1:02:20.020\n because people get a sense of how hard it is\n\n1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:22.580\n to run 200 miles in the desert.\n\n1:02:22.580 --> 1:02:25.580\n Like they, cause they go outside here in Texas,\n\n1:02:25.580 --> 1:02:26.580\n you can run five miles.\n\n1:02:26.580 --> 1:02:27.620\n Oh, it's hard.\n\n1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:30.500\n But like the weight cut is really,\n\n1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:34.960\n I, can you, so you just, like, how did you do it?\n\n1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:37.920\n Just fucking not refusing to.\n\n1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:38.940\n You have to make weight.\n\n1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:41.340\n You have to make weight and you just, that's.\n\n1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:50.340\n I am astounded when I hear like UFC fighters like miss weight.\n\n1:02:50.340 --> 1:02:51.620\n Right?\n\n1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:56.220\n Like when Jaden Cox missed weight at the Olympic trials,\n\n1:02:56.220 --> 1:02:59.940\n I was like, at least his was understandable\n\n1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:03.020\n because he missed the actual weigh ins.\n\n1:03:03.020 --> 1:03:05.820\n He didn't, he wasn't like not on weight.\n\n1:03:05.820 --> 1:03:08.660\n But when UFC fighters like miss weight,\n\n1:03:08.660 --> 1:03:12.340\n I'm like, how did that happen?\n\n1:03:12.340 --> 1:03:15.480\n You clearly like gave up a long time ago.\n\n1:03:16.540 --> 1:03:19.940\n There were times where I was like, well, I can't do this.\n\n1:03:19.940 --> 1:03:23.780\n There've been times where I've been in a sauna suit\n\n1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:27.240\n wrestling with a training partner who's probably 60 kilos\n\n1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:31.340\n who fought earlier that day to lose point three.\n\n1:03:31.340 --> 1:03:32.980\n Did lose point three.\n\n1:03:32.980 --> 1:03:35.800\n Like, are you considering your mortality in this moment?\n\n1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:39.420\n Like, aren't you thinking you're going to die?\n\n1:03:39.420 --> 1:03:41.340\n Because like, it's severe dehydration.\n\n1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:44.220\n You could damage your body.\n\n1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:51.780\n Are you thinking about any of this or is it just, man.\n\n1:03:51.780 --> 1:03:52.580\n OK, yes.\n\n1:03:52.580 --> 1:03:55.500\n But see, I'm on the other level too where like,\n\n1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:57.100\n I've been in Belgium, right?\n\n1:03:57.100 --> 1:03:59.860\n Belgium, there used to be a B level tournament.\n\n1:03:59.860 --> 1:04:01.860\n And the tournament used to go on.\n\n1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:03.900\n And because I was always on the heavier side,\n\n1:04:03.900 --> 1:04:08.140\n like 81s fights on the second day, which is the heavyweight day,\n\n1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:10.260\n weigh ins were always at like, let's say,\n\n1:04:10.260 --> 1:04:12.540\n 2 p.m. the day before for that tournament.\n\n1:04:12.540 --> 1:04:15.100\n Well, there was a sauna at the tournament.\n\n1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:22.820\n I remember like being in the sauna and like, oh, I'm 80.9 kilos.\n\n1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:24.100\n Weigh ins aren't for three hours.\n\n1:04:24.100 --> 1:04:25.700\n Fuck it, I'm going to have lunch.\n\n1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:33.700\n Because I mentally understand that what I eat right now\n\n1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:35.900\n is going to fuel me for tomorrow.\n\n1:04:35.900 --> 1:04:37.500\n So I don't want to skip it.\n\n1:04:37.500 --> 1:04:41.740\n I have the time to put it into my system and still lose it.\n\n1:04:41.740 --> 1:04:43.180\n It's almost like a computer program.\n\n1:04:43.180 --> 1:04:46.100\n You're running through the process.\n\n1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:50.340\n I get it, but like that all relies on your ability to be.\n\n1:04:50.340 --> 1:04:51.460\n To get it back off.\n\n1:04:51.460 --> 1:04:53.900\n Yeah, I mean, but also just like go through this process,\n\n1:04:53.900 --> 1:04:54.700\n which is painful.\n\n1:04:54.700 --> 1:04:57.020\n It's like those monks who meditate while sitting in a fire\n\n1:04:57.020 --> 1:05:00.660\n kind of thing or something, right?\n\n1:05:00.660 --> 1:05:02.500\n Yeah, it's really interesting.\n\n1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:05.580\n Is there other people that are critical to this\n\n1:05:05.580 --> 1:05:07.460\n or is this all internal to you?\n\n1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:09.820\n Are there people that?\n\n1:05:09.820 --> 1:05:14.180\n Everybody has their own way of doing it.\n\n1:05:14.180 --> 1:05:15.980\n Some people don't cut that much.\n\n1:05:15.980 --> 1:05:18.300\n Some people can't weight cut at all, right?\n\n1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:22.580\n They would rather have been like 83 kilos fighting 90\n\n1:05:22.580 --> 1:05:28.980\n than, you know, be 83 kilos fighting 81.\n\n1:05:28.980 --> 1:05:32.540\n So why did you never move up to 90?\n\n1:05:32.540 --> 1:05:33.780\n What's your sense?\n\n1:05:33.780 --> 1:05:36.460\n Is it from your deep understanding of your own judo\n\n1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:40.540\n and like the judo opponents you would face at 90 and 81?\n\n1:05:40.540 --> 1:05:42.980\n Cause 81 is probably the hardest,\n\n1:05:42.980 --> 1:05:45.820\n if not the second hardest division in the history of judo\n\n1:05:45.820 --> 1:05:49.100\n compared to 73 and 81.\n\n1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:52.740\n You know, when I was a kid, like I always wanted to be\n\n1:05:52.740 --> 1:05:54.660\n like the middleweight Olympic champion,\n\n1:05:54.660 --> 1:05:57.300\n like the 81 kilo Olympic champion.\n\n1:05:57.300 --> 1:06:00.140\n When I was in high school, I made a decision\n\n1:06:00.140 --> 1:06:01.940\n when I was trying to make weight for 73,\n\n1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:05.860\n I was like, I was cutting weight for 73\n\n1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:09.020\n like I was cutting weight at the end of my career, right?\n\n1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:11.580\n And I was like, I'm just gonna bag it.\n\n1:06:11.580 --> 1:06:12.660\n I'm gonna accept the fact\n\n1:06:12.660 --> 1:06:14.260\n that I may not make a junior world team,\n\n1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:18.020\n I may not make this team, but I'll grow into the division\n\n1:06:18.020 --> 1:06:20.500\n so when I'm a senior player, like I'm ready to go\n\n1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:22.700\n and I'll naturally be stronger.\n\n1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:25.020\n There's an understanding of like a growth process\n\n1:06:25.020 --> 1:06:27.180\n when you move up a weight class.\n\n1:06:27.180 --> 1:06:31.540\n Most people can't just, oh, I'm gonna fight 90s\n\n1:06:31.540 --> 1:06:33.860\n and I'm gonna win because I wanted 81.\n\n1:06:33.860 --> 1:06:37.260\n The style of judo is different, how you move is different,\n\n1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:38.700\n how they do things is different.\n\n1:06:38.700 --> 1:06:41.100\n There's like a learning curve that goes into it.\n\n1:06:41.980 --> 1:06:45.180\n And because the weight cut didn't really happen\n\n1:06:45.180 --> 1:06:47.500\n until I was getting ready for Rio,\n\n1:06:47.500 --> 1:06:49.860\n I wasn't about to have my last Olympic games\n\n1:06:49.860 --> 1:06:51.020\n be at a different weight class\n\n1:06:51.020 --> 1:06:53.820\n that I may or may not be able to grow into.\n\n1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:57.860\n I mean, this is an awesome story of you kind of decided\n\n1:06:57.860 --> 1:06:59.820\n that this will be your life's work\n\n1:06:59.820 --> 1:07:03.540\n in terms of judo competitor is like the 81 division.\n\n1:07:03.540 --> 1:07:05.700\n I'm going to, I mean, I don't know if you saw it that way,\n\n1:07:05.700 --> 1:07:07.660\n but you're talking about three Olympics\n\n1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:12.660\n and it's like this story of, I would say tragedy and triumph\n\n1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:18.540\n of just wars and 81 kilograms with the usual cast\n\n1:07:18.660 --> 1:07:21.980\n of characters of the top five in the world kind of thing.\n\n1:07:21.980 --> 1:07:24.540\n So you just became a scholar of that,\n\n1:07:24.540 --> 1:07:28.020\n let your body grow into it and then let your body outgrow it\n\n1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:31.700\n and still suffer through it to keep it in the 81 kilograms.\n\n1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:34.940\n You never competed at like at the highest levels at 90.\n\n1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:37.980\n I entered one tournament at 90 kilos.\n\n1:07:37.980 --> 1:07:42.980\n And that was because before Rio from the end of 2014,\n\n1:07:46.980 --> 1:07:49.700\n all the way up until Rio's, every time I fought,\n\n1:07:49.700 --> 1:07:54.580\n I got hurt every time there was no time where I made weight\n\n1:07:54.580 --> 1:07:57.300\n and got injured because my body weight was so high.\n\n1:07:57.300 --> 1:08:01.220\n My body fat was so low that by the time I dehydrated enough\n\n1:08:01.220 --> 1:08:04.420\n to get down there and you take the physicality of judo\n\n1:08:04.420 --> 1:08:08.020\n and throw that into the mix, something broke every time.\n\n1:08:08.020 --> 1:08:10.140\n It was like nature of the beast.\n\n1:08:11.260 --> 1:08:15.820\n So the plan was before Rio,\n\n1:08:17.020 --> 1:08:19.060\n we made an agreement with USA judo\n\n1:08:19.060 --> 1:08:21.980\n that Travis, you're gonna fight 90 kilos,\n\n1:08:21.980 --> 1:08:23.740\n but you're not gonna weigh in at 90 kilos.\n\n1:08:23.740 --> 1:08:27.100\n Like, hey, there's no like, you get to be 94 kilos\n\n1:08:27.100 --> 1:08:29.260\n and cut to 90s, there's like a,\n\n1:08:29.260 --> 1:08:31.960\n you're gonna step on the scale at 84 kilos,\n\n1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:34.920\n like a little bit of a weight cut, but not a full one,\n\n1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:38.180\n just so that you feel like you get into like the tournament.\n\n1:08:38.180 --> 1:08:41.380\n Because when I, around 2012,\n\n1:08:41.380 --> 1:08:44.500\n when I was talking with the USOC nutritionist,\n\n1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:46.180\n I actually got my weight down so much\n\n1:08:46.180 --> 1:08:48.320\n that I didn't really need to cut weight.\n\n1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:49.760\n The problem is, is I wasn't cutting weight,\n\n1:08:49.760 --> 1:08:51.420\n I didn't feel like I was competing.\n\n1:08:51.420 --> 1:08:52.260\n Got it.\n\n1:08:52.260 --> 1:08:55.140\n Right, you have to go through like that mental process.\n\n1:08:55.140 --> 1:08:56.580\n And I never really reworked that,\n\n1:08:56.580 --> 1:08:59.380\n it was easier to just cut the weight and be ready to go.\n\n1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:02.960\n But when I entered into the 90 kilo division,\n\n1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:05.180\n I was rushed to the hospital the night after\n\n1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:09.500\n because my body broke out in hives, like full body.\n\n1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:11.980\n They said it was stress induced.\n\n1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:14.460\n Fascinating.\n\n1:09:14.460 --> 1:09:18.380\n So a month before the games, I was hospitalized and hungry\n\n1:09:18.380 --> 1:09:21.820\n and filled with steroids to get the hives to drop.\n\n1:09:21.820 --> 1:09:25.620\n And every couple days, my body, when I got back home,\n\n1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:27.300\n I would end up in the hospital\n\n1:09:27.300 --> 1:09:29.020\n because my whole body would break out again.\n\n1:09:29.020 --> 1:09:31.100\n I wonder if it's like deviating from the process\n\n1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:34.220\n that you so like perfectly crafted already.\n\n1:09:34.220 --> 1:09:36.740\n Or it was stress from my mind thinking,\n\n1:09:36.740 --> 1:09:39.700\n like even though it's not top of mind,\n\n1:09:39.700 --> 1:09:41.820\n there's probably a portion of me that like the Olympics\n\n1:09:41.820 --> 1:09:46.020\n is coming around and it could be my last, that like my body\n\n1:09:46.020 --> 1:09:48.980\n just reacted to something chemically.\n\n1:09:48.980 --> 1:09:50.880\n So I was breaking out in hives.\n\n1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:55.740\n I actually bought like a 600 euro Hugo boss suit\n\n1:09:55.740 --> 1:09:59.100\n because when I was in the Netherlands training at the time,\n\n1:09:59.100 --> 1:10:00.780\n I thought I had bed bugs\n\n1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:02.700\n because I was getting bit everywhere.\n\n1:10:02.700 --> 1:10:04.660\n Then I thought there was something in the detergent\n\n1:10:04.660 --> 1:10:07.560\n at the local thing, so I threw away all my clothes.\n\n1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:09.260\n Like I was paying for showers\n\n1:10:09.260 --> 1:10:11.740\n because I was trying to get the detergent off my body\n\n1:10:11.740 --> 1:10:13.620\n and buying new clothes at the airport.\n\n1:10:14.940 --> 1:10:16.140\n Trying to figure it out.\n\n1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:18.100\n Trying to figure it out and just go, yeah,\n\n1:10:18.100 --> 1:10:19.220\n accepting the situation.\n\n1:10:19.220 --> 1:10:22.300\n I mean, but the level of stress is exceptionally high here.\n\n1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:24.580\n Can we talk about the other side?\n\n1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:26.740\n People are gonna love this.\n\n1:10:26.740 --> 1:10:31.740\n But you have a long history of persevering through injuries,\n\n1:10:34.460 --> 1:10:36.660\n through insane amounts of injuries.\n\n1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:39.060\n My ability to tolerate pain\n\n1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:41.740\n is probably more than most people.\n\n1:10:41.740 --> 1:10:44.760\n But see, injuries aren't just pain, right?\n\n1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:49.180\n It's like, it's also mental, like psychological.\n\n1:10:49.180 --> 1:10:51.260\n Like again, like the weight cut,\n\n1:10:51.260 --> 1:10:53.040\n it can make a lot of people quit.\n\n1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:54.420\n Yep.\n\n1:10:54.420 --> 1:10:57.940\n Can you tell your history of injuries?\n\n1:10:57.940 --> 1:10:59.660\n What are the biggest injuries,\n\n1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:01.560\n the toughest injuries in your career?\n\n1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:05.460\n Starting from what, your early teens?\n\n1:11:05.460 --> 1:11:09.820\n My early teens, I actually got out of sports\n\n1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:14.820\n from 11 to, I wanna say like 15 years old, 16 years old,\n\n1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:18.740\n because a kid shot a double leg through my kneecap\n\n1:11:18.740 --> 1:11:21.100\n and I partially tore all the ligaments in my knee,\n\n1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:23.580\n cartilage, meniscus, the whole nine yards.\n\n1:11:23.580 --> 1:11:25.340\n And I had to learn how to walk again.\n\n1:11:25.340 --> 1:11:29.780\n I spent two years in a leg brace, crutches,\n\n1:11:29.780 --> 1:11:32.100\n hobbling around the school yard.\n\n1:11:32.100 --> 1:11:36.180\n That one was a challenge to come back from.\n\n1:11:36.180 --> 1:11:39.160\n I've broken most of my ribs.\n\n1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:42.060\n I won nationals with nine broken ribs.\n\n1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:45.540\n I was actually getting Novocaine shots into my chest\n\n1:11:45.540 --> 1:11:47.420\n to avoid feeling the pain\n\n1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:49.780\n and then wrapping them to try to\n\n1:11:49.780 --> 1:11:51.220\n make sure I didn't pop alone.\n\n1:11:53.860 --> 1:11:55.980\n I've broken my collarbone.\n\n1:11:55.980 --> 1:11:58.400\n I have five herniated disc in my neck.\n\n1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:00.720\n I fractured my back twice.\n\n1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:02.300\n I've broken my tailbone.\n\n1:12:02.300 --> 1:12:04.780\n I tore my SI joints.\n\n1:12:04.780 --> 1:12:08.160\n I've torn my right hamstring twice, my left one once.\n\n1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:13.920\n Broken my ankles a few times.\n\n1:12:13.920 --> 1:12:16.500\n I spun it once in a 360 that had dev surgery.\n\n1:12:18.140 --> 1:12:20.860\n Fingers, toes, elbows, shoulders.\n\n1:12:20.860 --> 1:12:22.620\n So all of these are, first of all,\n\n1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:28.620\n you're a tough dude, man.\n\n1:12:28.620 --> 1:12:32.720\n So each of those have a story behind them.\n\n1:12:33.720 --> 1:12:37.300\n So if you're talking about the collarbone or the ankles\n\n1:12:38.940 --> 1:12:41.260\n or the back, the neck,\n\n1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:43.100\n is there interesting stories here\n\n1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:44.740\n that are behind these injuries?\n\n1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:49.740\n Hard training, hard competing, jiu jitsu, judo.\n\n1:12:49.820 --> 1:12:53.780\n So ground stuff like sparring in the dojo\n\n1:12:53.780 --> 1:12:56.520\n or like drilling or all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:59.260\n If you were to sort of break it down,\n\n1:12:59.260 --> 1:13:01.080\n your understanding of the landscape\n\n1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.120\n of injuries you went through.\n\n1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:07.020\n I've never had one in jiu jitsu, ever.\n\n1:13:07.880 --> 1:13:09.940\n I mean, I might've like torn a fingernail\n\n1:13:09.940 --> 1:13:12.880\n or like gotten key burned,\n\n1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:16.840\n but I've never been like seriously injured.\n\n1:13:16.840 --> 1:13:20.640\n I know when Ponza straight ankle locked me at Copa Podio,\n\n1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:24.680\n that hurt, but I wasn't injured.\n\n1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:28.760\n Like it felt sore, but if I had to run, I could run.\n\n1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:31.200\n I can now understand probably exactly\n\n1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.000\n what the injuries came from then.\n\n1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.400\n You very quickly excelled at jiu jitsu.\n\n1:13:36.360 --> 1:13:39.040\n You achieved another level in judo.\n\n1:13:39.040 --> 1:13:41.880\n And I think that means the intensity\n\n1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.280\n with which you approached judo.\n\n1:13:44.280 --> 1:13:47.000\n To achieve that world class level\n\n1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.280\n probably is the source of the injuries.\n\n1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:54.280\n Yeah, because the mentality of how I approached judo\n\n1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:57.120\n versus jiu jitsu.\n\n1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:02.120\n Jiu jitsu to me is like a game that like we would play.\n\n1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:04.680\n Like if you wanted to like grab a basketball\n\n1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:07.520\n and like go play a game of one on one,\n\n1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.040\n that's like jiu jitsu to me.\n\n1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:13.720\n Like I can't take the sport in its entirety seriously.\n\n1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:15.680\n Cause I feel like the community of jiu jitsu\n\n1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:17.360\n doesn't take it seriously.\n\n1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:19.240\n So just for people who don't know,\n\n1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:21.400\n just to set some context,\n\n1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:24.080\n you're a black belt in jiu jitsu,\n\n1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:25.640\n but more importantly,\n\n1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:29.920\n you've beaten a lot of world class jiu jitsu people.\n\n1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:33.040\n You've done very well at the highest levels of competition.\n\n1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:35.440\n Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily say I've beaten them\n\n1:14:35.440 --> 1:14:39.080\n as much as I've trained with them.\n\n1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:43.000\n And they understand whoever it is\n\n1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.520\n that through training with me,\n\n1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:48.640\n that like, I'm not just a judo guy.\n\n1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:52.040\n Like I know how to do jiu jitsu, right?\n\n1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:56.680\n And if any one of them were to come to me and like say,\n\n1:14:56.680 --> 1:15:01.680\n hey, I wanna feel what it feels like to do judo with me.\n\n1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:07.280\n They would quickly understand\n\n1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:09.560\n that like the way I approach one\n\n1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:12.040\n is very different than the way I approach the other.\n\n1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:14.160\n Like we probably wouldn't be friends\n\n1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:17.440\n if they did judo with me versus if they did jiu jitsu with me.\n\n1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:19.440\n I'm curious asking for a friend\n\n1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:22.880\n because mostly because I'll do a little judo with you today.\n\n1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:25.600\n So you clearly, cause you're a great instructor and teacher,\n\n1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:28.520\n you have a mode where you can demonstrate a technique.\n\n1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:33.400\n Do you know how to like spar where you're going like 50%?\n\n1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:37.040\n It's hard to put like a percentage to it\n\n1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:42.040\n because I've never in all of my jiu jitsu ever gone 100%.\n\n1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:43.480\n In jiu jitsu?\n\n1:15:43.480 --> 1:15:44.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:47.520\n Like I had a conversation with Salo one time\n\n1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:51.200\n where we were talking about like jiu jitsu and training.\n\n1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:54.600\n And I was like, well, if I got his arm, I would just break it.\n\n1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:59.280\n And he was like, but what if he tapped?\n\n1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:01.740\n I go, that's not my responsibility.\n\n1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.800\n If he taps and the ref doesn't say anything,\n\n1:16:04.800 --> 1:16:05.880\n you just break it.\n\n1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:07.320\n You just keep going.\n\n1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:08.920\n He goes, but the tap means it's over.\n\n1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:11.280\n And I said, no, the ref tells me when it's over.\n\n1:16:11.280 --> 1:16:14.360\n I go, I never give you the opportunity to tap.\n\n1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.320\n Cause if you have the opportunity to tap,\n\n1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:18.520\n that means you had the opportunity to think about\n\n1:16:18.520 --> 1:16:23.200\n how to get out, make a decision that you can't, then tap.\n\n1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:25.200\n I clearly operated too slowly.\n\n1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:29.480\n So there's a, it's either broken or I don't have it.\n\n1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:33.160\n You're a terrifying person to go against in Judo.\n\n1:16:33.160 --> 1:16:36.820\n Like on the ground, like everything you did, that's amazing.\n\n1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:39.000\n That's really amazing.\n\n1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.000\n That's what made you a really fun person to watch.\n\n1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:44.120\n Cause you really went to war with these people.\n\n1:16:44.120 --> 1:16:45.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.560\n So you know what it's like to go a hundred percent in Judo.\n\n1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:48.400\n I do.\n\n1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:52.280\n Cause I know what it's like to train with somebody\n\n1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:54.280\n under the mentality of,\n\n1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:56.480\n I'm going to do everything I want to do.\n\n1:16:56.480 --> 1:16:59.180\n You're going to do nothing you want to do.\n\n1:16:59.180 --> 1:17:00.720\n And you're going to accept that.\n\n1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:05.400\n Do you ever train in Judo where you let people get stuff?\n\n1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:08.440\n Of course, all the time.\n\n1:17:08.440 --> 1:17:09.840\n Now, or like.\n\n1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:10.860\n Always.\n\n1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:12.880\n Even when you're sort of building up the four years,\n\n1:17:12.880 --> 1:17:14.520\n building up to the Olympics,\n\n1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:17.480\n like there's smaller guys that are throwing you in the gym\n\n1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:18.360\n and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:19.520\n No, I never said that.\n\n1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:20.360\n Okay.\n\n1:17:21.840 --> 1:17:24.280\n That never came out of my mouth.\n\n1:17:24.280 --> 1:17:25.720\n I said, I let people do stuff.\n\n1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:27.920\n I never said smaller people throw me.\n\n1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:29.500\n Oh, you mean you let them get a grip,\n\n1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:31.280\n but then you'll position yourself on such a way\n\n1:17:31.280 --> 1:17:32.720\n that it's hopeless.\n\n1:17:32.720 --> 1:17:33.600\n It's like.\n\n1:17:33.600 --> 1:17:37.760\n The number one skillset that Judo is going to teach you\n\n1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:41.700\n is the ability to give people false hope.\n\n1:17:43.980 --> 1:17:44.820\n Right?\n\n1:17:44.820 --> 1:17:45.640\n Cause I can let.\n\n1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:46.480\n I'm really looking forward to the video\n\n1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:47.720\n we're going to shoot later today.\n\n1:17:47.720 --> 1:17:50.640\n Like I can let you take a grip.\n\n1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:52.880\n I can let you think that there's opportunity,\n\n1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:54.840\n but what you don't understand is\n\n1:17:54.840 --> 1:17:57.280\n by the position and angle that I'm in,\n\n1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:59.280\n it's actually false hope.\n\n1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:02.160\n Like, as long as you don't know that it is,\n\n1:18:02.160 --> 1:18:04.880\n then now I'm free to operate and do what I want.\n\n1:18:04.880 --> 1:18:08.560\n See, I competed in Judo against black belts\n\n1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:12.280\n where I would go in and it looks like\n\n1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:13.600\n I could should be able to throw them.\n\n1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:15.360\n And then you just hit a wall.\n\n1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:18.720\n And then I also saw you destroy those black belts.\n\n1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:19.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:19.560 --> 1:18:20.400\n So there's levels to this.\n\n1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:21.240\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:21.240 --> 1:18:23.380\n It's the cliche thing of there's black belts\n\n1:18:23.380 --> 1:18:24.900\n and there's black belts.\n\n1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:26.160\n You're unique in this.\n\n1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:29.420\n There may be a couple other Jidoka in America,\n\n1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:30.680\n but you're really like unique.\n\n1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:34.080\n I then get to see people that really\n\n1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:37.880\n I felt like were 10X better than me.\n\n1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.360\n It just feels like that sometimes.\n\n1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:41.720\n I've learned that madness and it said it'd be truly\n\n1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:44.000\n might only be just a little better,\n\n1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.720\n but I saw you destroy them.\n\n1:18:46.720 --> 1:18:49.260\n And it was like, holy shit.\n\n1:18:49.260 --> 1:18:51.360\n There's a thing in Judo, right?\n\n1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:56.360\n Where, you know, imagine like you as like just an adult,\n\n1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:57.400\n right?\n\n1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:01.780\n And I hope people can like conceptualize this\n\n1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:02.620\n when they hear this,\n\n1:19:02.620 --> 1:19:04.920\n but imagine like you're a full grown adult,\n\n1:19:04.920 --> 1:19:07.180\n even male, female, it doesn't matter,\n\n1:19:07.180 --> 1:19:08.440\n but there's a little kid in front of you,\n\n1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:12.800\n like call him five or six years old and he's acting out.\n\n1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:15.720\n Like, do you think you have the physical capability\n\n1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:19.320\n of with one hand grabbing that person or that kid\n\n1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:21.880\n and making sure that they freeze?\n\n1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:23.480\n Like they feel like they're nervous\n\n1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.080\n and like they can't do anything.\n\n1:19:26.520 --> 1:19:30.020\n When you fight a good Judo player, when they grab you,\n\n1:19:30.020 --> 1:19:32.200\n that's what it feels like as an adult.\n\n1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:36.560\n And even I've felt that from like certain players in Japan,\n\n1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:37.440\n like when they get a grip,\n\n1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:41.560\n I'm like, I've now lost the function of this one.\n\n1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:43.200\n That's a really good way to put it.\n\n1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:46.280\n I think I could potentially beat some of the people\n\n1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:50.520\n I've went against, but certain groups they took,\n\n1:19:50.520 --> 1:19:53.880\n it made me feel powerless.\n\n1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:56.160\n I was like, I didn't know this was possible.\n\n1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:57.900\n That kind of power was possible.\n\n1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:00.280\n And you don't even know where it originates from.\n\n1:20:00.280 --> 1:20:02.700\n Cause you're like, how does one person's hand do this\n\n1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:04.920\n where I can't use my whole arm?\n\n1:20:04.920 --> 1:20:06.880\n Or like, I can't pick up my right foot\n\n1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:09.320\n because he's holding onto my right sleeve.\n\n1:20:09.320 --> 1:20:13.160\n It was kind of on a basic animalistic sense,\n\n1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:15.120\n kind of terrifying.\n\n1:20:15.120 --> 1:20:16.840\n It's, I mean, you don't want to,\n\n1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:20.400\n part of this is like ego,\n\n1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:22.940\n but you realize that there's a food chain\n\n1:20:22.940 --> 1:20:24.580\n and you're not at the top of it.\n\n1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:28.120\n That's part of the humbling process,\n\n1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:29.160\n I think of martial arts.\n\n1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:31.380\n It's like, I think everybody,\n\n1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:36.360\n like a lot of people think they're much higher\n\n1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:37.200\n in the food chain than they are.\n\n1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:38.640\n Than they really are.\n\n1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:39.960\n And then when you realize,\n\n1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:42.040\n this is why it's a really healthy process for people\n\n1:20:42.040 --> 1:20:45.060\n that are not even competing in the Olympics\n\n1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:46.240\n to practice martial arts.\n\n1:20:46.240 --> 1:20:47.500\n Cause you realize, okay,\n\n1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:49.960\n that like putting yourself more accurately\n\n1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:53.160\n in the food chain is really good way\n\n1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:55.480\n to sort of place yourself in the rest of the world.\n\n1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:58.520\n It humbles you to the reality, the harshness of the world.\n\n1:20:58.520 --> 1:20:59.640\n Yep.\n\n1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:01.720\n It's kind of like when people look at like survival\n\n1:21:01.720 --> 1:21:04.960\n in the wilderness, it's like, oh, it's not that hard.\n\n1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:07.520\n No, you'd probably be dying in a couple of days.\n\n1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:09.840\n Same thing with like judo and martial arts.\n\n1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:13.180\n Like, yeah, it's really not that hard,\n\n1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:15.420\n but you don't know what to do yet.\n\n1:21:15.420 --> 1:21:17.160\n And so when you find out that first time\n\n1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:18.920\n that you don't know what to do,\n\n1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:21.120\n it's devastating to a lot of people,\n\n1:21:21.120 --> 1:21:24.740\n but those that like stick through it and like start to learn,\n\n1:21:24.740 --> 1:21:27.880\n it's a very powerful, like feeling that now,\n\n1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:29.900\n like you can take care of yourself.\n\n1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:34.780\n And I think I want to talk to you a few times before\n\n1:21:34.780 --> 1:21:35.620\n you talked about that.\n\n1:21:35.620 --> 1:21:38.900\n There's like, like the top three, the top five in the world.\n\n1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:40.280\n I don't know where you put them,\n\n1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:43.440\n but they're, they're another like level above.\n\n1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.040\n They're a whole nother tier, yeah.\n\n1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:46.880\n And the fact that you're, I mean, it's,\n\n1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:50.440\n it's so exciting to me probably\n\n1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:54.120\n because I just felt all the levels here\n\n1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:59.120\n and I've seen you and others at that height destroy those.\n\n1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:03.820\n I've seen the exponential levels to this game.\n\n1:22:03.820 --> 1:22:08.320\n It's incredible that you're, didn't quit,\n\n1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:11.560\n didn't doubt yourself and just persevered\n\n1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.000\n through three Olympics to get to that highest,\n\n1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:18.120\n always fighting at that like very highest of levels,\n\n1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:21.880\n but just like, you know, from the top 10 to the top five,\n\n1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:25.580\n like really breaking in through that, I don't know.\n\n1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:30.880\n What would you say it took to get to that highest of levels?\n\n1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:33.080\n Like if you, when you look back to all the weight cuts,\n\n1:22:33.080 --> 1:22:36.960\n to just the insane amount of injuries, believe it or not,\n\n1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:41.280\n I didn't really think I was there until 2013.\n\n1:22:42.960 --> 1:22:45.840\n I thought I was recognized as one of the best\n\n1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:47.960\n because I was able to fight for Oppensburg,\n\n1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:50.600\n which was the professional Bundesliga team for Germany,\n\n1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:52.920\n which is one of the top clubs in all of Europe.\n\n1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.000\n When they asked me to, I felt like Europe had like accepted\n\n1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:02.480\n me as like, oh, I'm a top level judo player,\n\n1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:05.460\n but I don't necessarily think that when I signed on\n\n1:23:05.460 --> 1:23:08.800\n to compete for them, that the division or the world\n\n1:23:08.800 --> 1:23:11.960\n of judo saw me as a top level judo player, right?\n\n1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:16.960\n There's a mental shift that happens along that point.\n\n1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:21.960\n And for me, my mental shift really came into play\n\n1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:26.640\n in December of 2015 before Rio.\n\n1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:30.440\n That was like, when I lost in Japan,\n\n1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:34.960\n that's when I realized like the world respects my abilities\n\n1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:36.520\n and they compete against them.\n\n1:23:37.720 --> 1:23:40.400\n They don't compete against me as a person.\n\n1:23:40.400 --> 1:23:49.400\n They compete against the idea or the persona\n\n1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:52.760\n that I've been able to establish over the years\n\n1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:54.200\n of competing in the division.\n\n1:23:54.200 --> 1:23:57.760\n Wow, so you're the, they probably have a nickname for you.\n\n1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:02.080\n You're the system of ideas and thought that they study.\n\n1:24:02.080 --> 1:24:06.540\n But they're studying me as a conceptual whole,\n\n1:24:06.540 --> 1:24:07.860\n not me as the human.\n\n1:24:07.860 --> 1:24:12.860\n Is your style relatively unique in the 81 kilogram division?\n\n1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:18.500\n It was relatively unique for Kayla, I and Jimmy\n\n1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.760\n up until 2016.\n\n1:24:20.760 --> 1:24:25.380\n Now since 2016, you can see a lot of what we used to do\n\n1:24:25.380 --> 1:24:27.760\n throughout most of Europe and even Asia.\n\n1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:29.580\n Like you're starting to see some of those techniques\n\n1:24:29.580 --> 1:24:32.660\n that you didn't see before starting to get implemented.\n\n1:24:32.660 --> 1:24:37.660\n Because when I was gearing up for 2015,\n\n1:24:38.940 --> 1:24:42.820\n I had such a slew of injuries that entire calendar year\n\n1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:46.340\n that I never should have made it to Rio.\n\n1:24:46.340 --> 1:24:49.420\n I should have called it quits at the end of 2015\n\n1:24:49.420 --> 1:24:54.060\n because I suffered that major concussion in February.\n\n1:24:54.060 --> 1:24:57.620\n I stepped on a mat in May for the first time.\n\n1:24:57.620 --> 1:24:59.960\n I lost five straight tournaments.\n\n1:24:59.960 --> 1:25:04.960\n I left the national team, went to Japan, won Pan Am games,\n\n1:25:05.500 --> 1:25:07.500\n got a bacterial infection at the Worlds,\n\n1:25:07.500 --> 1:25:10.860\n almost had my leg cut off, tore my SI joint later\n\n1:25:10.860 --> 1:25:14.240\n on that year, and then took fifth in Japan.\n\n1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:17.360\n And when you look at like the calendar year as a whole,\n\n1:25:18.300 --> 1:25:22.220\n like the world should have treated me like I was washed up.\n\n1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:23.620\n Like this guy hasn't been training,\n\n1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.800\n he hasn't been doing anything, but I took fifth in Japan.\n\n1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.300\n Now, how does a guy that hasn't trained all year\n\n1:25:30.300 --> 1:25:32.580\n take fifth at one of the hardest tournaments in the world\n\n1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:33.940\n on two weeks of training?\n\n1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:38.260\n Because they were fighting the guy I used to be,\n\n1:25:40.300 --> 1:25:42.460\n not the guy I was at the tournament,\n\n1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:45.920\n which means they were competing under the idea of like,\n\n1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:48.260\n what is he really capable of?\n\n1:25:48.260 --> 1:25:50.540\n Not what have I brought to the table today?\n\n1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:54.700\n And that just gave you the confidence.\n\n1:25:54.700 --> 1:25:57.900\n And that told me that like, well, if I can take fifth\n\n1:25:57.900 --> 1:26:00.580\n and I'm this bad at judo right now,\n\n1:26:00.580 --> 1:26:03.140\n wait until I'm healthy and I'm back in shape,\n\n1:26:03.140 --> 1:26:04.780\n then they're not gonna know what hit them.\n\n1:26:04.780 --> 1:26:07.180\n One of the essential components of being the number one\n\n1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:10.980\n in the world or up in that place is that confidence,\n\n1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:11.980\n the self belief.\n\n1:26:11.980 --> 1:26:13.980\n And the rest of the world believing it.\n\n1:26:14.940 --> 1:26:16.540\n You can have all the confidence in the world,\n\n1:26:16.540 --> 1:26:20.100\n but if the rest of the room doesn't buy it, it's nothing.\n\n1:26:20.100 --> 1:26:21.060\n That's funny.\n\n1:26:21.060 --> 1:26:22.620\n It's like, there's certain people, right?\n\n1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:24.980\n Oh, Tyson, Mike Tyson.\n\n1:26:24.980 --> 1:26:27.780\n They all understand he could not train\n\n1:26:27.780 --> 1:26:30.220\n and they're still scared, right?\n\n1:26:30.220 --> 1:26:32.420\n Like he doesn't have to work out that hard anymore.\n\n1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:34.900\n There's several judo, you know this way better,\n\n1:26:34.900 --> 1:26:36.380\n but from a spectator perspective,\n\n1:26:36.380 --> 1:26:38.140\n like Ilias Iliadis is like that.\n\n1:26:38.140 --> 1:26:39.460\n He's one of them.\n\n1:26:39.460 --> 1:26:41.300\n It's like, he.\n\n1:26:41.300 --> 1:26:42.780\n He's portrayed over the years.\n\n1:26:42.780 --> 1:26:44.740\n Why is everyone so scared of that guy?\n\n1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:46.940\n It's interesting.\n\n1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:47.780\n Yep.\n\n1:26:47.780 --> 1:26:49.280\n People were scared of you too.\n\n1:26:49.280 --> 1:26:54.040\n People just gave a certain level of respect to my skillset\n\n1:26:54.040 --> 1:26:56.360\n and whether I had a bad weight cut\n\n1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.200\n or didn't have a bad weight cut\n\n1:26:58.200 --> 1:27:00.120\n or not trained for the last three months,\n\n1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:02.360\n which never happened, I'm just saying,\n\n1:27:02.360 --> 1:27:04.320\n they were gonna fight the persona.\n\n1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:07.480\n And it's an important distinction\n\n1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:08.840\n when you're looking at the top five\n\n1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:12.120\n because everybody coming up,\n\n1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:16.880\n they're training against the persona, not who you are.\n\n1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:19.880\n Even I did that at a younger age.\n\n1:27:19.880 --> 1:27:22.660\n That's why I would always go to people's hometowns\n\n1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:25.120\n because I don't care about the persona.\n\n1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:27.980\n I wanna know what you do day in and day out.\n\n1:27:27.980 --> 1:27:29.060\n When I couldn't beat a Russian,\n\n1:27:29.060 --> 1:27:30.760\n I told Jimmy, send me to Russia.\n\n1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:34.320\n I need to understand and see it with my own eyes\n\n1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:36.020\n what they do, outperform,\n\n1:27:36.020 --> 1:27:39.880\n so that I can believe that I can beat them.\n\n1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:41.760\n Can I ask you on this, a small tangent.\n\n1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:46.360\n Dagestan has produced some incredible wrestlers.\n\n1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:48.560\n I don't know what the story with judo is,\n\n1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:53.560\n where the source of greatness in Russia is for judo,\n\n1:27:53.740 --> 1:27:55.520\n but what do you make of Dagestan?\n\n1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:00.120\n Why, what is it in the culture of there or Russia broadly\n\n1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:01.620\n that produces greatness?\n\n1:28:02.700 --> 1:28:05.340\n Specifically in the combat sports.\n\n1:28:05.340 --> 1:28:07.520\n I don't know, yeah, specifically in the combat sports,\n\n1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:09.720\n sorry, but I don't know if you wanna draw a distinction\n\n1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:10.920\n between wrestling and judo.\n\n1:28:10.920 --> 1:28:11.880\n I'm almost curious,\n\n1:28:11.880 --> 1:28:15.120\n do you understand the differences there in the culture?\n\n1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:17.120\n It's still a combat sport to them.\n\n1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:20.280\n They're still in that same like realm\n\n1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:25.280\n of they're taking young kids and that's what they do.\n\n1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:29.120\n So Khabib speaks very highly of judo.\n\n1:28:29.980 --> 1:28:33.520\n It's funny, Khabib, Vladimir Putin.\n\n1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:34.340\n People don't get it,\n\n1:28:34.340 --> 1:28:37.440\n but like judo is like one of the premier sports\n\n1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:39.920\n in the world, but we just don't understand it.\n\n1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:42.440\n It's not just popularity, so definitely popularity,\n\n1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:44.880\n but also like this respect.\n\n1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:47.040\n And there's a certain thing,\n\n1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:50.440\n which is why I really value judo internationally.\n\n1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:51.760\n You don't get this in the United States,\n\n1:28:51.760 --> 1:28:55.280\n but internationally there's an understanding,\n\n1:28:55.280 --> 1:28:56.880\n like later in life,\n\n1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:59.960\n when you're a scientist meeting a businessman,\n\n1:28:59.960 --> 1:29:01.620\n when you both have done judo,\n\n1:29:01.620 --> 1:29:04.520\n there's this like nod of respect.\n\n1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:06.320\n It's so interesting.\n\n1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:07.840\n There's very few sports like that.\n\n1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:09.320\n Basketball doesn't have any,\n\n1:29:09.320 --> 1:29:11.680\n I don't know almost any sport like that.\n\n1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.640\n And it's fascinating.\n\n1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:16.560\n Wrestling has that in the US, but it's the US only.\n\n1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.100\n The rest of the world doesn't do that.\n\n1:29:18.100 --> 1:29:21.020\n There's a few, like you could see that in like Iran\n\n1:29:21.020 --> 1:29:21.860\n or something like that.\n\n1:29:21.860 --> 1:29:24.680\n They'll respect wrestling in that kind of way.\n\n1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:26.440\n Yeah, it's...\n\n1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:28.160\n But judo on like a global scale\n\n1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:29.800\n is probably that only one,\n\n1:29:30.760 --> 1:29:34.480\n due to its like physicality and the hardships\n\n1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:38.120\n that you have to go through to reach that upper level.\n\n1:29:38.120 --> 1:29:39.520\n So why do you think Dagestan,\n\n1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:41.400\n why do you think Khabib is as good as he is?\n\n1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:44.880\n Is this just the raw genetics of the human\n\n1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:46.840\n or is there something about the system?\n\n1:29:46.840 --> 1:29:47.680\n The system.\n\n1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:50.920\n It's all has to do with the system.\n\n1:29:50.920 --> 1:29:55.560\n So they grow up around fighting in all forms.\n\n1:29:55.560 --> 1:29:56.400\n Yep.\n\n1:29:57.400 --> 1:30:00.460\n They're also, I mean, their technique is exceptionally good.\n\n1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:02.720\n Because they grow up in it.\n\n1:30:02.720 --> 1:30:03.560\n They grow up in it.\n\n1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:08.280\n They don't understand anything else.\n\n1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:09.120\n So you don't have to,\n\n1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:11.160\n it's almost like you with the weight cutting.\n\n1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:13.880\n It's not like a big dramatic thing for them to fight.\n\n1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:16.040\n It's like, this is just part of life.\n\n1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:16.880\n Yes.\n\n1:30:16.880 --> 1:30:20.280\n And when you're, I don't wanna say bred into it,\n\n1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:23.360\n but when you've done it for,\n\n1:30:24.300 --> 1:30:26.640\n I wanna say like 90% of your life\n\n1:30:26.640 --> 1:30:29.320\n by the time like Khabib probably has,\n\n1:30:29.320 --> 1:30:30.720\n right from the time he could crawl,\n\n1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:34.320\n he's probably even grappling in some fashion thereof, right?\n\n1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:38.920\n When you, as grapplers,\n\n1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:42.760\n like you can look at a wrestler and having never seen\n\n1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:45.960\n this person before and go, you wrestled.\n\n1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:47.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:47.120 --> 1:30:48.280\n Why is that?\n\n1:30:48.280 --> 1:30:51.600\n It's because he's probably wrestled since he was like six.\n\n1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:53.920\n So the way he carries himself,\n\n1:30:53.920 --> 1:30:55.720\n the way his body is built,\n\n1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:00.720\n the way he grew into it was framed around wrestling, right?\n\n1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:03.600\n So the people in that culture are framed\n\n1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:06.200\n around fighting and grappling.\n\n1:31:06.200 --> 1:31:07.040\n You're right.\n\n1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:10.320\n First of all, philosophically, psychologically,\n\n1:31:10.320 --> 1:31:12.240\n but also just like the way you move your body.\n\n1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:13.080\n Yes.\n\n1:31:13.080 --> 1:31:14.680\n That means like when you're young,\n\n1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:16.600\n the people you admire move their body\n\n1:31:16.600 --> 1:31:17.960\n in a certain kind of way.\n\n1:31:17.960 --> 1:31:22.060\n And then genetically, it just, as they keep doing that,\n\n1:31:22.060 --> 1:31:25.480\n they're just gonna get better and better every generation.\n\n1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:26.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:27.840\n It's just gonna keep improving\n\n1:31:27.840 --> 1:31:30.000\n because they just keep building into that system\n\n1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:31.400\n of turning them out.\n\n1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:34.360\n And part of it, there's like cultural stuff where,\n\n1:31:34.360 --> 1:31:36.640\n I mean, it's such an interesting approach to wrestling.\n\n1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:39.440\n I really wanna travel to Dagestan and just talk to them\n\n1:31:39.440 --> 1:31:42.020\n because I happen to be able to speak Russian.\n\n1:31:42.020 --> 1:31:45.460\n Because there's less value\n\n1:31:45.460 --> 1:31:49.520\n for this kind of materialistic success\n\n1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:53.500\n that I think sometimes can get in the way of greatness,\n\n1:31:53.500 --> 1:31:54.580\n it seems like.\n\n1:31:54.580 --> 1:31:56.420\n It makes coaching more difficult.\n\n1:31:56.420 --> 1:31:59.800\n It makes like following orders as an athlete more difficult.\n\n1:31:59.800 --> 1:32:00.640\n I don't know.\n\n1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:02.300\n We struggle with that in USA judo.\n\n1:32:02.300 --> 1:32:03.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:05.080\n Cause you want more money,\n\n1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:08.100\n but then more money, if not applied correctly,\n\n1:32:08.100 --> 1:32:09.760\n can corrupt the system.\n\n1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:11.160\n Somehow it can split people up.\n\n1:32:11.160 --> 1:32:13.200\n It's just, it's same thing with the prestige\n\n1:32:13.200 --> 1:32:15.100\n around certain medals over others\n\n1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:20.100\n because athletes start chasing fame instead of development.\n\n1:32:22.040 --> 1:32:23.500\n Yeah.\n\n1:32:23.500 --> 1:32:26.320\n Yeah, that's, I mean, the Setia brothers\n\n1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:29.520\n are famous for this, like ignoring fame,\n\n1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:31.960\n ignoring all of this, like focus on the art itself.\n\n1:32:31.960 --> 1:32:34.280\n Not even, so it's not even the medals,\n\n1:32:34.280 --> 1:32:35.320\n exactly like you're saying,\n\n1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:38.040\n just the purity of like when you're in it\n\n1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:40.280\n and let everybody else figure out their stupid medals\n\n1:32:40.280 --> 1:32:41.160\n and money and all that.\n\n1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:42.160\n Cause it comes.\n\n1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:43.000\n It comes.\n\n1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:43.820\n Exactly.\n\n1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:44.660\n It's a result.\n\n1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:45.500\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:32:45.500 --> 1:32:46.880\n Like it's not that you don't appreciate it,\n\n1:32:46.880 --> 1:32:50.320\n but you know that it comes if you focus on the art.\n\n1:32:50.320 --> 1:32:53.400\n There's a distinction when you're talking\n\n1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:58.400\n about your athletic career or really any endeavor, right?\n\n1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:03.340\n The problem with goal setting is nobody teaches the athletes\n\n1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:06.240\n or the people how to transition\n\n1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:08.960\n from the goal to reality, right?\n\n1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:12.560\n So when you look at my career as a whole,\n\n1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:15.160\n like when I was getting ready for 2008,\n\n1:33:15.160 --> 1:33:17.260\n I actually forgot to train for it.\n\n1:33:17.260 --> 1:33:19.480\n I was so happy at such a young age\n\n1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:22.600\n that I became an Olympian that that in and of itself\n\n1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:25.660\n was a goal that I thought had to be admired,\n\n1:33:25.660 --> 1:33:28.040\n had to be celebrated that, you know,\n\n1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:30.020\n the games are right around the corner.\n\n1:33:30.020 --> 1:33:32.640\n I didn't really come down off that high.\n\n1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:37.080\n You're the local optimum of just winning the trials.\n\n1:33:37.080 --> 1:33:37.920\n Yeah.\n\n1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:38.760\n That was.\n\n1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:39.580\n It's a big thing.\n\n1:33:39.580 --> 1:33:40.420\n It's a huge thing.\n\n1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:42.320\n But then you're just focusing on the accomplishment,\n\n1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:43.160\n not the.\n\n1:33:43.160 --> 1:33:43.980\n Correct.\n\n1:33:43.980 --> 1:33:48.880\n But at some point, right, when I went into London,\n\n1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:51.540\n I actually went into London going with,\n\n1:33:51.540 --> 1:33:53.280\n I'm gonna prove I'm the best in the world\n\n1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:55.440\n cause I believe I'm the best in the world.\n\n1:33:55.440 --> 1:33:58.560\n And I believe it from like the bottom of my soul\n\n1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.380\n that I'm winning this.\n\n1:34:00.380 --> 1:34:04.320\n And then you're almost like trying to tell the universe,\n\n1:34:04.320 --> 1:34:07.640\n like I'm accomplishing this thing because it's a goal.\n\n1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:09.080\n But when I went into Rio,\n\n1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:13.780\n I just accepted the fact that I was winning.\n\n1:34:13.780 --> 1:34:14.620\n It's not a goal.\n\n1:34:14.620 --> 1:34:16.780\n Like this is happening.\n\n1:34:16.780 --> 1:34:18.440\n You visualize it.\n\n1:34:18.440 --> 1:34:19.540\n But I felt it.\n\n1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:20.440\n You felt it.\n\n1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:21.280\n Right?\n\n1:34:21.280 --> 1:34:23.120\n Like this is no longer a goal anymore.\n\n1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:27.420\n Like I anticipated, like this is happening.\n\n1:34:27.420 --> 1:34:29.980\n I can see this coming down the path\n\n1:34:29.980 --> 1:34:33.740\n because I'm anticipating that the games is happening\n\n1:34:33.740 --> 1:34:34.580\n and I'm gonna win.\n\n1:34:34.580 --> 1:34:35.860\n It's not a goal.\n\n1:34:35.860 --> 1:34:36.820\n It's an anticipation.\n\n1:34:36.820 --> 1:34:39.140\n And there's a distinct distinction there\n\n1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:39.980\n between the two.\n\n1:34:41.380 --> 1:34:44.660\n Okay, so for people who are just watching the video of this,\n\n1:34:44.660 --> 1:34:49.660\n there should be an overlay of Young Travis.\n\n1:34:50.140 --> 1:34:52.780\n This is, you still had to make 81.\n\n1:34:52.780 --> 1:34:54.920\n Is this still a tough cut here?\n\n1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:56.680\n No, this one was relatively easy.\n\n1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:59.700\n This is going all the way back to 2008.\n\n1:34:59.700 --> 1:35:03.500\n So this is the summer before the games.\n\n1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:08.500\n This probably happened in June, I would say.\n\n1:35:08.860 --> 1:35:11.740\n So this is the Olympic trials.\n\n1:35:11.740 --> 1:35:13.500\n So in the United States,\n\n1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:15.980\n you have to, I mean, similar to like wrestling,\n\n1:35:15.980 --> 1:35:18.300\n you have to win the trials to qualify\n\n1:35:18.300 --> 1:35:19.880\n for that particular division\n\n1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:21.700\n to represent the United States.\n\n1:35:21.700 --> 1:35:24.600\n So this is, you said June before an August Olympics?\n\n1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:25.740\n Yep.\n\n1:35:25.740 --> 1:35:27.940\n So here, I just wanted to show this match\n\n1:35:27.940 --> 1:35:31.180\n because what was, there's another one.\n\n1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:32.300\n I think you do a pin,\n\n1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:34.420\n you do some nice ground work in the other one.\n\n1:35:34.420 --> 1:35:35.760\n But in this one.\n\n1:35:37.800 --> 1:35:39.300\n Fighting a teammate.\n\n1:35:39.300 --> 1:35:40.260\n Fighting a teammate.\n\n1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:41.100\n Former teammate.\n\n1:35:41.100 --> 1:35:42.440\n Oh, there's an old school double leg.\n\n1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:43.640\n I forgot about that.\n\n1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:44.780\n And it's weird to see.\n\n1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:49.780\n So there, the Travis's opponent,\n\n1:35:49.780 --> 1:35:51.420\n and Travis is setting up here\n\n1:35:51.420 --> 1:35:58.420\n that Sayonagi posting his left arm and getting it done.\n\n1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.380\n That's a big, that's a big throw.\n\n1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:06.060\n You don't have too many of those big throws on video.\n\n1:36:06.060 --> 1:36:07.840\n Cause like you often on video,\n\n1:36:07.840 --> 1:36:09.700\n you're going against the best people in the world.\n\n1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:12.260\n It's tough to get like that much air.\n\n1:36:12.260 --> 1:36:15.040\n And a lot of times the ones that we do see\n\n1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.540\n and the part that a lot of people don't experience\n\n1:36:19.540 --> 1:36:21.780\n is a lot of those times\n\n1:36:21.780 --> 1:36:23.780\n where I threw people with that throw,\n\n1:36:23.780 --> 1:36:25.680\n it was in training camps.\n\n1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:29.020\n So by the time I got to the competition with these guys,\n\n1:36:29.020 --> 1:36:32.000\n they were playing a hundred percent defense\n\n1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:33.400\n to never let me do that.\n\n1:36:33.400 --> 1:36:34.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:36:34.420 --> 1:36:36.900\n So you do this here.\n\n1:36:36.900 --> 1:36:38.420\n Are you kind of pulling him down?\n\n1:36:38.420 --> 1:36:41.580\n No, he's, I'm trying to get him to come up.\n\n1:36:41.580 --> 1:36:43.580\n But are you pulling him down to get to fake him out?\n\n1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:45.680\n I'm not doing anything with my left hand.\n\n1:36:46.960 --> 1:36:48.820\n So here the opponent is.\n\n1:36:48.820 --> 1:36:52.600\n So what I'm doing right now is his head is like in my chest.\n\n1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:57.120\n I'm pressing him to get his head to lift with my chest.\n\n1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:00.980\n So I'm pressing his hand down so I can use my chest\n\n1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:04.180\n to like pinch my scaps and roll his head up\n\n1:37:04.180 --> 1:37:05.680\n so that he wants to pick it up.\n\n1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:10.620\n And then he, I mean, doesn't he know what's coming here?\n\n1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:12.660\n Oh no, he might not.\n\n1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:14.380\n Oh no, he knew, he was a former teammate.\n\n1:37:14.380 --> 1:37:16.540\n He knew exactly what I was trying to do.\n\n1:37:16.540 --> 1:37:20.220\n And that was a really big step with your right foot.\n\n1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:25.220\n It covers about four feet in distance.\n\n1:37:26.380 --> 1:37:31.380\n And your left catches up in like perfect position.\n\n1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:34.380\n Yeah, you back it up a little bit.\n\n1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:39.020\n Keep going, keep going.\n\n1:37:39.020 --> 1:37:41.980\n Right there, this is like an important distinction\n\n1:37:41.980 --> 1:37:44.240\n between mine and everybody else's\n\n1:37:44.240 --> 1:37:47.200\n is because I split his hip,\n\n1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:50.940\n I actually, once I'm able to split,\n\n1:37:50.940 --> 1:37:54.760\n I no longer need his center of gravity below mine.\n\n1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:56.860\n Right, and when you say split,\n\n1:37:56.860 --> 1:37:59.540\n you mean you put your foot in between.\n\n1:37:59.540 --> 1:38:02.180\n I do that split, that four foot split.\n\n1:38:02.180 --> 1:38:04.700\n And then when I get my feet back together,\n\n1:38:04.700 --> 1:38:06.980\n it doesn't matter that I'm under his center of gravity\n\n1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:07.820\n or not.\n\n1:38:09.060 --> 1:38:13.980\n That's why my chest is right around his sternum height\n\n1:38:13.980 --> 1:38:15.180\n for me.\n\n1:38:15.180 --> 1:38:17.900\n Yeah, so there, I mean, how does he get,\n\n1:38:17.900 --> 1:38:19.140\n for people just listening to this,\n\n1:38:19.140 --> 1:38:23.900\n Travis Steps does a big, huge step, gets.\n\n1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:26.860\n Like my hip is probably right around his nipple\n\n1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:28.900\n because he's sprawled back so much.\n\n1:38:28.900 --> 1:38:30.400\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:33.220\n So like, so you're, how does the physics of this work?\n\n1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:36.320\n You're violating the principle of your center of mass\n\n1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:38.900\n being under, oh, I guess somehow it is.\n\n1:38:38.900 --> 1:38:40.820\n I don't know, but he has nowhere to go.\n\n1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:41.940\n He's screwed.\n\n1:38:41.940 --> 1:38:46.940\n Yes, that's the kicker is the way mine works is\n\n1:38:47.580 --> 1:38:50.820\n in order for him to play an effective defense,\n\n1:38:50.820 --> 1:38:53.960\n he needs to have his feet firmly planted on the ground\n\n1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:55.420\n with friction.\n\n1:38:55.420 --> 1:38:56.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:56.260 --> 1:38:59.040\n Otherwise he can't press into me to stop it.\n\n1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:02.340\n So when I get him to sprawl back, when I split his legs,\n\n1:39:02.340 --> 1:39:05.620\n he effectively loses that contact with the floor.\n\n1:39:05.620 --> 1:39:07.700\n Even though his feet are on the floor,\n\n1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:10.200\n they're not in a position where he can drive from them.\n\n1:39:10.200 --> 1:39:11.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:11.040 --> 1:39:12.860\n So therefore when I flip, he flips.\n\n1:39:12.860 --> 1:39:17.700\n So there's a natural like flailing here.\n\n1:39:17.700 --> 1:39:20.260\n So he's not falling forward.\n\n1:39:20.260 --> 1:39:21.700\n You're falling forward.\n\n1:39:21.700 --> 1:39:22.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:23.360\n He's just attached to you.\n\n1:39:23.360 --> 1:39:25.080\n So like you can keep him up there\n\n1:39:25.080 --> 1:39:27.100\n and then like legs would be just flailing.\n\n1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:30.760\n Yep, one of my golden rules when I'm training\n\n1:39:30.760 --> 1:39:33.780\n and I get really tired, one of the like mantras\n\n1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:36.640\n I would always tell myself is I'm gonna put my back\n\n1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:39.580\n on your chest and then I'm gonna put my back on the floor.\n\n1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:40.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:40.420 --> 1:39:41.500\n It's gonna be underneath me.\n\n1:39:41.500 --> 1:39:42.940\n That's a good principle to.\n\n1:39:42.940 --> 1:39:43.940\n It's very simple.\n\n1:39:43.940 --> 1:39:46.500\n And it, regardless of like all the chaos\n\n1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:48.380\n and how quickly things are happening,\n\n1:39:48.380 --> 1:39:50.460\n it's something I can just dumb everything down to\n\n1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:51.820\n and focus on.\n\n1:39:51.820 --> 1:39:54.240\n Regardless of the gripping situation, the footwork,\n\n1:39:54.240 --> 1:39:56.460\n all of that, get my back to your chest\n\n1:39:56.460 --> 1:39:58.180\n and then put my back on the floor.\n\n1:39:58.180 --> 1:40:02.400\n So this step of getting your back to their chest,\n\n1:40:02.400 --> 1:40:04.860\n like for people who are sort of more,\n\n1:40:04.860 --> 1:40:07.180\n like for example, for people like me,\n\n1:40:07.180 --> 1:40:09.580\n who are just like amateur Judo people,\n\n1:40:09.580 --> 1:40:12.900\n like there's all kinds of ways to prevent this turn\n\n1:40:12.900 --> 1:40:15.540\n from happening, the gripping and just everything.\n\n1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:19.420\n How difficult is it at the highest level\n\n1:40:19.420 --> 1:40:21.780\n to get into this position?\n\n1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:23.960\n I mean, you make it look effortless often,\n\n1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:25.780\n but like to get to the position where you're\n\n1:40:25.780 --> 1:40:29.640\n from facing them to your back is to them.\n\n1:40:29.640 --> 1:40:30.940\n Is that like strategy?\n\n1:40:30.940 --> 1:40:32.060\n Is that timing?\n\n1:40:32.060 --> 1:40:32.900\n Is that?\n\n1:40:32.900 --> 1:40:34.180\n Timing.\n\n1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:35.000\n It's timing.\n\n1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:38.260\n It's like anything, like if I wanted to punch you\n\n1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:41.100\n in the face, like how hard is it to really do that\n\n1:40:41.100 --> 1:40:44.220\n if you know you can just play defense and block it?\n\n1:40:44.220 --> 1:40:46.260\n The trick is to get them to play defense\n\n1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:48.140\n to something that never happened.\n\n1:40:50.780 --> 1:40:52.520\n And then you go through like another way.\n\n1:40:52.520 --> 1:40:54.780\n And then you just go through what would technically\n\n1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:58.220\n be your first plan if you planned on them playing defense.\n\n1:40:58.220 --> 1:41:02.180\n So I set the stage from the very beginning for this to work.\n\n1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:07.300\n So then this, you're celebrating here,\n\n1:41:07.300 --> 1:41:11.660\n it's a huge sort of, once a big accomplishments,\n\n1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:14.980\n big relief to qualify for the Olympics.\n\n1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:16.740\n And then you go into the Olympics\n\n1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:19.440\n and this is where I first saw Judo.\n\n1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:21.940\n And I kind of thought of them as the same\n\n1:41:21.940 --> 1:41:23.160\n as Judo and Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:41:24.660 --> 1:41:26.440\n And I was really impressed by your performance\n\n1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:28.420\n in that Olympics.\n\n1:41:28.420 --> 1:41:30.580\n The footage nowhere to be found these days,\n\n1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:34.300\n but at that time I think you could still,\n\n1:41:34.300 --> 1:41:36.940\n you could watch it live on NBC Olympics\n\n1:41:36.940 --> 1:41:38.860\n or somewhere like that.\n\n1:41:38.860 --> 1:41:41.200\n And I remember watching several of your matches.\n\n1:41:41.200 --> 1:41:45.180\n One of them was the match against Ole Bischoff, the German.\n\n1:41:45.180 --> 1:41:47.100\n And I remember being, it'd be nice\n\n1:41:47.100 --> 1:41:49.400\n if you can talk to that match because I don't remember it.\n\n1:41:49.400 --> 1:41:53.240\n All I remember is being frustrated.\n\n1:41:53.240 --> 1:41:54.520\n Yep.\n\n1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:58.540\n By him not letting you play Judo.\n\n1:41:58.540 --> 1:41:59.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:03.460\n So obviously you faced him again four years later\n\n1:42:03.460 --> 1:42:05.500\n and there's a lot of frustration there as well.\n\n1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:09.180\n But I remember being extra frustrated in 2008.\n\n1:42:09.180 --> 1:42:10.300\n What was that match like?\n\n1:42:10.300 --> 1:42:12.900\n So he might've been number one in the world at the time\n\n1:42:12.900 --> 1:42:13.740\n or up there?\n\n1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:18.420\n He was up there for sure, especially going into 2008.\n\n1:42:18.420 --> 1:42:19.780\n He was really high up there.\n\n1:42:19.780 --> 1:42:20.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:20.620 --> 1:42:24.940\n And did he win gold at that Olympics?\n\n1:42:24.940 --> 1:42:25.780\n Yes.\n\n1:42:25.780 --> 1:42:26.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:27.440\n Because he silvered in London.\n\n1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:31.420\n It was the same Olympic final both in 2008 and London.\n\n1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:32.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:42:32.340 --> 1:42:35.660\n Okay, so you're facing him there.\n\n1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:36.720\n Were you intimidated?\n\n1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:37.560\n What was the strategy?\n\n1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:39.640\n Can you talk to that match?\n\n1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:43.860\n Because it kind of sets the stage for the rematch in 2012.\n\n1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:48.060\n Yeah, he was somebody that I had trained with in the past.\n\n1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:51.940\n And for some reason, when it comes to him and I,\n\n1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.520\n when we train together,\n\n1:42:55.680 --> 1:42:57.800\n it's more of a physical altercation\n\n1:42:57.800 --> 1:42:59.440\n than a Judo training session.\n\n1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:04.440\n It's just the coaches have had to break us up a few times.\n\n1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:06.920\n Or you guys get almost angry too?\n\n1:43:06.920 --> 1:43:07.740\n A little bit.\n\n1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:11.320\n It always goes farther than it should.\n\n1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:12.160\n We're friends.\n\n1:43:12.160 --> 1:43:13.560\n We say hello to each other.\n\n1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:15.480\n But for some reason, when we train together,\n\n1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:19.360\n there's something about him and me that just oil and water.\n\n1:43:19.360 --> 1:43:20.440\n I don't know what it is.\n\n1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:21.640\n Could it be also the gripping?\n\n1:43:21.640 --> 1:43:24.160\n Because he's a great gripping strategist.\n\n1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.320\n Does he frustrate you with certain kinds of grips\n\n1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:28.940\n and then you get pissed off and then you frustrate him?\n\n1:43:28.940 --> 1:43:30.080\n And then he gets pissed off\n\n1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:32.240\n and then before you know it, somebody's kicked somebody\n\n1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:34.760\n or punched somebody in the mouth or done something.\n\n1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:38.120\n Yeah, so one of the only evidences we have online\n\n1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:43.120\n of you fighting him is your foot in his groin area\n\n1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:46.600\n is the only thing we have from that Olympics.\n\n1:43:46.600 --> 1:43:47.720\n From 2008.\n\n1:43:47.720 --> 1:43:48.920\n From 2008, yeah.\n\n1:43:48.920 --> 1:43:52.680\n And to answer everybody's question, yes, it was deliberate.\n\n1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:53.940\n Now you can say this.\n\n1:43:53.940 --> 1:43:54.780\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:54.780 --> 1:43:57.560\n But yeah, I remember there being a lot of frustration.\n\n1:43:57.560 --> 1:43:59.920\n You're actually going for a lot of stuff\n\n1:43:59.920 --> 1:44:00.800\n like sacrifice throws.\n\n1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:01.920\n I mean, maybe you're not going\n\n1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:03.440\n for the highest scoring epons,\n\n1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:05.280\n but you're just trying to shake things up,\n\n1:44:05.280 --> 1:44:06.460\n if I remember correctly.\n\n1:44:06.460 --> 1:44:09.880\n Yeah, because when he, I was so young then that,\n\n1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:13.120\n and he was in his prime really at that time, right?\n\n1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:18.120\n He must've been 24, 25, 26,\n\n1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:22.280\n world medalist, European champion at the time.\n\n1:44:22.280 --> 1:44:24.380\n And when he would grab me,\n\n1:44:24.380 --> 1:44:27.460\n I had that sense of feeling stuck.\n\n1:44:27.460 --> 1:44:30.280\n Like I was strong enough if I used all my strength\n\n1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:32.200\n to not let him do anything,\n\n1:44:32.200 --> 1:44:33.600\n but then you can't be offensive\n\n1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:34.840\n when you're using all your strength\n\n1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:38.000\n to hold onto the situation.\n\n1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:39.880\n So I was getting really aggravated\n\n1:44:39.880 --> 1:44:43.320\n because I couldn't generate any offense\n\n1:44:43.320 --> 1:44:45.640\n with every time I felt like I gained an advantage\n\n1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:47.200\n in the gripping scenario,\n\n1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:50.940\n he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like,\n\n1:44:50.940 --> 1:44:52.640\n well, now I've got to go address this thing,\n\n1:44:52.640 --> 1:44:54.820\n give up what I gained and I have to go back.\n\n1:44:54.820 --> 1:44:59.520\n And if I were to think about watching the match now,\n\n1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:01.720\n it probably looked like a lot of flailing\n\n1:45:01.720 --> 1:45:04.440\n because we're just trying to generate enough\n\n1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:05.960\n to not get a penalty,\n\n1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:08.780\n but also not enough to where he could counter it.\n\n1:45:10.080 --> 1:45:11.840\n Did you think you could beat him\n\n1:45:11.840 --> 1:45:14.200\n like when you were walking into the match?\n\n1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.000\n Until I gripped him for the first time,\n\n1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:19.120\n like, cause I had trained with him before,\n\n1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:21.940\n he felt stronger and more in shape\n\n1:45:21.940 --> 1:45:24.640\n than I've ever felt him that day.\n\n1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:29.640\n At that Olympics, which begs a whole nother question.\n\n1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:35.360\n But I remember when he grabbed me for that first time,\n\n1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:39.620\n I went, this is different.\n\n1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:42.760\n And there was a sense of panic at the time\n\n1:45:42.760 --> 1:45:45.960\n cause I was like, holy crap, where did this come from?\n\n1:45:45.960 --> 1:45:49.960\n This is not the guy that I've trained with that I expected.\n\n1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:53.880\n Cause it was a definite like level change\n\n1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:57.680\n in like his ability, strength, speed, and stamina.\n\n1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:00.360\n Like looking back at that, can you explain that?\n\n1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:04.280\n Is it just you being more, less confident\n\n1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:05.480\n because it was the Olympics?\n\n1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:08.560\n It was, is there some kind of routine that he followed\n\n1:46:08.560 --> 1:46:10.840\n to like really level up in intensity\n\n1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:12.200\n for this particular event?\n\n1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:17.160\n I've been told that he only gets to like his prime\n\n1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:20.320\n for like really big events.\n\n1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:23.920\n Like he doesn't train like year round like I would train,\n\n1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:25.440\n but when it comes to like the games,\n\n1:46:25.440 --> 1:46:29.040\n he doesn't do social media, he doesn't work,\n\n1:46:29.040 --> 1:46:33.400\n he lives, breathes, eats his training for the games,\n\n1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:36.500\n which could institute that level.\n\n1:46:36.500 --> 1:46:37.680\n What about you?\n\n1:46:37.680 --> 1:46:40.480\n Is there a, like Dan Gable famously said,\n\n1:46:40.480 --> 1:46:42.480\n like the one loss he had in college,\n\n1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:44.120\n he was doing a lot of media and stuff.\n\n1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:46.320\n Back then there was no social media.\n\n1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:48.560\n That was a huge mistake for him.\n\n1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:51.160\n Do you do social media, do you do like?\n\n1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:52.480\n At that, at this point?\n\n1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:53.720\n Well, at that time it was like AOL.\n\n1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:55.000\n I don't know, what's 2008?\n\n1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:58.240\n I didn't even have a Facebook page, a MySpace,\n\n1:46:58.240 --> 1:46:59.600\n nothing at this point.\n\n1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:04.240\n I got my first Facebook page from the USOC in 2012.\n\n1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:05.400\n When I went through the media thing,\n\n1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:07.680\n the lady was like, you have to have it.\n\n1:47:07.680 --> 1:47:08.960\n I go, I don't want it.\n\n1:47:08.960 --> 1:47:09.960\n I don't like people.\n\n1:47:09.960 --> 1:47:11.960\n I want to deal with the people.\n\n1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:13.200\n What am I supposed to do?\n\n1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:15.280\n You know, like the social part of the social media.\n\n1:47:15.280 --> 1:47:16.120\n No.\n\n1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:17.920\n Okay.\n\n1:47:17.920 --> 1:47:20.320\n I have to bring this up because,\n\n1:47:20.320 --> 1:47:22.800\n and then you went on to face Tiago Camilo.\n\n1:47:22.800 --> 1:47:24.920\n You lost that match, but he went on to win bronze.\n\n1:47:24.920 --> 1:47:27.480\n That's also an interesting one, but we can skip ahead.\n\n1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:29.000\n I just remember being really impressed\n\n1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:30.440\n both by your groundwork.\n\n1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:33.280\n That was a match I should have won.\n\n1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:34.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:34.960\n I should have won that.\n\n1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:38.480\n I was, if you don't know judo,\n\n1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:40.880\n you would visually watch that and be like, I'm winning.\n\n1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:43.240\n But he was technically winning on the scoreboard.\n\n1:47:43.240 --> 1:47:44.760\n So it is what it is.\n\n1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:47.520\n But the point that he got that solidified his win,\n\n1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:51.800\n yes, it was a point back in those days.\n\n1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:55.240\n So I can't say anything, but like my shoulder\n\n1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:56.840\n nicked the ground.\n\n1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.400\n So it's like, I don't know.\n\n1:47:58.400 --> 1:48:01.560\n Yeah. A lot of the stories of your Olympic career\n\n1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:04.680\n is like from a fan perspective,\n\n1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:06.720\n it seems like you should have won\n\n1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:09.080\n or you very close to could have won.\n\n1:48:09.080 --> 1:48:09.920\n Yes.\n\n1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:11.280\n And there was a lot of frustration in you\n\n1:48:11.280 --> 1:48:14.120\n and your game being like shut down in certain ways.\n\n1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:19.120\n But like the thing that immediately grabbed me in 2008\n\n1:48:19.160 --> 1:48:22.960\n was how much, something about the way you approached judo,\n\n1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:24.880\n how much you wanted to win.\n\n1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:26.440\n Cause I was young then.\n\n1:48:26.440 --> 1:48:31.000\n I was, when I was at this time of my career,\n\n1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.040\n I was out to like win.\n\n1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:36.320\n Like there was no like, I'm going to grab you,\n\n1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:37.160\n I'm going to throw you.\n\n1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:40.240\n And if not, you're going to go through a battle.\n\n1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:41.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:42.640\n You're going to make sure you earned it.\n\n1:48:42.640 --> 1:48:46.120\n It so happened that you competing in 2008,\n\n1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:51.240\n I was, I became a fan of yours at that moment.\n\n1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:55.040\n And since then, I kind of knew about judo.\n\n1:48:55.040 --> 1:48:57.640\n My university had a judo club\n\n1:48:57.640 --> 1:49:01.800\n and I kind of knew about jujitsu from mixed martial arts.\n\n1:49:01.800 --> 1:49:04.280\n And obviously I wrestled for many years before\n\n1:49:04.280 --> 1:49:06.000\n and I love wrestling,\n\n1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:09.960\n but there's something about you competing that made me,\n\n1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:11.080\n well, there's no other way to say it,\n\n1:49:11.080 --> 1:49:12.680\n but it like changed the direction of my life.\n\n1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:15.360\n Cause it forced me to say, you know what?\n\n1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:18.040\n I'm going to start judo and jujitsu.\n\n1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:20.800\n And first of all, for that, I'm really grateful,\n\n1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:22.120\n but it's fascinating to think,\n\n1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:24.200\n because this kid who's 22 years old,\n\n1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.680\n I'm sure I'm not the only one that you've influenced,\n\n1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:30.080\n like you've changed the direction of my life.\n\n1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:33.600\n And there could be huge number of others like that.\n\n1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:36.520\n I mean, that's the power of you as an individual\n\n1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:38.760\n at the, on the Olympic stage.\n\n1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:40.200\n You ever think about the pressure of that?\n\n1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:42.640\n Did you, did you think as a 22 year old,\n\n1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:44.480\n there's a bunch of people,\n\n1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:46.680\n like I know I'm not the only one who changed.\n\n1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:50.440\n I just happened to have like a microphone recently.\n\n1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:51.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:49:51.280 --> 1:49:54.520\n Like, is that, it's fascinating to think about, right?\n\n1:49:54.520 --> 1:49:57.280\n Like you, perhaps you didn't think about this.\n\n1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.400\n It's just, it's just a judo match,\n\n1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:02.600\n but you like, you influenced hundreds of thousands of people\n\n1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:03.440\n if not millions.\n\n1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:04.800\n Is that interesting?\n\n1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:09.640\n It's, it's not something that really hit me\n\n1:50:09.640 --> 1:50:14.640\n until 2012 when I lost,\n\n1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:18.880\n because that's when like,\n\n1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:25.520\n I would say like the world felt bad for me at that point.\n\n1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:30.520\n And that's when you knew that like people were watching\n\n1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.080\n and people were inspired by the loss\n\n1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.240\n because of how much went into that match.\n\n1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:41.080\n Because, you know, the 99% of us who watched it\n\n1:50:41.080 --> 1:50:44.520\n thought I won, except for the 1% of the people\n\n1:50:44.520 --> 1:50:48.280\n who were considered judges at that day in the event.\n\n1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:49.200\n So.\n\n1:50:49.200 --> 1:50:52.240\n But I mean, that's the, the win or lose,\n\n1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:54.200\n that, that was a really inspiring match.\n\n1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:57.040\n And that's when it, that's when it dinged that like,\n\n1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:00.680\n because I don't, I don't watch something\n\n1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:05.160\n and really get inspired by like the person and the act.\n\n1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:07.400\n It's like a, it's an accumulative thing.\n\n1:51:08.440 --> 1:51:12.080\n But for a lot of people, like when they watch\n\n1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:13.840\n how much goes into it,\n\n1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:16.040\n and then when I broke down on the match,\n\n1:51:16.040 --> 1:51:18.800\n like the amount of suffering that happens\n\n1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:20.320\n when you lose a match like that.\n\n1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:25.320\n And then, you know, really coming back and winning in Rio,\n\n1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:29.200\n there's a trend of people who were inspired\n\n1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:30.920\n that knew about London.\n\n1:51:30.920 --> 1:51:33.520\n And then when they found out I won in Rio,\n\n1:51:33.520 --> 1:51:36.920\n that's when like people like in droves felt like\n\n1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:39.440\n they could overcome their own personal obstacles\n\n1:51:39.440 --> 1:51:41.440\n to still achieve something\n\n1:51:41.440 --> 1:51:44.160\n because they've witnessed somebody who's fallen\n\n1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:45.280\n and gotten back up.\n\n1:51:46.440 --> 1:51:47.280\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:51.520\n But it's not something that you think about like on the day.\n\n1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:55.920\n It's when you look back and you go, oh, cause and effect.\n\n1:51:55.920 --> 1:51:57.680\n I wonder if you can comment on that.\n\n1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:01.760\n I'm trying to realize and live up to the fact\n\n1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:05.680\n that there's like young people that come up to me\n\n1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:09.240\n and I'm starting to realize like certain words I say\n\n1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:11.400\n will have a long lasting impact on them.\n\n1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:12.240\n Yep.\n\n1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:14.560\n Cause you say it as like, you don't even,\n\n1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:16.560\n it doesn't just, the whim.\n\n1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:19.320\n Some of them might come back 30 years later\n\n1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:22.800\n and a word I said was the reason they quit a thing\n\n1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:24.640\n and started the new thing that led them\n\n1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:27.880\n to become their true self, like to find success,\n\n1:52:27.880 --> 1:52:29.200\n all that kind of stuff like.\n\n1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:32.600\n On the flip side though, some people based on the actions\n\n1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:35.720\n that we do today, even with this cast\n\n1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:40.120\n will alter the course of their lives forever.\n\n1:52:40.120 --> 1:52:44.840\n I had a guy one time, was it after London?\n\n1:52:44.840 --> 1:52:46.920\n It must've been after London.\n\n1:52:46.920 --> 1:52:50.160\n He actually found me on Instagram,\n\n1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:53.920\n wrote me what seemed to be like a dissertation on Instagram\n\n1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:58.800\n about how much I disrespected him\n\n1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:03.320\n 14 years earlier because I didn't step on a podium\n\n1:53:03.320 --> 1:53:05.280\n to take a picture after winning a tournament\n\n1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:06.920\n where he bronzed.\n\n1:53:06.920 --> 1:53:07.760\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:11.640\n And I'm thinking to myself, like at the time,\n\n1:53:11.640 --> 1:53:14.160\n like having dinner with my family\n\n1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:15.760\n because I had to leave the next morning\n\n1:53:15.760 --> 1:53:18.600\n was more important to me as a person,\n\n1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:23.600\n not thinking about who you potentially will become\n\n1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:28.600\n and the actions of whatever you do today,\n\n1:53:29.560 --> 1:53:32.160\n if you do become quote unquote famous\n\n1:53:32.160 --> 1:53:34.280\n or somebody in a spotlight,\n\n1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:36.520\n that that could come back to bite you.\n\n1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:37.600\n To me, I don't know about you,\n\n1:53:37.600 --> 1:53:40.520\n that's super motivating,\n\n1:53:40.520 --> 1:53:45.520\n like not to be a lesser version of myself ever.\n\n1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:47.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:49.280\n Just be on top of your game, whatever that game is,\n\n1:53:49.280 --> 1:53:51.360\n be on top of your game when you interacting with people\n\n1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:53.920\n and when you're just in your own private life.\n\n1:53:53.920 --> 1:53:54.760\n I'm trying to make sure\n\n1:53:54.760 --> 1:53:56.560\n that I'm the exactly same person privately\n\n1:53:56.560 --> 1:54:00.160\n as I am publicly and like making sure I'm on point.\n\n1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:03.560\n I see like just hanging out with Joe Rogan a lot.\n\n1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:06.720\n I see how he's, first of all, the exact same person.\n\n1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:10.080\n And second, he like walks around\n\n1:54:10.080 --> 1:54:11.720\n and there's like a huge number of fans\n\n1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:14.840\n and you'll just take pictures and like, it's very cool.\n\n1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:17.440\n And it's very cognizant of like certain words he says,\n\n1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:20.200\n especially young people, like they're going to take that.\n\n1:54:20.200 --> 1:54:21.920\n And that's going to be a memory for them\n\n1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:24.240\n for a couple of years that might be influential\n\n1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:25.120\n for the rest of their life.\n\n1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:28.440\n So I don't know, that's a cool responsibility,\n\n1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:31.640\n not to fuck it up.\n\n1:54:31.640 --> 1:54:36.160\n But anyway, I bring all that up to just say, thank you.\n\n1:54:38.360 --> 1:54:40.200\n So even if you like were frustrated\n\n1:54:40.200 --> 1:54:41.560\n that you didn't win a medal,\n\n1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:46.560\n at least you influenced one silly Russian kid\n\n1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:48.160\n to get into the martial arts.\n\n1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:50.080\n And what happens when you get into martial arts,\n\n1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:52.000\n it alters the direction of your life.\n\n1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.640\n Mine for the better.\n\n1:54:54.640 --> 1:54:59.640\n Okay, so let's go to London 2012 Olympics.\n\n1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:05.240\n One of the most dramatic judo battles of all time rematch.\n\n1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:10.600\n So you've reached the semifinals once again\n\n1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:13.040\n to face the German, Ole Bischoff.\n\n1:55:14.360 --> 1:55:16.800\n Do you mind if we step through that match a little bit?\n\n1:55:16.800 --> 1:55:19.560\n Yeah, by all means.\n\n1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:23.160\n I've only ever watched the entire thing one time\n\n1:55:23.160 --> 1:55:27.760\n just because, fucking.\n\n1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:31.960\n So for context, for the listener,\n\n1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:36.320\n Travis, first of all, you don't like losing.\n\n1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:38.640\n I think that's fair to say.\n\n1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:41.680\n You know, the hard part with this match\n\n1:55:41.680 --> 1:55:45.360\n is because I went into this Olympics thinking,\n\n1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:47.240\n I'm gonna fucking win the Olympics.\n\n1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:48.520\n I'm the best in the world.\n\n1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.400\n I never in my right mind thought,\n\n1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.880\n oh, I'm gonna win a medal.\n\n1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.200\n Like that never crossed my mind.\n\n1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:06.200\n So it's like, I would have rather him just fucking beat me.\n\n1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:11.080\n Because then I lost.\n\n1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:15.480\n So here the referees, as many people thought,\n\n1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:16.920\n robbed you of a victory,\n\n1:56:16.920 --> 1:56:18.600\n but it was also a really close battle.\n\n1:56:18.600 --> 1:56:22.880\n Again, with many of the elements of frustration as 2008\n\n1:56:22.880 --> 1:56:25.360\n in terms of strategically and gripping wise.\n\n1:56:25.360 --> 1:56:28.720\n And it was just a fascinating battle that went to overtime.\n\n1:56:28.720 --> 1:56:30.760\n So can you set the context?\n\n1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:33.400\n So what did the bracket look like?\n\n1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:35.000\n Who were the players here?\n\n1:56:35.960 --> 1:56:38.720\n Who did you beat leading up to this match?\n\n1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:43.640\n As you walk onto the mat, what happened the hours before?\n\n1:56:43.640 --> 1:56:44.960\n As you're standing there.\n\n1:56:44.960 --> 1:56:48.560\n How bad is it when two people are standing like this?\n\n1:56:48.560 --> 1:56:50.160\n And yeah.\n\n1:56:50.160 --> 1:56:51.320\n That fucking guy, man.\n\n1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:57.360\n But this bracket was really interesting\n\n1:56:57.360 --> 1:57:00.360\n if you look at like the backstory of 81 kilos,\n\n1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:03.000\n like leading up to the Olympics, right?\n\n1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.760\n Because at this point in time,\n\n1:57:05.760 --> 1:57:09.960\n I was inside the top 10 at all times,\n\n1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:14.160\n eight, seven, five, four, sixes.\n\n1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:16.040\n I fell out of there sometimes due to injuries,\n\n1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:17.480\n but I always climbed back in.\n\n1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:23.480\n There was another guy from Azerbaijan\n\n1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:27.280\n that was the Olympic champion at 73 kilos in 2008.\n\n1:57:28.280 --> 1:57:33.280\n And the entire division got rocked by match one\n\n1:57:33.280 --> 1:57:38.280\n because his first match was with Antoine Valus Fortier\n\n1:57:39.400 --> 1:57:40.240\n of Canada.\n\n1:57:41.320 --> 1:57:45.520\n And everybody who saw the draw come out was like,\n\n1:57:45.520 --> 1:57:47.680\n the Azerbaijanis gonna win it.\n\n1:57:47.680 --> 1:57:49.840\n He's the former Olympic champion.\n\n1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:52.400\n He's pretty much won most of the major events,\n\n1:57:52.400 --> 1:57:55.480\n including at 90 kilos, because he just had smooth judo.\n\n1:57:56.920 --> 1:58:01.920\n And match one rolls around, match two rolls around.\n\n1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:05.240\n Antoine's in the shoot and he's looking around\n\n1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:09.040\n and he's like, the Azerbaijanis not here.\n\n1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:10.640\n Well, where is he?\n\n1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:15.640\n No joke, he runs into the venue a match before,\n\n1:58:16.400 --> 1:58:19.560\n throws his gi on and runs onto the Olympic platform.\n\n1:58:20.760 --> 1:58:22.160\n Loses to the Canadian\n\n1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:24.720\n in like a three minute golden score battle.\n\n1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:28.400\n So do you think he warmed up?\n\n1:58:28.400 --> 1:58:29.320\n Didn't, he ran.\n\n1:58:29.320 --> 1:58:31.880\n He literally ran into the venue,\n\n1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:34.560\n threw his gi on and ran out, did no judo.\n\n1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:39.080\n And there you see Antoine losing in the quarters.\n\n1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:42.840\n So how good was Antoine?\n\n1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:45.200\n At this point in time, this is,\n\n1:58:45.200 --> 1:58:48.400\n I believe his first international medal\n\n1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:49.560\n was the Olympic games.\n\n1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:53.960\n So I don't think he'd ever meddled in Paris.\n\n1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:57.200\n He went into this bracket unranked,\n\n1:58:57.200 --> 1:59:00.840\n beating the ranked guy first round because he,\n\n1:59:00.840 --> 1:59:02.960\n I don't know if he missed the bus.\n\n1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:06.800\n I don't know if he was off his cycle and planned on losing\n\n1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:08.360\n cause he didn't want to test positive.\n\n1:59:08.360 --> 1:59:09.600\n I don't know.\n\n1:59:09.600 --> 1:59:12.800\n There's a lot of like questionable things out there\n\n1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:15.960\n that could have potentially caused him to,\n\n1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:20.640\n run onto the Olympic platform for match one.\n\n1:59:21.720 --> 1:59:26.720\n But it catapulted Antoine into like a belief\n\n1:59:26.720 --> 1:59:31.720\n that like, I beat the seated guy, I'm ready.\n\n1:59:31.960 --> 1:59:34.560\n And that was like a turning point in the Canadian's career\n\n1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:37.560\n just as a whole, right?\n\n1:59:37.560 --> 1:59:40.960\n That's that everybody has a defining moment.\n\n1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:45.040\n Like mine was when I beat Bischoff in Dusseldorf\n\n1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:49.800\n at the grand prix for Germany after 2008, right?\n\n1:59:49.800 --> 1:59:53.240\n I beat the Olympic champion in, on his home soil\n\n1:59:53.240 --> 1:59:55.480\n to go win the entire tournament.\n\n1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:57.960\n So we all have like those moments.\n\n1:59:57.960 --> 2:00:00.120\n It's just when it happens at the games,\n\n2:00:00.120 --> 2:00:02.920\n it throws the bracket like into a tailspin.\n\n2:00:02.920 --> 2:00:05.640\n Cause typically you'd know like who's going to beat who,\n\n2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:07.680\n where it's going to happen.\n\n2:00:07.680 --> 2:00:11.640\n And when you look at my quarter final against the Brazilian,\n\n2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:14.120\n what most people don't know is I was,\n\n2:00:14.120 --> 2:00:16.480\n I was so thankful I had that match.\n\n2:00:16.480 --> 2:00:19.920\n Most people would never in a million years be like,\n\n2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:22.280\n I want to fight the world number one at the Olympic games.\n\n2:00:22.280 --> 2:00:23.680\n That's what I want to do.\n\n2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:25.880\n I want to be the eighth seed fighting the world number one\n\n2:00:25.880 --> 2:00:26.920\n cause I'm going to win.\n\n2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:29.800\n I was pissed off at him.\n\n2:00:29.800 --> 2:00:34.080\n I was so angry because we,\n\n2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:37.800\n we were at the Pan Am's I think the year before\n\n2:00:37.800 --> 2:00:40.300\n and there was a team tournament and I wanted to fight him.\n\n2:00:40.300 --> 2:00:45.300\n I had lost the quarters to a Cuban, I think.\n\n2:00:46.240 --> 2:00:47.880\n In like the first gripping exchange,\n\n2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:50.280\n he threw me with a drop sale out of nowhere.\n\n2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:51.400\n I was pissed.\n\n2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:55.040\n So I wanted my hands on the Brazilian and the team match.\n\n2:00:55.040 --> 2:00:57.600\n Well, the Brazilian team is warming up.\n\n2:00:57.600 --> 2:00:59.080\n So I walk up to him, no joke.\n\n2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:01.520\n I walked up to him and I go, you're fighting.\n\n2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:03.780\n And he goes, not today.\n\n2:01:03.780 --> 2:01:06.140\n And I went, are you fucking kidding me?\n\n2:01:06.140 --> 2:01:06.980\n I warmed up.\n\n2:01:06.980 --> 2:01:09.440\n I taped up that you're the only fucking guy I want to fight\n\n2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:10.680\n and you're going to fucking sit in the stands\n\n2:01:10.680 --> 2:01:12.680\n and read a goddamn book.\n\n2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:13.680\n I was so angry.\n\n2:01:13.680 --> 2:01:17.120\n I carried that anger cause I never fought him until this day.\n\n2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:18.240\n I was fucking pissed.\n\n2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:19.780\n I was ready to beat him.\n\n2:01:19.780 --> 2:01:23.500\n That's right, I forgot he was the world number one.\n\n2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:27.680\n Cause I remember being really excited at that match.\n\n2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:28.720\n How did you beat him?\n\n2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:31.880\n I threw him with two hands on the same side, collar,\n\n2:01:31.880 --> 2:01:32.720\n like drop sale.\n\n2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:35.640\n I cross gripped, I yanked him behind me and I threw him.\n\n2:01:35.640 --> 2:01:36.480\n Epon?\n\n2:01:36.480 --> 2:01:37.300\n Wazari.\n\n2:01:37.300 --> 2:01:40.560\n And then the match ended 30 seconds later.\n\n2:01:41.620 --> 2:01:42.820\n I was pumped.\n\n2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:43.660\n So fucking angry.\n\n2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:46.320\n I thought, okay, if I'm remembering correctly,\n\n2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:49.900\n I thought, okay, this guy might actually win gold.\n\n2:01:51.900 --> 2:01:55.160\n That's what made, for me as a spectator,\n\n2:01:55.160 --> 2:02:00.160\n remembering now the next match that much more like painful.\n\n2:02:00.440 --> 2:02:04.580\n And then the fans of judo that really followed the sport,\n\n2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:08.680\n the stats, when you look at the games and my draws,\n\n2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:09.760\n I had the worst possible draw\n\n2:02:09.760 --> 2:02:11.560\n as you ever could have imagined.\n\n2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:15.120\n At both London and Rio, I fought the world number one\n\n2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:19.100\n to get to the final or into the semis or past the semis.\n\n2:02:19.100 --> 2:02:22.420\n And everybody I fought in the draw\n\n2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:24.640\n either beat me the last time we fought\n\n2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:27.000\n or I had never fought before.\n\n2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:29.320\n So I always held a loss going onto the mat\n\n2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:30.240\n at the Olympic games.\n\n2:02:30.240 --> 2:02:31.600\n How'd you feel about that, by the way?\n\n2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:32.920\n Like what were your feelings\n\n2:02:32.920 --> 2:02:35.360\n about facing the Brazilian first?\n\n2:02:35.360 --> 2:02:36.560\n I was so excited.\n\n2:02:36.560 --> 2:02:38.860\n Well, that was match three.\n\n2:02:38.860 --> 2:02:41.360\n In London, I fought the Slovenian guy first round\n\n2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:42.380\n who beat me.\n\n2:02:44.220 --> 2:02:45.060\n Where'd he beat me?\n\n2:02:45.060 --> 2:02:46.280\n Was it the Worlds?\n\n2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:47.640\n Might've been the Worlds.\n\n2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:50.400\n And then, Church's Ville, I fought in the second round\n\n2:02:50.400 --> 2:02:54.800\n who threw me for Wazari in Japan.\n\n2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:58.160\n And then, Leandro, who I don't think I ever fought,\n\n2:02:58.160 --> 2:02:59.400\n who was world number one.\n\n2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:02.240\n That avoided fighting me at the team tournament.\n\n2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:04.720\n But I mean, every single Olympics you've fought\n\n2:03:04.720 --> 2:03:06.040\n and you really stepped up.\n\n2:03:06.040 --> 2:03:09.040\n It's the only tournament I've ever prepped for.\n\n2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:11.100\n Mentally and physically and just the whole thing?\n\n2:03:11.100 --> 2:03:11.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:14.280\n We never trained through this tournament\n\n2:03:14.280 --> 2:03:15.520\n like we did for the others.\n\n2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:18.480\n Or I would go into it injured.\n\n2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:19.400\n All right, well, let's talk about,\n\n2:03:19.400 --> 2:03:24.120\n you're standing there next to the German.\n\n2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:26.360\n He looked always smaller than you,\n\n2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:28.260\n but you said like strong.\n\n2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:29.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:33.720\n So what are you feeling now, Jimmy Pedro behind you?\n\n2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:35.520\n I was fucking ready to take his head off.\n\n2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:38.920\n Did you have an idea of what you're gonna do?\n\n2:03:38.920 --> 2:03:41.800\n Did you try to, do you're thinking of winning by Ypon?\n\n2:03:41.800 --> 2:03:44.040\n Were you thinking like going for big throws,\n\n2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:47.280\n or take him in deep waters, outgrip him?\n\n2:03:47.280 --> 2:03:48.160\n What were you thinking?\n\n2:03:48.160 --> 2:03:50.120\n We were about to have a battle\n\n2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:54.040\n and I wasn't gonna throw him until he broke mentally.\n\n2:03:55.160 --> 2:03:56.280\n Okay.\n\n2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:59.180\n That was, there was no like,\n\n2:03:59.180 --> 2:04:00.980\n oh, this is gonna be a clean throw.\n\n2:04:00.980 --> 2:04:04.180\n That was never, that was never the thought process.\n\n2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:10.720\n So here, you know there's going to be a lot of gripping.\n\n2:04:10.720 --> 2:04:14.080\n So we're seeing a shit ton of gripping.\n\n2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:18.480\n And right here, he throws it, bang, close fisted.\n\n2:04:20.100 --> 2:04:21.740\n You got a lot of adrenaline.\n\n2:04:21.740 --> 2:04:22.580\n You seem calm.\n\n2:04:22.580 --> 2:04:23.420\n I'm pissed.\n\n2:04:23.420 --> 2:04:24.260\n You're pissed.\n\n2:04:24.260 --> 2:04:26.180\n Like, you don't look serious, you just look like.\n\n2:04:26.180 --> 2:04:27.780\n I'm looking at the ref like,\n\n2:04:27.780 --> 2:04:28.700\n cause he keeps telling me to get up.\n\n2:04:28.700 --> 2:04:30.900\n I'm like, I have blood running down my face.\n\n2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:33.180\n I go.\n\n2:04:33.180 --> 2:04:34.680\n Okay.\n\n2:04:34.680 --> 2:04:36.140\n Here, there's blood.\n\n2:04:36.140 --> 2:04:37.980\n See, and he's like, oh yeah, go fix it.\n\n2:04:37.980 --> 2:04:39.980\n And that's on your eyebrow somewhere?\n\n2:04:39.980 --> 2:04:42.260\n Yeah, he split it just underneath it.\n\n2:04:42.260 --> 2:04:43.380\n So you split your eyebrow.\n\n2:04:43.380 --> 2:04:46.820\n And so in judo, they don't, they're allergic to blood,\n\n2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:47.900\n probably for a good reason.\n\n2:04:47.900 --> 2:04:51.180\n But they, so now you have to try to figure out\n\n2:04:51.180 --> 2:04:53.420\n how to tape that up.\n\n2:04:53.420 --> 2:04:54.300\n Yep.\n\n2:04:54.300 --> 2:04:56.980\n Which already sets up one of the most bad ass\n\n2:04:58.140 --> 2:04:59.780\n looks in judo history.\n\n2:05:00.660 --> 2:05:04.140\n First 15 seconds, busted my eye open.\n\n2:05:04.140 --> 2:05:06.380\n Was that getting in the way of your eyesight at all or no?\n\n2:05:06.380 --> 2:05:07.220\n No.\n\n2:05:07.220 --> 2:05:10.740\n Damn, he looks good at gripping.\n\n2:05:10.740 --> 2:05:12.940\n How difficult is it to get a grip on that guy?\n\n2:05:12.940 --> 2:05:13.780\n Very.\n\n2:05:14.740 --> 2:05:16.660\n Like I'm struggling just to get my hand in the collar\n\n2:05:16.660 --> 2:05:18.220\n and he wasn't even blocking it.\n\n2:05:18.220 --> 2:05:19.820\n Is he being cagey?\n\n2:05:19.820 --> 2:05:22.540\n Remember like, is he interested in offense?\n\n2:05:22.540 --> 2:05:23.380\n Nope.\n\n2:05:23.380 --> 2:05:27.300\n He's a very cagey, you know, methodical player.\n\n2:05:27.300 --> 2:05:30.300\n Like he, he never opens himself up.\n\n2:05:30.300 --> 2:05:31.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:31.900 --> 2:05:32.740\n There you go.\n\n2:05:32.740 --> 2:05:34.500\n You grabbed the leg as part of a combination.\n\n2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:35.340\n Yep.\n\n2:05:35.340 --> 2:05:38.740\n And people have told me that he's actually very good\n\n2:05:38.740 --> 2:05:39.820\n at throwing people.\n\n2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:41.220\n He just doesn't.\n\n2:05:41.220 --> 2:05:43.380\n So, but he just doesn't show it at these.\n\n2:05:43.380 --> 2:05:44.220\n Nope.\n\n2:05:44.220 --> 2:05:46.660\n Cause he, he doesn't care how he wins.\n\n2:05:46.660 --> 2:05:48.340\n He cares that he wins.\n\n2:05:48.340 --> 2:05:49.180\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:49.180 --> 2:05:51.060\n Which makes him very difficult to beat.\n\n2:05:51.940 --> 2:05:55.340\n Cause he knows when you've strategized to do that,\n\n2:05:55.340 --> 2:05:57.740\n where you look at the rule set and you develop a plan\n\n2:05:57.740 --> 2:05:59.460\n to get through the matches,\n\n2:05:59.460 --> 2:06:01.940\n then you've really got to figure out a way\n\n2:06:01.940 --> 2:06:04.540\n to get that person off that game plan.\n\n2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:07.500\n You know, whether you get ahead by a penalty or something.\n\n2:06:08.740 --> 2:06:10.260\n Right there.\n\n2:06:10.260 --> 2:06:13.820\n Like, he wouldn't give me the sleeve,\n\n2:06:13.820 --> 2:06:15.860\n so I grabbed all of his fingers.\n\n2:06:15.860 --> 2:06:17.180\n Oh, nice.\n\n2:06:17.180 --> 2:06:21.220\n In which I open like, like this way or?\n\n2:06:21.220 --> 2:06:23.940\n I grabbed them the other way and I started lifting them.\n\n2:06:23.940 --> 2:06:24.780\n Ah, yeah.\n\n2:06:24.780 --> 2:06:25.620\n Like I start, nice.\n\n2:06:25.620 --> 2:06:26.460\n Oh, like perfect.\n\n2:06:26.460 --> 2:06:27.300\n Reverse play and mercy.\n\n2:06:27.300 --> 2:06:28.140\n Like this.\n\n2:06:28.140 --> 2:06:28.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:30.540\n Oh, this is great.\n\n2:06:30.540 --> 2:06:31.660\n Cause he wouldn't give me the sleeve\n\n2:06:31.660 --> 2:06:33.820\n and I needed an attack.\n\n2:06:33.820 --> 2:06:36.060\n And then I'm like, okay, I can't hold onto this forever\n\n2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:37.180\n cause that judge is going to see it.\n\n2:06:37.180 --> 2:06:38.700\n So let me just do a quick throw here\n\n2:06:38.700 --> 2:06:40.500\n while I'm using the fingers in the mercy grip.\n\n2:06:40.500 --> 2:06:41.580\n You're holding on.\n\n2:06:41.580 --> 2:06:42.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:42.420 --> 2:06:43.780\n And then I just sit out.\n\n2:06:43.780 --> 2:06:44.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:06:46.860 --> 2:06:49.740\n And then he goes to get up and I go to get on top\n\n2:06:49.740 --> 2:06:50.740\n and right here.\n\n2:06:51.580 --> 2:06:52.580\n Nice.\n\n2:06:52.580 --> 2:06:53.420\n That elbow.\n\n2:06:53.420 --> 2:06:54.260\n You get him?\n\n2:06:54.260 --> 2:06:55.100\n Oh, you got him.\n\n2:06:55.100 --> 2:06:57.340\n Yeah, it looks like I elbow him.\n\n2:06:57.340 --> 2:06:58.500\n Did you do it kind of?\n\n2:06:58.500 --> 2:07:00.020\n No, I didn't.\n\n2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:02.660\n At the time, I never knew this happened\n\n2:07:02.660 --> 2:07:06.220\n until after I watched this like three or four years later.\n\n2:07:06.220 --> 2:07:08.660\n Didn't even know, I didn't even feel it.\n\n2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:09.500\n Look at that.\n\n2:07:09.500 --> 2:07:10.940\n So he's legitimately angry here.\n\n2:07:10.940 --> 2:07:11.820\n Yeah, he's angry.\n\n2:07:13.220 --> 2:07:15.660\n And of course you can't, you can't move.\n\n2:07:15.660 --> 2:07:16.740\n Why would you move?\n\n2:07:16.740 --> 2:07:17.580\n Look at this.\n\n2:07:17.580 --> 2:07:19.100\n This moment right there is gold.\n\n2:07:19.100 --> 2:07:21.380\n If you're not watching this on video, you're missing out.\n\n2:07:21.380 --> 2:07:23.100\n You never get this in judo.\n\n2:07:23.100 --> 2:07:25.420\n No, I don't know if that's ever happened.\n\n2:07:25.420 --> 2:07:26.900\n That little face off.\n\n2:07:26.900 --> 2:07:29.100\n Especially on a stage like this.\n\n2:07:29.100 --> 2:07:30.260\n The reference.\n\n2:07:30.260 --> 2:07:32.180\n And then he brings us in to like talk to us\n\n2:07:32.180 --> 2:07:33.780\n and he's like, hey, we're good, right?\n\n2:07:33.780 --> 2:07:34.860\n Like, you guys aren't about to do\n\n2:07:34.860 --> 2:07:36.420\n what I think you're about to do.\n\n2:07:38.060 --> 2:07:39.900\n And he's like, hey, shake hands again.\n\n2:07:39.900 --> 2:07:41.860\n Cause the first time we did it, that wasn't good enough.\n\n2:07:41.860 --> 2:07:43.260\n Well, you gotta do it again.\n\n2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:47.380\n The heartbreaking part about this\n\n2:07:47.380 --> 2:07:51.260\n and why the IJF switched it to an unlimited golden score.\n\n2:07:51.260 --> 2:07:53.580\n Because we fought five minutes\n\n2:07:54.860 --> 2:07:57.660\n through the entire normal part of the match.\n\n2:07:57.660 --> 2:08:01.980\n And then we did the entire overtime period of three minutes.\n\n2:08:01.980 --> 2:08:04.340\n Not one penalty was given.\n\n2:08:04.340 --> 2:08:07.060\n No gripping infractions, no false attacks,\n\n2:08:07.060 --> 2:08:08.140\n like no stallings.\n\n2:08:08.140 --> 2:08:08.980\n That's great.\n\n2:08:08.980 --> 2:08:10.340\n Nobody was really backing up.\n\n2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:11.180\n Yep.\n\n2:08:11.180 --> 2:08:12.020\n I mean, he was, you know.\n\n2:08:12.020 --> 2:08:13.780\n So what was Jimmy telling you here?\n\n2:08:14.780 --> 2:08:16.500\n Or was he talking to you at all?\n\n2:08:16.500 --> 2:08:19.500\n He's not allowed to talk during medical things\n\n2:08:19.500 --> 2:08:21.860\n and my nose is now broken.\n\n2:08:21.860 --> 2:08:23.860\n But he's also, oh, the nose is broken.\n\n2:08:23.860 --> 2:08:25.060\n From what?\n\n2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:26.540\n I caught an elbow from him.\n\n2:08:28.340 --> 2:08:29.420\n Glad his face is clean.\n\n2:08:29.420 --> 2:08:30.900\n That's fun.\n\n2:08:30.900 --> 2:08:32.700\n And right here, I was pissed.\n\n2:08:32.700 --> 2:08:34.660\n I was so angry at the medic\n\n2:08:34.660 --> 2:08:36.420\n because he's fumbling around and I'm like,\n\n2:08:36.420 --> 2:08:40.180\n my whole plan is to break the German mentally.\n\n2:08:40.180 --> 2:08:42.380\n You gotta hurry up with the tape, man.\n\n2:08:42.380 --> 2:08:43.620\n He's supposed to be tired.\n\n2:08:43.620 --> 2:08:45.220\n He's not supposed to be resting.\n\n2:08:46.940 --> 2:08:48.220\n Is Jimmy yelling here?\n\n2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:49.340\n He can't.\n\n2:08:49.340 --> 2:08:52.380\n No, not here, not here, but during the match.\n\n2:08:52.380 --> 2:08:53.780\n And you can see I just take it from him\n\n2:08:53.780 --> 2:08:54.780\n and I'm like, give it to me.\n\n2:08:54.780 --> 2:08:55.740\n I'm gonna do it myself.\n\n2:08:55.740 --> 2:08:56.580\n Get out of here.\n\n2:08:58.380 --> 2:09:00.740\n How scared is the medic?\n\n2:09:00.740 --> 2:09:01.580\n He's like, this guy's gonna kill me.\n\n2:09:01.580 --> 2:09:03.220\n He can't even tear the tape.\n\n2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:04.500\n Look how nervous he is.\n\n2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:10.900\n We made fun of him for this so much throughout the years.\n\n2:09:10.900 --> 2:09:12.380\n Still do to this day.\n\n2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:13.300\n All right, here we go.\n\n2:09:13.300 --> 2:09:15.780\n Oh, you look great getting geared up.\n\n2:09:15.780 --> 2:09:17.820\n Can't really see, don't care.\n\n2:09:17.820 --> 2:09:19.780\n Was there some outcome in your mind\n\n2:09:19.780 --> 2:09:21.300\n that you could possibly beat him on the ground\n\n2:09:21.300 --> 2:09:22.620\n with a submission or a pin?\n\n2:09:22.620 --> 2:09:24.260\n You knew you were gonna have to throw him.\n\n2:09:24.260 --> 2:09:26.020\n I knew I was gonna have to.\n\n2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:29.020\n If I was gonna throw him or armbar him\n\n2:09:29.020 --> 2:09:31.860\n or pin him, whatever the case may be,\n\n2:09:31.860 --> 2:09:36.860\n it was gonna be his mental like, I'm just tired of this.\n\n2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:38.660\n He's too cagey of a player.\n\n2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:40.340\n He's too experienced.\n\n2:09:41.380 --> 2:09:44.780\n He has to mentally make that choice to give that inch.\n\n2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:47.140\n And then you just have to be ready to take it.\n\n2:09:47.140 --> 2:09:48.620\n So I was just waiting for it.\n\n2:09:50.140 --> 2:09:53.300\n And so now this is four minutes in, one minute left.\n\n2:09:53.300 --> 2:09:54.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:09:54.140 --> 2:09:57.700\n Oh, is that in your game plan two potentials\n\n2:09:57.700 --> 2:10:01.180\n like sumi gaeshi, like the sacrifice throws to him?\n\n2:10:01.180 --> 2:10:03.420\n Cause the whole point of that technique\n\n2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:04.940\n and the sacrifice throws wasn't\n\n2:10:04.940 --> 2:10:07.180\n because I thought I was gonna throw him,\n\n2:10:07.180 --> 2:10:10.060\n but it disrupts the pattern enough\n\n2:10:10.060 --> 2:10:14.100\n to like get him to make a potential mistake.\n\n2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:16.700\n Like see, he should have gotten Ashido there.\n\n2:10:16.700 --> 2:10:18.300\n Hands in the face.\n\n2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:20.220\n But again, that's just part of judo.\n\n2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:21.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:21.300 --> 2:10:22.620\n He poked me in the elbow.\n\n2:10:23.740 --> 2:10:25.340\n This is a rough match.\n\n2:10:25.340 --> 2:10:27.700\n Does he act at all or no?\n\n2:10:27.700 --> 2:10:30.060\n Like, was he acting frustrated or anything like that?\n\n2:10:30.060 --> 2:10:33.380\n It was all like, he's like acting for the ref.\n\n2:10:33.380 --> 2:10:34.220\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:10:34.220 --> 2:10:35.860\n Like, oh, that, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:10:35.860 --> 2:10:39.340\n You're just going in hard, nonstop,\n\n2:10:39.340 --> 2:10:43.620\n like angry, aggressive, feeling cardio here at all.\n\n2:10:43.620 --> 2:10:44.460\n Like.\n\n2:10:44.460 --> 2:10:46.940\n I don't, I didn't get tired during this.\n\n2:10:46.940 --> 2:10:48.700\n And then just always pressing for.\n\n2:10:48.700 --> 2:10:50.220\n Time runs out.\n\n2:10:50.220 --> 2:10:51.820\n Now we're into golden score.\n\n2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:54.580\n 12 minutes and 38 seconds later.\n\n2:10:54.580 --> 2:10:56.820\n Yeah, you think about every judo exchange, right?\n\n2:10:56.820 --> 2:10:59.300\n Every time we grip up, every time we attack,\n\n2:10:59.300 --> 2:11:01.380\n sometimes it can take longer to get back to the line\n\n2:11:01.380 --> 2:11:02.660\n than the entire exchange.\n\n2:11:02.660 --> 2:11:03.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:11:03.700 --> 2:11:06.100\n So the more aggression, the more exchanges you have,\n\n2:11:06.100 --> 2:11:09.580\n the longer the time stretches.\n\n2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:13.420\n Then here, the six seconds left in golden score,\n\n2:11:13.420 --> 2:11:18.420\n your tape is now yellow and red\n\n2:11:20.260 --> 2:11:23.220\n with sweat and blood, literally, and time is out.\n\n2:11:23.220 --> 2:11:24.340\n Now, what are you thinking here?\n\n2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:25.900\n Do you think you won the match?\n\n2:11:26.860 --> 2:11:29.460\n I thought I won the match a minute ago.\n\n2:11:30.900 --> 2:11:32.380\n I remember thinking to myself,\n\n2:11:32.380 --> 2:11:36.460\n like if this goes to the flags, I won.\n\n2:11:36.460 --> 2:11:37.540\n No doubt in my mind.\n\n2:11:39.500 --> 2:11:42.500\n Because I felt like the whole time,\n\n2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:45.260\n like I was going to him, right?\n\n2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:46.980\n He was never coming at me.\n\n2:11:47.940 --> 2:11:49.900\n Yeah, that's the way it felt.\n\n2:11:49.900 --> 2:11:52.940\n And like, that's the way it felt body language wise,\n\n2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:55.820\n just the intensity, how fast you're moving towards him.\n\n2:11:55.820 --> 2:11:57.540\n You're constantly going for throws.\n\n2:12:00.820 --> 2:12:02.300\n Now, if you want to rewind that,\n\n2:12:02.300 --> 2:12:03.660\n we can talk about the whole,\n\n2:12:03.660 --> 2:12:05.020\n because it's a part of this clip.\n\n2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:08.420\n So wait a minute, they all went blue.\n\n2:12:08.420 --> 2:12:09.260\n They all did.\n\n2:12:09.260 --> 2:12:12.140\n So in judo, there's three referees,\n\n2:12:12.140 --> 2:12:13.780\n two on the side, one in the center,\n\n2:12:13.780 --> 2:12:14.620\n and they all vote on who won.\n\n2:12:14.620 --> 2:12:16.180\n And now let's pause it right there.\n\n2:12:16.180 --> 2:12:18.260\n Now, the way this is supposed to work,\n\n2:12:18.260 --> 2:12:21.900\n they raise their flags, they do like a one, two count,\n\n2:12:21.900 --> 2:12:24.900\n and then on three, they all raise it together.\n\n2:12:24.900 --> 2:12:28.260\n Now, as a little pretext to this entire match,\n\n2:12:28.260 --> 2:12:32.420\n up until this point, not one match at the Olympic Games\n\n2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:34.820\n has ever been a split decision.\n\n2:12:34.820 --> 2:12:36.620\n Meaning out of three people,\n\n2:12:37.460 --> 2:12:40.380\n not one of them voted against the other group members.\n\n2:12:41.340 --> 2:12:44.580\n So they were all unified blue or all unified white.\n\n2:12:44.580 --> 2:12:45.420\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:45.420 --> 2:12:46.260\n Right?\n\n2:12:46.260 --> 2:12:49.260\n Which is statistically difficult to imagine.\n\n2:12:49.260 --> 2:12:50.660\n Yes.\n\n2:12:50.660 --> 2:12:53.940\n It's almost like they had a referee meeting and said,\n\n2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:55.740\n it's better for the Olympics.\n\n2:12:55.740 --> 2:12:56.980\n To never have a split.\n\n2:12:56.980 --> 2:12:58.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:58.260 --> 2:12:59.100\n Okay.\n\n2:13:00.020 --> 2:13:02.820\n So the question becomes,\n\n2:13:02.820 --> 2:13:07.060\n if you would click that frame by frame, right?\n\n2:13:08.100 --> 2:13:11.740\n So right now we have all the refs with their flags out\n\n2:13:11.740 --> 2:13:12.940\n and then click that.\n\n2:13:12.940 --> 2:13:15.340\n So the middle guy starts.\n\n2:13:15.340 --> 2:13:17.020\n He is all the way up.\n\n2:13:17.020 --> 2:13:17.860\n All the way up.\n\n2:13:17.860 --> 2:13:20.260\n The other side judges haven't moved.\n\n2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:23.620\n We now have one side ref all the way up.\n\n2:13:23.620 --> 2:13:26.620\n Then we have a third side ref all the way up.\n\n2:13:28.540 --> 2:13:29.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:29.380 --> 2:13:31.540\n So there's a time point\n\n2:13:31.540 --> 2:13:33.700\n when the middle guy has the flag all the way up.\n\n2:13:33.700 --> 2:13:35.860\n If not 80, 90% of the way there.\n\n2:13:35.860 --> 2:13:36.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:36.700 --> 2:13:37.860\n Then the other one does.\n\n2:13:37.860 --> 2:13:39.460\n And then the third one goes.\n\n2:13:40.460 --> 2:13:44.740\n So now the question becomes who really,\n\n2:13:44.740 --> 2:13:47.260\n like did the outside refs really have an opinion?\n\n2:13:47.260 --> 2:13:52.260\n Or were they told to wait for the center one to start\n\n2:13:54.460 --> 2:13:59.420\n and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked?\n\n2:13:59.420 --> 2:14:00.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:14:00.260 --> 2:14:01.980\n This is very unfortunate.\n\n2:14:01.980 --> 2:14:03.700\n It's very, honestly, it's very possible\n\n2:14:03.700 --> 2:14:05.020\n that they had this meeting.\n\n2:14:05.020 --> 2:14:09.980\n This is the problem with the Olympics.\n\n2:14:09.980 --> 2:14:13.500\n They sometimes, it's also the problem in the Soviet Union\n\n2:14:13.500 --> 2:14:14.340\n with communism.\n\n2:14:14.340 --> 2:14:17.900\n They think the committee knows what's good for the people\n\n2:14:17.900 --> 2:14:18.740\n and so on.\n\n2:14:18.740 --> 2:14:20.740\n So they decide universally\n\n2:14:20.740 --> 2:14:24.020\n as opposed to letting the magic of the Olympics\n\n2:14:24.020 --> 2:14:25.380\n be what it is.\n\n2:14:25.380 --> 2:14:28.540\n But nevertheless, in this case,\n\n2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:31.220\n the center ref decided blue.\n\n2:14:31.220 --> 2:14:33.060\n Like what do you think?\n\n2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:34.820\n Do you think it's just a shitty call?\n\n2:14:34.820 --> 2:14:36.580\n Or like?\n\n2:14:36.580 --> 2:14:38.420\n He has the right to pick.\n\n2:14:38.420 --> 2:14:43.420\n But the problem is the other two I don't think did.\n\n2:14:43.420 --> 2:14:48.100\n And so when you do this frame by frame again,\n\n2:14:48.100 --> 2:14:53.100\n I can see from my own perspective two of the refs.\n\n2:14:54.300 --> 2:14:55.900\n And I see them both blue.\n\n2:14:55.900 --> 2:14:59.380\n So when you fast forward that a little bit\n\n2:14:59.380 --> 2:15:03.060\n to get to all the flags, I see the two go blue.\n\n2:15:03.060 --> 2:15:06.180\n And I go, I look over and I look at the other guy\n\n2:15:06.180 --> 2:15:08.060\n and I'm like, really?\n\n2:15:08.060 --> 2:15:10.700\n All three?\n\n2:15:10.700 --> 2:15:13.580\n I fought for eight minutes and I can't even get a vote.\n\n2:15:13.580 --> 2:15:15.820\n I didn't even get a penalty.\n\n2:15:15.820 --> 2:15:17.740\n I can't even get a vote.\n\n2:15:17.740 --> 2:15:18.980\n And that's when I broke.\n\n2:15:21.460 --> 2:15:24.540\n I like, oh, I couldn't believe it.\n\n2:15:25.980 --> 2:15:28.660\n And I'm not gonna lie, he looked shocked.\n\n2:15:32.660 --> 2:15:34.780\n And here you're on your knees.\n\n2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:35.620\n You're crying.\n\n2:15:35.620 --> 2:15:36.700\n Literally crying.\n\n2:15:36.700 --> 2:15:37.540\n This is it.\n\n2:15:37.540 --> 2:15:38.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:39.220\n But I think it's the end.\n\n2:15:39.220 --> 2:15:40.060\n That was such an amazing match.\n\n2:15:40.060 --> 2:15:41.140\n It was such a war.\n\n2:15:42.980 --> 2:15:45.500\n I mean, both people can't believe what happened.\n\n2:15:45.500 --> 2:15:46.340\n I know.\n\n2:15:46.340 --> 2:15:48.220\n That's the, and like, honestly,\n\n2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:50.700\n I wish we had the rules that we do today,\n\n2:15:50.700 --> 2:15:53.020\n as far as the unlimited golden score,\n\n2:15:53.020 --> 2:15:56.420\n because I would have loved to have seen\n\n2:15:56.420 --> 2:15:57.580\n what would have happened.\n\n2:15:57.580 --> 2:15:59.460\n What was Jimmy saying here to you?\n\n2:15:59.460 --> 2:16:01.460\n I mean, I guess there's nothing to say.\n\n2:16:03.260 --> 2:16:04.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:04.100 --> 2:16:06.980\n He was kind of apologizing for the way\n\n2:16:06.980 --> 2:16:11.260\n the scores went.\n\n2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:13.220\n Cause he knows how badly you want it.\n\n2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:14.660\n He saw the match.\n\n2:16:14.660 --> 2:16:16.940\n And he felt I deserved to win it.\n\n2:16:16.940 --> 2:16:19.260\n Based on like, you know, what happened.\n\n2:16:19.260 --> 2:16:21.060\n But he probably with all his experience\n\n2:16:21.060 --> 2:16:24.340\n knows that this is what the Olympics are about.\n\n2:16:24.340 --> 2:16:26.060\n The refs sometimes.\n\n2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:27.820\n I mean, that's the magic of it, man.\n\n2:16:27.820 --> 2:16:30.300\n Well, and at the same time we're at,\n\n2:16:31.380 --> 2:16:34.100\n we're in the Olympic semi final\n\n2:16:34.100 --> 2:16:37.820\n in a sport that's dominated by certain continents.\n\n2:16:37.820 --> 2:16:40.460\n And when you look at the three refs on the mat,\n\n2:16:40.460 --> 2:16:41.540\n they're all European.\n\n2:16:42.860 --> 2:16:43.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:16:43.700 --> 2:16:45.340\n You're telling me there couldn't have been one Pan Am,\n\n2:16:45.340 --> 2:16:49.020\n one African, one Oceana, you know, different.\n\n2:16:49.860 --> 2:16:51.380\n Like, why'd they all have to be European?\n\n2:16:51.380 --> 2:16:55.620\n But to be fair, it's back to your sauna story.\n\n2:16:55.620 --> 2:16:56.460\n Correct.\n\n2:16:56.460 --> 2:16:57.700\n You've dealt with this stuff before.\n\n2:16:57.700 --> 2:17:00.420\n And you've won over this stuff before.\n\n2:17:00.420 --> 2:17:02.300\n And that's why, like, I was broken for life.\n\n2:17:02.300 --> 2:17:04.340\n And you thought you won here, that was.\n\n2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:09.300\n And when I hindered on that for a year and a half,\n\n2:17:09.300 --> 2:17:11.300\n like I couldn't even stand, I was done.\n\n2:17:13.460 --> 2:17:15.580\n But I'm pretty sure there's a slow motion replay\n\n2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:16.420\n on this when I watched it.\n\n2:17:16.420 --> 2:17:18.380\n Hey, he's all excited, that fucking guy.\n\n2:17:19.740 --> 2:17:20.580\n And he's all happy.\n\n2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:21.420\n It's a relief.\n\n2:17:21.420 --> 2:17:23.580\n Hey, hey, hi guys.\n\n2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:24.420\n I did it.\n\n2:17:26.020 --> 2:17:26.860\n Yeah, so here's like.\n\n2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:27.700\n Look at those teeth.\n\n2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:29.140\n My teeth are red.\n\n2:17:29.140 --> 2:17:32.740\n Slow motion replay of the flag being raised,\n\n2:17:32.740 --> 2:17:35.060\n the heart being broken, Travis just bending over.\n\n2:17:35.060 --> 2:17:35.900\n Right here, watch.\n\n2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:36.820\n Watch his reaction.\n\n2:17:36.820 --> 2:17:39.380\n Like, he, like, you could see his mouth, like,\n\n2:17:39.380 --> 2:17:42.300\n open in awe, like, really?\n\n2:17:42.300 --> 2:17:44.580\n And he's looking at two refs just like I am.\n\n2:17:44.580 --> 2:17:46.940\n He didn't celebrate until he looked at the third one\n\n2:17:46.940 --> 2:17:48.220\n and said, oh, all three.\n\n2:17:49.100 --> 2:17:50.580\n So you think he knew he lost?\n\n2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:52.340\n I think in his head, like,\n\n2:17:53.220 --> 2:17:55.460\n I don't think he really believed he was winning.\n\n2:17:55.460 --> 2:17:57.180\n He did enough to win, yeah.\n\n2:17:57.180 --> 2:17:58.540\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:58.540 --> 2:18:00.340\n Because when his mouth dropped, like,\n\n2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:03.860\n oh yeah, hey, all three.\n\n2:18:03.860 --> 2:18:07.340\n Like, that's not really the reaction you would give.\n\n2:18:07.340 --> 2:18:09.140\n Yeah, I mean, that was,\n\n2:18:10.380 --> 2:18:12.700\n that's one of the greatest matches I've ever seen.\n\n2:18:12.700 --> 2:18:14.300\n I mean, obviously it's painful for you,\n\n2:18:14.300 --> 2:18:19.300\n but that pain, first of all, sets the stage for 2016.\n\n2:18:19.980 --> 2:18:21.740\n But even without that,\n\n2:18:21.740 --> 2:18:25.380\n I think it was just a beautiful story at the Olympics.\n\n2:18:25.380 --> 2:18:28.500\n You've still did incredible job at that Olympics.\n\n2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:30.220\n You stood toe to toe.\n\n2:18:30.220 --> 2:18:35.220\n I think in hindsight, having lost that match\n\n2:18:36.020 --> 2:18:38.580\n did more for me and more for the sport.\n\n2:18:39.460 --> 2:18:40.380\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n2:18:40.380 --> 2:18:42.540\n As a whole, me losing that match.\n\n2:18:42.540 --> 2:18:43.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:18:43.500 --> 2:18:46.020\n I mean, stories aren't about winning.\n\n2:18:46.020 --> 2:18:47.940\n Stories are about the fighting.\n\n2:18:47.940 --> 2:18:50.100\n So, and that made one hell of a story.\n\n2:18:50.100 --> 2:18:55.100\n But it also has to do with, you know,\n\n2:18:55.100 --> 2:18:59.140\n you know, treachery is probably not the right word to use.\n\n2:18:59.140 --> 2:19:02.460\n It's probably the wrong word entirely to use.\n\n2:19:02.460 --> 2:19:06.540\n But because of the conflict in the match\n\n2:19:06.540 --> 2:19:09.860\n and because of how the refs handled the match there\n\n2:19:09.860 --> 2:19:12.980\n at the end, it created controversy\n\n2:19:12.980 --> 2:19:17.980\n that was spoken about for months on world media, right?\n\n2:19:18.140 --> 2:19:21.220\n I remember articles being written about the Olympics\n\n2:19:21.220 --> 2:19:24.100\n and, you know, the refing and how it was corrupt\n\n2:19:24.100 --> 2:19:26.940\n and that match was one of them.\n\n2:19:26.940 --> 2:19:28.500\n There was another one in fencing\n\n2:19:28.500 --> 2:19:30.940\n where like something happened with the timer\n\n2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:35.180\n where one of the fencers, I guess what happens in fencing,\n\n2:19:35.180 --> 2:19:39.780\n the timer resets up a second if it's down.\n\n2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:42.580\n So the fencer got one second played out,\n\n2:19:42.580 --> 2:19:47.340\n I think like 27 or 28 times and then one on like 30.\n\n2:19:48.260 --> 2:19:51.420\n So like there was like clock fixing for fencing.\n\n2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:54.500\n There was this match that I think just got publicity,\n\n2:19:54.500 --> 2:19:55.620\n good or bad.\n\n2:19:55.620 --> 2:19:57.400\n Publicity is publicity for judo.\n\n2:19:58.500 --> 2:20:01.420\n And then you came back to, I mean,\n\n2:20:01.420 --> 2:20:03.380\n this is the hard thing after this heartbreak\n\n2:20:03.380 --> 2:20:06.060\n to step up and continue fighting, right?\n\n2:20:06.060 --> 2:20:09.100\n I really, really struggled.\n\n2:20:09.100 --> 2:20:14.100\n Like unbelievably struggled from 2012 to like 2014.\n\n2:20:14.380 --> 2:20:16.100\n I almost quit numerous times.\n\n2:20:16.100 --> 2:20:17.940\n I was so angry.\n\n2:20:17.940 --> 2:20:21.860\n I mean, at one point I got so mad at the IGF\n\n2:20:21.860 --> 2:20:24.800\n feeling like they were fucking me every step of the way.\n\n2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:28.640\n I threw a water bottle at a referee after a match.\n\n2:20:28.640 --> 2:20:30.620\n I cussed out a referee one time on a mat.\n\n2:20:30.620 --> 2:20:32.280\n I got suspended from the sport\n\n2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:36.040\n because I was just so angry at that point in time.\n\n2:20:36.040 --> 2:20:39.080\n And IGF is the International Judo Federation\n\n2:20:39.080 --> 2:20:41.620\n and are they the people that supply the referees\n\n2:20:41.620 --> 2:20:42.460\n basically like the certification?\n\n2:20:42.460 --> 2:20:45.380\n They kind of run the sport on a global scale.\n\n2:20:45.380 --> 2:20:50.380\n So you sent a few emails 2014, 15, basically quitting.\n\n2:20:54.420 --> 2:20:57.220\n One of them said I'm mentally and physically broken.\n\n2:20:57.220 --> 2:21:00.960\n Another said, well, the subject line, I'm done.\n\n2:21:00.960 --> 2:21:02.720\n The weight cuts didn't break you.\n\n2:21:02.720 --> 2:21:03.560\n No.\n\n2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:06.800\n So if this broke you,\n\n2:21:06.800 --> 2:21:09.540\n you were really going through a hard time.\n\n2:21:09.540 --> 2:21:10.980\n I was like, you know what?\n\n2:21:10.980 --> 2:21:13.100\n We're just gonna like dumb it down a little bit\n\n2:21:13.100 --> 2:21:14.500\n and get some wins under our belt.\n\n2:21:14.500 --> 2:21:16.300\n I'm gonna go to a world cup,\n\n2:21:16.300 --> 2:21:20.080\n which is like three stages down or four stages down\n\n2:21:20.080 --> 2:21:22.860\n from like the Olympic games.\n\n2:21:22.860 --> 2:21:24.540\n Like this should be like a cake walk.\n\n2:21:24.540 --> 2:21:26.100\n Like making the final of a world cup\n\n2:21:26.100 --> 2:21:27.760\n should be a walk in the park.\n\n2:21:28.700 --> 2:21:30.260\n I show up.\n\n2:21:30.260 --> 2:21:35.260\n I barely beat a 16 year old kid, barely.\n\n2:21:35.840 --> 2:21:37.820\n Then I got smoked in the second round.\n\n2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:39.300\n I got thrown three times.\n\n2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:42.420\n I was like, I'm fucking done.\n\n2:21:42.420 --> 2:21:44.340\n They changed all the fucking rules.\n\n2:21:44.340 --> 2:21:46.060\n They fucked me out of the Olympics.\n\n2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:48.480\n Like, what am I supposed to do?\n\n2:21:49.540 --> 2:21:52.500\n And it was at that moment when I wrote the email\n\n2:21:52.500 --> 2:21:55.520\n where I remember sitting at a bar,\n\n2:21:55.520 --> 2:21:56.360\n I don't drink by the way,\n\n2:21:56.360 --> 2:22:00.560\n but I was sitting at a bar at the hotel sending this email\n\n2:22:01.840 --> 2:22:04.300\n and I got a response back from Jimmy and he goes,\n\n2:22:04.300 --> 2:22:07.540\n well, just stay for the training camp,\n\n2:22:07.540 --> 2:22:09.880\n go to Germany and then whatever happens,\n\n2:22:09.880 --> 2:22:10.720\n don't worry about it.\n\n2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:12.380\n We'll talk when you get home.\n\n2:22:12.380 --> 2:22:16.060\n I was like, fuck that, fuck these people, fuck the rules.\n\n2:22:16.060 --> 2:22:17.260\n I don't fucking care anymore.\n\n2:22:17.260 --> 2:22:19.540\n I'm just gonna do judo the way I wanna do judo.\n\n2:22:19.540 --> 2:22:22.900\n If I fucking get shit out, fuck them.\n\n2:22:22.900 --> 2:22:24.860\n That was my response.\n\n2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:26.860\n Can you become an Olympic champion?\n\n2:22:26.860 --> 2:22:28.460\n Can you become an Olympic medalist?\n\n2:22:28.460 --> 2:22:30.060\n With that kind of thinking, you think or no?\n\n2:22:30.060 --> 2:22:32.220\n Was that, that's counterproductive?\n\n2:22:32.220 --> 2:22:33.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:33.060 --> 2:22:37.700\n Okay, just checking because maybe that's also liberating.\n\n2:22:37.700 --> 2:22:39.440\n The expectation was no longer\n\n2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:41.220\n that Travis is gonna win this tournament.\n\n2:22:41.220 --> 2:22:43.780\n The expectation was Travis is gonna come home\n\n2:22:43.780 --> 2:22:44.740\n and be fucking pissed off\n\n2:22:44.740 --> 2:22:45.660\n and we're gonna have to figure out\n\n2:22:45.660 --> 2:22:49.200\n how to manage a pissed off person that's trying to quit\n\n2:22:49.200 --> 2:22:50.860\n that shouldn't be quitting.\n\n2:22:50.860 --> 2:22:52.620\n And did people still believe\n\n2:22:52.620 --> 2:22:54.340\n that you can be a medalist again?\n\n2:22:54.340 --> 2:22:55.180\n Yeah.\n\n2:22:55.180 --> 2:22:56.020\n Like who believed that?\n\n2:22:56.020 --> 2:22:58.780\n Jimmy believed it, the team managers believed it,\n\n2:22:58.780 --> 2:23:00.840\n some of my teammates still believed it,\n\n2:23:01.700 --> 2:23:03.620\n my training partners still did,\n\n2:23:03.620 --> 2:23:06.860\n but they're not the ones that are cutting the weight,\n\n2:23:06.860 --> 2:23:11.620\n flying around, feeling like all of your Judo\n\n2:23:11.620 --> 2:23:12.940\n is now null and void, right?\n\n2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:17.020\n Because at this point, they took away leg grabs entirely.\n\n2:23:17.020 --> 2:23:20.100\n You couldn't break a grip with two hands, right?\n\n2:23:20.100 --> 2:23:23.660\n The meta of Judo has changed again, right?\n\n2:23:23.660 --> 2:23:26.060\n So I got fucked out of it.\n\n2:23:26.060 --> 2:23:28.200\n They took away how I did Judo again\n\n2:23:28.200 --> 2:23:30.780\n and now it's just got more difficult.\n\n2:23:30.780 --> 2:23:34.760\n So when I'm sitting in the hotel and I'm sending this email,\n\n2:23:34.760 --> 2:23:37.060\n I remember being at the training camp,\n\n2:23:37.060 --> 2:23:40.300\n I was like, I don't even fucking care what the rules are,\n\n2:23:40.300 --> 2:23:41.860\n I'm just gonna fucking throw people,\n\n2:23:41.860 --> 2:23:43.380\n I don't even care if I'm cheating,\n\n2:23:43.380 --> 2:23:46.600\n doesn't matter to me, I'll just play stupid, right?\n\n2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:48.660\n So I just started going back and doing Judo\n\n2:23:48.660 --> 2:23:50.080\n without the leg grabs,\n\n2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:54.420\n but with all the same gripping that I was doing beforehand.\n\n2:23:54.420 --> 2:23:56.340\n And then when I got to Germany,\n\n2:23:56.340 --> 2:23:58.620\n I was like, I don't fucking care.\n\n2:23:58.620 --> 2:24:00.820\n I was like, if I gotta cheat to win,\n\n2:24:00.820 --> 2:24:03.060\n then I gotta fucking cheat to win.\n\n2:24:03.060 --> 2:24:06.220\n If I get sheeted out, then I get sheeted out\n\n2:24:06.220 --> 2:24:07.280\n and I won Germany.\n\n2:24:09.380 --> 2:24:10.980\n Which event in Germany?\n\n2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:14.140\n The German Grand Prix, which was a week\n\n2:24:14.140 --> 2:24:16.140\n after losing the World Cup.\n\n2:24:16.140 --> 2:24:20.340\n Because I was trying to do Judo around the new rule set.\n\n2:24:20.340 --> 2:24:23.240\n I wasn't just trying to do Judo, right?\n\n2:24:23.240 --> 2:24:25.820\n Because when you get to the highest level,\n\n2:24:25.820 --> 2:24:28.620\n your game tends to morph around\n\n2:24:28.620 --> 2:24:33.020\n what can you can or cannot get away with.\n\n2:24:33.020 --> 2:24:35.200\n I was more focused on trying to figure out\n\n2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:37.020\n what I can and can't get away with\n\n2:24:37.020 --> 2:24:39.160\n and I stopped actively doing Judo.\n\n2:24:40.060 --> 2:24:42.580\n Once I said, fuck whatever the rule changes are,\n\n2:24:42.580 --> 2:24:43.780\n I'm just gonna keep doing Judo\n\n2:24:43.780 --> 2:24:45.340\n the way I know how to do Judo\n\n2:24:45.340 --> 2:24:47.180\n and if I get a penalty, then so be it.\n\n2:24:48.260 --> 2:24:51.780\n And so that win, that started the road back.\n\n2:24:51.780 --> 2:24:52.920\n The road back, yeah.\n\n2:24:54.380 --> 2:24:57.900\n Cause now it's like, I don't care if you penalize me or not\n\n2:24:57.900 --> 2:25:00.820\n because I'm gonna throw that guy anyways.\n\n2:25:00.820 --> 2:25:02.460\n I'm gonna beat him anyways.\n\n2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:05.340\n And if I get a Shido for doing something wrong,\n\n2:25:05.340 --> 2:25:07.620\n then I'll just stop doing that one thing\n\n2:25:07.620 --> 2:25:09.080\n and just keep doing all the other things\n\n2:25:09.080 --> 2:25:10.740\n that they told me I probably shouldn't be doing\n\n2:25:10.740 --> 2:25:11.820\n but they're not calling me on it\n\n2:25:11.820 --> 2:25:13.420\n so I'm just gonna keep doing it.\n\n2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:20.160\n Well, you found yourself at the 2016 Olympics.\n\n2:25:21.620 --> 2:25:23.140\n Was that ever a doubt, by the way,\n\n2:25:23.140 --> 2:25:27.020\n after this, after 2014 in Germany?\n\n2:25:27.020 --> 2:25:30.480\n I had a lot of doubt after the concussion in 2015.\n\n2:25:31.820 --> 2:25:34.780\n I remember when I first came back\n\n2:25:34.780 --> 2:25:37.820\n after four months of nothingness\n\n2:25:37.820 --> 2:25:41.500\n that even trying to train,\n\n2:25:41.500 --> 2:25:44.660\n the room would start to tilt the world on me.\n\n2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:46.300\n And then when I finally got over that\n\n2:25:46.300 --> 2:25:47.660\n and I could start doing things again,\n\n2:25:47.660 --> 2:25:50.340\n I stepped on the mat for the Pan Ams\n\n2:25:50.340 --> 2:25:54.180\n and I was like, drowning's not the right word\n\n2:25:54.180 --> 2:25:57.500\n but everything was being done in such a slow motion.\n\n2:25:57.500 --> 2:26:01.200\n I had sandbags everywhere that I just couldn't keep up.\n\n2:26:02.820 --> 2:26:04.400\n Like mental fog.\n\n2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:06.940\n Yeah, I remember fighting the Brazilian\n\n2:26:08.020 --> 2:26:10.540\n in the semifinal of Pan Ams.\n\n2:26:10.540 --> 2:26:12.020\n I was halfway through this match\n\n2:26:12.020 --> 2:26:14.460\n and I'm just like, eyes roll up,\n\n2:26:14.460 --> 2:26:16.340\n I'm like, I'm just gonna fucking wing it.\n\n2:26:16.340 --> 2:26:17.180\n And I just fucking winged it\n\n2:26:17.180 --> 2:26:18.900\n and I got countered and thrown free pwn\n\n2:26:18.900 --> 2:26:21.900\n and I was like, I don't even know what to do.\n\n2:26:21.900 --> 2:26:24.380\n And I couldn't even think clearly.\n\n2:26:24.380 --> 2:26:27.460\n And that's when I was like, I may not come back.\n\n2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:28.300\n Yeah.\n\n2:26:28.300 --> 2:26:30.340\n You don't have control over how to come back from this.\n\n2:26:30.340 --> 2:26:31.580\n It's like, it's just your mind\n\n2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:33.740\n and it's not operating correctly.\n\n2:26:33.740 --> 2:26:35.020\n It's not like I can like,\n\n2:26:35.020 --> 2:26:37.740\n oh, my right hand's not working because it's fractured.\n\n2:26:37.740 --> 2:26:39.340\n Let me figure out a way I can not use that.\n\n2:26:39.340 --> 2:26:40.700\n Like when your mind's not working,\n\n2:26:40.700 --> 2:26:44.300\n like it's the one thing you need.\n\n2:26:44.300 --> 2:26:45.740\n Like you gotta have it.\n\n2:26:45.740 --> 2:26:47.460\n So I can work through anything else.\n\n2:26:47.460 --> 2:26:49.140\n I needed that though.\n\n2:26:49.140 --> 2:26:51.420\n And so how did you come back from that time?\n\n2:26:51.420 --> 2:26:53.460\n That's when I wrote another email and I was like,\n\n2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:55.020\n I'm fucking off team USA.\n\n2:26:55.020 --> 2:26:57.460\n I'm not fucking, I'm all done with USA judo.\n\n2:26:57.460 --> 2:26:58.580\n I'm done with the tour.\n\n2:26:58.580 --> 2:27:00.100\n I was like, I quit.\n\n2:27:00.100 --> 2:27:01.900\n Well, I'm gonna go do my own thing.\n\n2:27:01.900 --> 2:27:03.540\n They were like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n2:27:03.540 --> 2:27:04.740\n Can't quit now.\n\n2:27:04.740 --> 2:27:05.980\n Olympics is in like a year.\n\n2:27:05.980 --> 2:27:07.300\n Like let's talk about this again\n\n2:27:07.300 --> 2:27:08.900\n cause it's the second time I've tried to quit\n\n2:27:08.900 --> 2:27:10.260\n in like two years.\n\n2:27:10.260 --> 2:27:11.100\n Right?\n\n2:27:12.380 --> 2:27:14.940\n So then we sit down in Jimmy's office and he's like,\n\n2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:16.740\n whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't quit.\n\n2:27:16.740 --> 2:27:19.300\n You're gonna kick yourself if you don't go to Rio.\n\n2:27:19.300 --> 2:27:22.180\n I'm telling you right now, don't do that to yourself.\n\n2:27:22.180 --> 2:27:23.860\n Let's figure out a way of like doing this.\n\n2:27:23.860 --> 2:27:27.060\n And I was like, because when we trained before,\n\n2:27:27.060 --> 2:27:29.140\n we did it as a unit, right?\n\n2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:30.540\n We all went to the same tournaments.\n\n2:27:30.540 --> 2:27:31.980\n We all went to the same training camps.\n\n2:27:31.980 --> 2:27:33.860\n And I'm like, you guys are treating me\n\n2:27:33.860 --> 2:27:36.100\n like I'm the same player I used to be.\n\n2:27:36.100 --> 2:27:38.420\n I go, I don't, I'm not operating\n\n2:27:38.420 --> 2:27:40.100\n at the level you think I'm operating at.\n\n2:27:40.100 --> 2:27:41.500\n I go, I can't do that.\n\n2:27:41.500 --> 2:27:43.860\n And he goes, well, what do you wanna do?\n\n2:27:43.860 --> 2:27:45.380\n And I go, I'll tell you what Jimmy,\n\n2:27:45.380 --> 2:27:47.820\n you know I'm being serious because my answer\n\n2:27:47.820 --> 2:27:49.700\n is something you'd never would have expected.\n\n2:27:49.700 --> 2:27:52.620\n I go, why don't you just send me to Japan for three weeks?\n\n2:27:52.620 --> 2:27:54.620\n And he was like, really?\n\n2:27:54.620 --> 2:27:55.980\n I hated Japan.\n\n2:27:55.980 --> 2:27:58.500\n I refused to go there up until this point.\n\n2:27:59.340 --> 2:28:01.580\n But I was like, I have to get to a point\n\n2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:05.780\n where I can get so tired and get through it\n\n2:28:05.780 --> 2:28:07.980\n that like my Judo will come back\n\n2:28:07.980 --> 2:28:09.460\n and my body will learn again.\n\n2:28:10.460 --> 2:28:12.540\n And when you say Japan, you mean the Kodokan,\n\n2:28:12.540 --> 2:28:16.900\n like what's Tokai, is that the highest level of Judo?\n\n2:28:16.900 --> 2:28:18.860\n It's one of the top colleges in the world, yeah.\n\n2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:21.340\n And that's so you can go with the best people in the world.\n\n2:28:21.340 --> 2:28:22.700\n You can go to war with them.\n\n2:28:22.700 --> 2:28:24.620\n Top level, like strong players.\n\n2:28:24.620 --> 2:28:27.220\n Yeah, there's a lot of very strong players.\n\n2:28:27.220 --> 2:28:29.540\n There's a lot of middle class players\n\n2:28:29.540 --> 2:28:32.100\n and there's a lot of volume of rounds.\n\n2:28:32.100 --> 2:28:35.100\n So you value all of it, the middle class too, like the.\n\n2:28:35.100 --> 2:28:37.620\n Because when you're tired, like you can't just train\n\n2:28:37.620 --> 2:28:41.700\n in areas where you're battling for every inch.\n\n2:28:41.700 --> 2:28:46.020\n At some point you have to be successful, right?\n\n2:28:46.020 --> 2:28:48.980\n So you still under duress and under strain\n\n2:28:48.980 --> 2:28:51.100\n and through exhaustion,\n\n2:28:51.100 --> 2:28:53.740\n you still have to have the ability to score.\n\n2:28:53.740 --> 2:28:55.180\n Well, if you're training with the best people\n\n2:28:55.180 --> 2:28:56.060\n in the world all the time,\n\n2:28:56.060 --> 2:28:58.180\n you're not always gonna be able to score.\n\n2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:00.300\n So you still need those B level players\n\n2:29:00.300 --> 2:29:02.900\n in order to really develop again.\n\n2:29:03.820 --> 2:29:06.100\n What is it like, if you can comment briefly\n\n2:29:06.100 --> 2:29:08.740\n on the training in Japan,\n\n2:29:08.740 --> 2:29:11.700\n what's it like to go into a different place?\n\n2:29:11.700 --> 2:29:14.060\n You probably don't speak the language that well.\n\n2:29:14.060 --> 2:29:17.020\n Like, is there an isolation aspect to it?\n\n2:29:17.020 --> 2:29:19.940\n Is it like purely about judo now?\n\n2:29:19.940 --> 2:29:22.020\n I really want it to be isolated.\n\n2:29:22.020 --> 2:29:24.700\n No training partners, no coaches.\n\n2:29:24.700 --> 2:29:26.980\n I want it to get back to my roots\n\n2:29:26.980 --> 2:29:28.740\n and just learn how to fight again.\n\n2:29:30.220 --> 2:29:32.460\n I don't wanna figure out how to beat the German.\n\n2:29:32.460 --> 2:29:37.340\n I don't wanna figure out how I can develop a new entry\n\n2:29:37.340 --> 2:29:41.300\n into my sale against, you know, whoever it may be.\n\n2:29:41.300 --> 2:29:42.140\n It's not.\n\n2:29:42.140 --> 2:29:42.980\n You just wanna fight hard.\n\n2:29:42.980 --> 2:29:44.100\n You just wanna fight.\n\n2:29:44.100 --> 2:29:45.260\n Let me get back to fighting.\n\n2:29:45.260 --> 2:29:48.580\n Let me get back to like the root of who I am.\n\n2:29:48.580 --> 2:29:49.900\n What were those sessions like?\n\n2:29:49.900 --> 2:29:51.020\n What were we talking about?\n\n2:29:51.020 --> 2:29:51.940\n Five minute rounds?\n\n2:29:51.940 --> 2:29:53.260\n Like what, how many?\n\n2:29:53.260 --> 2:29:55.580\n Six minute rounds, 30 minute breaks,\n\n2:29:55.580 --> 2:29:57.000\n 14 rounds a session.\n\n2:29:58.860 --> 2:30:00.260\n Sorry, what's the 30 minute break?\n\n2:30:00.260 --> 2:30:01.540\n 30 second break.\n\n2:30:01.540 --> 2:30:02.380\n 30 second break.\n\n2:30:02.380 --> 2:30:03.220\n 30 second break.\n\n2:30:04.780 --> 2:30:05.620\n Sorry, what?\n\n2:30:05.620 --> 2:30:06.460\n 14?\n\n2:30:06.460 --> 2:30:07.300\n 14 rounds.\n\n2:30:07.300 --> 2:30:08.180\n 14 rounds.\n\n2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:09.580\n Every day?\n\n2:30:09.580 --> 2:30:10.580\n Every day.\n\n2:30:10.580 --> 2:30:13.460\n Like five days a week\n\n2:30:13.460 --> 2:30:17.300\n and then 11 or 12 rounds on Saturday.\n\n2:30:17.300 --> 2:30:19.740\n Plus weightlifting, plus running.\n\n2:30:19.740 --> 2:30:21.540\n Plus weightlifting, plus running.\n\n2:30:21.540 --> 2:30:23.580\n So those are hard rounds.\n\n2:30:23.580 --> 2:30:25.340\n What's it feel like to go through that?\n\n2:30:25.340 --> 2:30:30.180\n So you have a bunch of just a sea of black belts, Japan.\n\n2:30:31.420 --> 2:30:33.720\n I'm sure they're hunting you a little bit.\n\n2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:35.320\n Depending on who you are.\n\n2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:36.520\n I was hunted a little bit.\n\n2:30:36.520 --> 2:30:39.700\n Like I didn't really struggle because of who I am.\n\n2:30:39.700 --> 2:30:41.740\n Them as college athletes,\n\n2:30:41.740 --> 2:30:44.180\n they wanna show to their coaches\n\n2:30:44.180 --> 2:30:46.300\n and their higher players,\n\n2:30:46.300 --> 2:30:50.080\n like, oh look, I can throw the world number whoever.\n\n2:30:50.080 --> 2:30:52.180\n But if you're just a guy who shows up,\n\n2:30:52.180 --> 2:30:55.980\n like them beating you doesn't provide any value\n\n2:30:55.980 --> 2:30:57.180\n or raise their status.\n\n2:30:57.180 --> 2:30:59.740\n No, but you're status raising.\n\n2:30:59.740 --> 2:31:00.940\n Yes.\n\n2:31:00.940 --> 2:31:04.340\n So I was actually like in a situation\n\n2:31:04.340 --> 2:31:06.540\n where nobody was watching me\n\n2:31:06.540 --> 2:31:09.180\n and I was free to just battle at my own will.\n\n2:31:09.180 --> 2:31:10.200\n Okay.\n\n2:31:10.200 --> 2:31:12.500\n Which is what it was about for me.\n\n2:31:12.500 --> 2:31:14.300\n And you just push yourself.\n\n2:31:14.300 --> 2:31:15.600\n Because I knew how to do that.\n\n2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:17.900\n I know how to push myself.\n\n2:31:17.900 --> 2:31:19.900\n Are you, when you're doing these 14 rounds,\n\n2:31:19.900 --> 2:31:23.500\n is every single one a standalone thing for you?\n\n2:31:23.500 --> 2:31:24.340\n Yep.\n\n2:31:24.340 --> 2:31:25.700\n So you're not trying to pace yourself?\n\n2:31:25.700 --> 2:31:26.740\n No.\n\n2:31:26.740 --> 2:31:29.580\n Each one is to as much exhaustion as I can get.\n\n2:31:29.580 --> 2:31:33.160\n But then there must be ones where like it's like round nine\n\n2:31:33.160 --> 2:31:35.020\n where you got nothing left.\n\n2:31:35.020 --> 2:31:36.700\n Better figure out how to score.\n\n2:31:36.700 --> 2:31:38.200\n That's all you gotta do.\n\n2:31:38.200 --> 2:31:40.100\n You gotta survive and you gotta score.\n\n2:31:41.540 --> 2:31:44.300\n What's your memories of that, of those three weeks?\n\n2:31:44.300 --> 2:31:46.700\n What's like, what stands out to you?\n\n2:31:46.700 --> 2:31:47.540\n It seems like,\n\n2:31:48.580 --> 2:31:51.060\n cause that's the place where you found the silver medal.\n\n2:31:51.060 --> 2:31:51.900\n Yep.\n\n2:31:53.460 --> 2:31:56.060\n Because it's the place most people don't want to be.\n\n2:31:57.480 --> 2:31:59.300\n Everybody's comfortable.\n\n2:31:59.300 --> 2:32:01.260\n I would rather,\n\n2:32:01.260 --> 2:32:03.860\n I would rather find out who I am and what I'm made of\n\n2:32:03.860 --> 2:32:06.280\n and find those, those end points.\n\n2:32:06.280 --> 2:32:08.340\n And if I can't find them,\n\n2:32:08.340 --> 2:32:11.660\n then that means everybody else has given up before me.\n\n2:32:14.280 --> 2:32:16.980\n Were there a few people that just kinda,\n\n2:32:16.980 --> 2:32:19.940\n you returned to battle over and over in those times\n\n2:32:19.940 --> 2:32:21.580\n and then it was just.\n\n2:32:21.580 --> 2:32:22.420\n Yep.\n\n2:32:24.100 --> 2:32:25.800\n No social media.\n\n2:32:25.800 --> 2:32:26.640\n Nope.\n\n2:32:26.640 --> 2:32:28.580\n None of that, it's just like two men.\n\n2:32:28.580 --> 2:32:30.140\n You lock yourself in your room,\n\n2:32:30.140 --> 2:32:32.540\n you come back, you've thought about it\n\n2:32:32.540 --> 2:32:35.400\n and you come back with a game plan for that day.\n\n2:32:35.400 --> 2:32:37.540\n Against some players here or there\n\n2:32:37.540 --> 2:32:40.780\n and I would, I would develop a hit list.\n\n2:32:40.780 --> 2:32:41.740\n Like I would be like,\n\n2:32:41.740 --> 2:32:44.540\n oh, that motherfucker grabbed me at like 13\n\n2:32:44.540 --> 2:32:46.400\n and I watched him sit fucking four rounds\n\n2:32:46.400 --> 2:32:48.220\n and then come try to kick the shit out of me.\n\n2:32:48.220 --> 2:32:49.520\n I'm gonna fucking grab that guy early\n\n2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:51.580\n and I'm gonna beat the shit out of him.\n\n2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:53.180\n And you just develop that list.\n\n2:32:53.180 --> 2:32:55.540\n There's probably some epic battles in that room, right?\n\n2:32:55.540 --> 2:32:56.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:32:57.780 --> 2:32:58.660\n What's it look like?\n\n2:32:58.660 --> 2:33:00.020\n Like how crowded is it?\n\n2:33:00.020 --> 2:33:01.020\n Very.\n\n2:33:01.020 --> 2:33:02.980\n And so you're just like, yeah.\n\n2:33:02.980 --> 2:33:04.040\n Just sea of people.\n\n2:33:04.040 --> 2:33:05.100\n Sea of people.\n\n2:33:05.100 --> 2:33:05.940\n And you're trying to,\n\n2:33:05.940 --> 2:33:06.900\n are you doing groundwork at all?\n\n2:33:06.900 --> 2:33:07.740\n Just throws.\n\n2:33:07.740 --> 2:33:08.580\n Just throws.\n\n2:33:08.580 --> 2:33:09.400\n Just throws.\n\n2:33:09.400 --> 2:33:10.240\n No transitions, no nothing.\n\n2:33:10.240 --> 2:33:12.180\n But if I get pissed off and like you keep dropping\n\n2:33:12.180 --> 2:33:14.140\n or like not letting me do what I wanna do,\n\n2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:16.020\n I'll rip a choke right across your face.\n\n2:33:16.020 --> 2:33:18.100\n Just to let you know that like,\n\n2:33:18.100 --> 2:33:18.940\n and if I wanted to.\n\n2:33:18.940 --> 2:33:21.940\n You have a really nice style of just like\n\n2:33:22.900 --> 2:33:26.740\n respectfully bullying the shit out of people.\n\n2:33:26.740 --> 2:33:28.240\n Cause some people call me a bully\n\n2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:30.260\n and I have to remind them that like\n\n2:33:31.100 --> 2:33:34.660\n a bully enjoys like beating up the weak.\n\n2:33:34.660 --> 2:33:35.500\n Right.\n\n2:33:35.500 --> 2:33:38.020\n I wanna beat the person that fights back.\n\n2:33:38.020 --> 2:33:38.860\n Right, exactly.\n\n2:33:38.860 --> 2:33:40.940\n It's not fun for me if you don't fight back.\n\n2:33:40.940 --> 2:33:41.780\n Right.\n\n2:33:41.780 --> 2:33:44.600\n Some of the greatest people I've seen like do this,\n\n2:33:44.600 --> 2:33:45.820\n they basically,\n\n2:33:46.620 --> 2:33:48.600\n you have this in the Iowa wrestling rooms,\n\n2:33:48.600 --> 2:33:49.900\n they'll push each other into the wall.\n\n2:33:49.900 --> 2:33:51.680\n Like they get, there's like anger,\n\n2:33:51.680 --> 2:33:53.580\n but it's ultimately underneath it all.\n\n2:33:53.580 --> 2:33:55.180\n It's like a deep respect.\n\n2:33:55.180 --> 2:33:57.380\n I was training with Colton Brown one time\n\n2:33:57.380 --> 2:33:58.880\n and I went to San Jose State\n\n2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:01.420\n cause I was in California for something.\n\n2:34:01.420 --> 2:34:02.540\n And he kept like,\n\n2:34:02.540 --> 2:34:04.540\n he kept circling to the edge.\n\n2:34:04.540 --> 2:34:06.540\n They had like a cupboard that had like,\n\n2:34:06.540 --> 2:34:07.440\n when you opened it,\n\n2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:09.460\n it had like all the tape and like medical supplies.\n\n2:34:09.460 --> 2:34:11.860\n I was like, we'll fucking put you right through that.\n\n2:34:11.860 --> 2:34:13.620\n And he kind of giggled.\n\n2:34:13.620 --> 2:34:14.540\n And then he went by that edge\n\n2:34:14.540 --> 2:34:15.780\n and I fucking ran him right through it.\n\n2:34:15.780 --> 2:34:16.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:16.620 --> 2:34:19.020\n See, to me, that's an ultimate sign of respect\n\n2:34:19.020 --> 2:34:21.780\n that both you and Colton will remember well.\n\n2:34:21.780 --> 2:34:22.780\n And we're still friends.\n\n2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:23.620\n We still talk.\n\n2:34:23.620 --> 2:34:24.780\n It's just, I told him I was gonna do it.\n\n2:34:24.780 --> 2:34:25.900\n He knew I meant it too.\n\n2:34:25.900 --> 2:34:26.740\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:26.740 --> 2:34:27.800\n He did it anyways.\n\n2:34:27.800 --> 2:34:28.880\n That just tested me.\n\n2:34:31.820 --> 2:34:32.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:34:32.980 --> 2:34:33.980\n Listen, that's,\n\n2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:35.900\n and that same attitude was,\n\n2:34:35.900 --> 2:34:39.580\n that was in Japan just day after day after day after day.\n\n2:34:39.580 --> 2:34:40.660\n 14 rounds.\n\n2:34:40.660 --> 2:34:42.060\n That's rough.\n\n2:34:42.060 --> 2:34:44.260\n And you didn't sit out rounds?\n\n2:34:44.260 --> 2:34:46.160\n And I did it all with a broken hand.\n\n2:34:47.940 --> 2:34:48.780\n How?\n\n2:34:50.540 --> 2:34:52.420\n How did you do it with a broken hand?\n\n2:34:52.420 --> 2:34:53.700\n You show up every day.\n\n2:34:53.700 --> 2:34:54.540\n You show up.\n\n2:34:54.540 --> 2:34:55.380\n Okay.\n\n2:34:55.380 --> 2:34:56.280\n Which one, left or right?\n\n2:34:56.280 --> 2:34:57.580\n My right.\n\n2:34:57.580 --> 2:34:58.420\n Okay.\n\n2:34:58.420 --> 2:34:59.240\n So that's okay.\n\n2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:01.500\n So you can then focus on gripping with your left.\n\n2:35:01.500 --> 2:35:02.740\n It's always a way.\n\n2:35:02.740 --> 2:35:04.020\n It's always a way.\n\n2:35:04.020 --> 2:35:04.900\n But that means you can't,\n\n2:35:04.900 --> 2:35:07.020\n I guess you don't have to grip with your right sometimes.\n\n2:35:07.020 --> 2:35:10.260\n I would palm it with my thumb just like hanging out\n\n2:35:10.260 --> 2:35:11.460\n like this, just like this.\n\n2:35:11.460 --> 2:35:12.660\n So you can do something.\n\n2:35:12.660 --> 2:35:14.020\n So you can do like a Goshi,\n\n2:35:14.020 --> 2:35:14.860\n cause you have a,\n\n2:35:16.020 --> 2:35:16.860\n cause I,\n\n2:35:16.860 --> 2:35:17.740\n what were your main throws?\n\n2:35:17.740 --> 2:35:19.020\n It was Seinagi.\n\n2:35:19.020 --> 2:35:20.460\n Koshiguruma.\n\n2:35:20.460 --> 2:35:21.300\n Okay.\n\n2:35:21.300 --> 2:35:22.140\n Sumi.\n\n2:35:22.140 --> 2:35:22.960\n Uchimata.\n\n2:35:22.960 --> 2:35:23.800\n Uchimata.\n\n2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:27.760\n But you have this big like a Goshi type of thing.\n\n2:35:27.760 --> 2:35:28.600\n Like a.\n\n2:35:28.600 --> 2:35:30.660\n Yeah, but not from like around the waist.\n\n2:35:30.660 --> 2:35:32.140\n It's from over the shoulder.\n\n2:35:32.140 --> 2:35:32.980\n Over the shoulder.\n\n2:35:32.980 --> 2:35:35.420\n And I can do it with just the one hand.\n\n2:35:35.420 --> 2:35:36.920\n Oh, sorry, which one hand?\n\n2:35:36.920 --> 2:35:38.140\n The right one.\n\n2:35:38.140 --> 2:35:39.660\n I don't need the sleeve hand.\n\n2:35:39.660 --> 2:35:40.600\n You don't need the sleeve hand,\n\n2:35:40.600 --> 2:35:42.820\n but you couldn't do it with the broken hand.\n\n2:35:42.820 --> 2:35:44.340\n I could.\n\n2:35:44.340 --> 2:35:45.820\n Cause I can just put my hand in the gi\n\n2:35:45.820 --> 2:35:47.100\n so it can't come off.\n\n2:35:48.020 --> 2:35:49.100\n And then you just,\n\n2:35:50.380 --> 2:35:52.460\n cause what happened was three days\n\n2:35:52.460 --> 2:35:53.980\n before I was leaving for Japan,\n\n2:35:53.980 --> 2:35:57.060\n a guy, my hand was rested like this on a mat\n\n2:35:57.060 --> 2:35:59.740\n and the guy, boom, took my whole thumb off\n\n2:35:59.740 --> 2:36:02.400\n and tore all the tendons in the palm.\n\n2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:05.100\n So when I went to the doctor, he was like,\n\n2:36:05.100 --> 2:36:06.900\n you know, do we have to put a cast on it?\n\n2:36:06.900 --> 2:36:08.380\n And I go, I'm leaving in three days.\n\n2:36:08.380 --> 2:36:10.220\n You're not putting a cast on it.\n\n2:36:10.220 --> 2:36:11.820\n And I go, this is what I want you to do.\n\n2:36:11.820 --> 2:36:12.820\n Just like this, I said,\n\n2:36:12.820 --> 2:36:16.220\n I want you to build a cast that holds it,\n\n2:36:16.220 --> 2:36:19.820\n that Velcros around so that when I'm not training,\n\n2:36:19.820 --> 2:36:21.180\n I can wear it.\n\n2:36:21.180 --> 2:36:22.780\n But then when I'm training,\n\n2:36:22.780 --> 2:36:25.140\n I'll take it off and then I'll put the tape on it.\n\n2:36:25.140 --> 2:36:26.940\n And then whatever happens, happens.\n\n2:36:26.940 --> 2:36:31.360\n Whatever happens, happens.\n\n2:36:31.360 --> 2:36:33.160\n All right, so that's Epic.\n\n2:36:33.160 --> 2:36:37.260\n And that led you to the 2016 Olympics in Rio.\n\n2:36:37.260 --> 2:36:39.720\n Well, that led me to winning Pan Am Gold\n\n2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:41.280\n when I got back from Japan\n\n2:36:41.280 --> 2:36:44.320\n and then almost getting my leg cut off in 2015.\n\n2:36:45.740 --> 2:36:49.400\n That was like, I don't know, maybe a month or two later.\n\n2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:51.680\n I was hospitalized for seven days.\n\n2:36:51.680 --> 2:36:53.560\n The leg being cut off for what?\n\n2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:56.120\n I had three different types of bacterial infections\n\n2:36:56.120 --> 2:36:59.200\n in my right leg, a whole leg swelled.\n\n2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:04.160\n And it was in my blood, skin and in my bone,\n\n2:37:04.160 --> 2:37:05.020\n in my right leg.\n\n2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:11.920\n So I got stuck at MGH in a hospital for seven days\n\n2:37:11.920 --> 2:37:15.920\n until they figured out what the bacteria source was.\n\n2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:17.720\n Where was the source of the infection?\n\n2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:19.000\n Is it in the knee?\n\n2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:19.840\n In the knee?\n\n2:37:19.840 --> 2:37:20.680\n Yeah.\n\n2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:23.400\n Okay, so obviously there's a danger of like,\n\n2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:24.600\n that's life threatening.\n\n2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:26.920\n Yep, so when I went into the emergency room,\n\n2:37:26.920 --> 2:37:28.640\n when I got back from the Worlds,\n\n2:37:28.640 --> 2:37:30.880\n the lady was like, hey, you need to call,\n\n2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:34.120\n you're gonna call because you may lose your leg tonight.\n\n2:37:34.120 --> 2:37:36.000\n And then they put me in the hospital.\n\n2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.200\n What do you think of this whole time?\n\n2:37:38.200 --> 2:37:40.400\n Are you still thinking about Olympics?\n\n2:37:40.400 --> 2:37:43.520\n They put me into the room like four hours later,\n\n2:37:43.520 --> 2:37:44.700\n the doctor came in.\n\n2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:50.840\n I was at MGH in Boston and he was like,\n\n2:37:50.840 --> 2:37:53.040\n you have a serious infection in your leg.\n\n2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:56.080\n I go, he's like, we have to keep you hospitalized\n\n2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:57.320\n until we can figure out what it is.\n\n2:37:57.320 --> 2:37:59.520\n And I was like, buddy,\n\n2:37:59.520 --> 2:38:01.320\n I have the Olympic games in less than a year.\n\n2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:03.560\n I go, I don't give a fuck what it is.\n\n2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:05.640\n I go, just fucking take it out\n\n2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:06.800\n and let me get on with my day.\n\n2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:08.960\n He goes, we can't do that.\n\n2:38:08.960 --> 2:38:10.580\n Like, I don't understand.\n\n2:38:10.580 --> 2:38:12.240\n I go, you told me it's infected,\n\n2:38:12.240 --> 2:38:14.580\n just cut away that part of the tissue,\n\n2:38:14.580 --> 2:38:16.000\n drain it, do whatever you gotta do\n\n2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:17.360\n and then send me on my way.\n\n2:38:17.360 --> 2:38:18.960\n He's like, it doesn't work like that.\n\n2:38:18.960 --> 2:38:20.640\n He said, until we figure out what it is,\n\n2:38:20.640 --> 2:38:22.840\n we can't figure out how to stop it from growing\n\n2:38:22.840 --> 2:38:24.360\n or how far it spread.\n\n2:38:24.360 --> 2:38:27.640\n So it took them seven days to figure out what it was.\n\n2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:29.480\n Then once they figured out what it was,\n\n2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:31.520\n I went in for surgery to remove it.\n\n2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:35.600\n Then I spent, I think it was eight weeks\n\n2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:38.460\n in home care with a PICC line.\n\n2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:41.600\n And then I came back from that.\n\n2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:43.360\n On the first week and a half of judo,\n\n2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:46.820\n I tore my SI joint trying to throw a guy.\n\n2:38:46.820 --> 2:38:49.920\n And then I came back from that about a month later\n\n2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:52.420\n and then fifth at the Connell Cup.\n\n2:38:52.420 --> 2:38:54.280\n And then the games six months later.\n\n2:38:54.280 --> 2:38:57.880\n How quickly do doctors understand who they're dealing with?\n\n2:38:57.880 --> 2:38:59.920\n Like, is that difficult for you to explain\n\n2:38:59.920 --> 2:39:02.760\n who Travis Stevens is when you go to visit a doctor?\n\n2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:07.120\n I don't think they understand, you know,\n\n2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:10.600\n their role is to get me to do my job\n\n2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:13.840\n to the best of their ability as a doctor.\n\n2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:16.240\n Meaning, it's gonna be less than what they want.\n\n2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:21.240\n And they struggle conceptually with like,\n\n2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:26.280\n but the textbook tells me this.\n\n2:39:26.280 --> 2:39:28.760\n And I go, but I'm not a textbook, right?\n\n2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:30.460\n Like when you go to physical therapy,\n\n2:39:30.460 --> 2:39:32.600\n the first thing they do is they pull out that binder\n\n2:39:32.600 --> 2:39:35.500\n that says day one, we do this exercise.\n\n2:39:35.500 --> 2:39:38.720\n I go, but I have my own goals.\n\n2:39:38.720 --> 2:39:41.320\n Your job is to help me meet my goal.\n\n2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:43.160\n Let's work a plan to do that\n\n2:39:43.160 --> 2:39:44.960\n or I gotta go find somebody else.\n\n2:39:44.960 --> 2:39:47.120\n Did the doctors in general,\n\n2:39:47.120 --> 2:39:50.120\n people outside of your close knit group step up?\n\n2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:52.860\n If they didn't, I found somebody else.\n\n2:39:52.860 --> 2:39:55.740\n And typically I could find a person\n\n2:39:55.740 --> 2:39:57.360\n who knew the right person.\n\n2:39:58.760 --> 2:40:00.240\n I always wonder with people like,\n\n2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:02.800\n cause I'm constantly surrounded by,\n\n2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:04.800\n one of the biggest problems in my life has been,\n\n2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:07.960\n there's a lot of people in my life who love me very much,\n\n2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:11.300\n but who want me to the equivalent of that situation.\n\n2:40:12.280 --> 2:40:14.600\n You know, definitely don't go to the Olympics\n\n2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:16.120\n and definitely like,\n\n2:40:16.120 --> 2:40:18.080\n it seems like the world is full of people\n\n2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:22.240\n that want you to be average and happy, which is great,\n\n2:40:22.240 --> 2:40:23.080\n which is fine.\n\n2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:25.640\n I mean, perhaps that's the way it should be.\n\n2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:27.680\n Like, you know, my parents, people close to you,\n\n2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:31.800\n that's what love, how love manifests itself often in people.\n\n2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:35.220\n But then like, I think the ultimate manifestation of love\n\n2:40:35.220 --> 2:40:37.220\n is understanding who this person is.\n\n2:40:37.220 --> 2:40:40.400\n Here's a madman who's driven towards a particular thing.\n\n2:40:40.400 --> 2:40:43.640\n And the best thing for you to do is not to say,\n\n2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:48.520\n like rest is to say, work harder.\n\n2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:52.720\n Like fuck your infection.\n\n2:40:52.720 --> 2:40:54.080\n You should be training.\n\n2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:57.320\n Have you ever met anybody as crazy as you\n\n2:40:57.320 --> 2:40:58.460\n that can help you?\n\n2:40:58.460 --> 2:41:02.080\n Most of us who get to this point get there\n\n2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:05.920\n because we're all a little unstable.\n\n2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:07.440\n Even my wife, Galita, right?\n\n2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:11.020\n Like when she was getting ready for 2016,\n\n2:41:11.020 --> 2:41:13.900\n or when she was getting ready for 2020,\n\n2:41:13.900 --> 2:41:16.980\n because she moved to Boston to be a coach,\n\n2:41:16.980 --> 2:41:21.980\n she had a neck problem, right?\n\n2:41:22.780 --> 2:41:26.940\n And at some point in time, it's like,\n\n2:41:26.940 --> 2:41:29.040\n what's really important?\n\n2:41:29.040 --> 2:41:31.820\n Day to day life or judo?\n\n2:41:31.820 --> 2:41:35.760\n And believe it or not, the doctor in Canada was like,\n\n2:41:36.820 --> 2:41:39.480\n I am never under any circumstances\n\n2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:41.100\n doing an MRI of your neck again.\n\n2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:44.100\n That's what she told her.\n\n2:41:44.100 --> 2:41:46.140\n She goes, if you have me do an MRI,\n\n2:41:46.140 --> 2:41:47.400\n you're not doing judo again.\n\n2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:52.000\n So just know if you hurt your neck and it requires an MRI,\n\n2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:53.980\n you're done with judo forever.\n\n2:41:53.980 --> 2:41:56.320\n So decide if you wanna do judo or not.\n\n2:41:56.320 --> 2:41:58.980\n That was a conversation we actually had to have.\n\n2:41:58.980 --> 2:42:01.780\n That's a cool thing for a doctor to say.\n\n2:42:01.780 --> 2:42:05.260\n I mean, it depends how bad ass they sound when they say it.\n\n2:42:05.260 --> 2:42:06.460\n So that's a tough conversation.\n\n2:42:06.460 --> 2:42:09.860\n Judo one, what's this with your wife?\n\n2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:11.100\n What's that relationship like?\n\n2:42:11.100 --> 2:42:13.180\n So you're both a little crazy.\n\n2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:14.020\n A little bit.\n\n2:42:14.020 --> 2:42:18.000\n In a good sense, or from my perspective, in a good sense.\n\n2:42:18.000 --> 2:42:23.000\n Yeah, it's just, we understand that when you set a goal\n\n2:42:24.620 --> 2:42:28.780\n to do something, you're not signing on for the good.\n\n2:42:28.780 --> 2:42:29.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:29.620 --> 2:42:31.380\n You're signing on for the bad.\n\n2:42:31.380 --> 2:42:34.080\n And I don't think a lot of people understand that.\n\n2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:37.040\n That's like a Valentine's Day card from Travis Stevens.\n\n2:42:38.140 --> 2:42:40.740\n You have to accept everything negative\n\n2:42:40.740 --> 2:42:42.420\n that could possibly happen.\n\n2:42:42.420 --> 2:42:44.500\n And until you do, you're never gonna make it.\n\n2:42:44.500 --> 2:42:46.420\n Because you'll always sell yourself short.\n\n2:42:46.420 --> 2:42:47.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:42:47.260 --> 2:42:48.300\n You'll never go far enough.\n\n2:42:49.460 --> 2:42:50.700\n And if you sign up for the whole thing,\n\n2:42:50.700 --> 2:42:53.220\n then the negative is just like, oh, great.\n\n2:42:53.220 --> 2:42:54.500\n I expected that.\n\n2:42:54.500 --> 2:42:56.220\n If you're experiencing the negative,\n\n2:42:56.220 --> 2:42:58.180\n they're also experiencing the negative.\n\n2:42:58.180 --> 2:42:59.100\n And if you overcome it,\n\n2:42:59.100 --> 2:43:00.980\n maybe they'll get knocked out for it.\n\n2:43:00.980 --> 2:43:01.820\n Yep.\n\n2:43:01.820 --> 2:43:02.720\n Maybe they won't deal with it.\n\n2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:05.140\n Maybe they won't train through it.\n\n2:43:05.140 --> 2:43:06.900\n Right, when I had my five herniated disc\n\n2:43:06.900 --> 2:43:07.900\n and I was in a neck brace,\n\n2:43:07.900 --> 2:43:09.900\n I was still in the gym at seven a.m.\n\n2:43:09.900 --> 2:43:10.740\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:10.740 --> 2:43:12.260\n Doing whatever it is I could do\n\n2:43:12.260 --> 2:43:15.020\n because my job is to be at the gym.\n\n2:43:15.020 --> 2:43:17.180\n David Goggins, I don't know if you know the guy,\n\n2:43:17.180 --> 2:43:20.300\n he's gone, he's damaged lots of parts of his body,\n\n2:43:20.300 --> 2:43:23.100\n like you, trying to achieve things.\n\n2:43:23.100 --> 2:43:28.020\n So, unlike you, his achievements are like,\n\n2:43:28.020 --> 2:43:30.660\n your achievements come with the medal.\n\n2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:33.700\n He's just running in the darkness in the middle of nowhere\n\n2:43:33.700 --> 2:43:34.540\n by himself.\n\n2:43:34.540 --> 2:43:36.940\n It's like, I mean, it's the same probably as with you\n\n2:43:36.940 --> 2:43:39.300\n if you're able to be introspective about it,\n\n2:43:39.300 --> 2:43:41.900\n is he's just battling his own inner demons\n\n2:43:41.900 --> 2:43:44.060\n and working through those\n\n2:43:44.060 --> 2:43:47.660\n and is breaking his body doing so.\n\n2:43:47.660 --> 2:43:51.260\n Are you cognizant of the trade off of the fact\n\n2:43:51.260 --> 2:43:54.860\n that you're damaging your body\n\n2:43:55.920 --> 2:43:57.860\n to get to these levels of achievements,\n\n2:43:57.860 --> 2:44:00.740\n of this level of excellence, of this level of greatness?\n\n2:44:00.740 --> 2:44:02.540\n I mean, I guess that depends\n\n2:44:02.540 --> 2:44:04.340\n on what you consider damage really\n\n2:44:04.340 --> 2:44:08.140\n because I don't really see that I have damaged my body.\n\n2:44:08.140 --> 2:44:10.540\n If anything, I think I've strengthened it.\n\n2:44:10.540 --> 2:44:12.300\n My body can go through more than yours can.\n\n2:44:12.300 --> 2:44:13.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:13.140 --> 2:44:13.960\n Who's is weaker?\n\n2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:14.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:17.260\n Right?\n\n2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:19.560\n It's just like the Thai boxers, right?\n\n2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:20.400\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:20.400 --> 2:44:21.280\n In order to strengthen their shins,\n\n2:44:21.280 --> 2:44:22.700\n they gotta break it a few times.\n\n2:44:22.700 --> 2:44:23.540\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:23.540 --> 2:44:24.600\n It's just nature of the beast.\n\n2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:26.820\n You just had to break a bunch of stuff\n\n2:44:26.820 --> 2:44:28.260\n to find where the weak points are\n\n2:44:28.260 --> 2:44:29.580\n and then made them stronger.\n\n2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:30.420\n Yep.\n\n2:44:30.420 --> 2:44:31.860\n Or strengthen the areas around it\n\n2:44:31.860 --> 2:44:36.140\n to strengthen it by the sheer relation to it.\n\n2:44:36.140 --> 2:44:38.940\n But the problem is you may not be able to do judo\n\n2:44:41.860 --> 2:44:43.520\n for until you're 70.\n\n2:44:44.380 --> 2:44:45.700\n Why not?\n\n2:44:45.700 --> 2:44:47.980\n I may not be able to do judo to the level I used to.\n\n2:44:47.980 --> 2:44:48.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:48.820 --> 2:44:50.380\n Don't get me wrong, but I can still do judo.\n\n2:44:50.380 --> 2:44:51.220\n You can still do judo.\n\n2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:53.980\n And I think a lot of people struggle with,\n\n2:44:53.980 --> 2:44:55.380\n they wanna keep doing it\n\n2:44:55.380 --> 2:44:57.260\n like they used to be able to do it.\n\n2:44:57.260 --> 2:44:59.000\n I don't try to do judo like I used to,\n\n2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:00.460\n like you're seeing here.\n\n2:45:00.460 --> 2:45:02.660\n I'm not that guy anymore.\n\n2:45:02.660 --> 2:45:03.660\n I accept that.\n\n2:45:03.660 --> 2:45:05.740\n I don't even try to be that guy anymore.\n\n2:45:06.900 --> 2:45:09.820\n I'm a completely different player today than I am\n\n2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:11.520\n when I was winning Olympic medals.\n\n2:45:15.300 --> 2:45:18.940\n And so I guess when you're looking at my journey\n\n2:45:18.940 --> 2:45:22.900\n and the trade off is I never sacrificed anything.\n\n2:45:22.900 --> 2:45:26.580\n The people around me sacrificed for me.\n\n2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:30.900\n And I never had a downturn after the Olympics\n\n2:45:30.900 --> 2:45:33.440\n because I never identified as an Olympian.\n\n2:45:35.780 --> 2:45:38.280\n You know, a lot of Olympians suffer from depression\n\n2:45:38.280 --> 2:45:39.120\n afterwards.\n\n2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:40.300\n Because they identify as it.\n\n2:45:40.300 --> 2:45:42.460\n Now they don't have who they are.\n\n2:45:42.460 --> 2:45:46.920\n Where was your personal moment of greatness?\n\n2:45:46.920 --> 2:45:49.760\n Like, or do you not experience life that way?\n\n2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:52.100\n Where you were truly proud to be yourself?\n\n2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:52.940\n Like.\n\n2:45:52.940 --> 2:45:53.780\n Every day I wake up.\n\n2:45:56.220 --> 2:45:57.820\n You wake up and you're not proud of who you are,\n\n2:45:57.820 --> 2:46:01.420\n then you've really gotta seek out some help.\n\n2:46:01.420 --> 2:46:03.900\n So that's, first of all, okay, I'll do that\n\n2:46:03.900 --> 2:46:07.300\n because I definitely am not proud of who I am.\n\n2:46:07.300 --> 2:46:11.220\n I just wonder if you didn't identify with the Olympics,\n\n2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:14.020\n was there times, maybe in the training room,\n\n2:46:14.020 --> 2:46:19.020\n maybe in Japan, where you just kinda felt like,\n\n2:46:19.020 --> 2:46:24.020\n I get more of an emotional, I guess, trigger, right?\n\n2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:27.420\n Where like, I feel proud of what I've done\n\n2:46:27.420 --> 2:46:32.380\n when I've set to a task and I've done it.\n\n2:46:33.340 --> 2:46:35.080\n So almost any task.\n\n2:46:35.080 --> 2:46:38.580\n And the more challenging the task, the more reward.\n\n2:46:40.060 --> 2:46:44.860\n You fought a lot of amazing battles in 2016 Olympics.\n\n2:46:44.860 --> 2:46:47.940\n So you got, you beat the, let's see,\n\n2:46:47.940 --> 2:46:51.660\n the world number four in the quarterfinals.\n\n2:46:51.660 --> 2:46:52.620\n It's like a replay.\n\n2:46:52.620 --> 2:46:54.020\n Every single Olympics, you're,\n\n2:46:54.940 --> 2:46:55.780\n all the people.\n\n2:46:55.780 --> 2:46:57.260\n I got terrible draws.\n\n2:46:57.260 --> 2:46:58.260\n Terrible draws.\n\n2:46:58.260 --> 2:46:59.300\n And then you're facing,\n\n2:46:59.300 --> 2:47:00.620\n this is where I was like watching this,\n\n2:47:00.620 --> 2:47:02.060\n I'm like, yeah, he's screwed.\n\n2:47:02.060 --> 2:47:05.340\n You faced the world number one, the Georgian, in the.\n\n2:47:05.340 --> 2:47:07.300\n By the way, for people who don't know,\n\n2:47:07.300 --> 2:47:11.580\n he beat me five times to my beating him once,\n\n2:47:11.580 --> 2:47:13.880\n and the one time I beat him was in London.\n\n2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:16.600\n And all other times he beat me, he beat me biathlon.\n\n2:47:16.600 --> 2:47:19.760\n And not by like a little throw,\n\n2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:21.980\n like he threw me on my head.\n\n2:47:22.860 --> 2:47:25.420\n At one point we were in Georgia.\n\n2:47:25.420 --> 2:47:27.040\n I'm fighting him in the final.\n\n2:47:27.040 --> 2:47:29.220\n I go to my teammate and I go, guess what?\n\n2:47:29.220 --> 2:47:30.520\n Make sure you watch this fight.\n\n2:47:30.520 --> 2:47:32.320\n Somebody's getting thrown free pwn.\n\n2:47:32.320 --> 2:47:34.720\n This match ain't, this ain't match going to distance.\n\n2:47:34.720 --> 2:47:36.360\n And about a minute in,\n\n2:47:36.360 --> 2:47:38.920\n I tried to take his head off with a big Koshiguruma,\n\n2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:40.520\n which is like a head and arm.\n\n2:47:41.400 --> 2:47:42.880\n He caught me and then threw me on my head\n\n2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:44.060\n and ended the match.\n\n2:47:44.060 --> 2:47:48.340\n So first of all, we're watching the video of you,\n\n2:47:48.340 --> 2:47:50.580\n again, standing next to the guy\n\n2:47:50.580 --> 2:47:52.640\n leading up to your semifinal match.\n\n2:47:52.640 --> 2:47:56.580\n So here, if you win this, you're guaranteed a medal.\n\n2:47:56.580 --> 2:47:59.420\n But the chances of you winning, from my fan perspective,\n\n2:47:59.420 --> 2:48:00.580\n I was like, God damn it.\n\n2:48:01.660 --> 2:48:03.660\n You and the rest of the world, except for me.\n\n2:48:03.660 --> 2:48:04.500\n Except for you.\n\n2:48:04.500 --> 2:48:05.340\n What are you saying?\n\n2:48:05.340 --> 2:48:07.060\n You're talking to yourself here.\n\n2:48:07.060 --> 2:48:08.080\n What are you saying?\n\n2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:09.700\n My name is Travis Stevens.\n\n2:48:09.700 --> 2:48:10.940\n I'm an Olympic champion.\n\n2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:14.540\n I will not be denied.\n\n2:48:14.540 --> 2:48:15.540\n The George is probably like,\n\n2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:17.780\n what the hell is this guy saying?\n\n2:48:17.780 --> 2:48:19.220\n What is he talking to himself?\n\n2:48:20.500 --> 2:48:22.340\n So he was probably ultra confident.\n\n2:48:22.340 --> 2:48:24.340\n Yeah, had to be.\n\n2:48:24.340 --> 2:48:26.060\n The difference is,\n\n2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:29.220\n is I understood the last five times he beat me.\n\n2:48:29.220 --> 2:48:32.380\n I was purposely trying to throw him, not beat him.\n\n2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:35.060\n I wanted to find out if I could.\n\n2:48:35.940 --> 2:48:36.840\n Turns out I can't.\n\n2:48:38.140 --> 2:48:40.660\n But I don't need to throw him to beat him.\n\n2:48:40.660 --> 2:48:42.500\n I need to know how to not lose.\n\n2:48:44.780 --> 2:48:47.860\n But you were still going for stuff here.\n\n2:48:47.860 --> 2:48:51.300\n But all of my attacks drag him to the ground.\n\n2:48:51.300 --> 2:48:53.060\n They're never standing on my feet.\n\n2:48:55.160 --> 2:48:56.980\n Which is a complete, which is a distinction\n\n2:48:56.980 --> 2:48:59.000\n that we talked about at the very beginning, right?\n\n2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:00.220\n You have throws where you're standing\n\n2:49:00.220 --> 2:49:01.660\n and throws where you're dropping.\n\n2:49:01.660 --> 2:49:04.220\n Every time I try to throw him standing,\n\n2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:05.340\n he throws me free pony.\n\n2:49:05.340 --> 2:49:08.460\n He picks me up and he throws me on my head, literally.\n\n2:49:08.460 --> 2:49:10.860\n So what I did is I just needed to get to that last\n\n2:49:10.860 --> 2:49:13.840\n one minute mark, which is what he does mentally\n\n2:49:13.840 --> 2:49:16.820\n in his own Judo, where he changes into a panic\n\n2:49:16.820 --> 2:49:20.500\n and just tries to do things that are uncharacteristic.\n\n2:49:21.620 --> 2:49:23.580\n So you knew he's gonna start panicking here\n\n2:49:23.580 --> 2:49:26.180\n as the match draws to a close\n\n2:49:26.180 --> 2:49:29.620\n and you both have a Shido, a penalty.\n\n2:49:29.620 --> 2:49:31.620\n Did we pass the point where I went for broke\n\n2:49:31.620 --> 2:49:32.660\n and I broke my rule?\n\n2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:34.860\n Which one?\n\n2:49:34.860 --> 2:49:39.860\n I went for a crazy foot sweep, like Ippon switch thing.\n\n2:49:42.460 --> 2:49:43.780\n I can't even remember what it's called\n\n2:49:43.780 --> 2:49:45.460\n because it's not used that often.\n\n2:49:45.460 --> 2:49:47.620\n And he actually landed on top of me\n\n2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:50.420\n and some people wanted it to be called Ippon.\n\n2:49:50.420 --> 2:49:53.180\n But he had actually let go of the gi\n\n2:49:53.180 --> 2:49:54.360\n and was looking for the mat.\n\n2:49:54.360 --> 2:49:55.620\n So he didn't have any control.\n\n2:49:55.620 --> 2:49:57.260\n So they didn't award him a point.\n\n2:49:59.100 --> 2:49:59.920\n Yeah, and here we go.\n\n2:49:59.920 --> 2:50:00.940\n Now we're getting down into the,\n\n2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:02.420\n see like he's getting frustrated.\n\n2:50:02.420 --> 2:50:03.260\n Great.\n\n2:50:03.260 --> 2:50:05.780\n I love it. Perfect.\n\n2:50:05.780 --> 2:50:07.300\n Second penalty, no big deal.\n\n2:50:07.300 --> 2:50:09.380\n We just got to get to the one minute mark.\n\n2:50:09.380 --> 2:50:10.580\n That's all we got to do.\n\n2:50:13.700 --> 2:50:15.460\n So there's no panic here for you.\n\n2:50:15.460 --> 2:50:18.000\n Nope, I'm right where I need to be and look it.\n\n2:50:19.380 --> 2:50:21.600\n Now, if you go back into this match,\n\n2:50:23.340 --> 2:50:25.380\n I would love for somebody to go back\n\n2:50:25.380 --> 2:50:29.860\n and see how many times he did a drop right Ippon Seinagi.\n\n2:50:31.020 --> 2:50:32.300\n Probably never.\n\n2:50:32.300 --> 2:50:33.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:50:33.140 --> 2:50:34.300\n Why is he doing it now?\n\n2:50:35.660 --> 2:50:38.220\n Cause he panics and he changes his Judo\n\n2:50:38.220 --> 2:50:39.500\n at that one minute mark.\n\n2:50:40.900 --> 2:50:43.180\n Look how much I kept that grip.\n\n2:50:43.180 --> 2:50:46.740\n Yeah, you kept, you have that grip this whole time.\n\n2:50:46.740 --> 2:50:48.060\n You have your left hand.\n\n2:50:48.060 --> 2:50:48.980\n Walking him down.\n\n2:50:48.980 --> 2:50:50.040\n Walking him down.\n\n2:50:51.380 --> 2:50:54.780\n He, you keep the grip as he's throwing.\n\n2:50:54.780 --> 2:50:55.620\n Yeah.\n\n2:50:55.620 --> 2:50:58.800\n Which, were you thinking choke as he drops or no?\n\n2:50:58.800 --> 2:51:00.460\n It's just kind of natural instinct.\n\n2:51:00.460 --> 2:51:02.140\n Yeah, because we drilled it.\n\n2:51:02.140 --> 2:51:04.300\n I spent two years drilling this transition.\n\n2:51:04.300 --> 2:51:08.500\n And then very, so for people that don't do Judo, Jujitsu,\n\n2:51:08.500 --> 2:51:09.980\n it's like really nice.\n\n2:51:09.980 --> 2:51:12.580\n You keep, everything is nicely controlled\n\n2:51:12.580 --> 2:51:15.060\n to where you're keeping that Gi under his chin.\n\n2:51:15.060 --> 2:51:16.460\n Like it's really tight control.\n\n2:51:16.460 --> 2:51:19.240\n Like it's very, like you're, I guess it's drilling,\n\n2:51:19.240 --> 2:51:21.300\n but you're cognizant of the position of your wrist\n\n2:51:21.300 --> 2:51:22.140\n the whole time.\n\n2:51:22.140 --> 2:51:25.740\n And you can tell based on like just years of doing it,\n\n2:51:25.740 --> 2:51:27.860\n whether it's under or it's not.\n\n2:51:27.860 --> 2:51:29.740\n You can just feel the difference.\n\n2:51:29.740 --> 2:51:32.220\n And it's probably, even if you wanted to stop that,\n\n2:51:32.220 --> 2:51:34.820\n it's very difficult because your whole time, it's like.\n\n2:51:34.820 --> 2:51:37.280\n Once it's under, it's almost impossible to stop.\n\n2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:41.220\n For people who practice Jujitsu, don't practice Judo,\n\n2:51:41.220 --> 2:51:44.620\n one of the very annoying things about Judo\n\n2:51:44.620 --> 2:51:47.420\n is in order to do Gi chokes,\n\n2:51:47.420 --> 2:51:48.820\n they have to be under the chin.\n\n2:51:48.820 --> 2:51:50.220\n Yes.\n\n2:51:50.220 --> 2:51:52.460\n Even though the kind of intense chokes you do\n\n2:51:52.460 --> 2:51:54.760\n work just fine over the chin, but.\n\n2:51:55.860 --> 2:51:59.380\n And the kicker here and why we practice this choke\n\n2:51:59.380 --> 2:52:01.140\n was because when you go back and watch\n\n2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:04.620\n all of the other matches, he always does this tripod\n\n2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:06.220\n when I try to do arm locks,\n\n2:52:06.220 --> 2:52:08.060\n which is typically what I would do.\n\n2:52:08.060 --> 2:52:10.380\n And when I do that, he ends up sliding out\n\n2:52:10.380 --> 2:52:12.340\n and I end up falling off.\n\n2:52:12.340 --> 2:52:14.740\n So you step up here with the choke,\n\n2:52:14.740 --> 2:52:18.140\n he does a tripod where he sticks his button to the air\n\n2:52:18.140 --> 2:52:23.140\n and you, dude, what's the name of this choke?\n\n2:52:23.420 --> 2:52:24.860\n Bone arrow.\n\n2:52:24.860 --> 2:52:27.180\n No, but, okay, but I mean, when you do from like,\n\n2:52:27.180 --> 2:52:30.260\n from that position, is there a way,\n\n2:52:30.260 --> 2:52:32.740\n this entry into the bone arrow, I guess,\n\n2:52:32.740 --> 2:52:33.580\n because you're doing.\n\n2:52:33.580 --> 2:52:36.380\n We refer to Judo as a British strangle,\n\n2:52:36.380 --> 2:52:38.260\n when they're in that turtle position\n\n2:52:38.260 --> 2:52:39.940\n and you do that rolling motion.\n\n2:52:39.940 --> 2:52:41.500\n Cool.\n\n2:52:41.500 --> 2:52:43.900\n And here, when you go into that,\n\n2:52:43.900 --> 2:52:45.620\n you can fall off of him, like you said,\n\n2:52:45.620 --> 2:52:47.300\n if you're going for an arm bar,\n\n2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:50.820\n but here, literally, because you have it under the chin\n\n2:52:50.820 --> 2:52:53.320\n really well, there's just a nice control.\n\n2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:56.740\n And I've already planned on it being on his chin.\n\n2:52:56.740 --> 2:52:58.620\n That's why I've hooked the arm, right?\n\n2:52:58.620 --> 2:53:00.340\n It's already starting to go straight.\n\n2:53:00.340 --> 2:53:03.660\n Probably this choke in the early stages,\n\n2:53:03.660 --> 2:53:06.800\n like a few frames before, feels like it,\n\n2:53:08.420 --> 2:53:11.460\n like you're safe, it's fine.\n\n2:53:11.460 --> 2:53:13.860\n Like the head will slip out or something like that.\n\n2:53:13.860 --> 2:53:17.900\n Yeah, and that's why my left knee is up by his shoulder,\n\n2:53:17.900 --> 2:53:20.700\n to keep that pressure down so that he can't posture it up.\n\n2:53:24.240 --> 2:53:25.940\n When did you know you have this?\n\n2:53:25.940 --> 2:53:27.140\n Oh, it works right here.\n\n2:53:29.820 --> 2:53:34.320\n I actually panicked right about here.\n\n2:53:36.620 --> 2:53:39.020\n Was maybe his head could come out?\n\n2:53:39.020 --> 2:53:42.060\n My hand, I tore the muscle in my palm\n\n2:53:42.060 --> 2:53:44.500\n because I was pulling so hard that I'm like,\n\n2:53:45.700 --> 2:53:47.320\n he may not tap.\n\n2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:48.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:53:48.160 --> 2:53:52.140\n Like, is my hand just going to give out beforehand?\n\n2:53:52.140 --> 2:53:52.980\n And there he is.\n\n2:53:52.980 --> 2:53:55.020\n And we're right on this edge, right?\n\n2:53:55.020 --> 2:53:57.060\n So like, if we roll a little bit outside\n\n2:53:57.060 --> 2:54:00.340\n and I still don't have it, like that ref could stop it.\n\n2:54:00.340 --> 2:54:02.000\n And then I felt him tapping and.\n\n2:54:03.460 --> 2:54:08.160\n Oh, that, he's heartbroken.\n\n2:54:08.160 --> 2:54:09.000\n I felt.\n\n2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:10.260\n Surprised.\n\n2:54:10.260 --> 2:54:11.320\n There it is.\n\n2:54:13.100 --> 2:54:13.940\n The relief.\n\n2:54:13.940 --> 2:54:15.100\n Olympic final.\n\n2:54:17.340 --> 2:54:22.020\n And he knew, he knew he lost an Olympic medal right there\n\n2:54:22.020 --> 2:54:23.980\n because he already knew\n\n2:54:23.980 --> 2:54:26.740\n that the Japanese guy was going to be his bronze,\n\n2:54:26.740 --> 2:54:27.740\n that he never beats.\n\n2:54:29.660 --> 2:54:34.660\n See the, but also he probably in his head\n\n2:54:35.420 --> 2:54:37.540\n was confident that he would be in the final.\n\n2:54:37.540 --> 2:54:38.620\n Correct.\n\n2:54:38.620 --> 2:54:41.780\n And so like this, he almost is surprised.\n\n2:54:41.780 --> 2:54:42.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:54:42.860 --> 2:54:45.140\n It's not supposed to happen this way.\n\n2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:47.140\n And it's the second time it's happened.\n\n2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:52.140\n And that's how you became an Olympic medalist.\n\n2:54:54.800 --> 2:54:56.560\n Man, that must be a great feeling.\n\n2:54:57.440 --> 2:54:59.440\n That must be a great feeling right here.\n\n2:55:00.840 --> 2:55:04.320\n Just like all the years of injuries, all of it.\n\n2:55:07.500 --> 2:55:11.120\n As fans that watch this too, it's like, holy shit.\n\n2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:11.960\n He actually did it.\n\n2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:13.960\n And it's a packed stadium too.\n\n2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:15.160\n Not one empty seat.\n\n2:55:15.160 --> 2:55:18.080\n Oh man.\n\n2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:21.420\n So maybe what were you thinking here?\n\n2:55:22.760 --> 2:55:24.360\n I'll just focus on the next match.\n\n2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:25.600\n Yeah.\n\n2:55:25.600 --> 2:55:30.600\n It took me maybe like a minute or so to like decompress\n\n2:55:32.940 --> 2:55:35.960\n and then like get back to like my normal state\n\n2:55:35.960 --> 2:55:36.800\n for the final.\n\n2:55:39.340 --> 2:55:42.700\n So the final is against the,\n\n2:55:42.700 --> 2:55:45.460\n the Russian here.\n\n2:55:45.460 --> 2:55:47.300\n What can you say about your mindset?\n\n2:55:49.180 --> 2:55:50.660\n You're saying the exact same thing.\n\n2:55:50.660 --> 2:55:51.660\n Same thing.\n\n2:55:51.660 --> 2:55:54.300\n Travel Stevens, Olympic champion.\n\n2:55:54.300 --> 2:55:58.180\n I will not be denied because I had felt like in London\n\n2:55:58.180 --> 2:56:02.500\n and throughout the years, I felt like I kept getting robbed.\n\n2:56:02.500 --> 2:56:04.700\n So I made sure in my mantra to add that little bit\n\n2:56:04.700 --> 2:56:07.700\n at the end to reassure myself that like,\n\n2:56:07.700 --> 2:56:10.580\n they are not gonna control the outcome of today.\n\n2:56:10.580 --> 2:56:12.280\n I'm gonna control the outcome.\n\n2:56:12.280 --> 2:56:14.180\n What did you know about the Russian?\n\n2:56:14.180 --> 2:56:15.020\n Everything.\n\n2:56:17.180 --> 2:56:20.420\n And I honestly, I thought I had won the Olympics right now.\n\n2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:22.500\n And I still do think that today.\n\n2:56:22.500 --> 2:56:26.180\n Just like mentally when you think about it,\n\n2:56:26.180 --> 2:56:31.180\n that I've won like, yeah, he threw me,\n\n2:56:33.840 --> 2:56:35.580\n but it was like a one in a million chance\n\n2:56:35.580 --> 2:56:37.580\n that that worked for him.\n\n2:56:37.580 --> 2:56:38.540\n Like, come on.\n\n2:56:38.540 --> 2:56:42.420\n So it's not like you feel lucky to be in the final.\n\n2:56:42.420 --> 2:56:44.700\n It's like, you deserve to be champion.\n\n2:56:44.700 --> 2:56:47.860\n Again, remember, I'm anticipating the goal.\n\n2:56:47.860 --> 2:56:49.460\n Like I'm past that.\n\n2:56:50.500 --> 2:56:52.140\n There's a confidence in the way you're moving\n\n2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:52.980\n and the way you're.\n\n2:56:52.980 --> 2:56:54.420\n Yeah, like I have his sleeve.\n\n2:56:54.420 --> 2:56:55.400\n He's not breaking it.\n\n2:56:55.400 --> 2:56:57.820\n Like still walking him down, still going forward.\n\n2:56:57.820 --> 2:57:02.500\n Like I knew exactly how I was gonna beat him.\n\n2:57:04.180 --> 2:57:06.460\n And I developed a plan because when I was getting ready\n\n2:57:06.460 --> 2:57:10.900\n for Rio, we brought in a lot of the top Japanese players\n\n2:57:10.900 --> 2:57:13.940\n that weren't invited to the camp for the national team\n\n2:57:13.940 --> 2:57:14.780\n to Boston.\n\n2:57:14.780 --> 2:57:16.380\n So I had four people, three of them were\n\n2:57:16.380 --> 2:57:17.260\n on the national team.\n\n2:57:17.260 --> 2:57:20.820\n One of them had won the universities in Japan,\n\n2:57:20.820 --> 2:57:22.140\n all at 81 kilos.\n\n2:57:23.100 --> 2:57:25.460\n I only got thrown once during camp for a month.\n\n2:57:25.460 --> 2:57:26.420\n Wow.\n\n2:57:26.420 --> 2:57:29.080\n Like I was ready.\n\n2:57:31.380 --> 2:57:33.880\n I just, I fucking slipped.\n\n2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:36.680\n Where does it happen?\n\n2:57:36.680 --> 2:57:37.780\n Right when he threw me.\n\n2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:40.640\n So if you let this play out really quick,\n\n2:57:40.640 --> 2:57:42.360\n there's a point right here where I'm gonna come around\n\n2:57:42.360 --> 2:57:46.800\n his back and I'm kinda gonna just yoko sutemi,\n\n2:57:46.800 --> 2:57:48.460\n which means like a lateral drop.\n\n2:57:48.460 --> 2:57:50.360\n And I'm just gonna bring him down to the floor,\n\n2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:52.380\n which isn't a throw right here.\n\n2:57:52.380 --> 2:57:54.480\n It's more of like a takedown, right?\n\n2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:55.860\n I'm trying to get him to the ground\n\n2:57:55.860 --> 2:57:57.160\n cause I wanna burn him.\n\n2:57:57.160 --> 2:57:58.920\n He doesn't do any waza.\n\n2:57:58.920 --> 2:58:00.200\n So I'm just gonna keep burning him.\n\n2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:04.120\n And you can see that like I get really close here.\n\n2:58:05.160 --> 2:58:08.440\n He just went a little too far to his side\n\n2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:09.660\n during this exchange.\n\n2:58:10.760 --> 2:58:12.360\n And like he's running.\n\n2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:13.440\n I'm like, ah, he.\n\n2:58:17.480 --> 2:58:20.100\n He's very wiry for an 81 kg player.\n\n2:58:20.100 --> 2:58:20.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:58:20.940 --> 2:58:23.520\n There's not much like muscle on him.\n\n2:58:23.520 --> 2:58:26.040\n But he uses his length and his leverage very well.\n\n2:58:26.040 --> 2:58:28.120\n And you can see like I'm really burning the clock here.\n\n2:58:28.120 --> 2:58:30.560\n Like I'm owning these exchanges\n\n2:58:30.560 --> 2:58:32.440\n more than I'm owning the tachi waza ones,\n\n2:58:32.440 --> 2:58:33.600\n the ones in our feet.\n\n2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:36.320\n So you weren't trying to necessarily like submit him here\n\n2:58:36.320 --> 2:58:40.840\n or like really hard or like pin him.\n\n2:58:40.840 --> 2:58:43.240\n You were trying to break him a bit.\n\n2:58:43.240 --> 2:58:44.880\n I'm doing both.\n\n2:58:44.880 --> 2:58:46.620\n I'm being overly physical.\n\n2:58:48.320 --> 2:58:51.240\n And to a lot of the BJJ people who are watching this,\n\n2:58:51.240 --> 2:58:54.120\n like they're like, oh, well I would have done this.\n\n2:58:54.120 --> 2:58:55.020\n I would have done that.\n\n2:58:55.020 --> 2:58:58.800\n You've got to think like if that referee\n\n2:58:58.800 --> 2:59:00.200\n who's reffing the judo side of it\n\n2:59:00.200 --> 2:59:02.600\n looks at it for a couple of seconds and is like,\n\n2:59:03.540 --> 2:59:05.080\n he's not really moving.\n\n2:59:05.080 --> 2:59:06.200\n They'll stop it.\n\n2:59:06.200 --> 2:59:07.040\n Yeah.\n\n2:59:07.040 --> 2:59:09.960\n So you're like, you understand judo.\n\n2:59:09.960 --> 2:59:10.800\n Yeah.\n\n2:59:10.800 --> 2:59:12.040\n What's called ne waza groundwork.\n\n2:59:12.040 --> 2:59:14.920\n Like what you, cause you're really showing it to the ref.\n\n2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:15.760\n Yes.\n\n2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:17.960\n You have to show movement and progression.\n\n2:59:19.440 --> 2:59:20.600\n That hurt the forehead.\n\n2:59:20.600 --> 2:59:23.420\n Like see, I threw that hand in there kind of hard,\n\n2:59:23.420 --> 2:59:25.840\n ripping it across his face just because.\n\n2:59:29.480 --> 2:59:31.760\n I got to tell you there's a calm.\n\n2:59:31.760 --> 2:59:35.120\n Well, no, he does look a little broken,\n\n2:59:35.120 --> 2:59:38.440\n but the Russians have like this calmness.\n\n2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:40.840\n They're pretty good at.\n\n2:59:40.840 --> 2:59:44.320\n Well, don't forget they've competed like this for long time.\n\n2:59:44.320 --> 2:59:45.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:59:45.160 --> 2:59:45.980\n It's all he knows.\n\n2:59:47.680 --> 2:59:48.720\n And this is where I lose it.\n\n2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:50.400\n See how my knee hit the ground.\n\n2:59:50.400 --> 2:59:53.080\n My knee wasn't supposed to touch the ground.\n\n2:59:53.080 --> 2:59:55.840\n I was supposed to sit to my hip to bring him down.\n\n2:59:55.840 --> 2:59:58.120\n Something happened where my knee touched\n\n2:59:58.120 --> 3:00:00.400\n and it didn't happen in the first one.\n\n3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:01.520\n It just happened there.\n\n3:00:02.360 --> 3:00:05.760\n So like that, we never should have been in that predicament.\n\n3:00:05.760 --> 3:00:07.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:10.040\n And that's one of the things where\n\n3:00:10.040 --> 3:00:12.840\n when you're looking at sports\n\n3:00:12.840 --> 3:00:15.480\n for anybody who's trying to improve,\n\n3:00:17.280 --> 3:00:19.680\n you have to, when you're trying to improve,\n\n3:00:19.680 --> 3:00:23.820\n you've really got to ignore the ends of the spectrums.\n\n3:00:24.960 --> 3:00:28.280\n The oopsies and the they got lucky.\n\n3:00:28.280 --> 3:00:29.840\n And you only focus on the middle.\n\n3:00:29.840 --> 3:00:33.080\n Like the technique I was doing was perfectly sound.\n\n3:00:34.160 --> 3:00:36.720\n It just happened that the one oopsie happened on the stage\n\n3:00:36.720 --> 3:00:38.320\n it shouldn't have happened on.\n\n3:00:38.320 --> 3:00:43.260\n And there's no amount of drilling\n\n3:00:43.260 --> 3:00:47.880\n that will ever like prevent that from happening.\n\n3:00:47.880 --> 3:00:49.360\n And that's just the.\n\n3:00:49.360 --> 3:00:50.200\n That's sports.\n\n3:00:50.200 --> 3:00:52.000\n That's sports, especially the Olympics,\n\n3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:54.000\n especially Judo when it's like one.\n\n3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:54.840\n You got one mistake.\n\n3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:56.800\n Oopsie can just be your.\n\n3:00:56.800 --> 3:00:57.920\n That's it.\n\n3:00:57.920 --> 3:00:58.760\n That's it.\n\n3:00:58.760 --> 3:01:00.160\n You know, it really requires\n\n3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:02.720\n and you have to wrap your head around the idea of like,\n\n3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:04.760\n if you want the ability to beat these people\n\n3:01:04.760 --> 3:01:05.680\n and throw these people,\n\n3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:08.160\n like you got to be willing to get thrown yourself.\n\n3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:09.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:01:10.480 --> 3:01:11.640\n Like this isn't boxing.\n\n3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:13.520\n There's no like, I'm going to stand in a place\n\n3:01:13.520 --> 3:01:16.120\n where he can't hit me and I can hit him.\n\n3:01:16.120 --> 3:01:18.800\n Because we have the gi and because they can grab it,\n\n3:01:18.800 --> 3:01:21.600\n they have just as much ability to throw you as you them.\n\n3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:24.300\n So how'd you feel here?\n\n3:01:24.300 --> 3:01:26.560\n How long was the duration of you feeling upset\n\n3:01:26.560 --> 3:01:28.240\n that you didn't get the gold versus.\n\n3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:29.120\n Never felt it.\n\n3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:29.960\n Never felt it.\n\n3:01:30.980 --> 3:01:32.320\n Just.\n\n3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:34.080\n Because he didn't beat me.\n\n3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:34.920\n Right.\n\n3:01:34.920 --> 3:01:35.960\n Right, it's an important distinction\n\n3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:40.040\n because when I'm training and when I'm competing,\n\n3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:43.600\n like I understand that I take risks\n\n3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:44.980\n and I accept those consequences.\n\n3:01:44.980 --> 3:01:46.600\n That's why I take them.\n\n3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:48.460\n That's a consequence.\n\n3:01:48.460 --> 3:01:51.060\n That's not him being the better judo player\n\n3:01:51.060 --> 3:01:54.620\n that dominated a match and I didn't have an answer\n\n3:01:54.620 --> 3:01:56.060\n and then he threw me.\n\n3:01:56.060 --> 3:01:58.220\n Then I would be a little upset.\n\n3:01:58.220 --> 3:02:00.400\n Like when you're tired and somebody's coming at you\n\n3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:02.840\n and like, you can't do anything about it,\n\n3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:04.040\n that's a shitty feeling.\n\n3:02:04.040 --> 3:02:04.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:05.780\n You know?\n\n3:02:05.780 --> 3:02:06.620\n And that wasn't this.\n\n3:02:06.620 --> 3:02:08.800\n And that wasn't this.\n\n3:02:08.800 --> 3:02:12.960\n Like I accept losing when it's my fault.\n\n3:02:14.140 --> 3:02:16.060\n Well, that was a hell of a story, man.\n\n3:02:16.060 --> 3:02:21.060\n So from 2008, 2012, just the sheer number of injuries,\n\n3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:26.740\n the weight cuts, all of that, the wanting to quit,\n\n3:02:26.740 --> 3:02:30.980\n the doubts, I'm sure you did not get,\n\n3:02:30.980 --> 3:02:33.520\n like the fans probably started disappearing\n\n3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:35.700\n somewhere between the second and the third Olympics.\n\n3:02:35.700 --> 3:02:37.860\n Like the support from.\n\n3:02:37.860 --> 3:02:38.700\n It did.\n\n3:02:38.700 --> 3:02:42.560\n Judo within the United States and just everybody, you know.\n\n3:02:42.560 --> 3:02:47.360\n The USOC tried to cut all my funding in 2015 and said,\n\n3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:48.600\n nah, you're too old.\n\n3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:49.680\n Yeah.\n\n3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:52.200\n So through all of that, to win the medal,\n\n3:02:52.200 --> 3:02:55.080\n I mean, that's what the Olympics is about.\n\n3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:57.800\n Is there some, like when you look back,\n\n3:02:57.800 --> 3:02:59.580\n does that seem like another person?\n\n3:02:59.580 --> 3:03:01.360\n Is this like another lifetime ago?\n\n3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.480\n Or like, that's a hell of an accomplishment.\n\n3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:05.380\n How do you feel about the whole thing?\n\n3:03:06.960 --> 3:03:11.200\n It's an interesting kind of predicament\n\n3:03:11.200 --> 3:03:13.400\n because there's like those cookie cutter answers\n\n3:03:13.400 --> 3:03:15.720\n about how proud you are and how grateful you are,\n\n3:03:15.720 --> 3:03:20.200\n but at the end of the day, it's not who you are.\n\n3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:24.880\n So that skillset and that mentality that,\n\n3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:29.160\n you know, it took to accomplish that, that's who you are.\n\n3:03:29.160 --> 3:03:34.160\n And so this was just a stepping stone in who I am.\n\n3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:37.180\n So it's in the past to me.\n\n3:03:37.180 --> 3:03:39.540\n Like there's no shrine in my house\n\n3:03:39.540 --> 3:03:41.720\n that has like an Olympic medal in it.\n\n3:03:41.720 --> 3:03:44.680\n I can't even remember the last time I looked at it.\n\n3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:47.700\n So you're saying like the, all the stories,\n\n3:03:47.700 --> 3:03:49.640\n the skills along the way,\n\n3:03:49.640 --> 3:03:53.040\n that's like you right now sitting here is the shrine.\n\n3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:53.880\n Yeah.\n\n3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:56.300\n The who you become along the journey\n\n3:03:56.300 --> 3:03:59.320\n is really what the prize is, right?\n\n3:03:59.320 --> 3:04:02.840\n Like when you think about any of them,\n\n3:04:02.840 --> 3:04:05.520\n most of the people that, you know,\n\n3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:08.220\n go through that depression after the games,\n\n3:04:08.220 --> 3:04:10.920\n it's because that is their shrine.\n\n3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:13.080\n Like that is who they've identified as.\n\n3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:16.280\n That is who they've told the world, the community,\n\n3:04:16.280 --> 3:04:19.600\n their friends, their family, that's how they've identified.\n\n3:04:20.580 --> 3:04:23.220\n I've identified as the person who perseveres,\n\n3:04:23.220 --> 3:04:26.140\n overcomes and accepts challenges.\n\n3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:32.160\n So like I, all those things are just like, you know,\n\n3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:33.920\n putting a suitcase off to the side\n\n3:04:33.920 --> 3:04:36.620\n and I'm onto the next great chapter thing\n\n3:04:36.620 --> 3:04:38.280\n that I'm trying to do.\n\n3:04:38.280 --> 3:04:43.280\n And it's both sad and cool that very few people\n\n3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:47.060\n in the world get to experience what it's like to be you.\n\n3:04:47.060 --> 3:04:51.340\n I mean, this level of having gone through that journey.\n\n3:04:52.520 --> 3:04:54.220\n Everyone has the opportunity to.\n\n3:04:56.160 --> 3:04:58.720\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n3:04:58.720 --> 3:05:03.440\n I mean, I've done a few difficult things in my life,\n\n3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:07.120\n but I gotta tell you, weight cuts and sauna.\n\n3:05:07.120 --> 3:05:09.840\n And I would tell people right now who are listening,\n\n3:05:09.840 --> 3:05:12.080\n like, don't go through that.\n\n3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.320\n And I think a lot of wrestlers, a lot of young judo players,\n\n3:05:16.320 --> 3:05:19.560\n a lot of young, like just combat sports people\n\n3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:22.140\n where weight classes are a thing,\n\n3:05:23.840 --> 3:05:25.560\n they almost take a sense of pride.\n\n3:05:25.560 --> 3:05:27.400\n Like when I hear them talking about like,\n\n3:05:27.400 --> 3:05:29.360\n oh, how much weight do you have to cut?\n\n3:05:29.360 --> 3:05:30.640\n If you have to cut a pound more,\n\n3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:33.040\n it's like you've accomplished more, like you're tougher.\n\n3:05:33.040 --> 3:05:33.880\n Yeah.\n\n3:05:33.880 --> 3:05:35.040\n Like you're not.\n\n3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:37.420\n Like there's no trophies for that.\n\n3:05:38.440 --> 3:05:41.140\n You, whatever the reason, had a job to do\n\n3:05:41.140 --> 3:05:44.640\n and you got it done and that is truly inspiring,\n\n3:05:44.640 --> 3:05:46.280\n no matter how hard.\n\n3:05:46.280 --> 3:05:49.960\n That there's a big deep lesson to learn from that.\n\n3:05:49.960 --> 3:05:51.600\n Then you start getting to the specifics\n\n3:05:51.600 --> 3:05:53.280\n of whether you should weight cut or not.\n\n3:05:53.280 --> 3:05:57.040\n But if we don't, then most of the great things we have\n\n3:05:57.040 --> 3:05:58.800\n in this world, we wouldn't have.\n\n3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:00.680\n The reason we have many of the great things\n\n3:06:00.680 --> 3:06:02.900\n is because people did that weight cut.\n\n3:06:02.900 --> 3:06:04.480\n The equivalent of the weight cut\n\n3:06:04.480 --> 3:06:06.480\n for whatever the discipline, man.\n\n3:06:06.480 --> 3:06:10.040\n There's a difference between having to do it\n\n3:06:10.040 --> 3:06:12.600\n because you have to and you get through it,\n\n3:06:12.600 --> 3:06:15.800\n then setting yourself up to do that\n\n3:06:15.800 --> 3:06:18.620\n because you think it's the cool thing\n\n3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:20.240\n or the thing you're supposed to be doing\n\n3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:22.280\n in order to be successful.\n\n3:06:22.280 --> 3:06:25.640\n There are plenty of like two time Olympic medalist.\n\n3:06:25.640 --> 3:06:28.280\n I probably could have been a two time Olympic medalist\n\n3:06:28.280 --> 3:06:30.520\n had I not cut that much weight.\n\n3:06:30.520 --> 3:06:32.720\n I probably would have multiple world medals\n\n3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:33.960\n had I not cut that much weight\n\n3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:36.800\n because my body wouldn't have been that broken.\n\n3:06:36.800 --> 3:06:38.140\n There's always the other side of it.\n\n3:06:38.140 --> 3:06:40.320\n So just when you're looking at it,\n\n3:06:40.320 --> 3:06:43.720\n like I just hear it in like young kids,\n\n3:06:43.720 --> 3:06:45.800\n even some of my own, like when you hear them talk\n\n3:06:45.800 --> 3:06:47.920\n about like where their weight's at,\n\n3:06:47.920 --> 3:06:49.480\n they almost take a sense of pride\n\n3:06:49.480 --> 3:06:51.200\n on how much they have to lose\n\n3:06:51.200 --> 3:06:53.540\n because they hear stories like this.\n\n3:06:53.540 --> 3:06:56.000\n And it's like, that's not the takeaway.\n\n3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:59.040\n I did it because I had to.\n\n3:06:59.040 --> 3:07:01.560\n I was put in a situation where like,\n\n3:07:01.560 --> 3:07:03.040\n I may not have gone to this game\n\n3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:04.440\n had I moved up to 90 kilos\n\n3:07:04.440 --> 3:07:07.800\n because I wouldn't have had time to grow into the division.\n\n3:07:07.800 --> 3:07:09.080\n And then you get the job done.\n\n3:07:09.080 --> 3:07:10.160\n And then you get the job done.\n\n3:07:10.160 --> 3:07:14.280\n You're right, there's a very important difference.\n\n3:07:14.280 --> 3:07:16.840\n And that's also with sleep.\n\n3:07:16.840 --> 3:07:18.560\n That's what people talk to me about.\n\n3:07:18.560 --> 3:07:21.760\n There should not be any glorification of not sleeping.\n\n3:07:21.760 --> 3:07:24.820\n There should not be a glorification of cutting weight.\n\n3:07:24.820 --> 3:07:28.800\n But if that's on the way to your,\n\n3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:31.560\n whatever is that fire inside you\n\n3:07:31.560 --> 3:07:35.140\n that you know needs to get done, like the job at hand,\n\n3:07:35.140 --> 3:07:37.960\n if you need to sacrifice in some of those ways,\n\n3:07:37.960 --> 3:07:39.560\n you get the job done.\n\n3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:42.760\n Yeah, and the weight cut is an interesting one\n\n3:07:42.760 --> 3:07:43.760\n because it's different.\n\n3:07:43.760 --> 3:07:46.300\n I mean, you could speak to this.\n\n3:07:46.300 --> 3:07:47.600\n There's different sports\n\n3:07:47.600 --> 3:07:50.320\n in which the weight is more important than others.\n\n3:07:50.320 --> 3:07:52.840\n And there's different levels to this game.\n\n3:07:52.840 --> 3:07:54.960\n I think at the level you operated in,\n\n3:07:54.960 --> 3:07:57.280\n that was probably essential.\n\n3:07:57.280 --> 3:07:59.560\n Like there's huge games changed completely\n\n3:07:59.560 --> 3:08:01.480\n from 81 kg to 90 kg.\n\n3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:02.980\n It's a huge weight jump.\n\n3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:05.820\n It's, first of all, it's weight, but then the strategy,\n\n3:08:05.820 --> 3:08:07.600\n it's like so much changes the height\n\n3:08:07.600 --> 3:08:08.560\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n3:08:08.560 --> 3:08:11.060\n The physical, like people don't understand it,\n\n3:08:11.060 --> 3:08:14.040\n but the physical size of a 90 kilo judo player\n\n3:08:14.040 --> 3:08:17.320\n versus the physical size of an 81 kilo judo player,\n\n3:08:17.320 --> 3:08:19.160\n it's like putting a human in a human.\n\n3:08:19.160 --> 3:08:20.680\n Like there's enough space.\n\n3:08:20.680 --> 3:08:23.820\n That's not like, you could stand next to your friend\n\n3:08:23.820 --> 3:08:25.800\n who's 180 pounds and you could be 160\n\n3:08:25.800 --> 3:08:27.160\n and you guys could look identical.\n\n3:08:27.160 --> 3:08:28.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:30.040\n It is different when both the 90 kilo,\n\n3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:33.720\n 100 kilo and 81 kilo both have 6% body fat\n\n3:08:33.720 --> 3:08:35.920\n and they're cutting into the class.\n\n3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:38.720\n And it always feels like there's more variety at 90 kilo\n\n3:08:38.720 --> 3:08:40.440\n because some of them are lanky and tall.\n\n3:08:40.440 --> 3:08:42.960\n Yeah, some are short and stocky.\n\n3:08:42.960 --> 3:08:45.560\n It's like 81 is more uniform, which I,\n\n3:08:45.560 --> 3:08:48.080\n but then the flip side of that is the,\n\n3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:50.080\n this is what I like in jiu jitsu, again,\n\n3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:53.360\n amateur competing against bigger guys.\n\n3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:54.320\n Like I love that more.\n\n3:08:54.320 --> 3:08:56.760\n I like cutting weight just so I'm slim.\n\n3:08:56.760 --> 3:08:57.800\n Like that's when I feel the best\n\n3:08:57.800 --> 3:08:59.480\n with the same thing that you mentioned.\n\n3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:03.560\n But like, I love going against 200, 220 that.\n\n3:09:03.560 --> 3:09:04.880\n Because in jiu jitsu,\n\n3:09:04.880 --> 3:09:08.440\n the weight doesn't get amplified in the sport.\n\n3:09:08.440 --> 3:09:10.880\n Like the weight is just the weight, right?\n\n3:09:10.880 --> 3:09:15.880\n If you can leg press 220 and you can bench 220,\n\n3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:19.720\n then yeah, you can train with a guy who's 220.\n\n3:09:19.720 --> 3:09:20.680\n That's easy.\n\n3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:22.040\n They're not gonna hurt you.\n\n3:09:22.040 --> 3:09:25.040\n And I mean, there is a truth that,\n\n3:09:25.040 --> 3:09:27.520\n lightweights and middleweights in jiu jitsu\n\n3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:29.600\n and the same is true for judo.\n\n3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:31.240\n It's just like a lot more of them.\n\n3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:32.840\n That means if you wanna be,\n\n3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:37.280\n you're just competing at a higher level.\n\n3:09:37.280 --> 3:09:40.440\n So like, there's much more variety of games.\n\n3:09:40.440 --> 3:09:41.720\n The level is much higher.\n\n3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:43.880\n So you're taking on a bigger challenge,\n\n3:09:43.880 --> 3:09:47.440\n even if you're like, have a weight advantage.\n\n3:09:47.440 --> 3:09:49.840\n So those are all decisions you have to kind of make.\n\n3:09:49.840 --> 3:09:51.280\n And certainly in jiu jitsu,\n\n3:09:51.280 --> 3:09:52.760\n people that are weight cutting are silly.\n\n3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:55.200\n I mean, that's the natural beginner thing to do\n\n3:09:55.200 --> 3:09:58.840\n is to feel the way the nervousness\n\n3:09:58.840 --> 3:10:01.120\n about competition expresses itself\n\n3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:04.920\n is through the desire to be as light as possible,\n\n3:10:04.920 --> 3:10:07.840\n which is the totally wrong desire to have.\n\n3:10:07.840 --> 3:10:11.560\n Right, like when you look at me now,\n\n3:10:11.560 --> 3:10:15.400\n I'm probably like 230, right?\n\n3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:18.000\n But I probably have the strength\n\n3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:21.880\n of a 70 kilo judo player, right?\n\n3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:24.360\n The weight doesn't really do much.\n\n3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:27.440\n Yeah, I mean, you have the same thing with wrestling.\n\n3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:30.200\n The skinny guys, the skinny you\n\n3:10:30.200 --> 3:10:31.640\n that we're looking at there,\n\n3:10:31.640 --> 3:10:34.960\n just the amount of power in that person is fascinating.\n\n3:10:34.960 --> 3:10:35.880\n Because it doesn't look like,\n\n3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:38.240\n you have some muscle, but it doesn't look,\n\n3:10:38.240 --> 3:10:40.480\n but I've felt the power of some of those people.\n\n3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:42.280\n Yeah, it's scary.\n\n3:10:42.280 --> 3:10:44.640\n Yeah, it's different.\n\n3:10:44.640 --> 3:10:46.840\n That's the best way I can describe it is like scary.\n\n3:10:46.840 --> 3:10:49.640\n It's like, oh shit, again, it's the food chain.\n\n3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:52.680\n You're not at the top of the food chain.\n\n3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:54.040\n That's the natural feeling\n\n3:10:54.040 --> 3:10:56.480\n when you go with some judo people.\n\n3:10:56.480 --> 3:10:58.920\n What's your sense about this recent Olympics?\n\n3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:02.000\n What stands out to you as,\n\n3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:05.960\n so like Teddy Rene who was on a big run for a long time,\n\n3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:08.240\n many consider him to be one of the greatest judo players\n\n3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:12.880\n of all time, two time Olympic gold medalist\n\n3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.880\n and two time Olympic bronze medalist of four Olympics.\n\n3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:19.840\n Not counting like team stuff,\n\n3:11:19.840 --> 3:11:24.600\n just doing individual and then like 10 time world champ.\n\n3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:26.320\n Yeah, I'm not sure how they're gonna catalog\n\n3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:27.880\n that team event.\n\n3:11:27.880 --> 3:11:29.880\n Like are they all technically Olympic champions\n\n3:11:29.880 --> 3:11:32.040\n or is France an Olympic champion?\n\n3:11:32.040 --> 3:11:33.840\n No, they're all technically Olympic champions,\n\n3:11:33.840 --> 3:11:35.760\n but I'm gonna ignore that.\n\n3:11:35.760 --> 3:11:37.560\n Is that how they're gonna classify it now?\n\n3:11:37.560 --> 3:11:40.160\n According, oh, sorry, according to Wikipedia,\n\n3:11:40.160 --> 3:11:41.960\n like according to the internet.\n\n3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:43.960\n I don't know, according to IGF or whatever.\n\n3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:47.640\n Because some of those players never won a match.\n\n3:11:47.640 --> 3:11:49.640\n They just filled a spot.\n\n3:11:49.640 --> 3:11:52.120\n Oh, that's even a starker example.\n\n3:11:52.120 --> 3:11:53.880\n Oh, that's sad.\n\n3:11:53.880 --> 3:11:55.640\n You know, they lost in the individual\n\n3:11:55.640 --> 3:11:57.880\n and then they also lost in the team.\n\n3:11:57.880 --> 3:11:59.720\n And so.\n\n3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:03.320\n Well, it's interesting because in the case of Teddy,\n\n3:12:04.640 --> 3:12:08.720\n he was important to the win against Japan in this Olympics.\n\n3:12:08.720 --> 3:12:11.200\n So like in the team event.\n\n3:12:11.200 --> 3:12:14.960\n So like, I feel like you should put that in the equation\n\n3:12:14.960 --> 3:12:16.880\n to say who won gold, right?\n\n3:12:16.880 --> 3:12:20.280\n It does feel like he won gold in the team\n\n3:12:20.280 --> 3:12:21.880\n because he carried the team.\n\n3:12:21.880 --> 3:12:25.480\n Well, you have like Nomura at 60 kilos from Japan,\n\n3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:28.200\n three time Olympic gold medalist, no team event.\n\n3:12:29.160 --> 3:12:30.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:33.800\n Are you gonna weigh Teddy's team event?\n\n3:12:33.800 --> 3:12:35.800\n No, no, we're not arguing this, of course.\n\n3:12:35.800 --> 3:12:37.960\n No, I'm just wondering how like the IGF,\n\n3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:40.360\n like when you look at a player stat,\n\n3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.280\n is it gonna be like team gold medal for the Olympics\n\n3:12:44.280 --> 3:12:47.040\n versus like their own personal gold medal?\n\n3:12:47.040 --> 3:12:51.600\n Yeah, I think in sports, we have to be brutally honest.\n\n3:12:51.600 --> 3:12:55.400\n And I think, hopefully this doesn't piss off people.\n\n3:12:55.400 --> 3:12:56.240\n I hope it does.\n\n3:12:56.240 --> 3:12:59.160\n But judo is an individual sport.\n\n3:12:59.160 --> 3:13:01.600\n It's honestly just that one athlete,\n\n3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:04.160\n maybe the athlete and coach, right?\n\n3:13:04.160 --> 3:13:06.120\n If you look at the big, big picture,\n\n3:13:06.120 --> 3:13:08.920\n but there's no team in judo.\n\n3:13:08.920 --> 3:13:10.800\n That's the beauty of combat sports.\n\n3:13:10.800 --> 3:13:12.560\n That's the honesty of it.\n\n3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:16.160\n That's the brutality of losing to another human being\n\n3:13:16.160 --> 3:13:17.400\n in a combat sport.\n\n3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:20.480\n That's why it's so damn embarrassing when you get slammed\n\n3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:23.280\n is because it's like, there's no team\n\n3:13:23.280 --> 3:13:26.840\n to like carry some of that responsibility.\n\n3:13:26.840 --> 3:13:28.960\n It's all on you and you suck.\n\n3:13:28.960 --> 3:13:30.240\n That's why you lost.\n\n3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:31.360\n There's that weight.\n\n3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:32.920\n And that's why it's like magical.\n\n3:13:32.920 --> 3:13:34.760\n It's not like soccer.\n\n3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:37.440\n It's not like basketball.\n\n3:13:37.440 --> 3:13:38.760\n Yeah, I couldn't play team sports\n\n3:13:38.760 --> 3:13:40.560\n because if one of my teammates\n\n3:13:40.560 --> 3:13:42.440\n wasn't doing their job correctly,\n\n3:13:42.440 --> 3:13:44.400\n I would go play their position.\n\n3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:45.560\n I'm gonna do it better than you.\n\n3:13:45.560 --> 3:13:46.720\n Yeah, but that, you know,\n\n3:13:46.720 --> 3:13:48.960\n some of the greatest leaders of teams also do that.\n\n3:13:48.960 --> 3:13:50.320\n Michael Jordan is like that, right?\n\n3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:54.280\n I mean, it's like with your actions,\n\n3:13:54.280 --> 3:13:57.800\n you raised the level for everybody.\n\n3:13:57.800 --> 3:13:59.320\n Like excellence is expected\n\n3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:00.920\n and therefore everybody needs to step up.\n\n3:14:00.920 --> 3:14:04.000\n So some of the greatest, I would say,\n\n3:14:04.000 --> 3:14:07.280\n team leaders are individualists at heart.\n\n3:14:07.280 --> 3:14:08.120\n But it's okay.\n\n3:14:08.120 --> 3:14:10.000\n So Teddy, I think 10 time world champion,\n\n3:14:10.000 --> 3:14:13.280\n non team, regular.\n\n3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:14.120\n It's a big number,\n\n3:14:14.120 --> 3:14:16.520\n but I think he has some like open weight categories in there.\n\n3:14:16.520 --> 3:14:17.720\n Open weight, right, right.\n\n3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:19.520\n I mean, you can count those, right?\n\n3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:21.040\n I mean, that's interesting.\n\n3:14:21.040 --> 3:14:22.840\n It's the same division twice.\n\n3:14:22.840 --> 3:14:23.920\n It's the same division twice.\n\n3:14:23.920 --> 3:14:24.760\n That's right.\n\n3:14:24.760 --> 3:14:25.600\n One day after another.\n\n3:14:25.600 --> 3:14:26.440\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n3:14:26.440 --> 3:14:28.840\n I don't know if I wanna count that, yeah.\n\n3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:30.840\n Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons\n\n3:14:30.840 --> 3:14:35.200\n people don't usually put heavyweights in judo\n\n3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:37.800\n as like the greatest of all time,\n\n3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:40.080\n because the level of competition is lower.\n\n3:14:40.080 --> 3:14:40.920\n Yes.\n\n3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:44.640\n But anyway, he did lose in this match\n\n3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:49.640\n to a young Russian, Tamerlan Bashev.\n\n3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:53.800\n Match also not on the internet.\n\n3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:55.160\n Thank you Olympics.\n\n3:14:55.160 --> 3:14:58.200\n I am definitely going to go on some rants on the internet.\n\n3:14:58.200 --> 3:14:59.560\n I love it.\n\n3:14:59.560 --> 3:15:01.440\n As a fan of Olympics,\n\n3:15:01.440 --> 3:15:05.240\n I feel like this definitely needs to change moving forward.\n\n3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:07.400\n Like every single major Olympic event,\n\n3:15:07.400 --> 3:15:10.120\n I also like random sports like weightlifting,\n\n3:15:10.120 --> 3:15:11.760\n even though I don't do Olympic weightlifting.\n\n3:15:11.760 --> 3:15:12.800\n It's fun just to watch.\n\n3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:16.760\n Fun to watch such high level of excellence.\n\n3:15:16.760 --> 3:15:20.560\n And the fact that we can't just fricking watch the full,\n\n3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:23.880\n like each nicely categorized event is really heartbreaking\n\n3:15:23.880 --> 3:15:26.240\n in judo, in Olympic weightlifting,\n\n3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:28.600\n in track and gymnastics, all of that.\n\n3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:32.320\n Anyway, so Teddy lost.\n\n3:15:32.320 --> 3:15:33.960\n I mean, does that stand out to you?\n\n3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:35.800\n If you were to like recap the things\n\n3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:37.520\n that you remember from this Olympics.\n\n3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:39.440\n I picked him losing already.\n\n3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:41.200\n Like in my predictions.\n\n3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:42.560\n Lose which, where?\n\n3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:44.760\n That match or just in general somewhere?\n\n3:15:44.760 --> 3:15:45.600\n In the final.\n\n3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:46.600\n In the final, you thought.\n\n3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:48.440\n Yeah, final or was it semi?\n\n3:15:48.440 --> 3:15:49.640\n When I looked at his draw\n\n3:15:49.640 --> 3:15:52.760\n because he decided not to compete throughout the quad\n\n3:15:52.760 --> 3:15:54.760\n and do like the bare minimum to go,\n\n3:15:56.400 --> 3:15:57.520\n because of his age,\n\n3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:01.320\n I didn't think he would have enough energy\n\n3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:04.800\n to battle his way through the draw that he had.\n\n3:16:04.800 --> 3:16:06.400\n And sure enough, he didn't.\n\n3:16:06.400 --> 3:16:07.800\n He felt earlier than I thought,\n\n3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:12.800\n but he's not the young athletic person he used to be.\n\n3:16:13.400 --> 3:16:16.400\n And when they changed the rules to judo,\n\n3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:18.160\n they allowed people to take people\n\n3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:20.560\n into really, really deep waters,\n\n3:16:21.400 --> 3:16:22.760\n which you saw at this Olympics,\n\n3:16:22.760 --> 3:16:27.760\n which did it ruin the sport or did it not?\n\n3:16:27.960 --> 3:16:30.160\n Like, I'm not sure,\n\n3:16:30.160 --> 3:16:32.240\n but it was definitely difficult to watch.\n\n3:16:32.240 --> 3:16:35.440\n Would you put him at the greatest of all time\n\n3:16:35.440 --> 3:16:36.680\n or asked another way,\n\n3:16:36.680 --> 3:16:38.440\n like who do you think is the greatest judo player\n\n3:16:38.440 --> 3:16:39.800\n of all time?\n\n3:16:39.800 --> 3:16:42.840\n He's definitely not the greatest judo player,\n\n3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:45.560\n but he's definitely the best competitor.\n\n3:16:45.560 --> 3:16:48.160\n What's the difference in judo player and competitor?\n\n3:16:48.160 --> 3:16:52.600\n There's an ability to like do the act of judo\n\n3:16:52.600 --> 3:16:55.960\n of like throwing, pinning, arm locking\n\n3:16:55.960 --> 3:16:58.720\n versus can you win a judo match?\n\n3:16:58.720 --> 3:17:02.640\n Right, like when you look at somebody like Nomura\n\n3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:05.480\n who like threw everyone he fought,\n\n3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:09.040\n threw three Olympics, multiple world championships,\n\n3:17:09.040 --> 3:17:12.960\n multiple things, like that's a pure judo player.\n\n3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:14.640\n In the essence of judo,\n\n3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:16.480\n he can throw, pin or arm lock\n\n3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:19.480\n just about anybody he steps on the mat with during his time.\n\n3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:25.440\n Teddy tended to, when you look at his judo,\n\n3:17:25.440 --> 3:17:27.320\n because of his size,\n\n3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:30.280\n again, it's just because he's in the heavyweight category,\n\n3:17:30.280 --> 3:17:33.280\n he was so much bigger, so much stronger,\n\n3:17:34.280 --> 3:17:35.920\n people just couldn't handle it.\n\n3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:38.880\n And you would see really good judo players just break.\n\n3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:41.960\n Like they could hang in there for a little bit,\n\n3:17:41.960 --> 3:17:45.160\n but eventually his size, like you can't control that weight.\n\n3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:46.120\n Weight moves weight.\n\n3:17:46.120 --> 3:17:48.040\n And when you have to use all your strength\n\n3:17:48.040 --> 3:17:51.560\n to keep him upright and off of you,\n\n3:17:51.560 --> 3:17:52.760\n your muscles just give out\n\n3:17:52.760 --> 3:17:55.800\n because you don't have somebody of that stature\n\n3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:59.040\n and that skill to train with, to train those muscles.\n\n3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:04.040\n So you're thinking more like those 73, 81, 90 kg people\n\n3:18:04.160 --> 3:18:08.160\n that just stand in the pocket and just give everything.\n\n3:18:08.160 --> 3:18:11.120\n Like what comes to my mind is like a Koga.\n\n3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:11.960\n Koga.\n\n3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:14.200\n You know, a Nomura who's a 60 kilo guy,\n\n3:18:14.200 --> 3:18:16.560\n but again, like his dynamics\n\n3:18:16.560 --> 3:18:20.600\n and how long he was dominant for, like it just.\n\n3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:24.840\n Do you put value to like epic throws,\n\n3:18:24.840 --> 3:18:28.040\n like singular moments of greatness?\n\n3:18:28.040 --> 3:18:31.760\n If it's against a noteworthy player\n\n3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:34.160\n in a noteworthy position.\n\n3:18:34.160 --> 3:18:36.840\n There are a lot of highlights of people\n\n3:18:36.840 --> 3:18:38.440\n that are good judo players,\n\n3:18:38.440 --> 3:18:41.120\n but their highlights are of, you know,\n\n3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:43.960\n scrubs on the IJF circuit.\n\n3:18:43.960 --> 3:18:44.800\n Right.\n\n3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:47.240\n It's like, great, the Japanese guy threw the guy\n\n3:18:47.240 --> 3:18:51.680\n from, you know, Senegal free poem.\n\n3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:52.520\n Great.\n\n3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:53.800\n We kind of expected that.\n\n3:18:53.800 --> 3:18:54.920\n You took the world number one\n\n3:18:54.920 --> 3:18:57.840\n against the 330th person in the world.\n\n3:18:57.840 --> 3:18:59.360\n What'd you think was gonna happen?\n\n3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:01.920\n Like when I see those highlights like thrown around\n\n3:19:01.920 --> 3:19:05.800\n like social media, I'm like, that's not a highlight.\n\n3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:07.760\n They might as well have just been at the dojo\n\n3:19:07.760 --> 3:19:09.440\n like practice and throws.\n\n3:19:09.440 --> 3:19:12.520\n If you look at the like top 10 list for judo,\n\n3:19:12.520 --> 3:19:15.560\n Kano always comes up, you know, as.\n\n3:19:15.560 --> 3:19:18.200\n But he's not somebody that I don't think\n\n3:19:18.200 --> 3:19:19.840\n his results are there,\n\n3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:23.640\n but you don't really know how he got there.\n\n3:19:23.640 --> 3:19:27.320\n So it's hard for me to like, I can't see his judo.\n\n3:19:27.320 --> 3:19:28.320\n So I'm not sure.\n\n3:19:28.320 --> 3:19:29.880\n Kano, by the way, is the founder of judo\n\n3:19:29.880 --> 3:19:30.720\n for people who don't,\n\n3:19:30.720 --> 3:19:32.480\n who are considered to be the founder of judo.\n\n3:19:32.480 --> 3:19:33.320\n Yeah.\n\n3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:35.080\n The sport evolves.\n\n3:19:35.080 --> 3:19:36.200\n The players that are like,\n\n3:19:36.200 --> 3:19:37.960\n if you took champions from the past\n\n3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:40.560\n and you fought them against the players of today,\n\n3:19:40.560 --> 3:19:43.000\n they're, it's not happening.\n\n3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:44.840\n And that goes with anything, right?\n\n3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:46.200\n So every time you think of like,\n\n3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:48.040\n who's the best of all time,\n\n3:19:48.040 --> 3:19:50.080\n it's probably somebody within a generation\n\n3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:51.640\n or two of today.\n\n3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:52.480\n Yeah.\n\n3:19:52.480 --> 3:19:55.520\n If I'm gonna pick my top three, let's say,\n\n3:19:55.520 --> 3:19:59.560\n top three, and I would go generationally speaking,\n\n3:19:59.560 --> 3:20:01.280\n I would pick Ono for today,\n\n3:20:02.760 --> 3:20:06.160\n probably Iliadis for like my timeframe,\n\n3:20:06.160 --> 3:20:09.800\n like the, from a developmental standpoint.\n\n3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:11.720\n And then I'd probably go Koga.\n\n3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:14.360\n And then before Koga, I'd probably go Nomura.\n\n3:20:14.360 --> 3:20:17.320\n As like the person of that generation\n\n3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:18.560\n that people like,\n\n3:20:20.320 --> 3:20:23.160\n as a whole in judo respected.\n\n3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:24.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:20:24.000 --> 3:20:25.120\n Well, in the case of,\n\n3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:27.280\n I wonder if people feared Koga.\n\n3:20:27.280 --> 3:20:28.240\n Yeah.\n\n3:20:28.240 --> 3:20:29.320\n Yeah?\n\n3:20:29.320 --> 3:20:32.280\n Like you're, that little guy's gonna get under you.\n\n3:20:32.280 --> 3:20:33.720\n And you're gonna go for a ride.\n\n3:20:33.720 --> 3:20:35.440\n You know, he was 78 kilos\n\n3:20:35.440 --> 3:20:37.160\n when he took second at the All Japan's,\n\n3:20:37.160 --> 3:20:38.920\n which is an open weight class.\n\n3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:39.800\n Yeah.\n\n3:20:39.800 --> 3:20:41.480\n You know, like he,\n\n3:20:41.480 --> 3:20:44.200\n he could throw down with anybody any weight class.\n\n3:20:44.200 --> 3:20:45.240\n He still went.\n\n3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:46.760\n He was one of the early people\n\n3:20:46.760 --> 3:20:49.360\n that planted the seed of judo,\n\n3:20:49.360 --> 3:20:50.200\n love of judo in you.\n\n3:20:50.200 --> 3:20:51.040\n It's like that.\n\n3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:51.880\n Yeah.\n\n3:20:51.880 --> 3:20:52.720\n And when I looked at him,\n\n3:20:52.720 --> 3:20:57.480\n like that was how like I wanted my judo to be portrayed.\n\n3:20:57.480 --> 3:20:58.920\n That style.\n\n3:20:58.920 --> 3:20:59.920\n Yeah.\n\n3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:02.360\n And then Iliadis, Iliadis, you just like,\n\n3:21:02.360 --> 3:21:04.560\n I mean, you have a similar attitude as him.\n\n3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:05.400\n So you just like the way he carries it.\n\n3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:06.760\n That's why we get along.\n\n3:21:09.400 --> 3:21:10.240\n You guys hang out.\n\n3:21:10.240 --> 3:21:12.200\n I mean, I'd love to see that conversation.\n\n3:21:12.200 --> 3:21:15.160\n I remember when we were talking about like his coaching,\n\n3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:17.880\n I was like, why didn't you take this team?\n\n3:21:17.880 --> 3:21:19.280\n Or like, why'd you pick this team?\n\n3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:21.480\n And he's like, I can't work with those people.\n\n3:21:21.480 --> 3:21:23.920\n Like those people are weak for children.\n\n3:21:23.920 --> 3:21:25.680\n Like they don't know how to train hard.\n\n3:21:25.680 --> 3:21:27.680\n I love that guy.\n\n3:21:27.680 --> 3:21:28.520\n What about Ono?\n\n3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:30.360\n Cause he was competing in this Olympics.\n\n3:21:30.360 --> 3:21:32.160\n He got gold in this Olympics, right?\n\n3:21:33.280 --> 3:21:34.120\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:34.120 --> 3:21:34.960\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:34.960 --> 3:21:36.040\n He lost in the team tournament though.\n\n3:21:36.040 --> 3:21:37.240\n I think he just didn't care.\n\n3:21:37.240 --> 3:21:38.080\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:38.080 --> 3:21:39.240\n He just really wanted to throw that guy.\n\n3:21:39.240 --> 3:21:41.000\n He like throws everybody.\n\n3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:41.840\n Yeah.\n\n3:21:41.840 --> 3:21:44.960\n So he's, he represents the thing you're mentioning.\n\n3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:49.200\n I signed up to the judo fanatics, best of Ono.\n\n3:21:49.200 --> 3:21:51.480\n Is there something that stands out to you about him\n\n3:21:51.480 --> 3:21:53.720\n that's especially you find beautiful,\n\n3:21:53.720 --> 3:21:56.200\n like, or powerful about his technique?\n\n3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:00.440\n His adaptability to the situations\n\n3:22:00.440 --> 3:22:05.080\n and understanding of like what needs to happen\n\n3:22:05.080 --> 3:22:07.200\n in order to throw these people.\n\n3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:10.360\n I specifically watched a match with his\n\n3:22:10.360 --> 3:22:13.560\n and I was going to do a breakdown video on it because.\n\n3:22:13.560 --> 3:22:15.160\n Is there a match, do you remember what it is?\n\n3:22:15.160 --> 3:22:20.160\n It's him versus Garvey of Hungary.\n\n3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:21.880\n Is he good at gripping?\n\n3:22:21.880 --> 3:22:24.080\n So we're watching the match against Hungary.\n\n3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:28.200\n So at the one minute, so right here, coming up.\n\n3:22:28.200 --> 3:22:29.920\n I've heard he's freakishly strong.\n\n3:22:29.920 --> 3:22:32.600\n I've never had the ability to train with him.\n\n3:22:32.600 --> 3:22:33.760\n So I'm not.\n\n3:22:33.760 --> 3:22:35.360\n Obviously he looks super skinny.\n\n3:22:36.880 --> 3:22:39.000\n But when you see him without his gi jacket on,\n\n3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:40.840\n like he's a jacked dude,\n\n3:22:41.720 --> 3:22:44.800\n which is uncharacteristic of a Japanese player\n\n3:22:44.800 --> 3:22:47.720\n from back in the day, in a way changed all that.\n\n3:22:47.720 --> 3:22:49.200\n He was like, we're going to get physical\n\n3:22:49.200 --> 3:22:50.560\n to compete with the Europeans.\n\n3:22:50.560 --> 3:22:52.160\n That's another one of the greats, right?\n\n3:22:52.160 --> 3:22:53.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:22:53.000 --> 3:22:54.520\n He doesn't get mentioned enough.\n\n3:23:01.400 --> 3:23:04.320\n And he's a righty here, yeah, okay.\n\n3:23:04.320 --> 3:23:06.280\n And this is where he started setting it up.\n\n3:23:06.280 --> 3:23:07.760\n It's like, you can see he was standing\n\n3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:10.120\n in like a left handed stance and then he changes.\n\n3:23:11.840 --> 3:23:16.720\n So he grips almost like a double sleeve,\n\n3:23:16.720 --> 3:23:17.560\n not a double sleeve.\n\n3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:18.400\n He holds the tricep.\n\n3:23:18.400 --> 3:23:19.240\n The tricep.\n\n3:23:19.240 --> 3:23:23.040\n And the front sleeve standing like a lefty.\n\n3:23:23.040 --> 3:23:24.720\n And no body grip.\n\n3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:27.080\n Just tricep and sleeve.\n\n3:23:27.080 --> 3:23:30.160\n And that was like the biggest whip\n\n3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:32.800\n and twist of a nutrimata I've ever seen.\n\n3:23:32.800 --> 3:23:35.400\n Yeah, he doesn't actually lift him off the floor.\n\n3:23:35.400 --> 3:23:39.440\n And if you look at it in like slow motion almost,\n\n3:23:42.240 --> 3:23:43.960\n yeah, let's, yeah, there we go.\n\n3:23:45.760 --> 3:23:48.920\n The Hungarian player was like 100% defense\n\n3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:51.600\n and he still did this, right?\n\n3:23:51.600 --> 3:23:54.920\n So right here, like press pause.\n\n3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:59.240\n This is like an identifier if you're trying\n\n3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:02.240\n to like learn judo and figure out how to set it up.\n\n3:24:02.240 --> 3:24:05.560\n Because knowing how to get to the point right before\n\n3:24:05.560 --> 3:24:08.480\n you pull the trigger is probably the most important.\n\n3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:10.680\n So when we watch this play out,\n\n3:24:10.680 --> 3:24:12.640\n what Ono's gonna do is he's gonna pivot\n\n3:24:12.640 --> 3:24:14.480\n off his right leg right here.\n\n3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:16.160\n He's gonna back step with his left\n\n3:24:16.160 --> 3:24:19.000\n and it's gonna pull Ungarvi's front leg\n\n3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:20.720\n all the way forward into what we would call\n\n3:24:20.720 --> 3:24:23.080\n like a neutral square stance.\n\n3:24:23.080 --> 3:24:25.200\n So he plants hard.\n\n3:24:25.200 --> 3:24:26.040\n And look at Ono.\n\n3:24:26.040 --> 3:24:27.160\n Oh, there's an interesting pull with the,\n\n3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:28.240\n oh no, it's not a tricep.\n\n3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:30.920\n He almost like, it starts with the tricep\n\n3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:32.680\n and he like collects the gear or something like that.\n\n3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:34.160\n But it's still above the elbow\n\n3:24:34.160 --> 3:24:36.320\n because you can see the bend, right?\n\n3:24:36.320 --> 3:24:38.600\n And right here, see how he never put,\n\n3:24:38.600 --> 3:24:39.800\n back it up a little bit.\n\n3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:43.720\n This is kind of like one of those things,\n\n3:24:43.720 --> 3:24:45.440\n yeah, pause it right there.\n\n3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:47.400\n So when he puts his right foot down,\n\n3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:50.600\n he's pulling so hard with his back\n\n3:24:50.600 --> 3:24:53.080\n that when Ono goes to put his left foot down,\n\n3:24:53.080 --> 3:24:55.040\n it never touches the mat.\n\n3:24:55.040 --> 3:24:57.400\n But by putting his left foot back,\n\n3:24:57.400 --> 3:24:59.680\n it actually pulls Ungarvi's foot forward.\n\n3:24:59.680 --> 3:25:02.360\n And so he's able to speed up his throw\n\n3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:04.800\n by just continuing that motion back,\n\n3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:07.840\n which what was supposed to have been a step\n\n3:25:07.840 --> 3:25:11.720\n turned out to just, in the middle of the action,\n\n3:25:11.720 --> 3:25:13.360\n he makes a split second decision\n\n3:25:13.360 --> 3:25:15.960\n before putting the foot down to just continue.\n\n3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:18.640\n Cause he recognizes that feel in his hands.\n\n3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:20.880\n And so it's like, it never, it's a swing.\n\n3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:22.800\n Like he never touches the ground with his left foot.\n\n3:25:22.800 --> 3:25:26.000\n It never started as like a big swing to a back step.\n\n3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:28.040\n He changed his mind partway through.\n\n3:25:28.040 --> 3:25:30.640\n So it's right there, he wants to take a step.\n\n3:25:30.640 --> 3:25:32.720\n And then he goes, nope, he's bringing that foot forward.\n\n3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:34.160\n I'm just going to go for it.\n\n3:25:34.160 --> 3:25:36.440\n Wait, is he full?\n\n3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:37.760\n Full air.\n\n3:25:37.760 --> 3:25:38.720\n Look at that.\n\n3:25:38.720 --> 3:25:39.560\n Boom, boom.\n\n3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:43.160\n And look at, if you go a few more steps forward right there,\n\n3:25:43.160 --> 3:25:46.920\n his hip is the same height as Ungarvi shoulder.\n\n3:25:48.120 --> 3:25:51.240\n Because he's leaning so far into the throw\n\n3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:53.000\n with his body weight.\n\n3:25:53.000 --> 3:25:56.240\n And he's allowing that tricep grip to rotate.\n\n3:25:56.240 --> 3:25:58.800\n That's going to draw Ungarvi forward.\n\n3:25:58.800 --> 3:26:01.160\n And now when you pause it right here,\n\n3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:03.440\n you think about the sheer physics\n\n3:26:03.440 --> 3:26:07.040\n to like get your body into this position.\n\n3:26:07.040 --> 3:26:09.160\n Jimmy and I were so like,\n\n3:26:09.160 --> 3:26:10.800\n when we saw this for the first time,\n\n3:26:10.800 --> 3:26:13.640\n we tried to just stand like that and we couldn't do it.\n\n3:26:13.640 --> 3:26:17.160\n His left foot is pointing straight ahead.\n\n3:26:17.160 --> 3:26:19.760\n His chest is perpendicular to that foot\n\n3:26:19.760 --> 3:26:21.320\n or parallel with it, right?\n\n3:26:21.320 --> 3:26:22.760\n And his head is by his foot.\n\n3:26:22.760 --> 3:26:23.600\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:25.520\n Is that only possible in the midst of a throw?\n\n3:26:25.520 --> 3:26:27.520\n Do you think he works on making like?\n\n3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:30.360\n I think he's done this particular throw,\n\n3:26:30.360 --> 3:26:33.560\n not this style of it, but Uchi Mata so much\n\n3:26:33.560 --> 3:26:37.440\n that his body has adapted to be able to do this.\n\n3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:38.920\n So when people are trying to learn\n\n3:26:38.920 --> 3:26:41.000\n and like break down videos,\n\n3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:45.040\n they don't understand like the power he has\n\n3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:48.560\n and what we call end range motion.\n\n3:26:48.560 --> 3:26:49.400\n Yeah, look at that.\n\n3:26:49.400 --> 3:26:52.360\n So like look at the full range of motion he takes, right?\n\n3:26:52.360 --> 3:26:53.200\n Yeah.\n\n3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:56.400\n His left foot swings all the way around\n\n3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:00.040\n and the torso starts like at three oclock\n\n3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:02.600\n and it goes all the way around\n\n3:27:02.600 --> 3:27:04.720\n like almost back to the three oclock.\n\n3:27:04.720 --> 3:27:05.560\n Yeah.\n\n3:27:05.560 --> 3:27:08.040\n Like, like what?\n\n3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:10.200\n And he never lifts his leg above his hip.\n\n3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:16.400\n And the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it.\n\n3:27:16.400 --> 3:27:17.560\n Yeah, look at that.\n\n3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:19.120\n Stayed on his feet.\n\n3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:19.960\n What's he doing?\n\n3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:24.480\n Is that a matter of pride or just?\n\n3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:26.520\n I think that's just habit.\n\n3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:29.760\n The way the forces work, like he can just stay up.\n\n3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:34.560\n That's one of the most beautiful throws I've ever seen.\n\n3:27:35.680 --> 3:27:39.640\n There's so much wrong with it, but it worked.\n\n3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:40.480\n It worked.\n\n3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:41.320\n Because when you think about,\n\n3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:42.640\n remember what we talked about the very beginning,\n\n3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:45.600\n like he's got to get his center of gravity under his.\n\n3:27:45.600 --> 3:27:47.200\n Well, here's one of the top players in the world\n\n3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:48.920\n throwing another top player in the world\n\n3:27:48.920 --> 3:27:51.240\n with his hip at that guy's shoulder height\n\n3:27:51.240 --> 3:27:54.400\n and it's still working, it's.\n\n3:27:55.320 --> 3:27:58.480\n Okay, so he, this generation, he could be the great.\n\n3:27:58.480 --> 3:27:59.320\n Yeah.\n\n3:27:59.320 --> 3:28:02.440\n And like he switched a lot of those details\n\n3:28:02.440 --> 3:28:03.960\n of the throw in the middle.\n\n3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:04.800\n In the middle.\n\n3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:07.160\n And that only is, that means he's probably what,\n\n3:28:07.160 --> 3:28:09.600\n like a hundred thousand times that throw has happened.\n\n3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:10.440\n Yeah.\n\n3:28:11.280 --> 3:28:12.880\n I saw you were into chess recently.\n\n3:28:12.880 --> 3:28:16.640\n So you're like me, a bit of a beginner in chess.\n\n3:28:16.640 --> 3:28:20.440\n You're part of launching the website Effective Chess.\n\n3:28:20.440 --> 3:28:23.000\n So I got to ask, maybe it's a personal question,\n\n3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:25.400\n but do you have advice to yourself\n\n3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:28.400\n and to other beginners in exploring chess\n\n3:28:28.400 --> 3:28:31.680\n of how to one, have fun and two, to start getting good?\n\n3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:35.360\n It's nice to see like Olympic caliber athlete\n\n3:28:35.360 --> 3:28:40.360\n take on a difficult task with a beginner's mind.\n\n3:28:40.600 --> 3:28:42.760\n So like, what's that process like?\n\n3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:47.760\n I'm a huge fan of just learning new things in general.\n\n3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:50.400\n Right, like when I left Judo,\n\n3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:55.400\n like I took a job as marketing for Fuji Sports\n\n3:28:55.520 --> 3:28:58.280\n and I was getting frustrated with designers.\n\n3:28:58.280 --> 3:29:00.760\n So I learned Photoshop.\n\n3:29:00.760 --> 3:29:02.600\n I also got angry with the photographer.\n\n3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:05.000\n So now I take all the photos too,\n\n3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:07.040\n just because I don't mind learning.\n\n3:29:07.040 --> 3:29:11.880\n I've spent my entire Judo career learning all the time,\n\n3:29:11.880 --> 3:29:13.120\n like adding new techniques,\n\n3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:16.560\n finding new ways, practicing, developing.\n\n3:29:16.560 --> 3:29:18.560\n And so when it comes to chess,\n\n3:29:18.560 --> 3:29:20.840\n I treat it just like I do anything else.\n\n3:29:20.840 --> 3:29:23.040\n I just stick to one plan\n\n3:29:23.040 --> 3:29:26.600\n and I learn all the ins and outs of that one plan.\n\n3:29:26.600 --> 3:29:29.520\n And then I develop another plan, right?\n\n3:29:29.520 --> 3:29:33.200\n Like I might practice like a London opening, for example,\n\n3:29:33.200 --> 3:29:35.800\n and just, I don't even care if I win or lose.\n\n3:29:35.800 --> 3:29:38.960\n I just wanna figure out how I'm gonna lose\n\n3:29:38.960 --> 3:29:40.520\n and then figure out how I'm gonna win.\n\n3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:43.840\n And once I know that position is now done,\n\n3:29:43.840 --> 3:29:46.400\n then I start with another position.\n\n3:29:46.400 --> 3:29:48.480\n And then once I figured out how I'm gonna lose\n\n3:29:48.480 --> 3:29:49.760\n and how I'm gonna win,\n\n3:29:49.760 --> 3:29:52.120\n the next thing I do is I don't go to a third.\n\n3:29:52.120 --> 3:29:54.360\n I figure out the bridge between the two.\n\n3:29:55.320 --> 3:29:57.120\n Like at what point during my openings\n\n3:29:57.120 --> 3:29:59.560\n can I transition back into this opening?\n\n3:29:59.560 --> 3:30:03.000\n Right, so like you have like some basic openings\n\n3:30:03.000 --> 3:30:04.640\n and you wanna see how they go wrong,\n\n3:30:04.640 --> 3:30:06.120\n how they go right, all the different ways.\n\n3:30:06.120 --> 3:30:09.480\n And then that starts to solidify a higher level concept\n\n3:30:09.480 --> 3:30:10.520\n of that particular opening\n\n3:30:10.520 --> 3:30:12.320\n and you start to stitch together the concepts.\n\n3:30:12.320 --> 3:30:13.440\n The concepts together,\n\n3:30:13.440 --> 3:30:15.600\n cause being able to go from one to another\n\n3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:19.600\n and then back and forth is part of the reasons\n\n3:30:19.600 --> 3:30:21.440\n why like I was successful at judo\n\n3:30:21.440 --> 3:30:25.240\n is just because everything I do,\n\n3:30:25.240 --> 3:30:27.680\n at some point it touches that spider web\n\n3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:30.740\n of like being able to get from one area to another.\n\n3:30:30.740 --> 3:30:32.480\n We refer to it as like a toolbox, right?\n\n3:30:32.480 --> 3:30:34.600\n You need more tools in your toolbox.\n\n3:30:34.600 --> 3:30:36.280\n But if you're always grabbing the wrong tool\n\n3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:40.320\n for that job, then you're just not gonna have success.\n\n3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:41.320\n I actually forgot to ask,\n\n3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:44.280\n you mentioned a few greatest chess players of all time\n\n3:30:44.280 --> 3:30:47.040\n and I noticed you didn't mention Vladimir Putin.\n\n3:30:47.040 --> 3:30:50.800\n I gotta ask you about his judo.\n\n3:30:50.800 --> 3:30:53.800\n Do you by chance know much about his judo?\n\n3:30:53.800 --> 3:30:58.320\n What do you think about a president of a major nation\n\n3:30:58.320 --> 3:30:59.680\n being a judo black belt?\n\n3:30:59.680 --> 3:31:03.080\n And I think from what I've seen, pretty good at it.\n\n3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:08.080\n I think it shows, you know, if he actually got it,\n\n3:31:09.240 --> 3:31:12.040\n like let's go with that premise of like he earned it.\n\n3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:14.320\n Right?\n\n3:31:14.320 --> 3:31:19.240\n That just shows like a level of like physical persistence\n\n3:31:19.240 --> 3:31:22.860\n and mental fortitude to be able to like,\n\n3:31:24.160 --> 3:31:26.120\n you know, take those beatings\n\n3:31:26.120 --> 3:31:29.240\n and just keep showing up until you've overcome\n\n3:31:29.240 --> 3:31:31.280\n and can now give those beatings.\n\n3:31:31.280 --> 3:31:34.360\n As you know, in Japan and Russia, you get it by just like,\n\n3:31:34.360 --> 3:31:36.440\n when you're young, it's easier to get a black belt\n\n3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:39.520\n when you're like, just go through a bunch of beatings\n\n3:31:39.520 --> 3:31:42.800\n for like 10 years in your teenage years.\n\n3:31:42.800 --> 3:31:47.800\n But there's also from it springs like a camaraderie.\n\n3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:51.520\n Like there's a definitely a brotherhood and sisterhood\n\n3:31:51.520 --> 3:31:55.900\n in terms of judo to where you're connected forever\n\n3:31:55.900 --> 3:31:57.520\n because of that.\n\n3:31:57.520 --> 3:31:59.380\n For many people, it's their childhood connection.\n\n3:31:59.380 --> 3:32:01.920\n You sort of leave judo, you know,\n\n3:32:01.920 --> 3:32:04.240\n in your twenties and your thirties, but that's always there.\n\n3:32:04.240 --> 3:32:05.480\n And the same is true with wrestling.\n\n3:32:05.480 --> 3:32:10.480\n So it's interesting to see him pay respect to that,\n\n3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:15.640\n like by going with the Russian national judo team.\n\n3:32:15.700 --> 3:32:18.320\n And I think he did, obviously they have to get thrown,\n\n3:32:18.320 --> 3:32:19.160\n right?\n\n3:32:19.160 --> 3:32:20.800\n But just, you can tell,\n\n3:32:20.800 --> 3:32:22.320\n and you probably could tell even better,\n\n3:32:22.320 --> 3:32:24.940\n but you can tell when a person moves in a way\n\n3:32:24.940 --> 3:32:28.280\n where you're like, okay, you've had like 10 years\n\n3:32:28.280 --> 3:32:31.480\n of beatings and you can tell the way they pull,\n\n3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:32.520\n the way they move.\n\n3:32:32.520 --> 3:32:36.720\n But I also like, in contrast to the US national team,\n\n3:32:36.720 --> 3:32:40.880\n or I don't even think there's a national team for US, right?\n\n3:32:40.880 --> 3:32:42.580\n It's the Pedro Judo center, right?\n\n3:32:44.720 --> 3:32:47.520\n That there is some, it's really cool\n\n3:32:47.520 --> 3:32:49.080\n when there's a camaraderie like that\n\n3:32:49.080 --> 3:32:52.600\n amongst the highest level Olympic caliber athletes in Russia.\n\n3:32:52.600 --> 3:32:54.840\n I suppose Japan might have similar kind of thing.\n\n3:32:54.840 --> 3:32:59.840\n And then you can have the system of people together\n\n3:33:00.640 --> 3:33:03.000\n and then you can have a strong coaching staff,\n\n3:33:03.000 --> 3:33:05.160\n not just like a coach, but a coaching staff.\n\n3:33:05.160 --> 3:33:07.200\n And then you can have the nation backing that staff.\n\n3:33:07.200 --> 3:33:09.040\n I mean, and then the result is like,\n\n3:33:09.040 --> 3:33:12.240\n you have some incredible level of judo emerge.\n\n3:33:14.080 --> 3:33:15.360\n Is there something you could say,\n\n3:33:15.360 --> 3:33:17.560\n we didn't talk much about Jimmy.\n\n3:33:17.560 --> 3:33:20.500\n I mean, he was a critical part of your just,\n\n3:33:20.500 --> 3:33:25.420\n like of your perseverance through all the,\n\n3:33:25.420 --> 3:33:27.220\n all that you had to go through.\n\n3:33:27.220 --> 3:33:28.820\n What did you learn from Jimmy?\n\n3:33:29.660 --> 3:33:32.660\n What are some impacts that he had on your life,\n\n3:33:32.660 --> 3:33:34.260\n both on the mat and off the mat?\n\n3:33:37.100 --> 3:33:41.860\n If we had to like put it down to like a very simple thing,\n\n3:33:41.860 --> 3:33:45.180\n he taught me how to win, right?\n\n3:33:45.180 --> 3:33:49.340\n It wasn't necessarily like the technical side of judo.\n\n3:33:49.340 --> 3:33:51.820\n Like we went over gripping, we went over this,\n\n3:33:51.820 --> 3:33:53.700\n we adapted that.\n\n3:33:53.700 --> 3:33:56.420\n But the real strength to Jimmy was like,\n\n3:33:56.420 --> 3:33:58.420\n he knows how to win.\n\n3:33:58.420 --> 3:34:00.700\n And most people think,\n\n3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:03.060\n well, if I get really good at this technique,\n\n3:34:03.060 --> 3:34:05.700\n I'll be able to throw people with it, not win.\n\n3:34:05.700 --> 3:34:09.520\n That is not how the world of sports works, right?\n\n3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:13.300\n Like I remember in one of my YouTube videos,\n\n3:34:13.300 --> 3:34:17.520\n I was doing a breakdown of a match from the Cuba Grand Prix\n\n3:34:17.520 --> 3:34:19.820\n where I was fighting a Mongolian guy.\n\n3:34:19.820 --> 3:34:22.220\n He's kicking the shit at me, I'm not gonna lie.\n\n3:34:22.220 --> 3:34:26.900\n Four minutes in, like he just throwing me like left\n\n3:34:26.900 --> 3:34:28.780\n and right, he was so fast.\n\n3:34:28.780 --> 3:34:31.180\n I felt like I just couldn't get to him.\n\n3:34:31.180 --> 3:34:34.580\n In the last 30 seconds, he changed.\n\n3:34:34.580 --> 3:34:38.620\n He started protecting his lead instead of continuing\n\n3:34:38.620 --> 3:34:41.900\n the fight the way the entire match was going in his favor.\n\n3:34:41.900 --> 3:34:44.500\n He made a mental shift and when he made that mental shift,\n\n3:34:44.500 --> 3:34:46.080\n I beat him.\n\n3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:49.300\n Because he didn't know how to win the fight.\n\n3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:54.300\n He can win exchanges, but he can't win the fight.\n\n3:34:54.300 --> 3:34:57.260\n So the last thing you wanna do is have to win\n\n3:34:57.260 --> 3:34:59.940\n every exchange in a match.\n\n3:34:59.940 --> 3:35:03.940\n You wanna know how to kick it into sixth gear.\n\n3:35:03.940 --> 3:35:06.180\n Like when to step off the gas,\n\n3:35:06.180 --> 3:35:08.060\n when to focus on gripping,\n\n3:35:08.060 --> 3:35:10.540\n when to attack, how often to attack,\n\n3:35:10.540 --> 3:35:12.720\n all those things like.\n\n3:35:12.720 --> 3:35:14.900\n And you've had those conversations with Jimmy like,\n\n3:35:14.900 --> 3:35:17.820\n this is not like how to stop trying to win every exchange,\n\n3:35:17.820 --> 3:35:18.660\n that kind of thing.\n\n3:35:18.660 --> 3:35:19.940\n And instead.\n\n3:35:19.940 --> 3:35:21.060\n Because I was a brawler before.\n\n3:35:21.060 --> 3:35:23.940\n I was like, if I threw you once, I'm throwing you again.\n\n3:35:23.940 --> 3:35:25.700\n And sometimes you get caught.\n\n3:35:25.700 --> 3:35:27.140\n Why would I do that?\n\n3:35:27.140 --> 3:35:28.940\n I'm already winning.\n\n3:35:28.940 --> 3:35:30.700\n What about like the mental side of the game,\n\n3:35:30.700 --> 3:35:32.900\n the preparation, all those things?\n\n3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:35.940\n One of the biggest things Jimmy brought to the forefront\n\n3:35:35.940 --> 3:35:37.660\n when it came to like the mental side\n\n3:35:37.660 --> 3:35:41.160\n was the visualization, right?\n\n3:35:41.160 --> 3:35:44.400\n And when I started visualizing myself winning,\n\n3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:46.700\n I started seeing more success.\n\n3:35:46.700 --> 3:35:49.420\n But once I started seeing more success,\n\n3:35:49.420 --> 3:35:52.820\n with the visualization also came self doubt.\n\n3:35:52.820 --> 3:35:57.820\n Because as I'm starting to picture myself like,\n\n3:35:59.200 --> 3:36:02.240\n I would picture myself before fighting Church's village,\n\n3:36:02.240 --> 3:36:05.300\n I'm gonna throw him with Koshiguruma and I can see it.\n\n3:36:05.300 --> 3:36:08.320\n And if I stand in the shoot for too long,\n\n3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:11.640\n you start to like, but what if he counters?\n\n3:36:11.640 --> 3:36:14.640\n Then you go, well, if he counters with this,\n\n3:36:14.640 --> 3:36:15.760\n I'm gonna counter with that.\n\n3:36:15.760 --> 3:36:18.040\n But you already let that doubt in.\n\n3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:20.620\n And then you start playing this like five step scenario,\n\n3:36:20.620 --> 3:36:22.200\n but you still come out on top.\n\n3:36:22.200 --> 3:36:26.400\n But all that doubt has like seeped into your mind, right?\n\n3:36:26.400 --> 3:36:29.320\n And a lot of people don't understand\n\n3:36:29.320 --> 3:36:31.900\n that that's a bad thing.\n\n3:36:31.900 --> 3:36:33.720\n You're still winning in your mind,\n\n3:36:33.720 --> 3:36:35.840\n but you're also doubting yourself in your mind.\n\n3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:38.920\n Yeah, once you let that doubt seep in,\n\n3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:40.580\n it's destructive.\n\n3:36:40.580 --> 3:36:44.680\n Yeah, and so I remember I was at the World Championships.\n\n3:36:44.680 --> 3:36:47.520\n I can't remember what year it was, but I was ready.\n\n3:36:47.520 --> 3:36:50.440\n Like I was healthy, I was ready to go.\n\n3:36:50.440 --> 3:36:52.360\n And we all thought like,\n\n3:36:52.360 --> 3:36:54.520\n this is the year Travis wins the Worlds.\n\n3:36:55.360 --> 3:36:57.900\n I go out there in the first round,\n\n3:36:57.900 --> 3:37:00.200\n I'm in the shoot for like 45 minutes.\n\n3:37:01.080 --> 3:37:03.080\n Like the match went into golden score,\n\n3:37:03.080 --> 3:37:05.160\n then the next match went into golden score,\n\n3:37:05.160 --> 3:37:07.440\n then the fucking next match went into golden score.\n\n3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:09.140\n Then the referee came and told me,\n\n3:37:09.140 --> 3:37:10.600\n you can't wear your gi.\n\n3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:12.800\n Then Big Jim goes, why can't he wear his gi?\n\n3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:14.380\n Any gi that has his name on it,\n\n3:37:14.380 --> 3:37:15.520\n we're not gonna let him wear.\n\n3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:17.280\n He has to wear a different gi.\n\n3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:18.800\n So then I go, fuck you, I'm leaving.\n\n3:37:18.800 --> 3:37:20.520\n And I walked out there and I fought.\n\n3:37:20.520 --> 3:37:22.480\n I lost in golden score because I did a kochi\n\n3:37:22.480 --> 3:37:23.880\n and they called it a false attack.\n\n3:37:23.880 --> 3:37:27.360\n And I went, great, I'm out of the fucking Worlds.\n\n3:37:27.360 --> 3:37:29.240\n But when I was in the shoot,\n\n3:37:29.240 --> 3:37:33.200\n I struggled because I started allowing the like\n\n3:37:33.200 --> 3:37:37.480\n Hungarian guy that I was gonna face to do things to me\n\n3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:40.280\n that I would have to play defense to and then counter.\n\n3:37:40.280 --> 3:37:44.380\n It's like, great, but now I'm doubting my own ability.\n\n3:37:44.380 --> 3:37:46.700\n So I went to a sports psychologist\n\n3:37:46.700 --> 3:37:49.920\n and the big game changer for me was,\n\n3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:54.320\n I focused more on the emotional, physical response\n\n3:37:54.320 --> 3:37:59.320\n that happens in matches rather than the actual quote unquote\n\n3:37:59.740 --> 3:38:02.920\n like Instagram picture that would have happened.\n\n3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:05.480\n So when I was getting ready for 2016,\n\n3:38:05.480 --> 3:38:08.360\n you think about like,\n\n3:38:08.360 --> 3:38:10.440\n how do you feel like standing in the shoot?\n\n3:38:10.440 --> 3:38:11.500\n Like, what does your body feel like?\n\n3:38:11.500 --> 3:38:12.560\n Is your heart racing?\n\n3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:13.420\n How's your breath?\n\n3:38:13.420 --> 3:38:15.160\n Is your mouth dry?\n\n3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:16.520\n And then you think about like, okay,\n\n3:38:16.520 --> 3:38:17.680\n the ref just started the match.\n\n3:38:17.680 --> 3:38:18.520\n What happens?\n\n3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.240\n Like, how, what's the atmosphere like?\n\n3:38:20.240 --> 3:38:23.120\n How do you emotionally respond to these things?\n\n3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:28.060\n More so than me trying to beat a specific judo player,\n\n3:38:28.060 --> 3:38:28.900\n right?\n\n3:38:28.900 --> 3:38:31.320\n Like, oh, the ref just gave you a penalty at a minute 30.\n\n3:38:31.320 --> 3:38:32.440\n Like, how do you feel?\n\n3:38:32.440 --> 3:38:35.880\n And then you start thinking about the physical responses.\n\n3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:37.760\n And when you do that really well,\n\n3:38:37.760 --> 3:38:39.600\n you can actually get the pins and needles\n\n3:38:39.600 --> 3:38:41.040\n and your body will start to sweat\n\n3:38:41.040 --> 3:38:44.760\n and your heart will start to race as if you're in it.\n\n3:38:44.760 --> 3:38:47.380\n Cause it's not about the technique.\n\n3:38:47.380 --> 3:38:49.160\n It's more about the physical.\n\n3:38:49.160 --> 3:38:51.600\n Like, what does it feel like to have your fingers ripped\n\n3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:54.240\n out of a gi in the first exchange?\n\n3:38:54.240 --> 3:38:56.280\n Now my hands can feel that.\n\n3:38:56.280 --> 3:38:57.120\n That's fascinating.\n\n3:38:57.120 --> 3:38:59.280\n And then on a cellular level,\n\n3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:02.240\n like I fought the Olympic games so many times\n\n3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:05.200\n to the point where like, it is no longer a goal.\n\n3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:06.680\n It's an anticipation.\n\n3:39:06.680 --> 3:39:07.520\n Right.\n\n3:39:07.520 --> 3:39:09.620\n So down to the experience of the grip break,\n\n3:39:09.620 --> 3:39:13.560\n that just the sweat, the, the heart beating, the, yeah.\n\n3:39:13.560 --> 3:39:15.720\n What does it feel to have your head smashed into a mat\n\n3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:17.720\n and driven across the mat with a mat burn?\n\n3:39:17.720 --> 3:39:18.540\n Yeah.\n\n3:39:18.540 --> 3:39:19.380\n And then getting back up.\n\n3:39:19.380 --> 3:39:20.220\n Yeah.\n\n3:39:20.220 --> 3:39:21.220\n And getting back up.\n\n3:39:21.220 --> 3:39:22.060\n Yeah.\n\n3:39:22.060 --> 3:39:24.000\n Like with a bit of a burn, all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:25.480\n The actual sensation on the skin.\n\n3:39:25.480 --> 3:39:28.880\n The actual sensation of what it takes to fight a judo match.\n\n3:39:28.880 --> 3:39:30.240\n It's not a strategy, like,\n\n3:39:30.240 --> 3:39:32.520\n but the actual sensations, the full experience.\n\n3:39:32.520 --> 3:39:34.320\n That's fascinating.\n\n3:39:34.320 --> 3:39:36.560\n Cause then your body's going to fight hundreds of matches\n\n3:39:36.560 --> 3:39:38.560\n without the physical damage.\n\n3:39:38.560 --> 3:39:41.220\n And you could probably get really far with that.\n\n3:39:41.220 --> 3:39:44.360\n And not also in just judo, but basically anything.\n\n3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:46.880\n You can simulate.\n\n3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:47.720\n Yeah.\n\n3:39:47.720 --> 3:39:49.400\n If you learn how to simulate well.\n\n3:39:50.720 --> 3:39:55.720\n You've lived a very, a hell of a life.\n\n3:39:55.920 --> 3:39:58.840\n Is there a device you can give to young people?\n\n3:39:58.840 --> 3:40:01.520\n Sort of a high school, college,\n\n3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:05.280\n thinking about their career, thinking about life,\n\n3:40:05.280 --> 3:40:06.960\n how to live one they're proud of?\n\n3:40:10.760 --> 3:40:15.760\n I think the number one thing I can tell people is,\n\n3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:18.560\n and how I've lived my life is,\n\n3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:20.000\n you've really got to like,\n\n3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:21.920\n forget everybody in your life right now.\n\n3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:24.040\n Your mother, your father, your grandparents,\n\n3:40:24.040 --> 3:40:26.520\n your girlfriend, your boyfriend, whoever it is,\n\n3:40:26.520 --> 3:40:30.800\n and really decide like, what is going to make you happy?\n\n3:40:32.120 --> 3:40:34.040\n At some point in my career,\n\n3:40:34.920 --> 3:40:38.280\n the act of pushing my body to the limit\n\n3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:42.180\n made me happier than winning a grand slam medal.\n\n3:40:44.420 --> 3:40:45.920\n Pushing my body to the limit\n\n3:40:45.920 --> 3:40:48.660\n didn't make me happier than winning an Olympic medal.\n\n3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:52.880\n There's a balance there.\n\n3:40:52.880 --> 3:40:56.360\n And I think a lot of people struggle with living their life\n\n3:40:56.360 --> 3:41:00.440\n where they're happy and they make other people happy\n\n3:41:00.440 --> 3:41:04.620\n or take in their feelings into the considerations\n\n3:41:04.620 --> 3:41:06.520\n of what they need to do in their life.\n\n3:41:07.440 --> 3:41:12.000\n And I think if they can cut those strings sooner,\n\n3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:13.840\n it'll allow you to get over it quicker\n\n3:41:13.840 --> 3:41:16.160\n and get to a happier place sooner.\n\n3:41:16.160 --> 3:41:17.640\n And then as long as you're focusing\n\n3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:19.120\n on what's making you happy,\n\n3:41:20.040 --> 3:41:22.120\n the things you do that make you happy\n\n3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:25.040\n will attract other people who do those things\n\n3:41:25.040 --> 3:41:29.360\n that will in turn build stronger, better relationships.\n\n3:41:29.360 --> 3:41:34.360\n And then you will also realize the best form of yourself\n\n3:41:34.560 --> 3:41:36.600\n and inspire many others.\n\n3:41:36.600 --> 3:41:41.600\n You've inspired me to, for whatever the hell I've done,\n\n3:41:42.760 --> 3:41:44.760\n at least to do a slightly better job\n\n3:41:44.760 --> 3:41:47.440\n than I otherwise would have by doing martial arts,\n\n3:41:47.440 --> 3:41:49.280\n by taking that journey,\n\n3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:51.280\n and I think becoming a better person because of it.\n\n3:41:51.280 --> 3:41:55.280\n So Travis, I have been, I continue to be\n\n3:41:55.280 --> 3:41:56.840\n one of your biggest fans.\n\n3:41:56.840 --> 3:42:01.240\n I love your whole career in the way you pursued happiness.\n\n3:42:01.240 --> 3:42:03.120\n I love what you and Jimmy have done.\n\n3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:06.240\n I love the sport of judo as represented by you.\n\n3:42:06.240 --> 3:42:08.920\n So I deeply appreciate what you've done, man.\n\n3:42:08.920 --> 3:42:11.960\n And I'm honored that you would spend your time with me today.\n\n3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:13.040\n Thanks for talking, man.\n\n3:42:13.040 --> 3:42:13.880\n Thank you.\n\n3:42:15.280 --> 3:42:16.960\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n3:42:16.960 --> 3:42:18.400\n with Travis Stevens.\n\n3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:19.720\n To support this podcast,\n\n3:42:19.720 --> 3:42:22.360\n please check

3:42:30.320\n Never interrupt your enemy when he's making a mistake.\n\n3:42:30.320 --> 3:42:49.320\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
