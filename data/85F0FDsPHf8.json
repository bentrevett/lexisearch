Caltech.\n\n00:06.760 --> 00:12.600\n Her research is on the surface environments, atmospheres, and thermochemical histories\n\n00:12.600 --> 00:16.080\n of the planets and moons in our solar system.\n\n00:16.080 --> 00:22.840\n Quick mention of our sponsors, Fundrise, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Magic Spoon.\n\n00:22.840 --> 00:25.880\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:25.880 --> 00:30.960\n As a side note, let me say that this conversation and a few others, quite big ones actually,\n\n00:30.960 --> 00:35.360\n that are coming up were filmed in a studio where I was trying to outsource some of the\n\n00:35.360 --> 00:36.360\n work.\n\n00:36.360 --> 00:38.920\n Like all experiments, it was a learning experience for me.\n\n00:38.920 --> 00:40.840\n It had some positives and negatives.\n\n00:40.840 --> 00:44.680\n Ultimately, I decided to return back to doing it the way I was doing before, but hopefully\n\n00:44.680 --> 00:49.560\n with a team who can help me out and work with me long term.\n\n00:49.560 --> 00:54.560\n The point is, I will always keep challenging myself, trying stuff out, learning, growing,\n\n00:54.560 --> 00:56.640\n and hopefully improving over time.\n\n00:56.640 --> 01:01.600\n My goal is to surround myself with people who love what they do, are amazing at it,\n\n01:01.600 --> 01:04.960\n and are obsessed with doing the best work of their lives.\n\n01:04.960 --> 01:08.080\n To me, there's nothing more energizing and fun than that.\n\n01:08.080 --> 01:12.680\n In fact, I'm currently hiring a few folks to work with me on various small projects.\n\n01:12.680 --> 01:17.560\n If this is something of interest to you, go to lexfreedman.com slash hiring.\n\n01:17.560 --> 01:21.680\n That's where I will always post opportunities for working with me.\n\n01:21.680 --> 01:28.000\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, and here is my conversation with Catherine DeClear.\n\n01:28.000 --> 01:30.120\n Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?\n\n01:30.120 --> 01:36.440\n Does this upset you or has justice finally been served?\n\n01:36.440 --> 01:38.320\n So I get asked this all the time.\n\n01:38.320 --> 01:43.440\n I think all planetary scientists get asked about Pluto, especially by kids who, we just\n\n01:43.440 --> 01:46.400\n love for Pluto to still be a planet.\n\n01:46.400 --> 01:53.640\n But the reality is, when we first discovered Pluto, it was a unique object in the outer\n\n01:53.640 --> 01:54.640\n solar system.\n\n01:54.640 --> 01:59.040\n And we thought we were adding a planet to the inventory of planets that we had.\n\n01:59.040 --> 02:04.980\n And then over time, it became clear that Pluto was not a unique, large object in the outer\n\n02:04.980 --> 02:08.960\n solar system, that there were actually many of these.\n\n02:08.960 --> 02:12.600\n And as we started discovering more and more of them, we realized that the concept of Pluto\n\n02:12.600 --> 02:18.960\n being a planet didn't make sense unless maybe we added all the rest of them as planets.\n\n02:18.960 --> 02:22.240\n So you could have imagined actually a different direction that this could have gone where\n\n02:22.240 --> 02:26.800\n all the other objects that were discovered in that belt, or at least all the ones, let's\n\n02:26.800 --> 02:33.400\n say, above a certain size, became planets instead of Pluto being declassified.\n\n02:33.400 --> 02:37.920\n But we're now aware of many objects out there in the outer solar system and what's called\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:44.640\n the Kuiper Belt that are of the same size or in some cases even larger than Pluto.\n\n02:44.640 --> 02:50.480\n So the declassification was really just a realization that it was not in the same category\n\n02:50.480 --> 02:52.640\n as the other planets in the solar system.\n\n02:52.640 --> 02:57.420\n And we basically needed to refine our definition in such a way that took into account that\n\n02:57.420 --> 03:03.120\n there's this belt of debris out there in the outer solar system of things with a range\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:05.080\n of sizes.\n\n03:05.080 --> 03:10.840\n Is there a hope for clear categorization of what is a planet and not, or is it all just\n\n03:10.840 --> 03:11.900\n gray area?\n\n03:11.900 --> 03:18.080\n When you study planets, when you study moons, satellites of those planets, is there lines\n\n03:18.080 --> 03:20.960\n that could be cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess?\n\n03:20.960 --> 03:27.120\n Is it all like a fluid, let's say not mess, but it's like fluid of what is a planet, what\n\n03:27.120 --> 03:32.600\n is a moon of a planet, what is debris, what is asteroids, all that kind of...\n\n03:32.600 --> 03:38.440\n So there are technically clear definitions that were set down by the IAU, the International\n\n03:38.440 --> 03:41.640\n Astronomy Union.\n\n03:41.640 --> 03:42.640\n Is it size related?\n\n03:42.640 --> 03:44.440\n Like what are the parameters based on?\n\n03:44.440 --> 03:49.560\n So the parameters are that it has to orbit the sun, which was essentially to rule out\n\n03:49.560 --> 03:50.560\n satellites.\n\n03:50.560 --> 03:53.880\n Of course, this was a not very forward thinking definition because it technically means that\n\n03:53.880 --> 03:58.020\n all extrasolar planets according to that definition are not planets.\n\n03:58.020 --> 04:00.340\n So it has to orbit the sun.\n\n04:00.340 --> 04:05.760\n It has to be large enough that its gravity has caused it to become spherical in shape,\n\n04:05.760 --> 04:08.280\n which also applies to satellites and also applies to Pluto.\n\n04:08.280 --> 04:11.680\n The third part of the definition is the thing that really rules out everything else, which\n\n04:11.680 --> 04:15.860\n is that it has to have cleared out its orbital path.\n\n04:15.860 --> 04:21.560\n And because Pluto orbits in a belt of material, it doesn't satisfy that stipulation.\n\n04:21.560 --> 04:22.840\n Why didn't you clear out the path?\n\n04:22.840 --> 04:26.560\n It's not big enough to knock everybody out of the way.\n\n04:26.560 --> 04:29.060\n And this actually is not the first time it has happened.\n\n04:29.060 --> 04:33.440\n So Ceres, when it was discovered, Ceres is the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt,\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:36.760\n and it was originally considered a planet when it was first discovered.\n\n04:36.760 --> 04:42.920\n And it went through exactly the same story, history, where people actually realized that\n\n04:42.920 --> 04:47.180\n it was just one of many asteroids in the asteroid belt region, and then it got declassified\n\n04:47.180 --> 04:50.160\n to an asteroid, and now it's back to a dwarf planet.\n\n04:50.160 --> 04:52.100\n So there is a lot of reclassification.\n\n04:52.100 --> 04:59.840\n So to me, as somebody who studies solar system objects, I just personally don't care.\n\n04:59.840 --> 05:04.460\n My level of interest in something has nothing to do with what it's classified as.\n\n05:04.460 --> 05:08.420\n So my favorite objects in the solar system are all moons, and frequently when I talk\n\n05:08.420 --> 05:12.400\n about them, I refer to them as planets because to me they are planets.\n\n05:12.400 --> 05:17.080\n They have volcanoes, they have geology, they have atmospheres, they're planet like worlds.\n\n05:17.080 --> 05:22.540\n And so the distinction is not super meaningful to me, but it is important just for having\n\n05:22.540 --> 05:28.260\n a general framework for understanding and talking about things to have a precise definition.\n\n05:28.260 --> 05:34.340\n So you don't have a special romantic appreciation of a moon versus a planet versus an asteroid.\n\n05:34.340 --> 05:38.260\n It's just an object that flies out there and it doesn't really matter what the categorization\n\n05:38.260 --> 05:39.260\n is.\n\n05:39.260 --> 05:45.300\n Because there's movies about asteroids and stuff, and then there's movies about the moon,\n\n05:45.300 --> 05:48.780\n whatever, it's a really good movie.\n\n05:48.780 --> 05:55.580\n There's something about moons that's almost like an outlier.\n\n05:55.580 --> 06:03.980\n You think of a moon as a thing that's the secret part, and the planet is the more vanilla\n\n06:03.980 --> 06:04.980\n regular part.\n\n06:04.980 --> 06:05.980\n None of that?\n\n06:05.980 --> 06:06.980\n You don't have any of that?\n\n06:06.980 --> 06:07.980\n No, I actually do.\n\n06:07.980 --> 06:11.220\n I really, satellites are, the moons are my favorite things in the solar system.\n\n06:11.220 --> 06:17.340\n I think part of what you're saying, I agree from maybe a slightly different perspective,\n\n06:17.340 --> 06:22.460\n which is from the perspective of exploration, we've spent a lot of time sending spacecraft\n\n06:22.460 --> 06:23.740\n missions to planets.\n\n06:23.740 --> 06:27.260\n We had a mission to Jupiter, we had a mission to Saturn, we have plenty of missions to Mars\n\n06:27.260 --> 06:28.500\n and missions to Venus.\n\n06:28.500 --> 06:33.220\n I think the exploration of the moons in the outer solar system is the next frontier of\n\n06:33.220 --> 06:35.580\n solar system exploration.\n\n06:35.580 --> 06:39.400\n The belt of debris, just real quick, that's out there.\n\n06:39.400 --> 06:42.140\n Is there something incredible to be discovered there?\n\n06:42.140 --> 06:47.500\n Again, we tend to focus on the planets and the moons, but it feels like there's probably\n\n06:47.500 --> 06:51.880\n a lot of stuff out there and it probably, what is it?\n\n06:51.880 --> 06:56.860\n It's like a garbage collector from outside of the solar system, isn't it?\n\n06:56.860 --> 07:02.060\n Like, doesn't it protect from other objects that kind of fly in and what, it just feels\n\n07:02.060 --> 07:08.500\n like it's a cool, you know when you like walk along the beach and look for stuff and like\n\n07:08.500 --> 07:13.820\n look for, it feels like that's that kind of place where you can find cool weird things.\n\n07:13.820 --> 07:20.580\n Or I guess in our conversation today, when we think about tools and what science is studying,\n\n07:20.580 --> 07:24.140\n is there something to be studied out there or we just don't have maybe the tools yet\n\n07:24.140 --> 07:26.860\n or there's nothing to be found?\n\n07:26.860 --> 07:28.340\n There's absolutely a lot to be found.\n\n07:28.340 --> 07:32.500\n So the material that's out there is remnant material from the formation of our solar system.\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:38.660\n We don't think it comes from outside the solar system, at least not most of it.\n\n07:38.660 --> 07:44.740\n But there are so many fascinating objects out there and I think what you fit on is exactly\n\n07:44.740 --> 07:48.780\n right that we just don't have the tools to study them in detail.\n\n07:48.780 --> 07:53.100\n But we can look out there and we can see there are different species of ice on their surface\n\n07:53.100 --> 07:58.100\n that tells us about, you know, the chemical composition of the disk that formed our solar\n\n07:58.100 --> 07:59.100\n system.\n\n07:59.100 --> 08:03.060\n Some of these objects are way brighter than they should be, meaning they have some kind\n\n08:03.060 --> 08:04.340\n of geological activity.\n\n08:04.340 --> 08:08.040\n People have hypothesized that some of these objects have subsurface oceans.\n\n08:08.040 --> 08:12.460\n You could even stretch your imagination and say some of those oceans could be habitable.\n\n08:12.460 --> 08:16.980\n But we can't get very detailed information about them because they're so far away.\n\n08:16.980 --> 08:21.500\n And so I think if any of those objects were in the inner solar system, it would be studied\n\n08:21.500 --> 08:24.060\n intently and would be very interesting.\n\n08:24.060 --> 08:30.100\n So would you be able to design a probe in that like very dense debris field, be able\n\n08:30.100 --> 08:32.780\n to like hop from one place to another?\n\n08:32.780 --> 08:37.980\n Is that just outside of the realm of like how would you even design devices or sensors\n\n08:37.980 --> 08:42.260\n that go out there and take pictures and land?\n\n08:42.260 --> 08:47.200\n Do you have to land to truly understand a little piece of rock or can you understand\n\n08:47.200 --> 08:52.580\n it from remotely, like fly up close and remotely observe?\n\n08:52.580 --> 08:56.780\n You can learn quite a lot from just a flyby and that's all we're currently capable of\n\n08:56.780 --> 08:58.540\n doing in the outer solar system.\n\n08:58.540 --> 09:05.300\n The New Horizons mission is a recent example which flew by Pluto and then they had searched\n\n09:05.300 --> 09:10.260\n for another object that was out there in the Kuiper Belt, any object that was basically\n\n09:10.260 --> 09:13.900\n somewhere that they could deflect their trajectory to actually fly by.\n\n09:13.900 --> 09:18.500\n And so they did fly by another object out there in the Kuiper Belt and they take pictures\n\n09:18.500 --> 09:19.860\n and they do what they can do.\n\n09:19.860 --> 09:25.220\n And if you've seen the images from that mission of Pluto, you can see just how much detail\n\n09:25.220 --> 09:29.060\n we have compared to just the sort of reddish dot that we knew of before.\n\n09:29.060 --> 09:33.980\n So you do get an amazing amount of information actually from just essentially a high speed\n\n09:33.980 --> 09:34.980\n flyby.\n\n09:34.980 --> 09:41.260\n It always makes me sad to think about flybys that we might be able to, we might fly by\n\n09:41.260 --> 09:46.020\n a piece of rock, take a picture and think, oh, that looks pretty and cool and whatever.\n\n09:46.020 --> 09:49.820\n And that you could study certain like composition of the surface and so on.\n\n09:49.820 --> 09:55.780\n But it's actually teeming with life and we won't be able to see it at first.\n\n09:55.780 --> 09:56.780\n And it's sad.\n\n09:56.780 --> 10:00.300\n Cause you know, like when you're on a deserted island and you wave your hands and the thing\n\n10:00.300 --> 10:05.460\n flies by and you're trying to get their attention and they probably do the same, well in their\n\n10:05.460 --> 10:07.820\n own way, bacteria probably, right?\n\n10:07.820 --> 10:10.100\n But and we miss it.\n\n10:10.100 --> 10:16.380\n I don't know, some reason it makes me, it's the FOMO, it's fear of missing out.\n\n10:16.380 --> 10:23.060\n It makes me sad that there might be life out there and we don't, we're not in touch with\n\n10:23.060 --> 10:24.060\n it.\n\n10:24.060 --> 10:25.060\n We're not talking.\n\n10:25.060 --> 10:26.060\n Yeah.\n\n10:26.060 --> 10:27.060\n Well, okay.\n\n10:27.060 --> 10:32.540\n A sad pause, a Russian philosophical pause.\n\n10:32.540 --> 10:33.540\n Okay.\n\n10:33.540 --> 10:36.900\n What are the tools available to us to study planets and their moons?\n\n10:36.900 --> 10:38.660\n Oh my goodness.\n\n10:38.660 --> 10:41.520\n That is such a big question.\n\n10:41.520 --> 10:47.620\n So among the field of astronomy, so planetary science broadly speaking, well, it falls kind\n\n10:47.620 --> 10:53.860\n of at the border of astronomy, geology, climate science, chemistry, and even biology.\n\n10:53.860 --> 10:57.820\n So it's kind of on the border of many things, but part of it falls under the heading of\n\n10:57.820 --> 10:58.820\n astronomy.\n\n10:58.820 --> 11:04.560\n And among the things that you can study with telescopes, like solar system moons and planets,\n\n11:04.560 --> 11:09.660\n the solar system is really unique in that we can actually send spacecraft missions to\n\n11:09.660 --> 11:11.540\n the objects and study them in detail.\n\n11:11.540 --> 11:15.580\n And so I think that's, that's the kind of type of tool that is, that people are most\n\n11:15.580 --> 11:22.420\n aware of, that's most popularized, these amazing NASA missions that either you fly by the object,\n\n11:22.420 --> 11:27.620\n you orbit the object, you land on the object, potentially you can talk about digging into\n\n11:27.620 --> 11:35.060\n it, drilling, trying to detect tectonic tremors on its surface.\n\n11:35.060 --> 11:42.140\n The types of tools that I use are primarily telescopes and so I, my background is in astrophysics\n\n11:42.140 --> 11:47.700\n and so I actually got into solar system science from astronomy, not from, you know, a childhood\n\n11:47.700 --> 11:52.300\n fascination with spacecraft missions, which is actually what a lot of planetary scientists\n\n11:52.300 --> 11:56.400\n became planetary scientists because of childhood fascination with spacecraft missions, which\n\n11:56.400 --> 12:00.500\n is kind of interesting for me to talk to people and see that trajectory.\n\n12:00.500 --> 12:03.460\n I kind of came at it from the fascination with telescopes angle.\n\n12:03.460 --> 12:08.540\n So you like telescopes, not rockets, or at least when I was a kid it was looking at the\n\n12:08.540 --> 12:14.180\n stars and playing with telescopes that really fascinated me and that's how I got into this.\n\n12:14.180 --> 12:21.260\n But telescopes, it's amazing how much detail and how much information you can get from\n\n12:21.260 --> 12:22.700\n telescopes today.\n\n12:22.700 --> 12:29.860\n You can resolve individual cloud features and watch them kind of sheer out in the atmosphere\n\n12:29.860 --> 12:30.860\n of Titan.\n\n12:30.860 --> 12:38.620\n You can literally watch volcanoes on Io change from day to day as the lava flows expand.\n\n12:38.620 --> 12:43.460\n So and then, you know, spectroscopy, you get compositional information on all these things\n\n12:43.460 --> 12:51.100\n and it's, when I started doing solar system astronomy, I was surprised by how much detail\n\n12:51.100 --> 12:55.740\n and how much information you can get even from Earth and then as well as from orbit\n\n12:55.740 --> 12:59.580\n like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb.\n\n12:59.580 --> 13:06.420\n So with the telescope, you can, I mean, how much information can you get about volcanoes,\n\n13:06.420 --> 13:13.720\n about storms, about sort of weather, just so we kind of get a sense, like what a resolution\n\n13:13.720 --> 13:15.460\n we're talking about?\n\n13:15.460 --> 13:20.020\n Well, in terms of resolution, so at a, you know, on a given night, if I go and take a\n\n13:20.020 --> 13:26.420\n picture of Io and its volcanoes, you can sometimes see at least a dozen different volcanoes.\n\n13:26.420 --> 13:30.180\n You can see the infrared emission coming off of them and resolve them, separate them from\n\n13:30.180 --> 13:36.300\n one another on the surface and actually watch how the heat coming off of them changes with\n\n13:36.300 --> 13:37.300\n time.\n\n13:37.300 --> 13:41.740\n And I think this time variability aspect is one of the big advantages we get from telescopes.\n\n13:41.740 --> 13:45.860\n So you send a spacecraft mission there and you get an incredible amount of information\n\n13:45.860 --> 13:47.580\n over a very short time period.\n\n13:47.580 --> 13:53.480\n But for some science questions, you need to observe something for 30 years, 40 years.\n\n13:53.480 --> 13:57.780\n Like let's say you want to look at the moon Titan, which has one of the most interesting\n\n13:57.780 --> 14:00.540\n atmospheres in the solar system.\n\n14:00.540 --> 14:04.620\n Its orbital period is 29, 30 years.\n\n14:04.620 --> 14:09.700\n And so if you want to look at how its atmospheric seasons work, you have to observe it over\n\n14:09.700 --> 14:11.300\n that long of a time period.\n\n14:11.300 --> 14:15.420\n And you're not going to do that with a spacecraft, but you can do it with telescopes.\n\n14:15.420 --> 14:20.100\n Can we just zoom in on certain things like, let's talk about Io, which is the moon of\n\n14:20.100 --> 14:21.100\n Jupiter.\n\n14:21.100 --> 14:22.100\n Right.\n\n14:22.100 --> 14:23.100\n Okay.\n\n14:23.100 --> 14:24.100\n It's so big.\n\n14:24.100 --> 14:27.380\n There's like volcanoes all over the place.\n\n14:27.380 --> 14:30.260\n It's from a distance.\n\n14:30.260 --> 14:31.260\n It's awesome.\n\n14:31.260 --> 14:37.700\n So can you tell me about this moon and you're sort of a scholar of many planets and moons,\n\n14:37.700 --> 14:40.140\n but that one kind of stood out to me.\n\n14:40.140 --> 14:42.340\n So why is that an interesting one?\n\n14:42.340 --> 14:47.620\n For so many reasons, but Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system.\n\n14:47.620 --> 14:50.500\n It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it.\n\n14:50.500 --> 14:56.140\n It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers up above its surface.\n\n14:56.140 --> 15:03.180\n It puts out more volume of magma per volcano than volcanoes on Earth today.\n\n15:03.180 --> 15:10.160\n But I think to me, the reason that it's most interesting is as a laboratory for understanding\n\n15:10.160 --> 15:12.780\n planetary processes.\n\n15:12.780 --> 15:18.700\n So one of the broad goals of planetary science is to put together a sort of more general\n\n15:18.700 --> 15:24.580\n and coherent framework for how planets work in general.\n\n15:24.580 --> 15:27.660\n Our current framework, you know, it started out very Earth centric.\n\n15:27.660 --> 15:30.540\n We start to understand how Earth volcanoes work.\n\n15:30.540 --> 15:35.140\n But then when you try to transport that to somewhere like Io that doesn't have an atmosphere,\n\n15:35.140 --> 15:41.540\n which has a very tenuous atmosphere, which makes a big difference for how the magma degasses,\n\n15:41.540 --> 15:44.940\n for something that's really small, for something that has a different heat source, for something\n\n15:44.940 --> 15:49.140\n that's embedded in another object's magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have from\n\n15:49.140 --> 15:50.220\n Earth doesn't apply.\n\n15:50.220 --> 15:56.540\n And so broadly, planetary science is trying to broaden that framework so that you have\n\n15:56.540 --> 16:01.260\n a kind of narrative that you can understand how each planet became different from every\n\n16:01.260 --> 16:02.700\n other planet.\n\n16:02.700 --> 16:04.060\n And I'm already making a mistake.\n\n16:04.060 --> 16:06.300\n When I say planet, I mean planets and moons.\n\n16:06.300 --> 16:08.340\n Like I said, I see the moons as planets.\n\n16:08.340 --> 16:09.340\n As planets.\n\n16:09.340 --> 16:10.340\n Yeah.\n\n16:10.340 --> 16:14.620\n I actually already noticed that you didn't introduce Io as the moon of Jupiter.\n\n16:14.620 --> 16:19.300\n You completely, you kind of ignored the fact that Jupiter exists.\n\n16:19.300 --> 16:21.900\n It's like, let's focus on this.\n\n16:21.900 --> 16:22.900\n Yeah.\n\n16:22.900 --> 16:23.900\n Okay.\n\n16:23.900 --> 16:28.780\n So, and you also didn't mention Europa, which I think is the, is that the most famous moon\n\n16:28.780 --> 16:29.780\n of Jupiter?\n\n16:29.780 --> 16:33.660\n Is that the one gets attention because it might have life?\n\n16:33.660 --> 16:34.660\n Exactly.\n\n16:34.660 --> 16:35.660\n Yeah.\n\n16:35.660 --> 16:37.980\n But to you, Io is also beautiful.\n\n16:37.980 --> 16:41.900\n What's the difference between volcanoes on Io versus Earth?\n\n16:41.900 --> 16:44.980\n You said atmosphere makes a difference.\n\n16:44.980 --> 16:48.500\n What the heat source plays a big role.\n\n16:48.500 --> 16:55.860\n So many of the moons in the outer solar system are heated from gravitationally by tidal heating.\n\n16:55.860 --> 17:00.540\n And I'm happy to describe what that is or, yeah, please, what's tidal?\n\n17:00.540 --> 17:01.540\n Yes.\n\n17:01.540 --> 17:07.740\n So tidal heating is, it's, if you want to understand and contextualize planets and moons,\n\n17:07.740 --> 17:10.660\n you have to understand their heat sources.\n\n17:10.660 --> 17:16.580\n So for Earth, we have radioactive decay in our interior as well as residual heat of formation.\n\n17:16.580 --> 17:21.300\n But for satellites, tidal heating plays a really significant role and in particular\n\n17:21.300 --> 17:27.380\n in driving geological activity on satellites and potentially making those subsurface oceans\n\n17:27.380 --> 17:31.040\n in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable.\n\n17:31.040 --> 17:37.500\n And so the way that that works is if you have multiple moons and their orbital periods are\n\n17:37.500 --> 17:42.380\n integer multiples of one another, that means that they're always encountering each other\n\n17:42.380 --> 17:46.420\n at the same point in the orbit.\n\n17:46.420 --> 17:50.220\n So if they were on just random orbits, they'd be encountering each other at random places\n\n17:50.220 --> 17:55.020\n and the gravitational effect between the two moons would be canceling out over time.\n\n17:55.020 --> 18:00.160\n But because they're always meeting each other at the same point in the orbit, those gravitational\n\n18:00.160 --> 18:02.860\n interactions add up coherently.\n\n18:02.860 --> 18:06.100\n And so that tweaks them into eccentric orbits.\n\n18:06.100 --> 18:08.020\n What's an eccentric orbit?\n\n18:08.020 --> 18:12.980\n So eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit, it just means noncircular, so a deviation from\n\n18:12.980 --> 18:13.980\n a circular orbit.\n\n18:13.980 --> 18:19.180\n And that means that for Io or Europa, at some points in their orbit, they're closer to Jupiter\n\n18:19.180 --> 18:22.340\n and at some points in their orbit, they're farther away.\n\n18:22.340 --> 18:29.580\n And so when they're closer, they're stretched out in a sense, but literally just not very\n\n18:29.580 --> 18:32.240\n stretched out, like a couple hundred meters, something like that.\n\n18:32.240 --> 18:35.220\n And then when they're farthest away, they're less stretched out.\n\n18:35.220 --> 18:40.140\n And so you actually have the shape of the object deforming over the course of the orbit.\n\n18:40.140 --> 18:42.620\n And these orbits are like just a couple of days.\n\n18:42.620 --> 18:49.300\n And so that, in the case of Io, that is literally sufficient friction in its mantle to melt\n\n18:49.300 --> 18:50.900\n the rock of its mantle.\n\n18:50.900 --> 18:52.840\n And that's what generates the magma.\n\n18:52.840 --> 18:54.660\n That's the source of the magma.\n\n18:54.660 --> 18:55.660\n Yeah.\n\n18:55.660 --> 18:56.660\n Okay.\n\n18:56.660 --> 19:03.200\n So why is, so Europa is, I thought there was like ice and oceans underneath kind of thing.\n\n19:03.200 --> 19:05.380\n So why is Europa not getting the friction?\n\n19:05.380 --> 19:07.820\n It is, it's just a little bit farther away from Jupiter.\n\n19:07.820 --> 19:10.740\n And then Ganymede is also in the orbital resonance.\n\n19:10.740 --> 19:14.900\n So it's a three object orbital resonance in the Jupiter system.\n\n19:14.900 --> 19:20.700\n But we have these sorts of orbital resonances all over the solar system and also in exoplanets.\n\n19:20.700 --> 19:25.620\n So for Europa, basically because it's farther from Jupiter, the effect is not as extreme,\n\n19:25.620 --> 19:29.500\n but you do still have heat generated in its interior in this way.\n\n19:29.500 --> 19:34.940\n And that may be driving, could be driving hydrothermal activity at the base of its ocean,\n\n19:34.940 --> 19:38.780\n which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life.\n\n19:38.780 --> 19:39.780\n Cool.\n\n19:39.780 --> 19:42.100\n So it's like heating up the ocean a little bit.\n\n19:42.100 --> 19:43.620\n Heating up the ocean a little bit.\n\n19:43.620 --> 19:48.580\n And specifically in these like hydrothermal vents where we see really interesting life\n\n19:48.580 --> 19:51.060\n evolve in the bottom of Earth's oceans.\n\n19:51.060 --> 19:52.060\n That's cool.\n\n19:52.060 --> 19:53.060\n Okay.\n\n19:53.060 --> 19:55.440\n So what's Io, what else?\n\n19:55.440 --> 19:59.740\n So we know the source is this friction, but there's no atmosphere.\n\n19:59.740 --> 20:05.740\n I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like if you and I were to visit Io, like what would\n\n20:05.740 --> 20:06.740\n that look like?\n\n20:06.740 --> 20:08.780\n What would it feel like?\n\n20:08.780 --> 20:15.560\n Is this the entire thing covered in basically volcanoes?\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:18.660\n So it's interesting because there's very little atmosphere.\n\n20:18.660 --> 20:23.300\n The surface is actually really cold, very far below freezing on the surface when you're\n\n20:23.300 --> 20:28.980\n away from a volcano, but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees or the magma when\n\n20:28.980 --> 20:30.740\n it comes out is over a thousand degrees.\n\n20:30.740 --> 20:31.740\n And so.\n\n20:31.740 --> 20:33.820\n But it does come to the surface, the magma?\n\n20:33.820 --> 20:34.820\n It does.\n\n20:34.820 --> 20:35.820\n Yeah.\n\n20:35.820 --> 20:36.820\n In particular places.\n\n20:36.820 --> 20:39.160\n Whoa, that probably looks beautiful.\n\n20:39.160 --> 20:42.540\n So like, so it's frozen, not ice.\n\n20:42.540 --> 20:46.380\n Like what is, is rock, it's really cold rock.\n\n20:46.380 --> 20:51.340\n And then you just have this like, what is, what does that look, what would that look\n\n20:51.340 --> 20:53.480\n like with no atmosphere?\n\n20:53.480 --> 20:55.700\n Would that, uh, would it be smoke?\n\n20:55.700 --> 20:58.620\n What does it look like?\n\n20:58.620 --> 21:03.420\n It's just magma, like just red, yellow, like liquidy things?\n\n21:03.420 --> 21:06.500\n It's black, it's black and red, I guess.\n\n21:06.500 --> 21:10.440\n Like think of the type of magma that you see in Hawaii.\n\n21:10.440 --> 21:13.260\n So different types of magma flow in different ways, for example.\n\n21:13.260 --> 21:19.740\n So in somewhere like Io, the magma is really hot and so it will flow out in sheets because\n\n21:19.740 --> 21:23.620\n it has really low viscosity.\n\n21:23.620 --> 21:27.580\n And I think the lava flows that we've been having in Hawaii over the past couple of years\n\n21:27.580 --> 21:35.020\n are probably a decent analogy, although Io's magma's lavas are even more fluid and faster\n\n21:35.020 --> 21:36.020\n moving.\n\n21:36.020 --> 21:37.020\n How faster?\n\n21:37.020 --> 21:41.580\n Like what, uh, how fat, like if you, uh, by the way, sorry, through the telescope, are\n\n21:41.580 --> 21:43.620\n you tracking at what timescale?\n\n21:43.620 --> 21:47.580\n Like every frame is how far apart?\n\n21:47.580 --> 21:50.820\n If you're looking through a telescope, are we talking about seconds or we're talking\n\n21:50.820 --> 21:56.500\n about days, months, when you kind of track, try to get a picture of what the surface might\n\n21:56.500 --> 21:59.660\n look like, what's the frequency?\n\n21:59.660 --> 22:03.020\n So it depends a little bit on what you want to do.\n\n22:03.020 --> 22:09.240\n I, ideally every night, um, but you could take a frame every second and see how things\n\n22:09.240 --> 22:10.240\n are changing.\n\n22:10.240 --> 22:16.300\n The, the problem with that is that for things to change on a one second timescale, you to\n\n22:16.300 --> 22:19.820\n actually see something change that fast, you have to have super high resolution.\n\n22:19.820 --> 22:22.460\n The spatial resolution we have is a couple of hundred kilometers.\n\n22:22.460 --> 22:28.260\n And so things are not changing on those scales over one second, unless you have something\n\n22:28.260 --> 22:29.900\n really crazy happening.\n\n22:29.900 --> 22:36.100\n So if you get, if you get a telescope closer to Io, if you get a, or a camera closer to\n\n22:36.100 --> 22:39.940\n Io, would you be able to understand something?\n\n22:39.940 --> 22:41.860\n Is that something of interest to you?\n\n22:41.860 --> 22:46.300\n Would you be able to understand something deeper about these volcanic eruptions and\n\n22:46.300 --> 22:52.920\n how magma flows and just the, like the rate of the magma is, or is it basically enough\n\n22:52.920 --> 22:55.100\n to have the kilometer resolution?\n\n22:55.100 --> 22:56.100\n Do you get it?\n\n22:56.100 --> 22:57.100\n No way.\n\n22:57.100 --> 22:58.100\n We want to go there.\n\n22:58.100 --> 22:59.100\n Absolutely.\n\n22:59.100 --> 23:00.100\n You want to go, you want to go to Io?\n\n23:00.100 --> 23:02.660\n I mean, I don't want to go there personally, but I want to send a spacecraft mission there.\n\n23:02.660 --> 23:03.660\n Absolutely.\n\n23:03.660 --> 23:04.660\n Why?\n\n23:04.660 --> 23:05.660\n Why are you scared?\n\n23:05.660 --> 23:06.660\n Why am I scared?\n\n23:06.660 --> 23:11.540\n Oh, you mean you don't like, I don't want to go there as a human as a human.\n\n23:11.540 --> 23:13.580\n I want to send a robot there to look at it though.\n\n23:13.580 --> 23:16.180\n This is again, everybody's discriminating against robots.\n\n23:16.180 --> 23:18.780\n This is not, but it's fine.\n\n23:18.780 --> 23:22.320\n But it's not hospitable to humans in any way, right?\n\n23:22.320 --> 23:24.780\n Just very cold and very hot.\n\n23:24.780 --> 23:27.380\n It's very cold.\n\n23:27.380 --> 23:31.680\n The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide, so you can breathe it.\n\n23:31.680 --> 23:32.680\n There's no pressure.\n\n23:32.680 --> 23:34.860\n I mean, it's kind of all the same things you talk about.\n\n23:34.860 --> 23:39.440\n One talks about, about Mars only worse, the atmosphere is still a thousand times less\n\n23:39.440 --> 23:42.820\n dense than Mars is.\n\n23:42.820 --> 23:47.060\n And the radiation environment is terrible because you're embedded deep within Jupiter's\n\n23:47.060 --> 23:53.060\n magnetic field and Jupiter's magnetic field is full of charged particles that have all\n\n23:53.060 --> 23:56.460\n come out of Io's volcanoes actually.\n\n23:56.460 --> 24:03.060\n So Jupiter's magnetic field strips all this material out of Io's atmosphere and that populates\n\n24:03.060 --> 24:07.540\n its entire magnetosphere and then that material comes back around and hits Io and spreads\n\n24:07.540 --> 24:08.900\n throughout the system actually.\n\n24:08.900 --> 24:13.580\n It's just, it's like Io is the massive polluter of the Jupiter system.\n\n24:13.580 --> 24:15.700\n Okay, cool.\n\n24:15.700 --> 24:23.260\n So what does studying Io teach you about volcanoes on earth or vice versa?\n\n24:23.260 --> 24:30.900\n Is in the difference of the two, what insights can you mine out?\n\n24:30.900 --> 24:34.900\n That might be interesting in some way.\n\n24:34.900 --> 24:35.900\n Yeah.\n\n24:35.900 --> 24:41.540\n Well, we try to port the tools that we use to study earth volcanism to Io and it works\n\n24:41.540 --> 24:49.260\n to some extent, but it is challenging because the situations are so different and the compositions\n\n24:49.260 --> 24:50.260\n are really different.\n\n24:50.260 --> 24:55.020\n When you talk about outgassing, you know, earth volcanoes outgassed primarily water\n\n24:55.020 --> 25:00.540\n and carbon dioxide, and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas.\n\n25:00.540 --> 25:07.100\n And on Io, the water and carbon dioxide are not there, either it didn't form with them\n\n25:07.100 --> 25:09.620\n or it lost them, we don't know.\n\n25:09.620 --> 25:14.220\n And so the chemistry of how the magma outgassed this is completely different.\n\n25:14.220 --> 25:24.580\n But the kind of one to me most interesting analogy to earth is that, so Io, as I've said,\n\n25:24.580 --> 25:29.580\n it has these really low viscosity magmas, the lava spreads really quickly across its\n\n25:29.580 --> 25:34.500\n surface, it can put out massive volumes of magma in relatively short periods of time.\n\n25:34.500 --> 25:39.220\n And that sort of volcanism is not happening anywhere else in the solar system today.\n\n25:39.220 --> 25:46.540\n But literally every terrestrial planet and the moon had this, what we call very effusive\n\n25:46.540 --> 25:48.580\n volcanism early in their history.\n\n25:48.580 --> 25:52.260\n Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse into the early history of earth.\n\n25:52.260 --> 25:53.260\n Yeah.\n\n25:53.260 --> 25:54.260\n Okay, cool.\n\n25:54.260 --> 26:00.220\n So what are the chances that a volcano on earth destroys all of human civilization?\n\n26:00.220 --> 26:01.780\n Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question.\n\n26:01.780 --> 26:06.020\n Yeah, a volcano on earth.\n\n26:06.020 --> 26:09.500\n Do you think about that kind of stuff when you just study volcanoes elsewhere?\n\n26:09.500 --> 26:15.380\n Because isn't it kind of humbling to see something so powerful and so hot, like so unpleasant\n\n26:15.380 --> 26:18.980\n for humans, and then you realize we're sitting on many of them here?\n\n26:18.980 --> 26:19.980\n Right.\n\n26:19.980 --> 26:22.300\n Yeah, Yellowstone is a classic example.\n\n26:22.300 --> 26:26.740\n I don't know what the chances are of that happening.\n\n26:26.740 --> 26:31.380\n My intuition would be that the chances of that are lower than the chances of us getting\n\n26:31.380 --> 26:37.580\n wiped out by some other means, that maybe it'll happen eventually, that there'll be\n\n26:37.580 --> 26:41.060\n one of these massive volcanoes on earth, but we'll probably be gone by then by some other\n\n26:41.060 --> 26:42.060\n means.\n\n26:42.060 --> 26:43.060\n Not to sound bleak.\n\n26:43.060 --> 26:44.060\n That's very comforting.\n\n26:44.060 --> 26:51.060\n Okay, so can we talk about Europa?\n\n26:51.060 --> 26:57.700\n Is there, so maybe can you talk about the intuition, the hope that people have about\n\n26:57.700 --> 27:00.140\n life being in Europa?\n\n27:00.140 --> 27:03.720\n Maybe also, what are the things we know about it?\n\n27:03.720 --> 27:08.540\n What are the things to you that are interesting about that particular moon of Jupiter?\n\n27:08.540 --> 27:09.540\n Sure.\n\n27:09.540 --> 27:15.220\n Yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives, one of the really interesting places in the solar\n\n27:15.220 --> 27:16.960\n system among the solar system moons.\n\n27:16.960 --> 27:25.220\n So there are a few, there's a lot of interest in looking for or understanding the potential\n\n27:25.220 --> 27:27.700\n for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans.\n\n27:27.700 --> 27:33.940\n I think it's fairly widely accepted that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces of\n\n27:33.940 --> 27:37.660\n really anything in the solar system is very low.\n\n27:37.660 --> 27:45.400\n The radiation environment is too harsh and there's just not liquids on the surface of\n\n27:45.400 --> 27:51.460\n most of these things and it's canonically accepted that liquids are required for life.\n\n27:51.460 --> 27:55.620\n And so the subsurface oceans, in addition to maybe Titan's atmosphere, the subsurface\n\n27:55.620 --> 28:01.260\n oceans of the icy satellites are one of the most plausible places in the solar system\n\n28:01.260 --> 28:03.740\n for life to evolve.\n\n28:03.740 --> 28:08.780\n Europa and Cellitus are interesting because for many of the big satellites, so Ganymede\n\n28:08.780 --> 28:13.780\n and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter, also are thought to have subsurface oceans.\n\n28:13.780 --> 28:19.380\n But they have these ice shells and then there's an ocean underneath the ice shell.\n\n28:19.380 --> 28:23.540\n But on those moons around Ganymede, we think that there's another ice shell underneath\n\n28:23.540 --> 28:25.580\n and then there's rock.\n\n28:25.580 --> 28:30.640\n And the reason that that is a problem for life is that your ocean is probably just pure\n\n28:30.640 --> 28:34.740\n water because it's trapped between two big shells of ice.\n\n28:34.740 --> 28:39.980\n So Europa doesn't have this ice shell at the bottom of the ocean, we think.\n\n28:39.980 --> 28:45.500\n And so the water and rock are in direct interaction and so that means that you can basically dissolve\n\n28:45.500 --> 28:47.060\n a lot of material out of the rock.\n\n28:47.060 --> 28:52.840\n You potentially have this hydrothermal activity that's injecting energy and nutrients for\n\n28:52.840 --> 28:53.840\n life to survive.\n\n28:53.840 --> 29:02.500\n And so this rock water interface is considered really important for the potential habitability.\n\n29:02.500 --> 29:08.940\n As a small aside, you kind of said that it's canonically assumed that water is required\n\n29:08.940 --> 29:09.940\n for life.\n\n29:09.940 --> 29:13.700\n Is it possible to have life like in a volcano?\n\n29:13.700 --> 29:21.660\n I remember people were like in that National Geographic program or something kind of hypothesizing\n\n29:21.660 --> 29:23.700\n that you can really have life anywhere.\n\n29:23.700 --> 29:27.860\n So as long as there's a source of heat, a source of energy, do you think it's possible\n\n29:27.860 --> 29:34.580\n to have life in a volcano, like no water?\n\n29:34.580 --> 29:37.780\n I think anything's possible.\n\n29:37.780 --> 29:39.740\n I think so.\n\n29:39.740 --> 29:42.660\n It doesn't have to be water.\n\n29:42.660 --> 29:46.100\n You can tell, as you identified, I phrased that really carefully.\n\n29:46.100 --> 29:53.380\n It's canonically accepted that because scientists recognize that we have no idea what broad\n\n29:53.380 --> 29:57.780\n range of life could be out there and all we really have is our biases of life as we know\n\n29:57.780 --> 29:58.780\n it.\n\n29:58.780 --> 30:02.820\n But for life as we know it, it's very helpful to have or even necessary to have some kind\n\n30:02.820 --> 30:09.260\n of liquid and preferably a polar solvent that can actually dissolve molecules, something\n\n30:09.260 --> 30:10.260\n like water.\n\n30:10.260 --> 30:14.100\n So the case of liquid methane on Titan is less ideal from that perspective.\n\n30:14.100 --> 30:20.460\n But liquid magma, if it stays liquid long enough for life to evolve, you have a heat\n\n30:20.460 --> 30:22.420\n source, you have a liquid, you have nutrients.\n\n30:22.420 --> 30:28.580\n In theory, that checks your three classic astrobiology boxes.\n\n30:28.580 --> 30:29.580\n That'd be fascinating.\n\n30:29.580 --> 30:32.580\n I mean, it'd be fascinating if it's possible to detect it easily.\n\n30:32.580 --> 30:38.780\n How would we detect if there is life on Europa?\n\n30:38.780 --> 30:45.620\n Is it possible to do in a noncontact way from a distance through telescopes and so on?\n\n30:45.620 --> 30:51.140\n Or do we need to send robots and do some drilling?\n\n30:51.140 --> 30:56.900\n I think realistically you need to do the drilling.\n\n30:56.900 --> 31:02.580\n So Europa also has these long tectonic features on its surface where it's thought that there's\n\n31:02.580 --> 31:08.180\n potential for water from the ocean to be somehow making its way up onto the surface.\n\n31:08.180 --> 31:12.400\n And you could imagine some out there scenario where there's bacteria in the ocean.\n\n31:12.400 --> 31:14.540\n It's somehow working its way up through the ice shell.\n\n31:14.540 --> 31:16.200\n It's spilling out on the surface.\n\n31:16.200 --> 31:18.820\n It's being killed by the radiation.\n\n31:18.820 --> 31:24.300\n But your instrument could detect some spectroscopic signature of that dead bacterium.\n\n31:24.300 --> 31:26.980\n But that's many ifs and assumptions.\n\n31:26.980 --> 31:29.780\n That's a hope because then you don't have to do that much drilling.\n\n31:29.780 --> 31:32.100\n You can collect from the surface.\n\n31:32.100 --> 31:33.100\n Skeletons of bacteria.\n\n31:33.100 --> 31:34.100\n Right.\n\n31:34.100 --> 31:35.100\n I'm thinking even remotely.\n\n31:35.100 --> 31:36.100\n Oh, remotely.\n\n31:36.100 --> 31:37.100\n Yeah.\n\n31:37.100 --> 31:45.580\n That's sad that there's a single cell civilization living underneath all that ice trying to get\n\n31:45.580 --> 31:46.580\n up.\n\n31:46.580 --> 31:47.580\n Trying to get out.\n\n31:47.580 --> 31:55.220\n Enceladus gives you a slightly better chance of that because Enceladus is a moon of Saturn\n\n31:55.220 --> 31:59.580\n and it's broadly similar to Europa in some ways.\n\n31:59.580 --> 32:00.580\n It's an icy satellite.\n\n32:00.580 --> 32:05.500\n It has a subsurface ocean that's probably in touch with the rocky interior.\n\n32:05.500 --> 32:09.820\n But it has these massive geysers at its south pole where it's spewing out material that\n\n32:09.820 --> 32:12.940\n appears to be originating all the way from the ocean.\n\n32:12.940 --> 32:20.100\n And so in that case, you could potentially fly through that plume and scoop up that material\n\n32:20.100 --> 32:22.700\n and hope that at the velocities you'd be scooping it up.\n\n32:22.700 --> 32:27.060\n You're not destroying any signature of the life you're looking for.\n\n32:27.060 --> 32:31.500\n But let's say that you have some ingenuity and can come up with a way to do that.\n\n32:31.500 --> 32:38.260\n It potentially gives you a more direct opportunity at least to try to measure those bacteria\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:39.260\n directly.\n\n32:39.260 --> 32:45.100\n Can you tell me a little more on, how do you pronounce it, Salas?\n\n32:45.100 --> 32:46.100\n Enceladus.\n\n32:46.100 --> 32:47.100\n Enceladus.\n\n32:47.100 --> 32:49.780\n Can you tell me a little bit more about Enceladus?\n\n32:49.780 --> 32:58.100\n Like we've been talking about way too much about Jupiter, Saturn doesn't get enough love.\n\n32:58.100 --> 32:59.380\n Saturn doesn't get as much love.\n\n32:59.380 --> 33:02.060\n So what's Enceladus?\n\n33:02.060 --> 33:05.300\n Is that the most exciting moon of Saturn?\n\n33:05.300 --> 33:07.760\n Depends on your perspective.\n\n33:07.760 --> 33:11.380\n It's very exciting from a astrobiology perspective.\n\n33:11.380 --> 33:16.860\n I think Enceladus and Titan are the two most unique and interesting moons of Saturn that\n\n33:16.860 --> 33:22.460\n definitely both get the most attention also from the life perspective.\n\n33:22.460 --> 33:28.500\n So what's the more likely Titan or Enceladus for life?\n\n33:28.500 --> 33:33.580\n If you were to bet all your money in terms of like investing, which to investigate, what\n\n33:33.580 --> 33:37.260\n are the differences between the two that are interesting to you?\n\n33:37.260 --> 33:38.260\n Yeah.\n\n33:38.260 --> 33:43.260\n So the potential for life in each of those two places is very different.\n\n33:43.260 --> 33:48.840\n So Titan is the one place in the solar system where you might imagine, again, all of this\n\n33:48.840 --> 33:53.380\n is so speculative, but you might imagine life evolving in the atmosphere.\n\n33:53.380 --> 33:59.900\n So from a biology perspective, Titan is interesting because it forms complex organic molecules\n\n33:59.900 --> 34:01.740\n in its atmosphere.\n\n34:01.740 --> 34:02.820\n It has a dense atmosphere.\n\n34:02.820 --> 34:04.360\n It's actually denser than Earth's.\n\n34:04.360 --> 34:09.660\n It's the only moon that has an atmosphere denser than Earth's and it's got tons of methane\n\n34:09.660 --> 34:10.660\n in it.\n\n34:10.660 --> 34:13.920\n What happens is that methane gets irradiated, it breaks up and it reforms with other things\n\n34:13.920 --> 34:15.500\n in the atmosphere.\n\n34:15.500 --> 34:21.640\n It makes these complex organic molecules and it's effectively doing prebiotic chemistry\n\n34:21.640 --> 34:23.460\n in the atmosphere.\n\n34:23.460 --> 34:25.540\n While still being freezing cold?\n\n34:25.540 --> 34:26.540\n Yes.\n\n34:26.540 --> 34:27.540\n Okay.\n\n34:27.540 --> 34:29.740\n What would that be like?\n\n34:29.740 --> 34:32.900\n Would that be pleasant for humans to hang out there?\n\n34:32.900 --> 34:34.200\n It's just really cold?\n\n34:34.200 --> 34:37.820\n There's nowhere in the solar system that would be pleasant for humans.\n\n34:37.820 --> 34:38.820\n It would be cold.\n\n34:38.820 --> 34:40.620\n You couldn't breathe the air.\n\n34:40.620 --> 34:44.900\n But colonization wise, if there's an atmosphere, isn't that a big plus?\n\n34:44.900 --> 34:47.860\n Or still a ton of radiation?\n\n34:47.860 --> 34:48.860\n Sure.\n\n34:48.860 --> 34:49.860\n Okay.\n\n34:49.860 --> 34:55.740\n So Titan, that's a really nice feature that life could be in the atmosphere because then\n\n34:55.740 --> 35:01.220\n it might be remotely observable or certainly is more accessible if you visit.\n\n35:01.220 --> 35:02.740\n Okay.\n\n35:02.740 --> 35:05.260\n So what about Enceladus?\n\n35:05.260 --> 35:07.780\n So that would be still in the ocean.\n\n35:07.780 --> 35:08.780\n Right.\n\n35:08.780 --> 35:13.300\n And Enceladus has the advantage, like I said, of spewing material out of its south pole\n\n35:13.300 --> 35:14.300\n so you could collect it.\n\n35:14.300 --> 35:21.220\n But it has the disadvantage of the fact that we don't actually really understand how its\n\n35:21.220 --> 35:28.020\n ocean could stay globally liquid over the age of the solar system.\n\n35:28.020 --> 35:34.860\n And so there are some models that say that it's going through this cyclical evolution\n\n35:34.860 --> 35:40.780\n where the ocean freezes completely and thaws completely and the orbit sort of oscillates\n\n35:40.780 --> 35:45.020\n in and out of these eccentricities.\n\n35:45.020 --> 35:49.540\n And in that case, the potential for life ever occurring there in the first place is a lot\n\n35:49.540 --> 35:55.020\n lower because if you only have an ocean for 100 million years, is that enough time?\n\n35:55.020 --> 36:00.580\n It also means there might be mass extinction events if it does occur and then it just freezes.\n\n36:00.580 --> 36:01.580\n Again, very sad, man.\n\n36:01.580 --> 36:07.620\n This is very depressing, all the slaughter of life elsewhere.\n\n36:07.620 --> 36:11.900\n How unlikely do you think life is on Earth?\n\n36:11.900 --> 36:18.780\n So when you study other planets and you study the contents of other planets, does that give\n\n36:18.780 --> 36:26.020\n you a perspective on the origin of life on Earth, which again is full of mystery in itself,\n\n36:26.020 --> 36:33.900\n not the evolution, but the origin, the first springing to life, like from nothing to life,\n\n36:33.900 --> 36:37.380\n from the basic ingredients to life?\n\n36:37.380 --> 36:40.620\n I guess another way of asking it is how unique are we?\n\n36:40.620 --> 36:46.580\n Yeah, it's a great question and it's one that just scientifically we don't have an answer\n\n36:46.580 --> 36:47.640\n to.\n\n36:47.640 --> 36:53.040\n We don't even know how many times life evolved on Earth, if it was only once or if it happened\n\n36:53.040 --> 36:56.560\n independently a thousand times in different places.\n\n36:56.560 --> 37:01.840\n We don't know whether it's happened anywhere else in the universe, although it feels absurd\n\n37:01.840 --> 37:07.540\n to believe that we are the only life that evolved in the entire universe, but it's conceivable.\n\n37:07.540 --> 37:12.060\n We just have just no real information.\n\n37:12.060 --> 37:15.740\n We don't understand really how life came about in the first place on Earth.\n\n37:15.740 --> 37:23.620\n I mean, so if you look at the Drake equation that tries to estimate how many alien civilizations\n\n37:23.620 --> 37:29.700\n are out there, planets have a big part to play in that equation.\n\n37:29.700 --> 37:36.500\n If you were to bet money in terms of the odds of origins of life on Earth, I mean, this\n\n37:36.500 --> 37:40.220\n all has to do with how special and unique is Earth.\n\n37:40.220 --> 37:45.720\n What you land in terms of the number of civilizations has to do with how unique their rare Earth\n\n37:45.720 --> 37:47.000\n hypothesis is.\n\n37:47.000 --> 37:49.640\n How rare and special is Earth?\n\n37:49.640 --> 37:52.740\n How rare and special is the solar system?\n\n37:52.740 --> 37:58.500\n Like if you had to bet all your money on a completely unscientific question, well, no,\n\n37:58.500 --> 38:03.340\n it's actually a rigorously scientific, we just don't know a lot of things in that equation.\n\n38:03.340 --> 38:08.020\n There's a lot of mysteries about that and it's slowly becoming better and better understood\n\n38:08.020 --> 38:13.500\n in terms of exoplanets, in terms of how many solar systems are out there where there's\n\n38:13.500 --> 38:16.700\n planets that are Earth like planets, it's getting better and better understood.\n\n38:16.700 --> 38:24.780\n What's your sense from that perspective, how many alien civilizations out there, zero or\n\n38:24.780 --> 38:25.780\n one plus?\n\n38:25.780 --> 38:30.420\n You're right that the equation is being better understood, but you're really only talking\n\n38:30.420 --> 38:33.500\n about the first three parameters in the equation or something.\n\n38:33.500 --> 38:38.380\n How many stars are there, how many planets per star, and then we're just barely scratching\n\n38:38.380 --> 38:41.820\n the surface of what fraction of those planets might be habitable.\n\n38:41.820 --> 38:46.460\n The rest of the terms in the equation are like how likely is life to evolve given habitable\n\n38:46.460 --> 38:51.480\n conditions, how likely is it to survive, all these things.\n\n38:51.480 --> 38:53.160\n There are all these huge unknowns.\n\n38:53.160 --> 38:58.860\n Actually I remember when I first saw that equation, I think it was my first year of\n\n38:58.860 --> 39:01.420\n college and I thought this is ridiculous.\n\n39:01.420 --> 39:08.660\n This is A, common sense that didn't need to give a name, you know, and B, just a bunch\n\n39:08.660 --> 39:12.340\n of unknowns, it's like putting our ignorance together in one equation.\n\n39:12.340 --> 39:17.860\n But now I understand this equation, you know, it's not something we'll ever necessarily\n\n39:17.860 --> 39:22.900\n have the answer to, it just gives us a framework for having the exact conversation we're having\n\n39:22.900 --> 39:23.900\n right now.\n\n39:23.900 --> 39:27.660\n And I think that's how it was intended in the first place when it was put into writing\n\n39:27.660 --> 39:33.020\n was to give people a language to communicate about the factors that go into the potential\n\n39:33.020 --> 39:38.100\n for aliens to be out there and for us to find them.\n\n39:38.100 --> 39:46.740\n I would put money on there being aliens, I would not put money on us having definitive\n\n39:46.740 --> 39:49.740\n evidence of them in my lifetime.\n\n39:49.740 --> 39:54.700\n Well, definitive is a funny, is a funny word.\n\n39:54.700 --> 40:01.500\n My sense is, this is the saddest part for me, is my sense in terms of intelligent alien\n\n40:01.500 --> 40:11.100\n civilizations, I feel like we're so, we're so self obsessed that we literally would not\n\n40:11.100 --> 40:13.340\n be able to detect them.\n\n40:13.340 --> 40:20.020\n Even when they're like in front of us, like trees could be aliens, but just their intelligence\n\n40:20.020 --> 40:28.780\n could be realized on a scale, on a time scale or physical scale that we're not appreciating.\n\n40:28.780 --> 40:31.700\n Like trees could be way more intelligent than us.\n\n40:31.700 --> 40:32.700\n I don't know.\n\n40:32.700 --> 40:33.700\n It's just a dumb example.\n\n40:33.700 --> 40:41.260\n It could be rocks or it could be things like, this, I love this, this is a Dawkins memes.\n\n40:41.260 --> 40:46.460\n It could be that ideas are the, like ideas we have, like where do ideas come from?\n\n40:46.460 --> 40:48.140\n Where do thoughts come from?\n\n40:48.140 --> 40:55.840\n Maybe thoughts are the aliens or maybe thoughts is the actual mechanisms of communication\n\n40:55.840 --> 40:57.700\n in physics, right?\n\n40:57.700 --> 41:03.060\n This is like, we think of thoughts as something that springs up from neurons firing or where\n\n41:03.060 --> 41:05.340\n the hell they come from.\n\n41:05.340 --> 41:08.160\n And now what about consciousness?\n\n41:08.160 --> 41:10.560\n Maybe consciousness is the communication.\n\n41:10.560 --> 41:18.540\n It sounds like ridiculous, but like we're so self centered on this space, time, communication\n\n41:18.540 --> 41:26.780\n and physical space using like written language, like spoken with audio on a time scale that's\n\n41:26.780 --> 41:30.960\n very specific on a physical scale, it's very specific.\n\n41:30.960 --> 41:37.620\n So I tend to think that, but bacteria will probably recognize like moving organisms will\n\n41:37.620 --> 41:42.700\n probably recognize, but when that forms itself into intelligence, most likely it'll be robots\n\n41:42.700 --> 41:45.620\n of some kind because we won't be meeting the origins.\n\n41:45.620 --> 41:49.140\n We'll be meeting the creations of those intelligences.\n\n41:49.140 --> 41:51.340\n We just would not be able to appreciate it.\n\n41:51.340 --> 42:02.820\n And that's the saddest thing to me that we, yeah, we're too dumb to see aliens.\n\n42:02.820 --> 42:07.300\n Like we're too, we kind of think like, look at the progress of science, we've accomplished\n\n42:07.300 --> 42:08.460\n so much.\n\n42:08.460 --> 42:13.640\n The sad thing it could be that we're just like in the first 0.0001% of understanding\n\n42:13.640 --> 42:15.060\n anything is humbling.\n\n42:15.060 --> 42:20.880\n I hope that's true because I feel like we're very ignorant as a species.\n\n42:20.880 --> 42:25.700\n And I hope that our current level of knowledge only represents the 0.001% of what we will\n\n42:25.700 --> 42:26.700\n someday achieve.\n\n42:26.700 --> 42:29.540\n That actually feels optimistic to me.\n\n42:29.540 --> 42:35.020\n Well, I feel like that's easier for us to comprehend in the space of biology and not\n\n42:35.020 --> 42:39.260\n as easy to comprehend in the space of physics, for example, because we have a sense that\n\n42:39.260 --> 42:45.460\n like we have it, like if you, if you talk to theoretical physicists, they have a sense\n\n42:45.460 --> 42:54.180\n that we understand the basic laws that form the nature of reality of our universe.\n\n42:54.180 --> 42:58.380\n But so there's much more, like physicists are much more confident.\n\n42:58.380 --> 43:06.640\n Biologists are like, uh, this is a squishy mess, we're doing our best, physicists, but\n\n43:06.640 --> 43:10.580\n I would be, it'd be fascinating to see if physicists themselves would also be humbled\n\n43:10.580 --> 43:15.940\n by their being like, what the hell is dark matter and dark energy?\n\n43:15.940 --> 43:21.900\n What the hell is the, not just the origin of the, not just the big bang, but everything\n\n43:21.900 --> 43:24.180\n that happened since the big bang.\n\n43:24.180 --> 43:27.320\n A lot of things that happened since the big bang, we have no ideas about except basic\n\n43:27.320 --> 43:28.320\n models of physics.\n\n43:28.320 --> 43:29.320\n Right.\n\n43:29.320 --> 43:30.320\n What happened before the big bang?\n\n43:30.320 --> 43:31.320\n Yeah.\n\n43:31.320 --> 43:32.320\n Yeah.\n\n43:32.320 --> 43:33.320\n What happened before?\n\n43:33.320 --> 43:34.320\n Or what's happening inside the black hole?\n\n43:34.320 --> 43:36.460\n Why is there a black hole at the center of our galaxy?\n\n43:36.460 --> 43:37.460\n Can somebody answer this?\n\n43:37.460 --> 43:39.660\n A supermassive black hole.\n\n43:39.660 --> 43:41.500\n Nobody knows how it started.\n\n43:41.500 --> 43:44.460\n And they seem to be like in the middle of all galaxies.\n\n43:44.460 --> 43:48.700\n Um, so that could be a portal for aliens to communicate through consciousness.\n\n43:48.700 --> 43:49.700\n Okay.\n\n43:49.700 --> 43:51.700\n Um, all right, back to planets.\n\n43:51.700 --> 43:55.300\n How, um, what's your favorite outside of earth?\n\n43:55.300 --> 43:57.740\n What's your favorite planet or moon?\n\n43:57.740 --> 44:03.500\n Maybe outside of the ones we, well, first, have we talked about it already or, and then\n\n44:03.500 --> 44:05.980\n if we did mention it, what's the one outside of that?\n\n44:05.980 --> 44:06.980\n Oh gosh.\n\n44:06.980 --> 44:08.980\n I have to come up with another favorite that's not IO.\n\n44:08.980 --> 44:09.980\n Oh, IO is the favorite.\n\n44:09.980 --> 44:10.980\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n44:10.980 --> 44:12.540\n Why is IO the favorite?\n\n44:12.540 --> 44:17.540\n I mean, basically everything I've, I've already said, it's just such a, an amazing and unique\n\n44:17.540 --> 44:18.540\n object.\n\n44:18.540 --> 44:26.700\n Um, but on, I guess a personal note, it's probably the object that made me become a\n\n44:26.700 --> 44:28.660\n planetary scientist.\n\n44:28.660 --> 44:34.260\n It's the first thing in the solar system that really deeply captured my interest.\n\n44:34.260 --> 44:42.620\n Um, and when I started my PhD, I wanted to be an astrophysicist working on things like\n\n44:42.620 --> 44:48.380\n galaxy evolution, um, and sort of slowly, I had done some projects in the solar system,\n\n44:48.380 --> 44:53.060\n but IO was the thing that like really caught me in to doing solar system science.\n\n44:53.060 --> 44:54.060\n Okay.\n\n44:54.060 --> 44:56.980\n Let's, let's leave, uh, moons aside.\n\n44:56.980 --> 44:58.920\n What's your favorite planet?\n\n44:58.920 --> 45:01.140\n It sounds like you like moons better than planets.\n\n45:01.140 --> 45:02.940\n So it's, uh, that's accurate.\n\n45:02.940 --> 45:05.700\n Um, but the planets are, are fascinating.\n\n45:05.700 --> 45:10.540\n I think, you know, I find that the planets in the solar system really fascinating.\n\n45:10.540 --> 45:17.020\n What I like about the moons is that they, there's so much less that is known.\n\n45:17.020 --> 45:21.380\n There's still a lot more discovery space and the questions that we can ask are still the,\n\n45:21.380 --> 45:22.380\n the bigger questions.\n\n45:22.380 --> 45:23.380\n Gotcha.\n\n45:23.380 --> 45:27.820\n Um, which, you know, I, and maybe I'm being unfair to the planets because we're still\n\n45:27.820 --> 45:31.580\n trying to understand things like, was there ever life on Mars?\n\n45:31.580 --> 45:37.460\n And that is a huge question and one that we've sent numerous robots to Mars to try to answer.\n\n45:37.460 --> 45:41.220\n So maybe I'm being unfair to the planets, but, but there is certainly quite a bit more\n\n45:41.220 --> 45:44.820\n information, uh, that we have about the planets than the moons.\n\n45:44.820 --> 45:48.260\n But I mean, Venus is, is a fascinating object.\n\n45:48.260 --> 45:53.340\n So I like the objects that lie at the extremes.\n\n45:53.340 --> 45:59.420\n I think that if we can make a sort of theory or, or like I've been saying, framework for\n\n45:59.420 --> 46:04.380\n understanding planets and moons that can incorporate even the most extreme ones, then, you know,\n\n46:04.380 --> 46:08.240\n those are the things that really test your theory and test your understanding.\n\n46:08.240 --> 46:10.400\n And so they've always really fascinated me.\n\n46:10.400 --> 46:15.140\n Not so much the nice habitable places like Earth, but these extreme places like Venus\n\n46:15.140 --> 46:23.620\n that have, um, sulfuric acid clouds and just incredibly hot and dense surfaces.\n\n46:23.620 --> 46:30.120\n And Venus, of course, I love volcanism for some reason, and, and Venus has, probably\n\n46:30.120 --> 46:37.020\n has volcanic activity, definitely has in their recent past, maybe has ongoing today.\n\n46:37.020 --> 46:41.940\n What do you make of the news and maybe you can update it in terms of life being discovered\n\n46:41.940 --> 46:44.180\n in the atmosphere of Venus?\n\n46:44.180 --> 46:45.180\n Is that, sorry.\n\n46:45.180 --> 46:46.180\n Okay.\n\n46:46.180 --> 46:47.180\n You have opinion.\n\n46:47.180 --> 46:49.100\n I can already tell you have opinions.\n\n46:49.100 --> 46:50.100\n Was that fake news?\n\n46:50.100 --> 46:52.740\n I got excited when I saw that.\n\n46:52.740 --> 46:56.460\n What's the, what's the final, uh, is there a life on Venus?\n\n46:56.460 --> 47:01.020\n So the detection that was reported was the detection of the molecule phosphine.\n\n47:01.020 --> 47:10.340\n Um, and they said that they tried every other mechanism they could think of to produce phosphine\n\n47:10.340 --> 47:13.680\n and they, none of, no mechanism worked.\n\n47:13.680 --> 47:16.500\n And then they said, well, we know that life produces phosphine.\n\n47:16.500 --> 47:19.540\n And so that was sort of the train of logic.\n\n47:19.540 --> 47:25.980\n And, um, I don't personally believe that phosphine was detected in the first place.\n\n47:25.980 --> 47:26.980\n Okay.\n\n47:26.980 --> 47:35.500\n So then, I mean, this is just one study, but I, as a layman, I'm skeptical a little bit\n\n47:35.500 --> 47:41.260\n about tools that sense the contents of an atmosphere, like contents of an atmosphere\n\n47:41.260 --> 47:46.740\n from remotely and making conclusive statements about life.\n\n47:46.740 --> 47:48.140\n Oh yeah.\n\n47:48.140 --> 47:53.500\n Well that connection that you just made, the contents of the atmosphere to the life is,\n\n47:53.500 --> 47:54.700\n is a tricky one.\n\n47:54.700 --> 48:00.260\n And yeah, I know that that claim received a lot of criticism for the lines of logic\n\n48:00.260 --> 48:05.060\n that went from detection to, uh, to claim of life.\n\n48:05.060 --> 48:11.760\n Even the detection itself though, did, doesn't, doesn't meet the sort of historical scientific\n\n48:11.760 --> 48:14.580\n standards of, of a detection.\n\n48:14.580 --> 48:20.820\n Um, the, it was a very tenuous detection and only one line of the species was detected.\n\n48:20.820 --> 48:26.600\n And a lot of really complicated data analysis methods had to be applied to even make that\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:27.600\n weak detection.\n\n48:27.600 --> 48:28.600\n Yeah.\n\n48:28.600 --> 48:29.600\n Um.\n\n48:29.600 --> 48:32.660\n So it could be, it could be noise, it could be polluted data, it could be all the, all\n\n48:32.660 --> 48:33.660\n those things.\n\n48:33.660 --> 48:38.100\n And so it doesn't have, it doesn't meet the, the level of rigor that you would hope.\n\n48:38.100 --> 48:44.500\n But of course, I mean, we're doing our best and it's clear that, uh, the human species\n\n48:44.500 --> 48:46.940\n are hopeful to find life.\n\n48:46.940 --> 48:47.940\n Clearly.\n\n48:47.940 --> 48:48.940\n Yes.\n\n48:48.940 --> 48:50.580\n Everyone is so excited about that possibility.\n\n48:50.580 --> 48:51.580\n All right.\n\n48:51.580 --> 48:56.420\n Let's, uh, let me ask you about Mars.\n\n48:56.420 --> 49:05.940\n So, um, there's a guy named Elon Musk and, uh, he seems to want to take something called\n\n49:05.940 --> 49:07.500\n Dogecoin there.\n\n49:07.500 --> 49:08.500\n First of the month.\n\n49:08.500 --> 49:11.340\n I'm just, I'm just kidding about the Dogecoin.\n\n49:11.340 --> 49:20.220\n I don't even know what the heck is up with that whole, um, I think, uh, I think humor\n\n49:20.220 --> 49:28.580\n has power in the 21st century in a way to spread ideas in the most positive way.\n\n49:28.580 --> 49:37.280\n So I love that kind of humor because it makes people smile, but it also kind of sneaks.\n\n49:37.280 --> 49:40.740\n It's like a Trojan horse for cool ideas.\n\n49:40.740 --> 49:45.580\n You you open with humor and you, uh, like the humor is the appetizer.\n\n49:45.580 --> 49:52.860\n And then the main meal is the science and the engineering anyway, uh, do you think it's\n\n49:52.860 --> 50:02.500\n possible to colonize Mars or other planets in the solar system, but we're especially\n\n50:02.500 --> 50:04.300\n looking to Mars.\n\n50:04.300 --> 50:09.100\n Is there something about planets that make them very harsh to humans?\n\n50:09.100 --> 50:14.020\n Is there something in particular you think about and maybe in a high like big picture\n\n50:14.020 --> 50:19.740\n perspective, do you have a hope we, we do in fact become a multi planetary species?\n\n50:19.740 --> 50:26.820\n I do think that if our species survives long enough and we don't wipe ourselves out or\n\n50:26.820 --> 50:32.940\n get wiped out by some other means that we will eventually be able to colonize other\n\n50:32.940 --> 50:33.940\n planets.\n\n50:33.940 --> 50:36.380\n I do not expect that to happen in my lifetime.\n\n50:36.380 --> 50:41.260\n I mean, tourists may go to Mars, tourists, people who commit years of their life to go\n\n50:41.260 --> 50:43.820\n into Mars as a tourist may go to Mars.\n\n50:43.820 --> 50:46.820\n Um, I don't think that we will colonize it.\n\n50:46.820 --> 50:53.540\n Um, is there a sense why it's just too harsh on the environment to, uh, to, to, like it's\n\n50:53.540 --> 51:00.260\n too costly to build something habitable there for a large population.\n\n51:00.260 --> 51:06.260\n I think that we need to do a lot of work and learning how to use the resources that are\n\n51:06.260 --> 51:09.540\n are on the planet already to do the things we need.\n\n51:09.540 --> 51:16.460\n So if you're talking about someone going there for a few months, um, so we'll back up a little\n\n51:16.460 --> 51:17.600\n bit.\n\n51:17.600 --> 51:22.820\n There are many things that make Mars not hospitable, temperature, you can't breathe the air, you\n\n51:22.820 --> 51:27.420\n need a pressure suit, even if you're on the surface, the radiation environment is, you\n\n51:27.420 --> 51:31.580\n know, even in all of those things, the radiation environment is too harsh for the human body.\n\n51:31.580 --> 51:37.940\n Um, all of those things seem like they could eventually have technological solutions.\n\n51:37.940 --> 51:46.220\n Um, the challenge, the, the real significant challenge to me seems to be the, the creation\n\n51:46.220 --> 51:49.540\n of a self sustaining civilization there.\n\n51:49.540 --> 51:53.880\n You know, you can bring pressure suits, you can bring oxygen to breathe, but those are\n\n51:53.880 --> 51:55.220\n all in limited supply.\n\n51:55.220 --> 51:59.760\n And if we're going to colonize it, we need to find ways to make use of the resources\n\n51:59.760 --> 52:05.100\n that are there to do things like produce food, produce the air, the humans need to keep breathing\n\n52:05.100 --> 52:07.140\n just in order to make it self sustaining.\n\n52:07.140 --> 52:09.620\n There's a tremendous amount of work that has to be done.\n\n52:09.620 --> 52:15.420\n And people are working on these problems, but I think that's going to be a major obstacle\n\n52:15.420 --> 52:19.780\n in going from visiting where we can bring everything we need to survive in the short\n\n52:19.780 --> 52:21.780\n term to actually colonizing.\n\n52:21.780 --> 52:22.780\n Yeah.\n\n52:22.780 --> 52:33.400\n I find that whole project of the human species quite inspiring these like huge moonshot projects.\n\n52:33.400 --> 52:38.580\n Somebody I was reading something, um, in terms of the source of food that's that may be the\n\n52:38.580 --> 52:42.860\n most effective on Mars is you could farm insects.\n\n52:42.860 --> 52:44.980\n That's the easiest thing to farm.\n\n52:44.980 --> 52:50.740\n So we'd be eating like cockroaches before living on Mars because that's the easiest\n\n52:50.740 --> 52:54.620\n thing to actually, um, as a source of protein.\n\n52:54.620 --> 52:57.860\n So growing a source of protein is the easiest thing as insects.\n\n52:57.860 --> 53:03.160\n I just imagine this giant for people who are afraid of insects.\n\n53:03.160 --> 53:07.180\n This is not a pleasant, maybe you're not supposed to even think of it that way.\n\n53:07.180 --> 53:09.780\n It'd be like a cockroach milkshake or something like that.\n\n53:09.780 --> 53:10.780\n Right.\n\n53:10.780 --> 53:15.420\n I wonder if, have people been working on the genetic engineering of, of insects to make\n\n53:15.420 --> 53:19.060\n them radiation friendly, right.\n\n53:19.060 --> 53:22.540\n Or pressure resistant or whatever.\n\n53:22.540 --> 53:29.620\n What can possibly go wrong with making radiation resistant, they're already like survived everything.\n\n53:29.620 --> 53:32.900\n Plus I, um, I took an allergy test, um, in Austin.\n\n53:32.900 --> 53:36.820\n So there's everybody's alert is like the allergy levels are super high there.\n\n53:36.820 --> 53:43.020\n Uh, and, uh, one of the things, apparently I'm not allergic to any insects except cockroaches.\n\n53:43.020 --> 53:44.380\n It's hilarious.\n\n53:44.380 --> 53:50.920\n So maybe, uh, um, well, I'm going to use that as a, you know, people use, uh, an excuse\n\n53:50.920 --> 53:52.780\n that I'm allergic to cats to not have cats.\n\n53:52.780 --> 53:56.980\n I'm going to use that as an excuse to, uh, not go to Mars as one of the first batch of\n\n53:56.980 --> 53:57.980\n people.\n\n53:57.980 --> 54:00.740\n I was going to ask if you had the opportunity, would you go?\n\n54:00.740 --> 54:03.080\n Yeah, I'm joking about the cockroach thing.\n\n54:03.080 --> 54:04.080\n I would definitely go.\n\n54:04.080 --> 54:05.220\n I love challenges.\n\n54:05.220 --> 54:08.260\n I love, I love things.\n\n54:08.260 --> 54:17.500\n I love doing things where the possibility of death is, is, uh, not insignificant because\n\n54:17.500 --> 54:22.740\n it makes me appreciate it more.\n\n54:22.740 --> 54:27.780\n Meditating on death makes me appreciate life.\n\n54:27.780 --> 54:35.660\n And uh, when the meditation on death is forced on you because of how difficult the task is,\n\n54:35.660 --> 54:37.900\n I enjoy those kinds of things.\n\n54:37.900 --> 54:44.060\n Most people don't, it seems like, but I love the idea of difficult journeys, um, for no\n\n54:44.060 --> 54:50.780\n purpose whatsoever, except exploration, going into the unknown, seeing what the limits of\n\n54:50.780 --> 54:55.460\n the human mind and the human body are is like, what the hell else is this whole journey that\n\n54:55.460 --> 54:56.460\n we're on for?\n\n54:56.460 --> 55:00.380\n I, I, uh, but it could be because I grew up in the Soviet Union.\n\n55:00.380 --> 55:07.140\n There's a kind of love for space, like the, the space race, the cold war created.\n\n55:07.140 --> 55:13.020\n I don't know if still it permeates American culture as much, but especially with the dad\n\n55:13.020 --> 55:20.460\n as a scientist, I think I've, I've loved the idea of humans striving out towards the stars\n\n55:20.460 --> 55:24.900\n always, like from the engineering perspective has been really exciting.\n\n55:24.900 --> 55:27.020\n I don't know if people love that as much in America anymore.\n\n55:27.020 --> 55:31.860\n I think, uh, Elon is bringing that back a little bit, that excitement about rockets\n\n55:31.860 --> 55:33.940\n and going out there.\n\n55:33.940 --> 55:38.180\n But, uh, so that's, that's hopeful, but for me, I always loved that idea.\n\n55:38.180 --> 55:47.140\n From a alien scientist perspective, if you were to look back on earth, is there something\n\n55:47.140 --> 55:49.180\n interesting you could say about earth?\n\n55:49.180 --> 55:51.060\n Like, how would you summarize earth?\n\n55:51.060 --> 55:57.180\n Like in a report, you know, like, uh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, like if you had to report,\n\n55:57.180 --> 56:03.580\n like write a paper on earth or like a letter, like a, like a one pager, um, summarizing\n\n56:03.580 --> 56:06.700\n the contents of the surface and the atmosphere, is there, is there something interesting?\n\n56:06.700 --> 56:11.140\n Like, do you ever take that kind of perspective on it?\n\n56:11.140 --> 56:14.860\n I know you like volcanism, so volcanoes that will probably be in the report.\n\n56:14.860 --> 56:17.020\n I was going to say that's where I was going to go first.\n\n56:17.020 --> 56:20.560\n Uh, there are a few things to say about the atmosphere, but in terms of the volcanoes,\n\n56:20.560 --> 56:28.300\n so one of the really interesting puzzles to me in planetary science is so we can, we can\n\n56:28.300 --> 56:32.580\n look out there and we've been talking about surfaces and volcanoes and atmospheres and\n\n56:32.580 --> 56:33.860\n things like that.\n\n56:33.860 --> 56:38.100\n But that is just, you know, this tiny little veneer on the outside of the planet and most\n\n56:38.100 --> 56:43.260\n of the planet is completely sort of inaccessible to telescopes or to spacecraft missions.\n\n56:43.260 --> 56:47.580\n You can drill a meter into the surface, but you know, that's still really the veneer.\n\n56:47.580 --> 56:53.500\n Um, and one of the cool puzzles is looking at what's going on on the surface and trying\n\n56:53.500 --> 56:59.400\n to figure out what's happening underneath or just any kind of indirect means that you\n\n56:59.400 --> 57:03.940\n have to study the interior because you can't dig into it directly, even on Earth.\n\n57:03.940 --> 57:06.300\n You can't dig deep into Earth.\n\n57:06.300 --> 57:13.020\n Uh, so from that perspective, looking at Earth, um, one thing that you would be able to tell\n\n57:13.020 --> 57:18.760\n from orbit, given enough time, is that Earth has tectonic plates.\n\n57:18.760 --> 57:22.940\n So you would see that volcanoes follow the edges.\n\n57:22.940 --> 57:27.040\n If you trace where all the volcanoes are on Earth, they follow these lines that trace\n\n57:27.040 --> 57:28.300\n the edges of the plates.\n\n57:28.300 --> 57:34.700\n And similarly, you would see things like the, uh, Hawaiian string of volcanoes that you\n\n57:34.700 --> 57:39.260\n could infer just like, you know, we did as people actually living on Earth, that the\n\n57:39.260 --> 57:43.260\n plates are moving over some plume that's coming up through the mantle.\n\n57:43.260 --> 57:48.180\n And so you could use that to say, if the aliens could look at where the volcanoes are, are\n\n57:48.180 --> 57:51.780\n happening on Earth and say something about the fact that Earth has plate tectonics, which\n\n57:51.780 --> 57:54.180\n makes it really unique in the solar system.\n\n57:54.180 --> 57:55.180\n Um...\n\n57:55.180 --> 57:56.180\n Oh, really?\n\n57:56.180 --> 57:57.180\n So the other planets don't have plate tectonics?\n\n57:57.180 --> 57:58.660\n It's the only one that has plate tectonics.\n\n57:58.660 --> 57:59.660\n Yeah.\n\n57:59.660 --> 58:03.740\n What about Io and the friction and all that, that's not plate tectonics?\n\n58:03.740 --> 58:04.740\n What's the difference between...\n\n58:04.740 --> 58:11.500\n Oh, it's plate tectonics, like another layer of like solid rock that moves around and there's\n\n58:11.500 --> 58:12.500\n cracks.\n\n58:12.500 --> 58:13.500\n Exactly.\n\n58:13.500 --> 58:14.500\n Yeah.\n\n58:14.500 --> 58:19.660\n So, so Earth has plates of solid rock sitting on top of a partially molten layer, and those\n\n58:19.660 --> 58:22.060\n plates are kind of shifting around.\n\n58:22.060 --> 58:26.060\n Um, on Io, it doesn't have that.\n\n58:26.060 --> 58:28.900\n And the volcanism is what we call heat pipe volcanism.\n\n58:28.900 --> 58:32.780\n It's the magma just punches a hole through the crust and comes out on the surface.\n\n58:32.780 --> 58:35.780\n I mean, that's a simplification, but that's effectively what's happening.\n\n58:35.780 --> 58:38.220\n Through the freezing cold crust?\n\n58:38.220 --> 58:39.220\n Yes.\n\n58:39.220 --> 58:41.380\n Very cold, very rigid crust.\n\n58:41.380 --> 58:42.380\n Yeah.\n\n58:42.380 --> 58:44.380\n How do you, how does that look like, by the way?\n\n58:44.380 --> 58:49.540\n I don't think we've mentioned, so the gas that's expelled, like if we were to look at\n\n58:49.540 --> 58:51.940\n it, is it beautiful or is it like boring?\n\n58:51.940 --> 58:52.940\n The gas?\n\n58:52.940 --> 58:56.740\n I mean, the whole thing, like the magma punching through, the icy...\n\n58:56.740 --> 58:57.740\n Oh my gosh.\n\n58:57.740 --> 59:00.700\n Yes, I'm sure it would be beautiful, and the pictures we've seen of it are beautiful.\n\n59:00.700 --> 59:07.620\n You have, so the magma will come out of the lava, will come out of these fissures, and\n\n59:07.620 --> 59:13.620\n you have these curtains of lava that are maybe even a kilometer high.\n\n59:13.620 --> 59:17.660\n So if you looked at videos, I don't know how many volcano videos you've looked at on Earth,\n\n59:17.660 --> 59:20.500\n but you sometimes see a tiny, tiny version of this in Iceland.\n\n59:20.500 --> 59:24.380\n You see just these sheets of magma coming out of a fissure when you have this really\n\n59:24.380 --> 59:29.900\n low viscosity magma, sort of water like, coming out of these sheets.\n\n59:29.900 --> 59:35.420\n And the plumes that come out, because there's no atmosphere, all the plume molecules are\n\n59:35.420 --> 59:42.820\n just plume particles, where they end up is just a function of the direction that they\n\n59:42.820 --> 59:47.940\n left the vent, so they're all following ballistic trajectories, and you end up with these umbrella\n\n59:47.940 --> 59:48.940\n plumes.\n\n59:48.940 --> 59:53.180\n You don't get these sort of complicated plumes that you have on Earth that are occurring\n\n59:53.180 --> 59:56.740\n because of how that material is interacting with the atmosphere that's there.\n\n59:56.740 --> 1:00:01.380\n You just have these huge umbrellas, and it's been hypothesized, actually, that the atmosphere\n\n1:00:01.380 --> 1:00:07.700\n is made of sulfur dioxide, and that you could have these kind of ash particles from the\n\n1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:13.940\n volcano and the sulfur dioxide would condense onto these particles, and you'd have sulfur\n\n1:00:13.940 --> 1:00:18.300\n dioxide snow coming out of these volcanic plumes.\n\n1:00:18.300 --> 1:00:21.380\n And there's not much light, though, right?\n\n1:00:21.380 --> 1:00:25.180\n So you wouldn't be able to, like, it would not make a good Instagram photo, because you\n\n1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:28.140\n have to, would you see the snow?\n\n1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:29.140\n Sure.\n\n1:00:29.140 --> 1:00:30.140\n There's light.\n\n1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:31.140\n It depends.\n\n1:00:31.140 --> 1:00:32.140\n Oh, okay.\n\n1:00:32.140 --> 1:00:33.140\n So you could, okay.\n\n1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:36.380\n It depends what angle you're looking at it, where the sun is, all the things like that.\n\n1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:38.580\n You know, the sunlight is much weaker, but it's still there.\n\n1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:41.180\n It's still there.\n\n1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:44.180\n And how big is Io in terms of gravity?\n\n1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:45.180\n Is it smaller?\n\n1:00:45.180 --> 1:00:47.780\n Is it a pretty small moon?\n\n1:00:47.780 --> 1:00:49.980\n It's quite a bit smaller than Earth anyway.\n\n1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:50.980\n It's smaller than Earth.\n\n1:00:50.980 --> 1:00:51.980\n Okay.\n\n1:00:51.980 --> 1:00:52.980\n Okay.\n\n1:00:52.980 --> 1:00:53.980\n Cool.\n\n1:00:53.980 --> 1:00:54.980\n So they float up for a little bit.\n\n1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:55.980\n So it floats.\n\n1:00:55.980 --> 1:00:56.980\n Wow.\n\n1:00:56.980 --> 1:00:57.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:57.980 --> 1:00:58.980\n No, you're right.\n\n1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:00.060\n That would be gorgeous.\n\n1:01:00.060 --> 1:01:03.820\n What else about Earth is interesting besides volcanoes?\n\n1:01:03.820 --> 1:01:04.820\n So plate tectonics.\n\n1:01:04.820 --> 1:01:13.540\n I didn't realize that that was a unique element of a planet in the solar system, because that,\n\n1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:17.940\n I wonder what, I mean, we experienced as human beings, it's quite painful because of earthquakes\n\n1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:22.260\n and all those kinds of things, but I wonder if there's nice features to it.\n\n1:01:22.260 --> 1:01:23.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:30.020\n So coming back to habitability again, things like tectonics and plate tectonics are thought\n\n1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:33.220\n to play an important role in the surface being habitable.\n\n1:01:33.220 --> 1:01:36.840\n And that's because you have a way of recycling materials.\n\n1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:41.940\n So if you have a stagnant surface, everything, you know, you use up all the free oxygen,\n\n1:01:41.940 --> 1:01:48.060\n everything reacts until you no longer have reactants that life can extract energy from.\n\n1:01:48.060 --> 1:01:53.880\n And so if nothing's changing on your surface, you kind of reach this stagnation point.\n\n1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:58.620\n But something like plate tectonics recycles material, you bring up new fresh material\n\n1:01:58.620 --> 1:02:04.100\n from the interior, you bring down material that's up on the surface, and that can kind\n\n1:02:04.100 --> 1:02:10.060\n of refresh your nutrient supply, in a sense, or the sort of raw materials that the surface\n\n1:02:10.060 --> 1:02:11.980\n has to work with.\n\n1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:19.580\n So from a kind of astrobiologist perspective, looking at Earth, you would see that recycling\n\n1:02:19.580 --> 1:02:24.540\n of material because the plate tectonics, you would also see how much oxygen is in Earth's\n\n1:02:24.540 --> 1:02:25.540\n atmosphere.\n\n1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:30.820\n And between those two things, you would identify Earth as a reasonable candidate for a habitable\n\n1:02:30.820 --> 1:02:35.780\n environment in addition to, of course, the, you know, pleasant temperature and liquid\n\n1:02:35.780 --> 1:02:37.260\n water.\n\n1:02:37.260 --> 1:02:41.780\n But the abundance of oxygen and the plate tectonics both play a role as well.\n\n1:02:41.780 --> 1:02:45.180\n And also see like tiny dot satellites flying around and rockets.\n\n1:02:45.180 --> 1:02:46.180\n Well, sure, yes.\n\n1:02:46.180 --> 1:02:50.300\n I wonder if they would be able to, I really think about that, like, if aliens were to\n\n1:02:50.300 --> 1:02:58.020\n visit, and would they really see humans as the thing they should be focusing on?\n\n1:02:58.020 --> 1:03:00.220\n I think it would take a while, right?\n\n1:03:00.220 --> 1:03:06.020\n Because it's so obvious that that should, because there's like so much incredible,\n\n1:03:06.020 --> 1:03:10.180\n in terms of biomass, humans are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.\n\n1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:15.060\n There's like ants, they would probably detect ants, right?\n\n1:03:15.060 --> 1:03:19.140\n Or they probably would focus on the water and the fish because there's like a lot of\n\n1:03:19.140 --> 1:03:20.140\n water.\n\n1:03:20.140 --> 1:03:25.060\n I was surprised to learn that there's more species on land than there is in the sea.\n\n1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:29.420\n Like there's 90, I think 90 to 95% of the species are on land.\n\n1:03:29.420 --> 1:03:30.420\n Or on land?\n\n1:03:30.420 --> 1:03:31.420\n On land.\n\n1:03:31.420 --> 1:03:32.420\n Not in the sea?\n\n1:03:32.420 --> 1:03:33.420\n No.\n\n1:03:33.420 --> 1:03:34.420\n Not in the sea.\n\n1:03:34.420 --> 1:03:40.220\n Not in the sea, but no, the variety that like the branches created by evolution, apparently\n\n1:03:40.220 --> 1:03:45.580\n it's probably a good answer from evolutionary biology perspective, why land created so much\n\n1:03:45.580 --> 1:03:46.980\n diversity, but it did.\n\n1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:53.660\n So like the sea, there's so much not known about the sea, about the oceans, but it's\n\n1:03:53.660 --> 1:03:57.580\n not, it's not diversity friendly.\n\n1:03:57.580 --> 1:03:58.580\n What can I say?\n\n1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:01.580\n It needs to improve its diversity.\n\n1:04:01.580 --> 1:04:04.940\n Do you think the aliens would come, I mean, the first thing they would see is I suppose\n\n1:04:04.940 --> 1:04:10.220\n our cities, assuming that they had some idea of what a natural world looked like, they\n\n1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:13.580\n would see cities and say, these don't belong.\n\n1:04:13.580 --> 1:04:15.820\n Which of these many species created these?\n\n1:04:15.820 --> 1:04:16.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:04:16.820 --> 1:04:21.620\n I mean, there's, if I were to guess, it would, it's a good question.\n\n1:04:21.620 --> 1:04:27.620\n I don't know if you do this when you look at the telescope, whether you look at geometric\n\n1:04:27.620 --> 1:04:28.620\n shapes.\n\n1:04:28.620 --> 1:04:38.180\n Like if it's, cause to me like hard corners, like what do we think is engineered?\n\n1:04:38.180 --> 1:04:42.500\n Things that are like, have kind of straight lines and corners and so on, they would probably\n\n1:04:42.500 --> 1:04:47.460\n detect those in terms of buildings would stand out to them because that's, that goes against\n\n1:04:47.460 --> 1:04:52.420\n the basic natural physics of the world.\n\n1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:58.220\n But I don't know if the electricity and lights and so on, it could be, I honestly, it could\n\n1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:01.220\n be the plate tectonics.\n\n1:05:01.220 --> 1:05:04.940\n It could be like, that they're like the volcanoes that'd be okay.\n\n1:05:04.940 --> 1:05:05.940\n That's a source of heat.\n\n1:05:05.940 --> 1:05:07.220\n And then they would focus.\n\n1:05:07.220 --> 1:05:12.180\n They might literally, I mean, depending on how alien life forms are, they might notice\n\n1:05:12.180 --> 1:05:20.260\n the microorganisms before they notice the big, like notice the ant before the elephant.\n\n1:05:20.260 --> 1:05:24.100\n Cause like there's a lot more of them depending what they're measuring.\n\n1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:29.220\n We think like size matters, but maybe with their tools of measurement, they would look\n\n1:05:29.220 --> 1:05:32.420\n for quantity versus size.\n\n1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:36.980\n Like why focus on the big thing, focus on the thing that there's a lot of.\n\n1:05:36.980 --> 1:05:40.640\n And when they see humans, depending on their measurement devices, they might see we're\n\n1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:43.760\n made up of billions of organisms.\n\n1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:46.300\n Like the fact that we have, we're very human.\n\n1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:49.940\n We think we're one organism, but that may not be the case.\n\n1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:56.420\n They might see, in fact, they may also see like a human city as one organism.\n\n1:05:56.420 --> 1:06:03.900\n Like what is this thing that like, clearly this organism gets aroused at night because\n\n1:06:03.900 --> 1:06:11.500\n the lights go on and then, and then it like, it sleeps during the day.\n\n1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:16.380\n I don't know how, like the, what perspective you take on the city.\n\n1:06:16.380 --> 1:06:20.500\n Is there something interesting about earth or other planets in terms of weather patterns?\n\n1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:26.260\n So we talked a lot about volcanic patterns.\n\n1:06:26.260 --> 1:06:32.980\n Is there something else about weather that's interesting, like storms or variations in\n\n1:06:32.980 --> 1:06:36.620\n temperature, all those kinds of things?\n\n1:06:36.620 --> 1:06:38.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:38.480 --> 1:06:45.180\n So there's sort of every planet and moon has a kind of interesting and unique weather pattern.\n\n1:06:45.180 --> 1:06:50.820\n And those weather patterns are really, we don't have a good understanding of them.\n\n1:06:50.820 --> 1:06:56.900\n We don't even have a good understanding of the global circulation patterns of many of\n\n1:06:56.900 --> 1:07:00.560\n these atmospheres, why the storm systems occur.\n\n1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:08.740\n So the composition and occurrence of storms and clouds and these objects is another one\n\n1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:13.780\n of these kind of windows into the interior that I was talking about with surfaces.\n\n1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:18.340\n One of these ways that we can get perspective and what the composition is at the interior\n\n1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:20.380\n and how the circulation is working.\n\n1:07:20.380 --> 1:07:26.660\n So circulation will bring some species up from deeper in the atmosphere of the planet\n\n1:07:26.660 --> 1:07:30.640\n to some altitude that's a little bit colder and that species will condense out and form\n\n1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.620\n a cloud at that altitude.\n\n1:07:32.620 --> 1:07:39.220\n And we can detect in some cases what those clouds are composed of.\n\n1:07:39.220 --> 1:07:46.340\n But looking at where those occur can tell you how the circulation cells are, whether\n\n1:07:46.340 --> 1:07:50.940\n the atmospheric circulation is, say, coming up at the equator and going down at the poles\n\n1:07:50.940 --> 1:07:53.620\n or whether you have multiple cells in the atmosphere.\n\n1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:57.940\n And I mean, Jupiter's atmosphere is just insane.\n\n1:07:57.940 --> 1:07:58.940\n There's so much going on.\n\n1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:02.900\n You look at these pictures and there's all these vortices and antivortices and you have\n\n1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:09.200\n these different bands that are moving in opposite directions that may be giving you information\n\n1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:20.460\n about the deep, like deep in the atmosphere, physically deep properties of Jupiter's interior\n\n1:08:20.460 --> 1:08:22.780\n and circulation.\n\n1:08:22.780 --> 1:08:24.860\n What are these vortices?\n\n1:08:24.860 --> 1:08:27.760\n What's the basic material of the storms?\n\n1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:30.100\n It's condensed molecules from the atmosphere.\n\n1:08:30.100 --> 1:08:36.100\n So ammonia ice particles in the case of Jupiter, it's methane ice in the case of let's say\n\n1:08:36.100 --> 1:08:40.940\n Uranus and Neptune and other species, you can kind of construct a chemical model for\n\n1:08:40.940 --> 1:08:42.780\n which species can condense where.\n\n1:08:42.780 --> 1:08:47.180\n And so you see a cloud at a certain altitude within the atmosphere and you can make a guess\n\n1:08:47.180 --> 1:08:51.900\n at what that cloud is made of and sometimes measure it directly and different species\n\n1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:53.900\n make different colors as well.\n\n1:08:53.900 --> 1:08:55.220\n Oh, cool.\n\n1:08:55.220 --> 1:08:56.220\n Ice storms.\n\n1:08:56.220 --> 1:08:57.220\n Okay.\n\n1:08:57.220 --> 1:09:02.260\n I mean, the climate of Uranus has always been fascinating to me because it orbits on its\n\n1:09:02.260 --> 1:09:07.420\n side and it has a 42 year orbital period.\n\n1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:11.620\n And so, you know, with Earth, our seasons are because our equator is tipped just a little\n\n1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:13.100\n bit to the plane that we orbit in.\n\n1:09:13.100 --> 1:09:16.240\n So sometimes the sunlight's a little bit above the equator and sometimes it's a little bit\n\n1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:17.240\n below the equator.\n\n1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:22.940\n But on Uranus, it's like for 10 years, the sunlight is directly on the North Pole and\n\n1:09:22.940 --> 1:09:26.900\n then it's directly on the equator and then it's directly on the South Pole.\n\n1:09:26.900 --> 1:09:33.460\n And it's actually kind of amazing that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier than it does.\n\n1:09:33.460 --> 1:09:38.500\n But understanding how, taking again, like one of these extreme examples, if we can understand\n\n1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:43.580\n why that atmosphere behaves in the way it does, it's kind of a test of our understanding\n\n1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.820\n of how atmosphere is.\n\n1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:55.540\n So like heats up one side of the planet for 10 years and then freezes it the next, like,\n\n1:09:55.540 --> 1:10:00.480\n and that you're saying should probably lead to some chaos.\n\n1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:01.480\n And it doesn't.\n\n1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:04.860\n The fact that it doesn't tells you something about the atmosphere.\n\n1:10:04.860 --> 1:10:08.440\n So atmospheres have a property that surfaces don't have, which is that they can redistribute\n\n1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:09.900\n heat a lot more effectively.\n\n1:10:09.900 --> 1:10:10.900\n Right.\n\n1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:15.780\n So they have a stabilizing, like self regulating aspect to them that they're able to deal with\n\n1:10:15.780 --> 1:10:19.700\n extreme conditions.\n\n1:10:19.700 --> 1:10:27.260\n But predicting how that complex system unrolls is very difficult, as we know, about predicting\n\n1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:28.260\n the weather on Earth even.\n\n1:10:28.260 --> 1:10:29.260\n Oh, my goodness.\n\n1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:30.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:10:30.260 --> 1:10:31.260\n Even with the little variation we have on Earth.\n\n1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:35.100\n You know, people have tried to put together global circulation models.\n\n1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.300\n You know, we've done this for Earth.\n\n1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:38.740\n People have tried to do these for other planets as well.\n\n1:10:38.740 --> 1:10:41.820\n And it is a really hard problem.\n\n1:10:41.820 --> 1:10:45.820\n So Titan, for example, like I said, it's one of the best studied atmospheres in the solar\n\n1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:50.540\n system, and people have tried to make these global circulation models and actually predict\n\n1:10:50.540 --> 1:10:55.060\n what's going to happen moving into sort of the next season of Titan.\n\n1:10:55.060 --> 1:10:57.060\n And those predictions have ended up being wrong.\n\n1:10:57.060 --> 1:11:00.780\n And so then, you know, I don't know, it's always exciting when a prediction is wrong\n\n1:11:00.780 --> 1:11:06.020\n because it means that there's something more to learn, like your theory wasn't sufficient.\n\n1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:09.620\n And then you get to go back and learn something by how you have to modify the theory to make\n\n1:11:09.620 --> 1:11:11.900\n it fit.\n\n1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:15.980\n I'm excited by the possibility of one day there will be for various moons and planets,\n\n1:11:15.980 --> 1:11:22.500\n there will be like news programs reporting the weather with the fake confidence of like\n\n1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:25.700\n as if you can predict the weather.\n\n1:11:25.700 --> 1:11:28.580\n We talked quite a bit about planets and moons.\n\n1:11:28.580 --> 1:11:31.780\n Can we talk a little bit about asteroids?\n\n1:11:31.780 --> 1:11:32.780\n For sure.\n\n1:11:32.780 --> 1:11:34.580\n What is, what's an asteroid?\n\n1:11:34.580 --> 1:11:36.940\n And what kind of asteroids are there?\n\n1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:41.860\n So the asteroids, let's talk about just the restricted to the main asteroid belt, which\n\n1:11:41.860 --> 1:11:49.580\n is the region, it's a region of debris basically between Mars and Jupiter.\n\n1:11:49.580 --> 1:11:57.620\n And the, these sort of belts of debris throughout the solar system, the outer solar system,\n\n1:11:57.620 --> 1:12:01.780\n you know, the Kuiper belt that we talked about, the asteroid belt, as well as certain other\n\n1:12:01.780 --> 1:12:08.740\n populations where they accumulate because they're gravitationally more favored, are\n\n1:12:08.740 --> 1:12:11.620\n remnant objects from the origin of the solar system.\n\n1:12:11.620 --> 1:12:17.620\n And so one of the reasons that we are so interested in them, aside from potentially the fact that\n\n1:12:17.620 --> 1:12:27.820\n they could come hit Earth, but scientifically it's, it gives us a window into understanding\n\n1:12:27.820 --> 1:12:34.620\n the composition of the material from which Earth and the other planets formed and how\n\n1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:40.000\n that material was kind of redistributed over the history of the solar system.\n\n1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:44.200\n So the asteroids, one could classify them in two different ways.\n\n1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:45.980\n Some of them are ancient objects.\n\n1:12:45.980 --> 1:12:54.540\n So they accreted out of the sort of disc of material that the whole solar system formed\n\n1:12:54.540 --> 1:13:02.500\n out of and have kind of remained ever since more or less the same.\n\n1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:06.300\n They've probably collided with each other and we see the, all these collisional fragments\n\n1:13:06.300 --> 1:13:13.120\n and you can actually look and based on their orbits say, you know, like these 50 objects\n\n1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:16.300\n originated as the same object.\n\n1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:22.620\n You can see them kind of dynamically moving apart after some big collision.\n\n1:13:22.620 --> 1:13:26.120\n And so some of them are these ancient objects maybe that have undergone collisions.\n\n1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:30.500\n And then there's this other category of object that is the one that I personally find really\n\n1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:38.560\n interesting which is remnants of objects that could have been planets.\n\n1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:45.540\n So early on a bunch of potential planets accreted that we call planetesimals and they formed\n\n1:13:45.540 --> 1:13:49.180\n and they formed with a lot of energy and they had enough time to actually differentiate.\n\n1:13:49.180 --> 1:13:53.560\n So some of these objects differentiated into cores and mantles and crests.\n\n1:13:53.560 --> 1:14:00.720\n And then they were subsequently disrupted in these massive collisions and they, now\n\n1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:05.140\n we have these fragments, we think fragments floating around the asteroid belt that are\n\n1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:08.740\n like bits of mantle, bits of core, bits of crest basically.\n\n1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:14.820\n So it's like puzzle pieces that you might be able to stitch together or I guess it's\n\n1:14:14.820 --> 1:14:22.480\n all mixed up so you can't stitch together the original planet candidates or is that\n\n1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:28.900\n possible to try to see if they kind of, I mean, there's too many objects in there to.\n\n1:14:28.900 --> 1:14:33.780\n I think that there are cases where people have kind of looked at objects and by looking\n\n1:14:33.780 --> 1:14:37.620\n at their orbits, they say these objects should have originated together, but they have very\n\n1:14:37.620 --> 1:14:39.620\n different compositions.\n\n1:14:39.620 --> 1:14:44.340\n And so then you can hypothesize maybe they were different fragments of a differentiated\n\n1:14:44.340 --> 1:14:45.340\n object.\n\n1:14:45.340 --> 1:14:49.620\n But one of the really cool things about this is, you know, we've been talking about getting\n\n1:14:49.620 --> 1:14:52.620\n clues into the interiors of planets.\n\n1:14:52.620 --> 1:14:57.580\n We've never seen a planetary core or deep mantle directly.\n\n1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:01.780\n Some mantle material comes up on our surface and then we can see it, but, you know, sort\n\n1:15:01.780 --> 1:15:03.800\n of in bulk.\n\n1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:08.220\n We haven't seen these things directly and these asteroids potentially give us a chance\n\n1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:14.060\n to like look at what our own core and mantle is like, or at least would be like if it had\n\n1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:18.980\n been also floating through space for a few billion years and getting irradiated and all\n\n1:15:18.980 --> 1:15:19.980\n that.\n\n1:15:19.980 --> 1:15:26.020\n But it's a cool potential window or like analogy into the interior of our own planet.\n\n1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:30.660\n Well, how do you begin studying some of these asteroids?\n\n1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:33.980\n What if you were to put together a study, like what are the interesting questions to\n\n1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:37.140\n ask that are a little bit more specific?\n\n1:15:37.140 --> 1:15:43.860\n Do you find a favorite asteroid that could be tracked and try to track it through telescopes?\n\n1:15:43.860 --> 1:15:51.780\n Or do you, is it has to be, do you have to land on those things to study it?\n\n1:15:51.780 --> 1:15:58.060\n So when it comes to the asteroids, there are so many of them and the big pictures or the\n\n1:15:58.060 --> 1:16:08.140\n big questions are answered, so some questions can be answered by zooming in in detail on\n\n1:16:08.140 --> 1:16:11.940\n individual object, but mostly you're trying to do a statistical study.\n\n1:16:11.940 --> 1:16:18.300\n So you want to look at thousands of objects, even hundreds of thousands of objects and\n\n1:16:18.300 --> 1:16:25.620\n figure out what their composition is and look at, you know, how many big asteroids there\n\n1:16:25.620 --> 1:16:29.380\n are of this composition versus how many small asteroids of this other composition and put\n\n1:16:29.380 --> 1:16:34.180\n together these kinds of statistical properties of the asteroid belt.\n\n1:16:34.180 --> 1:16:40.160\n And those properties can be directly compared with the results of simulations for the formation\n\n1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:42.300\n of the solar system.\n\n1:16:42.300 --> 1:16:50.620\n What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids or the contents of the insides of asteroids\n\n1:16:50.620 --> 1:16:52.960\n and what are still open questions?\n\n1:16:52.960 --> 1:17:00.340\n So I would say that we don't know a whole lot about their compositions.\n\n1:17:00.340 --> 1:17:07.220\n Most of them are small and so you can't study them in such detail with telescopes as you\n\n1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:11.780\n could, you know, a planet or moon and at the same time, because there are so many of them,\n\n1:17:11.780 --> 1:17:17.500\n you could send a spacecraft to a few, but you can't really like get a statistical survey\n\n1:17:17.500 --> 1:17:18.500\n with spacecraft.\n\n1:17:18.500 --> 1:17:24.260\n And so a lot of what we, a lot of what has been done comes down to sort of classification.\n\n1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:31.060\n You look at how bright they are, you look at whether they're red or blue, simply, you\n\n1:17:31.060 --> 1:17:35.180\n know, whether their spectrum is sloped towards long wavelengths or short wavelengths.\n\n1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:41.740\n There are certain, if you point a spectrograph at their surfaces, there are certain features\n\n1:17:41.740 --> 1:17:42.740\n you can see.\n\n1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:46.900\n So you can tell that some of them have silicates on them.\n\n1:17:46.900 --> 1:17:50.100\n But these are the sort of, they're pretty basic questions.\n\n1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:55.380\n We're still trying to classify them based on fairly basic information in kind of combination\n\n1:17:55.380 --> 1:17:59.520\n with our general understanding of the material the solar system formed from.\n\n1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:03.380\n And so you're sort of, you're coming in with prior knowledge, which is that you more or\n\n1:18:03.380 --> 1:18:06.540\n less know what the materials are the solar system formed from, and then you're trying\n\n1:18:06.540 --> 1:18:09.540\n to classify them into these categories.\n\n1:18:09.540 --> 1:18:17.140\n There's still a huge amount of room for understanding them better and for understanding how their\n\n1:18:17.140 --> 1:18:20.180\n surfaces are changing in the space environment.\n\n1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:23.100\n Is it hard to land on an asteroid?\n\n1:18:23.100 --> 1:18:26.100\n Is this a dumb question?\n\n1:18:26.100 --> 1:18:36.300\n It feels like it would be quite difficult to actually operate a spacecraft in such a\n\n1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:38.180\n dense field of debris.\n\n1:18:38.180 --> 1:18:44.100\n Oh, the asteroid belt, there's a ton of material there, but it's actually not that dense.\n\n1:18:44.100 --> 1:18:47.100\n It is mostly open space.\n\n1:18:47.100 --> 1:18:51.540\n So mentally do picture like mostly open space with some rocks.\n\n1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:54.660\n The problem is some of them are not thought to be solid.\n\n1:18:54.660 --> 1:18:58.480\n So some of these asteroids, especially these, these core mantle fragments, you can think\n\n1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:04.500\n of as sort of solid like a planet, but some of them are just kind of aggregates of material.\n\n1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:06.680\n We call them rubble piles.\n\n1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:08.660\n And so there's not necessarily.\n\n1:19:08.660 --> 1:19:15.780\n Might look like a rock, but do a lot of them have kind of clouds around them, like a dust\n\n1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:22.900\n cloud thing, or like, do you know what you're stepping on when you try to land on it?\n\n1:19:22.900 --> 1:19:26.180\n Like what are we supposed to be visualizing here?\n\n1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:29.100\n This is like very few have water, right?\n\n1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:32.700\n There's some water in the outer part of the asteroid belt, but they're not quite like\n\n1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:37.300\n comets in the sense of having clouds around them.\n\n1:19:37.300 --> 1:19:41.180\n There are some crazy asteroids that do become active like comets.\n\n1:19:41.180 --> 1:19:45.820\n That's the whole other category of thing that we don't understand.\n\n1:19:45.820 --> 1:19:50.460\n But their surfaces, I mean, we have visited some, you can find pictures that spacecraft\n\n1:19:50.460 --> 1:19:51.460\n have taken of them.\n\n1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:54.700\n We've actually scooped up material off of the surface of some of these objects.\n\n1:19:54.700 --> 1:19:58.780\n We're bringing it back to analyze it in the lab.\n\n1:19:58.780 --> 1:20:04.380\n And there's a mission that's launching next year to land on one of these supposedly core\n\n1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:09.780\n fragment objects to try to figure out what the heck it is and what's going on with it.\n\n1:20:09.780 --> 1:20:16.420\n But the surfaces, you know, they're, they're, you can picture a solid surface with some\n\n1:20:16.420 --> 1:20:23.340\n little grains of sand or pebbles on it and occasional boulders, maybe some fine dusty\n\n1:20:23.340 --> 1:20:28.020\n regions, dust kind of collecting in certain places.\n\n1:20:28.020 --> 1:20:30.580\n Is there this, do you worry about this?\n\n1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:41.320\n Is there any chance that one of these fellas destroys all of human civilization by an asteroid\n\n1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:45.780\n kind of colliding with something, changing its trajectory and then heading its way towards\n\n1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:47.460\n earth?\n\n1:20:47.460 --> 1:20:49.420\n That is definitely possible.\n\n1:20:49.420 --> 1:20:54.260\n And it doesn't even have to necessarily collide with something and change its trajectory.\n\n1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:56.020\n We're not tracking all of them.\n\n1:20:56.020 --> 1:20:57.860\n We can't track all of them yet.\n\n1:20:57.860 --> 1:21:01.820\n You know, there's still a lot of them.\n\n1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:05.300\n People are, people are tracking a lot of them and we are doing our best to track more of\n\n1:21:05.300 --> 1:21:06.300\n them.\n\n1:21:06.300 --> 1:21:09.540\n But there are a lot of them out there and it would be potentially catastrophic if one\n\n1:21:09.540 --> 1:21:11.260\n of them impacted earth.\n\n1:21:11.260 --> 1:21:16.980\n Have you, are you aware of this Apophis object?\n\n1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:23.140\n So there's an asteroid, a near earth object called Apophis that people thought had a decent\n\n1:21:23.140 --> 1:21:28.840\n probability of hitting earth in 2029 and then potentially again in 2036.\n\n1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:29.940\n So they did a lot of studies.\n\n1:21:29.940 --> 1:21:35.060\n It's not actually going to hit earth, but it is going to come very close.\n\n1:21:35.060 --> 1:21:40.780\n It's going to be visible in the sky in a relatively dark, I mean, not even that dark, probably\n\n1:21:40.780 --> 1:21:50.580\n not visible from Los Angeles, but, and it's going to come a 10th of the way between the\n\n1:21:50.580 --> 1:21:51.740\n earth and the moon.\n\n1:21:51.740 --> 1:21:55.940\n It's going to come closer apparently than some geosynchronous communication satellites.\n\n1:21:55.940 --> 1:21:56.940\n Oh wow.\n\n1:21:56.940 --> 1:22:02.660\n So that is a close call, but people have studied it and apparently are very confident it's\n\n1:22:02.660 --> 1:22:04.300\n not actually going to hit us, but it was.\n\n1:22:04.300 --> 1:22:08.540\n I'm going to have to look into this because I'm very sure, I'm very sure what's going\n\n1:22:08.540 --> 1:22:13.100\n to happen if an asteroid actually hits earth.\n\n1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:23.300\n That the scientific community and government will confidently say that, uh, we have nothing\n\n1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:24.300\n to worry about.\n\n1:22:24.300 --> 1:22:26.340\n It's going to be a close call.\n\n1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:30.420\n And then last minute they'll be like, there was a miscalculation.\n\n1:22:30.420 --> 1:22:31.420\n They're not lying.\n\n1:22:31.420 --> 1:22:35.300\n It's just like the space of possibilities, because it's very difficult to track these\n\n1:22:35.300 --> 1:22:40.500\n kinds of things and there's a lot of kind of, um, there's complexities involved in this.\n\n1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:46.340\n There's a lot of uncertainties that I just, something tells me that human civilization\n\n1:22:46.340 --> 1:22:49.540\n will end with, we'll see it coming.\n\n1:22:49.540 --> 1:22:54.020\n And then last minute there'll be a, oops, we'll like, we'll see it coming and we'll,\n\n1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:57.740\n it'll be like, no, it's just, it's just threatening, but no problem.\n\n1:22:57.740 --> 1:22:58.740\n No problem.\n\n1:22:58.740 --> 1:23:01.140\n And last minute it'll be like, oops, that was a miscalculation.\n\n1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:10.380\n And it's all over in a matter of like a week, or just very positive and optimistic today.\n\n1:23:10.380 --> 1:23:16.380\n Is there any chance that Bruce Willis can save us in the sense that from what you know\n\n1:23:16.380 --> 1:23:24.460\n about asteroids, is there something that, um, you can catch them early enough to, uh,\n\n1:23:24.460 --> 1:23:31.660\n change volcanic, uh, eruptions, right, um, sort of drill, put a nuclear weapon inside\n\n1:23:31.660 --> 1:23:37.180\n and break up the asteroid or change its trajectory?\n\n1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:38.980\n There is potential for that.\n\n1:23:38.980 --> 1:23:48.180\n If you catch it early enough in advance, um, I think in theory, if you knew five years\n\n1:23:48.180 --> 1:23:56.380\n in advance, um, depending on the objects and how close, how much you would need to deflect\n\n1:23:56.380 --> 1:24:00.620\n it, um, you could deflect it a little bit.\n\n1:24:00.620 --> 1:24:04.100\n I don't know that it would be sufficient in all cases.\n\n1:24:04.100 --> 1:24:09.500\n Um, and this is definitely not my specific area of expertise, but my understanding is\n\n1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:11.980\n that there is something you could do.\n\n1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:17.460\n Um, but it also, how you would carry that out depends a lot on the properties of the\n\n1:24:17.460 --> 1:24:18.460\n asteroid.\n\n1:24:18.460 --> 1:24:20.220\n If it's a solid object versus a rubble pile.\n\n1:24:20.220 --> 1:24:26.980\n So let's say you planted some bomb in the middle of it and it blew up, but it was just\n\n1:24:26.980 --> 1:24:28.940\n kind of a pile of material anyway.\n\n1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:33.420\n And then that material comes back together and then you kind of just have the same thing.\n\n1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:38.620\n Presumably its trajectory would be altered, but it's, it's like a terminator too.\n\n1:24:38.620 --> 1:24:43.120\n When it's like the thing that just like you shoot it in splashes and then comes back together\n\n1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.940\n will be very useless.\n\n1:24:44.940 --> 1:24:45.940\n That's fascinating.\n\n1:24:45.940 --> 1:24:48.580\n It was fascinating.\n\n1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:56.860\n I've gotten a lot of hope from watching, uh, uh, SpaceX rockets that land.\n\n1:24:56.860 --> 1:24:57.940\n There's so much.\n\n1:24:57.940 --> 1:24:58.940\n It's like, Oh wow.\n\n1:24:58.940 --> 1:25:06.140\n From an AI perspective, from a robotics perspective, wow, we can do a hell of an amazing job with\n\n1:25:06.140 --> 1:25:09.380\n control.\n\n1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:15.140\n And but then we have an understanding about surfaces here on earth, we can map up a lot\n\n1:25:15.140 --> 1:25:16.140\n of things.\n\n1:25:16.140 --> 1:25:17.140\n I wonder if we can do that.\n\n1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:23.740\n Some kind of detail of being able to have that same level of precision in landing on\n\n1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:31.940\n surfaces with as wide of a variety as asteroids have to be able to understand the exact properties\n\n1:25:31.940 --> 1:25:37.620\n of the surface and be able to encode that into whatever rocket that lands sufficiently\n\n1:25:37.620 --> 1:25:44.580\n to, I presume humans, unlike the, unlike the movies, humans would likely get in the way.\n\n1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:52.900\n Like it should all be done by robots and like land drill, place the, the explosive that\n\n1:25:52.900 --> 1:25:56.580\n should all be done through control, the robots.\n\n1:25:56.580 --> 1:26:01.080\n And then you should be able to dynamically adjust to, um, to the surface.\n\n1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:05.620\n The flip side of that for a robotics person, I don't know if you've seen these, it's been\n\n1:26:05.620 --> 1:26:07.100\n very heartbreaking.\n\n1:26:07.100 --> 1:26:14.060\n Uh, somebody I know well, Russ Tedrick at MIT led the DARPA robotics challenge team for\n\n1:26:14.060 --> 1:26:15.980\n the humanoid robot challenge for DARPA.\n\n1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:20.460\n I don't know if you've seen videos of robots on two feet falling, but you're talking about\n\n1:26:20.460 --> 1:26:24.740\n millions, you know, several years of work from with some of the most brilliant roboticists\n\n1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:27.060\n in the world, millions of dollars.\n\n1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:31.140\n And the final thing is a highlight video on YouTube of robots falling, but they had a\n\n1:26:31.140 --> 1:26:33.800\n lot of trouble with uneven surfaces.\n\n1:26:33.800 --> 1:26:38.420\n That's basically what you have to do with, uh, the challenge involves you're mostly autonomous\n\n1:26:38.420 --> 1:26:43.300\n with some partial human communication, but that human communication is broken up.\n\n1:26:43.300 --> 1:26:48.700\n Like you don't get a, you get a noisy channel, so you can, humans can, which is very similar\n\n1:26:48.700 --> 1:26:54.860\n to what it would be like in humans remotely operating a thing on an asteroid.\n\n1:26:54.860 --> 1:26:57.420\n And so with that, robots really struggled.\n\n1:26:57.420 --> 1:27:03.300\n There's some hilarious painful videos of like a robot, not able to like open the door.\n\n1:27:03.300 --> 1:27:07.640\n And then it tries to open the door without like, it misses the handle and in doing so\n\n1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:12.020\n like falls, I mean, it's, um, it's painful to watch.\n\n1:27:12.020 --> 1:27:15.740\n So like that, there's that, and then there's SpaceX.\n\n1:27:15.740 --> 1:27:21.780\n So I have hope from SpaceX and then I have less hope from bipedal robotics, um, but it's\n\n1:27:21.780 --> 1:27:22.780\n fun.\n\n1:27:22.780 --> 1:27:23.900\n It's fun to kind of imagine.\n\n1:27:23.900 --> 1:27:28.420\n And I think the planetary side of it comes into play in understanding the surfaces of\n\n1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:34.540\n these asteroids more and more that, you know, forget sort of destruction of human civilization.\n\n1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:39.100\n It'd be cool to have like spacecraft just landing on all these asteroids to study them\n\n1:27:39.100 --> 1:27:44.940\n at scale and being able to figure out dynamically what, you know, whether it's a rubble pile\n\n1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:51.660\n or whether it's, um, a solid objects, like, do you see that kind of future of science?\n\n1:27:51.660 --> 1:27:57.860\n Maybe a hundred, 200, 300 years from now, where there's just robots expanding out through\n\n1:27:57.860 --> 1:28:00.800\n the solar system, like sensors, essentially.\n\n1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:04.260\n Some of it taking pictures from a distance, some of them landing, just exploring and giving\n\n1:28:04.260 --> 1:28:05.260\n us data.\n\n1:28:05.260 --> 1:28:10.580\n Cause it feels like we're working with very little data right now.\n\n1:28:10.580 --> 1:28:14.420\n Sure I, I do see exploration going that way.\n\n1:28:14.420 --> 1:28:23.340\n I think, um, the way that NASA is currently or historically has been doing missions is\n\n1:28:23.340 --> 1:28:28.140\n putting together these, these really large missions that do a lot of things and are extremely\n\n1:28:28.140 --> 1:28:30.500\n well tested and have a very low rate of failure.\n\n1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:38.840\n But now that, um, these sort of CubeSat technologies are, are becoming easier to build, easier\n\n1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:41.700\n to launch, they're, they're very cheap.\n\n1:28:41.700 --> 1:28:43.980\n And you know, NASA is getting involved in this as well.\n\n1:28:43.980 --> 1:28:48.960\n There's, there's a lot of interest in these missions that are relatively small, relatively\n\n1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:50.580\n cheap and just do one thing.\n\n1:28:50.580 --> 1:28:54.160\n So you can really optimize it to just do this one thing.\n\n1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:57.140\n And maybe you could build a hundred of them and send them to different asteroids.\n\n1:28:57.140 --> 1:29:01.100\n And they would just collect this one piece of information from each asteroid.\n\n1:29:01.100 --> 1:29:06.700\n It's a kind of different, more distributed way of doing science, I guess.\n\n1:29:06.700 --> 1:29:11.160\n And there's a ton of potential there, I agree.\n\n1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:17.220\n Let me ask you about objects or one particular object from outside our solar system.\n\n1:29:17.220 --> 1:29:19.660\n We don't get to study many of these, right?\n\n1:29:19.660 --> 1:29:24.580\n They don't, we don't get stuff that just flies in out of nowhere from outside the solar system\n\n1:29:24.580 --> 1:29:25.580\n and flies through.\n\n1:29:25.580 --> 1:29:30.460\n Apparently there's been two recently in the past few years.\n\n1:29:30.460 --> 1:29:34.540\n One of them is Amuamua.\n\n1:29:34.540 --> 1:29:37.340\n What are your thoughts about Amuamua?\n\n1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:38.340\n So fun to say.\n\n1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:44.260\n Could it, could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization or is it just a weird shaped\n\n1:29:44.260 --> 1:29:45.260\n comet?\n\n1:29:45.260 --> 1:29:49.540\n I like the way that's phrased.\n\n1:29:49.540 --> 1:29:53.540\n Um, so Amuamua is, is a fascinating object.\n\n1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:57.380\n Just the fact that we have started discovering things that are coming in from outside our\n\n1:29:57.380 --> 1:30:01.980\n solar system is amazing and can, can start to study them.\n\n1:30:01.980 --> 1:30:09.340\n And now that we have seen some, we can design now kind of thinking in advance.\n\n1:30:09.340 --> 1:30:11.980\n The next time we see one, we will be much more ready for it.\n\n1:30:11.980 --> 1:30:14.140\n We will know which telescopes we want to point at it.\n\n1:30:14.140 --> 1:30:18.660\n We will have explored whether we could even launch a fast turnaround mission to actually\n\n1:30:18.660 --> 1:30:23.540\n like get to it before it leaves the solar system.\n\n1:30:23.540 --> 1:30:30.460\n In terms of Amuamua, yeah, it's, for an object in our solar system, it's really unusual in\n\n1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:33.820\n two particular ways.\n\n1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:38.860\n One is the dimensions that we don't see natural things in our solar system that are kind of\n\n1:30:38.860 --> 1:30:39.980\n long and skinny.\n\n1:30:39.980 --> 1:30:45.820\n We see, the things we see in our solar system don't deviate from spherical by that much.\n\n1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:50.540\n And then that it showed these strange properties of accelerating as it was leaving the solar\n\n1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:53.380\n system, which was not understood at first.\n\n1:30:53.380 --> 1:31:03.180\n So in terms of the alien space junk, you know, as a scientist, I cannot rule out that possibility.\n\n1:31:03.180 --> 1:31:05.540\n I have no evidence to the contrary.\n\n1:31:05.540 --> 1:31:06.540\n Um, however,\n\n1:31:06.540 --> 1:31:10.460\n See, you're saying there's a chance.\n\n1:31:10.460 --> 1:31:16.580\n I cannot, I cannot, as a scientist, honestly say that I can rule out that it's alien space\n\n1:31:16.580 --> 1:31:17.580\n junk.\n\n1:31:17.580 --> 1:31:26.640\n However, I see the kind of alien explanation as following this, the Sagan's extraordinary\n\n1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:29.200\n claims require extraordinary evidence.\n\n1:31:29.200 --> 1:31:37.580\n If you are going to actually claim that something is aliens, you need to carefully evaluate,\n\n1:31:37.580 --> 1:31:43.260\n everyone needs to carefully evaluate the other options and see whether it could just be something\n\n1:31:43.260 --> 1:31:45.260\n that we know exists that makes sense.\n\n1:31:45.260 --> 1:31:53.660\n In the case of Oumuamua, there are explanations that fit well within our understanding of\n\n1:31:53.660 --> 1:31:54.660\n how things work.\n\n1:31:54.660 --> 1:31:59.340\n So there are a couple, there are two hypotheses for what it could be made of.\n\n1:31:59.340 --> 1:32:02.140\n They're both basically just ice shards.\n\n1:32:02.140 --> 1:32:05.940\n In one case, it's a nitrogen ice shard that came off of something like Pluto in another\n\n1:32:05.940 --> 1:32:10.980\n solar system, that Pluto got hit with something and broke up into pieces, and one of those\n\n1:32:10.980 --> 1:32:13.320\n pieces came through our solar system.\n\n1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:19.540\n In the other scenario, it's a bit of a failed solar system.\n\n1:32:19.540 --> 1:32:24.820\n So our solar system formed out of a collapsing molecular cloud.\n\n1:32:24.820 --> 1:32:29.660\n Sometimes those molecular clouds are not massive enough, and they sort of collapse into bits,\n\n1:32:29.660 --> 1:32:33.180\n but they don't actually form a solar system, but you end up with these kind of chunks of\n\n1:32:33.180 --> 1:32:35.100\n hydrogen ice, apparently.\n\n1:32:35.100 --> 1:32:38.860\n And so one of those chunks of hydrogen ice could have got ejected and passed through\n\n1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:39.860\n our solar system.\n\n1:32:39.860 --> 1:32:45.780\n So both cases explain these properties in about the same way.\n\n1:32:45.780 --> 1:32:50.720\n So those ices will sublimate once they've passed the sun, and so as they're moving away\n\n1:32:50.720 --> 1:32:55.860\n from the sun, you have the hydrogen or nitrogen ice sublimating off the sunward part of it,\n\n1:32:55.860 --> 1:32:58.940\n and so that is responsible for the acceleration.\n\n1:32:58.940 --> 1:33:04.760\n The shape also, because you have all this ice sublimating off the surface, if you take\n\n1:33:04.760 --> 1:33:11.220\n something, the analogy that works pretty well here is for a bar of soap.\n\n1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:17.140\n Your bar of soap starts out sort of close to spherical, at least from a physicist perspective,\n\n1:33:17.140 --> 1:33:21.380\n and as you use it over time, you eventually end up with this long, thin shard because\n\n1:33:21.380 --> 1:33:28.100\n it's been just by sort of weathering, as we would call it.\n\n1:33:28.100 --> 1:33:32.320\n And so in the same way, if you just sublimate material off of one of these ice shards, it\n\n1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:37.020\n ends up long and thin, and it ends up accelerating out of the solar system.\n\n1:33:37.020 --> 1:33:43.380\n And so given that these properties can be reasonably well explained that way, we should\n\n1:33:43.380 --> 1:33:47.380\n be extremely skeptical about attributing things to aliens.\n\n1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:54.060\n See, the reason I like to think that it's aliens is because it puts a lot of priority\n\n1:33:54.060 --> 1:34:00.020\n on us not being lazy and we need to catch this thing next time it comes around.\n\n1:34:00.020 --> 1:34:06.420\n I like the idea that there's objects, it almost saddens me, they come out of the darkness\n\n1:34:06.420 --> 1:34:10.620\n really fast and just fly by and go and leave.\n\n1:34:10.620 --> 1:34:16.260\n It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to study them.\n\n1:34:16.260 --> 1:34:22.540\n It's the easiest way to do space travel outside of the solar system is having the things come\n\n1:34:22.540 --> 1:34:23.540\n to us.\n\n1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:24.540\n Right?\n\n1:34:24.540 --> 1:34:25.540\n I like that way of putting it.\n\n1:34:25.540 --> 1:34:28.880\n And it would be nice to just land on it.\n\n1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:36.620\n And first of all, really importantly, detect it early and then land on it with a really\n\n1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:47.500\n nice spacecraft and study the hell out of it.\n\n1:34:47.500 --> 1:34:56.740\n If there's a chance it's aliens, alien life, it just feels like such a cheap way, inexpensive\n\n1:34:56.740 --> 1:35:03.180\n way to get information about alien life or something interesting that's out there.\n\n1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:08.300\n And I'm not sure if an ice shard from another planetary system will be interesting, but\n\n1:35:08.300 --> 1:35:09.300\n it very well could be.\n\n1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:11.440\n It could be totally new sets of materials.\n\n1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:16.660\n It could be, tell us about composition of planets we don't quite understand.\n\n1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:19.620\n And it's just nice when, especially in the case of a Moa Moa, I guess it was pretty\n\n1:35:19.620 --> 1:35:20.620\n close to earth.\n\n1:35:20.620 --> 1:35:30.260\n It would have been nice to, don't go there, they come to us, I don't know.\n\n1:35:30.260 --> 1:35:31.420\n That's what makes me quite sad.\n\n1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:32.420\n It's a missed opportunity.\n\n1:35:32.420 --> 1:35:34.060\n Well, yeah.\n\n1:35:34.060 --> 1:35:39.100\n And whether you think it's aliens or not, it's a missed opportunity, but we weren't\n\n1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:44.380\n prepared and we will be prepared for the next ones.\n\n1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:49.140\n So there's been a movement in astronomy more towards what's called time domain astronomy.\n\n1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:53.060\n So kind of monitoring the whole sky all the time at all wavelengths.\n\n1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:54.060\n That's kind of the goal.\n\n1:35:54.060 --> 1:35:58.020\n And so we expect to detect many more of these in the future, even though these were the\n\n1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:02.020\n first two we saw, our potential to detect them is only increasing with time.\n\n1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:09.260\n And so there will be more opportunities and based on these two, we now can actually sit\n\n1:36:09.260 --> 1:36:11.860\n and think about what we'll do when the next one shows up.\n\n1:36:11.860 --> 1:36:16.740\n I also, what it made me realize, I know I didn't really think through this, but it made\n\n1:36:16.740 --> 1:36:21.820\n me realize if there is alien civilizations out there, the thing we're most likely to\n\n1:36:21.820 --> 1:36:24.660\n see first would be space junk.\n\n1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:28.300\n My stupid understanding of it.\n\n1:36:28.300 --> 1:36:34.400\n And the second would be really dumb kind of, you could think of maybe like relay nodes\n\n1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:41.980\n or something objects that you need to have a whole lot of for particular purposes of\n\n1:36:41.980 --> 1:36:44.300\n like space travel and so on.\n\n1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:49.180\n Like a speed limit signs or something, I don't know, whatever we have on earth, a lot of\n\n1:36:49.180 --> 1:36:50.180\n that's dumb.\n\n1:36:50.180 --> 1:36:52.660\n It's not alien aliens in themselves.\n\n1:36:52.660 --> 1:36:57.500\n It's like artifacts that are useful to the engineering in the systems that are engineered\n\n1:36:57.500 --> 1:36:59.300\n by alien civilizations.\n\n1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:05.600\n So like it would, we would see a lot of stuff in terms of setting, in terms of looking for\n\n1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:08.140\n alien life and trying to communicate with it.\n\n1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:17.540\n Maybe we should be looking not for like smart creatures or systems to communicate with.\n\n1:37:17.540 --> 1:37:23.540\n Maybe we should be looking for artifacts or even as dumb as like space junk.\n\n1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:29.340\n It just kind of reframed my perspective of like, what are we looking for as signs?\n\n1:37:29.340 --> 1:37:34.060\n Cause there could be a lot of stuff that doesn't have intelligence, but gives us really strong\n\n1:37:34.060 --> 1:37:37.820\n signs that there's somewhere is life or intelligent life.\n\n1:37:37.820 --> 1:37:44.460\n And yeah, that made me kind of, I know it might be dumb to say, but reframe the kind\n\n1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:46.940\n of thing that we should be looking for.\n\n1:37:46.940 --> 1:37:48.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:53.100\n So the benefit of looking for intelligent life is that we perhaps have a better chance\n\n1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:56.260\n of recognizing it.\n\n1:37:56.260 --> 1:38:01.500\n We couldn't necessarily recognize what an alien stop sign look like.\n\n1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:07.080\n And maybe the theorists are the people who sort of model and try to understand slow system\n\n1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:10.220\n objects are pretty good at coming up with models for anything.\n\n1:38:10.220 --> 1:38:15.500\n I mean, maybe a mua mua was a stop sign, but we're clever enough that we could come up\n\n1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:18.220\n with some physical explanations for it.\n\n1:38:18.220 --> 1:38:22.580\n And then we all want to go with the simplest possible, we all want to believe the sort\n\n1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:25.580\n of most skeptical possible explanation.\n\n1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:29.460\n And so we missed it because we're too good at coming up with alternate explanations for\n\n1:38:29.460 --> 1:38:30.460\n things.\n\n1:38:30.460 --> 1:38:35.820\n And it's such an outlier, such a rare phenomenon that we can't study a hundred or a thousand\n\n1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:36.820\n of these objects.\n\n1:38:36.820 --> 1:38:38.140\n We have to, we had just one.\n\n1:38:38.140 --> 1:38:43.620\n And so the science almost destroys the possibility of something special being there.\n\n1:38:43.620 --> 1:38:48.500\n It's like Johnny Ive, this designer of Apple, I don't know if you know who that is.\n\n1:38:48.500 --> 1:38:49.500\n He's the lead designer.\n\n1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:53.260\n He's the person who designed the iPhone and all the major things.\n\n1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:58.260\n And he talked about, he's brilliant, one of my favorite humans on earth and one of the\n\n1:38:58.260 --> 1:39:02.140\n best designers in the history of earth.\n\n1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:07.380\n He talked about like when he had this origins of an idea, like in his baby stages, he would\n\n1:39:07.380 --> 1:39:11.900\n not tell Steve Jobs because Steve would usually like trample all over it.\n\n1:39:11.900 --> 1:39:14.060\n He would say, this is a dumb idea.\n\n1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:19.860\n And so I sometimes think of the scientific community in that sense, because the weapon\n\n1:39:19.860 --> 1:39:26.540\n of the scientific method is so strong at its best that it sometimes crushes the out of\n\n1:39:26.540 --> 1:39:30.580\n the box outlier evidence.\n\n1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:35.020\n We don't get a lot of that evidence because we don't have, we're not lucky enough to have\n\n1:39:35.020 --> 1:39:36.020\n a lot of evidence.\n\n1:39:36.020 --> 1:39:42.780\n So we have to deal with just special cases and special cases could present an inkling\n\n1:39:42.780 --> 1:39:46.900\n of something much bigger, but the scientific method user tramples all over it.\n\n1:39:46.900 --> 1:39:52.260\n And it's hard to know what to do with that because the scientific method works, but at\n\n1:39:52.260 --> 1:39:54.780\n the same time, every once in a while, it's like a balance.\n\n1:39:54.780 --> 1:40:00.380\n You have to do 99% of the time, you have to do like scientific rigor, but every once in\n\n1:40:00.380 --> 1:40:06.300\n a while, this is not you saying, me saying, smoke some weed and sit back and think, I\n\n1:40:06.300 --> 1:40:09.300\n wonder, you know, it's the Joe Rogan thing.\n\n1:40:09.300 --> 1:40:13.980\n It's entirely possible that it's alien space junk.\n\n1:40:13.980 --> 1:40:14.980\n Anyway.\n\n1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:15.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:40:15.980 --> 1:40:16.980\n I think so.\n\n1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:18.380\n I completely agree.\n\n1:40:18.380 --> 1:40:23.580\n And I think that most scientists do speculate about these things.\n\n1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:28.540\n It's just at what point do you act on those things?\n\n1:40:28.540 --> 1:40:33.060\n So you're right that the scientific method has inherent skepticism, and for the most\n\n1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:39.220\n part, that's a good thing because it means that we're not just believing crazy things\n\n1:40:39.220 --> 1:40:41.540\n all the time.\n\n1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:50.040\n But it's an interesting point that requiring that high level of rigor occasionally means\n\n1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:56.540\n that you will miss something that is truly interesting because you needed to verify it\n\n1:40:56.540 --> 1:40:58.620\n three times and it wasn't verifiable.\n\n1:40:58.620 --> 1:41:03.340\n I also think like when you communicate with the general public, I think there's power\n\n1:41:03.340 --> 1:41:10.500\n in that 1% speculation of just demonstrating authenticity as a human being, as a curious\n\n1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:12.540\n human being.\n\n1:41:12.540 --> 1:41:18.940\n I think too often, I think this is changing, but I saw, I've been quite disappointed in\n\n1:41:18.940 --> 1:41:23.160\n my colleagues throughout 2020 with the coronavirus.\n\n1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:28.980\n There's too much speaking from authority as opposed to speaking from curiosity.\n\n1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:32.860\n There's some of the most incredible science has been done in 2020, especially on the virology\n\n1:41:32.860 --> 1:41:34.940\n biology side.\n\n1:41:34.940 --> 1:41:41.860\n And the kind of being talked down to by scientists is always really disappointing to me as opposed\n\n1:41:41.860 --> 1:41:42.860\n to inspiring.\n\n1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:47.820\n Like the things we, there's a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus, but we know a lot of\n\n1:41:47.820 --> 1:41:54.060\n this stuff and we speak from scientists from various disciplines, speak from data in the\n\n1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:56.500\n face of that uncertainty.\n\n1:41:56.500 --> 1:41:58.740\n And we're curious, we don't know what the hell is going on.\n\n1:41:58.740 --> 1:42:02.680\n We don't know if this virus is going to evolve, mutate.\n\n1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:07.900\n We don't know if this virus or the next one might destroy all human civilization.\n\n1:42:07.900 --> 1:42:08.980\n You can't speak with certainty.\n\n1:42:08.980 --> 1:42:16.620\n In fact, I was on a survey paper about masks, something I don't talk much about because\n\n1:42:16.620 --> 1:42:22.020\n I don't like politics, but we don't know if masks work, but there's a lot of evidence\n\n1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:24.140\n to show that they work for this particular virus.\n\n1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:27.780\n The transmission of the virus is fascinating actually.\n\n1:42:27.780 --> 1:42:33.480\n The biomechanics of the way viruses spread is fascinating.\n\n1:42:33.480 --> 1:42:36.340\n If it wasn't destructive, it would be beautiful.\n\n1:42:36.340 --> 1:42:42.180\n And we don't know, but it's inspiring to apply the scientific method to the best of our ability,\n\n1:42:42.180 --> 1:42:47.300\n but also to show that you don't always know everything and to, perhaps not about the virus\n\n1:42:47.300 --> 1:42:51.020\n as much, but other things speculate.\n\n1:42:51.020 --> 1:42:57.540\n What if, you know, what if it's the worst case and the best case?\n\n1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:00.760\n Because that's ultimately what we are, descendants of apes that are just curious about the world\n\n1:43:00.760 --> 1:43:01.760\n around us.\n\n1:43:01.760 --> 1:43:11.980\n Yeah, I'll just add to that, not on the topic of masks, but on the topic of curiosity.\n\n1:43:11.980 --> 1:43:19.300\n I mean, I think that's, astronomy and planetary sciences, a field are a little, are unique\n\n1:43:19.300 --> 1:43:26.420\n because for better and for worse, they don't directly impact humanity.\n\n1:43:26.420 --> 1:43:34.300\n So you know, we're not studying virology to prevent transmission of, you know, illness\n\n1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:35.380\n amongst humans.\n\n1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:40.180\n We're not characterizing volcanoes on earth that could destroy cities.\n\n1:43:40.180 --> 1:43:49.780\n We, it really is a more curious and in my opinion, playful scientific field than many.\n\n1:43:49.780 --> 1:43:54.860\n So for better and worse, we can kind of afford to pursue some of the speculation more because\n\n1:43:54.860 --> 1:44:00.420\n human lives are not in danger if we speculate a little bit too freely and get something\n\n1:44:00.420 --> 1:44:01.420\n wrong.\n\n1:44:01.420 --> 1:44:03.520\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:09.940\n In the space of AI, I am worried that we're sometimes too eager, speaking for myself,\n\n1:44:09.940 --> 1:44:14.900\n to like flip the switch to on just to see like what happens.\n\n1:44:14.900 --> 1:44:19.260\n Maybe sometimes we want to be a little bit careful about that because bad things might\n\n1:44:19.260 --> 1:44:21.180\n happen.\n\n1:44:21.180 --> 1:44:27.940\n Is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that were inspiring, had an\n\n1:44:27.940 --> 1:44:30.300\n impact on you that you would recommend?\n\n1:44:30.300 --> 1:44:31.860\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:44:31.860 --> 1:44:35.580\n So many that I just don't know where to start with it.\n\n1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:37.140\n So I love reading.\n\n1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:38.340\n I read obsessively.\n\n1:44:38.340 --> 1:44:43.080\n I've been reading fiction and a little bit of nonfiction, but mostly fiction obsessively\n\n1:44:43.080 --> 1:44:47.820\n since I was a child and just never stopped.\n\n1:44:47.820 --> 1:44:50.140\n So I have some favorite books.\n\n1:44:50.140 --> 1:44:51.780\n None of them are easy readings.\n\n1:44:51.780 --> 1:44:56.580\n So I definitely, I mean, I recommend them for somebody who likes an intellectual challenge\n\n1:44:56.580 --> 1:44:59.980\n in the books that they read.\n\n1:44:59.980 --> 1:45:02.900\n So maybe I should go chronologically.\n\n1:45:02.900 --> 1:45:04.580\n I have at least three.\n\n1:45:04.580 --> 1:45:07.340\n I'm not going to go through 50 here.\n\n1:45:07.340 --> 1:45:14.980\n Yeah, I'd love to also like maybe ideas that you took away from what you mentioned.\n\n1:45:14.980 --> 1:45:15.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:15.980 --> 1:45:16.980\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:16.980 --> 1:45:20.300\n Why they were so compelling to me.\n\n1:45:20.300 --> 1:45:27.580\n One of the first books that really captured my fascination was Nabokov's book Pale Fire.\n\n1:45:27.580 --> 1:45:29.380\n Are you familiar with it?\n\n1:45:29.380 --> 1:45:34.560\n So I read it actually for a class.\n\n1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:39.820\n It's one of the few books I've ever read for a class that I actually really liked.\n\n1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:44.680\n And the book is, it's in some sense a puzzle.\n\n1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:52.320\n He's a brilliant writer, of course, but the book is like, it's formatted like a poem.\n\n1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:59.460\n So there's an introduction, a very long poem and footnotes, and you get partway through\n\n1:45:59.460 --> 1:46:04.020\n it before realizing that the whole thing is actually a novel, unless you sort of read\n\n1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:05.020\n up on it going in.\n\n1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:10.820\n But the whole thing is a novel and there's a story that slowly reveals itself over the\n\n1:46:10.820 --> 1:46:21.320\n course of all of this and kind of reveals this just fascinating character basically\n\n1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:24.100\n and how his mind works in this story.\n\n1:46:24.100 --> 1:46:31.020\n The idea of a novel also being a kind of intellectual puzzle and something that slowly reveals itself\n\n1:46:31.020 --> 1:46:36.460\n over the course of reading was really fascinating to me and I have since found a lot more writers\n\n1:46:36.460 --> 1:46:38.140\n like that.\n\n1:46:38.140 --> 1:46:44.760\n In a contemporary example that comes to mind is Kazuo Ishiguro, who's pretty much all of\n\n1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:49.600\n his books are like slow reveals over the course of the book and like nothing much happens\n\n1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:54.280\n in the books, but you keep reading them because you just want to know like what the reality\n\n1:46:54.280 --> 1:46:57.660\n is that he's slowly revealing to you.\n\n1:46:57.660 --> 1:47:02.220\n The kind of discovery oriented reading maybe.\n\n1:47:02.220 --> 1:47:04.140\n What's the second one?\n\n1:47:04.140 --> 1:47:08.100\n Perhaps my favorite writer is Renier Maria Rilke.\n\n1:47:08.100 --> 1:47:09.100\n Wow.\n\n1:47:09.100 --> 1:47:11.100\n Are you familiar with him?\n\n1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:13.140\n No, also not familiar.\n\n1:47:13.140 --> 1:47:14.140\n You're hitting hidden ones.\n\n1:47:14.140 --> 1:47:19.420\n I mean, I know in the book of Well, but I've never read Pale Fire, but Rilke, I've never,\n\n1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:22.900\n I know it's a very difficult read, I know that much.\n\n1:47:22.900 --> 1:47:23.900\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:47:23.900 --> 1:47:25.220\n All of these are difficult reads.\n\n1:47:25.220 --> 1:47:33.740\n I think I just, I read for in part for an intellectual challenge, but Rilke, so he wrote\n\n1:47:33.740 --> 1:47:38.060\n one thing that might be characterizable as a novel, but he wrote a lot of poetry.\n\n1:47:38.060 --> 1:47:43.760\n I mean, he wrote this series of poems called the Duino Elegies that were very impactful\n\n1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:53.260\n for me personally, just emotionally, which actually it kind of ties in with astronomy\n\n1:47:53.260 --> 1:48:01.660\n in that there's a sense in which we're all going through our lives alone and there's\n\n1:48:01.660 --> 1:48:10.100\n just this sense of profound loneliness in the existence of every individual human.\n\n1:48:10.100 --> 1:48:18.540\n I think I was drawn to astronomy in part because the sort of vast spaces, the kind of loneliness\n\n1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:24.660\n and desolateness of space made the sort of internal loneliness feel okay.\n\n1:48:24.660 --> 1:48:32.220\n In a sense, it like gave companionship and that's how I feel about Rilke's poetry.\n\n1:48:32.220 --> 1:48:40.920\n He turns the kind of desolation and loneliness of human existence into something joyful and\n\n1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:42.580\n almost meaningful.\n\n1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:48.860\n Yeah, there's something about melancholy, I don't know about Rilke in general, but like\n\n1:48:48.860 --> 1:49:00.860\n contemplating the melancholy nature of the human condition that makes it okay.\n\n1:49:00.860 --> 1:49:05.940\n I got gentle from an engineering perspective, think that there is so much loneliness we\n\n1:49:05.940 --> 1:49:12.100\n haven't explored within ourselves yet and that's my hope is to build AI systems that\n\n1:49:12.100 --> 1:49:15.580\n help us explore our own loneliness.\n\n1:49:15.580 --> 1:49:22.020\n I think that's kind of what love is and friendship is, is somebody who in a very small way helps\n\n1:49:22.020 --> 1:49:28.860\n us explore our own loneliness, like they listen, we connect like two lonely creatures connect\n\n1:49:28.860 --> 1:49:38.100\n for a time and it's like, oh, like acknowledge that we exist together for a brief time, but\n\n1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:43.260\n in a somewhat shallow way, I think relative to how much it's possible to truly connect\n\n1:49:43.260 --> 1:49:44.540\n as two consciousnesses.\n\n1:49:44.540 --> 1:49:48.980\n So AI might be able to help on that front.\n\n1:49:48.980 --> 1:49:49.980\n So what's the third one?\n\n1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:54.100\n Actually, you know, I hadn't realized until this moment, but it's yet another one of these\n\n1:49:54.100 --> 1:49:57.160\n kind of slow reveal books.\n\n1:49:57.160 --> 1:50:05.620\n It's a contemporary Russian, I think Russian American writer named Olga Grushin and she\n\n1:50:05.620 --> 1:50:12.660\n wrote this just phenomenal book called The Dream Life of Sukhanov that I read this year.\n\n1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:18.380\n Maybe it was last year for the first time and it's just a really beautiful, this one\n\n1:50:18.380 --> 1:50:26.060\n you could call a character study, I think of a Russian father coming to terms with himself\n\n1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:33.660\n and his own past as he potentially slowly loses his mind.\n\n1:50:33.660 --> 1:50:36.620\n Slow reveal.\n\n1:50:36.620 --> 1:50:37.620\n Slow reveal.\n\n1:50:37.620 --> 1:50:39.740\n Well, that's apparent from the beginning.\n\n1:50:39.740 --> 1:50:43.740\n I hope I don't think it's a spoiler.\n\n1:50:43.740 --> 1:50:44.740\n Decline into madness.\n\n1:50:44.740 --> 1:50:45.740\n Spoiler alert.\n\n1:50:45.740 --> 1:50:47.540\n So all of these are really heavy.\n\n1:50:47.540 --> 1:50:48.540\n I don't know.\n\n1:50:48.540 --> 1:50:50.540\n I just, I don't have anything lighter to recommend.\n\n1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:53.620\n Ishiguro is the light version of this.\n\n1:50:53.620 --> 1:50:54.620\n Okay.\n\n1:50:54.620 --> 1:50:58.500\n Well, heavy has a certain kind of beauty to it in itself.\n\n1:50:58.500 --> 1:51:03.100\n Is there advice you would give to a young person today that looks up to the stars and\n\n1:51:03.100 --> 1:51:05.160\n wonders what the heck they want to do with their life?\n\n1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:15.180\n So career, science, life in general, you've for now chosen a certain kind of path of curiosity.\n\n1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:20.340\n What insights do you draw from that that you can give us advice to others?\n\n1:51:20.340 --> 1:51:27.940\n I think for somebody, I would not presume to speak to giving people advice on life and\n\n1:51:27.940 --> 1:51:33.820\n humanity overall, but for somebody thinking of being a scientist.\n\n1:51:33.820 --> 1:51:40.060\n So there are a couple of things, one sort of practical thing, which is career wise,\n\n1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:47.780\n I hadn't appreciated this going into science, but you need to, so the questions you're working\n\n1:51:47.780 --> 1:51:55.260\n on and the techniques you use are both of very high importance, maybe equal importance\n\n1:51:55.260 --> 1:51:58.060\n for being happy in your career.\n\n1:51:58.060 --> 1:52:01.660\n If there are questions you're interested in, but the techniques that you need to use to\n\n1:52:01.660 --> 1:52:07.700\n do them are tedious for you, then your job is going to be miserable even if the questions\n\n1:52:07.700 --> 1:52:09.100\n are inspiring.\n\n1:52:09.100 --> 1:52:14.980\n So you have to find, but if the techniques that you use are things that excite you, then\n\n1:52:14.980 --> 1:52:16.700\n your job is fun every day.\n\n1:52:16.700 --> 1:52:22.100\n So for me, I'm fascinated by the solar system and I love telescopes and I love doing data\n\n1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:25.620\n analysis, playing with data from telescopes, coming up with new ways to use telescopes\n\n1:52:25.620 --> 1:52:28.100\n and so that's where I have found that mesh.\n\n1:52:28.100 --> 1:52:32.740\n But if I was interested in, you know, the dynamical evolution of the solar system, how\n\n1:52:32.740 --> 1:52:36.900\n the orbits of things evolve, then I would need to do a different type of work that I\n\n1:52:36.900 --> 1:52:39.800\n would just not find as appealing and so it just wouldn't be a good fit.\n\n1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:44.980\n And so it sort of seems like an unromantic thing to have to think about the techniques\n\n1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:49.100\n being the thing you want to work on also, but it really makes a profound difference\n\n1:52:49.100 --> 1:52:52.300\n for I think your happiness and your scientific career.\n\n1:52:52.300 --> 1:52:53.300\n I think that's really profound.\n\n1:52:53.300 --> 1:52:56.300\n It's like the thing, the menial tasks.\n\n1:52:56.300 --> 1:53:00.300\n If you enjoy those, that's a really good sign that that's the right path for you.\n\n1:53:00.300 --> 1:53:06.420\n I think David Foster Wallace said that the key to life is to be unborable.\n\n1:53:06.420 --> 1:53:09.700\n So basically everything should be exciting.\n\n1:53:09.700 --> 1:53:15.220\n I don't think that's feasible, but you should find an area where everything is exciting.\n\n1:53:15.220 --> 1:53:20.180\n I mean, depending on the day, but you could find the joy in everything, not just the big\n\n1:53:20.180 --> 1:53:28.860\n exciting things that everyone thinks is exciting, but the details, the repetitive stuff, the\n\n1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:32.980\n menial stuff, the stuff that takes years, the stuff that involves a lot of failure and\n\n1:53:32.980 --> 1:53:35.460\n all those kinds of things that you find that enjoyable.\n\n1:53:35.460 --> 1:53:40.800\n That's actually really profound to focus on that because people talk about like dreams\n\n1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:44.500\n and passion and goals and so on, the big thing, but that's not actually what takes you there.\n\n1:53:44.500 --> 1:53:49.340\n What takes you there is every single day, putting in the hours, and that's what actually\n\n1:53:49.340 --> 1:53:51.980\n makes up life is the boring bits.\n\n1:53:51.980 --> 1:54:00.040\n If the boring bits aren't boring, then that's an exciting life because when you were talking\n\n1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:06.500\n so romantically and passionately about IO, I remember the poem by Robert Frost.\n\n1:54:06.500 --> 1:54:11.500\n So let me ask you, let me read the poem and ask what your opinion is.\n\n1:54:11.500 --> 1:54:12.860\n That's called Fire and Ice.\n\n1:54:12.860 --> 1:54:13.860\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:54:13.860 --> 1:54:16.420\n I could almost recite this from memory.\n\n1:54:16.420 --> 1:54:18.300\n Some say the world will end in fire.\n\n1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:19.300\n Some say in ice.\n\n1:54:19.300 --> 1:54:23.600\n From what I've tasted of desire, I hold with those who favor fire.\n\n1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:29.180\n But if I had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate to say that for destruction\n\n1:54:29.180 --> 1:54:33.020\n ice is also great and would suffice.\n\n1:54:33.020 --> 1:54:41.380\n So let me ask, if you had to only choose one, would you choose the world to end in fire,\n\n1:54:41.380 --> 1:54:51.180\n in volcanic eruptions, in heat and magma, or in ice, frozen over?\n\n1:54:51.180 --> 1:54:52.180\n Fire or ice?\n\n1:54:52.180 --> 1:54:53.180\n Fire.\n\n1:54:53.180 --> 1:54:54.180\n Excellent choice.\n\n1:54:54.180 --> 1:55:10.660\n I've always been a fan of chaos and the idea of things just slowly getting cold and stopping\n\n1:55:10.660 --> 1:55:14.820\n and dying is just so depressing to me.\n\n1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:20.800\n So much more depressing than things blowing up or burning or getting covered by a lava\n\n1:55:20.800 --> 1:55:21.800\n flow.\n\n1:55:21.800 --> 1:55:27.500\n Somehow the activity of it endows it with more meaning to me, maybe.\n\n1:55:27.500 --> 1:55:32.100\n I've just now had this vision of you in action films where you're walking away without looking\n\n1:55:32.100 --> 1:55:38.420\n back and this explosion's behind you and you put on shades and then it goes to credits.\n\n1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:45.780\n Catherine, this is awesome, I think your work is really inspiring.\n\n1:55:45.780 --> 1:55:50.340\n The kind of things we'll discover about planets in the next few decades is super cool and\n\n1:55:50.340 --> 1:55:55.620\n I hope, I know you said there's probably not life in one of them, but there might be and\n\n1:55:55.620 --> 1:55:58.380\n I hope we discover just that.\n\n1:55:58.380 --> 1:56:04.020\n And perhaps even on Io, within the volcanic eruptions, there's a little creature hanging\n\n1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.340\n on that we'll one day discover.\n\n1:56:06.340 --> 1:56:10.620\n Thank you so much for wasting all your valuable time with me today, it was really awesome.\n\n1:56:10.620 --> 1:56:14.340\n Yeah, likewise, thank you for having me here.\n\n1:56:14.340 --> 1:56:19.140\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Catherine Duclear and thank you to Fundrise,\n\n1:56:19.140 --> 1:56:23.180\n Blinkist, ExpressVPN and Magic Spoon.\n\n1:56:23.180 --> 1:56:26.460\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:29.740\n And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.\n\n1:56:29.740 --> 1:56:34.500\n On Titan, the molecules that have been raining down like mana from heaven for the last four\n\n1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:41.180\n billion years might still be there, largely unaltered, deep frozen, awaiting for the chemists\n\n1:56:41.180 --> 1:56:42.800\n from Earth.\n\n1:56:42.800 --> 1:57:04.940\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
