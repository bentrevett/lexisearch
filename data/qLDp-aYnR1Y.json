00:04.980\n and their environment?\n\n00:04.980 --> 00:06.540\n How are they interacting with each other?\n\n00:06.540 --> 00:08.620\n So can we look at these and how they're interacting\n\n00:08.620 --> 00:10.540\n perhaps as a swarm?\n\n00:10.540 --> 00:12.100\n Especially off the East Coast where this is happening\n\n00:12.100 --> 00:14.500\n all the time with multiple objects.\n\n00:16.700 --> 00:18.180\n The following is a conversation\n\n00:18.180 --> 00:19.980\n with Lieutenant Ryan Graves,\n\n00:19.980 --> 00:22.020\n former Navy fighter pilot,\n\n00:22.020 --> 00:24.100\n including roles as a combat lead,\n\n00:24.100 --> 00:28.460\n landing signals officer and rescue mission commander.\n\n00:28.460 --> 00:31.780\n He and people in his squadron detected UFOs\n\n00:31.780 --> 00:33.340\n on multiple occasions.\n\n00:33.340 --> 00:35.940\n And he has been one of the few people\n\n00:35.940 --> 00:38.660\n willing to speak publicly about these experiences\n\n00:38.660 --> 00:42.260\n and about the importance of investigating these sightings,\n\n00:42.260 --> 00:45.500\n especially for national security reasons.\n\n00:45.500 --> 00:48.860\n Ryan has a degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering\n\n00:48.860 --> 00:52.540\n from WPI and an interest in career roles\n\n00:52.540 --> 00:54.420\n in advanced technology development,\n\n00:54.420 --> 00:57.540\n including multiagent collaborative autonomy,\n\n00:57.540 --> 01:00.180\n machine learning assisted air to air combat,\n\n01:00.180 --> 01:03.220\n manned and unmanned teaming technologies,\n\n01:03.220 --> 01:05.820\n and most recently, development of materials\n\n01:05.820 --> 01:08.220\n through quantum simulation.\n\n01:08.220 --> 01:10.260\n This is a Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:10.260 --> 01:12.460\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:12.460 --> 01:13.820\n in the description.\n\n01:13.820 --> 01:17.180\n And now, dear friends, here's Ryan Graves.\n\n01:18.220 --> 01:20.460\n What did you think of the new Top Gun movie?\n\n01:20.460 --> 01:21.740\n How accurate was it?\n\n01:21.740 --> 01:22.940\n Let's start there.\n\n01:22.940 --> 01:25.660\n I thought the flying was really accurate.\n\n01:25.660 --> 01:28.260\n I thought the type of flying they did\n\n01:28.260 --> 01:30.320\n and how they approached the actual mission,\n\n01:31.340 --> 01:33.380\n of course, had a lot of liberties.\n\n01:33.380 --> 01:35.500\n But one thing that seems to be hard to capture\n\n01:35.500 --> 01:38.340\n on these types of things are the chess game that's going on\n\n01:38.340 --> 01:40.380\n while that type of flying is happening.\n\n01:40.380 --> 01:42.900\n The chess game between, like in a dog fight,\n\n01:42.900 --> 01:45.540\n between the pilots and the enemy,\n\n01:45.540 --> 01:47.460\n or between the different pilots?\n\n01:47.460 --> 01:49.500\n I'll even speak to just that particular mission.\n\n01:49.500 --> 01:50.340\n They flew there.\n\n01:50.340 --> 01:52.220\n And for that particular mission,\n\n01:52.220 --> 01:54.980\n it's kind of a chess game with yourself\n\n01:54.980 --> 01:56.460\n to get everything in place.\n\n01:56.460 --> 01:59.060\n So what kind of flight they flew\n\n01:59.060 --> 02:00.820\n is called a high threat scenario,\n\n02:00.820 --> 02:02.900\n which means they have to ingress low\n\n02:02.900 --> 02:05.100\n due to the surface to air threats,\n\n02:05.100 --> 02:08.020\n the integrated air defense systems that are nearby.\n\n02:08.020 --> 02:09.700\n And they have to ingress low and pop up\n\n02:09.700 --> 02:11.300\n like we see in the movie.\n\n02:11.300 --> 02:12.460\n And in that particular movie,\n\n02:12.460 --> 02:13.900\n that was a preplanned strike.\n\n02:13.900 --> 02:15.620\n They knew exactly where they were going.\n\n02:15.620 --> 02:17.660\n But there's a scenario where we have to operate\n\n02:17.660 --> 02:18.640\n in that type of environment,\n\n02:18.640 --> 02:20.720\n and we don't know exactly where we're going to strike\n\n02:20.720 --> 02:23.400\n or we're going to be adapting to real time targets.\n\n02:23.400 --> 02:25.100\n And so in that scenario, you would have\n\n02:25.100 --> 02:26.900\n one of those fighters down low like that\n\n02:26.900 --> 02:28.780\n operating as a mission commander,\n\n02:28.780 --> 02:30.340\n as a forward air controller.\n\n02:30.340 --> 02:32.160\n And he's out there calling shots,\n\n02:32.160 --> 02:33.540\n joining on those other players\n\n02:33.540 --> 02:35.660\n in order to ensure they're pointed at the right target.\n\n02:35.660 --> 02:38.780\n So that's a bit of the chess game that he'll be playing.\n\n02:38.780 --> 02:40.180\n Can you actually describe for people\n\n02:40.180 --> 02:43.460\n who haven't seen the movie what the mission actually is?\n\n02:43.460 --> 02:44.280\n Yeah.\n\n02:44.280 --> 02:45.140\n What's involved in the mission?\n\n02:45.140 --> 02:47.260\n So in this particular mission,\n\n02:47.260 --> 02:49.520\n it's kind of what we would call a preplanned strike.\n\n02:49.520 --> 02:51.000\n So there's a known location\n\n02:51.000 --> 02:53.380\n that's in a heavily defended area.\n\n02:53.380 --> 02:55.540\n And the air crew, in this case,\n\n02:55.540 --> 02:59.540\n I believe it was four F18s on the initial package,\n\n02:59.540 --> 03:02.580\n their job was to ingress very low down a canyon\n\n03:02.580 --> 03:05.020\n to stay out of the radar window of the surface\n\n03:05.020 --> 03:06.220\n to air threats.\n\n03:06.220 --> 03:07.740\n What does ingress mean?\n\n03:07.740 --> 03:09.740\n Ingress means that they're going to be pushing\n\n03:09.740 --> 03:13.040\n from a start location towards the target or the objective.\n\n03:13.040 --> 03:15.060\n So there's an ingress portion of the mission\n\n03:15.060 --> 03:16.500\n and an egress portion of the mission.\n\n03:16.500 --> 03:18.860\n Oh, okay.\n\n03:18.860 --> 03:21.180\n Like the entrance and the exit type of thing.\n\n03:21.180 --> 03:22.020\n Got it.\n\n03:22.020 --> 03:24.540\n But it changes our mindset tactically quite a bit, right?\n\n03:24.540 --> 03:26.020\n Cause when we're entering someplace,\n\n03:26.020 --> 03:27.900\n we have the option to enter.\n\n03:27.900 --> 03:31.340\n But when we go drop a bomb on location, we're exiting.\n\n03:31.340 --> 03:32.820\n We don't have that luxury.\n\n03:32.820 --> 03:33.780\n We don't have that option.\n\n03:33.780 --> 03:37.420\n So it actually changes our tactics and our aggression level.\n\n03:37.420 --> 03:38.260\n Got it.\n\n03:38.260 --> 03:40.340\n And so they were flying low to the ground\n\n03:40.340 --> 03:43.840\n and then there's a surface to air missiles\n\n03:43.840 --> 03:47.140\n that forced them to have to fly low.\n\n03:47.140 --> 03:48.580\n Is that a realistic thing?\n\n03:48.580 --> 03:49.740\n It is realistic.\n\n03:49.740 --> 03:52.220\n So driving those aircraft in the clutter,\n\n03:52.220 --> 03:54.900\n you know, all radar systems or most I should say\n\n03:54.900 --> 03:57.260\n are essentially line of sight.\n\n03:57.260 --> 03:59.140\n And so they're going to be limited by the horizon\n\n03:59.140 --> 04:00.660\n or any clutter out there.\n\n04:00.660 --> 04:03.840\n And even a number of radars, if they are located up high\n\n04:03.840 --> 04:06.660\n and looking down towards that aircraft,\n\n04:06.660 --> 04:11.460\n the clutter or all the objects such as trees and canyons\n\n04:11.460 --> 04:13.500\n can have effect on radar systems.\n\n04:13.500 --> 04:16.260\n And so it can be a type of camouflage.\n\n04:16.260 --> 04:17.860\n So that's a camouflage for the radar,\n\n04:17.860 --> 04:21.220\n but what about the surface to air missile?\n\n04:21.220 --> 04:25.780\n Is that a legitimate way to avoid missiles flies so low,\n\n04:25.780 --> 04:30.180\n like fly I guess below their level?\n\n04:31.060 --> 04:32.340\n As far as I know, you know,\n\n04:32.340 --> 04:34.500\n you can fly under any radar right now.\n\n04:34.500 --> 04:36.200\n We don't have necessarily radars\n\n04:36.200 --> 04:37.940\n that can look through anything.\n\n04:37.940 --> 04:41.660\n So there is always going to be the ability to mask yourself,\n\n04:41.660 --> 04:43.460\n but with a larger number of assets\n\n04:43.460 --> 04:45.740\n and distributed communication networks,\n\n04:45.740 --> 04:47.540\n where those radars are looking,\n\n04:47.540 --> 04:48.500\n it makes all the difference.\n\n04:48.500 --> 04:51.020\n And I said, they're ingressing past an IAS\n\n04:51.020 --> 04:52.980\n and that's an integrated air defense system.\n\n04:52.980 --> 04:55.600\n And that linking of air defense systems\n\n04:55.600 --> 04:58.980\n is what makes it so hard, so complicated\n\n04:58.980 --> 05:00.600\n is that the sensors and the weapons\n\n05:00.600 --> 05:02.420\n are disassociated from each other.\n\n05:02.420 --> 05:06.100\n So that if you took out the target that was shooting at you,\n\n05:06.100 --> 05:09.160\n it still has ability to intercept you\n\n05:09.160 --> 05:11.500\n from another radar location.\n\n05:11.500 --> 05:14.960\n So it's distributed and it's stronger that way.\n\n05:14.960 --> 05:17.540\n You mean the surface to air missiles,\n\n05:18.420 --> 05:20.820\n like it's a distributed system\n\n05:20.820 --> 05:22.660\n in that if you take out one,\n\n05:22.660 --> 05:26.060\n they're still able to sort of integrate information\n\n05:26.060 --> 05:28.260\n about your location and strike at you.\n\n05:28.260 --> 05:29.100\n Correct.\n\n05:29.100 --> 05:30.840\n And there's a lot of complication that can go,\n\n05:30.840 --> 05:32.100\n you know, once we start thinking about\n\n05:32.100 --> 05:33.460\n distributed systems like that\n\n05:33.460 --> 05:35.500\n and the ability to self heal and repair\n\n05:35.500 --> 05:39.900\n and adapt to losses, it's an interesting area.\n\n05:39.900 --> 05:41.860\n Are you responsible for thinking about that\n\n05:41.860 --> 05:43.460\n when you're flying an airplane?\n\n05:43.460 --> 05:47.060\n To some degree, when we ingress to an area like that,\n\n05:47.060 --> 05:50.060\n we're presented with information about targets,\n\n05:50.060 --> 05:52.080\n air to air or air to surface,\n\n05:52.080 --> 05:54.060\n or surface to air, I should say.\n\n05:54.060 --> 05:57.700\n And we can essentially see where essentially\n\n05:57.700 --> 06:00.420\n the danger zone, if you will, is located.\n\n06:00.420 --> 06:02.340\n And so essentially we would stay out of that.\n\n06:02.340 --> 06:05.860\n And so having a full picture of the environment\n\n06:05.860 --> 06:07.940\n is extremely important because, you know,\n\n06:07.940 --> 06:09.300\n at the end of the day, if we go in that circle,\n\n06:09.300 --> 06:10.480\n we can die pretty quickly.\n\n06:10.480 --> 06:12.740\n So it's absolutely crucial.\n\n06:12.740 --> 06:16.300\n So there's regions that have higher and lower danger\n\n06:16.300 --> 06:17.940\n based on your understanding of the actual,\n\n06:17.940 --> 06:22.060\n whatever the surface to air missiles systems are.\n\n06:22.060 --> 06:24.220\n So you can kind of know.\n\n06:24.220 --> 06:25.100\n That's interesting.\n\n06:25.100 --> 06:26.940\n I wonder how automated that could be too,\n\n06:26.940 --> 06:29.380\n especially when you don't know.\n\n06:29.380 --> 06:30.820\n It seems like in the movie they knew\n\n06:30.820 --> 06:32.180\n the location of everything.\n\n06:33.060 --> 06:37.460\n I imagine that's less known in most cases.\n\n06:37.460 --> 06:39.760\n And also, a lot of those systems\n\n06:39.760 --> 06:41.820\n might be a little bit more ghetto\n\n06:41.820 --> 06:43.580\n if I can use that technical term.\n\n06:43.580 --> 06:47.180\n Like I've gotten, ad hoc maybe is the,\n\n06:47.180 --> 06:49.340\n I don't know.\n\n06:49.340 --> 06:52.340\n But having just recently visited Ukraine\n\n06:52.340 --> 06:55.340\n and seen a lot of aspects of the way that war is fought,\n\n06:55.340 --> 06:58.100\n there's a lot of improvised type of systems.\n\n06:58.100 --> 07:01.900\n So you take high tech, like advanced technology,\n\n07:01.900 --> 07:04.260\n but the way you deploy it and the way you organize it\n\n07:04.260 --> 07:08.620\n is very improvised and ad hoc and is responding\n\n07:08.620 --> 07:11.260\n to the uncertainty and the dynamic environment.\n\n07:11.260 --> 07:13.860\n And so from an enemy perspective\n\n07:13.860 --> 07:16.740\n or whoever's trying to deal with that kind of system,\n\n07:16.740 --> 07:17.840\n it's hard to figure it out.\n\n07:17.840 --> 07:22.060\n Because it's like me, I played tennis for a long time\n\n07:22.060 --> 07:24.060\n and it's always easier to play,\n\n07:24.060 --> 07:25.820\n this is true for all sports,\n\n07:25.820 --> 07:27.380\n play tennis against a good tennis player\n\n07:27.380 --> 07:29.220\n versus a crappy tennis player.\n\n07:29.220 --> 07:32.500\n Because the crappy tennis player is full of uncertainty.\n\n07:32.500 --> 07:34.340\n And that's really difficult to deal with.\n\n07:34.340 --> 07:36.060\n It seemed like in the movie the systems\n\n07:36.060 --> 07:38.980\n were really well organized.\n\n07:38.980 --> 07:40.900\n And so you could plan.\n\n07:40.900 --> 07:41.940\n And there's a very nice ravine\n\n07:41.940 --> 07:43.380\n that went right down the middle of them.\n\n07:43.380 --> 07:44.820\n That's how movies work, isn't it?\n\n07:44.820 --> 07:45.660\n Yeah.\n\n07:45.660 --> 07:47.320\n But no, I absolutely agree.\n\n07:47.320 --> 07:50.580\n So what you say is a very good point.\n\n07:50.580 --> 07:54.540\n And if we were to take a chunk of airspace\n\n07:54.540 --> 07:56.360\n and break it up into little bits,\n\n07:56.360 --> 07:58.060\n there'd be places that are better to fly\n\n07:58.060 --> 08:00.260\n or less good to fly.\n\n08:00.260 --> 08:02.620\n And we are seeing that now\n\n08:02.620 --> 08:05.300\n with what they call manned unmanned teaming.\n\n08:05.300 --> 08:08.520\n We see tactical aircraft or some type of aircraft\n\n08:08.520 --> 08:11.140\n or platform that's being automated.\n\n08:11.140 --> 08:13.580\n And it's not being automated in traditional sense\n\n08:13.580 --> 08:15.540\n where people think aircrew are flying them around\n\n08:15.540 --> 08:16.360\n to conduct missions.\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:20.220\n But it's very high level objective orientated\n\n08:20.220 --> 08:22.620\n mission planning that allows the aircrew\n\n08:22.620 --> 08:25.660\n to act more as a mission planner,\n\n08:25.660 --> 08:27.820\n mission commander versus having to just pick\n\n08:27.820 --> 08:29.700\n the right assets or fly them around\n\n08:29.700 --> 08:34.020\n or manipulate them somewhat physically.\n\n08:34.020 --> 08:36.020\n So actually going back to the chess thing,\n\n08:36.020 --> 08:37.500\n can you elaborate on what you mean\n\n08:37.500 --> 08:40.260\n by playing a game of chess with yourself?\n\n08:40.260 --> 08:42.380\n What's, when you're flying that mission,\n\n08:42.380 --> 08:43.780\n what exactly do you mean by that?\n\n08:43.780 --> 08:46.100\n Well, there's a few people you're usually fighting against\n\n08:46.100 --> 08:48.180\n in the air, you know, there's the bad guys\n\n08:48.180 --> 08:52.340\n and then there's physics and mother nature, right?\n\n08:52.340 --> 08:56.500\n So when we're down at about 100 feet,\n\n08:56.500 --> 08:58.660\n it's a chess game to stay alive for the pilot\n\n08:58.660 --> 09:00.220\n and it's a chess game for the whizzo\n\n09:00.220 --> 09:02.660\n to process the information he needs\n\n09:02.660 --> 09:04.880\n and then communicate it to all those other aircraft\n\n09:04.880 --> 09:06.460\n that were flying around to ensure\n\n09:06.460 --> 09:08.420\n that they're putting their weapons on the right target.\n\n09:08.420 --> 09:09.580\n What's the whizzo?\n\n09:09.580 --> 09:11.380\n Wizzo is a weapons systems officer.\n\n09:11.380 --> 09:13.600\n He's a backseater who is not a pilot,\n\n09:13.600 --> 09:16.020\n but they're responsible for radar manipulation\n\n09:16.020 --> 09:19.100\n and communications and weapons appointments\n\n09:19.100 --> 09:19.940\n of certain natures.\n\n09:19.940 --> 09:22.140\n So the chess game is against physics,\n\n09:22.140 --> 09:23.220\n against the enemy.\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:25.760\n Time.\n\n09:25.760 --> 09:30.760\n Time, what about your own psychology, fear, uncertainty?\n\n09:31.180 --> 09:32.020\n No.\n\n09:32.020 --> 09:35.340\n No, there's no time for that type of self reflection\n\n09:35.340 --> 09:36.740\n while we're flying.\n\n09:36.740 --> 09:41.100\n I want to get to that, but I don't want to forget\n\n09:41.100 --> 09:43.180\n the point that you made about increased randomness\n\n09:43.180 --> 09:45.500\n being a tactical advantage.\n\n09:45.500 --> 09:47.920\n You know, as we, as you mentioned, you know,\n\n09:47.920 --> 09:49.780\n you can introduce autonomy into there\n\n09:49.780 --> 09:51.940\n and when you bring autonomy in there\n\n09:51.940 --> 09:55.180\n and my expectation would be as we bring different abilities\n\n09:55.180 --> 09:57.540\n and machine learning, as we gather more data,\n\n09:57.540 --> 10:00.700\n we're going to be able to bring the tactical environment\n\n10:00.700 --> 10:03.100\n around that jet, the war space that it goes into\n\n10:03.100 --> 10:05.540\n will almost be at a stochastic level from the enemy's\n\n10:05.540 --> 10:08.100\n perspective, where it'll almost seem like\n\n10:08.100 --> 10:10.720\n every tactical environment they go in will be random\n\n10:10.720 --> 10:13.980\n and yet very deadly because the system is providing\n\n10:13.980 --> 10:17.620\n a new tactical solution essentially\n\n10:17.620 --> 10:18.980\n for that particular scenario.\n\n10:18.980 --> 10:21.900\n Instead of just training to particular tactics\n\n10:21.900 --> 10:24.900\n that have to be repeatable and trainable and lethal, right?\n\n10:24.900 --> 10:26.300\n But not necessarily the most lethal\n\n10:26.300 --> 10:28.260\n because they have to be trainable.\n\n10:28.260 --> 10:29.900\n But if we can introduce AI into that\n\n10:29.900 --> 10:32.800\n and to have a level of randomness\n\n10:32.800 --> 10:35.980\n or at least appearance of randomness due to complexity,\n\n10:35.980 --> 10:38.260\n you know, I would consider it like a stochastic\n\n10:38.260 --> 10:40.580\n tactical advantage because even our own blue fighters\n\n10:40.580 --> 10:41.960\n won't be able to engage in that fight\n\n10:41.960 --> 10:45.660\n because it would be unsafe essentially for anything else.\n\n10:45.660 --> 10:47.560\n And I think that's where we have to drive to\n\n10:47.560 --> 10:49.380\n because otherwise it's always this chicken and mouse\n\n10:49.380 --> 10:51.940\n cat game about who's tactics and who knows what.\n\n10:51.940 --> 10:54.700\n But if knowledge is no longer a factor,\n\n10:54.700 --> 10:56.480\n it's going to make things a lot different.\n\n10:56.480 --> 10:57.320\n That's really interesting.\n\n10:57.320 --> 11:02.320\n So out of the many things that are part of your expertise,\n\n11:03.140 --> 11:06.780\n your journey, you're also working on autonomous\n\n11:06.780 --> 11:08.980\n and semi autonomous systems, the use of AI\n\n11:08.980 --> 11:11.460\n and machine learning and manned on man team\n\n11:11.460 --> 11:12.300\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n11:12.300 --> 11:14.020\n We'll talk about it.\n\n11:14.020 --> 11:17.120\n But you're saying sort of when people think about\n\n11:17.120 --> 11:20.580\n the use of AI in war, in military systems,\n\n11:20.580 --> 11:23.980\n they think about like computer vision for perception\n\n11:23.980 --> 11:26.740\n or processing of sensor information\n\n11:26.740 --> 11:29.700\n in order to extract from it actionable knowledge\n\n11:29.700 --> 11:30.540\n kind of thing.\n\n11:30.540 --> 11:33.860\n But you're saying you could also use it to generate\n\n11:33.860 --> 11:37.740\n randomness that's difficult to work with\n\n11:37.740 --> 11:39.880\n in like a game theoretic way.\n\n11:39.880 --> 11:43.540\n Like it's difficult for human operators to respond to.\n\n11:43.540 --> 11:44.460\n Exactly.\n\n11:44.460 --> 11:45.460\n That's really interesting.\n\n11:45.460 --> 11:48.780\n Okay, so back to Tom Cruise and Tom Gunn.\n\n11:49.740 --> 11:51.420\n What about the dog fighting?\n\n11:51.420 --> 11:53.660\n What aspects of that were accurate?\n\n11:53.660 --> 11:58.140\n So dog fighting is kind of an interesting conversation\n\n11:58.140 --> 12:00.980\n because it's not the most tactically relevant skill set\n\n12:00.980 --> 12:03.660\n nowadays by traditional standards\n\n12:03.660 --> 12:06.060\n because the ranges with which we engage\n\n12:06.060 --> 12:09.460\n and play weapons are very significant.\n\n12:09.460 --> 12:11.940\n And so if we're in a scenario where we're in a dog fight\n\n12:11.940 --> 12:15.580\n like that, a lot of things have probably gone wrong, right?\n\n12:15.580 --> 12:17.860\n And that's kind of how this mission was set up, right?\n\n12:17.860 --> 12:21.660\n It was a no win type scenario, most likely.\n\n12:21.660 --> 12:24.020\n And so for a dog fight, the aircraft size\n\n12:24.020 --> 12:25.620\n and the ranges and the turn radiuses\n\n12:25.620 --> 12:27.980\n make it so it's not very theatrical, right?\n\n12:27.980 --> 12:29.300\n The aircraft looks small.\n\n12:29.300 --> 12:31.580\n And while it's intense with the systems I have\n\n12:31.580 --> 12:34.480\n and the sensors and what I'm feeling and all that,\n\n12:34.480 --> 12:36.440\n if I, you know, we've done it and we've done it, right?\n\n12:36.440 --> 12:38.700\n We take video of that and it's just like a blue sky\n\n12:38.700 --> 12:39.760\n and you see a little dot out there.\n\n12:39.760 --> 12:40.740\n So not very interesting.\n\n12:40.740 --> 12:42.920\n And so anytime it really looks interesting\n\n12:42.920 --> 12:46.540\n in dog fight arena, that's most likely a fiction\n\n12:46.540 --> 12:49.100\n because we really only get close for a millisecond\n\n12:49.100 --> 12:50.900\n as we're dipping past each other at the merge.\n\n12:50.900 --> 12:52.100\n You're breaking my heart, right?\n\n12:52.100 --> 12:52.940\n I know, I'm sorry.\n\n12:52.940 --> 12:54.260\n You're breaking my heart.\n\n12:54.260 --> 12:55.100\n No, I understand.\n\n12:55.100 --> 12:56.440\n In a dog fight, you can go and have fun,\n\n12:56.440 --> 12:58.340\n but you know, in a dog fight specifically.\n\n12:58.340 --> 13:00.660\n Maybe that was more common in the earlier wars,\n\n13:00.660 --> 13:02.720\n the World War II and before that,\n\n13:02.720 --> 13:06.660\n where the, is it due to the sort of the range\n\n13:06.660 --> 13:09.220\n and the effectiveness of the weapon systems involved?\n\n13:09.220 --> 13:10.060\n Correct.\n\n13:10.060 --> 13:12.700\n And the accuracy of the targeting systems at range.\n\n13:12.700 --> 13:15.280\n But there's also a train of thought\n\n13:15.280 --> 13:16.960\n that hasn't actually been tested out yet,\n\n13:16.960 --> 13:21.580\n which is with the advent of advanced electronic warfare,\n\n13:21.580 --> 13:25.060\n EW and or unmanned assets,\n\n13:25.060 --> 13:27.300\n the battle space may get so complex\n\n13:27.300 --> 13:31.380\n and missiles may essentially just get dropped out of the sky\n\n13:31.380 --> 13:34.340\n or wasted such that you're gonna be in close\n\n13:34.340 --> 13:36.460\n with either IR missiles or guns,\n\n13:36.460 --> 13:40.860\n if it's a no kidding, you know, must defend type scenario.\n\n13:40.860 --> 13:42.840\n First of all, what's electronic warfare?\n\n13:42.840 --> 13:44.460\n You know, it's basically trying to get control\n\n13:44.460 --> 13:47.540\n of electromagnetic spectrum for the interest\n\n13:47.540 --> 13:49.940\n of whatever operation is going on.\n\n13:49.940 --> 13:51.460\n So in the tactical environment,\n\n13:51.460 --> 13:53.580\n a lot of that is trying to deceive the radar\n\n13:53.580 --> 13:55.860\n or can we deceive the missiles or just, you know,\n\n13:55.860 --> 13:58.820\n stop their guide and things of that nature.\n\n13:58.820 --> 14:01.780\n Man, it's a battle in the space of information,\n\n14:01.780 --> 14:03.900\n of digital information.\n\n14:03.900 --> 14:05.860\n Yeah, well F22 and F35, right?\n\n14:05.860 --> 14:07.660\n F22 is a big expensive aircraft\n\n14:07.660 --> 14:10.060\n and it was made to be a great fighter.\n\n14:10.060 --> 14:12.300\n But the F35 is not as great of a fighter,\n\n14:12.300 --> 14:14.840\n but it's an electronic warfare\n\n14:14.840 --> 14:18.560\n and mission commander platform of the future\n\n14:18.560 --> 14:20.780\n where information is what's gonna win the war\n\n14:20.780 --> 14:22.140\n instead of the best dog fighter.\n\n14:22.140 --> 14:24.020\n And so it's interesting dichotomy there.\n\n14:24.020 --> 14:27.400\n What's the best airplane ever made, fighter jet ever made?\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:31.100\n I know the aviators in the audience are gonna hate my answer\n\n14:31.100 --> 14:33.180\n because they're gonna want that sexy, you know,\n\n14:33.180 --> 14:36.260\n muscly F14 Tomcat type fighter\n\n14:36.260 --> 14:39.060\n or maybe P51 type aircraft.\n\n14:39.060 --> 14:43.580\n But the F35 is maybe not the best dog fighter,\n\n14:43.580 --> 14:45.940\n but it doesn't have to get in a dog fight, right?\n\n14:45.940 --> 14:47.540\n It's like how you'd be the best knife fighters,\n\n14:47.540 --> 14:49.340\n not getting a knife fight sometimes.\n\n14:49.340 --> 14:53.860\n Lockheed Martin F35 Lightning II, it looks pretty sexy.\n\n14:53.860 --> 14:55.700\n There's two real strengths you can have as a fighter.\n\n14:55.700 --> 14:59.260\n You can have the ability to kind of out muscle your fighter,\n\n14:59.260 --> 15:02.500\n your opponent and beat them on Gs and power\n\n15:02.500 --> 15:03.860\n and raid around on them.\n\n15:03.860 --> 15:05.660\n And then there's the other side of that,\n\n15:05.660 --> 15:09.020\n which is you can be overly maneuverable.\n\n15:09.020 --> 15:10.860\n You can bleed energy quickly.\n\n15:10.860 --> 15:12.900\n And that's what the F18 was good at\n\n15:12.900 --> 15:15.580\n because it had to be heavier to land on aircraft carrier.\n\n15:15.580 --> 15:17.500\n We had to give it extra bulk,\n\n15:17.500 --> 15:19.300\n but it also needs a special mechanism\n\n15:19.300 --> 15:21.220\n to slow down enough to land on aircraft carrier.\n\n15:21.220 --> 15:22.820\n And so it made it very maneuverable.\n\n15:22.820 --> 15:24.420\n And what that leads to a lot of times\n\n15:24.420 --> 15:28.260\n is the ability to get maybe the first shot in a fight,\n\n15:28.260 --> 15:30.380\n which is very good, but if you do make that sharp turn,\n\n15:30.380 --> 15:31.980\n you're gonna bleed a lot of your energy away\n\n15:31.980 --> 15:33.940\n and be more susceptible for follow on shots\n\n15:33.940 --> 15:35.420\n if that one's less susceptible.\n\n15:35.420 --> 15:37.060\n And so there's just kind of aggression,\n\n15:37.060 --> 15:39.340\n nonaggression game you can play depending on\n\n15:39.340 --> 15:40.940\n the type of aircraft you're fighting.\n\n15:40.940 --> 15:43.580\n Where does the F35 land on that spectrum?\n\n15:43.580 --> 15:46.660\n The F35 lands somewhere behind the F22s.\n\n15:46.660 --> 15:49.580\n So there'll probably be a row of F22s or F18s\n\n15:49.580 --> 15:50.980\n and F35 will be out back,\n\n15:50.980 --> 15:52.620\n but it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare\n\n15:52.620 --> 15:53.460\n that's happening in front of you.\n\n15:53.460 --> 15:55.740\n Is it one of the more expensive planes\n\n15:55.740 --> 15:57.340\n because of all the stuff on it?\n\n15:57.340 --> 15:58.540\n It certainly is, yeah.\n\n16:00.140 --> 16:03.820\n In the movie, they have Tom Cruise fly it over Mach 10.\n\n16:03.820 --> 16:08.100\n So maybe can you say what are the different speeds,\n\n16:08.100 --> 16:12.380\n accelerations feel like, Mach 1, 2, 3, or hypersonic?\n\n16:12.380 --> 16:14.420\n Have you ever flown hypersonic?\n\n16:14.420 --> 16:15.260\n No.\n\n16:16.580 --> 16:18.180\n How tough does it get?\n\n16:18.180 --> 16:21.100\n I'm just gonna call out the BS of ejecting at Mach 10\n\n16:21.100 --> 16:23.460\n just for the record, because in the movie,\n\n16:23.460 --> 16:25.780\n there's been I think at least one ejection\n\n16:25.780 --> 16:29.040\n that was supersonic, and I'll just say it was not pretty,\n\n16:29.040 --> 16:30.380\n but he survived.\n\n16:30.380 --> 16:32.580\n So there would have to be some interesting mechanisms\n\n16:32.580 --> 16:34.300\n to eject successfully at Mach 10,\n\n16:34.300 --> 16:36.100\n but I'll digress on that for the moment.\n\n16:36.100 --> 16:37.460\n Yeah, that seemed very strange.\n\n16:37.460 --> 16:40.220\n And he just walked away from it, but anyway, so.\n\n16:40.220 --> 16:41.340\n He seemed disheveled.\n\n16:44.060 --> 16:46.180\n Okay, it's Tom Cruise.\n\n16:46.180 --> 16:47.820\n It's like Chuck Norris or something.\n\n16:47.820 --> 16:48.660\n Indestructible, yeah.\n\n16:48.660 --> 16:49.480\n Indestructible.\n\n16:49.480 --> 16:50.900\n He also doesn't age.\n\n16:50.900 --> 16:54.880\n But anyway, so what's interesting to say\n\n16:54.880 --> 16:58.380\n about the experience as you go up?\n\n16:58.380 --> 17:00.520\n Does it get more and more difficult?\n\n17:00.520 --> 17:02.220\n In the end of the day, crossing the sound barrier\n\n17:02.220 --> 17:04.460\n is much like crossing the speed limit on the highway.\n\n17:04.460 --> 17:06.160\n You don't really notice anything.\n\n17:07.120 --> 17:08.940\n To cross that, at least in F18,\n\n17:08.940 --> 17:11.060\n because we have a lot more weight than most fighters,\n\n17:11.060 --> 17:13.380\n typically we'll do that in a descent.\n\n17:13.380 --> 17:15.380\n We'll do that full afterburner,\n\n17:15.380 --> 17:17.020\n just dumping gas into the engine.\n\n17:18.060 --> 17:19.820\n And so that'll get us over the fastest\n\n17:19.820 --> 17:22.220\n I think I've gone with about 1.28.\n\n17:22.220 --> 17:23.580\n But what's interesting, people realize,\n\n17:23.580 --> 17:26.540\n is that if I take that throttle in an afterburner\n\n17:26.540 --> 17:29.100\n and I just bring it back, just bring it back to mil,\n\n17:29.100 --> 17:31.660\n which is full power, just not afterburner,\n\n17:31.660 --> 17:34.700\n the deacceleration is so strong due to the air friction\n\n17:34.700 --> 17:36.660\n that it'll throw you forward in your straps.\n\n17:36.660 --> 17:40.580\n Almost, I would say, maybe like 70% as strong almost\n\n17:40.580 --> 17:43.620\n as trapping on the boat, it's pretty strong.\n\n17:43.620 --> 17:44.940\n So it's almost like a reverse car crash\n\n17:44.940 --> 17:45.980\n just for the deacceleration.\n\n17:45.980 --> 17:48.420\n So the acceleration is usually kind of slow\n\n17:48.420 --> 17:49.580\n and you don't feel anything, of course,\n\n17:49.580 --> 17:50.820\n when you're crossing through it,\n\n17:50.820 --> 17:53.000\n but the deacceleration's pretty violent.\n\n17:53.900 --> 17:55.900\n The deacceleration's violent, huh, okay.\n\n17:57.020 --> 17:59.500\n But is there a fundamental difference\n\n17:59.500 --> 18:03.420\n between mach one and hypersonic, mach five and so on?\n\n18:03.420 --> 18:06.020\n Does it require super special training?\n\n18:06.020 --> 18:09.740\n And is that something that's used often in warfare\n\n18:09.740 --> 18:10.740\n or is it not really that necessary?\n\n18:10.740 --> 18:13.980\n No, so hypersonic human flight, if it exists,\n\n18:13.980 --> 18:16.280\n is not something that's employed tactically\n\n18:16.280 --> 18:19.040\n in any sense right now that I'm aware of.\n\n18:19.040 --> 18:23.300\n So I think of hypersonic technology,\n\n18:23.300 --> 18:26.020\n I think of missiles and weapons systems\n\n18:26.020 --> 18:28.900\n and delivery platform, I don't think of fighter aircraft\n\n18:28.900 --> 18:31.180\n necessarily, I can think of bomber\n\n18:31.180 --> 18:33.660\n or reconnaissance aircraft perhaps,\n\n18:33.660 --> 18:37.020\n but those would be more efficient, very long range.\n\n18:37.020 --> 18:40.340\n So I imagine acceleration would be kind of gentle, honestly.\n\n18:40.340 --> 18:42.380\n The thing you experience is the acceleration,\n\n18:42.380 --> 18:43.660\n not the actual speed.\n\n18:44.780 --> 18:46.540\n There's been just a small tangent,\n\n18:46.540 --> 18:49.480\n a lot of discussion about hypersonic nuclear weapons,\n\n18:49.480 --> 18:54.300\n like missiles from Russia bragging about that.\n\n18:54.300 --> 18:56.740\n Is this something that's a significant concern\n\n18:56.740 --> 18:57.900\n or is it just a way to flex\n\n18:57.900 --> 19:00.740\n about different kinds of weapons systems?\n\n19:00.740 --> 19:03.540\n Hypersonics, I do think pose a challenge\n\n19:03.540 --> 19:06.880\n for our detection systems because there are,\n\n19:08.260 --> 19:10.180\n you know, there are design considerations\n\n19:10.180 --> 19:12.100\n in these sensor systems as always, right?\n\n19:12.100 --> 19:14.520\n And when you build them and the technology progresses\n\n19:14.520 --> 19:16.080\n to a point where maybe it's not feasible\n\n19:16.080 --> 19:18.020\n to use that technology, you know, there's a problem.\n\n19:18.020 --> 19:22.300\n But with the all domain and kind of cross domain\n\n19:22.300 --> 19:24.220\n data linking capabilities we have,\n\n19:24.220 --> 19:29.220\n it's less of, you know, it's more of an integrated picture,\n\n19:29.340 --> 19:30.260\n I'll say.\n\n19:30.260 --> 19:34.340\n And so the hypersonics are really,\n\n19:34.340 --> 19:36.980\n what it is is how fast can we detect and destroy a problem?\n\n19:36.980 --> 19:39.080\n You're just shortening the time available to do that.\n\n19:39.080 --> 19:40.920\n We call something like that the kill chain, right?\n\n19:40.920 --> 19:45.000\n It's from locating a target and identifying it\n\n19:45.000 --> 19:48.260\n and, you know, essentially authorizing its destruction\n\n19:48.260 --> 19:50.500\n by whatever means, employing,\n\n19:50.500 --> 19:52.340\n and then actually following up to ensure\n\n19:52.340 --> 19:54.300\n that you did what you said you were going to do\n\n19:54.300 --> 19:55.140\n in some sense, right?\n\n19:55.140 --> 19:57.340\n Does it need another reattacks, something of that nature.\n\n19:57.340 --> 20:00.380\n And so there's an old dog fighting framework\n\n20:00.380 --> 20:02.020\n you could call it, it's called the OODA loop\n\n20:02.020 --> 20:04.460\n that kind of made its way in the engineering of business now\n\n20:04.460 --> 20:06.760\n but the old observe, orientate, decide act\n\n20:06.760 --> 20:10.520\n was initially a fighter mechanism in order to get inside\n\n20:10.520 --> 20:12.800\n that kill chain of your opponent and break it up\n\n20:12.800 --> 20:17.180\n so that he can't process his kill chain on you.\n\n20:17.180 --> 20:19.780\n And so hypersonics are a way of shortening those windows\n\n20:19.780 --> 20:23.260\n of opportunity to react to them.\n\n20:23.260 --> 20:25.900\n I wanted to, like, how much do you have to shorten it\n\n20:25.900 --> 20:29.260\n in order for the defense systems not to work anymore?\n\n20:29.260 --> 20:34.260\n It seems like it's very, you know, I'm both often horrified\n\n20:34.960 --> 20:38.740\n by the thought of nuclear war, but at the same time,\n\n20:38.740 --> 20:41.860\n wonder what that looks like.\n\n20:42.740 --> 20:46.080\n When I dream of extreme competence in defense systems,\n\n20:46.080 --> 20:49.060\n I imagine that not a single nuclear weapon\n\n20:49.060 --> 20:51.540\n can reach the United States by missile\n\n20:51.540 --> 20:55.300\n with the defense systems, but then again,\n\n20:55.300 --> 20:57.940\n I also understand that these are extremely\n\n20:57.940 --> 21:00.760\n complicated systems, the amount of integration required,\n\n21:00.760 --> 21:03.720\n and because you're not using them,\n\n21:03.720 --> 21:07.020\n I mean, there could be, you know,\n\n21:07.020 --> 21:10.580\n there's like an intern somewhere that like forgot\n\n21:10.580 --> 21:12.900\n to update the code, the Fortran code\n\n21:12.900 --> 21:15.180\n that like is going to make the different,\n\n21:15.180 --> 21:16.580\n because you don't have the opportunity\n\n21:16.580 --> 21:21.580\n to really thoroughly test, which is really scary.\n\n21:21.580 --> 21:24.140\n Of course, the systems are probably incredible\n\n21:24.140 --> 21:26.260\n if they could be tested, but because they can't be\n\n21:26.260 --> 21:31.260\n really thoroughly tested in an actual attack, I wonder.\n\n21:32.820 --> 21:35.820\n I guess one assumption there would be that\n\n21:35.820 --> 21:37.780\n these hypersonic missiles would only be launched\n\n21:37.780 --> 21:38.980\n in the case of an attack.\n\n21:39.860 --> 21:41.940\n It'd be interesting if there were other hypersonic objects\n\n21:41.940 --> 21:44.780\n that we could use to flex those systems.\n\n21:44.780 --> 21:46.260\n Another thing that actually happened,\n\n21:46.260 --> 21:48.220\n and I just have a million questions I want to ask you,\n\n21:48.220 --> 21:51.620\n it's fascinating to me, is there's a bird strike\n\n21:51.620 --> 21:53.700\n on the plane, does that happen often?\n\n21:53.700 --> 21:54.540\n Yeah, it's a serious issue.\n\n21:54.540 --> 21:56.820\n And it damaged the engine, and they made it seem\n\n21:56.820 --> 21:59.240\n like it's a serious, exactly a serious issue.\n\n21:59.240 --> 22:03.200\n I've hit birds, I know someone that took a turkey vulture\n\n22:03.200 --> 22:05.880\n to the face, through the cockpit, right,\n\n22:05.880 --> 22:08.580\n shattered the cockpit, knocked him out.\n\n22:08.580 --> 22:10.700\n I think that, actually, I don't know him personally,\n\n22:10.700 --> 22:12.980\n but it was a story I know from the command I was at,\n\n22:12.980 --> 22:15.560\n and I believe the backseater had to punch out\n\n22:15.560 --> 22:17.700\n and punch them both out because he was unconscious\n\n22:17.700 --> 22:20.060\n in the front seat from the bird.\n\n22:20.060 --> 22:21.300\n It can kill you from hitting you,\n\n22:21.300 --> 22:24.300\n it's like a bowling ball going 250 miles an hour.\n\n22:25.780 --> 22:30.420\n It can take out an engine very easily.\n\n22:30.420 --> 22:32.840\n Every airport I've flown at in the Navy,\n\n22:32.840 --> 22:36.060\n I've had to check the bird condition, if you will,\n\n22:36.060 --> 22:38.480\n to see how many birds, and we've had to cancel flights\n\n22:38.480 --> 22:40.780\n because there's too many of them around the airport.\n\n22:40.780 --> 22:43.180\n Some airports even have bird radars, military airports.\n\n22:43.180 --> 22:45.900\n Is there systems that monitor the bird condition?\n\n22:45.900 --> 22:48.140\n There is, yeah, there's actual radar systems,\n\n22:48.140 --> 22:51.620\n and you can go in the, certain bases you have to call up,\n\n22:51.620 --> 22:52.940\n and they'll tell you what it is for the day\n\n22:52.940 --> 22:54.580\n or for that hour, and other ones have it\n\n22:54.580 --> 22:58.820\n in their weather report that goes out over the radio.\n\n22:58.820 --> 23:00.940\n What are some technological solutions to this,\n\n23:00.940 --> 23:05.940\n or is this just, because it's a low probability event,\n\n23:06.060 --> 23:07.940\n there's no real solution for it?\n\n23:07.940 --> 23:10.340\n I would say it's not a low probability event.\n\n23:10.340 --> 23:11.900\n This is happening a lot.\n\n23:11.900 --> 23:15.020\n Although the hits themselves aren't necessarily that common,\n\n23:15.020 --> 23:18.780\n or I'll say a catastrophic hit, either a near miss or a hit\n\n23:18.780 --> 23:21.900\n or the pilot having to actively maneuver to avoid it\n\n23:21.900 --> 23:24.500\n is pretty common, and in fact, it seems stressful.\n\n23:24.500 --> 23:26.500\n It is, it's so common in fact that we know\n\n23:26.500 --> 23:28.260\n that you never want to try to go over,\n\n23:28.260 --> 23:29.740\n or you never want to go under a bird\n\n23:29.740 --> 23:31.180\n if you see it in front of you.\n\n23:31.180 --> 23:32.300\n You always want to try to go over it\n\n23:32.300 --> 23:34.180\n because what they'll do immediately if they see you\n\n23:34.180 --> 23:36.740\n is, and you startle them, is they'll bring their wings in\n\n23:36.740 --> 23:39.080\n and just drop straight down to try to get out of the path.\n\n23:39.080 --> 23:40.620\n It's interesting, I didn't know they did that,\n\n23:40.620 --> 23:43.300\n but so if you immediately, if you try to go under them,\n\n23:43.300 --> 23:44.260\n they're gonna be dropping into you,\n\n23:44.260 --> 23:45.860\n so you typically want to try to go above them.\n\n23:45.860 --> 23:48.060\n Is this something you can train for, or no?\n\n23:49.100 --> 23:50.980\n Is this one of those things you have to really experience?\n\n23:50.980 --> 23:55.140\n It's a skill set that you somewhat train for\n\n23:55.140 --> 23:57.500\n in the duties of being a fighter pilot in a sense, right?\n\n23:57.500 --> 23:59.500\n Being able to react to your environment very quickly\n\n23:59.500 --> 24:01.620\n and make decisions quickly, so.\n\n24:01.620 --> 24:04.380\n Is that one of the more absurd things,\n\n24:04.380 --> 24:06.660\n challenges you have to deal with in flying?\n\n24:06.660 --> 24:10.660\n Is there other things, sort of maybe weather conditions,\n\n24:10.660 --> 24:11.820\n like harsh weather conditions?\n\n24:11.820 --> 24:14.620\n Is there something that we maybe don't often think about\n\n24:14.620 --> 24:17.140\n in terms of the challenges of flying?\n\n24:17.140 --> 24:20.420\n Birds, in a way, aren't a ridiculous threat for us.\n\n24:20.420 --> 24:25.420\n It's a safety threat that anything physical in the air\n\n24:25.540 --> 24:27.460\n is something that we really have to be careful about,\n\n24:27.460 --> 24:29.540\n whether we're flying formation off of the aircraft\n\n24:29.540 --> 24:32.300\n right next to us or whether it's a turkey vulture\n\n24:32.300 --> 24:35.380\n at 2,000 feet or a flock of 5,000 birds,\n\n24:35.380 --> 24:37.660\n like at the runway, we have to wave off, you know?\n\n24:37.660 --> 24:39.780\n And although they're low probability,\n\n24:39.780 --> 24:41.540\n a lot of bases will have actual\n\n24:41.540 --> 24:44.220\n Environmental Protection Agency employees\n\n24:44.220 --> 24:47.780\n that are responsible for safely removing migratory birds\n\n24:47.780 --> 24:51.580\n or different animals that may be in the runways\n\n24:51.580 --> 24:53.340\n or flying about.\n\n24:53.340 --> 24:55.340\n Wow, I didn't know what a turkey vulture is,\n\n24:55.340 --> 24:57.100\n and it really does look like a mix\n\n24:57.100 --> 24:58.780\n between a vulture and a turkey.\n\n24:58.780 --> 25:00.220\n Turkey.\n\n25:00.220 --> 25:05.220\n And look kind of dumb, no offense to turkey vultures.\n\n25:06.260 --> 25:08.820\n In that movie, who was the enemy nation?\n\n25:08.820 --> 25:13.820\n Was it, I mean, I guess they were implying it's Iran.\n\n25:15.100 --> 25:17.060\n Or was it Russia?\n\n25:17.060 --> 25:18.140\n I didn't think they were implying\n\n25:18.140 --> 25:19.980\n any particular nation state, frankly.\n\n25:19.980 --> 25:22.020\n I think they did a somewhat decent job\n\n25:22.020 --> 25:26.220\n of having some ambiguous fifth generation fighters.\n\n25:26.220 --> 25:30.380\n The location and the stockpile,\n\n25:30.380 --> 25:33.260\n I get how the story kind of insinuates certain things,\n\n25:33.260 --> 25:34.300\n but they seem to do a good job\n\n25:34.300 --> 25:36.820\n of not having anything directly pointing to another nation,\n\n25:36.820 --> 25:38.940\n which I thought was the good move.\n\n25:38.940 --> 25:42.140\n I enjoy these type of movies as an aviator\n\n25:42.140 --> 25:44.340\n and as an American, right?\n\n25:44.340 --> 25:45.500\n Because it's a feel good movie,\n\n25:45.500 --> 25:48.980\n but we shouldn't be celebrating going to war\n\n25:48.980 --> 25:51.420\n with any particular country, China, Russia,\n\n25:51.420 --> 25:52.820\n whoever may have these weapons.\n\n25:52.820 --> 25:53.980\n It's fun to watch,\n\n25:53.980 --> 25:55.620\n but it would be an incredibly serious event\n\n25:55.620 --> 25:57.860\n to be implying these weapons.\n\n25:57.860 --> 26:01.060\n Yeah, and we'll talk about war in general,\n\n26:01.060 --> 26:04.740\n because yeah, the movie's kind of celebrating\n\n26:04.740 --> 26:07.060\n the human side of things\n\n26:07.060 --> 26:08.940\n and also the incredible technology involved,\n\n26:08.940 --> 26:12.460\n but there's also the cost of war\n\n26:12.460 --> 26:13.900\n and the seriousness of war\n\n26:13.900 --> 26:16.100\n and the suffering involved with war,\n\n26:16.100 --> 26:17.140\n not just in the fighting,\n\n26:17.140 --> 26:18.660\n but in the death of civilians\n\n26:18.660 --> 26:20.140\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n26:22.140 --> 26:24.180\n Well, you were a Navy pilot.\n\n26:24.180 --> 26:26.820\n Let's talk a little bit more seriously about this,\n\n26:26.820 --> 26:28.820\n and you were twice deployed in the Middle East\n\n26:28.820 --> 26:32.020\n flying the FAA 18F Super Hornet.\n\n26:32.020 --> 26:34.260\n Can you briefly tell the story of your career\n\n26:34.260 --> 26:35.420\n as a Navy pilot?\n\n26:35.420 --> 26:36.260\n Sure.\n\n26:36.260 --> 26:39.980\n So I joined the Navy in 2009, right after college.\n\n26:39.980 --> 26:42.940\n I went to, essentially, officer boot camp,\n\n26:42.940 --> 26:44.260\n officer of Canada school.\n\n26:44.260 --> 26:47.260\n I applied as a pilot, and I got in as a pilot.\n\n26:47.260 --> 26:48.900\n That was the advantage of going that way\n\n26:48.900 --> 26:50.660\n is that I could essentially choose what I wanted,\n\n26:50.660 --> 26:51.780\n and if I got in, great.\n\n26:51.780 --> 26:54.500\n If not, I didn't get stuck doing something else.\n\n26:54.500 --> 26:55.980\n So you knew you wanted to be a pilot.\n\n26:55.980 --> 26:57.340\n I did.\n\n26:57.340 --> 26:58.180\n I joined.\n\n26:58.180 --> 26:59.300\n I went through my initial training.\n\n26:59.300 --> 27:01.140\n I went through primary flight training\n\n27:01.140 --> 27:02.900\n that all aviators go through,\n\n27:02.900 --> 27:04.460\n and I did well enough that,\n\n27:06.020 --> 27:07.380\n one of the first lessons they teach you in the Navy\n\n27:07.380 --> 27:10.260\n is that you can have a great career in the Navy\n\n27:10.260 --> 27:13.020\n and you can see the world and do what you want,\n\n27:13.020 --> 27:13.860\n but at the end of the day,\n\n27:13.860 --> 27:15.580\n it's all about the needs of the Navy and what they need,\n\n27:15.580 --> 27:18.100\n so they may not have the platform you like\n\n27:18.100 --> 27:19.780\n or you may not necessarily get to choose\n\n27:19.780 --> 27:21.620\n your own adventure here,\n\n27:21.620 --> 27:24.860\n but I was lucky enough that there was one jet slot\n\n27:24.860 --> 27:26.860\n in my class, and I was lucky enough,\n\n27:26.860 --> 27:28.420\n fortunate enough to get it, so.\n\n27:28.420 --> 27:29.580\n It was a jet slot.\n\n27:29.580 --> 27:32.140\n So yeah, what that means is that I was assigned\n\n27:32.140 --> 27:33.700\n actually a tail hook at that point,\n\n27:33.700 --> 27:36.380\n which meant I would go train to fly aircraft\n\n27:36.380 --> 27:38.460\n that land on aircraft carriers,\n\n27:38.460 --> 27:40.780\n and there's essentially three aircraft\n\n27:40.780 --> 27:42.420\n that do that at the time.\n\n27:42.420 --> 27:47.420\n There's the F18 and the E2 and the C2.\n\n27:48.660 --> 27:50.940\n C2 is kind of like the mail truck for the boat.\n\n27:50.940 --> 27:54.060\n E2 is one of the big radar dish on top,\n\n27:54.060 --> 27:55.580\n and then there's all the F18s.\n\n27:55.580 --> 27:59.380\n So E2 is comms, is C2 mail truck?\n\n27:59.380 --> 28:00.620\n Yeah.\n\n28:00.620 --> 28:02.420\n C2 basically brings all the mail.\n\n28:02.420 --> 28:04.380\n They pack on the shore,\n\n28:04.380 --> 28:05.620\n and they're the ones that bring supplies\n\n28:05.620 --> 28:07.340\n to the ship via air and people.\n\n28:07.340 --> 28:08.260\n Sorry if I missed it.\n\n28:08.260 --> 28:09.900\n Is it a plane or is it a helicopter?\n\n28:09.900 --> 28:10.740\n It's a plane.\n\n28:10.740 --> 28:11.820\n Okay.\n\n28:11.820 --> 28:13.780\n All right, and the F18 is a fighter jet.\n\n28:13.780 --> 28:14.620\n Correct.\n\n28:14.620 --> 28:15.440\n Okay.\n\n28:15.440 --> 28:16.280\n So I selected tail hook,\n\n28:16.280 --> 28:18.380\n which meant I could get one of those other ones,\n\n28:18.380 --> 28:20.060\n but 80% of them or so are jets,\n\n28:20.060 --> 28:21.820\n so I was in a good spot at that point,\n\n28:21.820 --> 28:23.460\n and that's when I went to Merde, Mississippi\n\n28:23.460 --> 28:28.100\n to fly my first jet, which was the T45 Gauss Hawk.\n\n28:28.100 --> 28:30.180\n Cool, so what kind of plane is that?\n\n28:30.180 --> 28:33.160\n Is that what you were doing your training on?\n\n28:33.160 --> 28:34.800\n That's the jet aircraft you get in\n\n28:34.800 --> 28:37.520\n before you actually go to the F18.\n\n28:37.520 --> 28:39.540\n It is a carrier capable,\n\n28:39.540 --> 28:42.560\n so go to the boat for the first time in it during the day,\n\n28:42.560 --> 28:45.640\n drop fake bombs, do dog fighting,\n\n28:45.640 --> 28:49.720\n low levels, formation flying, day and night.\n\n28:49.720 --> 28:51.560\n Oh, it's a pretty plane.\n\n28:51.560 --> 28:54.520\n Yeah, and it looks like a cone so that no one hits it.\n\n28:54.520 --> 28:58.400\n Okay, so it's usually not used for fighting,\n\n28:58.400 --> 28:59.440\n it's used for training?\n\n28:59.440 --> 29:01.000\n It's used for training how to fight.\n\n29:01.000 --> 29:01.900\n Got it.\n\n29:01.900 --> 29:03.120\n So what was that like?\n\n29:03.120 --> 29:04.880\n Was that the first time you were sort of\n\n29:04.880 --> 29:06.240\n really getting into it?\n\n29:06.240 --> 29:07.320\n Yeah, that was really interesting,\n\n29:07.320 --> 29:10.360\n because before that it was a 600 horsepower prop plane.\n\n29:10.360 --> 29:13.600\n Going from that to the T45 is one of the biggest jumps\n\n29:13.600 --> 29:17.560\n in power and like Navy machine operation.\n\n29:17.560 --> 29:21.120\n How much horsepower does the T45 have approximately?\n\n29:21.120 --> 29:23.040\n Maybe like 15,000 or so.\n\n29:23.040 --> 29:26.320\n So it's a huge jump from 600 you said horsepower about?\n\n29:26.320 --> 29:28.520\n Cool, so it's a big, big leap.\n\n29:28.520 --> 29:32.360\n But it's a jet, so it performs differently, it's faster.\n\n29:32.360 --> 29:34.280\n What that means, not just because it's faster,\n\n29:34.280 --> 29:35.420\n your whole mind needs to be faster.\n\n29:35.420 --> 29:37.320\n Everything happens faster in the air now, right?\n\n29:37.320 --> 29:40.040\n Those comms happen faster,\n\n29:40.040 --> 29:41.360\n your landing gear has to come up faster,\n\n29:41.360 --> 29:42.920\n everything just happens faster in a jet.\n\n29:42.920 --> 29:44.240\n So it's a big jump.\n\n29:44.240 --> 29:47.460\n And I'll never forget going on my first flight\n\n29:47.460 --> 29:52.360\n in that aircraft, it was a formation flight for someone else.\n\n29:52.360 --> 29:54.040\n And I was just in the back watching\n\n29:54.040 --> 29:55.700\n and there was an instructor in the flight.\n\n29:55.700 --> 29:57.840\n And so what that means is the instructor\n\n29:57.840 --> 29:59.640\n is in a single aircraft and then there's three\n\n29:59.640 --> 30:01.200\n or four other aircraft and they're learning\n\n30:01.200 --> 30:04.520\n how to do joins and they're learning how to fly in formation.\n\n30:04.520 --> 30:06.640\n And as a new student in the back, it's amazing, right?\n\n30:06.640 --> 30:08.720\n Cause you know, photo op time and all this,\n\n30:08.720 --> 30:10.680\n like I'm seeing aircraft up close for the first time,\n\n30:10.680 --> 30:14.660\n it's awesome, and on the way back,\n\n30:15.720 --> 30:19.240\n we couldn't get our landing gear down, ironically.\n\n30:19.240 --> 30:22.160\n So to make a long story short,\n\n30:22.160 --> 30:24.000\n cause it's overall not that exciting,\n\n30:24.000 --> 30:25.000\n we couldn't get the gear down,\n\n30:25.000 --> 30:27.960\n we actually went to go do a control ejection\n\n30:27.960 --> 30:29.920\n to the target area where that is,\n\n30:29.920 --> 30:32.840\n about 15, 20 miles to the north of the base.\n\n30:32.840 --> 30:35.540\n Wait, did you just say that's not that exciting?\n\n30:35.540 --> 30:36.460\n Well.\n\n30:36.460 --> 30:38.720\n Cause that to me is pretty exciting.\n\n30:38.720 --> 30:41.040\n That, I mean, how, first of all,\n\n30:41.040 --> 30:43.440\n I mean, that must be terrifying,\n\n30:43.440 --> 30:45.440\n like early on in your careers,\n\n30:45.440 --> 30:49.520\n I haven't seen those things that,\n\n30:49.520 --> 30:52.120\n yeah, like how often does that kind of thing happen?\n\n30:53.040 --> 30:54.520\n Decent, more than you would think.\n\n30:54.520 --> 30:55.600\n More than you would think.\n\n30:55.600 --> 30:57.120\n There was no significant panic?\n\n30:57.120 --> 30:58.680\n This is like, this understood?\n\n30:58.680 --> 31:00.600\n This is what has to be done in this case?\n\n31:00.600 --> 31:02.440\n I think I was probably just too dumb\n\n31:02.440 --> 31:03.920\n to realize the significance of it,\n\n31:03.920 --> 31:05.440\n cause as a new student, you know,\n\n31:05.440 --> 31:07.080\n not really appreciating, you know,\n\n31:07.080 --> 31:09.200\n just what is ahead of me if we are ejecting.\n\n31:10.080 --> 31:12.100\n But at the time it was more, it was just like rote, right?\n\n31:12.100 --> 31:12.940\n Cause I was back there,\n\n31:12.940 --> 31:15.560\n and then I went from a observer mode to a,\n\n31:15.560 --> 31:17.520\n I'm gonna provide you the help that I can provide you\n\n31:17.520 --> 31:19.640\n as a member of this crew, you know, mode.\n\n31:19.640 --> 31:21.800\n And so it was less about, you know,\n\n31:21.800 --> 31:25.500\n on this 20 mile trip and thinking about my,\n\n31:25.500 --> 31:26.860\n how vulnerable I am, you know,\n\n31:26.860 --> 31:27.840\n we're going through checklists,\n\n31:27.840 --> 31:29.480\n we're talking to people, we're getting ready.\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:32.160\n So no, it wasn't fearful.\n\n31:32.160 --> 31:33.740\n And the whole time we were doing one of these\n\n31:33.740 --> 31:36.100\n to try to get the gear down.\n\n31:36.100 --> 31:38.320\n So we're unloading the jet and then loading it back\n\n31:38.320 --> 31:41.060\n to try to get the gear out with the stick.\n\n31:41.060 --> 31:46.000\n And it came down, it came down halfway there,\n\n31:46.000 --> 31:47.360\n just on its own.\n\n31:47.360 --> 31:50.320\n So it came back around and we did like a safety trap\n\n31:50.320 --> 31:52.240\n in case there was a problem with the gear.\n\n31:52.240 --> 31:55.000\n And that was my first flight, you know,\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:56.040\n a little bit of serendipity,\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:57.800\n but I'm gonna fast forward a bit.\n\n31:57.800 --> 32:00.340\n And I went back to that squad as an instructor\n\n32:00.340 --> 32:02.320\n about five or six years later,\n\n32:02.320 --> 32:04.760\n and I was an aviation safety officer at this point,\n\n32:04.760 --> 32:08.360\n which meant I was responsible for investigating mishaps.\n\n32:08.360 --> 32:13.200\n And a student went in and he went in the back seat\n\n32:13.200 --> 32:17.000\n of a form flight, just like the one I went on.\n\n32:17.000 --> 32:20.200\n And he went out and he ended up ejecting on that flight.\n\n32:20.200 --> 32:21.920\n Exact same type of flight.\n\n32:21.920 --> 32:25.040\n They went out and they had a runaway trim scenario.\n\n32:25.040 --> 32:26.320\n And it caused the aircraft essentially\n\n32:26.320 --> 32:28.640\n just inverted itself almost 180 degrees\n\n32:29.520 --> 32:31.520\n at about 600 feet over the ground.\n\n32:31.520 --> 32:33.700\n And they punched out just slightly outside\n\n32:33.700 --> 32:36.320\n the ejection window at about 300, 400 feet or so,\n\n32:36.320 --> 32:38.140\n but they were completely fine.\n\n32:39.000 --> 32:42.280\n So, you know, and then about two months later,\n\n32:42.280 --> 32:43.320\n we had another ejection.\n\n32:43.320 --> 32:45.260\n About three months after that, we had another ejection.\n\n32:45.260 --> 32:49.440\n So unfortunately, you know, it can be more common\n\n32:49.440 --> 32:50.280\n than people think.\n\n32:50.280 --> 32:52.440\n What does it feel like to get ejected?\n\n32:52.440 --> 32:53.720\n Thankfully, I don't know.\n\n32:53.720 --> 32:55.200\n I can describe it to you.\n\n32:55.200 --> 32:58.000\n I can tell you what it's like from what I've heard,\n\n32:58.000 --> 32:59.560\n but I truly think it's one of those things\n\n32:59.560 --> 33:02.480\n that you just don't understand until it happens.\n\n33:02.480 --> 33:05.280\n It's like instantaneous about 250 Gs,\n\n33:05.280 --> 33:07.800\n which is only possible because of inertia in our blood.\n\n33:07.800 --> 33:10.160\n All right, so you can actually get like 250, 300 Gs\n\n33:10.160 --> 33:11.520\n for like a few milliseconds,\n\n33:11.520 --> 33:14.200\n and then it backs off to like 40 or 50 Gs\n\n33:14.200 --> 33:16.480\n to get you away from the vehicle itself.\n\n33:16.480 --> 33:20.320\n And so, you know, you may lose consciousness.\n\n33:20.320 --> 33:24.180\n If you do, you know, who knows where you wake up.\n\n33:24.180 --> 33:25.040\n You know, you could be in a tree,\n\n33:25.040 --> 33:28.160\n you could still be falling, you could be in the water, so.\n\n33:28.160 --> 33:31.880\n The physics of that is fascinating, how to eject safely.\n\n33:31.880 --> 33:34.920\n Do you know the story about how that was tested at all?\n\n33:34.920 --> 33:35.960\n I don't know the full story,\n\n33:35.960 --> 33:36.800\n but there was an airport.\n\n33:36.800 --> 33:39.040\n I'm guessing nobody knows the full story.\n\n33:39.040 --> 33:41.480\n It's probably a lot of shady stuff going on.\n\n33:41.480 --> 33:44.400\n But anyway, you mean like in the early, early days, or?\n\n33:44.400 --> 33:46.800\n They took a flight dock up to a rocket sled\n\n33:46.800 --> 33:49.160\n and just see how much their body could take it.\n\n33:49.160 --> 33:51.520\n And he turned a lot of his body in the mush\n\n33:51.520 --> 33:53.560\n in the process of getting that science done,\n\n33:53.560 --> 33:55.740\n but he saved a lot of lives.\n\n33:55.740 --> 33:58.940\n People used to be tougher back in the day.\n\n33:58.940 --> 34:02.640\n Yeah, that's how science used to be done.\n\n34:04.200 --> 34:05.840\n So how did your training continue?\n\n34:05.840 --> 34:08.720\n So how, take me farther through your career\n\n34:10.240 --> 34:13.340\n as you worked towards graduating towards the F18s.\n\n34:13.340 --> 34:16.840\n So in VT9, where I was a student, there's two phases.\n\n34:16.840 --> 34:19.560\n There's an intermediate and an advanced.\n\n34:19.560 --> 34:22.180\n Intermediate is getting very comfortable with the aircraft.\n\n34:22.180 --> 34:23.880\n And at that point, you truly hear,\n\n34:23.880 --> 34:25.400\n all right, you're going jets now,\n\n34:25.400 --> 34:28.000\n or you're gonna go one of the other aircraft\n\n34:28.000 --> 34:30.200\n that land on the aircraft carrier.\n\n34:30.200 --> 34:33.000\n I was told I was going jets at that point.\n\n34:33.000 --> 34:35.480\n And then we go into same squadron,\n\n34:35.480 --> 34:36.880\n same aircraft, same instructors,\n\n34:36.880 --> 34:37.940\n but it's called advanced now.\n\n34:37.940 --> 34:41.280\n And now we're learning how to dog fight for the first time.\n\n34:41.280 --> 34:44.320\n We're doing what we call tactical formation,\n\n34:44.320 --> 34:46.900\n which is just like aggressive position keeping.\n\n34:48.160 --> 34:52.260\n We are doing dog fighting in low levels\n\n34:52.260 --> 34:53.320\n and all sorts of great stuff.\n\n34:53.320 --> 34:55.040\n So it's really that first introduction\n\n34:55.040 --> 34:56.280\n to that tactical environment\n\n34:56.280 --> 34:58.400\n and really putting Gs on the jet\n\n34:58.400 --> 35:00.240\n and on your body and maneuvering.\n\n35:00.240 --> 35:02.100\n Is there like tactical formation,\n\n35:02.100 --> 35:05.040\n is collaborating with other fighter jets a part of that?\n\n35:05.040 --> 35:05.880\n It is.\n\n35:05.880 --> 35:08.380\n So flying in a, that's what you mean by formation.\n\n35:08.380 --> 35:11.040\n So literally having an awareness.\n\n35:11.040 --> 35:13.560\n Is this done for you or are you as a human\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:18.220\n supposed to understand like where you are in the formation,\n\n35:18.220 --> 35:20.520\n how to maintain formation, all that kind of stuff?\n\n35:20.520 --> 35:21.360\n Yeah, there's a.\n\n35:21.360 --> 35:23.060\n Is it done autonomously or manually?\n\n35:23.060 --> 35:24.500\n There's a great autonomy point\n\n35:24.500 --> 35:25.560\n on the end of this I've thought about.\n\n35:25.560 --> 35:27.320\n So, but what we do, it's all manual.\n\n35:27.320 --> 35:29.220\n And so I'm looking at his wing\n\n35:29.220 --> 35:33.100\n and I'm looking at different visual checkpoints\n\n35:33.100 --> 35:34.640\n that form like a triangle, right?\n\n35:34.640 --> 35:36.320\n Like an equal out triangle essentially.\n\n35:36.320 --> 35:39.680\n And then as that triangle is no longer equal,\n\n35:39.680 --> 35:42.400\n I can tell my relative position against that aircraft.\n\n35:42.400 --> 35:43.400\n That's really cool.\n\n35:43.400 --> 35:45.000\n And so that's what I'm staring at first,\n\n35:45.000 --> 35:47.840\n sometimes hours on end, several feet away,\n\n35:47.840 --> 35:50.600\n doing one of these if I'm in the weather, that's all it is.\n\n35:50.600 --> 35:52.920\n So you get, it's almost like, is it peripheral vision\n\n35:52.920 --> 35:53.740\n or is it your?\n\n35:53.740 --> 35:54.840\n No, we're staring directly at it.\n\n35:54.840 --> 35:57.880\n The peripheral is going on my, on my.\n\n35:57.880 --> 35:58.720\n That's interesting.\n\n35:58.720 --> 35:59.560\n Stuff, right?\n\n35:59.560 --> 36:01.160\n My sensors and all my instruments.\n\n36:01.160 --> 36:04.240\n And so he is my gyroscope at that point, right?\n\n36:04.240 --> 36:06.640\n While you're flying, not looking straight.\n\n36:06.640 --> 36:08.600\n Correct, I'm flying like this for hours.\n\n36:08.600 --> 36:09.680\n It can hurt your neck.\n\n36:09.680 --> 36:11.280\n We don't like doing this as much.\n\n36:11.280 --> 36:13.000\n And I don't think it's just me, right?\n\n36:13.000 --> 36:14.800\n It's a weird thing where when you're like this,\n\n36:14.800 --> 36:18.460\n it's actually harder to fly formation slightly than here\n\n36:18.460 --> 36:21.680\n because being in line of your hand movements\n\n36:21.680 --> 36:24.640\n and of the aircraft somehow has an effect\n\n36:24.640 --> 36:27.000\n on our ability to be more precise and comfortable.\n\n36:27.000 --> 36:27.840\n It's strange.\n\n36:28.840 --> 36:32.400\n But so there's a symmetry to the formation usually.\n\n36:32.400 --> 36:34.440\n So one of the people on the other side\n\n36:34.440 --> 36:37.000\n really don't like being on that side.\n\n36:37.000 --> 36:40.440\n Is it, does it, who gets like the short straw?\n\n36:40.440 --> 36:43.160\n How do you decide which side of the formation you are?\n\n36:43.160 --> 36:44.000\n It's a good question too\n\n36:44.000 --> 36:46.240\n because there's kind of rank in some sense.\n\n36:46.240 --> 36:49.400\n So if it's a four person formation, right?\n\n36:49.400 --> 36:51.160\n You have the vision lead who's qualified\n\n36:51.160 --> 36:53.160\n to lead a whole division, but maybe the other ones aren't.\n\n36:53.160 --> 36:56.560\n And he has a dash two and that's his wingman essentially.\n\n36:56.560 --> 36:58.600\n And then in a division, there's two other aircraft.\n\n36:58.600 --> 37:00.600\n And then you have another senior flight leader.\n\n37:00.600 --> 37:02.320\n That's the dash three position.\n\n37:02.320 --> 37:05.080\n And then you have dash four, the last one.\n\n37:05.080 --> 37:06.860\n And if you were all lined up on one side,\n\n37:06.860 --> 37:08.860\n like fingertip, one, two, three, four,\n\n37:08.860 --> 37:10.840\n that dash four guy is gonna be at the end of that whip.\n\n37:10.840 --> 37:12.480\n So if you're flying formation,\n\n37:12.480 --> 37:15.400\n each one's making movements relative to the lead.\n\n37:15.400 --> 37:19.200\n Dash four is kind of at the end of that error.\n\n37:19.200 --> 37:21.120\n And so his movements are kind of like a whip.\n\n37:21.120 --> 37:23.320\n It's very difficult to fly in that position in close.\n\n37:23.320 --> 37:24.160\n Can you elaborate?\n\n37:24.160 --> 37:25.880\n Is it because of the error, the aerodynamics?\n\n37:25.880 --> 37:26.840\n So what's a whip?\n\n37:26.840 --> 37:28.960\n If this is a flight lead and this is dash two,\n\n37:28.960 --> 37:30.840\n flight lead is rock steady and just doing his thing.\n\n37:30.840 --> 37:32.800\n And flight two is gonna be working that triangle\n\n37:32.800 --> 37:33.640\n moving a little bit, right?\n\n37:33.640 --> 37:35.840\n And he has this small error bubble\n\n37:35.840 --> 37:37.400\n that he's doing his best to stay.\n\n37:37.400 --> 37:39.240\n And then, but dash three is flying off dash two.\n\n37:39.240 --> 37:42.880\n And so his error bubble is dash twos plus his own.\n\n37:42.880 --> 37:43.720\n And dash four.\n\n37:43.720 --> 37:44.760\n So it gets more and more stressful\n\n37:44.760 --> 37:46.840\n as you get farther out.\n\n37:46.840 --> 37:50.060\n Okay, what's the experience of that staring\n\n37:50.060 --> 37:54.840\n for long periods of time and trying to maintain formation?\n\n37:54.840 --> 37:56.320\n How stressful is that?\n\n37:56.320 --> 38:01.320\n Because we're doing that when we drive, staying in lane.\n\n38:01.680 --> 38:05.080\n And that becomes, after you get pretty good at it,\n\n38:05.080 --> 38:07.780\n it becomes somewhat, it's still stressful.\n\n38:09.160 --> 38:10.760\n Which actually is surprisingly stressful.\n\n38:10.760 --> 38:13.160\n When you look at lane keeping systems,\n\n38:13.160 --> 38:15.280\n they actually relieve that stress somehow.\n\n38:15.280 --> 38:18.520\n And it actually creates a much more pleasant experience\n\n38:18.520 --> 38:20.880\n while you're still able to maintain situational awareness\n\n38:20.880 --> 38:24.240\n and stay awake, which is really interesting.\n\n38:24.240 --> 38:26.320\n I don't think people realize how stressful it is\n\n38:26.320 --> 38:29.040\n to lane keep when they drive.\n\n38:29.040 --> 38:31.080\n So this is even more stressful.\n\n38:31.080 --> 38:34.880\n So are you, do you think about that?\n\n38:34.880 --> 38:37.380\n Or is this, yeah, I guess how stressful is it\n\n38:37.380 --> 38:39.260\n from a psychology perspective?\n\n38:39.260 --> 38:40.360\n It's very stressful.\n\n38:41.760 --> 38:43.640\n So I taught students how to do this as well.\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:46.120\n And so at our feet, we have two rudders.\n\n38:46.120 --> 38:48.920\n And if I'm flying off a flight lead over here,\n\n38:48.920 --> 38:51.120\n what you'll find a lot of times is you'll be flying,\n\n38:51.120 --> 38:53.480\n or like if I'm the instructor and the student's flying,\n\n38:53.480 --> 38:55.160\n I'll start to notice that he's having a harder\n\n38:55.160 --> 38:57.000\n and harder time keeping position.\n\n38:57.000 --> 38:59.880\n What I'll notice typically is he's locked out his leg.\n\n38:59.880 --> 39:01.800\n They'll lock out the leg that's closest\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:03.800\n to the aircraft they're flying against\n\n39:03.800 --> 39:06.080\n and push on the rudder subconsciously,\n\n39:06.080 --> 39:07.240\n because their whole body's trying to get away\n\n39:07.240 --> 39:08.760\n from the aircraft because they're so uncomfortable\n\n39:08.760 --> 39:09.960\n being close to it.\n\n39:09.960 --> 39:12.280\n And so I'll tell them, I can fix their form\n\n39:12.280 --> 39:13.180\n with just a couple of words.\n\n39:13.180 --> 39:14.920\n I'll say, wiggle your toes.\n\n39:14.920 --> 39:16.520\n And they'll wiggle their toes and they'll realize,\n\n39:16.520 --> 39:18.120\n and they'll loosen all the muscles in their legs\n\n39:18.120 --> 39:19.800\n because they realize they've been locked up\n\n39:19.800 --> 39:22.400\n and their formation flying will get a lot better.\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:25.920\n And so, there's a lot of stress associated with that.\n\n39:25.920 --> 39:30.920\n There's some interesting psychological or visual issues\n\n39:32.220 --> 39:35.280\n such as vertigo as you're flying.\n\n39:35.280 --> 39:36.820\n So if you're flying with him\n\n39:36.820 --> 39:38.740\n and then you fly right into a cloud, right?\n\n39:38.740 --> 39:39.740\n That's when it's very stressful\n\n39:39.740 --> 39:41.040\n because you have to be very close\n\n39:41.040 --> 39:42.080\n in order to maintain visual\n\n39:42.080 --> 39:44.420\n and you might be on a thunderstorm, right?\n\n39:44.420 --> 39:45.640\n And so you have to be very tight.\n\n39:45.640 --> 39:48.480\n You might start raining and then he's turning,\n\n39:48.480 --> 39:50.480\n but you might not even know that.\n\n39:50.480 --> 39:52.400\n You might not even be able to see that turn.\n\n39:52.400 --> 39:54.160\n And so all of a sudden you might look\n\n39:54.160 --> 39:56.120\n while you're in a turn thinking you were straight and level\n\n39:56.120 --> 39:58.800\n and you look just maybe back at your instruments very quick\n\n39:58.800 --> 40:01.040\n and you realize you're like in a 30 degree turn\n\n40:01.040 --> 40:03.940\n and your whole concept of where you are in the world\n\n40:03.940 --> 40:05.320\n starts getting very confused.\n\n40:05.320 --> 40:09.780\n And you immediately get this sense of, it's weird.\n\n40:09.780 --> 40:12.000\n Like I look at the HUD and it feels,\n\n40:12.000 --> 40:13.880\n all my senses are telling me it's spinning, but it's not.\n\n40:13.880 --> 40:15.800\n And so I have to trust my instruments\n\n40:15.800 --> 40:17.040\n even though it feels like it's spinning.\n\n40:17.040 --> 40:18.720\n And the same thing can happen\n\n40:18.720 --> 40:20.400\n when you're flying formation off of someone\n\n40:20.400 --> 40:25.000\n and it can be very dangerous and disorientating.\n\n40:25.000 --> 40:28.960\n But the point is to try to regain awareness\n\n40:28.960 --> 40:30.200\n by trusting the instruments,\n\n40:30.200 --> 40:33.800\n like distrust all your human senses\n\n40:33.800 --> 40:35.000\n and just use the instruments\n\n40:35.000 --> 40:37.520\n to rebuild situational awareness.\n\n40:37.520 --> 40:39.000\n Not in this particular case\n\n40:39.000 --> 40:41.600\n because our situational awareness is based,\n\n40:41.600 --> 40:43.280\n it's predicated off of our flight lead.\n\n40:43.280 --> 40:45.480\n So in a sense, I'm just trusting his movements.\n\n40:45.480 --> 40:47.480\n And so he's my gyroscope, but you're absolutely right.\n\n40:47.480 --> 40:49.720\n And if I was by myself, I would trust my instruments,\n\n40:49.720 --> 40:52.120\n but I can't just stop flying form and trust my instruments\n\n40:52.120 --> 40:52.960\n because now I'm gonna hit him.\n\n40:52.960 --> 40:54.400\n Oh yeah, you have to pay attention to him.\n\n40:54.400 --> 40:56.040\n So he's my reference.\n\n40:56.040 --> 40:58.620\n So the instruments are not helping you significantly\n\n40:58.620 --> 41:00.080\n with his positioning.\n\n41:00.080 --> 41:02.520\n Not, it's all completely manual.\n\n41:02.520 --> 41:06.120\n So is there a future where some of that is autonomous?\n\n41:06.120 --> 41:10.200\n Yeah, and I've thought about automating that flight regime.\n\n41:10.200 --> 41:11.960\n But when I started thinking about it,\n\n41:11.960 --> 41:16.400\n I realized that all the formation keeping that we do\n\n41:16.400 --> 41:20.560\n is designed to enhance the aviators\n\n41:22.120 --> 41:23.760\n ability to maintain sight, right?\n\n41:23.760 --> 41:26.320\n So we fly very tight formation so that we can go in weather\n\n41:26.320 --> 41:30.440\n and to reduce groups of traffic coming into the boat.\n\n41:30.440 --> 41:33.120\n We fly in one particular position\n\n41:33.120 --> 41:36.920\n so that all of the flight crew can look down the line\n\n41:36.920 --> 41:38.120\n and see the flight lead.\n\n41:38.120 --> 41:39.680\n So everything has based,\n\n41:39.680 --> 41:43.000\n everything has to do with the two air crew\n\n41:43.000 --> 41:45.000\n visually maintaining sight of each other\n\n41:45.000 --> 41:47.020\n and defending each other, right?\n\n41:47.020 --> 41:49.640\n In a combat spread, I might be looking,\n\n41:49.640 --> 41:52.060\n I may be three miles away from him flying formation\n\n41:52.060 --> 41:53.760\n directly beam and looking around\n\n41:53.760 --> 41:55.180\n to make sure nothing's there.\n\n41:55.180 --> 41:57.360\n So as I'm looking into automating this process,\n\n41:57.360 --> 42:01.840\n I thought, well, sure it's easy to get a bunch of aircraft\n\n42:01.840 --> 42:03.560\n to fly in formation off each other, right?\n\n42:03.560 --> 42:05.480\n It's trivial, but why?\n\n42:05.480 --> 42:06.720\n What is the best formation?\n\n42:06.720 --> 42:07.640\n Why are they doing that?\n\n42:07.640 --> 42:10.160\n And that opened up a much more interesting regime\n\n42:10.160 --> 42:12.520\n of operations and flight mechanics.\n\n42:12.520 --> 42:14.520\n And that's when we get back to that kind of stochastic\n\n42:14.520 --> 42:16.880\n mindset where we can bring in aircraft close\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:18.400\n to do some type of normal flying\n\n42:18.400 --> 42:21.140\n or reduce congestion around airports.\n\n42:21.140 --> 42:23.280\n But when we consider flying or formation\n\n42:23.280 --> 42:24.560\n in a tactical environment,\n\n42:24.560 --> 42:25.840\n we can be much more effective\n\n42:25.840 --> 42:27.860\n with nontraditional formation keeping\n\n42:27.860 --> 42:30.280\n or perhaps no formation keeping perhaps.\n\n42:30.280 --> 42:32.700\n So autonomy used for formation keeping,\n\n42:32.700 --> 42:36.520\n not for convenience, but for the introduction of randomness.\n\n42:36.520 --> 42:39.000\n Like to a real time mission planner, yeah.\n\n42:39.000 --> 42:42.480\n And then that's where you also have some human modification.\n\n42:42.480 --> 42:47.240\n So it's like unmanned teaming enters that picture.\n\n42:47.240 --> 42:51.400\n So you use some of the human intuition\n\n42:51.400 --> 42:53.840\n and adjustment of this formation.\n\n42:53.840 --> 42:56.080\n The formation itself has some uncertainty.\n\n42:56.080 --> 42:57.880\n I mean, it's such an interesting dance.\n\n42:57.880 --> 43:02.880\n I think that is the most fascinating application\n\n43:02.960 --> 43:04.080\n of artificial intelligence\n\n43:04.080 --> 43:06.960\n is when it's human AI collaboration,\n\n43:06.960 --> 43:09.280\n that semi autonomous dance\n\n43:09.280 --> 43:12.360\n that you see in these semi autonomous vehicle systems\n\n43:12.360 --> 43:14.400\n in terms of cars being driving,\n\n43:14.400 --> 43:18.040\n but also in the safety critical situation\n\n43:18.040 --> 43:20.640\n of a airplane, of a fighter jet,\n\n43:20.640 --> 43:22.960\n especially when you're flying fast.\n\n43:22.960 --> 43:25.040\n I mean, in a split second,\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:26.600\n you have to make all these kinds of decisions\n\n43:26.600 --> 43:29.760\n and it feels like an AI system can do\n\n43:29.760 --> 43:31.200\n as much harm as it can help.\n\n43:31.200 --> 43:35.600\n And so to get that right is a really fascinating challenge.\n\n43:35.600 --> 43:36.520\n One of the challenges too,\n\n43:36.520 --> 43:39.040\n isn't just the algorithms of the autonomy itself,\n\n43:39.040 --> 43:41.680\n but how it senses the environment.\n\n43:41.680 --> 43:44.300\n That of course is gonna be what all these decisions\n\n43:44.300 --> 43:45.140\n are based off of.\n\n43:45.140 --> 43:48.040\n And that's a challenge in this type of environment.\n\n43:48.040 --> 43:48.960\n Well, I gotta ask.\n\n43:48.960 --> 43:53.960\n So F18, what's it like to fly a fighter jet as best?\n\n43:53.960 --> 43:58.660\n I mean, what to you is beautiful, powerful?\n\n43:58.660 --> 44:02.080\n What do you love about the experience of flying?\n\n44:02.080 --> 44:04.720\n For me, and I think I'm an outlier a bit.\n\n44:04.720 --> 44:08.520\n It wasn't necessarily the flying itself, right?\n\n44:08.520 --> 44:12.160\n It wasn't necessarily the soaring over the clouds\n\n44:12.160 --> 44:16.200\n and looking down at the earth from upside down.\n\n44:16.200 --> 44:17.960\n I came to love that,\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:19.920\n but it wasn't necessarily the passion that drove me there.\n\n44:19.920 --> 44:21.920\n I just had no exposure to that.\n\n44:21.920 --> 44:24.820\n The only exposure I had was reading\n\n44:24.820 --> 44:28.640\n and going in the woods and science fiction and all that.\n\n44:28.640 --> 44:31.960\n And so, what seemed to kind of drive me towards that\n\n44:31.960 --> 44:35.160\n was just a desire to really be operating as close\n\n44:35.160 --> 44:38.760\n to what I thought was the edge of technology or science.\n\n44:38.760 --> 44:40.320\n And that's the path that I chose\n\n44:40.320 --> 44:41.900\n to try to get close to that.\n\n44:41.900 --> 44:44.040\n I thought that being in a fighter jet\n\n44:44.880 --> 44:49.880\n and all the tools and the technology and the knowledge\n\n44:50.160 --> 44:53.540\n and the challenges and the failures and victories\n\n44:53.540 --> 44:56.000\n that would come with that just seemed like something\n\n44:56.000 --> 44:59.120\n that I wanted to be a part of.\n\n44:59.120 --> 45:00.720\n And it wasn't necessarily about the flying,\n\n45:00.720 --> 45:01.960\n but it was about the challenge.\n\n45:01.960 --> 45:06.320\n And like I said, as a person from a small town,\n\n45:06.320 --> 45:09.200\n small high school, being able to get my hands\n\n45:09.200 --> 45:12.160\n or even just near something of such technological\n\n45:12.160 --> 45:15.520\n significance was kind of empowering for me.\n\n45:15.520 --> 45:18.360\n And that's kind of what bore the love of flight from there.\n\n45:18.360 --> 45:21.860\n Becoming, having some level of mastery in the aircraft,\n\n45:21.860 --> 45:24.040\n it really feels like an extension of your body.\n\n45:24.040 --> 45:27.480\n And once I got there, then kind of the love of flying\n\n45:27.480 --> 45:28.880\n kind of followed.\n\n45:28.880 --> 45:33.160\n So you sort of, one, is the man mastery over the machine.\n\n45:33.160 --> 45:35.520\n And second is the machine is like the greatest thing\n\n45:35.520 --> 45:38.180\n that humans have ever created arguably.\n\n45:38.180 --> 45:41.940\n The things that Lockheed Martin and others have built.\n\n45:41.940 --> 45:43.720\n I mean, the engineering in that.\n\n45:46.520 --> 45:50.040\n However you feel about war, which is one of the sad things\n\n45:50.040 --> 45:54.960\n about human civilization is war inspires\n\n45:54.960 --> 45:59.440\n the engineering of tools that are incredible.\n\n45:59.440 --> 46:02.440\n And it's like, maybe without war,\n\n46:02.440 --> 46:04.640\n if we look at human history, we would not build\n\n46:04.640 --> 46:06.660\n some of the incredible things we built.\n\n46:06.660 --> 46:09.640\n So in order to win wars, to stop wars,\n\n46:09.640 --> 46:12.320\n we build these incredible systems\n\n46:12.320 --> 46:15.000\n that perhaps propagate war.\n\n46:15.000 --> 46:17.400\n And that's another discussion I'll ask you about.\n\n46:17.400 --> 46:21.880\n But this, to you, this is like, this is a chance\n\n46:21.880 --> 46:24.960\n to experience the greatest engineering humans\n\n46:24.960 --> 46:26.600\n have ever been able to do.\n\n46:28.120 --> 46:31.120\n Like similar, I suppose, that astronauts feel like\n\n46:31.120 --> 46:31.960\n when they're flying.\n\n46:31.960 --> 46:32.960\n And I wanted to be an astronaut.\n\n46:32.960 --> 46:34.840\n I wanted to take that route.\n\n46:34.840 --> 46:37.080\n I was gonna apply to test pilot school.\n\n46:38.320 --> 46:39.800\n It just didn't work out for me.\n\n46:39.800 --> 46:42.360\n I ended up having a broken foot during my window.\n\n46:42.360 --> 46:45.720\n But long story short, I ended up after my time\n\n46:45.720 --> 46:47.640\n in my fleet squadron, and we can get back to the rest\n\n46:47.640 --> 46:48.480\n of the timeline if you want,\n\n46:48.480 --> 46:53.480\n but I went to be an instructor pilot instead, right?\n\n46:54.120 --> 46:56.720\n And then, I was talking about this\n\n46:56.720 --> 46:59.840\n with a squadron mate earlier today about how,\n\n46:59.840 --> 47:01.900\n I certainly wouldn't be talking with Lex today\n\n47:01.900 --> 47:04.000\n if I ended up going to test pilot school.\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.620\n I never would have, I never would have had the,\n\n47:09.900 --> 47:12.160\n I wouldn't, maybe recklessness, I don't know,\n\n47:12.160 --> 47:14.280\n but the willingness to have a conversation\n\n47:14.280 --> 47:19.080\n about UAP while I was, that led me to the decision\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:20.680\n to get out once I went there.\n\n47:20.680 --> 47:25.680\n And it kind of enabled me to talk about UAP more publicly.\n\n47:26.560 --> 47:28.800\n And if I stayed in the Navy, then I don't think\n\n47:28.800 --> 47:29.640\n that would have happened.\n\n47:29.640 --> 47:33.240\n I wouldn't have been able to if I went that route.\n\n47:33.240 --> 47:36.300\n Well, as a small tangent, do you hope to travel\n\n47:36.300 --> 47:37.200\n to Mars one day?\n\n47:37.200 --> 47:39.560\n Do you think you'll step foot on Mars one day?\n\n47:40.520 --> 47:42.040\n If you asked me that five years ago,\n\n47:42.040 --> 47:44.640\n I would have said, yes, I want to.\n\n47:44.640 --> 47:46.440\n In fact, I would like to die on Mars.\n\n47:48.400 --> 47:51.000\n Now, today, now I have some hesitations\n\n47:51.000 --> 47:52.160\n and I have some hesitations\n\n47:52.160 --> 47:54.880\n because I'm hopeful and optimistic.\n\n47:54.880 --> 47:57.940\n And I think that, you know, I think that we are truly\n\n47:57.940 --> 48:02.000\n like on the brink of a very wide technological revolution\n\n48:02.000 --> 48:04.720\n that's going to kind of move us how we used to move\n\n48:04.720 --> 48:09.260\n information and data in this last century.\n\n48:09.260 --> 48:11.320\n We're going to be manipulating and managing matter\n\n48:11.320 --> 48:12.160\n in that next century.\n\n48:12.160 --> 48:15.700\n And so I think that, I think our reach as humans\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:17.520\n are going to get a lot wider, a lot faster\n\n48:17.520 --> 48:19.880\n than people may realize, or at least.\n\n48:19.880 --> 48:22.680\n Wait, are you getting like super ambitious beyond Mars?\n\n48:22.680 --> 48:23.620\n Is that what you're saying?\n\n48:23.620 --> 48:24.840\n Well, I mean.\n\n48:24.840 --> 48:27.480\n Like Mars seems kind of boring, I want to go beyond that.\n\n48:27.480 --> 48:31.480\n Is that what, do you mean the reach of humanity\n\n48:31.480 --> 48:32.860\n across all kinds of technologies?\n\n48:32.860 --> 48:34.480\n Or do you mean literally across space?\n\n48:34.480 --> 48:35.760\n Across space, you know?\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:37.960\n So, you know, we're going to be, I think that\n\n48:37.960 --> 48:40.240\n as artificial intelligence and machine learning\n\n48:40.240 --> 48:42.840\n start broaching further into the topic of science,\n\n48:42.840 --> 48:44.760\n the area of science, and we start working through\n\n48:44.760 --> 48:47.240\n new physics, we start working through,\n\n48:47.240 --> 48:50.320\n or I should say pass the Einsteinian frameworks\n\n48:50.320 --> 48:53.100\n as we kind of get a better idea of what space time is\n\n48:53.100 --> 48:56.940\n or isn't, we may have, we may find, you know,\n\n48:56.940 --> 48:58.880\n answers that we didn't know that we were looking for.\n\n48:58.880 --> 49:00.600\n And we may have more opportunity.\n\n49:00.600 --> 49:03.020\n And I'm not saying this is something I'm, you know,\n\n49:03.020 --> 49:06.680\n betting the farm on, of course, but maybe that's a road\n\n49:06.680 --> 49:09.640\n I want to explore on Earth instead of on Mars.\n\n49:09.640 --> 49:12.440\n Maybe there's technology that can be brought to bear\n\n49:12.440 --> 49:15.400\n with new science and harder engineering that is a road\n\n49:15.400 --> 49:18.300\n that doesn't go past Mars to get outside the solar system.\n\n49:19.360 --> 49:22.360\n So there are different ways to explore the universe\n\n49:22.360 --> 49:24.700\n than the traditional rocket systems.\n\n49:26.320 --> 49:29.720\n If we can continue sort of your journey,\n\n49:31.140 --> 49:35.440\n you said that you were attracted to the incredibly\n\n49:35.440 --> 49:39.520\n advanced technologies of the F18s and just the\n\n49:39.520 --> 49:40.720\n fighter jets in general.\n\n49:42.680 --> 49:45.880\n Let me ask another question, which seems incredibly\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:50.080\n difficult to do, which is landing on a carrier\n\n49:50.080 --> 49:52.240\n or taking off from a carrier and landing on a carrier.\n\n49:52.240 --> 49:54.520\n So what's that like?\n\n49:54.520 --> 49:56.360\n What are the challenges of that?\n\n49:56.360 --> 49:57.920\n Taking off's pretty easy.\n\n49:57.920 --> 50:01.040\n It's procedurally somewhat complex where there's a lot\n\n50:01.040 --> 50:03.240\n of moving parts, almost like a clock, you know.\n\n50:03.240 --> 50:04.620\n You're almost in a pocket watch.\n\n50:04.620 --> 50:06.920\n So then you're a part of the machinery.\n\n50:06.920 --> 50:08.640\n And so long as you press the right buttons\n\n50:08.640 --> 50:10.160\n and do the right things, you're gonna go shooting\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:11.040\n off the front.\n\n50:11.040 --> 50:12.600\n So there's like a checklist to follow and there's\n\n50:12.600 --> 50:14.400\n several people involved in that checklist\n\n50:14.400 --> 50:16.480\n and you just gotta follow the checklist correctly.\n\n50:16.480 --> 50:17.640\n Essentially, yep.\n\n50:17.640 --> 50:19.460\n Lots of ways to screw it up, but you'll know\n\n50:19.460 --> 50:20.880\n how to screw it up.\n\n50:20.880 --> 50:23.320\n But landing on the back of the boat is a whole\n\n50:23.320 --> 50:24.920\n different animal.\n\n50:24.920 --> 50:26.800\n There's a lot more variables.\n\n50:26.800 --> 50:29.320\n There's essentially one or two people responsible\n\n50:29.320 --> 50:31.640\n for the success of that.\n\n50:31.640 --> 50:34.880\n The landing signal officer who actually represents\n\n50:34.880 --> 50:38.420\n a team of specially trained aviators who are responsible\n\n50:38.420 --> 50:40.680\n for helping that aviator land on the boat.\n\n50:41.760 --> 50:44.240\n And the pilot himself.\n\n50:44.240 --> 50:49.240\n And it is a hard task to actually fly precisely enough\n\n50:49.400 --> 50:50.320\n to be good at it.\n\n50:50.320 --> 50:53.640\n So to fly quote unquote the perfect pass,\n\n50:53.640 --> 50:55.520\n you essentially have to fly your head through a one foot\n\n50:55.520 --> 50:57.040\n by one foot box.\n\n50:57.040 --> 51:00.040\n That's essentially the target you're shooting for.\n\n51:00.040 --> 51:02.640\n Plus or minus probably about five knots on airspeed,\n\n51:02.640 --> 51:04.600\n although we don't really judge it by airspeed.\n\n51:04.600 --> 51:06.480\n It's something called angle of attack.\n\n51:06.480 --> 51:09.480\n But generally pretty tight parameters there.\n\n51:09.480 --> 51:11.920\n And you can do everything perfect and still fail.\n\n51:11.920 --> 51:13.800\n So when we go to touchdown, we immediately bring\n\n51:13.800 --> 51:17.920\n the power up and we rotate as if we were doing,\n\n51:17.920 --> 51:19.840\n as if we were bouncing off the deck.\n\n51:19.840 --> 51:23.240\n And if we catch it, then we slow down.\n\n51:23.240 --> 51:25.120\n And then someone tells us to bring the power back,\n\n51:25.120 --> 51:27.420\n which we do, we don't do it on our own.\n\n51:27.420 --> 51:29.320\n Cause it's such a violent experience.\n\n51:30.600 --> 51:32.640\n Think you're trapped or not, or something breaks\n\n51:32.640 --> 51:34.240\n and you bring your throttle back.\n\n51:34.240 --> 51:35.680\n And that's a very serious thing.\n\n51:35.680 --> 51:38.360\n It happened to best of us, I'll admit I've done it once.\n\n51:38.360 --> 51:40.760\n When I first got to the squadron,\n\n51:40.760 --> 51:42.680\n it's called ease guns land.\n\n51:42.680 --> 51:45.640\n And so I came in the boat and I brought the power.\n\n51:45.640 --> 51:47.040\n I cracked the power back a little bit\n\n51:47.040 --> 51:49.820\n before I've been told to her that my aircraft\n\n51:49.820 --> 51:51.480\n had finished settling in.\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:52.840\n And that was a big faux pas, right?\n\n51:52.840 --> 51:53.920\n So, especially as a new guy.\n\n51:53.920 --> 51:57.480\n So it's a very serious business.\n\n51:57.480 --> 51:58.440\n There's a lot of eyes on you\n\n51:58.440 --> 52:00.100\n and there's a lot of ways to screw it up.\n\n52:00.100 --> 52:03.380\n But the physical rush of like having a great pass\n\n52:03.380 --> 52:07.320\n and then like the crash of into the boat and all that,\n\n52:07.320 --> 52:09.120\n the physical sensation from it,\n\n52:09.120 --> 52:10.680\n when everything's going great,\n\n52:10.680 --> 52:12.620\n it's top of the world, it's a great feeling.\n\n52:12.620 --> 52:13.560\n How much of it is feel?\n\n52:13.560 --> 52:16.640\n How much of it is instruments?\n\n52:16.640 --> 52:18.640\n How much is other people just doing the work for you,\n\n52:18.640 --> 52:20.720\n catching you, as long as you do everything right?\n\n52:20.720 --> 52:21.860\n There's a few systems we use.\n\n52:21.860 --> 52:23.200\n One is called the BAL.\n\n52:23.200 --> 52:26.060\n And the BAL is external to our aircraft.\n\n52:26.060 --> 52:29.120\n And it's B A L L, BAL, like BAL, okay.\n\n52:29.120 --> 52:31.480\n It's a iFloss landing system,\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:33.440\n which stands for something very long convoluted.\n\n52:33.440 --> 52:35.560\n But essentially it's a mirror with lights on it.\n\n52:35.560 --> 52:40.560\n And you see the light at a different cell\n\n52:40.560 --> 52:44.580\n based on your position relative to an ideal glide slope.\n\n52:44.580 --> 52:46.240\n So if you're right on it, you're right in the middle.\n\n52:46.240 --> 52:48.080\n And if you're below, you're low.\n\n52:48.080 --> 52:51.240\n And as I add power and maneuver the aircraft,\n\n52:51.240 --> 52:55.160\n that BAL, I see that BAL rise, I see that BAL low.\n\n52:55.160 --> 52:57.100\n It's a lagging indicator though, right?\n\n52:57.100 --> 53:00.200\n And your jet is a lagging engine too, right?\n\n53:00.200 --> 53:01.400\n It takes time to spool up the engine.\n\n53:01.400 --> 53:03.120\n So that adds to the complexity.\n\n53:03.120 --> 53:04.620\n You have to think ahead a bit.\n\n53:05.880 --> 53:07.040\n So you don't want to,\n\n53:07.920 --> 53:10.480\n you can't just bring the power up and leave it there.\n\n53:10.480 --> 53:13.040\n You have to bring the power up, touch it, bring it back.\n\n53:13.040 --> 53:15.360\n And oh, by the way, your landing area is moving,\n\n53:15.360 --> 53:17.920\n not just away from you, but also on an angle, right?\n\n53:17.920 --> 53:19.000\n Cause we have an angled deck.\n\n53:19.000 --> 53:21.500\n And so you're constantly doing one of these\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:23.440\n to correct yourself as you go.\n\n53:23.440 --> 53:24.400\n That seems so stressful.\n\n53:24.400 --> 53:26.320\n And every time you do one of those,\n\n53:26.320 --> 53:28.480\n maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank, right?\n\n53:28.480 --> 53:30.240\n I'm losing lift, right?\n\n53:30.240 --> 53:33.020\n And so I have to compensate with power each time I do that.\n\n53:33.020 --> 53:33.860\n So I'm doing another one.\n\n53:33.860 --> 53:36.960\n Cause you have to maintain the same level\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:38.360\n you're always lowering.\n\n53:38.360 --> 53:39.520\n It's a constant rate of descent\n\n53:39.520 --> 53:41.920\n that's increasing from about 200 feet per minute\n\n53:41.920 --> 53:43.120\n to about 650.\n\n53:43.120 --> 53:45.760\n And every time you do this, that's messing with that.\n\n53:45.760 --> 53:46.600\n Okay.\n\n53:46.600 --> 53:47.440\n So you have to compensate.\n\n53:47.440 --> 53:48.600\n And you're doing that manually.\n\n53:48.600 --> 53:49.440\n Do that manually.\n\n53:49.440 --> 53:50.260\n All right.\n\n53:50.260 --> 53:52.960\n And then of course, as you come down that glide slope,\n\n53:52.960 --> 53:54.320\n it becomes more and more narrow.\n\n53:54.320 --> 53:55.840\n And you have to, of course,\n\n53:55.840 --> 53:58.840\n modulate your inputs such that they're smaller and smaller\n\n53:58.840 --> 54:00.000\n cause they have a bigger and bigger effect\n\n54:00.000 --> 54:01.040\n as you get closer in.\n\n54:02.400 --> 54:04.920\n And what happens too, when you get in close is that\n\n54:04.920 --> 54:06.200\n right before you cross over,\n\n54:06.200 --> 54:08.240\n if this is the boat right here, your table,\n\n54:08.240 --> 54:10.040\n right before you kind of get your wings\n\n54:10.040 --> 54:11.760\n over the boat itself,\n\n54:11.760 --> 54:15.520\n this big wind from the main tower of the boat\n\n54:15.520 --> 54:16.400\n is where it dips down.\n\n54:16.400 --> 54:18.560\n So the wind actually goes down and it's called the burble.\n\n54:18.560 --> 54:19.800\n And it'll actually pull the aircraft down,\n\n54:19.800 --> 54:21.360\n increase your rate of descent.\n\n54:21.360 --> 54:22.360\n So at that particular point,\n\n54:22.360 --> 54:24.600\n you need to increase your speed.\n\n54:24.600 --> 54:26.360\n You know, increase your power\n\n54:26.360 --> 54:27.640\n and try to compensate against that.\n\n54:27.640 --> 54:28.960\n And so that's kind of a third variable\n\n54:28.960 --> 54:31.920\n that's trying to screw you up on your way down.\n\n54:31.920 --> 54:34.080\n What's the most difficult conditions\n\n54:34.080 --> 54:34.920\n in which you had to land\n\n54:34.920 --> 54:36.720\n or you've seen somebody had to land?\n\n54:36.720 --> 54:40.720\n Because I think you were also a signal officer as well.\n\n54:40.720 --> 54:41.540\n I was, yeah.\n\n54:41.540 --> 54:44.120\n I was the head landing signal officer for my squadron.\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:46.960\n So you've probably seen some tough landings.\n\n54:46.960 --> 54:47.800\n I have.\n\n54:47.800 --> 54:49.720\n I've seen a ramp strike,\n\n54:49.720 --> 54:52.480\n which is when a part of the aircraft hits\n\n54:52.480 --> 54:54.880\n before the landing area,\n\n54:54.880 --> 54:57.440\n which is basically the round out of the boat.\n\n54:57.440 --> 54:58.560\n That is before the landing area.\n\n54:58.560 --> 55:01.400\n So they basically struck the back of the boat coming in.\n\n55:01.400 --> 55:02.400\n It was just their hook.\n\n55:02.400 --> 55:03.700\n So it wasn't their craft.\n\n55:04.800 --> 55:05.640\n And they were fine.\n\n55:05.640 --> 55:07.200\n That one was kind of ugly.\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:09.520\n But it like rips that part of the aircraft.\n\n55:09.520 --> 55:10.360\n Absolutely.\n\n55:10.360 --> 55:12.440\n And then you land on your bellies, that kind of thing.\n\n55:12.440 --> 55:13.680\n In this particular case,\n\n55:13.680 --> 55:15.600\n it hit and then it gave\n\n55:15.600 --> 55:18.760\n and essentially dragged the hook on the surface after that.\n\n55:18.760 --> 55:21.040\n And so he was able to grab a wire at that point.\n\n55:21.040 --> 55:22.200\n When does that kind of thing happen?\n\n55:22.200 --> 55:24.000\n Is it just a miscalculation by the pilot\n\n55:24.000 --> 55:27.040\n or is it weather conditions?\n\n55:27.040 --> 55:28.780\n I wouldn't even call it a miscalculation.\n\n55:28.780 --> 55:30.400\n I mean, I'm going to put the blame on the pilot\n\n55:30.400 --> 55:31.640\n because he's the only one in the cockpit.\n\n55:31.640 --> 55:34.240\n But then the day he's reacting to the situations\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:35.080\n he's dealing with.\n\n55:35.080 --> 55:37.720\n And so it may be errors or he may be doing the best\n\n55:37.720 --> 55:40.480\n with the conditions that he's been given.\n\n55:40.480 --> 55:42.100\n On that particular one,\n\n55:42.100 --> 55:43.480\n you just got too high rate of send.\n\n55:43.480 --> 55:44.320\n It's very common.\n\n55:44.320 --> 55:45.560\n And that's what you see it with new pilots.\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:47.280\n You see it with older pilots, right?\n\n55:47.280 --> 55:49.320\n New ones and complacent ones.\n\n55:49.320 --> 55:52.480\n What you see is they'll try to make the ball go\n\n55:52.480 --> 55:54.000\n right where they want it in close.\n\n55:54.000 --> 55:56.120\n They think they can beat the game a little bit.\n\n55:56.120 --> 55:58.360\n And they try to, and so we have sayings,\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:01.480\n we teach pilots as a landing signal officer,\n\n56:01.480 --> 56:04.040\n we tell them like, don't recenter the high ball in close.\n\n56:04.040 --> 56:05.800\n It's one of the rules to live by.\n\n56:05.800 --> 56:07.440\n And so when the ball's up high,\n\n56:07.440 --> 56:09.260\n don't try to bring it back in close\n\n56:09.260 --> 56:11.820\n to like the center point when you're in close.\n\n56:11.820 --> 56:12.920\n Cause what you're doing is you bring the power off\n\n56:12.920 --> 56:14.440\n and you're going to crash right down.\n\n56:14.440 --> 56:15.680\n And that's what happens, right?\n\n56:15.680 --> 56:18.000\n Cause you got the burble pulling you down.\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:21.160\n You might be correcting, which is decreasing your lift.\n\n56:21.160 --> 56:23.520\n And then you have that type of maneuvers.\n\n56:23.520 --> 56:25.000\n How are you supposed to do all of this\n\n56:25.000 --> 56:27.000\n in harsh weather conditions?\n\n56:27.000 --> 56:28.480\n And so that's the one I wanted to tell you about.\n\n56:28.480 --> 56:29.440\n That's the hardest one.\n\n56:29.440 --> 56:33.380\n And what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi lights on,\n\n56:33.380 --> 56:34.880\n that's a really shitty day.\n\n56:34.880 --> 56:37.920\n 99 taxi lights on, what's that mean?\n\n56:37.920 --> 56:39.880\n Everyone put your taxi lights on\n\n56:39.880 --> 56:43.160\n because you're about to land on the boat.\n\n56:43.160 --> 56:44.040\n And you don't see the boat?\n\n56:44.040 --> 56:46.640\n Weather is so bad that the landing signal officer\n\n56:46.640 --> 56:48.680\n on the boat can't see you either.\n\n56:48.680 --> 56:49.640\n And you can't see the boat.\n\n56:49.640 --> 56:52.520\n And you won't be able to see it when you touch down.\n\n56:52.520 --> 56:55.080\n So we call that a zero, zero landing.\n\n56:55.080 --> 56:57.920\n And you turn on the taxi lights so that the LSO\n\n56:57.920 --> 57:00.240\n who has a radio in his hand that looks like a phone\n\n57:00.240 --> 57:04.720\n from 1980 is talking directly to the pilot.\n\n57:04.720 --> 57:06.960\n And he's looking at that little light in the rain\n\n57:06.960 --> 57:09.240\n and he's telling them you're high, you're low,\n\n57:09.240 --> 57:11.360\n power, things like that.\n\n57:11.360 --> 57:13.240\n Come right, back to left.\n\n57:13.240 --> 57:15.160\n And literally talking him down to land\n\n57:15.160 --> 57:16.000\n on the boat right there.\n\n57:16.000 --> 57:18.020\n And the pilot, usually it comes as a surprise\n\n57:18.020 --> 57:18.860\n to the pilot, the landing,\n\n57:18.860 --> 57:20.080\n because he's just listening to the voice,\n\n57:20.080 --> 57:21.800\n can't see the ball, can't see the boat.\n\n57:21.800 --> 57:23.400\n And all of a sudden you just hit the boat.\n\n57:23.400 --> 57:24.840\n You crash, I mean you crash.\n\n57:24.840 --> 57:27.920\n We're going about 1,600 feet per minute descent\n\n57:27.920 --> 57:28.760\n at that point.\n\n57:28.760 --> 57:30.960\n So you're going super fast.\n\n57:30.960 --> 57:32.560\n So all of this is happening fast.\n\n57:32.560 --> 57:37.560\n You don't know the moment it's gonna hit.\n\n57:37.640 --> 57:40.040\n So you're just going into the darkness\n\n57:40.040 --> 57:41.880\n and just waiting for it to hit.\n\n57:41.880 --> 57:43.860\n Maybe not dark though, a lot of times it's white.\n\n57:43.860 --> 57:44.700\n Into the light.\n\n57:44.700 --> 57:46.680\n You're just going into the light.\n\n57:46.680 --> 57:50.100\n And then there's a voice from an 80s phone.\n\n57:50.100 --> 57:50.940\n I got it.\n\n57:50.940 --> 57:52.080\n This is terrible.\n\n57:53.920 --> 57:57.600\n But so you still have to,\n\n57:57.600 --> 57:59.040\n so this kind of thing happens.\n\n57:59.040 --> 58:00.320\n You still have to land.\n\n58:00.320 --> 58:02.560\n Sometimes you just don't have a place to divert.\n\n58:02.560 --> 58:04.220\n But in a sense we're trained for that\n\n58:04.220 --> 58:06.240\n because we do the night landings as well.\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:07.880\n And I think you'll find this interesting,\n\n58:07.880 --> 58:10.260\n but I always found that the night landings\n\n58:10.260 --> 58:12.640\n where in these particular cases,\n\n58:12.640 --> 58:14.800\n you're usually lined up behind the boat,\n\n58:14.800 --> 58:17.040\n maybe 10, 15 miles, whereas the other ones,\n\n58:17.040 --> 58:18.960\n it's like a tight circle, the landing pattern.\n\n58:18.960 --> 58:21.600\n And so we can potentially see the boat way out there\n\n58:23.460 --> 58:25.160\n if the lights were on, which they're not.\n\n58:25.160 --> 58:26.960\n But we can maybe see like the string of aircraft\n\n58:26.960 --> 58:28.100\n in front of us.\n\n58:28.100 --> 58:31.160\n But what's interesting is that it can take a while.\n\n58:31.160 --> 58:32.360\n You might be 15 miles out\n\n58:32.360 --> 58:36.040\n and your lights are turned down as dim as possible.\n\n58:36.040 --> 58:38.800\n You have a cloud deck maybe at six or 7,000 feet\n\n58:38.800 --> 58:40.960\n so that the starlight, there's no moon,\n\n58:40.960 --> 58:42.600\n but let's say the starlight's blocked out\n\n58:42.600 --> 58:45.240\n because just the starlight alone, no moon,\n\n58:45.240 --> 58:47.120\n you can see the boat, you can see the water.\n\n58:47.120 --> 58:50.520\n But when that goes away, it's like closing your eyes.\n\n58:50.520 --> 58:52.040\n You can't tell anything.\n\n58:52.040 --> 58:53.720\n It could be upside down.\n\n58:53.720 --> 58:55.600\n It could be in any position.\n\n58:55.600 --> 58:58.480\n And for me, it was almost a meditative process\n\n58:58.480 --> 59:00.560\n that I had to snap myself back out of\n\n59:00.560 --> 59:02.880\n when I was on like a long straightaway.\n\n59:02.880 --> 59:05.080\n And then I would see the light pop up\n\n59:05.080 --> 59:06.620\n in the sea of darkness.\n\n59:06.620 --> 59:07.600\n No lights anywhere.\n\n59:07.600 --> 59:09.120\n Can't even see the horizon.\n\n59:09.120 --> 59:10.760\n And I just see a light out there.\n\n59:10.760 --> 59:12.920\n My instruments were telling me, and they're turned down\n\n59:12.920 --> 59:13.760\n as far as they can go, right?\n\n59:13.760 --> 59:14.580\n So I can barely see them.\n\n59:14.580 --> 59:16.120\n So my eyes can adjust.\n\n59:16.120 --> 59:18.560\n And I'm just staring at this light in the distance.\n\n59:18.560 --> 59:21.620\n And it's just very meditative and it's the hum behind you.\n\n59:21.620 --> 59:25.180\n And then at like four miles, you know,\n\n59:25.180 --> 59:26.780\n almost like, oh, the light is a little bit bigger.\n\n59:26.780 --> 59:28.280\n And you almost kind of have to snap back to it\n\n59:28.280 --> 59:30.160\n and be like, oh, I need to like kind of like\n\n59:30.160 --> 59:32.240\n look around a little bit and engage my brain,\n\n59:32.240 --> 59:35.120\n link it back to my body and like do this thing.\n\n59:35.120 --> 59:36.760\n Because you're going to have to actually land.\n\n59:36.760 --> 59:40.520\n Well, is there just, you said you don't necessarily feel\n\n59:40.520 --> 59:42.120\n the romantic notion of the whole thing,\n\n59:42.120 --> 59:45.800\n but is there some aspects of flying where you look up\n\n59:45.800 --> 59:50.800\n and maybe you see the stars or yeah, that kind of thing\n\n59:51.280 --> 59:53.080\n that you just like, holy crap,\n\n59:53.080 --> 59:55.400\n how did humans accomplish all of this?\n\n59:55.400 --> 59:58.320\n Like, am I actually flying right now?\n\n59:58.320 --> 1:00:00.480\n I used to have those moments on the boat\n\n1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:01.920\n when I was catching planes land.\n\n1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:05.100\n I would, they would trap and it'd be nighttime.\n\n1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:07.160\n And it's just all this chaos in the middle of the ocean\n\n1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:07.980\n and nothing.\n\n1:00:07.980 --> 1:00:09.320\n And I would have these moments where I'd be like,\n\n1:00:09.320 --> 1:00:11.200\n how the hell did I end up here?\n\n1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:13.760\n You know, there's one moment in time next to an aircraft\n\n1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:16.400\n landing on a boat in the middle of the ocean, you know,\n\n1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:17.880\n where did my life, you know,\n\n1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.120\n how did my life go to end up here?\n\n1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:20.520\n How interesting.\n\n1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:24.240\n But what I did start to enjoy was the night vision goggles\n\n1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:26.800\n and putting those on and looking up at the stars\n\n1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:29.800\n flying around, especially over the ocean.\n\n1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:30.640\n What do they look like?\n\n1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:33.320\n And there's just so many, there's just so many stars\n\n1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:34.920\n that, you know, you normally can't see.\n\n1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:36.600\n They're shooting stars all the time.\n\n1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:39.360\n Almost every flight you'd see them with the goggles on.\n\n1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:42.120\n And so it was a great pleasure to take advantage\n\n1:00:42.120 --> 1:00:44.520\n of the lack of light pollution in some cases,\n\n1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.440\n especially on deployment to go grab some goggles at night,\n\n1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:51.000\n go out some quiet spot in the ship that no one can see me\n\n1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.900\n and just kind of look around, you know.\n\n1:00:52.900 --> 1:00:53.940\n Yeah, it's humbling.\n\n1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.200\n Quick break, bathroom break?\n\n1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:59.840\n Yeah, wouldn't mind a quick stretch of legs.\n\n1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:00.960\n You got a few cool patches.\n\n1:01:00.960 --> 1:01:05.880\n I do, so this is a VFA 11 Red Rippers patch.\n\n1:01:05.880 --> 1:01:08.240\n Typically going actually on our arm.\n\n1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:12.760\n So this is actually what we call the Boar's Head or Arnold.\n\n1:01:12.760 --> 1:01:15.640\n So this is actually the Boar's Head\n\n1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.080\n from the Gordon's Gin bottle.\n\n1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:22.120\n In 1918, we were in London or the UK somewhere\n\n1:01:22.120 --> 1:01:25.700\n and we apparently partied with the owner and founder\n\n1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:27.920\n of Gordon's Gin and we had a great time\n\n1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:29.840\n and there's a signed letter in our ready room\n\n1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:32.160\n that says we can use the logo in perpetuity.\n\n1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:33.000\n Oh, nice.\n\n1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.400\n And yeah, so I'd like to give you that patch.\n\n1:01:36.400 --> 1:01:39.540\n I drank quite a bit of gourd, so this is good.\n\n1:01:39.540 --> 1:01:43.760\n And I'd like to give you that coin from our squadron.\n\n1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:46.880\n The Red Rippers, that's a badass name.\n\n1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:49.560\n Thank you, brother.\n\n1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:50.380\n You're welcome.\n\n1:01:50.380 --> 1:01:51.640\n So let's jump around a little bit,\n\n1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:56.600\n but let me ask you about this one set of experiences\n\n1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:59.040\n that you had and people in your squadron had.\n\n1:01:59.040 --> 1:02:00.720\n So you and a few people in the squadron\n\n1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:03.360\n either detected UFOs on your instruments\n\n1:02:03.360 --> 1:02:05.120\n or saw them directly.\n\n1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:07.960\n Tell me the full story of these UFO sightings\n\n1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.720\n and to the smallest technical details,\n\n1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:12.460\n because I love those.\n\n1:02:12.460 --> 1:02:13.800\n I'll do my best.\n\n1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:17.120\n So we returned from, and when I say we,\n\n1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:21.240\n I mean, not my squadron, but VFA 11, the Red Rippers.\n\n1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:24.460\n I was a somewhat junior pilot at the time.\n\n1:02:24.460 --> 1:02:27.540\n I joined them on deployment in 2012,\n\n1:02:27.540 --> 1:02:29.400\n where they had been already out there\n\n1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:30.880\n for about six months or so,\n\n1:02:32.560 --> 1:02:35.200\n operating in the vicinity of Afghanistan.\n\n1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:37.360\n I joined them and then we flew back\n\n1:02:37.360 --> 1:02:39.080\n and still as a relatively new guy,\n\n1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:40.640\n we came back and we entered\n\n1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.000\n what's considered a maintenance phase\n\n1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.440\n where we slow down the tactical flying a bit,\n\n1:02:45.440 --> 1:02:48.340\n kind of recuperate, do some maintenance on the aircraft.\n\n1:02:48.340 --> 1:02:53.340\n And our particular model of the F18, the lot number,\n\n1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:57.640\n was plumbed for the particular things\n\n1:02:57.640 --> 1:02:59.480\n that were needed to upgrade the radar\n\n1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:04.320\n from what's known as the ABG 73 to the ABG 79.\n\n1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.000\n And the ABG 73 is a mechanically scanned array radar.\n\n1:03:10.600 --> 1:03:12.760\n It's a perfectly fine radar,\n\n1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:16.280\n but the AESA radar is kind of a magnitude jump\n\n1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:20.200\n in capability, kind of an analog digital kind of mindset.\n\n1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:23.120\n So it's a leap to digital.\n\n1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:26.760\n ABG 73, so I mean, are these things on a carrier?\n\n1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:28.000\n Like what are we talking about here?\n\n1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.920\n How big is the radar?\n\n1:03:29.920 --> 1:03:32.760\n So this is actually the radars in the F18 itself.\n\n1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:35.000\n Okay, so when you say they were chosen,\n\n1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:40.000\n this is to test the upgrade to the new, the 79, ABG 79.\n\n1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:42.040\n Less of a test and more of just,\n\n1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:43.420\n hey, it's your turn to get the upgrade.\n\n1:03:43.420 --> 1:03:46.080\n Like we're all going to these better radars.\n\n1:03:46.080 --> 1:03:49.480\n They were building ones off the line with the new radar,\n\n1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.560\n but we were this weird transitionary squadron\n\n1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:52.720\n in the middle that transitioned\n\n1:03:52.720 --> 1:03:55.080\n from the older ones to the new ones.\n\n1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:57.280\n But it's not particularly rare to fly with different types\n\n1:03:57.280 --> 1:03:59.280\n of radar because in the,\n\n1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:01.240\n and we call the fleet replacement squadron,\n\n1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:03.700\n essentially the training ground for the F18,\n\n1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:06.120\n you have all sorts of F18s with different radar.\n\n1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:09.440\n So you are used to having multiple ones,\n\n1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:14.440\n but in the actual deployable combat squadron, we upgraded.\n\n1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.680\n And when we upgraded, we saw that there were objects\n\n1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:19.760\n on the radar that we were seeing the next day\n\n1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:23.760\n with this new radar that weren't there with the old radar.\n\n1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.440\n And these were sometimes the same day.\n\n1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.000\n You might go on two flights.\n\n1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.040\n The one in the morning might be with the older radar,\n\n1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:31.560\n the one in the evening with the new radar.\n\n1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:34.560\n And you'd see the objects with the new radar.\n\n1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:37.360\n And that's not overly surprising in some sense.\n\n1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.120\n They are more sensitive.\n\n1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:41.240\n Perhaps they're not filtering out everything\n\n1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:42.080\n they should be yet,\n\n1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:45.520\n or perhaps there's some other type of error.\n\n1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:47.880\n Maybe it needs to be calibrated, whatever.\n\n1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:50.400\n It was relatively new and we were somewhat used\n\n1:04:50.400 --> 1:04:52.320\n to there being software problems\n\n1:04:52.320 --> 1:04:53.760\n with these types of things occasionally,\n\n1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:55.280\n just like anything else.\n\n1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:58.960\n And so, okay, maybe this is a radar software malfunction.\n\n1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.400\n We're getting some false tracks, as we call them.\n\n1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:04.320\n What were you seeing?\n\n1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:08.520\n And so what we would see are representations of the objects.\n\n1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:09.680\n So this is off of our radar.\n\n1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:11.080\n We're not seeing a visual image here.\n\n1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:13.440\n This is kind of like what's being displayed to us\n\n1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:15.120\n almost like in a gaming fashion, right?\n\n1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:16.440\n Like the icon, right?\n\n1:05:16.440 --> 1:05:19.500\n So the icon is showing us, hey, something is there.\n\n1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:21.600\n And here's the parameters I can understand about it.\n\n1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:22.560\n So this is in the cockpit.\n\n1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:26.680\n There's a display that's showing some visualization\n\n1:05:26.680 --> 1:05:27.920\n with the radars detecting.\n\n1:05:27.920 --> 1:05:29.240\n Correct.\n\n1:05:29.240 --> 1:05:30.720\n And there's two different ways to do that.\n\n1:05:30.720 --> 1:05:32.640\n The first one is like the actual data,\n\n1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:37.240\n like the radar where I am,\n\n1:05:37.240 --> 1:05:39.820\n it's showing me the data kind of as if it's in front of me\n\n1:05:39.820 --> 1:05:41.720\n and I'm selecting those contacts.\n\n1:05:41.720 --> 1:05:42.560\n And there's another screen\n\n1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:43.960\n called the situational awareness page.\n\n1:05:43.960 --> 1:05:45.940\n And that's kind of a God's eye view\n\n1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:48.560\n that brings all that data into one spot.\n\n1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:51.840\n And so I'm gonna talk about this from the SA page,\n\n1:05:51.840 --> 1:05:53.040\n from the situational awareness page\n\n1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:54.320\n versus the individual radar ones,\n\n1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:55.880\n because it's easier, but.\n\n1:05:55.880 --> 1:05:57.400\n Can you, sorry to linger on that.\n\n1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:01.040\n So the individual displays are like first person\n\n1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:04.280\n and then SA is,\n\n1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:06.920\n when you say God's eye view, it's like from the top,\n\n1:06:06.920 --> 1:06:09.020\n the integration of all that information\n\n1:06:09.020 --> 1:06:11.720\n as if it's looking down onto the earth.\n\n1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:12.560\n Yes.\n\n1:06:12.560 --> 1:06:13.400\n Is that a good way to summarize it?\n\n1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.200\n It is, but for the aviator, it's slightly different\n\n1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:17.520\n because those two radar displays I talked about\n\n1:06:17.520 --> 1:06:20.200\n are at the bottom of that display\n\n1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:22.420\n is kind of representative of where I am.\n\n1:06:22.420 --> 1:06:24.440\n And so I see what's in front of me.\n\n1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:26.860\n Whereas the situational awareness page,\n\n1:06:26.860 --> 1:06:29.300\n the aircraft is located in the center of that.\n\n1:06:29.300 --> 1:06:33.200\n And then all around me, based off of the data link\n\n1:06:33.200 --> 1:06:35.560\n and wherever I'm getting information from,\n\n1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:37.760\n I can see that whole awareness page.\n\n1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:38.840\n I can see all the situation.\n\n1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:41.460\n So I'm gonna kind of talk about this\n\n1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:43.520\n from the situational awareness page,\n\n1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:46.360\n which is a top down view, just to kind of frame our minds\n\n1:06:46.360 --> 1:06:47.960\n instead of jumping around.\n\n1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:49.200\n And so what we would see out there\n\n1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:50.840\n is we'd see these indications\n\n1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:51.680\n that something would be there\n\n1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:53.560\n and they would have a track file.\n\n1:06:53.560 --> 1:06:56.080\n That track file, that thing that represents the object\n\n1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:57.280\n has a line coming out of it.\n\n1:06:57.280 --> 1:06:58.420\n And that represents,\n\n1:06:58.420 --> 1:07:00.420\n it's called the target aspect indicator.\n\n1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:03.480\n So there's some tracking from the radar.\n\n1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:05.360\n Correct, so it's showing you where the object's going.\n\n1:07:05.360 --> 1:07:07.320\n This is all pretty cool that the radar can do all this.\n\n1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:10.480\n So radar locks in on different objects\n\n1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:11.800\n and it tracks them over time.\n\n1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:12.640\n Correct.\n\n1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:13.480\n That's coming from the radar.\n\n1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:15.400\n That's like a built in feature.\n\n1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:16.240\n Okay, cool.\n\n1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:17.400\n So out there we're seeing it.\n\n1:07:17.400 --> 1:07:18.920\n We don't have to necessarily pull things\n\n1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:22.120\n into our tracker in some sense, right?\n\n1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:22.960\n It's all out there\n\n1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:24.840\n and then we can kind of choose to highlight on stuff\n\n1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:27.520\n or to kind of focus in on it more so.\n\n1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:30.000\n But the information should all be out there.\n\n1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:32.080\n And so we'd see that that target aspect indicator,\n\n1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:34.760\n that line on a typical aircraft,\n\n1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:35.720\n it would kind of look like this.\n\n1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:37.000\n It would be coming out and it would go steady\n\n1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.800\n and if they turned, it would be like boop, boop, boop,\n\n1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:41.080\n and you see them turn, right?\n\n1:07:41.080 --> 1:07:42.160\n It's not magic.\n\n1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:44.280\n But this object, the target aspect\n\n1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:46.600\n would kind of be like all over the place,\n\n1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:49.480\n like kind of randomly in the 360 degrees\n\n1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:52.760\n from that top down view, that line would be in any place.\n\n1:07:52.760 --> 1:07:56.600\n So kind of, is it unable to determine the target aspect?\n\n1:07:56.600 --> 1:07:58.160\n Is it stationary?\n\n1:07:58.160 --> 1:07:59.240\n And that's just how it puts it out\n\n1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:00.280\n and it's not used to seeing it.\n\n1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:02.480\n So I'm not saying that's necessarily super weird,\n\n1:08:02.480 --> 1:08:04.520\n but it was different than what we were used to seeing\n\n1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:06.440\n because we weren't used to seeing stationary objects\n\n1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:07.440\n out there very much.\n\n1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:09.720\n And what was also interesting is that\n\n1:08:09.720 --> 1:08:13.400\n these weren't just stationary on a zero wind day, right?\n\n1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:17.080\n These are stationary at 20,000 feet, 15,000 feet,\n\n1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:21.160\n 500 feet with the wind blowing, you know?\n\n1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:23.760\n And so much like the sea, when we're up there fighting,\n\n1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:24.600\n it affects everything.\n\n1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:27.720\n We consider the wind when we're shooting missiles,\n\n1:08:27.720 --> 1:08:29.600\n when we're flying or fuel considerations,\n\n1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:31.600\n it's like operating in that volume of air,\n\n1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.040\n like the ocean, everything's going with the current.\n\n1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:36.400\n And so anything that doesn't go with the current\n\n1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:38.920\n is immediately kind of identifiable and strange\n\n1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.480\n and that's why these were initially strangers\n\n1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:42.480\n because they would be stationary against the wind.\n\n1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:45.360\n So if you had something like a good drone\n\n1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:47.800\n in a windy conditions, what would that look like?\n\n1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:50.380\n Would it not come off as stationary?\n\n1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:53.280\n Would it sort of float about kind of thing?\n\n1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:55.160\n No, I think with the drone technology we have today,\n\n1:08:55.160 --> 1:08:57.520\n they could stay within a pretty tight location.\n\n1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:00.480\n Well, I meant like DJI drone,\n\n1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:03.040\n I'm saying like generically speaking,\n\n1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:03.880\n not a military drone.\n\n1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.840\n No, I have a DJI drone myself even,\n\n1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:07.960\n and you know, maybe not a hundred knots,\n\n1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:11.120\n but if that thing's in 30 or 40 and not winds,\n\n1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:15.360\n the amount of distance it's going to be kind of\n\n1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.960\n doing one of these, like that change\n\n1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:19.680\n is not something I'm gonna detect from maybe many miles away.\n\n1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:20.520\n Interesting.\n\n1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.560\n So it could look very stationary,\n\n1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:24.160\n but that wasn't necessarily,\n\n1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.080\n and what's interesting about this story\n\n1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:28.200\n is that there's not like the one smoking gun, right?\n\n1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:29.920\n You have to kind of look at everything.\n\n1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:34.260\n And that's what I don't like about the Department of Defense\n\n1:09:34.260 --> 1:09:36.840\n and just generally people's take on this\n\n1:09:36.840 --> 1:09:39.680\n is that everything is kind of based around a single image,\n\n1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:41.540\n you know, or that one case,\n\n1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:44.600\n but a lot of the interestingness comes from the duration\n\n1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:45.600\n or the time it's been out there,\n\n1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.080\n how they're interacting relative to other objects out there.\n\n1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:49.520\n And you don't get that information\n\n1:09:49.520 --> 1:09:52.360\n when you just look at a frame for a second, you know?\n\n1:09:52.360 --> 1:09:54.800\n Everyone kind of bites off on the shiny object, but.\n\n1:09:54.800 --> 1:09:57.360\n So you yourself, from your particular slice\n\n1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.600\n of things you've experienced and seen directly\n\n1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:02.360\n or indirectly, you've kind of built up an intuition\n\n1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:04.960\n about what are the things that were being seen.\n\n1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:05.880\n I wouldn't go that far.\n\n1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:10.440\n I've just been able to eliminate some variables\n\n1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:12.500\n because of how long I've observed it.\n\n1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:14.720\n So like you said, yes, can a drone stay\n\n1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:16.320\n in a particular position against the wind like that?\n\n1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:18.640\n Certainly, but I don't think it can do that\n\n1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:21.520\n and then go 0.8 Mach for four hours after that, you know?\n\n1:10:21.520 --> 1:10:24.700\n And so when you look at outside of that one,\n\n1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:27.800\n that moment in time, then it eliminates\n\n1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:29.440\n a lot of the potential things it could be,\n\n1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:30.720\n at least from my perspective.\n\n1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:33.560\n So what kind of stuff did you see in the instruments?\n\n1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:36.560\n We'd see them flying in patterns,\n\n1:10:36.560 --> 1:10:38.560\n kind of racetrack patterns or circular patterns\n\n1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:40.460\n or just going kind of straight east.\n\n1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:46.120\n Occasionally see them supersonic, 1.1, 1.2 Mach,\n\n1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:48.060\n but typically 0.6 to 0.8 Mach,\n\n1:10:48.060 --> 1:10:51.040\n just for extremely extended periods of time,\n\n1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:53.460\n essentially all the time.\n\n1:10:53.460 --> 1:10:55.160\n And this is airspace where there's not supposed\n\n1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.480\n to be anything else at all.\n\n1:10:57.480 --> 1:10:58.760\n And it's pretty far out there.\n\n1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.460\n It starts 10 miles off the coast, goes like 300 miles.\n\n1:11:01.460 --> 1:11:03.860\n Can you say the location that we're talking about?\n\n1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:05.680\n Off the coast of Virginia Beach.\n\n1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:09.320\n Got it, and so nobody's supposed to be out there?\n\n1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:10.520\n It's possible for people to be there.\n\n1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:12.160\n It's not necessarily restricted,\n\n1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:14.520\n but it's well monitored and we're out there\n\n1:11:14.520 --> 1:11:15.480\n every day, all day.\n\n1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:17.280\n And so people know to stay clear.\n\n1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:18.640\n If a Cessna goes bumbling in there,\n\n1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:19.840\n everyone's gonna know about it.\n\n1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:23.180\n FAA is gonna call them out, gonna tell us about it.\n\n1:11:23.180 --> 1:11:27.040\n So incursions happen, not a big deal,\n\n1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:29.060\n but they're pretty rare, honestly,\n\n1:11:29.060 --> 1:11:30.000\n because everyone knows the area\n\n1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.120\n and we've been operating there for decades.\n\n1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:35.960\n And what are the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 Mach\n\n1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.720\n that these objects were taking?\n\n1:11:38.720 --> 1:11:42.160\n Typically, they would be in some type of circular pattern\n\n1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:44.760\n or kind of racetrack pattern when they were at those speeds,\n\n1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:46.440\n or I just see them kind of,\n\n1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:50.160\n and it wasn't always like a mechanical flight description.\n\n1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:52.240\n And when I say that, I mean like an autopilot\n\n1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:54.560\n is gonna be just very precise, right?\n\n1:11:54.560 --> 1:11:56.520\n It's gonna be locked on straight.\n\n1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:57.760\n Whereas I could see an airplane,\n\n1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:59.280\n I could tell if the pilot's flying it, right?\n\n1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:01.000\n Because it's not gonna be perfect.\n\n1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.320\n The computer's not controlling it.\n\n1:12:02.320 --> 1:12:03.760\n And these seemed more like that.\n\n1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:05.340\n Not that they were imprecise,\n\n1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:07.840\n but that they were even much more erratic than that.\n\n1:12:07.840 --> 1:12:10.080\n So like, it wasn't like a straight line in a turn.\n\n1:12:10.080 --> 1:12:13.200\n It was just kind of like a weird drift like that\n\n1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:14.520\n in that direction.\n\n1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:17.360\n So it wasn't controlled by a dumb computer,\n\n1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:20.120\n or not disrespect to computers.\n\n1:12:20.120 --> 1:12:23.000\n So it wasn't controlled by autopilot kind of technology.\n\n1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.600\n That's not the sense that I got.\n\n1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:28.880\n So how many people have seen them in the squadron?\n\n1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:31.800\n Sort of how many times were they seen?\n\n1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:36.400\n How many were there times when there's multiple objects?\n\n1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.320\n Once we started seeing them on the radar enough,\n\n1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:39.200\n and we would get close enough,\n\n1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:40.860\n we'd actually see them on our FLIR as well.\n\n1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:45.080\n So our advanced targeting pod.\n\n1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:47.320\n It's essentially a infrared camera\n\n1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:48.500\n that we use for targeting,\n\n1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:51.040\n mostly in the air to surface environment.\n\n1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:52.880\n We don't use it in the air to air arena.\n\n1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:56.120\n It's just not that good of a tool, frankly.\n\n1:12:56.120 --> 1:13:00.480\n But we would see IR energy emitting from that location\n\n1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:01.780\n where the radar was dropping us off.\n\n1:13:01.780 --> 1:13:03.960\n So the radar, we'd lock onto the object\n\n1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:05.520\n and our sensors would all look there.\n\n1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:06.960\n And so then we could see that it's looking\n\n1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.040\n at that right piece of sky,\n\n1:13:08.040 --> 1:13:11.080\n but there's energy actually coming from there.\n\n1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:12.460\n So now we started thinking that, okay,\n\n1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:14.680\n maybe not radar malfunctions, maybe more,\n\n1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:16.680\n maybe something is physically here, of course.\n\n1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:19.080\n And then people started to try to fly by it and see it.\n\n1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:22.400\n And at this point, I would say maybe 80 to 90%\n\n1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:23.760\n of our squadron had probably seen one of these\n\n1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:24.720\n on the radar at this point.\n\n1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.320\n Everyone was aware of it.\n\n1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.200\n There was small communication, I think,\n\n1:13:28.200 --> 1:13:31.600\n between squadrons of the same area that had the same radar.\n\n1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.120\n So I knew it wasn't just our squadron\n\n1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:35.120\n for whatever strange reason,\n\n1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:36.720\n because other squadrons would be out there\n\n1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:37.560\n and we would talk to them,\n\n1:13:37.560 --> 1:13:39.560\n like, hey, careful, there's an object.\n\n1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:40.480\n Are you aware of that?\n\n1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:42.760\n So they would be aware of it.\n\n1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:44.440\n And then, of course, people would want to go see\n\n1:13:44.440 --> 1:13:45.320\n what they look like, right?\n\n1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:46.840\n So people would try to fly by it.\n\n1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:48.240\n I try to fly by it.\n\n1:13:48.240 --> 1:13:50.280\n I like how that's an of course.\n\n1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:51.200\n Of course.\n\n1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:53.000\n Of course you don't want to fly by it.\n\n1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:57.880\n There's an argument against that kind of perspective\n\n1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:00.600\n that maybe the thing is dangerous, so maybe we don't.\n\n1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:02.400\n But perhaps that's part of the reason\n\n1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:03.240\n you want to fly by it,\n\n1:14:03.240 --> 1:14:05.760\n is to understand better what it is if it's a threat.\n\n1:14:05.760 --> 1:14:08.120\n We have a lot of context now that we didn't back then.\n\n1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:10.320\n So it was still, hey, is this a balloon?\n\n1:14:10.320 --> 1:14:12.360\n Is this a drone at a certain point?\n\n1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:14.800\n And we're also aware of potential intelligence gathering\n\n1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:17.000\n operations that could be going on.\n\n1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:18.560\n We're up there flying our tactics.\n\n1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:20.080\n We're emitting.\n\n1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:22.960\n We're practicing our EW.\n\n1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:24.560\n We're turning at particular times.\n\n1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:25.640\n There's stuff that can be learned.\n\n1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:26.480\n It's not a secret.\n\n1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:29.800\n And countries keep different fishing vessels and whatnot\n\n1:14:29.800 --> 1:14:31.200\n in international waters off there.\n\n1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:32.720\n So it's not exactly a secret\n\n1:14:32.720 --> 1:14:35.360\n that we're being observed out there.\n\n1:14:35.360 --> 1:14:38.920\n So to think that a foreign nation would want to\n\n1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:42.120\n somehow intercept information,\n\n1:14:42.120 --> 1:14:46.720\n whether that's our radar signals or jamming capabilities\n\n1:14:46.720 --> 1:14:49.920\n to try to break that down or understand it better,\n\n1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:53.240\n be ready for that next fight, I mean,\n\n1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.720\n that's what scares me about this scenario\n\n1:14:55.720 --> 1:14:59.000\n because we didn't jump right to aliens or UFOs.\n\n1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.480\n We thought, this is a radar malfunction\n\n1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:02.320\n we need to be aware of.\n\n1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:03.160\n It's a safety issue.\n\n1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:06.320\n And then this could be a tactical problem right here\n\n1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:09.920\n because everything we do is based off a crypto\n\n1:15:09.920 --> 1:15:13.600\n and locations, everything's classified we do out there.\n\n1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:15.560\n And so over time, if you gather enough data\n\n1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.840\n about those fights and just monitor them forever,\n\n1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:21.480\n just like some nations do with other\n\n1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:23.080\n piece of technology or software,\n\n1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:25.520\n they could probably learn a lot.\n\n1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:27.080\n So we have to be cognizant of the fact\n\n1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:28.200\n and defend against it.\n\n1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:32.600\n So what can you say about the other characteristics\n\n1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:36.400\n of these objects like shape, size,\n\n1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:43.320\n texture, luminosity, how else do you describe object?\n\n1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:45.160\n Is there something that could be said?\n\n1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:47.920\n So you said like this is a tech town radar step one.\n\n1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:50.960\n Now you have FLIR images that can give you a sense\n\n1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:52.920\n that that's actually a physical object.\n\n1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:55.680\n What else can be said about those physical objects?\n\n1:15:55.680 --> 1:15:59.400\n So eventually someone did see one with their own eyeballs,\n\n1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:02.200\n multiple people and they saw it\n\n1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.720\n in a somewhat interesting way.\n\n1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:08.720\n The object presented itself at the exact altitude\n\n1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:11.360\n and geographic location of the entry points\n\n1:16:11.360 --> 1:16:13.200\n into our working areas.\n\n1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:16.200\n So we enter at a very specific point at a certain altitude\n\n1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:18.080\n and people leave the areas at the same point\n\n1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:19.640\n at a lower altitude.\n\n1:16:19.640 --> 1:16:21.520\n Probably one of the busiest pieces of sky\n\n1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.000\n on the eastern seaboard.\n\n1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:24.720\n So two jets from my squadron went out\n\n1:16:24.720 --> 1:16:26.520\n and they went flying and they entered the area\n\n1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:28.520\n and one of these objects went right between the aircraft.\n\n1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.240\n So they're flying in formation\n\n1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:32.320\n and the object went between the aircraft.\n\n1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:33.680\n They went between the object I think.\n\n1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:35.720\n I don't think that the object was moving.\n\n1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.320\n I don't think it aggressively went at them.\n\n1:16:37.320 --> 1:16:39.440\n I think it was located still there\n\n1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:41.000\n and then they flew through it.\n\n1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.600\n But they didn't have it on their radar.\n\n1:16:43.600 --> 1:16:48.040\n And I think the radar might have been malfunctioning.\n\n1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:48.960\n I don't know that for sure.\n\n1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:50.280\n I would like to look into it\n\n1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:53.520\n but my supposition is that if their radar was malfunctioning\n\n1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:55.600\n it would make sense that they wouldn't avoid the object\n\n1:16:55.600 --> 1:16:56.440\n that was there\n\n1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:59.120\n because they knew these were physical at that point.\n\n1:16:59.120 --> 1:17:02.040\n And we would go up to these objects all the time\n\n1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:03.760\n and try to see them and couldn't see them.\n\n1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.320\n And we didn't know what it was.\n\n1:17:05.320 --> 1:17:07.640\n Was it, were they just not there or being fooled?\n\n1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:08.600\n Was something happening?\n\n1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:11.880\n Were they moving, dropping altitude at the last minute?\n\n1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:14.520\n We're going by pretty quick so it's difficult to tell.\n\n1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:16.960\n But perhaps if his radar wasn't working\n\n1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:19.440\n it wasn't receiving energy from the jet.\n\n1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.640\n And the jet of course didn't know that it was there.\n\n1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:24.120\n And so whatever the case was, they flew right by\n\n1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:28.280\n and they described it just as a dark gray or black cube\n\n1:17:29.240 --> 1:17:31.760\n inside a clear translucent sphere.\n\n1:17:31.760 --> 1:17:33.400\n And the kind of the apex of the cube\n\n1:17:33.400 --> 1:17:35.240\n or touching the inside of that sphere.\n\n1:17:35.240 --> 1:17:39.520\n That's an image that's haunting.\n\n1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:41.040\n So what do they think it is?\n\n1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:43.680\n What did they think at that moment?\n\n1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:47.080\n That they, is it just this kind of cloud of uncertainty\n\n1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:50.200\n that they're just describing a geometric object?\n\n1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:54.080\n It's not on radar so it's unclear what it is.\n\n1:17:55.280 --> 1:18:00.000\n Yeah, what was the, any kind of other description\n\n1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:02.600\n they've had of it in terms of the intuition\n\n1:18:02.600 --> 1:18:03.880\n from a pilot's perspective?\n\n1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:06.240\n You have to kind of identify what a thing is.\n\n1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:08.400\n To answer the first part,\n\n1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:10.360\n they actually canceled the flight and came back\n\n1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:12.800\n because they were, it's like if there's one of these\n\n1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:14.000\n out here and we're almost hitting them\n\n1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.680\n and it's right there, then perhaps we need\n\n1:18:16.680 --> 1:18:18.920\n to get a different jet with better radar.\n\n1:18:18.920 --> 1:18:20.400\n So they came back and they're in their gear\n\n1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:22.520\n and they're talking to the front desk\n\n1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:23.600\n and talking to Skipper and like,\n\n1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:25.720\n hey, we almost hit one of those damn things out there.\n\n1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.080\n And this kind of was one of those kind of\n\n1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:30.040\n slight watershed moments where we all were kind of like,\n\n1:18:30.040 --> 1:18:32.480\n all right, like this is a serious deal now.\n\n1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:35.640\n Maybe it was a, maybe we thought they were balloons\n\n1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:37.920\n or drones or malfunctions, or maybe we thought it was fine.\n\n1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:38.800\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:18:38.800 --> 1:18:39.920\n if we're gonna hit one of these things,\n\n1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:43.400\n then we need to take care of the situation.\n\n1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:46.080\n And that's actually when we started submitting\n\n1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:50.720\n hazard reports or hazard reps to the Naval Aviation Safety\n\n1:18:52.440 --> 1:18:53.600\n kind of communication network.\n\n1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:56.520\n And it's not like a big proactive thing\n\n1:18:56.520 --> 1:18:57.640\n where people are gonna go investigate.\n\n1:18:57.640 --> 1:18:59.240\n It's more of a data collection mechanism\n\n1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.440\n so that you can kind of share that aggregate data\n\n1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:03.840\n and make sure that things are progressing.\n\n1:19:04.720 --> 1:19:06.960\n So it wasn't a mechanism that would result\n\n1:19:06.960 --> 1:19:09.240\n in action being taken, but we were hoping\n\n1:19:09.240 --> 1:19:11.080\n to at least get the message out to whomever\n\n1:19:11.080 --> 1:19:12.800\n was maybe running a classified program\n\n1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:14.520\n that we were not aware of or something like that,\n\n1:19:14.520 --> 1:19:16.320\n that hey, like you could kill somebody here.\n\n1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:19.120\n Like you've grown too big for your bridges here.\n\n1:19:19.120 --> 1:19:20.680\n Take a step back.\n\n1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:22.720\n So that was our concern at that point.\n\n1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:25.040\n That's kind of where we were thinking this was going.\n\n1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:27.280\n What's the protocol for shooting at a thing?\n\n1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:31.360\n Was there a concern that it's a direct threat,\n\n1:19:31.360 --> 1:19:36.320\n not just surveillance, but a thing that could be a threat?\n\n1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:37.360\n At least from my perspective,\n\n1:19:37.360 --> 1:19:39.480\n like that never really crossed into my mind.\n\n1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:44.000\n I thought it was potentially an intelligence failure\n\n1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:46.800\n that could be being watched and information gathered.\n\n1:19:46.800 --> 1:19:48.400\n But I didn't think that it was something\n\n1:19:48.400 --> 1:19:53.040\n that would proactively engage me in a hostile manner.\n\n1:19:53.040 --> 1:19:55.320\n It wouldn't really make sense either too.\n\n1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:57.240\n It would be shocking to like have one of these objects\n\n1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.400\n take out an F18, but there's no real tactical advantage\n\n1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:01.640\n other than fear perhaps.\n\n1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:04.000\n Psychological, yeah.\n\n1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:08.080\n I've learned a lot about the psychological warfare\n\n1:20:08.080 --> 1:20:11.600\n in Ukraine as a big part of the war\n\n1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:14.000\n in terms of when you talk about siege warfare,\n\n1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:17.960\n about wars that last for many years, for many months,\n\n1:20:17.960 --> 1:20:20.560\n and then perhaps could extend to years.\n\n1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:24.760\n But yes, it didn't seem,\n\n1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:29.760\n it didn't fit your conception of a threatening entity.\n\n1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:30.720\n Correct.\n\n1:20:32.440 --> 1:20:35.840\n So looking back now from all the pieces of data\n\n1:20:35.840 --> 1:20:39.160\n you've integrated, you've personally added,\n\n1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:40.900\n what do you think it could be?\n\n1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:42.920\n I don't know.\n\n1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:44.120\n I don't know what it could be.\n\n1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:47.080\n I think we've been able to categorize it successfully\n\n1:20:47.080 --> 1:20:48.600\n into a few buckets.\n\n1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:51.880\n We've been able to say that this could be US technology\n\n1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:55.920\n that someone put in the wrong piece of sky\n\n1:20:55.920 --> 1:21:00.040\n or perhaps was developed and tested in an inappropriate spot\n\n1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:02.880\n by someone that wasn't being best practices.\n\n1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:04.520\n Is there, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:08.380\n is there a sort of modularity to the way\n\n1:21:08.380 --> 1:21:10.900\n the military operates, the way it's possible\n\n1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:13.920\n for one branch not to know about the tests of another?\n\n1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:15.680\n Yeah, I think it's perfectly reasonable\n\n1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:17.680\n to think that that could occur, right?\n\n1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:19.820\n And so if we just make that assumption,\n\n1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:21.920\n we can integrate that into our analysis here\n\n1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.640\n and just say, okay, but at the point we're at now,\n\n1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:26.440\n we have to assume that that's not the case, right?\n\n1:21:26.440 --> 1:21:27.820\n With everything that's been going on\n\n1:21:27.820 --> 1:21:30.280\n and the statements have been made and the hearings,\n\n1:21:30.280 --> 1:21:35.280\n I think that if it was a noncommunication issue,\n\n1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:37.280\n we're in big trouble at this point.\n\n1:21:37.280 --> 1:21:40.480\n What about it being an object from another nation,\n\n1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.680\n from China, from Russia?\n\n1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:44.300\n Or even one of our allies, perhaps, right?\n\n1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:49.040\n Maybe that's, you know, I don't think it's controversial\n\n1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:51.360\n to say that our allies could be gathering information\n\n1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:52.520\n about us or anything of that nature,\n\n1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:54.000\n but that would be an extreme case,\n\n1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:55.760\n but I think it's just important to say, right?\n\n1:21:55.760 --> 1:21:57.440\n To not just say Russia or China\n\n1:21:57.440 --> 1:21:58.680\n and just call them the bad guys\n\n1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:01.580\n and assume that if they don't have it, no one can do it.\n\n1:22:01.580 --> 1:22:03.720\n And so from my perspective, you know, anyone else,\n\n1:22:03.720 --> 1:22:05.000\n anyone else, and it doesn't necessarily need\n\n1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000\n to be a foreign power.\n\n1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.380\n It could be a non government entity, perhaps,\n\n1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:10.880\n although I think that's very unlikely.\n\n1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:13.360\n But again, these are things you must consider\n\n1:22:13.360 --> 1:22:15.720\n if you kind of throw everything,\n\n1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:18.600\n everything other than the US under scrutiny.\n\n1:22:18.600 --> 1:22:21.400\n But you know, from what has been reported\n\n1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:23.920\n and the behaviors that have been seen,\n\n1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:26.720\n it would be, I would expect to see remnants\n\n1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:29.920\n of that technology elsewhere in the economy.\n\n1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:32.280\n There seems to be too many things\n\n1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:35.660\n that require advanced technology\n\n1:22:35.660 --> 1:22:37.880\n that would be beneficial commercially,\n\n1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:40.120\n as well as in other military applications\n\n1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:42.200\n for it to be completely locked away\n\n1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:44.160\n by one of our competitors.\n\n1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.320\n Now I could see us perhaps locking something away\n\n1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:47.520\n if we're already in the lead\n\n1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:50.600\n and having it to pull out as needed.\n\n1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:53.520\n But for someone that's perhaps in a power struggle\n\n1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:55.080\n and they're in second place,\n\n1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:57.360\n they might be more aggressive with the development\n\n1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.760\n of different types of technology\n\n1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:00.640\n willing to accept bigger risks.\n\n1:23:00.640 --> 1:23:03.400\n Do you think it could be natural phenomena\n\n1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:06.160\n that we don't yet understand?\n\n1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:08.420\n I think that there are a number of things\n\n1:23:08.420 --> 1:23:09.720\n that this is going to be, right?\n\n1:23:09.720 --> 1:23:11.360\n I don't think there's one thing at the end of the day,\n\n1:23:11.360 --> 1:23:13.340\n but I certainly think that that is part\n\n1:23:13.340 --> 1:23:14.580\n of what some of this could be.\n\n1:23:14.580 --> 1:23:17.640\n I don't think it's what we were seeing on the East Coast,\n\n1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:20.360\n and I don't think it is related to the Roosevelt incident,\n\n1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:22.940\n or I'll even go out and say the Nimitz incident, but.\n\n1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:24.480\n What's the Roosevelt incident?\n\n1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:28.000\n The Roosevelt incident, typically referred to as the gimbal\n\n1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.460\n and or the go fast video.\n\n1:23:29.460 --> 1:23:33.240\n And then the Nimitz is from what the David Fravor\n\n1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:36.000\n has witnessed directly and spoken about.\n\n1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:37.140\n We'll talk about that as well.\n\n1:23:37.140 --> 1:23:42.000\n I'd just love to get your sort of interpretation\n\n1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:42.840\n of those incidents.\n\n1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:45.560\n But yeah, so in this particular case,\n\n1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:48.720\n natural phenomena could be a part of the picture,\n\n1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:50.920\n but you're saying not the whole picture.\n\n1:23:50.920 --> 1:23:53.340\n Yes, yes, and we can't discount it.\n\n1:23:54.400 --> 1:23:57.440\n Oh, the other thing is what about the failure\n\n1:23:57.440 --> 1:24:00.480\n of pilot eyesight?\n\n1:24:00.480 --> 1:24:05.480\n Like sort of some deep mixture of actual direct vision,\n\n1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:10.960\n human vision system failure, and like psychology.\n\n1:24:10.960 --> 1:24:15.960\n Like seeing something weird and then filling in the gaps.\n\n1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:20.820\n Because in order to make sense of the weird.\n\n1:24:20.820 --> 1:24:25.820\n I've tried to expose myself to scenarios like that\n\n1:24:25.920 --> 1:24:28.060\n that I don't necessarily think are right,\n\n1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:31.360\n but I've explored them to see if they could have some truth.\n\n1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:34.080\n And one example is let's imagine a scenario\n\n1:24:34.080 --> 1:24:35.520\n where if we're seeing these objects every day\n\n1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:38.760\n off the East Coast, I can imagine a technology\n\n1:24:38.760 --> 1:24:41.440\n or an operation where you had some type\n\n1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.560\n of traditional propulsion system operating drones\n\n1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:47.680\n in order to gather data like we had discussed.\n\n1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:51.640\n And I could envision a clever enough adversary\n\n1:24:51.640 --> 1:24:54.640\n that could perhaps destroy or somehow remove these objects\n\n1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:56.880\n and replace them with new objects essentially\n\n1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:58.080\n when we're not looking, right?\n\n1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:02.480\n And that accounts for the large airborne time.\n\n1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.920\n And so I explore options like that\n\n1:25:04.920 --> 1:25:08.280\n and I try to see what evidence and assumptions\n\n1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:11.440\n need to be made in order to prove or disprove that.\n\n1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.640\n And you would need so much infrastructure.\n\n1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:16.360\n You'd need so many assets.\n\n1:25:16.360 --> 1:25:18.720\n And so I try to explore some of those fallacies\n\n1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:20.040\n and some of those concerns.\n\n1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:23.200\n And as aviators, we're trained into many\n\n1:25:23.200 --> 1:25:24.920\n like actual physical, like eyesight\n\n1:25:24.920 --> 1:25:26.800\n and kind of illusion training.\n\n1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:28.520\n So like at nighttime flying,\n\n1:25:28.520 --> 1:25:29.680\n there's so many things that can happen\n\n1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:30.920\n flying with false horizons.\n\n1:25:30.920 --> 1:25:34.880\n And so we receive hours of training on that type of stuff,\n\n1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:37.320\n but this just falls outside the category\n\n1:25:37.320 --> 1:25:38.360\n from my perspective.\n\n1:25:38.360 --> 1:25:40.600\n What was the visibility conditions\n\n1:25:40.600 --> 1:25:42.960\n in the times when people were able to see it?\n\n1:25:42.960 --> 1:25:47.960\n And we just earlier discussed complete nighttime, darkness.\n\n1:25:50.360 --> 1:25:53.040\n In this case, was it during the day?\n\n1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:56.000\n It was a perfectly clear day that particular incident, yep.\n\n1:25:57.440 --> 1:25:59.040\n In a world that's full of mystery,\n\n1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:02.720\n I have to ask what do you think is the possibility\n\n1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:07.720\n that it's not of this earth origin?\n\n1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:11.280\n I like the term nonhuman intelligence in a sense,\n\n1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:16.040\n because again, there's a lot of assumptions in there\n\n1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:18.920\n that may cause us to go down the wrong roads.\n\n1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:21.960\n It could, you know, these could be something\n\n1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:24.200\n that are weather phenomena of earth, right?\n\n1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:26.920\n Or something else that is just something we don't understand\n\n1:26:26.920 --> 1:26:30.280\n and can't imagine right now that's still of this earth.\n\n1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:33.160\n If we consider extraterrestrials or something\n\n1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:37.480\n that came from a physical place far away in space time,\n\n1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:39.840\n you know, that leads us to some detection assumptions\n\n1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:40.960\n that we would need to make.\n\n1:26:40.960 --> 1:26:43.760\n And so I just try to not categorize it under anything\n\n1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:47.040\n and just say, hey, is this demonstrating intelligence?\n\n1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:49.160\n And start from there as a single object.\n\n1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:50.760\n What can we learn about it kinematically?\n\n1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:51.600\n How it's performing?\n\n1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:53.520\n What does that mean for its energy source?\n\n1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:56.000\n What does that mean for the G forces inside?\n\n1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.320\n And then step it out a level and say, okay,\n\n1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:00.120\n how are these interacting with our fighters?\n\n1:27:00.120 --> 1:27:02.080\n If they are, how are they interacting with the weather\n\n1:27:02.080 --> 1:27:03.280\n and their environment?\n\n1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:04.840\n How are they interacting with each other?\n\n1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.920\n So can we look at these and how they're interacting\n\n1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:09.840\n perhaps as a swarm, especially off the East coast\n\n1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:12.680\n where this is happening all the time with multiple objects.\n\n1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:13.520\n Right?\n\n1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:15.040\n And so we might be able to determine some things\n\n1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:17.480\n about their maybe, you know, sensor capabilities\n\n1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:20.320\n or the areas of focus, you know, if we can determine\n\n1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:22.720\n how they're working in conjunction with each other.\n\n1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:25.120\n But, you know, seeing one little flash of an object\n\n1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:26.960\n doesn't provide that type of insight.\n\n1:27:26.960 --> 1:27:30.720\n But we have the systems for it, and it's kind of,\n\n1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:33.440\n you know, an irony, but it's a fact of life,\n\n1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.320\n the reality that many of these well deployed,\n\n1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:40.140\n highly capable systems are held under the military umbrella,\n\n1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:42.440\n which makes it difficult to provide that data\n\n1:27:42.440 --> 1:27:44.480\n for scientific analysis.\n\n1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:48.120\n So there's probably a lot more data on these objects\n\n1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:51.600\n that's not being, that's not made available,\n\n1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:54.920\n probably even within the military for analysis.\n\n1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:55.760\n I think so.\n\n1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.160\n Yeah, I think there's a lot of data\n\n1:27:57.160 --> 1:27:58.760\n that could be made available.\n\n1:27:58.760 --> 1:28:01.840\n And, you know, that's one of the reasons why, you know,\n\n1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:04.480\n I've been engaged with the American Institute of Aeronautics\n\n1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:07.160\n and Astronautics to build, you know,\n\n1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:10.520\n a large resources of cross domain expertise\n\n1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:13.120\n so that if or when that data is available\n\n1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:15.760\n or that there's additional analysis needed, you know,\n\n1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.600\n we can spin up those teams and make that analysis.\n\n1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:22.120\n So there was a recently a house intelligence subcommittee\n\n1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:25.080\n hearing on UFOs that you were a part of.\n\n1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:26.560\n What was the goal of that hearing?\n\n1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:30.800\n And can you maybe summarize what you heard?\n\n1:28:30.800 --> 1:28:33.360\n The hearings, from my perspective,\n\n1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:36.540\n seemed a bit disingenuous, kind of top level.\n\n1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:37.680\n I think...\n\n1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:39.420\n Who was it run by, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:41.400\n like who were the people involved\n\n1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:43.160\n and what was the goal, the stated goal?\n\n1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:46.080\n Congressman Andre Carson did chair the committee\n\n1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:48.160\n and he was, I think, ultimately responsible\n\n1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:49.760\n for bringing it all together.\n\n1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:51.440\n You know, I think the intent from Congress\n\n1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:54.500\n was to try to bring light to what has been happening\n\n1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:58.000\n with the Navy and to help show the American people\n\n1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.800\n that Congress is taking this serious\n\n1:29:00.800 --> 1:29:02.760\n because something serious is happening.\n\n1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.640\n But, you know, the sense I got seemed a bit disingenuous.\n\n1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:06.880\n They talked around it a lot.\n\n1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:11.880\n They, you know, advertised their love of science fiction,\n\n1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:14.640\n but they, you know, they didn't treat this,\n\n1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.320\n I would say, in the manner it deserved\n\n1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:17.600\n as a potential tactical threat\n\n1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:20.240\n if it's coming from a foreign power.\n\n1:29:20.240 --> 1:29:21.560\n And I get it though, at the same day,\n\n1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:24.440\n they have very specific objectives\n\n1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:25.840\n within the DOD, right?\n\n1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:27.320\n They have a very important job.\n\n1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:29.840\n Their job isn't necessarily to do exploratory science\n\n1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:30.680\n for no reason.\n\n1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:35.380\n So I applaud and I encourage their efforts\n\n1:29:35.380 --> 1:29:38.280\n on the intelligence side to help understand this,\n\n1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:41.380\n but my concern is that they play a role\n\n1:29:41.380 --> 1:29:44.400\n they're not well suited for, which is doing science.\n\n1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:46.160\n And the Pentagon has opened a new office\n\n1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:47.600\n to investigate UFOs called\n\n1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:50.720\n All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\n\n1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:52.380\n What do you think about this office?\n\n1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:55.760\n Do you think it can help alleviate in a way\n\n1:29:55.760 --> 1:29:58.840\n which this hearing perhaps has failed\n\n1:29:58.840 --> 1:30:01.920\n to improve more the scientific rigor\n\n1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:05.180\n and the seriousness of investigating UFOs?\n\n1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:07.680\n I think that remains to be seen.\n\n1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:09.400\n I think it's a step in the right direction,\n\n1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:10.880\n but it's a step that was taken\n\n1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:14.060\n because the previous step didn't happen, right?\n\n1:30:14.060 --> 1:30:18.720\n So the AOI MSG was the progeny, essentially,\n\n1:30:18.720 --> 1:30:21.480\n of the AARO or AERO.\n\n1:30:21.480 --> 1:30:25.880\n And the name was changed because nothing was happening\n\n1:30:25.880 --> 1:30:29.080\n and it was essentially just a confusing mess of words\n\n1:30:29.080 --> 1:30:31.480\n that were created to make this topic unpalatable.\n\n1:30:32.720 --> 1:30:34.520\n The Airborne Objects Identification\n\n1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:36.720\n Synchronization Management Group.\n\n1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:38.280\n Quite the mouthful.\n\n1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:39.960\n I practice that.\n\n1:30:39.960 --> 1:30:43.080\n But the new All Domain Anomaly Resolution Office,\n\n1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:44.320\n from my perspective at least,\n\n1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:46.240\n at least the perspective that they're putting out,\n\n1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:48.240\n they seem to want to be open.\n\n1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:50.440\n They put out a Twitter handle,\n\n1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:52.360\n they're going out on Twitter and communicating,\n\n1:30:52.360 --> 1:30:54.600\n saying they want to keep this open.\n\n1:30:54.600 --> 1:30:57.600\n But that's gonna run into a classification wall.\n\n1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:02.600\n Well, so Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick seems like an interesting guy.\n\n1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:04.760\n He does, yes.\n\n1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:08.960\n So he's got a, Evan looked in too deeply,\n\n1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:11.320\n but he seems to have sort of,\n\n1:31:11.320 --> 1:31:13.560\n he's coming from like a science research perspective,\n\n1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:15.780\n like a background.\n\n1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:20.780\n So he might be, at least in the right mindset,\n\n1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:25.820\n the right background to kind of lead a serious investigation.\n\n1:31:25.820 --> 1:31:26.660\n I think so.\n\n1:31:26.660 --> 1:31:28.360\n I'll just say generally,\n\n1:31:28.360 --> 1:31:31.120\n the office has been receptive to AIAA reaching out\n\n1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:35.040\n in order to collaborate, which has been a positive sign.\n\n1:31:35.040 --> 1:31:38.560\n Also pass the same kudos to Dr. Spergel\n\n1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.060\n and NASA's effort as well.\n\n1:31:42.060 --> 1:31:44.760\n I see these organizations that are standing up,\n\n1:31:44.760 --> 1:31:47.800\n I do see them as good faith efforts\n\n1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:51.920\n that are coming about through a lot of difficulty\n\n1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:53.960\n and negotiation most likely, right?\n\n1:31:53.960 --> 1:31:57.360\n And I see these as a small door opening\n\n1:31:57.360 --> 1:31:58.640\n that if we can take advantage of,\n\n1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:01.760\n can lead to a much more productive relationship\n\n1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:03.480\n between these organizations.\n\n1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:05.960\n How do you put pressure on this kind of thing?\n\n1:32:05.960 --> 1:32:08.280\n Does it come from the civilian leadership?\n\n1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:10.760\n Does it come from sort of Congress and presidents?\n\n1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:12.480\n Does it come from the public?\n\n1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:15.320\n Does the public have any power to put pressure on this?\n\n1:32:15.320 --> 1:32:19.000\n Or is the giant wall of bureaucracy\n\n1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.920\n going to protect it against any public pressure?\n\n1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:22.840\n What do you think?\n\n1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:25.840\n I think we've been in that latter state for a while,\n\n1:32:25.840 --> 1:32:29.880\n but society seems to be a bit different nowadays.\n\n1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:32.360\n We have the ability to communicate and to group\n\n1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:34.560\n and to form relationships in a way\n\n1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:37.480\n that hasn't been able to be present in the past.\n\n1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:40.160\n We've been able to do research for better or worse\n\n1:32:40.160 --> 1:32:43.880\n on our own in a way that hasn't been able to happen before.\n\n1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:47.160\n And so I sense that people are a bit less willing\n\n1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.240\n to kind of buy the bottom line statement\n\n1:32:49.240 --> 1:32:52.240\n from those in power as they used to be\n\n1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:54.800\n back when they didn't have access to those tools.\n\n1:32:54.800 --> 1:32:56.640\n And so I do think there is a massive role\n\n1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:59.560\n for the general society, general populace to play\n\n1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:02.040\n to show that they are interested in this.\n\n1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:05.200\n Because it's not that I don't think the politicians\n\n1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:07.920\n or the leaders in the Pentagon,\n\n1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:10.480\n it's not that they don't like this topic necessarily\n\n1:33:10.480 --> 1:33:12.160\n or think it's toxic per se,\n\n1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:15.000\n but they exist in a culture where this has been toxic\n\n1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:16.800\n and they don't feel comfortable talking about it.\n\n1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:19.360\n And these are people that have spent their entire careers\n\n1:33:19.360 --> 1:33:21.560\n working towards a goal and getting to very high positions\n\n1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:22.640\n within government.\n\n1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:24.480\n And so this is very against their nature\n\n1:33:24.480 --> 1:33:26.760\n to take a stance on a topic like this.\n\n1:33:28.200 --> 1:33:30.640\n And so the fact that these are standing up,\n\n1:33:30.640 --> 1:33:32.520\n even if they do have a small budget\n\n1:33:32.520 --> 1:33:34.360\n or if they struggled a bit at first,\n\n1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:36.640\n I still think it's a massive change\n\n1:33:36.640 --> 1:33:38.760\n and it's a big step away from that stigma\n\n1:33:38.760 --> 1:33:41.640\n that has been pervading this topic for so long.\n\n1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:45.720\n And you're actually part of alleviating the stigma\n\n1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:49.680\n for somebody that's as credible, as intelligent,\n\n1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:53.120\n as varied in background, able to speak about these things.\n\n1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:55.200\n That's a big risk that you took,\n\n1:33:55.200 --> 1:33:56.960\n but it's extremely valuable\n\n1:33:56.960 --> 1:33:59.800\n because it's alleviating the stigma.\n\n1:33:59.800 --> 1:34:00.720\n I thank you for saying that,\n\n1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:03.480\n but it didn't feel like much of a risk for me.\n\n1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:06.480\n I didn't come out about aliens or whatever.\n\n1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:10.080\n I had a safety problem that I started asking questions about.\n\n1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:12.200\n And I went down a road\n\n1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:15.640\n as a Navy trained aviation safety officer, right?\n\n1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:16.960\n That sent me to school for six weeks\n\n1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:18.960\n and Pensacola would be a safety officer.\n\n1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:21.760\n We're almost hitting these objects\n\n1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:23.920\n and it's not something that happened in the past\n\n1:34:23.920 --> 1:34:25.840\n and we want to understand it, it's happening right now.\n\n1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:28.280\n Like these occurrences are still happening.\n\n1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:29.920\n Aviators are flying right now,\n\n1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:31.200\n are still flying by these things.\n\n1:34:31.200 --> 1:34:34.720\n And in fact, I mentioned I was an instructor pilot.\n\n1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:39.720\n And I had a student call me about eight months ago or so.\n\n1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:43.720\n And he's like, hey, sir, I made it to the fleet finally.\n\n1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:44.960\n I had trained him how to fly.\n\n1:34:44.960 --> 1:34:47.880\n And then he goes to F18, he goes another year of training.\n\n1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:50.120\n And then he gets out to his squadron on the East Coast\n\n1:34:50.120 --> 1:34:53.680\n and he's flying with a senior member of the base,\n\n1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:58.440\n NAS Oceana, where the fighters fly out of Senior 0506.\n\n1:34:58.440 --> 1:35:00.280\n And it was kind of a bad weather day.\n\n1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:02.360\n And so they said, hey, if the weather's not good enough\n\n1:35:02.360 --> 1:35:04.240\n for us to do this dog fighting set,\n\n1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.720\n we'll go out and do a UAP hunt,\n\n1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:07.800\n and see if we can't find any things\n\n1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:09.040\n or take a look at them.\n\n1:35:09.040 --> 1:35:10.440\n I don't know if it was ingest or not,\n\n1:35:10.440 --> 1:35:14.280\n but I actually would say it's not ingest\n\n1:35:14.280 --> 1:35:16.800\n because there were notices that were being briefed\n\n1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:18.880\n about this being a safety hazard at this point.\n\n1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:23.080\n And so now that I think about it, it likely wasn't ingest.\n\n1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:24.560\n Long story short, they went flying.\n\n1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:25.880\n The weather was too bad.\n\n1:35:25.880 --> 1:35:28.880\n They did go on a UFO hunt and they physically saw one.\n\n1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:30.160\n And he called me up and said,\n\n1:35:30.160 --> 1:35:31.520\n hey, sir, I saw a Cuban sphere.\n\n1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:33.400\n They're still out here years later.\n\n1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.720\n And so it's almost like a generational issue\n\n1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:37.960\n for these fighter pilots, at least on East Coast.\n\n1:35:37.960 --> 1:35:39.840\n But that's great that they can talk about it, right?\n\n1:35:39.840 --> 1:35:41.040\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:42.160\n They feel at least comfortable.\n\n1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:43.840\n They have a reporting mechanism.\n\n1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.040\n And so that was one of the problems that I noticed\n\n1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:48.640\n that we have a lot of reporting mechanisms\n\n1:35:48.640 --> 1:35:52.880\n to take care of safety issues and even tactical issues\n\n1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:54.680\n when the time's right in order to keep track\n\n1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:55.800\n of what's going on,\n\n1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:58.360\n but there's no way to communicate about this.\n\n1:35:59.360 --> 1:36:00.840\n Sure, we could submit a hazard report,\n\n1:36:00.840 --> 1:36:03.280\n but nothing's actually being investigated\n\n1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:07.200\n and if this is a tactical vulnerability or something more,\n\n1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:09.040\n it deserves attention.\n\n1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:13.720\n If I could ask your sort of take your opinion\n\n1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:17.280\n of the different UFO sightings\n\n1:36:17.280 --> 1:36:19.640\n that the DOD has released videos on.\n\n1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:22.620\n So what do you think about the Tic Tac UFO\n\n1:36:22.620 --> 1:36:26.000\n that David Fravor and others have sighted?\n\n1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.800\n That's a truly anomalous experience.\n\n1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:33.800\n I can't do like mental models in my head\n\n1:36:35.380 --> 1:36:39.620\n to find potential solutions to discredit that, right?\n\n1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:40.820\n Like as much as I try, right?\n\n1:36:40.820 --> 1:36:42.640\n Just as a logical process, as a practice,\n\n1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:45.220\n I can't pick it apart in the way\n\n1:36:45.220 --> 1:36:46.500\n that we were just talking about a moment ago\n\n1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:49.300\n about thousands of drones being like sent up\n\n1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:50.380\n in very tricky manners, right?\n\n1:36:50.380 --> 1:36:53.580\n I can't really bring myself to a clever solution\n\n1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:56.340\n that other than just saying the pilots are lying\n\n1:36:56.340 --> 1:36:57.980\n or it was error, you know?\n\n1:36:57.980 --> 1:37:00.740\n And I believe, you know, I know Dave Fravor,\n\n1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:02.900\n you know, I consider him a friend, we talk a lot.\n\n1:37:02.900 --> 1:37:07.000\n I have zero, zero reason to disbelieve anything he says.\n\n1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:13.220\n Yeah, I agree with you, but in terms of the actual UFO,\n\n1:37:15.860 --> 1:37:18.460\n is there something anomalous and interesting to you\n\n1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:19.960\n about that particular case?\n\n1:37:19.960 --> 1:37:24.740\n Maybe one interesting aspect there is how much\n\n1:37:24.740 --> 1:37:28.340\n do I understand about the water surface\n\n1:37:28.340 --> 1:37:30.540\n and underwater aspects of these UFOs?\n\n1:37:30.540 --> 1:37:32.380\n It seems like a lot of the discussions\n\n1:37:32.380 --> 1:37:36.200\n is about the movement of this particular thing\n\n1:37:36.200 --> 1:37:40.380\n that seems to be weird, anomalous, seems to defy physics,\n\n1:37:40.380 --> 1:37:42.140\n but what about stuff that's happening underwater?\n\n1:37:42.140 --> 1:37:43.800\n That's interesting to me.\n\n1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:47.380\n If I had advanced technology, I would certainly\n\n1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:49.460\n like to operate in part underwater\n\n1:37:49.460 --> 1:37:51.660\n because you can hide a lot of stuff there.\n\n1:37:51.660 --> 1:37:53.620\n You think it would be somewhat as easy\n\n1:37:53.620 --> 1:37:56.100\n as traveling through interstellar space, at least, right?\n\n1:37:56.100 --> 1:37:56.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:56.940 --> 1:38:00.100\n You know, I wish I had a great answer for that,\n\n1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:04.900\n but as an aviator, that's kind of a black box for us.\n\n1:38:04.900 --> 1:38:06.820\n We don't have great, what I would call\n\n1:38:06.820 --> 1:38:08.220\n cross domain tracking, right?\n\n1:38:08.220 --> 1:38:09.860\n I can't see something go underwater\n\n1:38:09.860 --> 1:38:11.420\n and then follow it underwater.\n\n1:38:11.420 --> 1:38:12.900\n So it's literally not your domain,\n\n1:38:12.900 --> 1:38:15.500\n like underwater, like leave that for somebody else.\n\n1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:17.540\n Yeah, and you know, I use that terminology\n\n1:38:17.540 --> 1:38:20.020\n because it's kind of important, right?\n\n1:38:20.020 --> 1:38:22.720\n Cross domain tracking is something that we haven't had\n\n1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:23.740\n to necessarily worry about, right?\n\n1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:25.840\n Because airplanes operated in the air\n\n1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:28.380\n and submarines operated underwater\n\n1:38:28.380 --> 1:38:30.340\n and space planes operate in space, right?\n\n1:38:30.340 --> 1:38:33.180\n But you know, there's going to be, you know,\n\n1:38:33.180 --> 1:38:35.820\n that's going to blur, I think, as we move along here,\n\n1:38:35.820 --> 1:38:38.300\n especially in the air and space regime\n\n1:38:38.300 --> 1:38:41.820\n and being able to perhaps transition my radar contact\n\n1:38:41.820 --> 1:38:44.740\n at 40,000 feet to another radar system\n\n1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:47.680\n that can track it up to 200,000 feet,\n\n1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:48.820\n you know, that might be a value.\n\n1:38:48.820 --> 1:38:51.320\n And so we seem to be missing that right now.\n\n1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:53.740\n So what about the go fast and the gimbal videos\n\n1:38:53.740 --> 1:38:54.700\n that you mentioned earlier?\n\n1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:57.900\n There was a, like, what's interesting there to you?\n\n1:38:58.740 --> 1:39:01.120\n So the gimbal, I'll talk about that one first.\n\n1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:02.820\n I was airborne for that one.\n\n1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:05.980\n The person that recorded it was a good friend of mine,\n\n1:39:05.980 --> 1:39:07.540\n but I mean, both air crew, I knew both of them,\n\n1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:10.140\n but the wizard himself, very close friends,\n\n1:39:10.140 --> 1:39:12.060\n went through a lot of her training together.\n\n1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:14.580\n We went to the same fleet squadron.\n\n1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:16.780\n He ended up transitioning to be a pilot\n\n1:39:16.780 --> 1:39:19.460\n and then came to where I was instructing.\n\n1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:21.980\n So I got to instruct him a bit on his transition.\n\n1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:25.740\n And, you know, the way that was,\n\n1:39:25.740 --> 1:39:28.900\n was we went out on a air to air training mission.\n\n1:39:28.900 --> 1:39:33.080\n So simulating a air fight against our own guys,\n\n1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:34.260\n they're acting like the bad guys\n\n1:39:34.260 --> 1:39:36.660\n and kind of go head to head against each other.\n\n1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:37.960\n And when we fly on those missions,\n\n1:39:37.960 --> 1:39:40.500\n we all fly out together, more or less,\n\n1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:43.300\n we set up and then we kind of attrite from the fight\n\n1:39:43.300 --> 1:39:46.060\n as we either, you know, run out of gas or something happens.\n\n1:39:46.060 --> 1:39:49.060\n And so people usually go back onesies or twosies.\n\n1:39:49.060 --> 1:39:51.700\n And so the air crew that recorded the gimbal,\n\n1:39:51.700 --> 1:39:52.980\n they were going back to the boat\n\n1:39:52.980 --> 1:39:55.380\n and we were on what's called a workup training event.\n\n1:39:55.380 --> 1:39:57.700\n And so this is like a month on the boat\n\n1:39:57.700 --> 1:40:00.640\n where we're essentially conducting war time operations,\n\n1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:03.420\n more or less, to stress ourselves out\n\n1:40:03.420 --> 1:40:06.260\n and to kind of do the last training block\n\n1:40:06.260 --> 1:40:07.540\n before we go on deployment, essentially.\n\n1:40:07.540 --> 1:40:09.340\n So it's pretty high stress.\n\n1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:12.780\n They actually do send aircraft from like land bases\n\n1:40:12.780 --> 1:40:14.400\n to kind of try to penetrate\n\n1:40:14.400 --> 1:40:15.980\n and we're expected to go intercept them.\n\n1:40:15.980 --> 1:40:18.580\n And so we're kind of practicing like we play.\n\n1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:21.680\n And so he saw these objects on the radar,\n\n1:40:23.020 --> 1:40:27.240\n the gimbal and a fleet of other aircraft or vehicles.\n\n1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:29.540\n And they initially thought it was part\n\n1:40:29.540 --> 1:40:31.860\n of the training exercise that they were sending something\n\n1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:35.140\n in to try to penetrate the airspace.\n\n1:40:35.140 --> 1:40:37.220\n And so they, you know, they flew over to it\n\n1:40:37.220 --> 1:40:40.260\n and as they got close enough to get on the FLIR,\n\n1:40:40.260 --> 1:40:43.140\n you know, I think everyone has heard their reaction\n\n1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:44.540\n and they realized that it wasn't something\n\n1:40:44.540 --> 1:40:46.140\n they were expecting to see.\n\n1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:47.540\n Can you actually describe what's in the video\n\n1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:49.940\n and what's the reaction in case they haven't seen it?\n\n1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:51.540\n Yeah, a lot of swearing.\n\n1:40:51.540 --> 1:40:53.500\n But so what you see on the FLIR footage\n\n1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:57.180\n is a black or white, depending on when you look at it,\n\n1:40:57.180 --> 1:40:59.420\n object that's somewhat shaped like a gimbal.\n\n1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:02.660\n It appears almost as if someone put two plates together\n\n1:41:02.660 --> 1:41:05.820\n and then there seems to be almost like a small funnel\n\n1:41:05.820 --> 1:41:08.260\n of IR energy that's at the top of the bottom\n\n1:41:08.260 --> 1:41:09.620\n of those plates in a sense.\n\n1:41:09.620 --> 1:41:12.420\n So almost as if, you know, there's a stick going in\n\n1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:14.580\n between two plates, but not that pronounced, right?\n\n1:41:14.580 --> 1:41:16.860\n So there's an energy field that kind of went to a funnel\n\n1:41:16.860 --> 1:41:17.700\n on the top and the bottom,\n\n1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:20.300\n at least that's how it's being portrayed on the FLIR.\n\n1:41:21.260 --> 1:41:23.260\n There's a lot of conversation about that being glare,\n\n1:41:23.260 --> 1:41:24.100\n things of that nature,\n\n1:41:24.100 --> 1:41:26.500\n but it was actually a very tight IR image.\n\n1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:30.420\n It just was nondescript shape, which was interesting.\n\n1:41:30.420 --> 1:41:32.820\n Typically we would see the skin of the aircraft,\n\n1:41:32.820 --> 1:41:35.020\n we can see the flames coming out of the exhaust,\n\n1:41:35.020 --> 1:41:36.420\n especially at those ranges.\n\n1:41:37.340 --> 1:41:38.180\n But...\n\n1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:39.980\n And there was no flames or there's no exhaust here.\n\n1:41:39.980 --> 1:41:42.540\n There was no exhaust, there was no, you know,\n\n1:41:42.540 --> 1:41:45.580\n there was no outgassing of repellent in any manner, right?\n\n1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:48.420\n It was just an object that had nothing emitting from it\n\n1:41:48.420 --> 1:41:49.900\n that was stationary in the sky.\n\n1:41:49.900 --> 1:41:53.780\n Well, not stationary, but it was moving along a path, right?\n\n1:41:53.780 --> 1:41:55.980\n It wasn't falling out of the sky.\n\n1:41:55.980 --> 1:41:58.020\n And it continued along, if we were to consider it\n\n1:41:58.020 --> 1:42:01.020\n from a God's eye view, again, on the SA page,\n\n1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:02.860\n it continued along in a path.\n\n1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:05.820\n And from the perspective, that top down view,\n\n1:42:05.820 --> 1:42:07.180\n it just went in another direction.\n\n1:42:07.180 --> 1:42:10.820\n So no, just an instantaneous direction change\n\n1:42:10.820 --> 1:42:12.020\n from that perspective.\n\n1:42:13.100 --> 1:42:15.300\n You also hear them, you know, very excitedly talking\n\n1:42:15.300 --> 1:42:18.980\n on the tapes about, you know, whatever the heck this thing is\n\n1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:21.980\n and look at the SA, there's a whole formation of them.\n\n1:42:22.820 --> 1:42:25.860\n And so the SA is a situational awareness page.\n\n1:42:25.860 --> 1:42:27.460\n And again, it's a large display that gives\n\n1:42:27.460 --> 1:42:29.900\n that God's eye view of all the radar contacts.\n\n1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:32.460\n So the video is actually showing just one\n\n1:42:32.460 --> 1:42:35.980\n and then they're speaking about many of them\n\n1:42:35.980 --> 1:42:38.020\n on the SA display.\n\n1:42:38.020 --> 1:42:38.860\n Correct.\n\n1:42:38.860 --> 1:42:40.580\n And what they essentially saw was,\n\n1:42:40.580 --> 1:42:42.900\n if we were to consider above the object north,\n\n1:42:42.900 --> 1:42:46.380\n so kind of offset to the north of the object,\n\n1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:47.900\n there was a formation of about somewhere\n\n1:42:47.900 --> 1:42:49.940\n between four and six of these objects\n\n1:42:49.940 --> 1:42:51.660\n in a rough wedge formation, you know,\n\n1:42:51.660 --> 1:42:54.500\n so kind of side by side like this.\n\n1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:57.420\n And again, not in a like autopilot type manner\n\n1:42:57.420 --> 1:42:58.300\n where it was very stiff.\n\n1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:00.660\n It was very kind of non mechanical,\n\n1:43:00.660 --> 1:43:02.660\n the flight mechanics again.\n\n1:43:02.660 --> 1:43:04.460\n And these objects were in that formation\n\n1:43:04.460 --> 1:43:06.940\n and they were going along and then they turned\n\n1:43:06.940 --> 1:43:09.660\n pretty sharply, but they still had a radius of turn\n\n1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:11.540\n and then went back in the opposite direction.\n\n1:43:11.540 --> 1:43:13.780\n And during that turn, they were kind of like\n\n1:43:13.780 --> 1:43:14.620\n all over the place.\n\n1:43:14.620 --> 1:43:15.620\n Like it wasn't tight.\n\n1:43:15.620 --> 1:43:17.300\n They weren't even like super,\n\n1:43:17.300 --> 1:43:18.940\n they weren't flying in a way I would expect them\n\n1:43:18.940 --> 1:43:20.860\n to be flying in relation to a flight lead.\n\n1:43:20.860 --> 1:43:23.020\n They were flying as if they were flying close\n\n1:43:23.020 --> 1:43:24.420\n to each other, but not in formation,\n\n1:43:24.420 --> 1:43:26.060\n which was kind of strange, right?\n\n1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:28.140\n And then when they rolled out,\n\n1:43:28.140 --> 1:43:29.300\n they kind of tightened back up.\n\n1:43:29.300 --> 1:43:30.740\n Like, so when they basically,\n\n1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:32.900\n they started that turn and then 180 degrees out,\n\n1:43:32.900 --> 1:43:35.540\n essentially they start flowing in the opposite direction\n\n1:43:35.540 --> 1:43:37.460\n and kind of got back in that formation.\n\n1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:38.820\n And while that was happening,\n\n1:43:38.820 --> 1:43:41.780\n the gimbal object was proceeding, let's say left to right.\n\n1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:45.860\n And as those, the formation kind of turned up to the north\n\n1:43:45.860 --> 1:43:47.340\n and was just passing back it,\n\n1:43:47.340 --> 1:43:49.820\n the gimbal just kind of went back in the opposite direction.\n\n1:43:49.820 --> 1:43:52.060\n So to follow it back in that direction.\n\n1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:57.220\n And in the FLIR itself, you see the object\n\n1:43:57.220 --> 1:43:58.940\n changes orientation quite a bit.\n\n1:43:58.940 --> 1:44:01.380\n So you see it more or less level,\n\n1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:03.500\n maybe candid about 45 degrees.\n\n1:44:03.500 --> 1:44:06.300\n And then you see it kind of moving around like this,\n\n1:44:06.300 --> 1:44:08.860\n almost as if it was a gimbal.\n\n1:44:08.860 --> 1:44:11.980\n I've come to learn after some,\n\n1:44:11.980 --> 1:44:13.620\n having seen some research online\n\n1:44:13.620 --> 1:44:15.860\n and people really looking into this,\n\n1:44:15.860 --> 1:44:19.020\n that it seemed that the object actually climbed\n\n1:44:19.020 --> 1:44:19.980\n during that maneuver.\n\n1:44:19.980 --> 1:44:23.180\n And so the reason it looked like it turned immediately\n\n1:44:23.180 --> 1:44:24.500\n is because it turned like this.\n\n1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:26.700\n It turned in a vertical fashion like that,\n\n1:44:26.700 --> 1:44:28.340\n which is pretty interesting.\n\n1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:31.740\n That's kind of like another example of a flight mechanics\n\n1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:33.300\n that we don't normally operate\n\n1:44:33.300 --> 1:44:36.020\n because we don't change our directions\n\n1:44:36.020 --> 1:44:37.860\n by maneuvering in the vertical.\n\n1:44:37.860 --> 1:44:41.580\n If we can help it, you're just killing the fuel.\n\n1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:44.780\n And so if you're like a surveillance platform\n\n1:44:44.780 --> 1:44:46.620\n looking to spend as much time around something,\n\n1:44:46.620 --> 1:44:51.260\n you're not gonna climb 500 feet every time you make a turn.\n\n1:44:51.260 --> 1:44:53.460\n Unless you're Tom Cruise.\n\n1:44:53.460 --> 1:44:54.980\n Unless you're Tom Cruise, naturally.\n\n1:44:54.980 --> 1:44:57.060\n Okay, so is that one of the more impressive\n\n1:44:57.060 --> 1:45:00.380\n flight mechanics you've seen in video forms\n\n1:45:00.380 --> 1:45:03.020\n or not the direct eyesight reports,\n\n1:45:03.020 --> 1:45:05.620\n but like in terms of video evidence that we have?\n\n1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:06.820\n I think so.\n\n1:45:06.820 --> 1:45:08.580\n We were seeing a lot of these,\n\n1:45:08.580 --> 1:45:10.820\n but we weren't just going on recording them all day.\n\n1:45:10.820 --> 1:45:13.020\n We just kind of put them in that safety bucket,\n\n1:45:13.020 --> 1:45:14.300\n be like, all right, there's objects over there.\n\n1:45:14.300 --> 1:45:16.220\n We're just not gonna go near it.\n\n1:45:16.220 --> 1:45:19.020\n And so we weren't putting our sensors on them that much.\n\n1:45:19.020 --> 1:45:21.380\n We were gathering the data kind of secondarily,\n\n1:45:21.380 --> 1:45:23.300\n but we weren't primarily focusing on it\n\n1:45:23.300 --> 1:45:24.780\n to see all the details.\n\n1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:27.420\n That's so fascinating because you have a busy day.\n\n1:45:27.420 --> 1:45:28.940\n You have a lot to do.\n\n1:45:28.940 --> 1:45:31.340\n All right, well, there's some weird stuff going on there.\n\n1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:32.700\n We're just not gonna go there.\n\n1:45:32.700 --> 1:45:37.540\n And that says something about human nature,\n\n1:45:37.540 --> 1:45:40.380\n about the way that bureaucracies function,\n\n1:45:40.380 --> 1:45:41.940\n the way the military functions.\n\n1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:44.820\n It fills up your day with busy, important things,\n\n1:45:44.820 --> 1:45:48.020\n and you don't get to, I mean, that is something\n\n1:45:48.020 --> 1:45:52.180\n that I'm in a sort of absurd way worry about,\n\n1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:56.820\n which is like we fill our days with so much busyness\n\n1:45:56.820 --> 1:45:59.580\n than when truly beautiful things happen,\n\n1:45:59.580 --> 1:46:01.820\n whatever they are, truly anomalous things.\n\n1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:04.100\n We just won't pay attention\n\n1:46:04.100 --> 1:46:07.740\n because they don't fit our busy schedule.\n\n1:46:07.740 --> 1:46:10.300\n Beautiful, I think that's right on the nose.\n\n1:46:10.300 --> 1:46:13.700\n And it's on my nose because I didn't give this topic\n\n1:46:13.700 --> 1:46:16.300\n the attention it deserved until I left, right?\n\n1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:19.460\n Until I left and I went to be an instructor pilot\n\n1:46:19.460 --> 1:46:21.780\n where I had more time.\n\n1:46:21.780 --> 1:46:24.820\n I had more downtime to kind of process and think\n\n1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:27.460\n and get out of exactly what you just described.\n\n1:46:27.460 --> 1:46:29.340\n And that's kind of what broke me out of it\n\n1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:31.340\n and got me thinking more about it.\n\n1:46:31.340 --> 1:46:33.740\n Why do you think the DOD released these videos?\n\n1:46:34.620 --> 1:46:36.060\n It's a great question.\n\n1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:38.300\n Did the DOD release it or did they kind of get out\n\n1:46:38.300 --> 1:46:39.540\n on their own in some sense?\n\n1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:41.180\n So I don't know the answer to that question,\n\n1:46:41.180 --> 1:46:42.900\n but my understanding of the situation\n\n1:46:42.900 --> 1:46:45.820\n is that the DOD talked about them so much\n\n1:46:45.820 --> 1:46:47.740\n because they were already out there in a sense.\n\n1:46:47.740 --> 1:46:50.540\n And so they had a choice where they could have\n\n1:46:50.540 --> 1:46:52.940\n just straight up lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was fake.\n\n1:46:52.940 --> 1:46:56.260\n But again, I think our culture now is too open\n\n1:46:56.260 --> 1:46:59.580\n and the information moves too freely to do things like that.\n\n1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:00.740\n And it kind of left them in a pickle\n\n1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:02.700\n that they had to respond to.\n\n1:47:02.700 --> 1:47:05.460\n So what was the role of Pentagon's\n\n1:47:05.460 --> 1:47:09.180\n Advanced Aerospace Threat Intelligence Program, AATIP?\n\n1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:11.220\n From your perspective, from what you know,\n\n1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:14.940\n maybe your intuition, is AATIP a real thing that existed?\n\n1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:16.780\n I was in a position as an aviator\n\n1:47:16.780 --> 1:47:20.120\n that never would have exposed me to anything like that.\n\n1:47:20.120 --> 1:47:22.460\n But I was curious about what people knew.\n\n1:47:22.460 --> 1:47:26.100\n And I think in my mind, maybe you hoped or,\n\n1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:27.840\n hope someone was looking into this in some sense.\n\n1:47:27.840 --> 1:47:30.980\n But on the day that Gimbal was recorded,\n\n1:47:30.980 --> 1:47:34.100\n I heard that they caught something extra interesting\n\n1:47:34.100 --> 1:47:38.220\n on the FLIR, and I went to the Intel debrief space\n\n1:47:40.340 --> 1:47:41.700\n to go see the film.\n\n1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:43.540\n And everyone's gathered around watching it,\n\n1:47:43.540 --> 1:47:45.980\n very interesting, and I heard the admiral was coming down.\n\n1:47:45.980 --> 1:47:48.260\n And so I was like, I'm gonna hang out back quietly,\n\n1:47:48.260 --> 1:47:50.500\n mind my own business, and just wanna see his reaction,\n\n1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:52.660\n try to read it to see if this is brand new\n\n1:47:52.660 --> 1:47:55.660\n or if it is something that they've been dealing with.\n\n1:47:55.660 --> 1:47:57.780\n And you know, he came in and he watched a video\n\n1:47:57.780 --> 1:47:58.980\n for like five or six seconds,\n\n1:47:58.980 --> 1:48:01.220\n and he went, mm, and then like turned around and walked out.\n\n1:48:01.220 --> 1:48:02.340\n And you know, I was like,\n\n1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:04.360\n he's definitely seen these before.\n\n1:48:04.360 --> 1:48:06.340\n There's no way that you only watch that for a few seconds\n\n1:48:06.340 --> 1:48:08.220\n and don't have more interest.\n\n1:48:08.220 --> 1:48:09.920\n It was, you know, too bizarre.\n\n1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:12.960\n So kind of going back, does the office exist?\n\n1:48:12.960 --> 1:48:17.260\n Well, you know, I've heard that the admiral essentially\n\n1:48:18.340 --> 1:48:22.700\n reported back to the Pentagon about that case real time,\n\n1:48:22.700 --> 1:48:23.960\n essentially, after he left, right?\n\n1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:26.500\n So he basically went back and I was told he reported that\n\n1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:29.420\n to either ATEP directly or to other, you know,\n\n1:48:29.420 --> 1:48:30.680\n somehow the information got there.\n\n1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:33.920\n So from my perspective and from what I've experienced,\n\n1:48:34.780 --> 1:48:36.780\n it seems like, yes, it was a thing.\n\n1:48:36.780 --> 1:48:38.900\n But you know, as an aviator,\n\n1:48:38.900 --> 1:48:40.420\n I wouldn't know either way, right?\n\n1:48:40.420 --> 1:48:41.900\n That's just my experience from what happened.\n\n1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:45.540\n But it seems like there's somewhere to report to.\n\n1:48:46.820 --> 1:48:48.520\n At the time, it seemed like there was at least someplace\n\n1:48:48.520 --> 1:48:50.540\n to complain to, if not report to.\n\n1:48:50.540 --> 1:48:54.900\n Let me ask you about sort of people that are taking\n\n1:48:54.900 --> 1:48:56.620\n a serious look at the videos\n\n1:48:56.620 --> 1:48:59.900\n and just the different UFO sighting reports.\n\n1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:03.840\n So there's a person named Meg West who is a skeptic\n\n1:49:03.840 --> 1:49:05.500\n and tries to take a skeptical view\n\n1:49:05.500 --> 1:49:08.980\n on every single piece of evidence on these UFO sightings.\n\n1:49:08.980 --> 1:49:11.060\n What do you think about his analysis?\n\n1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:14.660\n He tries to analyze in a way that debunks some of these\n\n1:49:14.660 --> 1:49:18.580\n videos and assign probabilities to their explanations,\n\n1:49:18.580 --> 1:49:23.580\n sort of leaning towards things that give a very low\n\n1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:29.180\n probability to alien extraterrestrial type of explanations\n\n1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:31.300\n for these UFOs.\n\n1:49:31.300 --> 1:49:35.580\n What do you think about his approach to these analysis?\n\n1:49:35.580 --> 1:49:37.300\n Well, two parts to his approach.\n\n1:49:37.300 --> 1:49:39.420\n One, I commend him for all the good work\n\n1:49:39.420 --> 1:49:41.220\n and effort he put into it.\n\n1:49:41.220 --> 1:49:44.060\n I've seen him build some models and things of that nature.\n\n1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:46.940\n And so I think that's something that's absolutely needed\n\n1:49:46.940 --> 1:49:47.780\n in this environment.\n\n1:49:47.780 --> 1:49:50.600\n No one's asking anyone to believe anyone here, right?\n\n1:49:51.540 --> 1:49:55.140\n Trust but verify should certainly be the mantra.\n\n1:49:55.140 --> 1:49:58.260\n But where I have a disagreement with his approach\n\n1:49:58.260 --> 1:50:02.780\n is that he's approaching from a debunker standpoint.\n\n1:50:02.780 --> 1:50:06.180\n And from my perspective, not speaking for everyone,\n\n1:50:06.180 --> 1:50:09.980\n but when I hear that, that tells me that you're driving\n\n1:50:09.980 --> 1:50:12.340\n towards a particular conclusion,\n\n1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:16.980\n which has been a very safe process for the past X years.\n\n1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:19.420\n It's been like a very safe business to be in\n\n1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:21.420\n to tell people that they haven't seen aliens,\n\n1:50:21.420 --> 1:50:23.940\n but times have changed a little bit.\n\n1:50:23.940 --> 1:50:28.940\n And the tactics I've seen to try to retain that\n\n1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:34.580\n view on reality has included things such as\n\n1:50:34.580 --> 1:50:36.780\n completely dismissing what the aircrew are saying.\n\n1:50:36.780 --> 1:50:39.980\n And I think that is a fallacy to think that\n\n1:50:39.980 --> 1:50:42.820\n we have to take the human outside of that analysis.\n\n1:50:42.820 --> 1:50:45.460\n So those are the two things I disagree with.\n\n1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:48.700\n When you put the night vision on and you look at the stars\n\n1:50:48.700 --> 1:50:51.500\n and you look out there in the vast cosmos,\n\n1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:53.660\n only a small fraction of which we can see,\n\n1:50:55.540 --> 1:50:57.540\n how many intelligent alien civilizations\n\n1:50:57.540 --> 1:50:58.860\n do you think are out there?\n\n1:50:58.860 --> 1:51:00.220\n Do you think about this kind of stuff?\n\n1:51:00.220 --> 1:51:01.620\n I do.\n\n1:51:01.620 --> 1:51:03.280\n You know, I'm of the theory that we are not\n\n1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:04.120\n the only people out there.\n\n1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:06.920\n I think it would be a statistically silly comment\n\n1:51:06.920 --> 1:51:09.260\n to assume we are, although I get that we are\n\n1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:11.140\n the only data point that we currently have.\n\n1:51:11.140 --> 1:51:13.840\n Although I'm willing to jump over that fence\n\n1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:15.980\n and say that yes, there most likely is\n\n1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:18.140\n intelligent life elsewhere.\n\n1:51:18.140 --> 1:51:19.940\n Although I'll concede that it is a possibility\n\n1:51:19.940 --> 1:51:21.960\n we are early or it could be limited\n\n1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:25.480\n or it could be in a manner that we don't recognize\n\n1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:27.100\n or can really understand.\n\n1:51:27.100 --> 1:51:30.140\n I spend so much time thinking about\n\n1:51:30.140 --> 1:51:34.060\n how we anthropomorphize things on this UFO topic.\n\n1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:36.300\n And we've done it to ourselves with media in a sense.\n\n1:51:36.300 --> 1:51:38.660\n We've trained ourselves what to think about,\n\n1:51:38.660 --> 1:51:41.860\n what we think is true or what this would be like.\n\n1:51:41.860 --> 1:51:44.780\n And by doing so, I think we're closing ourselves off\n\n1:51:44.780 --> 1:51:47.660\n to a lot of what the possibilities could be\n\n1:51:47.660 --> 1:51:49.360\n and the things that we could miss.\n\n1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:54.540\n You beautifully put that the thing that drew you\n\n1:51:54.540 --> 1:51:57.140\n to fighter jets is the technology.\n\n1:51:57.140 --> 1:52:00.380\n So if you were to think, to imagine\n\n1:52:00.380 --> 1:52:04.820\n from an alien perspective, what kind of technologies\n\n1:52:04.820 --> 1:52:07.580\n would we first encounter as human beings\n\n1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:11.200\n if we were to meet another alien civilization\n\n1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:13.180\n in the next few centuries?\n\n1:52:13.180 --> 1:52:15.840\n What kind of thing would we see?\n\n1:52:15.840 --> 1:52:17.540\n So you're now at the cutting edge\n\n1:52:17.540 --> 1:52:20.100\n and you see the quick progress that's happening.\n\n1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:21.900\n That was happening throughout the 20th century,\n\n1:52:21.900 --> 1:52:24.740\n that's happening now with greater degrees of autonomy\n\n1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:26.540\n with robots and that kind of stuff.\n\n1:52:26.540 --> 1:52:28.940\n What do you think we will encounter?\n\n1:52:28.940 --> 1:52:32.620\n I think we're gonna see the ability to manipulate matter\n\n1:52:32.620 --> 1:52:34.620\n like we used to manipulate information.\n\n1:52:34.620 --> 1:52:38.080\n Like I think that's what, whether that means\n\n1:52:38.080 --> 1:52:40.380\n being able to pop something on the table\n\n1:52:40.380 --> 1:52:44.940\n that didn't exist or to influence a chemical reaction\n\n1:52:44.940 --> 1:52:47.200\n somewhere, but being able to manipulate\n\n1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:51.060\n and treat matter as if it was information.\n\n1:52:51.060 --> 1:52:53.740\n And so being able to design specific materials,\n\n1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:57.580\n being able to move past a lot of the barriers\n\n1:52:57.580 --> 1:52:59.660\n that seem to limit our progress with things\n\n1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:03.080\n such as miniaturized fusion or even just fusion in general\n\n1:53:03.080 --> 1:53:07.060\n is a lot of it is matter based, is material based\n\n1:53:07.060 --> 1:53:11.020\n and our ability to not manipulate,\n\n1:53:11.020 --> 1:53:13.460\n we can only discover materials in a sense.\n\n1:53:13.460 --> 1:53:15.540\n And so I think that a complete mastery\n\n1:53:15.540 --> 1:53:18.540\n of physical reality would be one of the key traits\n\n1:53:18.540 --> 1:53:21.140\n of a very intelligent species.\n\n1:53:21.140 --> 1:53:22.960\n Well, you're actually working on some,\n\n1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:23.940\n maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:53:23.940 --> 1:53:26.020\n but sort of quantum mechanical simulation\n\n1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:28.000\n to understand materials.\n\n1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:31.260\n So is that, do you see sort of the early steps\n\n1:53:31.260 --> 1:53:33.780\n that we're doing at quantum computing side\n\n1:53:33.780 --> 1:53:37.180\n to start to simulate, to deeper understand materials,\n\n1:53:37.180 --> 1:53:39.820\n but maybe to engineer and to mess with materials\n\n1:53:39.820 --> 1:53:43.460\n at the very low level that aliens will be able to do\n\n1:53:43.460 --> 1:53:46.500\n and hopefully humans will be able to do soon?\n\n1:53:46.500 --> 1:53:48.300\n Yeah, I think that's, you know,\n\n1:53:48.300 --> 1:53:52.260\n so if we think about how, what materials are made of,\n\n1:53:52.260 --> 1:53:53.860\n it's just a collection of atoms,\n\n1:53:53.860 --> 1:53:55.580\n but each one of those atoms has a lot of data\n\n1:53:55.580 --> 1:53:56.420\n associated with it.\n\n1:53:56.420 --> 1:53:57.840\n So if we wanna kind of calculate\n\n1:53:57.840 --> 1:53:59.900\n how they interact with each other,\n\n1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:02.460\n it requires a massive amount of computational resources,\n\n1:54:02.460 --> 1:54:04.620\n so much so that it can't be done in a lot of cases\n\n1:54:04.620 --> 1:54:06.140\n with classical computers.\n\n1:54:06.140 --> 1:54:09.100\n And that's where quantum computers come in.\n\n1:54:09.100 --> 1:54:10.860\n Although we don't have a perfectly functioning\n\n1:54:10.860 --> 1:54:13.100\n quantum computer at this point,\n\n1:54:13.100 --> 1:54:14.620\n one of the things that we're working at\n\n1:54:14.620 --> 1:54:16.740\n at quantum general materials is to essentially\n\n1:54:16.740 --> 1:54:19.620\n bridge that gap between what a classical computer can do\n\n1:54:19.620 --> 1:54:21.460\n as far as simulating materials.\n\n1:54:21.460 --> 1:54:23.720\n And of course, what a fully functioning quantum computer\n\n1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:26.380\n would mean for being able to design materials.\n\n1:54:26.380 --> 1:54:29.860\n And so, you know, having the ability to study matter\n\n1:54:29.860 --> 1:54:31.140\n at a very fundamental level\n\n1:54:31.140 --> 1:54:32.940\n and unleashing artificial intelligence\n\n1:54:32.940 --> 1:54:35.500\n to machine learning on that problem,\n\n1:54:35.500 --> 1:54:37.820\n I think is, you know, in a sense, you know,\n\n1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:40.800\n alien in a way that we're able to advance our science\n\n1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.740\n using, you know, a process that we may not fully understand\n\n1:54:43.740 --> 1:54:47.220\n with perhaps a non human based intelligence in some sense.\n\n1:54:47.220 --> 1:54:50.260\n And so we may find patterns in the processes, right?\n\n1:54:50.260 --> 1:54:52.380\n How does our machine learning output, you know,\n\n1:54:52.380 --> 1:54:56.020\n can we match behaviors with what we're observing\n\n1:54:56.020 --> 1:54:58.040\n with what may be a machine learning algorithm with output,\n\n1:54:58.040 --> 1:54:58.880\n right?\n\n1:54:58.880 --> 1:54:59.820\n Can we try to classify the intelligence\n\n1:54:59.820 --> 1:55:01.140\n in that manner, perhaps?\n\n1:55:02.140 --> 1:55:03.380\n And so, you know, at GenMatt,\n\n1:55:03.380 --> 1:55:05.280\n as we're looking at these materials,\n\n1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:06.820\n we're considering what these algorithms\n\n1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:09.120\n could have used for later on.\n\n1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:10.720\n Could we perhaps reverse the process\n\n1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:14.040\n and determine what a unique or anomalous material,\n\n1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:16.760\n what type of properties it potentially could have?\n\n1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:19.440\n And you said GenMatt, right?\n\n1:55:19.440 --> 1:55:20.340\n Mm hmm.\n\n1:55:20.340 --> 1:55:22.580\n What's, what is GenMatt?\n\n1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:24.500\n GenMatt is a quantum general material.\n\n1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:27.080\n So it's the company I work for.\n\n1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:31.680\n We essentially are working on a couple of verticals.\n\n1:55:31.680 --> 1:55:33.940\n One of them is our quantum chemistry work.\n\n1:55:33.940 --> 1:55:35.800\n We're essentially, we're bridging the gap\n\n1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:38.200\n between essentially physics and chemistry.\n\n1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:41.360\n We're working on those problems and again,\n\n1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:43.280\n implementing artificial intelligence machine learning\n\n1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:45.620\n into that process so that we can design those materials\n\n1:55:45.620 --> 1:55:47.040\n from the ground up.\n\n1:55:47.040 --> 1:55:50.520\n Additionally, we are what we consider\n\n1:55:50.520 --> 1:55:52.560\n a vertically integrated material science company,\n\n1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:55.320\n which means we can generate our own data.\n\n1:55:55.320 --> 1:55:59.520\n And so within the next quarter coming up,\n\n1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:02.520\n we are launching a satellite in the space.\n\n1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:05.160\n They'll have a fairly advanced hyperspectral sensor\n\n1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:08.220\n in there, which is intended to be the first launch\n\n1:56:08.220 --> 1:56:11.940\n that will help us detect different types of materials\n\n1:56:11.940 --> 1:56:16.020\n using our advanced knowledge of quantum chemistry, right?\n\n1:56:16.020 --> 1:56:17.440\n We're gonna be leveraging that experience\n\n1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:19.600\n in order to better analyze that data.\n\n1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:20.440\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:25.440\n So materials that are strange or novel out there in space.\n\n1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:28.520\n Not necessarily, but we'll be looking back at Earth\n\n1:56:28.520 --> 1:56:30.880\n to be able to detect mineral deposits on Earth.\n\n1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:31.840\n Got it, got it.\n\n1:56:31.840 --> 1:56:34.360\n Getting the greater perspective from out in space\n\n1:56:34.360 --> 1:56:36.400\n to do analysis of different materials.\n\n1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:37.400\n Interesting.\n\n1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:40.200\n Yeah, I was really impressed by the DeepMind.\n\n1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:41.760\n I got to hang out with DeepMind recently\n\n1:56:41.760 --> 1:56:43.400\n and they really impressed me\n\n1:56:43.400 --> 1:56:45.640\n with the possibility of the application,\n\n1:56:45.640 --> 1:56:47.440\n as you were saying, of machine learning\n\n1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:50.440\n in the context of quantum mechanical simulation\n\n1:56:50.440 --> 1:56:53.500\n for materials, so to understand materials.\n\n1:56:53.500 --> 1:56:56.340\n It's really, really, really interesting.\n\n1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:59.840\n So manipulate matter, huh?\n\n1:56:59.840 --> 1:57:02.240\n I would say the next thing is horses, right?\n\n1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:03.080\n Or maybe fields.\n\n1:57:03.080 --> 1:57:07.560\n So manipulating or managing gravity.\n\n1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:12.280\n Can we maneuver within fields in some manner\n\n1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:16.040\n that allows us to perhaps move propellant less\n\n1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:17.000\n or in other manners, right?\n\n1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:21.200\n And so I think essentially having a deeper understanding\n\n1:57:21.200 --> 1:57:25.160\n of different fields and being able to interact with them,\n\n1:57:25.160 --> 1:57:29.680\n I think would be a potential avenue for travel\n\n1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:31.200\n or advanced travel, right?\n\n1:57:31.200 --> 1:57:32.540\n Propellant less travel.\n\n1:57:33.420 --> 1:57:36.280\n Can we quantum entangle gravity fields together\n\n1:57:36.280 --> 1:57:39.120\n and propel a ship by the gravity field of a planet,\n\n1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:41.400\n the mass of a planet, and a drive on a ship?\n\n1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:44.600\n You know, there's all sorts of interesting things, but.\n\n1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:46.840\n Yeah, people will look back at people like you\n\n1:57:46.840 --> 1:57:49.360\n and say, well, they used to fly,\n\n1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:51.320\n like with this kind of propellant,\n\n1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:54.160\n it seems like to be a very antiquated way of flying,\n\n1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:55.760\n and they were very impressed with themselves,\n\n1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:58.620\n these humans, that they could fly like birds.\n\n1:57:58.620 --> 1:58:02.880\n It's like so much energy is used to fly\n\n1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:05.200\n such short distances from that perspective.\n\n1:58:05.200 --> 1:58:07.280\n We can only throw so many rocks out the back.\n\n1:58:07.280 --> 1:58:08.360\n There needs to be a better way.\n\n1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:09.200\n Exactly.\n\n1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:10.960\n It just seems dumb, like these.\n\n1:58:12.760 --> 1:58:14.640\n It's like Flintstones or something like that.\n\n1:58:14.640 --> 1:58:16.440\n We're good at it, but there's a limit, right?\n\n1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:18.160\n Like we need to be good.\n\n1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.840\n I mean, that's an interesting sort of trade off.\n\n1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:24.780\n How much do you invest in getting really good at it?\n\n1:58:24.780 --> 1:58:29.780\n I tend to believe the reason why it would be very important\n\n1:58:30.160 --> 1:58:32.120\n and very powerful to put a human on Mars\n\n1:58:32.120 --> 1:58:35.540\n is not necessarily for the exploration facet,\n\n1:58:35.540 --> 1:58:39.380\n but in all the different technologies that come from that.\n\n1:58:39.380 --> 1:58:42.480\n So there's something about putting humans\n\n1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.240\n in extreme conditions where we figure out\n\n1:58:45.240 --> 1:58:48.280\n how to make it less extreme, more comfortable.\n\n1:58:48.280 --> 1:58:51.560\n And for that, we invent things,\n\n1:58:51.560 --> 1:58:55.360\n like the DOD sort of helping invent the internet\n\n1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:58.040\n and all the different technologies we've invented.\n\n1:58:58.040 --> 1:59:00.040\n It's almost like an indirect consequence\n\n1:59:00.040 --> 1:59:01.840\n of solving difficult problems,\n\n1:59:01.840 --> 1:59:05.160\n whether that problem means winning wars\n\n1:59:05.160 --> 1:59:07.320\n or colonizing other planets.\n\n1:59:07.320 --> 1:59:10.460\n And so I don't think Mars will help us figure out\n\n1:59:10.460 --> 1:59:13.520\n propulsion systems or to crack open physics\n\n1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:16.200\n to where you can travel close to the speed of light\n\n1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:17.800\n or faster than the speed of light,\n\n1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:19.800\n but it will help us figure out\n\n1:59:19.800 --> 1:59:23.240\n how to build some cool technology here on Earth, I think.\n\n1:59:23.240 --> 1:59:27.020\n So I'm a big proponent of doing really difficult things,\n\n1:59:27.020 --> 1:59:28.600\n really difficult engineering things\n\n1:59:28.600 --> 1:59:32.680\n to see what kind of technologies emerge from that.\n\n1:59:32.680 --> 1:59:34.800\n But let me ask you this.\n\n1:59:34.800 --> 1:59:39.600\n Do you think US government is hiding some technology\n\n1:59:39.600 --> 1:59:44.340\n like alien spacecraft technology?\n\n1:59:44.340 --> 1:59:47.200\n I have no information either way.\n\n1:59:47.200 --> 1:59:49.080\n And if you did, you probably wouldn't tell me.\n\n1:59:49.080 --> 1:59:52.640\n But my assumptions, like what did my heart tell me?\n\n1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:54.760\n My heart tells me something's going on,\n\n1:59:54.760 --> 1:59:56.700\n but I have no evidence for that.\n\n1:59:56.700 --> 1:59:58.600\n Maybe that's me wanting something to go on.\n\n1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:01.640\n Maybe that's a human feeling to want to know\n\n2:00:01.640 --> 2:00:03.000\n that my government's in control\n\n2:00:03.000 --> 2:00:05.340\n of what some strange unknown thing is.\n\n2:00:05.340 --> 2:00:09.700\n What's your sense if such a thing happened?\n\n2:00:09.700 --> 2:00:12.780\n Would this kind of information leak?\n\n2:00:12.780 --> 2:00:15.660\n Would this kind of information be released by the government?\n\n2:00:15.660 --> 2:00:16.940\n I mean, that's the worry that you have\n\n2:00:16.940 --> 2:00:18.820\n is because when you don't understand a thing\n\n2:00:18.820 --> 2:00:20.700\n and it's novel, you want to hide it\n\n2:00:20.700 --> 2:00:25.080\n so that some kind of enemy doesn't get access to it\n\n2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.280\n and use it against you.\n\n2:00:27.220 --> 2:00:29.820\n I wonder if that is the underlying assumption.\n\n2:00:29.820 --> 2:00:31.580\n It's the one people always jump to,\n\n2:00:31.580 --> 2:00:35.220\n that it's for to maintain secrecy of technology.\n\n2:00:35.220 --> 2:00:36.660\n And I assume that's part of it.\n\n2:00:36.660 --> 2:00:38.020\n I wonder if there's any other reasons\n\n2:00:38.020 --> 2:00:40.420\n that we would want to not talk about it.\n\n2:00:40.420 --> 2:00:43.380\n I imagine that such information would have a shock\n\n2:00:43.380 --> 2:00:46.700\n to the social economic system of any country,\n\n2:00:46.700 --> 2:00:48.100\n if not the world.\n\n2:00:48.100 --> 2:00:50.220\n And so I wonder if perhaps that was part\n\n2:00:50.220 --> 2:00:53.760\n of the concern as well, how society can react to it.\n\n2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:56.000\n Maybe we're anti fragile enough now\n\n2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:57.780\n with everything that's going on\n\n2:00:57.780 --> 2:00:59.820\n and with our communication networks that,\n\n2:01:01.900 --> 2:01:02.740\n why not now?\n\n2:01:02.740 --> 2:01:03.560\n I don't know.\n\n2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:06.140\n That's something I think about as well.\n\n2:01:07.140 --> 2:01:12.140\n Yeah, the effect on the mass psyche of something like this,\n\n2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:16.720\n that there's another intelligence out there.\n\n2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:22.100\n We had trouble enough to deal with a pandemic,\n\n2:01:23.420 --> 2:01:25.180\n to have something of this scale,\n\n2:01:27.300 --> 2:01:30.860\n basically having just an inkling of a phenomena\n\n2:01:30.860 --> 2:01:32.500\n that we have no understanding of\n\n2:01:32.500 --> 2:01:34.300\n and could lead to complete destruction\n\n2:01:34.300 --> 2:01:38.000\n of human civilization or a flourishing of it.\n\n2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:39.860\n And what do you do?\n\n2:01:39.860 --> 2:01:42.980\n What does a bureaucracy of government do with that?\n\n2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:45.660\n Especially when they're the ones holding the range of power\n\n2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:48.460\n and such a communication would relinquish that power\n\n2:01:48.460 --> 2:01:50.220\n essentially, to some degree.\n\n2:01:52.300 --> 2:01:55.140\n Since you think there's aliens out there\n\n2:01:55.140 --> 2:02:02.140\n and you're somebody that's thought about war quite a bit,\n\n2:02:02.640 --> 2:02:05.320\n do you think alien civilizations,\n\n2:02:05.320 --> 2:02:07.240\n when we meet them, would want war?\n\n2:02:08.340 --> 2:02:10.560\n Would they be a danger to us?\n\n2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:12.160\n Would they be a friend to us?\n\n2:02:13.200 --> 2:02:16.960\n What's your intuition about intelligences out there?\n\n2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:21.040\n My intuition tells me that when two people like yourself\n\n2:02:21.040 --> 2:02:23.480\n or myself or anyone get together,\n\n2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:26.880\n often the output is greater than the individuals.\n\n2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:28.400\n And when we work together,\n\n2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:31.320\n we can typically do things that are more impressive\n\n2:02:31.320 --> 2:02:33.760\n and better than if a single person works alone.\n\n2:02:35.680 --> 2:02:40.680\n And now I know that war has driven technological progress,\n\n2:02:43.360 --> 2:02:46.320\n but perhaps there's other mechanisms that can do so.\n\n2:02:46.320 --> 2:02:50.360\n But regardless, I wonder if we truly think\n\n2:02:50.360 --> 2:02:53.680\n about an advanced society that has been perhaps thousands\n\n2:02:53.680 --> 2:02:55.920\n or millions of years ahead of us,\n\n2:02:55.920 --> 2:02:59.560\n I would imagine that same truth to be there,\n\n2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:02.720\n that people working together or creatures working together\n\n2:03:02.720 --> 2:03:07.720\n is a good thing for society or its society as a whole.\n\n2:03:07.920 --> 2:03:09.760\n And if we consider that,\n\n2:03:09.760 --> 2:03:14.360\n as we imagine a society growing and expanding,\n\n2:03:14.360 --> 2:03:16.960\n in a sense, the ultimate output of a planet\n\n2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:18.600\n could only be achieved in some senses\n\n2:03:18.600 --> 2:03:21.040\n if everyone was working towards the same goal.\n\n2:03:21.040 --> 2:03:24.720\n And there might be wonders and secrets and things\n\n2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:27.280\n that we can't imagine just simply because of the timeframes\n\n2:03:27.280 --> 2:03:30.280\n that we live under and we think in.\n\n2:03:30.280 --> 2:03:33.520\n But if a planet has a single unit\n\n2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:36.400\n and it almost is as an entity itself at a certain level,\n\n2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:38.720\n if everything's working towards the same output,\n\n2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:40.920\n I could almost imagine an intelligent species\n\n2:03:40.920 --> 2:03:43.320\n that approached us planet to planet\n\n2:03:43.320 --> 2:03:44.720\n instead of person to person,\n\n2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:46.000\n because that's how they've evolved\n\n2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:47.760\n and they've assumed any intelligent species\n\n2:03:47.760 --> 2:03:51.080\n would understand that working together is better than not.\n\n2:03:52.200 --> 2:03:55.480\n And so my heart tells me that at a certain point,\n\n2:03:56.920 --> 2:04:00.280\n love and caring and the desire to work together\n\n2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:03.880\n is much more powerful than the technological progress\n\n2:04:03.880 --> 2:04:04.880\n that war would bring.\n\n2:04:06.040 --> 2:04:08.000\n I hope so as well.\n\n2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:11.120\n Well, let me jump to the AI topic that you've done.\n\n2:04:11.120 --> 2:04:13.080\n So you've done research and development efforts\n\n2:04:13.080 --> 2:04:14.900\n focused on multiagent intelligence\n\n2:04:14.900 --> 2:04:16.880\n for collaborative autonomy,\n\n2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:18.440\n machine learning AI stuff\n\n2:04:18.440 --> 2:04:21.400\n that we've been talking about for combat,\n\n2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:23.080\n for air to air combat,\n\n2:04:23.080 --> 2:04:24.880\n manned, unmanned teaming technologies,\n\n2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:26.440\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:28.480\n What's some interesting ideas in this space\n\n2:04:28.480 --> 2:04:30.240\n that fascinate you?\n\n2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:34.560\n Randomness, being able to not predict\n\n2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:36.840\n what the enemy is doing almost no matter what,\n\n2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:38.120\n because there's a level of randomness\n\n2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:40.720\n that's within the tactical envelope.\n\n2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:42.360\n Even if utility of randomness.\n\n2:04:42.360 --> 2:04:44.880\n The utility of randomness in an increasing.\n\n2:04:44.880 --> 2:04:46.240\n Sounds like a book you should write.\n\n2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:49.240\n That would be a good title.\n\n2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:50.440\n Name my band.\n\n2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:51.520\n Name your band?\n\n2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:52.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:55.320\n So yeah, can you elaborate that?\n\n2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:57.560\n So like trying to deeper understand\n\n2:04:57.560 --> 2:05:02.280\n how you can integrate randomness through AI\n\n2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:03.920\n in the context of combat.\n\n2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:06.160\n In order to make yourself,\n\n2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:07.920\n in order to take away the enemy's ability\n\n2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:09.800\n to try to predict what you're gonna do\n\n2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:12.640\n to disrupt their technological progress cycles\n\n2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:16.120\n so that they don't have a clear target to aim at.\n\n2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:17.720\n And if you don't have a clear target to aim at,\n\n2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:18.880\n it's hard to hit it.\n\n2:05:18.880 --> 2:05:23.280\n Additionally, more distribution of assets and capability.\n\n2:05:23.280 --> 2:05:26.120\n So imagine being able to digitally model\n\n2:05:26.120 --> 2:05:28.120\n your weapon or your system\n\n2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:31.080\n or your entire tactical engagement or scenario,\n\n2:05:31.080 --> 2:05:32.400\n or allow a machine learning\n\n2:05:32.400 --> 2:05:35.280\n to help you better understand the technology\n\n2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:36.120\n that you need to build\n\n2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:38.760\n in order to defeat a particular scenario.\n\n2:05:38.760 --> 2:05:41.720\n And I'm talking hardware now, not just the tactic itself.\n\n2:05:41.720 --> 2:05:46.520\n And being able to use large amounts of simulation\n\n2:05:46.520 --> 2:05:49.200\n and machine learning to build individual assets\n\n2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:52.960\n that are small boutique using advanced manufacturing\n\n2:05:52.960 --> 2:05:56.080\n techniques for a mission or for a particular battle.\n\n2:05:56.080 --> 2:05:58.240\n Instead of just having these large things against an enemy,\n\n2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:02.080\n you're building systems and technology for individual cases.\n\n2:06:03.000 --> 2:06:05.960\n What about manned and unmanned teaming?\n\n2:06:05.960 --> 2:06:08.960\n So man and machine working together.\n\n2:06:08.960 --> 2:06:10.680\n Is there interesting ideas there?\n\n2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:13.440\n I approach it from the position\n\n2:06:13.440 --> 2:06:17.960\n that the human should be commanding\n\n2:06:17.960 --> 2:06:19.480\n from the highest level possible, right?\n\n2:06:19.480 --> 2:06:23.160\n So mission, objective, base, targeting.\n\n2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:25.440\n And so if, just for an example,\n\n2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:27.640\n if there's a building here and I want that building\n\n2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:29.720\n to go away, that's the message I wanna communicate.\n\n2:06:29.720 --> 2:06:31.400\n I don't wanna tell certain vehicles\n\n2:06:31.400 --> 2:06:32.360\n to be in a certain spot.\n\n2:06:32.360 --> 2:06:33.920\n I don't wanna know how much fuel they have.\n\n2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:34.760\n I don't even wanna know\n\n2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:36.520\n what capabilities they have necessarily.\n\n2:06:36.520 --> 2:06:39.400\n I just wanna know that I have the ability\n\n2:06:39.400 --> 2:06:41.720\n to select from a cloud of capabilities\n\n2:06:41.720 --> 2:06:43.560\n and the right assets are gonna arrive\n\n2:06:43.560 --> 2:06:46.240\n such that they deal with the contingencies\n\n2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:49.320\n around the target such as protection systems or EW\n\n2:06:49.320 --> 2:06:50.880\n and then can prosecute the target\n\n2:06:50.880 --> 2:06:53.440\n to the high enough probability of satisfaction\n\n2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:54.640\n that's needed by the mission commander.\n\n2:06:54.640 --> 2:06:57.160\n And that's the power of the human mind\n\n2:06:57.160 --> 2:07:00.560\n is it's able to do some of these strategic calculations\n\n2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:03.600\n but also ethical calculations, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:07:03.600 --> 2:07:05.280\n That's what humans are good at.\n\n2:07:05.280 --> 2:07:10.280\n Does it worry you a future where we have increasingly\n\n2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:14.400\n higher autonomy in our weapons systems, in our war?\n\n2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:15.600\n So you said building.\n\n2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:21.560\n What about telling a set of fully autonomous drones\n\n2:07:22.760 --> 2:07:26.560\n to get rid of all the terrorists in the city?\n\n2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:29.800\n So you said multiple buildings, region,\n\n2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:34.080\n that kind of, so greater and greater autonomy.\n\n2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:35.160\n Mm hmm.\n\n2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:36.920\n So that's a fear, right?\n\n2:07:38.720 --> 2:07:41.440\n You're viewing it from a we can cover more perspective\n\n2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:46.440\n which is fair and a lot of,\n\n2:07:46.960 --> 2:07:48.480\n I don't approach it from that topic.\n\n2:07:48.480 --> 2:07:51.200\n At least I don't think of it that way, at least morally.\n\n2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:54.200\n I think that with the advancement of warfare,\n\n2:07:54.200 --> 2:07:57.960\n assuming we have a just and moral leadership,\n\n2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:02.240\n if that's the case, then I am an advocate\n\n2:08:02.240 --> 2:08:04.600\n for increased autonomy and technology\n\n2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:09.040\n because I see it as an ability to be more precise.\n\n2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:14.040\n And if we trust the moral leadership of our government,\n\n2:08:14.240 --> 2:08:17.480\n then we would want to be as precise as possible\n\n2:08:17.480 --> 2:08:21.160\n in order to mitigate effects that we don't want.\n\n2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:24.520\n So I know that's not a satisfying answer\n\n2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:27.160\n and it leaves us maybe with bad feelings but.\n\n2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:32.160\n No, because having experienced sort of directly seen\n\n2:08:34.920 --> 2:08:39.920\n what it looks like when deliberately or carelessly\n\n2:08:41.880 --> 2:08:44.480\n war leads to the death of a large number of civilians\n\n2:08:44.480 --> 2:08:46.680\n as it does currently in Ukraine,\n\n2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:52.560\n the value of precision given ethical leadership\n\n2:08:52.560 --> 2:08:54.200\n becomes apparent.\n\n2:08:54.200 --> 2:08:57.320\n So there's something distinctly unethical\n\n2:08:57.320 --> 2:09:00.920\n about the murder of civilians in a time of war.\n\n2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:05.960\n And I think technology helps lessen that.\n\n2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:08.440\n Of course, all death is terrible\n\n2:09:08.440 --> 2:09:13.440\n but there's something about schools, hospitals\n\n2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:17.480\n being destroyed with everybody inside being killed.\n\n2:09:19.080 --> 2:09:21.240\n It's particularly terrible.\n\n2:09:21.240 --> 2:09:24.680\n It is and you approached it from the angle of\n\n2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:29.680\n more autonomy enables a wider swath of destruction.\n\n2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.440\n And that's where we get back into\n\n2:09:32.440 --> 2:09:34.920\n who's making the decisions based off of this.\n\n2:09:34.920 --> 2:09:38.520\n And my hope again would be that we would have the leadership\n\n2:09:38.520 --> 2:09:40.280\n that would use these things when needed\n\n2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:42.920\n in the precise way as possible to minimize that.\n\n2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:45.760\n And I've seen that firsthand, I've seen that in country,\n\n2:09:45.760 --> 2:09:50.760\n I've seen not blue forces but I've seen truck bombs go off\n\n2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:54.560\n on school buses, driving around Afghanistan\n\n2:09:56.040 --> 2:09:59.720\n while escorting convoys and it wasn't easy then\n\n2:09:59.720 --> 2:10:01.800\n and I'm sure it's not any easier now\n\n2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:03.880\n especially after what you've just seen.\n\n2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:07.200\n Do you have thoughts about the current war in Ukraine\n\n2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:09.600\n maybe from a military perspective,\n\n2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:11.360\n maybe from the Air Force perspective?\n\n2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:13.800\n So I can just mention a few things.\n\n2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:17.880\n There's the Barakhtar drones that are being used.\n\n2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:19.000\n They're unmanned.\n\n2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:21.560\n I think they have capability to be autonomous\n\n2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:23.880\n but they're usually remotely controlled.\n\n2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:26.640\n They're used for reconnaissance but they're also used\n\n2:10:26.640 --> 2:10:28.560\n by the Ukraine side for reconnaissance\n\n2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:33.440\n and I think also to destroy different technologies,\n\n2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:36.200\n tanks and so on, different targets like this.\n\n2:10:36.200 --> 2:10:40.040\n So there's also on the Russian side the Orlan 10.\n\n2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:44.440\n There's the fighter jets, MiG 29 on the Ukraine side\n\n2:10:44.440 --> 2:10:46.440\n and the Su 25 on the Russian side.\n\n2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.120\n Is there anything kind of stands out to you\n\n2:10:48.120 --> 2:10:51.640\n about this particular aspects of what this war looks like\n\n2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:53.680\n that's unique to what you've experienced?\n\n2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.800\n Maybe not unique but it's just been absolutely incredible\n\n2:10:56.800 --> 2:10:59.440\n to see the footage.\n\n2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:02.760\n We're watching war on Twitter essentially\n\n2:11:02.760 --> 2:11:06.200\n and to see these aircraft flying down low,\n\n2:11:06.200 --> 2:11:08.960\n spitting flares out, getting shot down,\n\n2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:12.360\n it's incredible to see this happening live\n\n2:11:12.360 --> 2:11:13.480\n for everyone to see.\n\n2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:16.200\n So that's just kind of a quick meta comment\n\n2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:18.560\n but as far as the actual,\n\n2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.720\n I think these small form factor UAVs\n\n2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.880\n where they're just like strapping weapon to it\n\n2:11:22.880 --> 2:11:25.320\n and flying over and trying to drop it at the right time\n\n2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:29.040\n or any of these type of commercial applications\n\n2:11:29.040 --> 2:11:31.920\n of technology into this ad hoc warfare area\n\n2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:33.160\n is incredibly interesting\n\n2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:36.480\n because it shows how useful that technology can be\n\n2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:38.800\n outside of the military.\n\n2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:40.000\n Especially like DJI, right?\n\n2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:41.720\n Like there's obviously a lot of technology in there\n\n2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:43.680\n is being leveraged for other capabilities\n\n2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:47.800\n within PLC military or at least we would assume.\n\n2:11:49.040 --> 2:11:52.160\n What happens if that is more widespread, right?\n\n2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:54.560\n Like what if we were creating our own drones\n\n2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:56.080\n and they were being used against us?\n\n2:11:56.080 --> 2:11:57.720\n Would we want to have some type of kill switch\n\n2:11:57.720 --> 2:11:58.800\n or something like that, right?\n\n2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:01.520\n So what I think governments are gonna have to consider\n\n2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:04.480\n like all these tools that are gonna be easily available\n\n2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:08.000\n to just any person could be turned into a tool of war\n\n2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.520\n or how do we stop that from being turned against us?\n\n2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:12.960\n Especially as we look at 10 years from now\n\n2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:15.520\n when we have a large number of autonomous UAVs\n\n2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:17.640\n delivering packages and doing everything else\n\n2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:19.560\n over our country and any one of those\n\n2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:20.800\n could be potentially a weapon\n\n2:12:20.800 --> 2:12:22.520\n if we don't have the proper security.\n\n2:12:22.520 --> 2:12:27.080\n Well, we're now in Texas and Texas values its guns\n\n2:12:27.080 --> 2:12:30.200\n and it sees guns as among other things\n\n2:12:30.200 --> 2:12:33.520\n a protector of individual freedom.\n\n2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:35.520\n You could see a future perhaps where,\n\n2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:38.560\n and I've certainly have experienced this in\n\n2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:41.480\n the empowering nature of this in Ukraine\n\n2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:45.960\n where you can put the fight for independence\n\n2:12:45.960 --> 2:12:50.160\n into your own hands by literally strapping explosives\n\n2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:54.280\n to GGI drones that you purchase on your own salary.\n\n2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:55.600\n I mean that one of the interesting things\n\n2:12:55.600 --> 2:12:58.280\n about the voluntary army in Ukraine\n\n2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:01.120\n is that they're basically using their own salary\n\n2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:04.200\n to buy the ammunition to fight for their independence.\n\n2:13:04.200 --> 2:13:07.920\n It's the very kind of ideal that sort of people speak about\n\n2:13:07.920 --> 2:13:11.920\n when they speak about the Second Amendment in this country\n\n2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:15.960\n that it's interesting to see\n\n2:13:15.960 --> 2:13:18.920\n the advanced technology version of that,\n\n2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:19.960\n especially in Ukraine.\n\n2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:22.760\n Sort of using computer vision technology\n\n2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:25.800\n for surveillance and reconnaissance\n\n2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:29.440\n to try to integrate that information\n\n2:13:29.440 --> 2:13:32.800\n to discover the targets and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:13:32.800 --> 2:13:35.400\n To put that in the hands of civilians\n\n2:13:35.400 --> 2:13:36.480\n is fascinating to see.\n\n2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:38.600\n So to sort of fight for their independence,\n\n2:13:38.600 --> 2:13:43.600\n you could say that to fight against authoritarian regime\n\n2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:45.360\n of your own government, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:47.840\n It shows you how complicated the war space in the future\n\n2:13:47.840 --> 2:13:50.440\n is gonna be invading a land like that\n\n2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:53.440\n where people have that many different types of resources.\n\n2:13:53.440 --> 2:13:55.760\n It could absolutely change warfare.\n\n2:13:55.760 --> 2:14:00.760\n I mean hopefully that creates a disincentive to start war.\n\n2:14:00.760 --> 2:14:04.440\n To go to war with a, yeah,\n\n2:14:04.440 --> 2:14:07.080\n sort of it changes the nature of guerrilla warfare.\n\n2:14:07.080 --> 2:14:08.360\n It does, yeah.\n\n2:14:08.360 --> 2:14:11.520\n I don't think Putin was expecting to be in that engagement\n\n2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:14.080\n quite as long as he has, of course,\n\n2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:16.520\n but it can show you how you can get caught up.\n\n2:14:16.520 --> 2:14:21.520\n If land wars turn into an inescapable quagmire each time\n\n2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:26.560\n due to the complications around the society's ability\n\n2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:28.760\n to access interesting tools,\n\n2:14:28.760 --> 2:14:33.760\n it could be a huge demotivator for aggression.\n\n2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.600\n Well, let me ask you about this.\n\n2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:41.160\n Do you think there will always be war in the world?\n\n2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:45.480\n Is this just a part of human nature?\n\n2:14:50.440 --> 2:14:51.520\n I think so.\n\n2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:53.600\n I think it is.\n\n2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.080\n Until we move past resource limitation,\n\n2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:00.920\n there's always gonna be at least\n\n2:15:00.920 --> 2:15:04.960\n that one particular cause of conflict.\n\n2:15:06.400 --> 2:15:09.240\n And then we can also consider all our psychological\n\n2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:14.920\n lizard brain emotions that cause us to act out,\n\n2:15:14.920 --> 2:15:18.800\n although hopefully we have enough things in place\n\n2:15:18.800 --> 2:15:22.160\n to stop that from rising to the level of war.\n\n2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:24.080\n But we have our own biology, our own psychology\n\n2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:25.480\n and evolution to combat.\n\n2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:28.280\n But there are pragmatic reasons\n\n2:15:28.280 --> 2:15:30.360\n to exert violence sometimes, unfortunately,\n\n2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:33.480\n and one of those cases could be resource limitations.\n\n2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:34.720\n And so your question was,\n\n2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:37.080\n do I think there will always be war in this world?\n\n2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:39.480\n My unfortunate answer is perhaps yes,\n\n2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:41.600\n but once there's more than one world\n\n2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:43.040\n and we're less resource constrained,\n\n2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:45.720\n then perhaps there'll be a valve of sorts for that.\n\n2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:51.680\n I talked to Jacco on this podcast.\n\n2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:55.520\n I told him about a song called Brothers in Arms\n\n2:15:55.520 --> 2:15:59.680\n by Dire Straits, and the question I asked him,\n\n2:15:59.680 --> 2:16:01.440\n I'd like to ask you the same question,\n\n2:16:01.440 --> 2:16:06.280\n is like the song goes, do you think we're fools\n\n2:16:06.280 --> 2:16:09.200\n to wage war on our brothers in arms?\n\n2:16:09.200 --> 2:16:14.160\n And Jacco said, our enemy is not our brothers in arms,\n\n2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:15.200\n they're the enemy.\n\n2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:21.200\n And so this kind of notion that we're all human,\n\n2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:25.120\n that's a notion, that's a luxury you can have,\n\n2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:29.600\n but there is good and bad in this world, according to Jacco.\n\n2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:34.600\n I hear that anger and hate when I was in Ukraine\n\n2:16:34.880 --> 2:16:39.880\n amongst some people, where there was a sense\n\n2:16:40.880 --> 2:16:42.400\n where you could be brothers and sisters,\n\n2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:44.280\n you can have family, you can have love\n\n2:16:45.800 --> 2:16:50.160\n from Ukraine to Russia, but now that everything's changed\n\n2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.880\n and generational hate for some people have taken over.\n\n2:16:54.880 --> 2:16:59.200\n So I guess the question is, when you think about the enemy,\n\n2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:02.280\n is there hate there?\n\n2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:04.400\n Do you acknowledge that they're human?\n\n2:17:04.400 --> 2:17:06.560\n I had never had any hate or discontent\n\n2:17:07.560 --> 2:17:10.280\n when I was doing my job, I'll say,\n\n2:17:10.280 --> 2:17:14.640\n but I was also never in a true life or death situation\n\n2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:17.280\n where they were gonna kill me if I didn't kill them.\n\n2:17:17.280 --> 2:17:21.280\n But I think that environment isn't one born out of hate,\n\n2:17:22.200 --> 2:17:24.040\n being in that type of scenario,\n\n2:17:24.040 --> 2:17:26.200\n in a sense it's how to be alive, right?\n\n2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:28.720\n I mean, our natural state is to be fighting\n\n2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:30.680\n for our survival in a sense.\n\n2:17:30.680 --> 2:17:33.920\n And so I think there's great power and strength\n\n2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:36.920\n and clarity perhaps in that, and it's not always born out\n\n2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:38.960\n of hate, but out of necessity,\n\n2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:41.120\n and we can't always control that.\n\n2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:45.400\n And I think as we focus on ourselves so much,\n\n2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:48.720\n we only dance on that pinhead when we find ourselves\n\n2:17:48.720 --> 2:17:50.880\n fighting for things that we need,\n\n2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:53.720\n and we're always taking from someone else at this point.\n\n2:17:53.720 --> 2:17:56.480\n And so as someone that's been in combat\n\n2:17:56.480 --> 2:17:58.560\n and very high above it, I'll say, right,\n\n2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:01.120\n where I didn't feel like I was in particular danger,\n\n2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:06.720\n I rationalized it and I made my way through it,\n\n2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:08.520\n knowing that there were people on the other side\n\n2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:12.320\n that were going to die that were on our side than not.\n\n2:18:12.320 --> 2:18:15.680\n So it was always a very human thing.\n\n2:18:15.680 --> 2:18:20.680\n It was never a reaction, emotional reaction of any sense.\n\n2:18:21.400 --> 2:18:26.400\n So you were able to see the basic, it's human versus human.\n\n2:18:27.840 --> 2:18:31.080\n There's some aspect of war that is basically\n\n2:18:32.680 --> 2:18:34.560\n one people fighting each other.\n\n2:18:36.280 --> 2:18:40.960\n Yes, at the end of the day, especially I would say\n\n2:18:40.960 --> 2:18:44.320\n in aviation, tactical aviation, there's almost a kinship\n\n2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:48.240\n with your enemies in a sense, because you know them\n\n2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:51.440\n in a sense, right, you know what they've been through,\n\n2:18:51.440 --> 2:18:52.680\n you know what training they've been through,\n\n2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:55.480\n you know where they failed, and you know what type\n\n2:18:55.480 --> 2:18:57.360\n of person they are, because it's a very unique person\n\n2:18:57.360 --> 2:18:59.720\n that does that job and usually can spot them.\n\n2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:02.320\n I guess it's the kind of respect you have\n\n2:19:02.320 --> 2:19:06.720\n for the craftsmanship of the job that's taken on.\n\n2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:08.520\n Certainly, and that person didn't come out\n\n2:19:08.520 --> 2:19:12.000\n in his $100 million jet because I pissed him off.\n\n2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:13.760\n It's not an emotional response.\n\n2:19:13.760 --> 2:19:17.760\n We're both there, maybe because we chose to be in some sense,\n\n2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:20.600\n but at the behest of someone else\n\n2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:22.800\n and outside of our control and power.\n\n2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:25.760\n And so in a sense for me, it's almost a challenge\n\n2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:27.920\n that we've engaged upon agreeably,\n\n2:19:27.920 --> 2:19:30.680\n but that's such a romantic version that I have the luxury\n\n2:19:30.680 --> 2:19:34.040\n to have being high in my castle in the jet up there,\n\n2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:35.360\n not on the ground.\n\n2:19:35.360 --> 2:19:37.440\n So I understand that it's a bit more romantic\n\n2:19:37.440 --> 2:19:40.920\n than perhaps, you know, someone on the ground\n\n2:19:40.920 --> 2:19:42.840\n experiencing all the horrors down there,\n\n2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:45.200\n because everything looks very small from above.\n\n2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:50.160\n And that's another aspect of war with greater autonomy\n\n2:19:50.160 --> 2:19:52.440\n when you're controlling the mission versus,\n\n2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:58.520\n you know, have a Genghis Khan type of intimacy\n\n2:19:58.520 --> 2:20:01.680\n in terms of the actual experience of war\n\n2:20:01.680 --> 2:20:05.260\n where you directly have, you murder with a sword\n\n2:20:05.260 --> 2:20:09.480\n versus a gun versus a remotely controlled drone\n\n2:20:09.480 --> 2:20:12.080\n versus a strategic mission assignment\n\n2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:14.920\n to an autonomous drone that executes.\n\n2:20:14.920 --> 2:20:17.580\n Abstracted away until it's just a small decision.\n\n2:20:18.480 --> 2:20:23.240\n And my worry is the people without a voice\n\n2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:29.160\n are completely forgotten and silenced\n\n2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:31.040\n in all of these calculations.\n\n2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:36.040\n I spoke to a lot of people, poor people that feel like\n\n2:20:36.400 --> 2:20:37.760\n they've never really had a voice\n\n2:20:37.760 --> 2:20:40.280\n and they're too easily forgotten,\n\n2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:42.520\n even within the country of Ukraine.\n\n2:20:42.520 --> 2:20:47.520\n It's the big city versus the rural divide, you know.\n\n2:20:48.440 --> 2:20:49.840\n It's easy to forget the people\n\n2:20:49.840 --> 2:20:52.360\n that don't have a Twitter account\n\n2:20:52.360 --> 2:20:57.120\n and that their basic existence is just trying to survive,\n\n2:20:57.120 --> 2:20:58.520\n trying to put food on the table\n\n2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:02.660\n and they don't have anything else, anything else.\n\n2:21:02.660 --> 2:21:06.160\n And they are the ones that truly feel the pain of war,\n\n2:21:06.160 --> 2:21:08.320\n of the supply chain going down,\n\n2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:10.120\n of the food supplies going down,\n\n2:21:10.120 --> 2:21:12.940\n of a cold winter without power.\n\n2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.080\n You're still young, but you've seen some things.\n\n2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:22.640\n So let me ask you to put on your wise sage hat\n\n2:21:22.640 --> 2:21:25.860\n and give advice to young people,\n\n2:21:25.860 --> 2:21:29.220\n whether they're fascinated by technology\n\n2:21:29.220 --> 2:21:31.860\n or fascinated by fighter jets,\n\n2:21:31.860 --> 2:21:35.260\n whether they're fascinated by sort of engineering\n\n2:21:35.260 --> 2:21:38.100\n or the way the stars look at night.\n\n2:21:38.100 --> 2:21:40.140\n What advice would you give them?\n\n2:21:40.140 --> 2:21:42.120\n How to have a career they can be proud of\n\n2:21:42.120 --> 2:21:44.220\n or how to have a life they can be proud of?\n\n2:21:45.460 --> 2:21:49.820\n I'd suggest that they don't fear looking foolish.\n\n2:21:49.820 --> 2:21:52.260\n I spent a large portion of my life\n\n2:21:52.260 --> 2:21:56.880\n considering the laughter or the comments\n\n2:21:56.880 --> 2:21:59.760\n at my statements as indication\n\n2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:02.000\n that I shouldn't pursue that.\n\n2:22:02.000 --> 2:22:05.880\n And so I kind of woke up to that fact a bit later,\n\n2:22:05.880 --> 2:22:10.880\n but I would advise that people trust in themselves\n\n2:22:11.000 --> 2:22:12.920\n and trust in the things that they care about.\n\n2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:15.560\n It doesn't matter if they're good at it.\n\n2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:17.440\n All that matters is that they find something\n\n2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:20.400\n that they can apply love and care to\n\n2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.240\n and they will grow better at it\n\n2:22:22.240 --> 2:22:25.080\n and then most likely make the world better because of it.\n\n2:22:25.080 --> 2:22:27.400\n And don't be afraid to look stupid.\n\n2:22:27.400 --> 2:22:30.000\n Don't be afraid to look stupid.\n\n2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:31.480\n Yeah, that's one of the things that I think\n\n2:22:31.480 --> 2:22:34.880\n as you get older, you're expected to be,\n\n2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:36.000\n to have it all figured out\n\n2:22:36.000 --> 2:22:39.160\n and so you are afraid to take on new things.\n\n2:22:39.160 --> 2:22:40.800\n But I think as long as you're always,\n\n2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:43.400\n okay, looking stupid and having a beginner's mind,\n\n2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:47.000\n you can get really, really far even later on in life.\n\n2:22:47.000 --> 2:22:48.760\n So this isn't just advice for young people.\n\n2:22:48.760 --> 2:22:52.520\n This is really advice for everybody.\n\n2:22:55.200 --> 2:22:56.640\n Maybe a dark question,\n\n2:22:56.640 --> 2:23:01.520\n but has there been a difficult time in your life,\n\n2:23:01.520 --> 2:23:03.760\n a really dark place you've gone in your mind\n\n2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:07.280\n that stands out that you had to really overcome?\n\n2:23:08.560 --> 2:23:13.020\n I would suggest that I've been pretty firm ground\n\n2:23:13.020 --> 2:23:14.120\n for most of my life.\n\n2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:18.400\n I haven't had too many personal tragedies.\n\n2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:21.640\n I'll say that have really defined me.\n\n2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:25.800\n Certainly none that I would think are outside the norm.\n\n2:23:25.800 --> 2:23:29.040\n So there was no truly low point.\n\n2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:30.680\n Actually, I have one and it's tough for me\n\n2:23:30.680 --> 2:23:33.920\n because I've spent most of my life beating motions\n\n2:23:33.920 --> 2:23:38.680\n and high emotional responses out of my system\n\n2:23:38.680 --> 2:23:40.060\n because that's what flying is, right?\n\n2:23:40.060 --> 2:23:43.420\n It's keeping a steady line and doing what you need to do.\n\n2:23:44.280 --> 2:23:45.200\n In fact, there's been studies\n\n2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:49.480\n that show reduced adrenaline production in fighter pilots\n\n2:23:49.480 --> 2:23:50.760\n for a number of years after they get out.\n\n2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:54.400\n But getting out of the Navy was difficult for me.\n\n2:23:54.400 --> 2:23:56.120\n And I wasn't expecting it to be.\n\n2:23:56.120 --> 2:23:59.520\n A lot of bravado and machoism, of course, in the military,\n\n2:23:59.520 --> 2:24:01.360\n especially in fighter community.\n\n2:24:01.360 --> 2:24:03.640\n And we all have our plans made up to get out\n\n2:24:03.640 --> 2:24:06.280\n and none of it really accounts\n\n2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:08.960\n for any type of mental health or anything like that.\n\n2:24:08.960 --> 2:24:11.600\n It's all very much, where am I gonna get my paycheck from?\n\n2:24:11.600 --> 2:24:12.680\n Where am I gonna move to?\n\n2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:16.400\n And whether it's the Navy or just individuals,\n\n2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:18.320\n truly understanding the difference that makes.\n\n2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:21.060\n And when I got out, it was difficult for me.\n\n2:24:21.060 --> 2:24:23.160\n I think a lot of guys in that job, when they get out,\n\n2:24:23.160 --> 2:24:26.280\n they almost, at least I had anxiety when I got out\n\n2:24:26.280 --> 2:24:29.920\n because I was so used to being highly involved\n\n2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:34.920\n in something that just was I was always involved with\n\n2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:36.240\n that when I got out,\n\n2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:38.640\n I didn't know how to fill that space essentially.\n\n2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:41.840\n And while I wouldn't say it was an overly\n\n2:24:41.840 --> 2:24:43.320\n traumatic experience, I think it's one\n\n2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:45.160\n that's not accounted for enough\n\n2:24:45.160 --> 2:24:46.880\n that people that are getting out,\n\n2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:49.140\n so I would encourage them to take it serious\n\n2:24:49.140 --> 2:24:51.680\n and actually think about it and respect the change\n\n2:24:51.680 --> 2:24:53.480\n because it is a big one.\n\n2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:58.480\n Well, if I may say, you found a place in nature currently,\n\n2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:01.920\n a home, is there, can you speak to that\n\n2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:04.040\n being a source of happiness for you?\n\n2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:04.880\n Absolutely.\n\n2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:06.220\n An escape from the world?\n\n2:25:06.220 --> 2:25:08.040\n Certainly, it very much is.\n\n2:25:08.040 --> 2:25:10.240\n Was it deliberate that you found it there?\n\n2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:12.120\n That's home for me.\n\n2:25:12.120 --> 2:25:14.920\n So, I moved back up to the Boston area\n\n2:25:14.920 --> 2:25:18.440\n and my wife and I had an idea after moving\n\n2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:20.280\n about eight or nine times in the Navy\n\n2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:23.560\n of kind of what we wanted just generally.\n\n2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:25.760\n And it was all really about the land\n\n2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:26.920\n and not about the house,\n\n2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:29.480\n we just wanted privacy and to be nearby.\n\n2:25:29.480 --> 2:25:31.920\n And so we ended up finding a lot of land,\n\n2:25:31.920 --> 2:25:34.160\n a parcel of land, we put a house on it\n\n2:25:34.160 --> 2:25:36.520\n and it provides me with a sense of peace\n\n2:25:36.520 --> 2:25:40.200\n that I think I can only get when I'm in nature.\n\n2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.040\n And a sense of clarity that helps me think,\n\n2:25:43.040 --> 2:25:45.500\n helps me relax, maybe it's so relaxing\n\n2:25:45.500 --> 2:25:46.640\n that helps me think, I don't know.\n\n2:25:46.640 --> 2:25:50.600\n But being surrounded by nature and birds and animals\n\n2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:54.600\n for me has always allowed me to,\n\n2:25:54.600 --> 2:25:55.840\n I don't know, feel most in touch\n\n2:25:55.840 --> 2:25:59.320\n with my own thoughts in a sense.\n\n2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:01.240\n It just provides clarity.\n\n2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.600\n And so this little sanctuary you could say I've built\n\n2:26:04.600 --> 2:26:08.920\n allows me to interface via a fiber line at my house\n\n2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:12.400\n but also feel like I'm a million miles away sometimes,\n\n2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:13.840\n which is the best of both worlds.\n\n2:26:13.840 --> 2:26:16.240\n A, you can just walk outside to escape at all.\n\n2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:17.080\n Yes.\n\n2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:21.440\n To experience life as hundreds of generations\n\n2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:23.480\n of human species have experienced it.\n\n2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:26.560\n Maybe it's the dichotomy, my desire for the fastness\n\n2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:28.940\n of technology and experience compared\n\n2:26:28.940 --> 2:26:31.340\n with the most basic baseline that we have.\n\n2:26:32.280 --> 2:26:33.120\n Isn't that strange?\n\n2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:34.920\n How do you square that?\n\n2:26:34.920 --> 2:26:36.120\n I don't know.\n\n2:26:36.120 --> 2:26:38.120\n How drawn you are to the cutting edge\n\n2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:41.400\n and still the calm you find in nature.\n\n2:26:41.400 --> 2:26:42.520\n I think it makes sense.\n\n2:26:42.520 --> 2:26:45.680\n Nature is vastly superior to almost all of our technology.\n\n2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:46.520\n From a technology perspective?\n\n2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:48.120\n Yeah, it is.\n\n2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:49.640\n And so in a way, it's being surrounded\n\n2:26:49.640 --> 2:26:51.280\n by perfection in a lot of senses.\n\n2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.160\n In the military and in general,\n\n2:26:55.160 --> 2:26:57.240\n have you contemplated your mortality?\n\n2:26:57.240 --> 2:26:59.320\n Have you been afraid of death?\n\n2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:01.320\n What's your relationship like with death?\n\n2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:06.160\n Well, I was willing to accept an oversized amount of risk,\n\n2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:08.600\n I'll say, when I was younger as an aviator.\n\n2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:10.840\n Not in the jet, but just that was my life.\n\n2:27:10.840 --> 2:27:13.600\n I felt like I was gonna live forever.\n\n2:27:13.600 --> 2:27:15.760\n And going out in the war, strangely,\n\n2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:19.280\n didn't really change that because as an aviator,\n\n2:27:19.280 --> 2:27:21.160\n again, we're riding up high on our horse up there.\n\n2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:25.720\n So there were times when I was in situations\n\n2:27:25.720 --> 2:27:28.280\n that could have resulted in death from flying\n\n2:27:28.280 --> 2:27:31.440\n or from emergency in the aircraft.\n\n2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:35.960\n But I'll be honest, I never really kind of sat down\n\n2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:39.360\n to think about the mortality of it afterwards.\n\n2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:41.960\n I feel like I kind of signed a check at the beginning\n\n2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:44.280\n and it was my job to perform as well as I could.\n\n2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:46.040\n And if something happened in that,\n\n2:27:46.040 --> 2:27:47.680\n then I better damn well be sure\n\n2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:49.440\n I would do my best at the time then.\n\n2:27:50.520 --> 2:27:53.720\n So I maybe didn't personally reflect on it\n\n2:27:53.720 --> 2:27:57.280\n as much as I one would think,\n\n2:27:57.280 --> 2:27:58.840\n because once you get in that machine,\n\n2:27:58.840 --> 2:28:00.760\n it doesn't give you a lot of time\n\n2:28:00.760 --> 2:28:05.000\n to sit back and philosophize on your current situation.\n\n2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:06.840\n And the same, just like we weren't seeing these,\n\n2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:08.560\n or when we seen these objects off the coast,\n\n2:28:08.560 --> 2:28:10.840\n we weren't necessarily examining them every day, right?\n\n2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:11.920\n We'd put them into that bucket\n\n2:28:11.920 --> 2:28:12.800\n because it wasn't something\n\n2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:14.840\n that was gonna kill us right away.\n\n2:28:14.840 --> 2:28:17.800\n And thinking about death when you're so close to it\n\n2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:19.600\n all the time would be debilitating.\n\n2:28:20.480 --> 2:28:22.520\n It would probably make you worse at your job.\n\n2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:23.360\n It would.\n\n2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:26.760\n Well, maybe you can think about death\n\n2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:28.360\n when you look out, when you go out into nature\n\n2:28:28.360 --> 2:28:32.880\n and think like the fact that this whole ride ends,\n\n2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.640\n it's such a weird thing.\n\n2:28:34.640 --> 2:28:37.840\n And the old makes way to new.\n\n2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:39.280\n And that's all throughout nature.\n\n2:28:39.280 --> 2:28:42.120\n And if you just look at the cruelty of nature\n\n2:28:42.120 --> 2:28:44.120\n or the beauty of nature, however you think about it,\n\n2:28:44.120 --> 2:28:47.720\n the fact that the big thing eats the little thing\n\n2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:53.480\n over and over, and that's just how it progresses.\n\n2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:55.720\n And that's how adaptation happens.\n\n2:28:55.720 --> 2:28:59.520\n Death is a requirement for evolution.\n\n2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:02.600\n And whether evolution allows us\n\n2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:04.640\n to see objective reality or not,\n\n2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:06.620\n it still gives you some interesting thoughts\n\n2:29:06.620 --> 2:29:08.400\n about perspectives of death,\n\n2:29:08.400 --> 2:29:11.760\n and especially considering it's a biological necessity\n\n2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:13.800\n as far as evolution is concerned.\n\n2:29:13.800 --> 2:29:14.640\n Yeah, it's weird.\n\n2:29:14.640 --> 2:29:18.560\n It's weird that there's been like 100 billion people\n\n2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:20.520\n that lived before us,\n\n2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:22.160\n and that you and I will be forgotten.\n\n2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:24.720\n This whole thing we're doing now is meaningless\n\n2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:26.880\n in that sense, but at the same time,\n\n2:29:26.880 --> 2:29:28.720\n it feels deeply meaningful somehow.\n\n2:29:31.040 --> 2:29:32.920\n I guess that's the question I wanna ask.\n\n2:29:32.920 --> 2:29:36.040\n When you go out to nature with family,\n\n2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:38.760\n what do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:40.100\n What's the meaning of life?\n\n2:29:42.440 --> 2:29:44.400\n Or maybe when you put on the night goggles,\n\n2:29:44.400 --> 2:29:47.180\n the night vision goggles and look up at the stars,\n\n2:29:48.100 --> 2:29:49.360\n why are we here?\n\n2:29:50.560 --> 2:29:51.920\n I can't speak for everyone,\n\n2:29:51.920 --> 2:29:55.640\n but at least the way I interpret it,\n\n2:29:55.640 --> 2:29:58.600\n or at least I feel like I interpret my way here,\n\n2:29:58.600 --> 2:30:02.320\n my job is, I feel like my role is just to be curious\n\n2:30:02.320 --> 2:30:04.680\n about the environment in a manner that allows us\n\n2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:07.080\n to understand as much as possible.\n\n2:30:07.080 --> 2:30:09.680\n I think that the human mind,\n\n2:30:09.680 --> 2:30:12.440\n whether it's just the mass inside our skull,\n\n2:30:12.440 --> 2:30:15.760\n or whether there's some type of quantum interactions\n\n2:30:15.760 --> 2:30:18.960\n going on, our mind has incredible ability\n\n2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:23.160\n to output new information in a universe\n\n2:30:23.160 --> 2:30:27.080\n that is somewhat stale of information, right?\n\n2:30:27.080 --> 2:30:30.960\n Our minds are somewhat unique in that we can imagine\n\n2:30:30.960 --> 2:30:33.280\n and perceive things that could never ever\n\n2:30:33.280 --> 2:30:35.240\n have possibly naturally occurred,\n\n2:30:35.240 --> 2:30:36.340\n and yet we can make it happen.\n\n2:30:36.340 --> 2:30:38.960\n We can instantiate that with enough belief\n\n2:30:38.960 --> 2:30:40.920\n that it's true and it can happen.\n\n2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:44.480\n And so for me, I feel like I just need to encourage that,\n\n2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:47.480\n to encourage interaction with reality\n\n2:30:47.480 --> 2:30:50.800\n such that it leaves us a newer and grander interactions\n\n2:30:50.800 --> 2:30:52.600\n with this universe.\n\n2:30:52.600 --> 2:30:55.440\n And all that starts with a little bit of curiosity.\n\n2:30:55.440 --> 2:30:57.080\n Exactly.\n\n2:30:57.080 --> 2:30:59.020\n Ryan, you're an incredible person.\n\n2:30:59.020 --> 2:31:00.280\n You've done so many things,\n\n2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:03.480\n and there's so much still ahead of you.\n\n2:31:03.480 --> 2:31:07.120\n Thank you for being brave enough to talk about UFOs\n\n2:31:07.120 --> 2:31:09.160\n and doing it so seriously,\n\n2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:10.640\n and thank you for pushing forward\n\n2:31:10.640 --> 2:31:12.820\n on all these fronts in terms of technology.\n\n2:31:12.820 --> 2:31:17.680\n So from just the fighter jets, the engineering of that,\n\n2:31:17.680 --> 2:31:21.040\n to the AIML applications in the combat setting,\n\n2:31:21.040 --> 2:31:24.400\n that's super interesting, and then now quantum.\n\n2:31:24.400 --> 2:31:26.560\n I can't wait to see what you do next.\n\n2:31:26.560 --> 2:31:28.320\n Thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.\n\n2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:29.140\n It was an honor.\n\n2:31:29.140 --> 2:31:29.980\n It was my pleasure.\n\n2:31:29.980 --> 2:31:31.320\n Thank you, Lex.\n\n2:31:31.320 --> 2:31:33.040\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:31:33.040 --> 2:31:34.880\n with Lieutenant Ryan Graves.\n\n2:31:34.880 --> 2:31:36.280\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:31:36.280 --> 2:31:39.040\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:43.120\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Buzz Aldrin.\n\n2:31:43.120 --> 2:31:47.200\n Bravery comes along as a gradual accumulation of discipline.\n\n2:31:47.200 --> 2:32:08.200\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
