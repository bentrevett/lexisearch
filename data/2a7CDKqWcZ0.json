Stephen is one of the greatest historians of all time,\n\n00:08.080 --> 00:11.320\n specializing in 20th and 21st century history\n\n00:11.320 --> 00:13.680\n of Russia and Eastern Europe.\n\n00:13.680 --> 00:16.000\n And he has written what is widely considered\n\n00:16.000 --> 00:20.320\n to be the definitive biography of Stalin in three volumes,\n\n00:20.320 --> 00:22.280\n two of which have been published.\n\n00:22.280 --> 00:25.280\n And the third focused on World War II\n\n00:25.280 --> 00:28.680\n and the years after he is in the midst of writing now.\n\n00:28.680 --> 00:30.840\n This conversation includes a response\n\n00:30.840 --> 00:33.680\n to my previous podcast episode with Oliver Stone\n\n00:33.680 --> 00:37.160\n that was focused on Vladimir Putin and the war in Ukraine.\n\n00:38.040 --> 00:41.200\n Stephen provides a hard hitting criticism of Putin\n\n00:41.200 --> 00:43.440\n and the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\n\n00:43.440 --> 00:45.760\n weighed and contextualized deeply\n\n00:45.760 --> 00:49.480\n in the complex geopolitics and history of our world,\n\n00:49.480 --> 00:52.560\n all with an intensity and rigor,\n\n00:52.560 --> 00:55.600\n but also wit and humor that makes Stephen\n\n00:55.600 --> 00:58.960\n one of my favorite human beings.\n\n00:59.960 --> 01:02.840\n Please also allow me to mention something\n\n01:02.840 --> 01:05.720\n that has been apparent and has weighed heavy\n\n01:05.720 --> 01:07.320\n on my heart and mind.\n\n01:08.720 --> 01:11.200\n This conversation with Stephen Kotkin\n\n01:11.200 --> 01:13.800\n makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Russia.\n\n01:15.000 --> 01:18.040\n The previous conversation with Oliver Stone\n\n01:18.040 --> 01:21.000\n makes it more dangerous for me to travel in Ukraine.\n\n01:21.000 --> 01:25.440\n This makes me sad, but it is the way of the world.\n\n01:25.440 --> 01:29.880\n I will nevertheless travel to both Ukraine and Russia.\n\n01:30.840 --> 01:33.800\n I need to once again see with my own eyes\n\n01:33.800 --> 01:38.480\n the land of my ancestors, where they suffered but flourished\n\n01:38.480 --> 01:41.760\n and eventually gave birth to say the old me.\n\n01:44.480 --> 01:47.600\n I need to hear directly the pain, anger and hope\n\n01:47.600 --> 01:51.320\n from both Ukrainians and Russians.\n\n01:51.320 --> 01:53.120\n I won't give details to my travel plans\n\n01:53.120 --> 01:55.200\n in terms of location and timing,\n\n01:55.200 --> 01:57.840\n but the trip is very soon.\n\n01:57.840 --> 02:02.840\n Whatever happens, I'm truly grateful for every day I'm alive\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:05.400\n and I hope to spend each such day\n\n02:05.400 --> 02:07.320\n adding a bit of love to the world.\n\n02:08.400 --> 02:09.280\n I love you all.\n\n02:10.200 --> 02:12.040\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n02:12.040 --> 02:17.040\n And now, dear friends, here's Stephen Kotkin.\n\n02:17.520 --> 02:20.200\n You are one of the great historians of our time\n\n02:20.200 --> 02:22.680\n specializing in the man, the leader,\n\n02:22.680 --> 02:24.680\n the historical figure of Stalin.\n\n02:24.680 --> 02:26.880\n So let me ask a challenging question.\n\n02:27.760 --> 02:32.760\n If you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years\n\n02:34.760 --> 02:38.120\n between Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Putin,\n\n02:38.120 --> 02:40.160\n what are the similarities and differences\n\n02:40.160 --> 02:42.600\n between the man and the historical figure,\n\n02:42.600 --> 02:45.080\n the historical trajectory of Stalin and Putin?\n\n02:46.720 --> 02:47.560\n Thank you, Lex.\n\n02:47.560 --> 02:50.200\n It's very nice to be here again with you.\n\n02:51.400 --> 02:52.400\n It's been a while.\n\n02:52.400 --> 02:53.240\n Good to see you.\n\n02:53.240 --> 02:54.240\n Yeah, good to see you as well.\n\n02:54.240 --> 02:55.520\n You're looking good.\n\n02:55.520 --> 02:56.360\n You as well.\n\n02:56.360 --> 02:59.160\n I see this podcast stuff is doing you right.\n\n02:59.160 --> 03:00.480\n Yeah.\n\n03:00.480 --> 03:05.000\n So we can't really put very easily Vladimir Putin\n\n03:05.000 --> 03:07.240\n in the same sentence with Joseph Stalin.\n\n03:07.240 --> 03:10.640\n Stalin is a singular figure\n\n03:10.640 --> 03:14.000\n and his category is really small.\n\n03:14.000 --> 03:18.440\n Hitler, Mao, that's really about it.\n\n03:18.440 --> 03:22.760\n And even in that category, Stalin is the dominant figure,\n\n03:22.760 --> 03:25.680\n both by how long he was in power\n\n03:25.680 --> 03:27.680\n and also by the amount of power,\n\n03:27.680 --> 03:30.280\n the military industrial complex he helped build\n\n03:30.280 --> 03:31.120\n and commanded.\n\n03:32.240 --> 03:34.560\n So Putin can't be compared to that.\n\n03:34.560 --> 03:39.000\n However, Putin's in the same building as Stalin.\n\n03:39.000 --> 03:43.240\n He uses some of the same offices as Stalin used.\n\n03:43.240 --> 03:46.520\n On some of those television broadcasts\n\n03:46.520 --> 03:48.480\n that we see of Putin at meetings\n\n03:48.480 --> 03:50.800\n and Putin inside the Kremlin,\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:53.640\n Stalin used to sit in those rooms\n\n03:53.640 --> 03:55.400\n and hold meetings in those rooms.\n\n03:55.400 --> 03:57.680\n That's the Imperial Senate\n\n03:57.680 --> 04:01.160\n built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building.\n\n04:01.160 --> 04:04.640\n Built by Catherine the Great in 18th century building\n\n04:04.640 --> 04:05.840\n inside the Kremlin.\n\n04:06.720 --> 04:11.720\n It's a dome building and you can see it on the panorama,\n\n04:12.600 --> 04:13.440\n the top of the building,\n\n04:13.440 --> 04:15.200\n at least you can see it on the panorama\n\n04:15.200 --> 04:17.000\n when you look over the Kremlin wall\n\n04:17.000 --> 04:20.240\n from many sites inside Moscow.\n\n04:21.320 --> 04:26.120\n So if he's not comparable to Stalin,\n\n04:26.120 --> 04:28.880\n he still works, as I said, in those same buildings,\n\n04:28.880 --> 04:31.800\n those same offices, partly.\n\n04:31.800 --> 04:34.800\n And so therefore, he's got some of the problems\n\n04:34.800 --> 04:36.080\n that Stalin had,\n\n04:36.080 --> 04:39.640\n which was managing Russian power in the world\n\n04:39.640 --> 04:43.600\n from a position of weakness vis a vis the West,\n\n04:43.600 --> 04:48.600\n but from an ambition, a grandiosity, in fact.\n\n04:49.480 --> 04:54.480\n And so this combination of weakness and grandeur, right?\n\n04:54.840 --> 04:56.960\n Of not being as strong as the West,\n\n04:56.960 --> 05:01.360\n but aspiring to be as great or greater than the West.\n\n05:01.360 --> 05:04.240\n That's the dilemma of Russian history\n\n05:04.240 --> 05:06.200\n for the past many centuries.\n\n05:06.200 --> 05:08.040\n It was the dilemma for the Tsars.\n\n05:08.040 --> 05:09.720\n It was the dilemma for Peter the Great.\n\n05:09.720 --> 05:12.120\n It was the dilemma for Alexander.\n\n05:12.120 --> 05:14.480\n It was the dilemma for Stalin.\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:16.800\n And it's the dilemma for Putin.\n\n05:16.800 --> 05:18.960\n Russia is smaller now\n\n05:18.960 --> 05:22.080\n compared to when Stalin was in that Kremlin.\n\n05:22.080 --> 05:25.440\n It's got pushed back to borders\n\n05:25.440 --> 05:28.000\n almost the time of Peter the Great.\n\n05:28.000 --> 05:31.200\n It's farther from the main European capitals now\n\n05:31.200 --> 05:34.160\n than any time since that 18th century.\n\n05:35.320 --> 05:39.080\n And the West has only grown stronger\n\n05:39.080 --> 05:40.160\n in that period of time.\n\n05:40.160 --> 05:42.640\n So the dilemma is greater than ever.\n\n05:43.680 --> 05:46.920\n The irony of being in that position,\n\n05:46.920 --> 05:48.240\n of sitting in the Kremlin,\n\n05:48.240 --> 05:50.680\n trying to manage Russian power in the world,\n\n05:50.680 --> 05:53.680\n trying to be a providential power,\n\n05:53.680 --> 05:57.080\n a country with a special mission in the world,\n\n05:57.080 --> 06:01.360\n a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization\n\n06:01.360 --> 06:03.520\n and yet not having the capabilities\n\n06:03.520 --> 06:05.880\n to meet those aspirations\n\n06:05.880 --> 06:09.200\n and falling farther and farther behind the West.\n\n06:09.200 --> 06:12.480\n The irony of all of that is the attempted solutions\n\n06:13.560 --> 06:17.000\n put Russia in a worse place every single time.\n\n06:17.000 --> 06:20.200\n So you try to manage the gap with the West.\n\n06:20.200 --> 06:23.760\n You try to realize these aspirations.\n\n06:23.760 --> 06:26.640\n You try to raise your capabilities\n\n06:26.640 --> 06:28.360\n and you build a strong state.\n\n06:28.360 --> 06:30.440\n The quest to build a strong state\n\n06:30.440 --> 06:33.400\n and use coercive modernization\n\n06:34.600 --> 06:38.400\n to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the West,\n\n06:38.400 --> 06:39.640\n at least to manage it.\n\n06:40.720 --> 06:45.720\n And the result is different versions of personalist rule.\n\n06:46.560 --> 06:48.600\n So they don't build a strong state.\n\n06:48.600 --> 06:50.520\n They build a personal dictatorship.\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:52.040\n They build an autocracy.\n\n06:53.120 --> 06:56.400\n And moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures\n\n06:56.400 --> 07:00.400\n which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma\n\n07:00.400 --> 07:04.960\n that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place.\n\n07:04.960 --> 07:08.400\n And so I call this Russia's perpetual geopolitics.\n\n07:08.400 --> 07:11.360\n I've been writing about this for many, many years.\n\n07:11.360 --> 07:14.840\n What's important about this analysis\n\n07:14.840 --> 07:19.840\n is this is not a story of eternal Russian\n\n07:20.240 --> 07:24.560\n cultural proclivity to aggression, right?\n\n07:24.560 --> 07:26.800\n It's not something that's in the mother's milk.\n\n07:26.800 --> 07:30.280\n It's not something that can't be changed.\n\n07:30.280 --> 07:33.320\n Russia doesn't have an innate\n\n07:33.320 --> 07:35.840\n cultural tendency to aggression.\n\n07:35.840 --> 07:37.000\n This is a choice.\n\n07:37.000 --> 07:39.560\n It's a strategic choice\n\n07:39.560 --> 07:42.480\n to try to match the power of the West,\n\n07:42.480 --> 07:46.560\n which from Russia's vantage point is actually unmatchable,\n\n07:46.560 --> 07:49.000\n but it's a choice that's made again and again.\n\n07:49.000 --> 07:50.520\n And Putin has made this choice,\n\n07:50.520 --> 07:52.920\n just as Stalin made the choice, right?\n\n07:52.920 --> 07:56.480\n Stalin presided over the World War II victory,\n\n07:56.480 --> 07:57.920\n and then he lost the peace.\n\n07:59.240 --> 08:02.400\n After he died in 1953,\n\n08:02.400 --> 08:06.680\n there was, of course, other rulers who succeeded him.\n\n08:06.680 --> 08:09.440\n He was still the most important person in the country\n\n08:09.440 --> 08:11.080\n after he died,\n\n08:11.080 --> 08:13.040\n because they were trying to manage that system\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:15.120\n that he built, and more importantly,\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:17.560\n manage that growing gap with the West.\n\n08:18.520 --> 08:21.120\n By the time the 90s rolled around,\n\n08:21.120 --> 08:25.040\n former Soviet troops, now Russian troops,\n\n08:25.040 --> 08:28.680\n withdrew from all those advanced positions\n\n08:28.680 --> 08:30.480\n that they had achieved as a result\n\n08:30.480 --> 08:32.320\n of the World War II victory,\n\n08:32.320 --> 08:34.640\n and it was Napoleon in reverse.\n\n08:34.640 --> 08:36.720\n They went on the same roads,\n\n08:36.720 --> 08:39.840\n but not from Moscow back to Paris,\n\n08:39.840 --> 08:44.440\n but instead from Warsaw and from East Berlin\n\n08:44.440 --> 08:48.720\n and from Tallinn and Riga and all the other places\n\n08:48.720 --> 08:53.560\n of former Warsaw Pact and former Soviet republics\n\n08:53.560 --> 08:55.480\n in the Baltic region.\n\n08:55.480 --> 08:58.040\n They went back to Russia in retreat,\n\n08:58.040 --> 09:02.000\n and so Stalin, in the fullness of time, lost the peace.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:07.000\n And Putin, in his own way, inheriting some of this,\n\n09:07.000 --> 09:11.120\n attempting to reverse it when, as I said,\n\n09:11.120 --> 09:14.080\n Russia was smaller, farther away, weaker,\n\n09:14.080 --> 09:16.280\n the West was bigger and stronger\n\n09:16.280 --> 09:21.280\n and had absorbed those former Warsaw Pact countries\n\n09:22.280 --> 09:24.120\n and Baltic states,\n\n09:24.120 --> 09:27.960\n because they voluntarily begged to join the West.\n\n09:27.960 --> 09:30.360\n The West didn't impose itself on them.\n\n09:30.360 --> 09:34.400\n It's a voluntary sphere of influence that the West conducts.\n\n09:34.400 --> 09:38.280\n And so that dilemma is where you can put Putin and Stalin\n\n09:38.280 --> 09:40.120\n in the same sentence,\n\n09:40.120 --> 09:43.400\n and the terrible outcome for Russia\n\n09:43.400 --> 09:46.640\n in the fullness of time also has echoes.\n\n09:46.640 --> 09:51.640\n But of course, Putin hasn't murdered 18 to 20 million people\n\n09:51.680 --> 09:54.840\n and the scale of his abilities to cause grief\n\n09:56.520 --> 09:59.960\n with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing like Stalin's.\n\n09:59.960 --> 10:02.200\n And so we have to be careful, right?\n\n10:02.200 --> 10:05.280\n Only Mao put bigger numbers on the board\n\n10:06.280 --> 10:08.240\n from a tragic point of view than Stalin.\n\n10:08.240 --> 10:10.120\n And numbers matter here,\n\n10:10.120 --> 10:12.920\n if we compare these singular figures.\n\n10:14.480 --> 10:16.760\n Yeah, Mao killed more people than Stalin\n\n10:16.760 --> 10:20.480\n because Mao had more people to kill.\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:22.440\n The most amazing thing about Mao\n\n10:22.440 --> 10:25.160\n is he watched Stalin do it.\n\n10:26.120 --> 10:28.640\n He watched Stalin collectivize agriculture\n\n10:28.640 --> 10:30.720\n and famine result.\n\n10:30.720 --> 10:34.880\n He watched Stalin impose this communist monopoly,\n\n10:34.880 --> 10:37.880\n and all of those people sent to prison\n\n10:37.880 --> 10:40.320\n or given a bullet in the back of the neck.\n\n10:40.320 --> 10:41.400\n He watched all of that,\n\n10:41.400 --> 10:43.680\n and then he did it again himself in China.\n\n10:43.680 --> 10:46.200\n Do you think he saw the human cost directly\n\n10:46.200 --> 10:48.280\n that when you say he saw,\n\n10:48.280 --> 10:51.160\n do you think he was focused on the policies\n\n10:51.160 --> 10:54.560\n or was he also aware distinctly as a human being\n\n10:54.560 --> 10:58.000\n of the human costs in the lives of peasants\n\n10:58.000 --> 11:01.720\n and in the lives of the working class and lives of the poor?\n\n11:01.720 --> 11:03.760\n I think the prima facie evidence\n\n11:03.760 --> 11:06.000\n is that he didn't value human life.\n\n11:07.120 --> 11:09.440\n Otherwise, I don't think after seeing\n\n11:09.440 --> 11:11.080\n the amount of lives that were taken\n\n11:11.080 --> 11:12.840\n in the Soviet experiment,\n\n11:12.840 --> 11:16.320\n he would have done something similar after that.\n\n11:16.320 --> 11:17.640\n I think the answer, Lex,\n\n11:17.640 --> 11:21.200\n is it's very hard to get inside Mao's head\n\n11:21.200 --> 11:24.080\n and figure out what he was really thinking.\n\n11:24.080 --> 11:27.160\n But if you just look at the results that happened,\n\n11:27.160 --> 11:29.120\n the policies that were undertaken\n\n11:29.120 --> 11:31.240\n and the consequences of them,\n\n11:31.240 --> 11:34.040\n you would have to conclude that there was,\n\n11:34.040 --> 11:38.640\n let's say, no value or little value placed on human life.\n\n11:38.640 --> 11:40.840\n Unfortunately, that's characteristic\n\n11:40.840 --> 11:43.000\n not only of communist dictators, right,\n\n11:43.000 --> 11:45.600\n of post communist dictators as well,\n\n11:45.600 --> 11:49.280\n but the scale of the horrors that they inflict,\n\n11:50.280 --> 11:54.520\n as horrific as they are, just can't compare.\n\n11:54.520 --> 11:58.480\n And so we're in a situation where Eurasia,\n\n11:58.480 --> 12:02.960\n that is to say the ancient civilizations of Eurasia,\n\n12:02.960 --> 12:07.160\n which would be Russia, Iran, China,\n\n12:08.560 --> 12:13.320\n all have some version of non democratic,\n\n12:13.320 --> 12:16.200\n illiberal autocratic regimes,\n\n12:16.200 --> 12:18.080\n and they're all pushing up against\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:21.080\n the greater power of the West in some form.\n\n12:21.080 --> 12:23.200\n Sometimes they coordinate their actions\n\n12:23.200 --> 12:25.280\n and sometimes they don't.\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:28.640\n But this is a very longstanding phenomenon, Lex,\n\n12:28.640 --> 12:33.400\n that predates Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping\n\n12:33.400 --> 12:37.520\n or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in Iran.\n\n12:37.520 --> 12:40.720\n So we'll talk about this, I think,\n\n12:40.720 --> 12:44.520\n really powerful framework of five dimensions\n\n12:44.520 --> 12:47.080\n of authoritarian regimes that you've put together.\n\n12:47.080 --> 12:49.720\n But first, let's go to this Napoleon\n\n12:49.720 --> 12:54.720\n and reverse retreat from Warsaw back.\n\n12:56.240 --> 12:59.800\n Putin has called, from the perspective of Putin,\n\n12:59.800 --> 13:02.600\n this retreat, this collapse of Stalin\n\n13:02.600 --> 13:07.540\n is one of the great tragedies of that region, of Russia.\n\n13:09.160 --> 13:14.160\n Do you think there's a sense where as Putin sits now\n\n13:14.200 --> 13:16.640\n in power for 22 plus years,\n\n13:16.640 --> 13:21.640\n he really dreams of a return to the power,\n\n13:25.240 --> 13:30.240\n the influence, the land of Stalin?\n\n13:31.280 --> 13:35.040\n So while you said that they're not in the same place\n\n13:35.040 --> 13:37.000\n in terms of the numbers of people\n\n13:38.360 --> 13:40.880\n that suffer due to their regime,\n\n13:40.880 --> 13:44.520\n do you think he hopes to have the same power,\n\n13:44.520 --> 13:47.080\n the same influence for a nation\n\n13:47.080 --> 13:50.480\n that was in the 30s, in the 40s, in the 50s\n\n13:51.800 --> 13:54.000\n of the 20th century under Stalin?\n\n13:54.000 --> 13:56.440\n If he does, Lex, he's deluding himself.\n\n13:57.760 --> 13:59.680\n We don't know for sure.\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:02.400\n Very few people talk to him.\n\n14:02.400 --> 14:05.560\n Very few people have access to him.\n\n14:05.560 --> 14:09.720\n A handful of Western leaders have met with him\n\n14:09.720 --> 14:11.240\n for short periods of time.\n\n14:11.240 --> 14:13.740\n Those inside Russia barely meet with him.\n\n14:13.740 --> 14:18.220\n His own minions in the regime barely have FaceTime with him.\n\n14:19.420 --> 14:21.620\n We don't know exactly what he thinks.\n\n14:21.620 --> 14:26.620\n It could be that he has delusions\n\n14:26.940 --> 14:29.580\n of reconquering Russian influence,\n\n14:29.580 --> 14:34.020\n if not direct control over the territories that broke away,\n\n14:34.820 --> 14:36.180\n but it's not gonna happen.\n\n14:36.180 --> 14:40.020\n Let's talk a little bit about this guy, Nikolai Patrushev.\n\n14:40.020 --> 14:43.500\n Nikolai Patrushev is probably not well known\n\n14:43.500 --> 14:45.220\n to your listeners.\n\n14:45.220 --> 14:48.700\n He's the head of Russia's Security Council.\n\n14:49.580 --> 14:53.500\n And so you could probably call him the second most important\n\n14:53.500 --> 14:56.860\n or second most powerful man in Russia,\n\n14:56.860 --> 14:58.780\n certainly inside the regime.\n\n14:59.780 --> 15:03.220\n Arguably, Navalny is the second most important person\n\n15:03.220 --> 15:06.140\n in the country and Russia is the second most powerful man\n\n15:06.140 --> 15:08.020\n and we'll talk about that later, I'm sure.\n\n15:08.020 --> 15:09.340\n In terms of influence, yes.\n\n15:09.340 --> 15:14.340\n Yes, but Patrushev is a version of Putin's right hand man.\n\n15:17.380 --> 15:22.380\n And Patrushev has been giving interviews in the press.\n\n15:22.500 --> 15:24.020\n You probably saw the interview\n\n15:24.020 --> 15:27.540\n with Nizavisimaya Gazeta not that long ago.\n\n15:27.540 --> 15:31.620\n He writes also his own blog like interventions\n\n15:31.620 --> 15:36.620\n in the public sphere using the few channels that are left.\n\n15:38.660 --> 15:41.100\n And what's interesting about Patrushev,\n\n15:41.100 --> 15:45.860\n and this could well reflect similar thinking to Putin's,\n\n15:45.860 --> 15:47.500\n which is why I'm bringing this up,\n\n15:48.700 --> 15:53.140\n is that he's got this conspiratorial theory\n\n15:53.140 --> 15:57.940\n that the West has been on a forever campaign\n\n15:57.940 --> 15:59.740\n to destroy Russia,\n\n15:59.740 --> 16:02.260\n just like it destroyed the Soviet Union\n\n16:02.260 --> 16:04.900\n and that everything the West does\n\n16:04.900 --> 16:07.420\n is meant to dismember Russia\n\n16:07.420 --> 16:11.100\n and that Russia is fighting an existential battle\n\n16:11.100 --> 16:13.020\n against the West.\n\n16:13.020 --> 16:16.580\n And so for example, the CIA and the American government\n\n16:16.580 --> 16:19.020\n wanted to bring down the Soviet Union.\n\n16:19.020 --> 16:21.100\n Nevermind that the Bush administration,\n\n16:21.100 --> 16:23.260\n the first Bush, the father,\n\n16:23.260 --> 16:26.540\n was trying desperately to hold the Soviet Union together\n\n16:26.540 --> 16:30.420\n because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue\n\n16:30.420 --> 16:33.540\n and the nukes that might get loose\n\n16:33.540 --> 16:37.540\n as a result of a Soviet collapse.\n\n16:37.540 --> 16:40.580\n And it wasn't until the very last moment\n\n16:40.580 --> 16:44.780\n where Bush decided, his administration decided\n\n16:44.780 --> 16:48.780\n to back those Republican leaders\n\n16:48.780 --> 16:51.460\n who were breaking away from Mikhail Gorbachev\n\n16:51.460 --> 16:53.820\n and the Soviet Union, right?\n\n16:53.820 --> 16:56.340\n So nevermind the empirics of it.\n\n16:56.340 --> 16:59.060\n Nevermind that Bill Clinton's administration\n\n16:59.060 --> 17:03.580\n following George Bush sent boatloads of money,\n\n17:03.580 --> 17:06.660\n Western taxpayer money to Russia.\n\n17:06.660 --> 17:08.740\n We don't know exactly how much\n\n17:08.740 --> 17:10.620\n because it came from different sources.\n\n17:10.620 --> 17:13.260\n People talk about how there was no Marshall Plan.\n\n17:13.260 --> 17:17.620\n It was tens of billions of dollars from various sources,\n\n17:17.620 --> 17:20.180\n from the IMF and other sources.\n\n17:20.180 --> 17:22.780\n And next it disappeared, it's gone.\n\n17:22.780 --> 17:25.100\n Just like the German money that went to Gorbachev\n\n17:25.100 --> 17:26.740\n for unification disappeared\n\n17:26.740 --> 17:28.980\n even before the Soviet collapsed.\n\n17:28.980 --> 17:32.220\n The money disappeared, but the West sent the money.\n\n17:32.220 --> 17:33.980\n So how was that a plot?\n\n17:33.980 --> 17:37.220\n And then you could go all the way, Obama's administration,\n\n17:37.220 --> 17:39.860\n George Bush trying to do business deals\n\n17:39.860 --> 17:43.180\n and reset the relations and Obama administration\n\n17:43.180 --> 17:44.780\n trying to reset the relations\n\n17:44.780 --> 17:48.060\n and doing nothing after the Georgian war\n\n17:48.060 --> 17:51.980\n and slapping Putin on the wrist,\n\n17:51.980 --> 17:55.100\n following the seizure force of Putin.\n\n17:55.100 --> 17:56.740\n And you could go on and you could go on\n\n17:56.740 --> 17:59.100\n all the way through the Trump administration\n\n17:59.100 --> 18:01.940\n telling Putin that he's right.\n\n18:01.940 --> 18:05.140\n Trump believes Putin and doesn't believe US intelligence\n\n18:05.140 --> 18:07.020\n about Russian efforts to interfere\n\n18:07.020 --> 18:08.860\n in American domestic politics.\n\n18:08.860 --> 18:11.780\n So despite all the empirics of it,\n\n18:11.780 --> 18:14.820\n you have Patrushev and likely Putin\n\n18:14.820 --> 18:19.500\n talking about this multi decade Western conspiracy\n\n18:19.500 --> 18:21.580\n to bring Russia down.\n\n18:21.580 --> 18:23.580\n At the same time as that's happening,\n\n18:23.580 --> 18:27.060\n the Germans are voluntarily increasing\n\n18:27.060 --> 18:30.020\n their dependence on Russian energy,\n\n18:30.020 --> 18:33.020\n voluntarily increasing their dependence on Russia.\n\n18:33.020 --> 18:36.020\n So here's the conspiracy to bring Russia down.\n\n18:36.020 --> 18:39.940\n The French who fantasize about themselves\n\n18:39.940 --> 18:43.140\n as a diplomatic superpower are constantly,\n\n18:43.140 --> 18:46.220\n the French leaders are constantly running to the Kremlin\n\n18:46.220 --> 18:48.220\n to ask what Russia needs,\n\n18:48.220 --> 18:51.540\n what concessions from the West Russia needs to be filled\n\n18:51.540 --> 18:53.740\n to feel respected again.\n\n18:53.740 --> 18:58.700\n The British provide all manner of money laundering\n\n18:58.700 --> 19:01.540\n and reputation laundering services\n\n19:01.540 --> 19:03.580\n for the whole Russian oligarchy,\n\n19:03.580 --> 19:07.780\n including the state officials who are looting the state\n\n19:07.780 --> 19:10.940\n and using the West British institutions\n\n19:10.940 --> 19:11.980\n to launder their money.\n\n19:11.980 --> 19:15.740\n So all of this is happening and yet Patrushev imagines\n\n19:15.740 --> 19:19.220\n this conspiracy to bring Russia down by the West.\n\n19:19.220 --> 19:22.020\n And so that's what we've got in the Kremlin again.\n\n19:22.020 --> 19:26.900\n Stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the West.\n\n19:26.900 --> 19:28.500\n Everything that happened in the world\n\n19:28.500 --> 19:30.540\n was part of a Western conspiracy\n\n19:30.540 --> 19:32.300\n directed against the Soviet Union\n\n19:32.300 --> 19:34.140\n and now directed against Russia.\n\n19:34.140 --> 19:37.700\n Even though the West is trying to appease,\n\n19:37.700 --> 19:39.620\n the West is offering its services,\n\n19:39.620 --> 19:42.220\n the West is trying to change Russia through investment\n\n19:42.220 --> 19:46.660\n in a positive way, but instead the West is what's changing.\n\n19:46.660 --> 19:48.460\n The West is becoming more corrupt.\n\n19:48.460 --> 19:50.540\n Western services are being corrupted\n\n19:50.540 --> 19:52.860\n by the relationship with Russia.\n\n19:52.860 --> 19:54.860\n So you have to ask yourself,\n\n19:54.860 --> 19:58.140\n who are these people in power in the Kremlin\n\n19:58.140 --> 20:02.300\n who imagine that while they're availing themselves\n\n20:02.300 --> 20:07.020\n of every service and every blandishment of the West,\n\n20:07.020 --> 20:09.220\n while they're availing themselves of this,\n\n20:09.220 --> 20:12.620\n that they're fighting a conspiracy by the West\n\n20:12.620 --> 20:14.420\n to bring them down.\n\n20:14.420 --> 20:19.420\n So this is what they call the Abyssinia in Russian,\n\n20:21.460 --> 20:23.540\n which is a term, as you know,\n\n20:23.540 --> 20:26.860\n that means those who are resentful,\n\n20:26.860 --> 20:29.140\n or you might call them the losers,\n\n20:29.140 --> 20:30.980\n the losers in the transition.\n\n20:31.860 --> 20:34.380\n So when the Soviet Union fell\n\n20:34.380 --> 20:38.740\n and there was a very substantial diminution\n\n20:38.740 --> 20:41.580\n in Russian power and influence in the world,\n\n20:41.580 --> 20:43.980\n a lot of people lost out.\n\n20:43.980 --> 20:46.900\n They weren't able to steal the property.\n\n20:46.900 --> 20:50.500\n They weren't able to loot the state in the 90s.\n\n20:50.500 --> 20:52.740\n And they were on the outside.\n\n20:52.740 --> 20:55.220\n They gradually came back in.\n\n20:55.220 --> 20:58.300\n They were the losers in the transition domestically.\n\n20:59.180 --> 21:04.180\n And for them, they wanted to reverse\n\n21:04.180 --> 21:05.940\n being on the losing side.\n\n21:05.940 --> 21:10.060\n And so they began to expropriate, to steal the money,\n\n21:10.060 --> 21:14.900\n steal the property from those first thieves\n\n21:14.900 --> 21:16.940\n who stole in the 90s.\n\n21:16.940 --> 21:20.100\n And the 2000s and on have been about restealing,\n\n21:20.100 --> 21:23.180\n taking the losers in the transition,\n\n21:23.180 --> 21:25.900\n taking the money from the winners\n\n21:25.900 --> 21:30.620\n and reversing this resentment, this loser status.\n\n21:30.620 --> 21:33.620\n Those are your Patrushevs and your Putins.\n\n21:33.620 --> 21:36.580\n But at the same time, this blows out\n\n21:36.580 --> 21:41.580\n to let's reverse the losses, being on the losing side,\n\n21:41.740 --> 21:43.580\n the roiling resentment\n\n21:43.580 --> 21:47.020\n at the decline of their power internationally.\n\n21:47.020 --> 21:49.620\n Let's try to reverse that too.\n\n21:49.620 --> 21:54.620\n So you have a profound psychological whole generation\n\n21:55.140 --> 21:58.340\n of people who are on the losing end domestically\n\n21:58.340 --> 22:00.460\n and reverse that domestically.\n\n22:00.460 --> 22:02.260\n That's what the Putin regime is about.\n\n22:02.260 --> 22:06.180\n Remember Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Yukos?\n\n22:06.180 --> 22:09.300\n Remember all the companies that are now owned\n\n22:09.300 --> 22:12.660\n by Putin cronies because they were taken away\n\n22:12.660 --> 22:15.700\n from whoever stole them in the first place.\n\n22:15.700 --> 22:19.180\n And now they're trying to do that on the international scale.\n\n22:19.180 --> 22:22.860\n It's one thing to put domestic opponents in jail.\n\n22:22.860 --> 22:27.020\n It's one thing to take away someone's property domestically,\n\n22:27.020 --> 22:30.020\n but you're not gonna reverse the power of the West\n\n22:30.020 --> 22:33.180\n with the diminished Russia that you have.\n\n22:33.180 --> 22:37.860\n And so that project, that Patrushev project,\n\n22:37.860 --> 22:41.140\n which we see him expressing again and again,\n\n22:41.140 --> 22:43.020\n he speaks about it publicly.\n\n22:43.020 --> 22:48.020\n It's not something that we need to go looking for,\n\n22:48.020 --> 22:50.460\n a quest, the secret, we can't find it.\n\n22:50.460 --> 22:51.540\n What are they thinking?\n\n22:51.540 --> 22:53.740\n It's right there in front of our face.\n\n22:53.740 --> 22:56.660\n And Putin has spoken the same way for a long time.\n\n22:56.660 --> 22:59.820\n People point to the 2007 speech\n\n22:59.820 --> 23:01.580\n at the Munich Security Conference\n\n23:01.580 --> 23:04.180\n that Putin delivered, and certainly your listeners\n\n23:04.180 --> 23:06.540\n could use a snippet or two of that,\n\n23:06.540 --> 23:09.180\n just like they could use a couple of quotes\n\n23:09.180 --> 23:13.140\n from Patrushev to contextualize what we're talking about.\n\n23:13.140 --> 23:16.980\n But it predates the 2007 Munich speech,\n\n23:16.980 --> 23:21.980\n the reaction to Ukraine's uprising in 2004,\n\n23:22.900 --> 23:27.900\n attempt to steal the election inside Ukraine,\n\n23:27.900 --> 23:31.020\n which the Ukrainian people rose up valiantly\n\n23:31.020 --> 23:34.940\n against and risked their lives and overturned, right?\n\n23:34.940 --> 23:38.420\n So there were public statements from Putin already back then,\n\n23:38.420 --> 23:41.300\n the statements about Khodorkovsky in 2003\n\n23:41.300 --> 23:44.020\n when he was arrested and expropriated.\n\n23:44.020 --> 23:49.020\n This is a longstanding deeply psychological issue,\n\n23:51.100 --> 23:53.740\n which is about managing Russian power in the world,\n\n23:53.740 --> 23:55.940\n as I was saying, the gap with the West,\n\n23:55.940 --> 23:59.140\n but has this further dimension of feeling like losers\n\n23:59.140 --> 24:03.540\n and wanting to reverse that, that's their life experience.\n\n24:03.540 --> 24:04.580\n I'd be a zhenei.\n\n24:04.580 --> 24:09.580\n So there's that resentment that fuels this narrative,\n\n24:09.980 --> 24:14.500\n fuels this geopolitics and internal policy.\n\n24:14.500 --> 24:16.860\n But so resentment is behind some of the worst things\n\n24:16.860 --> 24:19.220\n that have ever been done in human history.\n\n24:19.220 --> 24:22.540\n Hitler was probably fueled by resentment.\n\n24:22.540 --> 24:26.020\n So resentment is a really powerful force, yes.\n\n24:26.020 --> 24:30.260\n Just to maybe not push back,\n\n24:30.260 --> 24:33.300\n but to give fuller context on the West,\n\n24:33.300 --> 24:38.300\n you said there's a narrative from Putin's Russia\n\n24:39.460 --> 24:42.220\n that the West is somehow an enemy,\n\n24:42.220 --> 24:44.340\n you position everything against the West,\n\n24:45.180 --> 24:47.860\n but is there a degree and to what degree\n\n24:47.860 --> 24:50.860\n is the West willing to feed that narrative?\n\n24:50.860 --> 24:53.980\n That it's also convenient for the West to have an enemy.\n\n24:53.980 --> 24:56.740\n It seems like in the place, in the span,\n\n24:58.260 --> 25:00.580\n it seems like in geopolitics,\n\n25:00.580 --> 25:05.580\n having an enemy is useful for forming a narrative.\n\n25:06.380 --> 25:09.860\n Now, having an enemy for the basic respect of humanity\n\n25:09.860 --> 25:12.980\n is not good, but in terms of maintaining power,\n\n25:12.980 --> 25:15.580\n if you're a leader in a game of geopolitics,\n\n25:15.580 --> 25:18.580\n it seems to be good to have an enemy.\n\n25:18.580 --> 25:21.700\n It seems to be good to have something like a cold war.\n\n25:21.700 --> 25:23.500\n We can always point your finger and says,\n\n25:23.500 --> 25:27.220\n all our actions are fighting this evil,\n\n25:27.220 --> 25:28.540\n whatever that evil is.\n\n25:28.540 --> 25:32.260\n It could be like with George W. Bush, the war on terror.\n\n25:32.260 --> 25:33.660\n Terrorism is this evil.\n\n25:33.660 --> 25:35.400\n You can always point at something.\n\n25:35.400 --> 25:38.080\n So you've made it seem that the West is trying.\n\n25:38.080 --> 25:39.740\n There's a lot of forces within the West\n\n25:39.740 --> 25:42.660\n that are trying to reach out a friendly hand,\n\n25:42.660 --> 25:46.580\n trying to help, sending money, sending compassion,\n\n25:46.580 --> 25:48.020\n trying to sort of.\n\n25:48.020 --> 25:51.100\n Trying to integrate Russia into a global institution.\n\n25:51.100 --> 25:51.940\n Exactly.\n\n25:51.940 --> 25:55.180\n Which was a longstanding multi decade effort\n\n25:55.180 --> 25:56.780\n across multiple countries\n\n25:56.780 --> 25:59.660\n and multiple administrations in those countries.\n\n25:59.660 --> 26:02.140\n But is there also warmongers on the West?\n\n26:02.140 --> 26:03.020\n Of course, Lex.\n\n26:03.020 --> 26:04.420\n Of course you're right about that.\n\n26:04.420 --> 26:06.120\n But let's put it this way.\n\n26:06.120 --> 26:08.060\n People talk about the cold war\n\n26:08.940 --> 26:12.860\n and they usually looking to assign blame for the cold war\n\n26:12.860 --> 26:17.020\n as if it's some kind of mistake, a misunderstanding,\n\n26:17.020 --> 26:20.060\n or a search for an enemy that was convenient\n\n26:20.060 --> 26:23.100\n to rally domestic politics.\n\n26:23.100 --> 26:28.100\n So Lex, there's a coup in Czechoslovakia\n\n26:28.100 --> 26:32.860\n and somebody installs a communist regime in February 1948.\n\n26:33.700 --> 26:34.820\n No reaction to that?\n\n26:34.820 --> 26:36.660\n That's just okay?\n\n26:36.660 --> 26:39.060\n There's a blockade of Berlin.\n\n26:39.060 --> 26:40.660\n Is that cool by you?\n\n26:40.660 --> 26:44.340\n Where they try to strangle West Berlin\n\n26:44.340 --> 26:46.500\n so that they can swallow West Berlin\n\n26:46.500 --> 26:48.080\n and add it to East Berlin.\n\n26:48.080 --> 26:50.220\n You cool with that?\n\n26:50.220 --> 26:54.700\n How about Korean War, invasion of North Korea,\n\n26:54.700 --> 26:57.100\n invasion of South Korea by North Korea?\n\n26:57.100 --> 26:58.940\n You cool with that?\n\n26:58.940 --> 27:01.660\n How about the murders and the show trials\n\n27:01.660 --> 27:05.220\n up and down Eastern Europe in the late 40s\n\n27:05.220 --> 27:08.060\n after the imposition of the clone regimes?\n\n27:08.060 --> 27:09.780\n You good with that?\n\n27:09.780 --> 27:12.300\n Yeah, it's very convenient to have an enemy.\n\n27:12.300 --> 27:13.700\n I agree with you.\n\n27:13.700 --> 27:17.120\n But you know, there was some actions, Lex.\n\n27:17.120 --> 27:19.860\n There was some threats to people's freedom.\n\n27:19.860 --> 27:21.860\n There was some invasions.\n\n27:21.860 --> 27:25.920\n There was some aggression and violence on a mass scale,\n\n27:25.920 --> 27:28.140\n like collectivization of Eastern Europe.\n\n27:28.140 --> 27:30.640\n And we could go on, Lex, with the examples.\n\n27:30.640 --> 27:33.100\n I'm just giving a few of them.\n\n27:33.100 --> 27:36.060\n And so the Cold War was not a mistake.\n\n27:36.060 --> 27:38.500\n It was not a misunderstanding.\n\n27:38.500 --> 27:41.340\n We don't have to blame someone for the Cold War.\n\n27:41.340 --> 27:44.040\n We have to give credit for the Cold War.\n\n27:44.040 --> 27:47.620\n The Truman administration deserves credit\n\n27:47.620 --> 27:50.580\n for standing up to Stalin's regime,\n\n27:50.580 --> 27:53.380\n for standing up to these actions,\n\n27:53.380 --> 27:57.020\n for saying, yeah, we're not just gonna take this.\n\n27:57.020 --> 27:59.040\n We're not gonna let this go on.\n\n27:59.040 --> 28:02.660\n We're not gonna let this expand to further territories.\n\n28:02.660 --> 28:04.980\n We're gonna create the NATO alliance.\n\n28:04.980 --> 28:09.760\n And we're gonna rally democratic liberal regimes\n\n28:09.760 --> 28:12.160\n to stand up to this illiberalism,\n\n28:12.160 --> 28:14.500\n this violence, and this aggression.\n\n28:14.500 --> 28:19.180\n And so, yeah, Lex, it's always convenient to have an enemy.\n\n28:19.180 --> 28:20.720\n But there was an enemy.\n\n28:21.960 --> 28:24.200\n Nikolai Leonov, who recently died,\n\n28:24.200 --> 28:28.900\n he died in April 2022, and he had a major funeral.\n\n28:28.900 --> 28:33.900\n He was the last head analyst of the Soviet KGB.\n\n28:36.420 --> 28:39.320\n And Leonov is one of the most important figures\n\n28:39.320 --> 28:41.780\n for understanding the Soviet collapse.\n\n28:41.780 --> 28:45.140\n And he has the best memoir on the Soviet collapse,\n\n28:45.140 --> 28:48.060\n which is known in Russian as Likholetya.\n\n28:49.060 --> 28:50.960\n You will understand that.\n\n28:50.960 --> 28:55.960\n And you'll help your podcast listeners understand.\n\n28:56.140 --> 29:00.820\n There's a singularity to that kind of expression, Likholetya.\n\n29:00.820 --> 29:02.280\n Leonov just died.\n\n29:02.280 --> 29:04.940\n But one of the things, and in fact,\n\n29:04.940 --> 29:09.580\n the people who were supposedly arrested by Putin\n\n29:09.580 --> 29:12.100\n as scapegoats for the Ukraine war,\n\n29:12.100 --> 29:16.300\n the main one, Sergei Beseda, gave the eulogy\n\n29:16.300 --> 29:19.620\n at Leonov's funeral in April 2022,\n\n29:19.620 --> 29:22.180\n showing that it's a lie that all of these people\n\n29:22.180 --> 29:23.740\n have been arrested and purged\n\n29:23.740 --> 29:27.500\n and other nonsense in social media.\n\n29:27.500 --> 29:29.500\n But to get back to what Leonov said\n\n29:29.500 --> 29:33.020\n and get back to your enemy point, Leonov said,\n\n29:33.020 --> 29:35.700\n you know, the West spent all this time\n\n29:35.700 --> 29:39.020\n blackening the image of the Soviet Union.\n\n29:39.020 --> 29:43.980\n All these resources and propaganda and covert operations\n\n29:43.980 --> 29:45.800\n to blacken the Soviet image.\n\n29:45.800 --> 29:48.140\n And they did, Lex, the West did do that.\n\n29:48.140 --> 29:50.620\n And then Leonov wrote in the next sentence,\n\n29:50.620 --> 29:51.660\n and you know what?\n\n29:51.660 --> 29:54.700\n We gave them a lot of material to work with\n\n29:54.700 --> 29:57.220\n to blacken our image.\n\n29:57.220 --> 30:02.220\n Yeah, so you're saying a kind of sobering reality,\n\n30:02.360 --> 30:05.100\n which it is possible to some degree to draw a line\n\n30:05.100 --> 30:07.580\n between the good guys and the bad guys.\n\n30:07.580 --> 30:10.020\n Freedom is better than unfreedom, Lex.\n\n30:10.980 --> 30:12.820\n It's a lot better than unfreedom,\n\n30:12.820 --> 30:15.660\n and a guy like you understands that really well.\n\n30:15.660 --> 30:18.940\n Well, so yes, but those are all, you know,\n\n30:18.940 --> 30:21.300\n there's words like justice, freedom.\n\n30:24.940 --> 30:26.220\n What else?\n\n30:26.220 --> 30:31.220\n Love, you can use a lot of words that Hitler himself used\n\n30:31.340 --> 30:36.260\n to describe why he is actually creating a better world\n\n30:36.260 --> 30:37.860\n than those he's fighting.\n\n30:37.860 --> 30:39.280\n So some of it is propaganda.\n\n30:39.280 --> 30:41.300\n The question is on the ground,\n\n30:41.300 --> 30:43.400\n what is actually increasing the amount of freedom\n\n30:43.400 --> 30:44.240\n in the world, human prosperity?\n\n30:44.240 --> 30:45.860\n Institutions, Lex, right?\n\n30:45.860 --> 30:48.500\n We're not talking about propaganda here.\n\n30:48.500 --> 30:50.820\n When we use words like freedom,\n\n30:50.820 --> 30:53.340\n we're talking about rule of law.\n\n30:53.340 --> 30:55.900\n We're talking about protection of civil liberties.\n\n30:55.900 --> 30:58.980\n We're talking about protection of private property.\n\n30:58.980 --> 31:01.220\n We're talking about an independent\n\n31:01.220 --> 31:03.460\n and well funded judiciary.\n\n31:03.460 --> 31:07.220\n We're talking about an impartial, non corrupt,\n\n31:07.220 --> 31:09.360\n competent civil service.\n\n31:09.360 --> 31:11.580\n We're talking about separation of powers\n\n31:11.580 --> 31:14.660\n where the executive branch's power is limited,\n\n31:14.660 --> 31:17.220\n usually by an elected parliament.\n\n31:17.220 --> 31:19.860\n In fact, yes, let's talk about elections.\n\n31:20.980 --> 31:22.960\n Let's talk about freedom of speech\n\n31:22.960 --> 31:25.220\n and freedom of the public sphere.\n\n31:25.220 --> 31:28.020\n We're not talking about freedom as a slogan here.\n\n31:28.020 --> 31:31.660\n We're talking about a huge array of institutions\n\n31:31.660 --> 31:35.300\n and practices and norms ultimately, right?\n\n31:35.300 --> 31:39.160\n And if they exist, you know, and you live under them.\n\n31:39.160 --> 31:40.420\n And if they don't exist,\n\n31:40.420 --> 31:43.380\n you fully understand that as well, right?\n\n31:43.380 --> 31:48.380\n Ukraine was a flawed democracy before Russia invaded.\n\n31:50.460 --> 31:55.220\n It's utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional,\n\n31:55.220 --> 31:58.500\n especially the elites were dysfunctional.\n\n31:58.500 --> 32:02.500\n The gas industry in Ukraine was absolutely terrible\n\n32:02.500 --> 32:04.620\n because of the corruption that it generated,\n\n32:04.620 --> 32:06.660\n the oligarch problem,\n\n32:06.660 --> 32:10.060\n a handful of people stealing the state resources.\n\n32:10.060 --> 32:13.940\n And yet Ukraine had an open public sphere\n\n32:13.940 --> 32:16.580\n and it had a parliament that functioned.\n\n32:16.580 --> 32:21.580\n And so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy.\n\n32:23.460 --> 32:26.560\n The regime in Moscow, you can't say that Lex.\n\n32:26.560 --> 32:30.480\n It's not a comparable regime to Ukraine.\n\n32:30.480 --> 32:32.920\n You could say, oh, well, there were oligarchs in Ukraine\n\n32:32.920 --> 32:34.480\n and there were oligarchs in Russia.\n\n32:34.480 --> 32:37.200\n There's corruption in Ukraine, there's corruption in Russia.\n\n32:37.200 --> 32:38.960\n So really what's the big difference?\n\n32:38.960 --> 32:43.000\n And the answer is, well, Ukraine had the open public sphere.\n\n32:43.000 --> 32:44.340\n Ukraine had a real parliament.\n\n32:44.340 --> 32:47.680\n Can you call Russia's Duma a real parliament?\n\n32:47.680 --> 32:49.400\n I don't think so.\n\n32:49.400 --> 32:50.920\n I don't think you can.\n\n32:50.920 --> 32:54.080\n Can you say that there were any checks whatsoever\n\n32:54.080 --> 32:57.320\n on the executive branch in Russia?\n\n32:57.320 --> 33:01.360\n Can you say that the Russian judiciary had any independence\n\n33:02.360 --> 33:05.840\n or really full level of competence\n\n33:05.840 --> 33:08.360\n even compared to the Ukrainian judiciary,\n\n33:08.360 --> 33:10.040\n which was nothing to brag about?\n\n33:10.040 --> 33:12.020\n No, you can't say that Lex.\n\n33:12.020 --> 33:16.880\n So we can differentiate between the very flawed,\n\n33:16.880 --> 33:21.880\n corrupt oligarchic democracy in Ukraine\n\n33:21.880 --> 33:26.360\n and the very corrupt oligarchic autocracy in Russia.\n\n33:26.360 --> 33:29.120\n I think that's a fair distinction.\n\n33:29.120 --> 33:32.200\n Yeah, we should say that Russia and Ukraine\n\n33:32.200 --> 33:34.200\n have the great honor of being the number one\n\n33:34.200 --> 33:37.000\n and the number two most corrupt nations in Europe\n\n33:37.000 --> 33:38.640\n by many measures.\n\n33:38.640 --> 33:40.240\n But there is a fundamental difference,\n\n33:40.240 --> 33:42.000\n as you were highlighting.\n\n33:42.000 --> 33:44.640\n Russia is a corrupt autocracy.\n\n33:44.640 --> 33:48.000\n Ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy.\n\n33:48.000 --> 33:52.420\n And to that level, there's a fundamental difference.\n\n33:53.680 --> 33:57.720\n Ukraine is not murdering its own journalists\n\n33:57.720 --> 33:59.720\n in systematic fashion.\n\n33:59.720 --> 34:03.380\n If journalists are killed in Ukraine, it's a tragedy.\n\n34:03.380 --> 34:05.160\n If journalists are killed in Russia\n\n34:05.160 --> 34:07.160\n or Russian journalists are killed abroad,\n\n34:07.160 --> 34:08.640\n it's regime policy.\n\n34:08.640 --> 34:11.520\n And the degree to which a nation is authoritarian\n\n34:12.520 --> 34:15.880\n means that it's suffocating its own spirit,\n\n34:15.880 --> 34:18.320\n its capacity to flourish.\n\n34:19.200 --> 34:24.200\n We're not just talking about sort of the freedom\n\n34:24.960 --> 34:26.820\n of the press, those kinds of things,\n\n34:26.820 --> 34:30.840\n but basically all industries get suffocated\n\n34:30.840 --> 34:33.280\n and you're no longer being able to,\n\n34:33.280 --> 34:36.040\n yeah, flourish as a nation, grow the production,\n\n34:36.040 --> 34:38.280\n the GDP, the scientists, the art, the culture,\n\n34:38.280 --> 34:39.160\n all those kinds of things.\n\n34:39.160 --> 34:40.760\n Yes, Lex, you're absolutely right.\n\n34:40.760 --> 34:45.000\n And so before the invasion, the full blown invasion\n\n34:45.000 --> 34:48.200\n of February 2022 into Ukraine, because as you know,\n\n34:48.200 --> 34:52.040\n the war has been going on for many years at a lower level\n\n34:52.040 --> 34:54.240\n compared to what it is these days,\n\n34:54.240 --> 34:57.320\n but still a tragic war with many deaths\n\n34:57.320 --> 35:00.320\n prior to February 2022.\n\n35:00.320 --> 35:03.140\n Before this latest war, we could have said\n\n35:03.140 --> 35:05.760\n that the greatest victims of the Putin regime\n\n35:05.760 --> 35:10.040\n are Russian, domestic, that the people\n\n35:10.040 --> 35:13.560\n who are suffering the most from the Putin regime\n\n35:13.560 --> 35:16.000\n are not sitting here in New York City,\n\n35:16.000 --> 35:18.820\n but in fact are sitting there in Russia.\n\n35:18.820 --> 35:21.880\n Now, of course, with the invasion of Ukraine\n\n35:21.880 --> 35:26.880\n and really the atrocities that have been well documented\n\n35:28.540 --> 35:30.400\n and more are being investigated,\n\n35:32.080 --> 35:34.940\n we can't easily say anymore that Russians\n\n35:34.940 --> 35:37.280\n are the greatest victims of the Putin regime,\n\n35:38.120 --> 35:43.120\n but in ways other than bombing and murdering civilians,\n\n35:43.120 --> 35:46.760\n children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers,\n\n35:49.160 --> 35:52.440\n after you include that, then of course,\n\n35:52.440 --> 35:55.240\n the larger number of victims of the Putin regime\n\n35:55.240 --> 35:58.240\n are not Ukrainians, but ultimately Russians,\n\n35:58.240 --> 36:00.680\n and there's how many of them now that have fled?\n\n36:02.120 --> 36:07.060\n So your powerful, precise, rigorous words\n\n36:07.060 --> 36:11.800\n are then in a stark contrast, I would say,\n\n36:11.800 --> 36:15.120\n to my very recent conversation with Oliver Stone,\n\n36:15.120 --> 36:18.360\n and I would love you to elaborate this agreement\n\n36:18.360 --> 36:21.420\n you have here with his words and maybe words\n\n36:21.420 --> 36:25.420\n of people like John Mearsheimer.\n\n36:25.420 --> 36:29.520\n The idea is that Putin's hand in this invasion of 2022\n\n36:29.520 --> 36:34.120\n was forced by the expansion of NATO,\n\n36:34.120 --> 36:38.360\n the imperialist imperative of the United States\n\n36:38.360 --> 36:41.800\n and the NATO forces.\n\n36:43.680 --> 36:48.420\n You disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame\n\n36:48.420 --> 36:53.080\n somehow on the invasion on forces larger\n\n36:53.080 --> 36:55.340\n than the particular two nations involved,\n\n36:55.340 --> 36:59.600\n but more on the geopolitics of the world\n\n36:59.600 --> 37:02.160\n that's driven by the most powerful military nation\n\n37:02.160 --> 37:04.280\n in the world, which is the United States.\n\n37:04.280 --> 37:09.280\n Yeah, Lex, so let's imagine that a tragedy's happened here\n\n37:09.680 --> 37:12.400\n in New York, and a woman got raped.\n\n37:13.940 --> 37:15.920\n We know the perpetrator.\n\n37:15.920 --> 37:19.460\n They go to trial, and Oliver Stone gets up and says,\n\n37:19.460 --> 37:20.760\n you know what?\n\n37:20.760 --> 37:23.920\n The woman was wearing a short skirt,\n\n37:23.920 --> 37:28.760\n and there was no option but for the rapist to rape her.\n\n37:28.760 --> 37:31.960\n The woman was wearing lipstick,\n\n37:31.960 --> 37:35.160\n or the woman was applying for NATO membership\n\n37:35.160 --> 37:37.320\n and just had to be raped.\n\n37:37.320 --> 37:41.040\n There's, I mean, didn't want to rape her,\n\n37:41.040 --> 37:44.280\n but was compelled because of what she was doing\n\n37:44.280 --> 37:47.880\n and what she looked like and the clothes she was wearing\n\n37:47.880 --> 37:51.600\n and the alliances that she was under international law\n\n37:51.600 --> 37:54.960\n signed by Moscow, all the treaties\n\n37:54.960 --> 37:57.160\n that sovereign countries get to choose\n\n37:57.160 --> 37:59.300\n whatever alliance they belong to.\n\n37:59.300 --> 38:04.300\n The treaties that the UN Charter signed by Russia,\n\n38:04.820 --> 38:09.820\n Soviet Union, the 1975 Helsinki Agreement\n\n38:11.740 --> 38:13.340\n signed by the Soviet Union,\n\n38:13.340 --> 38:16.340\n the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe\n\n38:16.340 --> 38:17.700\n signed by the Soviet Union,\n\n38:17.700 --> 38:21.300\n the 1997 NATO Russia Founding Act\n\n38:21.300 --> 38:24.500\n signed by the Russian government, the post Soviet Russia.\n\n38:24.500 --> 38:29.500\n All of those documents signed by either the Soviet regime\n\n38:30.540 --> 38:31.620\n or the Russian regime,\n\n38:31.620 --> 38:36.000\n which is the legally recognized international inheritor,\n\n38:36.000 --> 38:38.460\n right, successor of the Soviet state.\n\n38:38.460 --> 38:40.460\n All of those agreements are still in force\n\n38:40.460 --> 38:44.880\n and all of them say that countries are sovereign\n\n38:44.880 --> 38:48.340\n and can freely choose their foreign policy\n\n38:48.340 --> 38:50.860\n and what alliances they want to join.\n\n38:50.860 --> 38:52.660\n Let's even go farther than that.\n\n38:52.660 --> 38:55.340\n I mean, you don't have to go farther than that,\n\n38:55.340 --> 38:57.980\n but let's go farther than that, Lex.\n\n38:57.980 --> 39:01.020\n Is an autocratic repressive regime\n\n39:01.020 --> 39:04.780\n that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security\n\n39:04.780 --> 39:07.000\n something new in Russian history?\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.960\n Did we not see this before?\n\n39:08.960 --> 39:13.540\n Is this, does this not predate NATO expansion?\n\n39:13.540 --> 39:17.160\n Does this not predate the existence of NATO?\n\n39:17.160 --> 39:20.100\n Would Oliver Stone sit here in this chair and say to you,\n\n39:20.100 --> 39:25.100\n you know, they had to impose serfdom in the 17th century\n\n39:25.600 --> 39:27.720\n because NATO expanded.\n\n39:27.720 --> 39:30.060\n They had no choice, their hands were tied.\n\n39:30.060 --> 39:33.520\n They were compelled to treat their own population\n\n39:33.520 --> 39:37.560\n like slaves because, you know, NATO expanded.\n\n39:37.560 --> 39:39.620\n I mean, I could go on through the examples\n\n39:39.620 --> 39:43.520\n of Russian history that predate the existence,\n\n39:43.520 --> 39:46.100\n let alone the expansion of NATO,\n\n39:46.100 --> 39:51.100\n where you have behavior, policies, actions,\n\n39:51.620 --> 39:55.660\n very similar to what we see now from the Kremlin.\n\n39:55.660 --> 39:59.940\n And you can't explain those by NATO expansion, can you?\n\n39:59.940 --> 40:03.600\n And so that argument doesn't wash for me\n\n40:03.600 --> 40:07.620\n because I have a pattern here that predates NATO expansion.\n\n40:07.620 --> 40:10.980\n I have international agreements, founding documents,\n\n40:10.980 --> 40:15.980\n signed by the Kremlin over many, many decades\n\n40:15.980 --> 40:18.460\n acknowledging the freedom of countries\n\n40:18.460 --> 40:20.500\n to choose their alliances.\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:24.120\n And then I have this problem where when you rape somebody,\n\n40:24.120 --> 40:26.860\n it's not because they're wearing a short skirt.\n\n40:26.860 --> 40:29.200\n It's because you have raped them.\n\n40:32.340 --> 40:35.100\n You've committed a criminal act, Lex.\n\n40:35.100 --> 40:38.500\n That's a, I think there's a lot of people listening to this\n\n40:38.500 --> 40:41.420\n that will agree to the emotion, the power,\n\n40:41.420 --> 40:43.420\n and the spirit of this metaphor.\n\n40:43.420 --> 40:46.820\n And I was struggling to think how to dance\n\n40:46.820 --> 40:49.540\n within this metaphor because it feels like\n\n40:49.540 --> 40:51.700\n it wasn't precisely the right one,\n\n40:51.700 --> 40:53.720\n but I think it captures the spirit.\n\n40:55.140 --> 40:58.940\n I'm not suggesting, Lex, that everything the West has done\n\n40:59.860 --> 41:03.020\n has been honorable or intelligent.\n\n41:03.900 --> 41:06.260\n Fortunately, we live in a democracy.\n\n41:06.260 --> 41:07.900\n We live in liberal regimes.\n\n41:07.900 --> 41:10.180\n We live under rule of law,\n\n41:10.180 --> 41:13.460\n liberal in the classical sense of rule of law,\n\n41:13.460 --> 41:15.540\n not liberal in the leftist sense.\n\n41:17.060 --> 41:20.400\n We live in places like that and we can criticize ourselves.\n\n41:20.400 --> 41:22.940\n And we can criticize the mistakes that we made\n\n41:22.940 --> 41:26.820\n or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken.\n\n41:26.820 --> 41:30.580\n And there are a whole lot of things to answer for.\n\n41:30.580 --> 41:35.580\n And you can now discuss the ones that are your favorites,\n\n41:36.780 --> 41:39.380\n the dishonor or the mistakes.\n\n41:39.380 --> 41:42.540\n And I could discuss mine and we could spend\n\n41:42.540 --> 41:44.940\n the whole rest of our meeting today\n\n41:44.940 --> 41:47.260\n discussing the West's mistakes and problems.\n\n41:47.260 --> 41:49.660\n And we won't end up in prison for it.\n\n41:49.660 --> 41:53.540\n Yeah, Lex, and so I'm thankful for that.\n\n41:53.540 --> 41:55.680\n And I'm thankful that people may disagree\n\n41:55.680 --> 41:57.180\n and that people make the argument\n\n41:57.180 --> 41:59.660\n that NATO expansion is to blame.\n\n41:59.660 --> 42:02.820\n But you see, I'm countering two arguments here.\n\n42:02.820 --> 42:04.960\n I'm countering one argument,\n\n42:04.960 --> 42:08.700\n which is very deeply popular, pervasive,\n\n42:08.700 --> 42:13.180\n about how Russia has this cultural tendency to aggression.\n\n42:13.180 --> 42:16.140\n And it can help, but invade its neighbors\n\n42:16.140 --> 42:17.620\n and it does it again and again.\n\n42:17.620 --> 42:21.020\n And it's eternal Russian imperialism\n\n42:21.020 --> 42:23.080\n and you have to watch out for it.\n\n42:23.080 --> 42:26.060\n This very popular argument in the Baltic States,\n\n42:26.060 --> 42:28.500\n it's really popular in Warsaw.\n\n42:28.500 --> 42:31.720\n It's really popular with the liberal interventionists\n\n42:31.720 --> 42:34.380\n and it's very, very popular with those\n\n42:34.380 --> 42:36.620\n who were part of the Iraq war squad\n\n42:36.620 --> 42:39.100\n that got us into that mess.\n\n42:39.100 --> 42:40.660\n So I'm against that.\n\n42:40.660 --> 42:43.500\n And the reason I'm against it is because it's not true.\n\n42:43.500 --> 42:44.760\n It's empirically false.\n\n42:44.760 --> 42:47.560\n There is no cultural trait,\n\n42:47.560 --> 42:50.540\n inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive.\n\n42:50.540 --> 42:53.140\n It's a strategic choice that they make.\n\n42:53.140 --> 42:55.060\n Every time it's a choice made,\n\n42:55.060 --> 42:56.540\n it's not some kind of momentum.\n\n42:56.540 --> 42:59.500\n Every time it's a choice that we should judge\n\n42:59.500 --> 43:01.300\n for the choice that it is for the decision.\n\n43:01.300 --> 43:03.100\n And therefore they could make different choices.\n\n43:03.100 --> 43:06.020\n They could say, we don't have to stand up to the West.\n\n43:06.020 --> 43:08.800\n We don't have the capabilities to do that.\n\n43:08.800 --> 43:10.580\n We can still be a great country.\n\n43:10.580 --> 43:13.180\n We can still be a civilization unto itself.\n\n43:13.180 --> 43:15.140\n We can still be Russia.\n\n43:15.140 --> 43:18.500\n We can still worship in Orthodox cathedrals\n\n43:18.500 --> 43:21.940\n or we can still be ourselves,\n\n43:21.940 --> 43:25.960\n but we don't have to pursue this chimerical pursuit,\n\n43:25.960 --> 43:29.260\n this elusive quest to stand up to the West\n\n43:29.260 --> 43:31.940\n and be in the first ranks of powers.\n\n43:31.940 --> 43:33.420\n So I'm countering that argument.\n\n43:33.420 --> 43:36.820\n I'm saying it's perpetual geopolitics.\n\n43:36.820 --> 43:40.740\n It's a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma\n\n43:40.740 --> 43:44.960\n of the mismatch between aspirations and capabilities.\n\n43:44.960 --> 43:47.980\n It's not eternal Russian imperialism.\n\n43:47.980 --> 43:51.020\n And I'm also countering the other argument here, Lex,\n\n43:51.020 --> 43:53.860\n which is to say that it's the West's fault.\n\n43:53.860 --> 43:56.180\n It's Western imperialism.\n\n43:56.180 --> 43:57.940\n I'm very popular on the left,\n\n43:57.940 --> 44:00.580\n very popular with realist scholars,\n\n44:00.580 --> 44:02.340\n very popular with some of the people\n\n44:02.340 --> 44:04.860\n recently on your podcast.\n\n44:04.860 --> 44:08.420\n And so it's neither eternal Russian imperialism\n\n44:08.420 --> 44:11.260\n nor is it Western imperialism, right?\n\n44:11.260 --> 44:14.700\n The mere fact that the West is stronger than Russia\n\n44:14.700 --> 44:17.900\n is not a crime on the part of the West.\n\n44:17.900 --> 44:21.380\n It's not a crime that countries voluntarily\n\n44:21.380 --> 44:24.300\n wanna join the West, that beg to get in,\n\n44:24.300 --> 44:29.300\n either the EU or NATO or other bilateral alliances\n\n44:29.860 --> 44:31.620\n or other trade agreements.\n\n44:31.620 --> 44:35.860\n Those are voluntarily entered into and that's not criminal.\n\n44:35.860 --> 44:37.780\n If the West's sphere of influence,\n\n44:37.780 --> 44:41.580\n which is open, an open sphere of influence,\n\n44:41.580 --> 44:43.840\n which as I say, people voluntarily join,\n\n44:43.840 --> 44:46.220\n if that expands, that's not a crime,\n\n44:46.220 --> 44:49.740\n nor is that a threat to Russia, ipso facto, right?\n\n44:49.740 --> 44:52.020\n NATO is a defensive alliance\n\n44:52.020 --> 44:54.020\n and the countries are largely pacifists\n\n44:54.020 --> 44:55.660\n who are members of NATO.\n\n44:55.660 --> 44:57.340\n And NATO doesn't attack,\n\n44:57.340 --> 45:00.700\n it defends members if they are attacked.\n\n45:00.700 --> 45:04.380\n And so the idea that Ukraine, which had the legal right,\n\n45:04.380 --> 45:08.340\n might wanna join NATO and the EU,\n\n45:08.340 --> 45:10.980\n which was not gonna happen in our lifetimes\n\n45:10.980 --> 45:13.380\n and was not a direct threat to the Putin regime\n\n45:13.380 --> 45:18.380\n since the Western countries that make up the EU and NATO\n\n45:21.260 --> 45:24.340\n decided that Ukraine was not ready for membership,\n\n45:24.340 --> 45:26.780\n there was no consensus, it was not gonna happen,\n\n45:26.780 --> 45:31.420\n but it's Ukraine's free choice to express that desire.\n\n45:31.420 --> 45:34.300\n And if your government is elected by your people,\n\n45:34.300 --> 45:39.020\n freely elected, meaning you can unelect that government\n\n45:39.020 --> 45:40.820\n in the next election,\n\n45:40.820 --> 45:43.500\n and that government makes foreign policy choices\n\n45:43.500 --> 45:46.960\n on the basis of its perceived interests,\n\n45:46.960 --> 45:50.220\n that's not a crime, Lex, that's not a provocation,\n\n45:50.220 --> 45:52.660\n that's not something that compels the leader\n\n45:52.660 --> 45:55.960\n of another country to invade you, right?\n\n45:55.960 --> 45:59.100\n That is legal under international law,\n\n45:59.100 --> 46:02.100\n and it's also a realist fact of life.\n\n46:02.100 --> 46:06.780\n The realists like to tell you that Russia here\n\n46:06.780 --> 46:10.500\n was disrespected, Russia's interests were not taken\n\n46:10.500 --> 46:12.340\n into account, et cetera, et cetera,\n\n46:12.340 --> 46:15.140\n but the real world works in such a way\n\n46:15.140 --> 46:19.060\n that treaties matter, that international law matters.\n\n46:19.060 --> 46:21.380\n That's why people like me were not in favor\n\n46:21.380 --> 46:25.820\n of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq, Lex,\n\n46:25.820 --> 46:29.240\n because it wasn't legal, in addition to the fact\n\n46:29.240 --> 46:31.100\n that we thought it might backfire.\n\n46:32.020 --> 46:35.420\n But you know, Lex, like I said, there are a lot of things\n\n46:35.420 --> 46:38.900\n about the West that we ought to criticize as citizens,\n\n46:38.900 --> 46:42.660\n and we do criticize, but we have to be clear\n\n46:42.660 --> 46:47.340\n about where responsibility lies in these events\n\n46:47.340 --> 46:48.780\n that we're talking about today.\n\n46:48.780 --> 46:51.940\n So you get into trouble, it's largely erroneous\n\n46:51.940 --> 46:56.140\n to think about both the West or the United States\n\n46:56.140 --> 46:58.500\n from an imperialist perspective and Russia\n\n46:58.500 --> 47:00.340\n from an imperialist perspective.\n\n47:00.340 --> 47:04.000\n It's better, clearer to think about each individual\n\n47:04.000 --> 47:07.380\n aggressive decision on its own as a choice that was made.\n\n47:07.380 --> 47:10.580\n So let's talk about the most recent choice\n\n47:10.580 --> 47:12.220\n made by Vladimir Putin.\n\n47:14.140 --> 47:17.880\n The choice to invade Ukraine, or to escalate\n\n47:17.880 --> 47:22.800\n the invasion of Ukraine on February 24th, 2022.\n\n47:22.800 --> 47:26.820\n Now we're a few months removed from that decision,\n\n47:26.820 --> 47:30.580\n initial decision, why do you think he did it?\n\n47:30.580 --> 47:35.580\n What are the errors in understanding the situation,\n\n47:35.580 --> 47:40.580\n in calculating the outcomes, and everything else\n\n47:40.620 --> 47:42.660\n about this decision in your view?\n\n47:42.660 --> 47:47.660\n Yeah, Lex, when a war doesn't go well,\n\n47:48.140 --> 47:52.380\n it looks like lunacy to have launched it in the first place.\n\n47:52.380 --> 47:54.140\n Does it ever go well?\n\n47:54.140 --> 47:56.820\n War never goes according to plan.\n\n47:56.820 --> 47:59.900\n All war is based upon miscalculation,\n\n47:59.900 --> 48:03.780\n but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation.\n\n48:03.780 --> 48:07.620\n All aggressive war we're talking about, not defensive war,\n\n48:07.620 --> 48:10.140\n is based upon miscalculation.\n\n48:10.140 --> 48:13.660\n But you can adjust, you can recalibrate.\n\n48:13.660 --> 48:15.700\n You know, when you're driving down the road\n\n48:15.700 --> 48:18.420\n and that very annoying voice is telling you\n\n48:18.420 --> 48:23.260\n in a thousand feet, make a right,\n\n48:23.260 --> 48:26.340\n and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right?\n\n48:26.340 --> 48:29.740\n It tells you, okay, now go turn around,\n\n48:29.740 --> 48:31.860\n or U turn, or make a left.\n\n48:31.860 --> 48:33.980\n It doesn't say you're an idiot in turn around\n\n48:33.980 --> 48:37.020\n and make a U turn, but it does recalibrate.\n\n48:37.020 --> 48:39.220\n So you can miscalculate, and the problem\n\n48:39.220 --> 48:41.140\n is not the miscalculation usually,\n\n48:41.140 --> 48:45.420\n it's the failure to do that adjustment, right?\n\n48:45.420 --> 48:49.140\n People I know who are hedge fund traders,\n\n48:50.340 --> 48:52.860\n I ask them, you know, what's your favorite trade?\n\n48:52.860 --> 48:55.260\n And the line from the mall, and this is a cliche,\n\n48:55.260 --> 48:58.940\n is my favorite trade is when I made a mistake,\n\n48:58.940 --> 49:02.660\n but I got out early before all the carnage.\n\n49:02.660 --> 49:04.820\n So their favorite trade is not when they made\n\n49:04.820 --> 49:08.700\n some brilliant choice, but it's when they miscalculated\n\n49:08.700 --> 49:12.100\n but they reduce the consequences of their miscalculation\n\n49:12.100 --> 49:14.820\n by recalibrating quickly, right?\n\n49:14.820 --> 49:16.700\n So let's talk about the calculation\n\n49:16.700 --> 49:19.380\n and miscalculation of February.\n\n49:19.380 --> 49:21.740\n Let's imagine, Lex, that you've been getting away\n\n49:21.740 --> 49:26.460\n with murder, I don't mean murder in a figurative sense.\n\n49:26.460 --> 49:28.780\n I mean, you've been murdering people,\n\n49:28.780 --> 49:30.780\n you've been murdering them domestically,\n\n49:30.780 --> 49:33.820\n and you've been murdering them all across Europe,\n\n49:33.820 --> 49:38.820\n and you've been murdering them not just with, for example,\n\n49:38.820 --> 49:41.820\n a car accident, a staged car accident,\n\n49:41.820 --> 49:44.820\n or using a handgun, you use Novichok,\n\n49:47.700 --> 49:51.860\n or you use some other internationally outlawed\n\n49:51.860 --> 49:53.100\n chemical weapon.\n\n49:54.620 --> 49:56.660\n And let's imagine that you did it\n\n49:56.660 --> 49:58.820\n and nothing happened to you.\n\n49:58.820 --> 50:01.380\n It wasn't like you were removed from power,\n\n50:01.380 --> 50:04.020\n it wasn't like you paid a personal price.\n\n50:04.020 --> 50:06.900\n Sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy,\n\n50:06.900 --> 50:09.620\n but you didn't pay the price of those sanctions.\n\n50:09.620 --> 50:12.620\n Little people paid the price of those sanctions.\n\n50:12.620 --> 50:15.820\n Other people in your country paid the price.\n\n50:15.820 --> 50:19.580\n Let's imagine not only were you murdering people literally,\n\n50:19.580 --> 50:24.580\n but you decided to entice the idiotic ruler of Georgia\n\n50:24.580 --> 50:29.580\n into a provocation that you could then invade the country.\n\n50:30.060 --> 50:31.540\n And you invaded the country\n\n50:31.540 --> 50:33.900\n and you bit off these territories,\n\n50:33.900 --> 50:36.460\n Abkhazia and South Ossetia,\n\n50:36.460 --> 50:38.300\n and what price did you pay for that?\n\n50:39.260 --> 50:41.300\n And then you decided, you know,\n\n50:41.300 --> 50:45.740\n I think I'll now invade Crimea and forcibly annex Crimea,\n\n50:45.740 --> 50:49.700\n and I'll instigate an insurrection in the Donbass\n\n50:49.700 --> 50:51.420\n in Eastern Ukraine.\n\n50:51.420 --> 50:54.660\n In Luhansk. Let's imagine you did all that\n\n50:54.660 --> 50:56.900\n and then you had to stick out your wrist\n\n50:56.900 --> 51:00.940\n so that, you know, it could be slapped a couple of times.\n\n51:00.940 --> 51:04.420\n And you said, you know, I can pretty much do what I want.\n\n51:05.300 --> 51:07.660\n They're putting a sanction here and there\n\n51:07.660 --> 51:09.860\n and they're doing this and they're doing that.\n\n51:09.860 --> 51:11.180\n And you know what?\n\n51:11.180 --> 51:14.180\n They're more energy dependent on me than before.\n\n51:14.180 --> 51:17.260\n I got better money laundering and reputation services\n\n51:17.260 --> 51:18.740\n than anybody had.\n\n51:18.740 --> 51:21.740\n Maybe the Middle East and the Chinese would disagree with you\n\n51:21.740 --> 51:24.340\n that you have better than them, but yours are pretty good.\n\n51:24.340 --> 51:27.220\n And the Panama Papers get released,\n\n51:27.220 --> 51:31.140\n revealing all of your offshoring and your corruption\n\n51:31.140 --> 51:33.500\n and what happened, nothing happens, Lex.\n\n51:33.500 --> 51:36.900\n So the first and most important consideration here is,\n\n51:36.900 --> 51:41.100\n in your own mind, you've been getting away with murder,\n\n51:41.100 --> 51:43.620\n literally, as well as figuratively,\n\n51:43.620 --> 51:44.940\n and you think, you know,\n\n51:44.940 --> 51:47.060\n I probably should have done that.\n\n51:47.060 --> 51:50.380\n You think, you know, I probably can do something again\n\n51:50.380 --> 51:51.460\n and get away with it.\n\n51:52.340 --> 51:55.980\n And so the failure to respond at scale,\n\n51:55.980 --> 51:58.620\n in fact, the indulgences,\n\n51:58.620 --> 52:01.780\n the further dependencies that are introduced,\n\n52:01.780 --> 52:05.580\n the illusion that trade is the mechanism\n\n52:05.580 --> 52:08.340\n to manage authoritarian regimes.\n\n52:08.340 --> 52:11.180\n You know, that great German cliche,\n\n52:11.180 --> 52:16.180\n Wandel durch Handel, right, change through trade\n\n52:16.700 --> 52:18.420\n or transformation through trade,\n\n52:18.420 --> 52:21.980\n one of Angela Merkel's favorite expressions, right?\n\n52:21.980 --> 52:25.660\n You're gonna get the other side to be better\n\n52:26.740 --> 52:31.700\n rather than confront them in a Cold War fashion\n\n52:31.700 --> 52:33.580\n where you stand up to their aggressions\n\n52:33.580 --> 52:35.140\n and you punish them severely\n\n52:35.140 --> 52:37.620\n in order to deter further behavior.\n\n52:37.620 --> 52:39.740\n So that's the first and most important part\n\n52:39.740 --> 52:41.580\n of the calculation, miscalculation.\n\n52:41.580 --> 52:42.940\n There are a lot of other dimensions.\n\n52:42.940 --> 52:44.780\n So can we pause on that really quick?\n\n52:45.780 --> 52:49.740\n So this is kind of idea of it's okay to crack a few eggs\n\n52:49.740 --> 52:53.420\n to make an omelet, which is a more generous description\n\n52:53.420 --> 52:54.660\n of what you're saying,\n\n52:55.580 --> 53:00.260\n that you don't incorporate into the calculation\n\n53:00.260 --> 53:04.020\n the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause,\n\n53:04.020 --> 53:08.620\n but instead you look at sort of the success\n\n53:08.620 --> 53:11.860\n based on some kind of measure for you personally\n\n53:11.860 --> 53:16.860\n and for the nation, not in terms of in a humanitarian sense,\n\n53:17.700 --> 53:19.780\n but in some kind of economic sense\n\n53:19.780 --> 53:22.460\n and a geopolitical power sense.\n\n53:22.460 --> 53:25.580\n Yeah, you're not sentimental, Lex.\n\n53:25.580 --> 53:30.580\n You say to yourself, the cause of Russian greatness\n\n53:31.500 --> 53:34.020\n is greater than any individual life.\n\n53:35.020 --> 53:38.500\n Russia being in the first rank of the great powers,\n\n53:38.500 --> 53:43.500\n Russia realizing its mission to be a special country\n\n53:44.580 --> 53:46.260\n with a special mission in the world,\n\n53:46.260 --> 53:48.260\n a civilization unto itself,\n\n53:49.580 --> 53:51.940\n the first rank of the great powers,\n\n53:51.940 --> 53:53.940\n maybe even the greatest power.\n\n53:53.940 --> 53:58.060\n That's worth the price that we have to pay,\n\n53:58.060 --> 54:00.980\n especially in other people's lives, right?\n\n54:00.980 --> 54:03.820\n We have a lot of literature on the Putin regime,\n\n54:03.820 --> 54:06.700\n which talks about the kleptocracy,\n\n54:06.700 --> 54:10.380\n the place is a kleptocracy, and it is a kleptocracy.\n\n54:11.420 --> 54:15.860\n We all can see that, and anybody in London,\n\n54:15.860 --> 54:19.220\n living the high life, servicing this kleptocracy\n\n54:19.220 --> 54:21.700\n can testify that it's a kleptocracy,\n\n54:21.700 --> 54:23.620\n and not only in London, of course,\n\n54:23.620 --> 54:25.900\n right here in the United States, in New York.\n\n54:27.140 --> 54:30.820\n But you know, it's not only a kleptocracy, Lex.\n\n54:30.820 --> 54:33.900\n That was the problem of the Russian studies literature.\n\n54:33.900 --> 54:37.580\n It wasn't just about stealing, looting the state.\n\n54:37.580 --> 54:39.900\n It was about Russian greatness.\n\n54:39.900 --> 54:43.140\n You see those rituals in the Kremlin,\n\n54:43.140 --> 54:45.460\n right in the Grand Kremlin Palace,\n\n54:45.460 --> 54:47.740\n in the St. George's Hall,\n\n54:47.740 --> 54:50.820\n some of the greatest interiors in the world,\n\n54:50.820 --> 54:55.460\n and you see award ceremonies, and you see marking holidays,\n\n54:55.460 --> 54:57.660\n and all of these looters of the state\n\n54:57.660 --> 55:00.420\n have their uniforms on with their medals,\n\n55:00.420 --> 55:03.060\n and someone's given a speech or singing\n\n55:03.060 --> 55:05.980\n a ballad, and their eyes are moist.\n\n55:07.180 --> 55:11.140\n Their eyes are moist because they're thieves and looters?\n\n55:11.140 --> 55:15.660\n No, Lex, because they believe in Russian greatness.\n\n55:15.660 --> 55:20.660\n They have a deep and fundamental passionate commitment\n\n55:20.660 --> 55:22.700\n to the greatness of Russia,\n\n55:22.700 --> 55:25.420\n which in unsentimental fashion,\n\n55:25.420 --> 55:27.380\n they're all sentimental to the max.\n\n55:27.380 --> 55:30.300\n That's why their eyes are moistening.\n\n55:30.300 --> 55:34.260\n But they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice is okay,\n\n55:34.260 --> 55:36.900\n a sacrifice of other people's lives,\n\n55:36.900 --> 55:40.420\n a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military,\n\n55:40.420 --> 55:44.780\n a sacrifice of Ukrainian women and children and elderly.\n\n55:44.780 --> 55:48.860\n That's a small price to pay for those moist eyes\n\n55:48.860 --> 55:52.340\n about Russian greatness and Russia's position in the world.\n\n55:52.340 --> 55:54.940\n Well, that human thing, that sentimentality,\n\n55:54.940 --> 55:56.180\n is the thing that can get us in trouble\n\n55:56.180 --> 55:58.020\n in the United States as well,\n\n55:58.020 --> 56:01.460\n and lead us to wars, the illegal wars and so on.\n\n56:01.460 --> 56:02.620\n But the United States,\n\n56:02.620 --> 56:07.140\n there's repercussions for breaking the law.\n\n56:07.140 --> 56:09.900\n You're going to pay for illegal wars in the end.\n\n56:09.900 --> 56:13.420\n You're saying that in authoritarian regimes,\n\n56:13.420 --> 56:15.980\n the sentimentality can really get out of hand,\n\n56:15.980 --> 56:17.860\n and you can, by charismatic leaders,\n\n56:17.860 --> 56:21.660\n they can take that to manipulate the populace to make,\n\n56:21.660 --> 56:25.340\n that in the span of history led to atrocities,\n\n56:25.340 --> 56:30.100\n and in today's world, lead to humanitarian crises.\n\n56:30.100 --> 56:33.260\n It's not just the kleptocracy, it's a belief system.\n\n56:33.260 --> 56:35.900\n It's passion, it's conviction.\n\n56:35.900 --> 56:39.380\n It's, you can call them illusions,\n\n56:39.380 --> 56:41.500\n you can call them fantasies,\n\n56:41.500 --> 56:44.140\n whatever you want to call them, they're real.\n\n56:44.140 --> 56:45.860\n They're real for those people.\n\n56:45.860 --> 56:48.960\n And so yes, they're looting that very state\n\n56:48.960 --> 56:50.180\n that they're trying to make\n\n56:50.180 --> 56:52.340\n one of the great powers in the world.\n\n56:52.340 --> 56:55.860\n And they resent the fact that the West\n\n56:55.860 --> 56:58.360\n doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers.\n\n56:58.360 --> 57:01.200\n And they resent that the West is more powerful.\n\n57:01.200 --> 57:05.900\n People talk about how Putin doesn't understand the world\n\n57:05.900 --> 57:08.380\n and that he gets really bad information.\n\n57:08.380 --> 57:10.740\n Lex, if you're sitting there in that Kremlin,\n\n57:11.820 --> 57:14.260\n and you're trying to conduct business in the world,\n\n57:14.260 --> 57:16.940\n and you're getting reports from your finance minister\n\n57:16.940 --> 57:18.700\n or your central bank governor,\n\n57:19.620 --> 57:21.900\n your whole economy, everything that matters,\n\n57:21.900 --> 57:25.980\n somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and euros.\n\n57:27.860 --> 57:29.260\n Do you have any illusions\n\n57:29.260 --> 57:32.740\n about who controls the international financial system?\n\n57:32.740 --> 57:34.920\n I don't think so, Lex.\n\n57:34.920 --> 57:39.520\n You're looking over your industrial plan for the next year,\n\n57:39.520 --> 57:42.340\n and you're looking over how many tanks you're gonna get,\n\n57:42.340 --> 57:44.580\n and how many cruise missiles you're gonna get,\n\n57:44.580 --> 57:46.580\n and how many submarines you're gonna get,\n\n57:46.580 --> 57:49.620\n and fill in the blank.\n\n57:49.620 --> 57:51.180\n And you know what?\n\n57:51.180 --> 57:53.060\n It says right there in the paperwork\n\n57:53.060 --> 57:54.940\n where the component parts come from,\n\n57:54.940 --> 57:56.860\n where the software comes from,\n\n57:56.860 --> 57:59.020\n comes from the West, Lex.\n\n57:59.020 --> 58:01.220\n Your whole military industrial complex\n\n58:01.220 --> 58:04.160\n is dependent on high end Western technology.\n\n58:05.060 --> 58:08.620\n And let's say you're in Beijing, not just in Moscow,\n\n58:08.620 --> 58:11.580\n and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood.\n\n58:11.580 --> 58:13.420\n You're the leader of China.\n\n58:13.420 --> 58:16.860\n You go to a meeting with other Asian leaders.\n\n58:16.860 --> 58:19.900\n Do they all speak in Chinese with you?\n\n58:19.900 --> 58:22.800\n No, Lex, they don't speak Chinese.\n\n58:22.800 --> 58:25.420\n You go to an international meeting as the leader of China,\n\n58:25.420 --> 58:29.080\n and guess what language is the main language of intercourse?\n\n58:29.080 --> 58:31.960\n Yes, the same one you and I are speaking right now.\n\n58:32.980 --> 58:34.740\n And so you live in that world.\n\n58:34.740 --> 58:36.220\n You live in the Western world,\n\n58:36.220 --> 58:38.580\n and it's very hard to have illusions\n\n58:38.580 --> 58:40.580\n about what world you live in.\n\n58:40.580 --> 58:44.260\n When you're under that, you need those Western banks.\n\n58:44.260 --> 58:46.780\n You need that foreign currency, right?\n\n58:46.780 --> 58:48.960\n You need that high end Western technology,\n\n58:48.960 --> 58:51.020\n that technology transfer.\n\n58:51.020 --> 58:53.220\n You're speaking, or you're forced to speak,\n\n58:53.220 --> 58:54.920\n or your minions are forced to speak\n\n58:54.920 --> 58:57.380\n at international gatherings in English.\n\n58:57.380 --> 58:58.600\n And I could go on.\n\n58:58.600 --> 59:01.200\n All the indicators that you live in.\n\n59:01.200 --> 59:02.940\n And so Putin lives in that world.\n\n59:02.940 --> 59:04.460\n He's no fool.\n\n59:04.460 --> 59:07.340\n Well, to push back, isn't it possible that,\n\n59:07.340 --> 59:11.020\n as you said, the minions operate in that world?\n\n59:11.020 --> 59:14.020\n But can't you, if you're the leader of Russia,\n\n59:14.020 --> 59:15.180\n or the leader of China,\n\n59:15.180 --> 59:20.180\n or the leader of these different nations, still put up walls\n\n59:20.700 --> 59:24.620\n where actually when you think in the privacy of your mind,\n\n59:24.620 --> 59:27.540\n you exist not in the international world,\n\n59:27.540 --> 59:30.260\n but in a world where there's this great Russian empire,\n\n59:30.260 --> 59:32.500\n or this great Chinese empire,\n\n59:32.500 --> 59:34.360\n and then you forget that there's English,\n\n59:34.360 --> 59:36.900\n you forget that there's technology and iPhones,\n\n59:36.900 --> 59:41.820\n you forget that there's all this US keeps popping up\n\n59:41.820 --> 59:43.520\n on all different paperwork.\n\n59:43.520 --> 59:46.620\n That just becomes the blurry details that dissipate,\n\n59:46.620 --> 59:51.260\n because what matters is the greatness of this dream empire\n\n59:51.260 --> 59:54.180\n that I have in my mind as a dictator.\n\n59:54.180 --> 59:56.620\n I would put it this way, Lex.\n\n59:56.620 --> 1:00:01.500\n After you absorb all of that from your minions,\n\n1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:06.500\n and it impresses upon your consciousness where you live,\n\n1:00:06.660 --> 1:00:09.500\n you live in a Western dominated world,\n\n1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:12.660\n that the multipolar world doesn't exist.\n\n1:00:12.660 --> 1:00:16.260\n Your goal is to make that multipolar world exist.\n\n1:00:16.260 --> 1:00:19.140\n Your goal is to bring down the West.\n\n1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:21.940\n Your goal is for the West to weaken.\n\n1:00:21.940 --> 1:00:25.980\n Your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro.\n\n1:00:25.980 --> 1:00:28.860\n Your goal is an international financial system\n\n1:00:28.860 --> 1:00:30.220\n that you dominate.\n\n1:00:30.220 --> 1:00:34.140\n Your goal is technological self sufficiency\n\n1:00:34.140 --> 1:00:36.820\n made in China 2035, right?\n\n1:00:36.820 --> 1:00:40.220\n Your goal is a world that you dominate,\n\n1:00:40.220 --> 1:00:42.340\n not that the West dominates.\n\n1:00:42.340 --> 1:00:45.080\n And you're gonna do everything you can\n\n1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:47.660\n to try to attain that world,\n\n1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:49.940\n which is a Russian centric world,\n\n1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:52.180\n or a Chinese centric world,\n\n1:00:52.180 --> 1:00:56.140\n or what we could call a Eurasian centric world.\n\n1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:58.340\n And it's not gonna be easy, Lex,\n\n1:00:58.340 --> 1:01:02.340\n just for the reasons that we enumerated before.\n\n1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:04.780\n But maybe you're gonna get a helping hand.\n\n1:01:04.780 --> 1:01:06.480\n Maybe the West is gonna transfer\n\n1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:07.980\n their best technology to you.\n\n1:01:07.980 --> 1:01:10.700\n They're gonna sell you their best stuff.\n\n1:01:10.700 --> 1:01:13.700\n And then you're gonna absorb it,\n\n1:01:13.700 --> 1:01:16.820\n and maybe copy it, and reverse engineer it.\n\n1:01:16.820 --> 1:01:18.060\n And if they won't sell it to you,\n\n1:01:18.060 --> 1:01:19.760\n maybe you'll just have to steal it.\n\n1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:23.700\n Maybe the West is gonna allow you to bank,\n\n1:01:23.700 --> 1:01:27.740\n even though you violate many laws\n\n1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:29.100\n that would prohibit the West\n\n1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:31.600\n from extending those banking services to you.\n\n1:01:32.540 --> 1:01:35.500\n Maybe the West is gonna buy your energy,\n\n1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:38.240\n and your palladium, and your titanium,\n\n1:01:38.240 --> 1:01:40.460\n and your rare metals like lithium,\n\n1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:44.560\n because you're willing to have your poor people\n\n1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:48.660\n mine that stuff and die of disease at an early age.\n\n1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:51.780\n But Western governments, they don't wanna do that.\n\n1:01:51.780 --> 1:01:53.680\n They don't wanna do that dirty mining\n\n1:01:53.680 --> 1:01:56.460\n of those very important rare earths.\n\n1:01:56.460 --> 1:01:57.580\n But you're willing to do that\n\n1:01:57.580 --> 1:02:00.100\n because it's just people whose lives you don't care about\n\n1:02:00.100 --> 1:02:01.500\n as an autocratic regime, right?\n\n1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:03.460\n So that's the world you live in\n\n1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:07.040\n where you're trying to get to this other world.\n\n1:02:07.040 --> 1:02:09.820\n You're at the center of the other world.\n\n1:02:09.820 --> 1:02:11.200\n You dominate the other world.\n\n1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:13.700\n But the only way to get there, Lex,\n\n1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:18.420\n is the West has to weaken, divide itself,\n\n1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:20.660\n maybe even collapse.\n\n1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:25.120\n And so you're encouraging, to the extent possible,\n\n1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:28.640\n Western divisions, Western disunity,\n\n1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:33.540\n a Western lack of resolve, Western mistakes,\n\n1:02:33.540 --> 1:02:36.660\n and Western invasion of the wrong country,\n\n1:02:36.660 --> 1:02:39.780\n and Western destruction of its credibility\n\n1:02:39.780 --> 1:02:41.980\n through international financial crises,\n\n1:02:41.980 --> 1:02:44.140\n and one could go on.\n\n1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:47.980\n So if the West weakens itself through its mistakes\n\n1:02:47.980 --> 1:02:51.160\n and its own corruption, you're gonna survive\n\n1:02:51.160 --> 1:02:54.380\n and maybe even come out into that world\n\n1:02:54.380 --> 1:02:55.940\n where you're the center.\n\n1:02:55.940 --> 1:02:58.620\n And so Russia's entire grand strategy,\n\n1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:00.500\n just like China's grand strategy,\n\n1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.060\n Iran, it's hard to say they have a grand strategy\n\n1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:06.660\n because they're so profoundly weak.\n\n1:03:06.660 --> 1:03:11.660\n But Russia's grand strategy is, we're a mess.\n\n1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:14.120\n We don't invest in our human capital.\n\n1:03:14.120 --> 1:03:17.860\n Our human capital flees, or we actually drive it out.\n\n1:03:17.860 --> 1:03:21.060\n It goes to MIT, like you did,\n\n1:03:21.060 --> 1:03:23.680\n or it goes to fill in the blank, right?\n\n1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:25.720\n We can't invest in our people.\n\n1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:27.420\n Our healthcare is terrible.\n\n1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:30.560\n Our education system is in decline.\n\n1:03:30.560 --> 1:03:33.300\n We don't build infrastructure, Lex.\n\n1:03:33.300 --> 1:03:35.960\n We don't improve our governance.\n\n1:03:35.960 --> 1:03:39.580\n We don't invest in those attributes of modern power\n\n1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:41.180\n that make the West powerful.\n\n1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:46.140\n We can't because when we try, the money is stolen.\n\n1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:50.300\n We try these grandiose projects of national projects,\n\n1:03:50.300 --> 1:03:51.140\n they're called.\n\n1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:52.340\n We're gonna invest in higher ed.\n\n1:03:52.340 --> 1:03:54.520\n We're gonna invest in high tech.\n\n1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:57.780\n We're gonna build our own Silicon Valley\n\n1:03:57.780 --> 1:03:58.780\n known as Skolkovo.\n\n1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:01.460\n We're gonna do all those things, and what happens?\n\n1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:02.980\n They can't even build an airport\n\n1:04:02.980 --> 1:04:04.740\n without the money disappearing.\n\n1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:06.640\n The Sochi Olympics, Lex,\n\n1:04:08.260 --> 1:04:11.060\n officially cost them $50 billion.\n\n1:04:11.060 --> 1:04:14.220\n You look around at the infrastructure that endured\n\n1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:18.500\n from that $50 billion expense, and you're thinking,\n\n1:04:18.500 --> 1:04:20.940\n that's like the Second Avenue subway.\n\n1:04:20.940 --> 1:04:22.840\n You get almost nothing for your money.\n\n1:04:23.700 --> 1:04:25.860\n And so, yeah, it's corruption, Lex,\n\n1:04:25.860 --> 1:04:28.660\n but it's also because they don't wanna do that.\n\n1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:31.280\n They don't wanna invest in their people.\n\n1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.480\n They couldn't do it if they wanted to,\n\n1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.260\n and when they try, it doesn't work.\n\n1:04:36.260 --> 1:04:38.320\n But why invest in your own people?\n\n1:04:39.180 --> 1:04:43.360\n Invest in your hardware, your military hardware, right?\n\n1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:47.400\n Invest in your cyber capabilities.\n\n1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:51.400\n Invest in all your spoilation techniques and your hard power,\n\n1:04:52.260 --> 1:04:57.260\n and invest in further corrupting, and further weakening,\n\n1:04:57.820 --> 1:05:01.300\n and further dividing the West, because as I said,\n\n1:05:01.300 --> 1:05:05.120\n if the West is weak, divided, lacking resolve,\n\n1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:06.800\n you don't invest in your people,\n\n1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:08.260\n you don't build infrastructure,\n\n1:05:08.260 --> 1:05:09.700\n you don't improve your governance,\n\n1:05:09.700 --> 1:05:11.580\n but you'll muddle through.\n\n1:05:11.580 --> 1:05:13.540\n That's Russian grand strategy.\n\n1:05:13.540 --> 1:05:18.100\n So invest in the hard power, weaken the West.\n\n1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:21.340\n Those combined together means you're going to be\n\n1:05:21.340 --> 1:05:24.500\n heavily incentivized to escalate\n\n1:05:24.500 --> 1:05:28.540\n any military aggressive conflicts that are around you,\n\n1:05:28.540 --> 1:05:30.140\n or create new ones, or just.\n\n1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:32.620\n If you can get away with murder.\n\n1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:34.500\n But what happens, Lex,\n\n1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:37.780\n if it's a Harry Truman like response?\n\n1:05:37.780 --> 1:05:39.500\n What happens if somebody says,\n\n1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:42.060\n you know, we're gonna stand up to this?\n\n1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:45.420\n We're not gonna allow this to happen.\n\n1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:47.760\n We're not gonna launder your money anymore.\n\n1:05:49.060 --> 1:05:52.000\n We're not gonna be dependent on you for energy\n\n1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:54.880\n in the long term, we're gonna make a transition.\n\n1:05:56.100 --> 1:05:59.380\n We're gonna punish you for that kind of behavior instead.\n\n1:05:59.380 --> 1:06:02.860\n And the West is now switched to that\n\n1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:07.860\n only because of the courage\n\n1:06:07.980 --> 1:06:10.820\n and ingenuity of the Ukrainian people.\n\n1:06:10.820 --> 1:06:15.060\n The Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression\n\n1:06:15.940 --> 1:06:20.020\n was one of the greatest gifts the West has ever received.\n\n1:06:20.020 --> 1:06:23.660\n The sacrifices that the Ukrainians are making,\n\n1:06:23.660 --> 1:06:25.360\n right now as we speak,\n\n1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:30.360\n meaning they're fighting a war by themselves\n\n1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:34.780\n against a major military power, their neighbor Russia.\n\n1:06:36.100 --> 1:06:37.840\n Nobody's fighting it with them.\n\n1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:41.260\n Yes, we are giving them weapons\n\n1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:43.220\n so they can conduct self defense,\n\n1:06:43.220 --> 1:06:45.760\n which by the way is legal under international law.\n\n1:06:46.660 --> 1:06:48.060\n Unlike the Russian invasion,\n\n1:06:48.060 --> 1:06:50.960\n which is illegal under international law,\n\n1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:54.180\n Western supply of weapons, including heavy weapons,\n\n1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:56.940\n including offensive weapons to Ukraine\n\n1:06:56.940 --> 1:06:59.860\n for its self defense in the invasion by Russia\n\n1:06:59.860 --> 1:07:01.320\n is actually legal under,\n\n1:07:01.320 --> 1:07:06.320\n and so thank God the Ukrainians surprised everybody.\n\n1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:11.120\n They surprised me, they surprised Putin and the Kremlin,\n\n1:07:11.120 --> 1:07:13.120\n they surprised the Biden administration,\n\n1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.840\n they surprised the European Union,\n\n1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:18.840\n not with the fact that they would resist.\n\n1:07:18.840 --> 1:07:20.400\n We knew that.\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.400\n We had the Orange Revolution in 2004,\n\n1:07:23.400 --> 1:07:26.840\n we had Maidan in 2013, 14,\n\n1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.320\n where they rose up against a domestic tyrant\n\n1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:33.480\n and they were willing to die\n\n1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:35.360\n on behalf of their country then,\n\n1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:37.600\n let alone against a foreign tyrant\n\n1:07:37.600 --> 1:07:39.560\n invading their country, right?\n\n1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:40.840\n So we knew they would resist.\n\n1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:43.000\n We didn't know just how successful,\n\n1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.480\n certainly I didn't know,\n\n1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:46.040\n they would be on the battlefield.\n\n1:07:46.040 --> 1:07:48.240\n It's been breathtaking to watch.\n\n1:07:48.240 --> 1:07:52.400\n That sacrifice, that gift enabled the West\n\n1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:55.800\n to rediscover itself, to rediscover its power,\n\n1:07:55.800 --> 1:07:59.900\n to revive itself, to say to hell with this energy dependence\n\n1:07:59.900 --> 1:08:00.740\n in the long term,\n\n1:08:00.740 --> 1:08:04.180\n to hell with this money laundering and reputation laundering,\n\n1:08:04.180 --> 1:08:07.240\n to hell with this running back and forth to Moscow\n\n1:08:07.240 --> 1:08:09.160\n to try to see what Putin needs\n\n1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:11.600\n in order for him to feel respected,\n\n1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:13.120\n what appeasement he needs, right?\n\n1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.920\n So we'll see if it endures,\n\n1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:20.960\n but this shift comes from the Ukrainians.\n\n1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:23.640\n And so it's no longer getting away with murder, Lex,\n\n1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.640\n and we thank the Ukrainians for that.\n\n1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.680\n The people and the leadership\n\n1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:32.680\n and the separate factions that make up Ukraine uniting,\n\n1:08:33.560 --> 1:08:37.080\n it's the unification, the uniting against the common enemy\n\n1:08:37.080 --> 1:08:40.320\n and standing up before anyone knew\n\n1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:43.140\n that they would be backed by all of these other nations,\n\n1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:45.180\n by this money and all this kind of stuff,\n\n1:08:45.180 --> 1:08:49.160\n standing there, especially with the president Zelensky,\n\n1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:54.160\n where it makes total sense to flee, he stood his ground.\n\n1:08:54.340 --> 1:08:55.180\n And...\n\n1:08:55.180 --> 1:08:56.920\n Let's take that point that you just raised,\n\n1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:58.720\n which is a deep and fundamental point,\n\n1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:00.640\n and I thank you for that.\n\n1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:01.920\n Do you guys hear that?\n\n1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:03.040\n I think that was a compliment.\n\n1:09:03.040 --> 1:09:03.880\n There we go.\n\n1:09:03.880 --> 1:09:05.080\n Let's go.\n\n1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:05.920\n Lex.\n\n1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.120\n Zelensky or unification, what do you say?\n\n1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:08.660\n I'm sitting here in front of you.\n\n1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:09.500\n Thank you.\n\n1:09:09.500 --> 1:09:10.340\n It's an honor.\n\n1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:11.760\n And it's a mutual honor.\n\n1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.020\n So, Ukraine before the war\n\n1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:20.640\n is run by a TV production company, right?\n\n1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:24.480\n You're one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast.\n\n1:09:24.480 --> 1:09:28.640\n There's 20 guys or so running a country the size of Ukraine.\n\n1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:32.320\n And one's a producer and one's like a makeup person\n\n1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:35.040\n and one's a video editor.\n\n1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:38.680\n And they're fantastically talented people\n\n1:09:38.680 --> 1:09:42.120\n if your country is a TV production.\n\n1:09:42.120 --> 1:09:47.120\n So before the war, Zelensky had what, 25% approval rating\n\n1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:50.320\n and he couldn't get much done and it wasn't working.\n\n1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:53.320\n He got elected with 73%, as you know,\n\n1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:56.600\n and then he was down to 20, that's a pretty big drop.\n\n1:09:56.600 --> 1:10:00.060\n And so you're thinking maybe having a major,\n\n1:10:00.060 --> 1:10:05.000\n large size, 40 million plus population European country\n\n1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:09.800\n run by a TV production company is not the best choice.\n\n1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:11.560\n And then what do we see?\n\n1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:16.400\n We see President Zelensky decides to risk his life\n\n1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:18.720\n on behalf of his country, Ukraine.\n\n1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:21.720\n He decides to stay in the capital.\n\n1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:25.620\n He's not gonna flee, they're gonna stay and fight.\n\n1:10:25.620 --> 1:10:27.800\n And he could be killed, he can die.\n\n1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:30.320\n It's a decision where he put his life on the line.\n\n1:10:32.440 --> 1:10:35.820\n Obviously, he's Jewish descent,\n\n1:10:36.720 --> 1:10:40.880\n Russian speaking childhood and upbringing,\n\n1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:44.520\n Russian speaking Jewish descent puts his life on the line\n\n1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.520\n for the country of Ukraine.\n\n1:10:46.520 --> 1:10:49.660\n It's a pretty big message, don't you think?\n\n1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:51.400\n And it's crucial.\n\n1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:54.520\n And it turns out not only that, Lex,\n\n1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.760\n but they're good at TV.\n\n1:10:56.760 --> 1:10:59.000\n They're good at information war.\n\n1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:02.740\n And in a war, it's a TV production company\n\n1:11:02.740 --> 1:11:06.240\n and a TV personality, that's exactly what you want\n\n1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:09.600\n running a country because they're crushing\n\n1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:11.320\n in the information war.\n\n1:11:11.320 --> 1:11:15.440\n And he's spectacular, European Parliament,\n\n1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:18.900\n US Congress, Israeli Parliament.\n\n1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:22.960\n There's no room on Zoom, let alone in person\n\n1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:26.360\n that he can't win over, he's just so effective.\n\n1:11:26.360 --> 1:11:29.680\n You know, this is the first time reality TV\n\n1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:33.360\n has been about reality instead of fake.\n\n1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:37.080\n Reality TV is just this completely fake nonsense.\n\n1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:41.040\n But Zelensky, this is real reality TV.\n\n1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:45.760\n And he means it and the nation is behind him\n\n1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:48.800\n and they're just as courageous and just as ingenious\n\n1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:52.420\n in many ways and it's spectacular.\n\n1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:55.640\n And so, yeah, who saw that coming?\n\n1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:57.720\n I didn't see that coming, Lex.\n\n1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:01.220\n In fact, the Biden, we talk about Putin's miscalculation.\n\n1:12:01.220 --> 1:12:04.040\n The Biden administration, as you alluded to,\n\n1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:06.720\n offered him an exit from the country.\n\n1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:09.280\n They didn't say, you know, you wanna stand and fight,\n\n1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:10.600\n we'll back you.\n\n1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:14.080\n They said, we'll get you out, you wanna come now?\n\n1:12:14.080 --> 1:12:16.840\n And famously, you know that quote, right?\n\n1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:20.680\n What he said about how he doesn't need a ride.\n\n1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:22.720\n Remember that moment?\n\n1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:25.560\n The Biden administration was poised\n\n1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:28.760\n to do another Afghanistan moment.\n\n1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:32.360\n That ignominious exit from Afghanistan\n\n1:12:32.360 --> 1:12:35.000\n was almost what happened in Ukraine\n\n1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:38.320\n when Biden administration offered him\n\n1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:39.880\n that ride out of there.\n\n1:12:39.880 --> 1:12:43.080\n And fortunately, he declined and helped rally\n\n1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.640\n and the people from below also rallied\n\n1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:48.640\n to stop the invader without the presidency\n\n1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:50.880\n and without the government in Ukraine,\n\n1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:53.000\n saving the Biden administration\n\n1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.240\n and the European leaders who latched on.\n\n1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:58.640\n Fortunately, they had the presence of mind\n\n1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:00.400\n to latch onto this gift,\n\n1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:04.480\n this bravery and ingeniousness of Zelensky\n\n1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.400\n and the rest of the Ukrainians and flipped\n\n1:13:07.400 --> 1:13:11.040\n and decided to support Ukraine's resistance,\n\n1:13:11.040 --> 1:13:13.800\n you know, first with 5,000 helmets only\n\n1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:16.720\n as the Germans initially promised\n\n1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:19.600\n and now with really heavy weapons.\n\n1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:22.880\n And so that's something that wasn't foreseen.\n\n1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:24.680\n I certainly didn't foresee that.\n\n1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:28.960\n I foresaw the Ukrainian society being courageous\n\n1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:31.920\n and resisting, but I didn't foresee\n\n1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:35.560\n a television production company being exactly\n\n1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.520\n what you want to run a country in a war,\n\n1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:42.840\n a president Zelensky willing to sacrifice,\n\n1:13:42.840 --> 1:13:45.400\n lay down his life and rallying others\n\n1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:47.240\n in the country to do that.\n\n1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:50.160\n And then the country being so effective,\n\n1:13:50.160 --> 1:13:55.160\n not just at a courage, but at battlefield resistance\n\n1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:56.920\n to the Russian invasion.\n\n1:13:56.920 --> 1:13:59.320\n So I stand corrected by the Ukrainians\n\n1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:03.280\n and I'm ecstatic that I was wrong,\n\n1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:04.480\n that I was proven wrong.\n\n1:14:04.480 --> 1:14:07.320\n And like I said, there's clear factions\n\n1:14:07.320 --> 1:14:09.120\n of the West and the East of Ukraine\n\n1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:11.400\n and here's a person that, like you said,\n\n1:14:11.400 --> 1:14:16.240\n was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage approval\n\n1:14:16.240 --> 1:14:17.720\n in the country before the war\n\n1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:22.160\n and now was able to use in the 90s.\n\n1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:24.800\n He's in the 90% approval rating.\n\n1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.800\n I mean, I think they stopped doing the polling.\n\n1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:33.600\n Once he hit 91% or whatever it was in the previous poll,\n\n1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:35.720\n I think they all understood that for now\n\n1:14:35.720 --> 1:14:38.080\n they didn't need any more polling,\n\n1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:39.640\n that it's pretty clear the nation.\n\n1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:43.320\n So 25% to 90 something percent.\n\n1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:47.120\n And just like the 25% was deserved,\n\n1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:50.600\n the 90 something percent is also deserved, fully deserved.\n\n1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:55.080\n And the question is how that all stabilizes, it feels\n\n1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:58.800\n like this set of events,\n\n1:14:58.800 --> 1:15:02.400\n I may be paying attention to Twitter too much,\n\n1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:07.400\n which is a concern of mine, whether the change I see\n\n1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:11.400\n is just surface level or deep level.\n\n1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:13.760\n But it seems like we're in a new world,\n\n1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:15.720\n that something dramatic has shifted.\n\n1:15:15.720 --> 1:15:20.720\n That this power that's rooted,\n\n1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:25.560\n I mean, in your study of the 20th century,\n\n1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:27.160\n it's so deeply rooted in history,\n\n1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:29.560\n there's this power center of the world\n\n1:15:29.560 --> 1:15:33.560\n is now going to, has been shaken by this event.\n\n1:15:33.560 --> 1:15:37.880\n And how that changes the world is unclear.\n\n1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:40.840\n It's unclear what lesson China learns from watching this,\n\n1:15:40.840 --> 1:15:43.120\n what lesson India learns from watching this.\n\n1:15:43.120 --> 1:15:45.520\n Both nations, as far as you can get polls\n\n1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:49.280\n about Chinese population, but both nations\n\n1:15:49.280 --> 1:15:51.800\n are largely in support of Putin.\n\n1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:55.080\n So Russia, India, and China are still\n\n1:15:55.080 --> 1:15:57.440\n supporting of Putin quietly.\n\n1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:02.440\n I would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, Lex.\n\n1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:06.680\n I think you're right, the feeling that we're\n\n1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:10.560\n in an inflection moment, an inflection point,\n\n1:16:10.560 --> 1:16:12.520\n I think that's widespread.\n\n1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:16.440\n And I think it's widespread for good reason, we might be.\n\n1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:21.440\n But I also share your, let's say, modesty\n\n1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:27.320\n about where it's going and how hard it is\n\n1:16:27.320 --> 1:16:29.560\n to predict where this might go.\n\n1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:33.880\n It's only an inflection point if the trends continue,\n\n1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:36.120\n right, if the trends endure.\n\n1:16:36.120 --> 1:16:38.920\n There are plenty of non inflection points.\n\n1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:41.320\n After 9 11, the whole world rallied\n\n1:16:41.320 --> 1:16:44.880\n around the United States after it was attacked,\n\n1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:48.520\n after the bombing of the towers here in New York City\n\n1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:53.200\n and the hitting of the Pentagon, and that didn't last.\n\n1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:56.600\n It was not really an inflection point, was it?\n\n1:16:56.600 --> 1:16:59.640\n It felt like it might be, but it wasn't.\n\n1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:01.800\n And so this is not a comparable moment\n\n1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:06.560\n in terms of what happened, but it has the feeling\n\n1:17:06.560 --> 1:17:08.120\n that it might be a watershed.\n\n1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:12.400\n And maybe we'll squander it the way we squandered\n\n1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:16.800\n the post 9 11, rallying around the United States.\n\n1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:21.280\n Maybe we'll actually consolidate it and it'll endure,\n\n1:17:21.280 --> 1:17:24.000\n or maybe it'll endure despite ourselves.\n\n1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.760\n And we can't tell and we can't know yet.\n\n1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.520\n And it depends in part on what we do and what we don't do.\n\n1:17:30.520 --> 1:17:33.280\n But here's a few things that we understand already.\n\n1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:38.280\n One, the idea that the West was in decline\n\n1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:43.000\n and that the rest of the world had risen\n\n1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.040\n and was more powerful and that we lived\n\n1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.800\n in a multipolar world, that turns out\n\n1:17:47.800 --> 1:17:49.440\n to be empirically false.\n\n1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.440\n It's not true.\n\n1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:54.240\n I mean, it's just factually not true.\n\n1:17:55.240 --> 1:17:59.920\n There are no major important multinational institutions,\n\n1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:04.400\n organizations that are run on behalf of,\n\n1:18:04.400 --> 1:18:09.400\n or led by a South African, a Nigerian, person from India.\n\n1:18:11.400 --> 1:18:14.880\n Even the Chinese don't run these institutions.\n\n1:18:14.880 --> 1:18:18.000\n They would like to and they're trying, but they don't.\n\n1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:23.560\n And so whatever you pick, the IMF, the World Bank,\n\n1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:27.320\n the Federal Reserve, which is the most powerful\n\n1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:30.080\n multinational institution, which is actually\n\n1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:33.080\n only a domestic institution and doesn't have\n\n1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:37.440\n a legal mandate to act multilaterally, but does.\n\n1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:41.040\n It's got the most power of any institution in the world.\n\n1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:45.720\n NATO, the bilateral alliances that the US has\n\n1:18:45.720 --> 1:18:50.720\n up and down Asia, what organizations\n\n1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:54.800\n that have tremendous leverage on the international system,\n\n1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.480\n on the international order, are non Western.\n\n1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:04.360\n The UN is the most encompassing.\n\n1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:07.440\n And of course we know that it has five members\n\n1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:10.160\n of the Security Council with a veto,\n\n1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:12.480\n one of which is Russia, one of which is China,\n\n1:19:12.480 --> 1:19:16.000\n and the others are the US, Britain, and France,\n\n1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:21.000\n not India, not South Africa, not Indonesia,\n\n1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.840\n Indonesia, not all of these other countries\n\n1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:25.920\n where the people live, right?\n\n1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:28.400\n The bulk of the population of the world\n\n1:19:28.400 --> 1:19:30.160\n and where the population is growing\n\n1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.240\n like on the African continent.\n\n1:19:32.240 --> 1:19:34.560\n So it's not a multipolar world.\n\n1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:38.040\n We talked already about the international financial system.\n\n1:19:38.040 --> 1:19:40.320\n That's the Western, not multipolar.\n\n1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:42.760\n We talked about the US military and NATO,\n\n1:19:42.760 --> 1:19:45.080\n or we could talk about the Japanese military,\n\n1:19:45.080 --> 1:19:50.040\n which is just very formidable, enormous number of platforms.\n\n1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:51.680\n Even the Australian military\n\n1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:54.160\n we could talk about, Lex, right?\n\n1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:57.680\n And so it's a Western dominated world.\n\n1:19:57.680 --> 1:20:01.440\n And the West, remember, is not a geographic concept.\n\n1:20:01.440 --> 1:20:05.720\n It is an institutional and values club.\n\n1:20:06.560 --> 1:20:10.000\n The Japanese are not European, but they're Western.\n\n1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.160\n Just like Russia is European, but not Western.\n\n1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:16.800\n Because European is a cultural category\n\n1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:19.600\n and Western is an institutional category\n\n1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:22.600\n where you have rule of law and separation of powers\n\n1:20:22.600 --> 1:20:24.160\n and free and open public sphere\n\n1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:28.240\n and dynamic open market economy, okay.\n\n1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.360\n And then we have another thing which is pretty clear.\n\n1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:34.960\n The West is powerfully resented,\n\n1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:39.480\n powerfully envied and admired simultaneously.\n\n1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:43.160\n P.J. O Rourke, the comedian who died this year,\n\n1:20:44.840 --> 1:20:48.400\n fantastic, it was a big loss for the culture.\n\n1:20:48.400 --> 1:20:49.920\n He said, there are two things\n\n1:20:49.920 --> 1:20:51.760\n that are always characteristic\n\n1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:53.920\n of any American embassy abroad.\n\n1:20:54.840 --> 1:20:58.480\n One is a political protest outside\n\n1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:03.520\n and the other is the longest line you've ever seen for visas.\n\n1:21:05.360 --> 1:21:08.640\n And those things are true simultaneously.\n\n1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.400\n And that's the world we live in,\n\n1:21:10.400 --> 1:21:12.920\n meaning that non Western countries\n\n1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:17.440\n envy and admire the West,\n\n1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.760\n but they also resent the power of the West.\n\n1:21:20.760 --> 1:21:23.000\n Western hypocrisy, right?\n\n1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:26.920\n The West invades countries when it wants,\n\n1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:30.440\n but when others do that, it's illegal, right?\n\n1:21:30.440 --> 1:21:35.440\n The West arrests you for money laundering,\n\n1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.960\n but it's Western money laundering\n\n1:21:37.960 --> 1:21:41.760\n that is where you go when you need to launder money, right?\n\n1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:44.400\n So they see the hypocrisy,\n\n1:21:44.400 --> 1:21:48.520\n they see the excessive power that the West has\n\n1:21:48.520 --> 1:21:50.560\n and they resent it.\n\n1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:55.200\n And they say, who elected you to run the world?\n\n1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:58.480\n We have a billion plus people\n\n1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:02.520\n or we have a 200 plus million people\n\n1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:04.920\n and we don't have a say.\n\n1:22:04.920 --> 1:22:08.480\n You're the self appointed guardians of our world,\n\n1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:09.480\n who did that?\n\n1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:11.560\n And so it's incumbent on the West\n\n1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:15.400\n not only to remember the power that it has,\n\n1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:20.800\n but also to exercise that power legally and with restraint\n\n1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:26.680\n and also to think about how we can expand institutions\n\n1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:29.440\n to be more encompassing\n\n1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:31.280\n so that other parts of the world\n\n1:22:31.280 --> 1:22:36.040\n are not on the outside being dictated to,\n\n1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:39.440\n but instead are on the inside.\n\n1:22:39.440 --> 1:22:44.440\n Too often, right, Western power is not consultative\n\n1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:49.760\n in a decision making fashion.\n\n1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:52.640\n It's consultative after the fact.\n\n1:22:52.640 --> 1:22:54.880\n Okay, you know, we got together in the EU\n\n1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:57.240\n or we got together in NATO\n\n1:22:57.240 --> 1:22:59.560\n or we got together at the Federal Reserve\n\n1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:02.720\n and here's our decision and we're announcing it today.\n\n1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:06.320\n And so your economy gets destroyed\n\n1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.000\n because the Federal Reserve decides\n\n1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:09.680\n it has to raise interest rates\n\n1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:14.400\n or you now go into default.\n\n1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:15.600\n You can't pay your debt\n\n1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:18.280\n because Western banks lent you money\n\n1:23:18.280 --> 1:23:21.600\n and now the West has changed interest rates\n\n1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:26.600\n or other considerations and you're in big trouble now.\n\n1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:32.160\n And so this is something which we fail to address.\n\n1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:33.440\n It's very hard to address.\n\n1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:36.920\n It's very hard to reform international institutions.\n\n1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:39.800\n It's very hard to share power.\n\n1:23:39.800 --> 1:23:43.120\n It's very hard to acknowledge that you have too much power\n\n1:23:44.120 --> 1:23:47.800\n and that maybe having too much power is not good,\n\n1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:51.160\n not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself.\n\n1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:53.680\n And so it's great to rediscover the West\n\n1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:55.440\n and rediscover its values\n\n1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:00.440\n and rediscover its authority and credibility and power,\n\n1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.920\n but that's not sufficient.\n\n1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:04.600\n So we know this now.\n\n1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:07.240\n We know that the rest of the world\n\n1:24:07.240 --> 1:24:11.280\n is not necessarily jumping on the Western bandwagon\n\n1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:14.880\n to condemn Russia for its actions\n\n1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:17.960\n because the West can do things like\n\n1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:22.560\n sanction your central bank, take away your reserves,\n\n1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:24.520\n deny you technology.\n\n1:24:24.520 --> 1:24:27.080\n It pretty much can do whatever it wants\n\n1:24:27.080 --> 1:24:28.680\n and it can say that it's legal\n\n1:24:28.680 --> 1:24:30.720\n and it can go through various mechanisms\n\n1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.800\n and it can freeze your property.\n\n1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:34.840\n And you say to yourself,\n\n1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.280\n should anybody have that much power?\n\n1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.360\n And when do they come after me?\n\n1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:42.480\n Now there's a caveat here.\n\n1:24:42.480 --> 1:24:47.240\n And the caveat, Lex, is they don't like the West\n\n1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:49.160\n having all of that power\n\n1:24:49.160 --> 1:24:53.920\n and they didn't join in the condemnation of Russia,\n\n1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:57.320\n but they also didn't join in Russia's aggression.\n\n1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:02.320\n So Russia's domestic civilian aerospace,\n\n1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:07.960\n aircraft industry, civilian aircraft industry\n\n1:25:07.960 --> 1:25:09.240\n is in big trouble now\n\n1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:14.240\n because of the export controls on spare parts and software.\n\n1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:20.920\n Brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing.\n\n1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:23.320\n Did they rush in and say,\n\n1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:28.320\n you know, Vladimir Putin, we didn't condemn necessarily\n\n1:25:28.840 --> 1:25:31.920\n your actions in Ukraine, okay, that's one thing.\n\n1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:36.200\n And how about we give you all of our aircraft technology\n\n1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:40.280\n and we help you rebuild your domestic aircraft industry.\n\n1:25:40.280 --> 1:25:42.520\n And you can have the aviation at the West,\n\n1:25:42.520 --> 1:25:44.160\n did that happen, Lex?\n\n1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:46.080\n Didn't happen.\n\n1:25:46.080 --> 1:25:48.640\n And you can look at India and you can look at China\n\n1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:50.040\n and you can look at South Africa\n\n1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:52.480\n and you can look at what they've done in practice\n\n1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:54.920\n and what they've done in practical terms.\n\n1:25:55.920 --> 1:25:58.600\n Yes, they haven't always joined\n\n1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:00.480\n in a full throated condemnation.\n\n1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:01.920\n Maybe they've been neutral\n\n1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:05.000\n or maybe they've been playing both sides of the fence\n\n1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:06.640\n like Turkey, for example.\n\n1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:12.240\n But are they rushing in to join Russia,\n\n1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:15.000\n to join Russia's aggression, to supply?\n\n1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:16.720\n And the answer is no.\n\n1:26:16.720 --> 1:26:19.680\n And the answer is no for two reasons.\n\n1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:22.760\n One, they actually don't wanna be party to that.\n\n1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:26.200\n And two, they understand that Western power.\n\n1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:29.320\n And they don't wanna be on the receiving end\n\n1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:33.000\n by crossing the West and then getting caught up\n\n1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.640\n in a sanctions regime or worse.\n\n1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:37.760\n Can we go to the mind of Vladimir Putin\n\n1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:42.400\n because what you just said, China, India,\n\n1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:45.680\n they seem to sit back and say,\n\n1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:47.760\n we're not going to condemn the actions\n\n1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:49.880\n of Vladimir Putin in Russia,\n\n1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:52.600\n but we would really like for this war to be over.\n\n1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:55.480\n So there's that kind of energy\n\n1:26:55.480 --> 1:26:58.120\n of we don't just stop this\n\n1:26:58.120 --> 1:27:00.560\n because you're putting us in a very, very bad position.\n\n1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:05.120\n And yet Vladimir Putin is continuing the aggression.\n\n1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:06.480\n What is he thinking?\n\n1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.600\n What information is he getting?\n\n1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:10.760\n Is it the system that you've described\n\n1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:13.120\n of authoritarian regimes that corrupts\n\n1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.760\n your flow of information,\n\n1:27:14.760 --> 1:27:17.960\n your ability to make clearheaded decisions\n\n1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:21.640\n just as a human being when you go to sleep at night?\n\n1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:24.080\n Is he not able to see the world clearly\n\n1:27:24.080 --> 1:27:27.520\n or is this all deliberate systematic action\n\n1:27:27.520 --> 1:27:31.240\n that does have some reason behind it?\n\n1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:33.280\n We gotta talk a little bit about China too,\n\n1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:36.240\n but let's answer your Putin question directly.\n\n1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:41.000\n So on Twitter, you've lost the war.\n\n1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:45.080\n Or as they say, there are these two Russian soldiers\n\n1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:46.920\n having a smoke in Warsaw,\n\n1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:51.000\n and they're taking a break, having a smoke,\n\n1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.480\n and they're sitting there in Warsaw on top of their tank\n\n1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:55.040\n and one says to the other,\n\n1:27:55.040 --> 1:27:57.360\n yeah, we lost the information war.\n\n1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:00.840\n And there they are sitting in Warsaw\n\n1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:02.200\n having that smoke, right?\n\n1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.040\n So yeah, on Twitter, Russia has completely lost the war.\n\n1:28:07.040 --> 1:28:09.520\n In reality, they failed to take Kiev.\n\n1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:11.640\n They failed to capture Kiev.\n\n1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:15.800\n And they failed in phase two, as they called it,\n\n1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.800\n or plan B, which is to capture the entirety of the Donbass.\n\n1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:23.440\n We're three months into the war.\n\n1:28:23.440 --> 1:28:25.800\n If you had made a judgment about, let's say,\n\n1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:27.840\n the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union,\n\n1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:30.440\n a definitive judgment after three months,\n\n1:28:30.440 --> 1:28:32.840\n you might've got the outcome wrong there.\n\n1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:34.680\n If you had judged the Winter War,\n\n1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:39.680\n the 1939, 40 Soviet invasion of Finland after three months,\n\n1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:41.520\n you would've got that wrong too\n\n1:28:41.520 --> 1:28:43.040\n of what the outcome was gonna be.\n\n1:28:43.040 --> 1:28:45.480\n So we're early in the game here,\n\n1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:49.840\n and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments.\n\n1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:54.120\n But it is the case that so far, they failed to take Kiev\n\n1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:57.560\n and they failed to capture the entirety of the Donbass,\n\n1:28:57.560 --> 1:29:01.960\n Luhansk and Donetsk provinces, Eastern Ukraine,\n\n1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.560\n a part of Eastern Ukraine.\n\n1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:08.960\n And they've been driven out of Kharkiv\n\n1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:12.520\n and the area immediately surrounding Kharkiv.\n\n1:29:13.400 --> 1:29:15.600\n They never captured Kharkiv, but they came close,\n\n1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:19.480\n but now the Ukrainians drove them back to the Russian border\n\n1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:22.000\n in that very large and important region.\n\n1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:25.280\n So those look like battlefield losses\n\n1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:28.760\n that are impossible to explain away\n\n1:29:28.760 --> 1:29:30.240\n if you're the regime in Russia,\n\n1:29:30.240 --> 1:29:32.480\n except by suppression of information.\n\n1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:36.080\n And as you know from Russian history, Lex,\n\n1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.720\n leaders in Russia have an easier time\n\n1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:44.360\n with the state of siege and deprivation\n\n1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:46.640\n than they do with explaining a lost war.\n\n1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:52.960\n But let's look at some other facts\n\n1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:55.040\n that are important to take into account.\n\n1:29:56.200 --> 1:30:00.160\n One, the Russian army has penetrated farther\n\n1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:04.280\n into Ukrainian territory since February, 2022,\n\n1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:08.320\n including in Kherson region,\n\n1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:12.960\n the famous Mariupol siege that just ended.\n\n1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:18.880\n They have built a large presence\n\n1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:25.120\n in areas north of Crimea on the Sea of Azov,\n\n1:30:25.960 --> 1:30:28.560\n the Black Sea littoral ultimately\n\n1:30:28.560 --> 1:30:30.400\n that they didn't previously hold.\n\n1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:35.160\n They're still fighting in Luhansk for full control\n\n1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:38.480\n over at least half of the Donbass\n\n1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:41.360\n and Ukrainians are resisting fiercely.\n\n1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:46.360\n But nonetheless, you can say that they've been driven out\n\n1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:50.320\n on the contrary, farther penetration than the beginning.\n\n1:30:51.440 --> 1:30:53.560\n Ukraine doesn't have an economy anymore.\n\n1:30:54.640 --> 1:30:58.320\n They have somewhere between 33 and 50% unemployment.\n\n1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:02.560\n It's hard to measure unemployment in a war economy,\n\n1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:04.160\n but their metallurgical industry,\n\n1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:09.160\n that Azov style steel plant in Mariupol is a ruin now.\n\n1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:14.000\n And a lot of farmers are not planting the fields\n\n1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.080\n because the harvest from the previous year\n\n1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:19.400\n still hasn't been sent, sold abroad\n\n1:31:19.400 --> 1:31:22.400\n because the ports are blockaded or destroyed.\n\n1:31:24.320 --> 1:31:26.080\n And so you don't have an economy\n\n1:31:26.080 --> 1:31:28.760\n and you need 5 billion or 7 billion\n\n1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:33.280\n or $8 billion a month to meet your payroll,\n\n1:31:34.760 --> 1:31:37.760\n to feed your people, to keep your army in the field.\n\n1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:42.960\n That's a lot of money per month and that's indefinite.\n\n1:31:42.960 --> 1:31:45.960\n That's as long as this blockade lasts.\n\n1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:49.200\n And so you don't have an economy anymore, you're indigent.\n\n1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:51.960\n And even if you take the lower number, 5 billion,\n\n1:31:51.960 --> 1:31:55.600\n as opposed to Zelensky's ask for 7 billion,\n\n1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:57.880\n 5 billion is 60 billion a year.\n\n1:31:57.880 --> 1:32:01.680\n That's 60 billion this year, that's 60 billion next year.\n\n1:32:01.680 --> 1:32:03.520\n And so who's got that kind of money?\n\n1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:06.320\n Which Western taxpayers are ready?\n\n1:32:06.320 --> 1:32:08.080\n And if you use the 7 or 8 billion,\n\n1:32:08.080 --> 1:32:10.440\n you get up to 100 billion a year.\n\n1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:15.440\n The Biden just signed, President Joe Biden just signed\n\n1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:22.200\n the bill making it law, $40 billion in aid to Ukraine.\n\n1:32:22.200 --> 1:32:25.320\n It's just an enormous sum.\n\n1:32:25.320 --> 1:32:28.280\n The economic piece of that is a month and a half,\n\n1:32:28.280 --> 1:32:33.280\n two months of Ukrainians covering Ukrainian expenditures.\n\n1:32:35.200 --> 1:32:36.240\n That's it.\n\n1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:37.920\n And they're asking the G7,\n\n1:32:37.920 --> 1:32:39.760\n they're asking everybody for this.\n\n1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:43.920\n So you have no economy and no prospect of an economy\n\n1:32:43.920 --> 1:32:46.480\n until you evict the Russians from your territory.\n\n1:32:46.480 --> 1:32:51.480\n And then you have a Western unity, Western resolve,\n\n1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:55.160\n it lasts or it doesn't last, Lex.\n\n1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:57.120\n So you're President Putin,\n\n1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:00.480\n and you've got more territory than before,\n\n1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:04.640\n and you've got a stranglehold over the Ukrainian economy,\n\n1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:09.080\n and you've got a lot of the world neutral,\n\n1:33:09.080 --> 1:33:12.200\n and you've got the Chinese propaganda\n\n1:33:12.200 --> 1:33:16.640\n supporting you to the hilt with those Oliver Stone\n\n1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:20.960\n and Mearsheimer lines about how this is really NATO's fault.\n\n1:33:22.440 --> 1:33:26.960\n And you've got Hungary dragging its feet\n\n1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:29.280\n on the oil embargo against Russia,\n\n1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:31.360\n and you've got Turkey dragging its feet\n\n1:33:31.360 --> 1:33:35.160\n on the recent applications of Sweden and Finland\n\n1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:37.760\n for NATO expansion, and you're saying to yourself,\n\n1:33:37.760 --> 1:33:39.520\n Lex, maybe I can ride this out.\n\n1:33:39.520 --> 1:33:41.480\n I got a lot of problems of my own,\n\n1:33:41.480 --> 1:33:42.760\n and we can go into the details\n\n1:33:42.760 --> 1:33:45.000\n on the Russian side's challenges,\n\n1:33:45.880 --> 1:33:50.880\n but he's on Ukrainian territory unless he's evicted,\n\n1:33:51.640 --> 1:33:54.320\n and he's got a stranglehold on their economy,\n\n1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:58.400\n and he's got the possibility that the West\n\n1:33:58.400 --> 1:34:02.240\n doesn't stay resolved and doesn't continue to pay\n\n1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:06.200\n for Ukraine's economy or supply those heavy weapons.\n\n1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:09.880\n And so you could argue that maybe he's deluded\n\n1:34:09.880 --> 1:34:13.200\n about all of this, and maybe he should go on Twitter.\n\n1:34:13.200 --> 1:34:15.040\n You know, I'm not on Twitter, but maybe Putin,\n\n1:34:15.040 --> 1:34:16.760\n who famously doesn't use the internet,\n\n1:34:16.760 --> 1:34:19.600\n should go on Twitter and see he's losing the war.\n\n1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:23.280\n Or you can argue that maybe he's calculating here\n\n1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:25.440\n that he's got a chance to still prevail.\n\n1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:31.880\n Wow, that is darkly insightful.\n\n1:34:31.880 --> 1:34:36.560\n If I could go to Henry Kissinger for a brief moment,\n\n1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.760\n and people should read this op ed he wrote\n\n1:34:39.760 --> 1:34:43.240\n in the Washington Post in March 5th, 2014,\n\n1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.040\n after the start of the war between Russia and Ukraine,\n\n1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.480\n but before Crimea was annexed.\n\n1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:54.040\n There's a lot of interesting historical description\n\n1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.280\n about the division within Ukraine,\n\n1:34:56.280 --> 1:34:59.640\n the corruption within Ukraine that will,\n\n1:34:59.640 --> 1:35:03.320\n if people read this article, will give context\n\n1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:06.840\n to how incredible it is, what Zelensky was able\n\n1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:08.440\n to accomplish in uniting the country.\n\n1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:12.040\n But I just want to comment because Henry Kissinger\n\n1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:14.920\n is an interesting figure in American history.\n\n1:35:14.920 --> 1:35:17.800\n He opens the article with, in my life,\n\n1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:21.240\n I have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm\n\n1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:24.360\n and public support, all of which we did not know\n\n1:35:24.360 --> 1:35:27.000\n how to end, and from three of which\n\n1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.760\n we withdrew unilaterally.\n\n1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:34.760\n The test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins.\n\n1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:38.480\n So he's giving this cold, hard truth\n\n1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:43.480\n that we go into wars excited, are able to send $40 billion,\n\n1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:50.000\n financial aid, military aid, our own men and women,\n\n1:35:50.440 --> 1:35:55.440\n but the excitement fades, Twitter outrage fades,\n\n1:35:55.440 --> 1:36:00.440\n and then a country that's willing to wait patiently\n\n1:36:00.800 --> 1:36:04.360\n is willing to pay the cost of siege\n\n1:36:04.360 --> 1:36:07.440\n versus the cost of explaining to its own people\n\n1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:12.440\n that the war is lost, that country just might win, outlast.\n\n1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.480\n Let's hope not because the Ukrainians,\n\n1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.320\n resistance deserves to prevail here.\n\n1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:23.480\n Russia deserves to lose.\n\n1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.240\n No war of aggression like they've committed here\n\n1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:28.760\n against Ukraine should prevail\n\n1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:30.760\n if we can do anything about it.\n\n1:36:30.760 --> 1:36:35.760\n I support 1,000% the continued supply of heavy weapons,\n\n1:36:37.120 --> 1:36:40.640\n including offensive weapons, to the Ukrainians\n\n1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:44.480\n as long as they're willing to resist, and it's their choice.\n\n1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:46.720\n It's their choice when to negotiate.\n\n1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:48.680\n It's their choice how much to resist.\n\n1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:51.440\n It's their choice what kind of sacrifices to make,\n\n1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:56.440\n and it's our responsibility to meet their requests\n\n1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:00.760\n more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale.\n\n1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:05.200\n But ultimately, wars only have political ends.\n\n1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:07.640\n They never have military ends.\n\n1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:10.320\n You need a political solution here.\n\n1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:14.280\n So if the Ukrainians are able to conduct\n\n1:37:14.280 --> 1:37:17.880\n a successful counteroffensive at scale\n\n1:37:17.880 --> 1:37:22.880\n in July or August, whenever they launch,\n\n1:37:23.600 --> 1:37:26.520\n right now the heavy weapons are coming in\n\n1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:28.800\n and they're being moved to the battlefield\n\n1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:31.560\n and more are coming, you know, the dynamic.\n\n1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:35.720\n Russia bombs a school, Russia bombs a hospital.\n\n1:37:35.720 --> 1:37:37.800\n Americans and Europeans decide\n\n1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:40.560\n to send even more heavy weapons to Ukraine, right?\n\n1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:43.880\n That's the self defeating dynamic from the Russian side.\n\n1:37:43.880 --> 1:37:48.360\n They commit the atrocities, we send more heavy weapons.\n\n1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:51.800\n Once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines,\n\n1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:55.000\n we'll see if Ukrainians cannot just defend,\n\n1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.160\n which they've proven they're able to do\n\n1:37:57.160 --> 1:38:02.160\n in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct counterattacks\n\n1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:04.720\n where the enemy moves forward\n\n1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:07.760\n and you cut behind the enemy's lines\n\n1:38:07.760 --> 1:38:11.400\n and you counterattack and push the enemy back a little bit,\n\n1:38:11.400 --> 1:38:15.800\n but whether you can evict the Russians\n\n1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:20.400\n from your territory with a combined arms operation\n\n1:38:20.400 --> 1:38:22.880\n where you have a massive superiority\n\n1:38:22.880 --> 1:38:25.400\n in infantry and heavy weapons,\n\n1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.360\n but more importantly, you coordinate your air power,\n\n1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:33.840\n your tanks, your drones, your infantry at scale,\n\n1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:36.400\n which is something the Ukrainians have not done yet.\n\n1:38:36.400 --> 1:38:39.360\n It's something the Russians failed at in Ukraine\n\n1:38:39.360 --> 1:38:42.880\n and they come from the same place, the Soviet military.\n\n1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:46.000\n We hope this Ukrainian counter offensive at scale,\n\n1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:50.320\n this combined arms operation succeeds.\n\n1:38:50.320 --> 1:38:51.640\n And if it does succeed,\n\n1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:55.160\n there's the possibility of a battlefield victory.\n\n1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:57.400\n Whether that also includes Crimea,\n\n1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:02.720\n which as you know is not hostile on the contrary\n\n1:39:02.720 --> 1:39:06.920\n to the Russian military remains to be seen.\n\n1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:11.640\n But however much they regain territorially\n\n1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:15.520\n back towards the 1991 borders,\n\n1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:18.000\n which is their goal, their stated goal,\n\n1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:22.360\n and which we support them properly in trying to achieve,\n\n1:39:22.360 --> 1:39:24.120\n however much they achieve of that\n\n1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:27.320\n in this counter offensive that we're anticipating,\n\n1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:31.000\n that will set the stage for the next phase.\n\n1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.560\n And either Russia, which is to say one person,\n\n1:39:35.560 --> 1:39:40.560\n Vladimir Putin, will acknowledge that he's lost the war\n\n1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.320\n because the Ukrainians won it on the battlefield,\n\n1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:49.320\n or he'll try to announce a full scale mobilization,\n\n1:39:49.920 --> 1:39:53.400\n conscript the whole country, go back,\n\n1:39:53.400 --> 1:39:55.440\n and instead of acknowledging defeat,\n\n1:39:55.440 --> 1:39:57.040\n try to win with a different plan,\n\n1:39:57.040 --> 1:40:00.320\n recalibrate, remains to be seen.\n\n1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:03.920\n Will the Ukrainians negotiate any territory away\n\n1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:07.440\n or must they capture also Crimea,\n\n1:40:07.440 --> 1:40:12.440\n which puts a very high bar on the summer counter offensive\n\n1:40:13.120 --> 1:40:15.360\n that we're gonna see, which could last through the fall\n\n1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:17.520\n and into the winter as a result.\n\n1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:18.880\n We don't know the answers to that,\n\n1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:20.960\n nobody knows the answers to that.\n\n1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:23.760\n People are guessing, some people are better informed\n\n1:40:23.760 --> 1:40:26.360\n because they have inside intelligence.\n\n1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:32.600\n People are also worried about Russian escalation\n\n1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.880\n to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons\n\n1:40:34.880 --> 1:40:38.320\n if they begin to lose on the battlefield to Ukraine.\n\n1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:40.680\n Are you worried about nuclear war,\n\n1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:43.760\n the possibility of nuclear war?\n\n1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:49.000\n I think it's necessary to pay attention to that possibility.\n\n1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:54.000\n That possibility existed before the February 2022\n\n1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:57.240\n full blown invasion of Ukraine.\n\n1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:00.320\n The doomsday arsenal that Russia possesses\n\n1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:03.480\n is enough to destroy the world many times over,\n\n1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:06.440\n and that's been the case every year\n\n1:41:06.440 --> 1:41:10.240\n since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\n1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:13.920\n And so, of course, we're concerned about that.\n\n1:41:13.920 --> 1:41:15.720\n We do know, however, Lex,\n\n1:41:15.720 --> 1:41:18.480\n that they have a system known as dual key,\n\n1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.440\n dual key for their strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.400\n Strategic nuclear weapons means the ones fired from silos,\n\n1:41:28.400 --> 1:41:32.320\n the missiles, the ones delivered from bombers,\n\n1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:34.440\n or the ones fired from submarines, right?\n\n1:41:34.440 --> 1:41:35.840\n And they're ready to go.\n\n1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.720\n They're intercontinental.\n\n1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:40.480\n We watch that very, very closely.\n\n1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:44.440\n We watch all the movement of that and the alerts, et cetera.\n\n1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:47.160\n We have tremendously, let's say,\n\n1:41:48.280 --> 1:41:51.120\n tremendous inside intelligence on that.\n\n1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.800\n But dual key means that President Putin alone\n\n1:41:53.800 --> 1:41:55.400\n cannot fire them.\n\n1:41:55.400 --> 1:41:57.840\n He has one key, which he must insert,\n\n1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:02.840\n he must then insert the codes for a command to launch.\n\n1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:07.600\n That then goes to the head of the general staff,\n\n1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:11.560\n who must, he has his own key and separate codes,\n\n1:42:11.560 --> 1:42:12.720\n and must do the same,\n\n1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:15.360\n insert that key and codes for them to launch.\n\n1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:21.080\n And so will the general staff chief go along\n\n1:42:21.080 --> 1:42:22.960\n with the destruction of the world\n\n1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:25.160\n over a battlefield loss in Ukraine?\n\n1:42:25.160 --> 1:42:26.720\n I don't know the answer to that,\n\n1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:29.080\n and I don't know if anybody knows the answer to that.\n\n1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:32.160\n Will those people flying those bombers,\n\n1:42:32.160 --> 1:42:33.640\n if they get the order from,\n\n1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:36.760\n if the dual key system goes into action\n\n1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:41.760\n and both keys are used and all the codes are implemented,\n\n1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:45.520\n will those young guys flying those bombers\n\n1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:47.280\n let those bombs go?\n\n1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:52.280\n Will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire?\n\n1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:55.280\n We don't know, but you can see that it's more than one man\n\n1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:57.120\n making the decision here\n\n1:42:57.120 --> 1:43:00.200\n in a system of strategic nuclear weapons.\n\n1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:03.640\n As far as the tactical, the so called low yield\n\n1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:06.440\n or battlefield nuclear weapons,\n\n1:43:06.440 --> 1:43:10.120\n we're not sure the system that they have in Russia these days\n\n1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:12.200\n for their implement, for their use\n\n1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:14.680\n of such tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n1:43:15.560 --> 1:43:20.560\n It could well be that Putin and just himself,\n\n1:43:20.560 --> 1:43:25.560\n himself, he alone can fire them or order them be fired.\n\n1:43:27.760 --> 1:43:31.120\n What you know, Lex, there's no tactical nuclear weapon\n\n1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:35.280\n fired at Ukraine that's not also fired simultaneously\n\n1:43:35.280 --> 1:43:36.120\n at Russia.\n\n1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:42.000\n If the Kremlin is 600 miles from Ukraine\n\n1:43:43.360 --> 1:43:46.080\n and if the wind changes direction\n\n1:43:46.080 --> 1:43:51.000\n or the wind happens to be blowing east, northeast,\n\n1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:54.480\n the fallout hits your Kremlin, not just Ukraine.\n\n1:43:55.440 --> 1:43:58.000\n Moreover, you have all those border regions\n\n1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.720\n which are staging regions for the Russian offensive\n\n1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:04.160\n and they're a lot closer than 600 miles.\n\n1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:06.280\n They're actually right there.\n\n1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:09.560\n And so you fire that weapon on Ukrainian territory\n\n1:44:09.560 --> 1:44:11.880\n and you can get the fallout\n\n1:44:11.880 --> 1:44:16.200\n just like the Chernobyl fallout spread to Sweden\n\n1:44:16.200 --> 1:44:20.480\n which is how we got the Kremlin to finally,\n\n1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:22.040\n first they denied this at all.\n\n1:44:22.040 --> 1:44:25.280\n We don't know why there's a big nuclear cloud over Sweden.\n\n1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:26.960\n We don't know where that came from\n\n1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:28.600\n but eventually they admitted it.\n\n1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:33.400\n So Russia can actually use a nuclear weapon\n\n1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:35.880\n tactical battlefield one in Ukraine\n\n1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:38.960\n without also firing it at itself.\n\n1:44:38.960 --> 1:44:41.120\n And in addition, it's that same dynamic\n\n1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:42.960\n I alluded to earlier\n\n1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:46.520\n which is to say you bomb a hospital,\n\n1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:50.560\n you bomb a school, there's more heavy weapons\n\n1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:52.600\n going to Ukraine from the west.\n\n1:44:52.600 --> 1:44:55.080\n You can't get away with any of the,\n\n1:44:55.080 --> 1:44:56.520\n there's always going to be a response\n\n1:44:56.520 --> 1:44:59.160\n that's either proportional or greater than proportional.\n\n1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:02.880\n You could well have Europe signing on\n\n1:45:02.880 --> 1:45:05.200\n to NATO direct engagement,\n\n1:45:05.200 --> 1:45:09.080\n both Washington and Brussels direct engagement\n\n1:45:09.080 --> 1:45:13.160\n of the Russian army on the territory of Ukraine.\n\n1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:15.040\n You think that's possible to do that\n\n1:45:15.040 --> 1:45:19.320\n without dramatic escalation from the Russian side?\n\n1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:21.080\n Yes, I do think it's possible\n\n1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:24.240\n but it's very worrisome just like you're saying.\n\n1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:28.240\n But if Putin were to escalate like that,\n\n1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:31.240\n he's firing that weapon at himself\n\n1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:34.560\n and he's potentially provoking a direct clash\n\n1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:36.400\n with NATO's military,\n\n1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:39.240\n not just with the Ukrainian military.\n\n1:45:39.240 --> 1:45:40.800\n If you're sitting in the Kremlin\n\n1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:45.400\n looking at those charts, Lex, of NATO capabilities\n\n1:45:46.360 --> 1:45:48.520\n and you can't conquer Ukraine\n\n1:45:48.520 --> 1:45:50.400\n which didn't really have heavy weapons\n\n1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:54.280\n before February 2022 at scale\n\n1:45:55.240 --> 1:45:58.080\n and you're thinking, okay, now I'm gonna take on NATO,\n\n1:45:59.640 --> 1:46:03.960\n that would be a bold step on the part of a Russian leader.\n\n1:46:03.960 --> 1:46:06.240\n And let's also remember, Lex,\n\n1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:07.920\n that there's another variable here.\n\n1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.960\n You're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders.\n\n1:46:16.040 --> 1:46:20.440\n And so if people start to say quietly,\n\n1:46:20.440 --> 1:46:24.880\n not necessarily publicly, I may not implement that order\n\n1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:27.320\n because that's maybe a criminal order\n\n1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:32.320\n or my grandma is Ukrainian or my wife is Ukrainian\n\n1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:35.560\n or I don't wanna go to the hog.\n\n1:46:36.520 --> 1:46:38.640\n I don't wanna spend the rest of my life in the hog\n\n1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:40.320\n or whatever it might be.\n\n1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:43.280\n At any point along the chain of command\n\n1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:46.920\n from the general staff all the way down, right,\n\n1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:49.680\n to the platoon, you're a despot\n\n1:46:49.680 --> 1:46:52.760\n provided they implement your orders.\n\n1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:57.760\n But who's to say that somewhere along the chain of command\n\n1:46:57.760 --> 1:47:02.760\n people start to say, I'm gonna ignore that order\n\n1:47:03.120 --> 1:47:05.800\n or I'm gonna sabotage that order\n\n1:47:05.800 --> 1:47:09.000\n or I'm gonna flee the battlefield\n\n1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:12.960\n or I'm gonna injure myself so that I don't have to fight\n\n1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:16.520\n or I'm gonna join the Ukrainian side.\n\n1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:19.520\n And so it could be that's what's left\n\n1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:24.440\n of the Russian army in the field begins to disintegrate.\n\n1:47:24.440 --> 1:47:27.920\n Even if the Ukrainians are not able to mount that\n\n1:47:27.920 --> 1:47:31.680\n counter offensive at scale, that combined arms operation,\n\n1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:34.840\n the Russian military in the field,\n\n1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.800\n which has taken horrendous casualties\n\n1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:39.320\n as far as we understand, something like a third\n\n1:47:39.320 --> 1:47:44.320\n of the original force, so you're talking about 50 to 60,000\n\n1:47:45.720 --> 1:47:49.000\n that includes both dead and wounded to the point\n\n1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.800\n of being unable to return to the battlefield.\n\n1:47:51.800 --> 1:47:53.680\n Those are big numbers.\n\n1:47:53.680 --> 1:47:57.600\n Those were a lot of families, a lot of families affected.\n\n1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:02.480\n Their sons or their husbands or their fathers\n\n1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.720\n are either missing in action or the regime won't tell them\n\n1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:08.560\n that they're dead, as you know from the sinking\n\n1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:13.560\n of that flagship, Moskva, right, by the Ukrainians.\n\n1:48:15.240 --> 1:48:18.440\n And so a disintegration of the Russian military\n\n1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.800\n because there are orders that they either can't implement\n\n1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:26.800\n or don't wanna implement is also not excluded.\n\n1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:29.200\n And so you have these two big variables,\n\n1:48:29.200 --> 1:48:32.000\n the Ukrainian army in the field and its ability\n\n1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:35.280\n to move from defense to offense at scale,\n\n1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:37.320\n and we're gonna test that soon.\n\n1:48:37.320 --> 1:48:41.280\n And then the Russian ability in the field to hold together\n\n1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:44.920\n in a war of conquest and aggression\n\n1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:49.640\n where they're conscripts or they're fed dog food\n\n1:48:49.640 --> 1:48:53.040\n or they don't have any weapons anymore\n\n1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:55.800\n because there's no resupply,\n\n1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:59.160\n so the disintegration of the army can't be excluded.\n\n1:48:59.160 --> 1:49:02.800\n And then, of course, all bets are off on the Putin regime.\n\n1:49:02.800 --> 1:49:07.800\n More long term, there are these technology export controls.\n\n1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:10.720\n We were talking about how the military industrial complex\n\n1:49:10.720 --> 1:49:15.160\n in Russia is dependent on foreign component parts\n\n1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:19.400\n and software, and so if you have export controls\n\n1:49:19.400 --> 1:49:21.320\n and you have firms voluntarily,\n\n1:49:21.320 --> 1:49:24.200\n even when they don't fall under export controls,\n\n1:49:24.200 --> 1:49:27.320\n leaving Russian business, refusing to do business\n\n1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:31.640\n with Russia, and we see this not just in the civilian sector\n\n1:49:31.640 --> 1:49:35.320\n like with McDonald's or many other companies,\n\n1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:40.320\n we see this in the key areas like the oil industry\n\n1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:42.040\n with the executives fleeing,\n\n1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:45.480\n that is the Western executives fleeing,\n\n1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:47.800\n giving up their positions.\n\n1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:51.640\n So Russia's ability to resupply its tanks,\n\n1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:56.640\n resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms,\n\n1:49:58.040 --> 1:50:01.840\n resupply its food to its soldiers in the field\n\n1:50:01.840 --> 1:50:05.880\n and in their boots, we see a lot of stuff\n\n1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:08.960\n under tremendous stress, and in the long term,\n\n1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:12.680\n there's no obvious way they can rebuild\n\n1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:17.680\n the military industrial complex to produce those weapons\n\n1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:20.000\n because they're reliant on foreign parts\n\n1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.240\n that they can't get anymore,\n\n1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.840\n and there are no domestic substitutes\n\n1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:26.120\n on the immediate horizon.\n\n1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:30.600\n That's at the earliest a two year proposition\n\n1:50:30.600 --> 1:50:32.280\n to have domestic substitutes,\n\n1:50:32.280 --> 1:50:35.360\n and for some things like microelectronics,\n\n1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:37.320\n they've never had domestic substitutes\n\n1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:40.680\n going back to the Soviet times as you know well.\n\n1:50:40.680 --> 1:50:43.920\n And so there's that pressure on Russia\n\n1:50:43.920 --> 1:50:46.760\n from the technology export controls,\n\n1:50:46.760 --> 1:50:49.760\n which if you're in the security ministry\n\n1:50:49.760 --> 1:50:51.080\n or the defense ministry,\n\n1:50:51.080 --> 1:50:54.360\n if you're in that side of the regime,\n\n1:50:54.360 --> 1:50:56.960\n you're feeling that pain as we speak,\n\n1:50:56.960 --> 1:50:59.040\n and you're wondering about the strategy.\n\n1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:06.480\n Let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history,\n\n1:51:06.480 --> 1:51:08.200\n and it frustrates me in part\n\n1:51:08.200 --> 1:51:10.440\n when people draw these parallels,\n\n1:51:10.440 --> 1:51:14.160\n but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels.\n\n1:51:14.160 --> 1:51:18.800\n So there's a song that goes,\n\n1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:21.280\n Dvata Teroviy Uniya Rovnovshchitya Chisa\n\n1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:24.640\n Kiev by Bitya Nama Bitya Shtanochilai Svaina.\n\n1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:29.640\n So Operation Barbarossa, the bombing of Kiev by Hitler,\n\n1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:34.320\n there is sort of an eerie parallel,\n\n1:51:34.320 --> 1:51:37.320\n and you have to be extremely careful\n\n1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:42.000\n drawing such parallels and such connections\n\n1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:47.000\n to this unexplainable war that is World War II.\n\n1:51:50.400 --> 1:51:55.400\n But is there elements of this that do echo\n\n1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.800\n in the actions of Vladimir Putin?\n\n1:51:58.800 --> 1:52:03.720\n And more specifically, do you think that Vladimir Putin\n\n1:52:03.720 --> 1:52:04.880\n is a war criminal?\n\n1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:09.520\n Can that label be assigned to the actions of this man?\n\n1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:14.560\n A war criminal is a legal determination,\n\n1:52:14.560 --> 1:52:17.840\n and it requires evidence and due process\n\n1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:20.200\n and the ability to defend oneself.\n\n1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:24.880\n We don't just decide in the Twittersphere\n\n1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:27.640\n or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal.\n\n1:52:28.800 --> 1:52:31.680\n They can be a suspected war criminal,\n\n1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:36.000\n and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute that case.\n\n1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:39.000\n And then the issue for us, Alexis,\n\n1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:40.680\n which court does it go to?\n\n1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:44.120\n What's the appropriate place?\n\n1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:46.680\n Does it happen in Ukraine because they're the victims?\n\n1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:47.920\n Does it happen in the Hague\n\n1:52:47.920 --> 1:52:51.160\n because there's an international criminal court there?\n\n1:52:51.160 --> 1:52:52.920\n Does it happen inside Russia\n\n1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:56.000\n because there's regime change at some point?\n\n1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:59.280\n And some of these people become,\n\n1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:02.760\n let's say they get arrested by their own people\n\n1:53:02.760 --> 1:53:03.680\n inside Russia.\n\n1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:07.080\n So those are all important questions\n\n1:53:07.080 --> 1:53:09.480\n that have to be pursued with resources\n\n1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:13.720\n and with determination and by skilled people\n\n1:53:13.720 --> 1:53:17.000\n who are excellent at gathering that evidence.\n\n1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:18.880\n And that process is underway.\n\n1:53:18.880 --> 1:53:22.040\n And Ukraine has a trial underway now\n\n1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:26.560\n of one alleged war criminal who's pleaded guilty.\n\n1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:29.400\n And we'll see what the outcome of that trial\n\n1:53:29.400 --> 1:53:31.920\n inside Ukraine is of a lower level official,\n\n1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:34.800\n not obviously Vladimir Putin,\n\n1:53:34.800 --> 1:53:36.680\n but the commander of a tank group.\n\n1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:43.760\n So, yes, the names are eerily familiar.\n\n1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:51.320\n Izium, Kharkiv, Kiev, right?\n\n1:53:51.320 --> 1:53:55.760\n Those are the names we know from the Nazi invasion\n\n1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:58.560\n and the Nazi occupation of Ukraine.\n\n1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:03.080\n And it's very deeply troubling\n\n1:54:03.080 --> 1:54:05.080\n to think that this could happen again.\n\n1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:10.560\n And there's a bizarre sense that the Russians\n\n1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:14.760\n claiming as Putin says to deNazify Ukraine\n\n1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:19.280\n have invaded the same places that the Nazis invaded\n\n1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:21.920\n back in 1941.\n\n1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:24.560\n As somebody who's working on volume three\n\n1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:30.480\n of your work on Stalin going through this period,\n\n1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:32.200\n is it eerie to you?\n\n1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:33.520\n Yes, it is, Lex.\n\n1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:34.640\n That you're.\n\n1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:37.560\n I've written the chapters of volume three.\n\n1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:39.720\n I've drafted the chapters on the war.\n\n1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:43.680\n And as I said, the place names\n\n1:54:43.680 --> 1:54:45.920\n are very evocative, unfortunately.\n\n1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.840\n But, you know, the Nazis failed ultimately.\n\n1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:57.200\n They captured Ukraine for a time,\n\n1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:00.400\n but they were evicted from Ukraine.\n\n1:55:00.400 --> 1:55:05.400\n There was massive partisan or guerrilla warfare resistance\n\n1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.800\n behind Nazi lines the whole time\n\n1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:13.000\n that they were allegedly in control of Ukraine.\n\n1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.200\n If you look at the maps on cable TV,\n\n1:55:15.200 --> 1:55:17.200\n they show you the sign of,\n\n1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:19.840\n they show you the coloring, Russian control.\n\n1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:22.360\n And they draw a line and then it's colored in.\n\n1:55:22.360 --> 1:55:24.640\n But the word control is misplaced.\n\n1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:27.080\n They don't actually control it.\n\n1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:30.360\n It's Russian claimed or extent\n\n1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:34.600\n of farthest Russian troop advancement.\n\n1:55:34.600 --> 1:55:37.480\n Because behind the Russian lines in Ukraine,\n\n1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:40.960\n Crimea accepted, you have insurgencies.\n\n1:55:40.960 --> 1:55:43.320\n You have the armed insurgency.\n\n1:55:43.320 --> 1:55:45.520\n In Melitopol, for example,\n\n1:55:45.520 --> 1:55:49.200\n which is a place that you know in Southeastern Ukraine,\n\n1:55:50.320 --> 1:55:53.440\n there is a guerrilla war now underway\n\n1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:57.800\n to hurt the Russians who are in occupation\n\n1:55:57.800 --> 1:55:59.240\n of that city and region.\n\n1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:02.680\n And we're gonna see that continue\n\n1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:06.560\n even if the war becomes a stalemate,\n\n1:56:07.440 --> 1:56:09.720\n even if it stalemates more or less\n\n1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:11.880\n at the lines we're at now,\n\n1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:15.160\n which would mean that anticipated\n\n1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:19.440\n Ukrainian counteroffensive at scale proves unsuccessful.\n\n1:56:19.440 --> 1:56:21.880\n The Russian army doesn't disintegrate.\n\n1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:25.720\n And you end up with a stalemate\n\n1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.400\n where there could be a ceasefire or not a ceasefire,\n\n1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:30.560\n but neither side is attempting an offensive\n\n1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:32.440\n for the time being.\n\n1:56:32.440 --> 1:56:36.320\n There will be resistance behind those Russian lines\n\n1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:38.680\n and it will be fierce resistance.\n\n1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:42.200\n The kind of resistance we saw to the Nazi occupation.\n\n1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:46.320\n Ultimately, it took the Red Army\n\n1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:50.480\n reinvading the territory of Ukraine\n\n1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:55.480\n and succeeding at combined arms operations at scale.\n\n1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:57.880\n A massive counteroffensive,\n\n1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:01.160\n much larger than anything we're talking about today.\n\n1:57:01.160 --> 1:57:02.760\n Ultimately, it required that\n\n1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:05.520\n to evict the Nazis from Ukraine.\n\n1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:08.800\n But in the meantime, they did not have an easy occupation\n\n1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:09.720\n regime there.\n\n1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:16.680\n Ukrainian partisans, Soviet partisans\n\n1:57:17.040 --> 1:57:22.040\n killed Nazi officials, Wehrmacht soldiers, Wehrmacht officers\n\n1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:27.560\n blew up the infrastructure they were using,\n\n1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:30.880\n made them pay a price for their occupation.\n\n1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:34.880\n We could well see if unfortunately\n\n1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:38.160\n this ends in a stalemate for the time being,\n\n1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:41.400\n we could well see that type of insurgency\n\n1:57:41.400 --> 1:57:43.880\n gain momentum behind Russian lines\n\n1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.040\n and try to evict the Russians that way\n\n1:57:49.280 --> 1:57:52.600\n and then remount the counteroffensive at scale\n\n1:57:52.600 --> 1:57:57.520\n later on in the future if the first one doesn't succeed.\n\n1:57:57.520 --> 1:58:01.000\n So that would be further echoes\n\n1:58:01.000 --> 1:58:03.040\n of the World War II experience.\n\n1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:05.840\n The scale once again is much smaller.\n\n1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:08.120\n The size of the armies here,\n\n1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:13.120\n they're not in the many 800,000, 700,000,\n\n1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:15.360\n a million two, a million four.\n\n1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:18.040\n That's not what we're talking about today.\n\n1:58:18.040 --> 1:58:23.040\n But the weapons, the cruise missiles, artillery fire.\n\n1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:27.320\n Artillery fire used to be very inaccurate\n\n1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:29.400\n and it was like saturation.\n\n1:58:29.400 --> 1:58:31.880\n You would just fire towards the enemy lines\n\n1:58:31.880 --> 1:58:33.520\n and if you hit something, you hit something\n\n1:58:33.520 --> 1:58:36.000\n and if you didn't, you just kept firing.\n\n1:58:36.880 --> 1:58:39.520\n Now you have drones, Lex.\n\n1:58:39.520 --> 1:58:43.000\n And so artillery fire is now sniper fire\n\n1:58:44.080 --> 1:58:46.000\n because you can coordinate the direction\n\n1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.520\n of the artillery fire with the drones.\n\n1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:52.240\n The drones can take a picture and show you\n\n1:58:52.240 --> 1:58:55.400\n where the enemy is precisely located\n\n1:58:55.400 --> 1:58:58.840\n and you can align that artillery to hit them\n\n1:58:58.840 --> 1:59:02.200\n instead of just indiscriminately bombing an area,\n\n1:59:02.200 --> 1:59:03.920\n a territory.\n\n1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:08.320\n And the NATO supplied artillery goes really far\n\n1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:11.520\n and you can fire into Russian positions\n\n1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.200\n and yourself not be exposed to Russian fire\n\n1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:20.200\n because your artillery fires farther than theirs.\n\n1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:24.640\n So that's coming and we're gonna see that in action.\n\n1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:27.520\n And so the scale is not the same,\n\n1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:30.520\n but the weapons, the precision of some of the weapons\n\n1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:31.640\n and some of the NATO.\n\n1:59:31.640 --> 1:59:34.000\n We're not sending all of our stuff,\n\n1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:37.480\n but as I said, the dynamic is Russia commits atrocities,\n\n1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:40.240\n Russia bombs schools, Russia bombs hospitals,\n\n1:59:40.240 --> 1:59:44.840\n Russia kills civilians and more and heavier\n\n1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:48.960\n and more lethal Western weapons go to Ukraine.\n\n1:59:48.960 --> 1:59:53.560\n Their willingness to risk their lives is really so impressive\n\n1:59:53.560 --> 1:59:58.160\n and the reason that it's our duty,\n\n1:59:58.160 --> 2:00:00.720\n we're obliged to supply those weapons.\n\n2:00:00.720 --> 2:00:03.560\n And so the Russians don't have that resupply\n\n2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:05.000\n and the Ukrainians do.\n\n2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:09.280\n And so the Russians are now digging in Lex.\n\n2:00:09.280 --> 2:00:12.040\n They're digging in deeply in the areas\n\n2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:14.280\n that they've penetrated\n\n2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:17.280\n and they're trying to build unassailable positions\n\n2:00:18.800 --> 2:00:21.960\n for when the Ukrainians transition\n\n2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:26.440\n from mostly defense to full scale offense.\n\n2:00:26.440 --> 2:00:28.320\n And we'll see if that now,\n\n2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:31.360\n I mean, they're digging everywhere,\n\n2:00:31.360 --> 2:00:34.720\n as they say, Kapayut, Kapayut, right?\n\n2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:36.400\n They're digging everywhere behind.\n\n2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:37.680\n Your Russian is beautiful.\n\n2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:41.200\n Digging in, I wish Lex, like yours.\n\n2:00:41.200 --> 2:00:44.720\n But so there are these things that we can't predict,\n\n2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:46.320\n but there are these things we're watching\n\n2:00:46.320 --> 2:00:47.620\n and watching closely.\n\n2:00:47.620 --> 2:00:52.620\n And on top of that, something that's not in World War II\n\n2:00:53.380 --> 2:00:56.260\n or for the most part is cyber attacks and cyber warfare,\n\n2:00:56.260 --> 2:01:01.260\n which is much less perhaps convertible into human words\n\n2:01:05.300 --> 2:01:08.300\n because it happens so quickly, it's such large scales,\n\n2:01:08.300 --> 2:01:10.440\n so difficult to trace and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:14.540\n It's not bullets, it's electrical signals and that.\n\n2:01:14.540 --> 2:01:18.460\n Yeah, but those Ukrainian people, they're like you, Lex.\n\n2:01:18.460 --> 2:01:23.060\n They're young and they're technically really proficient.\n\n2:01:23.060 --> 2:01:25.020\n And they've been amazing.\n\n2:01:25.020 --> 2:01:28.500\n You know, they spent those teenage years in the basement\n\n2:01:28.500 --> 2:01:30.580\n playing video games.\n\n2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:31.420\n Nothing.\n\n2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:32.780\n Turns out it's useful after all.\n\n2:01:32.780 --> 2:01:34.980\n It turns out it's more than useful.\n\n2:01:34.980 --> 2:01:37.600\n You can save your country that way.\n\n2:01:37.600 --> 2:01:41.180\n And so they're not alone, they're getting support\n\n2:01:41.180 --> 2:01:43.420\n and that support is important,\n\n2:01:43.420 --> 2:01:46.300\n but really predominantly it's Ukrainians\n\n2:01:46.300 --> 2:01:48.300\n on the cyber battlefield.\n\n2:01:48.300 --> 2:01:50.380\n And their skills have been very impressive\n\n2:01:50.380 --> 2:01:53.340\n and they've been preparing for this for a number of years.\n\n2:01:53.340 --> 2:01:58.340\n And they have a whole army of young people on the cyber side.\n\n2:01:58.580 --> 2:02:00.360\n It's their civilian population.\n\n2:02:00.360 --> 2:02:02.780\n These are not people conscripted into the military\n\n2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:05.940\n or volunteering wearing the uniform.\n\n2:02:05.940 --> 2:02:07.980\n And so even in cyber warfare,\n\n2:02:07.980 --> 2:02:11.460\n the Ukrainians have been extremely impressive.\n\n2:02:11.460 --> 2:02:16.460\n And so let's remember that all of these aspects of warfare,\n\n2:02:18.580 --> 2:02:22.860\n whether it's how far your cruise missiles go\n\n2:02:22.860 --> 2:02:24.820\n and how accurate they are,\n\n2:02:24.820 --> 2:02:28.180\n what size your cyber capabilities are.\n\n2:02:29.260 --> 2:02:31.900\n It's really ultimately about the people.\n\n2:02:31.900 --> 2:02:34.460\n It's about the human capital, right?\n\n2:02:34.460 --> 2:02:39.460\n It's about their willingness, their skill level,\n\n2:02:39.460 --> 2:02:41.540\n but also their willingness to fight\n\n2:02:41.540 --> 2:02:43.540\n and to put their lives on the line.\n\n2:02:43.540 --> 2:02:45.780\n And there's no substitute for that.\n\n2:02:45.780 --> 2:02:50.660\n And so what's called morale or courage or bravery or valor,\n\n2:02:51.620 --> 2:02:54.220\n that's really the ultimately decisive\n\n2:02:54.220 --> 2:02:59.220\n provided you have enough sufficient arms, right?\n\n2:02:59.540 --> 2:03:01.140\n To conduct the fight.\n\n2:03:01.140 --> 2:03:04.580\n And if you don't, you use a Molotov cocktail, right?\n\n2:03:04.580 --> 2:03:08.540\n Grandma calls in the coordinates of the Russian tank\n\n2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:13.540\n on her iPhone and you have a Molotov cocktail\n\n2:03:13.860 --> 2:03:18.740\n that the people who used to work in the cafeteria\n\n2:03:18.740 --> 2:03:22.140\n are now stuffing flammable liquid into bottles\n\n2:03:22.140 --> 2:03:23.900\n and you carry one right up to the tank\n\n2:03:23.900 --> 2:03:25.460\n and you smash it against the tank\n\n2:03:25.460 --> 2:03:29.440\n or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank, right?\n\n2:03:30.700 --> 2:03:33.100\n There's no substitute for that kind of stuff,\n\n2:03:33.100 --> 2:03:38.100\n that level of resolve, willingness to die for your country.\n\n2:03:38.100 --> 2:03:40.260\n That's a really big lesson\n\n2:03:40.260 --> 2:03:43.620\n that we need to absorb in our own country.\n\n2:03:43.620 --> 2:03:48.180\n We've been going to war more frequently than we should.\n\n2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:51.420\n And like you said, without the justification all the time,\n\n2:03:51.420 --> 2:03:53.820\n and then like Henry Kissinger said,\n\n2:03:53.820 --> 2:03:56.980\n without understanding how this was gonna end.\n\n2:03:56.980 --> 2:03:58.940\n It's easy to start a war,\n\n2:03:58.940 --> 2:04:01.900\n it's very difficult to win a war, prevail in a war\n\n2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:05.180\n or end a war on terms that meet\n\n2:04:05.180 --> 2:04:08.580\n your original expectations, right?\n\n2:04:08.580 --> 2:04:09.860\n We've been fighting wars,\n\n2:04:09.860 --> 2:04:13.620\n but we haven't been fighting wars as societies.\n\n2:04:13.620 --> 2:04:18.340\n We've been fighting wars as a small sliver of our population.\n\n2:04:18.340 --> 2:04:20.900\n Something like 1% of our population\n\n2:04:20.900 --> 2:04:22.340\n is involved with the military\n\n2:04:22.340 --> 2:04:24.780\n because we have an all volunteer force.\n\n2:04:25.700 --> 2:04:28.900\n And that means that it's easier for our politicians\n\n2:04:28.900 --> 2:04:33.900\n to go to war because they don't face conscription,\n\n2:04:33.900 --> 2:04:36.460\n they don't have the draft,\n\n2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:39.580\n which affects every family in the country.\n\n2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:44.580\n And because the number of people in the volunteer force\n\n2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:49.500\n is such a narrow stratum of the population.\n\n2:04:49.500 --> 2:04:51.940\n And so they've been getting away with this\n\n2:04:51.940 --> 2:04:53.660\n because the professional army\n\n2:04:53.660 --> 2:04:56.100\n is much better than the conscript army.\n\n2:04:56.100 --> 2:04:58.940\n And an all volunteer force is much preferable\n\n2:04:58.940 --> 2:05:01.220\n from a military point of view.\n\n2:05:01.220 --> 2:05:05.540\n But from a societal point of view, it enables you\n\n2:05:05.540 --> 2:05:09.300\n to go to war too easily as a politician.\n\n2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:12.340\n And it doesn't engage the society the same way\n\n2:05:12.340 --> 2:05:16.380\n that the Ukrainian society is completely engaged\n\n2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:18.940\n from those young hackers all the way up\n\n2:05:18.940 --> 2:05:20.780\n to those grandmothers.\n\n2:05:20.780 --> 2:05:23.340\n Let me ask you, you're a scholar of history,\n\n2:05:23.340 --> 2:05:28.340\n a scholar of geopolitics, and you're also a human being.\n\n2:05:28.340 --> 2:05:30.140\n You're also a human being.\n\n2:05:30.140 --> 2:05:31.780\n That's kind of you, Lex.\n\n2:05:31.780 --> 2:05:32.620\n I'll take that.\n\n2:05:33.820 --> 2:05:36.620\n What's the value, what's the hope,\n\n2:05:36.620 --> 2:05:39.660\n what's the power of conversation here?\n\n2:05:39.660 --> 2:05:41.860\n If you could sit down with Vladimir Putin\n\n2:05:41.860 --> 2:05:46.860\n and have a conversation versus bullets,\n\n2:05:47.060 --> 2:05:51.140\n human exchange words, is there hope for those?\n\n2:05:51.140 --> 2:05:53.100\n And if so, what would you talk about?\n\n2:05:53.100 --> 2:05:54.300\n What would you ask him?\n\n2:05:55.660 --> 2:05:57.460\n Well, Henry Kissinger,\n\n2:05:57.460 --> 2:05:58.820\n you alluded to his op ed,\n\n2:05:58.820 --> 2:06:01.620\n he's had many private meetings with President Putin\n\n2:06:03.260 --> 2:06:06.140\n over a long time.\n\n2:06:06.140 --> 2:06:10.140\n And President Biden,\n\n2:06:11.140 --> 2:06:14.980\n the previous presidents, secretaries of state,\n\n2:06:16.300 --> 2:06:18.980\n officials below secretary of state,\n\n2:06:18.980 --> 2:06:20.860\n the head of the CIA,\n\n2:06:20.860 --> 2:06:24.580\n evidently met with President Putin in the fall\n\n2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:27.900\n when he was massing the troops on the border\n\n2:06:27.900 --> 2:06:29.220\n before he invaded.\n\n2:06:30.100 --> 2:06:34.020\n And we sent the head of the CIA and Putin received him,\n\n2:06:34.860 --> 2:06:36.980\n somebody he evidently respects\n\n2:06:36.980 --> 2:06:39.220\n or was at least willing to meet,\n\n2:06:39.220 --> 2:06:41.380\n unlike other members of the administration.\n\n2:06:42.620 --> 2:06:45.060\n So a lot of people are talking to him\n\n2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:48.700\n in some form or another for the 22 years\n\n2:06:48.700 --> 2:06:49.820\n he's been in power.\n\n2:06:49.820 --> 2:06:53.900\n And I'm not sure it's had\n\n2:06:53.900 --> 2:06:57.420\n what I would call their desired effect.\n\n2:06:57.420 --> 2:07:00.020\n Well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too.\n\n2:07:00.020 --> 2:07:03.660\n And also the timing, which is post February 22nd,\n\n2:07:03.660 --> 2:07:05.340\n is a different time.\n\n2:07:05.340 --> 2:07:07.460\n And also another aspect,\n\n2:07:09.740 --> 2:07:12.660\n which Oliver Stone mentioned interestingly,\n\n2:07:12.660 --> 2:07:15.940\n that there's something about COVID and the pandemic\n\n2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:18.540\n that creates isolation, the distancing.\n\n2:07:18.540 --> 2:07:21.660\n It's such a silly little nuance thing,\n\n2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:25.740\n but maybe it's actually has a profound impact\n\n2:07:25.740 --> 2:07:29.180\n on the human being, the human mind of Vladimir Putin,\n\n2:07:29.180 --> 2:07:32.140\n that there is something about an in person meeting\n\n2:07:32.140 --> 2:07:35.540\n and not across a table that's far too large,\n\n2:07:35.540 --> 2:07:38.860\n but sort of the intimacy of one human to human\n\n2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:40.460\n in person conversation,\n\n2:07:40.460 --> 2:07:43.820\n that there's something distinctly powerful\n\n2:07:43.820 --> 2:07:48.100\n about that reminder that as Putin says\n\n2:07:48.100 --> 2:07:50.020\n in the narrative and the propaganda\n\n2:07:50.020 --> 2:07:53.980\n that we're all one people, there is truth to that,\n\n2:07:53.980 --> 2:07:57.220\n that this entirety of humanity is one people.\n\n2:07:57.220 --> 2:07:59.580\n And you're kind of reminded by that\n\n2:07:59.580 --> 2:08:01.100\n when you're sitting together.\n\n2:08:02.140 --> 2:08:06.420\n People who have sat across the table from him,\n\n2:08:06.420 --> 2:08:10.340\n whether at 30 yards or at three,\n\n2:08:11.820 --> 2:08:15.660\n have remarked upon this feeling of isolation\n\n2:08:15.660 --> 2:08:18.860\n that has affected him, the pandemic.\n\n2:08:18.860 --> 2:08:21.140\n I think there must be something to that\n\n2:08:21.140 --> 2:08:25.020\n if several people who've been in the room with him\n\n2:08:25.020 --> 2:08:26.180\n are remarking on it.\n\n2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:31.140\n Everybody that I know and I've been able to talk to\n\n2:08:31.140 --> 2:08:34.140\n who's had a meeting with him in the past 10 years,\n\n2:08:35.660 --> 2:08:39.460\n including Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State,\n\n2:08:39.460 --> 2:08:44.460\n has said that Putin spends a lot of time\n\n2:08:45.900 --> 2:08:47.900\n enumerating his grievances.\n\n2:08:49.060 --> 2:08:52.900\n He goes through a monologue of his grievances\n\n2:08:52.900 --> 2:08:54.580\n and then the West did this,\n\n2:08:54.580 --> 2:08:57.420\n and then the West lied to us about that,\n\n2:08:57.420 --> 2:09:00.860\n and then the West cheated us on this.\n\n2:09:00.860 --> 2:09:03.580\n And so it's not the conversation\n\n2:09:03.580 --> 2:09:06.780\n that you're encouraging of common humanity.\n\n2:09:06.780 --> 2:09:10.740\n It's that roiling resentment volcano\n\n2:09:10.740 --> 2:09:13.020\n that's just exploding and exploding.\n\n2:09:13.020 --> 2:09:14.300\n The resentment.\n\n2:09:14.300 --> 2:09:19.300\n And by the time he gets through the monologue\n\n2:09:19.300 --> 2:09:22.460\n of the grievances, the time of the meeting\n\n2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:25.300\n is expired or over time.\n\n2:09:25.300 --> 2:09:26.740\n That's a brilliant statement,\n\n2:09:26.740 --> 2:09:29.460\n but that's where the skill of conversation comes in.\n\n2:09:29.460 --> 2:09:32.780\n Like when you're facing a bull with a red cloth,\n\n2:09:32.780 --> 2:09:35.380\n you have to learn how to avoid the long list of grievances\n\n2:09:35.380 --> 2:09:37.260\n and get to the humanity.\n\n2:09:37.260 --> 2:09:39.540\n That's a really important skill.\n\n2:09:39.540 --> 2:09:40.820\n For sure it's a skill,\n\n2:09:40.820 --> 2:09:44.020\n and it's the highest level skill of a diplomat\n\n2:09:44.020 --> 2:09:47.660\n to be able to reach some type of common understanding\n\n2:09:47.660 --> 2:09:51.500\n when interests and worldviews clash so much.\n\n2:09:51.500 --> 2:09:53.500\n But here's your challenge, Lex.\n\n2:09:54.740 --> 2:09:59.740\n Your challenge is Russia wants to impose\n\n2:09:59.740 --> 2:10:04.740\n a closed sphere of influence on its neighbors.\n\n2:10:05.420 --> 2:10:10.420\n It wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can't do.\n\n2:10:10.420 --> 2:10:12.820\n It wants to exert influence,\n\n2:10:12.820 --> 2:10:15.100\n not by the power of its example,\n\n2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:18.300\n not by the freedom of its people,\n\n2:10:18.300 --> 2:10:22.340\n not by the dynamism of its diversified economy,\n\n2:10:22.340 --> 2:10:24.660\n but it wants to exert influence\n\n2:10:24.660 --> 2:10:27.260\n just because it deserves that,\n\n2:10:27.260 --> 2:10:30.140\n just because it's a great power,\n\n2:10:30.140 --> 2:10:33.260\n just because, and on and on and on.\n\n2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:36.060\n It's a civilization unto itself.\n\n2:10:36.060 --> 2:10:38.980\n And it wants that, and we can't give that.\n\n2:10:40.580 --> 2:10:44.580\n The reason that Russia was not integrated into the West\n\n2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:46.020\n was not for lack of trying.\n\n2:10:47.260 --> 2:10:51.820\n It was because Russia ultimately spurned the integration\n\n2:10:51.820 --> 2:10:54.140\n because it was about what terms\n\n2:10:54.140 --> 2:10:56.460\n the integration would come on.\n\n2:10:56.460 --> 2:11:00.060\n Would you come into the West and observe Western rules\n\n2:11:01.020 --> 2:11:06.020\n and be another country, meaning just another country?\n\n2:11:06.300 --> 2:11:10.580\n There's Poland, and there's Austria,\n\n2:11:10.580 --> 2:11:15.580\n and there's little tiny Monaco, and there's Russia.\n\n2:11:16.620 --> 2:11:19.460\n And you're just one of those countries.\n\n2:11:19.460 --> 2:11:21.900\n And Russia's answer to that was no,\n\n2:11:21.900 --> 2:11:24.380\n we're not just one of those countries.\n\n2:11:24.380 --> 2:11:26.620\n We need special rules.\n\n2:11:26.620 --> 2:11:29.340\n We need special conditions.\n\n2:11:29.340 --> 2:11:33.380\n We'll integrate, but only as a special country,\n\n2:11:33.380 --> 2:11:38.380\n meaning like at the UN, where all countries are sovereign,\n\n2:11:38.540 --> 2:11:40.340\n all countries are members,\n\n2:11:40.340 --> 2:11:44.780\n but Russia has a veto on what countries can and can't do.\n\n2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:48.820\n Those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate.\n\n2:11:48.820 --> 2:11:52.220\n And those were the terms that no leader of a Western country\n\n2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:56.740\n or the United States or the G7 or fill in the blank\n\n2:11:56.740 --> 2:11:58.060\n can grant to Russia.\n\n2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:03.780\n It's very well known that Vladimir Putin\n\n2:12:03.780 --> 2:12:06.460\n was one of the first, maybe the first person,\n\n2:12:06.460 --> 2:12:10.380\n first leader, foreign leader to call President Bush\n\n2:12:10.380 --> 2:12:13.380\n after the 9 11 tragedy.\n\n2:12:13.380 --> 2:12:15.420\n They didn't connect right away.\n\n2:12:15.420 --> 2:12:17.820\n President Bush was not in Washington,\n\n2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:20.260\n but eventually they did speak.\n\n2:12:20.260 --> 2:12:22.020\n He condemned the terrorist attack.\n\n2:12:22.020 --> 2:12:26.420\n He offered Russian support, which he delivered on\n\n2:12:26.420 --> 2:12:28.580\n the use of some Russian logistics\n\n2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:32.220\n for our Afghanistan operations.\n\n2:12:33.300 --> 2:12:35.420\n And a lot of people point to that and they say,\n\n2:12:35.420 --> 2:12:36.500\n there it is.\n\n2:12:36.500 --> 2:12:41.500\n Russia wanted to cooperate and did cooperate\n\n2:12:41.500 --> 2:12:45.780\n and we spurned them or we failed to appreciate\n\n2:12:45.780 --> 2:12:47.580\n Russia's cooperation.\n\n2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:51.380\n And so therefore Russia was cheated or Russia was lied to\n\n2:12:51.380 --> 2:12:53.540\n or Russia's grievances are legitimate.\n\n2:12:54.500 --> 2:12:56.980\n But here's the problem with that argument, Lex.\n\n2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:03.020\n In exchange for that support, Vladimir Putin asked\n\n2:13:03.100 --> 2:13:07.260\n in return from President Bush for a free hand\n\n2:13:07.260 --> 2:13:09.260\n in the former Soviet space,\n\n2:13:09.260 --> 2:13:13.260\n that closed hierarchical sphere of influence\n\n2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:17.420\n where Russia would exert influence coercively\n\n2:13:17.420 --> 2:13:19.180\n over countries that were sovereign.\n\n2:13:19.180 --> 2:13:23.460\n And no American president could grant that.\n\n2:13:23.460 --> 2:13:24.940\n And President Bush was right.\n\n2:13:24.940 --> 2:13:25.900\n He said no.\n\n2:13:26.820 --> 2:13:30.820\n And so the attempted cooperation blew up.\n\n2:13:31.860 --> 2:13:33.260\n But who's at fault there?\n\n2:13:35.700 --> 2:13:40.660\n Should there be a nonvoluntary sphere of influence?\n\n2:13:40.660 --> 2:13:45.340\n Should that be granted or should you face up\n\n2:13:45.340 --> 2:13:47.460\n to attempts to do that?\n\n2:13:47.460 --> 2:13:51.020\n You know, let's take a little detour here\n\n2:13:51.020 --> 2:13:52.460\n into China for a second.\n\n2:13:54.340 --> 2:13:56.660\n China had this brilliant grand strategy,\n\n2:13:57.900 --> 2:14:01.780\n which was sure, America is hostile\n\n2:14:01.780 --> 2:14:03.580\n because America is hegemonic.\n\n2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:05.780\n America wants to control the world.\n\n2:14:05.780 --> 2:14:07.860\n America will never let China rise.\n\n2:14:07.860 --> 2:14:11.420\n America will do everything it can to hold China down.\n\n2:14:11.420 --> 2:14:14.940\n So we're gonna have hostility from America.\n\n2:14:14.940 --> 2:14:17.780\n We don't wanna decouple because we need\n\n2:14:17.780 --> 2:14:20.500\n that high end technology transfer.\n\n2:14:20.500 --> 2:14:22.300\n Either we buy it or we steal it\n\n2:14:22.300 --> 2:14:24.140\n because America and the rest of the West\n\n2:14:24.140 --> 2:14:26.660\n has all the technology that we need.\n\n2:14:26.660 --> 2:14:29.140\n We have some of it domestically,\n\n2:14:29.140 --> 2:14:31.140\n more than before by a lot,\n\n2:14:31.140 --> 2:14:33.980\n but we're still dependent so we can't decouple.\n\n2:14:33.980 --> 2:14:35.660\n So we'll have the hostility,\n\n2:14:35.660 --> 2:14:37.460\n but there'll be a line we don't cross\n\n2:14:37.460 --> 2:14:40.180\n just so that we don't lose the technology transfer.\n\n2:14:40.180 --> 2:14:45.180\n Till Made in China 2035 is accomplished\n\n2:14:45.620 --> 2:14:48.380\n and we're self sufficient domestically\n\n2:14:48.380 --> 2:14:50.940\n in AI and every other area that's critical.\n\n2:14:52.340 --> 2:14:53.900\n But hostility from America.\n\n2:14:53.900 --> 2:14:55.860\n But we have an ace in the hole.\n\n2:14:55.860 --> 2:14:58.060\n Our ace in the hole is Europe.\n\n2:14:58.060 --> 2:15:00.100\n Europe hates conflict.\n\n2:15:00.100 --> 2:15:01.540\n They're all about trade.\n\n2:15:02.420 --> 2:15:04.700\n Doesn't matter how evil you are.\n\n2:15:04.700 --> 2:15:09.100\n They love to trade because Wandel durch Handel,\n\n2:15:09.100 --> 2:15:10.580\n change through trade.\n\n2:15:10.580 --> 2:15:11.660\n They have this illusion\n\n2:15:11.660 --> 2:15:14.300\n that you're gonna become a better country\n\n2:15:14.300 --> 2:15:15.500\n if they trade with you\n\n2:15:15.500 --> 2:15:18.020\n and you won't have conflict, war and hostilities\n\n2:15:18.020 --> 2:15:19.460\n if you trade.\n\n2:15:19.460 --> 2:15:22.460\n And so we have this European ace in the hole.\n\n2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:24.260\n We're hostile with the Americans.\n\n2:15:24.260 --> 2:15:27.820\n We're still buying or stealing their technology.\n\n2:15:27.820 --> 2:15:29.620\n And better than that even,\n\n2:15:29.620 --> 2:15:32.660\n the Europeans are not hostile to us at all.\n\n2:15:32.660 --> 2:15:33.780\n They love to trade with us\n\n2:15:33.780 --> 2:15:35.100\n and they wanna trade more\n\n2:15:35.100 --> 2:15:38.180\n and they're our biggest trading partner already.\n\n2:15:38.180 --> 2:15:39.180\n And lo and behold,\n\n2:15:39.180 --> 2:15:41.740\n Xi Jinping sides with Vladimir Putin\n\n2:15:42.620 --> 2:15:45.100\n in the aggression in Ukraine.\n\n2:15:45.100 --> 2:15:49.300\n He doesn't side with him providing military equipment.\n\n2:15:49.300 --> 2:15:51.860\n He doesn't provide technology transfer\n\n2:15:52.940 --> 2:15:55.620\n but he provides public support\n\n2:15:55.620 --> 2:15:58.060\n and massive pro Russian propaganda\n\n2:15:58.060 --> 2:15:59.940\n to the whole Chinese population.\n\n2:16:01.900 --> 2:16:04.300\n And the Europeans say, wait a minute,\n\n2:16:04.300 --> 2:16:07.620\n this is an invasion of a sovereign country in Europe.\n\n2:16:07.620 --> 2:16:08.620\n What do you mean?\n\n2:16:09.580 --> 2:16:12.940\n You're not condemning Vladimir Putin's invasion.\n\n2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:15.700\n And so that wedge that the Chinese had,\n\n2:16:15.700 --> 2:16:18.340\n that was the basis of their grand strategy,\n\n2:16:18.340 --> 2:16:21.060\n that wedge between the US and Europe\n\n2:16:21.060 --> 2:16:23.060\n when it came to China policy,\n\n2:16:23.060 --> 2:16:24.820\n that wedge is gone now.\n\n2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:27.100\n Xi Jinping destroyed it.\n\n2:16:27.100 --> 2:16:29.180\n And the Europeans and the Americans\n\n2:16:29.180 --> 2:16:31.340\n are coming close together\n\n2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:34.700\n on Ukraine and Russia policy for sure,\n\n2:16:34.700 --> 2:16:38.420\n but also more and more on China policy.\n\n2:16:38.420 --> 2:16:40.740\n And so that was a pretty big sacrifice\n\n2:16:40.740 --> 2:16:42.740\n for the Chinese leader to make.\n\n2:16:42.740 --> 2:16:44.260\n And what did he get in return?\n\n2:16:45.420 --> 2:16:49.980\n He gets hydrocarbons from Russia at reduced prices.\n\n2:16:49.980 --> 2:16:53.620\n And the Chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries.\n\n2:16:54.540 --> 2:16:58.660\n They have a completely diverse supply chain\n\n2:16:58.660 --> 2:16:59.620\n for their energy.\n\n2:16:59.620 --> 2:17:02.140\n So what do you think Xi Jinping is thinking now?\n\n2:17:02.140 --> 2:17:04.500\n Was it a mistake or?\n\n2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:06.140\n I'd like to know, Lex.\n\n2:17:06.140 --> 2:17:08.580\n I'd like you to be able to sit down with him\n\n2:17:08.580 --> 2:17:11.460\n across from this table here on your podcast\n\n2:17:11.460 --> 2:17:13.380\n and pose that same question to him\n\n2:17:13.380 --> 2:17:14.780\n because we have no idea.\n\n2:17:14.780 --> 2:17:16.740\n There's a language barrier that's fascinating.\n\n2:17:16.740 --> 2:17:20.140\n By the way, you as a scholar of Stalin,\n\n2:17:20.140 --> 2:17:21.580\n do you think we'll ever break through\n\n2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:24.100\n the language barrier to China?\n\n2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:27.180\n Not ever, I apologize, in the next few years\n\n2:17:27.180 --> 2:17:30.860\n because there is a gigantic cultural and language barrier\n\n2:17:30.860 --> 2:17:32.380\n between the West and the Chinese.\n\n2:17:32.380 --> 2:17:34.300\n China's a great civilization.\n\n2:17:34.300 --> 2:17:39.300\n China predates the United States by millennia.\n\n2:17:39.740 --> 2:17:42.540\n China's accomplishments are breathtaking.\n\n2:17:42.540 --> 2:17:46.220\n But China's also led by, let's be honest,\n\n2:17:46.220 --> 2:17:48.460\n a Communist Party monopoly\n\n2:17:49.740 --> 2:17:52.940\n which engages in a lot of criminal behavior.\n\n2:17:52.940 --> 2:17:56.180\n Lex, Tibet is Ukraine.\n\n2:17:57.260 --> 2:17:59.740\n Xinjiang is Ukraine.\n\n2:17:59.740 --> 2:18:03.300\n Hong Kong is Ukraine,\n\n2:18:04.980 --> 2:18:07.260\n let alone support for Putin, Ukraine.\n\n2:18:07.260 --> 2:18:09.540\n This is before we've even discussed Taiwan.\n\n2:18:10.420 --> 2:18:13.220\n And so now the Europeans are coming to see this\n\n2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:16.340\n and the Americans are coming to understand this,\n\n2:18:16.340 --> 2:18:20.100\n that maybe trading with a regime like that,\n\n2:18:22.060 --> 2:18:25.500\n morally, politically, criminally,\n\n2:18:25.500 --> 2:18:28.660\n Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong,\n\n2:18:28.660 --> 2:18:31.900\n how is that different from what Putin is doing in Ukraine?\n\n2:18:31.900 --> 2:18:35.700\n I'd be hard pressed to differentiate that ultimately,\n\n2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:38.660\n even though the analogies are not exact.\n\n2:18:38.660 --> 2:18:43.660\n And so the Chinese, it's like that guy Leonov,\n\n2:18:43.860 --> 2:18:46.140\n the author of Licheletia,\n\n2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:50.860\n the great memoir of the late Soviet period,\n\n2:18:50.860 --> 2:18:52.700\n the end of the Soviet Union.\n\n2:18:52.700 --> 2:18:55.140\n You know that they spend all this time\n\n2:18:55.140 --> 2:18:58.180\n and all these resources blackening our image,\n\n2:18:58.180 --> 2:19:00.500\n but we supply them with endless material\n\n2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:02.340\n to blacken our image.\n\n2:19:02.340 --> 2:19:05.700\n That's where Xi Jinping's regime is right now, Lex.\n\n2:19:05.700 --> 2:19:09.580\n And so they have a big dilemma on their side.\n\n2:19:09.580 --> 2:19:11.700\n It's a Western world\n\n2:19:11.700 --> 2:19:14.300\n and they've united the Western world\n\n2:19:14.300 --> 2:19:19.300\n and reawoken the Western world\n\n2:19:19.340 --> 2:19:23.620\n to the fact that China is a threat\n\n2:19:23.620 --> 2:19:27.660\n to the values, the institutions and values of the West.\n\n2:19:27.660 --> 2:19:31.100\n And that trade is not transforming China quite the opposite.\n\n2:19:32.020 --> 2:19:34.100\n We'll see if this endures.\n\n2:19:34.100 --> 2:19:35.420\n Maybe it doesn't endure.\n\n2:19:35.420 --> 2:19:36.940\n Maybe it's a fleeting moment.\n\n2:19:36.940 --> 2:19:39.580\n Maybe this is not an inflection point.\n\n2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:43.820\n Maybe the war in Ukraine ends more quickly than we think.\n\n2:19:43.820 --> 2:19:45.660\n And maybe like you said,\n\n2:19:45.660 --> 2:19:48.220\n the Chinese and the Indians and the rest of them,\n\n2:19:48.220 --> 2:19:50.780\n the leaders there, they get their wish that it ends\n\n2:19:50.780 --> 2:19:54.460\n and the world moves on and forgets\n\n2:19:54.460 --> 2:19:59.460\n or says, let's try again to resume\n\n2:19:59.940 --> 2:20:01.740\n our mutual understanding,\n\n2:20:01.740 --> 2:20:04.860\n our mutually beneficial trade and everything else.\n\n2:20:04.860 --> 2:20:06.420\n Maybe it's a passing phase.\n\n2:20:06.420 --> 2:20:07.420\n We can't exclude that.\n\n2:20:07.420 --> 2:20:09.700\n I'm very poor at predicting the future.\n\n2:20:10.540 --> 2:20:14.820\n But the moment is not a good one for the Chinese regime,\n\n2:20:14.820 --> 2:20:18.540\n let alone the fact that he's trying to impose\n\n2:20:19.740 --> 2:20:23.740\n an unprecedented in the modern era third term\n\n2:20:23.740 --> 2:20:26.140\n for himself as president in the fall\n\n2:20:26.140 --> 2:20:28.420\n at the next party Congress,\n\n2:20:28.420 --> 2:20:33.420\n becoming president for life de facto, a Mao like figure.\n\n2:20:35.420 --> 2:20:40.420\n And he's now got to do that within this environment\n\n2:20:41.020 --> 2:20:45.140\n where he has damaged Chinese grand strategy\n\n2:20:45.140 --> 2:20:47.700\n and damaged the reputation of China\n\n2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:51.020\n and its relationships across the world.\n\n2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:53.780\n Maybe not permanently, but significantly,\n\n2:20:54.700 --> 2:20:57.140\n in addition to the problems they have at home,\n\n2:20:57.140 --> 2:21:02.140\n demography, as you know, a middle income trap,\n\n2:21:02.260 --> 2:21:07.260\n and then the regulatory insanity of Chinese communist rule\n\n2:21:07.780 --> 2:21:10.740\n that we've seen with the tech companies that you know well,\n\n2:21:10.740 --> 2:21:12.860\n where they've destroyed all of that value\n\n2:21:14.100 --> 2:21:17.140\n with the blow up of their property sector\n\n2:21:17.140 --> 2:21:19.660\n because it was a massive bubble\n\n2:21:19.660 --> 2:21:21.940\n and that's still playing out.\n\n2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:24.180\n And this time it's the same,\n\n2:21:24.180 --> 2:21:27.060\n meaning this time it's not different.\n\n2:21:27.060 --> 2:21:29.060\n When it comes to a property blowout,\n\n2:21:29.060 --> 2:21:33.220\n it has enormous effects on middle class balance sheets\n\n2:21:33.220 --> 2:21:37.580\n and their ability to remain consumers\n\n2:21:37.580 --> 2:21:38.820\n and drive the economy,\n\n2:21:38.820 --> 2:21:40.940\n which is the model that they have to share.\n\n2:21:40.940 --> 2:21:45.940\n So he's got a litany of challenges independent even\n\n2:21:45.940 --> 2:21:50.940\n of the fact that he sided with his pal Vladimir Putin\n\n2:21:51.580 --> 2:21:54.220\n and their bromance is costing China\n\n2:21:54.220 --> 2:21:55.940\n very, very significantly.\n\n2:21:55.940 --> 2:21:58.660\n If you close your eyes.\n\n2:21:58.660 --> 2:21:59.940\n Yes.\n\n2:21:59.940 --> 2:22:03.540\n And a hundred years ago in 1922\n\n2:22:03.540 --> 2:22:05.860\n and you think about the future,\n\n2:22:05.860 --> 2:22:08.300\n I wonder if you can hear the drums of war\n\n2:22:09.980 --> 2:22:11.780\n predicting the 30s,\n\n2:22:11.780 --> 2:22:16.700\n predicting the great depression and the resentment\n\n2:22:16.700 --> 2:22:20.180\n that builds the economic resentment,\n\n2:22:20.180 --> 2:22:22.700\n the cultural resentment, the geopolitical resentment\n\n2:22:22.700 --> 2:22:24.900\n that builds and leads to World War II.\n\n2:22:26.540 --> 2:22:28.780\n At least to me, when I close my eyes,\n\n2:22:28.780 --> 2:22:33.220\n I can hear the drums of war that are still ahead of us.\n\n2:22:33.220 --> 2:22:36.220\n And it's possible that 2022 will materialize\n\n2:22:36.220 --> 2:22:41.220\n in a similar way as did 1922.\n\n2:22:45.180 --> 2:22:46.980\n I have my eyes closed, Lex.\n\n2:22:46.980 --> 2:22:48.060\n Do you hear anything?\n\n2:22:48.060 --> 2:22:51.860\n And I sure hope that that's not what happens.\n\n2:22:51.860 --> 2:22:56.740\n But I'm looking in 1922, it's an epoch I know well\n\n2:22:56.740 --> 2:23:00.180\n and I don't see the future that unfolds.\n\n2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:02.980\n I would not have predicted it had I been alive then.\n\n2:23:02.980 --> 2:23:06.640\n I see the war behind us.\n\n2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:10.040\n I see a prosperity on the horizon.\n\n2:23:10.040 --> 2:23:11.960\n Yes, inflation in Germany\n\n2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:15.840\n and some many other difficult issues,\n\n2:23:15.840 --> 2:23:18.400\n but there are more democracies now\n\n2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:19.800\n than there were before the war\n\n2:23:19.800 --> 2:23:22.200\n and the old empires are gone.\n\n2:23:22.200 --> 2:23:24.400\n And there's a cultural efflorescence\n\n2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:26.480\n and there's modernism in the arts\n\n2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:29.480\n and there's women entering the public sphere\n\n2:23:29.480 --> 2:23:31.680\n and there's all this fantastic new technology\n\n2:23:31.680 --> 2:23:33.800\n like automobiles.\n\n2:23:33.800 --> 2:23:38.360\n And I'm looking at the future from 1922\n\n2:23:38.360 --> 2:23:40.680\n and I'm not seeing the Great Depression\n\n2:23:40.680 --> 2:23:42.280\n and I'm not seeing World War II\n\n2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:44.600\n and I'm not seeing the Holocaust\n\n2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:48.000\n because I don't predict the future\n\n2:23:48.000 --> 2:23:51.140\n and nobody in 1922 could see that future,\n\n2:23:51.140 --> 2:23:54.200\n although I guess there were some clairvoyants\n\n2:23:54.200 --> 2:23:56.260\n who predicted it, but.\n\n2:23:56.260 --> 2:23:57.640\n But you're not one of them.\n\n2:23:57.640 --> 2:23:59.560\n I'm not one of them.\n\n2:23:59.560 --> 2:24:03.360\n But this is what I know, Lex, from studying history.\n\n2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:05.480\n What I know is stuff happens.\n\n2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:10.480\n In other words, in other words, Lex,\n\n2:24:10.820 --> 2:24:13.660\n we're watching Ukraine war right now\n\n2:24:13.660 --> 2:24:16.060\n and all of our attention is focused on that.\n\n2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:19.560\n And it's like the economists say in their textbooks\n\n2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:24.040\n when their powerful models are employed\n\n2:24:24.040 --> 2:24:26.120\n and there's this line that says\n\n2:24:26.120 --> 2:24:30.280\n all other factors held constant, comma,\n\n2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:33.400\n and then the model works.\n\n2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:35.160\n And you get this really great result.\n\n2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:39.640\n It's very powerful predictor and analysis, the model.\n\n2:24:40.780 --> 2:24:44.300\n And the whole game is all other factors held constant.\n\n2:24:45.420 --> 2:24:48.240\n So the Russia, Ukraine war that we've been discussing\n\n2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:50.640\n and this could happen and that could happen,\n\n2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:53.080\n but you know what stuff could happen, Lex.\n\n2:24:53.080 --> 2:24:56.200\n For example, the Israeli government\n\n2:24:56.200 --> 2:25:00.240\n could decide this summer that it's gonna bomb Iran\n\n2:25:00.240 --> 2:25:03.480\n because no Israeli government will tolerate Iran\n\n2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.840\n acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:08.720\n And since President Trump exited,\n\n2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:13.720\n unilaterally exited from the multipower nuclear agreement,\n\n2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:17.120\n Iran is now much closer to the bomb than they were\n\n2:25:18.300 --> 2:25:19.140\n when they were still in,\n\n2:25:19.140 --> 2:25:22.080\n when the United States was still in that agreement.\n\n2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:24.260\n And you tell me the Israeli government that says,\n\n2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:26.900\n sure, it's fine, it's okay, Iran can get the bomb.\n\n2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:29.800\n And so maybe that happens.\n\n2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:31.840\n And maybe that happens as early as this summer\n\n2:25:31.840 --> 2:25:35.760\n as Iran gets closer and closer and closer to the bomb.\n\n2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:40.760\n Maybe that guy in North Korea decides it's his time\n\n2:25:40.760 --> 2:25:45.640\n just like his grandfather, right, in 1950 decided,\n\n2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:48.280\n you know, it's time, we're gonna quote reunify,\n\n2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:53.280\n unquote, the Korean peninsula, maybe, I don't know, Lex,\n\n2:25:54.760 --> 2:25:57.400\n fill in the blank, something's gonna happen.\n\n2:25:57.400 --> 2:25:59.240\n It's not gonna be what I predict.\n\n2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:01.880\n It's not gonna be what I'm watching.\n\n2:26:01.880 --> 2:26:05.600\n It's gonna be obvious only after it happens, not before.\n\n2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:08.720\n And then it's gonna upend the table.\n\n2:26:10.120 --> 2:26:12.080\n And all of a sudden.\n\n2:26:12.080 --> 2:26:12.920\n Everything changes.\n\n2:26:12.920 --> 2:26:14.680\n We're gonna be in a different environment,\n\n2:26:14.680 --> 2:26:18.520\n different circumstances, and is Ukraine still\n\n2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:23.200\n as central at that point as it seems to be right now?\n\n2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:24.880\n I don't know the answer to that question.\n\n2:26:24.880 --> 2:26:28.060\n Let me ask two rapid fire questions.\n\n2:26:28.060 --> 2:26:29.600\n You're only allowed to have one minute\n\n2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:32.160\n and it's about predicting the future.\n\n2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:36.400\n Okay, question one, Vladimir Putin,\n\n2:26:36.400 --> 2:26:39.760\n when will he no longer be in office?\n\n2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:44.760\n And will he step down or be overthrown?\n\n2:26:44.840 --> 2:26:48.320\n What's your prediction and a brief explanation\n\n2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:49.400\n of that prediction?\n\n2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:52.000\n Now, nobody can predict the future,\n\n2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:53.560\n but what's your sense now?\n\n2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:56.880\n Some people are saying the pressure is building.\n\n2:26:56.880 --> 2:26:59.560\n He's going to be overthrown or step down\n\n2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.080\n at the end of this year.\n\n2:27:01.080 --> 2:27:06.080\n And some people say surely he's going to last,\n\n2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:09.200\n outlast Stalin's rule of 30 plus years.\n\n2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:14.200\n No evidence of a coup yet, none whatsoever, yet.\n\n2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:22.380\n He's pretty much at life expectancy for a Russian male.\n\n2:27:23.940 --> 2:27:25.560\n Those are bad numbers.\n\n2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:29.260\n He's 69, gonna be 70.\n\n2:27:29.260 --> 2:27:32.620\n So he's lived the life of a Russian male already,\n\n2:27:32.620 --> 2:27:36.120\n but he's got better doctors than the majority\n\n2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:41.120\n of the Russian males in that, let's say comparison set.\n\n2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:46.320\n So he could live a very long time with good doctors.\n\n2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:49.680\n So there could be a coup at some point,\n\n2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:54.360\n but there's none today in evidence.\n\n2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.360\n He could go because he's reached the life expectancy\n\n2:27:58.360 --> 2:28:00.960\n or he could stay for a long time.\n\n2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:04.120\n The thing to watch about this\n\n2:28:04.120 --> 2:28:08.520\n is an organization that nobody pays attention to.\n\n2:28:08.520 --> 2:28:12.720\n The FSO, the Federalnaya Sluzhba Akhrani,\n\n2:28:12.720 --> 2:28:15.080\n which is the Praetorian Guard,\n\n2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:18.640\n the self standing bodyguard directorate,\n\n2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:21.860\n the only one, the only organization in Russia\n\n2:28:21.860 --> 2:28:24.240\n that has any access to him.\n\n2:28:24.240 --> 2:28:28.640\n We've seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks,\n\n2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:33.520\n no defections, nothing in the public realm and open sources\n\n2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:37.840\n about any divisions or problems in the FSO,\n\n2:28:37.840 --> 2:28:39.840\n in the Praetorian Guard.\n\n2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:44.840\n So if you can't break that, change that illicit defections\n\n2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:50.120\n there, you can't overturn him.\n\n2:28:50.120 --> 2:28:52.840\n Authoritarian regimes, Lex, they're terrible.\n\n2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:54.680\n They fail at everything.\n\n2:28:54.680 --> 2:28:57.480\n They can't feed their people.\n\n2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:00.720\n They have trouble achieving any goals.\n\n2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:04.200\n They only have to be good, however, at one thing.\n\n2:29:04.200 --> 2:29:05.320\n They only have to be good\n\n2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:08.960\n at the complete suppression of political alternatives.\n\n2:29:08.960 --> 2:29:12.400\n If you can suppress political alternatives,\n\n2:29:12.400 --> 2:29:14.520\n you can fail at everything else,\n\n2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:17.640\n but you can survive as an authoritarian regime.\n\n2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:19.520\n So you watch Navalny.\n\n2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:21.760\n He's still alive.\n\n2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:23.920\n Okay, Lex, you go for it.\n\n2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:26.760\n That's my second rapid fire question\n\n2:29:26.760 --> 2:29:28.400\n is what happens to Navalny?\n\n2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:31.440\n What are the possible conclusions of what you said\n\n2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:33.840\n quite possibly the second most influential,\n\n2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:36.240\n powerful figure in Russia?\n\n2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:41.000\n Is he going to die in jail?\n\n2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:44.040\n Will he become the next president of Russia?\n\n2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:45.840\n Well, what are the possible?\n\n2:29:45.840 --> 2:29:47.480\n I wish I knew, Lex.\n\n2:29:47.480 --> 2:29:50.520\n I've been surprised that he's still alive.\n\n2:29:50.520 --> 2:29:54.760\n I've been worried that he will be killed in prison\n\n2:29:54.760 --> 2:29:59.760\n in a staged fight, some security officer,\n\n2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:03.360\n prison guard puts on a prison outfit,\n\n2:30:03.360 --> 2:30:05.320\n takes a lead pipe, goes into the cell.\n\n2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:08.640\n They have a quote fight and Navalny is killed.\n\n2:30:08.640 --> 2:30:11.600\n I've been afraid of that, but he's still alive\n\n2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:14.480\n even though he's serving a long sentence.\n\n2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:19.080\n So that leads me to guess that people inside\n\n2:30:19.080 --> 2:30:22.000\n the Putin regime and maybe President Putin himself\n\n2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:27.000\n understand that Navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions.\n\n2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:33.680\n That Navalny is even more popular outside of Russia\n\n2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:35.280\n than he is inside of Russia.\n\n2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:39.360\n He's the leader in many ways of the political opposition\n\n2:30:39.360 --> 2:30:42.720\n in the country, even while still in prison,\n\n2:30:42.720 --> 2:30:45.440\n his organization's been destroyed,\n\n2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:48.680\n but he doesn't have majority support in the population\n\n2:30:48.680 --> 2:30:50.320\n by any stretch of the imagination,\n\n2:30:50.320 --> 2:30:52.720\n but he's a big figure in the West,\n\n2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:54.960\n including here in the US.\n\n2:30:54.960 --> 2:30:57.440\n And so Navalny could be their ticket.\n\n2:30:57.440 --> 2:31:00.000\n They're kind of get out of jail card,\n\n2:31:00.000 --> 2:31:02.560\n meaning they release him from prison.\n\n2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:03.960\n He gets appointed, I don't know,\n\n2:31:03.960 --> 2:31:06.520\n prime minister even by the Putin regime\n\n2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:09.440\n if he were willing to accept such a position.\n\n2:31:09.440 --> 2:31:11.600\n And I have my doubts about that.\n\n2:31:11.600 --> 2:31:14.440\n And then that's how they lobby\n\n2:31:14.440 --> 2:31:17.200\n to remove the sanctions against them.\n\n2:31:17.200 --> 2:31:20.400\n So he's a card that President Putin could play.\n\n2:31:21.640 --> 2:31:24.840\n And so maybe that's the reason he's still alive,\n\n2:31:24.840 --> 2:31:28.520\n or maybe there are other reasons that we don't know.\n\n2:31:28.520 --> 2:31:33.520\n And so some alternative to Putin is more likely to arise\n\n2:31:34.320 --> 2:31:39.320\n inside his gang, Putin's Shika, as they say, right?\n\n2:31:39.640 --> 2:31:44.640\n Inside his gang, where they tire of his mistakes,\n\n2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:48.320\n they tire of his self defeating actions.\n\n2:31:48.320 --> 2:31:51.320\n And they say, patriotically for Russia,\n\n2:31:52.200 --> 2:31:56.000\n we need to do something against, move against this guy\n\n2:31:56.000 --> 2:31:58.880\n because he's hurting our country\n\n2:31:58.880 --> 2:32:01.360\n and also because I could do better.\n\n2:32:01.360 --> 2:32:04.760\n I'm ambitious as well as patriotic.\n\n2:32:04.760 --> 2:32:06.880\n But once again, the problem there, Lex,\n\n2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:11.880\n is Putin is surrounded by this cocoon known as the FSO.\n\n2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:15.880\n He meets on Zoom, predominantly with the rest\n\n2:32:15.880 --> 2:32:17.880\n of the government, including with the defense\n\n2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:20.560\n and security officials.\n\n2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:24.400\n They don't have frequent access to his person.\n\n2:32:24.400 --> 2:32:27.880\n And as you were alluding earlier to the pandemic,\n\n2:32:27.880 --> 2:32:29.960\n they have to quarantine for two weeks\n\n2:32:29.960 --> 2:32:31.880\n before every meeting with him.\n\n2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:36.320\n And moreover, you know, Lex, they don't know where he is.\n\n2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:38.720\n You see, when they're on Zoom with him,\n\n2:32:38.720 --> 2:32:43.720\n and the room, it's the Valdai.\n\n2:32:44.240 --> 2:32:48.240\n His office in the Valdai region looks the same\n\n2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:51.720\n as his office in Sochi,\n\n2:32:51.720 --> 2:32:54.920\n or his office outside of Moscow in Novogorod.\n\n2:32:54.920 --> 2:32:57.280\n They're made up to look very similar on Zoom.\n\n2:32:58.960 --> 2:33:02.360\n And sure, some signs they're looking, where is it?\n\n2:33:02.360 --> 2:33:05.040\n But maybe they don't know.\n\n2:33:05.040 --> 2:33:06.760\n And so they're not sure.\n\n2:33:06.760 --> 2:33:10.920\n Maybe they don't know, and so you're gonna move on him,\n\n2:33:10.920 --> 2:33:13.640\n and you're gonna jump him in his Kremlin,\n\n2:33:13.640 --> 2:33:17.240\n his dacha outside Moscow.\n\n2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:20.080\n And it turns out he's in Sochi, or vice versa.\n\n2:33:20.080 --> 2:33:23.280\n And it turns out the FSO is loyal to him\n\n2:33:23.280 --> 2:33:24.920\n and won't let you anyway.\n\n2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:29.920\n So Lex, we don't know, but we watch this FSO really closely,\n\n2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:34.160\n and we think that the elites, if not Putin,\n\n2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:37.240\n but maybe Putin too, understand Navalny\n\n2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:40.400\n as a really big potential political card\n\n2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:41.960\n that they could play.\n\n2:33:41.960 --> 2:33:46.040\n And one last question, the biggest question.\n\n2:33:46.040 --> 2:33:49.320\n You studied some of the darkest aspects\n\n2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:52.200\n of human history, human nature.\n\n2:33:52.200 --> 2:33:54.600\n Let me ask the why question.\n\n2:33:54.600 --> 2:33:56.360\n What are we doing here?\n\n2:33:57.240 --> 2:33:59.840\n What's the meaning of our existence,\n\n2:33:59.840 --> 2:34:01.840\n our life here on Earth?\n\n2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:04.600\n What are we humans trying to get at here?\n\n2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:07.120\n I can't answer that question either,\n\n2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:11.320\n but I can say that having a purposeful life\n\n2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:14.320\n is actually not that hard.\n\n2:34:15.640 --> 2:34:18.840\n You can't, you're not Gandhi, right?\n\n2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:21.480\n You're not President Roosevelt.\n\n2:34:21.480 --> 2:34:25.240\n You're not gonna transform a country or a civilization\n\n2:34:25.240 --> 2:34:30.120\n or become immortal because of your courage\n\n2:34:30.120 --> 2:34:33.880\n and your insight and your genius at critical moments.\n\n2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:37.360\n But you live in an environment,\n\n2:34:37.360 --> 2:34:41.200\n you're in a school, you're in a workplace,\n\n2:34:41.200 --> 2:34:44.760\n you're somewhere where you can affect other people\n\n2:34:44.760 --> 2:34:46.680\n in a positive way.\n\n2:34:46.680 --> 2:34:48.680\n It can be not just about yourself,\n\n2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:50.160\n but it can be about them.\n\n2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:55.560\n And you can have a positive impact on other people's lives\n\n2:34:55.560 --> 2:34:57.320\n through the work that you do,\n\n2:34:57.320 --> 2:35:00.080\n whether that's your employment or your charity\n\n2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:03.200\n or your spare time or your work time.\n\n2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:07.200\n It can be by modeling proper behavior, right?\n\n2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:12.200\n Admitting your mistakes, hard to do, but necessary.\n\n2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:14.640\n Remembering that you don't know everything,\n\n2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:16.040\n you can't predict the future,\n\n2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:17.480\n but you don't even know everything\n\n2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:20.200\n in your areas of expertise.\n\n2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:23.640\n Painfully reminded of that humility at times,\n\n2:35:23.640 --> 2:35:25.960\n but remind yourself too.\n\n2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:30.960\n So you can lead a life that can show others\n\n2:35:31.760 --> 2:35:34.040\n what good values are,\n\n2:35:34.040 --> 2:35:37.520\n and you can lead a life that dedicates yourself\n\n2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:40.880\n not only to your own material wellbeing,\n\n2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:42.440\n but to the wellbeing\n\n2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:44.400\n and to the development of others around you.\n\n2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:47.280\n And it can be on a humble scale.\n\n2:35:47.280 --> 2:35:50.320\n It can be in a small classroom or a small workplace,\n\n2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:54.680\n a small work team, but it can be done.\n\n2:35:54.680 --> 2:35:58.680\n And you can be reminded that having a positive impact\n\n2:35:58.680 --> 2:36:00.920\n even on one other person\n\n2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:04.240\n gives far greater meaning to your own life.\n\n2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:06.520\n And it's profoundly satisfying,\n\n2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:10.840\n much more satisfying than the attention you might get,\n\n2:36:10.840 --> 2:36:15.280\n let's say on social media or awards you might receive.\n\n2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:17.720\n There's nothing wrong with pursuing those.\n\n2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:21.160\n People pursue them and it's a free society.\n\n2:36:21.160 --> 2:36:26.160\n But leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible.\n\n2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:30.560\n Even just one person, I love the expression,\n\n2:36:30.560 --> 2:36:33.400\n save one life, save the world.\n\n2:36:33.400 --> 2:36:36.520\n Just focusing on the local,\n\n2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:39.080\n on the tiny little difference you can make in the world\n\n2:36:39.080 --> 2:36:40.680\n can somehow ripple.\n\n2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:42.040\n Every day.\n\n2:36:42.040 --> 2:36:44.520\n If you think about that every single day,\n\n2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:47.680\n you're a better person.\n\n2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:49.520\n We're a better society.\n\n2:36:49.520 --> 2:36:52.920\n And maybe you get to add a bit of love to the world\n\n2:36:52.920 --> 2:36:53.800\n after all.\n\n2:36:55.400 --> 2:36:59.200\n Steven, this is a huge honor for many reasons,\n\n2:36:59.200 --> 2:37:01.720\n one of which is I can just tell\n\n2:37:01.720 --> 2:37:04.240\n how much care you put into this conversation\n\n2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:08.360\n and how much, I use the word love a lot,\n\n2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:12.720\n but I just feel the love that,\n\n2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:14.600\n just even the respect you give me,\n\n2:37:14.600 --> 2:37:17.760\n which I can't tell you how energizing that is,\n\n2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:19.880\n how much that gives me strength\n\n2:37:19.880 --> 2:37:22.560\n for my own silly little pursuits.\n\n2:37:23.680 --> 2:37:24.840\n Thank you so much for doing that.\n\n2:37:24.840 --> 2:37:26.360\n Thank you for not just talking today,\n\n2:37:26.360 --> 2:37:29.200\n but giving me so much respect\n\n2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:30.680\n just with everything you're doing.\n\n2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:32.160\n I really appreciate that.\n\n2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:33.800\n It makes me feel special.\n\n2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:36.000\n So thank you so much for sitting down and talking today.\n\n2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:38.520\n Mutual, Lex, thank you as well\n\n2:37:38.520 --> 2:37:41.600\n and thank you for the respect that you've shown me.\n\n2:37:41.600 --> 2:37:43.400\n These are really difficult issues\n\n2:37:43.400 --> 2:37:45.680\n that don't have simple answers.\n\n2:37:45.680 --> 2:37:48.320\n But that doesn't mean we give up.\n\n2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:52.920\n We have to keep thinking and learning and trying\n\n2:37:52.920 --> 2:37:56.040\n and finding solutions in everything we do,\n\n2:37:56.040 --> 2:37:59.360\n including on these big global tragedies\n\n2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:01.040\n that we live through.\n\n2:38:01.040 --> 2:38:04.560\n And it's heartbreaking what's going on.\n\n2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:06.600\n It just breaks my heart every day.\n\n2:38:06.600 --> 2:38:08.080\n A person who studies this,\n\n2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:10.760\n I've been studying this for decades,\n\n2:38:10.760 --> 2:38:12.080\n and it keeps happening.\n\n2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:15.440\n And you think, again, and yes, it is again,\n\n2:38:15.440 --> 2:38:18.120\n but we still have to keep trying\n\n2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:20.120\n and we have to be inspired\n\n2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:23.160\n by those people who are more courageous than we are\n\n2:38:23.160 --> 2:38:26.160\n and sacrifice more than we sacrifice.\n\n2:38:26.160 --> 2:38:29.520\n For me, the Russian invasion of Ukraine,\n\n2:38:29.520 --> 2:38:34.520\n the war in Ukraine is experienced in my study at home\n\n2:38:34.840 --> 2:38:36.640\n and in my office at Princeton\n\n2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:39.000\n or my coming office at Stanford\n\n2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:41.840\n when I moved full time to Stanford in September.\n\n2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:46.840\n Or it's experienced far away in safety and in comfort.\n\n2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:50.840\n And we have to remember that too\n\n2:38:50.840 --> 2:38:52.400\n when we talk about these things,\n\n2:38:52.400 --> 2:38:55.040\n when we answer your questions, right?\n\n2:38:55.040 --> 2:38:58.120\n That as we speak and as we comment\n\n2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:00.360\n and think we're experts on these things\n\n2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:02.480\n from the comfort of our existence,\n\n2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:07.280\n that there are people in those tragedies right now.\n\n2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:09.120\n With no power, with no food,\n\n2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:12.560\n with no, with full uncertainty about the future\n\n2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:14.280\n of the health of their children.\n\n2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:15.400\n That's it.\n\n2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:19.920\n And I've also seen, because I have family in both places,\n\n2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:24.200\n homes that were home for,\n\n2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:28.360\n buildings that were homes for generations now in rubble.\n\n2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:30.440\n So.\n\n2:39:30.440 --> 2:39:33.080\n Yes, Lex, it just, it hurts.\n\n2:39:33.080 --> 2:39:36.200\n And it's, let's, it's Syria,\n\n2:39:36.200 --> 2:39:41.160\n where 350,000 at least by UN estimates died\n\n2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:43.880\n and Russia participated in that.\n\n2:39:43.880 --> 2:39:45.800\n And it's Yemen.\n\n2:39:45.800 --> 2:39:47.840\n And it's so many other places\n\n2:39:47.840 --> 2:39:50.560\n that don't have the same degree of attention\n\n2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:53.200\n that a European country like Ukraine has.\n\n2:39:54.400 --> 2:39:57.880\n But yeah, we have to remember also\n\n2:39:57.880 --> 2:40:00.480\n that in addition to Ukraine,\n\n2:40:00.480 --> 2:40:04.560\n and then there's things right home here in New York City\n\n2:40:04.560 --> 2:40:07.160\n where children are without food.\n\n2:40:07.160 --> 2:40:10.960\n Which is just inexcusable in a country this rich.\n\n2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:13.520\n So we shouldn't forget in our study of leaders\n\n2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:15.000\n and our study of geopolitics\n\n2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:16.720\n that ultimately it's about the humanity.\n\n2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:18.160\n It's about the human beings and.\n\n2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:19.680\n That's it.\n\n2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:20.680\n Okay, Lex.\n\n2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:21.640\n Human suffering.\n\n2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:22.480\n Thank you so much, Stephen.\n\n2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:23.320\n Thank you.\n\n2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:24.720\n This is an amazing conversation.\n\n2:40:24.720 --> 2:40:25.880\n Talk to you again soon.\n\n2:40:25.880 --> 2:40:26.720\n My pleasure.\n\n2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:29.240\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:31.040\n with Stephen Kotkin.\n\n2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:32.400\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:40:32.400 --> 2:40:35.440\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:40:35.440 --> 2:40:38.360\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n2:40:38.360 --> 2:40:39.720\n from Mahatma Gandhi.\n\n2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:44.800\n When I despair, I remember that all through history,\n\n2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:47.200\n the way of truth and love have always won.\n\n2:40:48.280 --> 2:40:50.800\n There have been tyrants and murderers\n\n2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:54.040\n and for a time they can seem invincible,\n\n2:40:54.040 --> 2:40:56.600\n but in the end, they always fall.\n\n2:40:56.600 --> 2:41:01.600\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
