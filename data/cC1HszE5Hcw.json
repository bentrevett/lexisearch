philosophy of mind.\n\n00:09.400 --> 00:15.320\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast, to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n00:15.320 --> 00:20.320\n And now, here's my conversation with Sean Kelly.\n\n00:20.320 --> 00:28.600\n Your interests are in postcontinent European philosophy, especially phenomenology and existentialism.\n\n00:28.600 --> 00:34.200\n So let me ask, what to you is existentialism?\n\n00:34.200 --> 00:36.060\n So it's a hard question.\n\n00:36.060 --> 00:38.480\n I'm teaching a course on existentialism right now.\n\n00:38.480 --> 00:39.480\n You are.\n\n00:39.480 --> 00:40.640\n I am, yeah.\n\n00:40.640 --> 00:43.720\n Existentialism in literature and film, which is fun.\n\n00:43.720 --> 00:50.920\n I mean, the traditional thing to say about what existentialism is, is that it's a movement\n\n00:50.920 --> 00:58.000\n in mid 20th century, mostly French, some German philosophy, and some of the major figures\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:05.400\n associated with it are people like Jean Paul Sartre and Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, maybe\n\n01:05.400 --> 01:10.680\n Martin Heidegger, but that's a weird thing to say about it because most of those people\n\n01:10.680 --> 01:14.240\n denied that they were existentialists.\n\n01:14.240 --> 01:19.880\n And in fact, I think of it as a movement that has a much longer history.\n\n01:19.880 --> 01:26.120\n So when I try to describe what the core idea of existentialism is, it's an idea that you\n\n01:26.120 --> 01:29.560\n find expressed in different ways in a bunch of these people.\n\n01:29.560 --> 01:37.380\n One of the ways that it's expressed is that Sartre will say that existentialism is the\n\n01:37.380 --> 01:44.940\n view that there is no God, at least his form of existentialism, he calls it atheistic existentialism.\n\n01:44.940 --> 01:46.840\n There is no God.\n\n01:46.840 --> 01:52.660\n And since there's no God, there must be some other being around who does something like\n\n01:52.660 --> 01:59.440\n what God does, otherwise there wouldn't be any possibility for significance in a life.\n\n01:59.440 --> 02:06.680\n And that being is us and the feature of us according to Sartre and the other existentialists\n\n02:06.680 --> 02:11.220\n that puts us in the position to be able to play that role is that we're the beings for\n\n02:11.220 --> 02:18.120\n whom as Sartre says it, existence precedes essence.\n\n02:18.120 --> 02:21.520\n That's the catchphrase for existentialism and then you have to try to figure out what\n\n02:21.520 --> 02:23.560\n it means.\n\n02:23.560 --> 02:24.560\n What is existence?\n\n02:24.560 --> 02:25.560\n What is presence?\n\n02:25.560 --> 02:26.560\n And what does precedes mean?\n\n02:26.560 --> 02:27.560\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n02:27.560 --> 02:28.560\n What is existence?\n\n02:28.560 --> 02:29.560\n What is essence?\n\n02:29.560 --> 02:30.560\n And what is precedes?\n\n02:30.560 --> 02:34.840\n And in fact, precedes is Sartre's way of talking about it and other people will talk about\n\n02:34.840 --> 02:35.840\n it differently.\n\n02:35.840 --> 02:38.340\n But here's the way Sartre thinks about it.\n\n02:38.340 --> 02:42.580\n This is not, I think, the most interesting way to think about it, but it gets you started.\n\n02:42.580 --> 02:52.680\n Sartre says there's nothing true about what it is to be you until you start existing and\n\n02:52.680 --> 02:54.640\n still use until you start living.\n\n02:54.640 --> 03:01.120\n And for Sartre, the core feature of what it is to be existing the way we do is to be making\n\n03:01.120 --> 03:07.460\n decisions, to be making choices in your life, to be sort of taking a stand on what it is\n\n03:07.460 --> 03:11.760\n to be you by deciding to do this or that.\n\n03:11.760 --> 03:18.840\n And the key feature of how to do that right for Sartre is to do it in the full recognition\n\n03:18.840 --> 03:25.700\n of the fact that when you make that choice, nobody is responsible for it other than you.\n\n03:25.700 --> 03:28.880\n So you don't make the choice because God tells you to.\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:35.000\n You don't make the choice because some utilitarian calculus about what it's right to do tells\n\n03:35.000 --> 03:36.200\n you to do.\n\n03:36.200 --> 03:41.020\n You don't make the choice because some other philosophical theory tells you to do it.\n\n03:41.020 --> 03:46.120\n There's literally nothing on the basis of which you make the choice other than the fact\n\n03:46.120 --> 03:50.320\n that in that moment, you are the one making it.\n\n03:50.320 --> 03:54.460\n You are a conscious thinking being that made a decision.\n\n03:54.460 --> 03:59.600\n So all of the questions about physics and free will are out the window.\n\n03:59.600 --> 04:00.680\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n04:00.680 --> 04:05.420\n If you were a determinist about the mind, if you were a physicalist about the mind,\n\n04:05.420 --> 04:11.680\n if you thought there was nothing to your choices other than the activity of the brain that's\n\n04:11.680 --> 04:19.200\n governed by physical laws, then there's some sense in which it would seem at any rate like\n\n04:19.200 --> 04:21.060\n you are not the ground of that choice.\n\n04:21.060 --> 04:24.800\n The ground of that choice was the physical universe and the laws that govern it, and\n\n04:24.800 --> 04:26.560\n then you'd have no responsibility.\n\n04:26.560 --> 04:31.140\n And so Sartre's view is that the thing that's special about us used to be special about\n\n04:31.140 --> 04:39.060\n God is that we're responsible for becoming the being that makes the choices that we do.\n\n04:39.060 --> 04:44.580\n And Sartre thinks that that's simultaneously empowering, I mean, it practically puts us\n\n04:44.580 --> 04:50.460\n in the place of God, and also terrifying because what responsibility?\n\n04:50.460 --> 04:54.220\n How can you possibly take on that responsibility?\n\n04:54.220 --> 04:55.600\n And he thinks it's worse than that.\n\n04:55.600 --> 05:03.020\n He thinks that it's always happening, everything that you do is the result of some choice that\n\n05:03.020 --> 05:09.040\n you've made, the posture that you sit in, the way you hold someone's gaze when you're\n\n05:09.040 --> 05:16.420\n having a conversation with them or not, the choice to make a note when someone says something\n\n05:16.420 --> 05:19.040\n or not make a note.\n\n05:19.040 --> 05:23.660\n Everything that you do presents you as a being who makes decisions and you're responsible\n\n05:23.660 --> 05:24.660\n for all of them.\n\n05:24.660 --> 05:27.060\n So it's constantly happening.\n\n05:27.060 --> 05:35.220\n And furthermore, there's no fact about you independent of the choices and actions you've\n\n05:35.220 --> 05:36.220\n performed.\n\n05:36.220 --> 05:41.100\n So you don't get to say, Sartre's example, I really am a great writer, just haven't written\n\n05:41.100 --> 05:42.100\n my great book yet.\n\n05:42.100 --> 05:46.260\n If you haven't written your great book, you're not a great writer.\n\n05:46.260 --> 05:53.500\n And so it's terrifying, it puts a huge burden on us, and that's why Sartre says on his view\n\n05:53.500 --> 05:59.340\n of existentialism, human beings are the beings that are condemned to be free.\n\n05:59.340 --> 06:04.260\n Our freedom consists in our ability and our responsibility to make these choices and to\n\n06:04.260 --> 06:06.820\n become someone through making them.\n\n06:06.820 --> 06:08.620\n And we can't get away from that.\n\n06:08.620 --> 06:14.740\n But to him, it's terrifying not liberating in the positive meaning of the word liberating.\n\n06:14.740 --> 06:19.580\n Well, so he thinks it should be liberating, but he thinks that it takes a very courageous\n\n06:19.580 --> 06:22.180\n individual to be liberated by it.\n\n06:22.180 --> 06:24.860\n Nietzsche, I think, thought something similar.\n\n06:24.860 --> 06:29.940\n I think Sartre is really coming out of a Nietzschean sort of tradition.\n\n06:29.940 --> 06:36.660\n But what's liberating about it, if it is, is also terrifying because it means in a certain\n\n06:36.660 --> 06:39.500\n way, you're the ground of your own being.\n\n06:39.500 --> 06:43.100\n You become what you do through existing.\n\n06:43.100 --> 06:47.620\n So that's one form of existentialism, that's a stark atheistic version of it.\n\n06:47.620 --> 06:53.700\n There's lots of other versions, but it's somehow organized around the idea that it's through\n\n06:53.700 --> 06:56.140\n living your life that you become who you are.\n\n06:56.140 --> 07:01.920\n It's not facts that are sort of true about you independent of your living your life.\n\n07:01.920 --> 07:07.660\n But then there's no God in that view.\n\n07:07.660 --> 07:10.180\n Does any of the decisions matter?\n\n07:10.180 --> 07:14.180\n So how does existentialism differ from nihilism?\n\n07:14.180 --> 07:15.180\n Good.\n\n07:15.180 --> 07:16.180\n Okay.\n\n07:16.180 --> 07:17.180\n Great question.\n\n07:17.180 --> 07:20.900\n So it's two different ways that you're asking it.\n\n07:20.900 --> 07:26.540\n Let me leave nihilism to the side for just a second and think about mattering or is there\n\n07:26.540 --> 07:32.900\n any way that you can criticize someone for living the way they do if you're in existentialism?\n\n07:32.900 --> 07:34.020\n Including yourself.\n\n07:34.020 --> 07:35.020\n Including yourself.\n\n07:35.020 --> 07:36.020\n Yeah.\n\n07:36.020 --> 07:42.020\n Sartre addresses that and he says, yes, he says, there is a criticism that you can make\n\n07:42.020 --> 07:47.620\n of yourself or of others and it's the criticism of living in such a way as to fail to take\n\n07:47.620 --> 07:50.280\n responsibility for your choices.\n\n07:50.280 --> 07:54.060\n He gives these two sort of amazing examples.\n\n07:54.060 --> 07:55.060\n One doesn't...\n\n07:55.060 --> 08:02.160\n I don't know if it reads as well for us as it did in sort of mid 20th century Paris,\n\n08:02.160 --> 08:04.280\n but it's about a waiter.\n\n08:04.280 --> 08:07.380\n He gives this in his big book, Being and Nothingness.\n\n08:07.380 --> 08:14.100\n And he says, so waiters played, still do I think in a certain way in Paris, a big role\n\n08:14.100 --> 08:15.700\n in Parisian society.\n\n08:15.700 --> 08:22.620\n To be a waiter involved having a certain kind of identity, being a certain way, taking control\n\n08:22.620 --> 08:28.820\n of and charge of the experience of the people that you're waiting on, but also really being\n\n08:28.820 --> 08:33.780\n the authority, knowing that this is the way it's supposed to go.\n\n08:33.780 --> 08:40.700\n And so Sartre imagines a waiter who does everything that a waiter is supposed to do, the perfect\n\n08:40.700 --> 08:48.860\n form of the waiter, except that you can somehow see in the way he's doing it that he's doing\n\n08:48.860 --> 08:54.900\n it because he believes that's the way a waiter should act.\n\n08:54.900 --> 09:00.540\n So there's some sense in which he's passing off the responsibility for his actions onto\n\n09:00.540 --> 09:03.180\n some idea of what those actions should be.\n\n09:03.180 --> 09:05.300\n He's not taking responsibility for it.\n\n09:05.300 --> 09:11.640\n He's sort of playing a role and the contours of the role are predetermined by someone other\n\n09:11.640 --> 09:12.900\n than him.\n\n09:12.900 --> 09:20.020\n So he starts as acting in bad faith and that's criticizable because it's acting in such a\n\n09:20.020 --> 09:25.500\n way as to fail to take responsibility for the kind of being Sartre thinks you are.\n\n09:25.500 --> 09:26.620\n So you're not taking responsibility.\n\n09:26.620 --> 09:28.040\n So that's one example.\n\n09:28.040 --> 09:34.940\n And I think any teenager, if you've ever met a teenager, you've known someone who does\n\n09:34.940 --> 09:35.940\n that.\n\n09:35.940 --> 09:36.940\n Teenagers try on roles.\n\n09:36.940 --> 09:41.300\n They think, if I dressed like this, I would be cool.\n\n09:41.300 --> 09:46.360\n So I'll dress like this, or if I spoke like this, or acted like this.\n\n09:46.360 --> 09:51.460\n And it's natural for a teenager who's trying to figure out what their identity is to go\n\n09:51.460 --> 09:52.460\n through a phase like that.\n\n09:52.460 --> 09:55.860\n But if you continue to do that, then you're really passing it.\n\n09:55.860 --> 09:56.860\n So that's one example.\n\n09:56.860 --> 10:06.140\n And the other example he gives is an example not of passing off responsibility by pretending\n\n10:06.140 --> 10:12.780\n that someone else is the ground of your choice, but passing off responsibility by pretending\n\n10:12.780 --> 10:16.940\n that you might be able to get away with not making a choice at all.\n\n10:16.940 --> 10:21.040\n So he says, everything you do is a result of your choices.\n\n10:21.040 --> 10:22.740\n And so he gives this other example.\n\n10:22.740 --> 10:28.580\n Where you are on the first date, first date.\n\n10:28.580 --> 10:37.460\n And the date, the evening reaches moments when it might be appropriate for one person\n\n10:37.460 --> 10:40.980\n to hold the hand of the other.\n\n10:40.980 --> 10:43.100\n That's the moment in the date where you are.\n\n10:43.100 --> 10:45.080\n And so you make a choice.\n\n10:45.080 --> 10:50.300\n You decide, I think it's that time, and you hold the hand.\n\n10:50.300 --> 10:54.260\n And what should happen is that the other person also makes a choice on Sartre's view.\n\n10:54.260 --> 11:00.180\n Either they reject the hand, not that time, and I'm taking responsibility for that, or\n\n11:00.180 --> 11:02.820\n they grasp the hand back.\n\n11:02.820 --> 11:03.820\n That's a choice.\n\n11:03.820 --> 11:08.760\n But there's a thing that sometimes happens, which is that the other person leaves the\n\n11:08.760 --> 11:15.180\n hand there cold, dead, and clammy, neither rejecting it nor embracing it.\n\n11:15.180 --> 11:21.940\n And Sartre says, that's also bad faith, that's also acting as if we're a kind of being that\n\n11:21.940 --> 11:27.780\n we're not, because it pretends that it's possible not to make a choice.\n\n11:27.780 --> 11:29.640\n And we're the beings who are always making choices.\n\n11:29.640 --> 11:31.420\n That was a choice.\n\n11:31.420 --> 11:35.340\n And you're pretending as if it's the kind of thing that you don't have to take responsibility\n\n11:35.340 --> 11:36.340\n for.\n\n11:36.340 --> 11:41.020\n So both of the examples you've given, there's some sense in which the social interactions\n\n11:41.020 --> 11:49.460\n between humans is a kind of moving away from the full responsibility that you as a human\n\n11:49.460 --> 11:52.700\n in the view of existentialism should take on.\n\n11:52.700 --> 11:59.500\n So isn't the basic conversation, a delegation of responsibility, just holding a hand there,\n\n11:59.500 --> 12:04.420\n you're putting some of the responsibility into the court of the other person.\n\n12:04.420 --> 12:12.500\n And for the waiter, if you exist in a society, you are generally trying on a role.\n\n12:12.500 --> 12:15.100\n I mean, all of us are trying on a role.\n\n12:15.100 --> 12:21.420\n Me wearing clothes is me trying on a role that I was told to try, as opposed to walking\n\n12:21.420 --> 12:23.660\n around naked all the time.\n\n12:23.660 --> 12:31.460\n There's standards of how you operate, and that's a decision that's not my own.\n\n12:31.460 --> 12:34.580\n It's me seeing what everyone else is doing and copying them.\n\n12:34.580 --> 12:35.940\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n12:35.940 --> 12:43.500\n So Sartre thinks that in the ideal, you should try to resist that.\n\n12:43.500 --> 12:51.860\n Other existentialists think that that's actually a clue to how you should live well.\n\n12:51.860 --> 12:56.260\n So Sartre says somewhere else, hell is other people.\n\n12:56.260 --> 12:57.940\n Why is hell other people for Sartre?\n\n12:57.940 --> 13:01.340\n Well, because other people are making choices also.\n\n13:01.340 --> 13:09.260\n And when other people make choices, they put some pressure on me to think that the choice\n\n13:09.260 --> 13:17.220\n they made is one that I should copy or one that I should promote.\n\n13:17.220 --> 13:21.780\n But if I do it because they did it, then I'm in bad faith for Sartre.\n\n13:21.780 --> 13:27.340\n So it is as if Sartre's view is like, we would be better if we were all alone.\n\n13:27.340 --> 13:32.900\n I mean, this is really simplifying Sartre's position, and this is really just mostly Sartre\n\n13:32.900 --> 13:36.740\n in a certain period of his formation.\n\n13:36.740 --> 13:39.100\n But anyhow, we can imagine that view.\n\n13:39.100 --> 13:43.540\n And I think there's something to the idea that Sartre is attracted to it, at least in\n\n13:43.540 --> 13:44.540\n the mid 40s.\n\n13:44.540 --> 13:46.680\n Can you dig into hell as other people?\n\n13:46.680 --> 13:53.620\n Is there some, obviously, it's kind of almost like a literary, like you push the point strongly\n\n13:53.620 --> 13:56.040\n to really explore that point.\n\n13:56.040 --> 14:01.940\n But is there some sense in that other people ruin the experience of what it means to be\n\n14:01.940 --> 14:03.340\n human?\n\n14:03.340 --> 14:08.340\n I think for Sartre, the phenomenon is this, like, it's not just that you wear clothes\n\n14:08.340 --> 14:13.020\n because people wear clothes in our society, like you have a particular style, you wear\n\n14:13.020 --> 14:15.340\n a particular kind of clothes.\n\n14:15.340 --> 14:22.460\n And for Sartre, like to have that style authentically, in good faith, rather than in bad faith, it\n\n14:22.460 --> 14:25.980\n has to come from you, you have to make the choice.\n\n14:25.980 --> 14:30.660\n But other people are making choices also, and like, you're looking at their choices\n\n14:30.660 --> 14:35.500\n and you're thinking, that guy looks good, maybe I could try that one on.\n\n14:35.500 --> 14:41.080\n And if you try it on because you were influenced by the fact that you thought that guy was\n\n14:41.080 --> 14:45.220\n doing it well, then there's some important sense in which, although that's a resource\n\n14:45.220 --> 14:50.880\n for a choice for you, it's also acting in bad faith.\n\n14:50.880 --> 14:53.120\n And God wouldn't do that, right?\n\n14:53.120 --> 14:58.660\n God wouldn't be influenced by other's decisions, and if that's the model, then I think that's\n\n14:58.660 --> 15:00.660\n the sense in which he thinks hell is other people.\n\n15:00.660 --> 15:02.740\n What do you think parenting is then?\n\n15:02.740 --> 15:08.540\n It's like, what, because God doesn't have a parent, so aren't we significantly influenced,\n\n15:08.540 --> 15:16.580\n first of all, in the first few years of life, and even the teenager is resisting, like,\n\n15:16.580 --> 15:18.580\n learning through resistance.\n\n15:18.580 --> 15:19.580\n Absolutely.\n\n15:19.580 --> 15:28.060\n I mean, I think what you're pushing on is the intuition that the ideal that Sartre's\n\n15:28.060 --> 15:31.580\n aiming at is a kind of inhuman ideal.\n\n15:31.580 --> 15:37.860\n I mean, there's many ways in which we're not like the traditional view of what God was.\n\n15:37.860 --> 15:46.740\n One is that we're not self generating, we have parents, we were raised into traditions\n\n15:46.740 --> 15:53.700\n and social norms, and we're raised into an understanding of what's appropriate and inappropriate\n\n15:53.700 --> 15:55.740\n to do.\n\n15:55.740 --> 15:58.140\n And I think that's a deep intuition.\n\n15:58.140 --> 16:01.380\n I think that's exactly right.\n\n16:01.380 --> 16:06.340\n Martin Heidegger, who's the philosopher that Sartre thinks he's sort of taking this from,\n\n16:06.340 --> 16:13.740\n but I think Sartre's a kind of brilliant French misinterpretation of Heidegger's German phenomenological\n\n16:13.740 --> 16:20.860\n view, Heidegger says, a crucial aspect of what it is to be us is our thrownness.\n\n16:20.860 --> 16:27.540\n We're thrown into a situation, we're thrown into history, we're thrown into our parental\n\n16:27.540 --> 16:30.340\n lineage, and we don't choose it.\n\n16:30.340 --> 16:33.420\n That's stuff that we don't choose, we couldn't choose.\n\n16:33.420 --> 16:37.860\n If we were God and we existed outside of time, maybe, but we're not.\n\n16:37.860 --> 16:42.940\n We're finite in the sense that we have a beginning that we never chose.\n\n16:42.940 --> 16:50.300\n We have an end that we're often trying to resist or put off or something, and in between\n\n16:50.300 --> 16:55.340\n there's a whole bunch of stuff that organizes us without our ever having made the choice\n\n16:55.340 --> 17:00.740\n and without the kind of being that could make the choice to allow it to organize us.\n\n17:00.740 --> 17:05.900\n We have a complicated relationship to that stuff, and I think we should talk about that\n\n17:05.900 --> 17:06.900\n at a certain point.\n\n17:06.900 --> 17:12.460\n But the first move is to say, Sartre's just got a sort of descriptive problem.\n\n17:12.460 --> 17:22.940\n He's missed this basic fact that there has to be an awful lot about us that's settled\n\n17:22.940 --> 17:25.500\n without our having made the choice to settle it that way.\n\n17:25.500 --> 17:29.380\n Right, the thrownness of life.\n\n17:29.380 --> 17:32.260\n That's a fundamental part of life, you can't just escape it.\n\n17:32.260 --> 17:33.260\n Exactly.\n\n17:33.260 --> 17:34.260\n You can't escape it altogether.\n\n17:34.260 --> 17:35.260\n Altogether.\n\n17:35.260 --> 17:36.260\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n17:36.260 --> 17:37.540\n You can't escape it altogether.\n\n17:37.540 --> 17:42.900\n But nevertheless, you are riding a wave and you make a decision in the riding of the wave.\n\n17:42.900 --> 17:49.060\n You can't control the wave, but you should be, as you ride it, you should be making certain\n\n17:49.060 --> 17:53.120\n kinds of decisions and take responsibility for it.\n\n17:53.120 --> 17:59.100\n So why does this matter at all, the chain of decisions you make?\n\n17:59.100 --> 18:00.100\n Good.\n\n18:00.100 --> 18:01.180\n Well, because they constitute you.\n\n18:01.180 --> 18:03.300\n They make you the person that you are.\n\n18:03.300 --> 18:06.720\n So what's the opposite view?\n\n18:06.720 --> 18:08.820\n What's this view against?\n\n18:08.820 --> 18:14.700\n This view is against most of philosophy from Plato forward.\n\n18:14.700 --> 18:21.340\n Plato says in the Republic, it's a kind of myth, but he says, people will understand\n\n18:21.340 --> 18:24.700\n their condition well if we tell them this myth.\n\n18:24.700 --> 18:28.980\n He says, look, when you're born, there's just a fact about you.\n\n18:28.980 --> 18:33.340\n Your soul is either gold, silver, or bronze.\n\n18:33.340 --> 18:36.820\n Those are the three kinds of people there are, and you're born that way.\n\n18:36.820 --> 18:42.220\n And if your soul is gold, then we should identify that and make you a philosopher king.\n\n18:42.220 --> 18:45.800\n And if your soul is silver, well, you're not gonna be a philosopher king.\n\n18:45.800 --> 18:49.540\n You're not capable of it, but you could be a good warrior and we should make you that.\n\n18:49.540 --> 18:53.540\n And if your soul is bronze, then you should be a farmer, laborer, something like that.\n\n18:53.540 --> 19:00.420\n And that's a fact about you that identifies you forever and for always, independent of\n\n19:00.420 --> 19:03.120\n anything you do about it.\n\n19:03.120 --> 19:05.380\n And so that's the alternative view.\n\n19:05.380 --> 19:07.760\n And you could have modern versions of it.\n\n19:07.760 --> 19:15.120\n You could say the thing that identifies you is your IQ or your genetic makeup or the percentage\n\n19:15.120 --> 19:21.220\n of fast switch muscle fibers you've got or whatever, it could be something totally independent\n\n19:21.220 --> 19:25.080\n of any choice that you've made, independent of the kind of thing about which you could\n\n19:25.080 --> 19:29.540\n make a choice and it categorizes you.\n\n19:29.540 --> 19:31.020\n It makes you the person that you are.\n\n19:31.020 --> 19:35.420\n That's the thing that Sartre and the existentialists are against.\n\n19:35.420 --> 19:41.980\n So this idea that something about you is forever limiting the space of possible decisions you\n\n19:41.980 --> 19:42.980\n can make.\n\n19:42.980 --> 19:46.260\n Sartre says, no, the space is unlimited.\n\n19:46.260 --> 19:49.700\n Sartre is the philosopher of radical freedom.\n\n19:49.700 --> 19:50.700\n Radical freedom.\n\n19:50.700 --> 19:52.680\n Yeah, radical freedom.\n\n19:52.680 --> 19:58.620\n And then you could have other existentialists who say, look, we are free, but we gotta understand\n\n19:58.620 --> 20:02.820\n the way in which our freedom is limited by certain aspects of the kind of being that\n\n20:02.820 --> 20:03.820\n we are.\n\n20:03.820 --> 20:09.340\n If we were radically free, we really would be like God in the traditional medieval sense.\n\n20:09.340 --> 20:15.700\n And sort of these folks start with the idea that whatever we are, that's a kind of limit\n\n20:15.700 --> 20:17.980\n point that we're not gonna reach.\n\n20:17.980 --> 20:24.920\n So what are the ways in which we're constrained that that being the way the medieval's understood\n\n20:24.920 --> 20:26.780\n him wasn't constrained?\n\n20:26.780 --> 20:33.700\n So can you maybe comment on what is nihilism and is it at all a useful other sort of group\n\n20:33.700 --> 20:37.180\n of ideas that you resist against in defining existentialism?\n\n20:37.180 --> 20:38.180\n Yes.\n\n20:38.180 --> 20:39.180\n Good.\n\n20:39.180 --> 20:40.180\n Excellent.\n\n20:40.180 --> 20:45.180\n So nihilism, the philosopher who made the term popular, although it was used before\n\n20:45.180 --> 20:51.100\n him as Nietzsche, Nietzsche's writing in the end of the 19th century, in various places\n\n20:51.100 --> 21:00.260\n where he published things, but largely in his unpublished works, he identifies the condition\n\n21:00.260 --> 21:06.900\n of the modern world as nihilistic, and that's a descriptive claim.\n\n21:06.900 --> 21:14.820\n He's looking around him, trying to figure out what it's like to be us now, and he says\n\n21:14.820 --> 21:21.660\n it's a lot different from what it was like to be human in 1300 or in the 5th century\n\n21:21.660 --> 21:22.660\n BCE.\n\n21:22.660 --> 21:34.260\n In 1300, like what people believed, the way they lived their lives was in the understanding\n\n21:34.260 --> 21:38.500\n that to be human was to be created in the image and likeness of God.\n\n21:38.500 --> 21:40.500\n That's the way they understood themselves.\n\n21:40.500 --> 21:48.180\n And also to be created sinful because of Adam and Eve's transgression in the Garden of Eden,\n\n21:48.180 --> 21:54.320\n and to have the project of trying to understand how, as a sinful being, you could nevertheless\n\n21:54.320 --> 21:56.860\n live a virtuous life.\n\n21:56.860 --> 21:57.860\n How could you do that?\n\n21:57.860 --> 22:01.220\n And it had to do with, for them, getting in the right relation to God.\n\n22:01.220 --> 22:07.100\n Nietzsche says that doesn't make sense to us anymore in the end of the 19th century.\n\n22:07.100 --> 22:10.060\n God is dead, says Nietzsche famously.\n\n22:10.060 --> 22:11.060\n And what does that mean?\n\n22:11.060 --> 22:16.420\n Well, it means something like the role that God used to play in our understanding of ourselves\n\n22:16.420 --> 22:21.960\n as a culture isn't a role that God can play anymore.\n\n22:21.960 --> 22:27.900\n And so Nietzsche says the role that God used to play was the role of grounding our existence.\n\n22:27.900 --> 22:31.940\n He was what it is in virtue of which we are who we are.\n\n22:31.940 --> 22:37.660\n And Nietzsche says the idea that there is a being that makes us what we are doesn't\n\n22:37.660 --> 22:38.660\n make sense anymore.\n\n22:38.660 --> 22:41.260\n It's like Sartre's atheism, Sartre is taking that from Nietzsche.\n\n22:41.260 --> 22:46.420\n And so the question is, what does ground our existence?\n\n22:46.420 --> 22:49.340\n And the answer is Nihil, nothing.\n\n22:49.340 --> 22:55.300\n And so nihilism is the idea that there's nothing outside of us that grounds our existence.\n\n22:55.300 --> 22:59.980\n And then Nietzsche asked the question, well, what are we supposed to do about that?\n\n22:59.980 --> 23:02.260\n How do we live?\n\n23:02.260 --> 23:07.220\n And I think Nietzsche has a different story than Sartre about that.\n\n23:07.220 --> 23:12.940\n Nietzsche doesn't emphasize this notion of radical freedom.\n\n23:12.940 --> 23:15.220\n Nietzsche emphasizes something else.\n\n23:15.220 --> 23:19.340\n He says, we're artists of life.\n\n23:19.340 --> 23:25.860\n And artists are interesting because the natural way of thinking about artists is that they're\n\n23:25.860 --> 23:28.420\n responding to something.\n\n23:28.420 --> 23:32.260\n They find themselves in a situation and they say, this is what's going to make sense of\n\n23:32.260 --> 23:33.260\n the situation.\n\n23:33.260 --> 23:34.660\n This is what I have to write.\n\n23:34.660 --> 23:36.260\n This is the way I have to dance.\n\n23:36.260 --> 23:39.460\n This is the way I've got to play the music.\n\n23:39.460 --> 23:41.860\n And Nietzsche says, we should live like that.\n\n23:41.860 --> 23:48.980\n There are constraints, but understanding what they are is a complicated aspect of living\n\n23:48.980 --> 23:49.980\n itself.\n\n23:49.980 --> 23:56.900\n And there's a great story, I think, from music that maybe helps to understand this.\n\n23:56.900 --> 24:01.820\n I think Nietzsche, of course, jazz didn't exist when Nietzsche was writing, but I think\n\n24:01.820 --> 24:06.180\n Nietzsche really is thinking of something like jazz improvisation.\n\n24:06.180 --> 24:09.460\n He talks about improvisation, there's classical improvisation.\n\n24:09.460 --> 24:11.660\n Nietzsche was, by the way, a musician.\n\n24:11.660 --> 24:19.380\n He was a composer and a pianist, not a great one, really, to be fair, but he loved music.\n\n24:19.380 --> 24:26.200\n And Herbie Hancock, who's a pianist, a jazz pianist, who played with Miles Davis for quite\n\n24:26.200 --> 24:34.060\n a while in the 60s, tells this kind of incredible story that I think exemplifies Nietzsche's\n\n24:34.060 --> 24:44.500\n view about the way in which we bear some responsibility for being creative and that gives us a certain\n\n24:44.500 --> 24:50.780\n kind of freedom, but we don't have the radical freedom that Sartre thinks.\n\n24:50.780 --> 24:52.060\n So what's the story?\n\n24:52.060 --> 25:00.980\n Herbie Hancock says, I think they were in Stuttgart, he says, playing a show and things\n\n25:00.980 --> 25:03.020\n were great, he says.\n\n25:03.020 --> 25:08.260\n He's a young pianist and Miles Davis is the master.\n\n25:08.260 --> 25:14.300\n And he says, I'm back in the solo and I'm playing these chords.\n\n25:14.300 --> 25:22.860\n And he says, I played this chord and it was the wrong chord.\n\n25:22.860 --> 25:27.380\n He's like, that's what you got to say, it didn't work right there.\n\n25:27.380 --> 25:30.740\n And I thought, holy mackerel, I screwed up, I screwed up.\n\n25:30.740 --> 25:35.860\n We were tight, everything was working and I blew it for Miles, who's doing his solo.\n\n25:35.860 --> 25:46.900\n And he said, Miles paused for a moment and then all of a sudden he went on in a way that\n\n25:46.900 --> 25:51.900\n made my chord right.\n\n25:51.900 --> 25:58.220\n And I think that idea that you could be an artist who responds to what's thrown at you\n\n25:58.220 --> 26:05.500\n in such a way as to make it right, by what measure?\n\n26:05.500 --> 26:08.100\n Everyone could hear it, is all you can say, right?\n\n26:08.100 --> 26:11.640\n Everyone knew, wow, that really works.\n\n26:11.640 --> 26:16.340\n And I think that's not like, there are constraints, not anything would have worked there.\n\n26:16.340 --> 26:19.160\n He couldn't have just played anything.\n\n26:19.160 --> 26:23.420\n Most of what anyone would have played would have sounded terrible.\n\n26:23.420 --> 26:30.220\n But the constraints aren't preexisting, they're what's happening now in the moment for these\n\n26:30.220 --> 26:32.220\n listeners and these performers.\n\n26:32.220 --> 26:37.260\n And I think that's what Nietzsche thinks the right response to nihilism is, we're involved,\n\n26:37.260 --> 26:42.260\n but we're not radically free to make any choice and just stand behind it the way Sartre thinks.\n\n26:42.260 --> 26:47.820\n Our choices have to be responsive to our situation and they have to make the situation work.\n\n26:47.820 --> 26:50.020\n They have to make it right.\n\n26:50.020 --> 26:55.660\n And there's something about music too, so you basically have to make music of all the\n\n26:55.660 --> 26:57.700\n moments of life.\n\n26:57.700 --> 27:01.100\n And there is something about music, why is music so compelling?\n\n27:01.100 --> 27:06.580\n And when you listen to it, something about certain kinds of music, it connects with you.\n\n27:06.580 --> 27:07.580\n It doesn't make any sense.\n\n27:07.580 --> 27:14.100\n But in that same way, for Nietzsche, you should be a creative force that creates a musical\n\n27:14.100 --> 27:15.100\n masterpiece.\n\n27:15.100 --> 27:16.100\n Exactly.\n\n27:16.100 --> 27:19.940\n And I think what's interesting is the question, what does it mean to be a creative force there?\n\n27:19.940 --> 27:26.420\n There's a traditional notion of creation that we associate with God.\n\n27:26.420 --> 27:31.080\n God creates ex nihilo, out of nothing.\n\n27:31.080 --> 27:36.140\n And you might think that nihilism thinks that we should do that, create ex nihilo, because\n\n27:36.140 --> 27:38.500\n it's about how there's nothing at our ground.\n\n27:38.500 --> 27:43.260\n But I think the right way to read Nietzsche is to recognize that we don't create out of\n\n27:43.260 --> 27:44.260\n nothing.\n\n27:44.260 --> 27:49.860\n Miles Davis wasn't nothing, that situation preexisted him, it was given to him.\n\n27:49.860 --> 27:55.540\n Maybe by accident, maybe it was a mistake, whatever, but he was responding to that situation\n\n27:55.540 --> 27:57.500\n in a way that made it right.\n\n27:57.500 --> 28:01.700\n He wasn't just creating out of nothing, he was creating out of what was already there.\n\n28:01.700 --> 28:06.420\n So that makes that first date with the climbing hand even more complicated because you're\n\n28:06.420 --> 28:10.660\n given a climbing hand, you're going to have to make art and music out of that.\n\n28:10.660 --> 28:11.660\n Exactly.\n\n28:11.660 --> 28:13.900\n That's the responsibility for both of them.\n\n28:13.900 --> 28:19.620\n Wow, that's a lot of responsibility for a first date because you have to create.\n\n28:19.620 --> 28:26.180\n The emphasis isn't just on making decisions, it's on creating.\n\n28:26.180 --> 28:28.300\n But also on listening, right?\n\n28:28.300 --> 28:30.800\n I mean, Miles Davis was listening.\n\n28:30.800 --> 28:31.860\n He heard that.\n\n28:31.860 --> 28:32.860\n He knew it was wrong.\n\n28:32.860 --> 28:37.620\n And the question was, what do I play that makes it right?\n\n28:37.620 --> 28:42.060\n So let me ask about Nietzsche, is God dead?\n\n28:42.060 --> 28:43.940\n What did he mean by that statement?\n\n28:43.940 --> 28:50.300\n In your sense, the truth behind the question and the possible set of answers that our world\n\n28:50.300 --> 28:51.300\n today provides?\n\n28:51.300 --> 28:52.300\n Good.\n\n28:52.300 --> 28:59.220\n So, I mean, I think that there's something super perceptive about Nietzsche's diagnosis\n\n28:59.220 --> 29:02.460\n of the condition at the end of the 19th century.\n\n29:02.460 --> 29:08.340\n So not so far from the condition that I think we're currently in.\n\n29:08.340 --> 29:12.620\n And I think there's an interesting question what we're supposed to do in response.\n\n29:12.620 --> 29:14.880\n But what is the condition that we're currently in?\n\n29:14.880 --> 29:20.260\n When Nietzsche says God is dead, I think, like I was saying before, he means something\n\n29:20.260 --> 29:26.300\n like the role that God used to play in grounding our existence is not a role that works for\n\n29:26.300 --> 29:29.060\n us anymore as a culture.\n\n29:29.060 --> 29:34.700\n And when people talk about a view like that nowadays, they use a different terminology,\n\n29:34.700 --> 29:37.700\n but I think it's roughly what Nietzsche was aiming at.\n\n29:37.700 --> 29:40.620\n They say we live in a secular age.\n\n29:40.620 --> 29:42.020\n Our age is a secular age.\n\n29:42.020 --> 29:44.740\n And so what do people mean when they say that?\n\n29:44.740 --> 29:47.580\n I think, first of all, it's a descriptive claim.\n\n29:47.580 --> 29:48.900\n It could be wrong.\n\n29:48.900 --> 29:53.340\n The question is, does this really describe the way we experience ourselves as a culture\n\n29:53.340 --> 29:57.380\n or as a culture in the West or wherever it is that we are?\n\n29:57.380 --> 30:01.020\n So what does it mean to say that we live in a secular age, an age in which God is dead?\n\n30:01.020 --> 30:05.060\n Well, the first thing is it doesn't mean there are no religious believers because there are\n\n30:05.060 --> 30:06.060\n plenty.\n\n30:06.060 --> 30:12.540\n There are people who go to church or synagogue or mosque every week or more, and there are\n\n30:12.540 --> 30:19.500\n people who really find that to be an important aspect of the way they live their lives.\n\n30:19.500 --> 30:28.860\n But it does mean that for those people, the role that their religious belief plays in\n\n30:28.860 --> 30:32.400\n their life isn't the same as it used to be in previous ages.\n\n30:32.400 --> 30:34.180\n So what's that role?\n\n30:34.180 --> 30:35.860\n We'll go back to the high middle ages.\n\n30:35.860 --> 30:38.560\n That was clearly not a secular age.\n\n30:38.560 --> 30:40.940\n That was a religious age.\n\n30:40.940 --> 30:46.820\n And so there we are in 1300, Dante is writing The Divine Comedy or something.\n\n30:46.820 --> 30:50.260\n And what did it mean then to live in a sacred age?\n\n30:50.260 --> 30:58.740\n Well, it meant not just that the default was that you were a Christian in the West, but\n\n30:58.740 --> 31:06.660\n that your Christianity, your religious belief, your religious affiliation justified certain\n\n31:06.660 --> 31:11.020\n assumptions about people who didn't share that religious belief.\n\n31:11.020 --> 31:19.140\n So you're a Christian in the West in 1300, and you meet someone who's a Muslim, and the\n\n31:19.140 --> 31:24.940\n fact that they don't share your religious belief justifies the conclusion that they're\n\n31:24.940 --> 31:27.400\n less than human.\n\n31:27.400 --> 31:30.460\n And that was the ground of the Crusades.\n\n31:30.460 --> 31:35.620\n That was the religious wars of the high middle ages.\n\n31:35.620 --> 31:40.940\n To say that we live in a secular age is to say that, not that there aren't a lot of people\n\n31:40.940 --> 31:45.660\n who have religious belief, there are, but it's to say that their religious belief doesn't\n\n31:45.660 --> 31:49.140\n justify that conclusion.\n\n31:49.140 --> 31:57.100\n If you're a religious believer and you meet me and suppose I'm not a religious believer,\n\n31:57.100 --> 32:02.540\n concerning that about me doesn't justify your concluding that I'm less than human.\n\n32:02.540 --> 32:06.140\n And that's the kind of liberalism of the modern age.\n\n32:06.140 --> 32:08.380\n Most of the time we think that's a good thing.\n\n32:08.380 --> 32:10.420\n We let a thousand flowers bloom.\n\n32:10.420 --> 32:13.120\n There are lots of ways to live a good life.\n\n32:13.120 --> 32:18.360\n And there's some way in which that is a nice progressive kind of liberal thought.\n\n32:18.360 --> 32:24.340\n But it's also true that it's an undermining thought because it means if you're a religious\n\n32:24.340 --> 32:32.140\n believer now, your belief can't ground your understanding of what you ought to be aiming\n\n32:32.140 --> 32:35.580\n at in the life in the way it used to be able to.\n\n32:35.580 --> 32:40.780\n You can't say, as a religious believer, I know it's right to do this.\n\n32:40.780 --> 32:44.420\n Because you also know that if you meet someone who doesn't share that religious belief and\n\n32:44.420 --> 32:50.180\n so doesn't think it's right to do that necessarily or does, but for different reasons, you can't\n\n32:50.180 --> 32:52.860\n conclude that they've got it wrong.\n\n32:52.860 --> 32:55.940\n So there's this sort of unsettling aspect to it.\n\n32:55.940 --> 33:03.060\n Well, isn't it true that you can't conclude as a public statement to others, but within\n\n33:03.060 --> 33:12.980\n your own mind, it's almost like an existentialist version of belief, which is like you create\n\n33:12.980 --> 33:19.620\n the world and around you, like it doesn't matter what others believe.\n\n33:19.620 --> 33:23.660\n It's actually almost like empowering thought.\n\n33:23.660 --> 33:31.060\n So as opposed to the more traditional view of religion, where it's like a tribal idea,\n\n33:31.060 --> 33:33.300\n like where you share that idea together.\n\n33:33.300 --> 33:38.660\n Here you have the full, back to Sartre, full responsibility of your beliefs as well.\n\n33:38.660 --> 33:39.660\n Good, good.\n\n33:39.660 --> 33:44.340\n But what you're describing is not a religious believer, right?\n\n33:44.340 --> 33:49.540\n You're describing someone who's found in themselves the ground of their existence rather than\n\n33:49.540 --> 33:51.060\n in something outside of themselves.\n\n33:51.060 --> 33:57.300\n So the religious belief, I mean, if you go full Sartrean, then, well, you're not in a\n\n33:57.300 --> 34:03.240\n position to criticize others for the choices that they make, but you are in a position\n\n34:03.240 --> 34:08.180\n to criticize them for the way in which they make them, either taking responsibility or\n\n34:08.180 --> 34:10.700\n not taking responsibility.\n\n34:10.700 --> 34:15.140\n But the religious believer used to be able to say, look, the choices that I make are\n\n34:15.140 --> 34:19.100\n right because God demands that I make them.\n\n34:19.100 --> 34:25.740\n And nowadays, and so it would be wrong to make any others.\n\n34:25.740 --> 34:32.980\n And nowadays, to say that we live in a secular age, say, well, you can't quite do that and\n\n34:32.980 --> 34:34.100\n be a religious believer.\n\n34:34.100 --> 34:40.380\n Your religious belief can't justify that move, and so it can't ground your life in the way\n\n34:40.380 --> 34:41.380\n it does.\n\n34:41.380 --> 34:42.380\n So it's sort of unsettling.\n\n34:42.380 --> 34:46.380\n I think that's one of the interpretations of what Nietzsche might have meant when he\n\n34:46.380 --> 34:47.940\n said God is dead.\n\n34:47.940 --> 34:52.960\n God can't play the role for religious believers in our world that he used to.\n\n34:52.960 --> 34:54.740\n But we nevertheless find meaning.\n\n34:54.740 --> 35:00.140\n I mean, you don't see nihilism as a prevalent set of ideas that are overtaken in modern\n\n35:00.140 --> 35:01.140\n culture.\n\n35:01.140 --> 35:03.940\n So a secular world is still full of meaning.\n\n35:03.940 --> 35:04.940\n Good.\n\n35:04.940 --> 35:07.540\n Well, I think that's the interesting question.\n\n35:07.540 --> 35:12.580\n I think it's certainly possible for a secular world to be a world in which we live meaningful\n\n35:12.580 --> 35:22.700\n lives, worthwhile lives, lives that are worthy of respect and that we can be proud of aiming\n\n35:22.700 --> 35:24.260\n to live.\n\n35:24.260 --> 35:28.020\n But I think it is a hard question what we're doing when we do that.\n\n35:28.020 --> 35:31.020\n And that is the question of existence.\n\n35:31.020 --> 35:37.040\n What does it mean to exist in a way that brings us out at our best as the beings that we are?\n\n35:37.040 --> 35:40.980\n That's the question for existentialism.\n\n35:40.980 --> 35:49.020\n So besides Sartre, who to you is the most important existentialist to understand for\n\n35:49.020 --> 35:50.020\n others?\n\n35:50.020 --> 35:52.380\n What ideas in particular of theirs do you like?\n\n35:52.380 --> 35:54.980\n Maybe other existentialists, not just one.\n\n35:54.980 --> 35:55.980\n Yeah.\n\n35:55.980 --> 36:00.740\n So Sartre is the grounding, strong atheistic existentialism statement.\n\n36:00.740 --> 36:02.740\n Who else is there?\n\n36:02.740 --> 36:08.220\n So I'm teaching an existentialism course now, and I think the tradition goes back at least\n\n36:08.220 --> 36:10.760\n to the 17th century.\n\n36:10.760 --> 36:13.880\n And I'll just tell you some of the figures that I'm teaching there.\n\n36:13.880 --> 36:16.780\n We can talk about any of them that you like.\n\n36:16.780 --> 36:19.300\n The figure I start with is Pascal.\n\n36:19.300 --> 36:24.380\n Pascal, French mathematician from 17th century.\n\n36:24.380 --> 36:29.380\n He died, I'm terrible with dates, but I think 1661 or something like that, middle of the\n\n36:29.380 --> 36:31.100\n 17th century.\n\n36:31.100 --> 36:34.920\n Brilliant polymath, we have computer languages named after him.\n\n36:34.920 --> 36:39.040\n He built the first mechanical calculating machine.\n\n36:39.040 --> 36:46.380\n But he was also deeply invested in his understanding of what Christianity was.\n\n36:46.380 --> 36:54.040\n And he thought that everyone before him had really misunderstood what Christianity was,\n\n36:54.040 --> 37:01.020\n that they'd really attempted to think about it, not as a way of living a life, but as\n\n37:01.020 --> 37:06.800\n a set of beliefs that you can have and which you can justify.\n\n37:06.800 --> 37:11.900\n And I think that's the first move that's really pretty interesting.\n\n37:11.900 --> 37:17.620\n And then figures like Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky developed that move.\n\n37:17.620 --> 37:23.900\n All of those take themselves to be defending an interpretation of a certain kind of Christianity,\n\n37:23.900 --> 37:27.380\n an existential interpretation of Christianity.\n\n37:27.380 --> 37:32.620\n And then I think there are other figures, other theistic figures, figures like Camus\n\n37:32.620 --> 37:38.120\n and Fanon, who are mid 20th century figures.\n\n37:38.120 --> 37:41.940\n And then I'll just mention the figure who I think is the most interesting is Martin\n\n37:41.940 --> 37:42.940\n Heidegger.\n\n37:42.940 --> 37:45.540\n He's a complicated figure because...\n\n37:45.540 --> 37:51.820\n By the way, when you said, sorry to interrupt, that when you said Camus, you meant atheistic?\n\n37:51.820 --> 37:56.000\n I think that Camus is an atheistic existentialist, yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.\n\n37:56.000 --> 38:00.180\n So okay, so we got, it's like sports cards, we have the different existentialists.\n\n38:00.180 --> 38:04.020\n So maybe let's go to...\n\n38:04.020 --> 38:05.020\n You know what?\n\n38:05.020 --> 38:06.020\n Let's go to Dostoevsky.\n\n38:06.020 --> 38:07.020\n All right.\n\n38:07.020 --> 38:08.020\n Okay, let's do it.\n\n38:08.020 --> 38:11.180\n So my favorite novel of his is The Idiot.\n\n38:11.180 --> 38:15.640\n First of all, I see myself as the idiot and an idiot.\n\n38:15.640 --> 38:22.240\n And I love the optimism and the love the main character has for the world.\n\n38:22.240 --> 38:25.820\n So that just deeply connects with me as a novel.\n\n38:25.820 --> 38:33.340\n It comes from underground as well, but what ideas of Dostoevsky's do you think are existentialists?\n\n38:33.340 --> 38:36.660\n What ideas are formative to the whole existentialist movement?\n\n38:36.660 --> 38:37.660\n Excellent.\n\n38:37.660 --> 38:40.300\n So let me talk about The Brothers Karamazov.\n\n38:40.300 --> 38:43.500\n Partly because that's the last novel that Dostoevsky wrote.\n\n38:43.500 --> 38:48.460\n I think it's certainly one of the greatest novels of the 19th century, maybe the best.\n\n38:48.460 --> 38:50.020\n And I'm about to teach it in a few weeks.\n\n38:50.020 --> 38:53.020\n So I'm super excited about it.\n\n38:53.020 --> 38:54.820\n What is The Brothers Karamazov about?\n\n38:54.820 --> 38:58.900\n I mean, without spoiling the ending for anyone.\n\n38:58.900 --> 38:59.900\n Spoiler alert.\n\n38:59.900 --> 39:00.900\n Yeah.\n\n39:00.900 --> 39:02.900\n I mean, look, it's a murder mystery, right?\n\n39:02.900 --> 39:06.380\n I mean, the father gets murdered.\n\n39:06.380 --> 39:08.180\n And the question is, who did it?\n\n39:08.180 --> 39:09.540\n Who's responsible for it?\n\n39:09.540 --> 39:12.860\n So there's a notion of responsibility here, like in Sartre.\n\n39:12.860 --> 39:17.740\n But it's responsibility for a murder, that's what we're talking about.\n\n39:17.740 --> 39:25.980\n And there's a bunch of brothers, each of whom has pretty good motivation for having murdered\n\n39:25.980 --> 39:26.980\n the father.\n\n39:26.980 --> 39:28.060\n The father's a jerk.\n\n39:28.060 --> 39:34.540\n I mean, if anybody is worthy of being murdered, he's the guy.\n\n39:34.540 --> 39:38.820\n He's a force of chaos and he's nasty in all sorts of ways.\n\n39:38.820 --> 39:44.140\n But still, it's not good to murder people.\n\n39:44.140 --> 39:46.260\n So what's the view of Dostoevsky?\n\n39:46.260 --> 39:54.380\n I mean, it's this intense exploration of what it means to be involved in various ways with\n\n39:54.380 --> 40:00.220\n an activity that everyone can recognize as atrocious.\n\n40:00.220 --> 40:05.500\n And what the right way is to take responsibility for that?\n\n40:05.500 --> 40:10.140\n What the right way is to relate to others in the face of it?\n\n40:10.140 --> 40:16.780\n And how, even through this kind of action, you can achieve some kind of salvation.\n\n40:16.780 --> 40:19.800\n That's Dostoevsky's word for it.\n\n40:19.800 --> 40:27.960\n But salvation here and now, not like you live some afterlife where you're paradise for eternity.\n\n40:27.960 --> 40:31.260\n Who cares about that, says one of the characters.\n\n40:31.260 --> 40:35.980\n That doesn't make my life now any good and it doesn't justify any of the bad things that\n\n40:35.980 --> 40:37.240\n happen in my life now.\n\n40:37.240 --> 40:42.940\n What matters is can we live well in the face of these things that we do and have to take\n\n40:42.940 --> 40:43.940\n responsibility for?\n\n40:43.940 --> 40:52.000\n So it's this intense exploration of notions and gradations of guilt and responsibility\n\n40:52.000 --> 40:56.300\n and the possibility of love and salvation in the face of those.\n\n40:56.300 --> 40:59.840\n It is incredibly human work.\n\n40:59.840 --> 41:03.260\n But I think Dostoevsky is the opposite of Sartre.\n\n41:03.260 --> 41:04.260\n And let me just...\n\n41:04.260 --> 41:05.260\n I think it's so fascinating.\n\n41:05.260 --> 41:07.860\n I don't know anybody else who notices this.\n\n41:07.860 --> 41:14.860\n But Sartre actually quotes a passage from Dostoevsky when he's developing his view.\n\n41:14.860 --> 41:15.860\n It's close to a passage.\n\n41:15.860 --> 41:18.100\n It doesn't appear quite in this way.\n\n41:18.100 --> 41:21.900\n But the passage that Sartre quotes is this.\n\n41:21.900 --> 41:23.180\n It's in the form of an argument.\n\n41:23.180 --> 41:24.780\n Sartre puts it in the form of argument.\n\n41:24.780 --> 41:29.800\n He says, look, there's a conditional statement is true.\n\n41:29.800 --> 41:34.020\n If there is no God, then everything is permitted.\n\n41:34.020 --> 41:36.340\n And then there's a second premise.\n\n41:36.340 --> 41:37.900\n There is no God.\n\n41:37.900 --> 41:38.900\n That's Sartre's view.\n\n41:38.900 --> 41:39.900\n I mean, he's an atheist.\n\n41:39.900 --> 41:41.900\n There is no God.\n\n41:41.900 --> 41:45.060\n Conclusion, everything is permitted.\n\n41:45.060 --> 41:47.940\n And that's Sartre's radical freedom.\n\n41:47.940 --> 41:52.640\n And if you think about the structure of the Brothers Karamazov, I think Dostoevsky, though\n\n41:52.640 --> 41:56.380\n he never says it this way, would run the argument differently.\n\n41:56.380 --> 41:59.460\n It's a modus tollens instead of a modus ponens.\n\n41:59.460 --> 42:02.460\n The argument for Dostoevsky would go like this.\n\n42:02.460 --> 42:07.100\n Yeah, conditional statement, if there is no God, then everything is permitted.\n\n42:07.100 --> 42:09.500\n But look at your life.\n\n42:09.500 --> 42:11.940\n Not everything is permitted.\n\n42:11.940 --> 42:17.700\n You do horrible, atrocious things like be involved in the death of your father.\n\n42:17.700 --> 42:19.340\n And there is a price to pay.\n\n42:19.340 --> 42:27.780\n That's not a livable moment to have to take responsibility, to have to recognize that\n\n42:27.780 --> 42:33.500\n you're at fault or you're somehow guilty for having been involved in whatever way you were\n\n42:33.500 --> 42:38.740\n in letting that happen or bringing it about that it does happen, is to pay a price.\n\n42:38.740 --> 42:44.680\n So we're not beings that are constituted in such a way that everything is permitted.\n\n42:44.680 --> 42:47.000\n Look at the facts of your existence.\n\n42:47.000 --> 42:50.100\n So not everything is permitted.\n\n42:50.100 --> 42:55.540\n Therefore there is a God.\n\n42:55.540 --> 43:00.380\n And the presence of a God for Dostoevsky, I think, is just found in this fact that when\n\n43:00.380 --> 43:05.180\n we do bad things, we feel guilty for them, that we find ourselves to be responsible for\n\n43:05.180 --> 43:09.420\n things even when we didn't intend to do them, but we just allowed ourselves to be involved\n\n43:09.420 --> 43:10.420\n in them.\n\n43:10.420 --> 43:13.380\n And the nature of God for Dostoevsky is, I mean, unclear.\n\n43:13.380 --> 43:17.060\n I mean, it's a very complex exploration in itself.\n\n43:17.060 --> 43:22.960\n And he basically, God speaks through several of his characters in complicated ways.\n\n43:22.960 --> 43:26.420\n So it's not like a trivial version of God.\n\n43:26.420 --> 43:27.500\n It's totally not trivial.\n\n43:27.500 --> 43:31.620\n And it's not a being that exists outside of time.\n\n43:31.620 --> 43:33.740\n None of that is sort of relevant for Dostoevsky.\n\n43:33.740 --> 43:36.700\n For him, it's a question about how we live our lives.\n\n43:36.700 --> 43:40.740\n Do we live our lives in the mood that Christianity says it makes available to us, which is the\n\n43:40.740 --> 43:42.820\n mood of joy?\n\n43:42.820 --> 43:50.860\n Is there, maybe this is a bit of a tangent, but so I'm a Russian speaker and one of the,\n\n43:50.860 --> 43:55.760\n I kind of listen to my heart and what my heart says is I need to take on this project.\n\n43:55.760 --> 44:03.420\n So there's a couple of famous translators of Dostoevsky and Tolstoy that live in Paris\n\n44:03.420 --> 44:04.420\n currently.\n\n44:04.420 --> 44:06.460\n So I'm going to take the journey.\n\n44:06.460 --> 44:12.820\n We agreed to have a full conversation about Dostoevsky, about Tolstoy and like a series\n\n44:12.820 --> 44:14.860\n of conversations.\n\n44:14.860 --> 44:20.340\n And the reason I fell in love with this idea is I just realized in translating from Russian\n\n44:20.340 --> 44:29.300\n to English how deep philosophical, how much deep philosophical thinking is required.\n\n44:29.300 --> 44:31.140\n Just like single sentences.\n\n44:31.140 --> 44:35.380\n They spent like weeks debating single sentences.\n\n44:35.380 --> 44:40.220\n So and all of that is part of a journey to Russia for several reasons.\n\n44:40.220 --> 44:48.140\n But I just, I want to explore something in me that longs to understand and to connect\n\n44:48.140 --> 44:51.780\n with the roots where I come from.\n\n44:51.780 --> 44:59.900\n So maybe can you comment, whether it's on the Russian side or the German side or other\n\n44:59.900 --> 45:06.580\n French side, is there something in your own explorations of these philosophies that you\n\n45:06.580 --> 45:11.660\n find that you miss because you don't deeply know the language?\n\n45:11.660 --> 45:14.580\n Or like how important is it to understand the language?\n\n45:14.580 --> 45:15.580\n Good.\n\n45:15.580 --> 45:19.900\n I think it's super important and I'm always embarrassed that I don't know more languages\n\n45:19.900 --> 45:23.860\n and don't know the languages I know as well as I would like to.\n\n45:23.860 --> 45:26.060\n But there's a way in.\n\n45:26.060 --> 45:30.980\n So I do think different languages allow you to think in different ways and that there's\n\n45:30.980 --> 45:38.060\n a sort of a mode of existence, a way of being that's captured by a language that it makes\n\n45:38.060 --> 45:43.280\n certain ways of thinking about yourself or others more natural and it closes off other\n\n45:43.280 --> 45:46.780\n ways of thinking about yourself and others.\n\n45:46.780 --> 45:51.140\n And so I think languages are fascinating in that way.\n\n45:51.140 --> 45:56.540\n The Heidegger who is this philosopher that I'm interested in says at one point, language\n\n45:56.540 --> 45:58.940\n is the house of being.\n\n45:58.940 --> 46:07.860\n And I think that means something like it's by living in a language that you come to understand\n\n46:07.860 --> 46:13.440\n or that possibilities for understanding what it is to be you and others and anything are\n\n46:13.440 --> 46:14.580\n opened up.\n\n46:14.580 --> 46:16.780\n And different languages open up different possibilities.\n\n46:16.780 --> 46:21.340\n And we had that discussion offline about James Joyce, how I took a course in James Joyce\n\n46:21.340 --> 46:27.220\n and how I don't think I understood anything besides the dead and the short stories.\n\n46:27.220 --> 46:33.340\n And you suggested that it might be helpful to actually visit Ireland, visit Dublin to\n\n46:33.340 --> 46:37.500\n truly to help you understand, maybe fall in love with the words.\n\n46:37.500 --> 46:43.900\n And so that presumably is not purely about the understanding of the actual words of the\n\n46:43.900 --> 46:44.900\n language.\n\n46:44.900 --> 46:50.440\n It's understanding something much deeper, the music of the language or something, music\n\n46:50.440 --> 46:52.020\n of the ideas.\n\n46:52.020 --> 46:53.460\n Absolutely.\n\n46:53.460 --> 46:54.460\n Something like that.\n\n46:54.460 --> 46:56.160\n It's very hard to say exactly what that is.\n\n46:56.160 --> 47:02.020\n But when you hear an Irish person who really understands Joyce read some sentences, they\n\n47:02.020 --> 47:06.180\n have a different cadence, they have a different tonality, they have different music to use\n\n47:06.180 --> 47:07.340\n your word.\n\n47:07.340 --> 47:13.580\n And all of a sudden you think about them differently and the sentences sort of draw different thoughts\n\n47:13.580 --> 47:15.600\n out of you when they're read in certain ways.\n\n47:15.600 --> 47:18.080\n That's what great actors can do.\n\n47:18.080 --> 47:22.780\n But I think language is rich like that.\n\n47:22.780 --> 47:29.600\n And the idea which philosophers tend to have that we're really studying the crucial aspects\n\n47:29.600 --> 47:35.280\n of language when we think about its logical form, when we think about the sort of claims\n\n47:35.280 --> 47:39.640\n of philosophical logic that you can make or how do you translate this proposition into\n\n47:39.640 --> 47:44.160\n some symbolic form, I think that's part of what goes on in language.\n\n47:44.160 --> 47:51.700\n But I think that when language affects us in the deep way that it can when great poets\n\n47:51.700 --> 47:58.460\n or great writers or great thinkers use it to great effect, it's way more than that.\n\n47:58.460 --> 48:01.080\n And that's the interesting form of language that I'm interested in.\n\n48:01.080 --> 48:07.620\n It's kind of a challenge I'm hoping to take on is I feel like some of the ideas that are\n\n48:07.620 --> 48:11.480\n conveyed through language are actually can be put outside of language.\n\n48:11.480 --> 48:17.700\n So one of the challenges I have to do is to have a conversation with people in Russian,\n\n48:17.700 --> 48:22.000\n but for an English audience and not rely purely on translators.\n\n48:22.000 --> 48:28.920\n There would of course be translators there that help me dance through this mess of language,\n\n48:28.920 --> 48:36.080\n but also like my goal, my hope is to dance from Russian to English back and forth for\n\n48:36.080 --> 48:39.000\n an English speaking audience and for a Russian speaking audience.\n\n48:39.000 --> 48:44.200\n So not this pure, this is Russian, it's going to be translated to English or this is English,\n\n48:44.200 --> 48:49.400\n it's going to be translated to Russian, but dance back and forth and try to share with\n\n48:49.400 --> 48:54.720\n people who don't speak one of the languages, the music that they're missing and sort of\n\n48:54.720 --> 48:59.480\n almost hear that music as if you're sitting in another room and you hear the music through\n\n48:59.480 --> 49:00.480\n the wall.\n\n49:00.480 --> 49:01.640\n I get a sense of it.\n\n49:01.640 --> 49:08.260\n I think that would be a waste if I don't try to pursue this being a bilingual human being.\n\n49:08.260 --> 49:14.800\n And I wonder whether it's possible to capture some of the magic of the ideas in a way that\n\n49:14.800 --> 49:18.920\n can be conveyed to people who don't speak that particular language.\n\n49:18.920 --> 49:20.920\n I think it's a super exciting project.\n\n49:20.920 --> 49:23.240\n I look forward to following it.\n\n49:23.240 --> 49:25.680\n I'll tell you one thing that does happen.\n\n49:25.680 --> 49:28.280\n So we read Dostoevsky in translation.\n\n49:28.280 --> 49:32.120\n Occasionally I do have Russian speakers in the room, which is super helpful, but I also\n\n49:32.120 --> 49:39.460\n encourage my students to, some of them will have different translations than others.\n\n49:39.460 --> 49:45.880\n And that can be really helpful for the non native speaker because by paying attention\n\n49:45.880 --> 49:52.520\n to the places where translators diverge in their translations of a given word or a phrase\n\n49:52.520 --> 49:57.480\n or something like that, you can start to get the idea that somehow the words that we have\n\n49:57.480 --> 50:02.760\n in English, they don't have the same contours as the word in Russian that's being translated.\n\n50:02.760 --> 50:07.360\n And then you can start to ask about what those differences are.\n\n50:07.360 --> 50:11.240\n And I think there's a kind of magic to it.\n\n50:11.240 --> 50:18.020\n I mean, it's astonishing how rich and affecting these languages can be for people who grew\n\n50:18.020 --> 50:20.480\n up in them, especially who speak them as native speakers.\n\n50:20.480 --> 50:26.160\n And that's a really powerful thing that actually doesn't exist enough of is, for example, for\n\n50:26.160 --> 50:33.840\n Dostoevsky, most novels have been translated by two or three famous translators.\n\n50:33.840 --> 50:37.560\n And there's a lot of discussion about who did it better and so on.\n\n50:37.560 --> 50:43.360\n But I would love to, I'm a computer science person, I would love to do a diff where you\n\n50:43.360 --> 50:48.080\n automatically detect all the differences in the translation just as you're saying and\n\n50:48.080 --> 50:55.840\n use that, like somebody needs to publish literally just books describing the differences.\n\n50:55.840 --> 50:57.960\n In fact, I'll probably do a little bit of this.\n\n50:57.960 --> 51:04.120\n I heard the individual translators in interviews and in blog posts and articles discuss particular\n\n51:04.120 --> 51:09.040\n phrases that they differ on, but like to do that for an entire book, that's a fascinating\n\n51:09.040 --> 51:15.440\n exploration as an English speaker, just to read the differences in the translations.\n\n51:15.440 --> 51:23.760\n You probably can get some deep understanding of ideas in those books by seeing the struggle\n\n51:23.760 --> 51:26.360\n of the translators to capture that idea.\n\n51:26.360 --> 51:28.240\n That's a really interesting idea.\n\n51:28.240 --> 51:29.240\n Absolutely.\n\n51:29.240 --> 51:32.480\n And you can do that for other projects and other languages too.\n\n51:32.480 --> 51:38.320\n I mean, one of the, I don't know, I have this weird, huge range of interests and some days\n\n51:38.320 --> 51:40.960\n I'll find myself reading about something.\n\n51:40.960 --> 51:46.080\n At one point I was interested in 14th century German mysticism.\n\n51:46.080 --> 51:47.080\n Okay.\n\n51:47.080 --> 51:50.760\n Turns out there's somebody who's written like volumes and volumes about this.\n\n51:50.760 --> 51:51.880\n He's fantastic.\n\n51:51.880 --> 51:55.480\n And I was interested in reading Meister Eckhart.\n\n51:55.480 --> 51:58.640\n I wanted to know what was interesting about him.\n\n51:58.640 --> 52:04.520\n And the sort of move that this guy Bernard McGinn, who's the great scholar of this period\n\n52:04.520 --> 52:11.880\n made, was to say what Eckhart did, and everybody knows this, he translated Christianity into\n\n52:11.880 --> 52:12.880\n the vernacular.\n\n52:12.880 --> 52:17.080\n He started giving sermons in German to the peasants, sermons used to be in Latin and\n\n52:17.080 --> 52:18.080\n nobody could speak Latin.\n\n52:18.080 --> 52:22.460\n Can you imagine sitting there for a two hour sermon in a language that you don't know?\n\n52:22.460 --> 52:27.920\n So he translated it into German, but in doing it, the resources of the German language are\n\n52:27.920 --> 52:30.340\n different from the resources of the Latin language.\n\n52:30.340 --> 52:38.280\n Then there's a word in middle high German, Grund, which we translated as ground.\n\n52:38.280 --> 52:41.640\n And it's got this earthy feel to it.\n\n52:41.640 --> 52:46.800\n It sort of invokes the notion of soil and what you stand on and what things grow out\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:52.960\n of and sort of what you could run your fingers through that would have a kind of honesty\n\n52:52.960 --> 52:54.700\n to it.\n\n52:54.700 --> 52:57.240\n And there's no Latin word for that.\n\n52:57.240 --> 53:02.640\n But in Eckhart's interpretation of Christianity, Grund, that's like the fundamental thing.\n\n53:02.640 --> 53:07.280\n You don't understand God until you understand the way in which he is our ground.\n\n53:07.280 --> 53:14.240\n And all of a sudden, this mysticism gets a kind of German cant that makes sense to the\n\n53:14.240 --> 53:21.400\n people who speak German and that reveals something totally different about what you could think\n\n53:21.400 --> 53:25.640\n that form of existence was that was covered over by the fact that it had always been done\n\n53:25.640 --> 53:27.800\n in Latin.\n\n53:27.800 --> 53:29.600\n Yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n53:29.600 --> 53:36.380\n So we talked about Dostoevsky and the use of murder to explore human nature.\n\n53:36.380 --> 53:42.280\n Let's go to Camus, who is maybe less concerned with murder, more concerned with suicide as\n\n53:42.280 --> 53:44.220\n a way to explore human nature.\n\n53:44.220 --> 53:52.840\n So he is probably my favorite existentialist, probably one of the more accessible existentialists.\n\n53:52.840 --> 53:58.740\n And like you said, one of the people who didn't like to call himself an existentialist.\n\n53:58.740 --> 54:01.120\n So what are your thoughts about Camus?\n\n54:01.120 --> 54:03.960\n What role does he play in the story of existentialism?\n\n54:03.960 --> 54:06.360\n So I find Camus totally fascinating.\n\n54:06.360 --> 54:07.360\n I really do.\n\n54:07.360 --> 54:14.200\n And for years, I didn't teach Camus because the famous thing that you're referring to,\n\n54:14.200 --> 54:19.960\n The Myth of Sisyphus, which is a sort of essay, it's published as a book, super accessible,\n\n54:19.960 --> 54:20.960\n really fascinating.\n\n54:20.960 --> 54:23.960\n He's a great writer, really engaging.\n\n54:23.960 --> 54:30.840\n The opening line is something like, there is but one truly significant philosophical\n\n54:30.840 --> 54:34.120\n question, and that is the question of suicide.\n\n54:34.120 --> 54:39.840\n And I thought, I can't teach my 18 year olds.\n\n54:39.840 --> 54:41.800\n I just thought that's terrible.\n\n54:41.800 --> 54:42.800\n How can I...\n\n54:42.800 --> 54:47.880\n I mean, it's not wrong, but do I want to bring that into the classroom?\n\n54:47.880 --> 54:54.900\n And so I read it, I read the essay, I avoided it for a long time just because of that line.\n\n54:54.900 --> 54:58.320\n And I thought, I'm not going to be able to make sense of this in a way that will be helpful\n\n54:58.320 --> 54:59.320\n for anyone.\n\n54:59.320 --> 55:03.760\n But finally, one year, maybe seven or eight years ago, I sat down to read it.\n\n55:03.760 --> 55:07.000\n I thought, I've got to really confront it.\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:10.160\n And I read it and it's incredibly engaging.\n\n55:10.160 --> 55:12.900\n I mean, it's really, really beautiful.\n\n55:12.900 --> 55:17.360\n And Camus was against suicide, which just turns out to be good.\n\n55:17.360 --> 55:24.720\n I was happy about that, but he has a bit of a bleak understanding of what human existence\n\n55:24.720 --> 55:26.320\n amounts to.\n\n55:26.320 --> 55:32.560\n And so in the end, he thinks that human existence is absurd.\n\n55:32.560 --> 55:36.720\n And absurd is a kind of technical term for him.\n\n55:36.720 --> 55:45.720\n And it means that the episodes in your life and your life as a whole presents itself to\n\n55:45.720 --> 55:51.320\n you as if it's got a meaning, but really it doesn't.\n\n55:51.320 --> 55:59.760\n So there's this tension between the way things seem to be on their surface and what really\n\n55:59.760 --> 56:03.560\n turns out to be true about them.\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:05.560\n And he gives these great examples.\n\n56:05.560 --> 56:06.760\n You probably remember these.\n\n56:06.760 --> 56:13.120\n He says, there you are, you're walking along the street and there's a plate glass window\n\n56:13.120 --> 56:18.400\n in a building and through the window you see somebody talking on a telephone.\n\n56:18.400 --> 56:24.620\n I mean, I imagined it as a cell phone, but Camus didn't, but you see somebody talking\n\n56:24.620 --> 56:26.720\n on a cell phone and he's animated.\n\n56:26.720 --> 56:31.840\n He's talking a lot as if things really meant something.\n\n56:31.840 --> 56:36.660\n And yet Camus says, it's a dumb show.\n\n56:36.660 --> 56:39.360\n And it's not dumb just in the sense that it's stupid.\n\n56:39.360 --> 56:41.880\n It's dumb in the sense that it's silent.\n\n56:41.880 --> 56:46.640\n It presents itself as if it's got some significance and yet its significance is withheld from\n\n56:46.640 --> 56:47.640\n you.\n\n56:47.640 --> 56:50.120\n And he says, that's what our lives are like.\n\n56:50.120 --> 56:54.120\n Everything in our lives presents themselves to us as if it's got a significance, but it\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:56.880\n doesn't, it's absurd.\n\n56:56.880 --> 57:01.960\n And then he says, really what our lives are like, they're like the lives of Sisyphus.\n\n57:01.960 --> 57:07.440\n Just day after day, you do the same thing.\n\n57:07.440 --> 57:11.960\n You wake up at a certain time, you get on the bus, you go to work, you take your lunch\n\n57:11.960 --> 57:13.760\n break, you get off.\n\n57:13.760 --> 57:19.440\n I have a colleague who once said to me something like this, it was about October or so in the\n\n57:19.440 --> 57:20.440\n fall semester.\n\n57:20.440 --> 57:22.680\n I said, how's it going, Dick?\n\n57:22.680 --> 57:24.000\n He said, well, you know how it is.\n\n57:24.000 --> 57:29.960\n I got on the conveyor belt at the beginning of the semester and I'm just going through\n\n57:29.960 --> 57:32.140\n and that's the way my life is.\n\n57:32.140 --> 57:38.920\n And Camus thinks that experience, which you can sometimes have, reveals something true\n\n57:38.920 --> 57:41.320\n about what human lives are like.\n\n57:41.320 --> 57:46.400\n Our lives really just are like the life of Sisyphus who rolls this boulder up the hill\n\n57:46.400 --> 57:48.200\n from morning till night.\n\n57:48.200 --> 57:53.080\n And then at night he gets to the top and it rolls back down to the bottom.\n\n57:53.080 --> 57:57.560\n Over the course of the night, he walks back down and then he starts it all over again.\n\n57:57.560 --> 58:03.680\n And he says, Sisyphus is condemned to this life like we're condemned to our lives.\n\n58:03.680 --> 58:10.440\n But we do have one bit of freedom and it's the only thing that we can hang on to.\n\n58:10.440 --> 58:18.100\n It's the freedom to stick it to the gods who put us in this position by embracing this\n\n58:18.100 --> 58:21.400\n existence rather than giving up and committing suicide.\n\n58:21.400 --> 58:26.720\n And I thought, well, it's kind of a happy ending.\n\n58:26.720 --> 58:33.240\n But I also thought it's a dim view of what our existence amounts to.\n\n58:33.240 --> 58:37.480\n So I think there's something fascinating about that.\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:42.500\n But what I came to believe, and I tried to write about this once, I know you read the\n\n58:42.500 --> 58:47.960\n thing about aliveness that I published once, that's secretly a criticism of Camus.\n\n58:47.960 --> 58:50.400\n I don't think I mentioned Camus in there.\n\n58:50.400 --> 58:56.520\n But I think Camus has got the phenomenon wrong or he's missed some important aspect of it.\n\n58:56.520 --> 59:02.360\n Because in Camus view, when you experience your day as sort of going on in this deadening\n\n59:02.360 --> 59:07.500\n way and you're just doing the things that you always do the way you always do them,\n\n59:07.500 --> 59:11.280\n for Camus, that reveals the truth about what our lives are.\n\n59:11.280 --> 59:16.700\n But I think there's some aspect, at least for me, and maybe he just didn't feel this\n\n59:16.700 --> 59:20.400\n or didn't have access to it, maybe others don't.\n\n59:20.400 --> 59:25.200\n But for me, there's an extra part to it, which is somehow that, yes, that's the way\n\n59:25.200 --> 59:30.520\n things are and it's inadequate.\n\n59:30.520 --> 59:36.440\n And there's something that's missing from that aspect of our existence that could be\n\n59:36.440 --> 59:38.060\n there.\n\n59:38.060 --> 59:43.120\n And it feels like our lives are not about just putting up with that and sticking it\n\n59:43.120 --> 59:50.840\n to the gods by embracing it, but seeking that absence part of it, the part that's recognizable\n\n59:50.840 --> 59:54.660\n in its absence in your experience of that.\n\n59:54.660 --> 59:56.700\n And that's what I think.\n\n59:56.700 --> 1:00:04.400\n I think we do have the experience of the presence of that in moments when you feel truly alive.\n\n1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:08.960\n And that's what you mean by the word aliveness, which is a fascinating and a powerful word.\n\n1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:10.640\n Yeah, that's what I mean by it.\n\n1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:17.560\n I think most people can recognize moments in their lives when they really felt alive.\n\n1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:23.600\n And it could happen in a moment when, I don't know, maybe Miles Davis felt it in that moment\n\n1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:29.160\n when he was responding to Herbie Hancock's chord, or maybe you feel it in that moment\n\n1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:34.940\n where you grab for the hand on the first date and the gesture is reciprocated, or maybe\n\n1:00:34.940 --> 1:00:41.880\n you feel it in some moment when you are doing a kind of peak athletic thing or watching\n\n1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:45.520\n somebody else do a peak athletic thing.\n\n1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:52.560\n But I think there are moments when it feels like it's not like the way Camus is describing\n\n1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:54.240\n things.\n\n1:00:54.240 --> 1:00:56.480\n And it's better because of that.\n\n1:00:56.480 --> 1:01:04.220\n So I think one really powerful way for me to understand aliveness is to think about\n\n1:01:04.220 --> 1:01:07.320\n going to a darker territory, is to think about suicide.\n\n1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:12.880\n And I've known people in my life who suffer from clinical depression.\n\n1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:21.320\n And whatever the chemistry is in our brain, there is a certain kind of feeling that is\n\n1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:30.180\n to be depressed, where you look in the mirror and ask, do I want to kill myself today?\n\n1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:36.880\n This is the question that Camus asks, this question, this philosophical question.\n\n1:01:36.880 --> 1:01:44.960\n And there is people who, when they're depressed, say, not only do they say, I want to kill\n\n1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:49.360\n myself or I don't, they say, it doesn't matter.\n\n1:01:49.360 --> 1:01:54.720\n And that's chemistry, that's whatever that is, that's chemistry in our mind.\n\n1:01:54.720 --> 1:01:59.600\n And then on the flip side of that, for me, I've had some low points, but I've been very\n\n1:01:59.600 --> 1:02:03.920\n fortunate to not suffer from that kind of depression.\n\n1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:11.600\n I am the opposite, which is not only moments of peak performance in athletics or great\n\n1:02:11.600 --> 1:02:19.180\n music or any of that, I'm just deeply joyful often by mundane things.\n\n1:02:19.180 --> 1:02:22.960\n As you were saying it, I was drinking this thing and it's cold, and for some reason the\n\n1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:27.920\n coldness of that was like, oh, great, like refrigeration.\n\n1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:28.920\n I don't know.\n\n1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:32.840\n There was a joy in that, like, I can't put it into words, but it just felt great.\n\n1:02:32.840 --> 1:02:37.960\n And then just so many things, you look out in nature, there's a nice breeze and just\n\n1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:40.160\n like, it's amazing.\n\n1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:46.540\n So that doesn't feel like I'm embracing the absurd.\n\n1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:51.760\n That seems like I'm getting some nice like dopamine hits in whatever the chemistry is\n\n1:02:51.760 --> 1:02:56.000\n from just the basics of life, and that is the source of aliveness.\n\n1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:05.560\n However my brain is built, it's gotten a natural sort of mechanism for aliveness.\n\n1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:12.000\n And so one nice way to see the absence of aliveness is to look at the chemical, the\n\n1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.260\n clinical depression.\n\n1:03:14.260 --> 1:03:19.240\n And so that Camus doesn't seem to contend with that at all in asking the question of\n\n1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:23.760\n suicide because when you look in the mirror and ask, like, if I ask myself, do I want\n\n1:03:23.760 --> 1:03:28.040\n to kill myself today, I ask that question in a different way, more like a stoic way\n\n1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:33.280\n often, like basically every day is, you know, what if I die today?\n\n1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:37.280\n It's more like contemplating your mortality every single day.\n\n1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:44.880\n You know, that excites me, the possibility that this is my last day, that, you know,\n\n1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:47.160\n it just reminds me how amazing life is.\n\n1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:53.640\n And that's chemistry, I don't know what that is, but that's not, that's certainly not some\n\n1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:57.080\n kind of philosophical decision I made.\n\n1:03:57.080 --> 1:04:04.320\n I am a little bit riding a wave of the chemistry of the genetics I've been given, of the dopamine.\n\n1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:10.760\n So that question of suicide, by the way, do you find that formulation of the question\n\n1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:17.600\n of existentialism, I know you didn't want to teach it because obviously suicide is a\n\n1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:22.440\n very difficult word, especially for young minds, but do you think that's a useful formulation\n\n1:04:22.440 --> 1:04:25.400\n of the question of existentialism?\n\n1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:29.840\n Like him saying, this is the most important question of suicide.\n\n1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:35.240\n I think there is something to it, if you read the question as the question, what is it in\n\n1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:43.400\n virtue of which it ought to be desirable to live the lives that we're capable of living?\n\n1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:44.400\n That's a deep question.\n\n1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:49.880\n Yeah, that's a question that gets focused when someone asks themselves whether they\n\n1:04:49.880 --> 1:04:53.760\n ought to continue to live that life.\n\n1:04:53.760 --> 1:05:01.120\n The famous line, nothing focuses the mind more than one's impending execution.\n\n1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:06.880\n I think there's something important about that, that recognizing the riskiness and the\n\n1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:13.800\n vulnerability of one's existence is super important.\n\n1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:20.820\n And I think that if we didn't have that, our lives wouldn't be capable of being meaningful.\n\n1:05:20.820 --> 1:05:25.300\n If they weren't risky and vulnerable, there would be nothing to lose.\n\n1:05:25.300 --> 1:05:28.320\n And it's only because there are things to lose that they can come to have the significance\n\n1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:29.320\n that they do.\n\n1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:34.320\n So yeah, I think I'm not against the idea that that's a deep way of approaching the\n\n1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:38.120\n questions at the core of existentialism.\n\n1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:42.880\n But as you said, I was worried for a while about how I was going to teach it.\n\n1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:48.560\n Well, I think there's a difference between suicide and not living because suicide is\n\n1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:50.600\n an action.\n\n1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:58.800\n So it feels like to me, like suicide doesn't make sense because, you know, imagine you're\n\n1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:04.920\n in like a hotel and you're saying the room I'm in sucks, but like there's other rooms.\n\n1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:08.180\n So like maybe explore those other rooms.\n\n1:06:08.180 --> 1:06:15.320\n Maybe you'll find meaning in those other rooms, like basically embracing the fact that you\n\n1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:20.420\n don't know everything and there's a, you need time to explore everything.\n\n1:06:20.420 --> 1:06:25.680\n It's like once you've explored everything, then maybe you can make a full decision.\n\n1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:30.680\n But it's unfair to make a decision.\n\n1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:35.720\n It's I would say unethical to make a decision until you've explored all the rooms in the\n\n1:06:35.720 --> 1:06:36.720\n hotel.\n\n1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:37.720\n Yeah.\n\n1:06:37.720 --> 1:06:40.600\n And this gets focused in the brothers Karamazov, of course.\n\n1:06:40.600 --> 1:06:47.520\n There's one brother who is really asking that question, is asking the question of suicide.\n\n1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:53.220\n He's asking the question whether the world that we live in is a world that's worth living\n\n1:06:53.220 --> 1:06:54.820\n in.\n\n1:06:54.820 --> 1:06:59.720\n And I think that character is, as you say, very ill.\n\n1:06:59.720 --> 1:07:08.480\n And it's possible and often because, as you say, of, you know, brain chemistry, physiology,\n\n1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:15.500\n there's certainly a physical ground to that situation, to that condition.\n\n1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:20.400\n But I think it is possible for someone to be in that situation.\n\n1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:28.560\n I think that Ivan Karamazov, who's the character who's asking this question, is, you know,\n\n1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:31.160\n maybe let's say chemically depressed or something like that.\n\n1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:33.600\n But I think there's more to it too.\n\n1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:39.160\n And I think that Dostoevsky's real view is that the brain chemistry doesn't exist on\n\n1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:40.160\n its own.\n\n1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:45.440\n Like the way we interact with one another, the way we care about or isolate ourselves\n\n1:07:45.440 --> 1:07:54.520\n from others, the way we care for the lives that we lead, affects the chemistry of our\n\n1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:57.520\n brain, which goes on and changes the mood that we're in.\n\n1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:06.800\n So I think Dostoevsky does think that Ivan's salvation, if he's capable of being saved,\n\n1:08:06.800 --> 1:08:09.200\n is gonna come through the love of his brother Alyosha.\n\n1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:13.200\n Let me spring maybe a bit of a tangent on you.\n\n1:08:13.200 --> 1:08:17.640\n Do you ever, one of my other favorite authors is Herman Hesse.\n\n1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:24.640\n Do you ever include him in our deck of sport cards that represent existentialism?\n\n1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:25.640\n I haven't.\n\n1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:26.640\n Maybe I should.\n\n1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:27.640\n What should I read?\n\n1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:28.640\n What should I think about including?\n\n1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:35.040\n Oh no, there's some kind of embrace of absurdism.\n\n1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:42.680\n Like there's a existentialist kind of ideal pervading most of his work.\n\n1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:49.840\n But there's more of a, like with Siddhartha, there's more almost like a Buddhist sort of\n\n1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:53.880\n like watch the river and like become the river.\n\n1:08:53.880 --> 1:08:59.800\n Like this kind of idea that what it means to truly experience the moment.\n\n1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:05.560\n So there is an experiential part of existentialism where you want to, it's not just about, we've\n\n1:09:05.560 --> 1:09:10.360\n been talking about kind of decisions and actions, but also what it means to listen, like you\n\n1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:15.960\n said from Nietzsche, like what it means to really take in the world and experience the\n\n1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:16.960\n moment.\n\n1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:20.960\n So he's very good at writing about what it means to experience the moment and experience\n\n1:09:20.960 --> 1:09:23.280\n the full absurdity of the moment.\n\n1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:30.360\n And for him, I'm starting to forget, Steppenwolf, I think, is humor.\n\n1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:35.880\n It's part of the absurdity, which I think modern day internet explores very well with\n\n1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.920\n memes and so on.\n\n1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:45.600\n Humor is a fundamental part of the existentialist ethic that's able to deal with absurdity.\n\n1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.160\n You got to like laugh at it.\n\n1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:52.080\n I think there is some, let me just say something about humor because I think you're absolutely\n\n1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:53.080\n right.\n\n1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:59.520\n Richard Bard, who is Danish and most people think deeply depressed and so on, is actually\n\n1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:02.400\n an incredibly funny writer.\n\n1:10:02.400 --> 1:10:07.320\n And someone who was a classmate of mine in graduate school who left philosophy to become\n\n1:10:07.320 --> 1:10:11.080\n a Hollywood comedy writer, he's a very successful guy.\n\n1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:15.880\n And then he came back 25 years later and finished his dissertation.\n\n1:10:15.880 --> 1:10:21.480\n And I was the reader on the dissertation, there may be a conflict of interest, I'm not\n\n1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:22.480\n quite sure.\n\n1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:27.400\n But his dissertation was about, he called it Kierkegaard and the Funny, which is a kind\n\n1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:29.040\n of a funny title, yeah.\n\n1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:36.200\n But Kierkegaard, according to Eric Kaplan's reading, Kierkegaard does have this idea that\n\n1:10:36.200 --> 1:10:47.240\n there's something destabilizing about humor that's crucial to the important possibilities\n\n1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:48.240\n for us.\n\n1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:55.200\n And so there's the idea that there's a moment when a joke is being set up, when you're sort\n\n1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:02.380\n of proceeding as if you're on stable ground, and then the punchline comes and the rug is\n\n1:11:02.380 --> 1:11:04.000\n pulled out from under you.\n\n1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:08.680\n And for a moment, it's like you're falling.\n\n1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:15.240\n There's nothing supporting you until you're captured by your totally new understanding\n\n1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:22.840\n of what was going on, and that humor necessarily has that kind of destabilizing feature to\n\n1:11:22.840 --> 1:11:23.840\n it.\n\n1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.740\n And that's like the riskiness, that's like the riskiness that you were pointing to.\n\n1:11:28.740 --> 1:11:33.760\n If there aren't risks in your life, if your life is totally safe, then there's no possibility\n\n1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:35.320\n of significance.\n\n1:11:35.320 --> 1:11:41.440\n And so I think on Eric's reading, Kierkegaard sort of wants to line up the importance of\n\n1:11:41.440 --> 1:11:47.440\n the riskiness and vulnerability in your life to its having meaning with the experience\n\n1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:55.280\n of destabilization that you get in jokes and comedy, which then becomes significant, right?\n\n1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:59.360\n When you remember having heard a joke for the first time, it's got a kind of salience\n\n1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:00.360\n for you.\n\n1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:07.520\n Speaking of jokes, and speaking of, you mentioned film and literature, so existentialism in\n\n1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:08.880\n film and literature.\n\n1:12:08.880 --> 1:12:18.120\n I think for a lot of people, especially nihilism, was experienced in the great modern work of\n\n1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:19.120\n art called Big Lebowski.\n\n1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:26.160\n I don't know if you've ever seen that film, but there's a group of nihilists in that film.\n\n1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:27.920\n They're just like, they don't care about anything.\n\n1:12:27.920 --> 1:12:31.400\n I think they happen to be German, at least they have German accents.\n\n1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:40.360\n So maybe can you talk about notable appearances of existentialism in film, and if you at all\n\n1:12:40.360 --> 1:12:45.240\n ever bring up Big Lebowski, if that ever comes into play?\n\n1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:49.840\n So I know that people think about the Big Lebowski in this context, and I did actually\n\n1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:51.840\n rewatch it not so long ago.\n\n1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:54.160\n We have kids, and I thought, maybe it's time.\n\n1:12:54.160 --> 1:13:00.320\n It wasn't really time for the 11 year old, so somewhat inappropriate.\n\n1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:02.960\n I have never taught that film, so I'd have to think more.\n\n1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:03.960\n We could talk about it.\n\n1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:06.520\n I'd be happy to try to think on the fly about it.\n\n1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:11.760\n Okay, so I would love to, because there is a, feels like there's a philosophical depth\n\n1:13:11.760 --> 1:13:12.760\n to that film.\n\n1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:17.920\n So there's a person that just, the main character.\n\n1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:18.920\n The Jeff Bridges character.\n\n1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:20.480\n Jeff Bridges character, yeah.\n\n1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:26.360\n He kind of, he drinks like these white Russians, and he just kind of walks around in a very\n\n1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:37.080\n relaxed way, and irradiates both a love for life, but also just an acceptance of like,\n\n1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:41.200\n it is what it is kind of philosophy.\n\n1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:49.080\n And then there's a bunch of characters that have very busy lives trying to do some big\n\n1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:54.420\n projects that are dramatic in some way, make some huge amounts of money.\n\n1:13:54.420 --> 1:13:58.900\n So it kind of actually reminds me of The Idiot by Dostoevsky in a certain kind of sense.\n\n1:13:58.900 --> 1:14:05.160\n And then there's these players, I mean, they're phrased as nihilists, but they kind of don't\n\n1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:07.140\n care to enjoy life.\n\n1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:09.440\n They want to mess with life in some kind of way.\n\n1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:18.540\n And of course there's interesting personalities that, what is it, Jesus, the bowler.\n\n1:14:18.540 --> 1:14:26.640\n And then there's like Donnie, who is a bit clueless, and then there's the John Goodman\n\n1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:32.320\n character that's talking about Vietnam and just takes life way too seriously, too intensely\n\n1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:33.320\n and so on.\n\n1:14:33.320 --> 1:14:38.480\n So it just paints a full sort of spectrum of characters that are operating in this world.\n\n1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:45.320\n And perhaps most importantly for existentialism are thrown into absurdity and hence the humor.\n\n1:14:45.320 --> 1:14:46.320\n Okay.\n\n1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:47.320\n All right, good.\n\n1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.320\n Well, that's helpful.\n\n1:14:48.320 --> 1:14:49.320\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:50.320\n Reminding me of all that.\n\n1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:51.320\n And I think...\n\n1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:55.840\n So one thing to say is that the nihilists, the group of nihilists who call themselves\n\n1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:03.620\n nihilists, I think they've got a bad misinterpretation of what nihilism is supposed to be.\n\n1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:07.500\n And this happened actually in the 20s.\n\n1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:14.520\n There was a famous case of a couple of German students, Leopold and Loeb, who'd read a lot\n\n1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:23.500\n of Nietzsche, Nietzsche was a kind of hero for the Nazis even, I think based on a pretty\n\n1:15:23.500 --> 1:15:26.340\n bad misunderstanding of what he was up to.\n\n1:15:26.340 --> 1:15:31.660\n But Leopold and Loeb had the bad understanding first and they were students, they'd read\n\n1:15:31.660 --> 1:15:35.140\n a lot of Nietzsche and they thought, okay, nothing means anything.\n\n1:15:35.140 --> 1:15:42.240\n The only way that there's any significance in life is through our will to sort of powerfully\n\n1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.460\n bring something about.\n\n1:15:44.460 --> 1:15:50.940\n And if we're gonna do that in a way that reflects the fact that nothing means anything, then\n\n1:15:50.940 --> 1:15:58.140\n what we should do is take these things, these actions that people always thought were bad\n\n1:15:58.140 --> 1:16:02.780\n and do them and show that there's nothing wrong with doing them.\n\n1:16:02.780 --> 1:16:05.800\n And so they decided they would murder someone.\n\n1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:08.900\n Not because they were angry at them, just someone they'd never met.\n\n1:16:08.900 --> 1:16:10.940\n It was important that it was someone they'd never met.\n\n1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:13.460\n It was totally unmotivated act.\n\n1:16:13.460 --> 1:16:20.640\n And they thought, we'll embrace nihilism by showing that we can act in such a way as to\n\n1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:27.920\n do something that morality thinks is bad and through our will bring it about that we desire\n\n1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:32.820\n to do it for no reason that has anything to do with its potentially being interpretable\n\n1:16:32.820 --> 1:16:34.720\n as good.\n\n1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:40.500\n And I think that's a terrible misreading of what Nietzsche thinks the response to nihilism\n\n1:16:40.500 --> 1:16:41.500\n is.\n\n1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:44.260\n I mean, I think, read that against the Miles Davis thing.\n\n1:16:44.260 --> 1:16:51.300\n Miles Davis aim is to creatively bring it about that something works well in a situation\n\n1:16:51.300 --> 1:16:53.020\n where he is kind of constrained.\n\n1:16:53.020 --> 1:16:58.340\n So they thought two things, one, there are no constraints at all, not even the constraints\n\n1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:00.380\n of the situation that we find ourselves in.\n\n1:17:00.380 --> 1:17:08.400\n And two, we only become the beings that we really are when we act against what you might\n\n1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.500\n have thought the constraints were.\n\n1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:14.100\n And I just think that's a bad misreading of what that kind of nihilism is up to.\n\n1:17:14.100 --> 1:17:20.460\n And I think maybe that group in the Big Lebowski has got that kind of bad misreading.\n\n1:17:20.460 --> 1:17:23.400\n But then the major characters are much more interesting.\n\n1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:24.680\n Go ahead and say something.\n\n1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:29.020\n So there's some kind of apathy to that particular nihilism.\n\n1:17:29.020 --> 1:17:37.220\n Could you comment on whether you see sort of apathy as a philosophy part of that nihilism?\n\n1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:45.500\n Sort of like from an existentialist perspective, how important is it to care about stuff?\n\n1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:48.940\n Like really take on life?\n\n1:17:48.940 --> 1:17:56.460\n What does existentialism have to say about just sitting back and just not caring?\n\n1:17:56.460 --> 1:17:57.460\n Excellent.\n\n1:17:57.460 --> 1:18:01.900\n So apathy is like a really important word.\n\n1:18:01.900 --> 1:18:05.340\n The Greek word is apathe, it means without passions.\n\n1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:10.780\n And the Stoics, who you mentioned earlier, really thought that passions are what get\n\n1:18:10.780 --> 1:18:14.300\n in the way if you're living well.\n\n1:18:14.300 --> 1:18:18.420\n Because to live well, you have to think clearly about what you should do and you shouldn't\n\n1:18:18.420 --> 1:18:24.660\n let your resentments and your angers and your petty animosities direct your behavior.\n\n1:18:24.660 --> 1:18:28.620\n You should release yourself from those kinds of passions.\n\n1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:37.340\n So Stoicism, again, huge caricature, but it's an aim not to care because caring is bad.\n\n1:18:37.340 --> 1:18:44.780\n And there's certain forms of existentialism, certainly in Pascal and Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky\n\n1:18:44.780 --> 1:18:49.560\n and Heidegger and Sartre in his own way.\n\n1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:53.580\n So it's not just a theistic or atheistic thing.\n\n1:18:53.580 --> 1:18:57.540\n What's crucial about us is that we do care.\n\n1:18:57.540 --> 1:19:02.400\n Heidegger says, care is the being of Dasein, Dasein is his name for us.\n\n1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:06.780\n What it is to be us is to be the being that already cares.\n\n1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:09.060\n And you can't not do that.\n\n1:19:09.060 --> 1:19:13.460\n You can pretend you're not doing it, but you're just caring in a different way.\n\n1:19:13.460 --> 1:19:18.900\n It's like Sartre saying, you can pretend you're not taking responsibility.\n\n1:19:18.900 --> 1:19:23.500\n You can pretend that you don't have to make a decision, that is making a decision.\n\n1:19:23.500 --> 1:19:25.740\n Not caring is a way of caring.\n\n1:19:25.740 --> 1:19:31.420\n And so I think the existentialists that I'm interested in think that we do care.\n\n1:19:31.420 --> 1:19:34.820\n That's constitutive of what it is to be us.\n\n1:19:34.820 --> 1:19:37.820\n And so they'll think that the Stoics got it wrong.\n\n1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:49.840\n But that leaves open a huge range of moves about how we inhabit that existence well.\n\n1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:53.620\n Let me ask about Ayn Rand.\n\n1:19:53.620 --> 1:20:01.820\n So it just so happens that she's entered a few conversations in this podcast, and just\n\n1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:07.540\n looking at academic philosophy or just philosophers in general, they seem to ignore Ayn Rand.\n\n1:20:07.540 --> 1:20:10.060\n Do you have a sense of why that is?\n\n1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:20.620\n Did she ever come into play her ideas of objectivism, come into play of discussions of a good life\n\n1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:26.780\n from the perspective of existentialism in how you teach it and how you think about it?\n\n1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:30.980\n Is she somebody who you find at all interesting?\n\n1:20:30.980 --> 1:20:36.420\n So no, I don't think she is, but it's been a long time since I've read her stuff.\n\n1:20:36.420 --> 1:20:37.660\n I read it in high school.\n\n1:20:37.660 --> 1:20:41.660\n I read The Fountainhead in high school and Atlas Shrugged, but that's at this point a\n\n1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:42.660\n very long time ago.\n\n1:20:42.660 --> 1:20:46.900\n I think I read something about objective epistemology or something too.\n\n1:20:46.900 --> 1:20:53.900\n So my view about her could be based on a total misunderstanding of what she's up to.\n\n1:20:53.900 --> 1:21:02.180\n But sort of my caricature of her and tell me if I've got it wrong is that she's sort\n\n1:21:02.180 --> 1:21:11.300\n of motivated by a kind of, I think maybe sometimes you call it libertarianism, but maybe let's\n\n1:21:11.300 --> 1:21:17.580\n in the context of our discussion tie it back to Sartre, a kind of view according to which\n\n1:21:17.580 --> 1:21:21.980\n we're the being who has to contend with the fact that we're radically free to do stuff\n\n1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:27.300\n and we're just not being courageous or brave enough when we don't do that.\n\n1:21:27.300 --> 1:21:33.100\n And the people to admire are the people who make stuff out of nothing.\n\n1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:34.740\n So maybe that's a bad caricature.\n\n1:21:34.740 --> 1:21:35.740\n No, no, no.\n\n1:21:35.740 --> 1:21:38.140\n I think, no, I think that's pretty accurate.\n\n1:21:38.140 --> 1:21:43.860\n I'm not again, very knowledgeable about the full depth of her philosophy, but I think\n\n1:21:43.860 --> 1:21:53.700\n she takes a view of the world that's similar to Sartre in the conclusions, but makes stronger\n\n1:21:53.700 --> 1:22:00.180\n statements about epistemology that first of all, everything is knowable and there's some,\n\n1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:03.180\n you should always operate through reason.\n\n1:22:03.180 --> 1:22:05.620\n Like reason is very important.\n\n1:22:05.620 --> 1:22:13.420\n Like it's like you start with a few axioms and you build on top of that and the axioms\n\n1:22:13.420 --> 1:22:16.860\n that everybody should operate on are the same.\n\n1:22:16.860 --> 1:22:21.660\n Again, reality is objective, it's not subjective.\n\n1:22:21.660 --> 1:22:27.300\n So from that you can derive the entirety of how humans should behave at the individual\n\n1:22:27.300 --> 1:22:30.060\n level and at the societal level.\n\n1:22:30.060 --> 1:22:35.380\n And there's a few conclusions, she would talk about virtue of selfishness and sort of a\n\n1:22:35.380 --> 1:22:39.020\n lot of people use that to dismiss her, look, she's very selfish and so on.\n\n1:22:39.020 --> 1:22:44.060\n She actually meant something very different is like, it's more like the Sartre thing,\n\n1:22:44.060 --> 1:22:51.620\n take responsibility for yourself, understand what forces you're operating under and make\n\n1:22:51.620 --> 1:22:52.980\n the best of this life.\n\n1:22:52.980 --> 1:22:58.740\n And that's how you can be the best member of societies by making the best life you can\n\n1:22:58.740 --> 1:23:03.760\n and just focusing yourself, like fix your own problems first and then that will make\n\n1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:10.700\n you the best member of society, of your family, of loved ones, of friends and so on.\n\n1:23:10.700 --> 1:23:16.580\n I think the reason she's disliked, obviously on the philosophy side, she's disliked because\n\n1:23:16.580 --> 1:23:22.020\n a little bit like Nietzsche, she's literary.\n\n1:23:22.020 --> 1:23:28.540\n I think the reason she's publicly disliked in sort of public conversations is because\n\n1:23:28.540 --> 1:23:33.700\n of how sure she is of herself, which is some of the philosophers have been known to do\n\n1:23:33.700 --> 1:23:39.020\n like make very strong statements like hell is other people, but she was making very strong\n\n1:23:39.020 --> 1:23:42.900\n statements about basically everything.\n\n1:23:42.900 --> 1:23:52.980\n But the reason I bring her up is she is an influential thinker that is not for some reason\n\n1:23:52.980 --> 1:23:57.300\n often brought up as such, it's not acknowledged how influential she is.\n\n1:23:57.300 --> 1:24:05.380\n I was recently looking at like a list of the most important women of the 20th century in\n\n1:24:05.380 --> 1:24:12.020\n terms of thought, not science, but like thought and she wasn't in that list.\n\n1:24:12.020 --> 1:24:18.640\n And I see this time and time again and it doesn't make sense to me why she's so kind\n\n1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:26.260\n of dismissed because clearly she's an author of some of the most read books like ever and\n\n1:24:26.260 --> 1:24:34.420\n she clearly had very strong ideas that she'd be contented with.\n\n1:24:34.420 --> 1:24:39.580\n That's why it kind of didn't make sense to me because she's also a creature of her time\n\n1:24:39.580 --> 1:24:44.940\n and an important one, she's a creation of the Soviet Union, somebody who left because\n\n1:24:44.940 --> 1:24:50.540\n of that and so some of the strength of her ideas has to do with how much she dislikes\n\n1:24:50.540 --> 1:24:56.340\n that particular philosophy and way of life.\n\n1:24:56.340 --> 1:25:02.300\n But also she's a creature of Sartre and that whole Nietzsche and so on.\n\n1:25:02.300 --> 1:25:07.980\n Now one of the other criticisms is she doesn't integrate herself into this history.\n\n1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:14.540\n She keeps basically kind of implying that she's purely original in all her thoughts\n\n1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:18.200\n even though she's kind of citing a lot of other people.\n\n1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:23.860\n But again, many philosophers do this kind of thing as if they are truly original and\n\n1:25:23.860 --> 1:25:24.860\n they're not.\n\n1:25:24.860 --> 1:25:29.220\n It is interesting and also what's interesting about her is she is a woman, she is a strong\n\n1:25:29.220 --> 1:25:38.940\n feminist and it feels like with Simone de Beauvoir, it seems like she's a very important\n\n1:25:38.940 --> 1:25:42.620\n person in this moment of history that shouldn't be fully forgotten.\n\n1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:43.620\n Interesting.\n\n1:25:43.620 --> 1:25:44.620\n Yeah.\n\n1:25:44.620 --> 1:25:46.940\n Well, so I mean I don't have a lot to add.\n\n1:25:46.940 --> 1:25:54.220\n I will just say this, I mean the way she and Beauvoir seem to me from your description\n\n1:25:54.220 --> 1:26:00.500\n of her and remembering what I remember from 35 years ago, they seem pretty opposite from\n\n1:26:00.500 --> 1:26:02.460\n one another.\n\n1:26:02.460 --> 1:26:08.000\n One of the things I find interesting about Beauvoir is that she takes seriously the thing\n\n1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:16.940\n that Sartre didn't, which is our throwness, which is the sense in which we're born into\n\n1:26:16.940 --> 1:26:21.340\n a situation that's already got a significance.\n\n1:26:21.340 --> 1:26:26.540\n I think it was easier for her to recognize that than Sartre because she was a woman.\n\n1:26:26.540 --> 1:26:32.420\n And Sartre seems to act as if there are no constraints or at least there shouldn't be.\n\n1:26:32.420 --> 1:26:38.340\n We're pretty close as privileged white males and if we could just get rid of the last bits\n\n1:26:38.340 --> 1:26:41.860\n of them, we would be God like we're supposed to be.\n\n1:26:41.860 --> 1:26:44.940\n And I think Beauvoir sort of sees things differently.\n\n1:26:44.940 --> 1:26:50.140\n I think she recognizes one's not born but becomes a woman, she says.\n\n1:26:50.140 --> 1:26:51.580\n So how does that happen?\n\n1:26:51.580 --> 1:26:56.220\n Well you're thrown into your culture and your culture starts treating you in a certain way\n\n1:26:56.220 --> 1:27:00.380\n because of your gender and that starts to form your understanding and your experience\n\n1:27:00.380 --> 1:27:01.380\n of things.\n\n1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:07.780\n By the time you're grown up, well you're pretty well formed by that.\n\n1:27:07.780 --> 1:27:08.780\n That seems a fact.\n\n1:27:08.780 --> 1:27:14.580\n It's a fact about Sartre too though, it was harder for him to notice it because he was\n\n1:27:14.580 --> 1:27:17.580\n formed into his privilege.\n\n1:27:17.580 --> 1:27:22.060\n But the world reminds us of our throwness for some more than others.\n\n1:27:22.060 --> 1:27:23.540\n Yes, absolutely.\n\n1:27:23.540 --> 1:27:31.660\n And for people who have to contend on a daily basis with the fact that the social position\n\n1:27:31.660 --> 1:27:39.180\n they're thrown into is one that negates them or one that oppresses them or one that sort\n\n1:27:39.180 --> 1:27:44.660\n of pushes them to the side in some way or another, I mean the black experience is interesting\n\n1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:46.300\n in this respect too.\n\n1:27:46.300 --> 1:27:51.820\n Frantz Fanon who's a contemporary of Sartre and Beauvoir writes about it and it's very\n\n1:27:51.820 --> 1:27:57.580\n familiar the things that he's saying now but he writes back in the 50s about being a black\n\n1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:07.260\n man in Paris and getting on an elevator with a woman alone and how her reaction to him,\n\n1:28:07.260 --> 1:28:12.980\n not knowing him, not having any views about any reason to have any views about him sort\n\n1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:17.260\n of puts him in a particular social position with respect to her.\n\n1:28:17.260 --> 1:28:25.340\n And if you don't have that experience, it's much harder to recognize the way in which\n\n1:28:25.340 --> 1:28:29.340\n what we're thrown into is something we might not have chosen.\n\n1:28:29.340 --> 1:28:37.740\n So the idea that that's not an aspect of our existence, which as you describe Ayn Rand's\n\n1:28:37.740 --> 1:28:44.340\n views, she sounds more like Sartre, she sounds more like either it's not an aspect of our\n\n1:28:44.340 --> 1:28:47.820\n existence or at least we ought to sort of aim at it's not being an aspect of our existence.\n\n1:28:47.820 --> 1:28:49.540\n Yeah, almost act as if it's not.\n\n1:28:49.540 --> 1:28:50.540\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:51.540\n Act as if it's not.\n\n1:28:51.540 --> 1:28:57.020\n And so I think from my point of view, I don't pretend that I'm explaining the public reception\n\n1:28:57.020 --> 1:29:03.860\n of her, I'm just sort of trying to say how I understand her in this intellectual context.\n\n1:29:03.860 --> 1:29:09.980\n From my point of view, that's something big to miss and the ambition to think that really\n\n1:29:09.980 --> 1:29:13.780\n what's happening is that we're all the same, we're all rational beings.\n\n1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:19.100\n We're all beings who if we just got the axioms of our existence right and made good judgments\n\n1:29:19.100 --> 1:29:25.580\n and reasoned in an appropriate way, would optimize ourselves.\n\n1:29:25.580 --> 1:29:33.500\n That feels to me like a kind of natural end point of the philosophical tradition.\n\n1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:38.500\n I mean, sort of Plato starts off with a view that helps us in that direction and the enlightenment\n\n1:29:38.500 --> 1:29:41.100\n moves us further in that direction.\n\n1:29:41.100 --> 1:29:47.320\n But from my point of view, that movement has led us astray because it's missed something\n\n1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:52.420\n really important that's crucial to the kind of being that we are.\n\n1:29:52.420 --> 1:29:55.180\n Yeah, it misses the music.\n\n1:29:55.180 --> 1:29:58.020\n Exactly, it misses the music.\n\n1:29:58.020 --> 1:30:02.260\n Let's talk about thrownness and I think you mentioned that in the context of Heidegger.\n\n1:30:02.260 --> 1:30:03.260\n Yeah.\n\n1:30:03.260 --> 1:30:04.900\n So can we talk about Heidegger?\n\n1:30:04.900 --> 1:30:05.900\n Okay.\n\n1:30:05.900 --> 1:30:08.160\n Who is this philosopher?\n\n1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:12.180\n What are some fascinating ideas that he brought to the world?\n\n1:30:12.180 --> 1:30:13.180\n Okay.\n\n1:30:13.180 --> 1:30:15.900\n So Martin Heidegger was a German philosopher.\n\n1:30:15.900 --> 1:30:20.540\n I do know when he was born, 1889, but I know that only by accident.\n\n1:30:20.540 --> 1:30:24.620\n It's because it's the same year that Wittgenstein, an Austrian philosopher, was born and the\n\n1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:26.280\n same year that Hitler was born.\n\n1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:31.680\n So if I've remembered my dates right and someone will call in and correct me otherwise.\n\n1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:35.220\n But that's the way it sort of sits in my memory bank.\n\n1:30:35.220 --> 1:30:39.460\n And it's interesting that the three of them were born at the same time.\n\n1:30:39.460 --> 1:30:46.980\n Wittgenstein and Heidegger share some similarities, but then it's also interesting that Heidegger\n\n1:30:46.980 --> 1:30:47.980\n was a Nazi.\n\n1:30:47.980 --> 1:30:53.380\n I mean, this is a very disturbing fact about his personal political background.\n\n1:30:53.380 --> 1:30:57.900\n And so it's something that anyone who thinks that things that he said might be interesting\n\n1:30:57.900 --> 1:30:59.900\n has got to contend with.\n\n1:30:59.900 --> 1:31:04.260\n Heidegger was born in Germany, Hitler in Austria.\n\n1:31:04.260 --> 1:31:06.860\n Wittgenstein is Austria also.\n\n1:31:06.860 --> 1:31:12.180\n But so you have to, when you call Heidegger a Nazi, you have to remember, I mean, there\n\n1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:14.100\n was millions of Nazis too.\n\n1:31:14.100 --> 1:31:19.500\n So like there are parts of their, that's the history of the world.\n\n1:31:19.500 --> 1:31:26.740\n There's a lot of communists, Marxists and Nazis in that part of history.\n\n1:31:26.740 --> 1:31:27.740\n Absolutely.\n\n1:31:27.740 --> 1:31:32.980\n And one of the discussion points is, well, was he just a kind of social Nazi?\n\n1:31:32.980 --> 1:31:38.500\n I mean, you know, he went to parties with them and stuff, or was he like, did he really\n\n1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:40.220\n believe in the ideology?\n\n1:31:40.220 --> 1:31:42.540\n And that's a choice point.\n\n1:31:42.540 --> 1:31:44.900\n And we could talk about it if you want.\n\n1:31:44.900 --> 1:31:46.820\n He held a political position.\n\n1:31:46.820 --> 1:31:48.780\n That's one of the relevant parts.\n\n1:31:48.780 --> 1:31:52.820\n In 1933, he was made rector of the University of Freiburg.\n\n1:31:52.820 --> 1:31:56.020\n That's like the president of the university.\n\n1:31:56.020 --> 1:32:00.980\n And that was in Germany, all the universities are state universities.\n\n1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:03.320\n And so that's a political appointment.\n\n1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:06.380\n Can we just pause on this point?\n\n1:32:06.380 --> 1:32:13.620\n From an existentialist perspective, what's the role for standing up to evil?\n\n1:32:13.620 --> 1:32:19.900\n So I mean, I think Camus probably had something to say about these things because he was a\n\n1:32:19.900 --> 1:32:21.700\n bit of a political figure.\n\n1:32:21.700 --> 1:32:28.260\n Like do you have a responsibility, not just for your decisions, but you know, if the world\n\n1:32:28.260 --> 1:32:38.740\n you see around you is going against what you believe somewhere deep inside is ethical,\n\n1:32:38.740 --> 1:32:43.460\n do you have a responsibility to stand up to that, even if it costs you your life or your\n\n1:32:43.460 --> 1:32:44.460\n wellbeing?\n\n1:32:44.460 --> 1:32:49.540\n Well, you ask from an existential perspective and there's lots of different positions that\n\n1:32:49.540 --> 1:32:50.540\n you could have.\n\n1:32:50.540 --> 1:32:53.900\n So let me tell you something in the area of what I think I might believe, which comes\n\n1:32:53.900 --> 1:32:57.620\n out of this tradition.\n\n1:32:57.620 --> 1:33:05.780\n And it's this, if you live in a community where people are being dragged down by the\n\n1:33:05.780 --> 1:33:13.900\n norms of the community rather than elevated, then there's two things that you have to recognize.\n\n1:33:13.900 --> 1:33:17.520\n One is that you bear some responsibility for that.\n\n1:33:17.520 --> 1:33:23.060\n Not necessarily because you chose it, maybe you reviled it, maybe you were against it.\n\n1:33:23.060 --> 1:33:29.660\n But there's some way in which we all act in accordance with the norms of our culture.\n\n1:33:29.660 --> 1:33:31.860\n We all give in to them in some way or another.\n\n1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:37.260\n And if those norms are broken, then there's some way in which we've allowed ourselves\n\n1:33:37.260 --> 1:33:41.020\n to be responsible for broken norms.\n\n1:33:41.020 --> 1:33:42.960\n We've become responsible for broken norms.\n\n1:33:42.960 --> 1:33:45.400\n And I do think you have to face up to that.\n\n1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:49.060\n I think that, let's just take gender norms.\n\n1:33:49.060 --> 1:33:51.340\n Maybe the gender norms are broken.\n\n1:33:51.340 --> 1:33:57.780\n Maybe the way men and women treat one another or the way men treat women is broken.\n\n1:33:57.780 --> 1:33:59.780\n Maybe it is.\n\n1:33:59.780 --> 1:34:03.900\n I'm not making a substantive claim, I'm just saying lots of people say it is.\n\n1:34:03.900 --> 1:34:13.460\n And if you're in a culture where those norms take roots, you don't get to just isolate\n\n1:34:13.460 --> 1:34:19.700\n yourself and pull yourself out of the culture and think, I don't have any responsibility.\n\n1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:21.660\n You're already a part of the culture.\n\n1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:28.540\n Even if you're isolating yourself from it, that's a way of rejecting the sort of part\n\n1:34:28.540 --> 1:34:32.940\n you play in the culture, but it's not a way of getting behind it.\n\n1:34:32.940 --> 1:34:35.220\n Now you're playing that role differently.\n\n1:34:35.220 --> 1:34:41.240\n You're saying, I don't want to take responsibility for what's going on around me.\n\n1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.820\n And that's a way of taking responsibility by refusing to do it.\n\n1:34:45.820 --> 1:34:50.540\n I think we're implicated in whatever's going on around us.\n\n1:34:50.540 --> 1:34:57.740\n And if we're going to do anything in our lives, we ought to recognize that, recognize that\n\n1:34:57.740 --> 1:35:03.660\n even in situations where you maybe didn't decide to do it, you could be part of bringing\n\n1:35:03.660 --> 1:35:09.300\n other people down and then devote yourself to trying to figure out how to act differently\n\n1:35:09.300 --> 1:35:12.580\n so that the norms update themselves.\n\n1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:16.100\n And I think this is not a criticism of people.\n\n1:35:16.100 --> 1:35:20.740\n Alyosha, who we mentioned in The Brothers Karamazov, he's a character, he's a kind of\n\n1:35:20.740 --> 1:35:24.620\n saintly character in The Brothers Karamazov.\n\n1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:33.220\n But that one crucial moment in that story is when he realizes how awful he's been being\n\n1:35:33.220 --> 1:35:36.980\n to someone without ever even intending to do that.\n\n1:35:36.980 --> 1:35:43.220\n It's Grushenka, who's this sort of fascinating woman, and she's a very erotic woman.\n\n1:35:43.220 --> 1:35:45.540\n She's sort of sexual.\n\n1:35:45.540 --> 1:35:51.660\n And Alyosha, in my reading of it, is kind of attracted to her.\n\n1:35:51.660 --> 1:35:56.700\n But he's a young kid, he's 20 or whatever, and he's kind of embarrassed about it.\n\n1:35:56.700 --> 1:36:00.500\n And he lives in the monastery and he's thinking maybe he wants to be a priest and he's kind\n\n1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:01.540\n of embarrassed by it.\n\n1:36:01.540 --> 1:36:02.920\n So what does he do?\n\n1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:08.940\n Every time they run across one another in the street, he averts his gaze.\n\n1:36:08.940 --> 1:36:10.220\n And why is he doing that?\n\n1:36:10.220 --> 1:36:12.640\n Because he's kind of embarrassed.\n\n1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:14.340\n But how does Grushenka experience it?\n\n1:36:14.340 --> 1:36:18.940\n Well, she knows she's a fallen woman and she knows that Alyosha has this other position\n\n1:36:18.940 --> 1:36:20.460\n in society.\n\n1:36:20.460 --> 1:36:24.260\n So her read on it is, he's passing judgment on me.\n\n1:36:24.260 --> 1:36:27.600\n He can see that he doesn't want to be associated with me.\n\n1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:29.420\n He can see that I'm a fallen woman.\n\n1:36:29.420 --> 1:36:34.980\n He knows that in order to maintain his purity, he's got to avoid me.\n\n1:36:34.980 --> 1:36:39.540\n That's not what Alyosha intended to do, but that's the way it's experienced.\n\n1:36:39.540 --> 1:36:45.100\n And so there's this way he comes to recognize, oh my God, what I'm supposed to do is love\n\n1:36:45.100 --> 1:36:48.460\n people in Dostoevsky's view of things.\n\n1:36:48.460 --> 1:36:51.580\n And what I'm doing instead is dragging this poor woman down.\n\n1:36:51.580 --> 1:36:53.100\n I'm making her life worse.\n\n1:36:53.100 --> 1:36:55.460\n I'm making her feel terrible about herself.\n\n1:36:55.460 --> 1:36:59.940\n And if I actually came to know her, I'd recognize her condition is difficult.\n\n1:36:59.940 --> 1:37:01.600\n She's living a difficult life.\n\n1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:03.140\n She's making hard choices.\n\n1:37:03.140 --> 1:37:09.100\n And why don't I see that in her face instead of this other thing that's making me want\n\n1:37:09.100 --> 1:37:10.100\n to avoid her?\n\n1:37:10.100 --> 1:37:11.100\n And that's a huge moment.\n\n1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:15.780\n So, but the idea is that we're implicated in bringing other people down, whether we\n\n1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:19.620\n want to be or not, and that's our condition.\n\n1:37:19.620 --> 1:37:26.060\n The requirement to understand that is to be almost to a radical degree, be empathetic\n\n1:37:26.060 --> 1:37:30.860\n and to listen to the world.\n\n1:37:30.860 --> 1:37:33.900\n And I mean, you brought up sort of gender roles.\n\n1:37:33.900 --> 1:37:35.580\n It's not so simple.\n\n1:37:35.580 --> 1:37:37.020\n All of this is messy.\n\n1:37:37.020 --> 1:37:39.740\n For example, this is me talking.\n\n1:37:39.740 --> 1:37:47.860\n It's clear to me that, for example, the woke culture has bullying built into it, has some\n\n1:37:47.860 --> 1:37:51.340\n elements of the same kind of evil built into it.\n\n1:37:51.340 --> 1:37:56.900\n And when you're part of the wave of wokeness standing up for social rights, you also have\n\n1:37:56.900 --> 1:38:00.860\n to listen and think, are we going too far?\n\n1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:02.420\n Are we hurting people?\n\n1:38:02.420 --> 1:38:09.020\n Are we doing the same things that others that we're fighting against, that others were doing\n\n1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:10.020\n in the past?\n\n1:38:10.020 --> 1:38:19.100\n So it's not simple once you see that there's evil being done that is easy to fix.\n\n1:38:19.100 --> 1:38:30.020\n No, in our society, there's something about our human nature that just too easily stops\n\n1:38:30.020 --> 1:38:33.900\n listening to the world, to empathizing with the world.\n\n1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:35.640\n And we label things as evil.\n\n1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:37.300\n This is through human history.\n\n1:38:37.300 --> 1:38:38.300\n This is evil.\n\n1:38:38.300 --> 1:38:40.100\n You mentioned tribes.\n\n1:38:40.100 --> 1:38:42.020\n This religious belief is evil.\n\n1:38:42.020 --> 1:38:45.540\n And so we have to fight it and we become certain and dogmatic about it.\n\n1:38:45.540 --> 1:38:49.000\n And then in so doing, commit evil onto the world.\n\n1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:59.060\n It seems like a life that accepts and responsibility for the norms we're in has to constantly be\n\n1:38:59.060 --> 1:39:05.820\n sort of questioning yourself and questioning, like listening to the world fully and richly\n\n1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:13.580\n without being weighed down by any one sort of realization.\n\n1:39:13.580 --> 1:39:16.180\n You just always constantly have to be thinking about the world.\n\n1:39:16.180 --> 1:39:17.180\n Am I wrong?\n\n1:39:17.180 --> 1:39:18.740\n Am I wrong in seeing the world this way?\n\n1:39:18.740 --> 1:39:23.740\n I mean, the very last thing you said, you've constantly got to be thinking about the world.\n\n1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:25.280\n You've constantly got to be listening.\n\n1:39:25.280 --> 1:39:26.880\n You've constantly got to be attending.\n\n1:39:26.880 --> 1:39:28.780\n And it's not simple.\n\n1:39:28.780 --> 1:39:30.620\n All that sounds exactly right to me.\n\n1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:34.940\n The phrase that rings through my head is another one from the Brothers Karamazov.\n\n1:39:34.940 --> 1:39:44.140\n Demetri, this passionate sort of sometimes violent brother who is also sort of deeply\n\n1:39:44.140 --> 1:39:45.140\n cares.\n\n1:39:45.140 --> 1:39:49.500\n I mean, because he's passionate, he's sort of got care through and through, but it's\n\n1:39:49.500 --> 1:39:51.240\n breaking him apart.\n\n1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:57.740\n He says at one point, God and the devil are fighting and the battlefield is the heart\n\n1:39:57.740 --> 1:39:58.740\n of man.\n\n1:39:58.740 --> 1:40:02.640\n And I just think, yeah, it's not simple.\n\n1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:08.380\n And the idea that there might be a purely good way of doing things is just not our condition.\n\n1:40:08.380 --> 1:40:13.000\n That everything we do is going to be sort of undermined by some aspect of it.\n\n1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:18.180\n There's not going to be a kind of pure good in human existence.\n\n1:40:18.180 --> 1:40:25.300\n And so it's sort of required that we're going to have to be empathetic, that we're going\n\n1:40:25.300 --> 1:40:32.260\n to have to recognize that others are dealing with that just as we are.\n\n1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:33.820\n So I apologize for distracting us.\n\n1:40:33.820 --> 1:40:40.220\n We were talking about Heidegger and the reason we were distracted is he happened to also\n\n1:40:40.220 --> 1:40:45.260\n be a Nazi, but he nevertheless has a lot of powerful ideas.\n\n1:40:45.260 --> 1:40:47.420\n What are the ideas he's brought to the world?\n\n1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:48.420\n Okay.\n\n1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:49.820\n So that's a big, huge question.\n\n1:40:49.820 --> 1:40:54.260\n So let me see how much of it I can get on the table.\n\n1:40:54.260 --> 1:40:59.980\n I mean, the big picture is that Heidegger thinks, and he's not really wrong to think\n\n1:40:59.980 --> 1:41:07.220\n this, that the whole history of philosophy from Plato forward, maybe even from the pre\n\n1:41:07.220 --> 1:41:17.880\n Socratics forward, from like the sixth century BC to now has been grounded on a certain kind\n\n1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:25.180\n of assumption that it didn't have the right to make and that it's led us astray.\n\n1:41:25.180 --> 1:41:30.560\n And that until we understand the way in which it's led us astray, we're not going to be\n\n1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:34.340\n able to get to grips with the condition we now find ourselves in.\n\n1:41:34.340 --> 1:41:39.100\n So let me start with what he thinks the condition we now find ourselves in is.\n\n1:41:39.100 --> 1:41:42.140\n Lots of periods to Heidegger's views.\n\n1:41:42.140 --> 1:41:46.180\n I'm just going to sort of mush it all together for the purposes of today.\n\n1:41:46.180 --> 1:41:52.180\n Heidegger thinks that one of the crucial things that we need to contend with when we think\n\n1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:59.620\n about what it is to be us now is that the right name for our age is a technological\n\n1:41:59.620 --> 1:42:00.620\n age.\n\n1:42:00.620 --> 1:42:04.300\n And what does it mean for our age to be a technological age?\n\n1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:11.900\n Well, it means that we have an understanding of what it is for anything at all to be at\n\n1:42:11.900 --> 1:42:19.660\n all that we never really chose, that sort of animating the way we live our lives, that's\n\n1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:26.560\n animating our understanding of ourselves and everything else that is quite limited.\n\n1:42:26.560 --> 1:42:35.900\n And it's organized around the idea that to be something is to be what's sitting there\n\n1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:45.640\n as an infinitely flexible reserve to be optimized and made efficient.\n\n1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:57.580\n And Heidegger thinks that's not just the way we think of silicon circuits or the river\n\n1:42:57.580 --> 1:43:02.600\n when we put a hydroelectric power plant on it, we're optimizing the flow of the river\n\n1:43:02.600 --> 1:43:07.740\n so that it makes energy which is infinitely flexible and we can use in any way at all.\n\n1:43:07.740 --> 1:43:11.180\n It's the way we understand ourselves too.\n\n1:43:11.180 --> 1:43:19.420\n We think of ourselves as this reserve of potential that needs to be made efficient and optimized.\n\n1:43:19.420 --> 1:43:28.140\n And when I talk with my students about it, I ask them, what's your calendar look like?\n\n1:43:28.140 --> 1:43:30.060\n What's the goal of your day?\n\n1:43:30.060 --> 1:43:32.940\n Is it to get as many things into it as possible?\n\n1:43:32.940 --> 1:43:41.340\n Is it to feel like I've failed unless I've made my life so efficient that I'm doing this\n\n1:43:41.340 --> 1:43:45.780\n and this and this and this and this that I can't let things go by?\n\n1:43:45.780 --> 1:43:52.940\n The feeling that I think we all have that there's some pressure to do that, to relate\n\n1:43:52.940 --> 1:44:00.420\n to ourselves that way is a clue to what Heidegger thinks the technological age is about.\n\n1:44:00.420 --> 1:44:04.980\n And he thinks that's different from every other age in history.\n\n1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:09.960\n We used to think of ourselves in the 17th century at the beginning of the Enlightenment\n\n1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:17.900\n as subjects who represent objects, Descartes thought that a subject is something, some\n\n1:44:17.900 --> 1:44:23.620\n mental sort of realm that represents the world in a certain way.\n\n1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:30.220\n And we are closed in on ourselves in the sense that we have a special relation to our representations\n\n1:44:30.220 --> 1:44:32.980\n and that's what the realm of the subject is.\n\n1:44:32.980 --> 1:44:37.540\n But others, in the Middle Ages, we were created in the image and likeness of God.\n\n1:44:37.540 --> 1:44:44.540\n In the pre Socratic age, to be was to be what whooshes up and lingers for a while and fades\n\n1:44:44.540 --> 1:44:45.540\n away.\n\n1:44:45.540 --> 1:44:52.780\n The paradigm of what is were thunderstorms and the anger of the gods, Achilles battle\n\n1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:59.900\n fury and it overtakes everything and stays for a while and then leaves, the flowers blooming\n\n1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:00.980\n in spring.\n\n1:45:00.980 --> 1:45:04.760\n And that's very different from the way we experience ourselves.\n\n1:45:04.760 --> 1:45:09.780\n And so the question is, what are we supposed to do in the face of that?\n\n1:45:09.780 --> 1:45:17.820\n And Heidegger thinks that the presupposition that's motivated everything from the pre Socratics\n\n1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:28.160\n forward is that there is some entity that's the ground of the way we understand everything\n\n1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:31.460\n to be. For the Middle Ages, it was God.\n\n1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:35.620\n That was the entity that made things be the things that they are.\n\n1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:38.240\n For the Enlightenment, it was us.\n\n1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:40.800\n Maybe for Sartre, it's us.\n\n1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:47.060\n And Heidegger thinks whatever it is that stands at the ground of what we are, it's not another\n\n1:45:47.060 --> 1:45:48.060\n thing.\n\n1:45:48.060 --> 1:45:49.060\n It's not another entity.\n\n1:45:49.060 --> 1:45:54.820\n And we're relating to it in the wrong way if we think of it like that.\n\n1:45:54.820 --> 1:45:58.020\n This is partly why I was interested in Meister Eckhart.\n\n1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:06.980\n He says, what there is is there's giving going on in the world, and we're the grateful recipient\n\n1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:08.180\n of it.\n\n1:46:08.180 --> 1:46:13.040\n And the giving is like whatever it is, it's the social norms that we're thrown into.\n\n1:46:13.040 --> 1:46:14.040\n We didn't choose them.\n\n1:46:14.040 --> 1:46:15.040\n They were given to us.\n\n1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:16.540\n And that's the ground.\n\n1:46:16.540 --> 1:46:20.280\n That is what makes it possible for anything to be intelligible at all.\n\n1:46:20.280 --> 1:46:24.740\n If we lived outside of communities, if we lived in a world where there were no social\n\n1:46:24.740 --> 1:46:28.240\n norms at all, nothing would mean anything.\n\n1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:29.920\n Nothing would have any significance.\n\n1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:34.640\n Nothing would be regular in the way that things need to be regular in order for there to be\n\n1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:39.600\n departures or manifestations of that regularity.\n\n1:46:39.600 --> 1:46:46.800\n So community norms are crucial, but they're also always updating.\n\n1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:52.220\n We have some responsibility for what they are and the way in which they're updating\n\n1:46:52.220 --> 1:46:53.980\n themselves.\n\n1:46:53.980 --> 1:46:57.320\n And yet we didn't ever choose it to be that way.\n\n1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:05.880\n So those norms are somehow giving significance to us in a way that we're implicated in,\n\n1:47:05.880 --> 1:47:11.200\n we have some relation to, and all that gets covered over if you think of us as efficient\n\n1:47:11.200 --> 1:47:13.200\n resources to be optimized.\n\n1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:18.960\n Is that a conflicting view that we are resources to be optimized?\n\n1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:23.960\n Is that somehow deeply conflicting with the fact that there's a ground that we stand on?\n\n1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:24.960\n Absolutely.\n\n1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:30.760\n So what Heidegger thinks is that this is, he calls this the supreme danger of the technological\n\n1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:36.040\n age is that without ever having chosen it, without ever having decided it, this is the\n\n1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:39.160\n way we understand what it is to be us.\n\n1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:46.680\n But he thinks that it's also, he says, quoting Holderlin, this 18th century German poet,\n\n1:47:46.680 --> 1:47:51.240\n he says, in the supreme danger lies the saving possibility.\n\n1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:52.940\n So what does that mean?\n\n1:47:52.940 --> 1:47:58.280\n It means that this is the understanding that we've been thrown into, that we've been given.\n\n1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:00.560\n It's the gift that was given to us.\n\n1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:01.800\n It's supremely dangerous.\n\n1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:06.720\n If we let ourselves live that way, we'll destroy ourselves.\n\n1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:14.520\n But it's also the saving possibility because if we recognize that we never chose that,\n\n1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:20.360\n that it was given to us, but also we were implicated in its being given and we could\n\n1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:26.240\n find a way to supersede it, that it's the ground, but it's also updatable.\n\n1:48:26.240 --> 1:48:30.360\n He calls the ground, the groundless ground.\n\n1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:38.100\n It's not like an entity, which is there, solid, stable, like God, who's eternal and nonchanging.\n\n1:48:38.100 --> 1:48:43.320\n It's always updating itself and we're always involved in its being updated, but we're only\n\n1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:49.400\n involved in it in the right way if we listen, like Miles Davis.\n\n1:48:49.400 --> 1:48:55.480\n So optimization is not a good way to live life.\n\n1:48:55.480 --> 1:49:02.760\n If you thought that it was obviously clear that that was the relevant value, so obviously\n\n1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.400\n clear that it never even occurred to you to ask whether it was right to think that, then\n\n1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:08.400\n you would be in danger.\n\n1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:09.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:49:09.400 --> 1:49:10.400\n Got it.\n\n1:49:10.400 --> 1:49:16.440\n So yeah, there is some in this modern technological age, in the full meaning of the word technology,\n\n1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:23.520\n that's updated to actual modern age with a lot more technology going on.\n\n1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:29.440\n It does feel like colleagues of mine in the tech space actually are somehow drawn to that\n\n1:49:29.440 --> 1:49:35.960\n optimization as if that's going to save us, as if the thing that truly weighs us down\n\n1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:38.760\n is the inefficiencies.\n\n1:49:38.760 --> 1:49:40.080\n Exactly.\n\n1:49:40.080 --> 1:49:45.880\n And I think if you think about other contexts, like what are the moments when, I mean, we're\n\n1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:47.600\n unique in this respect.\n\n1:49:47.600 --> 1:49:51.180\n This period in history is unlike any previous period.\n\n1:49:51.180 --> 1:49:53.040\n Nobody ever felt that way.\n\n1:49:53.040 --> 1:49:58.520\n But think about, but it's also true that no previous period in history was nihilistic.\n\n1:49:58.520 --> 1:50:03.880\n So our condition is tied up, that sort of thing is meant to be a response to the felt\n\n1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:05.880\n lack of a ground.\n\n1:50:05.880 --> 1:50:11.200\n And so no previous epoch in history felt that way.\n\n1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:14.400\n They didn't have our problem.\n\n1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:22.680\n So it was much more natural to them to experience moments in ways that feel unachievable for\n\n1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:26.120\n us, what we were calling moments of aliveness before.\n\n1:50:26.120 --> 1:50:28.640\n Think about the context in which they felt them.\n\n1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:31.840\n They weren't efficient, optimized contexts.\n\n1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:33.780\n Think about the Greeks.\n\n1:50:33.780 --> 1:50:37.540\n If you ever read Homer, it is a bizarre world back there.\n\n1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:45.720\n But one of the things that's bizarre is that they're so unmotivated by efficiency and optimizing\n\n1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:52.240\n that the only thing that seems to run through all of the different Greek cultures is the\n\n1:50:52.240 --> 1:51:02.640\n idea that if some stranger comes by, you better take care of them because Zeus is the god\n\n1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:04.840\n of strangers and Zeus will be angry.\n\n1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:05.840\n That's what they say, right?\n\n1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:07.880\n But how does it manifest itself?\n\n1:51:07.880 --> 1:51:13.920\n Odysseus, he's trying to get home and he gets shipwrecked on an island and he's trying\n\n1:51:13.920 --> 1:51:20.000\n to figure out, he's been at sea for 10 days, he's starving, he's bedraggled and he sees\n\n1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:26.360\n now Sissa, the princess who's beautiful and he's like, boy, I better, I don't know, get\n\n1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:28.160\n some clothes or something.\n\n1:51:28.160 --> 1:51:31.240\n I don't want them to beat me up and kill me.\n\n1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:34.520\n And so she takes him to the palace.\n\n1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:41.040\n They have three days of banquets and festivals before they even ask his name.\n\n1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:43.360\n It's like, here's a stranger.\n\n1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:48.600\n Our job is to celebrate the presence of a stranger because this is where significance\n\n1:51:48.600 --> 1:51:49.880\n lies.\n\n1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:54.720\n Now we don't have to feel that way, but the idea that that's one of the places where significance\n\n1:51:54.720 --> 1:51:59.940\n could lie is pretty strongly at odds with the idea that our salvation is going to come\n\n1:51:59.940 --> 1:52:02.080\n from optimization and efficiency.\n\n1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:08.440\n Maybe something about the way we live our lives will have that integrated into it.\n\n1:52:08.440 --> 1:52:12.160\n But it's at odds with other moments.\n\n1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:16.780\n Let me ask you a question about Hubert Burt Dreyfus.\n\n1:52:16.780 --> 1:52:24.200\n He is a friend, a colleague, a mentor of yours, unfortunately no longer with us.\n\n1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:30.920\n You wrote with him the book titled All Things Shining, Reading the Western Classics to Find\n\n1:52:30.920 --> 1:52:33.360\n Meaning in a Secular Age.\n\n1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:39.980\n First, can you maybe speak about who that man was, what you learned from him?\n\n1:52:39.980 --> 1:52:45.800\n And then we can maybe ask, how do we find through the classics meaning in a secular\n\n1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:46.800\n age?\n\n1:52:46.800 --> 1:52:47.800\n Okay.\n\n1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:58.560\n So, Burt Dreyfus was a very important philosopher of the late 20th, early 21st century.\n\n1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:03.220\n He died in 2017, about a little over four years ago.\n\n1:53:03.220 --> 1:53:04.220\n He was my teacher.\n\n1:53:04.220 --> 1:53:10.880\n I met him in 1989 when I went away to graduate school in Berkeley, that's where he taught.\n\n1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:18.080\n He plays an interesting and important role in the history of philosophy in America because\n\n1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:26.440\n in a period when most philosophers in America and in the English speaking world were not\n\n1:53:26.440 --> 1:53:31.040\n taking seriously 20th century French and German philosophy, he was.\n\n1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:37.120\n And he was really probably the most important English speaking interpreter of Heidegger,\n\n1:53:37.120 --> 1:53:41.360\n the German philosopher that we're talking about, we've been talking about.\n\n1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:47.840\n He was an incredible teacher, a lot of his influence came through his teaching.\n\n1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:59.720\n And one of the amazing things about him as a teacher was his sort of mix of intellectual\n\n1:53:59.720 --> 1:54:05.400\n humility with sort of deep insightful authority.\n\n1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:11.280\n And he would stand up in front of a class of 300 students, he taught huge classes because\n\n1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:18.760\n people love to go see him and I taught for him for many years and say, I've been reading\n\n1:54:18.760 --> 1:54:23.440\n this text for 40 years, but the question you asked is one I've never asked.\n\n1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:26.360\n And it would be true.\n\n1:54:26.360 --> 1:54:32.120\n He would find in what people said, things that were surprising and new to him.\n\n1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:33.760\n And that's humility actually.\n\n1:54:33.760 --> 1:54:34.760\n That is.\n\n1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:36.560\n Listening to the world.\n\n1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:38.340\n Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1:54:38.340 --> 1:54:46.080\n He was always ready to be surprised by something that someone said and there's something astonishing\n\n1:54:46.080 --> 1:54:47.080\n about that.\n\n1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:52.840\n So his influence was, for people who didn't know him through his interpretations of these\n\n1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:55.160\n texts, he wrote about a huge range of stuff.\n\n1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:59.160\n But for people who did know him, it was through his presence, it was through the way he carried\n\n1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:02.400\n himself in his life.\n\n1:55:02.400 --> 1:55:05.680\n And so in any case, that's who he was.\n\n1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:10.520\n I graduated after many years as a graduate student.\n\n1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:14.480\n I didn't start in philosophy, I started in math, math and computer science, actually.\n\n1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:17.920\n And then I did a lot of work in computational neuroscience for a few years.\n\n1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:20.000\n That's a fascinating journey.\n\n1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:26.080\n We'll get to it through our friendly conversation about artificial intelligence, I'm sure.\n\n1:55:26.080 --> 1:55:32.160\n Because you're basically fascinated with the philosophy of mind, of the human mind, but\n\n1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:39.080\n rooted in a curiosity of mind through the, it's artificial, through the engineering of\n\n1:55:39.080 --> 1:55:40.080\n mind.\n\n1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:41.080\n Yeah.\n\n1:55:41.080 --> 1:55:42.080\n Yeah, that's right.\n\n1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:47.680\n So Bert, I mean, the reason I was attracted to him actually is because of his, to begin\n\n1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:52.960\n with, was because of his criticisms of what was called traditional symbolic AI in the\n\n1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:54.560\n 70s and 80s.\n\n1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:58.960\n So I came to Berkeley as a graduate student who'd done a lot of math and a lot of computer\n\n1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:01.760\n science, a lot of computational neuroscience.\n\n1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:07.400\n I noticed that you interview a lot of people in this world.\n\n1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:13.880\n And I had a teacher at Brown as an undergraduate, Jim Anderson, who wrote with Jeff Hinton a\n\n1:56:13.880 --> 1:56:16.600\n big book on neural networks.\n\n1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:24.360\n So I was interested in that, not so interested in traditional AI, like sort of Lisp programming,\n\n1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:31.240\n things that went on in the 80s, because it felt sort of, when you made a system do something,\n\n1:56:31.240 --> 1:56:34.920\n all of a sudden it was an interesting thing to have done.\n\n1:56:34.920 --> 1:56:38.640\n The fact that you'd solved the problem then made it clear that the problem wasn't an interesting\n\n1:56:38.640 --> 1:56:39.640\n one to solve.\n\n1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:40.640\n That's right.\n\n1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:42.360\n And I had that experience.\n\n1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:51.080\n And Bert had criticisms of symbolic AI, what he called good old fashioned AI, GoFi.\n\n1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:57.800\n And I was attracted to those criticisms because it felt to me that there was something lacking\n\n1:56:57.800 --> 1:56:58.800\n in that project.\n\n1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:00.320\n And I didn't know what it was.\n\n1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:03.320\n I just felt its absence.\n\n1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:10.720\n And then I learned that all his arguments came from his reading of this phenomenological\n\n1:57:10.720 --> 1:57:12.560\n and existential tradition.\n\n1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.160\n And so I had to try to figure out what those folks were saying.\n\n1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:18.040\n And it was a long road, let me tell you.\n\n1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:19.480\n It took me a long time.\n\n1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:21.560\n But it was because of Bert that I was able to do that.\n\n1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.900\n So I owe him that huge debt of gratitude.\n\n1:57:23.900 --> 1:57:28.680\n And eventually we went on to write a book together, which was a great experience.\n\n1:57:28.680 --> 1:57:31.840\n And yes, we published All Things Shining in 2011.\n\n1:57:31.840 --> 1:57:37.600\n And that's a book that I definitely would not have had the chutzpah to try to write\n\n1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:43.320\n if it weren't for Bert because it was really about great literature in the history of the\n\n1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:47.780\n West from Homer and Virgil and Dante to Melville.\n\n1:57:47.780 --> 1:57:53.320\n There's a huge chapter on Melville, a big chapter on David Foster Wallace who Bert didn't\n\n1:57:53.320 --> 1:57:56.220\n care about at all, but I was fascinated by.\n\n1:57:56.220 --> 1:58:04.400\n And so learning to think that way while writing that book with him was an amazing experience.\n\n1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:10.260\n So I have to admit, as one of my failings in life, one of many failings is I've never\n\n1:58:10.260 --> 1:58:15.400\n gotten through Moby Dick or any of Melville's works.\n\n1:58:15.400 --> 1:58:21.040\n So maybe can you comment on, before we talk about David Foster Wallace, who I have gotten\n\n1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:28.160\n through, what are some of the sources of meaning in these classics?\n\n1:58:28.160 --> 1:58:29.160\n Good.\n\n1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:33.880\n So Moby Dick, I think, is the other great novel of the 19th century.\n\n1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:38.520\n So the Brothers Karamazov and Moby Dick, and they're diametrically opposed, which is one\n\n1:58:38.520 --> 1:58:40.320\n of the really interesting things.\n\n1:58:40.320 --> 1:58:47.240\n So Dostoyev, the Brothers Karamazov is a kind of existential interpretation of Russian Orthodox\n\n1:58:47.240 --> 1:58:48.600\n Christianity.\n\n1:58:48.600 --> 1:58:52.320\n How do you live that way and find joy in your existence?\n\n1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:55.400\n Moby Dick is not at all about Christianity.\n\n1:58:55.400 --> 1:59:06.600\n It sort of starts with the observation that the form of Christianity that Ishmael is familiar\n\n1:59:06.600 --> 1:59:11.280\n with is broken, it's not gonna work in his living his life.\n\n1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:18.240\n He has to leave it, he has to go to sea in order to find what needs to happen.\n\n1:59:18.240 --> 1:59:23.760\n And Ishmael is the boating captain, the whaling boat captain.\n\n1:59:23.760 --> 1:59:25.960\n So he's not the captain, that's Ahab.\n\n1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:26.960\n Ahab is the captain.\n\n1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:27.960\n Yeah, right.\n\n1:59:27.960 --> 1:59:28.960\n Let me back up.\n\n1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:32.240\n The famous opening line to the book is, call me Ishmael.\n\n1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:35.640\n And Ishmael is the main character in the book.\n\n1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:36.940\n He's a nobody.\n\n1:59:36.940 --> 1:59:37.940\n He's you and me.\n\n1:59:37.940 --> 1:59:39.420\n He's the everyday guy.\n\n1:59:39.420 --> 1:59:41.520\n He's like a nobody on the ship.\n\n1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:44.960\n He's like, not the lowest, but certainly not the highest.\n\n1:59:44.960 --> 1:59:47.420\n He's right in the middle.\n\n1:59:47.420 --> 1:59:52.480\n And he's named Ishmael, which is interesting, because Ishmael is the illegitimate son of\n\n1:59:52.480 --> 1:59:55.440\n Abraham in the Old Testament.\n\n1:59:55.440 --> 2:00:01.120\n He is the, I think if I have it right, again, someone will correct me.\n\n2:00:01.120 --> 2:00:08.880\n I think he's the one that Islam traces its genesis to.\n\n2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:15.520\n And so Islam is an Abrahamic religion like Judaism and Christianity, but Judaism and\n\n2:00:15.520 --> 2:00:22.000\n Christianity trace their lineage through Isaac, the quote, unquote, legitimate son of Abraham.\n\n2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:28.200\n And Ishmael is the other son of Abraham, who he had with a girlfriend.\n\n2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:33.000\n And so he's clearly outside of Christianity in some way.\n\n2:00:33.000 --> 2:00:39.460\n He's named after the non Christian sort of son of Abraham.\n\n2:00:39.460 --> 2:00:46.600\n And the book starts out with this, what does he call it, something like a dark and misty\n\n2:00:46.600 --> 2:00:50.040\n November mood.\n\n2:00:50.040 --> 2:00:55.400\n He's walking along the street and he's overcome by his, I can't remember what the word is,\n\n2:00:55.400 --> 2:00:56.400\n but his hypos.\n\n2:00:56.400 --> 2:00:58.000\n That's what he calls them.\n\n2:00:58.000 --> 2:00:59.280\n He's in a mood.\n\n2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:00.640\n He's depressed.\n\n2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:01.640\n He's down.\n\n2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:02.920\n Things are not going well.\n\n2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:05.080\n And that's where he starts.\n\n2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:14.040\n And he signs up to go on this whaling voyage with this captain Ahab, who is this incredibly\n\n2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:22.720\n charismatic, deeply disturbing character, who is a captain who's got lots of history\n\n2:01:22.720 --> 2:01:25.980\n and wants to go whaling, wants to get whales.\n\n2:01:25.980 --> 2:01:26.980\n That's what they do.\n\n2:01:26.980 --> 2:01:31.960\n They harpoon these whales and bring them back and sell the blubber and the oil and so on.\n\n2:01:31.960 --> 2:01:37.800\n So he's kind of rich and he's famous and he's powerful, he's an authority figure.\n\n2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:44.200\n And he is megalomaniacally obsessed with getting one particular whale, which is called Moby\n\n2:01:44.200 --> 2:01:45.200\n Dick.\n\n2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:51.240\n And Moby Dick is like the largest, the whitest, the sort of most terrifying of all the whales.\n\n2:01:51.240 --> 2:01:56.800\n And Ahab wants to get him because a number of years earlier, he had an encounter with\n\n2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:00.600\n Moby Dick where Moby Dick bit off his leg.\n\n2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:08.480\n And he survived, but he had this deeply religious experience in the wake of it.\n\n2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:12.240\n And he needed to find out what the meaning of that was.\n\n2:02:12.240 --> 2:02:14.460\n What is the meaning of my suffering?\n\n2:02:14.460 --> 2:02:20.480\n Who am I such that the world and Moby Dick, this leviathan at the center of it should\n\n2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:22.680\n treat me this way.\n\n2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:29.200\n And so his task is not just to go whaling, it's to figure out the meaning of the universe\n\n2:02:29.200 --> 2:02:36.320\n through going whaling and having a confrontation with his tormentor, this whale, Moby Dick.\n\n2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:41.600\n And the confrontation is so weird because Melville points out that whales, their faces\n\n2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:49.600\n are so huge, their foreheads are so huge, and their eyes are on the side of them that\n\n2:02:49.600 --> 2:02:52.560\n you can never actually look them in the eye.\n\n2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:57.840\n And it's kind of a metaphor for God, like you can't ever look God in the face.\n\n2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:00.160\n That's the sort of traditional thing to say about God.\n\n2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:05.980\n You can't find the ultimate meaning of the universe by looking God in the face.\n\n2:03:05.980 --> 2:03:07.520\n But Ahab wants to.\n\n2:03:07.520 --> 2:03:13.320\n He says he's got a pasteboard mask of a face, but I'll strike through the mask and find\n\n2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:15.280\n out what's behind.\n\n2:03:15.280 --> 2:03:19.880\n And so Ishmael is sort of caught up in this thing, and he's like going whaling because\n\n2:03:19.880 --> 2:03:24.080\n he's in a bad mood, and maybe this will make things better.\n\n2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:28.080\n And he makes friends with this guy Queequeg.\n\n2:03:28.080 --> 2:03:30.600\n And Queequeg is a pagan.\n\n2:03:30.600 --> 2:03:33.440\n He's from an island in the South Pacific.\n\n2:03:33.440 --> 2:03:38.560\n And he's got tattoos all over his body, head to toe.\n\n2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:45.500\n He's party colored, like every different color, says Ishmael, is these tattoos.\n\n2:03:45.500 --> 2:03:54.680\n And they are the writing on his body, he says, of the immutable mysteries of the universe\n\n2:03:54.680 --> 2:03:58.520\n as understood through his culture.\n\n2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:06.280\n And so somehow Queequeg is this character who is like not Christian at all.\n\n2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:09.360\n And he's powerful in a very different way than Ahab is.\n\n2:04:09.360 --> 2:04:13.240\n He's supposed to be the king, he's the son of the king, and probably his father's died\n\n2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:14.240\n by now.\n\n2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:15.840\n If he was home, he'd be the king.\n\n2:04:15.840 --> 2:04:19.960\n But he's off on a voyage too, trying to understand who he is before he goes back and leads his\n\n2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:21.000\n people.\n\n2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:25.400\n And he's a harpooner, the bravest of the people on the ship.\n\n2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:32.760\n And he's got the mystery of the universe tattooed on his body, but nobody can understand it.\n\n2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:39.280\n And it's through his relation with Queequeg that Ishmael comes to get a different understanding\n\n2:04:39.280 --> 2:04:40.760\n of what we might be about.\n\n2:04:40.760 --> 2:04:45.260\n So that's Moby Dick in a nutshell.\n\n2:04:45.260 --> 2:04:51.280\n And connected to a book I have read, which is funny, there's probably echoes that represent\n\n2:04:51.280 --> 2:05:01.280\n the 20th century now in Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway that also has similar, I guess,\n\n2:05:01.280 --> 2:05:09.320\n themes, but more personal, more focused on the, I mean, I guess it's less about God.\n\n2:05:09.320 --> 2:05:13.520\n It's almost more like the existentialist version of Moby Dick.\n\n2:05:13.520 --> 2:05:14.520\n And hence shorter.\n\n2:05:14.520 --> 2:05:15.520\n And a lot shorter.\n\n2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:16.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:18.360\n Well, Hemingway was brilliant that way.\n\n2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:23.880\n But do you see echoes and do you find Old Man and the Sea interesting?\n\n2:05:23.880 --> 2:05:29.920\n It's been since ninth grade that I read Old Man and the Sea even longer ago than The Fountainhead.\n\n2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:31.480\n So I didn't know we were going to go there.\n\n2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:37.380\n I mean, I find Hemingway interesting, but Hemingway, my general sort of picture of him\n\n2:05:37.380 --> 2:05:44.360\n is that we have to confront the dangers and the difficulties of our life.\n\n2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.320\n We have to develop in ourselves a certain kind of courage and manliness.\n\n2:05:48.320 --> 2:05:50.720\n And I think there's something interesting about that.\n\n2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:54.160\n He's for risk in a certain way.\n\n2:05:54.160 --> 2:05:56.800\n And I think that's important.\n\n2:05:56.800 --> 2:06:02.800\n But now I don't have any right to say this since it's been so long since I read it.\n\n2:06:02.800 --> 2:06:11.840\n I do feel like there's, I don't remember a sense for quite the tragedy of it.\n\n2:06:11.840 --> 2:06:12.840\n Maybe there is.\n\n2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:14.200\n Is it a melancholy novel?\n\n2:06:14.200 --> 2:06:15.200\n I don't even remember.\n\n2:06:15.200 --> 2:06:20.160\n No, it's, I mean, it has a sense like The Stranger by Camus.\n\n2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:25.120\n It has a sense of like, this is how life is.\n\n2:06:25.120 --> 2:06:34.080\n And it has more about old age and that you're not quite the man you used to be feeling of\n\n2:06:34.080 --> 2:06:36.760\n like, this is how time passes.\n\n2:06:36.760 --> 2:06:44.280\n And then the passing of time and how you get older and this is one last fish.\n\n2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:46.560\n It's less about this is the fish.\n\n2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:49.640\n It's more like this is one last fish.\n\n2:06:49.640 --> 2:06:56.960\n And asking, who was I as a man, as a human being in this world?\n\n2:06:56.960 --> 2:07:00.400\n And this one fish helps you ask that question fully.\n\n2:07:00.400 --> 2:07:01.400\n Wonderful.\n\n2:07:01.400 --> 2:07:06.560\n But it's one fish, which is just sort of all the other fish too.\n\n2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:13.560\n And that is a big difference because for Ahab, no other fish will do than Moby Dick.\n\n2:07:13.560 --> 2:07:18.160\n It's gotta be the biggest, the most powerful, the most tormenting.\n\n2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:22.640\n It's gotta be the one that you've got history with that has defiled you.\n\n2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:28.160\n And it's a raucous ride, Moby Dick.\n\n2:07:28.160 --> 2:07:29.960\n What about David Foster Wallace?\n\n2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:36.120\n So why is he important to you in the search of meaning in a secular age?\n\n2:07:36.120 --> 2:07:37.120\n Good.\n\n2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:41.840\n So I'll just, just to finish the Moby Dick thing, I think what's interesting about Melville\n\n2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:47.280\n is that he thinks our salvation comes not if we get in the right relation to monotheism\n\n2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:52.120\n or Christianity, but if we get in the right relation to polytheism, to the idea that there's\n\n2:07:52.120 --> 2:07:59.440\n not a unity to our existence, but there are lots of little meanings and they don't cohere.\n\n2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:05.680\n Sometimes like in Homer, sometimes you're in love.\n\n2:08:05.680 --> 2:08:09.160\n Helen's in love with Paris and they do crazy things.\n\n2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:12.420\n They go off and run away and the Trojan war begins.\n\n2:08:12.420 --> 2:08:15.120\n And sometimes you're in a battle fury.\n\n2:08:15.120 --> 2:08:16.520\n Love is Aphrodite's realm.\n\n2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:20.560\n And the battle fury, that's Aries realm and that's a totally different world.\n\n2:08:20.560 --> 2:08:22.840\n And they're not even, I mean, they're related.\n\n2:08:22.840 --> 2:08:25.840\n There's a kind of family resemblance, but not much.\n\n2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:30.320\n Mostly you're just in different sort of local meaningful worlds.\n\n2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:36.420\n And Melville seems to think that that's a thing that we could aim to bring back.\n\n2:08:36.420 --> 2:08:43.940\n He says we have to lure back the Merry May Day gods of old and lovingly enthrone them\n\n2:08:43.940 --> 2:08:48.040\n in the now egotistical sky, the now unhaunted hill.\n\n2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:52.120\n That's what we live in this world where hills aren't haunted with significance anymore.\n\n2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:57.880\n And the sky is just a bunch of stuff that we're studying with physics and astrophysics\n\n2:08:57.880 --> 2:08:58.880\n and stuff.\n\n2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:04.080\n But they used to be awe inspiring and we have to figure out how to get in that relation\n\n2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:09.320\n to them, but not by trying to give a unity to our existence through developing habits\n\n2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:12.300\n and practices that get written on our body.\n\n2:09:12.300 --> 2:09:19.840\n And so his is about the end of Judeo Christianity and the sort of Roman appropriation of it.\n\n2:09:19.840 --> 2:09:25.320\n In Wallace, one of the things I think is so interesting about him is that I think he is\n\n2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:29.460\n a great observer of the contemporary world.\n\n2:09:29.460 --> 2:09:33.120\n And he's a very funny writer, he's really funny.\n\n2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:38.460\n But he's a great observer of the contemporary world and what he thought was at the core\n\n2:09:38.460 --> 2:09:44.160\n of the contemporary world was this constant temptation to diversion through entertainment.\n\n2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:49.920\n That's a different story than Heidegger's story about efficiency and optimization, but\n\n2:09:49.920 --> 2:09:51.760\n it's the other side of it.\n\n2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:55.840\n What is this temptation sort of diverting us from?\n\n2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:58.520\n The ability to be more efficient.\n\n2:09:58.520 --> 2:10:05.520\n So you're tempted to go watch some stupid film or television show or something that's\n\n2:10:05.520 --> 2:10:11.400\n dumb and not really very interesting, but you read that temptation as a temptation precisely\n\n2:10:11.400 --> 2:10:16.000\n in virtue of it's taking you away from your optimizing your existence.\n\n2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.040\n And so I think there are two sides of the same coin.\n\n2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:20.320\n I think he's brilliant at describing it.\n\n2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:26.340\n I think he thought it was a desperate position to be in, that it was something that we needed\n\n2:10:26.340 --> 2:10:33.080\n to confront and find a way out of and his characters are trying to do that.\n\n2:10:33.080 --> 2:10:39.040\n And I think there's two different David Foster Wallace's, one, I mean, David Foster Wallace\n\n2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:42.740\n committed suicide and it's very sad.\n\n2:10:42.740 --> 2:10:49.720\n And he clearly did have sort of, there was a physiological basis to his condition.\n\n2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:55.640\n He knew it, he was treating it for decades with medication, he had electroshock therapy\n\n2:10:55.640 --> 2:11:00.220\n a number of times, it's just very, very sad story.\n\n2:11:00.220 --> 2:11:04.240\n When I decided that we were going to write about David Foster Wallace, the first thing\n\n2:11:04.240 --> 2:11:12.720\n I was worried about is can you, like obviously a motivating factor, maybe the motivating\n\n2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:17.400\n factor in his committing suicide was his physiological condition.\n\n2:11:17.400 --> 2:11:25.120\n But there was a question, could you think, I mean, he's obsessed with the condition with\n\n2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:32.040\n what we need to do to achieve our salvation, to live well, to make our lives worth living.\n\n2:11:32.040 --> 2:11:37.300\n And he clearly in the end felt like he couldn't do that.\n\n2:11:37.300 --> 2:11:41.960\n So in addition to the physiological thing, which probably most of it, the question for\n\n2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:49.960\n me was, could you find in his writing what he was identifying as the thing we needed\n\n2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:54.800\n to be doing that he nevertheless felt we couldn't be doing?\n\n2:11:54.800 --> 2:12:00.060\n And he talks as if that's the difficulty for him.\n\n2:12:00.060 --> 2:12:03.960\n So that's one side of him and I did want to find that.\n\n2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:06.800\n I think there's another side of him that's very different, but you were going to ask\n\n2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:07.800\n something.\n\n2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:08.800\n No, please, what's the other side?\n\n2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:19.120\n I mean, what I write about in the chapter mostly is what I think he's got as our saving\n\n2:12:19.120 --> 2:12:21.040\n possibility.\n\n2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:25.360\n He thinks our saving possibility, he says this in a graduation speech that he gave to\n\n2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:33.580\n Kenyon, is that we have the freedom to interpret situations however we like.\n\n2:12:33.580 --> 2:12:36.480\n So what's the problem case for him?\n\n2:12:36.480 --> 2:12:40.480\n He says, look, the problem case, we have it all the time.\n\n2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:44.400\n You get pissed off at the world.\n\n2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:50.760\n Some big SUV cuts you off on the highway and you're pissed off and you might express your\n\n2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:56.520\n anger with one finger or another directed at that person.\n\n2:12:56.520 --> 2:13:05.200\n And he says, but actually, you're being pissed off as the result of your having made an assumption.\n\n2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:08.680\n And the assumption is that that action was directed at you.\n\n2:13:08.680 --> 2:13:14.980\n Like the assumption is that you're the center of the universe and you shouldn't assume that.\n\n2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:21.880\n And the way to talk yourself out of it, he says, is to recognize the possibility that\n\n2:13:21.880 --> 2:13:25.520\n maybe that wasn't an action directed at you.\n\n2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:34.520\n Maybe that guy is racing to the hospital to take care of his dying spouse who's been there\n\n2:13:34.520 --> 2:13:43.100\n suffering from cancer, or maybe he's on the way to pick up a sick child, or maybe he's...\n\n2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:47.800\n And it's not an action directed, that was your assumption, not something that was inherent\n\n2:13:47.800 --> 2:13:49.320\n in the situation.\n\n2:13:49.320 --> 2:13:52.160\n And I think there's something interesting about that.\n\n2:13:52.160 --> 2:13:55.000\n I think there's something right about that.\n\n2:13:55.000 --> 2:14:04.040\n At the same time, I don't think he speaks as if we can just spin out these stories and\n\n2:14:04.040 --> 2:14:07.060\n whether they're true or not doesn't matter.\n\n2:14:07.060 --> 2:14:11.320\n What matters is that they free us from this assumption.\n\n2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:15.600\n And I think they only free us from this assumption if they're true.\n\n2:14:15.600 --> 2:14:20.140\n Like sometimes the guy really did direct it at you and that's part of the situation.\n\n2:14:20.140 --> 2:14:23.240\n And you can't pretend that it's not part of the situation.\n\n2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:25.440\n You have to find the right way of dealing with that situation.\n\n2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:31.060\n So you have to listen to what's actually happening and then you have to figure out how to make\n\n2:14:31.060 --> 2:14:32.100\n it right.\n\n2:14:32.100 --> 2:14:35.180\n And I think he thinks that we have too much freedom.\n\n2:14:35.180 --> 2:14:38.320\n He thinks that you don't have to listen to the situation, you can just tell whatever\n\n2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:40.920\n story you like about it.\n\n2:14:40.920 --> 2:14:43.760\n And I think that's actually too tough.\n\n2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.160\n I don't think we have that kind of freedom.\n\n2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:51.980\n And he writes these sort of incredibly moving letters when he's trying to write The Pale\n\n2:14:51.980 --> 2:14:58.480\n King, which is the unfinished novel that really sort of drove him to distraction.\n\n2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:03.000\n At the center of the novel is this character who...\n\n2:15:03.000 --> 2:15:08.920\n One of the characters at the center of the novel is a guy who's doing the most boring\n\n2:15:08.920 --> 2:15:11.340\n thing you could possibly imagine.\n\n2:15:11.340 --> 2:15:14.280\n He is an IRS tax examiner.\n\n2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:19.360\n He's going over other people's tax returns, trying to figure out whether they followed\n\n2:15:19.360 --> 2:15:21.580\n the rules or not.\n\n2:15:21.580 --> 2:15:27.360\n And just the idea of doing that for eight hours a day is just terrifying.\n\n2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:34.460\n And he puts this guy in a enormous warehouse that extends for miles where person after\n\n2:15:34.460 --> 2:15:42.520\n person after person is in rows of desks, sort of nameless, each of them doing this task.\n\n2:15:42.520 --> 2:15:48.020\n So he's in nowhere doing nothing and it's got to be intensely boring.\n\n2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:53.500\n And now the main character is trying to teach himself to do that.\n\n2:15:53.500 --> 2:15:56.520\n And the question is, how do you put up with the boredom?\n\n2:15:56.520 --> 2:16:01.120\n How do you put up with this onslaught of meaninglessness?\n\n2:16:01.120 --> 2:16:11.880\n And the main character is able to confront that condition with such bliss that he literally\n\n2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:17.240\n levitates from happiness while he's going over other people's tax returns.\n\n2:16:17.240 --> 2:16:22.960\n And that's my metaphor for what I think Wallace must have imagined we have to try to aspire\n\n2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:24.360\n to.\n\n2:16:24.360 --> 2:16:25.760\n And I think that's unlivable.\n\n2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:29.440\n I think that's not an ambition that we could achieve.\n\n2:16:29.440 --> 2:16:31.840\n I think there's something else we could achieve.\n\n2:16:31.840 --> 2:16:38.320\n And the other thing that we can achieve that I think is something that he also is onto\n\n2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:47.880\n but doesn't write about as often is something more like achieving peak moments of significance\n\n2:16:47.880 --> 2:16:50.920\n in a situation when something great happens.\n\n2:16:50.920 --> 2:16:54.500\n And he writes about this in an article about Roger Federer.\n\n2:16:54.500 --> 2:16:55.760\n He loved tennis.\n\n2:16:55.760 --> 2:16:57.160\n Are you a tennis lover?\n\n2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:01.160\n I'm not a lover of tennis, but I played tennis for 15 years and so on.\n\n2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:07.840\n I don't love it the way people love baseball, for example, I see the beauty in it, the artistry.\n\n2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:09.560\n I just liked it as a sport.\n\n2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:10.560\n Good.\n\n2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:11.560\n Okay.\n\n2:17:11.560 --> 2:17:14.680\n Well, I didn't play much tennis, but I hit a ball around every once in a while as a kid.\n\n2:17:14.680 --> 2:17:17.640\n And I always thought it was boring to watch.\n\n2:17:17.640 --> 2:17:22.040\n But reading David Foster Wallace on Roger Federer, you're like, wow, I've been missing\n\n2:17:22.040 --> 2:17:23.040\n something.\n\n2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:27.200\n And the article which appeared in the New York Times Magazine was called Roger Federer\n\n2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:28.200\n as Religious Experience.\n\n2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:29.200\n Oh, wow.\n\n2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:30.200\n There you go.\n\n2:17:30.200 --> 2:17:36.920\n And he says, look, there's something astonishing about watching someone who's got a body like\n\n2:17:36.920 --> 2:17:40.640\n us and having a body as a limitation.\n\n2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:47.040\n It's like the sight of sores and pains and agony and exhaustion.\n\n2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:51.040\n And it's the thing that dies in the end.\n\n2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:53.240\n And so it's what we have to confront.\n\n2:17:53.240 --> 2:17:56.600\n I mean, there's also joys that go along with having a body.\n\n2:17:56.600 --> 2:17:58.800\n Like if you didn't have a body, there'd be no sex.\n\n2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:04.640\n If you didn't have a body, there'd be no sort of physical excitement and so on.\n\n2:18:04.640 --> 2:18:11.040\n But somehow having a body is essentially a limitation that when you watch someone who's\n\n2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:17.360\n got one and is extraordinary at the way they use it, you can recognize how that limitation\n\n2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:20.480\n can be to some degree transcended.\n\n2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:26.560\n And that's what we can get when we watch Federer or some other great athlete sort of doing\n\n2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:31.280\n these things that transcend the limitations of their bodies.\n\n2:18:31.280 --> 2:18:37.120\n And that that's the kind of peak experience that we're capable of that could be a kind\n\n2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:38.120\n of salvation.\n\n2:18:38.120 --> 2:18:40.200\n That's a very different story.\n\n2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:42.860\n And I think that's a livable story.\n\n2:18:42.860 --> 2:18:48.860\n And I don't know if it would have saved him, but I feel like I wish he'd developed that\n\n2:18:48.860 --> 2:18:50.880\n side of the story more.\n\n2:18:50.880 --> 2:18:51.880\n Can we talk about...\n\n2:18:51.880 --> 2:18:57.440\n And first of all, let me just comment that I deeply appreciate that you said you were\n\n2:18:57.440 --> 2:18:59.240\n going to say something.\n\n2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:01.600\n The fact that you're listening to me is amazing.\n\n2:19:01.600 --> 2:19:05.820\n Like that you care about other humans and I really appreciate that.\n\n2:19:05.820 --> 2:19:07.840\n We should be in this way listening to the world.\n\n2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:14.200\n So that's a meta comment about many of the things we're talking about.\n\n2:19:14.200 --> 2:19:20.480\n But you mentioned something about levitating and a task that is infinitely boring and contrasting\n\n2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:28.560\n that with essentially levitating on a task that is great, like the highest achievement\n\n2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:33.400\n of this physical limiting body in playing tennis.\n\n2:19:33.400 --> 2:19:38.760\n Now I often say this, I don't know where I heard David Foster Wallace say this, but he\n\n2:19:38.760 --> 2:19:44.640\n said that the key to life is to be unborable, that is the embodiment of this philosophy.\n\n2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:52.080\n And when people ask me for advice, young students, I don't find this interesting, I don't find\n\n2:19:52.080 --> 2:19:55.040\n this interesting, how do I find the thing I'm passionate for?\n\n2:19:55.040 --> 2:19:59.840\n This would be very interesting to explore because you kind of say that that may not\n\n2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:04.340\n be a realizable thing to do, which is to be unborable.\n\n2:20:04.340 --> 2:20:11.000\n So my advice usually is life is amazing, like you should be able to, you should strive to\n\n2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:17.720\n discover the joy, the levitation in everything.\n\n2:20:17.720 --> 2:20:22.580\n And the thing you get stuck on for a longer period of time, that might be the thing you\n\n2:20:22.580 --> 2:20:26.560\n should stick to, but everything should be full of joy.\n\n2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:33.800\n So that kind of cynicism of saying life is boring is a thing that will prevent you from\n\n2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:42.120\n discovering the thing that will give you deep meaning and joy, but you're saying being unborable\n\n2:20:42.120 --> 2:20:45.760\n is not actionable for a human being.\n\n2:20:45.760 --> 2:20:49.640\n So okay, excellent question, deep question.\n\n2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:56.480\n And you might think because of the title of the book that Bert and I wrote, All Things\n\n2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:02.160\n Shining, that I think all things are shining.\n\n2:21:02.160 --> 2:21:07.560\n But actually, I think it's an unachievable goal to be unborable.\n\n2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:14.480\n I do believe that you're right, that a lot of times when people are bored with something,\n\n2:21:14.480 --> 2:21:16.840\n it's because they haven't tried hard enough.\n\n2:21:16.840 --> 2:21:21.940\n And I do think quite a lot of what makes people bored with something is that they haven't\n\n2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:27.840\n paid attention well enough and that they haven't listened, as you were saying.\n\n2:21:27.840 --> 2:21:30.240\n So I do think there's something to that.\n\n2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:32.460\n I think that's a deep insight.\n\n2:21:32.460 --> 2:21:40.240\n On the other hand, the perfection of that insight is that nothing is ever anything less\n\n2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:42.440\n than joyful.\n\n2:21:42.440 --> 2:21:52.480\n And I actually think that Dostoevsky and Melville both agree, but in very different ways, that\n\n2:21:52.480 --> 2:21:59.760\n life involves a wide range of moods and that all of them are important.\n\n2:21:59.760 --> 2:22:01.280\n It involves grief.\n\n2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:05.720\n I think when someone dies, it's appropriate to grieve.\n\n2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:09.780\n And it's not in the first instance joyful.\n\n2:22:09.780 --> 2:22:17.480\n It's related to joy because it makes the joys you feel when you feel them more intense.\n\n2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:24.240\n But it makes them more intense by putting you in the position of experiencing the opposite.\n\n2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:31.920\n And it's only because we're capable of a wide range of passionate responses to situations\n\n2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:36.580\n that I think the significances can be as meaningful as they are.\n\n2:22:36.580 --> 2:22:41.080\n So Melville, again, has this sort of interest.\n\n2:22:41.080 --> 2:22:45.640\n Let's just say the guilt and the grief in the brothers Karamazov.\n\n2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:49.080\n Alyosha loses his mentor, Father Zosima.\n\n2:22:49.080 --> 2:22:50.160\n He's grieving.\n\n2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:52.640\n It's super important that he's grieving.\n\n2:22:52.640 --> 2:22:59.160\n He has a religious conversion on the basis of grieving where he sees the deep beauty\n\n2:22:59.160 --> 2:23:04.980\n of everything that is, but it comes through the grief, not by avoiding the grief.\n\n2:23:04.980 --> 2:23:10.100\n And Melville says something like, Ishmael says something like, he says, I'm like a Catskill\n\n2:23:10.100 --> 2:23:13.360\n mountain eagle, the Catskills mountains nearby.\n\n2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:20.600\n He says, who's flying high above the earth, going over the peaks and down into the valleys.\n\n2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:26.540\n I have these ups and these downs, but they're all invested with a kind of significance.\n\n2:23:26.540 --> 2:23:31.320\n They all happen at an enormously high height because it's through the mountains that I'm\n\n2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:32.320\n flying.\n\n2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:35.200\n And even when I'm down, it's a way of being up.\n\n2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:37.480\n But it's really down.\n\n2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:40.560\n It's just that it's a way of being up because it makes the ups even upper.\n\n2:23:40.560 --> 2:23:46.680\n Well, I guess then the perfectionism of that can be destructive.\n\n2:23:46.680 --> 2:23:56.880\n I tend to see, for example, grief, a loss of love as part of love in that it's a celebration\n\n2:23:56.880 --> 2:24:02.040\n of the richness of feelings you had when you had the love.\n\n2:24:02.040 --> 2:24:07.080\n So it's all part of the same experience, but if you turn it into an optimization problem\n\n2:24:07.080 --> 2:24:13.480\n where everything can be unboreable, then that can in itself be destructive.\n\n2:24:13.480 --> 2:24:20.200\n I heard this interview with David Foster Wallace on the internet where it's a video of him\n\n2:24:20.200 --> 2:24:24.120\n and there is like a foreign sounding reporter asking him questions.\n\n2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:29.120\n I think there's an accent of some sort, German, I think, something like that.\n\n2:24:29.120 --> 2:24:32.760\n And I don't know, it just painted a picture of such a human person.\n\n2:24:32.760 --> 2:24:35.040\n We were talking about listening.\n\n2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:41.400\n The interviewer, if I may say, wasn't a very good one in the beginning.\n\n2:24:41.400 --> 2:24:47.720\n So she kind of walked in doing the usual journalistic things of just kind of generic questions and\n\n2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:50.720\n just kind of asking very basic questions.\n\n2:24:50.720 --> 2:24:53.900\n But he brought out something in her over time.\n\n2:24:53.900 --> 2:25:00.600\n And he was so sensitive and so sensitive to her and also sensitive to being a thinking\n\n2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:05.080\n and acting human in this world that just painted such a beautiful picture that people should\n\n2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:07.120\n go definitely check out.\n\n2:25:07.120 --> 2:25:14.160\n It made me really sad that we don't get this kind of picture of other thinkers, all of\n\n2:25:14.160 --> 2:25:19.400\n the ones we've been talking about, just that almost this little accidental view of this\n\n2:25:19.400 --> 2:25:20.400\n human being.\n\n2:25:20.400 --> 2:25:21.400\n I don't know.\n\n2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:25.640\n It was a beautiful one and I guess there's not many like that even of him.\n\n2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:26.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:27.640\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:33.600\n No, I think he was more than his writing ability, which was extraordinary.\n\n2:25:33.600 --> 2:25:42.640\n He had developed a style that was, I think, unlike anyone else's style, was his sensitivity\n\n2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:51.060\n to other people and to sort of what he was there to pay attention to.\n\n2:25:51.060 --> 2:25:57.280\n In one of his essays, I think it's the one called An Incredibly Fun Thing I'll Never\n\n2:25:57.280 --> 2:25:58.280\n Do Again.\n\n2:25:58.280 --> 2:26:00.640\n Do you know that one about cruise ships?\n\n2:26:00.640 --> 2:26:07.040\n I think he describes himself as this sort of roving eyeball that just sort of walks\n\n2:26:07.040 --> 2:26:14.240\n around the ship noticing things and he was incredibly good at that.\n\n2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:20.600\n But I also worry that that reflects something that you find in Ivan in The Brothers Karamazov.\n\n2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:27.000\n Ivan, I don't know if you remember this part, when he's away at school, at college as a\n\n2:26:27.000 --> 2:26:35.320\n young boy, he makes money by going around town to where tragic events have occurred.\n\n2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:40.960\n Someone just got run over by a carriage or something just happened.\n\n2:26:40.960 --> 2:26:45.640\n Being the first one there, he always knows somehow where these things are going to happen\n\n2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:54.200\n and writing about it, giving this really good description and then signing it eyewitness.\n\n2:26:54.200 --> 2:27:01.800\n It's as if Ivan's understanding of his life is that he was supposed to be a witness to\n\n2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:02.800\n it.\n\n2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:05.840\n He was supposed to see others but not get involved.\n\n2:27:05.840 --> 2:27:09.360\n He never is interested in trying to keep the bad things from happening.\n\n2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:12.480\n He just wants to report on them when he sees them.\n\n2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:19.160\n And I think that he's an incredibly isolated person, character, and it's his isolation\n\n2:27:19.160 --> 2:27:27.240\n from others, from the love of others and his inability, his desire not to love others because\n\n2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:34.840\n that attaches him to someone that I think is really at the ground of his condition.\n\n2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:39.440\n And I think that aim to be isolated, which many people have nowadays.\n\n2:27:39.440 --> 2:27:45.840\n You see it in The Underground Man too, just sort of taking yourself out of the world because\n\n2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:50.800\n you don't wanna have to take responsibility for being involved with others.\n\n2:27:50.800 --> 2:27:57.040\n I think that's a bad move and I do worry that maybe, I mean, I never knew David Foster Wallace,\n\n2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:01.020\n I have no right to comment on his life.\n\n2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:08.200\n But he portrays himself in that one episode as a person who does that and I think that's\n\n2:28:08.200 --> 2:28:09.200\n dangerous.\n\n2:28:09.200 --> 2:28:13.600\n Yeah, there's some sense in which being sensitive to the world, like I find myself, the source\n\n2:28:13.600 --> 2:28:19.240\n of joy for me is just being really sensitive to the world, to experience.\n\n2:28:19.240 --> 2:28:25.200\n There's some way, it's quite brilliant what you're saying that that could be isolating.\n\n2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:32.440\n It's like Darwin studying a new kind of species on an island you don't want to interfere with.\n\n2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:36.900\n You find it so beautiful that you don't want to interfere with its beauty.\n\n2:28:36.900 --> 2:28:45.840\n So there is some sense in which that isolates you and then you find yourself deeply alone,\n\n2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:49.280\n away from the experiences that bring you joy.\n\n2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:52.640\n And that could be destructive.\n\n2:28:52.640 --> 2:29:00.360\n That's fascinating how that works and in his case, of course, some of it is just chemicals\n\n2:29:00.360 --> 2:29:09.160\n in his brain, but some of it is the path, his philosophy of life let him down.\n\n2:29:09.160 --> 2:29:16.200\n And that's the danger with Nietzsche too and gazing into the abyss.\n\n2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:25.160\n Your job is a difficult one because doing philosophy changes you and you may not know\n\n2:29:25.160 --> 2:29:32.180\n how it changes you until you're changed and you look in the mirror.\n\n2:29:32.180 --> 2:29:39.960\n You wrote a piece in MIT Tech Review saying that AI can't be an artist.\n\n2:29:39.960 --> 2:29:44.520\n Creativity is and always will be a human endeavor.\n\n2:29:44.520 --> 2:29:49.040\n You mentioned BERT and criticism of symbolic AI.\n\n2:29:49.040 --> 2:29:55.680\n Can you explain your view of criticizing the possible, the capacity for artistry and creativity\n\n2:29:55.680 --> 2:29:59.040\n in our robot friends?\n\n2:29:59.040 --> 2:30:03.040\n Yeah, I can try.\n\n2:30:03.040 --> 2:30:13.560\n So to make the argument, you have to have in mind what counts as art, what counts as\n\n2:30:13.560 --> 2:30:17.160\n a creative artistic act.\n\n2:30:17.160 --> 2:30:24.160\n I take it that just doing something new isn't sufficient.\n\n2:30:24.160 --> 2:30:29.520\n We say that good art is original, but not everything that's never been done before is\n\n2:30:29.520 --> 2:30:31.360\n good art.\n\n2:30:31.360 --> 2:30:36.040\n So there has to be more than just doing something new.\n\n2:30:36.040 --> 2:30:44.160\n It has to be somehow doing something new in a way that speaks to the audience or speaks\n\n2:30:44.160 --> 2:30:47.840\n to some portion of the audience at least.\n\n2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:55.400\n It has to be doing something new in such a way that some people who see or interact with\n\n2:30:55.400 --> 2:31:00.200\n it can see themselves anew in it.\n\n2:31:00.200 --> 2:31:09.040\n So I think that art is inherently a creative act, sorry, a kind of communicative act that\n\n2:31:09.040 --> 2:31:13.600\n it involves a relation with other people.\n\n2:31:13.600 --> 2:31:19.240\n So think about the conditions for that working.\n\n2:31:19.240 --> 2:31:23.360\n I talk in that article, I can't remember, something about new music.\n\n2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:28.080\n I think I don't talk about Stravinsky, but let's say Stravinsky.\n\n2:31:28.080 --> 2:31:34.920\n Stravinsky performs the Rite of Spring and there's riots.\n\n2:31:34.920 --> 2:31:39.780\n It is new and people hate it.\n\n2:31:39.780 --> 2:31:40.780\n People can't...\n\n2:31:40.780 --> 2:31:42.440\n It sounds like a cacophony.\n\n2:31:42.440 --> 2:31:44.240\n It sounds awful.\n\n2:31:44.240 --> 2:31:48.640\n It's written according to principles that are not like the principles of music composition\n\n2:31:48.640 --> 2:31:51.000\n that people are familiar with.\n\n2:31:51.000 --> 2:31:55.200\n So in some ways it's a failed communicative act.\n\n2:31:55.200 --> 2:32:02.220\n But as Nietzsche says about his own stuff, we now can recognize that it wasn't a failed\n\n2:32:02.220 --> 2:32:09.160\n communicative act, it just hadn't reached its time yet.\n\n2:32:09.160 --> 2:32:16.000\n And now that way of composing music is like it's in Disney movies.\n\n2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:22.040\n It's so part of our musical palette that we don't have that response.\n\n2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:23.760\n It changed us.\n\n2:32:23.760 --> 2:32:27.600\n It changed the way we understand what counts as good music.\n\n2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:29.720\n So that's a deep communicative act.\n\n2:32:29.720 --> 2:32:38.900\n It didn't perform its communication in that opening moment, but it did ultimately establish\n\n2:32:38.900 --> 2:32:42.400\n a new understanding for all of us of what counts as good art.\n\n2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:47.240\n And that's the kind of deep communication that I think good art can do.\n\n2:32:47.240 --> 2:32:55.320\n It can change our understanding of ourselves and of what a good manifestation of something\n\n2:32:55.320 --> 2:32:57.760\n of ourselves in a certain domain is.\n\n2:32:57.760 --> 2:33:04.400\n And you use the term socially embedded, that art is fundamentally socially embedded.\n\n2:33:04.400 --> 2:33:10.400\n And I really liked that term because I see like my love for artificial intelligence and\n\n2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:16.160\n the kind of system that we can bring to the world that could make for an interesting and\n\n2:33:16.160 --> 2:33:22.360\n more lively world and one that enriches human beings is one where the AI systems are deeply\n\n2:33:22.360 --> 2:33:26.280\n socially embedded.\n\n2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:31.000\n And that actually is in contrast to the way artificial intelligence have been talked about\n\n2:33:31.000 --> 2:33:36.240\n throughout its history and certainly now, both on the robotic side and the AI side,\n\n2:33:36.240 --> 2:33:42.640\n it's especially on the tech sector where the businesses around AI, they kind of want to\n\n2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:48.520\n create systems that are like servants to humans.\n\n2:33:48.520 --> 2:33:55.960\n And then humans do all the beautiful human messiness of where art will be part.\n\n2:33:55.960 --> 2:34:02.640\n I think that there is no reason why you can't integrate AI systems in the way you integrate\n\n2:34:02.640 --> 2:34:04.920\n new humans to the picture.\n\n2:34:04.920 --> 2:34:12.140\n There are just the full diversity and the flaws, all of that adds to the thing.\n\n2:34:12.140 --> 2:34:22.600\n Some people might say that AlphaZero is this system from DeepMind that was able to solve\n\n2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:26.860\n the game, it beat the best people in the world at the game of Go with no supervision from\n\n2:34:26.860 --> 2:34:28.120\n humans.\n\n2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:32.780\n But more interestingly to me on the side of creativity, it was able to surprise a lot\n\n2:34:32.780 --> 2:34:37.000\n of grandmasters with the kind of moves that came up with.\n\n2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:42.720\n To me, that's not the creativity, the magic that's socially embedded that we're talking\n\n2:34:42.720 --> 2:34:43.720\n about.\n\n2:34:43.720 --> 2:34:51.200\n That is merely revealing the limitations of humans to discover.\n\n2:34:51.200 --> 2:34:55.960\n It's like to solve a particular aspect of a math problem.\n\n2:34:55.960 --> 2:35:05.720\n I think creativity is not just even socially embedded, it's the way you're saying is part\n\n2:35:05.720 --> 2:35:11.320\n of the communicative act, it's the interactive, it's the dance with the culture.\n\n2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:18.320\n And so it has to be like for AlphaZero to be creative, truly creative, it would have\n\n2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:26.200\n to be integrated in a way where it has a Twitter account and it becomes aware of the impact\n\n2:35:26.200 --> 2:35:30.400\n it has on the other grandmasters with the moves that's coming up.\n\n2:35:30.400 --> 2:35:37.840\n And one of the fascinating things about AlphaZero, which I just love so much is, I don't know\n\n2:35:37.840 --> 2:35:38.840\n if you're familiar with chess.\n\n2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:39.840\n I am, yeah.\n\n2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:40.840\n Okay, okay.\n\n2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:47.520\n So it does certain things that most chess players, even at the highest level don't do,\n\n2:35:47.520 --> 2:35:54.120\n which is it sacrifices pieces, it gives pieces away and then waits like 10 moves before it\n\n2:35:54.120 --> 2:35:55.120\n pays you back.\n\n2:35:55.120 --> 2:35:58.640\n So it does, to me, that's beautiful.\n\n2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:05.720\n That's art if only AlphaZero understood the artistry of that, which is I'm going to mess\n\n2:36:05.720 --> 2:36:10.200\n with you psychologically because I'm going to do two things.\n\n2:36:10.200 --> 2:36:16.240\n One make you feel overconfident that you're doing well, but actually also once you realize\n\n2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:21.280\n you are playing AlphaZero that is much better than you, you're going to feel really nervous\n\n2:36:21.280 --> 2:36:24.780\n about what's on the way, like this is the calm before the storm.\n\n2:36:24.780 --> 2:36:30.100\n And that creates a beautiful psychological masterpiece of this chess game.\n\n2:36:30.100 --> 2:36:36.720\n If only AlphaZero was then messing with you additionally to that, like and was cognizant\n\n2:36:36.720 --> 2:36:39.120\n of us doing that, then it becomes art.\n\n2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:42.980\n And then it's integrated into society in that way.\n\n2:36:42.980 --> 2:36:50.440\n And I believe it doesn't have to actually have an understanding of the world in the\n\n2:36:50.440 --> 2:36:51.600\n way that humans have.\n\n2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:52.720\n It can have a different one.\n\n2:36:52.720 --> 2:36:58.660\n It can be like a child is clueless about so many aspects of the world and it's okay.\n\n2:36:58.660 --> 2:37:04.800\n And that's part of the magic of it, just being flawed, lacking understanding in all interesting\n\n2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:06.720\n kinds of ways, but interacting.\n\n2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:14.360\n And so to me it's possible to create art for AI, but exactly as you're saying in a deeply\n\n2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:16.240\n socially embedded way.\n\n2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:17.240\n Good.\n\n2:37:17.240 --> 2:37:23.640\n Well, I think we agree, but let me just highlight the thing that makes me think that we agree,\n\n2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:34.280\n which is that I think for people, for a community to allow themselves to recognize in a certain\n\n2:37:34.280 --> 2:37:40.320\n kind of creative act, I'm thinking of Stravinsky here, but we could think of a chess thing,\n\n2:37:40.320 --> 2:37:47.280\n to recognize in a certain kind of creative act a new and admirable worthy way of thinking\n\n2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:54.360\n about what's significant in the situation, you have to believe that it wasn't random.\n\n2:37:54.360 --> 2:38:01.920\n You have to believe that Stravinsky wrote that way because he was receptive to what\n\n2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:05.040\n needed to be said now.\n\n2:38:05.040 --> 2:38:14.280\n And so you said, if only AlphaZero could do all this by virtue of recognizing that this\n\n2:38:14.280 --> 2:38:18.840\n was the thing that needed to be done, then it would be socially embedded in the right\n\n2:38:18.840 --> 2:38:19.840\n way.\n\n2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:21.880\n And I think I agree with that.\n\n2:38:21.880 --> 2:38:29.160\n First of all, it's possible to do in a constrained domain, a game playing domain, go or chess,\n\n2:38:29.160 --> 2:38:33.680\n go is more complicated than chess, but either one of them, because there really are only\n\n2:38:33.680 --> 2:38:42.800\n a finite range of possibilities if you make the game end at a certain point, it's a combinatorial\n\n2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:43.800\n problem in the end.\n\n2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:50.360\n Now, obviously, AlphaZero doesn't solve the problem in a combinatorial way.\n\n2:38:50.360 --> 2:38:58.880\n That would be take too much energy, you couldn't do it, it explodes the problem.\n\n2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:03.960\n So it does it in this other way that's interesting, this pattern recognition way, roughly.\n\n2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:12.400\n And in that context, it may well be that it can see, having had lots and lots of experience\n\n2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:17.920\n in the training stuff against itself or against another version of itself, it can see that\n\n2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:21.240\n the sacrifice here is gonna pay dividends down the road.\n\n2:39:21.240 --> 2:39:29.600\n See, I put that in quotation marks, that's to say it's got a high weight to this move\n\n2:39:29.600 --> 2:39:36.480\n here as a result of experience in the past where that move down the line led to this\n\n2:39:36.480 --> 2:39:38.280\n improvement.\n\n2:39:38.280 --> 2:39:46.800\n So in that finite context, I think the game players can trust it and they talk that way.\n\n2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:49.440\n It's got a kind of authority.\n\n2:39:49.440 --> 2:39:55.840\n They say, I've read some people who said about AlphaZero when it played Go, it's like it's\n\n2:39:55.840 --> 2:39:58.580\n playing from the future.\n\n2:39:58.580 --> 2:40:06.160\n It's making these moves that are just outlandish and there's a kind of brilliance to them that\n\n2:40:06.160 --> 2:40:09.720\n we can't really understand, we'll be catching up to it forever.\n\n2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:15.280\n I think in that context, it's mapped the domain and the domain is mappable because it's a\n\n2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:18.220\n combinatorial problem roughly.\n\n2:40:18.220 --> 2:40:30.620\n But in something like music or art of a nonfinite form, it feels to me like it's a little harder\n\n2:40:30.620 --> 2:40:37.200\n for me to understand what the analog of our trusting that Stravinsky has recognized something\n\n2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:44.420\n about us that demands that he write this way, that doesn't seem like a finite thing in quite\n\n2:40:44.420 --> 2:40:45.420\n the same way.\n\n2:40:45.420 --> 2:40:48.720\n So now we could ask the system, why did you do it?\n\n2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:52.280\n We could ask Stravinsky, why did you do it?\n\n2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:59.400\n And maybe it will have answers, but then it's involved in a kind of communicative act.\n\n2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:05.360\n And I think lots of times artists will often say, look, I can't communicate better than\n\n2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:07.620\n what I've done in the piece of work.\n\n2:41:07.620 --> 2:41:08.620\n That is the statement.\n\n2:41:08.620 --> 2:41:15.840\n Yeah, we humans aren't able to answer the why either, but I do think the question here\n\n2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:23.120\n is, well, first of all, language is finite, certainly when expressed through a tweet.\n\n2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:25.620\n So it is also a combinatorial problem.\n\n2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:29.680\n The question is how much more difficult it is than chess.\n\n2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:38.140\n And I think all the same ways that we see the solutions to chess is deeply surprising\n\n2:41:38.140 --> 2:41:46.760\n when it was first addressed with IBM D Blue and then with AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, AlphaZero.\n\n2:41:46.760 --> 2:41:53.400\n I think in that same way, language can be addressed and communication can be addressed.\n\n2:41:53.400 --> 2:42:00.160\n I don't see, having done this podcast, many reasons why everything I'm doing, especially\n\n2:42:00.160 --> 2:42:06.300\n as a digital being on the internet, can't be done by an AI system eventually.\n\n2:42:06.300 --> 2:42:11.960\n So I think we're being very human centric in thinking we're special.\n\n2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:19.060\n I think one of the hardest things is the physical space, actually operating touch and the magic\n\n2:42:19.060 --> 2:42:24.080\n of body language and the music of all of that, because it's so deeply integrated through\n\n2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:29.560\n the long evolutionary process of what it's like to be on earth.\n\n2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:38.640\n What is fundamentally different and AI can catch up on is the way we apply our evolutionary\n\n2:42:38.640 --> 2:42:44.120\n history on the way we act on the internet, on the way we act online.\n\n2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:48.360\n And as more and more of the world becomes digital, you're now operating in a space where\n\n2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:56.080\n AI is behind much less so, like we're both starting at zero.\n\n2:42:56.080 --> 2:42:58.040\n I think that's super interesting.\n\n2:42:58.040 --> 2:43:02.080\n Do you know this, do you know this author, Brian Christian, is that someone you've ever\n\n2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:03.080\n heard of?\n\n2:43:03.080 --> 2:43:04.080\n That sounds familiar.\n\n2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:08.160\n He's a guy who competed in the, what is it called?\n\n2:43:08.160 --> 2:43:09.160\n The Loebner Competition.\n\n2:43:09.160 --> 2:43:10.160\n The Loebner Prize.\n\n2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:11.160\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:13.200\n Yeah, the Turing Test thing.\n\n2:43:13.200 --> 2:43:17.080\n And I'll just tell you the story, but I think it's directly related to the last thing you\n\n2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:21.160\n said about where we're starting in the same place.\n\n2:43:21.160 --> 2:43:27.680\n He competed in this competition, but not, he didn't enter a program that was supposed\n\n2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:30.800\n to try to pass the Turing Test.\n\n2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:36.200\n The Turing Test, there's three people, there's the judge, there's the program, and then there's\n\n2:43:36.200 --> 2:43:38.520\n someone who's a human, the way they do it.\n\n2:43:38.520 --> 2:43:42.040\n And the judge has got to figure out by asking questions, which is the computer and which\n\n2:43:42.040 --> 2:43:43.200\n is the human.\n\n2:43:43.200 --> 2:43:47.500\n So little known fact, there's two prizes in that competition.\n\n2:43:47.500 --> 2:43:51.960\n There's the most human computer prize, that's the computer that wins the most.\n\n2:43:51.960 --> 2:43:54.920\n And then there's the most human human prize.\n\n2:43:54.920 --> 2:44:00.220\n And he competed for the most human human prize, and he won it, he kept winning it.\n\n2:44:00.220 --> 2:44:07.780\n And so he tried to think about what it is that you have to be able to do in order to\n\n2:44:07.780 --> 2:44:11.080\n convince judges that you're human instead of a computer.\n\n2:44:11.080 --> 2:44:14.520\n And that's an interesting question, I think.\n\n2:44:14.520 --> 2:44:22.920\n And what he came to, my takeaway from his version of this story is that it is true that\n\n2:44:22.920 --> 2:44:29.880\n computers are winning these contests more and more as technology progresses.\n\n2:44:29.880 --> 2:44:32.800\n But there's two possible explanations for that.\n\n2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:38.240\n One is that the computers are becoming more human, and the other is that the humans are\n\n2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:41.580\n becoming more like computers.\n\n2:44:41.580 --> 2:44:52.040\n And he says, actually, the more we live our lives in this technological world where we\n\n2:44:52.040 --> 2:45:01.080\n have to moderate our behavior so that it's readable by something that's effectively a\n\n2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:04.760\n computer, the more we become like that.\n\n2:45:04.760 --> 2:45:09.320\n And he says, it happens even when you're not interacting with a computer.\n\n2:45:09.320 --> 2:45:14.720\n He says, have you ever been on the phone with a call center?\n\n2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:18.040\n And they're going through their script, and that's what they've got to do.\n\n2:45:18.040 --> 2:45:21.680\n They've got to go through their script because that's how they keep their job.\n\n2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:24.600\n And they ask you this question, you've got to answer it.\n\n2:45:24.600 --> 2:45:29.440\n And it's as if you're no longer interacting with a person, even though it's a person,\n\n2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:34.620\n because they've so given up everything that's involved normally with being able to make\n\n2:45:34.620 --> 2:45:38.840\n judgments and decisions and act in situations and take responsibility.\n\n2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:43.400\n And so I think that's the other side of it.\n\n2:45:43.400 --> 2:45:51.580\n It is true that technology is amazing and can solve huge ranges of problems and do fantastic\n\n2:45:51.580 --> 2:45:52.580\n things.\n\n2:45:52.580 --> 2:45:57.880\n But it's also true that we're changing ourselves in response to it.\n\n2:45:57.880 --> 2:46:03.240\n And the one thing I'm worried about is that we're changing ourselves in such a way that\n\n2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:10.520\n the norms for what we're aiming at are being changed to move in the direction of this sort\n\n2:46:10.520 --> 2:46:16.480\n of efficiently and in an optimized way solving a problem and move away from this other kind\n\n2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:22.280\n of thing that we were calling aliveness or significance.\n\n2:46:22.280 --> 2:46:25.040\n And so that's the other side of the story.\n\n2:46:25.040 --> 2:46:26.040\n And that's the worry.\n\n2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:32.000\n But it's very possible that there is, for you and I, the ancient dinosaurs, we may not\n\n2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:39.960\n see the aliveness in TikTok, the aliveness in the digital space, that you see it as us\n\n2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:49.480\n being dragged into this over optimized world, but that may be this is in fact, it is a world\n\n2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:55.000\n that opens up opportunities to truly experience life.\n\n2:46:55.000 --> 2:47:01.060\n And there's interesting to think about all the people growing up now, who their early\n\n2:47:01.060 --> 2:47:06.240\n experience of life is always mediated through a digital device, not always, but more and\n\n2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:11.560\n more often mediated through that device, and how we're both evolving, the technology is\n\n2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:16.640\n evolving and the humans are evolving to then maybe open a door to a whole world where the\n\n2:47:16.640 --> 2:47:22.840\n humans and the technology or AI systems are interacting as equals.\n\n2:47:22.840 --> 2:47:24.120\n So now I'm going to agree with you.\n\n2:47:24.120 --> 2:47:28.200\n You might be surprised that I'm going to agree with you, but I think that's exactly right.\n\n2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:34.240\n I don't want to be the person who's saying our job is to resist all of this stuff.\n\n2:47:34.240 --> 2:47:35.880\n I don't want to be a Luddite.\n\n2:47:35.880 --> 2:47:37.160\n That's not my goal.\n\n2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:46.760\n The goal is to point out that in the supreme danger lies the saving power.\n\n2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:52.280\n The point is to get in the right relation to that understanding of what we are.\n\n2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:54.520\n That allows us to find the joy in it.\n\n2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:56.920\n And I think that's a hard thing to do.\n\n2:47:56.920 --> 2:48:00.800\n It's hard to understand even what we're supposed to be doing when we do it.\n\n2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:06.120\n Maybe I, more than you, am not of the right generation to be able to do that.\n\n2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:07.640\n But I do think that's got to be the move.\n\n2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:09.300\n The move is not to resist it.\n\n2:48:09.300 --> 2:48:11.360\n It's not a nostalgic move.\n\n2:48:11.360 --> 2:48:17.160\n It's an attempt to push people to get in the relation to it that's not the relation of\n\n2:48:17.160 --> 2:48:22.960\n it controlling you and depriving you of stuff, but of your recognizing some great joy that\n\n2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:24.760\n can be found in it.\n\n2:48:24.760 --> 2:48:29.640\n When I interact with legged robots, I see there's magic there.\n\n2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:34.080\n And I just feel like the person who hears the music when others don't.\n\n2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:35.600\n And I don't know what that is.\n\n2:48:35.600 --> 2:48:38.440\n And I'd love to explore that.\n\n2:48:38.440 --> 2:48:43.040\n Because it's almost like the future talking.\n\n2:48:43.040 --> 2:48:45.280\n And I'm trying to hear what it's saying.\n\n2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:48.480\n Is this a dangerous world or is this a beautiful world?\n\n2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:51.680\n Well, I can certainly understand your enthusiasm for that.\n\n2:48:51.680 --> 2:48:56.560\n Those used to be things that I found overwhelmingly exciting.\n\n2:48:56.560 --> 2:49:01.480\n And I'm not sort of closed off from that anymore.\n\n2:49:01.480 --> 2:49:06.680\n I mean, I'm not now closed off from that even though my views are changed and I don't work\n\n2:49:06.680 --> 2:49:09.340\n in that world.\n\n2:49:09.340 --> 2:49:15.440\n But I think it's interesting to figure out what's at the ground of that response.\n\n2:49:15.440 --> 2:49:21.640\n We talked about meaning quite a bit throughout in a secular age, but let me ask you the big\n\n2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:25.320\n ridiculous question, almost too big.\n\n2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:28.000\n What is the meaning of this thing we got going on?\n\n2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:32.480\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:34.680\n You're saving the softball for the end, is that it?\n\n2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:35.680\n Easy one.\n\n2:49:35.680 --> 2:49:36.680\n Easy one.\n\n2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:37.920\n I don't know what the meaning of life is.\n\n2:49:37.920 --> 2:49:44.040\n I think there's something that characterizes us that's not the thing that people normally\n\n2:49:44.040 --> 2:49:46.620\n think characterizes us.\n\n2:49:46.620 --> 2:49:51.360\n The traditional thing to say and the philosophical tradition, even in the AI tradition, which\n\n2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:57.320\n is a kind of manifestation of philosophy from Plato forward.\n\n2:49:57.320 --> 2:50:02.200\n The traditional thing to say is that what characterizes us is our rationality, that\n\n2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:06.760\n we're intelligent beings, that we're the ones that think.\n\n2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:11.280\n And I think that's certainly part of what characterizes us.\n\n2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:14.840\n But I think there's more to it too.\n\n2:50:14.840 --> 2:50:27.200\n I think we're capable of experiencing simultaneously the complete and utter ungroundedness of everything\n\n2:50:27.200 --> 2:50:34.480\n that's meaningful in our existence and also the real significance of it.\n\n2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:38.200\n And that sounds like a contradiction.\n\n2:50:38.200 --> 2:50:42.280\n How could it really be significant and not be based on anything?\n\n2:50:42.280 --> 2:50:45.860\n But I think that's the contradiction that somehow characterizes us.\n\n2:50:45.860 --> 2:50:52.360\n And I think that we're the being that sort of has to hold that weird mystery before us\n\n2:50:52.360 --> 2:50:55.800\n and live in the light of it.\n\n2:50:55.800 --> 2:50:59.280\n That's the thing that I think is really at our core.\n\n2:50:59.280 --> 2:51:00.800\n And so how do we do that?\n\n2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:03.280\n I will say this one thing.\n\n2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:08.360\n And I learned it from a philosopher, from a guy named Albert Borgmann, who's a German\n\n2:51:08.360 --> 2:51:13.360\n philosopher who lives in Montana now, taught in Montana for his whole career.\n\n2:51:13.360 --> 2:51:16.840\n And I say this to my students at Harvard now.\n\n2:51:16.840 --> 2:51:21.020\n He said, this is the way that I think about my life, and I hope you'll think about your\n\n2:51:21.020 --> 2:51:22.020\n life too.\n\n2:51:22.020 --> 2:51:30.540\n He said, you should think about your life hoping that there will be many moments in\n\n2:51:30.540 --> 2:51:39.480\n it about which you can say, there's no place I'd rather be, there's no thing I'd rather\n\n2:51:39.480 --> 2:51:49.320\n be doing, there's nobody I'd rather be with, and this I will remember well.\n\n2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:54.280\n And I think if you can aim to fill your life with moments like that, it will be a meaningful\n\n2:51:54.280 --> 2:51:55.280\n one.\n\n2:51:55.280 --> 2:51:59.400\n I don't know if that's the meaning of life, but I think if you can hold that before you,\n\n2:51:59.400 --> 2:52:04.720\n it'll help to clarify this mystery and this sort of bizarre situation in which we find\n\n2:52:04.720 --> 2:52:05.720\n ourselves.\n\n2:52:05.720 --> 2:52:11.760\n Sean, this conversation was incredible, and those four requirements have certainly been\n\n2:52:11.760 --> 2:52:13.760\n fulfilled for me.\n\n2:52:13.760 --> 2:52:19.160\n This was a magical moment in that way, and I will remember it well.\n\n2:52:19.160 --> 2:52:20.160\n Thank you so much.\n\n2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:22.800\n It's an honor that you spend your valuable time with me.\n\n2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:23.800\n This was great.\n\n2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:24.800\n Thank you.\n\n2:52:24.800 --> 2:52:25.800\n Thank you for having me, Lex.\n\n2:52:25.800 --> 2:52:27.720\n I really, really enjoyed it.\n\n2:52:27.720 --> 2:52:30.440\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sean Kelly.\n\n2:52:30.440 --> 2:52:34.900\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:52:34.900 --> 2:52:39.000\n And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Camus.\n\n2:52:39.000 --> 2:52:46.480\n In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.\n\n2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:57.760\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
