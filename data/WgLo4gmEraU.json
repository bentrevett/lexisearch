inventor of loop quantum gravity,\n\n00:06.680 --> 00:08.860\n and a contributor of many interesting ideas\n\n00:08.860 --> 00:11.320\n to cosmology, quantum field theory,\n\n00:11.320 --> 00:12.960\n the foundations of quantum mechanics,\n\n00:12.960 --> 00:16.360\n theoretical biology, and the philosophy of science.\n\n00:16.360 --> 00:18.180\n He's the author of several books,\n\n00:18.180 --> 00:21.000\n including one that critiques the state of physics\n\n00:21.000 --> 00:24.080\n and string theory called The Trouble with Physics.\n\n00:24.080 --> 00:27.100\n And his latest book, Einstein's Unfinished Revolution,\n\n00:27.100 --> 00:30.240\n The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum.\n\n00:30.240 --> 00:32.880\n He's an outspoken personality in the public debates\n\n00:32.880 --> 00:34.600\n on the nature of our universe,\n\n00:34.600 --> 00:38.240\n among the top minds in the theoretical physics community.\n\n00:38.240 --> 00:41.000\n This community has its respected academics,\n\n00:41.000 --> 00:44.440\n its naked emperors, its outcasts and its revolutionaries,\n\n00:44.440 --> 00:46.900\n its madmen and its dreamers.\n\n00:46.900 --> 00:49.560\n This is why it's an exciting world to explore\n\n00:49.560 --> 00:51.800\n through a long form conversation.\n\n00:51.800 --> 00:53.800\n I recommend you listen back to the episodes\n\n00:53.800 --> 00:57.200\n with Leonard Susskind, Sean Carroll, Michio Okaku,\n\n00:57.200 --> 01:01.200\n Max Tegmark, Eric Weinstein, and Jim Gates.\n\n01:01.200 --> 01:03.860\n You might be asking, why talk to physicists\n\n01:03.860 --> 01:05.320\n if you're interested in AI?\n\n01:06.160 --> 01:08.800\n To me, creating artificial intelligence systems\n\n01:08.800 --> 01:11.400\n requires more than Python and deep learning.\n\n01:11.400 --> 01:13.360\n It requires that we return to exploring\n\n01:13.360 --> 01:18.360\n the fundamental nature of the universe and the human mind.\n\n01:18.520 --> 01:21.200\n Theoretical physicists venture out into the dark,\n\n01:21.200 --> 01:23.560\n mysterious, psychologically challenging place\n\n01:23.560 --> 01:27.160\n of first principles more than almost any other discipline.\n\n01:28.120 --> 01:30.880\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:30.880 --> 01:33.160\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:33.160 --> 01:34.960\n give it five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n01:34.960 --> 01:38.280\n support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:38.280 --> 01:41.480\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:42.440 --> 01:45.320\n As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now\n\n01:45.320 --> 01:46.640\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n01:46.640 --> 01:48.880\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n01:48.880 --> 01:50.200\n I hope that works for you\n\n01:50.200 --> 01:52.520\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n01:52.520 --> 01:54.480\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:54.480 --> 01:56.760\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:56.760 --> 02:00.200\n When you get it, use code LEXBODCAST.\n\n02:00.200 --> 02:02.400\n Cash App lets you send money to friends,\n\n02:02.400 --> 02:04.840\n buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market\n\n02:04.840 --> 02:06.760\n with as little as one dollar.\n\n02:06.760 --> 02:09.120\n Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,\n\n02:09.120 --> 02:11.360\n let me mention that cryptocurrency\n\n02:11.360 --> 02:14.640\n in the context of the history of money is fascinating.\n\n02:14.640 --> 02:18.440\n I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.\n\n02:18.440 --> 02:20.120\n Debits and credits on ledgers\n\n02:20.120 --> 02:23.320\n started around 30,000 years ago.\n\n02:23.320 --> 02:27.000\n The US dollar, of course, created over 200 years ago,\n\n02:27.000 --> 02:30.240\n and Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,\n\n02:30.240 --> 02:32.880\n was released just over 10 years ago.\n\n02:32.880 --> 02:35.880\n So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much\n\n02:35.880 --> 02:37.920\n in its early days of development,\n\n02:37.920 --> 02:39.560\n but it still is aiming to\n\n02:39.560 --> 02:43.040\n and just might redefine the nature of money.\n\n02:43.040 --> 02:45.360\n If you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play\n\n02:45.360 --> 02:49.080\n and use the code LEXBODCAST, you'll get $10,\n\n02:49.080 --> 02:51.920\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to First,\n\n02:51.920 --> 02:53.720\n one of my favorite organizations\n\n02:53.720 --> 02:56.880\n that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education\n\n02:56.880 --> 02:58.880\n for young people around the world.\n\n02:58.880 --> 03:02.240\n And now, here's my conversation with Lee Smolin.\n\n03:03.120 --> 03:04.280\n What is real?\n\n03:05.120 --> 03:06.440\n Let's start with an easy question.\n\n03:06.440 --> 03:09.160\n Put another way, how do we know what is real\n\n03:09.160 --> 03:10.680\n and what is merely a creation\n\n03:10.680 --> 03:14.240\n of our human perception and imagination?\n\n03:14.240 --> 03:15.640\n We don't know.\n\n03:15.640 --> 03:16.480\n We don't know.\n\n03:16.480 --> 03:17.320\n This is science.\n\n03:17.320 --> 03:19.960\n I presume we're talking about science.\n\n03:19.960 --> 03:23.280\n And we believe, or I believe,\n\n03:24.320 --> 03:28.520\n that there is a world that is independent of my existence\n\n03:28.520 --> 03:32.520\n and my experience about it and my knowledge of it,\n\n03:32.520 --> 03:34.840\n and this I call the real world.\n\n03:35.800 --> 03:39.120\n So you said science, but even bigger than science, what?\n\n03:39.120 --> 03:40.120\n Sure, sure.\n\n03:40.120 --> 03:42.400\n I need not have said this is science.\n\n03:42.400 --> 03:44.840\n I just was warming up.\n\n03:44.840 --> 03:46.480\n Warming up?\n\n03:46.480 --> 03:47.800\n Okay, now that we're warmed up,\n\n03:47.800 --> 03:51.040\n let's take a brief step outside of science.\n\n03:51.040 --> 03:54.400\n Is it completely a crazy idea to you\n\n03:54.400 --> 03:57.480\n that everything that exists is merely a creation\n\n03:57.480 --> 03:58.800\n of our mind?\n\n03:58.800 --> 04:01.880\n So there's a few, not many.\n\n04:01.880 --> 04:04.200\n This is outside of science now.\n\n04:04.200 --> 04:06.520\n People who believe sort of perception\n\n04:06.520 --> 04:10.000\n is fundamentally what's in our human perception,\n\n04:10.000 --> 04:11.720\n the visual cortex and so on,\n\n04:11.720 --> 04:16.240\n the cognitive constructs that's being formed there\n\n04:16.240 --> 04:18.040\n is the reality.\n\n04:18.040 --> 04:20.320\n And then anything outside is something\n\n04:20.320 --> 04:22.480\n that we can never really grasp.\n\n04:22.480 --> 04:24.080\n Is that a crazy idea to you?\n\n04:24.080 --> 04:27.760\n There's a version of that that is not crazy at all.\n\n04:27.760 --> 04:32.360\n What we experience is constructed by our brains\n\n04:33.200 --> 04:36.200\n and by our brains in an active mode.\n\n04:38.080 --> 04:41.920\n So we don't see the raw world.\n\n04:41.920 --> 04:43.800\n We see a very processed world.\n\n04:43.800 --> 04:47.480\n We feel something that's very processed through our brains\n\n04:47.480 --> 04:49.160\n and our brains are incredible.\n\n04:50.120 --> 04:55.120\n But I still believe that behind that experience,\n\n04:55.720 --> 04:59.400\n that mirror or veil or whatever you wanna call it,\n\n04:59.400 --> 05:02.520\n there is a real world and I'm curious about it.\n\n05:02.520 --> 05:06.720\n Can we truly, how do we get a sense of that real world?\n\n05:06.720 --> 05:08.600\n Is it through the tools of physics,\n\n05:08.600 --> 05:11.400\n from theory to the experiments?\n\n05:11.400 --> 05:15.320\n Or can we actually grasp it in some intuitive way\n\n05:15.320 --> 05:20.320\n that's more connected to our ape ancestors?\n\n05:21.240 --> 05:25.160\n Or is it still fundamentally the tools of math and physics\n\n05:25.160 --> 05:26.440\n that really allow us to grasp it?\n\n05:26.440 --> 05:29.040\n Well, let's talk about what tools they are.\n\n05:29.040 --> 05:32.040\n What you say are the tools of math and physics.\n\n05:32.040 --> 05:34.480\n I mean, I think we're in the same position\n\n05:34.480 --> 05:37.880\n as our ancestors in the caves\n\n05:37.880 --> 05:40.160\n or before the caves or whatever.\n\n05:40.160 --> 05:43.320\n We find ourselves in this world and we're curious.\n\n05:43.320 --> 05:47.920\n We also, it's important to be able to explain\n\n05:47.920 --> 05:50.800\n what happens when there are fires, when there are not fires,\n\n05:50.800 --> 05:55.000\n what animals and plants are good to eat and all that stuff.\n\n05:56.360 --> 05:57.640\n But we're also just curious.\n\n05:57.640 --> 06:01.480\n We look up in the sky and we see the sun and the moon\n\n06:01.480 --> 06:03.960\n and the stars and we see some of those move\n\n06:03.960 --> 06:07.160\n and we're very curious about that.\n\n06:07.160 --> 06:10.840\n And I think we're just naturally curious.\n\n06:10.840 --> 06:15.840\n So we make, this is my version of how we work.\n\n06:16.120 --> 06:19.040\n We make up stories and explanations.\n\n06:20.240 --> 06:24.080\n And where there are two things\n\n06:24.080 --> 06:27.560\n which I think are just true of being human,\n\n06:27.560 --> 06:31.040\n we make judgments fast because we have to.\n\n06:31.040 --> 06:36.040\n Where to survive, is that a tiger or is that not a tiger?\n\n06:36.040 --> 06:37.400\n And we go.\n\n06:37.400 --> 06:38.400\n Act.\n\n06:38.400 --> 06:41.120\n We have to act fast on incomplete information.\n\n06:41.120 --> 06:46.000\n So we judge quickly and we're often wrong\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:49.120\n or at least sometimes wrong, which is all I need for this.\n\n06:49.120 --> 06:50.520\n We're often wrong.\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:55.520\n So we fool ourselves and we fool other people readily.\n\n06:56.880 --> 06:59.880\n And so there's lots of stories that get told\n\n06:59.880 --> 07:04.280\n and some of them result in a concrete benefit\n\n07:04.280 --> 07:06.880\n and some of them don't.\n\n07:06.880 --> 07:09.360\n So you said we're often wrong,\n\n07:09.360 --> 07:12.440\n but what does it mean to be right?\n\n07:12.440 --> 07:15.960\n Right, that's an excellent question.\n\n07:15.960 --> 07:20.960\n To be right, well since I believe that there is a real world,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:26.280\n I believe that to be, you can challenge me on this\n\n07:26.280 --> 07:27.480\n if you're not a realist.\n\n07:27.480 --> 07:28.960\n A realist is somebody who believes\n\n07:28.960 --> 07:31.240\n in this real objective world\n\n07:31.240 --> 07:33.040\n which is independent of our perception.\n\n07:33.040 --> 07:37.640\n If I'm a realist, I think that to be right\n\n07:38.680 --> 07:40.200\n is to come closer.\n\n07:40.200 --> 07:42.200\n I think first of all, there's a relative scale.\n\n07:42.200 --> 07:43.480\n There's not right and wrong.\n\n07:43.480 --> 07:46.920\n There's right or more right and less right.\n\n07:46.920 --> 07:49.080\n And you're more right if you come closer\n\n07:49.080 --> 07:53.040\n to an exact true description of that real world.\n\n07:53.040 --> 07:54.800\n Now can we know that for sure?\n\n07:54.800 --> 07:56.040\n No.\n\n07:56.040 --> 07:58.880\n And the scientific method is ultimately\n\n07:58.880 --> 08:00.640\n what allows us to get a sense\n\n08:00.640 --> 08:03.000\n of how close we're getting to that real world?\n\n08:03.000 --> 08:04.120\n No on two counts.\n\n08:04.120 --> 08:06.920\n First of all, I don't believe there's a scientific method.\n\n08:08.200 --> 08:10.680\n I was very influenced when I was in graduate school\n\n08:10.680 --> 08:12.760\n by the writings of Paul Fireman\n\n08:12.760 --> 08:15.720\n who was an important philosopher of science\n\n08:15.720 --> 08:18.280\n who argued that there isn't a scientific method.\n\n08:18.280 --> 08:19.840\n There is or there is not?\n\n08:19.840 --> 08:20.920\n There is not.\n\n08:20.920 --> 08:23.760\n Can you elaborate, I'm sorry if you were going to,\n\n08:23.760 --> 08:27.040\n but can you elaborate on what does it mean\n\n08:27.040 --> 08:28.800\n for there not to be a scientific method,\n\n08:28.800 --> 08:33.080\n this notion that I think a lot of people believe in\n\n08:33.080 --> 08:34.840\n in this day and age?\n\n08:34.840 --> 08:36.080\n Sure.\n\n08:36.080 --> 08:39.760\n Paul Fireman, he was a student of Popper\n\n08:39.760 --> 08:42.320\n who taught Karl Popper.\n\n08:42.320 --> 08:47.320\n And Fireman argued both by logic\n\n08:48.400 --> 08:51.400\n and by historical example that you name anything\n\n08:51.400 --> 08:55.040\n that should be part of the practice of science.\n\n08:55.040 --> 08:57.440\n Say you should always make sure that your theories agree\n\n08:57.440 --> 09:01.200\n with all the data that's already been taken.\n\n09:01.200 --> 09:03.600\n And he'll prove to you that there have to be times\n\n09:03.600 --> 09:08.120\n when science contradicts, when some scientist contradicts\n\n09:08.120 --> 09:13.120\n that advice for science to progress overall.\n\n09:16.880 --> 09:18.240\n So it's not a simple matter.\n\n09:18.240 --> 09:23.240\n I think that, I think of science as a community.\n\n09:25.200 --> 09:26.160\n Of people.\n\n09:26.160 --> 09:29.120\n Of people and as a community of people\n\n09:29.120 --> 09:33.080\n bound by certain ethical precepts,\n\n09:33.080 --> 09:35.000\n precepts, whatever that is.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:40.000\n So in that community, a set of ideas they operate under,\n\n09:40.520 --> 09:44.360\n meaning ethically of kind of the rules of the game\n\n09:44.360 --> 09:45.460\n they operate under.\n\n09:45.460 --> 09:48.000\n Don't lie, report all your results,\n\n09:48.000 --> 09:51.000\n whether they agree or don't agree with your hypothesis.\n\n09:52.920 --> 09:56.000\n Check the training of a scientist.\n\n09:56.000 --> 09:59.320\n Mostly consists of methods of checking\n\n09:59.320 --> 10:01.460\n because again, we make lots of mistakes.\n\n10:01.460 --> 10:03.680\n We're very error prone.\n\n10:03.680 --> 10:06.680\n But there are tools both on the mathematics side\n\n10:06.680 --> 10:09.380\n and the experimental side to check and double check\n\n10:09.380 --> 10:11.000\n and triple check.\n\n10:11.000 --> 10:14.400\n And a scientist goes through a training\n\n10:14.400 --> 10:16.400\n and I think this is part of it.\n\n10:16.400 --> 10:18.280\n You can't just walk off the street and say,\n\n10:18.280 --> 10:20.640\n yo, I'm a scientist.\n\n10:20.640 --> 10:22.280\n You have to go through the training\n\n10:22.280 --> 10:27.280\n and the training, the test that lets you be done\n\n10:27.560 --> 10:32.560\n with the training is can you form a convincing case\n\n10:33.360 --> 10:37.800\n for something that your colleagues\n\n10:37.800 --> 10:40.560\n will not be able to shout down\n\n10:40.560 --> 10:42.520\n because they'll ask, did you check this?\n\n10:42.520 --> 10:43.400\n And did you check that?\n\n10:43.400 --> 10:44.240\n And did you check this?\n\n10:44.240 --> 10:47.720\n And what about seeming contradiction with this?\n\n10:47.720 --> 10:52.240\n And you've got to have answers to all those things\n\n10:52.240 --> 10:53.800\n or you don't get taken seriously.\n\n10:53.800 --> 10:56.560\n And when you get to the point where you can produce\n\n10:56.560 --> 10:58.960\n that kind of defense and argument,\n\n10:58.960 --> 11:00.500\n then they give you a PhD.\n\n11:02.220 --> 11:03.920\n And you're kind of licensed.\n\n11:03.920 --> 11:06.000\n You're still gonna be questioned\n\n11:06.000 --> 11:10.640\n and you still may propose or publish mistakes.\n\n11:10.640 --> 11:14.480\n But the community is gonna have to waste less time\n\n11:14.480 --> 11:15.840\n fixing your mistakes.\n\n11:15.840 --> 11:20.240\n Yes, but if you can maybe linger on it a little longer,\n\n11:20.240 --> 11:25.240\n what's the gap between the thing that that community does\n\n11:25.240 --> 11:27.640\n and the ideal of the scientific method?\n\n11:28.800 --> 11:31.840\n The scientific method is you should be able\n\n11:31.840 --> 11:33.840\n to repeat and experiment.\n\n11:36.320 --> 11:39.400\n There's a lot of elements to what construes\n\n11:39.400 --> 11:41.960\n the scientific method, but the final result,\n\n11:41.960 --> 11:46.720\n the hope of it is that you should be able to say\n\n11:46.720 --> 11:50.160\n with some confidence that a particular thing\n\n11:50.160 --> 11:53.040\n is close to the truth.\n\n11:53.040 --> 11:55.440\n Right, but there's not a simple relationship\n\n11:55.440 --> 11:58.600\n between experiment and hypothesis or theory.\n\n11:58.600 --> 12:01.120\n For example, Galileo did this experiment\n\n12:01.120 --> 12:04.440\n of dropping a ball from the top of a tower\n\n12:04.440 --> 12:06.880\n and it falls right at the base of the tower.\n\n12:07.760 --> 12:10.480\n And an Aristotelian would say, wow,\n\n12:10.480 --> 12:12.760\n of course it falls right to the base of the tower.\n\n12:12.760 --> 12:14.400\n That shows that the earth isn't moving\n\n12:14.400 --> 12:16.720\n while the ball is falling.\n\n12:16.720 --> 12:19.760\n And Galileo says, no way, there's a principle of inertia\n\n12:19.760 --> 12:22.280\n and it has an inertia in the direction\n\n12:22.280 --> 12:24.360\n where the earth isn't moving and the tower\n\n12:24.360 --> 12:26.840\n and the ball and the earth all move together.\n\n12:26.840 --> 12:30.080\n When the principle of inertia tells you it hits the bottom,\n\n12:30.080 --> 12:33.000\n it does look, therefore my principle of inertia is right.\n\n12:33.000 --> 12:37.280\n And Aristotelian says, no, our style of science is right.\n\n12:37.280 --> 12:39.400\n The earth is stationary.\n\n12:39.400 --> 12:44.400\n And so you gotta get an interconnected bunch of cases\n\n12:45.600 --> 12:49.200\n and work hard to line up and explain.\n\n12:49.200 --> 12:51.840\n It took centuries to make the transition\n\n12:51.840 --> 12:55.880\n from Aristotelian physics to the new physics.\n\n12:55.880 --> 13:00.880\n It wasn't done until Newton in 1680 something, 1687.\n\n13:02.000 --> 13:04.960\n So what do you think is the nature of the process\n\n13:04.960 --> 13:07.960\n that seems to lead to progress?\n\n13:07.960 --> 13:11.120\n If we at least look at the long arc of science,\n\n13:11.120 --> 13:13.360\n of all the community of scientists,\n\n13:13.360 --> 13:16.960\n they seem to do a better job of coming up with ideas\n\n13:16.960 --> 13:21.120\n that engineers can then take on and build rockets with\n\n13:21.120 --> 13:26.120\n or build computers with or build cool stuff with.\n\n13:26.400 --> 13:28.600\n I don't know, a better job than what?\n\n13:30.200 --> 13:32.480\n Than this previous century.\n\n13:32.480 --> 13:35.800\n So century by century, we'll talk about string theory\n\n13:35.800 --> 13:38.040\n and so on and kind of possible,\n\n13:38.040 --> 13:41.040\n what you might think of as dead ends and so on.\n\n13:41.040 --> 13:42.680\n Which is not the way I think of string theory.\n\n13:42.680 --> 13:45.840\n We'll straighten out, we'll get all the strings straight.\n\n13:45.840 --> 13:49.640\n But there is, nevertheless in science, very often,\n\n13:49.640 --> 13:52.040\n at least temporary dead ends.\n\n13:52.040 --> 13:57.040\n But if you look at the, through centuries,\n\n13:57.760 --> 14:01.120\n the century before Newton and the century after Newton,\n\n14:01.120 --> 14:06.120\n it seems like a lot of ideas came closer to the truth\n\n14:07.080 --> 14:10.280\n that then could be usable by our civilization\n\n14:10.280 --> 14:12.940\n to build the iPhone, right?\n\n14:12.940 --> 14:15.900\n To build cool things that improve our quality of life.\n\n14:15.900 --> 14:18.480\n That's the progress I'm kind of referring to.\n\n14:19.400 --> 14:21.440\n Let me, can I say that more precisely?\n\n14:21.440 --> 14:23.840\n Yes, well, it's a low bar.\n\n14:23.840 --> 14:28.840\n Because I think it's important to get the time places right.\n\n14:28.840 --> 14:33.840\n There was a scientific revolution that partly succeeded\n\n14:34.640 --> 14:39.520\n between about 1900 or late 1890s\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:44.520\n and into the 1930s, 1940s and so.\n\n14:45.440 --> 14:50.280\n And maybe some, if you stretched it, into the 1970s.\n\n14:50.280 --> 14:54.520\n And the technology, this was the discovery of relativity\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:58.320\n and that included a lot of developments of electromagnetism.\n\n14:58.320 --> 15:02.600\n The confirmation, which wasn't really well confirmed\n\n15:02.600 --> 15:06.560\n into the 20th century, that matter was made of atoms.\n\n15:06.560 --> 15:09.880\n And the whole picture of nuclei with electrons going around,\n\n15:09.880 --> 15:12.520\n this is early 20th century.\n\n15:12.520 --> 15:17.520\n And then quantum mechanics was from 1905,\n\n15:17.840 --> 15:21.760\n took a long time to develop, to the late 1920s.\n\n15:21.760 --> 15:25.280\n And then it was basically in final form.\n\n15:25.280 --> 15:29.440\n And the basis of this partial revolution,\n\n15:29.440 --> 15:32.280\n and we can come back to why it's only a partial revolution,\n\n15:33.440 --> 15:36.240\n is the basis of the technologies that you mentioned.\n\n15:37.040 --> 15:40.840\n All of, I mean, electrical technology\n\n15:40.840 --> 15:42.880\n was being developed slowly with this.\n\n15:42.880 --> 15:46.000\n And in fact, there's a close relation\n\n15:46.000 --> 15:49.560\n between the development of electricity\n\n15:49.560 --> 15:54.120\n and the electrification of cities in the United States\n\n15:54.120 --> 15:55.640\n and Europe and so forth.\n\n15:56.600 --> 15:59.280\n And the development of the science.\n\n16:00.800 --> 16:05.800\n The fundamental physics since the early 1970s\n\n16:08.520 --> 16:11.200\n doesn't have a story like that so far.\n\n16:11.200 --> 16:16.200\n There's not a series of triumphs and progresses\n\n16:16.560 --> 16:19.760\n and there's not any practical application.\n\n16:19.760 --> 16:24.760\n So just to linger briefly on the early 20th century\n\n16:26.520 --> 16:29.000\n and the revolutions in science that happened there,\n\n16:30.320 --> 16:33.960\n what was the method by which the scientific community\n\n16:33.960 --> 16:38.960\n kept each other in check about when you get something right,\n\n16:39.040 --> 16:40.120\n when you get something wrong?\n\n16:40.120 --> 16:43.600\n Is experimental validation ultimately the final test?\n\n16:43.600 --> 16:45.320\n It's absolutely necessary.\n\n16:45.320 --> 16:47.600\n And the key things were all validated.\n\n16:47.600 --> 16:50.920\n The key predictions of quantum mechanics\n\n16:50.920 --> 16:53.280\n and of the theory of electricity and magnetism.\n\n16:54.360 --> 16:57.800\n So before we talk about Einstein, your new book,\n\n16:57.800 --> 17:00.720\n before String Theory, Quantum Mechanics, so on,\n\n17:00.720 --> 17:04.040\n let's take a step back at a higher level question.\n\n17:04.040 --> 17:06.880\n What is that you mentioned?\n\n17:06.880 --> 17:08.360\n What is realism?\n\n17:08.360 --> 17:10.600\n What is anti realism?\n\n17:11.600 --> 17:13.840\n And maybe why do you find realism,\n\n17:13.840 --> 17:15.680\n as you mentioned, so compelling?\n\n17:15.680 --> 17:20.680\n Well, realism is the belief in an external world\n\n17:26.000 --> 17:28.680\n independent of our existence, our perception,\n\n17:28.680 --> 17:30.720\n our belief, our knowledge.\n\n17:30.720 --> 17:35.520\n A realist as a physicist is somebody who believes\n\n17:35.520 --> 17:40.520\n that there should be possible some completely objective\n\n17:40.640 --> 17:44.760\n description of each and every process\n\n17:44.760 --> 17:49.400\n at the fundamental level, which describes and explains\n\n17:49.400 --> 17:52.800\n exactly what happens and why it happens.\n\n17:52.800 --> 17:55.680\n That kind of implies that that system,\n\n17:55.680 --> 17:58.280\n in a realist view, is deterministic,\n\n17:58.280 --> 18:01.120\n meaning there's no fuzzy magic going on\n\n18:01.120 --> 18:02.280\n that you can never get to the bottom,\n\n18:02.280 --> 18:04.280\n or you can get to the bottom of anything\n\n18:04.280 --> 18:06.240\n and perfectly describe it.\n\n18:07.640 --> 18:10.720\n Some people would say that I'm not that interested\n\n18:10.720 --> 18:15.560\n in determinism, but I could live with the fundamental world,\n\n18:15.560 --> 18:18.560\n which had some chance in it.\n\n18:18.560 --> 18:21.760\n So do you, you said you could live with it,\n\n18:21.760 --> 18:26.520\n but do you think God plays dice in our universe?\n\n18:26.520 --> 18:28.720\n I think it's probably much worse than that.\n\n18:30.360 --> 18:32.080\n In which direction?\n\n18:32.080 --> 18:33.920\n I think that theories can change,\n\n18:33.920 --> 18:36.120\n and theories can change without warning.\n\n18:36.120 --> 18:38.520\n I think the future is open.\n\n18:38.520 --> 18:40.920\n You mean the fundamental laws of physics can change?\n\n18:40.920 --> 18:42.440\n Yeah.\n\n18:42.440 --> 18:43.800\n Oh, okay, we'll get there.\n\n18:43.800 --> 18:48.800\n I thought we would be able to find some solid ground,\n\n18:49.720 --> 18:54.720\n but apparently the entirety of it, temporarily so, probably.\n\n18:55.160 --> 19:00.160\n Okay, so realism is the idea that while the ground\n\n19:00.760 --> 19:02.920\n is solid, you can describe it.\n\n19:02.920 --> 19:04.680\n What's the role of the human being,\n\n19:04.680 --> 19:09.680\n our beautiful, complex human mind in realism?\n\n19:10.480 --> 19:14.760\n Do we have a, are we just another set of molecules\n\n19:14.760 --> 19:16.480\n connected together in a clever way,\n\n19:16.480 --> 19:21.480\n or the observer, does the observer, our human mind,\n\n19:22.120 --> 19:24.760\n consciousness, have a role in this realism view\n\n19:24.760 --> 19:26.360\n of the physical universe?\n\n19:27.200 --> 19:30.400\n There's two ways, there's two questions you could be asking.\n\n19:30.400 --> 19:35.400\n One, does our conscious mind, do our perceptions\n\n19:35.680 --> 19:38.800\n play a role in making things become,\n\n19:38.800 --> 19:42.280\n in making things real or things becoming?\n\n19:42.280 --> 19:43.320\n That's question one.\n\n19:43.320 --> 19:47.400\n Question two is, does this, we can call it\n\n19:47.400 --> 19:52.400\n a naturalist view of the world that is based on realism,\n\n19:54.720 --> 19:58.080\n allow a place to understand the existence of\n\n19:58.080 --> 20:01.760\n and the nature of perceptions and consciousness in mind,\n\n20:01.760 --> 20:03.240\n and that's question two.\n\n20:04.080 --> 20:06.640\n Question two, I do think a lot about,\n\n20:06.640 --> 20:11.120\n and my answer, which is not an answer, is I hope so,\n\n20:11.120 --> 20:12.680\n but it certainly doesn't yet.\n\n20:14.000 --> 20:14.840\n So what kind?\n\n20:14.840 --> 20:17.000\n Question one, I don't think so.\n\n20:17.000 --> 20:18.720\n But of course, the answer to question one\n\n20:18.720 --> 20:20.120\n depends on question two.\n\n20:20.120 --> 20:21.760\n Right.\n\n20:21.760 --> 20:24.040\n So I'm not up to question one yet.\n\n20:24.040 --> 20:26.160\n So question two is the thing that you can kind of\n\n20:26.160 --> 20:27.720\n struggle with at this time.\n\n20:27.720 --> 20:28.560\n Yes.\n\n20:28.560 --> 20:32.120\n That's, what about the anti realists?\n\n20:32.120 --> 20:36.280\n So what flavor, what are the different camps\n\n20:36.280 --> 20:38.440\n of anti realists that you've talked about?\n\n20:38.440 --> 20:41.000\n I think it would be nice if you can articulate\n\n20:42.480 --> 20:44.160\n for the people for whom there is not\n\n20:44.160 --> 20:47.520\n a very concrete real world, or there's divisions,\n\n20:47.520 --> 20:52.280\n or it's messier than the realist view of the universe,\n\n20:52.280 --> 20:54.680\n what are the different camps, what are the different views?\n\n20:54.680 --> 20:58.160\n I'm not sure I'm a good scholar and can talk about\n\n20:58.160 --> 20:59.960\n the different camps and analyze it,\n\n20:59.960 --> 21:04.560\n but some, many of the inventors of quantum physics\n\n21:04.560 --> 21:07.600\n were not realists, were anti realists.\n\n21:07.600 --> 21:11.000\n Their scholars, they lived in a very perilous time\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.840\n between the two world wars.\n\n21:13.800 --> 21:17.480\n And there were a lot of trends in culture\n\n21:17.480 --> 21:19.240\n which were going that way.\n\n21:19.240 --> 21:21.960\n But in any case, they said things like,\n\n21:21.960 --> 21:26.960\n the purpose of science is not to give an objective\n\n21:27.360 --> 21:29.360\n realist description of nature as it would be\n\n21:29.360 --> 21:30.680\n in our absence.\n\n21:30.680 --> 21:33.040\n This might be saying Niels Bohr.\n\n21:33.040 --> 21:36.320\n The purpose of science is as an extension\n\n21:36.320 --> 21:38.760\n of our conversations with each other\n\n21:38.760 --> 21:41.280\n to describe our interactions with nature.\n\n21:41.280 --> 21:44.640\n And we're free to invent and use terms like\n\n21:44.640 --> 21:48.760\n particle, or wave, or causality, or time, or space.\n\n21:48.760 --> 21:53.760\n If they're useful to us, and they carry some\n\n21:53.960 --> 21:58.000\n intuitive implication, but we shouldn't believe\n\n21:58.000 --> 22:00.280\n that they actually have to do with what nature\n\n22:00.280 --> 22:02.520\n would be like in our absence,\n\n22:02.520 --> 22:04.600\n which we have nothing to say about.\n\n22:05.440 --> 22:08.120\n Do you find any aspect of that,\n\n22:08.120 --> 22:10.400\n because you kind of said that we human beings\n\n22:10.400 --> 22:13.920\n tell stories, do you find aspects of that\n\n22:13.920 --> 22:18.800\n kind of anti realist view of Niels Bohr compelling?\n\n22:18.800 --> 22:20.960\n That we fundamentally are storytellers,\n\n22:20.960 --> 22:24.520\n and then we create tools of space, and time,\n\n22:24.520 --> 22:28.520\n and causality, and whatever this fun quantum\n\n22:28.520 --> 22:32.800\n mechanic stuff is to help us tell the story of our world.\n\n22:32.800 --> 22:35.560\n Sure, I just would like to believe that there's\n\n22:35.560 --> 22:38.480\n an aspiration for the other thing.\n\n22:39.680 --> 22:41.400\n The other thing being what?\n\n22:41.400 --> 22:44.000\n The realist point of view.\n\n22:44.000 --> 22:47.320\n Do you hope that the stories will eventually lead us\n\n22:47.320 --> 22:52.320\n to discovering the real world as it is?\n\n22:56.560 --> 22:57.560\n Yeah.\n\n22:57.560 --> 22:59.200\n Is perfection possible, by the way?\n\n22:59.200 --> 23:00.680\n Is it? No.\n\n23:00.680 --> 23:03.880\n Well that's, you mean will we ever get there\n\n23:03.880 --> 23:05.200\n and know that we're there?\n\n23:05.200 --> 23:06.480\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n23:06.480 --> 23:09.800\n That's not my, that's for people 5,000 years in the future.\n\n23:09.800 --> 23:11.760\n We're certainly nowhere near there yet.\n\n23:14.240 --> 23:19.240\n Do you think reality that exists outside of our mind,\n\n23:20.720 --> 23:24.680\n do you think there's a limit to our cognitive abilities?\n\n23:24.680 --> 23:26.840\n Is, again, descendants of apes,\n\n23:26.840 --> 23:28.840\n who are just biological systems,\n\n23:28.840 --> 23:31.800\n is there a limit to our mind's capability\n\n23:31.800 --> 23:34.780\n to actually understand reality?\n\n23:35.880 --> 23:39.200\n Sort of, there comes a point,\n\n23:39.200 --> 23:42.360\n even with the help of the tools of physics,\n\n23:42.360 --> 23:46.440\n that we just cannot grasp some fundamental aspects\n\n23:46.440 --> 23:47.280\n of that reality.\n\n23:47.280 --> 23:48.240\n Again, I think that's a question\n\n23:48.240 --> 23:49.840\n for 5,000 years in the future.\n\n23:49.840 --> 23:51.160\n We're not even close to that limit.\n\n23:51.160 --> 23:54.240\n I think there is a universality.\n\n23:54.240 --> 23:56.920\n Here, I don't agree with David Deutsch about everything,\n\n23:56.920 --> 24:01.280\n but I admire the way he put things in his last book.\n\n24:01.280 --> 24:04.600\n And he talked about the role of explanation.\n\n24:04.600 --> 24:08.880\n And he talked about the universality of certain languages\n\n24:08.880 --> 24:11.040\n or the universality of mathematics\n\n24:11.040 --> 24:15.760\n or of computing and so forth.\n\n24:15.760 --> 24:18.400\n And he believed that universality,\n\n24:18.400 --> 24:19.360\n which is something real,\n\n24:19.360 --> 24:22.880\n which somehow comes out of the fact\n\n24:22.880 --> 24:26.160\n that a symbolic system or a mathematical system\n\n24:26.160 --> 24:29.040\n can refer to itself and can,\n\n24:29.040 --> 24:30.160\n I forget what that's called,\n\n24:30.160 --> 24:34.360\n can reference back to itself and build,\n\n24:34.360 --> 24:38.320\n in which he argued for a universality of possibility\n\n24:38.320 --> 24:41.360\n for our understanding, whatever is out there.\n\n24:41.360 --> 24:45.280\n But I admire that argument,\n\n24:45.280 --> 24:50.280\n but it seems to me we're doing okay so far,\n\n24:51.040 --> 24:53.840\n but we'll have to see.\n\n24:53.840 --> 24:55.160\n Whether there is a limit or not.\n\n24:55.160 --> 24:57.240\n For now, we've got plenty to play with.\n\n24:57.240 --> 24:58.320\n Yeah.\n\n24:58.320 --> 25:01.760\n There are things which are right there in front of us\n\n25:01.760 --> 25:03.640\n which we miss.\n\n25:03.640 --> 25:06.840\n And I'll quote my friend, Eric Weinstein,\n\n25:06.840 --> 25:10.520\n in saying, look, Einstein carried his luggage.\n\n25:10.520 --> 25:12.040\n Freud carried his luggage.\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:13.400\n Marx carried his luggage.\n\n25:13.400 --> 25:17.000\n Martha Graham carried her luggage, et cetera.\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.240\n Edison carried his luggage.\n\n25:19.240 --> 25:22.000\n All these geniuses carried their luggage.\n\n25:22.000 --> 25:25.640\n And not once before relatively recently\n\n25:25.640 --> 25:28.160\n did it occur to anybody to put a wheel on luggage\n\n25:28.160 --> 25:29.000\n and pull it.\n\n25:29.000 --> 25:33.040\n And it was right there waiting to be invented\n\n25:33.040 --> 25:34.600\n for centuries.\n\n25:34.600 --> 25:37.960\n So this is Eric Weinstein.\n\n25:37.960 --> 25:39.040\n Yeah.\n\n25:39.040 --> 25:40.520\n What do the wheels represent?\n\n25:40.520 --> 25:42.200\n Are you basically saying that there's stuff\n\n25:42.200 --> 25:43.760\n right in front of our eyes?\n\n25:43.760 --> 25:46.200\n That once we, it just clicks,\n\n25:46.200 --> 25:48.240\n we put the wheels on the luggage,\n\n25:48.240 --> 25:49.880\n a lot of things will fall into place.\n\n25:49.880 --> 25:52.440\n Yes, I do, I do.\n\n25:52.440 --> 25:55.120\n And every day I wake up and think,\n\n25:55.120 --> 25:58.560\n why can't I be that guy who was walking through the airport?\n\n26:00.760 --> 26:02.840\n What do you think it takes to be that guy?\n\n26:02.840 --> 26:05.760\n Because like you said,\n\n26:05.760 --> 26:08.560\n a lot of really smart people carried their luggage.\n\n26:10.040 --> 26:12.440\n What, just psychologically speaking,\n\n26:12.440 --> 26:14.560\n so Eric Weinstein is a good example of a person\n\n26:14.560 --> 26:16.120\n who thinks outside the box.\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:16.960\n Yes.\n\n26:16.960 --> 26:21.040\n Who resists almost conventional thinking.\n\n26:21.040 --> 26:25.480\n You're an example of a person who by habit,\n\n26:25.480 --> 26:28.880\n by psychology, by upbringing, I don't know,\n\n26:28.880 --> 26:31.160\n but resists conventional thinking as well,\n\n26:31.160 --> 26:32.000\n just by nature.\n\n26:32.000 --> 26:32.920\n Thank you, that's a compliment.\n\n26:32.920 --> 26:34.080\n That's a compliment?\n\n26:34.080 --> 26:34.920\n Good.\n\n26:34.920 --> 26:37.240\n So what do you think it takes to do that?\n\n26:37.240 --> 26:39.280\n Is that something you were just born with?\n\n26:40.880 --> 26:42.040\n I doubt it.\n\n26:42.040 --> 26:47.040\n Well, from my studying some cases,\n\n26:47.040 --> 26:49.840\n because I'm curious about that, obviously,\n\n26:49.840 --> 26:52.520\n and just in a more concrete way,\n\n26:52.520 --> 26:54.400\n when I started out in physics,\n\n26:54.400 --> 26:57.880\n because I started a long way from physics,\n\n26:57.880 --> 27:00.800\n so it took me a long, not a long time,\n\n27:00.800 --> 27:04.280\n but a lot of work to get to study it and get into it,\n\n27:04.280 --> 27:05.880\n so I did wonder about that.\n\n27:07.040 --> 27:10.400\n And so I read the biographies,\n\n27:10.400 --> 27:12.960\n and in fact, I started with the autobiography of Einstein\n\n27:12.960 --> 27:17.960\n and Newton and Galileo and all those people.\n\n27:18.520 --> 27:22.760\n And I think there's a couple of things.\n\n27:22.760 --> 27:24.920\n Some of it is luck, being in the right place\n\n27:24.920 --> 27:26.320\n at the right time.\n\n27:26.320 --> 27:28.800\n Some of it is stubbornness and arrogance,\n\n27:28.800 --> 27:30.440\n which can easily go wrong.\n\n27:30.440 --> 27:31.960\n Yes.\n\n27:31.960 --> 27:36.280\n And I know all of these are doorways.\n\n27:36.280 --> 27:38.960\n If you go through them slightly at the wrong speed\n\n27:38.960 --> 27:43.960\n or in the wrong angle, they're ways to fail.\n\n27:45.000 --> 27:47.640\n But if you somehow have the right luck,\n\n27:47.640 --> 27:52.040\n the right confidence or arrogance, caring,\n\n27:52.040 --> 27:56.000\n I think Einstein cared to understand nature\n\n27:56.000 --> 28:00.960\n with ferocity and a commitment that exceeded\n\n28:00.960 --> 28:02.240\n other people of his time.\n\n28:02.240 --> 28:05.080\n So he asked more stubborn questions.\n\n28:05.080 --> 28:08.120\n He asked deeper questions.\n\n28:09.960 --> 28:14.960\n I think, and there's a level of ability\n\n28:15.000 --> 28:20.000\n and whether ability is born in or can be developed\n\n28:20.120 --> 28:21.720\n to the extent to which it can be developed,\n\n28:21.720 --> 28:24.480\n like any of these things like musical talent.\n\n28:24.480 --> 28:27.040\n So you mentioned ego.\n\n28:27.040 --> 28:29.000\n What's the role of ego in that process?\n\n28:29.000 --> 28:30.040\n Confidence.\n\n28:30.040 --> 28:30.880\n Confidence.\n\n28:30.880 --> 28:34.680\n But in your own life, have you found yourself\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:38.920\n walking that nice edge of too much or too little,\n\n28:38.920 --> 28:41.000\n so being overconfident and therefore\n\n28:41.000 --> 28:43.960\n leaning yourself astray or not sufficiently confident\n\n28:43.960 --> 28:47.000\n to throw away the conventional thinking\n\n28:47.000 --> 28:50.540\n of whatever the theory of the day, of theoretical physics?\n\n28:51.480 --> 28:54.240\n I don't know if I, I mean, I've contributed\n\n28:54.240 --> 28:57.360\n where I've contributed, whether if I had had\n\n28:57.360 --> 29:01.360\n more confidence in something, I would have gotten further.\n\n29:01.360 --> 29:02.200\n I don't know.\n\n29:03.960 --> 29:08.960\n Certainly, I'm sitting here at this moment\n\n29:09.520 --> 29:14.480\n with very much my own approach to nearly everything.\n\n29:14.480 --> 29:17.800\n And I'm calm, I'm happy about that.\n\n29:18.800 --> 29:20.840\n But on the other hand, I know people\n\n29:20.840 --> 29:25.840\n whose self confidence vastly exceeds mine.\n\n29:26.680 --> 29:28.560\n And sometimes I think it's justified\n\n29:28.560 --> 29:31.700\n and sometimes I think it's not justified.\n\n29:33.040 --> 29:35.280\n Your most recent book titled\n\n29:35.280 --> 29:37.800\n Einstein's Unfinished Revolution.\n\n29:37.800 --> 29:42.240\n So I have to ask, what is Einstein's unfinished revolution\n\n29:42.240 --> 29:45.480\n and also how do we finish it?\n\n29:45.480 --> 29:48.440\n Well, that's something I've been trying to do my whole life,\n\n29:48.440 --> 29:51.240\n but Einstein's unfinished revolution\n\n29:51.240 --> 29:54.880\n is the twin revolutions which invented relativity theory,\n\n29:54.880 --> 29:58.200\n special and especially general relativity,\n\n29:58.200 --> 30:01.320\n and quantum theory, which he was the first person\n\n30:01.320 --> 30:04.960\n to realize in 1905 that there would have to be\n\n30:04.960 --> 30:09.920\n a radically different theory which somehow realized\n\n30:09.920 --> 30:12.240\n or resolved the paradox of the duality\n\n30:12.240 --> 30:14.360\n of particle and wave for photons.\n\n30:14.360 --> 30:18.720\n And he was, I mean, people I think don't always\n\n30:18.720 --> 30:21.160\n associate Einstein with quantum mechanics\n\n30:21.160 --> 30:23.380\n because I think his connection with it,\n\n30:24.320 --> 30:27.080\n founding as one of the founders,\n\n30:27.080 --> 30:28.440\n I would say, of quantum mechanics,\n\n30:28.440 --> 30:30.480\n he kind of put it in the closet.\n\n30:30.480 --> 30:31.320\n Is it?\n\n30:31.320 --> 30:34.000\n Well, he didn't believe that the quantum mechanics\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:38.160\n as it was developed in the mid to late 1920s\n\n30:38.160 --> 30:39.560\n was completely correct.\n\n30:39.560 --> 30:42.160\n At first, he didn't believe it at all.\n\n30:42.160 --> 30:44.180\n Then he was convinced that it's consistent,\n\n30:44.180 --> 30:47.280\n but incomplete, and that also is my view.\n\n30:47.280 --> 30:52.040\n It needs, for various reasons, I can elucidate,\n\n30:52.040 --> 30:56.960\n to have additional degrees of freedom, particles,\n\n30:56.960 --> 31:00.680\n forces, something to reach the stage\n\n31:00.680 --> 31:03.960\n where it gives a complete description of each phenomenon,\n\n31:03.960 --> 31:07.620\n as I was saying, realism demands.\n\n31:07.620 --> 31:10.320\n So what aspect of quantum mechanics\n\n31:10.320 --> 31:12.920\n bothers you and Einstein the most?\n\n31:12.920 --> 31:17.920\n Is it some aspect of the wave function collapse discussions,\n\n31:18.240 --> 31:19.880\n the measurement problem?\n\n31:19.880 --> 31:23.220\n Is it the?\n\n31:23.220 --> 31:24.120\n The measurement problem.\n\n31:24.120 --> 31:26.160\n I'm not gonna speak for Einstein.\n\n31:26.160 --> 31:31.160\n But the measurement problem, basically, and the fact that.\n\n31:31.880 --> 31:34.120\n What is the measurement problem, sorry?\n\n31:34.120 --> 31:36.840\n The basic formulation of quantum mechanics\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:41.100\n gives you two ways to evolve situations in time.\n\n31:41.100 --> 31:44.920\n One of them is explicitly when no observer is observing\n\n31:44.920 --> 31:47.200\n and no measurement is taking place.\n\n31:47.200 --> 31:48.720\n And the other is when a measurement\n\n31:48.720 --> 31:50.480\n or an observation is taking place.\n\n31:50.480 --> 31:53.960\n And they basically contradict each other.\n\n31:53.960 --> 31:56.720\n But there's another reason why the revolution\n\n31:56.720 --> 31:58.680\n was incomplete, which is we don't understand\n\n31:58.680 --> 32:01.200\n the relationship between these two parts.\n\n32:01.200 --> 32:04.680\n General relativity, which became our best theory\n\n32:04.680 --> 32:08.720\n of space and time and gravitation and cosmology,\n\n32:08.720 --> 32:11.600\n and quantum theory.\n\n32:11.600 --> 32:14.120\n So for the most part, general relativity\n\n32:14.120 --> 32:15.960\n describes big things.\n\n32:15.960 --> 32:18.080\n Quantum theory describes little things.\n\n32:18.080 --> 32:20.360\n And that's the revolution that we found\n\n32:20.360 --> 32:22.520\n really powerful tools to describe\n\n32:22.520 --> 32:24.040\n big things and little things.\n\n32:24.040 --> 32:27.400\n And it's unfinished because we have\n\n32:27.400 --> 32:30.120\n two totally separate things and we need to figure out\n\n32:30.120 --> 32:32.360\n how to connect them so we can describe everything.\n\n32:32.360 --> 32:36.820\n Right, and we either do that if we believe quantum mechanics\n\n32:36.820 --> 32:41.820\n as understood now is correct by bringing general relativity\n\n32:42.120 --> 32:44.160\n or some extension of general relativity\n\n32:44.160 --> 32:46.520\n that describes gravity and so forth\n\n32:46.520 --> 32:49.680\n into the quantum domain that's called quantize,\n\n32:50.640 --> 32:52.960\n the theory of gravity.\n\n32:52.960 --> 32:55.840\n Or if you believe with Einstein\n\n32:55.840 --> 32:58.200\n that quantum mechanics needs to be completed,\n\n32:58.200 --> 33:03.080\n and this is my view, then part of the job\n\n33:03.080 --> 33:04.880\n of finding the right completion\n\n33:04.880 --> 33:07.120\n or extension of quantum mechanics\n\n33:07.120 --> 33:10.360\n would be one that incorporated space, time, and gravity.\n\n33:12.640 --> 33:14.960\n So, where do we begin?\n\n33:14.960 --> 33:19.620\n So first, let me ask, perhaps you can give me a chance,\n\n33:19.620 --> 33:22.100\n if I could ask you some just really basic questions.\n\n33:22.100 --> 33:23.520\n Well, they're not at all.\n\n33:23.520 --> 33:24.880\n The basic questions are the hardest,\n\n33:24.880 --> 33:26.740\n but you mentioned space, time.\n\n33:26.740 --> 33:28.880\n What is space, time?\n\n33:28.880 --> 33:32.260\n Space, time, you talked about a construction.\n\n33:32.260 --> 33:36.440\n So I believe the space, time is an intellectual construction\n\n33:36.440 --> 33:39.200\n that we make of the events in the universe.\n\n33:39.200 --> 33:40.680\n I believe the events are real,\n\n33:40.680 --> 33:43.520\n and the relationships between the events,\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:45.720\n which cause which are real.\n\n33:45.720 --> 33:50.480\n But the idea that there's a four dimensional\n\n33:50.480 --> 33:54.000\n smooth geometry which has a metric and a connection\n\n33:54.000 --> 33:57.320\n and satisfies the equations that Einstein wrote,\n\n33:57.320 --> 34:00.400\n it's a good description to some scale.\n\n34:00.400 --> 34:02.760\n It's a good approximation, it captures some\n\n34:02.760 --> 34:05.080\n of what's really going on in nature.\n\n34:05.080 --> 34:08.600\n But I don't believe it for a minute is fundamental.\n\n34:08.600 --> 34:12.420\n So, okay, we're gonna allow me to linger on that.\n\n34:12.420 --> 34:16.760\n So the universe has events, events cause other events.\n\n34:16.760 --> 34:19.080\n This is the idea of causality.\n\n34:19.080 --> 34:22.080\n Okay, so that's real.\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:23.720\n That's in my.\n\n34:23.720 --> 34:25.520\n In your view is real.\n\n34:25.520 --> 34:29.660\n Or hypothesis, or the theories that I have been working\n\n34:29.660 --> 34:32.200\n to develop make that assumption.\n\n34:32.200 --> 34:35.320\n So space, time, you said four dimensional space\n\n34:35.320 --> 34:37.220\n is kind of the location of things,\n\n34:37.220 --> 34:42.240\n and time is whatever the heck time is.\n\n34:42.240 --> 34:47.240\n And you're saying that space, time is,\n\n34:47.800 --> 34:51.480\n both space and time are emergent and not fundamental?\n\n34:51.480 --> 34:52.320\n No.\n\n34:52.320 --> 34:54.480\n Sorry, before you correct me,\n\n34:55.460 --> 34:58.600\n what does it mean to be fundamental or emergent?\n\n34:58.600 --> 35:01.480\n Fundamental means it's part of the description\n\n35:01.480 --> 35:03.140\n as far down as you go.\n\n35:03.140 --> 35:03.980\n We have this notion.\n\n35:03.980 --> 35:04.800\n As real.\n\n35:04.800 --> 35:05.640\n Yes.\n\n35:05.640 --> 35:07.240\n As real as real it could be.\n\n35:07.240 --> 35:10.160\n Yeah, so I think that time is fundamental,\n\n35:10.160 --> 35:12.440\n and quote goes all the way down,\n\n35:12.440 --> 35:16.080\n and space does not, and the combination of them\n\n35:16.080 --> 35:18.960\n we use in general relativity that we call space time\n\n35:18.960 --> 35:20.800\n also does not.\n\n35:20.800 --> 35:24.080\n But what is time then?\n\n35:24.080 --> 35:29.080\n I think that time, the activity of time\n\n35:29.440 --> 35:34.360\n is a continual creation of events from existing events.\n\n35:34.360 --> 35:37.560\n So if there's no events, there's no time.\n\n35:37.560 --> 35:41.060\n Then there's not only no time, there's no nothing.\n\n35:41.060 --> 35:45.800\n So I believe the universe has a history\n\n35:47.020 --> 35:48.760\n which goes to the past.\n\n35:48.760 --> 35:51.700\n I believe the future does not exist.\n\n35:51.700 --> 35:53.320\n There's a notion of the present\n\n35:53.320 --> 35:55.520\n and a notion of the past,\n\n35:55.520 --> 35:58.720\n and the past consists of,\n\n35:58.720 --> 36:03.640\n is a story about events that took place to our past.\n\n36:03.640 --> 36:05.520\n So you said the future doesn't exist.\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:06.360\n Yes.\n\n36:08.800 --> 36:10.200\n Could you say that again?\n\n36:10.200 --> 36:14.360\n Can you try to give me a chance to understand that\n\n36:14.360 --> 36:15.280\n one more time?\n\n36:15.280 --> 36:18.480\n So events cause other events.\n\n36:18.480 --> 36:19.400\n What is this universe?\n\n36:19.400 --> 36:23.580\n Cause we'll talk about locality and nonlocality.\n\n36:23.580 --> 36:25.120\n Good.\n\n36:25.120 --> 36:27.120\n Cause it's a crazy, I mean it's not crazy,\n\n36:27.120 --> 36:32.120\n it's a beautiful set of ideas that you propose.\n\n36:32.160 --> 36:34.640\n But, and if Kozali is fundamental,\n\n36:34.640 --> 36:37.120\n I'd just like to understand it better.\n\n36:37.120 --> 36:38.920\n What is the past?\n\n36:38.920 --> 36:40.000\n What is the future?\n\n36:40.000 --> 36:41.920\n What is the flow of time?\n\n36:42.760 --> 36:46.680\n Even the error of time in our universe, in your view.\n\n36:46.680 --> 36:50.440\n And maybe what's an event, right?\n\n36:50.440 --> 36:54.360\n Oh, an event is where something changes,\n\n36:54.360 --> 36:58.120\n or where two,\n\n36:59.520 --> 37:02.200\n it's hard to say because it's a primitive concept.\n\n37:02.200 --> 37:07.200\n An event is a moment of time within space.\n\n37:07.960 --> 37:11.480\n This is the view in general relativity,\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:15.480\n where two particles intersect in their paths,\n\n37:15.480 --> 37:19.760\n or something changes in the path of a particle.\n\n37:19.760 --> 37:23.600\n Now, we are postulating that there is,\n\n37:23.600 --> 37:25.600\n at the fundamental level, a notion,\n\n37:25.600 --> 37:27.240\n which is an elementary notion,\n\n37:27.240 --> 37:31.480\n so it doesn't have a definition in terms of other things,\n\n37:31.480 --> 37:34.800\n but it is something elementary happening.\n\n37:34.800 --> 37:36.920\n And it doesn't have a connection to energy,\n\n37:36.920 --> 37:38.240\n or matter, or exchange of energy?\n\n37:38.240 --> 37:40.160\n It does have a connection to energy and matter.\n\n37:40.160 --> 37:41.700\n So it's at that level.\n\n37:41.700 --> 37:43.280\n Yeah, it involves,\n\n37:43.280 --> 37:48.280\n and that's why the version of a theory of events\n\n37:48.320 --> 37:50.840\n that I've developed with Marina Cortez,\n\n37:50.840 --> 37:54.040\n and it's, by the way, I wanna mention my collaborators,\n\n37:54.040 --> 37:55.920\n because they've been at least as important\n\n37:55.920 --> 37:57.800\n in this work as I have.\n\n37:57.800 --> 38:02.800\n It's Marina Cortez in all the work since about 2013,\n\n38:02.920 --> 38:07.440\n 2012, 2013, about causality, causal sets.\n\n38:07.440 --> 38:11.200\n And in the period before that, Roberta Mangibera Unger,\n\n38:11.200 --> 38:14.760\n who is a philosopher and a professor of law.\n\n38:14.760 --> 38:16.560\n And that's in your efforts,\n\n38:16.560 --> 38:17.760\n together with your collaborators,\n\n38:17.760 --> 38:20.120\n to finish the unfinished revolution.\n\n38:20.120 --> 38:20.940\n Yes.\n\n38:20.940 --> 38:23.560\n And focus on causality as a fundamental.\n\n38:23.560 --> 38:24.400\n Yes.\n\n38:24.400 --> 38:26.520\n As fundamental to physics.\n\n38:26.520 --> 38:28.080\n So.\n\n38:28.080 --> 38:30.400\n And there's certainly other people we've worked with,\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:32.720\n but those two people's thinking\n\n38:32.720 --> 38:34.920\n had a huge influence on my own thinking.\n\n38:34.920 --> 38:36.800\n So in the way you describe causality,\n\n38:36.800 --> 38:39.480\n that's what you mean of time being fundamental.\n\n38:39.480 --> 38:41.560\n That causality is fundamental.\n\n38:41.560 --> 38:42.400\n Yes.\n\n38:43.640 --> 38:47.320\n And what does it mean for space to not be fundamental,\n\n38:47.320 --> 38:48.160\n to be emergent?\n\n38:48.160 --> 38:48.980\n That's very good.\n\n38:48.980 --> 38:52.600\n There's a level of description in which there are events,\n\n38:52.600 --> 38:57.080\n there are events create other events,\n\n38:58.160 --> 38:59.280\n but there's no space.\n\n38:59.280 --> 39:00.720\n They don't live in space.\n\n39:00.720 --> 39:04.000\n They have an order in which they caused each other.\n\n39:04.000 --> 39:07.560\n And that is part of the nature of time for us.\n\n39:07.560 --> 39:12.560\n But there is an emergent approximate description.\n\n39:13.720 --> 39:15.560\n And you asked me to define emergent.\n\n39:15.560 --> 39:17.160\n I didn't.\n\n39:17.160 --> 39:22.160\n An emergent property is a property\n\n39:22.400 --> 39:26.480\n that arises at some level of complexity,\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:31.240\n larger than and more complex than the fundamental level,\n\n39:31.240 --> 39:36.120\n which requires some property to describe it,\n\n39:36.120 --> 39:37.960\n which is not directly\n\n39:40.600 --> 39:44.600\n explicable or derivable is the word I want\n\n39:44.600 --> 39:48.640\n from the properties of the fundamental things.\n\n39:48.640 --> 39:50.800\n And space is one of those things\n\n39:50.800 --> 39:53.120\n in a sufficiently complex universe,\n\n39:53.120 --> 39:58.120\n space, three dimensional position of things emerged.\n\n39:58.280 --> 39:59.880\n Yes, and we have this,\n\n39:59.880 --> 40:03.920\n we saw how this happens in detail in some models,\n\n40:03.920 --> 40:07.640\n both computationally and analytically.\n\n40:07.640 --> 40:11.240\n Okay, so connected to space is the idea of locality.\n\n40:11.240 --> 40:12.080\n Yes.\n\n40:13.360 --> 40:15.200\n So we've talked about realism.\n\n40:15.200 --> 40:19.840\n So I live in this world that like sports.\n\n40:21.520 --> 40:25.400\n Locality is a thing that you can affect things close to you\n\n40:26.280 --> 40:29.800\n and don't have an effect on things that are far away.\n\n40:29.800 --> 40:32.880\n It's the thing that bothers me about gravity in general\n\n40:32.880 --> 40:35.120\n or action at a distance.\n\n40:35.120 --> 40:37.400\n Same thing that probably bothered Newton,\n\n40:37.400 --> 40:40.080\n or at least he said a little bit about it.\n\n40:43.880 --> 40:45.560\n Okay, so what do you think about locality?\n\n40:45.560 --> 40:47.000\n Is it just a construct?\n\n40:48.720 --> 40:51.680\n Is it us humans just like this idea\n\n40:51.680 --> 40:54.200\n and are connected to it because we exist in it,\n\n40:54.200 --> 40:57.120\n we need it for our survival, but it's not fundamental?\n\n40:57.120 --> 40:58.920\n I mean, it seems crazy for it not to be\n\n40:58.920 --> 41:01.920\n a fundamental aspect of our reality.\n\n41:01.920 --> 41:03.040\n It does.\n\n41:03.040 --> 41:05.920\n Can you comfort me on a sort of as a therapist,\n\n41:05.920 --> 41:07.840\n like how do I?\n\n41:07.840 --> 41:10.400\n I'm not a good therapist, but I'll do my best.\n\n41:10.400 --> 41:11.240\n Okay.\n\n41:13.440 --> 41:16.800\n There are several different definitions of locality\n\n41:16.800 --> 41:19.640\n when you come to talk about locality in physics.\n\n41:20.720 --> 41:23.680\n In quantum field theory,\n\n41:23.680 --> 41:27.520\n which is a mixture of special relativity\n\n41:27.520 --> 41:29.640\n and quantum mechanics,\n\n41:29.640 --> 41:32.640\n there is a precise definition of locality.\n\n41:33.840 --> 41:37.560\n Field operators corresponding to events in space time,\n\n41:37.560 --> 41:38.960\n which are space like separated,\n\n41:38.960 --> 41:41.480\n commute with each other as operators.\n\n41:41.480 --> 41:43.520\n So in quantum mechanics,\n\n41:43.520 --> 41:46.200\n you think about the nature of reality as fields\n\n41:46.200 --> 41:48.800\n and things that are close in a field\n\n41:48.800 --> 41:53.000\n have an impact on each other more than farther away.\n\n41:53.000 --> 41:54.200\n That's, yes.\n\n41:54.200 --> 41:55.560\n That's very comforting.\n\n41:55.560 --> 41:56.400\n That makes sense.\n\n41:56.400 --> 41:58.400\n So that's a property of quantum field theory\n\n41:58.400 --> 42:00.320\n and it's well tested.\n\n42:00.320 --> 42:04.920\n Unfortunately, there's another definition of local,\n\n42:04.920 --> 42:07.680\n which was expressed by Einstein\n\n42:07.680 --> 42:11.080\n and expressed more precisely by John Bell,\n\n42:11.080 --> 42:15.720\n which has been tested experimentally and found to fail.\n\n42:15.720 --> 42:19.600\n And this set up is you take two particles.\n\n42:19.600 --> 42:24.000\n So one thing that's really weird about quantum mechanics\n\n42:24.000 --> 42:26.480\n is a property called entanglement.\n\n42:26.480 --> 42:28.880\n You can have two particles interact\n\n42:28.880 --> 42:31.200\n and then share a property\n\n42:31.200 --> 42:32.680\n without it being a property\n\n42:32.680 --> 42:35.400\n of either one of the two particles.\n\n42:35.400 --> 42:38.480\n And if you take such a system\n\n42:38.480 --> 42:43.440\n and then you make a measurement on particle A,\n\n42:43.440 --> 42:46.040\n which is over here on my right side,\n\n42:46.040 --> 42:48.200\n and particle B, which is over here.\n\n42:48.200 --> 42:50.760\n Somebody else makes a measurement of particle B.\n\n42:50.760 --> 42:55.760\n You can ask that whatever is the real reality\n\n42:56.840 --> 43:01.840\n of particle B, it not be affected by the choice\n\n43:01.960 --> 43:04.680\n the observer at particle A makes about what to measure,\n\n43:04.680 --> 43:06.160\n not the outcome,\n\n43:06.160 --> 43:09.680\n just the choice of the different things they might measure.\n\n43:09.680 --> 43:11.400\n And that's a notion of locality\n\n43:11.400 --> 43:13.240\n because it assumes that these things\n\n43:13.240 --> 43:16.080\n are very far spaced like separated.\n\n43:16.080 --> 43:19.040\n And it's gonna take a while for any information\n\n43:19.040 --> 43:22.160\n about the choice made by the people here at A\n\n43:22.160 --> 43:24.080\n to affect the reality at B.\n\n43:24.080 --> 43:25.480\n But you make that assumption,\n\n43:25.480 --> 43:27.600\n that's called Bell locality.\n\n43:27.600 --> 43:30.120\n And you derive a certain inequality\n\n43:30.120 --> 43:32.400\n that some correlations,\n\n43:32.400 --> 43:36.040\n functions of correlations have to satisfy.\n\n43:36.040 --> 43:39.360\n And then you can test that pretty directly\n\n43:39.360 --> 43:42.280\n in experiments which create pairs of photons\n\n43:42.280 --> 43:44.000\n or other particles.\n\n43:44.000 --> 43:46.800\n And it's wrong by many sigma.\n\n43:46.800 --> 43:49.920\n In experiment, it doesn't match.\n\n43:49.920 --> 43:51.840\n So what does that mean?\n\n43:51.840 --> 43:54.600\n That means that that definition of locality\n\n43:54.600 --> 43:56.440\n I stated is false.\n\n43:56.440 --> 43:58.840\n The one that Einstein was playing with.\n\n43:58.840 --> 44:00.720\n Yeah, and the one that I stated,\n\n44:00.720 --> 44:04.760\n that is it's not true that whatever is real\n\n44:04.760 --> 44:08.720\n about particle B is unaffected by the choice\n\n44:08.720 --> 44:10.960\n that the observer makes as to what to measure\n\n44:10.960 --> 44:12.200\n in particle A.\n\n44:12.200 --> 44:14.600\n No matter how long they've been propagating\n\n44:14.600 --> 44:17.640\n at almost the speed of light or the speed of light\n\n44:17.640 --> 44:19.360\n away from each other, it's no matter.\n\n44:19.360 --> 44:22.000\n So like the distance between them.\n\n44:22.000 --> 44:23.640\n Well, it's been tested, of course,\n\n44:23.640 --> 44:27.560\n if you want to have hope for quantum mechanics\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:30.320\n being incomplete or wrong and corrected\n\n44:30.320 --> 44:32.440\n by something that changes this.\n\n44:32.440 --> 44:35.880\n It's been tested over a number of kilometers.\n\n44:35.880 --> 44:39.440\n I don't remember whether it's 25 kilometers\n\n44:39.440 --> 44:42.160\n or a hundred and something kilometers, but.\n\n44:42.160 --> 44:47.160\n So in trying to solve the unsolved revolution,\n\n44:47.800 --> 44:50.200\n in trying to come up with the theory for everything,\n\n44:50.200 --> 44:55.200\n is causality fundamental and breaking away from locality?\n\n44:57.600 --> 44:58.440\n Absolutely.\n\n44:59.400 --> 45:00.480\n A crucial step.\n\n45:00.480 --> 45:04.080\n So in your book, essentially, those are the two things\n\n45:04.080 --> 45:07.880\n we really need to think about as a community.\n\n45:07.880 --> 45:12.120\n Especially the physics community has to think about this.\n\n45:12.120 --> 45:15.680\n I guess my question is, how do we solve?\n\n45:15.680 --> 45:19.120\n How do we finish the unfinished revolution?\n\n45:19.120 --> 45:22.760\n Well, that's, I can only tell you what I'm trying to do\n\n45:22.760 --> 45:27.880\n and what I've abandoned as not working.\n\n45:27.880 --> 45:31.440\n As one ant, smart ant in an ant colony.\n\n45:31.440 --> 45:32.760\n Yep.\n\n45:32.760 --> 45:35.960\n Or maybe dumb, that's why, who knows?\n\n45:35.960 --> 45:40.280\n But anyway, my view of the,\n\n45:40.280 --> 45:43.120\n we've had some nice theories invented.\n\n45:45.040 --> 45:47.240\n There's a bunch of different ones.\n\n45:47.240 --> 45:49.640\n Both relate to quantum mechanics,\n\n45:49.640 --> 45:51.920\n relate to quantum gravity.\n\n45:51.920 --> 45:53.920\n There's a lot to admire\n\n45:53.920 --> 45:56.800\n in many of these different approaches.\n\n45:56.800 --> 45:58.480\n But to my understanding,\n\n45:58.480 --> 46:02.840\n they, none of them completely solve the problems\n\n46:02.840 --> 46:04.080\n that I care about.\n\n46:05.480 --> 46:08.040\n And so we're in a situation\n\n46:08.040 --> 46:11.800\n which is either terrifying for a student\n\n46:11.800 --> 46:14.920\n or full of opportunity for the right student,\n\n46:14.920 --> 46:19.560\n in which we've got more than a dozen attempts.\n\n46:19.560 --> 46:22.120\n And I never thought, I don't think anybody anticipated\n\n46:22.120 --> 46:23.640\n it would work out this way.\n\n46:23.640 --> 46:26.640\n Which work partly and then at some point,\n\n46:26.640 --> 46:28.840\n they have an issue that nobody can figure out\n\n46:28.840 --> 46:30.920\n how to go around or how to solve.\n\n46:31.920 --> 46:36.080\n And that's the situation we're in.\n\n46:36.080 --> 46:39.520\n My reaction to that is twofold.\n\n46:39.520 --> 46:42.640\n One of them is to try to bring people,\n\n46:42.640 --> 46:46.920\n we evolved into this unfortunate sociological situation\n\n46:46.920 --> 46:48.800\n in which there are communities\n\n46:48.800 --> 46:50.680\n around some of these approaches.\n\n46:50.680 --> 46:53.720\n And to borrow again, a metaphor from Eric,\n\n46:53.720 --> 46:58.000\n they sit on top of hills in the landscape of theories\n\n46:58.000 --> 47:00.360\n and throw rocks at each other.\n\n47:00.360 --> 47:02.840\n And as Eric says, we need two things.\n\n47:02.840 --> 47:05.400\n We need people to get off their hills\n\n47:05.400 --> 47:08.680\n and come down into the valleys and party and talk\n\n47:08.680 --> 47:13.000\n and become friendly and learn to say,\n\n47:14.120 --> 47:18.200\n not no but, but yes and yes.\n\n47:18.200 --> 47:19.640\n Your idea goes this far,\n\n47:19.640 --> 47:21.800\n but maybe if we put it together with my idea,\n\n47:21.800 --> 47:22.920\n we can go further.\n\n47:22.920 --> 47:23.760\n Yes.\n\n47:25.160 --> 47:29.280\n So in that spirit, I've talked several times\n\n47:29.280 --> 47:32.680\n with Sean Carroll, who's also written\n\n47:32.680 --> 47:34.200\n an excellent book recently.\n\n47:34.200 --> 47:36.880\n And he kind of, he plays around,\n\n47:36.880 --> 47:39.000\n is a big fan of the many worlds interpretation\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:40.400\n of quantum mechanics.\n\n47:40.400 --> 47:42.960\n So I'm a troublemaker.\n\n47:42.960 --> 47:47.280\n So let me ask, what's your sense of Sean\n\n47:47.280 --> 47:50.000\n and the idea of many worlds interpretation?\n\n47:50.000 --> 47:52.760\n I've read many the commentary back and forth.\n\n47:52.760 --> 47:55.800\n You guys are friendly, respect each other,\n\n47:55.800 --> 47:57.400\n but have a lot of fun debating.\n\n47:57.400 --> 48:02.280\n I love Sean and he, no, I really,\n\n48:02.280 --> 48:07.280\n he's articulate and he's a great representative\n\n48:07.920 --> 48:10.280\n or ambassador of science to the public\n\n48:10.280 --> 48:13.400\n and for different fields of science to each other.\n\n48:14.280 --> 48:19.280\n He also, like I do, takes philosophy seriously.\n\n48:19.440 --> 48:24.360\n And unlike what I do in all cases,\n\n48:24.360 --> 48:26.440\n he has really done the homework.\n\n48:26.440 --> 48:29.120\n He's read a lot, he knows the people,\n\n48:29.120 --> 48:34.120\n he talks to them, he exposes his arguments to them.\n\n48:34.320 --> 48:37.520\n And I, there's this mysterious thing\n\n48:37.520 --> 48:40.680\n that we so often end up on the opposite sides\n\n48:40.680 --> 48:41.800\n of one of these issues.\n\n48:41.800 --> 48:43.080\n It's fun though.\n\n48:43.080 --> 48:47.720\n It's fun and I'd love to have a conversation about that,\n\n48:47.720 --> 48:50.120\n but I would want to include him.\n\n48:50.120 --> 48:52.160\n I see, about many worlds, well.\n\n48:52.160 --> 48:54.080\n No, I can tell you what I think about many worlds.\n\n48:54.080 --> 48:56.160\n I'd love to, but actually on that, let me pause.\n\n48:56.160 --> 48:57.360\n Sean has a podcast.\n\n48:57.360 --> 49:00.000\n You should definitely figure out how to talk to Sean.\n\n49:00.000 --> 49:01.720\n I would, I actually told Sean,\n\n49:01.720 --> 49:05.040\n I would love to hear you guys just going back and forth.\n\n49:05.040 --> 49:07.520\n So I hope you can make that happen eventually,\n\n49:07.520 --> 49:08.360\n you and Sean.\n\n49:08.360 --> 49:09.560\n I won't tell you what it is,\n\n49:09.560 --> 49:12.120\n but there's something that Sean said to me\n\n49:12.120 --> 49:17.120\n in June of 2016 that changed my whole approach to a problem.\n\n49:17.240 --> 49:19.240\n But I'll have to tell him first.\n\n49:19.240 --> 49:23.280\n Yes, and that, that'll be great to tell him on his podcast.\n\n49:23.280 --> 49:24.120\n So.\n\n49:24.120 --> 49:26.280\n I can't invite myself to his podcast.\n\n49:26.280 --> 49:28.560\n But I told him, yeah, okay, we'll make it happen.\n\n49:28.560 --> 49:30.000\n So many worlds.\n\n49:30.000 --> 49:30.840\n Anyway.\n\n49:31.720 --> 49:32.560\n What's your view?\n\n49:32.560 --> 49:34.840\n Many worlds, we talk about nonlocality.\n\n49:34.840 --> 49:39.800\n Many worlds is also a very uncomfortable idea\n\n49:39.800 --> 49:43.400\n or beautiful depending on your perspective.\n\n49:43.400 --> 49:48.400\n It's very nice in terms of,\n\n49:49.000 --> 49:50.600\n I mean, there's a realist aspect to it.\n\n49:50.600 --> 49:52.560\n I think you called it magical realism.\n\n49:52.560 --> 49:53.400\n Yeah.\n\n49:53.400 --> 49:55.720\n It's just a beautiful line.\n\n49:55.720 --> 49:57.800\n But at the same time,\n\n49:57.800 --> 50:00.640\n it's very difficult to far limited human minds\n\n50:00.640 --> 50:01.480\n to comprehend.\n\n50:01.480 --> 50:03.240\n So what are your thoughts about it?\n\n50:04.960 --> 50:08.640\n Let me start with the easy and obvious\n\n50:08.640 --> 50:10.760\n and then go to the scientific.\n\n50:10.760 --> 50:12.280\n Okay.\n\n50:12.280 --> 50:13.520\n It doesn't appeal to me.\n\n50:13.520 --> 50:17.720\n It doesn't answer the questions that I want answered.\n\n50:17.720 --> 50:20.480\n And it does so to such a strong case\n\n50:20.480 --> 50:23.280\n that when Roberto Mangueber Anger and I\n\n50:23.280 --> 50:24.960\n began looking for principles,\n\n50:24.960 --> 50:26.440\n and I want to come back and talk about\n\n50:26.440 --> 50:28.640\n the use of principles in science,\n\n50:28.640 --> 50:30.240\n because that's the other thing I was going to say,\n\n50:30.240 --> 50:32.560\n and I don't want to lose that.\n\n50:32.560 --> 50:34.720\n When we started looking for principles,\n\n50:34.720 --> 50:36.040\n we made our first principle,\n\n50:36.040 --> 50:39.080\n there is just one world and it happens once.\n\n50:39.960 --> 50:44.960\n But so it's not helpful to my personal approach,\n\n50:47.160 --> 50:49.120\n to my personal agenda,\n\n50:49.120 --> 50:51.400\n but of course I'm part of a community.\n\n50:51.400 --> 50:56.400\n And my sense of the many worlds interpretation,\n\n50:57.040 --> 51:00.800\n I have thought a lot about it and struggled a lot with it,\n\n51:00.800 --> 51:02.840\n is the following.\n\n51:05.320 --> 51:07.840\n First of all, there's Everett himself,\n\n51:07.840 --> 51:09.360\n there's what's in Everett.\n\n51:10.600 --> 51:13.560\n And there are several issues there\n\n51:13.560 --> 51:16.880\n connected with the derivation of the Born Rule,\n\n51:16.880 --> 51:20.960\n which is the rule that gives probabilities to events.\n\n51:20.960 --> 51:25.440\n And the reasons why there is a problem with probability\n\n51:25.440 --> 51:28.480\n is that I mentioned the two ways\n\n51:28.480 --> 51:31.280\n that physical systems can evolve.\n\n51:31.280 --> 51:34.440\n The many worlds interpretation cuts off,\n\n51:34.440 --> 51:37.120\n one, the one having to do with measurement,\n\n51:37.120 --> 51:39.760\n and just has the other one, the Schrodinger evolution,\n\n51:39.760 --> 51:43.040\n which is this smooth evolution of the quantum state.\n\n51:44.000 --> 51:48.720\n But the notion of probability is only in the second rule,\n\n51:48.720 --> 51:50.840\n which we've thrown away.\n\n51:50.840 --> 51:52.600\n So where does probability come from?\n\n51:52.600 --> 51:54.960\n And you have to answer the question\n\n51:54.960 --> 51:57.720\n because experimentalists use probabilities\n\n51:57.720 --> 51:58.920\n to check the theory.\n\n52:00.400 --> 52:05.040\n Now, at first sight, you get very confused\n\n52:05.040 --> 52:07.520\n because there seems to be a real problem\n\n52:07.520 --> 52:10.960\n because in the many worlds interpretation,\n\n52:10.960 --> 52:13.480\n this talk about branches is not quite precise,\n\n52:13.480 --> 52:14.520\n but I'll use it.\n\n52:16.360 --> 52:19.240\n There's a branch in which everything that might happen\n\n52:19.240 --> 52:23.880\n does happen with probability one in that branch.\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:27.440\n You might think you could count the number of branches\n\n52:27.440 --> 52:30.280\n in which things do and don't happen\n\n52:30.280 --> 52:32.360\n and get numbers that you can define\n\n52:32.360 --> 52:34.880\n as something like frequentist probabilities.\n\n52:35.760 --> 52:40.200\n And Everett did have an argument in that direction,\n\n52:41.120 --> 52:43.280\n but the argument gets very subtle\n\n52:43.280 --> 52:45.800\n when there are an infinite number of possibilities,\n\n52:45.800 --> 52:49.000\n as is the case in most quantum systems.\n\n52:49.000 --> 52:50.600\n And my understanding,\n\n52:50.600 --> 52:54.840\n although I'm not as much of an expert as some other people,\n\n52:54.840 --> 52:59.440\n is that Everett's own proposal failed, did not work.\n\n53:00.760 --> 53:05.480\n There are then, but it doesn't stop there.\n\n53:05.480 --> 53:08.560\n There is an important idea that Everett didn't know about,\n\n53:08.560 --> 53:10.000\n which is decoherence,\n\n53:10.000 --> 53:13.680\n and it is a phenomenon that might be very much relevant.\n\n53:13.680 --> 53:18.680\n And so a number of people post Everett\n\n53:19.080 --> 53:22.280\n have tried to make versions of what you might call\n\n53:22.280 --> 53:24.240\n many worlds quantum mechanics.\n\n53:26.160 --> 53:29.640\n And this is a big area and it's subtle,\n\n53:29.640 --> 53:33.080\n and it's not the kind of thing that I do well.\n\n53:33.080 --> 53:36.200\n So I consulted, that's why there's two chapters on this\n\n53:36.200 --> 53:37.560\n in the book I wrote.\n\n53:37.560 --> 53:39.680\n Chapter 10, which is about Everett's version,\n\n53:39.680 --> 53:44.600\n chapter 11, there's a very good group of philosophers\n\n53:44.600 --> 53:49.440\n of physics in Oxford, Simon Saunders, David Wallace,\n\n53:49.440 --> 53:52.800\n Harvey Brown, and a number of others.\n\n53:52.800 --> 53:57.120\n And of course there's David Deutsch, who is there.\n\n53:57.120 --> 54:01.480\n And those people have developed and put a lot of work\n\n54:01.480 --> 54:04.280\n into a very sophisticated set of ideas\n\n54:04.280 --> 54:07.560\n designed to come back and answer that question.\n\n54:07.560 --> 54:11.400\n They have the flavor of there are really no probabilities,\n\n54:11.400 --> 54:15.720\n we admit that, but imagine if the Everett story was true\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:18.760\n and you were living in that multiverse,\n\n54:18.760 --> 54:20.960\n how would you make bets?\n\n54:20.960 --> 54:24.640\n And so they use decision theory\n\n54:24.640 --> 54:28.640\n from the theory of probability and gambling and so forth\n\n54:28.640 --> 54:33.040\n to shape a story of how you would bet\n\n54:33.040 --> 54:35.400\n if you were inside an Everett in the universe\n\n54:35.400 --> 54:37.800\n and you knew that.\n\n54:37.800 --> 54:41.920\n And there's a debate among those experts\n\n54:41.920 --> 54:47.560\n as to whether they or somebody else has really succeeded.\n\n54:47.560 --> 54:50.760\n And when I checked in as I was finishing the book\n\n54:50.760 --> 54:52.800\n with some of those people, like Simon,\n\n54:52.800 --> 54:56.600\n who's a good friend of mine, and David Wallace,\n\n54:56.600 --> 54:59.240\n they told me that they weren't sure\n\n54:59.240 --> 55:02.160\n that any of them was yet correct.\n\n55:02.160 --> 55:04.840\n So that's what I put in my book.\n\n55:04.840 --> 55:08.160\n Now, to add to that, Sean has his own approach\n\n55:08.160 --> 55:10.720\n to that problem in what's called self referencing\n\n55:10.720 --> 55:13.480\n or self locating observers.\n\n55:14.640 --> 55:19.640\n And it doesn't, I tried to read it\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:22.520\n and it didn't make sense to me,\n\n55:22.520 --> 55:24.120\n but I didn't study it hard,\n\n55:24.120 --> 55:25.480\n I didn't communicate with Sean,\n\n55:25.480 --> 55:27.000\n I didn't do the things that I would do,\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:29.360\n so I had nothing to say about it in the book.\n\n55:30.680 --> 55:32.800\n I don't know whether it's right or not.\n\n55:32.800 --> 55:36.520\n Let's talk a little bit about science.\n\n55:36.520 --> 55:39.800\n You mentioned the use of principles in science.\n\n55:40.920 --> 55:43.080\n What does it mean to have a principle\n\n55:43.080 --> 55:45.360\n and why is that important?\n\n55:45.360 --> 55:48.440\n When I feel very frustrated about quantum gravity,\n\n55:48.440 --> 55:50.720\n I like to go back and read history.\n\n55:51.840 --> 55:55.160\n And of course, Einstein, his achievements\n\n55:55.160 --> 55:59.840\n are a huge lesson and hopefully something\n\n55:59.840 --> 56:00.840\n like a role model.\n\n56:00.840 --> 56:05.200\n And it's very clear that Einstein thought\n\n56:05.200 --> 56:09.080\n that the first job when you wanna enter a new domain\n\n56:09.080 --> 56:13.400\n of theoretical physics is to discover and invent principles\n\n56:13.400 --> 56:15.880\n and then make models of how those principles\n\n56:15.880 --> 56:19.280\n might be applied in some experimental situation,\n\n56:19.280 --> 56:22.440\n which is where the mathematics comes in.\n\n56:22.440 --> 56:27.440\n So for Einstein, there was no unified space and time.\n\n56:27.440 --> 56:30.760\n Minkowski invented this idea of space time.\n\n56:30.760 --> 56:33.760\n For Einstein, it was a model of his principles\n\n56:33.760 --> 56:34.920\n or his postulates.\n\n56:36.120 --> 56:41.120\n And I've taken the view that we don't know\n\n56:41.280 --> 56:43.440\n the principles of quantum gravity.\n\n56:43.440 --> 56:46.920\n I can think about candidates and I have some papers\n\n56:46.920 --> 56:50.120\n where I discuss different candidates\n\n56:50.120 --> 56:52.520\n and I'm happy to discuss them.\n\n56:52.520 --> 56:56.840\n But my belief now is that those partially successful\n\n56:56.840 --> 57:00.640\n approaches are all models,\n\n57:01.680 --> 57:05.880\n which might describe indeed some quantum gravity physics\n\n57:05.880 --> 57:08.960\n in some domain, in some aspect,\n\n57:08.960 --> 57:12.720\n but ultimately would be important\n\n57:12.720 --> 57:15.200\n because they model the principles\n\n57:15.200 --> 57:18.200\n and the first job is to tie down those principles.\n\n57:18.200 --> 57:21.280\n So that's the approach that I'm taking.\n\n57:21.280 --> 57:26.240\n So speaking of principles, in your 2006 book,\n\n57:26.240 --> 57:30.920\n The Trouble with Physics, you criticized a bit\n\n57:30.920 --> 57:34.160\n string theory for taking us away from the rigors\n\n57:34.160 --> 57:37.120\n of the scientific method or whatever you would call it.\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:42.120\n But what's the trouble with physics today\n\n57:42.760 --> 57:44.240\n and how do we fix it?\n\n57:44.240 --> 57:47.400\n Can I say how I read that book?\n\n57:47.400 --> 57:48.240\n Sure.\n\n57:48.240 --> 57:52.440\n Because I, and I'm not, this of course has to be my fault\n\n57:52.440 --> 57:55.680\n because you can't as an author claim\n\n57:55.680 --> 57:58.320\n after all the work you put in that you are misread.\n\n57:59.480 --> 58:04.480\n But I will say that many of the reviewers\n\n58:04.600 --> 58:06.520\n who are not personally involved\n\n58:06.520 --> 58:09.720\n and even many who were working on string theory\n\n58:09.720 --> 58:12.400\n or some other approach to quantum gravity\n\n58:12.400 --> 58:14.360\n told me, communicated with me and told me\n\n58:14.360 --> 58:16.120\n they thought that I was fair\n\n58:17.360 --> 58:20.840\n and balance was the word that was usually used.\n\n58:20.840 --> 58:24.040\n So let me tell you what my purpose was in writing that book,\n\n58:24.040 --> 58:28.760\n which clearly got diverted by,\n\n58:28.760 --> 58:33.760\n because there was already a rather hot argument going on.\n\n58:35.160 --> 58:36.000\n And this is.\n\n58:36.000 --> 58:36.840\n On which topic?\n\n58:36.840 --> 58:38.600\n On string theory specifically?\n\n58:38.600 --> 58:40.180\n Or in general in physics?\n\n58:41.060 --> 58:44.060\n No, more specifically than string theory.\n\n58:44.060 --> 58:47.680\n So since we're in Cambridge, can I say that?\n\n58:47.680 --> 58:48.520\n We're doing this in Cambridge.\n\n58:48.520 --> 58:49.360\n Yeah, yeah, of course.\n\n58:49.360 --> 58:52.680\n Cambridge, just to be clear, Massachusetts.\n\n58:52.680 --> 58:55.600\n And on Harvard campus.\n\n58:55.600 --> 59:00.600\n Right, so Andy Straminger is a good friend of mine\n\n59:00.600 --> 59:03.460\n and has been for many, many years.\n\n59:03.460 --> 59:08.460\n And Andy, so originally there was this beautiful idea\n\n59:09.440 --> 59:11.360\n that there were five string theories\n\n59:11.360 --> 59:14.420\n and maybe they would be unified into one.\n\n59:14.420 --> 59:18.520\n And we would discover a way to break that symmetries\n\n59:18.520 --> 59:20.640\n of one of those string theories\n\n59:20.640 --> 59:22.760\n and discover the standard model\n\n59:22.760 --> 59:24.560\n and predict all the properties\n\n59:24.560 --> 59:26.280\n of standard model particles,\n\n59:26.280 --> 59:28.960\n like their masses and charges and so forth,\n\n59:28.960 --> 59:30.120\n coupling constants.\n\n59:31.560 --> 59:34.880\n And then there was a bunch of solutions\n\n59:35.840 --> 59:37.240\n to string theory found,\n\n59:37.240 --> 59:39.700\n which led each of them to a different version\n\n59:39.700 --> 59:42.680\n of particle physics with a different phenomenology.\n\n59:42.680 --> 59:46.560\n These are called the Calabi Yao manifolds,\n\n59:46.560 --> 59:50.280\n named after Yao, who is also here.\n\n59:50.280 --> 59:52.440\n Not, certainly we've been friends\n\n59:52.440 --> 59:54.260\n at some time in the past anyway.\n\n59:55.400 --> 59:57.880\n And then there were, nobody was sure,\n\n59:57.880 --> 1:00:00.200\n but hundreds of thousands of different versions\n\n1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:01.840\n of string theory.\n\n1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:04.620\n And then Andy found there was a way\n\n1:00:04.620 --> 1:00:07.480\n to put a certain kind of mathematical curvature\n\n1:00:07.480 --> 1:00:10.440\n called torsion into the solutions.\n\n1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:13.860\n And he wrote a paper, String Theory with Torsion,\n\n1:00:13.860 --> 1:00:15.940\n in which he discovered there was,\n\n1:00:15.940 --> 1:00:20.180\n and not formally uncountable,\n\n1:00:20.180 --> 1:00:22.220\n but he was unable to invent any way\n\n1:00:22.220 --> 1:00:24.580\n to count the number of solutions\n\n1:00:24.580 --> 1:00:27.480\n or classify the diverse solutions.\n\n1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:31.100\n And he wrote that this is worrying\n\n1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:33.900\n because doing phenomenology the old fashioned way\n\n1:00:33.900 --> 1:00:37.420\n by solving the theory is not gonna work\n\n1:00:37.420 --> 1:00:41.100\n because there's gonna be loads of solutions\n\n1:00:41.100 --> 1:00:42.940\n for every proposed phenomenology\n\n1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:45.220\n for anything the experiments discovered.\n\n1:00:45.220 --> 1:00:47.500\n And it hasn't quite worked out that way.\n\n1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:50.580\n But nonetheless, he took that worry to me.\n\n1:00:51.700 --> 1:00:56.660\n We spoke at least once, maybe two or three times about that.\n\n1:00:56.660 --> 1:00:59.040\n And I got seriously worried about that.\n\n1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:02.460\n And this is just a little.\n\n1:01:02.460 --> 1:01:05.020\n So it's like an anecdote that inspired\n\n1:01:05.020 --> 1:01:07.280\n your worry about string theory in general?\n\n1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:10.100\n Well, I tried to solve the problem\n\n1:01:10.100 --> 1:01:12.960\n and I tried to solve the problem.\n\n1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:15.740\n I was reading at that time, a lot of biology,\n\n1:01:15.740 --> 1:01:17.300\n a lot of evolutionary theory,\n\n1:01:17.300 --> 1:01:22.300\n like Linmar Gullis and Steve Gould and so forth.\n\n1:01:23.100 --> 1:01:28.100\n And I could take your time to go through the things,\n\n1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:30.580\n but it occurred to me,\n\n1:01:30.580 --> 1:01:33.980\n maybe physics was like evolutionary biology\n\n1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:36.060\n and maybe the laws evolved.\n\n1:01:36.060 --> 1:01:40.060\n And there was, the biologists talk about a landscape,\n\n1:01:40.060 --> 1:01:44.040\n a fitness landscape of DNA sequences\n\n1:01:44.040 --> 1:01:48.780\n or protein sequences or species or something like that.\n\n1:01:48.780 --> 1:01:51.340\n And I took their concept and the word landscape\n\n1:01:51.340 --> 1:01:54.540\n from theoretical biology and made a scenario\n\n1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:59.060\n about how the universe as a whole could evolve\n\n1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:03.540\n to discover the parameters of the standard model.\n\n1:02:03.540 --> 1:02:04.620\n And I'm happy to discuss,\n\n1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:07.220\n that's called cosmological natural selection.\n\n1:02:07.220 --> 1:02:09.900\n Cosmological natural selection.\n\n1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:10.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:10.740 --> 1:02:12.580\n Wow, so the parameters of the standard model,\n\n1:02:12.580 --> 1:02:15.540\n so the laws of physics are changing.\n\n1:02:15.540 --> 1:02:18.940\n This idea would say that the laws of physics\n\n1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:23.420\n are changing in some way that echoes\n\n1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:24.900\n that of natural selection,\n\n1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:28.860\n or just it adjusts in some way towards some goal.\n\n1:02:28.860 --> 1:02:30.000\n Yes.\n\n1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.580\n And I published that,\n\n1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:36.620\n I wrote the paper in 1888 or 89,\n\n1:02:36.620 --> 1:02:39.140\n the paper was published in 92.\n\n1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:40.980\n My first book in 1997,\n\n1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:45.500\n The Life of the Cosmos was explicitly about that.\n\n1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:49.300\n And I was very clear that what was important\n\n1:02:49.300 --> 1:02:54.300\n is that because you would develop an ensemble of universes,\n\n1:02:55.020 --> 1:02:59.260\n but they were related by descent to natural selection,\n\n1:03:00.580 --> 1:03:03.500\n almost every universe would share the property\n\n1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:08.500\n that it was, its fitness was maximized to some extent,\n\n1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:10.920\n or at least close to maximum.\n\n1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:12.480\n And I could deduce predictions\n\n1:03:12.480 --> 1:03:16.080\n that could be tested from that.\n\n1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:18.220\n And I worked all of that out\n\n1:03:18.220 --> 1:03:20.440\n and I compared it to the anthropic principle\n\n1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:23.320\n where you weren't able to make tests\n\n1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:24.480\n or make falsifications.\n\n1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:28.400\n All of this was in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\n1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:30.000\n That's a really compelling notion,\n\n1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:32.840\n but how does that help you arrive?\n\n1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:36.040\n I'm coming to where the book came from.\n\n1:03:36.040 --> 1:03:37.000\n Yes.\n\n1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.080\n So what got me,\n\n1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:42.720\n I worked on string theory.\n\n1:03:42.720 --> 1:03:47.480\n I also worked on loop quantum gravity.\n\n1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:50.640\n And I was one of the inventors of loop quantum gravity.\n\n1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:55.480\n And because of my strong belief in some other principles,\n\n1:03:55.480 --> 1:03:58.040\n which led to this notion of wanting a quantum theory\n\n1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:00.880\n of gravity to be what we call relational\n\n1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:03.020\n or background independent,\n\n1:04:03.020 --> 1:04:05.960\n I tried very hard to make string theory\n\n1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:07.600\n background independent.\n\n1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:09.840\n And it ended up developing a bunch of tools\n\n1:04:09.840 --> 1:04:12.600\n which then could apply directly to general relativity\n\n1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:15.020\n and that became loop quantum gravity.\n\n1:04:15.020 --> 1:04:17.280\n So the things were very closely related\n\n1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:20.440\n and have always been very closely related in my mind.\n\n1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:22.160\n The idea that there were two communities,\n\n1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:25.320\n one devoted to strings and one devoted to loops is nuts\n\n1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:27.740\n and has always been nuts.\n\n1:04:28.900 --> 1:04:32.680\n Okay, so anyway, there's this nuts community\n\n1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.000\n of loops and strings that are all beautiful\n\n1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.400\n and compelling and mathematically speaking.\n\n1:04:37.400 --> 1:04:38.800\n And what's the trouble with all that?\n\n1:04:38.800 --> 1:04:40.680\n Why is that such a problem?\n\n1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:45.620\n So I was interested in developing that notion\n\n1:04:45.620 --> 1:04:47.820\n of how science works based on a community\n\n1:04:47.820 --> 1:04:49.700\n and ethics that I told you about.\n\n1:04:50.800 --> 1:04:54.780\n And I wrote a draft of a book about that,\n\n1:04:54.780 --> 1:04:58.860\n which had several chapters on methodology of science.\n\n1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:02.520\n And it was a rather academically oriented book.\n\n1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:06.560\n And those chapters were the first part of the book,\n\n1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:07.680\n the first third of it.\n\n1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:09.880\n And you didn't find their remnants\n\n1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:14.520\n in what's now the last part of the trouble with physics.\n\n1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:18.680\n And then I described a number of test cases, case studies.\n\n1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:21.480\n And one of them, which I knew was the search\n\n1:05:21.480 --> 1:05:24.080\n for quantum gravity and string theory and so forth.\n\n1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:28.660\n And I wasn't able to get that book published.\n\n1:05:28.660 --> 1:05:33.660\n So somebody made the suggestion of flipping it around\n\n1:05:34.700 --> 1:05:36.820\n and starting with a story of string theory,\n\n1:05:36.820 --> 1:05:38.620\n which was already controversial.\n\n1:05:38.620 --> 1:05:42.460\n This was 2004, 2005.\n\n1:05:42.460 --> 1:05:47.460\n But I was very careful to be detailed,\n\n1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:52.900\n to criticize papers and not people.\n\n1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:55.540\n You won't find me criticizing individuals.\n\n1:05:55.540 --> 1:05:59.100\n You'll find me criticizing certain writing.\n\n1:05:59.100 --> 1:06:03.820\n But in any case, here's what I regret.\n\n1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:06.500\n Let me make your program worthwhile.\n\n1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.340\n Yes.\n\n1:06:07.340 --> 1:06:11.980\n As far as I know, with the exception of not understanding\n\n1:06:11.980 --> 1:06:15.380\n how large the applications to condensed matter,\n\n1:06:15.380 --> 1:06:20.380\n say ADS CFT would get,\n\n1:06:20.380 --> 1:06:25.380\n I think largely my diagnosis of string theory\n\n1:06:26.580 --> 1:06:30.380\n as it was then has stood up since 2006.\n\n1:06:31.260 --> 1:06:34.940\n What I regret is that the same critique,\n\n1:06:34.940 --> 1:06:37.540\n I was using string theory as an example,\n\n1:06:37.540 --> 1:06:41.780\n and the same critique applies to many other communities\n\n1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:44.380\n in science and all of, including,\n\n1:06:44.380 --> 1:06:46.500\n and this is where I regret my own community,\n\n1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:49.900\n that is a community of people working on quantum gravity.\n\n1:06:49.900 --> 1:06:52.220\n Not science string theory.\n\n1:06:52.220 --> 1:06:55.860\n But, and I considered saying that explicitly.\n\n1:06:55.860 --> 1:06:57.220\n But to say that explicitly,\n\n1:06:57.220 --> 1:07:00.460\n since it's a small, intimate community,\n\n1:07:00.460 --> 1:07:02.940\n I would be telling stories and naming names\n\n1:07:04.100 --> 1:07:06.420\n and making a kind of history\n\n1:07:06.420 --> 1:07:08.900\n that I have no right to write.\n\n1:07:08.900 --> 1:07:12.060\n So I stayed away from that, but was misunderstood.\n\n1:07:12.060 --> 1:07:16.380\n But if I may ask, is there a hopeful message\n\n1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:20.260\n for theoretical physics that we can take from that book,\n\n1:07:20.260 --> 1:07:22.100\n sort of that looks at the community,\n\n1:07:22.100 --> 1:07:24.780\n not just your own work on,\n\n1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:26.780\n now with causality and nonlocality,\n\n1:07:26.780 --> 1:07:29.060\n but just broadly in understanding\n\n1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:32.060\n the fundamental nature of our reality,\n\n1:07:32.060 --> 1:07:35.940\n what's your hope for the 21st century in physics?\n\n1:07:37.060 --> 1:07:39.660\n Well, that we solve the problem.\n\n1:07:39.660 --> 1:07:44.300\n That we solve the unfinished problem of Einstein's.\n\n1:07:44.300 --> 1:07:47.940\n That's certainly the thing that I care about most in.\n\n1:07:47.940 --> 1:07:49.180\n Hope for most.\n\n1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:50.620\n Let me say one thing.\n\n1:07:50.620 --> 1:07:53.740\n Among the young people that I work with,\n\n1:07:53.740 --> 1:07:58.740\n I hear very often and sense a total disinterest\n\n1:07:59.220 --> 1:08:03.420\n in these arguments that we older scientists have.\n\n1:08:03.420 --> 1:08:05.820\n And an interest in what each other is doing.\n\n1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:09.860\n And this is starting to appear in conferences\n\n1:08:09.860 --> 1:08:13.300\n where the young people interested in quantum gravity\n\n1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:16.300\n make a conference, they invite loops and strings\n\n1:08:16.300 --> 1:08:20.540\n and causal dynamical triangulations and causal set people.\n\n1:08:20.540 --> 1:08:24.060\n And we're having a conference like this next week,\n\n1:08:24.060 --> 1:08:26.980\n a small workshop at perimeter.\n\n1:08:26.980 --> 1:08:28.380\n And I guess I'm advertising this.\n\n1:08:28.380 --> 1:08:30.500\n And then in the summer,\n\n1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:33.460\n we're having a big full on conference,\n\n1:08:33.460 --> 1:08:34.900\n which is just quantum gravity.\n\n1:08:34.900 --> 1:08:37.260\n It's not strings, it's not loops.\n\n1:08:37.260 --> 1:08:39.420\n But the organizers and the speakers\n\n1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:41.780\n will be from all the different communities.\n\n1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:43.420\n And this to me is very helpful.\n\n1:08:45.580 --> 1:08:49.020\n That the different ideas are coming together.\n\n1:08:49.020 --> 1:08:52.300\n At least people are expressing an interest in that.\n\n1:08:54.020 --> 1:08:56.300\n It's a huge honor talking to you, Lee.\n\n1:08:56.300 --> 1:08:57.700\n Thanks so much for your time

nothing but\n\n1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:39.580\n the power of the universe to organize itself.\n\n1:09:39.580 --> 1:10:05.700\n Thanks for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
