network\n\n00:07.360 --> 00:10.040\n that provides data to smart contracts.\n\n00:10.040 --> 00:12.760\n He and his team have done seminal research\n\n00:12.760 --> 00:15.320\n and engineering in the space of smart contracts.\n\n00:15.320 --> 00:17.420\n Check out the Chainlink 2.0 white paper\n\n00:17.420 --> 00:19.380\n that I found to be a great overview\n\n00:19.380 --> 00:21.320\n of their technology and vision.\n\n00:21.320 --> 00:24.700\n It's 136 pages, but very accessible.\n\n00:24.700 --> 00:26.760\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n00:26.760 --> 00:30.920\n Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,\n\n00:30.920 --> 00:32.080\n and BetterHelp.\n\n00:32.080 --> 00:33.480\n Check them out in the description\n\n00:33.480 --> 00:35.400\n to support this podcast.\n\n00:35.400 --> 00:37.180\n As a side note, let me say that\n\n00:37.180 --> 00:39.560\n externally connected smart contracts\n\n00:39.560 --> 00:42.320\n that combine the ocean of data out there\n\n00:42.320 --> 00:45.640\n with the security of the blockchain are fascinating to me,\n\n00:45.640 --> 00:48.240\n both technically and philosophically.\n\n00:48.240 --> 00:51.960\n Data is knowledge, and knowledge is power.\n\n00:51.960 --> 00:55.120\n I think the more reliable data sources we integrate\n\n00:55.120 --> 00:57.520\n into our decision making,\n\n00:57.520 --> 01:00.880\n especially when those decisions are executed by programs,\n\n01:00.880 --> 01:04.460\n the more efficient and productive our decisions become.\n\n01:04.460 --> 01:07.440\n There are interactions between humans\n\n01:07.440 --> 01:10.040\n that should not be formalized digitally,\n\n01:10.040 --> 01:13.680\n like love, for example, but for all the others,\n\n01:13.680 --> 01:15.660\n there's no reason for smart contracts\n\n01:15.660 --> 01:18.820\n not to automate away the menial parts of life,\n\n01:18.820 --> 01:22.920\n making more room for good conversation over brisket\n\n01:22.920 --> 01:26.760\n and maybe some vodka with old and new friends.\n\n01:26.760 --> 01:28.960\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast,\n\n01:28.960 --> 01:32.680\n and here is my conversation with Sergey Nazarov.\n\n01:33.600 --> 01:35.360\n Is that Jozsik there?\n\n01:35.360 --> 01:38.360\n So I gave away everything I own a few times in my life,\n\n01:38.360 --> 01:41.000\n and he accidentally survived,\n\n01:41.000 --> 01:42.660\n and I don't like stuffed animals.\n\n01:42.660 --> 01:44.800\n What I really liked about, I got him in a thrift store.\n\n01:44.800 --> 01:45.960\n What I liked about him is,\n\n01:45.960 --> 01:48.040\n because I'd never seen a stuffed animal\n\n01:48.040 --> 01:50.560\n that looks pissed off at life.\n\n01:50.560 --> 01:53.400\n Like they're usually smiling in the dumbest of ways,\n\n01:53.400 --> 01:56.080\n and this guy was just pissed.\n\n01:56.080 --> 01:58.960\n Yeah, I gotta tell you, that's actually pretty funny.\n\n01:58.960 --> 01:59.920\n I like this guy.\n\n01:59.920 --> 02:02.680\n If you had to live only in the digital world\n\n02:02.680 --> 02:06.120\n or the physical world, which would you choose?\n\n02:06.120 --> 02:08.560\n So I think this is actually a question\n\n02:08.560 --> 02:11.720\n more about what the fidelity of the digital world would be\n\n02:11.720 --> 02:13.360\n versus the physical world.\n\n02:13.360 --> 02:15.200\n I think this type of question,\n\n02:15.200 --> 02:18.200\n this whole simulation thing actually comes from papers\n\n02:18.200 --> 02:21.280\n about 20, 30 years ago in the philosophical world\n\n02:21.280 --> 02:23.720\n where people tried to make this thought experiment\n\n02:23.720 --> 02:25.500\n of would you be comfortable\n\n02:25.500 --> 02:27.340\n if everything that was happening to you\n\n02:27.340 --> 02:28.980\n happened in a simulation?\n\n02:28.980 --> 02:29.920\n What they were trying to do\n\n02:29.920 --> 02:32.640\n is they were intuitively trying to understand\n\n02:32.640 --> 02:36.980\n is there some kind of intuitive personal connection\n\n02:36.980 --> 02:40.360\n we have to something being the real world, right?\n\n02:40.360 --> 02:43.080\n And then the Matrix movie actually came out of these papers,\n\n02:43.080 --> 02:45.760\n and then these ideas made their way\n\n02:45.760 --> 02:47.940\n into the public consciousness.\n\n02:47.940 --> 02:50.480\n I personally think that if I had the choice\n\n02:50.480 --> 02:53.120\n to be in the digital world at the same fidelity\n\n02:53.120 --> 02:56.080\n as the real world with immortality,\n\n02:56.080 --> 02:57.560\n I would absolutely go with the digital.\n\n02:57.560 --> 02:58.640\n Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\n\n02:58.640 --> 03:00.440\n How'd you add the immortality part?\n\n03:00.440 --> 03:02.680\n That's a, you don't get immortality.\n\n03:02.680 --> 03:03.920\n If you think about how we would go\n\n03:03.920 --> 03:04.920\n into the digital world, right?\n\n03:04.920 --> 03:07.440\n Our brain patterns would be mapped\n\n03:07.440 --> 03:10.880\n onto some kind of probably virtual machine, right?\n\n03:10.880 --> 03:13.040\n And that would mean immortality, right?\n\n03:13.040 --> 03:15.220\n Because the virtual machine has no limit\n\n03:15.220 --> 03:16.060\n to how long it can exist.\n\n03:16.060 --> 03:18.480\n So don't you think there'll be like a versioning system?\n\n03:18.480 --> 03:22.040\n Like there'll be, this is a soft fork\n\n03:22.040 --> 03:23.740\n versus hard fork question.\n\n03:23.740 --> 03:27.160\n Whether Sergei version 2.0 would be different\n\n03:27.160 --> 03:30.600\n from Sergei version 1.0, there'll be an upgrade.\n\n03:30.600 --> 03:32.040\n So that's a mortality.\n\n03:32.040 --> 03:34.040\n Sergei 1.0 would die in the digital world.\n\n03:34.040 --> 03:38.060\n And you get like a software update, and then that's it.\n\n03:38.940 --> 03:41.340\n Well, yeah, when people go into the Star Trek transporter,\n\n03:41.340 --> 03:43.640\n are they killed or are they transported?\n\n03:43.640 --> 03:45.060\n I don't really know.\n\n03:45.060 --> 03:46.520\n I haven't written any papers on this.\n\n03:46.520 --> 03:48.040\n I haven't really thought about it too much.\n\n03:48.040 --> 03:50.040\n There's no white paper on the transporter.\n\n03:50.040 --> 03:51.240\n Not at this point, so.\n\n03:51.240 --> 03:53.720\n Well, what does fidelity mean exactly to you?\n\n03:53.720 --> 03:58.040\n Is it like strictly, so the fidelity of the physics world,\n\n03:58.040 --> 04:01.780\n the physical world is maybe now questions of physics,\n\n04:01.780 --> 04:05.320\n quantum mechanics, what is at the bottom of it all?\n\n04:05.320 --> 04:07.640\n Or do you mean the fidelity of the actual experience?\n\n04:07.640 --> 04:09.400\n Like the original state? It's just perception.\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:11.400\n It's just perception.\n\n04:11.400 --> 04:14.280\n But that's limited by human cognitive capabilities.\n\n04:14.280 --> 04:16.160\n It is, but I don't really have anything else, right?\n\n04:16.160 --> 04:17.280\n I think all of these papers\n\n04:17.280 --> 04:19.100\n that brought up these questions of assimilation,\n\n04:19.100 --> 04:21.600\n they were like in epistemology and metaphysics.\n\n04:21.600 --> 04:23.840\n And what they were trying to do, I think,\n\n04:23.840 --> 04:25.080\n was they were trying to put people\n\n04:25.080 --> 04:26.440\n through a thought experiment\n\n04:26.440 --> 04:28.840\n where they would come out on the other end\n\n04:28.840 --> 04:33.120\n and say the reality of life is really worth something.\n\n04:33.120 --> 04:36.140\n And I don't, you know, ignorance isn't bliss,\n\n04:36.140 --> 04:38.600\n which is that consistent statement in the matrix, right?\n\n04:38.600 --> 04:40.880\n Ignorance is bliss is that that's what one of the guys says\n\n04:40.880 --> 04:42.520\n when he's like, you know, doing something wrong\n\n04:42.520 --> 04:44.280\n and trying to get back into the matrix.\n\n04:44.280 --> 04:46.600\n And the question is, is ignorance bliss?\n\n04:47.720 --> 04:49.840\n And it's like a different version of that.\n\n04:49.840 --> 04:52.480\n I think from a perceptual point of view,\n\n04:52.480 --> 04:55.660\n if my perceptions aren't in any way different,\n\n04:55.660 --> 04:59.580\n so fidelity is very good, it doesn't matter.\n\n04:59.580 --> 05:00.960\n I don't know, right?\n\n05:00.960 --> 05:04.880\n So if I don't know something, it doesn't really exist.\n\n05:04.880 --> 05:07.800\n And if it doesn't exist in my perception\n\n05:07.800 --> 05:09.840\n or my consciousness, then it doesn't exist,\n\n05:09.840 --> 05:11.680\n period, for me, at least.\n\n05:11.680 --> 05:13.560\n And then whether it exists in some, you know,\n\n05:13.560 --> 05:16.380\n more metaphysical version of things,\n\n05:16.380 --> 05:18.800\n I personally never really got into the metaphysics stuff\n\n05:18.800 --> 05:20.300\n because I could never really,\n\n05:21.960 --> 05:24.920\n I couldn't understand what the point of it was, right?\n\n05:24.920 --> 05:27.840\n It's one of these things where I couldn't really get\n\n05:27.840 --> 05:32.320\n what the practical application of it was.\n\n05:32.320 --> 05:34.580\n And this is from those realm of questions, right?\n\n05:34.580 --> 05:37.040\n Like if there was something about the world,\n\n05:37.040 --> 05:39.820\n but you didn't have a capacity to perceive it,\n\n05:39.820 --> 05:41.760\n would it matter to you?\n\n05:41.760 --> 05:43.140\n To me, it wouldn't matter.\n\n05:43.140 --> 05:45.440\n Right, to me, by the way, the simulation thing\n\n05:45.440 --> 05:47.760\n is a really interesting engineering question,\n\n05:47.760 --> 05:52.760\n which is how difficult is it to engineer a virtual reality,\n\n05:53.140 --> 05:57.600\n a digital world that is sufficiently of high fidelity\n\n05:57.600 --> 05:59.080\n where you would want to live in it?\n\n05:59.080 --> 06:01.400\n I think that's a really testable\n\n06:01.400 --> 06:03.240\n and a fascinating engineering question.\n\n06:03.240 --> 06:04.440\n So my intuition says like,\n\n06:04.440 --> 06:06.540\n it's not as difficult as we think.\n\n06:06.540 --> 06:10.080\n It's not nearly as difficult as having to create\n\n06:10.080 --> 06:12.400\n a quantum mechanical simulation that's large enough\n\n06:12.400 --> 06:14.120\n to capture the full human experience.\n\n06:14.120 --> 06:15.880\n Like it might be just as simple\n\n06:15.880 --> 06:18.760\n as just a really nice quake game,\n\n06:19.760 --> 06:20.960\n like with a nice engine,\n\n06:20.960 --> 06:24.480\n with just creating all the basic visual elements\n\n06:24.480 --> 06:28.040\n that trick our cognitive, our visual cortex\n\n06:28.040 --> 06:29.540\n into believing that we're actually\n\n06:29.540 --> 06:31.720\n in the physical environment.\n\n06:31.720 --> 06:34.280\n And I think that if that's true,\n\n06:34.280 --> 06:38.440\n then that's quite a high fidelity digital world\n\n06:38.440 --> 06:41.620\n is actually achievable within a century.\n\n06:42.640 --> 06:44.860\n And that changes things.\n\n06:44.860 --> 06:47.000\n Yeah, yeah, maybe in our lifetime.\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:47.840\n I'm really hoping for that.\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:49.840\n I'm hoping somebody can copy my brainwaves\n\n06:49.840 --> 06:54.380\n onto a virtual machine and allow that consciousness\n\n06:54.380 --> 06:55.760\n to continue to exist.\n\n06:55.760 --> 06:59.040\n Whether that's death or not, I don't know.\n\n06:59.040 --> 07:03.360\n But I think it's actually gonna require some serious leaps.\n\n07:03.360 --> 07:05.580\n Like even the VR headsets, right?\n\n07:05.580 --> 07:09.440\n They don't work if they go below 90 frame rates, right?\n\n07:09.440 --> 07:11.200\n People start getting freaked out.\n\n07:11.200 --> 07:13.820\n So you have to go from one gaming screen\n\n07:13.820 --> 07:16.960\n of 60 frames per second\n\n07:16.960 --> 07:19.360\n to two screens of 90 frames per second.\n\n07:19.360 --> 07:22.280\n And so people's hardware today can't even handle that.\n\n07:22.280 --> 07:26.720\n And that's for these two little screens by your eyeballs.\n\n07:26.720 --> 07:30.200\n What it's gonna take to completely trick my consciousness\n\n07:30.200 --> 07:31.560\n into not knowing the difference\n\n07:31.560 --> 07:34.500\n in terms of like all the sensory inputs.\n\n07:36.040 --> 07:37.880\n I'm keeping my fingers crossed.\n\n07:37.880 --> 07:41.280\n Whoever does that and is close to doing that,\n\n07:41.280 --> 07:42.680\n they should contact me.\n\n07:42.680 --> 07:46.920\n I want to have my brainwaves turned into a virtual machine.\n\n07:46.920 --> 07:50.240\n Would you in that context, if Morpheus came to you,\n\n07:50.240 --> 07:53.500\n would you take the blue pill or the red pill?\n\n07:53.500 --> 07:58.280\n Meaning, would you be happy just living in that world\n\n07:58.280 --> 08:02.240\n and not knowing that you're living inside that virtual world\n\n08:02.240 --> 08:03.800\n that's running a computer?\n\n08:03.800 --> 08:06.640\n Or would you want to know the truth of it?\n\n08:06.640 --> 08:08.600\n Well, actually I think that's a very different question,\n\n08:08.600 --> 08:09.440\n right?\n\n08:09.440 --> 08:12.520\n There's a actually moral ethical question there\n\n08:12.520 --> 08:15.120\n about whether you should allow a bunch of people\n\n08:15.120 --> 08:17.960\n to get manipulated and killed and slaved,\n\n08:17.960 --> 08:20.200\n because in the matrix they're all enslaved\n\n08:20.200 --> 08:23.280\n as like a AAA battery\n\n08:23.280 --> 08:25.580\n to turn a human being into the battery, right?\n\n08:25.580 --> 08:30.580\n So I think the moral and ethical question of that,\n\n08:31.540 --> 08:33.100\n fascinating enough, isn't actually different\n\n08:33.100 --> 08:35.380\n than the moral and ethical questions we face today\n\n08:35.380 --> 08:36.940\n in modern daily life.\n\n08:36.940 --> 08:39.560\n But I probably have given the choice\n\n08:39.560 --> 08:43.460\n of just completely going along or going against it.\n\n08:43.460 --> 08:45.360\n I would probably go against it\n\n08:45.360 --> 08:48.020\n if I had to make this kind of binary choice.\n\n08:48.020 --> 08:50.000\n Because going along with it,\n\n08:50.000 --> 08:55.000\n I think at that scale of scary stuff happening to people\n\n08:56.840 --> 09:00.000\n is probably something really, really, really difficult.\n\n09:00.000 --> 09:01.200\n But for your individual life,\n\n09:01.200 --> 09:03.240\n it's way more fun to go along with it.\n\n09:03.240 --> 09:08.240\n So you're saying you value the opposing a system\n\n09:09.200 --> 09:11.760\n that includes the suffering of others\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:15.840\n versus just for yourself enjoying the ride.\n\n09:15.840 --> 09:19.400\n I mean, if there is such a binary choice,\n\n09:19.400 --> 09:21.900\n why choose to oppose the system?\n\n09:21.900 --> 09:24.440\n I think it's the nature of kind of the ethical dilemma\n\n09:24.440 --> 09:26.040\n that you face in that situation.\n\n09:26.040 --> 09:27.560\n There's kind of some,\n\n09:27.560 --> 09:29.880\n this is obviously not something that's happening now, right?\n\n09:29.880 --> 09:31.320\n We don't know this, right?\n\n09:31.320 --> 09:33.080\n No, we don't know this.\n\n09:33.080 --> 09:34.920\n At the end of the day,\n\n09:34.920 --> 09:38.080\n at that scale of something like that happening,\n\n09:38.080 --> 09:43.080\n yeah, that scale of people being manipulated and harmed,\n\n09:43.560 --> 09:45.760\n then I think pretty much almost all people\n\n09:45.760 --> 09:49.600\n have an obligation to go against it.\n\n09:49.600 --> 09:53.620\n Probably that's what that looks like in my opinion.\n\n09:53.620 --> 09:57.660\n So you've talked about the concept of definitive truth.\n\n09:57.660 --> 09:58.500\n What is it?\n\n09:58.500 --> 10:00.320\n And in general, what is the nature of truth\n\n10:00.320 --> 10:01.820\n in human civilization?\n\n10:01.820 --> 10:04.900\n And just talking about the digital age,\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:08.100\n the nature of truth in the digital age.\n\n10:09.360 --> 10:11.600\n So the interesting thing about definitive truth\n\n10:11.600 --> 10:14.800\n is that it actually exists on this,\n\n10:14.800 --> 10:16.840\n at least in my mind on this spectrum\n\n10:16.840 --> 10:21.320\n between objective truth and just somebody made something up\n\n10:21.320 --> 10:22.840\n and nobody else agrees.\n\n10:22.840 --> 10:25.000\n So what I think definitive truth is,\n\n10:25.000 --> 10:27.120\n is it's somewhere in the middle on that spectrum\n\n10:27.120 --> 10:31.880\n where if you and me define what truth is, right?\n\n10:31.880 --> 10:34.280\n Like if you and me have an agreement of some kind\n\n10:34.280 --> 10:38.620\n and we say, as long as the weather is sunny\n\n10:38.620 --> 10:41.640\n or the weather isn't, there is no rain on that day,\n\n10:41.640 --> 10:44.480\n then there'll be an insurance policy that results\n\n10:44.480 --> 10:47.920\n and you and me both agree that as long as three sensors,\n\n10:47.920 --> 10:51.520\n three weather monitoring stations all say that,\n\n10:51.520 --> 10:54.780\n then the definitive truth for us and for that agreement\n\n10:54.780 --> 10:59.520\n is the result of those systems coming to consensus\n\n10:59.520 --> 11:01.960\n about what happened out in the real world.\n\n11:01.960 --> 11:06.080\n I think the objective truth definition\n\n11:06.080 --> 11:08.160\n from kind of the philosophical world\n\n11:08.160 --> 11:12.160\n is really, really stringent and very, very hard to attain.\n\n11:12.160 --> 11:14.000\n And that's not what this is.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.280\n And that's actually not what commerce\n\n11:16.280 --> 11:20.180\n or the ability for people to interact about contracts needs.\n\n11:20.180 --> 11:23.980\n What I think the world of commerce needs is an upgrade\n\n11:23.980 --> 11:28.680\n from someone can unilaterally decide what the truth is\n\n11:28.680 --> 11:33.680\n to there can be a pre agreed set of conditions\n\n11:34.240 --> 11:37.920\n where we define what the truth is under those conditions.\n\n11:37.920 --> 11:40.620\n And then you and me basically say,\n\n11:40.620 --> 11:43.640\n if these 20 nodes or of these 30 data sources\n\n11:43.640 --> 11:46.440\n come to consensus within this method of consensus\n\n11:46.440 --> 11:48.280\n with this threshold of agreement,\n\n11:48.280 --> 11:51.240\n then definitive truth has been achieved for you and me\n\n11:51.240 --> 11:54.360\n in our relationship for this specific agreement\n\n11:54.360 --> 11:58.200\n and the specificity and our shared agreement\n\n11:58.200 --> 12:01.480\n to that kind of truth or that definitive truth\n\n12:01.480 --> 12:05.000\n being acceptable to both of us is probably\n\n12:05.000 --> 12:08.200\n what's kind of necessary and sufficient\n\n12:08.200 --> 12:10.600\n for everything to move forward in a better way.\n\n12:10.600 --> 12:12.640\n In any case, much better than,\n\n12:12.640 --> 12:14.440\n I'm a bank or an insurance company,\n\n12:14.440 --> 12:16.800\n I'm gonna unilaterally decide what happens.\n\n12:16.800 --> 12:18.720\n It's definitely an upgrade from that.\n\n12:18.720 --> 12:21.880\n Do you think it's possible to define formally in this way,\n\n12:21.880 --> 12:24.360\n a definitive truth for many things in this world?\n\n12:24.360 --> 12:26.240\n Like you talked about weather,\n\n12:26.240 --> 12:30.380\n basically defining that if three sensors of weather agree,\n\n12:30.380 --> 12:33.320\n then that we're going to agree that that is a definitive,\n\n12:33.320 --> 12:36.640\n useful truth for us to operate under.\n\n12:36.640 --> 12:39.360\n So how many things in this world\n\n12:39.360 --> 12:41.800\n can be formalized in this way, do you think?\n\n12:41.800 --> 12:43.240\n A huge amount.\n\n12:43.240 --> 12:48.240\n So there's actually two things going on here.\n\n12:48.480 --> 12:51.840\n One thing is the amount of data that already exists\n\n12:51.840 --> 12:55.400\n and the pieces of data coming off of markets,\n\n12:55.400 --> 12:59.200\n IOT, shipment of goods, any number of other things.\n\n12:59.200 --> 13:01.600\n Like even your YouTube channel has a certain amount\n\n13:01.600 --> 13:03.840\n of likes or a certain amount of clicks\n\n13:03.840 --> 13:05.200\n or a certain amount of views\n\n13:05.200 --> 13:06.560\n and even that's quantifiable.\n\n13:06.560 --> 13:08.980\n So even to a certain degree, what we do here today,\n\n13:08.980 --> 13:11.680\n you and me right now can be quantified\n\n13:11.680 --> 13:13.800\n as far as the amount of views, the amount of clicks,\n\n13:13.800 --> 13:14.640\n the amount of any number of other things.\n\n13:14.640 --> 13:18.320\n Yeah, you, the viewer, have power of data in your hands\n\n13:18.320 --> 13:20.660\n by clicking like or dislike right now\n\n13:20.660 --> 13:23.320\n or the subscribe button or the unsubscribe button,\n\n13:23.320 --> 13:24.940\n which I encourage you to do.\n\n13:24.940 --> 13:27.280\n Anyway, okay, so there's data flowing\n\n13:27.280 --> 13:30.280\n into all interactions in this world, there's data.\n\n13:30.280 --> 13:31.640\n There's more and more data, right?\n\n13:31.640 --> 13:32.480\n More and more data.\n\n13:32.480 --> 13:33.300\n More and more data.\n\n13:33.300 --> 13:36.420\n That data is more and more accessible to everybody\n\n13:36.420 --> 13:39.120\n and that accessibility and the fact that there's more of it\n\n13:39.120 --> 13:42.840\n means we can form more definitive truth proofs.\n\n13:42.840 --> 13:44.400\n We can form more and more proofs\n\n13:44.400 --> 13:47.520\n and as we form those proofs, well, we can provide them\n\n13:47.520 --> 13:49.880\n to these blockchains and smart contract systems\n\n13:49.880 --> 13:52.600\n that consume them and then they're tamper proof, right?\n\n13:52.600 --> 13:54.280\n So they can't be manipulated.\n\n13:54.280 --> 13:57.160\n And so now we've combined a system that can prove things\n\n13:57.160 --> 14:00.120\n with a system that guarantees a certain outcomes\n\n14:00.120 --> 14:02.440\n and we have a better system of contracts,\n\n14:02.440 --> 14:06.680\n which is actually an unbelievably powerful tool\n\n14:06.680 --> 14:08.560\n that has never existed before.\n\n14:08.560 --> 14:11.480\n Can we talk about the world of commerce and finance,\n\n14:11.480 --> 14:13.200\n decentralized finance?\n\n14:13.200 --> 14:16.480\n What is it, what's its promise\n\n14:16.480 --> 14:20.200\n from both the philosophical and technical perspective?\n\n14:20.200 --> 14:22.100\n If we just zoom in on that particular space\n\n14:22.100 --> 14:24.080\n of the digital world.\n\n14:24.080 --> 14:28.160\n Sure, so the decentralized finance is the instantiation\n\n14:28.160 --> 14:31.360\n of a specific type of smart contract, right?\n\n14:31.360 --> 14:33.680\n Or what I call hybrid smart contracts,\n\n14:33.680 --> 14:36.500\n which are these contracts that combine the on chain code\n\n14:36.500 --> 14:40.200\n together with the off chain proofs that something happened.\n\n14:40.200 --> 14:41.040\n They're called a hybrid\n\n14:41.040 --> 14:43.880\n because they basically use both of these systems, right?\n\n14:43.880 --> 14:47.040\n The blockchain and the proofs about what happened.\n\n14:47.040 --> 14:51.080\n And what DeFi is, is one specific type\n\n14:51.080 --> 14:53.680\n of hybrid smart contract that is taking\n\n14:53.680 --> 14:57.880\n on the contractual agreements you traditionally find\n\n14:57.880 --> 15:01.340\n in the global financial system, right?\n\n15:01.340 --> 15:04.400\n And that's basically the world of lending,\n\n15:04.400 --> 15:05.920\n the world of yield generation\n\n15:05.920 --> 15:08.800\n for people giving me or giving whoever their money\n\n15:08.800 --> 15:11.680\n and somebody giving back them yield back to them,\n\n15:11.680 --> 15:13.960\n which is what bonds do and what treasuries do\n\n15:13.960 --> 15:16.120\n and what a lot of the global financial markets do,\n\n15:16.120 --> 15:20.360\n as well as the ability to gain exposure and protection\n\n15:20.360 --> 15:23.000\n from different types of events and risks.\n\n15:23.000 --> 15:24.760\n That's a lot of what derivatives do, right?\n\n15:24.760 --> 15:27.520\n Derivatives allow us to say, hey, something's gonna happen.\n\n15:27.520 --> 15:29.520\n And I'm either gonna protect myself\n\n15:29.520 --> 15:31.040\n by getting paid if it happens,\n\n15:31.040 --> 15:33.280\n or I'm going to benefit from it happening\n\n15:33.280 --> 15:34.960\n by basically saying it's gonna happen,\n\n15:34.960 --> 15:36.120\n putting money down on that,\n\n15:36.120 --> 15:38.840\n and that prediction will get me a return.\n\n15:38.840 --> 15:41.640\n Now, that's a very large part\n\n15:41.640 --> 15:43.120\n of the global financial system,\n\n15:43.120 --> 15:45.100\n excluding all the stuff for global trade\n\n15:45.100 --> 15:46.480\n and letters of credit and all the stuff\n\n15:46.480 --> 15:48.320\n that facilitates international trade.\n\n15:48.320 --> 15:50.920\n So excluding that at least for now.\n\n15:50.920 --> 15:53.560\n So if we look at what decentralized finance does,\n\n15:53.560 --> 15:55.280\n it takes all of those agreements\n\n15:55.280 --> 15:57.420\n about generating yield, lending,\n\n15:57.420 --> 15:59.860\n and all of these types of things you find in global finance\n\n15:59.860 --> 16:01.180\n and the world of derivatives\n\n16:01.180 --> 16:04.080\n and a few other types of financial products.\n\n16:04.080 --> 16:07.960\n And it basically puts them into a different format, right?\n\n16:07.960 --> 16:11.700\n So the format you have for centralized financial agreements\n\n16:11.700 --> 16:13.360\n is that you go to a bank,\n\n16:13.360 --> 16:14.280\n even if you're a hedge fund,\n\n16:14.280 --> 16:15.920\n even if you're like the richest people,\n\n16:15.920 --> 16:18.600\n you go to a bank, they make a product for you,\n\n16:18.600 --> 16:20.180\n and you hope that they honor\n\n16:20.180 --> 16:21.760\n the product that they made for you.\n\n16:21.760 --> 16:23.420\n Or you do a deal with another hedge fund\n\n16:23.420 --> 16:25.580\n or whoever, some counterparty,\n\n16:25.580 --> 16:28.440\n and you hope that that deal is honored.\n\n16:28.440 --> 16:29.280\n Yep.\n\n16:29.280 --> 16:32.840\n And then a number of very freaky things start to take place.\n\n16:32.840 --> 16:36.700\n One of them is people don't have clarity\n\n16:36.700 --> 16:38.880\n about what the agreement is, right?\n\n16:38.880 --> 16:41.160\n So a lot of people don't know exactly\n\n16:41.160 --> 16:44.980\n what the agreement is between those parties\n\n16:44.980 --> 16:46.860\n because they can't actually see it.\n\n16:46.860 --> 16:48.860\n Sometimes agreements are kept very private\n\n16:48.860 --> 16:50.440\n or parts of them are kept private.\n\n16:50.440 --> 16:53.040\n And that keeps other counterparties,\n\n16:53.040 --> 16:53.880\n other people in the system\n\n16:53.880 --> 16:55.540\n from understanding what's going on.\n\n16:55.540 --> 16:56.960\n This is actually partly what happened\n\n16:56.960 --> 16:58.200\n with the mortgage crisis.\n\n16:58.200 --> 17:00.560\n The mortgage crisis in 2008 was basically,\n\n17:00.560 --> 17:02.720\n there were a lot of agreements, there were a lot of assets,\n\n17:02.720 --> 17:05.160\n but because the centralized financial system\n\n17:05.160 --> 17:07.000\n worked in such an opaque way,\n\n17:07.000 --> 17:08.600\n it was so unbelievably difficult\n\n17:08.600 --> 17:11.080\n to understand what was going on, right?\n\n17:11.080 --> 17:12.680\n And so that lack of understanding\n\n17:12.680 --> 17:13.840\n for the global financial system\n\n17:13.840 --> 17:15.400\n basically led to a big boom,\n\n17:15.400 --> 17:18.860\n and then correspondingly, very, very big bust,\n\n17:18.860 --> 17:21.280\n which amazingly enough had a huge impact on everybody,\n\n17:21.280 --> 17:22.480\n even though they didn't participate\n\n17:22.480 --> 17:25.360\n in the boom part of the equation.\n\n17:25.360 --> 17:28.680\n In any case, what decentralized finance does\n\n17:28.680 --> 17:31.520\n is it takes these financial contracts\n\n17:31.520 --> 17:33.320\n that power the global financial system,\n\n17:33.320 --> 17:36.240\n it puts them in this new blockchain based format\n\n17:36.240 --> 17:37.400\n that basically at this point\n\n17:37.400 --> 17:39.880\n provides three very powerful things.\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:42.380\n The first thing that it provides is complete transparency\n\n17:42.380 --> 17:45.340\n over what's going on with your financial product.\n\n17:45.340 --> 17:47.120\n So this means when you use a financial product\n\n17:47.120 --> 17:50.240\n in the DeFi format, you, and you as a technical person\n\n17:50.240 --> 17:53.240\n actually can drill down very, very, very deeply,\n\n17:53.240 --> 17:56.000\n and you can understand where the collateral is,\n\n17:56.000 --> 17:57.740\n you can understand how much collateral there is,\n\n17:57.740 --> 17:59.280\n you can understand what format it's in,\n\n17:59.280 --> 18:00.680\n you can understand how it's changing,\n\n18:00.680 --> 18:03.480\n you can understand this on a second to second\n\n18:03.480 --> 18:05.340\n or block to block basis, right?\n\n18:05.340 --> 18:07.840\n So you have complete transparency\n\n18:07.840 --> 18:11.160\n into what's going on in the financial protocol\n\n18:11.160 --> 18:12.840\n that you have your assets in,\n\n18:12.840 --> 18:15.680\n which is because blockchains and the infrastructure,\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:19.760\n all of these things are built on, force that transparency.\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:21.300\n Whereas the centralized financial system\n\n18:21.300 --> 18:23.480\n is very, very good at hiding it.\n\n18:23.480 --> 18:24.920\n It's very good at hiding it\n\n18:24.920 --> 18:27.840\n and packaging things in a glossy wrapper,\n\n18:27.840 --> 18:30.360\n creating a boom, then a bust.\n\n18:30.360 --> 18:32.600\n The centralized finance is built on infrastructure\n\n18:32.600 --> 18:35.880\n that forces transparency such that everyone can understand\n\n18:35.880 --> 18:38.120\n what the financial product does from day one.\n\n18:38.120 --> 18:41.760\n And in fact, escaping that property is practically impossible\n\n18:41.760 --> 18:43.400\n or if someone tries to escape it,\n\n18:43.400 --> 18:44.760\n it becomes immediately obvious\n\n18:44.760 --> 18:46.720\n and people don't use their financial product.\n\n18:46.720 --> 18:48.640\n So that's number one.\n\n18:48.640 --> 18:50.700\n Number two is control.\n\n18:50.700 --> 18:53.160\n So if you look at what happened with Robinhood,\n\n18:53.160 --> 18:55.560\n everybody thought the system worked a certain way, right?\n\n18:55.560 --> 18:57.760\n Everybody thought I have a brokerage account,\n\n18:57.760 --> 19:02.320\n I can trade things under a certain set of market conditions.\n\n19:02.320 --> 19:05.480\n And then the market conditions changed\n\n19:05.480 --> 19:08.280\n within the band of what people thought they could do.\n\n19:08.280 --> 19:10.320\n And everybody was fascinated to find out that,\n\n19:10.320 --> 19:13.440\n oh my God, I thought my band of market conditions\n\n19:13.440 --> 19:15.960\n in which I can control my assets is X,\n\n19:15.960 --> 19:17.520\n but it is actually Y,\n\n19:17.520 --> 19:20.480\n is actually much, much smaller band.\n\n19:20.480 --> 19:22.840\n And the reason it is a much, much smaller\n\n19:22.840 --> 19:24.460\n group of market conditions\n\n19:24.460 --> 19:26.800\n is that the system doesn't work\n\n19:26.800 --> 19:28.200\n the way people think it works.\n\n19:28.200 --> 19:30.320\n The system was wrapped up in a nice glossy wrapper\n\n19:30.320 --> 19:32.860\n and given to them to get them to participate in the system\n\n19:32.860 --> 19:35.840\n because the system requires and needs their participation.\n\n19:35.840 --> 19:39.520\n But if you actually look at how the system works underneath,\n\n19:39.520 --> 19:41.100\n you will see that it does not work\n\n19:41.100 --> 19:43.240\n the way people think that it works.\n\n19:43.240 --> 19:45.560\n And this is actually another reason that DeFi is so powerful\n\n19:45.560 --> 19:49.320\n because DeFi actually, and these blockchain contracts,\n\n19:49.320 --> 19:52.080\n give people the version of the world\n\n19:52.080 --> 19:54.100\n they think they already have,\n\n19:54.100 --> 19:56.520\n which is why they don't beg for it, right?\n\n19:56.520 --> 19:58.360\n So everybody thinks they're in a certain version\n\n19:58.360 --> 20:00.460\n of the world that works in this reliable way,\n\n20:00.460 --> 20:02.800\n transparent way, they're not.\n\n20:02.800 --> 20:04.000\n They don't realize it.\n\n20:04.000 --> 20:05.580\n And so they're confused when you tell them,\n\n20:05.580 --> 20:07.140\n I'm gonna make the world work this way\n\n20:07.140 --> 20:09.180\n because they think they're already in that world.\n\n20:09.180 --> 20:12.020\n But then things like Robinhood make it immediately,\n\n20:12.020 --> 20:14.020\n painfully clear that that's not how the world works\n\n20:14.020 --> 20:17.120\n so that the second real property of DeFi is control,\n\n20:17.120 --> 20:20.240\n which means that you control your assets,\n\n20:20.240 --> 20:23.880\n not a bank, not a broker, not a third party, you.\n\n20:23.880 --> 20:25.000\n You control your Bitcoins,\n\n20:25.000 --> 20:27.320\n you control your tokens in the finance protocol.\n\n20:27.320 --> 20:30.240\n If you don't like how something's going in that protocol,\n\n20:30.240 --> 20:32.820\n you can remove it, you can send it to another protocol,\n\n20:32.820 --> 20:34.480\n or you can use a feature of the protocol\n\n20:34.480 --> 20:36.020\n to do something it's supposed to do.\n\n20:36.020 --> 20:36.860\n And guess what?\n\n20:36.860 --> 20:38.900\n Nobody can just say, oops, that feature,\n\n20:38.900 --> 20:41.280\n that isn't so good for my friends over here.\n\n20:41.280 --> 20:42.520\n That feature is actually,\n\n20:42.520 --> 20:45.520\n we're just gonna pause that feature in the critical moment\n\n20:45.520 --> 20:49.480\n when you need it to execute your strategy,\n\n20:49.480 --> 20:52.120\n which is why you took all the risks to begin with.\n\n20:52.120 --> 20:56.520\n And then the final reason, the final thing to know about DeFi\n\n20:56.520 --> 20:59.200\n is that DeFi is inherently global,\n\n20:59.200 --> 21:02.960\n and actually right now provides better yield globally.\n\n21:02.960 --> 21:05.680\n So if you go to a bank right now with the US dollar,\n\n21:05.680 --> 21:07.840\n you get 1% or less.\n\n21:07.840 --> 21:12.760\n If you go to DeFi with the US dollar, you get 7% or 8%.\n\n21:12.760 --> 21:16.620\n So if we think about that in a world\n\n21:16.620 --> 21:19.120\n where there's a lot of inflation coming down the road,\n\n21:19.120 --> 21:24.120\n and we think about, well, a lot more systems\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:25.440\n might be failing soon,\n\n21:25.440 --> 21:28.280\n and they might be highlighting these types of problems\n\n21:28.280 --> 21:32.240\n that were there for, or as a result of the type of control\n\n21:32.240 --> 21:34.640\n that you see in Robinhood,\n\n21:34.640 --> 21:37.240\n and people are more and more concerned\n\n21:37.240 --> 21:39.960\n about both transparency and control,\n\n21:39.960 --> 21:43.040\n and they're looking for yield to combat inflation.\n\n21:43.040 --> 21:46.780\n I think that's what DeFi is about in a practical sense.\n\n21:46.780 --> 21:48.880\n It is this clarity about your risk.\n\n21:48.880 --> 21:51.360\n It is control over your assets.\n\n21:51.360 --> 21:53.620\n And amazingly, at the same time\n\n21:53.620 --> 21:56.800\n as having those two unbelievably useful properties,\n\n21:56.800 --> 21:59.240\n it is actually superior yield,\n\n21:59.240 --> 22:03.060\n which just leads me to the very obvious conclusion\n\n22:03.060 --> 22:05.920\n that the only reason DeFi is more used\n\n22:05.920 --> 22:08.260\n is because more people don't know about it.\n\n22:08.260 --> 22:12.040\n And by virtue of this long kind of explanation\n\n22:12.040 --> 22:14.920\n here and elsewhere, more people will know about it.\n\n22:14.920 --> 22:17.720\n And it's just such an obviously superior solution\n\n22:17.720 --> 22:20.960\n that I haven't heard a single explanation as to why.\n\n22:20.960 --> 22:24.160\n No, no, don't earn 8% and take less risk\n\n22:24.160 --> 22:26.660\n and have more transparency with your assets.\n\n22:27.560 --> 22:29.800\n Earn 7% less, take more risk,\n\n22:29.800 --> 22:32.640\n and give people the ability to change the rules on you\n\n22:32.640 --> 22:35.220\n at their discretion, go do that.\n\n22:36.200 --> 22:37.240\n Who's gonna do that?\n\n22:37.240 --> 22:40.440\n And in general, on the first two of transparency and control,\n\n22:40.440 --> 22:43.080\n first of all, I do think, maybe you can correct me,\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:47.800\n but from my perspective, they're deeply tied together\n\n22:47.800 --> 22:50.800\n in the sense that transparency gives control.\n\n22:50.800 --> 22:52.880\n Transparency creates accountability,\n\n22:52.880 --> 22:55.440\n and there's this kind of game being played,\n\n22:55.440 --> 22:58.320\n game theoretic game, where if I know,\n\n22:58.320 --> 23:00.640\n if you know I'm gonna discover your deviation,\n\n23:00.640 --> 23:02.280\n you're not gonna deviate.\n\n23:02.280 --> 23:04.800\n Yes, this could be a whole nother conversation,\n\n23:04.800 --> 23:06.600\n but just as a small aside,\n\n23:06.600 --> 23:08.600\n on the social network side of things,\n\n23:08.600 --> 23:13.480\n which I've been thinking deeply about in the past year or so,\n\n23:13.480 --> 23:18.360\n of how to do it right there, how to fix our social media.\n\n23:18.360 --> 23:22.820\n And I tend to believe that human beings,\n\n23:22.820 --> 23:25.240\n if they're given clear transparency\n\n23:25.240 --> 23:28.160\n about which data is being stored, how it's being used,\n\n23:28.160 --> 23:29.780\n where it's being moved about,\n\n23:29.780 --> 23:32.840\n just all a clear, simple transparency\n\n23:32.840 --> 23:36.420\n of how their data is being used,\n\n23:36.420 --> 23:40.720\n and them having the control at the very minimal level\n\n23:40.720 --> 23:43.840\n of being able to participate or to walk away,\n\n23:43.840 --> 23:45.920\n and walk away means delete everything\n\n23:45.920 --> 23:47.400\n you've ever known about me.\n\n23:48.640 --> 23:51.960\n That will create a much, much better world.\n\n23:51.960 --> 23:54.480\n That currently there's a complete lack of transparency\n\n23:54.480 --> 23:56.740\n on social media, how the data is being used\n\n23:56.740 --> 23:57.580\n for your own protection.\n\n23:57.580 --> 23:58.520\n I mean, there's a lot of parallels\n\n23:58.520 --> 24:00.480\n to the central bank situation,\n\n24:00.480 --> 24:02.640\n and there's not a control element\n\n24:02.640 --> 24:04.080\n of being able to walk away.\n\n24:04.080 --> 24:06.360\n Like being able to delete all your data,\n\n24:06.360 --> 24:09.420\n delete your account on Facebook is very difficult.\n\n24:09.420 --> 24:11.600\n It doesn't take a single click,\n\n24:11.600 --> 24:12.920\n which I think is what it should take.\n\n24:12.920 --> 24:15.020\n There should be a big red button that says,\n\n24:15.020 --> 24:17.400\n delete everything you've ever known about me,\n\n24:17.400 --> 24:19.240\n or like forget me.\n\n24:19.240 --> 24:21.700\n So I think that coupled together can create\n\n24:21.700 --> 24:24.880\n a very different kind of world and create\n\n24:24.880 --> 24:29.880\n an incentivization that will lead to like progress\n\n24:29.920 --> 24:32.680\n and innovation and just like a much better social network\n\n24:32.680 --> 24:37.680\n and a really good business for the future social networks.\n\n24:37.800 --> 24:42.160\n But so I tend to see like control as naturally\n\n24:43.440 --> 24:47.680\n being a sort of an outgrowth from the transparency.\n\n24:47.680 --> 24:49.520\n It should all start at the transparency,\n\n24:49.520 --> 24:54.000\n which is why the smart contract formulation is fascinating.\n\n24:54.000 --> 24:59.000\n Because like you're formalizing in a simple, clear way,\n\n24:59.160 --> 25:01.480\n any agreements that you're participating in.\n\n25:01.480 --> 25:05.640\n And as a side comment also, what's really inspiring to me\n\n25:05.640 --> 25:07.760\n is that I think there's a greater,\n\n25:07.760 --> 25:09.720\n I don't know if this is always the case,\n\n25:09.720 --> 25:12.480\n but it seems like from having talked to people\n\n25:12.480 --> 25:14.600\n on the psychological element,\n\n25:14.600 --> 25:19.600\n there's a hunger amongst people for transparency\n\n25:21.160 --> 25:23.240\n and for control.\n\n25:23.240 --> 25:26.200\n Like transparency, another word for that is authenticity.\n\n25:26.200 --> 25:29.520\n If you look at the kind of stuff that people hunger for now,\n\n25:29.520 --> 25:32.920\n they want to know the reality of who you are\n\n25:32.920 --> 25:33.760\n as an individual.\n\n25:33.760 --> 25:35.840\n So that means you can create businesses,\n\n25:35.840 --> 25:39.960\n you can create tools that are built on authenticity,\n\n25:39.960 --> 25:41.320\n a transparency.\n\n25:41.320 --> 25:45.880\n And then the same, I'm inspired by the intelligence\n\n25:45.880 --> 25:48.080\n of people, if you give them control,\n\n25:48.080 --> 25:52.760\n if you give them power, that they would make good choices.\n\n25:52.760 --> 25:54.040\n That's really exciting.\n\n25:54.040 --> 25:56.480\n Of course, not everybody, but that means that\n\n25:56.480 --> 26:01.480\n decentralized power can create effective systems.\n\n26:01.680 --> 26:03.840\n So couple that, there's a hunger for transparency\n\n26:03.840 --> 26:06.400\n so we can move to a world where everyone's being\n\n26:06.400 --> 26:10.920\n just like real, conveying their genuine human nature.\n\n26:10.920 --> 26:14.160\n And people are sufficiently intelligent\n\n26:14.160 --> 26:16.120\n that if they're given power\n\n26:16.120 --> 26:18.800\n in a distributed mass scale sense,\n\n26:18.800 --> 26:21.440\n that we're going to build a better world through that,\n\n26:21.440 --> 26:24.160\n as opposed to centralized supervised control\n\n26:24.160 --> 26:26.600\n or only a small percent of the population\n\n26:26.600 --> 26:27.600\n know what the hell they're doing.\n\n26:27.600 --> 26:29.720\n Everybody else is clueless sheep.\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:35.440\n So those two coupled together is really to me inspiring.\n\n26:35.440 --> 26:36.880\n Just to really quickly comment on this stuff\n\n26:36.880 --> 26:38.480\n that you just said, which I think is super,\n\n26:38.480 --> 26:40.440\n super, super fascinating.\n\n26:40.440 --> 26:42.760\n I think that's all exactly right.\n\n26:42.760 --> 26:44.720\n I think everything that you said is right.\n\n26:44.720 --> 26:46.080\n And I think it's actually going to be the same\n\n26:46.080 --> 26:47.960\n for social media and banking and every other type\n\n26:47.960 --> 26:51.160\n of contract, is that all of those systems\n\n26:51.160 --> 26:53.400\n that house people's value for them\n\n26:53.400 --> 26:56.760\n and take control of either their social media value\n\n26:56.760 --> 27:00.120\n or their financial value or whatever for them,\n\n27:00.120 --> 27:02.480\n all of that is going to be made available to people\n\n27:02.480 --> 27:05.200\n in like this autonomous piece of code\n\n27:05.200 --> 27:06.480\n that does the same thing\n\n27:06.480 --> 27:08.800\n that the centralized entity used to do.\n\n27:08.800 --> 27:10.760\n So they get all the features,\n\n27:10.760 --> 27:14.360\n but the autonomous piece of code gives them the ability\n\n27:14.360 --> 27:17.720\n to have control while getting all the features, right?\n\n27:17.720 --> 27:19.840\n So banks give you features,\n\n27:19.840 --> 27:22.520\n social media sites give you features,\n\n27:22.520 --> 27:24.480\n whatever other system that you use online\n\n27:24.480 --> 27:27.120\n gives you features, and then it takes your data\n\n27:27.120 --> 27:29.720\n and it takes control of your assets from you\n\n27:29.720 --> 27:32.240\n in return for those features, right?\n\n27:32.240 --> 27:34.520\n I think the whole big difference here,\n\n27:34.520 --> 27:37.040\n partly in line with the definition of smart contracts\n\n27:37.040 --> 27:39.200\n and its evolution is that there's this,\n\n27:39.200 --> 27:41.960\n now there's this autonomous piece of code\n\n27:41.960 --> 27:44.440\n that's giving you all those features\n\n27:44.440 --> 27:49.440\n without requiring the ownership and lock in and control\n\n27:49.440 --> 27:54.080\n and unilateral kind of ownership of your data\n\n27:54.080 --> 27:58.800\n or your value or whatever it is that you're giving it, right?\n\n27:58.800 --> 28:02.040\n And I think what this will lead to fundamentally\n\n28:02.040 --> 28:04.760\n is just more of a free market dynamic\n\n28:04.760 --> 28:07.120\n among how people make,\n\n28:07.120 --> 28:08.840\n I think with the social media folks,\n\n28:08.840 --> 28:11.720\n you should just make some kind of law or something\n\n28:11.720 --> 28:14.240\n where you can just export all your data from them,\n\n28:14.240 --> 28:16.960\n everyone should be able to get their data exported\n\n28:16.960 --> 28:18.680\n by another application,\n\n28:18.680 --> 28:21.520\n and then the network effect of all these social media sites\n\n28:21.520 --> 28:22.360\n will kind of crumble\n\n28:22.360 --> 28:24.840\n because people will just combine your Twitter data\n\n28:24.840 --> 28:27.000\n with your Facebook data, with everything else\n\n28:27.000 --> 28:29.040\n into an application that you control,\n\n28:29.040 --> 28:31.800\n and there'll just be thousands of different interfaces\n\n28:31.800 --> 28:34.680\n competing for how to consume all the social media data\n\n28:34.680 --> 28:35.960\n because it isn't locked in\n\n28:35.960 --> 28:38.400\n in one centralized actor's control.\n\n28:38.400 --> 28:40.880\n And so this is just the recurring pattern\n\n28:40.880 --> 28:42.600\n of what I think all of this will do\n\n28:42.600 --> 28:46.000\n is it'll give people, it gives people a better deal, right?\n\n28:46.000 --> 28:49.000\n It gives them features without ownership of data,\n\n28:49.000 --> 28:50.840\n without ownership of value,\n\n28:50.840 --> 28:53.640\n and that's really the difference.\n\n28:53.640 --> 28:54.920\n So I think this is a good place\n\n28:54.920 --> 28:56.560\n to talk about smart contracts then.\n\n28:56.560 --> 28:58.920\n Can you tell me the history of smart contracts\n\n28:58.920 --> 29:02.680\n and the basic sort of definitions of what is it?\n\n29:02.680 --> 29:05.880\n Sure, so I think smart contracts as a definition\n\n29:05.880 --> 29:08.240\n has actually gone through some kind of changes\n\n29:08.240 --> 29:10.000\n or small evolution.\n\n29:10.000 --> 29:12.240\n Initially, I think it was actually a conception\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:14.920\n of a digital agreement that was tamper proof\n\n29:14.920 --> 29:17.120\n and could know things about the world, right?\n\n29:17.120 --> 29:18.320\n So it could get proof\n\n29:18.320 --> 29:20.280\n and it could define that something happened\n\n29:20.280 --> 29:22.520\n and it could conclude an outcome\n\n29:22.520 --> 29:24.160\n and release payment or do something else.\n\n29:24.160 --> 29:26.360\n That's actually the definition of smart contracts\n\n29:26.360 --> 29:28.440\n that I began working in this industry with\n\n29:28.440 --> 29:29.560\n seven or eight years ago\n\n29:29.560 --> 29:31.520\n when I started making smart contracts.\n\n29:31.520 --> 29:34.920\n That is the conception that I had of a smart contract.\n\n29:34.920 --> 29:38.920\n Then what happened was that was really hard to do, right?\n\n29:38.920 --> 29:41.240\n Building that type of tamper proof digital agreement\n\n29:41.240 --> 29:43.680\n that could also know things about the real world\n\n29:43.680 --> 29:47.240\n and release payments back to people about those events\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:49.560\n that were codified in this tamper proof format\n\n29:49.560 --> 29:51.440\n was actually a very tall order.\n\n29:51.440 --> 29:53.080\n Turns out it's consistent of three parts.\n\n29:53.080 --> 29:54.600\n It's consisting of the contract,\n\n29:54.600 --> 29:55.760\n the proof about what happened\n\n29:55.760 --> 29:57.560\n and the release of value.\n\n29:58.440 --> 30:00.480\n The way things have evolved so far\n\n30:00.480 --> 30:05.480\n is that the definition has now come to mean on chain code.\n\n30:05.560 --> 30:08.440\n So it's come to mean the codification\n\n30:08.440 --> 30:11.680\n of contractual agreement on a blockchain, right?\n\n30:11.680 --> 30:14.120\n So there's some code somewhere on some blockchain\n\n30:14.120 --> 30:16.280\n that defines what the agreement is.\n\n30:17.600 --> 30:20.840\n Now that eliminates the part of the definition\n\n30:20.840 --> 30:23.160\n that's related to knowing things about the world\n\n30:23.160 --> 30:26.080\n and it partly eliminates the definition about payments\n\n30:26.080 --> 30:26.920\n and stuff like that.\n\n30:26.920 --> 30:30.560\n But basically it's on chain code, right?\n\n30:30.560 --> 30:34.000\n We in our recent work on a second white paper\n\n30:34.000 --> 30:36.160\n have actually put out a different definition\n\n30:36.160 --> 30:38.480\n that we call hybrid smart contracts\n\n30:38.480 --> 30:41.440\n that actually tries to go back to the initial definition\n\n30:41.440 --> 30:43.120\n that I started with seven or eight years ago,\n\n30:43.120 --> 30:47.160\n which basically says that there's some proof somewhere\n\n30:47.160 --> 30:48.440\n that's proven to the contract\n\n30:48.440 --> 30:49.880\n and the contract can know that\n\n30:49.880 --> 30:51.840\n and the contract can gain proof.\n\n30:51.840 --> 30:55.040\n Then it can use that proof to settle the agreement\n\n30:55.040 --> 30:57.520\n that's codified on a blockchain.\n\n30:57.520 --> 31:00.440\n So you both need a mechanism to provide proof.\n\n31:00.440 --> 31:02.720\n You need a mechanism to codify the contract\n\n31:02.720 --> 31:05.480\n in a tamper proof way on something like a blockchain.\n\n31:05.480 --> 31:06.880\n And then as with all contracts,\n\n31:06.880 --> 31:07.800\n there's a presumption that there's\n\n31:07.800 --> 31:09.480\n some kind of release of value.\n\n31:09.480 --> 31:13.280\n So I think a smart contract in our industry right now\n\n31:13.280 --> 31:15.040\n means on chain code,\n\n31:15.040 --> 31:19.040\n which limits it to whatever can be done on chain only.\n\n31:19.040 --> 31:22.240\n And then in our internal definition for us\n\n31:22.240 --> 31:24.480\n and for us at Chainlink and for me,\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:26.600\n it's hybrid smart contracts,\n\n31:26.600 --> 31:28.480\n which is actually the original definition.\n\n31:28.480 --> 31:32.520\n It's the idea that a contract can both know what happened\n\n31:32.520 --> 31:36.720\n and automatically resolve to the proper outcome\n\n31:36.720 --> 31:38.000\n based on what happened.\n\n31:38.000 --> 31:41.080\n So you're referring to the Chainlink 2.0 white paper,\n\n31:41.080 --> 31:45.640\n which is a paper that I recommend people look.\n\n31:45.640 --> 31:48.200\n It's a very easy read and very well structured\n\n31:48.200 --> 31:49.040\n and very thorough.\n\n31:49.040 --> 31:50.400\n So I really enjoyed it.\n\n31:50.400 --> 31:53.000\n Very recently released, I guess.\n\n31:53.000 --> 31:53.920\n Can you dig in deeper?\n\n31:53.920 --> 31:57.120\n What is a hybrid smart contract?\n\n31:57.120 --> 31:59.760\n You mentioned sort of this idea of data\n\n32:00.640 --> 32:05.640\n or knowing about the world and on chain and off chain.\n\n32:05.840 --> 32:07.680\n So what are the different roles in this?\n\n32:07.680 --> 32:10.600\n So hybrid, by the way, refers to the fact\n\n32:10.600 --> 32:13.960\n that it's on chain and off chain contracts.\n\n32:14.800 --> 32:18.560\n So maybe digging deeper of what the heck is it\n\n32:18.560 --> 32:21.640\n and what does it mean to know stuff about the world?\n\n32:21.640 --> 32:23.720\n Like how do you actually achieve that?\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:25.080\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n32:26.080 --> 32:30.520\n So the on chain part is where the agreement itself is.\n\n32:30.520 --> 32:32.960\n That's the smart contract itself.\n\n32:32.960 --> 32:35.040\n And that's where you codify certain conditions,\n\n32:35.040 --> 32:38.920\n such as the conditions under which an interest payment\n\n32:38.920 --> 32:41.760\n is made or the conditions under which the contract pays out\n\n32:41.760 --> 32:44.480\n the full amount that it holds to someone based\n\n32:44.480 --> 32:47.080\n on a derivative outcome or something like that.\n\n32:47.080 --> 32:49.120\n Now, what the on chain code is very good at\n\n32:49.120 --> 32:52.160\n is creating transparency about what the core conditions\n\n32:52.160 --> 32:53.920\n of the contract are.\n\n32:53.920 --> 32:57.120\n It's very good at taking in money from other private keys\n\n32:57.120 --> 33:00.800\n that send it tokens and send it value to hold.\n\n33:00.800 --> 33:03.680\n And then it's also very good at returning money\n\n33:03.680 --> 33:06.480\n or returning value back to other addresses\n\n33:06.480 --> 33:08.000\n or other private keys.\n\n33:08.000 --> 33:09.560\n It can also be involved in governance.\n\n33:09.560 --> 33:11.680\n It can be involved in a few other private key signature\n\n33:11.680 --> 33:14.400\n based operations.\n\n33:14.400 --> 33:18.160\n But primarily the on chain part of a hybrid smart contract,\n\n33:18.160 --> 33:21.360\n from what I've seen so far, defines the agreement,\n\n33:21.360 --> 33:24.840\n takes in value and returns value based upon the conditions\n\n33:24.840 --> 33:27.480\n codified in the agreement on a blockchain.\n\n33:27.480 --> 33:30.400\n The second and equally important off chain part\n\n33:30.400 --> 33:33.400\n is where the term oracle and an oracle comes in\n\n33:33.400 --> 33:36.640\n or an oracle mechanism or a decentralized oracle network\n\n33:36.640 --> 33:38.440\n as we describe it in the paper.\n\n33:38.440 --> 33:43.440\n And this is another decentralized computational system\n\n33:43.760 --> 33:45.280\n that has a different goal, right?\n\n33:45.280 --> 33:48.840\n So blockchains have the goal of packaging transactions\n\n33:48.840 --> 33:50.800\n into blocks and connecting them\n\n33:50.800 --> 33:54.480\n in a cryptographically unique way to create security\n\n33:54.480 --> 33:57.960\n and assurance about that chain of transactions.\n\n33:57.960 --> 34:01.680\n Oracles and decentralized oracle networks\n\n34:01.680 --> 34:06.320\n achieve consensus and they achieve decentralization\n\n34:06.320 --> 34:09.000\n about the topic of what happened, right?\n\n34:09.000 --> 34:11.520\n So blockchains structure transactions.\n\n34:11.520 --> 34:14.280\n Some of those transactions might be the state changes\n\n34:14.280 --> 34:16.960\n in different pieces of on chain code.\n\n34:16.960 --> 34:21.960\n And then those on chain pieces of code require input.\n\n34:23.320 --> 34:25.800\n I think the thing that people get kind of a little bit\n\n34:25.800 --> 34:29.840\n thrown by is despite being called smart contracts,\n\n34:29.840 --> 34:32.160\n the on chain code on a blockchain\n\n34:32.160 --> 34:35.560\n cannot actually speak to any other system.\n\n34:35.560 --> 34:38.400\n So blockchains are valuable and useful\n\n34:38.400 --> 34:40.720\n as far as they're tamper proof and secure.\n\n34:40.720 --> 34:42.200\n And to be tamper proof and secure,\n\n34:42.200 --> 34:44.160\n they're made this kind of walled garden\n\n34:44.160 --> 34:46.920\n that is able to know and interact\n\n34:46.920 --> 34:49.600\n only with the highly reliable information\n\n34:49.600 --> 34:51.800\n that's within that system,\n\n34:51.800 --> 34:56.240\n which is basically tokens and private key signatures.\n\n34:56.240 --> 34:59.320\n All the other world's information is not available\n\n34:59.320 --> 35:01.280\n in a blockchain inherently.\n\n35:01.280 --> 35:04.000\n And a smart contract or a piece of on chain code\n\n35:04.000 --> 35:06.520\n can't just say, hey, I'm gonna go get some data\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:09.800\n from over here because the API they would get it from\n\n35:09.800 --> 35:11.840\n creates a whole bunch of security concerns\n\n35:11.840 --> 35:13.440\n for the blockchain itself\n\n35:13.440 --> 35:14.960\n and a whole bunch of consensus issues\n\n35:14.960 --> 35:17.720\n about how to agree on what that API said\n\n35:17.720 --> 35:19.320\n or what the truth of the world is, right?\n\n35:19.320 --> 35:22.400\n Because it's not even agreeing on what one API said,\n\n35:22.400 --> 35:25.360\n it's more so creating a reliable\n\n35:25.360 --> 35:27.440\n form of decentralized computation\n\n35:27.440 --> 35:30.040\n that can give you a definitive proof of what happened\n\n35:30.040 --> 35:31.840\n and not just what one API said.\n\n35:31.840 --> 35:34.520\n So for example, some of our most widely used networks\n\n35:34.520 --> 35:37.480\n have well over 30 nodes and well over 10 data sources\n\n35:37.480 --> 35:38.960\n that are all providing information\n\n35:38.960 --> 35:40.640\n about the same type of data.\n\n35:40.640 --> 35:43.960\n And then there's consensus on that one piece of data,\n\n35:43.960 --> 35:46.400\n which is then written in and essentially given back\n\n35:46.400 --> 35:49.880\n into the on chain code to tell it what happened\n\n35:49.880 --> 35:52.240\n because you can't really make an agreement\n\n35:52.240 --> 35:54.320\n unless you know what happened, right?\n\n35:54.320 --> 35:55.680\n If you and me were to make an agreement\n\n35:55.680 --> 35:57.400\n and set some contractual conditions,\n\n35:57.400 --> 35:59.920\n but our agreement could never know what happened,\n\n35:59.920 --> 36:02.640\n it would be completely useless.\n\n36:02.640 --> 36:04.400\n However, if you and me made an agreement\n\n36:04.400 --> 36:06.600\n and there was another system called an Oracle mechanism\n\n36:06.600 --> 36:08.000\n or decentralized Oracle network\n\n36:08.000 --> 36:10.600\n that proved what happened definitively\n\n36:10.600 --> 36:12.000\n and you and me pre agreed\n\n36:12.000 --> 36:15.120\n that whatever this mechanism says is what happened,\n\n36:15.120 --> 36:18.800\n then we can achieve an entirely new level of automation.\n\n36:18.800 --> 36:22.200\n We can suddenly say, there's this piece of on chain code\n\n36:22.200 --> 36:23.520\n that's highly reliable.\n\n36:23.520 --> 36:25.600\n We can give it millions, billions,\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:27.880\n eventually trillions of dollars in value.\n\n36:27.880 --> 36:30.840\n And it is controlled by this other system over here\n\n36:30.840 --> 36:32.600\n that's also highly reliable\n\n36:32.600 --> 36:35.040\n under this configurable set of definitive truth\n\n36:35.040 --> 36:36.520\n and decentralization conditions,\n\n36:36.520 --> 36:39.480\n which we all agree are sufficiently stringent\n\n36:39.480 --> 36:41.360\n to control that much value.\n\n36:41.360 --> 36:42.880\n And therefore the combination\n\n36:42.880 --> 36:46.240\n of this tamper proof on chain representation of a contract\n\n36:46.240 --> 36:50.200\n and this mutually agreed upon definition\n\n36:50.200 --> 36:54.640\n of a trigger or a proof system combined\n\n36:54.640 --> 36:56.760\n is a hybrid smart contract,\n\n36:56.760 --> 36:59.320\n which as you can see probably already\n\n36:59.320 --> 37:03.880\n does a lot more than just a contract on chain, right?\n\n37:03.880 --> 37:05.640\n Can you talk about this consensus mechanism,\n\n37:05.640 --> 37:07.560\n which by the way is just fascinating.\n\n37:07.560 --> 37:11.480\n So there's the on chain consensus mechanism\n\n37:11.480 --> 37:14.600\n of proof of work and proof of stake.\n\n37:14.600 --> 37:19.600\n And then there is this Oracle network consensus mechanism\n\n37:20.680 --> 37:22.560\n of what is true.\n\n37:23.960 --> 37:26.960\n So how do you, can you compare the two?\n\n37:26.960 --> 37:28.840\n Like how do you achieve that kind of consensus?\n\n37:28.840 --> 37:30.880\n How do you achieve security\n\n37:30.880 --> 37:35.520\n in integrating data about the world\n\n37:35.520 --> 37:39.240\n in a way that's definitively true\n\n37:39.240 --> 37:41.200\n in a way that is usefully true,\n\n37:41.200 --> 37:44.480\n such that we can rely on it in making major agreements\n\n37:44.480 --> 37:48.280\n that as you said, involve billions of trillions of dollars.\n\n37:49.160 --> 37:50.440\n Right, so this is the challenging,\n\n37:50.440 --> 37:51.880\n this is the challenging question, right?\n\n37:51.880 --> 37:56.520\n This is the challenging problem that Oracle networks,\n\n37:56.520 --> 37:59.640\n Oracles, we at Chainlink that we work on\n\n37:59.640 --> 38:01.800\n in order to create this definitive truth\n\n38:01.800 --> 38:04.360\n to trigger and create hyper automation\n\n38:04.360 --> 38:06.640\n in this more advanced form,\n\n38:06.640 --> 38:09.240\n more advanced form of hybrid smart contracts.\n\n38:09.240 --> 38:12.400\n The reality I think of this problem\n\n38:12.400 --> 38:16.520\n is that it is very specific to each use case.\n\n38:16.520 --> 38:20.760\n And it, and this is actually how we've architected our system\n\n38:20.760 --> 38:22.760\n is in a very flexible way.\n\n38:22.760 --> 38:27.240\n So for example, you need an ability for an Oracle network\n\n38:27.240 --> 38:30.320\n to grow in the amount of nodes that it has\n\n38:30.320 --> 38:33.200\n relative to the value it secures, right?\n\n38:33.200 --> 38:34.960\n So if you have an Oracle network\n\n38:34.960 --> 38:37.240\n that secures a hundred thousand dollars\n\n38:37.240 --> 38:40.080\n in like a beta of a financial product,\n\n38:40.080 --> 38:42.640\n maybe it can be fine with only seven nodes\n\n38:42.640 --> 38:44.440\n and only two or three data sources, right?\n\n38:44.440 --> 38:47.120\n Because the risk to that Oracle network\n\n38:47.120 --> 38:49.520\n is relatively low based on the value it secures.\n\n38:50.960 --> 38:53.160\n So the first question is actually\n\n38:53.160 --> 38:57.960\n how do you scale security relative to value\n\n38:57.960 --> 38:59.480\n secured by that Oracle network?\n\n38:59.480 --> 39:00.800\n Because it wouldn't be very efficient\n\n39:00.800 --> 39:05.800\n to have a thousand nodes securing $100,000 worth of value.\n\n39:05.800 --> 39:08.720\n So one of the first questions is how do we properly scale\n\n39:08.720 --> 39:12.040\n and how do we compose ensembles of nodes\n\n39:12.040 --> 39:14.840\n in a decentralized way where we can know that,\n\n39:14.840 --> 39:17.320\n okay, we're going from seven nodes in a network\n\n39:17.320 --> 39:22.320\n to 15, to 31, to 57, to 105, to a thousand, right?\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:25.800\n So that's one dimension of the problem.\n\n39:25.800 --> 39:27.440\n So you have to be scaling the number of nodes\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:31.120\n relative to the value that's derived\n\n39:31.120 --> 39:34.280\n from the truth integrated into those nodes.\n\n39:34.280 --> 39:36.240\n Well, that's not the only problem, right?\n\n39:36.240 --> 39:38.760\n The other side of this is that you're trying to create\n\n39:38.760 --> 39:42.040\n a deterministic result, a deterministic output\n\n39:42.040 --> 39:44.400\n from a set of non deterministic disparate systems,\n\n39:44.400 --> 39:47.040\n data sources, or places that prove things.\n\n39:47.040 --> 39:51.080\n Can you also, just as an aside, what is an Oracle node?\n\n39:51.080 --> 39:53.480\n What is the role of an Oracle node?\n\n39:53.480 --> 39:58.200\n Sure, so an Oracle node essentially exists in both places,\n\n39:58.200 --> 40:00.120\n it exists in both worlds.\n\n40:00.120 --> 40:02.760\n It exists as an on chain contract\n\n40:02.760 --> 40:07.440\n that represents either an Oracle network or an Oracle node.\n\n40:07.440 --> 40:10.400\n So there's an on chain interface in the form of a contract\n\n40:10.400 --> 40:15.080\n that says, I exist to give you this list of inputs.\n\n40:15.080 --> 40:16.920\n You can request weather data from me,\n\n40:16.920 --> 40:18.960\n you can request price data from me,\n\n40:18.960 --> 40:20.520\n you can ask me to send a payment somewhere.\n\n40:20.520 --> 40:24.480\n So it's like an API, so it's a pointer to a API\n\n40:24.480 --> 40:28.880\n that provides truth about this world.\n\n40:28.880 --> 40:31.320\n It's an interface, so just like an API\n\n40:31.320 --> 40:33.800\n is an interface for Web 2.0 engineers,\n\n40:35.480 --> 40:39.480\n Oracle networks and the contracts that represent them\n\n40:39.480 --> 40:42.480\n or individual nodes are the interface\n\n40:42.480 --> 40:45.560\n of Web 3.0's use of services.\n\n40:45.560 --> 40:48.600\n And services includes all services,\n\n40:48.600 --> 40:52.560\n data, payment systems, messaging systems,\n\n40:52.560 --> 40:56.200\n whatever Web 2.0 or any kind of computing service\n\n40:56.200 --> 40:58.240\n that you can conceptualize,\n\n40:58.240 --> 41:01.680\n needs an interface on chain in the form of a contract\n\n41:01.680 --> 41:04.800\n that says, here are the services I can provide for you,\n\n41:04.800 --> 41:07.280\n here are the transactions you need to send me\n\n41:07.280 --> 41:11.240\n to get back this data or that computation or this result.\n\n41:11.240 --> 41:12.360\n And then what you actually see\n\n41:12.360 --> 41:14.000\n is that decentralized Oracle networks,\n\n41:14.000 --> 41:16.960\n because they're uniquely capable of generating\n\n41:16.960 --> 41:19.760\n their own computations in a decentralized way\n\n41:19.760 --> 41:22.400\n around the data that they have access to,\n\n41:22.400 --> 41:24.760\n you actually see decentralized Oracle networks\n\n41:24.760 --> 41:26.360\n generating a lot of these services.\n\n41:26.360 --> 41:29.440\n So for example, we have a randomness service,\n\n41:29.440 --> 41:32.080\n a verifiable randomness function service\n\n41:32.080 --> 41:35.040\n that basically provides randomness on chain\n\n41:35.880 --> 41:38.160\n and that randomness is then used in lotteries\n\n41:38.160 --> 41:40.240\n and various other contracts that need randomness.\n\n41:40.240 --> 41:42.400\n But that randomness, it's not a piece of data\n\n41:42.400 --> 41:43.680\n that comes from somewhere else.\n\n41:43.680 --> 41:46.560\n We don't go to another data source and get it.\n\n41:46.560 --> 41:49.000\n We generate it within an Oracle node\n\n41:49.000 --> 41:52.120\n that then provides it over into Oracle node\n\n41:52.120 --> 41:53.280\n or Oracle nodes that provide it\n\n41:53.280 --> 41:55.160\n into the contracts themselves.\n\n41:55.160 --> 41:57.760\n So why do you say Oracle nodes are non deterministic?\n\n41:58.760 --> 42:01.080\n Well, they are as far as they come to consensus,\n\n42:01.080 --> 42:05.720\n but there's this kind of different problem here, right?\n\n42:05.720 --> 42:08.160\n The blockchains are very focused\n\n42:08.160 --> 42:10.720\n on generating blocks of transactions\n\n42:10.720 --> 42:13.600\n within a smaller universe of transaction types,\n\n42:13.600 --> 42:16.880\n a certain block size and a certain set of conditions.\n\n42:16.880 --> 42:20.640\n And then they have a economic system that says,\n\n42:20.640 --> 42:23.280\n I will perpetually generate blocks of this size\n\n42:23.280 --> 42:26.120\n with these transaction types in this kind of limited set\n\n42:26.120 --> 42:29.240\n of transaction types, whether those are UTXO transactions\n\n42:29.240 --> 42:31.840\n or scripted solidity or whatever it is.\n\n42:32.920 --> 42:35.360\n Oracles and Oracle networks,\n\n42:35.360 --> 42:36.840\n we don't have a blockchain, for example.\n\n42:36.840 --> 42:38.680\n There is no chain link blockchain.\n\n42:38.680 --> 42:41.920\n Our goal is not to generate a certain set\n\n42:41.920 --> 42:45.240\n of very clearly predetermined transaction types\n\n42:45.240 --> 42:48.120\n into a set of transactions that are put into blocks\n\n42:48.120 --> 42:50.720\n and it will infinitely be done that way.\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:54.840\n Our goal is actually to create what we call a Meta layer,\n\n42:54.840 --> 42:58.840\n a decentralized Meta layer between the non deterministic,\n\n42:58.840 --> 43:01.720\n highly unreliable world\n\n43:01.720 --> 43:05.760\n and the highly hyper reliable world of blockchains\n\n43:05.760 --> 43:08.480\n so that the unreliable world can be passed\n\n43:08.480 --> 43:10.120\n through this decentralized Meta layer.\n\n43:10.120 --> 43:13.920\n And it can coexist with a reliable on chain world.\n\n43:13.920 --> 43:15.960\n Exactly, it can coexist and in some cases,\n\n43:15.960 --> 43:17.800\n the Meta layer might generate it.\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:20.240\n So the problem in giving you this straight answer\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:24.160\n is that there's just such a wide array of services.\n\n43:24.160 --> 43:25.000\n If you were to say,\n\n43:25.000 --> 43:27.840\n well, Sergey, how do we generate randomness\n\n43:27.840 --> 43:28.840\n from a data source?\n\n43:28.840 --> 43:31.280\n Well, we don't use a data source to generate the randomness.\n\n43:31.280 --> 43:33.160\n That's the type of service that can be generated\n\n43:33.160 --> 43:35.200\n in an Oracle network itself.\n\n43:35.200 --> 43:37.120\n And so there'll be certain computations\n\n43:37.120 --> 43:40.240\n that Oracle networks themselves generate themselves\n\n43:40.240 --> 43:43.000\n to augment and improve blockchains.\n\n43:43.000 --> 43:44.600\n And it is actually the goal of Oracles\n\n43:44.600 --> 43:45.720\n to consistently do that.\n\n43:45.720 --> 43:48.280\n So if you were to think about the stack\n\n43:48.280 --> 43:50.200\n in a very generic high level,\n\n43:50.200 --> 43:52.400\n you would see blockchains or databases.\n\n43:52.400 --> 43:53.720\n They're basically the data structures\n\n43:53.720 --> 43:55.800\n that retain a lot of information\n\n43:55.800 --> 43:58.400\n in this transparent, highly reliable form.\n\n43:58.400 --> 44:01.880\n Smart contract code is the application logic.\n\n44:01.880 --> 44:04.240\n It is the logic under which all of this\n\n44:04.240 --> 44:06.320\n kind of activity occurs,\n\n44:06.320 --> 44:09.480\n storing data in the data structure in the blockchain\n\n44:09.480 --> 44:13.720\n as a database in a certain conceptualization of it.\n\n44:13.720 --> 44:15.760\n And then Oracles and Oracle networks\n\n44:15.760 --> 44:20.760\n are all the services that are used by the application code.\n\n44:20.840 --> 44:23.360\n So, you know, by analogy, let's take Uber.\n\n44:23.360 --> 44:27.800\n Uber initially, some core code goes and gets the GPS API\n\n44:27.800 --> 44:30.000\n from Google Maps about the user's location,\n\n44:30.000 --> 44:32.280\n sends a message to the user through Twilio,\n\n44:32.280 --> 44:33.840\n pays the driver through Stripe.\n\n44:34.720 --> 44:36.760\n If those services weren't available\n\n44:36.760 --> 44:38.280\n to the people who made Uber,\n\n44:38.280 --> 44:39.680\n they wouldn't have made Uber, right?\n\n44:39.680 --> 44:41.120\n Because they would have written their core code\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.280\n on some database,\n\n44:42.280 --> 44:44.720\n and then they would have had to make a geolocation company,\n\n44:44.720 --> 44:46.680\n a telecom messaging company,\n\n44:46.680 --> 44:48.320\n and the global payments company.\n\n44:48.320 --> 44:50.600\n And they wouldn't have done that because it's too hard.\n\n44:50.600 --> 44:52.360\n And that's the weird scenario\n\n44:52.360 --> 44:54.400\n that a lot of people in our industry are in.\n\n44:54.400 --> 44:57.920\n And that's the problem that Oracles and Oracle networks fix\n\n44:57.920 --> 45:00.920\n is they provide these decentralized services\n\n45:00.920 --> 45:03.840\n to take this developer ecosystem,\n\n45:03.840 --> 45:06.800\n the blockchain and smart contract developer ecosystem\n\n45:06.800 --> 45:09.480\n from, hey, I can have a database\n\n45:09.480 --> 45:11.040\n and write some application logic\n\n45:11.040 --> 45:14.160\n about tokenization and voting and private key signing,\n\n45:14.160 --> 45:17.400\n all of which is super useful and is a critical foundation.\n\n45:17.400 --> 45:20.880\n But now, if you just layer on all the world's services,\n\n45:20.880 --> 45:23.680\n whether that's market data, weather data, randomness,\n\n45:23.680 --> 45:26.880\n suddenly people can build DeFi, fraud proof gaming,\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:30.320\n fraud proof global trade, fraud proof ad networks.\n\n45:30.320 --> 45:33.760\n And that's why this world of decentralized services\n\n45:33.760 --> 45:35.440\n and decentralized Oracle networks\n\n45:35.440 --> 45:38.880\n is particularly, in my opinion, important to our industry.\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:39.720\n Yeah, it's funny.\n\n45:39.720 --> 45:42.840\n And you talk about the currents of a decentralized world,\n\n45:42.840 --> 45:44.200\n decentralized world, DeFi,\n\n45:44.200 --> 45:48.160\n but decentralized services world is primarily just tokens.\n\n45:48.160 --> 45:51.880\n And it's basically just financial transactions.\n\n45:51.880 --> 45:55.480\n And the kind of thing, the reason why it's super exciting,\n\n45:55.480 --> 45:58.160\n the kind of thing you do with Chainlink and Oracle networks\n\n45:58.160 --> 46:00.120\n is that you can basically open up\n\n46:00.120 --> 46:01.560\n the whole world of services\n\n46:02.920 --> 46:07.920\n to this kind of decentralized smart contract world.\n\n46:07.920 --> 46:12.920\n I mean, you're talking about just orders of magnitude\n\n46:14.360 --> 46:16.080\n greater impact financially\n\n46:16.080 --> 46:20.440\n and just socially and philosophically.\n\n46:21.600 --> 46:23.360\n Are there interesting near term\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:26.000\n and long term applications that excite you?\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:27.720\n Yeah, there's a lot that excites me.\n\n46:27.720 --> 46:28.920\n And that is how I think about it,\n\n46:28.920 --> 46:29.880\n that it's not just about\n\n46:29.880 --> 46:31.880\n we made a decentralized Oracle network.\n\n46:31.880 --> 46:34.120\n It's about we made a decentralized service\n\n46:34.120 --> 46:35.400\n or collection of services\n\n46:35.400 --> 46:37.600\n that's going from hundreds to thousands.\n\n46:37.600 --> 46:39.000\n And then people are able to build\n\n46:39.000 --> 46:40.440\n the hybrid smart contracts,\n\n46:40.440 --> 46:43.200\n which I think will redefine what our industry is about.\n\n46:43.200 --> 46:44.480\n Because for example, for the people\n\n46:44.480 --> 46:45.960\n that only learned about blockchains\n\n46:45.960 --> 46:48.080\n through the lens of NFTs,\n\n46:48.080 --> 46:50.360\n they understand blockchains through NFTs,\n\n46:50.360 --> 46:53.120\n not through speculative tokens or Bitcoins, right?\n\n46:53.120 --> 46:55.800\n And I think that will continue.\n\n46:55.800 --> 46:58.280\n I think the use cases that excite me,\n\n46:58.280 --> 47:01.000\n they vary between the developed market,\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:04.440\n the developed world's economies and emerging markets.\n\n47:04.440 --> 47:06.200\n I think in the developed world,\n\n47:06.200 --> 47:09.160\n what you will see is that transparency,\n\n47:09.160 --> 47:12.840\n creating a new level of information\n\n47:12.840 --> 47:16.480\n for how markets work and the risk that is in markets\n\n47:16.480 --> 47:19.640\n and kind of the dynamics that put\n\n47:19.640 --> 47:20.960\n the global financial system\n\n47:20.960 --> 47:23.600\n at systemic financial risk like 2008.\n\n47:23.600 --> 47:25.880\n And my hope is that all of this infrastructure\n\n47:25.880 --> 47:29.960\n will soften the boom and bust cycles\n\n47:29.960 --> 47:32.280\n by making information immediately available\n\n47:32.280 --> 47:34.000\n to all market participants,\n\n47:34.000 --> 47:36.680\n which is by the way, what all market participants want,\n\n47:36.680 --> 47:39.280\n except for the very, very, very small minority\n\n47:39.280 --> 47:41.760\n that are able to game the system and their benefit\n\n47:41.760 --> 47:43.640\n and benefit from booms but avoid busts\n\n47:43.640 --> 47:46.160\n because of their asymmetric access to information,\n\n47:46.160 --> 47:47.680\n which really everybody should have\n\n47:47.680 --> 47:49.800\n and which this technically solves.\n\n47:49.800 --> 47:51.720\n I think in the process of doing that\n\n47:51.720 --> 47:54.320\n and which is happening, I think right about now,\n\n47:54.320 --> 47:56.640\n you see a polishing of the technology\n\n47:56.640 --> 47:59.680\n such that it can be made available to emerging markets.\n\n47:59.680 --> 48:00.960\n And on a personal level,\n\n48:00.960 --> 48:04.800\n I feel that the emerging markets will benefit much more\n\n48:04.800 --> 48:06.120\n from this technology,\n\n48:06.120 --> 48:08.360\n just like the emerging markets benefit much more\n\n48:08.360 --> 48:12.440\n from the internet or from those $50 Android phones\n\n48:12.440 --> 48:13.760\n that people can have,\n\n48:13.760 --> 48:15.960\n because it's such a massive shift\n\n48:15.960 --> 48:17.920\n in how people's lives work, right?\n\n48:17.920 --> 48:20.320\n I have always had access to books and a library,\n\n48:20.320 --> 48:23.200\n which has been fantastic and very important.\n\n48:23.200 --> 48:24.520\n But there are places in the world\n\n48:24.520 --> 48:26.480\n where people don't have libraries,\n\n48:26.480 --> 48:29.920\n but now they have the internet and a $50 Android phone\n\n48:29.920 --> 48:32.960\n and they can watch the same Stanford lecture that I watch.\n\n48:32.960 --> 48:35.760\n I mean, that's kind of mind blowing realistically, right?\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:38.560\n They just went from zero to one in a very,\n\n48:38.560 --> 48:40.280\n very dramatic way.\n\n48:40.280 --> 48:43.400\n I think all of these smart contracts,\n\n48:43.400 --> 48:45.040\n and in my case, I think the one\n\n48:45.040 --> 48:48.360\n that I seem to keep coming back to is crop insurance,\n\n48:48.360 --> 48:49.840\n where partly because it doesn't have\n\n48:49.840 --> 48:50.960\n a tokenization component,\n\n48:50.960 --> 48:52.520\n partly because it's actually much more important\n\n48:52.520 --> 48:54.280\n than it might seem.\n\n48:55.920 --> 48:57.760\n What is crop insurance?\n\n48:57.760 --> 49:02.760\n Right, so this is the nature of why it's sometimes hard\n\n49:03.320 --> 49:05.200\n to see the full value of what our industry does,\n\n49:05.200 --> 49:07.360\n because it solves all these kinds of backend problems\n\n49:07.360 --> 49:08.400\n that we don't have, right?\n\n49:08.400 --> 49:12.520\n So crop insurance is if I own a farm and it doesn't rain,\n\n49:12.520 --> 49:14.160\n I get an insurance payout,\n\n49:14.160 --> 49:16.280\n so I don't need to close down my farm,\n\n49:16.280 --> 49:19.560\n because if it didn't rain, I don't have crops, right?\n\n49:19.560 --> 49:23.680\n So people in the developed world can get crop insurance\n\n49:23.680 --> 49:25.520\n and there's all kinds of systems\n\n49:25.520 --> 49:26.680\n that basically pay them out,\n\n49:26.680 --> 49:29.440\n and then they can argue with the insurance company\n\n49:29.440 --> 49:31.840\n if they don't get paid out properly and whatever.\n\n49:31.840 --> 49:35.960\n And this allows people to smooth out risk.\n\n49:35.960 --> 49:39.040\n In fact, a lot of the global options markets\n\n49:39.040 --> 49:40.200\n were about this, right?\n\n49:40.200 --> 49:43.360\n They were initially about people selling their produce\n\n49:43.360 --> 49:45.200\n or their crops ahead of time,\n\n49:45.200 --> 49:47.280\n so that if there was a risk of drought,\n\n49:47.280 --> 49:49.640\n they weren't impacted by it, right?\n\n49:49.640 --> 49:51.360\n And that's where a lot of options trading\n\n49:51.360 --> 49:53.680\n and all this kind of stuff came from,\n\n49:53.680 --> 49:57.040\n even though it's now turned into this kind of global casino.\n\n49:57.040 --> 49:58.960\n But in the emerging market,\n\n49:58.960 --> 50:01.280\n there are literally people that,\n\n50:01.280 --> 50:03.520\n if they don't have rain for two seasons,\n\n50:03.520 --> 50:04.880\n they need to close down their farm\n\n50:04.880 --> 50:07.240\n and become a migrant worker of some kind.\n\n50:07.240 --> 50:10.160\n And now they have a $50 Android phone\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:12.120\n where they can read Wikipedia,\n\n50:12.120 --> 50:15.400\n but they're still decades away from an insurance company\n\n50:15.400 --> 50:18.280\n coming to their geography and offering them insurance\n\n50:18.280 --> 50:20.560\n because their local legal system simply doesn't allow\n\n50:20.560 --> 50:22.040\n that type of thing to exist.\n\n50:22.040 --> 50:25.040\n No insurance company is gonna go and create insurance entity\n\n50:25.040 --> 50:27.680\n and offer them insurance because the levels of fraud\n\n50:27.680 --> 50:29.640\n and the ability to resolve that fraud through courts\n\n50:29.640 --> 50:31.280\n would just not exist.\n\n50:31.280 --> 50:34.160\n So now these people have to wait for decades\n\n50:34.160 --> 50:37.160\n to have this very basic form of financial protection\n\n50:37.160 --> 50:39.520\n or something like a bank account even.\n\n50:39.520 --> 50:42.000\n And with this technology, they don't, right?\n\n50:42.000 --> 50:45.560\n So with this technology, if I have a $50 Android phone\n\n50:45.560 --> 50:48.840\n and the smart contract has data from satellites\n\n50:48.840 --> 50:51.200\n or weather stations about the weather conditions\n\n50:51.200 --> 50:53.480\n in the geography that my farm is in,\n\n50:53.480 --> 50:57.320\n I can put value into the smart contract\n\n50:57.320 --> 51:00.720\n and the smart contract will automatically pay me out back,\n\n51:00.720 --> 51:02.720\n pay me back out at my Android phone.\n\n51:02.720 --> 51:04.120\n And guess what?\n\n51:04.120 --> 51:07.680\n I just leapfrogged past my corrupt government\n\n51:07.680 --> 51:10.800\n not being able to provide a legal infrastructure\n\n51:10.800 --> 51:12.320\n to create insurance.\n\n51:12.320 --> 51:15.080\n I just leapfrogged past dealing with insurance companies\n\n51:15.080 --> 51:19.520\n that'll probably price gouge me and often not pay out.\n\n51:19.520 --> 51:23.520\n And I leapfrogged into the world of hyper reliable\n\n51:24.640 --> 51:27.560\n kind of guaranteed smart contract outcomes\n\n51:27.560 --> 51:29.480\n that are as good or in many cases better\n\n51:29.480 --> 51:31.440\n than what farmers in all parts of other parts\n\n51:31.440 --> 51:32.720\n of the world have.\n\n51:32.720 --> 51:35.160\n And this type of dynamic for the emerging markets\n\n51:35.160 --> 51:37.960\n of creating a way for people to control and manage risk\n\n51:37.960 --> 51:41.200\n in their economic life, I think extends way past insurance.\n\n51:41.200 --> 51:42.800\n It extends to them having bank accounts\n\n51:42.800 --> 51:44.360\n to combat local inflation.\n\n51:44.360 --> 51:46.680\n It extends to them being able to sell their goods\n\n51:46.680 --> 51:50.200\n on the free market of global trade without middlemen.\n\n51:50.200 --> 51:51.320\n It extends to all these things\n\n51:51.320 --> 51:53.120\n that we don't really care about, right?\n\n51:53.120 --> 51:54.840\n Because we're not farmers,\n\n51:54.840 --> 51:57.920\n but are unbelievably impactful for people\n\n51:57.920 --> 51:59.480\n that don't have a bank account\n\n51:59.480 --> 52:03.320\n and their inflation rate in their country is double digits\n\n52:03.320 --> 52:06.040\n or their farm completely depends on rain\n\n52:06.040 --> 52:07.800\n or their livelihood completely depends\n\n52:07.800 --> 52:10.120\n on their ability to sell goods.\n\n52:10.120 --> 52:12.720\n And they can't sell those goods because there's a middleman\n\n52:12.720 --> 52:16.160\n who essentially controls all the trust relationships.\n\n52:16.160 --> 52:18.640\n But now we have the internet and smart contracts\n\n52:18.640 --> 52:20.800\n and that might not have to be the case\n\n52:20.800 --> 52:22.480\n in the next five or 10 years.\n\n52:22.480 --> 52:25.560\n Yeah, so that definitely has a quality of life impact\n\n52:25.560 --> 52:27.040\n on the particular farmer's life,\n\n52:27.040 --> 52:32.040\n but I suspect it has a huge like down the line ripple effect\n\n52:32.600 --> 52:33.920\n on the whole supply chain.\n\n52:33.920 --> 52:36.160\n So if you think about farmers,\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:41.160\n but any other people that produce things\n\n52:41.160 --> 52:46.160\n that are part of a large like logistics network,\n\n52:46.800 --> 52:48.920\n like supply chain network,\n\n52:48.920 --> 52:52.520\n that means when you increase reliability,\n\n52:52.520 --> 52:57.520\n you sort of increase transparency and control,\n\n52:57.520 --> 53:01.880\n but like where any one node in that supply chain network\n\n53:01.880 --> 53:06.280\n can formalize the way it operates\n\n53:06.280 --> 53:08.640\n in its agreements with others,\n\n53:08.640 --> 53:13.640\n then you could just have a very like at scale\n\n53:13.840 --> 53:18.840\n transformative effect on how people that down the line\n\n53:18.960 --> 53:20.880\n use the services that you provide,\n\n53:20.880 --> 53:23.240\n the products that you create operate.\n\n53:23.240 --> 53:26.720\n So like, it's almost hard to imagine\n\n53:27.680 --> 53:30.520\n the possible ways it might transform the world.\n\n53:30.520 --> 53:33.160\n I wonder how much friction there is in the system,\n\n53:33.160 --> 53:37.520\n I guess, currently that smart contracts might remove.\n\n53:37.520 --> 53:40.680\n That's almost unknown.\n\n53:40.680 --> 53:44.440\n You can sort of hypothesize and stuff, but I wonder.\n\n53:44.440 --> 53:47.840\n I've seen enough bureaucracy in my life\n\n53:47.840 --> 53:50.400\n to know that smart contracts in many cases\n\n53:50.400 --> 53:52.560\n would remove bureaucracy.\n\n53:52.560 --> 53:55.600\n And I wonder how the world will be\n\n53:55.600 --> 53:58.320\n once you remove much of the bureaucracy.\n\n53:58.320 --> 54:00.120\n Coming from the Soviet Union,\n\n54:00.120 --> 54:05.120\n where I just have seen the life sucked out\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:10.120\n of the innovative spirit of human nature by bureaucracy.\n\n54:11.280 --> 54:14.880\n I wonder, the kind of amazing world that could be created\n\n54:14.880 --> 54:16.440\n once bureaucracy is removed.\n\n54:17.920 --> 54:22.280\n Yeah, I think it's fascinating how the world can evolve.\n\n54:22.280 --> 54:25.280\n I think this extends a lot further than people think\n\n54:25.280 --> 54:28.040\n into many, many different parts of the global economy.\n\n54:28.040 --> 54:30.880\n It might start with NFTs for art,\n\n54:30.880 --> 54:33.280\n or it might start with DeFi, right?\n\n54:33.280 --> 54:36.600\n Or it might start with fraud proof ad networks next.\n\n54:36.600 --> 54:39.320\n We don't know what it's gonna go to next,\n\n54:39.320 --> 54:42.440\n but I think the implication of people being\n\n54:42.440 --> 54:46.360\n in a system of contracts that holds them accountable\n\n54:46.360 --> 54:48.960\n and guarantees contractual outcomes,\n\n54:48.960 --> 54:51.240\n regardless of a local legal system,\n\n54:51.240 --> 54:53.960\n is something that I think extends to the supply chain.\n\n54:53.960 --> 54:57.720\n You can prove that goods were sourced in an ethical way,\n\n54:57.720 --> 55:00.200\n and you can prove that in a way that can't be gamed.\n\n55:00.200 --> 55:03.480\n That'll change buying power and supplier power\n\n55:03.480 --> 55:06.760\n and how people produce goods that we all consume.\n\n55:06.760 --> 55:08.840\n And then on the political level,\n\n55:08.840 --> 55:11.760\n I personally think that in a number of decades,\n\n55:11.760 --> 55:13.560\n we could literally be in a place\n\n55:13.560 --> 55:16.000\n where politicians can commit\n\n55:16.000 --> 55:20.360\n to a certain set of smart contract kind of budget,\n\n55:20.360 --> 55:22.280\n definitional kind of results.\n\n55:22.280 --> 55:24.560\n For example, we discovered oil.\n\n55:24.560 --> 55:26.840\n I promise as a politician, I'm gonna take the oil\n\n55:26.840 --> 55:29.200\n and I'm gonna redistribute it to all of you.\n\n55:29.200 --> 55:30.440\n Well, that's wonderful.\n\n55:30.440 --> 55:31.640\n That's a great idea.\n\n55:31.640 --> 55:34.240\n Sounds very nice when you're running for office.\n\n55:34.240 --> 55:36.760\n Why don't we codify that in a smart contract?\n\n55:36.760 --> 55:38.760\n And why don't we put those conditions\n\n55:38.760 --> 55:40.680\n very solidly on a blockchain?\n\n55:40.680 --> 55:44.040\n And then once you've been elected,\n\n55:44.040 --> 55:45.760\n we'll just turn that one on\n\n55:45.760 --> 55:48.880\n and it'll distribute the money just like you said,\n\n55:48.880 --> 55:50.520\n and everything will be fine.\n\n55:50.520 --> 55:53.880\n I personally think that this new level of systems\n\n55:53.880 --> 55:57.160\n that allows trustworthy collaboration between everybody,\n\n55:57.160 --> 55:59.680\n between supply chain partners, ad network users,\n\n55:59.680 --> 56:04.080\n the financial system, insurance companies, and farmers,\n\n56:04.080 --> 56:06.480\n all of these are just interactions\n\n56:06.480 --> 56:09.520\n that require a trusted entity,\n\n56:09.520 --> 56:12.200\n or in this case, a trusted piece of code\n\n56:12.200 --> 56:14.440\n to orchestrate the interaction\n\n56:14.440 --> 56:17.440\n in the way that everyone agrees.\n\n56:17.440 --> 56:20.200\n Yeah, one of the things that makes the United States\n\n56:20.200 --> 56:23.080\n fascinating is the founding documents.\n\n56:23.080 --> 56:26.000\n And it's fascinating to think of us moving into the new\n\n56:26.000 --> 56:30.240\n in the 21st century to a digital version of that.\n\n56:30.240 --> 56:33.280\n So the constitution, a smart constitution,\n\n56:33.280 --> 56:35.960\n no offense to the paper constitution,\n\n56:37.080 --> 56:39.800\n and that would have transformative effects\n\n56:39.800 --> 56:42.160\n on politicians and governments,\n\n56:43.200 --> 56:45.640\n holding people accountable.\n\n56:45.640 --> 56:50.560\n Oh man, that's so exciting to think that\n\n56:50.560 --> 56:55.560\n we might enforce accountability\n\n56:58.200 --> 57:00.920\n through the smart contract process.\n\n57:00.920 --> 57:02.640\n Exactly, why can't that happen?\n\n57:02.640 --> 57:05.680\n Anything that we could codify into a smart contract,\n\n57:05.680 --> 57:07.160\n and anything that we all agree\n\n57:07.160 --> 57:09.120\n is the way the world should work.\n\n57:09.120 --> 57:12.280\n And then anything that we can get proof about, right?\n\n57:12.280 --> 57:15.800\n Anything that a system somewhere could tell us happened,\n\n57:15.800 --> 57:19.040\n those are the pieces of the puzzle, right?\n\n57:19.040 --> 57:21.120\n We need a trusted piece of code,\n\n57:21.120 --> 57:23.040\n we need to have agreement\n\n57:23.040 --> 57:24.560\n that that's how the world should work,\n\n57:24.560 --> 57:26.760\n and we need a system that'll tell that trusted piece\n\n57:26.760 --> 57:28.480\n of code what happened.\n\n57:28.480 --> 57:30.760\n As long as we have those three things,\n\n57:30.760 --> 57:34.040\n we can theoretically codify any set of agreements\n\n57:34.040 --> 57:39.040\n about anything where those three properties take hold.\n\n57:39.800 --> 57:40.920\n I wonder if you could apply that\n\n57:40.920 --> 57:43.760\n to like military conflict and so on.\n\n57:43.760 --> 57:48.080\n Recently, Biden announced that we're going to pull off\n\n57:48.080 --> 57:52.480\n from Afghanistan after 20 years in the war.\n\n57:52.480 --> 57:57.480\n I wonder, there's a lot of debacles around war in Afghanistan\n\n57:58.600 --> 58:00.960\n and invasion of Iraq, all those kinds of things.\n\n58:00.960 --> 58:04.720\n I wonder if that was instead formulated as a smart contract.\n\n58:06.280 --> 58:11.000\n Like that might have actually huge impact\n\n58:11.000 --> 58:12.640\n on the way we do conflict.\n\n58:12.640 --> 58:15.360\n So you think of the smart contract\n\n58:15.360 --> 58:18.720\n as a kind of win win situation where you're doing\n\n58:18.720 --> 58:21.520\n like financial transactions or something like that.\n\n58:21.520 --> 58:25.320\n But you could see that also about military conflict\n\n58:25.320 --> 58:30.040\n or like whenever two nations are at tension with each other,\n\n58:30.040 --> 58:32.000\n different scales of conflict,\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:35.200\n that you can have conflict codified.\n\n58:36.800 --> 58:40.920\n And that would potentially resolve conflict much faster\n\n58:40.920 --> 58:43.360\n because there's honesty, transparency and control\n\n58:43.360 --> 58:46.160\n within that conflict, because there's conflict in this world.\n\n58:46.160 --> 58:49.800\n And I, again, very, very inspiring to think\n\n58:49.800 --> 58:52.880\n about the kind of effects it might have\n\n58:52.880 --> 58:56.360\n on the negative kinds of contracts,\n\n58:56.360 --> 58:59.560\n on the tense, painful kinds of contracts.\n\n58:59.560 --> 59:01.240\n I haven't thought about that as much.\n\n59:01.240 --> 59:02.200\n It's actually kind of scary,\n\n59:02.200 --> 59:04.000\n the stuff you're thinking through now\n\n59:04.000 --> 59:06.240\n with like the war contracts or something.\n\n59:06.240 --> 59:07.360\n That's not in the white paper.\n\n59:07.360 --> 59:09.560\n We don't have anything about war contracts or anything.\n\n59:09.560 --> 59:12.520\n Again, this is the Russian, we're both Russian,\n\n59:12.520 --> 59:15.280\n but I'm a little more Russian in the suffering side.\n\n59:15.280 --> 59:17.200\n Maybe I read way too much Dostoevsky\n\n59:17.200 --> 59:19.400\n and military kind of ideas.\n\n59:19.400 --> 59:24.400\n But anyway, holding politicians accountable in all forms,\n\n59:24.960 --> 59:26.160\n I think is really powerful.\n\n59:26.160 --> 59:29.200\n Is there something you could say as a small aside\n\n59:29.200 --> 59:33.520\n on how smart contracts actually work if we look at the code?\n\n59:33.520 --> 59:37.160\n Is there some nice way to say technically\n\n59:37.160 --> 59:39.000\n what is a smart contract?\n\n59:39.000 --> 59:41.640\n What does it mean to codify these agreements,\n\n59:41.640 --> 59:42.920\n the actual process for people\n\n59:42.920 --> 59:44.560\n who might not at all be familiar?\n\n59:46.480 --> 59:48.640\n I think you just write it into code\n\n59:48.640 --> 59:52.560\n that operates in this kind of decentralized infrastructure.\n\n59:52.560 --> 59:54.160\n You usually write code\n\n59:54.160 --> 59:56.160\n that runs in a central server somewhere.\n\n59:56.160 --> 59:58.800\n Now you write code that runs across a lot\n\n59:58.800 --> 1:00:01.440\n of different machines in this decentralized way.\n\n1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:04.480\n And then after you write it, you need services.\n\n1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:05.580\n And that's where oracles come in,\n\n1:00:05.580 --> 1:00:07.200\n they provide all the services.\n\n1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:10.360\n So just like you would be writing code in web 2.0 land,\n\n1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:11.560\n running it on a server somewhere\n\n1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:14.880\n and using an API, here you'd be writing code,\n\n1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.640\n putting it on a decentralized infrastructure\n\n1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:20.120\n like a blockchain or a smart contract platform like Ethereum.\n\n1:00:20.120 --> 1:00:22.640\n And then you would be using various services\n\n1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.640\n in the form of oracles.\n\n1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:24.940\n So they'll just be called oracles\n\n1:00:24.940 --> 1:00:27.400\n or decentralized services instead of APIs.\n\n1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:31.120\n And you're basically composing the same type of architecture\n\n1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:33.120\n except it's hyper reliable.\n\n1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:34.760\n At the moment, it's a little bit less efficient\n\n1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:39.160\n because there's an early stage to our industry.\n\n1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:43.200\n But it provides this extreme level of reliability\n\n1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:46.240\n and transparency, which for certain use cases\n\n1:00:46.240 --> 1:00:48.720\n is an absolute critical component\n\n1:00:48.720 --> 1:00:50.840\n and is completely reinventing how they work.\n\n1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:53.920\n So I think people should look at what are the use cases\n\n1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:56.520\n where that trust dynamic can be so heavily improved.\n\n1:00:56.520 --> 1:00:57.720\n And that's probably the ones\n\n1:00:57.720 --> 1:00:59.560\n where this is maybe initially useful.\n\n1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:01.680\n But I mean, just to emphasize,\n\n1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.360\n I don't think people realize when you say code\n\n1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.240\n that we're talking about non obfuscated actual program.\n\n1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:11.960\n Like you can read it, you can understand it.\n\n1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:14.100\n And there's something about,\n\n1:01:15.140 --> 1:01:17.320\n maybe this is my computer science perspective\n\n1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:19.640\n of like software engineering perspective,\n\n1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.320\n but there's something about the formalism\n\n1:01:21.320 --> 1:01:26.320\n of programming languages, which enforces simplicity\n\n1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:28.040\n and clarity and transparency.\n\n1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:31.960\n And because it's seen to everybody,\n\n1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:34.080\n I mean, simplicity is enforced.\n\n1:01:34.080 --> 1:01:36.600\n There's something about natural language,\n\n1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:40.780\n like language as written in the constitution, for example,\n\n1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:43.220\n where there's so many interpretations.\n\n1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:47.580\n With the nice thing about programs,\n\n1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:51.120\n there's not going to be a huge number of books written\n\n1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:54.160\n about what was meant by this particular line\n\n1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:55.540\n because it's pretty clear.\n\n1:01:56.400 --> 1:01:58.880\n Like programming languages have a clarity to them\n\n1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:01.460\n that natural language does not,\n\n1:02:01.460 --> 1:02:06.120\n and they don't have ambiguity, which I think it's important\n\n1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.260\n to pause on because it's really powerful.\n\n1:02:08.260 --> 1:02:09.920\n It's really difficult to think about.\n\n1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:12.320\n I think we live in a world where all the philosophers\n\n1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:15.360\n and legal minds don't know how to program.\n\n1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:18.560\n So I think, not all, most don't.\n\n1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:22.800\n And so we don't often see the philosophical impact\n\n1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:25.200\n of this kind of idea that the agreements\n\n1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:30.040\n between humans can be written in a programming language.\n\n1:02:30.040 --> 1:02:32.760\n That's a really transformative idea.\n\n1:02:32.760 --> 1:02:37.760\n That, I mean, yeah, it's an idea that's not just technical.\n\n1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:39.560\n It's not just financial.\n\n1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.000\n It's philosophical.\n\n1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:44.400\n It's rethinking human nature from a digital perspective.\n\n1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:48.100\n Like what is human civilization?\n\n1:02:48.100 --> 1:02:49.780\n It's interaction between humans.\n\n1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:55.840\n And rethinking that interaction as a digital interaction\n\n1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:58.100\n that is managed by programming languages,\n\n1:02:58.100 --> 1:03:00.840\n by programs, by code.\n\n1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:03.320\n I mean, that's fascinating.\n\n1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:05.760\n That we'll look back at this time potentially\n\n1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:10.120\n as one where us little descendants of apes\n\n1:03:10.120 --> 1:03:15.120\n did not realize how important this moment in history is.\n\n1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.560\n Like human beings might be totally different\n\n1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.640\n a century from now because we codified\n\n1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.840\n the interaction between humans.\n\n1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:28.760\n That might have more of an impact than anything else\n\n1:03:28.760 --> 1:03:30.360\n we do today.\n\n1:03:30.360 --> 1:03:31.760\n You think about the impact of the internet,\n\n1:03:31.760 --> 1:03:35.020\n one of the cool things is digitization of data.\n\n1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:38.100\n But we have not yet integrated the tools,\n\n1:03:38.100 --> 1:03:42.320\n the mechanisms fully that use that data\n\n1:03:42.320 --> 1:03:43.840\n and interact with humans yet.\n\n1:03:43.840 --> 1:03:45.840\n And that's what smart contracts do.\n\n1:03:45.840 --> 1:03:47.600\n I wonder if you think about the role\n\n1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:50.200\n of artificial intelligence in all of this.\n\n1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:56.200\n Because your smart contracts are kind of agreements,\n\n1:03:56.380 --> 1:03:57.600\n maybe you disagree with this,\n\n1:03:57.600 --> 1:03:59.880\n but at least the way I'm thinking about it\n\n1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:03.920\n is agreements between humans or groups of humans.\n\n1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:07.220\n But it seems like because everything's operating\n\n1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:10.600\n in the digital space that you can integrate\n\n1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:12.960\n non humans into this.\n\n1:04:12.960 --> 1:04:16.180\n Or AI systems that help out humans,\n\n1:04:16.180 --> 1:04:17.600\n managed by humans.\n\n1:04:17.600 --> 1:04:20.960\n Like what do you think about a world\n\n1:04:20.960 --> 1:04:23.120\n of hybrid smart contracts,\n\n1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:30.480\n codifying agreements between hybrid\n\n1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:34.760\n intelligent being networks of humans and AI systems?\n\n1:04:35.620 --> 1:04:39.080\n Yeah, I think that makes perfect sense.\n\n1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.300\n In terms of AI, I'm not an expert, right?\n\n1:04:42.300 --> 1:04:45.320\n So it might be a bit simplistic or naive,\n\n1:04:45.320 --> 1:04:48.400\n my ideas in this field.\n\n1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:51.760\n I think everyone saw the Terminator movie, right?\n\n1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.000\n Everybody kind of saw the Terminator movie in the 90s.\n\n1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.520\n And it was like, this is really scary.\n\n1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:02.160\n I personally think AI is amazing and makes perfect sense.\n\n1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:06.400\n I think it will evolve to a place where people have...\n\n1:05:06.400 --> 1:05:07.240\n Just to understand,\n\n1:05:07.240 --> 1:05:09.460\n I work in the world of trust issues, right?\n\n1:05:09.460 --> 1:05:12.980\n I work in the world of how can technology solve trust\n\n1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:16.080\n and collaboration issues using encryption,\n\n1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:18.280\n using cryptographically guaranteed systems,\n\n1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:20.040\n using decentralized infrastructure, right?\n\n1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:22.240\n So that's the world that I've been inhabiting\n\n1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:24.800\n for many, many years now,\n\n1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:26.480\n building smart contracts for seven or eight,\n\n1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:27.520\n doing stuff before that.\n\n1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:29.360\n It's kind of what I'm focused on.\n\n1:05:29.360 --> 1:05:32.920\n So I view AI through that same lens.\n\n1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:34.280\n And my brain naturally asks,\n\n1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:35.900\n well, what is the trust issue\n\n1:05:35.900 --> 1:05:37.920\n that people might have with AI?\n\n1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:40.600\n And my natural kind of response is,\n\n1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:44.840\n well, let's say AI continues to be built and improve.\n\n1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:48.000\n At some point, I have no clue where we are on this now.\n\n1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.040\n I've seen different ideas that were very far from this.\n\n1:05:51.040 --> 1:05:52.840\n I've seen other ideas were very close to this.\n\n1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:55.480\n At a certain point, we'd arrive at a place with AI\n\n1:05:55.480 --> 1:05:57.840\n where we would be a little bit worried\n\n1:05:57.840 --> 1:05:59.600\n about just how much it could do, right?\n\n1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:02.180\n We might be worried that AI could do things\n\n1:06:02.180 --> 1:06:04.240\n we don't want it to do,\n\n1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:06.320\n but we still want to give AI\n\n1:06:06.320 --> 1:06:08.600\n a level of control over our lives, right?\n\n1:06:08.600 --> 1:06:11.680\n So in my world, that's a trust issue.\n\n1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:13.160\n And the way that that trust issue\n\n1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:15.000\n would be solved with blockchains\n\n1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:16.840\n is actually very straightforward.\n\n1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:19.780\n And I think in its simplicity, quite powerful.\n\n1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:23.420\n You could have an AI that has an ability to do\n\n1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:28.420\n and control key parts of your and our lives, right?\n\n1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:32.040\n But then you could limit it with private keys\n\n1:06:32.040 --> 1:06:35.800\n and blockchains and create certain guardrails\n\n1:06:35.800 --> 1:06:40.800\n and firm kind of walls and limits\n\n1:06:41.720 --> 1:06:44.260\n to what the AI could never go past,\n\n1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:46.960\n assuming that encryption, right?\n\n1:06:46.960 --> 1:06:49.000\n That encryption continues to work, right?\n\n1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:53.060\n And assuming that if it's not that AI's specialization\n\n1:06:53.060 --> 1:06:55.920\n to break encryption, that it wouldn't be able to do that,\n\n1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:56.760\n right?\n\n1:06:56.760 --> 1:06:59.200\n So if you have an AI that controls\n\n1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:01.480\n something very important, whatever it is,\n\n1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:03.560\n shipping or something in defense\n\n1:07:03.560 --> 1:07:07.400\n or something in the financial system, whatever it is,\n\n1:07:07.400 --> 1:07:09.060\n but you're sitting there and you're kind of worried,\n\n1:07:09.060 --> 1:07:11.560\n hey, this thing is unbelievable.\n\n1:07:11.560 --> 1:07:13.080\n It's coming up with things\n\n1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:14.980\n we wouldn't have thought of in a hundred years,\n\n1:07:14.980 --> 1:07:17.040\n but maybe it's a little too unbelievable.\n\n1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.680\n How do you limit it?\n\n1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:22.720\n Well, if you bake in private keys\n\n1:07:22.720 --> 1:07:27.020\n and you bake in these kind of blockchain based limitations,\n\n1:07:27.020 --> 1:07:28.960\n you can create the conditions\n\n1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:31.640\n beyond which an AI could never act.\n\n1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:33.500\n And those could once again be codified\n\n1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:36.680\n in the very specific unambiguous terms\n\n1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:38.040\n in which you described,\n\n1:07:38.040 --> 1:07:41.660\n which once again, in my trust issue focused world,\n\n1:07:41.660 --> 1:07:45.020\n would solve the trust issue for users\n\n1:07:45.020 --> 1:07:47.880\n and make them comfortable with using the AI\n\n1:07:47.880 --> 1:07:50.760\n or ceding control to the AI,\n\n1:07:50.760 --> 1:07:53.840\n which I think in more advanced versions of AI\n\n1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:55.840\n will continue to be a concern, right?\n\n1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:57.100\n This is fascinating.\n\n1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:59.280\n So smart contracts actually provide a mechanism\n\n1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:01.600\n for human supervision of AI systems.\n\n1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:04.560\n With encryption, very encryption heavy.\n\n1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.320\n So it's not about like, is it smarter than us?\n\n1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:09.840\n It's about will the encryption hold up?\n\n1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:10.780\n Yep.\n\n1:08:10.780 --> 1:08:15.040\n So that's based on the assumption that encryption holds up.\n\n1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:16.360\n I think that's a safe assumption.\n\n1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:18.120\n We can get into that whole discussion,\n\n1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:19.960\n but from quantum computing,\n\n1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:22.000\n but cracking encryption is very difficult.\n\n1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.680\n That's a whole nother discussion.\n\n1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.520\n I think we're safe on the safe ground\n\n1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.860\n for quite a long time, assuming encryption holds.\n\n1:08:29.860 --> 1:08:34.860\n I, there's a space that is at the cutting edge\n\n1:08:38.020 --> 1:08:41.400\n of general intelligence research in the AI community,\n\n1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:44.680\n which is the space of program synthesis\n\n1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:47.360\n or AI generating programs.\n\n1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:50.300\n So that's different than what you're referring to\n\n1:08:50.300 --> 1:08:54.800\n is AI being able to generate smart contracts.\n\n1:08:54.800 --> 1:08:59.080\n And that to me is kind of fascinating\n\n1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:03.560\n to think of, especially two AI systems\n\n1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:07.080\n between each other, generating contracts,\n\n1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:10.760\n sort of almost creating a world\n\n1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:15.460\n where most of the contracts are between nonhuman beings.\n\n1:09:15.460 --> 1:09:17.800\n I think an AI system, as I think about it,\n\n1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:19.340\n and once again, this is not my field.\n\n1:09:19.340 --> 1:09:21.320\n This is something I might watch a YouTube video on\n\n1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:25.120\n or just see something interesting about at some point.\n\n1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:28.360\n I think if I were to just reason through it even now,\n\n1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:30.960\n I think the highly deterministic\n\n1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:34.400\n and guaranteed nature of smart contracts\n\n1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:37.920\n would probably be preferable to an AI\n\n1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:41.800\n because I'm guessing an AI would have a lot of problems\n\n1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:43.720\n with dealing with the human element\n\n1:09:43.720 --> 1:09:45.600\n of how contracts work today, right?\n\n1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:48.560\n So an AI, for example, couldn't pick up the phone\n\n1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:53.360\n and call Dave at a bank to do a derivative\n\n1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:55.800\n and kind of discuss with Dave and have a call with him\n\n1:09:55.800 --> 1:09:58.840\n and kind of have a conversation and get him comfortable\n\n1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:00.320\n and tell him it's gonna be fine\n\n1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.600\n and kind of smooth out all the weird social cues\n\n1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.180\n that have to do with making certain derivatives.\n\n1:10:06.180 --> 1:10:09.920\n I'm assuming that that's a pretty complicated\n\n1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:13.180\n neural map AI kind of problem.\n\n1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:17.240\n Yeah, so if I think about it,\n\n1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:21.120\n the deterministic guaranteed nature of smart contracts\n\n1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:25.120\n probably would, and if, assuming they're accessible to AIs,\n\n1:10:25.120 --> 1:10:28.540\n could actually, interestingly enough, be the format\n\n1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:32.340\n that they prefer to codify their relationship\n\n1:10:32.340 --> 1:10:37.340\n with non AI systems and very possibly other AI systems,\n\n1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.760\n right, because it is very,\n\n1:10:41.760 --> 1:10:44.060\n I mean, it's pretty guaranteed, right?\n\n1:10:44.060 --> 1:10:46.040\n All the other types of contracts\n\n1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:50.440\n that an AI could go out there and seek to do\n\n1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:55.440\n would require some language processing around the law.\n\n1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:59.520\n And I think, I don't know if this is a term,\n\n1:10:59.520 --> 1:11:01.640\n but probably not a smart AI or a good AI\n\n1:11:01.640 --> 1:11:04.640\n or whatever the term is for a high quality AI,\n\n1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.060\n would probably realize some of the limitations\n\n1:11:08.060 --> 1:11:09.220\n and the risks.\n\n1:11:09.220 --> 1:11:12.000\n Yeah, yeah, AI definitely dislikes ambiguity\n\n1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.560\n and would prefer the determinism,\n\n1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:17.520\n the deterministic nature of smart contracts.\n\n1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.680\n I do wonder about this particular problem\n\n1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:23.500\n and maybe you could speak to it of how smart contracts\n\n1:11:23.500 --> 1:11:27.960\n can take over certain industries in a sense\n\n1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:31.380\n or how certain industries can convert their sets\n\n1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:34.160\n of agreements into smart contracts,\n\n1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:36.360\n which is, you mentioned sort of talking to Dave\n\n1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:41.040\n from the bank, many of our laws, many of our agreements\n\n1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:46.040\n are currently through natural language, through words.\n\n1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:50.320\n And so there is a process of mapping that has to occur\n\n1:11:50.320 --> 1:11:53.800\n in order to convert the legal agreements,\n\n1:11:53.800 --> 1:11:58.280\n legal contracts of today to smart contracts\n\n1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:01.040\n that by the way, AI may be able to help with.\n\n1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:06.040\n But by way of question, how do you think we convert\n\n1:12:06.100 --> 1:12:09.680\n the legal contracts on which many industries\n\n1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:13.520\n currently function today or not even legal contracts,\n\n1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:15.960\n but ambiguous kind of agreements,\n\n1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:19.440\n maybe they're loose sometimes into more formal\n\n1:12:19.440 --> 1:12:22.840\n deterministic agreements that are represented\n\n1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:23.900\n by smart contracts?\n\n1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:29.380\n So I think there's two, maybe two sides to this.\n\n1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:32.940\n I think the first one is actually not a huge problem\n\n1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:35.280\n where you have things like the is the master agreement\n\n1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:37.580\n for derivatives or you have these agreements\n\n1:12:37.580 --> 1:12:41.080\n that basically already reference a system somewhere,\n\n1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:43.220\n like for example, many legal agreements\n\n1:12:43.220 --> 1:12:45.020\n already accept eSignature.\n\n1:12:45.020 --> 1:12:46.520\n And so they're saying, hey, I'm gonna use\n\n1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.320\n this computing system over here around signatures\n\n1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:51.300\n and I'm gonna consider, and there's laws around that\n\n1:12:51.300 --> 1:12:53.640\n and there's clauses that say eSignature is good enough\n\n1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:55.080\n for this agreement.\n\n1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:57.220\n I actually don't think this is a big problem\n\n1:12:57.220 --> 1:12:59.740\n for the vast majority of legal agreements\n\n1:12:59.740 --> 1:13:02.000\n that use systems already.\n\n1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:05.440\n So what you'll do is you'll swap out one repository\n\n1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:09.120\n or one set of system of contract settlement.\n\n1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:11.480\n And you'll just say, hey, this blockchain system over here\n\n1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:13.520\n is my new system of contract settlement.\n\n1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:16.800\n Whatever it says is the state of the agreement\n\n1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:19.520\n instead of the centralized system over there.\n\n1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.260\n And so there's actually a huge amount of agreements\n\n1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:24.840\n that are already able to do that\n\n1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:26.680\n and I think we'll do that.\n\n1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:28.840\n I think there's another side to your question,\n\n1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:33.840\n which is the amount of agreements that are very ambiguous\n\n1:13:33.840 --> 1:13:36.120\n that can be turned into smart contracts.\n\n1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:39.280\n And I think the limitation there is twofold.\n\n1:13:39.280 --> 1:13:41.740\n First of all, like you said earlier,\n\n1:13:41.740 --> 1:13:44.120\n the highly reliable smart contract\n\n1:13:44.120 --> 1:13:46.560\n and the lack of opaqueness and the clarity\n\n1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.560\n of smart contracts is very high and very powerful\n\n1:13:52.120 --> 1:13:54.800\n and very clear and it's, in my opinion,\n\n1:13:54.800 --> 1:13:58.360\n gonna be much, much easier to take a smart contract\n\n1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.680\n and turn it into a set of natural language explanations\n\n1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:05.600\n and just say, hey, this is what this does, right?\n\n1:14:05.600 --> 1:14:08.280\n So I think that many contracts are,\n\n1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:11.000\n and even now in decentralized finance and DeFi\n\n1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:12.000\n and in decentralized insurance,\n\n1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.820\n they're basically being rebuilt in this format\n\n1:14:14.820 --> 1:14:18.200\n and that rebuilding will make them clearer, like you said,\n\n1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:20.240\n and then restating those in natural language\n\n1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:21.680\n and explaining to people, well, you know,\n\n1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:24.340\n whether it is this, I think it'll actually be a lot simpler\n\n1:14:24.340 --> 1:14:26.040\n to explain to people what the contract is about.\n\n1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:27.160\n It's fascinating.\n\n1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:29.180\n Mapping smart contracts into natural language,\n\n1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:30.240\n I didn't even think about that.\n\n1:14:30.240 --> 1:14:33.400\n So that's, you're saying that's doable\n\n1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:35.960\n and natural and easy to do.\n\n1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:37.680\n Because there's so much clear, right?\n\n1:14:37.680 --> 1:14:40.040\n There's that forced clarity that you talked about.\n\n1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:42.840\n I think the second aspect of this problem\n\n1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:47.680\n is the nuance around what contracts can be made unambiguous\n\n1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:49.280\n and I think that comes down to,\n\n1:14:49.280 --> 1:14:51.960\n often comes down to proving what happened,\n\n1:14:51.960 --> 1:14:53.240\n which is where Oracle networks\n\n1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:56.100\n and decentralized Oracle networks and Chainlink would come in\n\n1:14:56.100 --> 1:14:58.740\n and our experience there is quite extensive\n\n1:14:58.740 --> 1:15:00.720\n over the many years that we've worked on many different\n\n1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:02.320\n contract types.\n\n1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:05.560\n I think what it fundamentally comes down to\n\n1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:07.640\n is whether there is data.\n\n1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:11.520\n So we're not gonna be able to make a hybrid smart contract\n\n1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:13.240\n about whether somebody painted your house\n\n1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:15.040\n the right color blue.\n\n1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:16.360\n We're just not gonna be doing that\n\n1:15:16.360 --> 1:15:18.480\n because there's no data feed that tells us\n\n1:15:18.480 --> 1:15:19.760\n that your house was painted blue\n\n1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:22.200\n or that it was the right color of blue.\n\n1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.160\n You know, unless somebody sets up a drone\n\n1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:28.220\n with a color analysis tool and they generate that data.\n\n1:15:28.220 --> 1:15:29.960\n Which by the way, it could be possible, right?\n\n1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:32.240\n They could, there could be, if there's enough demand\n\n1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:33.800\n then the service would be created\n\n1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.500\n that has drones flying around\n\n1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:38.040\n that's telling you about the colors of, you know,\n\n1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:38.920\n all this kind of stuff.\n\n1:15:38.920 --> 1:15:41.560\n So if there's actual demand that that would be created\n\n1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:44.660\n and because there'll be value to connect that data feed\n\n1:15:44.660 --> 1:15:46.360\n to the smart contracts and so on.\n\n1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:48.640\n I think you have it unbelievably right\n\n1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:51.060\n because there are already insurance companies\n\n1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:54.400\n that use drones to monitor construction sites from overhead\n\n1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:57.120\n and see how many people are wearing hard hats.\n\n1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:59.120\n And if the percentage of people wearing hard hats\n\n1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.180\n isn't sufficiently high, then, you know,\n\n1:16:01.180 --> 1:16:02.720\n the policy is voided.\n\n1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:05.240\n And so in that case, there is a data source\n\n1:16:05.240 --> 1:16:06.680\n and that data source can be put\n\n1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:08.360\n into a hybrid smart contract.\n\n1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:11.040\n So the limitation of hybrid smart contracts is,\n\n1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:13.820\n is there a data source or a set of data sources\n\n1:16:13.820 --> 1:16:15.640\n to create definitive truth,\n\n1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:18.960\n to settle the contract and eliminate ambiguity.\n\n1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:22.520\n And then as you said, I think as people realize\n\n1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.800\n that smart contracts are a format\n\n1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:27.240\n in which they can form agreement about things\n\n1:16:27.240 --> 1:16:29.320\n like that insurance product around, you know,\n\n1:16:29.320 --> 1:16:31.200\n how many people are wearing hard hats.\n\n1:16:31.200 --> 1:16:33.760\n If I'm the construction site owner, well, you know,\n\n1:16:33.760 --> 1:16:35.640\n I would really like a guarantee\n\n1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:38.880\n that your insurance policy is gonna pay me out\n\n1:16:38.880 --> 1:16:40.780\n if everyone is wearing hard hats.\n\n1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:44.560\n And in that case, there is demand for the data\n\n1:16:44.560 --> 1:16:46.520\n and people will generate the data.\n\n1:16:46.520 --> 1:16:48.480\n And I actually think the insurance industry\n\n1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:50.080\n is interestingly a precursor of this\n\n1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:51.640\n because they're so data driven.\n\n1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:56.040\n You already see insurance companies paying IoT companies\n\n1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:59.080\n to put data into their customer's infrastructure\n\n1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:01.320\n at the cost of the insurance company\n\n1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:03.840\n to generate the data that the insurance company uses\n\n1:17:03.840 --> 1:17:05.780\n to make a policy for the customer.\n\n1:17:05.780 --> 1:17:08.240\n So you basically already have people\n\n1:17:08.240 --> 1:17:12.200\n who really want to price data into their agreements\n\n1:17:12.200 --> 1:17:15.200\n when they're of sufficiently high value paying\n\n1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:18.820\n for their own customers to get data sensors\n\n1:17:18.820 --> 1:17:20.600\n into their infrastructure.\n\n1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.400\n And I think as smart contracts become more\n\n1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:26.800\n of a requested format or data driven contracts\n\n1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:28.240\n become more of a format,\n\n1:17:28.240 --> 1:17:31.160\n there will be a growing demand\n\n1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:33.680\n about proving what happened through data.\n\n1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:36.820\n So it'll be motivating totally new data feeds being created.\n\n1:17:36.820 --> 1:17:40.240\n By the way, the insurance industry broadly,\n\n1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.800\n the revolutions there, it would be huge.\n\n1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:44.720\n I've worked quite a bit with autonomous vehicles,\n\n1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.700\n semi autonomous and just vehicles in general.\n\n1:17:47.700 --> 1:17:49.680\n The insurance industry there, by the way,\n\n1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:51.520\n makes a huge amount of money,\n\n1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:54.460\n but is using very crappy data feeds,\n\n1:17:56.160 --> 1:18:00.160\n revolutionizing how like not by crappy,\n\n1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:01.520\n I mean very crude.\n\n1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:06.300\n Like literally the insurance is based on things like age,\n\n1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:09.080\n gender, like basic demographic information\n\n1:18:09.080 --> 1:18:13.320\n as opposed to really high resolution information\n\n1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:15.280\n about you as an individual,\n\n1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:18.160\n which you may or may not want to provide.\n\n1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.320\n So you can choose from an individual perspective\n\n1:18:20.320 --> 1:18:21.400\n to provide a data feed.\n\n1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:26.400\n And there like the power of insurance\n\n1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:33.480\n to enable the individual,\n\n1:18:33.480 --> 1:18:36.720\n to empower the individual could be huge\n\n1:18:36.720 --> 1:18:40.460\n because ultimately smart contracts motivate the use of data,\n\n1:18:40.460 --> 1:18:42.160\n the creation of new data feeds,\n\n1:18:42.160 --> 1:18:47.160\n but leveraging the whatever service it provides in truth,\n\n1:18:48.760 --> 1:18:52.680\n as opposed to some kind of very loose notion of who you are.\n\n1:18:52.680 --> 1:18:55.240\n So that I'm not, again,\n\n1:18:55.240 --> 1:18:57.200\n not sure how that would change things,\n\n1:18:57.200 --> 1:19:02.200\n but in terms of the fundamental experience of life,\n\n1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:04.040\n because I think we all rely on insurance,\n\n1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:06.160\n not just in business, but in life\n\n1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:09.300\n and grounding that insurance\n\n1:19:09.300 --> 1:19:13.320\n in more and more accurate representation of reality\n\n1:19:13.320 --> 1:19:15.940\n might just have transformative effects on society.\n\n1:19:15.940 --> 1:19:18.840\n Well, just to mention one quick thing that you said,\n\n1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:20.560\n where I noticed another trust issue,\n\n1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:23.720\n you said the user might not want to share their data.\n\n1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.140\n So what you could actually do,\n\n1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:26.980\n and what we've already worked on is,\n\n1:19:26.980 --> 1:19:30.240\n you can have a smart contract that holds the data\n\n1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:32.900\n and evaluates the data of the user\n\n1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:35.480\n without sharing it with the insurance companies.\n\n1:19:35.480 --> 1:19:38.080\n And the insurance company knows that the smart contract\n\n1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:40.520\n will evaluate it according to the policy.\n\n1:19:40.520 --> 1:19:41.880\n They don't need the data.\n\n1:19:41.880 --> 1:19:45.280\n And the user can provide the data\n\n1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.200\n knowing it'll never touch the insurance company\n\n1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:49.860\n because it's only provided to the smart contract.\n\n1:19:49.860 --> 1:19:52.480\n And suddenly you've solved another trust issue\n\n1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:54.520\n because the autonomous piece of code\n\n1:19:54.520 --> 1:19:58.280\n can evaluate information separately from the interests\n\n1:19:58.280 --> 1:20:00.320\n of both of the counterparties.\n\n1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:02.040\n And so this is the recurring theme.\n\n1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:03.580\n I think you're seeing this recurring theme\n\n1:20:03.580 --> 1:20:05.280\n where there's a trust issue,\n\n1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:07.840\n people can't use the system, they can't collaborate,\n\n1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:09.280\n they can't share information\n\n1:20:09.280 --> 1:20:11.240\n that would make a better agreement for both of them,\n\n1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:14.640\n they can't solve a risk in their daily life,\n\n1:20:14.640 --> 1:20:16.260\n they can't participate in a market,\n\n1:20:16.260 --> 1:20:17.560\n they can't have a bank account\n\n1:20:17.560 --> 1:20:18.600\n because nobody will give it to them\n\n1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:22.000\n because they can't give it to them in that legal system.\n\n1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.360\n And once you have an autonomous piece of code\n\n1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:27.920\n that can also know what's going on,\n\n1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:30.580\n thanks to Oracle networks and that combination of the code\n\n1:20:30.580 --> 1:20:33.280\n and the Oracle network for the hybrid smart contract,\n\n1:20:34.240 --> 1:20:36.720\n the same pattern just recurs.\n\n1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:38.160\n It's really the same pattern.\n\n1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:40.720\n And this is why I keep saying trust issues.\n\n1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:43.080\n It's because I basically,\n\n1:20:43.080 --> 1:20:45.780\n almost every contractual trust issue that I see\n\n1:20:45.780 --> 1:20:47.620\n where there is a piece of data to prove\n\n1:20:47.620 --> 1:20:49.740\n and settle the trust issue\n\n1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:51.640\n in a way that works for both parties,\n\n1:20:53.320 --> 1:20:55.840\n there is no reason not to use an autonomous,\n\n1:20:55.840 --> 1:20:59.600\n highly reliable contract and piece of code.\n\n1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:01.240\n And I have to tell you,\n\n1:21:01.240 --> 1:21:04.080\n I've seen this in a lot of different industries.\n\n1:21:04.080 --> 1:21:07.120\n I've seen it insurance, ad networks,\n\n1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:09.200\n global finance, global trade,\n\n1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:11.760\n those are all multi trillion dollar industries.\n\n1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:14.040\n And then there are other smaller industries.\n\n1:21:14.040 --> 1:21:16.240\n Like even one of the first smart contracts\n\n1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:17.760\n we worked on many years ago\n\n1:21:17.760 --> 1:21:20.640\n was for search engine optimization firms\n\n1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:21.640\n where they would tell you,\n\n1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:24.160\n hey, I'm gonna raise your search engine ranking,\n\n1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:25.520\n give me the money.\n\n1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:26.920\n And people wouldn't wanna give them the money\n\n1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:29.760\n because they never knew if they were gonna do it.\n\n1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:30.840\n And then the search engine firm\n\n1:21:30.840 --> 1:21:31.740\n doesn't wanna do any work\n\n1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:33.600\n thinking they'll never get any money.\n\n1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.200\n So we just initially even came up with a system\n\n1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:38.960\n where you could put Bitcoin into a smart contract\n\n1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:42.480\n and it would be released based on whether the search rank\n\n1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:45.000\n of a website got to a certain level on Google\n\n1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.080\n for a certain keyword, right?\n\n1:21:47.080 --> 1:21:49.140\n And so the trust problem was solved.\n\n1:21:49.140 --> 1:21:50.740\n But it's just the same story, right?\n\n1:21:50.740 --> 1:21:52.560\n It's kind of like trust issues around AI,\n\n1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:54.200\n trust issues around financial products,\n\n1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.480\n trust issues around insurance,\n\n1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:58.960\n trust issues around social media, whatever it is.\n\n1:21:58.960 --> 1:22:03.960\n I think that's what people looking at this industry\n\n1:22:04.500 --> 1:22:06.140\n really need to understand.\n\n1:22:06.140 --> 1:22:07.200\n And once they do understand,\n\n1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:09.440\n they realize what this is all about.\n\n1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:14.240\n This is about redefining how everyone collaborates\n\n1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:17.360\n with everyone about everything\n\n1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:20.000\n where we can prove something through data.\n\n1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.520\n You've mentioned confidentiality and privacy\n\n1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:27.520\n that the parties don't need to necessarily know private data\n\n1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:28.360\n in this interaction.\n\n1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:32.360\n You talk about confidentiality in the white paper\n\n1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:33.940\n for Chainlink 2.0.\n\n1:22:33.940 --> 1:22:38.080\n Can you talk more about how to achieve confidentiality\n\n1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:39.000\n in this process?\n\n1:22:39.860 --> 1:22:41.740\n Sure, sure, absolutely.\n\n1:22:43.220 --> 1:22:45.560\n So I think you once again need to think of the contract\n\n1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:47.020\n as existing in two parts, right?\n\n1:22:47.020 --> 1:22:48.340\n You have the on chain code\n\n1:22:48.340 --> 1:22:49.880\n and then you have this off chain system\n\n1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:51.840\n called the centralized Oracle network.\n\n1:22:52.740 --> 1:22:56.720\n So the question is really what portion of the contract\n\n1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:00.680\n should live in what part of these two systems, right?\n\n1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:03.720\n So if you wanna create transparency,\n\n1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:06.960\n you should put more information on chain\n\n1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:09.240\n because that's what blockchains are very good at.\n\n1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:12.240\n They're public, transparent,\n\n1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:15.000\n but they don't necessarily have privacy.\n\n1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.700\n Well, you can see how those two things\n\n1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:21.440\n are a little bit kind of completely diametrically opposed.\n\n1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:25.360\n So I do think and I do see blockchains working\n\n1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:28.800\n on on chain encrypted smart contracts.\n\n1:23:28.800 --> 1:23:29.980\n That's very inefficient.\n\n1:23:29.980 --> 1:23:32.640\n It has a lot of nuances around it.\n\n1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:35.060\n That I think will appear at some point.\n\n1:23:35.060 --> 1:23:37.320\n I think until it appears,\n\n1:23:37.320 --> 1:23:41.580\n you have an option of taking a part of the computation\n\n1:23:41.580 --> 1:23:44.800\n and putting it into the centralized Oracle network.\n\n1:23:44.800 --> 1:23:47.160\n We actually did an entire paper about this\n\n1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:51.200\n that we presented at Stanford in February of last year,\n\n1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:53.420\n something called Mixicles,\n\n1:23:53.420 --> 1:23:55.640\n which basically talks about how you can take\n\n1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:58.380\n an Oracle network and you can put a portion\n\n1:23:58.380 --> 1:24:01.080\n of the computation into the Oracle network,\n\n1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:04.160\n assuming that you're comfortable with that limited set\n\n1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:07.060\n of nodes knowing what the computation is.\n\n1:24:07.060 --> 1:24:09.760\n And you could actually provide additional confidentiality\n\n1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:11.060\n through special hardware\n\n1:24:11.060 --> 1:24:12.920\n called trusted execution environments\n\n1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:15.320\n that all those nodes are forced to run.\n\n1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:17.900\n So they won't even know what they're operating.\n\n1:24:17.900 --> 1:24:19.600\n And so at the end of the day,\n\n1:24:19.600 --> 1:24:22.160\n if you look at a hybrid smart contract\n\n1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:24.680\n as gaining functionality from its on chain code\n\n1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:26.160\n and gaining other functionality\n\n1:24:26.160 --> 1:24:30.520\n from its off chain decentralized Oracle network component,\n\n1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:32.840\n you can place the part of the computation\n\n1:24:32.840 --> 1:24:34.600\n that you would like to be private\n\n1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:37.280\n in the decentralized Oracle network,\n\n1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:40.800\n because you can control the set of nodes.\n\n1:24:40.800 --> 1:24:42.820\n You can control the committee of nodes\n\n1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:46.120\n and you can require that they run certain hardware\n\n1:24:46.120 --> 1:24:48.000\n to keep the information private, right?\n\n1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.760\n So you could basically make a derivative that,\n\n1:24:50.760 --> 1:24:52.560\n or a binary option is the example used\n\n1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.200\n in the Mixicles paper where the payout happened on chain,\n\n1:24:57.200 --> 1:24:59.680\n but it was actually impossible to tell\n\n1:24:59.680 --> 1:25:02.400\n what the outcome of the contract was.\n\n1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:04.820\n So the outcome of the contract was computed\n\n1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:06.560\n in the centralized Oracle network.\n\n1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:08.680\n And then there was a switch that triggered\n\n1:25:08.680 --> 1:25:10.440\n who received the payment,\n\n1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:13.760\n but from the point of view of analyzing\n\n1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:18.760\n the on chain transactions and seeing who received\n\n1:25:18.760 --> 1:25:21.480\n the payment or what the outcome of the contract was,\n\n1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.000\n you couldn't derive that,\n\n1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.400\n you couldn't backward engineer what that was,\n\n1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:30.160\n but the users of that hybrid smart contract\n\n1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:33.560\n still had on chain code that guaranteed them\n\n1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:36.080\n that as long as the decentralized Oracle network\n\n1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:37.920\n found a certain outcome, right?\n\n1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:39.540\n Determined a certain outcome\n\n1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:42.080\n that the relevant user would get paid\n\n1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:45.680\n and there was still a place to put value, right?\n\n1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:49.360\n So there is this kind of fundamental tension\n\n1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:52.400\n between confidentiality, privacy,\n\n1:25:52.400 --> 1:25:54.240\n which is very important for many contracts,\n\n1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:56.160\n which is critical to many contracts\n\n1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:59.560\n and the public and transparent nature of blockchains,\n\n1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.920\n which I think eventually will be solved\n\n1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:04.720\n through encrypted on chain smart contracts.\n\n1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:05.920\n That'll take some time,\n\n1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.240\n I think that'll take years in my opinion.\n\n1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:11.000\n And before we arrive there,\n\n1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.120\n I think people will put the private portion\n\n1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:15.080\n into the centralized Oracle network.\n\n1:26:15.080 --> 1:26:16.760\n Once again, going back to what\n\n1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:19.080\n the decentralized Oracle networks do,\n\n1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:21.660\n they seek to provide these services, right?\n\n1:26:21.660 --> 1:26:25.360\n So the ability to do a privacy preserving computation\n\n1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:28.160\n is perhaps a service without which\n\n1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:31.480\n a certain type of contract might never come into existence\n\n1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:34.560\n in the form of an on chain hybrid smart contract.\n\n1:26:34.560 --> 1:26:35.920\n And so this is once again,\n\n1:26:35.920 --> 1:26:38.240\n what we see the centralized Oracle networks\n\n1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:40.040\n and decentralized services doing\n\n1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:43.060\n is providing people these tools and building blocks\n\n1:26:43.060 --> 1:26:46.760\n to compose, like I'm great at making\n\n1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:48.000\n these derivatives contracts,\n\n1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.360\n but I can't make them unless I can retain\n\n1:26:50.360 --> 1:26:52.200\n the privacy of them.\n\n1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:56.120\n And our goal is to provide the infrastructure\n\n1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.680\n that gives you as a developer\n\n1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:00.940\n and as a creator of smart contracts, that capability.\n\n1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:03.680\n And what we've seen is that as we provide that capability,\n\n1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:04.920\n people create more,\n\n1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.240\n which is also really the story of the internet, right?\n\n1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.520\n The story of the internet is it was really tough\n\n1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:13.200\n to do eCommerce while everything was an HTTP\n\n1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:15.760\n and credit cards were transmitted publicly.\n\n1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:17.240\n And so eCommerce was kind of tough\n\n1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:18.880\n because how am I gonna send my credit card\n\n1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:21.400\n over public on encrypted channels, right?\n\n1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:23.280\n But the second HTTPS appears,\n\n1:27:23.280 --> 1:27:24.920\n eCommerce becomes a lot easier\n\n1:27:24.920 --> 1:27:26.920\n because I can put in my credit card number\n\n1:27:26.920 --> 1:27:29.120\n and it can be sent over an encrypted channel\n\n1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:30.500\n and it's not at risk.\n\n1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:32.000\n And so I can participate in eCommerce\n\n1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.680\n as long as I have a credit card.\n\n1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:36.880\n I think those types, and I'm sure that was unexpected,\n\n1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.120\n right, I'm sure at the time that was an unexpected outcome\n\n1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.000\n from that technology.\n\n1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:45.440\n And so I think this is why we sometimes have this focus\n\n1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:48.560\n on privacy because in our work with contracts\n\n1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:51.760\n and their transition into this hybrid smart contract form,\n\n1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:55.780\n we see a substantial amount of need for privacy\n\n1:27:55.780 --> 1:27:59.860\n as an inherent property of these contracts.\n\n1:27:59.860 --> 1:28:01.880\n And it'll take a while before that's possible\n\n1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:04.480\n to create the kind of technology innovation required\n\n1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:05.600\n to do that on chain.\n\n1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:07.880\n I know there's a few ideas that are being floating about,\n\n1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:10.820\n but so the currently distributed Oracle networks\n\n1:28:10.820 --> 1:28:14.280\n provide that feature, which is essential to many contracts.\n\n1:28:14.280 --> 1:28:16.880\n What brings to mind in this whole space,\n\n1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:20.240\n again, it might be outside of your expertise,\n\n1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:23.520\n but within the world which I'm passionate about,\n\n1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:25.120\n which is machine learning,\n\n1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.860\n and it seems like very naturally\n\n1:28:27.860 --> 1:28:31.280\n because current machine learning systems\n\n1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:33.320\n are very data hungry\n\n1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:37.900\n and much of the value mined by companies\n\n1:28:37.900 --> 1:28:40.400\n in the digital space are from data.\n\n1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.880\n They often want their data to maintain privacy.\n\n1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:47.500\n So you think about an autonomous vehicle space,\n\n1:28:47.500 --> 1:28:49.520\n Tesla is collecting a huge amount of data,\n\n1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:53.160\n Waymo is collecting a huge amount of data.\n\n1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:54.760\n It seems like it would be very beneficial\n\n1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:57.200\n to form contracts where one could use the data\n\n1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.720\n from the other in some kind of privacy preserving way,\n\n1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:05.720\n but also where all the uses of data are codified\n\n1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:08.560\n and you can exchange value cleanly,\n\n1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:10.720\n basically contracts over data,\n\n1:29:10.720 --> 1:29:15.720\n over machine learning systems use of different data.\n\n1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:19.200\n I don't know, do you talk to machine learning folks\n\n1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:21.480\n that use ideas of smart contracts\n\n1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:23.320\n or is that for outside of your interest?\n\n1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:27.460\n Because it seems like exceptionally applicable set of,\n\n1:29:27.460 --> 1:29:29.120\n when we talk about different services\n\n1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:33.360\n that might be created and revolutionized by smart,\n\n1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:36.200\n especially hybrid smart contracts,\n\n1:29:36.200 --> 1:29:40.120\n I think machine learning systems comes to mind to me\n\n1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:42.200\n in all industries.\n\n1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:43.520\n I don't know if you've gotten a chance\n\n1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:46.680\n to interact with those folks, with those services.\n\n1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:49.160\n I think what you're talking about is more data marketplaces\n\n1:29:49.160 --> 1:29:51.740\n in the data marketplace side of things.\n\n1:29:52.860 --> 1:29:55.360\n Well, this is actually once again, very applicable\n\n1:29:55.360 --> 1:29:56.760\n because there's a trust issue.\n\n1:29:56.760 --> 1:29:58.400\n At the end of the day,\n\n1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:00.560\n let's say I'm trying to sell you some data.\n\n1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:03.000\n You don't know the quality of the data.\n\n1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.720\n So you don't know what you wanna pay for it.\n\n1:30:04.720 --> 1:30:06.540\n And I can't give you the data for you\n\n1:30:06.540 --> 1:30:07.520\n to determine the quality\n\n1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:09.880\n because I've given you the data, right?\n\n1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:10.720\n Guess what?\n\n1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:13.680\n We need an autonomous impartial agent.\n\n1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:17.160\n We need an impartial computational kind of agent\n\n1:30:17.160 --> 1:30:20.920\n and on chain smart contract with an Oracle network\n\n1:30:20.920 --> 1:30:23.320\n to assess my data to write,\n\n1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:28.320\n to basically take random cross section samples of the data,\n\n1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:31.920\n assess it for quality, assess it for signal\n\n1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:33.560\n from the algorithm you have,\n\n1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.200\n which you don't wanna share with me\n\n1:30:35.200 --> 1:30:36.400\n because you don't wanna know the algorithm\n\n1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:37.760\n you're working on, right?\n\n1:30:37.760 --> 1:30:40.880\n You don't want me to know what you want the data for.\n\n1:30:40.880 --> 1:30:44.120\n So now the autonomous agent takes your algorithm,\n\n1:30:44.120 --> 1:30:46.020\n keeping it private from me and takes my data,\n\n1:30:46.020 --> 1:30:47.720\n keeping it private from you,\n\n1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:50.680\n assesses it on a random cross section sampling\n\n1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:54.700\n for quality of data, returns the scoring back to you,\n\n1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.480\n allows you to determine a price.\n\n1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:00.400\n And now both you and me know that we've arrived\n\n1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:03.680\n at a fair price for the quality of my data\n\n1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:05.620\n for what you wanna do with it.\n\n1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:09.400\n And that's once again,\n\n1:31:09.400 --> 1:31:12.180\n from what I've seen in the data marketplaces,\n\n1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:14.680\n which are full of people who want that data\n\n1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:17.400\n for these learning models, often for financial markets,\n\n1:31:17.400 --> 1:31:20.240\n often for other reasons,\n\n1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:22.240\n this is their fundamental problem,\n\n1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:24.440\n which amazingly enough,\n\n1:31:24.440 --> 1:31:28.080\n there's a trust issue that is getting solved.\n\n1:31:28.080 --> 1:31:31.160\n And I think you can see even on the face of it,\n\n1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:33.640\n once that trust issue is solved,\n\n1:31:33.640 --> 1:31:36.680\n those markets can work a lot better, right?\n\n1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:38.000\n I don't need to know your algorithm.\n\n1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:39.560\n You don't need to know my data.\n\n1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:41.920\n We both know that the autonomous agent\n\n1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:43.680\n is not under either of our control\n\n1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:46.360\n and gave us a fair assessment and a fair price.\n\n1:31:46.360 --> 1:31:47.960\n And that's it.\n\n1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:50.960\n And we're all very comfortable with that.\n\n1:31:50.960 --> 1:31:52.560\n I could even make conditions\n\n1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:55.360\n that your algorithm isn't analyzing the data\n\n1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:57.160\n for something I don't want you to analyze it for,\n\n1:31:57.160 --> 1:31:59.000\n or you could make conditions\n\n1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:02.440\n that the data has to have any number of properties.\n\n1:32:02.440 --> 1:32:05.160\n And once again, you haven't leaked any signal to me\n\n1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.480\n and I haven't leaked any data to you,\n\n1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:09.120\n which is once again,\n\n1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:12.280\n just another type of trust issue that all of this solve.\n\n1:32:12.280 --> 1:32:14.200\n So it's the same pattern.\n\n1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:15.840\n If you work in this industry long enough,\n\n1:32:15.840 --> 1:32:18.440\n or if you really look at these use cases long enough,\n\n1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:20.080\n you'll simply come to the question,\n\n1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:22.280\n and this is the useful question,\n\n1:32:22.280 --> 1:32:24.800\n what is the trust issue this is solving?\n\n1:32:24.800 --> 1:32:27.160\n And then if you can get an answer to that question\n\n1:32:27.160 --> 1:32:28.960\n on a case by case basis,\n\n1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:32.640\n that's when you'll understand why blockchains are relevant.\n\n1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:35.240\n And then once you do that with enough use cases,\n\n1:32:35.240 --> 1:32:38.640\n it becomes a little bit mind blank.\n\n1:32:38.640 --> 1:32:40.600\n You've mentioned trust quite a bit.\n\n1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:45.600\n You also mentioned trust minimization\n\n1:32:45.880 --> 1:32:47.600\n in the Chainlink White Paper.\n\n1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:51.600\n Can we dig into trust a little bit more?\n\n1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:53.800\n What is the nature of trust\n\n1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:56.120\n that you think about in these smart contracts?\n\n1:32:56.120 --> 1:32:58.160\n What is trust minimization?\n\n1:32:58.160 --> 1:33:01.140\n How do we accomplish, achieve trust minimization?\n\n1:33:02.160 --> 1:33:03.000\n Sure, sure.\n\n1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.640\n I think it's important maybe to have a conception\n\n1:33:05.640 --> 1:33:07.440\n of what the alternative is, right?\n\n1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:11.640\n What is highly reliable trust minimized off chain\n\n1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:14.080\n and on chain computation and alternative to?\n\n1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:17.000\n So this is just kind of how I see the world\n\n1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:18.960\n in these two camps.\n\n1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.760\n One camp is the traditional,\n\n1:33:20.760 --> 1:33:25.240\n what I call brand based or paper guarantee camp.\n\n1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:27.520\n And this is the world as pretty much most\n\n1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:29.120\n or all people know today.\n\n1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:31.400\n This is the world where there's a bank logo\n\n1:33:31.400 --> 1:33:34.160\n or an insurance company logo, or some kind of logo.\n\n1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:36.460\n There's a very big building with marble arches\n\n1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:39.440\n and columns, it's the biggest building in the town.\n\n1:33:39.440 --> 1:33:40.980\n It's bigger than the church.\n\n1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:42.360\n And everybody feels very good.\n\n1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:43.720\n Everybody's got such a nice logo.\n\n1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:45.240\n It's such a big building.\n\n1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:47.640\n Why don't I give them my money?\n\n1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:49.760\n Why don't I interact with them on the basis\n\n1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:51.820\n of any kind of agreement?\n\n1:33:51.820 --> 1:33:52.900\n And that's good.\n\n1:33:52.900 --> 1:33:56.120\n And that is definitely better than that not being there.\n\n1:33:56.120 --> 1:33:57.980\n And that is definitely a huge improvement\n\n1:33:57.980 --> 1:34:00.280\n for how people conduct commerce.\n\n1:34:00.280 --> 1:34:04.140\n Letters of credit from branded entities\n\n1:34:04.140 --> 1:34:06.760\n are very important for global trade to take place\n\n1:34:06.760 --> 1:34:09.360\n in the early stages of global trade.\n\n1:34:09.360 --> 1:34:13.480\n So that's good, but it is fundamentally\n\n1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:16.800\n just a paper agreement with a legal framework behind it.\n\n1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:20.680\n And if the paper agreement you have would say Robinhood\n\n1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:24.000\n or somebody else suddenly has to change,\n\n1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.520\n well, it changes and you can't really do anything about it.\n\n1:34:26.520 --> 1:34:28.320\n You won't be able to change anything\n\n1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:29.740\n about what happened there.\n\n1:34:29.740 --> 1:34:31.240\n There's some long terms of service.\n\n1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:34.560\n There's some other agreements around all this stuff.\n\n1:34:34.560 --> 1:34:36.560\n At the end of the day,\n\n1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.480\n that's the brand based and paper guarantee world\n\n1:34:40.440 --> 1:34:42.240\n where it's all very vague and opaque\n\n1:34:42.240 --> 1:34:44.080\n and you're kind of hoping for the best\n\n1:34:44.080 --> 1:34:45.680\n because there's a nice logo.\n\n1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:47.240\n It's been around a hundred years.\n\n1:34:47.240 --> 1:34:48.320\n There's a lot of marble.\n\n1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:49.320\n Put a lot of marble.\n\n1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:50.800\n Big building, lots of marbles.\n\n1:34:50.800 --> 1:34:53.760\n This is why banks have such nice buildings, right?\n\n1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:56.040\n It's not because they want to spend money on buildings.\n\n1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:00.000\n It's to create confidence in them as an entity\n\n1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.200\n in order for people to transact through them, right?\n\n1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:06.440\n This is why all these kind of go to cities\n\n1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:08.760\n that had gold rushes, go to cities\n\n1:35:08.760 --> 1:35:12.560\n that needed banking as a service in certain time periods,\n\n1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.040\n they're the most beautiful buildings\n\n1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:15.960\n at least in the United States.\n\n1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:19.040\n So this is the brand based paper guarantee model\n\n1:35:19.040 --> 1:35:20.480\n for which up until now,\n\n1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:22.040\n there has never been an alternative, right?\n\n1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:25.080\n So up until now, if you had a bad experience with a bank\n\n1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:28.360\n or insurance company or some logo somewhere,\n\n1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:30.360\n you would only have one option.\n\n1:35:30.360 --> 1:35:32.360\n Your option would be to go across the road\n\n1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:35.400\n and down the block to another building\n\n1:35:35.400 --> 1:35:37.680\n with another color of marble\n\n1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:39.320\n and another set of agreements\n\n1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:43.120\n that are fundamentally still paper brand agreements, right?\n\n1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:47.560\n Now for the first time, you have mathematical agreements.\n\n1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:52.480\n You have mathematically guaranteed encryption secured,\n\n1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:56.520\n decentralized infrastructure powered agreements, right?\n\n1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.480\n This is really the shift.\n\n1:35:59.480 --> 1:36:03.400\n This is really the comparison and the alternative\n\n1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:05.560\n through which people should view all of this in my opinion,\n\n1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:07.960\n because there's once again, this conception\n\n1:36:07.960 --> 1:36:11.080\n that everything is fine, everything works very well.\n\n1:36:11.080 --> 1:36:13.480\n Well, it does, it works fine and very well\n\n1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:15.120\n as long as nothing goes wrong.\n\n1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:17.520\n And then in the cases when things go wrong,\n\n1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.360\n which they pretty much invariably at some point do,\n\n1:36:20.360 --> 1:36:22.040\n then you find out that, well, you know,\n\n1:36:22.040 --> 1:36:23.840\n turns out they don't have to pay me\n\n1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:25.240\n or turns out I can't trade\n\n1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:27.920\n or turns out the ATMs can be locked up\n\n1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:30.120\n and only give me 66 euros per day,\n\n1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:31.760\n whether I'm a business or an individual,\n\n1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.080\n like what happened in Greece a few years ago, right?\n\n1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:40.080\n And the reality is that once that becomes a strong enough\n\n1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:43.840\n kind of realization for people,\n\n1:36:43.840 --> 1:36:45.280\n I think they will all just migrate\n\n1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:47.480\n to mathematically guaranteed contracts\n\n1:36:47.480 --> 1:36:49.520\n because why wouldn't you?\n\n1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:53.240\n So in the world of mathematically guaranteed contracts,\n\n1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:56.240\n kind of how do we, and cryptographically secured\n\n1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:57.960\n and decentralized infrastructure powered,\n\n1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:00.200\n how do we evolve into that world?\n\n1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:05.080\n Well, at the end of the day, it comes down to consensus,\n\n1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.560\n right, it comes down to a collection of independent nodes,\n\n1:37:09.560 --> 1:37:13.280\n a collection of provably independent computing systems\n\n1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:17.120\n arriving at the same conclusion impartially.\n\n1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:20.440\n That conclusion might be the transaction\n\n1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:25.280\n is valid between address A and address B,\n\n1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:26.720\n address A has one Bitcoin,\n\n1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:27.920\n wants to send it to address B,\n\n1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:29.960\n now address B has one Bitcoin, right?\n\n1:37:29.960 --> 1:37:32.000\n So that's one degree of validation.\n\n1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.880\n It has certain cryptographic primitives\n\n1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:36.240\n that are used, certain levels of cryptography,\n\n1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:37.760\n encryption, and other methods\n\n1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:42.480\n that basically provide clarity and those guarantees.\n\n1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:44.640\n But fundamentally, it's this level of consensus\n\n1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:48.120\n that multiple independent computing systems\n\n1:37:48.120 --> 1:37:51.280\n came to the same conclusion, verified that conclusion\n\n1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:53.480\n and created a sense of finality,\n\n1:37:53.480 --> 1:37:56.920\n created a final state that is globally considered\n\n1:37:56.920 --> 1:37:59.520\n to be the state of a transaction.\n\n1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:03.840\n And that is how it's achieved, right?\n\n1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:06.720\n So it's achieved by users looking\n\n1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:11.320\n at these mathematical contract systems and saying,\n\n1:38:11.320 --> 1:38:13.720\n you know, if I have money in a bank,\n\n1:38:13.720 --> 1:38:16.400\n there's one single person who controls that money,\n\n1:38:16.400 --> 1:38:17.400\n that's the bank,\n\n1:38:17.400 --> 1:38:18.680\n they could choose to give me my money\n\n1:38:18.680 --> 1:38:20.880\n or choose not to give me my money.\n\n1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.040\n And that's great,\n\n1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:24.040\n but maybe there's a percentage of what I own\n\n1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:26.240\n that I wanna put into another system\n\n1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:29.160\n where there's thousands of independent computing systems\n\n1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:31.160\n that are promising me, you know,\n\n1:38:31.160 --> 1:38:33.200\n with the help of cryptographic primitives,\n\n1:38:33.200 --> 1:38:36.600\n that I will be able to always have access to this,\n\n1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:41.080\n whatever this is, whatever this token is,\n\n1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:43.520\n I will at least, or at the very least,\n\n1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:45.920\n I will always have unfettered,\n\n1:38:45.920 --> 1:38:48.240\n complete control and access to it.\n\n1:38:48.240 --> 1:38:50.400\n So, you know, that's one example.\n\n1:38:50.400 --> 1:38:51.440\n Another example is, hey,\n\n1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:52.960\n we have a hybrid smart contract\n\n1:38:52.960 --> 1:38:55.160\n for something like crop insurance.\n\n1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:59.200\n I, as the user, evaluate where this smart contract runs.\n\n1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.520\n Oh, wow, the smart contract runs on Ethereum.\n\n1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:03.560\n Great, thousands of nodes,\n\n1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:06.760\n lots of computational security,\n\n1:39:06.760 --> 1:39:08.560\n hash power, so on and so on.\n\n1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:10.920\n Then I look at, oh, well, what triggers the contract?\n\n1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:12.440\n Oh, there's this Oracle network.\n\n1:39:12.440 --> 1:39:15.520\n Okay, it's composed of 25 nodes or 15 nodes,\n\n1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:18.080\n gets data from five different weather stations.\n\n1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:19.920\n You know, I'm comfortable with that.\n\n1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:21.480\n I have a certain level of comfort\n\n1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:23.200\n with that hybrid smart contract\n\n1:39:23.200 --> 1:39:26.760\n and its ability to provide me consensus\n\n1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:28.360\n about the transaction\n\n1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:30.600\n once the contract knows what's happened,\n\n1:39:30.600 --> 1:39:34.520\n and I'm comfortable with the consensus around the event\n\n1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.240\n that controls the contract, right?\n\n1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:37.560\n Because once again,\n\n1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.880\n that event is what determines\n\n1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:41.480\n what happens with the contract.\n\n1:39:41.480 --> 1:39:43.960\n And if the contract is super well written,\n\n1:39:43.960 --> 1:39:47.080\n it doesn't matter if the event isn't reliable, right?\n\n1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:48.600\n So now I've made this determination.\n\n1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:51.240\n I've gotten all this clear, transparent information\n\n1:39:51.240 --> 1:39:55.640\n about this system that combines the contract code\n\n1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:57.600\n with a decentralized Oracle network.\n\n1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600\n And I've made my decision to participate\n\n1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:02.000\n in this decentralized insurance,\n\n1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.840\n kind of crop insurance policy.\n\n1:40:03.840 --> 1:40:06.560\n I've sent the Bitcoin or the stable coin\n\n1:40:06.560 --> 1:40:09.200\n or whatever I have on my Android phone.\n\n1:40:09.200 --> 1:40:12.400\n And then time goes by and let's say it doesn't rain,\n\n1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:15.520\n lo and behold, the smart contract returns\n\n1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:19.040\n the relevant amount from the policy back to me.\n\n1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:22.160\n I continue my life as a farmer.\n\n1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:25.080\n And by the way, the fact that that happened\n\n1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:28.400\n contributes reputation and contributes proof\n\n1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:30.400\n back to both the contract\n\n1:40:30.400 --> 1:40:32.600\n as something that can prove to other people\n\n1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:35.800\n that it has settled and the Oracle network\n\n1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:36.920\n as something that can prove\n\n1:40:36.920 --> 1:40:39.560\n that it has properly assessed reality\n\n1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:41.760\n or properly triggered a contract.\n\n1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:44.400\n And this is where there's one of many network effects\n\n1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:47.720\n where the more that smart contracts\n\n1:40:47.720 --> 1:40:49.360\n and Oracle networks are used,\n\n1:40:49.360 --> 1:40:53.400\n they themselves generate this immutable on chain data\n\n1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:57.920\n that proves their value and reliability.\n\n1:40:57.920 --> 1:41:00.640\n And improving more and more of that\n\n1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:03.800\n in more and more kind of use cases\n\n1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:06.840\n and more and more variants of the same contract,\n\n1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:09.840\n they arrive at a greater body of proof\n\n1:41:09.840 --> 1:41:12.960\n that they like, I am the decentralized crop,\n\n1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:16.720\n the decentralized insurance contract for crop insurance\n\n1:41:16.720 --> 1:41:19.880\n used by a million users.\n\n1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:24.560\n And my failure rate is non existent or really low.\n\n1:41:24.560 --> 1:41:25.720\n And here's my Oracle network.\n\n1:41:25.720 --> 1:41:28.840\n And by the way, it's also settled a million of these.\n\n1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:31.480\n And so it's not the logo, right?\n\n1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:35.560\n It's not, hey, what a nice logo you have\n\n1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.120\n on top of a building above a train terminal or something.\n\n1:41:40.120 --> 1:41:44.040\n It's much more, hey, there's a million people,\n\n1:41:44.040 --> 1:41:45.480\n there's a million separate contracts\n\n1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:46.680\n that got settled correctly.\n\n1:41:46.680 --> 1:41:50.360\n I have all the proof that I could ever need about that.\n\n1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:53.440\n And it's not something that's very easy to gain, right?\n\n1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:57.080\n Because real value was at stake, real value was moved around.\n\n1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.160\n And so I think once again,\n\n1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:02.560\n the transparency aspect comes in where you're able to prove\n\n1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:07.560\n that the cryptographically enforced contracts are better.\n\n1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.040\n That said, you can still integrate the traditional banks\n\n1:42:12.040 --> 1:42:13.520\n as long as you create a data feed\n\n1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:16.960\n on the amount of marble that's included.\n\n1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:19.280\n So if that's valuable to you in terms of reputation,\n\n1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:22.360\n you could still integrate the marble, the amount of marble\n\n1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:26.000\n that and the size of the logo.\n\n1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.600\n We could still keep the banks around.\n\n1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:29.440\n I think we will.\n\n1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:30.800\n I think what'll happen with the banks\n\n1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:32.480\n and all the insurance companies, by the way,\n\n1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:34.840\n is not that they'll all just die or something.\n\n1:42:34.840 --> 1:42:36.400\n I think it'll be just like the internet.\n\n1:42:36.400 --> 1:42:38.640\n There'll be some of them that adopt this\n\n1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:40.120\n and some of them that don't,\n\n1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.320\n and some of them that do it faster,\n\n1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:42.840\n some of them that do it slower.\n\n1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.400\n And that's an economic decision that they'll make.\n\n1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:46.960\n I think their whole question is,\n\n1:42:46.960 --> 1:42:48.920\n is this a foregone conclusion?\n\n1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:51.120\n I mean, I think my answer is yes,\n\n1:42:51.120 --> 1:42:52.960\n this is definitely gonna be happening.\n\n1:42:52.960 --> 1:42:55.080\n I think they still have a question of,\n\n1:42:55.080 --> 1:42:58.560\n is this gonna change my industry?\n\n1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:03.480\n But I'm seeing a definite shift in people's understanding.\n\n1:43:03.480 --> 1:43:06.080\n And I think that shift is gonna accelerate rapidly\n\n1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:08.560\n as one or two of them of their competitors\n\n1:43:08.560 --> 1:43:11.800\n throw their hat in the smart contract ring\n\n1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:14.560\n and say, well, I have smart contracts.\n\n1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:17.320\n I guarantee my outcomes to you.\n\n1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:18.480\n What do they do for you?\n\n1:43:19.560 --> 1:43:22.040\n It's risky, just use mine.\n\n1:43:22.040 --> 1:43:24.280\n And the second some of them start losing business\n\n1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:27.720\n because of that, they're gonna move very quickly\n\n1:43:27.720 --> 1:43:30.080\n because that's what all of their compensation structures\n\n1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:32.960\n and all their goal planning structures are based around.\n\n1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:35.240\n They're based around what is losing us business\n\n1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:36.800\n or getting us business.\n\n1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:38.960\n Yeah, it's fascinating organizationally though,\n\n1:43:38.960 --> 1:43:41.920\n to think about banks, they're very old school\n\n1:43:41.920 --> 1:43:46.280\n and their ability to move quickly is questionable to me.\n\n1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:50.120\n I just look at basic online banking,\n\n1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:53.240\n like how good banks are creating\n\n1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:55.840\n a frictionless online experience.\n\n1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:58.640\n And I think they're not very good.\n\n1:43:58.640 --> 1:44:01.160\n And so that speaks to the kind of people\n\n1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:03.880\n who are in leadership positions at banks,\n\n1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:05.680\n the kind of people they hire,\n\n1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:07.520\n the kind of culture there is.\n\n1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.280\n So I do wonder if banks will from inside\n\n1:44:12.280 --> 1:44:15.440\n revolutionize themselves to include smart contracts\n\n1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:18.800\n or whether totally new competitors will have to emerge\n\n1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:22.320\n that basically create new kinds of banks.\n\n1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:26.200\n Whether, what is the company square?\n\n1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:30.360\n I think it comes up out of nowhere really with Cash App\n\n1:44:30.360 --> 1:44:31.840\n and they have Bitcoin on Cash App,\n\n1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:34.440\n whether they will start incorporating smart contracts\n\n1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:39.440\n and they will revolutionize the whole banking industry\n\n1:44:40.120 --> 1:44:44.640\n or whether Bank of America will revolutionize themselves\n\n1:44:44.640 --> 1:44:46.000\n from within.\n\n1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:50.040\n I'm skeptical on Bank of America, but you never know.\n\n1:44:50.040 --> 1:44:53.640\n In general, I'm fascinated by how big organizations,\n\n1:44:53.640 --> 1:44:56.760\n whether it's Google or Microsoft or Bank of America,\n\n1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:00.720\n pivot hard in a world that's quickly changing.\n\n1:45:00.720 --> 1:45:05.480\n I think that takes bold leadership and a lot of firing\n\n1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:08.120\n and a lot of pain and a lot of meetings\n\n1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:10.680\n where the one asshole brings up the\n\n1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:13.440\n from first principles idea that, you know what,\n\n1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:16.840\n the ways we've been doing stuff in the past require,\n\n1:45:16.840 --> 1:45:20.440\n we need to throw that out and do stuff totally differently.\n\n1:45:20.440 --> 1:45:22.440\n I know a lot of those assholes\n\n1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:25.320\n in a lot of these different industries.\n\n1:45:25.320 --> 1:45:27.040\n First of all, I think they're getting listened to more\n\n1:45:27.040 --> 1:45:30.480\n and second of all, I think all of these places,\n\n1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:32.400\n as I look at it more and more,\n\n1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:35.440\n I think they have a fundamental line of business\n\n1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:37.080\n that they try to protect\n\n1:45:37.080 --> 1:45:39.000\n and then everybody's compensation\n\n1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:40.400\n and everybody's metrics and goals\n\n1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:43.080\n is focused around that line of business.\n\n1:45:43.080 --> 1:45:48.080\n So the second that things begin to impact that,\n\n1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:52.520\n then everybody will be in a senior meeting\n\n1:45:52.520 --> 1:45:55.200\n and that asshole will be quite listened to\n\n1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:57.960\n because he will have the only thoughtful explanation\n\n1:45:57.960 --> 1:45:59.920\n as to why this is happening.\n\n1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:02.960\n How things will evolve from there, I actually don't know\n\n1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:05.760\n because that hasn't been the case yet.\n\n1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:08.720\n But my thinking is that there will be people\n\n1:46:08.720 --> 1:46:12.040\n who don't wanna cannibalize certain parts of their business\n\n1:46:12.040 --> 1:46:15.000\n or don't wanna change certain parts of their business\n\n1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:16.480\n and then there will be people who say,\n\n1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:18.960\n look, I think this is how the world's gonna work.\n\n1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:20.680\n We're gonna make a very, very heavy\n\n1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:27.320\n kind of set of commitments to put resources towards this.\n\n1:46:27.320 --> 1:46:29.880\n I already see that with a few banks\n\n1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:33.160\n working on various blockchain based systems,\n\n1:46:33.160 --> 1:46:34.880\n but granted, they've been working on those for years.\n\n1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:37.440\n So I think all of this comes down\n\n1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:39.880\n to these kind of quarterly earnings calls\n\n1:46:39.880 --> 1:46:44.040\n where somebody asks them, hey, I saw that bank over there\n\n1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:45.440\n once the blockchain bond\n\n1:46:45.440 --> 1:46:47.880\n or a smart contract derivative platform.\n\n1:46:47.880 --> 1:46:51.600\n And I also saw that they made $10 billion in revenues\n\n1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:55.040\n or $10 billion in volume or whatever it is from that.\n\n1:46:55.040 --> 1:46:58.080\n What's your plan on the earnings call?\n\n1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:00.560\n And I promise you by the next earnings call,\n\n1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:02.040\n there's a plan.\n\n1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:03.440\n And then the question on the next one is,\n\n1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:04.720\n well, when's the plan gonna happen?\n\n1:47:04.720 --> 1:47:06.000\n And then by the next earnings call,\n\n1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.440\n it's a plan is happening.\n\n1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:11.560\n And that's what these people are sensitive to.\n\n1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:13.760\n That's what these organizations are structured around.\n\n1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:17.200\n It's not completely economically like disconnected, right?\n\n1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:20.440\n They have this core business, they wanna protect it.\n\n1:47:20.440 --> 1:47:23.000\n I understand that idea,\n\n1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:26.040\n but I think that the problem with that\n\n1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:31.040\n is sometimes it requires this myopic focus, right?\n\n1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:34.520\n And that's what all the innovation stuff is about.\n\n1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:36.600\n Every time somebody at a corporate entity\n\n1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:40.280\n is about innovation, they're trying to sidestep this.\n\n1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:42.320\n But once again, the incentives to maintain\n\n1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:45.240\n whatever the core businesses is so strong\n\n1:47:45.240 --> 1:47:49.200\n that the innovation people, even though they are there,\n\n1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:53.840\n I think they get a phone call and go like,\n\n1:47:53.840 --> 1:47:55.560\n what are we doing for this?\n\n1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:58.560\n And the ones that actually did good work\n\n1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:00.600\n and got ready to do something for this\n\n1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:03.960\n have done their employer and their organization\n\n1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:05.800\n a very positive service.\n\n1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:07.800\n Whereas the ones that aren't ready,\n\n1:48:07.800 --> 1:48:09.920\n I mean, they'll make up something\n\n1:48:09.920 --> 1:48:11.920\n and maybe they're really smart and they'll get it together.\n\n1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:12.880\n I don't know.\n\n1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:15.200\n Can we talk about tokens a little bit?\n\n1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:19.600\n Generally speaking, there's been a meteoric rise\n\n1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:20.920\n of a bunch of different tokens.\n\n1:48:20.920 --> 1:48:24.240\n We could just talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum as examples.\n\n1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:27.960\n Bitcoin I think crossed $60,000 in value.\n\n1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:31.080\n What are your thoughts in general on this rise?\n\n1:48:31.080 --> 1:48:32.480\n What's the future of Bitcoin?\n\n1:48:32.480 --> 1:48:34.040\n What's the future of Ethereum?\n\n1:48:34.040 --> 1:48:38.880\n There's the total value locked metric\n\n1:48:38.880 --> 1:48:42.000\n that I think generalizes the different kind of value\n\n1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:45.280\n of these tokens.\n\n1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:51.000\n What does the future value and impact\n\n1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:52.360\n of cryptocurrency look like\n\n1:48:52.360 --> 1:48:54.920\n if we look through the lens of these tokens?\n\n1:48:56.040 --> 1:48:58.400\n I think valuing all these tokens\n\n1:48:58.400 --> 1:48:59.920\n and determining that isn't something\n\n1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:01.280\n I'm particularly great at.\n\n1:49:01.280 --> 1:49:02.960\n I haven't spent a lot of time on that.\n\n1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:05.240\n I've spent the vast majority of my time\n\n1:49:05.240 --> 1:49:07.800\n on building these systems and architecting them\n\n1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:09.960\n and getting them to fruition and getting them to a place\n\n1:49:09.960 --> 1:49:12.400\n where they operate properly on both the technical\n\n1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:15.560\n and the crypto economic and in every other sense.\n\n1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:17.160\n I think with Bitcoin,\n\n1:49:17.160 --> 1:49:21.640\n there is a certain conception\n\n1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:24.440\n of non governmental fiat money\n\n1:49:24.440 --> 1:49:28.840\n that Bitcoin is really the first creator of, right?\n\n1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:31.960\n So there's this very powerful idea called fiat money.\n\n1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:36.920\n It's basically more or less a kind of 40 year experiment.\n\n1:49:36.920 --> 1:49:38.480\n I think on August 15th of this year\n\n1:49:38.480 --> 1:49:41.320\n is maybe I think given the 40th anniversary,\n\n1:49:41.320 --> 1:49:42.960\n government can say, hey, I have a currency\n\n1:49:42.960 --> 1:49:46.160\n and it's worth something and here it is.\n\n1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:50.800\n In terms of the way that governments have stopped that\n\n1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:52.480\n in the past is if anyone tries to make\n\n1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:54.440\n another fiat currency in their country,\n\n1:49:54.440 --> 1:49:56.440\n they immediately shut it down, right?\n\n1:49:56.440 --> 1:49:58.920\n They immediately say, hey, this is really bad.\n\n1:49:58.920 --> 1:50:00.440\n You've done something really bad.\n\n1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:01.640\n It's time for you to stop.\n\n1:50:01.640 --> 1:50:03.000\n Don't do it anymore.\n\n1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:04.200\n And it stops, right?\n\n1:50:04.200 --> 1:50:07.800\n That's been the history of non governmental fiat currency.\n\n1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:12.160\n Bitcoin is really due to its decentralized nature,\n\n1:50:12.160 --> 1:50:15.240\n the first and possibly in some cases,\n\n1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:16.120\n in many people's minds,\n\n1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:19.720\n it's still the only true non governmental fiat currency.\n\n1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:24.400\n Now, how powerful is non governmental fiat currency?\n\n1:50:24.400 --> 1:50:26.360\n I have no idea, right?\n\n1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:31.360\n This is why so it's really as powerful as the ideas\n\n1:50:31.360 --> 1:50:33.440\n that people ascribe to it are, right?\n\n1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:36.720\n So let's say people start saying,\n\n1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:37.960\n like right now people are saying,\n\n1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:39.240\n hey, it's internet money.\n\n1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:41.600\n It's the money of the internet.\n\n1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:42.600\n Okay, great.\n\n1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:43.440\n What's that worth?\n\n1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:44.280\n I don't know.\n\n1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:45.120\n It's probably worth a lot.\n\n1:50:45.120 --> 1:50:45.960\n I have no idea what it's worth,\n\n1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:50.960\n but as an idea, as a concept to underpin the fiat money,\n\n1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:56.120\n the let there be aspect of fiat and of Bitcoin,\n\n1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:58.400\n you basically look at it and you say,\n\n1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:00.040\n yeah, internet money.\n\n1:51:00.040 --> 1:51:02.400\n Okay, that could be worth whatever,\n\n1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:06.040\n 60,000, 600,000, great question, right?\n\n1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.600\n There are other versions of the world, right?\n\n1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:09.720\n Where people say,\n\n1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:14.520\n there are countries that don't have a good fiat currency\n\n1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.920\n and I see a lot of people using Bitcoin.\n\n1:51:16.920 --> 1:51:19.400\n So Bitcoin isn't internet money,\n\n1:51:19.400 --> 1:51:24.120\n it's countries without a good currency money.\n\n1:51:24.120 --> 1:51:25.800\n So all the countries without a good currency\n\n1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:29.200\n now use Bitcoin and let there be,\n\n1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:31.880\n Bitcoin as this, right?\n\n1:51:31.880 --> 1:51:33.160\n As this conception of Bitcoin.\n\n1:51:33.160 --> 1:51:34.640\n What's the value of that?\n\n1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:35.480\n I don't know.\n\n1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:36.320\n That's a great question.\n\n1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:37.720\n Probably huge amount of value.\n\n1:51:39.040 --> 1:51:42.680\n Then there's a further conception of Bitcoin\n\n1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:45.000\n as some digital gold.\n\n1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:46.600\n There's a scarcity dynamic.\n\n1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:49.480\n There's all these other kinds of dynamics.\n\n1:51:49.480 --> 1:51:52.600\n What is a portable version of digital gold\n\n1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:57.600\n with some kind of built in scarcity worth?\n\n1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:01.040\n You know, kind of artificially created scarcity.\n\n1:52:01.040 --> 1:52:01.880\n What's that worth?\n\n1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:04.200\n I don't know.\n\n1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:05.760\n That's a great question.\n\n1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:07.920\n I haven't done the analysis on that is the point,\n\n1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:09.400\n might be worth a lot.\n\n1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:13.280\n What is it all worth if all three of these things,\n\n1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:16.200\n you know, flow into the same fiat,\n\n1:52:16.200 --> 1:52:18.000\n kind of let there be Bitcoin\n\n1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.680\n as these three things conception of Bitcoin?\n\n1:52:21.840 --> 1:52:22.680\n I don't know what that's worth.\n\n1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:23.520\n I also don't know what that's worth,\n\n1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:25.840\n but could be worth a huge amount.\n\n1:52:25.840 --> 1:52:28.080\n So I think it's not,\n\n1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:28.920\n I don't think it's,\n\n1:52:28.920 --> 1:52:30.200\n I personally don't think it's super important\n\n1:52:30.200 --> 1:52:31.360\n what I think it's worth\n\n1:52:31.360 --> 1:52:33.520\n or what many other people think it's worth.\n\n1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:35.560\n I don't think that's really that important.\n\n1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:37.240\n I think what's probably important\n\n1:52:37.240 --> 1:52:42.240\n is understanding what the societal conception of Bitcoin is\n\n1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:48.440\n and how does that societal conception evolve over time.\n\n1:52:49.640 --> 1:52:51.200\n And that interestingly enough,\n\n1:52:51.200 --> 1:52:54.280\n doesn't just depend on, you know,\n\n1:52:54.280 --> 1:52:58.120\n you or me or the people who made Bitcoin or anything else.\n\n1:52:58.120 --> 1:53:00.720\n It actually depends on current events.\n\n1:53:00.720 --> 1:53:02.720\n So for example, if people suddenly say,\n\n1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:05.960\n I'm more and more worried about fiat currency.\n\n1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:09.400\n I'm more and more worried that governmental fiat,\n\n1:53:09.400 --> 1:53:12.520\n even if it's the most reliable version of that\n\n1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:14.560\n is not as good as I thought it was.\n\n1:53:14.560 --> 1:53:17.800\n Maybe I should go on the PayPal app\n\n1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:20.440\n and maybe I should get some Bitcoin just in case.\n\n1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:25.440\n What's the world where Bitcoin is a certain percentage\n\n1:53:25.800 --> 1:53:28.080\n of everyone's ownership as a hedge\n\n1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:32.800\n against governmental fiat money not being so good?\n\n1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:35.200\n Haven't done the analysis, but another example, right?\n\n1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:38.320\n Here's this conception, that's the conception.\n\n1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:40.040\n So when I look at Bitcoin,\n\n1:53:40.040 --> 1:53:43.680\n what I see is a lot of these fascinating conceptions\n\n1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:47.680\n of what the fiat, let there be value of Bitcoin is.\n\n1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.760\n By the way, all of them could be true.\n\n1:53:50.760 --> 1:53:51.880\n Maybe some of them are true.\n\n1:53:51.880 --> 1:53:53.400\n Maybe some of them aren't true.\n\n1:53:53.400 --> 1:53:54.920\n And the fascinating thing is that\n\n1:53:54.920 --> 1:53:56.920\n I've seen this conception change, right?\n\n1:53:56.920 --> 1:53:59.040\n So when I started in the Bitcoin space,\n\n1:53:59.040 --> 1:54:01.960\n the conception was micropayments.\n\n1:54:01.960 --> 1:54:05.400\n The cost of Bitcoin is low, we'll have micropayments.\n\n1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:09.080\n Micropayments are wonderful for machine to machine\n\n1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:10.800\n transactions, micropayments are wonderful.\n\n1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:13.400\n The emerging market, and that's fine, right?\n\n1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:15.760\n And that was one conception of Bitcoin\n\n1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:19.600\n as let there be Bitcoin as micropayments platform, right?\n\n1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:21.880\n But then the value rose and things changed.\n\n1:54:21.880 --> 1:54:24.000\n There wasn't enough expansion in certain ways.\n\n1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.600\n And now the conception has evolved\n\n1:54:26.600 --> 1:54:28.520\n into this other conception.\n\n1:54:28.520 --> 1:54:30.760\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:34.640\n I think governments have a very clear set of steps\n\n1:54:34.640 --> 1:54:39.640\n for directing the public's conception of their fiat, right?\n\n1:54:40.320 --> 1:54:44.240\n They say our fiat is worth this for these reasons.\n\n1:54:44.240 --> 1:54:45.640\n Bitcoin doesn't have that.\n\n1:54:45.640 --> 1:54:49.240\n Bitcoin doesn't have an official Bitcoin spokesperson\n\n1:54:49.240 --> 1:54:50.760\n that goes out and says,\n\n1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:53.200\n the non governmental money called Bitcoin,\n\n1:54:53.200 --> 1:54:55.360\n the non governmental fiat money called Bitcoin\n\n1:54:55.360 --> 1:54:57.960\n has value on the basis of this, this, this and this.\n\n1:54:57.960 --> 1:55:00.720\n Here's our fiscal budget, here's our future plans.\n\n1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:04.080\n Our money will continue to be safe and secure and reliable.\n\n1:55:04.080 --> 1:55:07.360\n And so what that hole creates\n\n1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:09.120\n is a hole that we all fill, right?\n\n1:55:09.120 --> 1:55:12.360\n We all basically come to some vague kind of\n\n1:55:12.360 --> 1:55:16.680\n group understanding that Bitcoin is worth this\n\n1:55:16.680 --> 1:55:20.880\n because it is tied to,\n\n1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:27.480\n let's say all non governmental fiat money comes\n\n1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:30.360\n into question, everybody doubts it,\n\n1:55:30.360 --> 1:55:32.240\n possibly due to inflation.\n\n1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:35.480\n And everybody says, you know, this is nice,\n\n1:55:35.480 --> 1:55:39.440\n but I'd like to keep 10, 20% of my wealth\n\n1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:42.920\n in non governmental fiat, just in case,\n\n1:55:44.360 --> 1:55:46.280\n you know, what are those numbers?\n\n1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:49.280\n I mean, if that happens, you know,\n\n1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:51.160\n I'm guessing you can add a few zeros.\n\n1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:55.040\n I like how you say I haven't done the analysis\n\n1:55:55.040 --> 1:55:56.920\n as if I'm sure a lot of people have done\n\n1:55:56.920 --> 1:55:59.360\n quote unquote analysis, but it's not,\n\n1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:00.520\n it's still speculation.\n\n1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:02.080\n Nobody can predict the future,\n\n1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:04.800\n especially when so much of it has to do\n\n1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:08.600\n with a large number of people holding an idea\n\n1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:10.720\n in their mind as to the importance\n\n1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:13.360\n of a particular technology like Bitcoin.\n\n1:56:13.360 --> 1:56:15.400\n There's a lot of excitement by its possibilities,\n\n1:56:15.400 --> 1:56:19.480\n but the number of zeros you add is an open question\n\n1:56:19.480 --> 1:56:22.040\n and nobody can do a perfect analysis\n\n1:56:22.040 --> 1:56:24.440\n except whoever created this simulation.\n\n1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:28.680\n Let me ask you this question.\n\n1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:33.160\n Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\n\n1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:38.160\n There's quite a few people who suggest that person is you.\n\n1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.680\n So is it you?\n\n1:56:42.680 --> 1:56:43.520\n No.\n\n1:56:45.200 --> 1:56:46.600\n Who do you think it could be?\n\n1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:48.640\n I don't know who it is.\n\n1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:52.080\n I think if I had to guess, it's probably a group of people,\n\n1:56:52.080 --> 1:56:55.240\n some of which might not even be around anymore.\n\n1:56:55.240 --> 1:56:57.400\n You know, obviously I'm very grateful to,\n\n1:56:57.400 --> 1:56:59.200\n if this is a singular or a group of people\n\n1:56:59.200 --> 1:57:00.680\n for kicking off this entire industry\n\n1:57:00.680 --> 1:57:02.800\n and making this amazing change in the world\n\n1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:05.480\n that I have the privilege and luxury\n\n1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:08.480\n of being part of in some small way in the work that I do.\n\n1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.440\n I think also this kind of focus on who is Satoshi\n\n1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:14.920\n or who isn't Satoshi,\n\n1:57:14.920 --> 1:57:17.640\n shouldn't in my opinion matter so much\n\n1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:20.040\n because regardless of who it is,\n\n1:57:20.040 --> 1:57:24.080\n that in my opinion should have no substantial\n\n1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:27.760\n significant effect or bearing on the functioning\n\n1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:29.560\n or the value or the use\n\n1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:33.480\n or the security of the Bitcoin system, right?\n\n1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:35.840\n So I think whoever it is,\n\n1:57:35.840 --> 1:57:38.880\n they're probably better off not making that public.\n\n1:57:38.880 --> 1:57:40.240\n And I think beyond that,\n\n1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.760\n whoever it turned out to be shouldn't matter\n\n1:57:43.760 --> 1:57:46.360\n because it has nothing to do\n\n1:57:46.360 --> 1:57:48.640\n with how the system is made useful\n\n1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:50.760\n or secure or anything else.\n\n1:57:50.760 --> 1:57:54.480\n And so I think that's the point of view that I have.\n\n1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:58.160\n Now, if you were Satoshi Nakamoto, would you tell me?\n\n1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:02.160\n Because you said they shouldn't,\n\n1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:05.440\n whoever Satoshi is, you should keep that private.\n\n1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:08.320\n So would you tell it to me or no?\n\n1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:12.040\n We're in some kind of weird like thought experiment here.\n\n1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:16.960\n If I was this guy, let me think about this,\n\n1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:19.200\n which I'm not, by the way, I am not this person.\n\n1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:21.560\n But if you were, would you say it?\n\n1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:26.560\n I think probably not.\n\n1:58:29.360 --> 1:58:30.200\n I don't see the,\n\n1:58:30.200 --> 1:58:33.000\n I think that they would cause a lot of distraction\n\n1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:34.920\n and a lot of weird stuff.\n\n1:58:34.920 --> 1:58:38.880\n And so realistically, I don't think it would help anybody\n\n1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:40.800\n or even the person who discloses it,\n\n1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:42.480\n but just to be clear, I am not.\n\n1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:45.000\n And whoever it is, I think they haven't said anything\n\n1:58:45.000 --> 1:58:46.520\n because they don't want the attention\n\n1:58:46.520 --> 1:58:47.920\n and they don't want the distraction\n\n1:58:47.920 --> 1:58:49.800\n and they don't want all the problems from this.\n\n1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:53.040\n And that makes sense to me, conceptually.\n\n1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:55.160\n It's fascinating to think if they're still out there\n\n1:58:55.160 --> 1:58:58.760\n and part of the Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency community,\n\n1:59:00.600 --> 1:59:04.920\n and it is inspiring to think that if they're out there,\n\n1:59:04.920 --> 1:59:09.080\n that they're not revealing their identity\n\n1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:11.360\n because it would be a distraction.\n\n1:59:11.360 --> 1:59:13.040\n That's kind of inspiring that people are like that.\n\n1:59:13.040 --> 1:59:15.400\n Just like George Washington,\n\n1:59:15.400 --> 1:59:17.960\n a relinquishing power is inspiring\n\n1:59:17.960 --> 1:59:20.560\n because it's ultimately about the progress of the community\n\n1:59:20.560 --> 1:59:24.000\n and not some kind of ego driven attention scheme.\n\n1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:26.360\n Again, very inspiring.\n\n1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:29.720\n The humans at their best are inspiring.\n\n1:59:29.720 --> 1:59:31.680\n What do you think about the certainty\n\n1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:34.720\n that people in the Bitcoin Maximus community\n\n1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:37.680\n have about this particular piece of technology, Bitcoin?\n\n1:59:38.640 --> 1:59:41.520\n Is there something interesting that you think\n\n1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:44.360\n that you might wanna say about this community\n\n1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:48.720\n or is it just is what it is?\n\n1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:49.760\n I think at the end of the day,\n\n1:59:49.760 --> 1:59:51.720\n results speak for themselves\n\n1:59:51.720 --> 1:59:55.880\n and Bitcoin has had an amazing impact on our industry\n\n1:59:55.880 --> 1:59:59.000\n and has had an amazing impact on the world.\n\n1:59:59.000 --> 2:00:01.120\n And I think the result is still\n\n2:00:01.120 --> 2:00:03.440\n that Bitcoin is very widely adopted\n\n2:00:03.440 --> 2:00:07.240\n and driving the adoption of our industry in many ways.\n\n2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:08.920\n So I think it's very difficult for people to say\n\n2:00:08.920 --> 2:00:12.800\n that Bitcoin maximalists don't have something\n\n2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:14.040\n that they can latch onto and say,\n\n2:00:14.040 --> 2:00:16.280\n hey, there's something very real here.\n\n2:00:16.280 --> 2:00:18.400\n I think there's been decisions made\n\n2:00:18.400 --> 2:00:19.920\n by the Bitcoin community\n\n2:00:19.920 --> 2:00:21.800\n and the people who made the Bitcoin protocol\n\n2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:24.360\n to focus it on Bitcoin\n\n2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:28.120\n and to focus it on the kind of storing\n\n2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:29.680\n of the ledger of Bitcoin\n\n2:00:29.680 --> 2:00:31.200\n and the information about Bitcoin\n\n2:00:31.200 --> 2:00:32.440\n and the transaction of Bitcoin\n\n2:00:32.440 --> 2:00:34.800\n and to focus on securing that.\n\n2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:37.480\n And I understand why that decision was made\n\n2:00:37.480 --> 2:00:38.480\n to a certain degree, right?\n\n2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:39.880\n It was about focus.\n\n2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:43.000\n It was about getting something worthwhile right\n\n2:00:43.000 --> 2:00:46.680\n without adding additional features and additional risk.\n\n2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:49.880\n And that decision is a decision that was made\n\n2:00:49.880 --> 2:00:53.680\n and has kind of the benefits of focus\n\n2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:57.360\n and the benefits of a certain amount of security\n\n2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:01.040\n and a certain amount of guarantees around Bitcoin\n\n2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:04.280\n and what that is and the value of that.\n\n2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:07.680\n And then it has certain limitations\n\n2:01:07.680 --> 2:01:10.760\n as a consequence of doing less\n\n2:01:10.760 --> 2:01:12.360\n or having the system hold data\n\n2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:13.600\n that isn't related to Bitcoin\n\n2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.800\n or not having the system hold contractual outcomes\n\n2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:19.840\n or smart contract code.\n\n2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:21.960\n So I think it's just kind of a decision, right?\n\n2:01:21.960 --> 2:01:24.600\n And I understand why they're excited\n\n2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:25.480\n and I'm very excited.\n\n2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:28.240\n I started in this industry going to Bitcoin meetups\n\n2:01:28.240 --> 2:01:30.200\n and I met a lot of fantastic people,\n\n2:01:30.200 --> 2:01:32.800\n libertarian people that wanted\n\n2:01:32.800 --> 2:01:34.400\n to see the world work differently\n\n2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:35.720\n and shared a lot of my beliefs\n\n2:01:35.720 --> 2:01:37.560\n and a lot of my points of view.\n\n2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:40.000\n And so anyone who's been in the industry\n\n2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:44.120\n as long as I have has had to come\n\n2:01:44.120 --> 2:01:45.280\n from the Bitcoin ecosystem\n\n2:01:45.280 --> 2:01:48.200\n by virtue of kind of starting out that early.\n\n2:01:48.200 --> 2:01:50.640\n So I have an unbelievable amount of respect\n\n2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:55.000\n and admiration and gratitude for Bitcoin\n\n2:01:55.000 --> 2:01:56.560\n and that it exists and everything that it's done\n\n2:01:56.560 --> 2:01:58.080\n and that it birthed this industry.\n\n2:01:58.080 --> 2:01:59.960\n There's absolutely no doubt about that.\n\n2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:04.440\n At the same time, whatever design decisions people make\n\n2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:07.000\n are the design decisions they make, right?\n\n2:02:07.000 --> 2:02:08.960\n And so if you've made a design decision\n\n2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:11.880\n that this ledger and this thing will be about Bitcoin,\n\n2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:13.880\n it won't be about colored coins,\n\n2:02:13.880 --> 2:02:16.480\n it won't be about op return at 80 bytes,\n\n2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:20.480\n it won't be about these other kind of nuances\n\n2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:23.680\n that you don't want this to be about, then that's fine.\n\n2:02:23.680 --> 2:02:26.720\n That's fine and that's a logical decision\n\n2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:28.120\n and it's called focus.\n\n2:02:28.120 --> 2:02:30.120\n And focus has a lot of value\n\n2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:32.680\n and a lot of great technology products\n\n2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:36.520\n have focused on something and done that.\n\n2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:39.040\n And then there's a lot of smart people around Bitcoin\n\n2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:41.800\n building kind of additional systems\n\n2:02:41.800 --> 2:02:44.200\n that anchor their security within Bitcoin.\n\n2:02:44.200 --> 2:02:45.920\n And I think that's an interesting approach\n\n2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:47.520\n that could bear fruit.\n\n2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:51.080\n I think it'll eventually require an interaction\n\n2:02:51.080 --> 2:02:54.280\n with a Bitcoin protocol in more advanced ways.\n\n2:02:54.280 --> 2:02:56.160\n And then there will be another question of,\n\n2:02:56.160 --> 2:02:58.960\n what is the design decision for Bitcoin?\n\n2:02:58.960 --> 2:03:02.520\n Is it that Bitcoin will be just about the Bitcoin ledger?\n\n2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:05.200\n Or does Bitcoin want to evolve\n\n2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:10.200\n into an anchor for all these other systems\n\n2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:13.200\n and maybe create additional data store,\n\n2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:15.440\n kind of more data on chain,\n\n2:03:15.440 --> 2:03:18.240\n on the Bitcoin blockchain related to that?\n\n2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:20.520\n So I'm excited to see how that evolves,\n\n2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:23.520\n but until then kind of results speak for themselves\n\n2:03:23.520 --> 2:03:25.760\n and the results that Bitcoin has achieved\n\n2:03:25.760 --> 2:03:27.120\n for our industry and for itself\n\n2:03:27.120 --> 2:03:30.200\n as kind of the dominant cryptocurrency\n\n2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:31.880\n and the conception of our industry\n\n2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:33.720\n that people interact with first\n\n2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:36.280\n is obviously very important and something\n\n2:03:36.280 --> 2:03:39.080\n that I think really everybody in our industry\n\n2:03:39.080 --> 2:03:40.080\n is grateful for, right?\n\n2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:43.880\n Because without Bitcoin, where would our industry be?\n\n2:03:43.880 --> 2:03:46.840\n And that's obviously something that we can't forget.\n\n2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:49.400\n What are your thoughts about Ethereum\n\n2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:54.320\n in the chain link distributed Oracle network world?\n\n2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:57.240\n Is it competition?\n\n2:03:57.240 --> 2:03:59.320\n Is it collaboration?\n\n2:03:59.320 --> 2:04:02.120\n Is it complimentary technology?\n\n2:04:02.120 --> 2:04:03.400\n What do you think about Ethereum?\n\n2:04:03.400 --> 2:04:05.200\n How much do you think about Ethereum?\n\n2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:07.040\n What role does it have?\n\n2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:08.400\n Yeah, I think about a lot.\n\n2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:11.040\n I think we're completely complimentary.\n\n2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:13.840\n So there's no competitive dynamics in my opinion.\n\n2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:16.320\n We are completely collaborative and complimentary\n\n2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:18.720\n with Ethereum and all other blockchains\n\n2:04:18.720 --> 2:04:22.960\n and all other layer twos that operate a contract, right?\n\n2:04:22.960 --> 2:04:26.120\n So we do not seek to operate a smart contract.\n\n2:04:26.120 --> 2:04:29.800\n We seek to augment and enable smart contracts\n\n2:04:29.800 --> 2:04:32.840\n to go further in what they're able to do.\n\n2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:35.960\n In fact, Oracle networks have some value,\n\n2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:38.360\n but they don't have nearly as much value in what they do\n\n2:04:38.360 --> 2:04:40.480\n if there isn't a mission critical system\n\n2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:43.320\n like a smart contract that needs their data, right?\n\n2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:46.000\n So we've made our own explicit design decisions\n\n2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.560\n in our own and created our own focus\n\n2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:53.560\n around guaranteeing that smart contracts can go further.\n\n2:04:53.760 --> 2:04:54.840\n We've already done that, right?\n\n2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:57.760\n Decentralized finance, the rate at which we put data\n\n2:04:57.760 --> 2:04:59.280\n is to a degree the rate at which certain\n\n2:04:59.280 --> 2:05:01.360\n decentralized financial markets grow.\n\n2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:03.160\n And as we put more data, we see more\n\n2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:05.920\n financial products go live, gaming, we provide VRF.\n\n2:05:05.920 --> 2:05:08.880\n So we have this kind of focus and it's a very useful\n\n2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:13.680\n and valuable kind of, valuable for our industry focus.\n\n2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:18.440\n At the end of the day, I think that smart contract platforms\n\n2:05:18.440 --> 2:05:22.400\n like Ethereum made a different set of design decisions\n\n2:05:22.400 --> 2:05:23.440\n from Bitcoin and others.\n\n2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:27.520\n And they focused on creating the smart contract capability\n\n2:05:27.520 --> 2:05:32.520\n and they kind of wanted that functionality to exist.\n\n2:05:32.680 --> 2:05:34.360\n And I think since then, there's been a number of people\n\n2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:37.920\n that try to improve on that or try to make variants of that.\n\n2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:41.840\n From our point of view, we want to support smart contracts\n\n2:05:41.840 --> 2:05:46.360\n in all of their variations and in all of their use cases.\n\n2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:49.200\n So one of the things that I personally like about Chainlink\n\n2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:52.400\n is their ability or Chainlink's ability\n\n2:05:52.400 --> 2:05:54.320\n and the Chainlink network's ability to be useful\n\n2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:58.400\n to many different chains and across many different use cases.\n\n2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:00.400\n I'm personally a fan of Ethereum.\n\n2:06:00.400 --> 2:06:03.200\n Ethereum has done a huge amount for our industry as well.\n\n2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:06.400\n Ethereum took us from a world where it literally took months\n\n2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:08.720\n to make a new smart contract by being forced\n\n2:06:08.720 --> 2:06:10.960\n to code it into a protocol.\n\n2:06:10.960 --> 2:06:12.560\n You had to go to the protocol developers\n\n2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:15.360\n and you had to say, hey, I need a DEX\n\n2:06:15.360 --> 2:06:17.360\n or I need some kind of smart contract.\n\n2:06:17.360 --> 2:06:19.320\n Put it in the protocol itself.\n\n2:06:19.320 --> 2:06:21.880\n Put it in the actual blockchain mining\n\n2:06:21.880 --> 2:06:25.360\n and kind of block generation, transaction generation protocol.\n\n2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:27.640\n That would take months or sometimes even over a year.\n\n2:06:27.640 --> 2:06:29.040\n That was a horrible experience\n\n2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:31.600\n and obviously very few people wanted to participate in that\n\n2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:33.760\n and so very few people made smart contracts,\n\n2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:35.880\n which I was not a fan of, right?\n\n2:06:35.880 --> 2:06:37.160\n And then Ethereum came along\n\n2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:39.680\n and really did a lot of innovative things\n\n2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:43.360\n and introduced this approach to scriptable smart contracts\n\n2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:46.960\n where you could script all of these different conditions.\n\n2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:49.720\n And I found that fascinating before Ethereum.\n\n2:06:49.720 --> 2:06:51.680\n I found that fascinating once Ethereum\n\n2:06:51.680 --> 2:06:54.400\n arrived, I found it fascinating after Ethereum launched\n\n2:06:54.400 --> 2:06:55.680\n and I still find it fascinating.\n\n2:06:55.680 --> 2:06:58.640\n And I'm also very grateful to Vitalik\n\n2:06:58.640 --> 2:07:01.320\n and the Ethereum community and all the core developers there\n\n2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:03.960\n for taking our industry a step further.\n\n2:07:03.960 --> 2:07:06.640\n So I think they absolutely deserve a huge amount of credit\n\n2:07:06.640 --> 2:07:10.080\n for taking our industry from it takes months\n\n2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:12.160\n to make a really small smart contract\n\n2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:15.920\n to it takes weeks to make a relatively secure,\n\n2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:18.240\n relatively advanced piece of on chain code\n\n2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:21.560\n that anybody can script and people can do audits on\n\n2:07:21.560 --> 2:07:25.560\n and that's an unbelievable leap forward for our industry\n\n2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:28.240\n and I'm genuinely grateful to them for that.\n\n2:07:29.200 --> 2:07:32.160\n I think the next step in line with our body of work\n\n2:07:32.160 --> 2:07:36.400\n is how does that scriptable on chain code\n\n2:07:36.400 --> 2:07:40.080\n become more advanced in its interaction\n\n2:07:40.080 --> 2:07:44.360\n with all of the systems and events in the real world,\n\n2:07:44.360 --> 2:07:47.080\n which is in my opinion, the final missing piece\n\n2:07:47.080 --> 2:07:48.320\n of the puzzle, right?\n\n2:07:48.320 --> 2:07:51.160\n So my body of work, the body of work that I'm involved in\n\n2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:52.520\n would not be where it is right now\n\n2:07:52.520 --> 2:07:54.560\n without Bitcoin by any measure.\n\n2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:57.080\n It wouldn't even be where it is now without Ethereum\n\n2:07:57.080 --> 2:07:59.640\n and the growth in smart contract development\n\n2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:01.320\n that they've created.\n\n2:08:01.320 --> 2:08:04.760\n And now what I think is gonna happen next\n\n2:08:04.760 --> 2:08:07.520\n is there'll be a lot of different smart contract platforms,\n\n2:08:07.520 --> 2:08:09.240\n a lot of different layer twos,\n\n2:08:09.240 --> 2:08:10.960\n some of them will be private for enterprise,\n\n2:08:10.960 --> 2:08:12.440\n some of them will be public,\n\n2:08:12.440 --> 2:08:15.080\n there'll be some public winners in certain geographies\n\n2:08:15.080 --> 2:08:18.000\n for maybe regulation reasons, maybe other reasons,\n\n2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.840\n there'll be other public winners, the larger internet,\n\n2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:23.480\n and there'll be a number of different people\n\n2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:26.480\n building smart contracts in different languages.\n\n2:08:26.480 --> 2:08:29.160\n We are excited and I am excited\n\n2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:30.840\n and the Chainlink community is excited\n\n2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:33.280\n and basically there's a lot of,\n\n2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:36.960\n I mean, for lack of a better word, excitement\n\n2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:39.960\n in seeing our industry graduate\n\n2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:43.840\n to providing more use cases,\n\n2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:46.720\n more usable hybrid smart contracts, right?\n\n2:08:46.720 --> 2:08:49.200\n Because once again, it's absolutely amazing\n\n2:08:49.200 --> 2:08:51.680\n that Bitcoin created non governmental fiat money.\n\n2:08:51.680 --> 2:08:53.280\n It's an unbelievable innovation\n\n2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:55.760\n and invented decentralized infrastructure\n\n2:08:55.760 --> 2:08:57.440\n and birthed our industry.\n\n2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:00.280\n It's an unbelievably great achievement,\n\n2:09:00.280 --> 2:09:01.960\n an amazing achievement that we now have\n\n2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:04.600\n scriptable smart contracts through something like Ethereum.\n\n2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:07.640\n Once again, monumental achievement in my opinion.\n\n2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:10.720\n Once again, we still need to look to the future.\n\n2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:13.440\n We need to look to how do we take\n\n2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:16.040\n the decentralized infrastructure concepts\n\n2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:17.840\n that Bitcoin initially put forward,\n\n2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:19.600\n that Ethereum then improved upon\n\n2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:23.320\n and created into these scriptable smart contract formats,\n\n2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:25.960\n and how do we expand that into the world\n\n2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:28.640\n of real world outcomes to change\n\n2:09:28.640 --> 2:09:31.280\n the global financial industry, the global trade industry,\n\n2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:33.480\n the global data marketplace industry,\n\n2:09:34.360 --> 2:09:36.160\n and many other global industries.\n\n2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:38.240\n You mentioned results speak for themselves\n\n2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:41.600\n and how design decisions have consequences.\n\n2:09:43.000 --> 2:09:44.880\n The Chainlink community have come up\n\n2:09:44.880 --> 2:09:48.040\n with a lot of brilliant designs.\n\n2:09:48.040 --> 2:09:51.640\n So how do you think through the design choices\n\n2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:55.440\n that you're facing where you can't predict the future,\n\n2:09:55.440 --> 2:09:58.600\n but you're trying to create a better future?\n\n2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:03.600\n Is there something low level introspective advice\n\n2:10:05.080 --> 2:10:06.680\n that you can give or describe\n\n2:10:06.680 --> 2:10:09.040\n as to how you think through those decisions\n\n2:10:09.040 --> 2:10:12.040\n or high level how you think about those decisions?\n\n2:10:12.040 --> 2:10:14.040\n Sure, absolutely.\n\n2:10:14.040 --> 2:10:16.160\n I think that's a great question.\n\n2:10:16.160 --> 2:10:18.360\n And I think that actually gets to the core\n\n2:10:18.360 --> 2:10:22.160\n of what the Chainlink network is supposed to achieve.\n\n2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:27.160\n We are supposed to achieve a maximally flexible system.\n\n2:10:27.400 --> 2:10:28.960\n So once again, this is the big difference\n\n2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:31.600\n between Chainlink and Oracle networks in general\n\n2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:33.560\n and blockchains in my opinion.\n\n2:10:33.560 --> 2:10:36.360\n Blockchains do not seek to be maximally flexible, right?\n\n2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:39.320\n They say, here's my block size,\n\n2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:43.920\n here's the transaction types you can put in those blocks.\n\n2:10:43.920 --> 2:10:46.160\n Here's the contract language I have.\n\n2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:48.600\n Here's kind of my blockchain system, right?\n\n2:10:49.840 --> 2:10:51.640\n Here's the fee structure for those blocks.\n\n2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:54.760\n They're gonna keep getting kind of composed,\n\n2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.440\n transactions are gonna get put into blocks,\n\n2:10:56.440 --> 2:10:58.360\n blocks will get connected and it'll continue, right?\n\n2:10:58.360 --> 2:11:00.400\n And that's a very focused type of system.\n\n2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:01.240\n And that's great.\n\n2:11:01.240 --> 2:11:03.040\n And that makes sense because it's focused\n\n2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:05.880\n on creating security for that category\n\n2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:08.320\n of on chain activity, which is once again,\n\n2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:10.280\n a critical, critical part of building\n\n2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:12.280\n a highly transparent system and something\n\n2:11:12.280 --> 2:11:14.920\n that Chainlink enables and doesn't compete with\n\n2:11:14.920 --> 2:11:16.320\n and just enables to do more.\n\n2:11:17.360 --> 2:11:21.360\n Oracle networks, conversely, have to interact\n\n2:11:21.360 --> 2:11:25.520\n with all the world's data and provide all the services\n\n2:11:25.520 --> 2:11:27.200\n that blockchains don't provide, right?\n\n2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.520\n So there's kind of a spectrum.\n\n2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:31.000\n On one end of the spectrum, you have blockchains\n\n2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:33.360\n that are highly secure, highly reliable,\n\n2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:36.600\n highly tamper proof, highly transparent,\n\n2:11:36.600 --> 2:11:38.480\n but are not very feature rich.\n\n2:11:38.480 --> 2:11:41.000\n For example, they cannot talk to an API.\n\n2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:42.520\n Many of them can't generate randomness.\n\n2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:46.160\n They cannot do some kind of privacy preserving computation.\n\n2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:47.440\n So they're very secure.\n\n2:11:47.440 --> 2:11:50.200\n And there are these kind of data structures\n\n2:11:50.200 --> 2:11:53.880\n and smart contract platforms to hold on chain code\n\n2:11:53.880 --> 2:11:57.280\n that can define conditions, receive value,\n\n2:11:57.280 --> 2:11:59.280\n pay value back out under conditions\n\n2:11:59.280 --> 2:12:01.000\n and create transparency around all that,\n\n2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:03.040\n which makes perfect sense.\n\n2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:06.720\n And then there's oracles and oracle networks.\n\n2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:08.560\n That is all the world's data, right?\n\n2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:11.320\n We're talking about taking all the world's data\n\n2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:14.840\n and making it consumable for all the world's use cases\n\n2:12:14.840 --> 2:12:16.520\n that have trust issues.\n\n2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:19.400\n So the amount of variability there is absolutely massive,\n\n2:12:19.400 --> 2:12:20.240\n right?\n\n2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:22.560\n It's like the decentralized oracle network\n\n2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:25.040\n and the conditions that that decentralized oracle network\n\n2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:28.560\n needs to meet is gonna vary very widely\n\n2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:32.280\n from an insurance contract to a lending contract\n\n2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:36.680\n to an ad network contract to the data sales contract\n\n2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:40.680\n that we discussed to any number of other smart contracts.\n\n2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:44.600\n So really the ability of a decentralized oracle network\n\n2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:47.800\n to flexibly address all of those requirements\n\n2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:48.960\n is what's necessary.\n\n2:12:49.840 --> 2:12:51.480\n So flexibility is the goal,\n\n2:12:51.480 --> 2:12:55.280\n whereas with on chain like Bitcoin,\n\n2:12:55.280 --> 2:12:58.280\n flexibility is the enemy in the sense\n\n2:12:58.280 --> 2:13:03.280\n that you want security, you want the focus there.\n\n2:13:03.360 --> 2:13:05.480\n And in that kind of world,\n\n2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:08.040\n design decisions have huge consequences.\n\n2:13:08.040 --> 2:13:11.040\n And then if you look at the distributed oracle network side,\n\n2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:16.200\n you want to remove the restrictions of design choices.\n\n2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:19.000\n You want to provide maximal flexibility then.\n\n2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:23.720\n So it's a completely separate kind of a design framework.\n\n2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:25.160\n It's a slightly different problem, right?\n\n2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:28.200\n Because we're not trying to define transaction types\n\n2:13:28.200 --> 2:13:30.440\n fitting into blocks on a certain timeline\n\n2:13:30.440 --> 2:13:32.120\n of those blocks being generated.\n\n2:13:32.120 --> 2:13:35.120\n We're trying to say, hey, there's this world of services\n\n2:13:35.120 --> 2:13:37.640\n or this world of data that's not very deterministic,\n\n2:13:37.640 --> 2:13:39.200\n but it's unbelievably useful\n\n2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:40.800\n to these smart contracts over here.\n\n2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:42.920\n And actually they need it to even exist.\n\n2:13:42.920 --> 2:13:45.440\n And we really want them to exist because once they exist,\n\n2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:46.640\n it's gonna completely redefine\n\n2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:48.640\n what our whole industry is known for, right?\n\n2:13:48.640 --> 2:13:51.520\n And defined NFTs are not even the tip of the iceberg.\n\n2:13:51.520 --> 2:13:54.320\n They're like the snow coming off the top of the iceberg.\n\n2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:57.320\n And so our goal is to create a framework\n\n2:13:57.320 --> 2:14:00.000\n and an infrastructure and a software\n\n2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.240\n that allows people to compose\n\n2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:04.960\n decentralized oracle networks, right?\n\n2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:08.920\n So initially you can compose a decentralized oracle network\n\n2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:11.840\n of seven nodes that goes to three data sources\n\n2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:14.200\n to trigger your contract worth a million dollars.\n\n2:14:14.200 --> 2:14:15.400\n And that's where you could start.\n\n2:14:15.400 --> 2:14:16.840\n And then let's say your smart contract,\n\n2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:19.400\n your DeFi smart contract goes to a billion dollars.\n\n2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:21.440\n Well, then you need to make some changes, right?\n\n2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:23.000\n You need to go from seven nodes\n\n2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:25.680\n to 15 or maybe 31 nodes.\n\n2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:27.680\n And you need to go from three data sources\n\n2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:29.040\n to five or seven.\n\n2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.040\n And you maybe need to create some kind of\n\n2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:36.000\n what we call circuit breakers and some other checks.\n\n2:14:36.000 --> 2:14:36.920\n And you need to make sure\n\n2:14:36.920 --> 2:14:38.960\n that the decentralized oracle network\n\n2:14:38.960 --> 2:14:40.560\n comes to consensus around those checks.\n\n2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:42.600\n Because now the centralized oracle network\n\n2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:43.760\n isn't controlling a million dollars,\n\n2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.240\n it's controlling a billion dollars.\n\n2:14:45.240 --> 2:14:47.000\n And we have decentralized oracle networks\n\n2:14:47.000 --> 2:14:48.640\n that control well over a billion dollars,\n\n2:14:48.640 --> 2:14:50.320\n multiple billions of dollars.\n\n2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:52.240\n And we see them growing and getting more advanced\n\n2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:55.000\n data sources and more advanced features.\n\n2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:56.760\n And then if somebody else comes and says,\n\n2:14:56.760 --> 2:14:59.000\n well, I don't really wanna make a DeFi product,\n\n2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:00.520\n I wanna make crop insurance.\n\n2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:02.600\n And I have a completely different set of conditions.\n\n2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.360\n I want this method of consensus\n\n2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:06.840\n and I want data to be aggregated in this way,\n\n2:15:06.840 --> 2:15:07.840\n but not the way that you do\n\n2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:09.920\n for decentralized financial products.\n\n2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:10.960\n I mean, what are we supposed to tell them?\n\n2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:12.960\n We're supposed to tell them, no,\n\n2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:15.600\n our decentralized oracle network can't let you do that.\n\n2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:18.680\n And you can go and wait another five years\n\n2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:21.520\n until somebody builds it for you.\n\n2:15:21.520 --> 2:15:23.200\n That's not what we wanna do, right?\n\n2:15:23.200 --> 2:15:24.880\n What we wanna do is be able to say,\n\n2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:29.040\n absolutely, here's an example of how somebody else\n\n2:15:29.040 --> 2:15:33.040\n made a decentralized oracle network for weather insurance.\n\n2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:37.440\n Here's a template, change that template,\n\n2:15:37.440 --> 2:15:39.880\n evolve it to meet your needs.\n\n2:15:39.880 --> 2:15:41.240\n And then someone else comes and says,\n\n2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:44.760\n hey, I have some other use case in gaming, right?\n\n2:15:44.760 --> 2:15:48.120\n I wanna make NFTs related to real world sports events,\n\n2:15:48.120 --> 2:15:49.400\n or I wanna do whatever I wanna do\n\n2:15:49.400 --> 2:15:52.480\n with some kind of sports related data.\n\n2:15:52.480 --> 2:15:54.600\n Wonderful, here's the framework,\n\n2:15:54.600 --> 2:15:56.640\n here are your risk dynamics,\n\n2:15:56.640 --> 2:15:58.920\n here's a collection of node operators,\n\n2:15:58.920 --> 2:16:02.320\n here's a set of preintegrated data sources,\n\n2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:05.320\n here's a reputation system to assess\n\n2:16:05.320 --> 2:16:08.320\n the quality of your ensemble of nodes,\n\n2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:09.800\n here's a way to scale that up\n\n2:16:09.800 --> 2:16:13.040\n as the value in your contract scales.\n\n2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.000\n Here's all the tools that you need to build this contract.\n\n2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.600\n And what we actually see now as there are multiple types\n\n2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:23.520\n of computations and data sources that are provided\n\n2:16:23.520 --> 2:16:25.920\n by different decentralized oracle networks,\n\n2:16:25.920 --> 2:16:27.920\n of which there are now hundreds,\n\n2:16:27.920 --> 2:16:31.680\n we now see that a single hybrid smart contract\n\n2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:34.480\n might use multiple decentralized oracle networks.\n\n2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:36.520\n So there might be a hybrid smart contract\n\n2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:39.720\n that uses a price data, decentralized oracle network,\n\n2:16:39.720 --> 2:16:41.720\n a proof of reserve oracle network,\n\n2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:43.920\n a randomness oracle network.\n\n2:16:43.920 --> 2:16:45.920\n And I think we're gonna continue to see\n\n2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:49.640\n this dynamic that more and more advanced contracts\n\n2:16:49.640 --> 2:16:53.440\n compose various decentralized oracle networks\n\n2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:55.760\n into more advanced use cases.\n\n2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:00.760\n And this is the dynamic that we're focused on enabling.\n\n2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:03.400\n And I think it's actually a very virtuous cycle\n\n2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:05.760\n for everybody because the more of these\n\n2:17:05.760 --> 2:17:08.720\n hybrid smart contracts we enable on Ethereum\n\n2:17:08.720 --> 2:17:11.800\n and other blockchains, the more our industry\n\n2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:15.520\n provides real world outcomes to the market.\n\n2:17:15.520 --> 2:17:18.280\n To the larger world, which is at the end of the day,\n\n2:17:18.280 --> 2:17:21.040\n what I think everybody in our industry wants.\n\n2:17:21.040 --> 2:17:24.640\n Everybody in our industry wants hybrid smart contracts\n\n2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:28.080\n to become the way that global finance works,\n\n2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:31.200\n global trade works, global insurance products work,\n\n2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:34.240\n because they will inherently need both a blockchain\n\n2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:36.880\n on which the contract itself lives\n\n2:17:36.880 --> 2:17:39.200\n and an oracle network that powers\n\n2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:41.800\n all of the other interactions, right?\n\n2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:44.400\n As a developer, how would you recommend\n\n2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:48.400\n somebody listening to this, but also me,\n\n2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:52.880\n to get started with smart contracts\n\n2:17:52.880 --> 2:17:56.040\n and to get started with hybrid smart contracts?\n\n2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:59.080\n Well, for hybrid smart contracts,\n\n2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:01.680\n I'm gonna have to do some kind of shameless promotion.\n\n2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:04.320\n Please, let me twist your arm.\n\n2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:06.640\n Thank you.\n\n2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:08.520\n I think you can go to our YouTube.\n\n2:18:08.520 --> 2:18:11.080\n We have a number of developer tutorials.\n\n2:18:11.080 --> 2:18:12.160\n Chainlink YouTube?\n\n2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:13.360\n Yeah, Chainlink.\n\n2:18:13.360 --> 2:18:14.880\n I think if you just search Chainlink on YouTube,\n\n2:18:14.880 --> 2:18:16.120\n you should find it.\n\n2:18:17.560 --> 2:18:19.800\n Beyond that, we recently had a hackathon\n\n2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:22.440\n where we had a huge amount of very kind of\n\n2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:25.000\n advanced hybrid smart contracts getting built.\n\n2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.280\n To elaborate on that, you had a hackathon.\n\n2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:30.560\n Is that something that people can follow along\n\n2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:35.560\n like a video or there's web page traces of what happened?\n\n2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:37.640\n Or is there a future actual hackathons\n\n2:18:37.640 --> 2:18:39.560\n that people could literally participate in?\n\n2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:41.520\n There's plenty of more hackathons coming up.\n\n2:18:41.520 --> 2:18:44.440\n We wanna enable as many developers in web3 and web2\n\n2:18:44.440 --> 2:18:46.080\n to build hybrid smart contracts\n\n2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:47.880\n as a way to redefine our industry\n\n2:18:47.880 --> 2:18:52.280\n and kind of make all of these smart contracts come to life.\n\n2:18:52.280 --> 2:18:54.040\n There are definitely gonna be more hackathons.\n\n2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:56.720\n So people should go and preregister or register\n\n2:18:56.720 --> 2:18:58.240\n on a list to get involved in that.\n\n2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:00.240\n That's a great resource where we have a lot of speakers\n\n2:19:00.240 --> 2:19:01.440\n and a lot of educational tools.\n\n2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:04.680\n They happen over a course of weeks, not days.\n\n2:19:04.680 --> 2:19:07.080\n So there's a long time for people to work on these things\n\n2:19:07.080 --> 2:19:09.800\n at the speed that they find comfortable.\n\n2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:10.640\n Two questions.\n\n2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.400\n One, is there a kind of hello world entry point\n\n2:19:14.400 --> 2:19:17.640\n for hybrid smart contracts?\n\n2:19:17.640 --> 2:19:19.640\n And two, on the hackathon side,\n\n2:19:19.640 --> 2:19:22.360\n what kind of stuff do you see people building at first?\n\n2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:24.480\n Just kind of getting their feet wet\n\n2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:28.880\n in terms of the kind of applications that could be enabled.\n\n2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:30.480\n I mean, there's unbelievable things\n\n2:19:30.480 --> 2:19:32.440\n that we see people building.\n\n2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:35.160\n I think how to get your feet wet,\n\n2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:37.160\n I think the hello world is probably DeFi\n\n2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:38.520\n because it's pretty straightforward.\n\n2:19:38.520 --> 2:19:40.280\n And there's a large amount of data sources\n\n2:19:40.280 --> 2:19:42.800\n that we already have putting data on chain on test net,\n\n2:19:42.800 --> 2:19:45.360\n which is the test environment in which people would build.\n\n2:19:45.360 --> 2:19:47.800\n So I think DeFi is probably to a certain degree\n\n2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:49.240\n the most exciting for certain people\n\n2:19:49.240 --> 2:19:54.160\n and pretty expansive in terms of the tutorials\n\n2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.360\n and the amount of contracts\n\n2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:57.760\n to see how people have already built it.\n\n2:19:57.760 --> 2:19:58.600\n I think beyond that,\n\n2:19:58.600 --> 2:20:01.040\n we see people building amazing things at these hackathons.\n\n2:20:01.040 --> 2:20:02.400\n In the previous hackathon,\n\n2:20:02.400 --> 2:20:04.720\n we saw somebody build a smart contract\n\n2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:09.440\n that allows someone to rent out their Tesla.\n\n2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:14.440\n So it allows the Tesla API to give someone else access\n\n2:20:14.680 --> 2:20:16.600\n and rent out someone's Tesla\n\n2:20:16.600 --> 2:20:19.880\n on the basis of a smart contract kind of coordinating payment,\n\n2:20:19.880 --> 2:20:22.480\n which was kind of amazing.\n\n2:20:22.480 --> 2:20:23.880\n The more recent hackathon,\n\n2:20:23.880 --> 2:20:25.600\n we saw something called Dbridge,\n\n2:20:25.600 --> 2:20:28.400\n which is a cross chain solution that uses Oracle networks\n\n2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:30.640\n to confirm data on different chains.\n\n2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:33.880\n So I think the things that people build\n\n2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:36.840\n will just become expansive and varied\n\n2:20:36.840 --> 2:20:40.120\n in ways that I can't even imagine.\n\n2:20:40.120 --> 2:20:44.440\n But I think this recent hackathon saw a huge, huge list\n\n2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:48.080\n of different kind of winners in different categories.\n\n2:20:48.080 --> 2:20:49.360\n And there's so many different categories.\n\n2:20:49.360 --> 2:20:50.840\n We even have a GovTech category\n\n2:20:50.840 --> 2:20:53.120\n and a whole bunch of things.\n\n2:20:53.120 --> 2:20:54.640\n If people wanna see what's possible,\n\n2:20:54.640 --> 2:20:55.960\n they can go look at the winners.\n\n2:20:55.960 --> 2:20:57.960\n I think that's probably a good idea.\n\n2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:01.400\n Yeah, that'll be on the side of the hackathon.\n\n2:21:01.400 --> 2:21:03.880\n There's a blog related to that,\n\n2:21:03.880 --> 2:21:05.400\n and we're gonna have more of these.\n\n2:21:05.400 --> 2:21:08.440\n And once again, our explicit goal\n\n2:21:08.440 --> 2:21:11.560\n is to take our industry into this world\n\n2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:14.800\n of hybrid smart contracts, which just benefits everybody.\n\n2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:16.920\n It makes more on chain activity.\n\n2:21:16.920 --> 2:21:21.080\n It helps provide real world value to the average person\n\n2:21:21.080 --> 2:21:23.560\n from all of this infrastructure period.\n\n2:21:23.560 --> 2:21:25.040\n And at the end of the day,\n\n2:21:25.040 --> 2:21:28.560\n I think that it just redefines what our industry is about\n\n2:21:28.560 --> 2:21:29.560\n through use cases, right?\n\n2:21:29.560 --> 2:21:33.080\n Because if you only learn through our industry\n\n2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:35.040\n from the point of view of a single use case,\n\n2:21:35.040 --> 2:21:37.640\n like the NFT use case or some other use case,\n\n2:21:37.640 --> 2:21:39.680\n that's what our industry is about.\n\n2:21:39.680 --> 2:21:41.600\n And the more of these use cases\n\n2:21:41.600 --> 2:21:44.280\n that people can make available to the average person\n\n2:21:44.280 --> 2:21:46.680\n or to the FinTech world or to the insurance world\n\n2:21:46.680 --> 2:21:50.720\n or wherever, the faster our industry will not just be\n\n2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:52.600\n about Bitcoins or tokens,\n\n2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:55.160\n it will be about changing global finance,\n\n2:21:55.160 --> 2:21:58.080\n changing global insurance, changing global trade.\n\n2:21:58.080 --> 2:22:00.360\n And that's the change in the world\n\n2:22:00.360 --> 2:22:02.640\n that I and a lot of other people in this industry,\n\n2:22:02.640 --> 2:22:04.680\n I think, got into this for.\n\n2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:06.920\n Now it's funny, you've mentioned about,\n\n2:22:06.920 --> 2:22:09.440\n you've had a lot of kind words to say about Bitcoin\n\n2:22:09.440 --> 2:22:12.400\n and Ethereum as important technology\n\n2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:14.440\n that paved the way for the future.\n\n2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:16.920\n And you somehow did not mention\n\n2:22:16.920 --> 2:22:18.760\n one of the most profound pieces of technology,\n\n2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:20.400\n which is Dogecoin.\n\n2:22:20.400 --> 2:22:22.880\n What are your thoughts about this particular\n\n2:22:24.800 --> 2:22:26.280\n revolutionary technology?\n\n2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:28.000\n And what are your thoughts about Dogecoin\n\n2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.120\n going to the moon, to Mars,\n\n2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:32.520\n and outside of the solar system?\n\n2:22:32.520 --> 2:22:36.600\n I think Dogecoin is a very interesting kind of,\n\n2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:40.040\n probably closer to a social experiment than anything else.\n\n2:22:40.040 --> 2:22:42.840\n Isn't everything a social experiment?\n\n2:22:42.840 --> 2:22:45.160\n Yeah, I guess that's fair to a degree.\n\n2:22:46.360 --> 2:22:49.160\n I think it's fascinating how that's evolved.\n\n2:22:49.160 --> 2:22:51.320\n I think the people that made it\n\n2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:53.080\n with certain goals in mind\n\n2:22:53.080 --> 2:22:56.080\n and then it's kind of taken on a life of its own.\n\n2:22:56.080 --> 2:22:59.000\n I don't fully understand exactly why it's taken on a life\n\n2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:01.040\n of its own at this point.\n\n2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:03.040\n I once again, I don't spend too much time\n\n2:23:03.040 --> 2:23:07.080\n thinking about different tokens and how they're evolving.\n\n2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:10.720\n I'm much more focused on the launching and...\n\n2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:15.040\n The technology around trust and all those kinds of ideas.\n\n2:23:15.040 --> 2:23:18.840\n But I think one of the fascinating things about Dogecoin\n\n2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:23.840\n is how technology that leverages social dynamics,\n\n2:23:23.840 --> 2:23:28.840\n that technology's ability to utilize fun and memes to spread.\n\n2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:31.800\n I think it's really interesting.\n\n2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:35.280\n I don't think it should be discounted as a...\n\n2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:36.960\n I think I tweeted today something\n\n2:23:36.960 --> 2:23:40.480\n about like the fundamental force field of fun.\n\n2:23:41.600 --> 2:23:45.080\n That fun has an effect on the space time.\n\n2:23:45.080 --> 2:23:50.080\n So general relativity describes how mass and energy\n\n2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:53.920\n can curve space time. And I was just giving an example\n\n2:23:53.920 --> 2:23:56.360\n that when life is fun, it seems short.\n\n2:23:56.360 --> 2:23:58.560\n When life is not fun, it seems very long.\n\n2:23:58.560 --> 2:24:01.080\n So fun has a very similar effect on space time,\n\n2:24:01.080 --> 2:24:02.720\n like in curved space time.\n\n2:24:02.720 --> 2:24:07.200\n In that same sense, there is a power to the meme.\n\n2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:09.480\n And I think Dogecoin illustrates that.\n\n2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:12.680\n I think Elon is an example of somebody that uses Dogecoin.\n\n2:24:12.680 --> 2:24:16.600\n I don't know his philosophy in particular on this aspect,\n\n2:24:16.600 --> 2:24:18.240\n but he does use Dogecoin.\n\n2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:23.240\n But he does use it effectively to excite the world\n\n2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:26.400\n in a fun way about the possibilities\n\n2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:29.080\n of future technologies like cryptocurrency.\n\n2:24:29.080 --> 2:24:32.120\n I think the Bitcoin world is very serious right now.\n\n2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:36.760\n We've spoken about Bitcoin maximalists.\n\n2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:40.800\n There is very little space for fun and joking\n\n2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:45.800\n in the Bitcoin world, but there's still a little bit of fun\n\n2:24:45.800 --> 2:24:48.600\n and humor left in the Dogecoin world.\n\n2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:51.640\n In that sense, I think it's exceptionally powerful\n\n2:24:51.640 --> 2:24:56.640\n to inspire, to excite, to be able to talk about stuff\n\n2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:02.320\n without the seriousness of financial impact\n\n2:25:05.080 --> 2:25:08.880\n that now certain cryptocurrencies have like Bitcoin.\n\n2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:12.520\n So I keep an eye on, I've previously mentioned\n\n2:25:12.520 --> 2:25:16.120\n that Dogecoin I think is a fascinating piece of technology\n\n2:25:16.120 --> 2:25:19.120\n because I do think cryptocurrency is much bigger\n\n2:25:19.120 --> 2:25:23.880\n than the technology that you focus on.\n\n2:25:23.880 --> 2:25:27.760\n There is also a social element that you also spoke to\n\n2:25:27.760 --> 2:25:31.120\n that's I think not quite yet understood\n\n2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:35.440\n and it's fascinating to watch, especially as it covalls\n\n2:25:35.440 --> 2:25:37.360\n with the different tools on the internet,\n\n2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:39.640\n the different social networks,\n\n2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:42.160\n social network mechanisms on the internet.\n\n2:25:42.160 --> 2:25:46.200\n So I'm a huge supporter of Dogecoin\n\n2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:48.000\n because I'm a huge supporter of fun.\n\n2:25:49.880 --> 2:25:52.120\n I'm fascinated to see how it'll work out.\n\n2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:55.680\n You think it'll go to the moon?\n\n2:25:55.680 --> 2:25:57.600\n You think it'll be the first cryptocurrency\n\n2:25:57.600 --> 2:25:59.240\n to land on the moon?\n\n2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:00.080\n I couldn't say.\n\n2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:04.240\n I haven't done the analysis as I've said before.\n\n2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:05.640\n I haven't done the analysis.\n\n2:26:05.640 --> 2:26:09.640\n Well, yeah, no matter what,\n\n2:26:09.640 --> 2:26:12.520\n I do hope we will get humans back on the moon\n\n2:26:12.520 --> 2:26:15.320\n and hopefully get humans on Mars soon.\n\n2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:20.320\n Dogecoin, Bitcoin or not.\n\n2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:25.960\n Let me ask you about books and movies.\n\n2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:30.400\n What books and movies in your life long ago\n\n2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:35.400\n when you were a baby Sergei or today had an impact on you?\n\n2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:39.080\n Maybe you would recommend to others\n\n2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:43.640\n and maybe what ideas you took away from those books,\n\n2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:48.280\n movies, coloring books, children's books, blogs, whatever.\n\n2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:50.480\n Yeah, yeah, sure.\n\n2:26:51.440 --> 2:26:54.000\n So I think one of the things that had a very big impact\n\n2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000\n on me were Plato's dialogues\n\n2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:58.240\n and particularly Protagoras and Gorgias\n\n2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:01.520\n as some of the two initial ones.\n\n2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:05.600\n I think what Plato's dialogues do very well\n\n2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:09.520\n is they give people a clear picture of what dialogue looks\n\n2:27:09.520 --> 2:27:11.440\n like and what the assessment\n\n2:27:11.440 --> 2:27:15.240\n of information probably should look like, right?\n\n2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:18.480\n And how the dissection and analysis\n\n2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:20.480\n of an idea is very important\n\n2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:22.840\n and how it can actually be taken in either direction.\n\n2:27:22.840 --> 2:27:25.840\n But at the end of the day that the process\n\n2:27:25.840 --> 2:27:30.000\n of eliminating kind of this fuzzy thinking\n\n2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:33.360\n and arriving at whether it's an external dialogue\n\n2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:36.520\n or an internal dialogue about an accurate picture\n\n2:27:36.520 --> 2:27:38.960\n of reality is actually very important.\n\n2:27:38.960 --> 2:27:42.480\n And so I think I'm very lucky to have read the dialogues\n\n2:27:42.480 --> 2:27:44.920\n when I was in my early teenage years\n\n2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:46.480\n and it had a very large impact on me\n\n2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:49.520\n because it kind of showed me that nobody knows\n\n2:27:49.520 --> 2:27:51.000\n what they're talking about.\n\n2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:54.200\n I would play out dialogues in my mind\n\n2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:56.760\n and I would engage in certain dialogues\n\n2:27:56.760 --> 2:27:58.920\n with different people.\n\n2:27:58.920 --> 2:28:02.360\n And what the Platonic dialogue showed me was kind\n\n2:28:02.360 --> 2:28:06.000\n of how to tell when someone has no clue.\n\n2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:07.360\n And a lot of people are very good\n\n2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:12.360\n at kind of say they have a clue, right?\n\n2:28:12.680 --> 2:28:14.280\n Saying like, here's how the world works.\n\n2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:15.520\n Here's what you should do with your life.\n\n2:28:15.520 --> 2:28:16.760\n Here's what you should do with your time.\n\n2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:18.000\n Here's what you should do with your money.\n\n2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:19.800\n Here's what you should do with your attention.\n\n2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:22.400\n Here's what you should do with all these things.\n\n2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:26.280\n And I think the ability to evaluate information\n\n2:28:26.280 --> 2:28:31.000\n generally is something that is surprisingly under taught.\n\n2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:33.840\n I don't actually understand why there isn't a course\n\n2:28:33.840 --> 2:28:35.880\n in like high schools or universities\n\n2:28:35.880 --> 2:28:39.320\n that's just like, here is how you evaluate information.\n\n2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.640\n Here's how you engage in external dialogue\n\n2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:43.640\n and internal dialogue to arrive\n\n2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:45.480\n at an accurate picture of reality\n\n2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:47.200\n rather than the picture of reality\n\n2:28:47.200 --> 2:28:48.600\n that other people want you to have\n\n2:28:48.600 --> 2:28:50.560\n for their benefit most often, right?\n\n2:28:50.560 --> 2:28:52.760\n And at the end of the day,\n\n2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:54.800\n I think that put me down a path\n\n2:28:54.800 --> 2:28:57.120\n to really try and understand.\n\n2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:00.280\n Beyond that, I think biographies\n\n2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:02.880\n have had a very large impact on me.\n\n2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:05.800\n Plutarchs, Greek and Roman lives.\n\n2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:07.080\n After I read Plato,\n\n2:29:07.080 --> 2:29:09.000\n I started reading a bunch of stuff, Greek stuff.\n\n2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:10.360\n I was just like, these Greek guys,\n\n2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:12.440\n they really know how it is.\n\n2:29:12.440 --> 2:29:15.360\n They did this 2000 years ago and they still got it right.\n\n2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:16.600\n There's something here.\n\n2:29:16.600 --> 2:29:19.640\n It's kind of this like a theory of time around them,\n\n2:29:19.640 --> 2:29:21.080\n the value of intellectual ideas, right?\n\n2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:24.800\n If an intellectual idea has survived the test of time,\n\n2:29:24.800 --> 2:29:27.160\n it's much more valuable than the intellectual idea\n\n2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:28.720\n that I just came up with 10 minutes ago,\n\n2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:31.320\n I haven't told anybody and hasn't gone up against\n\n2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:35.880\n all of the kind of rebuttals.\n\n2:29:35.880 --> 2:29:36.840\n So...\n\n2:29:36.840 --> 2:29:37.760\n So what's your favorite,\n\n2:29:37.760 --> 2:29:41.240\n what would you say would be a most impactful biography\n\n2:29:41.240 --> 2:29:43.280\n that you've come across?\n\n2:29:43.280 --> 2:29:45.640\n I don't think it was those Greek or Roman biographies\n\n2:29:45.640 --> 2:29:48.560\n because they were very far away.\n\n2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:53.560\n I think that probably one of the most impactful ones\n\n2:29:53.560 --> 2:29:58.400\n that I can remember recently is around Vanderbilt.\n\n2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:03.640\n And so Vanderbilt was this guy who basically,\n\n2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:05.160\n without that much of an education,\n\n2:30:05.160 --> 2:30:08.760\n he would invent or work with people\n\n2:30:08.760 --> 2:30:10.160\n to make these steamboats.\n\n2:30:10.160 --> 2:30:12.080\n And then he had a lot of acumen\n\n2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:15.480\n around creating certain monopolies,\n\n2:30:15.480 --> 2:30:20.480\n regardless of what was right or wasn't right.\n\n2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:22.080\n Right or wasn't right.\n\n2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:23.200\n And then fascinating enough,\n\n2:30:23.200 --> 2:30:25.480\n it all hinged on like a Supreme Court case\n\n2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:29.120\n that decided if monopolies were acceptable\n\n2:30:29.120 --> 2:30:31.920\n in the form of state created monopolies or not.\n\n2:30:32.880 --> 2:30:36.800\n And if it was deemed that state created monopolies\n\n2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:39.440\n were acceptable, he would have had a huge problem, this guy.\n\n2:30:39.440 --> 2:30:41.880\n But it was deemed that state created monopolies\n\n2:30:41.880 --> 2:30:46.040\n through these licenses for steamboat routes\n\n2:30:46.040 --> 2:30:47.880\n was not acceptable.\n\n2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:51.200\n And that did two interesting things that unseated\n\n2:30:51.200 --> 2:30:55.560\n some kind of old time landed gentry in the Americas\n\n2:30:55.560 --> 2:30:57.920\n in like the 1830s and 40s.\n\n2:30:57.920 --> 2:31:00.840\n And it basically made him right\n\n2:31:00.840 --> 2:31:03.160\n and he saw it before other people.\n\n2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:08.160\n So I think Vanderbilt was a very interesting personality,\n\n2:31:08.200 --> 2:31:11.520\n first of all, of all the biographies that I read\n\n2:31:11.520 --> 2:31:16.520\n is somebody who really took the situation in hand\n\n2:31:16.520 --> 2:31:20.120\n and kind of took action to achieve an outcome,\n\n2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:23.840\n which I think was an amazing result.\n\n2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:26.200\n The fascinating thing, by the way,\n\n2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:28.360\n is, or amazing way of looking at things.\n\n2:31:28.360 --> 2:31:29.440\n The fascinating thing, by the way,\n\n2:31:29.440 --> 2:31:32.200\n is that the ferries now in New York Harbor\n\n2:31:32.200 --> 2:31:36.000\n are all run as a public good.\n\n2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:37.680\n So the fascinating thing is that the guy,\n\n2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:40.680\n he focused on an industry and he worked on something\n\n2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:42.800\n that was so important that it ended up\n\n2:31:42.800 --> 2:31:44.920\n becoming a public good.\n\n2:31:44.920 --> 2:31:48.720\n And I think that that's an interesting conception\n\n2:31:48.720 --> 2:31:51.800\n of how to look at this industry.\n\n2:31:51.800 --> 2:31:54.400\n I think there's a lot of economics dynamics\n\n2:31:54.400 --> 2:31:55.680\n around this industry,\n\n2:31:55.680 --> 2:31:58.960\n but I think I might've said this somewhere else before,\n\n2:31:58.960 --> 2:32:02.360\n but really the success of someone in this industry\n\n2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:06.640\n is whether they're able to make a Linux or HTTP\n\n2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:11.640\n or an HTTPS like system that lives on for a very long time\n\n2:32:11.640 --> 2:32:14.400\n and is essentially a kind of public good.\n\n2:32:14.400 --> 2:32:16.840\n It's a success of an idea,\n\n2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:19.960\n even if that idea is originally sort of a capitalist idea\n\n2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:23.000\n above that's grounded in financial benefit.\n\n2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:26.000\n Success of it is if it becomes a public good.\n\n2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:27.640\n It is so universal.\n\n2:32:27.640 --> 2:32:30.880\n It is so fundamental to the quality of life\n\n2:32:30.880 --> 2:32:32.120\n that it's a public good.\n\n2:32:32.120 --> 2:32:34.880\n It is deemed to be so valuable\n\n2:32:34.880 --> 2:32:36.480\n that it should be a public good.\n\n2:32:37.480 --> 2:32:38.320\n Yeah, I think so.\n\n2:32:38.320 --> 2:32:39.640\n I think that's a pretty,\n\n2:32:39.640 --> 2:32:42.160\n a pretty good definition of success that you work\n\n2:32:42.160 --> 2:32:44.560\n on a body of work and that body of work\n\n2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:47.200\n isn't just some commercial enterprise.\n\n2:32:47.200 --> 2:32:51.480\n It's a body of work that whatever commercial aspects\n\n2:32:51.480 --> 2:32:54.560\n or economic incentive aspects it might have,\n\n2:32:54.560 --> 2:32:56.640\n it eventually is so important\n\n2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:00.560\n that it becomes critical to how society functions.\n\n2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:04.800\n I'm personally quite lucky and grateful to be,\n\n2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:07.400\n in my opinion, working on something like that\n\n2:33:07.400 --> 2:33:11.000\n with an amazing team and an amazing community\n\n2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:13.280\n that seems to really very much care\n\n2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:18.280\n about this hybrid smart contract transparent world\n\n2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:20.600\n that a lot of people on our industry,\n\n2:33:20.600 --> 2:33:23.520\n realistically, I think this is why a lot of them signed up.\n\n2:33:23.520 --> 2:33:25.360\n This is why I came into our industry.\n\n2:33:25.360 --> 2:33:27.920\n It wasn't because Bitcoin,\n\n2:33:27.920 --> 2:33:32.040\n it was because Bitcoin was a picture\n\n2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:34.960\n of how the world could work in so many other ways.\n\n2:33:34.960 --> 2:33:37.480\n And that picture of how the world could work\n\n2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:41.440\n in so many other ways attracted me a very long time ago.\n\n2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:47.360\n And I think that all of this stuff\n\n2:33:47.360 --> 2:33:49.320\n will eventually become a public good.\n\n2:33:49.320 --> 2:33:50.960\n I think it will become so critical\n\n2:33:50.960 --> 2:33:54.360\n to how societies function internally and internationally\n\n2:33:54.360 --> 2:33:56.360\n that just like there are systems,\n\n2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:59.360\n like the Federal Reserve, like global payment systems,\n\n2:33:59.360 --> 2:34:00.720\n like all these types of things,\n\n2:34:00.720 --> 2:34:03.240\n I think eventually all of this technology\n\n2:34:03.240 --> 2:34:08.240\n will be baked into these societally critical systems.\n\n2:34:08.440 --> 2:34:11.320\n And if I, in our community and the people I work with\n\n2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:13.680\n and the body of work that we're working on\n\n2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:17.080\n can make some kind of contribution to that shift\n\n2:34:18.200 --> 2:34:22.640\n towards a fairer, economically fair, transparent society,\n\n2:34:23.760 --> 2:34:27.040\n from my point of view, it's a very worthwhile body of work.\n\n2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:30.640\n In terms of the show, you also mentioned the show,\n\n2:34:30.640 --> 2:34:33.960\n one of the shows that I really seem to like more and more\n\n2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:37.640\n for some reason is Star Trek, not the old Star Trek.\n\n2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:39.040\n I don't really get the old Star Trek.\n\n2:34:39.040 --> 2:34:41.000\n The special effects aren't good enough.\n\n2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:44.640\n Star Trek, like The Next Generation and Voyager\n\n2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:47.760\n and Deep Space Nine and all those.\n\n2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:52.400\n I think whenever I happen to watch a Star Trek show again,\n\n2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:54.840\n I have a very simple conception in my mind\n\n2:34:54.840 --> 2:34:57.800\n that I really didn't have whenever I saw it way back when.\n\n2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:00.080\n It's that I'm not a fan of Star Trek.\n\n2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:03.240\n It's that this is what the world looks like\n\n2:35:03.240 --> 2:35:06.880\n if technology takes us towards a utopia, right?\n\n2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:08.840\n So I think there's this fascinating thing\n\n2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:11.720\n where technology can take us towards a utopia\n\n2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:13.680\n or towards a dystopia.\n\n2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:18.000\n And in my mind, those kind of three Star Trek shows\n\n2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:23.000\n are a picture of what human civilization looks like\n\n2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:26.120\n if everybody's technological ambitions\n\n2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:28.440\n successfully take us towards a utopia, right?\n\n2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:30.840\n Because in the Star Trek universe,\n\n2:35:30.840 --> 2:35:34.120\n you're not seeking money or you're not seeking safety\n\n2:35:34.120 --> 2:35:38.440\n or you're not really seeking anything for yourself.\n\n2:35:38.440 --> 2:35:41.960\n Everybody within Maslow's hierarchy of needs\n\n2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:43.960\n has gotten so many things for themselves\n\n2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:48.960\n that their goal is learning and discovering and or helping.\n\n2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:53.160\n And I think there is this conception of human life\n\n2:35:53.160 --> 2:35:56.120\n once the baser needs are satisfied.\n\n2:35:56.120 --> 2:35:59.040\n And at the end of the day,\n\n2:35:59.040 --> 2:36:02.560\n I think that's what technology generally can elevate\n\n2:36:02.560 --> 2:36:04.360\n all of human civilization to, right?\n\n2:36:04.360 --> 2:36:07.280\n It can elevate us to Star Trek world\n\n2:36:07.280 --> 2:36:10.360\n where if people want to invent,\n\n2:36:10.360 --> 2:36:11.960\n they can do that all day and nothing else.\n\n2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.840\n If people wanna explore the stars,\n\n2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:14.840\n they can explore the stars\n\n2:36:14.840 --> 2:36:18.600\n and they don't have to worry about economic scarcity\n\n2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:21.040\n or any number of these other conceptions.\n\n2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:24.640\n So I don't know what the most impactful on me shows have been\n\n2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:27.600\n but for some reason recently Star Trek\n\n2:36:27.600 --> 2:36:29.880\n in the newer variant,\n\n2:36:29.880 --> 2:36:32.000\n not the most new Star Trek shows.\n\n2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:33.320\n Those shows are a little strange.\n\n2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:35.840\n The kind of middle Star Trek universe\n\n2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:37.840\n where everybody is doing something\n\n2:36:37.840 --> 2:36:40.400\n with like a very important purpose\n\n2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:42.080\n and nobody's thinking about like,\n\n2:36:42.080 --> 2:36:46.200\n where's my paycheck or where's my whatever.\n\n2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:47.040\n They're all kind of like,\n\n2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:50.560\n we have to discover the formula to this\n\n2:36:50.560 --> 2:36:52.440\n to save the planet over there.\n\n2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:54.360\n And literally every episode you're discovering a formula\n\n2:36:54.360 --> 2:36:55.240\n to save a planet, right?\n\n2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:58.480\n Of some kind or a universe or ecosystem or whatever.\n\n2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:00.360\n And you're looking at it, you're like,\n\n2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:02.160\n you know, this is like,\n\n2:37:02.160 --> 2:37:03.560\n this is a pretty good place to end up.\n\n2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:05.280\n This is where we might wanna end up.\n\n2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:06.400\n So it gives you hope.\n\n2:37:06.400 --> 2:37:11.400\n I mean, it's funny that we don't often think about the,\n\n2:37:13.200 --> 2:37:16.880\n I think it's very useful to think about positive visions\n\n2:37:16.880 --> 2:37:20.960\n of the future when we're trying to design technology.\n\n2:37:20.960 --> 2:37:25.080\n There's a lot of sort of in public discourse,\n\n2:37:25.080 --> 2:37:27.040\n a lot of people are thinking about\n\n2:37:27.040 --> 2:37:29.400\n kind of how everything goes wrong.\n\n2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:31.520\n It's important to think about that sometimes,\n\n2:37:31.520 --> 2:37:33.040\n but in moderation, I think,\n\n2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:37.080\n because there's not enough in my little corner\n\n2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:39.000\n of artificial intelligence world,\n\n2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:42.800\n people are very kind of fear monger centered.\n\n2:37:42.800 --> 2:37:44.240\n There's a lot of discussions\n\n2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:46.040\n about how everything goes wrong.\n\n2:37:46.040 --> 2:37:48.920\n Important to do, but it's also really important\n\n2:37:48.920 --> 2:37:53.240\n to talk about how things can go right,\n\n2:37:53.240 --> 2:37:56.000\n because we ultimately want to guide the design\n\n2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:58.880\n of the systems we create to make things right.\n\n2:37:58.880 --> 2:38:02.080\n And I think with hope and optimism,\n\n2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:05.840\n not naiveness, but optimism,\n\n2:38:05.840 --> 2:38:08.240\n you can actually create a better world.\n\n2:38:08.240 --> 2:38:10.600\n Like you have to think about a positive,\n\n2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:14.080\n a better world as you create,\n\n2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:16.080\n because then you can actually create it.\n\n2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:19.920\n Yeah, I'm one of the people that thinks\n\n2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:24.800\n that having an optimistic view of the world\n\n2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:26.840\n is better for design and creativity\n\n2:38:26.840 --> 2:38:28.840\n than having a pessimistic one.\n\n2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:30.920\n It's hard to design when you're in fear.\n\n2:38:33.360 --> 2:38:37.040\n Do you have advice for young people,\n\n2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:38.960\n speaking of being excited about\n\n2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:40.880\n and hopeful about the future world,\n\n2:38:40.880 --> 2:38:43.880\n do you have advice for young people today\n\n2:38:43.880 --> 2:38:46.760\n in computer science world,\n\n2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:48.920\n in software engineering world, in crypto world,\n\n2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:53.680\n but maybe in any world whatsoever for life,\n\n2:38:53.680 --> 2:38:57.040\n how to pick a career or how to live life in general?\n\n2:38:58.080 --> 2:39:02.280\n I think the thing that young people should do\n\n2:39:02.280 --> 2:39:04.160\n is not any one specific thing\n\n2:39:04.160 --> 2:39:07.440\n for any one specific young person.\n\n2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:11.920\n I think what they should do is what they won't be able to do\n\n2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.520\n in the later stages of their life.\n\n2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:16.160\n And the way, in my opinion,\n\n2:39:16.160 --> 2:39:19.520\n from a framework point of view to think about that\n\n2:39:19.520 --> 2:39:23.320\n is that the amount of obligations\n\n2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:27.680\n and the amount of time that a person has\n\n2:39:27.680 --> 2:39:30.520\n seems to just diminish over time, right?\n\n2:39:30.520 --> 2:39:32.480\n So the amount of free time they have, right?\n\n2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:33.600\n So you start your job,\n\n2:39:33.600 --> 2:39:35.600\n you get a bunch of responsibilities,\n\n2:39:35.600 --> 2:39:37.240\n something with your partner or spouse,\n\n2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:38.560\n more responsibilities,\n\n2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:40.720\n kids, probably even more responsibilities,\n\n2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:45.640\n and soon enough, the time that you have to educate yourself,\n\n2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:50.080\n to travel, to experience the world however,\n\n2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:53.320\n create whatever creative endeavor you're interested in,\n\n2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:55.800\n slowly but surely disappears.\n\n2:39:55.800 --> 2:39:57.840\n I think this is something\n\n2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:01.280\n that young people don't fully realize.\n\n2:40:01.280 --> 2:40:04.240\n They assume that the world as it is now\n\n2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:08.520\n and the amount of free time that they have to travel,\n\n2:40:08.520 --> 2:40:11.320\n to educate themselves, to make new friends,\n\n2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:12.600\n to do all these things,\n\n2:40:12.600 --> 2:40:16.720\n will somehow maybe diminish by 10%.\n\n2:40:16.720 --> 2:40:20.760\n It won't diminish by 10%, it will diminish by 90%.\n\n2:40:20.760 --> 2:40:22.480\n And the 10% that you have,\n\n2:40:22.480 --> 2:40:27.040\n you'll be resting to get back to work and get things done.\n\n2:40:27.040 --> 2:40:30.160\n So what I think young people should do,\n\n2:40:30.160 --> 2:40:32.600\n and this is why it's very different for each of them, right?\n\n2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:33.720\n I can't tell young people,\n\n2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:36.440\n hey, you should study philosophy, travel,\n\n2:40:36.440 --> 2:40:38.800\n and start your own enterprise to achieve something\n\n2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:39.760\n worthwhile in the world, right?\n\n2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:41.640\n That might be something that's good for me\n\n2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:45.440\n with my values and my kind of worldview,\n\n2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:47.840\n but for other people might be something else.\n\n2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:51.160\n I think the way that they should conceptualize it\n\n2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:56.160\n is imagine if over the next 10, 12 years,\n\n2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:02.200\n the amount of choice that you had about what you could do\n\n2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:05.320\n was cut down by 90%.\n\n2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:07.920\n What would you, and this is copying from this kind of\n\n2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:11.560\n Jeff Bezos regret minimization framework.\n\n2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:12.720\n In that framework, it's like,\n\n2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:16.040\n what would I regret not doing at 80?\n\n2:41:16.040 --> 2:41:19.400\n And that's kind of meant to create this longterm view\n\n2:41:19.400 --> 2:41:22.040\n and make these decisions now that'll get you\n\n2:41:22.040 --> 2:41:24.840\n to a longterm future that you can look back on\n\n2:41:24.840 --> 2:41:26.960\n and be proud of your life, right?\n\n2:41:26.960 --> 2:41:28.840\n What I think young people should do\n\n2:41:28.840 --> 2:41:30.600\n is they should say to themselves,\n\n2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:33.960\n look, if I never get the chance to travel\n\n2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:36.000\n for as long as I live,\n\n2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:40.440\n assuming that after 25, after 27, after 29,\n\n2:41:40.440 --> 2:41:43.400\n that's the case, how will I feel about that?\n\n2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:46.920\n If I never get to start a company after 25,\n\n2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:49.080\n after I get married, after I have kids,\n\n2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:50.960\n how will I feel about that?\n\n2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:53.280\n And whatever they feel the worst about\n\n2:41:53.280 --> 2:41:54.880\n is what they should do.\n\n2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:57.120\n Whatever they feel like when they say to themselves,\n\n2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:01.360\n you know, if I don't travel now, I will never travel.\n\n2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:02.880\n And they feel horrible about that.\n\n2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:05.960\n They just have an overwhelming fear\n\n2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:10.760\n and disgust at themselves in that type of state\n\n2:42:10.760 --> 2:42:14.600\n at 25, 27, 29, that's what they should do.\n\n2:42:14.600 --> 2:42:16.600\n And they shouldn't listen to anybody else.\n\n2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:20.920\n Let me put it to you this way.\n\n2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:24.560\n If you're really smart, you're gonna make it anyway.\n\n2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:26.360\n There's a lot of people putting a lot of pressure on you\n\n2:42:26.360 --> 2:42:28.560\n because they're afraid whether you're gonna make it.\n\n2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:31.280\n If you're really smart, you're gonna make it anyway.\n\n2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.600\n If you're not really smart, you're screwed anyway.\n\n2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:36.120\n So at the end of the day.\n\n2:42:36.120 --> 2:42:39.000\n Either way, just relax with it and use your time well\n\n2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:43.080\n to do the things you would most regret not doing.\n\n2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:44.720\n That's really fascinating.\n\n2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:46.120\n I wouldn't say relax.\n\n2:42:46.120 --> 2:42:50.360\n I would say very much cherish the free time,\n\n2:42:50.360 --> 2:42:52.640\n the discretionary time that you have\n\n2:42:52.640 --> 2:42:56.360\n from the age of 18 to maybe 25.\n\n2:42:56.360 --> 2:42:59.760\n Because at 25, everyone's gonna start looking at each other\n\n2:42:59.760 --> 2:43:02.040\n and asking, what have I achieved?\n\n2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:04.520\n Like my friends have achieved, I haven't achieved.\n\n2:43:04.520 --> 2:43:06.200\n And then by the time you get to 30,\n\n2:43:06.200 --> 2:43:07.960\n you're gonna look at each other again and go,\n\n2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:11.360\n well, my friends have a family or a company\n\n2:43:11.360 --> 2:43:14.480\n or a PhD or a whatever, what do I have?\n\n2:43:14.480 --> 2:43:16.040\n And the pressure will just increase.\n\n2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:20.040\n And it'll increase so much that even if you want to go\n\n2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:22.760\n and do the fun thing, it will not be fun.\n\n2:43:22.760 --> 2:43:26.080\n Because the pressure of comparing yourself\n\n2:43:26.080 --> 2:43:29.240\n to your friends at 25 or your peers at 30\n\n2:43:29.240 --> 2:43:33.560\n will be so great that it will no longer be normal\n\n2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:36.440\n for you to be in a hostel at 30,\n\n2:43:36.440 --> 2:43:38.280\n kind of like living it up.\n\n2:43:40.480 --> 2:43:42.400\n And this is why I also can't tell you\n\n2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:43.360\n specifically what it is.\n\n2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:46.000\n For me, it was getting an education in philosophy\n\n2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:47.760\n that was rigorous and in depth.\n\n2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:50.280\n It was traveling and it was starting an enterprise\n\n2:43:50.280 --> 2:43:52.640\n that I thought that was worthwhile, that I directed,\n\n2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:54.320\n that I could make into something great.\n\n2:43:54.320 --> 2:43:55.600\n That's what it was for me.\n\n2:43:55.600 --> 2:43:58.040\n For other people, it might be something with a band,\n\n2:43:58.040 --> 2:43:59.880\n it might be something with painting,\n\n2:43:59.880 --> 2:44:02.280\n it might be an education.\n\n2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:04.760\n You, by the way, also should not assume\n\n2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:09.760\n that your ability to get an education will improve.\n\n2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:13.200\n All of those responsibilities will take away\n\n2:44:13.200 --> 2:44:15.480\n your ability to get an education.\n\n2:44:15.480 --> 2:44:17.480\n So if you value having an education,\n\n2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:22.000\n if you value being a deeply educated, well rounded person\n\n2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:25.320\n with a wide array of knowledge on a wide array of topics,\n\n2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:27.920\n capitalism will force you to specialize.\n\n2:44:27.920 --> 2:44:29.720\n That's what it's good at, it's gonna take you,\n\n2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:32.920\n it's gonna fashion you into a very specific tool\n\n2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:36.880\n for a very, most people, into a very specific set of tasks.\n\n2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:40.600\n If you want to have an education in something, get it now.\n\n2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:43.120\n If you wanna travel somewhere, travel there now.\n\n2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:45.360\n If you wanna do some kind of creative endeavor\n\n2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:48.640\n that you doubt whether you'll have time for in the future,\n\n2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:49.480\n do it now.\n\n2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:51.320\n You won't have time for it in the future,\n\n2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:54.560\n you won't have time to read philosophy books all day,\n\n2:44:54.560 --> 2:44:59.560\n unfortunately, you won't have time to fly to Italy\n\n2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:02.080\n and kind of hang out with people.\n\n2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:04.040\n If you're serious about your life,\n\n2:45:04.040 --> 2:45:05.440\n you're gonna get more responsibilities,\n\n2:45:05.440 --> 2:45:07.360\n you're gonna get more stuff to do.\n\n2:45:07.360 --> 2:45:10.920\n And so my advice to you is do not piss away\n\n2:45:10.920 --> 2:45:14.480\n this rare, unique, discretionary time.\n\n2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:18.080\n And if your friends are, get new friends.\n\n2:45:18.080 --> 2:45:21.480\n Get smarter friends, get people who are using\n\n2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:23.160\n the limited time they have better.\n\n2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:25.920\n That's my advice.\n\n2:45:25.920 --> 2:45:29.240\n So it's just a quickly comment, it's brilliant.\n\n2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:31.480\n You know, to reframe high school\n\n2:45:31.480 --> 2:45:34.120\n and undergraduate college education,\n\n2:45:34.120 --> 2:45:37.400\n sometimes people wanna quickly get it over with.\n\n2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:42.400\n But one thing I remember thinking,\n\n2:45:42.640 --> 2:45:45.440\n and it's very true about high school,\n\n2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:48.120\n is one of the only times in your life\n\n2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:51.280\n you'll get a chance to truly get a broad education.\n\n2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:53.840\n You don't often think of it that way,\n\n2:45:53.840 --> 2:45:57.160\n but it's a chance to really enjoy learning things\n\n2:45:57.160 --> 2:45:58.720\n that are outside of the specialty\n\n2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:00.480\n that you'll eventually end up with.\n\n2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:02.280\n And that's how college education is.\n\n2:46:02.280 --> 2:46:05.640\n And on a more fun side, I played music,\n\n2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:09.360\n I did martial arts, and we offline mentioned\n\n2:46:09.360 --> 2:46:10.720\n played video games.\n\n2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:14.120\n I find it fascinating and brilliant what you said,\n\n2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:17.400\n which is the world will not give you a chance\n\n2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:19.760\n to truly enjoy many of these things\n\n2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:22.720\n and truly get value from many of those things\n\n2:46:23.600 --> 2:46:25.560\n once you get older.\n\n2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:29.440\n I find it exceptionally difficult to enjoy video games now.\n\n2:46:29.440 --> 2:46:30.280\n There's so much stuff to do,\n\n2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:31.800\n there's so much responsibility.\n\n2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:37.280\n And I, at the time when I played Elder Scrolls\n\n2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:39.920\n and Baldur's Gate and Diablo II,\n\n2:46:39.920 --> 2:46:44.440\n and at the time I thought maybe that was a waste of time.\n\n2:46:45.880 --> 2:46:49.080\n But now looking back, I realize,\n\n2:46:49.080 --> 2:46:50.520\n because I always thought,\n\n2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:52.120\n let me get the career first\n\n2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:54.080\n and then I'll have a chance to play video games.\n\n2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:55.880\n That's the way I was thinking.\n\n2:46:55.880 --> 2:46:57.080\n It was a waste of time\n\n2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:01.120\n because I should really progress on the career\n\n2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:03.160\n and then I'll have time to play video games.\n\n2:47:03.160 --> 2:47:06.160\n No, the reality is that was really fulfilling.\n\n2:47:06.160 --> 2:47:10.560\n Those are some of the happiest travel experiences\n\n2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:14.040\n of my life is me traveling to those virtual worlds\n\n2:47:14.040 --> 2:47:15.680\n and spending time in them.\n\n2:47:15.680 --> 2:47:16.880\n And it was really fulfilling\n\n2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:19.160\n and they stayed with me for the rest of my life.\n\n2:47:19.160 --> 2:47:21.880\n And I get to experience echoes of that\n\n2:47:21.880 --> 2:47:23.440\n when I play video games these days\n\n2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:25.280\n for an hour here, an hour there,\n\n2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:27.840\n like one hour a month or something like that.\n\n2:47:27.840 --> 2:47:30.960\n But even those experiences, as silly as they are,\n\n2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:33.440\n they seem like a waste of time at the time,\n\n2:47:33.440 --> 2:47:37.040\n enjoying them fully, unapologetically.\n\n2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:41.160\n And in a framework exactly as you said,\n\n2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:43.800\n would I regret being the kind of person\n\n2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:46.560\n who've never played those video games?\n\n2:47:46.560 --> 2:47:50.120\n And I can, for myself, honestly say that yes.\n\n2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:52.280\n Look, when I'm on my death bed,\n\n2:47:53.480 --> 2:47:57.400\n I'm glad I built Baldur's Gate 2\n\n2:47:57.400 --> 2:48:00.960\n and all those arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind\n\n2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:03.600\n and all the Elder Scrolls games.\n\n2:48:03.600 --> 2:48:08.600\n And yeah, the things that don't necessarily fit\n\n2:48:10.440 --> 2:48:12.280\n into this kind of storyline\n\n2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:14.480\n of what a career is supposed to be,\n\n2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:16.480\n travel and all those experiences that you mentioned.\n\n2:48:16.480 --> 2:48:20.000\n I think I'd just like to say one final quick thing on this.\n\n2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:24.000\n I think this extends to really hard things as well.\n\n2:48:24.000 --> 2:48:25.800\n It extends to the things you wanna do,\n\n2:48:25.800 --> 2:48:27.360\n but one of the best pieces of advice\n\n2:48:27.360 --> 2:48:31.720\n one of my mentors gave me early on in my career\n\n2:48:31.720 --> 2:48:35.400\n around this time is that it will actually become harder\n\n2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:38.760\n to start a company as you get older.\n\n2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:41.360\n Once again, because you have more responsibilities,\n\n2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:44.560\n you're responsible to your partner for some kind of income\n\n2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:45.720\n to create a life together.\n\n2:48:45.720 --> 2:48:47.160\n Once you have kids, you're responsible\n\n2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:50.320\n for an even greater income to create a life for kids.\n\n2:48:50.320 --> 2:48:53.280\n And startups do not generate income, right?\n\n2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:56.040\n They take many, many years before anything happens.\n\n2:48:56.040 --> 2:48:59.160\n People are getting evicted, people are eating ramen noodles.\n\n2:48:59.160 --> 2:49:02.160\n That is a thing, that happens, that will happen.\n\n2:49:02.160 --> 2:49:05.920\n So I'm not saying that you should do the fun things\n\n2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:07.360\n or the enjoyable things.\n\n2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:12.200\n I'm saying the things that you would regret not doing,\n\n2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:17.200\n that you can uniquely do in the time span from 18 to 25.\n\n2:49:18.080 --> 2:49:22.360\n Which one of which is, if you plan to have a family\n\n2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:24.680\n and start a family when you're 25,\n\n2:49:24.680 --> 2:49:26.840\n you should start a company now.\n\n2:49:26.840 --> 2:49:29.440\n You should not wait until a bunch of people depend on you\n\n2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:32.120\n for income to eat, to start a company.\n\n2:49:32.120 --> 2:49:34.720\n The amount of pressure that will be on you at that point\n\n2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:36.480\n will be monumental.\n\n2:49:36.480 --> 2:49:39.200\n You should start a company when nobody depends on you\n\n2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:42.680\n and you can sleep on the floor eating ramen noodles\n\n2:49:42.680 --> 2:49:45.040\n and still have a great time and show up\n\n2:49:45.040 --> 2:49:47.720\n with a lot of enthusiasm and be excited.\n\n2:49:47.720 --> 2:49:52.720\n So I just mean whatever you want to really devote yourself\n\n2:49:52.760 --> 2:49:56.200\n to and really do, don't put it off.\n\n2:49:56.200 --> 2:49:59.080\n Don't go to consulting or banking or any other industry\n\n2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:00.600\n and say, I'm gonna do this for three years\n\n2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:02.080\n and I'll get experience.\n\n2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:04.680\n The only way you get experience is by doing something.\n\n2:50:04.680 --> 2:50:07.440\n You go, you do it, you fail, you do it again and again\n\n2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:09.680\n and again and again and again and then you have experience\n\n2:50:09.680 --> 2:50:10.720\n and then you can do it right.\n\n2:50:10.720 --> 2:50:12.360\n That's the only way experience happens.\n\n2:50:12.360 --> 2:50:14.720\n There is no other way short of mentorship.\n\n2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:16.240\n If you're lucky to get mentorship,\n\n2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:18.760\n 99% of people don't get mentorship.\n\n2:50:18.760 --> 2:50:20.640\n And even though we're talking about young people,\n\n2:50:20.640 --> 2:50:23.720\n I feel like you're speaking to me as somebody who spent\n\n2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:25.720\n the last two weeks sleeping on the floor\n\n2:50:25.720 --> 2:50:28.400\n because there's no mattress and somebody who is single\n\n2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:30.840\n and somebody who's thinking about doing a startup,\n\n2:50:30.840 --> 2:50:34.760\n I felt like you're speaking to me as a fellow young person.\n\n2:50:34.760 --> 2:50:39.760\n Let me ask you about this whole life of ours\n\n2:50:41.040 --> 2:50:43.160\n to zoom out on the big philosophical question,\n\n2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:44.520\n the ridiculous question.\n\n2:50:44.520 --> 2:50:46.680\n What do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:49.320\n Do you think about this kind of stuff\n\n2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:51.920\n as you're creating all the technology,\n\n2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:54.520\n as you're thinking about this future?\n\n2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:57.160\n You ever zoom out and think like, why?\n\n2:50:57.160 --> 2:50:59.880\n Why are you surrogate striving?\n\n2:50:59.880 --> 2:51:04.880\n Why are we the human species striving for the stars?\n\n2:51:05.040 --> 2:51:08.880\n So I think it comes down to whether people\n\n2:51:08.880 --> 2:51:10.240\n wanna live in society.\n\n2:51:11.200 --> 2:51:14.960\n So if people decide to be part of society,\n\n2:51:14.960 --> 2:51:19.960\n they have a certain set of conditions\n\n2:51:20.040 --> 2:51:23.240\n that they decide to take part in, right?\n\n2:51:23.240 --> 2:51:27.640\n So I think what this comes down to is a lot of\n\n2:51:27.640 --> 2:51:30.280\n really involved conversations.\n\n2:51:30.280 --> 2:51:33.000\n But if we assume people have free will and choice,\n\n2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:36.120\n if we just kind of make that blanket assumption,\n\n2:51:36.120 --> 2:51:37.600\n then the question starts to become,\n\n2:51:37.600 --> 2:51:39.200\n well, what choices do we make?\n\n2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:41.880\n And how do we live with those choices?\n\n2:51:41.880 --> 2:51:44.640\n And I think probably the most fundamental choice\n\n2:51:44.640 --> 2:51:47.560\n is whether we exist in a society\n\n2:51:47.560 --> 2:51:49.840\n or we choose to leave society.\n\n2:51:49.840 --> 2:51:50.880\n And there are people that do this.\n\n2:51:50.880 --> 2:51:52.000\n There are people that go live in the woods.\n\n2:51:52.000 --> 2:51:55.080\n There are people that immigrate to other societies\n\n2:51:55.080 --> 2:51:56.880\n and they make a choice, right?\n\n2:51:56.880 --> 2:51:58.840\n And as they enter those other societies\n\n2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:01.840\n or they choose to leave society and go live in the woods,\n\n2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:05.960\n they adopt a certain set of values, right?\n\n2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:08.400\n They adopt values that the society prescribes,\n\n2:52:08.400 --> 2:52:09.680\n they compromise their own values,\n\n2:52:09.680 --> 2:52:11.000\n they define their own values,\n\n2:52:11.000 --> 2:52:13.760\n and they create a set of values for themselves, right?\n\n2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:18.080\n I think at the end of the day,\n\n2:52:18.080 --> 2:52:21.000\n if you're going to choose to live in society,\n\n2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:25.600\n in addition to all the minimums of not throwing garbage\n\n2:52:25.600 --> 2:52:28.920\n on the floor and doing nice things for people\n\n2:52:28.920 --> 2:52:31.520\n that need help and doing any number of things\n\n2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:34.640\n to just be a normal human being within society,\n\n2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:37.120\n you have to ask yourself,\n\n2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:39.880\n what am I doing as part of society, right?\n\n2:52:39.880 --> 2:52:42.640\n You can always say, hey, I'm going to leave society.\n\n2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:43.680\n I'm going to live in the woods.\n\n2:52:43.680 --> 2:52:44.720\n I did that, right?\n\n2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:46.960\n I went and I lived in the woods and I gave it a shot,\n\n2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:49.760\n realized a ton of stuff, huge amount of clarity from that.\n\n2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:52.760\n But when you decide to live in society,\n\n2:52:52.760 --> 2:52:57.480\n you take on, first of all, certain minimal agreements.\n\n2:52:57.480 --> 2:53:01.040\n You mold your values a little bit to that society.\n\n2:53:01.040 --> 2:53:03.960\n That's another choice that people inherently make.\n\n2:53:03.960 --> 2:53:07.120\n And then there's a question of,\n\n2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:08.920\n well, what am I doing here, right?\n\n2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:11.000\n What am I doing in society, right?\n\n2:53:11.000 --> 2:53:12.960\n So when people say the meaning of life,\n\n2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:14.440\n I don't know what the meaning of life is.\n\n2:53:14.440 --> 2:53:16.480\n It's the meaning of life in society.\n\n2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:18.400\n Right, what's the meaning of life for the choice\n\n2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:20.480\n that you've made within society, right?\n\n2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.640\n Because that's maybe the first fundamental choice\n\n2:53:22.640 --> 2:53:23.280\n you made.\n\n2:53:23.280 --> 2:53:24.560\n You made a choice and you continue\n\n2:53:24.560 --> 2:53:27.280\n to make a choice to be part of society\n\n2:53:27.280 --> 2:53:30.600\n and a specific society, right?\n\n2:53:30.600 --> 2:53:32.280\n So you've made this choice.\n\n2:53:32.280 --> 2:53:34.120\n You're part of a society.\n\n2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:41.880\n And now you kind of have a life and you have people around you.\n\n2:53:41.880 --> 2:53:44.640\n And then the question is, in my opinion,\n\n2:53:44.640 --> 2:53:46.800\n the question is, what is the body of work\n\n2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:50.120\n that you want to make, right?\n\n2:53:50.120 --> 2:53:55.040\n I think, personally, that life is kind of so short.\n\n2:53:55.040 --> 2:53:57.760\n And the ability to get enough resources for yourself\n\n2:53:57.760 --> 2:53:59.440\n in at least the developed markets\n\n2:53:59.440 --> 2:54:03.600\n where we're lucky to be in is so relatively abundant\n\n2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:08.200\n that we, you and me, have the luxury,\n\n2:54:08.200 --> 2:54:10.960\n by your pursuit of a PhD, you've had this luxury,\n\n2:54:10.960 --> 2:54:13.360\n I've had this luxury through the work\n\n2:54:13.360 --> 2:54:16.760\n that I've been doing, to pursue something\n\n2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:19.800\n that makes society better.\n\n2:54:19.800 --> 2:54:25.000\n So this is kind of the question, I would say.\n\n2:54:25.000 --> 2:54:28.280\n The question is, am I going to live in society, yes or no?\n\n2:54:28.280 --> 2:54:28.960\n Yes, OK.\n\n2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:30.120\n Most people choose yes.\n\n2:54:30.120 --> 2:54:31.600\n I understand why, to a degree.\n\n2:54:31.600 --> 2:54:33.400\n I understand why some people choose no.\n\n2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:35.440\n And then what is the but?\n\n2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:37.040\n And I'm going to be in society.\n\n2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:38.440\n If you choose to be in society, you're\n\n2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:40.200\n just choosing to abide by the rules.\n\n2:54:40.200 --> 2:54:42.600\n You're choosing to just do the minimum, right?\n\n2:54:42.600 --> 2:54:44.360\n That's what being part of society means.\n\n2:54:44.360 --> 2:54:45.840\n People that choose to be part of society\n\n2:54:45.840 --> 2:54:47.920\n but don't want to do this, it's very confusing.\n\n2:54:47.920 --> 2:54:48.840\n They should just leave.\n\n2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:51.200\n They should just go, look, I don't like this deal.\n\n2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:52.600\n I'm going to go somewhere else.\n\n2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:53.640\n I'm going to live in Tibet.\n\n2:54:53.640 --> 2:54:55.120\n I'm going to live in the woods.\n\n2:54:55.120 --> 2:55:00.000\n I'm going to live wherever the rules are to my liking, right?\n\n2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:02.240\n You've chosen to be in society.\n\n2:55:02.240 --> 2:55:04.120\n Next question, kind of final question,\n\n2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:07.280\n is what is the body of work that I'm going to be involved in?\n\n2:55:07.280 --> 2:55:10.200\n Because in looking at that Jeff Bezos kind of regret\n\n2:55:10.200 --> 2:55:12.400\n minimization framework thing, I think\n\n2:55:12.400 --> 2:55:14.280\n that's what a lot of it really comes down to,\n\n2:55:14.280 --> 2:55:16.800\n is you kind of, the framework is at 80 years old,\n\n2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:18.800\n you look back over your life, what would you\n\n2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:19.840\n regret not doing?\n\n2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:23.360\n What would you regret not pursuing?\n\n2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:26.000\n I think there are a number of things on a personal level\n\n2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:29.800\n each person has, but I think, at least for me,\n\n2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:32.720\n and probably for many of the other people I know,\n\n2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:35.800\n there's a question of what is the body of work\n\n2:55:35.800 --> 2:55:37.280\n that I was involved in?\n\n2:55:37.280 --> 2:55:38.680\n What did I do?\n\n2:55:38.680 --> 2:55:40.160\n What happened, right?\n\n2:55:40.160 --> 2:55:42.760\n What was I involved in?\n\n2:55:42.760 --> 2:55:47.840\n And in my opinion, you should have a good answer to that.\n\n2:55:47.840 --> 2:55:50.120\n You mentioned the body of work in relation\n\n2:55:50.120 --> 2:55:54.760\n to whether it helped make a better world.\n\n2:55:54.760 --> 2:55:58.280\n And the fundamental question there is,\n\n2:55:58.280 --> 2:56:00.120\n what does better mean?\n\n2:56:00.120 --> 2:56:03.920\n So it's our striving to understand what is better.\n\n2:56:03.920 --> 2:56:08.920\n What kind of world would we love to exist after we're gone?\n\n2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:12.040\n And I think that's another thing,\n\n2:56:12.040 --> 2:56:13.600\n almost unanswerable question,\n\n2:56:13.600 --> 2:56:16.440\n but it's one we can strive towards,\n\n2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:18.280\n is what is a better world?\n\n2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:22.560\n Right, I think that's once again,\n\n2:56:22.560 --> 2:56:23.800\n that's a very personal question.\n\n2:56:23.800 --> 2:56:26.240\n I'm not sure if there's an objective moral truth\n\n2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:28.440\n that's gonna suddenly give us all an answer.\n\n2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:30.520\n I think it's actually quite fascinating to me\n\n2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:32.600\n when people feel they have this objective moral truth,\n\n2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:34.600\n they're so sure in their opinions,\n\n2:56:34.600 --> 2:56:37.800\n this is what we do, we should go hurt them or help them\n\n2:56:37.800 --> 2:56:41.080\n or kill them or rescue them or whatever, right?\n\n2:56:41.080 --> 2:56:44.320\n There's all these kind of very situational specific\n\n2:56:44.320 --> 2:56:46.560\n kind of like, this is the right thing to do,\n\n2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:49.960\n the objective moral truth told me that this is it.\n\n2:56:49.960 --> 2:56:51.960\n But maybe there's a definitive truth\n\n2:56:51.960 --> 2:56:56.360\n that we can arrive towards sort of a consensus\n\n2:56:56.360 --> 2:56:59.640\n of what that is within the little local pocket\n\n2:56:59.640 --> 2:57:01.400\n of society that you're in.\n\n2:57:01.400 --> 2:57:02.240\n Yeah, that's the point.\n\n2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:03.080\n That's what happens.\n\n2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:04.360\n People just then mislabel it\n\n2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:06.520\n and they go like objective moral truth.\n\n2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:09.280\n This is not our idea.\n\n2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:10.760\n This is coming up from on high here.\n\n2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:15.240\n This is the objective moral truth that,\n\n2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:18.640\n I think exists in some metaphysical form somewhere.\n\n2:57:18.640 --> 2:57:21.160\n And then you build a building with marble and it's big\n\n2:57:21.160 --> 2:57:22.840\n and usually what happens.\n\n2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:23.920\n And then you convince yourself\n\n2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:24.760\n that that building represents.\n\n2:57:24.760 --> 2:57:26.440\n I think those people actually,\n\n2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:27.920\n the people who build those buildings\n\n2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:30.280\n probably understand that there is no metaphysical objective.\n\n2:57:30.280 --> 2:57:32.640\n They're just like, we're all just coming to consensus.\n\n2:57:32.640 --> 2:57:34.280\n I'm gonna build the biggest building and you're like me\n\n2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:35.800\n and that's what we're gonna do, right?\n\n2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:37.960\n They just look at it that way probably.\n\n2:57:37.960 --> 2:57:42.960\n I think what ends up happening with all these values is,\n\n2:57:43.240 --> 2:57:45.000\n yeah, people should determine that for themselves.\n\n2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:47.200\n I agree that there's a second order question here\n\n2:57:47.200 --> 2:57:50.200\n of what is the best body of work to work on.\n\n2:57:51.480 --> 2:57:53.480\n Personally, I think that's probably a mix\n\n2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:56.000\n of what could you realistically achieve?\n\n2:57:57.280 --> 2:57:59.040\n Is that gonna have an impact on society\n\n2:57:59.040 --> 2:58:00.160\n that you feel good about?\n\n2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:01.480\n Yeah. Right?\n\n2:58:01.480 --> 2:58:04.680\n So these are probably the two aspects of this question\n\n2:58:04.680 --> 2:58:07.080\n and is this gonna have a good impact on society\n\n2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:08.120\n that you feel good about?\n\n2:58:08.120 --> 2:58:09.760\n Obviously very subjective, right?\n\n2:58:09.760 --> 2:58:13.200\n Some people save animals, some people save forests.\n\n2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:17.640\n We and I are creating this system of economic fairness\n\n2:58:17.640 --> 2:58:19.120\n and transparency.\n\n2:58:19.120 --> 2:58:22.920\n I feel that I'm in a good position to enable that.\n\n2:58:22.920 --> 2:58:25.680\n I feel that I have a good chance of succeeding at that.\n\n2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:29.080\n And I think that the impact will be quite meaningful\n\n2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:30.720\n for a large number of people.\n\n2:58:30.720 --> 2:58:34.120\n And so I'm completely happy to look back\n\n2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:37.360\n once I made it and see a body of work that achieved that\n\n2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:38.520\n and be very proud of that, right?\n\n2:58:38.520 --> 2:58:40.440\n Because I think that's what I'll be doing\n\n2:58:40.440 --> 2:58:42.120\n when I'm looking back.\n\n2:58:42.120 --> 2:58:43.040\n Well, I agree with you.\n\n2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:48.040\n The scale of impact as a hybrid smart contracts,\n\n2:58:48.400 --> 2:58:50.760\n this whole idea that you're working on\n\n2:58:50.760 --> 2:58:55.360\n has a potential to transform the world for the better\n\n2:58:55.360 --> 2:59:00.360\n at a scale that I can't even imagine.\n\n2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:03.720\n So speaking of which means even more\n\n2:59:03.720 --> 2:59:05.880\n that you would waste so many hours\n\n2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:07.520\n of that exciting life with me.\n\n2:59:07.520 --> 2:59:09.160\n Thank you so much for talking to me, Sergei.\n\n2:59:09.160 --> 2:59:11.320\n This is a really fascinating conversation,\n\n2:59:11.320 --> 2:59:14.680\n a really fascinating space, and I can't wait to learn more.\n\n2:59:14.680 --> 2:59:17.040\n So thank you so much for talking today.\n\n2:59:17.040 --> 2:59:17.880\n Thank you for having me.\n\n2:59:17.880 --> 2:59:19.980\n It's been an absolute pleasure.\n\n2:59:19.980 --> 2:59:21.560\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:59:21.560 --> 2:59:22.880\n with Sergei Nazarov.\n\n2:59:22.880 --> 2:59:27.520\n And thank you to Wine Access, Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon,\n\n2:59:27.520 --> 2:59:29.800\n Indeed, and BetterHelp.\n\n2:59:29.800 --> 2:59:33.520\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n2:59:33.520 --> 2:59:37.080\n And now let me leave you with some words from Copernicus.\n\n2:59:37.080 --> 2:59:39.560\n To know that we know what we know\n\n2:59:39.560 --> 2:59:43.160\n and to know that we do not know what we do not know,\n\n2:59:43.160 --> 2:59:45.640\n that is true knowledge.\n\n2:59:45.640 --> 3:00:04.640\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
