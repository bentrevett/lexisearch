This conversation is a wild technical roller coaster ride\n\n00:22.800 --> 00:28.160\n through topics of complexity, mathematics, physics, computing, and consciousness.\n\n00:28.160 --> 00:34.400\n I think this is what this podcast is becoming, a wild ride. Some episodes are about physics,\n\n00:34.400 --> 00:40.400\n some about robots, some are about war and power, some are about the human condition\n\n00:40.400 --> 00:46.480\n and our search for meaning, and some are just what the comedian Tim Dillon calls fun.\n\n00:47.680 --> 00:52.800\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast, to support it please check out the sponsors in the description,\n\n00:52.800 --> 00:56.480\n and now here's my conversation with Stephen Wolfram.\n\n00:56.480 --> 00:57.680\n Stephen.\n\n00:57.680 --> 01:03.120\n Almost 20 years ago, you published A New Kind of Science, where you presented a study of\n\n01:03.120 --> 01:10.160\n complexity and an approach for modeling of complex systems. So, let us return again to\n\n01:10.160 --> 01:15.360\n the core idea of complexity. What is complexity?\n\n01:15.360 --> 01:19.200\n I don't know, I think that's not the most interesting question. It's like,\n\n01:19.200 --> 01:24.560\n you know, if you ask a biologist what is life, that's not the question they care the most about.\n\n01:24.560 --> 01:31.440\n But what I was interested in is, how does something that we would usually identify as\n\n01:31.440 --> 01:35.920\n complexity arise in nature? And I got interested in that question like 50 years ago, which is\n\n01:35.920 --> 01:41.920\n really embarrassingly long time ago. And, you know, I was, you know, how does snowflakes get\n\n01:41.920 --> 01:47.680\n to have complicated forms? How do galaxies get to have complicated shapes? How do living systems\n\n01:47.680 --> 01:52.560\n get produced? Things like that. And the question is, what's the sort of underlying scientific\n\n01:52.560 --> 01:57.840\n basis for those kinds of things? And the thing that I was at first very surprised by, because\n\n01:57.840 --> 02:02.160\n I've been doing physics and particle physics, some fancy mathematical physics and so on.\n\n02:02.160 --> 02:06.320\n And it's like, I know all this fancy stuff, I should be able to solve this sort of basic\n\n02:06.320 --> 02:13.920\n science question. And I couldn't, this was like early, maybe 1980 ish timeframe. And it's like,\n\n02:13.920 --> 02:19.280\n okay, what can one do to understand the sort of basic secret that nature seems to have?\n\n02:19.280 --> 02:22.960\n Because it seems like nature, you look around in the natural world, it's full of incredibly\n\n02:22.960 --> 02:28.640\n complicated forms. You look at sort of most engineered kinds of things, for instance,\n\n02:28.640 --> 02:34.080\n they tend to be, you know, we've got sort of circles and lines and things like this.\n\n02:34.080 --> 02:38.640\n And the question is, what secret does nature have that lets it make all this complexity\n\n02:38.640 --> 02:42.960\n that we in doing engineering, for example, don't naturally seem to have?\n\n02:42.960 --> 02:46.800\n And so that was the kind of the thing that I got interested in. And then the question was,\n\n02:46.800 --> 02:51.120\n you know, could I understand that with things like mathematical physics? Well, it didn't work\n\n02:51.120 --> 02:56.640\n very well. So then I got to thinking about, okay, is there some other way to try to understand this?\n\n02:56.640 --> 03:00.160\n And then the question was, if you're going to look at some system in nature,\n\n03:00.160 --> 03:03.760\n how do you make a model for that system, for what that system does? So, you know,\n\n03:03.760 --> 03:08.800\n a model is some abstract representation of the system, some formal representation system.\n\n03:08.800 --> 03:15.120\n What is the raw material that you can make that model out of? And so what I realized was,\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:20.480\n well, actually, programs are a really good source of raw material for making models of things.\n\n03:20.480 --> 03:26.480\n And, you know, in terms of my personal history, to me, that seemed really obvious. And the reason\n\n03:26.480 --> 03:30.960\n it seemed really obvious is because I just spent several years building this big piece of software\n\n03:30.960 --> 03:35.600\n that was sort of a predecessor to Mathematica and Morphan Language, then called SMP, Symbolic\n\n03:35.600 --> 03:41.600\n Manipulation Program, which was something that had this idea of starting from just these\n\n03:41.600 --> 03:46.560\n computational primitives and building up everything one had to build up. And so kind of the notion of,\n\n03:46.560 --> 03:50.480\n well, let's just try and make models by starting from computational primitives and seeing what we\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:56.800\n can build up, that seemed like a totally obvious thing to do. In retrospect, it might not have been\n\n03:56.800 --> 04:00.880\n externally quite so obvious, but it was obvious to me at the time, given the path that I happened\n\n04:00.880 --> 04:06.000\n to have been on. So, you know, so that got me into this question of, let's use programs\n\n04:06.000 --> 04:11.040\n to model what happens in nature. And the question then is, well, what kind of programs?\n\n04:11.040 --> 04:15.120\n And, you know, we're used to programs that you write for some particular purpose, and it's a\n\n04:15.120 --> 04:20.400\n big, long piece of code, and it does some specific thing. But what I got interested in was, okay,\n\n04:20.400 --> 04:24.640\n if you just go out into the sort of computational universe of possible programs, you say,\n\n04:25.280 --> 04:30.720\n take the simplest program you can imagine, what does it do? And so I started studying these things\n\n04:30.720 --> 04:34.720\n called cellular automata. Actually, I didn't know at first they were called cellular automata,\n\n04:34.720 --> 04:39.600\n but I found that out subsequently. But it's just a line of cells, you know, each one is black or\n\n04:39.600 --> 04:44.800\n white, and it's just some rule that says the color of the cell is determined by the color that it had\n\n04:44.800 --> 04:49.600\n on the previous step and its two neighbors on the previous step. And I had initially thought,\n\n04:50.480 --> 04:55.280\n that's, you know, sufficiently simple setup is not going to do anything interesting. It's always\n\n04:55.280 --> 05:00.720\n going to be simple, no complexity, simple rule, simple behavior. Okay, but then I actually ran\n\n05:00.720 --> 05:05.280\n the computer experiment, which was pretty easy to do. I mean, it probably took a few hours\n\n05:05.280 --> 05:12.400\n originally. And the results were not what I'd expected at all. Now, needless to say,\n\n05:12.400 --> 05:16.800\n in the way that science actually works, the results that I got had a lot of unexpected\n\n05:16.800 --> 05:21.040\n things which I thought were really interesting, but the really strongest results, which was\n\n05:21.040 --> 05:24.960\n already right there in the printouts I made, I didn't really understand for a couple more years.\n\n05:25.520 --> 05:31.200\n So it was not, you know, the compressed version of the story is you run the experiment and you\n\n05:31.200 --> 05:36.640\n immediately see what's going on, but I wasn't smart enough to do that, so to speak. But the\n\n05:36.640 --> 05:43.520\n big thing is, even with very simple rules of that type, sort of the minimal, tiniest program,\n\n05:43.520 --> 05:49.520\n sort of the one line program or something, it's possible to get very complicated behavior. My\n\n05:49.520 --> 05:54.000\n favorite example is this thing called Rule 30, which is a particular cellular automaton rule.\n\n05:54.000 --> 06:00.240\n You just started off from one black cell and it makes this really complicated pattern. And so that\n\n06:00.240 --> 06:07.600\n for me was sort of a critical discovery that then kind of said, playing back onto, you know,\n\n06:07.600 --> 06:12.320\n how does nature make complexity, I sort of realized that might be how it does it.\n\n06:12.320 --> 06:16.400\n That might be kind of the secret that it's using is that in this kind of computational\n\n06:16.400 --> 06:20.960\n universe of possible programs, it's actually pretty easy to get programs where even though\n\n06:20.960 --> 06:24.720\n the program is simple, the behavior when you run the program is not simple at all.\n\n06:24.720 --> 06:33.120\n And so for me, that was the kind of the story of kind of how that was sort of the indication that\n\n06:33.120 --> 06:38.960\n one had got an idea of what the sort of secret that nature uses to make complexity and how\n\n06:38.960 --> 06:44.240\n complexity can be made in other places. Now, if you say, what is complexity? You know,\n\n06:46.080 --> 06:52.560\n complexity is it's not easy to tell what's going on. That's the informal version of what is\n\n06:52.560 --> 06:57.360\n complexity, but there is something going on, but there's a rule to know what, right? Well, no,\n\n06:57.360 --> 07:04.160\n the rules can generate just randomness, right? Well, that's not obvious. In other words,\n\n07:04.880 --> 07:09.520\n it's not obvious at all. And it wasn't what I expected. It's not what people's intuition\n\n07:09.520 --> 07:14.800\n had been and has been for, you know, for a long time. That is one might think you have a rule.\n\n07:15.440 --> 07:20.960\n You can tell there's a rule behind it. I mean, it's just like, you know, the early, you know,\n\n07:20.960 --> 07:26.720\n robots in science fiction movies, right? You can tell it's a robot cause it does simple things,\n\n07:27.280 --> 07:31.840\n right? It turns out that isn't actually the right story, but it's not obvious that isn't the right\n\n07:31.840 --> 07:37.680\n story because people assume simple rules, simple behavior. And that the sort of the key discovery\n\n07:37.680 --> 07:43.360\n about the computational universe is that isn't true. And that discovery goes very deep and\n\n07:43.360 --> 07:48.960\n relates to all kinds of things that I've spent years and years studying. But, you know, that in\n\n07:48.960 --> 07:54.240\n the end, the sort of the, the what is complexity is, well, you can't easily tell what it's going\n\n07:54.240 --> 08:00.080\n to do. You could just run the rule and see what happens, but you can't just say, oh, you know,\n\n08:00.080 --> 08:04.960\n show me the rule. Great. And now I know what's going to happen. And, you know, the key phenomenon\n\n08:04.960 --> 08:11.120\n around that is this thing I call computational irreducibility. This fact that in something like\n\n08:11.120 --> 08:16.240\n rule 30, you might say, well, what's it going to do after a million steps? Well, you can run it\n\n08:16.240 --> 08:21.520\n for a million steps and just do what it does to find out, but you can't compress that. You can't\n\n08:21.520 --> 08:25.920\n reduce that and say, I'm going to be able to jump ahead and say, this is what it's going to do after\n\n08:25.920 --> 08:29.040\n a million steps, but I don't have to go through anything like that computational effort.\n\n08:29.040 --> 08:33.200\n CB. By the way, has anybody succeeded at that? Do you have to challenge a competition\n\n08:34.080 --> 08:37.040\n for predicting the middle column of rule 30? Anybody?\n\n08:37.040 --> 08:41.600\n MG. A number of people have sent things in and sort of people are picking away at it,\n\n08:41.600 --> 08:50.400\n but it's hard. I mean, I've been actually even proving that the center column of rule 30 doesn't\n\n08:50.400 --> 08:54.240\n repeat. That's something I think might be doable. Okay?\n\n08:54.240 --> 08:55.520\n CB. Mathematically proving.\n\n08:55.520 --> 09:00.880\n MG. Yes. And so that's analogous to a similar kind of thing as like the digits of pi,\n\n09:00.880 --> 09:06.000\n which are also generated in this very deterministic way. And so a question is how random are the\n\n09:06.000 --> 09:11.760\n digits of pi? For example, first of all, do the digits of pi ever repeat? We know they don't,\n\n09:11.760 --> 09:17.280\n because it was proved in the 1800s that pi is not a rational number. So that means only rational\n\n09:17.280 --> 09:21.360\n numbers have digit sequences that repeat. So we know the digits of pi don't repeat.\n\n09:21.360 --> 09:27.200\n So now the question is, does 0, 1, 2, 3 or whatever, do all the digits base 10 or base 2 or\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:33.040\n however you work it out, do they all occur with equal frequency? Nobody knows. That's far away\n\n09:33.040 --> 09:41.280\n from what can be understood mathematically at this point. But I'm even looking for step one,\n\n09:41.280 --> 09:46.800\n which is prove that the center column doesn't repeat and then prove other things about it,\n\n09:46.800 --> 09:52.480\n like equidistribution of equal numbers of zeros and ones. And those are things which I kind of\n\n09:52.480 --> 09:59.120\n set up this little prize thing because I thought those were not too out of range. Those are things\n\n09:59.120 --> 10:06.560\n which are within a modest amount of time, it's conceivable that those could be done. They're not\n\n10:06.560 --> 10:11.440\n far away from what current mathematics might allow. They'll require a bunch of cleverness\n\n10:11.440 --> 10:15.680\n and hopefully some interesting new ideas that will be useful other places.\n\n10:16.400 --> 10:23.360\n But you started in 1980 with this idea before I think you realized this idea of programs.\n\n10:23.360 --> 10:29.680\n You thought that there might be some kind of a thermodynamic randomness and then complexity\n\n10:29.680 --> 10:37.840\n comes from a clever filter that you kind of like, I don't know, spaghetti or something. You filter\n\n10:37.840 --> 10:43.200\n the randomness and outcomes complexity, which is an interesting intuition. How do we know that's\n\n10:43.200 --> 10:50.560\n not actually what's happening? So just because you were then able to develop, look, you don't need\n\n10:50.560 --> 10:56.640\n this like incredible randomness. You can just have very simple, predictable initial conditions\n\n10:56.640 --> 11:02.720\n and predictable rules. And then from that emerged complexity, still there might be some systems\n\n11:02.720 --> 11:11.120\n where it's filtering randomness on the inputs. Well, the point is when you have quotes randomness\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:15.120\n in the input, that means there's all kinds of information in the input. And in a sense,\n\n11:15.120 --> 11:21.280\n what you get out will be maybe just something close to what you put in. Like people are very\n\n11:21.280 --> 11:25.120\n in dynamical systems theory, sort of big area mathematics that developed\n\n11:25.840 --> 11:31.520\n from the early 1900s and really got big in the 1980s. An example of what people study\n\n11:31.520 --> 11:37.760\n there a lot and it's popular version is chaos theory. An example of what people study a lot\n\n11:37.760 --> 11:44.160\n is the shift map, which is basically taking 2x mod one to the fractional part of 2x,\n\n11:44.160 --> 11:49.840\n which is basically just taking digits in binary and shifting them to the left. So at every step,\n\n11:49.840 --> 11:54.880\n you get to see if you say, how big is this number that I got out? Well, the most important digit in\n\n11:54.880 --> 12:00.560\n that number is whatever ended up at the left hand end. But now if you start off from an arbitrary\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:06.400\n random number, which is quotes randomly chosen, so all its digits are random, then when you run\n\n12:06.400 --> 12:12.480\n that sort of chaos theory shift map, all that you get out is just whatever you put in. You just get\n\n12:12.480 --> 12:18.080\n to see what you... It's not obvious that you would excavate all of those digits. And if you're,\n\n12:18.080 --> 12:22.400\n for example, making a theory, I don't know, fluid mechanics, for example, if there was that\n\n12:22.400 --> 12:27.600\n phenomenon in fluid mechanics, then the equations of fluid mechanics can't be right. Because what\n\n12:27.600 --> 12:33.600\n that would be saying is the equations that it matters to the fluid, what happens in the fluid\n\n12:33.600 --> 12:40.080\n at the level of the millionth digit of the initial conditions, which is far below the point at which\n\n12:40.080 --> 12:44.560\n you're hitting sizes of molecules and things like that. So it's kind of almost explaining\n\n12:45.280 --> 12:50.080\n if that phenomenon is an important thing, it's kind of telling you that fluid dynamics,\n\n12:50.080 --> 12:54.400\n which describes fluids as continuous media and so on, isn't really right.\n\n12:54.400 --> 13:01.440\n But so this idea that... It's a tricky thing because as soon as you put randomness in,\n\n13:01.440 --> 13:07.360\n you have to know how much of what's coming out is what you put in versus how much is actually\n\n13:07.360 --> 13:11.280\n something that's being generated. And what's really nice about these systems where you just\n\n13:11.280 --> 13:17.600\n have very simple initial conditions and where you get random stuff out or seemingly random stuff out\n\n13:17.600 --> 13:21.920\n is you don't have that issue. You don't have to argue about, was there something complicated put\n\n13:21.920 --> 13:26.800\n in? Because it's plainly obvious there wasn't. Now, as a practical matter in doing experiments,\n\n13:26.800 --> 13:34.320\n the big thing is if the thing you see is complex and reproducible, then it didn't come from just\n\n13:34.320 --> 13:39.120\n filtering some, quotes, randomness from the outside world. It has to be something that is\n\n13:39.120 --> 13:45.760\n intrinsically made because it wouldn't otherwise be... It could be the case that you set things up\n\n13:45.760 --> 13:51.440\n and it's always the same each time and you say, well, it's kind of the same, but it's not random\n\n13:51.440 --> 13:57.040\n each time because it's kind of the definition of it being random is it was kind of picked at random\n\n13:57.040 --> 14:03.040\n each time, so to speak. So is it possible to for sure know that our universe does not at the\n\n14:03.040 --> 14:10.400\n fundamental level have randomness? Is it possible to conclusively say there's no randomness at the\n\n14:10.400 --> 14:16.240\n bottom? Well, it's an interesting question. I mean, you know, science, natural science is an\n\n14:16.240 --> 14:21.520\n inductive business, right? You observe a bunch of things and you say, can we fit these together?\n\n14:21.520 --> 14:27.680\n What is our hypothesis for what's going on? The thing that I think I can say fairly definitively\n\n14:27.680 --> 14:34.480\n is at this point, we understand enough about fundamental physics that if there was sort of\n\n14:34.480 --> 14:41.120\n an extra dice being thrown, it's something that doesn't need to be there. We can get what we see\n\n14:41.120 --> 14:49.360\n without that. Now, could you add that in as an extra little featureoid without breaking the\n\n14:49.360 --> 14:56.000\n universe? Probably, but in fact, almost certainly yes. But is it necessary for understanding the\n\n14:56.000 --> 15:03.360\n universe? No. And I think actually from a more fundamental point of view, I think I might be\n\n15:03.360 --> 15:07.680\n able to argue. So one of the things that I've been interested in and been pretty surprised that I've\n\n15:07.680 --> 15:13.520\n had anything sentient to say about is the question of why does the universe exist? I didn't think\n\n15:13.520 --> 15:18.400\n that was a question that I would, you know, I thought that was a far out there metaphysical\n\n15:18.400 --> 15:23.600\n kind of thing. Even the philosophers have stayed away from that question for the most part.\n\n15:23.600 --> 15:30.880\n It's such a kind of difficult to address question. But I actually think to my great surprise that\n\n15:30.880 --> 15:36.320\n from our physics project and so on, that it is possible to actually address that question and\n\n15:36.320 --> 15:40.960\n explain why the universe exists. And I kind of have a suspicion. I've not thought it through.\n\n15:40.960 --> 15:46.800\n I kind of have a suspicion that that explanation will eventually show you that in no meaningful\n\n15:46.800 --> 15:52.880\n sense can there be randomness underneath the universe. That is that if there is, it's something\n\n15:52.880 --> 15:59.600\n that is necessarily irrelevant to our perception of the universe. That is that it could be there,\n\n15:59.600 --> 16:04.400\n but doesn't matter because in a sense, we've already, you know, whatever it would do,\n\n16:04.400 --> 16:09.200\n whatever extra thing it would add is not relevant to our perception of what's going on.\n\n16:09.200 --> 16:17.680\n So why does the universe exist? How does the relevance of randomness connect to the big\n\n16:17.680 --> 16:23.040\n why question of the universe? So, OK, so I mean, why does the universe exist? Well, let's see.\n\n16:23.040 --> 16:28.800\n And is this the only universe we got? It's the only one that about that I'm pretty sure.\n\n16:28.800 --> 16:35.920\n So now maybe which one which of these topics is better to enter first? Why does the universe exist\n\n16:35.920 --> 16:41.600\n and why you think it's the only one that exists? Well, I think they're very closely related. OK.\n\n16:41.600 --> 16:47.040\n OK. So, I mean, the first thing, let's see, I mean, this why does the universe exist question\n\n16:47.040 --> 16:52.080\n is built on top of all these things that we've been figuring out about fundamental physics,\n\n16:52.640 --> 16:55.520\n because if you want to know why the universe exists, you kind of have to know what the\n\n16:55.520 --> 17:02.320\n universe is made of. And I think the well, let me let me describe a little bit about\n\n17:02.880 --> 17:07.040\n the why does the universe exist question. So the main issue is let's say you have a model\n\n17:07.040 --> 17:12.160\n for the universe and you say I've got this this program or something and you run it and you make\n\n17:12.160 --> 17:17.440\n the universe. Now you say, well, how do you actually why is that program actually running?\n\n17:17.440 --> 17:21.360\n And people say you've got this program that makes the universe. What computer is it running on?\n\n17:21.920 --> 17:27.120\n Right. What what does it mean? What actualizes something? You know, two plus two equals four.\n\n17:27.120 --> 17:31.280\n But that's different from saying this to a pile of two rocks, another pile of two rocks, and so\n\n17:31.280 --> 17:37.040\n many moves them together and makes four, so to speak. And so what is it that kind of turns it\n\n17:37.040 --> 17:43.440\n from being just this formal thing to being something that is actualized? OK, so there we\n\n17:43.440 --> 17:47.920\n have to start thinking about, well, well, what do we actually know about what's going on in the\n\n17:47.920 --> 17:53.360\n universe? Well, we are observers of this universe. But confusingly enough, we're part of this\n\n17:53.360 --> 17:59.440\n universe. So in a sense, we what what what if we say what do we what do we know about what's\n\n17:59.440 --> 18:04.400\n going on in the universe? Well, what we know is what sort of our consciousness records about\n\n18:04.400 --> 18:09.520\n what's going on in the universe. And consciousness is part of the fabric of the universe. So we're\n\n18:09.520 --> 18:15.120\n in it. Yes, we're in it. And maybe I should maybe I should start off by saying something about\n\n18:15.120 --> 18:23.040\n the consciousness story, because that's some. Maybe we should begin even before that at the\n\n18:23.040 --> 18:29.760\n very base layer of the Wolfram physics project. Maybe you can give a broad overview once again\n\n18:29.760 --> 18:36.160\n really quick about this hypergraph model. Yes. And also, what is it a year and a half ago since\n\n18:36.160 --> 18:42.240\n you've brought this project to the world? What is the status update where what are all the beautiful\n\n18:42.240 --> 18:48.240\n ideas you have come across? What are the interesting things you can mention? It's I mean,\n\n18:48.240 --> 18:53.680\n it's a it's a frigging Cambrian explosion. I mean, it's it's crazy. I mean, there are all these\n\n18:53.680 --> 18:58.960\n things which I've kind of wondered about for years. And suddenly, there's actually a way to\n\n18:58.960 --> 19:04.240\n think about them. And I really did not see. I mean, the real strength of what's happened,\n\n19:04.240 --> 19:09.120\n I absolutely did not see coming. And the real strength of it is we've got this model for physics,\n\n19:09.120 --> 19:13.680\n but it turns out it's a foundational kind of model. That's a different kind of computation\n\n19:13.680 --> 19:20.720\n like model that I'm kind of calling the sort of multi computational model. And that that kind of\n\n19:20.720 --> 19:26.640\n model is applicable not only to physics, but also to lots of other kinds of things. And one reason\n\n19:26.640 --> 19:31.920\n that's extremely powerful is because physics has been very successful. So we know a lot based on\n\n19:31.920 --> 19:37.040\n what we figured out in physics. And if we know that the same model governs physics and governs,\n\n19:37.040 --> 19:42.080\n I don't know, economics, linguistics, immunology, whatever, we know that the same kind of model\n\n19:42.080 --> 19:47.360\n governs those things. We can start using things that we've successfully discovered in physics\n\n19:47.360 --> 19:52.640\n and applying those intuitions in all these other areas. And that's that's pretty exciting and very\n\n19:52.640 --> 19:59.040\n and very surprising to me. And in fact, it's kind of like in the original story of sort of you go\n\n19:59.040 --> 20:03.920\n and you explain why is there complexity in the natural world, then you realize, well, there's all\n\n20:03.920 --> 20:08.320\n this complexity, there's all this computational irreducibility. You know, there's a lot we can't\n\n20:08.320 --> 20:12.560\n know about what's going to happen. It's kind of kind of very confusing thing for people who say,\n\n20:12.560 --> 20:16.080\n you know, science has nailed everything down. We're going to, you know, based on science,\n\n20:16.080 --> 20:20.080\n we can know everything. Well, actually, there's this computational irreducibility thing\n\n20:20.080 --> 20:25.040\n right in the middle of that, thrown up by science, so to speak. And then the question is, well,\n\n20:25.040 --> 20:29.440\n given computational irreducibility, how can we actually figure out anything about what happens\n\n20:29.440 --> 20:33.920\n in the world? Why aren't we why are we able to predict anything? Why are we able to operate in\n\n20:33.920 --> 20:39.200\n the world? And the answer is that we sort of live in these slices of computational reusability\n\n20:39.200 --> 20:45.440\n that exist in this kind of ocean of computational irreducibility. And it turns out that seems that\n\n20:45.440 --> 20:50.160\n it's a very fundamental feature of the kind of model that seems to operate in physics,\n\n20:50.800 --> 20:55.760\n and perhaps in a lot of these other areas, that there are these particular slices of\n\n20:55.760 --> 21:02.240\n computational reusability that are relevant to us. And those are the things that both allow us to\n\n21:02.240 --> 21:06.880\n operate in the world, and not just have everything be completely unpredictable. But there are also\n\n21:06.880 --> 21:12.960\n things that potentially give us what amount to sort of physics like laws in all these other areas.\n\n21:12.960 --> 21:17.440\n So that's, that's been sort of an exciting thing. But, but I would say that in general, for our\n\n21:17.440 --> 21:23.360\n project, it's been going spectacularly well. I mean, you know, I, it's very, honestly, it wasn't\n\n21:23.360 --> 21:27.840\n something I expected to happen in my lifetime. I mean, it's, you know, it's something where,\n\n21:28.400 --> 21:34.080\n where it's, it's an in fact, one of the things about it, some of the things that we've discovered,\n\n21:34.080 --> 21:40.240\n are things where I was pretty sure that wasn't how things worked. And turns out I'm wrong. And,\n\n21:40.240 --> 21:45.520\n you know, in a major area in metamathematics, I've been realizing that I something I've long\n\n21:45.520 --> 21:51.760\n believed we can talk about it later that that that just just really isn't right. But But I think that\n\n21:53.040 --> 21:58.560\n the the thing that so so what's happened with the physics project? I mean, you know, it's a\n\n21:59.440 --> 22:02.640\n can explain a little bit about how the how the model works. But basically,\n\n22:02.640 --> 22:08.880\n we can maybe ask you the following question. So it's easy through words describe how cellular\n\n22:08.880 --> 22:16.480\n automata works, you've you've explained this. And it's the fundamental mechanism by which you in\n\n22:16.480 --> 22:21.920\n your book, and you kind of science explored the idea of complexity and how to do science in this\n\n22:21.920 --> 22:30.640\n world of island reducible islands and irreducible general irreducibility. Okay, so how does the model\n\n22:30.640 --> 22:35.840\n of hypergraphs differ from cellular automata? And how does the idea of multi computation\n\n22:35.840 --> 22:42.160\n differ? Like, maybe that's a way to describe it. We're we're, you know, right. This is a, you know,\n\n22:42.160 --> 22:47.040\n my life is like all of our lives, something of a story of computational irreducibility. Yes.\n\n22:47.040 --> 22:52.240\n And, you know, it's been going for a few years now. So it's always a challenge to kind of find\n\n22:52.240 --> 22:57.200\n these appropriate pockets of reducibility. But let me see what I can do. So, so I mean,\n\n22:57.200 --> 23:03.760\n first of all, let's let's talk about physics, first of all. And, you know, a key observation,\n\n23:03.760 --> 23:09.680\n that one of the starting point of our physics project is things about what is space? What is\n\n23:09.680 --> 23:15.120\n the universe made of? And, you know, ever since Euclid, people just sort of say space is just this\n\n23:15.120 --> 23:19.600\n thing where you can put things at any position you want. And they're just points. And they're just\n\n23:19.600 --> 23:24.560\n geometrical things that you can just arbitrarily put at different different coordinate positions.\n\n23:25.040 --> 23:30.400\n So the first thing in our physics project is the idea that space is made of something, just like\n\n23:30.400 --> 23:36.240\n just like water is made of molecules, space is made of kind of atoms of space. And the only thing we\n\n23:36.240 --> 23:40.640\n can say about these atoms of space is they have some identity. There's a there's a there is it's\n\n23:40.640 --> 23:45.120\n this atom as opposed to this atom. And, you know, you could give them a few a computer person, you\n\n23:45.120 --> 23:54.960\n give them UUIDs or something. And that's all there is to say about them, so to speak. And then all we\n\n23:54.960 --> 24:02.480\n know about these atoms of space is how they relate to each other. So we say, these three atoms of\n\n24:02.480 --> 24:08.400\n space are associated with each other in some relation. So you can think about that as you know,\n\n24:08.400 --> 24:13.520\n what atom of space is friends with what other atom of space, you can build this essentially friend\n\n24:13.520 --> 24:18.800\n network of the atoms of space. And the sort of starting point of our physics project is that's\n\n24:18.800 --> 24:24.800\n what our universe is, it's a giant friend network of the atoms of space. And so how can that\n\n24:24.800 --> 24:31.360\n possibly represent our universe? Well, it's like in something like water, you know, their molecules\n\n24:31.360 --> 24:37.120\n bouncing around, but on a large scale that, you know, that produces fluid flow, and we have fluid\n\n24:37.120 --> 24:42.160\n vortices, and we have all of these phenomena that are sort of the emergent phenomena from that\n\n24:42.160 --> 24:47.360\n underlying kind of collection of molecules bouncing around. And by the way, it's important that that\n\n24:47.360 --> 24:51.760\n collection of molecules bouncing around have this phenomenon of computational irreducibility,\n\n24:51.760 --> 24:54.960\n that's actually what leads to the second law of thermodynamics among other things.\n\n24:55.520 --> 25:00.960\n And that leads to the sort of randomness of the underlying behavior, which is what gives you\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:07.840\n something which on a large scale seems like it's a smooth continuous type of thing. And so okay,\n\n25:07.840 --> 25:13.680\n so first thing is space is made of something, it's made of all these atoms of space connected\n\n25:13.680 --> 25:20.640\n together in this network. And then everything that we experience is sort of features of that\n\n25:20.640 --> 25:24.400\n structure of space. So, you know, when we have an electron or something or a photon,\n\n25:24.400 --> 25:29.360\n it's some kind of tangle in the structure of space, much like kind of a vortex in a fluid\n\n25:29.360 --> 25:34.160\n would be just this thing that is, you know, it can actually, the vortex can move around,\n\n25:34.160 --> 25:38.480\n it can involve different molecules in the fluid, but the vortex still stays there.\n\n25:38.480 --> 25:42.880\n And if you zoom out enough, the vortex looks like an atom itself, like a basic\n\n25:42.880 --> 25:49.680\n element. So there's the levels of abstraction. If you squint and kind of blur things out,\n\n25:49.680 --> 25:55.760\n it looks like at every level of abstraction, you can define what is a basic individual entity.\n\n25:55.760 --> 26:01.040\n Yes. But, you know, in this model, there's a bottom level, you know, there's an elementary\n\n26:01.040 --> 26:05.680\n length, maybe 10 to the minus 100 meters, let's say, which is really small, you know,\n\n26:05.680 --> 26:12.000\n proton is 10 to the minus 15 meters, the smallest we've ever been able to sort of see with a particle\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:17.760\n accelerator is around 10 to the minus 21 meters. So, you know, if we don't know precisely what\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:21.520\n the correct scale is, but it's perhaps over the order of 10 to the minus 100 meters, so it's\n\n26:21.520 --> 26:26.880\n pretty small. But that's the end, that's what things are made of.\n\n26:26.880 --> 26:32.400\n What's your intuition where the 10 to the minus 100 comes from? What's your intuition about this\n\n26:32.400 --> 26:33.360\n scale?\n\n26:33.360 --> 26:37.280\n Well, okay, so there's a calculation, which I consider to be somewhat rickety,\n\n26:37.280 --> 26:42.800\n okay, which has to do with comparing, so there are various fundamental constants,\n\n26:42.800 --> 26:46.880\n there's a speed of light, the speed of light, once you know the elementary time,\n\n26:46.880 --> 26:51.440\n the speed of light tells you the conversion from the elementary time to the elementary length.\n\n26:52.160 --> 26:56.960\n Then there's the question of how do you convert to the elementary energy? And how do you convert\n\n26:56.960 --> 27:00.960\n to between other things? And the various constants we know, we know the speed of light,\n\n27:00.960 --> 27:05.600\n we know the gravitational constant, we know Planck's constant and quantum mechanics,\n\n27:05.600 --> 27:09.920\n those are the three important ones. And we actually know some other things, we know things\n\n27:09.920 --> 27:15.120\n like the size of the universe, the Hubble constant, things like that. And essentially,\n\n27:15.120 --> 27:21.280\n this calculation of the elementary length comes from looking at the combination of those.\n\n27:21.280 --> 27:26.160\n Okay, so the most obvious thing, people have assumed that quantum gravity happens at this\n\n27:26.160 --> 27:32.080\n thing, the Planck scale, 10 to the minus 34 meters, which is the combination of Planck's\n\n27:32.080 --> 27:36.080\n constant and the gravitational constant, the speed of light, that gives you that kind of length.\n\n27:37.280 --> 27:42.960\n Turns out in our model, there is an additional parameter, which is essentially the number of\n\n27:42.960 --> 27:47.520\n simultaneous threads of execution of the universe, which is essentially the number of sort of\n\n27:47.520 --> 27:52.960\n independent quantum processes that are going on. And that number, let's see if I remember that\n\n27:52.960 --> 28:00.560\n number, that number is 10 to the 170, I think, and so it's a big number. But that number then\n\n28:00.560 --> 28:07.920\n connects, sort of modifies what you might think from all these Planck units to give you the things\n\n28:07.920 --> 28:12.560\n we're giving. And there's been sort of a mystery actually in the more technical physics thing,\n\n28:12.560 --> 28:19.440\n that the Planck mass, the Planck energy, Planck energy is actually surprisingly big. The Planck\n\n28:19.440 --> 28:24.000\n length is tiny, 10 to the minus 34 meters, you know, Planck time, 10 to the minus 43 meters,\n\n28:24.000 --> 28:32.080\n I think, seconds, I think. But the Planck energy is like the energy of a lightning strike,\n\n28:32.080 --> 28:38.240\n okay, which is pretty weird. In our models, the actual elementary energy is that divided by the\n\n28:38.240 --> 28:43.040\n number of sort of simultaneous quantum threads, and it ends up being really small too. And that\n\n28:43.040 --> 28:49.040\n sort of explains that mystery that's been around for a while about how Planck units work. But\n\n28:50.000 --> 28:54.800\n whether that precise estimate is right, we don't know yet. I mean, that's one of the things that's\n\n28:54.800 --> 29:00.400\n sort of been a thing we've been pretty interested in is how do you see through, you know, how do you\n\n29:00.400 --> 29:05.920\n make a gravitational microscope that can kind of see through to the atoms of space? You know,\n\n29:05.920 --> 29:10.480\n how do you get in fluid flow, for example, if you go to hypersonic flow or something, you know,\n\n29:10.480 --> 29:15.040\n you've got a Mach 20, you know, space plane or something, it really matters that there are\n\n29:15.040 --> 29:20.560\n individual molecules hitting the space plane, not a continuous fluid. The question is, what is the\n\n29:22.640 --> 29:30.480\n analog of hypersonic flow for things about the structure of spacetime? And it looks like a\n\n29:30.480 --> 29:38.880\n rapidly rotating black hole, right, at the sort of critical rotation rate, it looks as if that's\n\n29:38.880 --> 29:45.920\n a case where essentially the structure of spacetime is just about to fall apart, and you\n\n29:45.920 --> 29:52.640\n may be able to kind of see the evidence of sort of discrete elements, you know, you may be able\n\n29:52.640 --> 29:57.280\n to kind of see there the sort of gravitational microscope of actually seeing these discrete\n\n29:57.280 --> 30:03.520\n elements of space. And there may be some effect in, for example, gravitational waves produced by\n\n30:03.520 --> 30:08.480\n rapidly rotating black hole that in which one could actually see some phenomenon where one\n\n30:08.480 --> 30:14.640\n can say, yes, these don't come out the way one would expect based on having a continuous structure\n\n30:14.640 --> 30:19.120\n of spacetime, that is something where you can kind of see through to the discrete structure.\n\n30:19.840 --> 30:25.280\n We don't know that yet. So can you maybe elaborate a little bit deeper how a microscope that can see\n\n30:25.280 --> 30:36.320\n the 10 to the minus 100, how rotating black holes and presumably the detailed accurate\n\n30:36.320 --> 30:41.920\n detection of gravitational waves from such black holes can reveal the discreteness of space?\n\n30:42.800 --> 30:47.360\n Okay, first thing is, what is a black hole? Actually, we need to go a little bit further in\n\n30:47.360 --> 30:50.560\n the story of what spacetime is, because I explained a little bit about what space is,\n\n30:50.560 --> 30:55.600\n but I didn't talk about what time is. And that's sort of important in understanding spacetime,\n\n30:55.600 --> 30:59.920\n so to speak. And your sense is both space and time in the story are discrete.\n\n30:59.920 --> 31:05.360\n Absolutely. Absolutely. But it's a complicated story. And needless to say.\n\n31:05.360 --> 31:11.520\n Well, it's simple at the bottom. It's very simple at the bottom. In the end,\n\n31:11.520 --> 31:18.320\n it's simple but deeply abstract. And something that is simple in conception,\n\n31:18.320 --> 31:24.480\n but kind of wrapping one's head around what's going on is pretty hard. So first of all,\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:29.040\n we have this. So I've described these kind of atoms of space and their connections.\n\n31:29.040 --> 31:34.000\n You can think about these things as a hypergraph. A graph is just you connect nodes to nodes,\n\n31:34.000 --> 31:40.800\n but a hypergraph you can have not just individual friends to friends, but you can have these\n\n31:40.800 --> 31:47.200\n triplets of friends or whatever else. And so we're just saying that's just the relations\n\n31:47.200 --> 31:52.960\n between atoms of space are the hyperedges of the hypergraph. And so we got some big collection of\n\n31:52.960 --> 31:59.440\n these atoms of space, maybe 10 to the 400 or something in our universe. And that's the structure\n\n31:59.440 --> 32:07.120\n of space. And every feature of what we experience in the world is a feature of that hypergraph,\n\n32:07.120 --> 32:12.240\n that spatial hypergraph. So then the question is, well, what does that spatial hypergraph do?\n\n32:12.240 --> 32:18.800\n Well, the idea is that there are rules that update that spatial hypergraph. And in a cellular\n\n32:18.800 --> 32:23.760\n automaton, you've just got this line of cells and you just say at every step, at every time step,\n\n32:23.760 --> 32:29.120\n you've got fixed time steps, fixed array of cells. At every step, every cell gets updated\n\n32:29.120 --> 32:36.240\n according to a certain rule. And that's the way it works. Now in this hypergraph, it's sort of\n\n32:36.240 --> 32:40.800\n vaguely the same kind of thing. We say every time you see a little piece of hypergraph that looks\n\n32:40.800 --> 32:47.120\n like this, update it to one that looks like this. So just keep rewriting this hypergraph. Every time\n\n32:47.120 --> 32:51.920\n you see something that looks like that, anywhere in the universe, it gets rewritten. Now, one thing\n\n32:51.920 --> 32:56.640\n that's tricky about that, which we'll come to, is this multi computational idea, which has to do\n\n32:56.640 --> 33:02.560\n with you're not saying in some kind of lockstep way, do this one, then this one, then this one.\n\n33:02.560 --> 33:07.920\n It's just whenever you see one you can do, you can go ahead and do it. And that leads one not to\n\n33:07.920 --> 33:13.440\n have a single thread of time in the universe. Because if you knew which one to do, you just say,\n\n33:13.440 --> 33:17.360\n okay, we do this one, then we do this one, then we do this one. But if you say, just do whichever\n\n33:17.360 --> 33:21.520\n one you feel like, you end up with these multiple threads of time, these kind of multiple histories\n\n33:21.520 --> 33:26.000\n of the universe, depending on which order you happen to do the things you could do in.\n\n33:26.000 --> 33:28.880\n So it's fundamentally asynchronous and parallel.\n\n33:28.880 --> 33:30.240\n Yes. Yes.\n\n33:30.240 --> 33:35.200\n Which is very uncomfortable for the human brain that seeks for things to be sequential.\n\n33:35.200 --> 33:35.680\n Yes.\n\n33:35.680 --> 33:36.880\n And synchronous.\n\n33:36.880 --> 33:41.920\n Right. Well, I think that this is part of the story of consciousness,\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:48.400\n is I think the key aspect of consciousness that is important for sort of parsing the universe,\n\n33:48.400 --> 33:53.600\n is this point that we have a single thread of experience. We have a memory of what happened\n\n33:53.600 --> 33:57.600\n in the past. We can say something, predict something about the future, but there's a single\n\n33:57.600 --> 34:00.880\n thread of experience. And it's not obvious it should work that way. I mean, we've got 100\n\n34:00.880 --> 34:04.480\n billion neurons in our brains and they're all firing at all kinds of different ways.\n\n34:04.480 --> 34:12.880\n But yet, our experience is that there is the single thread of time that goes along. And I\n\n34:12.880 --> 34:18.000\n think that one of the things I've kind of realized with a lot more clarity in the last year is the\n\n34:18.000 --> 34:24.240\n fact that the fact that we conclude that the universe has the laws it has is a consequence\n\n34:24.240 --> 34:31.120\n of the fact that we have consciousness the way we have consciousness. And so, just to go on with\n\n34:31.120 --> 34:36.800\n kind of the basic setup, so we've got this spatial hypergraph, it's got all these atoms of space,\n\n34:38.160 --> 34:41.200\n they're getting these little clumps of atoms of space, they're getting turned into other clumps\n\n34:41.200 --> 34:45.040\n of atoms of space, and that's happening everywhere in the universe all the time. And so, one thing\n\n34:45.040 --> 34:49.280\n that's a little bit weird is there's nothing permanent in the universe. The universe is getting\n\n34:49.280 --> 34:53.840\n rewritten everywhere all the time. And if it wasn't getting rewritten, space wouldn't be knitted\n\n34:53.840 --> 34:58.560\n together. That is, space would just fall apart. There wouldn't be any way in which we could say\n\n34:58.560 --> 35:04.880\n this part of space is next to this part of space. One of the things that people were confused about\n\n35:04.880 --> 35:11.440\n back in antiquity, the ancient Greek philosophers and so on, is how does motion work? How can it be\n\n35:11.440 --> 35:16.800\n the case that you can take a thing that we can walk around and it's still us when we walked a\n\n35:16.800 --> 35:23.040\n foot forward, so to speak? And in a sense, with our models, that's again a question because it's\n\n35:23.040 --> 35:29.200\n a different set of atoms of space. When I move my hand, it's moving into a different set of atoms\n\n35:29.200 --> 35:35.360\n of space. It's having to be recreated. The thing itself is not there. It's being continuously\n\n35:35.360 --> 35:40.560\n recreated all the time. Now, it's a little bit like waves in an ocean, vortices in a fluid,\n\n35:40.560 --> 35:46.080\n which again, the actual molecules that exist in those are not what define the identity of the\n\n35:46.080 --> 35:55.280\n thing. But this idea that there can be pure motion, that it is even possible for an object\n\n35:55.280 --> 36:00.480\n to just move around in the universe and not change, it's not self evident that such a thing\n\n36:00.480 --> 36:06.560\n should be possible. And that is part of our perception of the universe is that we parse\n\n36:06.560 --> 36:11.360\n those aspects of the universe where things like pure motion are possible. Now, pure motion,\n\n36:11.360 --> 36:16.400\n even in general relativity, the theory of gravity, pure motion is a little bit of a complicated\n\n36:16.400 --> 36:21.760\n thing. I mean, if you imagine your average teacup or something approaching a black hole,\n\n36:21.760 --> 36:27.600\n it is deformed and distorted by the structure of space time. And to say, is it really pure motion?\n\n36:27.600 --> 36:32.320\n Is it that same teacup that's the same shape? Well, it's a bit of a complicated story. And this\n\n36:32.320 --> 36:38.880\n is a more extreme version of that. So anyway, the thing that's happening is we've got space,\n\n36:38.880 --> 36:45.360\n we've got this notion of time. So time is this kind of this rewriting of the hypergraph. And one\n\n36:45.360 --> 36:50.000\n of the things that's important about that time is this sort of computational irreducible process.\n\n36:50.000 --> 36:56.080\n There's something, you know, time is not something where it's kind of the mathematical view of time\n\n36:56.080 --> 37:01.440\n tends to be time is just to coordinate. We can, you know, slide a slider, turn a knob,\n\n37:01.440 --> 37:06.800\n and we'll change the time that we've got in this equation. But in this picture of time,\n\n37:06.800 --> 37:12.960\n that's not how it works at all. Time is this inexorable, irreducible kind of set of computations\n\n37:12.960 --> 37:20.240\n that go on, that go from where we are now to the future. And one of the things that is, again,\n\n37:20.240 --> 37:25.200\n something one sort of has to break out of is your average trained physicist like me says,\n\n37:25.200 --> 37:29.200\n you know, space and time are the same kind of thing. They're related by, you know,\n\n37:29.200 --> 37:34.160\n the Poincare group and Lorentz transformations and relativity and all these kinds of things.\n\n37:34.160 --> 37:38.880\n And, you know, space and time, you know, there are all these kind of sort of folk stories you\n\n37:38.880 --> 37:43.440\n can tell about why space and time are the same kind of thing. In this model, they're fundamentally\n\n37:43.440 --> 37:49.360\n not the same kind of thing. Space is this kind of sort of connections between these atoms of space.\n\n37:49.360 --> 37:55.040\n Time is this computational process. So the thing that the first sort of surprising thing is, well,\n\n37:55.040 --> 38:00.160\n it turns out you get relativity anyway. And the reason that happens, there are a few bits and\n\n38:00.160 --> 38:06.560\n pieces here which one has to understand. But the fundamental point is if you are an observer\n\n38:06.560 --> 38:12.720\n embedded in the system that are part of this whole story of things getting updated in this way and\n\n38:12.720 --> 38:18.160\n that, there's sort of a limit to what you can tell about what's going on. And really, in the end,\n\n38:18.160 --> 38:24.720\n the only thing you can tell is what are the causal relationships between events. So an event in this\n\n38:24.720 --> 38:31.200\n sort of an elementary event is a little piece of hypergraph got rewritten. And that means a few\n\n38:31.200 --> 38:36.720\n hyper edges of the hypergraph were consumed by the event and you produce some other hyper edges.\n\n38:36.720 --> 38:43.520\n And that's an elementary event. And so then the question is what we can tell is kind of what the\n\n38:43.520 --> 38:48.080\n network of causal relationships between elementary events is. That's the ultimate thing,\n\n38:48.080 --> 38:53.920\n the causal graph of the universe. And it turns out that, well, there's this property of causal\n\n38:53.920 --> 38:59.840\n invariance that is true of a bunch of these models and I think is inevitably true for a variety of\n\n38:59.840 --> 39:08.160\n reasons that makes it be the case that it doesn't matter kind of if you are sort of saying, well,\n\n39:08.160 --> 39:12.160\n I've got this hypergraph and I can rewrite this piece here and this piece here and I do them all\n\n39:12.160 --> 39:17.760\n in different orders. When you construct the causal graph for each of those orders that you choose to\n\n39:17.760 --> 39:24.480\n do things in, you'll end up with the same causal graph. And so that's essentially why, well,\n\n39:24.480 --> 39:31.920\n that's in the end why relativity works. It's why our perception of space and time is as having\n\n39:31.920 --> 39:37.120\n this kind of connection that relativity says they should have. And that's kind of how that works.\n\n39:37.760 --> 39:42.480\n I think I'm missing a little piece. If we can go there again, you said the fact that the\n\n39:42.480 --> 39:50.400\n observer is embedded in this hypergraph, what's missing? What is the observer not able to state\n\n39:50.400 --> 39:55.440\n about this universe of space and time? If you look from the outside, you can say,\n\n39:55.440 --> 40:05.120\n oh, I see this particular place was updated and then this one was updated and I'm seeing which\n\n40:05.120 --> 40:09.760\n order things were updated in. But the observer embedded in the universe doesn't know which order\n\n40:09.760 --> 40:14.720\n things were updated in because until they've been updated, they have no idea what else happened.\n\n40:14.720 --> 40:20.240\n So the only thing they know is the set of causal relationships. Let me give an extreme example.\n\n40:20.240 --> 40:25.040\n Let's imagine that the universe is a Turing machine. Turing machines have just this one\n\n40:25.040 --> 40:29.280\n update head which does something and otherwise the Turing machine just does nothing.\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:35.680\n And the Turing machine works by having this head move around and do its updating just where the\n\n40:35.680 --> 40:40.400\n head happens to be. The question is, could the universe be a Turing machine? Could the universe\n\n40:40.400 --> 40:44.320\n just have a single updating head that's just zipping around all over the place? You say,\n\n40:44.320 --> 40:49.520\n that's crazy because I'm talking to you, you seem to be updating, I'm updating,\n\n40:49.520 --> 40:53.600\n et cetera. But the thing is, there's no way to know that because if there was just this head\n\n40:53.600 --> 40:58.960\n moving around, it's like, okay, it updates me, but you're completely frozen at that point.\n\n40:58.960 --> 41:02.720\n Until the head has come over and updated you, you have no idea what happened to me.\n\n41:02.720 --> 41:07.200\n And so if you sort of unravel that argument, you realize the only thing we actually can tell\n\n41:07.680 --> 41:13.040\n is what the network of causal relationships between the things that happened were. We don't\n\n41:13.040 --> 41:19.280\n get to know from some sort of outside, sort of God's eye view of the thing. We don't get to know\n\n41:19.840 --> 41:26.080\n what sort of from the outside, what happened. We only get to know sort of what the set of\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:28.880\n relationships between the things that happened actually were.\n\n41:28.880 --> 41:36.240\n Yeah. But if I somehow record like a trace of this, I guess it would be called multi computation.\n\n41:36.880 --> 41:40.560\n Can't I then look back in the causal tree?\n\n41:40.560 --> 41:41.760\n Where do you record the trace?\n\n41:42.720 --> 41:50.080\n Some, you place throughout the universe, like throughout like a log that records in my own\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:56.880\n pocket of, in this hypergraph. Can't I, like realizing that I'm getting an outdated picture,\n\n41:56.880 --> 41:58.560\n can't I record?\n\n41:58.560 --> 42:03.760\n See, the problem is, and this is where things start getting very entangled in terms of what\n\n42:03.760 --> 42:10.080\n one understands. The problem is that any such recording device is itself part of the universe.\n\n42:10.080 --> 42:10.580\n Yeah.\n\n42:10.580 --> 42:15.760\n So you don't get to say, you never get to say, let's go outside the universe and go do this.\n\n42:16.560 --> 42:22.560\n And that's why, I mean, lots of the features of this model and the way things work end up being\n\n42:22.560 --> 42:23.600\n a result of that.\n\n42:23.600 --> 42:30.240\n So, but what, I guess from on a human level, what is the cost you're paying? What are you missing\n\n42:30.240 --> 42:34.960\n from not getting an updated picture all the time? Okay. I got, I understand what you're saying.\n\n42:34.960 --> 42:35.520\n Yeah, yeah, right.\n\n42:35.520 --> 42:41.760\n But like what, like, how does consciousness emerge from that? Like how, like, what are\n\n42:41.760 --> 42:45.200\n the limitations of that observer? I understand you're getting a delayed picture.\n\n42:45.200 --> 42:50.320\n Well, there's, there's a, okay. So there's, there's a bunch of limitations of the observer, I think.\n\n42:50.320 --> 42:54.480\n Yeah. Maybe just explain something about quantum mechanics, because that maybe is a,\n\n42:54.480 --> 42:59.680\n is an extreme version of some of these issues, which helps to kind of motivate why one should\n\n42:59.680 --> 43:05.280\n sort of think things through a little bit more carefully. So one feature of the, of this, okay.\n\n43:05.280 --> 43:10.960\n So in standard physics, like high school physics, you learn, you know, the equations of motion for\n\n43:10.960 --> 43:16.800\n a ball and the, the, you know, it says you throw the ball this angle, this velocity,\n\n43:16.800 --> 43:21.920\n things will move in this way. And there's a definite answer, right? The story, the key story\n\n43:21.920 --> 43:25.840\n of quantum mechanics is there aren't definite answers to where does the ball go? There's kind\n\n43:25.840 --> 43:32.080\n of this whole sort of bundle of possible paths. And all we say we know from quantum mechanics\n\n43:32.080 --> 43:36.720\n is certain probabilities for where the ball will end up. Okay. So that's kind of the,\n\n43:36.720 --> 43:42.080\n the core idea of quantum mechanics. So in our models, you, quantum mechanics is not some kind\n\n43:42.080 --> 43:47.280\n of plugin add on type thing. You absolutely cannot get away from quantum mechanics because\n\n43:47.280 --> 43:51.760\n as you think about updating this hypergraph, there isn't just one sequence of things,\n\n43:51.760 --> 43:55.600\n one definite sequence of things that can happen. There are all these different possible update\n\n43:55.600 --> 43:59.760\n sequences that can occur. You could do this, you know, piece of the hypergraph now, and then this\n\n43:59.760 --> 44:05.200\n one later and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. All those different paths of history correspond to\n\n44:05.200 --> 44:10.720\n these quantum, quantum paths and quantum mechanics, these different possible quantum histories.\n\n44:10.720 --> 44:15.760\n And one of the things that's kind of surprising about it is they, they branch, you know, there can\n\n44:15.760 --> 44:20.640\n be a certain state of the universe and it could do this or it could do that, but they can also\n\n44:20.640 --> 44:25.680\n merge. There can be two states of the universe, which their next state, the next state they\n\n44:25.680 --> 44:30.400\n produce is the same for both of them. And that process of branching and merging is kind of\n\n44:30.400 --> 44:34.400\n critical. And the idea that there can be merging is critical and somewhat non trivial for these\n\n44:34.400 --> 44:39.040\n hypergraphs because there's a whole graph isomorphism story and there's a whole very\n\n44:39.040 --> 44:47.680\n elaborate set of mathematics. Yes. Among other things. Right. Yes. But so then what happens is\n\n44:47.680 --> 44:53.360\n that what one's seeing, okay, so we've got this thing, it's branching, it's merging, et cetera,\n\n44:53.360 --> 45:01.120\n et cetera, et cetera. Okay. So now the question is how do we perceive that? Why don't we notice\n\n45:01.120 --> 45:06.000\n that the universe is branching and merging? Why is it the case that we just think a definite set\n\n45:06.000 --> 45:11.520\n of things happen? Well, the answer is we are embedded in that universe and our brains are\n\n45:11.520 --> 45:16.720\n branching and merging too. And so what quantum mechanics becomes a story of is how does a\n\n45:16.720 --> 45:23.760\n branching brain perceive a branching universe? And the key thing is as soon as you say,\n\n45:23.760 --> 45:28.720\n I think definite things happen in the universe, that means you are essentially conflating\n\n45:28.720 --> 45:33.440\n lots of different parts of history. You're saying, actually, as far as I'm concerned,\n\n45:33.440 --> 45:38.160\n because I'm convinced that definite things happen in the universe, all these parts of history must\n\n45:38.160 --> 45:42.720\n be equivalent. Now, it's not obvious that that would be a consistent thing to do. It might be,\n\n45:42.720 --> 45:47.200\n you say, all these parts of history are equivalent, but by golly, moments later,\n\n45:47.200 --> 45:51.280\n that would be a completely inconsistent point of view. Everything would have gone to hell in\n\n45:51.280 --> 45:56.000\n different ways. The fact that that doesn't happen is, well, that's a consequence of this causal\n\n45:56.000 --> 46:01.520\n invariance thing. And the fact that that does happen a little bit is what causes little quantum\n\n46:01.520 --> 46:08.400\n effects. And if that didn't happen at all, there wouldn't be anything that sort of is like quantum\n\n46:08.400 --> 46:16.640\n mechanics. Quantum mechanics is kind of like in this bundle of paths. It's a little bit like what\n\n46:16.640 --> 46:20.880\n happens in statistical mechanics and fluid mechanics, whatever, that most of the time,\n\n46:20.880 --> 46:25.120\n you just see this continuous fluid. You just see the world just progressing in this kind of way\n\n46:25.120 --> 46:29.440\n that's like this continuous fluid. But every so often, if you look at the exact right experiment,\n\n46:29.440 --> 46:33.280\n you can start seeing, well, actually, it's made of these molecules where they might go that way,\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:40.400\n or they might go this way, and that's kind of quantum effects. And so, this kind of idea of\n\n46:41.040 --> 46:45.760\n where we're sort of embedded in the universe, this branching brain is perceiving this branching\n\n46:45.760 --> 46:51.600\n universe, and that ends up being sort of a story of quantum mechanics. That's part of the whole\n\n46:51.600 --> 46:56.880\n picture of what's going on. But I think, I mean, to come back to sort of what is the story of\n\n46:56.880 --> 47:03.200\n consciousness. So, in the universe, we've got whatever it is, 10 to the 400 atoms of space,\n\n47:03.200 --> 47:08.320\n they're all doing these complicated things. It's all a big, complicated, irreducible computation.\n\n47:08.320 --> 47:15.600\n The question is, what do we perceive from all of that? And the answer is that we are parsing the\n\n47:15.600 --> 47:23.520\n universe in a particular way. Let me again go back to the gas molecules analogy. In the gas in this\n\n47:23.520 --> 47:28.320\n room, there are molecules bouncing around all kinds of complicated patterns, but we don't care.\n\n47:28.320 --> 47:34.960\n All we notice is there's, you know, the gas laws are satisfied. Maybe there's some fluid dynamics.\n\n47:34.960 --> 47:40.480\n These are kind of features of that assembly of molecules that we notice, and then lots of details\n\n47:40.480 --> 47:44.960\n we don't notice. When you say we, do you mean the tools of physics, or do you mean literally\n\n47:44.960 --> 47:50.240\n the human brain and its perception system? Well, okay. So, the human brain is where it starts,\n\n47:50.240 --> 47:53.840\n but we've built a bunch of instruments to do a bit better than the human brain, but they still\n\n47:53.840 --> 47:58.640\n have many of the same kinds of ideas, you know, their cameras and their pressure sensors and\n\n47:58.640 --> 48:04.160\n these kinds of things. They're not, you know, at this point, we don't know how to make\n\n48:04.160 --> 48:09.440\n fundamentally qualitatively different sensory devices. Right. So, it's always just an extension\n\n48:09.440 --> 48:14.720\n of the consciousness experience. Or our sensory experience. Sensory experience, but\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:20.240\n sensory experience is somehow intricately tied to consciousness. Right. Well, so one question is,\n\n48:20.240 --> 48:24.480\n when we are looking at all these molecules in the gas, and there might be 10 to the 20th molecules\n\n48:24.480 --> 48:30.240\n in some little box or something, it's like, what do we notice about those molecules? So,\n\n48:30.240 --> 48:36.640\n one thing that we can say is, we don't notice that much. We are, you know, we are computationally\n\n48:36.640 --> 48:43.120\n bounded observers. We can't go in and say, okay, I'm the 10 to the 20th molecules, and I know\n\n48:43.120 --> 48:47.440\n that I can sort of decrypt their motions, and I can figure out this and that. It's like, I'm just\n\n48:47.440 --> 48:52.640\n going to say, what's the average density of molecules? And so, one key feature of us is that\n\n48:52.640 --> 48:57.920\n we are computationally bounded. And that when you are looking at a universe which is full of\n\n48:57.920 --> 49:03.920\n computation and doing huge amounts of computation, but we are computationally bounded, there's only\n\n49:03.920 --> 49:08.240\n certain things about that universe that we're going to be sensitive to. We're not going to be,\n\n49:08.240 --> 49:13.040\n you know, figuring out what all the atoms of space are doing, because we're just computationally\n\n49:13.040 --> 49:19.920\n bounded observers, and we are only sampling these small set of features. So, I think the\n\n49:19.920 --> 49:25.040\n two defining features of consciousness that, and I, you know, I would say that the sort of the\n\n49:25.040 --> 49:30.480\n preamble to this is, for years, you know, as I've talked about sort of computation and fundamental\n\n49:30.480 --> 49:36.800\n features of physics and science, people ask me, so what about consciousness? And I, for years,\n\n49:36.800 --> 49:40.480\n I've said, I have nothing to say about consciousness. And, you know, I've kind of\n\n49:40.480 --> 49:45.040\n told this story, you know, you talk about intelligence, you talk about life. These are\n\n49:45.040 --> 49:49.200\n both features where you say, what's the abstract definition of life? We don't really know the\n\n49:49.200 --> 49:53.680\n abstract definition. We know the one for life on Earth, it's got RNA, it's got cell membranes,\n\n49:53.680 --> 49:58.480\n it's got all this kind of stuff. Similarly for intelligence, we know the human definition of\n\n49:58.480 --> 50:03.600\n intelligence, but what is intelligence abstractly? We don't really know. And so, what I've long\n\n50:03.600 --> 50:09.440\n believed is that sort of the abstract definition of intelligence is just computational sophistication.\n\n50:09.440 --> 50:14.880\n That is, that as soon as you can be computationally sophisticated, that's kind of the abstract\n\n50:14.880 --> 50:20.080\n version, the generalized version of intelligence. So, then the question is, what about consciousness?\n\n50:20.080 --> 50:26.000\n And what I sort of realized is that consciousness is actually a step down from intelligence. That\n\n50:26.000 --> 50:32.800\n is, that you might think, oh, you know, consciousness is the top of the pie, but it's\n\n50:32.800 --> 50:37.440\n the top of the pile. But actually, I don't think it is. I think that there's this notion of kind\n\n50:37.440 --> 50:42.560\n of computational sophistication, which is the generalized intelligence. But consciousness\n\n50:42.560 --> 50:47.760\n has two limitations, I think. One of them is computational boundedness. That is, that we're\n\n50:47.760 --> 50:53.760\n only perceiving a sort of computationally bounded view of the universe. And the other is this idea\n\n50:53.760 --> 50:59.920\n of a single thread of time. That is, that we, and in fact, we know neurophysiologically our brains\n\n50:59.920 --> 51:05.760\n go to some trouble to give us this one thread of attention, so to speak. And it isn't the case that\n\n51:05.760 --> 51:12.640\n in all the neurons in our brains that, at least in our conscious, the correspondence of language,\n\n51:12.640 --> 51:17.280\n in our conscious experience, we just have the single thread of attention, single thread of\n\n51:17.920 --> 51:23.680\n perception. And maybe there's something unconscious that's bubbling around that's the kind of\n\n51:23.680 --> 51:28.160\n almost the quantum version of what's happening in our brain, so to speak. We've got the classical\n\n51:28.160 --> 51:33.600\n flow of what we are mostly thinking about, so to speak. But there's this kind of bubbling around\n\n51:33.600 --> 51:38.800\n of other paths that is all those other neurons that didn't make it to be part of our sort of\n\n51:38.800 --> 51:44.560\n conscious stream of experience. So in that sense, intelligence as computational sophistication is\n\n51:44.560 --> 51:54.240\n much broader than the computational constraints which consciousness operates under, and also the\n\n51:54.240 --> 51:59.920\n sequential, like the sequential thing, like the notion of time. That's kind of interesting. But\n\n51:59.920 --> 52:05.360\n then the follow up question is like, okay, starting to get a sense of what is intelligence, and how\n\n52:05.360 --> 52:12.720\n does that connect to our human brain? Because you're saying intelligence is almost like a fabric,\n\n52:12.720 --> 52:18.240\n like what we like plug into it or something, like our consciousness plugs into it.\n\n52:18.240 --> 52:23.520\n Yeah, I mean, the intelligence, I think the core, I mean, you know, intelligence at some\n\n52:23.520 --> 52:28.880\n level is just a word, but we are asking, you know, what is the notion of intelligence as we\n\n52:28.880 --> 52:33.760\n generalize it beyond the bounds of humans, beyond the bounds of even the AIs that we humans have\n\n52:33.760 --> 52:39.600\n built and so on? You know, what is intelligence? You know, is the weather, you know, people say the\n\n52:39.600 --> 52:43.200\n weather has a mind of its own. What does that mean? You know, can the weather be intelligent?\n\n52:43.840 --> 52:48.320\n Yeah. What does agency have to do with intelligence here? So is intelligence just\n\n52:48.320 --> 52:54.640\n like your conception of computation, just intelligence is the capacity to perform\n\n52:54.640 --> 52:59.840\n computation and the sea of? Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think that's right. And I think that,\n\n52:59.840 --> 53:07.120\n you know, this question of, is it for a purpose? Okay, that quickly degenerates into a horrible\n\n53:07.120 --> 53:12.800\n philosophical mess. Because, you know, whenever you say, did the weather do that for a purpose?\n\n53:12.800 --> 53:17.440\n Yeah. Right? Well, yes, it did. It was trying to move a bunch of hot air from the equator to the\n\n53:17.440 --> 53:23.760\n poles or something. That's its purpose. But why? Because I seem to be equally as dumb today as I\n\n53:23.760 --> 53:30.880\n was yesterday. So there's some persistence, like a consistency over time that the intelligence\n\n53:30.880 --> 53:37.280\n I plugged into. So like, what's, it seems like there's a hard constraint between the amount of\n\n53:37.280 --> 53:42.720\n computation I can perform in my consciousness. Like they seem to be really closely connected\n\n53:42.720 --> 53:48.720\n somehow. Well, I think the point is that the thing that gives you kind of the ability to have\n\n53:48.720 --> 53:56.400\n kind of conscious intelligence, you can have kind of this, okay, so one thing is we don't know\n\n53:57.040 --> 54:02.880\n intelligences other than the ones that are very much like us. Yes. Right. And the ones that are\n\n54:02.880 --> 54:07.680\n very much like us, I think have this feature of single thread of time, bounded, you know,\n\n54:07.680 --> 54:14.000\n computationally bounded. But you also need computational sophistication. Having a single\n\n54:14.000 --> 54:19.920\n thread of time and being computationally bounded, you could just be a clock going tick tock. That\n\n54:19.920 --> 54:27.840\n would satisfy those conditions. But the fact that we have this sort of irreducible computational\n\n54:27.840 --> 54:34.640\n ability, that's an important feature. That's sort of the bedrock on which we can construct\n\n54:34.640 --> 54:40.800\n the things we construct. Now, the fact that we have this experience of the world that has the\n\n54:40.800 --> 54:47.120\n single thread of time and computational boundedness, the thing that I sort of realized is it's that\n\n54:47.120 --> 54:52.800\n that causes us to deduce from this irreducible mess of what's going on in the physical world,\n\n54:53.440 --> 55:00.720\n the laws of physics that we think exist. So in other words, if we say, why do we believe that\n\n55:00.720 --> 55:06.480\n there is, you know, continuous space, let's say, why do we believe that gravity works the way it\n\n55:06.480 --> 55:14.560\n does? Well, in principle, we could be kind of parsing details of the universe that were, you\n\n55:14.560 --> 55:22.560\n know, that OK, the analogy is, again, with the statistical mechanics and molecules in a box,\n\n55:22.560 --> 55:27.120\n we could be sensitive to every little detail of the swirling around of those molecules. And we\n\n55:27.120 --> 55:33.200\n could say what really matters is the, you know, the wiggle effect that is, you know, that is\n\n55:33.200 --> 55:37.440\n something that we humans just never noticed because it's some weird thing that happens when\n\n55:37.440 --> 55:42.720\n there are 15 collisions of air molecules and this happens and that happens. We just see the pure\n\n55:42.720 --> 55:49.600\n motion of a ball moving about. Right. Why do we see that? Right. And the point is that that what\n\n55:49.600 --> 55:55.280\n seems to be the case is that the things that if we say, given this sort of hypergraph that's\n\n55:55.280 --> 56:00.640\n updating and all the details about all the sort of atoms of space and what they do, and we say,\n\n56:00.640 --> 56:06.080\n how do we slice that to what we can be sensitive to? What seems to be the case is that as soon as\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:12.080\n we assume, you know, computational boundedness, single thread of time, that leads us to general\n\n56:12.080 --> 56:17.920\n relativity. In other words, we can't avoid that. That's the way that we will parse the universe.\n\n56:17.920 --> 56:24.720\n Given those constraints, we parse the universe according to those particular in such a way that\n\n56:24.720 --> 56:33.200\n we say the aggregate reducible sort of pocket of computational reducibility that we slice out of\n\n56:33.200 --> 56:38.880\n this kind of whole computational irreducible ocean of behavior is just this one that corresponds to\n\n56:38.880 --> 56:44.160\n general relativity. Yeah, but we don't perceive general relativity. Well, we do if we do fancy\n\n56:44.160 --> 56:49.600\n experiments. So you're saying so perceive really does mean the full. We drop something. That's a\n\n56:49.600 --> 56:54.080\n great example of general relativity in action. No, but like what's the difference in that and\n\n56:54.080 --> 56:58.720\n Newtonian mechanics? I mean, oh, it doesn't. This is when I say general relativity, that's\n\n57:00.000 --> 57:05.920\n the uber theory, so to speak. I mean, Newtonian gravity is just the approximation that we can make,\n\n57:05.920 --> 57:11.600\n you know, on the earth and things like that. So this is, you know, the phenomenon of gravity\n\n57:11.600 --> 57:17.040\n is one that is a consequence of, you know, we would perceive something very different from\n\n57:17.040 --> 57:26.160\n gravity. So so the way to understand that is when we think about OK, so we make up reference frames\n\n57:26.160 --> 57:31.120\n with which we parse what's happening in space and time. So in other words, one of the one of\n\n57:31.120 --> 57:40.240\n the things that we do is we say as time progresses everywhere in space is something happens at a\n\n57:40.240 --> 57:44.560\n particular time and then we go to the next time and we say this is what space is like at the next\n\n57:44.560 --> 57:50.720\n time is what space is like at the next time. That's it's the reason we are used to doing that\n\n57:51.280 --> 57:56.160\n is because, you know, when we look around, we might see, you know, ten hundred meters away.\n\n57:57.200 --> 58:02.320\n The time it takes light to travel that distance is really short compared to the time it takes our\n\n58:02.320 --> 58:08.320\n brains to know what happened. So as far as our brains are concerned, we are parsing the universe\n\n58:08.320 --> 58:12.640\n in this. There is a moment in time, it's all of space. There's a moment in time, it's all of\n\n58:12.640 --> 58:17.440\n space. If we were the size of planets or something, we would have a different perception because the\n\n58:17.440 --> 58:21.920\n speed of light would be much more important to us. We wouldn't have this perception that\n\n58:22.720 --> 58:28.160\n things happen progressively in time everywhere in space. And so that's an important kind of\n\n58:28.160 --> 58:33.760\n constraint. And the reason that we kind of parse the universe in the way that causes us to say\n\n58:33.760 --> 58:39.520\n gravity works the way it does is because we're doing things like deciding that we can say the\n\n58:39.520 --> 58:45.680\n universe exists, space has a definite structure. There is a moment in time, space has this definite\n\n58:45.680 --> 58:50.640\n structure. We move to the next moment in time, space has another structure. That kind of setup\n\n58:50.640 --> 58:58.000\n is what lets us kind of deduce kind of what parse the universe in such a way that we say gravity\n\n58:58.000 --> 59:05.280\n works the way it does. So that kind of reference frame is that the illusion of that is that you're\n\n59:05.280 --> 59:11.040\n saying that's somehow useful for consciousness. That's what consciousness does. Because in a\n\n59:11.040 --> 59:19.520\n sense, what consciousness is doing is it's insisting that the universe is kind of sequentialized.\n\n59:21.040 --> 59:25.520\n And it is not allowing the possibility that, oh, there are these multiple threads of time\n\n59:25.520 --> 59:31.760\n and they're all flowing differently. It's like saying, no, everything is happening in this one\n\n59:31.760 --> 59:36.160\n thread of experience that we have. And that illusion of that one thread of experience\n\n59:36.160 --> 59:41.760\n cannot happen at the planetary scale. Are you saying typical human, are you saying we are at a\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:49.280\n human level is special here for consciousness? Well, for our kind of consciousness, if we existed\n\n59:49.280 --> 59:53.600\n at a scale close to the elementary length, for example, then our perception of the universe\n\n59:53.600 --> 59:58.720\n will be absurdly different. Okay. But this makes consciousness seem like a weird side effect to\n\n59:58.720 --> 1:00:04.080\n this particular scale. And so who cares? I mean, consciousness is not that special.\n\n1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:09.520\n Look, I think that a very interesting question is, which I've certainly thought a little bit about,\n\n1:00:10.160 --> 1:00:16.000\n is what can you imagine? What is a sort of factoring of something? What are some other\n\n1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:23.840\n possible ways you could exist, so to speak? And if you were a photon, if you were some kind of thing\n\n1:00:23.840 --> 1:00:30.480\n that was kind of, you know, intelligence represented in terms of photons, you know,\n\n1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:35.280\n for example, the photons we receive in the cosmic microwave background, those photons,\n\n1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:39.520\n as far as they're concerned, the universe just started. They were emitted, you know,\n\n1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:43.200\n 100,000 years after the beginning of the universe, they've been traveling at the speed of light,\n\n1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:49.280\n time stayed still for them, and then they just arrived and we just detected them. So for them,\n\n1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.920\n the universe just started. And that's a different perception of, you know, that has\n\n1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:57.760\n implications for a very different perception of time. They don't have that single thread\n\n1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:01.840\n that seems to be really important for being able to tell a heck of a good story.\n\n1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:07.920\n So we humans, we can tell a story. Right. We can tell a story. What other kind of stories can you\n\n1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:13.040\n tell? So photon is a really boring story. Yeah. I mean, so that's a, I don't know if they're a\n\n1:01:13.040 --> 1:01:17.760\n boring story, but I think it's, you know, I've been wondering about this and I've been asking,\n\n1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:20.960\n you know, friends of mine who are science fiction writers and things, have you written stuff about\n\n1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:28.240\n this? And I've got one example, a great collection of books from my friend Rudy Rooker, which I have\n\n1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:34.640\n to say, they're books that are very informed by a bunch of science that I've done. And the thing\n\n1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:41.360\n that I really loved about them is, you know, in the first chapter of the book, the Earth is consumed\n\n1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:47.920\n by these things called nants, which are nano, nanobot type things. So, you know, so the Earth\n\n1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:53.760\n is gone in the first, but then it comes back. But then, yeah, right. That was only a micro\n\n1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:01.600\n spoiler. It's only chapter one. But the thing that is not a real spoiler alert because it's\n\n1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:07.920\n such a complicated concept, but in the end, the Earth is saved by this thing called the\n\n1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:12.640\n principle of computational equivalence, which is a kind of a core scientific idea of mine.\n\n1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:17.760\n And I was just like, like thrilled. I don't read fiction books very often. And I was just thrilled.\n\n1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:22.480\n I get to the end of this and it's like, oh, my gosh, you know, everything is saved by this sort\n\n1:02:22.480 --> 1:02:27.920\n of deep scientific principle. Can you maybe elaborate how the principle of computational\n\n1:02:27.920 --> 1:02:36.240\n equivalence can save a planet? That would, that would be a terrible spoiler. That would be a\n\n1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:42.720\n spoiler. But no, but let me say what the principle of computational equivalence is. So the question\n\n1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:48.800\n is, you are, you have a system, you have some rule, you can think of its behavior as corresponding\n\n1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:54.560\n to a computation. The question is, how sophisticated is that computation? The statement of the principle\n\n1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:00.640\n of computational equivalence is, as soon as it's not obviously simple, it will be as sophisticated\n\n1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:07.280\n as anything. And so that has the implication that, you know, rule 30, you know, our brains,\n\n1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:12.080\n other things in physics, they're all ultimately equivalent in the computations they can do.\n\n1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.480\n And that's what leads to this computational irreducibility idea because the reason we don't\n\n1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:22.080\n get to jump ahead, you know, and out think rule 30 is because we're just computationally equivalent\n\n1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:28.160\n to rule 30. So we're kind of just both just running computations that are the same sort of\n\n1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:34.320\n raw, the same level of computation, so to speak. So that's kind of the idea there. And the question,\n\n1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:41.200\n I mean, it's like the, you know, in the science fiction version would be, okay, somebody says,\n\n1:03:41.200 --> 1:03:46.640\n we just need more servers, get us more servers. The way to get even more servers is turn the\n\n1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:53.520\n whole planet into a bunch of microservers. And that's where it starts. And so the question of,\n\n1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:57.600\n you know, computational equivalence, principle of computational equivalence is, well, actually,\n\n1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:06.080\n you don't need to build those custom servers. Actually, you can just use natural computation\n\n1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:11.120\n to compute things, so to speak. You can use nature to compute. You don't need to have done\n\n1:04:11.120 --> 1:04:16.480\n all that engineering. I mean, it kind of feels a little disappointing that you say, we're going to\n\n1:04:16.480 --> 1:04:19.920\n build all these servers. We're going to do all these things. We're going to make, you know,\n\n1:04:19.920 --> 1:04:25.120\n maybe we're going to have human consciousness uploaded into, you know, some elaborate digital\n\n1:04:25.120 --> 1:04:29.520\n environment. And then you look at that thing and you say, it's got electrons moving around,\n\n1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:33.760\n just like in a rock. And then you say, well, what's the difference? And the principle of\n\n1:04:33.760 --> 1:04:39.920\n computational equivalence says there isn't, at some level, a fundamental, you know, you can't say,\n\n1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:45.440\n mathematically, there's a fundamental difference between the rock that is the future of human\n\n1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:51.120\n consciousness and the rock that's just a rock. Now, what I've sort of realized with this kind\n\n1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:59.200\n of consciousness thing is there is an aspect of this that seems to be more special. And for\n\n1:04:59.200 --> 1:05:03.920\n example, something I haven't really teased apart properly is when it comes to something like the\n\n1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:07.600\n weather and the weather having a mind of its own or whatever, or your average, you know,\n\n1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:13.520\n pulsar magnetosphere acting like a sort of intelligent thing, how does that relate to,\n\n1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:21.360\n you know, how is that entity related to the kind of consciousness that we have? And sort of,\n\n1:05:21.360 --> 1:05:25.920\n what would the world look like, you know, to the weather? If we think about the weather as a mind,\n\n1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:30.880\n what will it perceive? What will its laws of physics be? I don't really know.\n\n1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.280\n Because it's very parallel.\n\n1:05:33.280 --> 1:05:39.360\n It's very parallel, among other things. And it's not obvious. I mean, this is a really kind of\n\n1:05:39.360 --> 1:05:46.480\n mindbending thing because we've got to try and imagine a parsing of the universe different from\n\n1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:51.760\n the one we have. And by the way, when we think about extraterrestrial intelligence and so on,\n\n1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:57.040\n I think that's kind of the key thing is, you know, we've always assumed, I've always assumed,\n\n1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:01.680\n okay, the extraterrestrials, at least they have the same physics. We all live in the same universe.\n\n1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.200\n They've got the same physics. But actually, that's not really right because the extraterrestrials\n\n1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:12.960\n could have a completely different way of parsing the universe. So it's as if, you know, there could\n\n1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:17.680\n be for all we know, right here in this room, you know, in the details of the motion of these gas\n\n1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:24.800\n molecules, there could be an amazing intelligence that we were like, but we have no way of, we're\n\n1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:29.360\n not parsing the universe in the same way. If only we could parse the universe in the right way,\n\n1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:34.400\n you know, immediately this amazing thing that's going on and this, you know, huge culture that's\n\n1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:38.240\n developed and all that kind of thing would be obvious to us, but it's not because we have our\n\n1:06:38.240 --> 1:06:43.440\n particular way of parsing the universe. Would that thing also have an agency? I don't know the right\n\n1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:47.920\n word to use, but something like consciousness, but a different kind of consciousness?\n\n1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:51.360\n I think it's a question of just what you mean by the word, because I think that the,\n\n1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:56.480\n you know, this notion of consciousness and the, okay, so some people think of consciousness as\n\n1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:03.840\n sort of a key aspect of it is that we feel that there's sort of a feeling of that we exist in\n\n1:07:03.840 --> 1:07:11.040\n some way, that we have this intrinsic feeling about ourselves. You know, I suspect that any\n\n1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:14.720\n of these things would also have an intrinsic feeling about themselves. I've been sort of\n\n1:07:14.720 --> 1:07:19.680\n trying to think recently about constructing an experiment about what if you were just a piece\n\n1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:24.480\n of a cellular automaton, let's say, you know, what would your feeling about yourself actually be?\n\n1:07:25.120 --> 1:07:30.480\n And, you know, can we put ourselves in the shoes, in the cells of the cellular automaton,\n\n1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:36.640\n so to speak? Can we get ourselves close enough to that, that we could have a sense of what the\n\n1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:42.240\n world would be like if you were operating in that way? And it's a little difficult because,\n\n1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:46.880\n you know, you have to not only think about what are you perceiving, but also what's actually\n\n1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:52.560\n going on in your brain. And our brains do what they actually do. And they don't, it's, you know,\n\n1:07:52.560 --> 1:07:57.840\n I think there might be some experiments that are possible with neural nets and so on,\n\n1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:02.080\n where you can have something where you can at least see in detail what's happening inside the\n\n1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:10.320\n system. And one of my projects to think about is, is there a way of kind of getting a sense\n\n1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:16.160\n kind of from inside the system about what its view of the world is and how it, you know,\n\n1:08:16.960 --> 1:08:23.360\n can we make a bridge? See, the main issue is this. It's a sort of philosophically difficult thing\n\n1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:29.360\n because it's like we do what we do. We understand ourselves, at least to some extent.\n\n1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:30.800\n We humans understand ourselves.\n\n1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.920\n That's correct. But yet, okay, so what are we trying to do, for example, when we are trying to\n\n1:08:35.920 --> 1:08:40.160\n make a model of physics? What are we actually trying to do? Because, you know, you say, well,\n\n1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:44.320\n can we work out what the universe does? Well, of course we can. We just watch the universe. The\n\n1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.040\n universe does what it does. But what we're trying to do when we make a model of physics is we're\n\n1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:54.880\n trying to get to the point where we can tell a story to ourselves that we understand that is also\n\n1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:59.680\n a representation of what the universe does. So it's this kind of, you know, can we make a bridge\n\n1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:05.360\n between what we humans can understand in our minds and what the universe does? And in a sense,\n\n1:09:05.360 --> 1:09:11.600\n you know, a large part of my kind of life efforts have been devoted to making computational\n\n1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:16.720\n language, which kind of is a bridge between what is possible in the computational universe\n\n1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:22.640\n and what we humans can conceptualize and think about. In a sense, when I built Wolfram Language\n\n1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:28.560\n and our whole sort of computational language story, it's all about how do you take sort of raw\n\n1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:33.760\n computation and this ocean of computational possibility and how do we sort of represent\n\n1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:39.520\n pieces of it in a way that we humans can understand and that map onto things that we care about doing.\n\n1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:44.480\n And in a sense, when you add physics, you're adding this other piece where we can, you know,\n\n1:09:44.480 --> 1:09:50.560\n mediated by computer, can we get physics to the point where we humans can understand something\n\n1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:55.200\n about what's happening in it? And when we talk about an alien intelligence, it's kind of the\n\n1:09:55.200 --> 1:10:00.960\n same story. It's like, is there a way of mapping what's happening there onto something that we\n\n1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:08.800\n humans can understand? And, you know, physics in some sense is like our exhibit one of the story\n\n1:10:08.800 --> 1:10:15.600\n of alien intelligence. It's an alien intelligence in some sense. And what we're doing in making a\n\n1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:21.200\n model of physics is mapping that onto something that we understand. And I think, you know, a lot\n\n1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:26.320\n of these other things that I've recently been kind of studying, whether it's molecular biology,\n\n1:10:26.320 --> 1:10:33.760\n other kinds of things, which we can talk about a bit, those are other cases where we're in a sense\n\n1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:39.280\n trying to, again, make that bridge between what we humans understand and sort of the natural\n\n1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:43.280\n language of that sort of alien intelligence in some sense. When you're talking about,\n\n1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:51.840\n just to backtrack a little bit about cellular automata, being able to, what's it like to be\n\n1:10:51.840 --> 1:10:58.560\n a cellular automata in the way that's equivalent to what is it like to be a conscious human being?\n\n1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:04.240\n How do you approach that? So is it looking at some subset of the cellular automata, asking questions\n\n1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:13.920\n of that subset, like how the world is perceived, how you as that subset, like for that local pocket\n\n1:11:13.920 --> 1:11:20.320\n of computation, what are you able to say about the broader cellular time? And that somehow then\n\n1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:25.760\n can give you a sense of how to step outside of that cellular time. Right, but the tricky part is\n\n1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:33.440\n that that little subset, what it's doing is it has a view of itself. And the question is,\n\n1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:40.320\n how do you get inside it? It's like when we, with humans, it's like we can't get inside each other's\n\n1:11:40.320 --> 1:11:47.360\n consciousness. That doesn't really even make sense. It's like there is an experience that\n\n1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.640\n somebody is having, but you can perceive things from the outside, but sort of getting inside\n\n1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:58.160\n it, it doesn't quite make sense. And for me, these sort of philosophical issues, and this one I have\n\n1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:04.640\n not untangled, so let's be... For me, the thing that has been really interesting in thinking\n\n1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:09.760\n through some of these things is when it comes to questions about consciousness or whatever else,\n\n1:12:09.760 --> 1:12:16.400\n it's like when I can run a program and actually see pictures and make things concrete, I have a\n\n1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:20.160\n much better chance to understand what's going on than when I'm just trying to figure out what's\n\n1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:24.240\n going on. I have a much better chance to understand what's going on than when I'm just trying to\n\n1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:32.800\n reason about things in a very abstract way. Yeah, but there may be a way to map the program to your\n\n1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:37.120\n conscious experience. So for example, when you play a video game, you do a first person shooter,\n\n1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:43.920\n you walk around inside this entity. It's a very different thing than watching this entity. So\n\n1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:51.120\n connect more and more, connect this full conscious experience to the subset of the cellular automata.\n\n1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:55.280\n Yeah, it's something like that. But the difference in the first person shooter thing is there's still\n\n1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:02.960\n your brain and your memory is still remembering. You still have... It's hard to... I mean, again,\n\n1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:08.000\n what one's going to get, one is not going to actually be able to be the cellular automaton.\n\n1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:12.080\n One's going to be able to watch what the cellular automaton does. But this is the frustrating thing\n\n1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:18.080\n that I'm trying to understand how to think about being it, so to speak.\n\n1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:21.920\n Okay. So like in virtual reality, there's a concept of immersion, like with anything,\n\n1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:26.880\n with video games, with books, there's a concept of immersion. It feels like over time, if the\n\n1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:32.880\n virtual reality experience is well done, and maybe in the future it'll be extremely well done,\n\n1:13:33.680 --> 1:13:40.960\n the immersion leads you to feel like... You mentioned memories. You forget that you even\n\n1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:46.480\n ever existed outside that experience. It's so immersive. I mean, you could argue sort of\n\n1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:52.880\n mathematically that you can never truly become immersed, but maybe you can. I mean, why can't you\n\n1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:58.400\n merge with the cellular automata? I mean, aren't you just part of the same fabric? Why can't you\n\n1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.960\n just like... Well, that's a good question. I mean, so let's imagine the following scenario. Let's\n\n1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:08.400\n imagine... Can you return? But then can you return back? Well, yeah, right. I mean, it's like,\n\n1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:14.320\n let's imagine you've uploaded, your brain is scanned, you've got every synapse mapped out,\n\n1:14:14.320 --> 1:14:18.960\n you upload everything about you, the brain simulator, you upload the brain simulator,\n\n1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:25.040\n and the brain simulator is basically some glorified cellular automaton. And then you say,\n\n1:14:25.040 --> 1:14:28.560\n well, now we've got an answer to what does it feel like to be a cellular automaton?\n\n1:14:28.560 --> 1:14:34.480\n It feels just like it felt to be ordinary you, because they're both computational systems,\n\n1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:39.760\n and they're both operating in the same way. But I think there's somehow more to it,\n\n1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:46.000\n because in that sense, when you're just making a brain simulator, we're just saying there's\n\n1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:50.960\n another version of our consciousness. The question that we're asking is, if we tease away from our\n\n1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:55.840\n consciousness and get to something that is different, how do we make a bridge to understanding\n\n1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:00.880\n what's going on there? And there's a way of thinking about this. Okay, so this is coming\n\n1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:05.440\n on to questions about the existence of the universe and so on. But one of the things is\n\n1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:11.600\n there's this notion that we have of ruleal space. So we have this idea of this physical space,\n\n1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.200\n which is something you can move around in that's associated with the extent of the\n\n1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:22.480\n spatial hypergraph. Then there's what we call branchial space, the space of quantum branches.\n\n1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:28.000\n So in this thing we call the multiway graph of all of this branching histories,\n\n1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.560\n there's this idea of a kind of space where instead of moving around in physical space,\n\n1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:36.560\n you're moving from history to history, so to speak, from one possible history to another\n\n1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:42.160\n possible history. And that's kind of a different kind of space that is the space in which quantum\n\n1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:48.960\n mechanics plays out. Quantum mechanics, for example, I think we're slowly understanding\n\n1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:53.600\n things like destructive interference in quantum mechanics, that what's happening is branchial\n\n1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:58.080\n space is associated with phase in quantum mechanics. And what's happening is the two\n\n1:15:58.080 --> 1:16:02.480\n photons that are supposed to be interfering and destructively interfering are winding up at\n\n1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:09.200\n different ends of branchial space. And so us as these poor observers that have branching brains\n\n1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:13.440\n that are trying to conflate together these different threads of history and say,\n\n1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:17.040\n we've really got a consistent story that we're telling here. We're really knitting together\n\n1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:22.000\n these threads of history. By the time the two photons wound up at opposite ends of branchial\n\n1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:26.880\n space, we just can't knit them together to tell a consistent story. So for us,\n\n1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:30.800\n that's sort of the analog of destructive interference. Got it. And then there's\n\n1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:37.520\n rule space too, which is the space of rules. Yes. Well, that's another level up. So there's\n\n1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:42.240\n the question. Actually, I do want to mention one thing because it's something I've realized in\n\n1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:46.640\n recent times and I think it's really, really kind of cool, which is about time dilation and\n\n1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:51.520\n relativity. And it kind of helps to understand it's something that kind of helps in understanding\n\n1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:58.240\n what's going on. So according to relativity, if you have a clock, it's ticking at a certain rate,\n\n1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:03.040\n you send it in a spacecraft that's going at some significant fraction of the speed of light,\n\n1:17:03.600 --> 1:17:09.920\n to you as an observer at rest, that clock that's in the spacecraft will seem to be ticking much\n\n1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:16.720\n more slowly. And so in other words, it's kind of like the twin who goes off to Alpha Centauri and\n\n1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:22.640\n goes very fast will age much less than the twin who's on Earth that is just hanging out where\n\n1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:27.920\n they're hanging out. Okay, why does that happen? Okay, so it has to do with what motion is.\n\n1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:34.400\n So in our models of physics, what is motion? Well, when you move from somewhere to somewhere,\n\n1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:39.600\n you're having to sort of recreate yourself at a different place in space.\n\n1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:46.080\n When you exist at a particular place and you just evolve with time, again, you're updating yourself,\n\n1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:51.200\n you're following these rules to update what happens. Well, so the question is, when you\n\n1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:55.440\n have a certain amount of computation in you, so to speak, when there's a certain amount,\n\n1:17:55.440 --> 1:17:59.520\n you know, you're computing, the universe is computing at a certain rate, you can either\n\n1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:05.360\n use that computation to work out sitting still where you are, what's going to happen successively\n\n1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.480\n in time, or you can use that computation to recreate yourself as you move around the universe.\n\n1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:16.000\n Mm hmm. And so time dilation ends up being, it's really cool, actually, that this is explainable\n\n1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.920\n in a way that isn't just imagine the mathematics of relativity. But time dilation is a story of\n\n1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:27.840\n the fact that as you kind of are recreating yourself as you move, you are using up some\n\n1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:33.120\n of your computation. And so you don't have as much computation left over to actually work out what\n\n1:18:33.120 --> 1:18:38.880\n happens progressively with time. So that means that time is running more slowly for you because\n\n1:18:38.880 --> 1:18:45.600\n it is, you're using up your computation, your clock can't tick as quickly, because every tick\n\n1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.160\n of the clock is using up some computation, but you already use that computation up on moving at,\n\n1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:54.800\n you know, half the speed of light or something. And so that's why time dilation happens.\n\n1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.560\n And so you can start, so it's kind of interesting that one can sort of get an intuition about\n\n1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:05.520\n something like that, because it has seemed like just a mathematical fact about the mathematics of\n\n1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:10.560\n special relativity and so on. Well, for me, it's a little bit confusing what the you in that picture\n\n1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:19.840\n is, because you're using up computation. Okay, so we're simply saying the entity is updating\n\n1:19:19.840 --> 1:19:26.800\n itself according to the way that the universe updates itself. And the question is, you know,\n\n1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:31.680\n those updates, let's imagine the you as a clock. Okay. And the clock is, you know, there's all\n\n1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:37.120\n these little updates, the hypergraph and a sequence of updates cause the pendulum to swing back the\n\n1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:44.240\n other way, and then swing back, swinging back and forth. Okay. And all of those updates are\n\n1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:48.240\n contributing to the motion of, you know, the pendulum going back and forth or the little\n\n1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:54.480\n oscillator moving, whatever it is. Okay. But then the alternative is that sort of situation one,\n\n1:19:54.480 --> 1:20:00.880\n where the thing is at rest, situation two, where it's kind of moving, what's happening is it is\n\n1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:07.520\n having to recreate itself at every moment, the thing is going to have to do the computations\n\n1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:12.480\n to be able to sort of recreate itself at a different position in space. And that's kind of\n\n1:20:12.480 --> 1:20:17.760\n the intuition behind, so it's either going to spend its computation recreating itself at a\n\n1:20:17.760 --> 1:20:24.240\n different position in space, or it's going to spend its computation doing the sort of doing the\n\n1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:30.240\n updating of the, you know, of the ticking of the clock, so to speak. So the more updating is doing,\n\n1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:35.120\n the less the ticking of the clock update is doing. That's right. The more it's having to update\n\n1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:42.640\n because of motion, the less it can update the clock. Obviously, there's a sort of mathematical\n\n1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:47.200\n version of it that relates to how it actually works in relativity, but that's kind of, to me,\n\n1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:52.560\n that was sort of exciting to me that it's possible to have a really mechanically explainable story\n\n1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:58.320\n there. And similarly in quantum mechanics, this notion of branching brains perceiving branching\n\n1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:03.200\n universes, to me, that's getting towards a sort of mechanically explainable version of what happens\n\n1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:07.920\n in quantum mechanics, even though it's a little bit mind bending to see, you know, these things\n\n1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:13.840\n about under what circumstances can you successfully knit together those different threads of history,\n\n1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:21.040\n and when do things sort of escape, and those kinds of things. But the thing about this physical space\n\n1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:26.960\n and physical space, the main sort of big theory is general relativity, the theory of gravity,\n\n1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:32.240\n and that tells you how things move in physical space. In branchial space, the big theory is the\n\n1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:38.320\n Feynman path integral, which it turns out tells you essentially how things move in quantum in the\n\n1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:43.840\n space of quantum phases. So it's kind of like motion in branchial space. And it's kind of a\n\n1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:51.280\n fun thing to start thinking about all these things that we know in physical space, like event horizons\n\n1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:55.440\n and black holes and so on. What are the analogous things in branchial space? For example, the speed\n\n1:21:55.440 --> 1:21:59.840\n of light, what's the analog of the speed of light in branchial space? It's the maximum speed of\n\n1:21:59.840 --> 1:22:06.720\n quantum entanglement. So the speed of light is a flash bulb goes off here. What's the maximum rate\n\n1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:13.280\n at which the effect of that flash bulb is detectable moving away in space? So similarly,\n\n1:22:13.280 --> 1:22:18.400\n in branchial space, something happens. And the question is, how far in this branchial space,\n\n1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:23.760\n in the space of quantum states, how far away can that get within a certain period of time?\n\n1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:28.720\n And so there's this notion of a maximum entanglement speed. And that might be observable.\n\n1:22:28.720 --> 1:22:32.800\n That's the thing we've been sort of poking at, is might there be a way to observe it,\n\n1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:37.920\n even in some atomic physics kind of situation? Because one of the things that's weird in\n\n1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:44.160\n quantum mechanics is when we study quantum mechanics, we mostly study it in terms of small\n\n1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:49.200\n numbers of particles. This electron does this, this thing on an ion trap does that and so on.\n\n1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:52.880\n But when we deal with large numbers of particles, kind of all bets are off. It's kind of too\n\n1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:58.480\n complicated to deal with quantum mechanics. And so what ends up happening is, so this question\n\n1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:04.320\n about maximum entanglement speed and things like that may actually play in the sort of story of\n\n1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:10.320\n many body quantum mechanics and even have some suspicions about things that might happen even in\n\n1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:15.840\n one of the things I realized I'd never understood and it's kind of embarrassing, but I think I now\n\n1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.480\n understand a little better, is when you have chemistry and you have quantum mechanics,\n\n1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:25.040\n it's like, well, there's two carbon atoms in this molecule and we do a reaction and we draw a\n\n1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:29.280\n diagram and we say this carbon atom ends up in this place. And it's like, but wait a minute,\n\n1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:32.800\n in quantum mechanics, nothing ends up in a definite place. There's always just some wave\n\n1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:37.600\n function for this to happen. How can it be the case that we can draw these reasonable, it just\n\n1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:42.000\n ended up in this place? And you have to kind of say, well, the environment of the molecule\n\n1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.640\n effectively made a bunch of measurements on the molecule to keep it kind of classical.\n\n1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:52.960\n And that's a story that has to do with this whole thing about measurements have to do with this\n\n1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:58.400\n idea of, can we conclude that something definite happened? Because in quantum mechanics,\n\n1:23:58.400 --> 1:24:02.400\n the intrinsic quantum mechanics, the mathematics of quantum mechanics is all about,\n\n1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:06.320\n they're just these amplitudes for different things to happen. Then there's this thing of,\n\n1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:11.040\n and then we make a measurement and we conclude that something definite happened. And that has\n\n1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:16.000\n to do with this thing, I think, about sort of moving about knitting together these different\n\n1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:20.320\n threads of history and saying, this is now something where we can definitively say something\n\n1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:25.680\n definite happened. In the traditional theory of quantum mechanics, it's just like, after you've\n\n1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:30.560\n done all this amplitude computation, then this big hammer comes down and you do a measurement\n\n1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.640\n and it's all over. And that's been very confusing. For example, in quantum computing,\n\n1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:39.680\n it's been a very confusing thing because when you say, in quantum computing, the basic idea is\n\n1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:44.080\n you're going to use all these separate threads of computation, so to speak, to do all the different\n\n1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:48.560\n parts of, try these different factors for an integer or something like this. And it looks\n\n1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:53.680\n like you can do a lot because you've got all these different threads going on. But then you have to\n\n1:24:53.680 --> 1:24:57.760\n say, well, at the end of it, you've got all these threads and every thread came up with a definite\n\n1:24:57.760 --> 1:25:02.960\n answer, but we got to conflate those together to figure out a definite thing that we humans\n\n1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.720\n can take away from it, a definite, so the computer actually produced this output.\n\n1:25:06.720 --> 1:25:14.640\n So having this branchial space and this hypergraph model of physics, do you think it's possible to\n\n1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:20.800\n then make predictions that are definite about many body quantum mechanical systems?\n\n1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:28.800\n I think it's likely, yes. Every one of these things, when you go from the underlying theory,\n\n1:25:28.800 --> 1:25:33.520\n which is complicated enough and it's, I mean, the theory at some level is beautifully simple,\n\n1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.680\n but as soon as you start actually trying to, it's this whole question about how do you bridge it to\n\n1:25:37.680 --> 1:25:43.440\n things that we humans can talk about, it gets really complicated. And this thing about actually\n\n1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:50.320\n getting it to a definite prediction about definite thing you can say about chemistry or something\n\n1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:54.560\n like this, that's just a lot of work. So I'll give you an example. There's a thing called the\n\n1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:01.680\n quantum Zeno effect. So the idea is quantum stuff happens, but then if you make a measurement,\n\n1:26:01.680 --> 1:26:08.000\n you're kind of freezing time in quantum mechanics. So it looks like there's a possibility that with\n\n1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:12.240\n sort of the relationship between the quantum Zeno effect and the way that many body quantum\n\n1:26:12.240 --> 1:26:18.240\n mechanics works and so on, maybe just conceivably, it may be possible to actually figure out a way\n\n1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:23.920\n to measure the maximum entanglement speed. And the reason we can potentially do that\n\n1:26:23.920 --> 1:26:29.360\n is because the systems we deal with in terms of atoms and things, they're pretty big. A mole of\n\n1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:37.520\n atoms is a lot of atoms, but it's something where to get, when we're dealing with how can you see\n\n1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:45.120\n 10 to the minus 100, so to speak? Well, by the time you've got 10 to the 30th atoms, you're within\n\n1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:51.760\n a little bit closer striking distance of that. It's not like, oh, we've just got two atoms and\n\n1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:56.800\n we're trying to see down to 10 to the minus 100 meters or whatever. So I don't know how it will\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:27:02.640\n work, but this is a potential direction. And if you can tell, by the way, if we could measure\n\n1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:07.120\n the maximum entanglement speed, we would know the elementary length. These are all related.\n\n1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:12.560\n So if we get that one number, we just need one number. If we can get that one number,\n\n1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:20.240\n the theory has no parameters anymore. And there are other places, well, there's another hope for\n\n1:27:20.240 --> 1:27:25.680\n doing that is in cosmology. In this model, one of the features is the universe is not fixed\n\n1:27:25.680 --> 1:27:29.920\n dimensional. We think we live in three dimensional space, but this hypergraph doesn't have any\n\n1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:36.320\n particular dimension. It can emerge as something which on an approximation, it's as if you say,\n\n1:27:36.320 --> 1:27:41.600\n what's the volume of a sphere in the hypergraph where a sphere is defined as how many nodes do\n\n1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:47.040\n you get to when you go a distance R away from a given point? And you can say, well, if I get to\n\n1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:52.960\n about R cubed nodes, when I go a distance R away in the hypergraph, then I'm living roughly in\n\n1:27:52.960 --> 1:28:02.800\n three dimensional space. But you might also get to R to the point 2.92 for some value of R. As R\n\n1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:07.920\n increases, that might be the sort of fit to what happens. And so one of the things we suspect is\n\n1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:12.560\n that the very early universe was essentially infinite dimensional, and that as the universe\n\n1:28:13.120 --> 1:28:19.680\n expanded, it became lower dimensional. And so one of the things that is another little sort of point\n\n1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:24.320\n where we think there might be a way to actually measure some things is dimension fluctuations in\n\n1:28:24.320 --> 1:28:30.720\n the early universe. That is, is there leftover dimension fluctuation of at the time of the cosmic\n\n1:28:30.720 --> 1:28:34.880\n microwave background, 100,000 years or something after the beginning of the universe? Is it still\n\n1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:39.840\n the case that there were pieces of the universe that didn't have dimension three, that had\n\n1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:47.920\n dimension 3.01 or something? And can we tell that? Is that possible to observe fluctuations in\n\n1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:54.240\n dimensions? I don't even know what that entails. Okay. So the question, which should be an\n\n1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:59.920\n elementary exercise in electrodynamics, except it isn't, is understanding what happens to a\n\n1:28:59.920 --> 1:29:05.680\n photon when it propagates through 3.01 dimensional space. So for example, the inverse square law\n\n1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:13.920\n is a consequence of the surface area of a sphere is proportional to R squared. But if you're not\n\n1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:19.280\n in three dimensional space, the surface area of sphere is not proportional to R squared. It's R\n\n1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:27.040\n to the whatever 2.01 or something. And so that means that I think when you kind of try and do\n\n1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:32.960\n optics, you know, a common principle in optics is Huygens principle, which basically says that every\n\n1:29:32.960 --> 1:29:40.560\n piece of a wave front of light is a source of new spherical waves. And those spherical waves,\n\n1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:46.080\n if they're different dimensional spherical waves, will have other characteristics. And so there will\n\n1:29:46.080 --> 1:29:53.680\n be bizarre optical phenomena which we haven't figured out yet. So you're looking for some weird\n\n1:29:53.680 --> 1:30:01.360\n photon trajectories that designate that it's 3.01 dimensional space? Yeah. Yeah. That would be an\n\n1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:05.200\n example of, I mean, you know, there are only a certain number of things we can measure about\n\n1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:09.360\n photons. You know, we can measure their polarization, we can measure their frequency,\n\n1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:15.360\n we can measure their direction, those kinds of things. And, you know, how that all works out.\n\n1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:21.360\n And, you know, in the current models of physics, you know, it's been hard to explain how the\n\n1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:26.240\n universe manages to be as uniform as it is. And that's led to this inflation idea that,\n\n1:30:26.880 --> 1:30:32.560\n to the great annoyance of my then collaborator, we figured out in like 1979, we had this\n\n1:30:32.560 --> 1:30:36.880\n realization that you could get something like this. But it seemed implausible that that's the\n\n1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:43.280\n way the universe worked. So we put it in a footnote. But in any case, I've never really\n\n1:30:43.280 --> 1:30:48.880\n completely believed it. But that's an idea for how to sort of puff out the universe faster than the\n\n1:30:48.880 --> 1:30:54.480\n speed of light, early moments of the universe. That's the sort of the inflation idea and that\n\n1:30:54.480 --> 1:31:01.600\n you can somehow explain how the universe manages to be as uniform as it is. In our model, this turns\n\n1:31:01.600 --> 1:31:07.040\n out to be much more natural because the universe just starts very connected. The hypergraph is not\n\n1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:12.320\n such that the ball that you grow starting from a single point has volume R cubed, it might have\n\n1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:19.600\n volume R to the 500 or R to the infinity. And so that means that you sort of naturally get this\n\n1:31:19.600 --> 1:31:23.680\n much higher degree of connectivity and uniformity in the universe. And then the question is,\n\n1:31:24.400 --> 1:31:29.040\n this is sort of the mathematical physics challenge, is in the standard theory of the universe,\n\n1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:33.360\n there's the Friedman Robertson Walker universe, which is the kind of standard model where the\n\n1:31:33.360 --> 1:31:38.560\n universe is isotropic and homogeneous. And you can then work out the equations of general relativity,\n\n1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.640\n and you can figure out how the universe expands. We would like to do the same kind of thing,\n\n1:31:42.640 --> 1:31:47.280\n including dimension change. This is just difficult mathematical physics. I mean,\n\n1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:51.360\n the reason it's difficult is the sort of fundamental reason it's difficult. When\n\n1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:58.240\n people invented calculus 300 years ago, calculus was a story of understanding change and change\n\n1:31:58.240 --> 1:32:03.120\n as a function of a variable. So people study univariate calculus, they study multivariate\n\n1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:08.320\n calculus, it's one variable, it's two variables, three variables. But whoever studied, you know,\n\n1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:16.320\n 2.5 variable calculus, turns out nobody. Turns out that what we need to have to understand these\n\n1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:23.280\n fractional dimensional spaces, which don't work like well, they're spaces where the effective\n\n1:32:23.280 --> 1:32:30.080\n dimension is not an integer. So you can't apply the tools of calculus naturally and easily to\n\n1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:34.480\n fractional dimensions? No. So somebody has to figure out how to do that. Yeah,\n\n1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:39.120\n we're trying to figure this out. I mean, it's very interesting. I mean, it's very connected to\n\n1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:44.560\n very frontier issues in mathematics. It's very beautiful. So is it possible? Is it possible?\n\n1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:51.040\n We're dealing with a scale that's so, so much smaller than our human scale. Is it possible\n\n1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:57.280\n to make predictions versus explanations? Do you have a hope that with this hypergraph model,\n\n1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:04.160\n you'd be able to make predictions that then could be validated with a physics experiment,\n\n1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:08.480\n predictions that couldn't have been done or weren't done otherwise? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean,\n\n1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:12.800\n you know, I think which, in which domain do you think? Okay, so they're going to be cosmology ones\n\n1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:16.720\n to do with dimension fluctuations in the universe. That's a very bizarre effect. Nobody, you know,\n\n1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:20.560\n dimension fluctuations is just something nobody ever looked for that. If anybody sees dimension\n\n1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:27.760\n fluctuation, that's a huge flag that something like our model is going on. And how one detects\n\n1:33:27.760 --> 1:33:32.240\n that, you know, that's a problem of kind of, you know, that's a problem of traditional physics in\n\n1:33:32.240 --> 1:33:37.600\n a sense of what's the best way to actually figure that out. And for example, that's one,\n\n1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:44.400\n there are all kinds of things one could imagine. I mean, there are things that in black hole mergers,\n\n1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:50.720\n it's possible that there will be effects of maximum entanglement speed in large black hole mergers.\n\n1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:55.680\n That's another possible thing. And all of that is detected through like what? Do you have a\n\n1:33:55.680 --> 1:34:01.040\n hope for LIGO type of situation? Like that's gravitational waves? Yeah. Or alternatively,\n\n1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:07.600\n I mean, I think it's, you know, look, figuring out experiments is like figuring out technology\n\n1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:12.640\n inventions. That is, you know, you've got a set of raw materials, you've got an underlying model,\n\n1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:16.800\n and now you've got to be very clever to figure out, you know, what is that thing I can measure\n\n1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:23.280\n that just somehow, you know, leverages into the right place. And we've spent less effort on that\n\n1:34:23.280 --> 1:34:30.320\n than I would have liked. Because one of the reasons is that I think that the physicists\n\n1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:35.360\n who've been working on our models, with now lots of physicists actually, it's very, very nice. It's\n\n1:34:35.360 --> 1:34:41.600\n kind of, it's one of these cases where I'm almost, I'm really kind of pleasantly surprised that the\n\n1:34:41.600 --> 1:34:47.760\n sort of absorption of the things we've done has been quite rapid and quite sort of, you know,\n\n1:34:47.760 --> 1:34:53.200\n very positive. So it's a Cambrian explosion of physicists too, not just ideas. Yes. I mean,\n\n1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:57.920\n you know, a lot of what's happened that's really interesting, and again, not what I expected,\n\n1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:04.160\n is there are a lot of areas of sort of very elaborate, sophisticated mathematical physics,\n\n1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.880\n whether that's causal set theory, whether it's higher category theory, whether it's categorical\n\n1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:13.600\n quantum mechanics, all sorts of elaborate names for these things, spin networks, perhaps,\n\n1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:20.160\n you know, causal dynamical triangulations, all kinds of names of these fields. And these fields\n\n1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:24.640\n have a bunch of good mathematical physicists in them who've been working for decades in these\n\n1:35:24.640 --> 1:35:30.640\n particular areas. And the question is, but they've been building these mathematical structures.\n\n1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:34.960\n And the mathematical structures are interesting, but they don't typically sit on anything.\n\n1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:39.920\n They're just mathematical structures. And I think what's happened is our models provide kind of\n\n1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:46.800\n a machine code that lives underneath those models. So a typical example, this is due to\n\n1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:52.960\n Jonathan Gorod, who's one of the key people who's been working on our project. This is in,\n\n1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:56.480\n okay, so I'll give you an example just to give a sense of how these things connect. This is in\n\n1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:03.520\n causal set theory. So the idea of causal set theory is there are, in spacetime, we imagine\n\n1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:09.040\n that there's space and time. It's a three plus one dimensional, you know, setup. We imagine that\n\n1:36:09.040 --> 1:36:16.160\n there are just events that happen at different times and places in space and time. And the idea\n\n1:36:16.160 --> 1:36:20.400\n of causal set theory is the only thing you say about the universe is there are a bunch of events\n\n1:36:20.400 --> 1:36:25.520\n that happen sort of randomly at different places in space and time. And then the whole sort of\n\n1:36:25.520 --> 1:36:32.080\n theory of physics has to be to do with this graph of causal relationships between these randomly\n\n1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:37.920\n thrown down events. So they've always been confused by the fact that to get even Lorentz\n\n1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:42.880\n invariants, even relativistic invariants, you need a very special way to throw down those events.\n\n1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:48.080\n And they've had no natural way to understand how that would happen. So what Jonathan figured out\n\n1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:56.000\n is that, in fact, from our models, instead of just generating events at random, our models\n\n1:36:56.000 --> 1:37:02.160\n necessarily generate events in some pattern in spacetime effectively that then leads to Lorentz\n\n1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:06.080\n invariants and relativistic invariants and all those kinds of things. So it's a place where\n\n1:37:06.080 --> 1:37:10.240\n all the mathematics that's been done on, well, we just have a random collection of events.\n\n1:37:10.240 --> 1:37:16.000\n Now what consequences does that have in terms of causal set theory and so on? That can all be kind\n\n1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:22.000\n of wheeled in now that we have some different underlying foundational idea for what the\n\n1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.840\n particular distribution of events is as opposed to just what we throw down random events.\n\n1:37:26.400 --> 1:37:32.160\n And so that's a typical sort of example of what we're seeing in all these different areas of kind\n\n1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:36.480\n of how you can take really interesting things that have been done in mathematical physics\n\n1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:43.440\n and connect them. And it's really kind of beautiful because the abstract models we have\n\n1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:48.560\n just seem to plug into all these different very interesting, very elegant abstract ideas.\n\n1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:54.960\n But we're now giving sort of a reason for that to be the way, a reason for one to care. I mean,\n\n1:37:54.960 --> 1:38:01.680\n it's like saying you can think about computation abstractly. You can think about, I don't know,\n\n1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:06.640\n combinators or something as abstract computational things. And you can sort of do all kinds of study\n\n1:38:06.640 --> 1:38:11.040\n of them. But it's like, why do we care? Well, okay, Turing machines are a good start because\n\n1:38:11.040 --> 1:38:14.880\n you can kind of see they're sort of mechanically doing things. But when we actually start thinking\n\n1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:19.920\n about computers, computing things, we have a really good reason to care. And this is sort of\n\n1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:24.640\n what we're providing, I think, is a reason to care about a lot of these areas of mathematical\n\n1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:29.760\n physics. So that's been very nice. So I'm not sure we've ever got to the\n\n1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:36.640\n question of why does the universe exist at all? No, no, let's talk about that. So it's not the\n\n1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:42.960\n simplest question in the world. So it takes a few steps to get to it. And it's nevertheless even\n\n1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:46.800\n surprising that you can even begin to answer this question, as you were saying.\n\n1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:54.400\n Indeed. I'm very surprised. So the next thing to perhaps understand is this idea of ruleal space.\n\n1:38:55.040 --> 1:39:00.240\n So we've got kind of physical space. We've got branchial space, the space of possible quantum\n\n1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:05.840\n histories. And now we've got another level of kind of abstraction, which is ruleal space. And\n\n1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:12.400\n here's where that comes from. So you say, okay, you say we've got this model for the universe.\n\n1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:19.600\n We've got a particular rule. And we run this rule and we get the universe. So that's interesting.\n\n1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:25.200\n Why that rule? Why not another rule? And so that confused me for a long time. And I realized,\n\n1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:31.520\n well, actually, what if the thing could be using all possible rules? What if at every step,\n\n1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:37.600\n in addition to saying apply a particular rule at all places in this hypergraph, one could say,\n\n1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:41.840\n just take all possible rules and apply all possible rules at all possible places in this\n\n1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:48.240\n hypergraph. And then you make this ruleal multiway graph, which both is all possible\n\n1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:53.120\n histories for a particular rule and all possible rules. So the next thing you'd say is, how can you\n\n1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:58.720\n get anything reasonable out of it? How can anything real come out of the set of all possible\n\n1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:04.400\n rules applied in all possible ways? This is a subtle thing, which I haven't fully untangled.\n\n1:40:05.520 --> 1:40:11.440\n There is this object, which is the result of running all possible rules in all possible ways.\n\n1:40:11.440 --> 1:40:15.040\n And you might say, if you're running all possible rules, why can't everything possible happen?\n\n1:40:15.680 --> 1:40:21.840\n Well, the answer is because when you, there's sort of this entanglement that occurs.\n\n1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:27.280\n So let's say that you have a lot of different possible initial conditions, a lot of different\n\n1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:32.800\n possible states. Then you're applying these different rules. Well, some of those rules can\n\n1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:37.200\n end up with the same state. So it isn't the case that you can just get from anywhere to anywhere.\n\n1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:42.080\n There's this whole entangled structure of what can lead to what, and there's a definite structure\n\n1:40:42.080 --> 1:40:48.880\n that's produced. I think I'm going to call that definite structure the rulead, the limit of kind\n\n1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:53.840\n of all possible rules being applied in all possible ways. And you're saying that structure is finite,\n\n1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:59.440\n so that somehow connects to maybe a similar kind of thing as like causal invariance.\n\n1:40:59.440 --> 1:41:03.600\n Well, it happens that the rulead necessarily has causal invariance. That's a feature of,\n\n1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:08.080\n that's just a mathematical consequence of essentially using all possible rules\n\n1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:14.720\n plus universal computation gives you the fact that from any diverging paths, the paths will\n\n1:41:14.720 --> 1:41:20.960\n always converge. But does that necessarily infer that the rulead is finite?\n\n1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:28.240\n In the end, it's not necessarily finite. I mean, just like the history of the universe may not be\n\n1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:32.240\n finite. The history of the universe, time may keep going forever. You can keep running the\n\n1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:37.600\n computations of the rulead and you'll keep spewing out more and more and more structure. It's like\n\n1:41:37.600 --> 1:41:45.520\n time doesn't have to end. But the issue is there are three limits that happen in this rulead\n\n1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:51.280\n object. One is how long you run the computation for. Another is how many different rules you're\n\n1:41:51.280 --> 1:41:56.800\n applying. And another is how many different states you start from. And the mixture of those\n\n1:41:56.800 --> 1:42:02.720\n three limits. I mean, this is just mathematically a horrendous object. And what's interesting about\n\n1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:07.440\n this object is the one thing that does seem to be the case about this object is it connects with\n\n1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:12.800\n ideas in higher category theory. And in particular, it connects to some of the 20th century's most\n\n1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:18.480\n abstract mathematics done by this chap Grothendieck. Grothendieck had a thing called the infinity\n\n1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:24.960\n groupoid, which is closely related to this rulead object. Although the details of the relationship,\n\n1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:31.120\n you know, I don't fully understand yet. But I think that what's interesting is this thing that\n\n1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:37.360\n is sort of this very limiting object. So, okay, so a way to think about this that, again, will\n\n1:42:37.360 --> 1:42:41.520\n take us into another direction, which is the equivalence between physics and mathematics.\n\n1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:50.320\n The way that, well, let's see, maybe this is just to give a sense of this kind of groupoid and\n\n1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:55.120\n things like that. You can think about, in mathematics, you can think you have certain axioms,\n\n1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:01.280\n they're kind of like atoms, and you, well, actually, let's say, let's talk about mathematics\n\n1:43:01.280 --> 1:43:06.960\n for a second. So what is mathematics? What is it made of, so to speak? Mathematics, there's a bunch\n\n1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:13.680\n of statements, like, for addition, x plus y is equal to y plus x, that's a statement in mathematics.\n\n1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:18.240\n Another statement would be, you know, x squared minus one is equal to x plus one, x minus one.\n\n1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:21.840\n There are an infinite number of these possible statements of mathematics.\n\n1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:25.520\n Well, it's not, I mean, it's not just, I guess, a statement, but with x plus y,\n\n1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:29.920\n it's a rule that you can, I mean, you think of it as a rule.\n\n1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:35.760\n It is a rule. It's also just a thing that is true in mathematics.\n\n1:43:35.760 --> 1:43:37.680\n Right. The statement of truth, okay.\n\n1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:44.000\n Right. And what you can imagine is, you imagine just laying out this giant kind of ocean\n\n1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:49.680\n of all statements. Well, actually, you first start, okay, this is where this was segueing\n\n1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:52.240\n into a different thing. Let me not go in this direction for a second.\n\n1:43:52.240 --> 1:43:54.320\n Let's not go to metamathematics just yet.\n\n1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:00.640\n Yeah, we'll maybe get to metamathematics, but it's, so let me not, let me explain the groupoid\n\n1:44:00.640 --> 1:44:07.040\n and things later. But, so let's come back to the universe, always a good place to be in,\n\n1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:07.440\n so to speak.\n\n1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:11.200\n Yeah, so what does the universe have to do with the rule add, the rule of L space,\n\n1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:17.920\n and how that's possibly connected to why the thing exists at all, and why there's just\n\n1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:18.720\n one of them?\n\n1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:24.160\n Yes. Okay. So here's the point. So the thing that had confused me for a long time was,\n\n1:44:24.160 --> 1:44:28.320\n let's say we get the rule for the universe. We hold it in our hand. We say, this is our\n\n1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:33.200\n universe. Then the immediate question is, well, why isn't it another one? And that's\n\n1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:39.920\n kind of the sort of the lesson of Copernicus is, we're not very special. So how come we\n\n1:44:39.920 --> 1:44:46.000\n got universe number 312 and not universe quadrillion, quadrillion, quadrillion? And\n\n1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:52.720\n I think the resolution of that is the realization that the universe is running all possible\n\n1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:58.880\n rules. So then you say, well, how on earth do we perceive the universe to be running\n\n1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:02.640\n according to a particular rule? How do we perceive definite things happening in the\n\n1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:08.560\n universe? Well, it's the same story. It's the observer, there is a reference frame that\n\n1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:14.000\n we are picking in this ruleal space, and that that is what determines our perception of\n\n1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.960\n the universe. With our particular sensory information and so on, we are parsing the\n\n1:45:18.960 --> 1:45:24.800\n universe in this particular way. So here's the way to think about it. In physical space,\n\n1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:29.360\n we live in a particular place in the universe. And we could live on Alpha Centauri, but we\n\n1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:36.560\n don't. We live here. And similarly, in ruleal space, we could live in many different places\n\n1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:41.040\n in ruleal space, but we happen to live here. And what does it mean to live here? It means\n\n1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:47.040\n we have certain sensory input. We have certain ways to parse the universe. Those are our\n\n1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:51.680\n interpretation of the universe. What would it mean to travel in ruleal space? What it\n\n1:45:51.680 --> 1:45:56.080\n basically means is that we are successively interpreting the universe in different ways.\n\n1:45:56.080 --> 1:46:01.520\n So in other words, to be at a different point in ruleal space is to have a different, in a sense,\n\n1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:06.240\n a different interpretation of what's going on in the universe. And we can imagine even\n\n1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:10.880\n things like an analog of the speed of light as the maximum speed of translation in ruleal\n\n1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:18.320\n space and so on. So wait, what's the interpretation? So ruleal space and we,\n\n1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:23.920\n I'm confused by the we and the interpretation and the universe. I thought moving about in\n\n1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:33.680\n ruleal space changes the way the universe is. The way we would perceive it. So it ultimately\n\n1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:40.880\n has to do with the perception. So it doesn't real, ruleal space is not somehow changing,\n\n1:46:41.600 --> 1:46:47.840\n like branching into another universe or something like that. No, I mean, the point is that the whole\n\n1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:54.800\n point of this is the rule yard is sort of the encapsulated version of everything that is the\n\n1:46:54.800 --> 1:47:00.320\n universe running according to all possible rules. We think of our universe, the observable universe,\n\n1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:07.600\n as a thing. So we're a little bit loose with the word universe then, because wouldn't the rule yard\n\n1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:14.320\n potentially encapsulate a very large number, like combinatorially large, maybe infinite\n\n1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:20.960\n set of what we human physicists think of as universes? That's an interesting, interesting\n\n1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:25.920\n parsing of the word universe, right? Because what we're saying is, just as we're at a particular\n\n1:47:25.920 --> 1:47:30.720\n place in physical space, we're at a particular place in ruleal space, at that particular place\n\n1:47:30.720 --> 1:47:35.280\n in ruleal space, our experience of the universe is this. Just as if we lived at the center of the\n\n1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:39.120\n galaxy, our universe, our experience of the universe will be different from the one it is,\n\n1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:47.120\n given where we actually live. And so what we're saying is, you might say, I mean, in a sense,\n\n1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:52.800\n this rule yard is sort of a super universe, so to speak. But it's all entangled together. It's not\n\n1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:58.720\n like you can separate out. You can say, let me, it's like when we take a reference, okay, it's like\n\n1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:03.520\n our experience of the universe is based on where we are in the universe. We could imagine moving\n\n1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:05.840\n to somewhere else in the universe, but it's still the same universe.\n\n1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:10.800\n So there's not like universes existing in parallel?\n\n1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:18.240\n No. Because, and the whole point is that if we were able to change our interpretation of what's\n\n1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:24.000\n going on, we could perceive a different reference frame in this rule yard.\n\n1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:31.040\n Yeah, but that's not, that's just, yeah, that's the same rule yard. That's the same universe.\n\n1:48:31.040 --> 1:48:34.480\n You're just moving about. These are just coordinates in the universe.\n\n1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.680\n Right. So the reason that's interesting is, imagine the extraterrestrial intelligence,\n\n1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:46.080\n so the alien intelligence, we should say. The alien intelligence might live on Alpha Centauri,\n\n1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:48.880\n but it might also live at a different place in real space.\n\n1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:52.560\n It can live right here on Earth. It just has a different reference frame that\n\n1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:57.840\n includes a very different perception of the universe. And then because that\n\n1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:01.760\n real space is very large, I mean,\n\n1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:04.640\n Do we get to communicate with them? Right.\n\n1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:13.360\n Yeah, but it's also, well, one thing is how different the perception of the universe could be.\n\n1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:19.360\n I think it could be bizarrely, unimaginably completely different. And I mean, one thing to\n\n1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:25.600\n realize is, even in kind of things I don't understand well, you know, I know about the kind\n\n1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:30.240\n of Western tradition of understanding, you know, science and all that kind of thing. And, you know,\n\n1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:36.880\n you talk to people who say, well, I, you know, I'm really into some, you know, Eastern tradition of\n\n1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:41.760\n this, that and the other. And it's really obvious to me how things work. I don't understand it\n\n1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:47.280\n at all. But, you know, it is not obvious, I think, with this kind of realization that there's these\n\n1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:52.560\n very different ways to interpret what's going on in the universe. That kind of gives me at least,\n\n1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:57.120\n it doesn't help me to understand that different interpretation. But it gives me at least more\n\n1:49:57.120 --> 1:49:59.920\n respect for the possibility that there will be other interpretations.\n\n1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:06.000\n Yeah, it humbles you to the possibility that like, what is it, reincarnation or all these like\n\n1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:12.000\n eternal recurrence with Nietzsche, like just these ideas? Yeah.\n\n1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:15.840\n Well, you know, the thing that I realized about a bunch of those things is that, you know,\n\n1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:20.160\n I've been sort of doing my little survey of the history of philosophy, just trying to understand,\n\n1:50:20.160 --> 1:50:24.480\n you know, what can I actually say now about some of these things? And you realize that some of\n\n1:50:24.480 --> 1:50:29.920\n these concepts like the immortal soul concept, which, you know, I remember when I was a kid,\n\n1:50:29.920 --> 1:50:35.360\n and, you know, it was kind of a lots of religion bashing type stuff of people saying, you know,\n\n1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:41.760\n well, we know about physics, tell us how much does a soul weigh? And people are like, well,\n\n1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:46.400\n how can it be a thing if it doesn't weigh anything? Well, now we understand, you know,\n\n1:50:46.400 --> 1:50:50.800\n there is this notion of what's in brains that isn't the matter of brains, and it's something\n\n1:50:50.800 --> 1:50:56.320\n computational. And there is a sense and in fact, it is correct, that it is in some sense, immortal,\n\n1:50:56.320 --> 1:51:01.440\n because this pattern of computation is something abstract that is not specific to the particular\n\n1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:07.360\n material of a brain. Now, we don't know how to extract it, you know, in our traditional scientific\n\n1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:13.440\n approach. But it's still something where it isn't a crazy thing to say there is something doesn't\n\n1:51:13.440 --> 1:51:19.120\n weigh anything. That's a kind of a silly question. How much does it weigh? Well, actually, maybe it\n\n1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:24.160\n isn't such a silly question in our model of physics, because the actual computational activity\n\n1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:27.520\n has has a consequence for gravity and things, but that's a very subtle.\n\n1:51:27.520 --> 1:51:33.680\n You can talk about mass and energy and so on. That could be a, what would you call it, a solitron.\n\n1:51:35.040 --> 1:51:36.160\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n1:51:36.160 --> 1:51:39.520\n A particle that somehow contains soulness.\n\n1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:43.680\n Yeah, right. Well, that's what, by the way, that's what Leibniz said. And, you know,\n\n1:51:43.680 --> 1:51:48.320\n one thing I've never understood this, you know, Leibniz had this idea of monads and monadology,\n\n1:51:48.320 --> 1:51:53.040\n and he had this idea that what exists in the universe is this big collection of monads.\n\n1:51:53.040 --> 1:51:57.520\n And that they that the only thing that one knows about the monads is sort of how they relate to\n\n1:51:57.520 --> 1:52:02.880\n each other. It sounds awfully like hypergraphs, right? But Leibniz had really lost me at the\n\n1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:08.400\n following thing. He said, each of these monads has a soul, and each of them has a consciousness.\n\n1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:12.480\n And it's like, okay, I'm out of here. I don't understand this at all. I don't know what's\n\n1:52:12.480 --> 1:52:19.360\n going on. But I realized recently that in his day, the concept that a thing could do something\n\n1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:23.200\n could spontaneously do something. That was his only way of describing that.\n\n1:52:23.760 --> 1:52:29.120\n And so what I would now say is, well, there's this abstract rule that runs. To Leibniz,\n\n1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:33.440\n that would have been, you know, in 1690 or whatever, that would have been kind of,\n\n1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:38.640\n well, it has a soul, it has a consciousness. And so, you know, in a sense, it's like one\n\n1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:43.760\n of these, there's no new idea under the sun, so to speak. That's a sort of a version of the same\n\n1:52:43.760 --> 1:52:48.880\n kinds of ideas, but couched in terms that are sort of bizarrely different from the ones that\n\n1:52:48.880 --> 1:52:54.320\n we would use today. Would you be able to maybe play devil's advocate on your conception of\n\n1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:59.360\n consciousness that, like the two characteristics of it that is constrained, and there's a\n\n1:52:59.920 --> 1:53:07.600\n single thread of time? Is it possible that Leibniz was onto something that the basic atom,\n\n1:53:07.600 --> 1:53:14.960\n the discrete atom of space has a consciousness? Is that, so these are just words, right? But like,\n\n1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:19.440\n what is there? Is there some sense where consciousness is much more fundamental\n\n1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:24.000\n than you're making it seem? I don't know. I mean, you know, I think...\n\n1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.720\n Can you construct a world in which it is much more fundamental?\n\n1:53:27.280 --> 1:53:32.720\n I think that, okay, so the question would be, is there a way to think about kind of,\n\n1:53:33.440 --> 1:53:38.560\n if we sort of parse the universe down at the level of atoms of space or something,\n\n1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:42.080\n could we say, well, so that's really a question of a different point of view,\n\n1:53:42.080 --> 1:53:47.200\n a different place in real space. We're asking the question, could there be a civilization\n\n1:53:47.200 --> 1:53:54.080\n that exists? Could there be sort of conscious entities that exist at the level of atoms of\n\n1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:57.840\n space? And what would that be like? And I think that comes back to this question of,\n\n1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:05.920\n what's it like to be a cellular automaton type thing? I mean, I'm not yet there. I don't know.\n\n1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:12.800\n I mean, I think that this is a... And I know I don't even know yet quite how to think about this\n\n1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:17.520\n in the sense that I was considering, you know, I never write fiction, but I haven't written it\n\n1:54:17.520 --> 1:54:22.160\n since I was like 10 years old. And my fiction, I made one attempt, which I sent to some science\n\n1:54:22.160 --> 1:54:25.280\n fiction writer friends of mine, and they told me it was terrible. So, but...\n\n1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:26.720\n This is a long time ago?\n\n1:54:26.720 --> 1:54:27.920\n No, this is recently.\n\n1:54:27.920 --> 1:54:31.920\n Recently. They said it was terrible. That'd be interesting to see you write a short story\n\n1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:38.080\n based on what sounds like it's already inspiring short stories or stories by science fiction\n\n1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:38.800\n writers.\n\n1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:45.040\n But I think the interesting thing for me is, you know, what is it like to be a whatever?\n\n1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:49.520\n How do you describe that? I mean, that's not a thing that you describe in mathematics,\n\n1:54:49.520 --> 1:54:51.760\n the what is it like to be such and such.\n\n1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:55.600\n Well, see, to me, when you say what is it like to be something,\n\n1:54:55.600 --> 1:55:06.720\n it presumes that you're talking about a singular entity. So, like, there's some kind of feeling of\n\n1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:12.160\n the entity, the stuff that's inside of it and the stuff that's outside of it.\n\n1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:20.080\n And then that's when consciousness starts making sense. But then it seems like that could be\n\n1:55:20.080 --> 1:55:26.880\n generalizable. If you take some subset of a cellular automata, you could start talking\n\n1:55:26.880 --> 1:55:33.360\n about what does that subset feel. But then you can, I think you could just take arbitrary\n\n1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:41.760\n numbers of subsets. Like, to me, like, you and I individually are consciousnesses,\n\n1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:45.680\n but you could also say the two of us together is a singular consciousness.\n\n1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:49.840\n Maybe, maybe. I'm not so sure about that. I think that the single thread of time thing\n\n1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:54.800\n may be pretty important. And that as soon as you start saying, there are two different threads\n\n1:55:54.800 --> 1:55:59.280\n of time, there are two different experiences, and then we have to say, how do they relate?\n\n1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:03.520\n How are they sort of entangled with each other? I mean, that may be a different story of a thing\n\n1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:08.960\n that isn't much like, you know, what do the ants, you know, what's it like to be an ant,\n\n1:56:08.960 --> 1:56:12.880\n you know, where there's a sort of more collective view of the world, so to speak?\n\n1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:20.800\n I don't know. I think that, I mean, this is, you know, I don't really have a good, I mean,\n\n1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:26.240\n you know, my best thought is, you know, can we turn it into a human story? It's like the question\n\n1:56:26.240 --> 1:56:30.480\n of, you know, when we try and understand physics, can we turn that into something which is sort of\n\n1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:36.160\n a human understandable narrative? And now what's it like to be a such and such? You know, maybe the\n\n1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:41.040\n only medium in which we can describe that is something like fiction, where it's kind of like\n\n1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:48.720\n you're telling, you know, the life story in that setting. But I'm, this is beyond what I've yet\n\n1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:53.280\n understood how to do. Yeah, but it does seem so, like with human consciousness, you know,\n\n1:56:53.280 --> 1:57:01.120\n we're made up of cells and like, there's a bunch of systems that are networked that work together\n\n1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:07.920\n that at this, at the human level, feel like a singular consciousness when you take, and so\n\n1:57:07.920 --> 1:57:14.400\n maybe like an ant colony is just too low level. Sorry, an ant is too low level. Maybe you have to\n\n1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:20.320\n look at the ant colony. Yeah, I agree. There's some level at which it's a conscious being. And then\n\n1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:26.080\n if you go to the planetary scale, then maybe that's going too far. So there's a nice sweet spot for\n\n1:57:26.080 --> 1:57:33.920\n consciousness. No, I agree. I think the difficulty is that, you know, okay, so in sort of people who\n\n1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:38.400\n talk about consciousness, one of the terrible things I've realized, because I've now interacted\n\n1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:44.240\n with some of this community, so to speak, some interesting people who do that kind of thinking.\n\n1:57:44.240 --> 1:57:48.400\n But, you know, one of the things I was saying to one of the leading people in that area, I was\n\n1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:55.200\n saying, you know, that, you know, it must be kind of frustrating because it's kind of like a poetry\n\n1:57:55.200 --> 1:57:59.840\n story. That is many people are writing poems, but few people are reading them. So there are always\n\n1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:04.720\n these different, you know, everybody has their own theory of consciousness, and they are very\n\n1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:11.760\n non inter sort of inter discussable. And by the way, I mean, you know, my own approach to sort of\n\n1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:16.560\n the question of consciousness, as far as I'm concerned, I'm an applied consciousness operative,\n\n1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:21.760\n so to speak, because I don't really, in a sense, the thing I'm trying to get out of it is how does\n\n1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:27.600\n it help me to understand what's a possible theory of physics? And how does it help me to say,\n\n1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:34.000\n how do I go from this incoherent collection of things happening in the universe to our definite\n\n1:58:34.000 --> 1:58:38.880\n perception and definite laws and so on, and sort of an applied version of consciousness? And I\n\n1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:44.000\n think the reason it sort of segues to a different kind of topic, but the reason that one of the\n\n1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:48.480\n things I'm particularly interested in is kind of what's the analog of consciousness in systems\n\n1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:54.640\n very different from brains? And so why is that matter? Well, you know, this whole description\n\n1:58:54.640 --> 1:59:00.400\n of this kind of, you know what, we haven't talked about why the universe exists. So let's get to why\n\n1:59:00.400 --> 1:59:06.800\n the universe exists. And then we can talk about perhaps a little bit about what these models of\n\n1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:12.000\n physics kind of show you about other kinds of things like molecular computing and so on.\n\n1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:13.200\n Yes, that's good.\n\n1:59:13.200 --> 1:59:17.120\n Why does the universe exist? Okay, so we finally sort of more or less set the stage,\n\n1:59:17.120 --> 1:59:22.080\n we've got this idea of this rule yard of this object that is made from following all possible\n\n1:59:22.080 --> 1:59:27.600\n rules, the fact that it's sort of not just this incoherent mess, it's got all this entangled\n\n1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:35.600\n structure in it, and so on. Okay, so what is this rule yard? Well, it is the working out of all\n\n1:59:35.600 --> 1:59:41.200\n possible formal systems. So the sort of the question of why does the universe exist? Its\n\n1:59:41.200 --> 1:59:46.240\n core question, which we kind of started with is, you've got two plus two equals four, you've got\n\n1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:52.560\n some other abstract result, but that's not actualized. It's just an abstract thing.\n\n1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:56.160\n And when we say we've got a model for the universe, okay, it's this rule, you run it,\n\n1:59:56.160 --> 2:00:03.440\n and it'll make the universe, but it's like, but where's it actually running? What is it actually\n\n2:00:03.440 --> 2:00:11.760\n doing? Is it actual, or is it merely a formal description of something? So the thing to realize\n\n2:00:11.760 --> 2:00:19.760\n with this, the thing about the rule yard is it's an inevitable, it is the entangled running of all\n\n2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:25.280\n possible rules. So you don't get to say, it's not like you're saying, which rule yard are you\n\n2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:32.560\n picking? Because it's all possible formal rules. It's not like it's just, well, actually, it's\n\n2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:37.120\n only footnote. The only footnote, it's an important footnote, is it's all possible\n\n2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:45.440\n computational rules, not hyper computational rules. That is, it's running all the rules that would be\n\n2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:51.520\n accessible to a Turing machine, but it is not running all the rules that will be accessible\n\n2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:56.400\n to a thing that can solve problems in finite time that would take a Turing machine infinite time to\n\n2:00:56.400 --> 2:01:01.520\n solve. So you can, even Alan Turing knew this, that you could make oracles for Turing machines,\n\n2:01:01.520 --> 2:01:05.520\n where you say a Turing machine can't solve the whole thing problem for Turing machines. It can't\n\n2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:10.000\n know what will happen in any Turing machine after an infinite time, in any finite time,\n\n2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:15.600\n but you could invent a box, just make a black box. You say, I'm going to sell you an oracle\n\n2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:19.280\n that will just tell you, you know, press this button. It'll tell you what the Turing machine\n\n2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:23.920\n will do after an infinite time. You can imagine such a box. You can't necessarily build one in\n\n2:01:23.920 --> 2:01:29.120\n the physical universe, but you can imagine such a box. And so we could say, well, in addition to,\n\n2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:36.400\n so in this Rulliad, we're imagining that there is a computational, that at the end, it's running\n\n2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:42.880\n rules that are computational. It doesn't have a bunch of oracle black boxes in it. You say, well,\n\n2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:48.800\n why not? Well, it turns out if there are oracle black boxes, the Rulliad that is,\n\n2:01:48.800 --> 2:01:53.040\n you can make a sort of super Rulliad that contains those oracle black boxes,\n\n2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.360\n but it has a cosmological event horizon relative to the first one. They can't communicate.\n\n2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:05.360\n In other words, you can end up with, what ends up happening is it's like in the physical universe,\n\n2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:09.920\n in this causal graph that represents the causal relationships of different things,\n\n2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:16.400\n you can have an event horizon where the causal graph is disconnected, where the effect here,\n\n2:02:16.400 --> 2:02:20.720\n an event happening here does not affect an event happening here because there's a disconnection\n\n2:02:20.720 --> 2:02:26.400\n in the causal graph. And that's what happens in an event horizon. And so what will happen between\n\n2:02:26.400 --> 2:02:34.480\n this kind of the ordinary Rulliad and the hyper Rulliad is there is an event horizon and we,\n\n2:02:34.480 --> 2:02:42.880\n in our Rulliad, will just never know that they're just separate things. They're not connected.\n\n2:02:42.880 --> 2:02:46.000\n And maybe I'm not understanding, but just because we can't observe it,\n\n2:02:47.760 --> 2:02:49.200\n why does that mean it doesn't exist?\n\n2:02:49.200 --> 2:02:57.200\n So it might exist, but it's not clear what it... So what, so to speak, whether it exists. What\n\n2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:01.600\n we're trying to understand is why does our universe exist? We're not trying to ask the\n\n2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:10.640\n question what... Let me say another thing. Let me make a meta comment, which is that I have not\n\n2:03:10.640 --> 2:03:18.320\n thought through this hyper Rulliad business properly. So I can't... The hyper Rulliad is\n\n2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:22.640\n referring to a Rulliad in which hyper computation is possible.\n\n2:03:22.640 --> 2:03:23.680\n That's correct. Yes.\n\n2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:33.280\n Okay. So the footnote to the footnote is we're not sure why this is important.\n\n2:03:33.280 --> 2:03:39.120\n Yeah, that's right. So let's ignore that. Okay. It's already abstract enough. Okay. So,\n\n2:03:39.920 --> 2:03:46.800\n okay. So the one question is we have to say, if we're saying, why does the universe exist?\n\n2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:52.480\n One question is why is it this universe and not another universe? Okay. So the important point\n\n2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:59.840\n about this Rulliad idea is that in the Rulliad are all possible formal systems. So there's no\n\n2:03:59.840 --> 2:04:05.360\n choice being made. There's no like, oh, we pick this particular universe and not that one. That's\n\n2:04:05.360 --> 2:04:12.640\n the first thing. The second thing is that we have to ask the question. So you say, why does two plus\n\n2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:20.720\n two equals four exist? That is a thing that necessarily is that way just on the basis of\n\n2:04:20.720 --> 2:04:27.520\n the meaning of the terms, two and plus and equals and so on. So the thing is that this Rulliad\n\n2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:34.560\n object is in a sense a necessary object. It is just the thing that is the consequence of working\n\n2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:40.480\n out the consequence of the formal definition of things. It is not a thing where you're saying,\n\n2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:47.760\n and this is picked as the particular thing. This is just something which necessarily is that thing\n\n2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:53.920\n because of the definition of what it means to have computation. So the Rulliad, it's a formal system.\n\n2:04:54.480 --> 2:05:02.560\n Yes. But does it exist? Ah, well, where are we in this whole thing?\n\n2:05:02.560 --> 2:05:10.560\n Yes. We are part of this Rulliad. So there is no sense to say, does two plus\n\n2:05:10.560 --> 2:05:19.600\n two equals four exist? Well, in some sense, it necessarily exists. It's a necessary object. It's\n\n2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:25.920\n not a thing that way you can ask. Usually in philosophy, there's a sort of distinction made\n\n2:05:25.920 --> 2:05:32.000\n between necessary truths, contingent truths, analytic propositions, synthetic propositions\n\n2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:37.200\n that are a variety of different versions of this. They're things which are necessarily true just\n\n2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:42.240\n based on the definition of terms. And there are things which happen to be true in our universe.\n\n2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:49.840\n But we don't exist in Rullial space. That's one of the coordinates that define our existence.\n\n2:05:51.200 --> 2:05:58.240\n Well, okay. So yes, yes. But this Rulliad is the set of all possible Rullial coordinates.\n\n2:05:58.240 --> 2:06:04.880\n So what we're saying is it contains that. So what we're saying is we exist as, okay, so\n\n2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:09.280\n our perception of what's going on is we're at a particular place in this Rulliad,\n\n2:06:09.280 --> 2:06:12.960\n and we are concluding certain things about how the universe works based on that.\n\n2:06:13.520 --> 2:06:19.760\n But the question is, do we understand, you know, is there something where we say,\n\n2:06:19.760 --> 2:06:27.360\n okay, so why does it work that way? Well, the answer is, I think it has to work that way,\n\n2:06:27.360 --> 2:06:35.360\n because this Rulliad is a necessary object in the sense that it is a purely formal object,\n\n2:06:35.360 --> 2:06:41.600\n just like 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's not an object that was made of something. It's an object that\n\n2:06:41.600 --> 2:06:46.480\n is just an expression of the necessary collection of formal relations that exist.\n\n2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:53.280\n And so then the issue is, can we, in our experience of that, is it, you know, can we have\n\n2:06:53.280 --> 2:07:00.080\n tables and chairs, so to speak, in that just by virtue of our experience of that necessary thing?\n\n2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:06.960\n And, you know, what people have generally thought, and I don't know of a lot of discussion of this,\n\n2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:12.240\n why does the universe exist question? It's been a very, you know, I've been surprised actually at\n\n2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:17.520\n how little, I mean, I think it's one of these things that's really kind of far out there. But\n\n2:07:17.520 --> 2:07:25.840\n the thing that is, you know, the surprise here is that all possible formal rules, when you run them\n\n2:07:25.840 --> 2:07:30.080\n together, and that's the critical thing, when you run them together, they produce this kind of\n\n2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:37.040\n entangled structure that has a definite structure. It's not just, you know, a random arbitrary thing,\n\n2:07:37.040 --> 2:07:42.640\n it's a thing with definite structure. And that structure is the thing when we are embedded in\n\n2:07:42.640 --> 2:07:48.960\n that structure, when anything, you know, an entity embedded in that structure perceives something,\n\n2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:54.240\n which is then we can interpret as physics and things like this. So in other words, we don't\n\n2:07:54.240 --> 2:08:00.080\n have to ask the question, the why does it exist? It necessarily exists.\n\n2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:02.880\n I'm missing this part. Why does it necessarily exist?\n\n2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:03.520\n Okay, okay.\n\n2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:11.600\n So like, you need to have it if you want to formalize the relation between entities, but\n\n2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:15.760\n why do you need to have relations?\n\n2:08:15.760 --> 2:08:22.480\n Okay, okay. So let's say you say, well...\n\n2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:24.800\n It's like, why does math have to exist?\n\n2:08:24.800 --> 2:08:32.880\n Fair question. Okay, fair question. Let's see. I think the thing to think about is\n\n2:08:33.520 --> 2:08:38.640\n the existence of mathematics is something where given a definition of terms,\n\n2:08:40.080 --> 2:08:47.520\n what follows from that definition inevitably follows. So now you can say, why define any terms?\n\n2:08:47.520 --> 2:08:56.240\n But in a sense, the, well, that's okay. So the definition of terms, I mean, I think the way to\n\n2:08:56.240 --> 2:08:58.080\n think about this, let me see.\n\n2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:01.360\n So like concrete terms.\n\n2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:09.280\n Well, they're not very concrete. I mean, they're just things like, you know, logical or.\n\n2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:13.280\n Right, but that's a thing. That's a powerful thing.\n\n2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:20.720\n Well, yes, okay. But the point is that it is not a thing of a, you know, people imagine there is,\n\n2:09:20.720 --> 2:09:28.080\n I don't know, the, you know, an elephant or something or the, you know, elephants are presumably\n\n2:09:28.080 --> 2:09:34.720\n not necessary objects. They happen to exist as a result of kind of biological evolution and\n\n2:09:34.720 --> 2:09:43.360\n whatever else. But the thing is that in some sense that there is, it is a different kind of thing\n\n2:09:43.360 --> 2:09:48.640\n to say, does plus exist? It's not like an elephant.\n\n2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:56.800\n So a plus seems more fundamental, more basic than an elephant. Yes. But you can imagine a world\n\n2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:05.920\n without plus or anything like it. Like, why do formal things that are discrete, that can be used\n\n2:10:05.920 --> 2:10:08.400\n to reason have to exist?\n\n2:10:08.400 --> 2:10:14.960\n Well, okay. So why? Okay. So then the question is, but the whole point is computation.\n\n2:10:14.960 --> 2:10:21.120\n We can certainly imagine computation. That is, we can certainly say there is a formal system that\n\n2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:30.240\n we can construct abstractly in our minds that is computation. And that's the, you know, we can\n\n2:10:30.240 --> 2:10:39.840\n imagine it. Now the question is, is it that formal system, once we exist as observers embedded in\n\n2:10:39.840 --> 2:10:46.720\n that formal system, that's enough to have something which is like our universe. And so then what\n\n2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:53.760\n you're kind of asking is perhaps is why, I mean, the point is we definitely can imagine it.\n\n2:10:53.760 --> 2:11:02.800\n There's nothing that says that we're not saying that it's sort of inevitable that that is a thing\n\n2:11:02.800 --> 2:11:07.760\n that we can imagine. We don't have to ask, does it exist? We're just, it is definitely something\n\n2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:15.200\n we can imagine. Now that's, then we have this thing that is a formally constructible thing\n\n2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:20.640\n that we can imagine. And now we have to ask the question, what, you know, given that formally\n\n2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:28.080\n constructible thing, what is, what consequences does that, if we were to perceive that formally,\n\n2:11:28.080 --> 2:11:33.280\n if we were embedded in that formally constructible thing, what would we perceive about the world?\n\n2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:40.480\n And we would say, we perceive that the world exists because we are seeing all of this mechanism\n\n2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:46.720\n of all these things happening. And, but that's something that is just a feature of, it's something\n\n2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:53.120\n where we are... See, another way of asking this that I'm trying to get at, I understand why it\n\n2:11:53.120 --> 2:12:04.560\n feels like this ruley ad is necessary, but maybe it's just me being human, but it feels like then\n\n2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:11.280\n you should be able to, not us, but somehow step outside of the ruley ad. Like what's outside the\n\n2:12:11.280 --> 2:12:17.600\n ruley ad? Well, the ruley ad is all formal systems. So there's nothing because... But that's what a\n\n2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:22.240\n human would say. I know that's what a human would say, because we're used to the idea that there are,\n\n2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:29.200\n there's, but the whole point is that by the time it's all possible formal systems, it's, it's like,\n\n2:12:29.200 --> 2:12:36.960\n it is all things you can imagine, but... All computations you can imagine, but like we don't...\n\n2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:45.200\n Well, so the issue is, can we encode? Okay. So that's a fair question. Is it possible to encode\n\n2:12:45.200 --> 2:12:52.000\n all, I mean, once we, is there something that isn't what we can represent formally?\n\n2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:57.600\n Right. That is, is there something that, and that's, I think, related to the hyper ruley ad\n\n2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:04.000\n footnote, so to speak, which I'm afraid that the, you know, one of the things sort of interesting\n\n2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:08.880\n about this is, you know, there has been some discussion of this in theology and things like\n\n2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:18.880\n that, but, which I don't necessarily understand all of, but the key sort of new input is this idea\n\n2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:25.280\n that all possible formal systems, it's like, you know, if you make a world, people say, well, you\n\n2:13:25.280 --> 2:13:30.400\n make a world with a particular, in a particular way with particular rules, but no, you don't do\n\n2:13:30.400 --> 2:13:37.520\n that. You can make a world that deals with all possible rules, and then merely by virtue of\n\n2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:42.800\n living in a particular place in that world, so to speak, we have the perception we have of what the\n\n2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:49.360\n world is like. Now, I have to say the, it's sort of interesting because I've, you know, I wrote this\n\n2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:57.520\n piece about this, and I, you know, this philosophy stuff is not super easy, and I've, as I'm talking\n\n2:13:57.520 --> 2:14:00.880\n to you about it, and I actually haven't, you know, people have been interested in lots of different\n\n2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:05.360\n things we've been doing, but this, why does the universe exist, has been, I would say, one of the,\n\n2:14:05.360 --> 2:14:10.720\n one of the ones that you would think people will be most interested in, but actually, I think\n\n2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:17.200\n they're just like, oh, that's just something complicated that, so I haven't, I haven't explained\n\n2:14:17.200 --> 2:14:21.120\n it as much as I've explained a bunch of other things, and I have to say, I think I, I think I\n\n2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:27.520\n may be missing a couple of pieces of that argument that would be, so it's kind of a like\u2026\n\n2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:32.720\n Well, you are, your conscious being is computationally bounded, so you're missing\u2026\n\n2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:33.200\n Indeed.\n\n2:14:33.200 --> 2:14:38.560\n Having written quite a few articles yourself, you're now missing some of the pieces.\n\n2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:39.120\n Yes, right.\n\n2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:40.880\n That's the limitation of being human.\n\n2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:46.960\n Right. One of the consequences of this, why the universe exists thing, is that you're missing\n\n2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:53.840\n something, and this kind of concept of rule adds and, you know, places in there representing our\n\n2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:59.680\n perception of the universe and so on. One of the weird consequences is, if the universe exists,\n\n2:14:59.680 --> 2:15:06.320\n mathematics must also exist. And that's a weird thing, because mathematics, people have been very\n\n2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:14.640\n confused, including me, have been very confused about the question of kind of what, what is the\n\n2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:20.080\n definition of mathematics? What is, what kind of a thing is mathematics? Is mathematics something\n\n2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:25.200\n where we just write down axioms like Euclid did for geometry, and we just build the structure,\n\n2:15:25.200 --> 2:15:28.960\n and we could have written down different axioms, and we'd have a different structure? Or is it\n\n2:15:28.960 --> 2:15:33.280\n something that has a more fundamental sort of truth to it? And I have to say, this is one of\n\n2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:38.320\n these cases where I've long believed that mathematics has a great deal of arbitrariness to\n\n2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:43.360\n it, that there are particular axioms that kind of got written down by the Babylonians, and, you\n\n2:15:43.360 --> 2:15:47.120\n know, that's what we've ended up with the mathematics that we have. And I have to say,\n\n2:15:47.120 --> 2:15:51.600\n actually, my wife has been telling me for 25 years, she was a mathematician, she's been telling me,\n\n2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:57.120\n you're wrong about the foundations of mathematics. And, you know, I'm like, no, no, no, I know what\n\n2:15:57.120 --> 2:16:04.160\n I'm talking about. And finally, she's much more right than I've been. So it's one of the...\n\n2:16:04.160 --> 2:16:11.600\n So, I mean, her sense and your sense, are we just, so this is to the question of metamathematics,\n\n2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:18.080\n just kind of on a trajectory through ruleal space, except in mathematics, through a trajectory of\n\n2:16:18.080 --> 2:16:23.920\n a certain kind of... I think that's partly the idea. So I think that the notion is this. So 100\n\n2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:28.320\n years ago, a little bit more than 100 years ago, people have been doing mathematics for ages,\n\n2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:34.640\n but then in the late 1800s, people decided to try and formalize mathematics and say, you know,\n\n2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:38.720\n it is mathematics is, you know, we're going to break it down, we're going to make it like logic,\n\n2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:43.600\n make it out of sort of fundamental primitives. And that was people like Frager and Piano and\n\n2:16:43.600 --> 2:16:50.160\n Hilbert and so on. And they kind of got this idea of let's do kind of Euclid, but even better,\n\n2:16:50.160 --> 2:16:54.480\n let's just make everything just in terms of this sort of symbolic axioms, and then build\n\n2:16:54.480 --> 2:17:00.880\n up mathematics from that. And that, you know, they thought at the time, as soon as they get\n\n2:17:00.880 --> 2:17:05.280\n these symbolic axioms, that they made the same mistake, the kind of computational irreducibility\n\n2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:10.960\n mistake. They thought as soon as we've written down the axioms, then we'll just have a machine,\n\n2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:16.880\n kind of a super mathematical, so to speak, that can just grind out all true theorems of mathematics.\n\n2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:21.680\n That got exploited by G\u00f6del's theorem, which is basically the story of computational\n\n2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:26.720\n irreducibility. It's that even though you know those underlying rules, you can't deduce all\n\n2:17:26.720 --> 2:17:34.000\n the consequences in any finite way. But now the question is, okay, so they broke mathematics down\n\n2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:40.160\n into these axioms, and they say now you build up from that. So what I'm increasingly coming to\n\n2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:46.960\n realize is that's similar to saying let's take a gas and break it down into molecules. There's gas\n\n2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:52.480\n laws that are the large scale structure and so on that we humans are familiar with, and then there's\n\n2:17:52.480 --> 2:17:57.680\n the underlying molecular dynamics. And I think that the axiomatic level of mathematics, which\n\n2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:02.640\n we can access with automated theorem proving and proof assistance and these kinds of things,\n\n2:18:02.640 --> 2:18:07.440\n that's the molecular dynamics of mathematics. And occasionally we see through to that molecular\n\n2:18:07.440 --> 2:18:12.160\n dynamics. We see undecidability, we see other things like this. One of the things I've always\n\n2:18:12.160 --> 2:18:18.560\n found very mysterious is that G\u00f6del's theorem shows that there are sort of things which cannot\n\n2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:23.280\n be finitely proved in mathematics. There are proofs of arbitrary length, infinite length proofs that\n\n2:18:23.280 --> 2:18:28.080\n you might need. But in practical mathematics, mathematicians don't typically run into this.\n\n2:18:28.080 --> 2:18:32.640\n They just happily go along doing their mathematics. And I think what's actually\n\n2:18:32.640 --> 2:18:38.160\n happening is that what they're doing is they're looking at this. They are essentially observers\n\n2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:45.440\n in metamathematical space, and they are picking a reference frame in metamathematical space,\n\n2:18:45.440 --> 2:18:49.120\n and they are computationally bounded observers in metamathematical space,\n\n2:18:49.120 --> 2:18:55.520\n which is causing them to deduce that the laws of metamathematics and the laws of mathematics,\n\n2:18:55.520 --> 2:19:00.080\n like the laws of fluid mechanics, are much more understandable than this underlying\n\n2:19:00.080 --> 2:19:06.320\n molecular dynamics. And so what gets really bizarre is thinking about kind of the analogy\n\n2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:14.960\n between metamathematics, this idea of you exist in this sort of space of possible,\n\n2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:21.760\n in this kind of mathematical space where the individual kind of points in the mathematical\n\n2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:27.280\n space are statements in mathematics, and they're connected by proofs where one statement, you know,\n\n2:19:27.280 --> 2:19:30.960\n you take a couple of different statements, you can use those to prove some other statement,\n\n2:19:30.960 --> 2:19:35.760\n and you've got this whole network of proofs. That's the kind of causal network of mathematics,\n\n2:19:35.760 --> 2:19:42.720\n of what can prove what and so on. And you can say at any moment in the history of a mathematician,\n\n2:19:42.720 --> 2:19:49.280\n of a single mathematical consciousness, you are in a single kind of slice of this\n\n2:19:49.280 --> 2:19:54.000\n kind of metamathematical space. You know a certain set of mathematical statements.\n\n2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.640\n You can then deduce with proofs, you can deduce other ones, and so on. You're kind of gradually\n\n2:19:58.640 --> 2:20:04.400\n moving through metamathematical space. And so it's kind of the view is that the reason that\n\n2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:10.160\n mathematicians perceive mathematics to have the sort of integrity and lack of kind of undecidability\n\n2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:15.360\n and so on that they do is because they, like we as observers of the physical universe,\n\n2:20:15.360 --> 2:20:19.920\n we have these limitations associated with computational boundedness, single thread of time,\n\n2:20:19.920 --> 2:20:24.960\n consciousness limitations, basically, that the same thing is true of mathematicians perceiving\n\n2:20:24.960 --> 2:20:30.080\n sort of metamathematical space. And so what's happening is that if you look at one of these\n\n2:20:30.080 --> 2:20:36.640\n formalized mathematics systems, something like Pythagoras's theorem, it'll take, oh, I don't know,\n\n2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:43.600\n what is it, maybe 10,000 individual little steps to prove Pythagoras's theorem. And one of the\n\n2:20:43.600 --> 2:20:48.400\n bizarre things that's sort of an empirical fact that I'm trying to understand a little bit better,\n\n2:20:48.400 --> 2:20:54.160\n if you look at different formalized mathematics systems, they actually have different axioms\n\n2:20:54.160 --> 2:20:59.200\n underneath that they can all prove Pythagoras's theorem. And so in other words, it's a little bit\n\n2:20:59.200 --> 2:21:03.840\n like what happens with gases. We can have air molecules, we can have water molecules, but they\n\n2:21:03.840 --> 2:21:09.440\n still have fluid dynamics. Both of them have fluid dynamics. And so similarly, at the level that\n\n2:21:09.440 --> 2:21:14.000\n mathematicians care about mathematics, it's way above the molecular dynamics, so to speak.\n\n2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:18.160\n And there are all kinds of weird things. Like, for example, one thing I was realizing recently\n\n2:21:18.160 --> 2:21:23.280\n is that the quantum theory of mathematics, that's a very bizarre idea. But basically,\n\n2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:29.520\n when you prove what is a proof is you've got one statement in mathematics, you go through\n\n2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:32.960\n other statements, you eventually get to a statement you're trying to prove, for example,\n\n2:21:32.960 --> 2:21:38.880\n that's a path in metamathematical space. And that's a single path, a single proof is a single\n\n2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:44.960\n path. But you can imagine there are other proofs of the same result. There are a bundle of proofs.\n\n2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:48.560\n There's this whole set of possible proofs. Yeah, you could think of it as branching,\n\n2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:52.320\n similar to the quantum mechanics model that you were talking about. Exactly. And then there's\n\n2:21:52.320 --> 2:21:56.720\n some invariance that you can formalize in the same way that you can for the quantum mechanical.\n\n2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:01.520\n Right. So the question is, in proof space, as you start thinking about multiple proofs,\n\n2:22:01.520 --> 2:22:05.680\n are there analogs of, for example, destructive interference of multiple proofs? So here's a\n\n2:22:05.680 --> 2:22:12.480\n bizarre idea that's just a couple of days old, so not yet fully formed. But as you try and do that,\n\n2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:16.240\n when you have two different proofs, it's like two photons going in different directions,\n\n2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:20.960\n you have two proofs, which at an intermediate stage are incompatible. And that's kind of like\n\n2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:26.960\n destructive interference. Is it possible for this to instruct the engineering of automated proof\n\n2:22:26.960 --> 2:22:31.920\n systems? Absolutely. I mean, as a practical matter, I mean, you know, this whole question,\n\n2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:36.560\n in fact, Jonathan Gorod has a nice heuristic for automated theorem provers that's based on\n\n2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:44.400\n our physics project that is looking for essentially using kind of using energy in our\n\n2:22:44.400 --> 2:22:51.040\n models. Energy is kind of level of activity in this hypergraph. And so it's sort of a heuristic\n\n2:22:51.040 --> 2:22:57.440\n for automated theorem proving about how do you pick which path to go down that is based on\n\n2:22:57.440 --> 2:23:03.600\n essentially physics. And I mean, the thing that gets interesting about this is the way that one\n\n2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:07.360\n can sort of have the interplay between, like, for example, a black hole. What is a black hole\n\n2:23:07.360 --> 2:23:12.960\n in metamathematics? So the answer is, what is black hole in physics? A black hole in physics\n\n2:23:12.960 --> 2:23:19.600\n is where in the simplest form of black hole time ends. That is all, you know, everything is crunched\n\n2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:24.960\n down to the space time singularity, and everything just ends up at that singularity. So in our\n\n2:23:24.960 --> 2:23:29.520\n models, and that's a little hard to understand in general relativity with continuous mathematics,\n\n2:23:29.520 --> 2:23:33.840\n and what does singularity look like? In our models, it's something very pragmatic. It's just,\n\n2:23:33.840 --> 2:23:37.760\n you're applying these rules, time is moving forward. And then there comes a moment where\n\n2:23:37.760 --> 2:23:43.280\n the rules, no rules apply. So time stops. It's kind of like the universe dies, that, you know,\n\n2:23:43.280 --> 2:23:49.200\n that nothing happens in the universe anymore. Well, in mathematics, that's a decidable theory.\n\n2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:53.280\n That's a theory. So theories which have undecidability, which are things like\n\n2:23:53.280 --> 2:23:58.400\n arithmetic, set theory, all the serious models, theories in mathematics, they all have the feature\n\n2:23:58.400 --> 2:24:02.960\n that there are proofs of arbitrarily long length. In something like Boolean algebra,\n\n2:24:02.960 --> 2:24:07.680\n which is a decidable theory, there are, you know, any question in Boolean algebra, you can just go\n\n2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:13.360\n crunch, crunch, crunch, and in a known number of steps, you can answer it. You know, satisfiability,\n\n2:24:13.360 --> 2:24:17.840\n you know, might be hard, but it's still a bounded number of steps to answer any satisfiability\n\n2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:26.000\n problem. And so that's the notion of a black hole in physics where time stops. That's analogous to\n\n2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:32.640\n in mathematics where there aren't infinite length proofs, where when in physics, you know, you can\n\n2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:36.080\n wander around the universe forever if you don't run into a black hole. If you run into a black\n\n2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:41.760\n hole and time stops, you're done. And it's the same thing in mathematics between decidable\n\n2:24:41.760 --> 2:24:47.360\n theories and undecidable theories. That's an example. And I think where sort of the attempt\n\n2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:54.400\n to understand, so another question is kind of what is the general activity of metamathematics?\n\n2:24:54.400 --> 2:24:59.440\n What is the bulk theory of metamathematics? So in the literature of mathematics, there are about\n\n2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:05.040\n three million theorems that people have published. And those represent, it's kind of on this, it's\n\n2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:11.760\n like on the earth, we would be, you know, we've put cities in particular places on the earth,\n\n2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:15.440\n but yet there is ultimately, you know, we know the earth is roughly spherical,\n\n2:25:15.440 --> 2:25:20.640\n and there's an underlying space. And we could just talk about, you know, the world of space\n\n2:25:20.640 --> 2:25:24.720\n in terms of where our cities happen to be, but there's actually an underlying space. And so the\n\n2:25:24.720 --> 2:25:29.360\n question is, what's that for metamathematics? And as we kind of explore what is, for example,\n\n2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:34.640\n for mathematics, which is always likes taking sort of abstract limits. So an obvious abstract\n\n2:25:34.640 --> 2:25:40.480\n limit for mathematics to take is the limit of the future of mathematics. That is, what will be,\n\n2:25:40.480 --> 2:25:44.640\n you know, the ultimate structure of mathematics. And one of the things that's an empirical\n\n2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:49.520\n observation about mathematics that's quite interesting is that a lot of theories in one\n\n2:25:49.520 --> 2:25:54.560\n area of mathematics, algebraic geometry or something, might have, they play into another area\n\n2:25:54.560 --> 2:26:00.880\n of mathematics. That same kind of fundamental construct seemed to occur in very different\n\n2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:04.880\n areas of mathematics. And that's structurally captured a bit with category theory and things\n\n2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:09.760\n like that. But I think that there's probably an understanding of this metamathematical space that\n\n2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:15.200\n will explain why different areas of mathematics ultimately sort of map into the same thing.\n\n2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:21.840\n And I mean, you know, my little challenge to myself is what's time dilation in metamathematics?\n\n2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:27.440\n In other words, as you basically, as you move around in this mathematical space of possible\n\n2:26:27.440 --> 2:26:33.280\n statements, you know, how does that moving around? It's basically what's happening is\n\n2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:36.720\n that as you move around in the space of mathematical statements, it's like you're\n\n2:26:36.720 --> 2:26:42.080\n changing from algebra to geometry to whatever else. And you're trying to prove the same theorem.\n\n2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.960\n But as you try, if you keep on moving to these different places, it's slower to prove that\n\n2:26:46.960 --> 2:26:50.480\n theorem because you keep on having to translate what you're doing back to where you started from.\n\n2:26:50.480 --> 2:26:54.640\n And that's kind of the beginnings of the analog of time dilation in metamathematics.\n\n2:26:54.640 --> 2:26:57.440\n Plus, there's probably fractional dimensions in this space as well.\n\n2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:02.960\n Oh, this space is a very messy space. This space is much messier than physical space. I mean,\n\n2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:09.280\n even in the models of physics, physical space is very tame compared to branchial space and\n\n2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:14.160\n ruleal space. I mean, the mathematical structure, you know, branchial space is probably more like\n\n2:27:14.160 --> 2:27:20.480\n Hilbert space, but it's a rather complicated Hilbert space. And ruleal space is more like\n\n2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:25.520\n this weird infinity groupoid story of Grothendieck. And, you know, I can explain that a little bit\n\n2:27:25.520 --> 2:27:34.400\n because in metamathematical space, a path in metamathematical space is a path between two\n\n2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:39.920\n statements is a way to get by proofs, is a way to find a proof that goes from one statement to\n\n2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:45.360\n another. And so one of the things you can do, you can think about is between statements, you've got\n\n2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:50.560\n proofs and they are paths between statements. Okay, so now you can go to the next level and you\n\n2:27:50.560 --> 2:27:56.480\n can ask, what about a mapping from one proof to another? And so that's in category theory,\n\n2:27:56.480 --> 2:28:01.680\n that's kind of a higher category, the notion of higher categories where you're mapping not just\n\n2:28:03.280 --> 2:28:07.360\n between objects, but you're mapping between the mappings between objects and so on.\n\n2:28:07.360 --> 2:28:12.160\n And so you can keep doing that. You keep saying higher order proofs. I want mappings between\n\n2:28:12.160 --> 2:28:17.360\n proofs between proofs and so on. And that limiting structure, oh, by the way, one thing that's very\n\n2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:22.160\n interesting is imagine in proof space, you've got these two proofs. And the question is,\n\n2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:26.480\n what is the topology of proof space? In other words, if you take these two paths,\n\n2:28:26.480 --> 2:28:31.040\n can you continuously deform them into each other? Or is there some big hole in the middle that\n\n2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:35.040\n prevents you from continuously deforming them one into the other? It's kind of like, you know,\n\n2:28:35.040 --> 2:28:39.760\n when you think about some, I don't know, some puzzle, for example, you're moving pieces around\n\n2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:44.000\n on some puzzle, and you can think about the space of possible states of the puzzle.\n\n2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:47.680\n And you can make this graph that shows from one state of the puzzle to another state of\n\n2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.400\n the puzzle and so on. And sometimes you can easily get from one state to any other state,\n\n2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:56.720\n but sometimes there'll be a hole in that space. And there'll be, you know, you always have to\n\n2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:01.680\n go around the circuitous route to get from here to there. There won't be any direct way.\n\n2:29:01.680 --> 2:29:07.440\n That's kind of a question of whether there's sort of an obstruction in the space. And so the question\n\n2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:14.080\n is in proof space, what is the, what are, you know, what does it mean if there's an obstruction in proof\n\n2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:19.600\n space? Yeah, I don't even know what an obstruction means in proof space because for it to be an\n\n2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:25.040\n obstruction, it should be reachable some other way from some other place, right? So this is like\n\n2:29:25.040 --> 2:29:30.240\n an unreachable part of the graph. No, it's not just an unreachable part. It's a part where\n\n2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:34.240\n there are paths that go one way, there are paths that go the other way. And this question of\n\n2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:39.200\n homotopy in mathematics is this question, can you continuously deform, you know, from one path to\n\n2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:44.160\n another path or do you have to go in a jump, so to speak? So it's like if you're going around a\n\n2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:48.480\n sphere, for example, if you're going around, I don't know, a cylinder or something, you can\n\n2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:55.360\n wind around one way and you can, there's no paths where you can easily deform one path into another\n\n2:29:55.360 --> 2:29:58.960\n because it's just sort of sitting on the same side of the cylinder. But when you've got something\n\n2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:03.280\n that winds all the way around a cylinder, you can't continuously deform that down to a point\n\n2:30:03.280 --> 2:30:07.360\n because it's, it's stuck wrapped around. My intuition about proof spaces, you should be\n\n2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:10.880\n able to deform it. I mean that because then otherwise it doesn't even make sense because\n\n2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:17.200\n if the topology matters of the way you move about the space that I don't even know what that means.\n\n2:30:17.200 --> 2:30:22.320\n Well, what it would mean is that you would have one way of doing a proof of something over here\n\n2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:27.120\n in algebra and another way of doing a proof of something over here in geometry. And there would\n\n2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:32.800\n not be an intermediate way to map between those proofs. How would that be possible if they started\n\n2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:37.120\n the same place and ended the same place? Well, it's the same thing as, you know,\n\n2:30:37.120 --> 2:30:40.800\n we've got points on a, you know, if we've got paths on a cylinder.\n\n2:30:40.800 --> 2:30:44.320\n Now I understand how it works in physical space, but it just doesn't,\n\n2:30:44.320 --> 2:30:47.840\n it feels like proof space shouldn't have that. Okay. I mean,\n\n2:30:47.840 --> 2:30:52.160\n I'm not sure. I don't know. We'll know very soon because we get to do some experiments. This is\n\n2:30:52.160 --> 2:30:56.960\n the great thing about this stuff is that in fact, you know, in the next few days,\n\n2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:01.920\n I hope to do a bunch of experiments on this. So you're playing like proofs in this kind of space.\n\n2:31:01.920 --> 2:31:07.680\n Yes. Yes. I mean, so, you know, this is toy, you know, theories and, you know, we've got\n\n2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:13.200\n good. So this kind of segues to perhaps another thing, which is this whole idea of multi computation.\n\n2:31:13.200 --> 2:31:21.680\n So this is another kind of bigger idea that, so, okay, this has to do with how do you make models\n\n2:31:21.680 --> 2:31:28.880\n of things? And it's going to, so I've sort of claimed that there've been sort of four epochs\n\n2:31:28.880 --> 2:31:35.440\n in the history of making models of things. And this multi computation thing is the fourth,\n\n2:31:35.440 --> 2:31:41.520\n is a new epoch. What are the first three? The first one is back in antiquity, ancient Greek\n\n2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:46.480\n times. People were like, what's the universe made of? Oh, it's made of, you know, everything is\n\n2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:52.800\n water, Thales, you know, or everything is made of atoms. It's sort of, what are things made of?\n\n2:31:52.800 --> 2:31:58.080\n Or the, you know, there are these crystal spheres that represent where the planets are and so on.\n\n2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:03.120\n It's like a structural idea of how the universe is constructed. There's no real notion of dynamics.\n\n2:32:03.120 --> 2:32:08.720\n It's just, what is the universe? How is the universe made? Then we get to the 1600s and we\n\n2:32:08.720 --> 2:32:14.720\n get to the sort of revolution of mathematics being introduced into physics. And then we have this\n\n2:32:14.720 --> 2:32:21.120\n kind of idea of you write down some equation. The, what happens in the universe is the solving of\n\n2:32:21.120 --> 2:32:26.720\n that equation. Time enters, but it's usually just a parameter. We just can, you know, sort of slide\n\n2:32:26.720 --> 2:32:32.400\n it back and forth and say, here's where it is. Okay. Then we come to this kind of computational\n\n2:32:32.400 --> 2:32:39.120\n idea that I kind of started really pushing in the early 1980s as a result, you know,\n\n2:32:39.120 --> 2:32:43.280\n the things that we were talking about before about complexity, that was my motivation. But\n\n2:32:43.280 --> 2:32:48.160\n the bigger story was the story of kind of computational models of things. And the big\n\n2:32:48.160 --> 2:32:52.720\n difference there from the mathematical models is, in mathematical models, there's an equation,\n\n2:32:52.720 --> 2:32:58.160\n you solve it, you kind of slide time to the place where you want it. In computational models,\n\n2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:04.800\n you give the rule and then you just say, go run the rule. And time is not something you get to\n\n2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:11.440\n slide. Time is something where it just, you run the rule, time goes in steps. And that's how you\n\n2:33:11.440 --> 2:33:16.560\n work out how the system behaves. You don't, time is not just a parameter. Time is something that\n\n2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:21.920\n is about the running of these rules. And so there's this computational irreducibility. You can't jump\n\n2:33:21.920 --> 2:33:27.360\n ahead in time. But there's still, important thing is there's still one thread of time. It's still\n\n2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:31.360\n the case, you know, the cellular automaton state, then it has the next state and the next state and\n\n2:33:31.360 --> 2:33:36.400\n so on. The thing that is kind of, we've sort of tipped off by quantum mechanics in a sense,\n\n2:33:36.400 --> 2:33:41.760\n although it actually feeds back even into relativity and things like that, that there's\n\n2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:47.760\n these multiple threads of time. And so in this multi computation paradigm, the kind of idea is,\n\n2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:52.240\n instead of there being the single thread of time, there are these kind of distributed asynchronous\n\n2:33:52.240 --> 2:33:57.920\n threads of time that are happening. And the thing that's sort of different there is if you want to\n\n2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:02.480\n know what happened, if you say what happened in the system, in the case of the computational\n\n2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:08.880\n paradigm, you just say, well, after a thousand steps, we got this result, right? But in the\n\n2:34:08.880 --> 2:34:13.200\n multi computational paradigm, after a thousand steps, not even clear what a thousand steps means,\n\n2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:17.600\n because you've got all these different threads of time, but there is no state. There's all these\n\n2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:22.240\n different possible, you know, there's all these different paths. And so the only way you can know\n\n2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:27.280\n what happened is to have some kind of observer who is saying, here's how to parse the results\n\n2:34:27.280 --> 2:34:31.600\n of what was going on. Right. But that observer is embedded and they don't have a complete picture.\n\n2:34:31.600 --> 2:34:37.120\n So in the case of physics, that's right. Yes. And then in the, but that's, but so the idea is\n\n2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:42.320\n that in this multi computation setup, that it's this idea of these multiple threads of time\n\n2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:47.760\n and models that are based on that. And this is similar to what people think about in\n\n2:34:47.760 --> 2:34:52.400\n non deterministic computation. So you have a Turing machine. Usually it has a definite state. It\n\n2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:56.080\n follows another state, follows another state. But typically what people have done when they\n\n2:34:56.080 --> 2:34:59.760\n thought about these kinds of things is they've said, well, there are all these possible paths,\n\n2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:04.080\n and non deterministic Turing machine can follow all these possible paths, but we just want one\n\n2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:08.880\n of them. We just want the one that's the winner that factors the number or whatever else. And\n\n2:35:08.880 --> 2:35:13.520\n similarly, it's the same story in logic programming and so on, but we say, we've got this goal,\n\n2:35:13.520 --> 2:35:18.320\n find us a path to that goal. I just want one path, then I'm happy. Or theorem proving,\n\n2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:23.200\n same story. I just want one proof and then I'm happy. What's happening in multi computation\n\n2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:29.440\n in physics is we actually care about many paths. And well, there is a case, for example, probabilistic\n\n2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:33.920\n programming is a version of multi computation in which you're looking at all the paths. You're just\n\n2:35:33.920 --> 2:35:39.280\n asking for probabilities of things. But in a sense in physics, we're taking different kinds of\n\n2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:43.680\n samplings. For example, in quantum mechanics, we're taking a different kind of sampling\n\n2:35:43.680 --> 2:35:51.280\n of all these multiple paths. But the thing that is notable is that when you're an observer embedded\n\n2:35:51.280 --> 2:35:56.080\n in this thing, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, with various other sort of footnotes and so on,\n\n2:35:56.080 --> 2:36:02.400\n it is inevitable that the thing that you parse out of the system looks like general relativity\n\n2:36:02.400 --> 2:36:07.760\n and quantum mechanics. In other words, that just by the very structure of this multi computational\n\n2:36:07.760 --> 2:36:16.720\n setup, it inevitably is the case that you have certain emergent laws. Now, why is this perhaps\n\n2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:21.840\n not surprising? In thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, there are sort of inevitable emergent\n\n2:36:21.840 --> 2:36:28.320\n laws of sort of gas dynamics that are independent of the details of the molecular dynamics,\n\n2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:33.440\n sort of the same kind of thing. But I think what happens is what's a sort of a funny thing that I\n\n2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:39.200\n just been understanding very recently is when when I kind of introduced this whole sort of\n\n2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:44.880\n computational paradigm complexity ish thing back in the 80s, it was kind of like a big downer\n\n2:36:44.880 --> 2:36:48.160\n because it's like there's a lot of stuff you can't say about what systems will do.\n\n2:36:48.880 --> 2:36:52.800\n And then what I realized is and then you might say, now we've got multi computation, it's even\n\n2:36:52.800 --> 2:36:56.960\n worse. You know, it isn't just one thread of time that we can't explain. It's all these threads of\n\n2:36:56.960 --> 2:37:03.120\n time. It can't explain anything. But the following thing happens because there is all this\n\n2:37:03.120 --> 2:37:08.720\n irreducibility and any detailed thing you might want to answer, it's very hard to answer. But\n\n2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:13.760\n when you have an observer who has certain characteristics like computational boundedness,\n\n2:37:13.760 --> 2:37:19.920\n sequentiality of time and so on, that observer only samples certain aspects of this incredible\n\n2:37:19.920 --> 2:37:25.760\n complexity going on in this multi computational system. And that observer is sensitive only to\n\n2:37:25.760 --> 2:37:30.960\n to some underlying core structure of this multi computational system. There is all this\n\n2:37:30.960 --> 2:37:36.160\n irreducible computation going on, all these details. But to that kind of observer, what's\n\n2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:41.760\n important is only the core structure of multi computation, which means that observer\n\n2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:47.520\n observes comparatively simple laws. And I think it is inevitable that that observer\n\n2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:51.920\n observes laws which are mathematically structured like general relativity and quantum\n\n2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:56.240\n mechanics, which, by the way, are the same law in our in our model of physics.\n\n2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:01.920\n So that's an explanation why there are simple laws that explain a lot for this observer.\n\n2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:07.760\n Potentially, yes. But what the place where this gets really interesting is there are all these\n\n2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:12.480\n fields of science where people have kind of gotten stuck, where they say we'd really love to\n\n2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:16.800\n have a physics like theory of economics. We'd really love to have a physics like law and\n\n2:38:16.800 --> 2:38:22.560\n linguistics. You got to talk about molecular biology here. OK, so where where where does\n\n2:38:22.560 --> 2:38:27.040\n multi computation come in for biology? Economics is super interesting, too, but biology. OK,\n\n2:38:27.040 --> 2:38:31.760\n let's talk about that. So let's talk about chemistry for a second. OK, so I mean, I have\n\n2:38:31.760 --> 2:38:35.520\n to say, you know, this is it's such a weird business for me because, you know, there are\n\n2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:39.840\n these kind of paradigmatic ideas and then the actual applications. And it's like I've always\n\n2:38:39.840 --> 2:38:43.360\n said, I know nothing about chemistry. I learned all the chemistry I know, you know, the night\n\n2:38:43.360 --> 2:38:47.520\n before some exam when I was 14 years old. But I've actually learned a bunch more chemistry.\n\n2:38:47.520 --> 2:38:51.360\n And in Wolfram language these days, we have really pretty nice symbolic representation\n\n2:38:51.360 --> 2:38:55.760\n of chemistry. And in understanding the design of that, I've actually, I think, learned a certain\n\n2:38:55.760 --> 2:38:59.840\n amount of chemistry. So if you quizzed me on sort of basic high school chemistry, I would\n\n2:38:59.840 --> 2:39:06.000\n probably totally fail. But but but OK, so what is chemistry? I mean, chemistry is sort of a\n\n2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:11.200\n story of, you know, chemical reactions are like you've got this particular chemical that's\n\n2:39:11.200 --> 2:39:15.840\n represented as some graph of, you know, these are these are this configuration of molecules\n\n2:39:15.840 --> 2:39:20.480\n with these bonds and so on. And a chemical reaction happens. You've got these sort of\n\n2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:24.720\n two graphs. They interact in some way. You've got another graph or multiple other graphs\n\n2:39:24.720 --> 2:39:30.560\n out. So that's kind of the sort of the the abstract view of what's happening in chemistry.\n\n2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:36.000\n And so when you do a chemical synthesis, for example, you are given certain sort of these\n\n2:39:36.000 --> 2:39:40.640\n are possible reactions that can happen. And you're asked, can you piece together this\n\n2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:45.120\n sequence of such reactions, a sequence of such sort of axiomatic reactions usually called name\n\n2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:50.640\n reactions in chemistry? Can you piece together a sequence of these reactions so that you get out\n\n2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:55.040\n at the end this great molecule you were trying to synthesize? And so that's a story very much\n\n2:39:55.040 --> 2:40:00.160\n like theorem proving. And people have done actually they start in the 1960s looking at\n\n2:40:00.720 --> 2:40:04.960\n kind of the theorem proving approach to that, although it didn't really it didn't it didn't\n\n2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:09.920\n was sort of done too early, I think. But anyway, so that's kind of the view is that that chemistry,\n\n2:40:09.920 --> 2:40:15.520\n chemical reactions are the story of of all these different sort of paths of possible things that\n\n2:40:15.520 --> 2:40:22.640\n go on. OK, let's let's go to an even lower level. Let's say instead of asking about which species\n\n2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:26.880\n of molecules we're talking about, let's look at individual molecules and let's say we're looking\n\n2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:31.120\n at individual molecules and they are having chemical reactions and we're building up this\n\n2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:36.000\n big graph of all these reactions that are happening. OK, so so then we've got this big\n\n2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:41.760\n graph. And by the way, that big graph is incredibly similar to this hypergraph rewriting things.\n\n2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:46.880\n In fact, in the underlying theory of multi computation there, these things we call token\n\n2:40:46.880 --> 2:40:52.640\n event graphs, which are basically you've broken your state into tokens. Like in the case of a\n\n2:40:52.640 --> 2:40:58.160\n hypergraph, you've broken it into hyper edges and each event is just consuming some number of tokens\n\n2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:02.320\n and producing some number of tokens. But then you have to there's a lot of work to be done\n\n2:41:02.320 --> 2:41:08.400\n on update rules in terms of what they actually are for chemistry. Yeah, what they offer are\n\n2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:12.880\n observed chemistry. Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. And we've been working on that actually because we\n\n2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:17.360\n have this beautiful system and Wolfram language for representing chemistry symbolically. So we\n\n2:41:17.360 --> 2:41:21.440\n actually have you know, this is this is an ongoing thing to actually figure out what they are for\n\n2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:26.480\n some practical cases. Does that require human injection or can it be automatically discovered\n\n2:41:27.040 --> 2:41:30.960\n these update rules? Well, if we can do chemistry better, we could probably discover them\n\n2:41:30.960 --> 2:41:35.600\n automatically. But I think in, in reality, right now, it's like there are these particular\n\n2:41:35.600 --> 2:41:39.840\n reactions. And really, to understand what's going on, we're probably going to pick a particular\n\n2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:45.440\n subtype of chemistry. And just because because let me explain where this is going to the place\n\n2:41:45.440 --> 2:41:50.880\n that his his where this is going. So got this whole network of all these molecules,\n\n2:41:50.880 --> 2:41:56.560\n having all these reactions and so on. And this is some whole multi computational story because each\n\n2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:02.560\n each sort of chemical reaction event is its own separate event. We're saying they will happen\n\n2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:07.120\n asynchronously. We're not describing in what order they happen. You know, maybe that order is governed\n\n2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:11.280\n by some quantum mechanics thing doesn't really matter. We're just saying they happen in some\n\n2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:16.720\n order. And then we ask, what is the what what's the you know, how do we think about the system?\n\n2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:21.600\n Well, this thing is some kind of big multi computational system. The question is what is\n\n2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:27.120\n the chemical observer? And one possible chemical observer is all you care about is did you make\n\n2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:31.600\n that particular drug molecule? You're just asking, you know, the for the one path. Another thing you\n\n2:42:31.600 --> 2:42:36.960\n might care about is I want to know the concentration of each species. I want to know,\n\n2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:40.960\n you know, at every stage, I'm going to solve the differential equations that represent the\n\n2:42:40.960 --> 2:42:46.240\n concentrations. And I want to know what those all are. But there's more. Because when and it's kind\n\n2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:51.760\n of like you're going below and statistical mechanics, there's kind of all these molecules\n\n2:42:51.760 --> 2:42:57.120\n bouncing around. And you might say, we're just going to ignore we're just going to look at the\n\n2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:02.080\n aggregate densities of certain kinds of molecules. But you can look at a lower level, you can look\n\n2:43:02.080 --> 2:43:08.480\n at this whole graph of possible interactions. And so the kind of the idea would be what, you know,\n\n2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:14.240\n is the only chemical observer, one who just cares about overall concentrations? Or can there be a\n\n2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:20.880\n chemical observer who cares about this network of what happened? And so that the question then is,\n\n2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:25.440\n so let me give an analogy. So this is where I think this is potentially very relevant to molecular\n\n2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:32.000\n biology and molecular computing. When we think about a computation, usually, we say it's input,\n\n2:43:32.000 --> 2:43:36.320\n it's output, we, you know, or chemistry, we say there's this input, we're going to make this\n\n2:43:36.320 --> 2:43:42.960\n molecule as the output. But what if what we actually encode, what if our computation, what\n\n2:43:42.960 --> 2:43:48.160\n thing we care about is some part of this dynamic network? What if it isn't just the input and the\n\n2:43:48.160 --> 2:43:52.320\n output that we care about? What if there's some dynamics of the network that we care about? Now,\n\n2:43:52.320 --> 2:43:57.840\n imagine you're a chemical observer, what is a chemical observer? Well, in molecular biology,\n\n2:43:57.840 --> 2:44:03.280\n there are all kinds of weird sorts of observers, there are membranes that exist, that have, you\n\n2:44:03.280 --> 2:44:08.080\n know, different kinds of molecules that can bind to them, things like this, it's not obvious that\n\n2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:13.760\n the from a human scale, we just measure the concentration of something is the relevant story.\n\n2:44:13.760 --> 2:44:18.480\n We can imagine that, for example, when we look at this whole network of possible reactions,\n\n2:44:18.480 --> 2:44:22.640\n we can imagine, you know, at a physical level, we can imagine, well, what was the actual momentum\n\n2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:26.880\n direction of that of that molecule? What was it which we don't pay any attention to when we're\n\n2:44:26.880 --> 2:44:31.040\n just talking about chemical concentrations? What was the orientation of that molecule,\n\n2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:36.800\n these kinds of things? And so here's the place where I'm, I have a little suspicion, okay? So\n\n2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:41.600\n one of the questions in biology is what matters in biology? And that is, you know, we have all\n\n2:44:41.600 --> 2:44:46.640\n these chemical reactions, we have all these, all these molecular processes going on in, you know,\n\n2:44:46.640 --> 2:44:52.720\n in biological systems, what matters? And, you know, one of the things is to be able to tell\n\n2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:57.600\n what matters, well, so a big story of the what matters question was what happened in genetics\n\n2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:03.040\n in 1953, when DNA, when it was figured out how DNA worked. Because before that time, you know,\n\n2:45:03.040 --> 2:45:07.440\n genetics have been all these different effects and complicated things. And then it was realized,\n\n2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:12.480\n ah, there's something new, a molecule can store information, which wasn't obvious before that\n\n2:45:12.480 --> 2:45:17.040\n time, a single molecule can store information. So there's a place where there can be something\n\n2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:21.760\n important that's happening in molecular biology, and it's just in the sequence that's storing\n\n2:45:21.760 --> 2:45:28.720\n information in a molecule. So the possibility now is imagine this dynamic network, this, you know,\n\n2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:33.920\n causal graphs and multiway causal graphs and so on, that represent all of these different reactions\n\n2:45:33.920 --> 2:45:39.360\n between molecules. What if there is some aspect of that, that is storing information that's relevant\n\n2:45:39.360 --> 2:45:45.120\n for molecular biology? And the dynamic aspect of that. Yes, that's right. So that it's similar to\n\n2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:50.480\n how the structure of a DNA molecule stores information, it could be the dynamics of the\n\n2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:56.800\n system somehow stores information. And this kind of process might allow you to give predictions\n\n2:45:56.800 --> 2:46:03.360\n of what that would be. Well, yes, but also imagine that you're trying to do, for example, imagine\n\n2:46:03.360 --> 2:46:08.240\n you're trying to do molecular computation. Okay. You might think the way we're going to do molecular\n\n2:46:08.240 --> 2:46:11.600\n computation is we're just going to run the thing. We're going to see what came out. We're going to\n\n2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:16.960\n see what molecule came out. This is saying that's not the only thing you can do. There is a different\n\n2:46:16.960 --> 2:46:22.240\n kind of chemical observer that you can imagine constructing, which is somehow sensitive to this\n\n2:46:22.240 --> 2:46:27.360\n dynamic network. Exactly how that works, how we make that measurement, I don't know, but a few\n\n2:46:27.360 --> 2:46:33.200\n ideas, but that's what's important, so to speak. And that means, and by the way, you can do the\n\n2:46:33.200 --> 2:46:39.040\n same thing even for Turing machines. You can say, if you have a multiway Turing machine, you can say,\n\n2:46:39.040 --> 2:46:43.600\n how do you compute with a multiway Turing machine? You can't say, well, we've got this input and this\n\n2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:48.640\n output because the thing has all these threads of time and it's got lots of outputs. And so then you\n\n2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:53.200\n say, well, what does it even mean to be a universal multiway Turing machine? I don't fully know the\n\n2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:59.200\n answer to that. It's an interesting idea. It would freak Turing out for sure, because then the\n\n2:46:59.200 --> 2:47:05.840\n dynamics of the trajectory of the computation matters. Yes. Yes. I mean, but the thing is\n\n2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:10.560\n that that, so this is again, a story of what's the observer, so to speak. In chemistry, what's\n\n2:47:10.560 --> 2:47:16.480\n the observer there? Now to give an example of where that might matter, a very sort of present\n\n2:47:16.480 --> 2:47:23.840\n day example is in immunology, where we have whatever it is, 10 billion different kinds of\n\n2:47:23.840 --> 2:47:29.680\n antibodies that are all these different shapes and so on. We have a trillion different kinds of T\n\n2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:37.120\n cell receptors that we produce. And the traditional theory of immunology is this clonal\n\n2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:42.320\n selection theory where we are constantly producing, randomly producing all these different antibodies.\n\n2:47:42.320 --> 2:47:46.880\n And as soon as one of them binds to an antigen, then that one gets amplified and we produce more\n\n2:47:46.880 --> 2:47:53.920\n of that antibody and so on. Back in the 1960s, an immunologist called Nils Joerner, who was the guy\n\n2:47:53.920 --> 2:47:59.520\n who invented monoclonal antibodies, various other things, kind of had this network theory of the\n\n2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:04.240\n immune system where it would be like, well, we produce antibodies, but then we produce antibodies\n\n2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:09.120\n to the antibodies, anti antibodies, and we produce anti anti antibodies. And we get this whole dynamic\n\n2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:16.400\n network of interactions between different immune system cells. And that was kind of a qualitative\n\n2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:21.360\n theory at that time. And I've been a little disappointed because I've been studying immunology\n\n2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:26.080\n a bit recently. And I knew something about this like 35 years ago or something. And I knew,\n\n2:48:26.080 --> 2:48:29.280\n you know, I'd read a bunch of the books and I talked to a bunch of the people and so on.\n\n2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:35.280\n And it was like an emerging theoretical immunology world. And then I look at the books now,\n\n2:48:35.280 --> 2:48:39.760\n and they're very thick because they've got, you know, there's just a ton known about immunology\n\n2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:43.680\n and, you know, all these different pathways, all these different details and so on.\n\n2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:51.440\n But the theoretical sections seem to have shrunk. And so it's so the question is, what, you know,\n\n2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:55.680\n for example, immune memory, where is the where does the immune memory reside? Is it actually\n\n2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:59.920\n some cells sitting in our bone marrow that is, you know, living for the whole of our lives that's\n\n2:48:59.920 --> 2:49:05.120\n going to spring into action as soon as we're shown the same antigen? Or is it something different\n\n2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:09.520\n from that? Is it something more dynamic? Is it something more like some network of interactions\n\n2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:14.000\n between these different kinds of immune system cells and so on? And it's known that there are\n\n2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:19.040\n plenty of interactions between T cells and, you know, there's plenty of dynamics. But what the\n\n2:49:19.040 --> 2:49:24.880\n consequence of that dynamics is, is not clear. And to have a qualitative theory for that doesn't\n\n2:49:25.840 --> 2:49:30.240\n seem to exist. In fact, I was just been trying to study this. So I'm quite incomplete in my study\n\n2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:34.320\n of these things. But I was a little bit taken aback because I've been looking at these things\n\n2:49:34.320 --> 2:49:37.680\n and it's like, and then they get to the end where they have the most advanced theory that they've\n\n2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:43.920\n got. And it turns out it's a cellular automaton theory. It's like, okay, well, at least I understand\n\n2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:52.160\n that theory. But but, you know, I think that the possibility is that in that this is a place where\n\n2:49:52.160 --> 2:49:56.720\n if you want to know, you know, explain roughly how the immune system works, it ends up being\n\n2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:02.240\n this sort of dynamic network. And then the the, you know, the immune consciousness, so to speak,\n\n2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:06.960\n the observer ends up being something that, you know, in the end, it's kind of like, does the\n\n2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:12.080\n human get sick or whatever? But it's a it's something which is a complicated story that\n\n2:50:12.080 --> 2:50:16.800\n relates to this whole sort of dynamic network and so on. And I think that's another place where this\n\n2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:23.040\n kind of notion of where I think multi computation has the possibility. See, one of the things, okay,\n\n2:50:23.040 --> 2:50:27.520\n you can end up with something where yes, there is a general relativity in there. But it turns up,\n\n2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:33.360\n but it may turn out that the observer who sees general relativity in the immune system is an\n\n2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:37.600\n observer that's irrelevant to what we care about about the immune system. I mean, it could be yes,\n\n2:50:37.600 --> 2:50:43.280\n there is some effect where, you know, there's some, you know, time dilation of T cells interacting\n\n2:50:43.280 --> 2:50:47.600\n with whatever. But it's like, that's an effect that's just irrelevant. And the thing we actually\n\n2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:52.880\n care about is things about, you know, what happens when you have a vaccine that goes into some place\n\n2:50:52.880 --> 2:50:57.760\n in shapespace? And, you know, how does that affect other places in shapespace? And how does that spread?\n\n2:50:57.760 --> 2:51:01.840\n You know, what's the what's the analog of the speed of light in shapespace, for example, that's an\n\n2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:06.160\n that's an important issue. If you have one of these dynamic theories, it's like, you know, you\n\n2:51:06.160 --> 2:51:10.400\n you're poking to shapespace by having, you know, let's say, a vaccine or something that has a\n\n2:51:10.400 --> 2:51:16.960\n particular configuration in shapespace. How, how quickly as this dynamic network spreads out, how\n\n2:51:16.960 --> 2:51:22.160\n quickly do you get sort of other antibodies in different places in shapespace, things like that?\n\n2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:26.560\n When you say shapespace, you mean the shape of the molecules? And then, so this is like,\n\n2:51:27.520 --> 2:51:31.440\n could be deeply connected to the protein and multi protein folding, all of that kind of stuff.\n\n2:51:32.080 --> 2:51:36.240\n To be able to say something interesting about the the dance of proteins that\n\n2:51:36.240 --> 2:51:36.960\n Right, exactly.\n\n2:51:36.960 --> 2:51:44.160\n then actually has an impact on helping develop drugs, for example, or has an impact on\n\n2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:46.800\n virology, immunology, helping.\n\n2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:54.080\n Well, I think the big thing is, you know, when we think about molecular biology, the you know,\n\n2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:58.640\n what, what is the qualitative way to think about it? You know, in other words, is it chemical\n\n2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:05.920\n reaction networks? Is it, you know, genetics, you know, DNA, big, you know, big news, it's kind of\n\n2:52:05.920 --> 2:52:10.800\n there's a digital aspect to the whole thing. You know, what is the qualitative way to think about\n\n2:52:10.800 --> 2:52:15.200\n how things work in biology? You know, when we think about, I don't know, some phenomenon like\n\n2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:18.880\n aging or something, which is a big, complicated phenomenon, which just seems to have all these\n\n2:52:18.880 --> 2:52:23.600\n different tentacles. Is it really the case that that can be thought about in some, you know,\n\n2:52:23.600 --> 2:52:29.040\n without DNA, when people were describing, you know, genetic phenomena, there were, you know,\n\n2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:33.680\n dominant recessive, this, that and the other got very, very complicated. And then people realize,\n\n2:52:33.680 --> 2:52:38.400\n oh, it's just, you know, and what is a gene and so on and so on and so on. Then people realize\n\n2:52:38.400 --> 2:52:42.480\n it's just base pairs. And there's this digital representation. And so the question is, what is\n\n2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:47.200\n the overarching representation that we can now start to think about using a molecular biology?\n\n2:52:47.200 --> 2:52:51.920\n I don't know how this will work out. And this is again, one of these things where, and the place\n\n2:52:51.920 --> 2:52:58.000\n where that gets important is, you know, maybe molecular biology is doing molecular computing\n\n2:52:58.000 --> 2:53:03.760\n by using some dynamic process that is something where it is very happily saying, oh, I just got\n\n2:53:03.760 --> 2:53:07.680\n a result. It's in the dynamic structure of this network. Now I'm going to go and do some other\n\n2:53:07.680 --> 2:53:12.320\n thing based on that result, for example. But we're like, oh, I don't know what's going on. You know,\n\n2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:17.520\n it's just, we just measured the levels of these chemicals and we couldn't conclude anything.\n\n2:53:17.520 --> 2:53:22.880\n But it just, we're looking at the wrong thing. And so that's the, that's kind of the potential\n\n2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:30.080\n there. And it's, I mean, these things are, I don't know, it's for me, it's like, I've not really,\n\n2:53:30.080 --> 2:53:34.400\n that was not a view. I mean, I've thought about molecular computing for ages and ages and ages.\n\n2:53:34.400 --> 2:53:40.400\n And I've always imagined that the big story is kind of the original promise of nanotechnology\n\n2:53:40.400 --> 2:53:45.920\n of like, can we make a molecular scale constructor that will just build a molecule in any shape?\n\n2:53:45.920 --> 2:53:50.880\n I don't think I'm now increasingly concluding that's not the big point. The big point is\n\n2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:56.000\n something more dynamic. That will be an interesting endpoint for any of these things. But that's\n\n2:53:56.000 --> 2:54:00.160\n perhaps not the thing, you know, because the one example we have in molecular computing\n\n2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:05.840\n that's really working is us biological organisms. And, you know, maybe the thing that's important\n\n2:54:05.840 --> 2:54:10.880\n there is not this, you know, what chemicals do you make, so to speak, but more this kind of\n\n2:54:10.880 --> 2:54:15.440\n dynamic process. The dynamic process. And then you can have a good model like the hypergraph to then\n\n2:54:15.440 --> 2:54:22.640\n explore what, like simulate again, make predictions. And if they, I think just have a way to reason\n\n2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:28.160\n about biology. I mean, it's hard, you know, but first of all, biology doesn't have theories like\n\n2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:34.080\n physics. You know, physics is a much more successful sort of global theory kind of area.\n\n2:54:34.080 --> 2:54:39.120\n You know, biology, what are the global theories of biology? Pretty much Darwinian evolution. That's\n\n2:54:39.120 --> 2:54:43.440\n the only global theory of biology. You know, are there any other theories just say, well,\n\n2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:47.840\n the kidneys work this way, this thing works this way and so on. There isn't, I suppose,\n\n2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:52.640\n another global theory is digital information in DNA. That's another sort of global fact about\n\n2:54:52.640 --> 2:55:00.400\n biology. But the difficult thing to do is to match something you have a model of in the hypergraph\n\n2:55:00.400 --> 2:55:05.120\n to the actual, like how do you discover the theory? How do you discover the theory? Okay,\n\n2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:10.080\n you have something that looks nice and makes sense, but like you have to match it to validation.\n\n2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:14.320\n Oh, sure. Right. And that's tricky because you're walking around in the dark.\n\n2:55:15.280 --> 2:55:20.320\n Not entirely. I mean, so, you know, for example, in what we've been trying to think about is\n\n2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:26.960\n take actual chemical reactions. Okay. So, you know, one of my goals is can I compute the primes\n\n2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:33.200\n with molecules? Okay. If I can do that, then I kind of, maybe I can compute things. And, you know,\n\n2:55:33.200 --> 2:55:37.520\n there's this nice automated lab, these guys, these Emerald Cloud Lab people have built with\n\n2:55:37.520 --> 2:55:42.000\n Wolfram language and so on. That's an actual physical lab and you send it a piece of Wolfram\n\n2:55:42.000 --> 2:55:47.760\n language code and it goes and, you know, actually does physical experiments. And so one of my goals,\n\n2:55:47.760 --> 2:55:52.880\n because I'm not a test tube kind of guy, I'm more of a software kind of person, is can I make\n\n2:55:52.880 --> 2:55:57.840\n something where, you know, in this automated lab, we can actually get it so that there's some gel\n\n2:55:57.840 --> 2:56:02.720\n that we made and, you know, the positions of the stripes are the primes. I love it. Yeah.\n\n2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:08.720\n I mean, that would be an example of where, and that would be with a particular, you know,\n\n2:56:08.720 --> 2:56:13.120\n framework for actually doing the molecular computing, you know, with particular kinds\n\n2:56:13.120 --> 2:56:18.000\n of molecules. And there's a lot of kind of ambient technological mess, so to speak,\n\n2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:22.240\n associated with, oh, is it carbon? Is it this? Is it that? You know, is it important that there's\n\n2:56:22.240 --> 2:56:26.240\n a bromine atom here, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is all chemistry that I don't know\n\n2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:32.000\n much about. And, you know, that's a sort of, you know, unfortunately that's down at the level,\n\n2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:36.080\n you know, I would like to be at the software level, not at the level of the transistors,\n\n2:56:36.080 --> 2:56:40.560\n so to speak. But in chemistry, you know, there's a certain amount we have to do, I think, at the\n\n2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:45.280\n level of transistors before we get up to being able to do it. Although, you know, the automated\n\n2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:52.400\n labs certainly help in setting that up. I talked to a guy named Charles Hoskinson.\n\n2:56:52.960 --> 2:56:58.640\n He mentioned that he's collaborating with you. He's an interesting guy. He sends me papers on\n\n2:56:58.640 --> 2:57:04.160\n speaking of automated theorem proving a lot. He's exceptionally well read on that area as well.\n\n2:57:04.160 --> 2:57:08.240\n So what's the nature of your collaboration with him? He's the creator of Cardano.\n\n2:57:08.240 --> 2:57:13.680\n What's the nature of the collaboration between Cardano and the whole space of blockchain and\n\n2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:19.200\n Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha, Wolfram blockchain, all that kind of stuff? Well, OK, we're segueing to a\n\n2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:26.240\n slightly different world. But so although not completely unconnected. Right. The whole thing\n\n2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:31.520\n is somehow connected. I know. I mean, you know, the strange thing in my life is I've sort of\n\n2:57:31.520 --> 2:57:36.960\n alternated between doing basic science and doing technology about five times in my life so far.\n\n2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:42.160\n And the thing that's just crazy about it is, you know, every time I do one of these alternations,\n\n2:57:42.160 --> 2:57:46.160\n I think there's not going to be a way back to the other thing. And like I thought for this\n\n2:57:46.160 --> 2:57:50.640\n physics project, I thought, you know, we're doing fundamental theory of physics. Maybe it'll have\n\n2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:57.840\n an application in 200 years. But now I've realized actually this multi computation idea is is\n\n2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:03.440\n applicable here now. It's and in fact, it's also giving us this way. I'll just mention one other\n\n2:58:03.440 --> 2:58:11.040\n thing and then talk about blockchain. The the question of actually that relates to several\n\n2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:18.960\n different things. But but one of the things about about OK, so our Wolfram language, which is our\n\n2:58:18.960 --> 2:58:23.200\n attempt to kind of represent everything in the world computationally. And it's the thing I kind\n\n2:58:23.200 --> 2:58:29.760\n of started building 40 years ago in the form of actual Wolfram language 35 years ago. It's kind\n\n2:58:29.760 --> 2:58:37.520\n of this idea of can we can we express things about the world in computational terms? And, you know,\n\n2:58:37.520 --> 2:58:42.000\n we've come a long way in being able to do that. Wolfram Alpha is kind of the consumer version of\n\n2:58:42.000 --> 2:58:46.800\n that where you're just using natural language as input. The and it turns it into our symbolic\n\n2:58:46.800 --> 2:58:51.520\n language. And that's, you know, the symbolic language Wolfram language is what people use\n\n2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:56.160\n and have been using for the last 33 years. Actually, Mathematica, which is its first\n\n2:58:56.160 --> 2:59:05.360\n instantiation, will be one third of a century old in in October. And that it's it's kind of\n\n2:59:05.360 --> 2:59:09.920\n interesting. What do you mean one third of a century? I mean, 33 or 30? What are we? 33 and a\n\n2:59:09.920 --> 2:59:17.440\n third. 33 and a third. So I've never heard of anyone celebrating that anniversary, but I like\n\n2:59:17.440 --> 2:59:22.000\n it. I know. A third of a century, though, it's it's kind of get many, many slices of a century\n\n2:59:22.000 --> 2:59:26.240\n that are interesting. But but, you know, I think that the the thing that's really striking about\n\n2:59:26.240 --> 2:59:30.640\n that is that means, you know, including the whole sort of technology stack I built around that's\n\n2:59:30.640 --> 2:59:34.480\n about 40 years old. And that means it's a significant fraction of the total age of the\n\n2:59:34.480 --> 2:59:39.360\n computer industry. And it's I mean, I think it's cool that we can still run, you know,\n\n2:59:39.360 --> 2:59:44.960\n Mathematica version one programs today and so on. And we've sort of maintained compatibility.\n\n2:59:44.960 --> 2:59:49.760\n And we've been just building this big tower all those years of just more and more and more\n\n2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:53.120\n computational capabilities. It's sort of interesting. We just made this this picture\n\n2:59:54.160 --> 2:59:59.280\n of kind of the different kind of threads of of of computational content, of, you know,\n\n2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:05.360\n mathematical content and and, you know, all sorts of things with, you know, data and graphs and\n\n3:00:05.360 --> 3:00:10.160\n whatever else. And what you see in this picture is about the first 10 years. It's kind of like\n\n3:00:10.160 --> 3:00:16.160\n it's just a few threads. And then then about maybe 15, 20 years ago, it kind of explodes\n\n3:00:16.160 --> 3:00:20.400\n in this whole collection, different threads of all these different capabilities that are now\n\n3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:25.760\n part of open language and representing different things in the world. But the thing that was super\n\n3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:31.840\n lucky in some sense is it's all based on one idea. It's all based on the idea of symbolic expressions\n\n3:00:31.840 --> 3:00:36.240\n and transformation rules for symbolic expressions, which was kind of what I originally\n\n3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:42.880\n put into this SMP system back in 1979 that was a predecessor of the whole open language stack.\n\n3:00:42.880 --> 3:00:48.880\n So that idea was an idea that I got from sort of trying to understand mathematical logic and so on.\n\n3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:54.880\n It was my attempt to kind of make a general human comprehensible model of computation\n\n3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:59.440\n of just everything is a symbolic expression. And all you do is transform symbolic expressions.\n\n3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:06.960\n And, you know, in in retrospect, I was very lucky that I understood as little as I understood then,\n\n3:01:06.960 --> 3:01:11.520\n because had I understood more, I would have been completely freaked out about all the different\n\n3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:17.680\n ways that that kind of model can can fail. Because what do you do when you have a symbolic\n\n3:01:17.680 --> 3:01:22.320\n expression, you make transformations for symbolic expressions? Well, for example, one question is,\n\n3:01:22.320 --> 3:01:26.800\n there may be many transformations that could be made in a very multi computational kind of way.\n\n3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:30.400\n But what we're doing is picking, we're using the first transformation\n\n3:01:30.400 --> 3:01:35.840\n that applies. And we keep doing that until we reach a fixed point. And that's the result. And\n\n3:01:35.840 --> 3:01:42.080\n that's kind of a very, it's kind of a way of sort of sliding around the edge of multi computation.\n\n3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:46.800\n And back when I was working on SMP and things, I actually thought about these questions about\n\n3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:52.560\n about how, you know, how, what determines the this kind of evaluation path. So for example,\n\n3:01:52.560 --> 3:01:57.040\n you know, you work out Fibonacci, you know, Fibonacci is a recursive thing, f of n is f of\n\n3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:02.000\n n minus one plus f of n minus two, and you get this whole tree of recursion, right? And there's\n\n3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:06.400\n the question of how do you evaluate that tree of recursion? Do you do it sort of depth first,\n\n3:02:06.400 --> 3:02:10.640\n where you go all the way down one side? Do you do it breadth first, where you're kind of collecting\n\n3:02:10.640 --> 3:02:14.640\n the terms together, where you know that, you know, f of eight plus f of seven, f of seven,\n\n3:02:14.640 --> 3:02:20.160\n plus f of six, you can collect the f of sevens, and so on. These are, you know, I didn't realize\n\n3:02:20.160 --> 3:02:25.040\n that at the time, it's kind of funny, I was working on on gauge field theories back in 1979.\n\n3:02:25.040 --> 3:02:31.280\n And I was also working on the evaluation model in SMP. And they're the same problem. But it took me\n\n3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:37.120\n 40 more years to realize that. And this question about how you do this sort of evaluation front,\n\n3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:42.640\n that's a question of reference frames. It's a question of kind of the story of I mean,\n\n3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:47.680\n that that's, that is basically this question of, in what order is the universe evaluated?\n\n3:02:48.240 --> 3:02:52.960\n And that's, and so what you realize is, there's this whole sort of world of different kinds of\n\n3:02:52.960 --> 3:02:57.440\n computation that you can do, sort of multi computationally. And that's a, that's an\n\n3:02:57.440 --> 3:03:01.680\n interesting thing. It has a lot of implications for distributed computing, and so on. It also has\n\n3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:06.400\n a potential implication for blockchain, which we haven't fully worked out, which is, and this is\n\n3:03:06.400 --> 3:03:13.040\n not what we're doing with Cardano, but but this is a different thing. The this is something where\n\n3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:19.840\n one of the questions is, when you have, in a sense, blockchain is a deeply sequentialized\n\n3:03:19.840 --> 3:03:26.000\n story of time. Because in blockchain, there's just one copy of the ledger. And you're saying,\n\n3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:29.760\n this is what happened, you know, time has progressed in this way. And there are little\n\n3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:34.880\n things around the edges, as you try and reach consensus and so on. And, and, you know, actually,\n\n3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:39.920\n we just recently, we've had this little conference we organized about the theory of distributed\n\n3:03:39.920 --> 3:03:44.160\n consensus, because I realized that a bunch of interesting things that some of our science can\n\n3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:48.000\n tell one about that. But that's a different let's let's not go down that that part. Yeah,\n\n3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:51.520\n but distributed consensus that still has a sequential there's like, there's still\n\n3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:57.360\n sequentiality. So don't tell me you're thinking through like how to apply multi computation to\n\n3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:04.960\n blockchain. Yes. And so so that becomes a story of, you know, instead of transactions all having\n\n3:04:04.960 --> 3:04:10.320\n to settle in one ledger, it's like a story of all these different ledgers. And they all have to have\n\n3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:15.120\n some ultimate consistency, which is what causal invariance would give one, but it can take a\n\n3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:19.920\n while. And the it can take a while is kind of like quantum mechanics. So it's kind of what's\n\n3:04:19.920 --> 3:04:25.280\n happening is there these different paths of history that correspond to, you know, in one path\n\n3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:29.760\n of history, you got paid this amount in another path of history, you got paid this amount. In the\n\n3:04:29.760 --> 3:04:36.240\n end, the universe will always become consistent. Now, now the way it will it works is, okay, it's\n\n3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:40.400\n a little bit more complicated than that. What happens is, the way space is knitted together\n\n3:04:40.400 --> 3:04:47.040\n in our theory of physics is through all these events. And the the idea is that the way that\n\n3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:52.880\n economic space is knitted together is between is there these autonomous events that essentially\n\n3:04:52.880 --> 3:04:57.520\n knit together economic space. So there are all these threads of transactions that are happening.\n\n3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:01.760\n And the question is, can they be made consistent? Are there is there something forcing them to be\n\n3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:08.240\n sort of a consistent fabric of economic reality? And sort of what this has led me to is trying to\n\n3:05:08.240 --> 3:05:14.640\n realize how does economics fundamentally work? And, you know, what is economics? And, you know,\n\n3:05:14.640 --> 3:05:20.720\n what what are the atoms of economics, so to speak? And so what I've kind of realized is that, that\n\n3:05:20.720 --> 3:05:25.920\n sort of the perhaps I don't even know if this is right yet, there's sort of events in economics,\n\n3:05:25.920 --> 3:05:32.240\n the transactions, there are states of agents that are kind of the atoms of economics. And then\n\n3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:38.720\n transactions are kind of agents transact in some transact in some way, and that's an event. And\n\n3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:43.920\n then the question is, how do you knit together sort of economic space from that? What is there\n\n3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:48.160\n in economic space? Well, all these transactions, there's a whole complicated collection of possible\n\n3:05:48.160 --> 3:05:52.720\n transactions. But one thing that's true about economics is we tend to have the notion of a\n\n3:05:52.720 --> 3:06:01.840\n definite value for things. We could imagine that, you know, you buy a cookie from somebody, and\n\n3:06:02.480 --> 3:06:09.040\n they want to get a movie ticket. And there is some way that AI bots could make some path\n\n3:06:09.680 --> 3:06:16.000\n from the cookie to the movie ticket by all these different intermediate transactions. But in fact,\n\n3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:21.600\n we have an approximation to that, which is we say they each have a dollar value. And we have this\n\n3:06:21.600 --> 3:06:28.240\n kind of numeraire concept of there's just a way of kind of taking this whole complicated space of\n\n3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:34.560\n transactions and parsing it in something which is a kind of a simplified thing that is kind of like\n\n3:06:34.560 --> 3:06:41.920\n our parsing of physical space. And so my guess is that the yet again, I mean, it's crazy that all\n\n3:06:41.920 --> 3:06:48.160\n these things are so connected. This is another multi computation story. Another story of where\n\n3:06:48.160 --> 3:06:54.320\n what's happening is that the economic consciousness, the economic observer is not going to deal with\n\n3:06:54.320 --> 3:06:57.680\n all of those are different microscopic transactions. They're just going to parse the\n\n3:06:57.680 --> 3:07:03.040\n whole thing by saying, there's this value, it's a number. And that's their understanding of their\n\n3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:07.680\n summary of this economic network. And there will be all kinds of things like there are all kinds of\n\n3:07:07.680 --> 3:07:13.200\n arbitrage opportunities, which are kind of like the quantum effects in this whole thing. And that's\n\n3:07:14.000 --> 3:07:21.520\n in places where there's sort of different paths that can be followed and so on. So the question\n\n3:07:21.520 --> 3:07:27.040\n is, can one make a sort of global theory of economics? And then my test case is again,\n\n3:07:27.040 --> 3:07:33.520\n what is time dilation in economics? And I know if you imagine a very agricultural economics where\n\n3:07:33.520 --> 3:07:38.000\n people are growing lettuces and fields and things like this, and you ask questions about, well,\n\n3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:43.280\n if you're transporting lettuces to different places, what is the value of the lettuces after\n\n3:07:43.280 --> 3:07:47.440\n you have to transport them versus if you're just sitting in one place and selling them,\n\n3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:51.120\n you can kind of get a little bit of an analogy there. But I think there's a better and more\n\n3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:56.080\n complete analogy. And that's the question of, is there a theory like general relativity that is a\n\n3:07:56.080 --> 3:08:00.560\n global theory of economics? And is it about something we care about? It could be that there\n\n3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:05.520\n is a global theory, but it's about a feature of economic reality that isn't important to us.\n\n3:08:05.520 --> 3:08:11.040\n Now, another part of the story is, can one use those ideas to make essentially a distributed\n\n3:08:11.040 --> 3:08:16.240\n blockchain, a distributed generalization of blockchain, kind of the quantum analog of money,\n\n3:08:16.240 --> 3:08:21.920\n so to speak, where you have, for example, you can have uncertainty relations where you're saying,\n\n3:08:21.920 --> 3:08:27.600\n you know, well, if I insist on knowing my bank account right now, there'll be some uncertainty.\n\n3:08:27.600 --> 3:08:32.960\n If I'm prepared to wait a while, then it'll be much more certain. And so there's, you know,\n\n3:08:32.960 --> 3:08:39.040\n is there a way of using and so we've made a bunch of prototypes of this, which I'm not yet happy\n\n3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.280\n with. But what I realized is, to really understand these prototypes, I actually have to have a\n\n3:08:43.280 --> 3:08:48.080\n foundational theory of economics. And so that's kind of a, you know, it may be that we could\n\n3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:52.240\n deploy one of these prototypes as a practical system. But I think it's really going to be much\n\n3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:56.160\n better if we actually have an understanding of how this plugs into kind of the economics.\n\n3:08:56.160 --> 3:08:59.760\n And that means like a fundamental theory of transactions between\n\n3:09:00.320 --> 3:09:03.760\n entities. That's what you mean by economics.\n\n3:09:03.760 --> 3:09:08.480\n Yes, I think so. But I mean, you know, how there emerge sort of laws of economics,\n\n3:09:08.480 --> 3:09:12.560\n I don't even know. And I've been asking friends of mine who are economists and things,\n\n3:09:12.560 --> 3:09:17.120\n what is economics? You know, is it an axiomatic theory? Is it a theory\n\n3:09:17.120 --> 3:09:22.480\n that is kind of a qualitative description theory? Is it, you know, what kind of a theory is it? Is\n\n3:09:22.480 --> 3:09:27.520\n it a theory, you know, what kind of thinking? It's like in biology, in evolutionary biology,\n\n3:09:27.520 --> 3:09:32.240\n for example, there's a certain pattern of thinking that goes on in evolutionary biology where\n\n3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:36.720\n if you're a, you know, a good evolutionary biologist, somebody says, that creature has a\n\n3:09:36.720 --> 3:09:41.440\n weird horn. And they'll say, well, that's because this and this and this and the selection of this\n\n3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:46.960\n kind and that kind. And that's the story. And it's not a mathematical story. It's a story of\n\n3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:52.080\n a different type of thinking about these things. By the way, evolutionary biology is yet another\n\n3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:58.080\n place where it looks like this multi computational idea can be applied. And that's where maybe\n\n3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:03.360\n speciation is related to things like event horizons. And there's a whole other kind of\n\n3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:08.560\n world of that. But it seems like this kind of model can be applicable to so many aspects,\n\n3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:15.840\n like the different levels of understanding of our reality. So it could be the biology,\n\n3:10:15.840 --> 3:10:23.360\n the chemistry, at the physics level, the economics. And you could potentially, the thing is, it's like,\n\n3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:28.800\n okay, sure, at all these levels, it might rhyme. It might make sense as a model. The question is,\n\n3:10:28.800 --> 3:10:34.080\n can you make useful predictions as one of these levels? That's right. And that's really a question\n\n3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:40.480\n of, you know, it's a weird situation because the situation where the model probably has definite\n\n3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:45.040\n consequences. The question is, are they consequences we care about? Yeah. And that's\n\n3:10:45.040 --> 3:10:55.600\n some, you know, and so in the case of, in the economic case, the, where, so, you know,\n\n3:10:55.600 --> 3:11:02.000\n one thing is this idea of using kind of physics like notions to construct a kind of distributed\n\n3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:07.120\n analog of blockchain. Okay. The much more pragmatic thing is a different direction.\n\n3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:11.120\n And it has to do with this computational language that we built to describe the world\n\n3:11:11.120 --> 3:11:15.760\n that knows about, you know, different kinds of cookies and knows about different cities and\n\n3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:21.120\n knows about how to compute all these kinds of things. One of the things that is of interest is\n\n3:11:21.120 --> 3:11:27.520\n if you want to run the world, you need, you know, with contracts and laws and rules and so on,\n\n3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:33.520\n there are rules at a human level and there are kind of things like, and so this gets one into\n\n3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:38.320\n the idea of computational contracts. You know, right now when we write a contract, it's a piece\n\n3:11:38.320 --> 3:11:43.760\n of legalese. It's, you know, it's just written in English and it's not something that's automatically\n\n3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:50.080\n analyzable, executable, whatever else. It's just English. You know, back in Gottfried Leibniz,\n\n3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:57.520\n back in, you know, 1680 or whatever was like, I'm going to, you know, figure out how to use logic\n\n3:11:57.520 --> 3:12:02.720\n to decide legal cases and so on. And he had kind of this idea of let's make a computational language\n\n3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:09.920\n for the human law. Forget about modeling nature, forgot about natural laws. What about human law?\n\n3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:14.880\n Can we make kind of a computational representation of that? Well, I think finally we're close to\n\n3:12:14.880 --> 3:12:20.000\n being able to do that. And one of the projects that I hope to get to as soon as there's a little\n\n3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.400\n bit of slowing down of some of this Cambrian explosion that's happening is a project I've\n\n3:12:24.400 --> 3:12:29.040\n been meaning to really do for a long time, which is what I'm calling a symbolic discourse language.\n\n3:12:29.040 --> 3:12:34.400\n It's just finishing the job of being able to represent everything like the conversation we're\n\n3:12:34.400 --> 3:12:40.240\n having in computational terms. And one of the use cases for that is computational contracts.\n\n3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:45.920\n Another use case is something like the constitution that says what the AIs, what we want the AIs to do.\n\n3:12:45.920 --> 3:12:50.880\n So, but this is useful. So you're saying, so these are like, you're saying computational contracts,\n\n3:12:50.880 --> 3:12:55.920\n but smart contracts. This is what's in the domain of cryptocurrency is known as smart contracts.\n\n3:12:55.920 --> 3:13:02.240\n And so the language you've developed, this symbolic or seek to further develop symbolic discourse\n\n3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:09.600\n language enables you to write a contract and write a contract that richly represents\n\n3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:16.320\n some aspect of the world. So, I mean, smart contracts tend to be right now mostly about\n\n3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:20.800\n things happening on the blockchain. And sometimes they have oracles. And in fact, our Wolfman Alpha\n\n3:13:20.800 --> 3:13:26.160\n API is the main thing people use to get information about the real world, so to speak,\n\n3:13:26.160 --> 3:13:31.360\n within smart contracts. So Wolfram Alpha, as it stands, is a really good oracle for\n\n3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:34.640\n whoever wants to use it. That's perhaps where the relationship with Cardano is.\n\n3:13:34.640 --> 3:13:37.680\n Yeah, well, that's how we started getting involved with blockchains. As we realized,\n\n3:13:37.680 --> 3:13:43.200\n people were using Wolfram Alpha as the oracle for smart contracts, so to speak. And so that\n\n3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:49.040\n got us interested in blockchains in general. And what was ended up happening is Wolfram Language\n\n3:13:49.040 --> 3:13:53.760\n is, with its symbolic representation of things, is really very good at representing things like\n\n3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:58.640\n blockchains. And so I think we now have, and we don't really know all the comparisons, but we now\n\n3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:04.320\n have a really nice environment within Wolfram Language for dealing with the sort of, for\n\n3:14:04.320 --> 3:14:08.240\n representing what happens in blockchains, for analyzing what happens in blockchains.\n\n3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:15.120\n We have a whole effort in blockchain analytics. And we've sort of published some samples of how\n\n3:14:15.120 --> 3:14:20.400\n that works. But it's because our technology stack, Wolfram Language and Mathematica,\n\n3:14:20.400 --> 3:14:29.200\n are very widely used in the quant finance world. There's a sort of immediate coevolution there of\n\n3:14:29.200 --> 3:14:35.200\n the quant finance kind of thing and blockchain analytics. So it's kind of the representation\n\n3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:40.240\n of blockchain in computational language. Then ultimately, it's kind of like, how do you run\n\n3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:45.040\n the world with code? That is, how do you write sort of all these things which are right now,\n\n3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:50.720\n regulations and laws and contracts and things in computational language? And kind of the ultimate\n\n3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:55.680\n vision is that sort of something happens in the world, and then there's this giant domino effect\n\n3:14:55.680 --> 3:15:00.400\n of all these computational contracts that trigger based on the thing that happened. And there's a\n\n3:15:00.400 --> 3:15:06.480\n whole story to that. And of course, I like to always pay attention to the latest things that\n\n3:15:06.480 --> 3:15:11.680\n are going on. And I really, I kind of like blockchain because it's another rethinking\n\n3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:16.240\n of kind of computation. It's kind of like cloud computing was a little bit of that, of sort of\n\n3:15:16.240 --> 3:15:23.600\n persistent kind of computational resources and so on. And this multi computation is a big\n\n3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:28.400\n rethinking of kind of what it means to compute. Blockchain is another bit of rethinking of what\n\n3:15:28.400 --> 3:15:33.520\n it means to compute. The idea that you lodge kind of these autonomous lumps of computation\n\n3:15:33.520 --> 3:15:39.200\n out there in the blockchain world. And one of the things that just sort of for fun,\n\n3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:44.080\n so to speak, is we've been doing a bit of stuff with NFTs, and we just did some NFTs on Cardano,\n\n3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:48.880\n and we'll be doing some more. And we did some cellular automaton NFTs on Cardano,\n\n3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:55.120\n which people seem to like quite a bit. And one of the things I've realized about NFTs\n\n3:15:55.120 --> 3:16:01.520\n is that there's kind of this notion, and we're really working on this, I like recording stuff.\n\n3:16:01.520 --> 3:16:06.640\n You know, one of the things that's come out of kind of my science, I suppose, is this history\n\n3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:11.840\n matters type story of, you know, it's not just the current state, it's the history that matters.\n\n3:16:11.840 --> 3:16:17.120\n And I've kind of, I don't think this is actually realizing, maybe it's not coincidental that I'm\n\n3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:20.960\n sort of the human who's recorded more about themselves than anybody else. And then I end up\n\n3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:26.160\n with these science results that say history matters, which was not those things. I didn't\n\n3:16:26.160 --> 3:16:30.880\n think those were connected, but they're at least correlated, yes. Yeah, right. So, you know,\n\n3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:36.000\n this question about sort of recording what has happened and having sort of a permanent record\n\n3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:39.840\n of things, one of the things that's kind of interesting there is, you know, you put up a\n\n3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:43.360\n website and it's got a bunch of stuff on it, but you know, you have to keep paying the hosting\n\n3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:48.160\n fees or the thing's going to go away. But one of the things about blockchain is quite interesting\n\n3:16:48.160 --> 3:16:53.120\n is if you put something on a blockchain and you pay, you know, your commission to get that thing,\n\n3:16:53.120 --> 3:16:59.120\n you know, put on, you know, mine, put on the blockchain, then in a sense, everybody who comes\n\n3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:04.480\n after you is, you know, they are motivated to keep your thing alive because that's what keeps\n\n3:17:04.480 --> 3:17:09.200\n the consistency of the blockchain. So in a sense with sort of the NFT world, it's kind of like if\n\n3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:14.400\n you want to have something permanent, well, at least for the life of the blockchain, but even if\n\n3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:18.800\n the blockchain goes out of circulation, so to speak, there's going to be enough value in that\n\n3:17:18.800 --> 3:17:23.200\n whole collection of transactions that people are going to archive the thing. But that means that,\n\n3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:28.400\n you know, pay once and you're kind of, you're lodged in the blockchain forever. And so we've\n\n3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:35.280\n been kind of playing around with sort of a hobby thing of mine of thinking about sort of the NFTs\n\n3:17:35.280 --> 3:17:41.760\n and how you and sort of the consumer idea of kind of the it's the it's the anti, you know,\n\n3:17:41.760 --> 3:17:46.720\n it's the opposite of the Snapchat view of the world. There's a permanence to it that's heavily\n\n3:17:46.720 --> 3:17:54.640\n incentivized and thereby you can have a permanence of history. Right. And that's that's that's kind of\n\n3:17:54.640 --> 3:17:59.040\n the now, you know, so that's so that's one of the things we've been doing with Cardano. And it's\n\n3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:03.360\n kind of fun. I think that I mean, this whole question about, you know, you mentioned automated\n\n3:18:03.360 --> 3:18:08.320\n theorem proving and blockchains and so on. And as I've thought about this kind of physics inspired\n\n3:18:08.320 --> 3:18:14.560\n distributed blockchain, obviously, there, the sort of the proof that it works, that there are no\n\n3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:20.400\n double spends, there's no whatever else, that proof becomes a very formal kind of almost a\n\n3:18:20.400 --> 3:18:25.440\n matter of physics, so to speak. And, you know, it's been it's been an interesting thing for the\n\n3:18:25.440 --> 3:18:30.400\n for the practical blockchains to do kind of actual automated theorem proving. And I don't think\n\n3:18:30.400 --> 3:18:34.880\n anybody's really managed it in an interesting case yet. It's a thing that people, you know,\n\n3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:39.600\n aspire to. But I think it's a challenging thing because basically, the point is one of the one\n\n3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:44.080\n of the things about proving correctness of something as well. You know, people say I've\n\n3:18:44.080 --> 3:18:47.840\n got this program and I'm going to prove it's correct. It's like, what does that mean? You\n\n3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:51.760\n have to say what correct means. I mean, it's it's kind of like then you have to have another\n\n3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:56.240\n language. And people are very confused back in past decades of, you know, oh, we're going to\n\n3:18:56.240 --> 3:19:00.960\n prove the correctness by representing the program in another language, which we also don't know\n\n3:19:00.960 --> 3:19:06.240\n whether it's correct. And, you know, often by correctness, we just mean it can't crash or it\n\n3:19:06.240 --> 3:19:10.640\n can't scribble on memory. But but the thing is that there's this complicated trade off,\n\n3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:15.200\n because as soon as there's as soon as you're really using computation, you have computational\n\n3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:20.480\n irreducibility, you have undecidability. If you want to use computation seriously,\n\n3:19:20.480 --> 3:19:26.160\n you have to kind of let go of the idea that you're going to be able to box it in and say,\n\n3:19:26.160 --> 3:19:30.240\n we're going to have just this happen and not anything else. I mean, this is a this is an old\n\n3:19:30.240 --> 3:19:35.680\n fact. I mean, G\u00f6del's theorem tries to say, you know, piano arithmetic, the axioms of arithmetic,\n\n3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:40.400\n can you box in the integers and say these axioms give just the integers and nothing about the\n\n3:19:40.400 --> 3:19:46.160\n integers. G\u00f6del's theorem showed that wasn't the case. You can have all these wild, weird things\n\n3:19:46.160 --> 3:19:50.480\n that are obey the piano axioms, but aren't integers. And there's this kind of infinite\n\n3:19:50.480 --> 3:19:55.280\n hierarchy of additional axioms you would have to add. And it's kind of the same thing. You don't\n\n3:19:55.280 --> 3:20:00.400\n get to, you know, if you want to say, I want to know what happens, you're boxing yourself in and\n\n3:20:00.400 --> 3:20:05.360\n there's a limit to what can happen, so to speak. So it's a complicated trade off. And it's a big\n\n3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:09.920\n trade off for AI, so to speak. It's kind of like, do you want to let computation actually do what\n\n3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:14.960\n it can do? Or do you want to say, no, it's very, very boxed in to the point where we can understand\n\n3:20:14.960 --> 3:20:21.680\n every step. And that's kind of a thing that becomes difficult to do. But that's, I mean,\n\n3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:28.000\n in general, I would say one of the things that's kind of complicated in my sort of life and the\n\n3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:32.960\n whole sort of story of computational language and all this technology and science and so on.\n\n3:20:32.960 --> 3:20:38.480\n I mean, I kind of in the flow of one's life, it's sort of interesting to see how these things play\n\n3:20:38.480 --> 3:20:43.920\n out because I've kind of concluded that I'm in the business of making kind of artifacts from the\n\n3:20:43.920 --> 3:20:48.960\n future, which means, you know, there are things that I've done, I don't know, this physics project,\n\n3:20:48.960 --> 3:20:52.960\n I don't know whether anybody would have gotten to it for 50 years. You know, the fact that\n\n3:20:52.960 --> 3:20:58.160\n Mathematica is a third of a century old, and I know that a bunch of the core ideas are not\n\n3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:02.960\n well absorbed. I mean, that is people finally got this idea that I thought was a triviality\n\n3:21:02.960 --> 3:21:08.800\n of notebooks, that was 25 years. And, you know, some of these core ideas about symbolic computation\n\n3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:15.680\n and so on are not absorbed. I mean, people use them every day in Wolfram language and, you know,\n\n3:21:15.680 --> 3:21:19.920\n do all kinds of cool things with them. But if you say, what is the fundamental intellectual point\n\n3:21:19.920 --> 3:21:25.440\n here? It's not well absorbed. And it's something where you kind of realize that you're sort of\n\n3:21:25.440 --> 3:21:30.160\n building things. And I kind of made this thing about, you know, we're building artifacts from\n\n3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:35.600\n the future, so to speak. And I mentioned that we have a conference coming up actually in a couple\n\n3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:40.640\n of weeks, our annual technology conference, where we talk about all the things we're doing.\n\n3:21:41.520 --> 3:21:46.080\n And, you know, so I was talking about it last year, about, you know, we're making artifacts\n\n3:21:46.080 --> 3:21:50.800\n from the future. And I was kind of like, I had some version of that, that was kind of a dark\n\n3:21:50.800 --> 3:21:54.560\n and frustrated thing of like, you know, I'm building things which nobody's going to care\n\n3:21:54.560 --> 3:22:01.360\n about until long after I'm dead, so to speak. But then I realized, you know, people were sort of\n\n3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:06.320\n telling me afterwards, you know, that's exactly how, you know, we're using Wolfram language in\n\n3:22:06.320 --> 3:22:10.560\n some particular setting and, you know, some computational X field or some organization or\n\n3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:15.440\n whatever. And it's like, people are saying, oh, you know, what did you manage to do? You know,\n\n3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:18.480\n well, we know that in principle, it will be possible to do that. But we didn't know that\n\n3:22:18.480 --> 3:22:23.280\n was possible now. And it's kind of like, that's sort of the business we're in. And in a sense,\n\n3:22:23.280 --> 3:22:27.760\n with some of these ideas in science, you know, I feel a little bit the same way that there are\n\n3:22:27.760 --> 3:22:35.040\n some of these things where, you know, some things like, for example, this whole idea, well, so to\n\n3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:39.440\n relate to another sort of piece of history and the future, one of, you know, I mentioned at the\n\n3:22:39.440 --> 3:22:44.560\n beginning kind of complexity as this thing that I was interested in back 40 years ago and so on.\n\n3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:50.080\n Where does complexity come from? Well, I think we kind of nailed that. The answer is in the\n\n3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:54.880\n computational universe, even simple programs make it. And that's kind of the secret that nature has\n\n3:22:54.880 --> 3:23:02.160\n that allows you to make it. So that's that part. But the bigger picture there was this idea of\n\n3:23:02.160 --> 3:23:06.640\n this kind of computational paradigm, the idea that you could go beyond mathematical equations,\n\n3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:13.040\n which have been sort of the primary modeling medium for 300 years. And so it was like, look,\n\n3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:18.160\n it is inexorably the case that people will use programs rather than just equations. And, you\n\n3:23:18.160 --> 3:23:22.720\n know, I was saying that in the 1980s and people were, you know, I published my big book, New Kind\n\n3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:28.880\n of Science, that'll be 20 years ago next year. So in 2002, and people were saying, oh, no,\n\n3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:32.960\n this can't possibly be true. You know, we know for 300 years we've been doing all this stuff.\n\n3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:38.480\n Right. To be fair, I now realize I'm a little bit more analysis of what people actually\n\n3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:44.000\n said in pretty much every field other than physics. People said, oh, these are new models.\n\n3:23:44.000 --> 3:23:48.640\n That's pretty interesting. In physics, people were like, we've got our physics models. We're\n\n3:23:48.640 --> 3:23:53.040\n very happy with them. Yeah, in physics, there's more resistance because of the attachment and\n\n3:23:53.040 --> 3:23:58.000\n the power of the equations. The idea that programs might be the right way to approach\n\n3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:05.120\n this field. Was there some resistance? And like you're saying, it takes time. For somebody who\n\n3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:09.520\n likes the idea of time dilation and all these applications, I thought you would understand this.\n\n3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:14.480\n Yeah, right. But, you know, and computational irreducibility. Yes, exactly. But I mean,\n\n3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:20.160\n it is really interesting that just 20 years, a span of 20 years, it's gone from, you know,\n\n3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:28.240\n pitchforks and horror to, yeah, we get it. And, you know, it's helped that we've, you know, in our\n\n3:24:28.240 --> 3:24:32.560\n current effort in fundamental physics, we've gotten a lot further and we've managed to\n\n3:24:33.200 --> 3:24:37.680\n put a lot of puzzle pieces together that make sense. But the thing that I've been thinking\n\n3:24:37.680 --> 3:24:43.600\n about recently is this field of complexity. So I've kind of was a sort of a field builder.\n\n3:24:43.600 --> 3:24:50.320\n Back in the 1980s, I was kind of like, okay, you know, can we, you know, I'd understood this point\n\n3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.320\n that there was this sort of fundamental phenomenon of complexity that showed up in lots of places.\n\n3:24:54.320 --> 3:25:01.360\n And I was like, this is an interesting sort of field of science. And I was recently was reminded,\n\n3:25:01.360 --> 3:25:07.360\n I was at this, the very first sort of get together of what became the Santa Fe Institute. And I was\n\n3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:11.440\n like, in fact, there's even an audio recording of me sort of saying, people have been talking about,\n\n3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:16.000\n oh, what should this, you know, outfit do? And I was saying, well, there is this thing that I've\n\n3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:21.520\n been thinking about. It's this kind of idea of complexity. And it's kind of like, and that's\n\n3:25:21.520 --> 3:25:25.520\n what that ended up. And you planted the seed of complexity at Santa Fe. That's beautiful.\n\n3:25:25.520 --> 3:25:31.120\n It's a beautiful vision. But I mean, so that, but what's happened then is this idea of complexity\n\n3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:35.920\n and, you know, and I started the first research center at University of Illinois for doing that\n\n3:25:35.920 --> 3:25:42.640\n in the first journal, complex systems and so on. And it's kind of an interesting thing in my life,\n\n3:25:42.640 --> 3:25:47.680\n at least that it's kind of like you plant the seed, you have this idea. It's a kind of a science\n\n3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:52.960\n idea. You have this idea of sort of focusing on the phenomenon of complexity. The deeper idea was\n\n3:25:52.960 --> 3:25:58.480\n this computational paradigm. But the nominal idea is this kind of idea of complexity. Okay. Then you\n\n3:25:58.480 --> 3:26:05.520\n roll time forward 30 years or whatever, 35 years, whatever it is. And you say, what happened? Okay.\n\n3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:10.080\n Well now there are a thousand complexity institutes around the world. I think more or less,\n\n3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:15.120\n we've been trying to count them. And, you know, there are 40 complexity journals, I think.\n\n3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:22.160\n And so it's kind of like what actually happened in this field, right? And I look at a lot of what\n\n3:26:22.160 --> 3:26:28.160\n happened and I'm like, you know, I have to admit to some eye rolling, so to speak, because it's\n\n3:26:28.160 --> 3:26:33.360\n kind of like, like, what is, what's actually going on? Well, what people definitely got\n\n3:26:33.360 --> 3:26:38.240\n was this idea of computational models. And then they got, but they thought one of the,\n\n3:26:38.240 --> 3:26:42.720\n one of the kind of cognitive mistakes, I think is they say, we've got a computational model\n\n3:26:43.200 --> 3:26:49.600\n and it, and we're looking at a system that's complex and our computational model gives\n\n3:26:49.600 --> 3:26:55.920\n complexity. By golly, that must mean it's right. And unfortunately, because complexity is a generic\n\n3:26:55.920 --> 3:27:01.120\n phenomenon and computational irreducibility is a generic phenomenon that actually tells you nothing.\n\n3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:06.240\n And so then the question is, well, what can you do? You know, there's a lot of things that have\n\n3:27:06.240 --> 3:27:10.560\n been sort of done under this banner of complexity. And I think it's been very successful in providing\n\n3:27:10.560 --> 3:27:15.200\n sort of an interdisciplinary way of connecting different fields together. Which is powerful\n\n3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:19.440\n in itself. Right. I mean, that's a very useful. Biology and economics and physics. Right. It's a\n\n3:27:19.440 --> 3:27:23.760\n good organizing principle, but in the end, a lot of that is around this sort of computational\n\n3:27:23.760 --> 3:27:28.960\n paradigm, computational modeling. That's the raw material that powers that kind of, that kind of\n\n3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:33.360\n correspondence, I think. But the question is sort of, what is the, you know, I was just thinking\n\n3:27:33.360 --> 3:27:38.960\n recently, you know, we've been, I mean, the other we've been, we've been for years, people have\n\n3:27:38.960 --> 3:27:43.440\n told me you should start some Wolfram Institute that does basic science. You know, all I have\n\n3:27:43.440 --> 3:27:47.920\n is a company that, that builds software and we, you know, we have a little piece that does basic\n\n3:27:47.920 --> 3:27:52.480\n science as kind of a hobby. People are saying you should start this Wolfram Institute thing.\n\n3:27:52.480 --> 3:27:56.000\n And I've been, you know, cause I've known about lots of institutes and I've seen kind of their\n\n3:27:56.000 --> 3:28:00.240\n flow of money and, and kind of, you know, what happens in different situations and so on. So I've\n\n3:28:00.240 --> 3:28:05.120\n been kind of reluctant, but, but I've, I've, I have realized that, you know, what we've done with\n\n3:28:05.120 --> 3:28:10.720\n our company over the last 35 years, you know, we built a very good machine for doing R and D and,\n\n3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:16.000\n you know, innovating and creating things. And I just applied that machine to the physics project.\n\n3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:20.080\n That's how we did the physics project in a fairly short amount of time with a, you know,\n\n3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:25.840\n a efficient machine with, you know, various people involved and so on. And so, you know,\n\n3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:31.040\n it, it works for basic science and it's like, we can do more of this. And so now.\n\n3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:34.480\n In biology and chemistry, so it's, it's become an institute.\n\n3:28:34.480 --> 3:28:36.160\n Yes. Well, it needs to become an institute.\n\n3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:37.280\n An official institute.\n\n3:28:37.280 --> 3:28:41.600\n Right. Right. But the, the thing that, so I was thinking about, okay, so what do we do with\n\n3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:46.240\n complexity? You know, what, what, there are all these people who've, you know, what, what should\n\n3:28:46.240 --> 3:28:50.800\n happen to that field? And what I realized is there's kind of this area of foundations of\n\n3:28:50.800 --> 3:28:56.160\n complexity. That's about these questions about simple programs, what they do that's far away\n\n3:28:56.160 --> 3:29:00.000\n from a bunch of the detailed applications that people, it's not far away. It's, it's the,\n\n3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:05.040\n it's the under, you know, the, the bedrock underneath those applications. And so I realized\n\n3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:12.160\n recently, this is my recent kind of little innovation of a sort, a post that I'll do very\n\n3:29:12.160 --> 3:29:20.400\n soon about kind of, you know, the foundations of complexity. What really are they? I think\n\n3:29:20.400 --> 3:29:26.480\n there are really two ideas, two conceptual ideas that I hadn't really enunciated, I think before.\n\n3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:31.440\n One is what I call meta modeling. The other is ruleology. So what is meta modeling? So\n\n3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:36.000\n meta modeling is you've got this complicated model and it's a model of, you know, hedgehogs\n\n3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:40.720\n interacting with this, interacting with that. And the question is what's really underneath that?\n\n3:29:40.720 --> 3:29:45.600\n What is it? You know, is it a Turing machine? Is it a cellular automaton? You know,\n\n3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:51.120\n what is the underlying stuff underneath that model? And so there's this kind of meta science\n\n3:29:51.120 --> 3:29:56.560\n question of given these models, what is the core model? And I realized, I mean, to me,\n\n3:29:56.560 --> 3:30:00.880\n that's sort of an obvious question, but then I realized I've been doing language design for 40\n\n3:30:00.880 --> 3:30:05.120\n years and language design is exactly that question. You know, underneath all of this\n\n3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:10.080\n detailed stuff people do, what are the underlying primitives? And that's a question people haven't\n\n3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:13.920\n tended to ask about models. They say, well, we've got this nice model for this and that and the\n\n3:30:13.920 --> 3:30:18.640\n other, what's really underneath it? And what, you know, because once you have the thing that's\n\n3:30:18.640 --> 3:30:24.000\n underneath it, well, for example, this multi computation idea is an ultimate meta modeling\n\n3:30:24.000 --> 3:30:29.680\n idea because it's saying underneath all these fields is one kind of paradigmatic structure.\n\n3:30:29.680 --> 3:30:36.240\n And, you know, you can imagine the same kind of thing in much more sort of much sort of shallower\n\n3:30:36.240 --> 3:30:41.760\n levels in different kinds of modeling. So the first activity is this kind of meta modeling,\n\n3:30:41.760 --> 3:30:47.920\n the kind of the models about models, so to speak. You know, what is the, what's, you know,\n\n3:30:47.920 --> 3:30:53.200\n drilling down into models? That's one thing. The other thing is this thing that I think we're\n\n3:30:53.200 --> 3:30:57.840\n going to call ruleology, which is kind of the, okay, you've got these simple rules. You've got\n\n3:30:57.840 --> 3:31:01.600\n cellular automata, you've got turing machines, you've got substitution systems, you've got\n\n3:31:01.600 --> 3:31:06.160\n register machines, you've got all these different things. What do they actually do in the wild? And\n\n3:31:06.160 --> 3:31:10.880\n this is an area that I've spent a lot of time, you know, working on. It's a lot of stuff in my new\n\n3:31:10.880 --> 3:31:16.160\n kind of science book is about this. You know, this new book I wrote about combinators is full of\n\n3:31:16.160 --> 3:31:21.840\n stuff like this. And this journal Complex Systems has lots of papers about these kinds of things.\n\n3:31:21.840 --> 3:31:26.240\n But there isn't really a home for people who do ruleology or what I'm now...\n\n3:31:26.240 --> 3:31:29.520\n As you call the basic science of rules.\n\n3:31:29.520 --> 3:31:35.120\n Yes. Yes. Right. So it's like, you've got some, what is it? Is it mathematics? No,\n\n3:31:35.120 --> 3:31:38.960\n it isn't really like mathematics. In fact, from my now understanding of metamathematics,\n\n3:31:38.960 --> 3:31:43.760\n I understand that it's the molecular dynamics level. It's not the level that mathematicians\n\n3:31:43.760 --> 3:31:48.400\n have traditionally cared about. It's not computer science because computer science is about writing\n\n3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:53.760\n programs that do things, you know, that were for a purpose, not programs in the wild, so to speak.\n\n3:31:53.760 --> 3:31:57.600\n It's not physics. It doesn't have anything to do with, you know, maybe underneath some physics,\n\n3:31:57.600 --> 3:32:02.720\n but it's not physics as such. So it just hasn't had a home. And if you look at, you know,\n\n3:32:02.720 --> 3:32:08.480\n but what's great about it is it's a surviving field, so to speak. It's something where,\n\n3:32:08.480 --> 3:32:13.360\n you know, one of the things I find sort of inspiring about mathematics, for example,\n\n3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:18.240\n is you look at mathematics that was done, you know, in ancient Greece, ancient, you know, Babylon,\n\n3:32:18.240 --> 3:32:23.360\n Egypt, and so on. It's still here today. You know, you find an icosahedron that somebody made\n\n3:32:23.360 --> 3:32:28.640\n in ancient Egypt. You look at it. Oh, that's a very modern thing. It's an icosahedron. You know,\n\n3:32:28.640 --> 3:32:34.560\n it's a timeless kind of activity. And this idea of studying simple rules and what they do,\n\n3:32:34.560 --> 3:32:39.920\n it's a timeless activity. And I can see that over the last 40 years or so as, you know,\n\n3:32:39.920 --> 3:32:44.800\n even with cellular automata, it's kind of like, you know, you can sort of catalog what are the\n\n3:32:44.800 --> 3:32:50.400\n different cellular automata used for and, you know, like the simplest rules like one, you might\n\n3:32:50.400 --> 3:32:56.640\n even know this one, Rule 184. Rule 184 is a minimal model for road traffic flow. And, you know, it's\n\n3:32:56.640 --> 3:33:01.120\n also a minimal model for various other things. But it's kind of fun that you can literally say,\n\n3:33:01.120 --> 3:33:07.600\n you know, Rule 90 is a minimal model for this and this and this. Rule 4 is a minimal model for this.\n\n3:33:07.600 --> 3:33:13.200\n And it's kind of remarkable that you can just by in this raw level of this kind of study of rules,\n\n3:33:13.200 --> 3:33:17.840\n they then branch, they're the raw material that you can use to make models of different things.\n\n3:33:17.840 --> 3:33:23.200\n So it's a very pure basic science, but it's one that, you know, people have explored it,\n\n3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:27.040\n but they've been kind of a little bit in the wilderness. And I think, you know, one of the\n\n3:33:27.040 --> 3:33:32.720\n things that I would like to do finally is, you know, I always thought that sort of this notion\n\n3:33:32.720 --> 3:33:40.800\n of pure NKS, pure NKS being the acronym for my book, New Kind of Science, was something that\n\n3:33:40.800 --> 3:33:44.640\n people should be doing. And, you know, we tried to figure out what's the right institutional\n\n3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:48.720\n structure to do this stuff. You know, we dealt with a bunch of universities. Oh, you know,\n\n3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:53.040\n can we do this here? Well, what department would be in it? Well, it isn't in a department. It's\n\n3:33:53.040 --> 3:33:57.440\n its own new kind of thing. That's why the book was called The New Kind of Science.\n\n3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:03.040\n It's kind of the, because that's an increasingly good description of what it is, so to speak.\n\n3:34:03.040 --> 3:34:08.480\n We're actually, we were thinking about kind of the ruleological society because we're realizing\n\n3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:14.080\n that it's kind of, it's, you know, it's very interesting. I mean, I've never really done\n\n3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:18.080\n something like this before because there's this whole group of researchers who are,\n\n3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:24.080\n who've been doing things that are really, in some cases, very elegant, very surviving, very solid,\n\n3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:28.640\n you know, here's this thing that happens in this very abstract system. But it's like,\n\n3:34:29.280 --> 3:34:34.880\n it's like, what is that part of, you know, it doesn't have a home. And I think that's something\n\n3:34:34.880 --> 3:34:38.800\n I, you know, I kind of fault myself for not having been more, you know, when complexity\n\n3:34:38.800 --> 3:34:46.400\n was developing in the 80s, I didn't understand the danger of applications. That is, it's really\n\n3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:50.480\n cool that you can apply this to economics and you can apply it to evolutionary biology and this and\n\n3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:54.560\n that and the other. But what happens with applications is everything gets sucked into\n\n3:34:54.560 --> 3:34:59.520\n the applications. And the pure stuff, it's like the pure mathematics, there isn't any pure\n\n3:34:59.520 --> 3:35:05.600\n mathematics, so to speak. It's all just applications of mathematics. And I failed to kind of make sure\n\n3:35:05.600 --> 3:35:12.880\n that this kind of pure area was kind of maintained and developed. And I think now, you know, one of\n\n3:35:12.880 --> 3:35:17.280\n the things I want to try to do and, you know, it's a funny thing because I'm used to, look,\n\n3:35:17.280 --> 3:35:22.960\n I've been a tech CEO for more than half my life now. So, you know, this is what I know how to do.\n\n3:35:22.960 --> 3:35:28.400\n And, you know, I can make stuff happen and get projects to happen, even as it turns out,\n\n3:35:28.400 --> 3:35:34.880\n basic science projects in that kind of setting and how that translates into kind of, you know,\n\n3:35:34.880 --> 3:35:38.160\n there are a lot of people working on, for example, our physics project sort of distributed through\n\n3:35:38.160 --> 3:35:42.800\n the academic world and that's working just great. But the question is, you know, can we have a sort\n\n3:35:42.800 --> 3:35:49.200\n of accelerator mechanism that makes use of kind of what we've learned in sort of R&D innovation?\n\n3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:54.080\n And, you know, but on the other hand, it's a funny thing because, you know, in a company,\n\n3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:58.480\n in the end, the thing is, you know, it's a company, it makes products, it sells things,\n\n3:35:58.480 --> 3:36:03.360\n sells things to people. And, you know, when you're doing basic research, one of the challenges is\n\n3:36:03.360 --> 3:36:09.840\n there isn't that same kind of sort of mechanism. And so it's, you know, how do you drive the thing\n\n3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.000\n in a kind of, in a led kind of way so that it really can make forward progress rather than,\n\n3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:20.000\n you know, what can often happen in, you know, in academic settings where it's like,\n\n3:36:20.000 --> 3:36:24.160\n well, there are all these flowers blooming, but it's not clear that, you know, that it's...\n\n3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:29.520\n You have to have a central mission and a drive, just like you do with a company that's delivering\n\n3:36:29.520 --> 3:36:34.320\n a big overarching product. And that's... But the challenge is, you know, when you have\n\n3:36:35.600 --> 3:36:40.320\n the economics of the world are such that, you know, when you're delivering a product and people\n\n3:36:40.320 --> 3:36:44.880\n say, wow, that's useful, we'll buy it. And then that kind of feeds back and, okay, then you can\n\n3:36:45.680 --> 3:36:51.600\n pay the people who build it to eat, you know, so they can eat and so on. And with basic science,\n\n3:36:52.400 --> 3:36:57.440\n the payoff is very much less visible. And, you know, with this physics project, as I say,\n\n3:36:57.440 --> 3:37:02.320\n the big surprise has been that, I mean, you know, for example, well, the big surprise with\n\n3:37:02.320 --> 3:37:07.920\n the physics project is that it looks like it has near term applications. And I was like,\n\n3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:13.840\n I'm guessing this is 200 years away. I was kind of using the analogy of, you know, Newton\n\n3:37:14.720 --> 3:37:18.400\n starting a satellite launch company, which would have been kind of wrong time.\n\n3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:24.880\n And, you know, but it turns out that's not the case, but we can't guarantee that. And if you say\n\n3:37:24.880 --> 3:37:31.600\n we're signing up to do basic research, basic rheology, let's say, and, you know, and we can't,\n\n3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:36.000\n we don't know the horizon, you know, it's an unknown horizon. It's kind of like an undecidable\n\n3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:40.160\n kind of proposition of when is this proof going to end, so to speak? When is it going to be\n\n3:37:40.160 --> 3:37:48.720\n something that gets applied? Well, I hope this becomes a vibrant new field of rheology. I love\n\n3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:55.120\n it. Like I told you many, many times, it's one of the most amazing ideas that has been brought to\n\n3:37:55.120 --> 3:38:03.040\n this world. So I hope you get a bunch of people to explore this world. Thank you once again for\n\n3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:09.440\n spending your really valuable time with me today. Fun stuff. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this\n\n3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:14.080\n conversation with Stephen Wolfram. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the\n\n3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:21.280\n description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Richard Feynman. Nature uses only the\n\n3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:28.400\n longest threads to weave her patterns, so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization\n\n3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:45.360\n of the entire tapestry. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
