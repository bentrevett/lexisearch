--> 00:07.980\n a popular YouTube channel\n\n00:07.980 --> 00:11.020\n that uses programmatically animated visualizations\n\n00:11.020 --> 00:14.260\n to explain concepts in linear algebra, calculus,\n\n00:14.260 --> 00:16.980\n and other fields of mathematics.\n\n00:16.980 --> 00:19.820\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n00:19.820 --> 00:22.100\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:22.100 --> 00:23.960\n give us five stars on Apple Podcast,\n\n00:23.960 --> 00:26.340\n follow on Spotify, support on Patreon,\n\n00:26.340 --> 00:28.340\n or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n00:28.340 --> 00:32.180\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n00:32.180 --> 00:34.020\n I recently started doing ads\n\n00:34.020 --> 00:35.700\n at the end of the introduction.\n\n00:35.700 --> 00:38.500\n I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode\n\n00:38.500 --> 00:40.020\n and never any ads in the middle\n\n00:40.020 --> 00:42.160\n that can break the flow of the conversation.\n\n00:42.160 --> 00:43.580\n I hope that works for you\n\n00:43.580 --> 00:46.240\n and doesn't hurt the listening experience.\n\n00:47.300 --> 00:49.660\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n00:49.660 --> 00:52.020\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n00:52.020 --> 00:54.820\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n00:54.820 --> 00:56.520\n but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n00:56.520 --> 00:58.940\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n00:58.940 --> 01:01.500\n Cash App also has an investing feature.\n\n01:01.500 --> 01:04.540\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,\n\n01:04.540 --> 01:06.780\n no matter what the stock price is.\n\n01:06.780 --> 01:09.580\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n01:09.580 --> 01:13.460\n a subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.\n\n01:13.460 --> 01:15.460\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n01:15.460 --> 01:18.580\n to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,\n\n01:18.580 --> 01:22.020\n best known for their FIRST Robotics and LEGO competitions.\n\n01:22.020 --> 01:25.340\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n01:25.340 --> 01:27.060\n in over 110 countries\n\n01:27.060 --> 01:29.680\n and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n01:29.680 --> 01:31.660\n which means the donated money is used\n\n01:31.660 --> 01:34.020\n to maximum effectiveness.\n\n01:34.020 --> 01:36.900\n When you get Cash App from the App Store at Google Play\n\n01:36.900 --> 01:40.140\n and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,\n\n01:40.140 --> 01:42.820\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n01:42.820 --> 01:44.920\n which again is an organization\n\n01:44.920 --> 01:47.640\n that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys\n\n01:47.640 --> 01:51.400\n to dream of engineering a better world.\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:56.220\n And now, here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson.\n\n01:56.220 --> 01:59.100\n If there's intelligent life out there in the universe,\n\n01:59.100 --> 02:02.300\n do you think their mathematics is different than ours?\n\n02:03.260 --> 02:04.300\n Jumping right in.\n\n02:04.300 --> 02:08.340\n I think it's probably very different.\n\n02:08.340 --> 02:11.220\n There's an obvious sense the notation is different, right?\n\n02:11.220 --> 02:14.500\n I think notation can guide what the math itself is.\n\n02:14.500 --> 02:17.020\n I think it has everything to do with the form\n\n02:17.020 --> 02:19.180\n of their existence, right?\n\n02:19.180 --> 02:20.760\n Do you think they have basic arithmetic?\n\n02:20.760 --> 02:21.600\n Sorry, I interrupted.\n\n02:21.600 --> 02:23.220\n Yeah, so I think they count, right?\n\n02:23.220 --> 02:24.580\n I think notions like one, two, three,\n\n02:24.580 --> 02:27.200\n the natural numbers, that's extremely, well, natural.\n\n02:27.200 --> 02:30.460\n That's almost why we put that name to it.\n\n02:30.460 --> 02:31.760\n As soon as you can count,\n\n02:31.760 --> 02:34.020\n you have a notion of repetition, right?\n\n02:34.020 --> 02:37.340\n Because you can count by two, two times or three times.\n\n02:37.340 --> 02:39.800\n And so you have this notion of repeating\n\n02:39.800 --> 02:42.180\n the idea of counting, which brings you addition\n\n02:42.180 --> 02:43.780\n and multiplication.\n\n02:43.780 --> 02:47.540\n I think the way that we extend it to the real numbers,\n\n02:47.540 --> 02:49.280\n there's a little bit of choice in that.\n\n02:49.280 --> 02:50.820\n So there's this funny number system\n\n02:50.820 --> 02:52.220\n called the servial numbers\n\n02:52.220 --> 02:55.660\n that it captures the idea of continuity.\n\n02:55.660 --> 02:57.580\n It's a distinct mathematical object.\n\n02:57.580 --> 03:00.420\n You could very well model the universe\n\n03:00.420 --> 03:02.020\n and motion of planets with that\n\n03:02.020 --> 03:04.820\n as the back end of your math, right?\n\n03:04.820 --> 03:06.500\n And you still have kind of the same interface\n\n03:06.500 --> 03:10.620\n with the front end of what physical laws you're trying to,\n\n03:10.620 --> 03:12.420\n or what physical phenomena you're trying\n\n03:12.420 --> 03:13.780\n to describe with math.\n\n03:13.780 --> 03:15.900\n And I wonder if the little glimpses that we have\n\n03:15.900 --> 03:17.700\n of what choices you can make along the way\n\n03:17.700 --> 03:19.320\n based on what different mathematicians\n\n03:19.320 --> 03:20.440\n I've brought to the table\n\n03:20.440 --> 03:22.300\n is just scratching the surface\n\n03:22.300 --> 03:24.540\n of what the different possibilities are\n\n03:24.540 --> 03:27.540\n if you have a completely different mode of thought, right?\n\n03:27.540 --> 03:29.700\n Or a mode of interacting with the universe.\n\n03:29.700 --> 03:32.540\n And you think notation is a key part of the journey\n\n03:32.540 --> 03:33.860\n that we've taken through math.\n\n03:33.860 --> 03:35.140\n I think that's the most salient part\n\n03:35.140 --> 03:36.420\n that you'd notice at first.\n\n03:36.420 --> 03:38.880\n I think the mode of thought is gonna influence things\n\n03:38.880 --> 03:40.400\n more than like the notation itself.\n\n03:40.400 --> 03:42.700\n But notation actually carries a lot of weight\n\n03:42.700 --> 03:44.620\n when it comes to how we think about things,\n\n03:44.620 --> 03:47.100\n more so than we usually give it credit for.\n\n03:47.100 --> 03:48.900\n I would be comfortable saying.\n\n03:48.900 --> 03:52.020\n Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece of notation\n\n03:52.020 --> 03:53.260\n in terms of its effectiveness?\n\n03:53.260 --> 03:54.860\n Yeah, yeah, well, so least favorite,\n\n03:54.860 --> 03:56.140\n one that I've been thinking a lot about\n\n03:56.140 --> 03:58.940\n that will be a video I don't know when, but we'll see.\n\n03:59.900 --> 04:02.420\n The number e, we write the function e to the x,\n\n04:02.420 --> 04:04.140\n this general exponential function\n\n04:04.140 --> 04:06.260\n with a notation e to the x\n\n04:06.260 --> 04:08.380\n that implies you should think about a particular number,\n\n04:08.380 --> 04:09.380\n this constant of nature,\n\n04:09.380 --> 04:11.740\n and you repeatedly multiply it by itself.\n\n04:11.740 --> 04:14.100\n And then you say, oh, what's e to the square root of two?\n\n04:14.100 --> 04:15.700\n And you're like, oh, well, we've extended the idea\n\n04:15.700 --> 04:17.020\n of repeated multiplication.\n\n04:17.020 --> 04:19.460\n That's all nice, that's all nice and well.\n\n04:19.460 --> 04:22.660\n But very famously, you have like e to the pi i,\n\n04:22.660 --> 04:24.420\n and you're like, well, we're extending the idea\n\n04:24.420 --> 04:27.060\n of repeated multiplication into the complex numbers.\n\n04:27.060 --> 04:28.780\n Yeah, you can think about it that way.\n\n04:28.780 --> 04:31.820\n In reality, I think that it's just the wrong way\n\n04:31.820 --> 04:34.740\n of notationally representing this function,\n\n04:34.740 --> 04:36.180\n the exponential function,\n\n04:36.180 --> 04:37.820\n which itself could be represented\n\n04:37.820 --> 04:38.780\n a number of different ways.\n\n04:38.780 --> 04:41.300\n You can think about it in terms of the problem it solves,\n\n04:41.300 --> 04:43.260\n a certain very simple differential equation,\n\n04:43.260 --> 04:45.620\n which often yields way more insight\n\n04:45.620 --> 04:48.820\n than trying to twist the idea of repeated multiplication,\n\n04:48.820 --> 04:50.740\n like take its arm and put it behind its back\n\n04:50.740 --> 04:51.940\n and throw it on the desk and be like,\n\n04:51.940 --> 04:53.620\n you will apply to complex numbers, right?\n\n04:53.620 --> 04:56.420\n That's not, I don't think that's pedagogically helpful.\n\n04:57.420 --> 04:59.740\n So the repeated multiplication is actually missing\n\n04:59.740 --> 05:03.020\n the main point, the power of e to the x.\n\n05:03.020 --> 05:05.900\n I mean, what it addresses is things where the rate\n\n05:05.900 --> 05:10.140\n at which something changes depends on its own value,\n\n05:10.140 --> 05:12.500\n but more specifically, it depends on it linearly.\n\n05:12.500 --> 05:15.100\n So for example, if you have like a population\n\n05:15.100 --> 05:16.660\n that's growing and the rate at which it grows\n\n05:16.660 --> 05:18.420\n depends on how many members of the population\n\n05:18.420 --> 05:19.260\n are already there,\n\n05:19.260 --> 05:21.300\n it looks like this nice exponential curve.\n\n05:21.300 --> 05:23.300\n It makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication\n\n05:23.300 --> 05:25.140\n because you say, how much is there after one year,\n\n05:25.140 --> 05:27.420\n two years, three years, you're multiplying by something.\n\n05:27.420 --> 05:29.460\n The relationship can be a little bit different sometimes\n\n05:29.460 --> 05:33.940\n where let's say you've got a ball on a string,\n\n05:33.940 --> 05:37.540\n like a game of tetherball going around a rope, right?\n\n05:37.540 --> 05:40.780\n And you say, its velocity is always perpendicular\n\n05:40.780 --> 05:42.220\n to its position.\n\n05:42.220 --> 05:44.140\n That's another way of describing its rate of change\n\n05:44.140 --> 05:47.100\n is being related to where it is,\n\n05:47.100 --> 05:48.220\n but it's a different operation.\n\n05:48.220 --> 05:49.740\n You're not scaling it, it's a rotation.\n\n05:49.740 --> 05:51.420\n It's this 90 degree rotation.\n\n05:51.420 --> 05:54.580\n That's what the whole idea of like complex exponentiation\n\n05:54.580 --> 05:55.740\n is trying to capture,\n\n05:55.740 --> 05:57.660\n but it's obfuscated in the notation\n\n05:57.660 --> 05:59.060\n when what it's actually saying,\n\n05:59.060 --> 06:01.460\n like if you really parse something like e to the pi i,\n\n06:01.460 --> 06:03.900\n what it's saying is choose an origin,\n\n06:03.900 --> 06:06.500\n always move perpendicular to the vector\n\n06:06.500 --> 06:08.340\n from that origin to you, okay?\n\n06:09.380 --> 06:12.460\n Then when you walk pi times that radius,\n\n06:12.460 --> 06:14.180\n you'll be halfway around.\n\n06:14.180 --> 06:15.860\n Like that's what it's saying.\n\n06:15.860 --> 06:18.620\n It's kind of the, you turn 90 degrees and you walk,\n\n06:18.620 --> 06:19.940\n you'll be going in a circle.\n\n06:19.940 --> 06:22.460\n That's the phenomenon that it's describing,\n\n06:22.460 --> 06:24.380\n but trying to twist the idea\n\n06:24.380 --> 06:26.820\n of repeatedly multiplying a constant into that.\n\n06:26.820 --> 06:30.740\n Like I can't even think of the number of human hours\n\n06:30.740 --> 06:33.420\n of like intelligent human hours that have been wasted\n\n06:33.420 --> 06:36.820\n trying to parse that to their own liking and desire\n\n06:36.820 --> 06:39.500\n among like scientists or electrical engineers\n\n06:39.500 --> 06:40.660\n or students everywhere,\n\n06:40.660 --> 06:42.740\n which if the notation were a little different\n\n06:42.740 --> 06:45.620\n or the way that this whole function was introduced\n\n06:45.620 --> 06:47.620\n from the get go were framed differently,\n\n06:47.620 --> 06:49.980\n I think could have been avoided, right?\n\n06:49.980 --> 06:51.020\n And you're talking about\n\n06:51.020 --> 06:53.420\n the most beautiful equation in mathematics,\n\n06:53.420 --> 06:55.100\n but it's still pretty mysterious, isn't it?\n\n06:55.100 --> 06:58.660\n Like you're making it seem like it's a notational.\n\n06:58.660 --> 06:59.740\n It's not mysterious.\n\n06:59.740 --> 07:01.940\n I think the notation makes it mysterious.\n\n07:01.940 --> 07:04.620\n I don't think it's, I think the fact that it represents,\n\n07:04.620 --> 07:06.340\n it's pretty, it's not like the most beautiful thing\n\n07:06.340 --> 07:07.940\n in the world, but it's quite pretty.\n\n07:07.940 --> 07:10.620\n The idea that if you take the linear operation\n\n07:10.620 --> 07:12.500\n of a 90 degree rotation,\n\n07:12.500 --> 07:15.700\n and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it,\n\n07:15.700 --> 07:18.460\n that what you get are all the other kinds of rotation,\n\n07:19.460 --> 07:20.420\n which is basically to say,\n\n07:20.420 --> 07:22.820\n if your velocity vector is perpendicular\n\n07:22.820 --> 07:25.380\n to your position vector, you walk in a circle,\n\n07:25.380 --> 07:26.340\n that's pretty.\n\n07:26.340 --> 07:27.780\n It's not the most beautiful thing in the world,\n\n07:27.780 --> 07:28.740\n but it's quite pretty.\n\n07:28.740 --> 07:31.220\n The beauty of it, I think comes from perhaps\n\n07:31.220 --> 07:33.060\n the awkwardness of the notation\n\n07:33.060 --> 07:35.460\n somehow still nevertheless coming together nicely,\n\n07:35.460 --> 07:38.780\n because you have like several disciplines coming together\n\n07:38.780 --> 07:40.180\n in a single equation.\n\n07:40.180 --> 07:41.020\n Well, I think.\n\n07:41.020 --> 07:43.500\n In a sense, like historically speaking.\n\n07:43.500 --> 07:44.340\n That's true.\n\n07:44.340 --> 07:45.980\n You've got, so like the number E is significant.\n\n07:45.980 --> 07:47.860\n Like it shows up in probability all the time.\n\n07:47.860 --> 07:49.380\n It like shows up in calculus all the time.\n\n07:49.380 --> 07:50.380\n It is significant.\n\n07:50.380 --> 07:52.300\n You're seeing it sort of mated with pi,\n\n07:52.300 --> 07:54.060\n this geometric constant and I,\n\n07:54.060 --> 07:55.820\n like the imaginary number and such.\n\n07:55.820 --> 07:57.660\n I think what's really happening there\n\n07:57.660 --> 08:01.140\n is the way that E shows up is when you have things\n\n08:01.140 --> 08:03.180\n like exponential growth and decay, right?\n\n08:03.180 --> 08:06.100\n It's when this relation that something's rate of change\n\n08:06.100 --> 08:10.500\n has to itself is a simple scaling, right?\n\n08:10.500 --> 08:14.100\n A similar law also describes circular motion.\n\n08:14.100 --> 08:16.340\n Because we have bad notation,\n\n08:16.340 --> 08:19.100\n we use the residue of how it shows up\n\n08:19.100 --> 08:21.060\n in the context of self reinforcing growth,\n\n08:21.060 --> 08:23.660\n like a population growing or compound interest.\n\n08:23.660 --> 08:25.300\n The constant associated with that\n\n08:25.300 --> 08:27.660\n is awkwardly placed into the context\n\n08:27.660 --> 08:29.740\n of how rotation comes about,\n\n08:29.740 --> 08:32.300\n because they both come from pretty similar equations.\n\n08:32.300 --> 08:36.220\n And so what we see is the E and the pi juxtaposed\n\n08:36.220 --> 08:38.340\n a little bit closer than they would be\n\n08:38.340 --> 08:41.020\n with a purely natural representation, I would think.\n\n08:41.020 --> 08:43.380\n Here's how I would describe the relation between the two.\n\n08:43.380 --> 08:45.820\n You've got a very important function we might call exp.\n\n08:45.820 --> 08:47.780\n That's like the exponential function.\n\n08:47.780 --> 08:49.340\n When you plug in one,\n\n08:49.340 --> 08:50.980\n you get this nice constant called E\n\n08:50.980 --> 08:53.340\n that shows up in like probability and calculus.\n\n08:53.340 --> 08:55.340\n If you try to move in the imaginary direction,\n\n08:55.340 --> 08:58.420\n it's periodic and the period is tau.\n\n08:58.420 --> 08:59.620\n So those are these two constants\n\n08:59.620 --> 09:02.180\n associated with the same central function,\n\n09:02.180 --> 09:04.780\n but for kind of unrelated reasons, right?\n\n09:04.780 --> 09:07.380\n And not unrelated, but like orthogonal reasons.\n\n09:07.380 --> 09:08.340\n One of them is what happens\n\n09:08.340 --> 09:09.700\n when you're moving in the real direction.\n\n09:09.700 --> 09:12.580\n One's what happens when you move in the imaginary direction.\n\n09:12.580 --> 09:14.180\n And like, yeah, those are related.\n\n09:14.180 --> 09:17.180\n They're not as related as the famous equation\n\n09:17.180 --> 09:18.540\n seems to think it is.\n\n09:18.540 --> 09:20.540\n It's sort of putting all of the children in one bed\n\n09:20.540 --> 09:22.500\n and they'd kind of like to sleep in separate beds\n\n09:22.500 --> 09:24.580\n if they had the choice, but you see them all there\n\n09:24.580 --> 09:28.380\n and there is a family resemblance, but it's not that close.\n\n09:28.380 --> 09:31.740\n So actually thinking of it as a function\n\n09:31.740 --> 09:34.740\n is the better idea.\n\n09:34.740 --> 09:36.340\n And that's a notational idea.\n\n09:36.340 --> 09:38.420\n And yeah, and like, here's the thing.\n\n09:39.340 --> 09:41.220\n The constant E sort of stands\n\n09:41.220 --> 09:44.700\n as this numerical representative of calculus, right?\n\n09:44.700 --> 09:47.580\n Calculus is the like study of change.\n\n09:47.580 --> 09:49.860\n So at the very least there's a little cognitive dissonance\n\n09:49.860 --> 09:53.260\n using a constant to represent the science of change.\n\n09:53.260 --> 09:54.140\n I never thought of it that way.\n\n09:54.140 --> 09:54.980\n Yeah.\n\n09:54.980 --> 09:55.820\n Right?\n\n09:55.820 --> 09:56.660\n Yeah.\n\n09:56.660 --> 10:00.180\n It makes sense why the notation came about that way.\n\n10:00.180 --> 10:02.100\n Because this is the first way that we saw it\n\n10:02.100 --> 10:03.860\n in the context of things like population growth\n\n10:03.860 --> 10:04.780\n or compound interest.\n\n10:04.780 --> 10:07.060\n It is nicer to think about as repeated multiplication.\n\n10:07.060 --> 10:08.700\n That's definitely nicer.\n\n10:08.700 --> 10:11.020\n But it's more that that's the first application\n\n10:11.020 --> 10:13.900\n of what turned out to be a much more general function\n\n10:13.900 --> 10:15.220\n that maybe the intelligent life\n\n10:15.220 --> 10:17.180\n your initial question asked about\n\n10:17.180 --> 10:19.780\n would have come to recognize as being much more significant\n\n10:19.780 --> 10:21.140\n than the single use case,\n\n10:21.140 --> 10:24.300\n which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation.\n\n10:24.300 --> 10:28.500\n But let me jump back for a second to aliens\n\n10:28.500 --> 10:30.060\n and the nature of our universe.\n\n10:30.060 --> 10:30.900\n Okay.\n\n10:31.940 --> 10:35.100\n Do you think math is discovered or invented?\n\n10:35.100 --> 10:37.620\n So we're talking about the different kind of mathematics\n\n10:37.620 --> 10:40.620\n that could be developed by the alien species.\n\n10:40.620 --> 10:42.380\n The implied question is,\n\n10:44.300 --> 10:46.220\n yeah, is math discovered or invented?\n\n10:46.220 --> 10:49.660\n Is fundamentally everybody going to discover\n\n10:49.660 --> 10:53.140\n the same principles of mathematics?\n\n10:53.140 --> 10:54.140\n So the way I think about it,\n\n10:54.140 --> 10:55.380\n and everyone thinks about it differently,\n\n10:55.380 --> 10:56.420\n but here's my take.\n\n10:56.420 --> 10:57.940\n I think there's a cycle at play\n\n10:57.940 --> 11:00.980\n where you discover things about the universe\n\n11:00.980 --> 11:03.980\n that tell you what math will be useful.\n\n11:03.980 --> 11:08.060\n And that math itself is invented in a sense,\n\n11:08.060 --> 11:11.420\n but of all the possible maths that you could have invented,\n\n11:11.420 --> 11:12.740\n it's discoveries about the world\n\n11:12.740 --> 11:14.220\n that tell you which ones are.\n\n11:14.220 --> 11:17.780\n So like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem.\n\n11:17.780 --> 11:18.620\n When you look at this,\n\n11:18.620 --> 11:19.780\n do you think of that as a definition\n\n11:19.780 --> 11:21.940\n or do you think of that as a discovery?\n\n11:21.940 --> 11:24.300\n From the historical perspective, right, it's a discovery\n\n11:24.300 --> 11:25.140\n because they were,\n\n11:25.140 --> 11:29.620\n but that's probably because they were using physical object\n\n11:29.620 --> 11:31.140\n to build their intuition.\n\n11:32.260 --> 11:34.500\n And from that intuition came the mathematics.\n\n11:34.500 --> 11:37.340\n So the mathematics wasn't in some abstract world\n\n11:37.340 --> 11:39.060\n detached from physics,\n\n11:39.060 --> 11:43.700\n but I think more and more math has become detached from,\n\n11:43.700 --> 11:46.140\n you know, when you even look at modern physics\n\n11:46.140 --> 11:49.580\n from string theory to even general relativity,\n\n11:49.580 --> 11:53.580\n I mean, all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics\n\n11:53.580 --> 11:58.460\n kind of takes a brisk walk outside of what our mind\n\n11:58.460 --> 12:00.500\n can actually even comprehend\n\n12:00.500 --> 12:02.380\n in multiple dimensions, for example,\n\n12:02.380 --> 12:05.940\n anything beyond three dimensions, maybe four dimensions.\n\n12:05.940 --> 12:07.300\n No, no, no, no, higher dimensions\n\n12:07.300 --> 12:08.780\n can be highly, highly applicable.\n\n12:08.780 --> 12:11.260\n I think this is a common misinterpretation\n\n12:11.260 --> 12:13.380\n that if you're asking questions\n\n12:13.380 --> 12:15.260\n about like a five dimensional manifold,\n\n12:15.260 --> 12:16.740\n that the only way that that's connected\n\n12:16.740 --> 12:20.220\n to the physical world is if the physical world is itself\n\n12:20.220 --> 12:22.980\n a five dimensional manifold or includes them.\n\n12:22.980 --> 12:25.260\n Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\n12:25.260 --> 12:27.220\n You're telling me you can imagine\n\n12:28.940 --> 12:31.260\n a five dimensional manifold?\n\n12:31.260 --> 12:33.380\n No, no, that's not what I said.\n\n12:33.380 --> 12:35.020\n I would make the claim that it is useful\n\n12:35.020 --> 12:37.260\n to a three dimensional physical universe,\n\n12:37.260 --> 12:39.460\n despite itself not being three dimensional.\n\n12:39.460 --> 12:41.220\n So it's useful meaning to even understand\n\n12:41.220 --> 12:42.740\n a three dimensional world,\n\n12:42.740 --> 12:44.940\n it'd be useful to have five dimensional manifolds.\n\n12:44.940 --> 12:47.180\n Yes, absolutely, because of state spaces.\n\n12:47.180 --> 12:50.540\n But you're saying there in some deep way for us humans,\n\n12:50.540 --> 12:54.060\n it does always come back to that three dimensional world\n\n12:54.060 --> 12:56.620\n for the usefulness that the dimensional world\n\n12:56.620 --> 12:59.980\n and therefore it starts with a discovery,\n\n12:59.980 --> 13:02.060\n but then we invent the mathematics\n\n13:02.060 --> 13:06.260\n that helps us make sense of the discovery in a sense.\n\n13:06.260 --> 13:07.900\n Yes, I mean, just to jump off\n\n13:07.900 --> 13:09.820\n of the Pythagorean theorem example,\n\n13:09.820 --> 13:11.220\n it feels like a discovery.\n\n13:11.220 --> 13:12.900\n You've got these beautiful geometric proofs\n\n13:12.900 --> 13:14.620\n where you've got squares and you're modifying the areas,\n\n13:14.620 --> 13:16.740\n it feels like a discovery.\n\n13:16.740 --> 13:19.620\n If you look at how we formalize the idea of 2D space\n\n13:19.620 --> 13:23.100\n as being R2, right, all pairs of real numbers,\n\n13:23.100 --> 13:25.740\n and how we define a metric on it and define distance,\n\n13:25.740 --> 13:26.700\n you're like, hang on a second,\n\n13:26.700 --> 13:28.100\n we've defined a distance\n\n13:28.100 --> 13:30.100\n so that the Pythagorean theorem is true,\n\n13:30.100 --> 13:32.460\n so that suddenly it doesn't feel that great.\n\n13:32.460 --> 13:35.420\n But I think what's going on is the thing that informed us\n\n13:35.420 --> 13:38.020\n what metric to put on R2,\n\n13:38.020 --> 13:41.380\n to put on our abstract representation of 2D space,\n\n13:41.380 --> 13:43.300\n came from physical observations.\n\n13:43.300 --> 13:44.660\n And the thing is, there's other metrics\n\n13:44.660 --> 13:45.500\n you could have put on it.\n\n13:45.500 --> 13:47.180\n We could have consistent math\n\n13:47.180 --> 13:49.140\n with other notions of distance,\n\n13:49.140 --> 13:50.860\n it's just that those pieces of math\n\n13:50.860 --> 13:53.660\n wouldn't be applicable to the physical world that we study\n\n13:53.660 --> 13:54.580\n because they're not the ones\n\n13:54.580 --> 13:56.180\n where the Pythagorean theorem holds.\n\n13:56.180 --> 13:59.060\n So we have a discovery, a genuine bonafide discovery\n\n13:59.060 --> 14:00.500\n that informed the invention,\n\n14:00.500 --> 14:03.700\n the invention of an abstract representation of 2D space\n\n14:03.700 --> 14:06.220\n that we call R2 and things like that.\n\n14:06.220 --> 14:07.300\n And then from there,\n\n14:07.300 --> 14:09.740\n you just study R2 as an abstract thing\n\n14:09.740 --> 14:12.500\n that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries\n\n14:12.500 --> 14:14.420\n which themselves might yield discoveries.\n\n14:14.420 --> 14:16.980\n Those discoveries might give you insight\n\n14:16.980 --> 14:19.380\n as to what else would be useful to invent\n\n14:19.380 --> 14:20.980\n and it kind of feeds on itself that way.\n\n14:20.980 --> 14:22.180\n That's how I think about it.\n\n14:22.180 --> 14:24.140\n So it's not an either or.\n\n14:24.140 --> 14:25.380\n It's not that math is one of these\n\n14:25.380 --> 14:26.780\n or it's one of the others.\n\n14:26.780 --> 14:29.180\n At different times, it's playing a different role.\n\n14:29.180 --> 14:34.180\n So then let me ask the Richard Feynman question then,\n\n14:34.460 --> 14:36.220\n along that thread,\n\n14:36.220 --> 14:37.380\n is what do you think is the difference\n\n14:37.380 --> 14:40.300\n between physics and math?\n\n14:40.300 --> 14:43.060\n There's a giant overlap.\n\n14:43.060 --> 14:45.940\n There's a kind of intuition that physicists have\n\n14:45.940 --> 14:49.020\n about the world that's perhaps outside of mathematics.\n\n14:49.020 --> 14:52.700\n It's this mysterious art that they seem to possess,\n\n14:52.700 --> 14:54.220\n we humans generally possess.\n\n14:54.220 --> 14:58.060\n And then there's the beautiful rigor of mathematics\n\n14:58.060 --> 15:01.820\n that allows you to, I mean, just like as we were saying,\n\n15:02.860 --> 15:07.860\n invent frameworks of understanding our physical world.\n\n15:07.860 --> 15:10.180\n So what do you think is the difference there\n\n15:10.180 --> 15:11.340\n and how big is it?\n\n15:11.340 --> 15:12.980\n Well, I think of math as being the study\n\n15:12.980 --> 15:16.860\n of abstractions over patterns and pure patterns in logic.\n\n15:16.860 --> 15:19.300\n And then physics is obviously grounded in a desire\n\n15:19.300 --> 15:22.180\n to understand the world that we live in.\n\n15:22.180 --> 15:23.540\n I think you're gonna get very different answers\n\n15:23.540 --> 15:25.060\n when you talk to different mathematicians\n\n15:25.060 --> 15:27.620\n because there's a wide diversity in types of mathematicians.\n\n15:27.620 --> 15:30.980\n There are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles.\n\n15:30.980 --> 15:33.540\n They might be turned on by things like combinatorics.\n\n15:33.540 --> 15:35.860\n And they just love the idea of building up\n\n15:35.860 --> 15:40.420\n a set of problem solving tools applying to pure patterns.\n\n15:40.420 --> 15:42.820\n There are some who are very physically motivated,\n\n15:42.820 --> 15:47.820\n who try to invent new math or discover math in veins\n\n15:48.180 --> 15:50.500\n that they know will have applications to physics\n\n15:50.500 --> 15:51.860\n or sometimes computer science.\n\n15:51.860 --> 15:53.340\n And that's what drives them.\n\n15:53.340 --> 15:55.100\n Like chaos theory is a good example of something\n\n15:55.100 --> 15:57.180\n that's pure math, that's purely mathematical.\n\n15:57.180 --> 15:58.700\n A lot of the statements being made,\n\n15:58.700 --> 16:02.420\n but it's heavily motivated by specific applications\n\n16:02.420 --> 16:04.860\n to largely physics.\n\n16:04.860 --> 16:06.660\n And then you have a type of mathematician\n\n16:06.660 --> 16:08.500\n who just loves abstraction.\n\n16:08.500 --> 16:10.500\n They just love pulling it to the more and more abstract\n\n16:10.500 --> 16:12.100\n things, the things that feel powerful.\n\n16:12.100 --> 16:15.220\n These are the ones that initially invented like topology\n\n16:15.220 --> 16:17.500\n and then later on get really into category theory\n\n16:17.500 --> 16:20.380\n and go on about like infinite categories and whatnot.\n\n16:20.380 --> 16:23.460\n These are the ones that love to have a system\n\n16:23.460 --> 16:27.140\n that can describe truths about as many things as possible.\n\n16:28.700 --> 16:31.300\n People from those three different veins of motivation\n\n16:31.300 --> 16:32.860\n into math are gonna give you very different answers\n\n16:32.860 --> 16:34.740\n about what the relation at play here is.\n\n16:34.740 --> 16:37.660\n Cause someone like Vladimir Arnold,\n\n16:37.660 --> 16:40.540\n who has written a lot of great books,\n\n16:40.540 --> 16:42.500\n many about like differential equations and such,\n\n16:42.500 --> 16:45.700\n he would say, math is a branch of physics.\n\n16:45.700 --> 16:47.180\n That's how he would think about it.\n\n16:47.180 --> 16:48.220\n And of course he was studying\n\n16:48.220 --> 16:49.780\n like differential equations related things\n\n16:49.780 --> 16:52.260\n because that is the motivator behind the study\n\n16:52.260 --> 16:53.820\n of PDEs and things like that.\n\n16:54.820 --> 16:56.500\n But you'll have others who,\n\n16:56.500 --> 16:58.260\n like especially the category theorists\n\n16:58.260 --> 17:01.380\n who aren't really thinking about physics necessarily.\n\n17:01.380 --> 17:04.540\n It's all about abstraction and the power of generality.\n\n17:04.540 --> 17:06.460\n And it's more of a happy coincidence\n\n17:06.460 --> 17:08.340\n that that ends up being useful\n\n17:08.340 --> 17:10.900\n for understanding the world we live in.\n\n17:10.900 --> 17:12.860\n And then you can get into like, why is that the case?\n\n17:12.860 --> 17:14.140\n It's sort of surprising\n\n17:14.140 --> 17:17.820\n that that which is about pure puzzles and abstraction\n\n17:17.820 --> 17:21.060\n also happens to describe the very fundamentals\n\n17:21.060 --> 17:23.140\n of quarks and everything else.\n\n17:24.180 --> 17:27.900\n So why do you think the fundamentals of quarks\n\n17:28.820 --> 17:33.260\n and the nature of reality is so compressible\n\n17:33.260 --> 17:35.380\n into clean, beautiful equations\n\n17:35.380 --> 17:39.300\n that are for the most part simple, relatively speaking,\n\n17:39.300 --> 17:41.740\n a lot simpler than they could be?\n\n17:41.740 --> 17:45.380\n So you have, we mentioned somebody like Stephen Wolfram\n\n17:45.380 --> 17:50.380\n who thinks that sort of there's incredibly simple rules\n\n17:50.540 --> 17:51.940\n underlying our reality,\n\n17:51.940 --> 17:54.940\n but it can create arbitrary complexity.\n\n17:54.940 --> 17:56.780\n But there is simple equations.\n\n17:56.780 --> 17:59.220\n What, I'm asking a million questions\n\n17:59.220 --> 18:01.060\n that nobody knows the answer to, but.\n\n18:01.060 --> 18:04.300\n I have no idea, why is it simple?\n\n18:05.300 --> 18:07.100\n It could be the case that\n\n18:07.100 --> 18:08.500\n there's like a filter iteration at play.\n\n18:08.500 --> 18:10.660\n The only things that physicists find interesting\n\n18:10.660 --> 18:11.700\n are the ones that are simple enough\n\n18:11.700 --> 18:13.340\n they could describe it mathematically.\n\n18:13.340 --> 18:15.180\n But as soon as it's a sufficiently complex system,\n\n18:15.180 --> 18:16.940\n like, oh, that's outside the realm of physics,\n\n18:16.940 --> 18:19.340\n that's biology or whatever have you.\n\n18:19.340 --> 18:21.660\n And of course, that's true.\n\n18:21.660 --> 18:22.740\n Maybe there's something where it's like,\n\n18:22.740 --> 18:26.540\n of course there will always be something that is simple\n\n18:26.540 --> 18:31.420\n when you wash away the like non important parts\n\n18:31.420 --> 18:33.420\n of whatever it is that you're studying.\n\n18:33.420 --> 18:35.180\n Just from like an information theory standpoint,\n\n18:35.180 --> 18:36.660\n there might be some like,\n\n18:36.660 --> 18:39.460\n you get to the lowest information component of it.\n\n18:39.460 --> 18:40.900\n But I don't know, maybe I'm just having\n\n18:40.900 --> 18:43.020\n a really hard time conceiving of what it would even mean\n\n18:43.020 --> 18:46.580\n for the fundamental laws to be like intrinsically\n\n18:46.580 --> 18:50.660\n complicated, like some set of equations\n\n18:50.660 --> 18:52.580\n that you can't decouple from each other.\n\n18:52.580 --> 18:56.820\n Well, no, it could be that sort of we take for granted\n\n18:56.820 --> 18:59.980\n that the laws of physics, for example,\n\n18:59.980 --> 19:03.500\n are for the most part the same everywhere\n\n19:03.500 --> 19:05.340\n or something like that, right?\n\n19:05.340 --> 19:10.340\n As opposed to the sort of an alternative could be\n\n19:10.620 --> 19:15.420\n that the rules under which the world operates\n\n19:15.420 --> 19:17.260\n is different everywhere.\n\n19:17.260 --> 19:20.340\n It's like a deeply distributed system\n\n19:20.340 --> 19:23.380\n where just everything is just chaos,\n\n19:23.380 --> 19:25.540\n not in a strict definition of chaos,\n\n19:25.540 --> 19:30.420\n but meaning like just it's impossible for equations\n\n19:30.420 --> 19:34.020\n to capture, for to explicitly model the world\n\n19:34.020 --> 19:36.020\n as cleanly as the physical does.\n\n19:36.020 --> 19:39.100\n I mean, we almost take it for granted that we can describe,\n\n19:39.100 --> 19:41.260\n we can have an equation for gravity,\n\n19:41.260 --> 19:42.780\n for action at a distance.\n\n19:42.780 --> 19:45.500\n We can have equations for some of these basic ways\n\n19:45.500 --> 19:46.580\n the planet's moving.\n\n19:46.580 --> 19:51.580\n Just the low level at the atomic scale,\n\n19:52.060 --> 19:53.980\n how the materials operate,\n\n19:53.980 --> 19:56.940\n at the high scale, how black holes operate.\n\n19:56.940 --> 19:59.820\n But it doesn't, it seems like it could be,\n\n19:59.820 --> 20:01.700\n there's infinite other possibilities\n\n20:01.700 --> 20:05.020\n where none of it could be compressible into such equations.\n\n20:05.020 --> 20:06.540\n So it just seems beautiful.\n\n20:06.540 --> 20:10.900\n It's also weird, probably to the point you're making,\n\n20:10.900 --> 20:15.140\n that it's very pleasant that this is true for our minds.\n\n20:15.140 --> 20:17.140\n So it might be that our minds are biased\n\n20:17.140 --> 20:19.660\n to just be looking at the parts of the universe\n\n20:19.660 --> 20:21.740\n that are compressible.\n\n20:21.740 --> 20:23.740\n And then we can publish papers on\n\n20:23.740 --> 20:26.460\n and have nice E equals empty squared equations.\n\n20:26.460 --> 20:29.260\n Right, well, I wonder would such a world\n\n20:29.260 --> 20:33.580\n with uncompressible laws allow for the kind of beings\n\n20:33.580 --> 20:35.940\n that can think about the kind of questions\n\n20:35.940 --> 20:36.860\n that you're asking?\n\n20:37.780 --> 20:38.620\n That's true.\n\n20:38.620 --> 20:40.620\n Right, like an anthropic principle coming into play\n\n20:40.620 --> 20:42.580\n in some weird way here?\n\n20:42.580 --> 20:44.780\n I don't know, like I don't know what I'm talking about at all.\n\n20:44.780 --> 20:47.980\n Maybe the universe is actually not so compressible,\n\n20:47.980 --> 20:52.540\n but the way our brain, the way our brain evolved\n\n20:52.540 --> 20:55.860\n we're only able to perceive the compressible parts.\n\n20:55.860 --> 20:58.380\n I mean, we are, so this is the sort of Chomsky argument.\n\n20:58.380 --> 20:59.860\n We are just descendants of apes\n\n20:59.860 --> 21:03.580\n over like really limited biological systems.\n\n21:03.580 --> 21:04.660\n So it totally makes sense\n\n21:04.660 --> 21:08.580\n that we're really limited little computers, calculators,\n\n21:08.580 --> 21:10.220\n that are able to perceive certain kinds of things\n\n21:10.220 --> 21:13.100\n and the actual world is much more complicated.\n\n21:13.100 --> 21:16.620\n Well, but we can do pretty awesome things, right?\n\n21:16.620 --> 21:18.260\n Like we can fly spaceships\n\n21:18.260 --> 21:21.540\n and we have to have some connection of reality\n\n21:21.540 --> 21:25.260\n to be able to take our potentially oversimplified models\n\n21:25.260 --> 21:27.740\n of the world, but then actually twist the world\n\n21:27.740 --> 21:29.060\n to our will based on it.\n\n21:29.060 --> 21:30.380\n So we have certain reality checks\n\n21:30.380 --> 21:33.380\n that like physics isn't too far a field\n\n21:33.380 --> 21:35.420\n simply based on what we can do.\n\n21:35.420 --> 21:37.260\n Yeah, the fact that we can fly is pretty good.\n\n21:37.260 --> 21:40.500\n It's great, yeah, like it's a proof of concept\n\n21:40.500 --> 21:44.900\n that the laws we're working with are working well.\n\n21:44.900 --> 21:47.740\n So I mentioned to the internet that I'm talking to you\n\n21:47.740 --> 21:50.180\n and so the internet gave some questions.\n\n21:50.180 --> 21:51.580\n So I apologize for these,\n\n21:51.580 --> 21:54.540\n but do you think we're living in a simulation\n\n21:54.540 --> 21:56.940\n that the universe is a computer\n\n21:56.940 --> 22:00.020\n or the universe is a computation running on a computer?\n\n22:01.260 --> 22:02.700\n It's conceivable.\n\n22:02.700 --> 22:05.700\n What I don't buy is, you know, you'll have the argument\n\n22:05.700 --> 22:07.900\n that, well, let's say that it was the case\n\n22:07.900 --> 22:09.540\n that you can have simulations.\n\n22:09.540 --> 22:12.580\n Then the simulated world would itself\n\n22:12.580 --> 22:15.380\n eventually get to a point where it's running simulations.\n\n22:15.380 --> 22:17.220\n And then the second layer down\n\n22:17.220 --> 22:19.420\n would create a third layer down and on and on and on.\n\n22:19.420 --> 22:21.620\n So probabilistically, you just throw a dart\n\n22:21.620 --> 22:22.460\n at one of those layers,\n\n22:22.460 --> 22:24.940\n we're probably in one of the simulated layers.\n\n22:24.940 --> 22:27.060\n I think if there's some sort of limitations\n\n22:27.060 --> 22:28.580\n on like the information processing\n\n22:28.580 --> 22:31.420\n of whatever the physical world is,\n\n22:31.420 --> 22:32.700\n like it quickly becomes the case\n\n22:32.700 --> 22:35.620\n that you have a limit to the layers that could exist there\n\n22:35.620 --> 22:38.100\n because like the resources necessary\n\n22:38.100 --> 22:41.660\n to simulate a universe like ours clearly is a lot\n\n22:41.660 --> 22:43.700\n just in terms of the number of bits at play.\n\n22:43.700 --> 22:46.820\n And so then you can ask, well, what's more plausible?\n\n22:46.820 --> 22:49.140\n That there's an unbounded capacity\n\n22:49.140 --> 22:50.340\n of information processing\n\n22:50.340 --> 22:53.620\n in whatever the like highest up level universe is,\n\n22:53.620 --> 22:56.060\n or that there's some bound to that capacity,\n\n22:56.060 --> 22:58.860\n which then limits like the number of levels available.\n\n22:58.860 --> 23:00.820\n How do you play some kind of probability distribution\n\n23:00.820 --> 23:02.580\n on like what the information capacity is?\n\n23:02.580 --> 23:03.740\n I have no idea.\n\n23:03.740 --> 23:06.860\n But I don't, like people almost assume\n\n23:06.860 --> 23:08.340\n a certain uniform probability\n\n23:08.340 --> 23:11.900\n over all of those meta layers that could conceivably exist\n\n23:11.900 --> 23:15.180\n when it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager\n\n23:15.180 --> 23:16.980\n on like you're not giving a low enough prior\n\n23:16.980 --> 23:20.900\n to the mere existence of that infinite set of layers.\n\n23:20.900 --> 23:21.740\n Yeah, that's true.\n\n23:21.740 --> 23:25.060\n But it's also very difficult to contextualize the amount.\n\n23:25.060 --> 23:28.260\n So the amount of information processing power\n\n23:28.260 --> 23:31.380\n required to simulate like our universe\n\n23:31.380 --> 23:34.260\n seems like amazingly huge.\n\n23:34.260 --> 23:36.940\n But you can always raise two to the power of that.\n\n23:36.940 --> 23:40.460\n Yeah, like numbers get big.\n\n23:40.460 --> 23:41.780\n And we're easily humbled\n\n23:41.780 --> 23:43.700\n by basically everything around us.\n\n23:43.700 --> 23:48.700\n So it's very difficult to kind of make sense of anything\n\n23:49.300 --> 23:50.980\n actually when you look up at the sky\n\n23:50.980 --> 23:53.500\n and look at the stars and the immensity of it all,\n\n23:53.500 --> 23:57.020\n to make sense of the smallness of us,\n\n23:57.020 --> 23:58.780\n the unlikeliness of everything\n\n23:58.780 --> 24:02.180\n that's on this earth coming to be,\n\n24:02.180 --> 24:04.940\n then you could basically anything could be,\n\n24:04.940 --> 24:09.100\n all laws of probability go out the window to me\n\n24:09.100 --> 24:14.100\n because I guess because the amount of information\n\n24:14.140 --> 24:17.540\n under which we're operating is very low.\n\n24:17.540 --> 24:22.100\n We basically know nothing about the world around us,\n\n24:22.100 --> 24:23.380\n relatively speaking.\n\n24:23.380 --> 24:26.580\n And so when I think about the simulation hypothesis,\n\n24:26.580 --> 24:29.220\n I think it's just fun to think about it.\n\n24:29.220 --> 24:31.860\n But it's also, I think there is a thought experiment\n\n24:31.860 --> 24:35.220\n kind of interesting to think of the power of computation,\n\n24:35.220 --> 24:38.940\n whether the limits of a Turing machine,\n\n24:38.940 --> 24:41.020\n sort of the limits of our current computers,\n\n24:41.020 --> 24:44.060\n when you start to think about artificial intelligence,\n\n24:44.060 --> 24:45.960\n how far can we get with computers?\n\n24:46.820 --> 24:50.820\n And that's kind of where the simulation hypothesis\n\n24:50.820 --> 24:52.820\n used with me as a thought experiment\n\n24:52.820 --> 24:55.120\n is the universe just a computer?\n\n24:56.660 --> 24:58.620\n Is it just a computation?\n\n24:58.620 --> 25:00.500\n Is all of this just a computation?\n\n25:00.500 --> 25:02.340\n And sort of the same kind of tools we apply\n\n25:02.340 --> 25:05.100\n to analyzing algorithms, can that be applied?\n\n25:05.100 --> 25:07.340\n If we scale further and further and further,\n\n25:07.340 --> 25:09.620\n will the arbitrary power of those systems\n\n25:09.620 --> 25:12.020\n start to create some interesting aspects\n\n25:12.020 --> 25:13.880\n that we see in our universe?\n\n25:13.880 --> 25:15.980\n Or is something fundamentally different\n\n25:15.980 --> 25:17.500\n needs to be created?\n\n25:17.500 --> 25:20.380\n Well, it's interesting that in our universe,\n\n25:20.380 --> 25:22.700\n it's not arbitrarily large, the power,\n\n25:22.700 --> 25:24.340\n that you can place limits on, for example,\n\n25:24.340 --> 25:27.300\n how many bits of information can be stored per unit area.\n\n25:27.300 --> 25:30.360\n Right, like all of the physical laws,\n\n25:30.360 --> 25:32.680\n you've got general relativity and quantum coming together\n\n25:32.680 --> 25:36.600\n to give you a certain limit on how many bits you can store\n\n25:36.600 --> 25:40.440\n within a given range before it collapses into a black hole.\n\n25:40.440 --> 25:42.760\n The idea that there even exists such a limit\n\n25:42.760 --> 25:44.600\n is at the very least thought provoking,\n\n25:44.600 --> 25:46.960\n when naively you might assume,\n\n25:46.960 --> 25:49.240\n oh, well, technology could always get better and better,\n\n25:49.240 --> 25:50.920\n we could get cleverer and cleverer,\n\n25:50.920 --> 25:54.140\n and you could just cram as much information as you want\n\n25:54.140 --> 25:59.140\n into like a small unit of space, that makes me think,\n\n26:01.040 --> 26:06.040\n it's at least plausible that whatever the highest level\n\n26:06.080 --> 26:10.440\n of existence is doesn't admit too many simulations\n\n26:10.440 --> 26:12.200\n or ones that are at the scale of complexity\n\n26:12.200 --> 26:13.400\n that we're looking at.\n\n26:13.400 --> 26:15.360\n Obviously, it's just as conceivable that they do\n\n26:15.360 --> 26:20.080\n and that there are many, but I guess what I'm channeling\n\n26:20.080 --> 26:22.560\n is the surprise that I felt upon learning that fact,\n\n26:22.560 --> 26:26.120\n that there are, that information is physical in this way.\n\n26:26.120 --> 26:27.120\n There's a finiteness to it.\n\n26:27.120 --> 26:29.420\n Okay, let me just even go off on that.\n\n26:29.420 --> 26:31.320\n From a mathematics perspective\n\n26:31.320 --> 26:35.040\n and a psychology perspective, how do you mix,\n\n26:35.040 --> 26:38.200\n are you psychologically comfortable\n\n26:38.200 --> 26:39.760\n with the concept of infinity?\n\n26:40.800 --> 26:41.640\n I think so.\n\n26:41.640 --> 26:42.460\n Are you okay with it?\n\n26:42.460 --> 26:43.680\n I'm pretty okay, yeah.\n\n26:43.680 --> 26:44.560\n Are you okay?\n\n26:44.560 --> 26:47.180\n No, not really, it doesn't make any sense to me.\n\n26:47.180 --> 26:50.040\n I don't know, like how many words,\n\n26:50.040 --> 26:52.560\n how many possible words do you think could exist\n\n26:53.480 --> 26:55.700\n that are just like strings of letters?\n\n26:55.700 --> 26:59.600\n So that's a sort of mathematical statement as beautiful\n\n26:59.600 --> 27:02.300\n and we use infinity in basically everything we do,\n\n27:03.520 --> 27:06.880\n everything we do in science, math, and engineering, yes.\n\n27:06.880 --> 27:11.880\n But you said exist, the question is,\n\n27:12.040 --> 27:13.360\n you said letters or words?\n\n27:13.360 --> 27:14.560\n I said words. Words.\n\n27:16.440 --> 27:18.200\n To bring words into existence to me,\n\n27:18.200 --> 27:20.920\n you have to start like saying them or like writing them\n\n27:20.920 --> 27:22.040\n or like listing them.\n\n27:22.040 --> 27:23.240\n That's an instantiation.\n\n27:23.240 --> 27:25.800\n Okay, how many abstract words exist?\n\n27:25.800 --> 27:28.080\n Well, the idea of an abstract.\n\n27:28.080 --> 27:31.000\n The idea of abstract notions and ideas.\n\n27:31.000 --> 27:33.120\n I think we should be clear on terminology.\n\n27:33.120 --> 27:35.200\n I mean, you think about intelligence a lot,\n\n27:35.200 --> 27:36.640\n like artificial intelligence.\n\n27:37.860 --> 27:39.120\n Would you not say that what it's doing\n\n27:39.120 --> 27:40.440\n is a kind of abstraction?\n\n27:40.440 --> 27:42.280\n That like abstraction is key\n\n27:42.280 --> 27:45.120\n to conceptualizing the universe?\n\n27:45.120 --> 27:47.300\n You get this raw sensory data.\n\n27:47.300 --> 27:49.240\n I need something that every time you move your face\n\n27:49.240 --> 27:51.620\n a little bit and they're not pixels,\n\n27:51.620 --> 27:55.200\n but like analog of pixels on my retina changed entirely,\n\n27:55.200 --> 27:58.040\n that I can still have some coherent notion of this is Lex,\n\n27:58.040 --> 27:59.720\n I'm talking to Lex, right?\n\n27:59.720 --> 28:01.720\n What that requires is you have a disparate set\n\n28:01.720 --> 28:03.580\n of possible images hitting me\n\n28:03.580 --> 28:07.580\n that are unified in a notion of Lex, right?\n\n28:07.580 --> 28:08.680\n That's a kind of abstraction.\n\n28:08.680 --> 28:09.820\n It's a thing that could apply\n\n28:09.820 --> 28:12.400\n to a lot of different images that I see\n\n28:12.400 --> 28:15.280\n and it represents it in a much more compressed way\n\n28:15.280 --> 28:17.440\n and one that's like much more resilient to that.\n\n28:17.440 --> 28:18.360\n I think in the same way,\n\n28:18.360 --> 28:21.080\n if I'm talking about infinity as an abstraction,\n\n28:21.080 --> 28:23.820\n I don't mean nonphysical woo woo,\n\n28:24.960 --> 28:26.360\n like ineffable or something.\n\n28:26.360 --> 28:28.360\n What I mean is it's something that can apply\n\n28:28.360 --> 28:30.160\n to a multiplicity of situations\n\n28:30.160 --> 28:31.660\n that share a certain common attribute\n\n28:31.660 --> 28:33.720\n in the same way that the images of like your face\n\n28:33.720 --> 28:35.820\n on my retina share enough common attributes\n\n28:35.820 --> 28:37.700\n that I can put the single notion to it.\n\n28:37.700 --> 28:40.780\n Like in that way, infinity is an abstraction\n\n28:40.780 --> 28:43.260\n and it's very powerful and it's only through\n\n28:43.260 --> 28:45.680\n such abstractions that we can actually understand\n\n28:45.680 --> 28:47.560\n like the world and logic and things.\n\n28:47.560 --> 28:48.560\n And in the case of infinity,\n\n28:48.560 --> 28:49.400\n the way I think about it,\n\n28:49.400 --> 28:51.760\n the key entity is the property\n\n28:51.760 --> 28:54.080\n of always being able to add one more.\n\n28:54.080 --> 28:56.120\n Like no matter how many words you can list,\n\n28:56.120 --> 28:57.720\n you just throw an A at the end of one\n\n28:57.720 --> 28:59.760\n and you have another conceivable word.\n\n28:59.760 --> 29:01.680\n You don't have to think of all the words at once.\n\n29:01.680 --> 29:04.840\n It's that property, the oh, I could always add one more\n\n29:04.840 --> 29:08.200\n that gives it this nature of infiniteness\n\n29:08.200 --> 29:09.760\n in the same way that there's certain like properties\n\n29:09.760 --> 29:13.720\n of your face that give it the Lexness, right?\n\n29:13.720 --> 29:16.480\n So like infinity should be no more worrying\n\n29:16.480 --> 29:19.760\n than the I can always add one more sentiment.\n\n29:19.760 --> 29:21.600\n That's a really elegant,\n\n29:21.600 --> 29:23.720\n much more elegant way than I could put it.\n\n29:23.720 --> 29:26.840\n So thank you for doing that as yet another abstraction.\n\n29:26.840 --> 29:29.440\n And yes, indeed, that's what our brain does.\n\n29:29.440 --> 29:30.640\n That's what intelligent systems do.\n\n29:30.640 --> 29:31.840\n That's what programming does.\n\n29:31.840 --> 29:34.680\n That's what science does is build abstraction\n\n29:34.680 --> 29:35.760\n on top of each other.\n\n29:35.760 --> 29:39.560\n And yet there is at a certain point abstractions\n\n29:39.560 --> 29:42.800\n that go into the quote woo, right?\n\n29:42.800 --> 29:47.800\n Sort of, and because we're now,\n\n29:47.920 --> 29:52.460\n it's like we built this stack of, you know,\n\n29:52.460 --> 29:54.680\n the only thing that's true is the stuff that's on the ground.\n\n29:54.680 --> 29:57.480\n Everything else is useful for interpreting this.\n\n29:57.480 --> 30:00.000\n And at a certain point you might start floating\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:04.600\n into ideas that are surreal and difficult\n\n30:04.600 --> 30:08.120\n and take us into areas that are disconnected\n\n30:08.120 --> 30:11.080\n from reality in a way that we could never get back.\n\n30:11.080 --> 30:13.160\n What if instead of calling these abstract,\n\n30:13.160 --> 30:14.640\n how different would it be in your mind\n\n30:14.640 --> 30:15.960\n if we called them general?\n\n30:15.960 --> 30:17.400\n And the phenomenon that you're describing\n\n30:17.400 --> 30:19.080\n is overgeneralization.\n\n30:19.080 --> 30:21.720\n When you try to have a concept or an idea\n\n30:21.720 --> 30:24.760\n that's so general as to apply to nothing in particular\n\n30:24.760 --> 30:27.960\n in a useful way, does that map to what you're thinking\n\n30:27.960 --> 30:28.800\n of when you think of?\n\n30:28.800 --> 30:31.480\n First of all, I'm playing little just for the fun of it.\n\n30:31.480 --> 30:32.400\n Devil's advocate.\n\n30:32.400 --> 30:37.400\n And I think our cognition, our mind is unable\n\n30:37.400 --> 30:39.000\n to visualize.\n\n30:39.000 --> 30:42.520\n So you do some incredible work with visualization and video.\n\n30:42.520 --> 30:46.800\n I think infinity is very difficult to visualize\n\n30:46.800 --> 30:48.240\n for our mind.\n\n30:48.240 --> 30:52.880\n We can delude ourselves into thinking we can visualize it,\n\n30:52.880 --> 30:54.480\n but we can't.\n\n30:54.480 --> 30:56.120\n I don't, I mean, I don't,\n\n30:56.120 --> 30:57.680\n I would venture to say it's very difficult.\n\n30:57.680 --> 31:00.440\n And so there's some concepts of mathematics,\n\n31:00.440 --> 31:02.040\n like maybe multiple dimensions,\n\n31:02.040 --> 31:04.720\n we could sort of talk about that are impossible\n\n31:04.720 --> 31:08.160\n for us to truly intuit, like,\n\n31:08.160 --> 31:13.120\n and it just feels dangerous to me to use these\n\n31:13.120 --> 31:15.720\n as part of our toolbox of abstractions.\n\n31:16.680 --> 31:17.680\n On behalf of your listeners,\n\n31:17.680 --> 31:19.600\n I almost fear we're getting too philosophical.\n\n31:19.600 --> 31:20.440\n Right?\n\n31:20.440 --> 31:21.280\n Heck no.\n\n31:21.280 --> 31:22.120\n Heck no.\n\n31:22.120 --> 31:26.720\n I think to that point for any particular idea like this,\n\n31:26.720 --> 31:28.720\n there's multiple angles of attack.\n\n31:28.720 --> 31:31.920\n I think the, when we do visualize infinity,\n\n31:31.920 --> 31:33.160\n what we're actually doing, you know,\n\n31:33.160 --> 31:34.720\n you write dot, dot, dot, right?\n\n31:34.720 --> 31:37.000\n One, two, three, four, dot, dot, dot, right?\n\n31:37.000 --> 31:37.960\n Those are symbols on the page\n\n31:37.960 --> 31:41.680\n that are insinuating a certain infinity.\n\n31:42.880 --> 31:45.920\n What you're capturing with a little bit of design there\n\n31:45.920 --> 31:49.400\n is the I can always add one more property, right?\n\n31:49.400 --> 31:52.480\n I think I'm just as uncomfortable with you are\n\n31:52.480 --> 31:56.040\n if you try to concretize it so much\n\n31:56.040 --> 31:58.880\n that you have a bag of infinitely many things\n\n31:58.880 --> 32:00.720\n that I actually think of, no, not one, two, three, four,\n\n32:00.720 --> 32:03.360\n dot, dot, dot, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.\n\n32:03.360 --> 32:05.600\n I try to get them all in my head and you realize,\n\n32:05.600 --> 32:08.120\n oh, you know, your brain would literally collapse\n\n32:08.120 --> 32:10.120\n into a black hole, all of that.\n\n32:10.120 --> 32:12.440\n And I honestly feel this with a lot of math\n\n32:12.440 --> 32:15.040\n that I try to read where I don't think of myself\n\n32:15.040 --> 32:19.880\n as like particularly good at math in some ways.\n\n32:19.880 --> 32:21.360\n Like I get very confused often\n\n32:21.360 --> 32:23.720\n when I am going through some of these texts.\n\n32:23.720 --> 32:25.680\n And often what I'm feeling in my head is like,\n\n32:25.680 --> 32:27.840\n this is just so damn abstract.\n\n32:27.840 --> 32:29.160\n I just can't wrap my head around it.\n\n32:29.160 --> 32:31.800\n I just want to put something concrete to it\n\n32:31.800 --> 32:32.920\n that makes me understand.\n\n32:32.920 --> 32:35.560\n And I think a lot of the motivation for the channel\n\n32:35.560 --> 32:38.400\n is channeling that sentiment of, yeah,\n\n32:38.400 --> 32:40.920\n a lot of the things that you're trying to read out there,\n\n32:40.920 --> 32:43.600\n it's just so hard to connect to anything\n\n32:43.600 --> 32:45.280\n that you spend an hour banging your head\n\n32:45.280 --> 32:47.200\n against a couple of pages and you come out\n\n32:47.200 --> 32:49.240\n not really knowing anything more\n\n32:49.240 --> 32:51.760\n other than some definitions maybe\n\n32:51.760 --> 32:55.520\n and a certain sense of self defeat, right?\n\n32:55.520 --> 32:58.480\n One of the reasons I focus so much on visualizations\n\n32:58.480 --> 33:01.720\n is that I'm a big believer in,\n\n33:01.720 --> 33:03.080\n I'm sorry, I'm just really hampering on\n\n33:03.080 --> 33:04.320\n this idea of abstraction,\n\n33:04.320 --> 33:07.400\n being clear about your layers of abstraction, right?\n\n33:07.400 --> 33:09.760\n It's always tempting to start an explanation\n\n33:09.760 --> 33:11.920\n from the top to the bottom, okay?\n\n33:11.920 --> 33:14.080\n You give the definition of a new theorem.\n\n33:14.080 --> 33:16.120\n You're like, this is the definition of a vector space.\n\n33:16.120 --> 33:18.320\n For example, that's how we'll start a course.\n\n33:18.320 --> 33:20.520\n These are the properties of a vector space.\n\n33:20.520 --> 33:23.480\n First from these properties, we will derive what we need\n\n33:23.480 --> 33:25.120\n in order to do the math of linear algebra\n\n33:25.120 --> 33:26.320\n or whatever it might be.\n\n33:26.320 --> 33:28.520\n I don't think that's how understanding works at all.\n\n33:28.520 --> 33:29.880\n I think how understanding works\n\n33:29.880 --> 33:32.440\n is you start at the lowest level you can get at\n\n33:32.440 --> 33:34.600\n where rather than thinking about a vector space,\n\n33:34.600 --> 33:36.240\n you might think of concrete vectors\n\n33:36.240 --> 33:37.880\n that are just lists of numbers\n\n33:37.880 --> 33:41.040\n or picturing it as like an arrow that you draw,\n\n33:41.920 --> 33:44.400\n which is itself like even less abstract than numbers\n\n33:44.400 --> 33:45.440\n because you're looking at quantities,\n\n33:45.440 --> 33:47.000\n like the distance of the x coordinate,\n\n33:47.000 --> 33:48.080\n the distance of the y coordinate.\n\n33:48.080 --> 33:50.120\n It's as concrete as you could possibly get\n\n33:50.120 --> 33:53.640\n and it has to be if you're putting it in a visual, right?\n\n33:53.640 --> 33:56.880\n It's an actual arrow. It's an actual vector.\n\n33:56.880 --> 33:59.120\n You're not talking about like a quote unquote vector\n\n33:59.120 --> 34:01.080\n that could apply to any possible thing.\n\n34:01.080 --> 34:03.480\n You have to choose one if you're illustrating it.\n\n34:03.480 --> 34:05.920\n And I think this is the power of being in a medium\n\n34:05.920 --> 34:08.160\n like video or if you're writing a textbook\n\n34:08.160 --> 34:10.760\n and you force yourself to put a lot of images\n\n34:10.760 --> 34:13.520\n is with every image, you're making a choice.\n\n34:13.520 --> 34:16.240\n With each choice, you're showing a concrete example.\n\n34:16.240 --> 34:17.560\n With each concrete example,\n\n34:17.560 --> 34:19.680\n you're aiding someone's path to understanding.\n\n34:19.680 --> 34:21.360\n I'm sorry to interrupt you,\n\n34:21.360 --> 34:24.600\n but you just made me realize that that's exactly right.\n\n34:24.600 --> 34:26.880\n So the visualizations you're creating\n\n34:26.880 --> 34:29.840\n while you're sometimes talking about abstractions,\n\n34:29.840 --> 34:34.560\n the actual visualization is an explicit low level example.\n\n34:34.560 --> 34:35.400\n Yes.\n\n34:35.400 --> 34:37.400\n So there's an actual, like in the code,\n\n34:37.400 --> 34:40.600\n you have to say what the vector is,\n\n34:40.600 --> 34:42.200\n what's the direction of the arrow,\n\n34:42.200 --> 34:44.960\n what's the magnitude of the, yeah.\n\n34:44.960 --> 34:48.200\n So that's, you're going, the visualization itself\n\n34:48.200 --> 34:50.200\n is actually going to the bottom of that.\n\n34:50.200 --> 34:52.560\n And I think that's very important.\n\n34:52.560 --> 34:54.960\n I also think about this a lot in writing scripts\n\n34:54.960 --> 34:57.360\n where even before you get to the visuals,\n\n34:57.360 --> 35:00.200\n the first instinct is to, I don't know why,\n\n35:00.200 --> 35:02.560\n I just always do, I say the abstract thing,\n\n35:02.560 --> 35:05.040\n I say the general definition, the powerful thing,\n\n35:05.040 --> 35:07.240\n and then I fill it in with examples later.\n\n35:07.240 --> 35:08.680\n Always, it will be more compelling\n\n35:08.680 --> 35:10.720\n and easier to understand when you flip that.\n\n35:10.720 --> 35:13.480\n And instead, you let someone's brain\n\n35:13.480 --> 35:16.240\n do the pattern recognition.\n\n35:16.240 --> 35:18.200\n You just show them a bunch of examples.\n\n35:18.200 --> 35:21.080\n The brain is gonna feel a certain similarity between them.\n\n35:21.080 --> 35:23.560\n Then by the time you bring in the definition,\n\n35:23.560 --> 35:25.720\n or by the time you bring in the formula,\n\n35:25.720 --> 35:28.920\n it's articulating a thing that's already in the brain\n\n35:28.920 --> 35:30.880\n that was built off of looking at a bunch of examples\n\n35:30.880 --> 35:32.840\n with a certain kind of similarity.\n\n35:32.840 --> 35:34.680\n And what the formula does is articulate\n\n35:34.680 --> 35:36.560\n what that kind of similarity is,\n\n35:36.560 --> 35:41.560\n rather than being a high cognitive load set of symbols\n\n35:42.200 --> 35:45.200\n that needs to be populated with examples later on,\n\n35:45.200 --> 35:48.640\n assuming someone's still with you.\n\n35:48.640 --> 35:51.280\n What is the most beautiful or awe inspiring idea\n\n35:51.280 --> 35:53.840\n you've come across in mathematics?\n\n35:53.840 --> 35:55.160\n I don't know, man.\n\n35:55.160 --> 35:57.240\n Maybe it's an idea you've explored in your videos,\n\n35:57.240 --> 35:58.360\n maybe not.\n\n35:58.360 --> 36:01.280\n What just gave you pause?\n\n36:01.280 --> 36:03.360\n What's the most beautiful idea?\n\n36:03.360 --> 36:04.440\n Small or big.\n\n36:04.440 --> 36:07.360\n So I think often, the things that are most beautiful\n\n36:07.360 --> 36:11.800\n are the ones that you have a little bit of understanding of,\n\n36:11.800 --> 36:14.360\n but certainly not an entire understanding.\n\n36:14.360 --> 36:15.560\n It's a little bit of that mystery\n\n36:15.560 --> 36:17.280\n that is what makes it beautiful.\n\n36:17.280 --> 36:20.200\n What was the moment of the discovery for you personally,\n\n36:20.200 --> 36:23.480\n almost just that leap of aha moment?\n\n36:23.480 --> 36:25.240\n So something that really caught my eye,\n\n36:25.240 --> 36:27.920\n I remember when I was little, there were these,\n\n36:29.320 --> 36:31.120\n I think the series was called like wooden books\n\n36:31.120 --> 36:32.400\n or something, these tiny little books\n\n36:32.400 --> 36:34.680\n that would have just a very short description\n\n36:34.680 --> 36:36.920\n of something on the left and then a picture on the right.\n\n36:36.920 --> 36:37.880\n I don't know who they're meant for,\n\n36:37.880 --> 36:39.640\n but maybe it's like loosely children\n\n36:39.640 --> 36:40.520\n or something like that.\n\n36:40.520 --> 36:41.440\n But it can't just be children,\n\n36:41.440 --> 36:43.160\n because of some of the things I was describing.\n\n36:43.160 --> 36:45.280\n On the last page of one of them,\n\n36:45.280 --> 36:47.600\n somewhere tiny in there was this little formula\n\n36:47.600 --> 36:49.880\n that on the left hand had a sum\n\n36:49.880 --> 36:51.840\n over all of the natural numbers.\n\n36:51.840 --> 36:54.760\n It's like one over one to the S plus one over two to the S\n\n36:54.760 --> 36:57.680\n plus one over three to the S on and on to the infinity.\n\n36:57.680 --> 37:01.120\n Then on the other side had a product over all of the primes\n\n37:01.120 --> 37:03.820\n and it was a certain thing had to do with all the primes.\n\n37:03.820 --> 37:06.480\n And like any good young math enthusiast,\n\n37:06.480 --> 37:08.400\n I'd probably been indoctrinated with how chaotic\n\n37:08.400 --> 37:10.920\n and confusing the primes are, which they are.\n\n37:10.920 --> 37:14.280\n And seeing this equation where on one side\n\n37:14.280 --> 37:15.900\n you have something that's as understandable\n\n37:15.900 --> 37:18.280\n as you could possibly get, the counting numbers.\n\n37:18.280 --> 37:20.480\n And on the other side is all the prime numbers.\n\n37:20.480 --> 37:23.960\n It was like this, whoa, they're related like this?\n\n37:23.960 --> 37:26.480\n There's a simple description that includes\n\n37:26.480 --> 37:28.760\n all the primes getting wrapped together like this.\n\n37:28.760 --> 37:32.200\n This is like the Euler product for the Zeta function,\n\n37:32.200 --> 37:33.800\n as I like later found out.\n\n37:33.800 --> 37:36.120\n The equation itself essentially encodes\n\n37:36.120 --> 37:37.900\n the fundamental theorem of arithmetic\n\n37:37.900 --> 37:39.480\n that every number can be expressed\n\n37:39.480 --> 37:42.080\n as a unique set of primes.\n\n37:42.080 --> 37:44.700\n To me still there's, I mean, I certainly don't understand\n\n37:44.700 --> 37:47.280\n this equation or this function all that well.\n\n37:47.280 --> 37:50.280\n The more I learn about it, the prettier it is.\n\n37:50.280 --> 37:53.360\n The idea that you can, this is sort of what gets you\n\n37:53.360 --> 37:57.240\n representations of primes, not in terms of primes themselves,\n\n37:57.240 --> 37:59.160\n but in terms of another set of numbers.\n\n37:59.160 --> 38:01.960\n They're like the non trivial zeros of the Zeta function.\n\n38:01.960 --> 38:04.280\n And again, I'm very kind of in over my head\n\n38:04.280 --> 38:06.660\n in a lot of ways as I like try to get to understand it.\n\n38:06.660 --> 38:09.720\n But the more I do, it always leaves enough mystery\n\n38:09.720 --> 38:11.640\n that it remains very beautiful to me.\n\n38:11.640 --> 38:13.560\n So whenever there's a little bit of mystery\n\n38:13.560 --> 38:16.780\n just outside of the understanding that,\n\n38:16.780 --> 38:19.680\n and by the way, the process of learning more about it,\n\n38:19.680 --> 38:20.580\n how does that come about?\n\n38:20.580 --> 38:23.800\n Just your own thought or are you reading?\n\n38:23.800 --> 38:24.640\n Reading, yeah.\n\n38:24.640 --> 38:26.480\n Or is the process of visualization itself\n\n38:26.480 --> 38:28.160\n revealing more to you?\n\n38:28.160 --> 38:29.000\n Visuals help.\n\n38:29.000 --> 38:31.320\n I mean, in one time when I was just trying to understand\n\n38:31.320 --> 38:33.760\n like analytic continuation and playing around\n\n38:33.760 --> 38:36.240\n with visualizing complex functions,\n\n38:36.240 --> 38:39.500\n this is what led to a video about this function.\n\n38:39.500 --> 38:40.340\n It's titled something like\n\n38:40.340 --> 38:42.360\n Visualizing the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n38:42.360 --> 38:45.040\n It's one that came about because I was programming\n\n38:45.040 --> 38:47.680\n and tried to see what a certain thing looked like.\n\n38:47.680 --> 38:48.520\n And then I looked at it and I'm like,\n\n38:48.520 --> 38:50.640\n whoa, that's elucidating.\n\n38:50.640 --> 38:53.460\n And then I decided to make a video about it.\n\n38:53.460 --> 38:56.680\n But I mean, you try to get your hands on\n\n38:56.680 --> 38:58.120\n as much reading as you can.\n\n38:58.120 --> 39:01.800\n You know, in this case, I think if anyone wants to start\n\n39:01.800 --> 39:05.800\n to understand it, if they have like a math background\n\n39:05.800 --> 39:08.840\n like they studied some in college or something like that,\n\n39:08.840 --> 39:10.280\n like the Princeton Companion to Math\n\n39:10.280 --> 39:13.040\n has a really good article on analytic number theory.\n\n39:13.040 --> 39:15.720\n And that itself has a whole bunch of references\n\n39:15.720 --> 39:17.420\n and you know, anything has more references\n\n39:17.420 --> 39:20.160\n and it gives you this like tree to start piling through.\n\n39:20.160 --> 39:22.160\n And like, you know, you try to understand,\n\n39:22.160 --> 39:24.720\n I try to understand things visually as I go.\n\n39:24.720 --> 39:26.320\n That's not always possible,\n\n39:26.320 --> 39:28.340\n but it's very helpful when it does.\n\n39:28.340 --> 39:30.100\n You recognize when there's common themes,\n\n39:30.100 --> 39:34.460\n like in this case, Cousins of the Fourier Transform\n\n39:34.460 --> 39:35.880\n that come into play and you realize,\n\n39:35.880 --> 39:37.000\n oh, it's probably pretty important\n\n39:37.000 --> 39:39.040\n to have deep intuitions of the Fourier Transform,\n\n39:39.040 --> 39:42.360\n even if it's not explicitly mentioned in like these texts.\n\n39:42.360 --> 39:45.240\n And you try to get a sense of what the common players are.\n\n39:45.240 --> 39:47.220\n But I'll emphasize again, like,\n\n39:47.220 --> 39:50.520\n I feel very in over my head when I try to understand\n\n39:50.520 --> 39:53.520\n the exact relation between like the zeros\n\n39:53.520 --> 39:54.600\n of the Riemann Zeta function\n\n39:54.600 --> 39:56.940\n and how they relate to the distribution of primes.\n\n39:56.940 --> 39:59.360\n I definitely understand it better than I did a year ago.\n\n39:59.360 --> 40:02.360\n I definitely understand it on 100th as well as the experts\n\n40:02.360 --> 40:04.680\n on the matter do, I assume.\n\n40:04.680 --> 40:08.280\n But the slow path towards getting there is,\n\n40:08.280 --> 40:09.600\n it's fun, it's charming,\n\n40:09.600 --> 40:12.900\n and like to your question, very beautiful.\n\n40:12.900 --> 40:14.800\n And the beauty is in the, what,\n\n40:14.800 --> 40:17.080\n in the journey versus the destination?\n\n40:17.080 --> 40:19.420\n Well, it's that each thing doesn't feel arbitrary.\n\n40:19.420 --> 40:20.560\n I think that's a big part,\n\n40:20.560 --> 40:23.360\n is that you have these unpredictable,\n\n40:23.360 --> 40:25.880\n no, yeah, these very unpredictable patterns\n\n40:25.880 --> 40:30.480\n or these intricate properties of like a certain function.\n\n40:30.480 --> 40:31.320\n But at the same time,\n\n40:31.320 --> 40:33.800\n it doesn't feel like humans ever made an arbitrary choice\n\n40:33.800 --> 40:35.760\n in studying this particular thing.\n\n40:35.760 --> 40:38.440\n So, you know, it feels like you're speaking\n\n40:38.440 --> 40:41.280\n to patterns themselves or nature itself.\n\n40:41.280 --> 40:43.160\n That's a big part of it.\n\n40:43.160 --> 40:45.080\n I think things that are too arbitrary,\n\n40:45.080 --> 40:46.640\n it's just hard for those to feel beautiful\n\n40:46.640 --> 40:49.800\n because this is sort of what the word contrived\n\n40:49.800 --> 40:51.680\n is meant to apply to, right?\n\n40:53.420 --> 40:57.640\n And when they're not arbitrary means it could be,\n\n40:57.640 --> 41:02.080\n you can have a clean abstraction and intuition\n\n41:02.940 --> 41:04.940\n that allows you to comprehend it.\n\n41:04.940 --> 41:06.220\n Well, to one of your first questions,\n\n41:06.220 --> 41:07.640\n it makes you feel like if you came across\n\n41:07.640 --> 41:09.680\n another intelligent civilization,\n\n41:09.680 --> 41:12.360\n that they'd be studying the same thing.\n\n41:12.360 --> 41:13.680\n Maybe with different notation.\n\n41:13.680 --> 41:15.520\n Certainly, yeah, but yeah.\n\n41:15.520 --> 41:16.360\n Like that's what,\n\n41:16.360 --> 41:18.740\n I think you talked to that other civilization,\n\n41:18.740 --> 41:20.280\n they're probably also studying the zeros\n\n41:20.280 --> 41:21.680\n of the Riemann Zeta function\n\n41:21.680 --> 41:23.840\n or like some variant thereof\n\n41:23.840 --> 41:27.520\n that is like a clearly equivalent cousin\n\n41:27.520 --> 41:28.560\n or something like that.\n\n41:28.560 --> 41:31.400\n But that's probably on their docket.\n\n41:32.480 --> 41:35.920\n Whenever somebody does a lot of something amazing,\n\n41:35.920 --> 41:37.640\n I'm gonna ask the question\n\n41:37.640 --> 41:40.160\n that you've already been asked a lot\n\n41:40.160 --> 41:43.320\n and that you'll get more and more asked in your life.\n\n41:43.320 --> 41:46.160\n But what was your favorite video to create?\n\n41:46.160 --> 41:49.520\n Oh, favorite to create.\n\n41:49.520 --> 41:51.280\n One of my favorites is,\n\n41:51.280 --> 41:54.220\n the title is Who Cares About Topology?\n\n41:54.220 --> 41:55.920\n You want me to pull it up or no?\n\n41:55.920 --> 41:57.300\n If you want, sure, yeah.\n\n41:57.300 --> 42:00.960\n It is about, well, it starts by describing\n\n42:00.960 --> 42:03.040\n an unsolved problem that's still unsolved in math\n\n42:03.040 --> 42:05.020\n called the inscribed square problem.\n\n42:05.020 --> 42:06.720\n You draw any loop and then you ask,\n\n42:06.720 --> 42:09.180\n are there four points on that loop that make a square?\n\n42:09.180 --> 42:10.320\n Totally useless, right?\n\n42:10.320 --> 42:12.480\n This is not answering any physical questions.\n\n42:12.480 --> 42:14.920\n It's mostly interesting that we can't answer that question.\n\n42:14.920 --> 42:17.320\n And it seems like such a natural thing to ask.\n\n42:18.360 --> 42:21.160\n Now, if you weaken it a little bit and you ask,\n\n42:21.160 --> 42:22.580\n can you always find a rectangle?\n\n42:22.580 --> 42:24.280\n You choose four points on this curve,\n\n42:24.280 --> 42:25.640\n can you find a rectangle?\n\n42:25.640 --> 42:27.520\n That's hard, but it's doable.\n\n42:27.520 --> 42:32.520\n And the path to it involves things like looking at a torus,\n\n42:32.960 --> 42:35.320\n this surface with a single hole in it, like a donut,\n\n42:35.320 --> 42:37.300\n or looking at a mobius strip.\n\n42:37.300 --> 42:39.760\n In ways that feel so much less contrived\n\n42:39.760 --> 42:41.680\n to when I first, as like a little kid,\n\n42:41.680 --> 42:43.400\n learned about these surfaces and shapes,\n\n42:43.400 --> 42:45.460\n like a mobius strip and a torus.\n\n42:45.460 --> 42:47.840\n Like what you learn is, oh, this mobius strip,\n\n42:47.840 --> 42:50.760\n you take a piece of paper, put a twist, glue it together,\n\n42:50.760 --> 42:53.720\n and now you have a shape with one edge and just one side.\n\n42:53.720 --> 42:58.480\n And as a student, you should think, who cares, right?\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:00.600\n Like, how does that help me solve any problems?\n\n43:00.600 --> 43:02.720\n I thought math was about problem solving.\n\n43:02.720 --> 43:05.640\n So what I liked about the piece of math\n\n43:05.640 --> 43:08.500\n that this was describing that was in this paper\n\n43:08.500 --> 43:10.080\n by a mathematician named Vaughn\n\n43:10.080 --> 43:12.960\n was that it arises very naturally.\n\n43:12.960 --> 43:14.360\n It's clear what it represents.\n\n43:14.360 --> 43:15.440\n It's doing something.\n\n43:15.440 --> 43:17.800\n It's not just playing with construction paper.\n\n43:17.800 --> 43:20.920\n And the way that it solves the problem is really beautiful.\n\n43:21.800 --> 43:24.280\n So kind of putting all of that down\n\n43:24.280 --> 43:25.840\n and concretizing it, right?\n\n43:25.840 --> 43:27.680\n Like I was talking about how\n\n43:27.680 --> 43:29.400\n when you have to put visuals to it,\n\n43:29.400 --> 43:30.920\n it demands that what's on screen\n\n43:30.920 --> 43:33.320\n is a very specific example of what you're describing.\n\n43:33.320 --> 43:35.920\n The construction here is very abstract in nature.\n\n43:35.920 --> 43:39.320\n You describe this very abstract kind of surface in 3D space.\n\n43:39.320 --> 43:40.920\n So then when I was finding myself,\n\n43:40.920 --> 43:42.040\n in this case, I wasn't programming,\n\n43:42.040 --> 43:44.560\n I was using a grapher that's like built into OSX\n\n43:44.560 --> 43:48.780\n for the 3D stuff to draw that surface,\n\n43:48.780 --> 43:50.800\n you realize, oh man, the topology argument\n\n43:50.800 --> 43:52.680\n is very non constructive.\n\n43:52.680 --> 43:54.160\n I have to make a lot of,\n\n43:54.160 --> 43:55.680\n you have to do a lot of extra work\n\n43:55.680 --> 43:57.440\n in order to make the surface show up.\n\n43:57.440 --> 43:59.440\n But then once you see it, it's quite pretty\n\n43:59.440 --> 44:02.120\n and it's very satisfying to see a specific instance of it.\n\n44:02.120 --> 44:03.540\n And you also feel like, ah,\n\n44:03.540 --> 44:04.840\n I've actually added something\n\n44:04.840 --> 44:06.720\n on top of what the original paper was doing\n\n44:06.720 --> 44:09.640\n that it shows something that's completely correct.\n\n44:09.640 --> 44:10.880\n That's a very beautiful argument,\n\n44:10.880 --> 44:12.680\n but you don't see what it looks like.\n\n44:12.680 --> 44:14.960\n And I found something satisfying\n\n44:14.960 --> 44:16.400\n in seeing what it looked like\n\n44:16.400 --> 44:17.960\n that could only ever have come about\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:19.240\n from the forcing function\n\n44:19.240 --> 44:21.200\n of getting some kind of image on the screen\n\n44:21.200 --> 44:22.560\n to describe the thing I was talking about.\n\n44:22.560 --> 44:24.260\n So you almost weren't able to anticipate\n\n44:24.260 --> 44:25.100\n what it's gonna look like.\n\n44:25.100 --> 44:26.160\n I had no idea.\n\n44:26.160 --> 44:27.000\n I had no idea.\n\n44:27.000 --> 44:28.280\n And it was wonderful, right?\n\n44:28.280 --> 44:30.360\n It was totally, it looks like a Sydney Opera House\n\n44:30.360 --> 44:32.040\n or some sort of Frank Gehry design.\n\n44:32.040 --> 44:35.200\n And it was, you knew it was gonna be something\n\n44:35.200 --> 44:36.480\n and you can say various things about it.\n\n44:36.480 --> 44:39.320\n Like, oh, it touches the curve itself.\n\n44:39.320 --> 44:42.080\n It has a boundary that's this curve on the 2D plane.\n\n44:42.080 --> 44:43.840\n It all sits above the plane.\n\n44:43.840 --> 44:45.320\n But before you actually draw it,\n\n44:45.320 --> 44:48.160\n it's very unclear what the thing will look like.\n\n44:48.160 --> 44:50.760\n And to see it, it's very, it's just pleasing, right?\n\n44:50.760 --> 44:53.240\n So that was fun to make, very fun to share.\n\n44:53.240 --> 44:58.040\n I hope that it has elucidated for some people out there\n\n44:58.040 --> 45:00.120\n where these constructs of topology come from,\n\n45:00.120 --> 45:03.040\n that it's not arbitrary play with construction paper.\n\n45:04.040 --> 45:07.240\n So let's, I think this is a good sort of example\n\n45:07.240 --> 45:09.640\n to talk a little bit about your process.\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:12.760\n You have a list of ideas.\n\n45:12.760 --> 45:17.480\n So that's sort of the curse of having an active\n\n45:17.480 --> 45:19.600\n and brilliant mind is I'm sure you have a list\n\n45:19.600 --> 45:22.000\n that's growing faster than you can utilize.\n\n45:22.000 --> 45:24.560\n Now I'm ahead, absolutely.\n\n45:24.560 --> 45:26.880\n But there's some sorting procedure\n\n45:26.880 --> 45:29.800\n depending on mood and interest and so on.\n\n45:29.800 --> 45:32.640\n But okay, so you pick an idea\n\n45:32.640 --> 45:36.160\n and then you have to try to write a narrative arc\n\n45:36.160 --> 45:38.800\n that sort of, how do I elucidate?\n\n45:38.800 --> 45:41.320\n How do I make this idea beautiful and clear\n\n45:41.320 --> 45:42.240\n and explain it?\n\n45:42.240 --> 45:44.040\n And then there's a set of visualizations\n\n45:44.040 --> 45:46.160\n that will be attached to it.\n\n45:46.160 --> 45:48.440\n Sort of, you've talked about some of this before,\n\n45:48.440 --> 45:52.920\n but sort of writing the story, attaching the visualizations.\n\n45:52.920 --> 45:56.440\n Can you talk through interesting, painful,\n\n45:56.440 --> 45:58.880\n beautiful parts of that process?\n\n45:58.880 --> 46:02.000\n Well, the most painful is if you've chosen a topic\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:05.680\n that you do want to do, but then it's hard to think of,\n\n46:05.680 --> 46:07.480\n I guess how to structure the script.\n\n46:07.480 --> 46:10.640\n This is sort of where I have been on one\n\n46:10.640 --> 46:12.240\n for like the last two or three months.\n\n46:12.240 --> 46:13.720\n And I think that ultimately the right resolution\n\n46:13.720 --> 46:17.360\n is just like set it aside and instead do some other things\n\n46:17.360 --> 46:18.840\n where the script comes more naturally.\n\n46:18.840 --> 46:23.480\n Because you sort of don't want to overwork a narrative.\n\n46:23.480 --> 46:24.700\n The more you've thought about it,\n\n46:24.700 --> 46:26.480\n the less you can empathize with the student\n\n46:26.480 --> 46:28.940\n who doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach.\n\n46:28.940 --> 46:31.860\n Who is the judger in your head?\n\n46:31.860 --> 46:35.480\n Sort of the person, the creature,\n\n46:35.480 --> 46:38.680\n the essence that's saying this sucks or this is good.\n\n46:38.680 --> 46:42.000\n And you mentioned kind of the student you're thinking about.\n\n46:43.000 --> 46:44.740\n Can you, who is that?\n\n46:44.740 --> 46:45.880\n What is that thing?\n\n46:45.880 --> 46:49.960\n That says, the perfectionist that says this thing sucks.\n\n46:49.960 --> 46:53.520\n You need to work on that for another two, three months.\n\n46:53.520 --> 46:54.360\n I don't know.\n\n46:54.360 --> 46:56.160\n I think it's my past self.\n\n46:56.160 --> 46:58.280\n I think that's the entity that I'm most trying\n\n46:58.280 --> 47:00.880\n to empathize with is like you take who I was,\n\n47:00.880 --> 47:02.480\n because that's kind of the only person I know.\n\n47:02.480 --> 47:03.720\n Like you don't really know anyone\n\n47:03.720 --> 47:05.480\n other than versions of yourself.\n\n47:05.480 --> 47:07.880\n So I start with the version of myself that I know\n\n47:07.880 --> 47:10.320\n who doesn't yet understand the thing, right?\n\n47:10.320 --> 47:15.320\n And then I just try to view it with fresh eyes,\n\n47:15.560 --> 47:17.480\n a particular visual or a particular script.\n\n47:17.480 --> 47:18.840\n Like, is this motivating?\n\n47:18.840 --> 47:20.680\n Does this make sense?\n\n47:20.680 --> 47:21.560\n Which has its downsides,\n\n47:21.560 --> 47:25.200\n because sometimes I find myself speaking to motivations\n\n47:25.200 --> 47:28.520\n that only myself would be interested in.\n\n47:28.520 --> 47:30.840\n I don't know, like I did this project on quaternions\n\n47:30.840 --> 47:33.280\n where what I really wanted was to understand\n\n47:33.280 --> 47:34.920\n what are they doing in four dimensions?\n\n47:34.920 --> 47:37.560\n Can we see what they're doing in four dimensions, right?\n\n47:37.560 --> 47:40.400\n And I came up with a way of thinking about it\n\n47:40.400 --> 47:42.000\n that really answered the question in my head\n\n47:42.000 --> 47:43.280\n that made me very satisfied\n\n47:43.280 --> 47:46.640\n and being able to think about concretely with a 3D visual,\n\n47:46.640 --> 47:48.720\n what are they doing to a 4D sphere?\n\n47:48.720 --> 47:49.560\n And so I'm like, great,\n\n47:49.560 --> 47:51.720\n this is exactly what my past self would have wanted, right?\n\n47:51.720 --> 47:52.760\n And I make a thing on it.\n\n47:52.760 --> 47:55.140\n And I'm sure it's what some other people wanted too.\n\n47:55.140 --> 47:57.400\n But in hindsight, I think most people who wanna learn\n\n47:57.400 --> 48:00.460\n about quaternions are like robotics engineers\n\n48:00.460 --> 48:03.320\n or graphics programmers who want to understand\n\n48:03.320 --> 48:06.160\n how they're used to describe 3D rotations.\n\n48:06.160 --> 48:08.280\n And like their use case was actually a little bit different\n\n48:08.280 --> 48:09.360\n than my past self.\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:10.600\n And in that way, like,\n\n48:10.600 --> 48:12.100\n I wouldn't actually recommend that video\n\n48:12.100 --> 48:14.920\n to people who are coming at it from that angle\n\n48:14.920 --> 48:17.460\n of wanting to know, hey, I'm a robotics programmer.\n\n48:17.460 --> 48:20.260\n Like, how do these quaternion things work\n\n48:20.260 --> 48:22.560\n to describe position in 3D space?\n\n48:22.560 --> 48:25.660\n I would say other great resources for that.\n\n48:25.660 --> 48:27.840\n If you ever find yourself wanting to say like,\n\n48:27.840 --> 48:28.880\n but hang on,\n\n48:28.880 --> 48:30.880\n in what sense are they acting in four dimensions?\n\n48:30.880 --> 48:31.900\n Then come back.\n\n48:31.900 --> 48:34.520\n But until then, that's a little different.\n\n48:34.520 --> 48:35.360\n Yeah, it's interesting\n\n48:35.360 --> 48:38.800\n because you have incredible videos on neural networks,\n\n48:38.800 --> 48:39.840\n for example.\n\n48:39.840 --> 48:41.080\n And from my sort of perspective,\n\n48:41.080 --> 48:43.720\n because I've probably, I mean,\n\n48:43.720 --> 48:44.680\n I looked at the,\n\n48:45.520 --> 48:47.120\n is sort of my field\n\n48:47.120 --> 48:49.320\n and I've also looked at the basic introduction\n\n48:49.320 --> 48:51.100\n of neural networks like a million times\n\n48:51.100 --> 48:52.480\n from different perspectives.\n\n48:52.480 --> 48:53.480\n And it made me realize\n\n48:53.480 --> 48:55.800\n that there's a lot of ways to present it.\n\n48:55.800 --> 48:58.960\n So you were sort of, you did an incredible job.\n\n48:58.960 --> 49:00.140\n I mean, sort of the,\n\n49:01.560 --> 49:03.440\n but you could also do it differently\n\n49:03.440 --> 49:04.900\n and also incredible.\n\n49:04.900 --> 49:09.900\n Like to create a beautiful presentation of a basic concept\n\n49:11.800 --> 49:16.080\n requires sort of creativity, requires genius and so on,\n\n49:16.080 --> 49:18.620\n but you can take it from a bunch of different perspectives.\n\n49:18.620 --> 49:21.440\n And that video on neural networks made me realize that.\n\n49:21.440 --> 49:22.960\n And just as you're saying,\n\n49:22.960 --> 49:26.280\n you kind of have a certain mindset, a certain view,\n\n49:26.280 --> 49:28.980\n but from a, if you take a different view\n\n49:28.980 --> 49:30.680\n from a physics perspective,\n\n49:30.680 --> 49:33.380\n from a neuroscience perspective,\n\n49:33.380 --> 49:34.440\n talking about neural networks\n\n49:34.440 --> 49:38.420\n or from a robotics perspective,\n\n49:38.420 --> 49:40.440\n or from, let's see,\n\n49:40.440 --> 49:43.300\n from a pure learning, statistics perspective.\n\n49:43.300 --> 49:46.360\n So you can create totally different videos.\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:48.240\n And you've done that with a few actually concepts\n\n49:48.240 --> 49:49.920\n where you've have taken different cuts,\n\n49:49.920 --> 49:54.840\n like at the Euler equation, right?\n\n49:54.840 --> 49:56.960\n You've taken different views of that.\n\n49:56.960 --> 49:58.720\n I think I've made three videos on it\n\n49:58.720 --> 50:01.040\n and I definitely will make at least one more.\n\n50:01.040 --> 50:02.040\n Right?\n\n50:02.040 --> 50:03.080\n Never enough.\n\n50:03.080 --> 50:04.120\n Never enough.\n\n50:04.120 --> 50:06.200\n So you don't think it's the most beautiful equation\n\n50:06.200 --> 50:07.240\n in mathematics?\n\n50:08.280 --> 50:10.040\n Like I said, as we represent it,\n\n50:10.040 --> 50:11.440\n it's one of the most hideous.\n\n50:11.440 --> 50:13.320\n It involves a lot of the most hideous aspects\n\n50:13.320 --> 50:14.160\n of our notation.\n\n50:14.160 --> 50:16.960\n I talked about E, the fact that we use pi instead of tau,\n\n50:16.960 --> 50:20.680\n the fact that we call imaginary numbers imaginary,\n\n50:20.680 --> 50:23.420\n and then, hence, I actually wonder if we use the I\n\n50:23.420 --> 50:24.880\n because of imaginary.\n\n50:24.880 --> 50:26.600\n I don't know if that's historically accurate,\n\n50:26.600 --> 50:27.960\n but at least a lot of people,\n\n50:27.960 --> 50:30.300\n they read the I and they think imaginary.\n\n50:30.300 --> 50:31.440\n Like all three of those facts,\n\n50:31.440 --> 50:33.720\n it's like those are things that have added more confusion\n\n50:33.720 --> 50:34.560\n than they needed to,\n\n50:34.560 --> 50:35.840\n and we're wrapping them up in one equation.\n\n50:35.840 --> 50:39.080\n Like boy, that's just very hideous, right?\n\n50:39.080 --> 50:40.880\n The idea is that it does tie together\n\n50:40.880 --> 50:42.160\n when you wash away the notation.\n\n50:42.160 --> 50:44.820\n Like it's okay, it's pretty, it's nice,\n\n50:44.820 --> 50:48.320\n but it's not like mind blowing greatest thing\n\n50:48.320 --> 50:49.520\n in the universe,\n\n50:49.520 --> 50:52.020\n which is maybe what I was thinking of when I said,\n\n50:52.020 --> 50:53.320\n like once you understand something,\n\n50:53.320 --> 50:55.960\n it doesn't have the same beauty.\n\n50:55.960 --> 50:59.000\n Like I feel like I understand Euler's formula,\n\n50:59.000 --> 51:00.840\n and I feel like I understand it enough\n\n51:00.840 --> 51:05.000\n to sort of see the version that just woke up\n\n51:05.000 --> 51:07.560\n that hasn't really gotten itself dressed in the morning\n\n51:07.560 --> 51:08.640\n that's a little bit groggy,\n\n51:08.640 --> 51:10.120\n and there's bags under its eyes.\n\n51:10.120 --> 51:13.320\n So you're past the dating stage,\n\n51:13.320 --> 51:15.040\n you're no longer dating, right?\n\n51:15.040 --> 51:16.760\n I'm still dating the Zeta function,\n\n51:16.760 --> 51:18.920\n and like she's beautiful and right,\n\n51:18.920 --> 51:20.100\n and like we have fun,\n\n51:20.100 --> 51:22.640\n and it's that high dopamine part,\n\n51:22.640 --> 51:24.000\n but like maybe at some point\n\n51:24.000 --> 51:26.840\n we'll settle into the more mundane nature of the relationship\n\n51:26.840 --> 51:28.480\n where I like see her for who she truly is,\n\n51:28.480 --> 51:30.220\n and she'll still be beautiful in her own way,\n\n51:30.220 --> 51:33.720\n but it won't have the same romantic pizzazz, right?\n\n51:33.720 --> 51:35.520\n Well, that's the nice thing about mathematics.\n\n51:35.520 --> 51:38.500\n I think as long as you don't live forever,\n\n51:38.500 --> 51:41.840\n there'll always be enough mystery and fun\n\n51:41.840 --> 51:42.920\n with some of the equations.\n\n51:42.920 --> 51:45.480\n Even if you do, the rate at which questions comes up\n\n51:45.480 --> 51:48.080\n is much faster than the rate at which answers come up, so.\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:49.980\n If you could live forever, would you?\n\n51:51.160 --> 51:52.160\n I think so, yeah.\n\n51:52.160 --> 51:53.760\n So you think, you don't think mortality\n\n51:53.760 --> 51:55.980\n is the thing that makes life meaningful?\n\n51:55.980 --> 51:58.240\n Would your life be four times as meaningful\n\n51:58.240 --> 52:00.440\n if you died at 25?\n\n52:00.440 --> 52:02.200\n So this goes to infinity.\n\n52:02.200 --> 52:04.700\n I think you and I, that's really interesting.\n\n52:04.700 --> 52:09.400\n So what I said is infinite, not four times longer.\n\n52:09.400 --> 52:10.360\n I said infinite.\n\n52:10.360 --> 52:15.200\n So the actual existence of the finiteness,\n\n52:15.200 --> 52:18.020\n the existence of the end, no matter the length,\n\n52:18.020 --> 52:20.680\n is the thing that may sort of,\n\n52:20.680 --> 52:22.380\n from my comprehension of psychology,\n\n52:22.380 --> 52:25.600\n it's such a deeply human,\n\n52:25.600 --> 52:28.560\n it's such a fundamental part of the human condition,\n\n52:28.560 --> 52:31.120\n the fact that there is, that we're mortal,\n\n52:31.120 --> 52:34.480\n that the fact that things end,\n\n52:34.480 --> 52:37.880\n it seems to be a crucial part of what gives them meaning.\n\n52:37.880 --> 52:40.560\n I don't think, at least for me,\n\n52:40.560 --> 52:43.040\n it's a very small percentage of my time\n\n52:43.040 --> 52:45.200\n that mortality is salient,\n\n52:45.200 --> 52:47.200\n that I'm aware of the end of my life.\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:48.360\n What do you mean by me?\n\n52:50.080 --> 52:51.280\n I'm trolling.\n\n52:51.280 --> 52:54.120\n Is it the ego, is it the id, or is it the superego?\n\n52:55.840 --> 52:58.160\n The reflective self, the Wernicke's area\n\n52:58.160 --> 52:59.860\n that puts all this stuff into words.\n\n52:59.860 --> 53:02.520\n Yeah, a small percentage of your mind\n\n53:02.520 --> 53:05.800\n that is actually aware of the true motivations\n\n53:05.800 --> 53:06.960\n that drive you.\n\n53:06.960 --> 53:08.360\n But my point is that most of my life,\n\n53:08.360 --> 53:09.600\n I'm not thinking about death,\n\n53:09.600 --> 53:12.000\n but I still feel very motivated to make things\n\n53:12.000 --> 53:14.000\n and to interact with people,\n\n53:14.000 --> 53:15.400\n experience love or things like that.\n\n53:15.400 --> 53:16.680\n I'm very motivated,\n\n53:16.680 --> 53:19.400\n and it's strange that that motivation comes\n\n53:19.400 --> 53:21.600\n while death is not in my mind at all.\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:23.600\n And this might just be because I'm young enough\n\n53:23.600 --> 53:24.720\n that it's not salient.\n\n53:24.720 --> 53:25.960\n Or it's in your subconscious,\n\n53:25.960 --> 53:28.100\n or that you've constructed an illusion\n\n53:28.100 --> 53:31.180\n that allows you to escape the fact of your mortality\n\n53:31.180 --> 53:32.760\n by enjoying the moment,\n\n53:32.760 --> 53:34.600\n sort of the existential approach to life.\n\n53:34.600 --> 53:36.160\n Could be.\n\n53:36.160 --> 53:38.120\n Gun to my head, I don't think that's it.\n\n53:38.120 --> 53:40.680\n Yeah, another sort of way to say gun to the head\n\n53:40.680 --> 53:43.400\n is sort of the deep psychological introspection\n\n53:43.400 --> 53:44.240\n of what drives us.\n\n53:44.240 --> 53:47.000\n I mean, that's, in some ways to me,\n\n53:47.000 --> 53:49.080\n I mean, when I look at math, when I look at science,\n\n53:49.080 --> 53:51.600\n is a kind of an escape from reality\n\n53:51.600 --> 53:54.400\n in a sense that it's so beautiful.\n\n53:54.400 --> 53:58.740\n It's such a beautiful journey of discovery\n\n53:58.740 --> 54:00.820\n that it allows you to actually,\n\n54:00.820 --> 54:04.760\n it sort of allows you to achieve a kind of immortality\n\n54:04.760 --> 54:09.680\n of explore ideas and sort of connect yourself\n\n54:09.680 --> 54:12.360\n to the thing that is seemingly infinite,\n\n54:12.360 --> 54:13.960\n like the universe, right?\n\n54:13.960 --> 54:18.600\n That allows you to escape the limited nature\n\n54:18.600 --> 54:23.600\n of our little, of our bodies, of our existence.\n\n54:24.040 --> 54:25.960\n What else would give this podcast meaning?\n\n54:25.960 --> 54:26.800\n That's right.\n\n54:26.800 --> 54:28.000\n If not the fact that it will end.\n\n54:28.000 --> 54:30.920\n This place closes in 40 minutes.\n\n54:30.920 --> 54:33.280\n And it's so much more meaningful for it.\n\n54:33.280 --> 54:35.480\n How much more I love this room\n\n54:35.480 --> 54:36.880\n because we'll be kicked out.\n\n54:38.200 --> 54:42.280\n So I understand just because you're trolling me\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:43.600\n doesn't mean I'm wrong.\n\n54:46.200 --> 54:47.840\n But I take your point.\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:49.000\n I take your point.\n\n54:49.000 --> 54:50.960\n Boy, that would be a good Twitter bio.\n\n54:52.120 --> 54:54.320\n Just because you're trolling me doesn't mean I'm wrong.\n\n54:54.320 --> 54:58.560\n Yeah, and sort of difference in backgrounds.\n\n54:58.560 --> 55:01.520\n I'm a bit Russian, so we're a bit melancholic\n\n55:01.520 --> 55:04.320\n and seem to maybe assign a little too much value\n\n55:04.320 --> 55:07.360\n to suffering and mortality and things like that.\n\n55:07.360 --> 55:09.840\n Makes for a better novel, I think.\n\n55:09.840 --> 55:13.400\n Oh yeah, you need some sort of existential threat\n\n55:13.400 --> 55:15.280\n to drive a plot.\n\n55:16.400 --> 55:18.520\n So when do you know when the video is done\n\n55:18.520 --> 55:20.680\n when you're working on it?\n\n55:20.680 --> 55:21.560\n That's pretty easy actually,\n\n55:21.560 --> 55:24.400\n because I'll write the script.\n\n55:24.400 --> 55:27.120\n I want there to be some kind of aha moment in there.\n\n55:27.120 --> 55:28.760\n And then hopefully the script can revolve around\n\n55:28.760 --> 55:30.280\n some kind of aha moment.\n\n55:30.280 --> 55:32.400\n And then from there, you're putting visuals\n\n55:32.400 --> 55:34.040\n to each sentence that exists,\n\n55:34.040 --> 55:36.360\n and then you narrate it, you edit it all together.\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:37.760\n So given that there's a script,\n\n55:37.760 --> 55:39.760\n the end becomes quite clear.\n\n55:40.680 --> 55:44.320\n And as I animate it, I often change\n\n55:45.560 --> 55:46.800\n certainly the specific words,\n\n55:46.800 --> 55:49.320\n but sometimes the structure itself.\n\n55:49.320 --> 55:53.240\n But it's a very deterministic process at that point.\n\n55:53.240 --> 55:54.440\n It makes it much easier to predict\n\n55:54.440 --> 55:55.840\n when something will be done.\n\n55:55.840 --> 55:57.080\n How do you know when a script is done?\n\n55:57.080 --> 55:59.120\n It's like, for problem solving videos,\n\n55:59.120 --> 56:00.400\n that's quite simple.\n\n56:00.400 --> 56:01.440\n It's once you feel like someone\n\n56:01.440 --> 56:03.560\n who didn't understand the solution now could.\n\n56:03.560 --> 56:04.680\n For things like neural networks,\n\n56:04.680 --> 56:06.720\n that was a lot harder because like you said,\n\n56:06.720 --> 56:09.560\n there's so many angles at which you could attack it.\n\n56:09.560 --> 56:11.720\n And there, it's just at some point\n\n56:11.720 --> 56:15.680\n you feel like this asks a meaningful question\n\n56:15.680 --> 56:18.360\n and it answers that question, right?\n\n56:18.360 --> 56:20.280\n What is the best way to learn math\n\n56:20.280 --> 56:22.400\n for people who might be at the beginning of that journey?\n\n56:22.400 --> 56:24.840\n I think that's a question that a lot of folks\n\n56:24.840 --> 56:26.200\n kind of ask and think about.\n\n56:26.200 --> 56:27.800\n And it doesn't, even for folks\n\n56:27.800 --> 56:29.920\n who are not really at the beginning of their journey,\n\n56:29.920 --> 56:33.920\n like there might be actually deep in their career,\n\n56:33.920 --> 56:35.720\n some type they've taken college\n\n56:35.720 --> 56:36.920\n or taken calculus and so on,\n\n56:36.920 --> 56:39.080\n but still wanna sort of explore math.\n\n56:39.080 --> 56:42.880\n What would be your advice instead of education at all ages?\n\n56:42.880 --> 56:45.840\n Your temptation will be to spend more time\n\n56:45.840 --> 56:48.160\n like watching lectures or reading.\n\n56:48.160 --> 56:50.560\n Try to force yourself to do more problems\n\n56:50.560 --> 56:52.160\n than you naturally would.\n\n56:52.160 --> 56:53.800\n That's a big one.\n\n56:53.800 --> 56:56.040\n Like the focus time that you're spending\n\n56:56.040 --> 56:59.000\n should be on like solving specific problems\n\n56:59.000 --> 57:02.360\n and seek entities that have well curated lists of problems.\n\n57:02.360 --> 57:04.240\n So go into like a textbook almost\n\n57:04.240 --> 57:07.160\n and the problems in the back of a textbook kind of thing,\n\n57:07.160 --> 57:08.080\n back of a chapter.\n\n57:08.080 --> 57:10.560\n So if you can take a little look through those questions\n\n57:10.560 --> 57:12.480\n at the end of the chapter before you read the chapter,\n\n57:12.480 --> 57:13.600\n a lot of them won't make sense.\n\n57:13.600 --> 57:14.560\n Some of them might,\n\n57:14.560 --> 57:16.600\n and those are the best ones to think about.\n\n57:16.600 --> 57:18.920\n A lot of them won't, but just take a quick look\n\n57:18.920 --> 57:20.120\n and then read a little bit of the chapter\n\n57:20.120 --> 57:22.400\n and then maybe take a look again and things like that.\n\n57:22.400 --> 57:25.120\n And don't consider yourself done with the chapter\n\n57:25.120 --> 57:28.160\n until you've actually worked through a couple exercises.\n\n57:29.800 --> 57:31.160\n And this is so hypocritical, right?\n\n57:31.160 --> 57:32.400\n Cause I like put out videos\n\n57:32.400 --> 57:35.920\n that pretty much never have associated exercises.\n\n57:35.920 --> 57:38.640\n I just view myself as a different part of the ecosystem,\n\n57:38.640 --> 57:40.760\n which means I'm kind of admitting\n\n57:40.760 --> 57:42.880\n that you're not really learning,\n\n57:42.880 --> 57:44.720\n or at least this is only a partial part\n\n57:44.720 --> 57:47.480\n of the learning process if you're watching these videos.\n\n57:48.600 --> 57:50.360\n I think if someone's at the very beginning,\n\n57:50.360 --> 57:52.200\n like I do think Khan Academy does a good job.\n\n57:52.200 --> 57:54.840\n They have a pretty large set of questions\n\n57:54.840 --> 57:55.840\n you can work through.\n\n57:55.840 --> 57:56.840\n Just the very basics,\n\n57:56.840 --> 57:58.760\n sort of just picking up,\n\n57:58.760 --> 58:01.200\n getting comfortable with the very basic linear algebra,\n\n58:01.200 --> 58:04.040\n calculus or so on, Khan Academy.\n\n58:04.040 --> 58:05.880\n Programming is actually I think a great,\n\n58:05.880 --> 58:08.440\n like learn to program and like let the way\n\n58:08.440 --> 58:11.760\n that math is motivated from that angle push you through.\n\n58:11.760 --> 58:14.280\n I know a lot of people who didn't like math\n\n58:14.280 --> 58:15.520\n got into programming in some way\n\n58:15.520 --> 58:17.240\n and that's what turned them on to math.\n\n58:17.240 --> 58:19.160\n Maybe I'm biased cause like I live in the Bay area,\n\n58:19.160 --> 58:21.000\n so I'm more likely to run into someone\n\n58:21.000 --> 58:23.320\n who has that phenotype.\n\n58:23.320 --> 58:25.760\n But I am willing to speculate\n\n58:25.760 --> 58:28.080\n that that is a more generalizable path.\n\n58:28.080 --> 58:30.080\n So you yourself kind of in creating the videos\n\n58:30.080 --> 58:32.960\n are using programming to illuminate a concept,\n\n58:32.960 --> 58:35.000\n but for yourself as well.\n\n58:35.000 --> 58:37.920\n So would you recommend somebody try to make a,\n\n58:37.920 --> 58:40.240\n sort of almost like try to make videos?\n\n58:40.240 --> 58:41.840\n Like you do as a way to learn?\n\n58:41.840 --> 58:43.120\n So one thing I've heard before,\n\n58:43.120 --> 58:44.680\n I don't know if this is based on any actual study.\n\n58:44.680 --> 58:47.200\n This might be like a total fictional anecdote of numbers,\n\n58:47.200 --> 58:49.720\n but it rings in the mind as being true.\n\n58:49.720 --> 58:51.820\n You remember about 10% of what you read,\n\n58:51.820 --> 58:54.400\n you remember about 20% of what you listen to,\n\n58:54.400 --> 58:57.280\n you remember about 70% of what you actively interact with\n\n58:57.280 --> 59:00.480\n in some way, and then about 90% of what you teach.\n\n59:00.480 --> 59:02.080\n This is a thing I heard again,\n\n59:02.080 --> 59:03.460\n those numbers might be meaningless,\n\n59:03.460 --> 59:05.840\n but they ring true, don't they, right?\n\n59:05.840 --> 59:07.880\n I'm willing to say I learned nine times better\n\n59:07.880 --> 59:09.200\n if I'm teaching something than reading.\n\n59:09.200 --> 59:11.640\n That might even be a low ball, right?\n\n59:11.640 --> 59:12.960\n So doing something to teach\n\n59:12.960 --> 59:15.180\n or to like actively try to explain things\n\n59:15.180 --> 59:17.800\n is huge for consolidating the knowledge.\n\n59:17.800 --> 59:19.640\n Outside of family and friends,\n\n59:19.640 --> 59:22.400\n is there a moment you can remember\n\n59:22.400 --> 59:23.720\n that you would like to relive\n\n59:23.720 --> 59:26.160\n because it made you truly happy\n\n59:26.160 --> 59:30.160\n or it was transformative in some fundamental way?\n\n59:30.160 --> 59:32.680\n A moment that was transformative.\n\n59:32.680 --> 59:35.040\n Or made you truly happy?\n\n59:35.040 --> 59:36.760\n Yeah, I think there's times,\n\n59:36.760 --> 59:38.720\n like music used to be a much bigger part of my life\n\n59:38.720 --> 59:41.600\n than it is now, like when I was a, let's say a teenager,\n\n59:41.600 --> 59:45.400\n and I can think of some times in like playing music.\n\n59:45.400 --> 59:48.160\n There was one, like my brother and a friend of mine,\n\n59:48.160 --> 59:50.160\n so this slightly violates the family and friends,\n\n59:50.160 --> 59:51.800\n but it was the music that made me happy.\n\n59:51.800 --> 59:54.440\n They were just accompanying.\n\n59:54.440 --> 59:57.480\n We like played a gig at a ski resort\n\n59:57.480 --> 59:59.320\n such that you like take a gondola to the top\n\n59:59.320 --> 1:00:00.660\n and like did a thing.\n\n1:00:00.660 --> 1:00:01.820\n And then on the gondola ride down,\n\n1:00:01.820 --> 1:00:04.180\n we decided to just jam a little bit.\n\n1:00:04.180 --> 1:00:06.280\n And it was just like, I don't know,\n\n1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:09.040\n the gondola sort of came over a mountain\n\n1:00:09.040 --> 1:00:10.740\n and you saw the city lights\n\n1:00:10.740 --> 1:00:13.920\n and we're just like jamming, like playing some music.\n\n1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:16.320\n I wouldn't describe that as transformative.\n\n1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:18.040\n I don't know why, but that popped into my mind\n\n1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:21.200\n as a moment of, in a way that wasn't associated\n\n1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:24.200\n with people I love, but more with like a thing I was doing,\n\n1:00:24.200 --> 1:00:26.160\n something that was just, it was just happy\n\n1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.000\n and it was just like a great moment.\n\n1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:32.080\n I don't think I can give you anything deeper than that.\n\n1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:34.840\n Well, as a musician myself, I'd love to see,\n\n1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:38.800\n as you mentioned before, music enter back into your work,\n\n1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:40.080\n back into your creative work.\n\n1:00:40.080 --> 1:00:41.320\n I'd love to see that.\n\n1:00:41.320 --> 1:00:43.880\n I'm certainly allowing it to enter back into mine.\n\n1:00:43.880 --> 1:00:47.840\n And it's a beautiful thing for a mathematician,\n\n1:00:47.840 --> 1:00:51.440\n for a scientist to allow music to enter their work.\n\n1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:53.920\n I think only good things can happen.\n\n1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:57.200\n All right, I'll try to promise you a music video by 2020.\n\n1:00:57.200 --> 1:00:58.040\n By 2020?\n\n1:00:58.040 --> 1:00:58.860\n By the end of 2020.\n\n1:00:58.860 --> 1:00:59.700\n Okay, all right, good.\n\n1:00:59.700 --> 1:01:01.400\n Give myself a longer window.\n\n1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:04.480\n All right, maybe we can like collaborate\n\n1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:05.680\n on a band type situation.\n\n1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:07.020\n What instruments do you play?\n\n1:01:07.020 --> 1:01:08.600\n The main instrument I play is violin,\n\n1:01:08.600 --> 1:01:11.680\n but I also love to dabble around on like guitar and piano.\n\n1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:13.540\n Beautiful, me too, guitar and piano.\n\n1:01:13.540 --> 1:01:18.540\n So in a mathematician's lament, Paul Lockhart writes,\n\n1:01:18.640 --> 1:01:20.080\n the first thing to understand\n\n1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:22.040\n is that mathematics is an art.\n\n1:01:22.040 --> 1:01:24.080\n The difference between math and the other arts,\n\n1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:26.740\n such as music and painting,\n\n1:01:26.740 --> 1:01:29.920\n is that our culture does not recognize it as such.\n\n1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:34.420\n So I think I speak for millions of people, myself included,\n\n1:01:34.420 --> 1:01:37.460\n in saying thank you for revealing to us\n\n1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:39.640\n the art of mathematics.\n\n1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:40.920\n So thank you for everything you do\n\n1:01:40.920 --> 1:01:42.260\n and thanks for talking today.\n\n1:01:42.260 --> 1:01:43.240\n Wow, thanks for saying that.\n\n1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:45.400\n And thanks for having me on.\n\n1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:47.120\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:48.340\n with Grant Sanderson.\n\n1:01:48.340 --> 1:01:51.720\n And thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App.\n\n1:01:51.720 --> 1:01:54.840\n Download it, use code LEXPodcast.\n\n1:01:54.840 --> 1:01:57.720\n You'll get $10 and $10 will go to FIRST,\n\n1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:00.040\n a STEM education nonprofit that inspires\n\n1:02:00.040 --> 1:02:01.960\n hundreds of thousands of young minds\n\n1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:04.960\n to become future leaders and innovators.\n\n1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:07.600\n If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on

now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom\n\n1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:20.280\n from one of Grant's and my favorite people, Richard Feynman.\n\n1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:24.800\n Nobody ever figures out what this life is all about,\n\n1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:26.480\n and it doesn't matter.\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.540\n Explore the world.\n\n1:02:28.540 --> 1:02:30.640\n Nearly everything is really interesting\n\n1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:33.300\n if you go into it deeply enough.\n\n1:02:33.300 --> 1:02:45.300\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
