researcher\n\n00:06.700 --> 00:08.340\n in natural language processing\n\n00:08.340 --> 00:12.460\n and applications of deep learning to chemistry and oncology\n\n00:12.460 --> 00:15.340\n or the use of deep learning for early diagnosis,\n\n00:15.340 --> 00:18.300\n prevention and treatment of cancer.\n\n00:18.300 --> 00:21.020\n She has also been recognized for teaching\n\n00:21.020 --> 00:24.700\n of several successful AI related courses at MIT,\n\n00:24.700 --> 00:26.840\n including the popular Introduction\n\n00:26.840 --> 00:28.920\n to Machine Learning course.\n\n00:28.920 --> 00:32.160\n This is the Artificial Intelligence podcast.\n\n00:32.160 --> 00:34.560\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n00:34.560 --> 00:37.840\n give it five stars on iTunes, support it on

conversation with Regina Barzilay.\n\n00:48.840 --> 00:50.320\n In an interview you've mentioned\n\n00:50.320 --> 00:51.960\n that if there's one course you would take,\n\n00:51.960 --> 00:54.600\n it would be a literature course with a friend of yours\n\n00:54.600 --> 00:56.360\n that a friend of yours teaches.\n\n00:56.360 --> 00:59.160\n Just out of curiosity, because I couldn't find anything\n\n00:59.160 --> 01:04.160\n on it, are there books or ideas that had profound impact\n\n01:04.400 --> 01:07.200\n on your life journey, books and ideas perhaps\n\n01:07.200 --> 01:10.800\n outside of computer science and the technical fields?\n\n01:11.780 --> 01:14.680\n I think because I'm spending a lot of my time at MIT\n\n01:14.680 --> 01:18.280\n and previously in other institutions where I was a student,\n\n01:18.280 --> 01:21.040\n I have limited ability to interact with people.\n\n01:21.040 --> 01:22.640\n So a lot of what I know about the world\n\n01:22.640 --> 01:24.220\n actually comes from books.\n\n01:24.220 --> 01:27.240\n And there were quite a number of books\n\n01:27.240 --> 01:31.380\n that had profound impact on me and how I view the world.\n\n01:31.380 --> 01:35.820\n Let me just give you one example of such a book.\n\n01:35.820 --> 01:39.660\n I've maybe a year ago read a book\n\n01:39.660 --> 01:42.500\n called The Emperor of All Melodies.\n\n01:42.500 --> 01:45.740\n It's a book about, it's kind of a history of science book\n\n01:45.740 --> 01:50.740\n on how the treatments and drugs for cancer were developed.\n\n01:50.740 --> 01:54.580\n And that book, despite the fact that I am in the business\n\n01:54.580 --> 01:59.580\n of science, really opened my eyes on how imprecise\n\n01:59.780 --> 02:03.060\n and imperfect the discovery process is\n\n02:03.060 --> 02:05.820\n and how imperfect our current solutions\n\n02:06.980 --> 02:11.060\n and what makes science succeed and be implemented.\n\n02:11.060 --> 02:14.100\n And sometimes it's actually not the strengths of the idea,\n\n02:14.100 --> 02:17.420\n but devotion of the person who wants to see it implemented.\n\n02:17.420 --> 02:19.780\n So this is one of the books that, you know,\n\n02:19.780 --> 02:22.300\n at least for the last year, quite changed the way\n\n02:22.300 --> 02:24.940\n I'm thinking about scientific process\n\n02:24.940 --> 02:26.700\n just from the historical perspective\n\n02:26.700 --> 02:31.700\n and what do I need to do to make my ideas really implemented.\n\n02:33.460 --> 02:36.060\n Let me give you an example of a book\n\n02:36.060 --> 02:39.580\n which is not kind of, which is a fiction book.\n\n02:40.620 --> 02:43.100\n It's a book called Americana.\n\n02:44.420 --> 02:48.780\n And this is a book about a young female student\n\n02:48.780 --> 02:53.260\n who comes from Africa to study in the United States.\n\n02:53.260 --> 02:57.740\n And it describes her past, you know, within her studies\n\n02:57.740 --> 03:02.020\n and her life transformation that, you know,\n\n03:02.020 --> 03:06.540\n in a new country and kind of adaptation to a new culture.\n\n03:06.540 --> 03:11.220\n And when I read this book, I saw myself\n\n03:11.220 --> 03:13.540\n in many different points of it,\n\n03:13.540 --> 03:18.540\n but it also kind of gave me the lens on different events.\n\n03:20.140 --> 03:22.060\n And some of it that I never actually paid attention.\n\n03:22.060 --> 03:24.700\n One of the funny stories in this book\n\n03:24.700 --> 03:29.700\n is how she arrives to her new college\n\n03:30.420 --> 03:32.900\n and she starts speaking in English\n\n03:32.900 --> 03:35.700\n and she had this beautiful British accent\n\n03:35.700 --> 03:39.860\n because that's how she was educated in her country.\n\n03:39.860 --> 03:40.980\n This is not my case.\n\n03:40.980 --> 03:45.460\n And then she notices that the person who talks to her,\n\n03:45.460 --> 03:47.220\n you know, talks to her in a very funny way,\n\n03:47.220 --> 03:48.340\n in a very slow way.\n\n03:48.340 --> 03:51.460\n And she's thinking that this woman is disabled\n\n03:51.460 --> 03:54.500\n and she's also trying to kind of to accommodate her.\n\n03:54.500 --> 03:56.700\n And then after a while, when she finishes her discussion\n\n03:56.700 --> 03:58.580\n with this officer from her college,\n\n03:59.860 --> 04:02.100\n she sees how she interacts with the other students,\n\n04:02.100 --> 04:03.020\n with American students.\n\n04:03.020 --> 04:08.020\n And she discovers that actually she talked to her this way\n\n04:08.020 --> 04:11.020\n because she saw that she doesn't understand English.\n\n04:11.020 --> 04:14.180\n And I thought, wow, this is a funny experience.\n\n04:14.180 --> 04:16.940\n And literally within few weeks,\n\n04:16.940 --> 04:20.820\n I went to LA to a conference\n\n04:20.820 --> 04:23.180\n and I asked somebody in the airport,\n\n04:23.180 --> 04:25.580\n you know, how to find like a cab or something.\n\n04:25.580 --> 04:28.380\n And then I noticed that this person is talking\n\n04:28.380 --> 04:29.220\n in a very strange way.\n\n04:29.220 --> 04:31.100\n And my first thought was that this person\n\n04:31.100 --> 04:34.500\n have some, you know, pronunciation issues or something.\n\n04:34.500 --> 04:36.060\n And I'm trying to talk very slowly to him\n\n04:36.060 --> 04:38.580\n and I was with another professor, Ernst Frankel.\n\n04:38.580 --> 04:42.180\n And he's like laughing because it's funny\n\n04:42.180 --> 04:44.860\n that I don't get that the guy is talking in this way\n\n04:44.860 --> 04:46.060\n because he thinks that I cannot speak.\n\n04:46.060 --> 04:49.100\n So it was really kind of mirroring experience.\n\n04:49.100 --> 04:53.300\n And it led me think a lot about my own experiences\n\n04:53.300 --> 04:56.060\n moving, you know, from different countries.\n\n04:56.060 --> 04:59.300\n So I think that books play a big role\n\n04:59.300 --> 05:01.780\n in my understanding of the world.\n\n05:01.780 --> 05:06.420\n On the science question, you mentioned that\n\n05:06.420 --> 05:09.780\n it made you discover that personalities of human beings\n\n05:09.780 --> 05:12.420\n are more important than perhaps ideas.\n\n05:12.420 --> 05:13.660\n Is that what I heard?\n\n05:13.660 --> 05:15.740\n It's not necessarily that they are more important\n\n05:15.740 --> 05:19.180\n than ideas, but I think that ideas on their own\n\n05:19.180 --> 05:20.460\n are not sufficient.\n\n05:20.460 --> 05:24.660\n And many times, at least at the local horizon,\n\n05:24.660 --> 05:29.140\n it's the personalities and their devotion to their ideas\n\n05:29.140 --> 05:32.980\n is really that locally changes the landscape.\n\n05:32.980 --> 05:37.500\n Now, if you're looking at AI, like let's say 30 years ago,\n\n05:37.500 --> 05:39.180\n you know, dark ages of AI or whatever,\n\n05:39.180 --> 05:42.420\n what is symbolic times, you can use any word.\n\n05:42.420 --> 05:44.660\n You know, there were some people,\n\n05:44.660 --> 05:46.620\n now we're looking at a lot of that work\n\n05:46.620 --> 05:48.780\n and we're kind of thinking this was not really\n\n05:48.780 --> 05:52.220\n maybe a relevant work, but you can see that some people\n\n05:52.220 --> 05:54.900\n managed to take it and to make it so shiny\n\n05:54.900 --> 05:59.260\n and dominate the academic world\n\n05:59.260 --> 06:02.380\n and make it to be the standard.\n\n06:02.380 --> 06:05.180\n If you look at the area of natural language processing,\n\n06:06.420 --> 06:09.140\n it is well known fact that the reason that statistics\n\n06:09.140 --> 06:13.980\n in NLP took such a long time to become mainstream\n\n06:13.980 --> 06:16.860\n because there were quite a number of personalities\n\n06:16.860 --> 06:18.460\n which didn't believe in this idea\n\n06:18.460 --> 06:22.060\n and didn't stop research progress in this area.\n\n06:22.060 --> 06:25.900\n So I do not think that, you know,\n\n06:25.900 --> 06:28.940\n kind of asymptotically maybe personalities matters,\n\n06:28.940 --> 06:33.940\n but I think locally it does make quite a bit of impact\n\n06:33.940 --> 06:36.900\n and it's generally, you know,\n\n06:36.900 --> 06:41.340\n speeds up the rate of adoption of the new ideas.\n\n06:41.340 --> 06:43.500\n Yeah, and the other interesting question\n\n06:43.500 --> 06:46.540\n is in the early days of particular discipline,\n\n06:46.540 --> 06:50.460\n I think you mentioned in that book\n\n06:50.460 --> 06:52.340\n is ultimately a book of cancer.\n\n06:52.340 --> 06:55.100\n It's called The Emperor of All Melodies.\n\n06:55.100 --> 06:58.580\n Yeah, and those melodies included the trying to,\n\n06:58.580 --> 07:00.740\n the medicine, was it centered around?\n\n07:00.740 --> 07:04.900\n So it was actually centered on, you know,\n\n07:04.900 --> 07:07.180\n how people thought of curing cancer.\n\n07:07.180 --> 07:10.660\n Like for me, it was really a discovery how people,\n\n07:10.660 --> 07:14.140\n what was the science of chemistry behind drug development\n\n07:14.140 --> 07:17.220\n that it actually grew up out of dying,\n\n07:17.220 --> 07:19.780\n like coloring industry that people\n\n07:19.780 --> 07:23.780\n who developed chemistry in 19th century in Germany\n\n07:23.780 --> 07:28.140\n and Britain to do, you know, the really new dyes.\n\n07:28.140 --> 07:30.180\n They looked at the molecules and identified\n\n07:30.180 --> 07:32.140\n that they do certain things to cells.\n\n07:32.140 --> 07:34.500\n And from there, the process started.\n\n07:34.500 --> 07:35.740\n And, you know, like historically saying,\n\n07:35.740 --> 07:36.900\n yeah, this is fascinating\n\n07:36.900 --> 07:38.700\n that they managed to make the connection\n\n07:38.700 --> 07:42.300\n and look under the microscope and do all this discovery.\n\n07:42.300 --> 07:44.340\n But as you continue reading about it\n\n07:44.340 --> 07:48.780\n and you read about how chemotherapy drugs\n\n07:48.780 --> 07:50.500\n which were developed in Boston,\n\n07:50.500 --> 07:52.500\n and some of them were developed.\n\n07:52.500 --> 07:57.500\n And Farber, Dr. Farber from Dana Farber,\n\n07:57.500 --> 08:00.460\n you know, how the experiments were done\n\n08:00.460 --> 08:03.340\n that, you know, there was some miscalculation,\n\n08:03.340 --> 08:04.540\n let's put it this way.\n\n08:04.540 --> 08:06.740\n And they tried it on the patients and they just,\n\n08:06.740 --> 08:09.980\n and those were children with leukemia and they died.\n\n08:09.980 --> 08:11.660\n And then they tried another modification.\n\n08:11.660 --> 08:15.020\n You look at the process, how imperfect is this process?\n\n08:15.020 --> 08:17.500\n And, you know, like, if we're again looking back\n\n08:17.500 --> 08:19.180\n like 60 years ago, 70 years ago,\n\n08:19.180 --> 08:20.780\n you can kind of understand it.\n\n08:20.780 --> 08:23.020\n But some of the stories in this book\n\n08:23.020 --> 08:24.620\n which were really shocking to me\n\n08:24.620 --> 08:27.980\n were really happening, you know, maybe decades ago.\n\n08:27.980 --> 08:30.660\n And we still don't have a vehicle\n\n08:30.660 --> 08:35.100\n to do it much more fast and effective and, you know,\n\n08:35.100 --> 08:38.220\n scientific the way I'm thinking computer science scientific.\n\n08:38.220 --> 08:40.420\n So from the perspective of computer science,\n\n08:40.420 --> 08:43.780\n you've gotten a chance to work the application to cancer\n\n08:43.780 --> 08:44.860\n and to medicine in general.\n\n08:44.860 --> 08:48.420\n From a perspective of an engineer and a computer scientist,\n\n08:48.420 --> 08:51.780\n how far along are we from understanding the human body,\n\n08:51.780 --> 08:55.140\n biology of being able to manipulate it\n\n08:55.140 --> 08:57.940\n in a way we can cure some of the maladies,\n\n08:57.940 --> 08:59.740\n some of the diseases?\n\n08:59.740 --> 09:02.220\n So this is very interesting question.\n\n09:03.460 --> 09:06.020\n And if you're thinking as a computer scientist\n\n09:06.020 --> 09:09.820\n about this problem, I think one of the reasons\n\n09:09.820 --> 09:11.900\n that we succeeded in the areas\n\n09:11.900 --> 09:13.980\n we as a computer scientist succeeded\n\n09:13.980 --> 09:16.260\n is because we don't have,\n\n09:16.260 --> 09:18.980\n we are not trying to understand in some ways.\n\n09:18.980 --> 09:22.260\n Like if you're thinking about like eCommerce, Amazon,\n\n09:22.260 --> 09:24.220\n Amazon doesn't really understand you.\n\n09:24.220 --> 09:27.700\n And that's why it recommends you certain books\n\n09:27.700 --> 09:29.580\n or certain products, correct?\n\n09:30.660 --> 09:34.660\n And, you know, traditionally when people\n\n09:34.660 --> 09:36.380\n were thinking about marketing, you know,\n\n09:36.380 --> 09:39.780\n they divided the population to different kind of subgroups,\n\n09:39.780 --> 09:41.740\n identify the features of this subgroup\n\n09:41.740 --> 09:43.140\n and come up with a strategy\n\n09:43.140 --> 09:45.580\n which is specific to that subgroup.\n\n09:45.580 --> 09:47.340\n If you're looking about recommendation system,\n\n09:47.340 --> 09:50.580\n they're not claiming that they're understanding somebody,\n\n09:50.580 --> 09:52.700\n they're just managing to,\n\n09:52.700 --> 09:54.780\n from the patterns of your behavior\n\n09:54.780 --> 09:57.540\n to recommend you a product.\n\n09:57.540 --> 09:59.580\n Now, if you look at the traditional biology,\n\n09:59.580 --> 10:03.180\n and obviously I wouldn't say that I\n\n10:03.180 --> 10:06.180\n at any way, you know, educated in this field,\n\n10:06.180 --> 10:09.300\n but you know what I see, there's really a lot of emphasis\n\n10:09.300 --> 10:10.660\n on mechanistic understanding.\n\n10:10.660 --> 10:12.540\n And it was very surprising to me\n\n10:12.540 --> 10:13.820\n coming from computer science,\n\n10:13.820 --> 10:17.580\n how much emphasis is on this understanding.\n\n10:17.580 --> 10:20.740\n And given the complexity of the system,\n\n10:20.740 --> 10:23.220\n maybe the deterministic full understanding\n\n10:23.220 --> 10:27.380\n of this process is, you know, beyond our capacity.\n\n10:27.380 --> 10:29.460\n And the same ways in computer science\n\n10:29.460 --> 10:31.540\n when we're doing recognition, when you do recommendation\n\n10:31.540 --> 10:32.780\n and many other areas,\n\n10:32.780 --> 10:35.940\n it's just probabilistic matching process.\n\n10:35.940 --> 10:40.100\n And in some way, maybe in certain cases,\n\n10:40.100 --> 10:42.940\n we shouldn't even attempt to understand\n\n10:42.940 --> 10:45.780\n or we can attempt to understand, but in parallel,\n\n10:45.780 --> 10:48.060\n we can actually do this kind of matchings\n\n10:48.060 --> 10:51.060\n that would help us to find key role\n\n10:51.060 --> 10:54.100\n to do early diagnostics and so on.\n\n10:54.100 --> 10:55.860\n And I know that in these communities,\n\n10:55.860 --> 10:59.060\n it's really important to understand,\n\n10:59.060 --> 11:00.700\n but I'm sometimes wondering, you know,\n\n11:00.700 --> 11:02.940\n what exactly does it mean to understand here?\n\n11:02.940 --> 11:05.500\n Well, there's stuff that works and,\n\n11:05.500 --> 11:07.620\n but that can be, like you said,\n\n11:07.620 --> 11:10.340\n separate from this deep human desire\n\n11:10.340 --> 11:12.700\n to uncover the mysteries of the universe,\n\n11:12.700 --> 11:16.140\n of science, of the way the body works,\n\n11:16.140 --> 11:17.620\n the way the mind works.\n\n11:17.620 --> 11:19.540\n It's the dream of symbolic AI,\n\n11:19.540 --> 11:24.540\n of being able to reduce human knowledge into logic\n\n11:25.220 --> 11:26.900\n and be able to play with that logic\n\n11:26.900 --> 11:28.700\n in a way that's very explainable\n\n11:28.700 --> 11:30.300\n and understandable for us humans.\n\n11:30.300 --> 11:31.780\n I mean, that's a beautiful dream.\n\n11:31.780 --> 11:34.860\n So I understand it, but it seems that\n\n11:34.860 --> 11:37.900\n what seems to work today and we'll talk about it more\n\n11:37.900 --> 11:40.780\n is as much as possible, reduce stuff into data,\n\n11:40.780 --> 11:43.900\n reduce whatever problem you're interested in to data\n\n11:43.900 --> 11:47.060\n and try to apply statistical methods,\n\n11:47.060 --> 11:49.100\n apply machine learning to that.\n\n11:49.100 --> 11:51.140\n On a personal note,\n\n11:51.140 --> 11:54.140\n you were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2014.\n\n11:55.380 --> 11:58.420\n What did facing your mortality make you think about?\n\n11:58.420 --> 12:00.260\n How did it change you?\n\n12:00.260 --> 12:01.860\n You know, this is a great question\n\n12:01.860 --> 12:03.820\n and I think that I was interviewed many times\n\n12:03.820 --> 12:05.740\n and nobody actually asked me this question.\n\n12:05.740 --> 12:09.700\n I think I was 43 at a time.\n\n12:09.700 --> 12:12.860\n And the first time I realized in my life that I may die\n\n12:12.860 --> 12:14.460\n and I never thought about it before.\n\n12:14.460 --> 12:17.260\n And there was a long time since you're diagnosed\n\n12:17.260 --> 12:18.580\n until you actually know what you have\n\n12:18.580 --> 12:20.180\n and how severe is your disease.\n\n12:20.180 --> 12:23.500\n For me, it was like maybe two and a half months.\n\n12:23.500 --> 12:28.340\n And I didn't know where I am during this time\n\n12:28.340 --> 12:30.660\n because I was getting different tests\n\n12:30.660 --> 12:33.380\n and one would say it's bad and I would say, no, it is not.\n\n12:33.380 --> 12:34.900\n So until I knew where I am,\n\n12:34.900 --> 12:36.300\n I really was thinking about\n\n12:36.300 --> 12:38.220\n all these different possible outcomes.\n\n12:38.220 --> 12:39.700\n Were you imagining the worst\n\n12:39.700 --> 12:41.940\n or were you trying to be optimistic or?\n\n12:41.940 --> 12:43.540\n It would be really,\n\n12:43.540 --> 12:47.340\n I don't remember what was my thinking.\n\n12:47.340 --> 12:51.100\n It was really a mixture with many components at the time\n\n12:51.100 --> 12:54.100\n speaking in our terms.\n\n12:54.100 --> 12:59.100\n And one thing that I remember,\n\n12:59.340 --> 13:01.500\n and every test comes and then you're saying,\n\n13:01.500 --> 13:03.300\n oh, it could be this or it may not be this.\n\n13:03.300 --> 13:04.700\n And you're hopeful and then you're desperate.\n\n13:04.700 --> 13:07.660\n So it's like, there is a whole slew of emotions\n\n13:07.660 --> 13:08.700\n that goes through you.\n\n13:09.820 --> 13:14.820\n But what I remember is that when I came back to MIT,\n\n13:15.100 --> 13:17.780\n I was kind of going the whole time through the treatment\n\n13:17.780 --> 13:19.780\n to MIT, but my brain was not really there.\n\n13:19.780 --> 13:21.820\n But when I came back, really finished my treatment\n\n13:21.820 --> 13:23.860\n and I was here teaching and everything,\n\n13:24.900 --> 13:27.060\n I look back at what my group was doing,\n\n13:27.060 --> 13:28.820\n what other groups was doing.\n\n13:28.820 --> 13:30.820\n And I saw these trivialities.\n\n13:30.820 --> 13:33.260\n It's like people are building their careers\n\n13:33.260 --> 13:36.900\n on improving some parts around two or 3% or whatever.\n\n13:36.900 --> 13:38.380\n I was, it's like, seriously,\n\n13:38.380 --> 13:40.740\n I did a work on how to decipher ugaritic,\n\n13:40.740 --> 13:42.860\n like a language that nobody speak and whatever,\n\n13:42.860 --> 13:46.140\n like what is significance?\n\n13:46.140 --> 13:49.020\n When all of a sudden, I walked out of MIT,\n\n13:49.020 --> 13:51.860\n which is when people really do care\n\n13:51.860 --> 13:54.500\n what happened to your ICLR paper,\n\n13:54.500 --> 13:57.900\n what is your next publication to ACL,\n\n13:57.900 --> 14:01.860\n to the world where people, you see a lot of suffering\n\n14:01.860 --> 14:04.900\n that I'm kind of totally shielded on it on daily basis.\n\n14:04.900 --> 14:07.460\n And it's like the first time I've seen like real life\n\n14:07.460 --> 14:08.660\n and real suffering.\n\n14:09.700 --> 14:13.260\n And I was thinking, why are we trying to improve the parser\n\n14:13.260 --> 14:18.260\n or deal with trivialities when we have capacity\n\n14:18.340 --> 14:20.700\n to really make a change?\n\n14:20.700 --> 14:24.620\n And it was really challenging to me because on one hand,\n\n14:24.620 --> 14:27.420\n I have my graduate students really want to do their papers\n\n14:27.420 --> 14:29.860\n and their work, and they want to continue to do\n\n14:29.860 --> 14:31.900\n what they were doing, which was great.\n\n14:31.900 --> 14:36.300\n And then it was me who really kind of reevaluated\n\n14:36.300 --> 14:37.460\n what is the importance.\n\n14:37.460 --> 14:40.260\n And also at that point, because I had to take some break,\n\n14:42.500 --> 14:47.500\n I look back into like my years in science\n\n14:47.740 --> 14:50.460\n and I was thinking, like 10 years ago,\n\n14:50.460 --> 14:52.940\n this was the biggest thing, I don't know, topic models.\n\n14:52.940 --> 14:55.340\n We have like millions of papers on topic models\n\n14:55.340 --> 14:56.500\n and variation of topics models.\n\n14:56.500 --> 14:58.580\n Now it's totally like irrelevant.\n\n14:58.580 --> 15:02.460\n And you start looking at this, what do you perceive\n\n15:02.460 --> 15:04.500\n as important at different point of time\n\n15:04.500 --> 15:08.900\n and how it fades over time.\n\n15:08.900 --> 15:12.980\n And since we have a limited time,\n\n15:12.980 --> 15:14.900\n all of us have limited time on us,\n\n15:14.900 --> 15:18.380\n it's really important to prioritize things\n\n15:18.380 --> 15:20.540\n that really matter to you, maybe matter to you\n\n15:20.540 --> 15:22.020\n at that particular point.\n\n15:22.020 --> 15:24.380\n But it's important to take some time\n\n15:24.380 --> 15:26.940\n and understand what matters to you,\n\n15:26.940 --> 15:28.860\n which may not necessarily be the same\n\n15:28.860 --> 15:31.700\n as what matters to the rest of your scientific community\n\n15:31.700 --> 15:34.580\n and pursue that vision.\n\n15:34.580 --> 15:38.460\n So that moment, did it make you cognizant?\n\n15:38.460 --> 15:42.500\n You mentioned suffering of just the general amount\n\n15:42.500 --> 15:44.340\n of suffering in the world.\n\n15:44.340 --> 15:45.620\n Is that what you're referring to?\n\n15:45.620 --> 15:47.420\n So as opposed to topic models\n\n15:47.420 --> 15:50.780\n and specific detailed problems in NLP,\n\n15:50.780 --> 15:54.460\n did you start to think about other people\n\n15:54.460 --> 15:56.940\n who have been diagnosed with cancer?\n\n15:56.940 --> 16:00.020\n Is that the way you started to see the world perhaps?\n\n16:00.020 --> 16:00.860\n Oh, absolutely.\n\n16:00.860 --> 16:04.980\n And it actually creates, because like, for instance,\n\n16:04.980 --> 16:05.820\n there is parts of the treatment\n\n16:05.820 --> 16:08.500\n where you need to go to the hospital every day\n\n16:08.500 --> 16:11.620\n and you see the community of people that you see\n\n16:11.620 --> 16:16.100\n and many of them are much worse than I was at a time.\n\n16:16.100 --> 16:20.460\n And you all of a sudden see it all.\n\n16:20.460 --> 16:23.940\n And people who are happier someday\n\n16:23.940 --> 16:25.300\n just because they feel better.\n\n16:25.300 --> 16:28.500\n And for people who are in our normal realm,\n\n16:28.500 --> 16:30.820\n you take it totally for granted that you feel well,\n\n16:30.820 --> 16:32.940\n that if you decide to go running, you can go running\n\n16:32.940 --> 16:35.900\n and you're pretty much free\n\n16:35.900 --> 16:37.620\n to do whatever you want with your body.\n\n16:37.620 --> 16:40.180\n Like I saw like a community,\n\n16:40.180 --> 16:42.820\n my community became those people.\n\n16:42.820 --> 16:47.460\n And I remember one of my friends, Dina Katabi,\n\n16:47.460 --> 16:50.420\n took me to Prudential to buy me a gift for my birthday.\n\n16:50.420 --> 16:52.340\n And it was like the first time in months\n\n16:52.340 --> 16:54.980\n that I went to kind of to see other people.\n\n16:54.980 --> 16:58.180\n And I was like, wow, first of all, these people,\n\n16:58.180 --> 16:59.820\n they are happy and they're laughing\n\n16:59.820 --> 17:02.620\n and they're very different from these other my people.\n\n17:02.620 --> 17:04.620\n And second of thing, I think it's totally crazy.\n\n17:04.620 --> 17:06.620\n They're like laughing and wasting their money\n\n17:06.620 --> 17:08.420\n on some stupid gifts.\n\n17:08.420 --> 17:12.540\n And they may die.\n\n17:12.540 --> 17:15.940\n They already may have cancer and they don't understand it.\n\n17:15.940 --> 17:20.060\n So you can really see how the mind changes\n\n17:20.060 --> 17:22.340\n that you can see that,\n\n17:22.340 --> 17:23.180\n before that you can ask,\n\n17:23.180 --> 17:24.380\n didn't you know that you're gonna die?\n\n17:24.380 --> 17:28.340\n Of course I knew, but it was a kind of a theoretical notion.\n\n17:28.340 --> 17:31.060\n It wasn't something which was concrete.\n\n17:31.060 --> 17:33.900\n And at that point, when you really see it\n\n17:33.900 --> 17:38.060\n and see how little means sometimes the system has\n\n17:38.060 --> 17:41.740\n to have them, you really feel that we need to take a lot\n\n17:41.740 --> 17:45.420\n of our brilliance that we have here at MIT\n\n17:45.420 --> 17:48.020\n and translate it into something useful.\n\n17:48.020 --> 17:50.540\n Yeah, and you still couldn't have a lot of definitions,\n\n17:50.540 --> 17:53.620\n but of course, alleviating, suffering, alleviating,\n\n17:53.620 --> 17:57.460\n trying to cure cancer is a beautiful mission.\n\n17:57.460 --> 18:01.940\n So I of course know theoretically the notion of cancer,\n\n18:01.940 --> 18:06.940\n but just reading more and more about it's 1.7 million\n\n18:07.100 --> 18:09.860\n new cancer cases in the United States every year,\n\n18:09.860 --> 18:13.460\n 600,000 cancer related deaths every year.\n\n18:13.460 --> 18:18.460\n So this has a huge impact, United States globally.\n\n18:19.340 --> 18:24.340\n When broadly, before we talk about how machine learning,\n\n18:24.340 --> 18:27.180\n how MIT can help,\n\n18:27.180 --> 18:32.100\n when do you think we as a civilization will cure cancer?\n\n18:32.100 --> 18:34.980\n How hard of a problem is it from everything you've learned\n\n18:34.980 --> 18:35.940\n from it recently?\n\n18:37.260 --> 18:39.300\n I cannot really assess it.\n\n18:39.300 --> 18:42.100\n What I do believe will happen with the advancement\n\n18:42.100 --> 18:45.940\n in machine learning is that a lot of types of cancer\n\n18:45.940 --> 18:48.500\n we will be able to predict way early\n\n18:48.500 --> 18:53.420\n and more effectively utilize existing treatments.\n\n18:53.420 --> 18:57.540\n I think, I hope at least that with all the advancements\n\n18:57.540 --> 19:01.180\n in AI and drug discovery, we would be able\n\n19:01.180 --> 19:04.700\n to much faster find relevant molecules.\n\n19:04.700 --> 19:08.220\n What I'm not sure about is how long it will take\n\n19:08.220 --> 19:11.940\n the medical establishment and regulatory bodies\n\n19:11.940 --> 19:14.780\n to kind of catch up and to implement it.\n\n19:14.780 --> 19:17.420\n And I think this is a very big piece of puzzle\n\n19:17.420 --> 19:20.420\n that is currently not addressed.\n\n19:20.420 --> 19:21.780\n That's the really interesting question.\n\n19:21.780 --> 19:25.460\n So first a small detail that I think the answer is yes,\n\n19:25.460 --> 19:30.460\n but is cancer one of the diseases that when detected earlier\n\n19:33.700 --> 19:37.820\n that's a significantly improves the outcomes?\n\n19:37.820 --> 19:41.020\n So like, cause we will talk about there's the cure\n\n19:41.020 --> 19:43.020\n and then there is detection.\n\n19:43.020 --> 19:45.180\n And I think where machine learning can really help\n\n19:45.180 --> 19:46.660\n is earlier detection.\n\n19:46.660 --> 19:48.580\n So does detection help?\n\n19:48.580 --> 19:49.660\n Detection is crucial.\n\n19:49.660 --> 19:53.940\n For instance, the vast majority of pancreatic cancer patients\n\n19:53.940 --> 19:57.300\n are detected at the stage that they are incurable.\n\n19:57.300 --> 20:02.300\n That's why they have such a terrible survival rate.\n\n20:03.740 --> 20:07.300\n It's like just few percent over five years.\n\n20:07.300 --> 20:09.820\n It's pretty much today the sentence.\n\n20:09.820 --> 20:13.620\n But if you can discover this disease early,\n\n20:14.500 --> 20:16.740\n there are mechanisms to treat it.\n\n20:16.740 --> 20:20.740\n And in fact, I know a number of people who were diagnosed\n\n20:20.740 --> 20:23.580\n and saved just because they had food poisoning.\n\n20:23.580 --> 20:25.020\n They had terrible food poisoning.\n\n20:25.020 --> 20:28.540\n They went to ER, they got scan.\n\n20:28.540 --> 20:30.660\n There were early signs on the scan\n\n20:30.660 --> 20:33.540\n and that would save their lives.\n\n20:33.540 --> 20:35.820\n But this wasn't really an accidental case.\n\n20:35.820 --> 20:40.820\n So as we become better, we would be able to help\n\n20:41.260 --> 20:46.260\n to many more people that are likely to develop diseases.\n\n20:46.540 --> 20:51.020\n And I just want to say that as I got more into this field,\n\n20:51.020 --> 20:53.620\n I realized that cancer is of course terrible disease,\n\n20:53.620 --> 20:56.700\n but there are really the whole slew of terrible diseases\n\n20:56.700 --> 21:00.820\n out there like neurodegenerative diseases and others.\n\n21:01.660 --> 21:04.580\n So we, of course, a lot of us are fixated on cancer\n\n21:04.580 --> 21:06.420\n because it's so prevalent in our society.\n\n21:06.420 --> 21:08.540\n And you see these people where there are a lot of patients\n\n21:08.540 --> 21:10.340\n with neurodegenerative diseases\n\n21:10.340 --> 21:12.540\n and the kind of aging diseases\n\n21:12.540 --> 21:17.100\n that we still don't have a good solution for.\n\n21:17.100 --> 21:22.100\n And I felt as a computer scientist,\n\n21:22.860 --> 21:25.460\n we kind of decided that it's other people's job\n\n21:25.460 --> 21:29.340\n to treat these diseases because it's like traditionally\n\n21:29.340 --> 21:32.420\n people in biology or in chemistry or MDs\n\n21:32.420 --> 21:35.340\n are the ones who are thinking about it.\n\n21:35.340 --> 21:37.420\n And after kind of start paying attention,\n\n21:37.420 --> 21:40.340\n I think that it's really a wrong assumption\n\n21:40.340 --> 21:42.940\n and we all need to join the battle.\n\n21:42.940 --> 21:46.460\n So how it seems like in cancer specifically\n\n21:46.460 --> 21:49.140\n that there's a lot of ways that machine learning can help.\n\n21:49.140 --> 21:51.860\n So what's the role of machine learning\n\n21:51.860 --> 21:54.100\n in the diagnosis of cancer?\n\n21:55.260 --> 21:58.700\n So for many cancers today, we really don't know\n\n21:58.700 --> 22:03.460\n what is your likelihood to get cancer.\n\n22:03.460 --> 22:06.300\n And for the vast majority of patients,\n\n22:06.300 --> 22:07.940\n especially on the younger patients,\n\n22:07.940 --> 22:09.580\n it really comes as a surprise.\n\n22:09.580 --> 22:11.140\n Like for instance, for breast cancer,\n\n22:11.140 --> 22:13.860\n 80% of the patients are first in their families,\n\n22:13.860 --> 22:15.380\n it's like me.\n\n22:15.380 --> 22:18.460\n And I never saw that I had any increased risk\n\n22:18.460 --> 22:20.820\n because nobody had it in my family.\n\n22:20.820 --> 22:22.300\n And for some reason in my head,\n\n22:22.300 --> 22:24.820\n it was kind of inherited disease.\n\n22:26.580 --> 22:28.380\n But even if I would pay attention,\n\n22:28.380 --> 22:32.420\n the very simplistic statistical models\n\n22:32.420 --> 22:34.540\n that are currently used in clinical practice,\n\n22:34.540 --> 22:37.460\n they really don't give you an answer, so you don't know.\n\n22:37.460 --> 22:40.380\n And the same true for pancreatic cancer,\n\n22:40.380 --> 22:45.380\n the same true for non smoking lung cancer and many others.\n\n22:45.380 --> 22:47.340\n So what machine learning can do here\n\n22:47.340 --> 22:51.620\n is utilize all this data to tell us early\n\n22:51.620 --> 22:53.140\n who is likely to be susceptible\n\n22:53.140 --> 22:55.980\n and using all the information that is already there,\n\n22:55.980 --> 22:59.980\n be it imaging, be it your other tests,\n\n22:59.980 --> 23:04.860\n and eventually liquid biopsies and others,\n\n23:04.860 --> 23:08.180\n where the signal itself is not sufficiently strong\n\n23:08.180 --> 23:11.300\n for human eye to do good discrimination\n\n23:11.300 --> 23:12.940\n because the signal may be weak,\n\n23:12.940 --> 23:15.620\n but by combining many sources,\n\n23:15.620 --> 23:18.100\n machine which is trained on large volumes of data\n\n23:18.100 --> 23:20.700\n can really detect it early.\n\n23:20.700 --> 23:22.500\n And that's what we've seen with breast cancer\n\n23:22.500 --> 23:25.900\n and people are reporting it in other diseases as well.\n\n23:25.900 --> 23:28.260\n That really boils down to data, right?\n\n23:28.260 --> 23:30.980\n And in the different kinds of sources of data.\n\n23:30.980 --> 23:33.740\n And you mentioned regulatory challenges.\n\n23:33.740 --> 23:35.180\n So what are the challenges\n\n23:35.180 --> 23:39.260\n in gathering large data sets in this space?\n\n23:40.860 --> 23:42.660\n Again, another great question.\n\n23:42.660 --> 23:45.500\n So it took me after I decided that I want to work on it\n\n23:45.500 --> 23:48.740\n two years to get access to data.\n\n23:48.740 --> 23:50.580\n Any data, like any significant data set?\n\n23:50.580 --> 23:53.580\n Any significant amount, like right now in this country,\n\n23:53.580 --> 23:57.060\n there is no publicly available data set\n\n23:57.060 --> 23:58.820\n of modern mammograms that you can just go\n\n23:58.820 --> 24:01.860\n on your computer, sign a document and get it.\n\n24:01.860 --> 24:03.180\n It just doesn't exist.\n\n24:03.180 --> 24:06.860\n I mean, obviously every hospital has its own collection\n\n24:06.860 --> 24:07.700\n of mammograms.\n\n24:07.700 --> 24:11.300\n There are data that came out of clinical trials.\n\n24:11.300 --> 24:13.220\n What we're talking about here is a computer scientist\n\n24:13.220 --> 24:17.140\n who just wants to run his or her model\n\n24:17.140 --> 24:19.060\n and see how it works.\n\n24:19.060 --> 24:22.900\n This data, like ImageNet, doesn't exist.\n\n24:22.900 --> 24:27.900\n And there is a set which is called like Florida data set\n\n24:28.620 --> 24:30.860\n which is a film mammogram from 90s\n\n24:30.860 --> 24:32.420\n which is totally not representative\n\n24:32.420 --> 24:33.860\n of the current developments.\n\n24:33.860 --> 24:35.780\n Whatever you're learning on them doesn't scale up.\n\n24:35.780 --> 24:39.300\n This is the only resource that is available.\n\n24:39.300 --> 24:42.780\n And today there are many agencies\n\n24:42.780 --> 24:44.460\n that govern access to data.\n\n24:44.460 --> 24:46.300\n Like the hospital holds your data\n\n24:46.300 --> 24:49.260\n and the hospital decides whether they would give it\n\n24:49.260 --> 24:52.340\n to the researcher to work with this data or not.\n\n24:52.340 --> 24:54.180\n Individual hospital?\n\n24:54.180 --> 24:55.020\n Yeah.\n\n24:55.020 --> 24:57.220\n I mean, the hospital may, you know,\n\n24:57.220 --> 24:59.220\n assuming that you're doing research collaboration,\n\n24:59.220 --> 25:01.980\n you can submit, you know,\n\n25:01.980 --> 25:05.060\n there is a proper approval process guided by RB\n\n25:05.060 --> 25:07.820\n and if you go through all the processes,\n\n25:07.820 --> 25:10.140\n you can eventually get access to the data.\n\n25:10.140 --> 25:13.540\n But if you yourself know our OEI community,\n\n25:13.540 --> 25:16.100\n there are not that many people who actually ever got access\n\n25:16.100 --> 25:20.260\n to data because it's very challenging process.\n\n25:20.260 --> 25:22.780\n And sorry, just in a quick comment,\n\n25:22.780 --> 25:25.780\n MGH or any kind of hospital,\n\n25:25.780 --> 25:28.100\n are they scanning the data?\n\n25:28.100 --> 25:29.740\n Are they digitally storing it?\n\n25:29.740 --> 25:31.580\n Oh, it is already digitally stored.\n\n25:31.580 --> 25:34.180\n You don't need to do any extra processing steps.\n\n25:34.180 --> 25:38.340\n It's already there in the right format is that right now\n\n25:38.340 --> 25:41.180\n there are a lot of issues that govern access to the data\n\n25:41.180 --> 25:46.180\n because the hospital is legally responsible for the data.\n\n25:46.180 --> 25:51.020\n And, you know, they have a lot to lose\n\n25:51.020 --> 25:53.140\n if they give the data to the wrong person,\n\n25:53.140 --> 25:56.460\n but they may not have a lot to gain if they give it\n\n25:56.460 --> 26:00.580\n as a hospital, as a legal entity has given it to you.\n\n26:00.580 --> 26:02.740\n And the way, you know, what I would imagine\n\n26:02.740 --> 26:05.220\n happening in the future is the same thing that happens\n\n26:05.220 --> 26:06.780\n when you're getting your driving license,\n\n26:06.780 --> 26:09.820\n you can decide whether you want to donate your organs.\n\n26:09.820 --> 26:13.100\n You can imagine that whenever a person goes to the hospital,\n\n26:13.100 --> 26:17.540\n they, it should be easy for them to donate their data\n\n26:17.540 --> 26:19.420\n for research and it can be different kind of,\n\n26:19.420 --> 26:22.420\n do they only give you a test results or only mammogram\n\n26:22.420 --> 26:25.900\n or only imaging data or the whole medical record?\n\n26:27.060 --> 26:28.980\n Because at the end,\n\n26:30.540 --> 26:33.860\n we all will benefit from all this insights.\n\n26:33.860 --> 26:36.060\n And it's not like you say, I want to keep my data private,\n\n26:36.060 --> 26:38.780\n but I would really love to get it from other people\n\n26:38.780 --> 26:40.740\n because other people are thinking the same way.\n\n26:40.740 --> 26:45.740\n So if there is a mechanism to do this donation\n\n26:45.740 --> 26:48.020\n and the patient has an ability to say\n\n26:48.020 --> 26:50.820\n how they want to use their data for research,\n\n26:50.820 --> 26:54.100\n it would be really a game changer.\n\n26:54.100 --> 26:56.460\n People, when they think about this problem,\n\n26:56.460 --> 26:58.460\n there's a, it depends on the population,\n\n26:58.460 --> 27:00.140\n depends on the demographics,\n\n27:00.140 --> 27:03.420\n but there's some privacy concerns generally,\n\n27:03.420 --> 27:05.860\n not just medical data, just any kind of data.\n\n27:05.860 --> 27:09.620\n It's what you said, my data, it should belong kind of to me.\n\n27:09.620 --> 27:11.660\n I'm worried how it's going to be misused.\n\n27:12.540 --> 27:15.620\n How do we alleviate those concerns?\n\n27:17.100 --> 27:19.460\n Because that seems like a problem that needs to be,\n\n27:19.460 --> 27:22.980\n that problem of trust, of transparency needs to be solved\n\n27:22.980 --> 27:27.260\n before we build large data sets that help detect cancer,\n\n27:27.260 --> 27:30.180\n help save those very people in the future.\n\n27:30.180 --> 27:31.940\n So I think there are two things that could be done.\n\n27:31.940 --> 27:34.460\n There is a technical solutions\n\n27:34.460 --> 27:38.220\n and there are societal solutions.\n\n27:38.220 --> 27:40.180\n So on the technical end,\n\n27:41.460 --> 27:46.460\n we today have ability to improve disambiguation.\n\n27:48.140 --> 27:49.740\n Like, for instance, for imaging,\n\n27:49.740 --> 27:54.740\n it's, you know, for imaging, you can do it pretty well.\n\n27:55.620 --> 27:56.780\n What's disambiguation?\n\n27:56.780 --> 27:58.540\n And disambiguation, sorry, disambiguation,\n\n27:58.540 --> 27:59.860\n removing the identification,\n\n27:59.860 --> 28:02.220\n removing the names of the people.\n\n28:02.220 --> 28:04.820\n There are other data, like if it is a raw tax,\n\n28:04.820 --> 28:08.180\n you cannot really achieve 99.9%,\n\n28:08.180 --> 28:10.060\n but there are all these techniques\n\n28:10.060 --> 28:12.460\n that actually some of them are developed at MIT,\n\n28:12.460 --> 28:15.460\n how you can do learning on the encoded data\n\n28:15.460 --> 28:17.420\n where you locally encode the image,\n\n28:17.420 --> 28:22.420\n you train a network which only works on the encoded images\n\n28:22.420 --> 28:24.940\n and then you send the outcome back to the hospital\n\n28:24.940 --> 28:26.580\n and you can open it up.\n\n28:26.580 --> 28:28.020\n So those are the technical solutions.\n\n28:28.020 --> 28:30.660\n There are a lot of people who are working in this space\n\n28:30.660 --> 28:33.780\n where the learning happens in the encoded form.\n\n28:33.780 --> 28:36.180\n We are still early,\n\n28:36.180 --> 28:39.260\n but this is an interesting research area\n\n28:39.260 --> 28:41.900\n where I think we'll make more progress.\n\n28:43.340 --> 28:45.620\n There is a lot of work in natural language processing\n\n28:45.620 --> 28:48.620\n community how to do the identification better.\n\n28:50.380 --> 28:54.020\n But even today, there are already a lot of data\n\n28:54.020 --> 28:55.900\n which can be deidentified perfectly,\n\n28:55.900 --> 28:58.780\n like your test data, for instance, correct,\n\n28:58.780 --> 29:00.980\n where you can just, you know the name of the patient,\n\n29:00.980 --> 29:04.300\n you just want to extract the part with the numbers.\n\n29:04.300 --> 29:07.460\n The big problem here is again,\n\n29:08.420 --> 29:10.420\n hospitals don't see much incentive\n\n29:10.420 --> 29:12.660\n to give this data away on one hand\n\n29:12.660 --> 29:14.220\n and then there is general concern.\n\n29:14.220 --> 29:17.700\n Now, when I'm talking about societal benefits\n\n29:17.700 --> 29:19.660\n and about the education,\n\n29:19.660 --> 29:24.340\n the public needs to understand that I think\n\n29:25.700 --> 29:29.420\n that there are situation and I still remember myself\n\n29:29.420 --> 29:33.380\n when I really needed an answer, I had to make a choice.\n\n29:33.380 --> 29:35.220\n There was no information to make a choice,\n\n29:35.220 --> 29:36.660\n you're just guessing.\n\n29:36.660 --> 29:41.060\n And at that moment you feel that your life is at the stake,\n\n29:41.060 --> 29:44.820\n but you just don't have information to make the choice.\n\n29:44.820 --> 29:48.740\n And many times when I give talks,\n\n29:48.740 --> 29:51.300\n I get emails from women who say,\n\n29:51.300 --> 29:52.820\n you know, I'm in this situation,\n\n29:52.820 --> 29:55.940\n can you please run statistic and see what are the outcomes?\n\n29:57.100 --> 30:01.300\n We get almost every week a mammogram that comes by mail\n\n30:01.300 --> 30:03.460\n to my office at MIT, I'm serious.\n\n30:04.380 --> 30:07.860\n That people ask to run because they need to make\n\n30:07.860 --> 30:10.020\n life changing decisions.\n\n30:10.020 --> 30:12.980\n And of course, I'm not planning to open a clinic here,\n\n30:12.980 --> 30:16.660\n but we do run and give them the results for their doctors.\n\n30:16.660 --> 30:20.100\n But the point that I'm trying to make,\n\n30:20.100 --> 30:23.780\n that we all at some point or our loved ones\n\n30:23.780 --> 30:26.620\n will be in the situation where you need information\n\n30:26.620 --> 30:28.860\n to make the best choice.\n\n30:28.860 --> 30:31.860\n And if this information is not available,\n\n30:31.860 --> 30:35.100\n you would feel vulnerable and unprotected.\n\n30:35.100 --> 30:37.860\n And then the question is, you know, what do I care more?\n\n30:37.860 --> 30:40.380\n Because at the end, everything is a trade off, correct?\n\n30:40.380 --> 30:41.700\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n30:41.700 --> 30:45.580\n Just out of curiosity, it seems like one possible solution,\n\n30:45.580 --> 30:47.420\n I'd like to see what you think of it,\n\n30:49.340 --> 30:50.660\n based on what you just said,\n\n30:50.660 --> 30:52.500\n based on wanting to know answers\n\n30:52.500 --> 30:55.060\n for when you're yourself in that situation.\n\n30:55.060 --> 30:58.420\n Is it possible for patients to own their data\n\n30:58.420 --> 31:01.020\n as opposed to hospitals owning their data?\n\n31:01.020 --> 31:04.100\n Of course, theoretically, I guess patients own their data,\n\n31:04.100 --> 31:06.620\n but can you walk out there with a USB stick\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:10.620\n containing everything or upload it to the cloud?\n\n31:10.620 --> 31:14.500\n Where a company, you know, I remember Microsoft\n\n31:14.500 --> 31:17.820\n had a service, like I try, I was really excited about\n\n31:17.820 --> 31:19.260\n and Google Health was there.\n\n31:19.260 --> 31:21.900\n I tried to give, I was excited about it.\n\n31:21.900 --> 31:24.780\n Basically companies helping you upload your data\n\n31:24.780 --> 31:27.940\n to the cloud so that you can move from hospital to hospital\n\n31:27.940 --> 31:29.260\n from doctor to doctor.\n\n31:29.260 --> 31:32.700\n Do you see a promise of that kind of possibility?\n\n31:32.700 --> 31:34.660\n I absolutely think this is, you know,\n\n31:34.660 --> 31:38.180\n the right way to exchange the data.\n\n31:38.180 --> 31:41.700\n I don't know now who's the biggest player in this field,\n\n31:41.700 --> 31:45.940\n but I can clearly see that even for totally selfish\n\n31:45.940 --> 31:49.300\n health reasons, when you are going to a new facility\n\n31:49.300 --> 31:52.620\n and many of us are sent to some specialized treatment,\n\n31:52.620 --> 31:55.740\n they don't easily have access to your data.\n\n31:55.740 --> 31:59.420\n And today, you know, we might want to send this mammogram,\n\n31:59.420 --> 32:01.780\n need to go to the hospital, find some small office\n\n32:01.780 --> 32:04.820\n which gives them the CD and they ship as a CD.\n\n32:04.820 --> 32:08.340\n So you can imagine we're looking at kind of decades old\n\n32:08.340 --> 32:10.100\n mechanism of data exchange.\n\n32:11.340 --> 32:15.620\n So I definitely think this is an area where hopefully\n\n32:15.620 --> 32:20.380\n all the right regulatory and technical forces will align\n\n32:20.380 --> 32:23.220\n and we will see it actually implemented.\n\n32:23.220 --> 32:27.500\n It's sad because unfortunately, and I need to research\n\n32:27.500 --> 32:30.620\n why that happened, but I'm pretty sure Google Health\n\n32:30.620 --> 32:32.940\n and Microsoft Health Vault or whatever it's called\n\n32:32.940 --> 32:36.100\n both closed down, which means that there was\n\n32:36.100 --> 32:39.100\n either regulatory pressure or there's not a business case\n\n32:39.100 --> 32:41.820\n or there's challenges from hospitals,\n\n32:41.820 --> 32:43.260\n which is very disappointing.\n\n32:43.260 --> 32:46.500\n So when you say you don't know what the biggest players are,\n\n32:46.500 --> 32:50.540\n the two biggest that I was aware of closed their doors.\n\n32:50.540 --> 32:53.140\n So I'm hoping, I'd love to see why\n\n32:53.140 --> 32:54.780\n and I'd love to see who else can come up.\n\n32:54.780 --> 32:59.620\n It seems like one of those Elon Musk style problems\n\n32:59.620 --> 33:01.300\n that are obvious needs to be solved\n\n33:01.300 --> 33:02.980\n and somebody needs to step up and actually do\n\n33:02.980 --> 33:07.540\n this large scale data collection.\n\n33:07.540 --> 33:09.620\n So I know there is an initiative in Massachusetts,\n\n33:09.620 --> 33:11.740\n I think, which you led by the governor\n\n33:11.740 --> 33:15.460\n to try to create this kind of health exchange system\n\n33:15.460 --> 33:17.860\n where at least to help people who kind of when you show up\n\n33:17.860 --> 33:20.220\n in emergency room and there is no information\n\n33:20.220 --> 33:23.540\n about what are your allergies and other things.\n\n33:23.540 --> 33:26.140\n So I don't know how far it will go.\n\n33:26.140 --> 33:28.180\n But another thing that you said\n\n33:28.180 --> 33:30.780\n and I find it very interesting is actually\n\n33:30.780 --> 33:33.780\n who are the successful players in this space\n\n33:33.780 --> 33:37.260\n and the whole implementation, how does it go?\n\n33:37.260 --> 33:40.300\n To me, it is from the anthropological perspective,\n\n33:40.300 --> 33:44.660\n it's more fascinating that AI that today goes in healthcare,\n\n33:44.660 --> 33:50.380\n we've seen so many attempts and so very little successes.\n\n33:50.380 --> 33:54.220\n And it's interesting to understand that I've by no means\n\n33:54.220 --> 33:56.700\n have knowledge to assess it,\n\n33:56.700 --> 33:59.620\n why we are in the position where we are.\n\n33:59.620 --> 34:02.940\n Yeah, it's interesting because data is really fuel\n\n34:02.940 --> 34:04.980\n for a lot of successful applications.\n\n34:04.980 --> 34:08.500\n And when that data acquires regulatory approval,\n\n34:08.500 --> 34:12.940\n like the FDA or any kind of approval,\n\n34:12.940 --> 34:15.740\n it seems that the computer scientists\n\n34:15.740 --> 34:17.460\n are not quite there yet in being able\n\n34:17.460 --> 34:18.900\n to play the regulatory game,\n\n34:18.900 --> 34:21.220\n understanding the fundamentals of it.\n\n34:21.220 --> 34:26.500\n I think that in many cases when even people do have data,\n\n34:26.500 --> 34:31.300\n we still don't know what exactly do you need to demonstrate\n\n34:31.300 --> 34:33.860\n to change the standard of care.\n\n34:35.500 --> 34:37.180\n Like let me give you an example\n\n34:37.180 --> 34:41.100\n related to my breast cancer research.\n\n34:41.100 --> 34:45.500\n So in traditional breast cancer risk assessment,\n\n34:45.500 --> 34:47.140\n there is something called density,\n\n34:47.140 --> 34:50.500\n which determines the likelihood of a woman to get cancer.\n\n34:50.500 --> 34:51.700\n And this pretty much says,\n\n34:51.700 --> 34:54.220\n how much white do you see on the mammogram?\n\n34:54.220 --> 34:58.980\n The whiter it is, the more likely the tissue is dense.\n\n34:58.980 --> 35:03.660\n And the idea behind density, it's not a bad idea.\n\n35:03.660 --> 35:08.100\n In 1967, a radiologist called Wolf decided to look back\n\n35:08.100 --> 35:09.780\n at women who were diagnosed\n\n35:09.780 --> 35:12.420\n and see what is special in their images.\n\n35:12.420 --> 35:14.700\n Can we look back and say that they're likely to develop?\n\n35:14.700 --> 35:16.180\n So he come up with some patterns.\n\n35:16.180 --> 35:20.660\n And it was the best that his human eye can identify.\n\n35:20.660 --> 35:22.060\n Then it was kind of formalized\n\n35:22.060 --> 35:24.220\n and coded into four categories.\n\n35:24.220 --> 35:26.940\n And that's what we are using today.\n\n35:26.940 --> 35:31.020\n And today this density assessment\n\n35:31.020 --> 35:34.620\n is actually a federal law from 2019,\n\n35:34.620 --> 35:36.180\n approved by President Trump\n\n35:36.180 --> 35:40.100\n and for the previous FDA commissioner,\n\n35:40.100 --> 35:43.620\n where women are supposed to be advised by their providers\n\n35:43.620 --> 35:45.100\n if they have high density,\n\n35:45.100 --> 35:47.260\n putting them into higher risk category.\n\n35:47.260 --> 35:49.460\n And in some states,\n\n35:49.460 --> 35:51.260\n you can actually get supplementary screening\n\n35:51.260 --> 35:53.700\n paid by your insurance because you're in this category.\n\n35:53.700 --> 35:56.780\n Now you can say, how much science do we have behind it?\n\n35:56.780 --> 36:00.820\n Whatever, biological science or epidemiological evidence.\n\n36:00.820 --> 36:05.140\n So it turns out that between 40 and 50% of women\n\n36:05.140 --> 36:06.660\n have dense breasts.\n\n36:06.660 --> 36:11.140\n So about 40% of patients are coming out of their screening\n\n36:11.140 --> 36:15.020\n and somebody tells them, you are in high risk.\n\n36:15.020 --> 36:16.860\n Now, what exactly does it mean\n\n36:16.860 --> 36:19.620\n if you as half of the population in high risk?\n\n36:19.620 --> 36:22.060\n It's from saying, maybe I'm not,\n\n36:22.060 --> 36:23.700\n or what do I really need to do with it?\n\n36:23.700 --> 36:27.220\n Because the system doesn't provide me\n\n36:27.220 --> 36:28.340\n a lot of the solutions\n\n36:28.340 --> 36:30.140\n because there are so many people like me,\n\n36:30.140 --> 36:34.620\n we cannot really provide very expensive solutions for them.\n\n36:34.620 --> 36:38.740\n And the reason this whole density became this big deal,\n\n36:38.740 --> 36:40.820\n it's actually advocated by the patients\n\n36:40.820 --> 36:42.500\n who felt very unprotected\n\n36:42.500 --> 36:44.900\n because many women went and did the mammograms\n\n36:44.900 --> 36:46.260\n which were normal.\n\n36:46.260 --> 36:49.460\n And then it turns out that they already had cancer,\n\n36:49.460 --> 36:50.580\n quite developed cancer.\n\n36:50.580 --> 36:54.420\n So they didn't have a way to know who is really at risk\n\n36:54.420 --> 36:56.300\n and what is the likelihood that when the doctor tells you,\n\n36:56.300 --> 36:58.060\n you're okay, you are not okay.\n\n36:58.060 --> 37:02.140\n So at the time, and it was 15 years ago,\n\n37:02.140 --> 37:06.820\n this maybe was the best piece of science that we had.\n\n37:06.820 --> 37:11.820\n And it took quite 15, 16 years to make it federal law.\n\n37:12.180 --> 37:15.660\n But now this is a standard.\n\n37:15.660 --> 37:17.620\n Now with a deep learning model,\n\n37:17.620 --> 37:19.660\n we can so much more accurately predict\n\n37:19.660 --> 37:21.580\n who is gonna develop breast cancer\n\n37:21.580 --> 37:23.700\n just because you're trained on a logical thing.\n\n37:23.700 --> 37:26.060\n And instead of describing how much white\n\n37:26.060 --> 37:27.380\n and what kind of white machine\n\n37:27.380 --> 37:30.140\n can systematically identify the patterns,\n\n37:30.140 --> 37:32.780\n which was the original idea behind the thought\n\n37:32.780 --> 37:33.700\n of the cardiologist,\n\n37:33.700 --> 37:35.740\n machines can do it much more systematically\n\n37:35.740 --> 37:38.260\n and predict the risk when you're training the machine\n\n37:38.260 --> 37:42.140\n to look at the image and to say the risk in one to five years.\n\n37:42.140 --> 37:45.060\n Now you can ask me how long it will take\n\n37:45.060 --> 37:46.460\n to substitute this density,\n\n37:46.460 --> 37:48.620\n which is broadly used across the country\n\n37:48.620 --> 37:53.620\n and really is not helping to bring this new models.\n\n37:54.380 --> 37:56.700\n And I would say it's not a matter of the algorithm.\n\n37:56.700 --> 37:58.780\n Algorithms use already orders of magnitude better\n\n37:58.780 --> 38:00.460\n than what is currently in practice.\n\n38:00.460 --> 38:02.500\n I think it's really the question,\n\n38:02.500 --> 38:04.380\n who do you need to convince?\n\n38:04.380 --> 38:07.460\n How many hospitals do you need to run the experiment?\n\n38:07.460 --> 38:11.500\n What, you know, all this mechanism of adoption\n\n38:11.500 --> 38:15.180\n and how do you explain to patients\n\n38:15.180 --> 38:17.580\n and to women across the country\n\n38:17.580 --> 38:20.460\n that this is really a better measure?\n\n38:20.460 --> 38:22.740\n And again, I don't think it's an AI question.\n\n38:22.740 --> 38:25.940\n We can work more and make the algorithm even better,\n\n38:25.940 --> 38:29.300\n but I don't think that this is the current, you know,\n\n38:29.300 --> 38:32.060\n the barrier, the barrier is really this other piece\n\n38:32.060 --> 38:35.260\n that for some reason is not really explored.\n\n38:35.260 --> 38:36.860\n It's like anthropological piece.\n\n38:36.860 --> 38:39.860\n And coming back to your question about books,\n\n38:39.860 --> 38:42.980\n there is a book that I'm reading.\n\n38:42.980 --> 38:47.980\n It's called American Sickness by Elizabeth Rosenthal.\n\n38:48.260 --> 38:51.580\n And I got this book from my clinical collaborator,\n\n38:51.580 --> 38:53.100\n Dr. Connie Lehman.\n\n38:53.100 --> 38:54.820\n And I said, I know everything that I need to know\n\n38:54.820 --> 38:56.020\n about American health system,\n\n38:56.020 --> 38:59.220\n but you know, every page doesn't fail to surprise me.\n\n38:59.220 --> 39:03.140\n And I think there is a lot of interesting\n\n39:03.140 --> 39:06.860\n and really deep lessons for people like us\n\n39:06.860 --> 39:09.660\n from computer science who are coming into this field\n\n39:09.660 --> 39:13.660\n to really understand how complex is the system of incentives\n\n39:13.660 --> 39:17.660\n in the system to understand how you really need to play\n\n39:17.660 --> 39:18.780\n to drive adoption.\n\n39:19.740 --> 39:21.180\n You just said it's complex,\n\n39:21.180 --> 39:23.980\n but if we're trying to simplify it,\n\n39:23.980 --> 39:27.380\n who do you think most likely would be successful\n\n39:27.380 --> 39:29.540\n if we push on this group of people?\n\n39:29.540 --> 39:30.780\n Is it the doctors?\n\n39:30.780 --> 39:31.820\n Is it the hospitals?\n\n39:31.820 --> 39:34.300\n Is it the governments or policymakers?\n\n39:34.300 --> 39:37.380\n Is it the individual patients, consumers?\n\n39:38.860 --> 39:43.860\n Who needs to be inspired to most likely lead to adoption?\n\n39:45.180 --> 39:47.100\n Or is there no simple answer?\n\n39:47.100 --> 39:48.260\n There's no simple answer,\n\n39:48.260 --> 39:51.980\n but I think there is a lot of good people in medical system\n\n39:51.980 --> 39:55.180\n who do want to make a change.\n\n39:56.460 --> 40:01.460\n And I think a lot of power will come from us as consumers\n\n40:01.540 --> 40:04.260\n because we all are consumers or future consumers\n\n40:04.260 --> 40:06.500\n of healthcare services.\n\n40:06.500 --> 40:11.500\n And I think we can do so much more\n\n40:12.060 --> 40:15.500\n in explaining the potential and not in the hype terms\n\n40:15.500 --> 40:17.900\n and not saying that we now killed all Alzheimer\n\n40:17.900 --> 40:20.500\n and I'm really sick of reading this kind of articles\n\n40:20.500 --> 40:22.100\n which make these claims,\n\n40:22.100 --> 40:24.780\n but really to show with some examples\n\n40:24.780 --> 40:29.060\n what this implementation does and how it changes the care.\n\n40:29.060 --> 40:30.020\n Because I can't imagine,\n\n40:30.020 --> 40:33.220\n it doesn't matter what kind of politician it is,\n\n40:33.220 --> 40:35.220\n we all are susceptible to these diseases.\n\n40:35.220 --> 40:37.740\n There is no one who is free.\n\n40:37.740 --> 40:41.060\n And eventually, we all are humans\n\n40:41.060 --> 40:44.860\n and we're looking for a way to alleviate the suffering.\n\n40:44.860 --> 40:47.260\n And this is one possible way\n\n40:47.260 --> 40:49.300\n where we currently are under utilizing,\n\n40:49.300 --> 40:50.940\n which I think can help.\n\n40:51.860 --> 40:55.100\n So it sounds like the biggest problems are outside of AI\n\n40:55.100 --> 40:57.980\n in terms of the biggest impact at this point.\n\n40:57.980 --> 41:00.420\n But are there any open problems\n\n41:00.420 --> 41:03.780\n in the application of ML to oncology in general?\n\n41:03.780 --> 41:07.540\n So improving the detection or any other creative methods,\n\n41:07.540 --> 41:09.620\n whether it's on the detection segmentations\n\n41:09.620 --> 41:11.780\n or the vision perception side\n\n41:11.780 --> 41:16.260\n or some other clever of inference?\n\n41:16.260 --> 41:19.620\n Yeah, what in general in your view are the open problems\n\n41:19.620 --> 41:20.460\n in this space?\n\n41:20.460 --> 41:22.460\n Yeah, I just want to mention that beside detection,\n\n41:22.460 --> 41:24.820\n not the area where I am kind of quite active\n\n41:24.820 --> 41:28.580\n and I think it's really an increasingly important area\n\n41:28.580 --> 41:30.940\n in healthcare is drug design.\n\n41:32.260 --> 41:33.100\n Absolutely.\n\n41:33.100 --> 41:36.900\n Because it's fine if you detect something early,\n\n41:36.900 --> 41:41.100\n but you still need to get drugs\n\n41:41.100 --> 41:43.860\n and new drugs for these conditions.\n\n41:43.860 --> 41:46.740\n And today, all of the drug design,\n\n41:46.740 --> 41:48.300\n ML is non existent there.\n\n41:48.300 --> 41:52.980\n We don't have any drug that was developed by the ML model\n\n41:52.980 --> 41:54.900\n or even not developed,\n\n41:54.900 --> 41:57.060\n but at least even knew that ML model\n\n41:57.060 --> 41:59.260\n plays some significant role.\n\n41:59.260 --> 42:03.300\n I think this area with all the new ability\n\n42:03.300 --> 42:05.780\n to generate molecules with desired properties\n\n42:05.780 --> 42:10.780\n to do in silica screening is really a big open area.\n\n42:11.460 --> 42:12.740\n To be totally honest with you,\n\n42:12.740 --> 42:14.900\n when we are doing diagnostics and imaging,\n\n42:14.900 --> 42:17.260\n primarily taking the ideas that were developed\n\n42:17.260 --> 42:20.460\n for other areas and you applying them with some adaptation,\n\n42:20.460 --> 42:25.460\n the area of drug design is really technically interesting\n\n42:26.820 --> 42:27.980\n and exciting area.\n\n42:27.980 --> 42:30.380\n You need to work a lot with graphs\n\n42:30.380 --> 42:34.580\n and capture various 3D properties.\n\n42:34.580 --> 42:37.420\n There are lots and lots of opportunities\n\n42:37.420 --> 42:39.820\n to be technically creative.\n\n42:39.820 --> 42:44.820\n And I think there are a lot of open questions in this area.\n\n42:46.820 --> 42:48.820\n We're already getting a lot of successes\n\n42:48.820 --> 42:52.700\n even with kind of the first generation of these models,\n\n42:52.700 --> 42:56.500\n but there is much more new creative things that you can do.\n\n42:56.500 --> 42:59.260\n And what's very nice to see is that actually\n\n42:59.260 --> 43:04.180\n the more powerful, the more interesting models\n\n43:04.180 --> 43:05.460\n actually do do better.\n\n43:05.460 --> 43:10.460\n So there is a place to innovate in machine learning\n\n43:11.300 --> 43:12.540\n in this area.\n\n43:13.900 --> 43:16.820\n And some of these techniques are really unique to,\n\n43:16.820 --> 43:19.620\n let's say, to graph generation and other things.\n\n43:19.620 --> 43:20.820\n So...\n\n43:20.820 --> 43:23.980\n What, just to interrupt really quick, I'm sorry,\n\n43:23.980 --> 43:28.980\n graph generation or graphs, drug discovery in general,\n\n43:30.620 --> 43:31.940\n how do you discover a drug?\n\n43:31.940 --> 43:33.340\n Is this chemistry?\n\n43:33.340 --> 43:37.500\n Is this trying to predict different chemical reactions?\n\n43:37.500 --> 43:39.660\n Or is it some kind of...\n\n43:39.660 --> 43:42.100\n What do graphs even represent in this space?\n\n43:42.100 --> 43:43.980\n Oh, sorry, sorry.\n\n43:43.980 --> 43:45.340\n And what's a drug?\n\n43:45.340 --> 43:47.140\n Okay, so let's say you're thinking\n\n43:47.140 --> 43:48.540\n there are many different types of drugs,\n\n43:48.540 --> 43:50.580\n but let's say you're gonna talk about small molecules\n\n43:50.580 --> 43:52.860\n because I think today the majority of drugs\n\n43:52.860 --> 43:53.700\n are small molecules.\n\n43:53.700 --> 43:55.020\n So small molecule is a graph.\n\n43:55.020 --> 43:59.180\n The molecule is just where the node in the graph\n\n43:59.180 --> 44:01.500\n is an atom and then you have the bonds.\n\n44:01.500 --> 44:03.220\n So it's really a graph representation.\n\n44:03.220 --> 44:05.540\n If you look at it in 2D, correct,\n\n44:05.540 --> 44:07.460\n you can do it 3D, but let's say,\n\n44:07.460 --> 44:09.540\n let's keep it simple and stick in 2D.\n\n44:11.500 --> 44:14.740\n So pretty much my understanding today,\n\n44:14.740 --> 44:18.620\n how it is done at scale in the companies,\n\n44:18.620 --> 44:20.220\n without machine learning,\n\n44:20.220 --> 44:22.100\n you have high throughput screening.\n\n44:22.100 --> 44:23.740\n So you know that you are interested\n\n44:23.740 --> 44:26.540\n to get certain biological activity of the compound.\n\n44:26.540 --> 44:28.860\n So you scan a lot of compounds,\n\n44:28.860 --> 44:30.700\n like maybe hundreds of thousands,\n\n44:30.700 --> 44:32.980\n some really big number of compounds.\n\n44:32.980 --> 44:36.060\n You identify some compounds which have the right activity\n\n44:36.060 --> 44:39.220\n and then at this point, the chemists come\n\n44:39.220 --> 44:43.220\n and they're trying to now to optimize\n\n44:43.220 --> 44:45.340\n this original heat to different properties\n\n44:45.340 --> 44:47.180\n that you want it to be maybe soluble,\n\n44:47.180 --> 44:49.060\n you want it to decrease toxicity,\n\n44:49.060 --> 44:51.620\n you want it to decrease the side effects.\n\n44:51.620 --> 44:54.020\n Are those, sorry again to interrupt,\n\n44:54.020 --> 44:55.500\n can that be done in simulation\n\n44:55.500 --> 44:57.700\n or just by looking at the molecules\n\n44:57.700 --> 44:59.820\n or do you need to actually run reactions\n\n44:59.820 --> 45:02.460\n in real labs with lab coats and stuff?\n\n45:02.460 --> 45:04.020\n So when you do high throughput screening,\n\n45:04.020 --> 45:06.100\n you really do screening.\n\n45:06.100 --> 45:07.020\n It's in the lab.\n\n45:07.020 --> 45:09.140\n It's really the lab screening.\n\n45:09.140 --> 45:10.980\n You screen the molecules, correct?\n\n45:10.980 --> 45:12.580\n I don't know what screening is.\n\n45:12.580 --> 45:15.060\n The screening is just check them for certain property.\n\n45:15.060 --> 45:17.260\n Like in the physical space, in the physical world,\n\n45:17.260 --> 45:18.740\n like actually there's a machine probably\n\n45:18.740 --> 45:21.420\n that's actually running the reaction.\n\n45:21.420 --> 45:22.900\n Actually running the reactions, yeah.\n\n45:22.900 --> 45:25.420\n So there is a process where you can run\n\n45:25.420 --> 45:26.660\n and that's why it's called high throughput\n\n45:26.660 --> 45:29.580\n that it become cheaper and faster\n\n45:29.580 --> 45:33.820\n to do it on very big number of molecules.\n\n45:33.820 --> 45:35.820\n You run the screening,\n\n45:35.820 --> 45:40.300\n you identify potential good starts\n\n45:40.300 --> 45:42.340\n and then when the chemists come in\n\n45:42.340 --> 45:44.060\n who have done it many times\n\n45:44.060 --> 45:46.180\n and then they can try to look at it and say,\n\n45:46.180 --> 45:48.260\n how can you change the molecule\n\n45:48.260 --> 45:51.780\n to get the desired profile\n\n45:51.780 --> 45:53.460\n in terms of all other properties?\n\n45:53.460 --> 45:56.500\n So maybe how do I make it more bioactive and so on?\n\n45:56.500 --> 45:59.460\n And there the creativity of the chemists\n\n45:59.460 --> 46:03.980\n really is the one that determines the success\n\n46:03.980 --> 46:07.460\n of this design because again,\n\n46:07.460 --> 46:09.300\n they have a lot of domain knowledge\n\n46:09.300 --> 46:12.900\n of what works, how do you decrease the CCD and so on\n\n46:12.900 --> 46:15.020\n and that's what they do.\n\n46:15.020 --> 46:17.860\n So all the drugs that are currently\n\n46:17.860 --> 46:20.220\n in the FDA approved drugs\n\n46:20.220 --> 46:22.140\n or even drugs that are in clinical trials,\n\n46:22.140 --> 46:27.100\n they are designed using these domain experts\n\n46:27.100 --> 46:30.060\n which goes through this combinatorial space\n\n46:30.060 --> 46:31.940\n of molecules or graphs or whatever\n\n46:31.940 --> 46:35.140\n and find the right one or adjust it to be the right ones.\n\n46:35.140 --> 46:38.060\n It sounds like the breast density heuristic\n\n46:38.060 --> 46:40.460\n from 67 to the same echoes.\n\n46:40.460 --> 46:41.820\n It's not necessarily that.\n\n46:41.820 --> 46:45.380\n It's really driven by deep understanding.\n\n46:45.380 --> 46:46.820\n It's not like they just observe it.\n\n46:46.820 --> 46:48.540\n I mean, they do deeply understand chemistry\n\n46:48.540 --> 46:50.460\n and they do understand how different groups\n\n46:50.460 --> 46:53.140\n and how does it changes the properties.\n\n46:53.140 --> 46:56.660\n So there is a lot of science that gets into it\n\n46:56.660 --> 46:58.740\n and a lot of kind of simulation,\n\n46:58.740 --> 47:00.940\n how do you want it to behave?\n\n47:01.900 --> 47:03.900\n It's very, very complex.\n\n47:03.900 --> 47:06.140\n So they're quite effective at this design, obviously.\n\n47:06.140 --> 47:08.420\n Now effective, yeah, we have drugs.\n\n47:08.420 --> 47:10.780\n Like depending on how do you measure effective,\n\n47:10.780 --> 47:13.940\n if you measure it in terms of cost, it's prohibitive.\n\n47:13.940 --> 47:15.820\n If you measure it in terms of times,\n\n47:15.820 --> 47:18.420\n we have lots of diseases for which we don't have any drugs\n\n47:18.420 --> 47:20.060\n and we don't even know how to approach\n\n47:20.060 --> 47:23.460\n and don't need to mention few drugs\n\n47:23.460 --> 47:27.140\n or neurodegenerative disease drugs that fail.\n\n47:27.140 --> 47:32.140\n So there are lots of trials that fail in later stages,\n\n47:32.180 --> 47:35.180\n which is really catastrophic from the financial perspective.\n\n47:35.180 --> 47:39.540\n So is it the effective, the most effective mechanism?\n\n47:39.540 --> 47:42.700\n Absolutely no, but this is the only one that currently works.\n\n47:44.300 --> 47:47.900\n And I was closely interacting\n\n47:47.900 --> 47:49.260\n with people in pharmaceutical industry.\n\n47:49.260 --> 47:51.340\n I was really fascinated on how sharp\n\n47:51.340 --> 47:55.260\n and what a deep understanding of the domain do they have.\n\n47:55.260 --> 47:57.020\n It's not observation driven.\n\n47:57.020 --> 48:00.220\n There is really a lot of science behind what they do.\n\n48:00.220 --> 48:02.300\n But if you ask me, can machine learning change it,\n\n48:02.300 --> 48:05.300\n I firmly believe yes,\n\n48:05.300 --> 48:07.860\n because even the most experienced chemists\n\n48:07.860 --> 48:11.100\n cannot hold in their memory and understanding\n\n48:11.100 --> 48:12.500\n everything that you can learn\n\n48:12.500 --> 48:15.420\n from millions of molecules and reactions.\n\n48:17.220 --> 48:19.900\n And the space of graphs is a totally new space.\n\n48:19.900 --> 48:22.060\n I mean, it's a really interesting space\n\n48:22.060 --> 48:23.980\n for machine learning to explore, graph generation.\n\n48:23.980 --> 48:26.260\n Yeah, so there are a lot of things that you can do here.\n\n48:26.260 --> 48:28.740\n So we do a lot of work.\n\n48:28.740 --> 48:31.620\n So the first tool that we started with\n\n48:31.620 --> 48:36.300\n was the tool that can predict properties of the molecules.\n\n48:36.300 --> 48:39.420\n So you can just give the molecule and the property.\n\n48:39.420 --> 48:41.340\n It can be by activity property,\n\n48:41.340 --> 48:44.300\n or it can be some other property.\n\n48:44.300 --> 48:46.460\n And you train the molecules\n\n48:46.460 --> 48:50.020\n and you can now take a new molecule\n\n48:50.020 --> 48:52.180\n and predict this property.\n\n48:52.180 --> 48:54.860\n Now, when people started working in this area,\n\n48:54.860 --> 48:55.980\n it is something very simple.\n\n48:55.980 --> 48:58.580\n They do kind of existing fingerprints,\n\n48:58.580 --> 49:00.740\n which is kind of handcrafted features of the molecule.\n\n49:00.740 --> 49:02.980\n When you break the graph to substructures\n\n49:02.980 --> 49:05.980\n and then you run it in a feed forward neural network.\n\n49:05.980 --> 49:08.500\n And what was interesting to see that clearly,\n\n49:08.500 --> 49:11.020\n this was not the most effective way to proceed.\n\n49:11.020 --> 49:14.060\n And you need to have much more complex models\n\n49:14.060 --> 49:16.300\n that can induce a representation,\n\n49:16.300 --> 49:19.220\n which can translate this graph into the embeddings\n\n49:19.220 --> 49:21.300\n and do these predictions.\n\n49:21.300 --> 49:23.220\n So this is one direction.\n\n49:23.220 --> 49:25.260\n Then another direction, which is kind of related\n\n49:25.260 --> 49:29.180\n is not only to stop by looking at the embedding itself,\n\n49:29.180 --> 49:32.780\n but actually modify it to produce better molecules.\n\n49:32.780 --> 49:36.020\n So you can think about it as machine translation\n\n49:36.020 --> 49:38.140\n that you can start with a molecule\n\n49:38.140 --> 49:40.580\n and then there is an improved version of molecule.\n\n49:40.580 --> 49:42.860\n And you can again, with encoder translate it\n\n49:42.860 --> 49:45.380\n into the hidden space and then learn how to modify it\n\n49:45.380 --> 49:49.340\n to improve the in some ways version of the molecules.\n\n49:49.340 --> 49:52.620\n So that's, it's kind of really exciting.\n\n49:52.620 --> 49:54.740\n We already have seen that the property prediction\n\n49:54.740 --> 49:56.140\n works pretty well.\n\n49:56.140 --> 49:59.780\n And now we are generating molecules\n\n49:59.780 --> 50:01.820\n and there is actually labs\n\n50:01.820 --> 50:04.180\n which are manufacturing this molecule.\n\n50:04.180 --> 50:06.340\n So we'll see where it will get us.\n\n50:06.340 --> 50:07.780\n Okay, that's really exciting.\n\n50:07.780 --> 50:08.860\n There's a lot of promise.\n\n50:08.860 --> 50:11.820\n Speaking of machine translation and embeddings,\n\n50:11.820 --> 50:15.580\n I think you have done a lot of really great research\n\n50:15.580 --> 50:17.540\n in NLP, natural language processing.\n\n50:19.260 --> 50:21.540\n Can you tell me your journey through NLP?\n\n50:21.540 --> 50:25.100\n What ideas, problems, approaches were you working on?\n\n50:25.100 --> 50:28.180\n Were you fascinated with, did you explore\n\n50:28.180 --> 50:33.180\n before this magic of deep learning reemerged and after?\n\n50:34.020 --> 50:37.180\n So when I started my work in NLP, it was in 97.\n\n50:38.180 --> 50:39.460\n This was very interesting time.\n\n50:39.460 --> 50:42.620\n It was exactly the time that I came to ACL.\n\n50:43.500 --> 50:46.140\n And at the time I could barely understand English,\n\n50:46.140 --> 50:48.500\n but it was exactly like the transition point\n\n50:48.500 --> 50:53.500\n because half of the papers were really rule based approaches\n\n50:53.500 --> 50:56.180\n where people took more kind of heavy linguistic approaches\n\n50:56.180 --> 51:00.060\n for small domains and try to build up from there.\n\n51:00.060 --> 51:02.220\n And then there were the first generation of papers\n\n51:02.220 --> 51:04.500\n which were corpus based papers.\n\n51:04.500 --> 51:06.420\n And they were very simple in our terms\n\n51:06.420 --> 51:07.900\n when you collect some statistics\n\n51:07.900 --> 51:10.020\n and do prediction based on them.\n\n51:10.020 --> 51:13.100\n And I found it really fascinating that one community\n\n51:13.100 --> 51:18.100\n can think so very differently about the problem.\n\n51:19.220 --> 51:22.820\n And I remember my first paper that I wrote,\n\n51:22.820 --> 51:24.460\n it didn't have a single formula.\n\n51:24.460 --> 51:25.740\n It didn't have evaluation.\n\n51:25.740 --> 51:28.340\n It just had examples of outputs.\n\n51:28.340 --> 51:32.020\n And this was a standard of the field at the time.\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:35.860\n In some ways, I mean, people maybe just started emphasizing\n\n51:35.860 --> 51:38.940\n the empirical evaluation, but for many applications\n\n51:38.940 --> 51:42.780\n like summarization, you just show some examples of outputs.\n\n51:42.780 --> 51:45.460\n And then increasingly you can see that how\n\n51:45.460 --> 51:48.300\n the statistical approaches dominated the field\n\n51:48.300 --> 51:52.100\n and we've seen increased performance\n\n51:52.100 --> 51:56.020\n across many basic tasks.\n\n51:56.020 --> 52:00.420\n The sad part of the story maybe that if you look again\n\n52:00.420 --> 52:05.100\n through this journey, we see that the role of linguistics\n\n52:05.100 --> 52:07.460\n in some ways greatly diminishes.\n\n52:07.460 --> 52:11.580\n And I think that you really need to look\n\n52:11.580 --> 52:14.540\n through the whole proceeding to find one or two papers\n\n52:14.540 --> 52:17.260\n which make some interesting linguistic references.\n\n52:17.260 --> 52:18.100\n It's really big.\n\n52:18.100 --> 52:18.920\n Today, yeah.\n\n52:18.920 --> 52:19.760\n Today, today.\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:20.600\n This was definitely one of the.\n\n52:20.600 --> 52:23.140\n Things like syntactic trees, just even basically\n\n52:23.140 --> 52:26.180\n against our conversation about human understanding\n\n52:26.180 --> 52:30.300\n of language, which I guess what linguistics would be\n\n52:30.300 --> 52:34.300\n structured, hierarchical representing language\n\n52:34.300 --> 52:37.140\n in a way that's human explainable, understandable\n\n52:37.140 --> 52:39.500\n is missing today.\n\n52:39.500 --> 52:42.380\n I don't know if it is, what is explainable\n\n52:42.380 --> 52:43.620\n and understandable.\n\n52:43.620 --> 52:47.360\n In the end, we perform functions and it's okay\n\n52:47.360 --> 52:50.140\n to have machine which performs a function.\n\n52:50.140 --> 52:53.200\n Like when you're thinking about your calculator, correct?\n\n52:53.200 --> 52:56.100\n Your calculator can do calculation very different\n\n52:56.100 --> 52:57.620\n from you would do the calculation,\n\n52:57.620 --> 52:58.860\n but it's very effective in it.\n\n52:58.860 --> 53:02.560\n And this is fine if we can achieve certain tasks\n\n53:02.560 --> 53:05.760\n with high accuracy, doesn't necessarily mean\n\n53:05.760 --> 53:09.300\n that it has to understand it the same way as we understand.\n\n53:09.300 --> 53:11.260\n In some ways, it's even naive to request\n\n53:11.260 --> 53:14.940\n because you have so many other sources of information\n\n53:14.940 --> 53:17.900\n that are absent when you are training your system.\n\n53:17.900 --> 53:19.220\n So it's okay.\n\n53:19.220 --> 53:20.060\n Is it delivered?\n\n53:20.060 --> 53:21.500\n And I would tell you one application\n\n53:21.500 --> 53:22.780\n that is really fascinating.\n\n53:22.780 --> 53:25.060\n In 97, when it came to ACL, there were some papers\n\n53:25.060 --> 53:25.900\n on machine translation.\n\n53:25.900 --> 53:27.440\n They were like primitive.\n\n53:27.440 --> 53:31.060\n Like people were trying really, really simple.\n\n53:31.060 --> 53:34.260\n And the feeling, my feeling was that, you know,\n\n53:34.260 --> 53:36.260\n to make real machine translation system,\n\n53:36.260 --> 53:39.580\n it's like to fly at the moon and build a house there\n\n53:39.580 --> 53:41.580\n and the garden and live happily ever after.\n\n53:41.580 --> 53:42.600\n I mean, it's like impossible.\n\n53:42.600 --> 53:46.740\n I never could imagine that within, you know, 10 years,\n\n53:46.740 --> 53:48.540\n we would already see the system working.\n\n53:48.540 --> 53:51.420\n And now, you know, nobody is even surprised\n\n53:51.420 --> 53:54.420\n to utilize the system on daily basis.\n\n53:54.420 --> 53:56.220\n So this was like a huge, huge progress,\n\n53:56.220 --> 53:57.860\n saying that people for very long time\n\n53:57.860 --> 54:00.820\n tried to solve using other mechanisms.\n\n54:00.820 --> 54:03.220\n And they were unable to solve it.\n\n54:03.220 --> 54:06.140\n That's why coming back to your question about biology,\n\n54:06.140 --> 54:10.800\n that, you know, in linguistics, people try to go this way\n\n54:10.800 --> 54:13.500\n and try to write the syntactic trees\n\n54:13.500 --> 54:17.500\n and try to abstract it and to find the right representation.\n\n54:17.500 --> 54:22.240\n And, you know, they couldn't get very far\n\n54:22.240 --> 54:26.580\n with this understanding while these models using,\n\n54:26.580 --> 54:29.640\n you know, other sources actually capable\n\n54:29.640 --> 54:31.680\n to make a lot of progress.\n\n54:31.680 --> 54:33.960\n Now, I'm not naive to think\n\n54:33.960 --> 54:36.780\n that we are in this paradise space in NLP.\n\n54:36.780 --> 54:38.580\n And sure as you know,\n\n54:38.580 --> 54:40.860\n that when we slightly change the domain\n\n54:40.860 --> 54:42.620\n and when we decrease the amount of training,\n\n54:42.620 --> 54:44.740\n it can do like really bizarre and funny thing.\n\n54:44.740 --> 54:46.500\n But I think it's just a matter\n\n54:46.500 --> 54:48.540\n of improving generalization capacity,\n\n54:48.540 --> 54:51.500\n which is just a technical question.\n\n54:51.500 --> 54:54.340\n Wow, so that's the question.\n\n54:54.340 --> 54:57.720\n How much of language understanding can be solved\n\n54:57.720 --> 54:59.180\n with deep neural networks?\n\n54:59.180 --> 55:03.740\n In your intuition, I mean, it's unknown, I suppose.\n\n55:03.740 --> 55:07.660\n But as we start to creep towards romantic notions\n\n55:07.660 --> 55:10.620\n of the spirit of the Turing test\n\n55:10.620 --> 55:14.220\n and conversation and dialogue\n\n55:14.220 --> 55:18.340\n and something that maybe to me or to us,\n\n55:18.340 --> 55:21.620\n so the humans feels like it needs real understanding.\n\n55:21.620 --> 55:23.500\n How much can that be achieved\n\n55:23.500 --> 55:27.180\n with these neural networks or statistical methods?\n\n55:27.180 --> 55:32.180\n So I guess I am very much driven by the outcomes.\n\n55:33.340 --> 55:35.420\n Can we achieve the performance\n\n55:35.420 --> 55:40.420\n which would be satisfactory for us for different tasks?\n\n55:40.700 --> 55:43.020\n Now, if you again look at machine translation system,\n\n55:43.020 --> 55:46.020\n which are trained on large amounts of data,\n\n55:46.020 --> 55:48.780\n they really can do a remarkable job\n\n55:48.780 --> 55:51.300\n relatively to where they've been a few years ago.\n\n55:51.300 --> 55:54.620\n And if you project into the future,\n\n55:54.620 --> 55:59.380\n if it will be the same speed of improvement, you know,\n\n55:59.380 --> 56:00.220\n this is great.\n\n56:00.220 --> 56:01.060\n Now, does it bother me\n\n56:01.060 --> 56:04.860\n that it's not doing the same translation as we are doing?\n\n56:04.860 --> 56:06.620\n Now, if you go to cognitive science,\n\n56:06.620 --> 56:09.460\n we still don't really understand what we are doing.\n\n56:10.460 --> 56:11.860\n I mean, there are a lot of theories\n\n56:11.860 --> 56:13.840\n and there's obviously a lot of progress and studying,\n\n56:13.840 --> 56:17.540\n but our understanding what exactly goes on in our brains\n\n56:17.540 --> 56:21.020\n when we process language is still not crystal clear\n\n56:21.020 --> 56:25.460\n and precise that we can translate it into machines.\n\n56:25.460 --> 56:29.220\n What does bother me is that, you know,\n\n56:29.220 --> 56:31.700\n again, that machines can be extremely brittle\n\n56:31.700 --> 56:33.980\n when you go out of your comfort zone\n\n56:33.980 --> 56:36.060\n of when there is a distributional shift\n\n56:36.060 --> 56:37.300\n between training and testing.\n\n56:37.300 --> 56:39.020\n And it have been years and years,\n\n56:39.020 --> 56:41.320\n every year when I teach an LP class,\n\n56:41.320 --> 56:43.560\n now show them some examples of translation\n\n56:43.560 --> 56:47.300\n from some newspaper in Hebrew or whatever, it was perfect.\n\n56:47.300 --> 56:51.300\n And then I have a recipe that Tomi Yakel's system\n\n56:51.300 --> 56:53.900\n sent me a while ago and it was written in Finnish\n\n56:53.900 --> 56:55.720\n of Karelian pies.\n\n56:55.720 --> 56:59.280\n And it's just a terrible translation.\n\n56:59.280 --> 57:01.460\n You cannot understand anything what it does.\n\n57:01.460 --> 57:04.180\n It's not like some syntactic mistakes, it's just terrible.\n\n57:04.180 --> 57:07.020\n And year after year, I tried and will translate\n\n57:07.020 --> 57:08.980\n and year after year, it does this terrible work\n\n57:08.980 --> 57:10.980\n because I guess, you know, the recipes\n\n57:10.980 --> 57:14.580\n are not a big part of their training repertoire.\n\n57:14.580 --> 57:19.020\n So, but in terms of outcomes, that's a really clean,\n\n57:19.020 --> 57:20.240\n good way to look at it.\n\n57:21.100 --> 57:23.140\n I guess the question I was asking is,\n\n57:24.060 --> 57:27.700\n do you think, imagine a future,\n\n57:27.700 --> 57:30.540\n do you think the current approaches can pass\n\n57:30.540 --> 57:32.460\n the Turing test in the way,\n\n57:34.700 --> 57:37.060\n in the best possible formulation of the Turing test?\n\n57:37.060 --> 57:39.460\n Which is, would you wanna have a conversation\n\n57:39.460 --> 57:42.340\n with a neural network for an hour?\n\n57:42.340 --> 57:45.820\n Oh God, no, no, there are not that many people\n\n57:45.820 --> 57:48.380\n that I would want to talk for an hour, but.\n\n57:48.380 --> 57:51.500\n There are some people in this world, alive or not,\n\n57:51.500 --> 57:53.260\n that you would like to talk to for an hour.\n\n57:53.260 --> 57:56.700\n Could a neural network achieve that outcome?\n\n57:56.700 --> 57:58.860\n So I think it would be really hard to create\n\n57:58.860 --> 58:02.300\n a successful training set, which would enable it\n\n58:02.300 --> 58:04.980\n to have a conversation, a contextual conversation\n\n58:04.980 --> 58:05.820\n for an hour.\n\n58:05.820 --> 58:08.140\n Do you think it's a problem of data, perhaps?\n\n58:08.140 --> 58:09.940\n I think in some ways it's not a problem of data,\n\n58:09.940 --> 58:13.620\n it's a problem both of data and the problem of\n\n58:13.620 --> 58:15.780\n the way we're training our systems,\n\n58:15.780 --> 58:18.060\n their ability to truly, to generalize,\n\n58:18.060 --> 58:19.300\n to be very compositional.\n\n58:19.300 --> 58:23.220\n In some ways it's limited in the current capacity,\n\n58:23.220 --> 58:27.980\n at least we can translate well,\n\n58:27.980 --> 58:32.540\n we can find information well, we can extract information.\n\n58:32.540 --> 58:35.180\n So there are many capacities in which it's doing very well.\n\n58:35.180 --> 58:38.000\n And you can ask me, would you trust the machine\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:39.820\n to translate for you and use it as a source?\n\n58:39.820 --> 58:42.580\n I would say absolutely, especially if we're talking about\n\n58:42.580 --> 58:45.660\n newspaper data or other data which is in the realm\n\n58:45.660 --> 58:47.900\n of its own training set, I would say yes.\n\n58:48.900 --> 58:52.900\n But having conversations with the machine,\n\n58:52.900 --> 58:56.460\n it's not something that I would choose to do.\n\n58:56.460 --> 58:59.420\n But I would tell you something, talking about Turing tests\n\n58:59.420 --> 59:02.940\n and about all this kind of ELISA conversations,\n\n59:02.940 --> 59:05.540\n I remember visiting Tencent in China\n\n59:05.540 --> 59:07.620\n and they have this chat board and they claim\n\n59:07.620 --> 59:10.780\n there is really humongous amount of the local population\n\n59:10.780 --> 59:12.940\n which for hours talks to the chat board.\n\n59:12.940 --> 59:15.340\n To me it was, I cannot believe it,\n\n59:15.340 --> 59:18.000\n but apparently it's documented that there are some people\n\n59:18.000 --> 59:20.760\n who enjoy this conversation.\n\n59:20.760 --> 59:24.540\n And it brought to me another MIT story\n\n59:24.540 --> 59:26.980\n about ELISA and Weisenbaum.\n\n59:26.980 --> 59:29.340\n I don't know if you're familiar with the story.\n\n59:29.340 --> 59:31.020\n So Weisenbaum was a professor at MIT\n\n59:31.020 --> 59:32.580\n and when he developed this ELISA,\n\n59:32.580 --> 59:34.620\n which was just doing string matching,\n\n59:34.620 --> 59:38.540\n very trivial, like restating of what you said\n\n59:38.540 --> 59:41.260\n with very few rules, no syntax.\n\n59:41.260 --> 59:43.740\n Apparently there were secretaries at MIT\n\n59:43.740 --> 59:48.180\n that would sit for hours and converse with this trivial thing\n\n59:48.180 --> 59:50.180\n and at the time there was no beautiful interfaces\n\n59:50.180 --> 59:51.820\n so you actually need to go through the pain\n\n59:51.820 --> 59:53.540\n of communicating.\n\n59:53.540 --> 59:56.940\n And Weisenbaum himself was so horrified by this phenomenon\n\n59:56.940 --> 59:59.300\n that people can believe enough to the machine\n\n59:59.300 --> 1:00:00.820\n that you just need to give them the hint\n\n1:00:00.820 --> 1:00:03.940\n that machine understands you and you can complete the rest\n\n1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:05.420\n that he kind of stopped this research\n\n1:00:05.420 --> 1:00:08.660\n and went into kind of trying to understand\n\n1:00:08.660 --> 1:00:11.480\n what this artificial intelligence can do to our brains.\n\n1:00:12.740 --> 1:00:14.380\n So my point is, you know,\n\n1:00:14.380 --> 1:00:19.300\n how much, it's not how good is the technology,\n\n1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:22.620\n it's how ready we are to believe\n\n1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:25.580\n that it delivers the goods that we are trying to get.\n\n1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:27.200\n That's a really beautiful way to put it.\n\n1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:29.800\n I, by the way, I'm not horrified by that possibility,\n\n1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:33.140\n but inspired by it because,\n\n1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:35.920\n I mean, human connection,\n\n1:00:35.920 --> 1:00:38.220\n whether it's through language or through love,\n\n1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:44.860\n it seems like it's very amenable to machine learning\n\n1:00:44.900 --> 1:00:49.340\n and the rest is just challenges of psychology.\n\n1:00:49.340 --> 1:00:52.460\n Like you said, the secretaries who enjoy spending hours.\n\n1:00:52.460 --> 1:00:55.020\n I would say I would describe most of our lives\n\n1:00:55.020 --> 1:00:58.020\n as enjoying spending hours with those we love\n\n1:00:58.020 --> 1:01:00.820\n for very silly reasons.\n\n1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:02.780\n All we're doing is keyword matching as well.\n\n1:01:02.780 --> 1:01:05.100\n So I'm not sure how much intelligence\n\n1:01:05.100 --> 1:01:08.140\n we exhibit to each other with the people we love\n\n1:01:08.140 --> 1:01:09.820\n that we're close with.\n\n1:01:09.820 --> 1:01:12.660\n So it's a very interesting point\n\n1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:16.020\n of what it means to pass the Turing test with language.\n\n1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:16.860\n I think you're right.\n\n1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:18.220\n In terms of conversation,\n\n1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:20.180\n I think machine translation\n\n1:01:21.420 --> 1:01:24.420\n has very clear performance and improvement, right?\n\n1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:28.020\n What it means to have a fulfilling conversation\n\n1:01:28.020 --> 1:01:32.660\n is very person dependent and context dependent\n\n1:01:32.660 --> 1:01:33.580\n and so on.\n\n1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:36.340\n That's, yeah, it's very well put.\n\n1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:40.740\n But in your view, what's a benchmark in natural language,\n\n1:01:40.740 --> 1:01:43.640\n a test that's just out of reach right now,\n\n1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:46.020\n but we might be able to, that's exciting.\n\n1:01:46.020 --> 1:01:49.100\n Is it in perfecting machine translation\n\n1:01:49.100 --> 1:01:51.900\n or is there other, is it summarization?\n\n1:01:51.900 --> 1:01:52.740\n What's out there just out of reach?\n\n1:01:52.740 --> 1:01:55.820\n I think it goes across specific application.\n\n1:01:55.820 --> 1:01:59.500\n It's more about the ability to learn from few examples\n\n1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:03.300\n for real, what we call few short learning and all these cases\n\n1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:05.940\n because the way we publish these papers today,\n\n1:02:05.940 --> 1:02:09.900\n we say, if we have like naively, we get 55,\n\n1:02:09.900 --> 1:02:12.500\n but now we had a few example and we can move to 65.\n\n1:02:12.500 --> 1:02:13.540\n None of these methods\n\n1:02:13.540 --> 1:02:15.980\n actually are realistically doing anything useful.\n\n1:02:15.980 --> 1:02:18.540\n You cannot use them today.\n\n1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:23.540\n And the ability to be able to generalize and to move\n\n1:02:25.460 --> 1:02:28.940\n or to be autonomous in finding the data\n\n1:02:28.940 --> 1:02:30.300\n that you need to learn,\n\n1:02:31.340 --> 1:02:34.280\n to be able to perfect new tasks or new language,\n\n1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:38.100\n this is an area where I think we really need\n\n1:02:39.200 --> 1:02:43.020\n to move forward to and we are not yet there.\n\n1:02:43.020 --> 1:02:45.060\n Are you at all excited,\n\n1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:46.540\n curious by the possibility\n\n1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:48.520\n of creating human level intelligence?\n\n1:02:49.900 --> 1:02:52.540\n Is this, cause you've been very in your discussion.\n\n1:02:52.540 --> 1:02:54.340\n So if we look at oncology,\n\n1:02:54.340 --> 1:02:58.100\n you're trying to use machine learning to help the world\n\n1:02:58.100 --> 1:02:59.700\n in terms of alleviating suffering.\n\n1:02:59.700 --> 1:03:02.340\n If you look at natural language processing,\n\n1:03:02.340 --> 1:03:05.300\n you're focused on the outcomes of improving practical things\n\n1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:06.820\n like machine translation.\n\n1:03:06.820 --> 1:03:09.880\n But human level intelligence is a thing\n\n1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:13.800\n that our civilization has dreamed about creating,\n\n1:03:13.800 --> 1:03:15.740\n super human level intelligence.\n\n1:03:15.740 --> 1:03:16.940\n Do you think about this?\n\n1:03:16.940 --> 1:03:19.040\n Do you think it's at all within our reach?\n\n1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:22.660\n So as you said yourself, Elie,\n\n1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:26.140\n talking about how do you perceive\n\n1:03:26.140 --> 1:03:28.980\n our communications with each other,\n\n1:03:28.980 --> 1:03:31.940\n that we're matching keywords and certain behaviors\n\n1:03:31.940 --> 1:03:33.020\n and so on.\n\n1:03:33.020 --> 1:03:36.860\n So at the end, whenever one assesses,\n\n1:03:36.860 --> 1:03:38.680\n let's say relations with another person,\n\n1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.460\n you have separate kind of measurements and outcomes\n\n1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:43.620\n inside your head that determine\n\n1:03:43.620 --> 1:03:45.860\n what is the status of the relation.\n\n1:03:45.860 --> 1:03:48.580\n So one way, this is this classical level,\n\n1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:49.600\n what is the intelligence?\n\n1:03:49.600 --> 1:03:51.860\n Is it the fact that now we are gonna do the same way\n\n1:03:51.860 --> 1:03:52.940\n as human is doing,\n\n1:03:52.940 --> 1:03:55.500\n when we don't even understand what the human is doing?\n\n1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:59.100\n Or we now have an ability to deliver these outcomes,\n\n1:03:59.100 --> 1:04:01.300\n but not in one area, not in NLP,\n\n1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:03.940\n not just to translate or just to answer questions,\n\n1:04:03.940 --> 1:04:05.380\n but across many, many areas\n\n1:04:05.380 --> 1:04:08.100\n that we can achieve the functionalities\n\n1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:11.060\n that humans can achieve with their ability to learn\n\n1:04:11.060 --> 1:04:12.380\n and do other things.\n\n1:04:12.380 --> 1:04:15.500\n I think this is, and this we can actually measure\n\n1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:17.560\n how far we are.\n\n1:04:17.560 --> 1:04:21.580\n And that's what makes me excited that we,\n\n1:04:21.580 --> 1:04:23.780\n in my lifetime, at least so far what we've seen,\n\n1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:25.840\n it's like tremendous progress\n\n1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:28.700\n across these different functionalities.\n\n1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:32.260\n And I think it will be really exciting\n\n1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:35.540\n to see where we will be.\n\n1:04:35.540 --> 1:04:39.300\n And again, one way to think about it,\n\n1:04:39.300 --> 1:04:41.820\n there are machines which are improving their functionality.\n\n1:04:41.820 --> 1:04:44.940\n Another one is to think about us with our brains,\n\n1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:46.420\n which are imperfect,\n\n1:04:46.420 --> 1:04:51.420\n how they can be accelerated by this technology\n\n1:04:51.420 --> 1:04:55.900\n as it becomes stronger and stronger.\n\n1:04:55.900 --> 1:04:57.260\n Coming back to another book\n\n1:04:57.260 --> 1:05:01.060\n that I love, Flowers for Algernon.\n\n1:05:01.060 --> 1:05:02.100\n Have you read this book?\n\n1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:02.940\n Yes.\n\n1:05:02.940 --> 1:05:05.700\n So there is this point that the patient gets\n\n1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:07.980\n this miracle cure, which changes his brain.\n\n1:05:07.980 --> 1:05:11.020\n And all of a sudden they see life in a different way\n\n1:05:11.020 --> 1:05:13.300\n and can do certain things better,\n\n1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:14.860\n but certain things much worse.\n\n1:05:14.860 --> 1:05:19.860\n So you can imagine this kind of computer augmented cognition\n\n1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:24.800\n where it can bring you that now in the same way\n\n1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:28.120\n as the cars enable us to get to places\n\n1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:30.080\n where we've never been before,\n\n1:05:30.080 --> 1:05:31.640\n can we think differently?\n\n1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:33.600\n Can we think faster?\n\n1:05:33.600 --> 1:05:36.680\n And we already see a lot of it happening\n\n1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:38.260\n in how it impacts us,\n\n1:05:38.260 --> 1:05:42.200\n but I think we have a long way to go there.\n\n1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:45.040\n So that's sort of artificial intelligence\n\n1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:47.280\n and technology affecting our,\n\n1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:50.440\n augmenting our intelligence as humans.\n\n1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:55.440\n Yesterday, a company called Neuralink announced,\n\n1:05:55.520 --> 1:05:56.800\n they did this whole demonstration.\n\n1:05:56.800 --> 1:05:57.980\n I don't know if you saw it.\n\n1:05:57.980 --> 1:06:01.000\n It's, they demonstrated brain computer,\n\n1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:02.680\n brain machine interface,\n\n1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:06.360\n where there's like a sewing machine for the brain.\n\n1:06:06.360 --> 1:06:11.120\n Do you, you know, a lot of that is quite out there\n\n1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:14.040\n in terms of things that some people would say\n\n1:06:14.040 --> 1:06:16.340\n are impossible, but they're dreamers\n\n1:06:16.340 --> 1:06:18.080\n and want to engineer systems like that.\n\n1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:20.360\n Do you see, based on what you just said,\n\n1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:23.820\n a hope for that more direct interaction with the brain?\n\n1:06:25.120 --> 1:06:27.040\n I think there are different ways.\n\n1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.000\n One is a direct interaction with the brain.\n\n1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.900\n And again, there are lots of companies\n\n1:06:30.900 --> 1:06:32.280\n that work in this space\n\n1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:35.080\n and I think there will be a lot of developments.\n\n1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:36.600\n But I'm just thinking that many times\n\n1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:39.080\n we are not aware of our feelings,\n\n1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:41.400\n of motivation, what drives us.\n\n1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:44.200\n Like, let me give you a trivial example, our attention.\n\n1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:47.260\n There are a lot of studies that demonstrate\n\n1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:49.200\n that it takes a while to a person to understand\n\n1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:51.080\n that they are not attentive anymore.\n\n1:06:51.080 --> 1:06:52.160\n And we know that there are people\n\n1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.520\n who really have strong capacity to hold attention.\n\n1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:57.080\n There are other end of the spectrum people with ADD\n\n1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:58.800\n and other issues that they have problem\n\n1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:00.760\n to regulate their attention.\n\n1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:03.520\n Imagine to yourself that you have like a cognitive aid\n\n1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:06.280\n that just alerts you based on your gaze,\n\n1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:09.280\n that your attention is now not on what you are doing.\n\n1:07:09.280 --> 1:07:10.560\n And instead of writing a paper,\n\n1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:12.760\n you're now dreaming of what you're gonna do in the evening.\n\n1:07:12.760 --> 1:07:16.360\n So even this kind of simple measurement things,\n\n1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:17.840\n how they can change us.\n\n1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:22.400\n And I see it even in simple ways with myself.\n\n1:07:22.400 --> 1:07:26.480\n I have my zone app that I got in MIT gym.\n\n1:07:26.480 --> 1:07:28.800\n It kind of records, you know, how much did you run\n\n1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:29.800\n and you have some points\n\n1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:32.880\n and you can get some status, whatever.\n\n1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:35.840\n Like, I said, what is this ridiculous thing?\n\n1:07:35.840 --> 1:07:38.800\n Who would ever care about some status in some app?\n\n1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:39.640\n Guess what?\n\n1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:41.560\n So to maintain the status,\n\n1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:44.640\n you have to do set a number of points every month.\n\n1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:48.040\n And not only is that I do it every single month\n\n1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:50.560\n for the last 18 months,\n\n1:07:50.560 --> 1:07:54.160\n it went to the point that I was injured.\n\n1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:56.160\n And when I could run again,\n\n1:07:58.120 --> 1:08:02.560\n in two days, I did like some humongous amount of running\n\n1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:04.080\n just to complete the points.\n\n1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:05.920\n It was like really not safe.\n\n1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:08.440\n It was like, I'm not gonna lose my status\n\n1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:10.240\n because I want to get there.\n\n1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:13.320\n So you can already see that this direct measurement\n\n1:08:13.320 --> 1:08:15.160\n and the feedback is, you know,\n\n1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:16.320\n we're looking at video games\n\n1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:18.720\n and see why, you know, the addiction aspect of it,\n\n1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:21.200\n but you can imagine that the same idea can be expanded\n\n1:08:21.200 --> 1:08:23.640\n to many other areas of our life.\n\n1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.960\n When we really can get feedback\n\n1:08:25.960 --> 1:08:28.480\n and imagine in your case in relations,\n\n1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:31.240\n when we are doing keyword matching,\n\n1:08:31.240 --> 1:08:36.120\n imagine that the person who is generating the keywords,\n\n1:08:36.120 --> 1:08:37.720\n that person gets direct feedback\n\n1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:39.560\n before the whole thing explodes.\n\n1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:42.000\n Is it maybe at this happy point,\n\n1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000\n we are going in the wrong direction.\n\n1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.040\n Maybe it will be really a behavior modifying moment.\n\n1:08:48.040 --> 1:08:51.360\n So yeah, it's a relationship management too.\n\n1:08:51.360 --> 1:08:54.200\n So yeah, that's a fascinating whole area\n\n1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:56.120\n of psychology actually as well,\n\n1:08:56.120 --> 1:08:58.240\n of seeing how our behavior has changed\n\n1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:01.840\n with basically all human relations now have\n\n1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:06.200\n other nonhuman entities helping us out.\n\n1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:09.440\n So you teach a large,\n\n1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:12.600\n a huge machine learning course here at MIT.\n\n1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.360\n I can ask you a million questions,\n\n1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:17.560\n but you've seen a lot of students.\n\n1:09:17.560 --> 1:09:20.920\n What ideas do students struggle with the most\n\n1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:23.920\n as they first enter this world of machine learning?\n\n1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:26.520\n Actually, this year was the first time\n\n1:09:26.520 --> 1:09:28.480\n I started teaching a small machine learning class.\n\n1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:31.160\n And it came as a result of what I saw\n\n1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:34.640\n in my big machine learning class that Tomi Yakel and I built\n\n1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:36.640\n maybe six years ago.\n\n1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:40.360\n What we've seen that as this area become more\n\n1:09:40.360 --> 1:09:43.440\n and more popular, more and more people at MIT\n\n1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:45.360\n want to take this class.\n\n1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.320\n And while we designed it for computer science majors,\n\n1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:50.760\n there were a lot of people who really are interested\n\n1:09:50.760 --> 1:09:52.600\n to learn it, but unfortunately,\n\n1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:55.720\n their background was not enabling them\n\n1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:57.200\n to do well in the class.\n\n1:09:57.200 --> 1:09:59.360\n And many of them associated machine learning\n\n1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:01.360\n with the word struggle and failure,\n\n1:10:02.480 --> 1:10:04.640\n primarily for non majors.\n\n1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:06.840\n And that's why we actually started a new class\n\n1:10:06.840 --> 1:10:10.800\n which we call machine learning from algorithms to modeling,\n\n1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:15.000\n which emphasizes more the modeling aspects of it\n\n1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:20.000\n and focuses on, it has majors and non majors.\n\n1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:23.480\n So we kind of try to extract the relevant parts\n\n1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.560\n and make it more accessible,\n\n1:10:25.560 --> 1:10:27.800\n because the fact that we're teaching 20 classifiers\n\n1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:29.240\n in standard machine learning class,\n\n1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:32.200\n it's really a big question to really need it.\n\n1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.520\n But it was interesting to see this\n\n1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:36.480\n from first generation of students,\n\n1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:39.080\n when they came back from their internships\n\n1:10:39.080 --> 1:10:42.320\n and from their jobs,\n\n1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:45.560\n what different and exciting things they can do.\n\n1:10:45.560 --> 1:10:47.600\n I would never think that you can even apply\n\n1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:50.800\n machine learning to, some of them are like matching,\n\n1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:53.480\n the relations and other things like variety.\n\n1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:56.080\n Everything is amenable as the machine learning.\n\n1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:58.320\n That actually brings up an interesting point\n\n1:10:58.320 --> 1:11:00.680\n of computer science in general.\n\n1:11:00.680 --> 1:11:03.520\n It almost seems, maybe I'm crazy,\n\n1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:06.520\n but it almost seems like everybody needs to learn\n\n1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:08.160\n how to program these days.\n\n1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.400\n If you're 20 years old, or if you're starting school,\n\n1:11:11.400 --> 1:11:14.200\n even if you're an English major,\n\n1:11:14.200 --> 1:11:19.200\n it seems like programming unlocks so much possibility\n\n1:11:20.480 --> 1:11:21.880\n in this world.\n\n1:11:21.880 --> 1:11:25.000\n So when you interacted with those non majors,\n\n1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:30.000\n is there skills that they were simply lacking at the time\n\n1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:33.000\n that you wish they had and that they learned\n\n1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:34.680\n in high school and so on?\n\n1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:37.520\n Like how should education change\n\n1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:41.320\n in this computerized world that we live in?\n\n1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:44.320\n I think because I knew that there is a Python component\n\n1:11:44.320 --> 1:11:47.000\n in the class, their Python skills were okay\n\n1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.160\n and the class isn't really heavy on programming.\n\n1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:52.400\n They primarily kind of add parts to the programs.\n\n1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:55.440\n I think it was more of the mathematical barriers\n\n1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:58.200\n and the class, again, with the design on the majors\n\n1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:01.200\n was using the notation, like big O for complexity\n\n1:12:01.200 --> 1:12:04.520\n and others, people who come from different backgrounds\n\n1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:05.800\n just don't have it in the lexical,\n\n1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:09.120\n so necessarily very challenging notion,\n\n1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:11.480\n but they were just not aware.\n\n1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:16.240\n So I think that kind of linear algebra and probability,\n\n1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:19.120\n the basics, the calculus, multivariate calculus,\n\n1:12:19.120 --> 1:12:20.840\n things that can help.\n\n1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:23.520\n What advice would you give to students\n\n1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:25.280\n interested in machine learning,\n\n1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:29.240\n interested, you've talked about detecting,\n\n1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:31.360\n curing cancer, drug design,\n\n1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:34.520\n if they want to get into that field, what should they do?\n\n1:12:36.320 --> 1:12:39.040\n Get into it and succeed as researchers\n\n1:12:39.040 --> 1:12:42.080\n and entrepreneurs.\n\n1:12:43.320 --> 1:12:45.240\n The first good piece of news is that right now\n\n1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:47.400\n there are lots of resources\n\n1:12:47.400 --> 1:12:50.160\n that are created at different levels\n\n1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:54.800\n and you can find online in your school classes\n\n1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:57.560\n which are more mathematical, more applied and so on.\n\n1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:01.320\n So you can find a kind of a preacher\n\n1:13:01.320 --> 1:13:02.760\n which preaches in your own language\n\n1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:04.520\n where you can enter the field\n\n1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.720\n and you can make many different types of contribution\n\n1:13:06.720 --> 1:13:09.640\n depending of what is your strengths.\n\n1:13:10.760 --> 1:13:13.720\n And the second point, I think it's really important\n\n1:13:13.720 --> 1:13:18.160\n to find some area which you really care about\n\n1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:20.240\n and it can motivate your learning\n\n1:13:20.240 --> 1:13:22.640\n and it can be for somebody curing cancer\n\n1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:25.360\n or doing self driving cars or whatever,\n\n1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:29.680\n but to find an area where there is data\n\n1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:31.320\n where you believe there are strong patterns\n\n1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:33.600\n and we should be doing it and we're still not doing it\n\n1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:35.280\n or you can do it better\n\n1:13:35.280 --> 1:13:39.680\n and just start there and see where it can bring you.\n\n1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:45.600\n So you've been very successful in many directions in life,\n\n1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:48.840\n but you also mentioned Flowers of Argonon.\n\n1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:53.840\n And I think I've read or listened to you mention somewhere\n\n1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:55.360\n that researchers often get lost\n\n1:13:55.360 --> 1:13:56.720\n in the details of their work.\n\n1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:00.240\n This is per our original discussion with cancer and so on\n\n1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:02.200\n and don't look at the bigger picture,\n\n1:14:02.200 --> 1:14:05.320\n bigger questions of meaning and so on.\n\n1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:07.440\n So let me ask you the impossible question\n\n1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:11.560\n of what's the meaning of this thing,\n\n1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:16.560\n of life, of your life, of research.\n\n1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:21.440\n Why do you think we descendant of great apes\n\n1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:24.480\n are here on this spinning ball?\n\n1:14:26.800 --> 1:14:30.320\n You know, I don't think that I have really a global answer.\n\n1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:32.800\n You know, maybe that's why I didn't go to humanities\n\n1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:36.480\n and I didn't take humanities classes in my undergrad.\n\n1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:43.560\n But the way I'm thinking about it,\n\n1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:48.200\n each one of us inside of them have their own set of,\n\n1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:51.120\n you know, things that we believe are important.\n\n1:14:51.120 --> 1:14:53.360\n And it just happens that we are busy\n\n1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:56.240\n with achieving various goals, busy listening to others\n\n1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:00.960\n and to kind of try to conform and to be part of the crowd,\n\n1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:03.680\n that we don't listen to that part.\n\n1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:09.600\n And, you know, we all should find some time to understand\n\n1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.840\n what is our own individual missions.\n\n1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:14.080\n And we may have very different missions\n\n1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:18.200\n and to make sure that while we are running 10,000 things,\n\n1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:21.920\n we are not, you know, missing out\n\n1:15:21.920 --> 1:15:26.800\n and we're putting all the resources to satisfy\n\n1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:28.440\n our own mission.\n\n1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:32.400\n And if I look over my time, when I was younger,\n\n1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:35.000\n most of these missions, you know,\n\n1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.600\n I was primarily driven by the external stimulus,\n\n1:15:38.600 --> 1:15:41.520\n you know, to achieve this or to be that.\n\n1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:46.520\n And now a lot of what I do is driven by really thinking\n\n1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:51.360\n what is important for me to achieve independently\n\n1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:55.160\n of the external recognition.\n\n1:15:55.160 --> 1:16:00.080\n And, you know, I don't mind to be viewed in certain ways.\n\n1:16:01.400 --> 1:16:05.760\n The most important thing for me is to be true to myself,\n\n1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:07.520\n to what I think is right.\n\n1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:08.680\n How long did it take?\n\n1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:13.240\n How hard was it to find the you that you have to be true to?\n\n1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:15.520\n So it takes time.\n\n1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:17.760\n And even now, sometimes, you know,\n\n1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:20.880\n the vanity and the triviality can take, you know.\n\n1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:22.560\n At MIT.\n\n1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:25.080\n Yeah, it can everywhere, you know,\n\n1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:26.960\n it's just the vanity at MIT is different,\n\n1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:28.160\n the vanity in different places,\n\n1:16:28.160 --> 1:16:30.920\n but we all have our piece of vanity.\n\n1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:35.920\n But I think actually for me, many times the place\n\n1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:43.720\n to get back to it is, you know, when I'm alone\n\n1:16:43.800 --> 1:16:45.800\n and also when I read.\n\n1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.760\n And I think by selecting the right books,\n\n1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:52.760\n you can get the right questions and learn from what you read.\n\n1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:58.080\n So, but again, it's not perfect.\n\n1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:02.040\n Like vanity sometimes dominates.\n\n1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:04.800\n Well, that's a beautiful way to end.\n\n1:17:04.800 --> 1:17:06.400\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n1:17:06.400 --> 1:17:07.240\n Thank you.\n\n1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:08.080\n That was fun.\n\n1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:28.080\n That was fun.\n\n"
