challenging the norms\n\n00:06.920 --> 00:09.840\n of modern day social and political discourse.\n\n00:09.840 --> 00:11.680\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:11.680 --> 00:14.120\n NetSuite

As a side note, let me say that I will continue\n\n00:37.440 --> 00:39.760\n talking to scientists, engineers, historians,\n\n00:39.760 --> 00:41.720\n mathematicians, and so on.\n\n00:41.720 --> 00:44.280\n But I will also talk to the people\n\n00:44.280 --> 00:47.160\n who Jack Kerouac called the mad ones\n\n00:47.160 --> 00:48.920\n in his book, On The Road.\n\n00:48.920 --> 00:51.280\n That is one of my favorite books.\n\n00:51.280 --> 00:55.040\n He wrote, the only people for me are the mad ones.\n\n00:55.040 --> 00:56.920\n The ones who are mad to live,\n\n00:56.920 --> 00:59.640\n mad to talk, mad to be saved,\n\n00:59.640 --> 01:02.480\n desirous of everything at the same time.\n\n01:02.480 --> 01:05.560\n The ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing,\n\n01:05.560 --> 01:10.560\n but burn, burn, like fabulous yellow Roman candles\n\n01:10.560 --> 01:13.640\n exploding like spiders across the stars.\n\n01:13.640 --> 01:17.000\n And in the middle, you see the blue center light pop\n\n01:17.000 --> 01:19.960\n and everybody goes, ah.\n\n01:19.960 --> 01:23.600\n Some of these conversations will be a bit of a gamble\n\n01:23.600 --> 01:26.520\n in that I have no idea how they will turn out.\n\n01:26.520 --> 01:29.440\n But I'm willing to risk it for a chance\n\n01:29.440 --> 01:31.080\n at a bit of an adventure.\n\n01:31.080 --> 01:34.760\n And I'm happy and honored that Tim, this time,\n\n01:34.760 --> 01:36.960\n wanted to take a chance as well.\n\n01:36.960 --> 01:39.200\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on

good way to summarize the essence of a human being.\n\n01:58.840 --> 02:01.520\n I would like it to say, this has not been paid for.\n\n02:01.520 --> 02:02.480\n Yeah.\n\n02:02.480 --> 02:07.480\n And I want my living relatives to struggle to pay for it.\n\n02:08.320 --> 02:11.320\n And I think I would like them to be hounded every day.\n\n02:11.320 --> 02:12.600\n I would like people to call and go, listen,\n\n02:12.600 --> 02:14.680\n we don't wanna ever excavate a body,\n\n02:14.680 --> 02:18.800\n but we will because this has not been paid for.\n\n02:18.800 --> 02:22.520\n I love the idea of leaving the, like debt,\n\n02:22.520 --> 02:24.720\n leaving the world in lots of debt\n\n02:24.720 --> 02:26.880\n that other people have to deal with.\n\n02:26.880 --> 02:29.080\n And I know people that have done that.\n\n02:29.080 --> 02:30.480\n I know people that have been in families\n\n02:30.480 --> 02:34.000\n where that's happened, where someone has to sit\n\n02:34.000 --> 02:36.720\n and just curse the sky\n\n02:36.720 --> 02:38.960\n because they don't have a physical person anymore\n\n02:38.960 --> 02:42.280\n to be angry at, but they still have to deal\n\n02:42.280 --> 02:44.080\n with the decisions that person made.\n\n02:44.080 --> 02:45.320\n And that's deeply tragic,\n\n02:45.320 --> 02:47.040\n but that's always struck me as very funny.\n\n02:47.040 --> 02:49.400\n Well, it's a kind of immortality, the debt.\n\n02:49.400 --> 02:52.080\n Because if the debt lasts for a long time,\n\n02:52.080 --> 02:53.960\n the anger lasts for a long time.\n\n02:53.960 --> 02:57.000\n And then you're now immortal in the minds of many.\n\n02:57.000 --> 02:59.360\n You arouse emotion in the minds of many.\n\n02:59.360 --> 03:01.840\n My mother's best friend in the town I grew up in,\n\n03:01.840 --> 03:06.840\n her husband shot himself in the driveway.\n\n03:07.080 --> 03:10.680\n And my mother's friend never got a chance to just grieve\n\n03:10.680 --> 03:12.600\n because he owed so much money.\n\n03:12.600 --> 03:15.400\n She would come over and go, I hate him.\n\n03:15.400 --> 03:17.440\n I fucking hate him.\n\n03:17.440 --> 03:18.760\n And it was just such an interesting thing\n\n03:18.760 --> 03:21.480\n to see somebody who, and her kids ended up getting angry\n\n03:21.480 --> 03:24.360\n at her for that because they didn't understand\n\n03:24.360 --> 03:28.120\n why she would hate a guy who was clearly suffering.\n\n03:28.120 --> 03:30.280\n But she goes, he took the selfish way out.\n\n03:30.280 --> 03:31.720\n He fucked us.\n\n03:31.720 --> 03:34.880\n And it was always interesting for me to just remember\n\n03:34.880 --> 03:39.360\n that you can leave earth and still be a problem.\n\n03:39.360 --> 03:43.360\n That's kind of a special person.\n\n03:43.360 --> 03:45.520\n So that's, I think, what I'd like my tombstone to read.\n\n03:45.520 --> 03:48.520\n Yeah, there's a show called Louis with Louis C.K.\n\n03:48.520 --> 03:49.520\n I don't know if you watched it.\n\n03:49.520 --> 03:50.480\n I'm aware of it.\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:53.480\n There's this moment, I think, where an old guy's talking\n\n03:53.480 --> 03:56.880\n to Louis about the best part about love\n\n03:56.880 --> 03:58.480\n is after you break up.\n\n03:58.480 --> 04:03.480\n And it's remembering the good times and feeling that loss,\n\n04:05.680 --> 04:07.160\n the pain of that loss.\n\n04:07.160 --> 04:09.400\n The worst part about love is when you no longer\n\n04:09.400 --> 04:10.480\n feel that pain.\n\n04:10.480 --> 04:15.480\n So the pain of losing somebody lasts longer,\n\n04:15.680 --> 04:18.600\n is more intense and lasts longer than the actual love.\n\n04:18.600 --> 04:23.480\n So his argument was like the pain is what love really is.\n\n04:23.480 --> 04:24.320\n Wow.\n\n04:24.320 --> 04:26.080\n In the same way that anger,\n\n04:26.080 --> 04:30.600\n your tombstone would arouse will last longer.\n\n04:30.600 --> 04:33.440\n And that's deeply like a human thing.\n\n04:33.440 --> 04:36.320\n Like why do we attach happiness\n\n04:36.320 --> 04:38.560\n to the way we should remember others?\n\n04:38.560 --> 04:40.560\n It could be just anger.\n\n04:40.560 --> 04:43.240\n I know so many people who will have\n\n04:43.240 --> 04:45.840\n deeply complicated feelings when...\n\n04:45.840 --> 04:49.200\n I did drugs for many years and I spent time\n\n04:49.200 --> 04:50.680\n with some wild people.\n\n04:50.680 --> 04:53.240\n And their parents were also wild people.\n\n04:53.240 --> 04:58.120\n And some of their parents have done crazy things to them.\n\n04:58.120 --> 05:03.120\n And have created situations that were not productive\n\n05:04.640 --> 05:06.560\n for child rearing.\n\n05:06.560 --> 05:09.120\n And so I know that when those people die,\n\n05:09.120 --> 05:11.520\n it's going to be a very mixed bag.\n\n05:11.520 --> 05:13.640\n Like there's going to be a lot of complex emotions.\n\n05:13.640 --> 05:16.600\n Like, hey, we loved that guy.\n\n05:16.600 --> 05:21.320\n But also when we look back, he was a horrible father,\n\n05:21.320 --> 05:24.200\n a horrible husband, but he was fun.\n\n05:25.240 --> 05:27.480\n And we don't put enough stock in that,\n\n05:27.480 --> 05:29.360\n but that will be a push and pull.\n\n05:29.360 --> 05:30.960\n And I'll be the one kind of bringing up like,\n\n05:30.960 --> 05:33.120\n hey, he was a lot of fun.\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:33.960\n He was a lot.\n\n05:33.960 --> 05:36.440\n Remember when he stuck us,\n\n05:36.440 --> 05:39.200\n one of the things this particular person I'm talking about,\n\n05:39.200 --> 05:41.720\n we were at a bar and me and my friend were there,\n\n05:41.720 --> 05:42.560\n we're having dinner.\n\n05:42.560 --> 05:45.600\n And his father, who was an alcoholic,\n\n05:45.600 --> 05:49.360\n a guy that would go out every night and didn't work,\n\n05:49.360 --> 05:52.520\n refused to work, would lie and say he was going to work\n\n05:52.520 --> 05:53.480\n and then go to a bar.\n\n05:53.480 --> 05:55.760\n I mean, just a fun person.\n\n05:55.760 --> 06:00.120\n And we were sitting at this bar restaurant\n\n06:00.120 --> 06:02.240\n and the bartender, we see his father walk up\n\n06:02.240 --> 06:06.120\n to the bartender and say, point at us, point at our table\n\n06:06.120 --> 06:07.560\n and go and put the thumbs up.\n\n06:07.560 --> 06:08.960\n And the bartender nodded.\n\n06:08.960 --> 06:10.840\n And then the father walked over to our table and he said,\n\n06:10.840 --> 06:13.360\n listen, I just want to let you know I just bought you dinner.\n\n06:14.720 --> 06:17.320\n And I looked at his son and I said, he's a pretty good guy.\n\n06:17.320 --> 06:20.360\n And then he climbed over the little fence down to the water\n\n06:20.360 --> 06:21.200\n and got in his little boat.\n\n06:21.200 --> 06:23.600\n It was a little cigarette boat and he just drove away.\n\n06:23.600 --> 06:26.400\n And then about an hour later, we went and we said,\n\n06:26.400 --> 06:28.840\n I think that guy took care of the bill.\n\n06:28.840 --> 06:30.480\n But she said, well, go talk to the bartender.\n\n06:30.480 --> 06:32.840\n So we talked to the bartender and he goes,\n\n06:32.840 --> 06:36.400\n he handed us a bill and the bill was for like $1,000.\n\n06:36.400 --> 06:38.320\n And we said, wait a minute, what the hell's going on?\n\n06:38.320 --> 06:40.680\n And he goes, the guy that left an hour ago said,\n\n06:40.680 --> 06:42.040\n you were going to take care of his bill.\n\n06:42.040 --> 06:44.240\n He's been drinking here all week.\n\n06:44.240 --> 06:46.000\n And we go, what are you talking about?\n\n06:46.000 --> 06:47.840\n And he goes, remember, he pointed at you.\n\n06:47.840 --> 06:50.520\n He put the thumbs up and you guys waved.\n\n06:50.520 --> 06:52.240\n You remember that?\n\n06:52.240 --> 06:53.680\n And the guy go, and we went, yeah.\n\n06:53.680 --> 06:55.680\n And I just looked at my friends, my friend and I went,\n\n06:55.680 --> 06:57.280\n you know, your dad is just,\n\n06:57.280 --> 07:00.040\n we're going to remember him for all kinds of reasons.\n\n07:00.040 --> 07:01.480\n But to you, he was fun.\n\n07:01.480 --> 07:02.320\n He was a lot of fun.\n\n07:02.320 --> 07:04.480\n He wasn't my dad, but I spent a lot of time with him.\n\n07:04.480 --> 07:06.440\n I was in two boating accidents with him.\n\n07:07.560 --> 07:08.880\n You know, two boating accidents.\n\n07:08.880 --> 07:10.080\n Alcohol involved, drugs involved.\n\n07:10.080 --> 07:11.880\n Yes, he was, usually alcohol was involved\n\n07:11.880 --> 07:15.840\n when he left his house and when he was at home as well.\n\n07:15.840 --> 07:17.240\n But I was in two boating accidents.\n\n07:17.240 --> 07:19.880\n And do you know how fun someone has to be\n\n07:19.880 --> 07:21.760\n to get in a second boating accident?\n\n07:22.720 --> 07:25.840\n Do you know what a good time someone has to be\n\n07:25.840 --> 07:27.680\n to get in a boat with them\n\n07:27.680 --> 07:30.680\n after you've already gotten in one wreck?\n\n07:30.680 --> 07:31.680\n Never get fooled again.\n\n07:31.680 --> 07:32.520\n What was that line?\n\n07:32.520 --> 07:34.400\n George Bush, never get fooled again.\n\n07:34.400 --> 07:35.360\n Right.\n\n07:35.360 --> 07:37.320\n Yeah, so if you're getting fooled again,\n\n07:37.320 --> 07:38.200\n you know, there's a reason for it,\n\n07:38.200 --> 07:39.560\n but he was a fun guy.\n\n07:39.560 --> 07:40.520\n He did have a death wish.\n\n07:40.520 --> 07:42.200\n The second boating accident, he grabbed me\n\n07:42.200 --> 07:43.480\n and said, you can't hang out with me anymore.\n\n07:43.480 --> 07:44.320\n And I said, why?\n\n07:44.320 --> 07:45.800\n He goes, I'm trying to kill myself.\n\n07:45.800 --> 07:47.000\n And I was like, oh.\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:49.760\n And then I understood that like all of the fun\n\n07:49.760 --> 07:52.960\n under the fun lived a very destructive person\n\n07:52.960 --> 07:56.380\n who not only was destructive, but wanted to die.\n\n07:57.440 --> 07:59.920\n So speaking of fun people that want to die,\n\n07:59.920 --> 08:02.680\n I don't know if you're, we can go Hunter S. Thompson,\n\n08:02.680 --> 08:05.080\n but Charles Bukowski.\n\n08:05.080 --> 08:06.400\n I don't know if you're aware of the guy.\n\n08:06.400 --> 08:07.320\n I'm aware of him, sure.\n\n08:07.320 --> 08:08.880\n I've read some of his stuff.\n\n08:08.880 --> 08:10.840\n So his tombstone says,\n\n08:10.840 --> 08:12.480\n I just want to ask you a question about it.\n\n08:12.480 --> 08:15.420\n His tombstone says, don't try.\n\n08:15.420 --> 08:16.620\n Interesting.\n\n08:16.620 --> 08:18.280\n What do you think about that advice\n\n08:18.280 --> 08:19.960\n as a way to approach life?\n\n08:19.960 --> 08:23.200\n I think for many people, it's a good advice\n\n08:24.080 --> 08:26.960\n because the people that are going to try will do anyway.\n\n08:26.960 --> 08:28.280\n And the people that need to be told,\n\n08:28.280 --> 08:30.240\n there's a whole cottage industry now\n\n08:30.240 --> 08:35.080\n of motivational speakers and life coaches and gurus\n\n08:35.080 --> 08:39.880\n that tell people that they all have to own their own business\n\n08:39.880 --> 08:42.880\n and be their own boss and be a disruptor\n\n08:42.880 --> 08:45.160\n and get into industries.\n\n08:45.160 --> 08:47.440\n That's incredibly unrealistic for most people.\n\n08:47.440 --> 08:50.140\n Most people are not suited for that.\n\n08:50.140 --> 08:52.680\n And the Gary Vees of the world that tell everybody\n\n08:52.680 --> 08:54.100\n that they should just hustle and grind\n\n08:54.100 --> 08:54.940\n and hustle and grind.\n\n08:54.940 --> 08:56.060\n They're very light on the specifics\n\n08:56.060 --> 08:58.120\n of what they should actually do.\n\n08:58.120 --> 08:59.720\n Yeah, I think a lot of people,\n\n08:59.720 --> 09:02.080\n that's not horrible advice to give to a lot of people.\n\n09:02.080 --> 09:05.160\n I think my generation got horrible advice\n\n09:05.160 --> 09:07.600\n from our parents, from our teachers.\n\n09:07.600 --> 09:11.360\n And that advice was follow your dreams and nobody,\n\n09:11.360 --> 09:12.200\n and that was it, by the way.\n\n09:12.200 --> 09:14.480\n There was no like, what are your dreams?\n\n09:14.480 --> 09:15.620\n Are they realistic?\n\n09:15.620 --> 09:17.240\n What happens when they don't work out?\n\n09:17.240 --> 09:18.740\n Will your dreams make you happy?\n\n09:18.740 --> 09:20.820\n Are your dreams real?\n\n09:20.820 --> 09:22.600\n Do they exist on earth?\n\n09:22.600 --> 09:25.680\n Can you follow, anybody follow your dreams?\n\n09:25.680 --> 09:26.800\n You can be anything you want to be.\n\n09:26.800 --> 09:29.080\n Horrible advice, horrible advice.\n\n09:29.080 --> 09:31.640\n Worst advice you could ever give a generation of people.\n\n09:31.640 --> 09:32.760\n Really, truly.\n\n09:32.760 --> 09:35.000\n I mean, think about it.\n\n09:35.000 --> 09:37.160\n If you were talking to somebody\n\n09:37.160 --> 09:39.200\n and you were trying to make them succeed,\n\n09:39.200 --> 09:43.560\n are there any two worse pieces of advice to give them\n\n09:43.560 --> 09:46.160\n than follow your dreams\n\n09:46.160 --> 09:48.640\n and you can be anything you want to be?\n\n09:48.640 --> 09:51.840\n Those to me are the two most destructive pieces\n\n09:51.840 --> 09:53.160\n of information I've ever heard.\n\n09:53.160 --> 09:54.800\n So let me push back because.\n\n09:54.800 --> 09:55.640\n Okay, that's fair.\n\n09:55.640 --> 09:57.840\n This is. Many people do.\n\n09:57.840 --> 10:01.840\n So yeah, this is like a rigorous journalistic interview.\n\n10:01.840 --> 10:04.040\n Larry King, by the way, passed away today.\n\n10:04.040 --> 10:05.600\n So I'm taking over the.\n\n10:05.600 --> 10:06.440\n It's very sad.\n\n10:06.440 --> 10:07.260\n I'm carrying the.\n\n10:07.260 --> 10:08.100\n It's very sad.\n\n10:08.100 --> 10:09.680\n RIP King.\n\n10:09.680 --> 10:11.200\n Yeah, what was I even gonna say?\n\n10:11.200 --> 10:14.640\n Oh, let me push back on the follow your dream thing\n\n10:14.640 --> 10:18.260\n is I come from an immigrant family\n\n10:18.260 --> 10:23.160\n where I was always working extremely hard at stuff,\n\n10:23.160 --> 10:24.560\n like in a stupid way.\n\n10:24.560 --> 10:26.800\n I would, I love, there's something about me\n\n10:26.800 --> 10:28.600\n that loves hitting my head against the wall\n\n10:28.600 --> 10:31.440\n over and over and over until either my head breaks\n\n10:31.440 --> 10:32.360\n or the wall breaks.\n\n10:32.360 --> 10:34.680\n Just like, I love that dedication\n\n10:34.680 --> 10:36.200\n for no purpose whatsoever.\n\n10:36.200 --> 10:39.040\n It's like the mouse that's stuck in a cage or whatever.\n\n10:39.040 --> 10:42.320\n And no, and everybody always told me,\n\n10:42.320 --> 10:45.020\n my family, the people around me,\n\n10:45.020 --> 10:48.880\n the sort of the epitome of what I could achieve\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:52.000\n is to be kind of a stable job.\n\n10:52.000 --> 10:54.720\n You know, the old like lawyer doctor,\n\n10:54.720 --> 10:57.720\n in my case, it's like scientists and so on.\n\n10:57.720 --> 11:00.520\n But I had these dreams at this fire, you know,\n\n11:00.520 --> 11:03.400\n about love robots.\n\n11:03.400 --> 11:06.700\n And that nobody ever gave me permission\n\n11:06.700 --> 11:08.360\n to pursue those dreams.\n\n11:08.360 --> 11:10.240\n I know you're supposed to grab it yourself.\n\n11:10.240 --> 11:12.000\n Nobody's supposed to give you permission,\n\n11:12.000 --> 11:16.760\n but there's something about just people saying, you know,\n\n11:16.760 --> 11:18.720\n fuck what everyone else thinks,\n\n11:18.720 --> 11:20.520\n like giving you permission, a parent\n\n11:20.520 --> 11:23.480\n or somebody like that saying, do your own thing.\n\n11:23.480 --> 11:25.480\n Go become an actor, go become like,\n\n11:25.480 --> 11:27.120\n do the crazy thing you're not supposed to do,\n\n11:27.120 --> 11:30.820\n an artist, go build a company, quit school,\n\n11:30.820 --> 11:31.960\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n11:31.960 --> 11:33.200\n Yes, sure.\n\n11:33.200 --> 11:35.140\n That's the push back against the,\n\n11:36.040 --> 11:38.640\n follow your dreams as bad advice.\n\n11:38.640 --> 11:40.540\n In mass, if you were to look at,\n\n11:40.540 --> 11:43.160\n in mass, if you were to look at statistically\n\n11:43.160 --> 11:45.360\n how few people that works out for,\n\n11:45.360 --> 11:46.920\n I'm just, no, but let's be very honest.\n\n11:46.920 --> 11:47.760\n That's very true.\n\n11:47.760 --> 11:48.580\n Be very honest.\n\n11:48.580 --> 11:50.520\n So I mean like, yeah, if you're gonna go be an,\n\n11:50.520 --> 11:52.920\n hey, I was broke for 10 years before I became a,\n\n11:52.920 --> 11:54.600\n before I was making money as a comedian.\n\n11:54.600 --> 11:55.840\n I get it.\n\n11:55.840 --> 11:57.360\n I didn't need Gary Vaynerchuk\n\n11:57.360 --> 11:59.720\n to tell me to follow my thing, right?\n\n11:59.720 --> 12:00.560\n And here's the other thing.\n\n12:00.560 --> 12:02.400\n I was kind of funny and like,\n\n12:02.400 --> 12:06.640\n I was kind of, a lot of things were in my favor\n\n12:06.640 --> 12:07.720\n of being a comedian, right?\n\n12:07.720 --> 12:09.080\n I had this kind of crazy fucked up life.\n\n12:09.080 --> 12:10.500\n I had a lot of stories.\n\n12:10.500 --> 12:12.920\n I had exhausted, I was willing to fail.\n\n12:12.920 --> 12:14.680\n I had failed before.\n\n12:14.680 --> 12:15.540\n I was broke.\n\n12:15.540 --> 12:16.960\n I didn't care about being broke.\n\n12:16.960 --> 12:18.700\n I knew how to be broke.\n\n12:18.700 --> 12:21.360\n I had, I was shameless to a degree.\n\n12:21.360 --> 12:23.560\n I was, I would get on a stage night after night\n\n12:23.560 --> 12:24.880\n and be laughed at.\n\n12:24.880 --> 12:28.040\n I would, I had a high threshold for being embarrassed.\n\n12:28.040 --> 12:29.880\n I had a high threshold for people thinking\n\n12:29.880 --> 12:31.840\n that I was a scumbag, right?\n\n12:31.840 --> 12:33.640\n And showing up at family parties and being like,\n\n12:33.640 --> 12:35.320\n yeah, I still really don't have a job.\n\n12:35.320 --> 12:38.600\n And I'm just, I work at comedy clubs kind of,\n\n12:38.600 --> 12:40.000\n and I get booked when I can.\n\n12:41.000 --> 12:44.520\n And I was, you know, suited for it.\n\n12:44.520 --> 12:48.040\n There's this idea that people can just roam\n\n12:48.040 --> 12:53.040\n around the world injecting themselves into other things\n\n12:53.680 --> 12:56.400\n they have no aptitude for at all.\n\n12:56.400 --> 12:58.240\n And will that to happen?\n\n12:58.240 --> 13:01.080\n A small percentage of people might be able to do that,\n\n13:01.080 --> 13:04.140\n but the vast majority of people have something\n\n13:04.140 --> 13:06.760\n they might key into that they're meant to do.\n\n13:06.760 --> 13:09.280\n Like you loved robots, you love technology,\n\n13:09.280 --> 13:12.800\n and you found a place in that world where you thrive.\n\n13:12.800 --> 13:16.140\n But I think many people, a lot of people love robots, right?\n\n13:16.140 --> 13:18.440\n So a lot of people think everything you do is interesting.\n\n13:18.440 --> 13:20.160\n I think your shit is fascinating.\n\n13:20.160 --> 13:23.600\n I watch you or podcasts, and I think it's very interesting.\n\n13:23.600 --> 13:26.240\n I have no place in your world.\n\n13:26.240 --> 13:27.320\n You know what I mean?\n\n13:27.320 --> 13:29.000\n I have no place in that world.\n\n13:29.000 --> 13:32.960\n I don't like remedial math.\n\n13:32.960 --> 13:35.400\n I don't like community college math.\n\n13:35.400 --> 13:37.280\n I think it's a waste of my time.\n\n13:37.280 --> 13:38.280\n What do you think about robot?\n\n13:38.280 --> 13:40.560\n Would you ever buy a robot for your home?\n\n13:40.560 --> 13:41.700\n Yes.\n\n13:41.700 --> 13:43.140\n What will it do?\n\n13:43.140 --> 13:44.880\n I'd be a companion, a friend.\n\n13:44.880 --> 13:47.040\n Oh yeah, I mean, I would like to start replacing friends\n\n13:47.040 --> 13:49.040\n and family with robots immediately.\n\n13:49.040 --> 13:51.280\n I mean, truly, truly.\n\n13:51.280 --> 13:52.620\n I mean, I'm not even kidding.\n\n13:52.620 --> 13:57.000\n Like I would like to have a Thanksgiving with four robots.\n\n13:57.000 --> 13:58.920\n I'm dead serious.\n\n13:58.920 --> 14:00.040\n Are they into QAnon?\n\n14:00.040 --> 14:05.040\n Like are the robots, when do the robots start going crazy?\n\n14:05.720 --> 14:08.160\n That's my question is like, how long do the robots\n\n14:08.160 --> 14:10.640\n live with me before they are also a problem\n\n14:10.640 --> 14:12.520\n and I got to replace them?\n\n14:12.520 --> 14:13.480\n You know what I mean?\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:15.440\n You're gonna indoctrinate the robot.\n\n14:15.440 --> 14:17.120\n The robot's gonna call me like my aunt does\n\n14:17.120 --> 14:19.520\n and talk about coronavirus for an hour every morning\n\n14:19.520 --> 14:22.940\n and tell me everyone in America who's died of coronavirus.\n\n14:22.940 --> 14:25.760\n One of the things I enjoy in life\n\n14:25.760 --> 14:29.200\n is how terrified people like you,\n\n14:29.200 --> 14:32.360\n I'm a huge fan by the way, get a robot.\n\n14:32.360 --> 14:34.920\n Well, I'm concerned about AI\n\n14:36.400 --> 14:39.640\n completely getting rid of the need for human beings\n\n14:39.640 --> 14:41.840\n because human beings, I mean, usually you go out\n\n14:41.840 --> 14:43.480\n in the street and you go,\n\n14:43.480 --> 14:46.880\n so few of these people are necessary, even now.\n\n14:46.880 --> 14:49.200\n Even now you look at people and you go,\n\n14:49.200 --> 14:51.040\n they're hanging on by a thread, right?\n\n14:51.040 --> 14:52.840\n And you can just imagine how many jobs\n\n14:52.840 --> 14:55.360\n are gonna get replaced, how many industries\n\n14:55.360 --> 14:58.640\n are going to be completely remade with AI\n\n14:58.640 --> 15:01.720\n and the pace of change worries me a little bit\n\n15:01.720 --> 15:04.320\n because we do a very bad job in this country\n\n15:04.320 --> 15:07.520\n of mitigation when we have problems.\n\n15:07.520 --> 15:08.600\n We don't do a great job.\n\n15:08.600 --> 15:11.160\n We did not great job with COVID, right?\n\n15:11.160 --> 15:12.000\n We don't do a good job.\n\n15:12.000 --> 15:13.920\n It's just something we don't do well.\n\n15:13.920 --> 15:15.800\n We're good in booms and busts.\n\n15:15.800 --> 15:17.080\n We're good when it's good.\n\n15:17.080 --> 15:19.240\n And we're actually, we kind of know how to kind of like,\n\n15:19.240 --> 15:20.580\n hey, we're bottomed out.\n\n15:20.580 --> 15:22.800\n We're like a gambling addict in this country.\n\n15:22.800 --> 15:24.800\n We like, we know what it feels like\n\n15:24.800 --> 15:26.680\n to be outside of an OTB at 9 a.m.\n\n15:26.680 --> 15:28.440\n drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes going,\n\n15:28.440 --> 15:29.800\n I'm gonna build it back.\n\n15:29.800 --> 15:31.560\n And we know what it's like to win,\n\n15:31.560 --> 15:35.660\n but anything in between, it seems not that great.\n\n15:35.660 --> 15:38.200\n So to me, it feels like are we gonna be able\n\n15:38.200 --> 15:41.680\n to like help people that are displaced\n\n15:41.680 --> 15:43.720\n and that have their jobs taken by,\n\n15:43.720 --> 15:47.160\n I mean, do you not fear sort of a world\n\n15:47.160 --> 15:50.800\n where you have a lot of artificial intelligence\n\n15:50.800 --> 15:53.280\n replacing workers and then what happens?\n\n15:53.280 --> 15:56.040\n There's a lot of fears around artificial intelligence.\n\n15:56.040 --> 15:59.440\n One of them is, yes, displacement of jobs, workers.\n\n15:59.440 --> 16:01.280\n That's technology in general.\n\n16:01.280 --> 16:06.280\n That's just any kind of new innovations displace jobs.\n\n16:06.280 --> 16:09.360\n I'm less worried about that.\n\n16:09.360 --> 16:10.840\n I'm more worried about other impacts\n\n16:10.840 --> 16:11.840\n of artificial intelligence.\n\n16:11.840 --> 16:13.720\n For example, the nature of our discourse,\n\n16:13.720 --> 16:15.880\n like social, the effects of algorithms\n\n16:15.880 --> 16:17.840\n on the way we communicate with each other,\n\n16:17.840 --> 16:19.680\n the spread of information,\n\n16:19.680 --> 16:21.280\n what that information looks like,\n\n16:21.280 --> 16:23.960\n the creation of silos, all that kind of stuff.\n\n16:23.960 --> 16:27.520\n I think that would just make worse\n\n16:27.520 --> 16:32.040\n the effects that the displacement of jobs has.\n\n16:32.040 --> 16:34.640\n I think ultimately, I have a hope\n\n16:34.640 --> 16:36.720\n that technology creates more opportunities\n\n16:36.720 --> 16:37.760\n than it destroys.\n\n16:37.760 --> 16:38.880\n I hope so too.\n\n16:38.880 --> 16:43.880\n So in that sense, AI to me is an exciting possibility,\n\n16:44.360 --> 16:48.880\n but the challenges this world presents\n\n16:48.880 --> 16:52.000\n will create divisions, will create chaos and so on.\n\n16:52.000 --> 16:55.120\n So I'm more focused on the way we deal\n\n16:55.120 --> 16:56.680\n as a society with that chaos,\n\n16:56.680 --> 16:57.960\n the way we talk to each other.\n\n16:57.960 --> 16:58.800\n That's huge.\n\n16:58.800 --> 17:00.680\n Creating the platform that's healthy for that.\n\n17:00.680 --> 17:03.480\n Now, as a comedian creator,\n\n17:03.480 --> 17:04.680\n whatever you want to call it,\n\n17:04.680 --> 17:07.760\n people that put out content,\n\n17:07.760 --> 17:10.280\n the gatekeepers are now algorithmic, right?\n\n17:10.280 --> 17:12.360\n So they are kind of almost AI ready.\n\n17:12.360 --> 17:16.680\n So if you are a person that puts out YouTube videos,\n\n17:16.680 --> 17:19.160\n podcasts, whatever you're doing,\n\n17:20.560 --> 17:24.360\n it used to be a guy in the back of the room with a cigar\n\n17:24.360 --> 17:27.400\n saying, I like you or get him out of here.\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:30.640\n Now, it's an algorithm you barely understand.\n\n17:30.640 --> 17:32.160\n I've talked to people at YouTube,\n\n17:32.160 --> 17:34.840\n but I don't know if they understand the algorithm.\n\n17:34.840 --> 17:35.680\n They don't.\n\n17:35.680 --> 17:36.520\n They don't.\n\n17:36.520 --> 17:37.360\n This is fascinating.\n\n17:37.360 --> 17:38.440\n Yeah, it's fascinating.\n\n17:38.440 --> 17:39.880\n Because I speak to people at YouTube and I go,\n\n17:39.880 --> 17:41.200\n hey, man, what's going on here?\n\n17:41.200 --> 17:43.560\n One of my episode titles of my podcast\n\n17:43.560 --> 17:45.720\n was called Knife Fight in Malibu.\n\n17:45.720 --> 17:47.720\n It was about real estate.\n\n17:47.720 --> 17:50.040\n And it was because a realtor in Malibu,\n\n17:50.040 --> 17:51.320\n I was trying to get a summer rental,\n\n17:51.320 --> 17:52.320\n which I can't really afford,\n\n17:52.320 --> 17:55.080\n but I don't think that's a huge problem.\n\n17:55.080 --> 17:56.720\n I follow my dreams.\n\n17:56.720 --> 17:59.080\n So I called a realtor and she said, listen,\n\n17:59.080 --> 18:01.000\n she goes, I don't know what the government's saying,\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:03.280\n but she goes, it's a real knife fight out here.\n\n18:03.280 --> 18:05.040\n You know, an old grizzled woman, real realtor,\n\n18:05.040 --> 18:08.640\n tanned skin, sig out the mouth, driving a Porsche.\n\n18:08.640 --> 18:10.320\n It's a real knife fight out here.\n\n18:10.320 --> 18:12.480\n Her entire life had become real estate.\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:14.000\n Her soul had been hollowed out.\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:15.720\n Her kids hate her.\n\n18:15.720 --> 18:16.920\n No one's made her come in years,\n\n18:16.920 --> 18:20.120\n but she just loves heated kitchen floors infused.\n\n18:20.120 --> 18:20.960\n Fun.\n\n18:20.960 --> 18:23.800\n She's a demon from hell and we need them, truly.\n\n18:23.800 --> 18:24.920\n We're getting rid of them.\n\n18:24.920 --> 18:26.120\n It's not good.\n\n18:26.120 --> 18:27.920\n And she goes, it's a real knife fight out here.\n\n18:27.920 --> 18:30.040\n So we put that in the episode title.\n\n18:30.040 --> 18:31.960\n And of course, I guess some algorithm thought\n\n18:31.960 --> 18:34.040\n that we were showing like people stabbing each other\n\n18:34.040 --> 18:37.760\n in a Wendy's and we got like demonetized.\n\n18:37.760 --> 18:38.960\n Did we get demonetized?\n\n18:41.120 --> 18:42.240\n We lost a lot of views\n\n18:42.240 --> 18:43.640\n because we were kicked out of whatever out,\n\n18:43.640 --> 18:44.880\n like we're just kicked out.\n\n18:44.880 --> 18:46.320\n And then I was asking YouTube about it.\n\n18:46.320 --> 18:47.600\n They were kind of understanding it.\n\n18:47.600 --> 18:49.320\n But even the people that work there\n\n18:49.320 --> 18:51.840\n didn't truly seem to understand the algorithm.\n\n18:51.840 --> 18:53.600\n So can you explain to me how that works\n\n18:53.600 --> 18:55.240\n where they barely know what's going on?\n\n18:55.240 --> 18:58.200\n No, they do not understand the full dynamics\n\n18:58.200 --> 19:01.480\n of the monster or the amazing thing that they've created.\n\n19:01.480 --> 19:04.520\n It's the amount of content that's being created\n\n19:04.520 --> 19:06.320\n is larger than anyone understands.\n\n19:06.320 --> 19:07.520\n Like this is huge.\n\n19:07.520 --> 19:08.440\n They can't deal with it.\n\n19:08.440 --> 19:10.800\n The teams aren't large enough to deal with it.\n\n19:10.800 --> 19:13.120\n There's like special cases.\n\n19:13.120 --> 19:15.560\n So if you fall into the category of special case,\n\n19:15.560 --> 19:18.200\n so we can maybe talk about that, like a Donald Trump,\n\n19:18.200 --> 19:20.080\n where you like actually have meetings\n\n19:20.080 --> 19:22.240\n about what to do with this particular account.\n\n19:22.240 --> 19:24.840\n But everything outside of that is all algorithms.\n\n19:24.840 --> 19:27.400\n They get reported by people\n\n19:27.400 --> 19:30.200\n and they get, like if enough people report\n\n19:30.200 --> 19:32.680\n a particular video, a particular tweet,\n\n19:32.680 --> 19:36.560\n it rises up to where humans look over it.\n\n19:36.560 --> 19:40.840\n But the initial step of the reporting\n\n19:40.840 --> 19:45.480\n and the rising up to the human supervision\n\n19:45.480 --> 19:46.480\n is done by algorithm.\n\n19:46.480 --> 19:48.280\n And they don't understand the dynamics of that\n\n19:48.280 --> 19:50.440\n because we're talking about billions of tweets.\n\n19:50.440 --> 19:55.400\n We're talking about hundreds of thousands of hours\n\n19:55.400 --> 19:58.240\n of video uploaded every day.\n\n19:58.240 --> 20:00.800\n Now, the hilarity of it\n\n20:00.800 --> 20:04.720\n is that most of the YouTube algorithm\n\n20:04.720 --> 20:07.200\n is based on the title.\n\n20:08.360 --> 20:09.360\n That's crazy.\n\n20:09.360 --> 20:11.560\n And the description is a small contribution\n\n20:11.560 --> 20:12.520\n in terms of filtering,\n\n20:12.520 --> 20:14.800\n in terms of the knife fight situation.\n\n20:14.800 --> 20:17.080\n And that's all they can do.\n\n20:17.080 --> 20:19.520\n They don't have algorithms at all\n\n20:19.520 --> 20:22.440\n that are able to process the content of the video.\n\n20:22.440 --> 20:26.040\n So they try to also infer information\n\n20:26.040 --> 20:29.160\n based on if you're watching all of these QAnon videos\n\n20:29.160 --> 20:32.240\n or something like that, or Flat Earth videos,\n\n20:32.240 --> 20:35.800\n and you also watch, are really excitedly watching\n\n20:35.800 --> 20:39.320\n the whole knife fight in Malibu video,\n\n20:39.320 --> 20:42.320\n that says that increases the chance\n\n20:42.320 --> 20:47.280\n that the knife fight is a dangerous video for society\n\n20:47.280 --> 20:48.120\n or something like that.\n\n20:48.120 --> 20:48.960\n Interesting, wow.\n\n20:48.960 --> 20:49.800\n Based on their contribution.\n\n20:49.800 --> 20:52.080\n So people are watching something,\n\n20:52.080 --> 20:54.280\n because I watch QAnon and Flat Earth videos\n\n20:54.280 --> 20:55.760\n to ridicule them.\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:56.600\n Right.\n\n20:56.600 --> 20:57.440\n That, you know what I mean?\n\n20:57.440 --> 20:59.960\n I watch these videos and I make fun of them on my show.\n\n20:59.960 --> 21:00.800\n But what's interesting is,\n\n21:00.800 --> 21:03.200\n if I then go watch something else,\n\n21:03.200 --> 21:04.560\n I'm increasing the likelihood\n\n21:04.560 --> 21:06.120\n that that video is gonna get looked at\n\n21:06.120 --> 21:07.920\n as potentially subversive or dangerous.\n\n21:07.920 --> 21:08.760\n Exactly.\n\n21:08.760 --> 21:09.600\n That's why.\n\n21:09.600 --> 21:12.040\n So they make decisions about who you are,\n\n21:12.040 --> 21:13.400\n who you are as a human being,\n\n21:13.400 --> 21:15.000\n as a watcher, as a visual user,\n\n21:15.000 --> 21:17.920\n based on the clusters of videos you're in.\n\n21:17.920 --> 21:20.480\n But those clusters are not manually determined.\n\n21:20.480 --> 21:23.200\n They're automatically clustered.\n\n21:23.200 --> 21:24.600\n It's so weird.\n\n21:24.600 --> 21:27.480\n We have titles where they got upset about,\n\n21:27.480 --> 21:29.200\n I don't even understand.\n\n21:29.200 --> 21:32.800\n Like we had a title that was so innocuous, in my opinion,\n\n21:32.800 --> 21:36.120\n and the title of the episode was called Bomb Disney World.\n\n21:36.120 --> 21:41.120\n And I was asking people to consider bombing Disney World.\n\n21:41.400 --> 21:43.920\n And YouTube got angry at that.\n\n21:43.920 --> 21:45.640\n So you don't know why.\n\n21:45.640 --> 21:46.960\n You can never understand why.\n\n21:46.960 --> 21:48.720\n You could have said Disney World is the bombs.\n\n21:48.720 --> 21:50.440\n Right, right, right.\n\n21:50.440 --> 21:52.040\n It's just rearranging.\n\n21:52.040 --> 21:52.880\n That's what it probably meant.\n\n21:52.880 --> 21:53.720\n I wasn't saying do it,\n\n21:53.720 --> 21:58.440\n but I was saying let's start thinking about plans to do,\n\n21:58.440 --> 22:01.800\n not let's do it, but let's get in the mind.\n\n22:01.800 --> 22:03.840\n Let's change the conversation.\n\n22:03.840 --> 22:05.880\n I think it's very interesting because as a comedian,\n\n22:05.880 --> 22:06.920\n you don't wanna live in that world\n\n22:06.920 --> 22:08.000\n of worrying about algorithms.\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.320\n You don't wanna worry about deplatforming\n\n22:09.320 --> 22:10.160\n and shadowbanning.\n\n22:10.160 --> 22:11.440\n I mean, all these conversations\n\n22:11.440 --> 22:13.480\n that I've had with other comedians about shadowbanning,\n\n22:13.480 --> 22:14.360\n I mean, it's hilarious.\n\n22:14.360 --> 22:16.720\n We all call each other, I think I'm being shadowbanned.\n\n22:16.720 --> 22:18.280\n Are you being shadowbanned?\n\n22:18.280 --> 22:20.640\n Nobody knew what that word was a month ago,\n\n22:20.640 --> 22:21.640\n I mean, a year ago,\n\n22:21.640 --> 22:24.280\n but everyone now is convinced that everything they do\n\n22:24.280 --> 22:26.880\n that isn't succeeding is being shadowbanned.\n\n22:26.880 --> 22:30.000\n So it's this new paranoia,\n\n22:30.000 --> 22:33.240\n this algorithmic paranoia now that we all kinda have\n\n22:33.240 --> 22:36.560\n because there are genuine instances\n\n22:36.560 --> 22:39.480\n of people being taken out of an algorithm,\n\n22:39.480 --> 22:41.360\n you know, rightly or wrongly,\n\n22:41.360 --> 22:42.640\n however you wanna believe.\n\n22:42.640 --> 22:44.600\n But then there are also things that just don't perform\n\n22:44.600 --> 22:46.920\n as well for a myriad of reasons.\n\n22:46.920 --> 22:50.520\n And then we're all saying like, well, they're against me.\n\n22:50.520 --> 22:51.800\n They're shutting me down.\n\n22:51.800 --> 22:54.920\n And you don't know if that's true or not, you know?\n\n22:54.920 --> 22:57.400\n What do you think about this moment in history,\n\n22:57.400 --> 22:59.800\n which was really troubling to me?\n\n23:01.000 --> 23:03.760\n We could talk about several troubling aspects,\n\n23:03.760 --> 23:08.760\n but one is Amazon removing Parler from AWS.\n\n23:09.440 --> 23:13.640\n To me, that was the most clearly troubling.\n\n23:13.640 --> 23:16.680\n It felt like it created a more dangerous world\n\n23:16.680 --> 23:21.680\n when the infrastructure on which you have competing\n\n23:23.080 --> 23:26.920\n medium of communications now puts its finger on the scale,\n\n23:26.920 --> 23:30.520\n now influences who wins and who loses.\n\n23:30.520 --> 23:32.560\n Absolutely, you're right.\n\n23:32.560 --> 23:35.120\n And what you're always told is like,\n\n23:35.120 --> 23:37.560\n if you don't like Twitter, create your own service.\n\n23:37.560 --> 23:40.000\n Or if you don't like something, you can do your own thing.\n\n23:40.000 --> 23:45.000\n Or if you are, and basically because, you know, tech,\n\n23:45.000 --> 23:46.880\n you have to be in business with one of five companies.\n\n23:46.880 --> 23:50.240\n And I think it's like Amazon, Facebook, Google, YouTube,\n\n23:50.240 --> 23:51.920\n and Twitter, whatever, they're like, you know,\n\n23:51.920 --> 23:54.080\n I mean, Amazon puts everything on the cloud,\n\n23:54.080 --> 23:55.120\n you know, Google and YouTube,\n\n23:55.120 --> 23:57.240\n it's all basically the SEO and the advertising.\n\n23:57.240 --> 23:58.360\n And you got to get your name out there.\n\n23:58.360 --> 23:59.880\n You don't wanna be buried in it.\n\n23:59.880 --> 24:01.840\n Like, because you have to do business with it,\n\n24:01.840 --> 24:03.440\n it's a cartel of these companies.\n\n24:03.440 --> 24:05.760\n You understand it better than anybody\n\n24:05.760 --> 24:07.800\n that you are prevented, truly.\n\n24:07.800 --> 24:10.760\n And I think whatever you think about Parler,\n\n24:10.760 --> 24:12.920\n whatever you think about what people are saying on Parler,\n\n24:12.920 --> 24:16.680\n whatever you think about Alex Jones,\n\n24:16.680 --> 24:18.920\n whatever you thought about Milianopolis,\n\n24:18.920 --> 24:21.400\n the state has an interest in,\n\n24:21.400 --> 24:25.360\n and has always had an interest in crushing dissent.\n\n24:25.360 --> 24:26.920\n This is what the state has done.\n\n24:26.920 --> 24:31.760\n This is how they, you know, retain the power they have\n\n24:31.760 --> 24:34.400\n by eliminating dissent where they can.\n\n24:34.400 --> 24:36.280\n Now, because you don't have, you know,\n\n24:36.280 --> 24:37.920\n three broadcast networks anymore,\n\n24:37.920 --> 24:41.120\n and a handful of newspapers that were all run, by the way,\n\n24:41.120 --> 24:45.880\n by people that had been either compromised or happily,\n\n24:45.880 --> 24:48.520\n you know, happily going with the program,\n\n24:48.520 --> 24:51.560\n and you have this wild west of the internet,\n\n24:51.560 --> 24:54.320\n people like me, people that make,\n\n24:54.320 --> 24:57.200\n I make funny content that I hope is funny,\n\n24:57.200 --> 24:59.440\n but a lot of it is wild and crazy.\n\n24:59.440 --> 25:01.720\n I say a lot of wild and crazy things.\n\n25:01.720 --> 25:02.800\n They're very funny.\n\n25:02.800 --> 25:05.920\n I say a lot of wild and crazy things about powerful people.\n\n25:05.920 --> 25:07.200\n You mock the powerful in there\n\n25:07.200 --> 25:09.160\n by bringing them down a notch.\n\n25:09.160 --> 25:10.280\n We'll probably talk about it,\n\n25:10.280 --> 25:15.280\n but humor is one of the tools to balance the powers\n\n25:16.200 --> 25:17.200\n in society.\n\n25:17.200 --> 25:18.040\n Well, sure.\n\n25:18.040 --> 25:19.800\n And to make people feel better about things\n\n25:19.800 --> 25:22.440\n and to, you know, whatever the case may be, right?\n\n25:22.440 --> 25:23.840\n That's my goal is to kind of like,\n\n25:23.840 --> 25:25.560\n hey, people have had a shitty day.\n\n25:25.560 --> 25:29.280\n If this video or podcast makes you laugh, that's great.\n\n25:29.280 --> 25:31.280\n I think that it won't ever,\n\n25:31.280 --> 25:32.960\n it was never gonna stop at Alex Jones.\n\n25:32.960 --> 25:35.480\n Not that I think he should have been taking off everything\n\n25:35.480 --> 25:36.560\n the way he was,\n\n25:36.560 --> 25:41.400\n but this keeps going until we have sanitized\n\n25:41.400 --> 25:42.560\n all of social media.\n\n25:42.560 --> 25:44.880\n And what they really want it to be\n\n25:44.880 --> 25:46.600\n is what Instagram is kind of becoming,\n\n25:46.600 --> 25:48.440\n which is a marketplace of,\n\n25:48.440 --> 25:51.080\n you could just go and buy sneakers, go buy a sweatshirt,\n\n25:51.080 --> 25:53.640\n go buy jeans, go buy this, go buy that.\n\n25:53.640 --> 25:56.000\n And the idea of the free exchange of information\n\n25:56.000 --> 25:58.280\n seems to be the old internet.\n\n25:58.280 --> 26:01.800\n And it seems the new internet seems to be, you know,\n\n26:01.800 --> 26:03.400\n hyper, and I'm a capitalist,\n\n26:03.400 --> 26:05.000\n but this seems to be like hyper capitalist\n\n26:05.000 --> 26:08.720\n in the sense of like, they only want you consuming things\n\n26:08.720 --> 26:12.000\n and they don't want you thinking too much.\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:13.480\n And that seems to be where it's heading.\n\n26:13.480 --> 26:14.840\n I've even seen that with Instagram\n\n26:14.840 --> 26:16.600\n where it's like everything on Instagram is like,\n\n26:16.600 --> 26:19.000\n buy a sweatshirt, you know?\n\n26:19.000 --> 26:21.000\n And I'm like, all right, man.\n\n26:21.000 --> 26:23.080\n Hey man, if I want a sweatshirt, I'll get it.\n\n26:23.080 --> 26:25.040\n Like, relax.\n\n26:25.040 --> 26:29.800\n You know, just every ad seems to be encouraging consumption,\n\n26:29.800 --> 26:33.760\n but very few things seem geared towards,\n\n26:33.760 --> 26:37.440\n hey, let's have a dialogue or let's,\n\n26:37.440 --> 26:38.920\n and not that Instagram was ever great for that,\n\n26:38.920 --> 26:40.520\n but like, if everything's are geared now\n\n26:40.520 --> 26:42.360\n towards content on Instagram,\n\n26:42.360 --> 26:44.800\n a lot of it seems geared towards shopping.\n\n26:44.800 --> 26:46.960\n See, I don't know, that's an interesting point.\n\n26:46.960 --> 26:50.800\n I don't know if the consumerism that capitalism leads to\n\n26:50.800 --> 26:53.760\n is necessarily gets in the way of nuanced conversation.\n\n26:53.760 --> 26:57.160\n I feel like you could still sell Tim Dillon sweatshirts\n\n26:57.160 --> 26:59.640\n and have a difficult nuanced conversation\n\n26:59.640 --> 27:03.480\n or mock the current president, the previous president,\n\n27:03.480 --> 27:05.400\n mock the powerful, all that kind of stuff.\n\n27:05.400 --> 27:06.240\n Yeah, we try.\n\n27:06.240 --> 27:07.080\n We try to balance that.\n\n27:07.080 --> 27:08.080\n Do you have sweatshirts?\n\n27:08.080 --> 27:09.720\n We do.\n\n27:09.720 --> 27:11.440\n Are they on sale now, fake business?\n\n27:12.440 --> 27:14.080\n We do, fake business sweatshirt\n\n27:14.080 --> 27:15.400\n with the Enron logo, fake business,\n\n27:15.400 --> 27:17.240\n because I do fake business all the time.\n\n27:17.240 --> 27:18.800\n It would be nice if you talk about Alex Jones\n\n27:18.800 --> 27:21.280\n if you plug the sweatshirt during that conversation.\n\n27:21.280 --> 27:23.240\n Yeah, we'll do that, absolutely.\n\n27:23.240 --> 27:25.200\n But what I tend to worry about with,\n\n27:26.120 --> 27:29.600\n I see social media and technology\n\n27:29.600 --> 27:32.280\n existing to flatten society.\n\n27:32.280 --> 27:34.440\n It makes people very boring.\n\n27:34.440 --> 27:38.680\n All of the experiences kids have right now are online.\n\n27:38.680 --> 27:40.600\n Many of their closest friendships are online.\n\n27:40.600 --> 27:42.920\n Their first relationships are online.\n\n27:42.920 --> 27:45.640\n The culture is very homogenous,\n\n27:45.640 --> 27:47.960\n and I think it's eliminating characters.\n\n27:47.960 --> 27:49.680\n It's eliminating interesting people.\n\n27:49.680 --> 27:52.200\n It's making people into AI.\n\n27:52.200 --> 27:53.040\n All of their tastes.\n\n27:53.040 --> 27:53.880\n Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\n27:53.880 --> 27:54.720\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.\n\n27:54.720 --> 27:56.920\n AI could be Charles Bukowski as well.\n\n27:56.920 --> 27:57.880\n Let's not get crazy.\n\n27:57.880 --> 27:59.600\n It's not there yet, right?\n\n27:59.600 --> 28:03.720\n I mean, the $75,000 dog is not doing anything.\n\n28:03.720 --> 28:06.360\n So we're not there yet.\n\n28:06.360 --> 28:07.200\n Listen, I hate people.\n\n28:07.200 --> 28:08.280\n I get why you like AI so much.\n\n28:08.280 --> 28:11.240\n I hate people too, and I'm very amenable to AI,\n\n28:11.240 --> 28:12.920\n and I agree with you.\n\n28:12.920 --> 28:14.080\n Listen, I think the future,\n\n28:14.080 --> 28:15.720\n we gotta get everyone out of here.\n\n28:15.720 --> 28:17.480\n I'm with you on that, so don't think I'm.\n\n28:17.480 --> 28:18.360\n I love people.\n\n28:18.360 --> 28:20.720\n He's manipulating my mind and my.\n\n28:20.720 --> 28:22.800\n That's why the flash of light in your eyes\n\n28:22.800 --> 28:24.360\n when you talked about that dog\n\n28:24.360 --> 28:27.120\n was so much more than any person.\n\n28:27.120 --> 28:28.000\n And I get it, by the way.\n\n28:28.000 --> 28:28.840\n You're right.\n\n28:28.840 --> 28:30.000\n I hate people, but if we could.\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:30.840\n They're not excited.\n\n28:30.840 --> 28:33.840\n If we could just use robots to kill most of them,\n\n28:33.840 --> 28:35.880\n I think that would be good for society.\n\n28:35.880 --> 28:37.120\n I'm with that too,\n\n28:37.120 --> 28:40.520\n but I think that social media flattens people.\n\n28:40.520 --> 28:42.320\n Flattening the personalities of characters.\n\n28:42.320 --> 28:43.600\n Flatten the personalities of people, man.\n\n28:43.600 --> 28:45.040\n And it's just, you know, when's the last time?\n\n28:45.040 --> 28:47.640\n Like, I like the idea of like, you know,\n\n28:47.640 --> 28:51.240\n and I'm, you know, somebody showing up to high school\n\n28:51.240 --> 28:53.000\n with like a backpack and taking out an old CD\n\n28:53.000 --> 28:54.560\n and being like, hey man, here's this band\n\n28:54.560 --> 28:56.840\n you've never heard of that I love\n\n28:56.840 --> 28:58.280\n or whatever, you gotta get into this.\n\n28:58.280 --> 29:00.120\n And I'm like, you know, when I talk to young,\n\n29:00.120 --> 29:01.360\n you know, I have friends that have younger brothers\n\n29:01.360 --> 29:02.480\n and everything.\n\n29:02.480 --> 29:04.760\n And I know that the dominant culture was always dominant.\n\n29:04.760 --> 29:05.880\n I'm not an idiot, but like,\n\n29:05.880 --> 29:08.480\n I feel like it's harder to be unique and original now\n\n29:08.480 --> 29:12.000\n because so much of what's promoted\n\n29:12.000 --> 29:15.360\n is just this way to kind of corral people\n\n29:15.360 --> 29:18.700\n into believing and thinking a certain set of ideals\n\n29:18.700 --> 29:20.800\n that's constantly shifting and evolving.\n\n29:20.800 --> 29:23.400\n And people are just caught up in that.\n\n29:23.400 --> 29:27.280\n And to me, it gets very boring very quickly.\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:29.720\n I hate being bored and that's what it is.\n\n29:29.720 --> 29:30.640\n I don't know what to do with that\n\n29:30.640 --> 29:33.120\n because at the same time, podcasts are really popular,\n\n29:33.120 --> 29:34.640\n long form podcasts are really popular\n\n29:34.640 --> 29:38.320\n and people are hungry for those kinds of conversations.\n\n29:38.320 --> 29:41.000\n There's a lot of dangerous ideas, quote unquote,\n\n29:41.000 --> 29:44.920\n flowing, being spread around through podcasts,\n\n29:44.920 --> 29:46.640\n meaning just like debates.\n\n29:46.640 --> 29:47.480\n Correct.\n\n29:47.480 --> 29:49.080\n You know, so that's still popular.\n\n29:49.080 --> 29:50.580\n So I don't know what to.\n\n29:50.580 --> 29:51.420\n I agree with you.\n\n29:51.420 --> 29:52.440\n That gives me hope, I guess.\n\n29:52.440 --> 29:53.280\n I hope so too.\n\n29:53.280 --> 29:55.360\n And like I said, I look at the negative a lot\n\n29:55.360 --> 29:57.200\n because that's what I usually make fun of,\n\n29:57.200 --> 30:00.000\n but there's a lot of positive stuff happening too.\n\n30:00.000 --> 30:02.060\n Let's talk a bit about Alex Jones.\n\n30:04.640 --> 30:06.780\n So you've gotten a chance to talk to him\n\n30:06.780 --> 30:09.080\n while you were on the Joe Rogan Experience.\n\n30:09.080 --> 30:10.520\n I've been on Alex's show.\n\n30:10.520 --> 30:12.920\n I've talked, I've had Alex on my show.\n\n30:12.920 --> 30:15.320\n I've talked to Alex for three hours\n\n30:15.320 --> 30:18.080\n in front of, I guess it was maybe like 15 million people\n\n30:18.080 --> 30:19.040\n right on Joe's show.\n\n30:19.040 --> 30:20.660\n It was a really wild conversation.\n\n30:20.660 --> 30:24.320\n I think it was one of the coolest moments in broadcasting\n\n30:24.320 --> 30:26.760\n that clearly that I've ever been a part of.\n\n30:26.760 --> 30:29.180\n But I think it goes in the lexicon of like,\n\n30:29.180 --> 30:31.240\n these are big podcasts.\n\n30:31.240 --> 30:33.140\n Like I think it's one of the biggest podcasts.\n\n30:33.140 --> 30:35.300\n A week before the election, Alex Jones.\n\n30:35.300 --> 30:37.280\n I'm really grateful that Joe gave me the opportunity\n\n30:37.280 --> 30:38.440\n to be there.\n\n30:38.440 --> 30:41.400\n And it was just an amazing conversation to watch.\n\n30:41.400 --> 30:43.600\n What was the shirt you wore?\n\n30:43.600 --> 30:44.440\n Fridges Lane.\n\n30:44.440 --> 30:46.520\n It was a fun joke that no one in tech got\n\n30:46.520 --> 30:48.760\n because we all know how funny they are.\n\n30:48.760 --> 30:50.800\n But the tech writers, which is mainly blue haired.\n\n30:50.800 --> 30:51.640\n I do not agree with these statements.\n\n30:51.640 --> 30:53.200\n It's mainly blue haired people\n\n30:53.200 --> 30:55.600\n whose goal in life is to find things\n\n30:55.600 --> 30:57.440\n to give them orgasms with.\n\n30:57.440 --> 31:00.200\n If you want to dye your hair blue, it's your choice.\n\n31:00.200 --> 31:01.040\n I respect it.\n\n31:01.040 --> 31:02.520\n Yeah, but is it your choice?\n\n31:02.520 --> 31:04.480\n But at the end of the day, it's like,\n\n31:04.480 --> 31:06.520\n all the tech writers, like a lot of people just,\n\n31:06.520 --> 31:08.920\n and I'm not, I'm just maligning tech unfairly.\n\n31:08.920 --> 31:10.400\n But a lot of people that sense there's a humor\n\n31:10.400 --> 31:12.800\n were like, he's advocating for human trafficking.\n\n31:12.800 --> 31:13.960\n I'm like, it's clearly a joke\n\n31:13.960 --> 31:16.600\n because we're coming off the believe all women.\n\n31:16.600 --> 31:17.760\n We're coming off that.\n\n31:17.760 --> 31:20.240\n And it's very funny to just say Fridges Lane,\n\n31:20.240 --> 31:21.360\n hey man, believe all women.\n\n31:21.360 --> 31:24.840\n Like, it's just our politics and our public sphere\n\n31:24.840 --> 31:26.880\n is so schizophrenic right now\n\n31:26.880 --> 31:28.360\n that when you point that out,\n\n31:28.360 --> 31:29.880\n people are going to be angry with you.\n\n31:29.880 --> 31:31.680\n But that was a fun shirt to wear.\n\n31:31.680 --> 31:34.400\n But on Alex, you know, I was one of the people\n\n31:34.400 --> 31:37.280\n that found him really entertaining,\n\n31:37.280 --> 31:40.560\n that the same kind of thing as with Bukowski,\n\n31:40.560 --> 31:44.280\n these kinds of personalities that are wild,\n\n31:44.280 --> 31:46.760\n crazy, full of ideas.\n\n31:46.760 --> 31:48.480\n They don't have to be grounded in truth at all,\n\n31:48.480 --> 31:50.800\n or they can be grounded in truth a little bit.\n\n31:50.800 --> 31:53.040\n Like, he's just playing with ideas,\n\n31:53.040 --> 31:55.880\n like a jazz musician, screaming sometimes.\n\n31:55.880 --> 31:57.760\n Obviously he has some demons.\n\n31:57.760 --> 32:01.200\n Sometimes he's super angry for no reason whatsoever\n\n32:01.200 --> 32:04.440\n at some weird thing that he's constructing in his own head.\n\n32:04.440 --> 32:06.520\n Sometimes he's super loving and peaceful,\n\n32:06.520 --> 32:08.360\n especially lately that I've heard him,\n\n32:08.360 --> 32:09.320\n I don't know if you've seen with him,\n\n32:09.320 --> 32:11.560\n with Michael Malice, where he's doing,\n\n32:11.560 --> 32:14.320\n like Malice was doing,\n\n32:14.320 --> 32:17.240\n like telling Alex Jones, I love you, Alex.\n\n32:17.240 --> 32:20.160\n Just this loving kind of softness and kindness\n\n32:20.160 --> 32:21.120\n underneath it all.\n\n32:21.120 --> 32:22.600\n I don't know what to make of any of it.\n\n32:22.600 --> 32:24.520\n And then there's this huge number of people\n\n32:24.520 --> 32:28.560\n that tell me that Alex Jones is dangerous for society.\n\n32:29.440 --> 32:30.640\n So what do you do with that?\n\n32:30.640 --> 32:32.360\n Do you think he's dangerous for society?\n\n32:32.360 --> 32:35.000\n Do you think he is one of the sort of\n\n32:35.000 --> 32:37.480\n entertaining personalities of our time\n\n32:37.480 --> 32:39.800\n that shouldn't be suppressed or somewhere in between?\n\n32:39.800 --> 32:43.880\n I don't think that Alex per se is dangerous for society.\n\n32:43.880 --> 32:46.520\n I think the greater danger for society comes again\n\n32:46.520 --> 32:50.040\n from stifling all dissent, right?\n\n32:50.040 --> 32:53.120\n All, like anybody with a voice that uses it,\n\n32:53.120 --> 32:54.920\n that critiques the government,\n\n32:54.920 --> 32:58.120\n and putting all of those people in a category\n\n32:58.120 --> 33:00.280\n and getting rid of them is incredibly dangerous.\n\n33:00.280 --> 33:01.840\n To me, more so.\n\n33:01.840 --> 33:05.440\n I think the biggest problem that Alex has ever had\n\n33:05.440 --> 33:08.160\n was when he questioned the Sandy Hook shooting.\n\n33:08.160 --> 33:09.640\n And that really was,\n\n33:09.640 --> 33:12.920\n because it really is this identifiable incident\n\n33:12.920 --> 33:15.480\n that you can look at where it did get away from him\n\n33:15.480 --> 33:16.880\n and a lot of his fans who,\n\n33:16.880 --> 33:18.760\n the people that are attracted to conspiracy stuff,\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:20.040\n and I have some of those fans,\n\n33:20.040 --> 33:21.840\n some of them are really smart people,\n\n33:21.840 --> 33:23.480\n some of them are mentally unwell.\n\n33:23.480 --> 33:25.680\n A lot of them happen to be mentally unwell.\n\n33:25.680 --> 33:27.160\n So when you have a fan base of people\n\n33:27.160 --> 33:28.920\n where some of them are mentally unwell,\n\n33:28.920 --> 33:33.920\n and you are questioning tragic events, okay?\n\n33:33.920 --> 33:35.520\n And Alex was right about Epstein.\n\n33:35.520 --> 33:36.680\n He was right about a lot of things,\n\n33:36.680 --> 33:38.360\n and he's got no credit for that.\n\n33:38.360 --> 33:40.840\n And I understand that this,\n\n33:40.840 --> 33:42.480\n sometimes when you write about 10 things\n\n33:42.480 --> 33:43.800\n and you're wrong about something,\n\n33:43.800 --> 33:48.560\n and the thing you're wrong about is so offensive to people,\n\n33:48.560 --> 33:50.600\n you're never gonna get any credit for being right,\n\n33:50.600 --> 33:52.880\n even though you were right more than when you were wrong.\n\n33:52.880 --> 33:56.760\n The problem was a lot of his fans who were crazy stalked,\n\n33:56.760 --> 34:00.040\n harassed these families and accused them of being actors\n\n34:00.040 --> 34:02.680\n and accused them of faking their children's deaths.\n\n34:02.680 --> 34:06.040\n It was just horrific experience.\n\n34:06.040 --> 34:08.080\n And Alex is tied to that.\n\n34:08.080 --> 34:13.080\n And how much he inspired that by what he did on his show,\n\n34:14.360 --> 34:18.160\n I don't know because I haven't watched hours and hours\n\n34:18.160 --> 34:21.640\n of that particular thing, the whole Sandy Hook thing.\n\n34:22.600 --> 34:24.720\n If you listen to him, he says, I really covered it.\n\n34:24.720 --> 34:26.440\n I kind of covered it and moved on.\n\n34:26.440 --> 34:29.000\n Other people go, no, he spent a long time on it.\n\n34:29.000 --> 34:32.080\n But that's the real danger of going into that territory\n\n34:32.080 --> 34:33.320\n over and over again,\n\n34:33.320 --> 34:37.000\n going everything's a false flag or everything's fake.\n\n34:37.000 --> 34:39.440\n I think Alex has actually been kind of reasonable.\n\n34:39.440 --> 34:43.440\n He's resisted a lot of the politics of racial resentment\n\n34:43.440 --> 34:46.040\n on the alt right, for example, he's resisted that.\n\n34:46.040 --> 34:49.400\n He's resisted the antisemitic currents\n\n34:49.400 --> 34:51.200\n of a lot of that politics.\n\n34:51.200 --> 34:55.560\n He's resisted a lot of the virulently anti trans\n\n34:55.560 --> 34:56.400\n or anti gay stuff.\n\n34:56.400 --> 34:57.960\n Now he does dip his toe into the water\n\n34:57.960 --> 35:00.680\n of like the culture wars, of course he does.\n\n35:00.680 --> 35:03.640\n But I've never really seen him,\n\n35:03.640 --> 35:05.080\n and I could be wrong about this,\n\n35:05.080 --> 35:08.520\n embrace white nationalism or identitarianism.\n\n35:08.520 --> 35:10.520\n I've never seen him really go antisemitic.\n\n35:10.520 --> 35:12.880\n I've never seen him take that route.\n\n35:12.880 --> 35:15.320\n When I grew up and I would turn him on every now and then,\n\n35:15.320 --> 35:17.200\n he was talking about NAFTA, the WTO,\n\n35:17.200 --> 35:18.480\n he's talking about 9 11,\n\n35:18.480 --> 35:22.760\n he was talking about the world trade organizations\n\n35:22.760 --> 35:24.040\n and a lot of these big conferences,\n\n35:24.040 --> 35:25.840\n whether it was the Bilderberg group,\n\n35:25.840 --> 35:28.800\n whether it was a Bohemian Grove, which he infiltrated.\n\n35:28.800 --> 35:29.680\n And he was talking about,\n\n35:29.680 --> 35:31.480\n hey, here are the most powerful people in the world.\n\n35:31.480 --> 35:32.760\n Here's what they're doing.\n\n35:32.760 --> 35:34.200\n And here's how it affects you.\n\n35:34.200 --> 35:35.560\n And that was interesting to me\n\n35:35.560 --> 35:37.720\n because no one else was really talking about it\n\n35:37.720 --> 35:42.040\n except Alex Jones, occasionally Art Bell on WABC.\n\n35:42.040 --> 35:45.360\n You'd listen to him at night, right?\n\n35:45.360 --> 35:48.200\n I think Alex became very controversial\n\n35:48.200 --> 35:50.040\n when he decided to back Donald Trump.\n\n35:50.040 --> 35:51.960\n And then he has a considerable following\n\n35:51.960 --> 35:53.640\n and a considerable audience\n\n35:53.640 --> 35:56.760\n that he was then able to marshal\n\n35:56.760 --> 35:59.920\n in the direction of supporting Donald Trump.\n\n35:59.920 --> 36:02.000\n That was when the spotlight,\n\n36:02.000 --> 36:05.520\n because then he was talking to Trump, Trump did his show,\n\n36:05.520 --> 36:07.360\n Alex Jones just got bigger, right?\n\n36:07.360 --> 36:09.000\n And he blew up, that's the term, right?\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:13.800\n He blew off, he put out the Good HBO special,\n\n36:13.800 --> 36:14.680\n whatever you wanna call it.\n\n36:14.680 --> 36:16.840\n He has a hit song, he blew up.\n\n36:16.840 --> 36:18.560\n And then people started looking at the things\n\n36:18.560 --> 36:20.280\n that he was associated with.\n\n36:20.280 --> 36:22.160\n The Sandy Hook thing is a blemish on his record.\n\n36:22.160 --> 36:23.680\n I do believe he regrets it.\n\n36:23.680 --> 36:25.600\n But again, I do see the point of the families\n\n36:25.600 --> 36:27.480\n who are like, dude, fuck this guy forever.\n\n36:27.480 --> 36:29.360\n This is the worst thing I ever went through.\n\n36:29.360 --> 36:34.360\n It's a very tough, I understand the people that say that.\n\n36:35.680 --> 36:38.720\n I understand, and I understand the people that go,\n\n36:38.720 --> 36:41.280\n when you have tech companies that act\n\n36:41.280 --> 36:43.640\n in a coordinated manner to just get rid of someone,\n\n36:43.640 --> 36:46.600\n they don't have any way to defend themselves.\n\n36:46.600 --> 36:49.120\n It's a little terrifying when you think\n\n36:49.120 --> 36:53.520\n about that power being abused and how wouldn't it be?\n\n36:53.520 --> 36:56.040\n Do you think he should have not have been banned\n\n36:56.040 --> 36:57.120\n from all these platforms?\n\n36:57.120 --> 36:59.520\n I don't think, I do think that\n\n36:59.520 --> 37:01.680\n if you are a private company, right?\n\n37:01.680 --> 37:04.680\n I do think, and this is where you run into this problem.\n\n37:04.680 --> 37:06.680\n I don't know if these tech companies\n\n37:06.680 --> 37:09.480\n were government utilities, would that decrease\n\n37:09.480 --> 37:11.000\n people's likelihood of being banned?\n\n37:11.000 --> 37:12.880\n I don't know, right?\n\n37:12.880 --> 37:17.880\n So I understand the benefit of them being treated\n\n37:18.040 --> 37:19.800\n like public utilities and people thinking\n\n37:19.800 --> 37:21.600\n they have the right to a Twitter.\n\n37:21.600 --> 37:25.440\n I've never, I don't know, I have very little confidence.\n\n37:25.440 --> 37:27.120\n I mean, the government's trying to roll out a vaccine\n\n37:27.120 --> 37:29.580\n in California and we vaccinated like five people.\n\n37:29.580 --> 37:32.720\n I mean, in terms of what we need to do in the state, right?\n\n37:32.720 --> 37:34.800\n So maybe if it was a government utility,\n\n37:34.800 --> 37:37.600\n I do think someone like Alex,\n\n37:37.600 --> 37:40.720\n like there should be some process.\n\n37:40.720 --> 37:42.040\n So if you're gonna get rid of someone,\n\n37:42.040 --> 37:44.280\n they should have a way to defend themselves.\n\n37:44.280 --> 37:49.280\n There should be more democratic process\n\n37:50.120 --> 37:51.860\n that you can go through\n\n37:51.860 --> 37:54.580\n than just being unilaterally taken off something.\n\n37:54.580 --> 37:57.160\n But like, then you run into the,\n\n37:57.160 --> 37:58.800\n you're like, am I gonna say that everyone deserves?\n\n37:58.800 --> 38:00.920\n No, if you're threatening or harassing people\n\n38:00.920 --> 38:02.000\n or threatening to kill them,\n\n38:02.000 --> 38:03.240\n publishing their private information,\n\n38:03.240 --> 38:05.840\n if you're committing crimes on these platforms,\n\n38:05.840 --> 38:07.800\n obviously the people that own these platforms\n\n38:07.800 --> 38:10.400\n are gonna be like, we're not gonna allow this to happen.\n\n38:10.400 --> 38:14.280\n So I understand that there is a line, right?\n\n38:14.280 --> 38:16.600\n There is some, like people that say there's no line\n\n38:16.600 --> 38:19.000\n aren't really thinking, like there is a line.\n\n38:19.000 --> 38:22.680\n I just thought that line seems to be moving all the time\n\n38:22.680 --> 38:24.960\n and it seems to be a very hard thing to police.\n\n38:24.960 --> 38:28.200\n But I don't think you can remove a guy off everything\n\n38:28.200 --> 38:31.000\n and then also bank accounts won't give him debit cards\n\n38:31.000 --> 38:32.360\n or credit cards, I don't know if you talked to him\n\n38:32.360 --> 38:34.080\n about that, but like, you know,\n\n38:34.080 --> 38:36.040\n there were financial institutions that were refusing\n\n38:36.040 --> 38:38.000\n to let him park his money there.\n\n38:38.000 --> 38:42.160\n So, I mean, it really does get pretty terrifying\n\n38:42.160 --> 38:43.180\n pretty quickly.\n\n38:44.040 --> 38:46.640\n Probably without any transparency from those companies.\n\n38:46.640 --> 38:50.440\n So you're right, it feels like there should be a process\n\n38:50.440 --> 38:54.160\n of just having, for him to defend himself.\n\n38:54.160 --> 38:55.760\n I think there needs to be a process\n\n38:55.760 --> 38:57.380\n for people to defend themselves.\n\n38:59.160 --> 39:00.880\n Every day I wake up and I go,\n\n39:00.880 --> 39:03.040\n is something I said in a video gonna get taken\n\n39:03.040 --> 39:05.000\n out of context, is somebody gonna get angry,\n\n39:05.000 --> 39:07.840\n is somebody gonna be, you know, I say wild stuff\n\n39:07.840 --> 39:09.240\n because that's what makes me laugh,\n\n39:09.240 --> 39:10.300\n that's what makes my friends laugh\n\n39:10.300 --> 39:12.200\n and that's what makes my audience laugh.\n\n39:12.200 --> 39:17.200\n So I never ever, people, you know, whatever political side\n\n39:17.200 --> 39:20.660\n you come down on, I think if you make your living speaking,\n\n39:20.660 --> 39:24.620\n it's always interesting to me if you are pro\n\n39:24.620 --> 39:27.320\n the deplatforming, that's odd.\n\n39:27.320 --> 39:31.080\n It's interesting to consider a kind of a jury context\n\n39:32.800 --> 39:35.120\n to where, you know, there's transparency\n\n39:35.120 --> 39:38.560\n about why your video about bombing Disney World\n\n39:38.560 --> 39:43.040\n might be taken down, like it gets taken down\n\n39:43.040 --> 39:45.920\n and then there is, it's almost like creating\n\n39:45.920 --> 39:47.800\n a little court case, a mini court case\n\n39:47.800 --> 39:51.400\n and not in a legal sense, but in the public sphere.\n\n39:51.400 --> 39:53.920\n And then people should be able to have, you know,\n\n39:53.920 --> 39:57.560\n we pick representatives of our current society\n\n39:57.560 --> 40:00.760\n and have a discussion about that and make a real vote.\n\n40:00.760 --> 40:03.560\n You know, just have like jury locks himself up\n\n40:03.560 --> 40:08.100\n in a discussion, that kind of process might be necessary.\n\n40:08.100 --> 40:11.720\n Right now, what happens is Twitter is completely,\n\n40:11.720 --> 40:13.560\n first of all, they're just mostly not aware\n\n40:13.560 --> 40:15.680\n of everything they're doing, there's too much stuff,\n\n40:15.680 --> 40:18.000\n but the stuff they're aware about,\n\n40:18.000 --> 40:21.600\n they make the decision in closed doors meetings\n\n40:21.600 --> 40:25.400\n and without any transparency to the rest of the company\n\n40:25.400 --> 40:29.480\n actually, but also transparency to the rest of the world.\n\n40:29.480 --> 40:33.900\n And so, and then all they say is we're making decisions\n\n40:33.900 --> 40:37.760\n because the people, they use things like violence.\n\n40:37.760 --> 40:41.640\n So violence equals bad and if this person is quote unquote,\n\n40:41.640 --> 40:44.800\n inciting violence, therefore that gives us enough reason\n\n40:44.800 --> 40:48.000\n to ban them without any kind of process.\n\n40:48.000 --> 40:51.840\n I mean, it's interesting, I'm torn in the whole thing.\n\n40:51.840 --> 40:54.540\n If it was indeed, there's no transparency about it,\n\n40:54.540 --> 40:59.000\n but if Parler was indeed inciting violence,\n\n40:59.000 --> 41:02.240\n like if there was brewing of violence, potential violence\n\n41:02.240 --> 41:06.820\n where, you know, thousands of people might die\n\n41:06.820 --> 41:10.800\n because of some kind of riot, like this is the scary thing\n\n41:10.800 --> 41:15.320\n about mob, about when a lot of people get together.\n\n41:15.320 --> 41:19.080\n Who are good people, like legitimately good people\n\n41:19.080 --> 41:21.960\n that love this country, that don't see enemies\n\n41:21.960 --> 41:26.080\n yet around them, but if they get excited together\n\n41:26.080 --> 41:30.240\n and there's guns involved and then some cop gets nervous\n\n41:30.240 --> 41:33.440\n and shoots one person, another person shoots the cop\n\n41:33.440 --> 41:35.240\n and then there's a lot of shooting involved\n\n41:35.240 --> 41:38.160\n and then it goes from five people dying in the Capitol\n\n41:38.160 --> 41:41.040\n to thousands of people dying in the Capitol.\n\n41:41.040 --> 41:44.520\n Well, in fairness to defend the people at the Capitol,\n\n41:44.520 --> 41:47.700\n they didn't shoot the cop, they bludgeoned him to death\n\n41:47.700 --> 41:49.560\n with a fire extinguisher.\n\n41:49.560 --> 41:50.400\n Yes.\n\n41:50.400 --> 41:52.960\n So I do wanna just kind of put that out\n\n41:52.960 --> 41:54.720\n as a defense of them.\n\n41:54.720 --> 41:57.400\n Listen, I'm sure there was some wild shit going on\n\n41:57.400 --> 41:59.760\n on Parler and I think the problem, here's the problem,\n\n41:59.760 --> 42:03.520\n right, there's a lot of people that just wanna go on\n\n42:03.520 --> 42:06.400\n these sites and say they wanna kill everyone.\n\n42:06.400 --> 42:09.960\n And the problem is, you know, at what point\n\n42:09.960 --> 42:11.680\n do you shut them all down?\n\n42:11.680 --> 42:14.440\n Like I think a lot of people are just living in a world\n\n42:14.440 --> 42:17.280\n where they're powerless, they don't have any political\n\n42:17.280 --> 42:19.680\n power, they don't have any economic power, right?\n\n42:19.680 --> 42:22.040\n They can't throw their money around.\n\n42:22.040 --> 42:26.100\n They don't have healthcare, their job security isn't great.\n\n42:26.100 --> 42:28.580\n They might be living in a community that doesn't have\n\n42:28.580 --> 42:31.440\n the resources they would like it to have.\n\n42:31.440 --> 42:34.040\n They're not happy and thrilled.\n\n42:34.040 --> 42:36.060\n And then they have these sites where they can go on\n\n42:36.060 --> 42:39.740\n and just say, man, I'd like to fucking burn it all down.\n\n42:39.740 --> 42:42.720\n And distinguishing a guy blowing off steam\n\n42:42.720 --> 42:45.960\n and saying wild stuff from a genuine threat\n\n42:45.960 --> 42:49.000\n is a very hard thing to do, you know?\n\n42:49.000 --> 42:52.860\n Like I've threatened to kill, I got banned from Airbnb,\n\n42:52.860 --> 42:57.520\n I threatened to kill the people that banned me,\n\n42:57.520 --> 43:00.520\n comedically, comedically, this is a joke.\n\n43:00.520 --> 43:02.760\n I'm not going to kill you, this is a joke\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:05.140\n because I'm blowing off steam and I'm angry.\n\n43:05.140 --> 43:07.280\n Do you know how many people that my parents,\n\n43:07.280 --> 43:09.480\n like my dad's like, I'm gonna fucking kill this guy,\n\n43:09.480 --> 43:11.560\n my mom's like, I'm gonna fucking kill.\n\n43:11.560 --> 43:13.160\n They were talking about each other.\n\n43:13.160 --> 43:17.360\n But none of it ever happened, but we should be,\n\n43:17.360 --> 43:21.220\n I think you have to create a space for people\n\n43:21.220 --> 43:24.160\n to threaten to overthrow the government\n\n43:24.160 --> 43:26.880\n as long as they don't violently do it.\n\n43:26.880 --> 43:28.720\n I mean, does that make any sense?\n\n43:28.720 --> 43:32.280\n I mean, as long as they're not gonna go hurt innocent people,\n\n43:32.280 --> 43:33.120\n what are you gonna do?\n\n43:33.120 --> 43:34.920\n Like there's so many people out there that,\n\n43:34.920 --> 43:38.020\n that's why a lot of these things like 4chan, these sites,\n\n43:38.020 --> 43:39.160\n a lot of people going on there,\n\n43:39.160 --> 43:41.600\n they just wanna say the most fucked up shit\n\n43:41.600 --> 43:44.480\n because it's the thing that gives them,\n\n43:44.480 --> 43:46.480\n they can laugh or they can release steam\n\n43:46.480 --> 43:48.980\n and it is immature, it is stupid.\n\n43:48.980 --> 43:51.280\n It's not productive, it's not, you know,\n\n43:51.280 --> 43:52.980\n but at the end of the day,\n\n43:53.880 --> 43:56.280\n if you're not gonna give people health insurance,\n\n43:56.280 --> 43:57.960\n you gotta give them something.\n\n43:57.960 --> 44:00.020\n It's like when someone in this country dies\n\n44:00.020 --> 44:01.880\n that everyone disagrees with, right?\n\n44:01.880 --> 44:03.720\n Political figure, media figure,\n\n44:03.720 --> 44:06.160\n a lot of people dance on their grave online\n\n44:06.160 --> 44:07.920\n and then everyone, people goes,\n\n44:07.920 --> 44:09.760\n and the other side will always do it.\n\n44:09.760 --> 44:12.280\n Like if a conservative dies and everyone goes, great,\n\n44:12.280 --> 44:15.480\n conservatives goes, this is grotesque that you,\n\n44:15.480 --> 44:17.880\n and then when RBG dies, they all have parties\n\n44:17.880 --> 44:19.480\n and the conservatives go, great.\n\n44:20.680 --> 44:22.960\n You have to let people in this country\n\n44:22.960 --> 44:25.060\n enjoy the deaths of their enemies.\n\n44:26.280 --> 44:29.560\n You do because they don't have much else.\n\n44:29.560 --> 44:31.680\n Again, if you gave them other things,\n\n44:31.680 --> 44:34.780\n you might say, guy, you can go get an E operation.\n\n44:34.780 --> 44:36.960\n Why don't you stop?\n\n44:36.960 --> 44:40.440\n But if they're working for shit wages\n\n44:40.440 --> 44:43.560\n and you haven't figured out a way to treat them,\n\n44:44.440 --> 44:48.160\n treat their cancer diagnosis, and they don't like,\n\n44:48.160 --> 44:51.240\n I mean, life, you know, you gotta,\n\n44:51.240 --> 44:54.240\n you gotta derive pleasure from something, right?\n\n44:54.240 --> 44:57.720\n It's an interesting point that anger is a good valve,\n\n44:57.720 --> 45:01.760\n like to, if your life is suffering,\n\n45:01.760 --> 45:04.920\n that there's something very powerful about anger,\n\n45:04.920 --> 45:07.680\n but I still have hope that it doesn't have to be.\n\n45:07.680 --> 45:10.040\n I mean, that kind of channeling into anger\n\n45:10.960 --> 45:13.480\n that then becomes hate led us\n\n45:13.480 --> 45:15.800\n into a lot of troubles in human history.\n\n45:15.800 --> 45:20.720\n So you have to be careful empowering people too much\n\n45:20.720 --> 45:23.840\n in that anger, especially, I think my,\n\n45:24.840 --> 45:28.960\n I think I understand why people are nervous about Parler,\n\n45:28.960 --> 45:30.680\n about Twitter and so on.\n\n45:30.680 --> 45:35.160\n Because all that shit talking about violence\n\n45:35.160 --> 45:39.080\n was now paired with let's get together at this location.\n\n45:40.000 --> 45:41.400\n This was a new thing.\n\n45:41.400 --> 45:46.200\n Like it's not just being on whatever platform talking shit,\n\n45:46.200 --> 45:49.840\n it's saying we're going to in physical space meet.\n\n45:49.840 --> 45:52.520\n And then everybody got, all these platforms got nervous.\n\n45:52.520 --> 45:55.060\n Well, what happens when all these shit talkers,\n\n45:55.060 --> 45:57.960\n all these angry people that are just steam,\n\n45:57.960 --> 46:01.080\n letting off steam meet in a physical space.\n\n46:01.080 --> 46:03.960\n And there was probably overreach,\n\n46:03.960 --> 46:05.240\n almost definitely overreach,\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:07.240\n but I can understand why they were nervous.\n\n46:07.240 --> 46:08.080\n I agree.\n\n46:08.080 --> 46:08.900\n There doesn't seem to be,\n\n46:08.900 --> 46:10.160\n and this is when Trump got elected\n\n46:10.160 --> 46:11.960\n and when you have like, whatever you have, right?\n\n46:11.960 --> 46:13.600\n Whether you have riots in Portland and Seattle,\n\n46:13.600 --> 46:15.760\n where you have the Antifa people doing crazy things,\n\n46:15.760 --> 46:18.660\n you have like the people storming the Capitol.\n\n46:18.660 --> 46:22.000\n There never seems to be a ton of an examination\n\n46:22.000 --> 46:24.560\n of why these ideas are becoming popular.\n\n46:24.560 --> 46:26.240\n Why are people so angry?\n\n46:26.240 --> 46:28.280\n What is leading people to this?\n\n46:28.280 --> 46:29.760\n Why are we here?\n\n46:29.760 --> 46:32.280\n What about their lives is to the point\n\n46:32.280 --> 46:34.880\n where they need to show up at these places?\n\n46:34.880 --> 46:36.600\n And like, and obviously there's going to be people\n\n46:36.600 --> 46:37.440\n on the fringe.\n\n46:37.440 --> 46:38.900\n There'll always be the mentally unwell.\n\n46:38.900 --> 46:41.460\n There'll always be people that want to destroy society.\n\n46:41.460 --> 46:43.640\n But when you look at how popular,\n\n46:43.640 --> 46:46.360\n large, long discredited things,\n\n46:46.360 --> 46:50.080\n whether it's fascism, totalitarian communism,\n\n46:50.080 --> 46:53.320\n all of these things are like, why are they back?\n\n46:53.320 --> 46:54.800\n Why are they back in a big way?\n\n46:54.800 --> 46:58.660\n And why are people so fed up with the status quo\n\n46:58.660 --> 47:02.640\n that they're finding solace\n\n47:02.640 --> 47:07.560\n in the most extreme discredited theories\n\n47:07.560 --> 47:10.000\n of how to run and operate societies,\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.720\n theories that have led to deaths of a lot of people.\n\n47:11.720 --> 47:16.580\n So to me, I'm like, if those people at the Capitol,\n\n47:17.560 --> 47:20.240\n yes, if they were going to work,\n\n47:20.240 --> 47:24.680\n if they were able to go out and drink at Chili's,\n\n47:24.680 --> 47:29.320\n if they were able to get a fucking checkup, right?\n\n47:29.320 --> 47:32.080\n Like if their job paid a little bit better,\n\n47:32.080 --> 47:34.600\n and I'm not saying that this is all the reason, right?\n\n47:34.600 --> 47:36.120\n I'm sure that there's a lot of people there\n\n47:36.120 --> 47:38.680\n that are doing quite well and they're still nuts.\n\n47:38.680 --> 47:40.760\n But like the anger and the rage\n\n47:40.760 --> 47:44.200\n that's boiling to the surface of this society,\n\n47:44.200 --> 47:49.200\n does it come from the fact that across the board\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:51.680\n people in very different areas\n\n47:51.680 --> 47:54.020\n and with very different political beliefs\n\n47:54.020 --> 47:56.560\n feel like they are being fucked over\n\n47:56.560 --> 47:59.540\n and there's nothing they can do about it.\n\n47:59.540 --> 48:02.660\n That's what the baseline to me,\n\n48:02.660 --> 48:05.080\n they look at the people that run the country\n\n48:05.080 --> 48:07.840\n and run the world, whether they're tech titans,\n\n48:07.840 --> 48:08.880\n the guys that you talked to,\n\n48:08.880 --> 48:11.780\n or whether they're people that run the government,\n\n48:11.780 --> 48:14.720\n whether they're people that run large banks,\n\n48:14.720 --> 48:16.380\n large media companies,\n\n48:16.380 --> 48:20.480\n the people that have created this kind of infrastructure\n\n48:20.480 --> 48:21.720\n that everyone lives in,\n\n48:21.720 --> 48:23.760\n these people are incredibly powerless.\n\n48:23.760 --> 48:26.800\n And when you push people to that point,\n\n48:26.800 --> 48:30.040\n logically, sadly, and unfortunately,\n\n48:30.040 --> 48:33.600\n the next thing does seem to be violence.\n\n48:33.600 --> 48:36.680\n Yeah, the thing that troubles me a lot\n\n48:36.680 --> 48:41.680\n is you said nobody's asking why these beliefs are out there,\n\n48:41.680 --> 48:44.340\n but sometimes it's not even acknowledged\n\n48:44.340 --> 48:49.340\n that people are hurting, people are angry,\n\n48:49.800 --> 48:52.900\n just even acknowledging that all the conspiracy theories\n\n48:52.900 --> 48:55.520\n that are out there, acknowledging that they're out there.\n\n48:55.520 --> 48:58.280\n And then people are thinking about it and talking about it\n\n48:58.280 --> 49:00.920\n just because otherwise,\n\n49:00.920 --> 49:03.260\n so it's not acknowledged in this nuanced way.\n\n49:03.260 --> 49:04.660\n What happens is you say,\n\n49:04.660 --> 49:07.660\n okay, 70 million people are white supremacists.\n\n49:07.660 --> 49:12.160\n It's just throwing a kind of blanket statement.\n\n49:12.160 --> 49:16.160\n And of course that gets them angrier\n\n49:16.160 --> 49:19.640\n and makes them feel more powerless.\n\n49:19.640 --> 49:24.640\n And that ultimately, that's what's been painful for me\n\n49:25.000 --> 49:28.280\n to see is that there's not an acknowledgement\n\n49:28.280 --> 49:31.960\n that most people are good.\n\n49:31.960 --> 49:32.840\n Right.\n\n49:32.840 --> 49:36.960\n There's circumstances where it's just you're pissed off.\n\n49:36.960 --> 49:37.800\n Right.\n\n49:37.800 --> 49:38.780\n Because you are powerless.\n\n49:38.780 --> 49:39.960\n I mean, most of us are powerless.\n\n49:39.960 --> 49:42.240\n You could fall in with a bad crowd.\n\n49:42.240 --> 49:44.400\n That's the thing, you can just fall in.\n\n49:44.400 --> 49:47.120\n And it doesn't mean that there's not blame.\n\n49:47.120 --> 49:50.640\n Obviously you have agency, you're a person.\n\n49:51.560 --> 49:54.000\n But the idea that you could be rehabilitated,\n\n49:54.000 --> 49:55.400\n you could do something stupid\n\n49:55.400 --> 49:58.440\n or you could fall into a group of people that are,\n\n49:58.440 --> 49:59.800\n and then in a few years you can go,\n\n49:59.800 --> 50:02.080\n what the fuck was I doing?\n\n50:02.080 --> 50:03.040\n I'm an ex drug addict.\n\n50:03.040 --> 50:05.200\n I know what it's like to go from being one thing\n\n50:05.200 --> 50:06.880\n to being another thing.\n\n50:06.880 --> 50:07.800\n I'm still a drug addict.\n\n50:07.800 --> 50:09.600\n If I would use drugs right now or drink,\n\n50:09.600 --> 50:11.200\n I would still be addicted to them.\n\n50:11.200 --> 50:13.520\n I mean, it's not something that I can ever change\n\n50:13.520 --> 50:14.880\n about myself, but I know what it's like\n\n50:14.880 --> 50:16.340\n to go from one thing to another thing.\n\n50:16.340 --> 50:19.960\n So when you look at racism or whatever ism,\n\n50:19.960 --> 50:22.820\n homophobia, misogyny, whatever you're looking at,\n\n50:22.820 --> 50:26.060\n antisemitism, and you go, that's a fixed condition\n\n50:26.060 --> 50:28.480\n where nobody's ever going to be able to change.\n\n50:28.480 --> 50:30.880\n Nobody's ever gonna be able to be rehabilitated.\n\n50:30.880 --> 50:34.680\n Nobody's ever going to be able to reimagine themselves\n\n50:34.680 --> 50:35.840\n in a different way.\n\n50:35.840 --> 50:38.960\n To me, you're just, you're throwing away someone\n\n50:38.960 --> 50:41.860\n and you're making them feel helpless and worthless.\n\n50:41.860 --> 50:44.020\n And that's gonna lead to antisocial behavior\n\n50:44.020 --> 50:45.960\n that spills out into the violence.\n\n50:45.960 --> 50:48.760\n We don't have a very redemptive society.\n\n50:48.760 --> 50:50.560\n That's a huge factor.\n\n50:50.560 --> 50:52.640\n We don't have a redemptive society.\n\n50:52.640 --> 50:54.600\n That's why I like O.J. Simpson.\n\n50:54.600 --> 50:58.120\n Because O.J. Simpson, yes, he did a bad thing supposedly.\n\n50:58.120 --> 51:01.280\n But he's very kind now on Twitter\n\n51:01.280 --> 51:04.040\n and he makes very nice points about how we all have\n\n51:04.040 --> 51:05.640\n to get involved in the political process\n\n51:05.640 --> 51:07.920\n and he's on golf courses and I like watching people golf.\n\n51:07.920 --> 51:10.080\n I don't do it, but I like watching him do it.\n\n51:10.080 --> 51:12.040\n And he's like an elder statesman\n\n51:12.040 --> 51:13.880\n because I remember him from the naked gun.\n\n51:13.880 --> 51:18.880\n And I choose to forgive him for whatever happened there,\n\n51:19.400 --> 51:20.980\n which I don't know.\n\n51:20.980 --> 51:23.660\n But I choose to forgive him really for,\n\n51:23.660 --> 51:25.800\n I mean, obviously, what they say is\n\n51:25.800 --> 51:27.000\n he cut his wife's head off.\n\n51:27.000 --> 51:30.880\n But I can look past that and redeem him\n\n51:30.880 --> 51:35.160\n because he's very stable on Twitter and he's a good,\n\n51:35.160 --> 51:37.580\n like I see all these people going crazy on Twitter\n\n51:37.580 --> 51:41.600\n and I'm like, O.J.'s lived a full life.\n\n51:41.600 --> 51:43.040\n I think there's a benefit to that.\n\n51:43.040 --> 51:45.480\n There's a benefit to kind of living a full life.\n\n51:45.480 --> 51:48.000\n Yeah, how many of us have not at least tried\n\n51:48.000 --> 51:48.840\n to murder somebody?\n\n51:48.840 --> 51:53.840\n 100%, listen, O.J.'s had the highs and the lows,\n\n51:53.840 --> 51:56.760\n but he did it on his terms.\n\n51:56.760 --> 51:57.600\n And there's a real.\n\n51:57.600 --> 51:59.560\n It's like a Frank Sinatra song.\n\n51:59.560 --> 52:00.480\n Yeah, he did it my way.\n\n52:00.480 --> 52:02.100\n I mean, there's a benefit to that.\n\n52:02.100 --> 52:04.160\n And he seems like a very well adjusted person now.\n\n52:04.160 --> 52:07.460\n So I mean, I don't know, how is that a fact?\n\n52:07.460 --> 52:09.800\n But it is a fact and that's an uncomfortable fact.\n\n52:09.800 --> 52:12.080\n Well, this is a strong case of forgiveness\n\n52:12.080 --> 52:16.240\n in one of the more extreme cases, I suppose.\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:18.820\n But yeah, there's not a process of forgiveness.\n\n52:18.820 --> 52:21.400\n It seems like people just take a single event from your,\n\n52:21.400 --> 52:23.920\n sometimes a single statement from your past\n\n52:23.920 --> 52:28.920\n and use that as a categorical like capture\n\n52:29.800 --> 52:31.880\n of the essence of this particular human being.\n\n52:31.880 --> 52:36.800\n So murder might be a thing that you should get a time out\n\n52:36.800 --> 52:38.280\n for a little while.\n\n52:38.280 --> 52:39.660\n Murder is bad.\n\n52:39.660 --> 52:42.640\n Murder, and let's just say that.\n\n52:42.640 --> 52:44.160\n Murder is not good.\n\n52:44.160 --> 52:46.560\n I'm glad you make this definitive statement.\n\n52:46.560 --> 52:50.640\n O.J. is an interesting cat because you're like,\n\n52:50.640 --> 52:53.300\n he's very stable on Twitter.\n\n52:53.300 --> 52:55.880\n He's very like, he's like, let's take a look at it, guys.\n\n52:55.880 --> 52:57.320\n Like we need more of his energy.\n\n52:57.320 --> 52:58.640\n That's what I'm trying to say.\n\n52:58.640 --> 53:00.600\n I know like, yes, it was bad.\n\n53:00.600 --> 53:03.040\n He killed the woman in the waiter.\n\n53:03.040 --> 53:04.600\n I was not for that.\n\n53:04.600 --> 53:05.880\n I wish he didn't do that.\n\n53:05.880 --> 53:10.040\n But the trial, the O.J. Simpson trial was such a fun thing.\n\n53:10.040 --> 53:12.840\n And like you said, we need more fun people in society.\n\n53:12.840 --> 53:14.040\n Speaking of fun people,\n\n53:14.040 --> 53:17.680\n you've, your politics have been all over the place.\n\n53:17.680 --> 53:18.840\n I hope so.\n\n53:18.840 --> 53:19.840\n I hope so.\n\n53:19.840 --> 53:21.340\n I mean, imagine not,\n\n53:21.340 --> 53:24.040\n imagine someone whose politics weren't all over the place.\n\n53:24.040 --> 53:26.040\n It would seem odd.\n\n53:26.040 --> 53:26.880\n Right.\n\n53:26.880 --> 53:28.760\n In the 10 years that I've been politically conscious,\n\n53:28.760 --> 53:30.360\n just because I'm 35 and 20.\n\n53:30.360 --> 53:32.200\n No, I've probably been conscious for over two decades,\n\n53:32.200 --> 53:34.600\n but like Democrats have become Republicans,\n\n53:34.600 --> 53:36.560\n Republicans become Democrats.\n\n53:36.560 --> 53:37.920\n I remember when Ann Coulter said,\n\n53:37.920 --> 53:40.120\n we need to, he defended George W. Bush when he said,\n\n53:40.120 --> 53:41.880\n we need to go out and Christianize\n\n53:41.880 --> 53:44.080\n or modernize the Arab world.\n\n53:44.080 --> 53:45.800\n We need to democratize the Arab world.\n\n53:45.800 --> 53:48.460\n And then Ann Coulter backed Donald Trump.\n\n53:48.460 --> 53:50.800\n And all the right wing in America believed\n\n53:50.800 --> 53:51.920\n in nation building.\n\n53:51.920 --> 53:56.140\n They believed in going out and democratizing areas\n\n53:56.140 --> 53:58.560\n that might breed radical terrorists,\n\n53:58.560 --> 54:01.040\n whether it was Iraq or wherever you were going,\n\n54:01.040 --> 54:03.640\n toppling regimes and instituting\n\n54:03.640 --> 54:05.760\n new democratic norms in those countries.\n\n54:05.760 --> 54:07.760\n That was the right wing point of view when I grew up.\n\n54:07.760 --> 54:11.080\n Then the right wing switched to,\n\n54:11.080 --> 54:13.200\n we are going to be isolationist.\n\n54:13.200 --> 54:15.120\n We're going to take care of America.\n\n54:15.120 --> 54:16.280\n First and foremost,\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:18.240\n we're not going to go into other countries.\n\n54:18.240 --> 54:20.040\n And then the Democrats who, when I grew up,\n\n54:20.040 --> 54:23.960\n were doves and the right wing people were more hawkish.\n\n54:23.960 --> 54:24.800\n And the Democrats were like,\n\n54:24.800 --> 54:27.680\n the military solutions aren't the way.\n\n54:27.680 --> 54:30.700\n We need to have multilateral diplomatic coalitions\n\n54:30.700 --> 54:32.280\n to solve all the problems.\n\n54:32.280 --> 54:34.000\n Now, Rachel Maddow's like,\n\n54:34.000 --> 54:37.360\n let's nuke Russia every night on MSNBC.\n\n54:37.360 --> 54:38.480\n The Democrats are like,\n\n54:38.480 --> 54:41.960\n we need strong presence in Syria.\n\n54:41.960 --> 54:43.400\n We need a strong presence.\n\n54:43.400 --> 54:45.640\n We need to counter Putin all over the globe.\n\n54:45.640 --> 54:48.040\n We need to get, so they're more hawkish on things.\n\n54:48.040 --> 54:52.360\n So literally I have watched two political parties\n\n54:52.360 --> 54:54.920\n literally flip and it's crazy to watch.\n\n54:54.920 --> 54:58.100\n And in some sense I've watched that as well\n\n54:58.100 --> 55:01.100\n because when I first saw Barack Obama,\n\n55:01.100 --> 55:03.440\n I admired that he was against the war.\n\n55:03.440 --> 55:07.600\n This is whatever, maybe before he was a Senator,\n\n55:07.600 --> 55:10.200\n he spoke out against the Iraq war.\n\n55:10.200 --> 55:15.200\n And then it doesn't feel like,\n\n55:17.240 --> 55:20.240\n it feels like his administration was more hawkish\n\n55:20.240 --> 55:25.240\n than dovish in a sense with all the drone attacks,\n\n55:25.680 --> 55:28.280\n with the sort of inability to pull back,\n\n55:28.280 --> 55:31.600\n or at least in mass efficiently pull back\n\n55:31.600 --> 55:33.560\n from all the military involvement\n\n55:33.560 --> 55:34.840\n that we have all over the world.\n\n55:34.840 --> 55:36.360\n So, and just the language.\n\n55:36.360 --> 55:37.840\n What I think is interesting about that,\n\n55:37.840 --> 55:38.880\n what's interesting about Obama,\n\n55:38.880 --> 55:40.560\n cause this is a very interesting study,\n\n55:40.560 --> 55:43.960\n is that presidents are controlled in very different ways.\n\n55:43.960 --> 55:48.000\n Presidents can be controlled by different factors,\n\n55:48.000 --> 55:51.040\n power factions within Washington.\n\n55:51.040 --> 55:54.600\n I think one of the reasons that Obama was maybe,\n\n55:54.600 --> 55:56.400\n you had a very close relationship with John Brennan,\n\n55:56.400 --> 55:58.040\n he was a CIA director.\n\n55:58.040 --> 56:00.440\n And Obama was very close with John Brennan,\n\n56:00.440 --> 56:05.440\n and Obama was very, I think malleable to the extent\n\n56:07.040 --> 56:09.720\n that the CIA, and I've had CIA agents on my show,\n\n56:09.720 --> 56:13.320\n John Kiriakou, a guy who went to jail for exposing torture,\n\n56:13.320 --> 56:16.160\n was saying that like, you get into the Oval Office,\n\n56:16.160 --> 56:17.000\n all of a sudden you're having\n\n56:17.000 --> 56:18.860\n that presidential daily briefing every day,\n\n56:18.860 --> 56:21.040\n and the intelligence people come in and they go,\n\n56:21.040 --> 56:23.720\n listen man, I mean, there's gonna be a terrorist attack\n\n56:23.720 --> 56:25.880\n on your watch if you don't do X, Y, and Z.\n\n56:25.880 --> 56:28.960\n They go, they call it like blue book information,\n\n56:28.960 --> 56:30.720\n which is five levels above top secret,\n\n56:30.720 --> 56:35.520\n and they go like, hey man, a guy in Iran at a cafe\n\n56:35.520 --> 56:36.960\n said he's blowing everything up next week,\n\n56:36.960 --> 56:38.440\n and you know, I mean, it's the same thing as Parler,\n\n56:38.440 --> 56:39.960\n you don't know if it's true or not.\n\n56:39.960 --> 56:41.600\n But now the president's making a decision\n\n56:41.600 --> 56:44.920\n on usually a lot of uncorroborated intelligence\n\n56:44.920 --> 56:48.160\n that goes into a presentation for the president,\n\n56:48.160 --> 56:49.520\n where you're just terrified every day,\n\n56:49.520 --> 56:51.560\n and you don't want a terrorist attack on your watch.\n\n56:51.560 --> 56:53.720\n Now, so why are they getting all this information?\n\n56:53.720 --> 56:56.600\n Because a lot of the people in Washington\n\n56:56.600 --> 57:00.040\n have an interest in perpetual, constant, ongoing warfare,\n\n57:00.040 --> 57:02.680\n and there's a lot of financial gain to be had from that.\n\n57:02.680 --> 57:04.400\n So they're sneaking their information\n\n57:04.400 --> 57:07.200\n into the presentations that are going to the president,\n\n57:07.200 --> 57:09.200\n and then the president is now behaving and going,\n\n57:09.200 --> 57:11.680\n fuck, I don't want a bomb going off,\n\n57:11.680 --> 57:13.360\n we gotta do what we gotta do.\n\n57:13.360 --> 57:16.600\n And whatever version of that happens,\n\n57:16.600 --> 57:18.520\n that is really kind of what is happening,\n\n57:18.520 --> 57:21.920\n whereas the presidents are being controlled\n\n57:21.920 --> 57:25.600\n by forces that are outside of the political sphere,\n\n57:25.600 --> 57:27.240\n but very much still in it.\n\n57:27.240 --> 57:29.000\n And they have a lot of, that's what the deep state is.\n\n57:29.000 --> 57:31.200\n You know, Trump, there's a lot of ridiculing Trump\n\n57:31.200 --> 57:33.440\n of going, the deep state doesn't exist.\n\n57:33.440 --> 57:35.200\n It absolutely exists, there's been books about it\n\n57:35.200 --> 57:36.800\n written by liberal journalists.\n\n57:36.800 --> 57:41.800\n The deep state is only a term for unelected, largely,\n\n57:42.000 --> 57:44.840\n power factions in Washington, DC,\n\n57:44.840 --> 57:47.880\n that outlive any presidential administration.\n\n57:47.880 --> 57:50.240\n These are people that might work at the State Department,\n\n57:50.240 --> 57:52.640\n they might work at the Defense Department.\n\n57:52.640 --> 57:56.320\n These are people that are not always working officially\n\n57:56.320 --> 57:57.880\n in any government capacity.\n\n57:57.880 --> 58:00.000\n They might be private companies,\n\n58:00.000 --> 58:02.840\n they might be military contractors,\n\n58:02.840 --> 58:04.920\n they might be people at Boeing or Raytheon\n\n58:04.920 --> 58:06.200\n or General Dynamics.\n\n58:06.200 --> 58:10.680\n And they constitute a group of people\n\n58:10.680 --> 58:11.920\n that Trump kind of called the swamp,\n\n58:11.920 --> 58:14.080\n but Trump had really no interest in draining the swamp.\n\n58:14.080 --> 58:18.720\n But he articulated these things, and this is what it is.\n\n58:18.720 --> 58:22.920\n You have a lot of interested parties that have budgets\n\n58:22.920 --> 58:24.600\n that they want, big budgets.\n\n58:24.600 --> 58:26.320\n Everybody wants a budget in Washington,\n\n58:26.320 --> 58:29.320\n whether you know what it is, they want money.\n\n58:29.320 --> 58:31.680\n And these are the people who really control press.\n\n58:31.680 --> 58:34.120\n So this idea that the president is the be all end all\n\n58:34.120 --> 58:35.280\n has got to be smashed,\n\n58:35.280 --> 58:38.080\n which is why the horse race model of politics\n\n58:38.080 --> 58:39.360\n and being like, is it right wing?\n\n58:39.360 --> 58:40.360\n Is it left wing?\n\n58:40.360 --> 58:43.560\n Is it, what team am I on and what color am I wearing?\n\n58:43.560 --> 58:47.240\n It's very simplistic, but the reality is this is an empire.\n\n58:47.240 --> 58:49.080\n It's past its peak.\n\n58:49.080 --> 58:50.000\n We're in trouble.\n\n58:50.000 --> 58:51.920\n The United States is an empire past its peak.\n\n58:51.920 --> 58:53.440\n Yeah, I mean, that's just,\n\n58:53.440 --> 58:55.960\n you could prove that case in court.\n\n58:55.960 --> 58:57.480\n Well, let's go to court right now.\n\n58:57.480 --> 59:01.360\n But I do love the more complex idea\n\n59:01.360 --> 59:04.560\n that there's just human beings who crave power\n\n59:04.560 --> 59:08.120\n and seek ways to attain that power through different ways.\n\n59:08.120 --> 59:13.040\n If you have Barack Obama or George Bush or Donald Trump,\n\n59:13.040 --> 59:15.160\n there's different attack vectors.\n\n59:15.160 --> 59:16.000\n Correct.\n\n59:16.000 --> 59:17.680\n There's different ways to attain that power\n\n59:17.680 --> 59:19.120\n and then you can use that to leverage.\n\n59:19.120 --> 59:23.480\n And it probably doesn't have to be just in Washington, DC.\n\n59:23.480 --> 59:26.560\n There's people who crave power all over the world.\n\n59:26.560 --> 59:29.360\n Of course, but where we are now in Los Angeles,\n\n59:29.360 --> 59:30.720\n these people are all good.\n\n59:31.560 --> 59:32.400\n LA.\n\n59:32.400 --> 59:33.800\n Studio executives and people that I,\n\n59:33.800 --> 59:36.360\n from what I understand, they treat everyone fairly\n\n59:36.360 --> 59:40.560\n and they're nice, but he sees the bad guys,\n\n59:40.560 --> 59:43.680\n but out here in LA, everyone's lovely.\n\n59:43.680 --> 59:48.680\n So amidst this fun exploration in your mind\n\n59:48.880 --> 59:50.640\n through the political landscape that you've done\n\n59:50.640 --> 59:54.040\n over the past couple of decades\n\n59:54.040 --> 59:56.520\n that you've been conscious politically,\n\n59:56.520 --> 59:59.640\n where does Donald Trump fit into this picture for you?\n\n1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:02.800\n Great question.\n\n1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.080\n Well, he didn't, right?\n\n1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:06.120\n Cause we didn't, he wasn't political\n\n1:00:06.120 --> 1:00:07.800\n until four years ago, right?\n\n1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.400\n He got political very quickly before.\n\n1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:12.040\n I mean, he was always firing off crazy tweets\n\n1:00:12.040 --> 1:00:14.040\n about where Obama was born or whatever,\n\n1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:17.880\n but he was, he got into politics like very quickly\n\n1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.200\n and then he became the president, right?\n\n1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:22.040\n So it was like, we didn't, I knew him as Donald Trump,\n\n1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:23.760\n this crazy New York city character,\n\n1:00:23.760 --> 1:00:26.000\n the coast of the apprentice.\n\n1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:27.440\n I didn't think much about him.\n\n1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:29.080\n He was just constant, you know,\n\n1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:31.280\n like he was just this constant figure.\n\n1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:33.000\n Like I don't think much about Warren Buffett.\n\n1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:34.160\n Like I know like Trump's like,\n\n1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:37.640\n he's married to a new show girl all the time\n\n1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:41.000\n and he's always opening another casino and he's on TV.\n\n1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:41.960\n Wait, Warren Buffett really?\n\n1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:42.800\n No, Trump.\n\n1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:44.920\n Trump, but like Warren Buffett is the opposite, right?\n\n1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:47.440\n Warren Buffett's like been married for a billion years,\n\n1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:48.680\n lives in a little house in Omaha,\n\n1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:50.360\n but these are the, that's what I associate Trump.\n\n1:00:50.360 --> 1:00:52.200\n Like I don't think about Warren Buffett.\n\n1:00:52.200 --> 1:00:53.560\n I don't think about these people.\n\n1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:55.640\n They're just guys that I've known forever\n\n1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:57.960\n that have like, you know,\n\n1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:02.520\n you associate certain things with them, right?\n\n1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:04.760\n And Trump, we always associated with kind of vulgar,\n\n1:01:04.760 --> 1:01:08.280\n garish, new money, billionaire, married a lot,\n\n1:01:08.280 --> 1:01:10.760\n you know, casinos, Miss Universe pageants.\n\n1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:13.640\n But again, you know, but it makes perfect sense\n\n1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:18.640\n that he really was able to become president at the moment\n\n1:01:19.200 --> 1:01:22.520\n where we were about to have Hillary Clinton versus Jeb Bush.\n\n1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:24.720\n And I think Americans felt like this is,\n\n1:01:24.720 --> 1:01:27.560\n now the oligarchy is spitting right in our face.\n\n1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.520\n You're not even making it feel like\n\n1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:32.520\n there's an appearance of democracy.\n\n1:01:32.520 --> 1:01:34.240\n We have two crime families\n\n1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:37.080\n vowing for control of the country every four years.\n\n1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:40.480\n And then there was this rogue kind of upstart guy\n\n1:01:40.480 --> 1:01:42.320\n that was really about himself.\n\n1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:44.440\n You know, Trump doesn't really care that much about the,\n\n1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:46.640\n I mean, really was summarized perfectly when he left\n\n1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:48.640\n and he just said, hey, have a good life.\n\n1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:49.480\n That's what he said\n\n1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:51.160\n before he got on Andrews Air Force Base.\n\n1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:53.720\n If you watch his speech, he goes, hey, have a good life.\n\n1:01:53.720 --> 1:01:56.520\n That's what he really feel.\n\n1:01:56.520 --> 1:01:58.360\n Like, hey, have a good life.\n\n1:01:58.360 --> 1:02:00.640\n I'm gonna get on a plane right now\n\n1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:05.560\n and fly to a castle I own in Florida.\n\n1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:08.960\n And really, I'm not gonna think too much about you people\n\n1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:12.280\n outside of how I can get more attention in the future.\n\n1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:14.800\n Can I ask you like a therapy question?\n\n1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.680\n What is your favorite\n\n1:02:17.680 --> 1:02:20.720\n and least favorite quality of Donald Trump?\n\n1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:24.920\n So my least favorite quality of Donald Trump,\n\n1:02:24.920 --> 1:02:28.760\n I think because there's a few of them,\n\n1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:33.400\n his lack of empathy,\n\n1:02:33.400 --> 1:02:35.160\n complete and total lack of empathy.\n\n1:02:35.160 --> 1:02:39.160\n I don't feel that he cares about human beings on any level.\n\n1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:40.680\n And I feel like that's,\n\n1:02:40.680 --> 1:02:43.560\n maybe it should be a requirement, right?\n\n1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:45.160\n I mean, I don't think he cares.\n\n1:02:45.160 --> 1:02:46.480\n I think it's obvious that he doesn't care.\n\n1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:49.240\n I mean, he sent, you know, basically he's saying like,\n\n1:02:49.240 --> 1:02:50.640\n they're in there, Mike Pence is in there.\n\n1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:53.800\n He knows that his people are going to get,\n\n1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:54.640\n try to get into a Capitol.\n\n1:02:54.640 --> 1:02:56.800\n I mean, those motherfuckers are not gonna have jobs.\n\n1:02:56.800 --> 1:03:00.640\n They're gonna go to federal prison and he doesn't care.\n\n1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:02.200\n As long as they're storming the Capitol\n\n1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.720\n to prove the point that he thinks he won the election,\n\n1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:08.960\n he has no concern for these people, his followers.\n\n1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:11.240\n He leads them lambs to the slaughter, right?\n\n1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:13.600\n So that's not a respectable quality.\n\n1:03:13.600 --> 1:03:16.040\n My favorite quality of Donald Trump\n\n1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:18.560\n is his willingness to call bullshit.\n\n1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:20.200\n So his willingness to call bullshit out.\n\n1:03:20.200 --> 1:03:22.400\n He doesn't play the game.\n\n1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:24.440\n He will, you know, when people say about Putin,\n\n1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:25.520\n Putin kills people, he goes,\n\n1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:26.720\n we kill a lot of people here too.\n\n1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.320\n Like he's willing and able to break the fourth wall\n\n1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:33.360\n and say things that no politician has ever said.\n\n1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:36.800\n He's willing to call out hypocrisy, you know,\n\n1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:40.120\n of course not his own, but the media,\n\n1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:41.800\n the members of the political establishment,\n\n1:03:41.800 --> 1:03:43.200\n that's a laudable quality.\n\n1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:45.320\n It's an entertaining quality, right?\n\n1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:46.240\n We all like it.\n\n1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:48.120\n I love, I'm like this guy saying something\n\n1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:49.760\n that a lot of people want said.\n\n1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:54.080\n That being said, it's coupled with no real work or action.\n\n1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:56.520\n So it's not coupled with anything behind it\n\n1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.400\n that he just wants to,\n\n1:03:58.400 --> 1:03:59.800\n we did an episode of my podcast once\n\n1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:01.160\n where it's like essentially he's like criticizing\n\n1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:03.400\n the deep state, he wants a deeper state.\n\n1:04:03.400 --> 1:04:04.440\n He wants a deeper state.\n\n1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:07.880\n Like he hired his daughter and her husband.\n\n1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:09.600\n I mean, this is not a guy that's interested\n\n1:04:09.600 --> 1:04:11.400\n in transparency and openness.\n\n1:04:11.400 --> 1:04:13.840\n He's a guy that would just prefer,\n\n1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:16.720\n he wants to run the mafia state.\n\n1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:20.760\n But he shakes up the norms of social discourse,\n\n1:04:20.760 --> 1:04:22.520\n political discourse, and that people\n\n1:04:22.520 --> 1:04:24.560\n are just hungry for that.\n\n1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:26.960\n Like he got banned from Twitter,\n\n1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:29.080\n from all the different platforms.\n\n1:04:29.080 --> 1:04:31.560\n Do you think, is there an argument to be made\n\n1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.400\n for and against banning Twitter?\n\n1:04:33.400 --> 1:04:35.680\n There's always arguments to be made for everything.\n\n1:04:35.680 --> 1:04:38.200\n A permanent ban seems to be an overreaction to me.\n\n1:04:38.200 --> 1:04:39.720\n He's the president of the United States.\n\n1:04:39.720 --> 1:04:41.160\n It also rearranges the power,\n\n1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:42.440\n like whether you like him or hate him,\n\n1:04:42.440 --> 1:04:45.520\n love him or hate him, he was the president.\n\n1:04:45.520 --> 1:04:47.680\n We've elevated Twitter is now more powerful\n\n1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:48.760\n than the president.\n\n1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:51.200\n It's like, do you want that to be longterm the salute,\n\n1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.920\n that the reality, like now Jack at Twitter\n\n1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:56.520\n is more powerful than the president of the United States.\n\n1:04:56.520 --> 1:05:00.040\n Is that a good paradigm going forward?\n\n1:05:00.040 --> 1:05:01.440\n I don't know.\n\n1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:03.600\n I'm not, listen, maybe give him a little time out\n\n1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:05.000\n for a few days.\n\n1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:08.320\n I think a time out, a little spanking, certainly,\n\n1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:10.840\n but I don't know if a permanent ban across the board\n\n1:05:10.840 --> 1:05:11.920\n on every social media.\n\n1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:13.240\n I mean, they banned them on Grindr.\n\n1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:14.920\n I mean, this is how hilarious it is, right?\n\n1:05:14.920 --> 1:05:17.560\n I mean, they banned them across the board on everything.\n\n1:05:17.560 --> 1:05:19.760\n I don't think he could get an Airbnb now, neither can I,\n\n1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:22.800\n but like, I don't think he can do anything.\n\n1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.320\n Again, I just, I look back and there's so many people,\n\n1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.760\n my very smart, intelligent friends that go,\n\n1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:27.680\n yeah, but who cares?\n\n1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:28.760\n Yeah, but he's bad.\n\n1:05:28.760 --> 1:05:29.760\n Yeah, but blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.360\n Yeah, but I don't like Milianopolis.\n\n1:05:31.360 --> 1:05:32.800\n Yeah, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\n1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:35.280\n And I'm like, you have such faith.\n\n1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:39.040\n You have such faith that it's always gonna be the people\n\n1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:40.560\n you dislike that are banned.\n\n1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:43.120\n It's always gonna be the, it's never gonna be you.\n\n1:05:43.120 --> 1:05:45.320\n Man, you have so much faith in the government.\n\n1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:48.160\n You have so much faith in tech oligarchs you've never met.\n\n1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:51.440\n You have so much faith in the security state\n\n1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:53.720\n that they're gonna always make the right decisions\n\n1:05:53.720 --> 1:05:55.560\n and they're not gonna penalize people\n\n1:05:55.560 --> 1:05:56.880\n that shouldn't be penalized.\n\n1:05:56.880 --> 1:06:00.400\n To me, I'm like, wow, I've never had that much faith\n\n1:06:00.400 --> 1:06:02.200\n in any human being ever, including myself.\n\n1:06:02.200 --> 1:06:03.680\n I wouldn't want that power.\n\n1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:05.840\n I would start deplatforming people that I hate.\n\n1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:08.400\n I would deplatform my aunt, you know what I mean?\n\n1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:10.640\n I would deplatform everyone I know.\n\n1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:14.160\n I mean, so it's such an insane power to give somebody,\n\n1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:16.840\n like who gets heard, who gets to speak?\n\n1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:18.520\n Yeah, I'm worried about the effect it has\n\n1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.080\n on people like you, actually.\n\n1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:20.920\n I agree.\n\n1:06:20.920 --> 1:06:24.520\n Of being, like everybody's a little more nervous\n\n1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:27.480\n in what they say.\n\n1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:28.320\n Correct.\n\n1:06:28.320 --> 1:06:29.440\n And that is a big problem.\n\n1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:30.280\n Yes.\n\n1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:32.800\n Because then you're just like longterm unmasked,\n\n1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:33.720\n like we're talking about.\n\n1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:37.640\n It has an effect where people just become more bland.\n\n1:06:37.640 --> 1:06:41.880\n Yeah, self censorship, anxiety,\n\n1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:43.320\n all of these things go into it.\n\n1:06:43.320 --> 1:06:44.160\n We try to fight it.\n\n1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:44.980\n I try to fight it.\n\n1:06:44.980 --> 1:06:47.120\n I think I gotta still do what makes me laugh\n\n1:06:47.120 --> 1:06:49.480\n and what makes me laugh is often fucked up.\n\n1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:52.640\n And it's often, it's not always fucked up in a way\n\n1:06:52.640 --> 1:06:54.200\n that it's gonna get me thrown off something,\n\n1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:58.400\n but I think pushing certain buttons is funny to me,\n\n1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:00.320\n so I gotta keep doing that.\n\n1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:02.560\n Part of the problem is that so many of the lines\n\n1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:03.400\n are blurred, right?\n\n1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:05.800\n So you have comedians that are commentators\n\n1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:08.360\n and commentators that are comedians and politicians.\n\n1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:10.080\n So it's harder to get the defense of like,\n\n1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:11.820\n hey, I'm a comedian, leave me alone.\n\n1:07:11.820 --> 1:07:13.000\n That defense becomes harder\n\n1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.840\n when all of these lines are blurring.\n\n1:07:15.840 --> 1:07:18.180\n Everybody's kind of everything now.\n\n1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:21.200\n So like people say to me, you should run for office\n\n1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:22.960\n and they're serious and I'm like, you're crazy,\n\n1:07:22.960 --> 1:07:23.800\n but they're serious.\n\n1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:26.740\n Like, so the blurring of everything means\n\n1:07:26.740 --> 1:07:29.240\n that people aren't in their lanes as much\n\n1:07:29.240 --> 1:07:31.960\n and that you go, well, this guy is dangerous\n\n1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:34.640\n because he's not just making a joke.\n\n1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:38.000\n He's doing something else and he's using humor.\n\n1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:38.960\n And I'm like, I'm really not.\n\n1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:40.320\n I'm really just trying to make a joke.\n\n1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:42.120\n That's all, that's really what I'm trying to do.\n\n1:07:42.120 --> 1:07:46.000\n But I do think that because of the flattening,\n\n1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.140\n there's a lot of people out there that go,\n\n1:07:48.140 --> 1:07:49.920\n they take aim at humor because they go,\n\n1:07:49.920 --> 1:07:54.120\n humor is where bad ideas can kind of start and flourish.\n\n1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:57.960\n But don't you, to put some responsibility on you,\n\n1:07:57.960 --> 1:08:00.160\n don't you think humor is a way to,\n\n1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:03.360\n that you are the modern,\n\n1:08:03.360 --> 1:08:05.920\n like Jordan Peterson style intellectual,\n\n1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:08.160\n that humor is actually a tool of.\n\n1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:09.000\n It can be.\n\n1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:10.040\n Changing the zeitgeist,\n\n1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:11.760\n changing the social norms. It absolutely can be,\n\n1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:12.920\n but it also cannot be.\n\n1:08:12.920 --> 1:08:14.400\n I don't think it's any one thing\n\n1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:17.560\n and I think there's a lot of pressure for a comedian.\n\n1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:18.960\n You can be funny and right.\n\n1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:21.080\n You can be funny and wrong.\n\n1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:22.880\n If your goal is to be right,\n\n1:08:22.880 --> 1:08:25.600\n you might end up being right and not funny.\n\n1:08:25.600 --> 1:08:27.840\n So the reality is funny has to come first.\n\n1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:30.160\n There are brilliant people that have been funny\n\n1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:33.240\n and correct according to people, right?\n\n1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:35.040\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.340\n people that put way too much faith in what comedy is,\n\n1:08:38.340 --> 1:08:39.720\n most of what comedy is,\n\n1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:41.560\n is people showing up to strip malls\n\n1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:43.800\n and telling jokes for an hour\n\n1:08:43.800 --> 1:08:45.160\n while people eat chicken fingers\n\n1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:46.620\n and they all get drunk and they laugh\n\n1:08:46.620 --> 1:08:48.800\n and they feel a little bit better about their lives.\n\n1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.520\n That's really the majority of comedy.\n\n1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:53.240\n Then there's like 10 famous people that are really famous\n\n1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:55.760\n that do a version of that in an arena.\n\n1:08:55.760 --> 1:08:57.720\n But the amount of cultural power they have\n\n1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.640\n has always been greatly exaggerated.\n\n1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:01.440\n My uncles loved George Carlin,\n\n1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:03.760\n who was anti military industrial complex,\n\n1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:05.200\n anti this, anti that.\n\n1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.040\n And then they would go vote for Ronald Reagan.\n\n1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:07.960\n They didn't care.\n\n1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:12.800\n It's not as powerful as you think.\n\n1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:13.960\n I wish it was.\n\n1:09:13.960 --> 1:09:15.280\n It feels good.\n\n1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:18.440\n It feels good for me to say I am the new thing.\n\n1:09:18.440 --> 1:09:19.680\n It really isn't.\n\n1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:20.680\n It truly isn't.\n\n1:09:20.680 --> 1:09:23.040\n No one is, comedians are the people that get on stage\n\n1:09:23.040 --> 1:09:24.420\n and say, we're fucked up.\n\n1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:26.200\n We're drug addicts.\n\n1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:27.100\n We're sex addicts.\n\n1:09:27.100 --> 1:09:28.120\n We're fat.\n\n1:09:28.120 --> 1:09:28.960\n We're gross.\n\n1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:29.920\n We can't manage our money.\n\n1:09:29.920 --> 1:09:31.160\n We can't stop eating.\n\n1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:33.120\n We can't stop fucking doing horrible things.\n\n1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:33.960\n We're liars.\n\n1:09:33.960 --> 1:09:34.780\n We're narcissists.\n\n1:09:34.780 --> 1:09:35.640\n We're scumbags.\n\n1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:37.480\n We're the people that get out and say that.\n\n1:09:37.480 --> 1:09:40.620\n Only a psychopath would look at us and go,\n\n1:09:40.620 --> 1:09:42.240\n show me the way.\n\n1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:43.680\n Like it's not.\n\n1:09:43.680 --> 1:09:46.880\n I disagree with you because then I'm a psychopath.\n\n1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:50.680\n Well, and that's, I mean, I don't think,\n\n1:09:50.680 --> 1:09:51.520\n no pushback here.\n\n1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:54.720\n That's another issue.\n\n1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:55.560\n But you know what I'm saying.\n\n1:09:55.560 --> 1:09:58.000\n Well, and I don't because, I mean,\n\n1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:01.040\n I understand you using this as a psychological tool\n\n1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.600\n for yourself to give yourself freedom.\n\n1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.800\n But the reality is you are one of the rare comedians\n\n1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.680\n like a George Carlin who is, besides being funny.\n\n1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:11.800\n When I hear things like that, I'm like,\n\n1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:12.820\n okay, you're being very sweet.\n\n1:10:12.820 --> 1:10:14.080\n But like, I agree.\n\n1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:14.920\n I understand what you're saying.\n\n1:10:14.920 --> 1:10:17.240\n I do stuff that makes, hopefully makes you think.\n\n1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:18.840\n I hope that's what good comedy is.\n\n1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:21.040\n But I think I try to do that.\n\n1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:25.840\n But I also would hate to feel shackled to the idea\n\n1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:28.440\n of that I had to make a point\n\n1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.320\n and that point had to be correct.\n\n1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:33.600\n I think the best comedy makes fun of everything.\n\n1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:34.800\n It makes fun of both sides.\n\n1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:38.200\n And then there's a deeper truth about humanity revealed.\n\n1:10:38.200 --> 1:10:40.480\n But then what happens is people take that deeper truth\n\n1:10:40.480 --> 1:10:42.080\n and go, let's politicize it.\n\n1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.080\n But what does he mean?\n\n1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:44.160\n Is it the right or the left?\n\n1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:46.440\n And I'm like, I'm doing something that I think speaks\n\n1:10:46.440 --> 1:10:49.120\n to hopefully people on both sides for everybody.\n\n1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.080\n Cause I'm making fun of people on the left and the right\n\n1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:52.600\n and in the center and people that don't care\n\n1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:53.480\n and people that do care.\n\n1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:55.520\n And I'm trying to figure out a way to do it.\n\n1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.360\n But then immediately anything of value\n\n1:10:57.360 --> 1:10:59.680\n in this culture right now is like, how do we politicize it?\n\n1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:00.960\n How do we put it in a box?\n\n1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:02.920\n So yes, I think comedy can produce a lot\n\n1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:07.240\n of inherently valuable things, reflective, thoughtful things.\n\n1:11:07.240 --> 1:11:10.440\n But then immediately, can it be put in this box\n\n1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:13.000\n where all of those things can be used politically?\n\n1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:14.040\n No.\n\n1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:15.280\n And unfortunately, like when they say like,\n\n1:11:15.280 --> 1:11:17.120\n comedy is a great way to speak truth to power.\n\n1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:22.120\n It is, but I don't know how much it changes things.\n\n1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:28.480\n I don't know how much a joke can dethrone a king.\n\n1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:30.760\n I know the idea is nice,\n\n1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:34.320\n but let's look at the practical applications.\n\n1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:38.100\n I mean, we had brilliant comics, Bill Hicks,\n\n1:11:38.100 --> 1:11:40.640\n George Carlin, Richard Pryor.\n\n1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:44.120\n We had people talk about so many problems in society,\n\n1:11:44.120 --> 1:11:47.380\n illustrate them, put a spotlight on them.\n\n1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:48.760\n And we still have them.\n\n1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:50.520\n They're worse now than they've ever been.\n\n1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:51.360\n That's not true.\n\n1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:52.640\n I think the society is better.\n\n1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:55.120\n And so to push back in my perspective,\n\n1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:58.000\n it's very possible that those voices\n\n1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.160\n were the exact reason we have the world today,\n\n1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:01.980\n which I do believe is actually,\n\n1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:07.080\n I mean, on the boring old measures\n\n1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:08.760\n of what makes a good world,\n\n1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:12.160\n which is the amount of violence in the world,\n\n1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:15.640\n the amount of opportunity that all those kinds of measures,\n\n1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:17.800\n even happiness, all of those things measured,\n\n1:12:17.800 --> 1:12:19.040\n things have been improving.\n\n1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:21.400\n Steven Pinker gets a lot of shit for this,\n\n1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:23.720\n but he's really good at articulating\n\n1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:25.240\n how the data says pretty clearly\n\n1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:26.720\n that the world is getting better.\n\n1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:30.960\n And it's arguable that the freedoms we do enjoy currently\n\n1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.680\n are thanks to the comedic voices or the people who mock.\n\n1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:37.600\n So to me, it's possible that humor\n\n1:12:37.600 --> 1:12:39.480\n is the very thing that saves the world.\n\n1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.520\n Humor is the very thing that keeps,\n\n1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:44.040\n is the balance of power in the world.\n\n1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:46.320\n But I think a lot of the things that those guys criticize,\n\n1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:50.120\n whether it was militarism or the elites,\n\n1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:52.280\n the lying, the corruption, the bribery,\n\n1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:53.560\n that's still going on.\n\n1:12:53.560 --> 1:12:54.720\n And it's always gonna go on, right?\n\n1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:56.320\n Because that's the nature of human beings.\n\n1:12:56.320 --> 1:12:58.600\n We call it out, we point it out,\n\n1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:01.000\n but we don't have a plan to change.\n\n1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.640\n It's not really our job.\n\n1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:05.520\n And I think that too much now is like,\n\n1:13:05.520 --> 1:13:07.320\n well, comedians should have a,\n\n1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.520\n like, I don't tell people who to vote for.\n\n1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:10.680\n Like the idea that comedians\n\n1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:11.640\n went and told people who to vote for,\n\n1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:13.160\n it's like, to me, it's crazy.\n\n1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.520\n I understand like people have strong opinions,\n\n1:13:15.520 --> 1:13:17.920\n but like, I believe I have a job.\n\n1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:19.880\n And my job is to make you laugh or whatever,\n\n1:13:19.880 --> 1:13:20.760\n maybe make you think,\n\n1:13:20.760 --> 1:13:23.120\n but like, my job is not to tell you who to vote for.\n\n1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:24.160\n I mean, it's absurd.\n\n1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:27.760\n But see, the thing you do by the comedy,\n\n1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:29.040\n like on your Twitter,\n\n1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:30.360\n that people should definitely follow.\n\n1:13:30.360 --> 1:13:33.720\n I believe that, Jim J. Dillon, I agree with you.\n\n1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:35.800\n Oh, on this point of,\n\n1:13:35.800 --> 1:13:37.120\n I agree with you wholeheartedly.\n\n1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.520\n That people should follow you.\n\n1:13:38.520 --> 1:13:40.920\n Yeah, you give me,\n\n1:13:40.920 --> 1:13:45.040\n you give me freedom to think on my own.\n\n1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:47.280\n Meaning like you're shaking things up\n\n1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:49.640\n to where I don't feel constrained\n\n1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:51.520\n about what I can think about.\n\n1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:52.760\n And that's awesome.\n\n1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:54.840\n Thank you.\n\n1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:56.160\n So you're not telling me what to think,\n\n1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:57.480\n you're giving me the freedom to think.\n\n1:13:57.480 --> 1:13:59.400\n And that's what great comedy does,\n\n1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:04.080\n is I don't often agree with George Carlin.\n\n1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:06.840\n He can get pretty political sometimes.\n\n1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:10.240\n But just the ability to do that's so rare.\n\n1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:11.680\n Podcasts do that too now.\n\n1:14:11.680 --> 1:14:12.760\n Like there's certain people\n\n1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:15.800\n that can really just challenge you to,\n\n1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:16.920\n even when you disagree with them,\n\n1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:17.760\n to sort of be like,\n\n1:14:17.760 --> 1:14:19.680\n oh, it's okay to think about this kind of stuff.\n\n1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:21.040\n Yeah, and I appreciate that,\n\n1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:21.880\n because that's awesome.\n\n1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.080\n And I mean, that's great.\n\n1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:25.280\n And a guy like you, who's a brilliant guy, that's great.\n\n1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:28.080\n If I'm giving you the license to think,\n\n1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:30.560\n then man, the world is completely fucked.\n\n1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:31.680\n But I'm happy about that.\n\n1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:32.520\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:33.360\n No, it's...\n\n1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:35.680\n Well, you know.\n\n1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:38.520\n Speaking about the world being completely fucked,\n\n1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:40.640\n Alex Jones turned on QAnon.\n\n1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:41.480\n I know almost nothing...\n\n1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:42.440\n It's a very tough match.\n\n1:14:42.440 --> 1:14:43.640\n They had a rough marriage.\n\n1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:44.600\n They fought it.\n\n1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:46.680\n They fought it out for years.\n\n1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:48.200\n And eventually we just knew\n\n1:14:48.200 --> 1:14:50.520\n someone was gonna leave someone.\n\n1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:52.800\n Hewlett tried to leave him a few months ago.\n\n1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:53.640\n Oh, so...\n\n1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:55.520\n Yeah, he was staying at someone else's house.\n\n1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.080\n The car wasn't in the driveway.\n\n1:14:57.080 --> 1:14:58.560\n Yeah.\n\n1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:01.680\n Well, the thing about QAnon that makes it a lot of fun\n\n1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:04.000\n is it's kind of a make it up as you go along.\n\n1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.000\n I'm a drug addict, right?\n\n1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.080\n So often my lies aren't planned.\n\n1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:10.000\n They're in the moment.\n\n1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.160\n A lot of what I do on the podcast,\n\n1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:12.320\n a lot, you know, it's all in the moment.\n\n1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:13.520\n I'll have an idea what I wanna talk about,\n\n1:15:13.520 --> 1:15:14.760\n and I rant and I go.\n\n1:15:14.760 --> 1:15:16.400\n And I've been like stoned,\n\n1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:17.480\n and I show up at home,\n\n1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:18.560\n and my parents are like,\n\n1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:19.680\n what's going on?\n\n1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:21.080\n There was $50 on the mantle.\n\n1:15:21.080 --> 1:15:22.480\n Now it's not there.\n\n1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:23.400\n And I'm like,\n\n1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:28.400\n well, and I gotta make something up on the spot, right?\n\n1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:31.000\n I've been, you know, are you drinking again?\n\n1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.280\n No, I'm not.\n\n1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:34.560\n And then you gotta have a,\n\n1:15:34.560 --> 1:15:35.760\n well, you were gone for two days.\n\n1:15:35.760 --> 1:15:36.720\n No one knows where you were.\n\n1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:37.880\n And somebody said you left your car.\n\n1:15:37.880 --> 1:15:40.040\n Well, I was at, well, this is,\n\n1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:42.480\n I was at a sales conference and I left my car.\n\n1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:43.400\n I flew to Phoenix.\n\n1:15:43.400 --> 1:15:45.040\n Like, I understand what that is.\n\n1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:47.680\n QAnon is an ever evolving conspiracy theory\n\n1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:50.400\n where the events are happening in the past,\n\n1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:51.600\n in the present, and in the future.\n\n1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:52.520\n It's kind of hilarious.\n\n1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:54.320\n Every conspiracy theory is like Kennedy,\n\n1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:55.160\n something like that,\n\n1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:56.240\n that there's a lot of truth in that,\n\n1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:57.280\n or all truth.\n\n1:15:57.280 --> 1:15:58.280\n But at the end of the day,\n\n1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.280\n it's like you're looking back from 30,000 feet,\n\n1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:02.360\n analyzing little things that have already happened.\n\n1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:03.200\n QAnon's like,\n\n1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.360\n so I think Alex is kind of like got a little tired of\n\n1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:11.040\n the constant evolving nature of that conspiracy theory.\n\n1:16:11.040 --> 1:16:14.040\n So he's not a fan of like the jazz that is QAnon.\n\n1:16:14.040 --> 1:16:14.880\n So they're not,\n\n1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:15.960\n because they're improvising constantly.\n\n1:16:15.960 --> 1:16:16.800\n They're improvising.\n\n1:16:16.800 --> 1:16:17.960\n Alex is like, hey man,\n\n1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:19.320\n I was on board a little bit,\n\n1:16:19.320 --> 1:16:20.240\n but at the end of the day,\n\n1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:21.120\n it's getting a little annoying\n\n1:16:21.120 --> 1:16:22.680\n because it can turn on you.\n\n1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:25.080\n Eventually you become part of the conspiracy.\n\n1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:26.520\n Alex is controlled opposition.\n\n1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:27.800\n That's what they'll say.\n\n1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:29.400\n Eventually you,\n\n1:16:29.400 --> 1:16:31.480\n because QAnon just eats things.\n\n1:16:31.480 --> 1:16:33.320\n So it's a conspiracy that just eats things.\n\n1:16:33.320 --> 1:16:34.160\n The minute you start to say,\n\n1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:35.720\n hey man, maybe that's not,\n\n1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:36.840\n it just eats you and go,\n\n1:16:36.840 --> 1:16:38.200\n well, you're in on it.\n\n1:16:38.200 --> 1:16:39.040\n Everyone's in on it.\n\n1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:40.200\n Everyone's a satanic pedophile.\n\n1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:41.040\n Everybody.\n\n1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:43.640\n Everyone that questions it is eating children.\n\n1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:45.160\n And you go, wait a minute,\n\n1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:46.920\n that seems illogical.\n\n1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:48.280\n But now there's not enough children.\n\n1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:49.600\n Now there's not enough.\n\n1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:52.200\n And I think QAnon's over now, unfortunately,\n\n1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:54.560\n because for these people,\n\n1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:56.000\n but I think fortunately for them,\n\n1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:57.520\n they're gonna have to find a new hobby.\n\n1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:58.440\n But I think it's over now\n\n1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.920\n because even the best QAnon people now are starting to go,\n\n1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:03.760\n hey man, this might not be going down the way we thought.\n\n1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:05.400\n But they've literally gone as far as to say\n\n1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:07.880\n that like Biden and Trump switched faces.\n\n1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:10.600\n Trump's actually still the president except Biden.\n\n1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:12.840\n You have to be a real moron now.\n\n1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:16.200\n You gotta be real stupid now.\n\n1:17:16.200 --> 1:17:17.120\n It's at the end.\n\n1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:19.680\n Like it was cool when the Epstein stuff happened,\n\n1:17:19.680 --> 1:17:22.920\n QAnon was like, it was party at Q.\n\n1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:24.760\n And then when the Hunter Biden laptop stuff\n\n1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:26.800\n started to happen, they were like dancing,\n\n1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:28.480\n like it's time.\n\n1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:33.480\n And then Biden wins and they're like, wait, whoa.\n\n1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:36.680\n And it's just like, it's the day after the party.\n\n1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:38.520\n QAnon, if you ever went to a party in high school\n\n1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:40.840\n or college, QAnon right now is the day after the party.\n\n1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:43.560\n You wake up, it's 12 noon.\n\n1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:44.640\n The sun is hitting you in the face.\n\n1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:45.480\n You're hung over.\n\n1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.760\n There's a stench of disgusting beer and cigarettes\n\n1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:48.600\n all over the house.\n\n1:17:48.600 --> 1:17:50.840\n You're like, what the fuck happened here?\n\n1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.640\n I gotta get out of here and get a bacon, egg and cheese.\n\n1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:55.080\n That's what QAnon is.\n\n1:17:55.080 --> 1:17:57.040\n They gotta sober up, get out of that house,\n\n1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:58.680\n get a bacon, egg and cheese and go, man,\n\n1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:00.840\n we were fucking whacked.\n\n1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:02.120\n We were high, dude.\n\n1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:05.200\n I thought Nancy Pelosi was eating children for four years\n\n1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:08.400\n and that Donald Trump was gonna put her in Guantanamo Bay.\n\n1:18:08.400 --> 1:18:12.080\n Wow, that was, cause I mean, it's interesting.\n\n1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:14.000\n People had to do that after the sixties.\n\n1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:15.960\n They were like, yeah, I just did a bunch of acid\n\n1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:17.400\n and I lived in a ranch in Malibu\n\n1:18:17.400 --> 1:18:19.960\n and fucked everyone I ever saw.\n\n1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:21.520\n And they're like, I thought that was the way\n\n1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:25.000\n the world was gonna go and I followed some shaman guy,\n\n1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:26.680\n some guru who just wanted to fuck me\n\n1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:28.760\n and 10 other people that were living there.\n\n1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:30.520\n And we did that for three years.\n\n1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:32.440\n Apparently we never created the utopia\n\n1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:33.640\n we thought we were gonna have.\n\n1:18:33.640 --> 1:18:37.240\n And now I'm back working here at Allstate Insurance\n\n1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.640\n and we have great policies and we'd love you\n\n1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:42.080\n to come in the office so we can break them down for you.\n\n1:18:42.080 --> 1:18:45.760\n It all ends folks, all the love, all the bullshit ends,\n\n1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:47.960\n but it's fun, they have so much fun.\n\n1:18:47.960 --> 1:18:50.800\n QAnon was hard to get mad at because they were,\n\n1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:53.320\n this was all they had.\n\n1:18:53.320 --> 1:18:56.760\n Yeah, and they were quite good at it.\n\n1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:59.720\n And they were good at it and it was a lot\n\n1:18:59.720 --> 1:19:02.800\n of desperate people, but they were also rich idiots.\n\n1:19:02.800 --> 1:19:04.600\n There's also like dumb rich people\n\n1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:08.000\n and those are like the saddest people in Q\n\n1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.160\n cause it's like they should,\n\n1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:11.400\n they have the resources to do other things,\n\n1:19:11.400 --> 1:19:13.080\n but they just love Q.\n\n1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:14.880\n They're like, I'm just into this.\n\n1:19:14.880 --> 1:19:18.640\n And I'm like, you're rich, go do something.\n\n1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.200\n How in curious are you?\n\n1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:23.080\n Go to the Amazon, go bird walk.\n\n1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:25.000\n I don't know, but they're, you know, so.\n\n1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:25.840\n Play golf.\n\n1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:26.960\n It's sad, but they're like done now.\n\n1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:29.120\n I mean, it's over.\n\n1:19:29.120 --> 1:19:31.040\n I see you think this is the.\n\n1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:31.920\n I think everything's ending.\n\n1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:34.720\n My whole thing is that Trump's out, QAnon's over,\n\n1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:35.920\n the quarantine is gonna end.\n\n1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:37.760\n Everything's gonna go back\n\n1:19:37.760 --> 1:19:40.560\n to something that's more recognizable.\n\n1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:42.200\n I think that.\n\n1:19:42.200 --> 1:19:44.840\n Are you optimistic about the 2021 and what.\n\n1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:48.600\n To a degree in certain aspects, I have optimism.\n\n1:19:48.600 --> 1:19:50.920\n And then I have, I have short term optimism\n\n1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:52.720\n and longterm pessimism.\n\n1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:54.200\n Meaning that I think in the short term,\n\n1:19:54.200 --> 1:19:55.240\n things can get better.\n\n1:19:55.240 --> 1:19:57.440\n I think longterm, because there's so many forces\n\n1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:59.280\n that are out of our control that are evolving\n\n1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.880\n in ways I barely understand that are carving up society.\n\n1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:04.760\n It's gonna be very tough longterm\n\n1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:07.080\n to be completely optimistic.\n\n1:20:07.080 --> 1:20:08.040\n Like, Hey, it's gonna be great.\n\n1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:09.400\n It's gonna be good forever.\n\n1:20:09.400 --> 1:20:12.000\n But short term, I think, yeah, this quarantine will end.\n\n1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:12.840\n Things will get better.\n\n1:20:12.840 --> 1:20:14.600\n The economy will get a little better.\n\n1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:18.600\n The constant Trump craziness will die down a little bit.\n\n1:20:18.600 --> 1:20:19.480\n That's my hope.\n\n1:20:19.480 --> 1:20:22.200\n And people can go back to focusing on things that matter,\n\n1:20:22.200 --> 1:20:26.040\n which is the things that are near you and close to you.\n\n1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:27.280\n Yeah, the humans around you.\n\n1:20:27.280 --> 1:20:30.480\n Humans around you, not Nancy Pelosi.\n\n1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:32.280\n I have uncles that talk about Nancy Pelosi.\n\n1:20:32.280 --> 1:20:33.840\n I'm like, you've never met her.\n\n1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.400\n You'll never meet her, shut up.\n\n1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:40.960\n And I have a belief that this kind of local love\n\n1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:42.960\n and kindness that you naturally can have\n\n1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:45.320\n for human beings that you actually know\n\n1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:49.320\n can be expanded at scale through the social networks\n\n1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:52.120\n that we use, that we build.\n\n1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:54.560\n Twitter is currently failing at that miserably.\n\n1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:55.400\n That would be great.\n\n1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:56.240\n But that's...\n\n1:20:56.240 --> 1:20:58.720\n If we were able to increase the love\n\n1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:00.920\n through the social networks, that would be great.\n\n1:21:00.920 --> 1:21:02.560\n It feels very hard to.\n\n1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:04.880\n It's a worthy challenge.\n\n1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:08.120\n You've tweeted, one of the underreported reasons\n\n1:21:08.120 --> 1:21:10.080\n conspiracy theories take hold\n\n1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:11.760\n is because some of them are true.\n\n1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:17.400\n What conspiracy theories do you believe\n\n1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:22.400\n that are sort of important for people to think about,\n\n1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:23.400\n would you say?\n\n1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:27.280\n Kennedy was not killed by a lone gunman\n\n1:21:27.280 --> 1:21:31.200\n with no connections to any other situation, government.\n\n1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.720\n I believe that JFK was removed from office\n\n1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:39.720\n by a group of people that had very different interests.\n\n1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:41.360\n But...\n\n1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:42.200\n This is the question of like deep state.\n\n1:21:42.200 --> 1:21:45.080\n So these are powerful people that are able now\n\n1:21:45.080 --> 1:21:49.680\n to dictate through basically the threat of violence\n\n1:21:49.680 --> 1:21:51.760\n what the presidents,\n\n1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:53.560\n the surface powerful people in our society.\n\n1:21:53.560 --> 1:21:55.360\n Yeah, I mean, again, I'm not...\n\n1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:58.160\n I want another investigation into 9 11,\n\n1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:00.360\n not because I think that George Bush pressed a button\n\n1:22:00.360 --> 1:22:01.400\n and made 9 11 happen,\n\n1:22:01.400 --> 1:22:03.680\n but because we invaded the country of Iraq.\n\n1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:08.680\n And then we, 15 out of 19 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia.\n\n1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:10.840\n There was tons of stuff in the 9 11 report\n\n1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:12.880\n that didn't make sense to anybody.\n\n1:22:12.880 --> 1:22:14.600\n There's tons of stuff about that day\n\n1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:16.360\n that I feel like we just don't know.\n\n1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:17.200\n Yeah, that's...\n\n1:22:17.200 --> 1:22:18.400\n Sorry to interrupt.\n\n1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:21.920\n That's when I, my little aunt life\n\n1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:23.920\n touched upon conspiracy theory world\n\n1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:27.800\n and first learned about Alex Jones is when 9 11 happened.\n\n1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:30.400\n It was very frustrating to me\n\n1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:33.000\n how poorly the reporting and the transparency\n\n1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.960\n around what exactly happened, who knew what,\n\n1:22:35.960 --> 1:22:37.480\n all that kind of a basic information\n\n1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:42.360\n that you would hope the government would release, reveal,\n\n1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:45.920\n and use as like a lesson for how we prevent this.\n\n1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:48.920\n Instead, it felt like a lot of stuff was being hidden\n\n1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:51.480\n in order to manipulate some kind of machine\n\n1:22:51.480 --> 1:22:52.800\n that leads us to war.\n\n1:22:52.800 --> 1:22:54.760\n Yeah, that's fair to say.\n\n1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.240\n Yeah, I mean, I just don't feel like\n\n1:22:56.240 --> 1:22:57.360\n we've gotten the full story.\n\n1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:58.520\n I don't know what the full story is.\n\n1:22:58.520 --> 1:23:00.320\n I can't, I don't know what it is,\n\n1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:02.920\n but I don't feel like we've gotten the full story.\n\n1:23:02.920 --> 1:23:06.280\n Yeah, there are groups of powerful pedophiles, right?\n\n1:23:06.280 --> 1:23:07.440\n Whether they're in the Catholic church\n\n1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:08.960\n or they're in the government or wherever they are,\n\n1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:11.160\n they are able to cover things up that they do.\n\n1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:13.480\n They're able to silence people that try to out them\n\n1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:16.080\n in terms of like, you know, disrupt their operations.\n\n1:23:16.080 --> 1:23:16.920\n That's true.\n\n1:23:16.920 --> 1:23:18.600\n QAnon has nuggets of truth.\n\n1:23:18.600 --> 1:23:20.120\n It just went crazy.\n\n1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:23.160\n Any conspiracy theory that involves the Knights Templar\n\n1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:27.680\n and also Chrissy Teigen is probably wrong, you know?\n\n1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:28.840\n What's the Knights Templar?\n\n1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:32.000\n Well, it was just this group of Knights back in the day.\n\n1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.680\n You know, it's that supposedly secret meetings.\n\n1:23:34.680 --> 1:23:36.760\n And like in every conspiracy, they talk about like,\n\n1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:37.800\n you know, if you go deep enough,\n\n1:23:37.800 --> 1:23:40.800\n it's like the Knights Templar, the Rosicrucians,\n\n1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:43.800\n you know, all of these secret groups throughout history,\n\n1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:45.120\n the Illuminati, the...\n\n1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:46.720\n Oh, and there's a thread that connects all of this.\n\n1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:49.000\n Oh yes, it connects it all to David Spade.\n\n1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:50.520\n I mean, it's a little much.\n\n1:23:50.520 --> 1:23:52.000\n Well, how do you, if you're David Spade,\n\n1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:53.200\n defend yourself, by the way?\n\n1:23:53.200 --> 1:23:54.760\n You ignore it because it's hilarious.\n\n1:23:54.760 --> 1:23:55.680\n And I know David Spade.\n\n1:23:55.680 --> 1:23:57.480\n It's like Hollywood's kind of boring.\n\n1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:58.840\n Yes, there are sex orgies.\n\n1:23:58.840 --> 1:23:59.680\n I'm not invited.\n\n1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:00.920\n I'm sure there's shit going on.\n\n1:24:00.920 --> 1:24:02.800\n Kids do get abused, women get abused.\n\n1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:03.880\n I'll invite you to one.\n\n1:24:03.880 --> 1:24:08.480\n Please, we got the $75,000 dog and then we'll get one.\n\n1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:10.920\n But, you know, me and David Spade,\n\n1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:12.960\n we go out to sushi restaurants, like,\n\n1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:15.320\n and you sit there and you listen to people complain.\n\n1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.920\n That's what a lot of it is.\n\n1:24:16.920 --> 1:24:20.160\n What a lot of Hollywood is is deeply sad tragedy\n\n1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:23.560\n that people don't understand that some of it is nefarious\n\n1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:24.960\n and dark and there are problems\n\n1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:26.720\n and there are real power brokers here.\n\n1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:29.200\n It's a dark town, 100%.\n\n1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:31.120\n But the idea that everybody that lives here\n\n1:24:31.120 --> 1:24:34.680\n is in some wide ranging vast conspiracy isn't true.\n\n1:24:34.680 --> 1:24:39.520\n It ignores how humdrum, boring, deeply sad\n\n1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:41.440\n most people's lives are in Hollywood.\n\n1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:44.320\n And it ignores how sad fame is in general.\n\n1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:46.000\n Fame's a sad thing.\n\n1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:49.240\n Not always, but a lot of times it's a sad thing.\n\n1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:52.280\n It's fleeting, it's ephemeral, it doesn't last.\n\n1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:55.480\n It separates you from other people.\n\n1:24:55.480 --> 1:24:57.360\n It's isolating.\n\n1:24:57.360 --> 1:24:59.800\n It can be traumatic depending on what's going on.\n\n1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:01.640\n Obviously it's better than the alternative.\n\n1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.000\n If you're trying to be famous,\n\n1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.360\n it's better to be famous than not famous, right?\n\n1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:06.560\n I'll say that.\n\n1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:09.240\n But it's a mixed bag to a degree.\n\n1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:11.440\n There are things about it that aren't great.\n\n1:25:11.440 --> 1:25:14.040\n And Hollywood has a deep undercurrent of sadness\n\n1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.200\n of people that have not realized their dreams\n\n1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:18.640\n and people that have realized them.\n\n1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:21.240\n Both of those people.\n\n1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:23.000\n The people that win Olympic gold medals\n\n1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.760\n can sometimes suffer from depression.\n\n1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:25.600\n Correct.\n\n1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:26.420\n They've lost.\n\n1:25:26.420 --> 1:25:28.040\n Well, somebody said, and I forget who said it,\n\n1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:29.680\n it's a great quote, it's not mine.\n\n1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:31.960\n I think it's from a book, or it might be from a TV show.\n\n1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:33.360\n Sometimes I quote something and they're like,\n\n1:25:33.360 --> 1:25:35.000\n \"'That's from like, Charlotte's Web.\"\n\n1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:36.600\n I'm like, oh.\n\n1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:37.420\n The two worst things are,\n\n1:25:37.420 --> 1:25:39.280\n oh, I think it's from the movie Limitless.\n\n1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:40.240\n I'm like an idiot.\n\n1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.620\n But anyway, thanks for having me on.\n\n1:25:42.620 --> 1:25:43.460\n Tomorrow you're gonna make some genius.\n\n1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.280\n I will not publish this.\n\n1:25:46.600 --> 1:25:48.480\n It's from the movie, and I think he says,\n\n1:25:48.480 --> 1:25:50.520\n \"'The two worst things in the world are not good.\"\n\n1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:52.440\n Oh, you know what's not from Limitless?\n\n1:25:52.440 --> 1:25:55.880\n I think it's from the movie\n\n1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:58.000\n where Nicolas Cage sold weapons.\n\n1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.280\n It was called Lord of War.\n\n1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:00.480\n It's a little better than Limitless.\n\n1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:01.600\n Anyway. That's a good movie.\n\n1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:02.440\n It's a great movie.\n\n1:26:02.440 --> 1:26:03.960\n He said, the two worst things in the world\n\n1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:06.360\n are not getting what you want and getting it.\n\n1:26:06.360 --> 1:26:07.600\n So the undercurrents of sadness\n\n1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:09.000\n that run through Hollywood are,\n\n1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:10.720\n there are two rivers that converge,\n\n1:26:10.720 --> 1:26:12.520\n and there are people that just never had it,\n\n1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:14.520\n and people that have it and go, now what?\n\n1:26:14.520 --> 1:26:16.040\n And so it's a sad place, a tragic place.\n\n1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:17.840\n And there's a lot of, it's boring.\n\n1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:19.440\n That's what people don't realize is like,\n\n1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:20.840\n it's actually kind of boring.\n\n1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:21.960\n Well, life is kind of boring.\n\n1:26:21.960 --> 1:26:22.960\n Life is kind of boring.\n\n1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.440\n But there's also like, you know,\n\n1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:26.840\n so I think QAnon's this way to make a lot of it seem like\n\n1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:28.440\n it's super exciting.\n\n1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:30.680\n And listen, I don't want to diminish the experiences\n\n1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:31.520\n of people who've been abused here,\n\n1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:33.240\n because there is a lot of horror here.\n\n1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:34.680\n But the whole QAnon thing was like,\n\n1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:38.000\n everybody in everything is doing, and that's not true.\n\n1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:41.640\n Well, see, just to linger on that a little bit is,\n\n1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:45.040\n Bill Gates, the conspiracy theories around Bill Gates\n\n1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:50.040\n bother me because, this is me, dumb, naive Lex,\n\n1:26:50.920 --> 1:26:53.680\n thinks that Bill Gates did a lot of good for this world.\n\n1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:54.520\n Sure.\n\n1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:56.560\n First, by creating a company\n\n1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:58.840\n that empowered personal computers.\n\n1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:01.480\n And second, by donating a ton of money\n\n1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:04.600\n for like treating malaria in Africa\n\n1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:06.320\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.160\n And there's these huge amounts of conspiracies, I think,\n\n1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:12.480\n based on like just replies to whenever\n\n1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.480\n Bill Gates does anything.\n\n1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:19.000\n Like, to me, the top replies should be about\n\n1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:22.520\n how inspiring that guy is, to donate so much money.\n\n1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:27.520\n And so sorry to, the thing I'm struggling with is,\n\n1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:32.080\n if I'm Bill Gates, like, how do you behave differently?\n\n1:27:32.080 --> 1:27:34.800\n How do you show people that you're, if you're not,\n\n1:27:34.800 --> 1:27:36.640\n I don't know, doing creepy stuff\n\n1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:38.200\n that they're saying he's doing?\n\n1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:39.920\n Well, I think part of it is that\n\n1:27:39.920 --> 1:27:42.320\n he's done some really good stuff, right?\n\n1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:43.960\n He's an innovative guy, he's on the vanguard\n\n1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:47.200\n of a lot of things, but he's also the antichrist.\n\n1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:49.360\n And I think that that is, you know,\n\n1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:51.400\n they're not mutually exclusive.\n\n1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:54.920\n He is the prince of darkness, as well as some, no.\n\n1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:55.960\n Here's my deal with Bill Gates.\n\n1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.320\n He's a Batman villain billionaire,\n\n1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:58.440\n meaning that he's not a villain,\n\n1:27:58.440 --> 1:27:59.760\n but he's got all this money, right?\n\n1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:01.320\n Here's the thing, and I love Musk and all these guys,\n\n1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:02.480\n I know you love these guys.\n\n1:28:02.480 --> 1:28:04.640\n Listen, when you have the kind of money that these guys have\n\n1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:06.280\n and you have the vision that they have,\n\n1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:08.240\n and they want society to look a certain way,\n\n1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:10.120\n and a lot of them are doing great things,\n\n1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:13.000\n people, they need to get better at the pushback.\n\n1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.200\n They need to get a little better.\n\n1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:16.880\n When somebody says, hey man, what's going on over there?\n\n1:28:16.880 --> 1:28:18.600\n Bill Gates needs to be a little better at going,\n\n1:28:18.600 --> 1:28:23.600\n here's what, because, you know, Bill Gates has the money.\n\n1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:26.280\n You know, I think once he wanted to shoot a missile\n\n1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:28.640\n of dust at the atmosphere to help global warming,\n\n1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:29.640\n and a lot of scientists were like,\n\n1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:31.240\n hey man, that might not be the way to do it.\n\n1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:33.280\n But no one in history, like so few people in history\n\n1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:35.560\n have had the resources to even have that thought,\n\n1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.080\n that if you have the resources to have that thought,\n\n1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:39.120\n and you have designs on the way you want society to look,\n\n1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:41.760\n whether it's public health policy or vaccinations,\n\n1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.440\n whatever, you have to get a little better\n\n1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:46.680\n at dealing with legitimate critiques.\n\n1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:48.200\n And obviously you're not defending yourself\n\n1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:49.720\n against people that say you're the Antichrist,\n\n1:28:49.720 --> 1:28:51.680\n but like, you need to get a little better.\n\n1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:53.800\n And I feel like Bill Gates and some of those people\n\n1:28:53.800 --> 1:28:57.800\n at that level are like, ugh, PR is kind of like, you know.\n\n1:28:57.800 --> 1:28:58.640\n They're terrible at it.\n\n1:28:58.640 --> 1:28:59.480\n They're terrible at it.\n\n1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:00.320\n They're terrible at it.\n\n1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:01.520\n Him and Zuckerberg are really bad at it.\n\n1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:02.680\n Zuckerberg's horrible at it.\n\n1:29:02.680 --> 1:29:07.160\n He seems especially bad at public.\n\n1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:10.000\n Yeah, and it makes me feel so bad\n\n1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:13.200\n because the problem with being a billionaire\n\n1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:16.520\n is you lose touch with reality if you're not careful.\n\n1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:20.400\n I think Elon is good at, at least so far,\n\n1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:22.240\n maintaining touch with reality.\n\n1:29:22.240 --> 1:29:24.320\n No, if you look at the name of his child,\n\n1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:25.720\n you can clearly see.\n\n1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:27.160\n Listen, I do like him,\n\n1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:29.000\n and I do think what he's done with Tesla,\n\n1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:30.360\n you know, my producer has a Tesla,\n\n1:29:30.360 --> 1:29:31.640\n and he never shuts up about it.\n\n1:29:31.640 --> 1:29:34.120\n Most people that have Teslas never shut up about them,\n\n1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:36.480\n and they think they're part of the development team\n\n1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:39.880\n at SpaceX, and I like that he's created a world\n\n1:29:39.880 --> 1:29:43.160\n where people can get excited about a $37,000 car\n\n1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:44.920\n and never shut the fuck up about it\n\n1:29:44.920 --> 1:29:46.560\n to the point where I have to threaten people\n\n1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:49.200\n with physical violence to get them to stop telling me\n\n1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:50.840\n about that their car drives itself.\n\n1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:51.680\n Oh, you should get a Tesla.\n\n1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:54.760\n Maybe have a few less drinks and a few fewer Vicodin,\n\n1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:55.920\n and you can drive yourself.\n\n1:29:55.920 --> 1:29:57.040\n Have you thought about getting a Tesla?\n\n1:29:57.040 --> 1:29:57.880\n I've never thought about it.\n\n1:29:57.880 --> 1:29:58.720\n You should get a Tesla.\n\n1:29:58.720 --> 1:29:59.640\n I don't like them, they're minimalist.\n\n1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:02.080\n I don't like, I want more.\n\n1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:03.120\n I want more.\n\n1:30:03.120 --> 1:30:04.040\n Get the Cybertruck.\n\n1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:04.880\n I want a Cybertruck.\n\n1:30:04.880 --> 1:30:07.680\n I'm just being a, trolling you by being a salesman.\n\n1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:09.120\n My producer wants a Cybertruck.\n\n1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:10.760\n I want a stagecoach.\n\n1:30:10.760 --> 1:30:15.120\n Old school, stagecoach, horse thief shit.\n\n1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:16.920\n It's going back to that.\n\n1:30:16.920 --> 1:30:18.240\n I live in an area with a lot of horses.\n\n1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:20.520\n It's going back to like whipping a horse.\n\n1:30:20.520 --> 1:30:22.920\n I want an animal to shriek while I go by.\n\n1:30:22.920 --> 1:30:27.640\n You want more suffering in the world, not less.\n\n1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:28.840\n Oh, I think we need it.\n\n1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:33.440\n Okay, but I just don't like that billionaire is a bad word.\n\n1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:35.080\n And it's not necessarily,\n\n1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:37.120\n not every billionaire is a pedophile.\n\n1:30:37.120 --> 1:30:39.840\n I know, but the problem is a lot of like,\n\n1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:41.760\n it's just, you know, Epstein was very smart\n\n1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:43.240\n at like just getting people at that house\n\n1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:44.960\n and taking photos of them.\n\n1:30:44.960 --> 1:30:46.000\n Nobody knew what they were doing,\n\n1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.840\n but it's like, it was one of those things where it's like,\n\n1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:49.240\n Epstein was the most social guy ever.\n\n1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:51.560\n Like every photo he's like, hey,\n\n1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:54.720\n and it's like everyone that's ever done anything\n\n1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:57.120\n in the world has been at that fucking island.\n\n1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:59.480\n Every human being is like in a photo.\n\n1:30:59.480 --> 1:31:00.640\n It's just weird, like I'm in,\n\n1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:02.200\n like it's funny me and my friends get together.\n\n1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:04.080\n We don't ever take photos, right?\n\n1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:05.520\n Like last night, a few people,\n\n1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:07.840\n it was my birthday yesterday, I'm 17.\n\n1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:11.640\n And my friends came over and we're just eating dinner, right?\n\n1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:12.480\n And we had a fun night,\n\n1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:14.600\n and just four people that are over, nobody, right?\n\n1:31:14.600 --> 1:31:18.040\n Nobody ever thought like, let's, hey, I wanna remember it.\n\n1:31:18.040 --> 1:31:21.920\n Let's take photos, I'm 36, woo!\n\n1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:23.480\n But everything Epstein did,\n\n1:31:23.480 --> 1:31:26.480\n there's just photos of everybody, it's interesting.\n\n1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:29.240\n Do you think Jeffrey Epstein killed himself?\n\n1:31:29.240 --> 1:31:32.360\n No, I think he was killed by that guy,\n\n1:31:32.360 --> 1:31:37.000\n that guy that they put in his cell, that lunatic,\n\n1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.120\n who was that big muscled guy.\n\n1:31:38.120 --> 1:31:40.280\n I think he was just, he did it for money,\n\n1:31:40.280 --> 1:31:41.280\n kept his mouth shut.\n\n1:31:41.280 --> 1:31:42.120\n That's it.\n\n1:31:42.120 --> 1:31:43.560\n Money from whom do you think?\n\n1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:47.200\n Mossad, MI6, CIA, all three.\n\n1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:48.280\n So there's a lot of pressure\n\n1:31:48.280 --> 1:31:49.920\n from a lot of different powerful people.\n\n1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:51.800\n Probably Mossad, CIA more.\n\n1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.240\n I mean, it seems very clear that he was working\n\n1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:57.800\n inside of a honeypot intelligence operation.\n\n1:31:57.800 --> 1:32:01.120\n Ghislaine Maxwell's father was an Israeli super spy.\n\n1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:03.440\n Ghislaine Maxwell's working for Israeli intelligence.\n\n1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:04.640\n It would be odd to think,\n\n1:32:04.640 --> 1:32:06.360\n and of course the CIA knows about everything\n\n1:32:06.360 --> 1:32:08.920\n that Israeli intelligence is doing with Americans.\n\n1:32:08.920 --> 1:32:12.000\n So I would think that it's a very cozy relationship\n\n1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:13.880\n with those two intelligence agencies.\n\n1:32:13.880 --> 1:32:15.800\n And I think if you ran it by anyone,\n\n1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:17.200\n I think if you ran it by French intelligence,\n\n1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:19.560\n they'd go, yeah, no, get him.\n\n1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.080\n I don't think there was any intelligence service\n\n1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:23.560\n in the world whose job is to protect the powerful people\n\n1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:24.520\n that live in their countries\n\n1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:27.040\n that was against him getting whacked.\n\n1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:30.000\n But do you think it's possible that he's just an evil person\n\n1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.840\n who is after manipulating people and also was a pedophile?\n\n1:32:33.840 --> 1:32:36.400\n So that there's a bigger thing.\n\n1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:37.880\n It's not factual that there's a bigger thing.\n\n1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:39.120\n Evil people don't get handed.\n\n1:32:39.120 --> 1:32:40.800\n Those are your facts, Tim Dillon.\n\n1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:42.600\n No, there's the facts of the case.\n\n1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:44.280\n You don't get handed a 65.\n\n1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:45.560\n Show me another evil guy\n\n1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:50.440\n who was handed a $65 million place by Les Wexner.\n\n1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:51.960\n Show me another evil guy\n\n1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:55.120\n that got that type of a handshake deal\n\n1:32:55.120 --> 1:32:58.480\n where he was basically let off without anything\n\n1:32:58.480 --> 1:33:02.920\n after a judge had made a very sweetheart deal for him\n\n1:33:02.920 --> 1:33:06.240\n after he was accused of molesting a 14 year old.\n\n1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:07.680\n Show me another evil guy\n\n1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:10.200\n that doesn't have that kind of backing\n\n1:33:10.200 --> 1:33:12.360\n that has those types of friends, those connections,\n\n1:33:12.360 --> 1:33:13.640\n those types of properties.\n\n1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:16.880\n Show me multiple passports all over the world.\n\n1:33:16.880 --> 1:33:20.400\n So show me a guy without anyone backing him that's doing it.\n\n1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:23.160\n Why did they, so you think he's just an evil guy\n\n1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:26.960\n who is doing this for whom is his own just shits and giggles.\n\n1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:28.320\n He's just getting off on it.\n\n1:33:28.320 --> 1:33:29.280\n Human nature, yeah.\n\n1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:30.360\n Human nature, huh?\n\n1:33:30.360 --> 1:33:31.320\n It's human nature.\n\n1:33:31.320 --> 1:33:33.360\n $70 million limestone mansion.\n\n1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:34.760\n I'm being visibly mocked.\n\n1:33:34.760 --> 1:33:36.240\n Yeah, is it human nature?\n\n1:33:36.240 --> 1:33:37.600\n And it's like poetry.\n\n1:33:37.600 --> 1:33:38.840\n I don't think it's human nature.\n\n1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:41.800\n I think they manipulated human nature,\n\n1:33:41.800 --> 1:33:43.520\n but I think they did it.\n\n1:33:43.520 --> 1:33:44.360\n I think JustLane,\n\n1:33:44.360 --> 1:33:46.360\n I think Epstein was really just a functionary\n\n1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:48.840\n and I think JustLane was kind of a pimp\n\n1:33:48.840 --> 1:33:52.080\n and Epstein was kind of a guy that made the money okay\n\n1:33:52.080 --> 1:33:54.280\n and hid money and things like that\n\n1:33:54.280 --> 1:33:56.160\n and worked for a lot of powerful people.\n\n1:33:56.160 --> 1:34:00.040\n I don't believe in lone pedophiles anymore.\n\n1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:01.040\n I don't even believe that.\n\n1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:03.880\n If you're a pedophile, you're like in a group.\n\n1:34:03.880 --> 1:34:05.080\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:34:07.200 --> 1:34:09.440\n Well, I'm not even going there,\n\n1:34:09.440 --> 1:34:11.160\n but staying on JustLane,\n\n1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.040\n so you believe there's some power in her.\n\n1:34:13.040 --> 1:34:15.360\n What do you think happens to her now?\n\n1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:16.640\n Like what are the differences?\n\n1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:17.480\n Great question.\n\n1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:19.880\n I mean, I don't know what'll happen to her,\n\n1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:22.880\n but I imagine she'll get some type of deal,\n\n1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:24.920\n closed door thing years from now\n\n1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:26.840\n when people don't really care about the case\n\n1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:30.360\n and she'll serve some time in a very lax thing\n\n1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:31.280\n or she'll be killed.\n\n1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:33.720\n I mean, again, it's like if she was doing\n\n1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:36.160\n what she was doing, which is I believe a fact\n\n1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:38.600\n that she was compromising powerful people\n\n1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:40.200\n so that they could be blackmailed\n\n1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:45.200\n by the intelligence services of the US and Israel,\n\n1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:51.080\n probably, I don't see how she wasn't doing that.\n\n1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:53.880\n Someone's black, someone's using the photos\n\n1:34:53.880 --> 1:34:55.000\n and the tapes, right?\n\n1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.640\n Someone's using that against these people.\n\n1:34:57.640 --> 1:34:59.280\n Someone wants to control these people.\n\n1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:00.680\n Well, who and why?\n\n1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:02.000\n That's the real question.\n\n1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.560\n And I think the real question is you wanna exert control\n\n1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:09.080\n over congressmen and senators and presidents\n\n1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:11.920\n because they have the power to make decisions\n\n1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:13.720\n to affect the, but the CIA just works\n\n1:35:13.720 --> 1:35:15.920\n for a lot of very wealthy people.\n\n1:35:15.920 --> 1:35:18.600\n That's what the CIA, so how the CIA started, right?\n\n1:35:18.600 --> 1:35:19.880\n It was lawyers, bankers.\n\n1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.160\n They're protecting financial interests\n\n1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:25.080\n of multinational corporations all over the world,\n\n1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:27.560\n overthrowing democratically elected governments,\n\n1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:29.400\n going in and doing subterfuge campaigns,\n\n1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:30.240\n encouraging terror.\n\n1:35:30.240 --> 1:35:31.840\n They were doing all kinds of crazy stuff.\n\n1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:33.280\n I don't see why that would change.\n\n1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:34.840\n I think that's who they still represent.\n\n1:35:34.840 --> 1:35:38.440\n And I think those people want certain policies\n\n1:35:38.440 --> 1:35:40.080\n and certain people pushed forward.\n\n1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:42.080\n And I think those people are controlled.\n\n1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:44.040\n And I think one of the ways to control people\n\n1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:46.480\n is their sexual problems.\n\n1:35:46.480 --> 1:35:48.120\n And that's the way they did it.\n\n1:35:49.440 --> 1:35:51.800\n I wish there was a way to,\n\n1:35:51.800 --> 1:35:54.440\n because everything you just said now is.\n\n1:35:54.440 --> 1:35:56.320\n It makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?\n\n1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:59.840\n I'm being indoctrinated on air.\n\n1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:00.680\n No.\n\n1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:01.520\n You think there's just a,\n\n1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:03.560\n Jeff Ramsey is just a fun, random guy\n\n1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:06.520\n who just wanted to make home movies of presidents?\n\n1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:09.720\n Well, you think I'm just some random guy.\n\n1:36:09.720 --> 1:36:11.880\n I'm just trying to sell myself as somebody\n\n1:36:11.880 --> 1:36:14.240\n who's friendly with the American audience.\n\n1:36:14.240 --> 1:36:16.440\n I believe you are backed by people\n\n1:36:16.440 --> 1:36:19.520\n that want people to be more comfortable with robot dogs.\n\n1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:21.360\n I believe that.\n\n1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:23.760\n I believe you're pushed to be the happy face of AI.\n\n1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:24.600\n Which is why I will edit this part.\n\n1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:26.160\n They shouldn't pick the happier face.\n\n1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:27.000\n Wow.\n\n1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:28.960\n No editing.\n\n1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:30.800\n Joe Rogan's rule, no editing.\n\n1:36:30.800 --> 1:36:31.880\n This is live.\n\n1:36:31.880 --> 1:36:33.760\n No, I mean, I wish there was a way to,\n\n1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:35.280\n for some of the conspiracy theories,\n\n1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:37.160\n to prove that that's not the case.\n\n1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:39.800\n Like what the CIA is.\n\n1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:42.600\n There is some possibility in my mind\n\n1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:45.360\n that institutions like the CIA\n\n1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:47.720\n and different kinds of organizations\n\n1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:52.720\n are driven less by organized malevolence\n\n1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.840\n and more by just incompetence.\n\n1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:56.760\n Just bureaucracy, being incompetent.\n\n1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:00.480\n I think that argument gets less and less persuasive\n\n1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:03.120\n when you look at all the things they've been able to do.\n\n1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:06.120\n It's very certain, just like you said,\n\n1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:08.520\n that there's a bunch of them that have done,\n\n1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:11.080\n because there's some conspiracy theories\n\n1:37:11.080 --> 1:37:14.080\n that are dramatic and true.\n\n1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:17.480\n The question is, I wish there was a way to prove\n\n1:37:17.480 --> 1:37:19.120\n that some of them are not.\n\n1:37:19.120 --> 1:37:20.200\n And it's very difficult,\n\n1:37:20.200 --> 1:37:22.560\n because so much is shrouded in mystery.\n\n1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:24.440\n Like one of the things I'm bothered by\n\n1:37:24.440 --> 1:37:26.760\n is when people accuse other athletes\n\n1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:28.760\n of using steroids, for example.\n\n1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.040\n And it's just, yes, a lot of people use steroids,\n\n1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:34.600\n but it sucks that people just don't believe you.\n\n1:37:35.560 --> 1:37:37.840\n There's some incredible athletes that look shredded,\n\n1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:40.400\n that look just incredible performers,\n\n1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:43.920\n and everybody just says that they're on steroids.\n\n1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:44.760\n They kind of assume.\n\n1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:47.960\n Yeah, I mean, and people accuse me all the time\n\n1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:50.420\n of being on performance enhancing drugs and steroids.\n\n1:37:50.420 --> 1:37:53.320\n And it is hard, but what I remind them is,\n\n1:37:53.320 --> 1:37:58.320\n it's what my appearance is a result of dedication.\n\n1:37:58.880 --> 1:38:02.120\n But no, it's hard work, diet, exercise, dedication.\n\n1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:03.040\n Are you on keto?\n\n1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.360\n I'm on, I'm on keto.\n\n1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:07.600\n I'm doing a version of, you're keto, right?\n\n1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:08.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:11.520\n So I'm doing a version of keto right now with Brad.\n\n1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:13.200\n And it's, do you see what I mean?\n\n1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:15.280\n You carb up in order to be able.\n\n1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:16.120\n So it's keto with sugar.\n\n1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:18.160\n It's called keto plus sugar.\n\n1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:21.160\n And it's a good diet for,\n\n1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:23.720\n I grew up in the 90s when nobody ever lost weight sadly,\n\n1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:25.560\n because every diet was like,\n\n1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:28.240\n you can eat what you want, just be accountable.\n\n1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:30.000\n No one even knew what that meant.\n\n1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.480\n So it would be like my mother being like,\n\n1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.640\n if you have chocolate chip pancakes, have a glass of water.\n\n1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:37.900\n Just take a walk around the block.\n\n1:38:37.900 --> 1:38:40.040\n You can go to McDonald's three times a day.\n\n1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:41.040\n Just walk around the block.\n\n1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:42.080\n It's what my parents used to say.\n\n1:38:42.080 --> 1:38:44.560\n My mother would be like, just walk around the block.\n\n1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:45.500\n You're fine.\n\n1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:47.680\n Gonna have a cigarette?\n\n1:38:47.680 --> 1:38:50.000\n Walk 20 steps, walk 20 steps back.\n\n1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:51.400\n It's exercise.\n\n1:38:51.400 --> 1:38:54.480\n So, you know, there's too many conspiracies out there.\n\n1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:55.320\n A lot of them aren't true.\n\n1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:56.640\n A lot of them are bitter, angry people\n\n1:38:56.640 --> 1:38:59.800\n trying to justify their own impotence,\n\n1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:01.260\n not being able to do anything in life.\n\n1:39:01.260 --> 1:39:02.100\n And they're like the people\n\n1:39:02.100 --> 1:39:04.160\n that have done something in life, they're all nefarious.\n\n1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:05.960\n It's all, the car just attacked against me.\n\n1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:08.660\n That's 100% true, 100%.\n\n1:39:08.660 --> 1:39:11.000\n It attracts usually people\n\n1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:14.520\n that have not figured out a way to succeed\n\n1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:17.640\n or haven't succeeded on the level that they want to.\n\n1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:21.120\n But that also being true,\n\n1:39:21.120 --> 1:39:25.560\n there is a fair amount of fuckery going on and provable.\n\n1:39:25.560 --> 1:39:28.920\n And, you know, we just have to, I think, separate,\n\n1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.520\n know that these things are often inflated or not true,\n\n1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:36.160\n but know that sometimes they are true.\n\n1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:37.920\n Otherwise it wouldn't exist.\n\n1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:41.120\n If there was no, if there was nothing to JFK,\n\n1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:42.640\n there was nothing to 9 11,\n\n1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:46.520\n if people felt like they were being dealt with honestly,\n\n1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:47.720\n this wouldn't exist.\n\n1:39:47.720 --> 1:39:50.840\n I mean, this exists because there are real questions\n\n1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:53.720\n that people have that don't get answered for whatever reason.\n\n1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:57.160\n And then the vacuum of the refusal to answer those questions,\n\n1:39:57.160 --> 1:40:00.120\n that information vacuum is filled with people\n\n1:40:00.120 --> 1:40:02.120\n like Alex Jones, who are curious\n\n1:40:02.120 --> 1:40:03.000\n and sometimes they're right\n\n1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:05.320\n and sometimes they're horribly wrong.\n\n1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:07.120\n And sometimes they're all over the place.\n\n1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:09.100\n And they're good storytellers and people love stories.\n\n1:40:09.100 --> 1:40:11.800\n And then when there's an absence of actual.\n\n1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:13.900\n Alex is a uniquely American person,\n\n1:40:13.900 --> 1:40:15.920\n like a very interesting, I don't know how many countries,\n\n1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:18.240\n like how many people make a living as a conspiracy theorist,\n\n1:40:18.240 --> 1:40:20.120\n a good living in other countries, right?\n\n1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:21.640\n It's very rare, right?\n\n1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:22.560\n I mean, it's very interesting.\n\n1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.400\n And he became like, I know people that knew him\n\n1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:25.240\n when he was a kid,\n\n1:40:25.240 --> 1:40:27.240\n because I'd go to Austin and perform a lot.\n\n1:40:27.240 --> 1:40:29.760\n And he was a guy that would take a bullhorn and yell at cops\n\n1:40:29.760 --> 1:40:32.120\n because he thought DEI checkpoints were unconstitutional.\n\n1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:33.880\n That's what he was doing in college.\n\n1:40:33.880 --> 1:40:35.840\n And he's just went through, he was hated by the right.\n\n1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:37.200\n He was hated by the Bush people.\n\n1:40:37.200 --> 1:40:38.440\n He was hated by them.\n\n1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:41.320\n And he went from being this guy\n\n1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:44.040\n that was considered like a leftist even,\n\n1:40:44.040 --> 1:40:45.640\n like even though he was never a leftist,\n\n1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:48.280\n he was considered this like enemy\n\n1:40:48.280 --> 1:40:50.880\n of mainstream conservatism.\n\n1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:53.960\n Like he was not considered a guy that wasn't a patriot,\n\n1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:55.840\n wasn't this, wasn't that.\n\n1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:58.520\n And he just, wow, like he whines and whines\n\n1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:01.000\n and ends up just being this confidant\n\n1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.520\n of a Republican president,\n\n1:41:02.520 --> 1:41:04.400\n very divisive Republican president.\n\n1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:06.360\n And he becomes this populist and everything like that.\n\n1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:08.060\n It's really wild to watch that.\n\n1:41:08.060 --> 1:41:10.360\n But I mean, I do think he should retire eventually\n\n1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:12.480\n just so we could get some, I don't know,\n\n1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:14.880\n it seems like it's a lot to keep doing.\n\n1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:17.560\n Well, I hope this world allows for Alex Jones\n\n1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:20.560\n to continue having a voice because just like you said,\n\n1:41:20.560 --> 1:41:24.220\n he's a, use the word fun,\n\n1:41:24.220 --> 1:41:28.720\n but really he shakes up the norms of our discourse.\n\n1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:29.560\n I do too.\n\n1:41:29.560 --> 1:41:30.680\n I do think we need to put more value.\n\n1:41:30.680 --> 1:41:33.880\n I think entertainment, we do need to say\n\n1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:35.520\n that like there are people that should be allowed\n\n1:41:35.520 --> 1:41:37.940\n to have a voice for entertainment purposes.\n\n1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:38.780\n Right.\n\n1:41:38.780 --> 1:41:40.920\n And that's part of what Donald Trump,\n\n1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:42.720\n now that he's not the president,\n\n1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:46.120\n come on, let the guy, let him talk.\n\n1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:49.280\n Who do you think is the best comedian of all time?\n\n1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:50.840\n Oh, that's a great question.\n\n1:41:50.840 --> 1:41:53.000\n Greatest of all time.\n\n1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.720\n You mentioned Carlin, your uncle's liking Carlin.\n\n1:41:58.280 --> 1:42:00.640\n Well, Carlin is great.\n\n1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.620\n Carlin is really hard to argue with,\n\n1:42:04.520 --> 1:42:07.320\n but Chappelle is also really great.\n\n1:42:08.900 --> 1:42:11.020\n Louis C.K. is really great.\n\n1:42:11.020 --> 1:42:15.080\n I don't know that there's what Joan Rivers is great.\n\n1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:15.920\n I don't know.\n\n1:42:15.920 --> 1:42:16.740\n You smile at that.\n\n1:42:16.740 --> 1:42:18.280\n Well, she's a beast of a comic.\n\n1:42:18.280 --> 1:42:19.760\n I'm not aware of her standup actually.\n\n1:42:19.760 --> 1:42:20.800\n She's a beast of a comic.\n\n1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:23.200\n Ask Rogue and ask any of them.\n\n1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:24.200\n Kennison's great.\n\n1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:26.960\n So what makes a great comic do you think\n\n1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:29.020\n in the history of comedy?\n\n1:42:29.020 --> 1:42:29.860\n Just like that.\n\n1:42:29.860 --> 1:42:33.000\n Said something at the moment in a way,\n\n1:42:33.880 --> 1:42:35.640\n found a way to communicate with people\n\n1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:38.200\n in the funniest possible way at that moment\n\n1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:43.200\n and illustrated larger truths about life in what they did.\n\n1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.920\n And I think that guys like Louis and Chappelle\n\n1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:50.120\n and Pryor and Kennison and Hicks,\n\n1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:53.160\n people like Joan Rivers have done that.\n\n1:42:53.160 --> 1:42:55.000\n And even modern people,\n\n1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.720\n people like Maria Bamford's an amazing comedian.\n\n1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:00.440\n It's just a different style of comedy per se,\n\n1:43:00.440 --> 1:43:03.000\n but she's an amazing comedian.\n\n1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.520\n Cat Williams is an amazing comedian.\n\n1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:06.360\n He really is.\n\n1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:09.120\n Does he have any, was he the one of the things\n\n1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:11.120\n you kind of mentioned, the communities you mentioned,\n\n1:43:11.120 --> 1:43:12.720\n they were kind of fearless in saying\n\n1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:15.240\n the difficult things that needs to be said.\n\n1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:17.720\n Cat Williams is more, I don't remember his comedy,\n\n1:43:17.720 --> 1:43:20.480\n but I think it's just more wild out there.\n\n1:43:20.480 --> 1:43:21.920\n Well, to an extent that you can watch it.\n\n1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:22.740\n He's got stuff.\n\n1:43:22.740 --> 1:43:23.580\n He talks about stuff.\n\n1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:24.920\n He talks about race brilliantly.\n\n1:43:24.920 --> 1:43:26.600\n He talks about America brilliantly.\n\n1:43:26.600 --> 1:43:28.360\n No, I think there's a lot of stuff there.\n\n1:43:28.360 --> 1:43:29.440\n Of course, Chris Rock.\n\n1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:30.560\n Of Chris Rock, of course.\n\n1:43:30.560 --> 1:43:31.380\n It's so hard.\n\n1:43:31.380 --> 1:43:32.280\n You can't really pick one.\n\n1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:35.040\n You just gotta, there's a class of people\n\n1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:36.980\n that throughout this history of this business,\n\n1:43:36.980 --> 1:43:38.320\n which is not that long of a history.\n\n1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:40.640\n It's pretty much within the last century,\n\n1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:44.720\n that have been really influential.\n\n1:43:44.720 --> 1:43:47.000\n Sometimes it's style, the way they deliver things.\n\n1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:50.760\n Sometimes it's substance of how they, what they're saying,\n\n1:43:50.760 --> 1:43:52.960\n or sometimes it's just a style of what they're saying.\n\n1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:55.160\n And we're only talking about standup comedians, right?\n\n1:43:55.160 --> 1:43:56.920\n So there's a million great comedians.\n\n1:43:56.920 --> 1:43:59.720\n If we're gonna talk about Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler\n\n1:43:59.720 --> 1:44:01.720\n and Chris Farley, these are brilliant.\n\n1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:03.920\n And those guys are bigger influences on comedy,\n\n1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.200\n I think, than standups, really, truly.\n\n1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:09.520\n So there's so many brilliant people in the business.\n\n1:44:09.520 --> 1:44:12.360\n Who was, for you, influential, just early on?\n\n1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:14.300\n Hicks was influential, because I'd watch Bill Hicks,\n\n1:44:14.300 --> 1:44:17.280\n and I'd be like, this guy's saying crazy shit on stage,\n\n1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:18.680\n and this is the only way he can get away with it,\n\n1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:20.160\n is because it's so funny.\n\n1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:23.720\n And he was calling out the military industrial complex,\n\n1:44:23.720 --> 1:44:25.300\n and he was talking about the first Gulf War.\n\n1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:27.240\n I remember he said a joke that I heard.\n\n1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:29.200\n It made me sit up straight, and he goes,\n\n1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:31.200\n he was in Canada, and he said, we had a war in the States.\n\n1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:33.080\n He was talking about the first Gulf War.\n\n1:44:33.080 --> 1:44:35.720\n And he said, I was in the unenviable position\n\n1:44:35.720 --> 1:44:38.900\n of being for the war, but against the troops.\n\n1:44:38.900 --> 1:44:40.600\n And to me, I love that joke.\n\n1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:41.880\n It was so funny to me, and I was like,\n\n1:44:41.880 --> 1:44:44.520\n oh, you can't get away with that anywhere\n\n1:44:44.520 --> 1:44:46.680\n other than standing on a stage.\n\n1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:48.800\n You couldn't ever say that in an office, really.\n\n1:44:48.800 --> 1:44:50.720\n And this was before, like, it was like PC,\n\n1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:51.920\n and they said, the other thing,\n\n1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:55.240\n I always knew that comedians had to say shit\n\n1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:56.800\n and have it be funny enough\n\n1:44:56.800 --> 1:44:58.900\n that you couldn't get away with it in polite society.\n\n1:44:58.900 --> 1:44:59.900\n That was the whole point.\n\n1:44:59.900 --> 1:45:02.720\n That was why it was a dark theater or a dark nightclub.\n\n1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:03.940\n That's when people had a few drinks.\n\n1:45:03.940 --> 1:45:06.820\n That's what the art form was, and that's why.\n\n1:45:06.820 --> 1:45:08.160\n So a guy like that was influential\n\n1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:09.800\n because I started watching him.\n\n1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:12.120\n And then, of course, I loved SNL when I was a kid,\n\n1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.380\n and I would watch Chris Farley,\n\n1:45:13.380 --> 1:45:17.020\n and I would watch people like even John Belushi\n\n1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:19.200\n going back in the day, but I'd watch Adam Sandler\n\n1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:20.620\n and Will Ferrell and all these guys.\n\n1:45:20.620 --> 1:45:23.120\n I mean, there's so many funny people,\n\n1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:24.780\n but Bill Hicks was kind of funny.\n\n1:45:24.780 --> 1:45:27.720\n And then Patrice O Neill was probably my favorite comedian\n\n1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:29.880\n who's made me laugh more than anybody else.\n\n1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:32.820\n So I think it was you, actually,\n\n1:45:32.820 --> 1:45:34.980\n that maybe on your podcast,\n\n1:45:34.980 --> 1:45:36.260\n we're talking about Patrice O Neill\n\n1:45:36.260 --> 1:45:40.140\n and that he was actually vicious to others.\n\n1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:42.020\n I think he was a little mean to other people,\n\n1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:44.020\n but he was very good to people that he liked, I guess.\n\n1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:46.320\n I think he was like not, I mean, he wasn't,\n\n1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:47.160\n and I've never met him.\n\n1:45:47.160 --> 1:45:49.340\n I have no inside info, but from what I've heard,\n\n1:45:49.340 --> 1:45:51.620\n he was like no nonsense guy, right?\n\n1:45:51.620 --> 1:45:53.180\n He just said what he wanted to say.\n\n1:45:53.180 --> 1:45:55.700\n But I think in terms of comedians,\n\n1:45:55.700 --> 1:45:58.300\n I don't know of anyone funnier than Patrice O Neill\n\n1:45:58.300 --> 1:46:01.180\n who said, in modern times,\n\n1:46:01.180 --> 1:46:03.180\n that said more about our society than him.\n\n1:46:03.180 --> 1:46:05.300\n I mean, he was just a brilliantly funny guy.\n\n1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:06.980\n On the radio, he was funny.\n\n1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:08.900\n On his specials, he was funny.\n\n1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:10.140\n Everywhere, he was funny.\n\n1:46:10.140 --> 1:46:11.500\n And there's something else to be said\n\n1:46:11.500 --> 1:46:15.180\n about the whole medium of comedians doing podcasts.\n\n1:46:15.180 --> 1:46:19.100\n Because it unlocks a weird, special, new thing\n\n1:46:19.100 --> 1:46:20.340\n that changed everything.\n\n1:46:20.340 --> 1:46:22.700\n I mean, Rogan started with that.\n\n1:46:22.700 --> 1:46:23.860\n You're doing that.\n\n1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:27.620\n I think that's a whole nother form\n\n1:46:27.620 --> 1:46:31.940\n of like standups, the ones that have a lot to say.\n\n1:46:31.940 --> 1:46:36.580\n Almost like we get to witness the process\n\n1:46:36.580 --> 1:46:39.620\n of the creation of the jokes in a way, or the mind.\n\n1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:43.940\n The sort of the evolution of the mind behind the jokes.\n\n1:46:43.940 --> 1:46:45.140\n It's just.\n\n1:46:45.140 --> 1:46:47.160\n Comedians relate to social media.\n\n1:46:47.160 --> 1:46:52.140\n Comedians, comedy's, it's a performance based medium.\n\n1:46:52.140 --> 1:46:53.980\n So it's about getting up and doing it,\n\n1:46:53.980 --> 1:46:55.900\n getting up in a club, getting up in a theater,\n\n1:46:55.900 --> 1:46:58.780\n getting up in a bar, getting up wherever you can get up.\n\n1:46:58.780 --> 1:47:03.060\n And comedy for years was about performance.\n\n1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:04.100\n And then on the higher end,\n\n1:47:04.100 --> 1:47:06.540\n it was about movies and TV shows.\n\n1:47:06.540 --> 1:47:09.580\n But we were very slow to get on YouTube.\n\n1:47:09.580 --> 1:47:11.940\n We're very slow to adapt to technology.\n\n1:47:11.940 --> 1:47:16.460\n We're very slow to monetize anything we did on the internet.\n\n1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:19.920\n So podcasting was a way for comics and funny people\n\n1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:23.660\n to kind of get into that space, start earning money.\n\n1:47:23.660 --> 1:47:25.140\n And now because of the pandemic,\n\n1:47:25.140 --> 1:47:27.020\n it's really become essential.\n\n1:47:27.020 --> 1:47:29.100\n And it helps you, and even without the pandemic,\n\n1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:32.660\n it was how you were building a fan base.\n\n1:47:32.660 --> 1:47:35.500\n And that's like, but comics were very reticent\n\n1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:36.900\n to embrace social media at all\n\n1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:39.820\n because they thought it was cheap and they didn't like it.\n\n1:47:39.820 --> 1:47:41.460\n And they thought the people on it were idiots\n\n1:47:41.460 --> 1:47:43.860\n and were unfunny and it was just a blatant,\n\n1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:45.640\n whatever it was, whether it was a money grab\n\n1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:48.500\n or it was just too commercial in a sense\n\n1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:49.740\n where they're like, hey, look at me.\n\n1:47:49.740 --> 1:47:51.600\n Like it was just goofy, right?\n\n1:47:51.600 --> 1:47:56.600\n And then comics, I think got displaced\n\n1:47:56.720 --> 1:47:58.680\n because all the YouTubers came in\n\n1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:00.360\n and all the social media stars came in\n\n1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:03.080\n and they really knocked comics off\n\n1:48:03.080 --> 1:48:04.880\n because now people are much more,\n\n1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:06.160\n like if you ask anyone under 30\n\n1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:08.920\n who their favorite comedian is, they say David Dobrik.\n\n1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:09.760\n And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:13.040\n David's a funny guy, but like what you,\n\n1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:17.420\n not especially to me a ton, but that's okay.\n\n1:48:17.420 --> 1:48:21.600\n I don't, but he makes people laugh, so he's funny.\n\n1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:24.720\n But he's what people, that's a comedian now.\n\n1:48:24.720 --> 1:48:28.460\n So comics got beat by other people coming\n\n1:48:28.460 --> 1:48:33.380\n into a digital space before they did laying the groundwork\n\n1:48:33.380 --> 1:48:34.960\n and taking it over.\n\n1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:38.440\n And now comics are just trying to stay alive.\n\n1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:41.300\n Like even my podcast, which is people really like it,\n\n1:48:41.300 --> 1:48:43.360\n thank God, and I love doing it.\n\n1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:44.500\n The Tim Dillon Show.\n\n1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:45.400\n Well, thank you.\n\n1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:50.400\n I was late, you know, I mean, I was, I just, you know,\n\n1:48:50.740 --> 1:48:52.180\n I've been podcasting for a long time,\n\n1:48:52.180 --> 1:48:53.460\n but really dedicating myself\n\n1:48:53.460 --> 1:48:55.620\n and putting the resources behind it, I was late to it.\n\n1:48:55.620 --> 1:48:58.060\n Like, I was like, hey, I'm telling jokes on stage,\n\n1:48:58.060 --> 1:49:00.540\n which is great, but I should have been allocating more time\n\n1:49:00.540 --> 1:49:02.300\n to building an infrastructure online.\n\n1:49:02.300 --> 1:49:04.620\n And I wasn't doing it and a lot of comics weren't doing it.\n\n1:49:04.620 --> 1:49:06.360\n Funny comics weren't doing it.\n\n1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:08.060\n Comics should be doing it.\n\n1:49:08.060 --> 1:49:09.300\n And I think when the pandemic ends,\n\n1:49:09.300 --> 1:49:12.180\n a lot of comics will just keep doing live standup,\n\n1:49:12.180 --> 1:49:14.620\n but I will keep, obviously I'm gonna go back on the road\n\n1:49:14.620 --> 1:49:16.620\n and do live standup, but I will keep doing this podcast\n\n1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:17.460\n and building digitally too.\n\n1:49:17.460 --> 1:49:19.260\n But you're also exploring ideas.\n\n1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:21.660\n You're doing like short videos and so on.\n\n1:49:21.660 --> 1:49:26.180\n You're trying to look for different mediums of how to be funny.\n\n1:49:26.180 --> 1:49:27.340\n I wanna be funny everywhere.\n\n1:49:27.340 --> 1:49:28.300\n I wanna be funny everywhere.\n\n1:49:28.300 --> 1:49:29.500\n I love making things too.\n\n1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:33.180\n My producer, Ben Avery, is like a brilliant editor\n\n1:49:33.180 --> 1:49:36.100\n and comedic mind, even though he's not a standup.\n\n1:49:36.100 --> 1:49:38.100\n He's able to, he understands funny,\n\n1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:39.220\n he understands what makes me funny.\n\n1:49:39.220 --> 1:49:41.980\n We're able to make these really, I mean,\n\n1:49:41.980 --> 1:49:44.060\n some of those videos, they're just brilliant little videos,\n\n1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:45.460\n even though they're tiny little videos,\n\n1:49:45.460 --> 1:49:47.580\n they're fucking as funny as anything.\n\n1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:48.860\n And it's not me.\n\n1:49:48.860 --> 1:49:50.900\n It's me working with somebody else\n\n1:49:50.900 --> 1:49:52.860\n to make something really great.\n\n1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:56.820\n And it's that relationship that's very important.\n\n1:49:56.820 --> 1:50:00.180\n In some sense, the medium of a short video is a challenge,\n\n1:50:00.180 --> 1:50:02.260\n just like the medium of a short tweet.\n\n1:50:02.260 --> 1:50:03.100\n Of course.\n\n1:50:03.100 --> 1:50:04.980\n How to say something.\n\n1:50:04.980 --> 1:50:08.980\n I mean, whatever the flavor is of what's in your heart,\n\n1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:10.460\n what's in your mind, how to say it,\n\n1:50:10.460 --> 1:50:13.660\n whether it's the goal is funny or something,\n\n1:50:13.660 --> 1:50:15.780\n or just an expressing idea.\n\n1:50:15.780 --> 1:50:18.220\n I think the whole thing that's important to us\n\n1:50:18.220 --> 1:50:20.220\n is that it's an extension of,\n\n1:50:20.220 --> 1:50:22.340\n really like an extension of your friendship in a way.\n\n1:50:22.340 --> 1:50:24.580\n Like, are you guys laughing at it?\n\n1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:27.940\n Are you guys making each other laugh about this idea?\n\n1:50:27.940 --> 1:50:29.220\n And if that's the case,\n\n1:50:29.220 --> 1:50:31.860\n other people are going to laugh at it.\n\n1:50:31.860 --> 1:50:34.260\n I think so much of the old medium was like,\n\n1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:35.860\n everything was top down.\n\n1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:37.260\n Okay, pitch me this idea.\n\n1:50:37.260 --> 1:50:38.700\n I pitch it to the showrunner.\n\n1:50:38.700 --> 1:50:39.900\n They pitch it to the network.\n\n1:50:39.900 --> 1:50:42.020\n They pitch it to this, to that, to that.\n\n1:50:42.020 --> 1:50:43.820\n Standards and practices, sales,\n\n1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:45.500\n and we got to go through everything.\n\n1:50:45.500 --> 1:50:48.020\n Now it's just like, are me and a few buddies\n\n1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:51.260\n or even just one buddy laughing at this idea?\n\n1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:52.740\n Does it captivate us?\n\n1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:55.100\n And do we see it visually?\n\n1:50:55.100 --> 1:50:58.620\n And also a great line from Roseanne,\n\n1:50:58.620 --> 1:51:01.940\n a guy, not Roseanne, but a guy that worked on Roseanne,\n\n1:51:01.940 --> 1:51:03.300\n the old Roseanne, the great one.\n\n1:51:03.300 --> 1:51:06.700\n He said, is it funny with the sound off?\n\n1:51:06.700 --> 1:51:07.540\n Right.\n\n1:51:07.540 --> 1:51:08.380\n That's what we try to do.\n\n1:51:08.380 --> 1:51:09.200\n That's brilliant.\n\n1:51:09.200 --> 1:51:10.100\n Is it funny with the sound off?\n\n1:51:10.100 --> 1:51:11.900\n When you see me in the dumb things,\n\n1:51:11.900 --> 1:51:15.140\n or me in the Meghan McCain, or me in the thing,\n\n1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:15.980\n is it funny with the sound off?\n\n1:51:15.980 --> 1:51:17.500\n And if it's funny with the sound off,\n\n1:51:17.500 --> 1:51:18.620\n you have a good starting point.\n\n1:51:18.620 --> 1:51:20.820\n That's hilarious, because you,\n\n1:51:20.820 --> 1:51:22.820\n I would say you're one of the people,\n\n1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:25.180\n because most people are not funny with the sound off,\n\n1:51:25.180 --> 1:51:26.020\n most comedians.\n\n1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:28.880\n Like you, Will Ferrell's another example of that.\n\n1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:32.620\n There's something about when I click on one of your videos,\n\n1:51:32.620 --> 1:51:36.820\n it's funny, just like the first thing I see, just your face.\n\n1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:37.780\n We, well, thank you.\n\n1:51:37.780 --> 1:51:38.620\n That's very sweet.\n\n1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:40.280\n But I mean, thank God.\n\n1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:41.620\n I mean, that's what we try to do, right?\n\n1:51:41.620 --> 1:51:42.620\n We're trying to be funny.\n\n1:51:42.620 --> 1:51:43.460\n Yeah.\n\n1:51:43.460 --> 1:51:45.020\n So we're trying to be funny.\n\n1:51:45.020 --> 1:51:46.540\n Can we talk about love a little bit?\n\n1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:48.100\n Sure.\n\n1:51:48.100 --> 1:51:52.420\n So you came out of the closet as being gay\n\n1:51:52.420 --> 1:51:53.700\n when you were 25.\n\n1:51:53.700 --> 1:51:55.780\n Yeah, it was late, very late.\n\n1:51:55.780 --> 1:51:56.620\n Very late.\n\n1:51:56.620 --> 1:51:57.460\n Before then.\n\n1:51:57.460 --> 1:51:58.280\n By today's standards.\n\n1:51:58.280 --> 1:52:03.280\n During and after, how has your view on love evolved?\n\n1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:05.720\n Interesting.\n\n1:52:05.720 --> 1:52:08.300\n It's so hard to say, because like I would,\n\n1:52:08.300 --> 1:52:12.240\n I'd like to make a very like Disneyfied statement\n\n1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:15.700\n about like that you can't be in love secretively.\n\n1:52:15.700 --> 1:52:16.660\n You should be honest.\n\n1:52:16.660 --> 1:52:18.980\n Love should all be about honesty, but that's not true.\n\n1:52:18.980 --> 1:52:19.820\n Right?\n\n1:52:19.820 --> 1:52:21.420\n There's people that are in love\n\n1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:23.620\n that are lying to everyone else,\n\n1:52:23.620 --> 1:52:24.940\n but they're deeply in love.\n\n1:52:24.940 --> 1:52:25.860\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:25.860 --> 1:52:27.020\n I would love to say something like,\n\n1:52:27.020 --> 1:52:30.140\n honesty is an ingredient for love, you know?\n\n1:52:30.140 --> 1:52:33.020\n But I don't know, maybe honesty with each other.\n\n1:52:33.020 --> 1:52:35.800\n But I mean, I think there's a lot of people in the world\n\n1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:36.980\n that aren't honest.\n\n1:52:36.980 --> 1:52:39.380\n My view on love is super important.\n\n1:52:39.380 --> 1:52:43.460\n I think that it's, a lot of society in America\n\n1:52:43.460 --> 1:52:44.820\n is all about love.\n\n1:52:44.820 --> 1:52:49.020\n We don't tend to focus on other things\n\n1:52:49.020 --> 1:52:51.980\n in terms of like, you know, friendship\n\n1:52:51.980 --> 1:52:54.740\n or sustainability of that.\n\n1:52:54.740 --> 1:52:55.620\n Cause I think that a lot,\n\n1:52:55.620 --> 1:52:58.320\n I know a lot of people in relationships where it's like,\n\n1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:01.180\n I don't know, they're not, they are, they love each other,\n\n1:53:01.180 --> 1:53:03.980\n but like, it's also a rock solid couple\n\n1:53:03.980 --> 1:53:07.700\n because they are, they're very compatible\n\n1:53:07.700 --> 1:53:09.020\n in many other ways.\n\n1:53:09.020 --> 1:53:09.860\n Right.\n\n1:53:09.860 --> 1:53:10.700\n So I think that like,\n\n1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:11.520\n They're friends.\n\n1:53:11.520 --> 1:53:12.360\n They have, right.\n\n1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.980\n I see friendship and love as the same thing.\n\n1:53:13.980 --> 1:53:15.260\n There's just parts of it that are, right?\n\n1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:18.300\n So it's like, I look at it as like,\n\n1:53:18.300 --> 1:53:21.700\n there is, there needs to be more than just like that,\n\n1:53:21.700 --> 1:53:25.860\n like amazing, like chemistry or physical attraction\n\n1:53:25.860 --> 1:53:28.580\n that is this chemical thing that happens.\n\n1:53:28.580 --> 1:53:30.420\n There should be like some underlying,\n\n1:53:30.420 --> 1:53:32.820\n I mean, again, that's from what I,\n\n1:53:32.820 --> 1:53:36.100\n that's what I've observed as really long lasting,\n\n1:53:36.100 --> 1:53:37.620\n successful relationships.\n\n1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:40.900\n Well, is there something about coming out that,\n\n1:53:42.380 --> 1:53:45.820\n that was, that you took away,\n\n1:53:45.820 --> 1:53:47.680\n that you remember as profound,\n\n1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:48.520\n Yes.\n\n1:53:48.520 --> 1:53:52.680\n That it was my, that I, it wasn't society, it was me.\n\n1:53:52.680 --> 1:53:55.180\n So there were kids that were out in my high school\n\n1:53:55.180 --> 1:53:58.580\n that I waited years later to do it.\n\n1:53:58.580 --> 1:54:00.460\n That was no one's fault but my own.\n\n1:54:00.460 --> 1:54:02.640\n So I was taking a cowardly way out\n\n1:54:02.640 --> 1:54:03.500\n and a lot of people.\n\n1:54:03.500 --> 1:54:06.060\n So I could blame society or like,\n\n1:54:06.060 --> 1:54:07.820\n oh, I lived in a conservative area\n\n1:54:07.820 --> 1:54:09.780\n and I grew up in that.\n\n1:54:09.780 --> 1:54:11.820\n You should take responsibility for your own decisions.\n\n1:54:11.820 --> 1:54:12.740\n And if you're being cowardly,\n\n1:54:12.740 --> 1:54:14.460\n admit that you're being cowardly.\n\n1:54:14.460 --> 1:54:16.180\n So that's what I took out of it is that\n\n1:54:16.180 --> 1:54:19.180\n it's not society's fault that you chose to be a coward.\n\n1:54:19.180 --> 1:54:21.060\n Society will never be perfect.\n\n1:54:21.060 --> 1:54:23.540\n You have to be honest when you're ready to be honest\n\n1:54:23.540 --> 1:54:25.120\n or however you want to be honest,\n\n1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:26.800\n but it's not somebody, too much now\n\n1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:29.860\n is it's everyone else's fault that you didn't take,\n\n1:54:29.860 --> 1:54:31.580\n make a hard choice or a hard decision.\n\n1:54:31.580 --> 1:54:33.700\n So that's kind of what I took out of it.\n\n1:54:33.700 --> 1:54:36.320\n So now in retrospect, you see yourself as,\n\n1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:38.180\n were being afraid.\n\n1:54:38.180 --> 1:54:40.740\n Do you think at the time?\n\n1:54:40.740 --> 1:54:42.100\n Well, I wanted people to like me,\n\n1:54:42.100 --> 1:54:45.080\n which is the disease of humanity, right?\n\n1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:46.180\n Is that we want to be liked.\n\n1:54:46.180 --> 1:54:48.780\n And what happens is if you want people to like you\n\n1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:49.660\n and love you even,\n\n1:54:49.660 --> 1:54:52.060\n you want people to feel comfortable with you.\n\n1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:53.740\n And those were people like your family?\n\n1:54:53.740 --> 1:54:55.140\n Friends more.\n\n1:54:55.140 --> 1:54:56.380\n My family I would always,\n\n1:54:56.380 --> 1:54:57.940\n could always throw in the street,\n\n1:54:57.940 --> 1:54:59.580\n but I'm kidding.\n\n1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:01.820\n I mean, but I am not,\n\n1:55:01.820 --> 1:55:03.660\n but my friends, my circle of friends,\n\n1:55:03.660 --> 1:55:06.820\n which I were my family at the time when you're a senior,\n\n1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:08.380\n when you're 10th, 11th grade in high school,\n\n1:55:08.380 --> 1:55:09.940\n your friends are your family.\n\n1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:10.780\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:55:10.780 --> 1:55:11.680\n Like that's your,\n\n1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:12.780\n so you don't want to do anything\n\n1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:15.260\n that puts you on the outside of the circle.\n\n1:55:15.260 --> 1:55:16.760\n It's just thinking back to that fear.\n\n1:55:16.760 --> 1:55:19.360\n Is there things you're afraid of now?\n\n1:55:19.360 --> 1:55:21.880\n That you're not doing, you're afraid to do?\n\n1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:23.980\n I'm afraid of all kinds of things.\n\n1:55:23.980 --> 1:55:26.540\n I'm afraid of not being good at my job,\n\n1:55:26.540 --> 1:55:29.900\n not being funny, letting people down,\n\n1:55:29.900 --> 1:55:33.220\n not putting out products that are good,\n\n1:55:33.220 --> 1:55:36.020\n whether it's the podcast every week or stand up\n\n1:55:36.020 --> 1:55:36.860\n or the videos,\n\n1:55:36.860 --> 1:55:37.780\n like I'm afraid of like,\n\n1:55:37.780 --> 1:55:40.160\n there's a ton of people that really enjoy what we do.\n\n1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:41.620\n So when you're in that position,\n\n1:55:41.620 --> 1:55:44.540\n you're nervous that you're going to start doing things\n\n1:55:44.540 --> 1:55:45.380\n that they don't like.\n\n1:55:45.380 --> 1:55:46.900\n So the new things you want to do,\n\n1:55:46.900 --> 1:55:48.500\n the evolution you want to do,\n\n1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.060\n you want to make sure you're evolving in the right way.\n\n1:55:51.060 --> 1:55:52.460\n You want to make sure that you're doing things\n\n1:55:52.460 --> 1:55:54.540\n that are consistent with why people liked you,\n\n1:55:54.540 --> 1:55:56.660\n but also you don't want to put yourself in a box\n\n1:55:56.660 --> 1:55:59.780\n and limit what you can be going forward.\n\n1:55:59.780 --> 1:56:02.980\n So like, I had a talk with the CEO of NBC Universal once.\n\n1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:05.740\n I was doing some internal sketch for them.\n\n1:56:05.740 --> 1:56:08.660\n And I was playing like a cab driver and he was a,\n\n1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:10.820\n and he's not the current CEO, but he's a former CEO.\n\n1:56:10.820 --> 1:56:12.700\n And I said to him, what's the hardest part of running\n\n1:56:12.700 --> 1:56:14.820\n a corporation of this size?\n\n1:56:14.820 --> 1:56:17.100\n And he said something very interesting.\n\n1:56:17.100 --> 1:56:18.980\n He said, the hardest part is maximizing\n\n1:56:18.980 --> 1:56:22.460\n the current profit model of what you have\n\n1:56:22.460 --> 1:56:25.220\n at the same time, getting ready, getting ready,\n\n1:56:25.220 --> 1:56:26.140\n getting the company ready\n\n1:56:26.140 --> 1:56:27.940\n for where it's going to be in five years.\n\n1:56:27.940 --> 1:56:29.780\n He said, those are often at odds.\n\n1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:30.980\n And that's the toughest thing.\n\n1:56:30.980 --> 1:56:32.900\n He goes, cause I could just bang out\n\n1:56:32.900 --> 1:56:34.100\n everything I got to do right now.\n\n1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:35.860\n And we're going to make a lot of money doing this,\n\n1:56:35.860 --> 1:56:37.900\n but am I devoting enough resources into digital\n\n1:56:37.900 --> 1:56:39.940\n so that in five years, when that's where everything lives,\n\n1:56:39.940 --> 1:56:42.220\n are we competitive in that space?\n\n1:56:42.220 --> 1:56:44.900\n So as funny as I am now, hopefully to people\n\n1:56:44.900 --> 1:56:46.540\n and a lot of the things that I want to do now,\n\n1:56:46.540 --> 1:56:49.900\n I'm going, what am I, what groundwork am I not laying\n\n1:56:49.900 --> 1:56:52.060\n for three to five years down the road\n\n1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:55.620\n so that I can be adapting to the trends\n\n1:56:55.620 --> 1:56:58.420\n that are important then in terms of not so much\n\n1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:01.540\n comedic trends, but like the technological trends,\n\n1:57:01.540 --> 1:57:04.340\n like what is the, what is the, you know,\n\n1:57:04.340 --> 1:57:06.220\n I should have done podcasting earlier.\n\n1:57:06.220 --> 1:57:09.100\n What should I, should I have a bigger presence on TikTok?\n\n1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:10.220\n Should I have a bigger presence here?\n\n1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:12.100\n Should I have a business, or should I be on Twitch?\n\n1:57:12.100 --> 1:57:12.940\n Should I be doing this?\n\n1:57:12.940 --> 1:57:13.780\n Should I be doing that?\n\n1:57:13.780 --> 1:57:15.540\n What am I not doing that I should be doing\n\n1:57:15.540 --> 1:57:17.260\n that I'll regret not doing?\n\n1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.820\n And those are, those are the conversations\n\n1:57:19.820 --> 1:57:21.420\n I think I have in my own head all the time.\n\n1:57:21.420 --> 1:57:23.300\n And I guess there's parallels to coming out as gay\n\n1:57:23.300 --> 1:57:26.140\n or just parallels in like a career path\n\n1:57:26.140 --> 1:57:29.980\n so you're taking all that, that's ultimately just fear.\n\n1:57:29.980 --> 1:57:31.220\n It's fear. Yeah.\n\n1:57:31.220 --> 1:57:34.620\n It's the fear of, you know, the best thing that happened\n\n1:57:34.620 --> 1:57:37.020\n in my career was that I came to LA.\n\n1:57:37.020 --> 1:57:41.740\n I didn't have an idea of what was going to happen.\n\n1:57:41.740 --> 1:57:45.660\n I met somebody who was really committed\n\n1:57:45.660 --> 1:57:50.020\n to making funny things that we just wanted to be funny.\n\n1:57:50.020 --> 1:57:51.220\n No one would let us be funny.\n\n1:57:51.220 --> 1:57:53.860\n We didn't have Comedy Central letting us be funny.\n\n1:57:53.860 --> 1:57:55.660\n We didn't have HBO, we didn't have Netflix.\n\n1:57:55.660 --> 1:57:58.100\n We just had a garage and a phone in the beginning\n\n1:57:58.100 --> 1:58:00.220\n and then a camera and then a thing.\n\n1:58:00.220 --> 1:58:01.700\n And we just wanted to be funny.\n\n1:58:01.700 --> 1:58:03.980\n And that was the greatest risk really I took\n\n1:58:03.980 --> 1:58:06.060\n because I was like, well, I don't know what else\n\n1:58:06.060 --> 1:58:08.640\n is going to happen right now, but I just want to be funny.\n\n1:58:08.640 --> 1:58:10.180\n And funny saved my life, right?\n\n1:58:10.180 --> 1:58:11.580\n I mean, funny got me out of drugs.\n\n1:58:11.580 --> 1:58:12.940\n Funny probably got me out of the closet.\n\n1:58:12.940 --> 1:58:14.960\n Funny was the thing that I was able to do\n\n1:58:14.960 --> 1:58:16.800\n that made everything okay in my own head.\n\n1:58:16.800 --> 1:58:18.120\n So I was like, as long as I'm being funny,\n\n1:58:18.120 --> 1:58:19.020\n something good will happen.\n\n1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:21.700\n So we did that and then something really cool happened\n\n1:58:21.700 --> 1:58:23.740\n that we were able to do a lot of cool things,\n\n1:58:23.740 --> 1:58:25.660\n but that's what it is.\n\n1:58:25.660 --> 1:58:27.520\n It's fear that keeps you from being\n\n1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:29.340\n the better version of yourself.\n\n1:58:29.340 --> 1:58:33.540\n Your mom, I mean, you have so many complicated,\n\n1:58:33.540 --> 1:58:34.900\n fascinating parts of your story.\n\n1:58:34.900 --> 1:58:35.900\n Oh, thank you.\n\n1:58:35.900 --> 1:58:39.340\n Your mom, as you were growing up, suffered.\n\n1:58:39.340 --> 1:58:40.180\n Schizophrenic, yeah.\n\n1:58:40.180 --> 1:58:43.460\n Well, from mental illness, yeah, schizophrenia.\n\n1:58:43.460 --> 1:58:45.780\n Can you tell her story and how that relationship\n\n1:58:45.780 --> 1:58:46.940\n has changed over the years?\n\n1:58:46.940 --> 1:58:49.700\n Yeah, well, she was always eccentric and always,\n\n1:58:49.700 --> 1:58:51.380\n you know, the terms for schizophrenia\n\n1:58:51.380 --> 1:58:52.780\n in an Irish Catholic household\n\n1:58:52.780 --> 1:58:56.180\n where we didn't talk about anything were eccentric, fun.\n\n1:58:56.180 --> 1:58:57.420\n She's fun.\n\n1:58:57.420 --> 1:58:58.260\n There's a theme to this conversation.\n\n1:58:58.260 --> 1:58:59.860\n She's unpredictable.\n\n1:58:59.860 --> 1:59:04.860\n She's a wire, she was a live wire.\n\n1:59:04.980 --> 1:59:06.740\n Any of the words you would use to describe somebody\n\n1:59:06.740 --> 1:59:09.880\n who was a fucking lunatic, but you wouldn't say that.\n\n1:59:11.660 --> 1:59:12.700\n Pop that spin.\n\n1:59:12.700 --> 1:59:17.060\n Right, she started experiencing symptoms\n\n1:59:17.060 --> 1:59:18.260\n probably early on in her life,\n\n1:59:18.260 --> 1:59:22.620\n but she also, I think, started really manifesting them\n\n1:59:22.620 --> 1:59:27.620\n when I was in my mid teens, so like 14, 13, 14 area.\n\n1:59:29.400 --> 1:59:30.980\n And she got really, really bad.\n\n1:59:30.980 --> 1:59:33.060\n And then I think she was institutionalized\n\n1:59:33.060 --> 1:59:35.900\n about 10 years ago, a little over 10 years ago.\n\n1:59:35.900 --> 1:59:37.740\n And she could really no longer live on her own.\n\n1:59:37.740 --> 1:59:39.520\n She was unable to go to work.\n\n1:59:39.520 --> 1:59:40.880\n She was unable to function.\n\n1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:42.060\n So I visit her when I can.\n\n1:59:42.060 --> 1:59:42.940\n Obviously, I'm not in New York.\n\n1:59:42.940 --> 1:59:44.420\n Whenever I go to New York, I visit her.\n\n1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:47.260\n She's aware of what I do, my career and everything like that.\n\n1:59:47.260 --> 1:59:48.380\n She has good days and bad days,\n\n1:59:48.380 --> 1:59:51.440\n but mental illness is a thing that's very tough.\n\n1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:53.180\n We don't talk about it as a society.\n\n1:59:53.180 --> 1:59:57.220\n People with mental problems don't get that much attention.\n\n1:59:57.220 --> 2:00:00.340\n We tend to think that they did something wrong\n\n2:00:00.340 --> 2:00:04.620\n or that they deserve it or that they are to be ignored.\n\n2:00:04.620 --> 2:00:06.500\n And we don't devote a lot of resources into it,\n\n2:00:06.500 --> 2:00:09.140\n which is unfortunate because then you have the junk gurus\n\n2:00:09.140 --> 2:00:10.100\n come in and go like,\n\n2:00:10.100 --> 2:00:12.500\n let's diagnose your mental illness off Instagram.\n\n2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:14.260\n And it's like, that's not the move.\n\n2:00:15.140 --> 2:00:15.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:00:15.980 --> 2:00:17.500\n Do you love her?\n\n2:00:17.500 --> 2:00:19.220\n I do, I do.\n\n2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:24.220\n I love her, but I also remember her that isn't her now.\n\n2:00:24.220 --> 2:00:28.000\n And when someone has mental illness that's severe,\n\n2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:31.180\n you make peace with their death before they die.\n\n2:00:31.180 --> 2:00:32.080\n Wow, yeah.\n\n2:00:32.080 --> 2:00:36.340\n Because the part of them that you love and remember\n\n2:00:36.340 --> 2:00:41.340\n a lot of cases is not evident or obvious.\n\n2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:44.060\n Now, my mother's still a loving person that I love,\n\n2:00:44.060 --> 2:00:49.060\n but the fun, her ability to be present in the moment\n\n2:00:49.540 --> 2:00:54.540\n and to not, that is lost with the progression of realness\n\n2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:56.260\n so that you still love her.\n\n2:00:56.260 --> 2:00:59.220\n And I mean, again, your parents,\n\n2:00:59.220 --> 2:01:01.620\n the time horizons you have with your parents are unknown.\n\n2:01:01.620 --> 2:01:02.460\n People don't know.\n\n2:01:02.460 --> 2:01:04.640\n I have friends that their parents were in their lives\n\n2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:06.060\n for their entire life.\n\n2:01:06.060 --> 2:01:07.740\n And I have friends whose parents were in their life,\n\n2:01:07.740 --> 2:01:10.020\n but my mother was a very, she knew what I was.\n\n2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:11.340\n When I was a little kid, I was an actor.\n\n2:01:11.340 --> 2:01:12.980\n When I was like six to 12,\n\n2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:14.340\n my mother knew that I was a performer.\n\n2:01:14.340 --> 2:01:16.320\n She knew what I was and what I'd ultimately do.\n\n2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:17.540\n She recognized that in me.\n\n2:01:17.540 --> 2:01:19.280\n And when I said to her, I want to audition for shows,\n\n2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:20.540\n I want to be on stage, I want to be on this,\n\n2:01:20.540 --> 2:01:22.980\n I want to do this, she let me do it\n\n2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.460\n because she knew who I was\n\n2:01:24.460 --> 2:01:25.900\n and she didn't want to get in the way\n\n2:01:25.900 --> 2:01:30.660\n of me being a human being, a fully realized person at six.\n\n2:01:30.660 --> 2:01:33.400\n So that's probably the best thing a parent can do for a kid\n\n2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:35.900\n is let them be who they are.\n\n2:01:35.900 --> 2:01:37.700\n And my mother did that.\n\n2:01:37.700 --> 2:01:39.140\n So that, I mean, that's good.\n\n2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:42.740\n We ate too much fast food.\n\n2:01:42.740 --> 2:01:44.820\n There were negatives, but she did let me be who I was.\n\n2:01:44.820 --> 2:01:46.780\n That's why you want to throw them out into the street.\n\n2:01:46.780 --> 2:01:48.060\n Yeah, sometimes.\n\n2:01:50.740 --> 2:01:55.740\n But coming to accept the mortality of her,\n\n2:01:57.520 --> 2:02:00.980\n I guess, identity as you remember it from childhood,\n\n2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:04.260\n do you ponder your own mortality?\n\n2:02:04.260 --> 2:02:06.100\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n2:02:06.100 --> 2:02:06.940\n I'm afraid of death.\n\n2:02:06.940 --> 2:02:10.420\n I don't like the idea of death, but I know it's happening.\n\n2:02:10.420 --> 2:02:12.340\n I know it's going to happen eventually.\n\n2:02:12.340 --> 2:02:13.180\n I don't love it.\n\n2:02:13.180 --> 2:02:14.140\n Do you think about it?\n\n2:02:14.140 --> 2:02:15.700\n I think about, I want to do some good stuff\n\n2:02:15.700 --> 2:02:16.900\n that people can look back at.\n\n2:02:16.900 --> 2:02:18.340\n And I think I'm proud of the show\n\n2:02:18.340 --> 2:02:19.820\n where if people look back at the show,\n\n2:02:19.820 --> 2:02:21.580\n I don't know how comedy ages or whatever,\n\n2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:23.420\n but I think I put out a lot of stuff\n\n2:02:23.420 --> 2:02:24.780\n and I want to continue to put out stuff\n\n2:02:24.780 --> 2:02:26.060\n and I want to put out a few specials\n\n2:02:26.060 --> 2:02:27.740\n that people can look back at and go,\n\n2:02:27.740 --> 2:02:30.520\n oh, this guy was really funny in this really crazy,\n\n2:02:30.520 --> 2:02:32.780\n he lived in the latter part of this century\n\n2:02:32.780 --> 2:02:33.920\n when all this shit was going on.\n\n2:02:33.920 --> 2:02:35.620\n And he kind of made fun of it.\n\n2:02:35.620 --> 2:02:40.620\n And he did something to make people's lives a little better\n\n2:02:40.660 --> 2:02:43.660\n just by having a few laughs.\n\n2:02:43.660 --> 2:02:45.300\n What do you think about,\n\n2:02:45.300 --> 2:02:48.460\n this is something like in the podcast context,\n\n2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:53.020\n do you think you'll have just one or two or three shows\n\n2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:56.940\n out of thousands maybe that are like the truly special ones?\n\n2:02:56.940 --> 2:02:57.900\n That's probably the case.\n\n2:02:57.900 --> 2:03:00.700\n Or do you think it's an entirety of the body of work?\n\n2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:02.900\n I think people will take 10 minute clips\n\n2:03:02.900 --> 2:03:05.380\n from all different shows and put them together.\n\n2:03:05.380 --> 2:03:06.300\n And there's a highlight.\n\n2:03:06.300 --> 2:03:08.000\n Yeah, like a highlight reel of just like,\n\n2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.900\n these are like the best things that he's ever done\n\n2:03:10.900 --> 2:03:12.340\n or the best rants he's ever had,\n\n2:03:12.340 --> 2:03:13.420\n the best things, whatever.\n\n2:03:13.420 --> 2:03:16.980\n So the legacy would be that this was an important voice\n\n2:03:16.980 --> 2:03:18.900\n in a very weird time.\n\n2:03:18.900 --> 2:03:21.580\n I would hope that that's part of it.\n\n2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:24.020\n And I hope that I continue to be,\n\n2:03:24.020 --> 2:03:25.860\n you say important, I say funny,\n\n2:03:25.860 --> 2:03:28.380\n but hopefully I continue to be a voice.\n\n2:03:28.380 --> 2:03:30.460\n And that's what I think when I think about death,\n\n2:03:30.460 --> 2:03:33.420\n I think about like, what do people come on earth to do?\n\n2:03:33.420 --> 2:03:34.500\n And I think I came,\n\n2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:37.260\n I think my main purpose on this planet\n\n2:03:37.260 --> 2:03:39.940\n other than to experience whatever love\n\n2:03:39.940 --> 2:03:44.580\n or worthiness or whatever is to entertain people.\n\n2:03:44.580 --> 2:03:46.180\n And there's a lot of people in comedy right now\n\n2:03:46.180 --> 2:03:49.780\n that are not entertainers, and that's really the problem.\n\n2:03:49.780 --> 2:03:51.660\n But, and they got into comedy sort of the way\n\n2:03:51.660 --> 2:03:55.420\n that you can walk into the wrong store in a mall\n\n2:03:55.420 --> 2:03:57.500\n and then not realize you're in the wrong store\n\n2:03:57.500 --> 2:03:58.800\n and try on a bunch of clothes and then go,\n\n2:03:58.800 --> 2:04:00.940\n fuck, I wasted my whole afternoon.\n\n2:04:00.940 --> 2:04:02.720\n But I think I've always kind of been an entertainer\n\n2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:04.140\n and that's what I wanna do.\n\n2:04:04.140 --> 2:04:07.020\n There's a, unfortunately, sadly,\n\n2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:08.940\n a lot of people that look up to you.\n\n2:04:08.940 --> 2:04:12.360\n That is a horrible thing, but life is a nightmare.\n\n2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:13.200\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:14.420 --> 2:04:16.780\n If you were to give them advice,\n\n2:04:16.780 --> 2:04:20.320\n young folks, people in college, maybe even high school,\n\n2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.460\n but people in their 20s about what to do with their life,\n\n2:04:24.460 --> 2:04:27.120\n whether it's career, whether it's just life in general,\n\n2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:27.960\n what would you say?\n\n2:04:27.960 --> 2:04:29.580\n Ignore everyone.\n\n2:04:29.580 --> 2:04:31.340\n Make a few good friends.\n\n2:04:32.540 --> 2:04:37.540\n Truly have honest conversations with yourself about your,\n\n2:04:39.060 --> 2:04:42.500\n when do you feel the most alive?\n\n2:04:42.500 --> 2:04:44.340\n Figure that out.\n\n2:04:44.340 --> 2:04:47.220\n When and how do you feel the most alive?\n\n2:04:47.220 --> 2:04:48.340\n Yeah.\n\n2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:50.300\n Figure that out.\n\n2:04:50.300 --> 2:04:52.180\n Try to figure out a job or a career\n\n2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:53.880\n that can replicate that feeling.\n\n2:04:56.240 --> 2:04:57.460\n Don't listen to anyone.\n\n2:04:57.460 --> 2:04:58.860\n Don't listen to your parents.\n\n2:04:58.860 --> 2:05:01.140\n Don't listen to the gurus on the internet.\n\n2:05:01.140 --> 2:05:02.540\n Don't listen to me.\n\n2:05:02.540 --> 2:05:03.780\n Don't listen to anyone.\n\n2:05:03.780 --> 2:05:07.500\n Figure out where you feel the most alive.\n\n2:05:07.500 --> 2:05:09.100\n Where do you feel excited?\n\n2:05:09.100 --> 2:05:11.460\n Where does your pulse quicken?\n\n2:05:11.460 --> 2:05:13.640\n What do you feel matters?\n\n2:05:13.640 --> 2:05:16.380\n When you're in a situation, do you feel like it matters?\n\n2:05:17.260 --> 2:05:18.580\n What situation was that?\n\n2:05:18.580 --> 2:05:20.460\n What got you excited?\n\n2:05:20.460 --> 2:05:24.440\n What thing did you walk into where you looked around\n\n2:05:24.440 --> 2:05:25.800\n and were taken back and you're like,\n\n2:05:25.800 --> 2:05:27.180\n wow, this is amazing?\n\n2:05:27.180 --> 2:05:28.980\n And I'm filled with awe.\n\n2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:33.980\n If you can figure out a life where you can excite yourself,\n\n2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:37.980\n you might not use drugs or alcohol or a sex addiction\n\n2:05:37.980 --> 2:05:41.100\n or gambling or irresponsibility.\n\n2:05:41.100 --> 2:05:44.140\n You might not have to get your fucking kicks\n\n2:05:44.140 --> 2:05:46.440\n in very destructive places\n\n2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:48.900\n if you can get them in a productive place.\n\n2:05:48.900 --> 2:05:53.020\n Well, you had a pretty weaving life\n\n2:05:53.020 --> 2:05:56.860\n that's full of mistakes and so on.\n\n2:05:56.860 --> 2:05:58.080\n Many mistakes.\n\n2:05:59.700 --> 2:06:02.220\n Is that, are mistakes a bug or a feature?\n\n2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:05.220\n Like, do you recommend embrace the mistakes,\n\n2:06:05.220 --> 2:06:06.060\n make a bunch of them?\n\n2:06:06.060 --> 2:06:07.500\n Depends what they are, right?\n\n2:06:07.500 --> 2:06:08.340\n So.\n\n2:06:08.340 --> 2:06:09.900\n Well, you've had the full spectrum.\n\n2:06:09.900 --> 2:06:12.640\n I've had a lot, but a lot of mine could have sunk me.\n\n2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:13.480\n Right.\n\n2:06:13.480 --> 2:06:15.240\n Like, they sound like fun when I talk about them,\n\n2:06:15.240 --> 2:06:17.740\n but they actually could have sunk me.\n\n2:06:17.740 --> 2:06:21.380\n And they were all part of what made me funny,\n\n2:06:21.380 --> 2:06:22.860\n but I don't know.\n\n2:06:22.860 --> 2:06:25.020\n I would never tell anyone else\n\n2:06:25.020 --> 2:06:26.780\n to just light their life on fire\n\n2:06:26.780 --> 2:06:28.620\n and hope it all works out on the other end.\n\n2:06:28.620 --> 2:06:30.760\n It would be pretty irresponsible.\n\n2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:34.700\n But hey, at the end of the day, it's like,\n\n2:06:34.700 --> 2:06:39.080\n you're gonna, we get, there's, you know,\n\n2:06:39.080 --> 2:06:41.660\n I think one of my themes is that there's too much.\n\n2:06:41.660 --> 2:06:42.780\n We give the power.\n\n2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:46.180\n We think we have too, the power of choice\n\n2:06:46.180 --> 2:06:50.420\n has been elevated on our society to an unhealthy degree.\n\n2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:53.500\n I think people are, I think you could get really good\n\n2:06:53.500 --> 2:06:55.980\n at something, but you're born with a certain aptitude.\n\n2:06:55.980 --> 2:06:57.720\n It might be to be a deal maker,\n\n2:06:57.720 --> 2:06:58.860\n might be to be an athlete.\n\n2:06:58.860 --> 2:06:59.940\n It might be to be an artist.\n\n2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:01.660\n It might be to be a romantic,\n\n2:07:01.660 --> 2:07:03.240\n just fall in and out of love, in and out of love,\n\n2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:04.080\n in and out of love.\n\n2:07:04.080 --> 2:07:05.420\n It might be to be like a world traveler.\n\n2:07:05.420 --> 2:07:08.780\n Like, but whatever you are, I think you are.\n\n2:07:08.780 --> 2:07:10.380\n I think that there's something about you\n\n2:07:10.380 --> 2:07:11.980\n that makes you something.\n\n2:07:11.980 --> 2:07:13.700\n And if you can figure it out and then refine,\n\n2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:15.780\n you're not gonna be good at it per se.\n\n2:07:15.780 --> 2:07:17.660\n But if you're an athlete,\n\n2:07:17.660 --> 2:07:20.020\n it might not mean that you're going to be a great athlete\n\n2:07:20.020 --> 2:07:22.020\n in the history, but it might mean you're the best coach\n\n2:07:22.020 --> 2:07:24.580\n anyone's ever had, or you're the person that, you know,\n\n2:07:24.580 --> 2:07:27.460\n builds a local scene for young athletes or whatever.\n\n2:07:27.460 --> 2:07:30.100\n If you are a really good deal maker,\n\n2:07:30.100 --> 2:07:31.460\n it doesn't mean you're gonna be Warren Buffett,\n\n2:07:31.460 --> 2:07:33.920\n but it might mean you're somebody who enjoys\n\n2:07:33.920 --> 2:07:36.520\n making deals all the time and things like that.\n\n2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:38.220\n Like if you're an entertainer,\n\n2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:40.900\n it might mean that you are an entertainer.\n\n2:07:40.900 --> 2:07:43.220\n It might mean that you are in the world of entertainment\n\n2:07:43.220 --> 2:07:46.820\n because you love it so much that if you lack the skillset\n\n2:07:46.820 --> 2:07:49.060\n to really pursue it on a degree,\n\n2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:51.820\n you just want to be like, there's a thing\n\n2:07:51.820 --> 2:07:55.380\n inside of you that makes you what you are.\n\n2:07:55.380 --> 2:07:56.980\n I think, I look at certain people and I go,\n\n2:07:56.980 --> 2:07:59.220\n you were born to be that thing.\n\n2:07:59.220 --> 2:08:00.060\n You know?\n\n2:08:00.060 --> 2:08:01.260\n The whole purpose is to find it.\n\n2:08:01.260 --> 2:08:03.980\n I was a juror on that murder trial in Long Island\n\n2:08:03.980 --> 2:08:05.940\n and the woman who's the DA, I'm like,\n\n2:08:05.940 --> 2:08:07.280\n you were born to do this.\n\n2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:10.220\n You were born to put murderers away\n\n2:08:10.220 --> 2:08:12.340\n and this guy killed the mother of his children.\n\n2:08:12.340 --> 2:08:13.660\n I mean, he's a bad guy, but like, I was like,\n\n2:08:13.660 --> 2:08:15.580\n you are really good at what you do.\n\n2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:18.580\n She has a strong belief in whatever her moral code is\n\n2:08:18.580 --> 2:08:20.500\n and what her justice and ethics are.\n\n2:08:20.500 --> 2:08:22.100\n And she wants to communicate that to people.\n\n2:08:22.100 --> 2:08:25.820\n She was very good at doing what she did.\n\n2:08:25.820 --> 2:08:26.980\n I don't know the facts of the case.\n\n2:08:26.980 --> 2:08:27.820\n I didn't really listen.\n\n2:08:27.820 --> 2:08:29.640\n He seemed guilty, so I just voted guilty.\n\n2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:31.900\n But I didn't really listen to her,\n\n2:08:31.900 --> 2:08:34.260\n but I heard the shape of her mouth was very bovine,\n\n2:08:34.260 --> 2:08:36.860\n like a cow, and it conferred a certain level\n\n2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:39.100\n of expertise that I enjoyed.\n\n2:08:39.100 --> 2:08:39.940\n Well, it's funny.\n\n2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:42.980\n I mean, you could see, you're half joking.\n\n2:08:42.980 --> 2:08:43.820\n Yes, but I'm serious.\n\n2:08:43.820 --> 2:08:46.780\n You can often see that people just,\n\n2:08:46.780 --> 2:08:47.860\n they found their place.\n\n2:08:47.860 --> 2:08:48.820\n They found their role.\n\n2:08:48.820 --> 2:08:49.700\n They found their thing.\n\n2:08:49.700 --> 2:08:50.540\n They found their thing,\n\n2:08:50.540 --> 2:08:52.060\n and that's kind of the purpose of life.\n\n2:08:52.060 --> 2:08:55.780\n And once you are in a place that seems sticky,\n\n2:08:55.780 --> 2:08:58.340\n like the place that seems right,\n\n2:08:59.380 --> 2:09:01.140\n that's one of the problems with the generation\n\n2:09:01.140 --> 2:09:03.380\n that you're speaking to, is there's always a feeling\n\n2:09:03.380 --> 2:09:05.620\n like I should keep exploring, keep exploring.\n\n2:09:05.620 --> 2:09:08.980\n But it's okay to stay in a place that you found that works.\n\n2:09:08.980 --> 2:09:12.020\n Yeah, and listen, sometimes the best place you'll find\n\n2:09:12.020 --> 2:09:13.940\n is like when people are like,\n\n2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:15.900\n when did you feel really excited and alive?\n\n2:09:15.900 --> 2:09:18.020\n It's like doing nothing.\n\n2:09:18.020 --> 2:09:19.220\n Right, yeah.\n\n2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:20.940\n You know, like that's the other thing.\n\n2:09:20.940 --> 2:09:22.020\n It's like some people are gonna be like,\n\n2:09:22.020 --> 2:09:23.540\n I feel really excited and alive,\n\n2:09:23.540 --> 2:09:25.860\n and I'm laying in my backyard in a hammock.\n\n2:09:25.860 --> 2:09:27.460\n And I just wanted the simplest life\n\n2:09:27.460 --> 2:09:30.220\n and not have to do much, and I don't like doing anything.\n\n2:09:30.220 --> 2:09:31.620\n And I love laying around and going,\n\n2:09:31.620 --> 2:09:33.580\n wow, the sky looks good today.\n\n2:09:33.580 --> 2:09:34.940\n Bill Gates goes, the sky looks good today.\n\n2:09:34.940 --> 2:09:36.300\n Let's shoot a missile into it.\n\n2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:37.540\n He wants to do shit, right?\n\n2:09:37.540 --> 2:09:40.180\n So it's like in between that and nothing\n\n2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:42.020\n is you can find something.\n\n2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:45.620\n But in that process, for you personally,\n\n2:09:45.620 --> 2:09:49.500\n I mean, for me and for others, I think there's a struggle.\n\n2:09:49.500 --> 2:09:50.340\n When you look in the,\n\n2:09:50.340 --> 2:09:52.140\n when Tim and Dylan looks in the mirror,\n\n2:09:52.140 --> 2:09:54.820\n do you love yourself or do you hate yourself?\n\n2:09:54.820 --> 2:09:56.740\n Well, a lot of times I think I'm Amy Schumer,\n\n2:09:56.740 --> 2:09:58.060\n so I'm confused.\n\n2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:01.860\n I'm a detente to myself all the time.\n\n2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:03.100\n I don't love myself or hate myself.\n\n2:10:03.100 --> 2:10:06.940\n Addicts have a very bad problem\n\n2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:09.180\n where you can't just fall in love with yourself\n\n2:10:09.180 --> 2:10:10.460\n and you can't hate yourself.\n\n2:10:10.460 --> 2:10:12.700\n Both of them lead you to a negative place.\n\n2:10:12.700 --> 2:10:14.780\n You try to stay kind of even keel.\n\n2:10:14.780 --> 2:10:17.300\n I don't go like, hey man, you put out a video,\n\n2:10:17.300 --> 2:10:18.740\n get all these views, things are great.\n\n2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:19.820\n You sold a bunch of tickets.\n\n2:10:19.820 --> 2:10:21.740\n Let's fucking go out and like, maybe let's,\n\n2:10:21.740 --> 2:10:23.060\n hey man, let's have that drink\n\n2:10:23.060 --> 2:10:24.980\n that you've been waiting for for 11 years.\n\n2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:26.380\n And I don't look at myself and go,\n\n2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:27.580\n you ate a burger yesterday.\n\n2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:28.580\n You're a piece of shit.\n\n2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:29.780\n You're horrible.\n\n2:10:29.780 --> 2:10:33.260\n You'll never get into the shape you want.\n\n2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:35.100\n I try not to get too low or too high.\n\n2:10:35.100 --> 2:10:38.740\n Both of them are not good for my particular mind.\n\n2:10:38.740 --> 2:10:42.900\n Okay, I gotta ask, we kind of spoke about 2021\n\n2:10:42.900 --> 2:10:45.180\n and you being potentially hopeful,\n\n2:10:45.180 --> 2:10:48.740\n hopeful short term, cynical long term.\n\n2:10:48.740 --> 2:10:49.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:10:49.940 --> 2:10:54.180\n So let me ask, I forgot to ask, are you moving to Austin?\n\n2:10:54.180 --> 2:10:55.020\n I don't know.\n\n2:10:55.020 --> 2:10:57.540\n I mean, I don't think so immediately.\n\n2:10:57.540 --> 2:10:58.380\n I love Joe.\n\n2:10:58.380 --> 2:10:59.820\n I love what he's trying to do down there.\n\n2:10:59.820 --> 2:11:02.260\n I'm appreciative of everything that he's done\n\n2:11:02.260 --> 2:11:04.660\n for not only me, but for comedy in general.\n\n2:11:04.660 --> 2:11:06.580\n And I think as things happen in Austin\n\n2:11:06.580 --> 2:11:08.580\n and unfold is such a political answer,\n\n2:11:08.580 --> 2:11:11.340\n but as things unfold, I will consider it more and more.\n\n2:11:11.340 --> 2:11:14.460\n But I mean, I think I got another year in LA.\n\n2:11:14.460 --> 2:11:18.660\n So you've spoken so nicely about this magical place\n\n2:11:18.660 --> 2:11:20.020\n that is Los Angeles.\n\n2:11:20.020 --> 2:11:22.220\n LA is very funny.\n\n2:11:22.220 --> 2:11:24.460\n You think there's a place for comedy in LA?\n\n2:11:24.460 --> 2:11:25.860\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:11:25.860 --> 2:11:27.380\n There will always be a place for comedy in LA.\n\n2:11:27.380 --> 2:11:29.740\n So it's gonna be a place for comedy in New York.\n\n2:11:29.740 --> 2:11:32.340\n I mean, the question is how thriving of a comedy scene\n\n2:11:32.340 --> 2:11:33.620\n is Austin gonna be?\n\n2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:36.820\n And Joe can probably make it one,\n\n2:11:36.820 --> 2:11:38.620\n but as of right now, it isn't.\n\n2:11:38.620 --> 2:11:39.980\n So that would be him doing that.\n\n2:11:39.980 --> 2:11:42.300\n But the question, there's a lot of people escaping\n\n2:11:42.300 --> 2:11:44.780\n Los Angeles, but I know better about New York.\n\n2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:46.620\n There's a lot of really brilliant people.\n\n2:11:46.620 --> 2:11:47.460\n Let them go.\n\n2:11:47.460 --> 2:11:48.700\n There's other people.\n\n2:11:48.700 --> 2:11:49.540\n This is the thing.\n\n2:11:49.540 --> 2:11:50.700\n It's like, this is the fear thing.\n\n2:11:50.700 --> 2:11:53.100\n It's like, no, but all the brilliant people are leaving.\n\n2:11:53.100 --> 2:11:55.420\n There'll be other people and they'll fill their shoes\n\n2:11:55.420 --> 2:11:57.700\n the way that they've done throughout history.\n\n2:11:57.700 --> 2:11:59.540\n And I think that New York and LA,\n\n2:11:59.540 --> 2:12:00.900\n listen, maybe in five to 10 years,\n\n2:12:00.900 --> 2:12:02.380\n they're not the two cities.\n\n2:12:02.380 --> 2:12:05.220\n It would be real rough in five years\n\n2:12:05.220 --> 2:12:08.460\n when this pandemic's over for people in Australia to go,\n\n2:12:08.460 --> 2:12:10.420\n dude, you gotta go to America\n\n2:12:10.420 --> 2:12:13.220\n and you gotta visit Charleston and Austin.\n\n2:12:13.220 --> 2:12:14.060\n Stop.\n\n2:12:14.060 --> 2:12:15.180\n Let's be adults here.\n\n2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:16.260\n Let's be adults.\n\n2:12:16.260 --> 2:12:18.700\n It's still gonna be New York and LA for a while.\n\n2:12:18.700 --> 2:12:21.940\n LA is an absolute hellscape,\n\n2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:26.460\n but I don't think you're gonna replace California\n\n2:12:26.460 --> 2:12:28.980\n with another place.\n\n2:12:28.980 --> 2:12:30.660\n And also, everyone's making decisions now\n\n2:12:30.660 --> 2:12:32.460\n because we're literally in the midst of a pandemic\n\n2:12:32.460 --> 2:12:34.060\n we've never had before.\n\n2:12:34.060 --> 2:12:35.500\n We've never had this before.\n\n2:12:35.500 --> 2:12:37.940\n Joe loved California up until the pandemic.\n\n2:12:37.940 --> 2:12:39.220\n He had problems with it.\n\n2:12:39.220 --> 2:12:40.660\n Like, we all have problems with it.\n\n2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:42.420\n There's a lot of benefits to being here.\n\n2:12:42.420 --> 2:12:45.580\n I think a lot of us made pretty bad decisions in 2020\n\n2:12:45.580 --> 2:12:46.860\n because we were all locked up\n\n2:12:46.860 --> 2:12:48.940\n and stuck with our own thoughts.\n\n2:12:48.940 --> 2:12:52.060\n But, so it's funny, there's parallels\n\n2:12:52.060 --> 2:12:54.260\n because I don't necessarily,\n\n2:12:54.260 --> 2:12:55.940\n you know, I'm obviously a fan of comedy,\n\n2:12:55.940 --> 2:12:59.060\n but I don't care where comics move.\n\n2:12:59.060 --> 2:13:01.300\n But there's a parallel move that's happening,\n\n2:13:01.300 --> 2:13:04.380\n set of decisions which do influence my decision making,\n\n2:13:04.380 --> 2:13:07.700\n which is where to start a business that's tech centered.\n\n2:13:07.700 --> 2:13:12.180\n And that's more about the San Francisco, Silicon Valley.\n\n2:13:12.180 --> 2:13:15.180\n And there is a lot of people leaving there.\n\n2:13:15.180 --> 2:13:16.020\n That's already.\n\n2:13:16.020 --> 2:13:16.860\n And they're going to Austin.\n\n2:13:16.860 --> 2:13:19.900\n Well, Austin, there's a, I think,\n\n2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:21.340\n there's a bunch of different places.\n\n2:13:21.340 --> 2:13:23.380\n Phoenix, there's Denver.\n\n2:13:23.380 --> 2:13:26.780\n Austin will probably be a massive tech hub.\n\n2:13:26.780 --> 2:13:27.660\n Elon's there.\n\n2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:30.700\n It seems like it's all, everything about Austin says\n\n2:13:30.700 --> 2:13:33.220\n that it's going to be a massive tech hub.\n\n2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:34.220\n I just don't know if that means\n\n2:13:34.220 --> 2:13:35.580\n it'll be a massive comedy hub.\n\n2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:36.420\n It might.\n\n2:13:36.420 --> 2:13:38.420\n I don't know if those two can actually coexist.\n\n2:13:38.420 --> 2:13:39.620\n It's interesting because.\n\n2:13:39.620 --> 2:13:41.620\n Yeah, I don't, I think, you know,\n\n2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:43.060\n comedy suffered in New York and LA\n\n2:13:43.060 --> 2:13:45.380\n when everyone got super rich.\n\n2:13:45.380 --> 2:13:47.100\n Like, you know, it just wasn't as cool.\n\n2:13:47.100 --> 2:13:48.980\n It's still much more fun on the road.\n\n2:13:48.980 --> 2:13:50.540\n It's still more fun to perform for people\n\n2:13:50.540 --> 2:13:53.420\n that want and need to laugh in strip malls\n\n2:13:53.420 --> 2:13:55.740\n than it is to perform for hedge fund managers\n\n2:13:55.740 --> 2:13:59.220\n and with their dates and, you know, Instagram models in LA.\n\n2:13:59.220 --> 2:14:00.060\n It's just what it is.\n\n2:14:00.060 --> 2:14:01.700\n Comedy on the road is much more fun.\n\n2:14:01.700 --> 2:14:04.380\n So maybe in the spirit of that, Austin becomes,\n\n2:14:04.380 --> 2:14:06.940\n but you know, you know, if Austin is just colonized\n\n2:14:06.940 --> 2:14:08.900\n by tech bros and stuff like, yeah, I mean,\n\n2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:10.700\n sure, sure it'll be fun and it'll be great.\n\n2:14:10.700 --> 2:14:13.740\n I think Joe's made LA a scene.\n\n2:14:13.740 --> 2:14:16.380\n So if anyone's going to make Austin a scene, it's Joe.\n\n2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:20.060\n Yeah, and I like the, on the Elon side,\n\n2:14:20.060 --> 2:14:22.260\n which is what I'm much more familiar with,\n\n2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:25.540\n the promise of the possibility of what that could become\n\n2:14:25.540 --> 2:14:27.700\n because there's a lot of problems in Silicon Valley.\n\n2:14:27.700 --> 2:14:30.380\n And of course it might be naive to think that\n\n2:14:30.380 --> 2:14:33.060\n just because it's like the grass is greener thing,\n\n2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:36.220\n which is just because the place where you come from\n\n2:14:36.220 --> 2:14:37.420\n has a lot of problems,\n\n2:14:37.420 --> 2:14:39.140\n doesn't mean you can just create a new place\n\n2:14:39.140 --> 2:14:39.980\n that's not going to have those problems.\n\n2:14:39.980 --> 2:14:41.580\n Yeah, there's homelessness in Austin.\n\n2:14:41.580 --> 2:14:42.860\n There are problems in Austin.\n\n2:14:42.860 --> 2:14:44.860\n I mean, I think that with, by the way,\n\n2:14:44.860 --> 2:14:48.140\n with the influx of very rich people to an area,\n\n2:14:48.140 --> 2:14:49.180\n sometimes that helps things,\n\n2:14:49.180 --> 2:14:51.260\n but sometimes it just makes things more polarizing\n\n2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:53.460\n and it puts a spotlight on those problems\n\n2:14:53.460 --> 2:14:55.180\n and makes those problems even bigger, right?\n\n2:14:55.180 --> 2:14:58.060\n So, I mean, I don't know that it's necessarily,\n\n2:14:58.060 --> 2:14:59.180\n it's hard to predict.\n\n2:14:59.180 --> 2:15:01.060\n I just know that LA right now is funny.\n\n2:15:01.060 --> 2:15:03.020\n It's funny that there's 15 year old TikTokers\n\n2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:05.260\n making millions of dollars dancing in a house\n\n2:15:05.260 --> 2:15:06.420\n while the world burns.\n\n2:15:06.420 --> 2:15:07.340\n That is very funny.\n\n2:15:07.340 --> 2:15:11.140\n Well, it's for your style of humor, yes.\n\n2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:13.220\n The absurdity of the world is that it's...\n\n2:15:13.220 --> 2:15:15.380\n No one cares about Hollywood starlets\n\n2:15:15.380 --> 2:15:16.900\n and actresses and actors and everyone goes,\n\n2:15:16.900 --> 2:15:17.740\n hey, fuck you.\n\n2:15:17.740 --> 2:15:19.580\n Even though they've won three Academy Awards,\n\n2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:20.700\n they're all being replaced\n\n2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:23.980\n by just mediocre dancer 15 year olds.\n\n2:15:23.980 --> 2:15:25.500\n I mean, it's like there's something hilarious\n\n2:15:25.500 --> 2:15:28.580\n about this city and it will burn in hell,\n\n2:15:28.580 --> 2:15:29.660\n but so will everything.\n\n2:15:29.660 --> 2:15:31.980\n So what are we talking about?\n\n2:15:31.980 --> 2:15:34.620\n Eventually the sun will die out\n\n2:15:34.620 --> 2:15:37.420\n and we will all be gone unless we colonize\n\n2:15:37.420 --> 2:15:38.980\n outside of our solar system.\n\n2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:42.900\n But I just sit here,\n\n2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:43.900\n I'm struggling with this\n\n2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:46.540\n because Boston, I'm currently at MIT,\n\n2:15:46.540 --> 2:15:48.180\n Boston doesn't feel like the right place\n\n2:15:48.180 --> 2:15:52.700\n to start a business in the tech sector.\n\n2:15:52.700 --> 2:15:53.540\n And so I'm choosing,\n\n2:15:53.540 --> 2:15:55.500\n I'm looking at San Francisco the way it is\n\n2:15:55.500 --> 2:15:56.820\n and I'm looking at Austin.\n\n2:15:56.820 --> 2:15:58.340\n Oh, Austin, clearly.\n\n2:15:58.340 --> 2:16:02.900\n So it seems clear, but it's such a difficult thing\n\n2:16:02.900 --> 2:16:07.500\n to predict what a place will look like in 10 years\n\n2:16:07.500 --> 2:16:08.980\n and 15 years and 20 years.\n\n2:16:08.980 --> 2:16:10.940\n And it's so hard to predict if you'll like it or not\n\n2:16:10.940 --> 2:16:12.060\n until you're there.\n\n2:16:12.060 --> 2:16:14.260\n And this is speaking to risk,\n\n2:16:15.140 --> 2:16:18.180\n there's not really a good reason for me to move anywhere.\n\n2:16:18.180 --> 2:16:21.180\n There's not a good reason to do anything in life.\n\n2:16:21.180 --> 2:16:25.100\n Part of me wants to just fucking do it\n\n2:16:25.100 --> 2:16:26.340\n and whatever and see what happens.\n\n2:16:26.340 --> 2:16:28.380\n Do you like Boston, do you like other things about Boston\n\n2:16:28.380 --> 2:16:30.780\n besides the tech thing?\n\n2:16:30.780 --> 2:16:31.940\n You like MIT.\n\n2:16:31.940 --> 2:16:33.260\n MIT, that's the problem.\n\n2:16:33.260 --> 2:16:35.300\n Do you like the food in Boston?\n\n2:16:35.300 --> 2:16:36.140\n Do you eat food?\n\n2:16:36.140 --> 2:16:39.620\n I haven't eaten food or been outside for years.\n\n2:16:39.620 --> 2:16:42.900\n And I mean, that's probably the better version.\n\n2:16:42.900 --> 2:16:44.540\n But you're keto forever.\n\n2:16:44.540 --> 2:16:45.940\n You've been keto for a long time.\n\n2:16:45.940 --> 2:16:49.020\n Yeah, keto, fasting for a long time.\n\n2:16:49.020 --> 2:16:54.020\n 15 years fasting, eating once or twice a day.\n\n2:16:54.020 --> 2:16:59.020\n But no sugar ever, no like and no pasta ever, no bread ever.\n\n2:17:00.180 --> 2:17:05.180\n No pasta, no bread, no, except like, so my source of...\n\n2:17:05.180 --> 2:17:06.420\n You could kind of live anywhere\n\n2:17:06.420 --> 2:17:09.060\n because like going out is such a big part\n\n2:17:09.060 --> 2:17:10.180\n of what city you live in.\n\n2:17:10.180 --> 2:17:11.460\n And like, do you like the food there?\n\n2:17:11.460 --> 2:17:12.300\n Do you like the restaurants?\n\n2:17:12.300 --> 2:17:13.140\n Can you meet people?\n\n2:17:13.140 --> 2:17:15.580\n Whatever, but it's like, you really can just kind of...\n\n2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:17.420\n Yeah, so not married, no kids.\n\n2:17:17.420 --> 2:17:18.340\n Right, you have freedom.\n\n2:17:18.340 --> 2:17:19.460\n Me too, I have freedom.\n\n2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:23.980\n And that's, we have the curse of being vegan.\n\n2:17:23.980 --> 2:17:25.580\n We have too many choices.\n\n2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:26.420\n Right.\n\n2:17:26.420 --> 2:17:27.260\n That's the thing.\n\n2:17:27.260 --> 2:17:28.100\n We have too many choices.\n\n2:17:28.100 --> 2:17:29.620\n We don't have somebody else going, what about like,\n\n2:17:29.620 --> 2:17:31.860\n we don't have to justify our decisions to anyone.\n\n2:17:31.860 --> 2:17:34.540\n So we can just kind of like let our minds go run wild.\n\n2:17:34.540 --> 2:17:37.500\n So you just got to hone the instinct\n\n2:17:37.500 --> 2:17:40.940\n of just what feels right and just fucking do it.\n\n2:17:40.940 --> 2:17:41.780\n And that's it.\n\n2:17:41.780 --> 2:17:42.940\n I think Austin with Joe down there and Elon down there,\n\n2:17:42.940 --> 2:17:46.460\n Austin seems like a real no brainer move for you.\n\n2:17:46.460 --> 2:17:48.540\n To try, you know, why the hell not?\n\n2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:49.620\n Why not?\n\n2:17:49.620 --> 2:17:51.420\n And then I think I should go to MIT.\n\n2:17:51.420 --> 2:17:56.420\n Like, I mean, I think I should give those nerds\n\n2:17:56.940 --> 2:17:59.580\n a piece of my mind that you should go to.\n\n2:17:59.580 --> 2:18:02.580\n I was in an Uber pool once with a kid from MIT\n\n2:18:02.580 --> 2:18:05.100\n and I was eating this thing from Bova's Bakery.\n\n2:18:05.100 --> 2:18:06.020\n I forget what it was.\n\n2:18:06.020 --> 2:18:08.700\n It was like a, it's so good.\n\n2:18:08.700 --> 2:18:09.540\n I don't know.\n\n2:18:09.540 --> 2:18:10.660\n You don't know Bova's Bakery, right?\n\n2:18:10.660 --> 2:18:12.260\n Yeah, it's in Boston, it's famous.\n\n2:18:12.260 --> 2:18:14.220\n I was eating a thing and I was like covered in chocolate.\n\n2:18:14.220 --> 2:18:16.140\n This kid, like this little nerd, like this little like,\n\n2:18:16.140 --> 2:18:19.180\n you know, USB drive with feet was just staring at me\n\n2:18:19.180 --> 2:18:21.180\n and they just dropped him off at MIT.\n\n2:18:21.180 --> 2:18:22.740\n And he like scurried away.\n\n2:18:22.740 --> 2:18:23.860\n But that's a big school that,\n\n2:18:23.860 --> 2:18:25.740\n doesn't the NSA recruit out of their heavy,\n\n2:18:25.740 --> 2:18:27.740\n like MIT, places like that?\n\n2:18:27.740 --> 2:18:30.420\n I can't, I can't speak to that.\n\n2:18:30.420 --> 2:18:34.540\n But what, this is a ridiculous question\n\n2:18:34.540 --> 2:18:36.620\n I sometimes ask myself when I'm alone.\n\n2:18:36.620 --> 2:18:38.740\n What is the meaning of life?\n\n2:18:38.740 --> 2:18:41.820\n Do you think about the big existential kind of,\n\n2:18:41.820 --> 2:18:43.180\n why the hell we're here?\n\n2:18:43.180 --> 2:18:46.540\n It's a cosmic kind of joke kind of in a weird way, right?\n\n2:18:46.540 --> 2:18:49.300\n I mean, Joe said it the other day on,\n\n2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:51.500\n maybe it was you saying that like,\n\n2:18:51.500 --> 2:18:52.580\n he was just like, you know,\n\n2:18:52.580 --> 2:18:55.300\n by the time you figure out what it is, you're out of here.\n\n2:18:55.300 --> 2:18:56.620\n You know, it's kind of interesting.\n\n2:18:56.620 --> 2:18:58.300\n Or you even start to figure out what it is,\n\n2:18:58.300 --> 2:18:59.140\n you're out of here.\n\n2:18:59.140 --> 2:19:00.660\n It's like, that's kind of funny.\n\n2:19:00.660 --> 2:19:04.700\n It's like, you don't get enough time to truly,\n\n2:19:04.700 --> 2:19:06.740\n I think the meaning of life is just like,\n\n2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:11.980\n at the end of the day, do you feel it was time well spent?\n\n2:19:11.980 --> 2:19:13.220\n Was it time well spent?\n\n2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:16.460\n That's really what it is.\n\n2:19:16.460 --> 2:19:17.700\n If you look back, do you go,\n\n2:19:17.700 --> 2:19:20.580\n hey, it was time well spent.\n\n2:19:20.580 --> 2:19:21.420\n Pretty good ride.\n\n2:19:21.420 --> 2:19:22.260\n It was a pretty good ride.\n\n2:19:22.260 --> 2:19:25.580\n I did a lot of things.\n\n2:19:27.020 --> 2:19:30.420\n Doing what you say is a part of it, I think.\n\n2:19:30.420 --> 2:19:33.180\n If you say you're going to do something, maybe doing it.\n\n2:19:34.180 --> 2:19:38.060\n That seems to be extrapolating the meaning of life question\n\n2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:40.940\n to like, you know, what did you come here to do?\n\n2:19:40.940 --> 2:19:43.100\n I think it goes down deep of like, who are you\n\n2:19:43.100 --> 2:19:44.980\n and what do you want and you know,\n\n2:19:44.980 --> 2:19:47.060\n what are you suited to do and what?\n\n2:19:47.060 --> 2:19:51.260\n It does seem that like, the people who are most enlightened\n\n2:19:51.260 --> 2:19:54.340\n that I've ever met or read books by,\n\n2:19:54.340 --> 2:19:56.300\n they ultimately land on humor.\n\n2:19:56.300 --> 2:19:58.380\n Like, they don't take shit seriously.\n\n2:19:58.380 --> 2:20:01.060\n They embrace the absurdity of it all\n\n2:20:01.060 --> 2:20:04.780\n and just kind of laugh at it in this kind of simple way.\n\n2:20:04.780 --> 2:20:08.260\n So it does seem that humor is like,\n\n2:20:08.260 --> 2:20:12.340\n one of the fundamental truths of this universe we're in.\n\n2:20:12.340 --> 2:20:13.180\n And somehow.\n\n2:20:13.180 --> 2:20:14.420\n It's love, it's love.\n\n2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:16.860\n Humor can be love, right?\n\n2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:20.500\n People laughing, that that sound is kind of like,\n\n2:20:20.500 --> 2:20:22.260\n Carolyn Knapp, who wrote a book called,\n\n2:20:22.260 --> 2:20:25.780\n Drinking a Love Story, which is a really good book\n\n2:20:25.780 --> 2:20:27.820\n about not drinking.\n\n2:20:27.820 --> 2:20:29.500\n Drinking and then not drinking.\n\n2:20:29.500 --> 2:20:34.460\n And she said, you could understand things as love.\n\n2:20:34.460 --> 2:20:36.780\n I think one of the last lines of the thing is like,\n\n2:20:36.780 --> 2:20:39.460\n people talking about their experiences in life,\n\n2:20:39.460 --> 2:20:40.320\n that could be love.\n\n2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:41.740\n Like, you know, laughter is love.\n\n2:20:41.740 --> 2:20:43.960\n Like, I feel like love and finding it\n\n2:20:43.960 --> 2:20:46.380\n wherever you could find it is why we're here.\n\n2:20:46.380 --> 2:20:47.980\n That's that connection.\n\n2:20:47.980 --> 2:20:49.660\n And laughter can be love.\n\n2:20:49.660 --> 2:20:53.200\n And, you know, figuring out, you know,\n\n2:20:53.200 --> 2:20:56.100\n something that makes life better\n\n2:20:56.100 --> 2:20:57.860\n for a lot of people can be love.\n\n2:20:57.860 --> 2:20:59.260\n You know, whether it's a vaccine\n\n2:20:59.260 --> 2:21:02.180\n or a technological advancement or whatever.\n\n2:21:02.180 --> 2:21:04.380\n Like, you know, all of those things,\n\n2:21:04.380 --> 2:21:06.380\n I think, can be that feeling.\n\n2:21:06.380 --> 2:21:07.980\n And I think that's what's important.\n\n2:21:07.980 --> 2:21:11.380\n It connects you to a larger frequency, you know?\n\n2:21:11.380 --> 2:21:13.460\n I don't think there's a better way to end it, Tim.\n\n2:21:13.460 --> 2:21:15.740\n I hope you're one of the voices.\n\n2:21:15.740 --> 2:21:17.580\n I truly believe that your legacy\n\n2:21:17.580 --> 2:21:20.000\n would be one of the most important voices of our time,\n\n2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:22.900\n because you're fearless and challenging all the absurdity\n\n2:21:22.900 --> 2:21:27.900\n of the nonsense of our social and political discourse.\n\n2:21:28.500 --> 2:21:30.180\n So I hope you keep doing it.\n\n2:21:30.180 --> 2:21:31.000\n I'm a fan.\n\n2:21:31.000 --> 2:21:33.140\n I'm still a bit starstruck, so.\n\n2:21:33.140 --> 2:21:33.980\n I'll stop it.\n\n2:21:33.980 --> 2:21:38.420\n Listen, I was your intellectual capacity.\n\n2:21:38.420 --> 2:21:41.420\n Enjoying anything I do only underscores\n\n2:21:41.420 --> 2:21:43.120\n how truly fucked we are.\n\n2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:46.860\n But thank you very much.\n\n2:21:46.860 --> 2:21:49.220\n Yeah, thank you for talking today.\n\n2:21:49.220 --> 2:21:50.940\n Thank you, brother.\n\n2:21:50.940 --> 2:21:53.300\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Tim Dillon,\n\n2:21:53.300 --> 2:21:55.300\n and thank you to our sponsors.\n\n2:21:55.300 -->
