of the most innovative scholars\n\n00:06.840 --> 00:09.760\n of martial arts in the modern era.\n\n00:09.760 --> 00:11.780\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n00:11.780 --> 00:14.980\n Indeed hiring website, Audible audio books,\n\n00:14.980 --> 00:18.780\n ExpressVPN and Element electrolyte drink.\n\n00:18.780 --> 00:20.860\n Click the sponsor links to get a discount\n\n00:20.860 --> 00:22.900\n and to support this podcast.\n\n00:22.900 --> 00:24.960\n As a side note, let me say that I've gotten a chance\n\n00:24.960 --> 00:28.180\n to train with Ryan recently and to both discuss\n\n00:28.180 --> 00:32.480\n and try out on the mat his ideas about grappling and fighting.\n\n00:32.480 --> 00:35.120\n What struck me is his unapologetic drive\n\n00:35.120 --> 00:37.560\n to solve martial arts.\n\n00:37.560 --> 00:40.160\n It reminds me of the ambitious vision and effort\n\n00:40.160 --> 00:43.720\n of Google's DeepMind to solve intelligence.\n\n00:43.720 --> 00:46.320\n In Ryan's case, this isn't some out there\n\n00:46.320 --> 00:48.040\n martial arts guru talk.\n\n00:48.040 --> 00:51.480\n This is a style of thinking about the game of human chess,\n\n00:51.480 --> 00:55.080\n of seeking to define the rules and to engineer ways\n\n00:55.080 --> 00:58.120\n from first principles of escaping the constraints\n\n00:58.120 --> 00:59.560\n of those rules.\n\n00:59.560 --> 01:01.480\n This style of thinking is rare,\n\n01:01.480 --> 01:04.560\n but is ultimately the one that leads to the discovery\n\n01:04.560 --> 01:07.900\n of new revolutionary ideas.\n\n01:07.900 --> 01:10.560\n If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe to it anywhere\n\n01:10.560 --> 01:13.440\n or connect with me at Lex Friedman.\n\n01:13.440 --> 01:16.880\n And now here's my conversation with Ryan Hall.\n\n01:17.960 --> 01:21.160\n You're known as a systems thinker in martial arts,\n\n01:21.160 --> 01:25.520\n but you also, I think, are willing to think\n\n01:25.520 --> 01:28.180\n outside the rules of the game, outside of the system.\n\n01:29.120 --> 01:31.960\n When you're thinking about strategies\n\n01:31.960 --> 01:36.960\n of how to solve the particular problem of an opponent,\n\n01:37.000 --> 01:40.480\n whether that's jiu jitsu or in mixed martial arts,\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:41.840\n what's your process for doing that,\n\n01:41.840 --> 01:43.720\n for figuring out that puzzle?\n\n01:43.720 --> 01:45.720\n I would say, I don't know if I have a specific\n\n01:45.720 --> 01:48.560\n like A to B to C process for that sort of thing.\n\n01:48.560 --> 01:52.280\n I try to do my best to appreciate that.\n\n01:52.280 --> 01:54.260\n I think a lot of the thinking,\n\n01:54.260 --> 01:55.960\n or maybe not all the thinking,\n\n01:55.960 --> 01:58.840\n but a lot of great thinking on conflict,\n\n01:58.840 --> 02:03.720\n on battle, on war, on martial arts has been done already.\n\n02:03.720 --> 02:05.980\n Not that we don't have to do any sort of\n\n02:05.980 --> 02:08.760\n background investigation or reassessing of these ideas\n\n02:08.760 --> 02:10.660\n or axioms that have come down through things\n\n02:10.660 --> 02:13.360\n like the book of five rings or the art of war,\n\n02:13.360 --> 02:16.920\n or like von Clausewitz, even anything like that really,\n\n02:16.920 --> 02:21.680\n but is trying to understand the lessons of the past\n\n02:21.680 --> 02:26.080\n that I think oftentimes we don't take with us problem solving.\n\n02:26.080 --> 02:26.920\n We pay lip service.\n\n02:26.920 --> 02:28.080\n I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n02:28.080 --> 02:31.000\n You know, a victorious fighter, the great fighter,\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:32.960\n you know, he knows victory is there,\n\n02:32.960 --> 02:34.640\n then he seeks battle.\n\n02:34.640 --> 02:36.520\n Everyone else is looking for victory in battle.\n\n02:36.520 --> 02:37.360\n Yeah, moving on.\n\n02:37.360 --> 02:39.440\n And that's why I'm gonna double jab and throw my left hand.\n\n02:39.440 --> 02:42.080\n And I think a lot of times our actions\n\n02:42.080 --> 02:45.040\n don't reflect our stated belief structure.\n\n02:45.040 --> 02:47.160\n And I think that oftentimes you can tell\n\n02:47.160 --> 02:48.500\n what I believe really,\n\n02:48.500 --> 02:50.640\n or what my fundamental operating system is\n\n02:50.640 --> 02:52.440\n based on my actions, whether I'm aware,\n\n02:52.440 --> 02:53.960\n I have an operating system internally,\n\n02:53.960 --> 02:55.320\n whether I'm aware of it or not,\n\n02:55.320 --> 02:57.200\n or certainly whether I'm fully aware of it.\n\n02:57.200 --> 03:00.360\n So I guess when it comes to strategy,\n\n03:00.360 --> 03:02.640\n I try to think about how things interact.\n\n03:02.640 --> 03:04.000\n You mentioned systems thinking,\n\n03:04.000 --> 03:07.500\n and I try to do my best to understand how systems exist,\n\n03:07.500 --> 03:09.760\n but I think that systems have a fundamental strength\n\n03:09.760 --> 03:11.280\n and a fundamental weakness.\n\n03:11.280 --> 03:14.120\n They work how they work, and that's great,\n\n03:14.120 --> 03:15.580\n but they're readable.\n\n03:15.580 --> 03:19.140\n So if you are aware, if I am operating on a system\n\n03:19.140 --> 03:21.920\n of which you're not really read into,\n\n03:21.920 --> 03:26.760\n then I think oftentimes I can seem shockingly effective,\n\n03:26.760 --> 03:30.140\n particularly if my system preys on certain weaknesses\n\n03:30.140 --> 03:33.140\n that maybe you're given to.\n\n03:33.140 --> 03:36.580\n But what happens when you've read the same books that I have?\n\n03:36.580 --> 03:38.040\n I think that a lot of times\n\n03:38.040 --> 03:39.400\n that makes me deeply predictable.\n\n03:39.400 --> 03:41.560\n I think about systems in jiu jitsu,\n\n03:41.560 --> 03:46.500\n and a lot of times people think that they're doing jiu jitsu\n\n03:46.500 --> 03:48.640\n when in reality they are doing an expression of it.\n\n03:48.640 --> 03:51.520\n Let's say I'll use, there's the Marcelo Garcia system.\n\n03:51.520 --> 03:54.960\n There is the current Henzo Gracie system.\n\n03:54.960 --> 03:56.520\n There's the old Gracie Baja one.\n\n03:56.520 --> 04:00.640\n There's the Gracie Academy, classic Gracie jiu jitsu.\n\n04:00.640 --> 04:05.180\n There's the art of jiu jitsu, kind of autos approach.\n\n04:05.180 --> 04:07.800\n And there's some crossover between a lot of these,\n\n04:07.800 --> 04:12.800\n but oftentimes I think when it comes to understanding\n\n04:12.880 --> 04:14.480\n how I'm making decisions\n\n04:14.480 --> 04:16.240\n and how my opponent is making decisions,\n\n04:16.240 --> 04:19.000\n I have to appreciate whether or not I'm an end user\n\n04:19.000 --> 04:21.520\n of something, and I'll use my phone as an example.\n\n04:21.520 --> 04:22.960\n I was thinking of this the other day,\n\n04:22.960 --> 04:25.320\n and as an end user of my phone, I can't,\n\n04:25.320 --> 04:27.080\n I have no idea what it does.\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:28.420\n Like Edward Snowden comes up and goes,\n\n04:28.420 --> 04:30.480\n ''Hey guys, you realize your phones are listening to you.''\n\n04:30.480 --> 04:33.120\n I'm like, ''Really, what?\n\n04:33.120 --> 04:34.260\n All right, I believe you.''\n\n04:34.260 --> 04:35.900\n And then of course that comes out,\n\n04:35.900 --> 04:37.680\n but to what extent?\n\n04:37.680 --> 04:38.580\n I have no idea.\n\n04:39.800 --> 04:40.920\n What is my phone capable of?\n\n04:40.920 --> 04:41.960\n I have no idea.\n\n04:41.960 --> 04:43.080\n I can mess with the font though.\n\n04:43.080 --> 04:45.380\n I really like blue screens, not purple screens.\n\n04:45.380 --> 04:47.680\n So as an end user, I can change some of the bells\n\n04:47.680 --> 04:49.060\n and whistles that have nothing to do\n\n04:49.060 --> 04:50.600\n with the underlying source code of it all\n\n04:50.600 --> 04:51.440\n or how it functions.\n\n04:51.440 --> 04:53.440\n The same way in my car, I'm an end user of my car.\n\n04:53.440 --> 04:55.320\n If I do this with the steering wheel, it goes.\n\n04:55.320 --> 04:56.760\n If I push on the gas, it goes.\n\n04:58.280 --> 04:59.600\n I know how to fix it when it's out of gas.\n\n04:59.600 --> 05:01.140\n I know how to fix it when it's out of oil.\n\n05:01.140 --> 05:04.600\n And I know how to fix it when a flat tire comes.\n\n05:04.600 --> 05:07.520\n But short of that, or actually beyond that, I have nothing.\n\n05:07.520 --> 05:09.760\n So I think that oftentimes,\n\n05:09.760 --> 05:11.440\n I've been around in jiu jitsu long enough\n\n05:11.440 --> 05:14.620\n to encounter a new wave of good grapplers.\n\n05:14.620 --> 05:16.200\n And it's very, very interesting sometimes\n\n05:16.200 --> 05:17.740\n how they're running systems\n\n05:17.740 --> 05:19.160\n they don't realize they're running.\n\n05:19.160 --> 05:20.000\n Like, I'm like, oh yeah,\n\n05:20.000 --> 05:23.240\n I trained at Marcelo Garcia's Academy for a long time.\n\n05:23.240 --> 05:25.660\n And a big fan of Marcelo's was a student there.\n\n05:26.540 --> 05:29.240\n Encountered a lot of the auto style jiu jitsu\n\n05:29.240 --> 05:31.040\n a number of years ago.\n\n05:31.040 --> 05:35.200\n Been very, very deep into foot locking and leg attacks\n\n05:35.200 --> 05:38.040\n and whatnot for a long, long time.\n\n05:38.040 --> 05:40.360\n I understand your system better than you do, or I may.\n\n05:40.360 --> 05:42.720\n And let's say you understand my system better than I do.\n\n05:42.720 --> 05:43.640\n That would be a huge issue.\n\n05:43.640 --> 05:45.920\n That was something that I encountered a long time ago,\n\n05:45.920 --> 05:47.120\n trying to come up in jiu jitsu\n\n05:47.120 --> 05:50.460\n where I was trying to utilize systems\n\n05:50.460 --> 05:54.160\n that were created by, let's say Hoffa Mendez\n\n05:54.160 --> 05:55.000\n or someone else.\n\n05:55.000 --> 05:56.720\n And I'm basically trying to do what you're doing.\n\n05:56.720 --> 05:58.640\n I'm just not doing as good of a version of it.\n\n05:58.640 --> 06:00.520\n So not only am I not doing it well,\n\n06:00.520 --> 06:02.340\n but I'm entirely predictable.\n\n06:02.340 --> 06:03.920\n And I think that that can be a big issue.\n\n06:03.920 --> 06:06.620\n So to come back, I think of systems a lot of times now\n\n06:06.620 --> 06:09.240\n in terms of, particularly like end user type of systems,\n\n06:09.240 --> 06:11.760\n like an iPhone is a really, really fast way\n\n06:11.760 --> 06:14.120\n for me to be able to do all sorts of things.\n\n06:14.120 --> 06:15.240\n If you were to take it from me,\n\n06:15.240 --> 06:17.120\n I couldn't recreate any of that.\n\n06:17.120 --> 06:20.320\n So you want to be more the NSA and less the end user.\n\n06:20.320 --> 06:21.240\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n06:21.240 --> 06:22.080\n That way I'm listening to you.\n\n06:22.080 --> 06:23.960\n You want to be the NSA of combat.\n\n06:23.960 --> 06:25.440\n That's right, we're watching UP.\n\n06:25.440 --> 06:29.880\n But basically, I guess what I would come back and say\n\n06:29.880 --> 06:32.280\n is if you understand how things interact\n\n06:32.280 --> 06:35.220\n on a fundamental level and what type of games exist\n\n06:35.220 --> 06:36.840\n and what type of interactions exist,\n\n06:36.840 --> 06:40.020\n then you can transcend a lot of the systems.\n\n06:40.020 --> 06:42.840\n It's almost like a cook versus if I can make certain things\n\n06:42.840 --> 06:45.400\n in the kitchen, but I am not a chef.\n\n06:45.400 --> 06:47.000\n You could give me a bunch of ingredients\n\n06:47.000 --> 06:49.700\n and I could probably cook not well,\n\n06:49.700 --> 06:51.360\n but a couple of different things.\n\n06:51.360 --> 06:55.680\n But a master chef would be aware of the implications\n\n06:55.680 --> 06:57.540\n of all of the things that they're doing,\n\n06:57.540 --> 07:00.240\n extra time in the oven, less time in the oven,\n\n07:00.240 --> 07:03.160\n putting this flavoring or spice in,\n\n07:03.160 --> 07:04.720\n what you're doing with various things.\n\n07:04.720 --> 07:06.960\n And also they could turn all of these ingredients\n\n07:06.960 --> 07:07.800\n into Chinese food.\n\n07:07.800 --> 07:09.120\n They could turn all these ingredients into Italian food\n\n07:09.120 --> 07:10.760\n and they could turn all these Italian food ingredients\n\n07:10.760 --> 07:13.560\n into chicken Parmesan or it could turn into lasagna.\n\n07:13.560 --> 07:16.120\n But they're not limited to a specific thing\n\n07:16.120 --> 07:18.880\n because they have knowledge of how food interacts,\n\n07:18.880 --> 07:20.080\n what it does to create taste,\n\n07:20.080 --> 07:21.440\n what it does to create texture.\n\n07:21.440 --> 07:24.200\n So to come back, let's take rock, paper, scissors.\n\n07:24.200 --> 07:26.760\n Rock, paper, scissors is built on the idea\n\n07:26.760 --> 07:28.040\n of a couple of different things.\n\n07:28.040 --> 07:28.880\n Or actually, I'll tell you what,\n\n07:28.880 --> 07:31.240\n can I ask you a question?\n\n07:31.240 --> 07:32.700\n What's your favorite dinosaur?\n\n07:32.700 --> 07:34.040\n On the same, on three, we'll go.\n\n07:34.040 --> 07:37.120\n One, two, three.\n\n07:37.120 --> 07:37.960\n T. Rex.\n\n07:37.960 --> 07:40.480\n So me too, man, we're gonna be best friends.\n\n07:40.480 --> 07:45.080\n So it's, okay, so what's the first question\n\n07:45.080 --> 07:46.480\n when you say, hey, let's play rock, paper, scissors?\n\n07:46.480 --> 07:47.680\n It's like, hey, is it rock, paper, scissors\n\n07:47.680 --> 07:49.240\n or rock, paper, scissors, shoot?\n\n07:49.240 --> 07:50.680\n And you're like, rock, paper, scissors, shoot.\n\n07:50.680 --> 07:51.520\n You're like, okay.\n\n07:51.520 --> 07:55.480\n Because if we go rock, paper, scissors, shoot,\n\n07:55.480 --> 07:58.080\n and I'm like, oh man, I got lucky and I won.\n\n07:58.080 --> 08:00.400\n Imagine I won 100 times in a row.\n\n08:00.400 --> 08:01.240\n Yeah.\n\n08:01.240 --> 08:04.240\n It'd be luck, it'd be luck if I was honestly doing that.\n\n08:04.240 --> 08:05.560\n But now let's say, for instance,\n\n08:05.560 --> 08:08.160\n I go on rock, paper, scissors and you go on shoot.\n\n08:08.160 --> 08:11.600\n Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.\n\n08:11.600 --> 08:12.840\n Here comes the rock, right?\n\n08:12.840 --> 08:15.760\n If you lose, whose fault is it?\n\n08:15.760 --> 08:17.120\n It's yours.\n\n08:17.120 --> 08:18.920\n This is built on a parody thing\n\n08:18.920 --> 08:22.600\n where I don't get to pick second.\n\n08:22.600 --> 08:24.120\n If I get to pick second,\n\n08:24.120 --> 08:26.320\n it's like being able to investigate your background\n\n08:26.320 --> 08:27.260\n before going to meet you.\n\n08:27.260 --> 08:28.360\n And then I'm like, oh, hi.\n\n08:28.360 --> 08:30.440\n Oh, I too love the New Jersey, you know,\n\n08:30.440 --> 08:32.400\n the New Jersey Nets, which is a statement\n\n08:32.400 --> 08:34.440\n that no one in their right mind would ever make\n\n08:34.440 --> 08:35.760\n when I was growing up.\n\n08:35.760 --> 08:37.880\n So anyway, you'd have to have personal knowledge\n\n08:37.880 --> 08:38.800\n of somebody.\n\n08:38.800 --> 08:40.320\n So anyway, to come back,\n\n08:40.320 --> 08:43.900\n if you understand how games are structured,\n\n08:45.200 --> 08:48.120\n you can start to realize that there's huge gaps\n\n08:48.120 --> 08:51.700\n and huge holes in a lot of the thinking behind all of it.\n\n08:51.700 --> 08:54.000\n And if you can create the illusion of choice,\n\n08:54.000 --> 08:55.240\n I'll play one more if you don't mind.\n\n08:55.240 --> 08:56.080\n This is one of my favorite ones.\n\n08:56.080 --> 08:57.840\n I do this in class all the time.\n\n08:57.840 --> 08:58.840\n Have you seen this before?\n\n08:58.840 --> 08:59.680\n No.\n\n08:59.680 --> 09:01.360\n Okay, may I ask you some questions please?\n\n09:01.360 --> 09:02.200\n Sure.\n\n09:02.200 --> 09:03.040\n Okay, fantastic.\n\n09:03.040 --> 09:03.880\n I'm scared.\n\n09:03.880 --> 09:04.840\n Oh, there's, everybody wins.\n\n09:04.840 --> 09:05.680\n Don't worry.\n\n09:05.680 --> 09:06.520\n All right.\n\n09:06.520 --> 09:07.600\n So could you please?\n\n09:07.600 --> 09:08.760\n I win.\n\n09:08.760 --> 09:11.000\n Could you please pick three fingers\n\n09:11.000 --> 09:12.480\n and tell me what they are?\n\n09:12.480 --> 09:13.320\n Your thumb.\n\n09:13.320 --> 09:14.280\n Okay.\n\n09:14.280 --> 09:15.440\n Your pinky.\n\n09:15.440 --> 09:16.260\n Okay.\n\n09:16.260 --> 09:17.160\n And your middle finger.\n\n09:17.160 --> 09:18.260\n Okay.\n\n09:18.260 --> 09:20.200\n So could you please pick two fingers?\n\n09:21.400 --> 09:24.120\n Your middle finger and your pinky.\n\n09:24.120 --> 09:26.080\n Okay, could you please pick one finger?\n\n09:27.280 --> 09:28.720\n I'll go with the middle finger.\n\n09:28.720 --> 09:29.560\n Woo hoo.\n\n09:29.560 --> 09:31.840\n Okay, could you please pick one finger?\n\n09:31.840 --> 09:32.680\n Pinky.\n\n09:32.680 --> 09:34.360\n Okay, let's play again.\n\n09:34.360 --> 09:35.960\n Can you pick one finger, please?\n\n09:40.320 --> 09:41.720\n Your middle finger.\n\n09:41.720 --> 09:43.480\n Okay, can you pick one finger, please?\n\n09:43.480 --> 09:45.080\n Your thumb.\n\n09:45.080 --> 09:46.400\n Yeah, your pinky.\n\n09:47.720 --> 09:50.360\n Okay, now pick two more fingers, please.\n\n09:50.360 --> 09:53.680\n Your middle finger and your ring finger.\n\n09:53.680 --> 09:54.600\n Okay.\n\n09:54.600 --> 09:56.120\n Could you please pick one more finger?\n\n09:56.120 --> 09:57.060\n Damn it.\n\n09:57.060 --> 09:57.900\n So.\n\n09:57.900 --> 10:00.800\n I thought that enhanced the illusion of choice.\n\n10:00.800 --> 10:02.240\n It's the illusion of choice.\n\n10:02.240 --> 10:04.720\n If I'm asking the questions,\n\n10:04.720 --> 10:07.000\n provided I ask the right questions,\n\n10:07.000 --> 10:09.240\n there can be no correct answer.\n\n10:09.240 --> 10:11.120\n Doesn't mean that, I mean, ultimately,\n\n10:11.120 --> 10:13.080\n if that's what you wanted, let's say,\n\n10:13.080 --> 10:15.320\n like I thought I was guiding you to something I wanted,\n\n10:15.320 --> 10:17.440\n it turns out that was the outcome you wanted.\n\n10:17.440 --> 10:19.140\n Now I'm gonna ask the wrong questions.\n\n10:19.140 --> 10:20.320\n I might not get what I wanted, so.\n\n10:20.320 --> 10:22.560\n Oh, by the way, sorry to interrupt.\n\n10:22.560 --> 10:25.300\n For people that might be just listening to this,\n\n10:25.300 --> 10:28.400\n that no matter what trajectory we took\n\n10:28.400 --> 10:30.640\n through that decision tree that Ryan was presenting,\n\n10:30.640 --> 10:32.360\n it was always ending up with a middle finger,\n\n10:32.360 --> 10:34.120\n ironically enough.\n\n10:34.120 --> 10:35.720\n I was surprised.\n\n10:35.720 --> 10:37.080\n So, and.\n\n10:37.080 --> 10:39.600\n All of us were surprised, and we're both winners.\n\n10:39.600 --> 10:41.400\n Yeah, we all, everyone was.\n\n10:41.400 --> 10:42.640\n I felt like a winner.\n\n10:42.640 --> 10:44.280\n All right, so now I'm gonna,\n\n10:44.280 --> 10:47.080\n now I'll ask some different questions, if you don't mind.\n\n10:47.080 --> 10:49.280\n Can you please pick two fingers to put down?\n\n10:51.840 --> 10:54.080\n Your middle finger and your pinky.\n\n10:54.080 --> 10:54.920\n All right, sorry.\n\n10:54.920 --> 10:55.760\n Oh, that's so awkward.\n\n10:55.760 --> 10:57.600\n That's like the worst finger positions.\n\n10:57.600 --> 10:59.240\n Okay, can you please pick, wait a minute.\n\n10:59.240 --> 11:00.960\n That's, oh, hold on.\n\n11:00.960 --> 11:01.800\n Yeah.\n\n11:01.800 --> 11:04.600\n Well, what if you picked two other fingers to put down?\n\n11:05.800 --> 11:06.800\n Your thumb and your pinky.\n\n11:06.800 --> 11:07.840\n Okay, my thumb and my pinky.\n\n11:07.840 --> 11:10.040\n Can you please pick two fingers to put down?\n\n11:11.840 --> 11:12.680\n Well.\n\n11:12.680 --> 11:14.000\n Whatever two you like.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.920\n Okay, your middle finger and your pointy finger.\n\n11:16.920 --> 11:19.880\n Ah, okay, can you pick two fingers to put down?\n\n11:19.880 --> 11:20.720\n What's the name?\n\n11:20.720 --> 11:21.540\n It's index finger.\n\n11:21.540 --> 11:22.380\n Index finger.\n\n11:22.380 --> 11:23.200\n Why did I call it the pointy finger?\n\n11:23.200 --> 11:24.040\n Pointy, it's the pointy one.\n\n11:24.040 --> 11:24.880\n That's the one we usually point.\n\n11:24.880 --> 11:27.340\n It's weird to point with the ring finger.\n\n11:27.340 --> 11:28.180\n Sorry, what?\n\n11:28.180 --> 11:29.580\n Two more to put down, please.\n\n11:30.960 --> 11:32.840\n The middle finger and the ring finger.\n\n11:32.840 --> 11:34.640\n Ah, man.\n\n11:34.640 --> 11:38.040\n What if you pick my ring finger and my index finger?\n\n11:38.040 --> 11:38.880\n Yeah.\n\n11:38.880 --> 11:40.480\n Aha, woohoo, I win.\n\n11:40.480 --> 11:42.240\n So even though I'm asking the questions,\n\n11:42.240 --> 11:45.200\n it's not impossible that I arrive at a good outcome for me,\n\n11:45.200 --> 11:47.000\n but it's no longer guaranteed.\n\n11:47.000 --> 11:49.680\n I went from a situation where I literally can't lose.\n\n11:49.680 --> 11:51.640\n Yeah, it's pretty low probability.\n\n11:51.640 --> 11:53.200\n Right, super low probability.\n\n11:53.200 --> 11:54.960\n And the second you realize what I'm doing,\n\n11:54.960 --> 11:56.320\n you would never let me win\n\n11:56.320 --> 11:58.160\n because the ball's truly in your court.\n\n11:58.160 --> 12:01.640\n So I guess that's kind of what I'm fundamentally trying\n\n12:01.640 --> 12:03.880\n to put into play almost all the time.\n\n12:03.880 --> 12:05.820\n Can I ask the right set of questions?\n\n12:05.820 --> 12:10.520\n Can I develop the ability skills wise, understanding wise,\n\n12:10.520 --> 12:11.920\n and then discipline wise,\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:14.420\n and then have the courage and the constitution\n\n12:14.420 --> 12:16.200\n and the discipline necessary,\n\n12:16.200 --> 12:20.140\n the patience necessary to ask the proper questions\n\n12:20.140 --> 12:22.000\n and wait for the proper answers?\n\n12:22.000 --> 12:24.080\n And if I can,\n\n12:24.080 --> 12:29.080\n assuming the perfect world, I win, period.\n\n12:29.960 --> 12:30.920\n Yeah, so does that make sense?\n\n12:30.920 --> 12:32.080\n Yeah, that totally makes sense.\n\n12:32.080 --> 12:33.760\n So I don't know if you know\n\n12:33.760 --> 12:36.800\n sort of the more mathematical discipline of game theory.\n\n12:36.800 --> 12:39.160\n There's something called mechanism design.\n\n12:39.160 --> 12:43.860\n So game theory is this field where you model\n\n12:43.860 --> 12:46.240\n some kind of interaction between human beings.\n\n12:46.240 --> 12:48.160\n You could model grappling that way.\n\n12:48.160 --> 12:52.080\n You can model nuclear conflict between nations that way.\n\n12:52.080 --> 12:56.080\n And you set up a set of rules and incentives\n\n12:56.080 --> 13:00.160\n and then use math to predict\n\n13:00.160 --> 13:03.840\n what is likely outcome depending over time\n\n13:03.840 --> 13:06.240\n based on the interaction given those rules.\n\n13:06.240 --> 13:11.240\n Mechanism design is the design of games.\n\n13:11.640 --> 13:14.020\n So like the design of systems\n\n13:14.020 --> 13:18.540\n that are likely to lead to a certain outcome.\n\n13:18.540 --> 13:21.060\n And so what you're suggesting is\n\n13:21.060 --> 13:26.060\n you want to discover systems whose decision tree,\n\n13:27.640 --> 13:29.620\n all the possible things that could happen,\n\n13:29.620 --> 13:32.540\n feel like there's choice being made,\n\n13:32.540 --> 13:36.040\n but ultimately one of the parties\n\n13:36.040 --> 13:37.880\n doesn't have any choice\n\n13:37.880 --> 13:39.800\n in what the actual final outcome is.\n\n13:40.840 --> 13:43.700\n You're making them feel like they're playing a game too.\n\n13:43.700 --> 13:46.660\n So it's not like you don't feel trapped.\n\n13:46.660 --> 13:47.500\n It's kind of like.\n\n13:47.500 --> 13:50.880\n Well, the best traps, you don't look very threatening.\n\n13:50.880 --> 13:52.840\n So I'm like, oh, I'll walk over there.\n\n13:52.840 --> 13:55.000\n I guess wouldn't that,\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:56.400\n I guess that's kind of an interesting thing.\n\n13:56.400 --> 13:58.800\n If a lion, when does a lion roar?\n\n13:58.800 --> 14:01.600\n It's an interesting thing when you watch like lions hunting.\n\n14:01.600 --> 14:03.680\n Don't roar when they hunt.\n\n14:03.680 --> 14:05.280\n They want to, when they want to move you back,\n\n14:05.280 --> 14:06.200\n they do stuff like that.\n\n14:06.200 --> 14:08.320\n When they actually want to come and get you,\n\n14:08.320 --> 14:09.320\n they're pretty slinky.\n\n14:09.320 --> 14:10.520\n It's like water covered.\n\n14:10.520 --> 14:12.280\n It's like furry water.\n\n14:12.280 --> 14:15.120\n And I guess like when you keep that in mind,\n\n14:16.440 --> 14:18.960\n it's funny how, like for us a hobby actually,\n\n14:18.960 --> 14:21.040\n a brilliant guy, like one of my MMA coaches\n\n14:21.040 --> 14:22.880\n and the head coach at TriStar,\n\n14:22.880 --> 14:23.800\n he brought this up one time.\n\n14:23.800 --> 14:25.040\n I thought it was a really salient point.\n\n14:25.040 --> 14:27.800\n Said, let's say we have a million person bracket.\n\n14:27.800 --> 14:28.880\n Impossibly huge.\n\n14:28.880 --> 14:31.840\n Like Frank Dukes went in the Kumite level huge bracket.\n\n14:31.840 --> 14:34.920\n He claimed to knock out like 250 consecutive people.\n\n14:34.920 --> 14:38.120\n And you're like, that is all of Hong Kong\n\n14:38.120 --> 14:38.960\n was in that thing.\n\n14:38.960 --> 14:40.360\n And everyone kept their mouth shut.\n\n14:40.360 --> 14:41.680\n But anyway, that's pretty cool.\n\n14:41.680 --> 14:45.360\n But to come back a little improbable, pretty cool.\n\n14:45.360 --> 14:48.000\n So let's say for instance, like there's no cheating going on,\n\n14:48.000 --> 14:51.040\n no cheating going on and we're flipping coins, right?\n\n14:51.040 --> 14:54.520\n Someone is gonna have an unbroken string of victory\n\n14:54.520 --> 14:57.960\n through that bracket, which is pretty insane.\n\n14:57.960 --> 15:01.280\n How many consecutive like toss ups this person won.\n\n15:01.280 --> 15:04.040\n And then at the end of it all,\n\n15:04.040 --> 15:07.480\n imagine like aliens show up and we go,\n\n15:07.480 --> 15:09.880\n hey, they wanna flip a coin for whether or not Earth,\n\n15:09.880 --> 15:12.640\n whether or not Earth gets to continue.\n\n15:12.640 --> 15:15.040\n They'd be like, oh, I'll do it.\n\n15:15.040 --> 15:17.160\n I'm good at this.\n\n15:17.160 --> 15:19.160\n That would be tempting as a person to do.\n\n15:19.160 --> 15:20.960\n You're like, I'm a lucky guy.\n\n15:20.960 --> 15:22.280\n Are you sure?\n\n15:22.280 --> 15:23.680\n Maybe, I mean, maybe effectively you are.\n\n15:23.680 --> 15:25.400\n We could argue that effectively you're incredibly lucky.\n\n15:25.400 --> 15:27.320\n But basically is that an actual ability?\n\n15:27.320 --> 15:28.600\n Is that like a perk in a video game\n\n15:28.600 --> 15:30.120\n or is that just this thing that happened?\n\n15:30.120 --> 15:33.720\n So anyway, how many times are someone,\n\n15:33.720 --> 15:35.760\n you could go through an entire career,\n\n15:35.760 --> 15:37.840\n particularly in a fight sport.\n\n15:37.840 --> 15:39.400\n Well, let's say you get 15 knockouts\n\n15:39.400 --> 15:41.040\n and 15 toss up scenarios.\n\n15:41.040 --> 15:42.360\n Cause you see that happening all the time\n\n15:42.360 --> 15:43.720\n in the fight game, a toss up scenario.\n\n15:43.720 --> 15:45.200\n It's not like you're mounted on me\n\n15:45.200 --> 15:47.480\n and that's not a toss up scenario.\n\n15:47.480 --> 15:49.400\n Many, many, many, many, many striking scenarios.\n\n15:49.400 --> 15:50.240\n A lot of grappling ones,\n\n15:50.240 --> 15:53.120\n but tons of striking scenarios are dead toss ups.\n\n15:53.120 --> 15:55.680\n And somebody wins by knockout.\n\n15:55.680 --> 15:56.520\n They win five times in a row.\n\n15:56.520 --> 15:58.000\n Then they lose a couple of times in a row.\n\n15:58.000 --> 15:58.840\n We go, what happened?\n\n15:58.840 --> 15:59.760\n You're like, what do you mean what happened?\n\n15:59.760 --> 16:00.960\n They were always flipping the coin.\n\n16:00.960 --> 16:03.680\n And then they win five more and they go, ah, back on track.\n\n16:03.680 --> 16:04.520\n Can you imagine that?\n\n16:04.520 --> 16:05.360\n You're flipping a coin.\n\n16:05.360 --> 16:06.760\n I'm like heads, heads, heads, heads, tails.\n\n16:06.760 --> 16:07.600\n What?\n\n16:07.600 --> 16:09.000\n Tails, tails, heads again.\n\n16:09.000 --> 16:09.840\n Oh man, I'm back on it.\n\n16:09.840 --> 16:11.040\n I'm flipping good now.\n\n16:11.040 --> 16:12.840\n That's basically what's going on.\n\n16:12.840 --> 16:14.440\n I think the vast majority of the time\n\n16:14.440 --> 16:17.440\n and then humanity's tendency to see a sign\n\n16:17.440 --> 16:20.920\n in almost anything, it starts to present itself.\n\n16:20.920 --> 16:22.600\n And then we build a narrative in our mind\n\n16:22.600 --> 16:25.480\n to convince ourselves that we're in some sort of control.\n\n16:25.480 --> 16:27.880\n When in reality, I was in a marginal situation\n\n16:27.880 --> 16:30.080\n at best the whole time.\n\n16:30.080 --> 16:31.320\n Yeah, without having much control,\n\n16:31.320 --> 16:33.200\n without having a deep understanding of the system.\n\n16:33.200 --> 16:35.120\n The same story is told in the stock market.\n\n16:35.120 --> 16:38.200\n With many of these distributed human systems,\n\n16:38.200 --> 16:40.960\n we start telling narratives and start seeing patterns\n\n16:40.960 --> 16:43.440\n without understanding actually the system\n\n16:43.440 --> 16:44.680\n that's generating these patterns.\n\n16:44.680 --> 16:47.120\n So if we can see the system, that's incredibly valuable,\n\n16:47.120 --> 16:47.960\n but then you go, well,\n\n16:47.960 --> 16:49.920\n what system is above all of the systems?\n\n16:49.920 --> 16:52.320\n And I guess maybe physics, maybe something like game theory\n\n16:52.320 --> 16:54.520\n explains these things with like, I guess what are the,\n\n16:54.520 --> 16:57.000\n what aspects of the system can I put my hands on\n\n16:57.000 --> 16:58.440\n that I can touch and understand?\n\n16:58.440 --> 17:00.120\n And what am I missing?\n\n17:00.120 --> 17:02.160\n What's going on in the world all around me\n\n17:02.160 --> 17:06.080\n to continue to lean on Dune that I don't have,\n\n17:06.080 --> 17:09.320\n you talk to a blind person about the world,\n\n17:09.320 --> 17:12.160\n about the site and talk to someone that doesn't have everyone\n\n17:12.160 --> 17:14.520\n who's got coronavirus now, so no one can taste or smell.\n\n17:14.520 --> 17:17.680\n They're like, this is delicious, like, is it?\n\n17:17.680 --> 17:21.960\n So anyway, you know, again, what senses am I missing\n\n17:21.960 --> 17:23.400\n or what understanding am I missing\n\n17:23.400 --> 17:27.000\n that's preventing me from seeing the dots connect\n\n17:27.000 --> 17:28.640\n in the world all around me?\n\n17:28.640 --> 17:31.360\n And I think sometimes if we are oftentimes\n\n17:31.360 --> 17:33.400\n at least personally, I've screwed this up a lot.\n\n17:33.400 --> 17:36.280\n I'm so nose deep in the trench of trying to understand\n\n17:36.280 --> 17:37.880\n what I'm doing that I can't take a step back\n\n17:37.880 --> 17:40.240\n and realize, you know, that I'm in a forest,\n\n17:40.240 --> 17:42.360\n not just headbutting a tree.\n\n17:42.360 --> 17:43.960\n And I may be doing both, maybe both,\n\n17:43.960 --> 17:45.360\n two things should be true at once.\n\n17:45.360 --> 17:48.000\n But so I would say when it comes to strategy,\n\n17:48.000 --> 17:50.280\n trying to understand that, but then also you go,\n\n17:50.280 --> 17:52.760\n well, okay, well, how can, that sounds cool,\n\n17:52.760 --> 17:54.400\n but how can you actually do that?\n\n17:54.400 --> 17:56.240\n And then I'd say, that's a really good question\n\n17:56.240 --> 17:57.480\n because if I imagine I say, man,\n\n17:57.480 --> 17:58.880\n I should fight like Steven Thompson,\n\n17:58.880 --> 18:00.000\n I should fight like Wonderboy,\n\n18:00.000 --> 18:01.400\n it's like, good idea, go do that.\n\n18:01.400 --> 18:05.200\n I'm like, not the guy.\n\n18:05.200 --> 18:07.320\n I would fight like Khabib Nurmagomedov if I could.\n\n18:07.320 --> 18:08.560\n You know, it seems to work.\n\n18:08.560 --> 18:11.640\n So anyway, you go, well, what if I could develop,\n\n18:11.640 --> 18:14.000\n what if I could take my time developing skills\n\n18:14.000 --> 18:16.960\n so that when these strategies become apparent,\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:19.280\n they are executable to you.\n\n18:19.280 --> 18:21.840\n You actually have the ability to like,\n\n18:21.840 --> 18:24.000\n in or to again, to be the person in the arena,\n\n18:24.000 --> 18:25.480\n to be the person required,\n\n18:25.480 --> 18:26.840\n whereas there's plenty of great ideas\n\n18:26.840 --> 18:29.400\n like dunking a basketball is a fantastic idea.\n\n18:29.400 --> 18:31.960\n Alas, for me, unless there's a small trampoline nearby,\n\n18:31.960 --> 18:33.120\n I'm not the guy.\n\n18:33.120 --> 18:35.240\n But that doesn't make it any less good of an idea.\n\n18:35.240 --> 18:38.720\n I just haven't developed the ability or I lack the ability.\n\n18:38.720 --> 18:40.560\n So anyway, I think a lot of times,\n\n18:40.560 --> 18:42.080\n at least when I watch people in fighting,\n\n18:42.080 --> 18:43.720\n I'll use an example.\n\n18:43.720 --> 18:46.440\n We're so concerned with trying to win early on\n\n18:46.440 --> 18:48.800\n rather than develop skills that I'm going like,\n\n18:48.800 --> 18:50.320\n well, what's the best way to fight\n\n18:50.320 --> 18:51.800\n with my current set of skills?\n\n18:51.800 --> 18:54.560\n And usually the path forward is like the barbarian route,\n\n18:54.560 --> 18:57.160\n like you put on the one ring,\n\n18:57.160 --> 18:59.160\n take the damage you need to take to hit that guy.\n\n18:59.160 --> 19:00.520\n And that was something I realized very early on\n\n19:00.520 --> 19:01.440\n in my MMA career was like,\n\n19:01.440 --> 19:03.600\n I'm not that good at striking at that time,\n\n19:03.600 --> 19:05.520\n not a world class striker now,\n\n19:05.520 --> 19:07.080\n but I'm way better at striking\n\n19:07.080 --> 19:08.120\n than I'm given any credit for\n\n19:08.120 --> 19:09.880\n because it helps people sleep at night, I think.\n\n19:09.880 --> 19:11.200\n But I'm serious.\n\n19:11.200 --> 19:12.400\n But...\n\n19:12.400 --> 19:13.920\n Yeah, yeah, you're always introduced\n\n19:13.920 --> 19:17.320\n as like this master grappler.\n\n19:17.320 --> 19:18.640\n I'm like, that's nice of them to say that.\n\n19:18.640 --> 19:19.920\n Maybe I'm not that good at grappling.\n\n19:19.920 --> 19:21.240\n We haven't even seen that.\n\n19:21.240 --> 19:22.280\n But the funny thing is where I'm like,\n\n19:22.280 --> 19:23.440\n just because people almost go like,\n\n19:23.440 --> 19:25.360\n well, Lex, see, you're really good at this,\n\n19:25.360 --> 19:27.080\n but you gotta understand, we're equal, man.\n\n19:27.080 --> 19:28.200\n I'm good at this other thing.\n\n19:28.200 --> 19:29.560\n Maybe you're really good at what you do\n\n19:29.560 --> 19:31.080\n and I'm just mediocre at what I do.\n\n19:31.080 --> 19:32.360\n That's also possible.\n\n19:32.360 --> 19:33.880\n So there's plenty of people that define themselves\n\n19:33.880 --> 19:35.000\n as a striker that do that\n\n19:35.000 --> 19:36.800\n just because that's for lack of other options.\n\n19:36.800 --> 19:38.040\n It's not because they're really good striker.\n\n19:38.040 --> 19:38.880\n I'm a grappler.\n\n19:38.880 --> 19:40.600\n I was a grappler as a blue belt.\n\n19:40.600 --> 19:41.440\n Not really.\n\n19:41.440 --> 19:43.480\n So anyway, I guess to come back,\n\n19:43.480 --> 19:45.080\n if I'm constantly going,\n\n19:45.080 --> 19:47.120\n how can I win with what I've got right now?\n\n19:47.120 --> 19:48.880\n I think oftentimes I never take the time\n\n19:48.880 --> 19:50.520\n to develop the skills that I wanna develop\n\n19:50.520 --> 19:51.520\n and I also never take the time\n\n19:51.520 --> 19:53.080\n to develop the strategies that I wanna develop.\n\n19:53.080 --> 19:55.280\n And that has actually been a one big blessing\n\n19:55.280 --> 19:57.320\n of fighting someone frequently,\n\n19:57.320 --> 19:58.440\n which has been really frustrating\n\n19:58.440 --> 20:00.800\n as a result of injuries and time away\n\n20:00.800 --> 20:03.320\n and some of those people being hesitant to get in the game.\n\n20:03.320 --> 20:06.960\n But it gives you so much time to be out of the trenches\n\n20:06.960 --> 20:08.920\n and focus on developing your abilities\n\n20:08.920 --> 20:10.720\n so that now it's almost like developing money\n\n20:10.720 --> 20:11.800\n like you mentioned the stock market\n\n20:11.800 --> 20:13.320\n that you can now put in.\n\n20:13.320 --> 20:16.080\n Imagine you told me Bitcoin was a great idea five years ago\n\n20:16.080 --> 20:17.280\n and I had eight bucks.\n\n20:17.280 --> 20:18.800\n Man, if someone told me Bitcoin was a great idea\n\n20:18.800 --> 20:20.920\n five years ago and I had 50K,\n\n20:20.920 --> 20:23.440\n I'd be like, oh my God, I'd be sleeping in my bed of money\n\n20:23.440 --> 20:24.880\n that I would then set on fire later\n\n20:24.880 --> 20:26.120\n so they had just to do it.\n\n20:26.120 --> 20:27.920\n So due to all the injuries,\n\n20:27.920 --> 20:29.920\n you've been mining Bitcoin all this time\n\n20:29.920 --> 20:31.200\n and now you're a rich man.\n\n20:31.200 --> 20:32.320\n Well, no, actually someone told me\n\n20:32.320 --> 20:33.880\n I was trying to mine for Bitcoin,\n\n20:33.880 --> 20:35.560\n actually like in a cave.\n\n20:35.560 --> 20:37.480\n And then I found out recently that it's actually,\n\n20:37.480 --> 20:39.600\n mining is like a figure of speech.\n\n20:39.600 --> 20:41.200\n You misunderstood. Not like a literal thing that you do.\n\n20:41.200 --> 20:42.040\n But I mean, in my defense, I only know what I know.\n\n20:42.040 --> 20:43.800\n English language is difficult.\n\n20:43.800 --> 20:45.200\n It is, it really is.\n\n20:45.200 --> 20:47.440\n Next time talk to me, I'll explain.\n\n20:47.440 --> 20:50.440\n Russian is more, is a rich language.\n\n20:50.440 --> 20:52.640\n You should learn, you should learn Russian.\n\n20:52.640 --> 20:53.480\n I'll help you out.\n\n20:53.480 --> 20:54.560\n I believe you, thank you.\n\n20:54.560 --> 20:59.560\n Can you do a whirlwind overview of your career\n\n20:59.560 --> 21:03.120\n in MMA leading up to this point\n\n21:03.120 --> 21:06.280\n with the injuries and the undefeated record?\n\n21:06.280 --> 21:09.320\n And then what's next since we're on the topic?\n\n21:09.320 --> 21:12.600\n I did my first fight as a blue belt\n\n21:12.600 --> 21:13.960\n and I've been training for about a year and a half.\n\n21:13.960 --> 21:16.360\n I did nine Jiu Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends\n\n21:16.360 --> 21:18.200\n or maybe eight Jiu Jitsu tournaments in 10 weekends\n\n21:18.200 --> 21:22.240\n prior to my first fight in April 2006.\n\n21:22.240 --> 21:23.640\n I got punched in the face a whole bunch.\n\n21:23.640 --> 21:25.360\n I didn't realize it was a professional fight\n\n21:25.360 --> 21:27.480\n and found that out like the day beforehand.\n\n21:27.480 --> 21:28.880\n That was great.\n\n21:28.880 --> 21:29.720\n Thanks, coach.\n\n21:30.880 --> 21:32.880\n It was in Atlantic City where another place\n\n21:32.880 --> 21:34.160\n no one ever goes on purpose.\n\n21:34.160 --> 21:35.200\n So that wasn't great.\n\n21:35.200 --> 21:38.960\n I got into three, actually three car accidents\n\n21:38.960 --> 21:42.080\n in the preceding 36 hours before the fight.\n\n21:42.080 --> 21:44.120\n I had my car totaled.\n\n21:44.120 --> 21:45.560\n I wasn't driving for any of them.\n\n21:45.560 --> 21:47.080\n That was great.\n\n21:47.080 --> 21:47.920\n It was 2006?\n\n21:47.920 --> 21:49.120\n It was 2006, yeah.\n\n21:49.120 --> 21:50.240\n You were a blue belt?\n\n21:50.240 --> 21:51.960\n Yeah, yeah, I've been training for about a year and a half.\n\n21:51.960 --> 21:53.120\n So you're a blue belt.\n\n21:53.120 --> 21:55.240\n You're getting, I mean, if you haven't lived,\n\n21:55.240 --> 21:57.720\n if you haven't gotten punched in the face in Atlantic City.\n\n21:57.720 --> 21:58.560\n That's true.\n\n21:58.560 --> 22:01.760\n I mean, I would have loved to have it happen\n\n22:01.760 --> 22:03.000\n for different reasons.\n\n22:03.000 --> 22:06.160\n But yeah, well, what's funny is I remember\n\n22:06.160 --> 22:07.520\n getting punched in the face a bunch,\n\n22:07.520 --> 22:08.960\n trying to do inverted guard.\n\n22:08.960 --> 22:10.840\n I won one round, lost two rounds,\n\n22:10.840 --> 22:12.160\n definitely lost the fight.\n\n22:12.160 --> 22:13.920\n So you went for inverted, sorry to interrupt.\n\n22:13.920 --> 22:14.760\n You went for inverted guard.\n\n22:14.760 --> 22:16.600\n Can you tell the story of that fight real quick?\n\n22:16.600 --> 22:17.440\n Yeah, sure.\n\n22:17.440 --> 22:18.280\n It was three three minute rounds,\n\n22:18.280 --> 22:19.920\n which is not a professional fight length,\n\n22:19.920 --> 22:21.680\n although I don't know if professional fight length\n\n22:21.680 --> 22:22.520\n would have been any better.\n\n22:22.520 --> 22:24.320\n It's just more time to get punched.\n\n22:24.320 --> 22:26.280\n But I found out partway through,\n\n22:26.280 --> 22:27.640\n I was like, I remember walking back to my corner\n\n22:27.640 --> 22:29.200\n in the first round, I'm like, yeah, this guy can't hurt me.\n\n22:29.200 --> 22:31.840\n And he's like, yeah, my corner was my friend, Tom,\n\n22:31.840 --> 22:32.800\n and then someone else.\n\n22:32.800 --> 22:34.520\n And then he's like, yeah, I would still encourage you\n\n22:34.520 --> 22:36.360\n to stop blocking so many punches with your face.\n\n22:36.360 --> 22:37.880\n I'm like, that's a good idea, Tom, I appreciate that.\n\n22:37.880 --> 22:39.200\n I'm gonna try that.\n\n22:39.200 --> 22:43.000\n Anyway, I remember I was not allowed to up kick.\n\n22:43.000 --> 22:43.880\n So I'm like, great.\n\n22:43.880 --> 22:46.880\n I had no martial arts skills, really at all.\n\n22:46.880 --> 22:48.440\n But if I had anything at all, it was jiu jitsu.\n\n22:48.440 --> 22:50.440\n It was very, very little jiu jitsu.\n\n22:50.440 --> 22:53.120\n But definitely no wrestling, definitely no striking.\n\n22:53.120 --> 22:55.160\n I was basically a magnet for punches.\n\n22:55.160 --> 22:59.360\n So that was your time, roughnecking out in Atlantic City\n\n22:59.360 --> 23:01.360\n as we all do once in a while.\n\n23:01.360 --> 23:02.960\n Can we fast forward to when you're actually\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:04.960\n dominating the world as a black belt?\n\n23:04.960 --> 23:05.800\n Well, actually, it's funny,\n\n23:05.800 --> 23:07.200\n because I took a little bit of money that they're like,\n\n23:07.200 --> 23:08.040\n hey, we're paying you.\n\n23:08.040 --> 23:08.880\n I'm like, really?\n\n23:08.880 --> 23:11.960\n It's like Bukowski stories with Ryan Hall.\n\n23:11.960 --> 23:13.440\n Well, then I went to the casino.\n\n23:13.440 --> 23:14.880\n I went to whatever, like the Tropicana\n\n23:14.880 --> 23:16.320\n that was right there, the casino,\n\n23:16.320 --> 23:17.280\n because that was a boardwalk hall.\n\n23:17.280 --> 23:18.400\n I'm like, you know what, man?\n\n23:18.400 --> 23:20.800\n This has been a not great evening.\n\n23:20.800 --> 23:22.440\n I'm gonna win it back.\n\n23:22.440 --> 23:23.360\n This will be great.\n\n23:23.360 --> 23:25.960\n 15 minutes later, they had all the money\n\n23:25.960 --> 23:27.840\n that I had from the fight was gone.\n\n23:27.840 --> 23:30.600\n I just remember walking out of the casino super pissed.\n\n23:30.600 --> 23:32.400\n And I don't know what I was thinking.\n\n23:32.400 --> 23:33.640\n I'm not good at gambling.\n\n23:33.640 --> 23:35.400\n This was not gonna make my night better.\n\n23:35.400 --> 23:36.320\n I just thought that there was gonna be\n\n23:36.320 --> 23:37.720\n some sort of cosmic balancing,\n\n23:37.720 --> 23:39.520\n and maybe it was the cosmic balancing all at once\n\n23:39.520 --> 23:40.360\n for things I'd done in the past.\n\n23:40.360 --> 23:43.600\n Longer term, though, the balancing.\n\n23:43.600 --> 23:44.440\n We'll see.\n\n23:44.440 --> 23:45.280\n I hope so.\n\n23:45.280 --> 23:46.960\n We're all dead in the end, though.\n\n23:46.960 --> 23:47.800\n That is true.\n\n23:47.800 --> 23:49.240\n Time will get us all, yeah.\n\n23:50.320 --> 23:51.680\n Well, so that was the first one,\n\n23:51.680 --> 23:54.440\n and that was when I realized I'm terrible at MMA,\n\n23:54.440 --> 23:55.520\n but I like it.\n\n23:55.520 --> 23:57.200\n I should just stop this until I one day\n\n23:57.200 --> 23:58.560\n learn how to actually grapple,\n\n23:58.560 --> 23:59.680\n much less learn how to fight.\n\n23:59.680 --> 24:01.200\n But I remember there was this guy named Dave Kaplan,\n\n24:01.200 --> 24:03.040\n who's the reason my ears are all messed up,\n\n24:03.040 --> 24:05.440\n who was on the Ultimate Fighter and got punched in the face\n\n24:05.440 --> 24:06.640\n and knocked out by Tom Lawler,\n\n24:06.640 --> 24:09.040\n who I'll always appreciate for doing that.\n\n24:09.040 --> 24:10.640\n But anyway.\n\n24:10.640 --> 24:11.720\n Dave or Tom?\n\n24:11.720 --> 24:12.560\n I appreciate Tom.\n\n24:12.560 --> 24:13.400\n I appreciate Dave, too.\n\n24:13.400 --> 24:14.240\n Dave was great.\n\n24:14.240 --> 24:15.080\n Dave was just a huge bully,\n\n24:15.080 --> 24:17.440\n and used to, not completely unmercifully,\n\n24:17.440 --> 24:19.720\n but relatively unmercifully beat the crap out of me.\n\n24:19.720 --> 24:21.360\n And anyway.\n\n24:21.360 --> 24:22.400\n Well, the ears look good, so.\n\n24:22.400 --> 24:23.240\n I appreciate that.\n\n24:23.240 --> 24:25.160\n I tell people it's a tumor that I got,\n\n24:25.160 --> 24:27.880\n and if they want in on a class action lawsuit with AT&T,\n\n24:27.880 --> 24:31.160\n they should send me an email.\n\n24:31.160 --> 24:32.000\n But anyway.\n\n24:32.000 --> 24:33.920\n Well, you're very financially savvy.\n\n24:33.920 --> 24:34.760\n Very good.\n\n24:34.760 --> 24:36.080\n No, I just give the impression.\n\n24:36.080 --> 24:37.600\n Dave basically said, hey, don't worry, man.\n\n24:37.600 --> 24:39.600\n You're never gonna be good at MMA.\n\n24:39.600 --> 24:41.160\n And you're never gonna be good at grappling, either,\n\n24:41.160 --> 24:42.560\n but even if you are good at grappling,\n\n24:42.560 --> 24:45.440\n which, in my opinion, you will never be,\n\n24:45.440 --> 24:46.640\n you will never be good at fighting.\n\n24:46.640 --> 24:50.240\n And I said, Dave, if I do nothing else in my life,\n\n24:50.240 --> 24:52.720\n I'm gonna keep training until I can make you pay for that.\n\n24:52.720 --> 24:54.600\n And now that I can make him pay for that really easily,\n\n24:54.600 --> 24:55.600\n he doesn't train anymore.\n\n24:55.600 --> 24:56.440\n But I love Dave.\n\n24:56.440 --> 24:57.280\n Dave's awesome.\n\n24:57.280 --> 24:58.120\n He actually won the singing beat.\n\n24:58.120 --> 24:59.200\n What an interesting dude.\n\n24:59.200 --> 25:00.040\n Super interesting guy.\n\n25:00.040 --> 25:00.880\n But anyway.\n\n25:00.880 --> 25:03.760\n Virginia, like, speaks a couple languages.\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:04.600\n Super interesting guy.\n\n25:04.600 --> 25:06.800\n Like, shockingly good at Jeopardy, too.\n\n25:07.800 --> 25:09.800\n Not that I'm any good, but still shockingly good at Jeopardy.\n\n25:09.800 --> 25:11.600\n So anyway, years later, met Faraz Zahabi.\n\n25:11.600 --> 25:13.760\n Actually, John Danaher, I met John Danaher,\n\n25:13.760 --> 25:15.600\n and he put me in touch with Faraz Zahabi.\n\n25:15.600 --> 25:16.840\n I started training at TriStar.\n\n25:16.840 --> 25:18.920\n I immediately loved working with Faraz\n\n25:18.920 --> 25:19.760\n and learning under Faraz.\n\n25:19.760 --> 25:20.840\n Started training at TriStar.\n\n25:20.840 --> 25:24.000\n And I did my first real professional MMA fight\n\n25:24.000 --> 25:25.680\n as someone that actually does,\n\n25:25.680 --> 25:30.680\n had practiced a little bit prior in, I think, August, 2012.\n\n25:31.080 --> 25:34.840\n And that was against a guy, he was four and five at the time.\n\n25:34.840 --> 25:36.720\n So, you know, had some experience,\n\n25:36.720 --> 25:38.760\n good kind of like first go for me, honestly.\n\n25:38.760 --> 25:40.920\n And I won that fight by TKO.\n\n25:40.920 --> 25:42.760\n And then it was a little bit of a time off.\n\n25:42.760 --> 25:44.280\n And then I did another fight against a tough guy\n\n25:44.280 --> 25:45.880\n named Magid Hamo.\n\n25:45.880 --> 25:47.040\n He was five and two at the time.\n\n25:47.040 --> 25:48.040\n I think he was three and I was amateur.\n\n25:48.040 --> 25:50.280\n So, you know, a good little bit of fighting experience.\n\n25:50.280 --> 25:53.140\n Won that one in the first round of Iron Rear Naked Choke.\n\n25:53.140 --> 25:56.380\n And then started to experience difficulty\n\n25:56.380 --> 25:59.080\n getting fights at that point.\n\n25:59.080 --> 25:59.920\n You know, I...\n\n25:59.920 --> 26:00.760\n Were you continuously introduced\n\n26:00.760 --> 26:04.560\n as like the master of grappling, the submission?\n\n26:04.560 --> 26:05.880\n At least that was my thing.\n\n26:05.880 --> 26:06.720\n I don't know if I was...\n\n26:06.720 --> 26:08.800\n Is that was the source of the fear for people?\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:10.000\n I think so, because, I mean,\n\n26:10.000 --> 26:12.400\n I definitely wasn't much at striking at that point.\n\n26:12.400 --> 26:14.600\n You know, I definitely am a lot,\n\n26:14.600 --> 26:15.920\n I like to think I'm pretty hard to hurt,\n\n26:15.920 --> 26:17.160\n although I try not to lean on that.\n\n26:17.160 --> 26:19.240\n And I played baseball for like 16 years,\n\n26:19.240 --> 26:20.240\n so I can hit things pretty hard.\n\n26:20.240 --> 26:23.640\n I just wasn't able to, I recognized pretty early on\n\n26:23.640 --> 26:26.080\n that I had no idea how to actually hit things hard\n\n26:26.080 --> 26:28.280\n without becoming hitable myself.\n\n26:28.280 --> 26:31.120\n So I think that's kind of the big thing is a lot of times,\n\n26:31.120 --> 26:33.360\n like we almost were mentioning before,\n\n26:33.360 --> 26:36.640\n if you try to go and get people too early,\n\n26:36.640 --> 26:38.700\n you can hit them if they're not that good,\n\n26:38.700 --> 26:40.240\n but you're going to get hit yourself.\n\n26:40.240 --> 26:42.320\n So you're making, you're basically making a wager.\n\n26:42.320 --> 26:44.200\n You're making a trade of your own life\n\n26:44.200 --> 26:45.440\n for the ability to hit them.\n\n26:45.440 --> 26:47.240\n When you watch guys like Israel Adesanya,\n\n26:47.240 --> 26:49.560\n Floyd Mayweather, Steven Thompson,\n\n26:49.560 --> 26:51.780\n Conor McGregor, when he's fighting really well,\n\n26:51.780 --> 26:53.000\n it's not a trade.\n\n26:53.000 --> 26:55.440\n They're not, you're hitting them and they're hitting you.\n\n26:55.440 --> 26:56.840\n It's, they're hitting you,\n\n26:56.840 --> 26:59.280\n but it takes years and years and years and years\n\n26:59.280 --> 27:00.200\n to be able to learn how to do that.\n\n27:00.200 --> 27:01.800\n Ton Lee is another great example of that.\n\n27:01.800 --> 27:02.960\n You know, my closest training partner,\n\n27:02.960 --> 27:04.120\n one of my best friends,\n\n27:04.120 --> 27:06.960\n and currently now one champion,\n\n27:06.960 --> 27:08.560\n one championship in Asia,\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:10.080\n the champion of the featherweight,\n\n27:10.080 --> 27:14.120\n or I guess lightweight featherweight, 155 over there now.\n\n27:14.120 --> 27:16.080\n And he recently defeated Martin Wynn\n\n27:16.080 --> 27:17.240\n in a really great fight.\n\n27:17.240 --> 27:19.520\n And Ton knocked him out, long time champion.\n\n27:19.520 --> 27:21.120\n And Ton doesn't let you hit him.\n\n27:21.120 --> 27:22.260\n He doesn't let you touch him.\n\n27:22.260 --> 27:25.160\n I feel so fortunate to have met guys like Steven and Ton\n\n27:25.160 --> 27:28.900\n to go early on in career and go, holy moly,\n\n27:28.900 --> 27:30.540\n I can't even, it's not even like,\n\n27:30.540 --> 27:32.240\n oh, you'll let me walk over and find you.\n\n27:32.240 --> 27:34.160\n It's like fighting a ghost that periodically shows up\n\n27:34.160 --> 27:36.160\n with a hammer and smokes you in the melon\n\n27:36.160 --> 27:38.000\n and then disappears into the ether again.\n\n27:38.000 --> 27:40.120\n So the way they approach the fighting game is thinking,\n\n27:40.120 --> 27:42.040\n how can I attack without being hit?\n\n27:42.040 --> 27:45.240\n So every strategy, every idea you have\n\n27:45.240 --> 27:46.640\n about what you're going to do\n\n27:46.640 --> 27:51.640\n has to do with like that minimizing the returns.\n\n27:52.440 --> 27:53.280\n Absolutely.\n\n27:53.280 --> 27:54.600\n I mean, that's what all good fighting is done.\n\n27:54.600 --> 27:55.940\n All poor fighting, you know,\n\n27:55.940 --> 27:57.440\n throughout the course of history, most generals,\n\n27:57.440 --> 27:58.440\n whether they're, so I read,\n\n27:58.440 --> 28:01.520\n or, you know, they did battles by attrition.\n\n28:01.520 --> 28:03.920\n You know, it's like, yeah, man, I've got 150 guys.\n\n28:03.920 --> 28:04.760\n You've got 50.\n\n28:04.760 --> 28:06.760\n You're like, yeah, if 60 of my guys die killing your 50,\n\n28:06.760 --> 28:08.080\n like, that's great for me.\n\n28:08.080 --> 28:10.720\n But that's not so great for the 60 guys that died.\n\n28:10.720 --> 28:11.980\n You know, I hope it's worth it.\n\n28:11.980 --> 28:13.440\n So when you realize that not only,\n\n28:13.440 --> 28:16.360\n you're not just Kobe Bryant and you're Phil Jackson too,\n\n28:16.360 --> 28:17.920\n you got to do everything.\n\n28:17.920 --> 28:21.000\n You know, if you've got to run across the beach in Normandy,\n\n28:21.000 --> 28:21.840\n so be it.\n\n28:21.840 --> 28:23.440\n But that better be, you should have,\n\n28:23.440 --> 28:24.820\n we make sure we thought this through and there's like,\n\n28:24.820 --> 28:26.320\n hey, there's no way we can like, you know,\n\n28:26.320 --> 28:27.920\n walk around the side, huh?\n\n28:27.920 --> 28:30.000\n Because oftentimes there is,\n\n28:30.000 --> 28:32.200\n and I think a lot of times there's a lot of incentives\n\n28:32.200 --> 28:33.800\n in professional fighting too,\n\n28:33.800 --> 28:34.820\n for people to want to do that.\n\n28:34.820 --> 28:36.220\n And we come up with all sorts of,\n\n28:36.220 --> 28:38.420\n well, I'm trying to be exciting.\n\n28:38.420 --> 28:39.260\n Are you?\n\n28:39.260 --> 28:40.280\n Is that really what you came here to do?\n\n28:40.280 --> 28:41.440\n Cause I came here to win.\n\n28:41.440 --> 28:44.120\n And I think that anyone that's really successful\n\n28:44.120 --> 28:44.960\n came there to win.\n\n28:44.960 --> 28:46.600\n And if it ends up being exciting, well, that's fantastic.\n\n28:46.600 --> 28:48.800\n I hope that people enjoy watching something and that's great,\n\n28:48.800 --> 28:51.320\n but that's a qualitative assessment anyway.\n\n28:51.320 --> 28:54.120\n You know, you want to also be able to, you know,\n\n28:54.120 --> 28:55.420\n live the rest of your life.\n\n28:55.420 --> 28:57.620\n I think it's easy, you know, I'll use Meldrick Taylor.\n\n28:57.620 --> 28:58.580\n I'm a big boxing fan.\n\n28:58.580 --> 29:00.880\n Meldrick Taylor was an excellent fighter,\n\n29:00.880 --> 29:05.120\n came this close to a world title and was stopped with like,\n\n29:05.120 --> 29:07.520\n he was in a fight that he was winning with seconds remaining,\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:08.720\n literally seconds remaining.\n\n29:08.720 --> 29:10.240\n And they probably could have just let it go\n\n29:10.240 --> 29:11.400\n and he would have been world champion.\n\n29:11.400 --> 29:12.240\n And it was brutal.\n\n29:12.240 --> 29:15.200\n If you ever watched legendary nights like a HBO boxing show,\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:17.980\n it's great, but it's heartbreaking.\n\n29:17.980 --> 29:18.860\n It's absolutely heartbreaking.\n\n29:18.860 --> 29:21.240\n And also like the beating that he absorbed in that fight\n\n29:21.240 --> 29:22.940\n changed him for the rest of his life.\n\n29:22.940 --> 29:25.540\n And also, you know, don't think he'd never been hit before,\n\n29:25.540 --> 29:26.800\n but it was one of those where you go,\n\n29:26.800 --> 29:30.000\n it's all fun and games until you can't remember your name\n\n29:30.000 --> 29:31.800\n at age 44 years old.\n\n29:31.800 --> 29:35.080\n And I didn't come here, what did Patton saying?\n\n29:35.080 --> 29:37.200\n Nobody wins a war by dying for his country.\n\n29:37.200 --> 29:39.260\n You make the other poor bastard die for his.\n\n29:39.260 --> 29:42.500\n And I think that that's kind of what we're shooting for.\n\n29:42.500 --> 29:46.820\n And, you know, the lionization of absorbing damage\n\n29:46.820 --> 29:48.280\n and that not being a big deal,\n\n29:48.280 --> 29:49.180\n like you hear that all the time.\n\n29:49.180 --> 29:50.640\n So and so can take shots\n\n29:50.640 --> 29:52.520\n that would put a lesser fighter down.\n\n29:53.600 --> 29:54.720\n What does that even mean?\n\n29:54.720 --> 29:56.200\n You know, like, so let me get this straight.\n\n29:56.200 --> 29:59.040\n Your ability to absorb damage is a part of you.\n\n29:59.040 --> 30:00.240\n I mean, I guess that, don't get me wrong,\n\n30:00.240 --> 30:03.120\n that is an attribute that's nice to have if you need it.\n\n30:03.120 --> 30:04.080\n But there's plenty of people\n\n30:04.080 --> 30:06.260\n that actually have really porous defense\n\n30:06.260 --> 30:08.880\n that are just very, very difficult to hurt\n\n30:08.880 --> 30:10.160\n for whatever reason.\n\n30:10.160 --> 30:12.440\n That's a fascinating fighter's perspective on the thing.\n\n30:12.440 --> 30:17.440\n I mean, the story that is inspiring\n\n30:18.320 --> 30:22.360\n and I know it goes against the artistry of fighting\n\n30:22.360 --> 30:27.240\n is when you have taken the damage to still rise up\n\n30:27.240 --> 30:29.160\n and be able to defeat the opponent.\n\n30:29.160 --> 30:34.160\n So it's, but that's a flip side of a basically\n\n30:35.060 --> 30:38.600\n you failing to defend yourself properly, right?\n\n30:38.600 --> 30:39.440\n I agree.\n\n30:39.440 --> 30:40.920\n But let's say for, I think it's a triumph,\n\n30:40.920 --> 30:42.560\n that's a triumph of humanity.\n\n30:42.560 --> 30:44.080\n That's a triumph, that's amazing.\n\n30:44.080 --> 30:46.440\n To witness such a thing is unbelievable.\n\n30:46.440 --> 30:50.240\n But you still go, this is, there is a cost here.\n\n30:50.240 --> 30:52.200\n It's like, I've been fortunate enough\n\n30:52.200 --> 30:54.280\n to spend some time working with the military\n\n30:54.280 --> 30:56.120\n and I've been like around and read\n\n30:56.120 --> 30:57.920\n Medal of Honor citations, they're unbelievable.\n\n30:57.920 --> 31:00.920\n Like you read the story and you're like, it'll floor you.\n\n31:00.920 --> 31:01.840\n But it's still a cost\n\n31:01.840 --> 31:03.800\n and you don't wanna be paying that cost a long time.\n\n31:03.800 --> 31:06.300\n And most of the time the cost was everything.\n\n31:06.300 --> 31:07.880\n And then sometimes you go, hey, yeah,\n\n31:07.880 --> 31:10.320\n the value here, it's worth everything.\n\n31:10.320 --> 31:12.040\n It's like, I defend your family,\n\n31:12.040 --> 31:14.160\n defend your country under certain circumstances.\n\n31:14.160 --> 31:16.080\n And if that point is extension of your family,\n\n31:16.080 --> 31:17.480\n you're like, hey, this is worth it.\n\n31:17.480 --> 31:20.160\n To casually throw your life away or throw your health away,\n\n31:20.160 --> 31:21.000\n it's foolish.\n\n31:21.000 --> 31:22.720\n There's nothing great about that.\n\n31:22.720 --> 31:26.400\n And like you said, it's still an amazing thing to see, but.\n\n31:26.400 --> 31:29.480\n But it's also amazing to see you not take damage\n\n31:29.480 --> 31:30.440\n as the Floyd Mayweather,\n\n31:30.440 --> 31:32.360\n it's the artistry of like not being hit.\n\n31:32.360 --> 31:33.600\n And I wonder if maybe that's why people\n\n31:33.600 --> 31:35.080\n don't resonate with Floyd as much,\n\n31:35.080 --> 31:37.280\n is obviously Muhammad Ali was such a time and place,\n\n31:37.280 --> 31:38.880\n a great man for so many different reasons.\n\n31:38.880 --> 31:40.200\n Although it was funny to remember\n\n31:40.200 --> 31:42.080\n like there were times when he wasn't very popular.\n\n31:42.080 --> 31:44.280\n We love him now because of time of context,\n\n31:44.280 --> 31:46.340\n time to move away from some of the nonsense\n\n31:46.340 --> 31:47.340\n he had to deal with.\n\n31:47.340 --> 31:49.980\n But we got to see him struggle.\n\n31:49.980 --> 31:52.000\n And also he had unbelievable sacrifice,\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:54.040\n both in and out of the ring,\n\n31:54.040 --> 31:55.880\n that we all got to witness.\n\n31:55.880 --> 31:58.040\n We've never really seen Floyd struggle like that.\n\n31:58.040 --> 32:00.000\n And granted, obviously Floyd isn't like a civil rights\n\n32:00.000 --> 32:01.660\n figure like Muhammad Ali was,\n\n32:01.660 --> 32:02.820\n it's different time, different place,\n\n32:02.820 --> 32:03.660\n and he's a different man.\n\n32:03.660 --> 32:06.780\n But basically, I wonder if part of the thing\n\n32:06.780 --> 32:09.720\n that made everyone think of Muhammad Ali as the greatest,\n\n32:09.720 --> 32:11.520\n in addition to, of course, the unbelievable things\n\n32:11.520 --> 32:15.080\n that he did out in the world and the stands that he made,\n\n32:15.080 --> 32:17.240\n we saw him struggle in the ring.\n\n32:17.240 --> 32:19.080\n It's almost, it's humanizing.\n\n32:19.080 --> 32:22.600\n You know, it's weird when people respect Khabib,\n\n32:22.600 --> 32:26.720\n but again, we saw GSP lose and GSP came back stronger.\n\n32:26.720 --> 32:28.360\n Khabib is amazing.\n\n32:28.360 --> 32:31.080\n But I wonder how people feel about him longterm.\n\n32:31.080 --> 32:33.360\n Not like they won't think of him as amazing and great.\n\n32:33.360 --> 32:35.840\n And he's been a respectable person and champion.\n\n32:35.840 --> 32:40.840\n But the time, he hasn't had to fall, if that makes sense.\n\n32:41.280 --> 32:46.280\n And also coupled with Ali had a way of being poetic\n\n32:47.240 --> 32:49.980\n about sort of the way he was in the ring,\n\n32:49.980 --> 32:52.080\n sort of being able to explain the artistry that he,\n\n32:52.080 --> 32:54.140\n I mean, there's like joking as being playful,\n\n32:54.140 --> 32:58.400\n but really he was able to describe the flow,\n\n32:58.400 --> 32:59.720\n like a butterfly sting like a bee.\n\n32:59.720 --> 33:03.120\n Like he was able to actually talk about his strategy\n\n33:03.120 --> 33:06.480\n without talking, without crossing that line\n\n33:06.480 --> 33:07.560\n into the Floyd Mayweather,\n\n33:07.560 --> 33:11.240\n when you're just talking about money and just talking shit.\n\n33:11.240 --> 33:12.080\n That's true.\n\n33:12.080 --> 33:14.680\n Actually Conor McGregor, when he's not talking shit,\n\n33:14.680 --> 33:16.840\n it's pretty good at like talking about the art\n\n33:16.840 --> 33:19.480\n of the martial, like the first mug guy.\n\n33:19.480 --> 33:22.360\n And I wish Khabib did the same.\n\n33:22.360 --> 33:27.360\n Actually from like the Setia brothers,\n\n33:27.640 --> 33:30.180\n there's a few, there's a culture of like being poetic\n\n33:30.180 --> 33:35.180\n about like being scholars and also bards or whatever,\n\n33:36.080 --> 33:37.840\n the poets of the game.\n\n33:37.840 --> 33:41.480\n And Khabib was more like just simple\n\n33:41.480 --> 33:44.640\n and he lets his actions speak, which is great too.\n\n33:44.640 --> 33:45.760\n It's a cool thing in its own way.\n\n33:45.760 --> 33:46.640\n Yeah, it's great.\n\n33:46.640 --> 33:48.880\n But it's nice when you can tell stories\n\n33:48.880 --> 33:53.280\n and that's probably why Ali was the great.\n\n33:53.280 --> 33:56.840\n Catch me up to, you went to three fights,\n\n33:56.840 --> 34:00.640\n I think undefeated, BJ Penn,\n\n34:00.640 --> 34:02.640\n we talked about last time you defeated BJ Penn.\n\n34:02.640 --> 34:06.960\n That's an incredible accomplishment,\n\n34:06.960 --> 34:09.080\n but you fought a lot of really tough guys.\n\n34:10.820 --> 34:12.280\n When was your last fight?\n\n34:12.280 --> 34:14.900\n And then catch me up with the injuries.\n\n34:14.900 --> 34:17.120\n A lot of people kept more and more and more\n\n34:17.120 --> 34:20.320\n were unwilling to fight you.\n\n34:20.320 --> 34:22.860\n Yeah, that's been, that was why I was out for two years\n\n34:22.860 --> 34:26.920\n following the Gray Maynard fight between the fighting Gray\n\n34:26.920 --> 34:28.400\n and BJ and the Gray Maynard fight\n\n34:28.400 --> 34:29.400\n was actually one I'm really proud of\n\n34:29.400 --> 34:31.400\n because Gray was very tough.\n\n34:31.400 --> 34:33.720\n He's very big, very strong, very experienced.\n\n34:33.720 --> 34:35.720\n I had only five fights at the time\n\n34:36.920 --> 34:38.060\n and I didn't have a lot of skills.\n\n34:38.060 --> 34:40.560\n I don't get to fight Gray with what I have today.\n\n34:40.560 --> 34:43.720\n I had to fight Gray with what I had in December, 2016.\n\n34:43.720 --> 34:46.080\n And that, it really took a lot of discipline,\n\n34:46.080 --> 34:48.320\n a lot of focus, a lot of challenge,\n\n34:48.320 --> 34:50.400\n to stay the course, to do what I needed to do in that fight\n\n34:50.400 --> 34:52.760\n and to win in ultimately dominating fashion,\n\n34:52.760 --> 34:54.960\n just not in the dominating, obvious sense\n\n34:54.960 --> 34:56.600\n that you see when someone runs across\n\n34:56.600 --> 34:58.560\n and just does that to somebody,\n\n34:58.560 --> 35:01.040\n but that wasn't on the list for me at that time.\n\n35:01.040 --> 35:03.640\n So that was an interesting one,\n\n35:03.640 --> 35:05.680\n but the time away again was very frustrating.\n\n35:05.680 --> 35:07.280\n That was incredibly difficult.\n\n35:07.280 --> 35:08.220\n Before that fight?\n\n35:08.220 --> 35:09.360\n After that fight, well,\n\n35:09.360 --> 35:12.040\n because I beat Artem Lobov\n\n35:12.040 --> 35:13.400\n in the final of the Ultimate Fighter\n\n35:13.400 --> 35:15.320\n and Artem is another guy that's tough,\n\n35:15.320 --> 35:19.760\n a lot of experience and he's a funny guy\n\n35:19.760 --> 35:20.940\n and he said some things on the internet,\n\n35:20.940 --> 35:22.680\n so he gets a lot of heat for that.\n\n35:22.680 --> 35:24.860\n But he just knocked out three of my teammates.\n\n35:24.860 --> 35:27.020\n I'm like, he put a couple of people\n\n35:27.020 --> 35:28.460\n in a pretty rough shape at the end of that.\n\n35:28.460 --> 35:29.960\n So he was doing well and that was a tough fight.\n\n35:29.960 --> 35:32.560\n Again, if I got to go back and fight that fight now,\n\n35:32.560 --> 35:34.280\n it would be not competitive at all.\n\n35:34.280 --> 35:35.680\n I mean, it wasn't competitive at that time,\n\n35:35.680 --> 35:36.920\n but it was a compelling phase.\n\n35:36.920 --> 35:38.880\n It wasn't close, but it was competitive.\n\n35:38.880 --> 35:40.520\n So you were improving and growing fast.\n\n35:40.520 --> 35:42.360\n Yeah, and it was nice to have time away.\n\n35:42.360 --> 35:43.800\n I wish I'd had more time in the ring,\n\n35:43.800 --> 35:45.600\n but again, I'd only been doing MMA\n\n35:45.600 --> 35:46.840\n for three years at that time.\n\n35:46.840 --> 35:49.400\n So the improvement from doing what,\n\n35:49.400 --> 35:54.400\n the Bitcoin mining was overriding the ring rust.\n\n35:55.120 --> 35:55.960\n I think so.\n\n35:55.960 --> 35:57.720\n I don't really believe in ring rust, if I'm honest.\n\n35:57.720 --> 36:01.240\n I can understand why people could feel a certain way,\n\n36:01.240 --> 36:02.360\n but if anything, it's almost like\n\n36:02.360 --> 36:04.520\n you just kind of forget what competition's like\n\n36:04.520 --> 36:07.120\n and you realize like, oh, you feel butterflies\n\n36:07.120 --> 36:07.940\n or something like that and you go,\n\n36:07.940 --> 36:08.920\n oh my God, this is different versus no,\n\n36:08.920 --> 36:10.280\n that's just your body getting ready to perform.\n\n36:10.280 --> 36:11.600\n It's okay, it's normal.\n\n36:11.600 --> 36:13.400\n How do you not have ring rust?\n\n36:13.400 --> 36:17.360\n I think I try to practice performing no matter what,\n\n36:17.360 --> 36:19.020\n whether it's singing karaoke and I'm very good,\n\n36:19.020 --> 36:21.800\n but like anything, you name it, talking in front of people.\n\n36:21.800 --> 36:23.840\n You embrace the butterflies.\n\n36:23.840 --> 36:26.400\n Yeah, it's almost like, I remember my last fight,\n\n36:26.400 --> 36:29.240\n I'm just staring at the wall and I'm like, huh,\n\n36:29.240 --> 36:31.600\n I guess I'm gonna fight in a couple of minutes.\n\n36:33.520 --> 36:34.640\n I mean, of course we all heard the phrase,\n\n36:34.640 --> 36:36.440\n like you can never walk in the same river twice\n\n36:36.440 --> 36:38.900\n because even if the river's the same,\n\n36:38.900 --> 36:39.940\n you're a different man.\n\n36:39.940 --> 36:42.120\n That's, I think it's a really important thing to understand\n\n36:42.120 --> 36:44.360\n because at various points in my martial arts career,\n\n36:44.360 --> 36:47.080\n I've thought, oh man, how should I feel?\n\n36:47.080 --> 36:49.160\n I remember when I used to do well in competition,\n\n36:49.160 --> 36:50.920\n I would feel, I would think these thoughts,\n\n36:50.920 --> 36:53.200\n listen to this song, think about this.\n\n36:53.200 --> 36:54.120\n I would feel a certain way.\n\n36:54.120 --> 36:55.560\n And then if you don't feel that way,\n\n36:55.560 --> 36:57.640\n I would start to become stressed\n\n36:57.640 --> 37:00.480\n because I was self inflicted versus going,\n\n37:00.480 --> 37:01.640\n you'll feel how you feel.\n\n37:01.640 --> 37:04.520\n Your job is to show up with what you have on the day,\n\n37:04.520 --> 37:05.520\n do your absolute best.\n\n37:05.520 --> 37:06.480\n It's like, I will never quit.\n\n37:06.480 --> 37:07.320\n I can be sure of that.\n\n37:07.320 --> 37:08.320\n I didn't say I can't be beat.\n\n37:08.320 --> 37:09.680\n I can definitely be beat.\n\n37:09.680 --> 37:11.640\n I could have lost every single fight that I've ever had,\n\n37:11.640 --> 37:14.640\n but I control my effort and I control my attitude.\n\n37:14.640 --> 37:17.240\n And that's, I will do my very best,\n\n37:17.240 --> 37:19.240\n execute my game plan and the event's not working.\n\n37:19.240 --> 37:21.320\n If I have to, I'll put my hands up and walk dead forward.\n\n37:21.320 --> 37:22.880\n If I need to, it's somebody,\n\n37:22.880 --> 37:24.240\n we hope that that's not where it goes,\n\n37:24.240 --> 37:27.120\n but like again, that humanizing moment\n\n37:27.120 --> 37:28.880\n where you're shooting for like just the inner,\n\n37:28.880 --> 37:31.280\n like the inner, you sacrifice the outer\n\n37:31.280 --> 37:33.000\n and all you have left is will,\n\n37:33.000 --> 37:34.800\n and you hope it doesn't happen.\n\n37:34.800 --> 37:36.080\n But if it does, you'll be there.\n\n37:36.080 --> 37:37.000\n But I guess to come back,\n\n37:37.000 --> 37:40.280\n like the extra periods of time in between fights,\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:43.840\n I think was valuable because it was deeply challenging.\n\n37:43.840 --> 37:46.640\n It was incredibly, it was heartbreaking sometimes\n\n37:46.640 --> 37:47.480\n if I'm honest, man.\n\n37:47.480 --> 37:48.480\n It's like, I didn't want to.\n\n37:48.480 --> 37:49.400\n It's just waiting.\n\n37:49.400 --> 37:50.960\n Oh my God, dude.\n\n37:50.960 --> 37:52.080\n Is there politics involved?\n\n37:52.080 --> 37:52.920\n There's a.\n\n37:52.920 --> 37:54.320\n Sometimes, you know, like I,\n\n37:56.520 --> 37:59.040\n you know, it's every single time you step into the ring,\n\n37:59.040 --> 38:00.080\n nothing's guaranteed.\n\n38:01.320 --> 38:03.080\n It's, you could be hurt.\n\n38:03.080 --> 38:04.000\n You could hurt somebody.\n\n38:04.000 --> 38:04.960\n You could win.\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:07.600\n You could lose, you know, throwing away,\n\n38:07.600 --> 38:10.040\n just like I said, throwing away your healthier life cheaply\n\n38:10.040 --> 38:12.240\n makes no sense for anyone.\n\n38:12.240 --> 38:16.280\n And, you know, having demonstrating some degree of temperance\n\n38:16.280 --> 38:17.720\n is not cowardly either.\n\n38:17.720 --> 38:20.760\n I mean, but again, if you wait too long, you have nothing.\n\n38:20.760 --> 38:25.160\n So I guess like I was trying and always being,\n\n38:25.160 --> 38:27.800\n I'm always open to fighting the absolute best people possible.\n\n38:27.800 --> 38:30.400\n I'm never turning down fights ever.\n\n38:30.400 --> 38:32.200\n You know, if some random jabroni decides\n\n38:32.200 --> 38:33.720\n that he wants to fight, I'm like, go away.\n\n38:33.720 --> 38:35.000\n If I wanted to just fight randoms,\n\n38:35.000 --> 38:37.600\n I would just start standing on the table at Denny's\n\n38:37.600 --> 38:38.440\n and start yelling.\n\n38:38.440 --> 38:39.440\n And I'm sure it would have, you know,\n\n38:39.440 --> 38:41.160\n some people would be willing to indulge me.\n\n38:41.160 --> 38:44.640\n But, you know, you want to fight, you know,\n\n38:44.640 --> 38:46.440\n meaningful opponents, challenging opponents,\n\n38:46.440 --> 38:48.160\n and I know who and where they are.\n\n38:48.160 --> 38:49.000\n And sometimes they're so well.\n\n38:49.000 --> 38:50.360\n You did fight in Atlantic City.\n\n38:50.360 --> 38:51.200\n I did.\n\n38:51.200 --> 38:52.920\n So the Denny's, but you put the Denny's behind you.\n\n38:52.920 --> 38:53.760\n I did.\n\n38:53.760 --> 38:55.160\n And, you know, I'll be honest,\n\n38:55.160 --> 38:56.960\n if I'd have stood up after that fight,\n\n38:56.960 --> 38:58.400\n I don't know if I was in great shape\n\n38:58.400 --> 39:00.120\n to expect to win in the other fights that evening,\n\n39:00.120 --> 39:01.320\n but I could have tried it.\n\n39:01.320 --> 39:02.800\n I'm sure there were some takers in the crowd,\n\n39:02.800 --> 39:04.040\n particularly after they watched me fight,\n\n39:04.040 --> 39:05.240\n they're like, yeah, I'll fight that guy.\n\n39:05.240 --> 39:07.560\n So, okay, so when was the last fight that you had?\n\n39:07.560 --> 39:08.720\n That was Darren Elkins.\n\n39:08.720 --> 39:11.240\n That was six months or seven months after the BJ fight,\n\n39:11.240 --> 39:12.240\n which is great because it's, you know,\n\n39:12.240 --> 39:14.760\n I love maybe five really tough, very tough opponent,\n\n39:14.760 --> 39:16.520\n very tough guy, super tough dude.\n\n39:16.520 --> 39:19.480\n And that was in July, 2019.\n\n39:19.480 --> 39:22.360\n And then right when I was about to fight.\n\n39:22.360 --> 39:24.440\n So you were ready to fight regularly after that.\n\n39:24.440 --> 39:25.280\n Yeah.\n\n39:25.280 --> 39:26.760\n You were trying to find a fight.\n\n39:26.760 --> 39:27.600\n Yeah.\n\n39:27.600 --> 39:29.600\n And we got Ricardo Llamas, so no one else, none of the,\n\n39:29.600 --> 39:31.600\n I was ranked in the top 15 at that point.\n\n39:31.600 --> 39:34.240\n And then people didn't want to fight.\n\n39:34.240 --> 39:35.840\n We were struggling to find an opponent.\n\n39:35.840 --> 39:37.520\n Then Ricardo Llamas, a great, you know,\n\n39:37.520 --> 39:39.880\n former title challenger, you know, MMA, you know,\n\n39:39.880 --> 39:41.880\n really great history in MMA, recently retired,\n\n39:41.880 --> 39:44.240\n but we were supposed to fight in,\n\n39:44.240 --> 39:47.680\n I think May, March, March, May of 2020.\n\n39:47.680 --> 39:49.120\n And then coronavirus happened.\n\n39:49.120 --> 39:52.080\n And so that scrapped the whole show, you know, training.\n\n39:52.080 --> 39:55.040\n We were just scrambling to try to keep the gym alive\n\n39:55.040 --> 39:57.760\n and take care, you know, I have five or six full, five, six,\n\n39:57.760 --> 40:00.080\n I think five full time employees that I, you know,\n\n40:00.080 --> 40:01.200\n they're my responsibility.\n\n40:01.200 --> 40:04.480\n I have to, their livelihood is in my hands and it's,\n\n40:04.480 --> 40:07.520\n they'd be irresponsible of me to not take that seriously.\n\n40:07.520 --> 40:10.480\n So anyway, we were able to navigate through that time.\n\n40:10.480 --> 40:13.520\n And then we were able to reschedule the Llamas fight.\n\n40:13.520 --> 40:15.800\n And that was in August of last year.\n\n40:15.800 --> 40:20.000\n And I got a, a medical like flag, like, oh, hey, you like,\n\n40:20.000 --> 40:22.240\n you, you, you have like a medical condition that we need\n\n40:22.240 --> 40:25.120\n to look into when I got pulled from the fight.\n\n40:25.120 --> 40:27.480\n And I immediately was concerned because of course,\n\n40:27.480 --> 40:30.040\n any serious medical condition you want to go, oh man,\n\n40:30.040 --> 40:31.920\n well, I guess I would like to look at that.\n\n40:31.920 --> 40:34.080\n Yeah, it turns out it was a giant false positive.\n\n40:34.080 --> 40:36.240\n And, you know, we find that out, you know,\n\n40:36.240 --> 40:39.440\n all of five weeks later and you go, you gotta be kidding me.\n\n40:39.440 --> 40:40.280\n That's frustrating.\n\n40:40.280 --> 40:42.080\n And then we're still waiting for a fight,\n\n40:42.080 --> 40:43.440\n waiting for a fight, waiting for a fight,\n\n40:43.440 --> 40:44.280\n waiting for a fight.\n\n40:44.280 --> 40:46.080\n People won't sign up.\n\n40:46.080 --> 40:48.480\n Asked for a number of different opponents, basically said,\n\n40:48.480 --> 40:50.280\n Hey, I'm willing to fight anybody that's,\n\n40:50.280 --> 40:51.880\n that's tough and moving forward.\n\n40:53.200 --> 40:56.440\n Finally got a, you know, a great opponent in Denny Gay\n\n40:57.560 --> 41:01.760\n for, I guess it would have been this, this March.\n\n41:01.760 --> 41:04.120\n And then I was training in January,\n\n41:04.120 --> 41:05.480\n working on working on some stuff.\n\n41:05.480 --> 41:08.280\n I was out training with Raymond Daniels in,\n\n41:08.280 --> 41:11.280\n in California, Raymond's amazing, unbelievable,\n\n41:11.280 --> 41:13.440\n you know, kickboxing, karate style kickboxer,\n\n41:13.440 --> 41:15.440\n fantastic martial artist, great teacher,\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:16.800\n great training partner and good friend.\n\n41:16.800 --> 41:19.480\n And, you know, just really bad luck, you know,\n\n41:19.480 --> 41:21.800\n kind of a fall in the middle of, in the middle of training.\n\n41:21.800 --> 41:25.080\n And I tore my hip flexor halfway off of my femur.\n\n41:25.080 --> 41:27.400\n So that wasn't great.\n\n41:27.400 --> 41:29.320\n And you go like, man, right at the time where you're like,\n\n41:29.320 --> 41:31.520\n oh man, all right, finally moving forward, you know,\n\n41:31.520 --> 41:32.680\n having the opportunity to fight.\n\n41:32.680 --> 41:33.920\n Dan's a really tough guy.\n\n41:33.920 --> 41:35.000\n You know, you have to fight well\n\n41:35.000 --> 41:36.600\n if you want to have a good chance to do well with him.\n\n41:36.600 --> 41:38.240\n If you don't fight well, it's going to be a rough night.\n\n41:38.240 --> 41:39.560\n And I'm like, that's exactly what I signed up for.\n\n41:39.560 --> 41:40.400\n That's what we want with BJ,\n\n41:40.400 --> 41:43.360\n that's what we want with Elkins, that was gray.\n\n41:43.360 --> 41:45.120\n And then the universe goes, hey man, I hear you,\n\n41:45.120 --> 41:46.240\n but there's also this.\n\n41:46.240 --> 41:48.800\n So anyway, unfortunately it's healing up\n\n41:48.800 --> 41:50.440\n and then hopefully I'm trying to,\n\n41:50.440 --> 41:52.760\n looking for May, I think.\n\n41:52.760 --> 41:54.080\n May this year?\n\n41:54.080 --> 41:55.440\n May of this year.\n\n41:55.440 --> 41:56.280\n Yeah.\n\n41:56.280 --> 41:57.120\n So it's been, it's been,\n\n41:57.120 --> 41:58.640\n it's been about five weeks since the injury.\n\n41:58.640 --> 42:00.120\n You'll be able to heal up, you think?\n\n42:00.120 --> 42:01.760\n Yeah, I think it'll be okay by then.\n\n42:01.760 --> 42:03.200\n Like I don't need a big camp at this point.\n\n42:03.200 --> 42:05.040\n I've had years of camp.\n\n42:06.000 --> 42:08.000\n Not going to curtail my drinking or anything like that.\n\n42:08.000 --> 42:09.480\n Obviously, you know, come on, man.\n\n42:09.480 --> 42:10.480\n Life is meant to be lived.\n\n42:10.480 --> 42:14.560\n And you know, so it's, you know, I'm in good shape.\n\n42:14.560 --> 42:15.720\n I always, I'm always training.\n\n42:15.720 --> 42:17.720\n I'm trying to do my best to train around the injury\n\n42:17.720 --> 42:19.840\n to the extent that I can right now without, you know,\n\n42:19.840 --> 42:21.480\n hurting myself longterm.\n\n42:21.480 --> 42:23.840\n So is there a particular opponents you're thinking about?\n\n42:23.840 --> 42:25.280\n Yeah. Anybody, anybody forward?\n\n42:25.280 --> 42:27.360\n You know, I mean, I tried to, I asked,\n\n42:27.360 --> 42:28.640\n I asked the second that I got hurt,\n\n42:28.640 --> 42:30.280\n I sent a message to Dan and I said, hey man,\n\n42:30.280 --> 42:32.880\n like I just want you to be the first person to know.\n\n42:34.040 --> 42:36.560\n You know, I just was pretty reasonably injured.\n\n42:36.560 --> 42:37.440\n We just got an MRI.\n\n42:37.440 --> 42:39.120\n Doctor says like, hey man, you're out\n\n42:39.120 --> 42:41.000\n and you need to take like three weeks off, off.\n\n42:41.000 --> 42:41.840\n Don't do anything.\n\n42:41.840 --> 42:42.680\n Or you're going to immediately,\n\n42:42.680 --> 42:43.640\n you're going to tear it the whole way.\n\n42:43.640 --> 42:45.040\n And this is going to be surgery.\n\n42:45.040 --> 42:46.280\n And then it's going to be an additional,\n\n42:46.280 --> 42:47.560\n like eight weeks on top of that\n\n42:47.560 --> 42:49.520\n to start to rehab it through PT.\n\n42:49.520 --> 42:51.640\n And anyway, you know, so I let him know,\n\n42:51.640 --> 42:53.200\n hey, if you can push this thing back,\n\n42:53.200 --> 42:55.040\n I would love to keep on the car.\n\n42:55.040 --> 42:55.920\n I would love to keep the fight.\n\n42:55.920 --> 42:57.720\n You know, it's like, I respect you a lot as an opponent.\n\n42:57.720 --> 42:59.560\n And also it's been brutal trying\n\n42:59.560 --> 43:00.600\n to get anybody to sign on.\n\n43:00.600 --> 43:02.440\n So if you're into it, I'm still there.\n\n43:02.440 --> 43:03.880\n Unfortunately, he turned that down.\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:05.480\n I understand he had other things going on\n\n43:05.480 --> 43:07.720\n and he and his wife were expecting a child coming up.\n\n43:07.720 --> 43:09.760\n So he needed to, he needed to fight.\n\n43:09.760 --> 43:13.720\n And anyway, you know, I guess we'll see who's coming forward.\n\n43:13.720 --> 43:15.760\n Is there somebody like super tough\n\n43:15.760 --> 43:18.640\n in the featherweight division that you,\n\n43:18.640 --> 43:21.680\n you seem to like enjoy the difficult puzzles.\n\n43:21.680 --> 43:23.240\n Is there somebody especially difficult\n\n43:23.240 --> 43:25.440\n that you would like to fight?\n\n43:25.440 --> 43:27.040\n I would like to fight.\n\n43:27.040 --> 43:30.640\n I know that I'll need to win at least one fight before this.\n\n43:30.640 --> 43:32.160\n And I look forward to coming back\n\n43:32.160 --> 43:34.000\n and giving my best effort to do that.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:36.600\n I want to fight to beat Megumin Sharapov.\n\n43:36.600 --> 43:38.120\n I want to fight Yair Rodriguez.\n\n43:38.120 --> 43:41.480\n I want to fight Korean Zombie.\n\n43:41.480 --> 43:43.520\n And you know, this is complicated, man.\n\n43:43.520 --> 43:45.320\n Yeah, that would be fun.\n\n43:45.320 --> 43:46.680\n I would love to see that fight.\n\n43:46.680 --> 43:47.920\n That's a fascinating fight.\n\n43:47.920 --> 43:49.520\n That would be fun.\n\n43:49.520 --> 43:50.520\n He would be very challenging.\n\n43:50.520 --> 43:52.000\n All those guys are very challenging.\n\n43:52.000 --> 43:55.000\n And so I look forward to just staying healthy\n\n43:55.000 --> 43:56.400\n to the extent that we can coming back\n\n43:56.400 --> 43:58.080\n and I'm going to fight multiple times this year,\n\n43:58.080 --> 43:59.000\n hell or high water.\n\n44:00.280 --> 44:01.400\n Hell yes.\n\n44:01.400 --> 44:04.000\n Hey, by the way, I completely forgot\n\n44:04.000 --> 44:05.440\n because you were talking about the systems\n\n44:05.440 --> 44:08.920\n and decision trees and the illusion of choice\n\n44:08.920 --> 44:12.400\n made me think of Sam Harris and I forgot to mention it.\n\n44:12.400 --> 44:14.560\n So he talks about free will quite a bit\n\n44:14.560 --> 44:18.960\n and that there's an illusion of free will.\n\n44:18.960 --> 44:19.780\n So it's like the.\n\n44:19.780 --> 44:20.620\n Bold claim, Cotton.\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:23.600\n That the, you know, maybe the universe\n\n44:23.600 --> 44:27.560\n constructed that little game where it makes us feel\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:30.120\n like we have a bunch of choices, but we really don't.\n\n44:30.120 --> 44:32.760\n We're really always ending up with a middle finger.\n\n44:32.760 --> 44:33.920\n That would be hilarious.\n\n44:33.920 --> 44:35.120\n Yeah, that's it.\n\n44:35.120 --> 44:37.000\n That's what you see before you die.\n\n44:37.000 --> 44:38.880\n It's just a giant middle finger.\n\n44:38.880 --> 44:40.280\n It's like, oh, fuck.\n\n44:40.280 --> 44:41.120\n I knew it.\n\n44:41.120 --> 44:42.440\n I knew it.\n\n44:42.440 --> 44:43.260\n What do you think?\n\n44:43.260 --> 44:44.100\n Do you think there's a free will?\n\n44:44.100 --> 44:45.960\n Like we feel like we're making choices.\n\n44:45.960 --> 44:48.640\n So you're thinking, again, what we're talking about,\n\n44:48.640 --> 44:51.080\n okay, here's a system of martial arts\n\n44:51.080 --> 44:54.040\n that's Hanzo Gracie, there's different schools\n\n44:54.040 --> 44:56.400\n and whatever, and then you're thinking,\n\n44:56.400 --> 44:58.400\n okay, how can I think outside these systems?\n\n44:58.400 --> 45:03.400\n But then there's also a system that's our human society\n\n45:03.920 --> 45:08.400\n and we feel like there's an actual choice\n\n45:08.400 --> 45:11.000\n being made by us individuals.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:12.640\n Do you think that choice is real?\n\n45:12.640 --> 45:13.840\n Or is it just an illusion?\n\n45:13.840 --> 45:15.540\n Well, okay, that's a really good question.\n\n45:15.540 --> 45:17.380\n I'm not necessarily equipped to answer this,\n\n45:17.380 --> 45:18.800\n but I'll do my best.\n\n45:18.800 --> 45:21.020\n Okay, I guess I would say to start with,\n\n45:21.020 --> 45:23.240\n sure would be interesting if it wasn't real,\n\n45:23.240 --> 45:25.160\n if the choice wasn't real,\n\n45:25.160 --> 45:27.220\n would be pretty interesting if it is real.\n\n45:27.220 --> 45:29.540\n First off, I would start with facilitative beliefs\n\n45:29.540 --> 45:31.920\n versus not facilitative beliefs.\n\n45:31.920 --> 45:34.520\n It's almost like, I think the world's out to get me.\n\n45:35.540 --> 45:38.440\n True, not true, what next?\n\n45:38.440 --> 45:39.760\n Probably not a facilitative belief.\n\n45:39.760 --> 45:42.920\n Even if you, imagine you believe there's no free will.\n\n45:43.920 --> 45:45.480\n Okay, now what?\n\n45:45.480 --> 45:48.120\n Does that justify every single impulse\n\n45:48.120 --> 45:50.160\n that you're going to give into?\n\n45:50.160 --> 45:51.720\n Or does the belief in free will,\n\n45:51.720 --> 45:55.120\n does the belief in my ability to work hard, to focus,\n\n45:55.120 --> 45:57.240\n to be disciplined, to improve my position,\n\n45:57.240 --> 46:00.000\n improve my situation, whether it's true or not,\n\n46:00.000 --> 46:02.320\n although I think that at least many of us would argue\n\n46:02.320 --> 46:05.060\n that at least whether there's some sort of internal driver\n\n46:05.060 --> 46:06.700\n that allows for that.\n\n46:08.040 --> 46:09.160\n We live in a material world.\n\n46:09.160 --> 46:11.040\n Your actions do affect the world.\n\n46:11.040 --> 46:13.600\n I can choose to pick that water up or not.\n\n46:13.600 --> 46:17.080\n And anyway, I would say a belief strongly\n\n46:17.080 --> 46:20.300\n in the idea of picking facilitative beliefs,\n\n46:21.640 --> 46:24.120\n and going, hey, I will adjust,\n\n46:24.120 --> 46:26.000\n whether this belief system is right or wrong\n\n46:26.000 --> 46:28.080\n on a cosmic level, I'm nowhere near smart enough\n\n46:28.080 --> 46:32.600\n to understand, but I can say me deciding that,\n\n46:32.600 --> 46:33.960\n let's say, for instance, I'm gonna walk over\n\n46:33.960 --> 46:36.080\n to have a conversation with someone in a hotel lobby,\n\n46:36.080 --> 46:38.480\n and I've never met them, and I go over,\n\n46:38.480 --> 46:40.700\n and I start with, oh, this is gonna be interesting,\n\n46:40.700 --> 46:42.180\n and I just walk over there,\n\n46:42.180 --> 46:45.560\n versus in my head, I'm like, what's this asshole want?\n\n46:45.560 --> 46:47.880\n We're about to have two very different conversations.\n\n46:47.880 --> 46:50.160\n I could be right that this person's not very polite\n\n46:50.160 --> 46:52.920\n or thinks negatively of me right from go,\n\n46:52.920 --> 46:56.200\n but I think that that's probably not a facilitative belief.\n\n46:56.200 --> 47:00.000\n People talk about, how is that gonna help me\n\n47:00.000 --> 47:02.440\n navigate the conversation to a positive conclusion?\n\n47:02.440 --> 47:03.840\n And I think about that for,\n\n47:05.900 --> 47:07.100\n let's say, fighting, it's a good example,\n\n47:07.100 --> 47:08.940\n like confidence, plenty of people believe\n\n47:08.940 --> 47:10.440\n plenty of things that aren't real,\n\n47:10.440 --> 47:12.640\n myself included, I'm sure, all the time.\n\n47:12.640 --> 47:16.320\n And anyway, believing that you can do something,\n\n47:16.320 --> 47:17.560\n I'm like, hey, I think I can win,\n\n47:17.560 --> 47:19.120\n doesn't guarantee you a positive outcome,\n\n47:19.120 --> 47:22.160\n but I would say most of us would probably,\n\n47:22.160 --> 47:23.960\n most of us would argue that it helps.\n\n47:23.960 --> 47:25.160\n Think about depression.\n\n47:25.160 --> 47:28.040\n What's depression if not a negative,\n\n47:28.040 --> 47:31.480\n unfacilitative belief that is not always,\n\n47:31.480 --> 47:33.760\n that oftentimes is not reflected by reality,\n\n47:33.760 --> 47:35.760\n but you project it onto reality,\n\n47:35.760 --> 47:37.640\n and it's understandable if it makes you feel like,\n\n47:37.640 --> 47:39.000\n oh, man, this isn't gonna work out,\n\n47:39.000 --> 47:40.800\n I don't think the prospects are going well.\n\n47:40.800 --> 47:42.720\n And then if you feel like you can't get out of that loop,\n\n47:42.720 --> 47:44.360\n that seems pretty rough.\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:46.480\n And I see a lot of things out in society right now\n\n47:46.480 --> 47:48.480\n where you go, whether you agree or disagree\n\n47:48.480 --> 47:50.240\n with various positions on things, you go,\n\n47:50.240 --> 47:51.480\n is that a facilitative belief?\n\n47:51.480 --> 47:55.480\n Even if that is true, which is arguable, anything.\n\n47:55.480 --> 47:56.400\n So what next, man?\n\n47:56.400 --> 47:57.440\n So where does this end?\n\n47:57.440 --> 48:00.340\n When is the positive, what's the happy ending here?\n\n48:00.340 --> 48:01.760\n And if they go, well, there is no happy ending,\n\n48:01.760 --> 48:04.160\n I'm like, okay, so now what?\n\n48:04.160 --> 48:05.080\n So what do we do here?\n\n48:05.080 --> 48:06.240\n And I guess.\n\n48:06.240 --> 48:10.760\n So choose the facilitative belief, and in your intuition,\n\n48:10.760 --> 48:13.480\n believing that free will is real\n\n48:13.480 --> 48:17.440\n is more productive for a successful life.\n\n48:17.440 --> 48:19.880\n Absolutely, because otherwise, how am I not,\n\n48:21.520 --> 48:24.960\n first off, how can society function if it's not real?\n\n48:24.960 --> 48:27.840\n So how can I blame you or anyone else\n\n48:27.840 --> 48:29.680\n or hold anyone responsible for anything\n\n48:29.680 --> 48:31.600\n if free will isn't real?\n\n48:31.600 --> 48:33.360\n Well, no, that's exactly the point.\n\n48:33.360 --> 48:37.080\n But at the surface level, what you're saying is true,\n\n48:37.080 --> 48:40.200\n but perhaps if we truly internalize\n\n48:40.200 --> 48:42.280\n that free will is an illusion,\n\n48:42.280 --> 48:43.720\n we'll start to figure out something\n\n48:43.720 --> 48:47.640\n that transforms the way we see society.\n\n48:47.640 --> 48:51.080\n For example, we are very individual centric,\n\n48:51.080 --> 48:56.080\n so believing that free will is real\n\n48:56.080 --> 48:58.520\n puts a lot of responsibility and blame on people\n\n48:58.520 --> 49:01.240\n when they do something bad.\n\n49:01.240 --> 49:05.720\n Maybe if we truly internalize that free will is an illusion,\n\n49:05.720 --> 49:09.480\n we start to think about the system of humans together\n\n49:09.480 --> 49:14.240\n as this mechanism for progress,\n\n49:14.240 --> 49:17.080\n as opposed to where individual people\n\n49:17.080 --> 49:20.280\n are responsible for their actions, good or bad.\n\n49:20.280 --> 49:24.040\n So we remove the value, the weight we assign\n\n49:24.040 --> 49:27.800\n to the accomplishments or the violence,\n\n49:27.800 --> 49:29.800\n the negative stuff done by individuals,\n\n49:29.800 --> 49:32.160\n or more look at the progress of society.\n\n49:32.160 --> 49:33.200\n I don't know what that looks like,\n\n49:33.200 --> 49:35.400\n but it's almost like as opposed to focusing\n\n49:35.400 --> 49:37.640\n on the individual ants of an ant colony,\n\n49:37.640 --> 49:40.080\n looking at the entirety of the ant colony.\n\n49:41.080 --> 49:42.440\n So that, I think it makes perfect sense.\n\n49:42.440 --> 49:44.720\n I would just say that that's a reasonable thing to suggest.\n\n49:44.720 --> 49:46.360\n It's a seismic shift, right?\n\n49:46.360 --> 49:49.200\n And it's hard to say whether that would be better or worse,\n\n49:49.200 --> 49:52.080\n but I guess I'll use this as a convenient one for me.\n\n49:53.280 --> 49:54.680\n So I remember the last time we spoke,\n\n49:54.680 --> 49:58.160\n I brought up one of the most reviled evil characters\n\n49:58.160 --> 49:59.280\n in certainly recent history,\n\n49:59.280 --> 50:01.880\n probably human history period, Adolf Hitler.\n\n50:01.880 --> 50:04.440\n Well, I'm a big fan of making people live in the world\n\n50:04.440 --> 50:06.320\n that they wanna believe in.\n\n50:06.320 --> 50:08.200\n Well, if free will doesn't exist,\n\n50:08.200 --> 50:10.160\n and it's just about how things move forward,\n\n50:10.160 --> 50:13.480\n when are we gonna be high fiving this guy or what?\n\n50:13.480 --> 50:14.760\n Because I remember what I said,\n\n50:14.760 --> 50:17.600\n and that actually brings me to something else we discussed.\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:20.400\n Yeah, for people who don't know,\n\n50:20.400 --> 50:23.080\n Ryan brought up, or I brought up,\n\n50:23.080 --> 50:25.480\n there's literally a giant book about Hitler.\n\n50:25.480 --> 50:27.920\n So I've been obsessed with Hitler, World War II,\n\n50:27.920 --> 50:29.480\n and Stalin recently.\n\n50:29.480 --> 50:31.040\n For recently.\n\n50:31.040 --> 50:35.080\n Oh man, this has become like a meme.\n\n50:35.080 --> 50:37.720\n Joe Rogan with like DMT and me with Hitler.\n\n50:37.720 --> 50:40.160\n Can I pick something more positive?\n\n50:40.160 --> 50:41.920\n Like cat in the hat or something, I don't know.\n\n50:41.920 --> 50:44.320\n But you brought up Hitler as an example\n\n50:44.320 --> 50:46.200\n of something particular,\n\n50:46.200 --> 50:48.600\n some philosophical discussions we're having.\n\n50:48.600 --> 50:51.960\n And the excellent, eloquent,\n\n50:51.960 --> 50:56.960\n and the full of integrity MMA journalist\n\n50:56.960 --> 51:00.800\n clipped out something you've said about Hitler\n\n51:00.800 --> 51:05.160\n and said that, I forget what the headlines are,\n\n51:05.160 --> 51:09.520\n but they were the most ridiculous possible implementation.\n\n51:09.520 --> 51:13.080\n Basically, it was intentionally misunderstanding\n\n51:13.080 --> 51:13.920\n what I'm saying.\n\n51:13.920 --> 51:15.680\n Then it's like, I get that they're stupid,\n\n51:15.680 --> 51:16.600\n but I'm stupid too.\n\n51:16.600 --> 51:17.560\n So I know what that's like.\n\n51:17.560 --> 51:19.360\n So I don't have a lot of sympathy for you.\n\n51:19.360 --> 51:20.200\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n51:20.200 --> 51:22.920\n Yeah, exactly, I can't give you a pass on that.\n\n51:22.920 --> 51:24.840\n But basically, intentionally misunderstanding\n\n51:24.840 --> 51:25.800\n what's going on.\n\n51:25.800 --> 51:29.520\n But what I find funny is that,\n\n51:29.520 --> 51:32.000\n hey, we gotta be careful what we believe.\n\n51:32.000 --> 51:33.760\n And again, back to the cancel culture thing\n\n51:33.760 --> 51:35.440\n that we discussed last time as well,\n\n51:35.440 --> 51:37.680\n where would I like to apologize?\n\n51:37.680 --> 51:39.280\n I mean, no, actually something about cancel culture\n\n51:39.280 --> 51:40.640\n that we've been seeing things culturally,\n\n51:40.640 --> 51:43.360\n I'm like, I will be damned if I apologize for anything\n\n51:43.360 --> 51:44.640\n that I don't need to apologize for\n\n51:44.640 --> 51:46.960\n because I was intentionally misunderstood in that instance.\n\n51:46.960 --> 51:50.600\n Now, you could say that I'm not a historical scholar,\n\n51:50.600 --> 51:51.480\n which I would agree immediately.\n\n51:51.480 --> 51:54.200\n And also that I oftentimes in eloquently\n\n51:54.200 --> 51:57.520\n or inarticulately phrase things, which I'll agree is again.\n\n51:57.520 --> 52:01.040\n But ultimately, going, hey, I wanna make you believe,\n\n52:01.040 --> 52:04.680\n live in the world that you're suggesting ought to exist.\n\n52:05.800 --> 52:07.600\n Okay, so if there's no free will,\n\n52:10.400 --> 52:13.120\n how far of a step back are we willing to take cosmically\n\n52:13.120 --> 52:15.280\n before we start going, hey, this is good\n\n52:15.280 --> 52:18.840\n because we're experiencing a social reckoning\n\n52:18.840 --> 52:20.600\n in our country at the moment,\n\n52:20.600 --> 52:23.880\n for good and for other probably, I guess.\n\n52:23.880 --> 52:27.120\n And basically, but hey, it all worked out, right?\n\n52:27.120 --> 52:30.520\n So that's probably not something that would fly.\n\n52:30.520 --> 52:32.440\n And I think that's a fair thing.\n\n52:32.440 --> 52:33.720\n That's interesting.\n\n52:33.720 --> 52:35.560\n It might not fly from the individual perspective,\n\n52:35.560 --> 52:38.400\n but if you zoom out and think,\n\n52:38.400 --> 52:42.840\n appreciate society as just like an ant colony\n\n52:42.840 --> 52:45.040\n as a beautifully complex system,\n\n52:45.040 --> 52:49.200\n like we kinda, from the individual perspective,\n\n52:49.200 --> 52:52.640\n we value progress, especially progress of the individual,\n\n52:52.640 --> 52:54.840\n but in whole progress of societies.\n\n52:54.840 --> 52:57.280\n But if you accept that this is just a complex system\n\n52:57.280 --> 52:59.760\n that's not necessarily headed anywhere,\n\n52:59.760 --> 53:02.920\n that this is almost like that river is just flowing,\n\n53:02.920 --> 53:07.440\n I think that removes the burden of always striving,\n\n53:07.440 --> 53:10.560\n of always trying, of always like the struggle and so on.\n\n53:10.560 --> 53:13.960\n So it's possible that if we have no control,\n\n53:13.960 --> 53:17.040\n you can like arrive at some kind of other zen state.\n\n53:17.040 --> 53:18.640\n Does that sound very human though?\n\n53:18.640 --> 53:22.920\n That goes against, I think,\n\n53:24.440 --> 53:29.440\n our current human condition as we experience it,\n\n53:29.560 --> 53:31.280\n but we've communicated that to each other.\n\n53:31.280 --> 53:34.440\n Like we've taught, like through these social forces,\n\n53:34.440 --> 53:38.120\n taught each other that our lives matter and so on.\n\n53:38.120 --> 53:40.520\n Maybe if we convince ourselves\n\n53:40.520 --> 53:45.520\n that we're just sort of like little things in a stream\n\n53:45.560 --> 53:47.360\n and ultimately none of it matters,\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:48.720\n there might be some kind of enjoyment\n\n53:48.720 --> 53:50.120\n to be discovered through that process.\n\n53:50.120 --> 53:54.160\n I don't, listen, I'm a capitalist, rah, rah, like.\n\n53:54.160 --> 53:56.120\n But I guess I think you bring up a really important point.\n\n53:56.120 --> 53:58.280\n I guess almost anything like capitalism,\n\n53:58.280 --> 54:01.720\n I only get to experience it as I sit here now\n\n54:01.720 --> 54:03.960\n and I get to live, I was raised in the United States,\n\n54:03.960 --> 54:05.480\n have traveled around the world a little bit,\n\n54:05.480 --> 54:07.840\n have had the good fortune of meeting many people\n\n54:07.840 --> 54:09.200\n from many different places.\n\n54:09.200 --> 54:12.840\n And I'm an end user of capitalism.\n\n54:12.840 --> 54:14.320\n I don't really know how it got here,\n\n54:14.320 --> 54:16.760\n whether it was, I wasn't there at the start of this idea.\n\n54:16.760 --> 54:19.280\n I wasn't there for, hey, how did we come up with this idea?\n\n54:19.280 --> 54:20.120\n How did we arrive?\n\n54:20.120 --> 54:20.960\n And I'm nowhere near well read enough\n\n54:20.960 --> 54:24.920\n to understand any of that really even secondhand.\n\n54:24.920 --> 54:27.360\n And I guess recognizing that communism,\n\n54:27.360 --> 54:30.580\n Marxism, socialism, anarchism, anything is,\n\n54:30.580 --> 54:33.200\n these are all perspectives that all have,\n\n54:33.200 --> 54:35.580\n I guess, various strengths and weaknesses.\n\n54:35.580 --> 54:37.760\n But I guess one thing I'm always,\n\n54:37.760 --> 54:39.080\n I guess I would say the burden,\n\n54:39.080 --> 54:42.280\n it seems to me that if you wanna make a change,\n\n54:42.280 --> 54:45.880\n the burden of proof is on the person\n\n54:45.880 --> 54:47.720\n implying that there needs to be a change.\n\n54:47.720 --> 54:49.860\n And it doesn't mean that there's nothing there,\n\n54:49.860 --> 54:51.840\n but it's like if you wanna create a small shift,\n\n54:51.840 --> 54:52.680\n a ripple, that's fine,\n\n54:52.680 --> 54:55.680\n but a seismic ripping shift in how we exist\n\n54:55.680 --> 54:57.360\n or how we experience the world as human beings.\n\n54:57.360 --> 54:58.460\n And you mentioned fighting,\n\n54:58.460 --> 55:01.120\n why watching someone undergo,\n\n55:01.120 --> 55:05.120\n take abuse on a level in the ring that's just shocking\n\n55:05.120 --> 55:07.800\n and then triumph in spite of it is like,\n\n55:07.800 --> 55:09.200\n this is unbelievable.\n\n55:09.200 --> 55:11.660\n This is part of the magic of combat sports.\n\n55:11.660 --> 55:13.080\n Now, it's part of the magic,\n\n55:13.080 --> 55:13.920\n the other side of the magic\n\n55:13.920 --> 55:15.120\n that doesn't get talked about sometimes\n\n55:15.120 --> 55:19.000\n is that the trajectory of that individual's life later on\n\n55:19.000 --> 55:20.600\n is not always great,\n\n55:20.600 --> 55:22.760\n or let me rephrase, there's a cost for that.\n\n55:22.760 --> 55:27.760\n But if we remember, you mentioned removing the struggle.\n\n55:28.160 --> 55:33.040\n I don't personally, the struggle is what makes life life.\n\n55:33.040 --> 55:35.480\n And also, I guess, something Faraz has brought up to me\n\n55:35.480 --> 55:38.640\n on a number of occasions, and it makes sense to me,\n\n55:38.640 --> 55:42.480\n it's basically humans only understand things\n\n55:42.480 --> 55:43.760\n through relative comparison.\n\n55:43.760 --> 55:47.680\n I only understand heat because I've known cold.\n\n55:47.680 --> 55:50.180\n I only understand, it's like talking to someone\n\n55:50.180 --> 55:52.400\n that's never experienced any sort of hardship\n\n55:52.400 --> 55:54.440\n and then their latte isn't right,\n\n55:54.440 --> 55:56.320\n and then they pitch a fit\n\n55:56.320 --> 55:57.720\n versus someone that's gone through\n\n55:57.720 --> 56:00.940\n a great deal of challenge, struggle in their life.\n\n56:00.940 --> 56:03.680\n They tend to have a little bit more of an even perspective.\n\n56:03.680 --> 56:07.360\n And anyway, and of course, even as a relative thing\n\n56:07.360 --> 56:09.120\n and what I perceive to be even may not be even,\n\n56:09.120 --> 56:10.600\n maybe I'm particularly softer\n\n56:10.600 --> 56:12.680\n or something in the other direction without realizing,\n\n56:12.680 --> 56:14.640\n because I can only understand what I can understand.\n\n56:14.640 --> 56:19.400\n But the idea that we wanna fundamentally alter ourselves\n\n56:19.400 --> 56:21.040\n as a species and as people\n\n56:21.040 --> 56:25.360\n seems like an incredibly, incredibly high bar to prove,\n\n56:25.360 --> 56:27.800\n and also like an incredibly dangerous idea,\n\n56:27.800 --> 56:29.200\n because it always comes back to,\n\n56:29.200 --> 56:31.080\n well, who's gonna be responsible for this?\n\n56:31.080 --> 56:32.600\n Who gets to do the choosing?\n\n56:32.600 --> 56:33.440\n What's a good idea?\n\n56:33.440 --> 56:34.280\n What's not a good idea?\n\n56:34.280 --> 56:36.440\n And I guess that actually brings me kind of to a,\n\n56:36.440 --> 56:38.080\n something I've been encountering recently\n\n56:38.080 --> 56:40.200\n in discussions with friends.\n\n56:40.200 --> 56:42.720\n I feel like there's only two types of people\n\n56:42.720 --> 56:44.600\n that I encounter at this point.\n\n56:46.120 --> 56:48.920\n People with a more or less libertarian tilt\n\n56:48.920 --> 56:51.200\n to their thinking and people without it.\n\n56:51.200 --> 56:52.240\n And when I say libertarian,\n\n56:52.240 --> 56:54.120\n I don't mean that in the political party sense\n\n56:54.120 --> 56:55.400\n or even the belief system.\n\n56:55.400 --> 56:57.880\n Basically, I'm like, hey, you do you buddy.\n\n56:57.880 --> 57:00.320\n It's not my, what you're up to is not my concern\n\n57:00.320 --> 57:01.960\n versus what you're up to is my concern.\n\n57:01.960 --> 57:03.720\n And I guess I've always watched,\n\n57:03.720 --> 57:05.480\n various points in history, people on this side\n\n57:05.480 --> 57:08.800\n or people on that side are more or less,\n\n57:08.800 --> 57:10.920\n I guess, problematic, I guess you could say.\n\n57:10.920 --> 57:13.480\n And I don't mean that in the internet sense,\n\n57:13.480 --> 57:15.160\n you know, more of an issue,\n\n57:15.160 --> 57:18.520\n but the world is always full of people\n\n57:18.520 --> 57:20.920\n that wanna tell you what you need to be doing\n\n57:20.920 --> 57:22.760\n as opposed to more or less doing no harm.\n\n57:22.760 --> 57:24.040\n And I guess that's one of the ones,\n\n57:24.040 --> 57:26.880\n anytime I'm trying to tell other people what to do,\n\n57:26.880 --> 57:28.040\n I better hope I'm right.\n\n57:28.040 --> 57:30.640\n And it's bizarre to me how many people are so confident\n\n57:30.640 --> 57:33.080\n that their side or their position is the one\n\n57:33.080 --> 57:34.320\n that's not only right for them,\n\n57:34.320 --> 57:36.440\n but right enough that they can enforce it on others.\n\n57:36.440 --> 57:38.840\n And that just seems incredibly dangerous to me.\n\n57:38.840 --> 57:41.400\n And I guess that comes back to even Sam's point\n\n57:41.400 --> 57:43.600\n about, oh, we want to,\n\n57:43.600 --> 57:46.240\n trying to spread the idea that free will doesn't exist.\n\n57:46.240 --> 57:48.440\n I'm not saying it's damaging, but it very well may be.\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:50.000\n And plenty of other things could be as well.\n\n57:50.000 --> 57:52.000\n I'm not, you know, it goes way over my head\n\n57:52.000 --> 57:53.760\n as to the implications of all of these.\n\n57:53.760 --> 57:56.320\n And I guess all of us are in evangelist for something,\n\n57:56.320 --> 58:00.880\n but I guess it's weird that we've gotten this far\n\n58:00.880 --> 58:05.280\n as a species and now we wanna take like sharp, sharp turns.\n\n58:05.280 --> 58:06.840\n Well, we've been taking a bunch of sharp turns\n\n58:06.840 --> 58:07.680\n throughout history.\n\n58:07.680 --> 58:08.520\n Yeah.\n\n58:08.520 --> 58:11.680\n That's what, you know, that's the way,\n\n58:11.680 --> 58:13.960\n you know, okay, humans love power.\n\n58:13.960 --> 58:16.060\n And one way to attain power is to say,\n\n58:16.060 --> 58:18.160\n everything that you guys are doing is wrong\n\n58:18.160 --> 58:19.320\n and I have the right thing\n\n58:19.320 --> 58:21.880\n and I'm gonna build up a giant cult of people\n\n58:21.880 --> 58:23.520\n and I'm gonna overthrow.\n\n58:23.520 --> 58:27.240\n And indirectly what that results in me is me gaining power.\n\n58:27.240 --> 58:30.200\n And that's how you get all the big revolutions\n\n58:30.200 --> 58:32.800\n in human history, saying I'm done with the thing\n\n58:32.800 --> 58:35.160\n that the powerful are currently doing.\n\n58:35.160 --> 58:36.240\n So I'm gonna overthrow.\n\n58:36.240 --> 58:39.800\n That's where probably all the identity politics\n\n58:39.800 --> 58:43.180\n that's happening now is people that didn't have power before\n\n58:43.180 --> 58:45.040\n are looking to gain power.\n\n58:45.040 --> 58:46.580\n And they're also, you know,\n\n58:46.580 --> 58:49.740\n that's where Jordan Peterson criticized identity politics\n\n58:49.740 --> 58:53.920\n is people with the right, with the good intentions,\n\n58:53.920 --> 58:57.960\n I should say, are in seeking power,\n\n58:57.960 --> 59:01.840\n allow power to corrupt them as power always does.\n\n59:01.840 --> 59:06.840\n And so they lose track of like the devils\n\n59:07.280 --> 59:11.360\n that they're fighting by becoming the same kind of devils,\n\n59:11.360 --> 59:13.800\n the same kind of evil that they're fighting.\n\n59:13.800 --> 59:15.960\n And so that's just the progress of human history.\n\n59:15.960 --> 59:20.400\n But hopefully as these power greedy people\n\n59:20.400 --> 59:24.720\n keep attaining power with a progressive mindset,\n\n59:24.720 --> 59:27.080\n over time things get better and better as they have been.\n\n59:27.080 --> 59:27.960\n Like each iteration?\n\n59:27.960 --> 59:29.080\n Each iteration.\n\n59:29.080 --> 59:31.600\n A lot of unfairness happens.\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:35.160\n A lot of hypocrisy happens.\n\n59:35.160 --> 59:38.280\n A lot of people are trampled along the way\n\n59:38.280 --> 59:40.480\n by those who mean well.\n\n59:40.480 --> 59:42.520\n But over time, like lessons are learned\n\n59:42.520 --> 59:46.360\n or like human civilization accumulates lessons\n\n59:46.360 --> 59:49.240\n and in part learns lessons of history\n\n59:49.240 --> 59:50.800\n and it gets better and better over time,\n\n59:50.800 --> 59:52.840\n even though in the short term,\n\n59:52.840 --> 59:55.380\n there's people acting not their best selves.\n\n59:55.380 --> 59:59.840\n And you know, that seems to be the progress\n\n59:59.840 --> 1:00:01.160\n of human history.\n\n1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:05.480\n The idea of internalizing the free will not being real.\n\n1:00:05.480 --> 1:00:07.320\n I mean, you're actually making me realize\n\n1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:09.320\n that that ultimately leads to a kind of.\n\n1:00:11.080 --> 1:00:12.680\n Doesn't that go in a nihilistic direction?\n\n1:00:12.680 --> 1:00:14.660\n Yeah, it's both nihilistic\n\n1:00:14.660 --> 1:00:16.840\n or if you want to make it a political system,\n\n1:00:16.840 --> 1:00:19.820\n then it's more like communist type of a system\n\n1:00:19.820 --> 1:00:22.560\n where like the value of the individual\n\n1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:25.960\n is completely reduced, removed.\n\n1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.640\n Or another perspective is like the freedom of an individual\n\n1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:32.400\n is not to be valued or protected.\n\n1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:35.240\n And so from our current perspective,\n\n1:00:35.240 --> 1:00:36.760\n the systems that seem to have worked,\n\n1:00:36.760 --> 1:00:39.560\n the United States works pretty damn well,\n\n1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:41.240\n despite all the different criticisms.\n\n1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.040\n It seems like freedom of the individual\n\n1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:47.240\n in all its forms seems to be fundamental\n\n1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:49.400\n to the success of the United States.\n\n1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:53.560\n And so we should, it's a, however the hell you put it,\n\n1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:55.840\n is like, it doesn't matter whether free will\n\n1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:58.040\n is or isn't an illusion.\n\n1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:00.920\n The belief that it's real.\n\n1:01:00.920 --> 1:01:02.480\n Protects the individual from the group,\n\n1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:04.160\n which is fundamentally, correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:06.520\n that always seems like the big issue of history.\n\n1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:09.380\n Hey, there's more of me than there is of you.\n\n1:01:09.380 --> 1:01:10.220\n Deal with it.\n\n1:01:10.220 --> 1:01:11.640\n You're like, yikes.\n\n1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:12.800\n And you want to be yourself.\n\n1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:13.640\n You want to be different.\n\n1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:14.840\n You want to have a different religion.\n\n1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:15.960\n You want to be a different skin color.\n\n1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:16.800\n You want to do this.\n\n1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:19.040\n All the bad tribal things happen\n\n1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:20.880\n when there's more of me than you.\n\n1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:21.720\n Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:23.320\n Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:24.440\n But then that's always the fundamental\n\n1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:26.120\n power imbalance though, right?\n\n1:01:26.120 --> 1:01:28.520\n Well, the interesting thing about the libertarian thinking,\n\n1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:30.000\n I guess I, I don't know.\n\n1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:30.840\n Those words are really.\n\n1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:32.080\n Maybe they're all charged, I know actually.\n\n1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:33.000\n Yeah, they're all charged.\n\n1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.760\n I may not scale up, but I mean,\n\n1:01:34.760 --> 1:01:36.320\n more like on a philosophical underpinning\n\n1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.480\n where you're like, yeah, basically,\n\n1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:39.800\n hey, you feel free to believe I'm a fool.\n\n1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:42.120\n And I mean, plenty of people do, I'm sure.\n\n1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:44.940\n But as long as you don't chase me down the hall\n\n1:01:44.940 --> 1:01:47.240\n and hit me in the back of the head with a textbook,\n\n1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:48.200\n what's the big deal?\n\n1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:50.760\n Yeah, so the libertarian viewpoint,\n\n1:01:50.760 --> 1:01:53.120\n which I probably espouse, like that's,\n\n1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:57.320\n I'm very much like freedom of the individual\n\n1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:00.720\n is very valuable and like leave others the fuck alone\n\n1:02:00.720 --> 1:02:02.960\n unless they're trying to hurt you.\n\n1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:05.920\n The thing is you also have to, I believe,\n\n1:02:05.920 --> 1:02:09.640\n put in the work of empathy of understanding\n\n1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:13.040\n what others, how, what leaving people\n\n1:02:13.040 --> 1:02:14.880\n the fuck alone means to others.\n\n1:02:14.880 --> 1:02:16.160\n But isn't that an interesting thing?\n\n1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.640\n If I believe in freedom of the individual\n\n1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.300\n and I take that, like all of these, like you said,\n\n1:02:20.300 --> 1:02:22.960\n you take them past just their first why question.\n\n1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:26.240\n You ask why, why, why, why, or how, how, how, how many times.\n\n1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:28.720\n Should that not extend to respect for you,\n\n1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:29.860\n respect for your position,\n\n1:02:29.860 --> 1:02:32.120\n respect for your individual lived experience,\n\n1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:34.560\n which could be grossly different than mine.\n\n1:02:34.560 --> 1:02:36.520\n Yeah, this is the problem with saying,\n\n1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:38.840\n I'm an individual, I'm not gonna bother you,\n\n1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.360\n you don't bother me.\n\n1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.180\n That's just like, that's not actionable.\n\n1:02:43.180 --> 1:02:45.680\n Because to be, to make it actionable,\n\n1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.680\n you have to think the why, why, why, why, why,\n\n1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:49.560\n you have to do the steps beyond.\n\n1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:50.880\n You think, what does that actually mean?\n\n1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:54.840\n That means understanding how even my very existence\n\n1:02:55.920 --> 1:02:57.320\n like hurts others.\n\n1:02:57.320 --> 1:03:00.120\n Because you have to understand that like,\n\n1:03:00.120 --> 1:03:02.220\n I'm not, you're not just sitting alone in a room.\n\n1:03:02.220 --> 1:03:04.880\n You're using like public transit,\n\n1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:06.120\n you're using the police force,\n\n1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:09.080\n you're using firefighters, you're using the,\n\n1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:11.160\n like you're using a lot of resources\n\n1:03:11.160 --> 1:03:12.900\n that are publicly shared.\n\n1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:17.900\n And some of those resources are unfairly distributed.\n\n1:03:17.900 --> 1:03:21.820\n Like we've agreed that we're gonna pay taxes\n\n1:03:21.820 --> 1:03:24.180\n and those taxes are gonna go towards\n\n1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:25.980\n building some kind of infrastructure.\n\n1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:27.740\n So that's already towards social.\n\n1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:31.140\n So you're not a real, you're not a real sort of,\n\n1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.220\n I talked to Michael Malice, like anarchist, right?\n\n1:03:33.220 --> 1:03:37.780\n Saying like basically, full, just leave me the fuck alone\n\n1:03:37.780 --> 1:03:40.860\n and I'm going to collaborate with whoever the hell I want.\n\n1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:43.900\n We're not, that's not the American society\n\n1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:45.500\n as it stands currently.\n\n1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:47.900\n We've agreed that there's going to be\n\n1:03:47.900 --> 1:03:51.700\n certain social institutions that we pay into.\n\n1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:55.100\n And some of the sort of discussions about race\n\n1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:56.540\n and all those kinds of things\n\n1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:02.780\n is about those institutions being institutionally unfair,\n\n1:04:03.860 --> 1:04:05.980\n whether it's race or gender, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:09.580\n Listen, I have a bunch of criticisms\n\n1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:11.980\n of the way that conversation carries itself out,\n\n1:04:11.980 --> 1:04:15.580\n but the thing is, what's valuable is to actually listen\n\n1:04:15.580 --> 1:04:16.860\n and empathize.\n\n1:04:16.860 --> 1:04:20.500\n And that's not often talked about\n\n1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:23.340\n with the leave me the fuck alone mindset\n\n1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:28.340\n because you're, it doesn't have that little component\n\n1:04:29.420 --> 1:04:31.580\n which I think could be fundamental\n\n1:04:31.580 --> 1:04:34.220\n to the function of a society, which is like social.\n\n1:04:34.220 --> 1:04:38.900\n Like it's the, what is it, the Obama, you didn't build it\n\n1:04:38.900 --> 1:04:41.220\n or you didn't build it alone or whatever,\n\n1:04:41.220 --> 1:04:42.060\n however that goes.\n\n1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:45.580\n But basically we wouldn't be able to accomplish anything\n\n1:04:45.580 --> 1:04:48.140\n as individuals without the help of others.\n\n1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:50.460\n And to be able to then start to think,\n\n1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:54.940\n okay, so what is my duty?\n\n1:04:54.940 --> 1:04:57.580\n What is my responsibility to other human beings\n\n1:04:57.580 --> 1:05:01.140\n to be respectful, to be loving, to help them\n\n1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:03.020\n as part of this functioning society?\n\n1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:04.860\n That starts, that's actually a lot of work\n\n1:05:04.860 --> 1:05:06.300\n to start to think about that.\n\n1:05:06.300 --> 1:05:07.460\n Because then I have to like think,\n\n1:05:07.460 --> 1:05:09.580\n okay, Ryan, what's his life like?\n\n1:05:09.580 --> 1:05:12.980\n As a business owner during COVID, what's that like?\n\n1:05:12.980 --> 1:05:16.340\n And then he has, there's employees that run the gym.\n\n1:05:16.340 --> 1:05:17.220\n What's that like?\n\n1:05:17.220 --> 1:05:18.620\n What's that stress like?\n\n1:05:18.620 --> 1:05:20.340\n Or about the fighting and the injury and so on.\n\n1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:21.180\n What's that like?\n\n1:05:21.180 --> 1:05:24.380\n That empathy takes a lot of like compute cycles.\n\n1:05:24.380 --> 1:05:26.740\n And also a lot of energy, right?\n\n1:05:26.740 --> 1:05:29.220\n But I have to go through that computation\n\n1:05:29.220 --> 1:05:34.060\n if I want to be an individual that's like,\n\n1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:35.860\n doesn't hurt you.\n\n1:05:35.860 --> 1:05:38.740\n If I may, I guess like to come back to Muhammad Ali,\n\n1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:40.420\n one of the things he said is service to others\n\n1:05:40.420 --> 1:05:43.620\n is the rent that you pay for your,\n\n1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:45.500\n is the price you pay for your rent here on earth.\n\n1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:48.620\n And now one of the things that I think that I see\n\n1:05:48.620 --> 1:05:50.060\n as a result of the internet all the time\n\n1:05:50.060 --> 1:05:53.740\n is people talking about global giant problems,\n\n1:05:53.740 --> 1:05:56.540\n social problems that are society wide,\n\n1:05:56.540 --> 1:05:59.060\n that are massive, truly massive.\n\n1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:04.060\n And frankly, beyond the power of any of us to solve.\n\n1:06:04.220 --> 1:06:06.060\n That's certainly on an individual level.\n\n1:06:06.060 --> 1:06:08.420\n So I've discussed things with friends.\n\n1:06:08.420 --> 1:06:10.260\n Like my father's an environmental attorney,\n\n1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:12.340\n like has been for a long time\n\n1:06:12.340 --> 1:06:14.220\n and has been an engineer for a long time.\n\n1:06:14.220 --> 1:06:17.340\n And so I'm not, barely know anything,\n\n1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:19.460\n but I'm read in a little bit of various things.\n\n1:06:19.460 --> 1:06:21.980\n But climate change, oh my God,\n\n1:06:21.980 --> 1:06:23.820\n I'm so concerned about climate change.\n\n1:06:23.820 --> 1:06:25.420\n What am I supposed to do about climate change?\n\n1:06:25.420 --> 1:06:27.540\n I'll tell you what I can do is I can not litter.\n\n1:06:27.540 --> 1:06:30.260\n I can try to conserve energy where I can.\n\n1:06:30.260 --> 1:06:31.340\n I can do whatever I want.\n\n1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:36.340\n What can I personally do about some giant social problem\n\n1:06:36.340 --> 1:06:40.260\n that I didn't start and is out of my control?\n\n1:06:40.260 --> 1:06:42.780\n I'm like, well, I can be decent to the people around me.\n\n1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:44.620\n I can mention, I can demonstrate empathy\n\n1:06:44.620 --> 1:06:46.180\n and I can demonstrate consideration\n\n1:06:46.180 --> 1:06:47.780\n for the people in my circle.\n\n1:06:47.780 --> 1:06:50.400\n And to the extent that I can the people outside of my circle,\n\n1:06:50.400 --> 1:06:53.440\n but yelling at the trees over problems\n\n1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:57.220\n that are borderline cosmic, doesn't seem very productive.\n\n1:06:57.220 --> 1:06:59.420\n It just makes me feel like I'm cool and important\n\n1:06:59.420 --> 1:07:00.740\n because I'm talking about something,\n\n1:07:00.740 --> 1:07:02.700\n well, hundreds of years from now, the water will rise.\n\n1:07:02.700 --> 1:07:04.060\n Maybe it will, maybe it won't.\n\n1:07:04.060 --> 1:07:06.180\n It's completely on my head, I know nothing.\n\n1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:09.340\n But focusing on the problems that we can actually solve,\n\n1:07:09.340 --> 1:07:10.480\n it comes back to the same thing.\n\n1:07:10.480 --> 1:07:11.420\n I want to win a fight.\n\n1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:13.300\n I would love to win a fight.\n\n1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:14.180\n I can't control that.\n\n1:07:14.180 --> 1:07:16.320\n What I can do is I can control each individual step\n\n1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:17.260\n that I take around the ring\n\n1:07:17.260 --> 1:07:19.200\n and try to make the next correct move.\n\n1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:22.420\n I can't look, no, it gets people's,\n\n1:07:22.420 --> 1:07:24.220\n you know, they get all excited.\n\n1:07:24.220 --> 1:07:25.900\n You know, I'm trying to keep my language in check,\n\n1:07:25.900 --> 1:07:28.140\n but they get all excited thinking about, you know,\n\n1:07:28.140 --> 1:07:30.460\n problems that are like Superman\n\n1:07:30.460 --> 1:07:32.340\n couldn't solve these problems.\n\n1:07:32.340 --> 1:07:34.140\n Like you could be that powerful\n\n1:07:34.140 --> 1:07:36.500\n and you can't make all of the bad things go away,\n\n1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:38.380\n but you can absolutely change yourself.\n\n1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:40.540\n And I think a lot of the lessons that, you know,\n\n1:07:40.540 --> 1:07:42.860\n like the good lessons from religion that happened,\n\n1:07:42.860 --> 1:07:44.620\n the good lessons from the great men and women\n\n1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:47.340\n throughout history that we're inspired by,\n\n1:07:47.340 --> 1:07:50.020\n that talk about change starting with within,\n\n1:07:50.020 --> 1:07:50.980\n and, you know, again,\n\n1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:52.620\n treating the people around you decently\n\n1:07:52.620 --> 1:07:53.980\n and treating the people around you decently\n\n1:07:53.980 --> 1:07:55.920\n doesn't even necessarily mean the golden rule.\n\n1:07:55.920 --> 1:07:57.940\n Do unto others as you would like them to do to you.\n\n1:07:57.940 --> 1:08:00.220\n I go, well, maybe what I would like\n\n1:08:00.220 --> 1:08:02.060\n and what this person would like aren't the same thing.\n\n1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:03.420\n Well, how am I going to get to the bottom of that?\n\n1:08:03.420 --> 1:08:05.780\n Cause I could be attempting to be decent to this person.\n\n1:08:05.780 --> 1:08:07.300\n And by my standards, I am being decent,\n\n1:08:07.300 --> 1:08:09.820\n but maybe I'm missing the mark by theirs.\n\n1:08:09.820 --> 1:08:13.140\n Well, I can't possibly, if I just interacted with you,\n\n1:08:13.140 --> 1:08:14.180\n like it's like someone talking about\n\n1:08:14.180 --> 1:08:15.540\n some nonsense microaggression.\n\n1:08:15.540 --> 1:08:16.600\n You're like, so let me get this straight.\n\n1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:17.440\n I've never met you before.\n\n1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:18.700\n You never met me before.\n\n1:08:18.700 --> 1:08:20.720\n And you're interpreting some minor comment\n\n1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:24.240\n that I've made in the least charitable way possible.\n\n1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:25.980\n I'm not saying that you couldn't be annoyed,\n\n1:08:25.980 --> 1:08:29.140\n but your expectation for that level of consideration\n\n1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:31.960\n is you're going to be disappointed a lot.\n\n1:08:31.960 --> 1:08:34.540\n Now, if you, if we're someone that's in your life\n\n1:08:34.540 --> 1:08:35.980\n on a consistent basis and they're like,\n\n1:08:35.980 --> 1:08:37.300\n hey, I really don't appreciate what you're saying\n\n1:08:37.300 --> 1:08:38.140\n or what you're doing here.\n\n1:08:38.140 --> 1:08:40.020\n Do you realize that this is how I'm,\n\n1:08:40.020 --> 1:08:42.340\n this is how I'm perceiving you go, oh man, I'm so sorry.\n\n1:08:42.340 --> 1:08:44.200\n Of course I would hear what you have to say,\n\n1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:47.580\n but I guess trying to recognize that, you know,\n\n1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:52.480\n I guess my job is to treat others with dignity in general,\n\n1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:55.060\n but that level of the level of specificity that,\n\n1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.940\n that, that, that requires increases\n\n1:08:56.940 --> 1:08:58.340\n as it gets closer to you.\n\n1:08:58.340 --> 1:08:59.860\n And I have, as a person,\n\n1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:02.820\n I have a very finite amount of resources financially,\n\n1:09:02.820 --> 1:09:05.680\n intellectually, emotionally, physically.\n\n1:09:05.680 --> 1:09:08.480\n If I chuck, you know, 0.001% of it\n\n1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:11.320\n in every single different direction, what am I doing?\n\n1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:12.160\n It's like when people are like,\n\n1:09:12.160 --> 1:09:13.820\n oh, I care deeply about Tibet.\n\n1:09:13.820 --> 1:09:15.180\n I'm like, why aren't you over there?\n\n1:09:15.180 --> 1:09:16.460\n Go build a house, man.\n\n1:09:16.460 --> 1:09:18.580\n Get on a plane, go build a house.\n\n1:09:18.580 --> 1:09:19.520\n Oh, you don't want to do that.\n\n1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.500\n So really what you want to do is post on Facebook\n\n1:09:21.500 --> 1:09:23.160\n and, and, and accept high fives\n\n1:09:23.160 --> 1:09:24.680\n for how much of a good guy you are.\n\n1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:25.660\n I got an idea.\n\n1:09:25.660 --> 1:09:27.180\n Go help somebody in your neighborhood.\n\n1:09:27.180 --> 1:09:29.420\n Go be, go play with, go play with some kids.\n\n1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:31.780\n Go be a friend to someone that doesn't have a friend.\n\n1:09:31.780 --> 1:09:33.740\n Read a book, try to educate yourself.\n\n1:09:33.740 --> 1:09:35.460\n And so I guess to, to come back,\n\n1:09:35.460 --> 1:09:38.920\n it's all of these problems aren't solvable on a grand scale,\n\n1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:41.740\n but it's almost like by attempting to address them\n\n1:09:41.740 --> 1:09:43.700\n in our personal lives, we do better.\n\n1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:46.440\n But rather than a giant airing of the grievances\n\n1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:48.300\n on a, on a consistent basis,\n\n1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:49.340\n not that that isn't, you know,\n\n1:09:49.340 --> 1:09:51.300\n sometimes necessary and valuable,\n\n1:09:51.300 --> 1:09:53.740\n but after you air your grievances, you go,\n\n1:09:53.740 --> 1:09:55.380\n hey, how about we, we sort this out?\n\n1:09:55.380 --> 1:09:56.720\n What's the next step?\n\n1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:58.220\n And, and I guess, again,\n\n1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:01.220\n when we're trying to address it on a giant social level,\n\n1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:02.420\n it just seems unmanageable to me,\n\n1:10:02.420 --> 1:10:04.580\n even if you have the best of intentions.\n\n1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.740\n Yeah, I mean, but nevertheless, there's,\n\n1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:09.340\n there's a lot you can do on social networks.\n\n1:10:09.340 --> 1:10:12.980\n I mean, I enjoy tweeting and consuming Twitter.\n\n1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:15.260\n It's just, I apply the exact same principle\n\n1:10:15.260 --> 1:10:19.380\n that you just said, which is free will and discussion,\n\n1:10:19.380 --> 1:10:23.500\n which is like, I approach it in a way\n\n1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:27.480\n that I don't get stuck in this loop that's counterproductive.\n\n1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:30.660\n I try to do things that are productive.\n\n1:10:30.660 --> 1:10:32.540\n And like, it's just like you said,\n\n1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:36.420\n that's like, like what kind of things can I do in this world?\n\n1:10:36.420 --> 1:10:38.620\n Whether that's tweeting or building things,\n\n1:10:38.620 --> 1:10:41.040\n those are low effort tweeting,\n\n1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:42.540\n or actually building businesses\n\n1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.700\n or building ideas out as high effort.\n\n1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:47.780\n What can I do that will actually solve problems?\n\n1:10:47.780 --> 1:10:49.780\n And that's, that's the way I approach it.\n\n1:10:49.780 --> 1:10:53.020\n And I do wonder if it's possible to at scale,\n\n1:10:53.020 --> 1:10:56.540\n encourage each other to approach like social media\n\n1:10:56.540 --> 1:10:58.980\n and communication with fellow humans in that way.\n\n1:10:58.980 --> 1:10:59.820\n I don't know.\n\n1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:00.940\n How do you think that would be done?\n\n1:11:00.940 --> 1:11:02.140\n I guess, like to improve the,\n\n1:11:02.140 --> 1:11:03.860\n improve the quality of discourse, maybe.\n\n1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:04.820\n Like, or even like you said,\n\n1:11:04.820 --> 1:11:07.100\n the empathy or the decency of discourse.\n\n1:11:07.100 --> 1:11:09.020\n I think people should be, you know,\n\n1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:12.100\n incentivized, encouraged to do that.\n\n1:11:12.100 --> 1:11:14.900\n I think most of what's,\n\n1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:18.260\n we see happening on Twitter and Facebook and so on\n\n1:11:18.260 --> 1:11:20.740\n has to do with very small,\n\n1:11:20.740 --> 1:11:25.060\n very powerful implementation details.\n\n1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:27.420\n It goes down to like, what is the source\n\n1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:30.500\n of the dopamine rush, the like button,\n\n1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.500\n the sharing mechanisms,\n\n1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.460\n just even small tweaks in those can fix a lot.\n\n1:11:35.460 --> 1:11:36.300\n Really?\n\n1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:37.140\n I believe so.\n\n1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:39.300\n So like a lot, a lot of the stuff we see now\n\n1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:41.940\n is the result of just initial implementations\n\n1:11:41.940 --> 1:11:44.700\n of these systems that we didn't anticipate.\n\n1:11:44.700 --> 1:11:49.220\n So the modernization comes from engagement\n\n1:11:49.220 --> 1:11:54.060\n and the tools we have is clicking like and sharing.\n\n1:11:54.060 --> 1:11:55.740\n It was not always obvious.\n\n1:11:55.740 --> 1:11:57.180\n It was not obvious from the beginning.\n\n1:11:57.180 --> 1:12:00.180\n It wasn't obvious while Twitter and Facebook grew\n\n1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:01.860\n that there's a big dopamine rush\n\n1:12:01.860 --> 1:12:05.180\n from getting more followers and likes and shares.\n\n1:12:05.180 --> 1:12:06.980\n So we've gotten addicted to this feeling\n\n1:12:06.980 --> 1:12:08.300\n like how many people are commenting,\n\n1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:12.100\n how many people are saying, like clicking like and so on.\n\n1:12:12.100 --> 1:12:13.420\n So that's that dopamine rush.\n\n1:12:13.420 --> 1:12:16.340\n So we want to say the thing that will get the most likes\n\n1:12:16.340 --> 1:12:19.900\n and like unmasked in society.\n\n1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:22.140\n And then the other thing that was expected\n\n1:12:22.140 --> 1:12:25.780\n is the controversial, the divisive will get the most likes.\n\n1:12:25.780 --> 1:12:28.780\n So it had to do with the initial mechanisms\n\n1:12:28.780 --> 1:12:32.020\n of likes and shares resulting in an outcome\n\n1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:35.740\n that was unpredicted, which is huge amounts of division\n\n1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:40.740\n irrespective of like any of the basics of human connection\n\n1:12:41.380 --> 1:12:43.380\n that we've actually all come to understand\n\n1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:46.500\n that society is valuable at the individual level\n\n1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.900\n like we're saying, but unmasked what results\n\n1:12:49.900 --> 1:12:51.460\n is like you throw all that out\n\n1:12:51.460 --> 1:12:55.620\n and it's all just divisive at scale discourse.\n\n1:12:57.820 --> 1:13:02.100\n I think it could be fixed by incentivizing personal growth\n\n1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:05.380\n like incentivizing you to challenge yourself\n\n1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:08.780\n to grows individual and most importantly\n\n1:13:08.780 --> 1:13:11.460\n to be happy at the end of the day.\n\n1:13:11.460 --> 1:13:16.460\n So like incentivize you feeling good\n\n1:13:16.460 --> 1:13:21.460\n in a way that's long lasting longterm.\n\n1:13:21.820 --> 1:13:24.260\n I think what makes people actually feel good\n\n1:13:24.260 --> 1:13:27.540\n is being kind to others longterm.\n\n1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:31.260\n In the short term what feels good is getting a lot of likes.\n\n1:13:31.260 --> 1:13:34.660\n And I think those are just different incentives\n\n1:13:34.660 --> 1:13:36.540\n that if implemented correctly\n\n1:13:36.540 --> 1:13:37.960\n you can just build social networks\n\n1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:38.900\n that would do much better.\n\n1:13:38.900 --> 1:13:41.060\n So do you think it comes from a structural perspective?\n\n1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:42.820\n I guess at what point does you mention like\n\n1:13:42.820 --> 1:13:44.820\n you mentioned free will and also you mentioned\n\n1:13:44.820 --> 1:13:47.460\n feeling good and again working hard.\n\n1:13:47.460 --> 1:13:51.700\n I know that you have the, I guess the, was it a race or?\n\n1:13:51.700 --> 1:13:54.420\n No, it's the Goggins thing.\n\n1:13:54.420 --> 1:13:57.460\n It's four by four by 48 challenge\n\n1:13:57.460 --> 1:14:00.620\n where you run four miles every four hours for two days.\n\n1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:01.460\n That's awesome.\n\n1:14:01.460 --> 1:14:05.740\n Yeah, it's a bunch of, the challenge of it\n\n1:14:05.740 --> 1:14:07.780\n isn't just the running, the running is very tough\n\n1:14:07.780 --> 1:14:09.860\n but it's mostly the sleep deprivation\n\n1:14:09.860 --> 1:14:11.780\n because you're just training every four hours.\n\n1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:13.340\n But it's a struggle, right?\n\n1:14:13.340 --> 1:14:14.860\n But the struggle gives meaning.\n\n1:14:14.860 --> 1:14:17.540\n And ultimately I guess so how can we,\n\n1:14:17.540 --> 1:14:19.260\n because you mentioned like you said adjusting things\n\n1:14:19.260 --> 1:14:22.940\n on like a, I guess like a programming level almost,\n\n1:14:22.940 --> 1:14:24.620\n based programming level so that the interface\n\n1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:25.740\n is different for the user.\n\n1:14:25.740 --> 1:14:28.620\n But at what point does the user have a responsibility\n\n1:14:28.620 --> 1:14:31.400\n to as a man or a woman or a person\n\n1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:34.300\n to just behave more decently?\n\n1:14:34.300 --> 1:14:37.420\n How can we I guess utilize, what can we do?\n\n1:14:37.420 --> 1:14:40.960\n It seems like our society is so grossly missing\n\n1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.360\n like a Martin Luther King right now,\n\n1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:44.540\n like the great inspiring characters\n\n1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:46.940\n throughout American history, throughout world history.\n\n1:14:46.940 --> 1:14:48.540\n Where are the great leaders?\n\n1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:51.800\n So leadership is part of it, but that's definitely,\n\n1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.740\n where are the great leaders is a very good question.\n\n1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:56.780\n That's more of a question of our political systems\n\n1:14:56.780 --> 1:14:58.940\n why they're not pushing forward the great leaders.\n\n1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:02.780\n But there's also just, okay,\n\n1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:05.460\n there's some just basic engineering shit\n\n1:15:05.460 --> 1:15:10.020\n which is when you and I, when you Ryan and I\n\n1:15:10.020 --> 1:15:13.100\n are in a room alone and we're talking,\n\n1:15:13.100 --> 1:15:15.660\n even if we're strangers, the incentives\n\n1:15:15.660 --> 1:15:17.780\n are for us to get along.\n\n1:15:17.780 --> 1:15:20.420\n Like just when we're together in person,\n\n1:15:20.420 --> 1:15:21.260\n that's what I'm saying.\n\n1:15:21.260 --> 1:15:22.700\n I'm not even saying some kind of profound.\n\n1:15:22.700 --> 1:15:23.780\n But when you remove that.\n\n1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:26.700\n When we remove that, the implementation\n\n1:15:26.700 --> 1:15:30.500\n of social networks as they stand right now\n\n1:15:30.500 --> 1:15:33.920\n in the digital space, a very different set of incentives.\n\n1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:38.100\n It's more fun to destroy others, to be shitty to others.\n\n1:15:38.100 --> 1:15:43.100\n And it becomes this endless loop, like you were saying,\n\n1:15:43.620 --> 1:15:45.720\n that's ultimately destructive and not productive.\n\n1:15:45.720 --> 1:15:49.480\n And I think it has to do with just the interfaces\n\n1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:54.420\n of making it feel good to be nice to others.\n\n1:15:54.420 --> 1:15:58.220\n Because currently it doesn't feel nearly as good\n\n1:15:58.220 --> 1:16:01.060\n to be nice to others on the internet.\n\n1:16:01.060 --> 1:16:05.800\n And it doesn't feel nearly as bad as it does in real life\n\n1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:07.520\n to be shitty to others on the internet.\n\n1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:09.380\n So the incentives are just wrong.\n\n1:16:09.380 --> 1:16:13.300\n I think there is a technology solution to this,\n\n1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:15.820\n or at least a solution to improve\n\n1:16:15.820 --> 1:16:17.820\n this communication mechanism.\n\n1:16:17.820 --> 1:16:19.020\n It's not obvious how.\n\n1:16:19.020 --> 1:16:20.780\n I have a bunch of sort of more detailed ideas,\n\n1:16:20.780 --> 1:16:24.540\n but this is fascinating because I've gotten a chance\n\n1:16:24.540 --> 1:16:26.260\n to talk to Jack Dorsey quite a bit.\n\n1:16:26.260 --> 1:16:27.820\n He's the CEO of Twitter.\n\n1:16:27.820 --> 1:16:32.820\n And he is legitimately has, in this conversation,\n\n1:16:34.340 --> 1:16:35.780\n he would agree with everything.\n\n1:16:35.780 --> 1:16:38.620\n And he's a good human being,\n\n1:16:38.620 --> 1:16:41.140\n and he has a lot of really good ideas how to improve things.\n\n1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:44.220\n The question when you're a captain of a ship,\n\n1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:48.020\n whether it's a question whether a CEO is even a captain,\n\n1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:49.960\n how much can you actually steer that ship\n\n1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:51.380\n once it's gotten large enough?\n\n1:16:51.380 --> 1:16:53.440\n There's so much momentum, there's so many users,\n\n1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.140\n there's so many people who are marketing and PR and lawyers.\n\n1:16:57.140 --> 1:16:59.220\n It's very difficult to change things.\n\n1:16:59.220 --> 1:17:01.740\n Is it difficult because of the fallout,\n\n1:17:01.740 --> 1:17:03.220\n or is it difficult because it's actually\n\n1:17:03.220 --> 1:17:05.860\n like literally out of this power?\n\n1:17:05.860 --> 1:17:09.260\n So power is weird when you have a large organization.\n\n1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:11.340\n This is why the great leaders,\n\n1:17:11.340 --> 1:17:12.780\n this is what great leaders do,\n\n1:17:12.780 --> 1:17:15.500\n whether it's presidents or leaders of companies.\n\n1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:18.420\n Steve Jobs, I would argue Musk is that way,\n\n1:17:18.420 --> 1:17:20.740\n is to walk into a room full of people\n\n1:17:20.740 --> 1:17:23.220\n who don't want you to create drama.\n\n1:17:23.220 --> 1:17:24.980\n It's weird, man.\n\n1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:27.420\n When people just kind of want to be nice,\n\n1:17:28.460 --> 1:17:32.140\n the niceness creates momentum and nobody wants to,\n\n1:17:32.140 --> 1:17:33.260\n it's the systems thing.\n\n1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:34.660\n Everybody just behaves in the way\n\n1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:36.600\n they were previously behaving\n\n1:17:36.600 --> 1:17:38.660\n in the way they're supposed to behave,\n\n1:17:38.660 --> 1:17:40.760\n and nobody wants to raise a fuss.\n\n1:17:40.760 --> 1:17:45.300\n It takes a great man or woman leader to step in and say,\n\n1:17:45.300 --> 1:17:48.380\n what we've been doing is bullshit.\n\n1:17:48.380 --> 1:17:50.780\n Okay, you're fired, you're cool.\n\n1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:51.820\n What is it that?\n\n1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:53.140\n I'm out.\n\n1:17:53.140 --> 1:17:56.920\n I think you have to create constant revolutions\n\n1:17:56.920 --> 1:17:59.780\n within a company that's very, very difficult to do.\n\n1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:03.020\n Structurally and psychologically, it's very difficult to do,\n\n1:18:03.020 --> 1:18:05.860\n to be able to sort of, yeah,\n\n1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:08.420\n to constantly challenge the way things have been done\n\n1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:13.300\n in the past, which is why another way it's often done\n\n1:18:13.300 --> 1:18:15.380\n is a startup, like a small company,\n\n1:18:15.380 --> 1:18:18.300\n basically a small company becomes really successful\n\n1:18:18.300 --> 1:18:20.660\n and then no longer can turn the ship,\n\n1:18:20.660 --> 1:18:23.540\n so a new startup comes along, a new competitor\n\n1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:25.460\n that then challenges the big ship,\n\n1:18:25.460 --> 1:18:27.180\n and then that starts out the winner.\n\n1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:28.980\n That's like Google came to be,\n\n1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:31.920\n so Twitter came to be, and Facebook, and so on.\n\n1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:36.780\n And Apple has, that was the dream of Steve Jobs\n\n1:18:36.780 --> 1:18:40.820\n is it would succeed for many decades, for like centuries.\n\n1:18:40.820 --> 1:18:44.460\n That was the idea that you would keep creating revolutions,\n\n1:18:44.460 --> 1:18:48.660\n and under Steve Jobs, Apple successfully pivoted\n\n1:18:48.660 --> 1:18:51.640\n a bunch of times, just like reinvented themselves,\n\n1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:53.340\n which is very difficult to do.\n\n1:18:53.340 --> 1:18:54.780\n Because I mean, I've heard, at least I don't know\n\n1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:56.320\n if this is accurate, because I wouldn't know anything,\n\n1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:58.900\n but I've heard plenty of people complain about Steve Jobs.\n\n1:18:58.900 --> 1:18:59.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:03.100\n But in reality, the reason that all of these amazing things\n\n1:19:03.100 --> 1:19:05.220\n were done was because this person was willing to,\n\n1:19:05.220 --> 1:19:06.640\n well obviously brilliant, and then also willing\n\n1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:09.840\n to rattle everyone's cage periodically\n\n1:19:09.840 --> 1:19:12.140\n and say, hey, what's going on is not what we need\n\n1:19:12.140 --> 1:19:13.140\n to be doing.\n\n1:19:13.140 --> 1:19:14.380\n That's a really interesting thing.\n\n1:19:14.380 --> 1:19:17.740\n So he would rattle the cage, but he would also,\n\n1:19:17.740 --> 1:19:20.980\n I don't know if those are intricately connected\n\n1:19:20.980 --> 1:19:22.300\n or always have to be connected,\n\n1:19:22.300 --> 1:19:23.740\n but he would just be a dick.\n\n1:19:24.580 --> 1:19:28.420\n So maybe by his standard, I am lazy and worthless.\n\n1:19:28.420 --> 1:19:29.860\n Well, he would say that to you, right?\n\n1:19:29.860 --> 1:19:32.060\n Is he being a dick though, if by his standard,\n\n1:19:32.060 --> 1:19:33.680\n I mean, again, it's like everyone's stupid\n\n1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:34.960\n compared to somebody.\n\n1:19:34.960 --> 1:19:36.220\n You know, I guess.\n\n1:19:36.220 --> 1:19:39.820\n But, so you apparently are able to take that kind of thing.\n\n1:19:41.460 --> 1:19:46.460\n Sometimes you just, there's ways to cross the line.\n\n1:19:46.620 --> 1:19:49.820\n And I mean, this is, okay, the fascinating thing\n\n1:19:49.820 --> 1:19:53.580\n about being a leader, especially a leader of companies,\n\n1:19:53.580 --> 1:19:55.520\n is it's a people problem.\n\n1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:59.140\n So each individual in a room, so as a leader,\n\n1:19:59.140 --> 1:20:01.380\n you're only really interacting with a small number\n\n1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:02.540\n of people because there are leaders\n\n1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:04.400\n of other smaller groups and so on.\n\n1:20:04.400 --> 1:20:07.220\n But each of those individuals in the room\n\n1:20:07.220 --> 1:20:09.580\n have their own different psychology.\n\n1:20:09.580 --> 1:20:11.260\n Some like to be pushed to the limit.\n\n1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:14.580\n Some like to be screamed at.\n\n1:20:14.580 --> 1:20:18.900\n Some are very soft spoken and almost afraid to speak.\n\n1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:23.900\n And they have to be, you have to hear them out.\n\n1:20:23.900 --> 1:20:27.380\n Like there's a, and those could be all superstars.\n\n1:20:27.380 --> 1:20:29.460\n We're not talking about like the C students.\n\n1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:31.080\n We're talking about the A plus students.\n\n1:20:31.080 --> 1:20:32.980\n Well, it's funny that, yeah, but the thing to,\n\n1:20:32.980 --> 1:20:34.700\n the skill to manage all of those people\n\n1:20:34.700 --> 1:20:37.900\n is completely separate from the skill to innovate something.\n\n1:20:37.900 --> 1:20:39.160\n I mean, not that they're not connected,\n\n1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:41.380\n but it's funny how it's, it's almost like, you know,\n\n1:20:41.380 --> 1:20:44.340\n why do we have shitty representatives?\n\n1:20:44.340 --> 1:20:46.700\n Well, I mean, the thing that you do to get elected\n\n1:20:46.700 --> 1:20:48.100\n has nothing to do with governance.\n\n1:20:48.100 --> 1:20:49.180\n Yes.\n\n1:20:49.180 --> 1:20:50.020\n Well, that's exactly it.\n\n1:20:50.020 --> 1:20:52.740\n But the great leaders have to have both skills.\n\n1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:55.180\n So like you have to have the boldness of,\n\n1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:59.540\n if you look at the great presidents through history,\n\n1:20:59.540 --> 1:21:03.140\n usually it's in a time of crisis is when they step up,\n\n1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:07.500\n but they basically say, okay, stop this old way\n\n1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:10.340\n that Congress works of this bickering,\n\n1:21:10.340 --> 1:21:12.420\n of this like compromise bullshit.\n\n1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:15.260\n Here's a huge plan that costs billions of dollars\n\n1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:18.140\n in today's age, trillions of dollars,\n\n1:21:18.140 --> 1:21:20.320\n no extra pork, no extra additions,\n\n1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:22.820\n just like, here's a clear plan.\n\n1:21:22.820 --> 1:21:26.280\n We're going to build the best road network\n\n1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:27.660\n the world has ever seen.\n\n1:21:27.660 --> 1:21:30.040\n We're going to build some huge infrastructure project.\n\n1:21:30.040 --> 1:21:32.240\n We're going to revolutionize internet.\n\n1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:34.600\n Oh, we're going to, for coronavirus,\n\n1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:36.940\n we're going to build the largest like testing facility\n\n1:21:36.940 --> 1:21:38.820\n the world has ever seen in terms of the,\n\n1:21:38.820 --> 1:21:42.160\n we're gonna get everybody tested several times a day,\n\n1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:45.300\n all those kinds of things, huge projects and say,\n\n1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:48.980\n fuck all this, the details that everybody's bickering about,\n\n1:21:48.980 --> 1:21:51.460\n we're going to give everybody $2,000,\n\n1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:54.740\n we can give everybody $3,000, like huge projects.\n\n1:21:54.740 --> 1:21:56.740\n And at the same time, so that's the boldness\n\n1:21:56.740 --> 1:21:58.020\n and the leadership and saying,\n\n1:21:58.020 --> 1:22:01.180\n throw out all the bullshit of the past.\n\n1:22:01.180 --> 1:22:04.880\n And at the same time, be able to get in the room\n\n1:22:04.880 --> 1:22:06.360\n with the leaders of both parties\n\n1:22:06.360 --> 1:22:08.380\n or for the powerful individuals\n\n1:22:08.380 --> 1:22:10.420\n and smooth talk the shit out of them\n\n1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:12.580\n in the way they need to be smooth talked to.\n\n1:22:12.580 --> 1:22:14.500\n So like both of those skills,\n\n1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:16.460\n it seems to be when they're combining one person,\n\n1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:19.060\n that creates great leaders.\n\n1:22:19.060 --> 1:22:21.080\n Musk appears to have that, Elon.\n\n1:22:21.940 --> 1:22:25.420\n I don't know if Steve Jobs, it's interesting.\n\n1:22:25.420 --> 1:22:28.180\n So the criticism of Steve and a little bit on Elon\n\n1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:31.620\n is he misses some of the human part,\n\n1:22:31.620 --> 1:22:35.200\n but maybe it's impossible to have a really,\n\n1:22:35.200 --> 1:22:37.980\n you have like Sadia Nadal, who's the CEO of Microsoft,\n\n1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:41.580\n you have, who's really good on the human side,\n\n1:22:41.580 --> 1:22:43.020\n really, really good on the human side,\n\n1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:44.860\n like everybody loves him.\n\n1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:49.260\n The CEO of Google and Alphabet is also the same way.\n\n1:22:49.260 --> 1:22:51.860\n So like, I don't know if it's possible to have both.\n\n1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:54.860\n You only get so many stat points.\n\n1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:59.340\n Yeah, you only get, in this RPG of life, yeah.\n\n1:22:59.340 --> 1:23:02.420\n You got very good at jujitsu very fast.\n\n1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:05.540\n So you went, I mean, you told the story of Blue Belt\n\n1:23:05.540 --> 1:23:09.180\n and so on, but you went to Black Belt really quickly\n\n1:23:09.180 --> 1:23:10.740\n and not just in terms of ranks,\n\n1:23:10.740 --> 1:23:12.760\n but in terms of just skill level.\n\n1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:15.740\n I mean, you didn't go to Black Belt nearly as fast\n\n1:23:15.740 --> 1:23:17.900\n as your skill set developed.\n\n1:23:17.900 --> 1:23:19.660\n You were like doing extremely well\n\n1:23:19.660 --> 1:23:21.520\n at a high level of competition.\n\n1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:24.220\n So you're a good person to ask,\n\n1:23:24.220 --> 1:23:26.700\n how does one get good at jujitsu?\n\n1:23:26.700 --> 1:23:29.160\n We talked about solving problems at the elite level,\n\n1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:33.300\n but when you're a beginner at the martial arts,\n\n1:23:33.300 --> 1:23:34.740\n how do you get good?\n\n1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:36.420\n How much training should you do?\n\n1:23:36.420 --> 1:23:38.460\n The very basic stuff, like how much training,\n\n1:23:38.460 --> 1:23:40.980\n how much drilling, and then the mental stuff,\n\n1:23:40.980 --> 1:23:44.980\n like where should your mind be?\n\n1:23:44.980 --> 1:23:48.220\n How should you approach it from a mental perspective too?\n\n1:23:48.220 --> 1:23:49.820\n I'll just tell you my perspective on this one.\n\n1:23:49.820 --> 1:23:52.340\n I guess I would say I feel step one,\n\n1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:56.400\n I feel lucky to have found a good training situation,\n\n1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:01.320\n particularly for the time in where I was at.\n\n1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:04.060\n And I drilled a ton.\n\n1:24:04.060 --> 1:24:06.660\n I drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled and drilled.\n\n1:24:06.660 --> 1:24:10.420\n And one thing that's really important to understand though,\n\n1:24:10.420 --> 1:24:15.420\n is that I was able to, in a relatively brief period of years,\n\n1:24:15.820 --> 1:24:18.140\n go from zero to reasonably good.\n\n1:24:18.140 --> 1:24:21.740\n But I think I probably crammed more hours\n\n1:24:21.740 --> 1:24:26.620\n in those small years than most people did training,\n\n1:24:26.620 --> 1:24:28.560\n let's say in two or three times the length.\n\n1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:32.540\n So it may masquerade as something else other than it is.\n\n1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:33.380\n I could say.\n\n1:24:33.380 --> 1:24:34.540\n So you have to put in the hours.\n\n1:24:34.540 --> 1:24:35.380\n Yeah.\n\n1:24:35.380 --> 1:24:36.200\n There's no way around that.\n\n1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:37.040\n I think so.\n\n1:24:37.040 --> 1:24:38.020\n But what did you put in those hours?\n\n1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:40.500\n So when you say drilling, can you break that apart\n\n1:24:40.500 --> 1:24:41.340\n a little bit?\n\n1:24:41.340 --> 1:24:42.160\n Sure.\n\n1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.000\n What does drilling look like?\n\n1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:44.040\n Is there any recommendations you can put in?\n\n1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:44.880\n Absolutely.\n\n1:24:44.880 --> 1:24:47.300\n Step one, I would say your choices matter.\n\n1:24:47.300 --> 1:24:49.080\n I think one of the really important things\n\n1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:50.900\n that I think we should consider about jiu jitsu\n\n1:24:50.900 --> 1:24:52.740\n is that there's a lot of junk in the system right now.\n\n1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:56.180\n It's like jiu jitsu has exploded in terms of\n\n1:24:56.180 --> 1:24:58.320\n the number of positions, techniques, strategies,\n\n1:24:58.320 --> 1:24:59.980\n this, that, rule sets.\n\n1:24:59.980 --> 1:25:01.500\n That's really cool on the one hand.\n\n1:25:01.500 --> 1:25:05.860\n On the other hand, there's probably a just metric shit ton\n\n1:25:05.860 --> 1:25:08.620\n of suboptimal things that are out there\n\n1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:09.720\n that are being taught.\n\n1:25:11.060 --> 1:25:13.260\n Myself included, I've taught things that are looking back\n\n1:25:13.260 --> 1:25:14.780\n five years, three years, two years, one year,\n\n1:25:14.780 --> 1:25:16.900\n where I'm like, oh, I would not do it like that anymore.\n\n1:25:16.900 --> 1:25:18.460\n Straight up, sometimes I wouldn't do it like that.\n\n1:25:18.460 --> 1:25:20.460\n Other times I would literally never do\n\n1:25:20.460 --> 1:25:22.760\n even that particular movement.\n\n1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:25.460\n I don't think the shrimp is a real move.\n\n1:25:25.460 --> 1:25:28.820\n It's a giant spiel and seizure to show in person.\n\n1:25:28.820 --> 1:25:30.260\n But long story short, there's a lot of things\n\n1:25:30.260 --> 1:25:32.020\n that we think of as fundamental\n\n1:25:32.020 --> 1:25:35.320\n that I think that are really pretty negative.\n\n1:25:35.320 --> 1:25:36.700\n And also, you know.\n\n1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:37.980\n That's heresy in jiu jitsu.\n\n1:25:37.980 --> 1:25:38.820\n Isn't it?\n\n1:25:38.820 --> 1:25:39.640\n The shrimp.\n\n1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:40.480\n Exactly.\n\n1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:42.500\n Is like the holy, we all worship the shrimp.\n\n1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:43.540\n We love the shrimp.\n\n1:25:43.540 --> 1:25:45.020\n We love the shrimp.\n\n1:25:45.020 --> 1:25:47.900\n For people who don't do jiu jitsu, and you should,\n\n1:25:47.900 --> 1:25:52.900\n the shrimp is you scoot your butt away from your opponent.\n\n1:25:53.940 --> 1:25:56.780\n Yeah, in a really, it's like a really athletic\n\n1:25:56.780 --> 1:25:58.980\n looking position where you look like someone\n\n1:25:58.980 --> 1:26:00.980\n that's trying to stick their butt out on Instagram,\n\n1:26:00.980 --> 1:26:02.380\n and then you push your hands away,\n\n1:26:02.380 --> 1:26:04.180\n and you expose your face,\n\n1:26:04.180 --> 1:26:05.980\n and then you lay on your side\n\n1:26:05.980 --> 1:26:08.440\n because someone told you to do that.\n\n1:26:09.380 --> 1:26:12.720\n And you look like a, I guess you look like a shrimp.\n\n1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:15.600\n Yeah, it's like that time that someone really credible\n\n1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:17.100\n told me to drink unleaded gasoline,\n\n1:26:17.100 --> 1:26:18.260\n and I did it for a while.\n\n1:26:18.260 --> 1:26:20.420\n And then it got to the point in my life\n\n1:26:20.420 --> 1:26:22.620\n where the next best, the thing that I needed to do\n\n1:26:22.620 --> 1:26:24.740\n to really improve my life was stop drinking\n\n1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:26.500\n unleaded gasoline.\n\n1:26:26.500 --> 1:26:29.000\n And I would say that there's a lot of stuff\n\n1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:33.060\n that's in there that step one is like it's junk.\n\n1:26:33.060 --> 1:26:34.140\n It's actual junk.\n\n1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:37.600\n And it's not only will it waste your time,\n\n1:26:37.600 --> 1:26:41.020\n it will straight up, it will be like an albatross\n\n1:26:41.020 --> 1:26:43.580\n hanging on you because it affects how you think\n\n1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:44.620\n about things going forward.\n\n1:26:44.620 --> 1:26:47.900\n So although it was, it's funny,\n\n1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:50.820\n like the operating assumptions that we work under\n\n1:26:51.820 --> 1:26:53.580\n have a huge, huge, huge influence.\n\n1:26:53.580 --> 1:26:55.240\n You mentioned like growing up in the United States\n\n1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.140\n or this being a capitalist society, like woo, all right.\n\n1:26:58.140 --> 1:26:59.140\n Now, of course I think that,\n\n1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:00.860\n I don't really know any different otherwise.\n\n1:27:00.860 --> 1:27:02.300\n And I think that a lot of times people go,\n\n1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:03.560\n oh, communism is better.\n\n1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:04.940\n I'm like, haven't seen it.\n\n1:27:04.940 --> 1:27:06.780\n I haven't read any books about it being better,\n\n1:27:06.780 --> 1:27:08.020\n but it's possible.\n\n1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.660\n I mean, I haven't experienced it much myself either.\n\n1:27:10.660 --> 1:27:12.500\n So I can't dismiss it outright,\n\n1:27:12.500 --> 1:27:14.300\n but I guess I would say it's a fundamentally\n\n1:27:14.300 --> 1:27:17.140\n different operating system underpinning\n\n1:27:17.140 --> 1:27:18.940\n and all of my choices, all of,\n\n1:27:18.940 --> 1:27:21.320\n if I honestly believed in that thing,\n\n1:27:21.320 --> 1:27:23.740\n many of my choices on a moment by moment,\n\n1:27:23.740 --> 1:27:26.100\n on a day by day, and certainly on a lifetime basis\n\n1:27:26.100 --> 1:27:27.100\n would be very different.\n\n1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:31.020\n So I would say that it's tough when you're young\n\n1:27:31.020 --> 1:27:32.020\n in the martial arts.\n\n1:27:32.020 --> 1:27:33.300\n And I mean, all of us are always trying to do\n\n1:27:33.300 --> 1:27:34.140\n our best to learn.\n\n1:27:34.140 --> 1:27:35.260\n But when you're young in the martial arts,\n\n1:27:35.260 --> 1:27:37.020\n you always go, if you're a reasonable guy,\n\n1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:37.860\n what do they, what do they call it?\n\n1:27:37.860 --> 1:27:38.740\n Like Dunning, Kruger, Amnesia.\n\n1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:39.620\n I can't remember if this is the right one,\n\n1:27:39.620 --> 1:27:42.820\n but basically you go like, oh, I know what I'm doing here.\n\n1:27:42.820 --> 1:27:44.080\n So I can say that's not right.\n\n1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:46.340\n But then I read a news story about baseball\n\n1:27:46.340 --> 1:27:48.120\n and I don't know anything about baseball, sounds credible.\n\n1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:50.980\n And it's bullshit, but I can't call bullshit.\n\n1:27:50.980 --> 1:27:51.820\n If you're a reasonable person,\n\n1:27:51.820 --> 1:27:53.460\n you can't call bullshit on things that you don't understand.\n\n1:27:53.460 --> 1:27:54.840\n Even if you suspect it's not right,\n\n1:27:54.840 --> 1:27:56.980\n you're like, well, I've got to reserve judgment.\n\n1:27:56.980 --> 1:28:01.340\n You never, ever, ever set aside your need\n\n1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:04.220\n and also obligation to understand why you were doing\n\n1:28:04.220 --> 1:28:05.060\n what you're doing.\n\n1:28:05.060 --> 1:28:07.900\n And don't ask why once, ask why over and over and over\n\n1:28:07.900 --> 1:28:09.380\n and over about the same thing.\n\n1:28:09.380 --> 1:28:10.500\n Oh, well, I want a shrimp.\n\n1:28:10.500 --> 1:28:11.340\n Why?\n\n1:28:11.340 --> 1:28:12.160\n To make space.\n\n1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.000\n Why do I want to make space?\n\n1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:13.840\n To get away from the guy.\n\n1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:15.100\n Well, why do I want to get away from him?\n\n1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:16.060\n Well, because he's dangerous.\n\n1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:16.980\n Well, why is he dangerous?\n\n1:28:16.980 --> 1:28:18.740\n And you can oftentimes get down to, wait a minute,\n\n1:28:18.740 --> 1:28:20.060\n I didn't even need to move.\n\n1:28:20.060 --> 1:28:20.880\n Three quarters of the time,\n\n1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:23.060\n you're actually acting in the other person's self interest.\n\n1:28:23.060 --> 1:28:24.300\n And I guess a lot of times I can't,\n\n1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:27.380\n this kind of goes beyond what we can demonstrate here.\n\n1:28:27.380 --> 1:28:29.940\n But I would just say trying to understand\n\n1:28:29.940 --> 1:28:31.860\n what my base operating assumptions are\n\n1:28:31.860 --> 1:28:33.520\n and consistently reevaluate them,\n\n1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:35.260\n which can be fricking exhausting, frankly,\n\n1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:37.340\n and also constantly confidence destroying.\n\n1:28:37.340 --> 1:28:39.740\n But you mentioned that I did pretty well\n\n1:28:39.740 --> 1:28:40.780\n relatively quickly.\n\n1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:45.500\n I started in 2004 and I was at Abu Dhabi ADCC\n\n1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.580\n for the first time as an alternate in 2007.\n\n1:28:48.580 --> 1:28:51.660\n I won a match there against a Black Belt world champion.\n\n1:28:51.660 --> 1:28:53.760\n And the fact, frankly, the fact that I was able\n\n1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:55.260\n to beat someone like that was neat,\n\n1:28:55.260 --> 1:28:56.740\n but at the same time says a little bit more\n\n1:28:56.740 --> 1:29:01.040\n about what jiu jitsu is and some of the issues with it\n\n1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:03.620\n than it does about how cool I am or was,\n\n1:29:03.620 --> 1:29:08.340\n because that shouldn't really happen\n\n1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:09.180\n when you think about it.\n\n1:29:09.180 --> 1:29:12.100\n You're like, okay, you're a champion at ostensibly\n\n1:29:12.100 --> 1:29:14.240\n a very high level of the sport.\n\n1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:17.880\n You enjoy a three inch, four inch height advantage\n\n1:29:17.880 --> 1:29:21.300\n and a 35 pound weight advantage, and you just got beat.\n\n1:29:21.300 --> 1:29:23.980\n Like that should not, I'm dead serious,\n\n1:29:23.980 --> 1:29:24.900\n that should not exist.\n\n1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:26.400\n If that happens, you're doing it wrong.\n\n1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:27.580\n Is it that I'm doing it right?\n\n1:29:27.580 --> 1:29:28.740\n Or is it that you're doing it wrong\n\n1:29:28.740 --> 1:29:31.940\n and there's enough variance in the way that you're doing it\n\n1:29:31.940 --> 1:29:34.220\n that you're allowing me to win?\n\n1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:36.460\n And now I did happen to win that with the 50, 50 heel hook,\n\n1:29:36.460 --> 1:29:40.340\n which was 50, 50, but basically,\n\n1:29:40.340 --> 1:29:42.380\n which was one of the early examples of like,\n\n1:29:42.380 --> 1:29:45.540\n hey guys, by the way, people can try to hurt your legs.\n\n1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:47.540\n And that was something like, we mentioned John Danaher,\n\n1:29:47.540 --> 1:29:49.640\n mentioned like, you know, myself, Dean Lister,\n\n1:29:49.640 --> 1:29:51.140\n a lot of the guys from the Henzo Gracie team\n\n1:29:51.140 --> 1:29:52.380\n that have had amazing success.\n\n1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:54.380\n They've gone and done great things.\n\n1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:57.020\n And you know, Craig Jones in the competitive grappling world,\n\n1:29:57.020 --> 1:29:59.540\n basically taking advantage of being very, very good\n\n1:29:59.540 --> 1:30:02.080\n in what they're doing, but also a glaring, glaring,\n\n1:30:02.080 --> 1:30:04.760\n glaring issue with the operating system of jiu jitsu,\n\n1:30:04.760 --> 1:30:08.460\n which was, you know, a huge vulnerability in the lower body\n\n1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:09.980\n and not only not attacking it,\n\n1:30:09.980 --> 1:30:12.300\n but having no idea how one does attack it,\n\n1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:13.300\n which means you can't understand\n\n1:30:13.300 --> 1:30:15.020\n how someone will assail you.\n\n1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:20.020\n So anyway, I guess to come back is if in the absence\n\n1:30:20.140 --> 1:30:22.540\n of knowing what to do, I try to polish what I've got.\n\n1:30:22.540 --> 1:30:23.580\n So if I've got a knife and I'm like,\n\n1:30:23.580 --> 1:30:24.420\n I don't know how to use them,\n\n1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:25.580\n I'm like, okay, I'm just gonna sharpen the edge\n\n1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:27.060\n and polish it and make sure that when I need\n\n1:30:27.060 --> 1:30:29.240\n to use this dang thing, I'll be able to do it.\n\n1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.740\n Because trying to put together a system\n\n1:30:31.740 --> 1:30:34.260\n when you don't have an idea of what's going on,\n\n1:30:34.260 --> 1:30:37.260\n a lot of times you end up making suboptimal choices,\n\n1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:39.300\n but as long as you're consistently reevaluating\n\n1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:40.580\n what you're doing, and that's something I've tried\n\n1:30:40.580 --> 1:30:42.660\n to do over time, over and over and over again,\n\n1:30:42.660 --> 1:30:47.060\n and try to seek out the most, the best,\n\n1:30:47.060 --> 1:30:51.900\n and also most articulate or insightful instructors\n\n1:30:51.900 --> 1:30:53.780\n or people of various levels, doesn't matter if they're\n\n1:30:53.780 --> 1:30:55.640\n well known or not, that could say, hey, Ryan,\n\n1:30:55.640 --> 1:30:57.460\n I think you should do this, I think you should do that.\n\n1:30:57.460 --> 1:30:59.940\n And I think all I've ever done in martial arts\n\n1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.280\n is try to treat people with respect, honestly,\n\n1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:05.180\n try to demonstrate appreciation for the many,\n\n1:31:05.180 --> 1:31:06.860\n many people who have helped me over time\n\n1:31:06.860 --> 1:31:09.140\n and be the type of person that they wanna train with.\n\n1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:10.840\n Not the type of, because we've all trained with people\n\n1:31:10.840 --> 1:31:13.980\n that make us think about beating the ever loving crap.\n\n1:31:13.980 --> 1:31:15.220\n I never wanted to be that guy.\n\n1:31:15.220 --> 1:31:16.900\n And I was basically saying like, if I train\n\n1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:18.400\n with a black belt when I'm a blue belt\n\n1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:21.540\n and this person enjoys training with me,\n\n1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:22.380\n that's in my interest.\n\n1:31:22.380 --> 1:31:24.420\n Selfishly, not only do I not want them to beat me up,\n\n1:31:24.420 --> 1:31:26.500\n but selfishly, I should, you mentioned being decent\n\n1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:28.140\n to other people, you wanna incentivize being decent\n\n1:31:28.140 --> 1:31:29.540\n to other people, right, with a structure\n\n1:31:29.540 --> 1:31:30.940\n of what you're doing.\n\n1:31:30.940 --> 1:31:33.700\n Selfishly, I'm incentivized to be a nice guy,\n\n1:31:33.700 --> 1:31:35.540\n even if I'm internally a scumbag,\n\n1:31:35.540 --> 1:31:36.900\n which I like to think that I'm not,\n\n1:31:36.900 --> 1:31:39.580\n but basically going like, hey, this guy's way more likely\n\n1:31:39.580 --> 1:31:41.420\n to help me or this person's way more likely to help me\n\n1:31:41.420 --> 1:31:43.220\n if I shake their hand, say thank you,\n\n1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:44.560\n I really appreciate you helping me out.\n\n1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:47.960\n And that thing that they tap me with four or five times,\n\n1:31:47.960 --> 1:31:49.260\n I'm gonna ask them about it.\n\n1:31:49.260 --> 1:31:50.240\n And then they don't have to tell me,\n\n1:31:50.240 --> 1:31:51.780\n they're under no obligation, but I'll say,\n\n1:31:51.780 --> 1:31:52.940\n and whether they tell me or don't tell me,\n\n1:31:52.940 --> 1:31:54.860\n thank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.\n\n1:31:54.860 --> 1:31:57.300\n And that's it, you know?\n\n1:31:57.300 --> 1:32:00.860\n Okay, so to summarize, the way you brilliantly described,\n\n1:32:00.860 --> 1:32:02.300\n I just wanna make sure we're keeping track of this.\n\n1:32:02.300 --> 1:32:03.540\n I went all over the place.\n\n1:32:03.540 --> 1:32:05.860\n No, you didn't, you're pretty on point.\n\n1:32:05.860 --> 1:32:09.380\n But so the first thing is basically, which is difficult,\n\n1:32:09.380 --> 1:32:11.340\n I wonder if we can break it apart a little bit,\n\n1:32:11.340 --> 1:32:13.620\n is don't trust authority, essentially.\n\n1:32:13.620 --> 1:32:14.780\n Keep asking why.\n\n1:32:14.780 --> 1:32:16.660\n Be respectful without trusting authority, right?\n\n1:32:16.660 --> 1:32:18.300\n Right, which is, and then the second thing\n\n1:32:18.300 --> 1:32:21.540\n is be the kind of person that others like training with\n\n1:32:21.540 --> 1:32:26.540\n or like being around, sort of being a good friend.\n\n1:32:27.220 --> 1:32:28.980\n So so many people just enjoy being around.\n\n1:32:28.980 --> 1:32:31.660\n So one is completely, which is, yeah, you're right,\n\n1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:34.900\n it's attention, which is like completely disrespect\n\n1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:37.940\n the way that things are done.\n\n1:32:37.940 --> 1:32:40.100\n So asking why constantly.\n\n1:32:40.100 --> 1:32:42.660\n One of it is your own flaws and not understanding\n\n1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:44.740\n the fundamentals of what's being described.\n\n1:32:44.740 --> 1:32:46.300\n And then once you get good enough,\n\n1:32:46.300 --> 1:32:51.300\n not understanding, like going against the fact\n\n1:32:51.320 --> 1:32:53.820\n that the instructor doesn't understand.\n\n1:32:53.820 --> 1:32:55.980\n And my inability to understand what you're saying, though,\n\n1:32:55.980 --> 1:32:56.940\n doesn't invalidate it.\n\n1:32:56.940 --> 1:32:58.020\n And that's something like you mentioned,\n\n1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:00.940\n like me mentioning, keeping in mind our own flaws.\n\n1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:02.980\n And then also, again, the flaws that any of us have\n\n1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:04.340\n is the instructor, to your point.\n\n1:33:04.340 --> 1:33:07.020\n And I guess I can speak to being kind of weird.\n\n1:33:07.020 --> 1:33:09.580\n I don't, you know, I like to sit in the corner.\n\n1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:12.060\n But so everyone's a little bit different.\n\n1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:13.980\n Some people, you know, I wasn't terribly popular\n\n1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:14.820\n in high school.\n\n1:33:14.820 --> 1:33:18.220\n You know, like, I didn't like high school very much.\n\n1:33:18.220 --> 1:33:21.340\n But anyway, I would, not gonna be rude to people, though.\n\n1:33:21.340 --> 1:33:22.980\n I was never gonna bully anybody.\n\n1:33:22.980 --> 1:33:24.940\n If you said hello to me, I'd say hello back.\n\n1:33:24.940 --> 1:33:26.780\n I would hold the door for you if you walked by.\n\n1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:29.740\n You know, and I would just say, like simple things like that\n\n1:33:29.740 --> 1:33:31.660\n go a long, long, long way.\n\n1:33:31.660 --> 1:33:35.420\n And that actually takes us back to our social discussion\n\n1:33:35.420 --> 1:33:37.660\n where I'm like, oh man, how do I become great at jiu jitsu?\n\n1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:40.380\n It's like, well, I'll start by not pissing off this person\n\n1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:41.940\n who can beat the crap out of me\n\n1:33:41.940 --> 1:33:45.340\n and not disrespecting the person who is probably\n\n1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:47.780\n the closest thing to a font of knowledge\n\n1:33:47.780 --> 1:33:48.980\n at that time for me.\n\n1:33:48.980 --> 1:33:52.300\n So, and then recognizing that I should do that\n\n1:33:52.300 --> 1:33:54.260\n for its own virtue because it's the right thing to do\n\n1:33:54.260 --> 1:33:55.700\n and I should try to treat people decently.\n\n1:33:55.700 --> 1:33:57.980\n But beyond that, even selfishly,\n\n1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.500\n it's in my interest to do that.\n\n1:33:59.500 --> 1:34:02.460\n But see, the thing is, this is interesting,\n\n1:34:02.460 --> 1:34:06.500\n is there's a culture in martial arts,\n\n1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:08.860\n a culture that I like where the instructor,\n\n1:34:08.860 --> 1:34:13.860\n legitimately so, carries an aura of authority.\n\n1:34:13.980 --> 1:34:18.340\n And it's not comfortable to really ask why.\n\n1:34:18.340 --> 1:34:22.740\n I'm not, it's a skill to be able to have a discussion\n\n1:34:22.740 --> 1:34:26.140\n as a white belt or the black belt instructor\n\n1:34:26.140 --> 1:34:28.500\n of like, why is it done this way?\n\n1:34:29.380 --> 1:34:31.500\n Like, and saying why again.\n\n1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:36.220\n Like, I mean, it's a skill to show that you're actually\n\n1:34:36.220 --> 1:34:40.180\n a legitimately curious and passionate and compassionate\n\n1:34:40.180 --> 1:34:42.500\n student versus like, somebody who's just being\n\n1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:45.220\n an annoying dick who saw some stuff on YouTube.\n\n1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:47.900\n There's a line between, to walk there.\n\n1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:52.420\n I just wonder because like, it's the drilling thing.\n\n1:34:52.420 --> 1:34:57.420\n And, you know, I, for example, like in my,\n\n1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:00.140\n when I was coming out, there was so much emphasis\n\n1:35:00.140 --> 1:35:02.220\n placed on like, close guard, for example.\n\n1:35:03.420 --> 1:35:05.780\n And you might actually teach me now,\n\n1:35:05.780 --> 1:35:08.620\n I don't know, but to me it was like,\n\n1:35:08.620 --> 1:35:12.580\n why do I need to master the close guard?\n\n1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:16.260\n Like, why is the close guard on top or the bottom?\n\n1:35:16.260 --> 1:35:20.260\n But the bottom really, the fundamental basics of jiu jitsu.\n\n1:35:20.260 --> 1:35:21.300\n Who decided that?\n\n1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:25.060\n My body is not, my body says this is wrong.\n\n1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:28.100\n I'm like, this, like I have short legs,\n\n1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:30.220\n but it doesn't even matter the length of the legs.\n\n1:35:30.220 --> 1:35:31.900\n There's something about me that just,\n\n1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:34.360\n I don't understand how leverage here works\n\n1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:37.420\n for my particular body.\n\n1:35:37.420 --> 1:35:40.900\n Like, so it's just, it's a feel thing too.\n\n1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:45.060\n Like, it feels like in my basic understanding\n\n1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:47.980\n of leverage and movement and timing and so on,\n\n1:35:47.980 --> 1:35:50.220\n it feels like these certain, like butterfly guard,\n\n1:35:50.220 --> 1:35:53.180\n or even like half, basically every guard except close guard.\n\n1:35:53.180 --> 1:35:56.260\n I can play, I can dance.\n\n1:35:56.260 --> 1:36:00.780\n Close guard feels like you're shutting down\n\n1:36:02.060 --> 1:36:03.380\n like the play that I.\n\n1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:04.380\n Is that wrong?\n\n1:36:04.380 --> 1:36:06.460\n Or is that, make sure that's what you want\n\n1:36:06.460 --> 1:36:08.660\n because that's almost like an innate characteristic\n\n1:36:08.660 --> 1:36:11.020\n of this guard position, but it's not sold that way, right?\n\n1:36:11.020 --> 1:36:12.860\n It's like, hey, this is a good guard.\n\n1:36:12.860 --> 1:36:16.300\n It's like, hey man, here's a bow and arrow versus,\n\n1:36:16.300 --> 1:36:17.660\n and you know how to use this thing, right?\n\n1:36:17.660 --> 1:36:19.500\n Like make sure you're far away\n\n1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:21.140\n and like up on a hill or something.\n\n1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:22.060\n Cause you can take that bow and arrow,\n\n1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:24.660\n run up on something and try to use it.\n\n1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:27.180\n But if nobody told you not to do that\n\n1:36:27.180 --> 1:36:28.460\n and they told you it was foundational,\n\n1:36:28.460 --> 1:36:29.780\n it's very foundational, it's very important.\n\n1:36:29.780 --> 1:36:31.660\n To everything else too, right?\n\n1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:33.420\n That's back to the shrimping thing.\n\n1:36:33.420 --> 1:36:35.900\n How many things are we taught that even if it's not,\n\n1:36:35.900 --> 1:36:39.180\n let's say itself is not a garbage thing,\n\n1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:42.020\n might be effectively garbage.\n\n1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:43.580\n You could give me a Ferrari,\n\n1:36:43.580 --> 1:36:46.860\n but if I try to make it fly, it's not going to work.\n\n1:36:46.860 --> 1:36:48.820\n If you're like, here's a plane, here's another plane,\n\n1:36:48.820 --> 1:36:50.780\n here's another plane, here's another plane, here's a Ferrari.\n\n1:36:50.780 --> 1:36:52.620\n I'm like, oh, it must be a different type of plane.\n\n1:36:52.620 --> 1:36:55.020\n Like you could be forgiven for leap if we're going there,\n\n1:36:55.020 --> 1:36:56.260\n you know, like, oh, maybe the wings come out\n\n1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:57.940\n or you just go fast enough to take a bullet.\n\n1:36:57.940 --> 1:36:59.740\n You can make these crazy leaps in your mind.\n\n1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:02.540\n And people are doing that all the time.\n\n1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:05.140\n So if you don't provide the context for me,\n\n1:37:05.140 --> 1:37:08.060\n or worse yet, you provide improper context,\n\n1:37:08.060 --> 1:37:10.940\n like how much of a problem is that going to be?\n\n1:37:10.940 --> 1:37:14.340\n Well, I think the skill of the white belt should be,\n\n1:37:14.340 --> 1:37:15.660\n just be nice.\n\n1:37:15.660 --> 1:37:20.300\n But in the complicated human space of when your intention,\n\n1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:23.900\n at least in the big picture view, is good.\n\n1:37:24.980 --> 1:37:28.740\n The question is, it's not always when your intention is good,\n\n1:37:28.740 --> 1:37:32.780\n the actual implementation of it is good.\n\n1:37:32.780 --> 1:37:34.540\n So you might be just almost,\n\n1:37:34.540 --> 1:37:37.300\n and that's much, it's not the case for you,\n\n1:37:37.300 --> 1:37:39.260\n it's much more the case for white belts.\n\n1:37:39.260 --> 1:37:41.620\n They don't even know, their intention might be good,\n\n1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:43.940\n but they don't know all the lines they're crossing,\n\n1:37:43.940 --> 1:37:48.340\n all the, so they're not actually able to like interpret\n\n1:37:48.340 --> 1:37:51.940\n all the ways in which they're being totally insensitive\n\n1:37:51.940 --> 1:37:55.100\n to the requests of others, like explicit requests of others.\n\n1:37:55.100 --> 1:37:59.660\n So your job as a beginner is to be a really good listener\n\n1:37:59.660 --> 1:38:01.260\n of those social cues.\n\n1:38:01.260 --> 1:38:02.900\n Well, it's like a visitor in a foreign country, right?\n\n1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:03.740\n Yeah.\n\n1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:04.820\n Like you're a representative of people\n\n1:38:04.820 --> 1:38:06.660\n that look like you, people that talk like you,\n\n1:38:06.660 --> 1:38:07.940\n people that have your passport,\n\n1:38:07.940 --> 1:38:09.220\n and you're like, man, I'm going to go over here.\n\n1:38:09.220 --> 1:38:10.780\n Oh, I've got my foot up on my knee.\n\n1:38:10.780 --> 1:38:12.020\n Well, if I was in certain countries in the world,\n\n1:38:12.020 --> 1:38:12.980\n that's rude.\n\n1:38:12.980 --> 1:38:14.620\n I'm like, oh, I'm so sorry.\n\n1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:15.740\n But can you imagine if someone says,\n\n1:38:15.740 --> 1:38:17.740\n hey, I really appreciate if you take your foot off,\n\n1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:18.580\n that's pretty rude.\n\n1:38:18.580 --> 1:38:21.380\n And then I want to tell them, well, not where I'm from, man.\n\n1:38:21.380 --> 1:38:22.380\n I'm in your house.\n\n1:38:22.380 --> 1:38:24.660\n I better, again, I might go that direction,\n\n1:38:24.660 --> 1:38:25.860\n but let's say I could get away with that.\n\n1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:27.020\n Now I'm a bully.\n\n1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:28.540\n And if I can't get away with that,\n\n1:38:28.540 --> 1:38:30.820\n well, I'm about to maybe be on the wrong side of something.\n\n1:38:30.820 --> 1:38:33.140\n But I guess, like you said,\n\n1:38:33.140 --> 1:38:34.700\n if we have positive intention, that's fine.\n\n1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:36.020\n But I also have to recognize who I am.\n\n1:38:36.020 --> 1:38:38.980\n And I think that that's one thing that I tried to do\n\n1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:40.820\n and continue to try to do over time.\n\n1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:43.300\n Like we're, oh man, hi,\n\n1:38:43.300 --> 1:38:45.180\n I'm the one that's asking for a favor here.\n\n1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:46.580\n If I spar with Raymond Daniels,\n\n1:38:46.580 --> 1:38:48.460\n Raymond Daniels is doing me a favor.\n\n1:38:48.460 --> 1:38:49.780\n I ain't doing him a favor.\n\n1:38:49.780 --> 1:38:51.300\n Let's not get it twisted.\n\n1:38:51.300 --> 1:38:53.260\n So thank you so much for your time.\n\n1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:54.100\n I really appreciate it.\n\n1:38:54.100 --> 1:38:56.140\n And this is not like some effected nonsense.\n\n1:38:56.140 --> 1:38:56.980\n This is serious.\n\n1:38:56.980 --> 1:38:57.820\n I'm like, thank you.\n\n1:38:57.820 --> 1:38:58.940\n If I spar with Steven Thompson,\n\n1:38:58.940 --> 1:39:00.060\n I'm the one being done a favor.\n\n1:39:00.060 --> 1:39:01.700\n George St. Pierre takes his time to spar with me,\n\n1:39:01.700 --> 1:39:04.060\n which he has in the past and not even kill me,\n\n1:39:04.060 --> 1:39:05.540\n which is really, I appreciate that\n\n1:39:05.540 --> 1:39:07.860\n because that's why I can sit here.\n\n1:39:07.860 --> 1:39:11.580\n George is not a prop for me to get my rocks off\n\n1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:12.620\n or see what's going on.\n\n1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:14.060\n And also I'm going to do that\n\n1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:16.380\n and then expect him to just take it.\n\n1:39:16.380 --> 1:39:17.740\n And I've seen, he's a gentleman.\n\n1:39:17.740 --> 1:39:19.140\n I've seen people get nuts with George\n\n1:39:19.140 --> 1:39:23.740\n and have him just be like, he's a patient of a saint.\n\n1:39:23.740 --> 1:39:24.780\n I don't have that level of patience,\n\n1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:26.620\n but I would just say to come back,\n\n1:39:26.620 --> 1:39:28.980\n figuring out like, hey, so what role am I here?\n\n1:39:28.980 --> 1:39:30.100\n And that comes back to like,\n\n1:39:30.100 --> 1:39:31.740\n at least what I see people on the internet.\n\n1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:33.660\n Yeah, man, I have a beef with Joe Rogan.\n\n1:39:33.660 --> 1:39:35.100\n You're like, no, you don't, Ryan.\n\n1:39:35.100 --> 1:39:36.380\n You're some goof.\n\n1:39:36.380 --> 1:39:37.660\n I'm like, I'm some random dude.\n\n1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:39.100\n Joe, like people want to,\n\n1:39:39.100 --> 1:39:40.340\n they almost want to like elevate\n\n1:39:40.340 --> 1:39:42.900\n so that we can somehow be level with peers here.\n\n1:39:42.900 --> 1:39:44.500\n If I go into Feroz Zahabi's gym,\n\n1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:45.860\n I am not a peer of Feroz Zahabi.\n\n1:39:45.860 --> 1:39:47.260\n I am a student of TriStar.\n\n1:39:47.260 --> 1:39:48.780\n I'm a guest in the academy.\n\n1:39:48.780 --> 1:39:51.180\n And if Feroz asked me for something short of him,\n\n1:39:51.180 --> 1:39:53.380\n like telling me to try to do a triple backflip\n\n1:39:53.380 --> 1:39:54.660\n so I don't break my neck,\n\n1:39:54.660 --> 1:39:56.660\n the answer is yes, sir, I can do a free Feroz.\n\n1:39:56.660 --> 1:39:57.500\n No, man, in no words.\n\n1:39:57.500 --> 1:39:59.140\n And it's, and hopefully it should come with,\n\n1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:00.940\n I guess, a level of graciousness,\n\n1:40:00.940 --> 1:40:02.340\n but I guess that's kind of one of the things\n\n1:40:02.340 --> 1:40:04.900\n that I see nowadays with how accessible people are.\n\n1:40:04.900 --> 1:40:06.420\n Cause I grew up, you know, being a big,\n\n1:40:06.420 --> 1:40:08.580\n huge baseball sports fan of all kinds.\n\n1:40:08.580 --> 1:40:10.980\n I couldn't send Derek Jeter a message\n\n1:40:10.980 --> 1:40:14.700\n and much less have a possibility of a reply.\n\n1:40:14.700 --> 1:40:17.620\n And if I do, it's like, you know,\n\n1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:18.780\n I have people send me messages.\n\n1:40:18.780 --> 1:40:20.100\n It's very nice that people send me messages.\n\n1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:21.540\n Some people, again, and everyone,\n\n1:40:21.540 --> 1:40:23.580\n not everyone is coming from the same place,\n\n1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:25.100\n but I've had plenty of things that are like,\n\n1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:26.900\n yo, dude, I need you to do this for me.\n\n1:40:26.900 --> 1:40:29.620\n I'm like, well, I'll tell you what's never going to happen.\n\n1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:31.340\n That I have no idea who you are.\n\n1:40:31.340 --> 1:40:32.820\n And that was how I was addressed.\n\n1:40:32.820 --> 1:40:34.860\n And I don't need, oh man, you're the greatest one\n\n1:40:34.860 --> 1:40:36.580\n because that's weird and too, cause I'm not,\n\n1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:39.340\n but just, hey Ryan, how are you doing?\n\n1:40:39.340 --> 1:40:41.060\n Hey, do you think you could do the following\n\n1:40:41.060 --> 1:40:41.900\n if you get a second?\n\n1:40:41.900 --> 1:40:43.620\n I'm like, if I get a second, you're dang right I can.\n\n1:40:43.620 --> 1:40:44.980\n Why not? It's easy to ask.\n\n1:40:44.980 --> 1:40:47.540\n But it started with some level of politeness.\n\n1:40:47.540 --> 1:40:50.340\n And I guess like that's maybe being semi Southern,\n\n1:40:50.340 --> 1:40:51.420\n like I grew up in Virginia.\n\n1:40:51.420 --> 1:40:52.500\n Yes, sir. Yes, ma'm.\n\n1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:54.260\n Like that goes a long way.\n\n1:40:54.260 --> 1:40:55.300\n And there's all different kinds\n\n1:40:55.300 --> 1:40:56.860\n of implementations of politeness.\n\n1:40:56.860 --> 1:40:59.620\n I mean, most of the successful people I've met,\n\n1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:03.700\n it's been surprising to me how much of,\n\n1:41:03.700 --> 1:41:08.500\n you mentioned peers, like I could think of Joe Rogan.\n\n1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:11.020\n You mentioned Joe Rogan, but Elon Musk,\n\n1:41:12.300 --> 1:41:17.300\n they don't, like they almost treat me like I'm the superior.\n\n1:41:17.700 --> 1:41:18.540\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:21.180\n Like it's not even, that's the politeness.\n\n1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:23.340\n Like, you know, that's the approach.\n\n1:41:23.340 --> 1:41:25.180\n The feeling of it is like, I'm the student,\n\n1:41:25.180 --> 1:41:27.620\n I'm the beginner, I'm like approaching the situation.\n\n1:41:27.620 --> 1:41:32.620\n Like it's almost like a method acting of like,\n\n1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:34.960\n you're better than me.\n\n1:41:36.020 --> 1:41:38.180\n And that's how I approach a lot of interactions.\n\n1:41:38.180 --> 1:41:39.620\n Like I have something to learn from this,\n\n1:41:39.620 --> 1:41:41.220\n even if it's like a young.\n\n1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:42.800\n Do you think that they're ungenuine?\n\n1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:44.380\n They're totally genuine.\n\n1:41:44.380 --> 1:41:45.300\n But isn't that a funny thing?\n\n1:41:45.300 --> 1:41:46.400\n Like in spite of who they are,\n\n1:41:46.400 --> 1:41:48.080\n they're incredibly genuine because they respect,\n\n1:41:48.080 --> 1:41:49.860\n correct me if I'm wrong, they respect you obviously\n\n1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:50.700\n for what you bring to the table.\n\n1:41:50.700 --> 1:41:51.540\n They also approach.\n\n1:41:51.540 --> 1:41:52.360\n No, no, they approach everybody like this.\n\n1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:53.200\n But that's all right.\n\n1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:54.820\n No, but I'm sure they respect for what you bring to the table.\n\n1:41:54.820 --> 1:41:56.300\n Beyond that though, they're treating you\n\n1:41:56.300 --> 1:41:57.340\n with dignity as a human being.\n\n1:41:57.340 --> 1:41:59.420\n Yeah, as a human being, that's right.\n\n1:41:59.420 --> 1:42:01.340\n And when they could probably get away\n\n1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:02.340\n with treating most people\n\n1:42:02.340 --> 1:42:03.860\n without a whole heck of a lot of dignity.\n\n1:42:03.860 --> 1:42:05.500\n And I guess what does that always say that like, you know,\n\n1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:08.280\n again, like you can always tell someone of quality\n\n1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:11.760\n because they treat the king and the janitor the same way.\n\n1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:13.340\n But that's what we're seeing a lot.\n\n1:42:13.340 --> 1:42:16.020\n Like, I guess I don't mean to like to nitpick,\n\n1:42:16.020 --> 1:42:18.220\n but that's where it would take issue, I guess a little bit,\n\n1:42:18.220 --> 1:42:19.060\n or disagree with the next.\n\n1:42:19.060 --> 1:42:21.400\n Are you gonna criticize with the internet again?\n\n1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:22.240\n I know.\n\n1:42:22.240 --> 1:42:23.620\n People on the internet.\n\n1:42:23.620 --> 1:42:25.260\n Old man yells at clouds.\n\n1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:30.040\n But anyway, but I guess what I mean is just like\n\n1:42:30.040 --> 1:42:31.660\n the way that people address each other\n\n1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:33.700\n because it's so casual now, you know,\n\n1:42:33.700 --> 1:42:35.600\n and it's great on the one hand, it's nice.\n\n1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:39.460\n On the other hand, you go, hey, I just, why can't do,\n\n1:42:39.460 --> 1:42:42.600\n am I somehow, am I worried about diminishing myself?\n\n1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:44.220\n It's like the way that I'm sure that people talk to like,\n\n1:42:44.220 --> 1:42:45.720\n talk to women sometimes.\n\n1:42:45.720 --> 1:42:48.700\n And words, what's up girl?\n\n1:42:48.700 --> 1:42:49.620\n I mean, she's a bitch.\n\n1:42:49.620 --> 1:42:51.940\n You know, versus like, how am I,\n\n1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:53.860\n that was supposed to get a good response?\n\n1:42:53.860 --> 1:42:57.420\n What about that was going to elicit a favorable response?\n\n1:42:57.420 --> 1:43:01.060\n You know, versus being anything, anything other than just,\n\n1:43:01.060 --> 1:43:02.200\n you know, man, what's going on?\n\n1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:03.980\n And I guess that, does that make any sense?\n\n1:43:03.980 --> 1:43:04.820\n It makes total sense.\n\n1:43:04.820 --> 1:43:06.740\n And that Southern thing that you're referring to,\n\n1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:08.660\n I feel like that's an important,\n\n1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:12.840\n that's an important part of human communication.\n\n1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:14.020\n Let me ask you this.\n\n1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:14.860\n Sure.\n\n1:43:14.860 --> 1:43:16.980\n You're a new back attacks instructional.\n\n1:43:16.980 --> 1:43:19.220\n First of all, awesome.\n\n1:43:19.220 --> 1:43:20.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:20.660 --> 1:43:25.260\n Second of all, you drop a lot of fascinating insights\n\n1:43:25.260 --> 1:43:28.700\n in there, but you quote Galileo out of all people\n\n1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:31.220\n in saying that you can't teach a man anything.\n\n1:43:31.220 --> 1:43:34.320\n You can only help him find it within himself.\n\n1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:39.320\n So we talked about how to start in Jiu Jitsu.\n\n1:43:39.780 --> 1:43:41.740\n What about if we zoom out even more\n\n1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:46.580\n and how do you learn how to learn?\n\n1:43:46.580 --> 1:43:49.560\n How do you optimize the learning process?\n\n1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:51.600\n I don't know the answer to that,\n\n1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:52.760\n but I can tell you what I'd like to do.\n\n1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:54.800\n And I would say like, I can't step one.\n\n1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:57.180\n I don't, I'm not, maybe this is a little bit easier for me\n\n1:43:57.180 --> 1:43:59.820\n cause you know, I've never had a ton of friends, honestly.\n\n1:43:59.820 --> 1:44:01.140\n I've, you know, I've got my close friends\n\n1:44:01.140 --> 1:44:01.960\n and people that I know,\n\n1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:04.120\n but I've never had tons and tons of people.\n\n1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.180\n So I spent a lot of time, you know, thinking.\n\n1:44:06.180 --> 1:44:10.580\n And anyway, I can't, I can't control you.\n\n1:44:10.580 --> 1:44:12.100\n I can't control anybody else.\n\n1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:17.100\n I, you know, I, all I can,\n\n1:44:17.460 --> 1:44:19.980\n I want to take my, it's a Marcus Aurelius thing.\n\n1:44:19.980 --> 1:44:21.380\n It's like, you know, I guess the trick to life\n\n1:44:21.380 --> 1:44:23.500\n is figuring out what's in our control and what's not\n\n1:44:23.500 --> 1:44:25.900\n and focusing on things that are in our control, I guess.\n\n1:44:25.900 --> 1:44:29.820\n And so step one is figuring out both internally\n\n1:44:29.820 --> 1:44:33.140\n and then also out in the world as it pertains to Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:44:33.140 --> 1:44:35.640\n what is actually in my control and what is not.\n\n1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:37.700\n Like passing someone's guard is not in your control.\n\n1:44:37.700 --> 1:44:39.240\n People think it is, it ain't.\n\n1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:43.440\n If I can't just do an activity and be unchecked,\n\n1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:46.680\n then it ain't in my control entirely.\n\n1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:47.900\n I can always breathe.\n\n1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:51.600\n I can always, you know, be calm.\n\n1:44:51.600 --> 1:44:54.200\n I can always, no matter whether I'm concerned\n\n1:44:54.200 --> 1:44:56.300\n or not concerned, have whatever you want to call it,\n\n1:44:56.300 --> 1:44:59.280\n nerves, you know, I can step forward across the line\n\n1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:01.520\n and say, I will, I will face the challenge ahead.\n\n1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:03.740\n That is all entirely, no one can stop me from doing that.\n\n1:45:03.740 --> 1:45:04.780\n That's entirely in my control.\n\n1:45:04.780 --> 1:45:06.840\n And that's why I know that every single time\n\n1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:07.820\n that I walk into the ring,\n\n1:45:07.820 --> 1:45:09.700\n I'll walk in and out of there with my head held high\n\n1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:13.360\n because there's, I will fight with everything that I have.\n\n1:45:13.360 --> 1:45:15.060\n I can't promise that I'll win.\n\n1:45:15.060 --> 1:45:17.820\n I would say I take that same first principles.\n\n1:45:17.820 --> 1:45:19.700\n You mentioned last time we talked, you know,\n\n1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:23.060\n with Elon and the importance of that and going,\n\n1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:24.580\n what are the first principles?\n\n1:45:24.580 --> 1:45:26.700\n And I guess to come back a lot of times, in my opinion,\n\n1:45:26.700 --> 1:45:28.340\n the things that people think are the basics\n\n1:45:28.340 --> 1:45:30.260\n are not the basics.\n\n1:45:30.260 --> 1:45:31.460\n You can't learn.\n\n1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:33.340\n If you think you're reasoning for first principles,\n\n1:45:33.340 --> 1:45:35.180\n but you're actually like level six,\n\n1:45:35.180 --> 1:45:37.220\n you're actually like layers up,\n\n1:45:37.220 --> 1:45:38.420\n you're making so many,\n\n1:45:38.420 --> 1:45:40.740\n there's so many baked in assumptions to what's going on\n\n1:45:40.740 --> 1:45:42.260\n that you're gonna struggle to understand\n\n1:45:42.260 --> 1:45:44.300\n why anything is actually happening,\n\n1:45:44.300 --> 1:45:46.260\n internally, externally, you name it.\n\n1:45:46.260 --> 1:45:48.780\n So I guess what I would start when it comes to learning\n\n1:45:48.780 --> 1:45:50.540\n is first principles and trying to understand\n\n1:45:50.540 --> 1:45:53.420\n what's going on, but then also simple things first.\n\n1:45:53.420 --> 1:45:54.780\n I can control my posture.\n\n1:45:56.220 --> 1:45:57.620\n I can control my breathing.\n\n1:45:58.580 --> 1:45:59.900\n No one can stop me from doing that.\n\n1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:01.780\n I can control where I place my frames.\n\n1:46:01.780 --> 1:46:03.580\n I can control where I place my limbs.\n\n1:46:03.580 --> 1:46:05.500\n I can move my feet.\n\n1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:07.180\n I can develop the ability to do these things\n\n1:46:07.180 --> 1:46:08.020\n better, of course.\n\n1:46:08.020 --> 1:46:09.540\n And I do that through practice, through drilling,\n\n1:46:09.540 --> 1:46:10.500\n through watching people.\n\n1:46:10.500 --> 1:46:12.740\n I've been incredibly fortunate in my time in martial arts\n\n1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:14.260\n to train with many of my heroes,\n\n1:46:14.260 --> 1:46:16.300\n to train with many of the people that I looked at.\n\n1:46:16.300 --> 1:46:18.500\n And I was like, that guy is amazing.\n\n1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:21.380\n I wanna train with this person, like Stephen Thompson,\n\n1:46:21.380 --> 1:46:23.780\n Kenny Florian, George St. Pierre, Raymond Daniels,\n\n1:46:23.780 --> 1:46:26.420\n Farah Zahabi, you know, I mean, like Bruno Frazada,\n\n1:46:26.420 --> 1:46:28.860\n Marcelo Garcia, you know, all of these guys\n\n1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:30.660\n that are just unbelievable.\n\n1:46:30.660 --> 1:46:33.940\n And I go, well, they're moving in a way that's different.\n\n1:46:33.940 --> 1:46:34.860\n Well, how do I do that?\n\n1:46:34.860 --> 1:46:36.140\n Well, sometimes you can ask them\n\n1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:37.180\n and they can tell you directly.\n\n1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:39.620\n Other times, people, part of the genius of what they do\n\n1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:41.060\n is that it's intuitive.\n\n1:46:41.060 --> 1:46:42.980\n And maybe they don't think and understand\n\n1:46:42.980 --> 1:46:44.540\n and see the world the same way that I do.\n\n1:46:44.540 --> 1:46:47.020\n That was something that I experienced with Marcelo.\n\n1:46:47.020 --> 1:46:48.020\n He's amazing.\n\n1:46:48.020 --> 1:46:51.260\n But in a different way than his,\n\n1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:54.180\n it just, we see things fundamentally different.\n\n1:46:54.180 --> 1:46:55.380\n We experience the world differently.\n\n1:46:55.380 --> 1:46:56.820\n It seems to me that we do.\n\n1:46:56.820 --> 1:46:59.820\n And again, that taught me a really important lesson\n\n1:46:59.820 --> 1:47:01.220\n because I was wanting, when I trained there,\n\n1:47:01.220 --> 1:47:03.220\n to have someone go, hey, Ryan, do this, this, this,\n\n1:47:03.220 --> 1:47:04.540\n and this, and that's how it works.\n\n1:47:04.540 --> 1:47:06.380\n And I'm like, all right, because that's how I understood\n\n1:47:06.380 --> 1:47:08.860\n martial arts at the time.\n\n1:47:08.860 --> 1:47:13.500\n I wasn't ready to have someone tell me, like, hey,\n\n1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:16.540\n it feels a little bit like this, and I just kind of do it,\n\n1:47:16.540 --> 1:47:19.180\n which is kind of what Marcelo would do at the time.\n\n1:47:19.180 --> 1:47:20.860\n He was less experienced as a teacher,\n\n1:47:20.860 --> 1:47:22.980\n but that is what he was doing.\n\n1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:26.300\n I was completely, I couldn't separate in my mind\n\n1:47:26.300 --> 1:47:28.820\n performance and understanding.\n\n1:47:28.820 --> 1:47:30.300\n I thought that if I understand, I could do it.\n\n1:47:30.300 --> 1:47:32.420\n And I would also struggle sometimes\n\n1:47:32.420 --> 1:47:35.420\n to wonder why I couldn't execute things\n\n1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:37.260\n that I thought I understood,\n\n1:47:37.260 --> 1:47:40.220\n and why guys like Marcelo were just so elemental.\n\n1:47:40.220 --> 1:47:42.260\n I mean, in like the, like lightning, wind,\n\n1:47:42.260 --> 1:47:44.620\n like that type of thing where like, it's just so in touch\n\n1:47:44.620 --> 1:47:47.660\n with what they wanted, with their capabilities.\n\n1:47:47.660 --> 1:47:49.660\n They could summon their powers at will.\n\n1:47:50.820 --> 1:47:52.260\n I couldn't always do that.\n\n1:47:52.260 --> 1:47:56.500\n And I guess, so recognizing that there was more than one way\n\n1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:58.740\n to the top of the mountain, and also I had a lot of science,\n\n1:47:58.740 --> 1:48:00.660\n but I didn't have a lot of art, or I had some science,\n\n1:48:00.660 --> 1:48:02.500\n I should say, but I didn't have a lot of art.\n\n1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:04.260\n Meeting people like Marcelo taught me,\n\n1:48:04.260 --> 1:48:06.540\n and then Josh Waitzkin, actually brilliant guy,\n\n1:48:06.540 --> 1:48:08.380\n chess champion, former owner,\n\n1:48:08.380 --> 1:48:10.620\n maybe owner of Marcelo's Academy, really great friend.\n\n1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:11.820\n I think he has a book on learning.\n\n1:48:11.820 --> 1:48:13.900\n He does, yeah, The Art of Learning, actually.\n\n1:48:13.900 --> 1:48:15.620\n But yeah, he knows a thing or two about it,\n\n1:48:15.620 --> 1:48:16.460\n but a great guy.\n\n1:48:16.460 --> 1:48:18.140\n And anyway, he sat me down one time,\n\n1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:19.940\n and was like, look, man, you're doing this wrong.\n\n1:48:19.940 --> 1:48:22.300\n You're missing what the, missing the genius,\n\n1:48:22.300 --> 1:48:24.540\n the brilliance that's right in front of you.\n\n1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:26.860\n And it took me a long time.\n\n1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.140\n What did he mean exactly?\n\n1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:31.460\n I was frustrated with my inability\n\n1:48:31.460 --> 1:48:32.700\n to grasp certain things,\n\n1:48:32.700 --> 1:48:34.900\n and sometimes the teaching style being different.\n\n1:48:34.900 --> 1:48:38.700\n Not wrong, just it was, it was tough on me at times.\n\n1:48:38.700 --> 1:48:41.060\n So you were trying to replicate what Marcelo was saying\n\n1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:44.940\n as opposed to understanding the fundamentals\n\n1:48:44.940 --> 1:48:46.100\n from which it was coming.\n\n1:48:46.100 --> 1:48:47.780\n Right, I couldn't see, I couldn't see\n\n1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:48.860\n where it was coming from.\n\n1:48:48.860 --> 1:48:50.340\n And also, sometimes I'm like, well,\n\n1:48:50.340 --> 1:48:51.620\n why can't you explain it in the way\n\n1:48:51.620 --> 1:48:53.020\n that I would want you to explain it?\n\n1:48:53.020 --> 1:48:54.580\n And he's like, well, why can't I meet him\n\n1:48:54.580 --> 1:48:55.900\n where he's coming from?\n\n1:48:55.900 --> 1:48:58.340\n So anyway, it was a really important time,\n\n1:48:58.340 --> 1:48:59.900\n unless I'm very, very frustrating if I'm honest,\n\n1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:03.420\n but it's not, I'm so thankful for that time.\n\n1:49:03.420 --> 1:49:06.100\n And anyway, you know, I guess.\n\n1:49:06.100 --> 1:49:07.220\n So always first principles,\n\n1:49:07.220 --> 1:49:08.780\n trying to understand the basics,\n\n1:49:08.780 --> 1:49:11.900\n first starting at the place where you can control things,\n\n1:49:11.900 --> 1:49:15.060\n the very basic elements of what you can work with.\n\n1:49:15.060 --> 1:49:19.020\n And then when there's other mentors and teachers to.\n\n1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:20.100\n Meet them where they're coming from.\n\n1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:20.940\n Meet them where they're coming from.\n\n1:49:20.940 --> 1:49:21.780\n To the extent that I can.\n\n1:49:21.780 --> 1:49:23.300\n Rather than, I'm not, like, again, it's like,\n\n1:49:23.300 --> 1:49:24.820\n why are you not talking to me\n\n1:49:24.820 --> 1:49:26.740\n the way I want you to talk to me?\n\n1:49:26.740 --> 1:49:28.420\n As opposed to, hey, where are you coming from?\n\n1:49:28.420 --> 1:49:29.660\n Back to your point.\n\n1:49:29.660 --> 1:49:32.220\n But I know that's not entirely specific,\n\n1:49:32.220 --> 1:49:34.540\n but you know, like, if you can focus on that\n\n1:49:34.540 --> 1:49:37.180\n and back to the whole, you can't teach a man anything.\n\n1:49:37.180 --> 1:49:38.980\n Marcelo didn't teach me anything,\n\n1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:41.140\n but he taught me in so doing, like,\n\n1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:45.100\n and other people like that, to find it within.\n\n1:49:45.100 --> 1:49:46.660\n And it's like, yeah, I guess something else\n\n1:49:46.660 --> 1:49:49.860\n that I've heard before is that all learning is self discovery,\n\n1:49:49.860 --> 1:49:52.220\n but all performance is self expression.\n\n1:49:52.220 --> 1:49:54.900\n And I always thought that Marcelo was a brilliant master\n\n1:49:54.900 --> 1:49:56.180\n of letting what's inside out.\n\n1:49:56.180 --> 1:49:59.100\n He was so consistent in his performances.\n\n1:49:59.100 --> 1:50:01.580\n And a lot of times I felt like there was a block there\n\n1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:03.180\n personally, particularly at the end of Jiu Jitsu\n\n1:50:03.180 --> 1:50:04.900\n when I was very, very results oriented.\n\n1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:08.340\n And I wasn't, I think my focus was not ideal.\n\n1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:09.700\n It was definitely not in the place\n\n1:50:09.700 --> 1:50:10.980\n that I would like it to be.\n\n1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:12.980\n And whether it would have won more or lost more,\n\n1:50:12.980 --> 1:50:14.540\n hard to say, but I know that I would have performed better\n\n1:50:14.540 --> 1:50:15.540\n if I'd have adjusted that.\n\n1:50:15.540 --> 1:50:19.420\n And anyway, that recognizing that, again, Jiu Jitsu,\n\n1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:21.300\n I think I've said it before, Jiu Jitsu studies is a science,\n\n1:50:21.300 --> 1:50:22.940\n but expressed as an art.\n\n1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:24.580\n It doesn't matter if you can articulate\n\n1:50:24.580 --> 1:50:25.460\n what you know how to do.\n\n1:50:25.460 --> 1:50:27.420\n What matters is if you can do what you know how to do.\n\n1:50:27.420 --> 1:50:28.420\n It only matters if you're, you know,\n\n1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:30.260\n I guess if you're teaching in a verbal fashion\n\n1:50:30.260 --> 1:50:31.340\n is whether or not you can articulate it,\n\n1:50:31.340 --> 1:50:35.140\n but recognizing the difference between learning\n\n1:50:35.140 --> 1:50:37.540\n on an intellectual level or conceptual level\n\n1:50:37.540 --> 1:50:40.420\n and being able to translate that into the physical.\n\n1:50:40.420 --> 1:50:41.700\n And I guess like that's been the thing\n\n1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:44.260\n that I feel like fortunate over time in my own academy\n\n1:50:44.260 --> 1:50:46.420\n to be able to kind of fiddle around and learn on my own\n\n1:50:46.420 --> 1:50:47.580\n and practice with my students.\n\n1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:49.260\n And, you know, sometimes I struggle\n\n1:50:49.260 --> 1:50:50.540\n to have great training partners.\n\n1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:51.380\n Like when I say great training partner,\n\n1:50:51.380 --> 1:50:53.860\n I mean, other world class people to spar, to roll with,\n\n1:50:53.860 --> 1:50:56.180\n but I've gotten a lot more, honestly,\n\n1:50:56.180 --> 1:50:57.020\n than I ever would have thought\n\n1:50:57.020 --> 1:50:59.740\n out of being able to practice and learn and fail and try\n\n1:50:59.740 --> 1:51:02.620\n and succeed on my own without like my own little sandbox,\n\n1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:06.420\n figuring out how I can take an idea\n\n1:51:06.420 --> 1:51:10.260\n and then come up with drills and drills to practice it\n\n1:51:10.260 --> 1:51:12.340\n so that I can actually practice putting it into play.\n\n1:51:12.340 --> 1:51:15.540\n Because again, knowing an idea and then not drilling,\n\n1:51:15.540 --> 1:51:16.380\n what's the point?\n\n1:51:16.380 --> 1:51:17.220\n I'll never have it.\n\n1:51:17.220 --> 1:51:19.060\n It'll never see the light of day.\n\n1:51:19.060 --> 1:51:22.780\n So in that DVD, in that instruction DVD, sorry.\n\n1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:25.020\n It's an online instructional DVD.\n\n1:51:25.020 --> 1:51:26.020\n I keep saying DVD though.\n\n1:51:26.020 --> 1:51:27.580\n Nobody has DVDs anymore.\n\n1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:28.500\n Do they not? It's like VHS.\n\n1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:29.740\n I don't know.\n\n1:51:29.740 --> 1:51:30.580\n Who has DVDs?\n\n1:51:30.580 --> 1:51:31.620\n What, like Blu Ray?\n\n1:51:31.620 --> 1:51:33.220\n I possess some DVDs.\n\n1:51:33.220 --> 1:51:34.420\n I mean, like I've never watched them.\n\n1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:35.580\n What do you use them for?\n\n1:51:35.580 --> 1:51:40.580\n Like a cup, like a thing you put a drink on?\n\n1:51:41.100 --> 1:51:42.580\n I mean, in a pinch, yeah.\n\n1:51:46.980 --> 1:51:48.980\n What's that even called?\n\n1:51:48.980 --> 1:51:49.820\n Coaster?\n\n1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:52.780\n Yeah, my matrix coaster.\n\n1:51:52.780 --> 1:51:55.660\n The matrix coaster, zeros and ones.\n\n1:51:55.660 --> 1:52:00.300\n Okay, so in that instruction that people should get,\n\n1:52:00.300 --> 1:52:01.180\n I've been watching.\n\n1:52:01.180 --> 1:52:02.140\n I'm really enjoying.\n\n1:52:03.180 --> 1:52:06.500\n It's, I don't even know when it came out recently, right?\n\n1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:07.620\n Like December or something like that?\n\n1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:10.180\n Yeah, it's part one.\n\n1:52:10.180 --> 1:52:12.380\n It was actually like ended up being like 18 hours long\n\n1:52:12.380 --> 1:52:14.100\n and I was like, oh my God, we gotta chop it in half.\n\n1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:16.260\n And when it comes together, the whole thing,\n\n1:52:16.260 --> 1:52:17.300\n I think I hope people will like it.\n\n1:52:17.300 --> 1:52:20.340\n Yeah, well it's even part one is really good.\n\n1:52:20.340 --> 1:52:22.540\n Yeah, people on Reddit were really excited\n\n1:52:22.540 --> 1:52:23.540\n for part two as well.\n\n1:52:23.540 --> 1:52:24.380\n Really?\n\n1:52:24.380 --> 1:52:25.820\n And you also have a back.\n\n1:52:25.820 --> 1:52:26.660\n Oh, the old one.\n\n1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:29.420\n The old one that I, that was really helpful to me\n\n1:52:29.420 --> 1:52:32.700\n to understand some very basic aspects of control\n\n1:52:32.700 --> 1:52:33.540\n for the back.\n\n1:52:33.540 --> 1:52:34.380\n Really?\n\n1:52:34.380 --> 1:52:37.380\n Yeah, that was, you know, that clicked with me.\n\n1:52:37.380 --> 1:52:39.140\n There's very few instructionals.\n\n1:52:39.140 --> 1:52:41.900\n There's very few things I've watched\n\n1:52:41.900 --> 1:52:45.260\n that ever clicked with me and that was definitely it.\n\n1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:48.380\n It taught me one thing, I don't know,\n\n1:52:48.380 --> 1:52:51.740\n it's you drop a lot of sort of bombs,\n\n1:52:51.740 --> 1:52:54.780\n you drop a lot of really interesting details\n\n1:52:54.780 --> 1:52:59.260\n and it's funny that there's only specific things\n\n1:52:59.260 --> 1:53:00.740\n that really click.\n\n1:53:00.740 --> 1:53:03.340\n Like a lot of it rings true and you kind of take it in\n\n1:53:03.340 --> 1:53:05.500\n and it's like, oh, that's interesting, okay, yeah,\n\n1:53:05.500 --> 1:53:07.140\n but there's certain things that really click.\n\n1:53:07.140 --> 1:53:11.180\n And I remember when that first instruction\n\n1:53:11.180 --> 1:53:14.340\n will click with me is like the importance.\n\n1:53:14.340 --> 1:53:17.580\n I don't remember any more like how you communicated it\n\n1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:20.220\n because I've now integrated, it's now mine,\n\n1:53:20.220 --> 1:53:21.820\n you know what I mean?\n\n1:53:21.820 --> 1:53:26.020\n But it was more about you just describing upper body control\n\n1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:29.540\n and the importance of the upper body control from the back.\n\n1:53:29.540 --> 1:53:31.500\n And just like the, there's certain grip,\n\n1:53:31.500 --> 1:53:35.300\n like you did describe different details on the grips\n\n1:53:35.300 --> 1:53:38.060\n and so on and as I started trying it,\n\n1:53:38.060 --> 1:53:42.620\n I realized how important upper body control is\n\n1:53:42.620 --> 1:53:46.140\n versus like me maybe as a blue belt or something\n\n1:53:46.140 --> 1:53:49.180\n was I thought like you have achieved victory\n\n1:53:49.180 --> 1:53:51.420\n when you got the two hooks in.\n\n1:53:51.420 --> 1:53:53.580\n And then I realized like at least for me\n\n1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:56.740\n that the hooks were not even for my body type,\n\n1:53:56.740 --> 1:53:59.300\n for my style, for the way I approach things,\n\n1:53:59.300 --> 1:54:01.020\n they were not even important at all.\n\n1:54:01.020 --> 1:54:02.740\n It's supplemental for the most part, yeah.\n\n1:54:02.740 --> 1:54:04.340\n So they were there for the points\n\n1:54:04.340 --> 1:54:07.180\n but I can establish a huge amount of control.\n\n1:54:08.060 --> 1:54:11.900\n In fact, the hooks were, you were talking about\n\n1:54:11.900 --> 1:54:16.260\n like illusion of choice, it almost made people panic\n\n1:54:16.260 --> 1:54:18.740\n a lot more when you were like fighting for it\n\n1:54:18.740 --> 1:54:20.140\n or establishing that kind of control.\n\n1:54:20.140 --> 1:54:23.020\n They were a lot less panicked when the hooks weren't\n\n1:54:23.020 --> 1:54:25.980\n involved even though they should be a lot more panicked.\n\n1:54:25.980 --> 1:54:28.820\n Anyway, I realized a lot of those kinds of things,\n\n1:54:28.820 --> 1:54:31.860\n especially that had to do with judo because so much\n\n1:54:31.860 --> 1:54:35.780\n of judo on the ground is centered around aggressive,\n\n1:54:35.780 --> 1:54:39.180\n efficient, very fast choking, like different kinds\n\n1:54:39.180 --> 1:54:41.260\n of clock chokes and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:54:41.260 --> 1:54:43.060\n What a brilliant thing that is only gonna start\n\n1:54:43.060 --> 1:54:44.580\n to make its way into jiu jitsu coming up\n\n1:54:44.580 --> 1:54:47.100\n but like the judo style approach to like clock choking,\n\n1:54:47.100 --> 1:54:49.540\n triangling from the top of the turtle and stuff,\n\n1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:50.500\n so powerful.\n\n1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:54.260\n Yeah, and there's something about judo that emphasizes\n\n1:54:54.260 --> 1:54:57.420\n obviously due to the rules, the urgency.\n\n1:54:57.420 --> 1:55:00.260\n So you only do techniques that go fast.\n\n1:55:00.260 --> 1:55:03.940\n And then the other thing is, which I guess\n\n1:55:03.940 --> 1:55:06.820\n jiu jitsu emphasizes too but judo really does,\n\n1:55:06.820 --> 1:55:10.220\n which is the transition.\n\n1:55:10.220 --> 1:55:12.260\n So like while the person's flying in the air\n\n1:55:12.260 --> 1:55:14.060\n is the easiest time.\n\n1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:15.940\n I mean, this is like Ryan Hall type of shit,\n\n1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:20.860\n which is like, why not put in your submissions\n\n1:55:20.860 --> 1:55:23.900\n or positional control while they're in the air?\n\n1:55:23.900 --> 1:55:26.020\n If you could, why would you not, right?\n\n1:55:26.020 --> 1:55:27.420\n It's like, oh, well, I don't throw well.\n\n1:55:27.420 --> 1:55:29.660\n We'll learn how to throw and then do it.\n\n1:55:29.660 --> 1:55:32.580\n And so you should think, I mean, in the transition,\n\n1:55:32.580 --> 1:55:35.180\n when they're flying is the easiest time to put in stuff.\n\n1:55:35.180 --> 1:55:37.900\n And that's when you think about chokes,\n\n1:55:37.900 --> 1:55:40.740\n as you're throwing, you should be thinking about the choke\n\n1:55:40.740 --> 1:55:42.940\n and then everything becomes a lot easier.\n\n1:55:42.940 --> 1:55:44.220\n You ever see Flabio Canto?\n\n1:55:46.100 --> 1:55:48.700\n Man, Brazilian judoka is just so cool.\n\n1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:49.660\n Like with stuff like that.\n\n1:55:49.660 --> 1:55:52.020\n Yeah, exactly, but that has to do\n\n1:55:52.020 --> 1:55:54.860\n with the first starting principle of like,\n\n1:55:54.860 --> 1:55:57.380\n stop thinking this as a two phase game\n\n1:55:57.380 --> 1:56:00.180\n of standing and then ground.\n\n1:56:00.180 --> 1:56:03.740\n Start thinking about like the standing and the,\n\n1:56:03.740 --> 1:56:05.680\n the standing comes before and the ground comes after,\n\n1:56:05.680 --> 1:56:07.700\n but everything happens in a transition.\n\n1:56:07.700 --> 1:56:09.660\n Well, unless you're attacking, what is the art of war?\n\n1:56:09.660 --> 1:56:10.940\n Like, we all like, everyone's like,\n\n1:56:10.940 --> 1:56:12.460\n oh yeah, the art of war, oh yes, yes, yes.\n\n1:56:12.460 --> 1:56:14.020\n And then they immediately throw it away\n\n1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:16.300\n and then fight like a fricking barbarian.\n\n1:56:16.300 --> 1:56:18.540\n But, I mean like, I'm serious,\n\n1:56:18.540 --> 1:56:22.300\n but how many people quote stuff and then like,\n\n1:56:22.300 --> 1:56:23.820\n it's like the, what is it, the family guy joke\n\n1:56:23.820 --> 1:56:26.100\n where they're like, quoting Jesus and Jesus walks in,\n\n1:56:26.100 --> 1:56:27.100\n he's like, you're not listening to my work,\n\n1:56:27.100 --> 1:56:27.980\n what are you talking about?\n\n1:56:27.980 --> 1:56:32.980\n And anyway, basically, like the art of war,\n\n1:56:33.220 --> 1:56:34.700\n one of the things that's like the only thing\n\n1:56:34.700 --> 1:56:37.060\n that you can be sure of being successful in attacking\n\n1:56:37.060 --> 1:56:39.020\n is something that's undefended.\n\n1:56:39.020 --> 1:56:39.860\n We're like, well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:56:39.860 --> 1:56:42.480\n But you know, in a fight though, they're defended.\n\n1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:44.260\n Well, are they?\n\n1:56:44.260 --> 1:56:45.620\n There's moments all the time\n\n1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:47.240\n where I'm borderline defenseless.\n\n1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:49.560\n And if you were to attack at that moment,\n\n1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:51.660\n if you could see it and then seize the moment,\n\n1:56:51.660 --> 1:56:53.280\n if you were capable of both,\n\n1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:54.980\n you should not only expect to be successful,\n\n1:56:54.980 --> 1:56:56.260\n you should be damn sure you're gonna be successful.\n\n1:56:56.260 --> 1:56:58.020\n And more important than that, you'll be successful.\n\n1:56:58.020 --> 1:57:00.140\n And even if somehow not, you won't be countered.\n\n1:57:00.140 --> 1:57:02.740\n And I guess like, that's the trick\n\n1:57:02.740 --> 1:57:05.940\n of almost all like conflict, right?\n\n1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:09.100\n It's like showing up when the other person's taking a nap.\n\n1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:11.780\n And then it's so funny, like we take like a protracted war.\n\n1:57:11.780 --> 1:57:13.220\n It's like, oh, it takes five years.\n\n1:57:13.220 --> 1:57:15.620\n And there's lulls and there's a battle this month,\n\n1:57:15.620 --> 1:57:17.080\n but then there's a couple of weeks, another battle.\n\n1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:18.600\n It's like, well, if you just shrink that down,\n\n1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.700\n it's the microcosm, macrocosm idea.\n\n1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:22.700\n That same thing, that whole war is taking place\n\n1:57:22.700 --> 1:57:24.820\n in five minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes.\n\n1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:27.680\n And there's moments of lulls of person effectively\n\n1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:30.580\n going for a snack, being like in a horror movie,\n\n1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:33.000\n like, hey guys, I'm gonna go get a beer from around the way.\n\n1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.180\n Like I'm dead for sure.\n\n1:57:34.180 --> 1:57:35.700\n So anyway.\n\n1:57:35.700 --> 1:57:38.820\n Is there, on this particular instructional,\n\n1:57:38.820 --> 1:57:40.620\n if you can convert it to words,\n\n1:57:41.620 --> 1:57:43.820\n you talk about finishing the submission.\n\n1:57:43.820 --> 1:57:47.080\n Is there some interesting insights\n\n1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:49.100\n that you find beautiful or profound\n\n1:57:49.100 --> 1:57:51.780\n about finishing the rear neck and choke\n\n1:57:51.780 --> 1:57:54.340\n or just finishing the submissions for the back control?\n\n1:57:54.340 --> 1:57:56.160\n Is there something like, you know,\n\n1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:58.400\n you talk about the squeeze and the crush\n\n1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:00.100\n and all these kinds of principles.\n\n1:58:01.220 --> 1:58:03.380\n Is there something about control\n\n1:58:03.380 --> 1:58:05.780\n about the process of finishing\n\n1:58:05.780 --> 1:58:09.420\n that you find especially profound about this position?\n\n1:58:09.420 --> 1:58:10.240\n Absolutely.\n\n1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:11.860\n The opposite of one profound truth\n\n1:58:11.860 --> 1:58:13.460\n can be another profound truth.\n\n1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:17.780\n So like, it's, I do a.\n\n1:58:17.780 --> 1:58:18.600\n Did Jesus say that?\n\n1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:21.520\n No, I don't, I actually was a guy on Tumblr.\n\n1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:24.300\n But yeah, it was really, really cool.\n\n1:58:24.300 --> 1:58:26.320\n There was like a tree in the background.\n\n1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:30.060\n But anyway, but so let's say like,\n\n1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:31.220\n I'll use examples.\n\n1:58:31.220 --> 1:58:35.080\n Like first off, I saw someone finishing a 50, 50 heel hook\n\n1:58:35.080 --> 1:58:36.980\n in the UFC one promo.\n\n1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:39.180\n It was like some chubby dude in karate,\n\n1:58:39.180 --> 1:58:41.060\n like inside heel hook and another dude.\n\n1:58:41.060 --> 1:58:43.860\n And you go, huh?\n\n1:58:43.860 --> 1:58:45.740\n Well, I didn't know they were doing that back then at least.\n\n1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:46.740\n And whether they were doing it all,\n\n1:58:46.740 --> 1:58:50.340\n how many times did someone do something and then that works?\n\n1:58:50.340 --> 1:58:51.660\n And then we go, okay, cool.\n\n1:58:51.660 --> 1:58:53.480\n Versus, hey, maybe we should do that all the time.\n\n1:58:53.480 --> 1:58:55.340\n So anyway, how long were we all taught\n\n1:58:55.340 --> 1:58:58.260\n to do the seatbelt the way we all do the seatbelt in jiu jitsu?\n\n1:58:58.260 --> 1:58:59.380\n Like long time, why?\n\n1:58:59.380 --> 1:59:00.200\n Works.\n\n1:59:00.200 --> 1:59:01.980\n In fact, it works so well.\n\n1:59:02.860 --> 1:59:05.020\n And it was so, it was then the people who used it\n\n1:59:05.020 --> 1:59:08.860\n were so prolific that we went, well, solve that one.\n\n1:59:08.860 --> 1:59:10.100\n Good to go.\n\n1:59:10.100 --> 1:59:11.900\n All right, no more thinking.\n\n1:59:11.900 --> 1:59:14.140\n And then you go, imagine you were to like the Merkel,\n\n1:59:14.140 --> 1:59:16.200\n the Merkel flip, all those positions that were showing\n\n1:59:16.200 --> 1:59:17.820\n in the DVD, which is pretty much,\n\n1:59:17.820 --> 1:59:21.740\n or whatever the heck it is, the digital VD.\n\n1:59:22.980 --> 1:59:24.500\n No, not VD, don't want that.\n\n1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:26.220\n Digital video something.\n\n1:59:26.220 --> 1:59:31.160\n But basically recognizing that doing it on the wrong side\n\n1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:32.980\n is at least as effective.\n\n1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:34.920\n Doesn't mean that the other side wasn't good.\n\n1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:36.660\n There could be something that's the literal\n\n1:59:36.660 --> 1:59:38.460\n borderline opposite of that.\n\n1:59:38.460 --> 1:59:42.660\n And you go, huh, well, that's something.\n\n1:59:42.660 --> 1:59:44.980\n Like imagine like, I would say almost all of these things,\n\n1:59:44.980 --> 1:59:46.480\n all the tactics and all the strategies.\n\n1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:48.220\n So I guess that was something that we came to\n\n1:59:48.220 --> 1:59:51.140\n like training in the gym like a year ago, maybe,\n\n1:59:51.140 --> 1:59:51.980\n and then playing with sense.\n\n1:59:51.980 --> 1:59:52.800\n And it's just, it's huge.\n\n1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:54.060\n I'm like, oh wait, so let me get this straight.\n\n1:59:54.060 --> 1:59:55.740\n First off, I can use my strong side seatbelt,\n\n1:59:55.740 --> 1:59:58.340\n my right arm over the shoulder all the time.\n\n1:59:58.340 --> 1:59:59.440\n Well, that's really helpful\n\n1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:00.700\n because that's a lot better than my left.\n\n2:00:00.700 --> 2:00:01.580\n I can do both sides of my left,\n\n2:00:01.580 --> 2:00:03.900\n but if I had to bet my life on being able to finish it,\n\n2:00:03.900 --> 2:00:05.820\n I would want my right arm over.\n\n2:00:05.820 --> 2:00:07.740\n Everything that's a tactic or a strategy\n\n2:00:07.740 --> 2:00:08.680\n evolved from an idea.\n\n2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:10.740\n Like capitalism's an idea.\n\n2:00:10.740 --> 2:00:12.500\n Anarchy is an idea, and then it becomes,\n\n2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:13.420\n well, what does that all mean?\n\n2:00:13.420 --> 2:00:14.540\n What are the consequences?\n\n2:00:14.540 --> 2:00:16.060\n What's the fallout of all this, right?\n\n2:00:16.060 --> 2:00:19.140\n So what if we start with jujitsu,\n\n2:00:19.140 --> 2:00:20.260\n the idea of the guard, right?\n\n2:00:20.260 --> 2:00:22.420\n And we go, well, I mean, why do you use the guard?\n\n2:00:22.420 --> 2:00:25.540\n No other martial art really has developed the guard\n\n2:00:25.540 --> 2:00:26.860\n in the same way that jujitsu has.\n\n2:00:26.860 --> 2:00:27.740\n Well, what is the guard?\n\n2:00:27.740 --> 2:00:29.700\n A guard's a defensive idea where you're kind of\n\n2:00:29.700 --> 2:00:31.940\n on your back to some extent or another,\n\n2:00:31.940 --> 2:00:33.780\n and you're using your legs as a wall between you\n\n2:00:33.780 --> 2:00:36.300\n and the other person, and the other guy represents danger.\n\n2:00:36.300 --> 2:00:38.260\n And you're like, yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.\n\n2:00:38.260 --> 2:00:39.420\n Is it?\n\n2:00:39.420 --> 2:00:41.580\n I mean, it clearly works, at least to a certain extent,\n\n2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:44.980\n but where do I want to put my legs when I want to get up?\n\n2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:45.820\n Not on the other dude.\n\n2:00:45.820 --> 2:00:47.580\n I'm trying to put them on things on the floor.\n\n2:00:47.580 --> 2:00:49.660\n If I want to generate a ton of power,\n\n2:00:49.660 --> 2:00:51.100\n what's the first thing I do with my feet?\n\n2:00:51.100 --> 2:00:52.380\n I anchor them to the floor.\n\n2:00:52.380 --> 2:00:53.740\n Drive for a punch, you name it.\n\n2:00:53.740 --> 2:00:56.300\n Move away, jump, dart, you name it.\n\n2:00:56.300 --> 2:00:58.660\n So does it mean that that's a terrible idea\n\n2:00:58.660 --> 2:00:59.500\n to be on your back?\n\n2:00:59.500 --> 2:01:00.780\n No, clearly it works.\n\n2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:03.300\n And clearly it has function.\n\n2:01:03.300 --> 2:01:04.940\n But what if the function that we're giving it\n\n2:01:04.940 --> 2:01:08.300\n and how much focus we're assigning to it\n\n2:01:08.300 --> 2:01:11.260\n is disproportionate to its effectiveness?\n\n2:01:11.260 --> 2:01:13.180\n Maybe, what if it's not a good idea?\n\n2:01:13.180 --> 2:01:15.060\n I'm not saying it's not a good idea, but what if it wasn't?\n\n2:01:15.060 --> 2:01:16.940\n That's a foundational idea of jujitsu.\n\n2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:20.260\n And then how much, because no one questions that foundation,\n\n2:01:20.260 --> 2:01:22.980\n how much innovation is built on top of the idea?\n\n2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:24.300\n Well, of course I want to be,\n\n2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.940\n my being on my back is in okay position.\n\n2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:27.300\n So now they're innovating,\n\n2:01:27.300 --> 2:01:29.180\n but they're innovating within a closed system\n\n2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:32.380\n that they think they're innovating in this open space\n\n2:01:32.380 --> 2:01:33.540\n of, oh my God, it can be anything,\n\n2:01:33.540 --> 2:01:36.380\n when in reality it can be anything within this little set.\n\n2:01:36.380 --> 2:01:37.820\n But you don't realize that you're in a set.\n\n2:01:37.820 --> 2:01:39.420\n You don't realize that you're in a box.\n\n2:01:39.420 --> 2:01:40.860\n There would be answers that would become\n\n2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:42.620\n so immediately apparent to you\n\n2:01:42.620 --> 2:01:44.740\n if you were willing to look outside of that,\n\n2:01:44.740 --> 2:01:47.260\n but you'll literally never even look over to your left\n\n2:01:47.260 --> 2:01:49.900\n because you don't even realize the left exists.\n\n2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:52.340\n Do you think there's a lot of places in jujitsu,\n\n2:01:52.340 --> 2:01:54.460\n whether it's back control or generally guards\n\n2:01:54.460 --> 2:01:55.940\n and all the different positions,\n\n2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:58.340\n where there's a lot of space,\n\n2:01:58.340 --> 2:02:01.740\n like a lot to be discovered\n\n2:02:01.740 --> 2:02:03.820\n by questioning the basic assumptions.\n\n2:02:03.820 --> 2:02:06.180\n Maybe if you can give examples of like back control,\n\n2:02:06.180 --> 2:02:08.100\n like, is there something you've discovered that's like?\n\n2:02:08.100 --> 2:02:09.700\n Merkle versus seatbelt.\n\n2:02:09.700 --> 2:02:10.820\n What's Merkle with seatbelt?\n\n2:02:10.820 --> 2:02:13.140\n Seatbelt is a right arm over the shoulder,\n\n2:02:13.140 --> 2:02:14.860\n left arm under the arm.\n\n2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:17.600\n I'm on the same side as my choking arm.\n\n2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:19.260\n Merkle is just, I do the same thing.\n\n2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:20.580\n I don't even adjust my hands.\n\n2:02:20.580 --> 2:02:22.060\n I walk myself over to the left side.\n\n2:02:22.060 --> 2:02:23.020\n I'm on the opposite side.\n\n2:02:23.020 --> 2:02:24.340\n It's actually a more powerful position.\n\n2:02:24.340 --> 2:02:25.460\n Yeah, for people listening,\n\n2:02:25.460 --> 2:02:26.820\n for people who might not know,\n\n2:02:26.820 --> 2:02:30.260\n jujitsu is a, seatbelt is a control.\n\n2:02:30.260 --> 2:02:32.380\n We're talking about when one person\n\n2:02:32.380 --> 2:02:34.100\n is on the back of another person,\n\n2:02:34.100 --> 2:02:36.540\n which is a really dominant position in jujitsu,\n\n2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:41.180\n seatbelt is a, I guess, widely accepted way\n\n2:02:41.180 --> 2:02:42.020\n of holding your arm.\n\n2:02:42.020 --> 2:02:42.860\n Like best practices on those kinds of things.\n\n2:02:42.860 --> 2:02:45.340\n Best practices, yeah, and it's worked so well.\n\n2:02:45.340 --> 2:02:49.220\n So it's a one arm over, one arm under,\n\n2:02:49.220 --> 2:02:50.540\n and there's a certain side\n\n2:02:50.540 --> 2:02:53.820\n you're supposed to be on when you're on the back.\n\n2:02:53.820 --> 2:02:56.020\n Everyone teaches, there's a choking arm,\n\n2:02:56.020 --> 2:02:57.620\n that's the arm that's over,\n\n2:02:57.620 --> 2:02:58.780\n and your body's supposed to be\n\n2:02:58.780 --> 2:03:01.060\n on a certain side relative to that.\n\n2:03:01.060 --> 2:03:03.060\n And then Ryan is describing,\n\n2:03:03.060 --> 2:03:06.260\n questioning these basic assumptions\n\n2:03:06.260 --> 2:03:07.740\n of which side you're supposed to be on.\n\n2:03:07.740 --> 2:03:09.780\n And let's say that's even just like a mid level assumption.\n\n2:03:09.780 --> 2:03:11.660\n It's not even a first principles assumption,\n\n2:03:11.660 --> 2:03:12.700\n but it's pretty close to.\n\n2:03:12.700 --> 2:03:14.740\n It's getting there, but let's just say,\n\n2:03:14.740 --> 2:03:18.320\n for sake of argument, it goes a lot deeper, maybe.\n\n2:03:18.320 --> 2:03:21.740\n I think most of the innovation that I see is not innovation.\n\n2:03:21.740 --> 2:03:24.820\n It's like basically changing the color of a car\n\n2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:27.260\n or polishing like the window a little bit,\n\n2:03:27.260 --> 2:03:28.260\n where you're like, hey, you made it,\n\n2:03:28.260 --> 2:03:29.620\n you made it a little bit different,\n\n2:03:29.620 --> 2:03:30.900\n you made it a little bit better.\n\n2:03:30.900 --> 2:03:32.800\n It's like, oh man, what if I did the same guard\n\n2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:34.060\n and then grab the lapel?\n\n2:03:34.060 --> 2:03:35.300\n I'm not saying that's bad,\n\n2:03:35.300 --> 2:03:37.220\n but you're not fundamentally changing anything.\n\n2:03:37.220 --> 2:03:39.140\n I think most of the big seismic shifts\n\n2:03:39.140 --> 2:03:41.220\n that we see in almost anything come from,\n\n2:03:41.220 --> 2:03:44.760\n hey, that thing we thought was right was wrong,\n\n2:03:44.760 --> 2:03:48.100\n rather than not only is it right, it's even righter.\n\n2:03:48.100 --> 2:03:49.580\n And you're like, that's not wrong, that's not bad,\n\n2:03:49.580 --> 2:03:52.440\n but that's, it's like, oh man, let's say, for instance,\n\n2:03:52.440 --> 2:03:53.400\n I didn't make the triangle better,\n\n2:03:53.400 --> 2:03:54.920\n but let's say I made the triangle a little bit better\n\n2:03:54.920 --> 2:03:56.760\n than it was, or than it was taught.\n\n2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:00.020\n I mean, you can call it innovation.\n\n2:04:00.020 --> 2:04:00.860\n I don't know, man.\n\n2:04:00.860 --> 2:04:01.860\n It's not like the person that said,\n\n2:04:01.860 --> 2:04:03.660\n hey, have you guys ever heard of a triangle before\n\n2:04:03.660 --> 2:04:04.500\n and came up with that?\n\n2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:06.600\n We're like, that is, you're like, that's on the list?\n\n2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:07.680\n You can do this thing to people?\n\n2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:08.520\n Are you kidding me?\n\n2:04:08.520 --> 2:04:11.540\n Can you imagine you invented the straight right hand?\n\n2:04:11.540 --> 2:04:12.580\n You'll be like one punch man.\n\n2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:14.580\n You can walk around and just lay low\n\n2:04:14.580 --> 2:04:16.200\n every single person you got into a fight with,\n\n2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:18.300\n because it didn't even occur to them to hit you\n\n2:04:18.300 --> 2:04:19.500\n with their back hand.\n\n2:04:19.500 --> 2:04:22.240\n In a world full of jabbers, you throw your back hand.\n\n2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:23.500\n You're gonna kill people.\n\n2:04:23.500 --> 2:04:24.340\n So basically.\n\n2:04:24.340 --> 2:04:26.980\n Well, but by the way, I mean, just to pause on that,\n\n2:04:26.980 --> 2:04:29.660\n first of all, somebody did invent the triangle probably,\n\n2:04:29.660 --> 2:04:30.500\n right?\n\n2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:31.320\n For sure.\n\n2:04:31.320 --> 2:04:32.160\n It's not a trivial thing once you think.\n\n2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:33.000\n No.\n\n2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:35.200\n How many of these giant things that we all go like,\n\n2:04:35.200 --> 2:04:36.500\n oh yeah, yeah, yeah, we all use that now.\n\n2:04:36.500 --> 2:04:38.760\n Can you imagine you have triangles and heel hooks\n\n2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:41.780\n and rear naked chokes and I don't have those?\n\n2:04:41.780 --> 2:04:43.260\n You're on beat, you're borderline, I mean, like,\n\n2:04:43.260 --> 2:04:45.380\n that's why, that's, we all, every single one of this,\n\n2:04:45.380 --> 2:04:46.340\n particularly those of us, I mean,\n\n2:04:46.340 --> 2:04:48.780\n when did you first start training, Lex?\n\n2:04:48.780 --> 2:04:51.900\n 12, 13, well, let's not count wrestling,\n\n2:04:51.900 --> 2:04:53.740\n but 13 years ago with Jiu Jitsu.\n\n2:04:53.740 --> 2:04:54.580\n Right on.\n\n2:04:54.580 --> 2:04:55.940\n So let's say about that time where particularly\n\n2:04:55.940 --> 2:04:58.140\n it was still like kind of, kind of undergroundy,\n\n2:04:58.140 --> 2:05:00.340\n you know, and you're like, hey, we all experienced\n\n2:05:00.340 --> 2:05:03.660\n being like a relative, like a mid level white belt\n\n2:05:03.660 --> 2:05:06.300\n and being able to easily beat up all our friends\n\n2:05:06.300 --> 2:05:07.700\n because everyone wrestled other buddies.\n\n2:05:07.700 --> 2:05:09.240\n And it was one of those ones where like,\n\n2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:11.500\n they don't have weapons to end the fight.\n\n2:05:11.500 --> 2:05:13.860\n You have weapons to end the fight.\n\n2:05:13.860 --> 2:05:16.700\n That's so, that's such a crazy, you know,\n\n2:05:16.700 --> 2:05:21.700\n asymmetric advantage that if you lose, it's on you now, man.\n\n2:05:21.900 --> 2:05:23.940\n Like, like you had the, next time it's like,\n\n2:05:23.940 --> 2:05:26.060\n I've got this rifle and you have nothing.\n\n2:05:26.060 --> 2:05:27.820\n And I decided to put it on my back and then run over\n\n2:05:27.820 --> 2:05:28.660\n and try to karate chop.\n\n2:05:28.660 --> 2:05:30.440\n You're like, okay, next time,\n\n2:05:30.440 --> 2:05:31.940\n just make sure you use the rifle, bud.\n\n2:05:31.940 --> 2:05:33.420\n I'm like, oh yeah, I should do that.\n\n2:05:33.420 --> 2:05:34.260\n So.\n\n2:05:34.260 --> 2:05:35.260\n Yeah, it's kind of fascinating to,\n\n2:05:35.260 --> 2:05:38.020\n I mean, everything you're describing is a,\n\n2:05:38.020 --> 2:05:40.180\n there's a fascinating tension between like,\n\n2:05:40.180 --> 2:05:41.760\n whatever I show people for the first time,\n\n2:05:41.760 --> 2:05:43.960\n what a triangle is, just like regular people.\n\n2:05:45.120 --> 2:05:46.580\n It's like, they're discovering is like,\n\n2:05:46.580 --> 2:05:47.980\n oh, okay, that's interesting.\n\n2:05:47.980 --> 2:05:49.180\n I mean, MMA has changed that,\n\n2:05:49.180 --> 2:05:51.580\n but people haven't watched MMA.\n\n2:05:51.580 --> 2:05:52.740\n That's an interesting move.\n\n2:05:52.740 --> 2:05:54.740\n It doesn't make sense why that would be a choke.\n\n2:05:54.740 --> 2:05:59.340\n And they kind of quickly accepted that's a thing\n\n2:05:59.340 --> 2:06:02.660\n and they accept the basics without questioning,\n\n2:06:02.660 --> 2:06:05.460\n wait a minute, what's actually being choked?\n\n2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:10.540\n How is it that a shoulder of a person\n\n2:06:10.540 --> 2:06:12.640\n can do the choking?\n\n2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:15.300\n Like, I'm not sure I fully question\n\n2:06:15.300 --> 2:06:16.780\n the fundamentals of all of that.\n\n2:06:16.780 --> 2:06:19.780\n Like, what exactly is the blood supply\n\n2:06:19.780 --> 2:06:21.300\n that's being cut off?\n\n2:06:21.300 --> 2:06:24.020\n Like, what is the anatomy and the physiology\n\n2:06:24.020 --> 2:06:24.860\n of all of that?\n\n2:06:24.860 --> 2:06:25.680\n Why does this work?\n\n2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:26.520\n And if you understood all that,\n\n2:06:26.520 --> 2:06:27.340\n what else can we do here?\n\n2:06:27.340 --> 2:06:28.680\n Yeah, what else can we do here?\n\n2:06:28.680 --> 2:06:29.940\n That's the really important thing.\n\n2:06:29.940 --> 2:06:31.600\n But if we know, if I'm an end user,\n\n2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:33.280\n which almost everyone is of almost anything,\n\n2:06:33.280 --> 2:06:34.780\n I'm serious, where I'm like,\n\n2:06:34.780 --> 2:06:35.740\n I think about stuff in my life,\n\n2:06:35.740 --> 2:06:36.940\n the only things I really think about\n\n2:06:36.940 --> 2:06:39.180\n are like martial arts and martial arts strategy\n\n2:06:39.180 --> 2:06:41.220\n and like, I don't know, some other couple,\n\n2:06:41.220 --> 2:06:42.700\n a couple other things, but not much.\n\n2:06:42.700 --> 2:06:46.100\n And anything else in my life is borderline unexamined.\n\n2:06:46.100 --> 2:06:47.780\n And I like to think that if I put a lot of effort\n\n2:06:47.780 --> 2:06:49.460\n in something, I'd like to think that I could figure\n\n2:06:49.460 --> 2:06:50.740\n at least some things out about it,\n\n2:06:50.740 --> 2:06:53.100\n but I figured out almost nothing about anything in my life\n\n2:06:53.100 --> 2:06:54.740\n because I haven't even looked.\n\n2:06:54.740 --> 2:06:57.820\n And if you're an end user, what are you capable of\n\n2:06:57.820 --> 2:07:00.800\n versus you can literally alter the source code.\n\n2:07:00.800 --> 2:07:02.820\n You are Neo in the fricking matrix,\n\n2:07:02.820 --> 2:07:04.900\n if you can alter the code and I can't.\n\n2:07:04.900 --> 2:07:06.980\n And it's like, we think, ah, ah, ah, ah,\n\n2:07:06.980 --> 2:07:10.700\n but imagine you are a world class anything,\n\n2:07:10.700 --> 2:07:11.940\n or you're not even world class, forget it.\n\n2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:13.800\n Like a purple belt compared to a white belt\n\n2:07:13.800 --> 2:07:16.080\n or compared to a no belt might as well be John Jones\n\n2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:18.940\n or Marcelo Garcia, you're gonna beat them up comparably bad.\n\n2:07:18.940 --> 2:07:21.900\n So it's, that actually is a common thing\n\n2:07:21.900 --> 2:07:23.420\n where people can't tell the difference between levels.\n\n2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:24.260\n They're like, oh man, I've trained\n\n2:07:24.260 --> 2:07:25.100\n with my black belt instructor,\n\n2:07:25.100 --> 2:07:26.380\n how much better could so and so be?\n\n2:07:26.380 --> 2:07:29.460\n Like, so much better you're gonna have a hard time\n\n2:07:29.460 --> 2:07:30.300\n wrapping your head around it.\n\n2:07:30.300 --> 2:07:32.820\n I remember when I first trained with Marcelo Garcia in 2007,\n\n2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:34.380\n I was a decent purple belt.\n\n2:07:34.380 --> 2:07:36.300\n And of course he mollywopped me very gently.\n\n2:07:36.300 --> 2:07:39.340\n And then training with him again in 2008,\n\n2:07:39.340 --> 2:07:40.300\n I was definitely better.\n\n2:07:40.300 --> 2:07:42.980\n I won the gi and no gi worlds that you're a purple belt.\n\n2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:44.220\n So definitely for the record,\n\n2:07:44.220 --> 2:07:45.540\n I'm definitely not a jujitsu world champion.\n\n2:07:45.540 --> 2:07:46.380\n I wanted the purple belt,\n\n2:07:46.380 --> 2:07:48.940\n but like, that's not the same at winning a black belt\n\n2:07:48.940 --> 2:07:50.380\n and a tough accomplishment,\n\n2:07:50.380 --> 2:07:51.900\n but not in the same thing at all.\n\n2:07:51.900 --> 2:07:54.940\n But anyway, I was definitely better.\n\n2:07:54.940 --> 2:07:55.940\n He beat me up just the same.\n\n2:07:55.940 --> 2:07:59.700\n I'm like, okay, 2009, I was a lot better.\n\n2:07:59.700 --> 2:08:02.300\n Got a medal at ADCC that time, won the trials,\n\n2:08:02.300 --> 2:08:04.940\n crushed everybody, like no, just submitted everybody\n\n2:08:04.940 --> 2:08:06.700\n like bop, bop, bop, bop.\n\n2:08:06.700 --> 2:08:09.820\n Training with Marcelo Garcia, it was worse.\n\n2:08:09.820 --> 2:08:13.420\n And in 2010, training with Marcelo Garcia, same, same.\n\n2:08:13.420 --> 2:08:17.180\n So the idea was, I wouldn't be able to tell you\n\n2:08:17.180 --> 2:08:19.420\n the difference and the outcome difference\n\n2:08:19.420 --> 2:08:20.820\n was the same in all of these rounds.\n\n2:08:20.820 --> 2:08:22.540\n I was significantly more experienced\n\n2:08:22.540 --> 2:08:25.500\n and more adept each time that this occurred.\n\n2:08:25.500 --> 2:08:27.260\n But it was like, how many number of times\n\n2:08:27.260 --> 2:08:29.020\n did this person submit you or pass your guard in the round?\n\n2:08:29.020 --> 2:08:30.300\n I'm like, I don't know, probably like,\n\n2:08:30.300 --> 2:08:31.500\n let's say five each one,\n\n2:08:31.500 --> 2:08:33.020\n because it's gonna be a brief period of time.\n\n2:08:33.020 --> 2:08:34.140\n And let's say it was three on one,\n\n2:08:34.140 --> 2:08:35.620\n six on another, I'm like, whatever, it's comparable.\n\n2:08:35.620 --> 2:08:37.740\n It's six one and a half dozen.\n\n2:08:37.740 --> 2:08:40.340\n Would I be able to easily tell the difference?\n\n2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:42.300\n No, I would just say, I know in concept\n\n2:08:42.300 --> 2:08:44.540\n that he's way better, so much better.\n\n2:08:44.540 --> 2:08:45.740\n But there's plenty of other people\n\n2:08:45.740 --> 2:08:47.820\n that could have beaten me just as bad as Marcelo did\n\n2:08:47.820 --> 2:08:49.940\n when I was a purple belt or when I was a brown belt.\n\n2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:51.660\n Then maybe I would watch Marcelo walk through\n\n2:08:51.660 --> 2:08:53.300\n like their borderline, not there.\n\n2:08:53.300 --> 2:08:54.340\n So it's neat.\n\n2:08:54.340 --> 2:08:57.020\n Like if you, that's back to kind of what I was talking about\n\n2:08:57.020 --> 2:08:59.860\n about certain people beginning to really like peel back\n\n2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:03.220\n some of what's really special about the martial arts\n\n2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:06.140\n or any activity I presume is they get to a level\n\n2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:08.700\n of understanding in depth that they're playing\n\n2:09:08.700 --> 2:09:11.580\n with like the almost the reality of that thing.\n\n2:09:11.580 --> 2:09:14.220\n And I'm playing by rules that are not rules.\n\n2:09:14.220 --> 2:09:16.620\n I'm not even one of the, to use a matrix analogy,\n\n2:09:16.620 --> 2:09:18.860\n I'm not even an agent, which is the best version\n\n2:09:18.860 --> 2:09:21.260\n of something playing by the rules.\n\n2:09:21.260 --> 2:09:22.780\n I'm like one of the regular people\n\n2:09:22.780 --> 2:09:25.460\n or one of the regular people that got out of the matrix.\n\n2:09:25.460 --> 2:09:27.180\n So I'm like, oh, I'm cool, but when I fight an agent,\n\n2:09:27.180 --> 2:09:29.860\n I lose because we're both in the rules,\n\n2:09:29.860 --> 2:09:32.580\n but they just play them to the bone and I'm just here.\n\n2:09:32.580 --> 2:09:34.700\n Well, and then the agent encounters Neo\n\n2:09:34.700 --> 2:09:36.100\n and they can do nothing.\n\n2:09:36.100 --> 2:09:36.940\n You're like, why?\n\n2:09:36.940 --> 2:09:38.940\n Because it's operating outside of what the rules are,\n\n2:09:38.940 --> 2:09:40.140\n but not really what the rules are,\n\n2:09:40.140 --> 2:09:42.260\n what they perceive to be the rules are clearly.\n\n2:09:42.260 --> 2:09:43.580\n So anyway, I guess that's kind of my point\n\n2:09:43.580 --> 2:09:45.060\n about Marcelo or certain other people\n\n2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:46.020\n that are doing things where you go,\n\n2:09:46.020 --> 2:09:48.300\n that doesn't even seem real.\n\n2:09:48.300 --> 2:09:49.420\n It doesn't seem real to me\n\n2:09:49.420 --> 2:09:51.260\n because I don't understand what's going on.\n\n2:09:51.260 --> 2:09:53.820\n And I guess if we can get down to base assumptions,\n\n2:09:53.820 --> 2:09:55.820\n like if we can constantly strip away, strip away,\n\n2:09:55.820 --> 2:09:57.860\n strip away, let's say we always thought\n\n2:09:57.860 --> 2:09:59.620\n that turning left was right, was correct.\n\n2:09:59.620 --> 2:10:01.860\n And it turns out that turning right was correct.\n\n2:10:01.860 --> 2:10:02.940\n Change your life.\n\n2:10:02.940 --> 2:10:05.820\n Yeah, it's a, what is it, Socrates said,\n\n2:10:05.820 --> 2:10:08.220\n the unexamined life is not worth living.\n\n2:10:08.220 --> 2:10:10.740\n So you just basically have to rigorously\n\n2:10:10.740 --> 2:10:13.460\n just constantly examine every assumption\n\n2:10:13.460 --> 2:10:14.380\n over and over and over.\n\n2:10:14.380 --> 2:10:15.940\n But doesn't that give your life meaning\n\n2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:17.020\n to come back to the struggle,\n\n2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:18.740\n to come back to free will, to come back to,\n\n2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:20.100\n what if we could strip all that away?\n\n2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:20.940\n All right, cool.\n\n2:10:20.940 --> 2:10:22.740\n All right, let me just stick the needle in my arm\n\n2:10:22.740 --> 2:10:23.580\n and that's that.\n\n2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:27.460\n Yeah, no, I mean that constant striving\n\n2:10:27.460 --> 2:10:32.460\n for understanding yet another lower layer\n\n2:10:32.580 --> 2:10:34.460\n of the simulation we're living in\n\n2:10:34.460 --> 2:10:38.340\n is something that's actually deeply fulfilling\n\n2:10:38.340 --> 2:10:40.300\n that I don't know if it's genetically built in,\n\n2:10:40.300 --> 2:10:43.100\n but there's something about that striving to understand\n\n2:10:43.100 --> 2:10:45.820\n that seems to be deeply human.\n\n2:10:45.820 --> 2:10:47.540\n Which is funny, what makes a human,\n\n2:10:47.540 --> 2:10:49.220\n we don't talk about the soul anymore, man.\n\n2:10:49.220 --> 2:10:50.900\n I went to Catholic school as a kid.\n\n2:10:50.900 --> 2:10:52.780\n Whether you buy into all that stuff or not,\n\n2:10:52.780 --> 2:10:55.420\n you're like, what about the soul of a person,\n\n2:10:55.420 --> 2:10:58.860\n the spirit of a people, the spirit of a nation,\n\n2:10:58.860 --> 2:11:00.820\n anywhere, the spirit of humanity?\n\n2:11:00.820 --> 2:11:04.140\n We talk about everything like it's this quantifiable thing\n\n2:11:04.140 --> 2:11:06.420\n when maybe certain things are, maybe everything is,\n\n2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:07.860\n but then what happens if there's things\n\n2:11:07.860 --> 2:11:09.900\n that just aren't quantifiable,\n\n2:11:09.900 --> 2:11:12.180\n that nothing in our understanding can\n\n2:11:12.180 --> 2:11:13.100\n or will ever explain it?\n\n2:11:13.100 --> 2:11:14.420\n That doesn't mean that that should be our assumption.\n\n2:11:14.420 --> 2:11:15.940\n It's for your assumption that we can explain everything\n\n2:11:15.940 --> 2:11:18.380\n and let's get to the dang bottom, peel, peel, peel, peel.\n\n2:11:18.380 --> 2:11:20.100\n But what if there is actually something\n\n2:11:20.100 --> 2:11:24.340\n that we need challenge for?\n\n2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:26.420\n And we could be looking in the wrong place\n\n2:11:26.420 --> 2:11:28.100\n by going, oh, is it in the genes?\n\n2:11:28.100 --> 2:11:28.940\n Maybe it is.\n\n2:11:28.940 --> 2:11:29.980\n Again, I'm not saying we're looking in the wrong place\n\n2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:31.580\n like I would know anything, I do karate.\n\n2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:34.460\n But basically, not even well.\n\n2:11:34.460 --> 2:11:36.860\n But yeah, we do karate, mediocre,\n\n2:11:36.860 --> 2:11:38.460\n just ask Raymond Daniels or Stephen Thompson.\n\n2:11:38.460 --> 2:11:41.060\n But I guess to come back, though, you just.\n\n2:11:41.060 --> 2:11:43.100\n Are you a yellow belt yet, or are you?\n\n2:11:43.100 --> 2:11:45.300\n Man, I actually, have you ever seen the Seinfeld episode\n\n2:11:45.300 --> 2:11:47.260\n where Kramer fights the kids?\n\n2:11:47.260 --> 2:11:48.980\n Yeah, I did that at Raymond Daniels school\n\n2:11:48.980 --> 2:11:53.140\n and the kids won in class in addition to the alleyway.\n\n2:11:53.140 --> 2:11:55.780\n Oh, they finished it off afterwards.\n\n2:11:55.780 --> 2:11:58.060\n Yeah, exactly, when I was on my last legs.\n\n2:11:58.060 --> 2:12:02.180\n But yeah, I would just, maybe, it's funny,\n\n2:12:02.180 --> 2:12:04.060\n I feel like there's something deeply missing\n\n2:12:04.060 --> 2:12:07.060\n from public understanding anymore.\n\n2:12:07.060 --> 2:12:09.860\n It's almost like the idea that we can figure everything out,\n\n2:12:09.860 --> 2:12:12.500\n which I deeply believe in, but also the possibility\n\n2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:14.740\n that there's some things that we'll never really see\n\n2:12:14.740 --> 2:12:15.860\n and some things we'll never understand.\n\n2:12:15.860 --> 2:12:17.860\n And there's something, like you said,\n\n2:12:17.860 --> 2:12:20.340\n uniquely human about the human experience,\n\n2:12:20.340 --> 2:12:23.900\n that even if I had the power to change,\n\n2:12:23.900 --> 2:12:25.340\n I don't wanna fuck with it, man.\n\n2:12:25.340 --> 2:12:27.100\n I don't wanna change that thing.\n\n2:12:27.100 --> 2:12:28.580\n Oh, yeah, well, wouldn't it be great\n\n2:12:28.580 --> 2:12:31.100\n if we just immediately knew the outcome of everything\n\n2:12:31.100 --> 2:12:32.420\n and you just press this button, you're like,\n\n2:12:32.420 --> 2:12:34.260\n oh, that's gonna, what's the point of living life then?\n\n2:12:34.260 --> 2:12:35.820\n Even if you could do it, it's the,\n\n2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:37.300\n Ian, you've seen Jurassic Park, I'll leave you to be sorry,\n\n2:12:37.300 --> 2:12:38.260\n I know what I'm talking about.\n\n2:12:38.260 --> 2:12:40.700\n Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park, Jeff Goldblum, right?\n\n2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:43.300\n Life finds a way.\n\n2:12:43.300 --> 2:12:46.420\n But we were so concerned with whether or not we could,\n\n2:12:46.420 --> 2:12:49.740\n we didn't stop to think whether or not we should.\n\n2:12:49.740 --> 2:12:50.780\n Maybe?\n\n2:12:50.780 --> 2:12:54.420\n I think there's, I mean, it's a deeply human thing,\n\n2:12:54.420 --> 2:12:56.260\n but it's also a really useful thing\n\n2:12:56.260 --> 2:12:59.860\n to always kind of assume that there's this giant thing\n\n2:12:59.860 --> 2:13:01.620\n that you don't understand.\n\n2:13:01.620 --> 2:13:04.460\n So you can forever be striving to understand\n\n2:13:04.460 --> 2:13:07.980\n because that process gives you meaning,\n\n2:13:07.980 --> 2:13:10.220\n but also keeps making you better.\n\n2:13:10.220 --> 2:13:12.620\n Like thinking that, actually even just thinking\n\n2:13:12.620 --> 2:13:15.220\n that you can't understand everything\n\n2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:19.700\n will lead you to stop too early.\n\n2:13:19.700 --> 2:13:23.060\n So like, I think there's something to,\n\n2:13:23.060 --> 2:13:25.860\n whether it's the soul or whether it's like religious stuff,\n\n2:13:25.860 --> 2:13:28.220\n like assuming that there's this thing\n\n2:13:28.220 --> 2:13:30.260\n that you cannot possibly understand\n\n2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:33.300\n is a really good assumption under which to operate\n\n2:13:33.300 --> 2:13:36.060\n and under which to do this first principles kind of thinking\n\n2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:38.060\n because you can just keep digging and keep digging,\n\n2:13:38.060 --> 2:13:40.580\n keep digging even when it seems like you're at the bottom\n\n2:13:40.580 --> 2:13:41.620\n because you don't fucking know\n\n2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:42.900\n if you're at the bottom or not.\n\n2:13:42.900 --> 2:13:46.740\n And back to one of our, I guess our other kind of tangents\n\n2:13:46.740 --> 2:13:49.260\n was that comes back to everyone's a human being.\n\n2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:52.420\n The smartest human being in the history of humanity\n\n2:13:52.420 --> 2:13:57.420\n is so hilariously weak, like short lived and not intelligent.\n\n2:13:57.740 --> 2:13:58.620\n Do it for yourself, bro.\n\n2:13:58.620 --> 2:13:59.460\n I understand.\n\n2:13:59.460 --> 2:14:00.980\n I didn't say, no, I'm not saying comparison to me.\n\n2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:02.860\n In comparison to me, everyone is awesome,\n\n2:14:02.860 --> 2:14:04.980\n but that's why I don't do the goat thing.\n\n2:14:04.980 --> 2:14:09.380\n But basically, it's just on a cosmic level.\n\n2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:10.660\n Can you imagine if you were a vampire,\n\n2:14:10.660 --> 2:14:12.820\n you're like 900 years old, like how much you would seem,\n\n2:14:12.820 --> 2:14:15.940\n you would seem like a lowercase G God to people.\n\n2:14:15.940 --> 2:14:18.580\n You'd be like, how could you know so much?\n\n2:14:18.580 --> 2:14:20.580\n How can you have such a long view perspective?\n\n2:14:20.580 --> 2:14:21.900\n It would be insane.\n\n2:14:21.900 --> 2:14:24.380\n So I mean, it seems like we're talking about AI now, right?\n\n2:14:24.380 --> 2:14:26.580\n Where we're creating things that are infinitely smarter\n\n2:14:26.580 --> 2:14:28.540\n than us effectively and live all this time\n\n2:14:28.540 --> 2:14:31.400\n and it's probably gonna do what we tell it to do, right?\n\n2:14:31.400 --> 2:14:34.380\n No, it's probably, well, I hope it keeps us around.\n\n2:14:34.380 --> 2:14:37.260\n Do you, by the way, think about AI\n\n2:14:37.260 --> 2:14:38.700\n and the existential threats?\n\n2:14:38.700 --> 2:14:43.620\n Like speaking of gods, are you, is this whole\n\n2:14:43.620 --> 2:14:45.900\n technological world, we talked about social networks\n\n2:14:45.900 --> 2:14:49.660\n and this increasing power of technology around us,\n\n2:14:49.660 --> 2:14:51.740\n we ourselves are becoming less human\n\n2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:56.580\n because we keep relying on technology more and more.\n\n2:14:56.580 --> 2:14:59.040\n So we're becoming kinds of cyborgs,\n\n2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:03.760\n but also there's a future that's quite possible\n\n2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:06.780\n where the technology becomes smarter\n\n2:15:06.780 --> 2:15:09.620\n and more powerful than us humans\n\n2:15:09.620 --> 2:15:14.380\n and starts having a life of its own\n\n2:15:14.380 --> 2:15:16.900\n in ways that perhaps we don't imagine as human beings.\n\n2:15:16.900 --> 2:15:20.260\n I don't just mean like two legged robots walking around\n\n2:15:20.260 --> 2:15:22.260\n and being humans, but smarter.\n\n2:15:22.260 --> 2:15:26.700\n I mean like an intelligent life that's beyond\n\n2:15:30.500 --> 2:15:34.780\n and fundamentally different than our human life.\n\n2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:39.780\n It's infinite, it's a new kind of species,\n\n2:15:41.420 --> 2:15:43.860\n not even just a new species, we're talking about systems,\n\n2:15:43.860 --> 2:15:47.460\n but like it lives in the space of information.\n\n2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:50.660\n It lives in a different time scale\n\n2:15:50.660 --> 2:15:53.820\n and a different scale of all sorts, spatial scale.\n\n2:15:53.820 --> 2:15:57.700\n It operate, like we spoke about individuals,\n\n2:15:57.700 --> 2:16:00.100\n it doesn't operate in the sense of a single individual,\n\n2:16:00.100 --> 2:16:02.420\n like it's not embodied.\n\n2:16:02.420 --> 2:16:04.740\n So it's not like a thing that walks around\n\n2:16:04.740 --> 2:16:08.020\n and it like, it looks at stuff and it consumes the world.\n\n2:16:08.020 --> 2:16:11.900\n It's able to do much larger scale sensing\n\n2:16:11.900 --> 2:16:14.620\n of the environment around it, all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:16:14.620 --> 2:16:16.260\n I can barely even try to,\n\n2:16:16.260 --> 2:16:18.060\n I can barely even conceive of what that would be like.\n\n2:16:18.060 --> 2:16:20.560\n Are you scared or are you excited?\n\n2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:23.300\n I don't define scared or excited.\n\n2:16:23.300 --> 2:16:26.060\n I feel like I tend to define them like the same way\n\n2:16:26.060 --> 2:16:29.540\n where I'm like, I guess I'm.\n\n2:16:29.540 --> 2:16:32.220\n Kind of like when before karaoke, it's the same.\n\n2:16:32.220 --> 2:16:33.980\n Well, that's actually kind of my happy place.\n\n2:16:33.980 --> 2:16:35.700\n It's not so much everyone else's.\n\n2:16:35.700 --> 2:16:37.980\n You know, it's a, everyone else is probably, you know,\n\n2:16:37.980 --> 2:16:39.260\n heading for the door at that point.\n\n2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:40.100\n But you know, it's a.\n\n2:16:40.100 --> 2:16:43.580\n While you're doing it or leading up to the karaoke session.\n\n2:16:43.580 --> 2:16:46.220\n Well, it depends whether or not they know it's me.\n\n2:16:46.220 --> 2:16:48.020\n If they know it's me, that's before I start.\n\n2:16:48.020 --> 2:16:49.560\n If they're like, who's that guy?\n\n2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:50.860\n Then they're like halfway through the song,\n\n2:16:50.860 --> 2:16:52.660\n they're already throwing their beer.\n\n2:16:52.660 --> 2:16:54.820\n What categories of song or particular song\n\n2:16:54.820 --> 2:16:57.100\n are we talking about in terms of like your happy place?\n\n2:16:57.100 --> 2:16:58.140\n Oh man, are you kidding me?\n\n2:16:58.140 --> 2:16:59.600\n I mean, obviously, Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\n2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:01.300\n I mean, there's no question because, oh yeah,\n\n2:17:01.300 --> 2:17:02.180\n because I don't have to sing it here.\n\n2:17:02.180 --> 2:17:03.960\n It's that, it's like, remember, can I beat Khabib?\n\n2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:04.800\n Oh yeah, of course.\n\n2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:05.640\n Is he here?\n\n2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:06.460\n No?\n\n2:17:06.460 --> 2:17:07.300\n Yeah, then yeah, yeah.\n\n2:17:07.300 --> 2:17:08.140\n All right, if he's here, is he here?\n\n2:17:08.140 --> 2:17:08.960\n No, then I, no.\n\n2:17:08.960 --> 2:17:12.100\n I have a torn, I have torn feelings about Bohemian Rhapsody\n\n2:17:12.100 --> 2:17:13.900\n because I like the beginning part, the sadness.\n\n2:17:13.900 --> 2:17:16.700\n I like the solo, the heartbreak.\n\n2:17:16.700 --> 2:17:19.380\n But the second part, I understand it, but it's so ridiculous.\n\n2:17:19.380 --> 2:17:20.220\n It gets ridiculous.\n\n2:17:20.220 --> 2:17:21.060\n It's so ridiculous.\n\n2:17:21.060 --> 2:17:21.900\n It ruins it for me.\n\n2:17:21.900 --> 2:17:23.300\n But it's more about flexing on people.\n\n2:17:23.300 --> 2:17:25.140\n I think if you can actually hit that,\n\n2:17:25.140 --> 2:17:26.860\n hit that, you know, the falsetto.\n\n2:17:26.860 --> 2:17:27.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:17:27.700 --> 2:17:30.100\n So it's, it's not, okay.\n\n2:17:30.100 --> 2:17:32.980\n So you appreciate not for the musical beauty\n\n2:17:32.980 --> 2:17:35.220\n and complexity of the song, you just like to flex on people.\n\n2:17:35.220 --> 2:17:36.100\n Cause like for all, yeah.\n\n2:17:36.100 --> 2:17:37.980\n Like what's the purpose of, of anything\n\n2:17:37.980 --> 2:17:39.860\n except for just to let everyone know\n\n2:17:39.860 --> 2:17:41.220\n that you think you're cool.\n\n2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:45.580\n And there's no better way of doing that than karaoke.\n\n2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:47.340\n So I'm not sure why I brought up karaoke.\n\n2:17:47.340 --> 2:17:48.220\n Captive audience.\n\n2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:49.060\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:17:49.060 --> 2:17:51.540\n Oh, about fear and excitement of artificial intelligence.\n\n2:17:51.540 --> 2:17:53.580\n I mean, like, you know me, I don't know anything about,\n\n2:17:53.580 --> 2:17:55.620\n I just, basically I don't,\n\n2:17:55.620 --> 2:17:58.260\n I don't understand the implications of any of this.\n\n2:17:58.260 --> 2:18:00.780\n I would just say that like radically altering\n\n2:18:00.780 --> 2:18:03.220\n what it means to be human in such an unbelievably short\n\n2:18:03.220 --> 2:18:06.120\n period of time just seems like such a crazy thing.\n\n2:18:06.120 --> 2:18:08.140\n And also it's not like we're, I can't remember\n\n2:18:08.140 --> 2:18:08.980\n who said this to me recently.\n\n2:18:08.980 --> 2:18:09.800\n It might've been me.\n\n2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:10.640\n I can't remember.\n\n2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:13.220\n So this is definitely not my idea, but we're,\n\n2:18:13.220 --> 2:18:17.900\n we're not even going, Hey, would you like to opt in everyone?\n\n2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:20.340\n Everyone is being opted in, you know?\n\n2:18:20.340 --> 2:18:21.940\n And particularly when you want to talk about\n\n2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:24.580\n like large scale robotics or large scale AI,\n\n2:18:24.580 --> 2:18:25.820\n like the world is changing.\n\n2:18:25.820 --> 2:18:28.060\n People in Senegal are opting in right now\n\n2:18:28.060 --> 2:18:28.980\n without realizing it.\n\n2:18:28.980 --> 2:18:29.940\n It's not even like, and again,\n\n2:18:29.940 --> 2:18:31.060\n I don't mean to pick on Senegal.\n\n2:18:31.060 --> 2:18:32.660\n It's just whatever country comes up to mind,\n\n2:18:32.660 --> 2:18:33.800\n but that's in the developing world.\n\n2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:36.260\n But basically, you know,\n\n2:18:36.260 --> 2:18:40.800\n recognizing that this huge shift is coming,\n\n2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:42.700\n we have no idea if this is a decent idea.\n\n2:18:42.700 --> 2:18:45.820\n And also something else I've always been considered is,\n\n2:18:45.820 --> 2:18:49.100\n you know, you think about most of the really awful, awful,\n\n2:18:49.100 --> 2:18:51.180\n awful things that have done in history,\n\n2:18:51.180 --> 2:18:54.260\n large scale slavery, holly, you name it.\n\n2:18:54.260 --> 2:18:57.500\n It didn't, people say that it came from this motivation\n\n2:18:57.500 --> 2:18:58.340\n or that motivation.\n\n2:18:58.340 --> 2:18:59.460\n Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.\n\n2:18:59.460 --> 2:19:01.300\n Fundamentally, the issue, at least in my mind,\n\n2:19:01.300 --> 2:19:04.060\n I'm not a historian, power differential.\n\n2:19:05.060 --> 2:19:08.780\n If you and I can't contest, we don't contend.\n\n2:19:08.780 --> 2:19:11.160\n It's not like we fight and you might win or we fight,\n\n2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:12.700\n even you'll win comfortably.\n\n2:19:12.700 --> 2:19:15.940\n It's you are so unbelievably powerful compared to me\n\n2:19:15.940 --> 2:19:18.780\n that there's nothing I can do to stop you.\n\n2:19:18.780 --> 2:19:20.300\n That seems like a recipe for something\n\n2:19:20.300 --> 2:19:22.020\n really, really not great happening.\n\n2:19:22.020 --> 2:19:24.780\n Because if you think about like, you know,\n\n2:19:24.780 --> 2:19:26.540\n European countries encountering each other,\n\n2:19:26.540 --> 2:19:27.360\n and I'm just speculating,\n\n2:19:27.360 --> 2:19:28.200\n I don't know anything about history,\n\n2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:31.060\n let's say countries that can contend with one another\n\n2:19:31.060 --> 2:19:34.260\n versus countries that can't.\n\n2:19:34.260 --> 2:19:37.220\n Let's say an alien species, an alien race shows up,\n\n2:19:37.220 --> 2:19:38.660\n you know, right now, we don't want that.\n\n2:19:38.660 --> 2:19:39.500\n I think Stephen Hawking said that,\n\n2:19:39.500 --> 2:19:41.040\n and it makes perfect sense to me.\n\n2:19:41.040 --> 2:19:41.880\n We don't want that.\n\n2:19:41.880 --> 2:19:44.860\n If you can come here, we better hope you're nice.\n\n2:19:44.860 --> 2:19:46.100\n Because what are we gonna do?\n\n2:19:46.100 --> 2:19:47.900\n What are we gonna hope that you invade the water planet\n\n2:19:47.900 --> 2:19:50.060\n like they did in, you know, what are the,\n\n2:19:50.060 --> 2:19:51.700\n Lord of the, yeah, War of the Worlds.\n\n2:19:51.700 --> 2:19:53.620\n So I guess what I'm trying to get across is like,\n\n2:19:53.620 --> 2:19:56.460\n shocking levels of power differential between groups\n\n2:19:56.460 --> 2:19:59.700\n that makes the world ripe for horrific abuse\n\n2:19:59.700 --> 2:20:01.800\n in the event that someone decides to do it.\n\n2:20:01.800 --> 2:20:04.540\n It's like, like you imagine an adult hitting a child,\n\n2:20:04.540 --> 2:20:05.740\n like hitting, hitting a child,\n\n2:20:05.740 --> 2:20:07.140\n no one in their right mind would ever go like,\n\n2:20:07.140 --> 2:20:08.420\n oh yeah, that's a great idea.\n\n2:20:08.420 --> 2:20:11.380\n Because it's such an, it's so grossly imbalanced.\n\n2:20:11.380 --> 2:20:12.940\n You're like, this is wrong.\n\n2:20:12.940 --> 2:20:14.220\n But it's also on the table\n\n2:20:14.220 --> 2:20:16.340\n only because of the gross imbalance.\n\n2:20:16.340 --> 2:20:18.100\n So I guess to come back, it's like,\n\n2:20:18.100 --> 2:20:21.600\n whether we create AI and it's on some crazy level\n\n2:20:21.600 --> 2:20:24.260\n of its own, or it's I'm in charge of it,\n\n2:20:24.260 --> 2:20:27.580\n or I just, it seems like we're creating,\n\n2:20:27.580 --> 2:20:31.340\n you mentioned like a game theory and nuclear war,\n\n2:20:31.340 --> 2:20:32.860\n what prevented nuclear war?\n\n2:20:32.860 --> 2:20:35.880\n I mean, presumably mutually assured destruction.\n\n2:20:35.880 --> 2:20:38.540\n I mean, hopefully also humanity and the humanity\n\n2:20:38.540 --> 2:20:40.940\n and the reasonable, you know, cooler heads prevailing\n\n2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:43.860\n and going, hey, I can understand the veil of ignorance.\n\n2:20:43.860 --> 2:20:46.140\n And I don't go, oh yeah, let me kill those guys\n\n2:20:46.140 --> 2:20:48.260\n because I can't, I go, this is wrong, period.\n\n2:20:48.260 --> 2:20:51.740\n And in concept, this is not an action I should take,\n\n2:20:51.740 --> 2:20:54.020\n but it's also nice and easy to keep me honest\n\n2:20:54.020 --> 2:20:56.980\n if I know that I can't get you without being got myself.\n\n2:20:56.980 --> 2:21:00.980\n But what happens when I can get anyone anything\n\n2:21:00.980 --> 2:21:02.540\n and I'm more or less untouchable?\n\n2:21:02.540 --> 2:21:05.740\n Like that seems to me to be like various times\n\n2:21:05.740 --> 2:21:07.440\n in colonial history, you know what I mean?\n\n2:21:07.440 --> 2:21:09.540\n And what happened, we know what happened.\n\n2:21:09.540 --> 2:21:14.540\n But so the possibility of really bad things\n\n2:21:14.580 --> 2:21:17.220\n are plentiful, the possibilities.\n\n2:21:17.220 --> 2:21:20.580\n But the possibilities of really positive things\n\n2:21:20.580 --> 2:21:21.420\n are plentiful.\n\n2:21:21.420 --> 2:21:22.380\n Like what though?\n\n2:21:22.380 --> 2:21:23.220\n I'm not saying wrong.\n\n2:21:23.220 --> 2:21:24.060\n I'm just telling you though.\n\n2:21:24.060 --> 2:21:25.700\n So I can give a million examples.\n\n2:21:25.700 --> 2:21:29.260\n One is just the examples of the parent and the child.\n\n2:21:30.300 --> 2:21:34.600\n You said there's a power differential there\n\n2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:39.260\n and we don't like a parent hitting their child.\n\n2:21:39.260 --> 2:21:41.060\n What about not just hitting, like beating?\n\n2:21:41.060 --> 2:21:43.140\n Beating, yeah, great.\n\n2:21:43.140 --> 2:21:44.740\n Beating their child.\n\n2:21:44.740 --> 2:21:49.120\n How often percentage wise do you see that happening?\n\n2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:52.540\n Even though that power differential,\n\n2:21:52.540 --> 2:21:54.980\n first of all, other people's kids,\n\n2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:56.580\n let's just put this on the table.\n\n2:21:56.580 --> 2:21:58.820\n I love kids, but other people's kids\n\n2:21:58.820 --> 2:22:00.540\n can be annoying sometimes.\n\n2:22:00.540 --> 2:22:03.860\n Sometimes you gotta deal out some justice, I get it.\n\n2:22:03.860 --> 2:22:06.180\n But we don't practice, we don't take advantage\n\n2:22:06.180 --> 2:22:07.740\n of that power differential.\n\n2:22:07.740 --> 2:22:11.600\n So like there is ethics, there's moralities that emerge\n\n2:22:11.600 --> 2:22:15.380\n that allow the power differential to be used for good\n\n2:22:15.380 --> 2:22:16.640\n versus for bad.\n\n2:22:16.640 --> 2:22:20.660\n So like one of the assumptions with Stephen Hawking\n\n2:22:20.660 --> 2:22:24.860\n or with if Russia became much more powerful than America\n\n2:22:24.860 --> 2:22:28.140\n or America much more powerful than Russia in the Cold War,\n\n2:22:28.140 --> 2:22:31.140\n your assumption that immediately that power differential,\n\n2:22:31.140 --> 2:22:33.140\n not your assumption, but it would express itself\n\n2:22:33.140 --> 2:22:36.900\n would express itself in the same way\n\n2:22:36.900 --> 2:22:38.460\n that it was trying to express itself\n\n2:22:38.460 --> 2:22:41.500\n when there was a more level competition.\n\n2:22:41.500 --> 2:22:44.320\n But it's also possible when the power differential grows,\n\n2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:47.580\n the incentive, the joy, whatever the mechanisms\n\n2:22:47.580 --> 2:22:51.820\n that made sense when it was at the same level,\n\n2:22:51.820 --> 2:22:54.260\n the incentives become very different.\n\n2:22:54.260 --> 2:22:56.980\n It's not as fun to destroy the ant colony.\n\n2:22:56.980 --> 2:23:01.420\n You start becoming more the kind of a conservationalist.\n\n2:23:01.420 --> 2:23:04.060\n One hopes, that's an evolved perspective though, yeah?\n\n2:23:04.060 --> 2:23:06.100\n Well, I don't know if it's evolved or not,\n\n2:23:06.100 --> 2:23:07.460\n but it's definitely a possibility.\n\n2:23:07.460 --> 2:23:10.300\n It's unclear to me that something that's many orders\n\n2:23:10.300 --> 2:23:14.700\n of magnitude more powerful than us will want to destroy us.\n\n2:23:14.700 --> 2:23:18.420\n Well, I mean, how did mass slavery occur?\n\n2:23:18.420 --> 2:23:22.380\n How did, you know, like just big dogs playing with not?\n\n2:23:22.380 --> 2:23:27.380\n I think slavery and a lot of the atrocities in history\n\n2:23:29.660 --> 2:23:32.780\n happened when the power differential was not as great\n\n2:23:32.780 --> 2:23:35.820\n as we're talking about with AI potentially.\n\n2:23:35.820 --> 2:23:38.500\n Is that not somehow worse then?\n\n2:23:38.500 --> 2:23:39.420\n It's not obvious to me.\n\n2:23:39.420 --> 2:23:42.220\n It's not obvious that things that are way more powerful.\n\n2:23:43.180 --> 2:23:44.020\n That's fair, okay.\n\n2:23:44.020 --> 2:23:45.380\n So I think you're.\n\n2:23:45.380 --> 2:23:47.700\n I guess, how do you restrain it though?\n\n2:23:47.700 --> 2:23:50.180\n There's a lot of different discussions of how to.\n\n2:23:51.380 --> 2:23:52.300\n I guess even restrain each other.\n\n2:23:52.300 --> 2:23:54.180\n Cause let's say I go and decide to strike someone's child,\n\n2:23:54.180 --> 2:23:55.900\n which I'd like to think I wouldn't do.\n\n2:23:55.900 --> 2:23:59.380\n I will be promptly, I will find myself in front of a judge.\n\n2:23:59.380 --> 2:24:01.060\n And so I feel like there's a lot.\n\n2:24:01.060 --> 2:24:03.460\n Can you imagine how many people used to get murdered\n\n2:24:03.460 --> 2:24:04.420\n just in the woods?\n\n2:24:04.420 --> 2:24:05.260\n Yeah.\n\n2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:08.100\n I mean, I would just presume it's a lot, you know?\n\n2:24:08.100 --> 2:24:10.980\n And I don't think most people are lunatics like that,\n\n2:24:10.980 --> 2:24:11.820\n but I would just say.\n\n2:24:11.820 --> 2:24:12.660\n But that's the point.\n\n2:24:12.660 --> 2:24:14.220\n Given though, if you're given to that,\n\n2:24:14.220 --> 2:24:17.220\n your ability to get away with it was greater in the past\n\n2:24:17.220 --> 2:24:19.620\n because of chance of detection was less.\n\n2:24:19.620 --> 2:24:21.420\n So that doesn't, I don't know.\n\n2:24:21.420 --> 2:24:22.260\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:24:22.260 --> 2:24:24.460\n This is what that's called in artificial intelligence,\n\n2:24:24.460 --> 2:24:29.140\n AI safety research called value alignment of ensuring\n\n2:24:29.140 --> 2:24:32.380\n as you build the systems that become smarter and smarter\n\n2:24:32.380 --> 2:24:33.940\n and more powerful and powerful,\n\n2:24:33.940 --> 2:24:38.260\n make sure that their values are aligned with the entities\n\n2:24:38.260 --> 2:24:40.580\n over which they're becoming powerful with humans.\n\n2:24:40.580 --> 2:24:43.900\n So if you were to talk to an AI that's becoming smarter,\n\n2:24:43.900 --> 2:24:45.100\n at first it's dumber than you,\n\n2:24:45.100 --> 2:24:47.460\n but then it's becoming smarter and smarter.\n\n2:24:47.460 --> 2:24:50.540\n You have to create mechanisms\n\n2:24:50.540 --> 2:24:52.620\n where you both value the same things.\n\n2:24:52.620 --> 2:24:54.020\n I guess one thing I wonder,\n\n2:24:54.020 --> 2:24:57.660\n so I guess I'm probably not like sharp enough to grasp this\n\n2:24:57.660 --> 2:25:00.220\n if I'm honest, but I guess like, I wonder like,\n\n2:25:00.220 --> 2:25:01.580\n I used to do chess programs.\n\n2:25:01.580 --> 2:25:02.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:25:02.820 --> 2:25:04.980\n You know, it was Deep Blue, Stockfish,\n\n2:25:04.980 --> 2:25:07.980\n and then like AlphaZero and AlphaZero teaching itself\n\n2:25:07.980 --> 2:25:12.140\n to beat Stockfish without any help in four hours.\n\n2:25:12.140 --> 2:25:12.980\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:25:12.980 --> 2:25:15.860\n Like it becomes orders of magnitude more intelligence\n\n2:25:15.860 --> 2:25:19.300\n than us in effectively in instantaneous period.\n\n2:25:19.300 --> 2:25:20.540\n I guess what I always wondered,\n\n2:25:20.540 --> 2:25:23.180\n like if you were that much smarter than me,\n\n2:25:24.580 --> 2:25:26.220\n I feel like your ability to manipulate me\n\n2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:28.540\n would be pretty significant or at least potentially, no?\n\n2:25:28.540 --> 2:25:33.540\n But manipulation implies that the incentive is\n\n2:25:34.660 --> 2:25:37.540\n to overpower everything around you.\n\n2:25:37.540 --> 2:25:39.620\n Like there's implied incentives.\n\n2:25:39.620 --> 2:25:43.300\n If your value is to actually, like,\n\n2:25:45.620 --> 2:25:47.460\n it depends what you want in life.\n\n2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:48.300\n Okay.\n\n2:25:48.300 --> 2:25:49.620\n What you want in your system.\n\n2:25:49.620 --> 2:25:53.060\n It's not clear that the goal of an AI system\n\n2:25:53.060 --> 2:25:55.940\n that's all powerful is to destroy all humans.\n\n2:25:55.940 --> 2:25:57.700\n No, I don't think that it is either.\n\n2:25:57.700 --> 2:25:58.540\n I guess what I'm...\n\n2:25:58.540 --> 2:26:00.460\n Or even enslave all humans.\n\n2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:01.300\n That's fair.\n\n2:26:01.300 --> 2:26:02.340\n I guess what I'm trying to suggest\n\n2:26:02.340 --> 2:26:04.580\n is that something adequately powerful,\n\n2:26:04.580 --> 2:26:06.580\n these actions are on the table.\n\n2:26:06.580 --> 2:26:08.340\n Yes, they're on the table and that's scary.\n\n2:26:08.340 --> 2:26:10.500\n And that's why a lot of people are really concerned about it\n\n2:26:10.500 --> 2:26:12.020\n and are working on it.\n\n2:26:12.020 --> 2:26:15.060\n I'm just trying to make the case for AGI\n\n2:26:15.060 --> 2:26:19.980\n because if they're watching this, he's the one to kill.\n\n2:26:19.980 --> 2:26:23.420\n No, actually I was thinking, I was, yeah.\n\n2:26:23.420 --> 2:26:26.020\n I wash toilets like really well.\n\n2:26:28.100 --> 2:26:30.300\n No, I mean, that's the main concern\n\n2:26:30.300 --> 2:26:32.580\n for all the people in the AI state to research.\n\n2:26:32.580 --> 2:26:34.740\n People talk about AGI is,\n\n2:26:34.740 --> 2:26:39.740\n it's kind of disturbing how little people are working\n\n2:26:40.700 --> 2:26:44.700\n on trying to create mechanisms\n\n2:26:44.700 --> 2:26:48.300\n that keep AI's values aligned with ours.\n\n2:26:48.300 --> 2:26:50.620\n That's completely unshocking.\n\n2:26:50.620 --> 2:26:53.460\n Yeah, we humans seem to do only good\n\n2:26:53.460 --> 2:26:57.820\n when like, you know, you even look at like coronavirus.\n\n2:26:57.820 --> 2:27:02.020\n It's like when, like the water has to be leaking\n\n2:27:02.020 --> 2:27:03.020\n from the ceiling.\n\n2:27:03.020 --> 2:27:05.860\n You have to be, there has to be blood everywhere,\n\n2:27:05.860 --> 2:27:08.700\n fire, just destruction.\n\n2:27:08.700 --> 2:27:12.660\n We just seem to ignore completely any trouble.\n\n2:27:12.660 --> 2:27:13.980\n Writing all over the wall.\n\n2:27:13.980 --> 2:27:15.660\n Writing all over the wall.\n\n2:27:15.660 --> 2:27:16.500\n This is fine.\n\n2:27:16.500 --> 2:27:19.180\n Yeah, I'm sure nothing to see here, we'll be okay.\n\n2:27:19.180 --> 2:27:21.300\n But we do all right, especially in the United States.\n\n2:27:21.300 --> 2:27:25.860\n You figure out even when it becomes a really serious problem,\n\n2:27:25.860 --> 2:27:27.940\n taking actions last minute,\n\n2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:30.860\n there's something about the innovative spirit\n\n2:27:30.860 --> 2:27:34.020\n that results in a solution last minute,\n\n2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:35.380\n right before the deadline.\n\n2:27:35.380 --> 2:27:36.220\n It works out.\n\n2:27:36.220 --> 2:27:37.820\n Well, I mean, I don't know how you did school,\n\n2:27:37.820 --> 2:27:38.660\n probably a lot better than me.\n\n2:27:38.660 --> 2:27:40.380\n No, that's exactly how I did school.\n\n2:27:40.380 --> 2:27:42.100\n I couldn't be more, I was no motivation up\n\n2:27:42.100 --> 2:27:43.420\n until like the last, if you're like,\n\n2:27:43.420 --> 2:27:46.740\n we have 22 hours to do the entire semesters of work.\n\n2:27:46.740 --> 2:27:48.060\n Like, let's do this.\n\n2:27:48.060 --> 2:27:48.900\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:48.900 --> 2:27:51.660\n And you get like 19 fricking Mountain Dews and then, yeah.\n\n2:27:51.660 --> 2:27:53.900\n Well, that's why you and I are failures in life\n\n2:27:53.900 --> 2:27:56.700\n because I just talked to, I mentioned Cal Newport\n\n2:27:56.700 --> 2:28:00.860\n with his book, Deep Work and so on.\n\n2:28:00.860 --> 2:28:03.380\n He is of the variety of these creatures\n\n2:28:03.380 --> 2:28:06.980\n that basically does everything ahead of time.\n\n2:28:06.980 --> 2:28:07.820\n That's shocking.\n\n2:28:07.820 --> 2:28:12.820\n Because he dislikes the, he thinks it's unproductive\n\n2:28:13.980 --> 2:28:17.780\n to experience the stress and anxiety of the deadline\n\n2:28:17.780 --> 2:28:21.980\n because you're not going to be your best performance wise\n\n2:28:21.980 --> 2:28:23.900\n and you're not going to do the best work.\n\n2:28:23.900 --> 2:28:27.060\n So it doesn't make any, it's completely irrational\n\n2:28:27.060 --> 2:28:29.300\n to a function based on the deadline.\n\n2:28:29.300 --> 2:28:31.820\n You should have a system, a process that gets stuff,\n\n2:28:31.820 --> 2:28:33.660\n a little bit of stuff done every day.\n\n2:28:33.660 --> 2:28:37.580\n So like you should be, and constantly be systematically\n\n2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:38.620\n honest with yourself.\n\n2:28:38.620 --> 2:28:40.900\n If you say, I'm going to get this stuff done today\n\n2:28:40.900 --> 2:28:42.860\n and this week, at the end of the day,\n\n2:28:42.860 --> 2:28:44.900\n at the end of the week, you have to then reflect\n\n2:28:44.900 --> 2:28:48.220\n on what you did, what you planned and improve that plan,\n\n2:28:48.220 --> 2:28:50.580\n update it constantly, update every day, every week,\n\n2:28:50.580 --> 2:28:53.900\n every quarter, whatever those durations are.\n\n2:28:53.900 --> 2:28:55.940\n As I'm listening to this and reading his stuff,\n\n2:28:55.940 --> 2:28:58.020\n it's like, oh, yeah, I agree with everything.\n\n2:28:58.020 --> 2:29:00.060\n I'm like, yes, I'm clapping.\n\n2:29:00.060 --> 2:29:02.180\n But like the reality is, and then I go back\n\n2:29:02.180 --> 2:29:05.100\n and just eat Cheetos and like, don't do shit\n\n2:29:05.100 --> 2:29:05.940\n until like the last minute.\n\n2:29:05.940 --> 2:29:07.340\n It ain't meant to be cheesy.\n\n2:29:10.180 --> 2:29:11.820\n Actually, I don't eat Cheetos, but yes.\n\n2:29:11.820 --> 2:29:15.660\n But actually, again, not that it's ever going to matter\n\n2:29:15.660 --> 2:29:17.900\n because he's so shockingly productive and well thought out\n\n2:29:17.900 --> 2:29:19.420\n that whatever I've decided to think about\n\n2:29:19.420 --> 2:29:20.780\n trying to monkey wrench in there\n\n2:29:20.780 --> 2:29:22.940\n is definitely going to be able to deal with.\n\n2:29:22.940 --> 2:29:24.980\n But it's funny that again, because you're a human being,\n\n2:29:24.980 --> 2:29:26.580\n not a God, all of your strengths\n\n2:29:26.580 --> 2:29:28.580\n are you have a corresponding weakness.\n\n2:29:28.580 --> 2:29:30.540\n The less you practice working under the gun,\n\n2:29:30.540 --> 2:29:32.580\n the less comfortable you are working under the gun.\n\n2:29:32.580 --> 2:29:34.220\n The more practice you have working under the gun,\n\n2:29:34.220 --> 2:29:35.060\n the better you get at it.\n\n2:29:35.060 --> 2:29:36.900\n The downside is you're always working under the gun.\n\n2:29:36.900 --> 2:29:39.180\n So you're less productive or it's like your work quality\n\n2:29:39.180 --> 2:29:40.100\n maybe drops.\n\n2:29:40.100 --> 2:29:41.180\n So it's an interesting thing.\n\n2:29:41.180 --> 2:29:43.220\n It's like, it's almost like, hey, I wonder if this,\n\n2:29:43.220 --> 2:29:45.660\n I wonder if Khabib Nurmagomedov has a lot of heart\n\n2:29:45.660 --> 2:29:47.780\n and I try to say the answer is almost certainly yes,\n\n2:29:47.780 --> 2:29:49.860\n but you go, well, he hasn't struggled a bunch.\n\n2:29:49.860 --> 2:29:51.420\n Maybe he doesn't struggle well.\n\n2:29:51.420 --> 2:29:53.300\n And it just so happens that he can also work under the gun\n\n2:29:53.300 --> 2:29:55.060\n really well, he just doesn't like to do it.\n\n2:29:55.060 --> 2:29:56.700\n But yeah, but it's an interesting thing.\n\n2:29:56.700 --> 2:29:57.740\n It's like, I guess, what is it?\n\n2:29:57.740 --> 2:29:59.580\n The Aristotle, we are what we repeatedly do.\n\n2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:02.940\n We are all, we're all practicing something all the time.\n\n2:30:02.940 --> 2:30:04.100\n So I guess it's, it's funny.\n\n2:30:04.100 --> 2:30:05.420\n I guess that's the question that I have though.\n\n2:30:05.420 --> 2:30:08.100\n I would love to ask him, it'd be really neat\n\n2:30:08.100 --> 2:30:10.940\n is in certain jobs.\n\n2:30:10.940 --> 2:30:13.260\n I mean, obviously you want to have preparation always,\n\n2:30:13.260 --> 2:30:16.340\n always, but certain things have like a degree of like\n\n2:30:16.340 --> 2:30:19.140\n entropy in the system and you go,\n\n2:30:19.140 --> 2:30:21.740\n I need to practice working under the gun.\n\n2:30:21.740 --> 2:30:22.940\n And I'm not saying that's what I need to do\n\n2:30:22.940 --> 2:30:24.860\n because the fighting, it should be for the most part,\n\n2:30:24.860 --> 2:30:26.180\n it's a really sterile environment.\n\n2:30:26.180 --> 2:30:27.020\n In the grand scheme of things,\n\n2:30:27.020 --> 2:30:28.700\n like fighting in a cage is very sterile\n\n2:30:28.700 --> 2:30:30.660\n compared to most other things in life, right?\n\n2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:32.940\n But dangerous, but sterile.\n\n2:30:32.940 --> 2:30:35.420\n And unless of course, like, you know,\n\n2:30:35.420 --> 2:30:37.500\n like the other guy, the ref decides to hit you,\n\n2:30:37.500 --> 2:30:38.340\n which would be hilarious.\n\n2:30:38.340 --> 2:30:40.500\n But anyway, I guess just going like, okay,\n\n2:30:40.500 --> 2:30:45.220\n so at what value do you get out of adding a degree of,\n\n2:30:45.220 --> 2:30:47.580\n let's say you could even be planned by someone else,\n\n2:30:47.580 --> 2:30:49.900\n but junk in the system.\n\n2:30:49.900 --> 2:30:52.020\n And you just have to work under the gun to make it happen.\n\n2:30:52.020 --> 2:30:53.460\n Let's say for instance, for like police\n\n2:30:53.460 --> 2:30:56.140\n or something like that, the situation turns left hard\n\n2:30:56.140 --> 2:30:57.860\n at some random point in time.\n\n2:30:57.860 --> 2:31:00.020\n And that could happen to any number of people.\n\n2:31:00.020 --> 2:31:01.940\n So I guess it's interesting things that allow\n\n2:31:01.940 --> 2:31:04.020\n for perfect planning or quasi perfect planning\n\n2:31:04.020 --> 2:31:06.420\n versus things that are inherently unstable.\n\n2:31:06.420 --> 2:31:07.580\n And then what are the,\n\n2:31:07.580 --> 2:31:10.780\n what's the psychological fallout of comfort with that?\n\n2:31:10.780 --> 2:31:12.340\n Because I think a lot of people that are really comfortable\n\n2:31:12.340 --> 2:31:15.620\n under the gun, let it happen a lot.\n\n2:31:15.620 --> 2:31:17.340\n For all the good and the bad of that, does that make sense?\n\n2:31:17.340 --> 2:31:18.620\n No, that totally makes sense.\n\n2:31:18.620 --> 2:31:20.940\n And it was, I mean, his answer would be\n\n2:31:20.940 --> 2:31:23.780\n that you have to be honest with yourself\n\n2:31:23.780 --> 2:31:26.660\n if it's valuable for your success\n\n2:31:26.660 --> 2:31:29.140\n to practice being under the gun.\n\n2:31:29.140 --> 2:31:30.900\n And then you should schedule that.\n\n2:31:30.900 --> 2:31:31.980\n Yeah, then he's smart.\n\n2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:34.460\n You should plan that, you should systematically.\n\n2:31:34.460 --> 2:31:37.020\n And then as opposed to doing it half assedly,\n\n2:31:37.020 --> 2:31:39.740\n because it's, as opposed to letting the environment\n\n2:31:39.740 --> 2:31:43.460\n choose the randomness, like control the randomness\n\n2:31:43.460 --> 2:31:46.060\n to where like you optimize it.\n\n2:31:46.060 --> 2:31:48.140\n I wish it's so efficient, it's shocking\n\n2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:49.060\n just to hear about it.\n\n2:31:49.060 --> 2:31:52.620\n Yeah, no, he's, I mean, the same way you are,\n\n2:31:52.620 --> 2:31:53.700\n he's annoying in the same way,\n\n2:31:53.700 --> 2:31:56.460\n which is like he drops truth bombs.\n\n2:31:56.460 --> 2:31:59.500\n It's like, yeah, yeah, that's so true.\n\n2:31:59.500 --> 2:32:02.740\n Yeah, we're probably comparably doing that.\n\n2:32:02.740 --> 2:32:03.580\n No, he does.\n\n2:32:05.140 --> 2:32:07.780\n But he's, so he, his profession requires that.\n\n2:32:07.780 --> 2:32:09.860\n So he's not just like a motivational speaker or whatever.\n\n2:32:09.860 --> 2:32:14.300\n He's a theoretical computer scientist\n\n2:32:14.300 --> 2:32:18.060\n and he needs the long hours in the day\n\n2:32:18.060 --> 2:32:19.780\n of doing like serious math.\n\n2:32:19.780 --> 2:32:21.540\n So it's mostly math proofs.\n\n2:32:21.540 --> 2:32:24.860\n And for that, you have to sit and think really deeply.\n\n2:32:24.860 --> 2:32:26.300\n It's like really hard work.\n\n2:32:26.300 --> 2:32:28.540\n Compared to like what most people do,\n\n2:32:28.540 --> 2:32:31.260\n like even what I, I mean, what I do,\n\n2:32:31.260 --> 2:32:34.580\n like programming is way easier than rigorous math proofs.\n\n2:32:34.580 --> 2:32:37.820\n Cause you have to basically have this machine\n\n2:32:37.820 --> 2:32:42.540\n and you have to, your brain to churn out logic\n\n2:32:43.580 --> 2:32:46.260\n in a focused way while visualizing a bunch of things\n\n2:32:46.260 --> 2:32:47.780\n and holding that in your brain\n\n2:32:47.780 --> 2:32:50.660\n and holding that for 10 minutes, 20 minutes,\n\n2:32:50.660 --> 2:32:52.660\n hopefully several hours.\n\n2:32:52.660 --> 2:32:55.180\n And you're not just like doing homework.\n\n2:32:55.180 --> 2:32:56.860\n You're doing totally novel stuff.\n\n2:32:56.860 --> 2:32:59.020\n So like stuff that nobody's ever done before.\n\n2:32:59.020 --> 2:33:00.820\n So you keep running up against the wall\n\n2:33:00.820 --> 2:33:02.700\n of like, fuck, this is a den.\n\n2:33:02.700 --> 2:33:05.420\n And oh no, wait, is this a dead end?\n\n2:33:05.420 --> 2:33:09.340\n And like that whole frustration, that's serious mental work.\n\n2:33:09.340 --> 2:33:11.220\n That's like incredibly difficult mental work.\n\n2:33:11.220 --> 2:33:13.300\n So he knows what he's talking about.\n\n2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:14.140\n It's amazing.\n\n2:33:14.140 --> 2:33:16.460\n But like you said, he's like, this seems like the standard\n\n2:33:16.460 --> 2:33:19.500\n for the quality of work that he needs is so high\n\n2:33:19.500 --> 2:33:21.340\n that almost anything less than this level\n\n2:33:21.340 --> 2:33:24.260\n of systematization and organization would preclude it.\n\n2:33:24.260 --> 2:33:25.100\n Right?\n\n2:33:25.100 --> 2:33:26.340\n So he can't afford the kind of bullshit\n\n2:33:26.340 --> 2:33:28.740\n that I don't know about you, but that certainly I do,\n\n2:33:28.740 --> 2:33:30.780\n which is like last deadline kind of stuff.\n\n2:33:30.780 --> 2:33:34.420\n Cause you can't do that kind of work last minute\n\n2:33:34.420 --> 2:33:35.780\n on deadline kind of stuff.\n\n2:33:35.780 --> 2:33:39.060\n So my question for him in general is like,\n\n2:33:39.060 --> 2:33:41.700\n and for you and I is like, well,\n\n2:33:41.700 --> 2:33:44.340\n here's these negative patterns that we do\n\n2:33:45.380 --> 2:33:48.020\n of like doing shit last minute and so on.\n\n2:33:49.140 --> 2:33:51.140\n Is this just who we are now?\n\n2:33:51.140 --> 2:33:52.580\n Or are there some?\n\n2:33:52.580 --> 2:33:54.980\n I don't think I'm really big into a free will.\n\n2:33:54.980 --> 2:33:57.940\n You know, I was thinking that it's mostly predestination,\n\n2:33:57.940 --> 2:33:59.420\n at least in this regard.\n\n2:33:59.420 --> 2:34:00.780\n It's the same with like communism.\n\n2:34:00.780 --> 2:34:04.060\n Like, as long as it fits my, whatever is the lazy thing\n\n2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:06.380\n to do, I'll just not believe in free will.\n\n2:34:06.380 --> 2:34:10.620\n I'm not a communism opportunist or that's when that was.\n\n2:34:10.620 --> 2:34:15.620\n I'm an opportunistic communist and capitalist.\n\n2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:18.100\n I just do whatever, whatever is cool at the time.\n\n2:34:18.100 --> 2:34:19.420\n Exactly.\n\n2:34:19.420 --> 2:34:24.420\n Let me ask you to examine some fundamental principles\n\n2:34:24.660 --> 2:34:27.220\n of a particular thing that Joe Rogan brought up to me\n\n2:34:27.220 --> 2:34:29.020\n several times online and offline.\n\n2:34:29.020 --> 2:34:29.860\n Okay.\n\n2:34:29.860 --> 2:34:34.860\n Which is that he thinks that the tie that I wear\n\n2:34:35.780 --> 2:34:40.500\n is something that makes me vulnerable to attack\n\n2:34:40.500 --> 2:34:44.060\n that you should be, the reason he doesn't wear a tie\n\n2:34:44.060 --> 2:34:47.060\n is because he can get choked very easily with a tie.\n\n2:34:47.060 --> 2:34:48.620\n It's a big concern.\n\n2:34:48.620 --> 2:34:52.300\n Okay, my contention, and by the way,\n\n2:34:52.300 --> 2:34:54.420\n he wore a suit last time too.\n\n2:34:54.420 --> 2:34:55.620\n He didn't wear it on the podcast.\n\n2:34:55.620 --> 2:34:57.180\n He wore it for dinner later.\n\n2:34:57.180 --> 2:34:58.300\n Yeah, I wore a suit the other day\n\n2:34:58.300 --> 2:35:00.180\n and I had no socks on.\n\n2:35:00.180 --> 2:35:01.580\n I didn't realize, yeah.\n\n2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:02.700\n You're supposed to wear socks?\n\n2:35:02.700 --> 2:35:03.860\n Yeah, that's my understanding.\n\n2:35:03.860 --> 2:35:04.780\n Why'd you wear a suit?\n\n2:35:04.780 --> 2:35:05.620\n Did you go to court?\n\n2:35:05.620 --> 2:35:07.660\n No, no, not in that, no.\n\n2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:11.180\n Hey, I don't know, I just wanted to play.\n\n2:35:11.180 --> 2:35:13.140\n I wanted to pretend I was an adult for a day.\n\n2:35:13.140 --> 2:35:14.060\n Okay, cool.\n\n2:35:14.060 --> 2:35:18.580\n So my contention is like the jacket,\n\n2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:22.860\n everything is more dangerous than a tie.\n\n2:35:22.860 --> 2:35:24.100\n That's kind of where I was going with that.\n\n2:35:24.100 --> 2:35:25.780\n That's kind of where, yeah, it was my first thought too.\n\n2:35:25.780 --> 2:35:28.660\n Like once the tie becomes an issue, like, yeah.\n\n2:35:28.660 --> 2:35:30.060\n I feel like everything else is already an issue.\n\n2:35:30.060 --> 2:35:31.460\n It's already an issue, yeah.\n\n2:35:31.460 --> 2:35:34.500\n Because the tie to me, now without like messing with it now,\n\n2:35:34.500 --> 2:35:38.900\n is to me has some of the similar problems\n\n2:35:38.900 --> 2:35:40.620\n that a belt does.\n\n2:35:40.620 --> 2:35:42.060\n So like, for example, I don't know about you,\n\n2:35:42.060 --> 2:35:43.460\n maybe you can correct me,\n\n2:35:43.460 --> 2:35:47.020\n but I'm not sure you can use the belt as tied.\n\n2:35:50.340 --> 2:35:53.540\n I know there's some kind of guards\n\n2:35:53.540 --> 2:35:55.700\n you can probably utilize the belt with,\n\n2:35:55.700 --> 2:35:58.780\n but the belt, sorry, when it's tied around the waist.\n\n2:35:58.780 --> 2:36:00.660\n Are you talking about a belt belt or a gi belt?\n\n2:36:00.660 --> 2:36:01.500\n Sorry, gi belt.\n\n2:36:01.500 --> 2:36:02.340\n Okay. Sorry.\n\n2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:04.420\n Gi belt, importantly, gi belt.\n\n2:36:04.420 --> 2:36:09.420\n It's not that great of a thing to use in most cases,\n\n2:36:09.900 --> 2:36:12.060\n I would say, because it slides.\n\n2:36:12.060 --> 2:36:13.140\n Yep, that's true.\n\n2:36:13.140 --> 2:36:18.140\n It doesn't, you can probably invent a few interesting ways\n\n2:36:18.420 --> 2:36:21.300\n to use it as leverage, as control and so on,\n\n2:36:21.300 --> 2:36:24.980\n but there's just so many more things around the gi belt\n\n2:36:24.980 --> 2:36:26.340\n that are better.\n\n2:36:26.340 --> 2:36:28.900\n And so for me, the tie, what people don't realize.\n\n2:36:28.900 --> 2:36:29.740\n That's better.\n\n2:36:29.740 --> 2:36:30.780\n Are we trying to sell a DVD here\n\n2:36:30.780 --> 2:36:32.780\n and have some widgets and bells and whistles?\n\n2:36:32.780 --> 2:36:33.620\n Because in that case,\n\n2:36:33.620 --> 2:36:35.220\n the belt is really important part of what we do.\n\n2:36:35.220 --> 2:36:37.700\n And I would really encourage you guys to look into it.\n\n2:36:37.700 --> 2:36:40.500\n If we're trying to actually like learn something and say,\n\n2:36:40.500 --> 2:36:42.740\n like you said, we're surrounded by better options.\n\n2:36:42.740 --> 2:36:43.580\n Well, that's the thing.\n\n2:36:43.580 --> 2:36:46.420\n I mean, it's not obvious to me that the belt,\n\n2:36:46.420 --> 2:36:48.260\n maybe there's actually undiscovered things\n\n2:36:48.260 --> 2:36:49.980\n about using the belt.\n\n2:36:49.980 --> 2:36:52.340\n I think people have used like putting a foot\n\n2:36:52.340 --> 2:36:55.580\n inside the belt somehow, inside the gi belt.\n\n2:36:55.580 --> 2:36:57.580\n This is a no punches, gi grappling situation.\n\n2:36:57.580 --> 2:36:58.420\n Yes.\n\n2:36:58.420 --> 2:36:59.260\n I guess so.\n\n2:36:59.260 --> 2:37:00.100\n Sort of fairly contrived, right?\n\n2:37:00.100 --> 2:37:01.820\n But with punches too, like, is there,\n\n2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:04.100\n okay, let's talk about a street fights with a belt\n\n2:37:04.100 --> 2:37:06.700\n that's like a jeans belt, like a belt, clothing belt.\n\n2:37:06.700 --> 2:37:07.820\n Okay, so I get to take it off\n\n2:37:07.820 --> 2:37:10.380\n and whip them in the face with the buckle?\n\n2:37:10.380 --> 2:37:11.540\n How serious is this street fight?\n\n2:37:11.540 --> 2:37:12.900\n Are we talking like that far and open?\n\n2:37:12.900 --> 2:37:13.740\n No, 100% serious.\n\n2:37:13.740 --> 2:37:15.140\n Or are we talking like, oh, okay.\n\n2:37:15.140 --> 2:37:17.340\n No, like death, like one of you has to die.\n\n2:37:17.340 --> 2:37:18.420\n Oh, yikes, whoa.\n\n2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:19.260\n Okay.\n\n2:37:19.260 --> 2:37:20.820\n Oh, you ever, like.\n\n2:37:20.820 --> 2:37:22.420\n I'm in this situation all the time.\n\n2:37:22.420 --> 2:37:23.260\n I understand.\n\n2:37:23.260 --> 2:37:26.220\n And there's a reason I'm still here.\n\n2:37:26.220 --> 2:37:28.420\n I had something, I had somebody try to fight me\n\n2:37:28.420 --> 2:37:29.260\n to Starbucks the other day.\n\n2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:30.860\n I fight kids, we're talking about power differential.\n\n2:37:30.860 --> 2:37:31.700\n Yeah, hey.\n\n2:37:31.700 --> 2:37:32.540\n I just beat up kids all the time.\n\n2:37:32.540 --> 2:37:34.500\n Just pick the easy W's, you gotta get the easy W's\n\n2:37:34.500 --> 2:37:35.340\n if you want the hard ones.\n\n2:37:35.340 --> 2:37:36.380\n I'm undefeated.\n\n2:37:36.380 --> 2:37:37.860\n Come around the playground, watch what happens.\n\n2:37:37.860 --> 2:37:41.500\n No, like to the death, what is their clothing\n\n2:37:41.500 --> 2:37:43.940\n that's useful, you know?\n\n2:37:43.940 --> 2:37:44.780\n From my perspective.\n\n2:37:44.780 --> 2:37:46.780\n You mean like for your use or their use?\n\n2:37:46.780 --> 2:37:48.860\n Both, my use, their use.\n\n2:37:48.860 --> 2:37:52.660\n No, like I like how you wanted to take the belt off\n\n2:37:52.660 --> 2:37:54.140\n and use the buckle to hit them with.\n\n2:37:54.140 --> 2:37:56.740\n But first of all, how are you gonna take off the belt?\n\n2:37:56.740 --> 2:38:00.300\n Well, there's a lot of effort involved in unclothing.\n\n2:38:00.300 --> 2:38:02.420\n Well, what I was figuring was when they started\n\n2:38:02.420 --> 2:38:04.060\n to see me take my pants off in the fight,\n\n2:38:04.060 --> 2:38:04.980\n they were like, what?\n\n2:38:04.980 --> 2:38:07.820\n They're gonna pause and rethink the situation for a second?\n\n2:38:07.820 --> 2:38:08.660\n Yes.\n\n2:38:08.660 --> 2:38:09.500\n And I'm making dead eye contact, obviously,\n\n2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:10.500\n this is going on.\n\n2:38:10.500 --> 2:38:12.020\n Yeah, exactly, nodding.\n\n2:38:12.020 --> 2:38:13.460\n And then, you know, by the time they realized\n\n2:38:13.460 --> 2:38:15.820\n you took a belt off until you could whip them with it,\n\n2:38:15.820 --> 2:38:18.780\n you actually, you're already one, possibly two steps ahead.\n\n2:38:18.780 --> 2:38:21.180\n Okay, so fine, let's not talk about your own clothing,\n\n2:38:21.180 --> 2:38:22.020\n let's talk about their clothing.\n\n2:38:22.020 --> 2:38:23.580\n Okay, I'll take off their belt and hit them with it.\n\n2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:25.380\n No, but that's much harder to do.\n\n2:38:25.380 --> 2:38:26.820\n No question, but if you can do it.\n\n2:38:26.820 --> 2:38:29.100\n Oh, I'm maintaining, I can, no, I just said.\n\n2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:31.780\n Like, how did it come to this?\n\n2:38:31.780 --> 2:38:34.780\n There's, but the point is there's alternatives\n\n2:38:34.780 --> 2:38:36.300\n that are perhaps more effective.\n\n2:38:36.300 --> 2:38:37.140\n Yeah.\n\n2:38:37.140 --> 2:38:39.780\n In my perspective, this might be clueless,\n\n2:38:39.780 --> 2:38:43.220\n there's almost no clothing that's more effective\n\n2:38:43.220 --> 2:38:46.960\n than almost assuming the situation is no geek grappling.\n\n2:38:46.960 --> 2:38:49.700\n Like, I feel like clothing.\n\n2:38:49.700 --> 2:38:51.260\n Particularly when you start to add hitting,\n\n2:38:51.260 --> 2:38:52.980\n like every single time I start grabbing your clothes,\n\n2:38:52.980 --> 2:38:55.160\n if you start hitting and it's not like nothing could work,\n\n2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:56.440\n but most of the time you're like,\n\n2:38:56.440 --> 2:38:58.980\n why am I not using my arms for something better\n\n2:38:58.980 --> 2:39:00.700\n than what I'm doing them right now?\n\n2:39:00.700 --> 2:39:01.580\n Right, yeah.\n\n2:39:01.580 --> 2:39:04.860\n It's very difficult for me to, I don't know,\n\n2:39:04.860 --> 2:39:06.280\n in terms of just distance,\n\n2:39:06.280 --> 2:39:08.720\n I can't imagine a case of different distances,\n\n2:39:08.720 --> 2:39:12.800\n even like situations where, let's not talk about like,\n\n2:39:13.660 --> 2:39:16.460\n like a situation where you haven't both yet agreed\n\n2:39:16.460 --> 2:39:17.700\n that a fight is happening.\n\n2:39:18.780 --> 2:39:21.220\n Solid clothing is nice if they have it on then.\n\n2:39:21.220 --> 2:39:22.140\n I mean. Solid clothing?\n\n2:39:22.140 --> 2:39:23.660\n Oh yeah, like something like a good jacket\n\n2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:25.260\n because you can snatch somebody on their face.\n\n2:39:25.260 --> 2:39:26.580\n Snatch down.\n\n2:39:26.580 --> 2:39:27.980\n Yeah, you know, it's like, if you, if you took my,\n\n2:39:27.980 --> 2:39:29.940\n like, you know, like you snap down and judo,\n\n2:39:29.940 --> 2:39:32.080\n like how easy it is to snap down a beginner.\n\n2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:32.920\n Yeah.\n\n2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:33.740\n It's like.\n\n2:39:33.740 --> 2:39:34.580\n So I agree with you.\n\n2:39:34.580 --> 2:39:35.740\n Actually a tie in that sense\n\n2:39:35.740 --> 2:39:37.740\n might be a really effective way to snap down.\n\n2:39:37.740 --> 2:39:39.340\n So like the snap down is really powerful\n\n2:39:39.340 --> 2:39:43.060\n to change the like disorient the situation\n\n2:39:43.060 --> 2:39:45.660\n and give you a lot of different opportunities\n\n2:39:45.660 --> 2:39:49.540\n for, you know, taking their back, taking them down.\n\n2:39:49.540 --> 2:39:50.540\n Doing hilarious stuff,\n\n2:39:50.540 --> 2:39:52.780\n like snapping them down with a tie into your knee.\n\n2:39:52.780 --> 2:39:55.400\n And then when they come back up doing this, you're already.\n\n2:39:55.400 --> 2:39:57.020\n So yeah, in that sense, I agree,\n\n2:39:57.020 --> 2:39:58.460\n but not as a choking mechanism\n\n2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:00.500\n because the concern Joe had is choke.\n\n2:40:00.500 --> 2:40:02.100\n I think you would probably choke me with your tie\n\n2:40:02.100 --> 2:40:03.480\n more easily than I could choke you with your tie.\n\n2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:04.320\n Probably.\n\n2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:05.140\n I'm serious.\n\n2:40:05.140 --> 2:40:05.980\n Cause like, if you get, you can get,\n\n2:40:05.980 --> 2:40:06.820\n like you get my back\n\n2:40:06.820 --> 2:40:08.620\n and you can put it around somebody's neck, you know,\n\n2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:11.520\n like, like, like, you ever see a diehard?\n\n2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:12.360\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:12.360 --> 2:40:15.220\n Yeah, you remember when the super Swedish looking blonde dude\n\n2:40:15.220 --> 2:40:16.060\n or whatever was,\n\n2:40:16.060 --> 2:40:18.180\n it was trying to choke Bruce Willis with the,\n\n2:40:18.180 --> 2:40:20.580\n with the chain and then he ended up getting choked himself\n\n2:40:20.580 --> 2:40:22.100\n with the chain if I recall this properly.\n\n2:40:22.100 --> 2:40:23.660\n But anyway, yeah, like, like that.\n\n2:40:23.660 --> 2:40:25.340\n But I don't, I don't feel like,\n\n2:40:25.340 --> 2:40:27.200\n I feel like if I start grabbing your tie,\n\n2:40:27.200 --> 2:40:29.940\n you have too many other great options.\n\n2:40:29.940 --> 2:40:31.260\n I mean, I do like the snap down\n\n2:40:31.260 --> 2:40:32.420\n that you actually made me realize.\n\n2:40:32.420 --> 2:40:34.060\n No, I think you have a good there.\n\n2:40:34.060 --> 2:40:34.900\n What's that?\n\n2:40:34.900 --> 2:40:35.900\n I think you're on the right path with it.\n\n2:40:35.900 --> 2:40:36.740\n With a snap down?\n\n2:40:36.740 --> 2:40:38.220\n Yeah, particularly if you start with like one of these,\n\n2:40:38.220 --> 2:40:39.500\n like, you know, like, like you,\n\n2:40:39.500 --> 2:40:40.660\n like you poke your finger in my chest\n\n2:40:40.660 --> 2:40:42.440\n and then snap down real quick.\n\n2:40:42.440 --> 2:40:43.280\n Oh yeah.\n\n2:40:43.280 --> 2:40:45.380\n And also, socially speaking,\n\n2:40:45.380 --> 2:40:48.020\n it's not a threatening thing to, you know,\n\n2:40:48.020 --> 2:40:49.460\n to reach for the tie.\n\n2:40:49.460 --> 2:40:51.020\n It's not particularly like a business setting.\n\n2:40:51.020 --> 2:40:51.860\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:40:51.860 --> 2:40:52.880\n They'll never see it coming.\n\n2:40:52.880 --> 2:40:53.720\n Yeah.\n\n2:40:53.720 --> 2:40:54.820\n Cause I was thinking choke,\n\n2:40:54.820 --> 2:40:56.900\n but it's not, it's a really good leverage point\n\n2:40:56.900 --> 2:40:58.540\n cause like grabbing a jacket,\n\n2:40:58.540 --> 2:41:00.620\n the jacket will slide if you try to snap down.\n\n2:41:00.620 --> 2:41:02.100\n You really have to get a hole,\n\n2:41:02.100 --> 2:41:03.380\n like a really good hold.\n\n2:41:03.380 --> 2:41:04.220\n That's a good point.\n\n2:41:04.220 --> 2:41:05.040\n Cause it's around the back of the neck.\n\n2:41:05.040 --> 2:41:05.880\n But what if it's a clip on?\n\n2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:07.060\n How much of a jackass would you look like?\n\n2:41:07.060 --> 2:41:08.660\n You feel like,\n\n2:41:08.660 --> 2:41:10.100\n and then they just stick you on.\n\n2:41:10.100 --> 2:41:11.940\n But you ever see the Japanese politician\n\n2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:13.020\n or I think it was Japan.\n\n2:41:13.020 --> 2:41:13.860\n The judo throw?\n\n2:41:13.860 --> 2:41:15.020\n Yeah, it was, that guy is so,\n\n2:41:15.020 --> 2:41:16.700\n he was so calm and cool.\n\n2:41:16.700 --> 2:41:18.580\n Had like, it was every,\n\n2:41:18.580 --> 2:41:20.540\n it was beautiful technique.\n\n2:41:20.540 --> 2:41:23.820\n The level of, actually the throw was even gentle.\n\n2:41:23.820 --> 2:41:24.780\n But yeah, it was perfect.\n\n2:41:24.780 --> 2:41:25.620\n It was amazing.\n\n2:41:25.620 --> 2:41:26.440\n Well executed.\n\n2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:27.280\n Yeah.\n\n2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:29.380\n More of our politicians just toss the shit out of each other.\n\n2:41:29.380 --> 2:41:31.300\n Yeah, we need more Teddy Roosevelts.\n\n2:41:31.300 --> 2:41:32.120\n Exactly.\n\n2:41:32.120 --> 2:41:33.640\n I like our politicians like talking about fighting\n\n2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:35.100\n when it's clear that none of them even,\n\n2:41:35.100 --> 2:41:37.220\n it would ever have been in a fight ever.\n\n2:41:37.220 --> 2:41:38.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:41:38.060 --> 2:41:39.460\n Somebody was saying Teddy Roosevelt was interesting.\n\n2:41:39.460 --> 2:41:40.960\n I didn't realize this.\n\n2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:44.140\n Is he's one of the greatest presidents this country's had.\n\n2:41:44.140 --> 2:41:46.540\n And he was one of the greatest presidents,\n\n2:41:46.540 --> 2:41:49.140\n even though he faced no crisis whatsoever.\n\n2:41:49.140 --> 2:41:51.020\n He literally willed himself.\n\n2:41:51.020 --> 2:41:53.020\n Like nothing happened during his presidency.\n\n2:41:53.020 --> 2:41:56.820\n He's just a bad motherfucker who made really great speeches.\n\n2:41:56.820 --> 2:41:57.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:41:57.660 --> 2:42:00.660\n So he like, this made me realize,\n\n2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:03.060\n I was just talking to a historian that like,\n\n2:42:03.060 --> 2:42:05.220\n most of the people who we think are great\n\n2:42:05.220 --> 2:42:07.460\n need also a good crisis that they've,\n\n2:42:07.460 --> 2:42:09.220\n that reveal their greatness.\n\n2:42:09.220 --> 2:42:10.380\n But Muhammad Ali, right?\n\n2:42:10.380 --> 2:42:12.860\n And there's Muhammad Ali, I mean, in sports.\n\n2:42:12.860 --> 2:42:13.780\n But you know what I mean?\n\n2:42:13.780 --> 2:42:15.380\n Like the circumstances, what is greatness?\n\n2:42:15.380 --> 2:42:16.220\n You know what I mean?\n\n2:42:16.220 --> 2:42:18.140\n It's like, you have to, it's not just your capacity.\n\n2:42:18.140 --> 2:42:19.840\n It's what you face, right?\n\n2:42:19.840 --> 2:42:21.800\n It's the quality of opposition, circumstance,\n\n2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:22.920\n what you overcome.\n\n2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:25.320\n So I guess what you're saying is Joe Rogan is wrong\n\n2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:26.980\n about the tie thing.\n\n2:42:26.980 --> 2:42:28.820\n You know, I don't want to go so far as saying he's wrong.\n\n2:42:28.820 --> 2:42:30.580\n I, you know, the man's not here to defend himself.\n\n2:42:30.580 --> 2:42:32.460\n Maybe he has some things that I'm not understanding.\n\n2:42:32.460 --> 2:42:33.300\n I'm willing to.\n\n2:42:33.300 --> 2:42:34.340\n No, he has not deeply thought this.\n\n2:42:34.340 --> 2:42:35.820\n This is my main criticism of Joe.\n\n2:42:35.820 --> 2:42:37.300\n He's not deeply thought to this.\n\n2:42:37.300 --> 2:42:39.300\n And the MMA journalists will be like,\n\n2:42:39.300 --> 2:42:41.820\n Ryan Hall says Joe Rogan is wrong.\n\n2:42:41.820 --> 2:42:42.800\n And hates ties.\n\n2:42:42.800 --> 2:42:43.900\n And hates ties.\n\n2:42:44.880 --> 2:42:47.640\n They'll integrate, hit their back in there somehow.\n\n2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:48.480\n Nice, nice.\n\n2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:52.040\n What's, you're talking about greatness\n\n2:42:52.040 --> 2:42:56.620\n and greatness requiring a difficult moment in time.\n\n2:42:56.620 --> 2:42:58.780\n Can you like reflect back and think\n\n2:42:58.780 --> 2:43:01.880\n what are some of the hardest, if not the hardest thing\n\n2:43:01.880 --> 2:43:04.380\n you've ever had to do in your life?\n\n2:43:04.380 --> 2:43:06.940\n Well, you know, I think I've had a bunch of things.\n\n2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:09.420\n You know, I've had a lot of things not go my way.\n\n2:43:09.420 --> 2:43:10.820\n You know, I've been incredibly fortunate.\n\n2:43:10.820 --> 2:43:12.860\n I've had a lot of things go my way also.\n\n2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:17.500\n But leaving, leaving Team Lord Urban in 2008,\n\n2:43:17.500 --> 2:43:21.220\n which I firmly believe was the right thing to do,\n\n2:43:21.220 --> 2:43:25.440\n is one of the, that was very difficult at the time.\n\n2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:27.080\n Not like, not a difficult choice,\n\n2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:29.620\n but it was because of why I was leaving.\n\n2:43:29.620 --> 2:43:30.620\n But.\n\n2:43:30.620 --> 2:43:31.640\n Just psychologically.\n\n2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:33.020\n First of all, loss in general.\n\n2:43:33.020 --> 2:43:33.860\n Leaving.\n\n2:43:33.860 --> 2:43:34.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:43:34.700 --> 2:43:35.700\n Team, family, all kinds.\n\n2:43:35.700 --> 2:43:37.340\n Doesn't matter what the circumstances.\n\n2:43:37.340 --> 2:43:38.340\n I didn't lose any friends,\n\n2:43:38.340 --> 2:43:40.240\n but I lost a lot of people I thought were my friends.\n\n2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:42.460\n And I, I lost training.\n\n2:43:42.460 --> 2:43:44.860\n I lost, I'd also had like a really serious,\n\n2:43:44.860 --> 2:43:46.700\n my wrist only does that.\n\n2:43:46.700 --> 2:43:50.740\n So like, I had a really serious wrist surgery,\n\n2:43:50.740 --> 2:43:52.060\n like that I didn't know if I was going to be able\n\n2:43:52.060 --> 2:43:53.280\n to compete anymore after that.\n\n2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:54.380\n I just got my brown belt.\n\n2:43:54.380 --> 2:43:56.520\n That was, it was a tough time,\n\n2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:58.940\n like psychologically, physically, everything.\n\n2:43:58.940 --> 2:44:01.060\n But I was very, very motivated to do my best\n\n2:44:01.060 --> 2:44:03.180\n and to push through it and to,\n\n2:44:03.180 --> 2:44:04.860\n it was to carry on in a positive direction,\n\n2:44:04.860 --> 2:44:05.680\n no matter what.\n\n2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:06.820\n A different direction.\n\n2:44:06.820 --> 2:44:07.660\n And.\n\n2:44:07.660 --> 2:44:08.680\n Were you lonely?\n\n2:44:08.680 --> 2:44:10.060\n This is the thing about family,\n\n2:44:10.060 --> 2:44:13.500\n even if it's an abusive family, leaving is tough.\n\n2:44:13.500 --> 2:44:14.860\n People are complicated.\n\n2:44:14.860 --> 2:44:17.740\n And even people that I, that I don't think very well of,\n\n2:44:17.740 --> 2:44:19.980\n that I think on the whole, I don't think very well of,\n\n2:44:19.980 --> 2:44:23.320\n it's, it's unfair to paint them with one brush.\n\n2:44:24.260 --> 2:44:26.660\n You know, obviously there's greater and lesser examples\n\n2:44:26.660 --> 2:44:28.420\n of that, like the person we discussed last time,\n\n2:44:28.420 --> 2:44:31.340\n who's an infinitely, you know, beyond almost anyone\n\n2:44:31.340 --> 2:44:32.500\n that we could ever imagine meeting\n\n2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:33.860\n in our own personal lives.\n\n2:44:33.860 --> 2:44:34.700\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:34.700 --> 2:44:35.860\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:35.860 --> 2:44:36.700\n Bloody elbow.\n\n2:44:36.700 --> 2:44:37.820\n Yeah.\n\n2:44:37.820 --> 2:44:41.020\n In terms of forgiveness and hate, I mean, do you,\n\n2:44:41.020 --> 2:44:43.180\n do you have hate in your heart for,\n\n2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:44.700\n for people in your past?\n\n2:44:44.700 --> 2:44:45.540\n No.\n\n2:44:45.540 --> 2:44:46.360\n For that process?\n\n2:44:46.360 --> 2:44:47.200\n No.\n\n2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:48.040\n I mean, there were definitely times\n\n2:44:48.040 --> 2:44:49.500\n where I've been negatively motivated\n\n2:44:49.500 --> 2:44:52.820\n to prove people wrong or to accomplish things in spite.\n\n2:44:52.820 --> 2:44:55.480\n And I think that some of that is valuable,\n\n2:44:55.480 --> 2:44:57.260\n if I be lying, if I felt differently.\n\n2:44:57.260 --> 2:45:00.620\n I think particularly, I do really well in conflict.\n\n2:45:01.500 --> 2:45:02.340\n I'm useless for that.\n\n2:45:02.340 --> 2:45:03.620\n This is the usual deadline thing.\n\n2:45:03.620 --> 2:45:04.460\n I'm useless, yeah.\n\n2:45:04.460 --> 2:45:05.300\n I'm useless.\n\n2:45:05.300 --> 2:45:06.120\n I like the chaos.\n\n2:45:06.120 --> 2:45:06.960\n I'm useless, yeah, I do.\n\n2:45:06.960 --> 2:45:07.800\n I'm useless without an antagonist.\n\n2:45:07.800 --> 2:45:08.900\n I like fighting.\n\n2:45:08.900 --> 2:45:10.460\n I like competition.\n\n2:45:10.460 --> 2:45:11.500\n I like being pushed.\n\n2:45:11.500 --> 2:45:13.260\n I like feeling like if I don't play well,\n\n2:45:13.260 --> 2:45:14.860\n I'm going to get hurt.\n\n2:45:14.860 --> 2:45:16.780\n I have no choice but to play well\n\n2:45:16.780 --> 2:45:18.580\n or play with everything I got at the very least.\n\n2:45:18.580 --> 2:45:21.000\n And I guess I would say though, is, you know,\n\n2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:24.500\n as I've gotten, you know, more time and, you know,\n\n2:45:24.500 --> 2:45:27.580\n lived a little bit longer, you see, you know,\n\n2:45:27.580 --> 2:45:31.340\n various situations for, you know, you know,\n\n2:45:31.340 --> 2:45:36.100\n with increased color, I guess I would say, increased clarity.\n\n2:45:36.100 --> 2:45:40.980\n And, you know, there are a lot of lessons to be learned,\n\n2:45:40.980 --> 2:45:43.920\n even from times in history or bad experience that we have.\n\n2:45:43.920 --> 2:45:44.760\n And the question is,\n\n2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:46.700\n can we take those lessons and move forward?\n\n2:45:46.700 --> 2:45:48.180\n And that's, again, what I think we're seeing\n\n2:45:48.180 --> 2:45:50.140\n in sometimes socially right now,\n\n2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:52.500\n we're forgetting important lessons of the past.\n\n2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:53.740\n And that's not good.\n\n2:45:53.740 --> 2:45:56.580\n Not saying, hey, I don't get why we could be going\n\n2:45:56.580 --> 2:45:58.700\n in this direction or that, I understand entirely,\n\n2:45:58.700 --> 2:46:00.980\n but hey, let's not forget the lesson\n\n2:46:00.980 --> 2:46:02.420\n so we don't have to learn them again\n\n2:46:02.420 --> 2:46:05.020\n because that doesn't really serve anybody.\n\n2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:07.060\n And anyway, I guess I would say I'm thankful\n\n2:46:07.060 --> 2:46:10.300\n for all of the experiences, difficult and otherwise,\n\n2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:12.500\n mostly difficult, honestly, most of the times I remember,\n\n2:46:12.500 --> 2:46:14.260\n I'm thankful for every loss I've ever had,\n\n2:46:14.260 --> 2:46:15.740\n particularly the tough ones.\n\n2:46:15.740 --> 2:46:18.820\n I'm thankful for, you know, for all the relationships.\n\n2:46:18.820 --> 2:46:20.260\n I've been, many people have taught me many things.\n\n2:46:20.260 --> 2:46:21.340\n They continue to teach me many things,\n\n2:46:21.340 --> 2:46:23.180\n some of whom are still some of my closest friends,\n\n2:46:23.180 --> 2:46:25.260\n some of whom are people I really don't get along with at all.\n\n2:46:25.260 --> 2:46:29.180\n And some of whom are people I think really poorly of.\n\n2:46:29.180 --> 2:46:30.860\n Oh, there's not many of that last group.\n\n2:46:30.860 --> 2:46:34.780\n What I guess I would say is there's been a lot of things\n\n2:46:34.780 --> 2:46:38.180\n and opportunities to learn and, you know, throughout that.\n\n2:46:38.180 --> 2:46:39.660\n And also it's not as if I've never done,\n\n2:46:39.660 --> 2:46:40.820\n made any mistakes myself.\n\n2:46:40.820 --> 2:46:44.260\n Now, again, there are magnitude differences I like to think.\n\n2:46:44.260 --> 2:46:46.140\n And I can definitely say that none of the mistakes\n\n2:46:46.140 --> 2:46:48.660\n that I've ever made have been mistakes of intention.\n\n2:46:48.660 --> 2:46:50.220\n You know, I've screwed up a lot of things in my life,\n\n2:46:50.220 --> 2:46:52.700\n but I can confidently and easily say\n\n2:46:52.700 --> 2:46:55.020\n that I've never had ill intent towards people\n\n2:46:55.020 --> 2:46:55.860\n as I've done it.\n\n2:46:55.860 --> 2:46:56.700\n You sit there and you're like, man,\n\n2:46:56.700 --> 2:46:57.540\n this is the right thing, this is the right thing.\n\n2:46:57.540 --> 2:46:59.060\n And sometimes I've been wrong.\n\n2:46:59.060 --> 2:47:02.260\n But, you know, you never sit out with malicious intent.\n\n2:47:02.260 --> 2:47:03.900\n And I think that when I find\n\n2:47:03.900 --> 2:47:06.060\n that I think people do things differently,\n\n2:47:06.060 --> 2:47:07.740\n when I do think that there is malicious intent,\n\n2:47:07.740 --> 2:47:09.580\n I have a difficult time forgiving that.\n\n2:47:09.580 --> 2:47:14.340\n How does love win over hate, Ryan Hall, in this world?\n\n2:47:14.340 --> 2:47:16.260\n We talk about social media,\n\n2:47:16.260 --> 2:47:18.540\n we talk about forgiveness\n\n2:47:19.580 --> 2:47:23.060\n of some of the more complicated people in your past.\n\n2:47:24.420 --> 2:47:27.460\n If we scale that to the entire world\n\n2:47:27.460 --> 2:47:30.060\n before the AI destroys us,\n\n2:47:30.060 --> 2:47:34.100\n and the human race is lost to history,\n\n2:47:34.100 --> 2:47:35.900\n how do you think love wins over hate?\n\n2:47:35.900 --> 2:47:37.820\n Well, I'd like to preface this by saying\n\n2:47:37.820 --> 2:47:39.740\n I tried to make pancakes the other day.\n\n2:47:39.740 --> 2:47:40.580\n Yes.\n\n2:47:41.580 --> 2:47:42.420\n Didn't work.\n\n2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:44.780\n But I'm happy to comment on this.\n\n2:47:44.780 --> 2:47:49.780\n So basically, I think most of the times\n\n2:47:50.580 --> 2:47:54.540\n that I can think of that I've struggled,\n\n2:47:54.540 --> 2:47:57.900\n you know, and the times that I've read about\n\n2:47:57.900 --> 2:48:01.460\n is being unable to see the humanity in other people.\n\n2:48:01.460 --> 2:48:03.820\n And also, even in sometimes our enemies\n\n2:48:03.820 --> 2:48:05.460\n and the people that have done awful things,\n\n2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:09.060\n and you go, what would allow people to do this,\n\n2:48:09.060 --> 2:48:09.900\n that, or the other?\n\n2:48:09.900 --> 2:48:11.860\n And that doesn't forgive what they've done,\n\n2:48:11.860 --> 2:48:13.860\n depending upon, you know, some things are forgivable,\n\n2:48:13.860 --> 2:48:15.020\n some things are less so.\n\n2:48:15.020 --> 2:48:16.460\n But you wanna understand why.\n\n2:48:16.460 --> 2:48:17.540\n It's like, to our knowledge,\n\n2:48:17.540 --> 2:48:19.460\n demons don't populate our world.\n\n2:48:19.460 --> 2:48:22.620\n Neither do like literal angels walking around\n\n2:48:22.620 --> 2:48:24.140\n being actually perfect.\n\n2:48:24.140 --> 2:48:25.900\n A lot of times, the things that it's,\n\n2:48:25.900 --> 2:48:27.980\n I find it deeply amusing watching, you know,\n\n2:48:27.980 --> 2:48:29.980\n people hoisted by their own batard on Twitter,\n\n2:48:29.980 --> 2:48:32.340\n even though it's gross and it's really unproductive.\n\n2:48:32.340 --> 2:48:35.060\n It's actually like equal parts amusing and like awful,\n\n2:48:35.060 --> 2:48:37.180\n because you're not happy that someone's\n\n2:48:37.180 --> 2:48:40.780\n being raked over the coals, particularly unjustifiably.\n\n2:48:40.780 --> 2:48:43.020\n But it is funny when it's the exact same thing\n\n2:48:43.020 --> 2:48:44.540\n they were raking others over the coals for,\n\n2:48:44.540 --> 2:48:45.940\n not like a week or two prior,\n\n2:48:45.940 --> 2:48:48.380\n and that's happened repeatedly and will continue to happen.\n\n2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:51.180\n And I guess I would say, as you mentioned, you know,\n\n2:48:51.180 --> 2:48:53.300\n a prior, you know, like a recognition\n\n2:48:53.300 --> 2:48:56.740\n of the humanity of others of that all of us make mistakes,\n\n2:48:56.740 --> 2:48:58.860\n that it's difficult to understand intention.\n\n2:48:58.860 --> 2:49:00.580\n I've had arguments with close friends of mine\n\n2:49:00.580 --> 2:49:03.940\n over text message where both of us ended up super pissed\n\n2:49:03.940 --> 2:49:07.220\n because we were completely misreading what the tone,\n\n2:49:07.220 --> 2:49:08.900\n the intention of what the other person was doing.\n\n2:49:08.900 --> 2:49:11.460\n And even if I was reading it correctly, which I wasn't,\n\n2:49:11.460 --> 2:49:15.660\n it's so easy to ascribe the most negative possible,\n\n2:49:15.660 --> 2:49:18.300\n you know, the least charitable assessment\n\n2:49:18.300 --> 2:49:19.140\n of what they're doing.\n\n2:49:19.140 --> 2:49:21.340\n And I think that that's such a dangerous way\n\n2:49:21.340 --> 2:49:23.380\n to live your life and it's also just a fruitless way\n\n2:49:23.380 --> 2:49:24.260\n to live your life.\n\n2:49:24.260 --> 2:49:26.540\n You know, it's one thing to go, hey, why did you do that?\n\n2:49:26.540 --> 2:49:27.460\n I was pissed.\n\n2:49:27.460 --> 2:49:28.380\n Did you, what did you do?\n\n2:49:28.380 --> 2:49:29.980\n You just, you did that to make yourself feel better,\n\n2:49:29.980 --> 2:49:31.300\n like you're damn right I did.\n\n2:49:31.300 --> 2:49:34.300\n And have I done that plenty of times in my life?\n\n2:49:34.300 --> 2:49:36.540\n Yeah, I would lie if I said that I didn't, you know,\n\n2:49:36.540 --> 2:49:38.100\n why did you, why did you punch that guy in the face?\n\n2:49:38.100 --> 2:49:40.980\n He was going crazy at me and hit me and I asked him to stop.\n\n2:49:40.980 --> 2:49:43.100\n And then I gave warning and I put him on his ass.\n\n2:49:43.100 --> 2:49:44.460\n I'm like, no, I'm not sorry.\n\n2:49:44.460 --> 2:49:47.700\n But then looking back now with years to sit on them,\n\n2:49:47.700 --> 2:49:49.980\n like, do I understand why I did what I did?\n\n2:49:49.980 --> 2:49:51.460\n Absolutely.\n\n2:49:51.460 --> 2:49:53.220\n Would I like to respond differently now?\n\n2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:54.140\n Yeah, I would.\n\n2:49:54.140 --> 2:49:55.980\n You know, and it doesn't mean that,\n\n2:49:55.980 --> 2:49:59.340\n I think plenty of things that people do are understandable.\n\n2:49:59.340 --> 2:50:01.980\n Doesn't mean, understandable doesn't mean correct.\n\n2:50:01.980 --> 2:50:03.580\n Understandable doesn't mean that you go,\n\n2:50:03.580 --> 2:50:04.420\n oh yeah, that's great.\n\n2:50:04.420 --> 2:50:07.940\n You go, I could see someone doing such a thing.\n\n2:50:07.940 --> 2:50:09.740\n But I guess just trying to understand\n\n2:50:09.740 --> 2:50:11.300\n and see the humanity in others.\n\n2:50:11.300 --> 2:50:12.900\n Cause if I can't see the humanity in others,\n\n2:50:12.900 --> 2:50:14.540\n how can I see it in myself?\n\n2:50:14.540 --> 2:50:17.300\n And also, you know, how am I meant to interact with everyone?\n\n2:50:17.300 --> 2:50:18.540\n As you said, whether, you know,\n\n2:50:18.540 --> 2:50:20.620\n even if we're a society of individuals\n\n2:50:20.620 --> 2:50:22.180\n for at least for the time being, hopefully,\n\n2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:23.860\n you know, in perpetuity,\n\n2:50:23.860 --> 2:50:26.420\n we still come together as a whole.\n\n2:50:26.420 --> 2:50:28.660\n And watching, it's weird.\n\n2:50:28.660 --> 2:50:30.660\n Like you said, if I only ask why once,\n\n2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:32.900\n I start with, stay out of my way\n\n2:50:32.900 --> 2:50:33.740\n and I'll stay out of yours.\n\n2:50:33.740 --> 2:50:34.700\n Leave me the fuck alone.\n\n2:50:34.700 --> 2:50:36.740\n You're like, okay, that's fine, Ryan.\n\n2:50:36.740 --> 2:50:37.580\n But that's easy for you to say,\n\n2:50:37.580 --> 2:50:40.380\n living in a society that doesn't actually function like that.\n\n2:50:40.380 --> 2:50:41.940\n So it's a little bit cheap.\n\n2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:43.860\n But if I recognize that that's step one is,\n\n2:50:43.860 --> 2:50:45.340\n I don't hurt you and you don't hurt me.\n\n2:50:45.340 --> 2:50:48.300\n But then we go, well, but how can I help you?\n\n2:50:48.300 --> 2:50:49.140\n That's step two.\n\n2:50:49.140 --> 2:50:50.540\n And then it goes way beyond that\n\n2:50:50.540 --> 2:50:51.740\n and a lot further than I've thought about it.\n\n2:50:51.740 --> 2:50:52.780\n But I guess what I would just say is,\n\n2:50:52.780 --> 2:50:55.220\n again, recognition of the humanity in others\n\n2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:57.020\n and that we all have different strengths,\n\n2:50:57.020 --> 2:50:57.860\n we all have different weaknesses.\n\n2:50:57.860 --> 2:50:59.260\n And you can never really be sure\n\n2:50:59.260 --> 2:51:00.260\n where the other person's coming from.\n\n2:51:00.260 --> 2:51:02.060\n But if we approach things charitably,\n\n2:51:02.060 --> 2:51:05.660\n as charitably as we would hope others would approach us,\n\n2:51:05.660 --> 2:51:06.740\n I think we'll do a lot better.\n\n2:51:06.740 --> 2:51:08.420\n And I guess one thing that I read that I liked\n\n2:51:08.420 --> 2:51:10.700\n that I thought was accurate and unfortunately disappointing\n\n2:51:10.700 --> 2:51:13.460\n was everyone is a great, you know, jury,\n\n2:51:13.460 --> 2:51:15.300\n I read there, I'm sorry, a great lawyer for themselves\n\n2:51:15.300 --> 2:51:16.500\n and a judge for others.\n\n2:51:16.500 --> 2:51:18.940\n And I think that's a terrible way to live life,\n\n2:51:18.940 --> 2:51:20.380\n even if it's an understandable one.\n\n2:51:20.380 --> 2:51:21.220\n I don't know, I'm sorry.\n\n2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:24.660\n And then probably flipping that is the right way to live.\n\n2:51:24.660 --> 2:51:28.580\n Being constantly judgmental of yourself\n\n2:51:28.580 --> 2:51:30.380\n and a defender of others.\n\n2:51:30.380 --> 2:51:32.660\n And that results ultimately in an interaction\n\n2:51:32.660 --> 2:51:35.380\n that deescalates versus escalates.\n\n2:51:35.380 --> 2:51:36.380\n Right.\n\n2:51:36.380 --> 2:51:38.660\n And we can all live in a world like that.\n\n2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:39.780\n And sometimes you're like, hey man,\n\n2:51:39.780 --> 2:51:41.740\n people that deserve punishment won't get it.\n\n2:51:41.740 --> 2:51:43.140\n Like, okay, hey, but what do they say?\n\n2:51:43.140 --> 2:51:45.340\n Better to have 10 guilty people go free\n\n2:51:45.340 --> 2:51:47.700\n than wanting this in person, you know, burn.\n\n2:51:47.700 --> 2:51:51.420\n And ultimately that is, I think that is a better world\n\n2:51:51.420 --> 2:51:53.420\n than the other way around.\n\n2:51:53.420 --> 2:51:58.220\n And if all else fails, join the team that builds the AI\n\n2:51:58.220 --> 2:51:59.540\n that kills all humans.\n\n2:51:59.540 --> 2:52:00.380\n Yeah, obviously.\n\n2:52:00.380 --> 2:52:01.260\n I mean, if you have to be on a team,\n\n2:52:01.260 --> 2:52:02.100\n pick the winning team.\n\n2:52:02.100 --> 2:52:03.260\n That's been the...\n\n2:52:03.260 --> 2:52:04.740\n That's my hiring pitch, actually.\n\n2:52:04.740 --> 2:52:05.820\n That's a good hiring pitch.\n\n2:52:05.820 --> 2:52:07.140\n You still taking resumes?\n\n2:52:07.140 --> 2:52:10.940\n You want to be on the team that doesn't die\n\n2:52:10.940 --> 2:52:12.220\n during the great apocalypse.\n\n2:52:12.220 --> 2:52:13.060\n Not immediately.\n\n2:52:13.060 --> 2:52:14.540\n You want to be on the one that's, you know,\n\n2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:17.100\n eventually long suffering and stepped on, right?\n\n2:52:17.100 --> 2:52:17.940\n Yeah.\n\n2:52:17.940 --> 2:52:19.580\n Life is suffering, Ryan Hall.\n\n2:52:19.580 --> 2:52:21.740\n This was an amazing conversation.\n\n2:52:21.740 --> 2:52:22.780\n I really enjoyed talking to you.\n\n2:52:22.780 --> 2:52:24.580\n I could probably talk to you for many more hours.\n\n2:52:24.580 --> 2:52:26.580\n I hope I do as well.\n\n2:52:26.580 --> 2:52:28.260\n Ryan, I love you, buddy.\n\n2:52:28.260 --> 2:52:29.340\n This was a great conversation.\n\n2:52:29.340 --> 2:52:30.420\n Thanks for talking to me.\n\n2:52:30.420 --> 2:52:31.260\n Thank you so much for having me.\n\n2:52:31.260 --> 2:52:33.020\n I really appreciate it.\n\n2:52:33.020 --> 2:52:35.460\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ryan Hall\n\n2:52:35.460 --> 2:52:37.380\n and thank you to

2:52:53.380\n from Frank Herbert in Dune.\n\n2:52:53.380 --> 2:52:55.020\n I must not fear.\n\n2:52:55.020 --> 2:52:57.180\n Fear is the mind killer.\n\n2:52:57.180 --> 2:53:01.100\n Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration.\n\n2:53:01.100 --> 2:53:02.860\n I will face my fear.\n\n2:53:02.860 --> 2:53:05.820\n I will permit it to pass over me and through me.\n\n2:53:05.820 --> 2:53:07.460\n And when it has gone past,\n\n2:53:07.460 --> 2:53:10.700\n I will turn the inner eye to see its path.\n\n2:53:10.700 --> 2:53:14.260\n Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.\n\n2:53:14.260 --> 2:53:15.660\n Only I will remain.\n\n2:53:15.660 --> 2:53:43.660\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
