00:08.320\n And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,\n\n00:08.320 --> 00:10.760\n which is to say they release energy.\n\n00:10.760 --> 00:13.280\n If you have hydrogen and CO2,\n\n00:13.280 --> 00:15.240\n and you put them together in a falcon tube\n\n00:15.240 --> 00:17.320\n and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade,\n\n00:17.320 --> 00:19.980\n and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,\n\n00:19.980 --> 00:21.320\n nothing's gonna happen.\n\n00:21.320 --> 00:24.780\n But thermodynamically, that is less stable.\n\n00:24.780 --> 00:28.240\n Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.\n\n00:28.240 --> 00:31.240\n What should happen is you get cells coming out.\n\n00:31.240 --> 00:32.400\n Why doesn't that happen?\n\n00:32.400 --> 00:34.760\n It's because of the kinetic barriers.\n\n00:34.760 --> 00:36.360\n That's where you need the spark.\n\n00:38.200 --> 00:40.680\n The following is a conversation with Nick Lane,\n\n00:40.680 --> 00:43.400\n a biochemist at University College London\n\n00:43.400 --> 00:46.200\n and author of some of my favorite books\n\n00:46.200 --> 00:49.640\n on biology, science, and life ever written,\n\n00:49.640 --> 00:51.440\n including his two most recent titled\n\n00:51.440 --> 00:54.520\n \"'Transformer,' The Deep Chemistry of Life and Death,\"\n\n00:54.520 --> 00:59.440\n and the vital question, why is life the way it is?\n\n01:00.280 --> 01:02.340\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n01:02.340 --> 01:04.460\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n01:04.460 --> 01:05.760\n in the description.\n\n01:05.760 --> 01:09.020\n And now, dear friends, here's Nick Lane.\n\n01:09.880 --> 01:11.820\n Let's start with perhaps the most mysterious,\n\n01:11.820 --> 01:16.620\n the most interesting question that we little humans\n\n01:16.620 --> 01:18.140\n can ask of ourselves.\n\n01:18.140 --> 01:20.640\n How did life originate on Earth?\n\n01:20.640 --> 01:24.020\n You could ask anybody working on the subject,\n\n01:24.020 --> 01:26.920\n and you'll get a different answer from all of them.\n\n01:26.920 --> 01:30.620\n They will be pretty passionately held opinions,\n\n01:30.620 --> 01:32.620\n and their opinions grounded in science,\n\n01:34.060 --> 01:36.160\n but they're still really, at this point, their opinions,\n\n01:36.160 --> 01:37.920\n because there's so much stuff to know\n\n01:38.880 --> 01:42.860\n that all we can ever do is get a small slice of it,\n\n01:42.860 --> 01:44.940\n and it's the context which matters.\n\n01:44.940 --> 01:46.600\n So I can give you my answer.\n\n01:46.600 --> 01:50.680\n My answer is from a biologist's point of view.\n\n01:50.680 --> 01:54.780\n That has been missing from the equation over decades,\n\n01:54.780 --> 01:57.520\n which is, well, what does life do on Earth?\n\n01:57.520 --> 01:58.640\n Why is it this way?\n\n01:58.640 --> 01:59.720\n Why is it made of cells?\n\n01:59.720 --> 02:01.320\n Why is it made of carbon?\n\n02:01.320 --> 02:06.020\n Why is it powered by electrical charges on membranes?\n\n02:06.020 --> 02:09.040\n There's all these interesting questions about cells\n\n02:09.040 --> 02:10.200\n that if you then look to see,\n\n02:10.200 --> 02:12.020\n well, is there an environment on Earth,\n\n02:12.020 --> 02:14.240\n on the early Earth four billion years ago,\n\n02:14.240 --> 02:16.720\n that kind of matches the requirements of cells?\n\n02:16.720 --> 02:17.560\n Well, there is one.\n\n02:17.560 --> 02:18.480\n There's a very obvious one.\n\n02:18.480 --> 02:21.040\n It's basically created by whenever you have\n\n02:21.040 --> 02:24.720\n a wet, rocky planet, you get these hydrothermal vents,\n\n02:24.720 --> 02:28.620\n which generate hydrogen gas in bucket loads,\n\n02:28.620 --> 02:32.480\n and electrical charges on kind of cell like pores\n\n02:32.480 --> 02:35.560\n that can drive the kind of chemistry that life does.\n\n02:35.560 --> 02:39.520\n So it seems so beautiful and so obvious\n\n02:40.480 --> 02:43.960\n that I've spent the last 10 years or more\n\n02:43.960 --> 02:45.120\n trying to do experiments.\n\n02:45.120 --> 02:47.160\n It turns out to be difficult, of course.\n\n02:47.160 --> 02:48.560\n Everything's more difficult than you ever thought\n\n02:48.560 --> 02:51.220\n it was gonna be, but it looks, I would say,\n\n02:51.220 --> 02:53.920\n more true rather than less true over that 10 year period.\n\n02:53.920 --> 02:56.320\n I think I have to take a step back every now and then\n\n02:56.320 --> 02:59.020\n and think, hang on a minute, where's this going?\n\n02:59.020 --> 03:02.000\n I'm happy it's going in a sensible direction.\n\n03:02.000 --> 03:06.580\n And I think then you have these other interesting dilemmas.\n\n03:06.580 --> 03:10.480\n I mean, I'm often accused of being too focused\n\n03:10.480 --> 03:14.880\n on life on Earth, too kind of narrow minded\n\n03:14.880 --> 03:17.080\n and inward looking, you might say.\n\n03:17.080 --> 03:18.880\n I'm talking about carbon, I'm talking about cells,\n\n03:18.880 --> 03:21.600\n and maybe you or plenty of people can say to me,\n\n03:21.600 --> 03:23.220\n ah, yeah, but life can be anything.\n\n03:23.220 --> 03:24.800\n I have no imagination.\n\n03:24.800 --> 03:26.120\n And maybe they're right.\n\n03:26.120 --> 03:29.720\n But unless we can say why life here is this way,\n\n03:29.720 --> 03:32.000\n and if those reasons are fundamental reasons,\n\n03:32.000 --> 03:33.940\n or if they're just trivial reasons,\n\n03:33.940 --> 03:36.160\n then we can't answer that question.\n\n03:36.160 --> 03:38.760\n So I think they're fundamental reasons,\n\n03:38.760 --> 03:40.340\n and I think we need to worry about them.\n\n03:40.340 --> 03:42.480\n Yeah, there might be some deep truth to the puzzle\n\n03:42.480 --> 03:44.480\n here on Earth that will resonate\n\n03:44.480 --> 03:47.400\n with other puzzles elsewhere that will,\n\n03:48.520 --> 03:50.320\n solving this particular puzzle\n\n03:50.320 --> 03:52.020\n will give us that deeper truth.\n\n03:52.020 --> 03:57.020\n So what, to this puzzle, you said vents, hydrogen,\n\n03:58.600 --> 04:03.600\n wet, so chemically, what is the potion here?\n\n04:04.440 --> 04:06.020\n How important is oxygen?\n\n04:06.020 --> 04:07.160\n You wrote a book about this.\n\n04:07.160 --> 04:09.300\n Yeah, and I actually just came straight here\n\n04:09.300 --> 04:11.080\n from a conference where I was chairing a session\n\n04:11.080 --> 04:13.880\n on whether oxygen matters or not in the history of life.\n\n04:13.880 --> 04:16.480\n Of course it matters, but it matters most\n\n04:16.480 --> 04:18.440\n to the origin of life to be not there.\n\n04:20.140 --> 04:23.000\n As I see it, we have this, I mean,\n\n04:23.000 --> 04:27.040\n life is made of carbon, basically, primarily,\n\n04:27.040 --> 04:30.280\n organic molecules with carbon, carbon bonds.\n\n04:30.280 --> 04:32.880\n And the building block, the Lego brick\n\n04:32.880 --> 04:34.920\n that we take out of the air or take out of the oceans\n\n04:34.920 --> 04:36.500\n is carbon dioxide.\n\n04:36.500 --> 04:39.620\n And to turn carbon dioxide into organic molecules,\n\n04:39.620 --> 04:42.000\n we need to strap on hydrogen.\n\n04:42.000 --> 04:43.760\n And so we need, and this is basically\n\n04:43.760 --> 04:47.480\n what life is doing, it's hydrogenating carbon dioxide.\n\n04:47.480 --> 04:49.480\n It's taking the hydrogen, the bubbles out of the earth\n\n04:49.480 --> 04:53.000\n in these hydrothermal vents, and it sticks it on CO2.\n\n04:53.000 --> 04:55.300\n And it's kind of really as simple as that.\n\n04:56.200 --> 04:58.200\n And actually, thermodynamically,\n\n04:58.200 --> 05:01.040\n there's the thing that I find most troubling\n\n05:01.040 --> 05:03.840\n is that if you do these experiments in the lab,\n\n05:03.840 --> 05:06.040\n the molecules you get are exactly the molecules\n\n05:06.040 --> 05:07.920\n that we see at the heart of biochemistry\n\n05:07.920 --> 05:08.920\n in the heart of life.\n\n05:08.920 --> 05:13.920\n Is there something to be said about the earliest origins\n\n05:14.080 --> 05:19.080\n of that little potion, that chemical process?\n\n05:21.440 --> 05:23.620\n What really is the spark there?\n\n05:24.600 --> 05:27.320\n There isn't a spark.\n\n05:28.280 --> 05:30.640\n There is a continuous chemical reaction.\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:33.120\n And there is kind of a spark,\n\n05:33.120 --> 05:35.080\n but it's a continuous electrical charge\n\n05:35.080 --> 05:37.440\n which helps drive that reaction.\n\n05:37.440 --> 05:39.040\n There's a literally spark.\n\n05:39.040 --> 05:41.560\n Well, the charge at least, but yes.\n\n05:41.560 --> 05:43.960\n I mean, a spark in that sense is,\n\n05:43.960 --> 05:46.440\n we tend to think of in terms of Frankenstein,\n\n05:46.440 --> 05:48.440\n we tend to think in terms of electricity\n\n05:48.440 --> 05:52.080\n and one moment you zap something and it comes alive.\n\n05:52.080 --> 05:53.560\n And what does that really mean?\n\n05:53.560 --> 05:56.060\n It's come alive and now what's sustaining it?\n\n05:56.060 --> 05:59.360\n Well, we are sustained by oxygen,\n\n05:59.360 --> 06:02.140\n by this continuous chemical reaction.\n\n06:02.140 --> 06:03.980\n And if you put a plastic bag on your head,\n\n06:03.980 --> 06:07.080\n then you've got a minute or something before it's all over.\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:11.000\n So some way of being able to leverage a source of energy.\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:12.720\n Well, the source of energy at the origin of life\n\n06:12.720 --> 06:15.720\n is the reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrogen.\n\n06:15.720 --> 06:19.320\n And amazingly, most of these reactions are exergonic,\n\n06:19.320 --> 06:21.760\n which is to say they release energy.\n\n06:21.760 --> 06:24.280\n If you have hydrogen and CO2\n\n06:24.280 --> 06:26.240\n and you put them together in a falcon tube\n\n06:26.240 --> 06:28.320\n and you warm it up to say 50 degrees centigrade\n\n06:28.320 --> 06:31.000\n and you put in a couple of catalysts and you shake it,\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:32.320\n nothing's gonna happen.\n\n06:32.320 --> 06:35.800\n But thermodynamically, that is less stable.\n\n06:35.800 --> 06:39.240\n Two gases, hydrogen and CO2, is less stable than cells.\n\n06:39.240 --> 06:42.080\n What should happen is you get cells coming out.\n\n06:43.800 --> 06:45.480\n So why doesn't that happen?\n\n06:45.480 --> 06:47.800\n It's because of the kinetic barriers.\n\n06:47.800 --> 06:49.960\n That's where you need the spark.\n\n06:49.960 --> 06:52.040\n Is it possible that life originated\n\n06:52.040 --> 06:54.080\n multiple times on Earth?\n\n06:54.080 --> 06:57.600\n The way you describe it, you make it sound so easy.\n\n06:57.600 --> 07:01.240\n There's a long distance to go from the first bits\n\n07:01.240 --> 07:04.160\n of prebiotic chemistry to, say, molecular machines\n\n07:04.160 --> 07:05.360\n like ribosomes.\n\n07:05.360 --> 07:09.440\n Is that the first thing that you would say is life?\n\n07:09.440 --> 07:12.640\n Like if I introduce you, the two of you at a party,\n\n07:12.640 --> 07:15.040\n you would say that's a living thing?\n\n07:15.040 --> 07:19.920\n I would say as soon as we introduce genes, information,\n\n07:19.920 --> 07:22.040\n into systems that are growing anyway,\n\n07:22.040 --> 07:25.240\n so I would talk about growing protocells,\n\n07:25.240 --> 07:30.080\n as soon as we introduce even random bits of information\n\n07:30.080 --> 07:35.040\n into there, I'm thinking about RNA molecules, for example,\n\n07:35.040 --> 07:36.400\n doesn't have to have any information in it.\n\n07:36.400 --> 07:38.200\n It can be a completely random sequence.\n\n07:38.200 --> 07:41.120\n But if it's introduced into a system which is in any case\n\n07:41.120 --> 07:43.600\n growing and doubling itself and reproducing itself,\n\n07:43.600 --> 07:46.320\n then any changes in that sequence that allow it\n\n07:46.320 --> 07:48.880\n to do so better or worse are now selected\n\n07:48.880 --> 07:51.200\n by perfectly normal natural selection.\n\n07:51.200 --> 07:52.280\n But it's a system.\n\n07:52.280 --> 07:54.560\n So that's when it becomes alive to my mind.\n\n07:54.560 --> 07:59.320\n That's encompassed into like an object\n\n08:00.240 --> 08:03.960\n that keeps information and evolves that information\n\n08:03.960 --> 08:06.440\n over time or changes that information over time\n\n08:06.440 --> 08:07.280\n in response to the.\n\n08:07.280 --> 08:10.000\n So it's always part of a cell system\n\n08:10.000 --> 08:11.160\n from the very beginning.\n\n08:11.160 --> 08:14.320\n So is your sense that it started only once\n\n08:14.320 --> 08:16.800\n because it's difficult or is it possibly started\n\n08:16.800 --> 08:18.680\n in multiple locations on Earth?\n\n08:18.680 --> 08:20.880\n It's possible it started multiple occasions.\n\n08:22.240 --> 08:23.680\n There's two provisos to that.\n\n08:23.680 --> 08:28.680\n One of them is oxygen makes it impossible really\n\n08:28.840 --> 08:29.840\n for life to start.\n\n08:29.840 --> 08:31.840\n So as soon as we've got oxygen in the atmosphere,\n\n08:31.840 --> 08:34.280\n then life isn't gonna keep starting over.\n\n08:34.280 --> 08:36.360\n So I often get asked by people,\n\n08:36.360 --> 08:37.960\n why can't we have life starting?\n\n08:37.960 --> 08:40.600\n If it's so easy, why can't life start in these vents now?\n\n08:40.600 --> 08:43.720\n And the answer is if you want hydrogen to react with CO2\n\n08:43.720 --> 08:45.240\n and there's oxygen there, hydrogen reacts\n\n08:45.240 --> 08:46.120\n with oxygen instead.\n\n08:46.120 --> 08:48.800\n It's just, you get an explosive reaction that way.\n\n08:48.800 --> 08:50.040\n It's rocket fuel.\n\n08:50.040 --> 08:51.240\n So it's never gonna happen.\n\n08:51.240 --> 08:54.120\n But for the origin of life earlier than that,\n\n08:54.120 --> 08:57.280\n all we know is that there's a single common ancestor\n\n08:57.280 --> 08:58.120\n for all of life.\n\n08:58.120 --> 09:00.120\n There could have been multiple origins\n\n09:00.120 --> 09:02.000\n and they all just disappeared.\n\n09:02.000 --> 09:06.160\n But there's a very interesting deep split in life\n\n09:06.160 --> 09:09.000\n between bacteria and what are called archaea,\n\n09:09.000 --> 09:11.280\n which look just the same as bacteria.\n\n09:12.240 --> 09:14.880\n And they're not quite as diverse, but nearly.\n\n09:14.880 --> 09:18.120\n And they are very different in their biochemistry.\n\n09:18.120 --> 09:19.800\n And so any explanation for the origin of life\n\n09:19.800 --> 09:22.840\n has to account as well for why they're so different\n\n09:22.840 --> 09:24.160\n and yet so similar.\n\n09:24.160 --> 09:27.240\n And that makes me think that life probably\n\n09:27.240 --> 09:29.160\n did arise only once.\n\n09:29.160 --> 09:31.960\n Can you describe the difference that's interesting there?\n\n09:31.960 --> 09:34.000\n Well, how they're similar, how they're different?\n\n09:34.000 --> 09:38.120\n Well, they're different in their membranes primarily.\n\n09:38.120 --> 09:40.360\n They're different in things like DNA replication.\n\n09:40.360 --> 09:41.840\n They use completely different enzymes\n\n09:41.840 --> 09:44.640\n and the genes behind it for replicating DNA.\n\n09:44.640 --> 09:47.960\n So they both have membranes, both have DNA replication.\n\n09:47.960 --> 09:48.800\n Yes.\n\n09:48.800 --> 09:50.240\n The process of that is different.\n\n09:50.240 --> 09:52.040\n They both have DNA.\n\n09:52.040 --> 09:54.840\n The genetic code is identical in them both.\n\n09:54.840 --> 09:58.560\n The way in which it's transcribed into RNA,\n\n09:58.560 --> 10:00.960\n into the copy of a gene,\n\n10:00.960 --> 10:03.280\n and the way that that's then translated into a protein,\n\n10:03.280 --> 10:05.320\n that's all basically the same in both of these groups.\n\n10:05.320 --> 10:08.560\n So they clearly share a common ancestor.\n\n10:08.560 --> 10:09.640\n It's just that they're different\n\n10:09.640 --> 10:10.960\n in fundamental ways as well.\n\n10:10.960 --> 10:11.800\n And if you think about, well,\n\n10:11.800 --> 10:15.440\n what kind of processes could drive that divergence\n\n10:15.440 --> 10:16.520\n very early on?\n\n10:18.040 --> 10:19.760\n I can think about it in terms of membranes,\n\n10:19.760 --> 10:22.640\n in terms of the electrical charges on membranes.\n\n10:22.640 --> 10:25.800\n And it's that that makes me think that there was probably,\n\n10:25.800 --> 10:27.480\n there were probably many unsuccessful attempts\n\n10:27.480 --> 10:30.080\n but only one really successful attempt.\n\n10:30.080 --> 10:31.920\n Can you explain why that divergence\n\n10:31.920 --> 10:36.240\n makes you think there's one common ancestor?\n\n10:36.240 --> 10:38.040\n Okay, can you describe that intuition?\n\n10:38.040 --> 10:40.440\n I'm a little bit unclear about why the divert,\n\n10:40.440 --> 10:43.840\n like the leap from the divergence means there's one.\n\n10:43.840 --> 10:47.040\n Do you mean like the divergence indicates\n\n10:47.040 --> 10:52.040\n that there was a big invention at that time from one source?\n\n10:52.280 --> 10:54.720\n If you'd got, as I imagine it,\n\n10:54.720 --> 10:59.160\n you have a common ancestor living in a hydrothermal vent.\n\n10:59.160 --> 11:01.480\n Let's say there are millions of vents\n\n11:01.480 --> 11:04.160\n and millions of potential common ancestors\n\n11:04.160 --> 11:06.080\n living in all of those vents,\n\n11:06.080 --> 11:09.520\n but only one of them makes it out first.\n\n11:09.520 --> 11:11.200\n Then you could imagine that that cell\n\n11:11.200 --> 11:12.720\n is then gonna kind of take over the world\n\n11:12.720 --> 11:14.480\n and wipe out everything else.\n\n11:14.480 --> 11:16.600\n And so what you would see would be\n\n11:16.600 --> 11:18.960\n a single common ancestor for all of life.\n\n11:18.960 --> 11:21.520\n But with lots of different vent systems\n\n11:21.520 --> 11:24.720\n all kind of vying to create the first life forms,\n\n11:24.720 --> 11:25.560\n you might say.\n\n11:25.560 --> 11:28.920\n So this thing is a cell, a single cell organism.\n\n11:28.920 --> 11:32.000\n We're always talking about populations of cells, but yes.\n\n11:32.000 --> 11:33.760\n These are single celled organisms.\n\n11:33.760 --> 11:37.800\n But the fundamental life form is a single cell, right?\n\n11:37.800 --> 11:41.960\n So like, or, so they're always together\n\n11:41.960 --> 11:44.000\n but they're alone together.\n\n11:44.000 --> 11:44.840\n Yeah.\n\n11:44.840 --> 11:47.800\n There's a machinery in each one individual component\n\n11:47.800 --> 11:50.800\n that if left by itself would still work, right?\n\n11:50.800 --> 11:51.680\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n11:51.680 --> 11:54.560\n It's the unit of selection is a single cell.\n\n11:54.560 --> 11:56.680\n But selection operates over generations\n\n11:56.680 --> 11:59.520\n and changes over generations in populations of cells.\n\n11:59.520 --> 12:01.280\n So it would be impossible to say that a cell\n\n12:01.280 --> 12:03.400\n is the unit of selection in the sense that\n\n12:04.280 --> 12:06.000\n unless you have a population, you can't evolve,\n\n12:06.000 --> 12:07.360\n you can't change.\n\n12:07.360 --> 12:12.280\n Right, but there was one Chuck Norris,\n\n12:12.280 --> 12:15.360\n it's an American reference cell\n\n12:15.360 --> 12:17.840\n that made it out of the vents, right?\n\n12:17.840 --> 12:19.760\n Or like the first one.\n\n12:19.760 --> 12:22.080\n So imagine then that there's one cell gets out\n\n12:22.080 --> 12:23.640\n and it takes over the world.\n\n12:23.640 --> 12:25.600\n It gets out in the water, it's like floating around.\n\n12:25.600 --> 12:27.200\n We're deep in the ocean somewhere.\n\n12:27.200 --> 12:28.040\n Yeah.\n\n12:28.040 --> 12:31.240\n But actually two cells got out\n\n12:31.240 --> 12:35.480\n and they appear to have got out from the same vent\n\n12:35.480 --> 12:38.720\n because they both share the same code and everything else.\n\n12:38.720 --> 12:40.160\n So unless all the, you know,\n\n12:40.160 --> 12:42.200\n we've got a million different common ancestors\n\n12:42.200 --> 12:44.160\n in all these different vents.\n\n12:44.160 --> 12:47.000\n So either they all have the same code\n\n12:47.000 --> 12:49.360\n and two cells spontaneously merge from different places\n\n12:49.360 --> 12:54.120\n or two different cells, fundamentally different cells\n\n12:54.120 --> 12:55.720\n came from the same place.\n\n12:55.720 --> 12:59.280\n So either way, what are the constraints that say,\n\n12:59.280 --> 13:01.640\n not just one came out or not half a million came out,\n\n13:01.640 --> 13:03.320\n but two came out.\n\n13:03.320 --> 13:05.280\n That's kind of a bit strange.\n\n13:05.280 --> 13:06.520\n So how did they come out?\n\n13:06.520 --> 13:09.760\n Well, they come out because what are you doing inside a vent\n\n13:09.760 --> 13:12.680\n is you're relying on the electrical charges down there\n\n13:12.680 --> 13:15.480\n to power this reaction between hydrogen and CO2\n\n13:15.480 --> 13:16.960\n to make yourself grow.\n\n13:16.960 --> 13:19.200\n And when you leave the vent, you've got to do that yourself.\n\n13:19.200 --> 13:21.280\n You've got to power up your own membrane.\n\n13:21.280 --> 13:22.120\n And so the question is,\n\n13:22.120 --> 13:24.800\n well, how do you power up your own membrane?\n\n13:24.800 --> 13:27.240\n And the answer is, well, you need to pump.\n\n13:27.240 --> 13:29.920\n You need to pump ions to give an electrical charge\n\n13:29.920 --> 13:30.800\n on the membrane.\n\n13:30.800 --> 13:32.160\n So what do the pumps look like?\n\n13:32.160 --> 13:35.320\n Well, the pumps look different in these two groups.\n\n13:35.320 --> 13:37.960\n It's as if they both emerged from a common ancestor.\n\n13:37.960 --> 13:39.400\n As soon as you've got that ancestor,\n\n13:39.400 --> 13:43.800\n things move very quickly and divergently.\n\n13:43.800 --> 13:45.840\n Why does the DNA replication look different?\n\n13:45.840 --> 13:47.280\n Well, it's joined to the membrane.\n\n13:47.280 --> 13:48.280\n The membranes are different.\n\n13:48.280 --> 13:49.680\n The DNA replication is different\n\n13:49.680 --> 13:52.360\n because it's joined to a different kind of membrane.\n\n13:52.360 --> 13:55.600\n So there's interesting, this is detail, you may say,\n\n13:55.600 --> 13:57.080\n but it's also fundamental\n\n13:57.080 --> 13:59.680\n because it's about the two big divergent groups\n\n13:59.680 --> 14:02.960\n of life on Earth that seem to have diverged really early on.\n\n14:02.960 --> 14:06.560\n And it all started from one organism.\n\n14:06.560 --> 14:09.600\n And then that organism just start replicating\n\n14:09.600 --> 14:14.320\n the heck out of itself with some mutation of the DNA.\n\n14:14.320 --> 14:17.480\n So like there's some, there's a competition\n\n14:17.480 --> 14:19.400\n through the process of evolution.\n\n14:19.400 --> 14:21.400\n They're not like trying to beat each other up.\n\n14:21.400 --> 14:24.160\n They're just, they're just trying to live.\n\n14:24.160 --> 14:25.680\n Just replicate us.\n\n14:25.680 --> 14:26.520\n Yeah.\n\n14:26.520 --> 14:28.560\n Well, you know, let's not minimize there.\n\n14:28.560 --> 14:29.400\n Yeah.\n\n14:29.400 --> 14:30.320\n They're just trying to chill.\n\n14:30.320 --> 14:32.240\n They're trying to relax up.\n\n14:32.240 --> 14:35.120\n There's no, but there's no sense of trying to survive.\n\n14:35.120 --> 14:36.440\n They're replicating.\n\n14:36.440 --> 14:37.360\n I mean, there's no sense\n\n14:37.360 --> 14:39.600\n in which they're trying to do anything.\n\n14:39.600 --> 14:42.000\n They're just kind of an outgrowth of the Earth,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:42.840\n you might say.\n\n14:42.840 --> 14:44.760\n Of course, the aliens would describe us humans\n\n14:44.760 --> 14:45.680\n in that same way.\n\n14:45.680 --> 14:47.280\n They might be right.\n\n14:47.280 --> 14:48.640\n This primitive life.\n\n14:48.640 --> 14:52.440\n It's just ants that are hairless,\n\n14:52.440 --> 14:53.360\n mostly hairless.\n\n14:53.360 --> 14:54.360\n Overgrown ants.\n\n14:54.360 --> 14:55.600\n Overgrown ants.\n\n14:55.600 --> 14:56.800\n Okay.\n\n14:56.800 --> 14:59.360\n What do you think about the idea of panspermia\n\n14:59.360 --> 15:03.400\n that the theory that life did not originate on Earth\n\n15:03.400 --> 15:06.880\n and was planted here from outer space?\n\n15:06.880 --> 15:10.640\n Or pseudopanspermia, which is like the basic ingredients,\n\n15:10.640 --> 15:12.920\n the magic that you mentioned was planted here\n\n15:12.920 --> 15:14.680\n from elsewhere in space?\n\n15:14.680 --> 15:16.360\n I don't find them helpful.\n\n15:16.360 --> 15:17.880\n That's not to say they're wrong.\n\n15:18.800 --> 15:22.320\n So, pseudotranspermia, the idea that the chemicals,\n\n15:22.320 --> 15:23.880\n the amino acids, the nucleotides\n\n15:23.880 --> 15:24.800\n are being delivered from space.\n\n15:24.800 --> 15:25.800\n Well, we know that happens.\n\n15:25.800 --> 15:27.080\n It's unequivocal.\n\n15:27.080 --> 15:29.560\n They're delivered on meteorites, comets, and so on.\n\n15:30.840 --> 15:31.800\n So what do they do next?\n\n15:31.800 --> 15:33.120\n That's, to me, the question.\n\n15:33.120 --> 15:35.120\n Well, what do they do is they stock a soup.\n\n15:35.120 --> 15:37.440\n Presumably, they land in a pond or in an ocean\n\n15:37.440 --> 15:39.000\n or wherever they land.\n\n15:39.000 --> 15:42.120\n And then you end up with a best possible case scenario\n\n15:42.120 --> 15:43.880\n is you end up with a soup of nucleotides\n\n15:43.880 --> 15:44.720\n and amino acids.\n\n15:44.720 --> 15:46.400\n And then you have to say, so now what happens?\n\n15:46.400 --> 15:48.200\n And the answer is, oh, well, they have to go,\n\n15:48.200 --> 15:50.760\n bloop, become alive.\n\n15:50.760 --> 15:51.720\n So how did they do that?\n\n15:51.720 --> 15:54.720\n And you may as well say then a miracle happened.\n\n15:54.720 --> 15:57.080\n I don't believe in soup.\n\n15:57.080 --> 16:00.680\n I think what we have in event is a continuous conversion,\n\n16:00.680 --> 16:02.680\n a continuous growth, a continuous reaction,\n\n16:02.680 --> 16:05.880\n a continuous converting a flow of molecules\n\n16:05.880 --> 16:07.880\n into more of yourself, you might say,\n\n16:07.880 --> 16:08.840\n even if it's a small bit.\n\n16:08.840 --> 16:13.000\n So you've got a kind of continuous self organization\n\n16:13.000 --> 16:14.760\n and growth from the very beginning.\n\n16:14.760 --> 16:17.000\n You never have that in a soup.\n\n16:17.000 --> 16:20.440\n Isn't the entire universe and living organisms\n\n16:20.440 --> 16:25.000\n in the universe, isn't it just soup all the way down?\n\n16:25.000 --> 16:25.840\n Isn't it all soup?\n\n16:25.840 --> 16:27.760\n No, no, I mean, soup almost by definition\n\n16:27.760 --> 16:29.560\n doesn't have a structure.\n\n16:29.560 --> 16:32.200\n But soup is a collection of ingredients\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:34.040\n that are like randomly interacting.\n\n16:34.040 --> 16:36.200\n Yeah, but they're not random.\n\n16:36.200 --> 16:38.760\n They're not, I mean, we have chemistry going on here.\n\n16:38.760 --> 16:41.160\n We have metal grains forming, which are, you know,\n\n16:41.160 --> 16:43.400\n effective oil water interactions.\n\n16:43.400 --> 16:45.960\n Okay, so it feels like there's a direction to a process,\n\n16:45.960 --> 16:47.400\n like a directed process.\n\n16:47.400 --> 16:49.920\n There are directions to processes, yeah.\n\n16:49.920 --> 16:52.640\n And if you're starting with CO2\n\n16:52.640 --> 16:55.600\n and you've got two reactive fluids being brought together\n\n16:55.600 --> 16:57.720\n and they react, what are they gonna make?\n\n16:57.720 --> 16:59.880\n Well, they make carboxylic acids,\n\n16:59.880 --> 17:01.720\n which include the fatty acids\n\n17:01.720 --> 17:03.040\n that make up the cell membranes.\n\n17:03.040 --> 17:06.520\n And they form directly into bilayer membranes.\n\n17:06.520 --> 17:07.720\n They form like soap bubbles.\n\n17:07.720 --> 17:11.240\n It's spontaneous organization caused by the nature\n\n17:11.240 --> 17:12.080\n of the molecules.\n\n17:12.080 --> 17:14.040\n And those things are capable of growing\n\n17:14.040 --> 17:16.440\n and are capable in effect of being selected\n\n17:16.440 --> 17:18.320\n even before there are genes.\n\n17:18.320 --> 17:20.080\n We have this, so we have a lot of order\n\n17:20.080 --> 17:22.560\n and that order is coming from thermodynamics.\n\n17:22.560 --> 17:25.400\n And the thermodynamics is always about increasing\n\n17:25.400 --> 17:27.040\n the entropy of the universe.\n\n17:27.040 --> 17:30.480\n But if you have oil and water and they're separating,\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:32.040\n you're increasing the entropy of the universe,\n\n17:32.040 --> 17:33.160\n even though you've got some order,\n\n17:33.160 --> 17:36.520\n which is the soap and the water are not missable.\n\n17:36.520 --> 17:39.480\n Now, to come back to your first question\n\n17:39.480 --> 17:42.360\n about panspermia properly,\n\n17:43.840 --> 17:45.440\n that just pushes the question somewhere else.\n\n17:45.440 --> 17:46.840\n That just, even if it's true,\n\n17:46.840 --> 17:49.680\n maybe life did start on Earth by panspermia.\n\n17:49.680 --> 17:52.200\n So what are the principles\n\n17:52.200 --> 17:55.200\n that govern the emergence of life on any planet?\n\n17:55.200 --> 17:57.560\n It's an assumption that life started here.\n\n17:57.560 --> 18:01.000\n And it's an assumption that it started\n\n18:01.000 --> 18:02.760\n in a hydrothermal vent or it started\n\n18:02.760 --> 18:04.680\n in a terrestrial geothermal system.\n\n18:04.680 --> 18:07.560\n The question is, can we work out a testable sequence\n\n18:07.560 --> 18:10.440\n of events that would lead from one to the other one\n\n18:10.440 --> 18:12.640\n and then test it and see if there's any truth in it or not?\n\n18:12.640 --> 18:14.880\n With panspermia, you can't do any of that.\n\n18:14.880 --> 18:17.680\n But the fundamental question of panspermia is,\n\n18:17.680 --> 18:21.920\n do we have the machine here on Earth to build life?\n\n18:23.040 --> 18:25.680\n Is the vents enough?\n\n18:25.680 --> 18:30.680\n Is oxygen and hydrogen and whatever the heck else we want\n\n18:31.720 --> 18:34.520\n and some source of energy and heat,\n\n18:34.520 --> 18:36.320\n is that enough to build life?\n\n18:36.320 --> 18:37.280\n Yes.\n\n18:37.280 --> 18:41.480\n Well, that's, of course you would say that as a human.\n\n18:41.480 --> 18:42.800\n Yeah.\n\n18:42.800 --> 18:44.640\n But there could be aliens right now\n\n18:44.640 --> 18:46.160\n chuckling at that idea.\n\n18:46.160 --> 18:50.600\n Maybe you need some special sauce,\n\n18:50.600 --> 18:52.040\n special elsewhere sauce.\n\n18:52.040 --> 18:54.600\n So your sense is we have everything here.\n\n18:54.600 --> 18:57.280\n I mean, this is precisely the question.\n\n18:57.280 --> 18:59.600\n I like to, when I'm talking in schools,\n\n18:59.600 --> 19:00.800\n I like to start out with the idea\n\n19:00.800 --> 19:03.240\n of we can make a time machine.\n\n19:03.240 --> 19:05.120\n We go back four billion years\n\n19:05.120 --> 19:07.400\n and we go to these environments that people talk about.\n\n19:07.400 --> 19:09.280\n We go to a deep sea hydrothermal vent,\n\n19:09.280 --> 19:14.120\n we go to a kind of Yellowstone Park type place environment\n\n19:14.120 --> 19:18.560\n and we find some slime that looks like we can test it.\n\n19:18.560 --> 19:20.240\n It's made of organic molecules.\n\n19:20.240 --> 19:22.400\n It's got a structure which is not obviously cells,\n\n19:22.400 --> 19:25.640\n but you know, is this a stepping stone\n\n19:25.640 --> 19:26.880\n on the way to life or not?\n\n19:26.880 --> 19:27.720\n Yeah.\n\n19:27.720 --> 19:29.080\n How do we know?\n\n19:29.080 --> 19:31.600\n Unless we've got an intellectual framework\n\n19:31.600 --> 19:34.200\n that says this is a stepping stone and that's not a step.\n\n19:34.200 --> 19:35.040\n You know, we'd never know.\n\n19:35.040 --> 19:36.520\n We wouldn't know which environment to go to,\n\n19:36.520 --> 19:38.560\n what to look for, how to say this.\n\n19:38.560 --> 19:39.920\n So all we can ever hope for,\n\n19:39.920 --> 19:41.880\n because we're never gonna build that time machine,\n\n19:41.880 --> 19:43.440\n is to have an intellectual framework\n\n19:43.440 --> 19:46.880\n that can explain step by step, experiment by experiment,\n\n19:46.880 --> 19:49.680\n how we go from a sterile inorganic planet\n\n19:49.680 --> 19:52.480\n to living cells as we know them.\n\n19:52.480 --> 19:55.280\n And in that framework, every time you have a choice,\n\n19:55.280 --> 19:57.000\n it could be this way or it could be that way,\n\n19:57.000 --> 20:02.000\n or there's lots of possible forks down that road.\n\n20:02.320 --> 20:03.640\n Did it have to be that way?\n\n20:03.640 --> 20:05.240\n Could it have been the other way?\n\n20:05.240 --> 20:06.560\n And would that have given you life\n\n20:06.560 --> 20:08.840\n with very different properties?\n\n20:08.840 --> 20:11.080\n And so if you come up with a, you know,\n\n20:11.080 --> 20:12.720\n it's a long hypothesis, because as I say,\n\n20:12.720 --> 20:15.560\n we're going from really simple prebiotic chemistry\n\n20:15.560 --> 20:17.840\n all the way through to genes and molecular machines.\n\n20:17.840 --> 20:20.160\n That's a long, long pathway.\n\n20:20.160 --> 20:22.320\n And nobody in the field would agree on the order\n\n20:22.320 --> 20:23.760\n in which these things happened,\n\n20:23.760 --> 20:24.600\n which is not a bad thing,\n\n20:24.600 --> 20:25.800\n because it means that you have to go out\n\n20:25.800 --> 20:27.840\n and do some experiments and try and demonstrate\n\n20:27.840 --> 20:29.840\n that it's possible or not possible.\n\n20:29.840 --> 20:34.840\n It's so freaking amazing that it happened though.\n\n20:37.440 --> 20:41.920\n It feels like there's a direction to the thing.\n\n20:41.920 --> 20:46.920\n Can you try to answer from a framework perspective\n\n20:47.600 --> 20:49.640\n of what is life?\n\n20:49.640 --> 20:54.640\n So you said there's some order and yet there's complexity.\n\n20:57.240 --> 20:59.160\n So it's not perfectly ordered.\n\n20:59.160 --> 21:00.360\n It's not boring.\n\n21:00.360 --> 21:02.040\n There's still some fun in it.\n\n21:02.040 --> 21:05.400\n And it also feels like the processes have a direction\n\n21:06.280 --> 21:07.920\n through the selection mechanism.\n\n21:07.920 --> 21:10.640\n They seem to be building something,\n\n21:10.640 --> 21:14.280\n always better, always improving.\n\n21:14.280 --> 21:15.120\n I mean, maybe it's...\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:16.280\n I mean, that's a perception.\n\n21:16.280 --> 21:19.560\n That's our romanticization of things are always better.\n\n21:20.720 --> 21:22.920\n Things are getting better, we'd like to believe that.\n\n21:22.920 --> 21:24.120\n I mean, you think about the world\n\n21:24.120 --> 21:25.680\n from the point of view of bacteria\n\n21:25.680 --> 21:28.000\n and bacteria are the first things to emerge\n\n21:28.000 --> 21:30.080\n from whatever environment they came from.\n\n21:30.080 --> 21:32.760\n And they dominated the planet very, very quickly.\n\n21:32.760 --> 21:34.480\n And they haven't really changed.\n\n21:34.480 --> 21:36.680\n Four billion years later, they look exactly the same.\n\n21:36.680 --> 21:38.800\n So about four billion years ago,\n\n21:38.800 --> 21:42.440\n bacteria started to really run the show.\n\n21:42.440 --> 21:44.720\n And then nothing happened for a while.\n\n21:44.720 --> 21:47.000\n Nothing happened for two billion years.\n\n21:47.000 --> 21:48.160\n Then after two billion years,\n\n21:48.160 --> 21:51.440\n we see another single event origin, if you like,\n\n21:51.440 --> 21:53.960\n of our own type of cell, the eukaryotic cells.\n\n21:53.960 --> 21:57.280\n So cells with a nucleus and lots of stuff going on inside.\n\n21:57.280 --> 21:58.480\n Another singular origin.\n\n21:58.480 --> 22:01.120\n It only happened once in the history of life on earth.\n\n22:01.120 --> 22:03.360\n Maybe it happened multiple times and there's no evidence.\n\n22:03.360 --> 22:04.360\n Everything just disappeared,\n\n22:04.360 --> 22:07.520\n but we have to at least take it seriously\n\n22:07.520 --> 22:10.040\n that there's something that stops bacteria\n\n22:10.040 --> 22:13.600\n from becoming more complex because they didn't.\n\n22:13.600 --> 22:17.520\n That's a fact that they emerged four billion years ago.\n\n22:17.520 --> 22:19.400\n And something happened two billion years ago,\n\n22:19.400 --> 22:21.320\n but the bacteria themselves didn't change.\n\n22:21.320 --> 22:22.560\n They remain bacterial.\n\n22:22.560 --> 22:26.120\n So there is no trajectory, necessary trajectory\n\n22:26.120 --> 22:28.640\n towards great complexity in human beings at the end of it.\n\n22:28.640 --> 22:31.360\n It's very easy to imagine that without photosynthesis\n\n22:31.360 --> 22:33.060\n arising or without eukaryotes arising,\n\n22:33.060 --> 22:36.400\n that a planet could be full of bacteria and nothing else.\n\n22:36.400 --> 22:39.360\n We'll get to that because that's a brilliant invention.\n\n22:39.360 --> 22:41.560\n And there's a few brilliant invention along the way.\n\n22:41.560 --> 22:44.040\n But what is life?\n\n22:44.040 --> 22:46.000\n If you were to show up on earth,\n\n22:46.000 --> 22:47.840\n but to take that time machine,\n\n22:47.840 --> 22:50.300\n and you said, asking yourself the question,\n\n22:50.300 --> 22:52.760\n is this a stepping stone towards life?\n\n22:52.760 --> 22:57.040\n As you step along, when you see the early bacteria,\n\n22:57.040 --> 22:58.520\n how would you know it's life?\n\n22:59.640 --> 23:01.800\n And then this is really important question\n\n23:01.800 --> 23:04.640\n when you go to other planets and look for life.\n\n23:04.640 --> 23:08.280\n Like what is the framework of telling a difference\n\n23:08.280 --> 23:12.280\n between a rock and a bacteria?\n\n23:12.280 --> 23:15.280\n I mean, the question's kind of both impossible to answer\n\n23:15.280 --> 23:16.540\n and trivial at the same time.\n\n23:16.540 --> 23:18.140\n And I don't like to answer it\n\n23:18.140 --> 23:19.680\n because I don't think there is an answer.\n\n23:19.680 --> 23:22.080\n I think we're trying to describe the process of time.\n\n23:22.080 --> 23:22.920\n Those are the most fun questions.\n\n23:22.920 --> 23:23.760\n What do you mean there's no answer?\n\n23:23.760 --> 23:24.580\n No, there is no answer.\n\n23:24.580 --> 23:25.420\n I mean, there's lots of,\n\n23:25.420 --> 23:27.860\n there are at least 40 or 50 different definitions\n\n23:27.860 --> 23:29.000\n of life out there.\n\n23:29.000 --> 23:33.040\n And most of them are, well, obviously bad\n\n23:33.040 --> 23:34.080\n in one way or another.\n\n23:34.080 --> 23:37.120\n I mean, there's freaks.\n\n23:37.120 --> 23:39.920\n I can never remember the exact words that people use,\n\n23:39.920 --> 23:43.720\n but there's a NASA working definition of life,\n\n23:43.720 --> 23:46.000\n which more or less says a system,\n\n23:46.000 --> 23:49.560\n which is capable of self sustaining system,\n\n23:49.560 --> 23:52.680\n capable of evolution or something along those lines.\n\n23:52.680 --> 23:54.600\n And I immediately have a problem\n\n23:54.600 --> 23:56.200\n with the word self sustaining\n\n23:56.200 --> 23:58.240\n because it's sustained by the environment.\n\n23:58.240 --> 24:00.120\n And I know what they're getting at.\n\n24:00.120 --> 24:01.000\n I know what they're trying to say,\n\n24:01.000 --> 24:03.120\n but I pick a hole in that.\n\n24:03.120 --> 24:04.720\n And there's always wags who say,\n\n24:04.720 --> 24:07.360\n but you know, by that definition, a rabbit is not alive.\n\n24:07.360 --> 24:09.800\n Only a pair of rabbits would be alive\n\n24:09.800 --> 24:12.880\n because a single rabbit is incapable of copying itself.\n\n24:12.880 --> 24:16.080\n There's all kinds of pedantic, silly,\n\n24:16.080 --> 24:19.280\n but also important objections to any hypothesis.\n\n24:19.280 --> 24:22.280\n The real question is what is, you know,\n\n24:22.280 --> 24:24.920\n we can argue all day or people do argue all day\n\n24:24.920 --> 24:27.440\n about is a virus alive or not?\n\n24:27.440 --> 24:29.120\n And it depends on the content.\n\n24:29.120 --> 24:31.360\n Most biologists could not agree about that.\n\n24:31.360 --> 24:32.720\n So then what about a jumping gene,\n\n24:32.720 --> 24:34.920\n a retro element or something that is even simpler\n\n24:34.920 --> 24:39.600\n than a virus, but it's capable of converting\n\n24:39.600 --> 24:41.840\n its environment into a copy of itself.\n\n24:42.920 --> 24:45.200\n And that's about as close, this is not a definition,\n\n24:45.200 --> 24:47.440\n but this is a kind of a description of life\n\n24:47.440 --> 24:52.080\n is that it's able to parasitize the environment.\n\n24:52.080 --> 24:53.920\n And that goes for plants as well as animals\n\n24:53.920 --> 24:58.920\n and bacteria and viruses to make a relatively exact copy\n\n24:58.920 --> 25:03.920\n of themselves, informationally exact copy of themselves.\n\n25:04.120 --> 25:06.160\n By the way, it doesn't really have to be\n\n25:06.160 --> 25:07.680\n a copy of itself, right?\n\n25:07.680 --> 25:10.320\n It just has to be, you have to create something\n\n25:11.480 --> 25:16.400\n that's interesting, the way evolution is.\n\n25:16.400 --> 25:19.920\n So it is extremely powerful process of evolution,\n\n25:19.920 --> 25:22.360\n which is basically make a copy of yourself\n\n25:22.360 --> 25:25.080\n and sometimes mess up a little bit.\n\n25:25.080 --> 25:26.440\n That seems to work really well.\n\n25:26.440 --> 25:30.360\n I wonder if it's possible to mess up big time\n\n25:30.360 --> 25:32.360\n as a standard, as a default.\n\n25:32.360 --> 25:36.880\n It's called a hopeful monster and in principle it can.\n\n25:36.880 --> 25:40.520\n Actually, it turns out, I would say that this is due\n\n25:40.520 --> 25:43.200\n a reemergence, this is some amazing work\n\n25:43.200 --> 25:45.320\n from Michael Levin, I don't know if you came across him,\n\n25:45.320 --> 25:47.360\n but if you haven't interviewed him,\n\n25:47.360 --> 25:50.800\n you should interview him about, yeah.\n\n25:50.800 --> 25:53.640\n I'm talking to him in a few days.\n\n25:53.640 --> 25:54.480\n Oh, fantastic.\n\n25:54.480 --> 25:59.320\n So I mentioned, there's two people that Andre,\n\n25:59.320 --> 26:02.360\n if I may mention, Andre Kapathe is a friend\n\n26:02.360 --> 26:04.600\n who's really admired in the AI community,\n\n26:04.600 --> 26:09.600\n said you absolutely must talk to Michael and to Nick.\n\n26:09.680 --> 26:11.800\n So of course, I'm a huge fan of yours,\n\n26:11.800 --> 26:14.120\n so I'm really fortunate that we can actually\n\n26:14.120 --> 26:14.960\n make this happen.\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:16.080\n Anyway, you were saying?\n\n26:16.080 --> 26:19.280\n Well, Michael Levin is doing amazing work,\n\n26:19.280 --> 26:22.160\n basically about the way in which electrical fields\n\n26:22.160 --> 26:25.640\n control development and he's done some work\n\n26:25.640 --> 26:27.880\n with planarian worms, so flat worms,\n\n26:27.880 --> 26:29.400\n where he'll tell you all about this,\n\n26:29.400 --> 26:30.800\n so I won't say any more than the minimum,\n\n26:30.800 --> 26:32.440\n but basically you can cut their head off\n\n26:32.440 --> 26:35.640\n and they'll redevelop a different, a new head.\n\n26:35.640 --> 26:37.680\n But the head that they develop depends,\n\n26:37.680 --> 26:42.520\n if you knock out just one iron pump in a membrane,\n\n26:42.520 --> 26:45.240\n so you change the electrical circuitry just a little bit,\n\n26:45.240 --> 26:47.000\n you can come up with a completely different head.\n\n26:47.000 --> 26:49.600\n It can be a head which is similar to those\n\n26:49.600 --> 26:52.080\n that diverged 150 million years ago\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:54.200\n or it can be a head which no one's ever seen before,\n\n26:54.200 --> 26:56.760\n a different kind of head.\n\n26:56.760 --> 26:59.320\n Now that is really, you might say, a hopeful monster.\n\n26:59.320 --> 27:02.000\n This is a kind of leap into a different direction.\n\n27:02.000 --> 27:05.040\n The only question for natural selection is does it work?\n\n27:05.040 --> 27:08.200\n Is the change itself feasible as a single change?\n\n27:08.200 --> 27:09.880\n And the answer is yes, it's just a small change\n\n27:09.880 --> 27:11.080\n to a single gene.\n\n27:11.080 --> 27:12.900\n And the second thing is it gives rise\n\n27:12.900 --> 27:14.880\n to a completely different morphology.\n\n27:14.880 --> 27:16.000\n Does it work?\n\n27:16.000 --> 27:21.000\n And if it works, that can easily be a shift.\n\n27:21.000 --> 27:25.400\n But for it to be a speciation, for it to continue,\n\n27:25.400 --> 27:29.720\n for it to give rise to a different morphology over time,\n\n27:29.720 --> 27:32.000\n then it has to be perpetuated.\n\n27:32.000 --> 27:37.000\n So that shift, that change in that one gene\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:41.100\n has to work well enough that it is selected and it goes on.\n\n27:41.100 --> 27:44.320\n And copied enough times to where you can really test it.\n\n27:44.320 --> 27:46.040\n So the likelihood, it would be lost,\n\n27:46.040 --> 27:48.780\n but there will be some occasions where it survives.\n\n27:48.780 --> 27:51.920\n And yes, the idea that we can have sudden, fairly abrupt\n\n27:51.920 --> 27:54.940\n changes in evolution, I think it's time for a rebirth.\n\n27:54.940 --> 27:58.640\n What about this idea that kind of trying to\n\n27:58.640 --> 28:03.640\n mathematize a definition of life and saying how many steps,\n\n28:04.500 --> 28:07.100\n the shortest amount of steps it takes to build the thing,\n\n28:07.100 --> 28:09.660\n almost like an engineering view of it?\n\n28:09.660 --> 28:11.880\n Ah, I like that view.\n\n28:11.880 --> 28:14.560\n Because I think that in a sense, that's not very far away\n\n28:14.560 --> 28:17.340\n from what a hypothesis needs to do\n\n28:17.340 --> 28:19.520\n to be a testable hypothesis for the origin of life.\n\n28:19.520 --> 28:22.440\n You need to spell out, here's each step,\n\n28:22.440 --> 28:24.960\n and here's the experiment to do for each step.\n\n28:24.960 --> 28:26.960\n The idea that we can do it in the lab,\n\n28:26.960 --> 28:29.820\n some people say, oh, we'll have created life\n\n28:29.820 --> 28:32.680\n within five years, but ask them what they mean by life.\n\n28:34.560 --> 28:36.680\n We have a planet four billion years ago\n\n28:36.680 --> 28:39.280\n with these vent systems across the entire surface\n\n28:39.280 --> 28:41.880\n of the planet, and we have millions of years if we wanted.\n\n28:41.880 --> 28:43.400\n I have a feeling that we're not talking about\n\n28:43.400 --> 28:44.240\n millions of years.\n\n28:44.240 --> 28:47.880\n I have a feeling we're talking about maybe millions\n\n28:47.880 --> 28:49.520\n of nanoseconds or picoseconds.\n\n28:49.520 --> 28:52.320\n We're talking about chemistry, which is happening quickly.\n\n28:53.880 --> 28:56.780\n But we still need to constrain those steps,\n\n28:56.780 --> 29:00.880\n but we've got a planet doing similar chemistry.\n\n29:00.880 --> 29:02.660\n You asked about a trajectory.\n\n29:02.660 --> 29:05.260\n The trajectory is the planetary trajectory.\n\n29:05.260 --> 29:06.760\n The planet has properties.\n\n29:06.760 --> 29:08.680\n Basically, it's got a lot of iron at the center of it.\n\n29:08.680 --> 29:10.480\n It's got a lot of electrons at the center of it.\n\n29:10.480 --> 29:12.040\n It's more oxidized on the outside,\n\n29:12.040 --> 29:15.200\n partly because of the sun and partly because the heat\n\n29:15.200 --> 29:17.720\n of volcanoes puts out oxidized gases.\n\n29:17.720 --> 29:19.640\n So the planet is a battery.\n\n29:19.640 --> 29:23.400\n It's a giant battery, and we have a flow of electrons\n\n29:23.400 --> 29:26.200\n going from inside to outside in these hydrothermal vents,\n\n29:26.200 --> 29:29.120\n and that's the same topology that a cell has.\n\n29:29.120 --> 29:32.780\n A cell is basically just a micro version of the planet,\n\n29:34.160 --> 29:37.000\n and there is a trajectory in all of that,\n\n29:37.000 --> 29:39.360\n and there's an inevitability that certain types\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:42.360\n of chemical reaction are going to be favored over others,\n\n29:42.360 --> 29:46.240\n and there's an inevitability in what happens in water,\n\n29:46.240 --> 29:47.880\n the chemistry that happens in water.\n\n29:47.880 --> 29:51.840\n Some will be immiscible with water and will form membranes\n\n29:51.840 --> 29:53.320\n and will form insoluble structures,\n\n29:53.320 --> 29:57.300\n and nobody really understands water very well,\n\n29:58.280 --> 30:00.680\n and it's another big question.\n\n30:00.680 --> 30:04.440\n For experiments on the origin of life, what do you put it in?\n\n30:04.440 --> 30:07.200\n What kind of structure do we want to induce in this water?\n\n30:07.200 --> 30:08.840\n Because the last thing it's likely to be\n\n30:08.840 --> 30:11.640\n is just kind of bulk water.\n\n30:11.640 --> 30:14.240\n How fundamental is water to life, would you say?\n\n30:14.240 --> 30:16.420\n I would say pretty fundamental.\n\n30:17.800 --> 30:20.040\n I wouldn't like to say it's impossible for life\n\n30:20.040 --> 30:25.040\n to start any other way, but water is everywhere.\n\n30:26.060 --> 30:27.760\n Water's extremely good at what it does,\n\n30:27.760 --> 30:31.160\n and carbon works in water especially well.\n\n30:31.160 --> 30:33.240\n So those things, and carbon is everywhere.\n\n30:33.240 --> 30:35.660\n So those things together make me think probabilistically,\n\n30:35.660 --> 30:39.160\n if we found a thousand life forms, 995 of them\n\n30:39.160 --> 30:41.920\n would be carbon based and living in water.\n\n30:41.920 --> 30:45.400\n Now the reverse question, if you found a puddle of water\n\n30:45.400 --> 30:50.200\n elsewhere and some carbon, no, just a puddle of water.\n\n30:50.200 --> 30:53.240\n Is a puddle of water a pretty damn good indication\n\n30:53.240 --> 30:58.240\n that life either exists here or has once existed here?\n\n31:00.960 --> 31:02.340\n No.\n\n31:02.340 --> 31:04.040\n So it doesn't work the other way.\n\n31:04.040 --> 31:07.580\n I think you need a living planet.\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:09.100\n You need a planet which is capable\n\n31:09.100 --> 31:10.740\n of turning over its surface.\n\n31:10.740 --> 31:12.860\n It needs to be a planet with water.\n\n31:12.860 --> 31:16.880\n It needs to be capable of bringing those electrons\n\n31:16.880 --> 31:18.140\n from inside to the outside.\n\n31:18.140 --> 31:19.660\n It needs to turn over its surface.\n\n31:19.660 --> 31:22.920\n It needs to make that water work and turn it into hydrogen.\n\n31:22.920 --> 31:24.740\n So I think you need a living planet.\n\n31:24.740 --> 31:25.940\n But once you've got the living planet,\n\n31:25.940 --> 31:29.420\n I think the rest of it is kind of thermodynamics all the way.\n\n31:29.420 --> 31:34.420\n So if you were to run Earth over a million times up\n\n31:34.500 --> 31:37.820\n to this point, maybe beyond, to the end,\n\n31:37.820 --> 31:41.420\n let's run it to the end, what is it?\n\n31:41.420 --> 31:42.980\n How much variety is there?\n\n31:42.980 --> 31:45.060\n You kind of spoke to this trajectory\n\n31:45.060 --> 31:49.900\n that the environment dictates chemically,\n\n31:49.900 --> 31:53.560\n I don't know in which other way, spiritually,\n\n31:53.560 --> 31:57.100\n I don't know, like dictates kind of the direction\n\n31:57.100 --> 32:01.900\n of this giant machine that seems chaotic,\n\n32:01.900 --> 32:06.180\n but it does seem to have order in the steps it's taking.\n\n32:06.180 --> 32:11.180\n How often will life, how often will bacteria emerge?\n\n32:11.420 --> 32:13.420\n How often will something like humans emerge?\n\n32:13.420 --> 32:15.320\n How much variety do you think there would be?\n\n32:15.320 --> 32:19.400\n I think at the level of bacteria, not much variety.\n\n32:19.400 --> 32:22.120\n I think we would get, that's how many times\n\n32:22.120 --> 32:24.620\n you say you want to run it, a million times.\n\n32:24.620 --> 32:28.020\n I would say at least a few hundred thousand will get bacteria again.\n\n32:28.020 --> 32:29.460\n Oh, wow, nice.\n\n32:29.460 --> 32:31.860\n Because I think there's some level of inevitability\n\n32:31.860 --> 32:33.980\n that a wet rocky planet will give rise\n\n32:33.980 --> 32:38.260\n through the same processes to something very close.\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:40.460\n I think this is not something I'd have thought\n\n32:40.460 --> 32:43.380\n a few years ago, but working with a PhD student\n\n32:43.380 --> 32:45.060\n of mine, Stuart Harrison, he's been thinking\n\n32:45.060 --> 32:47.580\n about the genetic code, and we've just been publishing\n\n32:47.580 --> 32:51.580\n on that, there are patterns that you can discern in the code,\n\n32:51.580 --> 32:53.440\n or he has discerned in the code,\n\n32:53.440 --> 32:56.100\n that if you think about them in terms of,\n\n32:56.100 --> 32:57.780\n we start with CO2 and hydrogen,\n\n32:57.780 --> 32:59.780\n and these are the first steps of biochemistry,\n\n32:59.780 --> 33:01.660\n you come up with a code which is very similar\n\n33:01.660 --> 33:03.660\n to the code that we see.\n\n33:03.660 --> 33:05.580\n So it wouldn't surprise me any longer\n\n33:05.580 --> 33:07.800\n if we found life on Mars and it had a genetic code\n\n33:07.800 --> 33:09.780\n that was not very different to the genetic code\n\n33:09.780 --> 33:13.340\n that we have here, without it just being transferred across.\n\n33:13.340 --> 33:16.180\n There's some inevitability about the whole\n\n33:16.180 --> 33:18.580\n of the beginnings of life, in my view.\n\n33:18.580 --> 33:21.540\n That's really promising, because if the basic chemistry\n\n33:21.540 --> 33:25.940\n is tightly linked to the genetic code,\n\n33:25.940 --> 33:29.540\n that means we can interact with other life\n\n33:29.540 --> 33:30.500\n if it exists out there.\n\n33:30.500 --> 33:32.140\n Well, that's potentially.\n\n33:32.140 --> 33:34.620\n That's really exciting, if that's the case.\n\n33:34.620 --> 33:36.060\n Okay, but then bacteria.\n\n33:36.060 --> 33:37.800\n We've got bacteria.\n\n33:37.800 --> 33:39.180\n Yeah.\n\n33:39.180 --> 33:41.200\n How easy is photosynthesis?\n\n33:42.920 --> 33:44.880\n Much harder, I would say.\n\n33:44.880 --> 33:46.060\n Let's actually go there.\n\n33:46.060 --> 33:47.620\n Let's go through the inventions.\n\n33:47.620 --> 33:49.160\n Yeah.\n\n33:49.160 --> 33:51.240\n What is photosynthesis?\n\n33:51.240 --> 33:52.420\n And why is it hard?\n\n33:52.420 --> 33:55.340\n Well, there are different forms.\n\n33:55.340 --> 33:57.500\n I mean, basically, you're taking hydrogen\n\n33:57.500 --> 33:59.000\n and you're sticking it onto CO2,\n\n33:59.000 --> 34:00.340\n and it's powered by the sun.\n\n34:00.340 --> 34:02.860\n Question is, where are you taking the hydrogen from?\n\n34:02.860 --> 34:05.340\n And in photosynthesis that we know in plants,\n\n34:05.340 --> 34:06.760\n it's coming from water.\n\n34:06.760 --> 34:08.840\n So you're using the power of the sun to split water,\n\n34:08.840 --> 34:11.480\n take out the hydrogen, stick it onto CO2,\n\n34:11.480 --> 34:13.100\n and the oxygen is a waste product,\n\n34:13.100 --> 34:15.660\n and you just throw it out, throw it away.\n\n34:15.660 --> 34:19.100\n So it's the single greatest planetary pollution event\n\n34:19.100 --> 34:21.340\n in the whole history of the Earth.\n\n34:21.340 --> 34:22.460\n The pollutant being oxygen.\n\n34:22.460 --> 34:24.000\n Yes, yeah.\n\n34:24.000 --> 34:26.200\n It also made possible animals.\n\n34:26.200 --> 34:28.460\n You can't have large, active animals\n\n34:28.460 --> 34:30.020\n without an oxygenated atmosphere,\n\n34:30.020 --> 34:33.700\n at least not in the sense that we know on Earth.\n\n34:33.700 --> 34:35.540\n So that's a really big invention\n\n34:35.540 --> 34:37.540\n in the history of Earth. Huge invention, yes.\n\n34:37.540 --> 34:38.460\n And it happened once.\n\n34:38.460 --> 34:40.380\n There's a few things that happen once on Earth,\n\n34:40.380 --> 34:42.680\n and you're always stuck with this problem.\n\n34:42.680 --> 34:44.780\n Once it happened, did it become so good so quickly\n\n34:44.780 --> 34:48.300\n that it precluded the same thing happening ever again?\n\n34:48.300 --> 34:49.500\n Or are there other reasons?\n\n34:49.500 --> 34:51.220\n And we really have to look at each one in turn\n\n34:51.220 --> 34:53.980\n and think, why did it only happen once?\n\n34:53.980 --> 34:57.980\n In this case, it's really difficult to split water.\n\n34:57.980 --> 34:59.140\n It requires a lot of power,\n\n34:59.140 --> 35:01.800\n and that power, you're effectively separating charge\n\n35:01.800 --> 35:04.040\n across a membrane, and the way in which you do it,\n\n35:04.040 --> 35:05.340\n if it doesn't all rush back\n\n35:05.340 --> 35:08.260\n and kind of cause an explosion right at the site,\n\n35:08.260 --> 35:10.700\n requires really careful wiring.\n\n35:10.700 --> 35:14.740\n And that wiring, it can't be easy to get it right\n\n35:14.740 --> 35:18.700\n because the plants that we see around us,\n\n35:18.700 --> 35:19.540\n they have chloroplasts.\n\n35:19.540 --> 35:21.340\n Those chloroplasts were cyanobacteria ones.\n\n35:21.340 --> 35:23.620\n Those cyanobacteria are the only group of bacteria\n\n35:23.620 --> 35:25.740\n that can do that type of photosynthesis.\n\n35:25.740 --> 35:28.220\n So there's plenty of opportunity.\n\n35:28.220 --> 35:29.520\n So not even many bacteria.\n\n35:29.520 --> 35:32.180\n So who invented photosynthesis?\n\n35:32.180 --> 35:34.180\n The cyanobacteria, or their ancestors.\n\n35:34.180 --> 35:36.020\n And there's not many?\n\n35:36.020 --> 35:37.740\n No other bacteria can do\n\n35:37.740 --> 35:39.740\n what's called oxygenic photosynthesis.\n\n35:39.740 --> 35:42.100\n Lots of other bacteria can split.\n\n35:42.100 --> 35:44.080\n I mean, you can take your hydrogen from somewhere else.\n\n35:44.080 --> 35:45.500\n You can take it from hydrogen sulfide\n\n35:45.500 --> 35:47.220\n bubbling out of a hydrothermal vent.\n\n35:47.220 --> 35:49.460\n Grab your two hydrogens.\n\n35:49.460 --> 35:51.060\n The sulfur is the waste now.\n\n35:52.100 --> 35:53.300\n You can do it from iron.\n\n35:53.300 --> 35:54.220\n You can take electrons.\n\n35:54.220 --> 35:56.060\n So the early oceans were probably full of iron.\n\n35:56.060 --> 35:59.020\n You can take an electron from ferrous iron,\n\n35:59.020 --> 36:01.620\n so iron two plus and make it iron three plus,\n\n36:01.620 --> 36:03.960\n which now precipitates as rust,\n\n36:03.960 --> 36:07.620\n and you take a proton from the acidic early ocean,\n\n36:07.620 --> 36:08.440\n stick it there.\n\n36:08.440 --> 36:09.300\n Now you've got a hydrogen atom.\n\n36:09.300 --> 36:10.720\n Stick it onto CO2.\n\n36:10.720 --> 36:12.380\n You've just done the trick.\n\n36:12.380 --> 36:16.460\n The trouble is you bury yourself in rusty iron.\n\n36:16.460 --> 36:18.540\n And with sulfur, you can bury yourself in sulfur.\n\n36:18.540 --> 36:20.700\n One of the reasons oxygenic photosynthesis\n\n36:20.700 --> 36:23.340\n is so much better is that the waste product is oxygen,\n\n36:23.340 --> 36:24.540\n which just bubbles away.\n\n36:26.420 --> 36:29.220\n That seems like extremely unlikely,\n\n36:29.220 --> 36:30.740\n and it's extremely essential\n\n36:30.740 --> 36:32.700\n for the evolution of complex organisms\n\n36:33.720 --> 36:35.160\n because of all the oxygen.\n\n36:36.120 --> 36:39.420\n Yeah, and that didn't accumulate quickly either.\n\n36:39.420 --> 36:42.060\n So it's converting, what is it?\n\n36:42.060 --> 36:43.900\n It's converting energy from the sun\n\n36:44.820 --> 36:46.960\n and the resource of water\n\n36:46.960 --> 36:49.940\n into the resource needed for animals.\n\n36:50.820 --> 36:52.400\n Both resources needed for animals.\n\n36:52.400 --> 36:54.540\n We need to eat, and we need to burn the food,\n\n36:54.540 --> 36:57.780\n and we're eating plants,\n\n36:57.780 --> 36:59.300\n which are getting their energy from the sun,\n\n36:59.300 --> 37:01.260\n and we're burning it with their waste product,\n\n37:01.260 --> 37:02.540\n which is the oxygen.\n\n37:02.540 --> 37:04.620\n So there's a lot of kind of circularity in that,\n\n37:04.620 --> 37:07.880\n but without an oxygenated planet,\n\n37:07.880 --> 37:12.560\n you couldn't really have predation.\n\n37:12.560 --> 37:14.980\n You can have animals,\n\n37:14.980 --> 37:16.240\n but you can't really have animals\n\n37:16.240 --> 37:17.440\n that go around and eat each other.\n\n37:17.440 --> 37:19.900\n You can't have ecosystems as we know them.\n\n37:19.900 --> 37:21.120\n Well, let's actually step back.\n\n37:21.120 --> 37:25.620\n What about eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cells, prokaryotes?\n\n37:25.620 --> 37:28.420\n What are each of those,\n\n37:28.420 --> 37:31.060\n and how big of an invention is that?\n\n37:31.060 --> 37:33.380\n I personally think that's the single biggest invention\n\n37:33.380 --> 37:34.820\n in the whole history of life.\n\n37:34.820 --> 37:35.900\n Exciting.\n\n37:35.900 --> 37:36.900\n So what are they?\n\n37:36.900 --> 37:37.740\n Can you explain?\n\n37:37.740 --> 37:40.780\n Yeah, so I mentioned bacteria and archaea.\n\n37:40.780 --> 37:43.020\n These are both prokaryotes.\n\n37:43.020 --> 37:45.740\n They're basically small cells that don't have a nucleus.\n\n37:45.740 --> 37:47.060\n If you look at them under a microscope,\n\n37:47.060 --> 37:48.140\n you don't see much going on.\n\n37:48.140 --> 37:50.640\n If you look at them under a super resolution microscope,\n\n37:50.640 --> 37:53.220\n then they're fantastically complex.\n\n37:53.220 --> 37:55.460\n In terms of their molecular machinery, they're amazing.\n\n37:55.460 --> 37:58.360\n In terms of their morphological appearance\n\n37:58.360 --> 38:03.060\n under a microscope, they're really small and really simple.\n\n38:03.060 --> 38:04.900\n The earliest life that we can physically see\n\n38:04.900 --> 38:06.380\n on the planet are stromatolites,\n\n38:06.380 --> 38:08.500\n which are made by things like cyanobacteria,\n\n38:08.500 --> 38:11.020\n and they're large superstructures.\n\n38:11.020 --> 38:14.420\n Effectively, biofilms plated on top of each other,\n\n38:14.420 --> 38:17.360\n and you end up with quite large structures\n\n38:17.360 --> 38:19.780\n that you can see in the fossil record.\n\n38:19.780 --> 38:23.100\n But they never came up with animals.\n\n38:23.100 --> 38:24.320\n They never came up with plants.\n\n38:24.320 --> 38:26.660\n They came up with multicellular things,\n\n38:26.660 --> 38:28.620\n filamentous cyanobacteria, for example.\n\n38:28.620 --> 38:31.420\n They're just long strings of cells.\n\n38:31.420 --> 38:34.500\n But the origin of the eukaryotic cell\n\n38:34.500 --> 38:37.300\n seems to have been what's called an endosymbiosis,\n\n38:37.300 --> 38:39.620\n so one cell gets inside another cell.\n\n38:39.620 --> 38:42.160\n And I think that that's transformed\n\n38:42.160 --> 38:43.780\n the energetic possibilities of life.\n\n38:43.780 --> 38:48.160\n So what we end up with is a kind of supercharged cell,\n\n38:48.160 --> 38:50.460\n which can have a much larger nucleus\n\n38:50.460 --> 38:54.180\n with many more genes, all supported.\n\n38:54.180 --> 38:55.780\n If you think about it, you could think about it\n\n38:55.780 --> 38:58.340\n as multi bacterial power without the overhead.\n\n38:58.340 --> 39:00.860\n So you've got a cell and it's got bacteria living in it,\n\n39:00.860 --> 39:02.260\n and those bacteria are providing it\n\n39:02.260 --> 39:04.700\n with the energy currency it needs.\n\n39:04.700 --> 39:07.060\n But each bacterium has a genome of its own,\n\n39:07.060 --> 39:10.340\n which costs a fair amount of energy to express,\n\n39:10.340 --> 39:13.920\n to kind of turn over and convert into proteins and so on.\n\n39:15.060 --> 39:16.780\n What the mitochondria did,\n\n39:16.780 --> 39:20.500\n which are these power packs in our own cells,\n\n39:20.500 --> 39:22.340\n they were bacteria once,\n\n39:22.340 --> 39:24.100\n and they threw away virtually all their genes.\n\n39:24.100 --> 39:25.660\n They've only got a few left.\n\n39:25.660 --> 39:27.720\n So mitochondria is, like you said,\n\n39:27.720 --> 39:30.120\n is the bacteria that got inside a cell\n\n39:30.120 --> 39:32.300\n and then throw away all this stuff it doesn't need to,\n\n39:32.300 --> 39:35.260\n survive inside the cell, and then kept what?\n\n39:35.260 --> 39:36.340\n So what we end up with,\n\n39:36.340 --> 39:38.820\n so it kept always a handful of genes.\n\n39:38.820 --> 39:41.580\n In our own case, 37 genes.\n\n39:41.580 --> 39:44.620\n But there's a few protists, which are single celled things\n\n39:44.620 --> 39:47.220\n that have got as many as 70 or 80 genes.\n\n39:47.220 --> 39:50.220\n So it's not always the same, but it's always a small number.\n\n39:51.220 --> 39:54.180\n And you can think of it as a paired down power pack\n\n39:54.180 --> 39:56.020\n where the control unit has really been,\n\n39:56.020 --> 39:58.800\n has been kind of paired down to almost nothing.\n\n39:58.800 --> 40:00.860\n So you're putting out the same power,\n\n40:00.860 --> 40:04.380\n but the investment in the overheads is really paired down.\n\n40:04.380 --> 40:05.740\n That means that you can support\n\n40:05.740 --> 40:08.420\n a much larger nuclear genome.\n\n40:08.420 --> 40:10.540\n So we've gone up in the number of genes,\n\n40:10.540 --> 40:12.220\n but also the amount of power you have\n\n40:12.220 --> 40:14.080\n to convert those genes into proteins.\n\n40:14.940 --> 40:17.100\n We've gone up about fourfold in the number of genes,\n\n40:17.100 --> 40:19.260\n but in terms of the size of genomes\n\n40:19.260 --> 40:21.840\n and your ability to make the building blocks,\n\n40:21.840 --> 40:25.100\n make the proteins, we've gone up 100,000 fold or more.\n\n40:25.100 --> 40:29.540\n So it's huge step change in the possibilities of evolution.\n\n40:29.540 --> 40:33.980\n And it's interesting then that the only two occasions\n\n40:33.980 --> 40:35.900\n that complex life has arisen on Earth,\n\n40:35.900 --> 40:37.180\n plants and animals,\n\n40:38.060 --> 40:40.140\n fungi you could say are complex as well,\n\n40:40.140 --> 40:42.820\n but they don't form such complex morphology\n\n40:42.820 --> 40:44.540\n as plants and animals.\n\n40:44.540 --> 40:45.660\n Start with a single cell.\n\n40:45.660 --> 40:48.380\n They start with an oocyte and a sperm\n\n40:48.380 --> 40:50.420\n fused together to make a zygote.\n\n40:50.420 --> 40:52.300\n So we start development with a single cell\n\n40:52.300 --> 40:56.460\n and all the cells in the organism have identical DNA.\n\n40:56.460 --> 40:58.340\n And you switch off in the brain,\n\n40:58.340 --> 41:00.540\n you switch off these genes and you switch on those genes\n\n41:00.540 --> 41:01.700\n and liver, you switch off those\n\n41:01.700 --> 41:04.060\n and you switch on a different set.\n\n41:04.060 --> 41:06.120\n And the standard evolutionary explanation for that\n\n41:06.120 --> 41:08.580\n is that you're restricting conflict.\n\n41:08.580 --> 41:10.980\n You don't have a load of genetically different cells\n\n41:10.980 --> 41:13.340\n that are all fighting each other.\n\n41:13.340 --> 41:14.700\n And so it works.\n\n41:14.700 --> 41:17.180\n The trouble with bacteria, they form these biofilms\n\n41:17.180 --> 41:18.520\n and they're all genetically different.\n\n41:18.520 --> 41:21.020\n And effectively they're incapable\n\n41:21.020 --> 41:23.300\n of that level of cooperation.\n\n41:23.300 --> 41:24.600\n They would get in a fight.\n\n41:26.380 --> 41:30.060\n Okay, so why is this such a difficult invention\n\n41:31.180 --> 41:33.380\n of getting this bacteria inside\n\n41:33.380 --> 41:37.300\n and becoming an engine which the mitochondria is?\n\n41:37.300 --> 41:40.420\n Why do you assign it such great importance?\n\n41:40.420 --> 41:42.180\n Is it great importance in terms of the difficulty\n\n41:42.180 --> 41:44.300\n of how it was to achieve or great importance\n\n41:44.300 --> 41:46.900\n in terms of the impact it had on life?\n\n41:46.900 --> 41:48.380\n Both.\n\n41:48.380 --> 41:49.780\n It had a huge impact on life\n\n41:49.780 --> 41:52.500\n because if that had not happened,\n\n41:52.500 --> 41:54.940\n you can be certain that life on earth\n\n41:54.940 --> 41:56.500\n would be bacterial only.\n\n41:56.500 --> 41:58.180\n And that took a really long time too.\n\n41:58.180 --> 41:59.940\n It took 2 billion years.\n\n41:59.940 --> 42:02.740\n And it hasn't happened since to the best of our knowledge.\n\n42:02.740 --> 42:05.100\n So it looks as if it's genuinely difficult.\n\n42:05.100 --> 42:06.200\n And if you think about it then\n\n42:06.200 --> 42:08.500\n from just an informational perspective,\n\n42:08.500 --> 42:12.380\n you think bacteria have got,\n\n42:12.380 --> 42:15.260\n they structure their information differently.\n\n42:15.260 --> 42:17.540\n So a bacterial cell has a small genome,\n\n42:17.540 --> 42:19.060\n you might have 4,000 genes in it,\n\n42:19.060 --> 42:21.100\n but a single E. coli cell has access\n\n42:21.100 --> 42:24.060\n to about 30,000 genes potentially.\n\n42:24.060 --> 42:26.020\n It's got a kind of metagenome\n\n42:26.020 --> 42:27.860\n where other E. coli out there\n\n42:27.860 --> 42:29.060\n have got different gene sets\n\n42:29.060 --> 42:31.820\n and they can switch them around between themselves.\n\n42:31.820 --> 42:34.580\n And so you can generate a huge amount of variation\n\n42:34.580 --> 42:36.220\n and they've got more,\n\n42:36.220 --> 42:40.620\n an E. coli metagenome is larger than the human genome.\n\n42:40.620 --> 42:43.220\n We own 20,000 genes or something.\n\n42:43.220 --> 42:46.900\n So, and they've had 4 billion years of evolution\n\n42:46.900 --> 42:48.540\n to work out what can I do\n\n42:48.540 --> 42:51.540\n and what can't I do with this metagenome?\n\n42:51.540 --> 42:54.300\n And the answer is you're stuck, you're still bacteria.\n\n42:54.300 --> 42:58.940\n So they have explored genetic sequence space\n\n42:58.940 --> 43:01.260\n far more thoroughly than eukaryotes ever did\n\n43:01.260 --> 43:03.060\n because they've had twice as long at least\n\n43:03.060 --> 43:05.940\n and they've got much larger populations\n\n43:05.940 --> 43:08.420\n and they never got around this problem.\n\n43:08.420 --> 43:09.340\n So why can't they?\n\n43:09.340 --> 43:12.420\n It seems as if you can't solve it with information alone.\n\n43:12.420 --> 43:14.860\n So what's the problem?\n\n43:14.860 --> 43:16.400\n The problem is structure.\n\n43:16.400 --> 43:21.020\n If the very first cells needed an electrical charge\n\n43:21.020 --> 43:23.820\n on their membrane to grow and in bacteria,\n\n43:23.820 --> 43:26.220\n it's the outer membrane that surrounds the cell\n\n43:26.220 --> 43:28.220\n which is electrically charged.\n\n43:28.220 --> 43:29.740\n You try and scale that up\n\n43:29.740 --> 43:31.940\n and you've got a fundamental design problem,\n\n43:31.940 --> 43:33.680\n you've got an engineering problem.\n\n43:33.680 --> 43:35.260\n And there are examples of it\n\n43:35.260 --> 43:37.080\n and what we see in all these cases\n\n43:37.080 --> 43:38.780\n is what's known as extreme polyploidy,\n\n43:38.780 --> 43:41.020\n which is to say they have tens of thousands of copies\n\n43:41.020 --> 43:42.740\n of their complete genome,\n\n43:42.740 --> 43:45.520\n which is energetically hugely expensive\n\n43:45.520 --> 43:49.020\n and you end up with a large bacteria\n\n43:49.020 --> 43:52.340\n with no further development.\n\n43:52.340 --> 43:55.020\n What you need is to incorporate\n\n43:55.020 --> 43:58.500\n these electrically charged power pack units inside\n\n43:58.500 --> 44:01.380\n with their control units intact\n\n44:01.380 --> 44:03.980\n and for them not to conflict so much with the host cell\n\n44:03.980 --> 44:05.900\n that it all goes wrong.\n\n44:05.900 --> 44:07.860\n Perhaps it goes wrong more often than not.\n\n44:07.860 --> 44:10.940\n And then you change the topology of the cell.\n\n44:10.940 --> 44:14.220\n Now you don't necessarily have any more DNA\n\n44:14.220 --> 44:16.740\n than a giant bacterium with extreme polyploidy,\n\n44:16.740 --> 44:19.340\n but what you've got is an asymmetry.\n\n44:19.340 --> 44:21.940\n You now have a giant nuclear genome\n\n44:21.940 --> 44:25.640\n which surrounded by lots of subsidiary energetic genomes\n\n44:25.640 --> 44:27.920\n that do all the, they're the control units\n\n44:27.920 --> 44:32.340\n that are doing all the control of energy generation.\n\n44:32.340 --> 44:33.980\n Could this have been done gradually\n\n44:33.980 --> 44:35.900\n or does it have to be done,\n\n44:35.900 --> 44:38.180\n the power pack has to be all intact\n\n44:38.180 --> 44:40.180\n and ready to go and working?\n\n44:40.180 --> 44:41.860\n I mean, it's a kind of step change\n\n44:41.860 --> 44:43.420\n in the possibilities of evolution,\n\n44:43.420 --> 44:44.540\n but it doesn't happen overnight.\n\n44:44.540 --> 44:47.700\n It's gonna still require multiple, multiple generations.\n\n44:47.700 --> 44:50.900\n So it could take millions of years.\n\n44:50.900 --> 44:52.220\n It could take shorter times.\n\n44:52.220 --> 44:54.100\n There's another thing I would like to put the number of steps\n\n44:54.100 --> 44:56.180\n and try and work out what's required at each step.\n\n44:56.180 --> 44:58.500\n And we are trying to do that with sex for example.\n\n44:58.500 --> 45:00.820\n You can't have a very large genome\n\n45:00.820 --> 45:02.220\n unless you have sex at that point.\n\n45:02.220 --> 45:03.340\n So what are the changes to go\n\n45:03.340 --> 45:07.060\n from bacterial recombination to eukaryotic recombination?\n\n45:07.860 --> 45:09.540\n What do you need to do?\n\n45:09.540 --> 45:12.340\n Why do we go from passing around bits of DNA\n\n45:12.340 --> 45:15.340\n as if it's loose change to fusing cells together,\n\n45:15.340 --> 45:16.580\n lining up the chromosomes,\n\n45:16.580 --> 45:18.620\n recombining across the chromosomes,\n\n45:18.620 --> 45:20.820\n and then going through two rounds of cell division\n\n45:20.820 --> 45:22.340\n to produce your gametes?\n\n45:22.340 --> 45:24.440\n All eukaryotes do it that way.\n\n45:24.440 --> 45:27.420\n So again, why switch?\n\n45:27.420 --> 45:28.780\n What are the drivers here?\n\n45:28.780 --> 45:31.420\n So there's a lot of time, there's a lot of evolution,\n\n45:31.420 --> 45:34.100\n but as soon as you've got cells living inside another cell,\n\n45:34.100 --> 45:36.340\n what you've got is a new design.\n\n45:36.340 --> 45:39.100\n You've got new potential that you didn't have before.\n\n45:39.100 --> 45:43.300\n So the cell living inside another cell, that design\n\n45:44.220 --> 45:48.700\n allows for better storage of information,\n\n45:48.700 --> 45:52.780\n better use of energy, more delegation,\n\n45:52.780 --> 45:55.420\n like a hierarchical control of the whole thing.\n\n45:55.420 --> 45:58.340\n And then somehow that leads to ability\n\n45:58.340 --> 46:00.180\n to have multi cell organisms.\n\n46:00.180 --> 46:03.300\n I'm not sure that you have hierarchical control necessarily,\n\n46:03.300 --> 46:06.460\n but you've got a system where you can have\n\n46:06.460 --> 46:09.940\n a much larger information storage depot in the nucleus.\n\n46:09.940 --> 46:11.700\n You can have a much larger genome.\n\n46:11.700 --> 46:13.620\n And that allows multicellularity, yes,\n\n46:13.620 --> 46:18.500\n because it allows you, it's a funny thing,\n\n46:18.500 --> 46:23.500\n to have an animal where I have 70% of my genes\n\n46:24.140 --> 46:25.260\n switched on in my brain,\n\n46:25.260 --> 46:28.500\n and a different 50% switched on in my liver or something,\n\n46:28.500 --> 46:30.860\n you've got to have all those genes in the egg cell\n\n46:30.860 --> 46:31.780\n at the very beginning,\n\n46:31.780 --> 46:35.500\n and you've got to have a program of development\n\n46:35.500 --> 46:37.900\n which says, okay, you guys switch off those genes\n\n46:37.900 --> 46:40.300\n and switch on those genes, and you guys, you do that.\n\n46:40.300 --> 46:42.180\n But all the genes are there at the beginning.\n\n46:42.180 --> 46:44.100\n That means you've got to have a lot of genes in one cell\n\n46:44.100 --> 46:45.620\n and you've got to be able to maintain them.\n\n46:45.620 --> 46:47.660\n And the problem with bacteria is they don't get close\n\n46:47.660 --> 46:49.900\n to having enough genes in one cell.\n\n46:49.900 --> 46:52.760\n So if you were to try and make a multicellular organism\n\n46:52.760 --> 46:54.500\n from bacteria, you'd bring different types\n\n46:54.500 --> 46:56.540\n of bacteria together and hope they'll cooperate.\n\n46:56.540 --> 46:57.940\n And the reality is they don't.\n\n46:57.940 --> 46:59.540\n That's really, really tough to do.\n\n46:59.540 --> 47:00.380\n Yeah.\n\n47:00.380 --> 47:02.700\n We know they don't because it doesn't exist.\n\n47:02.700 --> 47:04.580\n We have the data as far as we know.\n\n47:04.580 --> 47:06.420\n I'm sure there's a few special ones\n\n47:06.420 --> 47:08.180\n and they dead off quickly.\n\n47:08.180 --> 47:09.980\n I'd love to know some of the most fun things\n\n47:09.980 --> 47:11.760\n bacteria have done since.\n\n47:12.660 --> 47:13.500\n Oh, there's a few.\n\n47:13.500 --> 47:15.460\n I mean, they can do some pretty funky things.\n\n47:15.460 --> 47:18.260\n And this is broad brushstroke that I'm talking about.\n\n47:18.260 --> 47:19.200\n Yes.\n\n47:19.200 --> 47:20.220\n Generally speaking.\n\n47:21.060 --> 47:25.060\n So how was, so another fun invention.\n\n47:25.060 --> 47:27.820\n Us humans seem to utilize it well,\n\n47:27.820 --> 47:31.540\n but you say it's also very important early on is sex.\n\n47:31.540 --> 47:34.540\n So what is sex?\n\n47:34.540 --> 47:36.380\n Just asking for a friend.\n\n47:36.380 --> 47:39.300\n And when was it invented and how hard was it to invent,\n\n47:39.300 --> 47:42.340\n just as you were saying, and why was it invented?\n\n47:42.340 --> 47:45.660\n Why, how hard was it and when?\n\n47:45.660 --> 47:47.980\n I have a PhD student who's been working on this\n\n47:47.980 --> 47:49.980\n and we've just published a couple of papers on sex.\n\n47:49.980 --> 47:50.900\n Yes, yes, yes.\n\n47:50.900 --> 47:51.740\n What do you publish?\n\n47:51.740 --> 47:55.540\n Does biology, is it biology, genetics, journals?\n\n47:55.540 --> 47:57.220\n This is actually PNAS,\n\n47:57.220 --> 48:00.180\n which is Proceedings of the National Academy.\n\n48:00.180 --> 48:02.420\n Broad, big, big picture stuff.\n\n48:02.420 --> 48:03.500\n Everyone's interested in sex.\n\n48:03.500 --> 48:04.340\n Yeah.\n\n48:04.340 --> 48:07.940\n And the job of a biologist is to make sex dull.\n\n48:07.940 --> 48:10.700\n Yes, yeah, that's a beautiful way to put it.\n\n48:10.700 --> 48:13.220\n Okay, so when was it invented?\n\n48:13.220 --> 48:16.940\n It was invented with eukaryotes about two billion years ago.\n\n48:16.940 --> 48:20.900\n All eukaryotes share the same basic mechanism\n\n48:20.900 --> 48:23.420\n that you produce gametes, the gametes fuse together.\n\n48:23.420 --> 48:26.300\n So a gamete is the egg cell and the sperm.\n\n48:26.300 --> 48:29.580\n They're not necessarily even different in size or shape.\n\n48:29.580 --> 48:31.860\n So the simplest eukaryotes produce\n\n48:31.860 --> 48:32.980\n what are called motile gametes.\n\n48:32.980 --> 48:34.900\n They're all like sperm and they all swim around.\n\n48:34.900 --> 48:36.420\n They find each other, they fuse together.\n\n48:36.420 --> 48:39.940\n They don't have kind of much going on there beyond that.\n\n48:39.940 --> 48:43.180\n And then these are haploid,\n\n48:43.180 --> 48:46.100\n which is to say we all have two copies of our genome\n\n48:46.100 --> 48:49.220\n and the gametes have only a single copy of the genome.\n\n48:49.220 --> 48:51.980\n So when they fuse together, you now become diploid again,\n\n48:51.980 --> 48:55.100\n which is to say you now have two copies of your genome.\n\n48:55.100 --> 48:57.820\n And what you do is you line them all up\n\n48:57.820 --> 49:01.620\n and then you double everything.\n\n49:01.620 --> 49:03.900\n So now we have four copies of the complete genome.\n\n49:03.900 --> 49:05.980\n And then we crisscross between all of these things.\n\n49:05.980 --> 49:07.660\n So we take a bit from here and stick it on there\n\n49:07.660 --> 49:09.620\n and a bit from here and we stick it on here.\n\n49:09.620 --> 49:10.820\n That's recombination.\n\n49:11.740 --> 49:14.820\n And then we go through two rounds of cell division.\n\n49:14.820 --> 49:15.900\n So we divide in half.\n\n49:15.900 --> 49:18.020\n So now the two daughter cells have two copies\n\n49:18.020 --> 49:19.460\n and we divide in half again.\n\n49:19.460 --> 49:21.220\n Now we have some gametes,\n\n49:21.220 --> 49:24.460\n each of which has got a single copy of the genome.\n\n49:24.460 --> 49:26.660\n And that's the basic ground plan\n\n49:26.660 --> 49:29.780\n for what's called meiosis and Syngami.\n\n49:29.780 --> 49:31.340\n That's basically sex.\n\n49:31.340 --> 49:33.900\n And it happens at the level of single celled organisms.\n\n49:33.900 --> 49:35.780\n And it happens pretty much the same way in plants\n\n49:35.780 --> 49:38.140\n and pretty much the same way in animals and so on.\n\n49:38.140 --> 49:40.220\n And it's not found in any bacteria.\n\n49:40.220 --> 49:43.100\n They switch things around using the same machinery\n\n49:43.100 --> 49:44.900\n and they take up a bit of DNA from the environment.\n\n49:44.900 --> 49:46.620\n They take out this bit and stick in that bit\n\n49:46.620 --> 49:50.020\n and it's the same molecular machinery they're using to do it.\n\n49:50.020 --> 49:52.660\n So what about the kind of, you said, find each other,\n\n49:52.660 --> 49:56.020\n this kind of imperative, find each other.\n\n49:56.020 --> 49:57.300\n What is that?\n\n49:57.300 --> 49:58.260\n Like, is that?\n\n49:58.260 --> 50:00.660\n Well, you've got a few cells together.\n\n50:00.660 --> 50:04.420\n So the bottom line on all of this is bacteria.\n\n50:04.420 --> 50:07.820\n I mean, it's kind of simple when you've figured it out\n\n50:07.820 --> 50:09.300\n and figuring it out, this is not me,\n\n50:09.300 --> 50:11.700\n this is my PhD student, Marco Colnaghi.\n\n50:13.020 --> 50:16.420\n And in effect, if you're doing lateral,\n\n50:16.420 --> 50:19.740\n you're a Nicoli cell, you've got 4,000 genes.\n\n50:19.740 --> 50:22.900\n You wanna scale up to a eukaryotic size.\n\n50:22.900 --> 50:25.380\n I wanna have 20,000 genes.\n\n50:25.380 --> 50:27.740\n And I need to maintain my genome\n\n50:27.740 --> 50:30.460\n so it doesn't get shot to pieces by mutations.\n\n50:30.460 --> 50:32.700\n And I'm gonna do it by lateral gene transfer.\n\n50:32.700 --> 50:35.420\n So I know I've got a mutation in a gene.\n\n50:35.420 --> 50:38.820\n I don't know which gene it is because I'm not sentient,\n\n50:38.820 --> 50:40.220\n but I know I can't grow.\n\n50:40.220 --> 50:42.460\n I know all my regulation systems are saying,\n\n50:42.460 --> 50:44.980\n something wrong here, something wrong, pick up some DNA,\n\n50:44.980 --> 50:47.700\n pick up a bit of DNA from the environment.\n\n50:47.700 --> 50:49.060\n If you've got a small genome,\n\n50:49.060 --> 50:50.980\n the chances of you picking up the right bit of DNA\n\n50:50.980 --> 50:52.340\n from the environment is much higher\n\n50:52.340 --> 50:54.780\n than if you've got a genome of 20,000 genes.\n\n50:54.780 --> 50:58.060\n To do that, you've effectively got to be picking up DNA\n\n50:58.060 --> 51:00.500\n all the time, all day long and nothing else.\n\n51:00.500 --> 51:02.220\n And you're still gonna get the wrong DNA.\n\n51:02.220 --> 51:03.720\n You've got to pick up large chunks.\n\n51:03.720 --> 51:05.100\n And in the end, you've got to align them.\n\n51:05.100 --> 51:08.920\n You're forced into sex, to coin a phrase.\n\n51:10.220 --> 51:11.060\n So you're...\n\n51:11.060 --> 51:12.540\n You're forced.\n\n51:12.540 --> 51:17.540\n So there is a kind of incentive.\n\n51:18.660 --> 51:20.100\n If you wanna have a large genome,\n\n51:20.100 --> 51:22.620\n you've got to prevent it mutating to nothing.\n\n51:22.620 --> 51:23.940\n That will happen with bacteria.\n\n51:23.940 --> 51:25.640\n This is another reason why bacteria\n\n51:25.640 --> 51:26.940\n can't have a large genome.\n\n51:26.940 --> 51:28.660\n But as soon as you give them the power pack,\n\n51:28.660 --> 51:30.340\n as soon as you give eukaryotic cells the power pack\n\n51:30.340 --> 51:33.020\n that allows them to increase the size of their genome,\n\n51:33.020 --> 51:34.380\n then you face the pressure\n\n51:34.380 --> 51:36.300\n that you've got to maintain its quality.\n\n51:36.300 --> 51:38.340\n You've got to stop it just mutating away.\n\n51:38.340 --> 51:39.820\n What about sexual selection?\n\n51:39.820 --> 51:44.740\n So the finding, like, I don't like this one.\n\n51:44.740 --> 51:45.740\n I don't like this one.\n\n51:45.740 --> 51:47.220\n This one seems all right.\n\n51:47.220 --> 51:48.420\n Like, what's the...\n\n51:49.820 --> 51:50.660\n Is it...\n\n51:50.660 --> 51:52.740\n At which point does it become less random?\n\n51:52.740 --> 51:54.140\n It's hard to know.\n\n51:54.140 --> 51:56.020\n Because eukaryotes just kind of float around.\n\n51:56.020 --> 51:57.020\n Just kind of have...\n\n51:57.020 --> 51:59.060\n Yeah, I mean, is there sexual selection\n\n51:59.060 --> 52:00.300\n in single celled eukaryotes?\n\n52:00.300 --> 52:01.120\n There probably is.\n\n52:01.120 --> 52:02.940\n It's just that I don't know very much about it.\n\n52:02.940 --> 52:03.780\n By the time we get onto...\n\n52:03.780 --> 52:05.700\n You don't hang out with the eukaryotes.\n\n52:05.700 --> 52:07.380\n Well, I do all the time, but...\n\n52:07.380 --> 52:09.020\n But you can't communicate with them yet.\n\n52:09.020 --> 52:10.980\n Yeah, a peacock or something.\n\n52:10.980 --> 52:11.820\n Yes.\n\n52:12.780 --> 52:14.180\n The kind of standard answer,\n\n52:14.180 --> 52:15.520\n this is not quite what I work on,\n\n52:15.520 --> 52:19.780\n but the standard answer is that it's female mate choice.\n\n52:19.780 --> 52:22.980\n She is looking for good genes.\n\n52:22.980 --> 52:25.660\n And if you can have a tail that's like this\n\n52:25.660 --> 52:28.100\n and still survive, still be alive,\n\n52:28.100 --> 52:30.420\n not actually have been taken down by the nearest predator,\n\n52:30.420 --> 52:31.780\n then you must've got pretty good genes\n\n52:31.780 --> 52:36.460\n because despite this handicap, you're able to survive.\n\n52:36.460 --> 52:38.340\n So those are like human interpretable things,\n\n52:38.340 --> 52:39.220\n like with a peacock.\n\n52:39.220 --> 52:43.020\n But I wonder, I'm sure echoes of the same thing\n\n52:43.020 --> 52:46.540\n are there with more primitive organisms.\n\n52:46.540 --> 52:51.220\n Basically your PR, like how you advertise yourself\n\n52:51.220 --> 52:54.020\n that you're worthy of.\n\n52:54.020 --> 52:54.860\n Absolutely.\n\n52:54.860 --> 52:56.460\n So one big advertisement is the fact\n\n52:56.460 --> 52:58.420\n that you survived it all.\n\n52:58.420 --> 53:03.020\n Let me give you one beautiful example of an algal bloom.\n\n53:03.020 --> 53:05.540\n And this can be a sign of bacteria.\n\n53:05.540 --> 53:07.100\n It's gonna be in bacteria.\n\n53:07.100 --> 53:10.780\n So if suddenly you pump nitrate or phosphate\n\n53:10.780 --> 53:13.340\n or something into the ocean and everything goes green,\n\n53:13.340 --> 53:17.020\n you end up with all this algae growing there.\n\n53:18.180 --> 53:20.860\n A viral infection or something like that\n\n53:20.860 --> 53:23.380\n can kill the entire bloom overnight.\n\n53:23.380 --> 53:26.860\n And it's not that the virus takes out everything overnight.\n\n53:26.860 --> 53:29.700\n It's that most of the cells in that bloom kill themselves\n\n53:29.700 --> 53:31.900\n before the virus can get onto them.\n\n53:31.900 --> 53:33.740\n And it's through a form of cell death\n\n53:33.740 --> 53:35.020\n called programmed cell death.\n\n53:35.020 --> 53:36.580\n And we do the same things.\n\n53:36.580 --> 53:39.980\n It's how we have the gaps between our fingers and so on.\n\n53:39.980 --> 53:43.060\n It's how we craft synapses in the brain.\n\n53:43.060 --> 53:47.420\n It's fundamental again to multicellular life.\n\n53:47.420 --> 53:51.220\n They have the same machinery in these algal blooms.\n\n53:51.220 --> 53:52.900\n How do they know who dies?\n\n53:52.900 --> 53:56.740\n The answer is they will often put out a toxin.\n\n53:56.740 --> 54:00.300\n And that toxin is kind of a challenge to you.\n\n54:00.300 --> 54:03.420\n Either you can cope with the toxin or you can't.\n\n54:03.420 --> 54:06.460\n If you can cope with it, you form a spore\n\n54:06.460 --> 54:09.100\n and you will go on to become the next generation.\n\n54:09.100 --> 54:11.940\n You're forming kind of a resistance spore.\n\n54:11.940 --> 54:14.180\n You sink down a little bit, you get out of the way,\n\n54:14.180 --> 54:17.540\n you're out of the, you can't be attacked by a virus\n\n54:17.540 --> 54:19.660\n if you're a spore or it's not so easily.\n\n54:19.660 --> 54:21.900\n Whereas if you can't deal with that toxin,\n\n54:21.900 --> 54:25.700\n you pull the plug and you trigger your death apparatus\n\n54:25.700 --> 54:27.100\n and you kill yourself.\n\n54:27.100 --> 54:29.140\n Oh, so it's truly life and death selection.\n\n54:29.140 --> 54:31.620\n Yeah, so it's really, it's a challenge.\n\n54:31.620 --> 54:33.620\n And this is a bit like sexual selection.\n\n54:33.620 --> 54:36.940\n It's not so, they're all pretty much genetically identical,\n\n54:36.940 --> 54:39.020\n but they've had different life histories.\n\n54:39.020 --> 54:41.420\n So have you had a tough day?\n\n54:41.420 --> 54:44.460\n Did you happen to get infected by this virus?\n\n54:44.460 --> 54:45.540\n Or did you run out of iron?\n\n54:45.540 --> 54:47.460\n Or did you get a bit too much sun?\n\n54:47.460 --> 54:51.180\n Whatever it may be, if this extra stress of the toxin\n\n54:51.180 --> 54:52.820\n just pushes you over the edge,\n\n54:52.820 --> 54:53.980\n then you have this binary choice.\n\n54:53.980 --> 54:55.180\n Either you're the next generation\n\n54:55.180 --> 54:57.920\n or you kill yourself now using this same machinery.\n\n54:57.920 --> 55:00.660\n It's also actually exactly the way I approach dating,\n\n55:00.660 --> 55:03.220\n but that's probably why I'm single.\n\n55:03.220 --> 55:07.360\n Okay, what about if we can step back, DNA?\n\n55:07.360 --> 55:10.460\n Just mechanism of storing information.\n\n55:10.460 --> 55:13.460\n RNA, DNA, how big of an invention was that?\n\n55:13.460 --> 55:16.180\n That seems to be, that seems to be fundamental\n\n55:16.180 --> 55:21.180\n to like something deep within what life is,\n\n55:22.540 --> 55:24.060\n is the ability, as you said,\n\n55:24.060 --> 55:28.000\n to kind of store and propagate information.\n\n55:28.000 --> 55:29.900\n But then you also kind of infer that\n\n55:29.900 --> 55:31.600\n with your and your students work,\n\n55:31.600 --> 55:35.140\n that there's a deep connection between the chemistry\n\n55:35.140 --> 55:39.060\n and the ability to have this kind of genetic information.\n\n55:39.060 --> 55:41.140\n So how big of an invention is it\n\n55:41.140 --> 55:43.740\n to have a nice representation,\n\n55:43.740 --> 55:46.300\n nice hard drive for info to pass on?\n\n55:46.300 --> 55:47.940\n Huge, I suspect.\n\n55:47.940 --> 55:50.580\n I mean, but when I was talking about the code,\n\n55:50.580 --> 55:52.600\n you see the code in RNA as well.\n\n55:52.600 --> 55:55.040\n And RNA almost certainly came first.\n\n55:56.100 --> 55:58.580\n And there's been an idea going back decades\n\n55:58.580 --> 55:59.740\n called the RNA world,\n\n55:59.740 --> 56:03.060\n because RNA in theory can copy itself\n\n56:03.060 --> 56:04.900\n and can catalyze reactions.\n\n56:04.900 --> 56:07.860\n So it kind of cuts out this chicken and egg loop.\n\n56:07.860 --> 56:09.900\n So DNA as possible is not that special.\n\n56:09.900 --> 56:13.560\n So RNA, RNA is the thing that does the work really.\n\n56:13.560 --> 56:15.340\n And the code lies in RNA.\n\n56:15.340 --> 56:16.900\n The code lies in the interactions\n\n56:16.900 --> 56:18.340\n between RNA and amino acids.\n\n56:18.340 --> 56:21.700\n And it still is there today in the ribosome, for example,\n\n56:21.700 --> 56:23.820\n which is just kind of a giant ribozyme,\n\n56:23.820 --> 56:26.500\n which is to say it's an enzyme that's made of RNA.\n\n56:28.200 --> 56:33.200\n So getting to RNA, I suspect is probably not that hard,\n\n56:34.180 --> 56:37.180\n but getting from RNA, how do you,\n\n56:37.180 --> 56:39.860\n you know, there's multiple different types of RNA now.\n\n56:39.860 --> 56:42.380\n How do you distinguish?\n\n56:42.380 --> 56:43.860\n This is something we're actively thinking about.\n\n56:43.860 --> 56:45.580\n How do you distinguish between,\n\n56:45.580 --> 56:47.220\n you know, a random population of RNA?\n\n56:47.220 --> 56:50.300\n Some of them go on to become messenger RNA.\n\n56:50.300 --> 56:52.540\n This is the transcript of the code\n\n56:52.540 --> 56:54.240\n of the gene that you want to make.\n\n56:54.240 --> 56:56.860\n Some of them become transfer RNA,\n\n56:56.860 --> 56:59.900\n which is kind of the unit that holds the amino acid\n\n56:59.900 --> 57:01.720\n that's going to be polymerized.\n\n57:01.720 --> 57:04.300\n Some of them become ribosomal RNA,\n\n57:04.300 --> 57:07.540\n which is the machine which is joining them all up together.\n\n57:07.540 --> 57:10.140\n How do they discriminate themselves?\n\n57:10.140 --> 57:12.340\n And, you know, is some kind of phase transition\n\n57:12.340 --> 57:13.180\n going on there?\n\n57:13.180 --> 57:14.220\n I don't know.\n\n57:14.220 --> 57:16.060\n It's a difficult question.\n\n57:16.060 --> 57:18.300\n And we're now in the region of biology\n\n57:18.300 --> 57:19.700\n where information is coming in.\n\n57:19.700 --> 57:22.940\n But the thing about RNA is very, very good at what it does.\n\n57:22.940 --> 57:25.620\n But the largest genome supported by RNA\n\n57:25.620 --> 57:28.880\n are RNA viruses like HIV, for example.\n\n57:28.880 --> 57:29.880\n They're pretty small.\n\n57:29.880 --> 57:34.660\n And so there's a limit to how complex life could be\n\n57:34.660 --> 57:36.380\n unless you come up with DNA,\n\n57:36.380 --> 57:39.220\n which chemically is a really small change.\n\n57:39.220 --> 57:41.780\n But how easy it is to make that change,\n\n57:41.780 --> 57:42.620\n I don't really know.\n\n57:42.620 --> 57:43.980\n As soon as you've got DNA,\n\n57:43.980 --> 57:46.660\n then you've got an amazingly stable molecule\n\n57:46.660 --> 57:48.440\n for information storage.\n\n57:48.440 --> 57:50.580\n And you can do absolutely anything.\n\n57:50.580 --> 57:53.260\n But how likely that transition from RNA to DNA was,\n\n57:53.260 --> 57:54.460\n I don't know either.\n\n57:54.460 --> 57:56.920\n How much possibility is there for variety\n\n57:56.920 --> 58:00.440\n in ways to store information?\n\n58:00.440 --> 58:01.480\n Because it seems to be very,\n\n58:01.480 --> 58:03.040\n there's specific characteristics\n\n58:03.040 --> 58:06.600\n about the programming language of DNA.\n\n58:06.600 --> 58:08.320\n Yeah, there's a lot of work going on\n\n58:08.320 --> 58:11.880\n on what's called the xenodNA or RNA.\n\n58:11.880 --> 58:15.440\n Can we replace the bases themselves,\n\n58:15.440 --> 58:18.320\n the letters, if you like, in RNA or DNA?\n\n58:18.320 --> 58:19.880\n Can we replace the backbone?\n\n58:19.880 --> 58:23.240\n Can we replace, for example, phosphate with arsenate?\n\n58:23.240 --> 58:25.940\n Can we replace the sugar ribose or deoxyribose\n\n58:25.940 --> 58:26.780\n with a different sugar?\n\n58:26.780 --> 58:28.240\n And the answer is yes, you can.\n\n58:29.880 --> 58:34.240\n Within limits, there's not an infinite space there.\n\n58:34.240 --> 58:36.080\n Arsenate doesn't really work\n\n58:36.080 --> 58:38.000\n if the bonds are not as strong as phosphate.\n\n58:38.000 --> 58:40.300\n It's probably quite hard to replace phosphate.\n\n58:42.360 --> 58:43.520\n It's possible to do it.\n\n58:43.520 --> 58:47.560\n The question to me is why is it this way?\n\n58:47.560 --> 58:50.300\n Is it because there was some form of selection\n\n58:50.300 --> 58:52.160\n that this is better than the other forms\n\n58:52.160 --> 58:53.720\n and there were lots of competing forms\n\n58:53.720 --> 58:55.160\n of information storage early on\n\n58:55.160 --> 58:56.840\n and this one was the one that worked out?\n\n58:56.840 --> 58:58.520\n Or was it kind of channeled that way,\n\n58:58.520 --> 59:01.960\n that these are the molecules that you're dealing with\n\n59:01.960 --> 59:03.960\n and they work?\n\n59:03.960 --> 59:05.840\n And I'm increasingly thinking it's that way,\n\n59:05.840 --> 59:08.880\n that we're channeled towards ribose, phosphate,\n\n59:08.880 --> 59:11.960\n and the bases that are used.\n\n59:11.960 --> 59:14.560\n But there are 200 different letters\n\n59:14.560 --> 59:17.160\n kicking around out there that could have been used.\n\n59:17.160 --> 59:18.280\n It's such an interesting question.\n\n59:18.280 --> 59:21.840\n If you look in the programming world in computer science,\n\n59:21.840 --> 59:24.200\n there's a programming language called JavaScript,\n\n59:24.200 --> 59:26.360\n which was written super quickly.\n\n59:26.360 --> 59:29.440\n It's a giant mess, but it took over the world.\n\n59:29.440 --> 59:30.280\n And it was kind of a...\n\n59:30.280 --> 59:31.320\n Sounds very biological.\n\n59:31.320 --> 59:35.080\n It was kind of a running joke that like,\n\n59:35.080 --> 59:37.800\n like surely this can't be,\n\n59:37.800 --> 59:39.560\n this is a terrible programming language.\n\n59:39.560 --> 59:40.400\n It's a giant mess.\n\n59:40.400 --> 59:41.760\n It's full of bugs.\n\n59:41.760 --> 59:44.080\n It's so easy to write really crappy code,\n\n59:44.080 --> 59:48.040\n but it took over all a front end development\n\n59:48.040 --> 59:49.340\n in the web browser.\n\n59:49.340 --> 59:52.280\n If you have any kind of dynamic interactive website,\n\n59:52.280 --> 59:54.940\n it's usually running JavaScript.\n\n59:54.940 --> 59:57.840\n And it's now taking over much of the backend,\n\n59:57.840 --> 1:00:00.920\n which is like the serious heavy duty computational stuff.\n\n1:00:00.920 --> 1:00:02.700\n And it's become super fast\n\n1:00:02.700 --> 1:00:06.560\n with the different compilation engines that are running it.\n\n1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:08.120\n So it's like, it really took over the world.\n\n1:00:08.120 --> 1:00:13.120\n It's very possible that this initially crappy derided language\n\n1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:14.880\n actually takes everything over.\n\n1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:16.220\n And then the question is,\n\n1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:21.800\n did human civilization always strive towards JavaScript?\n\n1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:25.160\n Or was JavaScript just the first programming language\n\n1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:27.200\n that ran on the browser and still sticky?\n\n1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:29.880\n The first is the sticky one.\n\n1:00:29.880 --> 1:00:32.680\n And so it wins over anything else because it was first.\n\n1:00:32.680 --> 1:00:34.640\n And I don't think that's answerable, right?\n\n1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.160\n But it's good to ask that.\n\n1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:38.920\n I suppose in the lab,\n\n1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:43.400\n you can't run it with programming languages,\n\n1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:47.440\n but in biology you can probably do some kind of\n\n1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:52.440\n small scale evolutionary test to try to infer,\n\n1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:54.760\n which is which.\n\n1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:55.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:55.600 --> 1:00:57.040\n I mean, in a way we've got the hardware\n\n1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:58.640\n and the software here.\n\n1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:02.880\n And the hardware is maybe the DNA and the RNA itself.\n\n1:01:02.880 --> 1:01:06.200\n And then the software perhaps is more about the code.\n\n1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:07.440\n Did the code have to be this way?\n\n1:01:07.440 --> 1:01:09.360\n Could it have been a different way?\n\n1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:11.440\n People talk about the optimization of the code\n\n1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:14.040\n and there's some suggestion for that.\n\n1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:16.080\n I think it's weak actually.\n\n1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:17.560\n But you could imagine you could come out\n\n1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:18.840\n with a million different codes\n\n1:01:18.840 --> 1:01:20.840\n and this would be one of the best ones.\n\n1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:24.320\n Well, we don't know this.\n\n1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:27.400\n Well, I mean, people have tried to model it\n\n1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:30.200\n based on the effect that mutations would have.\n\n1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:32.040\n So no, you're right.\n\n1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:34.120\n We don't know because that's a single assumption\n\n1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:37.760\n that a mutation is what's being selected on there.\n\n1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:39.320\n And there's other possibilities too.\n\n1:01:39.320 --> 1:01:41.160\n I mean, there does seem to be a resilience\n\n1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:43.200\n and a redundancy to the whole thing.\n\n1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:47.640\n It's hard to mess up and the way you mess it up\n\n1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:51.600\n often is likely to produce interesting results.\n\n1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:52.760\n So it's...\n\n1:01:52.760 --> 1:01:55.480\n Are you talking about JavaScript or the genetic code now?\n\n1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:57.840\n Yeah, well, I mean, it's almost,\n\n1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.640\n biology is underpinned by this kind of mess as well.\n\n1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:03.400\n And you look at the human genome and it's full of stuff\n\n1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:06.160\n that is really either broken or dysfunctional\n\n1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.080\n or was a virus once, whatever it may be.\n\n1:02:08.080 --> 1:02:09.280\n And somehow it works.\n\n1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:11.640\n And maybe we need a lot of this mess.\n\n1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:15.400\n We know that some functional genes are taken from this mess.\n\n1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:19.560\n So what about, you mentioned the predatory behavior.\n\n1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:20.400\n Yeah.\n\n1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:21.440\n We talked about sex.\n\n1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:24.720\n What about violence, predator and prey dynamics?\n\n1:02:26.840 --> 1:02:28.520\n When was that invented?\n\n1:02:29.600 --> 1:02:33.920\n And poetic and biological ways of putting it,\n\n1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:37.400\n how do you describe predator prey relationship?\n\n1:02:37.400 --> 1:02:41.800\n Is it a beautiful dance or is it a violent atrocity?\n\n1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.360\n Well, I guess it's both, isn't it?\n\n1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:45.360\n I mean, when does it start?\n\n1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:46.920\n It starts in bacteria.\n\n1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.280\n You see these amazing predators.\n\n1:02:49.280 --> 1:02:51.640\n Della Vibrio is one that Lynn Margulis\n\n1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.760\n used to talk about a lot.\n\n1:02:53.760 --> 1:02:55.600\n It's got a kind of a drill piece\n\n1:02:55.600 --> 1:02:57.240\n that drills through the wall\n\n1:02:57.240 --> 1:02:58.720\n and the membrane of the bacterium.\n\n1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:00.560\n And then it effectively eats the bacterium\n\n1:03:00.560 --> 1:03:03.560\n from just inside the periplasmic space\n\n1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:04.960\n and makes copies of itself that way.\n\n1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:06.360\n So that's straight predation.\n\n1:03:06.360 --> 1:03:08.360\n There are predators among bacteria.\n\n1:03:08.360 --> 1:03:10.280\n So predation in that, sorry to interrupt,\n\n1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:12.560\n means you murder somebody\n\n1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:17.560\n and use their body as a resource in some way.\n\n1:03:17.600 --> 1:03:18.440\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:21.440\n But it's not parasitic in that\n\n1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:23.400\n you need them to be still alive.\n\n1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:26.360\n No, no, I mean, predation is you kill them, really.\n\n1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:27.200\n You murder.\n\n1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:29.440\n Parasites, so you kind of live on them.\n\n1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.080\n Okay, so, but it seems the predator is the really popular.\n\n1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:39.080\n So what we see if we go back 560, 570 million years\n\n1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:44.200\n before the Cambrian explosion,\n\n1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:48.600\n there is what's known as the Ediacaran fauna,\n\n1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:50.200\n or sometimes they call Vendobionts,\n\n1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:51.760\n which is a lovely name.\n\n1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:55.680\n And it's not obvious that they're animals at all.\n\n1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:56.720\n They're stalked things.\n\n1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:59.200\n They often have fronds that look a lot like leaves\n\n1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:01.960\n with kind of fractal branching patterns on them.\n\n1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:05.640\n And the thing is, they're found,\n\n1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:09.480\n sometimes geologists can figure out the environment\n\n1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:10.840\n that they were in and say,\n\n1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:12.480\n this is more than 200 meters deep\n\n1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:14.560\n because there's no sign of any waves.\n\n1:04:14.560 --> 1:04:18.600\n There's no storm damage down here, this kind of thing.\n\n1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:19.760\n They were more than 200 meters deep,\n\n1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:21.800\n so they're definitely not photosynthetic.\n\n1:04:21.800 --> 1:04:25.400\n These are animals and they're filter feeders.\n\n1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:27.720\n And we know sponges and corals and things\n\n1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.040\n are filter feeding animals.\n\n1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:30.560\n They're stuck to the spot.\n\n1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:32.920\n And little bits of carbon that come their way,\n\n1:04:32.920 --> 1:04:35.320\n they filter it out and that's what they're eating.\n\n1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:38.480\n So no predation involved in this,\n\n1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:40.680\n beyond stuff just dies anyway.\n\n1:04:40.680 --> 1:04:43.360\n And it feels like a very gentle, rather beautiful,\n\n1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:45.720\n rather limited world, you might say.\n\n1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:47.480\n There's not a lot going on there.\n\n1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:51.720\n And something changes.\n\n1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:53.920\n Oxygen definitely changes during this period.\n\n1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:55.360\n Other things may have changed as well.\n\n1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:58.280\n But the next thing you really see in the fossil record\n\n1:04:58.280 --> 1:05:00.600\n is the Cambrian explosion.\n\n1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:02.080\n And what do we see there?\n\n1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:04.800\n We're now seeing animals that we would recognize.\n\n1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:07.760\n They've got eyes, they've got claws, they've got shells.\n\n1:05:07.760 --> 1:05:12.760\n They're plainly killing things or running away and hiding.\n\n1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:18.680\n And so we've gone from a rather gentle but limited world\n\n1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:23.080\n to a rather vicious, unpleasant world that we recognize\n\n1:05:23.080 --> 1:05:27.520\n and which leads to kind of arms races,\n\n1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:31.160\n evolutionary arms races, which again is something\n\n1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:32.920\n that when we think about a nuclear arms race,\n\n1:05:32.920 --> 1:05:34.880\n we think, Jesus, we don't want to go there.\n\n1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:37.400\n It's not done anybody any good.\n\n1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:40.160\n In some ways, maybe it does do good.\n\n1:05:40.160 --> 1:05:42.760\n I don't want to make an argument for nuclear arms.\n\n1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:47.760\n But predation as a mechanism forces organisms\n\n1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:52.320\n to adapt to change to be better to escape or to kill.\n\n1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:55.920\n If you need to eat, then you've got to eat.\n\n1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:57.840\n And a cheetah's not going to run at that speed\n\n1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:02.840\n unless it has to because the zebra is capable of escaping.\n\n1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:07.840\n So it leads to much greater feats of evolution\n\n1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:09.880\n than would ever have been possible without it.\n\n1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:12.680\n And in the end, to a much more beautiful world.\n\n1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:17.680\n And so it's not all bad by any means.\n\n1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:19.320\n But the thing is you can't have this\n\n1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:21.080\n if you don't have an oxygenated planet.\n\n1:06:21.080 --> 1:06:24.120\n Because it's all in the end, it's about how much energy\n\n1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:26.640\n can you extract from the food you eat.\n\n1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:28.360\n And if you don't have an oxygenated planet,\n\n1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:32.240\n you can get about 10% out, not much more than that.\n\n1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.120\n And if you've got an oxygenated planet,\n\n1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:35.960\n you can get about 40% out.\n\n1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:37.040\n And that means you can have,\n\n1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:40.440\n instead of having one or two trophic levels,\n\n1:06:40.440 --> 1:06:42.760\n you can have five or six trophic levels.\n\n1:06:42.760 --> 1:06:44.360\n And that means things can eat things\n\n1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:45.720\n that eat other things and so on.\n\n1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:48.920\n And you've gone to a level of ecological complexity,\n\n1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:51.720\n which is completely impossible in the absence of oxygen.\n\n1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:54.400\n This reminds me of the Hunter S. Thompson quote,\n\n1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:56.840\n that for every moment of triumph,\n\n1:06:56.840 --> 1:07:00.960\n for every instance of beauty, many souls must be trampled.\n\n1:07:02.040 --> 1:07:05.120\n The history of life on Earth, unfortunately,\n\n1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:09.000\n is that of violence.\n\n1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:13.320\n Just the trillions and trillions of multi cell organisms\n\n1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:17.040\n that were murdered in the struggle for survival.\n\n1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:20.360\n It's a sorry statement, but yes, it's basically true.\n\n1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:23.960\n And that somehow is a catalyst\n\n1:07:23.960 --> 1:07:26.220\n from an evolutionary perspective for creativity,\n\n1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:28.880\n for creating more and more complex organisms\n\n1:07:28.880 --> 1:07:30.160\n that are better and better at surviving.\n\n1:07:30.160 --> 1:07:32.080\n I mean, survival of the fittest,\n\n1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:33.520\n if you just go back to that old phrase,\n\n1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:36.280\n means death of the weakest.\n\n1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:38.480\n Now, what's fit, what's weak,\n\n1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:41.400\n these are terms that don't have much intrinsic meaning.\n\n1:07:41.400 --> 1:07:45.280\n But the thing is, evolution only happens because of death.\n\n1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:49.000\n One way to die is the constraints,\n\n1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.160\n the scarcity of the resources in the environment,\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.280\n but that seems to be not nearly as good of a mechanism\n\n1:07:56.280 --> 1:07:59.480\n for death than other creatures\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:01.480\n roaming about in the environment.\n\n1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:04.160\n When I say environment, I mean like the static environment,\n\n1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:05.880\n but then there's the dynamic environment\n\n1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:08.360\n of bigger things trying to eat you\n\n1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:10.600\n and use you for your energy.\n\n1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:13.280\n It forces you to come up with a solution\n\n1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:16.920\n to your specific problem that is inventive\n\n1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:18.800\n and is new and hasn't been done before.\n\n1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:22.560\n And so it forces, I mean, literally change,\n\n1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:26.000\n literally evolution on populations.\n\n1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.400\n They have to become different.\n\n1:08:27.400 --> 1:08:30.000\n And it's interesting that humans have channeled that\n\n1:08:30.900 --> 1:08:34.220\n into more, I mean, I guess what humans are doing\n\n1:08:34.220 --> 1:08:37.760\n is they're inventing more productive\n\n1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:39.880\n and safe ways of doing that.\n\n1:08:39.880 --> 1:08:41.520\n You know, this whole idea of morality\n\n1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.360\n and all those kinds of things,\n\n1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:47.240\n I think they ultimately lead to competition\n\n1:08:48.360 --> 1:08:51.600\n versus violence, because I think violence\n\n1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:56.560\n can have a cold, brutal, inefficient aspect to it.\n\n1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:01.280\n But if you channel that into more controlled competition\n\n1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:05.480\n in the space of ideas, in the space of approaches to life,\n\n1:09:05.480 --> 1:09:10.280\n maybe you can be even more productive than evolution is.\n\n1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:12.200\n Because evolution is very wasteful.\n\n1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:14.680\n Like the amount of murder required\n\n1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:16.600\n to really test a good idea,\n\n1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:19.520\n genetically speaking, is just a lot.\n\n1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:21.120\n Many, many, many generations.\n\n1:09:21.120 --> 1:09:24.560\n Morally, we cannot base society\n\n1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:26.280\n on the way that evolution works.\n\n1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:27.280\n That's an invention, right?\n\n1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:29.600\n But actually, in some respects we do,\n\n1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:31.440\n which is to say, this is how science works.\n\n1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:34.000\n We have competing hypotheses that have to get better,\n\n1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.360\n otherwise they die.\n\n1:09:35.360 --> 1:09:36.640\n It's the way that society works.\n\n1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.040\n You know, in ancient Greece, we had the Athens\n\n1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:42.520\n and Sparta and city states,\n\n1:09:42.520 --> 1:09:45.360\n and then we had the Renaissance and nation states,\n\n1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:48.400\n and universities compete with each other.\n\n1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:50.560\n Tremendous amount of companies competing\n\n1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:51.680\n with each other all the time.\n\n1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.640\n It drives innovation.\n\n1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:57.400\n And if we want to do it without all the death\n\n1:09:57.400 --> 1:09:59.040\n that we see in nature,\n\n1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:03.320\n then we have to have some kind of societal level control\n\n1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:05.480\n that says, well, there's some limits, guys,\n\n1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:07.240\n and these are what the limits are gonna be.\n\n1:10:07.240 --> 1:10:08.760\n And society as a whole has to say,\n\n1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:10.920\n right, we want to limit the amount of death here,\n\n1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:12.720\n so you can't do this and you can't do that.\n\n1:10:12.720 --> 1:10:14.280\n And you know, who makes up these rules,\n\n1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.120\n and how do we know?\n\n1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:16.960\n It's a tough thing, but it's basically\n\n1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:19.440\n trying to find a moral basis\n\n1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:22.960\n for avoiding the death of evolution and natural selection\n\n1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:27.400\n and keeping the innovation and the richness of it.\n\n1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:31.840\n And I forgot who said it, but that murder is illegal.\n\n1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:33.200\n Probably Kurt Vonnegut.\n\n1:10:33.200 --> 1:10:35.440\n Murder is illegal except when it's done\n\n1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:38.240\n to the sound of trumpets and at a large scale.\n\n1:10:38.240 --> 1:10:40.600\n So we still have wars.\n\n1:10:41.720 --> 1:10:44.160\n But we are struggling with this idea\n\n1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:47.280\n that murder is a bad thing.\n\n1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:49.760\n It's so interesting how we're channeling\n\n1:10:49.760 --> 1:10:53.240\n the best of the evolutionary imperative\n\n1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:58.240\n and trying to get rid of the stuff that's not productive.\n\n1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:00.600\n Trying to almost accelerate evolution.\n\n1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:05.600\n The same kind of thing that makes evolution creative.\n\n1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:07.360\n We're trying to use that.\n\n1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:08.640\n I think we naturally do it.\n\n1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:10.640\n I mean, I don't think we can help ourselves do it.\n\n1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:13.280\n And you know, capitalism as a form\n\n1:11:13.280 --> 1:11:17.200\n is basically about competition and differential rewards.\n\n1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.720\n But we, society, and you know, we have a,\n\n1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:25.200\n I keep using this word moral obligation,\n\n1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:28.680\n but you know, we cannot operate as a society\n\n1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:29.800\n if we go that way.\n\n1:11:29.800 --> 1:11:34.800\n It's interesting that we've had problems achieving balance.\n\n1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:39.320\n So for example, in the financial crash in 2009,\n\n1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:41.240\n do you let banks go to the wall or not?\n\n1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:42.960\n This kind of question.\n\n1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:45.040\n In evolution, certainly you let them go to the wall.\n\n1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:47.840\n And in that sense, you don't need the regulation\n\n1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:49.560\n because they just die.\n\n1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:53.840\n Whereas if we, as a society,\n\n1:11:53.840 --> 1:11:56.320\n think about what's required for society as a whole,\n\n1:11:56.320 --> 1:11:59.440\n then you don't necessarily let them go to the wall.\n\n1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:01.480\n In which case you then have to impose\n\n1:12:01.480 --> 1:12:05.440\n some kind of regulation that the bankers themselves will,\n\n1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:07.240\n in an evolutionary manner, exploit.\n\n1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:11.360\n Yeah, we've been struggling with this kind of idea\n\n1:12:11.360 --> 1:12:16.120\n of capitalism, the cold brutality of capitalism\n\n1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:18.920\n that seems to create so much beautiful things\n\n1:12:18.920 --> 1:12:20.320\n in this world.\n\n1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:23.200\n And then the ideals of communism\n\n1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:26.640\n that seem to create so much brutal destruction in history.\n\n1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.720\n We struggle with ideas of,\n\n1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:30.560\n well, maybe we didn't do it right.\n\n1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:31.760\n How can we do things better?\n\n1:12:31.760 --> 1:12:33.480\n And then the ideas are the things\n\n1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:35.960\n where we're playing with as opposed to people.\n\n1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:37.720\n If a PhD student has a bad idea,\n\n1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:39.600\n we don't shoot the PhD student.\n\n1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:42.080\n We just criticize their idea and hope they improve.\n\n1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.040\n You have a very humane lab.\n\n1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:46.560\n Yeah, I don't know how you guys do it.\n\n1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:49.360\n The way I run things, it's always life and death.\n\n1:12:49.360 --> 1:12:52.480\n Okay, so it is interesting about humans\n\n1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:54.760\n that there is an inner sense of morality\n\n1:12:54.760 --> 1:12:59.760\n which begs the question of how did homo sapiens evolve?\n\n1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:04.320\n If we think about the invention of,\n\n1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:09.200\n early invention of sex and early invention of predation,\n\n1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:15.440\n what was the thing invented to make humans?\n\n1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:17.160\n What would you say?\n\n1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:19.120\n I mean, I suppose a couple of things I'd say.\n\n1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:21.360\n Number one is you don't have to wind the clock back\n\n1:13:21.360 --> 1:13:24.160\n very far, five, six million years or so,\n\n1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:26.640\n and let it run forwards again.\n\n1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:29.000\n And the chances of humans as we know them\n\n1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.040\n is not necessarily that high.\n\n1:13:31.040 --> 1:13:34.560\n You know, imagine as an alien, you find planet Earth\n\n1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.280\n and it's got everything apart from humans on it.\n\n1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:39.360\n It's an amazing, wonderful, marvelous planet,\n\n1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:41.320\n but nothing that we would recognize\n\n1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.640\n as extremely intelligent life,\n\n1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:45.840\n kind of space faring civilization.\n\n1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:46.960\n So when we think about aliens,\n\n1:13:46.960 --> 1:13:49.760\n we're kind of after something like ourselves.\n\n1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:51.800\n We're after a space faring civilization.\n\n1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:55.840\n We're not after zebras and giraffes and lions and things,\n\n1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:57.720\n amazing though they are.\n\n1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:01.280\n But the additional kind of evolutionary steps\n\n1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.120\n to go from large, complex mammals, monkeys, let's say,\n\n1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:11.120\n to humans doesn't strike me as that long a distance.\n\n1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.440\n It's all about the brain.\n\n1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:17.040\n And where's the brain and morality coming from?\n\n1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.880\n It seems to me to be all about groups,\n\n1:14:19.880 --> 1:14:22.440\n human groups and interactions between groups.\n\n1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.480\n The collective intelligence of it.\n\n1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:26.680\n Yes, the interactions really.\n\n1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:30.080\n And there's a guy at UCL called Mark Thomas,\n\n1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:32.000\n who's done a lot of really beautiful work,\n\n1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.560\n I think, on this kind of question.\n\n1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:34.920\n So I talk to him every now and then,\n\n1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:37.240\n so my views are influenced by him.\n\n1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:43.080\n But a lot seems to depend on population density,\n\n1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:45.520\n that the more interactions you have going on\n\n1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:49.200\n between different groups, the more transfer of information,\n\n1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.040\n if you like, between groups,\n\n1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:53.600\n people moving from one group to another group,\n\n1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:56.000\n almost like lateral gene transfer in bacteria,\n\n1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:01.000\n the more expertise you're able to develop and maintain,\n\n1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:04.480\n the more culturally complex your society can become.\n\n1:15:04.480 --> 1:15:06.720\n And groups that have become detached,\n\n1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:09.240\n like on Easter Island, for example,\n\n1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:12.480\n very often degenerate in terms of the complexity\n\n1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:13.560\n of their civilization.\n\n1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:16.080\n Is that true for complex organisms in general?\n\n1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:19.160\n Population density is often productive.\n\n1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:21.120\n Really matters, but in human terms,\n\n1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:26.000\n I don't know what the actual factors were\n\n1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.600\n that were driving a large brain,\n\n1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:32.880\n but you can talk about fire, you can talk about tool use,\n\n1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:34.120\n you can talk about language,\n\n1:15:34.120 --> 1:15:36.720\n and none of them seem to correlate especially well\n\n1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:39.480\n with the actual known trajectory of human evolution\n\n1:15:39.480 --> 1:15:42.760\n in terms of cave art and these kind of things.\n\n1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:45.080\n That seems to work much better\n\n1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:47.520\n just with population density\n\n1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:51.200\n and number of interactions between different groups,\n\n1:15:51.200 --> 1:15:55.840\n all of which is really about human interactions,\n\n1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:58.600\n human human interactions and the complexity of those.\n\n1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:02.040\n But population density is the thing\n\n1:16:02.040 --> 1:16:04.280\n that increases the number of interactions,\n\n1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:06.640\n but then there must have been inventions\n\n1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:12.920\n forced by that number of interactions\n\n1:16:12.920 --> 1:16:14.680\n that actually led to humans.\n\n1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:18.600\n So like Richard Wrangham talks about that\n\n1:16:18.600 --> 1:16:22.040\n it's basically the beta males had to beat up the alpha male.\n\n1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.760\n So that's what collaboration looks like,\n\n1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:26.000\n is they, when you're living together,\n\n1:16:28.480 --> 1:16:33.480\n our early ancestors don't like the dictatorial aspect\n\n1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:36.040\n of a single individual at the top of a tribe.\n\n1:16:36.040 --> 1:16:38.520\n So they learned to collaborate\n\n1:16:38.520 --> 1:16:42.800\n how to basically create a democracy of sorts,\n\n1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:45.200\n a democracy that prevents, minimizes,\n\n1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.320\n or lessens the amount of violence,\n\n1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:50.640\n which essentially gives strength to the tribe\n\n1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:55.040\n and make the war between tribes versus the dictator.\n\n1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:57.280\n I mean, I think one of the most wonderful things\n\n1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:00.360\n about humans is we're all of those things.\n\n1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:03.720\n I mean, we are deeply social as a species\n\n1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:05.360\n and we're also deeply selfish.\n\n1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:06.440\n And it seems to me the conflict\n\n1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:08.400\n between capitalism and communism,\n\n1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:10.400\n it's really just two aspects of human nature,\n\n1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:11.240\n both of which are.\n\n1:17:11.240 --> 1:17:15.120\n We have both and we have a constant kind of vying\n\n1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:16.080\n between the two sides.\n\n1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:19.440\n We really do care about other people beyond our families,\n\n1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:21.120\n beyond our immediate people.\n\n1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:24.600\n We care about society and the society that we live in.\n\n1:17:24.600 --> 1:17:27.120\n And you could say that's a drawing\n\n1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:28.520\n towards socialism or communism.\n\n1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:30.720\n On the other side, we really do care about ourselves.\n\n1:17:30.720 --> 1:17:32.120\n We really do care about our families,\n\n1:17:32.120 --> 1:17:34.760\n about working for something that we gain from.\n\n1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:35.960\n And that's the capitalist side of it.\n\n1:17:35.960 --> 1:17:38.880\n They're both really deeply ingrained in human nature.\n\n1:17:38.880 --> 1:17:43.040\n In terms of violence and interactions between groups,\n\n1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:45.960\n yes, all this dynamic of,\n\n1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:47.160\n if you're interacting between groups,\n\n1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:50.240\n you can be certain that they're gonna be burning each other\n\n1:17:50.240 --> 1:17:53.360\n and all kinds of physical violent interactions as well,\n\n1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:56.600\n which will drive the kind of cleverness\n\n1:17:56.600 --> 1:17:57.840\n of how do you resist this?\n\n1:17:57.840 --> 1:17:59.360\n Let's build a tower.\n\n1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:02.640\n What are we gonna do to prevent being overrun\n\n1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:05.080\n by those marauding gangs from over there?\n\n1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.280\n And you look outside humans\n\n1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:10.640\n and you look at chimps and bonobos and so on,\n\n1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.280\n and they're very, very different structures to society.\n\n1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:16.640\n Chimps tend to have an aggressive alpha male type structure\n\n1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:21.000\n and bonobos, there's basically a female society\n\n1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:22.880\n where the males are predominantly excluded\n\n1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:25.600\n and only brought in at the behest of the female.\n\n1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:29.280\n We have a lot in common with both of those groups.\n\n1:18:29.280 --> 1:18:31.080\n And there's, again, tension there.\n\n1:18:31.080 --> 1:18:33.360\n And probably chimps, more violence,\n\n1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:35.440\n the bonobos, probably more sex.\n\n1:18:35.440 --> 1:18:36.760\n That's another tension.\n\n1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:41.760\n How serious do we wanna be?\n\n1:18:42.240 --> 1:18:44.160\n How much fun we wanna be?\n\n1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:45.960\n Asking for a friend again,\n\n1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:47.920\n what do you think happened to Neanderthals?\n\n1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:52.000\n What did we cheeky humans do to the Neanderthals,\n\n1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:53.040\n Homo sapiens?\n\n1:18:53.040 --> 1:18:54.320\n Do you think we murdered them?\n\n1:18:54.320 --> 1:18:56.760\n Was it, how do we murder them?\n\n1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.180\n How do we outcompete them?\n\n1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:01.240\n Or do we mate them?\n\n1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:02.120\n I don't know.\n\n1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:04.400\n I mean, I think there's unequivocal evidence\n\n1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:05.980\n that we mated with them.\n\n1:19:05.980 --> 1:19:07.720\n We always try to mate with everything.\n\n1:19:07.720 --> 1:19:09.460\n Yes, pretty much.\n\n1:19:09.460 --> 1:19:10.320\n There's some interesting,\n\n1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:12.060\n the first sequences that came along\n\n1:19:12.060 --> 1:19:14.060\n were in mitochondrial DNA.\n\n1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:17.160\n And that was back to about 2002 or thereabouts.\n\n1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:21.240\n What was found was that Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA\n\n1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:23.360\n was very different to human mitochondria.\n\n1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:24.200\n Oh, that's so interesting.\n\n1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:25.040\n You could do a clock on it\n\n1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:26.600\n and it said the divergent state\n\n1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:29.200\n was about 600,000 years ago or something like that.\n\n1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:31.040\n So not so long ago.\n\n1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:33.960\n And then the first full genomes were sequenced\n\n1:19:33.960 --> 1:19:36.240\n maybe 10 years after that.\n\n1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:39.600\n And they showed plenty of signs of mating between.\n\n1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:43.080\n So the mitochondrial DNA effectively says no mating.\n\n1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:47.920\n And the nuclear genes say, yeah, lots of mating.\n\n1:19:47.920 --> 1:19:48.740\n But we don't know.\n\n1:19:48.740 --> 1:19:49.580\n How's that possible?\n\n1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:50.400\n So can you explain the difference\n\n1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:53.840\n between mitochondrial DNA and nucleus?\n\n1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:55.580\n I've talked before about the mitochondria,\n\n1:19:55.580 --> 1:19:57.400\n which are the power packs in cells.\n\n1:19:57.400 --> 1:20:01.400\n These are the paired down control units is their DNA.\n\n1:20:01.400 --> 1:20:03.940\n So it's passed on by the mother only.\n\n1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:07.140\n And in the egg cell,\n\n1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:10.600\n we might have half a million copies of mitochondrial DNA.\n\n1:20:10.600 --> 1:20:15.080\n There's only 37 genes left and they do a,\n\n1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:17.200\n it's basically the control unit of energy production.\n\n1:20:17.200 --> 1:20:18.480\n That's what it's doing.\n\n1:20:18.480 --> 1:20:21.720\n It's a basic old school machine that does.\n\n1:20:21.720 --> 1:20:23.300\n And it's got genes that were considered\n\n1:20:23.300 --> 1:20:24.880\n to be effectively trivial\n\n1:20:24.880 --> 1:20:28.740\n because they did a very narrowly defined job,\n\n1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:30.360\n but they're not trivial in the sense\n\n1:20:30.360 --> 1:20:31.640\n that that narrowly defined job\n\n1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:34.620\n is about everything that is being alive.\n\n1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:38.160\n So they're much easier to sequence.\n\n1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:39.760\n You've got many more copies of these things\n\n1:20:39.760 --> 1:20:42.120\n and you can sequence them very quickly.\n\n1:20:42.120 --> 1:20:43.800\n But the problem is because they go down\n\n1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:46.320\n only the maternal line from mother to daughter,\n\n1:20:46.320 --> 1:20:49.560\n your mitochondrial DNA and mine is going nowhere.\n\n1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:50.960\n It doesn't matter.\n\n1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:53.840\n Any kids we have, they get their mother's mitochondrial DNA\n\n1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:59.520\n except in very, very rare and strange circumstances.\n\n1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:02.280\n And so it tells a different story\n\n1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:06.280\n and it's not a story which is easy to reconcile always.\n\n1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:10.040\n And what it seems to suggest to my mind at least\n\n1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:13.840\n is that there was one way traffic of genes\n\n1:21:13.840 --> 1:21:16.520\n probably going from humans into Neanderthals\n\n1:21:16.520 --> 1:21:18.040\n rather than the other way around.\n\n1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:19.800\n Why did the Neanderthals disappear?\n\n1:21:19.800 --> 1:21:20.800\n I don't know.\n\n1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:23.640\n I mean, I suspect that they were,\n\n1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.600\n I suspect they were probably less violent,\n\n1:21:25.600 --> 1:21:31.560\n less clever, less populous, less willing to fight.\n\n1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:32.520\n I don't know.\n\n1:21:32.520 --> 1:21:34.760\n I mean, I think it probably drove them to extinction\n\n1:21:34.760 --> 1:21:35.960\n at the margins of Europe.\n\n1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:39.080\n And it's interesting how much,\n\n1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.440\n if we ran Earth over and over again,\n\n1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:45.360\n how many of these branches of intelligent beings\n\n1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:47.600\n that have figured out some kind of\n\n1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:52.560\n how to leverage collective intelligence,\n\n1:21:52.560 --> 1:21:53.760\n which ones of them emerge?\n\n1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:55.640\n Which ones of them succeed?\n\n1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:57.760\n Is it the more violent ones?\n\n1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:01.320\n Is it the more isolated ones?\n\n1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.760\n Like what dynamics result in more productivity?\n\n1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:06.400\n And I suppose we'll never know.\n\n1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:07.840\n The more complex the organism,\n\n1:22:07.840 --> 1:22:10.600\n the harder it is to run the experiment in the lab.\n\n1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:12.120\n Yes.\n\n1:22:12.120 --> 1:22:15.160\n And in some respects, maybe it's best if we don't know.\n\n1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:16.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.120\n The truth might be very painful.\n\n1:22:18.120 --> 1:22:20.640\n What about if we actually step back\n\n1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:23.040\n a couple of interesting things that we humans do?\n\n1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:28.840\n One is object manipulation and movement.\n\n1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:32.080\n And of course, movement was something that was done,\n\n1:22:32.080 --> 1:22:33.760\n that was another big invention,\n\n1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:36.080\n being able to move around the environment.\n\n1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.400\n And the other one is this sensory mechanism,\n\n1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:41.040\n how we sense the environment.\n\n1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:44.000\n One of the coolest high definition ones is vision.\n\n1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:47.120\n How big are those inventions\n\n1:22:47.120 --> 1:22:50.840\n in the history of life on Earth?\n\n1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:55.040\n Vision, movement, I mean, again, extremely important,\n\n1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:56.760\n going back to the origin of animals,\n\n1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:59.560\n the Cambrian explosion where suddenly you're seeing eyes\n\n1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:01.080\n in the fossil record.\n\n1:23:01.080 --> 1:23:03.720\n And you can, it's not necessarily, again,\n\n1:23:03.720 --> 1:23:05.800\n lots of people historically have said\n\n1:23:05.800 --> 1:23:06.920\n what use is half an eye?\n\n1:23:06.920 --> 1:23:10.640\n And you can go in a series of steps\n\n1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:15.640\n from a light sensitive spot on a flat piece of tissue\n\n1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:20.360\n to an eyeball with a lens and so on.\n\n1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:23.080\n If you assume no more than, I don't remember,\n\n1:23:23.080 --> 1:23:25.120\n this was a specific model that I have in mind,\n\n1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:28.480\n but it was 1% change or half a percent change\n\n1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:29.440\n for each generation.\n\n1:23:29.440 --> 1:23:31.560\n How long would it take to evolve an eye as we know it?\n\n1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:34.000\n And the answer is half a million years.\n\n1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.560\n It doesn't have to take long.\n\n1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:36.840\n That's not how evolution works.\n\n1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.640\n That's not an answer to the question.\n\n1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:41.680\n It just shows you can reconstruct the steps\n\n1:23:41.680 --> 1:23:44.600\n and you can work out roughly how it can work.\n\n1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:48.280\n So it's not that big a deal to evolve an eye,\n\n1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:51.960\n but once you have one, then there's nowhere to hide.\n\n1:23:51.960 --> 1:23:55.120\n And again, we're back to predator prey relationships.\n\n1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:56.360\n We're back to all the benefits\n\n1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:58.320\n that being able to see brings you.\n\n1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:00.760\n And if you think philosophically what bats are doing\n\n1:24:00.760 --> 1:24:04.240\n with eco location and so on, I have no idea,\n\n1:24:04.240 --> 1:24:06.440\n but I suspect that they form an image of the world\n\n1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:07.960\n in pretty much the same way that we do.\n\n1:24:07.960 --> 1:24:10.160\n It's just a matter of mental reconstruction.\n\n1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:11.880\n So I suppose the other thing about sight,\n\n1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:16.880\n there are single celled organisms that have got a lens\n\n1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:21.600\n and a retina and a cornea and so on.\n\n1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:24.840\n Basically they've got a camera type eye in a single cell.\n\n1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:26.000\n They don't have a brain.\n\n1:24:27.440 --> 1:24:29.680\n What they understand about their world\n\n1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:32.680\n is impossible to say, but they're capable of coming up\n\n1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:34.960\n with the same structures to do so.\n\n1:24:34.960 --> 1:24:39.160\n So I suppose then is that once you've got things like eyes,\n\n1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.100\n then you have a big driving pressure\n\n1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:42.440\n on the central nervous system\n\n1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.480\n to figure out what it all means.\n\n1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:45.720\n And then we come around to your other point\n\n1:24:45.720 --> 1:24:48.000\n about manipulation, sensory input, and so on\n\n1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.800\n about now you have a huge requirement\n\n1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:55.080\n to understand what your environment is and what it means\n\n1:24:55.080 --> 1:24:57.120\n and how it reacts and how you should run away\n\n1:24:57.120 --> 1:24:59.200\n and where you should stay put.\n\n1:24:59.200 --> 1:25:00.480\n Actually on that point, let me,\n\n1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.800\n I don't know if you know the work of Donald Hoffman,\n\n1:25:03.800 --> 1:25:08.800\n who uses the argument, the mechanism of evolution\n\n1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:14.800\n to say that there's not necessarily\n\n1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:19.800\n a strong evolutionary value to seeing the world as it is.\n\n1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.880\n So objective reality, that our perception actually\n\n1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:29.840\n is very different from what's objectively real.\n\n1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:32.240\n We're living inside an illusion\n\n1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:37.240\n and we're basically the entire set of species on earth,\n\n1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:40.200\n I think, I guess, are competing in a space\n\n1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:41.980\n that's an illusion that's distinct from,\n\n1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:45.360\n that's far away from physical reality as it is,\n\n1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:46.280\n as defined by physics.\n\n1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:48.720\n I'm not sure it's an illusion so much as a bubble.\n\n1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:50.520\n I mean, we have a sensory input,\n\n1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:51.960\n which is a fraction of what we could have\n\n1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:55.280\n a sensory input on, and we interpret it\n\n1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:58.240\n in terms of what's useful for us to know to stay alive.\n\n1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:00.720\n So yes, it's an illusion in that sense,\n\n1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:03.640\n but the tree is physically there.\n\n1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:06.320\n And if you walk into that tree, you know,\n\n1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:08.240\n that there is, it's not purely a delusion,\n\n1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:10.360\n there's some physical reality to it.\n\n1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:15.140\n So it's a sensory slice into reality as it is,\n\n1:26:15.140 --> 1:26:17.160\n but because it's just a slice,\n\n1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:18.840\n you're missing a big picture.\n\n1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:21.400\n But he says that that slice doesn't necessarily\n\n1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:23.080\n need to be a slice.\n\n1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:25.800\n It could be a complete fabrication\n\n1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:28.440\n that's just consistent amongst the species,\n\n1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.640\n which is an interesting, or at least it's a humbling\n\n1:26:32.780 --> 1:26:37.160\n realization that our perception is limited\n\n1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:40.520\n and our cognitive abilities are limited.\n\n1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:44.920\n And at least to me, it's argument from evolution,\n\n1:26:44.920 --> 1:26:49.380\n I don't know how much, how strong that is as an argument,\n\n1:26:49.380 --> 1:26:54.380\n but I do think that life can exist in the mind.\n\n1:26:54.380 --> 1:26:59.380\n In the same way that you can do a virtual reality video game\n\n1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:02.300\n and you can have a vibrant life inside that place\n\n1:27:02.300 --> 1:27:05.860\n and that place is not real in some sense,\n\n1:27:05.860 --> 1:27:07.180\n but you could still have a vibrant,\n\n1:27:07.180 --> 1:27:08.860\n all the same forces of evolution,\n\n1:27:08.860 --> 1:27:12.860\n all the same competition, the dynamics of between humans\n\n1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:17.120\n you can have, but I don't know if,\n\n1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:21.980\n I don't know if there's evidence for that being\n\n1:27:21.980 --> 1:27:23.660\n the thing that happened on earth.\n\n1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:25.100\n It seems that earth.\n\n1:27:25.100 --> 1:27:27.100\n I think in either environment, I wouldn't deny\n\n1:27:27.100 --> 1:27:29.820\n that you could have exactly the world that you talk about\n\n1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:31.860\n and it would be very difficult to,\n\n1:27:33.420 --> 1:27:36.540\n the idea in matrix movies and so on\n\n1:27:36.540 --> 1:27:40.300\n that the whole world is completely a construction\n\n1:27:42.180 --> 1:27:43.900\n and we're fundamentally deluded.\n\n1:27:43.900 --> 1:27:47.260\n It's difficult to say that's impossible or couldn't happen\n\n1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:51.160\n or, and certainly we construct in our minds\n\n1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:53.220\n what the outside world is, but we do it on input\n\n1:27:53.220 --> 1:27:56.820\n and that input, I would hesitate to say it's not real\n\n1:27:57.780 --> 1:28:00.340\n because it's precisely how we do understand the world.\n\n1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:04.100\n We have eyes, but if you keep someone in,\n\n1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:06.060\n apparently this kind of thing happens,\n\n1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:08.560\n someone kept in a dark room for five years\n\n1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.940\n or something like that, they never see properly again\n\n1:28:10.940 --> 1:28:15.220\n because the neural wiring that underpins\n\n1:28:15.220 --> 1:28:18.840\n how we interpret vision never developed.\n\n1:28:18.840 --> 1:28:21.260\n You need, when you watch a child develop,\n\n1:28:21.260 --> 1:28:23.780\n it walks into a table, it bangs his head on the table\n\n1:28:23.780 --> 1:28:28.100\n and it hurts and now you've got two inputs.\n\n1:28:28.100 --> 1:28:30.060\n You've got one pain from this sharp edge\n\n1:28:30.060 --> 1:28:32.300\n and number two, you probably, you've touched it\n\n1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:33.900\n and realized it's there, it's a sharp edge\n\n1:28:33.900 --> 1:28:34.940\n and you've got the visual input\n\n1:28:34.940 --> 1:28:36.500\n and you put the three things together and think,\n\n1:28:36.500 --> 1:28:38.360\n I don't wanna walk into a table again.\n\n1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:42.420\n So you're learning and it's a limited reality,\n\n1:28:42.420 --> 1:28:44.260\n but it's a true reality and if you don't learn\n\n1:28:44.260 --> 1:28:45.740\n that properly, then you will get eaten,\n\n1:28:45.740 --> 1:28:48.740\n you will get hit by a bus, you will not survive.\n\n1:28:48.740 --> 1:28:52.160\n And same, if you're in some kind of,\n\n1:28:53.420 --> 1:28:55.940\n let's say, computer construction of reality,\n\n1:28:55.940 --> 1:28:59.180\n I'm not in my ground here, but if you construct the laws\n\n1:28:59.180 --> 1:29:03.620\n that this is what reality is inside this,\n\n1:29:03.620 --> 1:29:05.180\n then you play by those laws.\n\n1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:07.580\n Yeah, I mean, as long as the laws are consistent.\n\n1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:09.620\n So just like you said in the lab,\n\n1:29:09.620 --> 1:29:12.540\n the interesting thing about the simulation question,\n\n1:29:12.540 --> 1:29:15.480\n yes, it's hard to know if we're living inside a simulation,\n\n1:29:15.480 --> 1:29:18.580\n but also, yes, it's possible to do these kinds\n\n1:29:18.580 --> 1:29:21.700\n of experiments in the lab now more and more.\n\n1:29:21.700 --> 1:29:23.740\n To me, the interesting question is,\n\n1:29:23.740 --> 1:29:28.140\n how realistic does a virtual reality game need to be\n\n1:29:28.140 --> 1:29:30.620\n for us to not be able to tell the difference?\n\n1:29:30.620 --> 1:29:33.300\n A more interesting question to me is,\n\n1:29:33.300 --> 1:29:38.300\n how realistic or interesting\n\n1:29:38.460 --> 1:29:40.660\n does a virtual reality world need to be\n\n1:29:40.660 --> 1:29:43.460\n in order for us to want to stay there forever\n\n1:29:43.460 --> 1:29:47.900\n or much longer than physical reality, prefer that place?\n\n1:29:47.900 --> 1:29:52.140\n And also prefer it not as we prefer hard drugs,\n\n1:29:52.140 --> 1:29:55.100\n but prefer it in a deep, meaningful way\n\n1:29:55.100 --> 1:29:57.820\n in the way we enjoy life.\n\n1:29:57.820 --> 1:30:00.460\n I mean, I suppose the issue with the matrix,\n\n1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:05.020\n I imagine that it's possible to dilute the mind sufficiently\n\n1:30:05.020 --> 1:30:07.000\n that you genuinely, in that way,\n\n1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:10.780\n do think that you are interacting with the real world\n\n1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:12.980\n when in fact the whole thing's a simulation.\n\n1:30:14.340 --> 1:30:17.260\n How good does a simulation need to be to be able to do that?\n\n1:30:17.260 --> 1:30:21.380\n Well, it needs to convince you\n\n1:30:21.380 --> 1:30:24.140\n that all your sensory input is correct and accurate\n\n1:30:24.140 --> 1:30:26.620\n and joins up and makes sense.\n\n1:30:26.620 --> 1:30:28.380\n Now, that sensory input is not something\n\n1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:29.740\n that we're born with.\n\n1:30:29.740 --> 1:30:31.660\n We're born with a sense of touch.\n\n1:30:31.660 --> 1:30:33.020\n We're born with eyes and so on,\n\n1:30:33.020 --> 1:30:34.120\n but we don't know how to use them.\n\n1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.740\n We don't know what to make of them.\n\n1:30:35.740 --> 1:30:37.460\n We go around, we bump into trees.\n\n1:30:37.460 --> 1:30:38.660\n We cry a lot.\n\n1:30:38.660 --> 1:30:39.620\n We're in pain a lot.\n\n1:30:39.620 --> 1:30:43.080\n We're basically booting up the system\n\n1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:45.340\n so that it can make head or tail\n\n1:30:45.340 --> 1:30:47.580\n of the sensory input that it's getting.\n\n1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:49.980\n And that sensory input's not just a one way flux of things.\n\n1:30:49.980 --> 1:30:51.580\n It's also, you have to walk into things.\n\n1:30:51.580 --> 1:30:52.420\n You have to hear things.\n\n1:30:52.420 --> 1:30:53.700\n You have to put it together.\n\n1:30:53.700 --> 1:30:58.140\n Now, if you've got just babies in the matrix\n\n1:30:58.140 --> 1:30:59.940\n who are slotted into this,\n\n1:30:59.940 --> 1:31:02.540\n I don't think they have that kind of sensory input.\n\n1:31:02.540 --> 1:31:03.740\n I don't think they would have any way\n\n1:31:03.740 --> 1:31:08.420\n to make sense of New York as a world that they're part of.\n\n1:31:08.420 --> 1:31:10.740\n The brain is just not developed in that way.\n\n1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:12.380\n Well, I can't make sense of New York\n\n1:31:12.380 --> 1:31:13.920\n in this physical reality either.\n\n1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:16.300\n But yeah, I mean, but you said pain\n\n1:31:16.300 --> 1:31:17.840\n and the walking into things.\n\n1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:19.760\n Well, you can create a pain signal.\n\n1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:21.900\n And as long as it's consistent,\n\n1:31:21.900 --> 1:31:23.860\n that certain things result in pain,\n\n1:31:23.860 --> 1:31:25.860\n you can start to construct a reality.\n\n1:31:25.860 --> 1:31:28.460\n There's some, maybe you disagree with this,\n\n1:31:28.460 --> 1:31:33.300\n but I think we are born almost with a desire\n\n1:31:33.300 --> 1:31:35.820\n to be convinced by our reality,\n\n1:31:35.820 --> 1:31:38.860\n like a desire to make sense of our reality.\n\n1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:40.240\n Oh, I'm sure we are, yes.\n\n1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:41.140\n So there's an imperative.\n\n1:31:41.140 --> 1:31:43.980\n So whatever that reality is given to us,\n\n1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:46.580\n like the table hurts, fire is hot.\n\n1:31:46.580 --> 1:31:49.900\n I think we wanna be diluted\n\n1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.100\n in the sense that we want to make a simple,\n\n1:31:53.100 --> 1:31:56.440\n like Einstein's simple theory of the thing around us.\n\n1:31:56.440 --> 1:31:58.020\n We want that simplicity.\n\n1:31:58.020 --> 1:32:02.220\n And so maybe the hunger for the simplicity\n\n1:32:02.220 --> 1:32:03.860\n is the thing that could be used\n\n1:32:03.860 --> 1:32:07.820\n to construct a pretty dumb simulation that tricks us.\n\n1:32:07.820 --> 1:32:09.100\n So maybe tricking humans\n\n1:32:09.100 --> 1:32:11.500\n doesn't require building a universe.\n\n1:32:11.500 --> 1:32:12.580\n No, I don't.\n\n1:32:12.580 --> 1:32:14.500\n I mean, this is not what I work on,\n\n1:32:14.500 --> 1:32:15.900\n so I don't know how close to it we are.\n\n1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:16.740\n I don't think anyone works on it.\n\n1:32:16.740 --> 1:32:18.740\n But I agree with you that, yeah,\n\n1:32:18.740 --> 1:32:21.980\n I'm not sure that it's a morally justifiable thing to do,\n\n1:32:21.980 --> 1:32:24.820\n but is it possible in principle?\n\n1:32:26.500 --> 1:32:28.420\n I think it would be very difficult,\n\n1:32:28.420 --> 1:32:31.540\n but I don't see why in principle it wouldn't be possible.\n\n1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:35.860\n And I agree with you that we try to understand the world.\n\n1:32:35.860 --> 1:32:38.060\n We try to integrate the sensory inputs that we have,\n\n1:32:38.060 --> 1:32:40.180\n and we try to come up with a hypothesis\n\n1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:41.980\n that explains what's going on.\n\n1:32:41.980 --> 1:32:46.260\n I think though that we have huge input\n\n1:32:46.260 --> 1:32:49.140\n from the social context that we're in.\n\n1:32:49.140 --> 1:32:50.500\n We don't do it by ourselves.\n\n1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:53.500\n We don't kind of blunder around in a universe by ourself\n\n1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:55.980\n and understand the whole thing.\n\n1:32:55.980 --> 1:32:58.060\n We're told by the people around us\n\n1:32:58.060 --> 1:32:59.420\n what things are and what they do,\n\n1:32:59.420 --> 1:33:01.680\n and language is coming in here and so on.\n\n1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:05.300\n So it would have to be an extremely impressive simulation\n\n1:33:05.300 --> 1:33:08.240\n to simulate all of that.\n\n1:33:08.240 --> 1:33:10.340\n Yeah, simulate all of that,\n\n1:33:10.340 --> 1:33:12.100\n including the social construct,\n\n1:33:12.100 --> 1:33:15.940\n the spread of ideas and the exchange of ideas.\n\n1:33:15.940 --> 1:33:16.780\n I don't know.\n\n1:33:16.780 --> 1:33:18.660\n But those questions are really important to understand\n\n1:33:18.660 --> 1:33:22.060\n as we become more and more digital creatures.\n\n1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:23.780\n It seems like the next step of evolution\n\n1:33:23.780 --> 1:33:28.300\n is us becoming all the same mechanisms we've talked about\n\n1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:31.860\n are becoming more and more plugged into the machine.\n\n1:33:31.860 --> 1:33:34.100\n We're becoming cyborgs.\n\n1:33:34.100 --> 1:33:36.660\n And there's an interesting interplay\n\n1:33:36.660 --> 1:33:38.600\n between wires and biology.\n\n1:33:40.420 --> 1:33:43.500\n Zeros and ones and the biological systems.\n\n1:33:43.500 --> 1:33:48.500\n And I don't think we'll have the luxury\n\n1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:51.180\n to see humans as disjoint from the technology\n\n1:33:51.180 --> 1:33:53.500\n we've created for much longer.\n\n1:33:53.500 --> 1:33:55.500\n We are an organism that's.\n\n1:33:56.540 --> 1:34:00.300\n Yeah, I mean, I agree with you.\n\n1:34:00.300 --> 1:34:05.300\n But we come really with this to consciousness.\n\n1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:06.940\n Yes.\n\n1:34:06.940 --> 1:34:08.180\n And is there a distinction there?\n\n1:34:08.180 --> 1:34:09.620\n Because what you're saying,\n\n1:34:09.620 --> 1:34:12.020\n the natural end point says we are indistinguishable,\n\n1:34:12.020 --> 1:34:17.020\n that if you are capable of building an AI,\n\n1:34:17.100 --> 1:34:19.700\n which is sufficiently close and similar\n\n1:34:19.700 --> 1:34:20.660\n that we merge with it,\n\n1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:23.620\n then to all intents and purposes,\n\n1:34:23.620 --> 1:34:26.220\n that AI is conscious as we know it.\n\n1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:31.220\n And I don't have a strong view, but I have a view.\n\n1:34:35.100 --> 1:34:37.780\n And I wrote about it in the epilogue to my last book,\n\n1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:39.580\n because 10 years ago,\n\n1:34:39.580 --> 1:34:44.420\n I wrote a chapter in a book called Life Ascending\n\n1:34:44.420 --> 1:34:45.900\n about consciousness.\n\n1:34:45.900 --> 1:34:47.380\n And the subtitle of Life Ascending\n\n1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:49.940\n was The 10 Great Inventions of Evolution.\n\n1:34:49.940 --> 1:34:51.340\n And I couldn't possibly write a book\n\n1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:54.540\n with a subtitle like that that did not include consciousness.\n\n1:34:54.540 --> 1:34:56.820\n And specifically consciousness\n\n1:34:56.820 --> 1:34:59.420\n as one of the great inventions.\n\n1:34:59.420 --> 1:35:02.540\n And it was in part because I was just curious to know more\n\n1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:04.380\n and I read more for that chapter.\n\n1:35:04.380 --> 1:35:06.340\n I never worked on it, but I've always,\n\n1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:09.220\n how can anyone not be interested in the question?\n\n1:35:09.220 --> 1:35:13.220\n And I was left with the feeling that A, nobody knows,\n\n1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:18.220\n and B, there are two main schools of thought out there\n\n1:35:18.260 --> 1:35:21.180\n with a big kind of skew in distribution.\n\n1:35:21.180 --> 1:35:23.780\n One of them says, oh, it's a property of matter.\n\n1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:26.300\n It's an unknown law of physics.\n\n1:35:26.300 --> 1:35:28.180\n Panpsychism, everything is conscious.\n\n1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:29.100\n The sun is conscious.\n\n1:35:29.100 --> 1:35:31.380\n It's just a matter of, or a rock is conscious.\n\n1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:33.700\n It's just a matter of how much.\n\n1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:36.460\n And I find that very unpersuasive.\n\n1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:37.740\n I can't say that it's wrong.\n\n1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:41.380\n It's just that I think we somehow can tell the difference\n\n1:35:41.380 --> 1:35:44.020\n between something that's living and something that's not.\n\n1:35:45.060 --> 1:35:48.820\n And then the other end is it's an emergent property\n\n1:35:48.820 --> 1:35:51.340\n of a very complex central nervous system.\n\n1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:56.340\n And I never quite understand what people mean\n\n1:35:56.340 --> 1:35:57.820\n by words like emergence.\n\n1:35:57.820 --> 1:35:59.580\n I mean, there are genuine examples,\n\n1:35:59.580 --> 1:36:03.740\n but I think we very often tend to use it\n\n1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:06.900\n to plaster over ignorance.\n\n1:36:08.020 --> 1:36:10.580\n As a biochemist, the question for me then was,\n\n1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:15.580\n okay, it's a concoction of a central nervous system.\n\n1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:20.260\n A depolarizing neuron gives rise to a feeling,\n\n1:36:20.260 --> 1:36:24.660\n to a feeling of pain, or to a feeling of love,\n\n1:36:24.660 --> 1:36:27.700\n or anger, or whatever it may be.\n\n1:36:27.700 --> 1:36:30.580\n So what is then a feeling in biophysical terms\n\n1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:31.820\n in the central nervous system?\n\n1:36:31.820 --> 1:36:34.780\n Which bit of the wiring gives rise to,\n\n1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:38.060\n and I've never seen anyone answer that question\n\n1:36:38.060 --> 1:36:41.220\n in a way that makes sense to me.\n\n1:36:41.220 --> 1:36:43.700\n And that's an important question to answer.\n\n1:36:43.700 --> 1:36:45.380\n I think if we want to understand consciousness,\n\n1:36:45.380 --> 1:36:47.180\n that's the only question to answer.\n\n1:36:47.180 --> 1:36:51.780\n Because certainly an AI is capable of out thinking,\n\n1:36:51.780 --> 1:36:53.460\n and it's only a matter of time.\n\n1:36:53.460 --> 1:36:54.940\n Maybe it's already happened.\n\n1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:58.260\n In terms of just information processing\n\n1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:00.020\n and computational skill,\n\n1:37:00.020 --> 1:37:04.220\n I don't think we have any problem in designing a mind\n\n1:37:04.220 --> 1:37:07.300\n which is at least the equal of the human mind.\n\n1:37:07.300 --> 1:37:11.180\n But in terms of what we value the most as humans,\n\n1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:13.300\n which is to say our feelings, our emotions,\n\n1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:18.300\n our sense of what the world is in a very personal way,\n\n1:37:20.140 --> 1:37:23.540\n that I think means as much or more to people\n\n1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:24.900\n than their information processing.\n\n1:37:24.900 --> 1:37:28.700\n And that's where I don't think that AI necessarily\n\n1:37:28.700 --> 1:37:31.460\n will become conscious, because I think\n\n1:37:31.460 --> 1:37:33.060\n it's the property of life.\n\n1:37:33.060 --> 1:37:34.220\n Well, let's talk about it more.\n\n1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:36.820\n You're an incredible writer, one of my favorite writers.\n\n1:37:36.820 --> 1:37:40.420\n So let me read from your latest book, Transformers,\n\n1:37:40.420 --> 1:37:42.760\n what you write about consciousness.\n\n1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:46.180\n I think therefore I am, said Descartes,\n\n1:37:46.180 --> 1:37:49.300\n is one of the most celebrated lines ever written.\n\n1:37:49.300 --> 1:37:51.580\n But what am I exactly?\n\n1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:54.660\n An artificial intelligence can think too, by definition,\n\n1:37:54.660 --> 1:37:58.140\n and therefore is, yet few of us could agree\n\n1:37:58.140 --> 1:38:00.760\n whether AI is capable in principle\n\n1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:03.180\n of anything resembling human emotions,\n\n1:38:03.180 --> 1:38:08.180\n of love or hate, fear and joy, of spiritual yearnings,\n\n1:38:08.500 --> 1:38:10.660\n for oneness or oblivion,\n\n1:38:10.660 --> 1:38:14.220\n or corporeal pangs of thirst and hunger.\n\n1:38:14.220 --> 1:38:18.100\n The problem is we don't know what emotions are,\n\n1:38:18.100 --> 1:38:19.380\n as you were saying.\n\n1:38:19.380 --> 1:38:21.780\n What is the feeling in physical terms?\n\n1:38:21.780 --> 1:38:23.800\n How does a discharging neuron give rise\n\n1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:25.680\n to a feeling of anything at all?\n\n1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:28.620\n This is the hard problem of consciousness,\n\n1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:31.180\n the seeming duality of mind and matter,\n\n1:38:31.180 --> 1:38:34.260\n the physical makeup of our innermost self.\n\n1:38:34.260 --> 1:38:35.640\n We can understand in principle\n\n1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:38.780\n how an extremely sophisticated parallel processing system\n\n1:38:38.780 --> 1:38:41.500\n could be capable of wondrous feats of intelligence,\n\n1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.140\n but we can't answer in principle\n\n1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:46.200\n whether such a supreme intelligence\n\n1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:49.160\n would experience joy or melancholy.\n\n1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:51.180\n What is the quantum of solace?\n\n1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:56.060\n I, speaking to the question of emergence,\n\n1:38:57.060 --> 1:38:59.180\n you know, there's just technical,\n\n1:39:00.900 --> 1:39:03.820\n there's an excellent paper on this recently\n\n1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:08.140\n about this kind of phase transition,\n\n1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:10.800\n emergence of performance in neural networks\n\n1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:14.980\n on the problem of NLP, natural language processing.\n\n1:39:14.980 --> 1:39:19.460\n So language models, there seems to be this question of size.\n\n1:39:19.460 --> 1:39:23.940\n At some point, there is a phase transition\n\n1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:25.940\n as you grow the size of the neural network.\n\n1:39:25.940 --> 1:39:27.300\n So the question is,\n\n1:39:27.300 --> 1:39:29.980\n that's sort of somewhat of a technical question\n\n1:39:29.980 --> 1:39:32.060\n that you can philosophize over.\n\n1:39:32.060 --> 1:39:33.300\n The technical question is,\n\n1:39:33.300 --> 1:39:35.740\n is there a size of a neural network\n\n1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:39.140\n that starts to be able to form the kind of representations\n\n1:39:39.140 --> 1:39:40.740\n that can capture a language,\n\n1:39:40.740 --> 1:39:44.740\n and therefore be able to, not just language,\n\n1:39:44.740 --> 1:39:47.120\n but linguistically capture knowledge\n\n1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:50.940\n that's sufficient to solve a lot of problems in language,\n\n1:39:50.940 --> 1:39:52.580\n like be able to have a conversation.\n\n1:39:52.580 --> 1:39:55.780\n And there seems to be not a gradual increase,\n\n1:39:55.780 --> 1:39:57.100\n but a phase transition.\n\n1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:01.200\n And they're trying to construct the science of where that is,\n\n1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.620\n like what is a good size of a neural network,\n\n1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:05.900\n and why does such a phase transition happen?\n\n1:40:05.900 --> 1:40:08.660\n Anyway, that sort of points to emergence,\n\n1:40:08.660 --> 1:40:13.660\n that there could be stages where a thing goes\n\n1:40:15.100 --> 1:40:18.940\n from being, oh, you're very intelligent toaster,\n\n1:40:20.180 --> 1:40:25.020\n to a toaster that's feeling sad today and turns away\n\n1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:29.180\n and looks out the window, sighing,\n\n1:40:29.180 --> 1:40:30.660\n having an existential crisis.\n\n1:40:30.660 --> 1:40:33.700\n Thinking of Marvin, the paranoid android.\n\n1:40:33.700 --> 1:40:38.260\n Marvin is simplistic because Marvin is just cranky.\n\n1:40:38.260 --> 1:40:39.100\n Yes.\n\n1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:41.580\n So easily programmed.\n\n1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:45.220\n Yeah, easily programmed, nonstop existential crisis.\n\n1:40:45.220 --> 1:40:47.300\n You're almost basically, what is it?\n\n1:40:47.300 --> 1:40:48.820\n Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky,\n\n1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:53.040\n like just constantly complaining about life.\n\n1:40:53.040 --> 1:40:57.140\n No, they're capturing the full rollercoaster\n\n1:40:57.140 --> 1:41:00.140\n of human emotion, the excitement, the bliss,\n\n1:41:00.140 --> 1:41:03.940\n the connection, the empathy and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:41:03.940 --> 1:41:08.940\n And then the selfishness, the anger, the depression,\n\n1:41:09.100 --> 1:41:09.940\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:11.860\n They're capturing all of that\n\n1:41:11.860 --> 1:41:14.420\n and be able to experience it deeply.\n\n1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:16.580\n Like it's the most important thing\n\n1:41:16.580 --> 1:41:18.540\n you could possibly experience today.\n\n1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:21.300\n The highest highs, the lowest lows, this is it.\n\n1:41:21.300 --> 1:41:22.740\n My life will be over.\n\n1:41:24.460 --> 1:41:26.740\n I cannot possibly go on that feeling.\n\n1:41:26.740 --> 1:41:30.580\n And then like after a nap, you're feeling amazing.\n\n1:41:30.580 --> 1:41:33.620\n That might be something that emerges.\n\n1:41:33.620 --> 1:41:38.620\n So why would a nap make an AI being feel better?\n\n1:41:42.580 --> 1:41:45.220\n First of all, we don't know that for a human either, right?\n\n1:41:45.220 --> 1:41:47.620\n But we do know that that's actually true\n\n1:41:47.620 --> 1:41:48.980\n for many people much of the time.\n\n1:41:48.980 --> 1:41:50.820\n You may be utterly depressed and you have a nap\n\n1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:53.460\n and you do in fact feel better, so.\n\n1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:55.660\n Oh, you are actually asking the technical question there,\n\n1:41:55.660 --> 1:41:57.940\n is there, so that's a very,\n\n1:41:57.940 --> 1:41:59.980\n there's a biological answer to that.\n\n1:41:59.980 --> 1:42:01.980\n And so the question is whether AI needs to have\n\n1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:04.860\n the same kind of attachments to its body,\n\n1:42:04.860 --> 1:42:07.580\n bodily function and preservation\n\n1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:11.300\n of the brain's successful function,\n\n1:42:13.180 --> 1:42:17.060\n self preservation essentially in some deep biological sense.\n\n1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:19.940\n I mean, to my mind, it comes back round\n\n1:42:19.940 --> 1:42:21.660\n to the problem we were talking about before\n\n1:42:21.660 --> 1:42:24.100\n about simulations and sensory input\n\n1:42:24.100 --> 1:42:28.580\n and learning what all of this stuff means\n\n1:42:28.580 --> 1:42:29.740\n and life and death,\n\n1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:35.100\n that biology unlike society has a death penalty\n\n1:42:35.100 --> 1:42:37.820\n over everything and natural selection works\n\n1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:38.980\n on that death penalty.\n\n1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:43.980\n That if you make this decision wrongly, you die.\n\n1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:50.780\n And the next generation is represented by beings\n\n1:42:50.780 --> 1:42:54.420\n that made a slightly different decision on balance.\n\n1:42:56.380 --> 1:42:58.620\n And that is something that's intrinsically\n\n1:43:00.980 --> 1:43:04.260\n difficult to simulate in all this richness, I would say.\n\n1:43:06.020 --> 1:43:07.380\n So what is?\n\n1:43:09.060 --> 1:43:11.100\n Death in all its richness.\n\n1:43:11.100 --> 1:43:12.060\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:12.060 --> 1:43:16.580\n Our relationship with death or the whole of it.\n\n1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:20.140\n So which when you say richness, of course,\n\n1:43:20.140 --> 1:43:21.380\n there's a lot in that.\n\n1:43:21.380 --> 1:43:22.220\n Yeah.\n\n1:43:22.220 --> 1:43:23.860\n Which is hard to simulate.\n\n1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.660\n What's part of the richness that's hard to simulate?\n\n1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:31.020\n I suppose the complexity of the environment\n\n1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:33.340\n and your position in that or the position\n\n1:43:33.340 --> 1:43:35.460\n of an organism in that environment,\n\n1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:37.540\n in the full richness of that environment\n\n1:43:37.540 --> 1:43:40.620\n over its entire life, over multiple generations\n\n1:43:40.620 --> 1:43:44.220\n with changes in gene sequence over those generations.\n\n1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:46.860\n So slight changes in the makeup of those individuals\n\n1:43:46.860 --> 1:43:48.300\n over generations.\n\n1:43:48.300 --> 1:43:51.340\n But if you take it back to the level of single cells,\n\n1:43:52.460 --> 1:43:57.460\n which I do in the book and ask how does a single cell\n\n1:43:59.340 --> 1:44:02.340\n in effect know it exists as a unit, as an entity?\n\n1:44:02.340 --> 1:44:03.980\n I mean, no, in inverted commas,\n\n1:44:03.980 --> 1:44:07.100\n obviously it doesn't know anything,\n\n1:44:07.100 --> 1:44:09.060\n but it acts as a unit and it acts\n\n1:44:09.060 --> 1:44:13.740\n with astonishing precision as a unit.\n\n1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:17.300\n And I had suggested that that's linked\n\n1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:19.860\n to the electrical fields on the membranes themselves\n\n1:44:19.860 --> 1:44:21.900\n and that they give some indication\n\n1:44:21.900 --> 1:44:24.340\n of how am I doing in relation to my environment\n\n1:44:24.340 --> 1:44:27.180\n as a kind of real time feedback on the world.\n\n1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:31.020\n And this is something physical,\n\n1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:34.940\n which can be selected over generations\n\n1:44:34.940 --> 1:44:37.460\n that if you get this wrong,\n\n1:44:39.180 --> 1:44:42.300\n it's linked with this set of circumstances\n\n1:44:42.300 --> 1:44:45.500\n that I've just, as an individual,\n\n1:44:45.500 --> 1:44:47.820\n I have a moment of blind panic and run\n\n1:44:49.140 --> 1:44:50.620\n as a bacterium or something.\n\n1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:54.180\n You have some electrical discharge that says blind panic\n\n1:44:54.180 --> 1:44:56.580\n and it runs whatever it may be.\n\n1:44:56.580 --> 1:44:59.820\n And you associate over generations, multiple generations\n\n1:44:59.820 --> 1:45:03.660\n that this electrical phase that I'm in now\n\n1:45:03.660 --> 1:45:07.100\n is associated with a response like that.\n\n1:45:07.100 --> 1:45:09.860\n And it's easy to see how feelings come in\n\n1:45:09.860 --> 1:45:17.700\n through the back door almost with that kind of giving real time\n\n1:45:17.700 --> 1:45:19.500\n feedback on your position in the world\n\n1:45:19.500 --> 1:45:22.060\n in relation to how am I doing.\n\n1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:23.900\n And then you complexify the system\n\n1:45:23.900 --> 1:45:27.780\n and yes, I have no problem with phase transition.\n\n1:45:27.780 --> 1:45:36.420\n And can all of this be done purely by the language,\n\n1:45:36.420 --> 1:45:41.780\n by the issues with how the system understands itself?\n\n1:45:42.620 --> 1:45:44.220\n Maybe it can, I honestly don't know.\n\n1:45:45.260 --> 1:45:47.580\n But the philosophers for a long time\n\n1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:49.700\n have talked about the possibility\n\n1:45:49.700 --> 1:45:52.980\n that you can have a zombie intelligence\n\n1:45:54.100 --> 1:45:55.660\n and that there are no feelings there,\n\n1:45:55.660 --> 1:45:57.500\n but everything else is the same.\n\n1:45:59.460 --> 1:46:01.460\n I mean, I have to throw this back to you really.\n\n1:46:01.460 --> 1:46:03.980\n How do you deal with the zombie intelligence?\n\n1:46:03.980 --> 1:46:08.620\n So first of all, I can see that from a biologist perspective,\n\n1:46:08.620 --> 1:46:10.740\n you think of all the complexities\n\n1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:12.860\n that led up to the human being.\n\n1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:15.780\n The entirety of the history of four billion years\n\n1:46:15.780 --> 1:46:18.860\n that in some deep sense integrated the human being\n\n1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:20.180\n into this environment.\n\n1:46:20.180 --> 1:46:25.020\n And that dance of the organism and the environment,\n\n1:46:25.020 --> 1:46:27.380\n you could see how emotions arise from that.\n\n1:46:27.380 --> 1:46:29.740\n And then emotions are deeply connected\n\n1:46:29.740 --> 1:46:32.020\n and creating a human experience.\n\n1:46:32.020 --> 1:46:34.180\n And from that, you mix in consciousness\n\n1:46:34.180 --> 1:46:36.340\n and the full mess of it, yeah.\n\n1:46:37.260 --> 1:46:40.900\n But from a perspective of an intelligent organism\n\n1:46:40.900 --> 1:46:45.220\n that's already here, like a baby that learns,\n\n1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:49.420\n it doesn't need to learn how to be a collection of cells\n\n1:46:49.420 --> 1:46:52.260\n or how to do all the things it needs to do.\n\n1:46:52.260 --> 1:46:55.340\n The basic function of a baby as it learns\n\n1:46:55.340 --> 1:46:57.380\n is to interact with its environment,\n\n1:46:57.380 --> 1:46:58.620\n to learn from its environment,\n\n1:46:58.620 --> 1:47:01.820\n to learn how to fit in to the social society,\n\n1:47:01.820 --> 1:47:03.180\n to like...\n\n1:47:03.180 --> 1:47:05.940\n And the basic response of the baby\n\n1:47:05.940 --> 1:47:07.100\n is to cry a lot of the time.\n\n1:47:07.100 --> 1:47:12.100\n To cry, well, to convince the humans to protect it\n\n1:47:12.540 --> 1:47:14.940\n or to discipline it, to teach it.\n\n1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:18.780\n I mean, we've developed a bunch of different tricks,\n\n1:47:18.780 --> 1:47:22.100\n how to get our parents to take care of us,\n\n1:47:22.100 --> 1:47:24.860\n to educate us, to teach us about the world.\n\n1:47:24.860 --> 1:47:27.900\n Also, we've constructed the world in such a way\n\n1:47:27.900 --> 1:47:30.380\n that it's safe enough for us to survive in\n\n1:47:30.380 --> 1:47:32.780\n and yet dangerous enough for learning the valuable lessons.\n\n1:47:32.780 --> 1:47:35.580\n Like the tables are still hard with corners,\n\n1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:36.820\n so it can still run into them.\n\n1:47:36.820 --> 1:47:38.740\n It hurts like how...\n\n1:47:38.740 --> 1:47:41.660\n So AI needs to solve that problem,\n\n1:47:41.660 --> 1:47:43.060\n not the problem of constructing\n\n1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:46.260\n this super complex organism that leads up...\n\n1:47:47.980 --> 1:47:49.420\n To run the whole...\n\n1:47:51.660 --> 1:47:53.940\n To make an apple pie, to build the whole universe,\n\n1:47:53.940 --> 1:47:55.900\n you need to build a whole universe.\n\n1:47:55.900 --> 1:48:00.540\n I think the zombie question is something\n\n1:48:01.780 --> 1:48:04.020\n I would leave to the philosophers.\n\n1:48:04.020 --> 1:48:06.220\n Because...\n\n1:48:08.260 --> 1:48:11.180\n And I will also leave to them the definition of love\n\n1:48:11.180 --> 1:48:14.900\n and what happens between two human beings\n\n1:48:14.900 --> 1:48:18.540\n when there's a magic that just grabs them.\n\n1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:20.700\n Like nothing else matters in the world\n\n1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:22.980\n and somehow you've been searching for this feeling,\n\n1:48:22.980 --> 1:48:25.260\n this moment, this person your whole life.\n\n1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:29.540\n That feeling, the philosophers can have a lot of fun\n\n1:48:29.540 --> 1:48:32.820\n with that one and also say that that's just...\n\n1:48:32.820 --> 1:48:34.700\n You can have a biological explanation,\n\n1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:35.740\n you can have all kinds of...\n\n1:48:35.740 --> 1:48:38.300\n It's all fake, it's actually...\n\n1:48:38.300 --> 1:48:40.700\n Ayn Rand will say it's all selfish.\n\n1:48:40.700 --> 1:48:42.420\n There's a lot of different interpretations.\n\n1:48:42.420 --> 1:48:43.620\n I'll leave it to the philosophers.\n\n1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:48.020\n The point is the feeling sure as hell feels very real.\n\n1:48:48.020 --> 1:48:51.860\n And if my toaster makes me feel\n\n1:48:51.860 --> 1:48:55.740\n like it's the only toaster in the world.\n\n1:48:55.740 --> 1:48:58.420\n And when I leave and I miss the toaster\n\n1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:01.420\n and when I come back, I'm excited to see the toaster\n\n1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:03.980\n and my life is meaningful and joyful\n\n1:49:03.980 --> 1:49:08.100\n and the friends I have around me get a better version of me\n\n1:49:08.100 --> 1:49:09.700\n because that toaster exists.\n\n1:49:10.740 --> 1:49:13.340\n That sure as hell feels like a conscious toaster.\n\n1:49:13.340 --> 1:49:16.020\n Is that psychologically different to having a dog?\n\n1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:16.860\n No.\n\n1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:19.260\n Because I mean most people would dispute\n\n1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:20.540\n whether we can say a dog...\n\n1:49:20.540 --> 1:49:22.220\n I would say a dog is undoubtedly conscious,\n\n1:49:22.220 --> 1:49:24.060\n but some people say it doesn't.\n\n1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:26.260\n But there's degrees of consciousness and so on,\n\n1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:28.780\n but people are definitely much more uncomfortable\n\n1:49:28.780 --> 1:49:32.620\n saying a toaster can be conscious than a dog.\n\n1:49:32.620 --> 1:49:35.060\n And there's still a deep connection.\n\n1:49:35.060 --> 1:49:37.860\n You could say our relationship with the dog\n\n1:49:37.860 --> 1:49:40.100\n has more to do with anthropomorphism.\n\n1:49:40.100 --> 1:49:42.380\n Like we kind of project the human being onto it.\n\n1:49:42.380 --> 1:49:43.220\n Maybe.\n\n1:49:43.220 --> 1:49:45.780\n We can do the same damn thing with a toaster.\n\n1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:48.100\n Yes, but you can look into the dog's eyes\n\n1:49:48.100 --> 1:49:50.460\n and you can see that it's sad,\n\n1:49:50.460 --> 1:49:52.500\n that it's delighted to see you again.\n\n1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:53.900\n I don't have a dog, by the way.\n\n1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:54.740\n It's not that I'm a dog person or a cat person.\n\n1:49:54.740 --> 1:49:56.380\n And dogs are actually incredibly good\n\n1:49:56.380 --> 1:49:59.460\n at using their eyes to do just that.\n\n1:49:59.460 --> 1:50:00.300\n They are.\n\n1:50:00.300 --> 1:50:02.660\n Now, I don't imagine that a dog is remotely\n\n1:50:02.660 --> 1:50:07.060\n as close to being intelligent as an AI intelligence,\n\n1:50:07.060 --> 1:50:09.540\n but it's certainly capable\n\n1:50:09.540 --> 1:50:11.980\n of communicating emotionally with us.\n\n1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:13.860\n But here's what I would venture to say.\n\n1:50:13.860 --> 1:50:17.140\n We tend to think because AI plays chess well\n\n1:50:17.140 --> 1:50:19.700\n and is able to fold proteins now well,\n\n1:50:19.700 --> 1:50:21.020\n that it's intelligent.\n\n1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:23.860\n I would argue that in order to communicate with humans,\n\n1:50:23.860 --> 1:50:25.900\n in order to have emotional intelligence,\n\n1:50:25.900 --> 1:50:27.420\n it actually requires another order\n\n1:50:27.420 --> 1:50:28.900\n of magnitude of intelligence.\n\n1:50:28.900 --> 1:50:32.660\n It's not easy to be flawed.\n\n1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:38.380\n Solving a mathematical puzzle is not the same\n\n1:50:38.380 --> 1:50:42.060\n as the full complexity of human to human interaction.\n\n1:50:42.060 --> 1:50:46.980\n That's actually, we humans just take for granted\n\n1:50:46.980 --> 1:50:49.180\n the things we're really good at.\n\n1:50:49.180 --> 1:50:52.700\n Nonstop, people tell me how shitty people are driving.\n\n1:50:52.700 --> 1:50:56.580\n No, humans are incredible at driving.\n\n1:50:56.580 --> 1:51:00.260\n Bipedal walking, walking, object manipulation.\n\n1:51:00.260 --> 1:51:01.860\n We're incredible at this.\n\n1:51:01.860 --> 1:51:05.820\n And so people tend to discount the things\n\n1:51:05.820 --> 1:51:07.380\n we all just take for granted.\n\n1:51:07.380 --> 1:51:10.180\n And one of those things that they discount\n\n1:51:10.180 --> 1:51:13.580\n is our ability, the dance of conversation\n\n1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:15.340\n and interaction with each other.\n\n1:51:15.340 --> 1:51:18.460\n The ability to morph ideas together.\n\n1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:20.380\n The ability to get angry at each other\n\n1:51:20.380 --> 1:51:21.940\n and then to miss each other.\n\n1:51:21.940 --> 1:51:24.980\n Like to create a tension that makes life fun\n\n1:51:24.980 --> 1:51:28.300\n and difficult and challenging in a way that's meaningful.\n\n1:51:28.300 --> 1:51:31.660\n That is a skill that's learned\n\n1:51:31.660 --> 1:51:33.460\n and AI would need to solve that problem.\n\n1:51:33.460 --> 1:51:35.980\n I mean, in some sense, what you're saying is\n\n1:51:37.020 --> 1:51:42.020\n AI cannot become meaningfully emotional, let's say,\n\n1:51:42.380 --> 1:51:45.220\n until it experiences some kind of internal conflict\n\n1:51:45.220 --> 1:51:48.500\n that is unable to reconcile these various aspects\n\n1:51:48.500 --> 1:51:53.500\n of reality or its reality with a decision to make.\n\n1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.820\n And then it feels sad, necessarily,\n\n1:51:56.820 --> 1:51:59.460\n because it doesn't know what to do.\n\n1:51:59.460 --> 1:52:01.740\n And I certainly can't dispute that.\n\n1:52:01.740 --> 1:52:03.700\n That may very well be how it works.\n\n1:52:03.700 --> 1:52:05.780\n I think the only way to find out is to do it.\n\n1:52:05.780 --> 1:52:06.700\n And to build it.\n\n1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:08.460\n Yeah, and leave it to the philosophers\n\n1:52:08.460 --> 1:52:10.280\n if it actually feels sad or not.\n\n1:52:11.220 --> 1:52:13.860\n The point is the robot will be sitting there alone\n\n1:52:13.860 --> 1:52:16.940\n having an internal conflict, an existential crisis,\n\n1:52:16.940 --> 1:52:19.300\n and that's required for it to have a deep,\n\n1:52:19.300 --> 1:52:21.560\n meaningful connection with another human being.\n\n1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:23.300\n Now, does it actually feel that?\n\n1:52:23.300 --> 1:52:24.140\n I don't know.\n\n1:52:24.140 --> 1:52:26.060\n But I'd like to throw something else at you,\n\n1:52:26.060 --> 1:52:29.220\n which troubles me on reading it.\n\n1:52:31.140 --> 1:52:35.140\n Noah Harari's book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century.\n\n1:52:35.140 --> 1:52:36.520\n And he's written about this kind of thing\n\n1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:38.440\n on various occasions.\n\n1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:40.740\n And he sees biochemistry as an algorithm.\n\n1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:45.160\n And then AI will necessarily be able to hack that algorithm\n\n1:52:45.160 --> 1:52:46.320\n and do it better than humans.\n\n1:52:46.320 --> 1:52:48.800\n So there will be AI better at writing music\n\n1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:50.720\n that we appreciate than Mozart ever could,\n\n1:52:50.720 --> 1:52:53.040\n or writing better than Shakespeare ever did, and so on.\n\n1:52:53.040 --> 1:52:55.560\n Because biochemistry is algorithmic,\n\n1:52:55.560 --> 1:52:56.880\n and all you need to do is figure out\n\n1:52:56.880 --> 1:52:58.720\n which bits of the algorithm to play\n\n1:52:58.720 --> 1:53:02.360\n to make us feel good or bad or appreciate things.\n\n1:53:02.360 --> 1:53:05.680\n And as a biochemist, I find that argument\n\n1:53:05.680 --> 1:53:10.680\n an argument close to irrefutable and not very enjoyable.\n\n1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:14.840\n I don't like the sound of it.\n\n1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:16.480\n That's just my reaction as a human being.\n\n1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:18.160\n You might like the sound of it because that says\n\n1:53:18.160 --> 1:53:23.160\n that AI is capable of the same kind of emotional feelings\n\n1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:25.540\n about the world as we are,\n\n1:53:25.540 --> 1:53:27.080\n because the whole thing is an algorithm\n\n1:53:27.080 --> 1:53:30.200\n and you can program an algorithm, and there you are.\n\n1:53:31.160 --> 1:53:33.520\n He then has a peculiar final chapter\n\n1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:36.080\n where he talks about consciousness\n\n1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:37.640\n in rather separate terms.\n\n1:53:37.640 --> 1:53:39.800\n And he's talking about meditating and so on\n\n1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:41.460\n and getting in touch with his inner conscious.\n\n1:53:41.460 --> 1:53:44.620\n I don't meditate, I don't know anything about that.\n\n1:53:44.620 --> 1:53:48.160\n But he wrote in very different terms about it,\n\n1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:50.900\n as if somehow it's a way out of the algorithm.\n\n1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.100\n Now, it seems to me that consciousness in that sense\n\n1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:58.740\n is capable of scuppering the algorithm.\n\n1:53:58.740 --> 1:54:01.880\n I think in terms of the biochemical feedback loops\n\n1:54:01.880 --> 1:54:04.840\n and so on, it is undoubtedly algorithmic.\n\n1:54:04.840 --> 1:54:06.900\n But in terms of what we decide to do,\n\n1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:10.880\n it can be much more based on an emotion.\n\n1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:16.960\n We can just think, I don't care.\n\n1:54:16.960 --> 1:54:20.280\n I can't resolve this complex situation.\n\n1:54:20.280 --> 1:54:21.540\n I'm gonna do that.\n\n1:54:21.540 --> 1:54:24.760\n And that can be based on, in effect, a different currency,\n\n1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:27.040\n which is the currency of feelings and something\n\n1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:29.980\n where we don't have very much personal control over.\n\n1:54:29.980 --> 1:54:32.040\n And then it comes back around to you\n\n1:54:32.040 --> 1:54:35.360\n and what are you trying to get at with AI?\n\n1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:38.060\n Do we need to have some system\n\n1:54:38.060 --> 1:54:41.840\n which is capable of overriding a rational decision\n\n1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:42.680\n which cannot be made\n\n1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:45.080\n because there's too much conflicting information\n\n1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:48.500\n by effectively an emotional judgmental decision\n\n1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:50.960\n that just says, do this and see what happens.\n\n1:54:50.960 --> 1:54:53.400\n That's what consciousness is really doing in my view.\n\n1:54:53.400 --> 1:54:56.480\n Yeah, and the question is whether it's a different process\n\n1:54:56.480 --> 1:54:59.020\n or just a higher level process.\n\n1:54:59.020 --> 1:55:02.360\n I might, you know, the idea that biochemistry\n\n1:55:02.360 --> 1:55:07.360\n is an algorithm is, to me, an oversimplistic view.\n\n1:55:07.480 --> 1:55:12.480\n There's a lot of things that the moment you say it,\n\n1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:17.040\n it's irrefutable, but it simplifies.\n\n1:55:17.040 --> 1:55:17.880\n Of course.\n\n1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:21.000\n And in the process loses something fundamental.\n\n1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.480\n So for example, calling a universe\n\n1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:27.360\n and an information processing system, sure, yes.\n\n1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:29.720\n You could make that.\n\n1:55:29.720 --> 1:55:32.160\n It's a computer that's performing computations,\n\n1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.160\n but you're missing the process of the entropy\n\n1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:42.760\n somehow leading to pockets of complexity\n\n1:55:42.760 --> 1:55:45.360\n that creates these beautiful artifacts\n\n1:55:45.360 --> 1:55:48.880\n that are incredibly complex and they're like machines.\n\n1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:52.000\n And then those machines are through the process of evolution\n\n1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.560\n are constructing even further complexity.\n\n1:55:54.560 --> 1:55:59.560\n Like in calling universe information processing machine,\n\n1:55:59.860 --> 1:56:03.000\n you're missing those little local pockets\n\n1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.100\n and how difficult it is to create them.\n\n1:56:05.100 --> 1:56:07.880\n So the question to me is if biochemistry is an algorithm,\n\n1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:11.980\n how difficult is it to create a software system\n\n1:56:11.980 --> 1:56:16.240\n that runs the human body, which I think is incorrect.\n\n1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.000\n I think that is going to take so long.\n\n1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:23.500\n I mean, that's going to be centuries from now\n\n1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:25.600\n to be able to reconstruct the human.\n\n1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:27.600\n Now, what I would venture to say\n\n1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:30.400\n to get some of the magic of a human being\n\n1:56:30.400 --> 1:56:32.880\n with what we're saying with the emotions\n\n1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:36.400\n and the interactions and like a dog makes a smile\n\n1:56:36.400 --> 1:56:38.200\n and joyful and all those kinds of things\n\n1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:39.640\n that will come much sooner,\n\n1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:42.280\n but that doesn't require us to reverse engineer\n\n1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:44.080\n the algorithm of biochemistry.\n\n1:56:44.080 --> 1:56:47.680\n Yes, but the toaster is making you happy.\n\n1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:48.640\n Yes.\n\n1:56:48.640 --> 1:56:51.840\n It's not about whether you make the toaster happy.\n\n1:56:51.840 --> 1:56:52.680\n No, it has to be.\n\n1:56:52.680 --> 1:56:55.120\n It has to be.\n\n1:56:55.120 --> 1:56:56.160\n It has to be.\n\n1:56:56.160 --> 1:56:58.060\n The toaster has to be able to leave me happy.\n\n1:56:58.060 --> 1:57:00.080\n Yeah, but it's the toaster is the AI in this case\n\n1:57:00.080 --> 1:57:00.920\n is very intelligent.\n\n1:57:00.920 --> 1:57:03.980\n Yeah, the toaster has to be able to be unhappy and leave me.\n\n1:57:03.980 --> 1:57:06.360\n That's essential.\n\n1:57:06.360 --> 1:57:07.200\n Yeah.\n\n1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:09.780\n That's essential for my being able to miss the toaster.\n\n1:57:09.780 --> 1:57:12.240\n If the toaster is just my servant,\n\n1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:16.000\n that's not, or a provider of like services,\n\n1:57:17.720 --> 1:57:20.440\n like tells me the weather makes toast,\n\n1:57:20.440 --> 1:57:22.760\n that's not going to deep connection.\n\n1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:24.900\n It has to have internal conflict.\n\n1:57:24.900 --> 1:57:26.740\n You write about life and death.\n\n1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:29.840\n It has to be able to be conscious of its mortality\n\n1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:33.760\n and the finiteness of its existence.\n\n1:57:33.760 --> 1:57:35.880\n And that life is for temporary\n\n1:57:35.880 --> 1:57:38.000\n and therefore it needs to be more selective.\n\n1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:41.040\n One of the most moving moments in the movies\n\n1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:45.080\n from when I was a boy was the unplugging of Hal in 2001,\n\n1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:48.620\n where that was the death of a sentient being\n\n1:57:48.620 --> 1:57:51.000\n and Hal knew it.\n\n1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:54.320\n So I think we all kind of know\n\n1:57:55.260 --> 1:58:00.140\n that a sufficiently intelligent being\n\n1:58:00.140 --> 1:58:02.760\n is going to have some form of consciousness,\n\n1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.820\n but whether it would be like biological consciousness,\n\n1:58:06.820 --> 1:58:07.660\n I just don't know.\n\n1:58:07.660 --> 1:58:10.220\n And if you're thinking about how do we bring together,\n\n1:58:10.220 --> 1:58:12.320\n I mean, obviously we're going to interact\n\n1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:16.240\n more closely with AI,\n\n1:58:16.240 --> 1:58:21.240\n but is a dog really like a toaster\n\n1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:25.680\n or is there really some kind of difference there?\n\n1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:29.480\n You were talking about biochemistry is algorithmic,\n\n1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:31.400\n but it's not single algorithm\n\n1:58:31.400 --> 1:58:33.180\n and it's very complex, of course it is.\n\n1:58:33.180 --> 1:58:35.840\n So it may be that there are again conflicts\n\n1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:37.160\n in the circuits of biochemistry,\n\n1:58:37.160 --> 1:58:40.980\n but I have a feeling that the level of complexity\n\n1:58:40.980 --> 1:58:43.280\n of the total biochemical system\n\n1:58:43.280 --> 1:58:45.560\n at the level of a single cell is less complex\n\n1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:48.800\n than the level of neural networking in the human brain\n\n1:58:48.800 --> 1:58:49.720\n or in an AI.\n\n1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:55.760\n Well, I guess I assumed that we were including the brain\n\n1:58:55.760 --> 1:58:59.880\n in the biochemistry algorithm, because you have to...\n\n1:58:59.880 --> 1:59:02.040\n I would see that as a higher level of organization\n\n1:59:02.040 --> 1:59:02.900\n of neural networks.\n\n1:59:02.900 --> 1:59:04.880\n They're all using the same biochemical wiring\n\n1:59:04.880 --> 1:59:06.400\n within themselves.\n\n1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:09.740\n Yeah, but the human brain is not just neurons.\n\n1:59:09.740 --> 1:59:11.640\n It's the immune system.\n\n1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:13.840\n It's the whole package.\n\n1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:16.280\n I mean, to have a biochemical algorithm\n\n1:59:16.280 --> 1:59:20.060\n that runs an intelligent biological system,\n\n1:59:20.060 --> 1:59:21.680\n you have to include the whole damn thing.\n\n1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:24.440\n And it's pretty fascinating that it comes from like,\n\n1:59:24.440 --> 1:59:29.080\n from an embryo, like the whole, I mean, oh boy.\n\n1:59:29.080 --> 1:59:33.220\n I mean, if you can, what is a human being?\n\n1:59:33.220 --> 1:59:36.320\n Because it's just some code and then you built,\n\n1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:39.880\n and then that says DNA doesn't just tell you what to build,\n\n1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:40.880\n but how to build it.\n\n1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:44.640\n I mean, the thing is impressive.\n\n1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:49.480\n And the question is how difficult is it\n\n1:59:49.480 --> 1:59:51.440\n to reverse engineer the whole shebang?\n\n1:59:52.940 --> 1:59:54.400\n Very difficult.\n\n1:59:54.400 --> 1:59:55.820\n I would say it's,\n\n1:59:59.680 --> 2:00:01.200\n don't want to say impossible,\n\n2:00:01.200 --> 2:00:05.380\n but it's like, it's much easier to build a human\n\n2:00:05.380 --> 2:00:09.760\n than to reverse engineer, to build like a fake human,\n\n2:00:09.760 --> 2:00:12.960\n human like thing than to reverse engineer\n\n2:00:12.960 --> 2:00:15.960\n the entirety of the process of the evolution.\n\n2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:18.560\n I'm not sure if we are capable\n\n2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:21.160\n of reverse engineering the whole thing.\n\n2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:23.720\n If the human mind is capable of doing that.\n\n2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:26.720\n I mean, I wouldn't be a biologist if I wasn't trying,\n\n2:00:27.960 --> 2:00:31.160\n but I know I can't understand the whole problem.\n\n2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:33.300\n I'm just trying to understand the rudimentary outlines\n\n2:00:33.300 --> 2:00:34.360\n of the problem.\n\n2:00:35.700 --> 2:00:37.280\n There's another aspect though,\n\n2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:39.200\n you're talking about developing from a single cell\n\n2:00:39.200 --> 2:00:43.920\n to the human mind and all the part system,\n\n2:00:43.920 --> 2:00:46.680\n subsystems that are part of the immune system and so on.\n\n2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:53.240\n This is something that you'll talk about, I imagine,\n\n2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:58.240\n with Michael Levin, but so little is known about,\n\n2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:02.200\n you talk about reverse engineering,\n\n2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:04.640\n so little is known about the developmental pathways\n\n2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:09.160\n that go from a genome to going to a fully wired organism.\n\n2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:11.360\n And a lot of it seems to depend on the same\n\n2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:16.040\n in electrical interactions that I was talking about\n\n2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:17.720\n happening at the level of single cells\n\n2:01:17.720 --> 2:01:19.200\n and its interaction with the environment.\n\n2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:23.600\n There's a whole electrical field side to biology\n\n2:01:23.600 --> 2:01:27.040\n that is not yet written into any of the textbooks,\n\n2:01:27.040 --> 2:01:29.600\n which is about how does an embryo develop into\n\n2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:32.520\n or a single cell develop into these complex systems?\n\n2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:35.040\n What defines the head, what defines the immune system,\n\n2:01:35.040 --> 2:01:37.160\n what defines the brain and so on?\n\n2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:38.680\n That really is written in a language\n\n2:01:38.680 --> 2:01:40.360\n that we're only just beginning to understand\n\n2:01:40.360 --> 2:01:42.840\n and frankly, biologists, most biologists\n\n2:01:42.840 --> 2:01:47.280\n are still very reluctant to even get themselves tangled up\n\n2:01:47.280 --> 2:01:51.680\n in questions like electrical fields influencing development.\n\n2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:54.520\n It seems like mumbo jumbo to a lot of biologists\n\n2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:55.800\n and it should not be because this is\n\n2:01:55.800 --> 2:01:58.840\n the 21st century biology, this is where it's going.\n\n2:01:59.700 --> 2:02:02.080\n But we're not gonna reverse engineer a human being\n\n2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:04.360\n or the mind or any of these subsystems\n\n2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:06.920\n until we understand how this developmental process\n\n2:02:06.920 --> 2:02:10.000\n or how electricity in biology really works.\n\n2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:13.640\n And if it is linked with feelings\n\n2:02:13.640 --> 2:02:15.920\n and with consciousness and so on,\n\n2:02:15.920 --> 2:02:18.680\n that's the, I mean, in the meantime, we have to try,\n\n2:02:18.680 --> 2:02:21.040\n but I think that's where the answer lies.\n\n2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:27.040\n So you think it's possible that the key to things\n\n2:02:27.040 --> 2:02:31.500\n like consciousness are some of the more tricky aspects\n\n2:02:31.500 --> 2:02:34.680\n of cognition might lie in that early development,\n\n2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:37.400\n the interaction of electricity and biology.\n\n2:02:39.300 --> 2:02:40.840\n Electrical fields.\n\n2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:43.100\n But we already know the EEG and so on\n\n2:02:43.100 --> 2:02:44.820\n is telling us a lot about brain function,\n\n2:02:44.820 --> 2:02:46.700\n but we don't know which cells, which parts\n\n2:02:46.700 --> 2:02:48.860\n of a neural network is giving rise to the EEG.\n\n2:02:48.860 --> 2:02:50.520\n We don't know the basics.\n\n2:02:50.520 --> 2:02:53.640\n The assumption is, I mean, we know it's neural networks,\n\n2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:55.740\n we know it's multiple cells, hundreds or thousands\n\n2:02:55.740 --> 2:02:57.980\n of cells involved in it and we assume\n\n2:02:57.980 --> 2:03:01.560\n that it has to do with depolarization during action\n\n2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:03.480\n potentials and so on.\n\n2:03:03.480 --> 2:03:05.360\n But the mitochondria which are in there\n\n2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:08.060\n have much more membranes than the plasma membrane\n\n2:03:08.060 --> 2:03:10.760\n of the neuron and there's a much greater membrane potential\n\n2:03:10.760 --> 2:03:14.420\n and it's formed in parallel, very often parallel cristae,\n\n2:03:14.420 --> 2:03:17.600\n which are capable of reinforcing a field\n\n2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:19.760\n and generating fields over longer distances.\n\n2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.300\n And nobody knows if that plays a role\n\n2:03:23.300 --> 2:03:24.600\n in consciousness or not.\n\n2:03:24.600 --> 2:03:26.400\n There's reasons to argue that it could,\n\n2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:28.900\n but frankly we simply do not know\n\n2:03:28.900 --> 2:03:31.000\n and it's not taken into consideration.\n\n2:03:31.000 --> 2:03:35.260\n You look at the structure of the mitochondrial membranes\n\n2:03:35.260 --> 2:03:39.440\n in the brains of simple things like Drosophila,\n\n2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:42.160\n the fruit fly, and they have amazing structures.\n\n2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:44.200\n You can see lots of little rectangular things\n\n2:03:44.200 --> 2:03:48.040\n all lined up in amazing patterns.\n\n2:03:48.040 --> 2:03:49.040\n What are they doing?\n\n2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:49.920\n Why are they like that?\n\n2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:51.280\n We haven't the first clue.\n\n2:03:52.460 --> 2:03:55.340\n What do you think about organoids and brain organoids\n\n2:03:55.340 --> 2:03:59.560\n and so in a lab trying to study the development\n\n2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:04.560\n of these in the Petri dish development of organs.\n\n2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:06.860\n Do you think that's promising?\n\n2:04:06.860 --> 2:04:08.640\n Do you have to look at whole systems?\n\n2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:10.320\n I've never done anything like that.\n\n2:04:10.320 --> 2:04:11.440\n I don't know much about it.\n\n2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:13.640\n The people who I've talked to who do work on it\n\n2:04:13.640 --> 2:04:15.160\n say amazing things can happen\n\n2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:18.480\n and a bit of a brain grown in a dish\n\n2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:21.400\n is capable of experiencing some kind of feelings\n\n2:04:21.400 --> 2:04:23.480\n or even memories of its former brain.\n\n2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:27.420\n Again, I have a feeling that until we understand\n\n2:04:27.420 --> 2:04:29.540\n how to control the electrical fields\n\n2:04:29.540 --> 2:04:32.340\n that control development, we're not going to understand\n\n2:04:32.340 --> 2:04:35.280\n how to turn an organoid into a real functional system.\n\n2:04:36.620 --> 2:04:38.500\n But how do we get that understanding?\n\n2:04:38.500 --> 2:04:41.940\n It's so incredibly difficult.\n\n2:04:41.940 --> 2:04:44.700\n I mean, you would have to, I mean, one promising direction,\n\n2:04:44.700 --> 2:04:46.820\n I'd love to get your opinion on this.\n\n2:04:46.820 --> 2:04:49.020\n I don't know if you're familiar with the work of DeepMind\n\n2:04:49.020 --> 2:04:52.180\n and AlphaFold with protein folding and so on.\n\n2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:54.060\n Do you think it's possible\n\n2:04:54.060 --> 2:04:57.980\n that that will give us some breakthroughs in biology\n\n2:04:57.980 --> 2:05:02.980\n trying to basically simulate and model the behavior\n\n2:05:03.700 --> 2:05:07.180\n of trivial biological systems\n\n2:05:07.180 --> 2:05:09.900\n as they become complex biological systems?\n\n2:05:11.420 --> 2:05:12.780\n I'm sure it will.\n\n2:05:12.780 --> 2:05:16.340\n The interesting thing to me about protein folding\n\n2:05:16.340 --> 2:05:19.780\n is that for a long time, my understanding,\n\n2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:21.580\n this is not what I work on, so I may have got this wrong,\n\n2:05:21.580 --> 2:05:24.460\n but my understanding is that you take the sequence\n\n2:05:24.460 --> 2:05:27.720\n of a protein and you try to fold it.\n\n2:05:28.980 --> 2:05:31.020\n And there are multiple ways in which it can fold.\n\n2:05:31.020 --> 2:05:33.180\n And to come up with the correct conformation\n\n2:05:33.180 --> 2:05:35.100\n is not a very easy thing because you're doing it\n\n2:05:35.100 --> 2:05:37.420\n from first principles from a string of letters,\n\n2:05:37.420 --> 2:05:39.900\n which specify the string of amino acids.\n\n2:05:39.900 --> 2:05:43.460\n But what actually happens is when a protein\n\n2:05:43.460 --> 2:05:45.740\n is coming out of a ribosome,\n\n2:05:45.740 --> 2:05:47.940\n it's coming out of a charged tunnel\n\n2:05:47.940 --> 2:05:49.620\n and it's in a very specific environment,\n\n2:05:49.620 --> 2:05:51.460\n which is going to force this to go there now\n\n2:05:51.460 --> 2:05:53.340\n and then this one to go there and this one to come like that.\n\n2:05:53.340 --> 2:05:55.900\n And so you're forcing a specific conformational set\n\n2:05:55.900 --> 2:05:58.420\n of changes onto it as it comes out of the ribosome.\n\n2:05:58.420 --> 2:06:00.060\n So by the time it's fully emerged,\n\n2:06:00.060 --> 2:06:01.860\n it's already got its shape.\n\n2:06:01.860 --> 2:06:06.540\n And that shape depended on the immediate environment\n\n2:06:06.540 --> 2:06:09.100\n that it was emerging into one letter,\n\n2:06:09.100 --> 2:06:11.900\n one amino acid at a time.\n\n2:06:11.900 --> 2:06:16.900\n And I don't think that the field was looking at it that way.\n\n2:06:16.980 --> 2:06:18.740\n And if that's correct,\n\n2:06:18.740 --> 2:06:20.540\n then that's very characteristic of science,\n\n2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:23.100\n which is to say it asks very often the wrong question\n\n2:06:23.100 --> 2:06:25.820\n and then does really amazingly sophisticated analyses\n\n2:06:25.820 --> 2:06:27.860\n on something having never thought to actually think,\n\n2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:29.060\n well, what is biology doing?\n\n2:06:29.060 --> 2:06:31.860\n And biology is giving you a charged electrical environment\n\n2:06:31.860 --> 2:06:33.380\n that forces you to be this way.\n\n2:06:33.380 --> 2:06:37.940\n Now, did DeepMind come up through patterns\n\n2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:39.780\n with some answer that was like that?\n\n2:06:39.780 --> 2:06:41.820\n I've got absolutely no idea.\n\n2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:44.420\n It ought to be possible to deduce that\n\n2:06:44.420 --> 2:06:46.500\n from the shapes of proteins.\n\n2:06:46.500 --> 2:06:50.780\n It would require a much greater skill\n\n2:06:50.780 --> 2:06:52.820\n than the human mind has.\n\n2:06:52.820 --> 2:06:55.140\n But the human mind is capable of saying, well, hang on,\n\n2:06:55.140 --> 2:06:57.080\n let's look at this exit tunnel and try and work out\n\n2:06:57.080 --> 2:06:58.940\n what shape is this protein going to take?\n\n2:06:58.940 --> 2:07:00.140\n And we can figure that out.\n\n2:07:00.140 --> 2:07:01.580\n That's really interesting about the exit tunnel,\n\n2:07:01.580 --> 2:07:03.060\n but like sometimes we get lucky\n\n2:07:03.060 --> 2:07:08.060\n and just like in science, the simplified view\n\n2:07:08.540 --> 2:07:12.140\n or the static view will actually solve the problem for us.\n\n2:07:12.140 --> 2:07:14.380\n So in this case, it's very possible\n\n2:07:14.380 --> 2:07:17.220\n that the sequence of letters has a unique mapping\n\n2:07:17.220 --> 2:07:21.440\n to our structure without considering how it unraveled.\n\n2:07:21.440 --> 2:07:23.740\n So without considering the tunnel.\n\n2:07:23.740 --> 2:07:27.700\n And so that seems to be the case in this situation\n\n2:07:27.700 --> 2:07:29.700\n where the cool thing about proteins,\n\n2:07:29.700 --> 2:07:31.580\n all the different shapes they can possibly take,\n\n2:07:31.580 --> 2:07:35.300\n it actually seems to take very specific unique shapes\n\n2:07:35.300 --> 2:07:36.660\n given the sequence.\n\n2:07:36.660 --> 2:07:38.260\n That's forced on you by an exit tunnel.\n\n2:07:38.260 --> 2:07:40.780\n So the problem is actually much simpler than you thought.\n\n2:07:40.780 --> 2:07:44.200\n And then there's a whole army of proteins\n\n2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:49.200\n which change the conformational state, chaperone proteins.\n\n2:07:49.780 --> 2:07:54.780\n And they're only used when there's some presumably issue\n\n2:07:54.900 --> 2:07:56.500\n with how it came out of the exit tunnel\n\n2:07:56.500 --> 2:07:58.020\n and you wanna do it differently to that.\n\n2:07:58.020 --> 2:08:00.780\n So very often the chaperone proteins will go there\n\n2:08:00.780 --> 2:08:03.520\n and will influence the way in which it falls.\n\n2:08:03.520 --> 2:08:06.620\n So there's two ways of doing it.\n\n2:08:06.620 --> 2:08:09.280\n Either you can look at the structures\n\n2:08:09.280 --> 2:08:11.020\n and the sequences of all the proteins\n\n2:08:11.020 --> 2:08:13.220\n and you can apply an immense mind to it\n\n2:08:13.220 --> 2:08:14.620\n and figure out what the patterns are\n\n2:08:14.620 --> 2:08:15.660\n and figure out what happened.\n\n2:08:15.660 --> 2:08:17.940\n Or you can look at the actual situation where it is\n\n2:08:17.940 --> 2:08:20.100\n and say, well, hang on, it was actually quite simple.\n\n2:08:20.100 --> 2:08:21.220\n It's got a charged environment\n\n2:08:21.220 --> 2:08:23.140\n and then it's forced to come out this way.\n\n2:08:23.140 --> 2:08:24.040\n And then the question will be,\n\n2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:25.460\n well, do different ribosomes\n\n2:08:25.460 --> 2:08:27.060\n have different charged environments?\n\n2:08:27.060 --> 2:08:28.780\n What happens if a chaperone?\n\n2:08:28.780 --> 2:08:30.460\n You're asking a different set of questions\n\n2:08:30.460 --> 2:08:31.780\n to come to the same answer in a way\n\n2:08:31.780 --> 2:08:34.260\n which is telling you a much simpler story\n\n2:08:34.260 --> 2:08:37.800\n and explains why it is rather than saying it could be,\n\n2:08:37.800 --> 2:08:41.060\n this is one in a billion different possible conformational\n\n2:08:41.060 --> 2:08:42.340\n states that this protein could have.\n\n2:08:42.340 --> 2:08:43.460\n You're saying, well, it has this one\n\n2:08:43.460 --> 2:08:46.060\n because that was the only one it could take\n\n2:08:46.060 --> 2:08:48.340\n given its setting.\n\n2:08:48.340 --> 2:08:51.100\n Well, yeah, I mean, currently humans are very good\n\n2:08:51.100 --> 2:08:52.940\n at that kind of first principles thinking.\n\n2:08:52.940 --> 2:08:56.060\n I was stepping back, but I think AI is really good\n\n2:08:56.060 --> 2:08:58.980\n at collecting a huge amount of data\n\n2:08:58.980 --> 2:09:01.980\n and a huge amount of data of observation of planets\n\n2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:04.520\n and figure out that Earth is not at the center\n\n2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:06.480\n of the universe, that there's actually a sun,\n\n2:09:06.480 --> 2:09:08.020\n we're orbiting the sun.\n\n2:09:08.020 --> 2:09:10.060\n But then you can, as a human being, ask,\n\n2:09:10.060 --> 2:09:13.180\n well, how do solar systems come to be?\n\n2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:17.540\n What are the different forces that are required\n\n2:09:17.540 --> 2:09:19.940\n to make this kind of pattern emerge?\n\n2:09:19.940 --> 2:09:22.600\n And then you start to invent things like gravity.\n\n2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:29.820\n I mixed up the ordering of gravity,\n\n2:09:29.820 --> 2:09:32.640\n wasn't considered as a thing that connects planets,\n\n2:09:32.640 --> 2:09:36.900\n but we are able to think about those big picture things\n\n2:09:36.900 --> 2:09:38.300\n as human beings.\n\n2:09:38.300 --> 2:09:42.260\n AI is just very good to infer simple models\n\n2:09:42.260 --> 2:09:44.280\n from a huge amount of data.\n\n2:09:45.820 --> 2:09:47.980\n And the question is with biology,\n\n2:09:47.980 --> 2:09:50.980\n we kind of go back and forth at how we solve biology.\n\n2:09:50.980 --> 2:09:54.500\n Listen, protein folding was thought to be impossible\n\n2:09:54.500 --> 2:09:57.580\n to solve, and there's a lot of brilliant PhD students\n\n2:09:57.580 --> 2:09:59.460\n that worked one protein at a time\n\n2:09:59.460 --> 2:10:00.900\n trying to figure out the structure.\n\n2:10:00.900 --> 2:10:03.540\n And the fact that I was able to do that.\n\n2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:06.340\n Oh, I'm not knocking it at all,\n\n2:10:06.340 --> 2:10:08.940\n but I think that people have been asking\n\n2:10:08.940 --> 2:10:09.780\n the wrong question.\n\n2:10:09.780 --> 2:10:13.500\n But then, as the people start to ask\n\n2:10:13.500 --> 2:10:17.220\n better and bigger questions,\n\n2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:20.980\n the AI kind of enters the chat and says,\n\n2:10:20.980 --> 2:10:22.700\n I'll help you out with that.\n\n2:10:22.700 --> 2:10:25.100\n Can I give you another example for my own work?\n\n2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:30.700\n The risk of getting a disease as we get older,\n\n2:10:32.260 --> 2:10:35.260\n there are genetic aspects to it.\n\n2:10:35.260 --> 2:10:38.500\n If you spend your whole life overeating and smoking\n\n2:10:38.500 --> 2:10:41.580\n and whatever, that's a whole separate question.\n\n2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.260\n But there's a genetic side to the risk.\n\n2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:46.540\n And we know a few genes that increase your risk\n\n2:10:46.540 --> 2:10:47.380\n of certain things.\n\n2:10:47.380 --> 2:10:49.660\n And for probably 20 years now,\n\n2:10:49.660 --> 2:10:51.660\n people have been doing what's called GWAS,\n\n2:10:51.660 --> 2:10:55.300\n which is genome wide association studies.\n\n2:10:55.300 --> 2:10:58.820\n So you've effectively scanned the entire genome\n\n2:10:58.820 --> 2:11:02.220\n for any single nucleotide polymorphisms,\n\n2:11:02.220 --> 2:11:04.980\n which is to say a single letter change in one place,\n\n2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:07.460\n that has a higher association of being linked\n\n2:11:07.460 --> 2:11:09.260\n with a particular disease or not.\n\n2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:10.940\n And you can come up with thousands of these things\n\n2:11:10.940 --> 2:11:11.820\n across the genome.\n\n2:11:13.260 --> 2:11:17.180\n And if you add them all up and try and say,\n\n2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:20.820\n well, so do they add up to explain\n\n2:11:20.820 --> 2:11:23.700\n the known genetic risk of this disease?\n\n2:11:23.700 --> 2:11:26.180\n And the known genetic risk often comes from twin studies.\n\n2:11:26.180 --> 2:11:30.620\n And you can say that if this twin gets epilepsy,\n\n2:11:30.620 --> 2:11:33.620\n there's a 40 or 50% risk that the other twin,\n\n2:11:33.620 --> 2:11:35.820\n identical twin will also get epilepsy.\n\n2:11:35.820 --> 2:11:39.100\n Therefore, the genetic factor is about 50%.\n\n2:11:39.100 --> 2:11:43.020\n And so the gene similarities that you see\n\n2:11:43.020 --> 2:11:46.420\n should account for 50% of that known risk.\n\n2:11:46.420 --> 2:11:49.220\n Very often it accounts for less than a 10th\n\n2:11:49.220 --> 2:11:50.820\n of the known risk.\n\n2:11:50.820 --> 2:11:52.980\n And there's two possible explanations.\n\n2:11:52.980 --> 2:11:54.460\n And there's one which people tend to do,\n\n2:11:54.460 --> 2:11:55.300\n which is to say,\n\n2:11:55.300 --> 2:11:58.180\n ah, well, we don't have enough statistical power.\n\n2:11:58.180 --> 2:12:00.260\n If we, maybe there's a million,\n\n2:12:00.260 --> 2:12:01.620\n we've only found a thousand of them.\n\n2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:02.860\n But if we find the other million,\n\n2:12:02.860 --> 2:12:03.820\n they're weakly related,\n\n2:12:03.820 --> 2:12:05.140\n but there's a huge number of them.\n\n2:12:05.140 --> 2:12:07.420\n And so we'll account for that whole risk.\n\n2:12:07.420 --> 2:12:10.060\n Maybe there's a billion of them.\n\n2:12:11.500 --> 2:12:12.780\n So that's one way.\n\n2:12:12.780 --> 2:12:14.260\n The other way is to say,\n\n2:12:15.260 --> 2:12:17.020\n well, hang on a minute, you're missing a system here.\n\n2:12:17.020 --> 2:12:19.140\n That system is the mitochondrial DNA,\n\n2:12:19.140 --> 2:12:21.860\n which people tend to dismiss because it's small\n\n2:12:21.860 --> 2:12:25.020\n and it doesn't change very much.\n\n2:12:27.020 --> 2:12:30.860\n But a few single letter changes in that mitochondrial DNA,\n\n2:12:30.860 --> 2:12:33.620\n it controls some really basic processes.\n\n2:12:33.620 --> 2:12:36.540\n It controls not only all the energy\n\n2:12:36.540 --> 2:12:38.780\n that we need to live and to move around\n\n2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:39.700\n and do everything we do,\n\n2:12:39.700 --> 2:12:44.380\n but also biosynthesis to make the new building blocks\n\n2:12:44.380 --> 2:12:47.420\n to make new cells.\n\n2:12:47.420 --> 2:12:49.780\n And cancer cells very often kind of take over\n\n2:12:49.780 --> 2:12:52.100\n the mitochondria and rewire them\n\n2:12:52.100 --> 2:12:54.620\n so that instead of using them for making energy,\n\n2:12:54.620 --> 2:12:56.500\n they're effectively using them as precursors\n\n2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.460\n for the building blocks for biosynthesis.\n\n2:12:58.460 --> 2:12:59.940\n You need to make new amino acids,\n\n2:12:59.940 --> 2:13:01.380\n new nucleotides for DNA.\n\n2:13:01.380 --> 2:13:04.700\n You wanna make new lipids to make your membranes and so on.\n\n2:13:04.700 --> 2:13:06.940\n So they kind of rewire metabolism.\n\n2:13:06.940 --> 2:13:10.220\n Now, the problem is that we've got all these interactions\n\n2:13:10.220 --> 2:13:13.420\n between mitochondrial DNA and the genes in the nucleus\n\n2:13:13.420 --> 2:13:15.380\n that are overlooked completely\n\n2:13:15.380 --> 2:13:16.660\n because people throw away,\n\n2:13:16.660 --> 2:13:18.740\n literally throw away the mitochondrial genes.\n\n2:13:18.740 --> 2:13:21.060\n And we can see in fruit flies that they interact\n\n2:13:21.060 --> 2:13:24.500\n and produce big differences in risk.\n\n2:13:24.500 --> 2:13:29.500\n So you can set AI onto this question\n\n2:13:29.500 --> 2:13:34.500\n of exactly how many of these base changes there are.\n\n2:13:35.100 --> 2:13:36.940\n And this is one possible solution\n\n2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:39.100\n that maybe there are a million of them\n\n2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:41.220\n and it does account for the greatest part of the risk.\n\n2:13:41.220 --> 2:13:43.660\n Or the other one is they aren't, it's just not there.\n\n2:13:43.660 --> 2:13:45.300\n That actually the risk lies in something\n\n2:13:45.300 --> 2:13:47.140\n you weren't even looking at.\n\n2:13:47.140 --> 2:13:50.860\n And this is where human intuition is very important.\n\n2:13:50.860 --> 2:13:53.580\n And just this feeling that, well, I'm working on this\n\n2:13:53.580 --> 2:13:56.220\n and I think it's important and I'm bloody minded about it.\n\n2:13:56.220 --> 2:13:57.580\n And in the end, some people are right.\n\n2:13:57.580 --> 2:14:00.180\n It turns out that it was important.\n\n2:14:00.180 --> 2:14:03.180\n Can you get AI to do that, to be bloody minded?\n\n2:14:03.180 --> 2:14:06.620\n And that, hang on a minute,\n\n2:14:06.620 --> 2:14:09.340\n you might be missing a whole other system here\n\n2:14:09.340 --> 2:14:11.140\n that's much bigger.\n\n2:14:11.140 --> 2:14:16.140\n That's the moment of discovery of scientific revolution.\n\n2:14:17.500 --> 2:14:21.380\n I'm giving up on saying AI can't do something.\n\n2:14:22.260 --> 2:14:25.220\n I've said it enough times about enough things.\n\n2:14:25.220 --> 2:14:27.460\n I think there's been a lot of progress.\n\n2:14:27.460 --> 2:14:30.220\n And instead I'm excited by the possibility\n\n2:14:30.220 --> 2:14:31.420\n of AI helping humans.\n\n2:14:31.420 --> 2:14:34.420\n But at the same time, just like I said,\n\n2:14:34.420 --> 2:14:37.380\n we seem to dismiss the power of humans.\n\n2:14:37.380 --> 2:14:38.460\n Yes, yes.\n\n2:14:38.460 --> 2:14:41.900\n Like we're so limited in so many ways\n\n2:14:43.900 --> 2:14:48.540\n that we kind of, in what we feel like dumb ways,\n\n2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:53.540\n like we're not strong, we're kind of our attention,\n\n2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:57.060\n our attention, our memory is limited.\n\n2:14:57.060 --> 2:15:00.260\n Our ability to focus on things is limited\n\n2:15:00.260 --> 2:15:02.740\n in our own perception of what limited is.\n\n2:15:02.740 --> 2:15:05.460\n But that actually, there's an incredible computer\n\n2:15:05.460 --> 2:15:08.900\n behind the whole thing that makes this whole system work.\n\n2:15:08.900 --> 2:15:11.860\n Our ability to interact with the environment,\n\n2:15:11.860 --> 2:15:13.300\n to reason about the environment.\n\n2:15:13.300 --> 2:15:14.940\n There's magic there.\n\n2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:17.340\n And I'm hopeful that AI can capture\n\n2:15:17.340 --> 2:15:18.740\n some of that same magic.\n\n2:15:18.740 --> 2:15:20.820\n But that magic is not gonna look like\n\n2:15:20.820 --> 2:15:22.460\n Deep Blue playing chess.\n\n2:15:22.460 --> 2:15:24.740\n No, it's going to be more interesting.\n\n2:15:24.740 --> 2:15:25.940\n But I don't think it's gonna look\n\n2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:27.980\n like pattern finding either.\n\n2:15:27.980 --> 2:15:29.620\n I mean, that's essentially what you're telling me.\n\n2:15:29.620 --> 2:15:30.740\n It does very well at the moment.\n\n2:15:30.740 --> 2:15:33.020\n And my point is it works very well\n\n2:15:33.020 --> 2:15:36.180\n where you're looking for the right pattern.\n\n2:15:36.180 --> 2:15:38.540\n But we are storytelling animals\n\n2:15:38.540 --> 2:15:40.860\n and the hypothesis is a story.\n\n2:15:40.860 --> 2:15:42.500\n It's a testable story.\n\n2:15:42.500 --> 2:15:47.180\n But a new hypothesis is a leap into the unknown\n\n2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:48.460\n and it's a new story basically.\n\n2:15:48.460 --> 2:15:51.020\n And it says this leads to this leads to that.\n\n2:15:51.020 --> 2:15:54.940\n It's a causal set of storytelling.\n\n2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:57.420\n It's also possible that the leap into the unknown\n\n2:15:57.420 --> 2:15:58.660\n has a pattern of its own.\n\n2:15:58.660 --> 2:15:59.740\n Yes, it is.\n\n2:15:59.740 --> 2:16:02.500\n And it's possible that it's learnable.\n\n2:16:02.500 --> 2:16:04.260\n I'm sure it is.\n\n2:16:04.260 --> 2:16:06.820\n There's a nice book by Arthur Kessler\n\n2:16:06.820 --> 2:16:11.260\n on the nature of creativity.\n\n2:16:11.260 --> 2:16:13.980\n And he likens it to a joke where the punchline goes off\n\n2:16:13.980 --> 2:16:15.580\n in a completely unexpected direction\n\n2:16:15.580 --> 2:16:18.500\n and says that this is the basis of human creativity.\n\n2:16:18.500 --> 2:16:21.500\n That some creative switch of direction\n\n2:16:21.500 --> 2:16:25.020\n to an unexpected place is similar to a joke.\n\n2:16:25.020 --> 2:16:26.300\n I'm not saying that's how it works,\n\n2:16:26.300 --> 2:16:29.380\n but it's a nice idea and there must be some truth in it.\n\n2:16:30.740 --> 2:16:32.340\n And it's one of these,\n\n2:16:32.340 --> 2:16:34.900\n most of the stories we tell are probably the wrong story\n\n2:16:34.900 --> 2:16:37.580\n and probably going nowhere and probably not helpful.\n\n2:16:37.580 --> 2:16:39.820\n And we definitely don't do as well\n\n2:16:39.820 --> 2:16:41.700\n at seeing patterns in things.\n\n2:16:41.700 --> 2:16:44.380\n But some of the most enjoyable human aspects\n\n2:16:44.380 --> 2:16:47.660\n is finding a new story that goes to an unexpected place.\n\n2:16:47.660 --> 2:16:48.940\n And again, these are all aspects\n\n2:16:48.940 --> 2:16:51.580\n of what being human means to me.\n\n2:16:52.580 --> 2:16:53.820\n And maybe these are all things\n\n2:16:53.820 --> 2:16:55.780\n that AI figures out for itself,\n\n2:16:55.780 --> 2:16:58.020\n or maybe they're just aspects.\n\n2:16:58.020 --> 2:17:00.300\n But I just have the feeling sometimes\n\n2:17:00.300 --> 2:17:04.860\n that the people who are trying to understand\n\n2:17:04.860 --> 2:17:07.540\n what we are like,\n\n2:17:08.780 --> 2:17:10.620\n if we wish to craft an AI system\n\n2:17:10.620 --> 2:17:12.740\n which is somehow human like,\n\n2:17:12.740 --> 2:17:16.500\n that we don't have a firm enough grasp\n\n2:17:16.500 --> 2:17:20.580\n of what humans really are like in terms of how we are built.\n\n2:17:21.460 --> 2:17:25.020\n But we get a better, better understanding of that.\n\n2:17:25.020 --> 2:17:26.620\n I agree with you completely.\n\n2:17:26.620 --> 2:17:29.300\n We try to build a thing and then we go,\n\n2:17:29.300 --> 2:17:33.060\n hang on a minute, there's another system here.\n\n2:17:33.060 --> 2:17:35.900\n And that's actually the attempt to build AI\n\n2:17:35.900 --> 2:17:36.980\n that's human like,\n\n2:17:36.980 --> 2:17:39.940\n is getting us to a deeper understanding of human beings.\n\n2:17:39.940 --> 2:17:42.900\n The funny thing that I recently talked to Magnus Carlsen,\n\n2:17:42.900 --> 2:17:44.700\n why they consider to be the greatest chess player\n\n2:17:44.700 --> 2:17:46.620\n of all time.\n\n2:17:46.620 --> 2:17:48.540\n And he talked about AlphaZero,\n\n2:17:48.540 --> 2:17:51.620\n which is a system from DeepMind that plays chess.\n\n2:17:51.620 --> 2:17:53.220\n And he had a funny comment.\n\n2:17:55.260 --> 2:17:57.620\n He has a kind of dry sense of humor.\n\n2:17:57.620 --> 2:17:59.460\n But he was extremely impressed\n\n2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:02.100\n when he first saw AlphaZero play.\n\n2:18:02.100 --> 2:18:04.620\n And he said that it did a lot of things\n\n2:18:04.620 --> 2:18:07.460\n that could easily be mistaken for creativity.\n\n2:18:07.460 --> 2:18:12.140\n So he like, as a typical human,\n\n2:18:12.140 --> 2:18:16.860\n refused to give the system sort of its due.\n\n2:18:16.860 --> 2:18:18.540\n Because he came up with a lot of things\n\n2:18:18.540 --> 2:18:22.620\n that a lot of people are extremely impressed by.\n\n2:18:22.620 --> 2:18:24.220\n Not just the sheer calculation,\n\n2:18:24.220 --> 2:18:26.820\n but the brilliance of play.\n\n2:18:26.820 --> 2:18:30.940\n So one of the things that it does\n\n2:18:31.940 --> 2:18:35.460\n in really interesting ways is it sacrifices pieces.\n\n2:18:35.460 --> 2:18:39.980\n So in chess, that means you basically take a few steps back\n\n2:18:39.980 --> 2:18:41.700\n and then take a step forward.\n\n2:18:41.700 --> 2:18:46.140\n You give away pieces for some future reward.\n\n2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:50.740\n And that, for us humans, is where art is in chess.\n\n2:18:50.740 --> 2:18:52.540\n You take big risks.\n\n2:18:52.540 --> 2:18:57.540\n That for us humans, those risks are especially painful\n\n2:18:58.620 --> 2:19:02.260\n because you have a fog of uncertainty before you.\n\n2:19:02.260 --> 2:19:05.100\n So to take a risk now based on intuition\n\n2:19:05.100 --> 2:19:07.460\n of I think this is the right risk to take,\n\n2:19:07.460 --> 2:19:09.620\n but there's so many possibilities,\n\n2:19:09.620 --> 2:19:11.300\n that that's where it takes guts.\n\n2:19:11.300 --> 2:19:14.060\n That's where art is, that's that danger.\n\n2:19:14.060 --> 2:19:17.860\n And then the alpha,\n\n2:19:17.860 --> 2:19:20.460\n alpha zero takes those same kind of risks\n\n2:19:20.460 --> 2:19:22.380\n and does them even greater degree.\n\n2:19:22.380 --> 2:19:25.180\n But of course, it does it from a,\n\n2:19:26.780 --> 2:19:30.340\n well, you could easily reduce down\n\n2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:34.580\n to a cold calculation over patterns.\n\n2:19:34.580 --> 2:19:37.820\n But boy, when you see the final result,\n\n2:19:37.820 --> 2:19:39.980\n it sure looks like the same kind of magic\n\n2:19:39.980 --> 2:19:41.900\n that we see in creativity.\n\n2:19:41.900 --> 2:19:45.140\n When we see creative play on the chessboard,\n\n2:19:45.140 --> 2:19:46.820\n but the chessboard is very limited.\n\n2:19:46.820 --> 2:19:49.060\n And the question is, as we get better and better,\n\n2:19:49.060 --> 2:19:54.060\n can we do that same kind of creativity in mathematics,\n\n2:19:54.140 --> 2:19:59.140\n in programming, and then eventually in biology, psychology,\n\n2:19:59.580 --> 2:20:04.020\n and expand into more and more complex systems?\n\n2:20:04.020 --> 2:20:07.180\n I was, I used to go running when I was a boy,\n\n2:20:07.180 --> 2:20:10.460\n and fell running, which is to say, running up and down mountains.\n\n2:20:10.460 --> 2:20:12.740\n And I was never particularly great at it,\n\n2:20:12.740 --> 2:20:16.780\n but there were some people who were amazingly fast,\n\n2:20:16.780 --> 2:20:18.580\n especially at running down.\n\n2:20:18.580 --> 2:20:21.100\n And I realized in trying to do this,\n\n2:20:21.100 --> 2:20:25.020\n that there's only really two ways,\n\n2:20:25.020 --> 2:20:26.500\n there's three possible ways of doing it,\n\n2:20:26.500 --> 2:20:27.700\n and there's only two that work.\n\n2:20:27.700 --> 2:20:30.460\n Either you go extremely slowly and carefully,\n\n2:20:30.460 --> 2:20:32.460\n and you figure out, okay, there's a stone,\n\n2:20:32.460 --> 2:20:33.820\n I'll put my foot on this stone,\n\n2:20:33.820 --> 2:20:35.580\n and then there's another,\n\n2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:37.100\n there's a muddy puddle I'm going to avoid.\n\n2:20:37.100 --> 2:20:39.580\n And you know, it's slow, it's laborious.\n\n2:20:39.580 --> 2:20:41.340\n You figure it out step by step.\n\n2:20:42.420 --> 2:20:44.340\n Or you can just go incredibly fast,\n\n2:20:44.340 --> 2:20:45.660\n and you don't think about it at all.\n\n2:20:45.660 --> 2:20:47.700\n The entire conscious mind is shut out of it,\n\n2:20:47.700 --> 2:20:49.780\n and it's probably the same playing table tennis\n\n2:20:49.780 --> 2:20:51.340\n or something, there's something in the mind,\n\n2:20:51.340 --> 2:20:54.260\n which is doing a whole lot of subconscious calculations\n\n2:20:54.260 --> 2:20:55.580\n about exact, and it's amazing.\n\n2:20:55.580 --> 2:20:58.260\n You can run at astonishing speed down a hillside\n\n2:20:58.260 --> 2:21:00.500\n with no idea how you did it at all.\n\n2:21:00.500 --> 2:21:01.900\n And then you panic, and you think,\n\n2:21:01.900 --> 2:21:03.580\n I'm going to break my leg if I keep doing this,\n\n2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:05.700\n I've got to think about where I'm going to put my foot.\n\n2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:07.140\n So you slow down a bit and try to bring\n\n2:21:07.140 --> 2:21:09.820\n those conscious mind in, and then you do, you crash.\n\n2:21:09.820 --> 2:21:14.460\n You cannot think consciously while running downhill.\n\n2:21:14.460 --> 2:21:18.500\n So it's amazing how many calculations\n\n2:21:18.500 --> 2:21:21.380\n the mind is able to make.\n\n2:21:21.380 --> 2:21:23.740\n And now the problem with playing chess or something,\n\n2:21:23.740 --> 2:21:25.620\n if you're able to make all of those subconscious\n\n2:21:25.620 --> 2:21:28.620\n kind of forward calculations about\n\n2:21:28.620 --> 2:21:32.420\n what is the likely outcome of this move now\n\n2:21:32.420 --> 2:21:34.740\n in the way that we can by running down a hillside\n\n2:21:34.740 --> 2:21:38.260\n or something, it's partly about what we have adapted to do.\n\n2:21:38.260 --> 2:21:40.500\n It's partly about the reality of the world that we're in.\n\n2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:42.100\n Running fast downhill is something\n\n2:21:42.100 --> 2:21:43.180\n that we better be bloody good at,\n\n2:21:43.180 --> 2:21:44.980\n otherwise we're going to be eaten.\n\n2:21:46.180 --> 2:21:51.100\n Whereas trying to calculate multiple, multiple moves\n\n2:21:51.100 --> 2:21:52.620\n into the future is not something\n\n2:21:52.620 --> 2:21:54.180\n we've ever been called on to do.\n\n2:21:54.180 --> 2:21:55.860\n Two or three, four moves into the future\n\n2:21:55.860 --> 2:21:58.700\n is quite enough for most of us most of the time.\n\n2:21:58.700 --> 2:22:03.700\n Yeah, yeah, so yeah, just solving chess may not,\n\n2:22:05.700 --> 2:22:10.180\n we may not be as far towards solving the problem\n\n2:22:10.180 --> 2:22:14.700\n of downhill running as we might think\n\n2:22:14.700 --> 2:22:16.300\n just because we solve chess.\n\n2:22:17.300 --> 2:22:20.860\n Still, it's beautiful to see creativity.\n\n2:22:20.860 --> 2:22:23.380\n Humans create machines.\n\n2:22:23.380 --> 2:22:27.780\n They're able to create art and art on a chessboard\n\n2:22:27.780 --> 2:22:29.420\n and art otherwise.\n\n2:22:29.420 --> 2:22:31.780\n Who knows how far that takes us.\n\n2:22:31.780 --> 2:22:35.300\n So I mentioned Andrej Karpathy earlier.\n\n2:22:35.300 --> 2:22:37.340\n Him and I are big fans of yours.\n\n2:22:37.340 --> 2:22:39.700\n If you're taking votes, his suggestion was\n\n2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:42.580\n you should write your next book on the Fermi Paradox.\n\n2:22:43.540 --> 2:22:47.820\n So let me ask you on the topic of alien life.\n\n2:22:49.020 --> 2:22:50.420\n Since we've been talking about life\n\n2:22:50.420 --> 2:22:51.980\n and we're a kind of aliens,\n\n2:22:51.980 --> 2:22:56.980\n how many alien civilizations are out there, do you think?\n\n2:22:58.220 --> 2:23:01.500\n Well, the universe is very big, so some,\n\n2:23:01.500 --> 2:23:04.220\n but not as many as most people would like to think\n\n2:23:04.220 --> 2:23:09.140\n is my view because the idea that there is a trajectory\n\n2:23:09.140 --> 2:23:14.140\n going from simple, simple cellular life like bacteria\n\n2:23:14.660 --> 2:23:16.260\n all the way through to humans.\n\n2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:19.980\n It seems to me there's some big gaps along that way\n\n2:23:19.980 --> 2:23:23.380\n that the eukaryotic cell, the complex cell that we have\n\n2:23:23.380 --> 2:23:27.260\n is the biggest of them, but also photosynthesis is another.\n\n2:23:27.260 --> 2:23:30.260\n The other, another interesting gap is a long gap\n\n2:23:30.260 --> 2:23:33.140\n from the origin of the eukaryotic cell\n\n2:23:33.140 --> 2:23:34.260\n to the first animals.\n\n2:23:34.260 --> 2:23:37.820\n That was about a billion years, maybe more than that.\n\n2:23:38.980 --> 2:23:41.380\n A long delay in when oxygen began\n\n2:23:41.380 --> 2:23:42.980\n to accumulate in the atmosphere.\n\n2:23:42.980 --> 2:23:44.740\n So from the first appearance of oxygen\n\n2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:47.420\n in the Great Oxidation Event to enough for animals\n\n2:23:47.420 --> 2:23:50.420\n to respire, it was close to two billion years.\n\n2:23:52.220 --> 2:23:53.300\n Why so long?\n\n2:23:53.300 --> 2:23:54.980\n It seems to be planetary factors.\n\n2:23:54.980 --> 2:23:57.220\n It seems to be geology as much as in anything else.\n\n2:23:57.220 --> 2:24:00.700\n And we don't really know what was going on.\n\n2:24:00.700 --> 2:24:04.820\n So the idea that there's a kind of an inevitable march\n\n2:24:04.820 --> 2:24:09.820\n towards complexity and sentient life,\n\n2:24:10.580 --> 2:24:12.220\n I don't think is right.\n\n2:24:12.220 --> 2:24:14.620\n Doesn't, not to say it's not gonna happen,\n\n2:24:14.620 --> 2:24:17.700\n but I think it's not gonna happen often.\n\n2:24:17.700 --> 2:24:19.180\n So if you think of Earth,\n\n2:24:19.180 --> 2:24:22.900\n given the geological constraints and all that kind of stuff,\n\n2:24:25.260 --> 2:24:28.260\n do you have a sense that life, complex life,\n\n2:24:28.260 --> 2:24:30.420\n intelligent life happened really quickly on Earth\n\n2:24:30.420 --> 2:24:31.740\n or really long?\n\n2:24:31.740 --> 2:24:34.100\n So just to get a sense of,\n\n2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:38.740\n are you more sort of saying that it's very unlikely\n\n2:24:38.740 --> 2:24:42.300\n to get the kind of conditions required to create humans?\n\n2:24:42.300 --> 2:24:44.900\n Or is it, even if you have the condition,\n\n2:24:44.900 --> 2:24:46.820\n it's just statistically difficult?\n\n2:24:46.820 --> 2:24:48.860\n I think the, I mean, the problem,\n\n2:24:48.860 --> 2:24:51.220\n the single great problem at the center of all of that,\n\n2:24:51.220 --> 2:24:53.340\n to my mind, is the origin of the eukaryotic cell,\n\n2:24:53.340 --> 2:24:55.100\n which happened once and without eukaryotes,\n\n2:24:55.100 --> 2:24:56.780\n nothing else would have happened.\n\n2:24:56.780 --> 2:24:58.900\n And that is something that.\n\n2:24:58.900 --> 2:25:01.060\n That's because you're saying it's super important,\n\n2:25:01.060 --> 2:25:02.420\n the eukaryotes, but.\n\n2:25:02.420 --> 2:25:05.700\n I'm saying a tantamount to saying that it is impossible\n\n2:25:05.700 --> 2:25:07.740\n to build something as complex as a human being\n\n2:25:07.740 --> 2:25:09.300\n from bacterial cells.\n\n2:25:09.300 --> 2:25:11.900\n Totally agree in some deep fundamental way.\n\n2:25:11.900 --> 2:25:14.780\n But it's just like a one cell going inside another.\n\n2:25:14.780 --> 2:25:17.140\n Is that so difficult to get to work right?\n\n2:25:17.140 --> 2:25:18.340\n That like.\n\n2:25:18.340 --> 2:25:20.620\n Well, again, it happened once.\n\n2:25:21.660 --> 2:25:25.260\n And if you think about, if you think,\n\n2:25:25.260 --> 2:25:27.940\n I mean, I'm in a minority view in this position.\n\n2:25:27.940 --> 2:25:30.580\n Most biologists probably wouldn't agree with me anyway.\n\n2:25:30.580 --> 2:25:32.860\n But if you think about the starting point,\n\n2:25:32.860 --> 2:25:35.740\n we've got a simple cell, it's an alkyl cell,\n\n2:25:35.740 --> 2:25:36.860\n we can be fairly sure about that.\n\n2:25:36.860 --> 2:25:39.220\n So it looks a lot like a bacterium,\n\n2:25:39.220 --> 2:25:42.420\n but is in fact from this other domain of life.\n\n2:25:42.420 --> 2:25:44.300\n So it looks a lot like a bacterial cell.\n\n2:25:44.300 --> 2:25:46.220\n That means it doesn't have anything.\n\n2:25:46.220 --> 2:25:47.460\n It doesn't have a nucleus.\n\n2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:50.220\n It doesn't really have complex endomembrane.\n\n2:25:50.220 --> 2:25:53.700\n It has a little bit of stuff, but not that much.\n\n2:25:53.700 --> 2:25:56.220\n And it takes up an endosymbiont.\n\n2:25:56.220 --> 2:25:58.940\n So what happens next?\n\n2:25:58.940 --> 2:26:00.980\n And the answer is basically everything\n\n2:26:00.980 --> 2:26:02.780\n to do with complexity.\n\n2:26:02.780 --> 2:26:04.940\n To me, there's a beautiful paradox here.\n\n2:26:04.940 --> 2:26:07.300\n Plants and animals and fungi\n\n2:26:08.420 --> 2:26:10.900\n all have exactly the same type of cell.\n\n2:26:11.900 --> 2:26:14.820\n But they all have really different ways of living.\n\n2:26:14.820 --> 2:26:19.180\n So a plant cell, it's photosynthetic.\n\n2:26:19.180 --> 2:26:22.180\n They started out as algae in the oceans and so on.\n\n2:26:22.180 --> 2:26:24.700\n So think of algal blooms, single cell things.\n\n2:26:24.700 --> 2:26:29.700\n The basic cell structure that it's built from\n\n2:26:30.260 --> 2:26:33.780\n is exactly the same with a couple of small differences.\n\n2:26:33.780 --> 2:26:35.140\n It's got chloroplasts as well.\n\n2:26:35.140 --> 2:26:35.980\n It's got a vacuole.\n\n2:26:35.980 --> 2:26:36.820\n It's got a cell wall.\n\n2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:37.660\n But that's about it.\n\n2:26:37.660 --> 2:26:39.580\n Pretty much everything else is exactly the same\n\n2:26:39.580 --> 2:26:41.260\n in a plant cell and an animal cell.\n\n2:26:42.260 --> 2:26:44.340\n And yet the ways of life are completely different.\n\n2:26:44.340 --> 2:26:47.700\n So this cell structure did not evolve\n\n2:26:47.700 --> 2:26:49.460\n in response to different ways of life,\n\n2:26:49.460 --> 2:26:50.300\n different environments.\n\n2:26:50.300 --> 2:26:51.900\n I'm in the ocean doing photosynthesis.\n\n2:26:51.900 --> 2:26:54.780\n I'm on land running around as part of an animal.\n\n2:26:54.780 --> 2:26:56.540\n I'm a fungus in a soil,\n\n2:26:57.660 --> 2:27:02.220\n spreading out long shoots into whatever it may be, mycelium.\n\n2:27:02.220 --> 2:27:05.660\n So they all have the same underlying cell structure.\n\n2:27:05.660 --> 2:27:06.980\n Why?\n\n2:27:06.980 --> 2:27:10.380\n Almost certainly it was driven by adaptation\n\n2:27:10.380 --> 2:27:11.740\n to the internal environment,\n\n2:27:11.740 --> 2:27:13.780\n to having these pesky endosymbionts\n\n2:27:13.780 --> 2:27:16.900\n that forced all kinds of change on the host cell.\n\n2:27:16.900 --> 2:27:18.700\n Now, in one way you could see that as a really good thing\n\n2:27:18.700 --> 2:27:21.140\n because it may be that there's some inevitability\n\n2:27:21.140 --> 2:27:23.260\n to this process that as soon as you got endosymbionts,\n\n2:27:23.260 --> 2:27:25.100\n you're more or less bound to go in that direction.\n\n2:27:25.100 --> 2:27:27.700\n Or it could be that there's a huge fluke about it\n\n2:27:27.700 --> 2:27:29.140\n and it's almost certain to go wrong\n\n2:27:29.140 --> 2:27:31.380\n in just about every case possible.\n\n2:27:31.380 --> 2:27:34.180\n That the conflict will lead to effectively war\n\n2:27:34.180 --> 2:27:36.260\n leading to death and extinction.\n\n2:27:36.260 --> 2:27:37.980\n And it simply doesn't work out.\n\n2:27:37.980 --> 2:27:39.420\n So maybe it happened millions of times\n\n2:27:39.420 --> 2:27:40.620\n and it went wrong every time.\n\n2:27:40.620 --> 2:27:43.540\n Or maybe it only happened once and it worked out\n\n2:27:43.540 --> 2:27:44.780\n because it was inevitable.\n\n2:27:44.780 --> 2:27:47.300\n And actually we simply do not know enough now\n\n2:27:47.300 --> 2:27:49.180\n to say which of those two possibilities is true.\n\n2:27:49.180 --> 2:27:50.900\n But both of them are a bit grim.\n\n2:27:50.900 --> 2:27:54.100\n But you're leaning towards,\n\n2:27:54.100 --> 2:27:56.740\n we just got really lucky in that one leap.\n\n2:27:56.740 --> 2:27:59.580\n Like we got, so do you have a sense\n\n2:27:59.580 --> 2:28:04.580\n that our galaxy, for example, has just maybe millions\n\n2:28:04.580 --> 2:28:06.540\n of planets with bacteria living on it?\n\n2:28:06.540 --> 2:28:09.700\n I would expect billions, tens of billions of planets\n\n2:28:09.700 --> 2:28:11.460\n with bacteria living on it practically.\n\n2:28:11.460 --> 2:28:16.460\n I mean, there's probably what, five to 10 planets per star\n\n2:28:16.460 --> 2:28:18.380\n of which I would hope that at least one\n\n2:28:18.380 --> 2:28:19.700\n would have bacteria on.\n\n2:28:20.740 --> 2:28:23.380\n So I expect bacteria to be very common.\n\n2:28:23.380 --> 2:28:25.620\n I simply can't put a number otherwise.\n\n2:28:25.620 --> 2:28:27.620\n I mean, I expect it will happen elsewhere.\n\n2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:29.660\n It's not that I think we're living\n\n2:28:29.660 --> 2:28:31.380\n in a completely empty universe.\n\n2:28:31.380 --> 2:28:35.620\n But I think that it's not gonna happen inevitably.\n\n2:28:35.620 --> 2:28:37.580\n And there's something, it wasn't,\n\n2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:41.660\n that's not the only problem with complex life on earth.\n\n2:28:41.660 --> 2:28:44.060\n I mentioned oxygen and animals and so on as well.\n\n2:28:44.060 --> 2:28:46.100\n And even humans, we came along very late.\n\n2:28:46.100 --> 2:28:49.260\n You go back 5 million years and would we be that impressed\n\n2:28:49.260 --> 2:28:52.100\n if we came across a planet full of giraffes?\n\n2:28:52.100 --> 2:28:53.940\n I mean, you'd think, hey, there's life here\n\n2:28:53.940 --> 2:28:56.140\n and it's a nice planet to colonize or something.\n\n2:28:56.140 --> 2:28:58.700\n We wouldn't think, oh, let's try and have a conversation\n\n2:28:58.700 --> 2:29:00.420\n with this giraffe.\n\n2:29:00.420 --> 2:29:04.220\n Yeah, I'm not sure what exactly we would think.\n\n2:29:04.220 --> 2:29:07.940\n I'm not exactly sure what makes humans so interesting\n\n2:29:07.940 --> 2:29:11.700\n from an alien perspective or how they would notice.\n\n2:29:11.700 --> 2:29:12.940\n I'll talk to you about cities too\n\n2:29:12.940 --> 2:29:14.260\n because that's an interesting perspective\n\n2:29:14.260 --> 2:29:16.720\n of how to look at human civilization.\n\n2:29:18.180 --> 2:29:20.500\n But your sense, I mean, of course you don't know,\n\n2:29:20.500 --> 2:29:25.420\n but it's an interesting world, it's an interesting galaxy,\n\n2:29:25.420 --> 2:29:27.540\n it's an interesting universe to live in\n\n2:29:27.540 --> 2:29:31.260\n that's just like every sun,\n\n2:29:31.260 --> 2:29:36.260\n like 90% of solar systems have bacteria in it.\n\n2:29:39.940 --> 2:29:44.940\n Imagine that world and the galaxy maybe has\n\n2:29:46.220 --> 2:29:50.340\n just a handful if not one intelligent civilization.\n\n2:29:51.260 --> 2:29:53.020\n That's a wild world.\n\n2:29:53.020 --> 2:29:55.820\n I didn't even think about that world.\n\n2:29:55.820 --> 2:29:58.820\n There's a kind of thought that,\n\n2:29:58.820 --> 2:30:00.860\n like one of the reasons it would be so exciting\n\n2:30:00.860 --> 2:30:04.180\n to find life on Mars or Titan or whatever\n\n2:30:04.180 --> 2:30:05.860\n is like if its life is elsewhere,\n\n2:30:05.860 --> 2:30:10.860\n then surely, statistically, that life,\n\n2:30:10.980 --> 2:30:14.740\n no matter how unlikely you query as multicellular organisms,\n\n2:30:14.740 --> 2:30:19.740\n sex, violence, what else is extremely difficult?\n\n2:30:19.740 --> 2:30:24.740\n I mean, photosynthesis, figuring out some machinery\n\n2:30:25.140 --> 2:30:27.500\n that involves the chemistry and the environment\n\n2:30:27.500 --> 2:30:30.620\n to allow the building up of complex organisms,\n\n2:30:30.620 --> 2:30:32.900\n surely that would arise.\n\n2:30:32.900 --> 2:30:35.180\n But man, I don't know how I would feel\n\n2:30:35.180 --> 2:30:38.100\n about just bacteria everywhere.\n\n2:30:38.100 --> 2:30:40.700\n Well, it would be depressing if it was true.\n\n2:30:40.700 --> 2:30:42.820\n I suppose depressing, I don't think, I don't.\n\n2:30:42.820 --> 2:30:43.940\n I don't know what's more depressing,\n\n2:30:43.940 --> 2:30:46.580\n bacteria everywhere or nothing everywhere.\n\n2:30:46.580 --> 2:30:48.660\n Yes, either of them are chilling.\n\n2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:49.980\n Yeah.\n\n2:30:49.980 --> 2:30:51.860\n But whether it's chilling or not,\n\n2:30:51.860 --> 2:30:55.900\n I don't think should force us to change our view\n\n2:30:55.900 --> 2:30:57.700\n about whether it's real or not.\n\n2:30:57.700 --> 2:30:58.540\n Yes.\n\n2:30:58.540 --> 2:31:00.340\n And what I'm saying may or may not be true.\n\n2:31:00.340 --> 2:31:02.940\n So how would you feel if we discovered life on Mars?\n\n2:31:03.820 --> 2:31:04.660\n Absolutely.\n\n2:31:04.660 --> 2:31:07.700\n It sounds like you would be less excited than some others\n\n2:31:07.700 --> 2:31:08.940\n because you're like, well.\n\n2:31:08.940 --> 2:31:10.420\n What I would be most interested in\n\n2:31:10.420 --> 2:31:12.100\n is how similar to life on Earth it would be.\n\n2:31:12.100 --> 2:31:13.900\n It would actually turn into quite a subtle problem\n\n2:31:13.900 --> 2:31:18.900\n because the likelihood of life having gone to and fro\n\n2:31:20.140 --> 2:31:23.980\n between Mars and the Earth is quite,\n\n2:31:23.980 --> 2:31:27.340\n I wouldn't say high, but it's not low, it's quite feasible.\n\n2:31:27.340 --> 2:31:29.420\n And so if we found life on Mars\n\n2:31:29.420 --> 2:31:32.420\n and it had very similar genetic code,\n\n2:31:32.420 --> 2:31:34.380\n but it was slightly different,\n\n2:31:34.380 --> 2:31:36.380\n most people would interpret that immediately\n\n2:31:36.380 --> 2:31:38.860\n as evidence that they've been transit one way or the other\n\n2:31:38.860 --> 2:31:41.380\n and that it was a common origin of life on Mars\n\n2:31:41.380 --> 2:31:43.460\n or on the Earth and it went one way or the other way.\n\n2:31:43.460 --> 2:31:45.620\n The other way to see that question though would be to say,\n\n2:31:45.620 --> 2:31:47.860\n well, actually the beginnings of life\n\n2:31:47.860 --> 2:31:50.700\n lie in deterministic chemistry and thermodynamics,\n\n2:31:50.700 --> 2:31:53.860\n starting with the most likely abundant materials,\n\n2:31:53.860 --> 2:31:57.580\n CO2 and water and a wet rocky planet.\n\n2:31:57.580 --> 2:31:59.980\n And Mars was wet and rocky at the beginning.\n\n2:31:59.980 --> 2:32:02.100\n And will, I won't say inevitably,\n\n2:32:02.100 --> 2:32:04.060\n but potentially almost inevitably come up\n\n2:32:04.060 --> 2:32:06.100\n with a genetic code which is not very far away\n\n2:32:06.100 --> 2:32:08.260\n from the genetic code that we already have.\n\n2:32:09.540 --> 2:32:11.820\n So we see subtle differences in the genetic code.\n\n2:32:11.820 --> 2:32:12.660\n What does it mean?\n\n2:32:12.660 --> 2:32:14.820\n Could be very difficult to interpret.\n\n2:32:14.820 --> 2:32:17.380\n Is it possible, do you think, to tell the difference\n\n2:32:17.380 --> 2:32:19.980\n of something that truly originated?\n\n2:32:19.980 --> 2:32:23.180\n I think if the stereochemistry was different,\n\n2:32:23.180 --> 2:32:25.500\n we have sugars, for example, that are the L form\n\n2:32:25.500 --> 2:32:30.500\n or the D form and we have D sugars and L amino acids\n\n2:32:31.460 --> 2:32:32.940\n right across all of life.\n\n2:32:32.940 --> 2:32:37.940\n But lipids, the bacteria have one stereoisomer\n\n2:32:38.820 --> 2:32:42.420\n and the bacteria have the other, the opposite stereoisomer.\n\n2:32:42.420 --> 2:32:46.460\n So it's perfectly possible to use one or the other one.\n\n2:32:46.460 --> 2:32:48.540\n And the same would almost certainly go for,\n\n2:32:48.540 --> 2:32:53.540\n and I think George Church has been trying to make life\n\n2:32:53.780 --> 2:32:55.940\n based on the opposite stereoisomer.\n\n2:32:56.820 --> 2:32:59.380\n So it's perfectly possible to do and it will work.\n\n2:33:00.660 --> 2:33:02.380\n And if we were to find life on Mars\n\n2:33:02.380 --> 2:33:03.940\n that was using the opposite stereoisomer,\n\n2:33:03.940 --> 2:33:06.180\n that would be unequivocal evidence\n\n2:33:06.180 --> 2:33:08.980\n that life had started independently there.\n\n2:33:08.980 --> 2:33:13.340\n So hopefully the life we find will be on Titan and Europa\n\n2:33:13.340 --> 2:33:15.660\n or something like that where it's less likely\n\n2:33:15.660 --> 2:33:18.220\n that we shared and it's harsher conditions\n\n2:33:18.220 --> 2:33:20.820\n so there's gonna be weirder kind of life.\n\n2:33:20.820 --> 2:33:23.820\n I wouldn't count on that because if life started\n\n2:33:23.820 --> 2:33:28.660\n in deep sea hydrothermal vents here, that's pretty harsh.\n\n2:33:28.660 --> 2:33:29.940\n So Titan is different.\n\n2:33:29.940 --> 2:33:32.060\n Europa is probably quite similar to Earth\n\n2:33:32.060 --> 2:33:34.500\n in the sense that we're dealing with an ocean,\n\n2:33:34.500 --> 2:33:38.820\n some acidic ocean there, as the early Earth would have been.\n\n2:33:38.820 --> 2:33:41.380\n And it almost certainly has hydrothermal systems.\n\n2:33:41.380 --> 2:33:43.060\n Same with Enceladus.\n\n2:33:43.060 --> 2:33:44.940\n We can tell that from these plumes\n\n2:33:44.940 --> 2:33:46.940\n coming from the surface through the ice.\n\n2:33:46.940 --> 2:33:48.060\n We know there's a liquid ocean\n\n2:33:48.060 --> 2:33:50.580\n and we can tell roughly what the chemistry is.\n\n2:33:51.420 --> 2:33:53.660\n For Titan, we're dealing with liquid methane\n\n2:33:53.660 --> 2:33:54.500\n and things like that.\n\n2:33:54.500 --> 2:33:56.220\n So that would really, if there really is life there,\n\n2:33:56.220 --> 2:33:58.020\n it would really have to be very, very different\n\n2:33:58.020 --> 2:34:00.980\n to anything that we know on Earth.\n\n2:34:00.980 --> 2:34:02.980\n So the hard leap, the hardest leap,\n\n2:34:02.980 --> 2:34:07.980\n the most important leap is from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.\n\n2:34:07.980 --> 2:34:09.500\n It's eukaryotic.\n\n2:34:09.500 --> 2:34:12.260\n What's the second, if we're ranking?\n\n2:34:12.260 --> 2:34:17.260\n What's the, you gave a lot of emphasis on photosynthesis.\n\n2:34:17.460 --> 2:34:20.500\n Yeah, and that would be my second one, I think.\n\n2:34:20.500 --> 2:34:22.620\n But it's not so much, I mean,\n\n2:34:22.620 --> 2:34:25.220\n photosynthesis is part of the problem.\n\n2:34:25.220 --> 2:34:26.820\n It's a difficult thing to do.\n\n2:34:26.820 --> 2:34:29.980\n Again, we know it happened once.\n\n2:34:29.980 --> 2:34:31.740\n We don't know why it happened once.\n\n2:34:31.740 --> 2:34:36.740\n But the fact that it was kind of taken on board completely\n\n2:34:39.820 --> 2:34:43.060\n by plants and algae and so on as chloroplasts\n\n2:34:44.020 --> 2:34:47.260\n and did very well in completely different environments\n\n2:34:47.260 --> 2:34:50.020\n and then on land and whatever else seems to suggest\n\n2:34:50.020 --> 2:34:53.540\n that there's no problem with exploring,\n\n2:34:53.540 --> 2:34:55.060\n whether you could have a separate origin\n\n2:34:55.060 --> 2:34:56.780\n that explored this whole domain over there\n\n2:34:56.780 --> 2:34:58.580\n that the bacteria had never gone into.\n\n2:34:58.580 --> 2:35:00.900\n So that kind of says that the reason\n\n2:35:00.900 --> 2:35:02.220\n that it only happened once is probably\n\n2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:04.980\n because it's difficult, because the wiring is difficult.\n\n2:35:05.980 --> 2:35:10.380\n But then it happened at least 2.2 billion years ago,\n\n2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:14.380\n right before the GOE, maybe as long as 3 billion years ago,\n\n2:35:14.380 --> 2:35:16.780\n when there are, some people say there are whiffs of oxygen,\n\n2:35:16.780 --> 2:35:18.580\n there's just kind of traces in the fossil\n\n2:35:18.580 --> 2:35:20.500\n in the geochemical record that say,\n\n2:35:20.500 --> 2:35:22.260\n maybe there was a bit of oxygen then.\n\n2:35:22.260 --> 2:35:23.740\n That's really disputed.\n\n2:35:23.740 --> 2:35:25.380\n Some people say it goes all the way back\n\n2:35:25.380 --> 2:35:28.340\n four billion years ago and then it's gone.\n\n2:35:28.340 --> 2:35:32.460\n And the common ancestor of life on Earth was photosynthetic.\n\n2:35:32.460 --> 2:35:34.780\n So immediately you've got groups of people\n\n2:35:34.780 --> 2:35:37.460\n who disagree over a two billion year period of time\n\n2:35:37.460 --> 2:35:39.620\n about when it started.\n\n2:35:41.020 --> 2:35:45.620\n But let's take the latest date when it's unequivocal,\n\n2:35:45.620 --> 2:35:47.380\n that's 2.2 billion years ago,\n\n2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:49.980\n through to around about the time of the Cambrian explosion\n\n2:35:49.980 --> 2:35:53.140\n when oxygen levels definitely got close to modern levels,\n\n2:35:54.060 --> 2:35:56.660\n which was around about 550 million years ago.\n\n2:35:56.660 --> 2:36:00.060\n So we've gone more than one and a half billion years\n\n2:36:00.060 --> 2:36:01.660\n where the Earth was in stasis.\n\n2:36:03.060 --> 2:36:04.860\n Nothing much changed.\n\n2:36:04.860 --> 2:36:07.020\n It's known as the boring billion, in fact.\n\n2:36:08.580 --> 2:36:10.740\n Probably stuff was, that was when eukaryotes arose\n\n2:36:10.740 --> 2:36:12.340\n somewhere in there, but it's...\n\n2:36:15.420 --> 2:36:17.940\n So this idea that the world is constantly changing,\n\n2:36:17.940 --> 2:36:19.420\n that we're constantly evolving,\n\n2:36:19.420 --> 2:36:22.020\n that we're moving up some ramp is a very human idea.\n\n2:36:22.020 --> 2:36:27.020\n But in reality, there are kind of tipping points\n\n2:36:30.500 --> 2:36:35.020\n to a new stable equilibrium where the cells\n\n2:36:35.020 --> 2:36:37.540\n that are producing oxygen are precisely counterbalanced\n\n2:36:37.540 --> 2:36:39.700\n by the cells that are consuming that oxygen,\n\n2:36:39.700 --> 2:36:42.820\n which is why it's 21% now and has been that way\n\n2:36:42.820 --> 2:36:44.420\n for hundreds of millions of years.\n\n2:36:44.420 --> 2:36:46.660\n We have a very precise balance.\n\n2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:48.820\n You go through a tipping point and you don't know\n\n2:36:48.820 --> 2:36:51.580\n where the next stable state's gonna be,\n\n2:36:51.580 --> 2:36:54.140\n but it can be a long way from here.\n\n2:36:54.140 --> 2:36:57.180\n And so if we change the world with global warming,\n\n2:36:57.180 --> 2:36:58.340\n there will be a tipping point.\n\n2:36:58.340 --> 2:37:00.020\n The question is where and when,\n\n2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:01.820\n and what's the next stable state?\n\n2:37:01.820 --> 2:37:03.660\n It may be uninhabitable to us.\n\n2:37:03.660 --> 2:37:07.020\n It'll be habitable to life, for sure.\n\n2:37:07.020 --> 2:37:08.940\n But there may be something like the Permian extinction\n\n2:37:08.940 --> 2:37:11.420\n where 95% of species go extinct\n\n2:37:11.420 --> 2:37:13.900\n and there's a five to 10 million year gap\n\n2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:16.780\n and then life recovers, but without humans.\n\n2:37:16.780 --> 2:37:18.980\n And the question statistically, well, without humans,\n\n2:37:18.980 --> 2:37:21.980\n but statistically does that ultimately lead\n\n2:37:21.980 --> 2:37:24.940\n to greater complexity, more interesting life,\n\n2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:25.780\n more intelligent life?\n\n2:37:25.780 --> 2:37:29.700\n Well, after the first appearance of oxygen with the GOE,\n\n2:37:29.700 --> 2:37:31.300\n there was a tipping point which led\n\n2:37:31.300 --> 2:37:33.420\n to a longterm stable state that was equivalent\n\n2:37:33.420 --> 2:37:36.260\n to the Black Sea today, which is to say oxygenated\n\n2:37:36.260 --> 2:37:38.740\n at the very surface and stagnant, sterile,\n\n2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:42.260\n not sterile, but sulfurous, lower down.\n\n2:37:43.660 --> 2:37:47.940\n And that was stable certainly around the continental margins\n\n2:37:47.940 --> 2:37:50.180\n for more than a billion years.\n\n2:37:50.180 --> 2:37:52.260\n It was not a state that led to progression\n\n2:37:52.260 --> 2:37:53.340\n in an obvious way.\n\n2:37:55.500 --> 2:37:58.220\n Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to think about evolution,\n\n2:37:58.220 --> 2:38:00.020\n like what leads to stable states\n\n2:38:01.300 --> 2:38:03.900\n and how often are\n\n2:38:05.740 --> 2:38:10.060\n evolutionary pressures emerging from the environment.\n\n2:38:11.260 --> 2:38:13.660\n So maybe other planets are able\n\n2:38:13.660 --> 2:38:16.340\n to create evolutionary pressures, chemical pressures,\n\n2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:18.460\n whatever, some kind of pressure that say,\n\n2:38:18.460 --> 2:38:20.260\n you're screwed unless you get your shit together\n\n2:38:20.260 --> 2:38:25.260\n in the next like 10,000 years, like a lot of pressure.\n\n2:38:26.180 --> 2:38:29.100\n It seems like Earth, like the boring building\n\n2:38:29.100 --> 2:38:31.300\n might be explained in two ways.\n\n2:38:31.300 --> 2:38:34.860\n One is super difficult to take any kind of next step.\n\n2:38:34.860 --> 2:38:37.260\n And the second way it could be explained\n\n2:38:37.260 --> 2:38:39.140\n is there's no reason to take the next step.\n\n2:38:39.140 --> 2:38:41.860\n No, I think there is no reason, but at the end of it,\n\n2:38:41.860 --> 2:38:44.100\n there was a snowball Earth.\n\n2:38:44.100 --> 2:38:46.940\n So there was a planetary catastrophe on a huge scale\n\n2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:51.940\n where the ice was, the sea was frozen at the equator.\n\n2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:58.420\n And that forced change in one way or another.\n\n2:38:58.420 --> 2:39:00.380\n It's not long after that, 100 million years,\n\n2:39:00.380 --> 2:39:02.220\n perhaps after that, so not a short time,\n\n2:39:02.220 --> 2:39:03.740\n but this is when we begin to see animals.\n\n2:39:03.740 --> 2:39:06.620\n There was a shift again, another tipping point\n\n2:39:06.620 --> 2:39:08.020\n that led to catastrophic change\n\n2:39:08.020 --> 2:39:10.580\n that led to a takeoff then.\n\n2:39:10.580 --> 2:39:13.420\n We don't really know why, but one of the reasons\n\n2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:18.420\n why that I discuss in the book is about sulfate\n\n2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:20.420\n being washed into the oceans,\n\n2:39:20.420 --> 2:39:22.980\n which sounds incredibly parochial.\n\n2:39:22.980 --> 2:39:27.500\n But the issue is, I mean, what the data is showing,\n\n2:39:27.500 --> 2:39:30.180\n we can track roughly how oxygen was going\n\n2:39:30.180 --> 2:39:35.180\n into the atmosphere from carbon isotopes.\n\n2:39:35.180 --> 2:39:37.420\n So there's two main isotopes of carbon\n\n2:39:37.420 --> 2:39:38.780\n that we need to think about here.\n\n2:39:38.780 --> 2:39:41.980\n One is carbon 12, 99% of carbon is carbon 12.\n\n2:39:41.980 --> 2:39:44.820\n And then 1% of carbon is carbon 13,\n\n2:39:44.820 --> 2:39:46.060\n which is a stable isotope.\n\n2:39:46.060 --> 2:39:48.980\n And then there's carbon 14, which is a trivial radioactive,\n\n2:39:48.980 --> 2:39:50.820\n it's trivial in amount.\n\n2:39:50.820 --> 2:39:53.180\n So carbon 13 is 1%.\n\n2:39:53.180 --> 2:39:56.460\n And life and enzymes generally,\n\n2:39:56.460 --> 2:40:00.020\n you can think of carbon atoms as little balls\n\n2:40:00.020 --> 2:40:01.860\n bouncing around, ping pong balls bouncing around.\n\n2:40:01.860 --> 2:40:04.340\n Carbon 12 moves a little bit faster than carbon 13\n\n2:40:04.340 --> 2:40:06.700\n because it's lighter and it's more likely\n\n2:40:06.700 --> 2:40:08.620\n to encounter an enzyme.\n\n2:40:08.620 --> 2:40:11.900\n And so it's more likely to be fixed into organic matter.\n\n2:40:11.900 --> 2:40:13.380\n And so organic matter is enriched.\n\n2:40:13.380 --> 2:40:14.500\n And this is just an observation.\n\n2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:17.660\n It's enriched in carbon 12 by a few percent\n\n2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:19.060\n compared to carbon 13,\n\n2:40:19.060 --> 2:40:21.660\n relative to what you would expect if it was just equal.\n\n2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:26.660\n And if you then bury organic matter as coal\n\n2:40:26.780 --> 2:40:30.260\n or oil or whatever it may be,\n\n2:40:30.260 --> 2:40:31.580\n then it's no longer oxidized.\n\n2:40:31.580 --> 2:40:35.180\n So some oxygen remains leftover in the atmosphere.\n\n2:40:35.180 --> 2:40:37.460\n And that's how oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere.\n\n2:40:37.460 --> 2:40:39.100\n And you can work out historically\n\n2:40:39.100 --> 2:40:40.980\n how much oxygen there must've been in the atmosphere\n\n2:40:40.980 --> 2:40:43.620\n by how much carbon was being buried.\n\n2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:45.100\n And you think, well, how can we possibly know\n\n2:40:45.100 --> 2:40:46.540\n how much carbon was being buried?\n\n2:40:46.540 --> 2:40:49.340\n And the answer is, well, if you're burying carbon 12,\n\n2:40:49.340 --> 2:40:52.100\n what you're leaving behind is more carbon 13 in the oceans\n\n2:40:52.100 --> 2:40:54.380\n and that precipitates out into limestone.\n\n2:40:54.380 --> 2:40:56.420\n So you can look at limestones over these ages\n\n2:40:56.420 --> 2:40:59.140\n and work out what's the carbon 13 signal.\n\n2:40:59.140 --> 2:41:00.980\n And that gives you a kind of a feedback\n\n2:41:00.980 --> 2:41:03.540\n on what the oxygen content.\n\n2:41:03.540 --> 2:41:05.180\n Right before the Cambrian explosion,\n\n2:41:05.180 --> 2:41:08.780\n there was what's called a negative isotope anomaly excursion,\n\n2:41:08.780 --> 2:41:10.860\n which is basically the carbon 13 goes down\n\n2:41:10.860 --> 2:41:12.740\n by a massive amount and then back up again\n\n2:41:12.740 --> 2:41:13.860\n 10 million years later.\n\n2:41:15.500 --> 2:41:18.980\n And what that seems to be saying is the amount\n\n2:41:18.980 --> 2:41:23.980\n of carbon 12 in the oceans was disappearing,\n\n2:41:26.140 --> 2:41:28.580\n which is to say it was being oxidized.\n\n2:41:30.380 --> 2:41:33.180\n And if it's being oxidized, it's consuming oxygen.\n\n2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:36.340\n And that should, so a big carbon 13 signal says\n\n2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:39.940\n the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 is really going down,\n\n2:41:39.940 --> 2:41:42.900\n which means there's much more carbon 12\n\n2:41:42.900 --> 2:41:44.300\n being taken out and being oxidized.\n\n2:41:44.300 --> 2:41:46.260\n Sorry, this is getting too complex, but.\n\n2:41:46.260 --> 2:41:49.740\n Well, it's a good way to estimate the amount of oxygen.\n\n2:41:49.740 --> 2:41:51.580\n If you calculate the amount of oxygen\n\n2:41:51.580 --> 2:41:53.940\n based on the assumption that all this carbon 12\n\n2:41:53.940 --> 2:41:56.180\n that's being taken out is being oxidized by oxygen,\n\n2:41:56.180 --> 2:41:58.060\n the answer is all the oxygen in the atmosphere\n\n2:41:58.060 --> 2:42:00.020\n gets stripped out, there is none left.\n\n2:42:01.100 --> 2:42:03.420\n And yet the rest of the geological indicators say,\n\n2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:06.180\n no, there's oxygen in the atmosphere.\n\n2:42:06.180 --> 2:42:07.620\n So it's a kind of a paradox.\n\n2:42:07.620 --> 2:42:09.860\n And the only way to explain this paradox\n\n2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:12.580\n just on mass balance of how much stuff is in the air,\n\n2:42:12.580 --> 2:42:15.300\n how much stuff is in the oceans and so on,\n\n2:42:15.300 --> 2:42:18.580\n is to assume that oxygen was not the oxygen,\n\n2:42:18.580 --> 2:42:19.700\n it was sulfate.\n\n2:42:19.700 --> 2:42:22.500\n Sulfate was being washed into the oceans.\n\n2:42:22.500 --> 2:42:24.740\n It's used as an electron acceptor\n\n2:42:24.740 --> 2:42:26.020\n by sulfate reducing bacteria,\n\n2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:28.300\n just as we use oxygen as an electron acceptor.\n\n2:42:28.300 --> 2:42:31.780\n So they pass their electrons to sulfate instead of oxygen.\n\n2:42:31.780 --> 2:42:32.780\n And. Bacteria did.\n\n2:42:32.780 --> 2:42:34.020\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n2:42:34.020 --> 2:42:36.540\n So these are bacteria.\n\n2:42:36.540 --> 2:42:41.300\n So they're oxidizing carbon, organic carbon with sulfate,\n\n2:42:41.300 --> 2:42:43.340\n passing the electrons onto sulfate,\n\n2:42:43.340 --> 2:42:47.580\n that reacts with iron to form iron pyrite or fool's gold,\n\n2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:51.020\n sinks down to the bottom, gets buried out of the system.\n\n2:42:51.020 --> 2:42:53.940\n And this can account for the mass balance.\n\n2:42:53.940 --> 2:42:55.620\n So why does it matter?\n\n2:42:55.620 --> 2:42:58.020\n It matters because what it says is\n\n2:42:58.020 --> 2:43:00.020\n there was a chance event,\n\n2:43:00.020 --> 2:43:03.220\n tectonically there was a lot of sulfate sitting on land\n\n2:43:03.220 --> 2:43:06.580\n as some kind of mineral.\n\n2:43:06.580 --> 2:43:10.340\n So calcium sulfate minerals, for example, are evaporitic.\n\n2:43:11.300 --> 2:43:13.860\n And because there happened to be\n\n2:43:13.860 --> 2:43:18.340\n some continental collisions, mountain building,\n\n2:43:18.340 --> 2:43:20.820\n the sulfate was pushed up the side of a mountain\n\n2:43:20.820 --> 2:43:22.820\n and happened to get washed into the ocean.\n\n2:43:24.140 --> 2:43:26.460\n Yeah, so I wonder how many happy accidents\n\n2:43:26.460 --> 2:43:27.420\n like that are possible.\n\n2:43:27.420 --> 2:43:28.780\n Statistically, it's really hard.\n\n2:43:28.780 --> 2:43:30.820\n Maybe you can rule that in statistically,\n\n2:43:30.820 --> 2:43:34.100\n but this is the course of life on earth.\n\n2:43:34.100 --> 2:43:36.460\n Without all that sulfate being raised up,\n\n2:43:36.460 --> 2:43:38.140\n this Cambrian explosion almost certainly\n\n2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:39.820\n would not have happened.\n\n2:43:39.820 --> 2:43:42.300\n And then we wouldn't have had animals and so on and so on.\n\n2:43:42.300 --> 2:43:46.860\n So it's this kind of explanation of the Cambrian explosion.\n\n2:43:48.100 --> 2:43:51.900\n So let me actually say in several ways.\n\n2:43:51.900 --> 2:43:55.900\n So folks who challenge the validity\n\n2:43:55.900 --> 2:44:00.900\n of the theory of evolution will give us an example.\n\n2:44:00.940 --> 2:44:02.620\n Now I'm not well studied in this,\n\n2:44:02.620 --> 2:44:04.820\n but will give us an example of the Cambrian explosion\n\n2:44:04.820 --> 2:44:06.660\n as like, this thing is weird.\n\n2:44:07.460 --> 2:44:08.900\n Oh, it is weird, yeah.\n\n2:44:08.900 --> 2:44:13.740\n So the question I would have is\n\n2:44:13.740 --> 2:44:17.260\n what's the biggest mystery or gap in understanding\n\n2:44:17.260 --> 2:44:18.540\n about evolution?\n\n2:44:19.420 --> 2:44:21.140\n Is it the Cambrian explosion?\n\n2:44:21.140 --> 2:44:23.580\n And if so, what's our best understanding\n\n2:44:23.580 --> 2:44:27.020\n of how to explain, first of all, what is it?\n\n2:44:28.340 --> 2:44:30.940\n In my understanding, in the short amount of time,\n\n2:44:30.940 --> 2:44:32.660\n maybe 10 million years, 100 million years,\n\n2:44:32.660 --> 2:44:35.780\n something like that, a huge number of animals,\n\n2:44:35.780 --> 2:44:38.580\n a variety, diversity of animals were created.\n\n2:44:39.820 --> 2:44:41.980\n Anyway, there's like five questions in there.\n\n2:44:41.980 --> 2:44:43.220\n Is that the biggest mystery?\n\n2:44:43.220 --> 2:44:45.380\n No, I don't think it's a particularly big mystery\n\n2:44:45.380 --> 2:44:46.220\n really anymore.\n\n2:44:48.660 --> 2:44:51.220\n There are still mysteries about why then.\n\n2:44:51.220 --> 2:44:52.860\n And I've just said sulfate being washed\n\n2:44:52.860 --> 2:44:54.060\n into the oceans is one.\n\n2:44:54.060 --> 2:44:57.940\n It needs oxygen and oxygen levels rose around that time.\n\n2:44:59.180 --> 2:45:01.660\n So probably before that, they weren't high enough\n\n2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:02.940\n for animals.\n\n2:45:02.940 --> 2:45:04.660\n What we're seeing with the Cambrian explosion\n\n2:45:04.660 --> 2:45:07.860\n is the beginning of predators and prey relationships.\n\n2:45:07.860 --> 2:45:12.820\n We're seeing modern ecosystems and we're seeing arms races\n\n2:45:12.820 --> 2:45:17.820\n and we're seeing the full creativity of evolution unleashed.\n\n2:45:20.380 --> 2:45:22.540\n So I talked about the boring billion,\n\n2:45:22.540 --> 2:45:26.340\n nothing happens for one and a half billion years,\n\n2:45:26.340 --> 2:45:27.740\n one and a half billion years.\n\n2:45:29.500 --> 2:45:31.780\n The assumption, and this is completely wrong,\n\n2:45:31.780 --> 2:45:36.180\n this assumption, is then that evolution works really slowly\n\n2:45:36.180 --> 2:45:37.980\n and that you need billions of years\n\n2:45:37.980 --> 2:45:40.660\n to affect some small change\n\n2:45:40.660 --> 2:45:42.900\n and then another billion years to do something else.\n\n2:45:42.900 --> 2:45:44.660\n It's completely wrong.\n\n2:45:44.660 --> 2:45:47.180\n Evolution gets stuck in a stasis and it stays that way\n\n2:45:47.180 --> 2:45:50.140\n for tens of millions, hundreds of millions of years.\n\n2:45:50.140 --> 2:45:52.500\n And Steven Jay Gould used to argue this,\n\n2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:53.940\n he called it punctuated equilibrium,\n\n2:45:53.940 --> 2:45:55.500\n but he was doing it to do with animals\n\n2:45:55.500 --> 2:45:58.660\n and to do with the last 500 million years or so,\n\n2:45:58.660 --> 2:46:00.020\n where it's much less obvious\n\n2:46:00.020 --> 2:46:02.740\n than if you think about the entire planetary history.\n\n2:46:02.740 --> 2:46:04.780\n And then you realize that the first two billion years\n\n2:46:04.780 --> 2:46:06.540\n was bacteria only.\n\n2:46:06.540 --> 2:46:07.780\n You have the origin of life,\n\n2:46:07.780 --> 2:46:09.780\n two billion years of just bacteria,\n\n2:46:09.780 --> 2:46:11.900\n oxygen photosynthesis arising here.\n\n2:46:11.900 --> 2:46:14.300\n Then you have a global catastrophe,\n\n2:46:14.300 --> 2:46:16.420\n snowball earths and great oxidation event\n\n2:46:16.420 --> 2:46:18.220\n and then another billion years of nothing happening\n\n2:46:18.220 --> 2:46:20.420\n and then some period of upheavals\n\n2:46:20.420 --> 2:46:21.660\n and then another snowball earth\n\n2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:23.540\n and then suddenly you see the Cambrian explosion.\n\n2:46:23.540 --> 2:46:25.860\n This is long periods of stasis\n\n2:46:25.860 --> 2:46:27.700\n where the world is in a stable state\n\n2:46:27.700 --> 2:46:31.060\n and is not geared towards increasing complexity.\n\n2:46:31.060 --> 2:46:33.460\n It's just everything is in balance.\n\n2:46:33.460 --> 2:46:35.580\n And only when you have a catastrophic level,\n\n2:46:35.580 --> 2:46:38.660\n global level problem like a snowball earth,\n\n2:46:38.660 --> 2:46:40.300\n it forces everything out of balance\n\n2:46:40.300 --> 2:46:42.620\n and there's a tipping point and you end up somewhere else.\n\n2:46:42.620 --> 2:46:48.420\n Now, the idea that evolution is slow is wrong.\n\n2:46:48.420 --> 2:46:50.340\n It can be incredibly fast.\n\n2:46:50.340 --> 2:46:52.980\n And I mentioned earlier on that you can,\n\n2:46:52.980 --> 2:46:54.980\n in theory, it would take half a million years\n\n2:46:54.980 --> 2:46:57.940\n to invent an eye, for example, from a light sensitive spot.\n\n2:46:57.940 --> 2:47:00.580\n It doesn't take long to convert\n\n2:47:01.980 --> 2:47:05.540\n one kind of tube into a tube with nobbles on it\n\n2:47:05.540 --> 2:47:08.700\n into a tube with arms on it and then multiple arms\n\n2:47:08.700 --> 2:47:10.340\n and then at one end is the head\n\n2:47:10.340 --> 2:47:11.700\n where it starts out as a swelling.\n\n2:47:11.700 --> 2:47:15.220\n It's not difficult intellectually to understand\n\n2:47:15.220 --> 2:47:18.300\n how these things can happen.\n\n2:47:18.300 --> 2:47:20.980\n It boggles the mind that it can happen so quickly,\n\n2:47:20.980 --> 2:47:24.780\n but we're used to human timescales.\n\n2:47:24.780 --> 2:47:27.300\n And what we need to talk about is generations of things\n\n2:47:27.300 --> 2:47:30.500\n that live for a year in the ocean.\n\n2:47:30.500 --> 2:47:33.300\n And then a million years is a million generations.\n\n2:47:33.300 --> 2:47:35.940\n And the amount of change that you can do,\n\n2:47:35.940 --> 2:47:38.980\n it can affect in that period of time is enormous.\n\n2:47:38.980 --> 2:47:41.020\n And we're dealing with large populations of things\n\n2:47:41.020 --> 2:47:44.060\n where selection is sensitive to pretty small changes\n\n2:47:44.060 --> 2:47:47.540\n and can, so again, as soon as you throw in\n\n2:47:48.380 --> 2:47:50.860\n the competition of predators and prey\n\n2:47:50.860 --> 2:47:53.820\n and you're ramping up the scale of evolution,\n\n2:47:53.820 --> 2:47:56.180\n it's not very surprising that it happens very quickly\n\n2:47:56.180 --> 2:47:58.700\n when the environment allows it to happen.\n\n2:47:58.700 --> 2:47:59.940\n So I don't think there's a big mystery.\n\n2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:03.460\n There's lots of details that need to be filled in.\n\n2:48:03.460 --> 2:48:11.340\n I mean, the big mystery in biology is consciousness.\n\n2:48:11.340 --> 2:48:13.380\n The big mystery in biology is consciousness.\n\n2:48:13.380 --> 2:48:21.420\n Well, intelligence is kind of a mystery too.\n\n2:48:21.420 --> 2:48:28.100\n I mean, you said biology, not psychology.\n\n2:48:28.100 --> 2:48:30.580\n Because from a biology perspective,\n\n2:48:30.580 --> 2:48:32.380\n it seems like intelligence and consciousness\n\n2:48:32.380 --> 2:48:37.660\n all are the same, like weird, like all the brain stuff.\n\n2:48:37.660 --> 2:48:41.780\n I don't see intelligence as necessarily that difficult,\n\n2:48:41.780 --> 2:48:42.620\n I suppose.\n\n2:48:42.620 --> 2:48:44.740\n I mean, I see it as a form of computing\n\n2:48:44.740 --> 2:48:48.460\n and I don't know much about computing, so I...\n\n2:48:48.460 --> 2:48:50.220\n You don't know much about consciousness either.\n\n2:48:50.220 --> 2:48:54.340\n So I mean, I suppose, oh, I see.\n\n2:48:54.340 --> 2:48:57.500\n I see, I see, I see, I see.\n\n2:48:57.500 --> 2:49:00.300\n That consciousness you do know a lot about as a human being.\n\n2:49:00.300 --> 2:49:04.580\n No, no, I mean, I think I can understand the wiring\n\n2:49:04.580 --> 2:49:08.300\n of a brain as a series of, in pretty much the same way\n\n2:49:08.300 --> 2:49:16.700\n as a computer in theory, in terms of the circuitry of it.\n\n2:49:16.700 --> 2:49:21.780\n The mystery to me is how this system gives rise to feelings,\n\n2:49:21.780 --> 2:49:23.140\n as we were talking about earlier on.\n\n2:49:23.140 --> 2:49:27.820\n Yeah, I just, I think we oversimplify intelligence.\n\n2:49:27.820 --> 2:49:31.860\n I think the dance, the magic of reasoning\n\n2:49:31.860 --> 2:49:36.140\n is as interesting as the magic of feeling.\n\n2:49:36.140 --> 2:49:42.500\n We tend to think of reasoning as like very,\n\n2:49:42.500 --> 2:49:45.380\n running a very simplistic algorithm.\n\n2:49:45.380 --> 2:49:48.780\n I think reasoning is the interplay between memory,\n\n2:49:48.780 --> 2:49:51.900\n whatever the hell is going on, the unconscious mind,\n\n2:49:51.900 --> 2:49:55.100\n all of that.\n\n2:49:55.100 --> 2:49:58.460\n I'm not trying to diminish it in any way at all.\n\n2:49:58.460 --> 2:50:01.900\n Obviously, it's extraordinarily exquisitely complex,\n\n2:50:01.900 --> 2:50:06.860\n but I don't see a logical difficulty with how it works.\n\n2:50:06.860 --> 2:50:11.540\n Yeah, no, I mean, I agree with you, but sometimes, yeah,\n\n2:50:11.540 --> 2:50:16.340\n there's a big cloak of mystery around consciousness.\n\n2:50:16.340 --> 2:50:20.020\n Let me compare it with classical versus quantum physics.\n\n2:50:20.020 --> 2:50:26.580\n Classical physics is logical, and you can understand the kind\n\n2:50:26.580 --> 2:50:27.860\n of language we're dealing with.\n\n2:50:27.860 --> 2:50:29.540\n It's almost at the human level, we're\n\n2:50:29.540 --> 2:50:31.460\n dealing with stars and things that we can see.\n\n2:50:31.460 --> 2:50:34.500\n And when you get to quantum mechanics and things,\n\n2:50:34.500 --> 2:50:36.820\n it's practically impossible for the human mind\n\n2:50:36.820 --> 2:50:39.580\n to compute what just happened there.\n\n2:50:39.580 --> 2:50:41.940\n Yeah, I mean, that is the same.\n\n2:50:41.940 --> 2:50:44.940\n It's like, you understand mathematically\n\n2:50:44.940 --> 2:50:49.060\n that the notes of a musical composition, that's intelligence.\n\n2:50:49.060 --> 2:50:54.900\n But why it makes you feel a certain way,\n\n2:50:54.900 --> 2:50:57.620\n that is much harder to understand.\n\n2:50:57.620 --> 2:51:02.660\n Yeah, that's really, but it was interesting framing\n\n2:51:02.660 --> 2:51:05.580\n that that's a mystery at the core of biology.\n\n2:51:05.580 --> 2:51:09.740\n I wonder who solves consciousness.\n\n2:51:09.740 --> 2:51:11.340\n I tend to think consciousness will\n\n2:51:11.340 --> 2:51:15.780\n be solved by the engineer, meaning the person who builds\n\n2:51:15.780 --> 2:51:20.260\n it, who keeps trying to build the thing,\n\n2:51:20.260 --> 2:51:24.900\n versus biology, such a complicated system.\n\n2:51:24.900 --> 2:51:29.900\n I feel like the building blocks of consciousness\n\n2:51:29.900 --> 2:51:34.140\n from a biological perspective are like,\n\n2:51:34.140 --> 2:51:36.900\n that's like the final creation of a human being.\n\n2:51:36.900 --> 2:51:38.980\n So you have to understand the whole damn thing.\n\n2:51:38.980 --> 2:51:42.220\n You said the electrical field, but like,\n\n2:51:42.220 --> 2:51:43.820\n electrical field is plus plus.\n\n2:51:43.820 --> 2:51:47.220\n Everything, the whole shebang.\n\n2:51:47.220 --> 2:51:48.340\n I'm inclined to agree.\n\n2:51:48.340 --> 2:51:51.860\n I mean, my feeling is from my meager knowledge\n\n2:51:51.860 --> 2:51:53.900\n of the history of science is that the biggest breakthrough\n\n2:51:53.900 --> 2:51:57.780\n has usually come through from a field that was not related.\n\n2:51:57.780 --> 2:52:00.060\n So if anyone is not going to be a biologist who\n\n2:52:00.060 --> 2:52:03.020\n solves consciousness, just because biologists\n\n2:52:03.020 --> 2:52:06.740\n are too embedded in the nature of the problem.\n\n2:52:06.740 --> 2:52:09.020\n And then nobody's going to believe you when you've done it,\n\n2:52:09.020 --> 2:52:12.220\n because nobody's going to be able to prove that this AI is\n\n2:52:12.220 --> 2:52:16.140\n in fact conscious and sad in any case,\n\n2:52:16.140 --> 2:52:18.260\n and any more than you can prove that a dog is\n\n2:52:18.260 --> 2:52:20.140\n conscious and sad.\n\n2:52:20.140 --> 2:52:23.220\n So it tells you that it is in good language,\n\n2:52:23.220 --> 2:52:24.820\n and you must believe it.\n\n2:52:24.820 --> 2:52:27.460\n But I think most people will accept,\n\n2:52:27.460 --> 2:52:30.820\n if faced with that, that that's what it is.\n\n2:52:30.820 --> 2:52:38.980\n All of this probability of complex life,\n\n2:52:38.980 --> 2:52:45.620\n in one way, I think why it matters is that my expectation,\n\n2:52:45.620 --> 2:52:49.540\n I suppose, is that we will be over the next 100 years\n\n2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:53.340\n or so, if we survive at all, that AI will increasingly\n\n2:52:53.340 --> 2:52:53.980\n dominate.\n\n2:52:53.980 --> 2:52:56.020\n And pretty much anything that we put out\n\n2:52:56.020 --> 2:53:00.220\n into space looking for other, well, for the universe,\n\n2:53:00.220 --> 2:53:03.700\n for what's out there, will be AI, won't be us.\n\n2:53:03.700 --> 2:53:04.700\n We won't be doing that.\n\n2:53:04.700 --> 2:53:07.420\n Or when we do, it'll be on a much more limited scale.\n\n2:53:07.420 --> 2:53:12.500\n I suppose the same would apply to any alien civilization.\n\n2:53:12.500 --> 2:53:15.380\n So perhaps rather than looking for signs of life out there,\n\n2:53:15.380 --> 2:53:19.100\n we should be looking for AI out there.\n\n2:53:19.100 --> 2:53:25.060\n But then we face the problem that I\n\n2:53:25.060 --> 2:53:29.980\n don't see how a planet is going to give rise directly to AI.\n\n2:53:29.980 --> 2:53:34.140\n I can see how a planet can give rise directly to organic life.\n\n2:53:34.140 --> 2:53:36.900\n And if the principles that govern the evolution of life\n\n2:53:36.900 --> 2:53:40.020\n on Earth apply to other planets as well,\n\n2:53:40.020 --> 2:53:43.780\n and I think a lot of them would, then\n\n2:53:43.780 --> 2:53:47.660\n the likelihood of ending up with a humanlike civilization\n\n2:53:47.660 --> 2:53:50.500\n capable of giving rise to AI in the first place\n\n2:53:50.500 --> 2:53:52.100\n is massively limited.\n\n2:53:52.100 --> 2:53:54.100\n Once you've done it once, perhaps it takes over\n\n2:53:54.100 --> 2:53:57.300\n the universe, and maybe there's no issue.\n\n2:53:57.300 --> 2:54:01.060\n But it seems to me that the two are necessarily linked,\n\n2:54:01.060 --> 2:54:03.980\n that you're not going to just turn a sterile planet\n\n2:54:03.980 --> 2:54:07.740\n into an AI life form without the intermediary of the organics\n\n2:54:07.740 --> 2:54:08.380\n first.\n\n2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:13.180\n So you have to run the full evolutionary computation\n\n2:54:13.180 --> 2:54:15.420\n with the organics to create AI.\n\n2:54:15.420 --> 2:54:18.820\n How does AI bootstrap itself up without the aid, if you like,\n\n2:54:18.820 --> 2:54:20.540\n of an intelligent designer?\n\n2:54:20.540 --> 2:54:23.620\n The origin of AI is going to have\n\n2:54:23.620 --> 2:54:27.700\n to be in the chemistry of a planet.\n\n2:54:27.700 --> 2:54:29.980\n But that's not a limiting factor, right?\n\n2:54:29.980 --> 2:54:35.500\n So let me ask the Fermi paradox question.\n\n2:54:35.500 --> 2:54:40.420\n Let's say we live in this incredibly dark and beautiful\n\n2:54:40.420 --> 2:54:47.020\n world of just billions of planets with bacteria on it\n\n2:54:47.020 --> 2:54:49.220\n and very few intelligent civilizations,\n\n2:54:49.220 --> 2:54:52.620\n and yet there's a few out there.\n\n2:54:52.620 --> 2:54:58.060\n Why haven't we, at scale, seen them visit us?\n\n2:54:58.060 --> 2:54:59.860\n What's your sense?\n\n2:54:59.860 --> 2:55:02.460\n Is it because they don't exist?\n\n2:55:02.460 --> 2:55:04.700\n Well, don't exist in the right part of the universe\n\n2:55:04.700 --> 2:55:05.420\n at the right time.\n\n2:55:05.420 --> 2:55:08.260\n That's the simplest answer for it.\n\n2:55:08.260 --> 2:55:10.380\n Is that the one you find the most compelling,\n\n2:55:10.380 --> 2:55:13.860\n or is there some other explanation?\n\n2:55:13.860 --> 2:55:16.820\n I find that, no, it's not that I find it more compelling.\n\n2:55:16.820 --> 2:55:19.380\n It's that I find more probable.\n\n2:55:19.380 --> 2:55:21.580\n And I find all of them, I mean, there's\n\n2:55:21.580 --> 2:55:22.580\n a lot of handwaving in this.\n\n2:55:22.580 --> 2:55:24.300\n We just don't know.\n\n2:55:24.300 --> 2:55:27.900\n So I'm trying to read out from what I know about life on Earth\n\n2:55:27.900 --> 2:55:30.420\n to what might happen somewhere else.\n\n2:55:30.420 --> 2:55:33.540\n And it gives, to my mind, a bit of a pessimistic view\n\n2:55:33.540 --> 2:55:37.380\n of bacteria everywhere and only occasional intelligent life\n\n2:55:37.380 --> 2:55:41.580\n and running forward humans only once on Earth and nothing else\n\n2:55:41.580 --> 2:55:44.740\n that you would necessarily be any more excited about making\n\n2:55:44.740 --> 2:55:47.020\n contact with than you would be making contact with them\n\n2:55:47.020 --> 2:55:49.140\n on Earth.\n\n2:55:49.140 --> 2:55:52.460\n So I think the chances are pretty limited.\n\n2:55:52.460 --> 2:55:56.700\n And the chances of us surviving are pretty limited, too,\n\n2:55:56.700 --> 2:55:58.460\n in the way we're going on at the moment.\n\n2:55:58.460 --> 2:56:01.020\n The likelihood of us not making ourselves extinct\n\n2:56:01.020 --> 2:56:03.900\n within the next few hundred years,\n\n2:56:03.900 --> 2:56:08.140\n possibly within the next 50 or 100 years, seems quite small.\n\n2:56:08.140 --> 2:56:11.180\n I hope we can do better than that.\n\n2:56:11.180 --> 2:56:13.340\n So maybe the only thing that will survive from humanity\n\n2:56:13.340 --> 2:56:14.140\n will be AI.\n\n2:56:14.140 --> 2:56:15.900\n And maybe AI, once it exists and once\n\n2:56:15.900 --> 2:56:19.780\n it's capable of effectively copying itself and cutting\n\n2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:22.740\n humans out of the loop, then maybe that\n\n2:56:22.740 --> 2:56:24.500\n will take over the universe.\n\n2:56:24.500 --> 2:56:26.500\n I mean, there's a kind of inherent sadness\n\n2:56:26.500 --> 2:56:28.020\n to the way you described that.\n\n2:56:28.020 --> 2:56:31.820\n But isn't that also potentially beautiful,\n\n2:56:31.820 --> 2:56:37.940\n that that's the next step of life, I suppose,\n\n2:56:37.940 --> 2:56:39.940\n from your perspective, as long as it carries the flame\n\n2:56:39.940 --> 2:56:41.340\n of consciousness somehow?\n\n2:56:41.340 --> 2:56:43.180\n No, I think, yes, there can be some beauty to it\n\n2:56:43.180 --> 2:56:44.500\n being the next step of life.\n\n2:56:44.500 --> 2:56:46.500\n And I don't know if consciousness matters or not,\n\n2:56:46.500 --> 2:56:49.660\n from that point of view, to be honest with you.\n\n2:56:49.660 --> 2:56:50.380\n Yeah.\n\n2:56:50.380 --> 2:56:53.180\n But there's some sadness, yes, probably,\n\n2:56:53.180 --> 2:56:58.140\n because I think it comes down to the selfishness\n\n2:56:58.140 --> 2:56:59.740\n that we were talking about earlier on.\n\n2:56:59.740 --> 2:57:03.860\n I am an individual with a desire not\n\n2:57:03.860 --> 2:57:06.460\n to be displaced from life.\n\n2:57:06.460 --> 2:57:07.620\n I want to stay alive.\n\n2:57:07.620 --> 2:57:11.540\n I want to be here.\n\n2:57:11.540 --> 2:57:13.700\n So I suppose the threat that a lot of people would feel\n\n2:57:13.700 --> 2:57:15.300\n is that we will just be wiped out,\n\n2:57:15.300 --> 2:57:20.180\n so that there will be potential conflict between AI and humans\n\n2:57:20.180 --> 2:57:25.340\n and that AI will win because it's a lot smarter.\n\n2:57:25.340 --> 2:57:27.900\n Boy, would that be a sad state of affairs\n\n2:57:27.900 --> 2:57:32.500\n if consciousness is just an intermediate stage\n\n2:57:32.500 --> 2:57:36.740\n between bacteria and AI, right?\n\n2:57:36.740 --> 2:57:38.820\n Well, I would see bacteria as being potentially\n\n2:57:38.820 --> 2:57:41.020\n a kind of primitive form of consciousness anyway.\n\n2:57:41.020 --> 2:57:43.940\n So the whole of life on Earth, to my mind,\n\n2:57:43.940 --> 2:57:46.580\n is capable of some form of feelings\n\n2:57:46.580 --> 2:57:47.860\n in response to the environment.\n\n2:57:47.860 --> 2:57:49.320\n That's not to say it's intelligent,\n\n2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:52.580\n it's got its own algorithms for intelligence,\n\n2:57:52.580 --> 2:57:55.220\n but nothing comparable with us.\n\n2:57:55.220 --> 2:57:57.740\n I think it's beautiful what a planet, what a sterile planet,\n\n2:57:57.740 --> 2:57:59.180\n can come up with.\n\n2:57:59.180 --> 2:58:01.820\n It's astonishing that it's come up with all of this stuff\n\n2:58:01.820 --> 2:58:06.740\n that we see around us and that either we or whatever we\n\n2:58:06.740 --> 2:58:12.340\n produce is capable of destroying all of that is a sad thought.\n\n2:58:12.340 --> 2:58:17.540\n But it's also hugely pessimistic.\n\n2:58:17.540 --> 2:58:19.780\n I'd like to think that we're capable of giving rise\n\n2:58:19.780 --> 2:58:21.620\n to something which is at least as good,\n\n2:58:21.620 --> 2:58:24.140\n if not better than us, as AI.\n\n2:58:24.140 --> 2:58:29.860\n Yeah, I have that same optimism, especially a thing\n\n2:58:29.860 --> 2:58:31.860\n that is able to propagate throughout the universe\n\n2:58:31.860 --> 2:58:33.820\n more efficiently than humans can.\n\n2:58:33.820 --> 2:58:39.140\n Or extensions of humans, some merger with AI and humans,\n\n2:58:39.140 --> 2:58:43.900\n whether that comes from bioengineering of the human body\n\n2:58:43.900 --> 2:58:47.860\n to extend its life somehow, to carry\n\n2:58:47.860 --> 2:58:50.180\n that flame of consciousness and that personality\n\n2:58:50.180 --> 2:58:54.500\n and the beautiful tension that's within all of us,\n\n2:58:54.500 --> 2:58:56.620\n carry that through to multiple planets,\n\n2:58:56.620 --> 2:58:59.620\n to multiple solar systems, all out there in the universe.\n\n2:58:59.620 --> 2:59:02.100\n I mean, that's a beautiful vision.\n\n2:59:02.100 --> 2:59:07.700\n Whether AI can do that or bioengineered humans can,\n\n2:59:07.700 --> 2:59:09.100\n that's an exciting possibility.\n\n2:59:09.100 --> 2:59:13.300\n And especially meeting other alien civilizations\n\n2:59:13.300 --> 2:59:14.620\n in that same kind of way.\n\n2:59:14.620 --> 2:59:16.780\n Do you think aliens have consciousness?\n\n2:59:16.780 --> 2:59:18.300\n If they're organic.\n\n2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:20.500\n So organic is connected to consciousness.\n\n2:59:20.500 --> 2:59:24.340\n I mean, I think any system which is going to bootstrap itself\n\n2:59:24.340 --> 2:59:30.260\n up from planetary origins, I mean, let me finish this\n\n2:59:30.260 --> 2:59:31.620\n and then come on to something else.\n\n2:59:31.620 --> 2:59:34.260\n But from planetary origins is going\n\n2:59:34.260 --> 2:59:36.020\n to face similar constraints.\n\n2:59:36.020 --> 2:59:37.940\n And those constraints are going to be addressed\n\n2:59:37.940 --> 2:59:40.260\n in similar basic engineering ways.\n\n2:59:40.260 --> 2:59:41.740\n And I think it will be cellular.\n\n2:59:41.740 --> 2:59:43.860\n And I think it will have electrical charges.\n\n2:59:43.860 --> 2:59:46.340\n And I think it will have to be selected\n\n2:59:46.340 --> 2:59:47.620\n in populations over time.\n\n2:59:47.620 --> 2:59:48.820\n And all of these things will tend\n\n2:59:48.820 --> 2:59:50.340\n to give rise to the same processes\n\n2:59:50.340 --> 2:59:53.260\n as the simplest fix to a difficult problem.\n\n2:59:53.260 --> 2:59:54.940\n So I would expect it to be conscious, yes.\n\n2:59:54.940 --> 2:59:57.660\n And I would expect it to resemble life\n\n2:59:57.660 --> 3:00:00.580\n on Earth in many ways.\n\n3:00:00.580 --> 3:00:03.140\n When I was about, I guess, 15 or 16,\n\n3:00:03.140 --> 3:00:06.580\n I remember reading a book by Fred Hoyle\n\n3:00:06.580 --> 3:00:10.980\n called The Black Cloud, which I was a budding biologist\n\n3:00:10.980 --> 3:00:11.460\n at the time.\n\n3:00:11.460 --> 3:00:13.940\n And this was the first time I'd come across someone really\n\n3:00:13.940 --> 3:00:16.660\n challenging the heart of biology and saying,\n\n3:00:16.660 --> 3:00:18.740\n you are far too parochial.\n\n3:00:18.740 --> 3:00:20.940\n You're thinking about life as carbon based.\n\n3:00:20.940 --> 3:00:26.500\n Here's a life form which is kind of dust, interstellar dust\n\n3:00:26.500 --> 3:00:27.740\n on a solar system scale.\n\n3:00:30.260 --> 3:00:32.500\n And it's a novel.\n\n3:00:32.500 --> 3:00:34.380\n But I felt enormously challenged by that novel\n\n3:00:34.380 --> 3:00:39.980\n because it hadn't occurred to me how limited my thinking was,\n\n3:00:39.980 --> 3:00:43.380\n how narrow minded I was being.\n\n3:00:43.380 --> 3:00:46.140\n And here was a great physicist with a completely different\n\n3:00:46.140 --> 3:00:48.140\n conception of what life could be.\n\n3:00:48.140 --> 3:00:51.540\n And since then, I've seen him attacked in various ways.\n\n3:00:51.540 --> 3:00:55.780\n And I'm kind of reluctant to say the attacks make more sense\n\n3:00:55.780 --> 3:00:58.820\n to me than the original story, which\n\n3:00:58.820 --> 3:01:02.940\n is to say, even in terms of information processing,\n\n3:01:02.940 --> 3:01:04.280\n if you're on that scale and there's\n\n3:01:04.280 --> 3:01:06.580\n a limit to the speed of light, how quickly can something\n\n3:01:06.580 --> 3:01:10.900\n think if you're needing to broadcast\n\n3:01:10.900 --> 3:01:16.860\n across the solar system, it's going to be slow.\n\n3:01:16.860 --> 3:01:19.060\n It's not going to hold a conversation with you\n\n3:01:19.060 --> 3:01:22.500\n on the kind of timelines that Fred Hoyle was imagining,\n\n3:01:22.500 --> 3:01:25.420\n at least not by any easy way of doing it,\n\n3:01:25.420 --> 3:01:28.940\n assuming that the speed of light is a limit.\n\n3:01:28.940 --> 3:01:32.580\n And then again, you really can't.\n\n3:01:32.580 --> 3:01:34.940\n This is something Richard Dawkins argued long ago.\n\n3:01:34.940 --> 3:01:36.300\n And I do think he's right.\n\n3:01:36.300 --> 3:01:39.020\n There is no other way to generate\n\n3:01:39.020 --> 3:01:41.300\n this level of complexity than natural selection.\n\n3:01:41.300 --> 3:01:42.620\n Nothing else can do it.\n\n3:01:42.620 --> 3:01:44.780\n You need populations.\n\n3:01:44.780 --> 3:01:46.380\n And you need selection in populations\n\n3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:53.140\n and a kind of an isolated interstellar cloud.\n\n3:01:53.140 --> 3:01:55.300\n Again, there's unlimited time.\n\n3:01:55.300 --> 3:01:57.180\n And maybe there's no problems with distance.\n\n3:01:57.180 --> 3:02:03.780\n But you need to have a certain frequency of generational time\n\n3:02:03.780 --> 3:02:07.620\n to generate a serious level of complexity.\n\n3:02:07.620 --> 3:02:11.900\n And I just have a feeling it's never going to work.\n\n3:02:11.900 --> 3:02:15.540\n Well, as far as we know, so natural selection and evolution\n\n3:02:15.540 --> 3:02:17.460\n is really a powerful tool here on Earth.\n\n3:02:17.460 --> 3:02:19.020\n But there could be other mechanisms.\n\n3:02:19.020 --> 3:02:24.540\n So I don't know if you're familiar with cellular automata,\n\n3:02:24.540 --> 3:02:29.140\n but complex systems that have really simple components\n\n3:02:29.140 --> 3:02:31.500\n and seemingly move based on simple rules\n\n3:02:31.500 --> 3:02:34.660\n when they're taken as a whole, really interesting complexity\n\n3:02:34.660 --> 3:02:36.180\n emerges.\n\n3:02:36.180 --> 3:02:38.980\n I don't know what the pressures on that are.\n\n3:02:38.980 --> 3:02:41.460\n It's not really selection, but interesting complexity\n\n3:02:41.460 --> 3:02:42.740\n seems to emerge.\n\n3:02:42.740 --> 3:02:46.340\n And that's not well understood exactly why that complexity\n\n3:02:46.340 --> 3:02:46.860\n emerges.\n\n3:02:46.860 --> 3:02:48.980\n I think there's a difference between complexity\n\n3:02:48.980 --> 3:02:51.060\n and evolution.\n\n3:02:51.060 --> 3:02:53.300\n So some of the work we're doing on the origin of life\n\n3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:59.180\n is thinking about how do genes arise?\n\n3:02:59.180 --> 3:03:01.740\n How does information arise in biology?\n\n3:03:01.740 --> 3:03:03.860\n And thinking about it from the point of view\n\n3:03:03.860 --> 3:03:06.300\n of reacting CO2 with hydrogen, what do you get?\n\n3:03:06.300 --> 3:03:08.980\n Well, what you're going to get is carboxylic acids, then\n\n3:03:08.980 --> 3:03:09.700\n amino acids.\n\n3:03:09.700 --> 3:03:13.020\n It's quite hard to make nucleotides.\n\n3:03:13.020 --> 3:03:15.820\n And it's possible to make them, and it's been done,\n\n3:03:15.820 --> 3:03:18.300\n and it's been done following this pathway as well.\n\n3:03:18.300 --> 3:03:20.140\n But you make trace amounts.\n\n3:03:20.140 --> 3:03:21.780\n And so the next question, assuming\n\n3:03:21.780 --> 3:03:24.220\n that this is the right way of seeing the question, which\n\n3:03:24.220 --> 3:03:26.580\n maybe it's just not, but let's assume it is,\n\n3:03:26.580 --> 3:03:29.460\n is, well, how do you reliably make more nucleotides?\n\n3:03:29.460 --> 3:03:32.860\n And how do you become more complex and better at becoming\n\n3:03:32.860 --> 3:03:35.140\n a nucleotide generating machine?\n\n3:03:35.140 --> 3:03:38.420\n And the answer is, well, you need positive feedback loops,\n\n3:03:38.420 --> 3:03:40.260\n some form of autocatalysis.\n\n3:03:40.260 --> 3:03:43.060\n So that can work, and we know it happens in biology.\n\n3:03:43.060 --> 3:03:48.260\n If this nucleotide, for example, catalyzes CO2 fixation,\n\n3:03:48.260 --> 3:03:50.220\n then you're going to increase the rate of flux\n\n3:03:50.220 --> 3:03:51.620\n through the whole system, and you're\n\n3:03:51.620 --> 3:03:53.540\n going to effectively steepen the driving force\n\n3:03:53.540 --> 3:03:56.660\n to make more nucleotides.\n\n3:03:56.660 --> 3:03:59.940\n And this can be inherited because there\n\n3:03:59.940 --> 3:04:02.780\n are forms of membrane heredity that you can have.\n\n3:04:02.780 --> 3:04:06.500\n And effectively, if a cell divides in two\n\n3:04:06.500 --> 3:04:08.340\n and it's got a lot of stuff inside it,\n\n3:04:08.340 --> 3:04:10.180\n and that stuff is basically bound\n\n3:04:10.180 --> 3:04:14.300\n as a network which is capable of regenerating itself,\n\n3:04:14.300 --> 3:04:17.340\n then it will inevitably regenerate itself.\n\n3:04:17.340 --> 3:04:21.180\n And so you can develop greater complexity.\n\n3:04:21.180 --> 3:04:24.620\n But everything that I've said depends on the underlying rules\n\n3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:25.660\n of thermodynamics.\n\n3:04:25.660 --> 3:04:27.860\n There is no evolvability about that.\n\n3:04:27.860 --> 3:04:33.020\n It's simply an inevitable outcome of your starting point,\n\n3:04:33.020 --> 3:04:35.820\n assuming that you're able to increase the driving\n\n3:04:35.820 --> 3:04:37.220\n force through the system.\n\n3:04:37.220 --> 3:04:38.780\n You will generate more of the same.\n\n3:04:38.780 --> 3:04:40.180\n You'll expand on what you can do,\n\n3:04:40.180 --> 3:04:42.860\n but you'll never get anything different than that.\n\n3:04:42.860 --> 3:04:45.940\n And it's only when you introduce information into that\n\n3:04:45.940 --> 3:04:52.100\n as a gene, as a kind of small stretch of RNA, which\n\n3:04:52.100 --> 3:04:55.340\n can be random stretch, then you get real evolvability.\n\n3:04:55.340 --> 3:04:57.500\n Then you get biology as we know it.\n\n3:04:57.500 --> 3:05:00.500\n But you also have selection as we know it.\n\n3:05:00.500 --> 3:05:06.100\n Yeah, I mean, I don't know how to think about information.\n\n3:05:06.100 --> 3:05:08.100\n That's a kind of memory of the system.\n\n3:05:08.100 --> 3:05:10.620\n So it's not, yeah, at the local level,\n\n3:05:10.620 --> 3:05:13.420\n it's propagation of copying yourself and changing\n\n3:05:13.420 --> 3:05:17.660\n and improving your adaptability to the environment.\n\n3:05:17.660 --> 3:05:23.140\n But if you look at Earth as a whole, it has a kind of memory.\n\n3:05:23.140 --> 3:05:25.140\n That's the key feature of it.\n\n3:05:25.140 --> 3:05:27.620\n In what way?\n\n3:05:27.620 --> 3:05:30.620\n It remembers the stuff it tries.\n\n3:05:30.620 --> 3:05:33.900\n Like, if you were to describe Earth,\n\n3:05:33.900 --> 3:05:39.500\n I think evolution is something that we experience\n\n3:05:39.500 --> 3:05:41.700\n as individual organisms.\n\n3:05:41.700 --> 3:05:44.020\n That's how the individual organisms\n\n3:05:44.020 --> 3:05:45.260\n interact with each other.\n\n3:05:45.260 --> 3:05:47.740\n There's a natural selection.\n\n3:05:47.740 --> 3:05:54.020\n But when you look at Earth as an organism in its entirety,\n\n3:05:54.020 --> 3:05:55.740\n how would you describe it?\n\n3:05:55.740 --> 3:05:56.260\n I mean.\n\n3:05:56.260 --> 3:05:57.980\n Well, not as an organism.\n\n3:05:57.980 --> 3:06:00.860\n I mean, the idea of Gaia is lovely.\n\n3:06:00.860 --> 3:06:04.060\n And James Lovelock originally put Gaia out\n\n3:06:04.060 --> 3:06:07.580\n as an organism that had somehow evolved.\n\n3:06:07.580 --> 3:06:10.300\n And he was immediately attacked by lots of people.\n\n3:06:10.300 --> 3:06:14.220\n And he's not wrong, but he backpedaled somewhat\n\n3:06:14.220 --> 3:06:20.260\n because that was more of a poetic vision than the science.\n\n3:06:20.260 --> 3:06:23.180\n The science is now called Earth systems science.\n\n3:06:23.180 --> 3:06:26.740\n And it's really about how does the world regulate itself\n\n3:06:26.740 --> 3:06:29.300\n so it remains within the limits which are hospitable to life.\n\n3:06:29.300 --> 3:06:30.540\n And it does it amazingly well.\n\n3:06:30.540 --> 3:06:37.020\n And it is working at a planetary level of integration,\n\n3:06:37.020 --> 3:06:38.900\n of regulation.\n\n3:06:38.900 --> 3:06:41.260\n But it's not evolving by natural selection.\n\n3:06:41.260 --> 3:06:43.980\n And it can't because there's only one of it.\n\n3:06:43.980 --> 3:06:45.620\n And so it can change over time.\n\n3:06:45.620 --> 3:06:46.940\n But it's not evolving.\n\n3:06:46.940 --> 3:06:50.620\n All the evolution is happening in the parts of the system.\n\n3:06:50.620 --> 3:06:53.020\n Yeah, but it's a self sustaining organism.\n\n3:06:53.020 --> 3:06:56.140\n No, it's sustained by the sun.\n\n3:06:56.140 --> 3:07:00.940\n Right, so you don't think it's possible to see Earth\n\n3:07:00.940 --> 3:07:03.340\n as its own organism?\n\n3:07:03.340 --> 3:07:04.860\n I think it's poetic and beautiful.\n\n3:07:04.860 --> 3:07:08.540\n And I often refer to the Earth as a living planet.\n\n3:07:08.540 --> 3:07:14.860\n But it's not, in biological terms, an organism, no.\n\n3:07:14.860 --> 3:07:20.580\n If aliens were to visit Earth, what would they notice?\n\n3:07:20.580 --> 3:07:24.060\n What would be the basic unit of light they would notice?\n\n3:07:24.060 --> 3:07:25.020\n Trees, probably.\n\n3:07:25.020 --> 3:07:26.300\n I mean, it's green.\n\n3:07:26.300 --> 3:07:27.300\n It's green and blue.\n\n3:07:27.300 --> 3:07:29.140\n I think that's the first thing you'd notice.\n\n3:07:29.140 --> 3:07:32.060\n It stands out from space as being different to any\n\n3:07:32.060 --> 3:07:33.020\n of the other planets.\n\n3:07:33.020 --> 3:07:36.260\n So it would notice the trees at first because the green.\n\n3:07:36.260 --> 3:07:36.940\n Well, I would.\n\n3:07:36.940 --> 3:07:39.020\n I notice the green, yes.\n\n3:07:39.020 --> 3:07:42.820\n And then probably notice, figure out the photosynthesis.\n\n3:07:42.820 --> 3:07:47.460\n Probably notice cities a second, I suspect, maybe first.\n\n3:07:47.460 --> 3:07:49.300\n If they arrived at night, they'd notice cities first,\n\n3:07:49.300 --> 3:07:50.140\n that's for sure.\n\n3:07:50.140 --> 3:07:50.940\n It depends.\n\n3:07:50.940 --> 3:07:52.100\n Depends the time.\n\n3:07:52.100 --> 3:07:55.460\n You write quite beautifully in Transformers.\n\n3:07:55.460 --> 3:07:57.700\n Once again, I think you opened the book in this way.\n\n3:07:57.700 --> 3:07:59.060\n I don't remember.\n\n3:07:59.060 --> 3:08:04.020\n From space, describing Earth, it's such an interesting idea\n\n3:08:04.020 --> 3:08:10.540\n of what Earth is, you also, I mean, Hitchhiker's Guide,\n\n3:08:10.540 --> 3:08:13.300\n summarizing it as harmless, or mostly harmless.\n\n3:08:13.300 --> 3:08:15.580\n It's a beautifully poetic thing.\n\n3:08:15.580 --> 3:08:19.060\n You open Transformers with, from space,\n\n3:08:19.060 --> 3:08:22.260\n it looks gray and crystalline, obliterating\n\n3:08:22.260 --> 3:08:24.860\n the blue green colors of the living Earth.\n\n3:08:24.860 --> 3:08:27.220\n It is crisscrossed by irregular patterns\n\n3:08:27.220 --> 3:08:30.740\n and convergent striations.\n\n3:08:30.740 --> 3:08:33.220\n There's a central amorphous density\n\n3:08:33.220 --> 3:08:35.460\n where these scratches seem lighter.\n\n3:08:35.460 --> 3:08:38.340\n This, quote, growth does not look alive,\n\n3:08:38.340 --> 3:08:41.260\n although it has extended out along some lines,\n\n3:08:41.260 --> 3:08:44.980\n and there is something grasping and parasitic about it.\n\n3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:47.460\n Across the globe, there are thousands of them,\n\n3:08:47.460 --> 3:08:51.780\n varying in shape and detail, but all of them gray, angular,\n\n3:08:51.780 --> 3:08:54.660\n and organic, spreading.\n\n3:08:54.660 --> 3:08:59.340\n Yet at night, they light up, glowing up the dark sky,\n\n3:08:59.340 --> 3:09:00.820\n suddenly beautiful.\n\n3:09:00.820 --> 3:09:03.340\n Perhaps these cankers on the landscape\n\n3:09:03.340 --> 3:09:05.060\n are in some sense living.\n\n3:09:05.060 --> 3:09:07.260\n There's a controlled flow of energy.\n\n3:09:07.260 --> 3:09:10.460\n There must be information and some form of metabolism,\n\n3:09:10.460 --> 3:09:12.700\n some turnover of materials.\n\n3:09:12.700 --> 3:09:14.060\n Are they alive?\n\n3:09:14.060 --> 3:09:16.020\n No, of course not.\n\n3:09:16.020 --> 3:09:17.300\n They are cities.\n\n3:09:18.220 --> 3:09:22.100\n So is there some sense that cities are living beings?\n\n3:09:22.100 --> 3:09:24.980\n You think aliens would think of them as living beings?\n\n3:09:24.980 --> 3:09:27.580\n Well, it'd be easy to see it that way, wouldn't it?\n\n3:09:27.580 --> 3:09:30.580\n It wakes up at night, they wake up at night.\n\n3:09:30.580 --> 3:09:33.940\n Strictly nocturnal, yes.\n\n3:09:33.940 --> 3:09:36.180\n I imagine that any aliens that are smart enough\n\n3:09:36.180 --> 3:09:37.620\n to get here would understand\n\n3:09:37.620 --> 3:09:40.700\n that they're not living beings.\n\n3:09:40.700 --> 3:09:45.700\n My reason for saying that is that we tend to think\n\n3:09:47.460 --> 3:09:52.460\n of biology in terms of information and forget about cells.\n\n3:09:52.460 --> 3:09:54.820\n I was trying to draw a comparison between the cell\n\n3:09:54.820 --> 3:09:57.940\n as a city and the energy flow through the city\n\n3:09:57.940 --> 3:09:59.700\n and the energy flow through cells\n\n3:09:59.700 --> 3:10:01.580\n and the turnover of materials.\n\n3:10:01.580 --> 3:10:04.060\n And an interesting thing about cities\n\n3:10:04.060 --> 3:10:08.260\n is that they're not really exactly governed by anybody.\n\n3:10:09.860 --> 3:10:12.980\n There are regulations and systems and whatever else,\n\n3:10:12.980 --> 3:10:14.700\n but it's pretty loose.\n\n3:10:16.700 --> 3:10:18.420\n They have their own life,\n\n3:10:18.420 --> 3:10:20.420\n their own way of developing over time.\n\n3:10:20.420 --> 3:10:23.020\n And in that sense, they're quite biological.\n\n3:10:23.020 --> 3:10:27.020\n There was a plan after the great fire of London.\n\n3:10:27.020 --> 3:10:29.580\n Christopher Wren was making plans\n\n3:10:29.580 --> 3:10:31.780\n not only for St. Paul's Cathedral,\n\n3:10:31.780 --> 3:10:35.780\n but also to rebuild in large Parisian type boulevards,\n\n3:10:35.780 --> 3:10:40.780\n a large part of the area of central London that was burned.\n\n3:10:40.780 --> 3:10:42.500\n And it never happened\n\n3:10:42.500 --> 3:10:44.460\n because they didn't have enough money, I think.\n\n3:10:44.460 --> 3:10:45.940\n But it's interesting what was in the plan.\n\n3:10:45.940 --> 3:10:47.020\n There were all these boulevards\n\n3:10:47.020 --> 3:10:48.980\n that were built in the middle of the city.\n\n3:10:48.980 --> 3:10:50.540\n It's interesting what was in the plan.\n\n3:10:50.540 --> 3:10:51.900\n There were all these boulevards,\n\n3:10:51.900 --> 3:10:55.460\n but there were no pubs and no coffee houses\n\n3:10:55.460 --> 3:10:56.900\n or anything like that.\n\n3:10:56.900 --> 3:11:00.420\n And the reality was London just kind of grew up\n\n3:11:00.420 --> 3:11:03.220\n in a set of jumbled streets.\n\n3:11:03.220 --> 3:11:04.660\n And it was the coffee houses and the pubs\n\n3:11:04.660 --> 3:11:07.060\n where all the business of the city of London was being done.\n\n3:11:07.060 --> 3:11:09.180\n And that was where the real life of the city was.\n\n3:11:09.180 --> 3:11:10.060\n And no one had planned it.\n\n3:11:10.060 --> 3:11:13.780\n The whole thing was unplanned and works much better that way.\n\n3:11:13.780 --> 3:11:15.900\n And in that sense, the cell is completely unplanned,\n\n3:11:15.900 --> 3:11:17.980\n is not controlled by the genes in the nucleus\n\n3:11:17.980 --> 3:11:19.660\n in the way that we might like to think that it is,\n\n3:11:19.660 --> 3:11:22.300\n but it's kind of evolved entity\n\n3:11:22.300 --> 3:11:24.180\n that has the same kind of flux,\n\n3:11:24.180 --> 3:11:25.820\n the same animation, the same life.\n\n3:11:25.820 --> 3:11:28.540\n So I think it's a beautiful analogy,\n\n3:11:28.540 --> 3:11:32.420\n but I wouldn't get too stuck with it as a metaphor.\n\n3:11:32.420 --> 3:11:33.500\n See, I disagree with you.\n\n3:11:33.500 --> 3:11:34.980\n I disagree with you.\n\n3:11:34.980 --> 3:11:39.140\n I think you are so steeped,\n\n3:11:39.140 --> 3:11:42.580\n and actually the entirety of science,\n\n3:11:43.500 --> 3:11:45.540\n the history of science is steeped\n\n3:11:45.540 --> 3:11:50.140\n in a biological framework of thinking about what is life.\n\n3:11:50.140 --> 3:11:54.140\n And not just biological, it's very human centric too.\n\n3:11:54.140 --> 3:11:58.340\n That human, the human organism is the epitome of life\n\n3:11:59.940 --> 3:12:00.860\n on earth.\n\n3:12:00.860 --> 3:12:01.740\n I don't know.\n\n3:12:01.740 --> 3:12:04.060\n I think there is some deep fundamental way\n\n3:12:04.060 --> 3:12:07.180\n in which a city is a living being\n\n3:12:07.180 --> 3:12:09.100\n in the same way that a human individual can.\n\n3:12:09.100 --> 3:12:13.100\n But it doesn't give rise to an offspring city.\n\n3:12:13.100 --> 3:12:15.860\n So it doesn't work by natural selection.\n\n3:12:15.860 --> 3:12:17.860\n It works by, if anything, memes.\n\n3:12:17.860 --> 3:12:21.980\n It works by copying itself conceptually\n\n3:12:21.980 --> 3:12:24.580\n as a mode of being.\n\n3:12:24.580 --> 3:12:29.580\n So maybe memes, maybe ideas are the organisms\n\n3:12:29.700 --> 3:12:32.300\n that are really essential to life on earth.\n\n3:12:32.300 --> 3:12:34.140\n Maybe it's much more important\n\n3:12:34.140 --> 3:12:37.020\n about the collective aspect of human nature,\n\n3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:38.060\n the collective intelligence\n\n3:12:38.060 --> 3:12:40.060\n than the individual intelligence.\n\n3:12:40.060 --> 3:12:43.780\n Maybe the collective humanity is the organism.\n\n3:12:43.780 --> 3:12:48.140\n And the thing that defines the collective intelligence\n\n3:12:48.140 --> 3:12:50.740\n of humanity is the ideas.\n\n3:12:50.740 --> 3:12:54.300\n And maybe the way that manifests itself is cities,\n\n3:12:54.300 --> 3:12:57.900\n maybe, or societies or geographically concentrated societies\n\n3:12:57.900 --> 3:12:59.900\n or nations and all that kind of stuff.\n\n3:12:59.900 --> 3:13:02.100\n I mean, from an alien perspective,\n\n3:13:02.100 --> 3:13:06.460\n it's possible that that is the more deeply noticeable thing,\n\n3:13:06.460 --> 3:13:08.780\n not from a place of ignorance.\n\n3:13:08.780 --> 3:13:11.180\n What's noticeable doesn't tell you how it works.\n\n3:13:12.340 --> 3:13:14.140\n I think, I mean, I don't have any problem\n\n3:13:14.140 --> 3:13:15.140\n with what you're saying really,\n\n3:13:15.140 --> 3:13:20.140\n except that it's not possible without the humans.\n\n3:13:20.700 --> 3:13:25.300\n You know, we went from a hunter gatherers type economy,\n\n3:13:25.300 --> 3:13:28.260\n if you like, without cities to cities.\n\n3:13:28.260 --> 3:13:30.300\n And as soon as we get into human evolution\n\n3:13:30.300 --> 3:13:32.420\n and culture and society and so on,\n\n3:13:32.420 --> 3:13:36.460\n then yes, there are other forms of evolution,\n\n3:13:36.460 --> 3:13:38.660\n other forms of change.\n\n3:13:38.660 --> 3:13:41.700\n But cities don't directly propagate themselves,\n\n3:13:41.700 --> 3:13:43.940\n they propagate themselves through human societies\n\n3:13:43.940 --> 3:13:46.020\n and human societies only exist because humans\n\n3:13:46.020 --> 3:13:48.340\n as individuals propagate themselves.\n\n3:13:48.340 --> 3:13:51.420\n So there's a kind of, there is a hierarchy there\n\n3:13:51.420 --> 3:13:52.860\n and without the humans in the first place,\n\n3:13:52.860 --> 3:13:54.420\n none of the rest of it exists.\n\n3:13:54.420 --> 3:13:59.260\n So do you, life is primarily defined by the basic unit\n\n3:13:59.260 --> 3:14:01.660\n on which evolution can operate?\n\n3:14:01.660 --> 3:14:04.220\n I think it's a really important thing, yes.\n\n3:14:04.220 --> 3:14:05.060\n Yeah.\n\n3:14:05.060 --> 3:14:08.660\n And we don't know, we don't have any other better ideas\n\n3:14:08.660 --> 3:14:10.660\n than evolution for how to create life.\n\n3:14:10.660 --> 3:14:13.100\n I never came across a better idea than evolution.\n\n3:14:13.100 --> 3:14:15.740\n I mean, maybe I'm just ignorant and I don't know.\n\n3:14:15.740 --> 3:14:19.180\n And there's, you know, you mentioned that's no automator\n\n3:14:19.180 --> 3:14:22.540\n and so on, and I don't think specifically about that,\n\n3:14:22.540 --> 3:14:24.900\n but I have thought about it in terms of selective units\n\n3:14:24.900 --> 3:14:26.980\n of the origin of life and the difference\n\n3:14:26.980 --> 3:14:29.500\n between evolvability and complexity\n\n3:14:29.500 --> 3:14:31.420\n or just increasing complexity,\n\n3:14:31.420 --> 3:14:35.580\n but within very narrow, narrowly defined limits.\n\n3:14:35.580 --> 3:14:39.460\n The great thing about genes and about selection\n\n3:14:39.460 --> 3:14:41.420\n is it just knocks down all those limits.\n\n3:14:41.420 --> 3:14:43.540\n It gives you a world of information in the end\n\n3:14:43.540 --> 3:14:47.780\n which is limited only by the biophysical reality\n\n3:14:47.780 --> 3:14:49.940\n of what kind of an organism you are,\n\n3:14:49.940 --> 3:14:52.300\n what kind of a planet you live on and so on.\n\n3:14:52.300 --> 3:14:55.740\n And cities and all these other forms that look alive\n\n3:14:55.740 --> 3:14:58.060\n and could be described as alive\n\n3:14:58.060 --> 3:14:59.860\n because they can't propagate themselves\n\n3:14:59.860 --> 3:15:02.700\n can only exist as the product of something\n\n3:15:02.700 --> 3:15:04.180\n that did propagate itself.\n\n3:15:05.060 --> 3:15:05.900\n Yeah.\n\n3:15:07.180 --> 3:15:09.300\n I mean, there's a deeply compelling truth\n\n3:15:09.300 --> 3:15:11.700\n to that kind of way of looking at things,\n\n3:15:11.700 --> 3:15:16.100\n but I just hope that we don't miss the giant cloud\n\n3:15:17.820 --> 3:15:18.780\n among us.\n\n3:15:18.780 --> 3:15:21.380\n I kind of hope that I'm wrong about a lot of this\n\n3:15:21.380 --> 3:15:24.100\n because I can't say that my worldview\n\n3:15:24.100 --> 3:15:28.140\n is particularly uplifting, but in some sense,\n\n3:15:28.140 --> 3:15:29.900\n it doesn't matter if it's uplifting or not.\n\n3:15:29.900 --> 3:15:33.380\n Science is about what's reality, what's out there,\n\n3:15:33.380 --> 3:15:35.220\n why is it this way?\n\n3:15:35.220 --> 3:15:38.180\n And I think there's beauty in that too.\n\n3:15:39.100 --> 3:15:41.260\n There's beauty in darkness.\n\n3:15:41.260 --> 3:15:43.820\n You write about life and death\n\n3:15:43.820 --> 3:15:45.580\n sort of at the biological level.\n\n3:15:46.660 --> 3:15:49.780\n Does the question of suicide, why live,\n\n3:15:49.780 --> 3:15:52.220\n does the question of why the human mind\n\n3:15:52.220 --> 3:15:56.180\n is capable of depression, are you able to introspect\n\n3:15:56.180 --> 3:16:00.340\n that from a place of biology?\n\n3:16:00.340 --> 3:16:05.340\n Why our minds, why we humans can go to such dark places?\n\n3:16:05.700 --> 3:16:08.020\n Why can we commit suicide?\n\n3:16:08.020 --> 3:16:13.020\n Why can we go suffer, suffer period,\n\n3:16:15.660 --> 3:16:19.340\n but also suffer from a feeling of meaninglessness\n\n3:16:19.340 --> 3:16:23.100\n of going to a dark place that depression can take you?\n\n3:16:23.100 --> 3:16:26.180\n Is this a feature of life or is it a bug?\n\n3:16:30.420 --> 3:16:31.260\n I don't know.\n\n3:16:31.260 --> 3:16:32.460\n I mean, if it's a feature of life,\n\n3:16:32.460 --> 3:16:33.940\n then I suppose it would have to be true\n\n3:16:33.940 --> 3:16:35.540\n of other organisms as well.\n\n3:16:35.540 --> 3:16:39.220\n And I don't know, we were talking about dogs earlier on\n\n3:16:39.220 --> 3:16:43.540\n and they can certainly be very sad and upset\n\n3:16:43.540 --> 3:16:46.420\n and may mooch for days after their owner died\n\n3:16:46.420 --> 3:16:47.620\n or something like that.\n\n3:16:47.620 --> 3:16:50.260\n So I suspect in some sense it's a feature of biology.\n\n3:16:50.260 --> 3:16:54.380\n It's probably a feature of mortality.\n\n3:16:54.380 --> 3:16:59.380\n It's probably a, but beyond all of that,\n\n3:16:59.900 --> 3:17:01.740\n I mean, I guess there's two ways you could come at it.\n\n3:17:01.740 --> 3:17:03.340\n There's one of them would be to say,\n\n3:17:03.340 --> 3:17:07.540\n well, you can effectively do the math\n\n3:17:07.540 --> 3:17:10.260\n and come to the conclusion that it's all pointless\n\n3:17:10.260 --> 3:17:11.700\n and that there's really no point\n\n3:17:11.700 --> 3:17:13.100\n in me being here any longer.\n\n3:17:14.580 --> 3:17:17.700\n And maybe that's true in the greater scheme of things.\n\n3:17:17.700 --> 3:17:20.140\n You can justify yourself in terms of society,\n\n3:17:20.140 --> 3:17:22.100\n but society will be gone soon enough as well.\n\n3:17:22.100 --> 3:17:25.220\n And you end up with a very bleak place just by logic.\n\n3:17:26.060 --> 3:17:27.540\n In some sense, it's surprising\n\n3:17:27.540 --> 3:17:29.380\n that we can find any meaning at all.\n\n3:17:30.300 --> 3:17:32.140\n Well, maybe this is where consciousness comes in\n\n3:17:32.140 --> 3:17:35.140\n that we have transient joy, but with transient joy,\n\n3:17:35.140 --> 3:17:37.020\n we have transient misery as well.\n\n3:17:37.020 --> 3:17:40.220\n And sometimes with everything in biology,\n\n3:17:41.740 --> 3:17:45.260\n getting the regulation right is practically impossible.\n\n3:17:45.260 --> 3:17:47.300\n You will always have a bell shaped curve\n\n3:17:47.300 --> 3:17:50.340\n where some people unfortunately are at the joy end\n\n3:17:50.340 --> 3:17:52.100\n and some people are at the misery end.\n\n3:17:52.100 --> 3:17:55.060\n And that's the way brains are wired.\n\n3:17:55.060 --> 3:17:58.700\n And I doubt there's ever an escape from that.\n\n3:17:58.700 --> 3:18:00.740\n It's the same with sex and everything else as well.\n\n3:18:00.740 --> 3:18:04.220\n We're dealing with, you can't regulate it.\n\n3:18:04.220 --> 3:18:08.580\n So anything goes, it's all part of biology.\n\n3:18:12.220 --> 3:18:13.860\n Amen to that.\n\n3:18:13.860 --> 3:18:18.860\n Let me, on writing in your book, Power, Sex and Suicide.\n\n3:18:21.140 --> 3:18:24.060\n First of all, can I just read off the books you've written?\n\n3:18:24.060 --> 3:18:27.740\n If there's any better titles and topics to be covered,\n\n3:18:27.740 --> 3:18:28.900\n I don't know what they are.\n\n3:18:28.900 --> 3:18:29.740\n It makes me look forward\n\n3:18:29.740 --> 3:18:31.500\n to whatever you're going to write next.\n\n3:18:31.500 --> 3:18:34.140\n I hope there's things you write next.\n\n3:18:34.140 --> 3:18:37.140\n So first you wrote oxygen, the molecule that made the world\n\n3:18:37.140 --> 3:18:39.220\n as we've talked about this idea\n\n3:18:39.220 --> 3:18:41.620\n of the role of oxygen in life on earth.\n\n3:18:41.620 --> 3:18:46.380\n Then wait for it, power, sex, suicide, mitochondria\n\n3:18:46.380 --> 3:18:48.220\n and the meaning of life.\n\n3:18:48.220 --> 3:18:52.420\n Then life ascending, the 10 great inventions of evolution.\n\n3:18:52.420 --> 3:18:54.860\n The vital question, the first book I've read of yours,\n\n3:18:54.860 --> 3:18:58.040\n the vital question, why is life the way it is?\n\n3:18:58.040 --> 3:19:00.240\n And the new book, Transformer,\n\n3:19:00.240 --> 3:19:02.440\n the deep chemistry of life and death.\n\n3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:08.480\n In Power, Sex and Suicide, you write about writing\n\n3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:09.920\n or about a lot of things,\n\n3:19:09.920 --> 3:19:11.980\n but I have a question about writing.\n\n3:19:13.480 --> 3:19:16.640\n You write, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\n\n3:19:16.640 --> 3:19:20.720\n Ford Perfect spends 15 years researching his revision\n\n3:19:20.720 --> 3:19:23.180\n to the guide's entry on the earth,\n\n3:19:23.180 --> 3:19:25.880\n which originally read harmless.\n\n3:19:26.700 --> 3:19:29.080\n By the way, I would also as a side quest,\n\n3:19:29.080 --> 3:19:30.760\n as a side question would like to ask you\n\n3:19:30.760 --> 3:19:33.560\n what would be your summary of what earth is.\n\n3:19:34.720 --> 3:19:37.900\n You write, his long essay on the subject is edited down\n\n3:19:37.900 --> 3:19:41.560\n by the guide to read mostly harmless.\n\n3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:46.060\n I suspect that too many new editions suffer similar fate,\n\n3:19:46.060 --> 3:19:48.440\n if not through absurd editing decisions,\n\n3:19:48.440 --> 3:19:51.600\n at least through a lack of meaningful change in content.\n\n3:19:51.600 --> 3:19:54.360\n As it happens, nearly 15 years have passed\n\n3:19:54.360 --> 3:19:57.920\n since the first edition of Power, Sex, Suicide was published\n\n3:19:57.920 --> 3:20:02.400\n and I am resisting the temptation to make any lame revisions.\n\n3:20:02.400 --> 3:20:05.600\n Some say that even Darwin lessened the power\n\n3:20:05.600 --> 3:20:08.520\n of his arguments in The Origin of Species\n\n3:20:08.520 --> 3:20:10.320\n through his multiple revisions,\n\n3:20:10.320 --> 3:20:12.520\n in which he dealt with criticisms\n\n3:20:12.520 --> 3:20:16.040\n and sometimes shifted his views in the wrong direction.\n\n3:20:16.040 --> 3:20:19.320\n I prefer my original to speak for itself,\n\n3:20:19.320 --> 3:20:21.580\n even if it turns out to be wrong.\n\n3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:25.800\n Let me ask the question about writing,\n\n3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:28.160\n both your students in the academic setting,\n\n3:20:28.160 --> 3:20:30.920\n but also writing some of the most brilliant writings\n\n3:20:30.920 --> 3:20:33.400\n on science and humanity I've ever read.\n\n3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:36.280\n What's the process of writing?\n\n3:20:36.280 --> 3:20:41.280\n How do you advise other humans?\n\n3:20:43.140 --> 3:20:46.800\n If you were to talk to young Darwin or the young you\n\n3:20:47.760 --> 3:20:51.400\n and just young anybody and give advice about how to write\n\n3:20:51.400 --> 3:20:54.400\n and how to write well about these big topics,\n\n3:20:54.400 --> 3:20:55.300\n what would you say?\n\n3:20:56.720 --> 3:20:59.300\n I mean, I suppose there's a couple of points.\n\n3:20:59.300 --> 3:21:03.560\n One of them is what's the story?\n\n3:21:03.560 --> 3:21:04.760\n What do I want to know?\n\n3:21:04.760 --> 3:21:06.560\n What do I want to convey?\n\n3:21:06.560 --> 3:21:08.760\n Why does it matter to anybody?\n\n3:21:08.760 --> 3:21:13.480\n And very often the biggest, most interesting questions,\n\n3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:19.640\n the childlike questions are the one actually\n\n3:21:19.640 --> 3:21:22.000\n that everybody wants to ask, but dents quite,\n\n3:21:22.000 --> 3:21:23.600\n do it in case they look stupid.\n\n3:21:24.640 --> 3:21:26.960\n And one of the nice things about being in science\n\n3:21:26.960 --> 3:21:28.480\n is the longer you're in,\n\n3:21:28.480 --> 3:21:30.240\n the more you realize that everybody doesn't know\n\n3:21:30.240 --> 3:21:31.320\n the answer to these questions\n\n3:21:31.320 --> 3:21:33.520\n and it's not so stupid to ask them after all.\n\n3:21:36.200 --> 3:21:39.680\n So trying to ask the questions\n\n3:21:39.680 --> 3:21:44.520\n that I would have been asking myself at the age of 15, 16,\n\n3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:47.240\n when I was really hungry to know about the world\n\n3:21:47.240 --> 3:21:48.760\n and didn't know very much about it\n\n3:21:48.760 --> 3:21:53.760\n and wanted to go to the edge of what we know,\n\n3:21:53.760 --> 3:21:58.240\n but be helped to get there.\n\n3:21:58.240 --> 3:22:01.440\n I don't want to be too much terminology.\n\n3:22:01.440 --> 3:22:03.940\n And so I want someone to keep a clean eye\n\n3:22:03.940 --> 3:22:05.080\n on what the question is.\n\n3:22:07.000 --> 3:22:12.000\n Beyond that, I've wondered a lot about who am I writing for?\n\n3:22:13.200 --> 3:22:16.300\n And that was in the end, the only answer I had\n\n3:22:16.300 --> 3:22:19.160\n was myself at the age of 15 or 16,\n\n3:22:19.160 --> 3:22:24.160\n because even if you just don't know who's reading,\n\n3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:27.280\n but also where are they reading it?\n\n3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:29.680\n Are they reading it in the bath or in bed\n\n3:22:29.680 --> 3:22:34.240\n or on the Metro or listening to an audio book?\n\n3:22:34.240 --> 3:22:39.160\n Do you want to have a recapitulation every few pages\n\n3:22:39.160 --> 3:22:41.080\n because you read three pages at a time\n\n3:22:41.080 --> 3:22:44.120\n or are you really irritated by that?\n\n3:22:44.120 --> 3:22:46.880\n You're going to get criticism from people\n\n3:22:46.880 --> 3:22:48.800\n who are irritated by what you're doing.\n\n3:22:48.800 --> 3:22:50.600\n And you don't know who they are or what you're going to do\n\n3:22:50.600 --> 3:22:51.760\n that's going to irritate people.\n\n3:22:51.760 --> 3:22:53.800\n And in the end, all you can do is just try\n\n3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:56.400\n and please yourself.\n\n3:22:57.800 --> 3:23:00.520\n And that means, well, what are these big fun,\n\n3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:03.040\n fascinating and big questions?\n\n3:23:03.040 --> 3:23:04.960\n And what do we know about it?\n\n3:23:04.960 --> 3:23:07.160\n And can I convey that?\n\n3:23:07.160 --> 3:23:09.200\n And I kind of learned in trying to write,\n\n3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:14.360\n first of all, say what we know.\n\n3:23:14.360 --> 3:23:16.600\n And I was shocked in the first couple of books\n\n3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:19.600\n how often I came up quickly against\n\n3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:21.600\n all the stuff we don't know.\n\n3:23:21.600 --> 3:23:25.040\n And if you're trying to, I've realized later on\n\n3:23:25.040 --> 3:23:29.720\n in supervising various physicists and mathematicians\n\n3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:32.960\n who are PhD students, their maths is way beyond\n\n3:23:32.960 --> 3:23:34.480\n what I can do.\n\n3:23:34.480 --> 3:23:36.680\n But the process of trying to work out\n\n3:23:36.680 --> 3:23:37.960\n what are we actually going to model here?\n\n3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:39.240\n What's going into this equation?\n\n3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:40.480\n It's a very similar one to writing.\n\n3:23:40.480 --> 3:23:42.120\n What am I going to put on a page?\n\n3:23:42.120 --> 3:23:43.680\n What's the simplest possible way\n\n3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:45.640\n I can encapsulate this idea?\n\n3:23:45.640 --> 3:23:47.160\n So that I now have it as a unit\n\n3:23:47.160 --> 3:23:48.920\n that I can kind of see how it interacts\n\n3:23:48.920 --> 3:23:50.560\n with the other units.\n\n3:23:50.560 --> 3:23:53.040\n And you realize that, well, if this is like that\n\n3:23:53.040 --> 3:23:55.560\n and this is like this, then that can't be true.\n\n3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:00.560\n So you end up navigating your own path\n\n3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:02.040\n through this landscape.\n\n3:24:02.040 --> 3:24:02.960\n And that can be thrilling\n\n3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:05.160\n because you don't know where it's going.\n\n3:24:05.160 --> 3:24:07.480\n And I'd like to think that that's one of the reasons\n\n3:24:07.480 --> 3:24:09.120\n my books have worked for people\n\n3:24:09.120 --> 3:24:12.000\n because this sense of the thrilling adventure ride\n\n3:24:12.000 --> 3:24:14.200\n that I don't know where it's going either.\n\n3:24:14.200 --> 3:24:16.600\n So finding the simplest possible way\n\n3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:18.440\n to explain the things we know\n\n3:24:18.440 --> 3:24:20.080\n and the simplest possible way to explain\n\n3:24:20.080 --> 3:24:20.960\n the things we don't know\n\n3:24:20.960 --> 3:24:22.680\n and the tension between those two.\n\n3:24:22.680 --> 3:24:25.120\n And that's where the story emerges.\n\n3:24:25.120 --> 3:24:26.400\n What about the edit?\n\n3:24:27.240 --> 3:24:31.240\n Do you find yourself to the point of this,\n\n3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:35.320\n you know, editing down to mostly harmless?\n\n3:24:36.400 --> 3:24:40.720\n To arrive at simplicity, do you find the edit is productive\n\n3:24:40.720 --> 3:24:44.120\n or does it destroy the magic that was originally there?\n\n3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:47.920\n No, I usually find, I think I'm perhaps a better editor\n\n3:24:47.920 --> 3:24:48.880\n than I am a writer.\n\n3:24:48.880 --> 3:24:51.240\n I write and rewrite and rewrite and rewrite.\n\n3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:52.920\n Put a bunch of crap on the page first\n\n3:24:52.920 --> 3:24:55.280\n and then see the edit where it takes you.\n\n3:24:55.280 --> 3:24:58.200\n Yeah, but then there's the professional editors\n\n3:24:58.200 --> 3:24:59.200\n who come along as well.\n\n3:24:59.200 --> 3:25:04.200\n And I mean, in Transformer, the editor came back to me\n\n3:25:05.080 --> 3:25:07.120\n after I'd sent him, two months after I sent\n\n3:25:07.120 --> 3:25:08.600\n the first edition, he'd read the whole thing\n\n3:25:08.600 --> 3:25:11.560\n and he said, the first two chapters prevent\n\n3:25:11.560 --> 3:25:14.200\n a formidable hurdle to the general reader.\n\n3:25:14.200 --> 3:25:16.360\n Go and do something about it.\n\n3:25:16.360 --> 3:25:18.640\n And that was the last thing I really wanted to do.\n\n3:25:18.640 --> 3:25:21.440\n Your editor sounds very eloquent in speech.\n\n3:25:21.440 --> 3:25:23.000\n Yeah, well, this was an email,\n\n3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:26.600\n but I thought about it, you know,\n\n3:25:26.600 --> 3:25:28.800\n the bottom line is he was right.\n\n3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:33.240\n And so I put the whole thing aside for about two months,\n\n3:25:33.240 --> 3:25:35.080\n spent the summer, this would have been,\n\n3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:38.160\n I guess last summer, and then turned to it\n\n3:25:38.160 --> 3:25:40.880\n with full attention in about September or something\n\n3:25:40.880 --> 3:25:42.920\n and rewrote those chapters almost from scratch.\n\n3:25:42.920 --> 3:25:44.040\n I kept some of the material,\n\n3:25:44.040 --> 3:25:47.240\n but it took me a long time to process it,\n\n3:25:47.240 --> 3:25:49.800\n to work out what needs to change, where does it need to,\n\n3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:51.200\n I wasn't writing in this time.\n\n3:25:51.200 --> 3:25:53.360\n How am I going to tell this story better\n\n3:25:53.360 --> 3:25:54.840\n so it's more accessible and interesting?\n\n3:25:54.840 --> 3:25:56.880\n And in the end, I think it worked.\n\n3:25:56.880 --> 3:25:58.440\n It's still difficult.\n\n3:25:58.440 --> 3:26:00.760\n It's still biochemistry, but it has,\n\n3:26:00.760 --> 3:26:03.360\n he ended up saying, now he's got a barreling energy to it.\n\n3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:05.720\n And I was, you know, because he'd been,\n\n3:26:05.720 --> 3:26:07.120\n because he'd told me the truth the first time,\n\n3:26:07.120 --> 3:26:08.920\n I decided to believe that he was telling me the truth\n\n3:26:08.920 --> 3:26:11.740\n the second time as well and was delighted.\n\n3:26:13.480 --> 3:26:17.320\n Could you give advice to young people in general,\n\n3:26:18.680 --> 3:26:20.400\n folks in high school, folks in college,\n\n3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:23.080\n how to take on some of the big questions you've taken on?\n\n3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:24.760\n Now you've done that in the space of biology\n\n3:26:24.760 --> 3:26:26.680\n and expanded out.\n\n3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:31.680\n How can they have a career they can be proud of\n\n3:26:32.480 --> 3:26:35.160\n or have a life they can be proud of?\n\n3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:37.560\n Gosh, that's a big question.\n\n3:26:40.520 --> 3:26:42.680\n I'm sure you've gathered some wisdom\n\n3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:44.440\n that you can impart.\n\n3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:48.920\n Yeah, so the only advice that I actually ever give\n\n3:26:48.920 --> 3:26:53.840\n to my students is follow what you're interested in\n\n3:26:55.360 --> 3:26:58.080\n because they're often worried\n\n3:26:58.080 --> 3:26:59.840\n that if they make this decision now\n\n3:26:59.840 --> 3:27:01.920\n and do this course instead of that course,\n\n3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:04.080\n then they're going to restrict their career opportunities\n\n3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:08.720\n and there isn't a career path in science.\n\n3:27:08.720 --> 3:27:11.320\n It's not, I mean, there is, but there isn't.\n\n3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:14.080\n There's a lot of competition,\n\n3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:16.320\n there's a lot of death symbolically.\n\n3:27:17.480 --> 3:27:19.200\n So who survives?\n\n3:27:19.200 --> 3:27:20.960\n The people who survive are the people\n\n3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:25.320\n who care enough to still do it.\n\n3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:26.840\n And they're very often the people\n\n3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:31.280\n who don't worry too much about the future\n\n3:27:31.280 --> 3:27:33.520\n and are able to live in the present.\n\n3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:35.240\n Because if you do a PhD,\n\n3:27:35.240 --> 3:27:37.440\n you've competed hard to get onto the PhD,\n\n3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:39.520\n then you have to compete hard to get a postdoc job\n\n3:27:39.520 --> 3:27:44.080\n and you have the next one maybe on another continent\n\n3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:46.200\n and it's only two years anyway.\n\n3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:49.320\n And so, and there's no guarantee\n\n3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:52.320\n you're going to get a faculty position at the end of it.\n\n3:27:52.320 --> 3:27:53.160\n So.\n\n3:27:53.160 --> 3:27:54.960\n And there's always the next step to compete.\n\n3:27:54.960 --> 3:27:56.840\n If you get a faculty position,\n\n3:27:56.840 --> 3:27:59.840\n you get a tenure and with tenure go full professor\n\n3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:01.960\n and full professor, then you go to some kind of,\n\n3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:03.160\n whatever the discipline is,\n\n3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:04.320\n there's an award.\n\n3:28:04.320 --> 3:28:05.240\n If you're in physics,\n\n3:28:05.240 --> 3:28:06.840\n you're always competing for the Nobel Prize.\n\n3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:08.400\n There's different awards.\n\n3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:11.160\n And then eventually you're all competing to,\n\n3:28:11.160 --> 3:28:12.600\n I mean, there's always a competition.\n\n3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:13.960\n So there is no happiness.\n\n3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:14.920\n Happiness does not lie.\n\n3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:16.840\n If you're looking into the future, yes.\n\n3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:18.760\n And if what you're caring about is a career,\n\n3:28:18.760 --> 3:28:22.480\n then it's probably not the one for you.\n\n3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:25.560\n If though you can put that aside,\n\n3:28:25.560 --> 3:28:28.760\n and I've also worked in industry for a brief period\n\n3:28:28.760 --> 3:28:30.880\n and I was made redundant twice.\n\n3:28:30.880 --> 3:28:32.360\n So I know that.\n\n3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:35.960\n You know, there's no guarantee\n\n3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:37.920\n that you've got a career that way either.\n\n3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:38.760\n Yes.\n\n3:28:38.760 --> 3:28:42.640\n So, so live in the moment\n\n3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:44.200\n and try and enjoy what you're doing.\n\n3:28:44.200 --> 3:28:46.600\n And that means really go to the,\n\n3:28:48.520 --> 3:28:50.880\n go to the themes that you're most interested in\n\n3:28:50.880 --> 3:28:52.840\n and try and follow them as well as you can.\n\n3:28:52.840 --> 3:28:57.360\n And that tends to pay back in surprising ways.\n\n3:28:57.360 --> 3:28:58.640\n I don't know if you've found this as well,\n\n3:28:58.640 --> 3:29:03.640\n but I found that people will help you often.\n\n3:29:04.040 --> 3:29:08.400\n If they see some light shining in the eye,\n\n3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:10.520\n you're excited about their subject\n\n3:29:11.920 --> 3:29:15.800\n and you know, just want to talk about it.\n\n3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:18.600\n And they know that their friend in California\n\n3:29:18.600 --> 3:29:19.520\n has got a job coming up.\n\n3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:21.440\n They'll say, go for this, this guy's all right.\n\n3:29:21.440 --> 3:29:26.040\n You know, they'll use the network to help you out\n\n3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:27.040\n if you really care.\n\n3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:29.600\n And you're not gonna have a job two years down the line,\n\n3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:32.920\n but if what you really care about is what you're doing now,\n\n3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:34.120\n then it doesn't matter if you have a job\n\n3:29:34.120 --> 3:29:35.480\n in two years time or not.\n\n3:29:35.480 --> 3:29:38.840\n It'll work itself out if you've got the light in your eye.\n\n3:29:39.960 --> 3:29:42.360\n And so that's the only advice I can give.\n\n3:29:42.360 --> 3:29:46.920\n And most people probably drop out through that system\n\n3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:49.800\n because the fight is just not worth it for them.\n\n3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:51.840\n Yeah, when you have the light in your eye,\n\n3:29:51.840 --> 3:29:53.480\n when you have the excitement for the thing,\n\n3:29:53.480 --> 3:29:56.560\n what happens is you start to surround yourself with others\n\n3:29:56.560 --> 3:29:57.920\n that are interested in that same thing,\n\n3:29:57.920 --> 3:29:59.160\n that also have the light.\n\n3:29:59.160 --> 3:30:01.120\n If you really are rigorous about this\n\n3:30:01.120 --> 3:30:05.440\n because I think it does take, it doesn't,\n\n3:30:05.440 --> 3:30:07.360\n it takes effort to make.\n\n3:30:07.360 --> 3:30:08.840\n Oh, you've got to be obsessive.\n\n3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:11.280\n But if you're doing what you really love doing,\n\n3:30:11.280 --> 3:30:13.320\n then it's not work anymore, it's what you do.\n\n3:30:13.320 --> 3:30:15.600\n Yeah, but I also mean the surrounding yourself\n\n3:30:15.600 --> 3:30:17.840\n with other people that are obsessed about the same thing\n\n3:30:17.840 --> 3:30:19.080\n because depending on.\n\n3:30:19.080 --> 3:30:21.040\n Oh, that takes some work as well, yes.\n\n3:30:21.040 --> 3:30:21.880\n And luck.\n\n3:30:21.880 --> 3:30:23.880\n Finding the right, yeah, finding the right mentors,\n\n3:30:23.880 --> 3:30:27.600\n the collaborators, because I think one of the problem\n\n3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:32.600\n with the PhD process is people are not careful enough\n\n3:30:32.880 --> 3:30:34.840\n in picking their mentors.\n\n3:30:34.840 --> 3:30:38.360\n Those are people, mentors and colleagues and so on,\n\n3:30:38.360 --> 3:30:40.600\n those are people who are gonna define\n\n3:30:40.600 --> 3:30:43.880\n the direction of your life, how much you love a thing,\n\n3:30:43.880 --> 3:30:46.400\n how much, I mean the power of just like\n\n3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:51.160\n the few little conversations you have in the hallway,\n\n3:30:51.160 --> 3:30:52.360\n it's incredible.\n\n3:30:52.360 --> 3:30:55.680\n So you have to be a little bit careful in that.\n\n3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:58.080\n Sometimes you just get randomly almost assigned,\n\n3:30:59.120 --> 3:31:04.120\n really pursue, I suppose, the subject\n\n3:31:04.840 --> 3:31:07.480\n as much as you pursue the people that do that subject.\n\n3:31:07.480 --> 3:31:09.480\n So like both, the whole dance of it.\n\n3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:10.560\n They kind of go together really.\n\n3:31:10.560 --> 3:31:11.960\n Yeah, they really do.\n\n3:31:11.960 --> 3:31:14.720\n But take that part seriously.\n\n3:31:14.720 --> 3:31:17.520\n And probably in the way you're describing it,\n\n3:31:19.360 --> 3:31:21.800\n careful how you define success.\n\n3:31:21.800 --> 3:31:22.640\n Because.\n\n3:31:22.640 --> 3:31:24.800\n You'll never find happiness in success.\n\n3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:27.560\n There's a lovely quote from Robert Louis Stevenson,\n\n3:31:27.560 --> 3:31:29.320\n I think, who said, nothing in life\n\n3:31:29.320 --> 3:31:31.420\n is so disenchanting as attainment.\n\n3:31:33.160 --> 3:31:35.480\n Yeah, so I mean, in some sense,\n\n3:31:35.480 --> 3:31:40.480\n the true definition of success is getting to do today\n\n3:31:42.040 --> 3:31:43.600\n what you really enjoy doing.\n\n3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:46.360\n Just what fills you with joy.\n\n3:31:46.360 --> 3:31:48.120\n And that's ultimately success.\n\n3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:51.520\n So success isn't the thing beyond the horizon,\n\n3:31:51.520 --> 3:31:54.960\n the big trophy, the financials.\n\n3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:57.760\n I think it's as close as we can get to happiness.\n\n3:31:57.760 --> 3:31:59.800\n That's not to say you're full of joy all the time,\n\n3:31:59.800 --> 3:32:01.680\n but it's as close as we can get\n\n3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:03.620\n to a sustained human happiness\n\n3:32:03.620 --> 3:32:05.300\n is by getting some fulfillment\n\n3:32:05.300 --> 3:32:06.800\n from what you're doing on a daily basis.\n\n3:32:06.800 --> 3:32:11.240\n And if what you're looking for is the world\n\n3:32:11.240 --> 3:32:14.000\n giving you the stamp of approval with a Nobel Prize\n\n3:32:14.000 --> 3:32:15.820\n or a fellowship or whatever it is,\n\n3:32:15.820 --> 3:32:18.720\n then I've known people like this who,\n\n3:32:18.720 --> 3:32:23.720\n they're eaten away by the anger,\n\n3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:27.480\n the kind of caustic resentment\n\n3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:31.080\n that they've not been awarded this prize that they deserve.\n\n3:32:31.080 --> 3:32:32.960\n And the other way, if you put too much value\n\n3:32:32.960 --> 3:32:35.480\n into those kinds of prizes and you win them,\n\n3:32:35.480 --> 3:32:40.200\n I've gotten a chance to see that it also,\n\n3:32:42.460 --> 3:32:45.560\n the more quote unquote successful you are in that sense,\n\n3:32:45.560 --> 3:32:50.560\n the more you run the danger of growing ego\n\n3:32:50.640 --> 3:32:54.560\n so big that you don't get to actually enjoy\n\n3:32:54.560 --> 3:32:56.080\n the beauty of this life.\n\n3:32:56.080 --> 3:32:58.620\n You start to believe that you figured it all out\n\n3:32:58.620 --> 3:33:01.360\n as opposed to, I think what ultimately\n\n3:33:01.360 --> 3:33:03.280\n the most fun thing is is being curious\n\n3:33:03.280 --> 3:33:06.360\n about everything around you, being constantly surprised,\n\n3:33:06.360 --> 3:33:08.520\n and these little moments of discovery\n\n3:33:08.520 --> 3:33:12.120\n of enjoying beauty in small and big ways all around you.\n\n3:33:12.120 --> 3:33:14.240\n And I think the bigger your ego grows,\n\n3:33:14.240 --> 3:33:15.960\n the more you start to take yourself seriously,\n\n3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:17.880\n the less you're able to enjoy that.\n\n3:33:17.880 --> 3:33:19.720\n Amen to that, I couldn't agree more.\n\n3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:25.720\n So the summary from harmless to mostly harmless\n\n3:33:25.720 --> 3:33:27.640\n in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\n\n3:33:27.640 --> 3:33:31.440\n how would you try to summarize Earth?\n\n3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:34.440\n And if you were given,\n\n3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:36.480\n if you had to summarize the whole thing\n\n3:33:36.480 --> 3:33:38.560\n in a couple of sentences,\n\n3:33:38.560 --> 3:33:40.400\n and maybe throw in meaning of life in there,\n\n3:33:40.400 --> 3:33:45.400\n like what, why, why, why, maybe,\n\n3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:47.600\n is that a defining thing about humans\n\n3:33:47.600 --> 3:33:51.760\n that we care about the meaning of the whole thing?\n\n3:33:52.600 --> 3:33:55.800\n I wonder if that should be part of the,\n\n3:33:55.800 --> 3:33:58.720\n these creatures seem to be very lost.\n\n3:33:58.720 --> 3:34:00.400\n Yes, they're always asking why.\n\n3:34:00.400 --> 3:34:02.940\n I mean, that's my defining question is why.\n\n3:34:02.940 --> 3:34:06.700\n It was, as people used to make a joke,\n\n3:34:06.700 --> 3:34:08.600\n I have a small scar on my forehead\n\n3:34:08.600 --> 3:34:11.160\n from a climbing accident years ago.\n\n3:34:11.160 --> 3:34:13.760\n And the guy I was climbing with had dislodged a rock\n\n3:34:13.760 --> 3:34:15.520\n and he shouted something.\n\n3:34:15.520 --> 3:34:16.600\n He shouted below, I think,\n\n3:34:16.600 --> 3:34:18.440\n meaning that the rock was coming down.\n\n3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:20.280\n And I hadn't caught what he said,\n\n3:34:20.280 --> 3:34:23.600\n so I looked up and then smashed the street on my forehead.\n\n3:34:23.600 --> 3:34:27.920\n And everybody around me took the piss,\n\n3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:30.280\n saying he looked up to ask why.\n\n3:34:30.280 --> 3:34:33.000\n Yeah.\n\n3:34:33.000 --> 3:34:34.600\n But that's a human imperative.\n\n3:34:34.600 --> 3:34:37.220\n That's part of what it means to be human.\n\n3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:40.580\n Look up to the sky and ask why, and ask why.\n\n3:34:42.200 --> 3:34:44.600\n So your question, define the earth.\n\n3:34:49.200 --> 3:34:50.440\n I'm not sure I can do that.\n\n3:34:50.440 --> 3:34:52.940\n I mean, the first word that comes to mind is living.\n\n3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:57.880\n I wouldn't like to say mostly living, but perhaps.\n\n3:34:57.880 --> 3:34:58.720\n Mostly living.\n\n3:34:58.720 --> 3:35:00.200\n Well, it's interesting because like,\n\n3:35:00.200 --> 3:35:04.120\n if you were to write the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,\n\n3:35:04.120 --> 3:35:09.120\n I suppose, say our idea that we talked about,\n\n3:35:10.320 --> 3:35:13.640\n that bacteria is the most prominent form of life\n\n3:35:13.640 --> 3:35:16.420\n throughout the galaxy and the universe.\n\n3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:21.720\n I suppose that earth would be kind of unique\n\n3:35:21.720 --> 3:35:22.560\n and would require.\n\n3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:24.440\n There's abundance in that case.\n\n3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:25.280\n Yeah.\n\n3:35:25.280 --> 3:35:28.280\n It's profligate, it's rich, it's enormously,\n\n3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:29.920\n enormously living.\n\n3:35:29.920 --> 3:35:33.400\n So how would you describe that it's not bacteria?\n\n3:35:33.400 --> 3:35:34.240\n It's.\n\n3:35:36.560 --> 3:35:37.680\n Eukaryotic.\n\n3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:39.560\n Yeah.\n\n3:35:39.560 --> 3:35:41.700\n Well, I mean, that's the technical term,\n\n3:35:41.700 --> 3:35:43.000\n but it is basically it's.\n\n3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:47.240\n Yeah, and then.\n\n3:35:47.240 --> 3:35:49.280\n How would I describe that?\n\n3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:52.160\n I've actually really struggled with that term\n\n3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:55.400\n because the word, I mean, there's few words\n\n3:35:55.400 --> 3:35:58.600\n quite as good as eukaryotic to put everybody off immediately.\n\n3:35:58.600 --> 3:35:59.880\n You start using words like that\n\n3:35:59.880 --> 3:36:01.520\n and they'll leave the room.\n\n3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:03.680\n A Krebs cycle is another one that gets people\n\n3:36:03.680 --> 3:36:08.360\n to leave the room, but so I've tried to think,\n\n3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:10.840\n is there another word for eukaryotic that I can use?\n\n3:36:10.840 --> 3:36:13.200\n And really the only word that I've been able to use\n\n3:36:13.200 --> 3:36:18.200\n is complex, complex cells, complex life and so on.\n\n3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:22.860\n And that word, it serves one immediate purpose,\n\n3:36:22.860 --> 3:36:26.240\n which is to convey an impression.\n\n3:36:26.240 --> 3:36:31.240\n But then it means so many different things to everybody\n\n3:36:31.240 --> 3:36:33.640\n that actually is lost immediately.\n\n3:36:33.640 --> 3:36:35.160\n And so it's kind of.\n\n3:36:36.320 --> 3:36:38.480\n Well, that's a noticeable from the perspective\n\n3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:42.020\n of other planets, that is a noticeable phase transition\n\n3:36:42.020 --> 3:36:44.520\n of complexity is the eukaryotic.\n\n3:36:46.760 --> 3:36:49.240\n What about the harmless and the mostly harmless?\n\n3:36:49.240 --> 3:36:50.160\n Is that kind of.\n\n3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:55.480\n Probably accurate on a universal kind of scale.\n\n3:36:55.480 --> 3:36:59.240\n I don't think that humanity is in any danger\n\n3:36:59.240 --> 3:37:02.160\n of disturbing the universe at the moment.\n\n3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:06.240\n At the moment, which is why the mostly, we don't know.\n\n3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:10.000\n Depends what Elon is up to, depends how many rockets.\n\n3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:10.840\n I think.\n\n3:37:10.840 --> 3:37:13.840\n It'll be still even then a while, I think,\n\n3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:17.700\n before we disturb the fabric of time and space.\n\n3:37:17.700 --> 3:37:20.360\n Was the aforementioned Andrej Karpathy,\n\n3:37:20.360 --> 3:37:25.360\n I think he summarized Earth as a system\n\n3:37:25.360 --> 3:37:30.120\n where you hammer it with a bunch of photons.\n\n3:37:30.120 --> 3:37:33.520\n The input is like photons and the output is rockets.\n\n3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:37.080\n If you just.\n\n3:37:37.080 --> 3:37:38.440\n Well, that's a hell of a lot of photons\n\n3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:40.240\n before there was a rocket launch.\n\n3:37:40.240 --> 3:37:43.920\n But like, you know, maybe in the span of the universe,\n\n3:37:43.920 --> 3:37:46.080\n it's not that much time.\n\n3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:49.900\n And so, and I do wonder, you know, what the future is,\n\n3:37:49.900 --> 3:37:52.960\n whether we're just in the early beginnings of this Earth,\n\n3:37:52.960 --> 3:37:55.440\n which is important when you try to summarize it,\n\n3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:59.920\n or we're at the end, where humans have finally\n\n3:37:59.920 --> 3:38:02.680\n gained the ability to destroy the entirety\n\n3:38:02.680 --> 3:38:05.240\n of this beautiful project we've got going on.\n\n3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:09.160\n Not with nuclear weapons, with engineered viruses,\n\n3:38:09.160 --> 3:38:10.240\n with all those kinds of things.\n\n3:38:10.240 --> 3:38:12.460\n Or just inadvertently through global warming\n\n3:38:12.460 --> 3:38:14.020\n and pollution and so on.\n\n3:38:15.000 --> 3:38:15.920\n We're quite capable of that.\n\n3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:18.520\n I mean, we just need to pass the tipping point.\n\n3:38:18.520 --> 3:38:20.880\n I mean, I think we're more likely to do it inadvertently\n\n3:38:20.880 --> 3:38:24.520\n than through a nuclear war, which could happen at any time.\n\n3:38:24.520 --> 3:38:29.520\n But my fear is we just don't know\n\n3:38:30.280 --> 3:38:31.560\n where the tipping points are.\n\n3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:35.400\n And we will, we kind of think we're smart enough\n\n3:38:35.400 --> 3:38:37.480\n to fix the problem quickly if we really need to.\n\n3:38:37.480 --> 3:38:40.260\n I think that's the overriding assumption\n\n3:38:40.260 --> 3:38:43.000\n that we're all right for now.\n\n3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:45.740\n Maybe in 20 years time, it's gonna be a calamitous problem.\n\n3:38:45.740 --> 3:38:47.900\n And then we'll really need to put some serious mental power\n\n3:38:47.900 --> 3:38:51.400\n into fixing it without seriously worrying\n\n3:38:51.400 --> 3:38:53.720\n that perhaps that is too late.\n\n3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:58.660\n And that however brilliant we are, we miss the boat.\n\n3:38:59.600 --> 3:39:01.720\n And just walk off the cliff.\n\n3:39:01.720 --> 3:39:02.560\n I don't know.\n\n3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:05.960\n I have optimism in humans being clever descendants.\n\n3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:09.640\n Oh, I have no doubt that we can fix the problem.\n\n3:39:09.640 --> 3:39:10.760\n It's an urgent problem.\n\n3:39:11.780 --> 3:39:14.080\n We need to fix it pretty sharpish.\n\n3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:16.760\n And I do have doubts about whether politically\n\n3:39:16.760 --> 3:39:18.640\n we are capable of coming together enough\n\n3:39:18.640 --> 3:39:23.640\n to not just in any one country, but around the planet.\n\n3:39:23.840 --> 3:39:26.960\n To, I mean, I know we can do it, but do we have the will?\n\n3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:31.280\n Do we have the vision to accomplish it?\n\n3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:33.920\n That's what makes this whole ride fun.\n\n3:39:33.920 --> 3:39:35.040\n I don't know.\n\n3:39:35.040 --> 3:39:37.280\n Not only do we not know if we can handle\n\n3:39:37.280 --> 3:39:40.760\n the crises before us, we don't even know all the crises\n\n3:39:40.760 --> 3:39:43.960\n that are gonna be before us in the next 20 years.\n\n3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:48.360\n The ones I think that will most likely challenge us\n\n3:39:48.360 --> 3:39:51.280\n in the 21st century are the ones we don't even expect.\n\n3:39:51.280 --> 3:39:53.240\n People didn't expect World War II\n\n3:39:53.240 --> 3:39:54.620\n at the end of World War I.\n\n3:39:56.200 --> 3:39:58.720\n Some folks did, but yeah, not at the end of World War I.\n\n3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:01.600\n But by the late 1920s, I think people\n\n3:40:01.600 --> 3:40:03.040\n were beginning to worry about it.\n\n3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:05.960\n Yeah, no, there's always people worrying about everything.\n\n3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:08.000\n So if you focus on the thing that.\n\n3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:09.600\n People worry about, yes.\n\n3:40:09.600 --> 3:40:11.400\n Because there's a million things people worry about\n\n3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:14.840\n and 99.999999% of them don't come to be.\n\n3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:16.680\n Of course, the people that turn out to be right,\n\n3:40:16.680 --> 3:40:19.560\n they'll say, I knew all along, but that's not,\n\n3:40:19.560 --> 3:40:21.000\n that's not an accurate way of knowing\n\n3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:22.440\n what you could have predicted.\n\n3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:25.600\n I think rationally speaking, you can worry about it,\n\n3:40:25.600 --> 3:40:28.160\n but nobody thought you could have another World War.\n\n3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:31.320\n The war to end all wars, why would you have another war?\n\n3:40:31.320 --> 3:40:33.620\n And the idea of nuclear weapons,\n\n3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:37.400\n just technologically, is a very difficult thing\n\n3:40:37.400 --> 3:40:39.680\n to anticipate, to create a weapon\n\n3:40:39.680 --> 3:40:41.640\n that just jumps orders of magnitude\n\n3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:43.880\n and destructive capability.\n\n3:40:43.880 --> 3:40:46.240\n And of course, we can intuit all the things\n\n3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:49.260\n like engineered viruses, nanobots,\n\n3:40:49.260 --> 3:40:54.260\n artificial intelligence, yes, all the different\n\n3:40:54.320 --> 3:40:57.320\n complicated global effects of global warming.\n\n3:40:57.320 --> 3:40:59.460\n So how that changes the allocation of resources,\n\n3:40:59.460 --> 3:41:02.720\n the flow of energy, the tension between countries,\n\n3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:04.480\n the military conflict between countries,\n\n3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:06.760\n the reallocation of power,\n\n3:41:06.760 --> 3:41:09.340\n then looking at the role of China in this whole thing\n\n3:41:09.340 --> 3:41:13.600\n with Russia and growing influence of Africa\n\n3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:16.200\n and the weird dynamics of Europe,\n\n3:41:16.200 --> 3:41:19.440\n and then America falling apart through the political\n\n3:41:19.440 --> 3:41:22.720\n division fueled by recommender systems\n\n3:41:22.720 --> 3:41:24.140\n through Twitter and Facebook.\n\n3:41:24.140 --> 3:41:26.920\n The whole beautiful mess is just fun.\n\n3:41:26.920 --> 3:41:30.240\n And I think there's a lot of incredible engineers,\n\n3:41:30.240 --> 3:41:32.920\n incredible scientists, incredible human beings\n\n3:41:32.920 --> 3:41:36.140\n that while everyone is bickering and so on online\n\n3:41:36.140 --> 3:41:37.780\n for the fun of it on the weekends,\n\n3:41:37.780 --> 3:41:39.320\n they're actually trying to build solutions.\n\n3:41:39.320 --> 3:41:41.340\n And those are the people that will create\n\n3:41:41.340 --> 3:41:42.180\n something beautiful.\n\n3:41:42.180 --> 3:41:45.660\n At least I have, that's the process of evolution.\n\n3:41:45.660 --> 3:41:50.660\n It all started with a Chuck Norris single cell organism\n\n3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:56.520\n that went out from the vents and was the parent\n\n3:41:56.520 --> 3:41:57.880\n to all of us.\n\n3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:01.800\n And for that guy or lady or both, I guess,\n\n3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:05.820\n is a big thank you and I can't wait to what happens next.\n\n3:42:05.820 --> 3:42:08.440\n And I'm glad there's incredible humans writing\n\n3:42:08.440 --> 3:42:10.000\n and studying it like you are, Nick.\n\n3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.240\n It's a huge honor that you would talk to me.\n\n3:42:12.240 --> 3:42:13.280\n This is fantastic.\n\n3:42:13.280 --> 3:42:14.360\n This is really amazing.\n\n3:42:14.360 --> 3:42:17.860\n I can't wait to read what you write next.\n\n3:42:17.860 --> 3:42:19.260\n Thank you for existing.\n\n3:42:21.520 --> 3:42:24.600\n And thank you for talking today.\n\n3:42:24.600 --> 3:42:26.280\n Thank you.\n\n3:42:26.280 --> 3:42:28.800\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Nick Lane.\n\n3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:31.280\n To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\n\n3:42:31.280 --> 3:42:32.680\n in the description.\n\n3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:37.600\n And now let me leave you with some words from Steve Jobs.\n\n3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:40.720\n I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century\n\n3:42:40.720 --> 3:42:45.720\n will be at the intersection of biology and technology.\n\n3:42:45.820 --> 3:42:47.860\n A new era is beginning.\n\n3:42:47.860 --> 3:43:02.860\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
