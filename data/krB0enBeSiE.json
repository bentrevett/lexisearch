00:09.200\n cofounder of Mozilla, which created the Firefox browser,\n\n00:09.200 --> 00:12.860\n and now cofounder and CEO of Brave Software,\n\n00:12.860 --> 00:15.440\n which has created the Brave browser.\n\n00:15.440 --> 00:18.340\n Each of these are revolutionary technologies.\n\n00:18.340 --> 00:21.120\n JavaScript is one of the most widely used\n\n00:21.120 --> 00:24.920\n and impactful programming languages in the world.\n\n00:24.920 --> 00:29.040\n Firefox pioneered many browser ideas that we love today\n\n00:29.040 --> 00:31.280\n or even take for granted today,\n\n00:31.280 --> 00:33.540\n and Brave is looking to revolutionize\n\n00:33.540 --> 00:36.640\n not only the browser, but content creation online\n\n00:36.640 --> 00:38.280\n and the nature of the internet\n\n00:38.280 --> 00:40.680\n to make it fundamentally about respecting\n\n00:40.680 --> 00:43.440\n people's control over their data.\n\n00:43.440 --> 00:45.400\n Quick mention of our

01:00.840\n As a side note, let me say that there's a tension\n\n01:00.840 --> 01:03.160\n between theory and engineering\n\n01:03.160 --> 01:05.220\n that I've been thinking a lot about.\n\n01:05.220 --> 01:06.960\n I tweeted something like,\n\n01:06.960 --> 01:09.840\n \"'Good execution is more important than a good idea,\n\n01:09.840 --> 01:11.800\n \"'but one helps the other.'\"\n\n01:11.800 --> 01:13.480\n I think the wording of that sucks,\n\n01:13.480 --> 01:16.880\n but what I mean is a good idea is a must,\n\n01:16.880 --> 01:20.740\n but in my experience, good ideas are in abundance.\n\n01:20.740 --> 01:23.720\n Good execution, on the other hand, is rare.\n\n01:23.720 --> 01:26.040\n I think some mix of good timing, good idea,\n\n01:26.040 --> 01:28.160\n and good execution is essential.\n\n01:28.160 --> 01:29.840\n Getting that mix right is tough,\n\n01:29.840 --> 01:32.880\n and Brendan, somehow, multiple times in his career,\n\n01:32.880 --> 01:34.260\n did just that.\n\n01:34.260 --> 01:36.640\n I'm starting to believe it's more art than science,\n\n01:36.640 --> 01:39.200\n like most interesting things in life.\n\n01:39.200 --> 01:41.720\n If you enjoy

--> 01:48.840\n at Lex Friedman.\n\n01:48.840 --> 01:52.420\n And now, here's my conversation with Brendan Eich.\n\n01:53.360 --> 01:56.000\n When did you first fall in love with programming?\n\n01:56.000 --> 01:58.320\n I didn't program a lot when I was in high school,\n\n01:58.320 --> 02:01.580\n but I had a friend who had a Commodore PET,\n\n02:01.580 --> 02:03.160\n and after we saw Star Wars, he said,\n\n02:03.160 --> 02:05.660\n \"'Hey, let's make a basic program\n\n02:05.660 --> 02:08.040\n \"'that does the Death Star Trench run.'\"\n\n02:08.040 --> 02:10.960\n And it was just simple 2D graphics,\n\n02:10.960 --> 02:11.840\n and I didn't know what I was doing,\n\n02:11.840 --> 02:14.320\n so I just helped him out on the math and stuff like that.\n\n02:14.320 --> 02:16.120\n I was a math and science kid.\n\n02:16.120 --> 02:20.120\n I was really into the HP calculators of the early mid-'70s.\n\n02:20.120 --> 02:21.600\n These were the RPN.\n\n02:21.600 --> 02:23.440\n They were really strongly built,\n\n02:23.440 --> 02:27.520\n and as Arik Goldfinger said of gold, divinely heavy.\n\n02:27.520 --> 02:29.880\n There's probably some gold in them, too, gold metalization.\n\n02:29.880 --> 02:31.300\n But they were awesome calculators,\n\n02:31.300 --> 02:33.160\n and they had all the scientific functions,\n\n02:33.160 --> 02:34.460\n so I was really into that.\n\n02:35.420 --> 02:37.380\n So I aimed toward physics.\n\n02:38.720 --> 02:40.640\n I was a little late for the, I think,\n\n02:40.640 --> 02:42.460\n the 20th century golden age,\n\n02:42.460 --> 02:43.760\n and I read a lot of science fiction,\n\n02:43.760 --> 02:45.880\n so I was like, yeah, it's on the hyperdrives\n\n02:45.880 --> 02:50.360\n and warp drives, and physics was not gonna get there quickly,\n\n02:50.360 --> 02:52.480\n and I started hacking on computers\n\n02:52.480 --> 02:55.040\n while I was studying physics as an undergraduate\n\n02:55.040 --> 02:56.560\n at Santa Clara University,\n\n02:56.560 --> 03:00.120\n and I dodged the Fortran bullet\n\n03:00.120 --> 03:02.040\n because I was in the science department\n\n03:02.040 --> 03:03.140\n instead of the engineering department,\n\n03:03.140 --> 03:05.720\n where they still did Fortran card decks.\n\n03:05.720 --> 03:07.520\n I think they had an auto collator.\n\n03:07.520 --> 03:09.320\n But we were using Pascal,\n\n03:09.320 --> 03:14.320\n and I got one of the first portable C Compilers ports\n\n03:15.200 --> 03:17.760\n to the DEC minicomputers we were using,\n\n03:17.760 --> 03:19.320\n and I fell in love with programming\n\n03:19.320 --> 03:24.320\n just based on procedural abstraction, Pascal,\n\n03:25.880 --> 03:28.880\n just what now would be considered old school,\n\n03:28.880 --> 03:31.600\n like structured programming from the 70s.\n\n03:31.600 --> 03:33.480\n Niklaus Wirth, the creator of Pascal,\n\n03:33.480 --> 03:36.160\n was a good writer and a good pedagogue, right?\n\n03:36.160 --> 03:38.220\n He always at ETH would do these courses\n\n03:38.220 --> 03:40.120\n where it's like build your own computer,\n\n03:40.120 --> 03:42.720\n build your own compiler, build your own operating system.\n\n03:42.720 --> 03:44.220\n It was scratch. Yeah, kind of.\n\n03:44.220 --> 03:47.120\n And I know some people who were grad students under him\n\n03:47.120 --> 03:50.480\n and said he would torture the students\n\n03:50.480 --> 03:52.260\n with things like this custom email system\n\n03:52.260 --> 03:56.820\n that had 25 word limit and things like that.\n\n03:56.820 --> 03:59.240\n I unfortunately dodged both the Pascal\n\n03:59.240 --> 04:00.740\n and the Fortran bullets.\n\n04:00.740 --> 04:04.760\n Could you maybe linger on the Pascal?\n\n04:04.760 --> 04:06.320\n What kind of programming language was it?\n\n04:06.320 --> 04:08.160\n What is it reminiscent of today?\n\n04:08.160 --> 04:11.440\n Because it sounds like it may have had an impact\n\n04:11.440 --> 04:12.600\n on your own trajectory.\n\n04:12.600 --> 04:14.460\n Yeah, it was in the ALGOL family,\n\n04:14.460 --> 04:19.460\n and ALGOL was the big successful language design\n\n04:20.960 --> 04:23.160\n and compiler project in the 60s.\n\n04:23.160 --> 04:24.960\n It had a successor called ALGOL 68,\n\n04:24.960 --> 04:27.440\n which was ambitious but not as successful.\n\n04:27.440 --> 04:31.000\n But Pascal was kind of wordy procedures\n\n04:31.000 --> 04:32.580\n and functions language.\n\n04:32.580 --> 04:33.920\n It distinguished between functions\n\n04:33.920 --> 04:36.160\n which return a value and procedures which don't,\n\n04:36.160 --> 04:37.880\n which just compute.\n\n04:37.880 --> 04:42.580\n And you could say that whole ALGOL family went into ADA.\n\n04:42.580 --> 04:44.560\n Pascal had a second life thanks to Borland\n\n04:44.560 --> 04:48.040\n with Turbo Pascal, which was hugely successful.\n\n04:48.920 --> 04:51.000\n I think in large part due to Anders Helberg,\n\n04:51.000 --> 04:53.820\n who then went to Microsoft and did C Sharp and done that\n\n04:53.820 --> 04:55.520\n with his team there and has done really well\n\n04:55.520 --> 04:58.000\n doing TypeScript, type JavaScript.\n\n04:58.000 --> 05:00.800\n So yeah, there's a lineage here.\n\n05:00.800 --> 05:03.800\n But I was also interested in C and Unix\n\n05:03.800 --> 05:05.680\n by the time I was an undergrad\n\n05:05.680 --> 05:07.840\n because people were bringing Unix up\n\n05:07.840 --> 05:09.240\n on all sorts of hardware.\n\n05:09.240 --> 05:10.200\n I had some friends who were doing\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:14.480\n their own wirewrapped computers, 6820 maybe.\n\n05:14.480 --> 05:19.160\n And I was wirewrapping for my engineering course,\n\n05:19.160 --> 05:22.480\n 6809 or something simpler, building a computer on a board.\n\n05:22.480 --> 05:24.720\n And I wanted to build a more ambitious one\n\n05:24.720 --> 05:26.960\n and port Unix to it, but I picked the wrong processor.\n\n05:26.960 --> 05:30.960\n I picked the National Semiconductor NS16032,\n\n05:30.960 --> 05:33.440\n which was this amazing, you know,\n\n05:33.440 --> 05:37.200\n CISC, complex instruction set computer,\n\n05:37.200 --> 05:39.360\n and not the reduced instruction set computers\n\n05:39.360 --> 05:43.740\n that were just being contemplated into the mid eighties.\n\n05:43.740 --> 05:45.440\n And RISC ultimately went out.\n\n05:45.440 --> 05:48.360\n RISC won in some ways, it dissolved into,\n\n05:48.360 --> 05:50.800\n you have both now, you have these super scalar architectures\n\n05:50.800 --> 05:54.160\n where like Intel has kept probably too much\n\n05:54.160 --> 05:56.800\n backward compatibility at the instruction level,\n\n05:56.800 --> 05:58.920\n but that's just, there's a front end that parses that\n\n05:58.920 --> 06:01.240\n into these, you know, these wide internal instructions.\n\n06:01.240 --> 06:04.440\n So, you know, the very long instruction word research\n\n06:04.440 --> 06:06.900\n that was also interesting at the time\n\n06:06.900 --> 06:08.560\n kind of became the micro architecture\n\n06:08.560 --> 06:11.440\n inside the backward compatible Intel.\n\n06:11.440 --> 06:13.160\n But I picked a National Semi chip\n\n06:13.160 --> 06:14.840\n and it never got made successfully.\n\n06:14.840 --> 06:17.800\n It was full of bugs and I never could have brought it up.\n\n06:17.800 --> 06:21.160\n But I went on out of physics after three years\n\n06:21.160 --> 06:23.240\n into math, computer science.\n\n06:23.240 --> 06:25.740\n And like I said, I did it because I saw,\n\n06:25.740 --> 06:28.420\n I was being sort of childlike and naive about physics.\n\n06:28.420 --> 06:32.120\n And I thought, meanwhile, the Valley is go go for computers.\n\n06:32.120 --> 06:33.700\n The Apple II, right?\n\n06:33.700 --> 06:38.700\n The PC, the Intel 8086, 8088 based PC,\n\n06:40.720 --> 06:45.040\n the IBM, you know, gave Microsoft the future for,\n\n06:45.040 --> 06:46.800\n you know, somewhat fishy deal.\n\n06:46.800 --> 06:48.640\n So it was wide open in the computing space,\n\n06:48.640 --> 06:52.200\n but in physics, you were as optimistic about physics as?\n\n06:52.200 --> 06:54.680\n No, I mean, I was one of three brothers\n\n06:54.680 --> 06:56.060\n who were all in the same grade.\n\n06:56.060 --> 07:00.920\n I have a twin and a younger brother who skipped second grade\n\n07:00.920 --> 07:02.980\n and was with us the whole time after that.\n\n07:02.980 --> 07:04.480\n And, you know, he went on,\n\n07:04.480 --> 07:07.520\n he actually studied under Kip Thorne at Caltech.\n\n07:07.520 --> 07:09.560\n But he also didn't, he ended up in software.\n\n07:09.560 --> 07:12.340\n He didn't talk about physics stuff.\n\n07:12.340 --> 07:16.080\n Does it make you sad that theoretical physics,\n\n07:16.080 --> 07:17.120\n even with string theory,\n\n07:17.120 --> 07:20.920\n hasn't really had any foundational breakthroughs\n\n07:20.920 --> 07:23.320\n in the latter part of the 20th century?\n\n07:23.320 --> 07:25.220\n Yeah, in fact, I'd say the problem is theory\n\n07:25.220 --> 07:27.120\n over experiment.\n\n07:27.120 --> 07:29.920\n I would say, you know, we need more Aristotle\n\n07:29.920 --> 07:31.240\n and less Plato.\n\n07:31.240 --> 07:33.800\n You know, mathematics is not all physical.\n\n07:33.800 --> 07:36.280\n There are lots of mathematics that cannot be realized\n\n07:36.280 --> 07:38.360\n as far as I know in this world.\n\n07:38.360 --> 07:41.000\n So to understand the world, you need to do experiments.\n\n07:41.000 --> 07:45.200\n You need to not just dream up inductive theories\n\n07:45.200 --> 07:47.880\n that could have lots of alternative theories\n\n07:47.880 --> 07:50.120\n competing with them, with no way to decide between them,\n\n07:50.120 --> 07:53.000\n except aesthetics, which is not a good guide in my opinion.\n\n07:53.000 --> 07:54.760\n Yeah, I don't know if you are friends\n\n07:54.760 --> 07:56.880\n or have a relationship with Elon Musk.\n\n07:56.880 --> 08:00.520\n Where's the, in terms of like what you would love to see\n\n08:00.520 --> 08:02.800\n our society investing in, building up,\n\n08:02.800 --> 08:07.080\n is it closer to Elon or is it closer to Feynman\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:09.120\n and Einstein and those?\n\n08:09.120 --> 08:10.600\n Well, those gentlemen are no longer with us\n\n08:10.600 --> 08:12.000\n and I think that's noticed.\n\n08:12.000 --> 08:14.480\n So like I said, the real glory days of physics,\n\n08:14.480 --> 08:17.280\n the famous pictures from Germany before the second war\n\n08:17.280 --> 08:21.760\n were just a fantastic assembly of brains,\n\n08:21.760 --> 08:23.120\n Schrodinger and Einstein.\n\n08:23.120 --> 08:26.320\n And physics, I think, took a wrong turn\n\n08:26.320 --> 08:30.040\n that maybe all of, I would say, Western science\n\n08:30.040 --> 08:33.760\n took in going for models over reality, right?\n\n08:33.760 --> 08:35.320\n You see this in all sorts of fields.\n\n08:35.320 --> 08:38.000\n Now, we can build models that are very predictive\n\n08:38.000 --> 08:40.320\n and generative and then we build actual devices\n\n08:40.320 --> 08:42.200\n or semiconductors, things like that.\n\n08:42.200 --> 08:44.440\n That's good, I'm not dismissing that.\n\n08:44.440 --> 08:46.880\n We need good models, we need to experiment\n\n08:46.880 --> 08:49.680\n and prove them and test them.\n\n08:49.680 --> 08:51.920\n But the problem I've seen in physics,\n\n08:51.920 --> 08:55.640\n which you see certainly in economics, the dismal science,\n\n08:55.640 --> 08:59.080\n and you see surprisingly in other so called hard sciences\n\n08:59.080 --> 09:03.200\n is models that don't really have to be\n\n09:04.320 --> 09:05.440\n tested against reality.\n\n09:05.440 --> 09:07.640\n They can instead become policy tools\n\n09:07.640 --> 09:09.920\n or they can become, like I said,\n\n09:09.920 --> 09:12.960\n one of a large family of alternate theories\n\n09:12.960 --> 09:14.640\n that could be as predictive\n\n09:14.640 --> 09:17.000\n but nobody's doing the winnowing out.\n\n09:17.000 --> 09:18.920\n That's such an interesting tension in society.\n\n09:18.920 --> 09:21.000\n You see this in even the software scientists\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:24.440\n which have a deep love for psychology.\n\n09:24.440 --> 09:27.200\n You see this in epidemiology, not with the virus.\n\n09:27.200 --> 09:28.040\n Absolutely.\n\n09:28.040 --> 09:31.280\n There's this tension of how much of the world\n\n09:31.280 --> 09:35.040\n can we understand through just a beautifully fit model?\n\n09:35.040 --> 09:37.640\n And then at the same time, my main work\n\n09:37.640 --> 09:41.000\n is in machine learning where it's like\n\n09:41.000 --> 09:44.400\n there is no provable thing usually.\n\n09:44.400 --> 09:47.760\n It's all about just getting the right data set\n\n09:47.760 --> 09:49.640\n and getting tricks and so on.\n\n09:49.640 --> 09:51.760\n And there's this tension even in my own soul\n\n09:51.760 --> 09:55.680\n of I grew up on theoretical computer science.\n\n09:55.680 --> 09:58.920\n I loved approximation algorithms,\n\n09:58.920 --> 10:01.920\n all of that different complexity classes,\n\n10:01.920 --> 10:03.960\n just those little puzzles.\n\n10:03.960 --> 10:06.200\n I mean, I don't know, to you as somebody\n\n10:06.200 --> 10:08.600\n who was in math and computer science\n\n10:08.600 --> 10:11.280\n and then ended up going into places\n\n10:11.280 --> 10:13.880\n where you engineer some of the most impactful things\n\n10:13.880 --> 10:18.680\n in this world, do you see the P versus NP,\n\n10:18.680 --> 10:21.280\n all that whole space is interesting at all?\n\n10:21.280 --> 10:24.640\n Yeah, it's not that useful in practice.\n\n10:24.640 --> 10:27.920\n People are using it with sort of crypto analysis\n\n10:27.920 --> 10:31.760\n or asymptotic arguments about can we have\n\n10:31.760 --> 10:35.320\n a quantum resistant crypto algorithm, things like that,\n\n10:35.320 --> 10:36.560\n which may not be practical, right?\n\n10:36.560 --> 10:40.400\n If you follow Mikhail Diakonov or Gil Kalai,\n\n10:40.400 --> 10:43.640\n there are big questions about how quantum computing\n\n10:43.640 --> 10:46.800\n will scale up, how practical it will be.\n\n10:46.800 --> 10:49.880\n Is that something that you think about quantum computing?\n\n10:49.880 --> 10:51.080\n Not except for spare time.\n\n10:51.080 --> 10:53.560\n Like you said, I'm not using this kind of computer science\n\n10:53.560 --> 10:57.680\n in practice because almost everything now is engineering\n\n10:57.680 --> 11:02.160\n and finding ways to get computers\n\n11:02.160 --> 11:03.320\n to be more useful for people,\n\n11:03.320 --> 11:06.160\n which goes from design problems,\n\n11:06.160 --> 11:07.440\n which are really kind of an art.\n\n11:07.440 --> 11:09.960\n Like you said, anything you can't automate is an art.\n\n11:09.960 --> 11:13.360\n Well, we can have machine learning compose music\n\n11:13.360 --> 11:14.800\n and it can imitate, you can train it,\n\n11:14.800 --> 11:16.040\n and it can sound kind of decent,\n\n11:16.040 --> 11:18.680\n but maybe lacking that je ne sais quoi.\n\n11:18.680 --> 11:23.560\n But user interface still, I think, requires human art.\n\n11:23.560 --> 11:26.440\n So speaking of things that didn't follow\n\n11:26.440 --> 11:30.480\n a perfect theory and model, JavaScript,\n\n11:30.480 --> 11:31.320\n so there's two things.\n\n11:31.320 --> 11:34.360\n One, it had an impact on the world at a huge scale,\n\n11:34.360 --> 11:38.920\n obviously, and it also still is one of probably\n\n11:38.920 --> 11:41.400\n the most popular programming language in the world.\n\n11:41.400 --> 11:44.120\n So can we go back to the origin story?\n\n11:45.200 --> 11:47.840\n Can you tell the story of how JavaScript was created?\n\n11:47.840 --> 11:49.960\n Yeah, I was at Silicon Graphics\n\n11:49.960 --> 11:53.080\n after graduate school for seven years,\n\n11:53.080 --> 11:54.720\n and it got to be big and successful\n\n11:54.720 --> 11:56.800\n and divisionalized and political,\n\n11:56.800 --> 12:00.480\n and I thought kind of boring.\n\n12:00.480 --> 12:03.960\n And a friend who'd been there went to one of the last\n\n12:03.960 --> 12:06.040\n of the super companies, the super startups\n\n12:06.040 --> 12:07.640\n in the early 90s.\n\n12:07.640 --> 12:08.720\n There were several.\n\n12:08.720 --> 12:10.840\n I suppose General Magic was a little after that\n\n12:10.840 --> 12:11.920\n around the same time.\n\n12:11.920 --> 12:14.360\n But Micro Unity was that company that I went to,\n\n12:14.360 --> 12:16.880\n and it was because my friend Jeff Weinstein\n\n12:16.880 --> 12:18.040\n had gone there from Silicon Graphics.\n\n12:18.040 --> 12:21.960\n He recruited me, and Micro Unity was doing everything.\n\n12:21.960 --> 12:26.080\n So this was like the ultimate sort of pretend grad school.\n\n12:26.080 --> 12:29.360\n It was doing a new fab, new semiconductor process.\n\n12:29.360 --> 12:32.600\n It was doing new analog and digital circuits\n\n12:32.600 --> 12:36.080\n on the same very large but not wafer scale chip.\n\n12:36.080 --> 12:40.400\n Originally, it was five centimeters on a side.\n\n12:40.400 --> 12:43.880\n It was really hot too, so I needed a water cooler.\n\n12:43.880 --> 12:46.280\n It was a Craykiller, and then they shrunk it,\n\n12:46.280 --> 12:49.360\n and they tried to do a home sort of media processor\n\n12:49.360 --> 12:51.920\n that was essentially a barrel processor.\n\n12:51.920 --> 12:55.440\n But you could think of trying to do all the things\n\n12:55.440 --> 12:58.160\n that we now see in modern architectures\n\n12:58.160 --> 13:00.240\n with short vector instructions\n\n13:00.240 --> 13:05.120\n and sort of wide instructions or multiple issue,\n\n13:05.120 --> 13:07.520\n and doing a lot of the stuff in software\n\n13:07.520 --> 13:10.120\n because the second iteration, the set top box,\n\n13:10.120 --> 13:13.040\n was really for avoiding the cost to the cable company\n\n13:13.040 --> 13:14.520\n of rolling the trucks out\n\n13:14.520 --> 13:17.560\n to replace your garbage General Atlantic set top box\n\n13:17.560 --> 13:21.000\n with a totally newer, less garbagey one.\n\n13:21.000 --> 13:23.860\n So if you could have software gradable set top boxes,\n\n13:23.860 --> 13:26.200\n the cable companies thought they could save a lot of money\n\n13:26.200 --> 13:27.160\n and add features.\n\n13:27.160 --> 13:30.240\n Is this assembly, or which level of the software?\n\n13:30.240 --> 13:33.800\n It was like, we were writing in, we were using GCC.\n\n13:33.800 --> 13:36.240\n We were writing C++ and C.\n\n13:36.240 --> 13:39.880\n Somebody I worked with there, really very smart guy,\n\n13:39.880 --> 13:41.680\n hired from a sort of Wall Street\n\n13:41.680 --> 13:45.240\n hotshot programming consultancy,\n\n13:45.240 --> 13:47.040\n did his own hardware design as well as software.\n\n13:47.040 --> 13:49.380\n And we were working on how to make\n\n13:49.380 --> 13:50.740\n not only a short vector units,\n\n13:50.740 --> 13:53.080\n but general bit shufflers and permuters.\n\n13:53.080 --> 13:57.440\n So you could do things like crypto algorithms efficiently,\n\n13:57.440 --> 14:01.400\n and you could do demodulation of the cable,\n\n14:01.400 --> 14:05.240\n complex quadrature amplitude modulated signal.\n\n14:05.240 --> 14:07.980\n So you're basically taking A to D converters,\n\n14:07.980 --> 14:09.000\n dumping things in buffers,\n\n14:09.000 --> 14:10.740\n and then doing the rest in software.\n\n14:10.740 --> 14:13.480\n All the framing and the Reed Solomon and Viterbi\n\n14:13.480 --> 14:14.480\n and all that error correction.\n\n14:14.480 --> 14:16.060\n So that was really great learning experience,\n\n14:16.060 --> 14:16.920\n but it was not gonna work.\n\n14:16.920 --> 14:18.660\n It was doing too many risky things at once, right?\n\n14:18.660 --> 14:20.460\n If you, as Jim Clark said to me,\n\n14:20.460 --> 14:23.200\n when I hopped to Netscape after three years at MicroUnity,\n\n14:23.200 --> 14:26.040\n he said, oh yeah, you do 10 things each,\n\n14:26.040 --> 14:28.580\n one in 10 odds, it's gonna be one in 10 billion, right?\n\n14:29.840 --> 14:31.080\n The multiplication principle.\n\n14:31.080 --> 14:33.360\n So, Netscape was already a rocket,\n\n14:33.360 --> 14:36.760\n and I passed the chance to go there in 1994.\n\n14:36.760 --> 14:39.200\n I knew the founders because I worked at SGI,\n\n14:39.200 --> 14:40.040\n Clark's company.\n\n14:40.040 --> 14:42.200\n Could you pause for a second in Netscape?\n\n14:42.200 --> 14:44.800\n When was the launch of this rocket?\n\n14:44.800 --> 14:45.840\n 94.\n\n14:45.840 --> 14:47.320\n 94 was the launch of Netscape?\n\n14:47.320 --> 14:49.720\n And I went there in early 95 in April.\n\n14:49.720 --> 14:52.200\n Okay, so you said you missed the launch.\n\n14:52.200 --> 14:55.560\n Well, I missed the first floor employment opportunity,\n\n14:55.560 --> 14:58.960\n but the IPO was August 1995, so I was there for that.\n\n14:58.960 --> 15:02.280\n How obvious was it that Netscape was like world changing?\n\n15:02.280 --> 15:04.080\n What was the layout?\n\n15:04.080 --> 15:06.160\n Was Netscape one of the first big browsers?\n\n15:06.160 --> 15:09.280\n Yes, so when I was at MicroUnity still in 93,\n\n15:09.280 --> 15:11.720\n we saw a browser called Mosaic.\n\n15:11.720 --> 15:14.760\n And up till then, we'd used email and we'd used Usenet,\n\n15:14.760 --> 15:18.680\n the NNTP protocol, we'd use news readers, we used FTP,\n\n15:18.680 --> 15:20.860\n we used all these old internet protocols,\n\n15:20.860 --> 15:24.760\n all relying on the DNS and TCP IP and UDP for that matter.\n\n15:25.720 --> 15:26.800\n When I was at Silicon Graphics,\n\n15:26.800 --> 15:28.140\n we brought up the whole stack, right?\n\n15:28.140 --> 15:31.760\n We had to discover how to find the ethernet addresses\n\n15:31.760 --> 15:34.720\n on your network and then find IP addresses for them,\n\n15:34.720 --> 15:35.940\n ARP protocol, all that stuff.\n\n15:35.940 --> 15:38.680\n And it was great because nobody knew in the 80s\n\n15:38.680 --> 15:41.480\n what was gonna win, all the proprietary stacks\n\n15:41.480 --> 15:44.840\n like IBM, SNA and DeckNet and all these other protocols\n\n15:44.840 --> 15:46.320\n were saying, we're gonna do it\n\n15:46.320 --> 15:48.080\n or it's gonna be heterogeneous future.\n\n15:48.080 --> 15:52.520\n And instead it was Berkeley Unix and the TCP IP stack\n\n15:52.520 --> 15:54.900\n that dated back to the ARPANET that won.\n\n15:54.900 --> 15:57.680\n And I think we knew it, we all knew it at SGI,\n\n15:57.680 --> 15:59.280\n but the salespeople didn't.\n\n15:59.280 --> 16:02.080\n And so they kept trying to get multiple network stacks\n\n16:02.080 --> 16:04.360\n interoperating, but in the end it won.\n\n16:04.360 --> 16:08.120\n And so that was the internet and it was email and texty\n\n16:08.120 --> 16:09.520\n and it was used and very texty.\n\n16:09.520 --> 16:12.540\n And then Tim Berners Lee did his thing,\n\n16:12.540 --> 16:14.120\n but I don't think I was paying attention.\n\n16:14.120 --> 16:16.400\n And I think the date when he first did it\n\n16:16.400 --> 16:19.580\n or when he wrote the famous emails and pushed back to 89,\n\n16:19.580 --> 16:23.160\n but I noticed a mosaic in 93 because one of the things\n\n16:23.160 --> 16:26.560\n that Mark Andreessen and Eric Bina did at NCSA\n\n16:26.560 --> 16:31.320\n was they innovated on the early HTML standard.\n\n16:31.320 --> 16:33.040\n They in particular Mark sent this email saying,\n\n16:33.040 --> 16:34.360\n hey everybody, we think you should be able\n\n16:34.360 --> 16:36.240\n to put an image in a page.\n\n16:36.240 --> 16:38.400\n And you know when he sent that Eric Bina had already\n\n16:38.400 --> 16:39.240\n written the code.\n\n16:39.240 --> 16:41.920\n And I talked to Tim Berners Lee more recently\n\n16:41.920 --> 16:43.080\n just a few years ago and he was like,\n\n16:43.080 --> 16:45.880\n oh, we had another way of doing it and it didn't work out\n\n16:45.880 --> 16:48.000\n because Mark shipped his in mosaic.\n\n16:48.000 --> 16:50.040\n And this convinced me of several things.\n\n16:50.040 --> 16:53.840\n One, the internet meant there was a huge first mover\n\n16:53.840 --> 16:58.080\n advantage and being fast, getting on first mattered a lot.\n\n16:58.080 --> 17:01.840\n And so Richard Gabriel of scheme and poetry fame\n\n17:01.840 --> 17:03.160\n has written about this, the famous.\n\n17:03.160 --> 17:06.320\n What's poetry? Well, he's a poet.\n\n17:06.320 --> 17:07.160\n Oh, actual poetry.\n\n17:07.160 --> 17:08.360\n Is he talking about some kind of something?\n\n17:08.360 --> 17:09.200\n No, no.\n\n17:09.200 --> 17:10.200\n I mean, he's the founder of Lucid,\n\n17:10.200 --> 17:12.920\n which is where Jamie Zawinski worked before Netscape.\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:16.320\n And Lucid was doing compilers and Lucid Emacs,\n\n17:16.320 --> 17:18.240\n which was a fork of Emacs,\n\n17:18.240 --> 17:22.680\n famously Jamie fighting against Richard Stallman, Stalmax.\n\n17:22.680 --> 17:25.260\n And so Richard Gabriel, very, very brainy computer guy,\n\n17:25.260 --> 17:27.360\n but also a poet, but he wrote a nice essay\n\n17:27.360 --> 17:28.960\n that gets abused all the time.\n\n17:28.960 --> 17:30.760\n In fact, Jamie's put a kind of warning in front\n\n17:30.760 --> 17:32.640\n of his version of it on his site,\n\n17:32.640 --> 17:34.400\n JWC.org called Worse is Better.\n\n17:34.400 --> 17:38.240\n And this is about survival advantage of software\n\n17:38.240 --> 17:39.780\n in the network world, in my opinion.\n\n17:39.780 --> 17:41.440\n It's about Unix.\n\n17:41.440 --> 17:43.720\n It started out being framed as Unix and Lisp,\n\n17:43.720 --> 17:46.000\n good news, bad news, because all the Lisp people,\n\n17:46.000 --> 17:48.320\n the MIT people were like, oh, you know,\n\n17:48.320 --> 17:52.720\n the crown jewel scheme, this Faberge egg or Common Lisp,\n\n17:52.720 --> 17:54.520\n this giant cathedral, of course we're going to win.\n\n17:54.520 --> 17:55.740\n This is civilization.\n\n17:55.740 --> 17:58.040\n And those, you know, those farmers in New Jersey\n\n17:58.040 --> 18:01.320\n to borrow from the Sopranos, those picks down at Bell Labs,\n\n18:01.320 --> 18:03.400\n they're just, you know, there's nothing sound there.\n\n18:03.400 --> 18:04.240\n It's all hacking.\n\n18:05.280 --> 18:06.840\n Well, guess what won?\n\n18:06.840 --> 18:09.960\n Wow, so you're saying this is a fundamental,\n\n18:09.960 --> 18:14.800\n like principle of the internet is moving fast wins.\n\n18:14.800 --> 18:16.960\n You could say in almost any network system,\n\n18:16.960 --> 18:18.260\n like in biological evolution,\n\n18:18.260 --> 18:20.720\n you see successful alleles sweep populations\n\n18:20.720 --> 18:23.440\n and they don't always have, you know,\n\n18:23.440 --> 18:24.480\n they aren't free of flaws.\n\n18:24.480 --> 18:26.360\n They're heterozygous advantage, right?\n\n18:26.360 --> 18:30.200\n You can get both parents give you the gene variant\n\n18:30.200 --> 18:31.800\n and you get sickle cell anemia, right?\n\n18:31.800 --> 18:34.680\n But if one of them does, you're more resistant to malaria.\n\n18:34.680 --> 18:38.160\n And so this isn't a beautiful process,\n\n18:38.160 --> 18:39.520\n except at large scale.\n\n18:39.520 --> 18:41.520\n And then you realize that because it moves fast\n\n18:41.520 --> 18:44.200\n and can adapt, it can win.\n\n18:44.200 --> 18:46.600\n And people still struggle with this.\n\n18:46.600 --> 18:47.880\n I used to struggle with this\n\n18:47.880 --> 18:50.120\n because JavaScript was done in such a hurry\n\n18:50.120 --> 18:52.980\n and the force of web compatibility meant\n\n18:52.980 --> 18:55.240\n early mistakes couldn't be fixed.\n\n18:55.240 --> 18:57.680\n And even the standards process injected new mistakes,\n\n18:57.680 --> 18:59.040\n as it will.\n\n18:59.040 --> 19:00.400\n But often standards bodies go back\n\n19:00.400 --> 19:01.680\n and making compatible changes.\n\n19:01.680 --> 19:03.080\n You can't do that with the web.\n\n19:03.080 --> 19:05.200\n It's more like, again, like biology,\n\n19:05.200 --> 19:07.120\n you preserve what still works.\n\n19:07.120 --> 19:10.360\n You don't want to break ATP metabolism or whatever.\n\n19:10.360 --> 19:15.140\n So you have to kind of resign yourself to the reality\n\n19:15.140 --> 19:20.000\n of worse is better being enshrined\n\n19:20.000 --> 19:23.120\n in actual design points you might not like.\n\n19:23.120 --> 19:25.780\n And that happened with JavaScript and I'm way over it,\n\n19:25.780 --> 19:28.880\n but it also, I think was a huge advantage.\n\n19:28.880 --> 19:31.160\n That's why JavaScript has kind of swept\n\n19:31.160 --> 19:33.400\n a lot of programming domains.\n\n19:33.400 --> 19:34.840\n People will say, oh, it's not because of merit.\n\n19:34.840 --> 19:35.660\n Well, you're right.\n\n19:35.660 --> 19:37.600\n But we also improved it over time in the standards body.\n\n19:37.600 --> 19:39.320\n I spent 20 years doing that.\n\n19:39.320 --> 19:41.760\n And you don't get that choice.\n\n19:41.760 --> 19:45.360\n It's like, I'm not saying that that was the best language.\n\n19:45.360 --> 19:47.360\n I'm just saying that was the right time to do it.\n\n19:47.360 --> 19:50.280\n And I like to say the alternative was not to do it.\n\n19:50.280 --> 19:52.180\n I could have told Netscape, I can't do this.\n\n19:52.180 --> 19:53.200\n It's too rushed.\n\n19:53.200 --> 19:55.260\n And it would have been visual basic script.\n\n19:55.260 --> 19:57.180\n And it would have been bad.\n\n19:57.180 --> 19:59.780\n So that's a good way to present the alternative.\n\n19:59.780 --> 20:03.020\n But so it was a Netscape and you have written it\n\n20:03.020 --> 20:05.860\n in how many days and why was it only that many days?\n\n20:05.860 --> 20:08.880\n And what was the goal and the underlying principles\n\n20:08.880 --> 20:09.720\n in your mind at the time?\n\n20:09.720 --> 20:11.740\n So the whole, I'm sort of describing worse is better\n\n20:11.740 --> 20:14.980\n in a frenetic way because it fit the model of Netscape.\n\n20:14.980 --> 20:18.420\n When it was known that Jim Clark\n\n20:18.420 --> 20:20.020\n and Marc Inves were founding Netscape\n\n20:20.020 --> 20:22.880\n and they did the first release in 1994,\n\n20:22.880 --> 20:24.820\n that browser took over from Mosaic.\n\n20:24.820 --> 20:27.100\n In fact, that's why Mozilla is called that.\n\n20:27.100 --> 20:28.260\n It's the Mosaic killer.\n\n20:28.260 --> 20:30.140\n It's like the giant monster that kills Mosaic.\n\n20:30.140 --> 20:30.980\n That's awesome.\n\n20:30.980 --> 20:34.180\n And they knew they could, it wasn't that, again,\n\n20:34.180 --> 20:36.220\n it's not like you're doing advanced scientific research\n\n20:36.220 --> 20:37.380\n that is changing the world.\n\n20:37.380 --> 20:41.020\n You're more like taking down the last iteration\n\n20:41.020 --> 20:43.180\n on the browser, Marc did, which had images\n\n20:43.180 --> 20:45.900\n and other importances before he stopped working on it.\n\n20:45.900 --> 20:49.060\n And you're making Netscape the new thing that has images,\n\n20:49.060 --> 20:51.720\n plugins, which was the way to do video back in the day.\n\n20:51.720 --> 20:54.260\n It had something that's kind of died now for tiled windows\n\n20:54.260 --> 20:56.000\n called frames and frame sets.\n\n20:56.000 --> 20:59.280\n HTML tables, that was new.\n\n20:59.280 --> 21:01.640\n Eric Bina did tables in Netscape 1.1.\n\n21:01.640 --> 21:05.040\n So when I got there, they were heading toward IPO.\n\n21:05.040 --> 21:07.640\n Clark wanted the IPO early, I think his instinct was right.\n\n21:07.640 --> 21:10.280\n And that kicked off the whole dot com era, right?\n\n21:10.280 --> 21:13.280\n There was a recession in the US in 91.\n\n21:13.280 --> 21:15.140\n You can see old law and order reruns\n\n21:15.140 --> 21:16.520\n where they talk about the recession\n\n21:16.520 --> 21:18.080\n and how hard it's hitting New Yorkers.\n\n21:18.080 --> 21:20.440\n And after that, Greenspan really goosed things\n\n21:20.440 --> 21:23.840\n at the Federal Reserve and technology had been sort of\n\n21:23.840 --> 21:26.480\n fermenting in a way that came together with the internet.\n\n21:26.480 --> 21:30.040\n And Netscape made it possible to do pets.com,\n\n21:30.040 --> 21:34.280\n to do eBay, to get people to recognize a URL on a billboard\n\n21:34.280 --> 21:36.040\n and then type it in when they get home.\n\n21:36.040 --> 21:36.980\n And that was huge.\n\n21:38.280 --> 21:42.120\n That was so fast moving a rocket that Marc\n\n21:42.120 --> 21:45.060\n and the engineering team there thought,\n\n21:45.060 --> 21:47.920\n we need to make this a programmable browser,\n\n21:47.920 --> 21:50.840\n not just a document viewer, not just a video.\n\n21:50.840 --> 21:54.120\n It was all HTML with images and tables and also,\n\n21:54.120 --> 21:55.320\n like you said, frames.\n\n21:55.320 --> 21:57.800\n There was no dynamic element at all.\n\n21:57.800 --> 21:59.680\n Yeah, the most dynamism we get was from a plugin,\n\n21:59.680 --> 22:01.640\n which there are a few of them then.\n\n22:01.640 --> 22:03.960\n Flash didn't exist at that point.\n\n22:03.960 --> 22:04.940\n It was, I think.\n\n22:05.960 --> 22:07.400\n Java Applets yet or no?\n\n22:07.400 --> 22:09.440\n Well, that's the thing we did to deal with Sun.\n\n22:09.440 --> 22:12.600\n In fact, I was recruited to go do Scheme in the browser.\n\n22:12.600 --> 22:14.800\n Remember Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman's\n\n22:14.800 --> 22:16.760\n beautiful Lisp variant?\n\n22:16.760 --> 22:17.920\n I was gonna do it in the browser\n\n22:17.920 --> 22:19.480\n because my friends from SG, I thought,\n\n22:19.480 --> 22:20.920\n hey, we like Scheme, you like Scheme.\n\n22:20.920 --> 22:22.140\n And I'm like, I hardly ever use Scheme.\n\n22:22.140 --> 22:23.360\n It's not really used in industry,\n\n22:23.360 --> 22:27.080\n except in sort of silos, but I like it.\n\n22:27.080 --> 22:29.760\n Okay, I'll come do Scheme in the browser.\n\n22:29.760 --> 22:32.720\n I have a slide from my 2017 talk\n\n22:32.720 --> 22:34.640\n where I have Bruce Willis crawling through the duct\n\n22:34.640 --> 22:35.480\n in Die Hard.\n\n22:35.480 --> 22:38.300\n He's like, come out to the coast, have a lot of fun.\n\n22:38.300 --> 22:40.560\n Come on, do Scheme in the browser.\n\n22:40.560 --> 22:42.160\n But when I got there, there was no Scheme in the browser\n\n22:42.160 --> 22:45.240\n because they'd started a deal with Sun Microsystems.\n\n22:45.240 --> 22:47.040\n And my best contact there was Bill Joy,\n\n22:47.040 --> 22:48.960\n who I admired as a Berkeley Unix founder.\n\n22:48.960 --> 22:50.600\n And, you know, Sun founder.\n\n22:50.600 --> 22:53.920\n And Bill got the idea of making the browser programmable too.\n\n22:53.920 --> 22:57.240\n And so the main idea was to put the Java VM,\n\n22:57.240 --> 23:00.400\n which at that point was not really easy to embed,\n\n23:00.400 --> 23:04.280\n into Netscape, including the Netscape version on Windows\n\n23:04.280 --> 23:05.660\n that was still most popular,\n\n23:05.660 --> 23:09.560\n which was the 16 bit Windows 3.1, which was going away.\n\n23:09.560 --> 23:11.360\n Microsoft was coming out with Windows 95\n\n23:11.360 --> 23:13.620\n and everyone was afraid they were gonna do\n\n23:13.620 --> 23:16.200\n Internet Explorer, I guess, two at that point,\n\n23:16.200 --> 23:17.080\n three the next year.\n\n23:17.080 --> 23:20.960\n They already bought or invested in somehow Spyglass,\n\n23:20.960 --> 23:24.440\n this other company that shot out from NCSA\n\n23:24.440 --> 23:26.000\n at University of Illinois.\n\n23:26.000 --> 23:29.740\n And in fact, Microsoft had tried to buy Netscape\n\n23:29.740 --> 23:31.400\n in late 94, before I got there.\n\n23:31.400 --> 23:32.280\n And I heard about this later.\n\n23:32.280 --> 23:35.040\n I heard they offered way too little money.\n\n23:35.040 --> 23:37.480\n And so, you know, Jim Barksdale and Jim Clark said,\n\n23:37.480 --> 23:39.820\n get out of here, you know, pound sand.\n\n23:39.820 --> 23:43.780\n But then they realized, oh, this is going to hurt us\n\n23:43.780 --> 23:45.520\n because now they're gonna copy us.\n\n23:45.520 --> 23:46.340\n Didn't happen right away.\n\n23:46.340 --> 23:49.080\n I'm not sure when Gates internet title wave memo\n\n23:49.080 --> 23:50.240\n was written.\n\n23:50.240 --> 23:53.180\n That's the famous memo he wrote when Bill Gates realized\n\n23:53.180 --> 23:56.840\n that Microsoft was going down this old copy AOL path\n\n23:56.840 --> 24:01.100\n or copy CompuServe path, a project called Blackbird,\n\n24:01.100 --> 24:03.240\n presumably after the SR71, I don't know.\n\n24:03.240 --> 24:04.680\n But they were gonna make a, you know,\n\n24:04.680 --> 24:07.600\n dial up service with a custom content language stack\n\n24:07.600 --> 24:09.040\n and custom rendering.\n\n24:09.040 --> 24:10.680\n It wasn't the web.\n\n24:10.680 --> 24:13.200\n You know, they could have content partners.\n\n24:13.200 --> 24:14.400\n They have a lot of money,\n\n24:14.400 --> 24:15.920\n but it still wasn't to scale the web.\n\n24:15.920 --> 24:16.880\n It wasn't gonna be compelling.\n\n24:16.880 --> 24:18.200\n And Gates realized this,\n\n24:18.200 --> 24:20.000\n and he turned the company on a dime\n\n24:20.000 --> 24:22.400\n and they couldn't buy Netscape.\n\n24:22.400 --> 24:23.320\n Again, I'm not sure the timing,\n\n24:23.320 --> 24:24.540\n so they decided to copy it.\n\n24:24.540 --> 24:27.400\n And once we realized that everybody inside Netscape\n\n24:27.400 --> 24:30.920\n felt even more urgency and more of a frenetic mood.\n\n24:30.920 --> 24:33.620\n And so my chance to do scheme disappeared\n\n24:33.620 --> 24:35.840\n when the Java deal started brewing.\n\n24:35.840 --> 24:38.800\n But there was still a chance to do a companion language\n\n24:38.800 --> 24:41.080\n to Java because Java was a compiled,\n\n24:41.080 --> 24:42.620\n is a compiled language.\n\n24:42.620 --> 24:44.960\n It's evolved and improved quite a lot since then too,\n\n24:44.960 --> 24:48.560\n but it was for sort of serious advanced programmers\n\n24:48.560 --> 24:51.400\n that cost a certain salary or hourly rate.\n\n24:51.400 --> 24:53.880\n And people observed, Bill Joy observed,\n\n24:53.880 --> 24:55.760\n and Mark Andreessen and I observed\n\n24:55.760 --> 24:57.900\n that in a mature stack like Microsoft,\n\n24:57.900 --> 25:00.020\n you really benefit from having a scripting language\n\n25:00.020 --> 25:01.680\n like Visual Basic,\n\n25:01.680 --> 25:03.680\n which became Visual Basic script in IE3,\n\n25:03.680 --> 25:07.120\n but didn't take over and kill JavaScript,\n\n25:07.120 --> 25:08.340\n that you need two languages.\n\n25:08.340 --> 25:10.160\n One is for the component writers\n\n25:10.160 --> 25:12.560\n who are higher price and more expert.\n\n25:12.560 --> 25:17.000\n And the other is for scripters,\n\n25:17.000 --> 25:19.480\n certified public accountants, designers,\n\n25:19.480 --> 25:21.720\n graphic designers with some programming inclination,\n\n25:21.720 --> 25:23.460\n anybody, amateurs, doesn't matter.\n\n25:23.460 --> 25:26.600\n There's a much more demotic approach there\n\n25:26.600 --> 25:28.660\n for programming the components together,\n\n25:28.660 --> 25:29.880\n gluing them together.\n\n25:29.880 --> 25:32.800\n Some people say duct tape language, which I don't really like.\n\n25:32.800 --> 25:36.080\n But we saw, Bill Joy and Mark Andreessen and I,\n\n25:36.080 --> 25:38.020\n we saw the need for a companion language.\n\n25:38.020 --> 25:40.400\n And the gleam in our eye was to call it JavaScript.\n\n25:40.400 --> 25:42.480\n I didn't like it, that was marketing's plan.\n\n25:42.480 --> 25:45.080\n Mark called it Mocha, which I liked.\n\n25:45.080 --> 25:47.080\n And Netscape Marketing, I think, didn't like that.\n\n25:47.080 --> 25:48.520\n So they said, oh, there's some trademark\n\n25:48.520 --> 25:50.800\n and some software somewhere that uses Mocha,\n\n25:50.800 --> 25:52.000\n so we can't use that.\n\n25:52.000 --> 25:54.960\n And they tried LiveScript in August and that didn't last.\n\n25:54.960 --> 25:56.680\n And then finally we got the trademark license\n\n25:56.680 --> 25:58.720\n in December 1995.\n\n25:58.720 --> 26:01.600\n But the work I did to prove that it could be done\n\n26:01.600 --> 26:05.200\n was important because I came in in April\n\n26:05.200 --> 26:08.320\n and even then Netscape was growing so fast\n\n26:08.320 --> 26:11.280\n that they couldn't find an open hiring requisition\n\n26:11.280 --> 26:12.320\n in the client team for me.\n\n26:12.320 --> 26:14.280\n So they hired me into the server team.\n\n26:14.280 --> 26:16.680\n And I worked for a month on server team\n\n26:16.680 --> 26:18.600\n on what became HTTP 1.1.\n\n26:18.600 --> 26:20.280\n So I was actually, I had done protocol work\n\n26:20.280 --> 26:22.640\n at Silicon Graphics with Greg Chesson,\n\n26:22.640 --> 26:25.360\n former Bell Labs intern, grad student intern\n\n26:25.360 --> 26:27.020\n who knew all the Unix founders.\n\n26:27.020 --> 26:30.880\n And Greg was very interested in taking protocols\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:32.840\n to the next level with VLSI,\n\n26:32.840 --> 26:35.640\n because he thought that CPUs wouldn't scale up.\n\n26:35.640 --> 26:37.480\n He was mistaken in that, unfortunately.\n\n26:37.480 --> 26:39.060\n Moore's law more than kept up.\n\n26:39.060 --> 26:41.400\n And you have gigabit ethernet running\n\n26:41.400 --> 26:42.520\n with conventional processors.\n\n26:42.520 --> 26:45.680\n But I worked on protocols at SGI\n\n26:45.680 --> 26:49.000\n as well as Unix kernel hacking and NFS and things like that.\n\n26:49.000 --> 26:53.040\n So I came into Netscape to work on the server side\n\n26:53.040 --> 26:55.260\n for a month, but I was thinking the whole time,\n\n26:55.260 --> 26:56.360\n what should this language be like?\n\n26:56.360 --> 26:58.480\n Should it be easy to use?\n\n26:58.480 --> 27:00.680\n Might its syntax even be more like natural language\n\n27:00.680 --> 27:04.840\n like HyperTalk, which is Bill Atkinson's language\n\n27:04.840 --> 27:08.560\n in HyperCard, if you ever used HyperCard on an early Mac.\n\n27:08.560 --> 27:12.080\n And I thought, well, I'd like to do that,\n\n27:12.080 --> 27:15.160\n but my management is saying, make it look like Java,\n\n27:15.160 --> 27:17.480\n which looks like C from a distance.\n\n27:17.480 --> 27:18.320\n What does that mean?\n\n27:18.320 --> 27:19.280\n Is it braces?\n\n27:19.280 --> 27:20.400\n We're talking about visually?\n\n27:20.400 --> 27:23.060\n Does that mean like, management,\n\n27:23.060 --> 27:24.640\n do they understand what they think about?\n\n27:24.640 --> 27:26.560\n Marketing didn't know, but management did.\n\n27:26.560 --> 27:28.800\n Like Rick Schell, the VP of engineering, knew.\n\n27:29.680 --> 27:31.720\n And we had a plan even that was,\n\n27:31.720 --> 27:32.920\n if you have this companion language,\n\n27:32.920 --> 27:34.560\n you're going to glue things together\n\n27:34.560 --> 27:35.680\n between Java and JavaScript.\n\n27:35.680 --> 27:38.800\n So you're going to have commerce in memory, in the heap\n\n27:38.800 --> 27:40.240\n with data types.\n\n27:40.240 --> 27:41.760\n So you're going to want some of the data types\n\n27:41.760 --> 27:43.880\n in Java to reflect in the JavaScript.\n\n27:43.880 --> 27:45.700\n You're going to want the primitive types\n\n27:45.700 --> 27:47.540\n that Java unfortunately separated from objects.\n\n27:47.540 --> 27:50.880\n So at least some of them, double, let's call it\n\n27:50.880 --> 27:52.560\n in Java's terms from the C term\n\n27:52.560 --> 27:54.500\n for double precision floating point,\n\n27:55.640 --> 28:00.640\n or strings or Booleans and objects.\n\n28:01.200 --> 28:04.000\n And so right away there was this constraint\n\n28:04.000 --> 28:07.920\n that looking like Java meant kind of a C curly brace syntax\n\n28:07.920 --> 28:09.800\n but also some of the data types and objects.\n\n28:09.800 --> 28:12.000\n Like objects and so on, all that kind of stuff.\n\n28:12.000 --> 28:13.000\n Comparison operator.\n\n28:13.000 --> 28:15.480\n Garbage collection, all that stuff.\n\n28:15.480 --> 28:17.640\n Even the bitwise operators and the shift operators\n\n28:17.640 --> 28:19.580\n including the unsigned right shift,\n\n28:19.580 --> 28:21.420\n which Java had because it didn't have\n\n28:21.420 --> 28:22.720\n unsigned integer types.\n\n28:22.720 --> 28:24.600\n It said, if you want to do unsigned operations,\n\n28:24.600 --> 28:25.440\n use an operator.\n\n28:25.440 --> 28:27.560\n And that turned out to be important much later.\n\n28:27.560 --> 28:28.560\n I'll tell that story five time.\n\n28:28.560 --> 28:33.560\n But JavaScript inherited a set of operators,\n\n28:35.080 --> 28:37.160\n the expression grammar, the statement grammar\n\n28:37.160 --> 28:39.360\n up to a point from Java.\n\n28:39.360 --> 28:40.720\n But I wanted a functional language.\n\n28:40.720 --> 28:42.840\n I wanted scheme, a little bit of scheme,\n\n28:42.840 --> 28:44.600\n even though it wasn't as clean as scheme.\n\n28:44.600 --> 28:45.440\n I wanted.\n\n28:45.440 --> 28:46.260\n So you had a love, sorry to interrupt.\n\n28:46.260 --> 28:47.600\n You had a love for scheme and list\n\n28:47.600 --> 28:49.760\n but that functional language landscape.\n\n28:49.760 --> 28:51.640\n Yes, I wanted first class functions\n\n28:51.640 --> 28:54.000\n because I saw the need for callbacks in the browser\n\n28:54.000 --> 28:55.880\n where it's a single threaded program.\n\n28:55.880 --> 28:57.360\n All the early browsers were single threaded\n\n28:57.360 --> 28:58.640\n and it's the right model for users.\n\n28:58.640 --> 29:00.600\n Most users weren't ready for mutual exclusion\n\n29:00.600 --> 29:01.680\n and threading.\n\n29:01.680 --> 29:03.680\n So in a single threaded world,\n\n29:03.680 --> 29:05.440\n you cannot block the user interface.\n\n29:05.440 --> 29:07.520\n So you have to use a callback and run later.\n\n29:07.520 --> 29:09.920\n And without getting too fancy\n\n29:09.920 --> 29:11.640\n and trying to capture the continuation\n\n29:11.640 --> 29:13.340\n like call CC does in scheme,\n\n29:13.340 --> 29:16.640\n I thought I'll just make it easy to have fun arcs.\n\n29:16.640 --> 29:18.860\n First class functions you pass downward\n\n29:18.860 --> 29:21.800\n and it can call back, it'd be called back.\n\n29:21.800 --> 29:23.640\n And Java didn't have that at the time.\n\n29:23.640 --> 29:27.280\n It took forever to get proper first class functions\n\n29:27.280 --> 29:30.720\n or lambdas now into Java, Java seven or eight, I think.\n\n29:30.720 --> 29:32.120\n It did have concurrency, right?\n\n29:32.120 --> 29:32.960\n Yes.\n\n29:32.960 --> 29:33.780\n From the very beginning.\n\n29:33.780 --> 29:35.680\n But you were thinking that the JavaScript\n\n29:35.680 --> 29:38.160\n in the browser would not have the luxury\n\n29:38.160 --> 29:39.360\n of being concurrent.\n\n29:39.360 --> 29:40.200\n That's right.\n\n29:40.200 --> 29:42.480\n And the reason was Java was gonna run in the plugins.\n\n29:42.480 --> 29:44.560\n So it could fork threads and go to town.\n\n29:44.560 --> 29:46.880\n But the main action in the browser\n\n29:46.880 --> 29:48.280\n was in the single threaded program,\n\n29:48.280 --> 29:51.880\n the single Unix process on Unix or Windows.\n\n29:51.880 --> 29:54.400\n And it was where you had to service the event loop\n\n29:54.400 --> 29:56.160\n and then go do things.\n\n29:56.160 --> 29:59.360\n Respond to the network layout, some HTML, render it,\n\n29:59.360 --> 30:03.200\n turn widths into heights by filling containers, boxes,\n\n30:03.200 --> 30:06.080\n the early, what became the CSS box model.\n\n30:06.080 --> 30:09.600\n And run scripts to make the thing livelier,\n\n30:09.600 --> 30:11.160\n respond to user input.\n\n30:11.160 --> 30:14.240\n And all that event driven programming\n\n30:14.240 --> 30:16.080\n was in part like HyperCard\n\n30:16.080 --> 30:19.440\n because HyperCard had this on event name syntax.\n\n30:19.440 --> 30:21.680\n And so that's why you have in JavaScript on click\n\n30:21.680 --> 30:24.120\n run together as the name of the event handler.\n\n30:24.120 --> 30:26.060\n And there's some funny ones on mouse over\n\n30:26.060 --> 30:28.200\n and on mouse out, people still complain about those.\n\n30:28.200 --> 30:31.060\n But there were many more events now over the years\n\n30:31.060 --> 30:33.980\n standardized, but it was a mix of event driven\n\n30:33.980 --> 30:36.240\n single threaded programming because it had to run\n\n30:36.240 --> 30:38.960\n in the main thread of the browser where the action is\n\n30:38.960 --> 30:40.680\n and Java never got there.\n\n30:40.680 --> 30:42.640\n Which meant Java could not interact easily\n\n30:42.640 --> 30:46.720\n or quickly or in a nested way with the document,\n\n30:46.720 --> 30:49.200\n with the objects reflected from the HTML document,\n\n30:49.200 --> 30:50.960\n with the tables and forms and so on.\n\n30:50.960 --> 30:53.960\n And that is one of the reasons I think JavaScript\n\n30:53.960 --> 30:55.320\n survived and Java kind of died.\n\n30:55.320 --> 30:56.960\n Java was in this plugin prison.\n\n30:56.960 --> 30:58.760\n It essentially was confined to a rectangle,\n\n30:58.760 --> 30:59.960\n the applet rectangle.\n\n30:59.960 --> 31:02.720\n And while we even built next year,\n\n31:02.720 --> 31:04.840\n Nick Thompson, a friend from SGI\n\n31:04.840 --> 31:08.640\n who was an intern grad student at CMU at the time,\n\n31:08.640 --> 31:10.280\n built the first version of Live Connect\n\n31:10.280 --> 31:12.640\n to glue Java and JavaScript together\n\n31:12.640 --> 31:14.680\n to deliver on that vision where you do have commerce\n\n31:14.680 --> 31:16.840\n between the data types in the heap.\n\n31:18.040 --> 31:18.880\n Did it work?\n\n31:18.880 --> 31:21.280\n It worked, but Java was in charge.\n\n31:21.280 --> 31:23.640\n JavaScript was in charge and Java was just these components,\n\n31:23.640 --> 31:24.480\n these helper objects.\n\n31:24.480 --> 31:25.920\n You might as well do everything in JavaScript.\n\n31:25.920 --> 31:27.960\n What happened over time, it's like an evolutionary filter.\n\n31:27.960 --> 31:29.600\n It just kind of, who needs the plugin?\n\n31:29.600 --> 31:33.000\n And in fact, Sun mismanaged Java as a plugin.\n\n31:33.000 --> 31:35.520\n They thought, oh, Netscape is giving us\n\n31:35.520 --> 31:38.400\n the distribution vehicle and we don't care about the browser.\n\n31:38.400 --> 31:39.680\n It's just about getting Java out there.\n\n31:39.680 --> 31:41.220\n And that was a big miscalculation.\n\n31:41.220 --> 31:43.840\n They then tried, because Microsoft's killing Netscape\n\n31:43.840 --> 31:46.120\n after years, they tried getting into Microsoft.\n\n31:46.120 --> 31:48.520\n And you may remember there was a Sun Microsoft deal\n\n31:48.520 --> 31:50.640\n which famously blew up.\n\n31:50.640 --> 31:54.800\n And Microsoft kicked Java out of Windows.\n\n31:54.800 --> 31:56.400\n And that's when they really pulled the trigger.\n\n31:56.400 --> 31:58.120\n I think they'd already evaluated it and liked it\n\n31:58.120 --> 32:01.740\n on Anders Helzberg's.NET and C Sharp\n\n32:01.740 --> 32:04.160\n and decided we're gonna just not have Java.\n\n32:04.160 --> 32:06.440\n We don't want any of that Sun stuff.\n\n32:06.440 --> 32:07.560\n We don't want the patent risk.\n\n32:07.560 --> 32:10.080\n We don't want, I'm not sure what all fights were about.\n\n32:10.080 --> 32:12.040\n There was some patent angle to it, I think.\n\n32:12.040 --> 32:16.920\n And up till then, Microsoft had been using Java components\n\n32:16.920 --> 32:19.240\n like in Outlook Web Access,\n\n32:19.240 --> 32:21.480\n which had a lot of JavaScript to be a webmail\n\n32:21.480 --> 32:23.120\n like Hotmail, like user interface.\n\n32:23.120 --> 32:27.760\n They had to call the mail server through HTTP\n\n32:27.760 --> 32:31.360\n and they used a Java object to do this.\n\n32:31.360 --> 32:34.280\n And when they gave the boot to Sun,\n\n32:34.280 --> 32:37.240\n suddenly the left hand gave the boot\n\n32:37.240 --> 32:39.160\n and the right hand said, we better do something else\n\n32:39.160 --> 32:40.080\n in Outlook Web Access.\n\n32:40.080 --> 32:40.920\n What are we gonna do?\n\n32:40.920 --> 32:43.640\n And they said, let's just add an ActiveX component,\n\n32:43.640 --> 32:46.300\n which is their own native way of embedding things\n\n32:46.300 --> 32:51.300\n in languages and it'll be what became XML HTTP request,\n\n32:51.960 --> 32:54.760\n which is now a web standard for calling asynchronously.\n\n32:54.760 --> 32:57.040\n And it's been replaced by the fetch API\n\n32:57.040 --> 32:59.480\n in HTML5 or HTML living document.\n\n32:59.480 --> 33:02.400\n But this whole lineage goes back to Java\n\n33:02.400 --> 33:05.100\n being successfully the loser and getting kicked out.\n\n33:05.100 --> 33:07.680\n And after Microsoft kicked it out, it was a plugin\n\n33:07.680 --> 33:11.040\n and you would find it required for like smart card banking\n\n33:11.040 --> 33:14.700\n in the Nordic countries where that was mandated by law,\n\n33:14.700 --> 33:16.360\n but really didn't get used much.\n\n33:16.360 --> 33:20.600\n Or there were pilots who used it for flight information,\n\n33:21.560 --> 33:24.160\n but Flash, which Netscape could have bought,\n\n33:24.160 --> 33:25.560\n but fortunately didn't.\n\n33:25.560 --> 33:26.400\n The early days.\n\n33:26.400 --> 33:28.080\n Yeah, we would have screwed it up.\n\n33:28.080 --> 33:29.520\n What year are we talking about with Flash?\n\n33:29.520 --> 33:32.160\n I think after the IPO, so it was probably late 95.\n\n33:32.160 --> 33:33.320\n Oh, Flash was around.\n\n33:33.320 --> 33:34.160\n Was it Adobe?\n\n33:34.160 --> 33:34.980\n No, it wasn't.\n\n33:34.980 --> 33:36.360\n No, it was called Future Splash\n\n33:36.360 --> 33:38.720\n and it was these brothers, Jonathan Gay,\n\n33:38.720 --> 33:41.720\n I think his name was, and he came knocking\n\n33:41.720 --> 33:43.520\n and the marketing guy at Netscape,\n\n33:43.520 --> 33:45.840\n who was screening the technology partners\n\n33:45.840 --> 33:47.800\n or wannabe acquisitions was brutal\n\n33:47.800 --> 33:50.320\n and just everybody wanted to get in on the Netscape,\n\n33:50.320 --> 33:52.480\n stock gravy train and he sent them packing\n\n33:52.480 --> 33:55.120\n and they ended up selling to Macromedia\n\n33:55.120 --> 33:57.320\n and Macromedia was where Flash was created.\n\n33:57.320 --> 33:58.960\n And the good thing about Macromedia was\n\n33:58.960 --> 34:02.000\n it was a tool company.\n\n34:02.000 --> 34:05.800\n So it invested in the best ideas, I think,\n\n34:05.800 --> 34:08.120\n which are still somewhat lost to us of Flash,\n\n34:08.120 --> 34:12.500\n the timeline, animation has sort of been a mutable function\n\n34:12.500 --> 34:13.800\n over time.\n\n34:13.800 --> 34:14.920\n They had the tooling around that too,\n\n34:14.920 --> 34:17.240\n like they had Dreamweaver, there's a Flash.\n\n34:17.240 --> 34:18.840\n Flash Director, there were a bunch of them.\n\n34:18.840 --> 34:20.840\n Yeah, I mean, yeah, that was a great.\n\n34:20.840 --> 34:22.800\n Flash Builder was one of the last ones.\n\n34:22.800 --> 34:25.420\n These tools were used by real artists\n\n34:25.420 --> 34:27.440\n and special effects people and designers.\n\n34:27.440 --> 34:29.760\n All the restaurant websites around 2005\n\n34:29.760 --> 34:32.280\n were done in Flash, which was,\n\n34:32.280 --> 34:34.080\n we were trying to do HTML5 at the same time.\n\n34:34.080 --> 34:35.080\n That was the Firefox era.\n\n34:35.080 --> 34:37.640\n We were trying to make the web capable enough\n\n34:37.640 --> 34:39.400\n you didn't need Flash, but if you recall,\n\n34:39.400 --> 34:41.080\n you go to a restaurant and it's like,\n\n34:41.080 --> 34:42.400\n this is kind of like a game or something.\n\n34:42.400 --> 34:44.600\n It's like a Flash, all the font looks small.\n\n34:44.600 --> 34:45.880\n So you didn't like Flash from the beginning.\n\n34:45.880 --> 34:47.640\n You're like, this doesn't feel right.\n\n34:47.640 --> 34:48.480\n Not really.\n\n34:48.480 --> 34:50.000\n I actually admire Flash's technology\n\n34:50.000 --> 34:51.700\n and I'm pretty pragmatic about these things.\n\n34:51.700 --> 34:54.840\n And I realized that it doesn't matter\n\n34:54.840 --> 34:58.280\n if your Delta bad hand like JavaScript was a rush job,\n\n34:58.280 --> 35:00.240\n or if you have Flash as a plugin\n\n35:00.240 --> 35:03.620\n and you can invest in the tools and make it pretty good.\n\n35:03.620 --> 35:05.720\n You should make it better for your users\n\n35:05.720 --> 35:07.000\n and grow it as best you can.\n\n35:07.000 --> 35:08.800\n And what happened with the browser\n\n35:08.800 --> 35:11.040\n due to Microsoft's monopoly abuse\n\n35:11.040 --> 35:12.600\n for which they were convicted.\n\n35:12.600 --> 35:17.440\n And even after that, until I think Firefox and then Chrome\n\n35:17.440 --> 35:21.240\n was people kept saying, oh, the web can't do X, can't do Y.\n\n35:21.240 --> 35:22.240\n We'll have to have a plugin.\n\n35:22.240 --> 35:23.680\n We'll have to have a new approach.\n\n35:23.680 --> 35:26.860\n We'll clean the slate and have a new web.\n\n35:26.860 --> 35:28.960\n And everyone who said that failed.\n\n35:28.960 --> 35:30.180\n And the reason they failed is because\n\n35:30.180 --> 35:34.080\n there's too much value in the web, this huge network.\n\n35:34.080 --> 35:36.040\n And the worse is better principle means\n\n35:36.040 --> 35:39.460\n that you can not only start bad, which they all sneer at,\n\n35:39.460 --> 35:41.920\n but get on first and get wide distribution,\n\n35:41.920 --> 35:46.920\n get sort of evolutionary advantage in priority of place,\n\n35:47.080 --> 35:49.320\n but you can also improve it over time.\n\n35:49.320 --> 35:51.080\n And so if you're gonna improve Flash,\n\n35:51.080 --> 35:53.000\n and for some reason Flash is now out of favor.\n\n35:53.000 --> 35:55.000\n Steve Jobs said you can't have Flash on the iPhone.\n\n35:55.000 --> 35:56.740\n That was probably the death knell.\n\n35:56.740 --> 35:58.100\n Put your energy into JavaScript.\n\n35:58.100 --> 35:58.940\n And that happened, right?\n\n35:58.940 --> 36:02.400\n So we did things at Mozilla with Adobe to improve,\n\n36:02.400 --> 36:04.860\n which bought my Macromedia, to improve Flash\n\n36:04.860 --> 36:07.560\n and to improve the version of JavaScript that was in Flash.\n\n36:07.560 --> 36:09.000\n We tried to standardize that.\n\n36:09.000 --> 36:09.840\n Oh, that's right.\n\n36:09.840 --> 36:10.660\n I'm getting ahead of myself with it.\n\n36:10.660 --> 36:11.500\n It was ES4.\n\n36:11.500 --> 36:12.340\n Yeah.\n\n36:12.340 --> 36:13.180\n That's right, that's right.\n\n36:13.180 --> 36:17.000\n Can we just rewind to the magical, like, you know.\n\n36:17.000 --> 36:20.160\n It's a special moment in the history of all of computing.\n\n36:20.160 --> 36:22.840\n We'll talk about it later, but it's arguable.\n\n36:22.840 --> 36:25.280\n It's possible that the entirety of the world\n\n36:25.280 --> 36:27.280\n will run in JavaScript at some point.\n\n36:27.280 --> 36:30.040\n So like, it's like those days,\n\n36:30.040 --> 36:33.320\n it would be interesting if you could just describe,\n\n36:33.320 --> 36:38.320\n actually zooming in on how the cake was baked\n\n36:38.320 --> 36:41.580\n from the several days that you were working on it.\n\n36:41.580 --> 36:43.320\n What was on your mind?\n\n36:43.320 --> 36:45.380\n How much coffee were you drinking?\n\n36:45.380 --> 36:46.220\n Were you nervous?\n\n36:46.220 --> 36:47.360\n Why, freaking out?\n\n36:47.360 --> 36:48.360\n I'll try to remember it.\n\n36:48.360 --> 36:49.200\n I mean, you're right.\n\n36:49.200 --> 36:50.940\n There are these pregnant moments you see in hindsight,\n\n36:50.940 --> 36:52.200\n maybe they're overrated,\n\n36:52.200 --> 36:55.760\n but like Hegel sees Napoleon on horseback at Jena\n\n36:55.760 --> 36:59.120\n and says, there's the world spirit on horse.\n\n37:00.440 --> 37:04.120\n And I knew that there was a chance to do it.\n\n37:04.120 --> 37:07.960\n Mark knew, and he was my executive sponsor\n\n37:07.960 --> 37:10.800\n and he was the one sort of brainstorming\n\n37:10.800 --> 37:13.360\n how the JavaScript should be right there in the page.\n\n37:13.360 --> 37:14.760\n That was important for him to say that.\n\n37:14.760 --> 37:17.360\n Cause I thought so too, but a lot of people were like,\n\n37:17.360 --> 37:18.680\n well, you can't write programming language\n\n37:18.680 --> 37:20.120\n in the middle of the markup.\n\n37:20.120 --> 37:21.040\n And indeed there are problems.\n\n37:21.040 --> 37:23.600\n If you did it naively, you'd see the code laid out\n\n37:23.600 --> 37:25.300\n as like random gibberish.\n\n37:25.300 --> 37:26.600\n So I had to figure out how to hide that.\n\n37:26.600 --> 37:28.120\n That was a challenge.\n\n37:28.120 --> 37:29.800\n Is that a breakthrough idea?\n\n37:29.800 --> 37:32.580\n I mean, so you and Mark thinking about this idea\n\n37:32.580 --> 37:36.080\n that you just inject code in the middle of the markup.\n\n37:36.080 --> 37:36.920\n Of the webpage.\n\n37:36.920 --> 37:38.000\n I consider kind of heretical.\n\n37:38.000 --> 37:40.120\n There was an SGML guru, I forget his name,\n\n37:40.120 --> 37:42.120\n but he corresponded with me and at first he was angry.\n\n37:42.120 --> 37:44.760\n He's like, you should have used a marked section.\n\n37:44.760 --> 37:45.960\n Why didn't you use a marked section?\n\n37:45.960 --> 37:48.600\n And I said, well, SGML marked sections are not part of HTML\n\n37:48.600 --> 37:50.600\n by the way, and they're not supported in the browser.\n\n37:50.600 --> 37:52.540\n And so I did some hack that was equivalent\n\n37:52.540 --> 37:55.280\n and over time you could do the proper SGML thing.\n\n37:55.280 --> 37:58.200\n But eventually he came around and it was again,\n\n37:58.200 --> 37:59.640\n sort of evolutionary necessity.\n\n37:59.640 --> 38:02.920\n It was almost like introgression, like the idea\n\n38:02.920 --> 38:06.980\n which Lynn Margulies, I think helped get across\n\n38:06.980 --> 38:10.640\n that we have to consider mutualism biology\n\n38:10.640 --> 38:14.080\n that maybe mitochondria were ancient prokaryotes\n\n38:14.080 --> 38:17.420\n that got into the cell and became beneficial.\n\n38:17.420 --> 38:21.200\n Somehow the same sort of thinking applies.\n\n38:21.200 --> 38:23.040\n You have to embed JavaScript in HTML.\n\n38:23.040 --> 38:24.760\n It's gonna be a good virus.\n\n38:24.760 --> 38:25.720\n It won't hurt you.\n\n38:25.720 --> 38:27.400\n The code becomes data in the sense\n\n38:27.400 --> 38:30.040\n it just gets carried along.\n\n38:30.040 --> 38:33.680\n But is there the side of the, so you were focusing\n\n38:33.680 --> 38:35.080\n on Netscape at that time.\n\n38:35.080 --> 38:38.360\n Doesn't the browser have to support interpret correctly\n\n38:38.360 --> 38:41.440\n this mix of HTML and whatever code?\n\n38:41.440 --> 38:42.720\n I had to hide it from old browsers,\n\n38:42.720 --> 38:45.140\n including Netscape 1.1, which was predominant then.\n\n38:45.140 --> 38:49.560\n So I used an HTML comment, but the inside the container\n\n38:49.560 --> 38:51.080\n that comment lived in the script tag,\n\n38:51.080 --> 38:53.480\n which is a new element, I could make different semantics\n\n38:53.480 --> 38:57.040\n in Netscape 2 where those HTML comment delimiters\n\n38:57.040 --> 38:59.760\n instead of being multi line brackets became one line\n\n38:59.760 --> 39:00.600\n or essentially one line.\n\n39:00.600 --> 39:02.600\n So you wrote, so JavaScript was written,\n\n39:02.600 --> 39:05.080\n the programming language was written as a comment.\n\n39:05.080 --> 39:08.120\n A comment for old browsers and a set of brackets\n\n39:08.120 --> 39:10.160\n that were ignored with real code for new.\n\n39:10.160 --> 39:13.480\n And it was this two way comment hiding hack, as I called it,\n\n39:13.480 --> 39:15.700\n that was absolutely necessary for us to get off the ground.\n\n39:15.700 --> 39:17.680\n We couldn't have bootstrapped JavaScript without it.\n\n39:17.680 --> 39:20.240\n We didn't have scripts that were loaded from a separate file.\n\n39:20.240 --> 39:22.900\n The only scripts in Netscape 2 were inline in the document.\n\n39:22.900 --> 39:24.280\n What were the challenges here?\n\n39:24.280 --> 39:27.440\n What, like what, you know, typing,\n\n39:27.440 --> 39:30.120\n what were the choices you were thinking about?\n\n39:30.120 --> 39:31.560\n What was the design for this garbage collection?\n\n39:31.560 --> 39:32.960\n I didn't have time to write a garbage collector.\n\n39:32.960 --> 39:34.680\n So I just, I didn't at first.\n\n39:34.680 --> 39:36.920\n The thing was using essentially arenas\n\n39:36.920 --> 39:39.160\n or what GNU calls object pools\n\n39:39.160 --> 39:41.680\n and just would run out of memory eventually.\n\n39:41.680 --> 39:43.560\n And I added reference counting in a hurry\n\n39:43.560 --> 39:45.340\n after the 10 days in which I hacked.\n\n39:45.340 --> 39:48.120\n So after I was in the server team doing HTTP 1.1\n\n39:48.120 --> 39:49.640\n and thinking about the language,\n\n39:49.640 --> 39:52.300\n I finally got transferred to the client team in early May.\n\n39:52.300 --> 39:55.260\n And that's when I, you know, I got the go sign from Mark\n\n39:55.260 --> 39:57.280\n and it was like, we can't wait\n\n39:57.280 --> 39:59.360\n because people inside Netscape are doubting.\n\n39:59.360 --> 40:01.880\n Even people inside Sun are definitely doubting.\n\n40:01.880 --> 40:04.960\n Bill Joy was the champion, but he was like alone in that\n\n40:04.960 --> 40:07.260\n in seeing that there was a role for JavaScript\n\n40:07.260 --> 40:10.560\n as the, as I call it, the sidekick language,\n\n40:10.560 --> 40:12.720\n robbing the boy hostage.\n\n40:12.720 --> 40:16.360\n Frank Miller put it in the Dark Knight Returns\n\n40:16.360 --> 40:18.640\n that there was this silly little language\n\n40:18.640 --> 40:19.520\n that would be the glue language\n\n40:19.520 --> 40:20.960\n and it could become important over time.\n\n40:20.960 --> 40:23.880\n And you were better off having that complementarity,\n\n40:23.880 --> 40:25.120\n that pairing of languages,\n\n40:25.120 --> 40:28.080\n just like Microsoft stacked it with visual C plus plus\n\n40:28.080 --> 40:28.900\n and visual pacing.\n\n40:28.900 --> 40:33.120\n So what was the big moment of I'm done?\n\n40:33.120 --> 40:34.320\n So I had to do a demo.\n\n40:34.320 --> 40:35.800\n I forget the dates.\n\n40:35.800 --> 40:38.680\n I think I, for a history of programming languages paper\n\n40:38.680 --> 40:40.840\n that Alan Wiersbrock did with my help,\n\n40:40.840 --> 40:42.760\n he did a lot of the writing.\n\n40:42.760 --> 40:47.440\n I think it was the 10 days from like Thursday evening\n\n40:47.440 --> 40:50.800\n through to the following weeks, you know,\n\n40:50.800 --> 40:52.520\n the whole of that week and then into the Monday.\n\n40:52.520 --> 40:53.360\n You get sleep?\n\n40:53.360 --> 40:54.400\n Not enough.\n\n40:54.400 --> 40:56.280\n And I was really going fast\n\n40:56.280 --> 41:00.080\n because I had already used a lot of C compiler\n\n41:00.080 --> 41:02.320\n and front end compiler knowledge\n\n41:02.320 --> 41:04.700\n that I'd gained from undergraduate school.\n\n41:04.700 --> 41:06.600\n When I started getting into computing\n\n41:07.560 --> 41:10.040\n as a renegade physics major,\n\n41:10.040 --> 41:14.640\n people were formalizing more efficient bottom up grammars,\n\n41:14.640 --> 41:17.040\n parsers for bottom up languages,\n\n41:17.040 --> 41:19.520\n really LALR one was the big thing.\n\n41:19.520 --> 41:22.440\n And I studied all this and learned how to parse them.\n\n41:22.440 --> 41:25.100\n And in the end, if you're doing C languages,\n\n41:25.100 --> 41:28.640\n you often do what Dennis Ritchie did anyway,\n\n41:28.640 --> 41:31.280\n which is the recursive descent parser.\n\n41:31.280 --> 41:32.200\n You can hand code it.\n\n41:32.200 --> 41:36.280\n And I did that for JavaScript in a blazing hurry,\n\n41:36.280 --> 41:37.280\n mostly got it right.\n\n41:37.280 --> 41:40.160\n I didn't have precedence inversion problems or other bugs,\n\n41:40.160 --> 41:43.160\n but I copied a lot from Java and C.\n\n41:43.160 --> 41:45.240\n And I tried to keep things simple,\n\n41:45.240 --> 41:49.400\n like the equality operator in those 10 days sprint\n\n41:49.400 --> 41:52.360\n between two objects of different dynamic type said,\n\n41:52.360 --> 41:54.320\n no, they're not equal, their types are different.\n\n41:54.320 --> 41:57.680\n And then after that, I had internal early adopters\n\n41:57.680 --> 42:01.240\n and they were using JavaScript to match a number\n\n42:01.240 --> 42:03.920\n against a database field that had been stringized.\n\n42:03.920 --> 42:06.440\n And they said, oh, can we just have implicit conversion?\n\n42:06.440 --> 42:07.720\n Like an idiot, I agreed.\n\n42:07.720 --> 42:08.640\n I gave them what they wanted.\n\n42:08.640 --> 42:10.680\n I was trying to please them and get adoption.\n\n42:10.680 --> 42:15.200\n And that broke what equivalence relation\n\n42:16.560 --> 42:19.600\n nature there was to the double equal.\n\n42:19.600 --> 42:22.360\n There's some edge cases with not a number\n\n42:22.360 --> 42:25.040\n that break that too, but it really broke it.\n\n42:25.040 --> 42:26.960\n Having an implicit conversions in the operator\n\n42:26.960 --> 42:29.360\n is something that people still roast me over.\n\n42:29.360 --> 42:31.720\n So let's talk about two things.\n\n42:31.720 --> 42:34.280\n One, it sounds like the comparison operator,\n\n42:34.280 --> 42:38.760\n the equality operator is the thing that you regret.\n\n42:38.760 --> 42:39.600\n So maybe you can.\n\n42:39.600 --> 42:40.600\n Making it sloppy.\n\n42:40.600 --> 42:41.440\n Making it sloppy.\n\n42:41.440 --> 42:45.200\n So what is the biggest thing you regret in those 10 days?\n\n42:45.200 --> 42:47.480\n And what is the biggest thing you're proud of?\n\n42:47.480 --> 42:49.680\n So that making it sloppy came after the 10 days.\n\n42:49.680 --> 42:51.880\n And my lesson there, which I've tweeted is\n\n42:51.880 --> 42:53.160\n when people come to you saying,\n\n42:53.160 --> 42:56.080\n can you please make it sloppy or add this cute feature?\n\n42:56.080 --> 42:57.640\n The answer should be no.\n\n42:57.640 --> 42:58.480\n And I should have known that\n\n42:58.480 --> 43:01.200\n because I think Nicholas Viert, one of my heroes said,\n\n43:01.200 --> 43:03.560\n the essence of design is leaving things out.\n\n43:04.560 --> 43:06.200\n But during the 10 days, I also, like I said,\n\n43:06.200 --> 43:08.560\n I was in such a hurry, I left out garbage collection,\n\n43:08.560 --> 43:10.760\n came back to haunt me, but I got reference counting in\n\n43:10.760 --> 43:13.960\n in time that people weren't running out of memory\n\n43:13.960 --> 43:16.120\n right away on long lived JavaScript.\n\n43:16.120 --> 43:17.760\n What happens when you don't have garbage collection\n\n43:17.760 --> 43:18.600\n and you have objects?\n\n43:18.600 --> 43:20.240\n Well, you just run out of memory.\n\n43:20.240 --> 43:24.120\n And you know, at first you write a short script\n\n43:24.120 --> 43:25.920\n and the page doesn't last long or it doesn't do a lot.\n\n43:25.920 --> 43:26.760\n It's okay.\n\n43:26.760 --> 43:27.600\n Oh, I see, yeah, yeah.\n\n43:27.600 --> 43:28.600\n But if you're writing a game or something\n\n43:28.600 --> 43:30.600\n and you're doing event based allocation,\n\n43:30.600 --> 43:31.680\n you run out of memory.\n\n43:31.680 --> 43:34.320\n And this was noticed in the summer of 1985\n\n43:34.320 --> 43:35.720\n and people were like, what's going on?\n\n43:35.720 --> 43:38.600\n Oh yeah, I better go back and do reference counting.\n\n43:38.600 --> 43:40.200\n And then the problem with reference counting is\n\n43:40.200 --> 43:43.160\n you're writing the language in the runtime in C,\n\n43:43.160 --> 43:45.760\n an unsafe language, and if you're reference counting\n\n43:45.760 --> 43:48.080\n and you overflow the counter, you mismanage it\n\n43:48.080 --> 43:49.640\n so it goes high, it gets stuck high,\n\n43:49.640 --> 43:51.560\n you leak memory again and you run out.\n\n43:51.560 --> 43:56.200\n If you underflow it, you pre memory that's still in use.\n\n43:56.200 --> 44:00.120\n And even then we knew what all the security hackers\n\n44:00.120 --> 44:03.000\n came to know that you therefore have potentially\n\n44:03.000 --> 44:05.840\n a remote code execution vulnerability.\n\n44:05.840 --> 44:09.800\n Cause this was before things like non executable\n\n44:09.800 --> 44:14.800\n heap memory and staff defenses against taking over memory.\n\n44:14.800 --> 44:17.780\n So if you can, from the remote side,\n\n44:17.780 --> 44:19.920\n write some HTML and JavaScript that just happens\n\n44:19.920 --> 44:21.820\n to exploit a bug in memory safety,\n\n44:21.820 --> 44:24.960\n like it causes JavaScript to underflow reference counter.\n\n44:24.960 --> 44:27.560\n And the script still has its hands on that object\n\n44:27.560 --> 44:29.040\n and it's trying to call a method on it\n\n44:29.040 --> 44:30.680\n and there's some kind of lookup function table\n\n44:30.680 --> 44:34.600\n in the object, but you've managed to stuff the heap\n\n44:34.600 --> 44:37.160\n with strings that forwards their own lookalike\n\n44:37.160 --> 44:39.720\n for the function table.\n\n44:39.720 --> 44:41.360\n You can call some other code.\n\n44:41.360 --> 44:43.400\n And this was a problem right away.\n\n44:43.400 --> 44:46.280\n So security, JavaScript upped the ante.\n\n44:46.280 --> 44:48.840\n Java had this problem too, but in its own VM.\n\n44:48.840 --> 44:53.440\n And it just was a separate headache for Sun to worry about.\n\n44:53.440 --> 44:55.280\n We had this problem in Netscape right away.\n\n44:55.280 --> 44:58.360\n So Netscape 2 came out after my 10 days\n\n44:58.360 --> 45:02.640\n and after these follow on work to embed JavaScript\n\n45:02.640 --> 45:04.480\n better in the browser and to add garbage\n\n45:04.480 --> 45:05.960\n or collection through reference counting,\n\n45:05.960 --> 45:09.640\n really I call it reference counting and get it shipped.\n\n45:09.640 --> 45:11.400\n We had a bunch of dot releases where we fixed\n\n45:11.400 --> 45:13.560\n security bugs like maniacs.\n\n45:13.560 --> 45:16.200\n But what is the thing you're, you know,\n\n45:16.200 --> 45:19.120\n when you sit back on a porch and just look out\n\n45:19.120 --> 45:21.000\n into the sunset, what are you most proud of\n\n45:21.000 --> 45:21.960\n from those 10 days?\n\n45:21.960 --> 45:23.560\n I think the first class functions shines.\n\n45:23.560 --> 45:25.600\n I think especially since Java didn't have it\n\n45:25.600 --> 45:27.600\n and it was somewhat unusual.\n\n45:27.600 --> 45:30.640\n Scheme made it in somehow at the end of the day.\n\n45:30.640 --> 45:33.440\n In spirit, I mean, people complain because Scheme has,\n\n45:33.440 --> 45:34.840\n you know, minimalism.\n\n45:34.840 --> 45:37.000\n It has, you know, six or seven special forms.\n\n45:37.000 --> 45:38.720\n It has hygienic macros.\n\n45:38.720 --> 45:39.640\n It has call CC.\n\n45:39.640 --> 45:44.640\n It has sort of a beautiful complete set of forms\n\n45:44.880 --> 45:49.440\n to make the land of calculus pleasant to use in practice.\n\n45:49.440 --> 45:54.120\n And JavaScript is, you know, kind of a multi paradigm\n\n45:54.120 --> 45:55.200\n or shambolic.\n\n45:55.200 --> 45:59.400\n Just in a small tangent, you mentioned Mark Andreessen.\n\n45:59.400 --> 46:03.400\n It sounds like, and Bill Joy, but staying on Mark,\n\n46:03.400 --> 46:06.520\n it sounds like he had an impact on you\n\n46:06.520 --> 46:09.120\n in that he sort of believed in what you were doing there.\n\n46:09.120 --> 46:11.920\n Can you talk about like what role Mark had in your life?\n\n46:11.920 --> 46:15.880\n Yeah, we would meet at the Peninsula Creamery\n\n46:15.880 --> 46:17.720\n in downtown Palo Alto.\n\n46:17.720 --> 46:19.960\n And Mark was just fresh out of, you know, grad school\n\n46:19.960 --> 46:22.720\n or whatever he was doing and he was big dude\n\n46:22.720 --> 46:25.280\n and he got fitter later.\n\n46:25.280 --> 46:28.800\n He had hair, he would order giant milkshakes and burgers\n\n46:28.800 --> 46:31.040\n and we would meet there and brainstorm about what to do.\n\n46:31.040 --> 46:34.280\n And it was very direct because we didn't have much time.\n\n46:34.280 --> 46:36.400\n The sort of, we didn't talk about it.\n\n46:36.400 --> 46:39.080\n The implication was Microsoft was coming after us.\n\n46:39.080 --> 46:41.760\n Mark was saying things boldly pre IPO\n\n46:41.760 --> 46:44.320\n like Netscape plus Java kills Windows, right?\n\n46:44.320 --> 46:46.840\n This is, make a browser programmable.\n\n46:46.840 --> 46:49.440\n It becomes the new runtime for programs.\n\n46:49.440 --> 46:52.000\n It's the meta OS or it's the replacement OS.\n\n46:52.000 --> 46:54.280\n But he still saw value in JavaScript.\n\n46:54.280 --> 46:56.000\n Yes, even though he was saying that\n\n46:56.000 --> 46:59.800\n and Java was the big name, hence the trademark license,\n\n46:59.800 --> 47:01.360\n he saw JavaScript as important.\n\n47:01.360 --> 47:03.720\n And he even thought, what if we got,\n\n47:03.720 --> 47:05.040\n I told this in other interviews, I can say it.\n\n47:05.040 --> 47:07.680\n He thought, what if we had my friend Kip Hickman\n\n47:07.680 --> 47:09.560\n who'd been at Netscape from the beginning\n\n47:09.560 --> 47:13.080\n and who was a kernel hacker at SGI when I joined,\n\n47:13.080 --> 47:14.920\n he'd started writing his own JVM\n\n47:14.920 --> 47:16.440\n before we consummated the Sun deal\n\n47:16.440 --> 47:17.960\n and got our hands on their code.\n\n47:17.960 --> 47:20.480\n And the Java compiler, Java C,\n\n47:20.480 --> 47:23.200\n which Arthur Van Hoff had written very nice code,\n\n47:23.200 --> 47:24.160\n was all written in Java.\n\n47:24.160 --> 47:26.480\n It was self hosted or so called bootstrap.\n\n47:26.480 --> 47:29.320\n And so we could use that as soon as Kip's Java VM\n\n47:29.320 --> 47:34.400\n could run the bytecode from the Sun JVM\n\n47:34.400 --> 47:37.520\n running the self hosted compiler to emit the bytecode.\n\n47:37.520 --> 47:39.400\n So once we could bootstrap into Kip's VM,\n\n47:39.400 --> 47:40.320\n we wouldn't need Sun.\n\n47:40.320 --> 47:44.400\n And Mark was like, well, maybe we can just ditch Sun.\n\n47:44.400 --> 47:47.360\n Well, if Kip's Java VM, or if you're a JavaScript VM,\n\n47:47.360 --> 47:48.240\n now we need graphics.\n\n47:48.240 --> 47:49.600\n So Mark was thinking far ahead\n\n47:49.600 --> 47:53.380\n because he knew you could do things with HTML and images,\n\n47:53.380 --> 47:54.920\n but at some point you really want.\n\n47:54.920 --> 47:57.600\n Like dynamic graphics or three dimensional?\n\n47:57.600 --> 47:59.920\n Even SGI had already started its downfall\n\n47:59.920 --> 48:02.960\n because the first floor VLSI team there\n\n48:02.960 --> 48:04.440\n had gone off to do 3D effects\n\n48:04.440 --> 48:05.360\n and all these other companies\n\n48:05.360 --> 48:07.520\n that made the graphics card on your PC, right?\n\n48:07.520 --> 48:09.360\n Doom was big and Quake.\n\n48:09.360 --> 48:10.680\n And so you were, we were all playing Quake.\n\n48:10.680 --> 48:12.880\n I was old, so I was terrible.\n\n48:12.880 --> 48:16.400\n But why not put that graphics capability on the web?\n\n48:16.400 --> 48:18.720\n And in fact, it finally happened at Mozilla\n\n48:18.720 --> 48:21.520\n with Firefox era with Vlad Vukicovic\n\n48:21.520 --> 48:24.420\n taking OpenGL ES and reflecting it as WebGL.\n\n48:24.420 --> 48:28.000\n But OpenGL ES is the mobile version of OpenGL,\n\n48:28.000 --> 48:30.320\n which is a standard based on SGI GL.\n\n48:30.320 --> 48:32.800\n So this whole lineage of graphics libraries\n\n48:32.800 --> 48:36.280\n or really graphics languages for what became the GPU.\n\n48:36.280 --> 48:37.320\n And Mark was thinking ahead.\n\n48:37.320 --> 48:38.560\n He's like, we need graphics too.\n\n48:38.560 --> 48:40.960\n And I thought, okay, I can try to get somebody I knew at SGI,\n\n48:40.960 --> 48:42.880\n but he's a grad student at MIT.\n\n48:42.880 --> 48:44.440\n He was studying under Barbara Liskov.\n\n48:44.440 --> 48:46.780\n He laughed when he heard about this later, Andrew Myers.\n\n48:46.780 --> 48:50.040\n He's at Cornell, long time, I think he's a full professor.\n\n48:50.040 --> 48:52.200\n And Mark said, great, we'll get him.\n\n48:52.200 --> 48:53.200\n I'm not sure he's gonna come.\n\n48:53.200 --> 48:55.320\n We'll throw money, we'll stock options.\n\n48:55.320 --> 48:56.160\n We never did it.\n\n48:56.160 --> 48:57.640\n And they did the Sun deal.\n\n48:57.640 --> 49:00.960\n So Kip Nobly put aside his own JVM\n\n49:00.960 --> 49:02.880\n and we used the Sun JVM.\n\n49:02.880 --> 49:04.000\n So that was an ambitious period.\n\n49:04.000 --> 49:06.640\n And Mark was very generative because he was pushing hard.\n\n49:06.640 --> 49:11.200\n He was ambitious and he wanted to have Netscape\n\n49:11.200 --> 49:13.680\n possibly be in control of the ball.\n\n49:13.680 --> 49:16.840\n Maybe you can speak to this dance\n\n49:16.840 --> 49:20.440\n of Netscape versus Internet Explorer.\n\n49:20.440 --> 49:25.440\n You've thrown some loving words towards Microsoft\n\n49:25.600 --> 49:26.720\n throughout this conversation,\n\n49:26.720 --> 49:29.080\n but that's a theme with, I mean, Steve Jobs\n\n49:29.080 --> 49:31.280\n has a similar sort of commentary.\n\n49:31.280 --> 49:34.520\n From a big sort of philosophical principle perspective,\n\n49:34.520 --> 49:36.600\n can you comment on like the approach\n\n49:36.600 --> 49:39.280\n that Microsoft has taken with Internet Explorer\n\n49:39.280 --> 49:42.120\n from IE1 to Edge today?\n\n49:42.120 --> 49:45.400\n Is there something that you see as valuable\n\n49:45.400 --> 49:48.420\n that they're doing in the occasional copying\n\n49:48.420 --> 49:49.600\n and that kind of stuff?\n\n49:49.600 --> 49:53.360\n Or is it, is the world worse off\n\n49:53.360 --> 49:55.240\n because Internet Explorer exists?\n\n49:55.240 --> 49:57.640\n So I'm gonna segment this into historical areas\n\n49:57.640 --> 49:59.560\n because I think Microsoft today with Satya\n\n49:59.560 --> 50:00.640\n is quite a different company\n\n50:00.640 --> 50:02.360\n and what they're doing with Edge is different.\n\n50:02.360 --> 50:06.160\n But back then, Gates, aggressive character,\n\n50:06.160 --> 50:09.680\n not really original in my view, not an originator.\n\n50:09.680 --> 50:11.280\n Steve Jobs famously said once,\n\n50:11.280 --> 50:12.440\n he doesn't have any taste\n\n50:12.440 --> 50:15.080\n and I don't mean this in a small way, he has no taste.\n\n50:15.080 --> 50:19.360\n You can see this, Apple at the time had beautiful typography\n\n50:19.360 --> 50:22.600\n and ligatures and kerning and the fonts looked great.\n\n50:22.600 --> 50:25.240\n And Windows had this sort of ugly system font\n\n50:25.240 --> 50:26.920\n that was carefully aligned with Pixel\n\n50:26.920 --> 50:28.640\n so it didn't get anything.\n\n50:28.640 --> 50:29.480\n What is it?\n\n50:29.480 --> 50:30.300\n I'm sorry to keep interrupting,\n\n50:30.300 --> 50:32.360\n but why was Internet Explorer winning\n\n50:32.360 --> 50:34.320\n throughout the history of these competitions?\n\n50:34.320 --> 50:35.240\n Distribution.\n\n50:35.240 --> 50:36.600\n Distribution matters more than anything.\n\n50:36.600 --> 50:39.840\n And this is why even now we're seeing\n\n50:39.840 --> 50:41.640\n in the browser wars Edge doing better\n\n50:41.640 --> 50:43.440\n because it's being foisted on people of Windows.\n\n50:43.440 --> 50:45.200\n We have Windows 10 boxes at home.\n\n50:45.200 --> 50:48.240\n We have some Windows 7 boxes or laptops we keep running to\n\n50:48.240 --> 50:50.840\n because we don't connect them to the internet generally.\n\n50:50.840 --> 50:55.840\n But once you have that operating system to hold,\n\n50:55.840 --> 50:57.800\n you can force Edge.\n\n50:57.800 --> 50:59.480\n And Apple did it with Safari too.\n\n50:59.480 --> 51:01.340\n It's not unique to Microsoft.\n\n51:01.340 --> 51:02.180\n That's sad.\n\n51:02.180 --> 51:03.680\n But distribution matters.\n\n51:03.680 --> 51:07.080\n And that's why I think IE was going to win.\n\n51:07.080 --> 51:09.560\n That's why everybody at Netscape felt we're doomed.\n\n51:09.560 --> 51:12.900\n This was something Michael Toy and Jamie Woodson were doomed.\n\n51:12.900 --> 51:14.720\n But for a while there we had a chance\n\n51:14.720 --> 51:16.040\n and we innovated in Netscape too.\n\n51:16.040 --> 51:18.860\n We did a big platform push, Java and JavaScript\n\n51:18.860 --> 51:23.860\n and plugins, more plugins and more HTML table features.\n\n51:23.860 --> 51:28.700\n And really started making a programmable stack\n\n51:28.700 --> 51:30.820\n out of what were pretty static web languages.\n\n51:30.820 --> 51:33.220\n And even in the beta releases of Netscape,\n\n51:33.220 --> 51:34.460\n two people were using JavaScript\n\n51:34.460 --> 51:36.620\n to build what you would call single page applications\n\n51:36.620 --> 51:37.620\n like Gmail.\n\n51:37.620 --> 51:40.380\n And they were using JavaScript locally to compute things\n\n51:40.380 --> 51:43.660\n and to call the server on a hidden frame in the background.\n\n51:43.660 --> 51:46.860\n So it was prefiguring a lot of what came later as AJAX\n\n51:46.860 --> 51:48.580\n or dynamic JavaScript, dynamic HTML.\n\n51:48.580 --> 51:49.740\n So people saw that, I mean.\n\n51:49.740 --> 51:50.920\n Even then they saw it, yeah.\n\n51:50.920 --> 51:52.900\n That's kind of, I don't know.\n\n51:52.900 --> 51:55.180\n But from my perspective, that seems quite brilliant.\n\n51:55.180 --> 51:56.580\n It seems like really innovative\n\n51:56.580 --> 51:59.220\n that you would have code run in the browser.\n\n51:59.220 --> 52:01.380\n It did impress me with something\n\n52:01.380 --> 52:04.020\n which I learned later about from Eric Von Hippel of MIT,\n\n52:04.020 --> 52:07.260\n which is user innovation networks, lead user effects.\n\n52:07.260 --> 52:09.200\n That throwing out JavaScript,\n\n52:09.200 --> 52:10.460\n even though we weren't doing open source,\n\n52:10.460 --> 52:12.320\n we were doing beta releases early\n\n52:12.320 --> 52:14.360\n and permissively with Netscape.\n\n52:14.360 --> 52:17.180\n Getting early developer feedback, absolutely critical.\n\n52:17.180 --> 52:18.020\n I loved it.\n\n52:18.020 --> 52:19.140\n I did some of that with SGI\n\n52:19.140 --> 52:20.260\n with some of the products I worked on,\n\n52:20.260 --> 52:21.860\n but it really came to the fore in Netscape.\n\n52:21.860 --> 52:23.780\n And that culminated in Mozilla\n\n52:23.780 --> 52:25.740\n where you're dealing with developers all the time\n\n52:25.740 --> 52:27.240\n and early adopters, lead users.\n\n52:27.240 --> 52:29.840\n But the lead users helped improve JavaScript,\n\n52:29.840 --> 52:31.580\n even in those last few betas\n\n52:31.580 --> 52:32.660\n where I could hardly change things.\n\n52:32.660 --> 52:34.580\n I was under pretty rigid change control.\n\n52:34.580 --> 52:36.260\n So we're talking about just a small collection\n\n52:36.260 --> 52:38.340\n of individuals that are just like upfront.\n\n52:38.340 --> 52:39.420\n A guy named Bill Dorch.\n\n52:39.420 --> 52:40.940\n You can find his work in the web archives,\n\n52:40.940 --> 52:41.960\n still from 1996.\n\n52:41.960 --> 52:43.300\n It's a single page application.\n\n52:43.300 --> 52:46.340\n It's an artist gallery of mountain art.\n\n52:46.340 --> 52:47.180\n He used JavaScript?\n\n52:47.180 --> 52:48.000\n It doesn't quite work.\n\n52:48.000 --> 52:48.840\n He uses JavaScript locally.\n\n52:48.840 --> 52:50.580\n He uses a local database.\n\n52:50.580 --> 52:52.180\n What you would think of now is JSON,\n\n52:52.180 --> 52:54.260\n but it's all pure JavaScript code,\n\n52:54.260 --> 52:55.820\n a bunch of objects being constructed.\n\n52:55.820 --> 52:57.460\n That's so cool.\n\n52:57.460 --> 53:02.460\n So how is, if you can do sort of a big sweeping progress\n\n53:02.620 --> 53:05.380\n of JavaScript, how has JavaScript changed over the years?\n\n53:05.380 --> 53:07.300\n Any of you from those early 10 days\n\n53:07.300 --> 53:09.460\n with a quick addition of garbage collection\n\n53:09.460 --> 53:11.140\n and fixes around security,\n\n53:11.140 --> 53:14.500\n how has this evolution that now it's taken over the world?\n\n53:14.500 --> 53:16.340\n In this, it's been a bumpy ride\n\n53:16.340 --> 53:19.900\n because the standards body got shut down after Microsoft,\n\n53:19.900 --> 53:22.580\n I think, took over the web and then felt punished\n\n53:22.580 --> 53:25.360\n by the USB Microsoft antitrust case.\n\n53:25.360 --> 53:27.380\n Can you speak to the standard body?\n\n53:27.380 --> 53:28.260\n That was a fun ride too\n\n53:28.260 --> 53:30.940\n because Netscape had taken the lead\n\n53:30.940 --> 53:34.340\n with the web and HTML innovations\n\n53:34.340 --> 53:36.900\n like frames and framesets tables.\n\n53:36.900 --> 53:39.220\n And the W3C was sort of off even then,\n\n53:39.220 --> 53:43.100\n sort of in SGML land heading toward XML, la la land.\n\n53:43.100 --> 53:44.340\n I'm gonna be a little harsh on it.\n\n53:44.340 --> 53:45.180\n What's SGML?\n\n53:45.180 --> 53:46.000\n I'm sorry.\n\n53:46.000 --> 53:48.900\n SGML was the precursor markup language to HTML.\n\n53:48.900 --> 53:52.740\n It was sort of the more extensible standards,\n\n53:52.740 --> 53:54.140\n generalized markup language.\n\n53:54.140 --> 53:54.980\n It was a...\n\n53:54.980 --> 53:55.820\n XML like...\n\n53:55.820 --> 53:58.540\n Pointy brackets, but it had all sorts of elaborate syntax\n\n53:58.540 --> 54:00.940\n for doing different semantics.\n\n54:00.940 --> 54:03.780\n And this is why I think TBL and others\n\n54:03.780 --> 54:08.320\n who wanted to do the semantic web then took XML forward,\n\n54:08.320 --> 54:10.400\n but they had this, or some of them anyway,\n\n54:10.400 --> 54:12.980\n had this strange idea they could replace the web with XML\n\n54:12.980 --> 54:15.720\n or that they would upgrade the web to be XML.\n\n54:15.720 --> 54:17.240\n And it couldn't be done.\n\n54:17.240 --> 54:19.500\n Worse is better had concrete meaning.\n\n54:19.500 --> 54:22.660\n The web was very forgiving of HTML,\n\n54:22.660 --> 54:25.180\n including sort of minor syntax errors\n\n54:25.180 --> 54:26.500\n that could be error corrected.\n\n54:26.500 --> 54:28.140\n Like error correction isn't generally done\n\n54:28.140 --> 54:29.980\n in programming languages because...\n\n54:29.980 --> 54:32.540\n That's another amazing thing about HTML is like,\n\n54:32.540 --> 54:35.140\n it's more like biology than programming.\n\n54:35.140 --> 54:35.980\n Exactly.\n\n54:35.980 --> 54:40.700\n And so XML was in its standard form super strict\n\n54:40.700 --> 54:43.220\n and could never have admitted the kind of users\n\n54:43.220 --> 54:44.420\n who were committing these errors.\n\n54:44.420 --> 54:46.500\n And the funniest part was Microsoft said,\n\n54:46.500 --> 54:47.620\n hey, we're doing XML,\n\n54:47.620 --> 54:49.540\n but the way they put it in Internet Explorer\n\n54:49.540 --> 54:51.500\n under the default media type,\n\n54:51.500 --> 54:53.940\n put it through the HTML error corrector.\n\n54:53.940 --> 54:54.940\n Oh, wow.\n\n54:54.940 --> 54:57.020\n So they kind of bastardized it to make it popular\n\n54:57.020 --> 54:58.580\n and usable and accessible.\n\n54:58.580 --> 55:03.580\n And so XML as a pure thing was never gonna take over.\n\n55:04.220 --> 55:07.140\n And what W3C was kind of not fully functional\n\n55:07.140 --> 55:09.700\n because Netscape wasn't cooperating with them.\n\n55:09.700 --> 55:11.100\n We thought about where to take JavaScript\n\n55:11.100 --> 55:12.660\n and we realized our standards,\n\n55:12.660 --> 55:17.140\n Guru Kargal realized there was a European standards body\n\n55:17.140 --> 55:18.800\n that had already given Microsoft fits\n\n55:18.800 --> 55:22.580\n by standardizing parts of the Windows 3.1 API,\n\n55:22.580 --> 55:24.020\n which European governments insisted on.\n\n55:24.020 --> 55:26.260\n They said, Microsoft, we can't use your operating system\n\n55:26.260 --> 55:27.580\n without some standards.\n\n55:27.580 --> 55:29.660\n And Microsoft said, here's our docs.\n\n55:29.660 --> 55:32.460\n And the government said, no, we need a European standard.\n\n55:32.460 --> 55:33.420\n So this body called\n\n55:33.420 --> 55:37.500\n the European Computer Manufacturers Association, ECMA,\n\n55:37.500 --> 55:38.620\n which eventually became global\n\n55:38.620 --> 55:40.980\n and became a proper noun instead of an acronym.\n\n55:40.980 --> 55:44.660\n Right, it's just one capital E now with a lowercase CMA.\n\n55:44.660 --> 55:47.580\n Right, and as one of the early Microsoft guys I met\n\n55:47.580 --> 55:50.260\n when we first convened a working group\n\n55:50.260 --> 55:51.420\n to talk about JavaScript said,\n\n55:51.420 --> 55:53.420\n it sounds like a skin disease.\n\n55:53.420 --> 55:56.140\n But it gave, I mean, maybe you'll speak to that,\n\n55:56.140 --> 55:58.980\n but it gave the name to JavaScript of ECMA script.\n\n55:58.980 --> 55:59.820\n That was the standard name\n\n55:59.820 --> 56:02.820\n because Java was a trademark of Suns.\n\n56:02.820 --> 56:03.720\n They were so aggressive,\n\n56:03.720 --> 56:05.840\n they were sending cease and desist letters\n\n56:05.840 --> 56:08.500\n to people whose middle European heritage\n\n56:08.500 --> 56:10.820\n meant their surname was Javanko\n\n56:10.820 --> 56:12.900\n and they called their website javanko.com\n\n56:12.900 --> 56:14.680\n and Sunwood sent them a letter saying,\n\n56:14.680 --> 56:16.820\n you're using J A V A at the start of your domain name,\n\n56:16.820 --> 56:18.940\n you must cease and desist.\n\n56:18.940 --> 56:22.020\n I love marketing more than anything else in this world.\n\n56:22.020 --> 56:27.020\n So ECMA script and now is popularly named as ES plus version.\n\n56:27.420 --> 56:29.900\n I would say people use JS more than anything.\n\n56:29.900 --> 56:31.140\n People still say JavaScript.\n\n56:31.140 --> 56:32.460\n JavaScript is in all the books.\n\n56:32.460 --> 56:33.740\n So I mean, when you're referring to it,\n\n56:33.740 --> 56:34.900\n it's usually JavaScript.\n\n56:34.900 --> 56:37.340\n And when you wanna refer to a version of JavaScript,\n\n56:37.340 --> 56:39.180\n you'll say ES6, ES5.\n\n56:39.180 --> 56:40.860\n Yes, or now they've gone to years,\n\n56:40.860 --> 56:41.840\n which is kind of confusing\n\n56:41.840 --> 56:46.840\n because it's an offset of 2009, ES6, ES 2016.\n\n56:50.740 --> 56:52.700\n Yeah, it doesn't match the years perfectly.\n\n56:52.700 --> 56:55.680\n Yeah, so what were the choices made\n\n56:55.680 --> 56:58.020\n and how did JavaScript evolve here?\n\n56:58.020 --> 57:01.100\n So we took this new standards body,\n\n57:01.100 --> 57:04.340\n which we thought sort of a proven record\n\n57:04.340 --> 57:05.420\n of standing up to Microsoft,\n\n57:05.420 --> 57:07.540\n but Microsoft sent a lot of people.\n\n57:07.540 --> 57:10.540\n They sent some people who were pretty good.\n\n57:10.540 --> 57:12.940\n And then when they realized that I was there\n\n57:12.940 --> 57:15.220\n and Netscape was not gonna just bend over\n\n57:15.220 --> 57:16.380\n and do whatever they wanted,\n\n57:16.380 --> 57:17.220\n they sent somebody really good.\n\n57:17.220 --> 57:18.060\n And he was a smart guy.\n\n57:18.060 --> 57:21.000\n He did a lot of the work on the first draft of the spec.\n\n57:21.000 --> 57:22.780\n Sean Katzenberger, he's left Microsoft.\n\n57:22.780 --> 57:25.280\n He even did what I sort of did.\n\n57:25.280 --> 57:28.000\n He told his bosses, stop bugging me to do other things.\n\n57:28.000 --> 57:28.960\n I'm focused on this.\n\n57:28.960 --> 57:30.580\n Cause it took a lot of focused work\n\n57:30.580 --> 57:31.940\n to create the first draft of the spec.\n\n57:31.940 --> 57:33.560\n And I was still holding,\n\n57:33.560 --> 57:34.900\n I was spending almost all the plates.\n\n57:34.900 --> 57:37.220\n I had like part time help in certain areas.\n\n57:37.220 --> 57:38.740\n And on the front end integrations,\n\n57:38.740 --> 57:40.080\n I had the front end guys.\n\n57:40.080 --> 57:42.620\n But I couldn't take as much time as Sean was\n\n57:42.620 --> 57:43.680\n to write the draft spec,\n\n57:43.680 --> 57:44.660\n but I had to participate\n\n57:44.660 --> 57:46.880\n because I was essentially helping write down\n\n57:46.880 --> 57:48.020\n what the language did\n\n57:48.020 --> 57:50.180\n and in areas where we didn't like what it did\n\n57:50.180 --> 57:51.620\n and Microsoft didn't agree,\n\n57:51.620 --> 57:54.580\n we sometimes got away with slight changes.\n\n57:54.580 --> 57:55.800\n And that's the story of standards.\n\n57:55.800 --> 57:58.020\n You have different implementations\n\n57:58.020 --> 57:59.840\n and depending on their market power,\n\n57:59.840 --> 58:01.840\n they interoperate where you have agreement\n\n58:01.840 --> 58:02.780\n and where they don't,\n\n58:02.780 --> 58:05.900\n the dominant one usually sets the de facto standard.\n\n58:05.900 --> 58:07.500\n And then you should probably reflect that\n\n58:07.500 --> 58:09.340\n into the de jure standard.\n\n58:09.340 --> 58:11.060\n And this happened with JavaScript.\n\n58:11.060 --> 58:14.120\n Over time, as Netscape went down and Microsoft went up,\n\n58:14.120 --> 58:18.180\n we did the first edition of the standard codified in 1997\n\n58:18.180 --> 58:22.140\n in France, we had a trip to Nice, which was very memorable.\n\n58:22.140 --> 58:24.540\n For any interesting reason or just because it's Nice?\n\n58:24.540 --> 58:28.980\n And ECMA's European and IBM and others were there.\n\n58:28.980 --> 58:31.340\n Mike Kalashaw, an IBM fellow was a British.\n\n58:31.340 --> 58:35.260\n And the guy who ran ECMA at the time, Jan van der Bell,\n\n58:35.260 --> 58:39.060\n was quite a raconteur and a very fun guy.\n\n58:39.060 --> 58:41.220\n And he had us out for, you know, the great,\n\n58:41.220 --> 58:43.480\n you know, Fui de mer, the bouillabaisse and the...\n\n58:43.480 --> 58:46.140\n Was the standardization process beautiful or painful\n\n58:46.140 --> 58:48.460\n that those early days, you as a designer of the language?\n\n58:48.460 --> 58:50.140\n It was painful because it was rushed.\n\n58:50.140 --> 58:52.400\n Now, Guy Steele was contributed by Sun.\n\n58:52.400 --> 58:53.620\n So even more than Sean,\n\n58:53.620 --> 58:55.960\n you had this giant brain Guy Steele helping,\n\n58:55.960 --> 58:57.220\n bringing some of that scheme magic.\n\n58:57.220 --> 58:59.460\n And he even brought Richard Gabriel for funding.\n\n58:59.460 --> 59:02.900\n Richard wrote the fourth clause of the ECMA standard,\n\n59:02.900 --> 59:05.300\n which was kind of an intro to what JavaScript's all about.\n\n59:05.300 --> 59:07.260\n So we had some really good people\n\n59:07.260 --> 59:09.140\n and we didn't fight too much.\n\n59:09.140 --> 59:11.480\n There was some tension where I was fixing bugs\n\n59:11.480 --> 59:13.860\n and I was late to a meeting and Sean Katzenberger,\n\n59:13.860 --> 59:15.020\n Microsoft, was actually mad.\n\n59:15.020 --> 59:15.840\n Like, where is he?\n\n59:15.840 --> 59:16.680\n We need him.\n\n59:16.680 --> 59:18.660\n And when I got there,\n\n59:18.660 --> 59:21.940\n I saw that only he saw this sort of off by one bug\n\n59:21.940 --> 59:22.960\n in somewhere in the spec.\n\n59:22.960 --> 59:24.020\n And then I saw it too.\n\n59:24.020 --> 59:25.300\n And I said, there's a fence post bug there.\n\n59:25.300 --> 59:27.020\n And then we kind of locked eyes\n\n59:27.020 --> 59:28.480\n and we realized we were on the same page.\n\n59:28.480 --> 59:30.300\n And we kind of, he wasn't mad anymore.\n\n59:30.300 --> 59:33.020\n What were the features that are being struggled over\n\n59:33.020 --> 59:35.000\n and debated and thought about?\n\n59:35.000 --> 59:36.480\n It was mainly writing down what worked\n\n59:36.480 --> 59:38.420\n and what we thought should work in the edge cases\n\n59:38.420 --> 59:41.540\n that didn't interoperate or that seemed wrong.\n\n59:41.540 --> 59:43.080\n But we were already laying the groundwork\n\n59:43.080 --> 59:46.220\n for the future additions that I was already implementing.\n\n59:46.220 --> 59:48.120\n I was still trying to lead the standard\n\n59:48.120 --> 59:50.100\n by using the dominant market power\n\n59:50.100 --> 59:52.500\n to write the code that actually shipped.\n\n59:52.500 --> 59:54.740\n So the de facto standard would lead the de jure standard.\n\n59:54.740 --> 59:58.220\n And I was putting in the missing function forms\n\n59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.520\n that I didn't have time for in the 10 days.\n\n1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:03.500\n So this is the engineering mindset versus the theoretician.\n\n1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:05.120\n So you didn't want to create the perfect language,\n\n1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:06.940\n but one that was the popular and shipped\n\n1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:07.780\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:00:07.780 --> 1:00:08.620\n And you could say there was,\n\n1:00:08.620 --> 1:00:09.940\n I was standing on the shoulders of giants.\n\n1:00:09.940 --> 1:00:11.220\n So there was a staged process\n\n1:00:11.220 --> 1:00:12.820\n where I had to hold back things\n\n1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:15.900\n that were well designed by others in other languages\n\n1:00:15.900 --> 1:00:17.260\n and I could imitate,\n\n1:00:17.260 --> 1:00:18.540\n but I couldn't do them all in the 10 days.\n\n1:00:18.540 --> 1:00:22.820\n So they came in 1996 and 97,\n\n1:00:22.820 --> 1:00:25.140\n and they came into the third edition of the standard,\n\n1:00:25.140 --> 1:00:27.680\n which was final finalized in 1999.\n\n1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:28.520\n But at that point,\n\n1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:31.220\n Netscape had been sold to AOL\n\n1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.140\n which was a decent exit considering\n\n1:00:33.140 --> 1:00:37.380\n and had previously been mercilessly crushed.\n\n1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:40.700\n Netscape was selling the browser along with server software\n\n1:00:40.700 --> 1:00:42.740\n that it had acquired after its IPO\n\n1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.560\n and Microsoft was just underpricing it.\n\n1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:47.500\n So there was no way to compete with that.\n\n1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:51.420\n Microsoft was also making Internet Explorer\n\n1:00:51.420 --> 1:00:53.140\n the default browser in Windows,\n\n1:00:53.140 --> 1:00:55.580\n which is called tying and antitrust law.\n\n1:00:55.580 --> 1:00:57.140\n And they were doing even more brutal things.\n\n1:00:57.140 --> 1:00:59.260\n There was a famous investor.\n\n1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:00.340\n He did very well on Google.\n\n1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:01.780\n So he's a billionaire, Ramshree Ram,\n\n1:01:01.780 --> 1:01:04.700\n and he was sales guy or head of sales at Netscape.\n\n1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:07.920\n And he got off the phone looking ashen faced\n\n1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:09.620\n after a compact called and said,\n\n1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:12.060\n Microsoft just told us they're gonna pull\n\n1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:13.860\n our Windows license if we ship Netscape\n\n1:01:13.860 --> 1:01:15.100\n as the default browser.\n\n1:01:15.100 --> 1:01:15.940\n Wow.\n\n1:01:15.940 --> 1:01:17.460\n So there is some bullying going on.\n\n1:01:17.460 --> 1:01:19.720\n It was totally immaterial in the antitrust case.\n\n1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:23.060\n But JavaScript escaped into the standard setting\n\n1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:24.900\n where there was fairly good cooperation.\n\n1:01:24.900 --> 1:01:26.860\n Microsoft had a really good guy on it\n\n1:01:26.860 --> 1:01:29.420\n and Guy Steele was there for a time\n\n1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:30.900\n and there was some good work.\n\n1:01:30.900 --> 1:01:33.460\n But after the antitrust case\n\n1:01:33.460 --> 1:01:37.500\n and Netscape kind of dissolving into AOL\n\n1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:38.940\n and not really going anywhere quickly,\n\n1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:40.960\n Mozilla took years to really bring up,\n\n1:01:42.380 --> 1:01:43.400\n the standard froze.\n\n1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:46.300\n And by 2003, even though they'd been sort of noodling around\n\n1:01:46.300 --> 1:01:48.900\n with advanced versions, JavaScript 2,\n\n1:01:48.900 --> 1:01:50.300\n I'd given the keys to the kingdom\n\n1:01:50.300 --> 1:01:53.060\n to another MIT grad, Baltimore Horwatt.\n\n1:01:53.060 --> 1:01:54.860\n Very big brain and still at Google, I think.\n\n1:01:54.860 --> 1:01:56.700\n He won the Putnam in 86\n\n1:01:56.700 --> 1:01:58.380\n and he's very mathematical.\n\n1:01:58.380 --> 1:01:59.640\n Legit.\n\n1:01:59.640 --> 1:02:02.980\n He designed this successor language, JavaScript 2,\n\n1:02:02.980 --> 1:02:06.620\n but it only showed up in mutated form\n\n1:02:06.620 --> 1:02:09.560\n in Microsoft's ASP.NET server side\n\n1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:11.100\n and it didn't last there.\n\n1:02:11.100 --> 1:02:12.340\n And it showed up in Flash\n\n1:02:12.340 --> 1:02:14.220\n and that's what became ActionScript 3.\n\n1:02:14.220 --> 1:02:16.860\n Ah, ActionScript, interesting.\n\n1:02:16.860 --> 1:02:18.740\n And then Flash of course declined.\n\n1:02:18.740 --> 1:02:21.300\n And so how did we arrive at ES6\n\n1:02:21.300 --> 1:02:24.120\n where it's like there's so many,\n\n1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:27.220\n where everyone, okay, there's this history of JavaScript\n\n1:02:27.220 --> 1:02:29.220\n that people were, it was just like cool\n\n1:02:29.220 --> 1:02:32.540\n when you're like having beers to talk crap about JavaScript.\n\n1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:33.900\n Everyone loves to hate,\n\n1:02:33.900 --> 1:02:36.460\n like people who are married say, ah, marriage sucks,\n\n1:02:36.460 --> 1:02:38.900\n is they just wanna get, let off some steam\n\n1:02:38.900 --> 1:02:40.900\n even though everyone uses the language.\n\n1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:45.900\n But ES6, it's become this like reputable,\n\n1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:49.180\n like it fixed major pain points, I think.\n\n1:02:49.180 --> 1:02:50.420\n It added things to the language\n\n1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:53.580\n and added something that was already ES5 strict mode,\n\n1:02:53.580 --> 1:02:57.260\n but made it implicit in class bodies and module bodies.\n\n1:02:57.260 --> 1:02:58.500\n It was a big jump,\n\n1:02:58.500 --> 1:03:01.300\n but it accumulated some of the ES4 designs\n\n1:03:01.300 --> 1:03:03.640\n that we'd done with Adobe\n\n1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:07.660\n for what we hoped would be the fourth edition of ECMAScript\n\n1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:10.740\n that were supposed to fold in some of these old JavaScript 2\n\n1:03:10.740 --> 1:03:13.060\n ideas that had come into ActionScript 3.\n\n1:03:13.060 --> 1:03:15.220\n So you look at the family tree and you see these forks\n\n1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:20.220\n and the main ones are the ones that go into Adobe Flash\n\n1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:21.900\n acquired from Macromedia\n\n1:03:21.900 --> 1:03:23.580\n and the one that went into the service side\n\n1:03:23.580 --> 1:03:26.040\n of Microsoft's stack, which kind of died.\n\n1:03:27.100 --> 1:03:28.900\n And then trying to bring them back into the standard\n\n1:03:28.900 --> 1:03:32.300\n and not quite succeeding, ES4 was mothballed,\n\n1:03:32.300 --> 1:03:35.700\n but all the good parts that everyone liked made it into ES6.\n\n1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:37.060\n And so that was a success.\n\n1:03:37.060 --> 1:03:38.380\n And I said earlier, I had the wrong year,\n\n1:03:38.380 --> 1:03:40.380\n I think it's 2015, so it's off by.\n\n1:03:40.380 --> 1:03:42.420\n Four, ES6.\n\n1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:44.300\n Yeah, it was finalized in 2015.\n\n1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:45.620\n It took a little longer than we hoped,\n\n1:03:45.620 --> 1:03:48.580\n but because ES5 was 2009\n\n1:03:48.580 --> 1:03:51.580\n and that was a smaller increment from ES3.\n\n1:03:51.580 --> 1:03:53.500\n We skipped four again, we mothballed it.\n\n1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:56.620\n And we had a split in the committee where some people said,\n\n1:03:56.620 --> 1:03:59.540\n ES4 is too big, we're gonna work on incremental improvements,\n\n1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:02.580\n no new syntax in particular, they promised.\n\n1:04:02.580 --> 1:04:06.300\n Not quite true, but they added a bunch of interesting APIs,\n\n1:04:06.300 --> 1:04:09.880\n Alan Wiersbrock, my coauthor of the Hobble paper.\n\n1:04:09.880 --> 1:04:11.140\n And he was at Microsoft at the time.\n\n1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:12.300\n I ended up hiring with Mozilla.\n\n1:04:12.300 --> 1:04:15.220\n He wanted to get to Mozilla and keep doing\n\n1:04:16.620 --> 1:04:19.660\n his sort of editor job of the JavaScript standard,\n\n1:04:19.660 --> 1:04:21.300\n ECMAScript.\n\n1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:25.660\n And when we got ES6 done, it was a little late, 2015,\n\n1:04:25.660 --> 1:04:27.180\n and we switched to year numbers.\n\n1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.100\n So people still call it ES6, I call it ES6.\n\n1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:33.100\n But if you remember, off by nine plus 2000.\n\n1:04:33.100 --> 1:04:35.780\n Yeah, I mean, ES6 is such a big job.\n\n1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:38.300\n I mean, like you said, there's a third that connects all of it,\n\n1:04:38.300 --> 1:04:41.100\n but ES6 is when it became this language\n\n1:04:41.100 --> 1:04:45.180\n that almost feels ready to take over the world completely.\n\n1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:46.660\n More programming and the large features,\n\n1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:49.380\n more features you need for larger teams.\n\n1:04:49.380 --> 1:04:50.300\n Software engineering.\n\n1:04:50.300 --> 1:04:52.220\n Microsoft did something smart, too.\n\n1:04:52.220 --> 1:04:56.220\n Anders and company, Luke Hoban, who's left Microsoft,\n\n1:04:56.220 --> 1:04:57.800\n also did TypeScript.\n\n1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:00.400\n And they realized something, I think,\n\n1:05:00.400 --> 1:05:02.760\n that Gilad Barak has also popularized,\n\n1:05:02.760 --> 1:05:05.740\n and he was involved in Dart at Google.\n\n1:05:05.740 --> 1:05:08.860\n If you, don't worry about soundness in the type system.\n\n1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:10.920\n You don't try to enforce the type checks\n\n1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:11.860\n at runtime in particular.\n\n1:05:11.860 --> 1:05:13.460\n Just use it as sort of a warning system,\n\n1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:15.020\n a tool time type system.\n\n1:05:15.020 --> 1:05:17.660\n You can still have a lot of value for developers,\n\n1:05:17.660 --> 1:05:19.260\n especially in large projects.\n\n1:05:19.260 --> 1:05:21.260\n So TypeScript's been a roaring success for Microsoft.\n\n1:05:21.260 --> 1:05:24.100\n What do you think about TypeScript?\n\n1:05:24.100 --> 1:05:27.380\n Is it adding confusion, or is it ultimately beneficial?\n\n1:05:27.380 --> 1:05:28.220\n I think it's beneficial.\n\n1:05:28.220 --> 1:05:30.920\n Now, it's technically a superset of JavaScript,\n\n1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.380\n so of course I love it, right?\n\n1:05:33.380 --> 1:05:35.540\n The shortest JavaScript program\n\n1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:36.660\n is still a TypeScript program.\n\n1:05:36.660 --> 1:05:38.540\n Any JavaScript program is a TypeScript program,\n\n1:05:38.540 --> 1:05:39.380\n which is brilliant,\n\n1:05:39.380 --> 1:05:40.860\n because then you can start incrementally adding\n\n1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:43.020\n type annotations, getting warnings,\n\n1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:44.420\n learning how to use them.\n\n1:05:44.420 --> 1:05:47.180\n Microsoft's had to kind of look around corners\n\n1:05:47.180 --> 1:05:50.780\n at the standards body and guess how their version of modules\n\n1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.500\n or decorators should work.\n\n1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:55.380\n And the standards body then may change things a bit.\n\n1:05:55.380 --> 1:05:57.620\n So I think they're obligated with TypeScript\n\n1:05:57.620 --> 1:05:59.340\n either to carry their own version\n\n1:05:59.340 --> 1:06:01.680\n or to bring it back with incompatible changes\n\n1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:03.100\n towards the standard over time.\n\n1:06:03.100 --> 1:06:05.420\n And I think they've played generally fair there.\n\n1:06:05.420 --> 1:06:06.460\n There's some sentiment that,\n\n1:06:06.460 --> 1:06:07.980\n why don't they standardize TypeScript?\n\n1:06:07.980 --> 1:06:09.920\n Well, they've been clear they don't want to.\n\n1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:11.880\n They have a proprietary investment, it's valuable.\n\n1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:13.420\n They have control of the ball.\n\n1:06:13.420 --> 1:06:15.820\n And in some ways, you can say the same thing\n\n1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:18.100\n to any of the other big companies in the standards body.\n\n1:06:18.100 --> 1:06:20.580\n Why doesn't Google standardize its stuff?\n\n1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:22.260\n So you think it'll continue being\n\n1:06:22.260 --> 1:06:24.620\n like a kind of dance partner to JavaScript,\n\n1:06:24.620 --> 1:06:25.860\n to the base JavaScript?\n\n1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:27.620\n There's a hope that at some point,\n\n1:06:27.620 --> 1:06:29.740\n if they keep reconverging it and the standard\n\n1:06:29.740 --> 1:06:32.020\n doesn't break them and goes in a good direction,\n\n1:06:32.020 --> 1:06:34.780\n we will get at least the annotation syntax\n\n1:06:34.780 --> 1:06:37.020\n and some semantics around them.\n\n1:06:37.020 --> 1:06:39.020\n Because when you're talking about type annotations,\n\n1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:42.340\n they're generally on parameters and return values\n\n1:06:42.340 --> 1:06:43.940\n and variable declarations.\n\n1:06:43.940 --> 1:06:45.540\n They're cast operators.\n\n1:06:45.540 --> 1:06:47.260\n You want that syntax to be reserved\n\n1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:49.980\n and you want it to work the same in all engines.\n\n1:06:49.980 --> 1:06:51.540\n And this is where ideas like Gilad's\n\n1:06:51.540 --> 1:06:54.240\n pluggable type systems might be good,\n\n1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:55.820\n though then you could create the same problem\n\n1:06:55.820 --> 1:06:56.960\n you have with Lisp and Scheme,\n\n1:06:56.960 --> 1:06:58.540\n where there's a bunch of macro libraries\n\n1:06:58.540 --> 1:07:01.700\n and they don't agree and you have conflicts between them.\n\n1:07:01.700 --> 1:07:04.940\n But pluggable type systems could be one way to standardize.\n\n1:07:04.940 --> 1:07:07.060\n What do you think about the giant ecosystem\n\n1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:09.820\n of frameworks in JavaScript?\n\n1:07:09.820 --> 1:07:12.860\n It feels like, because, I mean,\n\n1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:16.060\n this is a side effect of how many people use JavaScript,\n\n1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:19.220\n a lot of entrepreneurial spirit\n\n1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:22.300\n create their own JavaScript frameworks\n\n1:07:22.300 --> 1:07:27.260\n and they're actually awesome in all different ways.\n\n1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:31.220\n And this is an interesting question\n\n1:07:31.220 --> 1:07:33.180\n about almost like philosophically\n\n1:07:33.180 --> 1:07:35.260\n about biological system and evolution,\n\n1:07:35.260 --> 1:07:36.140\n all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:07:36.140 --> 1:07:38.600\n Do you see that as good or should it like,\n\n1:07:38.600 --> 1:07:40.380\n should some of them die out quicker?\n\n1:07:40.380 --> 1:07:44.480\n I think maybe they should, now jQuery was a very clever\n\n1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:45.980\n thing, John Resig made this library\n\n1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:47.600\n that was sort of query and do\n\n1:07:47.600 --> 1:07:49.980\n and blended sort of CSS selector syntax\n\n1:07:49.980 --> 1:07:53.020\n with JavaScript sort of object graph or DOM querying\n\n1:07:53.020 --> 1:07:54.940\n and made it very easy for people to do things\n\n1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:57.660\n almost like they were learning jQuery as its own language,\n\n1:07:57.660 --> 1:07:58.980\n domain specific language.\n\n1:07:58.980 --> 1:08:03.220\n And that I think reflected in part the difficulty\n\n1:08:03.220 --> 1:08:04.960\n of using the document object model,\n\n1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:07.020\n these APIs that were originally designed in the 90s\n\n1:08:07.020 --> 1:08:08.460\n for Java as well as JavaScript.\n\n1:08:08.460 --> 1:08:11.740\n They're very object oriented or even procedural.\n\n1:08:11.740 --> 1:08:13.360\n They're very kind of verbose.\n\n1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:15.420\n And it took like a constructor call\n\n1:08:15.420 --> 1:08:17.820\n and three different, you know, hokey pokey dances\n\n1:08:17.820 --> 1:08:20.500\n to do something where as in jQuery, it's just one line.\n\n1:08:20.500 --> 1:08:24.500\n Right, so that fed back finally into the standards.\n\n1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:25.940\n It didn't mean we standardized jQuery.\n\n1:08:25.940 --> 1:08:27.140\n It wasn't quite that concise,\n\n1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:29.660\n but you find now with the modern standards\n\n1:08:29.660 --> 1:08:34.660\n that we were working on in the HTML5 sort of effort\n\n1:08:34.780 --> 1:08:37.100\n that things became simpler, the fetch API\n\n1:08:37.100 --> 1:08:40.140\n and the query selector API, document.querySelector.\n\n1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:42.540\n A lot of things can be done now in raw JavaScript\n\n1:08:42.540 --> 1:08:46.660\n that you would make more concise and terse in jQuery,\n\n1:08:46.660 --> 1:08:47.980\n but it's not bad.\n\n1:08:47.980 --> 1:08:48.820\n It's pretty good.\n\n1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:51.100\n Whereas in the old DOM of 15 years ago,\n\n1:08:51.100 --> 1:08:51.940\n it was just too verbose.\n\n1:08:51.940 --> 1:08:55.560\n So maybe the frameworks were born kind of\n\n1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:59.020\n because JavaScript lacks some of the features of jQuery.\n\n1:08:59.020 --> 1:09:02.700\n And so like now that JavaScript is swallowing\n\n1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:05.220\n what jQuery was, then the frameworks will,\n\n1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:07.840\n only the ones that truly add value will stick around\n\n1:09:07.840 --> 1:09:08.980\n and the other ones will die out.\n\n1:09:08.980 --> 1:09:10.700\n And that highlights this also this division\n\n1:09:10.700 --> 1:09:12.300\n between the core language JavaScript,\n\n1:09:12.300 --> 1:09:13.580\n which can show up in other places\n\n1:09:13.580 --> 1:09:15.680\n like Node.js on the server side\n\n1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:17.660\n and the browser specific APIs\n\n1:09:17.660 --> 1:09:19.720\n or the document object model APIs,\n\n1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:21.580\n which are even managed by the W3C,\n\n1:09:21.580 --> 1:09:24.460\n the standards body that was off in XML La La Land\n\n1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:26.940\n when we were doing real JavaScript standards in ECMA.\n\n1:09:26.940 --> 1:09:30.260\n And you have this division of labor,\n\n1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:33.260\n division of responsibility and division of style\n\n1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:37.260\n and sort of aesthetics and also speed.\n\n1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:39.620\n So the document object model really stagnated\n\n1:09:39.620 --> 1:09:43.580\n after Microsoft kind of deinvested in the web.\n\n1:09:43.580 --> 1:09:45.860\n And Microsoft did something in their haste\n\n1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:46.900\n in the spirit of Netscape,\n\n1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:49.780\n doing things quickly and getting on first called DHTML.\n\n1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:51.340\n And some of their innovations\n\n1:09:51.340 --> 1:09:53.700\n that were like an alternative document object model\n\n1:09:53.700 --> 1:09:56.860\n didn't really get standardized until HTML5\n\n1:09:56.860 --> 1:10:00.020\n when we pragmatists at Opera at the time,\n\n1:10:00.020 --> 1:10:01.720\n Ian Hickson who went to Google,\n\n1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:05.100\n Apple and Mozilla said let's,\n\n1:10:05.100 --> 1:10:08.700\n XML is not gonna replace HTML, HTML4 is too old.\n\n1:10:08.700 --> 1:10:12.140\n Let's standardize HTML5 based on all this good stuff\n\n1:10:12.140 --> 1:10:14.900\n including that DHTML variant dynamic HTML5.\n\n1:10:14.900 --> 1:10:18.140\n HTML5, it feels like to me, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:10:18.140 --> 1:10:21.140\n like a beautiful piece of design work.\n\n1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:24.860\n It was, it's not often with web stuff,\n\n1:10:24.860 --> 1:10:27.320\n you have this breath of just like,\n\n1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:31.740\n oh, whoever did this is, it just feels good.\n\n1:10:31.740 --> 1:10:33.660\n Is that, what are your thoughts about HTML?\n\n1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:35.860\n Is the, am I being too romantic?\n\n1:10:35.860 --> 1:10:36.780\n A little bit, a little bit.\n\n1:10:36.780 --> 1:10:38.660\n Are there flaws, fundamental flaws to it\n\n1:10:38.660 --> 1:10:40.180\n that I'm just not aware of?\n\n1:10:40.180 --> 1:10:42.540\n My old friend Hixie did a great job.\n\n1:10:42.540 --> 1:10:45.660\n He was another renegade physics student.\n\n1:10:45.660 --> 1:10:47.980\n And he was basically a QA guy at Opera\n\n1:10:47.980 --> 1:10:52.500\n but he obviously trained physics student\n\n1:10:52.500 --> 1:10:54.620\n and someone who could write British\n\n1:10:54.620 --> 1:10:57.820\n or he developed test suites\n\n1:10:57.820 --> 1:11:00.920\n and he started thinking about them more axiomatically.\n\n1:11:00.920 --> 1:11:02.520\n Now this is, this can be good\n\n1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:03.980\n because you can sort of systematize\n\n1:11:03.980 --> 1:11:06.020\n in a way that makes a better HTML\n\n1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:08.100\n or you can get caught in the pragmatism of saying,\n\n1:11:08.100 --> 1:11:09.820\n well, we have to handle all of these edge cases\n\n1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:12.580\n so we're just gonna have sort of a test matrix.\n\n1:11:12.580 --> 1:11:13.980\n And if the matrix is large,\n\n1:11:13.980 --> 1:11:15.860\n it will not be beautiful by many people's lights.\n\n1:11:15.860 --> 1:11:19.340\n Everyone likes to minimize along their preferred dimensions,\n\n1:11:19.340 --> 1:11:21.660\n the seven special forms and scheme or whatever.\n\n1:11:21.660 --> 1:11:26.660\n But reality is HTML needs to be big.\n\n1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:30.400\n It's kind of shambolic, it's a creative multi paradigm.\n\n1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:34.380\n And Hixie did a good job, I would say, with a bunch of it.\n\n1:11:34.380 --> 1:11:36.620\n Other people came in in the spirit of Ian Hickson\n\n1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:40.260\n to do HTML5 work and they've carried on that effort.\n\n1:11:40.260 --> 1:11:42.820\n And so it's a mix of pragmatism,\n\n1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:46.280\n de facto standards from the past being sort of combined\n\n1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:47.580\n or written down for the first time\n\n1:11:47.580 --> 1:11:50.300\n and then rethought in a way that has a simpler syntax,\n\n1:11:50.300 --> 1:11:54.420\n like the fetch API instead of XML HTTP request.\n\n1:11:54.420 --> 1:11:56.540\n This video too as well, it ultimately,\n\n1:11:56.540 --> 1:11:58.100\n it feels like maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:11:58.100 --> 1:12:01.180\n it feels like it was the nail in the coffin of Flash.\n\n1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.020\n Steve Jobs saying no Flash on the iPhone,\n\n1:12:03.020 --> 1:12:05.460\n in my opinion, was the actual sting through the heart.\n\n1:12:05.460 --> 1:12:09.140\n But, well, I'm not sure what trope you wanna use.\n\n1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:12.060\n Flash was a zombie until just this year, right?\n\n1:12:12.060 --> 1:12:13.300\n Or last year, I think last year\n\n1:12:13.300 --> 1:12:15.260\n was the end of Flash in main browsers.\n\n1:12:16.380 --> 1:12:18.280\n But Jobs really did the death blow.\n\n1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:23.020\n And yeah, you're right, we had to make HTML5 competitive.\n\n1:12:23.020 --> 1:12:23.900\n I still don't think we got\n\n1:12:23.900 --> 1:12:26.780\n that beautiful timeline animation.\n\n1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:28.620\n The timeline thing, so you like the time.\n\n1:12:28.620 --> 1:12:31.180\n I mean, me from, I used to animate\n\n1:12:31.180 --> 1:12:32.780\n all kinds of stuff inside Flash,\n\n1:12:32.780 --> 1:12:34.940\n plus there's a programming element.\n\n1:12:34.940 --> 1:12:38.440\n It was a little bit, I don't know if you can comment on that,\n\n1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:40.780\n but to me, it was a little bit like go to statement,\n\n1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:44.900\n like in a sense that it was a little bit too chaotic.\n\n1:12:44.900 --> 1:12:48.380\n Like it didn't, that OCD part of me as a programmer\n\n1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:50.180\n wasn't satisfied by Flash.\n\n1:12:50.180 --> 1:12:52.760\n It feels like there was bugs that were introduced\n\n1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:55.340\n through the animation process that I couldn't debug easily.\n\n1:12:55.340 --> 1:12:56.620\n Yes, I heard that too.\n\n1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:57.460\n I didn't use it,\n\n1:12:57.460 --> 1:12:59.820\n so I'm doing the grass is greener thing here.\n\n1:12:59.820 --> 1:13:02.100\n The thing I liked about the animation model\n\n1:13:02.100 --> 1:13:03.900\n was that it was this immutable function of time.\n\n1:13:03.900 --> 1:13:06.220\n So you could time warp and you could,\n\n1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:08.320\n if you dodged these bugs or worked carefully,\n\n1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:09.900\n you could really make it sing in ways\n\n1:13:09.900 --> 1:13:11.700\n that I think still a little challenging\n\n1:13:11.700 --> 1:13:14.620\n with the web animation standards.\n\n1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:18.140\n But, or just using raw canvas and WebGL.\n\n1:13:18.140 --> 1:13:20.740\n But there's so many tools now that maybe it doesn't matter.\n\n1:13:20.740 --> 1:13:23.980\n And yet we had to do video,\n\n1:13:23.980 --> 1:13:27.820\n we had to do WebGL and then evolve it.\n\n1:13:27.820 --> 1:13:29.160\n We had to do web audio.\n\n1:13:30.060 --> 1:13:34.140\n But once we did all these things that helped Flash die,\n\n1:13:34.140 --> 1:13:35.700\n thanks to Steve Gubbs,\n\n1:13:35.700 --> 1:13:39.580\n we had something that people didn't realize.\n\n1:13:39.580 --> 1:13:41.180\n We had that vision that Market Vision had,\n\n1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:46.180\n this graphics capable to the metal portable runtime.\n\n1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.360\n And we at Mozilla realized this\n\n1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:52.420\n and we saw JavaScript was something\n\n1:13:52.420 --> 1:13:53.340\n that you could compile to.\n\n1:13:53.340 --> 1:13:55.620\n Adobe had somebody in the Adobe Labs doing this too.\n\n1:13:55.620 --> 1:13:57.220\n He had a project called Alchemy.\n\n1:13:57.220 --> 1:13:58.920\n We had somebody who's now Google,\n\n1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:03.260\n Alon Zakai, who did his own LLVM based compiler\n\n1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:06.140\n that would take C or C++ and it would emit JavaScript.\n\n1:14:06.140 --> 1:14:07.660\n And you would think this is crazy.\n\n1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:09.820\n You're going from this sort of machine types,\n\n1:14:09.820 --> 1:14:13.100\n low level, controlled memory allocation language\n\n1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:16.380\n to this garbage collected, dynamically typed,\n\n1:14:16.380 --> 1:14:18.060\n high level, higher level language.\n\n1:14:18.060 --> 1:14:22.460\n But Alon sort of just phenomenologically carved nature\n\n1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:23.740\n of the joint and found the forms\n\n1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:25.380\n that were fast in JavaScript.\n\n1:14:25.380 --> 1:14:27.300\n And then with Dave Herman,\n\n1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:29.580\n who I'd recruited from Northeastern University,\n\n1:14:29.580 --> 1:14:31.280\n who was a type theorist,\n\n1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:33.840\n and Luke Wagner, who's still at Mozilla,\n\n1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:36.860\n who was the compiler guy and the JIT guy,\n\n1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:40.240\n they figured out how to codify what Alon had done\n\n1:14:40.240 --> 1:14:44.320\n into a typed subset of JavaScript called Asm.js.\n\n1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:45.700\n And this is a strange thing to think about\n\n1:14:45.700 --> 1:14:47.320\n because it doesn't have new syntax.\n\n1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:52.320\n The types are casts that occur in dominator positions\n\n1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:54.180\n in the control flow graph.\n\n1:14:54.180 --> 1:14:56.740\n So it's like a hack on JavaScript and it's a subset\n\n1:14:56.740 --> 1:14:58.380\n and it uses those bitwise operators\n\n1:14:58.380 --> 1:15:00.420\n that I talked about copying from Java\n\n1:15:00.420 --> 1:15:04.500\n to basically cast numeric types,\n\n1:15:04.500 --> 1:15:06.940\n which are double position flowing point, into integers.\n\n1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:10.600\n And so inside JavaScript, in the kernel semantics,\n\n1:15:10.600 --> 1:15:11.700\n are integers.\n\n1:15:11.700 --> 1:15:13.040\n And if you use these operators,\n\n1:15:13.040 --> 1:15:15.600\n if a compiler emits them in the right places,\n\n1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:18.500\n you can then treat them as typed values,\n\n1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:22.380\n typed memory locations, and you can type check your program.\n\n1:15:22.380 --> 1:15:24.940\n You can not only type check it, you can compile it.\n\n1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:27.480\n And this is all in sort of linear time, Alon.\n\n1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:30.420\n You can compile it to have deterministic performance.\n\n1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:32.580\n It doesn't touch the garbage collector.\n\n1:15:32.580 --> 1:15:35.500\n It calls a bunch of functions that come from the C functions\n\n1:15:35.500 --> 1:15:37.500\n or C++ code that you're compiling.\n\n1:15:37.500 --> 1:15:40.980\n And you can make the Epic Unreal Engine\n\n1:15:40.980 --> 1:15:43.620\n go in 30 frames a second.\n\n1:15:43.620 --> 1:15:46.900\n And when we did this in 2013 in the fall,\n\n1:15:46.900 --> 1:15:50.180\n Tim Sweeney and I didn't think it could be done quickly.\n\n1:15:50.180 --> 1:15:51.580\n Thought it would take years.\n\n1:15:51.580 --> 1:15:54.100\n And the team went to Raleigh, to Epic,\n\n1:15:54.100 --> 1:15:57.460\n and in four days they had Unreal Engine ported\n\n1:15:57.460 --> 1:15:59.980\n by pressing a compile button.\n\n1:15:59.980 --> 1:16:01.700\n But they had to have WebGL,\n\n1:16:01.700 --> 1:16:03.220\n which came from OpenGL.\n\n1:16:03.220 --> 1:16:06.020\n Yes, it came to OpenGL, which came from Silicon Graphics GL.\n\n1:16:06.020 --> 1:16:09.460\n They had to have Web Audio so they could map OpenAL,\n\n1:16:09.460 --> 1:16:11.740\n which was another audio library standard to Web Audio,\n\n1:16:11.740 --> 1:16:14.940\n which was kind of a Chrome idiosyncratic thing.\n\n1:16:14.940 --> 1:16:16.300\n But they could make it work.\n\n1:16:16.300 --> 1:16:21.100\n And they had to have Asm.js for fast C++ to JavaScript.\n\n1:16:21.100 --> 1:16:25.260\n And if you didn't have that fast compiler step,\n\n1:16:25.260 --> 1:16:27.380\n the JavaScript you'd write by hand\n\n1:16:27.380 --> 1:16:29.820\n trying to do an Unreal game would be too big and too slow.\n\n1:16:29.820 --> 1:16:31.420\n It would touch the garbage collector.\n\n1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.220\n It would not keep up with 30 frames a second\n\n1:16:33.220 --> 1:16:35.580\n on the hardware, 2013 hardware.\n\n1:16:35.580 --> 1:16:37.020\n So we demoed that at,\n\n1:16:38.540 --> 1:16:40.420\n this must have been fall 2012 now that I think about it.\n\n1:16:40.420 --> 1:16:42.340\n Because we demoed it at GDC,\n\n1:16:42.340 --> 1:16:44.420\n Game Developer Conference 2013.\n\n1:16:44.420 --> 1:16:45.420\n And people were stunned.\n\n1:16:45.420 --> 1:16:47.380\n That's like Unreal Engine, Unreal Tournament\n\n1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:48.860\n running in my browser window.\n\n1:16:48.860 --> 1:16:52.660\n No plugin, no Flash, no Java, no.\n\n1:16:52.660 --> 1:16:54.420\n So were those the early days of,\n\n1:16:54.420 --> 1:16:58.340\n because JavaScript now is able to run basically on par\n\n1:16:58.340 --> 1:17:01.860\n with a lot of the C++.\n\n1:17:01.860 --> 1:17:02.780\n And even before then,\n\n1:17:02.780 --> 1:17:05.340\n you had the fast JavaScript VMs in 2008\n\n1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:06.520\n when Chrome came out.\n\n1:17:06.520 --> 1:17:08.740\n Just before it came out, Mozilla,\n\n1:17:08.740 --> 1:17:11.660\n my friend Andreas Gal and I and others\n\n1:17:11.660 --> 1:17:14.420\n hacked out Trace Monkey, our Trace based JIT.\n\n1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:18.700\n The Squirrel Fish Extreme team at Apple did their JIT.\n\n1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:19.660\n And we were all competing\n\n1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:21.860\n on these crazy performance benchmarks.\n\n1:17:21.860 --> 1:17:23.520\n It was a little bit too much tuning to the benchmark.\n\n1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:25.180\n But JavaScript started getting fast\n\n1:17:25.180 --> 1:17:26.660\n and developers started noticing it.\n\n1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:29.740\n But it was still kind of its own high level language\n\n1:17:29.740 --> 1:17:30.740\n with garbage collection.\n\n1:17:30.740 --> 1:17:33.220\n The Asm.js step helped us go further\n\n1:17:33.220 --> 1:17:37.060\n because until we really proved the concept,\n\n1:17:37.060 --> 1:17:39.340\n people were still saying, well, JavaScript's okay.\n\n1:17:39.340 --> 1:17:40.980\n It's getting faster, thanks to V8.\n\n1:17:40.980 --> 1:17:43.300\n Everybody gave Google credit, especially Google.\n\n1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:44.900\n But we need something to kill Flash.\n\n1:17:44.900 --> 1:17:47.260\n Let's use the portable native client code\n\n1:17:47.260 --> 1:17:49.260\n that Google had acquired, native client.\n\n1:17:50.260 --> 1:17:52.940\n Which is a separate lineage for taking basically C code,\n\n1:17:52.940 --> 1:17:56.260\n compiling it into a software fault isolated container\n\n1:17:56.260 --> 1:17:59.740\n of some sort using some kind of virtualization technique.\n\n1:17:59.740 --> 1:18:01.620\n And maybe it can even be in process\n\n1:18:01.620 --> 1:18:03.080\n and still be memory safe, that would be awesome.\n\n1:18:03.080 --> 1:18:04.800\n But they ended up using process isolation too.\n\n1:18:04.800 --> 1:18:06.300\n And that kind of weakened it.\n\n1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:08.540\n And in the end, it was like portable native client,\n\n1:18:08.540 --> 1:18:11.060\n okay, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\n\n1:18:11.060 --> 1:18:13.260\n This is the Google Flash, right?\n\n1:18:13.260 --> 1:18:17.180\n But when we did Asm.js and we showed Unreal Engine working,\n\n1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:18.660\n I think it was only a matter of time\n\n1:18:18.660 --> 1:18:19.820\n before Google threw in the towel.\n\n1:18:19.820 --> 1:18:23.160\n And in fact, everybody agreed in spring of 2015,\n\n1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:25.500\n we're gonna take what was proven by Asm.js\n\n1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:29.460\n and make a new syntax, a binary syntax, it's efficient,\n\n1:18:29.460 --> 1:18:31.580\n that loads into the same JavaScript VM\n\n1:18:31.580 --> 1:18:32.620\n that JavaScript loads into.\n\n1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:34.780\n So there'll be two source languages, one VM,\n\n1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:36.220\n very important, one garbage collector,\n\n1:18:36.220 --> 1:18:40.780\n one memory manager, one set of compiler stages.\n\n1:18:40.780 --> 1:18:42.300\n And that's called WebAssembly.\n\n1:18:42.300 --> 1:18:44.260\n And that's the successor to Asm.js.\n\n1:18:44.260 --> 1:18:46.340\n And it's important that it have binary syntax\n\n1:18:46.340 --> 1:18:48.780\n because at the end of the day, especially on mobile,\n\n1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:50.100\n if you're downloading JavaScript,\n\n1:18:50.100 --> 1:18:52.040\n even if you're using LZ compression on the wire,\n\n1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:53.940\n that's cool, but you've got to blow it out into memory\n\n1:18:53.940 --> 1:18:56.860\n and then parse the silly eight character function keyword\n\n1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:00.820\n that I picked, when I should have used something shorter,\n\n1:19:00.820 --> 1:19:03.300\n I picked it because of awk, the Unix tool.\n\n1:19:04.540 --> 1:19:05.380\n So anyways.\n\n1:19:05.380 --> 1:19:07.940\n I want to, but I'm not following the awk thread.\n\n1:19:07.940 --> 1:19:09.780\n Yeah, don't worry about it.\n\n1:19:09.780 --> 1:19:12.260\n Is it surprising to you that,\n\n1:19:12.260 --> 1:19:14.660\n how damn fast JavaScript is these days?\n\n1:19:14.660 --> 1:19:16.900\n I mean, like, you've been through the whole journey.\n\n1:19:16.900 --> 1:19:19.640\n I know every step of the way, but is it like,\n\n1:19:19.640 --> 1:19:22.140\n I mean, it feels incredible.\n\n1:19:22.140 --> 1:19:24.220\n It does, but I knew, so the funny thing is,\n\n1:19:24.220 --> 1:19:26.860\n computer science is this big karmic wheel, right?\n\n1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:27.940\n Wheel of Fortuna.\n\n1:19:29.140 --> 1:19:32.460\n And in the, it's about the 97,\n\n1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:37.100\n I was loaned by Netscape to do due diligence for Sun\n\n1:19:37.100 --> 1:19:39.300\n in their acquisition of Anamorphic,\n\n1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:44.300\n which was David Unger and friends, people,\n\n1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:47.700\n Craig, I'm forgetting his name, he went to Microsoft.\n\n1:19:47.700 --> 1:19:51.180\n These Stanford language buffs who'd taken Smalltalk\n\n1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:53.500\n and then David create itself\n\n1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:56.260\n as a simpler sort of Smalltalk language\n\n1:19:56.260 --> 1:20:00.620\n and made really fast, just in time compiling VMs for them.\n\n1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:04.320\n And they, you know, well ahead of Java hotspot\n\n1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:07.660\n or JavaScript V8 or any of these modern VMs,\n\n1:20:07.660 --> 1:20:10.780\n figured out how to make dynamic code fast\n\n1:20:10.780 --> 1:20:13.100\n because Smalltalk is dynamic language, right?\n\n1:20:13.100 --> 1:20:16.420\n It has classes, it has, I think more lockdown declarative\n\n1:20:16.420 --> 1:20:18.500\n syntax than JavaScript, but it's fundamentally dynamic.\n\n1:20:18.500 --> 1:20:19.900\n You don't declare the types.\n\n1:20:19.900 --> 1:20:24.180\n But you could infer the types as the program runs\n\n1:20:24.180 --> 1:20:26.100\n and you start to form these ideas\n\n1:20:26.100 --> 1:20:29.100\n about what types are actually flowing through key operations\n\n1:20:29.100 --> 1:20:32.740\n and you form little so called polymorphic inline caches\n\n1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:35.660\n that are optimized machine code.\n\n1:20:35.660 --> 1:20:38.340\n The cache is the machine code that assumes,\n\n1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:40.180\n does a quick check to make sure the type is right\n\n1:20:40.180 --> 1:20:42.420\n and if it's not right, it bails to the interpreter.\n\n1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:44.500\n And if it is right, you go pretty fast.\n\n1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:47.100\n And that short test is a predicted branch,\n\n1:20:47.100 --> 1:20:48.660\n so things are pretty quick.\n\n1:20:48.660 --> 1:20:51.340\n All that amazing stuff I knew about in the 90s\n\n1:20:51.340 --> 1:20:53.780\n and I didn't have time to do it\n\n1:20:53.780 --> 1:20:57.220\n and Anamorphic got bought by Sun and they did hotspot.\n\n1:20:57.220 --> 1:21:00.060\n And you needed that even in Java because at scale,\n\n1:21:00.060 --> 1:21:04.340\n Java has some dynamic aspects due to invoke interface.\n\n1:21:04.340 --> 1:21:06.740\n You can have basically collections of Java code\n\n1:21:06.740 --> 1:21:10.900\n where you don't know at the time each module\n\n1:21:10.900 --> 1:21:13.900\n or package is compiled exactly what's being called,\n\n1:21:13.900 --> 1:21:16.300\n what subclass or what implementation\n\n1:21:16.300 --> 1:21:17.820\n of an interface is being called.\n\n1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:20.100\n And so you want to optimize using this sort of dynamic\n\n1:21:20.100 --> 1:21:21.740\n polymorphic caching there too.\n\n1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:24.620\n And they did that and hotspot, it's amazing beast.\n\n1:21:24.620 --> 1:21:27.740\n I've met like 13 people who all claim they created it.\n\n1:21:27.740 --> 1:21:30.580\n I think one of them may deserve credit more than others.\n\n1:21:31.620 --> 1:21:34.660\n But I didn't get to do that in JavaScript.\n\n1:21:34.660 --> 1:21:38.420\n And when we knew that Google was going to do their own\n\n1:21:38.420 --> 1:21:41.120\n browser, which we knew at Mozilla around 2006,\n\n1:21:42.420 --> 1:21:45.140\n I also met the team that did V8.\n\n1:21:45.140 --> 1:21:46.580\n And it turns out it was Lars Bach,\n\n1:21:46.580 --> 1:21:49.300\n who was one of the young engineers from Anamorphic\n\n1:21:49.300 --> 1:21:50.660\n that got acquired by Sun.\n\n1:21:50.660 --> 1:21:52.940\n And so Lars is like one of the world's expert\n\n1:21:52.940 --> 1:21:54.940\n on these kinds of virtual machines.\n\n1:21:54.940 --> 1:21:56.780\n And he picked my brains about JavaScript.\n\n1:21:56.780 --> 1:21:58.100\n I could tell he didn't like it at the time,\n\n1:21:58.100 --> 1:21:59.920\n but he had to do it.\n\n1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:00.760\n And...\n\n1:22:00.760 --> 1:22:01.580\n Oh, really interesting.\n\n1:22:01.580 --> 1:22:03.780\n Yeah, in 2006 lunch at Google's campus.\n\n1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:07.020\n And then I had another friend who was DevRel at Chrome\n\n1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:08.340\n and he said, yeah, we don't know what they're doing.\n\n1:22:08.340 --> 1:22:12.020\n This is getting 2007 to fall, getting toward 2008.\n\n1:22:12.020 --> 1:22:13.020\n We're trying to get Chrome out\n\n1:22:13.020 --> 1:22:14.500\n and we don't know what's going with the V8 team.\n\n1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:16.900\n They're off in Aarhus, Denmark,\n\n1:22:16.900 --> 1:22:19.300\n rewriting their engine four times, which is good.\n\n1:22:19.300 --> 1:22:22.300\n That's the right way to do this kind of development.\n\n1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:24.280\n They were learning JavaScript, including all its quirks,\n\n1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:27.020\n which they came to hate the fire of a thousand suns,\n\n1:22:27.020 --> 1:22:29.820\n which is one of the reasons that Lars and company did Dart,\n\n1:22:29.820 --> 1:22:30.940\n their own language.\n\n1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:32.900\n But they also made the language fast.\n\n1:22:32.900 --> 1:22:35.260\n And meanwhile, we knew this was happening.\n\n1:22:35.260 --> 1:22:38.500\n So we got our act together with Trace Monkey,\n\n1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:41.860\n our tracing JIT at Mozilla and Apple I think was also aware.\n\n1:22:41.860 --> 1:22:43.020\n And so they were doing their own JIT.\n\n1:22:43.020 --> 1:22:46.420\n So the era of JITed fast JavaScript in 2008\n\n1:22:46.420 --> 1:22:49.580\n had this prehistory going back to Smalltalk itself\n\n1:22:49.580 --> 1:22:50.980\n and Anamorphic.\n\n1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.100\n And again, the lineage is interesting\n\n1:22:53.100 --> 1:22:54.500\n because you had Lars and Anamorphic\n\n1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:55.980\n and then he ends up at Google.\n\n1:22:55.980 --> 1:23:00.160\n Yeah, and today we have an incredibly fast language\n\n1:23:00.160 --> 1:23:02.860\n that like you said, still,\n\n1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:04.780\n without hate, you can't have love.\n\n1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:09.780\n So I think there's both love and hate for this dance,\n\n1:23:09.820 --> 1:23:12.100\n this rich complex dance of JavaScript\n\n1:23:12.100 --> 1:23:12.940\n throughout its history.\n\n1:23:12.940 --> 1:23:15.300\n There's a dialectic for sure.\n\n1:23:15.300 --> 1:23:20.140\n Today, JavaScript is the most popular language in the world.\n\n1:23:20.140 --> 1:23:22.980\n Why by many measures?\n\n1:23:22.980 --> 1:23:24.700\n Why do you think that is?\n\n1:23:24.700 --> 1:23:28.420\n Is there some fundamental ideas\n\n1:23:28.420 --> 1:23:29.740\n that you've already spoke to a little bit\n\n1:23:29.740 --> 1:23:30.820\n but sort of broader\n\n1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:32.820\n that you think is the most popular language in the world?\n\n1:23:32.820 --> 1:23:36.220\n So I think I did, by doing first class functions\n\n1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:40.780\n and taking the good parts of the C operator hierarchy\n\n1:23:40.780 --> 1:23:44.060\n and just keeping things simple enough,\n\n1:23:44.060 --> 1:23:45.100\n maybe it could have been simpler\n\n1:23:45.100 --> 1:23:47.380\n but I had to make it look like Java\n\n1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:48.780\n and interoperate with Java\n\n1:23:48.780 --> 1:23:52.860\n that there was inherent goodness,\n\n1:23:52.860 --> 1:23:54.420\n Aristotelian quality there.\n\n1:23:54.420 --> 1:23:56.100\n And people perceive that\n\n1:23:56.100 --> 1:23:57.740\n even through all the quirks and warts.\n\n1:23:57.740 --> 1:23:59.940\n And then over time working on it with the standards body,\n\n1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:02.800\n working on it not only as a core language\n\n1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:06.660\n but in the context of HTML5 and making the browser better,\n\n1:24:06.660 --> 1:24:08.940\n listening to developers, thinking about,\n\n1:24:08.940 --> 1:24:10.860\n this is something that Nick Thompson wrote nicely\n\n1:24:10.860 --> 1:24:12.620\n about on Hacker News, I was very flattered.\n\n1:24:12.620 --> 1:24:14.300\n He said, Java was this thing\n\n1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:16.000\n where the experts were writing the code\n\n1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.020\n and it was compiled and you had to declare all your types\n\n1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:20.980\n and Sun didn't really give a damn about\n\n1:24:20.980 --> 1:24:23.820\n the average programmer who wanted to build real web apps,\n\n1:24:23.820 --> 1:24:25.060\n dynamic things.\n\n1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:28.820\n And I was in there meanwhile doing a bunch of people's jobs\n\n1:24:28.820 --> 1:24:31.580\n making JavaScript survive those early years\n\n1:24:31.580 --> 1:24:33.620\n when it was kind of touch and go.\n\n1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.140\n JavaScript was considered a Mickey Mouse language.\n\n1:24:36.140 --> 1:24:38.660\n It was for annoyances like the scrolling text\n\n1:24:38.660 --> 1:24:40.780\n at the bottom of the browser in the status bar.\n\n1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:43.060\n But I kept listening to developers working with them\n\n1:24:43.060 --> 1:24:46.860\n and trying to make it run in that single threaded event loop\n\n1:24:46.860 --> 1:24:47.720\n in a useful way.\n\n1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:49.880\n And I think that forged something\n\n1:24:49.880 --> 1:24:51.180\n that people have come to love.\n\n1:24:51.180 --> 1:24:53.700\n Now you don't always love the best thing, right?\n\n1:24:53.700 --> 1:24:57.020\n I talked about Shakespeare sonnet about\n\n1:24:58.620 --> 1:25:00.180\n I'm Mr. Sizer, nothing like the sun.\n\n1:25:00.180 --> 1:25:04.860\n Or the scene from Josh Whedon's film Serenity at the end\n\n1:25:04.860 --> 1:25:08.340\n where the actual piece in the score by David Newman\n\n1:25:08.340 --> 1:25:12.860\n is called Love where Captain Mal is teaching River Tam\n\n1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:13.860\n about how to pilot the ship.\n\n1:25:13.860 --> 1:25:15.380\n And she's a super genius, super soldier.\n\n1:25:15.380 --> 1:25:17.100\n She knows how to do it already.\n\n1:25:17.100 --> 1:25:19.500\n And he's basically talking about how you have to love\n\n1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:22.020\n the ship because if you don't, it's going to kill you.\n\n1:25:22.020 --> 1:25:23.860\n And then the piece falls off the ship.\n\n1:25:23.860 --> 1:25:26.060\n It's kind of like JavaScript.\n\n1:25:26.060 --> 1:25:26.900\n You have to love it.\n\n1:25:26.900 --> 1:25:30.020\n You have to love it because now people say we're stuck\n\n1:25:30.020 --> 1:25:31.620\n with it because it got this priority of place.\n\n1:25:31.620 --> 1:25:33.340\n But there's love underpinning that.\n\n1:25:33.340 --> 1:25:35.860\n And actually the listening to developers,\n\n1:25:35.860 --> 1:25:36.700\n that's kind of beautiful.\n\n1:25:36.700 --> 1:25:41.140\n There's most successful products in this world\n\n1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:43.100\n with all the messes, with all the flaws.\n\n1:25:43.100 --> 1:25:45.360\n Perhaps the flaws themselves are actual features,\n\n1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:48.180\n but that's a whole nother, that's a discussion about love.\n\n1:25:48.180 --> 1:25:50.220\n But underneath it, there's something\n\n1:25:50.220 --> 1:25:52.420\n that just connects with people.\n\n1:25:52.420 --> 1:25:53.480\n And it has to keep connecting.\n\n1:25:53.480 --> 1:25:55.640\n If JavaScript kind of went off in this,\n\n1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:57.340\n people sometimes complain about ES6.\n\n1:25:57.340 --> 1:25:58.700\n Oh, you put classes in JavaScript.\n\n1:25:58.700 --> 1:25:59.540\n I hate classes.\n\n1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:00.420\n You've ruined it.\n\n1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:01.420\n But it's not true.\n\n1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:02.660\n It's a dynamic language.\n\n1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:04.820\n Smalltalk had classes.\n\n1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:07.060\n Python has classes.\n\n1:26:07.060 --> 1:26:10.120\n There are lots of Lisp variants that have classy systems.\n\n1:26:12.740 --> 1:26:16.780\n So people who don't reject it based on some sort\n\n1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:21.780\n of fashion judgment do use it and do interact\n\n1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:23.380\n with the standards body.\n\n1:26:23.380 --> 1:26:25.840\n The standards body is competing browser vendors mainly,\n\n1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:28.480\n but also now big companies that use JavaScript heavily,\n\n1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:32.980\n the Paypal's and other such companies, Salesforce.\n\n1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:36.300\n And they have to cater to web developers.\n\n1:26:36.300 --> 1:26:39.020\n They have to hire developers who know JavaScript.\n\n1:26:39.020 --> 1:26:43.100\n They have to keep their engines up to the latest standard.\n\n1:26:43.100 --> 1:26:45.900\n And this creates all this sort of social structure\n\n1:26:45.900 --> 1:26:47.820\n around JavaScript that is unusual.\n\n1:26:47.820 --> 1:26:51.420\n I mean, you get C++ buffs that follow the inner workings\n\n1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:54.460\n of C++, what is it now?\n\n1:26:54.460 --> 1:26:56.580\n 21 something, I don't know.\n\n1:26:56.580 --> 1:26:57.500\n I've lost track.\n\n1:26:57.500 --> 1:26:59.020\n But it's a more rarefied group.\n\n1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:02.860\n It's more like the old language, gray hairs.\n\n1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:04.500\n Whereas JavaScript is a younger\n\n1:27:04.500 --> 1:27:07.380\n and more vibrant and large crowd.\n\n1:27:07.380 --> 1:27:09.260\n There's a community feel to it.\n\n1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:13.180\n There's echoes, perhaps I don't wanna draw too many\n\n1:27:13.180 --> 1:27:15.420\n similarities, maybe you can comment on it.\n\n1:27:15.420 --> 1:27:18.980\n There's C++ is like Wall Street,\n\n1:27:18.980 --> 1:27:21.220\n and the JavaScript is like Wall Street bets\n\n1:27:21.220 --> 1:27:22.620\n from the recent events.\n\n1:27:22.620 --> 1:27:24.940\n It's like there's a chaotic community of all,\n\n1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:28.820\n and there's some power from that distributed crowd\n\n1:27:28.820 --> 1:27:30.260\n of people that ultimately.\n\n1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:32.660\n It's more thematic, it's more of the people.\n\n1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:35.860\n It lets people in without requiring these credentials.\n\n1:27:35.860 --> 1:27:38.420\n I remember in the late 90s into the 90s,\n\n1:27:38.420 --> 1:27:39.900\n people were all getting Java credentials.\n\n1:27:39.900 --> 1:27:42.700\n And I knew people, and friends knew people\n\n1:27:42.700 --> 1:27:44.580\n who became Java programmers, and you knew\n\n1:27:44.580 --> 1:27:47.260\n they really should have been like nature guides or pilots.\n\n1:27:47.260 --> 1:27:49.020\n They hated programming, but they thought,\n\n1:27:49.020 --> 1:27:51.780\n I gotta make money, I'm gonna become a Java programmer.\n\n1:27:51.780 --> 1:27:55.060\n Do you have some, because it's such a monumental moment\n\n1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:58.060\n in our current history, as a quick aside,\n\n1:27:58.060 --> 1:28:03.060\n do you have thoughts about this huge distributed crowdsourced\n\n1:28:03.260 --> 1:28:06.740\n financial happenings with Wall Street bets?\n\n1:28:06.740 --> 1:28:08.780\n That's like nobody could have, well,\n\n1:28:08.780 --> 1:28:11.420\n you could have predicted, but the scale and the impact\n\n1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:13.260\n of this kind of emergent behavior\n\n1:28:13.260 --> 1:28:15.780\n from independent parties that could happen.\n\n1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:19.900\n Like I said, my own experience with the dismal science,\n\n1:28:19.900 --> 1:28:23.500\n as with physics, led me to reject a lot of bad models.\n\n1:28:23.500 --> 1:28:26.260\n Economics was always compromised by politics,\n\n1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:28.220\n political economy.\n\n1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:29.460\n You could also argue that it was,\n\n1:28:29.460 --> 1:28:30.980\n it used to be a branch of moral philosophy,\n\n1:28:30.980 --> 1:28:32.460\n so it was concerned with the good,\n\n1:28:32.460 --> 1:28:34.740\n and it became divorced and became sort of\n\n1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:37.700\n in this quasi Newtonian way, just about,\n\n1:28:37.700 --> 1:28:40.220\n everything's just running by itself, don't worry about it.\n\n1:28:40.220 --> 1:28:42.060\n This monopoly's crushing your Netscape company,\n\n1:28:42.060 --> 1:28:43.700\n but that's just nature.\n\n1:28:43.700 --> 1:28:46.580\n And economics couldn't, or doesn't really have good models\n\n1:28:46.580 --> 1:28:49.500\n for the Wall Street bets subreddit.\n\n1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:52.300\n You know, they know how to squeeze a short, right?\n\n1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:56.460\n So the amazing thing is you have Robinhood app,\n\n1:28:56.460 --> 1:29:00.740\n which was, again, supposedly for the demos, for the people,\n\n1:29:00.740 --> 1:29:05.180\n and eliminated the fee through various kinds of straddles\n\n1:29:06.300 --> 1:29:09.220\n or some kind of spread operation\n\n1:29:09.220 --> 1:29:11.860\n that helped them eliminate the fee or eat the fee.\n\n1:29:11.860 --> 1:29:14.540\n And in fact, as a broker in these days,\n\n1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:15.820\n because it takes two days to settle,\n\n1:29:15.820 --> 1:29:18.620\n there's counterparty risk, as they found out.\n\n1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:22.980\n And so the Wall Street bets people,\n\n1:29:22.980 --> 1:29:25.700\n you know, the memes are like the Terminator robot\n\n1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:30.140\n with the $600 STEMI check and the hedge funds\n\n1:29:30.140 --> 1:29:32.420\n that make little girl hiding under the desk.\n\n1:29:34.060 --> 1:29:36.060\n There is a problem, which I talked about\n\n1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:38.300\n in a recent podcast, which I'm conscious of\n\n1:29:38.300 --> 1:29:40.020\n from the history of the web, and that is,\n\n1:29:40.020 --> 1:29:41.260\n you could say it's monopoly,\n\n1:29:41.260 --> 1:29:42.980\n which antitrust wasn't enforced\n\n1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:45.140\n after USB Microsoft for a long time.\n\n1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:48.020\n And a lot of this was due to the money interests\n\n1:29:48.020 --> 1:29:50.900\n buying control of politicians.\n\n1:29:50.900 --> 1:29:54.460\n And, you know, in Plato's five regimes, that's oligarchy.\n\n1:29:54.460 --> 1:29:56.060\n That's where we are.\n\n1:29:56.060 --> 1:29:58.780\n And now we're seeing a fight against the oligarchs.\n\n1:29:58.780 --> 1:29:59.620\n I don't know if it'll work,\n\n1:29:59.620 --> 1:30:00.780\n but you're definitely seeing it.\n\n1:30:00.780 --> 1:30:02.420\n And it's also kind of hackerish, right?\n\n1:30:02.420 --> 1:30:04.100\n It's got a hacker ethos.\n\n1:30:04.100 --> 1:30:05.660\n You know, hey, Robinhood, no fees.\n\n1:30:05.660 --> 1:30:06.500\n Oh, interesting.\n\n1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:09.180\n Hey, you know, I could buy a fraction of a share\n\n1:30:09.180 --> 1:30:12.300\n in this thing, or I can keep buying with my stimulus check.\n\n1:30:12.300 --> 1:30:16.980\n So I mentioned Hegel seeing Napoleon on the horse, right?\n\n1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:19.220\n Hegel also talked about the cunning of reason\n\n1:30:19.220 --> 1:30:21.380\n that you have this sort of, you know,\n\n1:30:21.380 --> 1:30:24.100\n God sees history in full, and if you believe in God,\n\n1:30:24.100 --> 1:30:25.940\n or, you know, we don't know the future,\n\n1:30:25.940 --> 1:30:28.380\n but there's always this sort of fly in the ointment,\n\n1:30:28.380 --> 1:30:32.140\n this unintended consequence that confounds\n\n1:30:32.140 --> 1:30:35.660\n the best plans of the powers that be.\n\n1:30:35.660 --> 1:30:37.060\n And we're living through it.\n\n1:30:37.060 --> 1:30:39.700\n I'm glad it's not, you know, street warfare\n\n1:30:39.700 --> 1:30:43.380\n or mechanized warfare, because it has been in the past.\n\n1:30:43.380 --> 1:30:48.380\n It's more like soft power, and people are fighting back.\n\n1:30:50.620 --> 1:30:51.740\n Do you think it's possible?\n\n1:30:51.740 --> 1:30:56.740\n So JavaScript used to be for the front end of the web.\n\n1:30:57.100 --> 1:31:01.620\n It's now increasingly so being used for back end,\n\n1:31:01.620 --> 1:31:06.060\n like running stuff that's like behind the scenes.\n\n1:31:06.060 --> 1:31:10.260\n And it's also starting to be used quite a bit\n\n1:31:10.260 --> 1:31:12.260\n for things like TensorFlow.js.\n\n1:31:12.260 --> 1:31:14.700\n So starting to actually use like these heavy duty\n\n1:31:14.700 --> 1:31:17.140\n applications that are using neural networks,\n\n1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:19.380\n machine learning, and so on in the browser.\n\n1:31:19.380 --> 1:31:24.140\n Is it possible in 10, 20, 30 years\n\n1:31:24.140 --> 1:31:28.660\n that basically most of the world runs on JavaScript?\n\n1:31:28.660 --> 1:31:31.260\n This is a dystopia and a nightmare to some people.\n\n1:31:32.380 --> 1:31:34.940\n When we did Asm.js and WebAssembly,\n\n1:31:34.940 --> 1:31:37.340\n I would joke and mean people with scenes like\n\n1:31:37.340 --> 1:31:39.500\n Neo waking up in his pod in the matrix,\n\n1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:42.380\n and he's all skinny and weak and hairless.\n\n1:31:42.380 --> 1:31:46.220\n And, you know, you realize in the future\n\n1:31:46.220 --> 1:31:48.020\n that you're living in some simulation\n\n1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:49.180\n that it's all running on JavaScript,\n\n1:31:49.180 --> 1:31:50.580\n and you just scream forever.\n\n1:31:51.980 --> 1:31:52.820\n It's possible.\n\n1:31:52.820 --> 1:31:54.860\n Gary Bernhardt does these funny talks.\n\n1:31:54.860 --> 1:31:56.860\n He did watch.js, and then he did this\n\n1:31:58.020 --> 1:31:59.540\n life and death of JavaScript, I think it's called,\n\n1:31:59.540 --> 1:32:02.580\n where he took some clever ideas that actually have\n\n1:32:02.580 --> 1:32:05.340\n a thread of credibility to them.\n\n1:32:05.340 --> 1:32:09.220\n But I mentioned software fault isolation.\n\n1:32:09.220 --> 1:32:10.620\n In the old days, when we were using computers,\n\n1:32:10.620 --> 1:32:14.140\n we said we're gonna use the Unix monolithic monitor,\n\n1:32:14.140 --> 1:32:15.980\n and it's the privileged program.\n\n1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:18.420\n This is before you even had hardware rings of protection.\n\n1:32:18.420 --> 1:32:20.460\n Those, some of the early 60s operating systems\n\n1:32:20.460 --> 1:32:22.700\n used hardware protection zones.\n\n1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:25.900\n But Unix is privileged, and the program\n\n1:32:25.900 --> 1:32:30.460\n that runs user code in a process is hosted.\n\n1:32:30.460 --> 1:32:33.660\n It's the guest, in the host, and you get to suspend it.\n\n1:32:33.660 --> 1:32:35.220\n You get to kill it.\n\n1:32:35.220 --> 1:32:37.300\n If it crashes, it doesn't take down the whole OS.\n\n1:32:37.300 --> 1:32:41.940\n It's a wonderful idea, but the call into the kernel\n\n1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:43.820\n is expensive, the system call, so called.\n\n1:32:43.820 --> 1:32:45.180\n And this has even been optimized now\n\n1:32:45.180 --> 1:32:46.320\n for things like getting the time of day,\n\n1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:48.420\n so it doesn't actually enter the kernel.\n\n1:32:49.580 --> 1:32:52.780\n And meanwhile, hardware architectures\n\n1:32:52.780 --> 1:32:54.460\n and virtualization techniques have gone\n\n1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:56.380\n in a different direction, even to the point\n\n1:32:56.380 --> 1:32:58.840\n where you can do software fault isolation very cheaply\n\n1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:00.740\n without entering the operating system kernel,\n\n1:33:00.740 --> 1:33:02.940\n and so you get unikernels and exokernels\n\n1:33:02.940 --> 1:33:04.460\n and very lightweight VMs.\n\n1:33:04.460 --> 1:33:08.060\n And so Gary took this idea and said, JavaScript\n\n1:33:08.060 --> 1:33:10.540\n will take over computing, because the system call\n\n1:33:10.540 --> 1:33:12.340\n boundary's too expensive, so everything ends up\n\n1:33:12.340 --> 1:33:14.220\n in JavaScript with these lighter weight\n\n1:33:14.220 --> 1:33:16.940\n isolation enforcement mechanisms.\n\n1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:18.580\n It's not totally beyond belief.\n\n1:33:18.580 --> 1:33:20.880\n It'd be WebAssembly too.\n\n1:33:22.100 --> 1:33:25.380\n It's nice to ask you sort of for advice to,\n\n1:33:25.380 --> 1:33:26.980\n there's so many people that are interested\n\n1:33:26.980 --> 1:33:29.180\n in starting to learning about programming,\n\n1:33:29.180 --> 1:33:31.180\n getting into this world.\n\n1:33:31.180 --> 1:33:34.980\n Is there some number of languages,\n\n1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:36.460\n three to five programming languages\n\n1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:38.220\n that you would recommend people learn,\n\n1:33:38.220 --> 1:33:42.060\n or maybe a broader advice on how\n\n1:33:42.060 --> 1:33:43.940\n to get started in programming?\n\n1:33:43.940 --> 1:33:45.380\n Well, so you asked about machine learning,\n\n1:33:45.380 --> 1:33:47.820\n and JavaScript is a general purpose language,\n\n1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:52.820\n and it's a language that's not that great\n\n1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:58.100\n for doing matrix operations or doing parallel programming,\n\n1:33:58.100 --> 1:34:01.100\n I would say, without using some extensions\n\n1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:03.620\n or some libraries that have some magic in them.\n\n1:34:03.620 --> 1:34:06.800\n So if someone wanted to learn,\n\n1:34:08.580 --> 1:34:11.100\n there are amazing languages in sort of the APL family\n\n1:34:11.100 --> 1:34:14.060\n that are very useful for, I would say, linear algebra,\n\n1:34:14.060 --> 1:34:16.820\n which gets to a lot of the kernels in machine learning.\n\n1:34:16.820 --> 1:34:21.820\n And so APL had like J and then K and their K variants\n\n1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:24.660\n because the guy that did K is still going,\n\n1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:28.900\n and they're proprietary, but he's still innovating there.\n\n1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:30.420\n There are, you know, Python is used.\n\n1:34:30.420 --> 1:34:31.740\n So people talk about TensorFlow.js.\n\n1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:33.460\n Well, it's not that surprising\n\n1:34:33.460 --> 1:34:36.380\n because Python was heavily used for machine learning,\n\n1:34:36.380 --> 1:34:38.740\n and Python was always, you know,\n\n1:34:38.740 --> 1:34:41.540\n they didn't have this fast just in time compiler tradition.\n\n1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:43.180\n There were some projects that tried this,\n\n1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:45.340\n and some of them were interesting.\n\n1:34:45.340 --> 1:34:46.300\n PyPy was interesting,\n\n1:34:46.300 --> 1:34:50.020\n but the philosophy with Python was,\n\n1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:51.780\n oh, you need to go fast, write a C plugin,\n\n1:34:51.780 --> 1:34:53.300\n and drop into C code.\n\n1:34:53.300 --> 1:34:57.500\n So I think people should look at multiple languages\n\n1:34:57.500 --> 1:34:59.500\n because there are different tools in the belt.\n\n1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:02.820\n If you're trying to do supervision or rapid prototyping,\n\n1:35:02.820 --> 1:35:03.900\n you want a dynamic language.\n\n1:35:03.900 --> 1:35:06.500\n You want to throw things together and see what works.\n\n1:35:06.500 --> 1:35:09.280\n If you are trying to go down to the metal very fast,\n\n1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:10.740\n well, I'm an old C hacker,\n\n1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:14.300\n but I was also the executive sponsor of Rust at Mozilla,\n\n1:35:14.300 --> 1:35:16.180\n and Rust has now escaped, you know,\n\n1:35:16.180 --> 1:35:18.540\n from that sort of nest where it was born\n\n1:35:18.540 --> 1:35:21.460\n to be adopted by a bunch of companies\n\n1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:23.220\n that have a foundation in the works.\n\n1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:24.780\n Some of the key core team members\n\n1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:27.700\n are working now at Amazon and other places.\n\n1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:30.100\n So it looks like Rust has reached escape velocity,\n\n1:35:30.100 --> 1:35:31.380\n and Rust is an interesting language\n\n1:35:31.380 --> 1:35:33.060\n because one of our goals there,\n\n1:35:33.060 --> 1:35:35.300\n one of the reasons I sponsored it was we were all tired\n\n1:35:35.300 --> 1:35:38.100\n of seeing those remote code execution vulnerabilities\n\n1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:41.240\n due to C and C++, and we thought,\n\n1:35:41.240 --> 1:35:43.840\n can we have a sort of safety property\n\n1:35:43.840 --> 1:35:46.920\n through a type and effect system or an ownership system,\n\n1:35:46.920 --> 1:35:48.300\n and Rust has that.\n\n1:35:48.300 --> 1:35:50.020\n And that ownership system is interesting\n\n1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:52.140\n because it doesn't just give you memory safety.\n\n1:35:52.140 --> 1:35:53.500\n There's a sort of theorem for free,\n\n1:35:53.500 --> 1:35:57.220\n a dual that falls out for protection against data races.\n\n1:35:57.220 --> 1:35:59.740\n So Rust is better for low level programming.\n\n1:35:59.740 --> 1:36:01.100\n You delimit your unsafe code\n\n1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:02.900\n where you do have to be unsafe,\n\n1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:05.300\n and you can prove certain facts about memory safety\n\n1:36:05.300 --> 1:36:08.820\n and race condition avoidance.\n\n1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:11.340\n And so I think people should learn these new languages.\n\n1:36:11.340 --> 1:36:13.380\n I think Go is a great language.\n\n1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:16.540\n I admire, you know, the Unix people who did that.\n\n1:36:16.540 --> 1:36:20.580\n Ken Stoll was involved, Rob Pike, of course, David,\n\n1:36:21.420 --> 1:36:23.440\n what's his name, and other people.\n\n1:36:23.440 --> 1:36:27.100\n Go is a huge success, really on the server side,\n\n1:36:27.100 --> 1:36:30.140\n anywhere you have a lot of networking to do,\n\n1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:33.780\n and it's garbage collected, but it's also very pragmatic.\n\n1:36:33.780 --> 1:36:35.420\n It has that sort of C flavor.\n\n1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:37.020\n As an old C hacker, I can't get used to the fact\n\n1:36:37.020 --> 1:36:39.620\n that they swapped the type and declarator\n\n1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:41.140\n in the declaration order.\n\n1:36:41.140 --> 1:36:44.180\n I haven't used Rust, but this is one of the most respected\n\n1:36:44.180 --> 1:36:46.260\n and loved languages currently, so it's interesting.\n\n1:36:46.260 --> 1:36:47.380\n Yeah, and it's still young.\n\n1:36:47.380 --> 1:36:50.980\n You look at these things, JavaScript is now considered old.\n\n1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:52.500\n It's gone through so many versions\n\n1:36:52.500 --> 1:36:54.860\n that you can fall in love with it all over again.\n\n1:36:54.860 --> 1:36:57.740\n 25 plus years, you know, it's an adult.\n\n1:36:58.740 --> 1:36:59.800\n It should be out of the house.\n\n1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:03.420\n But it could be around another 25 years.\n\n1:37:03.420 --> 1:37:04.240\n Cannot rule it out.\n\n1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:06.260\n So Rust will be around for a long time.\n\n1:37:06.260 --> 1:37:08.900\n The longer you're around, the more likely you're Lindy,\n\n1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:10.400\n and you're around your wife.\n\n1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:11.900\n A lot of people ask me, like,\n\n1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:15.780\n I'm often torn between recommending either Python\n\n1:37:15.780 --> 1:37:18.100\n or JavaScript as the first language to play with,\n\n1:37:18.100 --> 1:37:20.900\n because, I mean, it's difficult,\n\n1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:25.180\n because it's so easy to do JavaScript incorrectly.\n\n1:37:25.180 --> 1:37:29.460\n It's much easier to do it correctly these days,\n\n1:37:29.460 --> 1:37:31.620\n or like, well, learn about programming.\n\n1:37:31.620 --> 1:37:33.940\n But the cool thing about JavaScript\n\n1:37:33.940 --> 1:37:36.100\n is that you can create stuff\n\n1:37:36.100 --> 1:37:38.140\n that will put a smile on your face.\n\n1:37:38.140 --> 1:37:41.460\n Like, as a developer, you can create stuff,\n\n1:37:41.460 --> 1:37:43.060\n and it'll visually look like something,\n\n1:37:43.060 --> 1:37:45.700\n and it'll do stuff, and it makes you feel good.\n\n1:37:45.700 --> 1:37:47.340\n It makes you fall in love with programming.\n\n1:37:47.340 --> 1:37:48.700\n With Python, you could do the same.\n\n1:37:48.700 --> 1:37:49.540\n It's a little slower.\n\n1:37:49.540 --> 1:37:51.580\n And with C++, it takes five to 10 years\n\n1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:54.100\n to write a program that actually does something.\n\n1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:56.820\n So, like, there's that tension between\n\n1:37:56.820 --> 1:37:59.460\n is JavaScript the right first step, or is it Python?\n\n1:37:59.460 --> 1:38:02.060\n And I've been going back and forth on those two.\n\n1:38:02.060 --> 1:38:05.300\n My Python, right, it came from a lineage of ABC,\n\n1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:08.600\n which was a pedagogical language in the Netherlands.\n\n1:38:09.580 --> 1:38:12.140\n And it, you know,\n\n1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:16.700\n it was a good teaching language, too.\n\n1:38:16.700 --> 1:38:17.980\n I think it is a good teaching language,\n\n1:38:17.980 --> 1:38:19.100\n and it's a little more restrictive\n\n1:38:19.100 --> 1:38:21.980\n in that if you misspell something\n\n1:38:21.980 --> 1:38:25.220\n in a way that JavaScript might let run,\n\n1:38:25.220 --> 1:38:26.860\n let reach runtime, it'll get stopped\n\n1:38:26.860 --> 1:38:30.600\n at syntax check in Python.\n\n1:38:30.600 --> 1:38:31.700\n That's good for beginners.\n\n1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:34.760\n I think the sloppiness that some people object to,\n\n1:38:34.760 --> 1:38:37.140\n like, people were just tweeting at me,\n\n1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:38.660\n having just learned JavaScript.\n\n1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:41.160\n They said, I can take a number, and I can index into it,\n\n1:38:41.160 --> 1:38:43.180\n and get undefined out of it as a property.\n\n1:38:43.180 --> 1:38:44.020\n Why is that?\n\n1:38:44.020 --> 1:38:44.860\n A number's not an object.\n\n1:38:44.860 --> 1:38:46.180\n And I explained why it is,\n\n1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:48.340\n because like in Java, the primitive types,\n\n1:38:48.340 --> 1:38:49.840\n which unfortunately are not objects,\n\n1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.260\n can be automatically boxed or wrapped by an object.\n\n1:38:53.260 --> 1:38:55.440\n And I made that implicit.\n\n1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.240\n In Java, it's typed, and you have to declare things,\n\n1:38:58.240 --> 1:39:00.500\n and you'll get type errors.\n\n1:39:00.500 --> 1:39:03.080\n But there are cases in Java where you get auto boxing\n\n1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:06.020\n or auto wrapping, because you've declared that you want it.\n\n1:39:06.020 --> 1:39:07.580\n In JavaScript, it just happens.\n\n1:39:07.580 --> 1:39:10.300\n And so once I explained it, like, oh, wow, I get it.\n\n1:39:10.300 --> 1:39:13.540\n But it also means that you can commit a blunder that just.\n\n1:39:13.540 --> 1:39:15.360\n You don't get punished for it, you don't detect.\n\n1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:16.800\n You get an undefined value,\n\n1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:17.860\n and you don't know where it came from.\n\n1:39:17.860 --> 1:39:18.700\n Right.\n\n1:39:19.900 --> 1:39:23.340\n I've been reading a lot about military history recently.\n\n1:39:23.340 --> 1:39:26.780\n And one way to paint the picture of browsers,\n\n1:39:26.780 --> 1:39:29.280\n internet browsers, is through the various wars\n\n1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:30.620\n throughout its history.\n\n1:39:30.620 --> 1:39:32.300\n I don't know if that's a useful way to look at it,\n\n1:39:32.300 --> 1:39:34.660\n but we've already talked a little bit about Netscape\n\n1:39:34.660 --> 1:39:38.420\n and Internet Explorer in the early days.\n\n1:39:38.420 --> 1:39:41.260\n Can you tell the story of the different wars,\n\n1:39:41.260 --> 1:39:43.420\n if that's at all an interesting way to look at it,\n\n1:39:43.420 --> 1:39:46.460\n of the 90s and to today?\n\n1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:47.300\n Yeah.\n\n1:39:47.300 --> 1:39:49.100\n So I mentioned that Microsoft, you know,\n\n1:39:49.100 --> 1:39:51.500\n which was convicted for it, did abuse its monopoly,\n\n1:39:51.500 --> 1:39:55.100\n but they had a pretty good team by the time they did IE4.\n\n1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:57.900\n And Netscape, unfortunately, I was like second floor,\n\n1:39:57.900 --> 1:39:59.540\n and I was friends with all the first floor people,\n\n1:39:59.540 --> 1:40:02.700\n the front end guys who did the JavaScript event hookup\n\n1:40:02.700 --> 1:40:03.740\n and things like that,\n\n1:40:04.700 --> 1:40:07.580\n that that team was fairly burnt out.\n\n1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:10.900\n And I think having gone public,\n\n1:40:10.900 --> 1:40:13.300\n the upper management wanted to buy a bunch of companies\n\n1:40:13.300 --> 1:40:15.340\n to try to go head to head with Microsoft.\n\n1:40:15.340 --> 1:40:17.740\n Didn't work, but buying a bunch of companies\n\n1:40:17.740 --> 1:40:19.380\n usually doesn't work.\n\n1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:22.800\n I think the modern sort of approach roughly\n\n1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:25.260\n is like Mark Zuckerberg took,\n\n1:40:25.260 --> 1:40:26.860\n which is to keep them at arm's length\n\n1:40:26.860 --> 1:40:28.300\n and let them do their thing.\n\n1:40:28.300 --> 1:40:29.900\n And now that he's pulling WhatsApp in\n\n1:40:29.900 --> 1:40:31.420\n and people are fleeing it\n\n1:40:31.420 --> 1:40:33.480\n because it's tied into the ad surveillance.\n\n1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:36.260\n But, you know, for a while,\n\n1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:37.660\n they're keeping it separate really does work\n\n1:40:37.660 --> 1:40:39.020\n because you bought it for its value,\n\n1:40:39.020 --> 1:40:41.140\n it's complimentary, and you're not messing with it.\n\n1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:43.600\n With Netscape, when they bought a bunch of companies,\n\n1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:45.500\n they had some of the first floor people\n\n1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:46.940\n or the founders burned out.\n\n1:40:46.940 --> 1:40:51.460\n They had newcomers who wanted their turn to do the browser,\n\n1:40:51.460 --> 1:40:54.540\n and they hadn't really done browsers or understood them.\n\n1:40:54.540 --> 1:40:57.340\n And so Netscape 4 was originally supposed to be 3,\n\n1:40:57.340 --> 1:40:58.820\n and it was so late, they renumbered it.\n\n1:40:58.820 --> 1:41:00.560\n We did a 3 release.\n\n1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:03.060\n Jamie and a few others put some extra effort into.\n\n1:41:03.060 --> 1:41:08.060\n SecureMine was supported in the built in mail program.\n\n1:41:08.340 --> 1:41:10.200\n And Netscape 4 was late,\n\n1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:11.860\n and it was only on Windows at first,\n\n1:41:11.860 --> 1:41:14.920\n and Microsoft had really started doing better,\n\n1:41:14.920 --> 1:41:15.760\n like they do.\n\n1:41:15.760 --> 1:41:17.300\n They copy, and the first version's trash,\n\n1:41:17.300 --> 1:41:19.100\n and the second one, you're starting to feel threatened.\n\n1:41:19.100 --> 1:41:21.460\n The third one, you can tell what's gonna happen,\n\n1:41:21.460 --> 1:41:22.460\n and the fourth one's good.\n\n1:41:22.460 --> 1:41:24.260\n And plus there's the benefit, like you said,\n\n1:41:24.260 --> 1:41:26.120\n that it comes as a default browser.\n\n1:41:26.120 --> 1:41:28.780\n Yes, and yet Netscape's screwing it up,\n\n1:41:28.780 --> 1:41:32.540\n and Microsoft really putting some quality people on it.\n\n1:41:32.540 --> 1:41:33.380\n IE4 was good.\n\n1:41:33.380 --> 1:41:34.220\n On Windows, it was good.\n\n1:41:34.220 --> 1:41:37.180\n And they did the dynamic HTML innovations.\n\n1:41:38.300 --> 1:41:39.700\n Scott Isaac's my old buddy,\n\n1:41:39.700 --> 1:41:42.360\n a former accountant who programmed in BASIC\n\n1:41:42.360 --> 1:41:45.500\n and became what Microsoft calls a program manager,\n\n1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:47.300\n which is kind of an elevated position.\n\n1:41:48.760 --> 1:41:50.500\n You can be a programmer or an engineer and track,\n\n1:41:50.500 --> 1:41:51.340\n but you switch to it,\n\n1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:54.700\n and you sort of lead a lot of design and standards efforts.\n\n1:41:54.700 --> 1:41:58.940\n And so Scott Isaac put in a lot of those funky DHTML APIs\n\n1:41:58.940 --> 1:42:01.020\n that didn't quite have the same flavor\n\n1:42:01.020 --> 1:42:03.260\n as the stuff that I did, and neither of them\n\n1:42:03.260 --> 1:42:05.540\n was like the later sort of verbose Java,\n\n1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:08.540\n like DOM W3C standardized.\n\n1:42:08.540 --> 1:42:10.540\n But IE4 was pretty darn good.\n\n1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:12.460\n I remember a friend, Scott Furman and I,\n\n1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:16.700\n got invited by Scott Isaac to Gordon Beers in San Jose.\n\n1:42:16.700 --> 1:42:19.340\n They were doing a preview of IE4.\n\n1:42:19.340 --> 1:42:21.500\n This must have been 1997.\n\n1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:25.140\n And Scott said, yeah, here's the new graphics stuff\n\n1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:25.980\n we're doing.\n\n1:42:25.980 --> 1:42:28.220\n We've got something like your Netscape layers.\n\n1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:31.740\n We've got VML, a vector markup language.\n\n1:42:31.740 --> 1:42:33.420\n We can do virtual reality.\n\n1:42:33.420 --> 1:42:35.260\n And Scott and I looked at each other and said,\n\n1:42:35.260 --> 1:42:36.820\n we're doomed, right?\n\n1:42:36.820 --> 1:42:38.780\n Microsoft was starting to fire on all cylinders.\n\n1:42:38.780 --> 1:42:40.460\n So I have to give them credit for that,\n\n1:42:40.460 --> 1:42:42.940\n even though they abused their market power.\n\n1:42:42.940 --> 1:42:44.320\n And maybe I shouldn't give them credit\n\n1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:45.940\n for having the resources to hire talented people,\n\n1:42:45.940 --> 1:42:48.900\n but they did a credible job on IE4.\n\n1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:51.940\n What really was bad was that phase of the browser wars\n\n1:42:51.940 --> 1:42:56.100\n ended with monopoly and perhaps due to the antitrust case,\n\n1:42:56.100 --> 1:42:58.140\n perhaps due to regulation in Europe,\n\n1:42:59.340 --> 1:43:01.100\n perhaps just due to Microsoft not liking\n\n1:43:01.100 --> 1:43:05.420\n dealing with standardization, they let it rot.\n\n1:43:05.420 --> 1:43:10.420\n They just abandoned it, IE5, 5.5, IE6 later,\n\n1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.300\n but these were not well maintained.\n\n1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:14.420\n They had a lot of security bugs.\n\n1:43:14.420 --> 1:43:16.660\n It felt really closed and outdated too,\n\n1:43:16.660 --> 1:43:19.020\n even though it's getting updated, it's just weird.\n\n1:43:19.020 --> 1:43:22.100\n Browsers like Mozilla and then Firefox were adding tabs.\n\n1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:25.940\n Opera had a version of tabs and they didn't add tabs.\n\n1:43:25.940 --> 1:43:27.560\n And they pop up blocking,\n\n1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:28.860\n something I should have done from the start.\n\n1:43:28.860 --> 1:43:30.160\n People realized that you can tell\n\n1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:31.540\n when the user clicks something\n\n1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:34.300\n and it goes in JavaScript to open a little window,\n\n1:43:34.300 --> 1:43:36.220\n that you can sort of inspect the stack\n\n1:43:36.220 --> 1:43:38.140\n and see that the click originated that,\n\n1:43:38.140 --> 1:43:39.420\n and it's probably okay.\n\n1:43:39.420 --> 1:43:40.820\n Whereas if you're just loading a script\n\n1:43:40.820 --> 1:43:43.860\n and it opens a new window, that's a spam technique\n\n1:43:43.860 --> 1:43:45.220\n and you should block it.\n\n1:43:45.220 --> 1:43:47.380\n Tabs were a brilliant innovation.\n\n1:43:47.380 --> 1:43:48.380\n Like you said, Opera had it,\n\n1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:52.060\n but I remember I fully switched to Firefox the moment.\n\n1:43:52.060 --> 1:43:57.060\n I remember the moments of first using tabs in Firefox\n\n1:43:57.060 --> 1:44:00.220\n and not liking it for the first few minutes,\n\n1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:02.460\n and then like, wait a minute.\n\n1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:03.300\n You get the groove, yeah.\n\n1:44:03.300 --> 1:44:05.580\n You get the groove and you understand.\n\n1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:08.540\n So that timing, what year was this?\n\n1:44:08.540 --> 1:44:12.100\n Because also as a aspiring web designer,\n\n1:44:12.100 --> 1:44:16.260\n I use Table, so we didn't mention Layout or CSS much.\n\n1:44:16.260 --> 1:44:18.760\n There's also a change in the way\n\n1:44:18.760 --> 1:44:21.100\n the frames were going away.\n\n1:44:21.100 --> 1:44:23.620\n So there's a change in the way websites looked\n\n1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:25.300\n and behaved and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:44:25.300 --> 1:44:28.420\n CSS finally, which Microsoft embraced with IA4\n\n1:44:28.420 --> 1:44:30.700\n and Netscape never really did right.\n\n1:44:30.700 --> 1:44:33.440\n CSS became a better standard over time\n\n1:44:33.440 --> 1:44:36.140\n for doing Table Layout that relieved you\n\n1:44:36.140 --> 1:44:39.260\n of the need to use what are called spacer GIFs,\n\n1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:40.300\n spacer GIFs, right?\n\n1:44:40.300 --> 1:44:42.880\n Images, you would throw into space at tables.\n\n1:44:44.180 --> 1:44:47.460\n The typographic power of the web has gotten better,\n\n1:44:47.460 --> 1:44:49.320\n but it's still not on the level of PDF\n\n1:44:49.320 --> 1:44:51.580\n and you can't do advanced typography,\n\n1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:53.180\n but it's gotten really better.\n\n1:44:53.180 --> 1:44:54.920\n And even then, tables were getting better.\n\n1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:57.260\n If you were using Firefox, that would have been 2004\n\n1:44:57.260 --> 1:45:00.260\n because it was called Firebird until earlier that year.\n\n1:45:00.260 --> 1:45:01.860\n No, yeah, I think it wasn't.\n\n1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:02.700\n 2003.\n\n1:45:02.700 --> 1:45:06.100\n I don't remember, it was a Firebird, which had tabs?\n\n1:45:06.100 --> 1:45:07.060\n We had tabs the whole way.\n\n1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:10.420\n So it started out as Mozilla slash browser in 2002,\n\n1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:12.080\n became Phoenix.\n\n1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:14.700\n There's a BIOS that has an embedded version of IE\n\n1:45:14.700 --> 1:45:16.420\n and they said, we're called Phoenix Technologies,\n\n1:45:16.420 --> 1:45:17.620\n you can't use Phoenix.\n\n1:45:17.620 --> 1:45:19.180\n And so we said, okay, we'll call it Firebird.\n\n1:45:19.180 --> 1:45:21.220\n And then this Australian centered\n\n1:45:21.220 --> 1:45:24.900\n open source database project started really like\n\n1:45:24.900 --> 1:45:27.340\n in the true Mad Max style, just screaming at us saying,\n\n1:45:27.340 --> 1:45:28.380\n you can't use Firebird.\n\n1:45:28.380 --> 1:45:30.660\n And I had to sort of be the ambassador and say,\n\n1:45:30.660 --> 1:45:31.500\n okay, we're gonna rename.\n\n1:45:31.500 --> 1:45:32.340\n And they're like, we don't believe you,\n\n1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:33.700\n you shouldn't have used it, we hate you.\n\n1:45:33.700 --> 1:45:36.100\n And then we renamed it to Firefox.\n\n1:45:36.100 --> 1:45:38.060\n And they're like, ah, we love you.\n\n1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:40.140\n And then I haven't heard of them ever since.\n\n1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:41.780\n But Firefox was a clever name.\n\n1:45:41.780 --> 1:45:43.660\n We had to think of something distinctive.\n\n1:45:43.660 --> 1:45:45.740\n We wanted to keep the fire going.\n\n1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:48.180\n And it turns out there's a red panda, right?\n\n1:45:48.180 --> 1:45:49.460\n That's the nickname for it.\n\n1:45:49.460 --> 1:45:51.980\n So that's the second set of browser wars.\n\n1:45:51.980 --> 1:45:56.980\n So how was Firefox born, how was Mozilla born?\n\n1:45:59.660 --> 1:46:01.060\n There's a long story there too.\n\n1:46:01.060 --> 1:46:02.980\n So Netscape got acquired by AOL,\n\n1:46:02.980 --> 1:46:05.500\n which as I say was a reasonable happy ending\n\n1:46:05.500 --> 1:46:06.580\n for a lot of people,\n\n1:46:06.580 --> 1:46:08.500\n because Netscape otherwise was gonna go out of business\n\n1:46:08.500 --> 1:46:10.740\n because Microsoft was just killing its market.\n\n1:46:10.740 --> 1:46:12.540\n There was no way to charge for a browser.\n\n1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:15.980\n Windows came with IE, IE4 was pretty good\n\n1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:17.580\n and Netscape 4 wasn't that good.\n\n1:46:17.580 --> 1:46:19.060\n It took a while to get better.\n\n1:46:20.180 --> 1:46:22.340\n But the Netscape executive said,\n\n1:46:22.340 --> 1:46:25.660\n let's do an open source escape pod.\n\n1:46:25.660 --> 1:46:27.180\n And like in Star Wars, A New Hope,\n\n1:46:27.180 --> 1:46:28.340\n the gunner won't shoot it\n\n1:46:28.340 --> 1:46:30.180\n because there's no life forms on board, right?\n\n1:46:30.180 --> 1:46:31.460\n It's not a threat.\n\n1:46:31.460 --> 1:46:33.740\n And so we did Mozilla in 1998\n\n1:46:33.740 --> 1:46:37.980\n and it looked like it was going to initially\n\n1:46:37.980 --> 1:46:40.140\n just give the world an open source browser.\n\n1:46:40.140 --> 1:46:42.020\n But it's really hard to get people to work\n\n1:46:42.020 --> 1:46:43.900\n on this sort of hairball that had been hacked up\n\n1:46:43.900 --> 1:46:46.100\n over by that point four years.\n\n1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:49.140\n And it also couldn't have the crypto module\n\n1:46:49.140 --> 1:46:51.020\n for secure sockets, so called,\n\n1:46:51.020 --> 1:46:52.980\n or now transport layer security.\n\n1:46:52.980 --> 1:46:54.380\n That was an electronic munition.\n\n1:46:54.380 --> 1:46:56.100\n We were not allowed to release that\n\n1:46:56.100 --> 1:47:00.460\n in the full 1024 bit key strength.\n\n1:47:00.460 --> 1:47:05.100\n And yet people, one of whom I happened to meet previously\n\n1:47:05.100 --> 1:47:08.980\n at SGI when I went on a sales support engineering trip,\n\n1:47:08.980 --> 1:47:11.100\n Tim Hudson in Brisbane, Australia,\n\n1:47:11.100 --> 1:47:16.100\n and Eric A. Young did what became open SSL.\n\n1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:19.500\n It was called SSL EAY after Eric's initials.\n\n1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:23.180\n And Tim and Eric took their open SSL\n\n1:47:23.180 --> 1:47:25.420\n outside of the purview of the NSA\n\n1:47:25.420 --> 1:47:27.300\n and the Department of Commerce,\n\n1:47:27.300 --> 1:47:28.940\n and they stuck it into Mozilla's code.\n\n1:47:28.940 --> 1:47:31.060\n And that was perhaps the best hack that was done\n\n1:47:31.060 --> 1:47:34.540\n in the first few months after we open sourced the browser.\n\n1:47:34.540 --> 1:47:35.420\n We had other problems.\n\n1:47:35.420 --> 1:47:37.420\n The politics inside Netscape were riven\n\n1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:38.340\n by these acquisitions.\n\n1:47:38.340 --> 1:47:41.020\n So the one acquisition that kind of messed up Netscape\n\n1:47:41.020 --> 1:47:44.340\n for also wanted to keep doing a proprietary mail\n\n1:47:44.340 --> 1:47:48.860\n and groupware program, not Jamie Zawinski's mail program\n\n1:47:48.860 --> 1:47:50.180\n that was in Netscape two and three.\n\n1:47:50.180 --> 1:47:51.860\n And they held it back from open source.\n\n1:47:51.860 --> 1:47:54.320\n We didn't have a mail program, it was just a browser.\n\n1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:56.700\n We didn't know what AOL will do to us.\n\n1:47:56.700 --> 1:47:59.260\n Turns out they didn't interfere with us for a long time.\n\n1:47:59.260 --> 1:48:02.980\n But Netscape wasn't the best steward of Mozilla.\n\n1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:05.340\n We were operating Mozilla as a pirate ship\n\n1:48:05.340 --> 1:48:06.420\n without a legal entity.\n\n1:48:06.420 --> 1:48:08.900\n So most of us worked for Netscape\n\n1:48:08.900 --> 1:48:10.900\n under a separate organization.\n\n1:48:10.900 --> 1:48:15.400\n And initially the first engineering manager,\n\n1:48:15.400 --> 1:48:19.360\n Tom Paquin of Netscape was the Mozilla founding manager.\n\n1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:20.820\n But he left pretty quickly\n\n1:48:20.820 --> 1:48:23.120\n and he left me as the acting manager,\n\n1:48:23.120 --> 1:48:25.500\n which is more like method acting in my case.\n\n1:48:25.500 --> 1:48:28.780\n And that was my first management stint.\n\n1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:32.140\n But then someone who'd written the licenses,\n\n1:48:32.140 --> 1:48:34.100\n Mitchell Baker, she was a lawyer at Netscape.\n\n1:48:34.100 --> 1:48:38.180\n She was involved in the open source license decision making\n\n1:48:38.180 --> 1:48:40.380\n and the actual writing and construction of those licenses.\n\n1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:42.980\n That was Mitchell's job, Netscape public license\n\n1:48:42.980 --> 1:48:45.700\n and the truly open Mozilla public license.\n\n1:48:45.700 --> 1:48:47.380\n And there were two because Netscape needed,\n\n1:48:47.380 --> 1:48:49.580\n because of some encumbered code, needed some special rights\n\n1:48:49.580 --> 1:48:51.100\n but that went away over time.\n\n1:48:51.100 --> 1:48:52.820\n Mitchell was always interested in Mozilla\n\n1:48:52.820 --> 1:48:54.220\n and she came back from maternity leave\n\n1:48:54.220 --> 1:48:55.900\n and she said, I'll be the manager if you want.\n\n1:48:55.900 --> 1:48:57.420\n And Jamie and I said, sure.\n\n1:48:57.420 --> 1:48:59.380\n And then Jamie quit, he quit after a year.\n\n1:48:59.380 --> 1:49:01.640\n He said, this didn't work, I'm sorry.\n\n1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:04.340\n He acted like it was a total failure\n\n1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:08.100\n because Mozilla didn't restart the browser market.\n\n1:49:08.100 --> 1:49:09.260\n But there's no way it could have, right?\n\n1:49:09.260 --> 1:49:13.740\n Netscape was still shipping variants of Netscape 4,\n\n1:49:13.740 --> 1:49:15.700\n which was based on the old code.\n\n1:49:15.700 --> 1:49:18.360\n Mozilla was trying to react to the code\n\n1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:19.860\n to make greenfield for developers.\n\n1:49:19.860 --> 1:49:20.900\n So it was one of my big goals.\n\n1:49:20.900 --> 1:49:24.180\n It wasn't a technical goal so much as again, a social goal.\n\n1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:26.380\n People wanted a more standard spaced browser.\n\n1:49:26.380 --> 1:49:29.380\n They wanted less of a hairball that had been hacked on\n\n1:49:29.380 --> 1:49:32.020\n by ex grad students starting four years prior.\n\n1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:35.100\n So we said, we're gonna make a modular code base.\n\n1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:37.500\n We're gonna use a variant or an open source version\n\n1:49:37.500 --> 1:49:39.980\n of Microsoft's component object model,\n\n1:49:39.980 --> 1:49:43.420\n has reference counting and standardized V tables,\n\n1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:45.180\n virtual calls and C++.\n\n1:49:45.180 --> 1:49:47.300\n And we're gonna use JavaScript.\n\n1:49:47.300 --> 1:49:48.700\n We're gonna have a bridge between those two\n\n1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:50.140\n so you can script those components\n\n1:49:50.140 --> 1:49:51.560\n just like Java components.\n\n1:49:52.780 --> 1:49:54.800\n We're going to make a portable front end\n\n1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:57.220\n with a markup language for the user interface.\n\n1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:00.380\n Not tables, not HTML, but custom menus\n\n1:50:00.380 --> 1:50:02.880\n and dropdowns and toolbars.\n\n1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:06.060\n And that was called Zool, XML user interface language.\n\n1:50:06.060 --> 1:50:08.220\n And some real talent on the Netscape side delivered that.\n\n1:50:08.220 --> 1:50:11.320\n Dave Hyatt, who was instrumental in Zool,\n\n1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:15.700\n Chris Watterson, Joe Hewitt, Blake Ross.\n\n1:50:15.700 --> 1:50:17.820\n And Blake was an intern.\n\n1:50:17.820 --> 1:50:20.500\n He was like a high school aged intern at Netscape.\n\n1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:23.920\n And at some point we were innovating rapidly\n\n1:50:23.920 --> 1:50:26.960\n in the Mozilla world and Netscape was still caught up\n\n1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:29.340\n in this management mess from these acquisitions\n\n1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:30.420\n and it wasn't delivering.\n\n1:50:30.420 --> 1:50:32.800\n And every year they were wondering if ALO was gonna come\n\n1:50:32.800 --> 1:50:34.260\n and start beheading the executives\n\n1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:36.100\n because it didn't do anything useful.\n\n1:50:36.100 --> 1:50:36.940\n And there was this thought\n\n1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:38.940\n you should take the Netscape browser engine\n\n1:50:38.940 --> 1:50:40.740\n and put it in the Windows ALO client,\n\n1:50:40.740 --> 1:50:41.980\n which was the dial up client\n\n1:50:41.980 --> 1:50:45.420\n that all the increasingly aging users of ALO were using.\n\n1:50:45.420 --> 1:50:46.260\n Never happened.\n\n1:50:46.260 --> 1:50:48.140\n It would have been too big a change.\n\n1:50:48.140 --> 1:50:49.820\n So it wasn't clear why ALO bought Netscape,\n\n1:50:49.820 --> 1:50:50.940\n but as I said, they left it alone.\n\n1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:53.300\n But Netscape didn't leave Mozilla alone.\n\n1:50:53.300 --> 1:50:58.300\n And so in 2001, Mitchell called me up and said,\n\n1:50:58.780 --> 1:50:59.820\n I'm no longer employed.\n\n1:50:59.820 --> 1:51:00.660\n And I was like, what?\n\n1:51:00.660 --> 1:51:01.480\n You quit?\n\n1:51:01.480 --> 1:51:02.320\n No, no, this wasn't my choice.\n\n1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:05.300\n And there was a layoff which maybe accidentally\n\n1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:06.820\n or on purpose got rid of Mitchell.\n\n1:51:06.820 --> 1:51:08.660\n But the funny thing was we had an open source project.\n\n1:51:08.660 --> 1:51:11.220\n We had a lot of the engineers on staff on our side\n\n1:51:11.220 --> 1:51:15.220\n and we had people we'd hired through the Mozilla community\n\n1:51:15.220 --> 1:51:16.300\n who were top notch.\n\n1:51:16.300 --> 1:51:19.260\n They'd risen, they came in high quality, they knew the code\n\n1:51:19.260 --> 1:51:21.660\n and they actually were better than the average\n\n1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:23.340\n or median hire of Netscape.\n\n1:51:23.340 --> 1:51:26.940\n And so the funny thing was the executive\n\n1:51:26.940 --> 1:51:29.940\n who thought they'd gotten rid of Mitchell in the layoff\n\n1:51:29.940 --> 1:51:32.700\n on the next week's community call around Mozilla\n\n1:51:32.700 --> 1:51:35.220\n and what to do, there's Mitchell.\n\n1:51:35.220 --> 1:51:36.820\n And so this showed you can kind of transcend\n\n1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:40.420\n your boundaries of corporate open source\n\n1:51:40.420 --> 1:51:42.700\n if you get a project that has enough loyalty,\n\n1:51:42.700 --> 1:51:43.820\n even among the paid staff.\n\n1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:45.580\n Because we had outside people contributing.\n\n1:51:45.580 --> 1:51:47.980\n We had people at Red Hat and a few other places,\n\n1:51:47.980 --> 1:51:50.620\n but the majority of the hackers were employed by Netscape.\n\n1:51:50.620 --> 1:51:53.380\n But a lot of them at that point had come from the community\n\n1:51:53.380 --> 1:51:55.820\n and others got the community and wanted to work with it.\n\n1:51:55.820 --> 1:51:57.900\n And it was really the weakest engineers at Netscape\n\n1:51:57.900 --> 1:52:01.100\n who didn't like Mozilla and didn't like the crucible\n\n1:52:01.100 --> 1:52:04.220\n of competing with the better programmers.\n\n1:52:04.220 --> 1:52:06.640\n So if the project is good enough, it will rise,\n\n1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:08.220\n the Phoenix will rise out of the...\n\n1:52:08.220 --> 1:52:09.060\n That's exactly right.\n\n1:52:09.060 --> 1:52:10.880\n And so we had this Mozilla code base\n\n1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:11.720\n that was getting better.\n\n1:52:11.720 --> 1:52:13.540\n In fact, I think at some point in 2002\n\n1:52:13.540 --> 1:52:17.380\n when we declared Mozilla 1.0, I engineered a roadmap\n\n1:52:17.380 --> 1:52:20.100\n that successively through similar sort of six week,\n\n1:52:20.100 --> 1:52:23.000\n five week releases, like we all do with browser releases\n\n1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:26.460\n nowadays, Chrome does and Firefox braved us three weeks.\n\n1:52:26.460 --> 1:52:29.700\n We got to a point where we said, you know what?\n\n1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:30.540\n It doesn't suck.\n\n1:52:30.540 --> 1:52:33.240\n This is like the 1.0 that you want to release\n\n1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:35.340\n because if you hold it back any longer to polish it,\n\n1:52:35.340 --> 1:52:36.980\n you're denying others the ability to use it.\n\n1:52:36.980 --> 1:52:39.400\n It's like pro engineer, the mechanical CAD tool\n\n1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:43.660\n embedded the code, they embedded the layout engine.\n\n1:52:43.660 --> 1:52:46.980\n And Mozilla 1.0 was like a Netscape communication suite.\n\n1:52:46.980 --> 1:52:49.560\n We had at that point gotten male people\n\n1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:53.640\n to reintegrate mail and news and we had an editor for HTML.\n\n1:52:53.640 --> 1:52:56.620\n And it felt like a 90s suite, suiteware.\n\n1:52:57.620 --> 1:52:58.800\n And it felt kind of bloated.\n\n1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:02.140\n And the people who were taking that Mozilla open source\n\n1:53:02.140 --> 1:53:05.020\n and then adding Netscape flavor to it\n\n1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:06.540\n were not calling the shots right.\n\n1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:08.460\n And they were also under AOL's thumb a little bit\n\n1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:10.540\n and that they said, well, we should probably put\n\n1:53:10.540 --> 1:53:13.180\n the AOL instant messenger chicklet on the toolbar.\n\n1:53:13.180 --> 1:53:16.220\n We should put the ICQ, the other messaging system\n\n1:53:16.220 --> 1:53:17.340\n that AOL had acquired.\n\n1:53:17.340 --> 1:53:19.580\n We should put the ICQ button on the toolbar.\n\n1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:23.500\n And pretty soon Netscape looked like a bit of a NASCAR\n\n1:53:23.500 --> 1:53:24.900\n badged version of Mozilla.\n\n1:53:24.900 --> 1:53:27.180\n And that also made Mozilla more popular.\n\n1:53:27.180 --> 1:53:32.180\n And yet they had contrived to fire or lay off the leader\n\n1:53:35.460 --> 1:53:38.540\n and we carried on with an open source structure\n\n1:53:38.540 --> 1:53:40.860\n where Mozilla was still, you know, Mitchell was calling\n\n1:53:40.860 --> 1:53:44.480\n sort of management or project level shots\n\n1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:46.100\n and I was calling technical shots.\n\n1:53:46.100 --> 1:53:51.100\n And we had a popular suite, but we thought,\n\n1:53:51.200 --> 1:53:52.740\n why not make it just a browser?\n\n1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:55.380\n Because it'll be simpler, it'll do one job well.\n\n1:53:55.380 --> 1:53:58.780\n And even then we can strip it down by having extensions.\n\n1:53:58.780 --> 1:54:03.740\n So Dave Hyatt and Blake Ross, the high school aged intern\n\n1:54:03.740 --> 1:54:07.260\n did the first version, which was called Mozilla slash browser.\n\n1:54:07.260 --> 1:54:09.220\n It was very, the small group of us, Ian Hicks\n\n1:54:09.220 --> 1:54:14.220\n and Asa Dotzler, me and Joe Hewitt and Hyatt and Blake.\n\n1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:16.540\n And Hyatt was really the senior hacker.\n\n1:54:16.540 --> 1:54:20.500\n He'd done all these things like amazing cross platform menus\n\n1:54:20.500 --> 1:54:23.500\n through the user interface, markup language.\n\n1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:24.740\n And he knew how to do tab browsing.\n\n1:54:24.740 --> 1:54:28.260\n He'd implemented it natively on Mac OS at the time\n\n1:54:28.260 --> 1:54:31.740\n in Camino originally called Chimera.\n\n1:54:31.740 --> 1:54:34.300\n He'd written multiple implementations,\n\n1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:36.340\n which was a thing programmers should do.\n\n1:54:36.340 --> 1:54:38.440\n It's like the V8 team did for those missing years\n\n1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:40.980\n when the rest of the Chrome team's like, where's V8?\n\n1:54:41.980 --> 1:54:44.440\n In fact, Dave's wife, Rebecca told me a story\n\n1:54:44.440 --> 1:54:45.860\n about when they were at UIUC,\n\n1:54:45.860 --> 1:54:49.460\n they were also University of Illinois grad students.\n\n1:54:49.460 --> 1:54:51.300\n There was an assignment, it was a programming assignment\n\n1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:53.300\n it was supposed to do at the end of the semester.\n\n1:54:53.300 --> 1:54:56.820\n And Dave's friend was this, I'm gonna go think\n\n1:54:56.820 --> 1:54:59.460\n and I'm gonna design and I'm gonna make this\n\n1:54:59.460 --> 1:55:01.300\n platonic perfect form of the program.\n\n1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.580\n And then I'm gonna write it at the end when it's due.\n\n1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:05.140\n And Hyatt just went there and started hacking.\n\n1:55:05.140 --> 1:55:06.660\n He wrote one version, he wrote a second version,\n\n1:55:06.660 --> 1:55:09.220\n a third version, end of the semester comes around.\n\n1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:11.140\n The friend's not doing too well.\n\n1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:13.000\n It wasn't perfect and it wasn't written.\n\n1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:14.820\n I'm not sure how that story ended for him,\n\n1:55:14.820 --> 1:55:18.100\n but Dave's version was a fifth iteration, it was great.\n\n1:55:18.100 --> 1:55:20.700\n And so he'd done that with everything you need\n\n1:55:20.700 --> 1:55:21.700\n in a tabbed browser.\n\n1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:24.360\n And this really showed well in Phoenix,\n\n1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:28.120\n what we called Phoenix and I had to rename two more times.\n\n1:55:28.120 --> 1:55:32.260\n And Blake went to Stanford, he became a Stanford student\n\n1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:34.060\n and couldn't work on it.\n\n1:55:34.060 --> 1:55:36.620\n Dave Hyatt went to Apple in 2001.\n\n1:55:36.620 --> 1:55:39.580\n He was one of the founding Safari team members.\n\n1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:40.460\n Interesting, wow.\n\n1:55:40.460 --> 1:55:43.540\n But he was still blogging about tabbed browsing.\n\n1:55:43.540 --> 1:55:44.860\n I think Apple at some point said you should.\n\n1:55:44.860 --> 1:55:46.140\n Safari have tabbed browsing?\n\n1:55:46.140 --> 1:55:48.220\n Yeah, but it was because of Hyatt.\n\n1:55:48.220 --> 1:55:49.820\n Hyatt was quite a feather in their cap.\n\n1:55:49.820 --> 1:55:53.420\n Don Melton, who had been the engineering manager\n\n1:55:53.420 --> 1:55:56.540\n for Safari from the beginning, had been in Netscape also.\n\n1:55:56.540 --> 1:55:58.980\n And so there's this diaspora of talent\n\n1:55:58.980 --> 1:56:01.620\n and yet Hyatt was still kind of writing blog posts\n\n1:56:01.620 --> 1:56:03.260\n about how to do tabs right.\n\n1:56:03.260 --> 1:56:05.360\n And at some point Apple said, don't blog about that.\n\n1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:07.580\n That's our proprietary tab technology.\n\n1:56:07.580 --> 1:56:08.620\n And I was like, no, it's not.\n\n1:56:08.620 --> 1:56:10.580\n It was an opera and I've refined it.\n\n1:56:10.580 --> 1:56:15.420\n So we had to replace people and we had Ben Goodger,\n\n1:56:15.420 --> 1:56:18.020\n a New Zealander we hired at Netscape.\n\n1:56:18.020 --> 1:56:21.260\n And he stepped in to be the Firefox lead.\n\n1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:23.340\n And we also had this weird circumstance\n\n1:56:23.340 --> 1:56:26.900\n where AOL finally did notice that Netscape\n\n1:56:26.900 --> 1:56:28.380\n was kind of an albatross,\n\n1:56:28.380 --> 1:56:31.060\n that they bought it for no particular benefit.\n\n1:56:31.060 --> 1:56:33.820\n And even then the AOL politics were also heinous,\n\n1:56:33.820 --> 1:56:35.380\n sort of East Coast politics.\n\n1:56:35.380 --> 1:56:36.660\n I remember taking two trips there\n\n1:56:36.660 --> 1:56:37.820\n because I was a principal engineer.\n\n1:56:37.820 --> 1:56:39.560\n And so us principal engineers got trotted out\n\n1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.740\n to do dog and pony shows in Dallas, Virginia.\n\n1:56:42.740 --> 1:56:46.400\n And the AOL opera management was very East Coast in flavor.\n\n1:56:46.400 --> 1:56:49.100\n And they were at that time merging with Time Warner,\n\n1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:50.500\n which did not go well.\n\n1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:52.020\n So one of these years we went out there\n\n1:56:52.020 --> 1:56:53.420\n and we were all doing dog and pony shows\n\n1:56:53.420 --> 1:56:55.100\n and there were these characters\n\n1:56:55.100 --> 1:56:56.340\n that were sort of like marketing guys.\n\n1:56:56.340 --> 1:56:57.700\n One of them was wearing a cravat\n\n1:56:57.700 --> 1:56:59.460\n and one was named Reggie.\n\n1:56:59.460 --> 1:57:04.460\n And they were very you rather than non you.\n\n1:57:05.940 --> 1:57:07.480\n Or they were like what's what's Stoneman's\n\n1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:12.480\n metropolitan film, UHB, urban haute bourgeoisie.\n\n1:57:13.980 --> 1:57:15.820\n They were haute bourgeoisie.\n\n1:57:15.820 --> 1:57:19.100\n They were funny and they were kind of useless\n\n1:57:19.100 --> 1:57:20.140\n and kind of preppy.\n\n1:57:20.140 --> 1:57:21.460\n And then the next year we went back\n\n1:57:21.460 --> 1:57:22.340\n and I said, where's Reggie?\n\n1:57:22.340 --> 1:57:24.140\n And it's like, oh, Reggie's not here anymore\n\n1:57:24.140 --> 1:57:26.300\n because Time Warner realized that the merger\n\n1:57:26.300 --> 1:57:27.520\n wasn't in their interest either.\n\n1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:29.140\n And then the sort of knives came out.\n\n1:57:29.140 --> 1:57:31.820\n And these mergers rarely work, right?\n\n1:57:31.820 --> 1:57:32.680\n This is very difficult.\n\n1:57:32.680 --> 1:57:33.820\n You get these giant companies\n\n1:57:33.820 --> 1:57:35.300\n and they think there's gonna be synergy.\n\n1:57:35.300 --> 1:57:37.540\n That was the 90s, late 90s watch word.\n\n1:57:37.540 --> 1:57:39.340\n And there wasn't synergy with AOL buying Netscape\n\n1:57:39.340 --> 1:57:41.260\n and there wasn't synergy with Time Warner and AOL.\n\n1:57:41.260 --> 1:57:43.020\n But did AOL ever really work?\n\n1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:44.260\n Was it ever really cool?\n\n1:57:44.260 --> 1:57:46.460\n Like the same kind of fire and excitement\n\n1:57:46.460 --> 1:57:48.740\n that Firefox eventually created,\n\n1:57:48.740 --> 1:57:51.100\n was that ever there in AOL?\n\n1:57:51.100 --> 1:57:55.020\n AOL was the right time to do a dial up service\n\n1:57:55.020 --> 1:57:56.660\n that got distribution by basically\n\n1:57:56.660 --> 1:58:00.700\n leaflet bombing compact discs on the country.\n\n1:58:00.700 --> 1:58:04.420\n And they beat out CompuServe and the other ones,\n\n1:58:04.420 --> 1:58:06.860\n Prodigy, and then the web happened.\n\n1:58:06.860 --> 1:58:10.940\n And so you had almost like this isolated continent,\n\n1:58:10.940 --> 1:58:14.180\n like some of the evolutionary biologists I follow\n\n1:58:14.180 --> 1:58:19.180\n make fun of the funny large marsupial mammals of Australia,\n\n1:58:19.900 --> 1:58:21.500\n how silly they are.\n\n1:58:21.500 --> 1:58:23.100\n And so AOL is like Australia.\n\n1:58:23.100 --> 1:58:23.940\n Yeah.\n\n1:58:23.940 --> 1:58:26.420\n And you saw it over time because they kept aging\n\n1:58:26.420 --> 1:58:28.180\n and they were using AOL to get online\n\n1:58:28.180 --> 1:58:30.440\n and they couldn't really use a web browser.\n\n1:58:30.440 --> 1:58:33.380\n And it became sort of a valued cohort\n\n1:58:33.380 --> 1:58:35.140\n because they still have relatively high\n\n1:58:35.140 --> 1:58:37.200\n socioeconomic status and they have grandchildren,\n\n1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:39.500\n but it's going away, it's dying at some point.\n\n1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:42.100\n Towards the end of the aughts, that decade,\n\n1:58:42.100 --> 1:58:45.980\n and then to the decade 2010 plus,\n\n1:58:45.980 --> 1:58:48.620\n that Firefox became this incredible,\n\n1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:50.260\n I forget when Chrome came out, but.\n\n1:58:50.260 --> 1:58:51.100\n 2008, September.\n\n1:58:51.100 --> 1:58:55.060\n 2008, but Firefox was the sexy cool thing\n\n1:58:55.060 --> 1:58:57.500\n that represented a lot of the cutting edge technologies\n\n1:58:57.500 --> 1:58:58.340\n and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1:58:58.340 --> 1:59:00.140\n Web 2, it was amazing.\n\n1:59:00.140 --> 1:59:03.380\n Kim O'reilly and John Battelle did the first Web 2 conference\n\n1:59:03.380 --> 1:59:05.420\n which eventually became huge and they split it.\n\n1:59:05.420 --> 1:59:08.540\n But that was in 2004, it was right when Firefox was out.\n\n1:59:08.540 --> 1:59:11.640\n Craigslist was huge, it was killing classified revenue\n\n1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:14.420\n for newspapers, but there was just this ferment.\n\n1:59:14.420 --> 1:59:15.260\n People starting.\n\n1:59:15.260 --> 1:59:16.660\n Wikipedia along there somewhere.\n\n1:59:16.660 --> 1:59:19.820\n Gmail was already done and it was an impressive web mail.\n\n1:59:19.820 --> 1:59:21.140\n There were others before it like Hotmail,\n\n1:59:21.140 --> 1:59:22.860\n but Gmail was really impressive from Google.\n\n1:59:22.860 --> 1:59:26.020\n And Google Maps, people started seeing what could be done.\n\n1:59:26.020 --> 1:59:28.100\n They thought how can you drag the map around\n\n1:59:28.100 --> 1:59:29.700\n and how does that work?\n\n1:59:29.700 --> 1:59:32.460\n And it was all JavaScript and images and.\n\n1:59:32.460 --> 1:59:34.500\n So Gmail was 2003, four?\n\n1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:36.220\n Yeah, it actually started quite early.\n\n1:59:36.220 --> 1:59:37.340\n It might've been 2002 or three,\n\n1:59:37.340 --> 1:59:40.100\n but by the time we started dealing with Google and Firefox\n\n1:59:40.100 --> 1:59:41.040\n to get the search deal,\n\n1:59:41.040 --> 1:59:43.420\n which was the main revenue source for Mozilla,\n\n1:59:43.420 --> 1:59:47.740\n and still is, 2004, early, Sergey Brinz,\n\n1:59:47.740 --> 1:59:50.420\n one of his trusted engineer guys, Fritz Schneider,\n\n1:59:50.420 --> 1:59:53.380\n made contact with me at Mozilla and we started talking\n\n1:59:53.380 --> 1:59:56.980\n and we realized search and browser need each other.\n\n1:59:56.980 --> 1:59:58.460\n And this is deeply true, right?\n\n1:59:58.460 --> 1:59:59.780\n This is still true.\n\n1:59:59.780 --> 2:00:01.140\n This is why a lot of the search engines\n\n2:00:01.140 --> 2:00:02.240\n have their own browsers.\n\n2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:03.660\n Yeah, so in case people don't know,\n\n2:00:03.660 --> 2:00:05.580\n the main revenue source for the browser\n\n2:00:05.580 --> 2:00:07.240\n is the default search engine,\n\n2:00:07.240 --> 2:00:09.260\n which is kind of incredible to think about\n\n2:00:09.260 --> 2:00:11.460\n that that is a revenue source.\n\n2:00:11.460 --> 2:00:12.580\n It's a little bit sad.\n\n2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.580\n Yeah, it leads to this capture or kill effect\n\n2:00:14.580 --> 2:00:17.020\n where you have the search engine own its own browser\n\n2:00:17.020 --> 2:00:21.260\n and other browsers may struggle to get the distribution\n\n2:00:21.260 --> 2:00:22.620\n we talked about earlier.\n\n2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:26.800\n So where, and you said you've figured out\n\n2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:29.100\n that Google is working on its own browser\n\n2:00:29.100 --> 2:00:29.940\n at some point there.\n\n2:00:29.940 --> 2:00:30.780\n 2006, yeah.\n\n2:00:30.780 --> 2:00:33.220\n 2006, so would you say Firefox versus,\n\n2:00:33.220 --> 2:00:35.380\n was Internet Explorer part of the war here\n\n2:00:35.380 --> 2:00:37.300\n or was the Firefox versus Chrome?\n\n2:00:37.300 --> 2:00:40.900\n So Firefox didn't quite cause Microsoft to reconvene IE.\n\n2:00:40.900 --> 2:00:44.580\n They did do IE7 and I remember being on a plane\n\n2:00:44.580 --> 2:00:46.220\n back from the standards meeting,\n\n2:00:46.220 --> 2:00:48.980\n JavaScript standards meeting from Seattle, from Redmond,\n\n2:00:48.980 --> 2:00:52.100\n and there was some Microsoft guy in front of me.\n\n2:00:52.100 --> 2:00:54.940\n Turns out my wife knew him from her past life\n\n2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:58.200\n before we married and he was just this bearded big guy\n\n2:00:58.200 --> 2:00:59.040\n and he was like,\n\n2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:01.500\n we should have just killed Firefox in the cradle.\n\n2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:04.160\n All we needed to do was add pop up blocking in tabs\n\n2:01:04.160 --> 2:01:06.180\n and we could have made Internet Explorer kill Firefox.\n\n2:01:06.180 --> 2:01:07.820\n And it's like, shoulda, coulda, woulda, pal.\n\n2:01:07.820 --> 2:01:10.300\n And I was right behind him during this.\n\n2:01:10.300 --> 2:01:11.580\n But they didn't, they were slow\n\n2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:13.540\n and IE7 wasn't that great.\n\n2:01:13.540 --> 2:01:18.440\n And what really got them started I think was Chrome.\n\n2:01:18.440 --> 2:01:21.500\n And I talked to Larry Page in 2005,\n\n2:01:21.500 --> 2:01:24.500\n I think I said, we're talking about the Firefox relationship\n\n2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:26.120\n but he was also saying, what about WebKit?\n\n2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:31.120\n This was Apple's version of the old KHTML engine from Linux,\n\n2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:35.780\n the KDE side of Linux that was used in the Conqueror browser\n\n2:01:35.780 --> 2:01:38.140\n also with Ks that Apple had forked.\n\n2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:41.700\n And in 2005 was when Apple's principals\n\n2:01:41.700 --> 2:01:43.400\n including Dave Hyatt, Maciej Stokowiak,\n\n2:01:43.400 --> 2:01:45.580\n some of my friends who are still there said,\n\n2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:48.540\n we must stop patch bombing this poor KHTML project.\n\n2:01:48.540 --> 2:01:50.900\n We should make a proper Mozilla like organization,\n\n2:01:50.900 --> 2:01:51.780\n webkit.org.\n\n2:01:51.780 --> 2:01:53.700\n Now it wasn't a separate nonprofit or anything.\n\n2:01:53.700 --> 2:01:55.220\n It was still Apple, it was Apple controlled\n\n2:01:55.220 --> 2:01:58.180\n but they made their fork first class\n\n2:01:58.180 --> 2:02:00.500\n and they made it be something that they all worked in\n\n2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:01.340\n and lived in.\n\n2:02:01.340 --> 2:02:03.040\n And that was before Chrome.\n\n2:02:03.040 --> 2:02:05.660\n And then Chrome, Larry Page said, what about WebKit?\n\n2:02:05.660 --> 2:02:06.540\n I said, yeah, it's nice.\n\n2:02:06.540 --> 2:02:08.000\n I have friends who work on it.\n\n2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:09.560\n You might use that if you do your own browser.\n\n2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:10.460\n Why don't you do your own browser?\n\n2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:11.980\n Don't worry about Firefox.\n\n2:02:11.980 --> 2:02:12.940\n You should do your own browser.\n\n2:02:12.940 --> 2:02:15.260\n You can have your own opinion of how it should work.\n\n2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:17.060\n And sure enough they did.\n\n2:02:17.060 --> 2:02:19.180\n So by 2006, we knew they'd been working on it.\n\n2:02:19.180 --> 2:02:21.320\n Some of my friends who'd been at Netscape\n\n2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:22.420\n did the original demo.\n\n2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:24.020\n And the demo wasn't what you thought.\n\n2:02:24.020 --> 2:02:25.340\n It didn't have the fast JavaScript yet.\n\n2:02:25.340 --> 2:02:28.520\n That was still off in Denmark on a farm.\n\n2:02:29.540 --> 2:02:30.500\n Did it have tabs?\n\n2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:32.820\n It had tabs because all browsers had tabs at this point.\n\n2:02:32.820 --> 2:02:37.460\n And it had this software fault isolation I mentioned.\n\n2:02:37.460 --> 2:02:39.060\n It was through process isolation.\n\n2:02:39.060 --> 2:02:43.560\n So in theory, each tab has some operating system process.\n\n2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:45.580\n And so what's gonna take your tab down?\n\n2:02:45.580 --> 2:02:48.380\n Well, WebKit has bugs that can crash it\n\n2:02:48.380 --> 2:02:49.880\n but Flash was still big then.\n\n2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:51.220\n All the restaurant sites remember.\n\n2:02:51.220 --> 2:02:53.100\n And Flash crashed a lot.\n\n2:02:53.100 --> 2:02:55.020\n So the demo that I heard about,\n\n2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:57.980\n my friends at Netscape as a lot of people did,\n\n2:02:57.980 --> 2:03:00.460\n inside Google was the sad tab.\n\n2:03:00.460 --> 2:03:02.120\n They showed an early version of Chrome\n\n2:03:02.120 --> 2:03:04.200\n which is just this bare bones tab browser.\n\n2:03:04.200 --> 2:03:06.700\n They loaded a site with a known Flash volume\n\n2:03:06.700 --> 2:03:08.540\n and then suddenly Flash crashes.\n\n2:03:08.540 --> 2:03:10.860\n And everyone expected the whole browser to go down.\n\n2:03:10.860 --> 2:03:13.080\n But instead you got this little sad face in the tab\n\n2:03:13.080 --> 2:03:14.740\n and you could reload it and there it is again.\n\n2:03:14.740 --> 2:03:16.740\n So this was an improvement.\n\n2:03:16.740 --> 2:03:18.740\n It was a real move for security.\n\n2:03:18.740 --> 2:03:21.420\n It was based on a company they acquired\n\n2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:22.660\n called Green Border.\n\n2:03:22.660 --> 2:03:25.060\n They had some really big brains like Olfar Erlingsson\n\n2:03:25.060 --> 2:03:25.880\n I think was involved.\n\n2:03:25.880 --> 2:03:28.880\n And they had done some exotic security stuff\n\n2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:32.180\n but they ended up simplifying it to this process isolation.\n\n2:03:32.180 --> 2:03:34.960\n And it was good.\n\n2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:36.740\n And Firefox didn't have it at the time.\n\n2:03:36.740 --> 2:03:39.700\n So we were still struggling with security bugs.\n\n2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:42.980\n So we knew Chrome was coming\n\n2:03:42.980 --> 2:03:45.060\n but it took two more years to come out.\n\n2:03:45.060 --> 2:03:48.300\n And we were still getting the Google search revenue\n\n2:03:48.300 --> 2:03:51.860\n and we were still making Google the default engine\n\n2:03:51.860 --> 2:03:52.980\n and Firefox was still growing.\n\n2:03:52.980 --> 2:03:55.260\n Firefox grew I think until 2011.\n\n2:03:55.260 --> 2:03:56.900\n That was when it peaked.\n\n2:03:56.900 --> 2:03:59.900\n And as it started falling, it was because of Chrome.\n\n2:03:59.900 --> 2:04:02.900\n Chrome came out in 2008 and it had a comic book\n\n2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.820\n that leaked accidentally that showed some of the people\n\n2:04:04.820 --> 2:04:05.660\n who worked on it.\n\n2:04:05.660 --> 2:04:07.260\n Lars Bock was in there and so on.\n\n2:04:07.260 --> 2:04:08.980\n It was kind of soft launch\n\n2:04:08.980 --> 2:04:10.380\n because they didn't market it heavily.\n\n2:04:10.380 --> 2:04:12.580\n They didn't push distribution.\n\n2:04:12.580 --> 2:04:14.820\n But Google had reason to worry about distribution\n\n2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:19.220\n because Microsoft was doing a search engine, Bing,\n\n2:04:19.220 --> 2:04:20.500\n since 2007.\n\n2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:22.020\n In fact, when they came out with Bing,\n\n2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:25.220\n Google was worried that Microsoft would just brute force\n\n2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:28.540\n switch the default browser in everyone's Internet Explorer\n\n2:04:28.540 --> 2:04:32.580\n or even Firefox on Windows to Bing from Google.\n\n2:04:32.580 --> 2:04:34.860\n And Microsoft wasn't I think ready\n\n2:04:34.860 --> 2:04:37.100\n to dare the antitrust cops that way\n\n2:04:37.100 --> 2:04:39.020\n even though they'd gone to sleep.\n\n2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:42.020\n And I don't think Bing was ready either.\n\n2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:45.500\n But just in case it happened, Sundar Pichai,\n\n2:04:45.500 --> 2:04:47.740\n who rose very well based on this work,\n\n2:04:47.740 --> 2:04:50.580\n was sort of in charge of getting distribution deals.\n\n2:04:50.580 --> 2:04:52.180\n And he got Google toolbar\n\n2:04:52.180 --> 2:04:55.500\n and Google desktop search distribution.\n\n2:04:55.500 --> 2:04:56.780\n And if you remember those pieces of software,\n\n2:04:56.780 --> 2:04:59.460\n those were like desktop extensions,\n\n2:04:59.460 --> 2:05:01.940\n toolbars or operating system extensions\n\n2:05:01.940 --> 2:05:03.820\n for doing desktop search, searching your local files.\n\n2:05:03.820 --> 2:05:05.900\n Kind of like Mac OS Spotlight, right?\n\n2:05:05.900 --> 2:05:07.300\n Sadly, it died.\n\n2:05:07.300 --> 2:05:08.140\n It all died.\n\n2:05:08.140 --> 2:05:09.220\n And there were some features that we still missed\n\n2:05:09.220 --> 2:05:10.580\n that didn't make it into Chrome.\n\n2:05:10.580 --> 2:05:14.020\n But Sundar got OEMs to bundle those.\n\n2:05:14.020 --> 2:05:15.500\n And then he got enough of those deals\n\n2:05:15.500 --> 2:05:18.000\n that by 2007 or eight, Google felt,\n\n2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.500\n well, if Bing, Microsoft does the worst\n\n2:05:20.500 --> 2:05:21.860\n and tries to force Bing,\n\n2:05:21.860 --> 2:05:25.500\n we can reach in and reset it with that point of presence.\n\n2:05:25.500 --> 2:05:27.340\n So that was good for Sundar's career\n\n2:05:27.340 --> 2:05:28.180\n and it was good for Google,\n\n2:05:28.180 --> 2:05:30.780\n but it never came to pass that they had to defend.\n\n2:05:30.780 --> 2:05:32.940\n Microsoft was still slow.\n\n2:05:32.940 --> 2:05:35.000\n And by the time they saw Chrome come out,\n\n2:05:35.000 --> 2:05:37.420\n then they did what would have been IE9.\n\n2:05:37.420 --> 2:05:38.260\n And then they said,\n\n2:05:38.260 --> 2:05:39.500\n we're gonna have a fast JavaScript engine\n\n2:05:39.500 --> 2:05:41.380\n to Chakra, Chakra core.\n\n2:05:41.380 --> 2:05:43.140\n And they did okay.\n\n2:05:43.140 --> 2:05:46.220\n They were another process isolated,\n\n2:05:46.220 --> 2:05:48.980\n fast JavaScript browser, tab browser.\n\n2:05:48.980 --> 2:05:52.340\n So it sounds like there's a deep fundamental coupling\n\n2:05:52.340 --> 2:05:53.640\n of search engine and browser\n\n2:05:53.640 --> 2:05:55.780\n that's mixing this whole thing up.\n\n2:05:55.780 --> 2:05:59.980\n And obviously Firefox doesn't have a search engine.\n\n2:05:59.980 --> 2:06:03.680\n That's like, I mean, you're partnering with somebody\n\n2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:04.940\n with a search engine.\n\n2:06:04.940 --> 2:06:08.780\n With Yahoo or with Google or so on.\n\n2:06:08.780 --> 2:06:10.660\n They tried Yahoo, that was unfortunate\n\n2:06:10.660 --> 2:06:14.660\n because I think even though Marissa Mayer talked about it,\n\n2:06:14.660 --> 2:06:15.840\n she never pulled it off.\n\n2:06:15.840 --> 2:06:18.620\n They never restored the search team\n\n2:06:18.620 --> 2:06:19.600\n that had been laid off.\n\n2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:21.460\n I believe Carol Bartz was running Yahoo\n\n2:06:21.460 --> 2:06:23.100\n when Carol said, I've got to get rid\n\n2:06:23.100 --> 2:06:24.580\n of one of the three expensive things.\n\n2:06:24.580 --> 2:06:25.940\n I'm gonna get rid of search.\n\n2:06:25.940 --> 2:06:29.800\n And those researchers went to Google and Microsoft\n\n2:06:29.800 --> 2:06:32.500\n and there was no way to put Yahoo search back together.\n\n2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:36.020\n So when Firefox tried switching all their users\n\n2:06:36.020 --> 2:06:38.700\n who'd stuck with a default from Google to Yahoo,\n\n2:06:38.700 --> 2:06:40.980\n it was like mid December, 2014,\n\n2:06:40.980 --> 2:06:44.060\n a bunch of users said, what just happened to my Firefox?\n\n2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:45.300\n And others didn't notice right away,\n\n2:06:45.300 --> 2:06:46.220\n but over time they did.\n\n2:06:46.220 --> 2:06:48.320\n And so over the next year,\n\n2:06:48.320 --> 2:06:51.360\n the traffic just went away for Yahoo.\n\n2:06:51.360 --> 2:06:54.420\n And yet they were obliged, I understand it.\n\n2:06:54.420 --> 2:06:56.700\n I don't have inside knowledge, but this has leaked out\n\n2:06:56.700 --> 2:06:58.340\n and Danny Sullivan's written about it,\n\n2:06:58.340 --> 2:06:59.260\n search engine land.\n\n2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:01.520\n I think the deal was like fixed payments to Mozilla.\n\n2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:03.500\n So Mozilla was getting a bunch of money for traffic\n\n2:07:03.500 --> 2:07:04.960\n that wasn't staying because users\n\n2:07:04.960 --> 2:07:06.580\n were resetting their default.\n\n2:07:06.580 --> 2:07:09.220\n And this shows how defaults are important,\n\n2:07:09.220 --> 2:07:10.520\n but they have to be good enough\n\n2:07:10.520 --> 2:07:12.580\n that the user doesn't override them.\n\n2:07:12.580 --> 2:07:16.620\n And a lot of the commercial value in popular apps\n\n2:07:16.620 --> 2:07:18.040\n is what are the default settings?\n\n2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:20.120\n What is the default search?\n\n2:07:20.120 --> 2:07:21.860\n But oftentimes there's something just like you said,\n\n2:07:21.860 --> 2:07:25.020\n I mean, if there's something compelling\n\n2:07:25.020 --> 2:07:27.220\n that's also can beat out the default,\n\n2:07:27.220 --> 2:07:29.020\n like tab browsing and so on.\n\n2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:32.300\n And that's where, I mean, we'll talk about brave browser.\n\n2:07:32.300 --> 2:07:36.200\n It feels like now we're in this third stage\n\n2:07:36.200 --> 2:07:41.200\n where there's a Chrome, Firefox, Edge,\n\n2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:44.620\n I guess it's called and brave.\n\n2:07:44.620 --> 2:07:48.500\n And these are all seem like really exciting,\n\n2:07:48.500 --> 2:07:50.560\n I don't know, innovative browsers.\n\n2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.260\n They're all kind of copying off of each other,\n\n2:07:52.260 --> 2:07:53.760\n picking up the good stuff.\n\n2:07:53.760 --> 2:07:56.260\n There's evolution again, especially on tracking protection.\n\n2:07:56.260 --> 2:08:00.260\n So privacy is this sort of global wave that's rising.\n\n2:08:02.500 --> 2:08:04.820\n I like to call it a wave because it's a large,\n\n2:08:04.820 --> 2:08:07.020\n somewhat chaotic structure.\n\n2:08:07.020 --> 2:08:08.600\n It's not a unitary good.\n\n2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:11.780\n You can't say I'm buying privacy for $3,\n\n2:08:11.780 --> 2:08:12.740\n I'm paying $3 privacy.\n\n2:08:12.740 --> 2:08:14.300\n Some people think a VPN does this\n\n2:08:14.300 --> 2:08:15.980\n and are disappointed when it fails them.\n\n2:08:15.980 --> 2:08:19.700\n But often people use VPNs for region unlocking video\n\n2:08:19.700 --> 2:08:21.460\n or getting the US Netflix catalog.\n\n2:08:22.860 --> 2:08:25.380\n But privacy is not a unitary good, it's complex\n\n2:08:25.380 --> 2:08:28.060\n and people are understanding it only over time\n\n2:08:28.060 --> 2:08:30.700\n and as they get burned, but there's a genie\n\n2:08:30.700 --> 2:08:31.980\n that's not going back in the bottle there.\n\n2:08:31.980 --> 2:08:33.380\n People are fed up.\n\n2:08:33.380 --> 2:08:34.700\n Apple has responded to this.\n\n2:08:34.700 --> 2:08:36.620\n Apple was always making Safari, I think,\n\n2:08:36.620 --> 2:08:40.340\n more of a privacy branded browser from the very beginning.\n\n2:08:40.340 --> 2:08:42.300\n I think this was probably Steve Jobs.\n\n2:08:42.300 --> 2:08:45.260\n Safari had private windows, private tabs\n\n2:08:45.260 --> 2:08:48.220\n before Firefox did.\n\n2:08:48.220 --> 2:08:50.060\n And these are only private in the sense\n\n2:08:50.060 --> 2:08:53.020\n that they don't leave local traces,\n\n2:08:53.020 --> 2:08:53.980\n if you don't want them to.\n\n2:08:53.980 --> 2:08:57.180\n Turns out Safari does keep them around between shutdown.\n\n2:08:57.180 --> 2:08:59.860\n But the canonical model is no local traces\n\n2:08:59.860 --> 2:09:01.780\n after you close the private window.\n\n2:09:01.780 --> 2:09:04.900\n No leftover traces that you went to some site\n\n2:09:04.900 --> 2:09:06.140\n that you were embarrassed by\n\n2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:08.980\n or bought a gift for somebody you wanted to keep secret.\n\n2:09:10.220 --> 2:09:11.780\n But there's still some level of tracking.\n\n2:09:11.780 --> 2:09:14.860\n There's network tracking.\n\n2:09:14.860 --> 2:09:16.900\n Network privacy is not guaranteed at all\n\n2:09:16.900 --> 2:09:18.980\n because you're using the same internet and ISP\n\n2:09:18.980 --> 2:09:21.340\n as a public window, a non private window.\n\n2:09:21.340 --> 2:09:22.900\n But, Safari had that early on.\n\n2:09:22.900 --> 2:09:26.060\n They also had a cookie blocking policy\n\n2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:27.860\n that might take a little explaining.\n\n2:09:27.860 --> 2:09:29.820\n When you, if you know what a cookie is,\n\n2:09:29.820 --> 2:09:31.300\n it's a little bit of storage in the browser\n\n2:09:31.300 --> 2:09:33.420\n indexed by the name of the site.\n\n2:09:33.420 --> 2:09:35.060\n And it's really only the main name of the site,\n\n2:09:35.060 --> 2:09:40.060\n like bofa.com or, you know, something like npr.org.\n\n2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:45.980\n Every site can store some information in a cookie.\n\n2:09:45.980 --> 2:09:48.620\n Every time it's contacted by the browser,\n\n2:09:48.620 --> 2:09:50.860\n the previous version is sent back.\n\n2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:54.060\n And in the response from the server, the cookie's updated.\n\n2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:56.580\n So it's this little bit of storage in the browser\n\n2:09:56.580 --> 2:09:58.180\n that the site can keep updating\n\n2:09:58.180 --> 2:10:01.460\n and it can store an encrypted version\n\n2:10:01.460 --> 2:10:03.820\n of your login credentials with a timestamp\n\n2:10:03.820 --> 2:10:05.980\n so you can stay logged in\n\n2:10:05.980 --> 2:10:07.700\n without having to retype your password\n\n2:10:07.700 --> 2:10:08.820\n every time you navigate,\n\n2:10:08.820 --> 2:10:11.220\n which is how it would be if you didn't have cookies.\n\n2:10:11.220 --> 2:10:14.420\n The web protocols, especially in the 90s,\n\n2:10:14.420 --> 2:10:16.020\n are so called stateless protocols.\n\n2:10:16.020 --> 2:10:18.740\n So you go to your bank, you log in,\n\n2:10:18.740 --> 2:10:21.220\n you go from your login confirmed page\n\n2:10:21.220 --> 2:10:22.460\n to your account view.\n\n2:10:22.460 --> 2:10:24.980\n If you didn't have a cookie, you'd be logging in again.\n\n2:10:24.980 --> 2:10:26.580\n Every time you type in the source.\n\n2:10:26.580 --> 2:10:27.900\n So that was the great thing about cookies.\n\n2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:29.820\n Luhmann truly did it in a hurry in 1994\n\n2:10:29.820 --> 2:10:30.860\n before I joined Escape\n\n2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:34.860\n and he did it for really holding that kind of credential.\n\n2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:37.500\n But even then there was the image element\n\n2:10:37.500 --> 2:10:38.580\n embedded in the page\n\n2:10:38.580 --> 2:10:41.980\n and the image gets fetched possibly from a different server\n\n2:10:41.980 --> 2:10:44.220\n and that request carries the last cookie,\n\n2:10:44.220 --> 2:10:45.740\n which could be empty at first,\n\n2:10:45.740 --> 2:10:47.980\n and the response carries the updated cookie.\n\n2:10:47.980 --> 2:10:49.780\n So just by having images and cookies,\n\n2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:51.420\n you got tracking because that image server\n\n2:10:51.420 --> 2:10:54.220\n can be serving a little one by one pixel\n\n2:10:54.220 --> 2:10:56.500\n and they still use the word pixel in ad tech.\n\n2:10:56.500 --> 2:10:59.380\n And that pixel can be served from the same server,\n\n2:10:59.380 --> 2:11:02.140\n embedded differently with different URL spellings\n\n2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:03.740\n in the New York Times and ESPN.\n\n2:11:03.740 --> 2:11:05.860\n And as you go from one to the other,\n\n2:11:05.860 --> 2:11:06.980\n the image server can say,\n\n2:11:06.980 --> 2:11:08.180\n I haven't got a cookie for you.\n\n2:11:08.180 --> 2:11:09.020\n It's empty initially.\n\n2:11:09.020 --> 2:11:11.260\n I'm gonna assign you user number 1234.\n\n2:11:11.260 --> 2:11:13.020\n I'm gonna put a database entry in.\n\n2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:13.860\n And I see, by the way,\n\n2:11:13.860 --> 2:11:15.980\n I always fetch the name of the path part of the URL\n\n2:11:15.980 --> 2:11:17.460\n that I was in the New York Times.\n\n2:11:17.460 --> 2:11:18.980\n So you're a New York Times reader.\n\n2:11:18.980 --> 2:11:20.980\n And then you hit ESPN, same thing.\n\n2:11:20.980 --> 2:11:22.260\n And the database gets updated\n\n2:11:22.260 --> 2:11:25.580\n and the number user 1234 indexes in the database\n\n2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:28.140\n to a profile of you, you've been tracked.\n\n2:11:28.140 --> 2:11:29.420\n This was not intended.\n\n2:11:29.420 --> 2:11:32.740\n And it was too late to undo by the time I got the Netscape.\n\n2:11:32.740 --> 2:11:35.100\n I think Lou wanted to do Twinkies, he called them.\n\n2:11:35.100 --> 2:11:37.380\n And he was trying to solve several problems.\n\n2:11:37.380 --> 2:11:38.380\n He wanted them to be bigger\n\n2:11:38.380 --> 2:11:40.540\n because initially cookies had a short size limit.\n\n2:11:40.540 --> 2:11:42.340\n I think he wanted to solve the third party problem,\n\n2:11:42.340 --> 2:11:45.100\n but Tom Paquin, the engineering manager said,\n\n2:11:45.100 --> 2:11:47.180\n nope, no Twinkies, just cookies.\n\n2:11:47.180 --> 2:11:48.100\n We're done.\n\n2:11:48.100 --> 2:11:49.060\n You're done, son.\n\n2:11:49.060 --> 2:11:51.540\n And that's how a lot of that stuff was.\n\n2:11:51.540 --> 2:11:54.620\n That's how JavaScript got frozen\n\n2:11:54.620 --> 2:11:55.860\n like a flying Amber in some ways\n\n2:11:55.860 --> 2:11:57.900\n with that sloppy equality operator that I made\n\n2:11:57.900 --> 2:11:58.980\n because of the early adopters.\n\n2:11:58.980 --> 2:12:01.900\n And the cookie got stuck with this tracking hazard.\n\n2:12:01.900 --> 2:12:04.300\n And then because JavaScripts can be like images,\n\n2:12:04.300 --> 2:12:05.940\n they're embedded in the page.\n\n2:12:05.940 --> 2:12:08.660\n By the time Netscape 3, I made that work.\n\n2:12:08.660 --> 2:12:10.820\n You can get a request with the last cookie value\n\n2:12:10.820 --> 2:12:11.940\n and the response updates it.\n\n2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:12.940\n That's a tracking mechanism.\n\n2:12:12.940 --> 2:12:14.940\n And that's why you don't even need images to track.\n\n2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:16.460\n Now you just use scripts.\n\n2:12:16.460 --> 2:12:20.020\n So this whole tracking economy evolved\n\n2:12:20.020 --> 2:12:23.860\n and it depended on these accidents of the 90s,\n\n2:12:23.860 --> 2:12:25.300\n these unintended consequences.\n\n2:12:25.300 --> 2:12:27.200\n Well, it created some of the richest companies\n\n2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:28.040\n in the world, right?\n\n2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:28.860\n I mean, it's the social media.\n\n2:12:28.860 --> 2:12:29.980\n All I got was T shirts.\n\n2:12:29.980 --> 2:12:33.180\n All I got is this crappy T shirt.\n\n2:12:33.180 --> 2:12:34.100\n Yeah.\n\n2:12:34.100 --> 2:12:38.420\n I mean, so that's the fundamental problem\n\n2:12:38.420 --> 2:12:39.500\n the world is facing now.\n\n2:12:39.500 --> 2:12:42.020\n They're looking at what social media has created\n\n2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:44.180\n and they're looking at,\n\n2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:47.020\n and like a world is looking at itself in the mirror\n\n2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:50.980\n and seeing that privacy is actually something\n\n2:12:50.980 --> 2:12:53.540\n as opposed to like a nice thing to have.\n\n2:12:53.540 --> 2:12:57.260\n It's something that is actually should be fundamental\n\n2:12:57.260 --> 2:12:59.220\n to the way we interact with the world\n\n2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:00.600\n as part of our tooling.\n\n2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:03.540\n And that's where the Brave browser comes in.\n\n2:13:03.540 --> 2:13:06.060\n And I suppose others as well are playing with this idea,\n\n2:13:06.060 --> 2:13:07.660\n but Brave is at the forefront of that.\n\n2:13:07.660 --> 2:13:11.020\n So maybe can you like describe what Brave is\n\n2:13:11.020 --> 2:13:14.700\n and what are its key principles and what's broken\n\n2:13:14.700 --> 2:13:16.140\n and what is it Brave trying to fix?\n\n2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:18.380\n So when I realized that these accidents\n\n2:13:18.380 --> 2:13:19.900\n like the third party cookie,\n\n2:13:19.900 --> 2:13:21.840\n the image or script that's tracking you\n\n2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:26.020\n or the JavaScripts that can do an invisibly now,\n\n2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:28.700\n that all this stuff wasn't intended\n\n2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:31.660\n and that Firefox had supported extensions\n\n2:13:31.660 --> 2:13:32.640\n that block some of these things,\n\n2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:34.740\n I thought probably we should have browsers\n\n2:13:34.740 --> 2:13:37.440\n just block some of these things by default.\n\n2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:39.780\n These were not intended and they're now unsafe.\n\n2:13:39.780 --> 2:13:40.620\n They're tracking you.\n\n2:13:40.620 --> 2:13:43.460\n There could be data breaches, malware distribution,\n\n2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:48.420\n bullying and psyops and other attacks on people.\n\n2:13:49.660 --> 2:13:51.500\n Block that stuff, block that JavaScript.\n\n2:13:51.500 --> 2:13:54.700\n I'm Dr. Frankenstein, I've got to deal with a monster here.\n\n2:13:54.700 --> 2:13:56.540\n But obviously you go to Gmail,\n\n2:13:56.540 --> 2:13:57.540\n there's a bunch of script there\n\n2:13:57.540 --> 2:13:59.320\n to make that amazing web client.\n\n2:13:59.320 --> 2:14:02.180\n That's okay, that's first party JavaScript.\n\n2:14:02.180 --> 2:14:04.020\n So how do you tell the first from the third party?\n\n2:14:04.020 --> 2:14:04.860\n And it's not easy.\n\n2:14:04.860 --> 2:14:06.700\n It's not a matter of just what's embedded\n\n2:14:06.700 --> 2:14:09.860\n from a different server because a lot of publishers\n\n2:14:09.860 --> 2:14:12.980\n use benign scripts from unrelated domains\n\n2:14:12.980 --> 2:14:14.360\n or apparently unrelated domains.\n\n2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:16.660\n So you end up having to develop a sort of human\n\n2:14:16.660 --> 2:14:19.700\n and machine learning practice around blocking.\n\n2:14:19.700 --> 2:14:22.300\n And at Brave, we did that from the start\n\n2:14:22.300 --> 2:14:25.740\n and built a research team to help drive it and automate it.\n\n2:14:25.740 --> 2:14:28.900\n We realized that protecting people needed machine learning\n\n2:14:28.900 --> 2:14:30.420\n and around 2017 spring,\n\n2:14:30.420 --> 2:14:32.680\n I talked to my friends at Apple about this too\n\n2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:34.060\n and they were also doing\n\n2:14:34.060 --> 2:14:36.640\n what they call intelligent tracking prevention,\n\n2:14:36.640 --> 2:14:39.320\n which uses local machine learning in the browser.\n\n2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:42.880\n And the funny thing is, great minds think alike,\n\n2:14:42.880 --> 2:14:44.780\n they were taking their third party cookie blocker\n\n2:14:44.780 --> 2:14:46.460\n that was in Safari from the old days\n\n2:14:46.460 --> 2:14:48.540\n and making it not have a big loophole.\n\n2:14:48.540 --> 2:14:51.740\n Because what they did was in 2003, when Safari came out,\n\n2:14:51.740 --> 2:14:53.740\n they said, we're gonna block cookies\n\n2:14:53.740 --> 2:14:57.220\n that are from those third party embedded elements\n\n2:14:57.220 --> 2:14:59.120\n where you've never visited that site before.\n\n2:14:59.120 --> 2:15:02.340\n So I'm gonna pick an ad company that got sold to AT&T,\n\n2:15:02.340 --> 2:15:05.140\n so I'm not picking on anybody unfairly, appnexus.com.\n\n2:15:05.140 --> 2:15:06.660\n Have you ever been to appnexus.com?\n\n2:15:06.660 --> 2:15:07.500\n Nope.\n\n2:15:07.500 --> 2:15:09.020\n I've never been there, but I guarantee you 10 years ago,\n\n2:15:09.020 --> 2:15:11.180\n you probably had, if you were using Firefox,\n\n2:15:11.180 --> 2:15:13.020\n you had a cookie, third party cookie,\n\n2:15:13.020 --> 2:15:14.980\n because you were being tracked by them\n\n2:15:14.980 --> 2:15:15.920\n and they were using that cookie\n\n2:15:15.920 --> 2:15:17.560\n to build up a profile of you.\n\n2:15:17.560 --> 2:15:20.700\n In Safari, as long as the user never went to appnexus,\n\n2:15:20.700 --> 2:15:22.380\n that cookie would not be set.\n\n2:15:22.380 --> 2:15:25.460\n And that was a real move for privacy early on\n\n2:15:25.460 --> 2:15:27.660\n when jobs were still around in Safari.\n\n2:15:27.660 --> 2:15:30.620\n But it had this loophole that if you do go to appnexus,\n\n2:15:30.620 --> 2:15:32.540\n then why it's okay to be a third party cookie.\n\n2:15:32.540 --> 2:15:35.180\n And so appnexus did something very naughty.\n\n2:15:35.180 --> 2:15:36.820\n They took their ad partners\n\n2:15:36.820 --> 2:15:39.000\n to put the actual ad you click on.\n\n2:15:39.000 --> 2:15:40.300\n And they said, hey, add a little script\n\n2:15:40.300 --> 2:15:42.620\n so that when somebody clicks on the ad,\n\n2:15:42.620 --> 2:15:44.500\n before it goes to your landing page,\n\n2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:46.340\n redirect to appnexus and we'll redirect\n\n2:15:46.340 --> 2:15:47.180\n to the landing page.\n\n2:15:47.180 --> 2:15:49.140\n And by doing that, they set a first party cookie\n\n2:15:49.140 --> 2:15:49.980\n and they got whitelisted.\n\n2:15:49.980 --> 2:15:51.660\n So it was a loophole they exploited.\n\n2:15:51.660 --> 2:15:53.580\n Intelligent tracking prevention in Safari\n\n2:15:53.580 --> 2:15:56.620\n was sophisticated enough to counteract this\n\n2:15:56.620 --> 2:15:59.100\n and it did other things and it's evolved since they did it.\n\n2:15:59.100 --> 2:16:00.720\n And we've evolved brave too.\n\n2:16:00.720 --> 2:16:02.560\n And so when I say machine and human learning,\n\n2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:05.580\n there's a real set of techniques here.\n\n2:16:05.580 --> 2:16:06.420\n They have to fight.\n\n2:16:06.420 --> 2:16:07.580\n This is a fascinating problem.\n\n2:16:07.580 --> 2:16:08.400\n Fingerprinting, right?\n\n2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:10.720\n Anytime you have a little bit of storage in the browser\n\n2:16:10.720 --> 2:16:13.580\n associated with a website,\n\n2:16:13.580 --> 2:16:15.540\n if the bad guy can get 32 websites,\n\n2:16:15.540 --> 2:16:17.660\n each one has a bit of storage, that's 32 bits.\n\n2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:19.820\n You can turn the bit on or off,\n\n2:16:19.820 --> 2:16:21.280\n you can make 4 billion numbers,\n\n2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:22.260\n you can make an identifier.\n\n2:16:22.260 --> 2:16:24.660\n It's called a super cookie sometimes.\n\n2:16:26.660 --> 2:16:28.880\n There are weaker ways that are statistical.\n\n2:16:28.880 --> 2:16:29.780\n They're called fingerprinting.\n\n2:16:29.780 --> 2:16:30.780\n You have to block all of them\n\n2:16:30.780 --> 2:16:32.840\n and you have to not only automate,\n\n2:16:32.840 --> 2:16:34.940\n you want to work in the web standards body\n\n2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:38.480\n to put privacy in by default, by design,\n\n2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:40.500\n from the get go, not add it as an afterthought\n\n2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:43.180\n or go hogwile with new web APIs\n\n2:16:43.180 --> 2:16:47.500\n to add a bunch more local storage or fingerprint surface area.\n\n2:16:47.500 --> 2:16:48.660\n And that's been a struggle too,\n\n2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:50.940\n because guess who's the new Microsoft\n\n2:16:50.940 --> 2:16:51.780\n in the standards body?\n\n2:16:51.780 --> 2:16:52.700\n It's Google.\n\n2:16:52.700 --> 2:16:55.900\n And they're not in favor of privacy first.\n\n2:16:55.900 --> 2:16:58.740\n They want to do privacy their way,\n\n2:16:58.740 --> 2:17:01.180\n only under, I would say, market pressure.\n\n2:17:01.180 --> 2:17:03.660\n But with Apple and with Brave leading the way,\n\n2:17:03.660 --> 2:17:06.280\n we block third party cookies almost without exception.\n\n2:17:06.280 --> 2:17:07.940\n So we've just blocked them.\n\n2:17:07.940 --> 2:17:11.540\n And that gives us a very strong privacy benefit,\n\n2:17:11.540 --> 2:17:13.740\n but it also means some sites just don't work right.\n\n2:17:13.740 --> 2:17:15.500\n Embedded YouTube videos might not work right.\n\n2:17:15.500 --> 2:17:19.620\n So we're adapting in a similar way to Apple's done with ITP\n\n2:17:19.620 --> 2:17:22.740\n to make third party cookies blocked,\n\n2:17:22.740 --> 2:17:26.460\n but to sort of simulate what looks like\n\n2:17:26.460 --> 2:17:28.860\n a working third party cookie for the site.\n\n2:17:28.860 --> 2:17:32.320\n It essentially tries to partition each site\n\n2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:34.860\n and its third parties into its own sort of cookie jar.\n\n2:17:34.860 --> 2:17:35.700\n Got it.\n\n2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:37.060\n And so, like you said,\n\n2:17:37.060 --> 2:17:41.100\n is this both like a human fine tuning issue\n\n2:17:41.100 --> 2:17:42.580\n and a machine learning problem?\n\n2:17:42.580 --> 2:17:44.540\n And as the humans learn,\n\n2:17:44.540 --> 2:17:46.380\n then they train the machine learning.\n\n2:17:46.380 --> 2:17:50.580\n But, you know, maybe Google aside or including Google,\n\n2:17:50.580 --> 2:17:53.220\n there's millions of dollars, if not B,\n\n2:17:53.220 --> 2:17:54.900\n billions of dollars to be made\n\n2:17:54.900 --> 2:17:57.860\n from fighting the ways of Brave.\n\n2:17:57.860 --> 2:17:58.700\n That's right.\n\n2:17:58.700 --> 2:18:00.660\n And it's been an interesting change\n\n2:18:00.660 --> 2:18:01.980\n from when we started in 2015.\n\n2:18:01.980 --> 2:18:04.420\n When we started, you know, ad blocking extensions,\n\n2:18:04.420 --> 2:18:06.140\n ad block plus was one of the big ones\n\n2:18:06.140 --> 2:18:08.660\n that started on Firefox in 2006, I believe,\n\n2:18:08.660 --> 2:18:11.020\n had gotten to a certain level of use around the world.\n\n2:18:11.020 --> 2:18:14.380\n And browsers like UC Web, UC Browser in Asia\n\n2:18:14.380 --> 2:18:17.300\n had some amount of ad blocking built in and on by default.\n\n2:18:17.300 --> 2:18:19.300\n So, a page fair was a startup\n\n2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:23.580\n and they measured ad blocking adoption.\n\n2:18:23.580 --> 2:18:24.420\n And they tried to say,\n\n2:18:24.420 --> 2:18:26.580\n hey publishers, you're, you know,\n\n2:18:26.580 --> 2:18:30.200\n 30% of the visitors to Pitchfork or Wire\n\n2:18:30.200 --> 2:18:32.900\n to Conda NAS properties are using ad blockers.\n\n2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.380\n If we can somehow convince them\n\n2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:37.340\n to lower their ad blocking for your site,\n\n2:18:37.340 --> 2:18:39.300\n that could be like a 43% lift, right?\n\n2:18:39.300 --> 2:18:42.020\n And, you know, three sevenths.\n\n2:18:42.020 --> 2:18:44.260\n Well, that's easier said than done.\n\n2:18:44.260 --> 2:18:46.140\n And PageFair and others, SourcePoint,\n\n2:18:46.140 --> 2:18:48.060\n and many others tried to either smuggle ads through\n\n2:18:48.060 --> 2:18:52.260\n or cajole the user into letting, you know, ads appear.\n\n2:18:52.260 --> 2:18:53.100\n And it didn't really work.\n\n2:18:53.100 --> 2:18:54.460\n And meanwhile, the ad blocking adoption\n\n2:18:54.460 --> 2:18:56.860\n has just continued intelligent tracking prevention\n\n2:18:56.860 --> 2:19:01.620\n in Safari in 2017, Brave from 2016 on\n\n2:19:01.620 --> 2:19:04.460\n with very strong cookie blocking and other protections.\n\n2:19:04.460 --> 2:19:06.660\n And this is not going away.\n\n2:19:06.660 --> 2:19:08.500\n The publishers used to rage against it.\n\n2:19:08.500 --> 2:19:10.460\n Like we would try to say, we can help you.\n\n2:19:10.460 --> 2:19:11.960\n You're dealing with users\n\n2:19:11.960 --> 2:19:14.100\n who are already blocking all your ads.\n\n2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:16.800\n We can try to put back some economics\n\n2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:18.460\n that help the user and you\n\n2:19:18.460 --> 2:19:19.980\n that led to the basic attention token\n\n2:19:19.980 --> 2:19:21.460\n that we started with Bitcoin.\n\n2:19:21.460 --> 2:19:22.460\n We can be your friend.\n\n2:19:22.460 --> 2:19:24.980\n Don't just fingerprint us as an ad blocker\n\n2:19:24.980 --> 2:19:26.480\n and treat us as an enemy.\n\n2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:28.620\n But in 2015 or 16, it was like,\n\n2:19:28.620 --> 2:19:29.540\n nah, you're an ad blocker.\n\n2:19:29.540 --> 2:19:30.380\n Get out of here.\n\n2:19:30.380 --> 2:19:31.200\n I hate you.\n\n2:19:31.200 --> 2:19:33.740\n And by 2017 or 18, it's like something's happening.\n\n2:19:33.740 --> 2:19:34.940\n The ad blocking is not stopping\n\n2:19:34.940 --> 2:19:37.020\n and we're all getting sort of pulled\n\n2:19:37.020 --> 2:19:41.580\n on the Google's plantation through AMP, AMP.\n\n2:19:41.580 --> 2:19:44.580\n Or we're getting killed by the Google ad system we use\n\n2:19:44.580 --> 2:19:46.620\n because it's taking all the revenue\n\n2:19:46.620 --> 2:19:49.140\n or it's permitting or some other vendors we use\n\n2:19:49.140 --> 2:19:50.140\n are permitting ad fraud.\n\n2:19:50.140 --> 2:19:52.640\n And so a fake New York Times is getting paid\n\n2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:57.140\n by the marketer running an ad that a bot clicks on.\n\n2:19:57.140 --> 2:19:58.240\n And the real New York Times\n\n2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:00.500\n that's supposed to get the ad doesn't get it.\n\n2:20:00.500 --> 2:20:01.540\n And there's something really broken\n\n2:20:01.540 --> 2:20:02.460\n about that kind of system.\n\n2:20:02.460 --> 2:20:06.700\n And that fraud is mediated through Google's ad exchange,\n\n2:20:06.700 --> 2:20:07.860\n which is the biggest of them all.\n\n2:20:07.860 --> 2:20:09.660\n And Google takes a fee.\n\n2:20:09.660 --> 2:20:10.700\n There's a flip side of that,\n\n2:20:10.700 --> 2:20:12.660\n which is malware distribution, malvertising,\n\n2:20:12.660 --> 2:20:16.300\n where fake advertisers put malware payloads\n\n2:20:16.300 --> 2:20:19.340\n in or exploit hit loaders in JavaScript\n\n2:20:19.340 --> 2:20:22.460\n and they smuggle them in ads onto real publisher pages,\n\n2:20:22.460 --> 2:20:24.460\n the ad exchange takes the fee.\n\n2:20:24.460 --> 2:20:25.580\n Now, I'm not a lawyer.\n\n2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:27.100\n I'm not gonna say this is a RICO predicate,\n\n2:20:27.100 --> 2:20:30.220\n but why is the ad exchange facilitating fraud\n\n2:20:30.220 --> 2:20:32.060\n and malware distribution and taking a fee?\n\n2:20:32.060 --> 2:20:32.880\n It's not right.\n\n2:20:32.880 --> 2:20:33.940\n As opposed to just fighting,\n\n2:20:33.940 --> 2:20:35.660\n this is the really interesting thing about Brave\n\n2:20:35.660 --> 2:20:37.700\n is as opposed to just fighting\n\n2:20:37.700 --> 2:20:39.980\n and then being treated like an ad blocker,\n\n2:20:39.980 --> 2:20:42.060\n you're providing an alternate.\n\n2:20:42.060 --> 2:20:45.460\n There's a philosophical idea here\n\n2:20:45.460 --> 2:20:47.500\n that might change the nature of the internet\n\n2:20:47.500 --> 2:20:49.220\n with the basic attention token.\n\n2:20:49.220 --> 2:20:50.060\n Yes.\n\n2:20:50.060 --> 2:20:54.060\n Well, maybe what is basic attention token BAT\n\n2:20:54.060 --> 2:20:55.300\n and how does it work?\n\n2:20:55.300 --> 2:20:58.200\n Okay, I'll tell the story first by saying how I came to it.\n\n2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:00.820\n I realized for a long time at Firefox,\n\n2:21:00.820 --> 2:21:02.940\n we were dependent on this Google search deal.\n\n2:21:02.940 --> 2:21:05.700\n And I thought, now that Chrome's out,\n\n2:21:05.700 --> 2:21:07.260\n maybe that's gonna go away.\n\n2:21:07.260 --> 2:21:10.740\n And they just, at some point, Google will say,\n\n2:21:10.740 --> 2:21:14.620\n Firefox, like old yeller, you saved me from the rabid beast,\n\n2:21:14.620 --> 2:21:16.360\n now I have to shoot you in the head.\n\n2:21:16.360 --> 2:21:19.660\n Done your job, sad but true, goodbye.\n\n2:21:19.660 --> 2:21:21.780\n And what could we do?\n\n2:21:21.780 --> 2:21:24.140\n And I think Mozilla doesn't know what to do.\n\n2:21:24.140 --> 2:21:25.900\n This is something that I couldn't solve there\n\n2:21:25.900 --> 2:21:27.220\n and I don't think they can solve.\n\n2:21:27.220 --> 2:21:29.460\n But I thought, why is the browser\n\n2:21:29.460 --> 2:21:32.300\n the sort of passive servant of these big tech companies?\n\n2:21:32.300 --> 2:21:36.420\n Why is it a blind runtime for ad tech JavaScripts,\n\n2:21:36.420 --> 2:21:38.100\n including from Google?\n\n2:21:38.100 --> 2:21:39.220\n Why doesn't it block some?\n\n2:21:39.220 --> 2:21:43.940\n And if it blocks some, why can't it reconnect users,\n\n2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:47.520\n readers, fans with publishers, creators, websites?\n\n2:21:48.480 --> 2:21:51.220\n Why can't it help people make direct payments\n\n2:21:51.220 --> 2:21:54.900\n or even possibly get an ad revenue share for private ads\n\n2:21:54.900 --> 2:21:56.300\n that are placed in the browser?\n\n2:21:56.300 --> 2:21:57.580\n The ads are all placed in the browser.\n\n2:21:57.580 --> 2:21:58.840\n Some people have this sort of model\n\n2:21:58.840 --> 2:22:01.620\n that the server's painting the ad into some,\n\n2:22:01.620 --> 2:22:06.500\n flash combined package or into some giant image\n\n2:22:06.500 --> 2:22:08.600\n and then it all gets sent down, that's not how it works.\n\n2:22:08.600 --> 2:22:11.340\n All the ads you see on the web are placed in your browser\n\n2:22:11.340 --> 2:22:13.980\n by it calling out to various ad tech partners\n\n2:22:13.980 --> 2:22:15.620\n and Google's among them.\n\n2:22:15.620 --> 2:22:17.580\n And so if you block those scripts,\n\n2:22:17.580 --> 2:22:22.420\n you break the advertising flow of money\n\n2:22:22.420 --> 2:22:26.300\n from the brands and their agencies to the publishers.\n\n2:22:26.300 --> 2:22:29.460\n And if you want to reconnect it directly with the user,\n\n2:22:29.460 --> 2:22:30.420\n you have limited choices.\n\n2:22:30.420 --> 2:22:31.940\n The user generally isn't gonna sign up\n\n2:22:31.940 --> 2:22:34.980\n with a ACH bank connection or a credit card.\n\n2:22:34.980 --> 2:22:37.260\n The publisher isn't gonna sign up the user\n\n2:22:37.260 --> 2:22:39.980\n except as a subscriber and then they're gonna overcharge you\n\n2:22:39.980 --> 2:22:42.060\n because they want you to cross subsidize all the content\n\n2:22:42.060 --> 2:22:43.660\n and buy more than you read and all that stuff.\n\n2:22:43.660 --> 2:22:47.220\n And how many, people are doing great who are big names\n\n2:22:47.220 --> 2:22:48.740\n like New York Times and The Washington Post,\n\n2:22:48.740 --> 2:22:51.820\n but how many subscriptions are you as a user gonna pay for?\n\n2:22:51.820 --> 2:22:54.420\n This is why startups like Tony Hale Scroll\n\n2:22:54.420 --> 2:22:57.160\n are trying to do a portable subscription system.\n\n2:22:57.160 --> 2:22:58.860\n By the way, just a small tangent there,\n\n2:22:58.860 --> 2:23:00.860\n even the New York Times is really annoying\n\n2:23:00.860 --> 2:23:03.300\n how difficult it is to subscribe.\n\n2:23:03.300 --> 2:23:04.620\n There's way too many clicks.\n\n2:23:04.620 --> 2:23:05.460\n They don't make it easy.\n\n2:23:05.460 --> 2:23:06.300\n And I had friends a few years ago,\n\n2:23:06.300 --> 2:23:08.340\n I think they fixed this, who would pay for the paper\n\n2:23:08.340 --> 2:23:11.140\n and then they'd go online and they get upcharged\n\n2:23:11.140 --> 2:23:13.140\n for the digital and there was no break.\n\n2:23:13.140 --> 2:23:15.380\n There was no connection between them.\n\n2:23:15.380 --> 2:23:17.260\n But publishers are not that technical\n\n2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:19.580\n and they can't all get you to subscribe.\n\n2:23:19.580 --> 2:23:21.300\n You can't have a thousand subscriptions.\n\n2:23:21.300 --> 2:23:23.460\n So for a long time, people talked about micropayments.\n\n2:23:23.460 --> 2:23:25.860\n There was Blendle and other ones which came to the US,\n\n2:23:25.860 --> 2:23:27.580\n but it didn't grow.\n\n2:23:27.580 --> 2:23:29.820\n And I thought, if you have just a browser\n\n2:23:29.820 --> 2:23:31.200\n and it's protecting you by blocking\n\n2:23:31.200 --> 2:23:32.900\n all this ad tech tracking junk,\n\n2:23:33.820 --> 2:23:36.620\n it can provide you an option that uses cryptocurrency\n\n2:23:36.620 --> 2:23:39.420\n to let you support your favorite sites\n\n2:23:39.420 --> 2:23:40.580\n and even YouTube channels.\n\n2:23:40.580 --> 2:23:42.740\n And that we prototyped with Bitcoin.\n\n2:23:42.740 --> 2:23:45.940\n And that meant the user had to be of means to contribute\n\n2:23:45.940 --> 2:23:47.480\n and willing to contribute,\n\n2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:49.220\n but it could be done on the Bitcoin blockchain\n\n2:23:49.220 --> 2:23:50.560\n and it could be fairly efficient\n\n2:23:50.560 --> 2:23:52.260\n even though Bitcoin went through a period\n\n2:23:52.260 --> 2:23:55.740\n when we had this prototype running in 2016 into 2017\n\n2:23:55.740 --> 2:23:58.780\n where Bitcoin was very congested and very slow to confirm\n\n2:23:58.780 --> 2:24:00.140\n and the fees got very high.\n\n2:24:01.020 --> 2:24:03.540\n And a lot of users who were not Bitcoin maximalists\n\n2:24:03.540 --> 2:24:04.940\n or even experienced,\n\n2:24:04.940 --> 2:24:07.620\n we helped them out by embedding a Coinbase buy widget\n\n2:24:07.620 --> 2:24:10.180\n and they had the income to buy, but it was hard.\n\n2:24:10.180 --> 2:24:12.420\n It was like, do I buy $5 a month?\n\n2:24:12.420 --> 2:24:14.320\n But the fee is like 450.\n\n2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:16.420\n I better buy in larger batches, right?\n\n2:24:16.420 --> 2:24:18.540\n And they're like, I don't wanna own that much Bitcoin.\n\n2:24:18.540 --> 2:24:21.180\n So it became this painful thing.\n\n2:24:21.180 --> 2:24:23.800\n And the real idea that I had of private ads\n\n2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:25.940\n that pay the user a rev share\n\n2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:30.580\n couldn't be realized alone in that kind of system.\n\n2:24:30.580 --> 2:24:33.060\n In these cryptocurrency systems,\n\n2:24:33.060 --> 2:24:35.180\n especially with the blockchain we switched to Ethereum,\n\n2:24:35.180 --> 2:24:36.920\n you can have smart contracts.\n\n2:24:36.920 --> 2:24:38.980\n The Bitcoin system is not turned complete.\n\n2:24:38.980 --> 2:24:41.100\n So what you can do with the scripts is more limited,\n\n2:24:41.100 --> 2:24:44.500\n but you can still do sort of clever things\n\n2:24:44.500 --> 2:24:46.140\n even with Bitcoin script.\n\n2:24:46.140 --> 2:24:49.280\n What we wanted to do was sort of a three sided ecosystem.\n\n2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:53.740\n We wanted users, creators or publishers and advertisers.\n\n2:24:53.740 --> 2:24:55.740\n And we wanted the advertisers to put money in\n\n2:24:55.740 --> 2:24:57.140\n just like they do today,\n\n2:24:57.140 --> 2:25:00.380\n but without going through the Googles and the app nexuses\n\n2:25:00.380 --> 2:25:01.980\n and all these other ad tech companies,\n\n2:25:01.980 --> 2:25:04.420\n because those companies take out a huge cut.\n\n2:25:04.420 --> 2:25:06.940\n The Guardian in the UK once did an experiment for a month.\n\n2:25:06.940 --> 2:25:08.820\n They bought out their own ad space.\n\n2:25:08.820 --> 2:25:11.180\n They put in a pound and they were paid 30 pence.\n\n2:25:11.180 --> 2:25:15.200\n 70% was coming out to the intermediary vendors\n\n2:25:15.200 --> 2:25:16.120\n they were using.\n\n2:25:17.020 --> 2:25:19.260\n And that's like the opposite of what the app store does.\n\n2:25:19.260 --> 2:25:22.220\n The app store takes 30% and gives the publisher 70%.\n\n2:25:22.220 --> 2:25:26.180\n So pretty broken, in the old days of the superstation TBS,\n\n2:25:26.180 --> 2:25:29.900\n the media owner would get 85%.\n\n2:25:29.900 --> 2:25:33.460\n So these splits have become really unbalanced\n\n2:25:33.460 --> 2:25:35.720\n and the middle players, the ad tech vendors\n\n2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:37.420\n are taking out way too much money.\n\n2:25:37.420 --> 2:25:39.700\n And they're doing something worse, which has been noticed.\n\n2:25:39.700 --> 2:25:44.060\n They're letting not just the malware vendors,\n\n2:25:44.060 --> 2:25:47.220\n but also the ad fraud side, which fakes the publishers\n\n2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:52.120\n and clickbait merchants come in and steal traffic\n\n2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:53.220\n from good sites.\n\n2:25:53.220 --> 2:25:55.640\n Because once you have a certain audience identified\n\n2:25:55.640 --> 2:25:57.500\n at one site, Jason Calconas told me this\n\n2:25:57.500 --> 2:25:59.900\n about his experience with, I guess it was in Gadget,\n\n2:25:59.900 --> 2:26:01.620\n I forget which site he was running.\n\n2:26:01.620 --> 2:26:04.180\n But once he started using an ad partner\n\n2:26:04.180 --> 2:26:06.200\n that was sharing his audience information\n\n2:26:06.200 --> 2:26:08.420\n across multiple sites, he saw his competitors\n\n2:26:08.420 --> 2:26:09.540\n stealing all his traffic.\n\n2:26:09.540 --> 2:26:11.540\n And then what's worse is the clickbait sites\n\n2:26:11.540 --> 2:26:15.500\n that just have much cheaper rates steal all that traffic.\n\n2:26:15.500 --> 2:26:20.300\n And that facilitates fraud, facilitates fake news,\n\n2:26:20.300 --> 2:26:21.340\n all sorts of problems.\n\n2:26:21.340 --> 2:26:24.580\n So Gray blocks it and then we give users the ability\n\n2:26:24.580 --> 2:26:27.460\n to give back and because we invented\n\n2:26:27.460 --> 2:26:28.940\n the basic attention token on Ethereum,\n\n2:26:28.940 --> 2:26:31.020\n we can do this three way split.\n\n2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:33.620\n And we can give users a share of the revenue.\n\n2:26:33.620 --> 2:26:35.500\n And if they want to take it out, they can.\n\n2:26:35.500 --> 2:26:38.240\n Now, unfortunately for us and for all blockchain,\n\n2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:39.800\n the regulators are saying,\n\n2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:41.300\n we're gonna have to know who you are.\n\n2:26:41.300 --> 2:26:46.300\n There's the Treasury Department's FinCEN agency.\n\n2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:50.780\n There's the Office of Foreign Asset Controls, OFAC.\n\n2:26:50.780 --> 2:26:55.260\n There's the other regulators in the federal government\n\n2:26:55.260 --> 2:26:58.260\n that take a very dark look at things like money laundering\n\n2:26:58.260 --> 2:27:01.260\n and sending money to someone named Osama bin Laden.\n\n2:27:01.260 --> 2:27:03.540\n So compliance starts to come in.\n\n2:27:03.540 --> 2:27:06.100\n And even now they're threatening for pure Bitcoin\n\n2:27:06.100 --> 2:27:07.820\n sending to some address.\n\n2:27:07.820 --> 2:27:10.260\n If you're a Coinbase, you're gonna have to know\n\n2:27:10.260 --> 2:27:11.340\n who's at that address.\n\n2:27:11.340 --> 2:27:12.180\n You're gonna have to start.\n\n2:27:12.180 --> 2:27:13.580\n Like the actual identities of people involved.\n\n2:27:13.580 --> 2:27:14.900\n Yeah, now with Coinbase members,\n\n2:27:14.900 --> 2:27:15.900\n you sign up and they know you\n\n2:27:15.900 --> 2:27:16.980\n and they comply with the regulations.\n\n2:27:16.980 --> 2:27:20.220\n They're a regulated money services business.\n\n2:27:20.220 --> 2:27:25.220\n And, but if somebody's using their own self custody,\n\n2:27:25.600 --> 2:27:27.240\n so called self custodial wallet\n\n2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:29.340\n where they have the hardware private key\n\n2:27:29.340 --> 2:27:32.480\n and they're not named and they want to send to that address,\n\n2:27:33.620 --> 2:27:35.080\n our friends in the federal government are talking about\n\n2:27:35.080 --> 2:27:37.560\n requiring at some threshold and knowing who that is.\n\n2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:38.400\n So.\n\n2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:40.460\n Some threshold that's unreasonable.\n\n2:27:40.460 --> 2:27:42.220\n It's not that big.\n\n2:27:42.220 --> 2:27:43.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:27:43.060 --> 2:27:43.880\n Yeah, I don't know how this will play out.\n\n2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:44.820\n I think crypto is here to stay.\n\n2:27:44.820 --> 2:27:47.260\n I think the beauty of being able to send peer to peer\n\n2:27:47.260 --> 2:27:48.500\n without any bank in the middle,\n\n2:27:48.500 --> 2:27:51.620\n without any huge wire charge and two day delay\n\n2:27:51.620 --> 2:27:52.460\n and all that nonsense.\n\n2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:54.340\n It's beautiful and I've used it and I love it.\n\n2:27:54.340 --> 2:27:56.400\n But we're pragmatists are brave about crypto.\n\n2:27:56.400 --> 2:27:59.580\n And we realized that anything like a revenue split,\n\n2:27:59.580 --> 2:28:02.180\n we can't facilitate without being licensed in a certain way\n\n2:28:02.180 --> 2:28:03.880\n and it requires knowing who the user is.\n\n2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:06.460\n So our default mode doesn't know who the user is.\n\n2:28:06.460 --> 2:28:09.540\n It instead imputes to the user's browser,\n\n2:28:09.540 --> 2:28:11.820\n some of the revenue and allows that browser\n\n2:28:11.820 --> 2:28:14.940\n to steer it back to the creators.\n\n2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:16.680\n And we do have to identify the creators.\n\n2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:20.460\n But as things improve and who knows how it'll play out,\n\n2:28:20.460 --> 2:28:22.820\n there should become a day when this full vision\n\n2:28:22.820 --> 2:28:25.740\n can be done more fully on a blockchain.\n\n2:28:25.740 --> 2:28:29.260\n But regulations and the practicalities of today's blockchains,\n\n2:28:29.260 --> 2:28:32.700\n which are not that fast and not anonymous over time,\n\n2:28:32.700 --> 2:28:34.780\n you fingerprint yourself over time.\n\n2:28:34.780 --> 2:28:36.260\n We do some of this with the browser.\n\n2:28:36.260 --> 2:28:39.780\n So one of the ideas of the basic attention token\n\n2:28:39.780 --> 2:28:41.880\n is to make a hybrid system\n\n2:28:41.880 --> 2:28:43.420\n that's stronger than blockchain alone.\n\n2:28:43.420 --> 2:28:45.900\n It's the browser and the blockchain.\n\n2:28:45.900 --> 2:28:48.420\n And the browser is this trusted endpoint software.\n\n2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:49.980\n It's this universal app.\n\n2:28:49.980 --> 2:28:51.120\n Everyone uses browsers.\n\n2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:53.020\n The bigger the screen, the more you're in the browser\n\n2:28:53.020 --> 2:28:56.140\n and the less you install fat clients for things.\n\n2:28:56.140 --> 2:29:00.140\n I use Slack on Mac OS and it's like a browser.\n\n2:29:00.140 --> 2:29:02.140\n It's based on an electron framework we used to use.\n\n2:29:02.140 --> 2:29:04.740\n And it's just, it's not that great.\n\n2:29:04.740 --> 2:29:07.780\n Some of the people at Brave use Slack in Brave as a...\n\n2:29:07.780 --> 2:29:08.620\n In the browser, yeah.\n\n2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:09.440\n In the browser, yeah.\n\n2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:10.340\n I use that often, yeah.\n\n2:29:10.340 --> 2:29:13.140\n And I noticed on the iPad, I use apps less.\n\n2:29:13.140 --> 2:29:16.460\n The smaller the screen, the browser got handicapped\n\n2:29:16.460 --> 2:29:17.960\n by Apple and Android both.\n\n2:29:17.960 --> 2:29:22.700\n And it also can be slower or not have the right affordances,\n\n2:29:22.700 --> 2:29:26.780\n the interface with the security limited APIs.\n\n2:29:26.780 --> 2:29:28.740\n But in principle, with the right permissioning,\n\n2:29:28.740 --> 2:29:31.680\n you can make the web browser just as good as any app.\n\n2:29:31.680 --> 2:29:33.380\n You make it be a super app.\n\n2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:35.120\n And that's part of our mission at Brave.\n\n2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:37.820\n So we want to have the economics that got captured\n\n2:29:37.820 --> 2:29:40.060\n by these big tech companies through tracking\n\n2:29:40.060 --> 2:29:41.380\n and through social networks.\n\n2:29:41.380 --> 2:29:43.300\n We want to block that for your own safety\n\n2:29:43.300 --> 2:29:45.480\n and then let you opt into a cleaner world\n\n2:29:45.480 --> 2:29:47.980\n where you keep your data defended in your browser\n\n2:29:47.980 --> 2:29:49.840\n and you can actually realize value from it.\n\n2:29:49.840 --> 2:29:51.300\n So the way our ad system works,\n\n2:29:51.300 --> 2:29:53.340\n I mentioned it being private, but how does that work?\n\n2:29:53.340 --> 2:29:54.980\n We don't see your data at all.\n\n2:29:54.980 --> 2:29:57.740\n All browsers are sort of the mother of all data feeds,\n\n2:29:57.740 --> 2:30:00.700\n your history, all your searches at all engines.\n\n2:30:00.700 --> 2:30:02.560\n Each engine sees the queries you send to it,\n\n2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:03.500\n but it doesn't see the others,\n\n2:30:03.500 --> 2:30:05.220\n but the browser sees them all.\n\n2:30:05.220 --> 2:30:07.540\n Machine learning in the browser that you can opt into\n\n2:30:07.540 --> 2:30:10.140\n can study all that in a very complete way\n\n2:30:10.140 --> 2:30:11.980\n and do a better job than Google does.\n\n2:30:11.980 --> 2:30:15.180\n Google has cookie and scripts across the web\n\n2:30:15.180 --> 2:30:17.860\n from acquiring DoubleClick, they have YouTube,\n\n2:30:17.860 --> 2:30:19.700\n they have Android, they have search,\n\n2:30:19.700 --> 2:30:21.580\n which is still their big revenue lane,\n\n2:30:21.580 --> 2:30:22.620\n but they don't see everything.\n\n2:30:22.620 --> 2:30:23.780\n The browser sees everything.\n\n2:30:23.780 --> 2:30:25.180\n And if it can do a good job locally,\n\n2:30:25.180 --> 2:30:26.660\n and this is not advanced machine learning,\n\n2:30:26.660 --> 2:30:29.620\n this is not TensorFlow, this is like SVMs now,\n\n2:30:29.620 --> 2:30:34.620\n naive Bayes, then you can match intense signals,\n\n2:30:35.020 --> 2:30:37.180\n intense signals from those data feeds,\n\n2:30:37.180 --> 2:30:40.220\n searches, the queries, the history, how much you're\n\n2:30:40.220 --> 2:30:43.860\n scrolling down a page, how much you redid a search.\n\n2:30:43.860 --> 2:30:47.020\n It's all blind browser algorithm, we don't see that data.\n\n2:30:47.020 --> 2:30:50.820\n And then pick the best ad from a fixed catalog per day.\n\n2:30:50.820 --> 2:30:53.460\n And the catalog is fixed across a large population per day,\n\n2:30:53.460 --> 2:30:55.100\n and it only updates once a day,\n\n2:30:55.100 --> 2:30:57.620\n because new offers come in and old ones expire,\n\n2:30:57.620 --> 2:30:59.620\n sometimes every week or every month.\n\n2:30:59.620 --> 2:31:02.740\n And that catalog, and there can be many such catalogs,\n\n2:31:02.740 --> 2:31:06.220\n is sold by our direct sales team.\n\n2:31:06.220 --> 2:31:09.420\n And so we're making an anonymous audience available\n\n2:31:09.420 --> 2:31:12.020\n to advertisers without the advertisers tracking them.\n\n2:31:12.020 --> 2:31:15.300\n Instead, each browser is a little machine learning system\n\n2:31:15.300 --> 2:31:17.180\n that's picking the best catalog entry.\n\n2:31:17.180 --> 2:31:19.340\n Now, the catalog is not the ads, those are big, right?\n\n2:31:19.340 --> 2:31:21.420\n It's a video or a webpage, it's just the link\n\n2:31:21.420 --> 2:31:23.820\n to an edge cache, and there are many such edge caches.\n\n2:31:23.820 --> 2:31:25.620\n We're not trying to protect them from seeing\n\n2:31:25.620 --> 2:31:27.780\n your IP address, it's not really feasible.\n\n2:31:27.780 --> 2:31:30.260\n We could use Tor, but we don't yet.\n\n2:31:30.260 --> 2:31:31.980\n And then some keywords about the ad.\n\n2:31:31.980 --> 2:31:34.900\n So it's basically like metadata and a link.\n\n2:31:34.900 --> 2:31:36.340\n And that's what the catalog consists of,\n\n2:31:36.340 --> 2:31:37.460\n and that's what the machine learning picks.\n\n2:31:37.460 --> 2:31:39.020\n And the machine learning is learning\n\n2:31:39.020 --> 2:31:41.820\n about the use specifically locally\n\n2:31:41.820 --> 2:31:44.180\n in order to choose from the catalog of different ads.\n\n2:31:44.180 --> 2:31:47.780\n Couldn't this possibly be like a multi billion dollar,\n\n2:31:47.780 --> 2:31:50.980\n isn't this taken on the Google ad?\n\n2:31:50.980 --> 2:31:51.820\n Could be.\n\n2:31:51.820 --> 2:31:54.580\n So like what, I mean, one question to ask,\n\n2:31:54.580 --> 2:31:57.380\n there seems to be some really profound ideas here\n\n2:31:57.380 --> 2:32:01.900\n that are different than what the internet has grown up to be.\n\n2:32:01.900 --> 2:32:05.340\n If Brave or something like Brave,\n\n2:32:05.340 --> 2:32:07.580\n the ideas, the fundamental philosophical ideas\n\n2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:12.580\n underlying Brave went out and runs 95% of the internet,\n\n2:32:13.100 --> 2:32:18.100\n how does that change the, what are the major things\n\n2:32:18.500 --> 2:32:19.620\n these changes about the internet?\n\n2:32:19.620 --> 2:32:21.620\n So social networks and then the creatives,\n\n2:32:21.620 --> 2:32:23.660\n like YouTube creators and all that kind of stuff.\n\n2:32:23.660 --> 2:32:24.580\n So let's talk about that.\n\n2:32:24.580 --> 2:32:26.260\n First of all, if Brave gets 95%,\n\n2:32:26.260 --> 2:32:29.100\n I'm gonna demand a recount, because I won't believe it.\n\n2:32:29.100 --> 2:32:31.980\n I don't know, I think we're trying to put things\n\n2:32:31.980 --> 2:32:34.980\n into web standards that can be standardized across browsers.\n\n2:32:34.980 --> 2:32:38.940\n So the main value of Brave will be the trust users have in us\n\n2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:41.340\n and our ability to give the best deal to users.\n\n2:32:41.340 --> 2:32:45.140\n So 70% of the gross ad revenue we give to the user.\n\n2:32:45.140 --> 2:32:47.940\n And if they go through that KYC process I mentioned,\n\n2:32:47.940 --> 2:32:48.940\n they can take it out.\n\n2:32:48.940 --> 2:32:50.620\n They can also give it back, they can take some out,\n\n2:32:50.620 --> 2:32:51.460\n give the rest back.\n\n2:32:51.460 --> 2:32:54.660\n They can add basic attention tokens to give back.\n\n2:32:54.660 --> 2:32:56.140\n Some of them turn off the ads,\n\n2:32:56.140 --> 2:32:57.220\n cause they just don't like ads,\n\n2:32:57.220 --> 2:32:58.980\n but they put in $20 a month.\n\n2:32:58.980 --> 2:33:01.140\n But I believe Zuko of Zcashframe does that.\n\n2:33:01.140 --> 2:33:02.060\n And that's very generous,\n\n2:33:02.060 --> 2:33:04.100\n because the browser is just anonymously\n\n2:33:04.100 --> 2:33:06.260\n based on his browsing, sort of keeping score\n\n2:33:06.260 --> 2:33:09.540\n on how much time he spent on this video, on that website.\n\n2:33:09.540 --> 2:33:13.260\n And if those sites verify in sort of a,\n\n2:33:13.260 --> 2:33:15.240\n like getting a domain certificate fashion,\n\n2:33:15.240 --> 2:33:19.260\n they can get paid, they can get part of his $20 a month.\n\n2:33:19.260 --> 2:33:21.140\n So that vision could go big.\n\n2:33:21.140 --> 2:33:23.400\n And if it does, I hope it's across multiple browsers.\n\n2:33:23.400 --> 2:33:25.980\n I don't know that they'll all compete well\n\n2:33:25.980 --> 2:33:29.020\n on the quality of the ads, the quality of the ad blocking\n\n2:33:29.020 --> 2:33:30.340\n and tracking protection.\n\n2:33:30.340 --> 2:33:31.860\n Those are subject to competition.\n\n2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:33.380\n It'll take a while to standardize them.\n\n2:33:33.380 --> 2:33:35.380\n But I think that would be a better world.\n\n2:33:35.380 --> 2:33:38.220\n It would have less counterparty risk,\n\n2:33:38.220 --> 2:33:40.740\n fewer fee takers in the middle, really just the browser.\n\n2:33:40.740 --> 2:33:44.580\n We're taking 30%, sort of the app store split.\n\n2:33:44.580 --> 2:33:47.420\n And if we get bigger, maybe we can take even less.\n\n2:33:47.420 --> 2:33:49.540\n Social networks, creators.\n\n2:33:49.540 --> 2:33:52.220\n If you look at YouTubers, a lot of them are the indies\n\n2:33:52.220 --> 2:33:56.700\n that are getting some size are getting sponsorship deals.\n\n2:33:56.700 --> 2:33:58.840\n They're using Patreon.\n\n2:33:58.840 --> 2:34:01.420\n They're encouraging people to subscribe\n\n2:34:01.420 --> 2:34:04.300\n and give them regular money through Patreon.\n\n2:34:04.300 --> 2:34:06.080\n But that's centralized through Patreon.\n\n2:34:06.080 --> 2:34:09.840\n So there's censorship hazards, there's a 5% fee.\n\n2:34:09.840 --> 2:34:10.960\n What if that were a web standard?\n\n2:34:10.960 --> 2:34:14.500\n What if Brave pioneered it first and we took 3%?\n\n2:34:14.500 --> 2:34:17.460\n And we did it in a way that was through your browser\n\n2:34:17.460 --> 2:34:19.180\n so we couldn't censor it.\n\n2:34:19.180 --> 2:34:20.220\n That's brilliant.\n\n2:34:20.220 --> 2:34:22.780\n Do you think it could be standardized across browsers?\n\n2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:25.580\n Can Internet Explorer come in again and...\n\n2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:27.900\n Yeah, protocols are easy to copy\n\n2:34:27.900 --> 2:34:29.500\n in that they're meant to be interoperable.\n\n2:34:29.500 --> 2:34:31.100\n So there's a risk there.\n\n2:34:31.100 --> 2:34:33.980\n And the loyal users might be tricked into leaving you.\n\n2:34:33.980 --> 2:34:36.180\n Or they might, because of that distribution power,\n\n2:34:36.180 --> 2:34:38.260\n you might end up getting stomped.\n\n2:34:38.260 --> 2:34:39.640\n I don't know, I can't predict the future.\n\n2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.300\n I think antitrust is back on the case finally in the US.\n\n2:34:42.300 --> 2:34:45.420\n And certainly in Europe, G Comp is doing its thing.\n\n2:34:45.420 --> 2:34:48.820\n So I'm hopeful that we'll have a period of innovation.\n\n2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:50.620\n People were talking, like Elizabeth Warren was talking\n\n2:34:50.620 --> 2:34:53.700\n about breaking up the tech companies very clearly.\n\n2:34:53.700 --> 2:34:56.460\n Now she didn't win, and I suspect that won't happen,\n\n2:34:56.460 --> 2:34:58.400\n but I also suspect that Google might be smart enough\n\n2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:01.040\n to see they should do something more\n\n2:35:01.040 --> 2:35:03.380\n than just put privacy perfume on Chrome.\n\n2:35:03.380 --> 2:35:05.300\n They should maybe get rid of DoubleClick or something,\n\n2:35:05.300 --> 2:35:06.700\n divest something.\n\n2:35:06.700 --> 2:35:07.780\n I don't know, it might happen.\n\n2:35:07.780 --> 2:35:10.380\n So Brave might inspire Google to completely change\n\n2:35:10.380 --> 2:35:11.420\n the way they're doing things in the browser?\n\n2:35:11.420 --> 2:35:12.780\n They're already doing something,\n\n2:35:12.780 --> 2:35:15.460\n you may have read about called the Privacy Sandbox\n\n2:35:15.460 --> 2:35:20.020\n or Flock, which they have this bird metaphor going,\n\n2:35:20.020 --> 2:35:22.780\n Turtle Dove, Fledge.\n\n2:35:22.780 --> 2:35:25.860\n But these systems have been very Googley,\n\n2:35:25.860 --> 2:35:27.820\n kind of overengineered, and yet,\n\n2:35:27.820 --> 2:35:29.260\n depending on differential privacy,\n\n2:35:29.260 --> 2:35:31.420\n which has weakness over time, if you know how that works,\n\n2:35:31.420 --> 2:35:34.260\n it's kind of injecting noise to hide you in a crowd,\n\n2:35:34.260 --> 2:35:37.660\n but over time an adversary can pull you out of the crowd.\n\n2:35:37.660 --> 2:35:39.380\n This doesn't look like it's gonna become a standard.\n\n2:35:39.380 --> 2:35:42.740\n Like Apple, Brave, Mozilla, we're not gonna just say,\n\n2:35:42.740 --> 2:35:44.700\n oh, Google, you saved us.\n\n2:35:44.700 --> 2:35:46.060\n You've invented the Privacy Sandbox,\n\n2:35:46.060 --> 2:35:47.660\n so we'll all just adopt it.\n\n2:35:47.660 --> 2:35:48.580\n Not gonna be that easy.\n\n2:35:48.580 --> 2:35:51.540\n It's gonna be more like pieces of what we do in Brave,\n\n2:35:51.540 --> 2:35:54.420\n the synonymous ad matching or the blind signature\n\n2:35:54.420 --> 2:35:57.020\n cryptography we use to confirm the ad impressions.\n\n2:35:57.020 --> 2:35:59.260\n That's David Chow's invention.\n\n2:35:59.260 --> 2:36:00.340\n That could get standardized.\n\n2:36:00.340 --> 2:36:02.220\n In fact, some of that is being standardized.\n\n2:36:02.220 --> 2:36:04.460\n Even Google's in favor of so called trust tokens,\n\n2:36:04.460 --> 2:36:07.460\n which are Chowmian blind signature certs.\n\n2:36:07.460 --> 2:36:09.300\n But they're not using them for ad confirmations\n\n2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:11.460\n because they don't wanna blow up their own business.\n\n2:36:11.460 --> 2:36:14.740\n And they need to let some of the publishers they serve\n\n2:36:14.740 --> 2:36:17.340\n have other ad tech scripts on the page.\n\n2:36:17.340 --> 2:36:18.620\n And so they're kind of caught.\n\n2:36:18.620 --> 2:36:19.860\n And this is something I realized doing Brave.\n\n2:36:19.860 --> 2:36:22.900\n I thought, what's Google's innovators dilemma\n\n2:36:22.900 --> 2:36:26.300\n apart from just being mature and having trouble innovating?\n\n2:36:26.300 --> 2:36:30.620\n It's that they have come to depend on this ad tech system\n\n2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:34.980\n that has all these vendors that publishers rely on\n\n2:36:34.980 --> 2:36:36.380\n because publishers aren't technical enough.\n\n2:36:36.380 --> 2:36:37.980\n And I feel for the publishers,\n\n2:36:37.980 --> 2:36:39.900\n but I realized the users have to come first.\n\n2:36:39.900 --> 2:36:43.700\n And if you give the users a better browser that's faster,\n\n2:36:43.700 --> 2:36:46.220\n then you'll get enough users to give back\n\n2:36:46.220 --> 2:36:47.700\n or support publishers.\n\n2:36:47.700 --> 2:36:49.420\n The speed and the battery savings\n\n2:36:49.420 --> 2:36:51.140\n and the data plan savings are significant.\n\n2:36:51.140 --> 2:36:53.340\n There's so much bad JavaScript involved in ad tech\n\n2:36:53.340 --> 2:36:55.740\n that if you block it, you sort of chop off\n\n2:36:55.740 --> 2:36:57.500\n what's called the programmatic waterfall,\n\n2:36:57.500 --> 2:36:59.140\n which chains a bunch of requests.\n\n2:36:59.140 --> 2:37:01.220\n Yeah, that's one of the incredible things about Brave.\n\n2:37:01.220 --> 2:37:03.220\n I guess you're saying you should attribute it\n\n2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:06.620\n to the fact that the messy JavaScript, no offense.\n\n2:37:06.620 --> 2:37:07.460\n No offense.\n\n2:37:07.460 --> 2:37:08.300\n Not my solution.\n\n2:37:08.300 --> 2:37:13.300\n I mean, Brave just feels faster.\n\n2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:16.420\n Even then, I mean, Chrome was fast.\n\n2:37:16.420 --> 2:37:18.420\n One of the things that it was like impressive\n\n2:37:18.420 --> 2:37:21.620\n is it showed that browsers can be really fast\n\n2:37:21.620 --> 2:37:24.260\n and Brave is even faster than that, which is incredible.\n\n2:37:24.260 --> 2:37:26.940\n And it saves the network, which means data plan.\n\n2:37:26.940 --> 2:37:29.420\n It saves battery because the radio consumes your battery\n\n2:37:29.420 --> 2:37:31.140\n when it's running more to do those requests.\n\n2:37:31.140 --> 2:37:32.940\n And it's just stunning how many there are.\n\n2:37:32.940 --> 2:37:34.600\n Like some of my Google friends were like,\n\n2:37:34.600 --> 2:37:35.860\n oh, that's just that bad site.\n\n2:37:35.860 --> 2:37:36.700\n They'll fix it.\n\n2:37:36.700 --> 2:37:38.580\n And you actually do a survey of web pages\n\n2:37:38.580 --> 2:37:40.340\n that they're like mostly like that.\n\n2:37:40.340 --> 2:37:42.460\n I know Google engineers could make everything\n\n2:37:42.460 --> 2:37:44.300\n super efficient, but they can't,\n\n2:37:44.300 --> 2:37:45.780\n especially in antitrust court, do it.\n\n2:37:45.780 --> 2:37:48.460\n They cannot take over all the publishers and do that.\n\n2:37:48.460 --> 2:37:51.780\n They're trying with accelerated mobile profile, AMP.\n\n2:37:51.780 --> 2:37:53.460\n They're trying to pull publishers.\n\n2:37:53.460 --> 2:37:54.620\n They're like, oh, you poor publishers\n\n2:37:54.620 --> 2:37:56.900\n don't know how to make your pages fast.\n\n2:37:56.900 --> 2:37:58.180\n Put them on our AMP system.\n\n2:37:58.180 --> 2:38:00.660\n We'll give you extra placement in the search carousel.\n\n2:38:00.660 --> 2:38:02.420\n That's an antitrust problem for one.\n\n2:38:02.420 --> 2:38:04.340\n But it's also publishers we talk to hate it\n\n2:38:04.340 --> 2:38:06.020\n because it degrades their brand.\n\n2:38:06.020 --> 2:38:08.020\n Now they look like a gig writer wrote a piece\n\n2:38:08.020 --> 2:38:12.140\n that's got Google's framing an AMP URL on top of it.\n\n2:38:12.140 --> 2:38:13.340\n And they're trying to fix that too.\n\n2:38:13.340 --> 2:38:16.340\n But it just looks like Google's Borgifying\n\n2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:18.160\n all these publishers and they don't want to be plugged\n\n2:38:18.160 --> 2:38:19.020\n into the Borg cube.\n\n2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:22.040\n They want to build up their own brand and have loyal readers.\n\n2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:25.580\n So, you know, I'm in favor of giving the users power\n\n2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:28.740\n to help all the publishers and the little platoons\n\n2:38:28.740 --> 2:38:29.580\n and the creators.\n\n2:38:29.580 --> 2:38:30.860\n And so we talked about Patreon.\n\n2:38:30.860 --> 2:38:31.980\n What about social networks?\n\n2:38:31.980 --> 2:38:35.420\n Well, they're inherently like search, a global algorithm.\n\n2:38:35.420 --> 2:38:37.100\n You're trying to find friends of friends.\n\n2:38:37.100 --> 2:38:39.340\n You're doing the transitive closure of a graph\n\n2:38:39.340 --> 2:38:41.700\n induced by this friend of relation.\n\n2:38:41.700 --> 2:38:45.320\n But you should own your friend relation.\n\n2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:46.980\n You should own your posts.\n\n2:38:46.980 --> 2:38:48.660\n They shouldn't be owned by somebody else\n\n2:38:48.660 --> 2:38:51.060\n who can take them down or censor them.\n\n2:38:51.060 --> 2:38:52.540\n And your friend relations, you should be able\n\n2:38:52.540 --> 2:38:54.220\n to find those friends on other networks.\n\n2:38:54.220 --> 2:38:55.420\n And that's why I've tweeted about this.\n\n2:38:55.420 --> 2:38:56.700\n I haven't built it yet.\n\n2:38:56.700 --> 2:38:59.740\n What if the browser could keep track of those for you?\n\n2:38:59.740 --> 2:39:03.500\n What if the browser could maybe combine Facebook and Twitter\n\n2:39:03.500 --> 2:39:05.300\n and you could find your friends on both\n\n2:39:05.300 --> 2:39:06.780\n and you could have a sort of multi.\n\n2:39:06.780 --> 2:39:09.900\n So that relationship is not owned by Facebook or Twitter.\n\n2:39:09.900 --> 2:39:12.020\n It's owned by you through the browser.\n\n2:39:12.020 --> 2:39:14.020\n They'll have terms of use and they'll say they own it.\n\n2:39:14.020 --> 2:39:17.000\n But if they zap you on one and you're still on the other,\n\n2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:18.500\n your friends find you and the browser\n\n2:39:18.500 --> 2:39:20.820\n could preserve a combined view.\n\n2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:23.800\n You could resurrect almost across networks.\n\n2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:26.600\n It's something I wanna maybe quickly ask you about.\n\n2:39:26.600 --> 2:39:31.340\n On that front, there's been quite a lot of centralized,\n\n2:39:31.340 --> 2:39:35.260\n we talked about Wall Street Bets and then Robinhood.\n\n2:39:35.260 --> 2:39:39.300\n There's been centralized banning of different accounts\n\n2:39:39.300 --> 2:39:42.620\n and removing like Parler, for example, from AWS\n\n2:39:42.620 --> 2:39:46.740\n and this kind of overreach of centralized control.\n\n2:39:46.740 --> 2:39:49.360\n Is your hope that it's possible to,\n\n2:39:49.360 --> 2:39:51.300\n like what are your thoughts about that in general?\n\n2:39:51.300 --> 2:39:54.480\n And then is it possible to create tools\n\n2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:56.700\n that give individual people the power\n\n2:39:56.700 --> 2:40:00.060\n to fight back against overreach of such control?\n\n2:40:00.060 --> 2:40:02.660\n So we're talking about oligarchy, I do think.\n\n2:40:02.660 --> 2:40:05.260\n And if it controls a nation state, that's formidable.\n\n2:40:05.260 --> 2:40:08.220\n It's the tax and the police power, the military power.\n\n2:40:08.220 --> 2:40:10.860\n It means that you may have the great firewall of China.\n\n2:40:10.860 --> 2:40:13.380\n You may have people in China who are jailed\n\n2:40:13.380 --> 2:40:14.880\n because of their tweets, right?\n\n2:40:14.880 --> 2:40:15.740\n This is a serious threat.\n\n2:40:15.740 --> 2:40:18.240\n I can't minimize it or say that we'll win.\n\n2:40:18.240 --> 2:40:19.980\n I don't know how it's gonna go.\n\n2:40:19.980 --> 2:40:21.660\n But I do think, like I said earlier\n\n2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:24.000\n about the kind of reason people find ways around things.\n\n2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:25.820\n The internet routes around censorship.\n\n2:40:25.820 --> 2:40:28.820\n And this is not to endorse any particular bad faction.\n\n2:40:28.820 --> 2:40:29.900\n One of the things that happens\n\n2:40:29.900 --> 2:40:33.020\n when you try to wave the free speech flag too much,\n\n2:40:33.020 --> 2:40:34.620\n you say, I'm not gonna censor anything\n\n2:40:34.620 --> 2:40:37.900\n and you get colonized by terrible, terrible people.\n\n2:40:37.900 --> 2:40:39.820\n I don't care if you call them neo Nazis,\n\n2:40:39.820 --> 2:40:41.840\n some of them could be doing illegal things.\n\n2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:44.020\n And you don't want them colonizing\n\n2:40:44.020 --> 2:40:45.220\n because it'll ruin your reputation\n\n2:40:45.220 --> 2:40:46.380\n and destroy your business.\n\n2:40:46.380 --> 2:40:48.740\n So what you really want is that kind of\n\n2:40:48.740 --> 2:40:51.580\n user first subsidiarity, that subjectivity.\n\n2:40:51.580 --> 2:40:55.320\n I want my social networks to be composited\n\n2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:57.100\n in some multi social user interface\n\n2:40:57.100 --> 2:40:59.420\n where I don't lose track of people across networks.\n\n2:40:59.420 --> 2:41:01.620\n And if they leave one or they get banned from one,\n\n2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:02.520\n I can find them on another,\n\n2:41:02.520 --> 2:41:04.360\n I can still sort of thread them together.\n\n2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:05.200\n That's brilliant.\n\n2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:07.740\n And this didn't happen because browsers\n\n2:41:07.740 --> 2:41:10.060\n got captured by the central powers.\n\n2:41:10.060 --> 2:41:10.900\n Why did they get captured?\n\n2:41:10.900 --> 2:41:11.900\n Mostly because of search.\n\n2:41:11.900 --> 2:41:13.740\n And search is a central algorithm.\n\n2:41:13.740 --> 2:41:15.620\n So Larry Page said this too many years ago.\n\n2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:17.960\n He said, with search, you're giving up a little privacy\n\n2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:19.820\n by handing the query over to us.\n\n2:41:19.820 --> 2:41:21.460\n And we'll error correct it.\n\n2:41:21.460 --> 2:41:24.340\n Alan used to be a Google executive.\n\n2:41:24.340 --> 2:41:25.600\n He said, oh yeah, we used to laugh.\n\n2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:27.480\n They'd all be doing typos and they'd be typing\n\n2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:28.320\n the wrong word.\n\n2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:29.760\n And we'd be like, no dummy, type that query.\n\n2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:31.340\n And it's like, okay Google,\n\n2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:33.060\n might want to dial back that ego a little bit.\n\n2:41:33.060 --> 2:41:35.260\n But yes, you do see all the queries\n\n2:41:35.260 --> 2:41:37.340\n and you can improve them and you can find the best results.\n\n2:41:37.340 --> 2:41:38.900\n And that was Google's forte.\n\n2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:40.580\n When we did the Firefox deal in 2004,\n\n2:41:40.580 --> 2:41:42.380\n Google was really good.\n\n2:41:42.380 --> 2:41:46.260\n And over time, SEO, which is an adversarial game,\n\n2:41:46.260 --> 2:41:48.580\n and Google itself buying all these companies\n\n2:41:48.580 --> 2:41:50.100\n and crowding its own results page\n\n2:41:50.100 --> 2:41:53.160\n with its own tied in stuff.\n\n2:41:53.160 --> 2:41:54.000\n The YouTube.\n\n2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:55.260\n It's a slippery slope that happens\n\n2:41:55.260 --> 2:41:58.380\n when you have control over these kinds\n\n2:41:58.380 --> 2:42:00.020\n of really important mechanisms.\n\n2:42:00.020 --> 2:42:02.140\n Yeah, monopoly capitalism or cartel.\n\n2:42:02.140 --> 2:42:05.300\n You get this with the Robin Hoods and the hedge funds.\n\n2:42:05.300 --> 2:42:07.940\n You get sort of the money interests take over\n\n2:42:07.940 --> 2:42:10.100\n and kind of abuse their power and wear out their welcome.\n\n2:42:10.100 --> 2:42:11.940\n So how do you get around that?\n\n2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:15.380\n You have to have either new land to go to,\n\n2:42:15.380 --> 2:42:18.220\n which some people's ancestors, not mine,\n\n2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:19.600\n did to found the country.\n\n2:42:20.820 --> 2:42:22.780\n I'm mostly Irish, German.\n\n2:42:22.780 --> 2:42:26.020\n You have new virtual space people go to\n\n2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:30.300\n and that requires an ISP or a colo center\n\n2:42:30.300 --> 2:42:32.060\n or Amazon to host you.\n\n2:42:32.060 --> 2:42:35.980\n It requires domain name registrar who will not strike you.\n\n2:42:35.980 --> 2:42:38.300\n And so when Parler was taken down,\n\n2:42:39.580 --> 2:42:40.860\n I thought that was egregious.\n\n2:42:40.860 --> 2:42:42.980\n Parler, it was not well designed\n\n2:42:42.980 --> 2:42:45.900\n and I tried it out because I tried all these things,\n\n2:42:45.900 --> 2:42:46.740\n but I didn't use it.\n\n2:42:46.740 --> 2:42:49.380\n And I also felt they were being unfairly scored\n\n2:42:49.380 --> 2:42:51.780\n for not moderating because you can find tweets to this day\n\n2:42:51.780 --> 2:42:54.640\n that are horrendous and threaten all sorts of violence.\n\n2:42:54.640 --> 2:42:56.700\n Whereas Twitter, why isn't Twitter being taken down?\n\n2:42:56.700 --> 2:42:57.640\n But so it was very selective.\n\n2:42:57.640 --> 2:42:59.900\n It was the insiders who have the power\n\n2:42:59.900 --> 2:43:01.660\n are gonna take out the newcomer.\n\n2:43:01.660 --> 2:43:05.380\n And it looked bad, sort of like the hedge funds,\n\n2:43:05.380 --> 2:43:08.060\n shorting GameStop, looked bad.\n\n2:43:08.060 --> 2:43:10.060\n You're seeing a piece in Time Magazine this week\n\n2:43:10.060 --> 2:43:11.340\n that's like basically saying,\n\n2:43:11.340 --> 2:43:12.660\n yeah, we interfere with the election,\n\n2:43:12.660 --> 2:43:14.580\n but it was great, aren't we good?\n\n2:43:14.580 --> 2:43:16.620\n I don't know if you've seen this piece yet.\n\n2:43:16.620 --> 2:43:18.980\n If you tried to say that as a Trump supporter\n\n2:43:18.980 --> 2:43:21.500\n in November after the election,\n\n2:43:21.500 --> 2:43:22.900\n you'd get banned from Twitter.\n\n2:43:22.900 --> 2:43:25.980\n But now Time in its Twitter account is saying,\n\n2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:30.260\n we saved the day, it's AFL, CIO and big business,\n\n2:43:30.260 --> 2:43:32.060\n the Better Business Bureau got together\n\n2:43:32.060 --> 2:43:34.980\n and kept Trump from spreading fake news.\n\n2:43:34.980 --> 2:43:36.860\n So the country's kind of broken.\n\n2:43:36.860 --> 2:43:37.820\n I don't know how to fix that.\n\n2:43:37.820 --> 2:43:40.180\n The oligarchs have run wild in my opinion.\n\n2:43:40.180 --> 2:43:42.780\n And big tech is in the antitrust dock.\n\n2:43:42.780 --> 2:43:43.740\n What's gonna happen?\n\n2:43:43.740 --> 2:43:44.780\n I don't think they get out.\n\n2:43:44.780 --> 2:43:47.900\n I think some of the DOJ and certainly the state cases,\n\n2:43:47.900 --> 2:43:49.060\n because they're separate cases,\n\n2:43:49.060 --> 2:43:50.100\n are not gonna go away just\n\n2:43:50.100 --> 2:43:52.420\n because somebody got elected differently.\n\n2:43:52.420 --> 2:43:53.900\n And these are career prosecutors\n\n2:43:53.900 --> 2:43:55.940\n and they have a strong case.\n\n2:43:55.940 --> 2:43:56.780\n And Google's smart.\n\n2:43:56.780 --> 2:43:59.620\n And Microsoft almost got split up, right?\n\n2:43:59.620 --> 2:44:02.780\n The judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, he overreached.\n\n2:44:02.780 --> 2:44:05.020\n He didn't hold a hearing about the remedy.\n\n2:44:05.020 --> 2:44:06.820\n He just said, I'm gonna break you up.\n\n2:44:06.820 --> 2:44:10.580\n And Microsoft appealed and the higher level court said,\n\n2:44:10.580 --> 2:44:11.660\n go back and figure this out.\n\n2:44:11.660 --> 2:44:12.480\n You're not breaking them up.\n\n2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:13.700\n You didn't even hold a hearing.\n\n2:44:13.700 --> 2:44:15.460\n And when they got back, Microsoft said,\n\n2:44:15.460 --> 2:44:17.660\n let's settle, let's settle, we don't wanna get broken up.\n\n2:44:17.660 --> 2:44:20.500\n Because Jackson was gonna make the Opsco,\n\n2:44:20.500 --> 2:44:21.620\n the operating system company,\n\n2:44:21.620 --> 2:44:24.780\n and the Appsco office, you know, Word and Excel.\n\n2:44:24.780 --> 2:44:28.500\n And that would have been a huge blow to Microsoft, so.\n\n2:44:28.500 --> 2:44:31.140\n But ultimately, I don't know if you're optimistic\n\n2:44:31.140 --> 2:44:34.540\n or cynical about the possibility of breaking up big tech.\n\n2:44:34.540 --> 2:44:39.540\n To me, I'm optimistic that tools like Brave,\n\n2:44:40.060 --> 2:44:42.100\n I love the idea of owning your friendships.\n\n2:44:42.100 --> 2:44:44.660\n Like users more and more owning the stuff\n\n2:44:44.660 --> 2:44:46.460\n is the only real way.\n\n2:44:46.460 --> 2:44:48.540\n Unfortunately, it's like the WallStreetBets subreddit\n\n2:44:48.540 --> 2:44:51.100\n is the only real way to fight decentralized power.\n\n2:44:51.100 --> 2:44:52.700\n You can't break them up with the regulation.\n\n2:44:52.700 --> 2:44:53.540\n It's very difficult.\n\n2:44:53.540 --> 2:44:55.220\n Certainly don't wanna wait for the law.\n\n2:44:55.220 --> 2:44:57.660\n Netscape was long dead or acquired by AOL\n\n2:44:57.660 --> 2:44:58.500\n and effectively dead.\n\n2:44:58.500 --> 2:45:01.980\n It was only Mozilla that returned Firefox to the market\n\n2:45:01.980 --> 2:45:04.140\n by the time that the US v. Microsoft case\n\n2:45:04.140 --> 2:45:07.180\n was finally settled and the penalties were put in place.\n\n2:45:07.180 --> 2:45:11.020\n And yet, antitrust has a role to play.\n\n2:45:11.020 --> 2:45:12.660\n Those penalties caused Microsoft\n\n2:45:12.660 --> 2:45:14.220\n to kind of turn away from the web.\n\n2:45:14.220 --> 2:45:16.060\n They did Windows Vista and they thought,\n\n2:45:16.060 --> 2:45:16.900\n the web's too painful.\n\n2:45:16.900 --> 2:45:19.700\n We got punished in court and we had to standardize things\n\n2:45:19.700 --> 2:45:21.220\n with those icky standards people.\n\n2:45:21.220 --> 2:45:23.460\n So they ran back to proprietary lock in\n\n2:45:23.460 --> 2:45:24.660\n and Windows Vista flopped.\n\n2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:26.620\n It was late, it was bloated.\n\n2:45:26.620 --> 2:45:27.700\n Longhorn, remember?\n\n2:45:27.700 --> 2:45:30.340\n Now, what I was gonna say, but Google's smart enough,\n\n2:45:30.340 --> 2:45:31.620\n they won't get split up.\n\n2:45:31.620 --> 2:45:34.860\n They'll split something out to get off the hook, I think.\n\n2:45:35.780 --> 2:45:39.660\n This is a complicated subject, but I myself was so,\n\n2:45:39.660 --> 2:45:43.220\n I decided to journey out from the world\n\n2:45:43.220 --> 2:45:45.260\n of being a researcher at MIT\n\n2:45:45.260 --> 2:45:48.340\n and potentially doing a startup myself.\n\n2:45:48.340 --> 2:45:51.420\n And I've been thinking of, you know,\n\n2:45:51.420 --> 2:45:53.660\n I wanted to come to Silicon Valley to do so.\n\n2:45:53.660 --> 2:45:55.780\n It's the land of the entrepreneur.\n\n2:45:55.780 --> 2:45:57.980\n And there's a lot of my friends,\n\n2:45:57.980 --> 2:45:59.580\n a lot of them are successfully,\n\n2:45:59.580 --> 2:46:01.380\n have been entrepreneurs themselves,\n\n2:46:01.380 --> 2:46:03.580\n have said, do not come to Silicon Valley.\n\n2:46:04.540 --> 2:46:09.100\n It'd be, you've started, you ran amazing teams of engineers.\n\n2:46:09.100 --> 2:46:12.100\n You started a lot of successful businesses.\n\n2:46:12.100 --> 2:46:15.860\n I wondered if you could comment on why a lot of people\n\n2:46:15.860 --> 2:46:17.180\n are leaving California.\n\n2:46:17.180 --> 2:46:19.780\n Is there something that could be fixed about California?\n\n2:46:19.780 --> 2:46:22.700\n If you were starting a business today,\n\n2:46:22.700 --> 2:46:24.780\n would you consider somewhere else,\n\n2:46:24.780 --> 2:46:27.300\n like Austin or some other place?\n\n2:46:27.300 --> 2:46:30.660\n Or is Silicon Valley still, is it just a little lull,\n\n2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:34.100\n everybody's being overdramatic during this particular year\n\n2:46:34.100 --> 2:46:35.820\n of the coronavirus and so on?\n\n2:46:35.820 --> 2:46:39.220\n I think, you know, even Austin's getting overheated, I hear.\n\n2:46:39.220 --> 2:46:42.420\n And I've had relatives and friends move to Texas\n\n2:46:42.420 --> 2:46:43.260\n within the last few months.\n\n2:46:43.260 --> 2:46:45.860\n So Texas as a whole is a big place.\n\n2:46:45.860 --> 2:46:48.460\n And, you know, people are moving to Florida.\n\n2:46:48.460 --> 2:46:50.700\n There's a big movement toward Miami,\n\n2:46:50.700 --> 2:46:53.260\n Peter Thielke, these people.\n\n2:46:53.260 --> 2:46:56.260\n The mayor has been very business friendly about it,\n\n2:46:56.260 --> 2:46:58.460\n which I think is just good politics.\n\n2:46:58.460 --> 2:47:00.660\n America is fundamentally a commercial republic.\n\n2:47:00.660 --> 2:47:02.540\n So you would think this would be what's happening.\n\n2:47:02.540 --> 2:47:04.420\n For a long time, California was the golden state.\n\n2:47:04.420 --> 2:47:06.820\n I came here in late 76 when I was a teenager.\n\n2:47:06.820 --> 2:47:11.380\n So it's in crushing debt due to the lockdowns.\n\n2:47:11.380 --> 2:47:13.460\n It's got the highest taxes.\n\n2:47:13.460 --> 2:47:14.500\n That's got to matter.\n\n2:47:14.500 --> 2:47:16.480\n People will do high taxes.\n\n2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:21.580\n It's got likely fires every year because of the deadfall.\n\n2:47:21.580 --> 2:47:22.780\n It's not global warming.\n\n2:47:22.780 --> 2:47:24.220\n It's because the forests weren't managed\n\n2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:26.860\n like they had been in the first part of the 20th century.\n\n2:47:28.140 --> 2:47:31.100\n Just, I would say corruption at all levels,\n\n2:47:31.100 --> 2:47:32.260\n especially up to the governor,\n\n2:47:32.260 --> 2:47:34.460\n who famously was eating at the French Laundry\n\n2:47:34.460 --> 2:47:36.740\n and claimed that the outside was inside.\n\n2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:39.540\n And they wore masks off and it was great.\n\n2:47:39.540 --> 2:47:42.300\n Do what I say, not what I do.\n\n2:47:42.300 --> 2:47:45.380\n Rules for thee, but not for me.\n\n2:47:45.380 --> 2:47:47.580\n When you see that in leadership,\n\n2:47:47.580 --> 2:47:50.400\n people either run or they get rid of the leadership.\n\n2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:51.420\n So there's a recall drive,\n\n2:47:51.420 --> 2:47:53.500\n which is about to reach the threshold.\n\n2:47:53.500 --> 2:47:56.140\n Or in the old days, they get their guns, right?\n\n2:47:56.140 --> 2:47:57.580\n You don't put up with this junk.\n\n2:47:57.580 --> 2:48:00.700\n But ultimately, the thing that made Silicon Valley\n\n2:48:00.700 --> 2:48:04.600\n a special place, it gave freedom to young kids,\n\n2:48:04.600 --> 2:48:08.100\n entrepreneurs, young minds, brave minds\n\n2:48:08.100 --> 2:48:10.820\n to think bold, to try different stuff.\n\n2:48:10.820 --> 2:48:12.940\n I mean, even if the taxes are high,\n\n2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:15.540\n so outside of financial stuff, outside of all of that.\n\n2:48:15.540 --> 2:48:16.980\n Housing's super expensive.\n\n2:48:16.980 --> 2:48:17.820\n Housing's super.\n\n2:48:17.820 --> 2:48:18.820\n So it's hard.\n\n2:48:18.820 --> 2:48:19.660\n Okay, everything about startups is hard.\n\n2:48:19.660 --> 2:48:22.820\n Peninsula was narrow and they didn't plan the roads, right?\n\n2:48:22.820 --> 2:48:23.660\n Yeah.\n\n2:48:23.660 --> 2:48:26.020\n They got rid of public transportation in LA,\n\n2:48:26.020 --> 2:48:28.260\n like the Who Framed Roger Rabbit cartoon show.\n\n2:48:28.260 --> 2:48:30.860\n They used to have trolley cars in Portland too.\n\n2:48:30.860 --> 2:48:34.300\n The oil companies and the DOD conspired to build highways\n\n2:48:34.300 --> 2:48:35.660\n and make cars dominant.\n\n2:48:35.660 --> 2:48:37.420\n And the rights of way are long gone.\n\n2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:39.740\n Like Elon's gonna go underground.\n\n2:48:39.740 --> 2:48:40.740\n And I wish him well.\n\n2:48:40.740 --> 2:48:42.780\n That's probably the only way to do it now.\n\n2:48:42.780 --> 2:48:44.820\n But is it still a place,\n\n2:48:44.820 --> 2:48:46.500\n do you think it's possible that Silicon Valley\n\n2:48:46.500 --> 2:48:48.180\n is still a place where magic happens?\n\n2:48:48.180 --> 2:48:49.500\n Where the next Google's built?\n\n2:48:49.500 --> 2:48:53.580\n Where the next, I mean, Brave is built where?\n\n2:48:53.580 --> 2:48:54.900\n I think all good things come to an end.\n\n2:48:54.900 --> 2:48:56.660\n I think the problem is Silicon Valley\n\n2:48:56.660 --> 2:48:58.820\n had strong network effects through Stanford,\n\n2:48:58.820 --> 2:49:02.300\n through the angel investor networks and the wealth effect.\n\n2:49:02.300 --> 2:49:05.220\n And originally you have to give the federal government credit\n\n2:49:05.220 --> 2:49:07.300\n like the ARPANET was a government project.\n\n2:49:07.300 --> 2:49:08.140\n Let's not kid ourselves.\n\n2:49:08.140 --> 2:49:11.180\n This wasn't wild free market, libertarian capitalism.\n\n2:49:11.180 --> 2:49:12.780\n This was all Cold War stuff.\n\n2:49:14.020 --> 2:49:17.060\n You had out of the academia, you had Shockley\n\n2:49:17.060 --> 2:49:20.140\n and then the Traders Aid and Fairchild and Intel.\n\n2:49:21.060 --> 2:49:25.040\n But now, when's the last fab that was built in the Valley?\n\n2:49:25.040 --> 2:49:26.880\n MicroUnity might've been the last, I don't know.\n\n2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:27.720\n I haven't followed.\n\n2:49:27.720 --> 2:49:31.340\n We built a fab in Sunnyvale and MicroUnity\n\n2:49:31.340 --> 2:49:33.300\n in starting early 90s.\n\n2:49:33.300 --> 2:49:35.580\n And now the fabs are overseas.\n\n2:49:36.600 --> 2:49:38.820\n And the one thing that I would say\n\n2:49:38.820 --> 2:49:40.640\n that the oligarchs have intentionally done\n\n2:49:40.640 --> 2:49:44.220\n in both parties is sort of labor\n\n2:49:44.220 --> 2:49:46.180\n and environmental protection law arbitrage\n\n2:49:46.180 --> 2:49:47.580\n by going where the labor is cheaper\n\n2:49:47.580 --> 2:49:49.460\n and the environmental laws aren't as strict.\n\n2:49:49.460 --> 2:49:52.020\n And that's polluted the hell out of parts of China,\n\n2:49:52.020 --> 2:49:54.940\n but it's made things, you can make cheaper junk.\n\n2:49:54.940 --> 2:49:58.900\n And this is not a story that's over yet.\n\n2:49:58.900 --> 2:50:00.740\n So what is Silicon Valley for now?\n\n2:50:00.740 --> 2:50:03.300\n It's for the network effect, the brain trust\n\n2:50:03.300 --> 2:50:08.300\n of who you know, the parties, the Stanford sort of network.\n\n2:50:09.500 --> 2:50:11.860\n That's fragile too over time, I'm afraid.\n\n2:50:11.860 --> 2:50:16.100\n Stanford, a lot of good professors are like,\n\n2:50:16.100 --> 2:50:19.900\n they still filter mainly based on socioeconomic status,\n\n2:50:19.900 --> 2:50:22.180\n but it's kind of a skate school.\n\n2:50:22.180 --> 2:50:26.980\n I had a friend hired out of Harvard 20 years ago at Netscape\n\n2:50:26.980 --> 2:50:28.860\n and we talked about Harvard and he said,\n\n2:50:28.860 --> 2:50:30.700\n yeah, there's still professors who do great on the curve.\n\n2:50:30.700 --> 2:50:32.340\n And I said, oh yeah, I don't think they're any doing that\n\n2:50:32.340 --> 2:50:33.180\n at Stanford anymore.\n\n2:50:33.180 --> 2:50:35.100\n And he said, yo, it was shocking.\n\n2:50:35.100 --> 2:50:37.700\n Some of the students got Cs and Ds and they were crying.\n\n2:50:37.700 --> 2:50:39.620\n It's like, yes, that's right, the precious deers\n\n2:50:39.620 --> 2:50:42.420\n can't take that at Stanford, so they get As and Bs.\n\n2:50:42.420 --> 2:50:46.260\n Now you look at China and people say what you all about China,\n\n2:50:46.260 --> 2:50:49.700\n they prove Russia too, a lot of math science training,\n\n2:50:49.700 --> 2:50:52.540\n a lot of engineering, a lot of people who are doing\n\n2:50:52.540 --> 2:50:55.220\n their coursework to get the As and the Bs.\n\n2:50:55.220 --> 2:50:59.940\n So I'm an American, I'm born on the 4th of July.\n\n2:50:59.940 --> 2:51:00.780\n American, yeah.\n\n2:51:00.780 --> 2:51:02.100\n 4th of July, wow.\n\n2:51:02.100 --> 2:51:03.940\n And America, as I say, fundamentally\n\n2:51:03.940 --> 2:51:04.860\n is a commercial republic.\n\n2:51:04.860 --> 2:51:06.340\n You can try to make it something else.\n\n2:51:06.340 --> 2:51:09.020\n You can say it's the new Atlantis and mystify it.\n\n2:51:09.020 --> 2:51:11.260\n You could talk about it in a more, I think, correct way,\n\n2:51:11.260 --> 2:51:13.780\n which is 13 colonies that grew and then there's a lot\n\n2:51:13.780 --> 2:51:16.740\n of local or original design anyway,\n\n2:51:16.740 --> 2:51:18.820\n the federalist papers talk about this,\n\n2:51:18.820 --> 2:51:20.660\n there's a lot of subsidiarity,\n\n2:51:20.660 --> 2:51:23.940\n but that's been eroded over time.\n\n2:51:23.940 --> 2:51:26.660\n And like I say, a lot of the offshoring is hurt.\n\n2:51:26.660 --> 2:51:28.860\n So what happened with coronavirus?\n\n2:51:28.860 --> 2:51:30.940\n People working from home, and at first it was funny\n\n2:51:30.940 --> 2:51:33.540\n because I have friends at Google who used to grumble\n\n2:51:33.540 --> 2:51:35.420\n that not only did they have to come into the office,\n\n2:51:35.420 --> 2:51:37.340\n if they joined a different team that was centered\n\n2:51:37.340 --> 2:51:39.100\n in a different office, they had to move.\n\n2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:43.060\n Or if the VA team was reconstituted in Munich,\n\n2:51:43.060 --> 2:51:46.700\n which it was after Lars Bock just got tired of JavaScript,\n\n2:51:46.700 --> 2:51:48.780\n that they hired in Munich or they hired PhDs\n\n2:51:48.780 --> 2:51:50.780\n in Germany and moved them to Munich.\n\n2:51:50.780 --> 2:51:52.300\n With coronavirus, everyone's working from home\n\n2:51:52.300 --> 2:51:53.940\n and it's like, what a relief, I can work for Google\n\n2:51:53.940 --> 2:51:54.820\n from home.\n\n2:51:54.820 --> 2:51:57.220\n But then the next shoe dropped and people started asking\n\n2:51:57.220 --> 2:52:00.460\n Mark Zuckerberg, hey, can I move to my hometown\n\n2:52:00.460 --> 2:52:01.580\n in the Midwest?\n\n2:52:01.580 --> 2:52:02.420\n And he said, okay.\n\n2:52:02.420 --> 2:52:05.100\n And they said, oh, can I keep getting my Silicon Valley pay?\n\n2:52:05.100 --> 2:52:06.660\n No.\n\n2:52:06.660 --> 2:52:08.500\n We're gonna figure out what your cost of living there is\n\n2:52:08.500 --> 2:52:10.300\n and we're gonna adjust your pay accordingly.\n\n2:52:10.300 --> 2:52:13.020\n And these colonies and these little mini experiments\n\n2:52:13.020 --> 2:52:15.140\n that all combine to the big giant experiment,\n\n2:52:15.140 --> 2:52:20.060\n I have a, I don't know, I have this vision of America,\n\n2:52:20.060 --> 2:52:22.180\n which the country, I was born in Russia, like I said here,\n\n2:52:22.180 --> 2:52:24.980\n and this is truly a wonderful country.\n\n2:52:24.980 --> 2:52:27.500\n I wasn't born on the 4th of July, but I might as well be.\n\n2:52:27.500 --> 2:52:28.340\n People still flee here.\n\n2:52:28.340 --> 2:52:31.740\n I still, and I'm a red blooded American at this point.\n\n2:52:31.740 --> 2:52:35.420\n And I have a sense that we figured it out somehow.\n\n2:52:35.420 --> 2:52:37.940\n If Silicon Valley burns, another place will come up\n\n2:52:37.940 --> 2:52:42.020\n in this place that even more innovation and people will move\n\n2:52:42.020 --> 2:52:46.460\n and the remote work might change fundamentally how we work\n\n2:52:46.460 --> 2:52:47.300\n or it might not.\n\n2:52:47.300 --> 2:52:49.540\n It might just give you the freedom to then create\n\n2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:52.220\n many other small Silicon Valleys throughout the place,\n\n2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:54.940\n like Austin included, but other places as well.\n\n2:52:54.940 --> 2:52:58.540\n And we somehow figured it out and...\n\n2:52:58.540 --> 2:53:01.660\n I think that's true that there will be more mobility\n\n2:53:01.660 --> 2:53:03.460\n and maybe new places that come up.\n\n2:53:03.460 --> 2:53:07.940\n I don't know if Silicon Valley has passed some sell by date\n\n2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:10.820\n because it did hurt.\n\n2:53:10.820 --> 2:53:13.420\n The coronavirus hurt, the lockdowns hurt in the sense\n\n2:53:13.420 --> 2:53:15.860\n that part of what keeps things going is social.\n\n2:53:15.860 --> 2:53:18.300\n And so a lot of young people, even before coronavirus,\n\n2:53:18.300 --> 2:53:19.660\n moved to San Francisco.\n\n2:53:19.660 --> 2:53:21.660\n It was very strange to watch because in the 80s,\n\n2:53:21.660 --> 2:53:24.860\n we all lived in the Valley and it was less populated\n\n2:53:24.860 --> 2:53:26.060\n and San Francisco was grungier.\n\n2:53:26.060 --> 2:53:28.620\n It was more like Dirty Harry in the 70s.\n\n2:53:28.620 --> 2:53:31.660\n But by the 90s, and Jamie runs a nightclub there\n\n2:53:31.660 --> 2:53:33.780\n and he's talked about this, you had sort of wealthy\n\n2:53:33.780 --> 2:53:36.100\n tech people moving in south of market,\n\n2:53:36.100 --> 2:53:37.780\n fancy townhouses being built.\n\n2:53:37.780 --> 2:53:41.020\n And that's continued in such a point that it's almost like,\n\n2:53:41.020 --> 2:53:43.540\n what's the movie by the South African director Nils Jody\n\n2:53:43.540 --> 2:53:46.020\n Foster up in the space colony?\n\n2:53:46.020 --> 2:53:48.180\n Matt Damon is the guy on the earth who has to go\n\n2:53:48.180 --> 2:53:50.540\n up and anyway, it's about the stratification.\n\n2:53:50.540 --> 2:53:52.060\n It's about the great inequality that people\n\n2:53:52.060 --> 2:53:55.540\n in the space station have like amazing medical auto docs\n\n2:53:55.540 --> 2:53:57.940\n that can extend their life or save them cure cancer.\n\n2:53:57.940 --> 2:54:01.340\n People on earth are all suffering ground down in poverty.\n\n2:54:02.820 --> 2:54:06.260\n And that sort of happened while I was here.\n\n2:54:06.260 --> 2:54:10.660\n You saw a lot of money drive prices up\n\n2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:12.540\n along the narrow peninsula and the single people\n\n2:54:12.540 --> 2:54:14.540\n wanted nightlife so they were in the city\n\n2:54:14.540 --> 2:54:16.700\n and the condos in the city got super expensive.\n\n2:54:16.700 --> 2:54:20.660\n And I know even Google friends who are socially responsible\n\n2:54:20.660 --> 2:54:22.820\n say we should have more housing built.\n\n2:54:22.820 --> 2:54:25.860\n We should have yes in my backyard, not in my backyard.\n\n2:54:25.860 --> 2:54:28.460\n But that's not happening as far as I can tell.\n\n2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:32.540\n And from the government to the incumbent landowners\n\n2:54:32.540 --> 2:54:34.500\n and renters, it's just not happening.\n\n2:54:34.500 --> 2:54:37.500\n And that has to drive people away.\n\n2:54:37.500 --> 2:54:40.500\n I appreciate that people come here and you should wait\n\n2:54:40.500 --> 2:54:42.620\n for the prices to moderate, they will.\n\n2:54:42.620 --> 2:54:47.360\n But a lot of people are gonna go where the prices are lower.\n\n2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:50.340\n You, and sorry for silly questions here,\n\n2:54:50.340 --> 2:54:54.380\n but just looking back, you have created things,\n\n2:54:54.380 --> 2:54:56.540\n have been part of creating things\n\n2:54:56.540 --> 2:55:00.740\n that have transformed this world, the world of technology,\n\n2:55:00.740 --> 2:55:02.740\n perhaps more than almost anything else.\n\n2:55:04.820 --> 2:55:07.580\n But you're still a human being\n\n2:55:07.580 --> 2:55:10.900\n and unfortunately this ride ends.\n\n2:55:10.900 --> 2:55:13.780\n Do you ever think about your own mortality?\n\n2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:17.460\n Not too much, I mean, I'm a Roman Catholic\n\n2:55:17.460 --> 2:55:19.220\n so I am not afraid of death.\n\n2:55:19.220 --> 2:55:24.220\n I think a lot of people who have problems with death\n\n2:55:25.140 --> 2:55:30.140\n are suffering from some lack of either faith\n\n2:55:30.700 --> 2:55:33.380\n in their transcending death or maybe they don't have\n\n2:55:33.380 --> 2:55:37.260\n children or they feel like they get later in life\n\n2:55:37.260 --> 2:55:39.220\n and they feel like they've missed opportunities\n\n2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:40.620\n to do something that endures.\n\n2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:43.540\n And I sympathize with a lot because I'm old,\n\n2:55:43.540 --> 2:55:46.440\n I got married fairly old, so I understand all that.\n\n2:55:46.440 --> 2:55:49.360\n Nothing human is alien to me as Terrence said.\n\n2:55:50.820 --> 2:55:54.100\n But I don't fear it, no.\n\n2:55:54.100 --> 2:55:56.300\n What do you hope your legacy is?\n\n2:55:56.300 --> 2:55:57.740\n Yeah, it's gonna be JavaScript.\n\n2:55:57.740 --> 2:56:01.100\n I think, no, I think my legacy has more to do\n\n2:56:01.100 --> 2:56:03.540\n with my children and their children.\n\n2:56:03.540 --> 2:56:06.460\n I think it also has to do with web standards,\n\n2:56:06.460 --> 2:56:08.340\n it has to do with things like Brave,\n\n2:56:08.340 --> 2:56:10.060\n the things we did with Firefox.\n\n2:56:10.060 --> 2:56:13.100\n When we did, I'm not gonna oversell Brave\n\n2:56:13.100 --> 2:56:15.140\n but I think Brave is important and we'll continue\n\n2:56:15.140 --> 2:56:16.780\n to prove this in a way that counts\n\n2:56:16.780 --> 2:56:18.120\n for many decades to come.\n\n2:56:18.120 --> 2:56:21.420\n But even Firefox, whatever its future fortune,\n\n2:56:21.420 --> 2:56:23.300\n showed you can restart the browser market.\n\n2:56:23.300 --> 2:56:26.180\n This thing you said about people opting out\n\n2:56:26.180 --> 2:56:28.600\n and routing around, you don't need everybody to do that.\n\n2:56:28.600 --> 2:56:31.220\n It's more like Taleb's stubborn minorities that do that.\n\n2:56:31.220 --> 2:56:33.640\n It's the lead users, Erfron Hipple's lead users.\n\n2:56:33.640 --> 2:56:36.100\n You can be a few percent, you can tilt the market.\n\n2:56:36.100 --> 2:56:39.380\n And that can be done in spite of the incumbents,\n\n2:56:39.380 --> 2:56:41.540\n of moneyed interests not being in favor of what you're doing.\n\n2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:45.260\n So I think what we do with Firefox won't be forgotten\n\n2:56:45.260 --> 2:56:47.140\n and it needs to be done more and we're doing it with Brave.\n\n2:56:47.140 --> 2:56:48.780\n And you could argue that other projects are doing it.\n\n2:56:48.780 --> 2:56:50.780\n In some ways, blockchain is doing it.\n\n2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:55.780\n The Robinhood, take down the use of Robinhood\n\n2:56:56.100 --> 2:56:59.100\n by the Wall Street Bets kids, similar.\n\n2:56:59.100 --> 2:57:01.300\n So yeah, that kind of spirit endures.\n\n2:57:01.300 --> 2:57:04.180\n And I think it, in some ways it's American, right?\n\n2:57:04.180 --> 2:57:06.540\n It's not hard revolutionary.\n\n2:57:06.540 --> 2:57:08.780\n It's not trying to burn the past and destroy everything.\n\n2:57:08.780 --> 2:57:13.780\n It's more like we have these certain, let's say rights.\n\n2:57:15.140 --> 2:57:16.180\n We have duties too.\n\n2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:17.780\n So there's some debate about which comes first\n\n2:57:17.780 --> 2:57:20.360\n in American jurisprudence and the founding documents.\n\n2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:23.020\n But as long as things are working,\n\n2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:25.900\n we'll be like pragmatic Americans,\n\n2:57:25.900 --> 2:57:29.300\n like de Tocqueville described in his writings.\n\n2:57:29.300 --> 2:57:32.620\n But if things get too out of whack for one reason or another,\n\n2:57:32.620 --> 2:57:35.540\n too unequal, too oligarchic and abusive,\n\n2:57:35.540 --> 2:57:37.060\n we're gonna start our rights.\n\n2:57:37.060 --> 2:57:38.860\n And even a few of us can do it.\n\n2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:40.460\n And even in the American Revolution,\n\n2:57:40.460 --> 2:57:44.100\n it was the minority who fought and put their lives,\n\n2:57:44.100 --> 2:57:45.620\n treasure and sacred honor at stake.\n\n2:57:45.620 --> 2:57:48.860\n It was a bunch of people went to upper Canada,\n\n2:57:48.860 --> 2:57:51.140\n I think it was called, Ontario.\n\n2:57:51.140 --> 2:57:52.860\n Yeah, that's the beautiful, I mean,\n\n2:57:52.860 --> 2:57:55.100\n that is at the core where your work stands for\n\n2:57:55.100 --> 2:57:58.180\n is that a few people can have the power\n\n2:57:58.180 --> 2:58:01.580\n to transform society with just a few radical ideas,\n\n2:58:01.580 --> 2:58:04.580\n with just a little bit of code, change the world.\n\n2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:05.420\n Gotta do it.\n\n2:58:05.420 --> 2:58:06.240\n And that's empowering.\n\n2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:07.220\n That is the American way.\n\n2:58:07.220 --> 2:58:09.380\n That's why this country is, I believe,\n\n2:58:09.380 --> 2:58:10.460\n the greatest country on Earth.\n\n2:58:10.460 --> 2:58:13.040\n That's not over, or Matt says it too much,\n\n2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:15.900\n but I think some special things\n\n2:58:15.900 --> 2:58:17.580\n have already happened in this country\n\n2:58:17.580 --> 2:58:18.800\n and will continue to happen.\n\n2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:19.640\n And that's really exciting.\n\n2:58:19.640 --> 2:58:22.520\n And that spirit can continue no matter who comes here.\n\n2:58:22.520 --> 2:58:25.520\n They can adopt those folkways and that spirit.\n\n2:58:25.520 --> 2:58:27.580\n Brandon, I can't tell you how much,\n\n2:58:27.580 --> 2:58:29.540\n I was freaking out how much of an honor it is\n\n2:58:29.540 --> 2:58:30.380\n to talk to you.\n\n2:58:30.380 --> 2:58:31.420\n You're an incredible human being.\n\n2:58:31.420 --> 2:58:33.580\n It's one of my favorite conversations ever.\n\n2:58:33.580 --> 2:58:35.660\n Thank you so much for wasting all this time with me.\n\n2:58:35.660 --> 2:58:36.580\n I really appreciate it.\n\n2:58:36.580 --> 2:58:38.060\n Oh, it seems like a breeze.\n\n2:58:38.060 --> 2:58:38.880\n My pleasure.\n\n2:58:39.740 --> 2:58:41.380\n Thank you for listening to this conversation\n\n2:58:41.380 --> 2:58:42.580\n with Brandon and Ike.\n\n2:58:42.580 --> 2:58:44.440\n And thank you to our sponsors,\n\n2:58:44.440 -->
