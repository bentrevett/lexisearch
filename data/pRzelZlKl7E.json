publish this conversation\n\n00:06.640 --> 00:10.000\n as part of this podcast, but as a separate thing.\n\n00:10.000 --> 00:13.600\n And as a result, it did not receive many listens.\n\n00:13.600 --> 00:16.680\n Let me be honest and say that while I usually\n\n00:16.680 --> 00:19.840\n don't care about how many listens or views something gets,\n\n00:19.840 --> 00:23.580\n in this one case, I feel like I failed one of my heroes.\n\n00:23.580 --> 00:25.280\n I feel I didn't properly introduce\n\n00:25.280 --> 00:28.260\n a truly special human being to an audience\n\n00:28.260 --> 00:31.400\n that might find him as inspiring as I did.\n\n00:31.400 --> 00:33.980\n Dan Gable is one of the greatest\n\n00:33.980 --> 00:36.300\n Olympic athletes of all time.\n\n00:36.300 --> 00:39.320\n Bigger than records and medals, to many like myself,\n\n00:39.320 --> 00:43.320\n he's a symbol of guts, spirit, mental toughness,\n\n00:43.320 --> 00:45.420\n and relentless hard work.\n\n00:45.420 --> 00:48.180\n As a wrestler, he was undefeated in high school,\n\n00:48.180 --> 00:51.600\n undefeated in college until his very last match.\n\n00:51.600 --> 00:55.560\n And having lost that match, he found another level\n\n00:55.560 --> 00:58.800\n and became a world champion and an Olympic champion.\n\n00:58.800 --> 01:01.040\n And most importantly, he did so\n\n01:01.040 --> 01:03.440\n perfectly dominating his opponents.\n\n01:03.440 --> 01:05.200\n He did not surrender a single point\n\n01:05.200 --> 01:07.800\n at the 1972 Olympic games.\n\n01:07.800 --> 01:12.360\n As a coach, he led the Iowa Hawkeyes to 15 national titles\n\n01:12.360 --> 01:15.040\n and 25 consecutive Big Ten championships.\n\n01:15.040 --> 01:19.840\n He coached 152 All Americans, 45 national champions,\n\n01:19.840 --> 01:23.320\n 106 Big Ten champions, and 12 Olympians,\n\n01:23.320 --> 01:25.280\n including eight medalists.\n\n01:25.280 --> 01:26.960\n He's the author of several books,\n\n01:26.960 --> 01:29.840\n including A Wrestling Life One and Two,\n\n01:29.840 --> 01:32.580\n and Coaching Wrestling Successfully.\n\n01:32.580 --> 01:34.280\n Quick mention of our sponsors.\n\n01:34.280 --> 01:38.100\n Trial Labs, a machine learning company, ExpressVPN,\n\n01:38.100 --> 01:40.780\n Grammarly writing helper tool,\n\n01:40.780 --> 01:43.200\n and Simply Safe Home Security.\n\n01:43.200 --> 01:47.780\n So the choice is AI, privacy, grammar, or safety.\n\n01:47.780 --> 01:49.240\n Choose wisely, my friends.\n\n01:49.240 --> 01:51.820\n And if you wish, click the

02:00.320\n and got to attend a wrestling duel meet\n\n02:00.320 --> 02:02.860\n in the historic Carver Hawkeye Arena.\n\n02:02.860 --> 02:05.480\n Part of me wanted to stay in Iowa forever\n\n02:05.480 --> 02:10.140\n to drill takedowns, to start a family, to live life simply.\n\n02:10.140 --> 02:12.520\n Wrestling is one of the pure sports,\n\n02:12.520 --> 02:14.920\n both beautiful and brutal,\n\n02:14.920 --> 02:17.640\n where both mental toughness and technical mastery\n\n02:17.640 --> 02:21.040\n of the highest form are rewarded with victory,\n\n02:21.040 --> 02:23.960\n and everything else is punished with defeat.\n\n02:23.960 --> 02:26.120\n And every such loss weighs heavy on the minds\n\n02:26.120 --> 02:29.240\n of anyone who has ever stepped on the wrestling mat,\n\n02:29.240 --> 02:31.000\n including myself.\n\n02:31.000 --> 02:33.920\n The same is true for one of the greatest wrestlers\n\n02:33.920 --> 02:35.400\n in history of the sport,\n\n02:35.400 --> 02:38.200\n the man who graciously welcomed me into his home\n\n02:38.200 --> 02:42.120\n for this conversation, the legend, Dan Gable.\n\n02:42.120 --> 02:44.440\n If you

that,\n\n02:58.320 --> 02:59.920\n because you've been trying to get me on this podcast\n\n02:59.920 --> 03:01.280\n for a long time.\n\n03:01.280 --> 03:04.920\n And until I saw you on another podcast\n\n03:04.920 --> 03:08.440\n and you said you were Russian, did I call you back?\n\n03:08.440 --> 03:09.400\n Then it was over.\n\n03:09.400 --> 03:11.080\n Because Russia to me, you know,\n\n03:11.080 --> 03:14.920\n is leading the world in wrestling almost every year.\n\n03:14.920 --> 03:16.560\n What's the difference between American wrestling\n\n03:16.560 --> 03:17.400\n and Russian wrestling?\n\n03:17.400 --> 03:18.600\n You showed me this painting.\n\n03:18.600 --> 03:20.640\n Well, it's MIT, it's science.\n\n03:20.640 --> 03:21.480\n It's science.\n\n03:21.480 --> 03:24.840\n And they really study the sport.\n\n03:24.840 --> 03:26.120\n They're really good technically.\n\n03:26.120 --> 03:28.680\n They're really, really good in strategy.\n\n03:28.680 --> 03:32.120\n They don't really push like the real toughness.\n\n03:32.120 --> 03:35.440\n They don't push like conditioning.\n\n03:35.440 --> 03:38.760\n And so Americans, we need what they have.\n\n03:38.760 --> 03:40.880\n Russians need what we have.\n\n03:40.880 --> 03:43.680\n And when you get the two together.\n\n03:43.680 --> 03:46.560\n And for me, why I could beat the Russians\n\n03:46.560 --> 03:50.160\n is because I went their way a little bit.\n\n03:50.160 --> 03:52.600\n But I kept my toughness.\n\n03:52.600 --> 03:56.080\n But you're known, you're known for your toughness.\n\n03:56.080 --> 03:57.880\n Yeah, but I wasn't known for my art.\n\n03:59.040 --> 04:00.960\n I wasn't known for my science.\n\n04:00.960 --> 04:02.960\n So when did you become a bit of an artist?\n\n04:02.960 --> 04:04.720\n It took a loss.\n\n04:04.720 --> 04:05.560\n The Larry Owens loss.\n\n04:05.560 --> 04:07.680\n Most people thought I was already an artist\n\n04:07.680 --> 04:11.440\n just because I won 181 straight matches in seven years.\n\n04:11.440 --> 04:13.160\n And not just winning, but you know,\n\n04:13.160 --> 04:16.040\n kind of punishing people.\n\n04:16.040 --> 04:17.960\n And from that point of view,\n\n04:17.960 --> 04:19.240\n yeah, I might've been pretty good,\n\n04:19.240 --> 04:21.280\n but I had a long ways to go yet.\n\n04:21.280 --> 04:23.640\n And I didn't really realize that,\n\n04:23.640 --> 04:27.080\n or I should say, I didn't really know\n\n04:27.080 --> 04:29.280\n how to get it out of me until I had a loss.\n\n04:29.280 --> 04:31.480\n And then I realized I gotta buckle down,\n\n04:31.480 --> 04:34.480\n learn some of that science, become more of an artist.\n\n04:34.480 --> 04:35.520\n How do you become an artist?\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:40.520\n So the Russian way has this drilling technique,\n\n04:41.320 --> 04:42.720\n thousands of reps.\n\n04:42.720 --> 04:46.680\n How do you think you work on the science, the art part?\n\n04:46.680 --> 04:49.800\n You gotta study the best in the world.\n\n04:49.800 --> 04:53.360\n I think Dave Schultz was our guy in America\n\n04:53.360 --> 04:58.360\n that probably showed us that being artistic,\n\n04:58.440 --> 04:59.440\n you needed that.\n\n04:59.440 --> 05:00.400\n And he studied it.\n\n05:00.400 --> 05:02.600\n He went over there as a high schooler\n\n05:02.600 --> 05:04.920\n and rustled in some major tournaments over there.\n\n05:04.920 --> 05:07.160\n And he saw their ways.\n\n05:08.160 --> 05:09.920\n He used that Russian science\n\n05:09.920 --> 05:12.680\n and then he was already an American\n\n05:12.680 --> 05:15.960\n and he saw how I trained athletes.\n\n05:15.960 --> 05:17.680\n He saw what I did in the Olympics,\n\n05:17.680 --> 05:20.320\n saw what other people, how we held up,\n\n05:20.320 --> 05:21.880\n and he applied that as well.\n\n05:21.880 --> 05:25.120\n But I'd have to say he was more the artistic type.\n\n05:25.120 --> 05:27.120\n He was more of a Russian than an American\n\n05:27.120 --> 05:30.480\n when it came to wrestling.\n\n05:30.480 --> 05:33.280\n You've coached 45 national champions,\n\n05:33.280 --> 05:37.760\n 106 Big Ten champions, and eight Olympic medalists,\n\n05:37.760 --> 05:39.560\n which is incredible.\n\n05:39.560 --> 05:42.640\n What is a common thread between them\n\n05:42.640 --> 05:46.520\n and what are maybe some of the fundamental differences?\n\n05:47.440 --> 05:50.480\n I think the common thread is that\n\n05:53.640 --> 05:56.280\n they all had one of those two avenues\n\n05:56.280 --> 05:57.480\n that we talked already\n\n05:59.040 --> 06:02.120\n and because we intertwined them.\n\n06:02.120 --> 06:05.360\n So in a Russian wrestling room, they got the same people.\n\n06:05.360 --> 06:07.080\n Most of the time in an American wrestling room,\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:08.520\n we had the same people.\n\n06:08.520 --> 06:10.600\n But when I was out recruiting,\n\n06:10.600 --> 06:13.040\n at first I recruited just attitude,\n\n06:15.080 --> 06:16.800\n but I needed more than that.\n\n06:16.800 --> 06:21.360\n I needed some genetics in that wrestling room\n\n06:21.360 --> 06:25.480\n to actually, that hard work people,\n\n06:25.480 --> 06:29.240\n they could look and see, wow,\n\n06:29.240 --> 06:32.800\n that execution, that's unbelievable.\n\n06:32.800 --> 06:37.360\n But yet I can beat that guy after the first minute.\n\n06:37.360 --> 06:42.360\n So you think the art, the technique is genetics.\n\n06:42.600 --> 06:43.760\n You're born with it.\n\n06:43.760 --> 06:44.600\n You think it's not something.\n\n06:44.600 --> 06:48.440\n I think your pop and your ability to move.\n\n06:48.440 --> 06:49.280\n Timing.\n\n06:49.280 --> 06:53.520\n And timing and your quickness and your strength.\n\n06:53.520 --> 06:58.200\n The Russians, they usually picked out\n\n06:59.200 --> 07:01.760\n the people that can go into that sport.\n\n07:01.760 --> 07:04.120\n That was the old fashioned sports school.\n\n07:04.120 --> 07:07.920\n But it's mostly like when you walk into a Russian\n\n07:07.920 --> 07:12.200\n wrestling room, you see them hitting skills, techniques.\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:15.480\n You don't see them banging against each other that much.\n\n07:15.480 --> 07:17.120\n But then when practice is over,\n\n07:17.120 --> 07:18.920\n you might not see a bunch of sprints.\n\n07:18.920 --> 07:22.760\n You might see them walk over to the ropes\n\n07:22.760 --> 07:25.160\n and they drop down from the ceiling\n\n07:25.160 --> 07:28.160\n and they'll jump up and climb a rope, boom, boom, boom.\n\n07:28.160 --> 07:30.680\n And then they come down and then they don't jump\n\n07:30.680 --> 07:31.680\n right back on.\n\n07:31.680 --> 07:33.320\n They have three or four other guys go\n\n07:33.320 --> 07:34.760\n and then they jump back on.\n\n07:34.760 --> 07:38.040\n Whereas I probably made my guys climb them,\n\n07:38.040 --> 07:40.920\n get right back down, climb them right back again.\n\n07:40.920 --> 07:45.920\n But I also realized that I had to have a mix of that.\n\n07:46.720 --> 07:47.560\n What was the role?\n\n07:47.560 --> 07:48.520\n What was your role?\n\n07:48.520 --> 07:51.080\n I mean, those guys looked up and Dan Gable\n\n07:51.080 --> 07:53.600\n and what was the role in helping these athletes\n\n07:53.600 --> 07:54.760\n become their best?\n\n07:54.760 --> 07:55.600\n These national champions.\n\n07:55.600 --> 07:57.920\n Well, you had to first of all prove that you were,\n\n07:58.920 --> 08:00.360\n knew what you were doing.\n\n08:00.360 --> 08:02.400\n In terms of technique or in terms of hard work?\n\n08:02.400 --> 08:03.560\n Everything, everything.\n\n08:03.560 --> 08:05.640\n They just, you had to be the first guy there\n\n08:05.640 --> 08:06.560\n and the last guy to leave\n\n08:06.560 --> 08:08.400\n and you had to be the most dedicated guy,\n\n08:08.400 --> 08:10.160\n even though they were the ones that's trying to\n\n08:10.160 --> 08:11.960\n win the championships.\n\n08:11.960 --> 08:14.440\n You had to prove that you were gonna work just as hard\n\n08:14.440 --> 08:15.920\n as they were as a coach.\n\n08:15.920 --> 08:17.240\n And what does that look like?\n\n08:17.240 --> 08:20.120\n So you can see it when you, you know it when you see it?\n\n08:20.120 --> 08:22.200\n Well, you're there ahead of them\n\n08:22.200 --> 08:24.320\n and you're there after they leave.\n\n08:25.360 --> 08:26.760\n It's that simple.\n\n08:26.760 --> 08:29.880\n I'm picking up after them and you're analyzing them.\n\n08:29.880 --> 08:34.360\n You outwork them, you outwork them and you outthink them.\n\n08:34.360 --> 08:36.200\n And so, you know, use that type of strategy.\n\n08:36.200 --> 08:39.800\n And over time, when you prove it works,\n\n08:39.800 --> 08:43.720\n because some of my kids that were the best kids\n\n08:43.720 --> 08:48.720\n in the world really shouldn't have been a wrestler.\n\n08:49.560 --> 08:51.440\n I mean, they weren't very coordinated,\n\n08:53.000 --> 08:56.880\n but they worked so hard to develop themselves.\n\n08:56.880 --> 08:58.360\n What was your role in that process?\n\n08:58.360 --> 09:01.560\n I mean, that means pushing kids to their limit.\n\n09:01.560 --> 09:02.920\n If you're not...\n\n09:02.920 --> 09:04.640\n Yeah, but you can't push kids to their limit.\n\n09:04.640 --> 09:06.440\n And even when you push them to their limit,\n\n09:06.440 --> 09:07.760\n that's not their limit\n\n09:07.760 --> 09:09.600\n because their limit's above and beyond that.\n\n09:09.600 --> 09:14.040\n I mean, yeah, coaches sometimes accidentally don't,\n\n09:14.040 --> 09:16.760\n they lose kids because of the heat,\n\n09:16.760 --> 09:19.040\n because of hard work and all that.\n\n09:19.040 --> 09:22.640\n And you gotta know when to back off.\n\n09:22.640 --> 09:24.520\n You gotta read your athletes.\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:28.120\n And by that, I mean, you gotta know them pretty well.\n\n09:28.120 --> 09:30.080\n Every once in a while, you make a little bit of a mistake,\n\n09:30.080 --> 09:32.080\n but if you don't react right on that mistake\n\n09:32.080 --> 09:35.520\n before it gets too far, then it's gonna be a casualty.\n\n09:35.520 --> 09:38.000\n And I don't mean somebody dying necessarily,\n\n09:38.000 --> 09:40.800\n but maybe something that could turn them off\n\n09:40.800 --> 09:43.200\n or maybe something that could run them away\n\n09:43.200 --> 09:46.800\n or maybe something that, wow, that was close.\n\n09:46.800 --> 09:49.000\n Maybe shouldn't have pushed them that far.\n\n09:49.000 --> 09:51.600\n So you really have to be very educated.\n\n09:51.600 --> 09:54.600\n And it's not just what you know,\n\n09:54.600 --> 09:56.320\n it's what you know about them.\n\n09:56.320 --> 09:57.880\n And I'm not talking about the team.\n\n09:57.880 --> 09:59.280\n I'm talking about each guy on the team.\n\n09:59.280 --> 10:00.120\n Individuals, yeah.\n\n10:00.120 --> 10:01.320\n Yeah, each person on the team.\n\n10:01.320 --> 10:03.400\n And you know it how?\n\n10:03.400 --> 10:04.240\n You see it in their eyes?\n\n10:04.240 --> 10:06.880\n You know it how because you're the first one there\n\n10:06.880 --> 10:08.160\n and you're the last one to leave\n\n10:08.160 --> 10:10.700\n and you set in the environment with them.\n\n10:10.700 --> 10:13.240\n You're there in the morning for practice sometimes.\n\n10:13.240 --> 10:15.280\n You're there in the afternoon for two or three hours.\n\n10:15.280 --> 10:18.440\n After practice, you might have a hot room\n\n10:18.440 --> 10:21.680\n or you might have a sauna or a steam or a whirlpool\n\n10:21.680 --> 10:25.160\n and you get in there with them and you listen.\n\n10:25.160 --> 10:28.080\n You're not just feeding out information.\n\n10:28.080 --> 10:31.120\n You do that, but you're taking in a lot of that too.\n\n10:31.120 --> 10:33.720\n And I'm telling you, when you get in an atmosphere\n\n10:33.720 --> 10:36.560\n that they're relaxed and they feel comfortable,\n\n10:36.560 --> 10:38.600\n it's like a massage.\n\n10:38.600 --> 10:41.560\n And that's after practice in one of those areas\n\n10:41.560 --> 10:44.440\n that people are around you, you learn a lot.\n\n10:44.440 --> 10:46.480\n I mean, you got a lot to learn as a coach.\n\n10:46.480 --> 10:48.060\n And when you get in that atmosphere,\n\n10:48.060 --> 10:51.200\n when all of a sudden you feel like very comfortable,\n\n10:52.320 --> 10:54.240\n words start flowing.\n\n10:54.240 --> 10:59.240\n And when those words flow, you take them in as a coach.\n\n10:59.480 --> 11:02.280\n And there's something probably gonna be said\n\n11:02.280 --> 11:04.080\n that you can do and act upon\n\n11:04.080 --> 11:07.320\n that's gonna help certain situations.\n\n11:07.320 --> 11:09.880\n I've saved a couple of kids lives for sure\n\n11:09.880 --> 11:11.480\n that were on the brink.\n\n11:11.480 --> 11:14.120\n Sometimes performance is at such a high level\n\n11:14.120 --> 11:16.120\n in a high level atmosphere\n\n11:17.960 --> 11:21.520\n that life and death is actually involved.\n\n11:21.520 --> 11:24.480\n And I don't mean pushing a kid to where he just dies,\n\n11:24.480 --> 11:28.040\n but I mean, he might feel himself as a failure.\n\n11:28.040 --> 11:30.360\n He might go home and take his own life.\n\n11:30.360 --> 11:31.840\n Yeah, I mean, but that's part of it.\n\n11:31.840 --> 11:34.320\n You're putting so much heart,\n\n11:34.320 --> 11:36.080\n so much blood and heart and sweat\n\n11:36.080 --> 11:39.520\n and your whole meaning of life becomes winning.\n\n11:39.520 --> 11:43.600\n So, and sometimes it's so hard to lose within that context.\n\n11:43.600 --> 11:47.080\n So if in your, I think the first wrestling life\n\n11:47.080 --> 11:51.320\n you wrote about Chad Zapato who lost,\n\n11:51.320 --> 11:52.880\n I mean, incredible wrestler,\n\n11:52.880 --> 11:55.440\n but lost in three finals in the nationals\n\n11:55.440 --> 11:59.960\n and has this tattoo of a hawk clawing out the human heart.\n\n11:59.960 --> 12:03.200\n Yeah, so what lessons, is there any lessons\n\n12:03.200 --> 12:06.580\n from the incredible wrestling he's done,\n\n12:06.580 --> 12:09.280\n but also the incredible suffering that he went through\n\n12:10.320 --> 12:11.160\n on himself?\n\n12:11.160 --> 12:14.880\n Yeah, again, you like that word suffering, which is okay.\n\n12:14.880 --> 12:15.720\n Okay, so.\n\n12:15.720 --> 12:17.200\n No, no, no, no, no, keep it, keep it.\n\n12:17.200 --> 12:19.600\n Cause it fits right in where I want.\n\n12:19.600 --> 12:21.760\n I have to turn that suffering around\n\n12:22.720 --> 12:25.800\n to where he makes and feels good about himself\n\n12:25.800 --> 12:29.120\n or better, doesn't have to feel perfect.\n\n12:29.120 --> 12:31.360\n Cause he did lose, you know?\n\n12:31.360 --> 12:35.580\n And so, but you have to actually get him to realize\n\n12:35.580 --> 12:37.460\n that yeah, he's still unique\n\n12:37.460 --> 12:38.960\n compared to the walk of the earth.\n\n12:38.960 --> 12:41.880\n He was unbelievably unique right at the top,\n\n12:41.880 --> 12:43.640\n just a little bit short of,\n\n12:43.640 --> 12:48.080\n but because it was, you know, he felt the suffering,\n\n12:48.080 --> 12:50.680\n you now have to go about and change that\n\n12:50.680 --> 12:52.800\n and put it into goodwill some way.\n\n12:52.800 --> 12:55.580\n And because he's, you really have a lot of goodwill,\n\n12:55.580 --> 12:57.360\n you can do a lot of goodwill.\n\n12:57.360 --> 13:00.640\n And so, and it's not easy.\n\n13:00.640 --> 13:05.640\n It took him probably years, years of tattooing.\n\n13:05.800 --> 13:06.640\n Yeah.\n\n13:06.640 --> 13:08.400\n Years of covering the tattoos.\n\n13:09.600 --> 13:12.040\n And, you know, he told me he moved to,\n\n13:12.040 --> 13:13.440\n I go, why are you moving to California?\n\n13:13.440 --> 13:15.200\n Cause he was here for a couple of years\n\n13:15.200 --> 13:18.160\n after his wrestling was done, cause he had a good job\n\n13:18.160 --> 13:21.280\n around here and he was, I thought he was doing a good job,\n\n13:21.280 --> 13:24.960\n but he just, he said, I had to escape, you know?\n\n13:24.960 --> 13:26.880\n Yeah, it's the same as the covering up the tattoo.\n\n13:26.880 --> 13:28.160\n I had a wrestling terminology.\n\n13:28.160 --> 13:32.120\n I have to get, I hate to say this, I hate to say this.\n\n13:32.120 --> 13:33.800\n I go, where are you going?\n\n13:33.800 --> 13:35.600\n He said, I'm gonna go to California.\n\n13:37.000 --> 13:40.000\n And I go, is there any reason why you're going to California?\n\n13:40.000 --> 13:45.000\n And he says, that's where everybody goes to hide.\n\n13:48.720 --> 13:51.160\n But I said, I think you're wrong there,\n\n13:51.160 --> 13:55.060\n but you know, I think what will determine your life\n\n13:55.060 --> 13:57.400\n will be what you do from now on, you know?\n\n13:57.400 --> 14:00.200\n And if you can find, and he's actually turned it around.\n\n14:00.200 --> 14:01.400\n I mean, he's actually turned it around.\n\n14:01.400 --> 14:02.840\n You have to discover that yourself.\n\n14:02.840 --> 14:04.240\n Exactly, and he went someplace\n\n14:04.240 --> 14:08.980\n that he thought he could fit into, and I think he did.\n\n14:08.980 --> 14:11.640\n And I think he's got a good job, and he's helping people,\n\n14:11.640 --> 14:16.640\n and he covered that tattoo with feathers, another tattoo.\n\n14:18.440 --> 14:20.520\n Well, in the end, it's a beautiful story.\n\n14:20.520 --> 14:21.560\n Yeah, it is, it really is.\n\n14:21.560 --> 14:22.960\n Suffering and overcoming.\n\n14:22.960 --> 14:25.140\n Yeah, and he's not done yet.\n\n14:25.140 --> 14:25.980\n He's not done yet.\n\n14:25.980 --> 14:26.820\n No, he's not done.\n\n14:26.820 --> 14:29.840\n He's got a lot more to do.\n\n14:29.840 --> 14:32.560\n So you mentioned Roger Bannister,\n\n14:32.560 --> 14:34.640\n again, I think in your first book,\n\n14:34.640 --> 14:36.480\n and somebody you looked up to,\n\n14:36.480 --> 14:39.080\n that's the man who broke the four minute mile, right?\n\n14:40.080 --> 14:42.000\n When everybody said it was impossible,\n\n14:42.000 --> 14:43.400\n everyone thought it was impossible.\n\n14:43.400 --> 14:44.620\n Oh, they thought he would die.\n\n14:44.620 --> 14:45.460\n He would die.\n\n14:45.460 --> 14:47.940\n It's not humanly possible, yeah.\n\n14:47.940 --> 14:49.080\n So what?\n\n14:49.080 --> 14:50.800\n Well, you've done your homework.\n\n14:50.800 --> 14:51.920\n For what, the book, or what?\n\n14:51.920 --> 14:53.600\n Oh, I don't know, for me, you've done your homework.\n\n14:53.600 --> 14:54.880\n Yeah, I know, but yeah.\n\n14:54.880 --> 14:55.720\n What?\n\n14:55.720 --> 14:59.480\n I was sitting here by Putin to do research, yeah.\n\n14:59.480 --> 15:03.040\n So what lesson do you take from that story for yourself,\n\n15:03.040 --> 15:05.880\n the impossible, trying to accomplish the impossible?\n\n15:05.880 --> 15:07.680\n Well, the impossible is possible.\n\n15:08.560 --> 15:10.320\n It's just that simple.\n\n15:10.320 --> 15:12.040\n Time changes things.\n\n15:12.040 --> 15:17.040\n I mean, if you looked at where the mile time is right now,\n\n15:18.440 --> 15:20.560\n compared to that four minute mile,\n\n15:20.560 --> 15:23.120\n which when it was broke by a couple of tenths,\n\n15:23.120 --> 15:24.640\n or three or four tenths,\n\n15:25.500 --> 15:30.520\n it's now broke by another 20 seconds.\n\n15:30.520 --> 15:32.920\n Yeah, by several hundred people, yeah.\n\n15:32.920 --> 15:35.200\n Yeah, I mean, by tons of people.\n\n15:35.200 --> 15:37.480\n And it's pretty much common knowledge\n\n15:37.480 --> 15:38.680\n that you gotta run a four minute mile\n\n15:38.680 --> 15:39.920\n if you're gonna go somewhere now,\n\n15:39.920 --> 15:43.960\n or below if you're gonna win events at major level,\n\n15:43.960 --> 15:45.760\n that you gotta be able to do that.\n\n15:45.760 --> 15:47.520\n And so you can take that,\n\n15:47.520 --> 15:52.520\n and you can look at what in time history\n\n15:53.360 --> 15:56.480\n has as its record performance,\n\n15:58.040 --> 16:01.640\n and you can realize that that record performance,\n\n16:01.640 --> 16:02.600\n it's gonna change.\n\n16:02.600 --> 16:03.420\n Yeah.\n\n16:03.420 --> 16:07.380\n And they don't take into all the factors of knowledge.\n\n16:08.320 --> 16:12.480\n They don't take in all the factors of better shoes.\n\n16:12.480 --> 16:13.840\n They don't take in all the factors\n\n16:13.840 --> 16:16.920\n of better understanding of nutrition.\n\n16:16.920 --> 16:19.020\n I mean, it's like me as an athlete.\n\n16:21.680 --> 16:23.700\n I went to practice every day in high school\n\n16:23.700 --> 16:27.720\n for at least my sophomore, and my junior,\n\n16:27.720 --> 16:29.960\n and part of my senior year,\n\n16:29.960 --> 16:33.760\n and all of a sudden a new rule came up.\n\n16:33.760 --> 16:37.360\n It said, the rule said before that,\n\n16:37.360 --> 16:41.540\n it said at least most of the coaches,\n\n16:43.160 --> 16:45.560\n we don't want you drinking water at practice.\n\n16:45.560 --> 16:46.400\n Yeah.\n\n16:46.400 --> 16:48.960\n And okay, why?\n\n16:48.960 --> 16:50.440\n Because you gotta toughen you up.\n\n16:50.440 --> 16:52.440\n That's a weakness, water.\n\n16:53.320 --> 16:55.280\n And so we would go through practice.\n\n16:55.280 --> 16:56.600\n I mean, and you're sweating,\n\n16:56.600 --> 16:57.800\n and then you're sweating so much\n\n16:57.800 --> 16:59.600\n that you're almost out of sweat.\n\n16:59.600 --> 17:00.440\n Yeah.\n\n17:00.440 --> 17:02.800\n And so you're mostly at the end of practice,\n\n17:02.800 --> 17:04.560\n you're not even wrestling.\n\n17:04.560 --> 17:05.400\n Excuse me.\n\n17:05.400 --> 17:06.800\n You're setting against the wall.\n\n17:06.800 --> 17:07.640\n Yeah.\n\n17:07.640 --> 17:08.460\n Because you're tired.\n\n17:08.460 --> 17:10.600\n So then all of a sudden they say,\n\n17:10.600 --> 17:12.920\n okay, go ahead and drink water during practice,\n\n17:12.920 --> 17:14.360\n drink greater aid during practice.\n\n17:14.360 --> 17:16.200\n And all of a sudden at the end of practice,\n\n17:16.200 --> 17:18.160\n we're still out there competing.\n\n17:18.160 --> 17:21.120\n And so I look at my career for two and a half years\n\n17:21.120 --> 17:23.960\n where I, and junior high too.\n\n17:23.960 --> 17:25.360\n So I got another three years\n\n17:25.360 --> 17:28.800\n where I didn't really, wasn't able to push\n\n17:28.800 --> 17:32.480\n as good as I could because I just was probably under.\n\n17:32.480 --> 17:33.320\n Under hydrated.\n\n17:33.320 --> 17:34.140\n Yeah.\n\n17:34.140 --> 17:34.980\n Yeah.\n\n17:34.980 --> 17:37.040\n So, but at the individual level,\n\n17:37.040 --> 17:38.760\n in terms of the impossible,\n\n17:38.760 --> 17:41.400\n when did you first believe the thing\n\n17:41.400 --> 17:43.680\n that maybe probably people would laugh at you about\n\n17:43.680 --> 17:46.600\n was that you would be an Olympic champion?\n\n17:46.600 --> 17:50.880\n Well, I always visualized me being the best.\n\n17:50.880 --> 17:52.040\n You believed it in the very beginning.\n\n17:52.040 --> 17:53.720\n Forever, forever.\n\n17:53.720 --> 17:55.800\n Yeah, I was, because I was,\n\n17:55.800 --> 17:59.200\n I don't know if you'd call it a dreamer or somebody that,\n\n17:59.200 --> 18:01.800\n I was just involved with competitive sports\n\n18:01.800 --> 18:05.120\n at the YMCA from age five.\n\n18:05.120 --> 18:06.600\n Did you tell people that dream\n\n18:06.600 --> 18:08.960\n that you're gonna be Olympic champion one day?\n\n18:08.960 --> 18:10.280\n You're gonna be the best in the world?\n\n18:10.280 --> 18:12.200\n I think they knew.\n\n18:12.200 --> 18:13.440\n And the only reason why they knew,\n\n18:13.440 --> 18:15.080\n cause there was something a little different\n\n18:15.080 --> 18:15.920\n about this guy.\n\n18:15.920 --> 18:17.640\n He was.\n\n18:17.640 --> 18:18.480\n He's not gonna stop.\n\n18:18.480 --> 18:20.080\n Well, he was out in the yard.\n\n18:20.080 --> 18:20.920\n Yeah.\n\n18:20.920 --> 18:22.200\n And he was swinging baseball bats.\n\n18:22.200 --> 18:23.040\n Yeah.\n\n18:23.040 --> 18:24.440\n He was swinging baseball at six, at seven,\n\n18:24.440 --> 18:26.400\n and eight, and nine, and 10.\n\n18:26.400 --> 18:28.240\n And he was swinging baseball bats,\n\n18:29.200 --> 18:31.480\n so much right handed and so much left hand\n\n18:31.480 --> 18:33.480\n with nobody even there throwing the ball.\n\n18:33.480 --> 18:34.840\n Yeah.\n\n18:34.840 --> 18:36.760\n That all of a sudden when they walked by,\n\n18:36.760 --> 18:39.760\n all of a sudden the grass was down to dirt\n\n18:39.760 --> 18:40.600\n on both sides.\n\n18:40.600 --> 18:41.440\n Yeah.\n\n18:41.440 --> 18:45.640\n So it's like, they saw me out in the yard\n\n18:45.640 --> 18:48.280\n playing by myself sports,\n\n18:48.280 --> 18:51.800\n or you get the neighborhood kids and you play a lot.\n\n18:51.800 --> 18:53.920\n But if they weren't there,\n\n18:53.920 --> 18:55.560\n if you walked in my front room,\n\n18:55.560 --> 18:58.120\n I was hiking a ball like I was the quarterback.\n\n18:58.120 --> 19:02.320\n And I was running and running through the furniture,\n\n19:02.320 --> 19:03.160\n that type stuff.\n\n19:03.160 --> 19:08.160\n So who saw this guy mostly was probably the parents.\n\n19:08.520 --> 19:09.360\n Yeah.\n\n19:09.360 --> 19:11.640\n And the coaches at the YMCA level,\n\n19:11.640 --> 19:12.640\n the junior high level,\n\n19:12.640 --> 19:15.400\n they saw this guy come first and end up last.\n\n19:15.400 --> 19:18.560\n But I wasn't that great.\n\n19:18.560 --> 19:21.160\n I wasn't the fastest guy at that time.\n\n19:21.160 --> 19:24.440\n And I wasn't the strongest guy.\n\n19:24.440 --> 19:25.880\n Actually, before I went to the Olympics,\n\n19:25.880 --> 19:28.120\n when they tested me, they tested everybody.\n\n19:28.120 --> 19:31.000\n And I probably came back with one of the highest scores,\n\n19:31.000 --> 19:36.000\n but it was not like the highest person on this\n\n19:36.960 --> 19:38.320\n and this and that.\n\n19:38.320 --> 19:40.320\n I was all high across the board,\n\n19:40.320 --> 19:43.120\n straight across the board high on every one of them.\n\n19:43.120 --> 19:45.800\n But there was always people that were higher than me.\n\n19:45.800 --> 19:46.640\n Genetics.\n\n19:46.640 --> 19:47.960\n But then they would go down.\n\n19:47.960 --> 19:48.800\n Yeah.\n\n19:48.800 --> 19:50.480\n Then they would test on something else and go back up.\n\n19:50.480 --> 19:53.080\n Mine stayed high all across the board.\n\n19:53.080 --> 19:56.120\n And so I really didn't have too many flaws,\n\n19:56.120 --> 19:58.640\n but I didn't have any things that also said\n\n19:58.640 --> 20:02.520\n that you were gonna be unscored upon at the Olympic games.\n\n20:02.520 --> 20:03.360\n Right.\n\n20:03.360 --> 20:06.080\n So take me through that day, if you could.\n\n20:06.080 --> 20:09.560\n 1972, when you were going for the 68 kilogram\n\n20:09.560 --> 20:11.360\n freestyle wrestling gold,\n\n20:11.360 --> 20:15.720\n you scored 57 points, if I'm correct,\n\n20:15.720 --> 20:18.000\n and had zero points scored on you.\n\n20:18.000 --> 20:19.900\n 57, zero.\n\n20:19.900 --> 20:24.040\n So maybe take me through almost the details.\n\n20:24.040 --> 20:24.960\n What was your routine?\n\n20:24.960 --> 20:25.920\n What was your process?\n\n20:25.920 --> 20:27.400\n What was going through your mind,\n\n20:27.400 --> 20:29.000\n your thoughts of that day?\n\n20:29.000 --> 20:32.560\n Yeah, first of all, it was quite a day\n\n20:32.560 --> 20:36.860\n because we weighed in every day at that time.\n\n20:36.860 --> 20:37.700\n In the morning?\n\n20:37.700 --> 20:39.000\n Yeah, we weighed in two hours\n\n20:39.000 --> 20:41.120\n before the start of the competition.\n\n20:41.120 --> 20:43.440\n And so that didn't mean that you weighed in two hours\n\n20:43.440 --> 20:44.280\n before you wrestled,\n\n20:44.280 --> 20:45.440\n because you didn't know whether you're gonna wrestle\n\n20:45.440 --> 20:47.120\n right away or later on.\n\n20:47.120 --> 20:48.080\n In fact, in that day,\n\n20:48.080 --> 20:52.000\n I don't think I wrestled until later on in the evening.\n\n20:52.000 --> 20:54.080\n So had all day to recover,\n\n20:54.080 --> 20:55.760\n but I didn't really need it anyway,\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:58.920\n because I wasn't really pulling a whole lot of weight,\n\n20:58.920 --> 21:01.680\n but it was just interesting.\n\n21:01.680 --> 21:02.600\n But what was in your mind?\n\n21:02.600 --> 21:03.640\n What were you thinking?\n\n21:03.640 --> 21:04.460\n Were you nervous?\n\n21:04.460 --> 21:05.300\n Were you?\n\n21:05.300 --> 21:06.760\n I was confident.\n\n21:06.760 --> 21:07.800\n I was confident.\n\n21:07.800 --> 21:09.300\n You knew you were gonna win the gold.\n\n21:09.300 --> 21:11.200\n Yeah, I knew I was gonna win.\n\n21:11.200 --> 21:14.440\n But in reality, I didn't know it\n\n21:14.440 --> 21:16.000\n from a cocky point of view.\n\n21:16.000 --> 21:19.080\n I only knew it because for the last\n\n21:20.920 --> 21:23.560\n one, two, three and a half years,\n\n21:23.560 --> 21:25.060\n I had been going to practice,\n\n21:26.960 --> 21:28.980\n and I'd win in every practice.\n\n21:28.980 --> 21:29.820\n You felt good, you won.\n\n21:29.820 --> 21:31.760\n And I hardly ever lose a takedown.\n\n21:31.760 --> 21:34.560\n And if I lost, if somebody scored on me,\n\n21:35.740 --> 21:37.860\n it was like when I went to bed,\n\n21:37.860 --> 21:40.480\n I couldn't sleep until I figured it out.\n\n21:41.660 --> 21:44.080\n Or if I didn't figure it out,\n\n21:44.080 --> 21:48.480\n I would fall asleep and I would wake up\n\n21:48.480 --> 21:50.120\n with the answer of what I needed,\n\n21:50.120 --> 21:51.160\n why I got scored upon.\n\n21:51.160 --> 21:53.420\n So maybe now that you've won the gold,\n\n21:53.420 --> 21:55.040\n can you tell me in the practice room\n\n21:55.040 --> 21:57.080\n when somebody took you down,\n\n21:57.080 --> 22:00.200\n how do you take Dan Gable down in the practice room?\n\n22:00.200 --> 22:01.040\n Timing, technique?\n\n22:01.040 --> 22:03.920\n Very difficult, but somebody could,\n\n22:04.880 --> 22:07.620\n because they were going for one move.\n\n22:09.280 --> 22:10.960\n All I wanted was one move.\n\n22:10.960 --> 22:12.640\n Whereas if you can arrest somebody,\n\n22:12.640 --> 22:14.320\n arrest them the whole practice or half a practice\n\n22:14.320 --> 22:16.440\n for at least 10, 15 minutes,\n\n22:16.440 --> 22:18.760\n and they were maybe gonna score\n\n22:21.280 --> 22:23.140\n if they could work it in their mind.\n\n22:24.920 --> 22:27.440\n But they knew that was gonna be their victory.\n\n22:27.440 --> 22:31.840\n So in the practice room, maybe you can educate me,\n\n22:31.840 --> 22:34.240\n at that, when you're going for the Olympic gold,\n\n22:35.560 --> 22:38.160\n you didn't want to allow any takedowns.\n\n22:38.160 --> 22:39.540\n So there's no such thing as working\n\n22:39.540 --> 22:41.120\n on some kind of weird position,\n\n22:41.120 --> 22:42.640\n a weak point or something.\n\n22:42.640 --> 22:45.680\n It's important to not let down, take down.\n\n22:45.680 --> 22:47.920\n It's kind of like what we were saying before.\n\n22:47.920 --> 22:50.720\n If something happened and somebody scored on me\n\n22:50.720 --> 22:54.440\n in a certain way, I would go over that situation,\n\n22:54.440 --> 22:56.880\n over that situation, over it again,\n\n22:56.880 --> 22:58.640\n and I would come up with an answer.\n\n22:58.640 --> 23:00.440\n And then I would actually test it.\n\n23:01.560 --> 23:03.480\n Maybe I wouldn't go right back the next day\n\n23:03.480 --> 23:07.120\n because I didn't want the guy to not have some,\n\n23:07.120 --> 23:09.200\n I didn't want him to think that I was thinking\n\n23:09.200 --> 23:11.080\n about it all night, I didn't tell him.\n\n23:11.080 --> 23:14.100\n But maybe three days later when he wrestled again,\n\n23:14.100 --> 23:19.100\n I actually had it figured out because he wasn't able to.\n\n23:20.000 --> 23:24.440\n Or even if I was in on a takedown, an offensive move,\n\n23:24.440 --> 23:27.120\n and I got stopped and didn't score,\n\n23:27.120 --> 23:29.920\n I had to go back and filter that.\n\n23:29.920 --> 23:34.160\n But it wasn't something that usually I couldn't solve.\n\n23:34.160 --> 23:35.740\n I could usually solve it.\n\n23:35.740 --> 23:37.040\n Let's go back to the Olympic games.\n\n23:37.040 --> 23:39.320\n So I get up in the Olympic in the morning\n\n23:39.320 --> 23:41.260\n and I'm not sure when the weigh ins were,\n\n23:41.260 --> 23:44.280\n but I think I was probably a pound over.\n\n23:45.760 --> 23:49.040\n And that's about a half a kilo and 1.1 pounds is a kilo\n\n23:49.040 --> 23:50.240\n because we went in kilograms.\n\n23:50.240 --> 23:51.480\n So what do you do with that pound?\n\n23:51.480 --> 23:52.400\n You aren't off or?\n\n23:52.400 --> 23:55.720\n No, I just went over to the, they had a sauna there\n\n23:55.720 --> 23:56.960\n and I got in the sauna.\n\n23:56.960 --> 24:00.720\n And the funny thing was the morning of the finals,\n\n24:03.200 --> 24:06.680\n there was another athlete in the sauna.\n\n24:06.680 --> 24:10.680\n And it was American or?\n\n24:10.680 --> 24:12.880\n No, it was a European.\n\n24:12.880 --> 24:14.880\n I don't remember where she was from.\n\n24:14.880 --> 24:15.760\n Not a Russian.\n\n24:15.760 --> 24:16.680\n Well, you know what?\n\n24:16.680 --> 24:21.680\n I kind of think it was a plot because it was a girl.\n\n24:22.040 --> 24:22.880\n Interesting.\n\n24:22.880 --> 24:24.680\n And she didn't have her top on.\n\n24:24.680 --> 24:25.520\n Oh, wow.\n\n24:27.200 --> 24:28.640\n And that was pretty common.\n\n24:28.640 --> 24:31.040\n And so, you know, it was kind of interesting.\n\n24:31.040 --> 24:36.040\n You think back about it because there's some funny things\n\n24:36.040 --> 24:40.800\n that go on behind the scenes in Olympic games,\n\n24:40.800 --> 24:43.560\n in world games, anytime when you have country\n\n24:43.560 --> 24:44.520\n against country.\n\n24:44.520 --> 24:47.040\n And so there's some crazy stuff that goes on.\n\n24:47.040 --> 24:49.120\n Did any of it affect you?\n\n24:49.120 --> 24:49.960\n Was there any?\n\n24:49.960 --> 24:51.840\n Well, I almost stayed too long in the sauna.\n\n24:51.840 --> 24:56.240\n You lost a little bit over a pound.\n\n24:56.240 --> 24:58.160\n I lost a little more than a pound.\n\n24:58.160 --> 25:00.960\n But it didn't really bother me\n\n25:00.960 --> 25:04.200\n because I wasn't like cutting a lot of weight.\n\n25:04.200 --> 25:08.120\n So your match against the Russian, the...\n\n25:08.120 --> 25:08.960\n Azhelyov.\n\n25:08.960 --> 25:09.880\n Yeah, Azhelyov.\n\n25:09.880 --> 25:12.040\n He went on to be a two time world champion,\n\n25:12.040 --> 25:13.600\n a silver medalist as well.\n\n25:13.600 --> 25:15.560\n I mean, this is an incredible wrestler.\n\n25:15.560 --> 25:17.560\n So what was going through your mind\n\n25:18.520 --> 25:20.600\n before stepping on the mat with that guy?\n\n25:20.600 --> 25:22.240\n You've beaten a bunch of wrestlers,\n\n25:22.240 --> 25:24.600\n haven't had a point scored on you.\n\n25:24.600 --> 25:26.840\n And you're stepping on the mat against this Russian\n\n25:26.840 --> 25:29.080\n who you said was really, they picked,\n\n25:29.080 --> 25:31.360\n the Soviets picked to beat you.\n\n25:31.360 --> 25:33.200\n Right, and I know why they picked him\n\n25:33.200 --> 25:34.760\n because he had a great attitude.\n\n25:34.760 --> 25:38.560\n So he wasn't just the typical artist.\n\n25:38.560 --> 25:39.760\n He was a good artist.\n\n25:39.760 --> 25:42.400\n He hooked elbows like Azhelyov.\n\n25:42.400 --> 25:45.000\n And he's from that area of the world\n\n25:45.000 --> 25:47.280\n where they have some of those types of moves.\n\n25:47.280 --> 25:50.040\n But he, and he was a goer,\n\n25:50.040 --> 25:52.320\n but by cutting him down a weight,\n\n25:52.320 --> 25:53.640\n he lost some of that go.\n\n25:54.800 --> 25:57.080\n And I don't know if, you gotta,\n\n25:57.080 --> 26:00.600\n that's a process you gotta go about scientifically.\n\n26:00.600 --> 26:01.440\n Yeah.\n\n26:01.440 --> 26:04.800\n And so, if you don't do it as an American,\n\n26:04.800 --> 26:06.360\n it can really hurt your performance.\n\n26:06.360 --> 26:08.040\n If you don't do it as a Russian,\n\n26:08.040 --> 26:09.120\n it can hurt your performance.\n\n26:09.120 --> 26:12.720\n And they already didn't really do that a lot\n\n26:12.720 --> 26:14.960\n where you usually wrestle the weight\n\n26:14.960 --> 26:17.080\n where it was more like your weight.\n\n26:17.080 --> 26:19.640\n And so by cutting him down,\n\n26:19.640 --> 26:23.040\n maybe slowed his belief down a little bit.\n\n26:23.040 --> 26:23.880\n So you saw it in him.\n\n26:23.880 --> 26:26.240\n The spirit was a little bit gone when you were facing him.\n\n26:26.240 --> 26:29.600\n Yeah, but then he came back and he won rest of the matches\n\n26:29.600 --> 26:31.360\n and he was in the round robin\n\n26:31.360 --> 26:33.440\n and he was able to go to the finals,\n\n26:34.520 --> 26:36.840\n but he had lost another match actually\n\n26:36.840 --> 26:39.160\n against in the round robin against the Japanese.\n\n26:39.160 --> 26:44.160\n So I think I had already gained enough of artistic,\n\n26:45.320 --> 26:46.720\n being able to finish a match.\n\n26:46.720 --> 26:49.960\n Once I lost my match in college for the last two years,\n\n26:49.960 --> 26:52.600\n I took on some of that artistic work.\n\n26:52.600 --> 26:57.600\n And I think that he was already hoping to win,\n\n26:57.680 --> 27:00.040\n but he was hoping to win by a long ways\n\n27:00.040 --> 27:04.520\n because he had to pin me or beat me by eight points\n\n27:04.520 --> 27:06.220\n to be able to win the gold.\n\n27:06.220 --> 27:09.000\n And that wasn't gonna happen.\n\n27:09.000 --> 27:11.000\n I mean, the chances of pin is pretty good.\n\n27:11.000 --> 27:14.140\n Is it hard to pin Dan Gable versus take down?\n\n27:14.140 --> 27:17.840\n Like, have you taken risks where you could pay for them?\n\n27:17.840 --> 27:21.140\n I can't remember too many that I took\n\n27:21.140 --> 27:23.960\n that would actually put me in a danger position.\n\n27:23.960 --> 27:27.360\n I've taken risk, but the risks were so scientifically,\n\n27:27.360 --> 27:30.700\n technically correct that I wouldn't land\n\n27:30.700 --> 27:33.080\n in that danger zone.\n\n27:33.080 --> 27:35.040\n It's like, if I'm gonna lock up and throw you,\n\n27:35.040 --> 27:37.040\n I'm not gonna throw you to my own back\n\n27:37.040 --> 27:38.040\n and roll you through.\n\n27:38.040 --> 27:40.280\n I'm gonna turn in the air.\n\n27:40.280 --> 27:41.360\n So you were scientific about it.\n\n27:41.360 --> 27:42.600\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n27:44.760 --> 27:46.200\n I learned the hard way.\n\n27:46.200 --> 27:49.640\n Early on, there was moves from collegiate wrestling\n\n27:49.640 --> 27:51.960\n that you did that exposed your shoulders,\n\n27:51.960 --> 27:55.460\n which it cost me in some early freestyle matches\n\n27:55.460 --> 27:57.580\n against great wrestlers.\n\n27:57.580 --> 28:02.580\n But I would go back to my collegiate escaping type moves\n\n28:03.420 --> 28:04.840\n to where I hit a Granby roll\n\n28:04.840 --> 28:06.280\n where you expose your shoulders\n\n28:06.280 --> 28:08.040\n and you lose two points every time.\n\n28:08.040 --> 28:10.400\n But you learn that that's not the system.\n\n28:10.400 --> 28:12.800\n But if you hadn't wrestled much,\n\n28:12.800 --> 28:17.800\n you would get exposed under maybe a desperate situation.\n\n28:17.900 --> 28:18.880\n You would hit it.\n\n28:18.880 --> 28:20.640\n So you won the gold.\n\n28:20.640 --> 28:22.380\n How did it feel?\n\n28:22.380 --> 28:23.800\n I think it would have,\n\n28:23.800 --> 28:26.200\n I think the question would be how would it feel\n\n28:26.200 --> 28:28.680\n if you lost the gold for me?\n\n28:28.680 --> 28:31.240\n Because I already went through that once.\n\n28:32.420 --> 28:33.520\n Not at that highest level,\n\n28:33.520 --> 28:35.840\n but the National Collegiate Championship level\n\n28:35.840 --> 28:36.680\n my senior year.\n\n28:36.680 --> 28:37.680\n The Larry Owings loss.\n\n28:37.680 --> 28:39.000\n Larry Owings, yeah.\n\n28:39.000 --> 28:40.480\n And that didn't sit well.\n\n28:40.480 --> 28:43.320\n Were you afraid of that happening again\n\n28:44.200 --> 28:45.400\n at the Olympic level?\n\n28:45.400 --> 28:46.240\n Was that even a thought?\n\n28:46.240 --> 28:47.420\n No, I really wasn't.\n\n28:47.420 --> 28:52.200\n But it was why I changed my philosophy of training\n\n28:52.200 --> 28:57.200\n and added to the scientific artist type.\n\n28:57.840 --> 29:00.060\n And if I had won that match,\n\n29:00.060 --> 29:01.600\n even though I wouldn't have felt good about it,\n\n29:01.600 --> 29:03.700\n even though I squeaked it out,\n\n29:04.600 --> 29:06.880\n I wasn't feeling good about that match.\n\n29:06.880 --> 29:09.640\n It would have affected me a little bit,\n\n29:09.640 --> 29:10.480\n but if I'd have won it,\n\n29:10.480 --> 29:12.360\n I would have got over it.\n\n29:12.360 --> 29:14.600\n I mean, I'm not over it now.\n\n29:14.600 --> 29:17.720\n I mean, I don't know why I was doing this kind of stuff\n\n29:17.720 --> 29:19.840\n right before my match.\n\n29:19.840 --> 29:21.000\n By that, I mean this kind of stuff.\n\n29:21.000 --> 29:23.200\n Interviews, yeah, journalists.\n\n29:23.200 --> 29:25.080\n Yeah, and I really wasn't a good talker then.\n\n29:25.080 --> 29:26.880\n I mean, me and you were talking pretty good right now,\n\n29:26.880 --> 29:28.040\n except for I got a little cold,\n\n29:28.040 --> 29:32.740\n but I don't think I could say two words hardly then.\n\n29:32.740 --> 29:35.580\n And they took takes.\n\n29:35.580 --> 29:36.520\n Wide World of Sports said,\n\n29:36.520 --> 29:39.520\n hey, we want you to be the introduction\n\n29:39.520 --> 29:41.400\n for our next week's show.\n\n29:41.400 --> 29:42.940\n So I just say, hey, I'm Dan Gable.\n\n29:42.940 --> 29:46.340\n Come watch me as I finish my career undefeated 182 and 0.\n\n29:46.340 --> 29:47.240\n That's what they want me to say.\n\n29:47.240 --> 29:48.960\n Everybody assumed you'd be undefeated.\n\n29:48.960 --> 29:50.700\n And I said it.\n\n29:50.700 --> 29:52.680\n I had to take it 22 times.\n\n29:52.680 --> 29:56.080\n And the last two or three times they wrote it out\n\n29:56.080 --> 29:59.280\n and I read it and it still wasn't like I just said it.\n\n29:59.280 --> 30:02.880\n I was reading it like, hi, I'm Dan Gable.\n\n30:02.880 --> 30:05.120\n Come on.\n\n30:05.120 --> 30:06.400\n You know, that type of stuff.\n\n30:06.400 --> 30:08.640\n So, and he finally just closed the book and said,\n\n30:08.640 --> 30:10.120\n yeah, that's good enough.\n\n30:10.120 --> 30:12.360\n But I turned and it was my time to wrestle.\n\n30:13.440 --> 30:17.120\n And so, you know, you just, you learn that,\n\n30:17.120 --> 30:20.400\n and for me it was great coaching experience\n\n30:20.400 --> 30:22.040\n because that's what I turned into be.\n\n30:22.040 --> 30:25.400\n You know, I coached for longer than I wrestled.\n\n30:25.400 --> 30:28.200\n And I put out a lot of champions,\n\n30:28.200 --> 30:32.060\n but you learn through mistakes that even in your own career\n\n30:32.060 --> 30:36.080\n that you had made, you know, it's an ever learning process.\n\n30:36.080 --> 30:37.680\n It's an ever learning process.\n\n30:38.560 --> 30:40.880\n Have you ever been afraid on the mat?\n\n30:40.880 --> 30:45.700\n Does fear have any role do you think for a wrestler\n\n30:45.700 --> 30:46.540\n or it must be out there?\n\n30:46.540 --> 30:48.880\n Well, I'm sure fear is out there.\n\n30:48.880 --> 30:52.360\n And I'm sure that was to my advantage almost every time.\n\n30:52.360 --> 30:54.920\n I'm sure in my Olympic finals, I was really off.\n\n30:54.920 --> 30:56.200\n He had these doubts.\n\n30:56.200 --> 30:57.840\n He probably had these doubts.\n\n30:58.760 --> 31:01.940\n And that gives me the edge.\n\n31:02.840 --> 31:07.240\n And I don't know if I really ever had fear,\n\n31:09.280 --> 31:12.160\n but obviously there was points in times\n\n31:12.160 --> 31:16.680\n where I didn't perform as well, not many, but a few.\n\n31:16.680 --> 31:20.120\n And if I look back of it, look back at it,\n\n31:20.120 --> 31:24.440\n I don't think it was that American, you know,\n\n31:24.440 --> 31:26.160\n raw, raw, raw stuff.\n\n31:26.160 --> 31:28.880\n I think it was probably the fear\n\n31:28.880 --> 31:33.040\n of not being an artist as much.\n\n31:33.040 --> 31:34.760\n You know, maybe this guy might be better\n\n31:34.760 --> 31:37.920\n than me scientifically.\n\n31:37.920 --> 31:40.360\n And you know, you're a scientist.\n\n31:40.360 --> 31:43.600\n I think that got to me more than anything else.\n\n31:43.600 --> 31:46.760\n I said early on that I want to eliminate\n\n31:46.760 --> 31:49.800\n ever having to worry about getting tired in a match.\n\n31:49.800 --> 31:51.600\n So I kind of eliminated that.\n\n31:51.600 --> 31:53.400\n So I got rid of that point.\n\n31:53.400 --> 31:55.980\n And I do think that in wrestling,\n\n31:55.980 --> 32:00.320\n that is one of the fears that a lot of wrestlers have,\n\n32:00.320 --> 32:02.560\n actually how they feel during the match\n\n32:02.560 --> 32:05.960\n and are they gonna get tired\n\n32:05.960 --> 32:08.380\n and is it gonna affect my performance?\n\n32:08.380 --> 32:11.320\n And as a coach, that really was one of the things\n\n32:11.320 --> 32:13.520\n I tried to eliminate on all my athletes.\n\n32:13.520 --> 32:15.360\n So there wasn't that fear factor,\n\n32:15.360 --> 32:19.840\n but that fear factor would be put upon my opponent,\n\n32:19.840 --> 32:22.380\n which would give me an edge.\n\n32:23.240 --> 32:25.720\n But that's not what I needed as much.\n\n32:25.720 --> 32:26.760\n I needed to just focus,\n\n32:26.760 --> 32:28.720\n make sure that I was doing the right things.\n\n32:28.720 --> 32:30.080\n And I needed my team to be focused.\n\n32:30.080 --> 32:33.320\n So I made sure that for my mistakes as an athlete\n\n32:33.320 --> 32:36.400\n or even as a coach sometimes, that I didn't repeat them.\n\n32:37.440 --> 32:38.280\n Didn't repeat them.\n\n32:38.280 --> 32:41.120\n And if you make a mistake once and then you can repeat it,\n\n32:41.120 --> 32:44.640\n then it's like you didn't learn anything.\n\n32:45.640 --> 32:47.800\n Your goal throughout your wrestling career,\n\n32:47.800 --> 32:49.440\n as you've beautifully put,\n\n32:49.440 --> 32:52.400\n was to work so hard that you pass out on the mat, right?\n\n32:52.400 --> 32:54.160\n That you would be carried off the mat.\n\n32:54.160 --> 32:56.500\n So you never did successfully in,\n\n32:56.500 --> 32:58.440\n that's one of the ways you failed in your career\n\n32:58.440 --> 33:01.420\n is you've never worked so hard that you've passed out.\n\n33:01.420 --> 33:02.640\n Have you ever come close?\n\n33:02.640 --> 33:04.640\n Do you remember a time that you've come close\n\n33:04.640 --> 33:07.040\n that you've been pushed to the limits of exhaustion?\n\n33:07.040 --> 33:08.980\n You know, the question is really a good question\n\n33:08.980 --> 33:12.480\n about that pushing to you collapse.\n\n33:12.480 --> 33:13.320\n Yeah.\n\n33:13.320 --> 33:15.960\n Because I don't, as a coach today, I don't think I get,\n\n33:15.960 --> 33:17.700\n if I said that to my athletes,\n\n33:18.780 --> 33:20.640\n I don't know, I could get in trouble.\n\n33:22.280 --> 33:23.120\n Because, you know, it's like.\n\n33:23.120 --> 33:26.720\n But it's understood, isn't it, by the athletes?\n\n33:26.720 --> 33:29.000\n Yeah, they understand it.\n\n33:29.000 --> 33:31.480\n But the outside might not understand it.\n\n33:31.480 --> 33:34.000\n Because it's almost like, what do you mean there?\n\n33:34.000 --> 33:36.840\n You push them to the point where they go collapse.\n\n33:36.840 --> 33:40.080\n It means they may die or something might happen to them.\n\n33:40.080 --> 33:41.920\n And, you know, that's dangerous.\n\n33:41.920 --> 33:42.740\n That's dangerous.\n\n33:42.740 --> 33:45.160\n We can't have our kid in that type of atmosphere.\n\n33:45.160 --> 33:48.480\n But it's something that's highly unlikely\n\n33:48.480 --> 33:49.320\n that's gonna happen.\n\n33:49.320 --> 33:52.160\n But I'm gonna tell you, there's many times in a practice\n\n33:52.160 --> 33:55.480\n where I had pushed myself to all of a sudden\n\n33:55.480 --> 33:58.280\n the whistle blew or it was time to stop.\n\n33:58.280 --> 34:01.880\n And when I got up off the mat or wherever I was at\n\n34:01.880 --> 34:06.880\n and I needed water, I needed fresh air,\n\n34:07.840 --> 34:09.440\n because you're usually in a fairly small room\n\n34:09.440 --> 34:12.440\n with a lot of guys that the heat rises\n\n34:12.440 --> 34:14.980\n and it's hard to breathe.\n\n34:14.980 --> 34:17.900\n And that I can remember, and I stayed a lot of times\n\n34:17.900 --> 34:20.400\n not by the door, the far end of the room.\n\n34:20.400 --> 34:22.680\n I can remember walking from the far end of the room\n\n34:22.680 --> 34:23.600\n to that door.\n\n34:23.600 --> 34:27.120\n And I can remember, am I gonna make it the next step?\n\n34:27.120 --> 34:28.920\n Am I gonna make it the next step?\n\n34:28.920 --> 34:31.620\n I need air, I need water, I need oxygen,\n\n34:31.620 --> 34:33.080\n I need to get out of here.\n\n34:33.080 --> 34:34.480\n It didn't happen often,\n\n34:34.480 --> 34:37.600\n but I can recount four or five times in my career\n\n34:37.600 --> 34:39.360\n that I pushed myself to that level\n\n34:39.360 --> 34:42.240\n where I thought I was gonna maybe go out,\n\n34:42.240 --> 34:44.760\n but every step I was dizzy.\n\n34:44.760 --> 34:47.080\n But once I got to that door,\n\n34:47.080 --> 34:50.160\n I was able to open it and go out and grab the water\n\n34:50.160 --> 34:51.960\n and get cold water in my face.\n\n34:51.960 --> 34:55.200\n And so, no, I never really was able to do that.\n\n34:55.200 --> 34:57.300\n And I think the story is in a book\n\n34:57.300 --> 35:00.760\n where my daughter pushed a collapse, Molly.\n\n35:00.760 --> 35:01.600\n It made you proud.\n\n35:01.600 --> 35:03.520\n Oh my gosh, and she didn't win.\n\n35:04.400 --> 35:06.520\n But she pushed a collapse.\n\n35:06.520 --> 35:09.840\n Now, did she suffer because of that?\n\n35:10.760 --> 35:13.360\n Well, she didn't get to go to the next event\n\n35:13.360 --> 35:15.200\n because she had to qualify.\n\n35:15.200 --> 35:18.840\n But I think it probably helped her too,\n\n35:18.840 --> 35:20.760\n realizing because she was winning the race\n\n35:20.760 --> 35:23.200\n and she was beating people she normally never pushed,\n\n35:23.200 --> 35:25.760\n but she was at a new level that she had never been before\n\n35:25.760 --> 35:28.720\n and she only needed about five feet to finish.\n\n35:28.720 --> 35:30.920\n And it was just one of those things that\n\n35:30.920 --> 35:33.320\n I bet there was a lot of learning that she did there.\n\n35:33.320 --> 35:37.440\n And it probably made her realize that she could be better,\n\n35:37.440 --> 35:39.000\n but she had to hold up though.\n\n35:40.360 --> 35:42.600\n So you mentioned in Wrestling Life\n\n35:42.600 --> 35:47.360\n that the Brands Brothers looked up to Roy Salger,\n\n35:47.360 --> 35:50.600\n who was known for pushing the limits of physical wrestling,\n\n35:50.600 --> 35:52.700\n but not getting too rough.\n\n35:52.700 --> 35:54.200\n So how do you find the line\n\n35:54.200 --> 35:56.620\n between extreme physical wrestling,\n\n35:56.620 --> 36:00.920\n but at the same time not rough wrestling or angry wrestling?\n\n36:00.920 --> 36:05.320\n So that line between aggression, tough wrestling and anger.\n\n36:05.320 --> 36:10.320\n Well, I think anger would cause less successful wrestling.\n\n36:11.760 --> 36:14.960\n I think anger would cause you to make mistakes\n\n36:14.960 --> 36:17.200\n and actually get out of position\n\n36:18.160 --> 36:21.620\n because I think anger is kind of a loss of control.\n\n36:21.620 --> 36:26.620\n And there can be a furious type of attack,\n\n36:31.320 --> 36:34.320\n but I think if it crosses the line to anger,\n\n36:36.320 --> 36:38.820\n then you're gonna be vulnerable.\n\n36:38.820 --> 36:43.820\n And so Royce and the Brands wrestled to the edge,\n\n36:47.320 --> 36:50.620\n through the edge, but when the whistle blew,\n\n36:50.620 --> 36:52.520\n they stopped.\n\n36:52.520 --> 36:54.620\n And there's people that when the whistle blows,\n\n36:54.620 --> 36:55.460\n they keep going.\n\n36:56.660 --> 36:59.360\n It's like in a football game,\n\n36:59.360 --> 37:01.800\n a fight breaks out and it's after the whistles blow.\n\n37:02.800 --> 37:06.120\n Well, when the whistle blew, they backed off.\n\n37:07.480 --> 37:12.340\n So that whistle was something that in a match,\n\n37:14.200 --> 37:18.080\n that kind of gave them the boundaries.\n\n37:18.080 --> 37:20.360\n But perhaps it could be a little bit of fuel.\n\n37:20.360 --> 37:23.000\n So in Wrestling Tough, the book that you just got\n\n37:23.000 --> 37:25.240\n from Mike Chapman, the new edition,\n\n37:25.240 --> 37:28.720\n talks about Bill Cole, undefeated Northern Iowa wrestler.\n\n37:28.720 --> 37:33.600\n And how he talked about how my strength, speed\n\n37:33.600 --> 37:36.140\n and ability to think were increased tremendously\n\n37:36.140 --> 37:39.400\n by just sitting apart from the action prior to the match\n\n37:39.400 --> 37:42.880\n and getting into a state of controlled anger.\n\n37:42.880 --> 37:47.880\n So can anger, controlled, so anger could be fuel\n\n37:48.280 --> 37:49.720\n as long as it's controlled.\n\n37:49.720 --> 37:50.960\n Right, exactly.\n\n37:50.960 --> 37:52.680\n You had that line.\n\n37:52.680 --> 37:55.920\n One side of the line, you can have an anger\n\n37:55.920 --> 37:58.480\n for performance and the other side of the line,\n\n38:00.160 --> 38:02.720\n if you go beyond that, it's not gonna be for performance.\n\n38:02.720 --> 38:04.960\n It's gonna be for not performance\n\n38:04.960 --> 38:06.520\n because you're gonna lose points.\n\n38:06.520 --> 38:07.500\n It's a fine line.\n\n38:07.500 --> 38:09.560\n There's definitely a fine line.\n\n38:09.560 --> 38:11.400\n You're talking about Roy Selger.\n\n38:11.400 --> 38:13.000\n You're talking about Tom Brands.\n\n38:13.000 --> 38:14.800\n You're talking about Terry Brands.\n\n38:14.800 --> 38:16.620\n I mean, you got world championship titles there.\n\n38:16.620 --> 38:18.340\n You got Olympic championship title there.\n\n38:18.340 --> 38:23.340\n You got a world silver medalist in Roy Selger.\n\n38:23.640 --> 38:28.640\n And when I talked to him about the world silver medalist,\n\n38:30.080 --> 38:32.040\n he's haunted by that.\n\n38:32.040 --> 38:35.200\n Cause he was actually 20 seconds away from winning\n\n38:35.200 --> 38:36.880\n when he got beat in the end there,\n\n38:36.880 --> 38:38.520\n but that's part of the game.\n\n38:38.520 --> 38:43.520\n And I don't know whether he's okay with it or not.\n\n38:43.520 --> 38:45.840\n Cause he says every, after talking about things,\n\n38:45.840 --> 38:48.500\n he goes, I'm okay with it now.\n\n38:49.400 --> 38:51.400\n But then he keeps talking about it.\n\n38:51.400 --> 38:53.920\n So I don't really think he's okay with it.\n\n38:54.980 --> 38:59.800\n And it's hard for him to actually make amends to himself\n\n39:01.060 --> 39:02.560\n when you really don't do it.\n\n39:02.560 --> 39:04.800\n I mean, it's no matter what the situation,\n\n39:04.800 --> 39:07.360\n even with the Owings loss.\n\n39:07.360 --> 39:09.040\n Yeah, it still eats it.\n\n39:09.040 --> 39:10.860\n I mean, yeah, I'm a world champion.\n\n39:10.860 --> 39:13.240\n He's not, and he wanted to be.\n\n39:13.240 --> 39:14.560\n I'm Olympic champion.\n\n39:14.560 --> 39:16.080\n He's not, he wanted to be.\n\n39:16.080 --> 39:18.160\n One of the greatest coaches of all time.\n\n39:18.160 --> 39:19.320\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n39:19.320 --> 39:24.320\n And so, it's like, why do I keep going back to it?\n\n39:25.720 --> 39:30.260\n Because you don't get over those things.\n\n39:30.260 --> 39:32.360\n So Roy really keeps going back to it,\n\n39:32.360 --> 39:33.800\n even though he says he's fine.\n\n39:35.480 --> 39:38.080\n But then he realizes he's really not fine\n\n39:38.080 --> 39:39.580\n because that's just the nature of the game.\n\n39:39.580 --> 39:42.200\n And that's why he was able to win national titles\n\n39:42.200 --> 39:46.360\n and make world teams and stuff like that.\n\n39:48.100 --> 39:49.200\n What's interesting about him,\n\n39:49.200 --> 39:52.040\n he's analyzed all the people that he's wrestled,\n\n39:52.040 --> 39:55.680\n and a lot of them have won world and Olympic championships.\n\n39:55.680 --> 39:58.560\n And he's beaten every one of them at one time or another.\n\n39:58.560 --> 40:01.560\n And he didn't get to that world championship gold\n\n40:01.560 --> 40:03.340\n or Olympic gold.\n\n40:03.340 --> 40:08.040\n And he says it because they did it.\n\n40:08.040 --> 40:12.960\n So he's showing people that I beaten those guys.\n\n40:14.320 --> 40:18.080\n But apparently he didn't beat them at the right time.\n\n40:18.080 --> 40:20.640\n And so it's still haunting.\n\n40:20.640 --> 40:22.560\n You don't get away from that stuff.\n\n40:22.560 --> 40:27.340\n I mean, it's just like anything in life that's really high.\n\n40:27.340 --> 40:30.240\n I mean, it doesn't have to be athletics.\n\n40:30.240 --> 40:32.480\n I mean, you think I'm ever gonna get over\n\n40:33.520 --> 40:35.760\n the murder of my sister?\n\n40:35.760 --> 40:37.120\n And you might not even know that.\n\n40:37.120 --> 40:39.040\n Let me pause for a second, please.\n\n40:39.040 --> 40:41.460\n You've talked about it, you've written about it.\n\n40:41.460 --> 40:44.100\n So I hope it's okay for me to say that your sister,\n\n40:44.100 --> 40:48.980\n your older sister, on May 31st, 1964,\n\n40:48.980 --> 40:52.060\n was raped and murdered by a local boy.\n\n40:52.960 --> 40:57.500\n So the echoes of pain and anger from that tragic day,\n\n40:57.500 --> 40:59.780\n do they ripple through your life still?\n\n41:00.640 --> 41:02.480\n Through your wrestling, through your coaching,\n\n41:02.480 --> 41:06.360\n through the way you, when you wake up in the morning?\n\n41:06.360 --> 41:07.320\n What is that like?\n\n41:09.960 --> 41:14.580\n It can be very emotional to me under certain circumstances.\n\n41:15.440 --> 41:20.440\n And it can be the mood I'm in.\n\n41:21.880 --> 41:24.640\n It can be maybe if I've had a Mountain Dew\n\n41:24.640 --> 41:27.360\n or maybe if I've had a Gable beer.\n\n41:27.360 --> 41:32.360\n Yeah, or maybe if you turn the country music\n\n41:33.640 --> 41:38.640\n up a little bit loud, emotions come out\n\n41:39.400 --> 41:43.320\n and everybody has them in their life.\n\n41:43.320 --> 41:46.720\n It's just so happens, what brings it out?\n\n41:46.720 --> 41:49.360\n And hopefully it's nothing that you do\n\n41:49.360 --> 41:52.480\n to the extreme point to where it brings it out.\n\n41:52.480 --> 41:54.120\n For me, it's not extreme.\n\n41:54.120 --> 41:55.680\n I don't have to have any of that really,\n\n41:55.680 --> 41:57.760\n I can get emotional.\n\n41:57.760 --> 41:59.500\n How did that change you as a man?\n\n42:01.960 --> 42:03.840\n What it did was realize\n\n42:03.840 --> 42:08.840\n that I was already pretty well developed\n\n42:09.080 --> 42:11.120\n because I was only a sophomore,\n\n42:11.120 --> 42:13.840\n 15 years old in high school.\n\n42:13.840 --> 42:17.860\n And I had parents that weren't making it.\n\n42:17.860 --> 42:20.600\n And my parents are a lot older than me.\n\n42:20.600 --> 42:24.040\n And now that we're down just to me and my parents,\n\n42:24.040 --> 42:26.940\n and I'm gonna be around the house for another two years.\n\n42:27.960 --> 42:30.400\n And they had just lost a daughter\n\n42:30.400 --> 42:33.140\n that was the only other sibling.\n\n42:36.660 --> 42:37.920\n They weren't handling it.\n\n42:37.920 --> 42:42.960\n They were the ones that were suffering much more than me,\n\n42:42.960 --> 42:47.860\n even though I always look back upon one area\n\n42:47.860 --> 42:50.720\n that I wasn't good at was communication at that time,\n\n42:50.720 --> 42:52.800\n except inside the resident room,\n\n42:52.800 --> 42:54.280\n because I had been tipped off.\n\n42:55.760 --> 42:57.480\n Tipped off, what do you mean?\n\n42:57.480 --> 42:59.600\n Well, then everybody said that something to me\n\n42:59.600 --> 43:03.000\n about my sister just three weeks before that,\n\n43:03.000 --> 43:08.000\n that really wasn't normal or practical.\n\n43:08.080 --> 43:09.860\n And I said nothing to nobody.\n\n43:12.920 --> 43:15.160\n Is there a part of you that blames yourself?\n\n43:16.120 --> 43:18.280\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n43:19.520 --> 43:20.360\n Absolutely.\n\n43:20.360 --> 43:25.360\n But I'm 15 years old and you make mistakes.\n\n43:27.360 --> 43:30.000\n And you don't really act on everything\n\n43:30.000 --> 43:31.440\n that happens in your life.\n\n43:32.400 --> 43:34.000\n But I can tell you how it affected me.\n\n43:34.000 --> 43:37.220\n And I acted a lot on anything\n\n43:37.220 --> 43:39.580\n that maybe wasn't even of that consequence.\n\n43:39.580 --> 43:41.120\n I mean, cause I had four daughters\n\n43:41.120 --> 43:42.820\n and I'm telling you when they left every time\n\n43:42.820 --> 43:45.600\n to go somewhere in a car or go out with someplace,\n\n43:45.600 --> 43:47.840\n I always said something to them.\n\n43:47.840 --> 43:50.900\n And they would always say, dad, you said that last night.\n\n43:50.900 --> 43:51.740\n I don't care.\n\n43:51.740 --> 43:54.160\n What, like I love you or like be careful?\n\n43:54.160 --> 43:56.440\n I'd say like, don't be driving and drinking\n\n43:56.440 --> 43:59.640\n or don't be in a car with somebody\n\n43:59.640 --> 44:03.120\n that's of the same nature,\n\n44:03.120 --> 44:05.360\n or stay out of trouble.\n\n44:05.360 --> 44:07.720\n Don't go be somewhere where you have,\n\n44:07.720 --> 44:09.200\n I said, you know how to get out of a car\n\n44:09.200 --> 44:11.340\n if your car goes into the river.\n\n44:12.800 --> 44:16.020\n I'm always thinking ahead a little bit,\n\n44:16.020 --> 44:19.360\n just in case of something did happen.\n\n44:19.360 --> 44:22.120\n And it goes back to that walk to school\n\n44:22.120 --> 44:25.160\n with that young man that when he was talking to me\n\n44:25.160 --> 44:28.480\n and I just, I took it and I kept it inside me.\n\n44:28.480 --> 44:31.480\n And once I found out she had been murdered,\n\n44:33.180 --> 44:37.040\n it took me maybe 25 to 30 minutes.\n\n44:37.040 --> 44:39.920\n And I told my dad, I think I know who killed her.\n\n44:41.140 --> 44:44.640\n And he looked at me and he just like,\n\n44:44.640 --> 44:46.080\n he slapped me actually.\n\n44:46.080 --> 44:47.280\n He pushed me against the car.\n\n44:47.280 --> 44:48.120\n He didn't slap me.\n\n44:48.120 --> 44:48.960\n He pushed me against the car.\n\n44:48.960 --> 44:49.800\n My mom slaps me.\n\n44:49.800 --> 44:51.320\n She was the one that slapped me around a little bit.\n\n44:51.320 --> 44:55.120\n But my dad, he pushed me against the car and go,\n\n44:55.120 --> 44:57.360\n what do you mean you might know something about this?\n\n44:57.360 --> 44:59.760\n I said, dad, I don't for sure,\n\n44:59.760 --> 45:02.360\n but, and I would probably all crying,\n\n45:02.360 --> 45:05.400\n but, and I don't, I doubt if I was crying yet.\n\n45:06.400 --> 45:08.540\n I've probably cried a lot of tears since,\n\n45:08.540 --> 45:11.280\n but, you know, I just said,\n\n45:11.280 --> 45:15.040\n hey, I was walking to school with this neighbor\n\n45:15.040 --> 45:17.880\n and I never had walked to school with him before.\n\n45:17.880 --> 45:20.840\n And he was kind of a troubled kid.\n\n45:20.840 --> 45:25.840\n And he said something about Diane and it wasn't good,\n\n45:26.080 --> 45:29.680\n but I didn't, he goes, why didn't you say something?\n\n45:29.680 --> 45:33.040\n I said, daddy, I just boy talk, you know?\n\n45:33.040 --> 45:35.600\n So, you know, and so he hugged me, he hugged me,\n\n45:35.600 --> 45:39.520\n he hugged me and, you know, it was one of these things\n\n45:39.520 --> 45:44.520\n that it's definitely made me a lot of who I am\n\n45:46.120 --> 45:48.680\n because there's been a lot of choices and I don't,\n\n45:48.680 --> 45:51.040\n I took the word choice out of my life\n\n45:51.040 --> 45:53.360\n and I just like to say, okay, do the right thing,\n\n45:53.360 --> 45:55.520\n do the thing that you should do.\n\n45:55.520 --> 45:57.200\n And so I don't really, it's like,\n\n45:57.200 --> 45:58.480\n are you gonna do this or this?\n\n45:58.480 --> 45:59.320\n Well, what do you mean?\n\n45:59.320 --> 46:00.820\n Which one's better?\n\n46:00.820 --> 46:01.660\n You know?\n\n46:01.660 --> 46:03.640\n Well, then I'm, so I don't have that choice.\n\n46:03.640 --> 46:05.240\n Just give me the right way to go.\n\n46:05.240 --> 46:08.240\n And so not that I've been perfect by any means,\n\n46:08.240 --> 46:10.880\n but it's made a big difference in my life\n\n46:10.880 --> 46:13.820\n on how I handle my life.\n\n46:13.820 --> 46:16.400\n It's probably given me the opportunity\n\n46:16.400 --> 46:18.120\n to be married for 44 years.\n\n46:18.120 --> 46:22.460\n It's just given me opportunities to be better in my life.\n\n46:22.460 --> 46:26.640\n And I, you know, I wanna thank my sister for that,\n\n46:26.640 --> 46:31.640\n you know, and I think my family was ready to make a split\n\n46:33.520 --> 46:36.200\n because of that incident, they're blaming each other.\n\n46:36.200 --> 46:41.200\n And I think that I was able to help, but more than that,\n\n46:41.840 --> 46:43.060\n they really liked each other,\n\n46:43.060 --> 46:45.560\n but they didn't really know it at the time\n\n46:45.560 --> 46:47.520\n until I got out of the house.\n\n46:47.520 --> 46:50.320\n Two years later, it probably was going on\n\n46:50.320 --> 46:52.960\n for a couple of years until I moved on and went to college.\n\n46:52.960 --> 46:55.320\n Then they found out they really liked each other\n\n46:55.320 --> 46:58.520\n when they were alone and it worked out pretty good.\n\n46:58.520 --> 47:02.080\n But I think them being able to follow me,\n\n47:02.080 --> 47:06.880\n not just through college and the Olympics and worlds,\n\n47:06.880 --> 47:08.200\n but my coaching.\n\n47:08.200 --> 47:11.700\n So it's the same, the same success and factor,\n\n47:11.700 --> 47:14.320\n you know, the excitement and all those things\n\n47:14.320 --> 47:16.980\n gave them a real purpose.\n\n47:16.980 --> 47:21.280\n And it gave my four daughters, it gave my wife,\n\n47:21.280 --> 47:24.240\n you know, a real purpose to be able to be close\n\n47:24.240 --> 47:27.080\n to all these champions and championships.\n\n47:27.080 --> 47:32.080\n And now it's like, there's a family of 22\n\n47:32.080 --> 47:34.600\n and they're all interested in what we're interested in.\n\n47:34.600 --> 47:36.360\n And it's going good, knock on wood.\n\n47:36.360 --> 47:39.240\n But you know, it's something that when all of a sudden\n\n47:39.240 --> 47:40.520\n you got too much time in your hands\n\n47:40.520 --> 47:42.680\n and you're not doing and accomplishing much\n\n47:42.680 --> 47:47.000\n that things probably, you know, get off track.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.360\n What do you think is the role of family in wrestling?\n\n47:49.360 --> 47:50.960\n Can a man do it alone?\n\n47:50.960 --> 47:55.520\n And if not, where's family most important?\n\n47:55.520 --> 48:00.520\n You know, you can do it alone, but why would you want to?\n\n48:00.600 --> 48:01.440\n Yeah.\n\n48:01.440 --> 48:03.000\n I think the chances of doing it alone\n\n48:03.000 --> 48:06.040\n are much less than the chances of doing it together.\n\n48:07.940 --> 48:10.840\n I know they say, don't bring your profession home sometimes.\n\n48:10.840 --> 48:15.840\n They say that, I never got away from my profession.\n\n48:16.000 --> 48:21.000\n And you know, sometimes I, it's like my house right here.\n\n48:21.000 --> 48:25.680\n So when I'm moving home and I'm not going to have an office\n\n48:25.680 --> 48:27.240\n because I'm not going to coach anymore\n\n48:27.240 --> 48:29.760\n or I'm not going to be an assistant athletic director\n\n48:29.760 --> 48:34.320\n for a while, that you got to do something\n\n48:34.320 --> 48:39.320\n that gives you a little bit of a break.\n\n48:39.640 --> 48:42.600\n Not you necessarily, maybe the person you're living with.\n\n48:42.600 --> 48:44.300\n And so I don't know if you looked outside there,\n\n48:44.300 --> 48:45.840\n I got a cabin right out in my backyard.\n\n48:45.840 --> 48:47.400\n You probably can't see it right there, but.\n\n48:47.400 --> 48:48.760\n What's in the cabin?\n\n48:48.760 --> 48:51.480\n That's my house away from my house.\n\n48:51.480 --> 48:55.480\n It's only 30 feet from my house and it's my office\n\n48:55.480 --> 48:57.440\n and it's my workout room.\n\n48:57.440 --> 49:00.980\n I got a sauna there, it's a bed upstairs if I need it.\n\n49:00.980 --> 49:03.380\n If I ever get too close and she says,\n\n49:03.380 --> 49:05.480\n hey, why don't you go sleep in the other house?\n\n49:05.480 --> 49:07.440\n But you know, it kicks me out of the bed, but.\n\n49:07.440 --> 49:08.280\n Get the heck out.\n\n49:08.280 --> 49:09.160\n It's never happened.\n\n49:09.160 --> 49:11.720\n But I do spend a lot of time out there.\n\n49:11.720 --> 49:15.000\n And it's, you know, you got to have a little distance\n\n49:15.000 --> 49:18.960\n sometimes and you got to know your role.\n\n49:18.960 --> 49:21.160\n And so all of a sudden when you're a guy that's been gone\n\n49:21.160 --> 49:23.400\n your whole life from eight o clock in the morning\n\n49:23.400 --> 49:25.440\n until close to seven, three or eight o clock at night.\n\n49:25.440 --> 49:28.120\n So 11, 12 hours a day, then all of a sudden\n\n49:28.120 --> 49:30.960\n you're not gone as much, even though you still work.\n\n49:30.960 --> 49:32.160\n She's trying to slow me down now.\n\n49:32.160 --> 49:35.040\n I'm doing not so much like here, what we're doing right now,\n\n49:35.040 --> 49:37.360\n but it's when I get in the car and drive somewhere\n\n49:37.360 --> 49:40.240\n or fly somewhere, you know, like just last night\n\n49:40.240 --> 49:41.800\n I just went to bed and I hadn't told her\n\n49:41.800 --> 49:45.240\n that this guy called me and he wants me to speak\n\n49:45.240 --> 49:48.520\n for a bit, want to build another, wrestling wants\n\n49:48.520 --> 49:51.640\n to start another wrestlers and business networking out\n\n49:51.640 --> 49:55.880\n in Delaware because we don't have any colleges\n\n49:55.880 --> 49:57.360\n in wrestling in Delaware.\n\n49:57.360 --> 49:59.680\n And so I said, well, you know, I'm glad to do that\n\n49:59.680 --> 50:01.240\n because that's my life, you know?\n\n50:01.240 --> 50:04.560\n So, but then all of a sudden I didn't say anything\n\n50:04.560 --> 50:07.160\n to my wife until all of a sudden this morning.\n\n50:07.160 --> 50:09.480\n And I told her that I might go on the Friday\n\n50:09.480 --> 50:11.280\n the 21st of December.\n\n50:11.280 --> 50:12.400\n Oh no.\n\n50:12.400 --> 50:14.720\n Well, I said, that's not Christmas.\n\n50:14.720 --> 50:18.520\n She goes, we're celebrating Christmas that weekend early\n\n50:18.520 --> 50:21.280\n because a lot of the family can't be here\n\n50:21.280 --> 50:22.400\n except for that weekend.\n\n50:22.400 --> 50:23.400\n Yeah.\n\n50:23.400 --> 50:26.040\n And I said, oh, well, that's not gonna work.\n\n50:26.040 --> 50:28.560\n But I kind of didn't say anything to her at first.\n\n50:28.560 --> 50:30.400\n And then, well, I'll tell you,\n\n50:30.400 --> 50:32.640\n she started getting a little emotional.\n\n50:32.640 --> 50:36.920\n And if I want to stay married for another year, 45 years,\n\n50:36.920 --> 50:41.720\n then I better tell those people that I got family\n\n50:41.720 --> 50:46.720\n obligations because that depends what's most important.\n\n50:48.120 --> 50:48.960\n I love wrestling.\n\n50:48.960 --> 50:52.040\n I love wrestling and I want to start another,\n\n50:52.040 --> 50:54.000\n start another wrestlers and business network.\n\n50:54.000 --> 50:55.880\n But there's more than one Dan Gable out there.\n\n50:55.880 --> 50:59.800\n Well, maybe not, but there's a lot of people\n\n50:59.800 --> 51:04.800\n that are maybe even closer and they got big names.\n\n51:05.040 --> 51:06.760\n I mean, we're doing pretty well right now.\n\n51:06.760 --> 51:09.560\n I mean, we got first two years ago\n\n51:09.560 --> 51:11.320\n and we got second this year.\n\n51:12.320 --> 51:14.160\n And then we got the women's freestyles\n\n51:14.160 --> 51:15.600\n doing good in wrestling.\n\n51:15.600 --> 51:17.640\n We got to work a little bit on our Greco yet,\n\n51:17.640 --> 51:20.280\n but they are working on it.\n\n51:20.280 --> 51:25.280\n But our men's freestyle team right now are excellent.\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:30.560\n And the key for them is to get them all on the same page\n\n51:32.680 --> 51:35.960\n instead of just have new highlights.\n\n51:35.960 --> 51:39.080\n And by that, I'm saying, you look and see who won this year.\n\n51:39.080 --> 51:41.240\n Well, the three guys that have never won before\n\n51:41.240 --> 51:42.080\n won this year.\n\n51:42.080 --> 51:43.240\n We had three world champions.\n\n51:43.240 --> 51:48.040\n Our two past world champions didn't win this year.\n\n51:48.040 --> 51:51.760\n I mean, they did okay, they got medals.\n\n51:51.760 --> 51:52.800\n Did Borrows win?\n\n51:52.800 --> 51:54.120\n No, he did not.\n\n51:54.120 --> 51:55.520\n He got third.\n\n51:55.520 --> 51:56.880\n Oh, that's right, he got bronze, yeah.\n\n51:56.880 --> 52:00.120\n And Sajilov got, I mean, Snyder got second.\n\n52:00.120 --> 52:02.800\n So those two are our main guys.\n\n52:02.800 --> 52:05.840\n So the three new guys that came through\n\n52:05.840 --> 52:08.720\n were guys that hadn't won world gold.\n\n52:08.720 --> 52:11.360\n In fact, two of them have never made a world team before.\n\n52:11.360 --> 52:14.200\n And so we have three world champions this year,\n\n52:14.200 --> 52:16.200\n but we needed all five of them to come through\n\n52:16.200 --> 52:18.440\n to win the championships.\n\n52:18.440 --> 52:22.880\n And so the key really is getting them all to do the same\n\n52:22.880 --> 52:25.680\n at the same time, year in and year out,\n\n52:25.680 --> 52:30.440\n and not just based on, okay, Borrows got beat this year,\n\n52:30.440 --> 52:32.160\n so he'll win next year.\n\n52:32.160 --> 52:34.640\n It's gotta be every year if you're capable of doing that.\n\n52:34.640 --> 52:36.760\n And that's what the coaching staff has to do.\n\n52:36.760 --> 52:39.000\n What's kind of funny that I do have a lot of influence\n\n52:39.000 --> 52:41.960\n actually on the coaching staffs right now at the USA level\n\n52:41.960 --> 52:46.740\n because the women's freestyle guy is Terry Steiner.\n\n52:46.740 --> 52:49.040\n And he wrestled for me, he was a national champion.\n\n52:49.040 --> 52:52.240\n He's got a twin brother that's at Fresno State.\n\n52:52.240 --> 52:56.560\n And then Billy Zaddik is the freestyle coach\n\n52:56.560 --> 53:00.380\n and he wrestled for the Hawkeyes back in the early days.\n\n53:00.380 --> 53:02.040\n And he was the national champion.\n\n53:02.040 --> 53:06.800\n So we've got a lot of former Gable influence on there,\n\n53:06.800 --> 53:07.640\n but it's.\n\n53:07.640 --> 53:08.880\n You got deep roots in there.\n\n53:08.880 --> 53:12.160\n In 2013, the International Olympic Committee, IOC,\n\n53:12.160 --> 53:14.500\n voted wrestling out of the Olympics.\n\n53:14.500 --> 53:17.320\n So a lot of folks know about this,\n\n53:17.320 --> 53:20.040\n the absurdity of it and so on.\n\n53:20.040 --> 53:22.480\n But in a big picture, you can step back now,\n\n53:22.480 --> 53:23.520\n it's five years later.\n\n53:23.520 --> 53:26.820\n What did you learn from that experience?\n\n53:26.820 --> 53:31.160\n Well, first of all, did it surprise me?\n\n53:31.160 --> 53:32.880\n Yeah.\n\n53:32.880 --> 53:35.500\n But did it really surprise me?\n\n53:35.500 --> 53:36.340\n No.\n\n53:38.680 --> 53:39.800\n You gotta run.\n\n53:39.800 --> 53:44.000\n You gotta have people running the organization\n\n53:45.200 --> 53:46.920\n that are top notch.\n\n53:48.080 --> 53:50.280\n If you take anything for granted\n\n53:51.320 --> 53:53.840\n and you're not the person of authority,\n\n53:53.840 --> 53:56.520\n somebody can kick you out.\n\n53:57.640 --> 54:00.240\n And even though we had a lot of authority\n\n54:00.240 --> 54:01.680\n because we're wrestling,\n\n54:01.680 --> 54:05.400\n we're one of the first sports in the Olympics ever,\n\n54:05.400 --> 54:10.400\n and that we think that we're in 180 some countries\n\n54:12.140 --> 54:17.140\n and some of the number one countries in the world\n\n54:18.180 --> 54:22.560\n that are politically strong have the sport,\n\n54:22.560 --> 54:23.440\n we thought we were okay.\n\n54:23.440 --> 54:26.200\n But then you gotta look and see who's running the IOC.\n\n54:26.200 --> 54:31.200\n The IOC, the International Olympic Committee.\n\n54:32.680 --> 54:35.860\n And then you gotta see that in wrestling,\n\n54:35.860 --> 54:37.620\n we don't have anybody in there.\n\n54:37.620 --> 54:39.380\n I mean, that shocked me.\n\n54:39.380 --> 54:43.840\n We've never had anybody on the IOC from wrestling.\n\n54:43.840 --> 54:45.020\n You know why?\n\n54:45.020 --> 54:50.020\n Because we didn't have to, but yes, that's wrong.\n\n54:50.400 --> 54:51.900\n You have to.\n\n54:51.900 --> 54:55.620\n And if you don't have somebody looking out for you\n\n54:55.620 --> 54:57.280\n right within the structure,\n\n54:58.540 --> 55:01.220\n then it's pretty easy for people to turn their head.\n\n55:01.220 --> 55:06.220\n But all it took was the statement,\n\n55:07.000 --> 55:08.740\n you guys are kicked out of the Olympics.\n\n55:08.740 --> 55:09.740\n You guys are done.\n\n55:09.740 --> 55:11.460\n Everybody came together.\n\n55:11.460 --> 55:14.660\n Well, yeah, I mean, it's the first time in history\n\n55:14.660 --> 55:18.060\n that probably all this competitive people\n\n55:18.060 --> 55:20.860\n that were working for their own agenda\n\n55:20.860 --> 55:25.360\n turned that agenda to the sport.\n\n55:27.000 --> 55:30.000\n So that made a big difference and we got a lot done.\n\n55:30.000 --> 55:35.000\n In fact, in America, there was several people\n\n55:35.400 --> 55:40.400\n that were really out there that we didn't know about\n\n55:40.560 --> 55:42.560\n until this point in time.\n\n55:42.560 --> 55:46.540\n And when they came aboard, now they're still aboard.\n\n55:47.800 --> 55:50.280\n That doesn't mean we're doing everything perfect\n\n55:50.280 --> 55:52.200\n because just because we got voted back in\n\n55:52.200 --> 55:54.660\n before we even got kicked out really,\n\n55:54.660 --> 55:57.460\n that doesn't mean we're by any means safe.\n\n55:58.360 --> 56:00.920\n We have to do some of the things that I'm talking about\n\n56:00.920 --> 56:03.760\n or some of the things that we didn't do before.\n\n56:03.760 --> 56:06.440\n We can't fall right back into the same mess.\n\n56:06.440 --> 56:11.420\n And so our leadership got changed and it's better,\n\n56:11.420 --> 56:13.320\n but it's gotta stay better.\n\n56:13.320 --> 56:18.000\n But there are things that we could still be doing\n\n56:18.000 --> 56:22.760\n to make sure that we don't have situations like this happen.\n\n56:22.760 --> 56:24.560\n I'll tell you, when I first learned about it,\n\n56:24.560 --> 56:29.080\n I was like, I broke down and wept again.\n\n56:29.080 --> 56:30.080\n It's like every once in a while,\n\n56:30.080 --> 56:35.080\n I'll break down and cry about my sister\n\n56:35.560 --> 56:38.520\n or I'll break down, I don't know if I cry\n\n56:38.520 --> 56:42.080\n about losing the owings, but I probably get more determined.\n\n56:42.080 --> 56:45.400\n But that's kind of, you have to go back\n\n56:45.400 --> 56:47.800\n and think about those moments when you heard,\n\n56:47.800 --> 56:52.800\n when I heard that moment and it just overcame me.\n\n56:53.980 --> 56:56.840\n It was like four o clock, 4.30 in the morning\n\n56:56.840 --> 56:57.680\n when I heard about it.\n\n56:57.680 --> 57:00.400\n And my wife had been up looking at the internet\n\n57:00.400 --> 57:03.000\n and she woke me up and I thought she was joking,\n\n57:03.000 --> 57:05.600\n but I jumped out of bed really quick when she said that.\n\n57:05.600 --> 57:07.080\n I knew she was serious.\n\n57:07.080 --> 57:10.680\n And I started making phone calls right then\n\n57:10.680 --> 57:11.960\n to find out if it was true.\n\n57:11.960 --> 57:13.320\n And when I found out it was true,\n\n57:13.320 --> 57:14.720\n it was just like devastating.\n\n57:14.720 --> 57:19.720\n And it was one of these things that it's a nightmare,\n\n57:20.160 --> 57:24.400\n and, but you don't let it happen again.\n\n57:24.400 --> 57:26.040\n It's that simple.\n\n57:26.040 --> 57:27.680\n You keep getting stronger.\n\n57:27.680 --> 57:30.880\n Yeah, and if people haven't read,\n\n57:30.880 --> 57:32.480\n they should read The Loss of Dan Gable\n\n57:32.480 --> 57:34.600\n by Ray Thompson, the ESPN article.\n\n57:34.600 --> 57:37.000\n That kind of, in this very beautiful poetic way,\n\n57:38.240 --> 57:42.840\n ties together all the losses of Dan Gable,\n\n57:42.840 --> 57:46.560\n the losing your sister, losing to Larry Owens,\n\n57:46.560 --> 57:48.680\n losing wrestling from the Olympics,\n\n57:48.680 --> 57:52.260\n all of these tragedies of various forms.\n\n57:53.920 --> 57:57.960\n So that's, well, the IOC, there's politics,\n\n57:57.960 --> 58:00.080\n and you're sort of being very pragmatic.\n\n58:00.080 --> 58:03.480\n But stepping back, wrestling is one of the oldest forms\n\n58:03.480 --> 58:04.920\n of combat, period.\n\n58:04.920 --> 58:08.560\n Dating back, there's cave drawings 15,000 years ago.\n\n58:08.560 --> 58:11.560\n And if you look at the ancient Olympics,\n\n58:11.560 --> 58:13.880\n the Greek Olympics, 2,700 years ago,\n\n58:14.840 --> 58:17.280\n did you ever, when you wrestled or coached,\n\n58:17.280 --> 58:20.720\n do you now see wrestling in this way,\n\n58:20.720 --> 58:22.520\n freestyle and folk style wrestling,\n\n58:22.520 --> 58:26.560\n the purity of sort of two human beings locked in combat,\n\n58:26.560 --> 58:30.400\n the roots of that as just human beings,\n\n58:30.400 --> 58:34.400\n this fair struggle between two men or two women?\n\n58:34.400 --> 58:37.480\n I don't think I ever looked at it\n\n58:37.480 --> 58:42.480\n as anything but just a combat.\n\n58:43.320 --> 58:48.320\n And I think there's times that have made me\n\n58:50.080 --> 58:52.280\n figure out how to make that combat better.\n\n58:53.340 --> 58:58.340\n There's little markers or little points in time in your life\n\n58:58.340 --> 59:06.080\n that make you wonder, or I should say determined,\n\n59:06.080 --> 59:10.040\n to be able to get more out of yourself\n\n59:10.040 --> 59:13.080\n and to be able to take it to a new level.\n\n59:13.080 --> 59:16.400\n And I don't think people can actually feel that way\n\n59:16.400 --> 59:19.480\n unless you've actually had a lot of accomplishments\n\n59:19.480 --> 59:20.920\n in anything.\n\n59:20.920 --> 59:22.400\n I think there's anything out there.\n\n59:22.400 --> 59:24.080\n I mean, no matter what sport\n\n59:24.080 --> 59:26.320\n or breaking the four minute mile,\n\n59:26.320 --> 59:29.480\n I mean, when you broke that, when they broke that,\n\n59:29.480 --> 59:31.600\n Roger Bannister broke that four minute mile,\n\n59:31.600 --> 59:33.260\n I can't imagine him breaking it\n\n59:33.260 --> 59:36.080\n from his best time being 4.30.\n\n59:37.440 --> 59:41.080\n It's one of these things that along the line\n\n59:41.080 --> 59:44.560\n that he did had some close calls\n\n59:45.480 --> 59:49.000\n or he had some coaching that was giving him\n\n59:49.000 --> 59:50.980\n the opportunity to become a little better.\n\n59:50.980 --> 59:54.440\n But I think because he was doing well\n\n59:54.440 --> 59:58.480\n and being very successful, that the opportunity came.\n\n59:58.480 --> 1:00:00.720\n And so it's for me, it's like the same thing.\n\n1:00:00.720 --> 1:00:03.920\n I had so much success\n\n1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:08.400\n and so many practices that went well\n\n1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:13.040\n and so much goodness out of this sport\n\n1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:19.080\n that it gave me the opportunity to really look more finite\n\n1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:23.880\n and look more how I can even make it better.\n\n1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:27.760\n And so it's like, if you look at my library upstairs,\n\n1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:29.400\n I got a library upstairs\n\n1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:35.840\n and there's a lot of books up there from the family.\n\n1:00:35.880 --> 1:00:38.040\n But if you look at the Gable books up there,\n\n1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:42.360\n I got a lot of Russian technique books.\n\n1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:47.360\n I can't read the book, but I can see the diagrams\n\n1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:52.120\n and I can see the figures.\n\n1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:54.200\n They don't really show it in pictures.\n\n1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:55.760\n They do it in drawings.\n\n1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:01.420\n And so it was like when I was trying to beat the best\n\n1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:04.040\n that has labeled the best\n\n1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.120\n because they win the world championships every year\n\n1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:09.920\n since they've been just about involved.\n\n1:01:09.920 --> 1:01:11.440\n And I don't think they got started involved\n\n1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.320\n till like the fifties, but it's something,\n\n1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:19.640\n you study the best who's out there,\n\n1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:23.680\n but then you don't focus so much on the best\n\n1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.720\n that you can't beat the best.\n\n1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:27.560\n You learn from them,\n\n1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:29.840\n but there's something that they don't have\n\n1:01:31.300 --> 1:01:32.960\n that you can have.\n\n1:01:32.960 --> 1:01:36.600\n Toughness to technique, to the art, to the science.\n\n1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:37.660\n Yeah, all that stuff.\n\n1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:39.380\n And that's why I even talking to you\n\n1:01:39.380 --> 1:01:41.680\n and you're sitting over there and you love MIT\n\n1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:43.920\n and you're bragging about it over Harvard.\n\n1:01:45.920 --> 1:01:47.640\n Cause it's true.\n\n1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:50.000\n In your eyes and that's great.\n\n1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:54.100\n And it might be, but it's the same type of thing\n\n1:01:54.100 --> 1:01:57.680\n that there's something that you're probably stealing\n\n1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:01.120\n from Harvard, but you won't give them credit.\n\n1:02:01.120 --> 1:02:03.740\n Well, Dan, in the interest of time,\n\n1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:07.240\n I've read that you're pretty serious.\n\n1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:10.000\n You're pretty seriously into fishing.\n\n1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.100\n So what's the biggest fish you ever caught?\n\n1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:16.840\n What are we talking about here?\n\n1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:18.040\n What are we talking about?\n\n1:02:18.040 --> 1:02:22.140\n No, I don't think I've ever caught a big ocean fish.\n\n1:02:22.140 --> 1:02:24.140\n I'm not, I'm a river lake fisherman.\n\n1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:25.640\n I have fish in the...\n\n1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:26.480\n Trout?\n\n1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:30.000\n No, probably Northern.\n\n1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.400\n I probably caught a Northern that weighed 20 some pounds.\n\n1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.600\n The fish I like to catch is walleyes.\n\n1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:39.320\n And the reason why I like to catch them\n\n1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:41.760\n cause they're really good eating fish.\n\n1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:44.300\n And the best eating fish are not the real big ones.\n\n1:02:44.300 --> 1:02:47.820\n It's kind of interesting.\n\n1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:50.060\n I got people hunting deer right on my land\n\n1:02:50.060 --> 1:02:52.260\n and they're looking for the big bucks,\n\n1:02:52.260 --> 1:02:54.840\n but they're not the best eaters if you want to eat,\n\n1:02:54.840 --> 1:02:56.260\n but they're the best trophy.\n\n1:02:56.260 --> 1:02:59.460\n So I do have a couple of trophy walleyes on the wall,\n\n1:02:59.460 --> 1:03:03.060\n but most of the time I throw the big ones back\n\n1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:05.020\n and put them back in there.\n\n1:03:05.020 --> 1:03:07.300\n I don't know if you know there's a book by Hemingway\n\n1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:08.700\n called Old Man in the Sea.\n\n1:03:09.580 --> 1:03:10.420\n Heard of it.\n\n1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:12.120\n Ernest Hemingway?\n\n1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:13.740\n Ernest Hemingway, yeah.\n\n1:03:13.740 --> 1:03:16.380\n And there's an old man that basically\n\n1:03:17.580 --> 1:03:19.800\n catches an 18 footer, but it can't pull it in,\n\n1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:20.640\n doesn't have the strength.\n\n1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:24.380\n So they together spend while the sharks eat away at it.\n\n1:03:24.380 --> 1:03:26.580\n I mean, this is very powerful story.\n\n1:03:26.580 --> 1:03:27.860\n I think one of the Nobel Prize,\n\n1:03:27.860 --> 1:03:30.940\n but he says, it's better to be lucky.\n\n1:03:30.940 --> 1:03:33.220\n The old man says, it's better to be lucky,\n\n1:03:33.220 --> 1:03:36.820\n but I would rather be exact that way\n\n1:03:36.820 --> 1:03:38.740\n when luck comes, you're ready.\n\n1:03:38.740 --> 1:03:43.300\n So let me ask, what do you think about luck?\n\n1:03:43.300 --> 1:03:47.180\n Do you believe in free will that we have actions\n\n1:03:47.180 --> 1:03:49.980\n that control the direction, destination of our life,\n\n1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:53.620\n or does luck and some other outside forces\n\n1:03:53.620 --> 1:03:56.740\n really land you where you end up?\n\n1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:00.480\n For me, I'm not about luck,\n\n1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:04.960\n but I do think luck is involved.\n\n1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:06.720\n But I think it's mostly created,\n\n1:04:07.900 --> 1:04:11.020\n just how lucky you are through preparations.\n\n1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:14.920\n And things have happened in my life forever,\n\n1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:18.340\n and a lot of good things.\n\n1:04:18.340 --> 1:04:19.580\n And a lot of people could say,\n\n1:04:19.580 --> 1:04:22.780\n hey, you've been pretty lucky to win all these awards.\n\n1:04:22.780 --> 1:04:27.180\n I don't know, if you analyze my life,\n\n1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:29.840\n I don't think it was involved with luck.\n\n1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:32.100\n I think it was more involved with preparation.\n\n1:04:32.100 --> 1:04:36.100\n And again, science, had you been smarter,\n\n1:04:36.100 --> 1:04:39.820\n had you understood that you could do some things\n\n1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:42.020\n and be just as lucky, that'd be great.\n\n1:04:42.020 --> 1:04:45.120\n But I'm only as smart as today.\n\n1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:48.280\n So when I was training in my life,\n\n1:04:48.280 --> 1:04:51.260\n and me even training people in my life,\n\n1:04:52.460 --> 1:04:54.860\n as of that moment, that's how lucky I am\n\n1:04:54.860 --> 1:04:59.860\n to be able to have whatever is available to me.\n\n1:05:00.140 --> 1:05:01.860\n And that's what, you call that a lot of science.\n\n1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:06.860\n So for me, I think that, like right now, if I look back,\n\n1:05:07.060 --> 1:05:09.300\n I do a lot of things different,\n\n1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:12.740\n just because things are proven differently.\n\n1:05:12.740 --> 1:05:17.380\n Like I'd give people water during practice, and I did.\n\n1:05:17.380 --> 1:05:20.100\n And I would let them change their wrestling shoes\n\n1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:23.460\n into running shoes to run sprints on the concrete.\n\n1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:27.980\n Or I would actually, maybe I've had a guy climb 12 ropes\n\n1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.360\n after practice, one after another.\n\n1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.460\n And then maybe the next day I'd do it again.\n\n1:05:32.460 --> 1:05:35.200\n Ah, I might not make him do it the next day.\n\n1:05:35.200 --> 1:05:38.180\n I might let him recover a little bit more.\n\n1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:43.180\n And you gotta learn, keep adding to your philosophy.\n\n1:05:43.660 --> 1:05:46.540\n And your philosophy may have been great at that time,\n\n1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:48.460\n but it's at that time.\n\n1:05:48.460 --> 1:05:51.500\n And what is really important is where you at\n\n1:05:51.500 --> 1:05:53.900\n with this time, today.\n\n1:05:53.900 --> 1:05:56.420\n And so there's better ways to do things.\n\n1:05:56.420 --> 1:05:59.040\n Now, if you ever take attitude out of it,\n\n1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:02.040\n and just depend on total science,\n\n1:06:03.300 --> 1:06:05.040\n then you're not gonna be as,\n\n1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:08.720\n as you know, I think as I listened to a couple people\n\n1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:11.640\n that are really pretty famous people.\n\n1:06:11.640 --> 1:06:13.040\n One of them was John Irving.\n\n1:06:13.040 --> 1:06:15.080\n He was a writer.\n\n1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:16.360\n And he told me, he says,\n\n1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:21.200\n you think I really learned how to be a great writer\n\n1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:24.660\n in writing school?\n\n1:06:26.920 --> 1:06:29.680\n He said, yeah, I learned a lot there.\n\n1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:34.680\n But really what gave me the ability to stay focused,\n\n1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:38.680\n to work extra hours, to be more disciplined,\n\n1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:40.320\n was wrestling practices.\n\n1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:42.800\n That's right, he was a wrestler, yeah.\n\n1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:44.720\n Yeah, he goes, I go back to that.\n\n1:06:44.720 --> 1:06:46.420\n That's what gave me that chance.\n\n1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:52.400\n And there's a guy in Iowa, that guy named Norman Borlaug.\n\n1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:57.400\n He learned, he invented a process\n\n1:06:57.640 --> 1:07:02.420\n to feed the underprivileged countries of the world.\n\n1:07:02.420 --> 1:07:06.680\n And he was a wrestler, and he said the same thing.\n\n1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:08.720\n And he worked extremely hard.\n\n1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:11.200\n And he said, I give a lot of credit\n\n1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:13.120\n to the sport of wrestling.\n\n1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.400\n And even though I'm known for this,\n\n1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:18.340\n and I got a statue in Washington, DC,\n\n1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:21.340\n because I saved a billion lives plus,\n\n1:07:21.340 --> 1:07:23.800\n I'm gonna give wrestling a lot of credit.\n\n1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:28.800\n So I think some of these MMA stars\n\n1:07:29.440 --> 1:07:32.940\n and some of these guys that maybe weren't wrestlers,\n\n1:07:32.940 --> 1:07:36.760\n that had to wrestle, had to fight wrestling guys and stuff,\n\n1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:38.280\n missed a little bit there.\n\n1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.560\n But I think the ones that did have wrestling\n\n1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:41.920\n probably have a really good chance\n\n1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:43.480\n and can adapt to the other ones.\n\n1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:48.320\n But I think every martial art or every activity is good,\n\n1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:49.800\n and you probably can't skip any.\n\n1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:51.920\n But I don't think they're ever gonna overlook\n\n1:07:51.920 --> 1:07:56.920\n and say that wrestling's not valuable, because it is.\n\n1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.560\n However, that doesn't mean you're gonna make it.\n\n1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:03.400\n You still gotta take the values and apply it,\n\n1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:05.640\n whatever area you're gonna be in.\n\n1:08:05.640 --> 1:08:07.400\n And some people forget that.\n\n1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:12.180\n Some people can't get over the highness\n\n1:08:12.180 --> 1:08:15.400\n of getting your arm raised in a wrestling match.\n\n1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:16.440\n And you know what?\n\n1:08:16.440 --> 1:08:20.080\n What's even greater than me getting my arm raised\n\n1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:23.300\n is that if I'm a coach or if I belong with you,\n\n1:08:23.300 --> 1:08:25.520\n that you get your arm raised.\n\n1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.360\n And even if you don't get your arm raised,\n\n1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.200\n it's what you walk away with\n\n1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:33.840\n and how you learn to handle that as well.\n\n1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:35.820\n Because there's gonna be some losses,\n\n1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:37.720\n but you don't want many.\n\n1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:39.580\n Because you don't wanna get used to losing,\n\n1:08:39.580 --> 1:08:40.520\n I can tell you that.\n\n1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:42.240\n So it's the hunger for the win.\n\n1:08:42.240 --> 1:08:45.320\n It's the brotherhood, the sisterhood of the wrestling room.\n\n1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:46.960\n And it's hard work and science\n\n1:08:46.960 --> 1:08:49.920\n that's gonna beat luck at the end of the day.\n\n1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:54.500\n Absolutely, that luck, I like luck,\n\n1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:57.920\n but I think it's created by the opportunity that...\n\n1:08:57.920 --> 1:08:58.880\n You make your luck.\n\n1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:00.120\n You make your luck, yeah.\n\n1:09:00.120 --> 1:09:01.960\n Dan, it was a huge honor.\n\n1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:03.840\n Thank you for welcoming me into your home\n\n1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:05.060\n and for having
