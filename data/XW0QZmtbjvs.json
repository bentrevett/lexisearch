Vitalik is the cofounder of Ethereum\n\n00:07.480 --> 00:09.600\n and one of the most influential people\n\n00:09.600 --> 00:13.240\n in cryptocurrency and technology broadly defined.\n\n00:13.240 --> 00:15.360\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:15.360 --> 00:18.320\n Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon, Indeed,\n\n00:18.320 --> 00:20.840\n Four Sigmatic, and BetterHelp.\n\n00:20.840 --> 00:24.280\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:24.280 --> 00:27.800\n As a side note, let me say that Ethereum, Bitcoin,\n\n00:27.800 --> 00:29.560\n and many other cryptocurrencies\n\n00:29.560 --> 00:33.560\n have been taking a wild ride of prices going up and down\n\n00:33.560 --> 00:35.100\n in the past few months.\n\n00:35.100 --> 00:38.700\n To me, the prices were never as important as the ideas,\n\n00:38.700 --> 00:41.140\n both technical and philosophical.\n\n00:41.140 --> 00:43.720\n Cryptocurrency has the potential to empower billions\n\n00:43.720 --> 00:46.600\n of people to participate in the global economy\n\n00:46.600 --> 00:48.840\n in a way that resists the manipulation\n\n00:48.840 --> 00:50.640\n by centralized power.\n\n00:50.640 --> 00:54.000\n Also with smart contracts, layer two technologies,\n\n00:54.000 --> 00:56.560\n data pools, NFTs, and of course,\n\n00:56.560 --> 00:58.920\n integration of artificial intelligence\n\n00:58.920 --> 01:01.040\n into the whole thing, we have the opportunity\n\n01:01.040 --> 01:04.680\n to build tools and worlds that transform physical\n\n01:04.680 --> 01:06.700\n and digital life as we know it,\n\n01:06.700 --> 01:09.700\n hopefully minimizing the suffering in the world\n\n01:09.700 --> 01:12.500\n and maximizing the fun.\n\n01:12.500 --> 01:14.960\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast\n\n01:14.960 --> 01:18.540\n and here is my conversation with Vitalik Buterin.\n\n01:19.540 --> 01:23.140\n Let's first talk about Shiba Inu, if we can.\n\n01:23.140 --> 01:27.320\n Also known as Shiba Token, code SHIB,\n\n01:27.320 --> 01:31.440\n for context, Shiba Inu was created in August 2020,\n\n01:31.440 --> 01:34.960\n modeled off of Dogecoin by the anonymous founder\n\n01:34.960 --> 01:37.380\n known as Ryoshi.\n\n01:37.380 --> 01:42.120\n On May 10th this year, it had a market capitalization\n\n01:42.120 --> 01:45.300\n of over 13 billion.\n\n01:45.300 --> 01:48.440\n And maybe you can explain this, but in a crazy move,\n\n01:48.440 --> 01:52.760\n you were given half of SHIB's total supply.\n\n01:52.760 --> 01:57.760\n You burned, a.k.a. destroyed 90% of it.\n\n01:58.480 --> 02:03.480\n That's worth $6.7 billion.\n\n02:03.480 --> 02:08.480\n And you donated 10%, that's worth 1.2 billion at the time\n\n02:09.800 --> 02:13.380\n to an India COVID 19 relief fund,\n\n02:13.380 --> 02:17.760\n saying you don't want to be the locus of this much power.\n\n02:17.760 --> 02:20.760\n This is fascinating.\n\n02:20.760 --> 02:23.620\n Why and how were you able to walk away\n\n02:23.620 --> 02:26.600\n from this much money and this much power?\n\n02:26.600 --> 02:31.040\n So I should probably start by giving some of the backstory\n\n02:31.040 --> 02:35.560\n around these coins and this concept of giving me coins.\n\n02:35.560 --> 02:38.440\n So first of all, Shiba Inu, as you said,\n\n02:38.440 --> 02:40.800\n is this kind of knockoff of Dogecoin, right?\n\n02:40.800 --> 02:44.480\n And Dogecoin was this initial kind of fun coin\n\n02:44.480 --> 02:47.320\n that was created back, I think, around 2014 or so.\n\n02:47.320 --> 02:50.000\n And it was just created by Jackson Palmer\n\n02:50.000 --> 02:52.240\n who put it out as a joke for a couple of hours\n\n02:52.240 --> 02:53.960\n and a community formed around it.\n\n02:53.960 --> 02:57.680\n And at the beginning, people didn't take it very seriously.\n\n02:57.680 --> 03:01.040\n I actually remember putting about $25,000 into Doge\n\n03:01.040 --> 03:02.360\n sometime around 2016.\n\n03:02.360 --> 03:05.600\n And I just remember thinking to myself,\n\n03:05.600 --> 03:08.880\n okay, how am I going to explain to my mom\n\n03:08.880 --> 03:12.520\n that I just invested $25,000 into Dogecoins?\n\n03:12.520 --> 03:14.200\n And what even are Dogecoins?\n\n03:14.200 --> 03:16.300\n The only interesting thing about this coin\n\n03:16.300 --> 03:19.840\n is that there's a logo of a dog somewhere.\n\n03:19.840 --> 03:21.960\n But of course, that ended up being one of the best\n\n03:21.960 --> 03:24.880\n investments I've ever made and it did really well.\n\n03:24.880 --> 03:28.600\n And then at the end of 2020, Elon Musk, of course,\n\n03:28.600 --> 03:31.920\n started talking about Dogecoin and the market cap\n\n03:31.920 --> 03:35.600\n just shot up to about $50 billion.\n\n03:35.600 --> 03:37.720\n Actually, it shot up multiple times, right?\n\n03:37.720 --> 03:40.920\n Like the first time it went up from about 0.8 cents\n\n03:40.920 --> 03:42.680\n to about like 7 cents.\n\n03:42.680 --> 03:44.160\n And this just happened all in one day.\n\n03:44.160 --> 03:48.440\n And I remember this was when I was still in Singapore\n\n03:48.440 --> 03:53.440\n in the middle of COVID and I saw that the price\n\n03:53.440 --> 03:56.080\n just went up by 1000% and I was like,\n\n03:56.080 --> 03:59.200\n oh my God, my Doge is worth like a lot.\n\n03:59.200 --> 04:02.800\n And so I immediately called up some of my friends\n\n04:02.800 --> 04:05.440\n and told them to like drop everything and scramble.\n\n04:05.440 --> 04:09.320\n And I sold half the Doge and I got $4.3 million,\n\n04:09.320 --> 04:11.360\n donated the proceeds to give directly.\n\n04:11.360 --> 04:13.640\n And a few hours after I did this,\n\n04:13.640 --> 04:16.480\n the price dropped back down from about 7 cents to 4 cents.\n\n04:16.480 --> 04:18.120\n So I managed to sell the Doge at the top\n\n04:18.120 --> 04:20.040\n and I remember just that feeling\n\n04:20.040 --> 04:22.240\n like I was such an amazing trader.\n\n04:22.240 --> 04:24.720\n But then of course, the price went up from 4 cents\n\n04:24.720 --> 04:28.560\n then to 7 and then 50 and just like Doge becoming\n\n04:28.560 --> 04:32.200\n this big phenomenon where there's even a lot of people\n\n04:32.200 --> 04:34.120\n that have heard of Doge that have not heard of Ethereum\n\n04:34.120 --> 04:36.800\n is just like something even I wasn't predicting, right?\n\n04:36.800 --> 04:38.960\n And so after that, of course, we have Doge\n\n04:38.960 --> 04:41.120\n and then people are thinking, well,\n\n04:41.120 --> 04:43.520\n if the leading DOG token is worth $50 billion,\n\n04:43.520 --> 04:47.720\n then surely the second largest DOG token deserves\n\n04:47.720 --> 04:49.680\n at least seven or 8 billion, right?\n\n04:49.680 --> 04:52.000\n Like, I feel like that's the kind of what the mindset\n\n04:52.000 --> 04:54.600\n of these Shiba people is.\n\n04:54.600 --> 04:57.080\n So that of course, they did this other gimmick, right?\n\n04:57.080 --> 04:59.880\n Where they gave me half the Shiba token supply.\n\n05:00.920 --> 05:03.480\n They were actually not the first projects to do this.\n\n05:03.480 --> 05:06.040\n So around the end of 2020,\n\n05:06.040 --> 05:08.720\n there was this weird project called Teller.\n\n05:08.720 --> 05:10.400\n It's like T E L L O R.\n\n05:10.400 --> 05:12.040\n I think they're a chain link competitor\n\n05:12.040 --> 05:13.280\n or something like this.\n\n05:13.280 --> 05:16.920\n But I remember they just like dumped $50,000\n\n05:16.920 --> 05:18.760\n worth of their token into my wallet.\n\n05:18.760 --> 05:20.120\n And then they had their Twitter army\n\n05:20.120 --> 05:22.040\n just like basically run around saying,\n\n05:22.040 --> 05:24.520\n look, look at Vitalik's wallet, Vitalik holds Tellers.\n\n05:24.520 --> 05:26.320\n He's one of us, he's a supporter.\n\n05:26.320 --> 05:27.800\n And as soon as I discovered this,\n\n05:27.800 --> 05:31.520\n I just like publicly sold the Teller tokens on Uniswap.\n\n05:31.520 --> 05:34.440\n And this created a bit of a Twitter splat.\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:36.880\n Now, the Shiba people were more clever.\n\n05:36.880 --> 05:39.240\n The Shiba people, instead of dumping to that wallet,\n\n05:39.240 --> 05:41.480\n they dumped to my cold wallet, right?\n\n05:41.480 --> 05:43.520\n So in a cryptocurrency, right,\n\n05:43.520 --> 05:45.720\n there's this concept of like cold wallets and hot wallets.\n\n05:45.720 --> 05:49.600\n Basically, like the thing that actually owns your money\n\n05:49.600 --> 05:52.800\n is like this 80 digit number called a private key, right?\n\n05:52.800 --> 05:54.520\n And a hot wallet is when that private key\n\n05:54.520 --> 05:56.680\n is just stored in memory on your computer,\n\n05:56.680 --> 05:58.840\n on your phone, really easy to access.\n\n05:58.840 --> 06:01.800\n Cold wallet means it's either written down\n\n06:01.800 --> 06:04.840\n on a piece of paper or it's on a computer\n\n06:04.840 --> 06:07.080\n that's just never accessed the internet, right?\n\n06:07.080 --> 06:08.440\n So cold is very inconvenient,\n\n06:08.440 --> 06:10.640\n but cold is also much more secure, right?\n\n06:10.640 --> 06:13.720\n Because even if that computer has some viruses on it,\n\n06:13.720 --> 06:15.920\n like it's like air gapped,\n\n06:15.920 --> 06:17.800\n it's not actually going to be able to upload it.\n\n06:17.800 --> 06:21.280\n So this cold wallet and like all the money\n\n06:21.280 --> 06:22.320\n is out of the cold wallet,\n\n06:22.320 --> 06:24.480\n so it's safe for me to talk about my setup now, right?\n\n06:24.480 --> 06:27.560\n But it was a laptop that was sitting in Canada.\n\n06:27.560 --> 06:30.920\n And I also had two pieces of paper\n\n06:30.920 --> 06:32.560\n where I wrote down two numbers\n\n06:32.560 --> 06:33.880\n on those two pieces of paper.\n\n06:33.880 --> 06:35.720\n One was with me, one was in Canada.\n\n06:35.720 --> 06:37.360\n And if you add those two numbers together,\n\n06:37.360 --> 06:38.760\n you get the private key.\n\n06:38.760 --> 06:41.320\n So because of COVID travel restrictions,\n\n06:41.320 --> 06:44.240\n and this cold wallets in Canada,\n\n06:44.240 --> 06:48.000\n like it's very difficult for me to actually access it, right?\n\n06:48.000 --> 06:49.960\n And I'm not sure if they knew this,\n\n06:49.960 --> 06:51.120\n maybe they just got lucky,\n\n06:51.120 --> 06:55.840\n but basically they sent a lot of these dog tokens\n\n06:55.840 --> 06:59.440\n into this wallet where it was very difficult\n\n06:59.440 --> 07:00.400\n for me to access it.\n\n07:00.400 --> 07:02.400\n But then I saw these dog tokens,\n\n07:02.400 --> 07:04.120\n I saw more and more people talking about them.\n\n07:04.120 --> 07:06.920\n And then at some point I realized that like,\n\n07:06.920 --> 07:09.240\n hey, these things are worth billions of dollars.\n\n07:09.240 --> 07:11.840\n And like, no, there's lots of really good things\n\n07:11.840 --> 07:13.080\n that you could do with that amount of money.\n\n07:13.080 --> 07:16.120\n And it would actually be a waste to just like see it go.\n\n07:16.120 --> 07:18.760\n So I made the decision that like,\n\n07:18.760 --> 07:20.200\n I would actually power through\n\n07:20.200 --> 07:23.000\n and figure out how to like safely,\n\n07:23.000 --> 07:24.960\n like basically get my private key.\n\n07:24.960 --> 07:27.240\n I actually had to call up my family,\n\n07:27.240 --> 07:29.200\n tell them to read out their number\n\n07:29.200 --> 07:30.640\n off of their piece of paper.\n\n07:30.640 --> 07:34.360\n I entered that into a fresh laptop\n\n07:34.360 --> 07:35.360\n that I bought from Target.\n\n07:35.360 --> 07:38.840\n Then I put in my other number on my piece of paper,\n\n07:38.840 --> 07:40.600\n added the two numbers together on the computer,\n\n07:40.600 --> 07:41.600\n there's the key.\n\n07:41.600 --> 07:45.520\n And at the same time, like just scrambled for two days,\n\n07:45.520 --> 07:47.000\n setting up a new wallet\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.800\n where I could move my ETH to safely,\n\n07:48.800 --> 07:50.760\n like getting people to be multisig partners,\n\n07:50.760 --> 07:53.920\n just like doing all sorts of like stuff\n\n07:53.920 --> 07:56.000\n that 10 years ago you would expect\n\n07:56.000 --> 07:58.640\n to just be part of a cyberpunk science fiction novel,\n\n07:58.640 --> 07:59.960\n but now it's all real.\n\n07:59.960 --> 08:03.120\n So you're doing this all by yourself, essentially.\n\n08:03.120 --> 08:04.280\n Most of it by myself.\n\n08:04.280 --> 08:05.760\n So you have to keep it secret.\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:09.560\n Right, and I needed my family to actually like go\n\n08:09.560 --> 08:12.200\n and read the number on their piece of paper.\n\n08:12.200 --> 08:15.640\n And then in my new multisig wallet,\n\n08:15.640 --> 08:19.120\n like there's other people that are signatories,\n\n08:19.120 --> 08:22.960\n but I'm obviously not gonna reveal any details beyond that.\n\n08:22.960 --> 08:24.760\n So I did this, right?\n\n08:24.760 --> 08:28.120\n And I actually managed to like get the private key,\n\n08:28.120 --> 08:30.800\n make the first transaction that would just move all my ETH\n\n08:30.800 --> 08:32.680\n to the multisig wallet so it's safe.\n\n08:32.680 --> 08:34.800\n And then second transact,\n\n08:34.800 --> 08:36.400\n put the private key on my main computer,\n\n08:36.400 --> 08:39.520\n then started going in and just selling some\n\n08:39.520 --> 08:41.480\n of the dog tokens and then just like giving them\n\n08:41.480 --> 08:43.400\n to these different charities.\n\n08:43.400 --> 08:48.400\n Now, at the time I actually did not even like have any idea\n\n08:49.200 --> 08:50.600\n of how much you would be able to get, right?\n\n08:50.600 --> 08:53.840\n Because like on paper, the dog tokens are $7 billion,\n\n08:53.840 --> 08:56.480\n but like in reality, it's a very liquid market.\n\n08:56.480 --> 09:00.200\n Are you gonna crash it after you sell 1 million worth\n\n09:00.200 --> 09:03.000\n or are you gonna crash it after 10 million?\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.760\n Might you actually be able to get like an entire 200 million?\n\n09:06.760 --> 09:07.840\n I had no idea.\n\n09:08.760 --> 09:12.840\n So I definitely was just over the mindset,\n\n09:12.840 --> 09:14.560\n like, okay, I mean, I'll sell a bit,\n\n09:14.560 --> 09:17.280\n maybe I get some ETH and then donated some ETH\n\n09:17.280 --> 09:19.160\n to give well, donated some to other groups.\n\n09:19.160 --> 09:21.000\n And then, okay, have some dog tokens.\n\n09:21.000 --> 09:23.360\n Like I don't have an easy ability to sell more myself,\n\n09:23.360 --> 09:25.720\n but then I'll just like give them to these groups\n\n09:25.720 --> 09:29.000\n and like, hopefully they'll do good things with them.\n\n09:29.000 --> 09:32.040\n It was actually, I actually donated at 20%\n\n09:32.040 --> 09:33.880\n then dumped 80%.\n\n09:33.880 --> 09:38.440\n Yeah, so the COVID India group got one batch\n\n09:38.440 --> 09:40.920\n and then there's another group that got another batch.\n\n09:40.920 --> 09:42.360\n And I don't wanna say who they are\n\n09:42.360 --> 09:44.440\n cause I think that they wanna announce themselves\n\n09:44.440 --> 09:45.280\n at some point.\n\n09:45.280 --> 09:46.120\n Sure.\n\n09:46.120 --> 09:48.480\n Yeah, but you can see the fact\n\n09:48.480 --> 09:50.800\n that these transactions were made on the blockchain,\n\n09:50.800 --> 09:55.800\n but it was just very interesting and unexpected\n\n09:57.160 --> 10:00.760\n and just an insanely crazy situation.\n\n10:00.760 --> 10:02.880\n It's been a couple of weeks.\n\n10:02.880 --> 10:06.000\n First of all, thank you for helping me hang up some curtains.\n\n10:06.000 --> 10:08.400\n This is a first for the podcast\n\n10:08.400 --> 10:12.120\n and shows that you're a truly a special person\n\n10:13.520 --> 10:14.760\n to be willing to help.\n\n10:14.760 --> 10:16.600\n But now a couple of weeks later,\n\n10:16.600 --> 10:19.220\n do you regret any aspect of that decision?\n\n10:20.480 --> 10:21.680\n I'm sure there is some things\n\n10:21.680 --> 10:23.600\n that I probably could have done better.\n\n10:23.600 --> 10:27.720\n Like I was actually talking to some of these charities\n\n10:27.720 --> 10:30.960\n and I was impressed by just how much money they managed\n\n10:30.960 --> 10:32.840\n to get out of selling some of these coins.\n\n10:32.840 --> 10:35.760\n So I probably could have done better\n\n10:35.760 --> 10:38.560\n by just talking more with the traders\n\n10:38.560 --> 10:43.440\n and actually ensuring that they can do a better job\n\n10:43.440 --> 10:48.440\n of maximizing the value of all of them.\n\n10:48.760 --> 10:52.320\n But it was a very stressful time\n\n10:52.320 --> 10:53.680\n and I did have to act quickly.\n\n10:53.680 --> 10:57.240\n Like I did manage to make a lot of the donations\n\n10:57.240 --> 11:01.200\n before, a few days before the great crypto crash happened.\n\n11:01.200 --> 11:06.200\n So it was, it's difficult to,\n\n11:06.400 --> 11:08.860\n obviously there's parallel universes in which I did better,\n\n11:08.860 --> 11:10.160\n but at the same time,\n\n11:10.160 --> 11:12.400\n there's also lots of parallel universes\n\n11:12.400 --> 11:14.320\n where because I hesitated more\n\n11:14.320 --> 11:16.120\n and tried to spend more time thinking I missed\n\n11:16.120 --> 11:17.600\n the opportunity.\n\n11:17.600 --> 11:20.520\n So on that, it's like a luck of the draw\n\n11:20.520 --> 11:25.520\n and I'm just happy that everything was able to turn out\n\n11:25.520 --> 11:27.280\n as well as it did.\n\n11:27.280 --> 11:30.280\n But psychologically, you mentioned stress.\n\n11:30.280 --> 11:31.280\n How hard was it?\n\n11:32.240 --> 11:33.240\n It was stressful, right?\n\n11:33.240 --> 11:35.540\n I think, well, one of the really stressful parts\n\n11:35.540 --> 11:39.240\n was just the fact that I had to basically move\n\n11:39.240 --> 11:42.760\n all of my funds, including the 325,000 ether\n\n11:42.760 --> 11:45.040\n from one cold wallet into another hot wallet,\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:47.400\n or sorry, into another multi SIG wallet.\n\n11:48.240 --> 11:50.880\n And maybe the multi SIG wallet had a bug in it.\n\n11:50.880 --> 11:53.800\n Maybe there's like some mistake I'll make in the middle\n\n11:53.800 --> 11:55.760\n that causes the funds to get lost.\n\n11:55.760 --> 11:58.800\n You know, that part was stressful.\n\n11:58.800 --> 12:01.880\n And I was definitely stressing out for two days.\n\n12:01.880 --> 12:03.560\n I mean, triple checking the new wallet.\n\n12:03.560 --> 12:05.660\n I even did a bit of an audit of the code myself.\n\n12:05.660 --> 12:10.040\n I wrote my own JavaScript to DAP to make confirmations\n\n12:10.040 --> 12:14.000\n because Gnosis Safe didn't work with the status wallet well.\n\n12:14.000 --> 12:16.520\n So there was definitely,\n\n12:16.520 --> 12:19.600\n that whole thing was definitely a bit of a marathon.\n\n12:19.600 --> 12:23.440\n I was also a kind of definitely a bit worried\n\n12:23.440 --> 12:26.640\n about or uncertain, I guess, how the public\n\n12:26.640 --> 12:28.920\n and including the coin communities\n\n12:28.920 --> 12:30.420\n would perceive the whole thing.\n\n12:31.960 --> 12:33.520\n But I was actually impressed.\n\n12:33.520 --> 12:36.800\n Like I, for every poster that was saying like,\n\n12:36.800 --> 12:40.880\n no, you know, why did Vitalik like rug pull on us?\n\n12:40.880 --> 12:44.640\n He was, his wallet was supposed to be a burn address.\n\n12:44.640 --> 12:46.760\n You know, there's like 10 people that are like,\n\n12:46.760 --> 12:49.080\n oh, you know, I thought I was just in this\n\n12:49.080 --> 12:52.000\n because it's a fun pyramid gambling thing.\n\n12:52.000 --> 12:54.680\n But instead I ended up being part of this, you know,\n\n12:54.680 --> 12:56.320\n great public good thing for humanity.\n\n12:56.320 --> 12:58.360\n And that's like even more amazing.\n\n12:58.360 --> 13:03.360\n So the amounts of that that I got was very impressive.\n\n13:03.640 --> 13:05.120\n So, you know, all in all, you know,\n\n13:05.120 --> 13:07.640\n I think the dog people did great.\n\n13:07.640 --> 13:08.520\n The dog people.\n\n13:08.520 --> 13:10.600\n Is there something you can extend\n\n13:10.600 --> 13:11.960\n to the bigger picture of it\n\n13:12.960 --> 13:15.640\n in the principles you apply to making this decision?\n\n13:15.640 --> 13:18.280\n Is there some principles, philosophies\n\n13:18.280 --> 13:22.240\n that you apply also to the decisions you make\n\n13:22.240 --> 13:23.440\n around Ethereum?\n\n13:24.800 --> 13:28.520\n I think a big one for me is just this idea\n\n13:28.520 --> 13:32.800\n that crypto, you know, isn't just an opportunity\n\n13:32.800 --> 13:35.800\n to give people like slightly better ways\n\n13:35.800 --> 13:37.880\n to save value in all of these things.\n\n13:37.880 --> 13:42.000\n Like it's also an opportunity to like basically create\n\n13:42.000 --> 13:44.520\n these like new digital institutions\n\n13:44.520 --> 13:47.140\n that could serve the public good in new ways.\n\n13:47.140 --> 13:50.880\n And that's something that I've been interested in\n\n13:50.880 --> 13:51.720\n for a long time.\n\n13:51.720 --> 13:55.000\n I actually even have this article in Bitcoin Magazine\n\n13:55.000 --> 13:58.400\n back in 2014, where I basically suggested this idea\n\n13:58.400 --> 14:00.920\n that, you know, you would have coins that represent causes\n\n14:00.920 --> 14:03.760\n and like people would just like buy and accept those coins\n\n14:03.760 --> 14:05.400\n because they support those causes.\n\n14:05.400 --> 14:09.120\n So I think it's called markets, institutions, and currencies,\n\n14:09.120 --> 14:11.520\n a new form of social incentivization or something like that.\n\n14:11.520 --> 14:14.320\n And I'm sure you can find it and throw it in the links.\n\n14:14.320 --> 14:19.320\n So that was interesting to kind of see becoming real.\n\n14:19.620 --> 14:21.940\n And like in general, I think, you know,\n\n14:21.940 --> 14:23.420\n public goods are very important\n\n14:23.420 --> 14:26.460\n and on the internet, public goods are even more important.\n\n14:26.460 --> 14:30.300\n Like every single Lex Friedman podcast is just on YouTube\n\n14:30.300 --> 14:31.980\n and no anyone can go and see it.\n\n14:31.980 --> 14:35.740\n Like there's no way for you to like, you know, sell it\n\n14:35.740 --> 14:37.740\n and so that some people can see it,\n\n14:37.740 --> 14:38.920\n but then other people can't see it.\n\n14:38.920 --> 14:40.000\n Like, you know, you could do that,\n\n14:40.000 --> 14:42.860\n but then you'd obviously be reducing your impact.\n\n14:42.860 --> 14:47.100\n So thank you for making the amazing Lex Friedman podcast\n\n14:47.100 --> 14:48.260\n so freely available.\n\n14:48.260 --> 14:51.940\n Well, that's actually a tense thing is how do you do it\n\n14:51.940 --> 14:55.620\n in a way that's not controlled in a centralized fashion?\n\n14:55.620 --> 14:59.140\n Cause actually YouTube feels free and open,\n\n14:59.140 --> 15:00.700\n but it nevertheless is one company\n\n15:00.700 --> 15:01.980\n making centralized decisions.\n\n15:01.980 --> 15:05.780\n And the first time I realized YouTube is not forever\n\n15:05.780 --> 15:10.020\n is when a lot of the Joe Rogan experience library\n\n15:10.020 --> 15:13.460\n was pulled from YouTube as part of the Spotify deal.\n\n15:13.460 --> 15:17.080\n And it made me realize we need to,\n\n15:17.080 --> 15:20.860\n it's like the realization that fiat money is centralized\n\n15:20.860 --> 15:25.740\n is realizing that, you know, this is not forever\n\n15:25.740 --> 15:28.740\n and you might want to come up with schemes to distribute it,\n\n15:28.740 --> 15:31.480\n to decentralize the control of it\n\n15:31.480 --> 15:34.620\n in a way that audio for podcasts is just an RSS feed.\n\n15:34.620 --> 15:35.460\n Exactly.\n\n15:35.460 --> 15:38.080\n And I think one of the kind of philosophical things\n\n15:38.080 --> 15:40.860\n that I hope to achieve is kind of decouple\n\n15:40.860 --> 15:42.720\n the concept of public goods,\n\n15:42.720 --> 15:44.460\n which are incredibly important\n\n15:44.460 --> 15:46.820\n and are the lifeblood of modern civilization\n\n15:46.820 --> 15:50.980\n from the idea that there is or can be\n\n15:50.980 --> 15:53.780\n one central organization that represents the public\n\n15:53.780 --> 15:57.540\n and like perfectly understands and can impose their idea\n\n15:57.540 --> 15:58.960\n of what is the good, right?\n\n15:58.960 --> 16:02.340\n Like it's, when people talk about public goods,\n\n16:02.340 --> 16:05.260\n it just often comes with this baggage of, you know,\n\n16:05.260 --> 16:07.380\n either centralization or conformism.\n\n16:07.380 --> 16:09.460\n And I think like it doesn't have to, right?\n\n16:09.460 --> 16:12.260\n Like often the most important public goods\n\n16:12.260 --> 16:14.380\n are the ones that are created by, you know,\n\n16:14.380 --> 16:17.560\n the crazy individualists that disagree with everyone else.\n\n16:17.560 --> 16:21.260\n So trying to make this kind of synthesis\n\n16:21.260 --> 16:24.740\n where you combine the values of decentralization\n\n16:24.740 --> 16:26.420\n and the values of open source,\n\n16:26.420 --> 16:29.100\n but you're not naive about it.\n\n16:29.100 --> 16:31.700\n And like, you know, you realize that\n\n16:31.700 --> 16:33.700\n for these things to be produced,\n\n16:33.700 --> 16:36.060\n there needs to be a way for it to be sustainable.\n\n16:36.060 --> 16:38.340\n There needs to be some way of supporting people\n\n16:38.340 --> 16:39.900\n who are working these projects.\n\n16:39.900 --> 16:40.940\n But at the same time,\n\n16:40.940 --> 16:44.300\n you want to avoid that turning into\n\n16:44.300 --> 16:45.780\n a vector of centralization,\n\n16:45.780 --> 16:49.980\n like trying to sort of get all of the good things\n\n16:49.980 --> 16:50.940\n without the bad things.\n\n16:50.940 --> 16:55.480\n To me, that's a big part of sort of\n\n16:55.480 --> 16:58.100\n what my grand experiment in crypto is about.\n\n16:58.100 --> 17:00.060\n And like, we are doing things\n\n17:00.060 --> 17:02.540\n in different kinds of things for this, right?\n\n17:02.540 --> 17:05.620\n Like there's the Gitcoin Grants quadratic funding\n\n17:05.620 --> 17:07.500\n in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n17:07.500 --> 17:10.380\n There's obviously these dog coins\n\n17:10.380 --> 17:13.120\n that just happens, I guess, accidentally.\n\n17:14.040 --> 17:17.740\n There's other projects that, like for example,\n\n17:17.740 --> 17:21.020\n you know, Uniswap has their Uniswap DAO\n\n17:21.020 --> 17:22.620\n that just has a huge amount of funding.\n\n17:22.620 --> 17:25.620\n And like, we haven't seen yet how that's going to be deployed,\n\n17:25.620 --> 17:28.540\n but, you know, it could be potentially deployed\n\n17:28.540 --> 17:31.640\n to do lots of really good and amazing things.\n\n17:31.640 --> 17:36.020\n Do you see Ethereum as essentially a mechanism\n\n17:36.020 --> 17:38.700\n to fight for social causes?\n\n17:41.160 --> 17:46.160\n I definitely see Ethereum as being a mechanism\n\n17:46.700 --> 17:51.700\n to fight for definitely some specific things\n\n17:52.180 --> 17:54.900\n that are social causes.\n\n17:54.900 --> 17:57.100\n Like just, you know,\n\n17:57.100 --> 17:59.600\n the fact of creating an open financial system\n\n17:59.600 --> 18:00.920\n that anyone can participate in\n\n18:00.920 --> 18:02.280\n no matter where they are in the world,\n\n18:02.280 --> 18:03.660\n that's a social cause.\n\n18:03.660 --> 18:05.760\n Just, you know, giving people the ability\n\n18:05.760 --> 18:08.180\n to organize and create projects,\n\n18:08.180 --> 18:10.580\n even if it's five people in five different countries.\n\n18:10.580 --> 18:12.260\n I think that kind of inclusiveness,\n\n18:12.260 --> 18:14.140\n I think that's a social cause\n\n18:14.140 --> 18:17.320\n and it's a core crypto value.\n\n18:18.820 --> 18:21.860\n But then at the same time, like the other important\n\n18:21.860 --> 18:23.740\n and if part of the magic of Ethereum\n\n18:23.740 --> 18:25.100\n that you have to balance that against\n\n18:25.100 --> 18:27.820\n is that it is also this open platform\n\n18:27.820 --> 18:29.220\n where ultimately, you know,\n\n18:29.220 --> 18:31.900\n the things that are on Ethereum\n\n18:31.900 --> 18:34.400\n is just the things that the community makes of it.\n\n18:35.540 --> 18:37.660\n Well, you kind of briefly opened the door,\n\n18:37.660 --> 18:39.580\n so let's go there.\n\n18:39.580 --> 18:42.820\n When it comes to government regulation of crypto,\n\n18:44.780 --> 18:46.140\n what's the best case scenario?\n\n18:46.140 --> 18:48.460\n What's the worst case scenario?\n\n18:48.460 --> 18:52.580\n In terms of, you know, as you've kind of mentioned,\n\n18:52.580 --> 18:57.020\n Ethereum challenges the power centers of the world\n\n18:57.020 --> 19:01.980\n and how do you see the interplay between governments\n\n19:01.980 --> 19:05.220\n and this new technology that resists centralized power?\n\n19:06.220 --> 19:08.080\n Best case and worst case.\n\n19:08.080 --> 19:13.080\n The best case is that, you know,\n\n19:14.460 --> 19:17.020\n blockchains continue to prosper\n\n19:17.020 --> 19:18.700\n and we figure out scalability\n\n19:18.700 --> 19:22.380\n so that people can actually start doing things on block,\n\n19:22.380 --> 19:24.660\n like, you know, all of the amazing use cases\n\n19:24.660 --> 19:25.820\n that people have been talking about\n\n19:25.820 --> 19:28.420\n instead of today where a lot of the great stuff\n\n19:28.420 --> 19:29.860\n gets priced out because, you know,\n\n19:29.860 --> 19:32.140\n transaction fees are at five to $10\n\n19:32.140 --> 19:36.420\n and then we see a lot of different amazing applications\n\n19:36.420 --> 19:37.500\n happening on blockchains.\n\n19:37.500 --> 19:41.820\n You know, it could be like DAO is creating new ways\n\n19:41.820 --> 19:44.900\n for people to interact and organize with each other\n\n19:44.900 --> 19:46.580\n and new ways for artists to get funded\n\n19:46.580 --> 19:50.120\n and just all sorts of these amazing things\n\n19:50.120 --> 19:55.120\n and there's just enough public support\n\n19:55.900 --> 19:57.820\n and just enough people that see that, you know,\n\n19:57.820 --> 20:01.300\n look, crypto is clearly doing a lot of good things\n\n20:01.300 --> 20:03.620\n and, you know, there are definitely areas\n\n20:03.620 --> 20:04.700\n where there's tensions,\n\n20:04.700 --> 20:08.200\n but in those areas where there's tensions,\n\n20:08.200 --> 20:10.500\n like, there could be some kind of creative\n\n20:10.500 --> 20:13.060\n and interesting approaches that get figured out, right?\n\n20:13.060 --> 20:16.300\n Like, you know, the concept of corporate taxes,\n\n20:16.300 --> 20:17.140\n for example, right?\n\n20:17.140 --> 20:21.060\n Like, you know, that would disappear as a revenue stream\n\n20:21.060 --> 20:23.780\n if theoretically corporations just all get replaced by DAOs\n\n20:23.780 --> 20:28.220\n but, you know, like maybe there's some other creative way\n\n20:28.220 --> 20:33.220\n by which DAOs themselves can kind of be code,\n\n20:34.680 --> 20:36.480\n you know, have some kind of encoded governance\n\n20:36.480 --> 20:41.120\n that ensures that they have at least some kind of bias\n\n20:41.120 --> 20:43.260\n towards serving the global public good\n\n20:43.260 --> 20:47.660\n and, you know, maybe DAOs can do enough of that\n\n20:47.660 --> 20:48.900\n that people are happy with it.\n\n20:48.900 --> 20:51.100\n And, you know, there are going to be things\n\n20:51.100 --> 20:52.220\n that people are unhappy about.\n\n20:52.220 --> 20:53.420\n There's always gonna be the people\n\n20:53.420 --> 20:55.700\n that, you know, wants to surveil everyone\n\n20:55.700 --> 21:00.700\n but if the kind of effect of crypto\n\n21:01.380 --> 21:04.300\n from just empowering people is greater than that\n\n21:04.300 --> 21:05.360\n and greater than that in a way\n\n21:05.360 --> 21:07.200\n that people can just easily see,\n\n21:07.200 --> 21:09.280\n then, you know, that would be a good scenario, right?\n\n21:09.280 --> 21:13.580\n And we'll just become kind of incorporated and accepted\n\n21:13.580 --> 21:16.500\n the same way as happened with the internet.\n\n21:16.500 --> 21:19.820\n But in the worst case scenario would, of course,\n\n21:19.820 --> 21:23.340\n be just like people suddenly, you know,\n\n21:23.340 --> 21:25.460\n flipping and going into moral panic mode\n\n21:25.460 --> 21:27.000\n and just, you know, oh my God,\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:29.500\n like this technology is used by like, you know,\n\n21:29.500 --> 21:31.180\n insert bad group over the day.\n\n21:31.180 --> 21:33.780\n And then I don't think governments have the ability\n\n21:33.780 --> 21:36.940\n to ban crypto to the extent of just complete\n\n21:36.940 --> 21:39.340\n like preventing blockchains from existing\n\n21:39.340 --> 21:40.740\n but they definitely have the ability\n\n21:40.740 --> 21:42.460\n to really marginalize it, right?\n\n21:42.460 --> 21:45.300\n Like if you just ban all exchanges,\n\n21:45.300 --> 21:48.380\n like in ban all links from the Fiat ecosystem to crypto\n\n21:48.380 --> 21:51.420\n and, you know, you ban all kind of mainstream employers\n\n21:51.420 --> 21:54.660\n from accepting or paying in cryptocurrency,\n\n21:54.660 --> 21:59.660\n then like you can successfully like turn it into a,\n\n22:01.100 --> 22:03.940\n like, you know, a fairly kind of niche countercultural thing\n\n22:03.940 --> 22:07.540\n that has much less impact than otherwise would.\n\n22:07.540 --> 22:09.860\n So it's somewhere between the good scenario\n\n22:09.860 --> 22:10.680\n and the bad scenario.\n\n22:10.680 --> 22:12.460\n I'm obviously hoping for the good.\n\n22:12.460 --> 22:14.020\n Well, that's interesting also the tension\n\n22:14.020 --> 22:17.620\n between governments and companies.\n\n22:17.620 --> 22:19.300\n Like if you have a bunch of billionaires\n\n22:19.300 --> 22:22.100\n or a bunch of companies like Tesla investing in Bitcoin\n\n22:22.100 --> 22:24.700\n and then governments resisting that,\n\n22:24.700 --> 22:27.740\n it's interesting who wins out in that worst case scenario.\n\n22:27.740 --> 22:34.020\n And almost when companies and rich, quote unquote,\n\n22:34.020 --> 22:37.840\n respectable people embrace cryptocurrencies,\n\n22:37.840 --> 22:41.780\n Bitcoin, Ethereum, so on, even the dot coins,\n\n22:41.780 --> 22:44.180\n it's almost sends a signal to everybody else\n\n22:44.180 --> 22:48.080\n that this is a revolution that's here to stay.\n\n22:49.300 --> 22:51.600\n On this one little tangent that you brought up,\n\n22:52.500 --> 22:55.900\n this is almost an outdated idea, but it's still with us,\n\n22:55.900 --> 22:59.740\n which is cryptocurrencies are used for illegal activity,\n\n22:59.740 --> 23:02.060\n for drugs, for crime, and so on.\n\n23:02.940 --> 23:05.820\n Is there some sense that worries you\n\n23:05.820 --> 23:10.820\n that if cryptocurrency, if Ethereum runs the world,\n\n23:11.900 --> 23:16.900\n then making money from crime will be easier?\n\n23:17.060 --> 23:20.320\n There's always that possibility, but like at the same time,\n\n23:20.320 --> 23:23.180\n I think if you look at, you know, the world as a whole\n\n23:23.180 --> 23:26.260\n and like the way all the other technological trends\n\n23:26.260 --> 23:28.500\n are going, like, you know, in person surveillance\n\n23:28.500 --> 23:30.420\n is just going up every year, right?\n\n23:30.420 --> 23:34.260\n Like if you commit a crime in, you know, meat space,\n\n23:34.260 --> 23:36.700\n it's getting harder and harder to get away with it.\n\n23:36.700 --> 23:40.120\n So like, you know, if you wants to do something,\n\n23:40.120 --> 23:42.560\n and this is something that's just like happening\n\n23:42.560 --> 23:45.060\n as a result of, you know, just better technology\n\n23:45.060 --> 23:46.900\n and information transparency,\n\n23:46.900 --> 23:51.100\n like a lot of it's hard to prevent even if you really tried.\n\n23:51.100 --> 23:56.100\n So the world where like things go dark to such an extent,\n\n23:57.820 --> 24:01.580\n you know, as the police hawks sometimes like to say,\n\n24:01.580 --> 24:04.340\n to such an extent that like, you know, oh my God,\n\n24:04.340 --> 24:06.340\n the criminals are committing crimes with impunity\n\n24:06.340 --> 24:09.820\n and we can't see anything, like that just seems unlikely.\n\n24:09.820 --> 24:11.540\n But, you know, on the other hand,\n\n24:11.540 --> 24:16.540\n like the world where there just, you know,\n\n24:16.540 --> 24:21.540\n is no privacy, for example, or the world where there just\n\n24:21.900 --> 24:26.900\n like is no ability to kind of act outside of the confines\n\n24:28.940 --> 24:30.740\n of, you know, mainstream institutions,\n\n24:30.740 --> 24:34.860\n like that's something that's more realistic\n\n24:34.860 --> 24:37.940\n and that seems like something that could lead\n\n24:37.940 --> 24:40.820\n to a lot of kind of a lot of scary things, right?\n\n24:40.820 --> 24:42.820\n And like, even from a government's point of view, right?\n\n24:42.820 --> 24:45.220\n Like I think governments over the last few years,\n\n24:45.220 --> 24:47.860\n a lot of them, they're very worried about sovereignty.\n\n24:47.860 --> 24:49.020\n You know, they're worried about like,\n\n24:49.020 --> 24:53.540\n if their country is economies and, you know,\n\n24:53.540 --> 24:55.940\n social environments are just completely dependent\n\n24:55.940 --> 24:58.180\n on basically foreign tech companies controlled\n\n24:58.180 --> 24:59.620\n by foreign governments, like, you know,\n\n24:59.620 --> 25:01.220\n governments are not on team government, right?\n\n25:01.220 --> 25:04.180\n It's like, you know, the Indian government is on,\n\n25:04.180 --> 25:06.380\n you know, team India, then the Russian government\n\n25:06.380 --> 25:08.140\n is on team Russia and so forth, right?\n\n25:08.140 --> 25:12.660\n So like, you know, they don't want the US to be able\n\n25:12.660 --> 25:14.980\n to like have this big backdoor into everything.\n\n25:14.980 --> 25:17.980\n So, I mean, I do think that a balance is needed,\n\n25:17.980 --> 25:22.980\n but at the same time, I do think,\n\n25:24.940 --> 25:28.700\n I guess I definitely like worry more\n\n25:28.700 --> 25:33.700\n about the possibility that just like without things\n\n25:35.220 --> 25:38.740\n to like crypto kind of acting outside of institutions\n\n25:38.740 --> 25:40.860\n becomes too impossible.\n\n25:40.860 --> 25:42.660\n And I don't even necessarily mean outside of governments,\n\n25:42.660 --> 25:44.260\n even just, you know, outside of corporations,\n\n25:44.260 --> 25:45.420\n like becomes too impossible.\n\n25:45.420 --> 25:46.580\n And there's just like terrible things\n\n25:46.580 --> 25:48.340\n that come as a result.\n\n25:48.340 --> 25:50.220\n I mean, if things going in the other direction,\n\n25:50.220 --> 25:54.460\n like it obviously is a risk, but no,\n\n25:54.460 --> 25:56.780\n at the same time, I think in the longterm,\n\n25:56.780 --> 26:01.620\n like a crypto can potentially even like offer defenses\n\n26:01.620 --> 26:03.420\n as much as attacks against that sort of thing.\n\n26:03.420 --> 26:05.460\n Yeah, many throughout history,\n\n26:05.460 --> 26:07.300\n many of the most destructive things came\n\n26:07.300 --> 26:10.260\n from centralized institutions versus sort of\n\n26:10.260 --> 26:13.100\n from the people operating in the shadows.\n\n26:13.100 --> 26:15.420\n And, you know, I've been talking to a bunch\n\n26:15.420 --> 26:18.140\n of psychedelics folks that people doing researches\n\n26:18.140 --> 26:21.420\n like Rick Doblin in Johns Hopkins,\n\n26:21.420 --> 26:23.780\n there's a lot of exciting research on psychedelics.\n\n26:23.780 --> 26:26.380\n And one thing you could say about operating\n\n26:26.380 --> 26:28.420\n at the edge of legality,\n\n26:28.420 --> 26:32.460\n it could actually accelerate the adoption\n\n26:32.460 --> 26:36.460\n of particular things like whether it's marijuana\n\n26:36.460 --> 26:39.220\n or psychedelics, they can help people out.\n\n26:39.220 --> 26:41.460\n It's almost accelerates the policy.\n\n26:41.460 --> 26:43.340\n It forces the policy to catch up\n\n26:43.340 --> 26:44.820\n to where the people stand.\n\n26:44.820 --> 26:47.180\n So there's a positive way of doing things\n\n26:47.180 --> 26:49.460\n that are in the gray area of legality\n\n26:49.460 --> 26:51.540\n and creating a market that allows people\n\n26:51.540 --> 26:55.540\n to in a safe way be able to participate\n\n26:55.540 --> 26:57.060\n in this gray area of legality.\n\n26:57.060 --> 26:58.660\n The other thing to keep in mind, of course,\n\n26:58.660 --> 27:01.660\n is that the set of like the kinds of things\n\n27:01.660 --> 27:03.940\n that just like payment processors as companies\n\n27:03.940 --> 27:06.700\n try to restrict you from is much larger\n\n27:06.700 --> 27:08.740\n than the set of things that's illegal, right?\n\n27:08.740 --> 27:10.420\n Like part of that is because they wanna be\n\n27:10.420 --> 27:12.780\n super conservative and like the more layers you have,\n\n27:12.780 --> 27:14.700\n the more they're like conservative\n\n27:14.700 --> 27:17.300\n because they're scared of what the layer below them\n\n27:17.300 --> 27:18.940\n will do to them.\n\n27:18.940 --> 27:21.540\n Sometimes they have their own moral opinions\n\n27:21.540 --> 27:23.180\n of various kinds.\n\n27:23.180 --> 27:24.460\n They go after lots of people, right?\n\n27:24.460 --> 27:27.140\n Like they make life really hard for sex workers,\n\n27:27.140 --> 27:30.300\n for example, psychedelics, as you mentioned,\n\n27:30.300 --> 27:34.660\n there's a lot of activity,\n\n27:34.660 --> 27:37.420\n even including stuff that is totally legal\n\n27:37.420 --> 27:40.940\n that just there's this like shadow\n\n27:40.940 --> 27:42.700\n like PayPal credit card governments\n\n27:42.700 --> 27:43.740\n or whatever you wanna call it.\n\n27:43.740 --> 27:47.980\n And that makes it just hard to participate in this stuff.\n\n27:47.980 --> 27:50.380\n So I think like reducing the number of intermediaries\n\n27:50.380 --> 27:54.740\n is definitely normally a good thing.\n\n27:54.740 --> 27:58.060\n All right, let's talk about one of the most exciting\n\n27:58.060 --> 28:01.820\n technologies like technically, philosophically,\n\n28:01.820 --> 28:05.100\n like socially, financially in every way,\n\n28:05.100 --> 28:07.660\n which is Ethereum 2.0.\n\n28:07.660 --> 28:10.460\n There's a million things to talk about,\n\n28:10.460 --> 28:14.020\n but step one is probably a good thing to do,\n\n28:14.020 --> 28:17.620\n which is can you briefly summarize your vision\n\n28:17.620 --> 28:21.020\n how Ethereum 2.0 will make Ethereum more scalable,\n\n28:21.020 --> 28:23.300\n secure and sustainable?\n\n28:23.300 --> 28:27.140\n Sure, so I think recently we've actually been\n\n28:27.140 --> 28:30.660\n kind of deemphasizing the ETH 2.0 branding, I guess.\n\n28:30.660 --> 28:33.620\n So the reason behind that was that originally\n\n28:33.620 --> 28:37.100\n we envisioned something more like a big grand event\n\n28:37.100 --> 28:39.900\n where all the good things would happen at the same time\n\n28:39.900 --> 28:41.860\n and it would be a new blockchain,\n\n28:41.860 --> 28:43.140\n and it would be a new protocol\n\n28:43.140 --> 28:45.260\n and people would have to take a lot of effort\n\n28:45.260 --> 28:46.460\n to migrate over.\n\n28:46.460 --> 28:50.340\n But later we've slowly changed the roadmap\n\n28:50.340 --> 28:53.220\n over to something that's much more incremental, right?\n\n28:53.220 --> 28:56.060\n So proof of stake happens kind of over time\n\n28:56.060 --> 28:57.540\n and then sharding gets added over time\n\n28:57.540 --> 28:59.340\n and all of these features get added over time.\n\n28:59.340 --> 29:02.660\n And so the experience for just a regular Ethereum user\n\n29:02.660 --> 29:04.540\n still feels very seamless, right?\n\n29:04.540 --> 29:06.700\n It's like maybe a little bit more complex\n\n29:06.700 --> 29:09.420\n than the hard forks that we've already done\n\n29:09.420 --> 29:13.140\n from a user's point of view, but not by that much, right?\n\n29:13.140 --> 29:17.900\n So the big two things that are happening, right?\n\n29:17.900 --> 29:19.860\n These are what used to be considered\n\n29:19.860 --> 29:21.860\n the two flagship features of ETH 2.0\n\n29:21.860 --> 29:23.980\n and now they're just the flagship features\n\n29:23.980 --> 29:27.780\n of the next devolution of Ethereum,\n\n29:27.780 --> 29:31.340\n as proof of stake and sharding.\n\n29:31.340 --> 29:34.180\n So proof of stake is a consensus algorithm.\n\n29:34.180 --> 29:38.140\n It's a, or a consensus mechanism, I should say.\n\n29:38.140 --> 29:40.380\n The difference is that like an algorithm\n\n29:40.380 --> 29:41.820\n is something that you run by yourself.\n\n29:41.820 --> 29:45.500\n A mechanism is like interactions between people\n\n29:45.500 --> 29:48.140\n and it could even include incentives and all of that.\n\n29:48.140 --> 29:51.060\n So a consensus mechanism,\n\n29:52.180 --> 29:56.500\n so by which nodes in the network agree on\n\n29:56.500 --> 29:58.580\n which blocks came in, which transactions came in,\n\n29:58.580 --> 30:01.900\n what order, make sure that once a block gets accepted,\n\n30:01.900 --> 30:04.220\n it can't get reverted and all of these things\n\n30:04.220 --> 30:06.220\n that we expect from a blockchain.\n\n30:06.220 --> 30:08.860\n So existing blockchains, including Bitcoin,\n\n30:08.860 --> 30:10.340\n including the Ethereum of today,\n\n30:10.340 --> 30:13.540\n and including a lot of them, they use proof of work, right?\n\n30:13.540 --> 30:17.860\n So the reason why we need proof of anything\n\n30:17.860 --> 30:22.700\n is because they serve this function that I call\n\n30:22.700 --> 30:25.420\n an economic civil resistance.\n\n30:25.420 --> 30:28.660\n So that's obviously a big word for,\n\n30:28.660 --> 30:30.980\n especially if you've never heard of symbols before,\n\n30:30.980 --> 30:32.540\n but like the basic idea is, right,\n\n30:32.540 --> 30:34.580\n that you have a network and you have lots of computers\n\n30:34.580 --> 30:36.900\n that agree on like which blocks to accept.\n\n30:36.900 --> 30:39.340\n And sometimes you get two blocks that get published\n\n30:39.340 --> 30:41.420\n at the same time and you just have to agree on an order.\n\n30:41.420 --> 30:44.220\n So there has to be some kind of voting game.\n\n30:44.220 --> 30:46.820\n But then the question is, well, in this voting game,\n\n30:46.820 --> 30:49.380\n who gets to vote, who gets to participate?\n\n30:49.380 --> 30:52.140\n Now, you can't say one person, one vote, right?\n\n30:52.140 --> 30:54.100\n The reason why you cannot say one person, one vote\n\n30:54.100 --> 30:57.060\n is because you need some kind of like authority\n\n30:57.060 --> 31:00.900\n or some kind of mechanism to say who the humans are.\n\n31:00.900 --> 31:02.940\n And if you don't have that,\n\n31:02.940 --> 31:05.900\n then a bad guy could just come in with a virtual machine\n\n31:05.900 --> 31:08.980\n or with a computer that has on it 10 billion virtual machines\n\n31:08.980 --> 31:11.100\n that have 10 billion virtual nodes.\n\n31:11.100 --> 31:13.860\n And then just like say, look, I'm 99% of the network,\n\n31:13.860 --> 31:15.780\n I should control everything.\n\n31:15.780 --> 31:19.620\n So to prevent this, what proof of work and proof of stake\n\n31:19.620 --> 31:23.180\n both do is they basically say, well, the weight of your vote,\n\n31:23.180 --> 31:27.540\n like how much influence your votes have in the consensus\n\n31:27.540 --> 31:29.980\n is proportional to like what quantity\n\n31:29.980 --> 31:31.780\n of economic resources you bring in.\n\n31:31.780 --> 31:33.380\n So in the case of proof of work,\n\n31:33.380 --> 31:35.340\n you prove what economic resources you have\n\n31:35.340 --> 31:37.460\n because your economic resources are computers\n\n31:37.460 --> 31:38.780\n and you prove that you have them\n\n31:38.780 --> 31:40.420\n by just running them 24 seven\n\n31:40.420 --> 31:42.740\n using these hash algorithms, right?\n\n31:42.740 --> 31:45.020\n So this does solve the problem, right?\n\n31:45.020 --> 31:47.300\n Because in order to attack the network,\n\n31:47.300 --> 31:50.180\n you have to come in with more computers\n\n31:50.180 --> 31:53.300\n and more money invested into computers and electricity\n\n31:53.300 --> 31:55.460\n than the rest of the network puts together.\n\n31:55.460 --> 31:57.380\n And that's extremely expensive.\n\n31:57.380 --> 32:00.420\n In proof of stake, instead of relying on people\n\n32:00.420 --> 32:03.060\n with computers that are just constantly cranking out\n\n32:03.060 --> 32:08.060\n hashes 24 seven, as you're like a unit of economic resources,\n\n32:08.780 --> 32:11.700\n you just use like holdings of coins inside the system, right?\n\n32:11.700 --> 32:12.780\n So all of these blockchains,\n\n32:12.780 --> 32:14.460\n they have some kind of coin in them.\n\n32:14.460 --> 32:17.380\n Bitcoin has Bitcoin, Ethereum has ether,\n\n32:17.380 --> 32:18.260\n they all have a coin.\n\n32:18.260 --> 32:22.940\n So why not just use that as the economic resource\n\n32:22.940 --> 32:25.860\n that you're using to measure participation.\n\n32:25.860 --> 32:29.220\n So that's like the core distinction\n\n32:29.220 --> 32:31.900\n between proof of work and proof of stake.\n\n32:31.900 --> 32:32.940\n I like proof of stake\n\n32:32.940 --> 32:35.380\n and I've liked proof of stake for many years,\n\n32:35.380 --> 32:38.260\n basically because like it just requires\n\n32:38.260 --> 32:41.260\n much less ongoing resource consumption, right?\n\n32:41.260 --> 32:42.820\n Like with proof of work,\n\n32:42.820 --> 32:45.700\n you have to like actually go and buy these physical computers\n\n32:45.700 --> 32:49.180\n and these days, they have specialized hardware,\n\n32:49.180 --> 32:51.940\n ASICs, application specific integrated circuits.\n\n32:51.940 --> 32:54.140\n You have to go produce them and you have to go buy them.\n\n32:54.140 --> 32:56.660\n And unless you have millions of dollars,\n\n32:56.660 --> 32:58.500\n you have to buy them from one of these other people\n\n32:58.500 --> 33:01.300\n who creates them and those other people often end up\n\n33:01.300 --> 33:03.660\n taking a huge cut of the profits themselves.\n\n33:03.660 --> 33:06.860\n And then you have to plug them in,\n\n33:06.860 --> 33:09.820\n you have to just burn all of this electricity\n\n33:09.820 --> 33:11.820\n that's just running 24 seven.\n\n33:11.820 --> 33:14.300\n So it consumes a huge amount of energy, right?\n\n33:14.300 --> 33:17.060\n And not just energy, it also,\n\n33:17.060 --> 33:19.060\n just to create the hardware, right?\n\n33:19.060 --> 33:20.620\n Like people focus a lot on energy,\n\n33:20.620 --> 33:23.500\n but like actually about half the cost of proof of work\n\n33:23.500 --> 33:25.380\n mining is the cost of the hardware.\n\n33:25.380 --> 33:28.060\n So hardware is a very big deal too.\n\n33:28.060 --> 33:32.060\n And you need this really big and powerful,\n\n33:32.060 --> 33:33.340\n very specialized hardware,\n\n33:33.340 --> 33:35.620\n another kind that fills up these big warehouses.\n\n33:35.620 --> 33:36.620\n So proof of stake,\n\n33:36.620 --> 33:38.980\n you don't really need that much electricity,\n\n33:38.980 --> 33:42.980\n you just need just a little bit to run a regular computer.\n\n33:42.980 --> 33:45.340\n You can run proof of stake validators on computers\n\n33:45.340 --> 33:47.220\n that you already have.\n\n33:47.220 --> 33:52.100\n So it's just much less resource intensive.\n\n33:52.100 --> 33:53.900\n And like, this is good for a few reasons, right?\n\n33:53.900 --> 33:55.020\n Like one is, you know,\n\n33:55.020 --> 33:57.380\n the kind of environmental rationale that, you know,\n\n33:57.380 --> 33:59.500\n you're not breaking the environment.\n\n33:59.500 --> 34:03.540\n The second is that you're not taking away electricity\n\n34:03.540 --> 34:06.060\n and like other resources from other people.\n\n34:06.060 --> 34:07.860\n I mean, like right now there's,\n\n34:07.860 --> 34:10.620\n I think just today I saw a story about like Iran\n\n34:10.620 --> 34:12.580\n wanting to shut down some Bitcoin mining\n\n34:12.580 --> 34:15.220\n because it was just grabbing up so much electricity\n\n34:15.220 --> 34:17.300\n that it was, you know, outbidding the nearby towns\n\n34:17.300 --> 34:19.740\n and they just didn't have enough.\n\n34:19.740 --> 34:22.140\n And then there was like Chia,\n\n34:22.140 --> 34:24.700\n the one that's doing proof of like hard disk mining\n\n34:24.700 --> 34:27.060\n basically is just like grabbing up so many hard disks,\n\n34:27.060 --> 34:28.940\n there's a shortage, right?\n\n34:28.940 --> 34:29.900\n So that's the second reason.\n\n34:29.900 --> 34:32.540\n And then the third more selfish reason is that\n\n34:32.540 --> 34:34.660\n because participating in consensus\n\n34:34.660 --> 34:37.580\n does not require so much energy expenditure,\n\n34:37.580 --> 34:40.660\n you don't need to pay people as much to participate, right?\n\n34:40.660 --> 34:42.100\n So like Bitcoin and Ethereum,\n\n34:42.100 --> 34:46.300\n they both issue somewhere around 4% of the total supply\n\n34:46.300 --> 34:48.420\n every year right now to miners.\n\n34:48.420 --> 34:50.820\n So Ethereum is about 4.7 million ether\n\n34:50.820 --> 34:53.500\n and the current supply is about 115 million.\n\n34:53.500 --> 34:54.460\n But with proof of stake,\n\n34:54.460 --> 34:58.380\n like we expect it'll be somewhere between 500,000\n\n34:58.380 --> 35:00.260\n and one million per year.\n\n35:00.260 --> 35:02.900\n So that means, you know,\n\n35:02.900 --> 35:06.860\n the supply doesn't have to increase so quickly.\n\n35:06.860 --> 35:07.700\n So.\n\n35:07.700 --> 35:12.340\n One of the pros that the people sort of argue for the proof\n\n35:12.340 --> 35:14.820\n of work is that it is secure\n\n35:14.820 --> 35:17.820\n because it's much more difficult to sort of,\n\n35:17.820 --> 35:19.980\n as you've highlighted, it's difficult to participate.\n\n35:19.980 --> 35:24.980\n Is there, what are your thoughts about the security\n\n35:25.180 --> 35:28.980\n of the proof of stake mechanism?\n\n35:28.980 --> 35:30.700\n Is there ways to make it secure?\n\n35:30.700 --> 35:32.660\n So I think proof of stake is very secure\n\n35:32.660 --> 35:36.540\n because in order to be able to attack the system,\n\n35:36.540 --> 35:39.220\n you needs to have like basically as much stake\n\n35:39.220 --> 35:41.220\n as the rest of the network, right?\n\n35:41.220 --> 35:43.100\n So that means like right now, for example,\n\n35:43.100 --> 35:44.620\n we have 5 million eth staking.\n\n35:44.620 --> 35:46.260\n So you have to come up with 5 million eth\n\n35:46.260 --> 35:47.620\n and then join the network.\n\n35:47.620 --> 35:51.980\n And then the other, so 5 million eth is a lot, right?\n\n35:51.980 --> 35:53.700\n It's like, how much is it now?\n\n35:53.700 --> 35:55.220\n Like $15 billion.\n\n35:55.220 --> 35:58.260\n So that's actually more than I believe the cost\n\n35:58.260 --> 36:00.420\n of attacking the Bitcoin network.\n\n36:00.420 --> 36:03.020\n And then the second thing is that recovering\n\n36:03.020 --> 36:04.980\n from attacks is much easier in proof of stake\n\n36:04.980 --> 36:05.940\n than in proof of work, right?\n\n36:05.940 --> 36:08.980\n Because in proof of stake, you have, like, first of all,\n\n36:08.980 --> 36:10.660\n we have for many kinds of attacks\n\n36:10.660 --> 36:12.140\n that you do against this network,\n\n36:12.140 --> 36:14.660\n we have this concept of like automatic slashing, right?\n\n36:14.660 --> 36:16.700\n Which basically means that in order\n\n36:16.700 --> 36:19.340\n to like revert a finalized block,\n\n36:19.340 --> 36:22.180\n so if there's one block that's like accepted by the network\n\n36:22.180 --> 36:23.940\n and you try to convince the network\n\n36:23.940 --> 36:26.940\n to kind of revert that block and accept a different block,\n\n36:26.940 --> 36:28.820\n in order to make that kind of attack,\n\n36:28.820 --> 36:31.940\n you basically have to have your validator,\n\n36:31.940 --> 36:33.540\n like a big portion of your validator\n\n36:33.540 --> 36:35.980\n assigned to conflicting messages.\n\n36:35.980 --> 36:38.380\n And this is something that like once these messages\n\n36:38.380 --> 36:39.940\n are on the network, like you can go and prove,\n\n36:39.940 --> 36:41.340\n like, look, these people did it.\n\n36:41.340 --> 36:43.940\n And so we have this feature in the protocol called slashing\n\n36:43.940 --> 36:45.820\n where you basically take all these people\n\n36:45.820 --> 36:48.780\n who provably misbehaved and you burn their coins, right?\n\n36:48.780 --> 36:50.780\n And you don't burn anyone else's coins.\n\n36:50.780 --> 36:53.660\n Now, there are other cases, like for example,\n\n36:53.660 --> 36:55.500\n if instead of reverting blocks,\n\n36:55.500 --> 36:57.740\n the attack just tries to censor everyone, right?\n\n36:57.740 --> 37:01.020\n Then everyone who got censored would just like\n\n37:01.020 --> 37:02.980\n basically create the minority chain\n\n37:02.980 --> 37:05.340\n and then the community would basically\n\n37:05.340 --> 37:06.500\n have to do a soft fork, right?\n\n37:06.500 --> 37:07.460\n They would just have to say like,\n\n37:07.460 --> 37:09.060\n look, this chain is clearly attacking us,\n\n37:09.060 --> 37:10.780\n this chain is the one not attacking us,\n\n37:10.780 --> 37:12.340\n and so we're gonna join this chain.\n\n37:12.340 --> 37:15.140\n And then what happens is that on that new chain,\n\n37:15.140 --> 37:17.580\n the attackers also lose a lot of coins, right?\n\n37:17.580 --> 37:20.660\n So the difference between proof of stake and proof of work\n\n37:20.660 --> 37:22.260\n is that in a proof of stake system,\n\n37:22.260 --> 37:24.660\n like you can identify specific participants\n\n37:24.660 --> 37:26.540\n and you can say, you know, these,\n\n37:26.540 --> 37:27.980\n and like this isn't like, you know,\n\n37:27.980 --> 37:29.620\n a human going in and saying, I don't like you,\n\n37:29.620 --> 37:30.580\n I don't like you, I don't like you,\n\n37:30.580 --> 37:32.300\n this is like automated, right?\n\n37:32.300 --> 37:34.660\n So the slashing process is automated.\n\n37:34.660 --> 37:35.500\n Yes.\n\n37:35.500 --> 37:37.420\n Is there ways it can go wrong?\n\n37:37.420 --> 37:40.260\n So that's a painful process where the coins are burned.\n\n37:41.300 --> 37:42.540\n It is painful, yes.\n\n37:42.540 --> 37:45.940\n I think, I mean, the one big unknown, of course,\n\n37:45.940 --> 37:48.540\n is like if an attack actually happens\n\n37:48.540 --> 37:51.340\n and like if an attack happens that requires the community\n\n37:51.340 --> 37:53.780\n to actually choose one of these minority forks,\n\n37:53.780 --> 37:57.120\n then like what would the community\n\n37:57.120 --> 37:59.980\n actually successfully coordinating on this look like, right?\n\n37:59.980 --> 38:03.220\n Like it's like, you know, we can talk about it\n\n38:03.220 --> 38:05.940\n and we can, you know, write like science fiction novels\n\n38:05.940 --> 38:07.900\n about it, but like until it's happened,\n\n38:07.900 --> 38:09.980\n you don't really know the details of like what it looks like\n\n38:09.980 --> 38:11.020\n and how difficult it is.\n\n38:11.020 --> 38:13.540\n What are the channels of communication for the community?\n\n38:13.540 --> 38:18.020\n If you can enlighten me a little bit, like what, you know,\n\n38:18.020 --> 38:19.980\n in many ways in the political realm,\n\n38:19.980 --> 38:22.540\n Twitter is often used as a way to kind of have\n\n38:22.540 --> 38:25.400\n these emerging phenomena of large groups of people\n\n38:25.400 --> 38:28.300\n coming to a consensus about a particular idea.\n\n38:28.300 --> 38:30.340\n And then there's battle for consensus.\n\n38:30.340 --> 38:35.140\n What's in the Ethereum community, how do people,\n\n38:35.140 --> 38:39.380\n what are the sources of natural language based communication\n\n38:39.380 --> 38:42.980\n that have an emergent belief structure that you would say?\n\n38:43.940 --> 38:45.340\n Or is it all through money?\n\n38:45.340 --> 38:48.100\n Is it all through trading that the communication happens?\n\n38:48.100 --> 38:50.140\n There's definitely talking as well.\n\n38:50.140 --> 38:53.420\n I mean, like we have to agree on protocol changes somehow,\n\n38:53.420 --> 38:55.380\n right, like there's Twitter, there's Reddit,\n\n38:55.380 --> 39:00.380\n there's GitHub, there's all of the various Ethereum forums,\n\n39:00.500 --> 39:02.780\n Ethereum magicians, Ethereum research.\n\n39:02.780 --> 39:05.020\n There's just in person communication.\n\n39:05.020 --> 39:06.860\n Then there's just kind of like the hidden web\n\n39:06.860 --> 39:11.220\n of everyone talking to everyone on Telegram or Signal.\n\n39:11.220 --> 39:14.020\n So it's like some of everything, right?\n\n39:14.020 --> 39:17.540\n But I think like the thing to emphasize around like,\n\n39:17.540 --> 39:19.660\n can you actually come to consensus on, you know,\n\n39:19.660 --> 39:21.500\n whether or not to fork the chain\n\n39:21.500 --> 39:23.520\n because the attacker is censoring everyone,\n\n39:23.520 --> 39:27.820\n just for example, is like everyone who's running a node\n\n39:27.820 --> 39:30.380\n is going to see almost the same thing, right?\n\n39:30.380 --> 39:32.440\n Like they're gonna be off by a few seconds\n\n39:32.440 --> 39:34.140\n and like maybe they'll be off by a few minutes,\n\n39:34.140 --> 39:35.460\n they'll disagree by a few minutes.\n\n39:35.460 --> 39:37.680\n But like if it's a serious attack, you know,\n\n39:37.680 --> 39:38.780\n people are gonna know, right?\n\n39:38.780 --> 39:40.900\n It's not like one of those things where, you know,\n\n39:40.900 --> 39:43.900\n oh, we're trying to agree on like, I don't know,\n\n39:43.900 --> 39:48.100\n did Epstein kill himself or like some random political fact\n\n39:48.100 --> 39:50.060\n where like in reality, no one knows a single thing\n\n39:50.060 --> 39:52.580\n about what's actually going on and they're all speculating.\n\n39:52.580 --> 39:54.340\n Like it is much more visible, right?\n\n39:54.340 --> 39:57.300\n So we do have that, but you know, at the same time,\n\n39:57.300 --> 39:59.160\n I'm happy to admit that like,\n\n39:59.160 --> 40:02.080\n these are fairly untested mechanisms,\n\n40:02.080 --> 40:03.340\n but like at the same time,\n\n40:03.340 --> 40:05.820\n they're also untested mechanisms in Proof of Work, right?\n\n40:05.820 --> 40:07.460\n And like in Proof of Work, it's even harder\n\n40:07.460 --> 40:09.940\n because in Proof of Work, you don't have the ability\n\n40:09.940 --> 40:12.260\n to like identify and say, like, you know,\n\n40:12.260 --> 40:14.300\n I'm going to these miners attacked\n\n40:14.300 --> 40:17.180\n and so we're not gonna let these miners in,\n\n40:17.180 --> 40:20.220\n these miners did not attack, so we're gonna keep them in.\n\n40:20.220 --> 40:21.500\n Like you have to pretty much, you know,\n\n40:21.500 --> 40:23.740\n either take out none of the miners\n\n40:23.740 --> 40:26.460\n or you do a fork that changes the Proof of Work algorithm\n\n40:26.460 --> 40:28.020\n which takes out all of the miners, right?\n\n40:28.020 --> 40:32.140\n So the economics of like recovering from attacks\n\n40:32.140 --> 40:33.540\n in Proof of Work, at least to me,\n\n40:33.540 --> 40:36.960\n actually do seem like more unfavorable,\n\n40:36.960 --> 40:39.740\n but you know, I'm sure the Proof of Work people you talk to\n\n40:39.740 --> 40:42.460\n will give a very different and contradictory opinions\n\n40:42.460 --> 40:44.620\n and that's totally fine and amazing.\n\n40:44.620 --> 40:48.740\n Some people describe MEV, minor extractable value,\n\n40:48.740 --> 40:51.680\n as an existential risk to Ethereum.\n\n40:51.680 --> 40:52.820\n What is MEV?\n\n40:52.820 --> 40:55.020\n How important is it to solve MEV?\n\n40:55.020 --> 40:57.180\n If it's important, what ideas do you have?\n\n40:57.180 --> 40:58.760\n Sure, how about after this one,\n\n40:58.760 --> 41:01.060\n we'll also talk about sharding because it's amazing\n\n41:01.060 --> 41:01.900\n and it's part of you too.\n\n41:01.900 --> 41:03.660\n Yes, we'll return back to sharding\n\n41:03.660 --> 41:06.060\n which is, we'll return to the big picture\n\n41:06.060 --> 41:07.980\n of the scaling problem as you mentioned.\n\n41:07.980 --> 41:09.740\n I love this conversation, you know,\n\n41:09.740 --> 41:11.740\n depth first search instead of breadth first.\n\n41:11.740 --> 41:16.740\n So basically, okay, MEV, minor extractable value,\n\n41:16.740 --> 41:19.160\n it is not different in Proof of Work and Proof of Stake,\n\n41:19.160 --> 41:21.120\n right, so like if you want to call it, you know,\n\n41:21.120 --> 41:22.880\n block proposer extractable value,\n\n41:22.880 --> 41:24.280\n like it sounds a lot sexy, but you know,\n\n41:24.280 --> 41:27.360\n we can call it BPEV instead of MEV, who cares?\n\n41:27.360 --> 41:30.040\n So this is a problem in both Proof of Work\n\n41:30.040 --> 41:30.880\n and Proof of Stake?\n\n41:30.880 --> 41:35.880\n Yes, so the basic idea is that if you have the ability\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:39.800\n to choose which transactions go into a block\n\n41:39.800 --> 41:42.720\n and in what order, then you have the ability\n\n41:42.720 --> 41:45.720\n to like take advantage of that position for economic gain\n\n41:45.720 --> 41:48.000\n and for economic gain in a lot more ways\n\n41:48.000 --> 41:50.080\n than just collecting transaction fees, right?\n\n41:50.080 --> 41:52.880\n Like for example, there's decentralized exchanges on chain\n\n41:52.880 --> 41:56.020\n like Uniswap and like let's say the price\n\n41:56.020 --> 42:01.020\n of ETH versus USDC was 2,700 the previous block,\n\n42:01.960 --> 42:03.480\n but then there was a bit of a market drop\n\n42:03.480 --> 42:05.960\n and now it's 2,680 where you can go on Uniswap\n\n42:05.960 --> 42:09.060\n and you can just like gobble up the entire part of,\n\n42:09.060 --> 42:10.960\n you know, the automated order book\n\n42:10.960 --> 42:13.520\n that's like between 2,700 and 2,680, right?\n\n42:13.520 --> 42:16.640\n And that's, and then at the same time, you like run a bot\n\n42:16.640 --> 42:19.480\n and you know, you buy some ETH back at 2,680\n\n42:19.480 --> 42:21.760\n and you've just like made about $10 of profit, right?\n\n42:21.760 --> 42:25.120\n So, or well, $10 times, you know, whatever the depth is.\n\n42:25.120 --> 42:28.520\n Right, so there's lots of little things like that.\n\n42:28.520 --> 42:31.560\n There's also things that involve like front running\n\n42:31.560 --> 42:33.240\n other people's transactions.\n\n42:33.240 --> 42:37.060\n So one example of this would be that if someone sends\n\n42:37.060 --> 42:39.920\n a transaction that says, I don't know,\n\n42:39.920 --> 42:44.920\n buy me five ETH for whatever price that you can get,\n\n42:45.760 --> 42:50.760\n then, but with a maximum of, let's say $15,000,\n\n42:50.920 --> 42:53.680\n then you can go and like, you can send each,\n\n42:53.680 --> 42:55.800\n put a transaction right in front of that transaction\n\n42:55.800 --> 42:57.600\n and you can like buy up that ETH first\n\n42:57.600 --> 42:59.120\n and then you resell it to him at, you know,\n\n42:59.120 --> 43:00.920\n $15,000 minus one, you know?\n\n43:00.920 --> 43:02.480\n So there's.\n\n43:02.480 --> 43:03.880\n Then you get to make a little bit of money that way.\n\n43:03.880 --> 43:05.600\n Exactly, so there's a lot of these different\n\n43:05.600 --> 43:07.360\n like arbitrage, front running, back running,\n\n43:07.360 --> 43:11.120\n these different tricks that allow block proposers to.\n\n43:11.120 --> 43:13.560\n To get some percentage on top, like overhead.\n\n43:13.560 --> 43:17.480\n Exactly, and the reason why this is a challenge\n\n43:17.480 --> 43:21.680\n is because it's, I mean, like first of all,\n\n43:21.680 --> 43:24.340\n it sometimes degrades user experience\n\n43:24.340 --> 43:27.440\n because users get no less favorable trades,\n\n43:27.440 --> 43:30.560\n but there are sometimes ways to like mitigate that\n\n43:30.560 --> 43:32.960\n for applications, sometimes it's not that bad,\n\n43:32.960 --> 43:35.800\n but like the bigger risk that I think some people consider\n\n43:35.800 --> 43:38.960\n more existential is that there's just much more\n\n43:38.960 --> 43:41.080\n economies of scale in figuring out\n\n43:41.080 --> 43:43.020\n how to extract all this revenue, right?\n\n43:43.020 --> 43:45.200\n Because if you're just collecting transaction fees,\n\n43:45.200 --> 43:47.400\n there aren't really economies of scale,\n\n43:47.400 --> 43:49.240\n there aren't really benefits to centralizing, right?\n\n43:49.240 --> 43:50.600\n Because it's a very simple formula,\n\n43:50.600 --> 43:53.320\n you just like grab up the transactions that pay you the most.\n\n43:53.320 --> 43:57.760\n But with MEV, there's all these sophisticated algorithms\n\n43:57.760 --> 43:59.940\n and if you have lots of money,\n\n43:59.940 --> 44:01.400\n then you can hire really smart people\n\n44:01.400 --> 44:03.160\n to make amazing algorithms and then you can use\n\n44:03.160 --> 44:06.080\n the other half of your money to get a lot of mining power\n\n44:06.080 --> 44:08.160\n or a lot of stake and you get a lot of opportunities\n\n44:08.160 --> 44:09.940\n to use your even better algorithms.\n\n44:09.940 --> 44:14.480\n So there's this risk that like as a result of this,\n\n44:14.480 --> 44:18.600\n mining is basically, or even validating proof of stake\n\n44:18.600 --> 44:19.760\n is going to centralize.\n\n44:20.860 --> 44:23.920\n So I think the ecosystem is best replied\n\n44:23.920 --> 44:25.840\n to this sort of risk and it's the direction\n\n44:25.840 --> 44:28.880\n where projects like Flashbots are going already\n\n44:28.880 --> 44:33.500\n is if you can't eliminate the centralization,\n\n44:33.500 --> 44:35.200\n then you try to firewall it, right?\n\n44:35.200 --> 44:39.080\n And the way that you firewall it is you basically say,\n\n44:39.080 --> 44:42.000\n we're going to try to deliberately create a marketplace\n\n44:42.000 --> 44:45.320\n where people can just do the complicated work\n\n44:45.320 --> 44:47.080\n of creating what are called bundles,\n\n44:47.080 --> 44:51.880\n like bundles of transactions that are very profitable, right?\n\n44:51.880 --> 44:54.200\n And then at the other side of the market,\n\n44:54.200 --> 44:56.600\n you just have like block proposes reminders\n\n44:56.600 --> 44:57.760\n that are just dumb notes.\n\n44:57.760 --> 45:00.840\n And they go and ask the what are called searchers,\n\n45:00.840 --> 45:02.800\n the bundle creators, and they just ask like,\n\n45:02.800 --> 45:05.560\n hey, like how much can you give me if I put in your bundle?\n\n45:05.560 --> 45:07.560\n And then they just take the highest offer, right?\n\n45:07.560 --> 45:09.360\n So you sort of separate out the task\n\n45:09.360 --> 45:12.640\n and you have the easy part and then you have the hard part\n\n45:12.640 --> 45:14.580\n and you have like this special class of actor\n\n45:14.580 --> 45:16.080\n called a searcher that does the hard part\n\n45:16.080 --> 45:19.440\n and then the easy part, the people doing the easy part,\n\n45:19.440 --> 45:20.720\n which is just miners and validators,\n\n45:20.720 --> 45:24.540\n they kind of just talk to all the different people\n\n45:24.540 --> 45:27.720\n doing the searching and they just accept the highest bidder.\n\n45:27.720 --> 45:32.720\n So this is also just like an interesting example\n\n45:33.160 --> 45:35.240\n of like economic design philosophy, right?\n\n45:35.240 --> 45:38.320\n Like sometimes you can't just like make centralization\n\n45:38.320 --> 45:39.860\n go away, sometimes it's inevitable,\n\n45:39.860 --> 45:43.200\n but no, at least you can try to kind of contain it,\n\n45:43.200 --> 45:47.340\n you can direct it or you can even sort of firewall it away\n\n45:47.340 --> 45:49.280\n from core consensus,\n\n45:49.280 --> 45:51.960\n the parts that really do need to be decentralized.\n\n45:51.960 --> 45:53.760\n But you don't see it as an existential risk,\n\n45:53.760 --> 45:56.280\n it's just a bit of a problem\n\n45:56.280 --> 45:57.960\n that it has to be constantly dealt with.\n\n45:57.960 --> 46:00.960\n It's a risk, like there's obviously a risk\n\n46:00.960 --> 46:04.080\n that it's a very severe problem\n\n46:04.080 --> 46:06.040\n and that even this flash bots approach\n\n46:06.040 --> 46:08.120\n has some fatal flaw or whatever.\n\n46:08.120 --> 46:12.080\n But we're definitely approaching it\n\n46:12.080 --> 46:14.340\n with the mindset of this is a problem\n\n46:14.340 --> 46:16.400\n and like, yes, we do have to do some work to solve it,\n\n46:16.400 --> 46:20.220\n but we're doing it and so far it's being solved.\n\n46:20.220 --> 46:23.360\n Okay, let's talk about the other really, really fascinating\n\n46:23.360 --> 46:26.720\n part of the future of Ethereum.\n\n46:26.720 --> 46:28.880\n Let's not call it Ethereum 2.0,\n\n46:28.880 --> 46:30.440\n but the future of Ethereum\n\n46:30.440 --> 46:32.580\n that also may require a hard fork,\n\n46:32.580 --> 46:34.920\n I don't know, you can correct me on this,\n\n46:34.920 --> 46:39.640\n is well, broadly ideas for scaling.\n\n46:39.640 --> 46:40.480\n Yes.\n\n46:40.480 --> 46:44.000\n And more specifically sort of layer two\n\n46:44.000 --> 46:48.440\n or layer one and two intersection ideas\n\n46:48.440 --> 46:50.000\n of how to achieve scaling.\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.680\n And at the core of that is the idea of sharding.\n\n46:52.680 --> 46:55.240\n So first, what is sharding?\n\n46:55.240 --> 46:59.720\n Okay, so there's two major paradigms\n\n46:59.720 --> 47:01.000\n for scaling blockchains, right?\n\n47:01.000 --> 47:03.000\n As you said, layer one and layer two.\n\n47:03.000 --> 47:05.160\n And layer one basically means\n\n47:05.160 --> 47:07.940\n make the blockchain itself capable\n\n47:07.940 --> 47:09.840\n of processing more transactions\n\n47:09.840 --> 47:13.600\n by having some mechanism by which it can do that\n\n47:13.600 --> 47:15.600\n despite the fact that there's a limit\n\n47:15.600 --> 47:18.040\n to the capacity of each participant in the blockchain.\n\n47:18.040 --> 47:19.080\n And then layer two says,\n\n47:19.080 --> 47:21.300\n well, we're gonna keep the blockchain as is,\n\n47:21.300 --> 47:23.840\n but we're gonna create clever protocols\n\n47:23.840 --> 47:25.500\n that sit on top of the blockchain\n\n47:25.500 --> 47:26.920\n that still use the blockchain\n\n47:26.920 --> 47:28.720\n and then still kind of inherit things\n\n47:28.720 --> 47:31.000\n like the security guarantees of a blockchain.\n\n47:31.000 --> 47:33.840\n But at the same time, a lot of things are done off chain.\n\n47:33.840 --> 47:36.660\n And so you get more scalability that way.\n\n47:36.660 --> 47:39.720\n So in Ethereum, the most popular paradigm\n\n47:39.720 --> 47:40.920\n for layer two is rollups\n\n47:40.920 --> 47:43.280\n and the most popular paradigm for layer one is sharding.\n\n47:43.280 --> 47:46.240\n So one way to achieve layer one scaling\n\n47:46.240 --> 47:48.080\n is to increase the block size.\n\n47:48.080 --> 47:48.920\n Yes.\n\n47:48.920 --> 47:51.880\n Block size wars, quote, unquote.\n\n47:51.880 --> 47:54.220\n And you actually tweeted something about,\n\n47:55.800 --> 47:58.520\n people are saying that Vitalik changed his mind about,\n\n47:58.520 --> 48:03.520\n he went from being a small blocker to a big to small.\n\n48:05.880 --> 48:09.320\n But you said, I've been a medium blocker all along.\n\n48:09.320 --> 48:11.760\n So maybe you can also comment on where,\n\n48:11.760 --> 48:14.840\n on the very basic aspect before we even get to sharding\n\n48:14.840 --> 48:17.400\n of where you stand on this block size debate.\n\n48:17.400 --> 48:18.240\n Sure.\n\n48:18.240 --> 48:20.080\n So the way that I think about the trade off\n\n48:20.080 --> 48:21.580\n is I think about it as a trade off\n\n48:21.580 --> 48:24.200\n between making it easy to write to the blockchain\n\n48:24.200 --> 48:26.440\n and making it easy to read the blockchain.\n\n48:26.440 --> 48:28.480\n So when I say read, I just mean,\n\n48:28.480 --> 48:30.160\n have a node and actually verify it\n\n48:30.160 --> 48:32.280\n and make sure that it's correct and all of those things.\n\n48:32.280 --> 48:34.680\n And then by write, I mean send transactions.\n\n48:34.680 --> 48:37.240\n So I think for decentralization,\n\n48:37.240 --> 48:40.220\n it's important for both of these tasks to be accessible.\n\n48:40.220 --> 48:43.040\n And I think that they're about equally importance.\n\n48:43.040 --> 48:45.120\n If you have a chain that's too expensive to read,\n\n48:45.120 --> 48:46.800\n then everyone will just trust a few people\n\n48:46.800 --> 48:48.360\n to read for them.\n\n48:48.360 --> 48:49.920\n And then those people can change the rules\n\n48:49.920 --> 48:51.680\n without anyone else's permission.\n\n48:51.680 --> 48:53.360\n But if on the other hand,\n\n48:53.360 --> 48:55.200\n it becomes really expensive to write,\n\n48:55.200 --> 48:58.680\n then everyone will move on to basically\n\n48:58.680 --> 49:01.640\n second layer systems that are incredibly centralized.\n\n49:01.640 --> 49:04.660\n And that takes away from decentralization\n\n49:04.660 --> 49:06.380\n and self sovereignty as well.\n\n49:06.380 --> 49:08.280\n So this has been my viewpoints\n\n49:08.280 --> 49:09.440\n pretty much the whole time, right?\n\n49:09.440 --> 49:11.000\n It's like, you need this balance\n\n49:11.000 --> 49:12.760\n and going in one direction or the other direction\n\n49:12.760 --> 49:14.340\n is very unhealthy.\n\n49:14.340 --> 49:16.680\n In the Bitcoin case, basically what happened\n\n49:16.680 --> 49:19.720\n was that Bitcoin originally,\n\n49:19.720 --> 49:22.100\n at the very beginning, it didn't really have a block size.\n\n49:22.100 --> 49:25.040\n It just had an accidental block size of 32 meg,\n\n49:25.040 --> 49:27.200\n or block size limit of 32 megabytes\n\n49:27.200 --> 49:29.360\n because that just happens to be the limit\n\n49:29.360 --> 49:31.360\n of the peer to peer messages.\n\n49:31.360 --> 49:32.200\n But then...\n\n49:32.200 --> 49:33.580\n Interesting, I didn't even know that part.\n\n49:33.580 --> 49:36.800\n Yeah, but then Satoshi back in 2010\n\n49:36.800 --> 49:38.760\n was worried that even 32 megabyte blocks\n\n49:38.760 --> 49:39.880\n would be too hard to process.\n\n49:39.880 --> 49:42.600\n So he put the limit down to one megabyte.\n\n49:42.600 --> 49:44.920\n And I think the...\n\n49:44.920 --> 49:47.240\n I put, you mean sneaked in there.\n\n49:47.240 --> 49:49.960\n Yeah, just like made an update to the Bitcoin software\n\n49:49.960 --> 49:51.480\n that made blocks bigger than one,\n\n49:51.480 --> 49:54.240\n I think it's a million bytes invalid.\n\n49:54.240 --> 49:58.420\n And I think the impression that most people had at the time\n\n49:58.420 --> 50:01.380\n is that this is just a temporary safety measure.\n\n50:01.380 --> 50:05.880\n And over time, as we become more confident in the software,\n\n50:05.880 --> 50:10.760\n that limit would be raised somewhat.\n\n50:10.760 --> 50:15.760\n But then when the actual usage of the blockchain\n\n50:16.320 --> 50:19.000\n started going up, and then it started going up\n\n50:19.000 --> 50:21.200\n first to 100 kilobytes per block,\n\n50:21.200 --> 50:22.640\n then to 250 kilobytes per block,\n\n50:22.640 --> 50:25.080\n then to 500 kilobytes per block,\n\n50:25.080 --> 50:28.480\n there started coming out of the woodworks this opinion\n\n50:28.480 --> 50:31.120\n that no, that limit should just not be increased.\n\n50:31.120 --> 50:36.120\n And then there are all of these attempts at compromising.\n\n50:36.120 --> 50:40.960\n First, there was a proposal for 20 megabyte blocks.\n\n50:40.960 --> 50:43.120\n Then there was the 248 proposal,\n\n50:43.120 --> 50:46.180\n which is a bit ironic because the 248 proposal\n\n50:46.180 --> 50:49.480\n started off being a small block negotiating position.\n\n50:49.480 --> 50:52.040\n But then when the big block people came back and said,\n\n50:52.040 --> 50:53.680\n hey, aren't we gonna do this?\n\n50:53.680 --> 50:55.040\n They're like, oh, no, no, no, we don't want them.\n\n50:55.040 --> 50:57.920\n We don't want the block size increases anymore.\n\n50:57.920 --> 51:01.600\n So there were these two different positions,\n\n51:01.600 --> 51:02.680\n the small blockers.\n\n51:02.680 --> 51:06.080\n I think they valued one megabyte blocks for two reasons.\n\n51:06.080 --> 51:08.360\n One is that they just really, really believe\n\n51:08.360 --> 51:10.980\n in the importance of being able to read the chain.\n\n51:10.980 --> 51:14.360\n But two is that a lot of them really believe\n\n51:14.360 --> 51:18.560\n in maintaining this norm of never hard forking, right?\n\n51:18.560 --> 51:21.200\n So the difference between a hard fork and a soft fork\n\n51:21.200 --> 51:24.000\n is basically that in a soft fork,\n\n51:26.360 --> 51:28.240\n any block that's valid under the new rules\n\n51:28.240 --> 51:30.040\n was still valid under the old rules.\n\n51:30.040 --> 51:31.740\n So if you have a client that verifies\n\n51:31.740 --> 51:33.000\n according to the old rules,\n\n51:33.000 --> 51:35.440\n then you'll still be able to accept the chain\n\n51:35.440 --> 51:37.360\n that follows the new rules.\n\n51:37.360 --> 51:38.720\n Whereas with a hard fork,\n\n51:38.720 --> 51:42.140\n you have to update your code in order to stay on the chain.\n\n51:43.160 --> 51:48.080\n And look, they have this belief that soft forks\n\n51:48.080 --> 51:51.040\n are kind of either less coercive than hard forks,\n\n51:51.040 --> 51:53.400\n which by the way, I completely disagree with.\n\n51:53.400 --> 51:55.320\n I actually think soft forks are more coercive\n\n51:55.320 --> 51:57.720\n because basically they force everyone who disagrees\n\n51:57.720 --> 51:59.320\n to sort of go along by default.\n\n51:59.320 --> 52:04.320\n But, or they have this opinion that there's like,\n\n52:06.760 --> 52:09.680\n it's more difficult to abuse soft forks\n\n52:09.680 --> 52:11.040\n to do really mean things like,\n\n52:11.040 --> 52:13.560\n or that like completely violate people's expectations,\n\n52:13.560 --> 52:16.240\n like increasing the supply, which is like,\n\n52:16.240 --> 52:18.840\n I think there is some truth to that.\n\n52:18.840 --> 52:20.560\n So because of these reasons,\n\n52:20.560 --> 52:22.440\n they just say we're only going to do soft forks\n\n52:22.440 --> 52:25.500\n and we want to just not do any hard forks.\n\n52:25.500 --> 52:27.880\n And they eventually discovered this idea\n\n52:27.880 --> 52:29.720\n called segregated witness that allows for like\n\n52:29.720 --> 52:31.880\n a very tiny block size increase\n\n52:31.880 --> 52:34.880\n to like the equivalent of about two megabytes\n\n52:34.880 --> 52:36.160\n with a soft fork.\n\n52:36.160 --> 52:41.160\n It's this really like weird and devious trick.\n\n52:41.840 --> 52:45.080\n Like basically what they do is they take the signatures\n\n52:45.080 --> 52:48.160\n of transactions and then they put them outside of the block.\n\n52:48.160 --> 52:51.240\n And then they add an extra rule that says that like every,\n\n52:51.240 --> 52:52.400\n for a block to be valid,\n\n52:52.400 --> 52:54.440\n the block has to come with a separate,\n\n52:54.440 --> 52:56.000\n like basically extension block\n\n52:56.000 --> 52:58.840\n that contains all of the transaction signatures, right?\n\n52:58.840 --> 53:01.140\n So when you measure it, according to the old rules,\n\n53:01.140 --> 53:02.840\n like, hey, it adds up to less than a million,\n\n53:02.840 --> 53:04.500\n but actually there's this extension block\n\n53:04.500 --> 53:06.960\n that the old protocol doesn't even know about.\n\n53:06.960 --> 53:07.800\n So.\n\n53:07.800 --> 53:10.600\n It's a hack that seemed to work to in a small way\n\n53:10.600 --> 53:12.200\n extend the size of the block size.\n\n53:12.200 --> 53:14.560\n So the small block side was like happy\n\n53:14.560 --> 53:16.120\n with these very low levels of block size.\n\n53:16.120 --> 53:19.360\n And then the big block side wanted to expand to,\n\n53:19.360 --> 53:21.080\n at the very least go to four megabytes,\n\n53:21.080 --> 53:23.280\n then maybe go maybe eight, 20.\n\n53:23.280 --> 53:26.520\n There's disagreements within there as well.\n\n53:26.520 --> 53:29.960\n I definitely was favoring the big side\n\n53:29.960 --> 53:33.960\n the whole way through, as you can probably tell, but.\n\n53:33.960 --> 53:36.960\n Even though, so the argument against the big\n\n53:36.960 --> 53:40.920\n is that it makes things more centralized.\n\n53:40.920 --> 53:43.080\n Yes, because fewer people can run a note\n\n53:43.080 --> 53:44.280\n that verifies the chain.\n\n53:44.280 --> 53:46.200\n And also because any of these things\n\n53:46.200 --> 53:47.320\n would require a hard fork\n\n53:47.320 --> 53:49.320\n and hard forks are inherently risky.\n\n53:49.320 --> 53:51.800\n Do you think there's truth to that?\n\n53:51.800 --> 53:52.760\n I'm pro hard fork.\n\n53:52.760 --> 53:54.720\n I think hard forks are actually like\n\n53:54.720 --> 53:57.440\n in a political economic sense,\n\n53:57.440 --> 53:59.240\n they're better than soft forks.\n\n53:59.240 --> 54:00.760\n Well, let's, okay, okay.\n\n54:00.760 --> 54:05.020\n I think that's a beautiful principle as stated\n\n54:05.020 --> 54:10.020\n that soft forks may be more coercive than hard forks.\n\n54:10.680 --> 54:13.040\n This is not just about cryptocurrency.\n\n54:13.040 --> 54:16.280\n This is about politics and life.\n\n54:16.280 --> 54:17.100\n That's fascinating.\n\n54:17.100 --> 54:20.320\n So you're okay with hard forks.\n\n54:20.320 --> 54:23.480\n In fact, you think hard forks is the right way\n\n54:23.480 --> 54:26.320\n to make changes because then everybody's forced\n\n54:26.320 --> 54:27.720\n to make a decision.\n\n54:27.720 --> 54:29.100\n Do you accept this change or not\n\n54:29.100 --> 54:32.480\n as opposed to ideas being sneaked in behind the door\n\n54:32.480 --> 54:34.840\n and that decision is forced on you?\n\n54:34.840 --> 54:36.140\n Exactly, yeah.\n\n54:36.140 --> 54:39.760\n Okay, so, but hard forks, some people say,\n\n54:39.760 --> 54:42.240\n this is when they talk about sort of Ethereum,\n\n54:42.240 --> 54:44.120\n is there's some aspect to a hard fork\n\n54:44.120 --> 54:46.860\n where you're trying to upgrade a,\n\n54:46.860 --> 54:49.440\n what is it, airplane while it's flying.\n\n54:49.440 --> 54:50.760\n And.\n\n54:50.760 --> 54:52.800\n I think soft forks are also upgrading an airplane\n\n54:52.800 --> 54:53.640\n while it's flying.\n\n54:53.640 --> 54:55.240\n But it's a smaller upgrades.\n\n54:56.200 --> 54:58.680\n That's, there's some truth to that.\n\n54:58.680 --> 55:03.680\n Like there's definitely a bit more risk of like a split\n\n55:03.920 --> 55:07.200\n as a result of a hard fork than as a result of a soft fork.\n\n55:07.200 --> 55:10.620\n And the split is highly undesirable, right?\n\n55:10.620 --> 55:11.460\n Well, it depends.\n\n55:11.460 --> 55:14.160\n Like if it's a split because of a bug, then that's horrible.\n\n55:14.160 --> 55:16.680\n If it's a split as a result of political differences,\n\n55:16.680 --> 55:19.760\n then I think like a split is better than, you know,\n\n55:19.760 --> 55:23.240\n one side being forced to basically just like suck it up\n\n55:23.240 --> 55:26.240\n and accept the majority position even if it really hates it.\n\n55:27.200 --> 55:28.800\n Well, there's also political connections\n\n55:28.800 --> 55:30.400\n throughout the history of the United States.\n\n55:30.400 --> 55:33.120\n It's like sometimes groups of people\n\n55:33.120 --> 55:35.680\n that strongly disagree with each other\n\n55:35.680 --> 55:38.840\n should be forced to work it out.\n\n55:38.840 --> 55:41.560\n Even if they, even when a split seems like an easy thing\n\n55:41.560 --> 55:42.640\n in the short term.\n\n55:42.640 --> 55:43.480\n It depends.\n\n55:43.480 --> 55:46.000\n And I think like, well, for blockchains in particular,\n\n55:46.000 --> 55:50.080\n the costs of people being able to like peacefully do their,\n\n55:50.080 --> 55:52.280\n go off and do their own thing are much lower, right?\n\n55:52.280 --> 55:54.240\n Like, you know, okay, if you have a country\n\n55:54.240 --> 55:58.400\n and you have two groups, then like often enough,\n\n55:58.400 --> 56:01.160\n like fighting out the new rules requires, you know,\n\n56:01.160 --> 56:03.120\n a civil war requires everyone to move and so forth.\n\n56:03.120 --> 56:05.040\n But no, on a blockchain, like, you know,\n\n56:05.040 --> 56:06.740\n the costs are lower and so.\n\n56:07.640 --> 56:09.880\n So if you were to look at the way things worked out\n\n56:09.880 --> 56:13.000\n with the block size wars and there was a split,\n\n56:13.000 --> 56:15.560\n what is it, Bitcoin Cash and all this?\n\n56:15.560 --> 56:16.380\n In Bitcoin.\n\n56:16.380 --> 56:17.220\n Yeah.\n\n56:17.220 --> 56:21.640\n Would you, like you looking, putting on your historian hat,\n\n56:21.640 --> 56:23.980\n you mentioned offline you like Dan Carlin.\n\n56:23.980 --> 56:26.460\n So if Dan Carlin wanted to do an episode\n\n56:26.460 --> 56:31.460\n on the block size wars, do you think it could've turned out\n\n56:32.480 --> 56:36.140\n better or do you, are you okay with the way it turned out?\n\n56:37.680 --> 56:40.860\n I'm definitely disappointed with what happens\n\n56:40.860 --> 56:43.140\n with the block, with the big block side.\n\n56:44.200 --> 56:46.960\n I think the source of my disappointment is that like,\n\n56:46.960 --> 56:50.120\n one of the things that you notice when just looking at\n\n56:50.120 --> 56:52.560\n like this political disagreements generally,\n\n56:52.560 --> 56:55.440\n especially when you have environments where, you know,\n\n56:55.440 --> 56:57.920\n they're authoritarian or like single party dominated\n\n56:57.920 --> 57:00.280\n and then there's some opposition party\n\n57:00.280 --> 57:03.420\n and the opposition often has like very legitimate grievances.\n\n57:03.420 --> 57:05.680\n But at the same time, the thing you notice is that often\n\n57:05.680 --> 57:07.200\n enough the opposition just sucks, right?\n\n57:07.200 --> 57:10.280\n Like it just doesn't have, you know, political capacity.\n\n57:10.280 --> 57:13.320\n It doesn't have like the ability to come up with policy\n\n57:13.320 --> 57:17.720\n because it's entire culture is like designed around\n\n57:17.720 --> 57:19.960\n resisting much more than it's designed around like,\n\n57:19.960 --> 57:23.240\n you know, actually debating serious policy trade offs.\n\n57:23.240 --> 57:27.200\n And I worry or I guess not so much worry\n\n57:27.200 --> 57:28.280\n because it's already happened.\n\n57:28.280 --> 57:31.920\n I unfortunately think that Bitcoin Cash ended up\n\n57:31.920 --> 57:34.040\n being a victim of this, right?\n\n57:34.040 --> 57:37.120\n Like first, no, there was a split with Bitcoin Cash.\n\n57:37.120 --> 57:39.160\n And then of course, Craig Wright came in\n\n57:39.160 --> 57:43.240\n and you know, Craig Wright was this basically scammer\n\n57:43.240 --> 57:46.280\n who just keeps on pretending that he is Satoshi Nakamoto,\n\n57:46.280 --> 57:47.920\n the inventor of Bitcoin.\n\n57:47.920 --> 57:49.960\n Hey, Craig Wright's legal team, do you hear me?\n\n57:49.960 --> 57:52.200\n Yes, I still think your client is a scammer.\n\n57:52.200 --> 57:53.240\n So sue me.\n\n57:53.240 --> 57:55.160\n This is definitely gonna be death for a search\n\n57:55.160 --> 57:56.960\n because I gotta ask you about Craig.\n\n57:56.960 --> 57:58.800\n I guess these people have been contacting me\n\n57:58.800 --> 58:00.200\n and I'm trying to figure out like,\n\n58:00.200 --> 58:02.520\n what is up with this human being?\n\n58:02.520 --> 58:05.460\n So for people who don't know, there's somebody who is,\n\n58:05.460 --> 58:09.920\n let's start this Satoshi Nakamoto, who is the creator\n\n58:09.920 --> 58:11.720\n of Bitcoin, who's anonymous.\n\n58:11.720 --> 58:14.760\n And actually most really big people\n\n58:14.760 --> 58:19.760\n in the cryptocurrency space do not like yourself\n\n58:20.120 --> 58:23.240\n and others do not dare claim that they are even\n\n58:23.240 --> 58:25.200\n for fun Satoshi Nakamoto.\n\n58:25.200 --> 58:27.320\n In fact, if Satoshi Nakamoto is still alive\n\n58:27.320 --> 58:29.800\n and is like, if say you were Satoshi Nakamoto,\n\n58:29.800 --> 58:32.000\n it seems like the thing he would do is probably\n\n58:32.000 --> 58:35.760\n or she is trying to remain anonymous.\n\n58:35.760 --> 58:39.320\n On the flip side of that, there's a guy named Craig Wright\n\n58:39.320 --> 58:42.120\n who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact\n\n58:42.120 --> 58:45.920\n Satoshi Nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people.\n\n58:45.920 --> 58:49.420\n So on him, if we could just linger on him,\n\n58:49.420 --> 58:51.120\n what do you make of this character?\n\n58:52.120 --> 58:54.420\n What are we supposed to make of this character?\n\n58:54.420 --> 58:56.120\n Should he be ignored?\n\n58:56.120 --> 58:58.700\n Is there any possible truth to his claims?\n\n58:59.880 --> 59:01.120\n What do you make of him?\n\n59:01.120 --> 59:03.600\n The analogy that's at the top of my head\n\n59:03.600 --> 59:06.000\n will get a bit political, but that's fine.\n\n59:06.000 --> 59:07.600\n You've had Michael Malice.\n\n59:07.600 --> 59:10.160\n So I guess I view Craig Wright\n\n59:10.160 --> 59:12.480\n as being kind of like a Donald Trump figure\n\n59:12.480 --> 59:15.160\n in that he's not very intellectual,\n\n59:15.160 --> 59:17.320\n but I think he gets a big audience\n\n59:17.320 --> 59:22.320\n because he says things that play to the resentments\n\n59:23.480 --> 59:25.080\n that people have and he says things\n\n59:25.080 --> 59:27.840\n that people wants to hear.\n\n59:27.840 --> 59:30.120\n Like in the wake of this block size war,\n\n59:30.120 --> 59:32.640\n the big blockers did feel very disenchanted.\n\n59:32.640 --> 59:35.360\n They felt that Bitcoin always had this vision\n\n59:35.360 --> 59:37.000\n that we were supposed to just keep increasing\n\n59:37.000 --> 59:39.200\n the block size and Bitcoin is peer to peer cash.\n\n59:39.200 --> 59:40.520\n It says so in the white paper.\n\n59:40.520 --> 59:43.480\n And then this elitist clique of core devs\n\n59:43.480 --> 59:45.560\n just came in and said, no, no, no,\n\n59:45.560 --> 59:47.720\n we're gonna impose this totally different vision.\n\n59:47.720 --> 59:49.240\n And if you ever want your scalability,\n\n59:49.240 --> 59:51.000\n you'll have to wait for us to create\n\n59:51.000 --> 59:53.400\n this totally unproven fancy technology\n\n59:53.400 --> 59:54.400\n called the lightning network\n\n59:54.400 --> 59:56.920\n that works under completely different principles.\n\n59:56.920 --> 59:58.440\n And they were very angry at this.\n\n59:58.440 --> 1:00:01.880\n And I mean, I think a lot of that anger is justified,\n\n1:00:01.880 --> 1:00:06.880\n but at the same time, when people are in that mental state,\n\n1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:10.320\n like it's very easy for you to just kind of like latch on.\n\n1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:13.720\n And if you find someone who expresses anger\n\n1:00:13.720 --> 1:00:15.760\n at the same things that you're angry at,\n\n1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:19.720\n and also like it seems like someone who's strong\n\n1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:22.880\n and seems like someone who might be good to rally around,\n\n1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:24.920\n it's very easy to just like get behind that.\n\n1:00:24.920 --> 1:00:26.720\n But that extra part about it where he's\n\n1:00:26.720 --> 1:00:29.480\n Satoshi Nakamura, I don't understand why that's necessary.\n\n1:00:29.480 --> 1:00:33.200\n I think that's, he could have done it without that,\n\n1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:36.720\n but that just, it's a marketing strategy.\n\n1:00:36.720 --> 1:00:38.440\n Like it sort of gives him more salience.\n\n1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:40.800\n Like there's other big block personalities, right?\n\n1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:43.000\n Well, what's the difference with Craig Wright?\n\n1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.800\n He's not just a big block personality,\n\n1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.640\n he's potentially Satoshi.\n\n1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:52.000\n And he did say all the big block things, right?\n\n1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.560\n Like he talked about how,\n\n1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.040\n oh, the concept of a fee market is fundamentally\n\n1:00:56.040 --> 1:01:00.160\n like economically wrong and it should be a free market\n\n1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:02.000\n and you should be able to have blocks as big as you want.\n\n1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:03.560\n So like he repeated all the talking points.\n\n1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:07.560\n And so a lot of people were kind of sucked into that, right?\n\n1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:12.280\n And so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate\n\n1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:15.240\n a big part of the Bitcoin cash community for a long time.\n\n1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:18.520\n And then eventually, of course,\n\n1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:20.960\n more and more people started to catch on.\n\n1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:22.600\n He would just say technical things\n\n1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:24.080\n that are completely wrong, right?\n\n1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:27.720\n Like one example of this that I remember\n\n1:01:27.720 --> 1:01:32.720\n is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits\n\n1:01:32.880 --> 1:01:36.360\n and two to the power of 256 bits, right?\n\n1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.640\n So the difference is, it's like the difference\n\n1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:42.640\n between 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers, right?\n\n1:01:42.640 --> 1:01:46.720\n And because of this, like he made this arguments\n\n1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:50.520\n that said that Bitcoin's elliptic curve\n\n1:01:50.520 --> 1:01:52.480\n is friendly to cryptographic pairings.\n\n1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:54.440\n Like you don't have to understand what that is,\n\n1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:55.560\n but if you want to know,\n\n1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:58.280\n I have articles on both at Vitalik.ca.\n\n1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:01.400\n But basically he made this like technical argument\n\n1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:03.280\n that really hedged on this point.\n\n1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:04.800\n And then when people pressed him on,\n\n1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:06.960\n it was like, yes, but no, no, like what?\n\n1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:09.520\n Look, exactly, the height is like what?\n\n1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:11.160\n Two to the 256 bits.\n\n1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:14.560\n That's a very tiny amount of information.\n\n1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:17.000\n No, no, no, no, two to the 256 bits\n\n1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.440\n is more than the amount of information in the universe.\n\n1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:22.680\n And like he equivocated and kind of like preyed\n\n1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:25.480\n on people's inability to understand\n\n1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:26.640\n that mathematical nuance.\n\n1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:27.840\n And I called him out.\n\n1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:30.240\n And eventually I even called him out in person\n\n1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:31.800\n at this conference in Seoul.\n\n1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:34.600\n Like I just stood up and asked,\n\n1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.800\n hey, conference organizer,\n\n1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:39.480\n why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference?\n\n1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:42.920\n And I remember even some big blockers at the time\n\n1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:44.440\n getting angry at me.\n\n1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:47.720\n But eventually they did get rid of him.\n\n1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:50.760\n And then Craig, well, basically Craig Wright\n\n1:02:50.760 --> 1:02:52.800\n was forced to split off\n\n1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:54.680\n because the rest of the community refused\n\n1:02:54.680 --> 1:02:56.800\n to accept some network change that he wanted.\n\n1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:59.040\n And so then there was the BCH and BSP.\n\n1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:00.960\n And then in the Bitcoin Cash community,\n\n1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:02.640\n there was this drama of,\n\n1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.880\n are they going to add a developer fund\n\n1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:07.080\n where they redirect 12 and a half percent of the revenue\n\n1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:08.640\n from the miners to the devs?\n\n1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:11.320\n And according to the libertarian not aggression principle,\n\n1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:12.720\n is this technically theft?\n\n1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:17.720\n Like his understanding of the technical depths\n\n1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:20.600\n of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way\n\n1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:23.200\n that Satoshi Nakamoto certainly would not.\n\n1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:24.080\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:27.560\n But the point is that even after Craig Wright got expunged,\n\n1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:30.440\n the Bitcoin Cash community kept having these disagreements.\n\n1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:34.000\n And now after this development funds dispute,\n\n1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.800\n there was a further split between Bitcoin Cash and ABC.\n\n1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:41.560\n So the branch continues to extend.\n\n1:03:41.560 --> 1:03:43.800\n So in that way, it's disappointing\n\n1:03:43.800 --> 1:03:46.240\n to see those kinds of splitting that was never resolved.\n\n1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:47.080\n It is.\n\n1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.800\n I would have definitely like wanted to see more\n\n1:03:49.800 --> 1:03:54.000\n of a kind of like the principled coin\n\n1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.560\n with like tries to be Bitcoin,\n\n1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:59.800\n but follows consistent big block values.\n\n1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:03.600\n But I know maybe I should just like stop expecting projects\n\n1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:06.160\n that I have no involvement in to care at all\n\n1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:07.160\n about what my values are.\n\n1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:09.360\n And like maybe Ethereum just like is.\n\n1:04:09.360 --> 1:04:13.320\n I think you have a powerful voice\n\n1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:14.760\n and you can inspire other projects\n\n1:04:14.760 --> 1:04:19.000\n to live up to their best possible selves.\n\n1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:24.000\n Okay, so that's the layer one approach.\n\n1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:28.080\n The other layer one within Ethereum\n\n1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:29.320\n is the idea of sharding.\n\n1:04:29.320 --> 1:04:30.160\n Yes.\n\n1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:31.920\n What the heck is sharding?\n\n1:04:31.920 --> 1:04:32.760\n Okay.\n\n1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:33.600\n What does the future of sharding look like?\n\n1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:36.320\n Right, so to summarize that big long tangent\n\n1:04:36.320 --> 1:04:37.160\n that we just went into.\n\n1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:38.960\n It's a beautiful tangent by the way.\n\n1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.040\n It's the basic tangent.\n\n1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.800\n And I think like crypto is just one\n\n1:04:42.800 --> 1:04:44.720\n of the most underrated aspects of crypto\n\n1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:48.240\n is I think how you can like analyze the sociology\n\n1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.960\n and the politics and the anthropology.\n\n1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:53.000\n And I'm sure Dan Carlin would have fun exploring\n\n1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.080\n the space at some point.\n\n1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:56.160\n But like the core trade off, right?\n\n1:04:56.160 --> 1:04:58.200\n Is that if you scale blockchains the dumb way\n\n1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.960\n just by increasing the parameters,\n\n1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:01.840\n then eventually you just make it harder and harder\n\n1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:04.960\n to participate as a node and you end up with a system\n\n1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:07.880\n where there's like 20 computers running the whole thing.\n\n1:05:07.880 --> 1:05:09.600\n And it's just very centralized.\n\n1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:11.760\n So sharding basically says, well,\n\n1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:13.680\n instead of just increasing the parameters,\n\n1:05:13.680 --> 1:05:15.600\n what we're going to do is we're going to change\n\n1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:19.080\n the blockchain architecture in such a way\n\n1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:22.720\n that each individual node in the blockchain\n\n1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:25.640\n only needs to store a small portion of the data\n\n1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:27.280\n and only needs to process a small portion\n\n1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:28.840\n of the transactions.\n\n1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:30.680\n So you can think about it as being like inspired\n\n1:05:30.680 --> 1:05:31.520\n by BitTorrent, right?\n\n1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.320\n Like on BitTorrent, there's no such thing\n\n1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:35.960\n as a BitTorrent full node that has every movie, right?\n\n1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:38.480\n You know, the work is like split up among a huge number\n\n1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:40.600\n of computers and like that makes sense.\n\n1:05:40.600 --> 1:05:42.440\n That's, you know, the only sane way\n\n1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:43.840\n to scale a system like that.\n\n1:05:45.240 --> 1:05:47.960\n And if they actually tried making a version of BitTorrent\n\n1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:50.360\n that required full nodes that store every movie,\n\n1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.760\n then, you know, it would have like zero censorship\n\n1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:54.720\n resistance and it would just like, you know,\n\n1:05:54.720 --> 1:05:56.280\n be dead in an instant.\n\n1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:59.320\n So the challenge with taking that model\n\n1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.040\n and applying it to blockchains, right?\n\n1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:04.040\n Is that blockchains aren't just about like spreading data\n\n1:06:04.040 --> 1:06:07.840\n around, they're about agreeing on exactly what data\n\n1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:10.440\n was spread around and ensuring that everything\n\n1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:12.480\n that you agree on actually is correct.\n\n1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:14.920\n And so you have this paradox where let's say\n\n1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:18.600\n you want to have a system that supports 10,000 transactions\n\n1:06:18.600 --> 1:06:20.760\n a second, but each computer in the network\n\n1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:25.000\n can only personally verify a hundred transactions a second.\n\n1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.800\n So how can each computer get a guarantee\n\n1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:31.760\n about the other 9,900 without actually going\n\n1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:33.080\n and verifying them themselves?\n\n1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:37.360\n And it turns out that there are some,\n\n1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:40.320\n like a bundle of different tricks that can do that, right?\n\n1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:43.720\n So like one of them is just random sampling.\n\n1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:46.120\n So the idea behind random sampling is like,\n\n1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:49.520\n let's say for simplicity, this is a proof of stake chain\n\n1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:53.320\n and you have 10,000 validators, validators are like,\n\n1:06:53.320 --> 1:06:56.040\n you know, the stakers and like for simplicity,\n\n1:06:56.040 --> 1:06:57.920\n we'll assume they all have the same number of coins, right?\n\n1:06:57.920 --> 1:06:59.880\n If someone has more coins, we'll just kind of split them up\n\n1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:01.640\n and pretend they're 10 stakers.\n\n1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:05.720\n Then you do like some random shuffling\n\n1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:08.320\n and you basically say, these random hundred validators\n\n1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.640\n are assigned to validate this block.\n\n1:07:10.640 --> 1:07:11.920\n These random hundred validators\n\n1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:13.120\n are assigned to validate this block.\n\n1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:14.280\n These random hundred validators\n\n1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:16.080\n are assigned to validate this block.\n\n1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:19.640\n And so each individual computer only gets assigned\n\n1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:21.400\n to validate like a small piece,\n\n1:07:21.400 --> 1:07:23.520\n but then the way that the information\n\n1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:25.560\n about like what's valid gets passed around, right?\n\n1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:30.400\n Is that when these hundred participants validate a block,\n\n1:07:30.400 --> 1:07:33.080\n they all sign a message basically saying like,\n\n1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:35.200\n yes, we agree that this block is valid.\n\n1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:37.680\n And then like they combine that signature into one\n\n1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:39.480\n and then they broadcast that signature.\n\n1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:40.760\n And then everyone else,\n\n1:07:40.760 --> 1:07:42.400\n instead of verifying the blocks directly,\n\n1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.280\n just verifies that signature, right?\n\n1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:46.240\n And so if I see the signature,\n\n1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:49.080\n I'm not directly convinced that that block is valid,\n\n1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:52.520\n but what I am convinced of is that out of this committee\n\n1:07:52.520 --> 1:07:56.000\n of this randomly selected group of a hundred validators,\n\n1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.320\n let's say at least 70 of them agree\n\n1:07:58.320 --> 1:07:59.520\n that this block is valid.\n\n1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:02.120\n And so if I trust that the majority\n\n1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:04.200\n of these participants are all honest,\n\n1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:06.400\n then because it's all randomly selected,\n\n1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:08.200\n the attacker can't just like force themselves\n\n1:08:08.200 --> 1:08:09.280\n into one committee.\n\n1:08:09.280 --> 1:08:13.800\n And so the attacker is gonna be evenly spread out too.\n\n1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:17.760\n And so if the entire set of validators is mostly honest,\n\n1:08:17.760 --> 1:08:19.400\n every committee is gonna be mostly honest.\n\n1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:22.480\n And so like bad blocks are not gonna go through, right?\n\n1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.760\n So that's like one simple form of sharding.\n\n1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:26.920\n There was also other more clever things that you can do.\n\n1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:29.960\n So for example, there's this concept of a ZK snarks, right?\n\n1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:31.600\n I'll call it as your knowledge proofs.\n\n1:08:31.600 --> 1:08:34.440\n So this is the idea that you can make a cryptographic proof\n\n1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:39.440\n that says, I verified or I ran some complex computation\n\n1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:43.320\n on this piece of data and I got this answer.\n\n1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:45.680\n And so if you make these kinds of proofs,\n\n1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:47.640\n then like if you see a ZK snark\n\n1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:49.120\n that says some block is valid,\n\n1:08:49.120 --> 1:08:51.920\n then you're convinced that that block is valid.\n\n1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:55.320\n And even if everyone in that committee is evil,\n\n1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:58.280\n like they have no way of making a valid proof\n\n1:08:58.280 --> 1:08:59.680\n for a bad block, right?\n\n1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:00.840\n Like, because the proof itself,\n\n1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:03.560\n like it is a proof that you did the computation\n\n1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.920\n where that proof is much easier to verify\n\n1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:08.800\n than just running the computation yourself.\n\n1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:13.800\n And there's once again, super awesome mathematical\n\n1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:17.880\n or cryptographic magic behind making ZK snarks work.\n\n1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:20.120\n But it gives you a little bit of a leg up\n\n1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:23.280\n over the 51% honest assumption.\n\n1:09:23.280 --> 1:09:25.520\n So it's a little hack that improves upon the random\n\n1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.440\n sampling thing.\n\n1:09:26.440 --> 1:09:27.280\n Exactly.\n\n1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:28.320\n And like, there's other hacks, right?\n\n1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:30.760\n Like there is another hack called data availability\n\n1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:32.800\n sampling that allows you to make sure that the data\n\n1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:35.080\n in the blocks was actually published.\n\n1:09:35.080 --> 1:09:37.960\n But like, basically, like if you stack a couple\n\n1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:39.520\n of these tricks on top of each other,\n\n1:09:39.520 --> 1:09:41.560\n you can create a system where like I,\n\n1:09:41.560 --> 1:09:44.160\n as an individual participant can be convinced\n\n1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.640\n that everything that's going on in this distributed\n\n1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:49.360\n blockchain thing is correct without actually personally\n\n1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:51.000\n checking more than like a percent of it.\n\n1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:52.040\n So that's sharding.\n\n1:09:52.040 --> 1:09:52.880\n That's sharding.\n\n1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:57.880\n But the, as I understand, maybe correct me on this,\n\n1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:03.120\n is in the space of Ethereum, the sharding happens\n\n1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:05.360\n on some fixed number.\n\n1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:07.920\n Like the split is on some fixed number.\n\n1:10:07.920 --> 1:10:11.440\n I think it's 64 is the currently sort of proposed number.\n\n1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:15.760\n So how does that help scaling?\n\n1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.080\n Is it just the fixed constant scaling by 64?\n\n1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:21.800\n And is that a way to achieve those crazy,\n\n1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:25.200\n the crazy amount of scaling that seems to be required\n\n1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:28.320\n to use cryptocurrency for purchasing?\n\n1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:30.520\n So doing like competing with credit cards\n\n1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:31.880\n and Visa and so on.\n\n1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:34.640\n So first, I think like the 64 can be hard forked up\n\n1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:35.800\n over time.\n\n1:10:35.800 --> 1:10:39.920\n So we've set it so that like there's theoretically space\n\n1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:42.200\n in the data structure for 1024 shards,\n\n1:10:42.200 --> 1:10:44.200\n it's just that 64 of them are turned on.\n\n1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.280\n There are challenges with having more shards\n\n1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:49.560\n because like you have to have logic that just like checks\n\n1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:51.280\n and manages all of those shards.\n\n1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:52.560\n And if there's too many of them,\n\n1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:54.720\n then that becomes too expensive.\n\n1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:57.600\n But even still, you can improve quite a bit.\n\n1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:00.440\n And then the other thing that we're doing is\n\n1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:03.000\n if what we're getting maximum scalability\n\n1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.760\n by combining rollups and sharding.\n\n1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:07.800\n So this might be a good time to talk about rollups.\n\n1:11:07.800 --> 1:11:09.320\n What are rollups?\n\n1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:11.680\n Now we're moving into layer two ideas.\n\n1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:12.520\n Yes.\n\n1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:17.520\n So the idea behind a rollup is basically that,\n\n1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:22.520\n so instead of just publishing transactions\n\n1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.520\n directly on chain and having everyone do all of the checking\n\n1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:28.960\n of those transactions,\n\n1:11:28.960 --> 1:11:31.080\n what you do is you create a system\n\n1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:36.080\n where users send their transactions to some central party\n\n1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:37.960\n called an aggregator.\n\n1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:40.120\n And like, well, theoretically, you can have a system\n\n1:11:40.120 --> 1:11:41.600\n where like the aggregator switches around\n\n1:11:41.600 --> 1:11:43.160\n or where anyone can be an aggregator.\n\n1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:46.440\n So it's still like permissionless to send things.\n\n1:11:46.440 --> 1:11:51.160\n Then what the aggregator does is they strip out\n\n1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:55.120\n all of the transaction data that like is not relevant\n\n1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.760\n to helping people update the state.\n\n1:11:57.760 --> 1:11:58.680\n So when I say the state,\n\n1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:01.040\n this is a very important kind of technical term\n\n1:12:01.040 --> 1:12:01.880\n for blockchains.\n\n1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:04.640\n I mean, like account balances, code,\n\n1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:08.680\n like things that are like memory,\n\n1:12:08.680 --> 1:12:10.400\n internal memory of smart contracts,\n\n1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:12.040\n like basically everything the blockchain\n\n1:12:12.040 --> 1:12:14.560\n actually has to keep track of and remember, right?\n\n1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:17.680\n So you just put in,\n\n1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.240\n you take all these transactions,\n\n1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:22.840\n strip out all the data that's not relevant\n\n1:12:22.840 --> 1:12:24.920\n to telling people how to update the state.\n\n1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:26.720\n And then you take the data that's needed\n\n1:12:26.720 --> 1:12:27.560\n to update the state,\n\n1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.000\n and then you like really compress it, right?\n\n1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.920\n So like, for example, if we say,\n\n1:12:31.920 --> 1:12:35.640\n I, Vitalik, have an account that's 0xAB58,\n\n1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:37.720\n blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it's 20 bytes.\n\n1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:38.840\n Well, instead we can say,\n\n1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:44.800\n well, I have an account that is number 1874224 in the tree.\n\n1:12:44.800 --> 1:12:46.360\n And that goes down from 20 bytes\n\n1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:48.080\n to just like an index and a position,\n\n1:12:48.080 --> 1:12:49.120\n which is three bytes, right?\n\n1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:51.480\n So you use all sorts of these fancy compression tricks,\n\n1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:53.160\n and you basically just,\n\n1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:55.600\n instead of publishing all these transactions,\n\n1:12:55.600 --> 1:12:58.480\n you publish this like tiny compressed blob, right?\n\n1:12:58.480 --> 1:13:00.280\n So the amount of data that goes on chain\n\n1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.720\n goes down by maybe about a factor of 10, right?\n\n1:13:02.720 --> 1:13:04.160\n And then the second thing is that\n\n1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.200\n you don't do the computation on chain,\n\n1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.520\n instead you do the computation off chain,\n\n1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:11.200\n and there's one of two ways to do this, right?\n\n1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:12.520\n One is called a ZK rollup,\n\n1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:15.800\n which is you just provide a ZK SNARK that basically says,\n\n1:13:15.800 --> 1:13:17.840\n hey, look, I did this computation,\n\n1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:21.240\n and I have this proof that here's, you know,\n\n1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:23.400\n some hash of the result and it's correct.\n\n1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:24.800\n And then you stick it on chain,\n\n1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:26.720\n and everyone verifies this one proof\n\n1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.120\n instead of verifying all these transactions.\n\n1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.600\n And then the other approach is called an optimistic rollup,\n\n1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:33.960\n which is basically made of the scheme where,\n\n1:13:33.960 --> 1:13:36.480\n like, first someone says like,\n\n1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:39.520\n hey, this is what I think the result of applying\n\n1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:40.800\n these transactions is.\n\n1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:41.880\n And then someone else can say,\n\n1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:43.680\n I disagree, the result is different.\n\n1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.720\n And only if two people disagree,\n\n1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:50.040\n do you actually just like publish all of the data\n\n1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:52.440\n and run that whole block on chain.\n\n1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:53.640\n So if there's disagreements,\n\n1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:55.960\n then you just like run everything on chain\n\n1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:58.720\n and whoever was wrong, like loses a lot of money, right?\n\n1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:00.360\n So like disagreements are very rare\n\n1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:01.640\n and they're very expensive.\n\n1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:02.760\n And then a ZK rollup,\n\n1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:05.160\n you don't even rely on this like challenging game at all,\n\n1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:06.840\n you just rely on a proof.\n\n1:14:06.840 --> 1:14:09.760\n So the core principle is basically that\n\n1:14:09.760 --> 1:14:11.920\n instead of lots of transactions\n\n1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:14.680\n and everyone verifies every transaction,\n\n1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:16.720\n it is you take the transactions,\n\n1:14:16.720 --> 1:14:20.360\n you strip them down and compress them as much as possible,\n\n1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:22.440\n then stick that on the blockchain.\n\n1:14:22.440 --> 1:14:24.520\n You do need to stick something on the blockchain\n\n1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:27.520\n just so that everyone else can like keep up to date\n\n1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:30.080\n with the state so they know what all the contracts are,\n\n1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:31.400\n what all the balances are and all of this,\n\n1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.440\n but it's a very small amount of data.\n\n1:14:33.440 --> 1:14:36.560\n And then you use one of these other off chain games,\n\n1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:39.840\n could be this optimistic game, could be a ZK snark\n\n1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:43.080\n to just prove that somebody out there did the computation\n\n1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:44.600\n and the result is correct, right?\n\n1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:47.640\n So you're pushing like 90% of the work off chain\n\n1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:50.160\n and then, well, 90% of the data\n\n1:14:50.160 --> 1:14:52.720\n and 99% of the computation off chain,\n\n1:14:52.720 --> 1:14:54.360\n and then you still have 10% of the data\n\n1:14:54.360 --> 1:14:56.280\n and 1% of the computation on chain.\n\n1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:59.960\n And so your scalability goes up by a factor of about 100.\n\n1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:02.440\n So these systems are already alive\n\n1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:05.480\n for some applications, right?\n\n1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:07.320\n So there's something called loopering,\n\n1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:10.160\n which is just a ZK roll up for payments, right?\n\n1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:15.160\n So you can have assets inside of the loopering system\n\n1:15:15.320 --> 1:15:17.360\n and you can go around and transfer them,\n\n1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:24.560\n and you get like much lower transaction fees, right?\n\n1:15:24.560 --> 1:15:28.400\n Like instead of $5, you'd have to pay like less than 5 cents.\n\n1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:31.560\n But the only problem is that this only supports\n\n1:15:31.560 --> 1:15:33.000\n a couple of applications right now,\n\n1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.560\n like making one that supports anything\n\n1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.760\n that you can do on Ethereum just takes a bit more work,\n\n1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:40.040\n but that's being done as well, right?\n\n1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:43.400\n So like within a few months, I'm expecting fully Ethereum\n\n1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.760\n capable roll ups to be available as well.\n\n1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:51.800\n So roll ups, just summarizing,\n\n1:15:51.800 --> 1:15:53.120\n do most of the work off chain,\n\n1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:55.920\n put only a little bit on chain, factor of 100 scaling,\n\n1:15:55.920 --> 1:15:57.960\n sharding, another factor of 100 scaling,\n\n1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:00.520\n 100 times 100 factor of 10,000,\n\n1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:02.360\n hundreds of thousands of transactions a second,\n\n1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:04.200\n and like, you know, there's your scalability.\n\n1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:05.680\n Okay, so you achieve scalability,\n\n1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:08.120\n you can do a large number of transactions very quickly\n\n1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:11.480\n and the cost of doing those transactions are much lower.\n\n1:16:11.480 --> 1:16:15.800\n You wrote that in the long term ZK roll ups\n\n1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:18.680\n are going to win in terms of layer two technology.\n\n1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:20.960\n Specifically you wrote, in general,\n\n1:16:20.960 --> 1:16:23.800\n my own view is that in the short term,\n\n1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:25.800\n optimistic roll ups, as you were saying,\n\n1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:28.880\n are likely to win out of general purpose EVM computation\n\n1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:33.880\n and ZK roll ups are likely to win out for simple payments,\n\n1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.720\n exchange and other application specific use cases,\n\n1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:39.240\n just as you were saying.\n\n1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:40.880\n But in the medium to long term,\n\n1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:44.160\n ZK roll ups will win out in all use cases\n\n1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:48.080\n as ZK SNARK technology improves.\n\n1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.080\n Why do you think ZK roll ups are going to win\n\n1:16:53.080 --> 1:16:55.960\n the big picture battle over layer two technologies?\n\n1:16:55.960 --> 1:16:59.400\n So I think ZK roll ups, like once you accept\n\n1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:03.120\n that the technology works are just like conceptually simpler\n\n1:17:03.120 --> 1:17:04.640\n and they have nicer properties.\n\n1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:07.200\n The reason is that they do not have this concept\n\n1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:08.040\n of a challenge game, right?\n\n1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:10.480\n Like, as I mentioned in an optimistic roll up,\n\n1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:13.680\n the way that you ensure that the results are correct\n\n1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:15.200\n is that you let one person submit\n\n1:17:15.200 --> 1:17:16.760\n and like they just submit with no proof.\n\n1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.960\n They just say, here's what I think the result is.\n\n1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.880\n And then if someone else disagrees,\n\n1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:22.200\n they make their own submission.\n\n1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:23.920\n And then if you have two disagreeing submissions,\n\n1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:25.720\n then you actually publish it on Chase.\n\n1:17:25.720 --> 1:17:27.520\n And then you see who's right.\n\n1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:30.760\n But for this to work, like you need to actually wait\n\n1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:32.240\n for someone to disagree, right?\n\n1:17:32.240 --> 1:17:34.400\n So like, for example, if I have an asset inside\n\n1:17:34.400 --> 1:17:37.000\n of an optimistic roll up and I wants to withdraw it,\n\n1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:38.960\n then I actually have to wait a week to withdraw it.\n\n1:17:38.960 --> 1:17:43.360\n Because like, if the block that contains my withdrawal\n\n1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:44.600\n turned out to be invalid,\n\n1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:46.000\n then there needs to be space for someone\n\n1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:47.520\n to disagree with it, right?\n\n1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:48.720\n Whereas with a ZK roll up,\n\n1:17:48.720 --> 1:17:50.200\n like you don't need time for disagreeing\n\n1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:51.320\n because you just have a proof, right?\n\n1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:52.920\n As soon as a block is submitted,\n\n1:17:52.920 --> 1:17:55.880\n there's a proof and you know it's correct.\n\n1:17:55.880 --> 1:17:59.320\n So if disagreements, especially in the longterm are sparse,\n\n1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:03.360\n then you don't want to do the optimistic,\n\n1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:05.960\n the game theoretic thing, you wanna do the ZK stock.\n\n1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:08.120\n Right, the ZK stuff is just,\n\n1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:09.800\n like you can win a ZK roll up,\n\n1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.640\n you can withdraw immediately.\n\n1:18:11.640 --> 1:18:14.480\n You don't have to like worry about the economics\n\n1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:15.960\n of proving as much, right?\n\n1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:18.360\n There's just like fewer issues.\n\n1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:21.720\n The reason why ZK roll ups are not winning everywhere today\n\n1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:24.800\n is because ZK stocks are still a crazy new technology,\n\n1:18:24.800 --> 1:18:27.880\n right, like this is something that 10 years ago,\n\n1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:31.240\n it existed only in theory and there was none in practice.\n\n1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:32.920\n Then, eight years ago,\n\n1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:34.520\n people were just getting excited about it\n\n1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:37.040\n in Bitcoin conferences for the first time.\n\n1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:40.760\n Like four years, starting four years ago\n\n1:18:40.760 --> 1:18:42.360\n or three and a half years ago even,\n\n1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:43.960\n that was the first time you were able to make\n\n1:18:43.960 --> 1:18:46.760\n any ZK stock based anything on Ethereum.\n\n1:18:46.760 --> 1:18:48.560\n And then people started making them\n\n1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.080\n and ZK technology has only really become efficient enough\n\n1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:53.760\n to do a lot of things within the past\n\n1:18:53.760 --> 1:18:55.800\n maybe one and a half years.\n\n1:18:55.800 --> 1:19:00.280\n So it's new technology, it's crazy technology,\n\n1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:02.840\n it's admittedly scary technology.\n\n1:19:02.840 --> 1:19:03.840\n If you wanna learn more,\n\n1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:06.320\n I also have an article about this on Vitality.ca.\n\n1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:07.880\n It's actually really, really good.\n\n1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:12.200\n You're, most of your writing, it goes,\n\n1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:14.000\n it's technical but it's accessible.\n\n1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:17.360\n I highly, highly recommend to check out Vitality's articles\n\n1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:20.360\n and blogs, whatever you call them on the website.\n\n1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:22.600\n It's brilliant summary of the work.\n\n1:19:22.600 --> 1:19:25.640\n Actually, Ethereum documentation period is really good.\n\n1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:28.000\n I think that's somewhat crowdsourced.\n\n1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.440\n That documentation is really, really accessible\n\n1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:31.280\n and brilliant.\n\n1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:36.240\n But let me ask about sort of other approaches\n\n1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:39.440\n to layer two, like side chains.\n\n1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:42.400\n So the one popular one is Polygon.\n\n1:19:42.400 --> 1:19:43.920\n What are your thoughts about Polygon,\n\n1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.000\n which is a layer two network?\n\n1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:49.720\n Is it positive?\n\n1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:51.200\n Is it negative for Ethereum?\n\n1:19:51.200 --> 1:19:52.040\n Is it both?\n\n1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:53.280\n Does it have a future?\n\n1:19:53.280 --> 1:19:58.160\n Which is its own chain, but it's using Ethereum.\n\n1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:00.920\n It's like based on Ethereum essentially.\n\n1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:02.840\n Or maybe you can describe what it is.\n\n1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:06.240\n So I think there's a really big and important difference\n\n1:20:06.240 --> 1:20:09.000\n in security models between rollups and side chains,\n\n1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.600\n which is basically that rollups inherit\n\n1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:13.160\n from the security of Ethereum, right?\n\n1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:17.120\n So if I have coins inside of Loopring or Optimism\n\n1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.920\n or Arbitrum or ZK Sync,\n\n1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:22.880\n then even if everyone else in the world\n\n1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:25.000\n who is participating in these ecosystems\n\n1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.520\n hates me and wants to steal my money,\n\n1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:30.040\n I can still personally make sure\n\n1:20:30.040 --> 1:20:33.560\n that no matter what happens, I get my money out.\n\n1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:35.440\n It might be a bit expensive for me to get my money out\n\n1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:37.800\n and I have to do transactions on the main chain,\n\n1:20:37.800 --> 1:20:39.480\n but I'll be able to do it.\n\n1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:42.320\n Whereas in Polygon, which is a side chain,\n\n1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:45.080\n and so instead of being secured by Ethereum,\n\n1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:48.040\n it's also in part secured by its own\n\n1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.280\n proof of stake consensus with its own token.\n\n1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:53.520\n So if 70% of the whole,\n\n1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.560\n or even 51% of the holders of Polygon tokens\n\n1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:59.400\n wanted to take my money in Polygon, they can, right?\n\n1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:03.440\n So that's the, and like, to be fair,\n\n1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.440\n like there aren't even, like the supply,\n\n1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:08.640\n I don't think is even that widely distributed, right?\n\n1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:11.800\n So like potentially you could,\n\n1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:14.640\n this idea of 51% of the token holders\n\n1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:16.080\n coming together and stealing everything,\n\n1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:19.400\n like it's not impossible, right?\n\n1:21:19.400 --> 1:21:21.600\n Where does the scaling of Polygon come from?\n\n1:21:21.600 --> 1:21:26.280\n Like why is it able to process much more transactions\n\n1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:28.200\n than the Ethereum main chain?\n\n1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:29.560\n What's the idea there?\n\n1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:32.440\n I think in part, like I imagine,\n\n1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:34.520\n I'm not sure exactly what its capacity level is,\n\n1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:36.720\n but like I imagine it has a higher capacity\n\n1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:38.680\n because it's a bit more willing\n\n1:21:38.680 --> 1:21:40.600\n to take centralization trade offs.\n\n1:21:40.600 --> 1:21:43.000\n And then another thing is that like,\n\n1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.880\n if the Ethereum ecosystem,\n\n1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:46.520\n like even if it did not do that, right?\n\n1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:48.080\n If you think about an Ethereum ecosystem\n\n1:21:48.080 --> 1:21:49.920\n hypothetically scaling with side chains,\n\n1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:52.480\n then you would have a hundred copies of Polygon\n\n1:21:52.480 --> 1:21:54.280\n and they would each have their own tokens,\n\n1:21:54.280 --> 1:21:55.520\n they would each have their own chains.\n\n1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:57.600\n And so even if each one of those chains\n\n1:21:57.600 --> 1:22:00.040\n was only as scalable as Ethereum,\n\n1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:02.920\n you could still, like the total sum of them\n\n1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:05.120\n would still be a hundred times more than Ethereum.\n\n1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:05.960\n Okay.\n\n1:22:07.640 --> 1:22:09.640\n The thing that I want to say in Polygon's favor\n\n1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:11.480\n just to be very fair to them,\n\n1:22:11.480 --> 1:22:14.000\n like I really, you know,\n\n1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.400\n I definitely really, you know,\n\n1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:16.920\n respect the work that they're doing.\n\n1:22:16.920 --> 1:22:20.560\n So, you know, start with a bit with that word\n\n1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:23.560\n of not criticism caution, right?\n\n1:22:23.560 --> 1:22:28.560\n Like it's that they made this kind of deliberate trade off\n\n1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:30.440\n for very pragmatic reasons,\n\n1:22:30.440 --> 1:22:33.160\n which is that the Ethereum ecosystem needs to scale now.\n\n1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.880\n And there are applications that want to do something now.\n\n1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:38.960\n And, you know, if there aren't Ethereum friendly options\n\n1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:40.960\n for them, then like, they're not going to just wait\n\n1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:42.640\n peacefully and do nothing for 12 months.\n\n1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:44.520\n And they're going to go to, you know,\n\n1:22:44.520 --> 1:22:47.480\n either Binance Smart Chain or, you know,\n\n1:22:47.480 --> 1:22:51.000\n one of some other system or potentially something\n\n1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.920\n that just has totally no alignment\n\n1:22:52.920 --> 1:22:55.200\n with Ethereum values whatsoever.\n\n1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:58.080\n But whereas, you know, with Polygon,\n\n1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.800\n like the best thing that you can say in Polygon's favor\n\n1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:02.720\n and against optimism is that, you know,\n\n1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:05.440\n optimism is not live and Polygon is live, right?\n\n1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:08.440\n Like it just takes more work to create a system\n\n1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:12.320\n that has these extra rollups, security features.\n\n1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:14.920\n And so Polygon just said, we're going to be the system\n\n1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:16.320\n that makes the pragmatic trade off.\n\n1:23:16.320 --> 1:23:19.520\n We're going to go, you know, functionality first,\n\n1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:21.800\n and then, you know, we can talk about adding back\n\n1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:22.960\n the security later.\n\n1:23:22.960 --> 1:23:25.080\n So I've talked to them and like, in principle,\n\n1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:28.840\n I think they're very, you know, open to the idea\n\n1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:33.400\n of like adding more security and like becoming more,\n\n1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:36.040\n becoming a rollup or at least, you know,\n\n1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:38.480\n adding a Polygon chain that's a rollup\n\n1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:39.880\n at some point in the future,\n\n1:23:39.880 --> 1:23:41.960\n which is definitely something I think they, you know,\n\n1:23:41.960 --> 1:23:44.080\n absolutely should follow through on.\n\n1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:47.720\n But like the fact that like they exist now,\n\n1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:51.040\n and so, you know, applications can kind of bootstrap now\n\n1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:52.200\n on a chain that, you know,\n\n1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:53.680\n even though its security isn't perfect,\n\n1:23:53.680 --> 1:23:55.480\n at least it exists and people can go use it.\n\n1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:58.760\n And then over time, you know, the chain matures\n\n1:23:58.760 --> 1:24:00.000\n as the applications mature.\n\n1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:03.360\n Like, you know, it's, I think a very reasonable strategy\n\n1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:04.840\n and I'm definitely really happy\n\n1:24:04.840 --> 1:24:06.640\n that they're part of the ecosystem.\n\n1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.760\n Yeah, it's kind of interesting.\n\n1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:14.000\n The history of cryptocurrency has this tension\n\n1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:17.160\n of really good ideas that are hard to implement.\n\n1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:19.480\n So they take longer to implement\n\n1:24:19.480 --> 1:24:23.560\n and ideas that are not as good, but are faster to implement.\n\n1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.600\n This is like the story of like, you have like JavaScript\n\n1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:28.400\n that basically took over the world\n\n1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:31.600\n because it was quick to implement within 10 days.\n\n1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.120\n And then like later kept fixing itself.\n\n1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:36.840\n I don't know what to make of that.\n\n1:24:37.960 --> 1:24:40.280\n Sort of from an engineering perspective,\n\n1:24:40.280 --> 1:24:42.440\n I'm more and more becoming comfortable\n\n1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.400\n and accepting the fact that our whole world\n\n1:24:44.400 --> 1:24:47.160\n will run a technology that's not as good\n\n1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:48.800\n as it could have been.\n\n1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:52.080\n Just because the crappy solution is faster to implement\n\n1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:53.200\n and it sticks.\n\n1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:55.240\n What do you make of that tension?\n\n1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:57.880\n I think the compromise that we've been taking\n\n1:24:57.880 --> 1:25:00.680\n within Ethereum is like when we have to take\n\n1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:03.600\n the crappy solution, we look for crappy solutions\n\n1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:06.560\n that are forward compatible with becoming good over time.\n\n1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:10.240\n When you build the quick and dirty thing,\n\n1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:13.120\n you would still already have ideas in your head\n\n1:25:13.120 --> 1:25:15.640\n about what the more complete thing\n\n1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:18.200\n with all the security features added on would look like.\n\n1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:20.560\n Even if it requires a hard fork?\n\n1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:21.400\n Yes.\n\n1:25:23.160 --> 1:25:26.520\n For example, with sharding, I think it's likely\n\n1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:29.000\n that the first version of sharding that comes out\n\n1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.960\n is not going to have zkstarks and data availability sampling,\n\n1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:32.800\n for example.\n\n1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:34.920\n But we know what these technologies are.\n\n1:25:34.920 --> 1:25:37.800\n We feel like we have wrapped our heads around them.\n\n1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:40.800\n And so we know how to build a system\n\n1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:42.640\n where we can put all the pieces in place\n\n1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:45.000\n so that it becomes very easy to bolt those components\n\n1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:46.640\n on in the future.\n\n1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:50.200\n So if you do things that way, then at the beginning,\n\n1:25:50.200 --> 1:25:53.000\n you can have your system that has the functionality,\n\n1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.600\n but say has less security or less sustainability\n\n1:25:56.600 --> 1:25:58.240\n or less of something else.\n\n1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:02.360\n But then over time, it's designed in such a way\n\n1:26:02.360 --> 1:26:05.560\n that it has this easy on ramp to adding those things.\n\n1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.080\n And if you don't think explicitly\n\n1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:08.680\n about being future compatible,\n\n1:26:08.680 --> 1:26:12.600\n then you do often end up with a quick and dirty solution\n\n1:26:12.600 --> 1:26:14.120\n that backs you into a corner.\n\n1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.000\n And then there are definitely cases\n\n1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.360\n where I think the Ethereum ecosystem has suffered from that.\n\n1:26:18.360 --> 1:26:22.920\n And we have had to expand pretty significant effort\n\n1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:26.880\n on, for example, removing features that we didn't realize\n\n1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:29.760\n that we actually can't sustain.\n\n1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:32.920\n Like one big example is just increasing the gas costs.\n\n1:26:32.920 --> 1:26:36.560\n So like making some operations more expensive\n\n1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:37.760\n because they should be expensive\n\n1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:40.480\n because they actually take a lot of time in the process.\n\n1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:44.120\n So that's making something more expensive,\n\n1:26:44.120 --> 1:26:46.760\n kind of like taking some functionality away.\n\n1:26:46.760 --> 1:26:49.840\n So if you can like be cognizant\n\n1:26:49.840 --> 1:26:52.200\n of where you're likely going into the future,\n\n1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:54.000\n and if you don't know, like even be cognizant\n\n1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.800\n of both the most likely paths that you'll take in the future\n\n1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:59.280\n and coming, like thinking about your roadmap\n\n1:26:59.280 --> 1:27:01.520\n and coming up with a roadmap where you know\n\n1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:04.440\n that like if you wants to do either of those things,\n\n1:27:04.440 --> 1:27:06.600\n then you have a clean path toward it.\n\n1:27:06.600 --> 1:27:09.000\n That's probably the best kind of practical way\n\n1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.000\n to get the best of both worlds that we have.\n\n1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:16.540\n Okay, let's talk about this wonderful process of merging.\n\n1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:22.280\n Okay, so there's the main net,\n\n1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:25.200\n which is the Ethereum 1.0 chain,\n\n1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:27.400\n or the, what should we say,\n\n1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:29.140\n the chain that uses proof of work\n\n1:27:29.140 --> 1:27:30.800\n as a consensus mechanism.\n\n1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:33.520\n And then there's, what is it called?\n\n1:27:33.520 --> 1:27:38.520\n The beacon chain that uses the proof of stake mechanism.\n\n1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:45.240\n And I believe the beacon has been deployed successfully,\n\n1:27:45.240 --> 1:27:49.160\n is working, so that was in December of 2020.\n\n1:27:49.160 --> 1:27:50.440\n There's a bunch of questions around that\n\n1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:51.560\n that's fascinating as well,\n\n1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:54.340\n but I think the most fascinating question\n\n1:27:54.340 --> 1:27:58.600\n is about merging those two.\n\n1:27:58.600 --> 1:28:03.400\n When do the two chains, one that's proof of work,\n\n1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:06.360\n one that's proof of stake, merge?\n\n1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:09.440\n And what are the most difficult parts of this process?\n\n1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:12.040\n Right, so as you've said, right,\n\n1:28:12.040 --> 1:28:15.680\n the way that we have set up this proof of stake transition\n\n1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:18.280\n is that at first, the proof of stake chain\n\n1:28:18.280 --> 1:28:19.600\n just launches on its own, right?\n\n1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.180\n And this is the thing that happened in December.\n\n1:28:22.180 --> 1:28:25.080\n And the proof of stake chain has been running\n\n1:28:25.080 --> 1:28:28.600\n for close to six months now.\n\n1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:30.360\n I mean, by the time people watch this,\n\n1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:31.960\n it might actually be six months.\n\n1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:35.440\n But it isn't actually coming to consensus\n\n1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:37.480\n on anything except for itself, right?\n\n1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:40.040\n So the idea behind that is to just\n\n1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:43.360\n give the proof of stake chain time to mature,\n\n1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:45.480\n time for people to build the ecosystem around it,\n\n1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:48.160\n time to make sure that there aren't any bugs,\n\n1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:49.640\n and just like prove to the community\n\n1:28:49.640 --> 1:28:51.520\n that no proof of stake actually is real,\n\n1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:55.560\n and a full transition is realistic,\n\n1:28:55.560 --> 1:28:57.560\n because the thing that you're transitioning to\n\n1:28:57.560 --> 1:28:59.480\n already exists and already works.\n\n1:28:59.480 --> 1:29:01.200\n And then at some point in the future,\n\n1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:03.040\n you have this event called the merge,\n\n1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:05.960\n where you basically take the activity\n\n1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:08.040\n that's being done inside of the proof of work chain,\n\n1:29:08.040 --> 1:29:10.360\n and you actually move it over into the proof of stake chain,\n\n1:29:10.360 --> 1:29:13.460\n so you get rid of the proof of work side completely.\n\n1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:18.460\n So the way that the merge will work is,\n\n1:29:18.460 --> 1:29:22.000\n it's definitely gone through a few different iterations.\n\n1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.880\n Like the earlier versions of this\n\n1:29:24.880 --> 1:29:26.800\n actually required more work for users\n\n1:29:26.800 --> 1:29:27.840\n and more work for clients.\n\n1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:29.180\n It was much more like,\n\n1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:31.160\n oh, there's this new chain, there's this old chain,\n\n1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:33.600\n and then everyone has to migrate\n\n1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:34.920\n from the old chain to the new chain,\n\n1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:37.400\n and then at some point we'll forget about the old chain.\n\n1:29:37.400 --> 1:29:39.000\n The new version is designed\n\n1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:43.480\n to be much more seamless for users, right?\n\n1:29:43.480 --> 1:29:45.960\n So basically what actually happens is that\n\n1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:49.320\n the old chain basically becomes embedded\n\n1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:50.960\n inside the new chain, right?\n\n1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:54.640\n So starting from the merge transition block,\n\n1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:56.800\n every proof of stake chain block\n\n1:29:56.800 --> 1:29:59.680\n is going to contain a block of the,\n\n1:29:59.680 --> 1:30:01.480\n what we consider now to be,\n\n1:30:01.480 --> 1:30:03.660\n what we consider to be the Ethereum chain today,\n\n1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:05.600\n but we'll call it the execution chain.\n\n1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:08.520\n And then at the same time, to create one of these blocks,\n\n1:30:08.520 --> 1:30:10.880\n you're not going to need proof of work anymore, right?\n\n1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:12.360\n So basically at the same time,\n\n1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:15.000\n you would both get rid of the proof of work requirements\n\n1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:16.560\n for one of these blocks to be valid,\n\n1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:18.840\n but instead you require these blocks\n\n1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:21.560\n to be embedded inside of the proof of stake blocks, right?\n\n1:30:21.560 --> 1:30:24.000\n So you basically have like a chain inside a chain.\n\n1:30:24.000 --> 1:30:28.200\n And this is, from an architecture perspective,\n\n1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:30.080\n you might think it's a little bit suboptimal,\n\n1:30:30.080 --> 1:30:32.240\n but it actually has some nice properties\n\n1:30:32.240 --> 1:30:35.140\n and makes it easier to kind of think about the consensus\n\n1:30:35.140 --> 1:30:38.080\n and think about what we call the execution layer,\n\n1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:40.680\n like transactions and contracts kind of separately\n\n1:30:40.680 --> 1:30:42.120\n and upgrade them separately.\n\n1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:46.500\n And it also just means that the upgrade process\n\n1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:47.740\n is extremely seamless, right?\n\n1:30:47.740 --> 1:30:49.780\n Because from the point of view of a client\n\n1:30:49.780 --> 1:30:50.880\n that's following the chain,\n\n1:30:50.880 --> 1:30:53.400\n you basically have to update nothing, right?\n\n1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:55.680\n You're still following the same chain\n\n1:30:55.680 --> 1:30:56.960\n and follows the same rules,\n\n1:30:56.960 --> 1:30:58.780\n except instead of checking proof of work,\n\n1:30:58.780 --> 1:31:01.020\n you'll switch to checking that these blocks\n\n1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.300\n are embedded inside of blocks of the proof of stake chain.\n\n1:31:03.300 --> 1:31:06.000\n So there'll be this merge block\n\n1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.080\n that will mark this transition.\n\n1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:11.140\n And over time, I guess the new chain\n\n1:31:11.140 --> 1:31:13.480\n will contain the full record\n\n1:31:13.480 --> 1:31:15.320\n of all the transactions that's ever happened\n\n1:31:15.320 --> 1:31:17.600\n on the previous chain, on the old chain.\n\n1:31:17.600 --> 1:31:20.840\n So maybe I'm asking a dumb question here,\n\n1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:25.560\n but in this process, is the new chain going to have\n\n1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:29.040\n all the information of the past transactions?\n\n1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:33.340\n The new chain is not going to hold information\n\n1:31:33.340 --> 1:31:36.720\n from what happened in the Ethereum chain before the merge,\n\n1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:41.720\n right, so Ethereum clients that people are going to use\n\n1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:45.880\n around the time of the merge and soon after the merge,\n\n1:31:45.880 --> 1:31:48.060\n they're probably just going to sync\n\n1:31:48.060 --> 1:31:50.560\n and check the proof of work chain up to the merge,\n\n1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:52.400\n and then they're gonna check the proof of stake chain.\n\n1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:53.520\n But at some point in the future,\n\n1:31:53.520 --> 1:31:55.080\n I think people will just stop bothering\n\n1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.220\n checking the proof of work before the merge.\n\n1:31:57.220 --> 1:32:00.320\n Got it, so that old history information is not important\n\n1:32:01.360 --> 1:32:03.880\n for the future, like if you're operating actively\n\n1:32:03.880 --> 1:32:08.840\n on the new chain, that history is not important to you.\n\n1:32:08.840 --> 1:32:12.360\n It's not important, so it's not strictly important\n\n1:32:12.360 --> 1:32:17.360\n for just like any smart contract\n\n1:32:17.800 --> 1:32:19.920\n or just like applications that run on the blockchain.\n\n1:32:19.920 --> 1:32:21.640\n It can be important to users,\n\n1:32:21.640 --> 1:32:24.160\n and it can be important for some applications,\n\n1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:27.080\n but we're basically saying that like maintaining\n\n1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:29.960\n and serving that is not going to be a simultaneous\n\n1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:32.240\n with the responsibility of every Ethereum node.\n\n1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:34.640\n If you want that information, there can be separate\n\n1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:36.340\n protocols for backing it up.\n\n1:32:36.340 --> 1:32:38.440\n And like these other protocols actually exist, right?\n\n1:32:38.440 --> 1:32:40.180\n Like there's something called the graph,\n\n1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:42.120\n which is doing some history retrieval.\n\n1:32:42.120 --> 1:32:43.960\n Potentially, you can just take that entire chain\n\n1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:45.160\n and stake it on BitTorrent.\n\n1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:48.600\n Like there's lots of ways to like archive it\n\n1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:51.200\n and create kind of customized search protocols for it.\n\n1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:54.520\n So what's your sense why, so there's a Python 2\n\n1:32:54.520 --> 1:32:58.840\n and Python 3, and it took forever for people to switch.\n\n1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:02.880\n What's your sense why this merge has been taking longer\n\n1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:04.420\n than perhaps was expected?\n\n1:33:05.360 --> 1:33:08.760\n I think the biggest reason is just we've been\n\n1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:11.000\n underestimating the technical complexity.\n\n1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:12.480\n There's a lot of technical complexity\n\n1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:14.520\n in making a successful proof of stake chain.\n\n1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:17.120\n There's a lot of technical complexity\n\n1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:20.740\n in actually figuring out the transition process.\n\n1:33:20.740 --> 1:33:22.320\n There's...\n\n1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:24.800\n So that's bigger than social complexity.\n\n1:33:24.800 --> 1:33:27.240\n So the technical complexity you would say\n\n1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:29.760\n is the bigger reason for any delays\n\n1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:31.160\n than the social complexity?\n\n1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:32.400\n I actually think so.\n\n1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:35.080\n I think we've been very fortunate\n\n1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:37.720\n to not have too much social complexity around the merge.\n\n1:33:37.720 --> 1:33:38.960\n So not much drama.\n\n1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:40.320\n No.\n\n1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:42.560\n I think the biggest part of the reason\n\n1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:44.760\n is just because we have been talking\n\n1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:46.040\n about proof of stake and sharding\n\n1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:47.200\n as being part of the roadmap\n\n1:33:47.200 --> 1:33:49.960\n since almost the very beginning of the project, right?\n\n1:33:49.960 --> 1:33:52.400\n Like the very first proof of stake blog post\n\n1:33:52.400 --> 1:33:56.360\n is from January 2014, which was two months\n\n1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:57.760\n after the project started\n\n1:33:57.760 --> 1:34:01.680\n and maybe even a day after the announcement.\n\n1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:06.000\n So proof of stake was not something\n\n1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:09.040\n that we kind of put on anybody by surprise.\n\n1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:11.160\n And then when the Dow fork happened\n\n1:34:11.160 --> 1:34:13.840\n and the people on the ETC side split off,\n\n1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:16.680\n I think it also just happens that a lot of the people\n\n1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:18.840\n that were not willing to stomach the Dow fork\n\n1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:20.400\n and then join the ETC side,\n\n1:34:20.400 --> 1:34:23.120\n they were the more Bitcoiny types.\n\n1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:26.000\n And the more Bitcoiny types do also tend to like proof\n\n1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:26.840\n of work more.\n\n1:34:26.840 --> 1:34:29.160\n And so like that also sort of ended up,\n\n1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:32.600\n sort of like purifying the communities on both sides,\n\n1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:33.440\n I guess.\n\n1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:35.760\n So Ethereum Classic is not switching to proof of stake\n\n1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:38.600\n and they're happy with their setup.\n\n1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:43.600\n And by the time that it came\n\n1:34:43.680 --> 1:34:45.880\n to the beacon chain launching into now,\n\n1:34:45.880 --> 1:34:48.360\n I think the community is very strongly in favor\n\n1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:49.800\n of the proof of stake switch.\n\n1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:55.760\n But let me ask the question that no engineer wants to hear,\n\n1:34:55.760 --> 1:34:57.840\n which is the question of timeline.\n\n1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.480\n When do you think the merge will happen?\n\n1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.240\n Do you have a sense it might happen this year?\n\n1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:07.760\n Do you have a sense it might be pushed\n\n1:35:07.760 --> 1:35:12.760\n towards next year, 2022 or even beyond?\n\n1:35:14.600 --> 1:35:18.240\n I think early 2022 is the most realistic.\n\n1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:22.840\n There's definitely still like an optimistic case\n\n1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:23.800\n of it happening this year,\n\n1:35:23.800 --> 1:35:27.600\n but the realistic thing to count on is definitely\n\n1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:31.400\n the very early part of next year.\n\n1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:33.400\n Is there specific things that stand out to you\n\n1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:37.920\n that will make you feel good about progress\n\n1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:39.560\n if you see it happening?\n\n1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:43.760\n So the thing that we had last month\n\n1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:46.800\n is we had this online hackathon called Rayanism,\n\n1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:50.600\n where basically a bunch of the different client developers\n\n1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:52.520\n that are going to be part of the transition,\n\n1:35:52.520 --> 1:35:54.880\n like hacks together some test nets\n\n1:35:54.880 --> 1:35:57.520\n of the post merge Ethereum chain.\n\n1:35:57.520 --> 1:35:59.440\n So these were only test nets\n\n1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.080\n of what would happen after the merge.\n\n1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:03.320\n They were not test nets of the transition itself.\n\n1:36:03.320 --> 1:36:06.640\n So the thing that people are working on now actually\n\n1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:08.240\n is the transition.\n\n1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:12.320\n So having a full specification\n\n1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:14.520\n of both the transition and post transition,\n\n1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:16.120\n and we have specifications now,\n\n1:36:16.120 --> 1:36:18.720\n but in a realistic way,\n\n1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:20.680\n they'll probably needs to have a couple of changes\n\n1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:23.200\n and have things that continue to be ironed out,\n\n1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:25.560\n and then have a test net\n\n1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:27.960\n that does both the transition and the post transition.\n\n1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:30.080\n And then once you have a test network,\n\n1:36:30.080 --> 1:36:33.000\n then you just have to do a lot of testing and audit it,\n\n1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:38.000\n and then do some runs on not just a specialized test network\n\n1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:39.880\n but on say an existing test network\n\n1:36:39.880 --> 1:36:41.160\n like a Robson or Rinkeby\n\n1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:45.520\n that Ethereum people already significantly use.\n\n1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:46.360\n And if it works,\n\n1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:49.520\n then you can deploy the transition on mainnet.\n\n1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:50.920\n Just as a quick comment,\n\n1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:52.200\n because this is fascinating.\n\n1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:54.320\n In August of last year,\n\n1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:56.720\n there was this Medalla.\n\n1:36:57.520 --> 1:36:59.440\n I believe it's pronounced Medasha.\n\n1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:02.080\n It's a South American subway station.\n\n1:37:02.080 --> 1:37:03.000\n I forget where.\n\n1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:04.520\n But spelled with two Ls.\n\n1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:05.360\n Yeah, yeah,\n\n1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:07.160\n because that's how Spanish works, right?\n\n1:37:07.160 --> 1:37:09.480\n Like the two Ls have a...\n\n1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:10.320\n Medasha.\n\n1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:11.280\n Yeah. Okay, cool.\n\n1:37:11.280 --> 1:37:15.520\n Anyway, but I read about it in middle of August, August 14th,\n\n1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:17.800\n there was an incident on that test net.\n\n1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:22.040\n How does this process work?\n\n1:37:22.040 --> 1:37:23.880\n What do you learn from those kinds of incidents\n\n1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:26.480\n when stuff goes wrong in the test process?\n\n1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:30.320\n I think that incident was that\n\n1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:33.760\n there was a consensus failure of some kind as I remember.\n\n1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:35.680\n Basically just different clients\n\n1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:37.080\n interpreting things in different ways,\n\n1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:39.360\n and then one of them getting kicked off the network.\n\n1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:41.960\n And then it ended up taking a while\n\n1:37:41.960 --> 1:37:45.320\n to actually get everyone to get back online.\n\n1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:47.760\n A big part of the reason why it took weeks to resolve\n\n1:37:47.760 --> 1:37:50.920\n is because it's on a test network,\n\n1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:52.200\n like the coins are valueless.\n\n1:37:52.200 --> 1:37:55.560\n And so there's not really this big push of any kind\n\n1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:58.560\n for people to actually go and download the new clients\n\n1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:00.480\n so they can start participating again.\n\n1:38:00.480 --> 1:38:02.840\n And so it definitely took a while\n\n1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:05.000\n until the chain started finalizing again.\n\n1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.520\n And then also there was, I think,\n\n1:38:08.520 --> 1:38:12.040\n another round of just not finalizing in October,\n\n1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:12.920\n as I remember.\n\n1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:17.280\n There were definitely things that we learned.\n\n1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:18.720\n Like there were a lot of things,\n\n1:38:18.720 --> 1:38:20.880\n especially that client developers\n\n1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:22.840\n just learned about like optimization\n\n1:38:22.840 --> 1:38:25.800\n and how to build their clients\n\n1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:28.520\n in a way that they can process things efficiently.\n\n1:38:28.520 --> 1:38:30.360\n There's a lot that we learned\n\n1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:32.360\n from just like seeing the full life cycle\n\n1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:34.920\n of what happens when more than a third of the validators\n\n1:38:34.920 --> 1:38:37.000\n go offline and then finalization stops.\n\n1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:42.000\n And then that kind of weird unusual state\n\n1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.520\n of the chain continues for a while.\n\n1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:46.600\n And then eventually everyone who is not participating\n\n1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:48.920\n just gets enough of their stake.\n\n1:38:48.920 --> 1:38:50.680\n Like we don't use the word slashed,\n\n1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:51.920\n we use the word leaked for this,\n\n1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:53.400\n but like basically also burned\n\n1:38:53.400 --> 1:38:56.080\n until the people who are participating\n\n1:38:56.080 --> 1:38:57.080\n go back up to two thirds\n\n1:38:57.080 --> 1:38:59.640\n and then the chain goes back to finalizing.\n\n1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:03.080\n So just seeing all of those edge cases play out live,\n\n1:39:03.080 --> 1:39:04.440\n I think actually helped a lot\n\n1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:05.840\n and probably helped to really contribute\n\n1:39:05.840 --> 1:39:08.960\n to making us feel better about Mainnet.\n\n1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:11.400\n I mean, there's also an incident just recently\n\n1:39:11.400 --> 1:39:15.040\n in April 24th of 2021\n\n1:39:15.040 --> 1:39:18.440\n where this was on Beacon, I guess.\n\n1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:22.680\n There was a bug discovered in the software client Prism\n\n1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:25.480\n that prevented roughly 70% of validators\n\n1:39:25.480 --> 1:39:27.480\n on the network from producing blocks.\n\n1:39:28.560 --> 1:39:30.800\n I mean, maybe you can comment on what happened,\n\n1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.360\n but broadly like the big picture,\n\n1:39:34.360 --> 1:39:36.680\n what kind of stuff are you worried about\n\n1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:39.440\n in terms of problems that might arise?\n\n1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.280\n Are we talking about small bugs?\n\n1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:45.440\n Are we talking about like emergent social,\n\n1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:48.080\n unexpected social bugs?\n\n1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:49.240\n What are the things that worry you\n\n1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:50.640\n about the future of Ethereum\n\n1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.360\n that you want to make sure you construct mechanisms\n\n1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:55.400\n that prevent those things from happening?\n\n1:39:55.400 --> 1:39:57.600\n So one of the lucky things there was\n\n1:39:57.600 --> 1:40:00.160\n that this particular bug only prevented\n\n1:40:00.160 --> 1:40:01.400\n proposed self blocks.\n\n1:40:01.400 --> 1:40:03.400\n It did not prevent attestations.\n\n1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:06.280\n So attestations is just a mechanism for voting on blocks.\n\n1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:08.680\n And it's the attestations that are actually responsible\n\n1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:09.880\n for the chain finalizing.\n\n1:40:09.880 --> 1:40:12.960\n So like coming to this more permanence agreements on blocks.\n\n1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:16.160\n So the chain was actually quite stable all the way through.\n\n1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:21.080\n I think the thing that we generally learned\n\n1:40:21.080 --> 1:40:26.080\n from these experiences is just how valuable it is\n\n1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:28.520\n to have this multi client network.\n\n1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:30.760\n So this is one of these areas where I think Ethereum\n\n1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:33.680\n distinguishes itself from like Bitcoin, for example.\n\n1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:38.400\n That in Ethereum, we don't have one single client\n\n1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:41.640\n that everyone just runs, right?\n\n1:40:41.640 --> 1:40:44.520\n There's multiple implementations of the protocol.\n\n1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:46.120\n And these multiple implementations,\n\n1:40:46.120 --> 1:40:49.440\n they all process and verify the blocks\n\n1:40:49.440 --> 1:40:52.560\n that each other can verify, right?\n\n1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:54.280\n So they all speak the same language.\n\n1:40:54.280 --> 1:40:56.760\n Now, sometimes when there's a bug, they disagree.\n\n1:40:56.760 --> 1:40:59.240\n And when two clients disagree because of a bug,\n\n1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.120\n we call this a consensus failure.\n\n1:41:01.120 --> 1:41:03.200\n And consensus failures are pretty serious, right?\n\n1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:08.200\n And when you have a client's monoculture like Bitcoin does,\n\n1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:12.640\n then it's more rare to have consensus failures.\n\n1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:13.840\n Though you still have them actually.\n\n1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:15.200\n Bitcoin had a consensus failure\n\n1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.240\n between two different versions of the same client\n\n1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:21.880\n back in 2013, but they're less likely to happen.\n\n1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:25.000\n But the interesting thing is that the multi client\n\n1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:28.320\n architecture has actually, I think, saved Ethereum\n\n1:41:28.320 --> 1:41:30.040\n much more than it's heard it.\n\n1:41:30.040 --> 1:41:31.960\n So even in this most recent incident, right?\n\n1:41:31.960 --> 1:41:33.440\n Like Prism was not producing blocks,\n\n1:41:33.440 --> 1:41:36.920\n but all the other clients were still producing blocks.\n\n1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.080\n There's four others, right?\n\n1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:42.080\n Yes, it's a Prism, Nimbus, Teku, and the Lighthouse.\n\n1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:47.320\n And then also Ethereum back in 2016 had this fun events\n\n1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:49.440\n that we call the Shanghai DOS attacks.\n\n1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:52.840\n They're called that because the attacks started\n\n1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:56.960\n right on the first day of our annual conference at DEF CON\n\n1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:59.320\n that happens to be in Shanghai that year.\n\n1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:03.680\n So what happened basically was that someone came up\n\n1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:07.320\n with a way to create blocks that were very slow\n\n1:42:07.320 --> 1:42:10.160\n for one client to process, but not the other client.\n\n1:42:10.160 --> 1:42:12.880\n So at that time, there were basically two Ethereum clients.\n\n1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:15.040\n They were called Geth and Parity.\n\n1:42:15.040 --> 1:42:18.400\n Right now, I think the top three ones are Geth,\n\n1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:20.720\n Nethermind, and Basu.\n\n1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:23.600\n But what happened as a result of us having two clients\n\n1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:26.280\n is that the attacker was just not able to come up\n\n1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:31.280\n with blocks that both clients were completely failing\n\n1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:32.240\n at processing.\n\n1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:35.080\n And so a lot of the miners and a lot of network participants,\n\n1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:37.760\n they just kept on switching between the two implementations\n\n1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:39.040\n depending on which one worked.\n\n1:42:39.040 --> 1:42:44.040\n And that actually really helped the chain survive\n\n1:42:44.880 --> 1:42:47.400\n through that month of attacks as the attacker just kept\n\n1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:50.040\n on hammering at our system and identifying all\n\n1:42:50.040 --> 1:42:53.080\n of the weaknesses and just forcing our clients\n\n1:42:53.080 --> 1:42:56.480\n to do this rapid sprint of just optimizing the hell\n\n1:42:56.480 --> 1:42:58.640\n out of everything and make sure there aren't any\n\n1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:02.520\n of those DOS blocks or DOS bugs remaining.\n\n1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.760\n So that was another example.\n\n1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:07.360\n And then as a counter example,\n\n1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:11.240\n so something that also shows the point from the other side,\n\n1:43:11.240 --> 1:43:15.640\n Bitcoin had this bug in 2010, the balance overflow bug.\n\n1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:20.280\n Basically someone created a transaction that had two outputs\n\n1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:24.720\n and those outputs were both of a few billion Bitcoin.\n\n1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:27.920\n So like about two to the power of 63 Satoshis.\n\n1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:29.440\n And then if you add those numbers together,\n\n1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:31.800\n you'll go above two to the power of 64.\n\n1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:35.000\n And of course, computers like once you go above\n\n1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:36.920\n to the power of 64, you wrap around.\n\n1:43:36.920 --> 1:43:40.680\n And so the Bitcoin nodes thought that there was enough money\n\n1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:42.680\n to pay for the transaction because it was asking for,\n\n1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:44.400\n let's say like a billion Satoshis or something,\n\n1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:46.520\n but actually it was asking for two to the power\n\n1:43:46.520 --> 1:43:48.120\n of 64 plus a billion.\n\n1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:51.400\n And so the attacker just managed to create like billions\n\n1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:53.120\n of Bitcoin out of thin air.\n\n1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:57.320\n And this was not only discovered and fixed\n\n1:43:57.320 --> 1:43:59.800\n after something like 12 hours,\n\n1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:02.360\n but if there had been,\n\n1:44:02.360 --> 1:44:05.040\n if Bitcoin had been a multiple implementation system,\n\n1:44:05.040 --> 1:44:08.160\n then what would have almost certainly happened\n\n1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:10.680\n is like one of the clients would have bugged out,\n\n1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:13.280\n but the other clients would have probably\n\n1:44:13.280 --> 1:44:15.040\n actually had a check for that, right?\n\n1:44:15.040 --> 1:44:17.440\n And so there would have been a consensus failure,\n\n1:44:17.440 --> 1:44:21.440\n but at least that would have like alerted everyone\n\n1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:24.080\n that there is a problem very quickly.\n\n1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:25.680\n And it also would have given everyone\n\n1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:28.440\n just like obvious social permission to go and, you know,\n\n1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:30.480\n pick whichever one of the chains is correct\n\n1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:31.960\n and solve the problem.\n\n1:44:31.960 --> 1:44:36.920\n So like, that's, I think a big learning that we've had\n\n1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:40.240\n from multiple of our experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem,\n\n1:44:40.240 --> 1:44:43.240\n just like validating this multi client model.\n\n1:44:43.240 --> 1:44:44.080\n And like, to be fair,\n\n1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:46.160\n it's a model that we get criticized for a lot, right?\n\n1:44:46.160 --> 1:44:48.280\n Like Bitcoin people talk about, you know,\n\n1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:51.120\n the risk of consensus failures that this creates.\n\n1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:53.160\n VC types are like, well, you know,\n\n1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:55.840\n isn't it expensive and wasteful to fund three software teams\n\n1:44:55.840 --> 1:44:57.080\n where you could just be making, you know,\n\n1:44:57.080 --> 1:44:59.480\n one quote focused effort, you know,\n\n1:44:59.480 --> 1:45:00.640\n they love the word focused.\n\n1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:02.480\n And like, you know, Ethereum is not that,\n\n1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:04.520\n but it's amazing despite not being that.\n\n1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:05.360\n Yeah.\n\n1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:12.600\n Basically, yeah, so that was interesting.\n\n1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:16.680\n And then there have definitely been other learnings as well,\n\n1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.640\n just from like seeing the chain live\n\n1:45:18.640 --> 1:45:23.160\n and seeing what actually is the staking experience like,\n\n1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:24.920\n what are the actual incentives\n\n1:45:24.920 --> 1:45:26.480\n for all the different participants.\n\n1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:28.960\n So I definitely feel like we're gaining a lot\n\n1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:31.920\n from this sort of one year of trial running the chain\n\n1:45:31.920 --> 1:45:34.520\n before we actually make all of Ethereum depend on it.\n\n1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:37.640\n Let me ask perhaps a strange question,\n\n1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:41.320\n but you know, proponents of Bitcoin will say things like,\n\n1:45:41.320 --> 1:45:42.760\n Bitcoin fixes everything.\n\n1:45:44.080 --> 1:45:46.640\n So why do we need Ethereum?\n\n1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:52.880\n Versus like Bitcoin plus lightning network for scalability\n\n1:45:54.520 --> 1:45:56.320\n and then using Bitcoin for,\n\n1:45:56.320 --> 1:45:58.600\n with this proof of work for security.\n\n1:45:58.600 --> 1:46:02.840\n So in this kind of, it is perhaps sort of a strange question,\n\n1:46:02.840 --> 1:46:04.080\n but it's a high level question.\n\n1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:07.360\n Why do we need another technology?\n\n1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:09.560\n Yes, it has a bunch of nice features,\n\n1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:13.120\n but like doesn't Bitcoin fix everything already?\n\n1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:17.280\n So the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin\n\n1:46:17.280 --> 1:46:20.520\n is these values of decentralization,\n\n1:46:20.520 --> 1:46:22.960\n creating these open provisional systems\n\n1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:24.720\n that anyone can participate in\n\n1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:27.200\n and that aren't just going to flop over and die\n\n1:46:27.200 --> 1:46:28.840\n if whoever created them gets bored\n\n1:46:28.840 --> 1:46:33.640\n and that are resistant to like whoever runs them\n\n1:46:33.640 --> 1:46:35.400\n breaking the rules and all of these things.\n\n1:46:35.400 --> 1:46:38.680\n And I think that pretty strongly that these principles\n\n1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:40.640\n are like really valid in importance\n\n1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:42.520\n to much more things than just money, right?\n\n1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:45.040\n Like Bitcoin is the blockchain for money\n\n1:46:45.040 --> 1:46:47.040\n and Ethereum was built from the start\n\n1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:49.720\n as a general purpose blockchain, right?\n\n1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:51.560\n There is ether the asset on Ethereum,\n\n1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:56.040\n but then you can also make decentralized financial things,\n\n1:46:56.040 --> 1:46:58.400\n what we call DeFi today.\n\n1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.400\n You can make like ENS, the decentralized domain name system.\n\n1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:05.000\n You can put, make prediction markets on it.\n\n1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:09.200\n You can make totally nonfinancial systems\n\n1:47:09.200 --> 1:47:11.960\n that just like keep track of whether or not\n\n1:47:11.960 --> 1:47:13.400\n some certificate was signed\n\n1:47:13.400 --> 1:47:16.720\n or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked.\n\n1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:21.280\n There's this big long list of like just interesting things\n\n1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:23.440\n that you could use about blockchains to do, right?\n\n1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:26.480\n Like basically they are sort of the missing piece\n\n1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:29.320\n that where without them,\n\n1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:31.600\n the kinds of things that a decentralized computer network\n\n1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:32.760\n can do is very limited.\n\n1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:33.600\n And once you have them,\n\n1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:36.440\n a lot of those limitations end up going away.\n\n1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:41.440\n And so Ethereum was like always from the beginning\n\n1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:43.040\n about that, right?\n\n1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:45.160\n It's about like, hey, this isn't just money.\n\n1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:48.200\n There's so much more that you could do\n\n1:47:48.200 --> 1:47:51.560\n if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure\n\n1:47:51.560 --> 1:47:54.080\n or digital institution or DAO\n\n1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:55.560\n or whatever you wanna call it,\n\n1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:58.640\n where the kind of the base layer of the logic\n\n1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:00.920\n is just executed in this open and transparent way\n\n1:48:00.920 --> 1:48:03.400\n where everyone can see what's going on\n\n1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:05.360\n or if you like your zero knowledge proofs,\n\n1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:07.360\n at least everyone can see proofs that prove to you\n\n1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:09.560\n that what's going on follows the rules\n\n1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:13.640\n and you don't need to just constantly keep trusting\n\n1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:14.800\n centralized actors.\n\n1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:18.120\n Hence the smart contracts\n\n1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:21.520\n as being a sort of a core technology as part of Ethereum.\n\n1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:22.360\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:48:22.360 --> 1:48:24.760\n Smart contracts, the computer programs\n\n1:48:24.760 --> 1:48:25.840\n that are running on Ethereum,\n\n1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:26.960\n they are like the core\n\n1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:29.080\n of what makes Ethereum general purpose.\n\n1:48:29.080 --> 1:48:34.080\n Yeah, so I do think that there's a lot more wrong\n\n1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:37.360\n with the world than just money, right?\n\n1:48:37.360 --> 1:48:40.080\n Like I'm not one of these people who thinks that\n\n1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:42.160\n if you get rid of fiat currency\n\n1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:43.560\n and you replace it with cryptocurrency,\n\n1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:45.440\n then suddenly wars are gonna go away, right?\n\n1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:48.080\n Because like, first of all,\n\n1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:49.120\n like say your average revenue\n\n1:48:49.120 --> 1:48:51.480\n is only a small portion of government revenue, right?\n\n1:48:51.480 --> 1:48:54.400\n It's like what, 5%, 10%, something like that.\n\n1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:58.920\n Second of all, like if you are the sort of,\n\n1:48:58.920 --> 1:48:59.760\n this is one of the things\n\n1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:01.000\n I don't even get about their philosophy.\n\n1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:02.840\n Like, let's say you're the sort of person\n\n1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:06.600\n who is an extreme and very distrusting libertarian\n\n1:49:06.600 --> 1:49:09.320\n and you think that these governments are terrible, right?\n\n1:49:09.320 --> 1:49:11.440\n Like we know today that governments\n\n1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:15.080\n find a combination of things like welfare\n\n1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:17.520\n and things like the military\n\n1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:21.000\n that goes and like bombs people in Afghanistan, right?\n\n1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:24.240\n And so the question you have to ask is like, okay,\n\n1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:29.240\n you with your new, you know, magic newfangled cyber currency\n\n1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.160\n that takes over the world,\n\n1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:33.560\n take away the government's ability\n\n1:49:33.560 --> 1:49:34.960\n to have seniorized revenue\n\n1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:37.760\n and so you reduce the government's revenue by 10%.\n\n1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:39.440\n If the government is that evil,\n\n1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:41.720\n which portion of its expenses\n\n1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:43.680\n is it gonna take that 10% from?\n\n1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:45.840\n Is it gonna stop the bombing people in Afghanistan\n\n1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:47.680\n or is it gonna cut welfare?\n\n1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:48.640\n If you think it's the first,\n\n1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:51.560\n you have a very optimistic view of the government, right?\n\n1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:55.920\n So that's, I guess, my perspective\n\n1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:58.480\n on like why the whole, you know,\n\n1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:02.840\n we're going to save the world and create peace\n\n1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:04.760\n by like denying governments the right\n\n1:50:04.760 --> 1:50:07.680\n to stealth taxation kind of perspective\n\n1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:09.520\n doesn't really make much sense for me.\n\n1:50:09.520 --> 1:50:11.200\n And I do think that there is real value\n\n1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:14.920\n that comes from a decentralized and open currency.\n\n1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:18.320\n Like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure\n\n1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:21.680\n that anyone in the world can go ahead and use, right?\n\n1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:24.600\n It's, that's something that can easily be\n\n1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:25.680\n a big boon for people, right?\n\n1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.840\n There's a lot of places where the currency\n\n1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:32.640\n and is much less stable than the dollar.\n\n1:50:32.640 --> 1:50:35.880\n And, you know, these people like they don't like,\n\n1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:37.520\n well, if they use Bitcoin,\n\n1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.240\n their only option is to get Bitcoins, right?\n\n1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:42.120\n Which, you know, are also pretty volatile.\n\n1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:44.280\n If they use Ethereum, then, you know, they can get ether,\n\n1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:46.000\n but then they can also get stable coins, right?\n\n1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:47.800\n And you might think that, you know,\n\n1:50:47.800 --> 1:50:49.840\n oh, you're not being ideologically pure.\n\n1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.160\n Now you're giving them stable coins,\n\n1:50:51.160 --> 1:50:52.360\n which are mirroring dollars.\n\n1:50:52.360 --> 1:50:54.320\n And obviously dollars are going to collapse too.\n\n1:50:54.320 --> 1:50:56.720\n But the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable\n\n1:50:56.720 --> 1:50:58.440\n than the Venezuelan Bolivar.\n\n1:50:58.440 --> 1:51:03.440\n So like, there are really meaningful and beneficial things\n\n1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:07.800\n that you can give to people by having a global\n\n1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:09.080\n and open financial system.\n\n1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:11.680\n But I think if you want to actually do that,\n\n1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:14.120\n like you have to have much more than just a currency, right?\n\n1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:16.280\n And then if you want to go beyond financial things,\n\n1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:19.880\n then, you know, you have to obviously have much more\n\n1:51:19.880 --> 1:51:21.680\n than a currency and then, you know,\n\n1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:24.960\n you also have to actually take scalability seriously\n\n1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:26.640\n because the nonfinancial applications,\n\n1:51:26.640 --> 1:51:29.240\n like nobody's going to pay $5 a transaction for them.\n\n1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:33.840\n Can we return to dogs?\n\n1:51:33.840 --> 1:51:34.680\n Sure.\n\n1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:35.520\n Woof, woof.\n\n1:51:35.520 --> 1:51:40.200\n No, no, no, no, no.\n\n1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:41.840\n The other one's categorically forbidden.\n\n1:51:41.840 --> 1:51:43.320\n Yeah, categorically forbidden.\n\n1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:45.960\n Is there any cryptocurrency based on cats actually?\n\n1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:46.880\n I think there are.\n\n1:51:46.880 --> 1:51:49.600\n Like, there was cat coin, there was nan coin.\n\n1:51:49.600 --> 1:51:51.600\n For some reason, they just didn't catch on as much\n\n1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:53.160\n as the dog coins did.\n\n1:51:53.160 --> 1:51:56.360\n Okay, so let's talk about Dogecoin and Elon Musk.\n\n1:51:57.840 --> 1:52:01.480\n Elon said that, quote, ideally,\n\n1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:04.680\n Doge speeds up block time 10x,\n\n1:52:04.680 --> 1:52:09.680\n increases block size 10x, and drops fee 100x.\n\n1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:14.160\n Then it wins hands down, end quote.\n\n1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:18.320\n You said in a blog post, partially responding to that,\n\n1:52:18.320 --> 1:52:20.600\n that there are subtle technical reasons\n\n1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.120\n why this is not possible.\n\n1:52:23.800 --> 1:52:28.800\n To this, Elon said that you, quote, fear the Doge.\n\n1:52:30.400 --> 1:52:31.600\n So let's talk about this.\n\n1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:34.600\n What are the technical hurdles for Dogecoin\n\n1:52:34.600 --> 1:52:35.920\n that prevent it from becoming\n\n1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:38.880\n one of the primary cryptocurrencies of the world?\n\n1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:41.320\n And do you, in fact, fear the Doge?\n\n1:52:41.320 --> 1:52:43.640\n I definitely feel obligated to correct the record.\n\n1:52:43.640 --> 1:52:45.440\n I definitely do not fear the Doge.\n\n1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:46.280\n Okay.\n\n1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:47.200\n No, I love the Doge.\n\n1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:50.600\n I actually visited the Doge in Japan a few years back.\n\n1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:54.000\n She's an amazing dog, she's still alive.\n\n1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:55.160\n Wait, the original Doge?\n\n1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:56.000\n Yeah.\n\n1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:56.840\n Oh, wow.\n\n1:52:58.480 --> 1:53:02.920\n So, you know, we accept Doge every year\n\n1:53:02.920 --> 1:53:05.640\n for our annual DEF CON conferences.\n\n1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:09.280\n So, I definitely don't think Ethereum\n\n1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:11.480\n is opposed to Doge coins.\n\n1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:13.760\n I kind of want to feel like Ethereum\n\n1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:16.000\n is at least a little bit in spirit itself a Dogecoin.\n\n1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.920\n And then, as I mentioned, I love Doge,\n\n1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:22.520\n I bought a bunch of Doge, I still hold a bunch of Doge.\n\n1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.560\n On the scalability question,\n\n1:53:25.560 --> 1:53:29.760\n the challenge basically is the limits to scalability\n\n1:53:29.760 --> 1:53:31.920\n and the trade offs with centralization, right?\n\n1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:33.920\n If you just increase the parameters\n\n1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:34.760\n without doing anything else,\n\n1:53:34.760 --> 1:53:37.280\n then it just becomes more and more difficult\n\n1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:38.640\n for people to validate the chain\n\n1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:41.960\n and it just becomes more likely that the chain\n\n1:53:41.960 --> 1:53:44.320\n becomes centralized and becomes vulnerable\n\n1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:45.960\n to all kinds of capture.\n\n1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:48.800\n So, does it need like some of the layer two technologies\n\n1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:50.960\n that we've been talking about?\n\n1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:55.080\n I personally think that if Doge wants to somehow bridge\n\n1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:57.400\n through Ethereum and then people can trade Doge\n\n1:53:57.400 --> 1:53:59.760\n thousands of times a second inside of a loop ring,\n\n1:53:59.760 --> 1:54:01.640\n then that would be amazing.\n\n1:54:01.640 --> 1:54:05.280\n If they want to just like take ZK roll up style technology\n\n1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:07.520\n and just have thousands of transactions a second\n\n1:54:07.520 --> 1:54:10.800\n on their own chain, then that would be a great outcome\n\n1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:11.640\n as well.\n\n1:54:11.640 --> 1:54:15.160\n So, is there ways for Ethereum and Dogecoin\n\n1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:16.880\n to work together?\n\n1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:21.880\n Okay, so there's a power behind a person like Elon Musk\n\n1:54:22.040 --> 1:54:24.200\n pushing the development of a cryptocurrency.\n\n1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:30.000\n Is there ways to leverage that power and that momentum\n\n1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.480\n to improve Ethereum, to improve some of the sort of\n\n1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:38.120\n cryptocurrencies that are already technologically advanced\n\n1:54:38.120 --> 1:54:40.480\n and pushing forward that kind of technology?\n\n1:54:41.440 --> 1:54:45.320\n I definitely think there's room for...\n\n1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:48.840\n You know that meme of Doge like taking over,\n\n1:54:48.840 --> 1:54:49.880\n like that storm?\n\n1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:50.720\n I've seen it.\n\n1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:55.720\n Is there a way to ride that storm, that wave of the Doge\n\n1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:57.200\n that's taking over?\n\n1:54:57.200 --> 1:55:00.360\n I think if we can have a secure Doge to Ethereum bridge,\n\n1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:02.040\n then that would be amazing.\n\n1:55:02.040 --> 1:55:04.400\n And then when Ethereum gets its scalability,\n\n1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:07.600\n any scalability thing that works for Ethereum assets,\n\n1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:10.400\n you would be able to also trade wrapped Doge\n\n1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:11.880\n with extremely low transaction fees\n\n1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:13.320\n and very high speed as well.\n\n1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:16.640\n Is there precedence for building secure bridges\n\n1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:18.520\n between cryptocurrencies?\n\n1:55:18.520 --> 1:55:21.240\n Is that, I mean, how difficult is this kind of task?\n\n1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:23.960\n It's definitely something that's in its infancy.\n\n1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:26.480\n There definitely have been some cross chain interaction\n\n1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:28.200\n things that have been done before.\n\n1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.920\n So, the earliest is probably the concept of merge mining,\n\n1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:34.200\n right, when a chain just makes its entire\n\n1:55:34.200 --> 1:55:36.480\n proof of work algorithm dependent on\n\n1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:38.960\n the proof of work algorithm of another chain.\n\n1:55:38.960 --> 1:55:41.840\n So, I think famous Dogecoin actually merge mines\n\n1:55:41.840 --> 1:55:44.160\n to Litecoin, which is, I think in retrospect,\n\n1:55:44.160 --> 1:55:45.560\n not looking like a very good choice\n\n1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:47.760\n because now Dogecoin is bigger than Litecoin.\n\n1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:53.480\n But, you know, if there's potentially some way\n\n1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:57.680\n for Dogecoin to merge mine with an Ethereum proof\n\n1:55:57.680 --> 1:55:59.080\n of stake of some kinds,\n\n1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:01.560\n then that could be an interesting alternative.\n\n1:56:04.200 --> 1:56:06.600\n So, that's one type of chain interaction.\n\n1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:09.640\n As far as bridges, like one chain reading another chain,\n\n1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:10.920\n early in Ethereum's history,\n\n1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:13.000\n there was this project called BTC Relay.\n\n1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:14.640\n It's a smart contract on Ethereum\n\n1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:17.000\n that just verifies Bitcoin blocks.\n\n1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:20.160\n I think people stopped really caring about it\n\n1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:22.320\n and maintaining it because there just weren't enough\n\n1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:24.720\n applications that were actually interested\n\n1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:25.720\n in using it at the time.\n\n1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:27.560\n And then the transaction fees got too high\n\n1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:28.920\n to actually maintain it.\n\n1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:33.360\n So, I think if we want to make a BTC Relay 2.0,\n\n1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:35.520\n that becomes cheaper because, you know,\n\n1:56:35.520 --> 1:56:37.040\n it uses snarks or something like that,\n\n1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:38.200\n then you probably could.\n\n1:56:38.200 --> 1:56:42.040\n But maybe now's the time when you actually\n\n1:56:42.040 --> 1:56:44.360\n can do that sort of one way verification.\n\n1:56:44.360 --> 1:56:45.440\n But the one challenge though,\n\n1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:47.760\n is that if he wants to have a bridge\n\n1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:49.920\n that allows you to move assets between chains,\n\n1:56:49.920 --> 1:56:52.000\n then you don't just need one way verification,\n\n1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.920\n you need two way verification, right?\n\n1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:55.400\n And Ethereum can verify anything\n\n1:56:55.400 --> 1:56:57.000\n because Ethereum smart contracts\n\n1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:58.760\n can just run arbitrary code.\n\n1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:02.040\n But if you want Bitcoin to be able to do things\n\n1:57:02.040 --> 1:57:03.800\n based on what happens in Ethereum lands,\n\n1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:06.200\n then Bitcoin would have to basically,\n\n1:57:06.200 --> 1:57:07.760\n well, they can do everything with soft forks\n\n1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:10.000\n because that's their religion,\n\n1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.560\n but they'll do it that way.\n\n1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.120\n And if Doge wants to make a fork\n\n1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:19.840\n where that allows for two way transferability\n\n1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:22.000\n with Ethereum, then they could.\n\n1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.640\n I mean, I think that would be a lovely collaboration\n\n1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:27.200\n to make if there's interest.\n\n1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:30.800\n I think there might actually even be some multi SIG funds\n\n1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:33.360\n that has some funding.\n\n1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:35.560\n It's just a bounty for someone\n\n1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:37.280\n to make a bridge between the two.\n\n1:57:37.280 --> 1:57:40.960\n Oh, could you maybe try to psychoanalyze Elon Musk\n\n1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:42.520\n for a brief second?\n\n1:57:42.520 --> 1:57:47.240\n So what are your thoughts about Tesla and Elon Musk's\n\n1:57:47.240 --> 1:57:49.880\n journey through the cryptocurrency world?\n\n1:57:49.880 --> 1:57:53.040\n So first with Bitcoin and then with Dogecoin.\n\n1:57:53.040 --> 1:57:57.400\n So acquiring, holding a large amount of Bitcoin.\n\n1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:01.440\n And I believe, at least considering the acquiring\n\n1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:03.640\n and holding a large amount of Dogecoin.\n\n1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:06.480\n Positives, negatives, what do you think the future\n\n1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.040\n for Tesla and SpaceX in the cryptocurrency space looks like?\n\n1:58:10.040 --> 1:58:12.040\n Do you think they'll consider Ethereum?\n\n1:58:13.120 --> 1:58:17.640\n I'm sure that if they stay in the cryptocurrency system\n\n1:58:17.640 --> 1:58:19.480\n at all, then they have to at some point.\n\n1:58:19.480 --> 1:58:24.480\n Bitcoin number one, Dogecoin number,\n\n1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.440\n I mean, come on, it deserves to be number three.\n\n1:58:29.440 --> 1:58:31.280\n And then, or number two.\n\n1:58:31.280 --> 1:58:34.600\n And then Ethereum can be whatever that other number is.\n\n1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:42.680\n If Ethereum only becomes a Dogecoin somehow,\n\n1:58:42.680 --> 1:58:46.440\n maybe change the logo to incorporate a dog of some sort.\n\n1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:50.320\n Almost like Doge sneaking behind.\n\n1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:52.200\n Oh, that would be fascinating.\n\n1:58:52.200 --> 1:58:53.120\n For when the merge happens.\n\n1:58:53.120 --> 1:58:56.480\n And I think, Elon, you definitely,\n\n1:58:56.480 --> 1:58:58.160\n I think you would make a mistake\n\n1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:02.280\n if you were to kind of ascribe too much sophisticated,\n\n1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:07.280\n malevolent, or any deep intentionality to the whole process.\n\n1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:10.160\n I think he's just a human being and he likes dogs,\n\n1:59:10.160 --> 1:59:11.280\n just like I like dogs.\n\n1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:14.120\n Yeah, I think that is literally the reasoning\n\n1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:16.240\n behind the whole Dogecoin thing.\n\n1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:18.400\n There is some aspect to which,\n\n1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:23.400\n I mean, the guy helped launch a car into space, right?\n\n1:59:24.240 --> 1:59:27.560\n Like you could ask, like, what is the purpose of that?\n\n1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:30.400\n I think the purpose of that is fun.\n\n1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:35.160\n I think he truly is more and more, especially lately,\n\n1:59:35.160 --> 1:59:39.760\n embodying the whole idea that the most entertaining outcome\n\n1:59:39.760 --> 1:59:42.320\n is the most likely and he's fully embracing\n\n1:59:42.320 --> 1:59:44.040\n the most entertaining outcome.\n\n1:59:44.040 --> 1:59:46.240\n And in many ways, Dogecoin is the most\n\n1:59:46.240 --> 1:59:48.320\n entertaining cryptocurrency.\n\n1:59:48.320 --> 1:59:50.840\n As cryptocurrency becomes more and more impactful\n\n1:59:50.840 --> 1:59:52.520\n in the world, people are getting\n\n1:59:52.520 --> 1:59:53.920\n more and more serious about it.\n\n1:59:53.920 --> 1:59:56.000\n And so he's selecting the cryptocurrency\n\n1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:59.280\n that is the least serious and the most fun.\n\n1:59:59.280 --> 2:00:01.520\n And there's something to that,\n\n2:00:01.520 --> 2:00:05.720\n like coupling fun with technological sophistication\n\n2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:10.360\n and somehow figuring out a way to do that well.\n\n2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:12.400\n I want the world to be fun.\n\n2:00:12.400 --> 2:00:14.240\n I think the world being fun is great.\n\n2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:17.840\n Okay, let me ask about a couple\n\n2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:19.680\n of other technologies if it's okay.\n\n2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:20.520\n Sure.\n\n2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:22.720\n What are your thoughts about Chainlink\n\n2:00:22.720 --> 2:00:24.800\n and hybrid smart contracts that utilize\n\n2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:26.920\n off chain external data sources?\n\n2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:32.480\n And I think it's definitely necessary for a smart contract\n\n2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:35.920\n so that do a lot of things to use off chain data\n\n2:00:35.920 --> 2:00:36.760\n of some kind, right?\n\n2:00:36.760 --> 2:00:38.520\n Like if you want to have a stable coin,\n\n2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:39.880\n you need a price oracle so you know\n\n2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:41.440\n what price you're targeting.\n\n2:00:41.440 --> 2:00:45.560\n If you want to have some fancy no crop insurance gadget,\n\n2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:47.960\n like I think EtherRisk has been doing\n\n2:00:47.960 --> 2:00:49.840\n a lot of good work with that.\n\n2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:53.280\n And I think it was either Kenya or Sri Lanka or both,\n\n2:00:53.280 --> 2:00:56.800\n like they're making a lot of good progress\n\n2:00:56.800 --> 2:00:59.200\n in some of those places.\n\n2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:01.840\n Like you need some kind of oracle to tell you,\n\n2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:04.200\n did it actually rain in this particular area?\n\n2:01:05.200 --> 2:01:07.280\n If he wants to have like assets that mirror\n\n2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:09.320\n other financial assets, you need an oracle.\n\n2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:10.600\n If you want to have a prediction market,\n\n2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:12.040\n you need an oracle.\n\n2:01:12.040 --> 2:01:15.480\n And so projects that provide oracles\n\n2:01:15.480 --> 2:01:18.320\n are definitely really important.\n\n2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:20.400\n There are definitely different kinds of use cases.\n\n2:01:20.400 --> 2:01:22.400\n Like Augur is more about events\n\n2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:24.640\n and the Augur oracle is designed,\n\n2:01:24.640 --> 2:01:26.120\n I think differently from Chainlink, right?\n\n2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:29.160\n Like Chainlink emphasizes the whole,\n\n2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:31.640\n we have a fast automated thing\n\n2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:33.760\n that just gives you data quickly.\n\n2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:37.320\n Whereas Augur is more, we don't give a crap about speed.\n\n2:01:38.200 --> 2:01:40.000\n And look, we don't need to give a crap about speed\n\n2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:41.440\n because if you want to get your money out\n\n2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:44.320\n on a prediction market that where in reality it's resolved,\n\n2:01:44.320 --> 2:01:47.120\n you can probably just sell your coins for 99 cents anyway.\n\n2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:52.360\n So I mean, I think Chainlink is definitely\n\n2:01:52.360 --> 2:01:57.360\n taking a good and important part of the oracle design space.\n\n2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:00.960\n And I'm definitely happy that there's\n\n2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:02.720\n that project taking the task on.\n\n2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:04.840\n I mean, at the same time, I do think that\n\n2:02:04.840 --> 2:02:07.240\n their frog army on Twitter can get a bit intense at times,\n\n2:02:07.240 --> 2:02:08.080\n but like.\n\n2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:10.560\n I mean, is there a way to incorporate\n\n2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:14.480\n sort of oracle network type of ideas into Ethereum?\n\n2:02:14.480 --> 2:02:17.920\n I personally would prefer the Ethereum base layer,\n\n2:02:17.920 --> 2:02:21.920\n like stay away from trying to provide too much functionality\n\n2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:25.960\n because like once you have the Ethereum base layer\n\n2:02:25.960 --> 2:02:29.560\n making a claim about like say the US dollar\n\n2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:33.280\n to Ethereum price, like at some sense,\n\n2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:35.000\n you're basically saying that like Ethereum\n\n2:02:35.000 --> 2:02:38.440\n as a base platform starts making\n\n2:02:38.440 --> 2:02:40.560\n what could be geopolitical statements, right?\n\n2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:44.400\n Like for example, imagine if there was some civil war\n\n2:02:44.400 --> 2:02:46.440\n and the US split up and you had two currencies\n\n2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:47.920\n that both claims to be the US dollar,\n\n2:02:47.920 --> 2:02:50.920\n well, Ethereum would have to pick one\n\n2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:53.040\n for the sake of everyone who was already using that oracle.\n\n2:02:53.040 --> 2:02:56.040\n So does that mean that the blockchain would be\n\n2:02:56.040 --> 2:02:59.400\n taking a position in this big mega political debate?\n\n2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:03.600\n So I think like for just those kinds of reasons,\n\n2:03:03.600 --> 2:03:08.240\n I would personally like prefer Ethereum itself\n\n2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:11.400\n to be more of this sort of pure platform\n\n2:03:11.400 --> 2:03:13.840\n that just analyzes transactions\n\n2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:17.920\n just mathematically using deterministic consensus rules.\n\n2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:20.360\n And then if you need the oracles, that can be layer twos.\n\n2:03:20.360 --> 2:03:23.600\n Like I think Ethereum like benefits\n\n2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:26.320\n from not trying to do everything at layer one\n\n2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:29.320\n and having this like very robust layer two ecosystem\n\n2:03:29.320 --> 2:03:31.400\n where you have all these projects doing interesting things.\n\n2:03:31.400 --> 2:03:34.040\n Yeah, focus on the basic technology avoid the politics.\n\n2:03:34.040 --> 2:03:34.880\n Gotcha.\n\n2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:37.980\n Let me ask a bit of a human question.\n\n2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:43.800\n Charles Hoskinson, someone you've worked with\n\n2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:46.000\n in the early days of Ethereum,\n\n2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.840\n there appears to my outsider view\n\n2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:51.080\n to have been a bit of a falling out.\n\n2:03:51.080 --> 2:03:54.020\n Is there positive inspiring human story\n\n2:03:54.020 --> 2:03:56.640\n to be told about why you two parted ways?\n\n2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:01.640\n I kind of want to let the various books\n\n2:04:01.760 --> 2:04:04.280\n about Ethereum speak for themselves,\n\n2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:09.240\n but I feel like since that time,\n\n2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:13.240\n I think Charles has clearly progressed\n\n2:04:14.720 --> 2:04:16.880\n and matured in a lot of ways.\n\n2:04:16.880 --> 2:04:19.720\n And people who follow Charles closely\n\n2:04:19.720 --> 2:04:22.280\n have definitely told me that like 2021 Charles\n\n2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:24.080\n is very different from a 2014 Charles.\n\n2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:26.520\n And I'm sure it's 2021 Vitalik is much different\n\n2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:28.520\n from 2014 Vitalik as well.\n\n2:04:28.520 --> 2:04:32.400\n I'm kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 Vitalik\n\n2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.060\n and Charles look like as well.\n\n2:04:34.060 --> 2:04:35.360\n Oh, interesting.\n\n2:04:35.360 --> 2:04:37.400\n Like the progression of the humans.\n\n2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:39.140\n Is this going to be one of those things\n\n2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:40.720\n where like everyone comes full circle\n\n2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:43.240\n and then 2030 Vitalik and Charles are best friends?\n\n2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:45.600\n Yeah, not necessarily best friends,\n\n2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:50.600\n but some kind of are able to reminisce\n\n2:04:50.600 --> 2:04:55.480\n in ways that puts some of the tension of the past behind.\n\n2:04:55.480 --> 2:04:57.440\n I think such things are possible.\n\n2:04:58.400 --> 2:05:02.840\n I think people definitely absolutely have a right to,\n\n2:05:02.840 --> 2:05:06.200\n and I think should strive to just constantly change\n\n2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:07.400\n and reinvent themselves.\n\n2:05:08.880 --> 2:05:11.080\n Is there something you could say about your thoughts\n\n2:05:11.080 --> 2:05:15.520\n about the Cardano project that Charles Hoskinson leads?\n\n2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:19.200\n They've worked on some interesting ideas\n\n2:05:19.200 --> 2:05:22.680\n that mirror some of the ideas in Ethereum,\n\n2:05:22.680 --> 2:05:27.680\n proof of stake, working on smart contracts\n\n2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:28.880\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.440\n Is there something, again, positive,\n\n2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:33.160\n inspiring that you could say?\n\n2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:34.360\n Are they a competitor?\n\n2:05:34.360 --> 2:05:36.300\n Is it complimentary technology?\n\n2:05:37.880 --> 2:05:40.080\n There's definitely interesting ideas in there.\n\n2:05:40.080 --> 2:05:43.080\n I do think Cardano takes a bit of a different approach\n\n2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:45.600\n than Ethereum in that they really emphasize\n\n2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:48.800\n having these big academic proofs for everything,\n\n2:05:48.800 --> 2:05:53.040\n whereas Ethereum tends to be more okay with heuristic arguments\n\n2:05:53.040 --> 2:05:55.960\n in part because it's just trying to do more faster.\n\n2:05:55.960 --> 2:05:59.680\n But there's definitely very interesting things\n\n2:05:59.680 --> 2:06:02.440\n that come out of IOHK research.\n\n2:06:03.760 --> 2:06:05.400\n Can you comment on that kind of idea?\n\n2:06:05.400 --> 2:06:08.840\n I, as sort of having a foot in research,\n\n2:06:08.840 --> 2:06:12.120\n enjoy Charles's kind of emphasis on papers\n\n2:06:12.120 --> 2:06:15.160\n and deep academic rigor.\n\n2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:18.760\n What's the role of deep research rigor\n\n2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:20.520\n in the world of cryptocurrency?\n\n2:06:20.520 --> 2:06:21.360\n Interesting.\n\n2:06:21.360 --> 2:06:22.180\n I'm actually the sort of person\n\n2:06:22.180 --> 2:06:23.880\n who thinks deep rigor is overrated.\n\n2:06:25.160 --> 2:06:27.320\n The reason why I think deep rigor is overrated\n\n2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:32.320\n is because I think in terms of why protocols fail,\n\n2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:37.000\n I think the number of failures that are outside the model\n\n2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:39.320\n is even more important, is bigger and more important\n\n2:06:39.320 --> 2:06:41.760\n than the failures that are inside the model.\n\n2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:43.880\n So if you take selfish mining, for example,\n\n2:06:43.880 --> 2:06:47.480\n that original discovery from 2013\n\n2:06:47.480 --> 2:06:52.480\n that showed how Bitcoin does,\n\n2:06:53.360 --> 2:06:56.200\n even if it has a 50% fault tolerance,\n\n2:06:56.200 --> 2:06:57.280\n assuming everyone's honest,\n\n2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:01.260\n it only has a zero to 33% fault tolerance,\n\n2:07:01.260 --> 2:07:02.800\n depending on your network model,\n\n2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:05.180\n if you assume rational actors.\n\n2:07:05.180 --> 2:07:08.520\n And to me, that was a great example\n\n2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:10.200\n of an outside the model failure, right?\n\n2:07:10.200 --> 2:07:12.440\n Because traditional consensus research,\n\n2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:16.020\n just up until or before the blockchain days,\n\n2:07:16.020 --> 2:07:19.440\n did not think about like incentivization much, right?\n\n2:07:19.440 --> 2:07:21.640\n There was a little bit of thought about incentivization.\n\n2:07:21.640 --> 2:07:23.360\n There's like a couple of papers\n\n2:07:23.360 --> 2:07:25.220\n on the Byzantine altruist rational model,\n\n2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:26.860\n but it wasn't that deep.\n\n2:07:26.860 --> 2:07:28.840\n It was mostly operating under the assumption\n\n2:07:28.840 --> 2:07:31.480\n that we're gonna make consensus\n\n2:07:31.480 --> 2:07:34.620\n between 15 participants and these are institutions.\n\n2:07:34.620 --> 2:07:36.280\n And if something goes wrong,\n\n2:07:36.280 --> 2:07:38.840\n then we can figure out whether or not\n\n2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:40.000\n it was deliberate offline.\n\n2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.120\n And if they did something evil, we can sue them.\n\n2:07:42.120 --> 2:07:44.400\n Whereas in the crypto world, you can't sue that, right?\n\n2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:47.720\n And so that whole discovery basically arose\n\n2:07:47.720 --> 2:07:52.720\n just because the model of traditional consensus research\n\n2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:54.840\n just didn't cover those possibilities.\n\n2:07:54.840 --> 2:07:56.600\n And then once you go out of the model,\n\n2:07:56.600 --> 2:07:59.080\n those other issues do exist, right?\n\n2:07:59.080 --> 2:08:01.600\n So, but then at the same time,\n\n2:08:01.600 --> 2:08:04.940\n there definitely are protocols that turn out to be,\n\n2:08:06.140 --> 2:08:08.160\n that do have failures inside the model.\n\n2:08:08.160 --> 2:08:09.780\n Like this reminds me of the time\n\n2:08:09.780 --> 2:08:12.800\n when I think I found a bug\n\n2:08:12.800 --> 2:08:16.160\n in a proposed consensus implementation\n\n2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:18.240\n from either BitShares or EOS.\n\n2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:20.160\n This happened around the end of 2017.\n\n2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:23.440\n So that was definitely inside the model\n\n2:08:23.440 --> 2:08:25.480\n because like they had a very clear idea\n\n2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:26.400\n of what they were trying to achieve.\n\n2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:27.960\n They had a very clear description\n\n2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:30.840\n and like there's a very clear mathematical argument\n\n2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:32.080\n for why the description doesn't lead\n\n2:08:32.080 --> 2:08:33.060\n to what they're trying to achieve.\n\n2:08:33.060 --> 2:08:35.420\n But ultimately what you're trying to achieve\n\n2:08:35.420 --> 2:08:38.380\n can never be fully described in formal language, right?\n\n2:08:38.380 --> 2:08:41.480\n Like I think this is the big discovery of,\n\n2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:43.480\n the AI safety people, for example, right?\n\n2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:48.080\n Like just having a specification of what you want\n\n2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:49.800\n is an insanely hard problem.\n\n2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:52.780\n And like the more powerful the optimizer\n\n2:08:52.780 --> 2:08:54.240\n that you're giving the instructions to,\n\n2:08:54.240 --> 2:08:55.800\n the more you have to be careful.\n\n2:08:55.800 --> 2:09:00.800\n And so, I think there are the kind of these two sides.\n\n2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:05.800\n And then the other thing is that\n\n2:09:05.800 --> 2:09:09.260\n a lot of the academic approach ends up\n\n2:09:09.260 --> 2:09:11.140\n basically optimizing for other people\n\n2:09:11.140 --> 2:09:12.960\n inside of the academic system.\n\n2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:17.840\n And it doesn't really optimize for like curious outsiders.\n\n2:09:17.840 --> 2:09:20.020\n Whereas like I personally totally optimize\n\n2:09:20.020 --> 2:09:23.200\n for curious outsiders, or at least I feel like I strive to.\n\n2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:28.200\n So I guess like that's my case for why I like\n\n2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:31.480\n tends to behave in ways that, you know,\n\n2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:33.400\n occasionally traditional academic types\n\n2:09:33.400 --> 2:09:35.220\n criticize as being reckless.\n\n2:09:35.220 --> 2:09:37.820\n But I mean, on the other hand, you know,\n\n2:09:37.820 --> 2:09:41.680\n there's definitely real benefits that come from\n\n2:09:41.680 --> 2:09:46.400\n like just taking a rigorous approach,\n\n2:09:46.400 --> 2:09:49.600\n especially when, you know, you know what the thing,\n\n2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:51.760\n like, you know what the specification is\n\n2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:53.160\n of what you're trying to get.\n\n2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:56.520\n And like, you're trying to kind of improve your ways\n\n2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:58.760\n or provide protocols that actually provide that.\n\n2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:00.840\n And like, you know exactly what you're looking for.\n\n2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:04.320\n I feel like realistically, you probably wants to do\n\n2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:06.040\n both kinds of analysis.\n\n2:10:06.040 --> 2:10:07.280\n And like, sometimes you even want to do\n\n2:10:07.280 --> 2:10:09.060\n both kinds of analysis in stages, right?\n\n2:10:09.060 --> 2:10:11.760\n Like you have, you want to do more quick and dirty things\n\n2:10:11.760 --> 2:10:14.200\n and even wants public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff.\n\n2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:16.200\n And then later on you formalize it more\n\n2:10:16.200 --> 2:10:17.700\n and then you get more feedback.\n\n2:10:18.660 --> 2:10:23.580\n Like in general, I guess I feel like the norms of research\n\n2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:27.680\n in the future, like the internet has just changed so much.\n\n2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:29.000\n There's no way that it's not going.\n\n2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:32.720\n And you know, it's even changed like collaboration structures\n\n2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:35.520\n and like the patterns in which we work with each other.\n\n2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:38.260\n There's no way that the correct structure\n\n2:10:38.260 --> 2:10:40.760\n for collaborative research is the same\n\n2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:42.120\n as what it was 15 years ago.\n\n2:10:42.120 --> 2:10:46.500\n But like, what combination of these existing components\n\n2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:48.680\n and of new ideas it is, like that's something\n\n2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:50.960\n that's, you know, totally legitimate\n\n2:10:50.960 --> 2:10:52.320\n to kind of fight it out.\n\n2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:54.800\n And I think it's great that there's different ecosystems\n\n2:10:54.800 --> 2:10:56.060\n that have different attitudes to things.\n\n2:10:56.060 --> 2:10:57.260\n Like, you know, I think, you know,\n\n2:10:57.260 --> 2:10:59.840\n there's a big possibility that, you know,\n\n2:10:59.840 --> 2:11:01.160\n things that the Ethereum,\n\n2:11:01.160 --> 2:11:03.280\n ways that the Ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems\n\n2:11:03.280 --> 2:11:04.100\n is totally wrong.\n\n2:11:04.100 --> 2:11:06.360\n And if there's other ecosystems with different principles\n\n2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:09.360\n and they do well, that's something that we can learn from.\n\n2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:11.560\n In the spirit of the depth for a search,\n\n2:11:11.560 --> 2:11:13.320\n can you comment on AI safety?\n\n2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:15.300\n And some people are really worried\n\n2:11:15.300 --> 2:11:18.440\n about the existential risks of artificial intelligence.\n\n2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:22.360\n Is there something you could say that's hopeful\n\n2:11:22.360 --> 2:11:26.720\n about how we avoid in the same kind of line of reasoning\n\n2:11:26.720 --> 2:11:30.140\n about creating formal models versus kind of looking\n\n2:11:30.140 --> 2:11:33.360\n outside the model into what the real world actually is like?\n\n2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:36.580\n Is there some lessons from that we can take\n\n2:11:36.580 --> 2:11:39.000\n and map onto the AI safety world\n\n2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.540\n where the potentials of the technology,\n\n2:11:41.540 --> 2:11:45.240\n whether it's in autonomous weapon systems\n\n2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:47.040\n or just the paperclip problem\n\n2:11:47.960 --> 2:11:50.840\n that we can avoid AI destroying the world?\n\n2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:54.360\n So my impression is actually that, like,\n\n2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:56.880\n this is more of a kind of far away impression\n\n2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:58.540\n and it could be wrong, that it might even be\n\n2:11:58.540 --> 2:12:01.480\n that one of the challenges is that AI is not formal enough.\n\n2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:05.860\n Like, because AI is very practitioner oriented, right?\n\n2:12:05.860 --> 2:12:08.600\n Like, it's all about like, hey, I found a couple of hacks\n\n2:12:08.600 --> 2:12:09.900\n and look, I ran them and look,\n\n2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:12.160\n they seem to improve classification accuracy\n\n2:12:12.160 --> 2:12:15.960\n from 0.684 to 0.773.\n\n2:12:15.960 --> 2:12:20.240\n So a lot of the time there just isn't actual science behind\n\n2:12:20.240 --> 2:12:23.720\n why this hack works and why this other hack doesn't work.\n\n2:12:23.720 --> 2:12:27.000\n You just sort of like trial and error your way into it.\n\n2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.160\n And I could see how that approach works,\n\n2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:31.280\n but at the same time, like,\n\n2:12:31.280 --> 2:12:34.440\n that approach is not good for eligibility, for example.\n\n2:12:34.440 --> 2:12:36.240\n Like, it's not good for like understanding\n\n2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:37.840\n what the heck is actually going on,\n\n2:12:37.840 --> 2:12:42.000\n like how these kinds of systems conceivably might fail.\n\n2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:45.940\n Like, there's even, you know, a debate on like,\n\n2:12:45.940 --> 2:12:49.200\n can you take GPT3 like things and just scale them up\n\n2:12:49.200 --> 2:12:51.360\n and their intelligence will continue to improve\n\n2:12:51.360 --> 2:12:53.680\n or is there just like some types of reasoning\n\n2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:54.960\n that they're fundamentally bad at\n\n2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.400\n and like they're not gonna get good at it\n\n2:12:57.400 --> 2:12:59.760\n no matter how much you like scale this exact same approach\n\n2:12:59.760 --> 2:13:01.200\n and add more hardware to it.\n\n2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:06.200\n So having like thinking about what's going on\n\n2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:08.160\n more explicitly, I mean, my understanding\n\n2:13:08.160 --> 2:13:10.520\n is that a big part of AI safety research\n\n2:13:10.520 --> 2:13:13.840\n is trying to do that sort of stuff, right?\n\n2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:14.840\n Formalize.\n\n2:13:14.840 --> 2:13:19.200\n Yeah, formalize, try to improve just AI eligibility,\n\n2:13:19.200 --> 2:13:21.140\n like trying to understand, you know,\n\n2:13:21.140 --> 2:13:23.040\n if the AI makes some classification\n\n2:13:23.040 --> 2:13:25.520\n so we can actually see like what happens\n\n2:13:25.520 --> 2:13:27.840\n and like what's going on in the middle, right?\n\n2:13:27.840 --> 2:13:30.880\n Whereas with crypto or with traditional cryptography,\n\n2:13:30.880 --> 2:13:33.140\n you know, it's like very much not,\n\n2:13:33.140 --> 2:13:35.240\n well, okay, I mean, I shouldn't quite say that.\n\n2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:37.900\n It's, traditional cryptography is this interesting mix\n\n2:13:37.900 --> 2:13:40.200\n of being very formal and being very informal\n\n2:13:40.200 --> 2:13:43.100\n because it's very formal with,\n\n2:13:43.100 --> 2:13:44.760\n given these security assumptions,\n\n2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:46.000\n prove that the protocol works\n\n2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:47.480\n under these security assumptions.\n\n2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:49.400\n The places where it's very informal is like,\n\n2:13:49.400 --> 2:13:51.280\n well, how do we even know that there isn't\n\n2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:53.480\n an efficient algorithm for factoring numbers?\n\n2:13:53.480 --> 2:13:56.000\n Yeah, we kind of tried it for 40 years.\n\n2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:57.360\n And then, you know, so far,\n\n2:13:57.360 --> 2:13:58.600\n no one's found anything better\n\n2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:00.840\n than the general number field sieve.\n\n2:14:00.840 --> 2:14:03.280\n And like, okay, fine, we'll just assume it's fine.\n\n2:14:03.280 --> 2:14:07.120\n You know, how do we know you can't find the discrete log\n\n2:14:07.120 --> 2:14:08.520\n between two elliptic curve points?\n\n2:14:08.520 --> 2:14:11.040\n Like, nope, did it a couple of decades,\n\n2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:13.360\n no one's found anything faster\n\n2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:15.760\n than like baby step, giant step stuff.\n\n2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:18.120\n So that's,\n\n2:14:18.120 --> 2:14:23.120\n and like, there's definitely ways\n\n2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:25.960\n in which that approach really makes sense, right?\n\n2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:28.800\n Because at least you can concentrate your analysis\n\n2:14:28.800 --> 2:14:30.820\n on a small number of building blocks.\n\n2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:33.000\n And like, you know, you do have some intuitive reasoning\n\n2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:33.940\n about those building blocks,\n\n2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:35.680\n but like at least there is a small number\n\n2:14:35.680 --> 2:14:38.000\n of building blocks and lots of people are looking at them.\n\n2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.400\n And then everything else just sort of gets formally built\n\n2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:43.040\n on top and you actually can like mathematically reduce\n\n2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:45.640\n the security of big things to building blocks, right?\n\n2:14:45.640 --> 2:14:47.800\n Like you can have mathematical proofs\n\n2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:51.120\n that say, you know, if you make a ZK Synarch\n\n2:14:51.120 --> 2:14:54.460\n of a yes statement when in reality that statement is false,\n\n2:14:54.460 --> 2:14:59.320\n then you can use that to like extract information\n\n2:14:59.320 --> 2:15:00.760\n out of elliptic curves that, you know,\n\n2:15:00.760 --> 2:15:03.760\n it completely breaks the problem or something like that.\n\n2:15:03.760 --> 2:15:04.600\n So.\n\n2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:08.520\n So ZK Synarch is an example where formalism is beneficial.\n\n2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:09.360\n Absolutely, yeah.\n\n2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:11.320\n And so maybe you can have the same kind of stuff\n\n2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:14.520\n in the AI safety within AI systems\n\n2:15:14.520 --> 2:15:18.740\n that you can get a hold of some kind of aspect\n\n2:15:18.740 --> 2:15:21.320\n of the systems that you can control provably.\n\n2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:24.080\n And then in blockchains and cryptocurrency,\n\n2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:27.360\n I think the one area where consensus mechanisms\n\n2:15:27.360 --> 2:15:29.000\n is still more an art than a science\n\n2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.060\n is that these aren't just like technological systems,\n\n2:15:32.060 --> 2:15:33.560\n they're crypto economic systems, right?\n\n2:15:33.560 --> 2:15:35.400\n And they make assumptions about people.\n\n2:15:35.400 --> 2:15:37.760\n And which assumptions you can make about people\n\n2:15:37.760 --> 2:15:39.540\n is not something that you can prove with math.\n\n2:15:39.540 --> 2:15:43.400\n Right, even just the basic 51%.\n\n2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:44.240\n Exactly.\n\n2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:45.160\n Honest.\n\n2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:47.360\n Can you trust the 51%?\n\n2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:49.200\n If you can't trust the 51%,\n\n2:15:49.200 --> 2:15:53.400\n can you trust the other 49% to be able to coordinate\n\n2:15:53.400 --> 2:15:55.080\n on like making their own fork?\n\n2:15:55.080 --> 2:15:56.560\n What will happen to coin prices?\n\n2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:00.000\n Like how do people as human beings react to these events?\n\n2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:02.320\n Like there's all of these assumptions.\n\n2:16:02.320 --> 2:16:03.720\n But no, at the same time,\n\n2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:05.640\n look, if you can write down the assumptions,\n\n2:16:05.640 --> 2:16:08.480\n then you can like do formal things with them.\n\n2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:10.400\n I almost forgot to ask you\n\n2:16:10.400 --> 2:16:13.280\n about one of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum.\n\n2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:14.520\n I mean, it's non technical.\n\n2:16:14.520 --> 2:16:19.520\n I think it's a societal, it's social, which is NFTs.\n\n2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:24.600\n So what do you think about the explosion of NFTs\n\n2:16:24.600 --> 2:16:28.840\n in the recent months, especially in the art world\n\n2:16:28.840 --> 2:16:31.600\n and beyond, and what does the future look like?\n\n2:16:31.600 --> 2:16:35.800\n So this is maybe the social impact on the world,\n\n2:16:35.800 --> 2:16:38.760\n on the individual creators of all kinds.\n\n2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:42.440\n Like is that something you've actually expected to see,\n\n2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:44.680\n NFTs having this kind of impact?\n\n2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:48.120\n And beyond, what do you think will happen\n\n2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:51.720\n in the digital space with NFTs,\n\n2:16:51.720 --> 2:16:54.560\n in virtual reality, in gaming, all those kinds of things?\n\n2:16:55.520 --> 2:16:58.920\n I was definitely surprised by like NFTs in particular.\n\n2:16:58.920 --> 2:17:02.240\n Like I even actually think might be on record somewhere\n\n2:17:02.240 --> 2:17:03.680\n on some tech conference panel.\n\n2:17:03.680 --> 2:17:05.200\n Like they were asking, you know,\n\n2:17:05.200 --> 2:17:07.480\n it was one of those overrated or underrated sections\n\n2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:09.240\n and ask about NFTs and I thought,\n\n2:17:09.240 --> 2:17:11.800\n and I said like, hey, I think NFTs are overrated.\n\n2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:12.880\n And, you know, in retrospect,\n\n2:17:12.880 --> 2:17:14.600\n that turned out to be quite wrong.\n\n2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:17.560\n I think, like, I guess I just personally\n\n2:17:17.560 --> 2:17:19.960\n can't really relate to this concept\n\n2:17:19.960 --> 2:17:22.240\n of like spending a lot of money on a thing.\n\n2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:24.680\n Like there's nothing, you know,\n\n2:17:24.680 --> 2:17:27.360\n there's no clear kind of understanding\n\n2:17:27.360 --> 2:17:31.120\n of why that thing would maintain its value.\n\n2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:34.640\n Uniqueness of a thing having value.\n\n2:17:34.640 --> 2:17:36.200\n Right, exactly.\n\n2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:39.960\n That's like, I definitely like cannot really understand,\n\n2:17:39.960 --> 2:17:42.000\n you know, the psychology behind like buying,\n\n2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:44.480\n you know, paying $200,000 for original art painting.\n\n2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:46.400\n I'd be like, you know, if I had a mansion,\n\n2:17:46.400 --> 2:17:48.520\n just like give me photocopies of everything.\n\n2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:52.200\n You can hang three photocopies of the Mona Lisa section.\n\n2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:53.360\n Why would I even have the Mona Lisa?\n\n2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:55.320\n I think I'd probably just like have some Nyan Cats\n\n2:17:55.320 --> 2:17:56.160\n or something.\n\n2:17:56.160 --> 2:17:57.680\n That's one thing where mathematics\n\n2:17:57.680 --> 2:18:00.000\n or theoretical computer science cannot formalize\n\n2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:01.680\n why the heck NFTs are valuable.\n\n2:18:01.680 --> 2:18:02.520\n Exactly.\n\n2:18:02.520 --> 2:18:07.200\n But the thing that makes me very happy about the space\n\n2:18:07.200 --> 2:18:09.600\n now that it has happened is that,\n\n2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:11.680\n and this gets back to the conversation\n\n2:18:11.680 --> 2:18:12.760\n that we had at the beginning, right?\n\n2:18:12.760 --> 2:18:14.440\n Like I'm interested in this concept\n\n2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:17.360\n of decentralized public goods funding, right?\n\n2:18:17.360 --> 2:18:20.800\n Like I want things that are good and valuable\n\n2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:23.720\n to as much as possible also be things\n\n2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:25.920\n that can economically sustain the people\n\n2:18:25.920 --> 2:18:26.960\n who produce them, right?\n\n2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:29.000\n Because if you don't have that,\n\n2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:32.000\n then either the public goods just don't get produced at all\n\n2:18:32.000 --> 2:18:34.560\n or people make like centralized versions\n\n2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:37.040\n that have some of the properties and try to be substitutes,\n\n2:18:37.040 --> 2:18:39.280\n but actually just like concentrate control\n\n2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:41.040\n in a very small group, right?\n\n2:18:41.040 --> 2:18:43.480\n And both of those things are not very nice.\n\n2:18:43.480 --> 2:18:46.240\n So the nice thing about NFTs would be,\n\n2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:49.560\n well, if you're an artist and you can just mint NFTs\n\n2:18:49.560 --> 2:18:50.640\n and this is a source of revenue,\n\n2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:52.720\n then like great, that's another stream of revenue\n\n2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:57.000\n for creative work that often does still get underfunded\n\n2:18:57.000 --> 2:18:58.160\n and that's amazing.\n\n2:18:58.160 --> 2:18:59.480\n Okay, let me ask you a weird question.\n\n2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:01.320\n We talked about Craig Wright a little bit,\n\n2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:06.320\n but a lot of people write to me, one of two emails.\n\n2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:11.320\n One email is calling any coin outside of Bitcoin a scam\n\n2:19:15.120 --> 2:19:17.760\n and then the other email is saying,\n\n2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:21.160\n my favorite coin is the best coin,\n\n2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:23.560\n it's going to save the world, whatever that coin is.\n\n2:19:25.560 --> 2:19:28.720\n And so I sit back and I look, I have no idea.\n\n2:19:28.720 --> 2:19:33.240\n I try to figure out like the humans that I trust\n\n2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:38.120\n in this space, just the basic human qualities,\n\n2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:41.780\n but do you think some coins are scams?\n\n2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:46.040\n Do you think some coins, maybe another way to ask it,\n\n2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:48.680\n are scamier than other coins?\n\n2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:51.320\n How are people that are looking outside of this space\n\n2:19:51.320 --> 2:19:53.640\n where there's all of these cryptocurrencies\n\n2:19:53.640 --> 2:19:57.520\n supposed to figure out what is a scam and not,\n\n2:19:57.520 --> 2:19:59.440\n or how to use the right kind of language\n\n2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:01.200\n when talking about them?\n\n2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:03.200\n Because there's the harshness of the language\n\n2:20:03.200 --> 2:20:06.160\n from the Bitcoin maximalists that doesn't just say\n\n2:20:06.160 --> 2:20:08.580\n everything's a scam, including Ethereum,\n\n2:20:09.500 --> 2:20:11.560\n but they use terms like shit coin\n\n2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:14.160\n that says it's not only a scam, it's like a waste of time.\n\n2:20:14.160 --> 2:20:17.080\n I mean, every word you can use, they say that.\n\n2:20:17.080 --> 2:20:18.400\n That's very harsh.\n\n2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:22.040\n And then some people just apply the word scam\n\n2:20:22.040 --> 2:20:26.740\n much, much more conservatively and just refer to coins\n\n2:20:26.740 --> 2:20:29.200\n that legitimately are trying to scam people\n\n2:20:29.200 --> 2:20:31.440\n out of their money as scams.\n\n2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:33.120\n So what do we do with this word scam?\n\n2:20:33.120 --> 2:20:35.440\n Should it ever be applied to coins?\n\n2:20:35.440 --> 2:20:39.280\n And is it a binary thing or is it a gray area?\n\n2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:42.840\n I think it's definitely a gray area.\n\n2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:46.280\n There's definitely things that are really and actually scams.\n\n2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:48.240\n I mean, Bitconnect would be one example\n\n2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:51.640\n of something that's way on the scam spectrum.\n\n2:20:51.640 --> 2:20:54.880\n Did you see their 2017 promotional video, by the way?\n\n2:20:54.880 --> 2:20:55.720\n Of Bitconnect?\n\n2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:59.040\n Yeah, hey, hey, hey, what's up, what's up, what's up?\n\n2:20:59.040 --> 2:20:59.880\n Bitconnect!\n\n2:21:01.520 --> 2:21:03.760\n It was this three minute, 48 second video\n\n2:21:03.760 --> 2:21:07.800\n that was just of this guy making this totally crazy rant.\n\n2:21:07.800 --> 2:21:10.720\n And it was at some conference in Vietnam\n\n2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:12.920\n where they were, of course, trying to convince\n\n2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:14.560\n a whole bunch of people to buy this coin\n\n2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:17.680\n and they had these claims about how it would go up in value.\n\n2:21:17.680 --> 2:21:20.580\n That was definitely the peak of these pure,\n\n2:21:23.080 --> 2:21:24.520\n completely scammy coins.\n\n2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:27.640\n And that was definitely really terrible.\n\n2:21:27.640 --> 2:21:29.640\n And I feel like we have less,\n\n2:21:29.640 --> 2:21:31.640\n despite cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger,\n\n2:21:31.640 --> 2:21:34.880\n we actually have quite a bit less of that now.\n\n2:21:34.880 --> 2:21:37.820\n But then, of course, there's this spectrum\n\n2:21:37.820 --> 2:21:40.200\n of things that are not completely scams\n\n2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:42.520\n and then things that are not scams\n\n2:21:42.520 --> 2:21:44.440\n and that are technically totally fine projects\n\n2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:48.520\n but where their community is just incredibly sketchy\n\n2:21:48.520 --> 2:21:50.560\n and then all the way to things\n\n2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:52.440\n that are where the community is nice\n\n2:21:52.440 --> 2:21:55.360\n but maybe the project is just fundamentally incapable\n\n2:21:55.360 --> 2:21:56.640\n of achieving what it's trying to do\n\n2:21:56.640 --> 2:21:57.960\n or in the community doesn't realize\n\n2:21:57.960 --> 2:22:00.160\n and then really good projects, right?\n\n2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:04.200\n So if you wanna go a step,\n\n2:22:04.200 --> 2:22:06.800\n like if that's 100% scam,\n\n2:22:06.800 --> 2:22:09.600\n then what would I call say 80% scam?\n\n2:22:09.600 --> 2:22:11.240\n Well, like Bitcoin SV is one example.\n\n2:22:11.240 --> 2:22:13.640\n This is a Craig Wright's fork of Bitcoin.\n\n2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:15.600\n Theoretically, it's a blockchain, right?\n\n2:22:15.600 --> 2:22:17.000\n It's a fork of Bitcoin.\n\n2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.200\n It has some 512 megabyte blocks.\n\n2:22:20.200 --> 2:22:23.360\n If you really wanted to, you could use the blockchain.\n\n2:22:23.360 --> 2:22:24.600\n It satisfies the property\n\n2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:27.280\n so that you can send transactions onto it.\n\n2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:30.760\n You can probably use it as a backup\n\n2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:32.840\n to store your files if you really wanted to\n\n2:22:32.840 --> 2:22:35.840\n just because it has so much space.\n\n2:22:35.840 --> 2:22:40.840\n It might fail, but at the same time,\n\n2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:46.480\n as we basically said, Craig Wright is a scammer\n\n2:22:46.480 --> 2:22:49.640\n and half the community is just totally batshit insane.\n\n2:22:49.640 --> 2:22:53.280\n So the humans of a particular cryptocurrency\n\n2:22:53.280 --> 2:22:56.360\n is what makes for a scam and not like the humans at the top\n\n2:22:56.360 --> 2:22:58.960\n that have a voice guiding the community.\n\n2:22:58.960 --> 2:23:01.720\n Yeah, I think in the case of BSV,\n\n2:23:01.720 --> 2:23:04.840\n the humans, they make just completely wrong\n\n2:23:04.840 --> 2:23:07.680\n and just obviously wrong claims\n\n2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:10.200\n about what BSV is capable of accomplishing\n\n2:23:10.200 --> 2:23:12.640\n and what it can say we could accomplish.\n\n2:23:12.640 --> 2:23:15.320\n And there's just a lot of aspects of it\n\n2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:17.160\n that make it feel like a money grab.\n\n2:23:17.160 --> 2:23:18.400\n So that's one example.\n\n2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:20.840\n And then you gotta go a bit further\n\n2:23:20.840 --> 2:23:23.440\n and then you have the trons of the world.\n\n2:23:23.440 --> 2:23:26.160\n And that's a platform, you can use it,\n\n2:23:26.160 --> 2:23:27.960\n you can do stuff on it.\n\n2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:32.480\n But at the same time, they did plagiarize the IPFS white paper\n\n2:23:32.480 --> 2:23:34.560\n and then they...\n\n2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:36.600\n So there's scammy qualities.\n\n2:23:36.600 --> 2:23:38.560\n See, the thing that throws me off a lot,\n\n2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:43.560\n it's very difficult for me, is that most coins,\n\n2:23:43.920 --> 2:23:47.600\n but the ones that make me feel like are scammy\n\n2:23:47.600 --> 2:23:49.520\n have a large community of people\n\n2:23:49.520 --> 2:23:53.160\n that are super positive about it.\n\n2:23:53.160 --> 2:23:54.720\n Like, and they'll write to me.\n\n2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:00.480\n Now that said, sort of on the flip side of that,\n\n2:24:00.480 --> 2:24:04.160\n Bitcoin people are also very positive.\n\n2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:05.360\n There's some sense in...\n\n2:24:05.360 --> 2:24:09.480\n The reason I was having like squinty eyes\n\n2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:12.600\n looking at Bitcoin for quite a while\n\n2:24:12.600 --> 2:24:14.760\n is like, why is everyone so positive?\n\n2:24:14.760 --> 2:24:18.000\n I was getting total cult vibes.\n\n2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:22.400\n Like the ideas are not grounded in truth,\n\n2:24:22.400 --> 2:24:25.640\n but are grounded in an obsession\n\n2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:29.000\n of like when you can artificially conjure up a truth,\n\n2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.680\n which is why I was a little bit like worried about Bitcoin.\n\n2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:33.280\n I think I've learned a lot since then\n\n2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:38.280\n to where like, I learned to separate the community\n\n2:24:38.560 --> 2:24:39.880\n from the ideas.\n\n2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:43.920\n And I think Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea on many fronts,\n\n2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:48.080\n but still a community that's like dogmatically excited\n\n2:24:48.080 --> 2:24:51.240\n about something, whatever that is, makes me skeptical.\n\n2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:53.680\n Maybe it's just like my upbringing,\n\n2:24:53.680 --> 2:24:56.960\n but when everybody's really excited about something,\n\n2:24:56.960 --> 2:25:00.400\n it makes me skeptical.\n\n2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:03.800\n But it also makes me difficult to decide\n\n2:25:03.800 --> 2:25:04.760\n what is this scam or not,\n\n2:25:04.760 --> 2:25:07.320\n because some of the most exciting ideas in this world\n\n2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:09.680\n have a community of people who are excited about it, right?\n\n2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:12.360\n Because it's, I don't know.\n\n2:25:12.360 --> 2:25:14.840\n I think space exploration is super exciting.\n\n2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:17.960\n And there's people, I know a lot of them\n\n2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:21.400\n that are exceptionally excited about space exploration.\n\n2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:23.360\n Does that mean it's a scam?\n\n2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:24.840\n No.\n\n2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:26.200\n So I don't know what to do with that.\n\n2:25:26.200 --> 2:25:28.680\n And so most I just try to stay away, I suppose,\n\n2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:31.320\n but it's unfortunate because I'm sure there's a lot\n\n2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:33.720\n of exciting technologies in that space.\n\n2:25:33.720 --> 2:25:34.760\n Like in the case of Bitcoin,\n\n2:25:34.760 --> 2:25:36.800\n like I would definitely not call Bitcoin a scam.\n\n2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:37.640\n Right.\n\n2:25:37.640 --> 2:25:42.640\n But I would also not call Litecoin a scam.\n\n2:25:43.360 --> 2:25:45.200\n There's people who call Litecoin a scam\n\n2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:47.520\n because they just like say, oh, look,\n\n2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:49.360\n it has no fundamental use case.\n\n2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:52.840\n And the concept of being silver to Bitcoin's gold\n\n2:25:52.840 --> 2:25:53.960\n is just like stupid.\n\n2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:58.240\n And like milli Bitcoin is the silver to Bitcoin's gold.\n\n2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:03.120\n But at the same time, like if you have these people\n\n2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:06.640\n who just, they do seem to earnestly believe this.\n\n2:26:06.640 --> 2:26:09.680\n And like they're trying to just like make Litecoin\n\n2:26:09.680 --> 2:26:11.480\n be a Litecoin as best as they can.\n\n2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:14.760\n Then like, to me that's enough for it to not be a scam.\n\n2:26:17.920 --> 2:26:21.440\n And then, so yeah, I think the biggest gray area\n\n2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:26.440\n is definitely between like projects that are earnest\n\n2:26:27.920 --> 2:26:30.520\n but they have just all sorts of these\n\n2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:34.400\n like different combinations of flawed qualities to them.\n\n2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:36.760\n I mean, the ones that legitimately is a scam\n\n2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:40.000\n is when the key people that are at the head of the project\n\n2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:42.440\n are intentionally lying.\n\n2:26:42.440 --> 2:26:45.920\n And I think as long as the intent\n\n2:26:45.920 --> 2:26:48.160\n is to try to do good in the world,\n\n2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:51.800\n even if your actual implementation of that is flawed,\n\n2:26:51.800 --> 2:26:53.520\n I think that's not a scam.\n\n2:26:53.520 --> 2:26:55.680\n It could be flawed ideas, it could be wrong ideas,\n\n2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:56.760\n but it's not a scam.\n\n2:26:58.000 --> 2:27:00.560\n I'm learning to navigate this space.\n\n2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:03.960\n Yeah, it's definitely a very challenging space\n\n2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:07.840\n to navigate, I mean, it's in some ways\n\n2:27:07.840 --> 2:27:10.240\n the reflection of the world at large.\n\n2:27:10.240 --> 2:27:13.040\n Yeah, and as we've said, maybe offline\n\n2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:15.200\n that the fact that money is involved\n\n2:27:15.200 --> 2:27:17.480\n makes it a little bit more complicated\n\n2:27:17.480 --> 2:27:22.480\n that lives can be ruined by the choice of technologies\n\n2:27:24.840 --> 2:27:25.680\n that are taken on.\n\n2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:28.920\n So it makes it more real, more painful,\n\n2:27:28.920 --> 2:27:31.720\n more like elevated the impact of this.\n\n2:27:31.720 --> 2:27:35.160\n Like imagine like Mac versus PC wars\n\n2:27:35.160 --> 2:27:38.520\n if everyone who bought a MacBook had 10 Apple shares\n\n2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:40.200\n inside of it, and everyone who had a PC\n\n2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:42.360\n had 10 Microsoft shares inside of it.\n\n2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:45.960\n And then you had the elites who bought their Macs\n\n2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:48.960\n back in 1983, and then they spent $500 debt,\n\n2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:50.400\n and now they have $40 million,\n\n2:27:50.400 --> 2:27:52.720\n and they just think that they're these gurus\n\n2:27:52.720 --> 2:27:55.360\n who understands the future of finance and geopolitics,\n\n2:27:55.360 --> 2:27:59.080\n and they make theories about why Apple is the one\n\n2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:00.720\n that's gonna bring freedom to the world,\n\n2:28:00.720 --> 2:28:05.120\n and Windows is secretly allied with the axis of evil.\n\n2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:06.120\n Oh, that's brilliant.\n\n2:28:06.120 --> 2:28:07.720\n So yeah, this is so brilliant.\n\n2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.560\n So I think the right way to think about this\n\n2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:12.660\n is we map some of the cryptocurrency battles\n\n2:28:12.660 --> 2:28:14.800\n into the space of like EMAX versus VIM,\n\n2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.340\n or Apple versus PC, if there were some stock\n\n2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:23.960\n that came along with each implementation of each PC,\n\n2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:25.640\n each Mac, that's fascinating.\n\n2:28:25.640 --> 2:28:28.880\n This is 100% correct, 100% correct.\n\n2:28:28.880 --> 2:28:31.160\n Because then that really energizes the armies\n\n2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:32.640\n of people debating over this in a way\n\n2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:35.580\n that something without money does not.\n\n2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:38.540\n Okay, let me ask you about something really fascinating\n\n2:28:38.540 --> 2:28:41.500\n that you are also excited about, which is longevity,\n\n2:28:42.520 --> 2:28:44.240\n antiaging.\n\n2:28:44.240 --> 2:28:48.280\n You have donated money to the SENS Foundation,\n\n2:28:48.280 --> 2:28:50.800\n so you have an interest in this whole space\n\n2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:51.980\n of lifespan research.\n\n2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:54.560\n What's your vision here?\n\n2:28:54.560 --> 2:28:58.000\n Or what do you hope to see in antiaging\n\n2:28:58.000 --> 2:28:59.880\n and longevity research?\n\n2:28:59.880 --> 2:29:03.120\n I think I hope to see the concept\n\n2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:06.440\n of seeing your parents and grandparents die\n\n2:29:06.440 --> 2:29:08.940\n just slowly disappear from the public consciousness\n\n2:29:08.940 --> 2:29:10.680\n as an experience that happens\n\n2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:12.600\n over the course of half a century,\n\n2:29:12.600 --> 2:29:15.080\n the same way that getting lost in a city\n\n2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:16.960\n slowly disappeared over the public consciousness\n\n2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:19.760\n over the last 50 now that we have smartphones.\n\n2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:21.960\n The thing you have from Nick Bostrom,\n\n2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:26.840\n the essay pinned in your Twitter argues\n\n2:29:26.840 --> 2:29:31.840\n that essentially death is almost unethical.\n\n2:29:33.160 --> 2:29:36.360\n The fact that we don't do something about this thing that,\n\n2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:38.680\n this, in the essay, is a dragon\n\n2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:43.560\n that keeps murdering everybody around us,\n\n2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:46.000\n including our parents and grandparents,\n\n2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.380\n is, the fact that we don't try to do something aggressively\n\n2:29:49.380 --> 2:29:53.360\n about that dragon doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:29:53.360 --> 2:29:58.360\n So you think this is a battle worth fighting,\n\n2:29:58.560 --> 2:30:01.760\n a battle for immortality, or at least longevity?\n\n2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:02.700\n I'd say absolutely.\n\n2:30:02.700 --> 2:30:07.700\n And I'd say a battle where we really have started\n\n2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:09.560\n over the last five years in particular\n\n2:30:09.560 --> 2:30:13.000\n to see the first cracks of humanity\n\n2:30:13.000 --> 2:30:16.080\n starting to make things that look like\n\n2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:17.480\n they'll turn into victories.\n\n2:30:18.600 --> 2:30:22.680\n Do you think humans can eventually live forever?\n\n2:30:22.680 --> 2:30:26.120\n And maybe as a side comment to that,\n\n2:30:26.120 --> 2:30:28.000\n what technology do you think will enable that\n\n2:30:28.000 --> 2:30:29.960\n as a genetic modification?\n\n2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:32.440\n Is it cloning, is it uploading your mind?\n\n2:30:32.440 --> 2:30:34.680\n Define forever, like are we talking 1,000 years,\n\n2:30:34.680 --> 2:30:38.480\n a million, 10 to the 14, 10 to the 45?\n\n2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:40.520\n Well, let's start, as I tweeted today,\n\n2:30:40.520 --> 2:30:43.040\n eventually everything, the universe will be filled\n\n2:30:43.040 --> 2:30:44.740\n with supermassive black holes.\n\n2:30:44.740 --> 2:30:49.120\n So that forever, maybe like backtracking to where.\n\n2:30:49.120 --> 2:30:52.420\n We'll have 10 to the 16 years to figure it out.\n\n2:30:52.420 --> 2:30:54.120\n Yes, exactly.\n\n2:30:55.360 --> 2:30:59.920\n Yeah, maybe travel between the multiverse,\n\n2:30:59.920 --> 2:31:02.920\n between the different universes of the multiverse.\n\n2:31:02.920 --> 2:31:07.920\n I mean, but forever meaning like, you know, millennia.\n\n2:31:11.640 --> 2:31:13.920\n I definitely think that we can get there.\n\n2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:15.900\n I definitely think that it's the sort of thing\n\n2:31:15.900 --> 2:31:19.280\n that's going to take an insanely huge amount of work.\n\n2:31:19.280 --> 2:31:21.240\n And I definitely think it's the sort of thing\n\n2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:24.760\n where once we figure out the first crop of problems\n\n2:31:24.760 --> 2:31:27.640\n and like people start living to 150,\n\n2:31:27.640 --> 2:31:29.680\n we'll just realize that there's like 10 other problems\n\n2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:32.120\n that kill you half as slowly and we'll have to do more work.\n\n2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:36.120\n But the good news is that this is Aubrey's longevity\n\n2:31:36.120 --> 2:31:38.480\n escape velocity argument that if you get everyone\n\n2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:41.400\n to live to 150 now, then you have half a century\n\n2:31:41.400 --> 2:31:43.400\n to fix all those other problems as well.\n\n2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:47.380\n So I'm optimistic for that reason.\n\n2:31:47.380 --> 2:31:52.080\n I think you definitely do not want to underestimate\n\n2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:54.480\n human ingenuity, especially over the longterm.\n\n2:31:54.480 --> 2:31:56.400\n Like just to look at what happens to computers\n\n2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:00.000\n between the ENIAC in 1950 and we're around 2020, right?\n\n2:32:00.000 --> 2:32:02.720\n Like that's a span of 70 years.\n\n2:32:02.720 --> 2:32:04.640\n So like, you know, both of us, I think,\n\n2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:08.000\n with just present day technology,\n\n2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:11.040\n I have like at least 70 more years to live.\n\n2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:12.960\n So just like imagine what kind of sea change\n\n2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:16.080\n will happen in biomedicine during that time.\n\n2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:17.800\n And the other thing that made me optimistic\n\n2:32:17.800 --> 2:32:22.480\n is that I actually think COVID has been this kind of event\n\n2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:26.520\n that's really kind of pushed biomedicine\n\n2:32:26.520 --> 2:32:29.800\n and especially like activist approaches to biomedicine\n\n2:32:29.800 --> 2:32:32.420\n really into the public consciousness, right?\n\n2:32:32.420 --> 2:32:36.200\n Like it basically, it's put people into this mindset\n\n2:32:36.200 --> 2:32:37.840\n that, you know, wait, but like, you know,\n\n2:32:37.840 --> 2:32:39.840\n it's not just like, you know, the bits and tweets\n\n2:32:39.840 --> 2:32:41.880\n that are gonna save the world, you know,\n\n2:32:41.880 --> 2:32:46.040\n the bio is actually like super important and huge.\n\n2:32:46.040 --> 2:32:51.040\n And, you know, ultimately what's ending COVID basically,\n\n2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:53.360\n you know, is the vaccines\n\n2:32:53.360 --> 2:32:56.160\n and the vaccines have just been, you know, amazing.\n\n2:32:56.160 --> 2:33:01.160\n And if you can take that energy and also like this,\n\n2:33:03.360 --> 2:33:05.840\n I think philosophical attitude that I've noticed,\n\n2:33:05.840 --> 2:33:07.580\n like the way that I would describe\n\n2:33:07.580 --> 2:33:09.960\n the philosophical attitude here,\n\n2:33:09.960 --> 2:33:12.000\n this is going more depth first,\n\n2:33:12.000 --> 2:33:15.840\n is that I think the way that I kind of interpret\n\n2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:19.560\n part of what I would call late 20th century ideology\n\n2:33:19.560 --> 2:33:21.760\n is that there is this mentality that, you know,\n\n2:33:21.760 --> 2:33:25.600\n nature is good and disruptions from nature are bad\n\n2:33:25.600 --> 2:33:28.520\n and generally you wanna minimize disruptions from nature.\n\n2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:31.160\n And like this exists everywhere in the political spectrum.\n\n2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:33.280\n So there's nature as in literal nature.\n\n2:33:33.280 --> 2:33:35.760\n And my view is that like the right wing version of that\n\n2:33:35.760 --> 2:33:37.380\n is markets as nature, right?\n\n2:33:37.380 --> 2:33:42.380\n Like, you know, the way that like that kind of philosophy\n\n2:33:44.020 --> 2:33:45.940\n talks about, you know, markets\n\n2:33:45.940 --> 2:33:48.260\n and like the goal of not interfering with them,\n\n2:33:48.260 --> 2:33:51.380\n like, you know, it is very kind of like nature styled.\n\n2:33:51.380 --> 2:33:53.860\n And then of course, you know, the conservative one,\n\n2:33:53.860 --> 2:33:56.940\n which is like traditional culture that existed\n\n2:33:56.940 --> 2:33:59.460\n before the activists started controlling everything\n\n2:33:59.460 --> 2:34:01.940\n as also being a kind of nature.\n\n2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:05.260\n But the 21st century attitude and like really COVID,\n\n2:34:05.260 --> 2:34:08.620\n you know, has flipped a lot of minds\n\n2:34:08.620 --> 2:34:10.820\n because with COVID what's happened is that,\n\n2:34:10.820 --> 2:34:13.740\n well, no, like it's not, nature is not safe, right?\n\n2:34:13.740 --> 2:34:17.340\n The default is that is like, you know, untold misery\n\n2:34:17.340 --> 2:34:19.620\n and suffering in tens of millions of people dying.\n\n2:34:19.620 --> 2:34:22.300\n The only way out for us is through\n\n2:34:22.300 --> 2:34:25.820\n like basically human ingenuity.\n\n2:34:25.820 --> 2:34:30.260\n And that frame of mind is one that's like much more friendly\n\n2:34:30.260 --> 2:34:35.260\n to one, this other change of minds that I want to see,\n\n2:34:36.260 --> 2:34:37.740\n which is like basically treating aging\n\n2:34:37.740 --> 2:34:39.540\n as an engineering problem, right?\n\n2:34:39.540 --> 2:34:43.300\n Like the default is all 7.8 billion human beings\n\n2:34:43.300 --> 2:34:44.860\n that are currently on this earth are gonna die\n\n2:34:44.860 --> 2:34:47.260\n and they're gonna live their last decade of life\n\n2:34:47.260 --> 2:34:48.820\n in debilitating pain.\n\n2:34:48.820 --> 2:34:51.900\n And the only way to stop that is human ingenuity.\n\n2:34:51.900 --> 2:34:54.520\n And, you know, we don't have that solution yet,\n\n2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:56.620\n but, you know, if we work hard, we will.\n\n2:34:56.620 --> 2:34:58.680\n And more and more people on the biology side,\n\n2:34:58.680 --> 2:35:00.780\n computational biology are basically converting\n\n2:35:00.780 --> 2:35:05.340\n the mess of the human biology into an engineering problem.\n\n2:35:05.340 --> 2:35:07.380\n And once that conversion is happening,\n\n2:35:07.380 --> 2:35:09.860\n looking at the genetic code, the proteins,\n\n2:35:09.860 --> 2:35:12.380\n all those kinds of things, once that conversion happens,\n\n2:35:12.380 --> 2:35:15.340\n you can now apply the tools that we know\n\n2:35:15.340 --> 2:35:18.140\n how to solve engineering problems to solving it that way.\n\n2:35:18.140 --> 2:35:21.160\n And then there's also the other version, which is, you know,\n\n2:35:21.160 --> 2:35:24.580\n why do we romanticize this meat vehicle\n\n2:35:24.580 --> 2:35:28.500\n that ultimately is just the thing that carries the brain,\n\n2:35:28.500 --> 2:35:30.460\n maybe we can more and more convert ourselves\n\n2:35:30.460 --> 2:35:32.540\n into the digital realm.\n\n2:35:32.540 --> 2:35:35.660\n This is where like Neuralink have the computer interfaces\n\n2:35:35.660 --> 2:35:38.660\n and then achieve immortality in the space of information\n\n2:35:38.660 --> 2:35:40.940\n and the digital space versus the biology space.\n\n2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:42.660\n That stuff's interesting too, I agree.\n\n2:35:42.660 --> 2:35:45.980\n Again, I think, you know, we have enough resources\n\n2:35:45.980 --> 2:35:48.060\n and we should just try all the parallel tracks.\n\n2:35:48.060 --> 2:35:50.260\n You know, it's great that we have people\n\n2:35:50.260 --> 2:35:51.520\n just trying to make our bodies work.\n\n2:35:51.520 --> 2:35:54.540\n It's great that we have people trying to upload\n\n2:35:54.540 --> 2:35:56.560\n or improve brain scanning.\n\n2:35:56.560 --> 2:35:58.500\n It's also great that we have just like people\n\n2:35:58.500 --> 2:35:59.500\n improving cryonics.\n\n2:35:59.500 --> 2:36:01.300\n So like we could just like, you know,\n\n2:36:01.300 --> 2:36:04.140\n go to sleep in the freezer and eventually,\n\n2:36:04.140 --> 2:36:06.620\n hopefully sometime in the future, you know,\n\n2:36:06.620 --> 2:36:08.740\n Hal Finney is gonna be able to wake up,\n\n2:36:08.740 --> 2:36:13.740\n all of this, you know, anyone who gets cryo chronically\n\n2:36:13.740 --> 2:36:15.260\n frozen today will be able to wake up,\n\n2:36:15.260 --> 2:36:17.300\n but you know, that's a bet, right?\n\n2:36:17.300 --> 2:36:18.700\n That's the last resort.\n\n2:36:18.700 --> 2:36:20.340\n And then the other interesting thing\n\n2:36:20.340 --> 2:36:23.980\n about the like extreme uploading approach, right,\n\n2:36:23.980 --> 2:36:27.300\n is we're excited about space.\n\n2:36:27.300 --> 2:36:32.300\n And one of the points that a lot of science\n\n2:36:32.620 --> 2:36:34.460\n or like hard science fiction types make\n\n2:36:34.460 --> 2:36:36.000\n is that, you know, if you want to explore space,\n\n2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:38.400\n that's a lot easier if you're not a human, right?\n\n2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:40.820\n Like one example of this is that, you know,\n\n2:36:40.820 --> 2:36:42.920\n in the context of humans, we're talking about like,\n\n2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:44.340\n oh, we're gonna be able to go to the moon,\n\n2:36:44.340 --> 2:36:46.180\n oh, we're gonna be able to go to Mars,\n\n2:36:46.180 --> 2:36:49.580\n but there's this project called Starshot, I believe, right?\n\n2:36:49.580 --> 2:36:52.900\n That's basically trying to send spacecraft\n\n2:36:52.900 --> 2:36:55.220\n to mini spacecrafts to Alpha Centauri,\n\n2:36:55.220 --> 2:36:58.180\n and they literally believe that they're going to be able\n\n2:36:58.180 --> 2:37:00.020\n to get spacecraft over to Alpha Centauri\n\n2:37:00.020 --> 2:37:03.440\n like four light years away by like the 2060s.\n\n2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:04.280\n Now, I mean.\n\n2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:05.540\n By traveling close to the speed of light, yeah.\n\n2:37:05.540 --> 2:37:08.260\n Exactly, like, so the way it works is, you know,\n\n2:37:08.260 --> 2:37:09.300\n you have these light sails,\n\n2:37:09.300 --> 2:37:10.980\n like you basically take these a spacecraft\n\n2:37:10.980 --> 2:37:12.380\n and you shine a laser at it,\n\n2:37:12.380 --> 2:37:13.940\n and the laser is insanely strong,\n\n2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:17.060\n quickly accelerated at a hundred Gs or,\n\n2:37:17.060 --> 2:37:18.780\n no, I think it was 10,000 Gs\n\n2:37:18.780 --> 2:37:20.900\n until it gets to 20% of the speed of light,\n\n2:37:20.900 --> 2:37:22.940\n and then, you know, it goes on your merry way, right?\n\n2:37:22.940 --> 2:37:26.060\n So if you wants to be in,\n\n2:37:27.340 --> 2:37:30.100\n like personally explore the Alpha Centauri system\n\n2:37:30.100 --> 2:37:33.600\n within like two centuries or one century,\n\n2:37:33.600 --> 2:37:37.520\n then, you know, being a robot is like,\n\n2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:39.380\n by far the most practical way to do it,\n\n2:37:39.380 --> 2:37:40.820\n because there's no way that a human being\n\n2:37:40.820 --> 2:37:42.480\n can survive 10,000 Gs.\n\n2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:45.220\n So it's definitely interesting longterm,\n\n2:37:45.220 --> 2:37:47.260\n but at the same time,\n\n2:37:47.260 --> 2:37:50.060\n there's definitely a lot of like psychological hangups\n\n2:37:50.060 --> 2:37:52.100\n and a lot of like deep philosophy\n\n2:37:52.100 --> 2:37:55.660\n that we'll just have to grapple with to get there.\n\n2:37:55.660 --> 2:37:57.940\n I think what it hangs on the topic\n\n2:37:57.940 --> 2:37:59.900\n of whether we can convert consciousness\n\n2:37:59.900 --> 2:38:01.420\n into an engineering problem.\n\n2:38:01.420 --> 2:38:05.180\n So like, is consciousness tied to our biology?\n\n2:38:05.180 --> 2:38:07.740\n Because the moment we can convert consciousness\n\n2:38:07.740 --> 2:38:09.100\n into a digital form,\n\n2:38:09.100 --> 2:38:11.860\n then we can send it with that light sail\n\n2:38:11.860 --> 2:38:12.820\n to Alpha Centauri.\n\n2:38:12.820 --> 2:38:16.380\n Until then, a robot is not carrying anything\n\n2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:18.580\n except maybe some basic knowledge like Wikipedia.\n\n2:38:18.580 --> 2:38:21.620\n It's not carrying the flame of human consciousness.\n\n2:38:21.620 --> 2:38:25.580\n I have high hopes for converting consciousness\n\n2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:27.460\n into an engineering problem.\n\n2:38:27.460 --> 2:38:30.180\n In fact, I think it's not as difficult as people think.\n\n2:38:30.180 --> 2:38:31.540\n I'm like, yeah, I agree with that.\n\n2:38:31.540 --> 2:38:33.900\n I'm definitely in the camp that consciousness\n\n2:38:33.900 --> 2:38:35.900\n is a property of the algorithm\n\n2:38:35.900 --> 2:38:38.660\n and not a property of a brain structure.\n\n2:38:38.660 --> 2:38:41.500\n The other fun, like the kinds of philosophical things\n\n2:38:41.500 --> 2:38:43.700\n we'd have to grapple with is like,\n\n2:38:43.700 --> 2:38:46.140\n once you upload yourself, like you can hit Control C,\n\n2:38:46.140 --> 2:38:48.500\n you know, like it wouldn't be lovely\n\n2:38:48.500 --> 2:38:50.740\n to have like 10 copies of Alex Friedman\n\n2:38:50.740 --> 2:38:53.380\n and then like we could just interview everyone.\n\n2:38:53.380 --> 2:38:56.180\n So this is, I mean, this is, I have to ask this question.\n\n2:38:56.180 --> 2:38:57.380\n It's a difficult one,\n\n2:38:57.380 --> 2:39:00.380\n which I don't think it'd be wonderful, first of all.\n\n2:39:01.660 --> 2:39:02.500\n Sure.\n\n2:39:02.500 --> 2:39:04.300\n So in the following way,\n\n2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:06.340\n and this has to do with immortality as well,\n\n2:39:06.340 --> 2:39:11.340\n there's something about scarcity that creates value.\n\n2:39:11.460 --> 2:39:13.340\n Or there's a bunch of philosophers,\n\n2:39:13.340 --> 2:39:16.260\n Viktor Frankl, Bernard Williams, Ernest Becker,\n\n2:39:16.260 --> 2:39:20.140\n they argue that death or the scarcity of life\n\n2:39:20.140 --> 2:39:21.380\n creates meaning.\n\n2:39:21.380 --> 2:39:24.420\n The reason we, life is beautiful,\n\n2:39:24.420 --> 2:39:27.660\n the reason so many moments of experience\n\n2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:31.620\n of love or delicious food,\n\n2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:34.460\n all those things are made delicious\n\n2:39:34.460 --> 2:39:36.900\n because they're finite, because they end,\n\n2:39:36.900 --> 2:39:39.620\n and because we don't have that many of them.\n\n2:39:39.620 --> 2:39:40.940\n And there's a kind of worry\n\n2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:43.780\n that if we extend the human lifespan,\n\n2:39:43.780 --> 2:39:46.900\n if we achieve immortality, or if we, God forbid,\n\n2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:51.380\n clone me multiple times,\n\n2:39:51.380 --> 2:39:53.940\n then you lose the richness of what it means\n\n2:39:53.940 --> 2:39:56.980\n to have this life, to have this experience.\n\n2:39:56.980 --> 2:39:58.420\n Is that worry you at all?\n\n2:39:58.420 --> 2:39:59.780\n Do you think there's some aspect\n\n2:39:59.780 --> 2:40:02.780\n to which death does in fact give meaning to life?\n\n2:40:02.780 --> 2:40:05.460\n I guess like the one historical parallel,\n\n2:40:05.460 --> 2:40:06.900\n and this might be a bit unfair,\n\n2:40:06.900 --> 2:40:09.060\n is that there have been philosophers\n\n2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:11.340\n that have said things like,\n\n2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:14.500\n war gives meaning to human collectives,\n\n2:40:14.500 --> 2:40:18.860\n and the struggle for supremacy between nations and races\n\n2:40:18.860 --> 2:40:21.060\n is this big driver of progress\n\n2:40:21.060 --> 2:40:25.220\n that ensures that everyone strives to be their best.\n\n2:40:25.220 --> 2:40:28.900\n And of course, this viewpoint got into the head\n\n2:40:28.900 --> 2:40:30.940\n of a crazy Austrian guy, and 20 years later,\n\n2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:33.260\n his soldiers were shooting at my grandparents.\n\n2:40:33.260 --> 2:40:36.900\n So these days we don't really have that,\n\n2:40:36.900 --> 2:40:39.500\n but yet life still feels meaningful.\n\n2:40:39.500 --> 2:40:41.340\n We've still found other ways to,\n\n2:40:43.900 --> 2:40:47.220\n there's still a striving for technological progress.\n\n2:40:47.220 --> 2:40:52.220\n There's still a striving for self improvements in general.\n\n2:40:52.740 --> 2:40:55.380\n And it turns out that you don't actually need\n\n2:40:55.380 --> 2:40:58.780\n to have existential conflicts in order to have that.\n\n2:40:58.780 --> 2:40:59.940\n Now, maybe you need conflict,\n\n2:40:59.940 --> 2:41:01.300\n but we have other kinds of conflict, right?\n\n2:41:01.300 --> 2:41:03.700\n Like we have competition between businesses,\n\n2:41:03.700 --> 2:41:05.460\n competition between political ideologies,\n\n2:41:05.460 --> 2:41:07.580\n competition between projects.\n\n2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:12.580\n And so these are, like whatever the psychological needs are,\n\n2:41:12.620 --> 2:41:14.500\n like they're just our substitutes for it.\n\n2:41:14.500 --> 2:41:19.380\n So I guess like, yeah, so if we trying to say,\n\n2:41:19.380 --> 2:41:24.380\n I feel like once we start living to the age of 200,\n\n2:41:24.660 --> 2:41:27.220\n then like, I'm just intuitively expecting\n\n2:41:27.220 --> 2:41:30.860\n that we'll see substitutes emerge in the same way.\n\n2:41:31.700 --> 2:41:35.740\n Yeah, we'll create conflicts of other sorts\n\n2:41:35.740 --> 2:41:38.900\n that lead to less human suffering than wars do.\n\n2:41:38.900 --> 2:41:42.420\n Like we'll just start playing Diablo four, five, six,\n\n2:41:42.420 --> 2:41:44.180\n cause you die in video games.\n\n2:41:44.180 --> 2:41:48.460\n So maybe we'll get some of the inkling of scarcity\n\n2:41:48.460 --> 2:41:50.420\n through the activities we partake in\n\n2:41:50.420 --> 2:41:52.380\n as opposed to our own body dying.\n\n2:41:52.380 --> 2:41:55.500\n I mean, I feel shitty when I, like you can,\n\n2:41:55.500 --> 2:42:00.340\n I remember in Diablo three, you can play in hardcore mode\n\n2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:03.140\n where if you die in the game, your character's dead.\n\n2:42:03.140 --> 2:42:08.140\n Maybe we'll get the richness that we currently get from life\n\n2:42:09.500 --> 2:42:11.940\n by having like little artificial versions\n\n2:42:11.940 --> 2:42:12.940\n of ourselves that die.\n\n2:42:12.940 --> 2:42:15.780\n Interesting enough, as I've just like personally\n\n2:42:15.780 --> 2:42:18.180\n spent more time in this world, I've started realizing\n\n2:42:18.180 --> 2:42:22.020\n that there is a concept of like real finiteness\n\n2:42:22.020 --> 2:42:25.060\n that still exists and it might even still be a thing\n\n2:42:25.060 --> 2:42:27.020\n that provides meaning that doesn't require anyone\n\n2:42:27.020 --> 2:42:28.180\n to actually die.\n\n2:42:28.180 --> 2:42:32.180\n Like for example, like how many people from middle school\n\n2:42:32.180 --> 2:42:34.820\n or even high school are yours?\n\n2:42:34.820 --> 2:42:36.660\n Like do you still talk to regularly?\n\n2:42:36.660 --> 2:42:39.620\n I happen to be close friends with like four or five of them.\n\n2:42:39.620 --> 2:42:41.500\n Okay, well, like in my case, the answer is zero\n\n2:42:41.500 --> 2:42:43.060\n for middle school and two for high school.\n\n2:42:43.060 --> 2:42:43.900\n But you're right.\n\n2:42:43.900 --> 2:42:44.740\n Right.\n\n2:42:44.740 --> 2:42:45.580\n It dropped close to zero.\n\n2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:47.100\n Exactly, it dropped a lot, right?\n\n2:42:47.100 --> 2:42:50.540\n And so like there's a lot of these just like relationships\n\n2:42:50.540 --> 2:42:52.620\n that end up being very finite.\n\n2:42:52.620 --> 2:42:56.420\n A person changes their, I feel like a person changes enough\n\n2:42:56.420 --> 2:42:58.260\n of their worldview after 25 years.\n\n2:42:58.260 --> 2:42:59.620\n Was there even a study about this?\n\n2:42:59.620 --> 2:43:03.140\n Something like a person and themselves 25 years later\n\n2:43:03.140 --> 2:43:06.700\n are about as different as like two different people\n\n2:43:06.700 --> 2:43:08.020\n or something like this.\n\n2:43:08.020 --> 2:43:10.940\n So, I mean, just like you can have conflict\n\n2:43:10.940 --> 2:43:14.780\n without bloodshed, I think you can have finiteness\n\n2:43:14.780 --> 2:43:18.580\n and even the necessary sorrows of finiteness\n\n2:43:18.580 --> 2:43:21.420\n that give meaning without like literally anyone\n\n2:43:21.420 --> 2:43:22.780\n having to end their life.\n\n2:43:22.780 --> 2:43:24.660\n And hopefully if we do extend our life,\n\n2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:27.980\n we'll figure out ways to extend the period of time\n\n2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:30.340\n where there's neuroplasticity\n\n2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:33.980\n to where we could change our worldviews continually\n\n2:43:33.980 --> 2:43:34.820\n throughout that time.\n\n2:43:34.820 --> 2:43:37.660\n So you can have these different phases of life.\n\n2:43:38.860 --> 2:43:41.540\n I thought it would be fun to hear you speak a little Russian.\n\n2:43:41.540 --> 2:43:42.460\n Do you speak Russian?\n\n2:43:42.460 --> 2:43:44.260\n Yes, of course.\n\n2:43:44.260 --> 2:43:48.420\n How did your Russian roots help you?\n\n2:43:48.420 --> 2:43:50.660\n That's an interesting question.\n\n2:43:50.660 --> 2:43:52.740\n What can you say in Russian about that?\n\n2:43:52.740 --> 2:43:55.860\n What can I say about my Russian roots?\n\n2:43:55.860 --> 2:44:03.700\n When I just look at other projects,\n\n2:44:03.700 --> 2:44:07.820\n other people in the blockchain industry,\n\n2:44:07.820 --> 2:44:12.620\n sometimes when I look at what Russian people are doing,\n\n2:44:12.620 --> 2:44:14.300\n what other people are doing,\n\n2:44:14.300 --> 2:44:21.180\n I can sometimes feel that these people who are Russian\n\n2:44:21.180 --> 2:44:27.860\n have something that feels similar to me,\n\n2:44:27.860 --> 2:44:32.220\n but I don't know how to explain it.\n\n2:44:32.220 --> 2:44:35.620\n Do you think there's, so for people who don't speak Russian,\n\n2:44:35.620 --> 2:44:40.860\n that Vitalik said that there is something to the spirit\n\n2:44:40.860 --> 2:44:42.220\n of the people that are Russian\n\n2:44:42.220 --> 2:44:44.940\n that are working in the cryptocurrency world\n\n2:44:44.940 --> 2:44:46.820\n that is a little bit different\n\n2:44:46.820 --> 2:44:51.300\n and it's something that connects to some kind of aspect\n\n2:44:51.300 --> 2:44:54.500\n of your own self, some kind of roots there.\n\n2:44:54.500 --> 2:44:56.580\n And it's kind of interesting.\n\n2:44:56.580 --> 2:44:59.260\n Do you think that there's, does it make you sad\n\n2:44:59.260 --> 2:45:01.660\n that there's these two different worlds\n\n2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:07.420\n that are sort of in part disconnected by language?\n\n2:45:07.420 --> 2:45:09.820\n And I'm sure the same could be the case with China\n\n2:45:09.820 --> 2:45:11.660\n and other parts of the world,\n\n2:45:11.660 --> 2:45:17.140\n where the language slows the transmission of the beauty\n\n2:45:17.140 --> 2:45:19.340\n of the culture in a certain kind of way\n\n2:45:19.340 --> 2:45:21.380\n where you can't truly collaborate.\n\n2:45:21.380 --> 2:45:23.180\n Like you can all speak English,\n\n2:45:23.180 --> 2:45:25.820\n so you're collaborating on maybe a technical level,\n\n2:45:25.820 --> 2:45:28.380\n but you're not collaborating on the level\n\n2:45:28.380 --> 2:45:30.660\n of some deep human connection.\n\n2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:34.140\n Do you see that being able to speak both languages?\n\n2:45:34.140 --> 2:45:35.860\n There's definitely benefits, I think,\n\n2:45:35.860 --> 2:45:38.980\n to be able to speak multiple languages.\n\n2:45:38.980 --> 2:45:44.980\n And once you can, you discover that even your mindset changes\n\n2:45:44.980 --> 2:45:47.660\n while you're speaking in one language versus the other.\n\n2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:50.460\n People have told me this, like, when I speak Russian,\n\n2:45:50.460 --> 2:45:54.380\n I sound more, I guess, to the point and pragmatic.\n\n2:45:54.380 --> 2:45:56.420\n When I speak Chinese, I sound more cute.\n\n2:45:56.420 --> 2:46:00.940\n When I speak English, I'm something else.\n\n2:46:00.940 --> 2:46:06.980\n I guess there's definitely a richness that you're missing\n\n2:46:06.980 --> 2:46:10.580\n if you're only in one of these language bubbles.\n\n2:46:10.580 --> 2:46:14.940\n But I guess the arguments on the other side would be that\n\n2:46:14.940 --> 2:46:16.540\n if everyone spoke the same language,\n\n2:46:16.540 --> 2:46:19.300\n then there would just be one bubble.\n\n2:46:19.300 --> 2:46:22.500\n This is the challenge, I think.\n\n2:46:22.500 --> 2:46:25.660\n There are actually benefits to having cultural diversity,\n\n2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:27.540\n and you definitely don't want the entire world\n\n2:46:27.540 --> 2:46:30.180\n to be too conformist.\n\n2:46:30.180 --> 2:46:31.780\n Well, one of the interesting things about crypto\n\n2:46:31.780 --> 2:46:34.780\n is that it's just a culture that actually manages\n\n2:46:34.780 --> 2:46:40.180\n to somehow have its uniqueness and even preserve its independence\n\n2:46:40.180 --> 2:46:42.940\n from all of these surrounding countries\n\n2:46:42.940 --> 2:46:44.980\n despite being embedded in all of them.\n\n2:46:44.980 --> 2:46:48.780\n So it spans outside of the geographic boundaries,\n\n2:46:48.780 --> 2:46:51.020\n and language in some ways does as well.\n\n2:46:51.020 --> 2:46:54.500\n And the way these cultures, these bubbles are created,\n\n2:46:54.500 --> 2:46:56.300\n I mean, they overlap in interesting ways.\n\n2:46:56.300 --> 2:46:57.420\n It's almost like a hierarchy,\n\n2:46:57.420 --> 2:47:00.020\n and the same is the case of the crypto world.\n\n2:47:00.020 --> 2:47:03.460\n There's communities associated with these cryptocurrencies.\n\n2:47:03.460 --> 2:47:06.900\n There's communities within those communities, and it's...\n\n2:47:06.900 --> 2:47:09.460\n Yeah, I mean, I think it's definitely sad\n\n2:47:09.460 --> 2:47:13.420\n whenever these groups are fighting each other,\n\n2:47:13.420 --> 2:47:19.780\n and it's definitely good for them if people can cooperate more.\n\n2:47:19.780 --> 2:47:24.460\n But at the same time, just having groups of people\n\n2:47:24.460 --> 2:47:27.740\n that have different kinds of life experiences,\n\n2:47:27.740 --> 2:47:30.260\n there's definitely something to benefit from that.\n\n2:47:30.260 --> 2:47:31.940\n So let me ask one last question.\n\n2:47:31.940 --> 2:47:33.780\n I don't think I asked you last time\n\n2:47:33.780 --> 2:47:37.140\n the ridiculous question about the meaning of life.\n\n2:47:37.140 --> 2:47:38.380\n You know, Dostoevsky said,\n\n2:47:38.380 --> 2:47:40.100\n beauty will save the world.\n\n2:47:40.100 --> 2:47:43.820\n Krasata spacet mir.\n\n2:47:43.820 --> 2:47:46.740\n Some people believe money is a big part of happiness,\n\n2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:48.860\n and you've turned...\n\n2:47:48.860 --> 2:47:50.340\n First of all, you've made a lot of money.\n\n2:47:50.340 --> 2:47:51.820\n You turned away a lot of money.\n\n2:47:51.820 --> 2:47:53.860\n You turned away a lot of power.\n\n2:47:53.860 --> 2:47:56.220\n So you're a fascinating person to ask,\n\n2:47:56.220 --> 2:47:59.580\n what do you think is meaning to life?\n\n2:47:59.580 --> 2:48:01.300\n The thing that I've realized with money\n\n2:48:01.300 --> 2:48:05.460\n as I have experienced both having little of it\n\n2:48:05.460 --> 2:48:12.300\n and having a lot of it is that the benefit of...\n\n2:48:12.300 --> 2:48:15.580\n You can get the most out of money if you think of it\n\n2:48:15.580 --> 2:48:18.740\n not as something that lets you do and have more things,\n\n2:48:18.740 --> 2:48:22.780\n but as something that lets you worry about fewer things, right?\n\n2:48:22.780 --> 2:48:28.300\n Like, if your savings are just nonzero at all,\n\n2:48:28.300 --> 2:48:31.220\n then you don't have to worry as much about losing your job.\n\n2:48:31.220 --> 2:48:35.020\n And if you feel like you have a job\n\n2:48:35.020 --> 2:48:36.900\n that just really conflicts with your values,\n\n2:48:36.900 --> 2:48:39.020\n then if you have even six months saved up,\n\n2:48:39.020 --> 2:48:40.420\n that just makes it easier for you to say,\n\n2:48:40.420 --> 2:48:42.620\n bye bye, I'm going to do something else.\n\n2:48:42.620 --> 2:48:49.620\n If you have more money, then you can not worry about\n\n2:48:49.620 --> 2:48:53.620\n even what you're doing needing to be profitable at all.\n\n2:48:53.620 --> 2:48:59.180\n Once you get more money, then you can choose transportation options\n\n2:48:59.180 --> 2:49:02.420\n and food options that just have less hassle in your life\n\n2:49:02.420 --> 2:49:04.300\n and allow you to be lazier.\n\n2:49:04.300 --> 2:49:11.340\n So, this aspect of just reducing troubles\n\n2:49:11.340 --> 2:49:16.180\n and opening up room for other things, I think, is a big part of it.\n\n2:49:16.180 --> 2:49:20.140\n If you instead think of money as being this positive\n\n2:49:20.140 --> 2:49:22.380\n or this thing that gives you stuff\n\n2:49:22.380 --> 2:49:25.740\n and you try to derive meaning from the stuff,\n\n2:49:25.740 --> 2:49:32.260\n I think that's much more likely to be a road to basically squandering that opportunity.\n\n2:49:32.260 --> 2:49:38.380\n So, yeah, and I guess my philosophy on that is definitely more subtractive than additive there.\n\n2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:41.660\n But once you have enough money that you don't have to worry about the money,\n\n2:49:41.660 --> 2:49:45.980\n you're burdened with another question, which is of meaning.\n\n2:49:45.980 --> 2:49:47.900\n Do you think there's meaning to it all?\n\n2:49:47.900 --> 2:49:51.660\n Or it seems like your own life,\n\n2:49:51.660 --> 2:49:59.220\n you're trying to build cool stuff that alleviates some level of suffering in the world.\n\n2:49:59.220 --> 2:50:02.380\n Well, I mean, one way to think about it is like,\n\n2:50:02.380 --> 2:50:06.540\n think back to how you thought about life when you were in school, right?\n\n2:50:06.540 --> 2:50:09.020\n In school, this act is interesting to think about, right?\n\n2:50:09.020 --> 2:50:16.300\n Because in a lot of ways, it's just totally outside of bounds of the kinds of systems,\n\n2:50:16.300 --> 2:50:19.460\n like social systems that we live in as adults,\n\n2:50:19.460 --> 2:50:23.540\n or maybe not, like maybe things like academia are intended to replicate parts of school.\n\n2:50:23.540 --> 2:50:26.180\n Like, first of all, school is very totalitarian, right?\n\n2:50:26.180 --> 2:50:30.500\n Like, you have to follow the teacher's instructions,\n\n2:50:30.500 --> 2:50:33.780\n the bulk of your schedule is like forced to be in particular areas,\n\n2:50:33.780 --> 2:50:43.420\n and you can control the real purview from leaving the grounds during this period of time,\n\n2:50:43.420 --> 2:50:45.180\n assign a lot of homework.\n\n2:50:45.180 --> 2:50:50.220\n But at the same time, also, school is a bit of a post scarcity utopia\n\n2:50:50.220 --> 2:50:53.500\n in that you just don't have to worry about getting resources for yourself.\n\n2:50:53.500 --> 2:50:57.660\n And we've both lived through 12 years of that, right?\n\n2:50:57.660 --> 2:50:59.580\n So, what does that say about us?\n\n2:50:59.580 --> 2:51:10.700\n And I think one thing of aspects, obviously, is that there's definitely an easiness to living life\n\n2:51:10.700 --> 2:51:12.940\n if all of your decisions are made for you.\n\n2:51:12.940 --> 2:51:20.140\n And one of the challenges of adulthood, I guess, is moving to this world\n\n2:51:20.140 --> 2:51:22.860\n where all your choices are much more self directed,\n\n2:51:22.860 --> 2:51:26.540\n and you just have to learn to live and deal with that.\n\n2:51:26.540 --> 2:51:30.380\n Yeah, dealing with the burden of freedom, in some sense.\n\n2:51:30.380 --> 2:51:38.780\n It's actually interesting, because in some ways, I feel like even my first five years\n\n2:51:38.780 --> 2:51:43.420\n of doing Ethereum things, my life was not even all that self directed,\n\n2:51:43.420 --> 2:51:47.420\n because a lot of it was just responding to obligations.\n\n2:51:47.420 --> 2:51:51.020\n Like someone said, oh, come to speak at this event in Korea.\n\n2:51:51.020 --> 2:51:52.940\n Okay, come to speak at this thing in Taiwan.\n\n2:51:52.940 --> 2:51:53.440\n Okay.\n\n2:51:55.660 --> 2:52:00.780\n For Ethereum to launch, we need this particular piece to be done and tested.\n\n2:52:00.780 --> 2:52:01.820\n Okay, work on that.\n\n2:52:01.820 --> 2:52:05.820\n We need some proof of stake algorithm, work on that.\n\n2:52:05.820 --> 2:52:14.300\n And the last year of COVID life, basically, I was holed up in Singapore for much of it.\n\n2:52:14.300 --> 2:52:16.620\n And it gave me a lot more alone time.\n\n2:52:16.620 --> 2:52:18.060\n I had much less travel.\n\n2:52:18.060 --> 2:52:21.500\n And that was definitely a very new and interesting experience for me.\n\n2:52:21.500 --> 2:52:31.180\n Would you characterize it by sadness, melancholy, hope, dreaming, innovative period?\n\n2:52:31.180 --> 2:52:33.260\n How would you characterize that alone time?\n\n2:52:33.260 --> 2:52:36.220\n Some of all five, definitely some self discovery.\n\n2:52:37.260 --> 2:52:43.420\n I definitely did make this very deliberate decision that, okay, I have this time,\n\n2:52:43.420 --> 2:52:48.780\n and I'm going to actually make something meaningful out of it.\n\n2:52:48.780 --> 2:52:52.780\n So one example of the things I did is I just actually started\n\n2:52:53.980 --> 2:52:56.860\n listening to your audio books and podcasts much more.\n\n2:52:57.580 --> 2:53:02.700\n Just this year, I basically discovered that the podcast space is real for the first time,\n\n2:53:02.700 --> 2:53:03.500\n I guess.\n\n2:53:03.500 --> 2:53:06.300\n Like before that, there would be things that I would get interviewed for,\n\n2:53:06.300 --> 2:53:16.220\n but I was not mentally incorporate this idea that podcasts are a thing that you can go listen to.\n\n2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:17.020\n And this year I did.\n\n2:53:17.660 --> 2:53:24.380\n My friend, Carl Lafleur, one of the optimism people, recommended hardcore history to me.\n\n2:53:24.380 --> 2:53:27.260\n And so I went ahead and just listened to all the hardcore histories.\n\n2:53:27.260 --> 2:53:32.940\n And then after that, I listened to like 10 Luxfried mids and then a bunch of others.\n\n2:53:32.940 --> 2:53:36.700\n And after that, I also got into audio books.\n\n2:53:37.740 --> 2:53:43.660\n Oh, I listened to the entire The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, the whole thing, 45 hours.\n\n2:53:44.460 --> 2:53:45.580\n That was fascinating.\n\n2:53:45.580 --> 2:53:48.540\n So let me ask about Dan, because Dan is going to love hearing this.\n\n2:53:48.540 --> 2:53:50.460\n I'm going to send it to him.\n\n2:53:50.460 --> 2:53:54.220\n Do you have a period of history, whether it's Dan or in general,\n\n2:53:54.220 --> 2:53:58.060\n that you draw for your own life, like kind of thinking about the world,\n\n2:53:58.060 --> 2:53:59.900\n about human nature that you go to?\n\n2:53:59.900 --> 2:54:01.100\n Is it World War II?\n\n2:54:01.100 --> 2:54:04.940\n Is it Wrath of the Khans, the Genghis Khan?\n\n2:54:05.420 --> 2:54:08.380\n Is it some other more ancient history?\n\n2:54:08.380 --> 2:54:09.660\n Is it World War I?\n\n2:54:09.660 --> 2:54:15.900\n Is there something that kind of echoes with you in the voice of Dan or anyone else that you connect to?\n\n2:54:16.460 --> 2:54:21.660\n I feel like the 1930s and 40s are fascinating because they force you to really grapple with\n\n2:54:21.660 --> 2:54:25.100\n the question of where does evil come from, right?\n\n2:54:25.100 --> 2:54:31.100\n The sort of mental puzzle that I've always had in my head is, on the one hand,\n\n2:54:31.740 --> 2:54:33.660\n things like the Holocaust happened.\n\n2:54:33.660 --> 2:54:38.140\n But on the other hand, if you just go and have a coffee with people,\n\n2:54:38.140 --> 2:54:41.180\n then a hundred times out of a hundred, everyone just seems so nice.\n\n2:54:41.180 --> 2:54:43.900\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:54:43.900 --> 2:54:47.580\n How do you kind of reconcile the macro and the micro there, right?\n\n2:54:47.580 --> 2:54:56.540\n And that's the sort of thing that's very difficult if you don't have a lot of,\n\n2:54:56.540 --> 2:54:58.940\n I guess, the right kind of personal experience,\n\n2:54:58.940 --> 2:55:03.340\n especially if your personal experience starts off being sheltered, like it was for me, right?\n\n2:55:03.340 --> 2:55:07.980\n I know the stereotype is that the nerds get bullied in school, but actually for me,\n\n2:55:07.980 --> 2:55:11.020\n in my school experience was just being treated with kindness by everyone.\n\n2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:11.520\n Yeah.\n\n2:55:12.220 --> 2:55:15.820\n So that definitely made it harder to understand things.\n\n2:55:15.820 --> 2:55:19.580\n I remember actually being pretty blindsided when I started Ethereum.\n\n2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:24.460\n And then within six months, there started being fights over who would get more shares\n\n2:55:24.460 --> 2:55:26.460\n if Ethereum turned out to be a company.\n\n2:55:26.460 --> 2:55:29.100\n And then I suggested we should just make it to be a non profit,\n\n2:55:29.100 --> 2:55:30.860\n and somehow that ended up upsetting people.\n\n2:55:34.860 --> 2:55:40.620\n So the fascinating thing for me is that I've been obviously reading and listening to the history,\n\n2:55:40.620 --> 2:55:45.020\n and then at the same time, just observing things happening in the crypto world.\n\n2:55:45.020 --> 2:55:55.580\n And so one of my interesting mental intuitions that I've gotten is that I think most evil\n\n2:55:55.580 --> 2:55:57.740\n doesn't come out of greed, it comes out of fear.\n\n2:55:58.700 --> 2:56:08.220\n And one example of this in Ethereum lands, right, is I think the part of Ethereum history\n\n2:56:08.220 --> 2:56:10.460\n where I thought that the Ethereum community was at its lowest,\n\n2:56:10.460 --> 2:56:12.540\n and even when I personally was at my lowest.\n\n2:56:12.540 --> 2:56:17.820\n Now, if you go back to the Dow fork in 2016, right, so the Dow hack happened,\n\n2:56:17.820 --> 2:56:20.780\n and then we made this controversial decision to change the Ethereum protocol.\n\n2:56:21.980 --> 2:56:28.300\n And then there was that Ethereum Classic split.\n\n2:56:28.300 --> 2:56:34.860\n And as soon as that Ethereum Classic split happened, there was a lot of anger everywhere.\n\n2:56:34.860 --> 2:56:41.420\n And there started especially being anger when the price of ETC started taking up.\n\n2:56:41.420 --> 2:56:46.860\n So this was the time when Ether started off being $13 and Ethereum Classic started at zero,\n\n2:56:46.860 --> 2:56:50.780\n but then suddenly there was this one day when like ETH dropped to 12.5,\n\n2:56:50.780 --> 2:56:54.300\n ETC went up to 0.5, and then they dropped more.\n\n2:56:55.100 --> 2:56:56.860\n And people were saying things like,\n\n2:56:57.980 --> 2:57:03.900\n oh, this whole Ethereum Classic is just a psyop by the Bitcoin community\n\n2:57:03.900 --> 2:57:06.300\n and just the wealthy Bitcoiners trying to destroy Ethereum.\n\n2:57:06.860 --> 2:57:11.020\n And in the back of my mind, I knew that that wasn't entirely true.\n\n2:57:11.020 --> 2:57:12.460\n There definitely were Bitcoiners.\n\n2:57:12.460 --> 2:57:20.860\n But at the same time, I think blaming disagreements on foreign interference,\n\n2:57:20.860 --> 2:57:25.180\n like this is the sort of thing that countries, governments do all the time,\n\n2:57:25.820 --> 2:57:31.260\n it's a very convenient excuse because it allows you to just blame these things\n\n2:57:31.260 --> 2:57:36.380\n that are happening on the foreigners and avoid actually grappling with the facts that like,\n\n2:57:36.380 --> 2:57:38.860\n well, no, actually you have people in your very own community\n\n2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:41.100\n who just disagree with you and have a different belief.\n\n2:57:41.660 --> 2:57:46.540\n And I feel like the Ethereum community during that time\n\n2:57:46.540 --> 2:57:48.780\n did not do a very good job of grappling with that.\n\n2:57:48.780 --> 2:57:52.940\n And I feel like I during that time did not do a very good job of grappling with that.\n\n2:57:52.940 --> 2:57:56.060\n And so there was a lot of blaming the Bitcoiners.\n\n2:57:56.060 --> 2:58:00.460\n There were also even a lot of people calling for us to use trademark law\n\n2:58:00.460 --> 2:58:05.660\n and basically sue exchanges and try to prevent them from listing Ethereum Classic.\n\n2:58:05.660 --> 2:58:07.500\n And to me, that was very unethical, right?\n\n2:58:07.500 --> 2:58:17.180\n Like basically using the government as a weapon to try to attack the other cryptocurrency\n\n2:58:17.180 --> 2:58:21.420\n and destroy it goes completely against the ideals of freedom\n\n2:58:21.420 --> 2:58:24.860\n and things that at least in theory were supposed to stand for.\n\n2:58:25.580 --> 2:58:32.700\n But in that particular time, basically what was happening was that the ETC price was rising.\n\n2:58:32.700 --> 2:58:36.060\n And at the same time, the ETH price was dropping in lockstep.\n\n2:58:36.060 --> 2:58:40.140\n And there were a lot of Bitcoin people basically saying this is the end of Ethereum.\n\n2:58:40.140 --> 2:58:42.780\n And I think a lot of people really were afraid that\n\n2:58:42.780 --> 2:58:45.900\n Ethereum would be just like completely destroyed as a result of this.\n\n2:58:45.900 --> 2:58:48.700\n And so that's where the anger came from.\n\n2:58:48.700 --> 2:58:50.300\n Exactly. Yeah, exactly.\n\n2:58:50.300 --> 2:58:51.260\n It came from the fear.\n\n2:58:51.260 --> 2:58:56.940\n And that's what allowed people to rationalize in abandonment of principles\n\n2:58:56.940 --> 2:59:01.740\n that I think they would not have accepted in other circumstances.\n\n2:59:01.740 --> 2:59:06.700\n And I definitely, to some extent, played along with this myself.\n\n2:59:06.700 --> 2:59:10.060\n And I do definitely regret that to some extent.\n\n2:59:10.060 --> 2:59:14.140\n Well, I definitely regret the excesses completely.\n\n2:59:17.020 --> 2:59:21.580\n And then obviously, Bitcoin block size war, similar sort of stuff happened.\n\n2:59:21.580 --> 2:59:30.700\n So that insight was interesting because it does mentally make a lot of sense\n\n2:59:30.700 --> 2:59:34.220\n when you're actually afraid that unless you act in some way\n\n2:59:34.220 --> 2:59:36.300\n that your entire world is going to collapse.\n\n2:59:36.300 --> 2:59:39.820\n It's much easier to just rationalize forgetting your principles\n\n2:59:39.820 --> 2:59:43.340\n and doing whatever you have to just save the specific thing that you care about.\n\n2:59:44.140 --> 2:59:50.940\n It feels like the right thing to do, the brave thing to do is in the face of fear\n\n2:59:51.660 --> 2:59:56.780\n to still have compassion, to still have love as opposed to hate.\n\n2:59:56.780 --> 3:00:01.500\n So the darkest moments, the toughest moments of human history\n\n3:00:01.500 --> 3:00:03.900\n are those where fear is everywhere.\n\n3:00:04.700 --> 3:00:14.860\n And despite that, the way to get out of that is through love, not giving into the fear.\n\n3:00:14.860 --> 3:00:18.780\n And again, that's the lesson that you draw from all those moments of history.\n\n3:00:20.540 --> 3:00:21.040\n Yeah.\n\n3:00:21.660 --> 3:00:26.060\n Well, I like you have in terms of those coffee and the kindness that people have,\n\n3:00:26.060 --> 3:00:29.340\n it does seem that everybody has the capacity for evil\n\n3:00:29.340 --> 3:00:31.500\n and everybody has the capacity for love.\n\n3:00:31.500 --> 3:00:34.460\n And you just have to create mechanisms and incentives\n\n3:00:35.100 --> 3:00:37.820\n that prioritize the latter over the former.\n\n3:00:38.380 --> 3:00:42.460\n Vitalik, you're one of the most interesting people I've gotten a chance to talk to.\n\n3:00:44.060 --> 3:00:45.580\n Thank you so much for talking to me.\n\n3:00:45.580 --> 3:00:47.500\n I hope we get a chance to talk again.\n\n3:00:47.500 --> 3:00:50.220\n I hope I can at least be some small part.\n\n3:00:50.220 --> 3:00:53.340\n This would be awesome in a podcast with you and Dan Carlin.\n\n3:00:53.340 --> 3:00:56.380\n That would be an awesome conversation.\n\n3:00:56.380 --> 3:01:01.100\n Thank you so much for doing so much incredible technical innovation\n\n3:01:01.820 --> 3:01:05.900\n that inspires the computer scientists, the economists,\n\n3:01:05.900 --> 3:01:08.860\n inspires the world and what technology can do.\n\n3:01:08.860 --> 3:01:14.620\n And now with longevity, I do hope we live a very long time\n\n3:01:14.620 --> 3:01:19.580\n and play Diablo to make that long time fun.\n\n3:01:19.580 --> 3:01:20.860\n Thank you so much for talking today.\n\n3:01:20.860 --> 3:01:21.580\n Thank you too, Alex.\n\n3:01:21.580 --> 3:01:23.260\n This was great.\n\n3:01:23.260 --> 3:01:26.060\n Thanks for listening to this conversation with Vitalik Buterin\n\n3:01:26.060 --> 3:01:29.420\n and thank you to Athletic Greens, Magic Spoon,\n\n3:01:29.420 --> 3:01:32.860\n Indeed, Four Sigmatic and BetterHelp.\n\n3:01:32.860 --> 3:01:35.580\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n3:01:36.620 --> 3:01:39.900\n And now let me leave you with some words from Nelson Mandela.\n\n3:01:40.780 --> 3:01:44.540\n When a man is denied the right to live the life he believes in,\n\n3:01:44.540 --> 3:01:47.820\n he has no choice but to become an outlaw.\n\n3:01:47.820 --> 3:01:50.940\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
