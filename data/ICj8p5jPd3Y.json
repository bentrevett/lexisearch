--> 00:08.920\n at John Hopkins, and is one of the top scientists\n\n00:08.920 --> 00:13.360\n in the world conducting seminal research on psychedelics.\n\n00:13.360 --> 00:15.760\n This was one of the most eye opening\n\n00:15.760 --> 00:19.880\n and fascinating conversations I've ever had on this podcast.\n\n00:19.880 --> 00:22.540\n I'm sure I'll talk with Matt many more times.\n\n00:22.540 --> 00:25.120\n Quick mention of a sponsor followed by some thoughts\n\n00:25.120 --> 00:26.640\n related to the episode.\n\n00:26.640 --> 00:30.040\n Thank you to a new sponsor, Brave,\n\n00:30.040 --> 00:32.240\n a fast browser that feels like Chrome\n\n00:32.240 --> 00:35.400\n but has more privacy preserving features.\n\n00:35.400 --> 00:39.020\n Neuro, the maker of functional sugar free gum and mints\n\n00:39.020 --> 00:42.640\n that I use to give my brain a quick caffeine boost.\n\n00:42.640 --> 00:46.760\n Four Sigmatic, the maker of delicious mushroom coffee,\n\n00:46.760 --> 00:50.760\n I'm just now realizing how ironic the set of sponsors are.\n\n00:50.760 --> 00:54.720\n And Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends.\n\n00:54.720 --> 00:56.920\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n00:56.920 --> 01:00.220\n to get a discount and support this podcast.\n\n01:00.220 --> 01:02.620\n As a side note, let me say that psychedelics\n\n01:02.620 --> 01:05.720\n is an area of study that is fascinating to me\n\n01:05.720 --> 01:08.200\n in that it gives hints that much of the magic\n\n01:08.200 --> 01:10.640\n of our experience arises from just a few\n\n01:10.640 --> 01:12.480\n chemical interactions in the brain\n\n01:12.480 --> 01:16.080\n and that the nature of that experience can be expanded\n\n01:16.080 --> 01:19.640\n through the tools of biology, chemistry, physics,\n\n01:19.640 --> 01:23.320\n neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.\n\n01:23.320 --> 01:26.160\n The fact that a world class scientist and researcher\n\n01:26.160 --> 01:28.800\n like Matt can apply rigor to our study\n\n01:28.800 --> 01:31.720\n of this mysterious and fascinating topic\n\n01:31.720 --> 01:34.200\n is exciting to me beyond words.\n\n01:34.200 --> 01:36.440\n As is the case with any of my colleagues\n\n01:36.440 --> 01:38.880\n who dare to venture out into the darkness\n\n01:38.880 --> 01:41.680\n of all that is unknown about the human mind\n\n01:41.680 --> 01:44.920\n with both an openness of first principle thinking\n\n01:44.920 --> 01:47.880\n and the rigor of the scientific method.\n\n01:47.880 --> 01:49.960\n If you enjoy this

psychedelics,\n\n02:05.920 --> 02:08.760\n like a whirlwind overview?\n\n02:08.760 --> 02:11.680\n Maybe what are psychedelics\n\n02:11.680 --> 02:14.560\n and what are the kinds of psychedelics out there\n\n02:14.560 --> 02:17.580\n and in whatever way you find meaningful to categorize?\n\n02:17.580 --> 02:22.580\n Yeah, you can categorize them by their chemical structure.\n\n02:23.160 --> 02:27.500\n So, phenethylamines, tryptamines, ergolines,\n\n02:29.160 --> 02:33.880\n that is less of a meaningful way to classify them.\n\n02:33.880 --> 02:36.700\n I think that their pharmacological activity,\n\n02:36.700 --> 02:39.340\n their receptor activities are the best way.\n\n02:39.340 --> 02:40.920\n Well, let me start even broader than that\n\n02:40.920 --> 02:43.640\n because there I'm talking about the classic psychedelics.\n\n02:43.640 --> 02:47.920\n So, broadly speaking, when we say psychedelic,\n\n02:47.920 --> 02:50.240\n that refers to, for most people,\n\n02:50.240 --> 02:52.260\n a broad number of compounds\n\n02:52.260 --> 02:54.960\n that work in different pharmacological ways.\n\n02:54.960 --> 02:58.200\n So, it includes the so called classic psychedelics.\n\n02:59.080 --> 03:03.040\n That includes psilocybin and psilocin,\n\n03:03.040 --> 03:08.040\n which are in mushrooms, LSD, dimethyltryptamine or DMT,\n\n03:08.360 --> 03:10.840\n it's in ayahuasca, people can smoke it too,\n\n03:10.840 --> 03:15.580\n mescaline, which is in peyote in San Pedro, cactus.\n\n03:17.700 --> 03:20.880\n And those all work by hitting a certain\n\n03:20.880 --> 03:24.500\n subtype of serotonin receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor.\n\n03:24.500 --> 03:27.200\n They act as agonists at that receptor.\n\n03:28.560 --> 03:33.560\n Other compounds like PCP, ketamine, MDMA, ibogaine,\n\n03:36.000 --> 03:40.060\n they all are more broadly speaking called psychedelics,\n\n03:40.060 --> 03:45.060\n but they work by very different ways pharmacologically.\n\n03:45.720 --> 03:48.200\n And they have some different effects,\n\n03:48.200 --> 03:49.660\n including some subjective effects,\n\n03:49.660 --> 03:53.140\n even though there's enough of an overlap\n\n03:53.140 --> 03:56.460\n in the subjective effects that, you know,\n\n03:56.460 --> 03:59.160\n people informally refer to them as psychedelic.\n\n03:59.160 --> 04:01.320\n And I think what that overlap is, you know,\n\n04:01.320 --> 04:04.320\n compared to say, you know, caffeine and cocaine\n\n04:04.320 --> 04:08.680\n and, you know, Ambien, et cetera, other psychoactive drugs\n\n04:08.680 --> 04:11.400\n is that they have strong effects\n\n04:11.400 --> 04:15.960\n in altering one's sense of reality\n\n04:15.960 --> 04:18.040\n and including the sense of self.\n\n04:18.040 --> 04:20.660\n And I should throw in there that cannabis,\n\n04:20.660 --> 04:22.440\n more historically, like in the 70s,\n\n04:22.440 --> 04:24.040\n has been called a minor psychedelic.\n\n04:24.040 --> 04:25.780\n And I think with that latter definition,\n\n04:25.780 --> 04:28.080\n it does fit that definition,\n\n04:28.080 --> 04:30.460\n particularly if one doesn't have a tolerance.\n\n04:30.460 --> 04:34.040\n So you mentioned serotonin, so most of the effect\n\n04:34.040 --> 04:36.960\n comes from something around like the chemistry\n\n04:36.960 --> 04:39.000\n around neurotransmitters and so on.\n\n04:39.000 --> 04:42.800\n So it's chemical interactions in the brain,\n\n04:42.800 --> 04:44.600\n or is there other kinds of interactions\n\n04:44.600 --> 04:47.880\n that have this kind of perception\n\n04:47.880 --> 04:51.300\n and self awareness altering effects?\n\n04:51.300 --> 04:54.600\n Well, as far as we know, all of the psychedelics\n\n04:54.600 --> 04:58.800\n of all the different classes we've talked about,\n\n05:00.500 --> 05:04.640\n their major activity is caused by receptor level events.\n\n05:04.640 --> 05:09.640\n So either acting at the post receptor side of the synapse.\n\n05:10.200 --> 05:12.240\n So in other words, neurotransmission operates\n\n05:12.240 --> 05:16.640\n by, you know, one neuron releasing neurotransmitter\n\n05:16.640 --> 05:19.240\n into a synapse, a gap between the two neurons.\n\n05:19.240 --> 05:23.080\n And then the other neuron receives,\n\n05:23.080 --> 05:24.680\n it has receptors that receives,\n\n05:24.680 --> 05:28.600\n and then there can be an activation caused by that.\n\n05:28.600 --> 05:30.240\n So it's like a pitcher and a catcher.\n\n05:30.240 --> 05:32.920\n So all of the major psychedelics work\n\n05:32.920 --> 05:34.640\n by either acting as a pitcher,\n\n05:34.640 --> 05:38.760\n mimicking a pitcher or a catcher.\n\n05:38.760 --> 05:41.400\n So for example, the classic psychedelics,\n\n05:41.400 --> 05:44.400\n they fit into the same catcher's mitt\n\n05:44.400 --> 05:48.440\n on the post receptor, post synaptic receptor side\n\n05:48.440 --> 05:50.200\n as serotonin itself.\n\n05:50.200 --> 05:53.520\n But they do a slightly different thing to the cell,\n\n05:53.520 --> 05:56.400\n to the neuron than serotonin does.\n\n05:56.400 --> 05:58.240\n There's a different signaling pathway\n\n05:58.240 --> 06:00.420\n after that initial activation.\n\n06:00.420 --> 06:04.840\n Something like MDMA works at the presynaptic side,\n\n06:04.840 --> 06:06.560\n the pitcher side.\n\n06:06.560 --> 06:09.240\n And basically it floods the synapse or the gap\n\n06:09.240 --> 06:11.000\n between the cells with a bunch of serotonin,\n\n06:11.000 --> 06:14.200\n the natural neurotransmitter.\n\n06:14.200 --> 06:16.280\n So it's like the pitcher in a baseball game\n\n06:16.280 --> 06:17.840\n all of a sudden just starts throwing balls\n\n06:17.840 --> 06:20.380\n like every second.\n\n06:20.380 --> 06:24.760\n Everything we're talking about is it often more natural,\n\n06:24.760 --> 06:27.680\n meaning found in the natural world.\n\n06:27.680 --> 06:31.000\n You mentioned cacti, cactus,\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.200\n or is it chemically manufactured,\n\n06:33.200 --> 06:35.540\n like artificially in the lab?\n\n06:35.540 --> 06:38.560\n So the classic psychedelics, there's...\n\n06:38.560 --> 06:39.760\n What are the classics?\n\n06:39.760 --> 06:44.360\n So using terminology that's not chemical terminology,\n\n06:44.360 --> 06:47.220\n not like the terminology you see in titles of papers,\n\n06:47.220 --> 06:50.160\n academic papers, but more sort of common parlance.\n\n06:50.160 --> 06:53.600\n Right, it would be good to kind of define their effects,\n\n06:53.600 --> 06:54.880\n like how they're different.\n\n06:54.880 --> 06:57.520\n And so it includes LSD, psilocybin,\n\n06:57.520 --> 07:00.720\n which is in mushrooms, mescaline, DMT.\n\n07:00.720 --> 07:01.880\n Which one is mescaline?\n\n07:01.880 --> 07:04.160\n Mescaline is in the different cacti.\n\n07:04.160 --> 07:07.320\n So the one most people will know is peyote,\n\n07:07.320 --> 07:10.960\n but it also shows up in San Pedro or Peruvian torch.\n\n07:10.960 --> 07:14.320\n And all of these classic psychedelics,\n\n07:14.320 --> 07:17.240\n they have, at the right dose,\n\n07:17.240 --> 07:20.640\n and typically they have very strong effects\n\n07:20.640 --> 07:23.400\n on one sense of reality and one sense of self.\n\n07:25.080 --> 07:26.480\n Some of the things that makes them different\n\n07:26.480 --> 07:29.360\n than other more broadly speaking psychedelics,\n\n07:29.360 --> 07:32.000\n like MDMA and others,\n\n07:32.000 --> 07:35.760\n is that they're, at least the major examples,\n\n07:35.760 --> 07:37.420\n there's some exotic ones that differ,\n\n07:37.420 --> 07:40.100\n but the ones I've talked about are extremely safe\n\n07:40.100 --> 07:42.120\n at the physiological level.\n\n07:42.120 --> 07:46.040\n Like LSD and psilocybin, there's no known lethal overdose,\n\n07:46.040 --> 07:50.400\n unless you have like really severe heart disease,\n\n07:50.400 --> 07:52.120\n because it modestly raises your blood pressure.\n\n07:52.120 --> 07:54.780\n So same person that might be hurt traveling snow\n\n07:54.780 --> 07:59.780\n or going up the stairs, that could have a cardiac event\n\n08:00.320 --> 08:03.040\n because they've taken one of these drugs.\n\n08:03.040 --> 08:05.760\n But for most people, someone could take a thousand times\n\n08:05.760 --> 08:06.840\n what the effective dose is,\n\n08:06.840 --> 08:09.480\n and it's not gonna cause any organ damage,\n\n08:09.480 --> 08:11.400\n affect the brainstem, make them stop breathing.\n\n08:11.400 --> 08:16.040\n So in that sense, they're freakishly safe at the physiolo...\n\n08:16.040 --> 08:18.000\n I would never call any compounds safe,\n\n08:18.000 --> 08:19.600\n because there's always a risk.\n\n08:19.600 --> 08:22.200\n They're freakishly safe at the physiological level.\n\n08:22.200 --> 08:24.720\n I mean, you can hardly find anything over the counter\n\n08:24.720 --> 08:26.240\n like that, I mean, aspirin's not like that.\n\n08:26.240 --> 08:28.080\n Caffeine is not like that.\n\n08:28.080 --> 08:33.080\n Most drugs, you take five, 10, 20, maybe it takes 100,\n\n08:33.400 --> 08:36.120\n but you get to some times the effective dose,\n\n08:36.120 --> 08:38.680\n and it's gonna kill you or cause some serious damage.\n\n08:38.680 --> 08:41.080\n And so that's something that's remarkable\n\n08:41.080 --> 08:43.840\n about most of these classic psychedelics.\n\n08:43.840 --> 08:45.020\n That's incredible, by the way,\n\n08:45.020 --> 08:48.460\n that you can go on a hell of a journey in the mind,\n\n08:48.460 --> 08:52.580\n like probably transformative,\n\n08:52.580 --> 08:56.740\n potentially in a deeply transformative way,\n\n08:56.740 --> 08:59.240\n and yet there's no dose\n\n08:59.240 --> 09:02.540\n that in most people would have a lethal effect.\n\n09:02.540 --> 09:03.720\n That's kind of fascinating.\n\n09:03.720 --> 09:06.820\n There's this duality between the mind and the body.\n\n09:06.820 --> 09:08.500\n It's like, it's the...\n\n09:09.740 --> 09:11.440\n Okay, sorry if I bring them up way too much,\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:13.060\n but David Goggins is like,\n\n09:14.320 --> 09:17.060\n the kind of things you go on in the long run,\n\n09:17.060 --> 09:19.680\n like the hell you might go through in your mind.\n\n09:19.680 --> 09:20.940\n Your mind can take a lot,\n\n09:20.940 --> 09:22.880\n and you can go through a lot with the mind,\n\n09:22.880 --> 09:25.060\n and the body will just be its own thing.\n\n09:25.060 --> 09:26.340\n You can go through hell,\n\n09:26.340 --> 09:30.100\n but after a good night's sleep, be back to normal,\n\n09:30.100 --> 09:31.580\n and the body's always there.\n\n09:31.580 --> 09:32.860\n So bringing it back to Goggins,\n\n09:32.860 --> 09:33.940\n it's like you can do that\n\n09:33.940 --> 09:36.140\n without even destroying your knee or whatever,\n\n09:36.140 --> 09:37.980\n or coming close and riding that line.\n\n09:37.980 --> 09:38.820\n That's true.\n\n09:38.820 --> 09:40.340\n So the unfortunate thing about the running,\n\n09:40.340 --> 09:42.960\n which he uses running to test the mind,\n\n09:42.960 --> 09:47.140\n so the aspect of running that is negative,\n\n09:47.140 --> 09:48.200\n in order to test the mind,\n\n09:48.200 --> 09:51.380\n you really have to push the body,\n\n09:51.380 --> 09:53.140\n take the body through a journey.\n\n09:53.140 --> 09:55.780\n I wish there was another way of doing that\n\n09:55.780 --> 09:57.500\n in the physical exercise space.\n\n09:57.500 --> 09:59.820\n I think there are exercises\n\n09:59.820 --> 10:01.340\n that are easier on the body than others,\n\n10:01.340 --> 10:04.940\n but running sure is a hell of an effective way to do it.\n\n10:04.940 --> 10:07.020\n And one of the ways that where it differs\n\n10:07.020 --> 10:10.520\n is that you're unlike exercise,\n\n10:10.520 --> 10:13.380\n you're essentially, most exercise,\n\n10:13.380 --> 10:15.460\n to really get to those intense levels,\n\n10:15.460 --> 10:17.980\n you really need to be persistent about it.\n\n10:17.980 --> 10:19.700\n I mean, it'll be intense if you're really out of shape,\n\n10:19.700 --> 10:22.640\n just jogging for five minutes,\n\n10:22.640 --> 10:24.100\n but to really get to those intense levels,\n\n10:24.100 --> 10:25.860\n you need to have the dedication.\n\n10:25.860 --> 10:27.180\n And so some of the other ways\n\n10:27.180 --> 10:32.180\n of altering subjective effects or states of consciousness,\n\n10:33.300 --> 10:35.260\n take that type of dedication.\n\n10:35.260 --> 10:39.040\n Psychedelics though, I mean, someone takes the right dose.\n\n10:39.040 --> 10:41.500\n They're strapped into the rollercoaster\n\n10:41.500 --> 10:44.420\n and something interesting is gonna happen.\n\n10:44.420 --> 10:48.220\n And I really like what you said about that distinction\n\n10:48.220 --> 10:51.580\n between the mind or the contrast between the mind effects\n\n10:51.580 --> 10:55.500\n and the body effects,\n\n10:55.500 --> 10:58.620\n because I think of this,\n\n10:58.620 --> 11:01.460\n I do research with all the drugs,\n\n11:01.460 --> 11:04.380\n caffeine, alcohol, methamphetamine, cocaine,\n\n11:04.380 --> 11:06.740\n alcohol, legal, illegal.\n\n11:06.740 --> 11:11.740\n Most of these drugs, thinking about say cocaine\n\n11:11.780 --> 11:15.740\n and methamphetamine, you can't give to a regular user,\n\n11:15.740 --> 11:20.740\n you can't safely give a dose where the regular cocaine user\n\n11:21.060 --> 11:24.100\n is gonna say, oh man, that's like,\n\n11:25.060 --> 11:28.340\n that's the strongest coke I've ever had, you know,\n\n11:28.340 --> 11:30.740\n because you get it past the ethics committee\n\n11:30.740 --> 11:32.260\n and you need approval.\n\n11:32.260 --> 11:34.300\n And I wouldn't wanna give someone something that's dangerous.\n\n11:34.300 --> 11:37.180\n So to go to those levels where they would say that,\n\n11:37.180 --> 11:38.180\n you would have to give something\n\n11:38.180 --> 11:43.180\n that's physiologically riskier, you know.\n\n11:43.340 --> 11:46.900\n Psilocybin or LSD, you can give a dose\n\n11:46.900 --> 11:50.660\n at the physiological level that is like very good chance\n\n11:50.660 --> 11:53.540\n it's gonna be the most intense psychological experience\n\n11:53.540 --> 11:56.260\n of that person's life and have zero chance\n\n11:56.260 --> 11:58.900\n for most people if you screen them of killing them.\n\n11:58.900 --> 12:01.320\n The big risk is behavioral toxicity,\n\n12:01.320 --> 12:03.820\n which is a fancy way of saying doing something stupid.\n\n12:03.820 --> 12:05.180\n I mean, you're really intoxicated,\n\n12:05.180 --> 12:08.100\n like if you wander into traffic or you fall from a height,\n\n12:08.100 --> 12:11.420\n just like plenty of people do on high doses of alcohol.\n\n12:11.420 --> 12:13.020\n And the other kind of unique thing\n\n12:13.020 --> 12:17.540\n about classic psychedelics is that they're not addictive,\n\n12:17.540 --> 12:20.740\n which is pretty much unheard of when it comes\n\n12:20.740 --> 12:24.740\n to so called drugs of abuse or drugs that people,\n\n12:24.740 --> 12:29.500\n at least at some frequency choose to take, you know,\n\n12:29.500 --> 12:32.860\n most of what we think of as drugs, you know,\n\n12:32.860 --> 12:35.640\n even caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis,\n\n12:36.500 --> 12:39.000\n most of these you can get into alcohol,\n\n12:39.000 --> 12:41.960\n you can get into a daily use pattern.\n\n12:41.960 --> 12:46.700\n And that's just extreme, so unheard of with psychedelics.\n\n12:46.700 --> 12:49.880\n Most people have taken these things on a daily basis,\n\n12:49.880 --> 12:53.380\n it's more of like they're building up the courage to do it\n\n12:53.380 --> 12:55.040\n and then they build up a tolerance or yeah,\n\n12:55.040 --> 12:56.540\n they're in college and they do it on a dare,\n\n12:56.540 --> 12:59.100\n can you take take acid seven days in a row\n\n12:59.100 --> 13:02.340\n and that type of thing rather than a self control issue\n\n13:02.340 --> 13:04.460\n where you have and say, oh God, I gotta stop taking this,\n\n13:04.460 --> 13:06.100\n I gotta stop drinking every night,\n\n13:06.100 --> 13:08.860\n I gotta cut down on the coke, whatever.\n\n13:08.860 --> 13:11.340\n So that's the classic psychedelics.\n\n13:11.340 --> 13:15.340\n What are the, what's a good term, modern psychedelics\n\n13:15.340 --> 13:18.480\n or more maybe psychedelics that are created in the lab?\n\n13:18.480 --> 13:19.680\n What else is there?\n\n13:19.680 --> 13:21.260\n Right, so MDMA is the big one.\n\n13:21.260 --> 13:23.920\n And I should say that with the classic psychedelics,\n\n13:23.920 --> 13:26.820\n that LSD is sort of, you can call it a semi synthetic\n\n13:26.820 --> 13:30.860\n because there's natural from both ergot\n\n13:30.860 --> 13:34.920\n and in certain seeds, morning glory seeds as one example,\n\n13:34.920 --> 13:36.180\n there's a very close,\n\n13:36.180 --> 13:40.780\n there are some very close chemical relatives of LSD.\n\n13:40.780 --> 13:44.900\n So LSD is close to what occurs in nature, but not quite.\n\n13:44.900 --> 13:49.540\n But then when we get into the other non classic psychedelics,\n\n13:49.540 --> 13:51.660\n probably the most prominent one is MDMA,\n\n13:51.660 --> 13:54.080\n people call it ecstasy, people call it Molly.\n\n13:55.380 --> 13:59.580\n And it is, it differs from classic psychedelics\n\n13:59.580 --> 14:04.580\n in a number of ways, it can be addictive, but not so.\n\n14:04.580 --> 14:07.380\n It's like, you can have cocaine on this end\n\n14:07.380 --> 14:10.620\n of the continuum and classic psychedelics here.\n\n14:10.620 --> 14:11.700\n Continuum of addiction.\n\n14:11.700 --> 14:13.140\n Continuum of addiction, you know,\n\n14:13.140 --> 14:15.060\n so it's certainly no cocaine.\n\n14:15.060 --> 14:17.860\n It's pretty rare for people to get into daily use patterns,\n\n14:17.860 --> 14:20.940\n but it's possible and they can get into more like,\n\n14:20.940 --> 14:23.140\n you know, using once a week pattern\n\n14:23.140 --> 14:25.180\n where they can find it hard to stop,\n\n14:25.180 --> 14:28.700\n but it's somewhere in between mostly towards the,\n\n14:28.700 --> 14:31.820\n to the classic psychedelic side in terms of\n\n14:33.580 --> 14:35.860\n like relatively little addiction potential.\n\n14:36.740 --> 14:39.540\n But it's also more physiologically dangerous.\n\n14:39.540 --> 14:43.260\n I think that the, certainly the therapeutic use,\n\n14:44.220 --> 14:47.220\n it's showing really promising effects for treating PTSD\n\n14:47.220 --> 14:48.220\n and the models that are used,\n\n14:48.220 --> 14:50.860\n I think those are extremely acceptable\n\n14:50.860 --> 14:52.660\n when it comes to the risk benefit ratio\n\n14:52.660 --> 14:54.960\n that you see all throughout medicine.\n\n14:54.960 --> 14:58.560\n But nonetheless, we do know that at a certain dose\n\n14:58.560 --> 15:02.840\n and a certain frequency that MDMA can cause longterm damage\n\n15:02.840 --> 15:05.880\n to the serotonin system in the brain.\n\n15:05.880 --> 15:10.000\n So it doesn't have that level of kind of freakish\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:13.160\n bodily safety that the classic psychedelics do.\n\n15:13.160 --> 15:16.000\n And it has more of a heart load, a cardiovascular,\n\n15:16.000 --> 15:18.560\n I don't mean kind of emotion, I mean, in this sense,\n\n15:18.560 --> 15:19.800\n although it is very emotional\n\n15:19.800 --> 15:23.120\n and that's something unique about its subjective effects,\n\n15:23.120 --> 15:25.760\n subjective effects, but it's more of a oppressor.\n\n15:25.760 --> 15:28.320\n And the terminology you use instead of\n\n15:28.320 --> 15:30.200\n like a freakish capacities,\n\n15:30.200 --> 15:32.280\n allowing you from a researcher perspective,\n\n15:32.280 --> 15:33.640\n but a personal perspective too,\n\n15:33.640 --> 15:37.360\n of taking a journey with some of these psychedelics\n\n15:37.360 --> 15:40.880\n that is the heroic dose, as they say.\n\n15:40.880 --> 15:43.000\n So like these are tools that allow you\n\n15:43.000 --> 15:45.640\n to take a serious mental journey, whatever that is.\n\n15:45.640 --> 15:46.480\n That's what you mean.\n\n15:46.480 --> 15:49.040\n And with MDMA, there's a little bit,\n\n15:49.040 --> 15:51.040\n it starts entering this territory\n\n15:51.040 --> 15:53.760\n where you gotta be careful about the risks\n\n15:53.760 --> 15:55.040\n to the body potentially.\n\n15:55.040 --> 15:58.400\n So yes, that in the sense that you can't kind of\n\n15:58.400 --> 16:02.760\n push the dose up as high as you safely as one can,\n\n16:02.760 --> 16:05.000\n if they're in the right setting, like in our research\n\n16:05.000 --> 16:07.280\n as they can with the classic psychedelics.\n\n16:07.280 --> 16:09.360\n But probably more importantly,\n\n16:09.360 --> 16:11.200\n just the nature of the effects with MDMA\n\n16:11.200 --> 16:14.480\n aren't the full on psychedelic.\n\n16:14.480 --> 16:16.560\n It's not the full journey.\n\n16:16.560 --> 16:21.280\n So it's sort of a psychedelic with rose colored glasses on.\n\n16:21.280 --> 16:22.880\n A psychedelic that's more of,\n\n16:22.880 --> 16:25.400\n it's been called more of a heart trip than a head trip.\n\n16:25.400 --> 16:28.760\n The nature of reality doesn't unravel\n\n16:28.760 --> 16:32.360\n as frequently as it does with classic psychedelics.\n\n16:32.360 --> 16:35.280\n But you're able to more directly sense your environment.\n\n16:35.280 --> 16:37.040\n So your perception system still works.\n\n16:37.040 --> 16:40.320\n It's not completely detached from reality with MDMA.\n\n16:40.320 --> 16:41.880\n That's true, relatively speaking.\n\n16:41.880 --> 16:45.760\n That said at most doses of classic psychedelics,\n\n16:45.760 --> 16:48.600\n you still have a tether to reality.\n\n16:48.600 --> 16:50.920\n Changes a little bit when you're talking about smoking DMT\n\n16:50.920 --> 16:53.080\n or smoking 5 methoxy DMT,\n\n16:54.160 --> 16:56.240\n which are some interesting examples\n\n16:56.240 --> 16:57.480\n we could talk more about.\n\n16:57.480 --> 17:02.480\n But with MDMA, for example,\n\n17:02.840 --> 17:07.840\n it's very rare to have what's called an ego loss experience\n\n17:07.960 --> 17:10.760\n or a sense of transcendental unity,\n\n17:10.760 --> 17:15.360\n where one really seemingly loses\n\n17:15.360 --> 17:19.000\n the psychological construct of the self.\n\n17:19.000 --> 17:24.000\n But MDMA, it's very common for people to have this,\n\n17:24.160 --> 17:26.760\n they still are perceiving themselves as a self,\n\n17:26.760 --> 17:30.240\n but it's common for them to have this warmth,\n\n17:30.240 --> 17:32.280\n this empathy for humanity\n\n17:32.280 --> 17:34.120\n and for their friends and loved ones.\n\n17:34.120 --> 17:36.440\n So it's more, and you see those effects\n\n17:36.440 --> 17:38.680\n under the classic psychedelics,\n\n17:38.680 --> 17:41.480\n but that's a subset of what the classic psychedelics do.\n\n17:41.480 --> 17:44.400\n So I see MDMA in terms of its subjective effects\n\n17:44.400 --> 17:47.560\n is if you think about Venn diagrams,\n\n17:47.560 --> 17:50.520\n it's sort of MDMA is all within the classic psychedelics.\n\n17:50.520 --> 17:54.240\n So everything that you see on a particular MDMA session,\n\n17:54.240 --> 17:58.160\n sometimes a psilocybin session looks just like that,\n\n17:58.160 --> 18:00.560\n but then sometimes it's completely different with psilocybin.\n\n18:00.560 --> 18:02.760\n It's a little more narrowed\n\n18:02.760 --> 18:05.200\n in terms of the variability with MDMA.\n\n18:05.200 --> 18:09.680\n Is there something general to say about what the psychedelics\n\n18:09.680 --> 18:11.560\n do to the human mind?\n\n18:11.560 --> 18:14.520\n You mentioned kind of an ego loss experience\n\n18:14.520 --> 18:16.600\n in the space of Venn diagrams.\n\n18:16.600 --> 18:20.040\n If we're to like draw a big circle,\n\n18:20.040 --> 18:22.120\n what can we say about that big circle?\n\n18:23.640 --> 18:28.520\n In terms of people's report of subjective experience,\n\n18:28.520 --> 18:31.720\n probably one of the most general things we can say\n\n18:31.720 --> 18:35.160\n is that it expands that range.\n\n18:35.160 --> 18:38.280\n So many people come out of these sessions\n\n18:38.280 --> 18:41.800\n saying that they didn't know it was possible\n\n18:41.800 --> 18:44.080\n to have an experience like that.\n\n18:44.080 --> 18:47.120\n So there's an emphasis on the subjective experience\n\n18:47.120 --> 18:52.120\n that is there words that people put to it\n\n18:52.960 --> 18:55.080\n that capture that experience\n\n18:55.080 --> 19:00.040\n or is it something that just has to be experienced?\n\n19:00.040 --> 19:02.000\n Yeah, people like...\n\n19:02.000 --> 19:03.680\n As a researcher, that's an interesting question\n\n19:03.680 --> 19:08.680\n because you have to kind of measure the effects of this\n\n19:10.280 --> 19:13.160\n and how do you convert that into numbers?\n\n19:13.160 --> 19:14.000\n Right.\n\n19:14.000 --> 19:15.560\n That's the ultimate challenge.\n\n19:15.560 --> 19:19.760\n So is that possible to one, convert it into words\n\n19:19.760 --> 19:22.280\n and the second, convert the words into numbers somehow?\n\n19:22.280 --> 19:25.080\n So we do a lot of that with questionnaires,\n\n19:25.080 --> 19:28.040\n some of which are very psychometrically validated.\n\n19:28.040 --> 19:30.880\n So lots of numbers have been crunched on them.\n\n19:30.880 --> 19:33.520\n And there's always a limitation with questionnaires.\n\n19:33.520 --> 19:35.560\n I mean, subjective effects are subjective effects.\n\n19:35.560 --> 19:38.800\n Ultimately, it's what the person is reporting\n\n19:38.800 --> 19:43.360\n and that doesn't necessarily point towards a ground truth.\n\n19:45.520 --> 19:46.800\n So for example, if someone says\n\n19:46.800 --> 19:48.880\n that they felt like they touched another dimension\n\n19:48.880 --> 19:52.440\n or they felt like they sensed the reality of God\n\n19:52.440 --> 19:57.200\n or if they, I mean, just you name it,\n\n19:57.200 --> 20:01.160\n people's ontological views can sometimes shift.\n\n20:01.160 --> 20:03.080\n I think that's more about where they're coming from\n\n20:03.080 --> 20:05.120\n and I don't think it's the quintessential way\n\n20:05.120 --> 20:05.960\n in which they work.\n\n20:05.960 --> 20:06.800\n There's plenty of people that hold\n\n20:06.800 --> 20:09.600\n onto a completely naturalistic viewpoint\n\n20:09.600 --> 20:14.600\n and have profound and helpful experiences\n\n20:15.080 --> 20:16.760\n with these compounds.\n\n20:16.760 --> 20:20.680\n But the subjective effects can be so broad\n\n20:20.680 --> 20:24.600\n that for some people, it shifts their philosophical\n\n20:24.600 --> 20:27.280\n viewpoint more towards idealism,\n\n20:27.280 --> 20:32.280\n more towards thinking that the nature of reality\n\n20:32.280 --> 20:37.280\n might be more about consciousness than about material.\n\n20:38.160 --> 20:40.280\n That's a domain I'm very interested in.\n\n20:40.280 --> 20:43.680\n Right now, we have essentially zero to say about that\n\n20:43.680 --> 20:46.140\n in terms of validating those types of claims,\n\n20:46.140 --> 20:47.400\n but it's even interesting just to see\n\n20:47.400 --> 20:49.280\n what people say along those lines.\n\n20:49.280 --> 20:50.840\n So you're interested in saying like,\n\n20:50.840 --> 20:54.600\n can we more rigorously study this process of expansion?\n\n20:54.600 --> 20:57.000\n Like, what do we mean by this expansion\n\n20:57.000 --> 21:00.760\n of your sense of what is possible\n\n21:00.760 --> 21:02.880\n in the experiences in this world?\n\n21:02.880 --> 21:05.400\n Right, as much as what we can say about that\n\n21:05.400 --> 21:07.760\n through naturalistic psychology,\n\n21:07.760 --> 21:09.520\n especially as much as we can root it\n\n21:09.520 --> 21:13.520\n to solid psychological constructs\n\n21:13.520 --> 21:16.200\n and solid neuroscientific constructs.\n\n21:16.200 --> 21:18.920\n And I wonder what the impact is of the language\n\n21:18.920 --> 21:20.520\n that you bring to the table.\n\n21:20.520 --> 21:25.080\n So you mentioned about God or speaking of God,\n\n21:25.080 --> 21:26.560\n a lot of people are really into sort of\n\n21:26.560 --> 21:29.440\n theoretical physics these days at a very surface level\n\n21:29.440 --> 21:31.920\n and you can bring the language of physics, right?\n\n21:31.920 --> 21:33.920\n You can talk about quantum mechanics,\n\n21:33.920 --> 21:36.560\n you can talk about general relativity\n\n21:36.560 --> 21:40.520\n and curvature of space time and using just that language\n\n21:40.520 --> 21:43.280\n without a deep technical understanding of it\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:45.680\n to somehow start thinking like,\n\n21:45.680 --> 21:48.040\n sort of visualizing atoms in your head\n\n21:48.040 --> 21:50.560\n and somehow through that process\n\n21:50.560 --> 21:51.860\n because you have the language,\n\n21:51.860 --> 21:55.280\n using that language to kind of dissolve the ego,\n\n21:55.280 --> 21:58.880\n like realize like that we're just all little bits\n\n21:58.880 --> 22:02.800\n of physical objects that behave in mysterious ways.\n\n22:02.800 --> 22:04.800\n And so that has to do with the language.\n\n22:04.800 --> 22:08.000\n Like if you read a Sean Carroll book or something recently,\n\n22:08.000 --> 22:09.820\n it seems like it has a huge influence\n\n22:09.820 --> 22:13.720\n on the way you might experience,\n\n22:13.720 --> 22:16.120\n might perceive the world and might experience\n\n22:16.120 --> 22:19.520\n the alteration that psychedelics brings\n\n22:19.520 --> 22:23.280\n to your perception system.\n\n22:23.280 --> 22:26.000\n So I wonder like the language you bring to the table,\n\n22:26.000 --> 22:30.480\n how that affects the journey you go on with the psychedelics.\n\n22:30.480 --> 22:32.760\n I think very much so.\n\n22:32.760 --> 22:34.920\n And I think there's, I'm a little concerned\n\n22:34.920 --> 22:36.760\n some of the science is going a little too far\n\n22:36.760 --> 22:40.520\n in the direction of around the edges,\n\n22:40.520 --> 22:44.880\n speaking about it changing beliefs in this sense\n\n22:44.880 --> 22:48.800\n or that sense about particular, in particular domains.\n\n22:48.800 --> 22:51.680\n And I think what really what a lot of what's going on\n\n22:51.680 --> 22:53.720\n is what you just discussed.\n\n22:53.720 --> 22:56.840\n It's the priors coming into it.\n\n22:56.840 --> 23:00.980\n So if you've been reading a lot of physics,\n\n23:00.980 --> 23:05.880\n then you might bring up like space time\n\n23:05.880 --> 23:08.120\n and interpret the experience in that sense.\n\n23:08.120 --> 23:10.000\n I mean, it's not uncommon for people come out\n\n23:10.000 --> 23:11.400\n talking about visions of the,\n\n23:12.480 --> 23:13.520\n it's not the most typical thing,\n\n23:13.520 --> 23:16.120\n but it's come up in sessions I've guided,\n\n23:16.120 --> 23:21.120\n the Big Bang and this sort of nature of reality.\n\n23:21.120 --> 23:23.880\n I think probably that the best way to think\n\n23:23.880 --> 23:26.440\n about these experiences is that,\n\n23:26.440 --> 23:27.480\n and the best evidence,\n\n23:27.480 --> 23:30.460\n even though we're in our infancy and understanding it,\n\n23:30.460 --> 23:34.720\n they really tap into more general psychological mechanisms.\n\n23:34.720 --> 23:36.200\n I think one of the best arguments\n\n23:36.200 --> 23:41.200\n is they reduce the influence of our priors,\n\n23:41.360 --> 23:45.360\n of what we bring into all of the assumptions\n\n23:45.360 --> 23:47.320\n that we all that we're essentially,\n\n23:47.320 --> 23:49.520\n especially as adults, we're riding on top of heuristic\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:51.880\n after heuristic to get through life.\n\n23:51.880 --> 23:53.280\n And you need to do that.\n\n23:53.280 --> 23:54.360\n And that's a good thing.\n\n23:54.360 --> 23:55.800\n And that's extremely efficient\n\n23:55.800 --> 23:57.680\n and evolution has shaped that,\n\n23:57.680 --> 23:59.760\n but that comes at an expense.\n\n23:59.760 --> 24:04.760\n And it seems that these experiences\n\n24:04.860 --> 24:09.860\n will allow someone greater mental flexibility and openness.\n\n24:12.040 --> 24:16.960\n And so one can be both less influenced\n\n24:16.960 --> 24:18.940\n by their prior assumptions,\n\n24:18.940 --> 24:22.160\n but still nonetheless the nature of the experience\n\n24:22.160 --> 24:24.760\n can be influenced by what they've been exposed to\n\n24:24.760 --> 24:25.600\n in the world.\n\n24:25.600 --> 24:28.440\n And sometimes they can get it in a deeper way.\n\n24:28.440 --> 24:29.280\n Like maybe they've read,\n\n24:29.280 --> 24:31.520\n I mean, I had a philosophy professor one time\n\n24:31.520 --> 24:34.960\n as a participant in a high dose psilocybin study.\n\n24:34.960 --> 24:37.720\n And I remember him saying, my God,\n\n24:37.720 --> 24:40.440\n it's like Hegel's opposites defining each other.\n\n24:40.440 --> 24:41.580\n Like, I get it.\n\n24:41.580 --> 24:44.600\n I've taught this thing for years and years and years.\n\n24:44.600 --> 24:46.380\n Like, I get it now.\n\n24:46.380 --> 24:49.120\n And so like that, you know,\n\n24:49.120 --> 24:51.480\n and even at the psychological, emotional level,\n\n24:51.480 --> 24:54.680\n like the cancer patients we worked with,\n\n24:54.680 --> 24:56.280\n you know, they told themselves a million times\n\n24:56.280 --> 24:57.680\n over this people trying to quit smoking,\n\n24:57.680 --> 24:58.680\n I need to quit smoking.\n\n24:58.680 --> 25:00.760\n Oh, I'm ruining my life with this cancer.\n\n25:00.760 --> 25:01.600\n I'm still healthy.\n\n25:01.600 --> 25:02.420\n I should be getting out.\n\n25:02.420 --> 25:03.680\n I'm letting this thing defeat me.\n\n25:03.680 --> 25:05.240\n It's like, yeah, you told yourself that in your head,\n\n25:05.240 --> 25:07.800\n but sometimes they had these experiences\n\n25:07.800 --> 25:10.160\n and they kind of feel it in their heart.\n\n25:10.160 --> 25:11.920\n Like they really get it.\n\n25:11.920 --> 25:16.920\n So in some sense that you bring some prize to the table,\n\n25:17.620 --> 25:22.040\n but psychedelics allow you to acknowledge them\n\n25:22.040 --> 25:23.320\n and then throw them away.\n\n25:23.320 --> 25:26.680\n So like one popular terminology around this\n\n25:26.680 --> 25:29.760\n in the engineering space is first principles thinking\n\n25:29.760 --> 25:33.820\n that Elon Musk, for example, espouses a lot.\n\n25:33.820 --> 25:35.060\n Let me ask a fun question\n\n25:35.060 --> 25:38.380\n before we return to a more serious discussion.\n\n25:38.380 --> 25:42.140\n With Elon Musk as an example,\n\n25:42.140 --> 25:45.100\n but it could be just engineers in general,\n\n25:45.100 --> 25:48.520\n do you think there's a use for psychedelics\n\n25:48.520 --> 25:53.520\n to take a journey of rigorous first principles thinking?\n\n25:54.100 --> 25:55.620\n So like throwing away,\n\n25:55.620 --> 25:58.380\n we're not talking about throwing away assumptions\n\n25:58.380 --> 26:02.080\n about the nature of reality in terms of like our philosophy\n\n26:02.080 --> 26:04.020\n of the way we live day to day life,\n\n26:04.020 --> 26:08.220\n but we're talking about like how to build a better rocket\n\n26:08.220 --> 26:09.980\n or how to build a better car\n\n26:09.980 --> 26:12.380\n or how to build a better social network\n\n26:12.380 --> 26:15.060\n or all those kinds of things, engineering questions.\n\n26:15.060 --> 26:17.740\n I absolutely think there's huge potential there.\n\n26:17.740 --> 26:22.740\n And there was some research in the late 60s, early 70s\n\n26:22.860 --> 26:26.060\n that were, it was very early and not very rigorous\n\n26:26.060 --> 26:31.060\n in terms of methodology, but it was consistent with the,\n\n26:31.380 --> 26:34.020\n I mean, there's just countless anecdotes of folks.\n\n26:34.020 --> 26:36.380\n I mean, people have argued that just,\n\n26:36.380 --> 26:39.460\n Silicon Valley was largely influenced\n\n26:39.460 --> 26:41.500\n by psychedelic experience.\n\n26:41.500 --> 26:43.780\n I remember the, I think the person that came up\n\n26:43.780 --> 26:46.260\n with the concept of freeware or shareware,\n\n26:46.260 --> 26:50.460\n it's like it kind of was generated out of\n\n26:50.460 --> 26:53.720\n or influenced by psychedelic experience.\n\n26:53.720 --> 26:56.340\n So to this, I think there's incredible potential there\n\n26:56.340 --> 26:59.380\n and we know really next,\n\n26:59.380 --> 27:03.180\n there's no rigorous research on that, but.\n\n27:03.180 --> 27:05.700\n Is there anecdotal stuff like with Steve Jobs?\n\n27:05.700 --> 27:07.500\n I think there's stories, right?\n\n27:07.500 --> 27:09.020\n In your exploration of that,\n\n27:09.020 --> 27:12.700\n is there something a little bit more than just stories?\n\n27:12.700 --> 27:16.420\n Is there like a little bit more of a solid data points,\n\n27:16.420 --> 27:20.820\n even if they're just experiential like anecdotes?\n\n27:20.820 --> 27:22.960\n Is there something that you draw inspiration from\n\n27:22.960 --> 27:24.340\n like in your intuition?\n\n27:24.340 --> 27:25.580\n Because we'll talk about,\n\n27:25.580 --> 27:27.220\n you're trying to construct studies\n\n27:27.220 --> 27:29.420\n that are more rigorous around these questions.\n\n27:29.420 --> 27:31.660\n But is there something you draw inspiration from,\n\n27:31.660 --> 27:34.220\n from the past, from the 80s and the 90s\n\n27:34.220 --> 27:37.200\n and Silicon Valley, that kind of space?\n\n27:37.200 --> 27:40.400\n Or is it just like you have a sense\n\n27:40.400 --> 27:42.560\n based on everything you've learned\n\n27:42.560 --> 27:44.620\n and these kind of loose stories\n\n27:44.620 --> 27:47.460\n that there's something worth digging at?\n\n27:47.460 --> 27:50.140\n I am influenced by the, gosh,\n\n27:50.140 --> 27:55.140\n the just incredible number of anecdotes surrounding these.\n\n27:55.420 --> 27:56.260\n I mean,\n\n27:58.820 --> 28:02.140\n Carey Mullis, he invented PCR.\n\n28:02.140 --> 28:05.900\n I mean, absolutely revolutionized biological sciences.\n\n28:05.900 --> 28:08.380\n He says he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize for him.\n\n28:08.380 --> 28:09.780\n He said he wouldn't have come up with that\n\n28:09.780 --> 28:12.040\n had he not had psychedelic experiences.\n\n28:14.300 --> 28:15.500\n Now, he's an interesting character.\n\n28:15.500 --> 28:17.100\n People should read his autobiography\n\n28:17.100 --> 28:19.940\n because you could point to other things he was into.\n\n28:19.940 --> 28:22.660\n But I think that speaks to the casting your nets wide\n\n28:22.660 --> 28:23.740\n and this mental flex,\n\n28:23.740 --> 28:27.320\n more of these general mechanisms\n\n28:27.320 --> 28:29.700\n where sometimes if you cast your nets really wide\n\n28:29.700 --> 28:31.260\n and it's gonna depend on the person\n\n28:31.260 --> 28:32.220\n and their influences,\n\n28:32.220 --> 28:35.220\n but sometimes you come up with false positives.\n\n28:38.180 --> 28:39.040\n You connect the dots\n\n28:39.040 --> 28:41.220\n where maybe you shouldn't have connected those dots,\n\n28:41.220 --> 28:44.700\n but I think that can be constrained.\n\n28:44.700 --> 28:47.200\n And so much of our,\n\n28:47.200 --> 28:49.180\n not only our personal psychological suffering,\n\n28:49.180 --> 28:53.160\n but our limitations academically\n\n28:53.160 --> 28:55.620\n and in terms of technology\n\n28:55.620 --> 28:59.500\n are because of the self imposed limitations\n\n28:59.500 --> 29:03.620\n and heuristics, these entrenched ways of thinking.\n\n29:03.620 --> 29:06.460\n Like those examples throughout the history of science\n\n29:06.460 --> 29:09.580\n where someone has come up with the paradigm,\n\n29:09.580 --> 29:11.600\n Kuhn's paradigm shifts.\n\n29:11.600 --> 29:14.540\n It's like, here's something completely different.\n\n29:14.540 --> 29:17.140\n This doesn't make sense by any of the previous models.\n\n29:17.140 --> 29:20.500\n And like, we need more of those.\n\n29:20.500 --> 29:22.620\n And then you need the right balance between that\n\n29:22.620 --> 29:27.220\n because so many of the novel crazy ideas are just bunk\n\n29:27.220 --> 29:31.040\n and that's what science is about separating them\n\n29:31.040 --> 29:33.860\n from the valid paradigm shifting ideas.\n\n29:33.860 --> 29:38.860\n But we need more paradigm shifting ideas like in a big way.\n\n29:38.960 --> 29:40.260\n And I think we could,\n\n29:40.260 --> 29:42.060\n I think you could argue that we've,\n\n29:42.060 --> 29:45.100\n because of the structure of academia and science\n\n29:45.100 --> 29:49.060\n in modern times, it heavily biases against those.\n\n29:49.060 --> 29:52.620\n Right, there's all kinds of mechanisms in our human nature\n\n29:52.620 --> 29:56.940\n that resist paradigm shift quite sort of obviously.\n\n29:56.940 --> 30:01.040\n So, and psychedelics, there could be a lot of other tools\n\n30:01.040 --> 30:04.740\n but it seems like psychedelics could be one set of tools\n\n30:04.740 --> 30:08.980\n that encourage paradigm shifting thinking.\n\n30:08.980 --> 30:11.380\n So like the first principles kind of thinking.\n\n30:11.380 --> 30:16.100\n So it's a kind of, you're at the forefront of research here.\n\n30:16.100 --> 30:18.780\n There's just kind of anecdotal stories.\n\n30:18.780 --> 30:21.300\n There's early studies.\n\n30:21.300 --> 30:24.500\n There's a sense that we don't understand very much\n\n30:24.500 --> 30:26.740\n but there's a lot of depth here.\n\n30:26.740 --> 30:31.460\n How do we get from there to where Elon and I can regularly,\n\n30:31.460 --> 30:35.020\n like I wake up every morning, I have deep work sessions\n\n30:35.020 --> 30:40.020\n where it's well understood like what dose to take.\n\n30:41.740 --> 30:45.980\n Like if I want to explore something where it's all legal,\n\n30:45.980 --> 30:49.020\n where it's all understood and safe, all that kind of stuff.\n\n30:49.020 --> 30:53.540\n How do we get from where we are today to there?\n\n30:53.540 --> 30:57.260\n Not speaking in terms of legality in the sense like\n\n30:57.260 --> 30:59.880\n policy making all that like laws and stuff,\n\n30:59.880 --> 31:02.940\n meaning like how do we scientifically understand this stuff\n\n31:02.940 --> 31:07.580\n well enough to get to a place where I can just take it safely\n\n31:07.580 --> 31:10.780\n in order to expand my thinking,\n\n31:10.780 --> 31:12.540\n like this kind of first principles thinking,\n\n31:12.540 --> 31:14.780\n which I'm in my personal life currently doing.\n\n31:14.780 --> 31:18.420\n Like how do I revolutionize particular several things?\n\n31:18.420 --> 31:22.300\n Like it seems like the only tools I have right now\n\n31:22.300 --> 31:27.300\n is just, just, but my mind going, doing the first principles\n\n31:28.260 --> 31:30.020\n like, wait, wait, wait, okay.\n\n31:30.020 --> 31:31.740\n Why has this been done this way?\n\n31:31.740 --> 31:33.780\n Can we do it completely differently?\n\n31:33.780 --> 31:37.500\n It seems like I'm still tethered to the priors\n\n31:37.500 --> 31:39.060\n that I bring to the table\n\n31:39.060 --> 31:40.860\n and I keep trying to untether myself.\n\n31:40.860 --> 31:43.140\n Maybe there's tools that can systematically\n\n31:43.140 --> 31:44.580\n help me untether.\n\n31:44.580 --> 31:49.340\n Yeah, well, we need experiments and that's tied to\n\n31:49.340 --> 31:51.980\n kind of the policy level stuff.\n\n31:51.980 --> 31:52.820\n And I should be clear,\n\n31:52.820 --> 31:57.140\n I would never encourage anyone to do anything illicitly.\n\n31:57.140 --> 32:02.140\n But yeah, in the future, we could see these compounds\n\n32:03.460 --> 32:08.420\n used for technical and scientific innovation.\n\n32:08.420 --> 32:11.700\n What we need are studies that are digging into that.\n\n32:11.700 --> 32:13.780\n Right now, most of what the funding,\n\n32:13.780 --> 32:18.740\n which is largely from philanthropy, not from the government,\n\n32:18.740 --> 32:23.300\n largely what it's for is treatment of mental disorders\n\n32:23.300 --> 32:27.060\n like addiction and depression, et cetera.\n\n32:27.060 --> 32:28.740\n But we need studies.\n\n32:28.740 --> 32:33.740\n One of the early initial stabs on this question decades ago\n\n32:34.740 --> 32:37.780\n was they took some architects and engineers\n\n32:37.780 --> 32:40.860\n and said, what problems have you been working on?\n\n32:40.860 --> 32:42.460\n Where have you been stuck for months\n\n32:42.460 --> 32:43.740\n like working on this damn thing\n\n32:43.740 --> 32:45.060\n and you're not getting anywhere,\n\n32:45.060 --> 32:47.420\n like your head's butting up against the wall.\n\n32:47.420 --> 32:49.180\n It's like, come in here, take,\n\n32:49.180 --> 32:51.140\n and I think it was 100 micrograms of LSD.\n\n32:51.140 --> 32:52.740\n So not a big session.\n\n32:52.740 --> 32:54.260\n And a little bit different model\n\n32:54.260 --> 32:55.260\n where they were actually working.\n\n32:55.260 --> 32:56.340\n It was a moderate enough dose\n\n32:56.340 --> 32:59.940\n where they could work on the problem during the session.\n\n33:00.860 --> 33:04.460\n I think probably, I'm an empiricist,\n\n33:04.460 --> 33:06.340\n so I'd like to see all the studies done.\n\n33:06.340 --> 33:08.180\n But the first thing I would do is like\n\n33:08.180 --> 33:10.580\n a really high dose session where you're not necessarily\n\n33:10.580 --> 33:13.140\n in front of your computer,\n\n33:13.140 --> 33:16.060\n which you can't really do on a really high dose.\n\n33:16.060 --> 33:19.180\n And then the work has been talked about,\n\n33:19.180 --> 33:21.780\n like you take a really high dose, you take a journey,\n\n33:21.780 --> 33:23.740\n and then the breakthroughs come\n\n33:23.740 --> 33:25.940\n from when you return from the journey\n\n33:25.940 --> 33:29.100\n and like integrate, quote unquote, that experience.\n\n33:29.100 --> 33:30.700\n I think that's where all the,\n\n33:30.700 --> 33:33.700\n again, we're babies at this point,\n\n33:33.700 --> 33:37.660\n but my gut tells me that it's the so called integration,\n\n33:37.660 --> 33:38.500\n the aftermath.\n\n33:38.500 --> 33:41.060\n We know that there's some different forms of neuroplasticity\n\n33:41.060 --> 33:43.340\n that are unfolding in the days following a psychedelics,\n\n33:43.340 --> 33:45.820\n at least in animals, probably going on humans.\n\n33:45.820 --> 33:48.340\n We don't know if that's related to the therapeutic effects.\n\n33:48.340 --> 33:50.660\n My gut tells me it is,\n\n33:50.660 --> 33:52.980\n although it's only part of the story,\n\n33:52.980 --> 33:55.700\n but we need big studies where we compare people,\n\n33:55.700 --> 33:57.660\n like let's get a hundred people like that,\n\n33:57.660 --> 34:00.420\n scientists that are working on a problem,\n\n34:00.420 --> 34:02.140\n and then randomize them too.\n\n34:02.140 --> 34:07.060\n And then I think you need even more credible,\n\n34:07.060 --> 34:10.140\n active controls or active placebo conditions\n\n34:10.140 --> 34:12.340\n to kind of tease this out.\n\n34:13.340 --> 34:14.900\n And then also in conjunction with that,\n\n34:14.900 --> 34:16.300\n and you can do this in the same study,\n\n34:16.300 --> 34:19.180\n you wanna combine that with more rigorous\n\n34:19.180 --> 34:22.900\n sort of experimental models\n\n34:22.900 --> 34:25.260\n where we actually give there a problem solving tasks\n\n34:25.260 --> 34:27.700\n that we know, for example, that you tend to do better on\n\n34:27.700 --> 34:30.020\n after you've gotten a good night's sleep versus not.\n\n34:30.020 --> 34:33.900\n And my sense is there's a relationship there.\n\n34:33.900 --> 34:36.780\n People go back to first principles,\n\n34:36.780 --> 34:39.220\n questioning those first principles they're operating under\n\n34:39.220 --> 34:43.140\n and getting away from their priors\n\n34:43.140 --> 34:45.380\n in terms of creative problem solving.\n\n34:45.380 --> 34:47.460\n And so I think wrap those things\n\n34:47.460 --> 34:50.180\n and you could speak a little more rigorously about those\n\n34:50.180 --> 34:52.780\n because ultimately, if everyone's bringing their own problem,\n\n34:52.780 --> 34:57.060\n that's more in the face valid side,\n\n34:57.060 --> 34:58.780\n but you can't dig in as much\n\n34:58.780 --> 35:01.300\n and get as much experimental power\n\n35:01.300 --> 35:03.660\n and speak to the mechanisms as you can\n\n35:03.660 --> 35:06.820\n with having everyone do the same sort of canned\n\n35:06.820 --> 35:08.820\n problem solving task.\n\n35:08.820 --> 35:10.980\n So we've been speaking about psychedelics generally.\n\n35:10.980 --> 35:14.060\n Is there one you find from the scientific perspective\n\n35:14.060 --> 35:16.300\n or maybe even philosophical perspective\n\n35:16.300 --> 35:18.580\n most fascinating to study?\n\n35:18.580 --> 35:22.340\n Therapeutically, I'm most interested in psilocybin and LSD\n\n35:22.340 --> 35:24.380\n and I think we need to do a lot more with LSD\n\n35:24.380 --> 35:27.060\n because it's mainly been psilocybin in the modern era.\n\n35:27.060 --> 35:28.540\n I've recently gotten a grant\n\n35:28.540 --> 35:32.260\n from the Heftar Research Institute to do an LSD study.\n\n35:32.260 --> 35:33.420\n So I haven't started it yet,\n\n35:33.420 --> 35:36.340\n but I'm going through the paperwork and everything.\n\n35:36.340 --> 35:38.980\n Therapeutic meaning there's some issue\n\n35:38.980 --> 35:40.380\n and you're trying to treat that issue.\n\n35:40.380 --> 35:41.740\n Right, right.\n\n35:41.740 --> 35:45.660\n In terms of just like, what's the most fascinating,\n\n35:45.660 --> 35:47.660\n understanding the nature of these experiences,\n\n35:47.660 --> 35:49.420\n if you really wanna like wrap your head around\n\n35:49.420 --> 35:53.380\n what's going on when someone has a completely altered sense\n\n35:53.380 --> 35:55.700\n of reality and sense of self,\n\n35:55.700 --> 36:00.700\n there I think you're talking about the high dose,\n\n36:00.980 --> 36:04.020\n either smoked vaporized or intravenous injection,\n\n36:04.020 --> 36:07.900\n which all kind of, they're very similar pharmacologically,\n\n36:07.900 --> 36:11.220\n of DMT and 5 methoxy DMT.\n\n36:11.220 --> 36:13.260\n This is like when people, this is what,\n\n36:13.260 --> 36:15.220\n I don't know if you're familiar with Terrence McKenna,\n\n36:15.220 --> 36:16.780\n he would talk a lot about smoking DMT,\n\n36:16.780 --> 36:19.780\n Joe Rogan has talked a lot about that.\n\n36:19.780 --> 36:20.620\n People will say that,\n\n36:20.620 --> 36:23.500\n and there's a close relative called 5 methoxy DMT.\n\n36:23.500 --> 36:25.580\n Most people who know the terrain will say\n\n36:25.580 --> 36:30.580\n that's an order of magnitude or orders of magnitude beyond,\n\n36:30.820 --> 36:33.820\n I mean, anything one could get from even a high dose\n\n36:33.820 --> 36:36.300\n of psilocybin or LSD.\n\n36:36.300 --> 36:39.540\n I think it's a question about whether, you know,\n\n36:39.540 --> 36:40.500\n how therapeutic,\n\n36:40.500 --> 36:42.420\n I think there is a therapeutic potential there,\n\n36:42.420 --> 36:45.300\n but it's probably not as sure of a bet\n\n36:45.300 --> 36:47.780\n because one goes so far out,\n\n36:47.780 --> 36:49.580\n it's almost like they're not contemplating\n\n36:49.580 --> 36:51.820\n their relationship and their direction in life.\n\n36:51.820 --> 36:55.660\n They are like reality is ripping apart at the seams\n\n36:55.660 --> 37:00.660\n and the very nature of the self and of the sense of reality.\n\n37:01.660 --> 37:04.940\n And the amazing thing about these compounds\n\n37:04.940 --> 37:09.500\n and same to a less degree with oral psilocybin and LSD\n\n37:09.500 --> 37:12.460\n is that unlike some other drugs\n\n37:12.460 --> 37:14.820\n that really throw you far out there,\n\n37:16.100 --> 37:18.820\n you know, anesthetics and even alcohol,\n\n37:18.820 --> 37:21.740\n like as reality starts to become different\n\n37:21.740 --> 37:24.820\n at higher and higher doses, there's this numbing,\n\n37:24.820 --> 37:25.900\n there's this sort of,\n\n37:26.980 --> 37:31.580\n there's this ability for the sense of being the center,\n\n37:31.580 --> 37:35.180\n having a conscious experience that's memorable,\n\n37:35.180 --> 37:37.380\n that is maintained\n\n37:37.380 --> 37:40.140\n throughout these classic psychedelic experiences.\n\n37:40.140 --> 37:44.700\n Like one can go as far, so far out while still\n\n37:47.700 --> 37:50.540\n being aware of the experience\n\n37:50.540 --> 37:52.180\n and remembering the experience.\n\n37:52.180 --> 37:55.460\n Interesting, so being able to carry something back.\n\n37:55.460 --> 37:56.700\n Right.\n\n37:56.700 --> 38:01.340\n Can you dig in a little deeper, like what is DMT,\n\n38:01.340 --> 38:03.980\n how long is the trip usually,\n\n38:03.980 --> 38:06.340\n like how much do we understand about it?\n\n38:06.340 --> 38:08.820\n Is there something interesting to say\n\n38:09.820 --> 38:12.940\n about just the nature of the experience\n\n38:12.940 --> 38:15.380\n and what we understand about it?\n\n38:15.380 --> 38:17.660\n One of the common methods for people to use it\n\n38:17.660 --> 38:19.820\n is to smoke it or vaporize it.\n\n38:19.820 --> 38:21.700\n And it usually takes,\n\n38:21.700 --> 38:23.420\n this is a pretty good kind of description\n\n38:23.420 --> 38:25.420\n of what it might feel like on the ground.\n\n38:26.580 --> 38:30.980\n The caveat is it's a completely insufficient description\n\n38:30.980 --> 38:33.100\n that someone's gonna be listening to.\n\n38:33.100 --> 38:36.100\n It's like nothing you could say is gonna come close.\n\n38:36.100 --> 38:40.540\n But it'll take about three big hits, inhalations,\n\n38:40.540 --> 38:43.300\n in order to have what people call a breakthrough dose.\n\n38:45.980 --> 38:48.060\n And there's no great definition of that,\n\n38:48.060 --> 38:52.580\n but basically meaning moving away from,\n\n38:52.580 --> 38:56.220\n not just having the typical psilocybin or LSD experience\n\n38:56.220 --> 38:58.300\n where like things are radically different,\n\n38:58.300 --> 39:02.460\n but you're still basically a person in this reality\n\n39:02.460 --> 39:03.860\n to go in somewhere else.\n\n39:04.780 --> 39:07.660\n And so that'll typically take like three hits.\n\n39:07.660 --> 39:10.580\n And this stuff comes on like a freight train.\n\n39:10.580 --> 39:11.980\n So one takes a hit\n\n39:11.980 --> 39:16.260\n and around the time of the first exhalation,\n\n39:16.260 --> 39:18.300\n so we're talking about a few seconds in,\n\n39:18.300 --> 39:22.380\n or maybe just sometime between the first and the second hit,\n\n39:22.380 --> 39:23.940\n like it'll start to come on.\n\n39:23.940 --> 39:27.700\n And they're already up to, let's say,\n\n39:27.700 --> 39:30.380\n what they might get from a 30 milligram\n\n39:30.380 --> 39:34.500\n or 300 microgram LSD trip, a big trip.\n\n39:34.500 --> 39:37.860\n They're already there at the second hit,\n\n39:37.860 --> 39:39.980\n but their consciousness is geared,\n\n39:39.980 --> 39:43.820\n this is like acceleration, not speed, to speak of physics.\n\n39:43.820 --> 39:47.100\n It's like those receptors are getting filled like that\n\n39:47.100 --> 39:50.820\n and they're going from zero to 60 in like Tesla time.\n\n39:50.820 --> 39:54.180\n And at the second hit, again,\n\n39:54.180 --> 39:57.300\n they're at maybe the strongest psychedelic experience\n\n39:57.300 --> 39:58.620\n they've ever had.\n\n39:58.620 --> 40:01.380\n And then if they can take that third hit,\n\n40:01.380 --> 40:02.580\n and some people can't,\n\n40:06.860 --> 40:10.820\n they're propelled into this other reality.\n\n40:10.820 --> 40:14.060\n And the nature of that other reality will differ\n\n40:14.060 --> 40:15.300\n depending on who you ask,\n\n40:15.300 --> 40:18.180\n but folks will often talk about it.\n\n40:18.180 --> 40:21.780\n And we've done some survey research on this.\n\n40:21.780 --> 40:26.780\n Entities of different types, elves tend to pop up.\n\n40:27.220 --> 40:29.780\n The caveat is that I strongly presume\n\n40:29.780 --> 40:32.500\n all of this is culturally influenced,\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:36.260\n but thinking more about the psychology and the neuroscience,\n\n40:36.260 --> 40:38.620\n there is probably something fundamental,\n\n40:38.620 --> 40:41.820\n like for someone that might be colored as elves,\n\n40:41.820 --> 40:44.020\n others that might be colored as,\n\n40:44.020 --> 40:46.860\n Terrence McKenna called them self dribbling basketballs.\n\n40:46.860 --> 40:49.220\n For someone else, it might be little animals\n\n40:49.220 --> 40:51.140\n or someone else, it might be aliens.\n\n40:52.140 --> 40:55.020\n I think that probably is dependent on who they are\n\n40:55.020 --> 40:56.060\n and what they've been exposed to.\n\n40:56.060 --> 40:58.860\n But just the fact that one has this sense\n\n40:58.860 --> 41:02.620\n that they're surrounded by autonomous entities.\n\n41:02.620 --> 41:04.580\n Right, intelligent autonomous entities.\n\n41:04.580 --> 41:06.500\n Right, and people come back with stories\n\n41:06.500 --> 41:09.340\n that are just astonishing.\n\n41:09.340 --> 41:12.580\n Like there's communication between these,\n\n41:12.580 --> 41:15.220\n communication between these entities\n\n41:15.220 --> 41:18.940\n and often they're telling them things\n\n41:18.940 --> 41:23.780\n that the person says are self validating,\n\n41:23.780 --> 41:25.900\n but it seems like it's impossible.\n\n41:25.900 --> 41:28.180\n Like it really seems like, and again,\n\n41:28.180 --> 41:31.060\n this is what people say oftentimes,\n\n41:31.060 --> 41:35.740\n that it really is like downloading some intelligence\n\n41:35.740 --> 41:39.020\n from a higher dimension or some whatever metaphor\n\n41:39.020 --> 41:39.860\n you wanna use.\n\n41:39.860 --> 41:41.540\n Sometimes these things come up in dreams\n\n41:41.540 --> 41:43.660\n like someone is exposed to something that,\n\n41:43.660 --> 41:45.740\n I've had this in a dream,\n\n41:45.740 --> 41:48.620\n where it seems like what they are being exposed to\n\n41:48.620 --> 41:51.700\n is physically impossible,\n\n41:51.700 --> 41:56.020\n but yet at the same time self validating, it seems true.\n\n41:56.020 --> 41:57.900\n Like they really are figuring something out.\n\n41:57.900 --> 41:59.940\n Of course, the challenge is to say something\n\n41:59.940 --> 42:03.540\n in concrete terms after the experience\n\n42:03.540 --> 42:07.060\n where you could verify that in any way.\n\n42:07.060 --> 42:10.980\n And I'm not familiar of any examples of that.\n\n42:10.980 --> 42:15.220\n Well, there's a sense in which I suppose the experience\n\n42:15.220 --> 42:20.220\n is like you're a limited cognitive creature\n\n42:22.380 --> 42:24.300\n that knows very little about the world\n\n42:24.300 --> 42:26.580\n and here's a chance to communicate\n\n42:26.580 --> 42:30.700\n with much wiser entities that in a way\n\n42:30.700 --> 42:32.260\n that you can't possibly understand\n\n42:32.260 --> 42:37.260\n are trying to give you hints of deeper truths.\n\n42:38.660 --> 42:40.540\n And so there's that kind of sense\n\n42:40.540 --> 42:42.340\n that you can take something back,\n\n42:42.340 --> 42:46.500\n but you can't where our cognition is not capable\n\n42:46.500 --> 42:48.420\n to fully grasp the truth.\n\n42:48.420 --> 42:50.540\n We'll just get a kind of sense of it\n\n42:50.540 --> 42:53.920\n and somehow that process is mind expanding\n\n42:53.920 --> 42:56.820\n that there's a greater truth out there.\n\n42:56.820 --> 42:59.540\n That seems like what from the people\n\n42:59.540 --> 43:04.140\n I've heard talk about that seems to be what it is.\n\n43:04.140 --> 43:08.320\n And that's so fascinating that there's fundamentally\n\n43:08.320 --> 43:09.980\n to this whole thing is a communication\n\n43:09.980 --> 43:14.980\n between an entity that is other than yourself, entities.\n\n43:15.460 --> 43:17.820\n So it's not just like a visual experience\n\n43:17.820 --> 43:21.100\n like you're like floating through the world\n\n43:21.100 --> 43:23.380\n is there's other beings there,\n\n43:23.380 --> 43:26.020\n which is kind of, I don't know.\n\n43:26.020 --> 43:27.980\n I don't know what to sort of,\n\n43:27.980 --> 43:30.700\n from a person who likes Freud and Carl Jung,\n\n43:30.700 --> 43:32.180\n I don't know what to think about that.\n\n43:32.180 --> 43:34.440\n That being of course from one perspective\n\n43:34.440 --> 43:36.680\n is just you looking in the mirror.\n\n43:36.680 --> 43:39.100\n But it could also be from another perspective\n\n43:39.100 --> 43:41.900\n like actually talking to other beings.\n\n43:41.900 --> 43:43.260\n Yeah, you mentioned Jung\n\n43:43.260 --> 43:45.660\n and I think he's particularly interesting\n\n43:45.660 --> 43:47.260\n and it kind of points to something\n\n43:47.260 --> 43:50.500\n I was thinking about saying is that,\n\n43:50.500 --> 43:52.500\n I think what might be going on\n\n43:52.500 --> 43:55.040\n from a naturalistic perspective.\n\n43:55.040 --> 43:58.660\n So regardless, whether or not there are,\n\n43:58.660 --> 44:01.660\n it doesn't depend on autonomous entities out there.\n\n44:01.660 --> 44:06.660\n What might be happening is that just the associative net,\n\n44:06.660 --> 44:08.980\n the level of learning,\n\n44:08.980 --> 44:13.980\n the comprehension might be so beyond what someone is used to\n\n44:17.180 --> 44:20.620\n that the only way for the nervous system,\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:25.620\n for the aware sense of self to orient towards it\n\n44:25.780 --> 44:27.500\n is all by metaphor.\n\n44:27.500 --> 44:29.020\n And so I do think,\n\n44:29.020 --> 44:33.220\n when we get into these realms as a strong empiricist,\n\n44:33.220 --> 44:34.900\n I think we always gotta be careful\n\n44:34.900 --> 44:36.700\n and be as grounded as possible,\n\n44:36.700 --> 44:39.260\n but I'm also willing to speculate\n\n44:39.260 --> 44:42.380\n and sort of cast the nets wide with caveat.\n\n44:42.380 --> 44:44.620\n But I think of things like archetypes\n\n44:44.620 --> 44:48.900\n and it's plausible that there are certain stories,\n\n44:48.900 --> 44:49.740\n there are certain,\n\n44:49.740 --> 44:52.980\n we've gone through millions of years of evolution.\n\n44:52.980 --> 44:57.980\n It may be that we have certain characters and stories\n\n44:58.140 --> 45:03.140\n that our central nervous system is sort of wired\n\n45:03.140 --> 45:05.020\n to tend to.\n\n45:05.020 --> 45:07.740\n Yeah, those stories, we carry those stories in us.\n\n45:07.740 --> 45:08.580\n Right.\n\n45:08.580 --> 45:10.460\n And this unlocks them in a certain kind of way.\n\n45:10.460 --> 45:11.900\n And we think about stories.\n\n45:11.900 --> 45:13.420\n Like our sense of self is basically,\n\n45:13.420 --> 45:15.060\n narrative self is a story.\n\n45:15.060 --> 45:18.700\n And we think about the world of stories.\n\n45:18.700 --> 45:20.660\n This is why metaphors are always more powerful\n\n45:20.660 --> 45:25.480\n than sort of laying out all the details all the time,\n\n45:25.480 --> 45:26.700\n speaking in parables.\n\n45:26.700 --> 45:28.460\n It's like, if you really get some,\n\n45:28.460 --> 45:31.100\n this is why, as much as I hate it,\n\n45:31.100 --> 45:33.340\n if you're presenting to Congress or something\n\n45:33.340 --> 45:36.780\n and you have all the best data in the world,\n\n45:36.780 --> 45:39.220\n it's not as powerful as that one anecdote\n\n45:39.220 --> 45:44.220\n as the mom dying of cancer that had the psilocybin session\n\n45:44.580 --> 45:46.540\n and it transformed her life.\n\n45:46.540 --> 45:48.520\n That's a story, that's meaningful.\n\n45:48.520 --> 45:53.260\n And so when this kind of unimaginable kind of change\n\n45:53.260 --> 45:58.260\n and experience happens with a DMT ingestion,\n\n45:58.260 --> 46:03.260\n these stories of entities, they might be that,\n\n46:04.740 --> 46:08.320\n stories that are constructed that is the closest,\n\n46:08.320 --> 46:09.980\n which is not to say the stories aren't real.\n\n46:09.980 --> 46:12.660\n I mean, I think we're getting to layers where\n\n46:12.660 --> 46:14.660\n it doesn't really, right.\n\n46:14.660 --> 46:17.880\n Yeah, but it's the closest we can come\n\n46:17.880 --> 46:19.100\n to making sense out of it.\n\n46:19.100 --> 46:22.260\n Because what we do know about these psychedelics,\n\n46:22.260 --> 46:24.060\n one of the levels beyond the receptor\n\n46:24.060 --> 46:26.380\n is that the brain is communicating it with itself\n\n46:26.380 --> 46:28.420\n in a massively different way.\n\n46:28.420 --> 46:30.460\n There's massive communication with areas\n\n46:30.460 --> 46:32.580\n that don't normally communicate.\n\n46:32.580 --> 46:36.900\n And so I think that comes with both,\n\n46:36.900 --> 46:38.620\n it's casting the nets wide.\n\n46:38.620 --> 46:41.020\n I think that comes with the insights\n\n46:41.020 --> 46:42.760\n and helpful novel ways of thinking.\n\n46:42.760 --> 46:45.300\n I do think it comes with false positives,\n\n46:45.300 --> 46:47.120\n that could be some of the delusion.\n\n46:48.680 --> 46:52.200\n And so when you're so far out there,\n\n46:52.200 --> 46:53.740\n like with the DMT experience,\n\n46:53.740 --> 46:58.660\n like maybe alien is the best way\n\n46:58.660 --> 47:02.500\n that the mind can wrap some arms around that.\n\n47:02.500 --> 47:05.660\n So I don't know how much you're familiar with Joe Rogan,\n\n47:05.660 --> 47:08.340\n but he does bring up DMT quite a bit.\n\n47:08.340 --> 47:11.160\n It's almost a meme, it is a meme.\n\n47:11.160 --> 47:14.020\n Have you ever, what is it, have you ever tried DMT?\n\n47:16.260 --> 47:18.620\n I mean, I think he talks about this experience\n\n47:18.620 --> 47:22.340\n of having met other entities\n\n47:22.340 --> 47:26.540\n and they were mocking him, I think,\n\n47:26.540 --> 47:28.680\n if I remember the experience correctly,\n\n47:28.680 --> 47:31.180\n like laughing at him and saying F you, F you,\n\n47:31.180 --> 47:32.740\n or something like that.\n\n47:32.740 --> 47:34.300\n I may be misremembering this,\n\n47:34.300 --> 47:37.260\n but there's a general mockery.\n\n47:37.260 --> 47:40.260\n And what he learned from that experience\n\n47:40.260 --> 47:42.600\n is that he shouldn't take himself too seriously.\n\n47:42.600 --> 47:45.440\n So it's the dissolution of the ego and so on.\n\n47:45.440 --> 47:48.820\n Like what do you think about that experience?\n\n47:48.820 --> 47:50.620\n And maybe if you have more general things\n\n47:50.620 --> 47:54.620\n about Joe's infatuation with DMT\n\n47:54.620 --> 47:58.700\n and if DMT has that important role to play\n\n47:58.700 --> 48:01.980\n in popular culture in general.\n\n48:01.980 --> 48:03.420\n I'm definitely familiar with it.\n\n48:03.420 --> 48:04.980\n I remember telling you offline\n\n48:04.980 --> 48:07.780\n that when I first, the first time I learned\n\n48:07.780 --> 48:11.460\n who Joe Rogan was, it was probably 15 years ago.\n\n48:11.460 --> 48:14.180\n And I came upon a clip and I realized\n\n48:14.180 --> 48:15.780\n there's another person in the world\n\n48:15.780 --> 48:19.020\n who's into both DMT and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.\n\n48:19.020 --> 48:22.220\n And I think both those worlds have grown dramatically since\n\n48:22.220 --> 48:24.440\n and it's probably not such a special club these days.\n\n48:24.440 --> 48:29.020\n So he definitely got onto my radar screen quickly.\n\n48:29.020 --> 48:31.980\n You were into both before it was cool.\n\n48:31.980 --> 48:33.820\n Right, I mean, this is all relative\n\n48:33.820 --> 48:36.500\n because there's people that were before the late 90s\n\n48:36.500 --> 48:37.820\n and early 2000s who were into it\n\n48:37.820 --> 48:39.400\n to say you're a Johnny come lately.\n\n48:39.400 --> 48:42.460\n But yeah, compared to where we're at now.\n\n48:42.460 --> 48:44.940\n But yet one of the things I always found fascinating\n\n48:44.940 --> 48:49.940\n by Joe's telling of his experiences I think\n\n48:52.020 --> 48:54.500\n is that they resemble very much\n\n48:54.500 --> 48:57.860\n Terrence McKenna's experiences with DMT\n\n48:57.860 --> 49:01.020\n and Joe has talked very much about Terrence McKenna\n\n49:01.020 --> 49:03.260\n and his experiences.\n\n49:03.260 --> 49:04.660\n If I had to guess, I would guess\n\n49:04.660 --> 49:08.540\n that probably just having heard Terrence McKenna\n\n49:08.540 --> 49:13.020\n talk about his experiences that that influenced\n\n49:13.020 --> 49:15.660\n the coloring of Joe's experience.\n\n49:15.660 --> 49:17.220\n It's funny how that works\n\n49:17.220 --> 49:19.980\n because I mean, that's why McKenna hasn't,\n\n49:19.980 --> 49:24.980\n I mean, poets and great orators give us the words\n\n49:25.020 --> 49:27.540\n to then like start to describe our experiences\n\n49:27.540 --> 49:30.620\n because our words are limited, our language is limited.\n\n49:30.620 --> 49:33.220\n And it's always nice to get some kind of nice poetry\n\n49:33.220 --> 49:36.360\n into the mix to allow us to put words to it.\n\n49:36.360 --> 49:40.060\n Right, but I also see some elements\n\n49:40.060 --> 49:43.180\n that seem to relate to Joe's psychology\n\n49:43.180 --> 49:46.220\n just from what I've seen from hours\n\n49:46.220 --> 49:47.880\n of watching him on his podcast\n\n49:47.880 --> 49:52.340\n is that he's a self critical guy.\n\n49:52.340 --> 49:54.100\n And I think with always his positive been,\n\n49:54.100 --> 49:56.900\n I'm always struck being a behavioral pharmacologist\n\n49:56.900 --> 49:59.180\n and no one else really says it about cannabis.\n\n49:59.180 --> 50:00.780\n I'll get back to the DMT thing about\n\n50:00.780 --> 50:03.300\n he likes the kind of the paranoid side of things.\n\n50:03.300 --> 50:05.820\n He's like, that's you radically examining yourself.\n\n50:05.820 --> 50:07.540\n It's like, that's not just a bad thing.\n\n50:07.540 --> 50:09.940\n That's you need to like look hard at yourself\n\n50:09.940 --> 50:11.780\n and something's making you uncomfortable,\n\n50:11.780 --> 50:13.060\n like dig into that.\n\n50:13.060 --> 50:14.180\n And like, that's his,\n\n50:14.180 --> 50:16.860\n it's sort of along the lines of Goggins with exercise.\n\n50:16.860 --> 50:19.100\n And it's like, yeah, like things,\n\n50:19.100 --> 50:21.620\n learning experiences aren't supposed to be easy.\n\n50:21.620 --> 50:24.780\n Like take advantage of these uncomfortable experience.\n\n50:24.780 --> 50:26.620\n It's why we call in our research\n\n50:26.620 --> 50:28.700\n in a safe context with psychedelics,\n\n50:28.700 --> 50:32.220\n they're not bad trips, they're challenging experiences.\n\n50:32.220 --> 50:33.820\n Yes, yeah, that's fascinating.\n\n50:33.820 --> 50:35.980\n Just that's the tiny tangent.\n\n50:35.980 --> 50:40.780\n It's always cool for me to hear him talk about marijuana,\n\n50:40.780 --> 50:44.540\n like weed as the paranoia, the anxiety or whatever\n\n50:44.540 --> 50:49.540\n that you experience as actually the fuel for the experience.\n\n50:50.580 --> 50:54.420\n Like I think he talks about smoking weed when he's writing.\n\n50:54.420 --> 50:56.220\n That's inspiring to me because\n\n50:56.220 --> 50:59.460\n then you can't possibly have a bad experience.\n\n50:59.460 --> 51:00.500\n I'm a huge fan of that.\n\n51:00.500 --> 51:02.420\n Like every experience is good.\n\n51:03.380 --> 51:04.780\n Right, which is very Goggins.\n\n51:04.780 --> 51:06.540\n Yeah, yeah, is it bad?\n\n51:06.540 --> 51:08.300\n Okay, all right, great, you know.\n\n51:08.300 --> 51:09.980\n Well, see Goggins is one side of that.\n\n51:09.980 --> 51:11.740\n He wants it bad.\n\n51:11.740 --> 51:14.860\n Like he wants the experience to be challenging always.\n\n51:14.860 --> 51:17.500\n But I mean like both are good.\n\n51:17.500 --> 51:21.700\n Like the few times of taking mushrooms,\n\n51:21.700 --> 51:26.340\n the experience was like everything was beautiful.\n\n51:26.340 --> 51:29.900\n There's zero challenging aspect to it.\n\n51:29.900 --> 51:32.020\n It was just like the world is beautiful\n\n51:32.020 --> 51:35.020\n and it gave me this deep appreciation of the world.\n\n51:35.020 --> 51:37.740\n I would say, so like that's amazing,\n\n51:37.740 --> 51:41.180\n but also ones that challenge you are also amazing.\n\n51:41.180 --> 51:42.580\n Like all the times I drink vodka,\n\n51:42.580 --> 51:45.900\n but that's another, let's not.\n\n51:45.900 --> 51:47.340\n So back to DMT.\n\n51:48.260 --> 51:52.180\n Yeah, Joe's treating cannabis as a psychedelic,\n\n51:52.180 --> 51:54.820\n which is something that I'd say like a lot of people\n\n51:54.820 --> 51:59.820\n treat it more like Xanax or like beer or vodka.\n\n51:59.820 --> 52:03.940\n But he's really trying to delve into those minor,\n\n52:03.940 --> 52:05.260\n it's been called a minor psychedelic.\n\n52:05.260 --> 52:07.740\n So with DMT, as you brought up,\n\n52:07.740 --> 52:10.220\n it's like the entity's mocking him.\n\n52:10.220 --> 52:13.580\n And it's like, you're not, I mean, this reminds me of him,\n\n52:13.580 --> 52:16.780\n him describing his, like writing his,\n\n52:16.780 --> 52:20.940\n or just his entire method of comedy.\n\n52:20.940 --> 52:23.540\n It's like, watch the tape of yourself.\n\n52:23.540 --> 52:24.580\n Don't just ignore it.\n\n52:24.580 --> 52:26.740\n Like that's where I screwed up.\n\n52:26.740 --> 52:28.020\n That's where I need to do better.\n\n52:28.020 --> 52:31.180\n This like sort of radical self examination,\n\n52:31.180 --> 52:33.460\n which I think our society is kind of getting away from\n\n52:33.460 --> 52:36.580\n because like, all the children win trophies type of thing.\n\n52:36.580 --> 52:39.140\n And it's like, no, no, don't go overboard,\n\n52:39.140 --> 52:41.740\n but like recognize when you've messed up.\n\n52:41.740 --> 52:45.260\n And so that's a big part of the psychedelic experience.\n\n52:45.260 --> 52:48.340\n Like people come out sometimes saying,\n\n52:48.340 --> 52:50.540\n my God, I need to say sorry to my mom.\n\n52:52.380 --> 52:57.380\n It's so obvious, or whatever interpersonal issue\n\n52:57.380 --> 53:00.420\n or like, my God, I'm not pulling enough weight\n\n53:00.420 --> 53:02.780\n around the house and helping my wife.\n\n53:02.780 --> 53:07.160\n And these things that are just obvious to them,\n\n53:07.160 --> 53:09.820\n the self criticism that can be a very positive thing\n\n53:09.820 --> 53:10.860\n if you act on it.\n\n53:12.020 --> 53:13.580\n You've mentioned addiction.\n\n53:13.580 --> 53:15.380\n Maybe we could take a little bit detour\n\n53:15.380 --> 53:18.180\n into a darker aspect of things,\n\n53:18.180 --> 53:22.260\n or not even darker, it's just an important aspect of things.\n\n53:22.260 --> 53:24.740\n What's the nature of addiction?\n\n53:24.740 --> 53:28.980\n You've mentioned some things within the big umbrella\n\n53:28.980 --> 53:32.580\n of psychedelics may be usually not addictive,\n\n53:32.580 --> 53:35.140\n but maybe MDMA, I think you said\n\n53:35.140 --> 53:37.180\n might have some addictive properties,\n\n53:37.180 --> 53:41.060\n but the point is stuff outside of the psychedelics umbrella\n\n53:41.060 --> 53:43.940\n can often be highly addictive.\n\n53:43.940 --> 53:47.360\n So you've studied addiction from several angles,\n\n53:47.360 --> 53:49.820\n one of which is behavioral economics.\n\n53:49.820 --> 53:53.700\n What have you understood about addiction?\n\n53:53.700 --> 53:57.980\n What is addiction from the biological physiological level\n\n53:57.980 --> 54:00.860\n to the psychological to whatever is the interesting way\n\n54:00.860 --> 54:02.560\n to talk about addiction?\n\n54:02.560 --> 54:05.680\n Yeah, and the lenses that I view addiction through\n\n54:05.680 --> 54:08.700\n very much are behavioral economic,\n\n54:08.700 --> 54:11.420\n but I also think they converge on,\n\n54:11.420 --> 54:13.500\n I think it's beautiful at the other end of the spectrum,\n\n54:13.500 --> 54:18.500\n sort of just a completely humanistic psychology perspective.\n\n54:20.420 --> 54:22.780\n It converges on what people come out of,\n\n54:22.780 --> 54:24.740\n 12 step meetings talking about.\n\n54:24.740 --> 54:27.340\n Can you say what is behavioral economics\n\n54:27.340 --> 54:30.020\n and what is humanistic psychology?\n\n54:30.020 --> 54:31.060\n Like, what do you mean by that?\n\n54:31.060 --> 54:33.820\n And more importantly, behavioral economics lens,\n\n54:33.820 --> 54:34.660\n what is that?\n\n54:34.660 --> 54:36.140\n Yeah, so behavioral economics,\n\n54:36.140 --> 54:38.260\n my definition of it is the application\n\n54:38.260 --> 54:41.600\n of economic principles, mostly microeconomic principles.\n\n54:41.600 --> 54:46.600\n So understanding the behavior of individual agents\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:51.520\n surrounding commodities in the marketplace,\n\n54:51.520 --> 54:55.500\n applying microeconomic types of analyses\n\n54:56.380 --> 54:59.900\n to non economic behavior.\n\n54:59.900 --> 55:01.660\n So basically at one point,\n\n55:01.660 --> 55:03.460\n like psychologists figured out\n\n55:03.460 --> 55:05.540\n that there's this whole other discipline\n\n55:05.540 --> 55:06.780\n that's been studying behavior,\n\n55:06.780 --> 55:09.540\n it just happened to be all focused on monetary behavior,\n\n55:09.540 --> 55:12.400\n spending and saving money, et cetera.\n\n55:12.400 --> 55:14.540\n But it comes with all of these like principles\n\n55:14.540 --> 55:17.700\n that can be wildly and fruitfully applied\n\n55:17.700 --> 55:18.940\n to understanding behavior.\n\n55:18.940 --> 55:21.500\n So for example, I've studied things like\n\n55:22.660 --> 55:25.020\n demand curve analysis of drug consumption.\n\n55:25.020 --> 55:30.020\n So I look at, for example, tobacco, cigarettes\n\n55:30.440 --> 55:35.340\n and nicotine products through the lens of demand curves.\n\n55:35.340 --> 55:38.340\n And in other words, at different prices,\n\n55:38.340 --> 55:40.660\n if there's different work requirements\n\n55:40.660 --> 55:45.660\n for being able to smoke cigarettes, sort of modeling price.\n\n55:45.900 --> 55:47.120\n Within that price data,\n\n55:47.120 --> 55:49.500\n there is some indication of addiction,\n\n55:49.500 --> 55:52.100\n how much the habits that you form\n\n55:52.100 --> 55:54.600\n around these particular drugs.\n\n55:54.600 --> 55:56.380\n It's one important dimension.\n\n55:56.380 --> 55:58.100\n So I think a particularly important one there\n\n55:58.100 --> 56:02.660\n is elasticity or inelasticity, two ends of the spectrum.\n\n56:02.660 --> 56:05.340\n So that's the price sensitivity.\n\n56:05.340 --> 56:07.740\n So for example, you could have something\n\n56:07.740 --> 56:12.740\n that's pretty price inelastic, like gasoline.\n\n56:14.660 --> 56:16.940\n So the price of gas at times can keep going up\n\n56:16.940 --> 56:20.500\n and Americans are just gonna pretty much\n\n56:20.500 --> 56:21.540\n buy the same amount of gas.\n\n56:21.540 --> 56:24.100\n Or maybe the price of gas doubles,\n\n56:24.100 --> 56:26.260\n but their consumption only decreases by 10%.\n\n56:26.260 --> 56:28.640\n So it's a sub proportional reduction.\n\n56:28.640 --> 56:30.500\n So that's an inelastic.\n\n56:30.500 --> 56:33.240\n And that changes, like you push the price up high enough.\n\n56:33.240 --> 56:35.900\n I mean, if it was $100 a gallon, it would eventually turn,\n\n56:35.900 --> 56:39.780\n the curve would turn and go downward more drastically\n\n56:39.780 --> 56:41.420\n and it would be elastic.\n\n56:41.420 --> 56:45.100\n But you can apply that to someone who,\n\n56:45.100 --> 56:49.340\n a regular cigarette smoker who was working\n\n56:49.340 --> 56:52.620\n for cigarette puffs, who's gone six hours without smoking.\n\n56:52.620 --> 56:54.700\n And you're asking questions like,\n\n56:54.700 --> 56:57.620\n how many times are they willing to pull this knob\n\n56:57.620 --> 56:59.300\n in the lab during this three hour session?\n\n56:59.300 --> 57:02.420\n I do a lot of work like this in order to earn a cigarette.\n\n57:02.420 --> 57:05.400\n How does the content of nicotine in that affect?\n\n57:05.400 --> 57:08.360\n It has the availability of nicotine replacement products\n\n57:08.360 --> 57:12.460\n like nicotine gum or eCigarettes affect those decisions.\n\n57:12.460 --> 57:15.540\n So it's a certain lens of, it's sort of a way to take\n\n57:15.540 --> 57:19.700\n the kind of the classic behavioral psychology definition\n\n57:19.700 --> 57:24.260\n of reinforcement, which is just basically reward.\n\n57:24.260 --> 57:25.480\n How much is this a good thing?\n\n57:25.480 --> 57:26.860\n And it kind of breaks that apart\n\n57:26.860 --> 57:31.040\n into a multi dimensional space.\n\n57:31.040 --> 57:34.560\n So it's not just the ideas reward or reinforcement\n\n57:34.560 --> 57:36.160\n is not unit dimensional.\n\n57:36.160 --> 57:39.540\n So for example, you can unpack that with demand curves.\n\n57:39.540 --> 57:44.160\n At a cheap price, you might prefer one good to another.\n\n57:44.160 --> 57:47.020\n So the classic example is luxury versus necessity.\n\n57:47.020 --> 57:49.540\n So diamonds versus toilet paper.\n\n57:49.540 --> 57:51.420\n So at those cheap prices,\n\n57:51.420 --> 57:54.100\n you can look at something called intensity of demand.\n\n57:54.100 --> 57:56.220\n If it was basically as cheap as possible,\n\n57:56.220 --> 57:59.940\n or essentially zero, how much would you buy of this good?\n\n57:59.940 --> 58:02.800\n But then you keep jacking up the price and you'll see,\n\n58:02.800 --> 58:06.240\n so diamonds will look like the better reward\n\n58:06.240 --> 58:09.960\n at that low price sort of intensity of demand side of things.\n\n58:09.960 --> 58:11.420\n But as you keep jacking up the price,\n\n58:11.420 --> 58:13.260\n you gotta have some toilet paper.\n\n58:13.260 --> 58:15.700\n And again, we can get into the whole bidet thing,\n\n58:15.700 --> 58:19.500\n but forget that, I know Joe's been pushing that too.\n\n58:21.100 --> 58:23.980\n You're gonna hang on and keep buying the toilet paper\n\n58:23.980 --> 58:26.660\n to a greater degree than you will the diamonds.\n\n58:26.660 --> 58:28.900\n So you'll see a crossing of demand curves.\n\n58:28.900 --> 58:30.860\n So what's the better reinforcer?\n\n58:30.860 --> 58:31.820\n What's the better reward?\n\n58:31.820 --> 58:33.620\n Depends on your price.\n\n58:33.620 --> 58:38.620\n And so that's an example of one way to look at addiction.\n\n58:39.500 --> 58:41.880\n So specifically drug consumption,\n\n58:41.880 --> 58:43.500\n which isn't all of addiction,\n\n58:43.500 --> 58:46.500\n but it's like in order for something to be addictive,\n\n58:46.500 --> 58:48.860\n it has to be a reward.\n\n58:48.860 --> 58:53.860\n And it has to compete with other rewards in your life.\n\n58:54.300 --> 58:59.220\n And one of the two main aspects of addiction in my view,\n\n58:59.220 --> 59:01.700\n and this doesn't map onto how the DSM,\n\n59:01.700 --> 59:04.540\n the psychiatry Bible defines addiction,\n\n59:04.540 --> 59:06.460\n which I think is largely bunk,\n\n59:06.460 --> 59:08.800\n but there's some value to have some common description,\n\n59:08.800 --> 59:12.100\n but it's how rewarding is it\n\n59:12.100 --> 59:15.260\n from this multi dimensional lens?\n\n59:15.260 --> 59:19.820\n And specifically, how does that rewarding value compete\n\n59:19.820 --> 59:24.820\n with other rewards, other consequences in your life?\n\n59:25.140 --> 59:30.140\n So it's not a problem if the use of that substance\n\n59:30.140 --> 59:32.340\n is rewarding.\n\n59:32.340 --> 59:33.980\n Okay, yeah, you like to have a couple of beers\n\n59:33.980 --> 59:36.580\n every once in a while, and it's like not a problem.\n\n59:38.140 --> 59:42.720\n But then you have the alcoholic who is drinking so much\n\n59:42.720 --> 59:47.660\n that it tanks their career, it ruins their marriage.\n\n59:47.660 --> 59:51.520\n It's in competition with these pro social aspects\n\n59:51.520 --> 59:52.360\n to their life.\n\n59:52.360 --> 59:55.820\n It's all about comparing to the other choices you're making,\n\n59:55.820 --> 59:57.820\n the other activities in your life.\n\n59:57.820 --> 1:00:01.340\n And if you evaluate it as a much higher reward\n\n1:00:02.860 --> 1:00:05.380\n than anything else, that becomes an addiction.\n\n1:00:05.380 --> 1:00:06.220\n Right, right.\n\n1:00:06.220 --> 1:00:08.260\n And so it's not just the rewarding value,\n\n1:00:08.260 --> 1:00:10.020\n but it's the relative rewarding value.\n\n1:00:10.020 --> 1:00:13.780\n And the other major aspect, again, from behavioral economics,\n\n1:00:13.780 --> 1:00:16.420\n that the thing that makes addiction\n\n1:00:16.420 --> 1:00:20.380\n is something called delayed discounting.\n\n1:00:20.380 --> 1:00:23.460\n So in economics, sometimes it's called time preference.\n\n1:00:23.460 --> 1:00:26.820\n It's what compound interest rates are based upon.\n\n1:00:26.820 --> 1:00:30.500\n It's the idea that delaying a good access to a good\n\n1:00:30.500 --> 1:00:35.180\n or a reward comes with a certain decrement to its value.\n\n1:00:35.180 --> 1:00:37.760\n So we'd all rather have things now than later.\n\n1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:42.140\n And we can study this at the individual level of,\n\n1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:47.140\n would you rather have $9 today or $10 tomorrow?\n\n1:00:48.660 --> 1:00:52.780\n And when you do that, you get huge differences\n\n1:00:52.780 --> 1:00:56.420\n between addicted populations and non addicted,\n\n1:00:56.420 --> 1:00:59.420\n not just heroin and cocaine, but like just cigarette smokers,\n\n1:00:59.420 --> 1:01:02.100\n like normal everyday cigarette smokers.\n\n1:01:02.100 --> 1:01:06.380\n And even when you look at something like monetary rewards.\n\n1:01:06.380 --> 1:01:08.340\n And so you can go into the rabbit hole\n\n1:01:08.340 --> 1:01:10.640\n with this delayed discounting model.\n\n1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:12.340\n So it's not only those huge differences\n\n1:01:12.340 --> 1:01:15.260\n that seem to have a face valid aspect to it.\n\n1:01:15.260 --> 1:01:17.460\n Like the cigarette smoker is choosing this thing\n\n1:01:17.460 --> 1:01:19.460\n that's rewarding today,\n\n1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:21.360\n but I know it comes with increased risk\n\n1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:24.020\n of having these horrible consequences down the line.\n\n1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:26.420\n So it's this competition between what's good for me now\n\n1:01:26.420 --> 1:01:28.460\n and what's good for me later.\n\n1:01:28.460 --> 1:01:30.500\n And the other aspect about delayed discounting\n\n1:01:30.500 --> 1:01:33.620\n is that if you quantitatively map out\n\n1:01:33.620 --> 1:01:37.220\n that discounting curve over time,\n\n1:01:37.220 --> 1:01:42.220\n so you don't just do that $10 tomorrow,\n\n1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:45.180\n how much is it worth to you today?\n\n1:01:45.180 --> 1:01:46.420\n So you can say, what about nine?\n\n1:01:46.420 --> 1:01:47.260\n What about eight?\n\n1:01:47.260 --> 1:01:48.180\n What about $7?\n\n1:01:48.180 --> 1:01:51.020\n And you can titrate it to find that indifference point.\n\n1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:56.020\n And so we can say, aha, $10 tomorrow is worth $6 today.\n\n1:01:57.660 --> 1:02:00.980\n So it's by the one day it's decreased by 40%.\n\n1:02:00.980 --> 1:02:04.140\n We can do that also at one week and one month\n\n1:02:04.140 --> 1:02:08.400\n and one year and 10 years and map out that curve,\n\n1:02:08.400 --> 1:02:09.620\n get a shape of that curve.\n\n1:02:09.620 --> 1:02:11.420\n And one of the fascinating things about this\n\n1:02:11.420 --> 1:02:13.620\n is that whether you're talking about pigeons,\n\n1:02:13.620 --> 1:02:14.860\n making these types of choices\n\n1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:16.220\n between a little bit of food now\n\n1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:18.660\n or a little bit of food a minute from now or rats,\n\n1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.580\n or like dozens of species of animals tested,\n\n1:02:21.580 --> 1:02:22.940\n including humans,\n\n1:02:22.940 --> 1:02:24.820\n the tendency is pretty consistently\n\n1:02:24.820 --> 1:02:29.820\n that we discount hyperbolically rather than exponentially.\n\n1:02:31.220 --> 1:02:34.520\n And what exponentially means is that every unit of time\n\n1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:37.540\n is associated with the same proportional reduction.\n\n1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:40.220\n Every unit of delay is associated with the same,\n\n1:02:40.220 --> 1:02:42.860\n causes the same proportional reduction in value.\n\n1:02:42.860 --> 1:02:47.000\n And that's the way the compound interest rate works.\n\n1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000\n Every day you get this sort of out of whatever values\n\n1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:54.780\n in there at the beginning of that day,\n\n1:02:54.780 --> 1:02:58.560\n you get this, we'll give you this amount of extra money\n\n1:02:58.560 --> 1:03:01.340\n to compensate you for that delay.\n\n1:03:01.340 --> 1:03:05.520\n But then the way that all animals tend to function\n\n1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:09.480\n is of this very different way where the reductions,\n\n1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:11.880\n the initial, that initial delay,\n\n1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:13.680\n so like one day's worth of delay,\n\n1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:16.600\n you see a much stronger discounting rate\n\n1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:20.440\n or reduction in value than you do over those.\n\n1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:22.040\n So you see the super proportional,\n\n1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:26.200\n then it changes to these lesser rates.\n\n1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:27.480\n And so the implication of that,\n\n1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:29.760\n I know I've gone like really into the weeds quantitatively,\n\n1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:31.160\n but what that means is that\n\n1:03:32.640 --> 1:03:34.280\n there's these preference reversals.\n\n1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:36.460\n When you have curves of that nature,\n\n1:03:37.360 --> 1:03:40.600\n the decay that's hyperbolic,\n\n1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.600\n it maps onto this phenomenon we see\n\n1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:49.720\n both in terms of how people deal with future rewards,\n\n1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:51.780\n but also how perception works.\n\n1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:54.200\n When two things are far away,\n\n1:03:54.200 --> 1:03:56.320\n whether it's physical distance\n\n1:03:56.320 --> 1:03:57.760\n or whether in terms of perception\n\n1:03:57.760 --> 1:03:59.840\n or whether it's in terms of time,\n\n1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:01.860\n when you're really far away,\n\n1:04:01.860 --> 1:04:05.680\n the value, the subjective value for that further,\n\n1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:08.960\n that delayed reward is larger.\n\n1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.240\n So for example, like,\n\n1:04:11.240 --> 1:04:13.880\n let's say we're talking about 360,\n\n1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:20.080\n 364 days from now, you can get $9 or 365 days a year.\n\n1:04:21.680 --> 1:04:23.600\n Now you get $10 and you're like,\n\n1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.780\n dude, it's like, it's a year, like no difference.\n\n1:04:25.780 --> 1:04:29.040\n Like I'll take, why not get one more dollar?\n\n1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:31.500\n You bring that same exact set of choices closer.\n\n1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:34.400\n Nothing's changed other than the time to both rewards.\n\n1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:37.480\n And it's like, would you rather have $9 today\n\n1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:39.760\n or $10 tomorrow and plenty of people would say,\n\n1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:43.160\n eh, just about the same, let's go ahead and take it today.\n\n1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:45.000\n So you see this preference reversal.\n\n1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:50.000\n And so that's a model of addiction\n\n1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:55.000\n in the sense that consistently with true addiction,\n\n1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.160\n I would argue, you see this competition\n\n1:04:58.160 --> 1:05:01.680\n between molar and molecular utility.\n\n1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:05.400\n It's like interpersonal,\n\n1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:07.920\n like within the person competing agents.\n\n1:05:07.920 --> 1:05:10.340\n Someone sometimes has control of the bus\n\n1:05:10.340 --> 1:05:14.400\n that wants to do what's good for you in the short term.\n\n1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:18.200\n And someone at other times is in control of driving the bus\n\n1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:22.480\n and they want to do what's good for you in the long term.\n\n1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:25.240\n So you tell the, you're trying to quit\n\n1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:28.360\n and you see a doctor, you see your 12 step therapist\n\n1:05:28.360 --> 1:05:30.880\n and say, God, I know this stuff is killing me.\n\n1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:35.560\n Like, I'm really, I'm on the path, like I'm done.\n\n1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:37.080\n And that's when you're kind of in their office\n\n1:05:37.080 --> 1:05:39.200\n or wherever you're not, it's not around you.\n\n1:05:39.200 --> 1:05:41.320\n And then later on that day, your buddy says that,\n\n1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:42.640\n hey man, I just scored.\n\n1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:43.480\n I got it right here.\n\n1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:44.320\n Do you want it?\n\n1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:45.480\n And that reward is right in front of you.\n\n1:05:45.480 --> 1:05:48.200\n That's like bringing those two choices right in front of you.\n\n1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:50.520\n And it's like, hell yeah, I want to use.\n\n1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.840\n And then you can go through that cycle for like years\n\n1:05:52.840 --> 1:05:56.400\n of the person telling themselves, I want to quit.\n\n1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:58.800\n But then other times that same person is saying,\n\n1:05:58.800 --> 1:06:01.080\n I don't want to, you know, functionally,\n\n1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:01.920\n they're saying, I don't want to,\n\n1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:04.200\n because they're saying, yeah, like, yeah, give me some.\n\n1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:07.160\n So in the moment, it's very difficult to quit.\n\n1:06:07.160 --> 1:06:08.400\n And this isn't just something,\n\n1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:11.080\n this is something that has huge clinical ramifications\n\n1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:13.400\n with addiction, but it's like all humans do it.\n\n1:06:13.400 --> 1:06:15.680\n Anyone who's hit the snooze alarm in the morning,\n\n1:06:15.680 --> 1:06:17.720\n like the night before they realize,\n\n1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.560\n oh, I got to get up extra early tomorrow.\n\n1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:21.320\n That's what's ultimately better for me.\n\n1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:24.000\n So I'm going to set the alarm for, you know, 5 a.m.\n\n1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:29.000\n And it goes off at 5 a.m., you know,\n\n1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:34.680\n and then, so now those two consequences have come sooner\n\n1:06:34.680 --> 1:06:35.960\n and it's like, what the hell?\n\n1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:37.360\n And they hit the snooze alarm.\n\n1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:38.400\n And sometimes not just once,\n\n1:06:38.400 --> 1:06:41.200\n but then five minutes later and five minutes later,\n\n1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:43.440\n you know, and so, and it's why it's easier\n\n1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:46.880\n to exercise self control at the grocery store\n\n1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:48.680\n compared to in your fridge.\n\n1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:53.680\n Like if that snack is like 30 seconds away in your fridge,\n\n1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:58.080\n you're going to more likely yield to temptation\n\n1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:01.000\n than if it is further away.\n\n1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.520\n So then just take a step back to something\n\n1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:07.020\n you brought up earlier, the inelasticity of pricing.\n\n1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:12.120\n Is it from a perspective of the dealers,\n\n1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:14.480\n whether we're talking about cigarettes\n\n1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:19.480\n or maybe venturing slightly into the illegal realm,\n\n1:07:20.300 --> 1:07:23.120\n you know, of people who sell drugs illegally,\n\n1:07:23.120 --> 1:07:25.520\n they also have an economics to them\n\n1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.060\n that they set prices and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:07:29.080 --> 1:07:34.080\n Does addiction allow you to mess with the nature of pricing?\n\n1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:39.480\n Like, so I kind of assume that you meant\n\n1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:42.360\n that there's a correlation between things you're addicted to\n\n1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:44.640\n and the inelasticity of the price.\n\n1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.720\n So you can jack up the price.\n\n1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.040\n Is there something interesting to be said\n\n1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:52.920\n both for legal drugs and illegal drugs\n\n1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:57.920\n about the kind of price games you can play\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:03.920\n because the consumers of the product are addicted?\n\n1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:06.260\n Right, I mean, I think you just described it.\n\n1:08:06.260 --> 1:08:07.760\n Yeah, you can jack up the price\n\n1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:10.880\n and you know, some people are going to drop off,\n\n1:08:10.880 --> 1:08:13.560\n but the people, you know, and it's not dichotomous\n\n1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:15.280\n because you could just consume less,\n\n1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:16.920\n but some people are going to consume less\n\n1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:19.920\n and the people that are most addicted are going to keep,\n\n1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:21.840\n you know, I mean, you see this,\n\n1:08:21.840 --> 1:08:23.440\n they're going to keep purchasing.\n\n1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:24.620\n So you see this with cigarettes.\n\n1:08:24.620 --> 1:08:28.080\n And so it's interesting when you interface this with policy,\n\n1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:31.280\n like in one respect, heavily taxing cigarettes\n\n1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:32.120\n is a good thing.\n\n1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:36.060\n We know it keeps adolescents particularly price sensitive.\n\n1:08:36.060 --> 1:08:38.800\n So you definitely, people smoke less\n\n1:08:38.800 --> 1:08:41.140\n and especially kids smoke less when you keep\n\n1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:44.240\n cigarette prices high and you tax the hell out of them.\n\n1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:46.760\n But one of the downsides you've got to balance\n\n1:08:46.760 --> 1:08:49.980\n and keep in mind is that you disproportionately\n\n1:08:49.980 --> 1:08:52.820\n have working class, poor people.\n\n1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:54.960\n And then you get into a point where someone's spending,\n\n1:08:54.960 --> 1:08:56.600\n you know, a quarter of their paycheck on cigarettes.\n\n1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:58.640\n So they're going to smoke no matter what.\n\n1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:01.040\n And basically because they're addicted,\n\n1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:02.080\n they're going to smoke no matter what.\n\n1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.360\n And you're just, yeah, you're taxing their existence.\n\n1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:08.200\n Right, so you're making it worse for them.\n\n1:09:08.200 --> 1:09:10.540\n If they don't, if they are completely inelastic,\n\n1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:12.800\n you're actually making that person's life worse.\n\n1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:16.180\n Because we know that by interfering with the amount\n\n1:09:16.180 --> 1:09:19.640\n of money they have, you're interfering with the other\n\n1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:23.920\n pro social, the potential competitors to smoking, you know.\n\n1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:26.560\n And we know that when someone's in more impoverished\n\n1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:31.280\n environments and they have less sort of non drug alternatives,\n\n1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:34.120\n you know, the more likely they're going to stay addicted.\n\n1:09:34.120 --> 1:09:35.760\n So, you know.\n\n1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.900\n Is there data, this is interesting,\n\n1:09:38.900 --> 1:09:42.760\n from a scientific perspective of those same kind of games\n\n1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:44.520\n in illegal drugs?\n\n1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:50.000\n Sort of, because that's where most drug,\n\n1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.180\n I was, I mean, I don't know, maybe you can correct me,\n\n1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:56.360\n but it seems like most drugs are currently illegal.\n\n1:09:56.360 --> 1:10:00.240\n And so, but there's still an economics to them, obviously.\n\n1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:01.800\n That's the drug war and so on.\n\n1:10:01.800 --> 1:10:05.200\n Is there data on the setting of prices\n\n1:10:05.200 --> 1:10:08.520\n or like how good are the business people running\n\n1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:11.280\n the selling of drugs that are illegal?\n\n1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:13.440\n Are they all the same kind of rules apply\n\n1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:15.820\n from a behavioral economics perspective?\n\n1:10:15.820 --> 1:10:16.660\n I think so.\n\n1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:18.900\n I mean, they're basically, whether they're crunching\n\n1:10:18.900 --> 1:10:21.120\n the numbers or not, they're basically sensitive\n\n1:10:21.120 --> 1:10:24.480\n to that demand curve and they're doing the same thing\n\n1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:27.120\n that businesses do in a legal market.\n\n1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:30.640\n And, you know, you want to sell as much of a product\n\n1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:32.420\n to get as much money.\n\n1:10:32.420 --> 1:10:33.840\n You're looking more at the total income.\n\n1:10:33.840 --> 1:10:36.480\n So if you jack the price a little bit,\n\n1:10:36.480 --> 1:10:38.840\n you're going to get some reduction in consumption,\n\n1:10:38.840 --> 1:10:40.800\n but it may be that the total amount of money\n\n1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:44.400\n that you rake in is going to be more than,\n\n1:10:44.400 --> 1:10:46.360\n it's going to overcompensate for that.\n\n1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:47.240\n So you're willing to take,\n\n1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.220\n okay, I'm going to lose 10% of my customers,\n\n1:10:49.220 --> 1:10:52.600\n but I'm getting more than enough to compensate\n\n1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:53.920\n from that, from the extra money\n\n1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:55.740\n from the people who still are buying.\n\n1:10:55.740 --> 1:10:57.080\n So I think they're more, you know,\n\n1:10:57.080 --> 1:10:58.440\n and especially when we get to the lower,\n\n1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.520\n I wouldn't be surprised if people are crunching those numbers\n\n1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:03.960\n and looking at demand curves, maybe at the, you know,\n\n1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.040\n at the really high levels of the, you know,\n\n1:11:06.040 --> 1:11:07.920\n up the chain with the cartels and whatnot.\n\n1:11:07.920 --> 1:11:10.300\n I don't know, that wouldn't surprise me at all,\n\n1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:12.440\n but I think it's probably more implicit\n\n1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:16.280\n at the lower levels where something,\n\n1:11:16.280 --> 1:11:17.240\n you brought up drug policy.\n\n1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:19.760\n I will say that for years now,\n\n1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:24.760\n it's been this kind of unquestioned goal by, for example,\n\n1:11:25.220 --> 1:11:28.760\n the drug czar's office in the US\n\n1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:32.640\n to make the price of illegal drugs as high as possible\n\n1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:35.380\n without this kind of nuanced approach that,\n\n1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:38.680\n yeah, if you make, you know,\n\n1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:41.760\n for some people, if you make the price so high,\n\n1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:43.840\n you're actually making things worse.\n\n1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:47.520\n I mean, I'm all about reducing the problems associated\n\n1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:48.740\n with drugs and drug addictions.\n\n1:11:48.740 --> 1:11:50.480\n And part of that is the,\n\n1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:53.460\n are more direct consequences of those drugs themselves,\n\n1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:57.560\n but a whole lot is what you get from indirectly\n\n1:11:57.560 --> 1:11:59.720\n and, you know, sort of the,\n\n1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:02.080\n both for the individual and for society.\n\n1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:04.420\n So like making a poor person\n\n1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:05.860\n who doesn't have enough money for their kids,\n\n1:12:05.860 --> 1:12:06.920\n making them even poorer.\n\n1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:10.920\n So now you've made their children's future worse\n\n1:12:10.920 --> 1:12:12.560\n because they're growing up in deeper poverty\n\n1:12:12.560 --> 1:12:14.960\n because you've essentially levied a tax\n\n1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:18.760\n onto this person who's heavily addicted.\n\n1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:21.480\n But then at the societal level, you know,\n\n1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:23.480\n so everything we know about the drug war\n\n1:12:23.480 --> 1:12:26.200\n in terms of the heavy criminalization\n\n1:12:26.200 --> 1:12:29.280\n and filling up prisons and reducing employment\n\n1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:31.520\n and educational opportunities,\n\n1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:32.720\n which in the big picture,\n\n1:12:32.720 --> 1:12:35.840\n we know are the things that in a free market\n\n1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:38.920\n compete against some of the worst problems of addiction\n\n1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:40.880\n is actually having educational\n\n1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:42.120\n and employment opportunities.\n\n1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:44.560\n But when you give someone a felony, for example,\n\n1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:47.360\n you're pretty much guaranteeing\n\n1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:50.320\n they're never gonna go very high on the economic ladder.\n\n1:12:50.320 --> 1:12:53.800\n And so you're making drugs a better reward\n\n1:12:53.800 --> 1:12:56.360\n for that person's future.\n\n1:12:56.360 --> 1:13:00.480\n So this is a quick step into the policy realm.\n\n1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:02.800\n And I think for both you and I,\n\n1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.120\n I'm not sure you can correct me,\n\n1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:08.640\n but I'm more comfortable into studying the effects of drugs\n\n1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:12.140\n on the human behavior and human psychology\n\n1:13:12.140 --> 1:13:13.160\n versus like policy.\n\n1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:14.800\n It seems like a whole giant mess,\n\n1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:19.800\n but yeah, there's some libertarian candidates for president\n\n1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:23.160\n and just libertarian thinkers\n\n1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.180\n that had a nice thought experiment\n\n1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.720\n of possibly legalizing,\n\n1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.920\n I've spoken about possibly legalizing basically all drugs.\n\n1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:34.880\n In your intuition,\n\n1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:39.720\n do you think a world where all drugs are legal\n\n1:13:39.720 --> 1:13:43.680\n is a safer world or a less safe world\n\n1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:45.280\n for the users of those drugs?\n\n1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:47.880\n It really depends on what we mean by legalization.\n\n1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:50.440\n So this is one of my beefs with this,\n\n1:13:50.440 --> 1:13:52.280\n how these things are talked about.\n\n1:13:52.280 --> 1:13:57.280\n I mean, we have very few completely laissez faire,\n\n1:13:57.400 --> 1:13:59.400\n you know, legal drugs.\n\n1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:02.360\n So even caffeine is one of the few examples.\n\n1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:05.720\n So for example, caffeine and tea and coffee is in that realm.\n\n1:14:05.720 --> 1:14:07.420\n Like there's no limits, no one's testing,\n\n1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:09.320\n there's no laws, regulation at any level\n\n1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:11.200\n of how much caffeine you're allowed to buy\n\n1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:12.040\n or how much is in the product.\n\n1:14:12.040 --> 1:14:14.960\n But even like with this Starbucks, like nitro,\n\n1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:18.000\n there are rules with soda and with canned products,\n\n1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:19.440\n you can only put so much.\n\n1:14:19.440 --> 1:14:20.280\n In there, yeah.\n\n1:14:20.280 --> 1:14:22.800\n So this is FDA regulated.\n\n1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:24.880\n And it's kind of weird because there's a limit to sodas\n\n1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:27.400\n that's not there for energy drinks and other things.\n\n1:14:27.400 --> 1:14:29.520\n But, you know, so even caffeine,\n\n1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:31.480\n it depends on what product we're talking about.\n\n1:14:31.480 --> 1:14:33.000\n Like if you're like no dose\n\n1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:34.840\n and other caffeine products over the counter,\n\n1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:36.920\n like you can't just put 800 milligrams in there.\n\n1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:39.400\n The pills are like one or 200 milligrams.\n\n1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:41.920\n And so it's FDA regulated as an over counter drug.\n\n1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:45.200\n Some of the most dangerous drugs in society,\n\n1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:47.280\n I would say arguably one of the most dangerous classes\n\n1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:49.600\n of drugs is the volatile anesthetics, huffing.\n\n1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:52.120\n People huffing gasoline and, you know, airplane glue,\n\n1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:57.120\n toluene, whatnot, severely damaging to the nervous system.\n\n1:14:58.480 --> 1:15:01.480\n Pretty much legal, but there's some regulation\n\n1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:03.000\n in the sense that there's a warning label,\n\n1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.840\n like it's illegal to do it for,\n\n1:15:04.840 --> 1:15:07.880\n not that they're busting people for this,\n\n1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:10.520\n but, you know, it's against federal law\n\n1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:13.640\n to use this in a way other than intended type of,\n\n1:15:13.640 --> 1:15:17.080\n basically saying like, yeah, don't huff this, you know,\n\n1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.000\n your paint thinner or whatnot.\n\n1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:22.160\n It at least keeps people from selling it for that.\n\n1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:24.520\n Like, no, because they're gonna go after that person.\n\n1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:25.480\n They're not gonna be able to find\n\n1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:27.120\n the 12 year old who's huffing.\n\n1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:30.920\n So anyway, just as some extreme examples at the end.\n\n1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:34.960\n And then, you know, even the so called illegal,\n\n1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.440\n like schedule one drugs, psilocybin,\n\n1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:39.440\n we do plenty in terms of schedule two,\n\n1:15:39.440 --> 1:15:42.000\n which is ironically less restrictive than psilocybin,\n\n1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:43.360\n but methamphetamine and cocaine,\n\n1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:45.240\n I've done human research with.\n\n1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.000\n My research has been legal.\n\n1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.240\n So they're scheduled compounds,\n\n1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:49.520\n but they're not completely illegal.\n\n1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:51.520\n Like you can do research with them\n\n1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:55.600\n with the appropriate licenses and approval.\n\n1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:57.840\n So there really is no such thing.\n\n1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.040\n And like alcohol, well, it's illegal\n\n1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:03.520\n if you're 12 years old or 18 years old or 20 years old.\n\n1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:05.840\n And for anyone, it's illegal to be drinking it\n\n1:16:05.840 --> 1:16:06.680\n while you're driving.\n\n1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:09.080\n So there's always a nuance.\n\n1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:11.160\n It's not dichotomy.\n\n1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:12.480\n And I actually should admit,\n\n1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:13.960\n it's been on my to do list for a while\n\n1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:17.360\n to buy in Massachusetts, some like edible,\n\n1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:18.920\n or buy weed legally.\n\n1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:23.640\n Yeah, haven't done that in Massachusetts,\n\n1:16:23.640 --> 1:16:24.680\n let's put it this way.\n\n1:16:24.680 --> 1:16:28.280\n And I wonder what that experience is like,\n\n1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:31.040\n because I think it's fully legal in Massachusetts.\n\n1:16:31.040 --> 1:16:35.560\n And so I wonder what legal drugs look like to me.\n\n1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:38.920\n You know, I grew up with even weed being like,\n\n1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:41.840\n you know, it's like this forbidden thing,\n\n1:16:41.840 --> 1:16:43.840\n you know, not forbidden, but it's illegal.\n\n1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.480\n You know, most people, of course, I never partook,\n\n1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:50.520\n but most people I knew would attain it illegally.\n\n1:16:50.520 --> 1:16:53.760\n And so that big switch that's been happening\n\n1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:57.640\n across the country, there's like federal stuff going on\n\n1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:00.280\n to make marijuana legal federally.\n\n1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:01.560\n I'm half paying attention.\n\n1:17:01.560 --> 1:17:02.680\n There's some movement there.\n\n1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:03.760\n I mean, the House passed a bill\n\n1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:06.040\n that's not gonna be passed by the Senate,\n\n1:17:06.040 --> 1:17:08.520\n but yeah, it's progress.\n\n1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:09.960\n There's clearly a change.\n\n1:17:09.960 --> 1:17:11.400\n Right, it's moving in a trend.\n\n1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:14.440\n So that's the example of a drug that used to be illegal\n\n1:17:14.440 --> 1:17:16.800\n is now becoming more and more and more legal.\n\n1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:22.760\n So like, I wonder what like cocaine being legal looks like,\n\n1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:26.040\n what a society with cocaine being legal looks like,\n\n1:17:26.040 --> 1:17:30.760\n the rules around it, you know, the processes\n\n1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:34.440\n in which you can consume it in a safer way\n\n1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:37.080\n and be more educated about its consequences,\n\n1:17:37.080 --> 1:17:41.240\n be able to control dose and like purity much better,\n\n1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:44.080\n be able to get help for overdose.\n\n1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:46.800\n I don't know, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:17:46.800 --> 1:17:51.800\n It does in a utopian sense feel like legalizing drugs\n\n1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:56.440\n at least should be talked about and considered\n\n1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:59.600\n versus keeping them in the dark.\n\n1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:00.440\n I agree.\n\n1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:04.160\n But yeah, so that in your sense,\n\n1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:10.240\n it's possible that in 50 years we legalize all drugs\n\n1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:13.120\n and it makes for a better world.\n\n1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:15.800\n The way I like to talk about it is that I would say\n\n1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:18.360\n that it's possible and it would probably be a good thing\n\n1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:20.960\n if we regulate all drugs.\n\n1:18:20.960 --> 1:18:23.920\n How would you regulate like cocaine, for example?\n\n1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:25.600\n Is there ideas there?\n\n1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:28.720\n So yeah, and you were already, you know, going, you know,\n\n1:18:28.720 --> 1:18:31.160\n where I was going with that kind of first I described\n\n1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:32.040\n how there's always a new ones.\n\n1:18:32.040 --> 1:18:34.120\n And even like the cannabis in Massachusetts,\n\n1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:35.040\n federally illegal.\n\n1:18:35.040 --> 1:18:38.320\n So for example, if I was like, and I, you know,\n\n1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:39.840\n colleagues that do cannabis research\n\n1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:41.200\n where they get people high in the lab,\n\n1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.680\n like you're a federal funded researcher with NIH funds,\n\n1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:46.080\n you can't get that stuff from the dispensary\n\n1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:48.200\n because you're breaking a federal law.\n\n1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:50.880\n Even though the feds don't have the resources to go after,\n\n1:18:50.880 --> 1:18:52.480\n they don't want the controversy at this point\n\n1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:53.800\n to go after the individual users\n\n1:18:53.800 --> 1:18:56.280\n or even the sellers in those legal states.\n\n1:18:56.280 --> 1:18:57.360\n So there's always this nuance,\n\n1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.560\n but it's about the right regulation.\n\n1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:03.040\n So I think we already know enough that, for example,\n\n1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:06.240\n like I think safe injection sites for hard drugs\n\n1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:07.080\n makes a lot of sense.\n\n1:19:07.080 --> 1:19:11.560\n Like I wouldn't want heroin and cocaine\n\n1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.080\n at the convenience stores.\n\n1:19:13.080 --> 1:19:15.280\n And I don't think, maybe there's some extreme libertarians\n\n1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:16.120\n that want that.\n\n1:19:16.120 --> 1:19:19.360\n I think even the folks that identify as libertarians,\n\n1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:21.680\n probably most of them don't, well, I don't know.\n\n1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:23.680\n Like not all of them want that, you know?\n\n1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:27.600\n I think, you know, that as a form of regulation,\n\n1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:29.560\n like, look, if you're using these hard drugs\n\n1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:33.000\n on a regular basis, you're putting yourself at risk\n\n1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.240\n for lethal overdose.\n\n1:19:34.240 --> 1:19:37.920\n You're putting yourself at risk for catching HIV\n\n1:19:37.920 --> 1:19:39.520\n and hepatitis.\n\n1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:43.560\n If you're gonna do it, if you're doing it anyway,\n\n1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:46.120\n come to this place where at least you're not like,\n\n1:19:46.120 --> 1:19:50.120\n you know, like pulling the water out of like,\n\n1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:52.320\n you know, the puddle on the side of the street.\n\n1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:54.120\n Yeah, so it's done by professionals\n\n1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:57.120\n and those professionals are able to educate you also.\n\n1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:01.680\n So like a 711 clerk may not be both capable\n\n1:20:01.680 --> 1:20:05.200\n of helping you to inject the drug properly,\n\n1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:07.680\n but also won't be equipped to educate you\n\n1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:10.040\n at the negative consequences, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:11.880\n That's a huge part of it, the education.\n\n1:20:11.880 --> 1:20:13.720\n But then I think with the opioids,\n\n1:20:13.720 --> 1:20:18.280\n like the big part of it is just like with naloxone,\n\n1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:21.960\n which is an antagonist, it goes into the receptor,\n\n1:20:21.960 --> 1:20:23.960\n it's called Narcan, that's the trade name,\n\n1:20:23.960 --> 1:20:26.960\n but it's what they revive people on an opioid overdose.\n\n1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:29.200\n That's almost completely effective.\n\n1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:31.120\n Like if there's a medical professional there\n\n1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:33.320\n and someone's ODing on an opioid,\n\n1:20:33.320 --> 1:20:35.360\n they're virtually guaranteed to live.\n\n1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:40.120\n Like that's remarkable that if 100% at the opioid crisis,\n\n1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:43.040\n you know, if all of those people right now that are dying\n\n1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:45.280\n were doing that in the presence of a medical professional,\n\n1:20:45.280 --> 1:20:48.040\n like even like a nurse with Narcan,\n\n1:20:48.040 --> 1:20:50.000\n there'd be basically almost no deaths.\n\n1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.400\n There's always some exceptions, but you know,\n\n1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:54.400\n almost no deaths, like that's staggering to me.\n\n1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:56.680\n So the idea that people are doing this,\n\n1:20:56.680 --> 1:21:01.160\n that we could have that level of positive effect\n\n1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:02.560\n without encouraging the drug.\n\n1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:05.040\n And this is where like you get into this like terrain\n\n1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:06.520\n of like sending the wrong message.\n\n1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:09.040\n And it's like, no, you can do that.\n\n1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:12.080\n You can say like, we're not encouraging this.\n\n1:21:12.080 --> 1:21:15.360\n In fact, probably one of the greatest advertisements\n\n1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:16.880\n for not getting hooked on heroin\n\n1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:18.360\n is like visiting a methadone clinic,\n\n1:21:18.360 --> 1:21:19.880\n visiting a safe injection site.\n\n1:21:19.880 --> 1:21:23.640\n Like this is not like an advertisement\n\n1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.040\n for getting hooked on this drug,\n\n1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:26.640\n but knowing that we can save people.\n\n1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:27.880\n Now you have a landscape here\n\n1:21:27.880 --> 1:21:31.080\n because a lot of times it's just like supervised injection,\n\n1:21:31.080 --> 1:21:32.640\n but you bring your own stuff, you know,\n\n1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:34.880\n you bring your own heroin, which could still be, you know,\n\n1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:38.760\n dirty and filled with fentanyl and fentanyl derivatives,\n\n1:21:38.760 --> 1:21:41.480\n which because of the incredible potency\n\n1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:43.400\n and the more difficulty measuring it,\n\n1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:46.040\n and some differences at the receptor,\n\n1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:47.680\n like you may be more likely,\n\n1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:51.280\n you are more likely on average to lethally overdose on it.\n\n1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.760\n You know, so you could,\n\n1:21:53.760 --> 1:21:55.880\n the level that's been more explored in Switzerland\n\n1:21:55.880 --> 1:22:00.880\n is in some places is you actually provide the drug itself\n\n1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:03.160\n and you supervise the injection.\n\n1:22:03.160 --> 1:22:04.000\n So I don't see.\n\n1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.120\n Do you like that idea?\n\n1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:08.720\n Yeah, the public health data are completely on the side of,\n\n1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:11.000\n there's really no credible evidence to this.\n\n1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.720\n If we allow that, we're sending the wrong message\n\n1:22:12.720 --> 1:22:15.560\n and everyone's gonna, I mean, I'm not showing up.\n\n1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:17.320\n Like, you know, and it's different by drug.\n\n1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:19.880\n Like, yeah, you legalize, you set up cannabis shops\n\n1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:20.720\n and some people are gonna say,\n\n1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:21.880\n so you go, I'm gonna go there.\n\n1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:22.960\n I don't think a whole lot of people\n\n1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:24.840\n are gonna go to one of these places\n\n1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:28.040\n and say, I'm gonna shoot up heroin for the first time.\n\n1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:29.320\n And even if like, you know,\n\n1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:30.840\n it's a country of 300 million people,\n\n1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:33.200\n like even if someone does that,\n\n1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:35.800\n you have to compare this to the every day\n\n1:22:35.800 --> 1:22:39.160\n people are dying from opioid overdoses.\n\n1:22:39.160 --> 1:22:41.240\n Like people's kids, people's uncles,\n\n1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:42.800\n people's like, these are real lives\n\n1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:43.640\n that are being shattered.\n\n1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.360\n So you just look at that.\n\n1:22:45.360 --> 1:22:46.200\n And then the other thing,\n\n1:22:46.200 --> 1:22:49.080\n and I know this from having done residential,\n\n1:22:49.080 --> 1:22:50.480\n even like non treatment research,\n\n1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:52.880\n where we just have a cocaine user or something,\n\n1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:54.600\n stay on our inpatient ward for a month\n\n1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:55.600\n and you really get to know them.\n\n1:22:55.600 --> 1:22:58.080\n And sometimes you see like, oftentimes\n\n1:22:58.080 --> 1:23:00.760\n that's the first time this person has had a discussion\n\n1:23:00.760 --> 1:23:03.000\n with a medical professional, any type of professional\n\n1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.280\n in their entire life around their drug use.\n\n1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:07.240\n Even if they're not looking to quit.\n\n1:23:07.240 --> 1:23:09.400\n And it's like, you know, you could imagine that\n\n1:23:09.400 --> 1:23:12.600\n in the safe injection settings where it's like,\n\n1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:15.200\n it might be a year into treatment and they're like,\n\n1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:17.440\n you know, doc, I know you're not the cops.\n\n1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:18.520\n Like you really care for me.\n\n1:23:18.520 --> 1:23:21.160\n Like, I think I'm ready to try that methadone thing.\n\n1:23:21.160 --> 1:23:23.520\n I think I'm really, I think I wanna be done.\n\n1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:24.720\n I'm really patient about it, yeah.\n\n1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:26.680\n Yeah, they get to trust the people\n\n1:23:26.680 --> 1:23:29.000\n and realize that they're there\n\n1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.040\n cause they truly like, they have a compassion,\n\n1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:34.460\n a love for this community, like as human beings,\n\n1:23:34.460 --> 1:23:36.480\n and they don't want people to die.\n\n1:23:36.480 --> 1:23:39.280\n And you get real human connections and that,\n\n1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:40.940\n and again, like those are the conditions\n\n1:23:40.940 --> 1:23:42.960\n where people are gonna ultimately seek treatment\n\n1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:46.800\n and not everyone always will, but you're gonna get that.\n\n1:23:46.800 --> 1:23:48.400\n And then, you know, you're gonna get people\n\n1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:50.960\n like looking into treatment options sometimes,\n\n1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:53.720\n you know, maybe it's years into the treatment.\n\n1:23:53.720 --> 1:23:56.120\n So it's like, they're just all of these indirect benefits\n\n1:23:56.120 --> 1:23:57.680\n that I think at that level,\n\n1:23:57.680 --> 1:23:59.440\n I don't know if you'd call that legalizing,\n\n1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:02.720\n you know, I think again, at least well regulated.\n\n1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:04.600\n Right, whatever that word is.\n\n1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:08.280\n Yeah, well regulated, but out in the open.\n\n1:24:08.280 --> 1:24:11.520\n Right, minimizing as many harms as we can\n\n1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:13.360\n while not encouraging.\n\n1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:15.480\n I mean, we don't encourage people to drink all the,\n\n1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:17.880\n I mean, people die every year from caffeine overdose.\n\n1:24:17.880 --> 1:24:20.580\n Like, you know, there's different ways to like, you know,\n\n1:24:20.580 --> 1:24:22.320\n just by allowing something doesn't mean\n\n1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:24.440\n we're sending the message that, you know,\n\n1:24:24.440 --> 1:24:26.960\n by saying we're not gonna give you a felony,\n\n1:24:26.960 --> 1:24:31.960\n which is actually often the penalty for psychedelics.\n\n1:24:32.120 --> 1:24:34.880\n I just actually testified for the Judiciary Committee\n\n1:24:34.880 --> 1:24:38.440\n of the Senate, the Assembly in New Jersey.\n\n1:24:38.440 --> 1:24:43.440\n And just to move psilocybin from a felony to misdemeanor,\n\n1:24:43.800 --> 1:24:45.480\n they use different language in New Jersey, it's weird,\n\n1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:47.160\n but like the equivalent of felony and misdemeanor.\n\n1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:49.560\n And that was like, two people didn't vote for that\n\n1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:53.220\n on this committee because it was might,\n\n1:24:53.220 --> 1:24:55.160\n one of them said it might be sending the wrong message.\n\n1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:59.080\n And it's like, a felony, I mean, there's real harms.\n\n1:24:59.080 --> 1:25:01.560\n Like, that's the scarlet letter the rest of your life.\n\n1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:04.200\n You're stuck at the lower ends of the employment ladder.\n\n1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:07.000\n You're not gonna get, you know, loans for education,\n\n1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:08.960\n all of this, maybe because of a stupid mistake\n\n1:25:08.960 --> 1:25:11.400\n you made once as a 19 year old.\n\n1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:12.800\n Doing something that like, you know,\n\n1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:15.260\n a presidential candidate could have done and admitted to\n\n1:25:15.260 --> 1:25:16.840\n and had no problem, you know?\n\n1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:21.840\n Yeah, what drug is the most addictive,\n\n1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:25.480\n the most dangerous in your view?\n\n1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:29.040\n Not maybe, like not technically,\n\n1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:31.320\n like specifically which drug,\n\n1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:34.240\n but more like in our society today,\n\n1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:35.960\n what is a highly problematic drug?\n\n1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:38.840\n We talked about psychedelics not being that addictive\n\n1:25:40.120 --> 1:25:41.720\n on the other flip side of that.\n\n1:25:41.720 --> 1:25:45.360\n You mentioned cocaine, is that the top one?\n\n1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:46.200\n Is there something else?\n\n1:25:46.200 --> 1:25:48.000\n That's a concern to you?\n\n1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.240\n It depends, and you've already alluded to this nuance.\n\n1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:51.360\n It depends on how you define it.\n\n1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:53.760\n If we're talking about on the ground today,\n\n1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:56.320\n in, you know, a modern society,\n\n1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:59.800\n I'd say nicotine, tobacco.\n\n1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:00.960\n Oh shit.\n\n1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:03.480\n I mean, in terms of mortality,\n\n1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:08.480\n it kills far more than any other drug known to humankind.\n\n1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:10.960\n Four times more than alcohol,\n\n1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:13.680\n like a half million deaths in the US every year\n\n1:26:13.680 --> 1:26:18.520\n and about five to six million worldwide due to tobacco.\n\n1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.560\n That's four times more in the US than alcohol.\n\n1:26:21.560 --> 1:26:25.080\n And if you graph all of the drugs, legal and illegal,\n\n1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:28.040\n like, you know, put all of the illegal drugs\n\n1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:30.760\n in like one category on that figure,\n\n1:26:30.760 --> 1:26:33.480\n and you put alcohol and tobacco on that figure,\n\n1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:35.160\n all the illegal drugs combined,\n\n1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:39.800\n they're a barely visible blip to this incredible,\n\n1:26:39.800 --> 1:26:43.280\n like there's no, even all of the opioid epidemic rolled up\n\n1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:44.800\n along with cocaine and everything else,\n\n1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:47.080\n the meth barely shows up compared to tobacco.\n\n1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:49.360\n That's one of those uncomfortable truths\n\n1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:52.800\n that I don't know what to do with.\n\n1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:55.240\n It's like where everybody's freaking out\n\n1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:57.120\n about coronavirus, right?\n\n1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:00.720\n And nobody's... The relative.\n\n1:27:00.720 --> 1:27:01.560\n It's all relative.\n\n1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:03.760\n If you look at the relative thing,\n\n1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:06.240\n it's like, well, why aren't we freaking out\n\n1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:10.040\n about cigarettes, which we are increasingly so\n\n1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:12.400\n over the, historically speaking, right?\n\n1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:14.920\n Right. It's like terrorism versus swimming pools.\n\n1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:17.440\n I remember that being back in the,\n\n1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:18.880\n after the war on terror started.\n\n1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:21.720\n It's like, yeah, there's not even comparison.\n\n1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:25.320\n Okay. So, you know, that's a little sobering truth there.\n\n1:27:25.320 --> 1:27:26.880\n Cause I was thinking like cocaine,\n\n1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:29.800\n I was thinking about all of these hard drugs,\n\n1:27:29.800 --> 1:27:33.320\n but the reality is relatively nicotine is the big one.\n\n1:27:33.320 --> 1:27:35.440\n And you didn't ask about mortality or deaths.\n\n1:27:35.440 --> 1:27:37.400\n You asked about addiction,\n\n1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:40.480\n but that really is hard to evaluate.\n\n1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.560\n It gets into those nuances I spoke of before\n\n1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:45.080\n about there's not a unidimensional way\n\n1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:46.240\n to measure reinforcement.\n\n1:27:46.240 --> 1:27:48.000\n It kind of depends on the situation\n\n1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.760\n and what measure we're looking at.\n\n1:27:50.760 --> 1:27:55.000\n But you know, more people have access to tobacco\n\n1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:58.560\n and I'm not advocating that we make it an illegal drug.\n\n1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:00.880\n I think that would be a horrible mistake.\n\n1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:03.040\n Although there is a very credible push\n\n1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:07.600\n to mandate the reduction of nicotine in cigarettes,\n\n1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:10.840\n which I have most scientists that study it are for it.\n\n1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:14.040\n I think there's some real dangers there\n\n1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.120\n cause I see that in the broader history of drug use.\n\n1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:20.240\n It's like when has drug prohibition worked broadly speaking?\n\n1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:25.240\n And it's to me that path would only make sense\n\n1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:28.360\n in very good conjunction with eCigarettes,\n\n1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:31.560\n which once they're fully regulated can be a safer,\n\n1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:34.240\n not safe, but much safer alternative.\n\n1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:37.880\n And if we tax the hell out of eCigarettes\n\n1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:39.680\n and ban every attractive feature\n\n1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:41.800\n like flavors and everything,\n\n1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:45.960\n then that's gonna push people to a black market\n\n1:28:45.960 --> 1:28:47.760\n if they can't get the real thing from real cigarette.\n\n1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:49.840\n Like some people will just quit straight out.\n\n1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:51.360\n But I think with the regulators\n\n1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:53.920\n and what a lot of scientists that study tobacco,\n\n1:28:53.920 --> 1:28:56.900\n like myself, it's a big part still of what I study.\n\n1:28:58.640 --> 1:29:01.920\n They're not used to thinking about the like tobacco really\n\n1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:04.520\n as a drug largely speaking in terms of,\n\n1:29:05.560 --> 1:29:07.500\n for example, the history of prohibition.\n\n1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:08.340\n And I think of like,\n\n1:29:08.340 --> 1:29:09.960\n we already know there's an illicit market,\n\n1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:14.640\n a black market for tobacco to get around taxes.\n\n1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.600\n I mean, and for selling even loose cigarettes,\n\n1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:18.480\n that's what initially caused in Staten Island\n\n1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:20.840\n the police to approach Eric Garland\n\n1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:23.460\n who was selling loose cigarettes and he got choked out.\n\n1:29:23.460 --> 1:29:25.160\n I mean, the thing that caused that police contact\n\n1:29:25.160 --> 1:29:27.880\n was he was selling, well, I think reported\n\n1:29:27.880 --> 1:29:30.520\n to sell individual cigarettes for like,\n\n1:29:30.520 --> 1:29:32.240\n he gets home for court, it happens in Baltimore.\n\n1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:34.400\n And it's like, that's technically illegal.\n\n1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:39.160\n But are you not gonna have massive boats\n\n1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:42.240\n of supplies coming over from China and elsewhere\n\n1:29:42.240 --> 1:29:47.240\n of real deal cigarettes if you ban the sale of nicotine?\n\n1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:49.960\n Like it's obviously gonna happen.\n\n1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:52.520\n And you have to weigh that against,\n\n1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:55.640\n you're gonna create a black market to one size or another.\n\n1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.560\n And your intuition that really hasn't worked\n\n1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:59.860\n throughout the history when we've tried it.\n\n1:29:59.860 --> 1:30:01.920\n Right, but I see a potential path forward,\n\n1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:04.040\n but only if it's well,\n\n1:30:04.040 --> 1:30:06.080\n if it's not in conjunction with eCigarettes.\n\n1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:07.360\n If there's a clear alternative,\n\n1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:08.600\n that's a positive alternative\n\n1:30:08.600 --> 1:30:13.600\n that it kind of stares the population towards an alternative.\n\n1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:16.640\n The difference here, the unique thing\n\n1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:18.080\n that could be taken advantage of here\n\n1:30:18.080 --> 1:30:20.800\n is nicotine is by and large, not what causes the harm.\n\n1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:23.040\n It's the aromatic hydrocarbons,\n\n1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:26.360\n it's the carcinogens and tobacco,\n\n1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:29.500\n it's burning tobacco smoke, it's not the nicotine.\n\n1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:34.140\n So it's not like alcohol prohibition\n\n1:30:34.140 --> 1:30:37.680\n where like you couldn't create the O'Douls,\n\n1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:39.760\n the near beer is not gonna have the alcohol.\n\n1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:42.600\n And so people like, here you do have the possibility\n\n1:30:42.600 --> 1:30:47.600\n of giving another medium the ability to deliver the drug,\n\n1:30:48.080 --> 1:30:49.880\n which still aren't to a lot of people\n\n1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:52.320\n isn't preferred to the tobacco, but nonetheless,\n\n1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:54.220\n again, if you overregulate those\n\n1:30:54.220 --> 1:30:55.440\n and make them less attractive,\n\n1:30:55.440 --> 1:30:58.800\n like if you aren't thoughtful about the nicotine limits\n\n1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:00.880\n and thoughtful about whether you're allowing flavors\n\n1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:03.480\n and everything, and if you overtax them,\n\n1:31:03.480 --> 1:31:06.020\n you're actually decreasing the ability to compete\n\n1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:08.720\n with the more dangerous products.\n\n1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.120\n So I feel like there is a potential path forward,\n\n1:31:11.120 --> 1:31:12.480\n but I don't have a lot of confidence\n\n1:31:12.480 --> 1:31:17.080\n that that's gonna be done in a thoughtful analytical way.\n\n1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:20.760\n And I'm afraid that it could decrease the increase\n\n1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:23.160\n of black market calls all of the harms.\n\n1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:26.840\n Like every other drug we're moving away from the prohibition\n\n1:31:26.840 --> 1:31:30.120\n model slowly, but the big barge ship\n\n1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:32.400\n is like making a very slow turn.\n\n1:31:32.400 --> 1:31:34.960\n And like, okay, we really had to step back\n\n1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:38.760\n and question if we went with nicotine, tobacco,\n\n1:31:38.760 --> 1:31:41.560\n are we moving into that direction?\n\n1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:43.600\n Like big picture.\n\n1:31:43.600 --> 1:31:45.200\n It doesn't quite make sense.\n\n1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:50.200\n You've done a study on cocaine and sexual decision making.\n\n1:31:52.720 --> 1:31:53.900\n Can you explain?\n\n1:31:53.900 --> 1:31:56.920\n Can you explain the findings?\n\n1:31:56.920 --> 1:32:01.920\n I mean, in a broad sense, how do you do a study\n\n1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:08.140\n that involves cocaine and the other,\n\n1:32:08.300 --> 1:32:13.060\n how do you do a study involving sexual decision making?\n\n1:32:13.060 --> 1:32:16.700\n And then how do you do a study that combines both?\n\n1:32:16.700 --> 1:32:18.020\n Yeah, sex and drugs too.\n\n1:32:18.020 --> 1:32:19.460\n I'm just missing the rock and roll.\n\n1:32:19.460 --> 1:32:21.380\n It's like the two controversial,\n\n1:32:21.380 --> 1:32:23.760\n rock and roll isn't very controversial anymore.\n\n1:32:23.760 --> 1:32:26.380\n Yeah, so the cocaine, lots of hoops to jump through.\n\n1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:28.420\n You gotta have a lot of medical support.\n\n1:32:28.420 --> 1:32:30.620\n You gotta be at a basically an institution,\n\n1:32:30.620 --> 1:32:34.380\n a research unit like I'm at that has a long history\n\n1:32:34.380 --> 1:32:39.380\n and the ability to do that and get ethics approval,\n\n1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:41.620\n get FDA approval, but it's possible.\n\n1:32:41.620 --> 1:32:43.940\n And whenever you're dealing with something like cocaine,\n\n1:32:43.940 --> 1:32:46.820\n you would never wanna give that to someone\n\n1:32:46.820 --> 1:32:49.300\n who hasn't already used cocaine.\n\n1:32:49.300 --> 1:32:51.260\n And you wanna make sure you're not giving it to someone\n\n1:32:51.260 --> 1:32:53.380\n who is an active user who wants to quit.\n\n1:32:53.380 --> 1:32:54.780\n So the idea is like, okay,\n\n1:32:54.780 --> 1:32:57.180\n if you're using this type of drug anyway,\n\n1:32:57.180 --> 1:33:00.540\n and we're really sure you're not looking to quit,\n\n1:33:00.540 --> 1:33:04.220\n hey, use a couple of times in the lab with us\n\n1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:06.460\n so we can at least learn something.\n\n1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:09.100\n And part of what we learn is maybe to help people not use\n\n1:33:09.100 --> 1:33:12.060\n and it'll reduce the harms of cocaine.\n\n1:33:12.060 --> 1:33:14.340\n So there's hoops to jump through.\n\n1:33:14.340 --> 1:33:16.660\n With the sexual decision making,\n\n1:33:16.660 --> 1:33:18.980\n I looked at the main thing I looked at was this model\n\n1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:21.620\n of I applied delayed discounting\n\n1:33:21.620 --> 1:33:24.420\n to what we talked about earlier, the now versus later,\n\n1:33:24.420 --> 1:33:27.340\n that kind of decision making that goes along with addiction.\n\n1:33:27.340 --> 1:33:29.340\n I applied that to condom use decisions.\n\n1:33:30.220 --> 1:33:33.660\n And I've done probably published about 20 or so papers\n\n1:33:33.660 --> 1:33:35.140\n with this and different drugs.\n\n1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:39.140\n So the primary metric is whether you do\n\n1:33:39.140 --> 1:33:40.500\n or don't use a condom?\n\n1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:43.920\n Right, and so this is using hypothetical decision making,\n\n1:33:43.920 --> 1:33:47.700\n but I've published some studies looking at,\n\n1:33:47.700 --> 1:33:51.060\n showing a tight correspondence to self report it\n\n1:33:51.060 --> 1:33:54.740\n in correlational studies to self reported behavior.\n\n1:33:54.740 --> 1:33:57.940\n So this is like, so like how do you,\n\n1:33:57.940 --> 1:33:59.900\n did you do a questionnaire kind of thing?\n\n1:33:59.900 --> 1:34:02.360\n Right, so it's not quite a questionnaire,\n\n1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:07.360\n but it's a behavioral task requiring them to respond to.\n\n1:34:08.540 --> 1:34:11.580\n So you show pictures of a bunch of individuals\n\n1:34:11.580 --> 1:34:13.620\n and it's kind of like one of these fun behavioral,\n\n1:34:13.620 --> 1:34:15.820\n like a lot of them you get like numbers are boring,\n\n1:34:15.820 --> 1:34:17.420\n but it's like, okay, hot or not,\n\n1:34:17.420 --> 1:34:18.720\n like which of these 60 people\n\n1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:20.540\n would you have a one night stand with?\n\n1:34:20.540 --> 1:34:22.500\n Men, women, so pick whatever you like,\n\n1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:23.540\n a little bit of this, a little bit of that,\n\n1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:26.900\n whatever you're into, it's all variety there.\n\n1:34:26.900 --> 1:34:29.160\n Out of that group, you pick some subsets of people.\n\n1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:31.740\n Who do you think is the one you most want to have sex\n\n1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:34.060\n with the least, he thinks most likely to have an STI\n\n1:34:34.060 --> 1:34:37.820\n or least likely a sexually transmitted disease by STI.\n\n1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:41.540\n And then you could do certain decision making questions.\n\n1:34:41.540 --> 1:34:43.820\n So what I've done is asked,\n\n1:34:43.820 --> 1:34:45.220\n say this person you read a vignette,\n\n1:34:45.220 --> 1:34:46.860\n this person wants to have sex with you now you've met them,\n\n1:34:46.860 --> 1:34:50.020\n you get along casual sex scenario,\n\n1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:53.020\n like a one night stand with a condoms available,\n\n1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:54.820\n just rate your likelihood from one to 100\n\n1:34:54.820 --> 1:34:57.540\n on this kind of scale, would you use it?\n\n1:34:57.540 --> 1:34:59.820\n But then you can change your scenario to say,\n\n1:34:59.820 --> 1:35:01.700\n okay, now imagine you have to wait five minutes\n\n1:35:01.700 --> 1:35:02.940\n to use a condom.\n\n1:35:02.940 --> 1:35:04.940\n So the choice is now instead of using condom\n\n1:35:04.940 --> 1:35:07.380\n versus not in terms of your likelihood scale,\n\n1:35:07.380 --> 1:35:11.980\n it now what ranges from have sex now without a condom\n\n1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:13.820\n versus on the other end of the scale\n\n1:35:13.820 --> 1:35:16.380\n is wait five minutes to have sex with a condom.\n\n1:35:16.380 --> 1:35:18.380\n So you rate your likelihood of where your behavior\n\n1:35:18.380 --> 1:35:20.420\n would be along that continuum.\n\n1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:22.780\n And then you could say, okay, well, what about an hour?\n\n1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:23.900\n What about three hours?\n\n1:35:23.900 --> 1:35:25.980\n What about 24 hours?\n\n1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:30.980\n Misunderstanding, now without a condom\n\n1:35:31.100 --> 1:35:32.860\n or five minutes later with a condom?\n\n1:35:32.860 --> 1:35:33.700\n Right.\n\n1:35:33.700 --> 1:35:38.700\n So what's supposed to be the preference for the person?\n\n1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:44.060\n There's a lot of factors coming into play, right?\n\n1:35:44.060 --> 1:35:49.060\n There's like pleasure, a personal preference\n\n1:35:49.540 --> 1:35:51.540\n and then there's also the safety.\n\n1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:55.300\n Those are two like, are those competing objectives?\n\n1:35:55.300 --> 1:35:57.100\n Right, and so we do get at that\n\n1:35:57.100 --> 1:35:58.700\n through some individual measures\n\n1:35:58.700 --> 1:36:01.100\n and this task is more of a face valid task\n\n1:36:01.100 --> 1:36:02.620\n where there's a lot underneath the hood.\n\n1:36:02.620 --> 1:36:07.540\n So for most people, sex with the condom is the better reward\n\n1:36:07.540 --> 1:36:09.100\n but underneath the hood of that\n\n1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:11.460\n is just at the purely physical level,\n\n1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:13.580\n they'd rather have sex without the condom.\n\n1:36:13.580 --> 1:36:14.500\n It's gonna feel better.\n\n1:36:14.500 --> 1:36:15.660\n What do you mean by reward?\n\n1:36:15.660 --> 1:36:19.700\n Like when they calculate their trajectory through life\n\n1:36:19.700 --> 1:36:21.340\n and try to optimize it,\n\n1:36:21.340 --> 1:36:24.460\n then sex with the condom is a good idea?\n\n1:36:24.460 --> 1:36:27.820\n Well, it's really based on, I mean, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:30.660\n Presumably that's the case that there's,\n\n1:36:31.580 --> 1:36:33.140\n but it's measured by like what would you,\n\n1:36:33.140 --> 1:36:35.420\n really that first question where there is no delay.\n\n1:36:35.420 --> 1:36:38.020\n Most people say they would be at the higher end scale\n\n1:36:38.020 --> 1:36:39.380\n a lot of times 100% they would say\n\n1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:41.740\n they would definitely use a condom.\n\n1:36:41.740 --> 1:36:43.860\n Not everybody and that we know that's the case.\n\n1:36:43.860 --> 1:36:46.180\n See, it's like that some people don't like condoms,\n\n1:36:46.180 --> 1:36:49.100\n some people say, yeah, I wanna use a condom\n\n1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:50.980\n but quarter of the time ended up not\n\n1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:53.820\n because I just getting lost in the passion of the moment.\n\n1:36:53.820 --> 1:36:56.940\n So for the people, I mean, the only reason that people,\n\n1:36:56.940 --> 1:36:58.620\n so behaviorally speaking,\n\n1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:00.060\n at least for a large number of people\n\n1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:02.540\n in many circumstances condom use as a reinforcer\n\n1:37:02.540 --> 1:37:03.940\n just because people do it.\n\n1:37:03.940 --> 1:37:07.020\n Like, why are they doing it?\n\n1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:10.180\n They're not because it makes the sex feel better\n\n1:37:10.180 --> 1:37:12.660\n but because it makes that it allows\n\n1:37:12.660 --> 1:37:15.020\n for at least the same general reward.\n\n1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:16.940\n Even if actually, even if it feels a little bit\n\n1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:20.300\n not as good with the condom, nonetheless,\n\n1:37:20.300 --> 1:37:24.740\n they get most of the benefit without the concurrent,\n\n1:37:24.740 --> 1:37:27.940\n oh my gosh, there's this risk of either unwanted pregnancy\n\n1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:31.980\n or getting HIV or way more likely than HIV,\n\n1:37:31.980 --> 1:37:36.420\n herpes in general awards, et cetera, all the lovely ones.\n\n1:37:37.380 --> 1:37:38.900\n And we've actually done research saying like\n\n1:37:38.900 --> 1:37:40.340\n where we gauge the probability\n\n1:37:40.340 --> 1:37:42.580\n of these individual different SDIs.\n\n1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:43.660\n And it's like, what's the heavy hitter\n\n1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:46.580\n in terms of what people are using to judge\n\n1:37:46.580 --> 1:37:49.220\n and to evaluate whether they're gonna use a condom.\n\n1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:52.500\n So that's why the condom use is the delayed thing,\n\n1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:54.220\n five minutes or more.\n\n1:37:54.220 --> 1:37:56.340\n And then, yeah, because that's the prefer.\n\n1:37:56.340 --> 1:37:58.300\n Which would normally be the larger later reward\n\n1:37:58.300 --> 1:38:00.980\n like the $10 versus the nine, it's like the $10,\n\n1:38:00.980 --> 1:38:02.260\n which is counterintuitive\n\n1:38:02.260 --> 1:38:04.340\n if you just think about the physical pleasure.\n\n1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:07.180\n So that's a good thing to measure.\n\n1:38:07.180 --> 1:38:09.020\n So condom use is a really good concrete,\n\n1:38:09.020 --> 1:38:13.660\n quantifiable thing that you can use in a study.\n\n1:38:13.660 --> 1:38:15.980\n And then you can add a lot of different elements\n\n1:38:15.980 --> 1:38:18.380\n like the presence of cocaine and so on.\n\n1:38:18.380 --> 1:38:20.980\n Yeah, you can get people loaded on like any number of drugs\n\n1:38:20.980 --> 1:38:22.860\n like cocaine, alcohol and methamphetamine\n\n1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:24.980\n are the three that I've done and published on.\n\n1:38:24.980 --> 1:38:26.820\n And it's interesting that.\n\n1:38:26.820 --> 1:38:28.940\n These are fun studies, man.\n\n1:38:28.940 --> 1:38:32.260\n Right, I love to get people loaded in a safe context\n\n1:38:32.260 --> 1:38:34.100\n and like, but to really, it started,\n\n1:38:34.100 --> 1:38:36.380\n like there was some early research with alcohol.\n\n1:38:36.380 --> 1:38:38.060\n I mean, the psychedelics are the most interesting,\n\n1:38:38.060 --> 1:38:40.340\n but it's like all of these drugs are fascinating.\n\n1:38:40.340 --> 1:38:41.620\n The fact that all of these are keys\n\n1:38:41.620 --> 1:38:45.340\n that unlock a certain like psychological experience\n\n1:38:45.340 --> 1:38:46.580\n in the head.\n\n1:38:46.580 --> 1:38:48.580\n And so there was this work with alcohol\n\n1:38:48.580 --> 1:38:51.460\n that showed that it didn't affect those monetary\n\n1:38:51.460 --> 1:38:53.140\n delay discounting decisions,\n\n1:38:53.140 --> 1:38:54.940\n $9 now versus $10 later.\n\n1:38:54.940 --> 1:38:57.020\n And I'm like getting people drunk.\n\n1:38:57.020 --> 1:38:59.780\n And I thought to myself, are you telling me\n\n1:38:59.780 --> 1:39:02.420\n that getting someone,\n\n1:39:02.420 --> 1:39:05.420\n that people being drunk does not cause people\n\n1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:06.700\n at least sometimes to make,\n\n1:39:07.660 --> 1:39:10.780\n to choose what's good for them in the short term\n\n1:39:10.780 --> 1:39:13.740\n at the expense of what's good for them in the long term.\n\n1:39:13.740 --> 1:39:16.660\n It's like, bullshit, like we see like,\n\n1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.300\n but in what context does that happen?\n\n1:39:19.300 --> 1:39:21.980\n So that's something that inspired me to go\n\n1:39:21.980 --> 1:39:25.540\n in this direction of like, aha, risky sexual decisions\n\n1:39:25.540 --> 1:39:27.060\n is something they do when they're drunk.\n\n1:39:27.060 --> 1:39:28.220\n They don't necessarily go home.\n\n1:39:28.220 --> 1:39:30.540\n And even though some people have gambling problems\n\n1:39:30.540 --> 1:39:31.820\n and alcohol interacts with that,\n\n1:39:31.820 --> 1:39:34.740\n the most typical thing is not for people to go home,\n\n1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:36.940\n log on and change their allocation\n\n1:39:36.940 --> 1:39:40.460\n in their retirement account or something like that.\n\n1:39:40.460 --> 1:39:42.420\n But they're more likely, risky sexual decisions,\n\n1:39:42.420 --> 1:39:44.460\n they're more likely to not wait the five minutes\n\n1:39:44.460 --> 1:39:48.340\n for the condom and instead go no condom now.\n\n1:39:48.340 --> 1:39:49.580\n Right, that's a big effect.\n\n1:39:49.580 --> 1:39:50.660\n And we see that.\n\n1:39:50.660 --> 1:39:53.300\n And interestingly, we do not see,\n\n1:39:53.300 --> 1:39:55.180\n with those different drugs, we don't see an effect\n\n1:39:55.180 --> 1:39:57.260\n if we just look at that zero delay condition.\n\n1:39:57.260 --> 1:39:59.700\n In other words, the condoms right there waiting to be used,\n\n1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:00.700\n how likely are to use it?\n\n1:40:00.700 --> 1:40:01.700\n You don't see it.\n\n1:40:01.700 --> 1:40:05.700\n I mean, people are by and large gonna use the condom.\n\n1:40:05.700 --> 1:40:08.020\n So, and that's the way most of this research\n\n1:40:08.020 --> 1:40:09.460\n outside of behavioral economics\n\n1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:11.460\n that just looked at condom use decisions,\n\n1:40:12.740 --> 1:40:15.220\n very little of which has ever actually administered\n\n1:40:15.220 --> 1:40:17.420\n the drugs, which is another unique aspect.\n\n1:40:17.420 --> 1:40:19.420\n But they usually just look at like assuming\n\n1:40:19.420 --> 1:40:20.620\n the condom is there.\n\n1:40:20.620 --> 1:40:22.980\n But this is more using behavioral economics\n\n1:40:22.980 --> 1:40:24.620\n to delve in and model something that,\n\n1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:26.380\n and I've done survey research on this,\n\n1:40:26.380 --> 1:40:28.180\n modeling what actually happens.\n\n1:40:28.180 --> 1:40:30.740\n Like you meet someone at a laundromat,\n\n1:40:30.740 --> 1:40:32.300\n like you weren't planning on like,\n\n1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:34.740\n and it's like one thing leads to another,\n\n1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:37.940\n they live around the corner, these things.\n\n1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:42.940\n And like we did one survey with men who have sex with men\n\n1:40:43.260 --> 1:40:48.220\n and found that 25% of them, 24%, about a quarter,\n\n1:40:48.220 --> 1:40:49.780\n reported in the last six months\n\n1:40:49.780 --> 1:40:52.380\n that they had unprotected anal intercourse,\n\n1:40:52.380 --> 1:40:54.220\n which is the most risky\n\n1:40:54.220 --> 1:40:56.940\n in terms of sexually transmitted infection.\n\n1:40:58.460 --> 1:41:00.380\n In the last six months, in a situation\n\n1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:01.820\n where they would have used a condom,\n\n1:41:01.820 --> 1:41:02.860\n but they simply didn't use one\n\n1:41:02.860 --> 1:41:04.980\n just because they didn't have one on them.\n\n1:41:04.980 --> 1:41:07.500\n So this to me, it's like,\n\n1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:10.380\n if unless we delve into this and understand this,\n\n1:41:10.380 --> 1:41:12.420\n these suboptimal conditions,\n\n1:41:12.420 --> 1:41:14.140\n we're not gonna fully address the problem.\n\n1:41:14.140 --> 1:41:15.380\n There's plenty of people that say,\n\n1:41:15.380 --> 1:41:17.020\n yep, condom use is good.\n\n1:41:17.020 --> 1:41:19.180\n I use it a lot of the time.\n\n1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:21.340\n It's like, where is that failing?\n\n1:41:21.340 --> 1:41:22.940\n And it's under these suboptimal conditions,\n\n1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:24.420\n which in Frank, if you think about it,\n\n1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:26.460\n it's like most of the case.\n\n1:41:26.460 --> 1:41:28.860\n Action is unfolding, things are getting hot and heavy.\n\n1:41:28.860 --> 1:41:31.060\n Someone's like, do you got a condom?\n\n1:41:31.060 --> 1:41:32.020\n Eh, no.\n\n1:41:32.020 --> 1:41:34.460\n It's like, do they break the action\n\n1:41:34.460 --> 1:41:37.620\n and take 10 minutes to go to the convenience store\n\n1:41:37.620 --> 1:41:38.460\n or whatever?\n\n1:41:38.460 --> 1:41:39.580\n Maybe everything's closed.\n\n1:41:39.580 --> 1:41:41.340\n Maybe they gotta wait till tomorrow.\n\n1:41:42.860 --> 1:41:47.380\n And there's something to be studied there on the,\n\n1:41:47.380 --> 1:41:49.860\n that just seems like an unfortunate set of circumstances.\n\n1:41:49.860 --> 1:41:51.660\n Like, what's the solution to that is,\n\n1:41:53.260 --> 1:41:56.380\n I mean, what's the psychology\n\n1:41:56.380 --> 1:42:00.860\n that needs to be taken apart there?\n\n1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:02.860\n Because it just seems like that's the way of life.\n\n1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:05.020\n We don't expect the things to happen.\n\n1:42:05.020 --> 1:42:07.260\n Are we supposed to expect them better\n\n1:42:07.260 --> 1:42:11.580\n to be self aware enough about our calculations?\n\n1:42:11.580 --> 1:42:15.780\n Or you see the 10 minute detour to a convenience store\n\n1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:20.220\n as a kind of thing that we need to understand\n\n1:42:20.220 --> 1:42:25.220\n how we humans evaluate the cost of that.\n\n1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:30.340\n I think in terms of like how we use this to help people,\n\n1:42:30.340 --> 1:42:32.140\n it's mostly on the environment side,\n\n1:42:32.140 --> 1:42:34.500\n rather than on the individual side.\n\n1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:36.140\n Yeah, although those interact.\n\n1:42:36.140 --> 1:42:38.220\n So it's like, in one sense, if you're,\n\n1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:39.740\n especially if you're gonna be drinking\n\n1:42:39.740 --> 1:42:42.300\n or using another substance that is associated\n\n1:42:42.300 --> 1:42:45.380\n with a stimulant, alcohol and stimulants\n\n1:42:45.380 --> 1:42:47.220\n go along with risky sex.\n\n1:42:47.220 --> 1:42:49.260\n Good to be aware that you might make decisions\n\n1:42:49.260 --> 1:42:50.900\n just to tell yourself you might make a decision\n\n1:42:50.900 --> 1:42:54.060\n that you wouldn't have made in your sober state.\n\n1:42:54.060 --> 1:42:57.100\n And so, hey, throwing a condom in the purse,\n\n1:42:57.100 --> 1:43:00.860\n in the pocket, might be a good idea.\n\n1:43:00.860 --> 1:43:02.340\n I think at the environmental level,\n\n1:43:02.340 --> 1:43:04.620\n just more condom, I mean, it highlights what we know\n\n1:43:04.620 --> 1:43:07.780\n about just making condoms widely available.\n\n1:43:07.780 --> 1:43:09.500\n Something that I'd like to do\n\n1:43:09.500 --> 1:43:12.420\n is like reinforcing condom use.\n\n1:43:12.420 --> 1:43:17.420\n So just getting people used to carrying a condom\n\n1:43:17.420 --> 1:43:18.620\n everywhere they go.\n\n1:43:18.620 --> 1:43:20.900\n Because once it's in someone's habit,\n\n1:43:20.900 --> 1:43:22.780\n if they are, say, like a young, single person,\n\n1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:26.740\n and they occasionally have unprotected sex,\n\n1:43:26.740 --> 1:43:27.900\n like training those people,\n\n1:43:27.900 --> 1:43:30.300\n like what if you got a text message\n\n1:43:30.300 --> 1:43:31.700\n once every few days saying,\n\n1:43:31.700 --> 1:43:34.580\n ah, if you send back a photo of a condom,\n\n1:43:34.580 --> 1:43:37.580\n within a minute you get a reward of $5.\n\n1:43:37.580 --> 1:43:39.100\n You could shape that up like that.\n\n1:43:39.100 --> 1:43:40.860\n It's a process called contingency management.\n\n1:43:40.860 --> 1:43:43.820\n It's basically just straight up operant reinforcement.\n\n1:43:43.820 --> 1:43:45.820\n You could shape that up with no problem.\n\n1:43:45.820 --> 1:43:50.100\n And I mean, those procedures of contingency management,\n\n1:43:50.100 --> 1:43:52.220\n giving people systematic rewards is like,\n\n1:43:52.220 --> 1:43:53.420\n for example, the most powerful way\n\n1:43:53.420 --> 1:43:57.100\n to reduce cocaine use in addicted people.\n\n1:43:57.100 --> 1:44:02.100\n And by saying, if you show me a negative urine for cocaine,\n\n1:44:04.380 --> 1:44:05.860\n I'm gonna give you a monetary reward.\n\n1:44:05.860 --> 1:44:07.660\n And like that has huge effects\n\n1:44:07.660 --> 1:44:09.660\n in terms of decreasing cocaine use.\n\n1:44:09.660 --> 1:44:10.820\n If that can be that powerful\n\n1:44:10.820 --> 1:44:12.900\n for something like stopping cocaine use,\n\n1:44:12.900 --> 1:44:15.700\n how powerful could that be for shaping up\n\n1:44:15.700 --> 1:44:16.540\n just carrying a condom?\n\n1:44:16.540 --> 1:44:19.500\n Because the primary, unlike cocaine use,\n\n1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:22.820\n here, we're not saying you can't have the main reward,\n\n1:44:22.820 --> 1:44:24.780\n like you could still have sex,\n\n1:44:24.780 --> 1:44:26.060\n and you can even have sex in the way\n\n1:44:26.060 --> 1:44:28.580\n that you tell yourself you'd rather do it\n\n1:44:28.580 --> 1:44:30.300\n if the condom is available.\n\n1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:36.700\n Relatively speaking, it's way easier\n\n1:44:36.700 --> 1:44:39.580\n than like not using cocaine if you like using cocaine.\n\n1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:41.780\n It's just basically getting in the habit\n\n1:44:41.780 --> 1:44:43.140\n of carrying a condom.\n\n1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:45.020\n So that's just one idea of like why.\n\n1:44:45.020 --> 1:44:47.060\n There could be also the capitalistic solutions\n\n1:44:47.060 --> 1:44:49.300\n of like, there could be a business opportunity\n\n1:44:49.300 --> 1:44:51.700\n for like a door dash for condoms.\n\n1:44:51.700 --> 1:44:52.540\n Oh yeah.\n\n1:44:52.540 --> 1:44:53.860\n Like delivery.\n\n1:44:53.860 --> 1:44:55.060\n I thought about this.\n\n1:44:55.060 --> 1:44:57.980\n Within five minute delivery of a condom at any location,\n\n1:44:57.980 --> 1:44:59.460\n like Uber for condoms.\n\n1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:01.100\n I've thought about it, not with condoms,\n\n1:45:01.100 --> 1:45:03.140\n but a very similar line of thinking,\n\n1:45:03.140 --> 1:45:05.980\n a line that you're going into in terms of Uber\n\n1:45:05.980 --> 1:45:09.020\n and people getting drunk when they enter the bar\n\n1:45:09.020 --> 1:45:10.180\n playing to have one or two,\n\n1:45:10.180 --> 1:45:11.500\n they ended up having five or six,\n\n1:45:11.500 --> 1:45:14.740\n and it's like, okay, yeah, you can take the cab home,\n\n1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:17.140\n the Uber home, but you've left your car there.\n\n1:45:17.140 --> 1:45:18.460\n It might get towed.\n\n1:45:18.460 --> 1:45:20.780\n You might like, there's also the hassle of just,\n\n1:45:20.780 --> 1:45:22.380\n you wanna wake up tomorrow with your hangover\n\n1:45:22.380 --> 1:45:24.540\n and forget about it and move on.\n\n1:45:24.540 --> 1:45:26.260\n And I think a lot of people in their situation,\n\n1:45:26.260 --> 1:45:27.900\n they're like, screw it.\n\n1:45:27.900 --> 1:45:29.860\n I'm gonna take the risk, just get it.\n\n1:45:29.860 --> 1:45:32.060\n What if you had an Uber service where two,\n\n1:45:33.220 --> 1:45:38.220\n you have a car come out with two drivers\n\n1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:43.220\n and one of them, two sober drivers, obviously,\n\n1:45:45.100 --> 1:45:49.660\n and the person, the one driver drops off the other\n\n1:45:49.660 --> 1:45:54.660\n that then drives you home in their car, in your car,\n\n1:45:55.660 --> 1:45:57.140\n so that you can, I mean,\n\n1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:59.100\n I think a lot of people would pay 50 bucks.\n\n1:45:59.100 --> 1:46:01.180\n It's gonna be more than a regular Uber,\n\n1:46:01.180 --> 1:46:02.820\n but it's like, it's gonna be done.\n\n1:46:02.820 --> 1:46:03.660\n I got the money.\n\n1:46:03.660 --> 1:46:06.420\n I already spent 60 bucks at the bar tonight.\n\n1:46:06.420 --> 1:46:09.620\n Like, just get the damn thing done tomorrow.\n\n1:46:09.620 --> 1:46:10.660\n I'm done with it.\n\n1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:12.980\n I wake up, my car's in front of my house.\n\n1:46:12.980 --> 1:46:14.860\n I think that would be, I think someone could,\n\n1:46:14.860 --> 1:46:15.980\n I'm not gonna open that business,\n\n1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:19.060\n so if anyone hears this and wants to take off with that,\n\n1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:20.780\n I think it could help a lot of people.\n\n1:46:20.780 --> 1:46:21.620\n Yeah, definitely.\n\n1:46:21.620 --> 1:46:23.540\n And Uber itself, I would say,\n\n1:46:23.540 --> 1:46:25.460\n helped a huge amount of people,\n\n1:46:25.460 --> 1:46:28.460\n just making it easy to make the decision\n\n1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:31.580\n of going home, not driving yourself.\n\n1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:33.340\n I read about in Austin where they,\n\n1:46:33.340 --> 1:46:34.220\n I don't know where it's at now,\n\n1:46:34.220 --> 1:46:36.300\n where they outlawed Uber for a while.\n\n1:46:36.300 --> 1:46:39.100\n You know, because of the whole taxicab union type thing\n\n1:46:39.100 --> 1:46:42.060\n and how just, yeah, there were like hordes of drunk people\n\n1:46:42.060 --> 1:46:44.900\n that were used to Uber\n\n1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:47.340\n that now didn't have a cheap alternative.\n\n1:46:47.340 --> 1:46:51.860\n So just, we didn't exactly mention,\n\n1:46:51.860 --> 1:46:54.220\n you've done a lot of studies in sexual decision making\n\n1:46:54.220 --> 1:46:55.180\n with different drugs.\n\n1:46:55.180 --> 1:46:59.540\n Is there some interesting insights or findings\n\n1:46:59.540 --> 1:47:03.100\n on the difference between the different drugs?\n\n1:47:03.100 --> 1:47:06.580\n So I think you said meth as well.\n\n1:47:06.580 --> 1:47:09.820\n So cocaine, is there some interesting characteristics\n\n1:47:09.820 --> 1:47:12.020\n about decision making that these drugs alter\n\n1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:14.620\n versus like alcohol, all those kinds of things?\n\n1:47:14.620 --> 1:47:16.740\n I think, and there's much more to study with this,\n\n1:47:16.740 --> 1:47:20.460\n but I think the biggie there is that the stimulants,\n\n1:47:20.460 --> 1:47:23.420\n they create risky sex by really increasing\n\n1:47:24.340 --> 1:47:26.260\n the rewarding value of sex.\n\n1:47:26.260 --> 1:47:27.660\n Like if you talk to people that are really,\n\n1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:30.420\n especially that are hooked on stimulants,\n\n1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:33.580\n one of the biggies is like sex on coke or meth\n\n1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:35.940\n is like so much better than sex without.\n\n1:47:35.940 --> 1:47:38.900\n And that's a big part of why they have trouble quitting\n\n1:47:38.900 --> 1:47:41.740\n because it's so tied to their sex life.\n\n1:47:41.740 --> 1:47:44.300\n So it's not that your decision making is broken,\n\n1:47:44.300 --> 1:47:46.780\n it's just that you, well, you allocate.\n\n1:47:46.780 --> 1:47:48.500\n It's a different aspect of their decision.\n\n1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:49.820\n Yeah, on the reward side.\n\n1:47:49.820 --> 1:47:52.380\n I think on the alcohol, it works more through disinhibition.\n\n1:47:52.380 --> 1:47:56.820\n It's like, alcohol is really good at reducing the ability\n\n1:47:56.820 --> 1:48:00.260\n of a delayed punisher to have an effect on current behavior.\n\n1:48:00.260 --> 1:48:02.020\n In other words, there's this bad thing\n\n1:48:02.020 --> 1:48:04.220\n that's gonna happen tomorrow or a week from now\n\n1:48:04.220 --> 1:48:06.140\n or 20 years from now.\n\n1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:09.220\n Being drunk is a really good way,\n\n1:48:09.220 --> 1:48:11.540\n and you see this in like rats making decisions.\n\n1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:15.580\n A high dose of alcohol makes someone less sensitive\n\n1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:16.700\n to those consequences.\n\n1:48:16.700 --> 1:48:20.180\n So I think that's the lever that's being hit with alcohol\n\n1:48:20.180 --> 1:48:23.100\n and it's the more, just the increasing the rewarding value\n\n1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:26.980\n of sex by the psycho stimulants on that side.\n\n1:48:26.980 --> 1:48:28.940\n We actually found that it, and it was amazing\n\n1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:31.140\n because like hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent\n\n1:48:31.140 --> 1:48:35.980\n by NIH to study the connection between cocaine and HIV.\n\n1:48:35.980 --> 1:48:38.580\n Like we ran the first study on my grant\n\n1:48:38.580 --> 1:48:41.860\n that like actually just gave people cocaine\n\n1:48:41.860 --> 1:48:44.060\n under double blind conditions and showed that like,\n\n1:48:44.060 --> 1:48:45.620\n yeah, when people are on coke,\n\n1:48:46.780 --> 1:48:48.540\n like their ratings of sexual desire,\n\n1:48:48.540 --> 1:48:50.420\n even though they're not in a sexual situation,\n\n1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:51.500\n yeah, you've shown them some pictures,\n\n1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.340\n but they're just saying they're horny.\n\n1:48:53.340 --> 1:48:54.540\n Like you get subjective ratings\n\n1:48:54.540 --> 1:48:57.700\n of like how much sexual desire are you feeling right now.\n\n1:48:57.700 --> 1:49:00.460\n People get horny when they're on stimulants.\n\n1:49:00.460 --> 1:49:03.340\n And a lot of people say, duh,\n\n1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:04.780\n if they really know these drugs.\n\n1:49:04.780 --> 1:49:06.940\n But that's a rigorous study that's in the lab\n\n1:49:06.940 --> 1:49:09.660\n that shows like there's a plot.\n\n1:49:09.660 --> 1:49:12.580\n Right, the dose effects of that, the time course of that.\n\n1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:13.420\n Yeah, it's not just.\n\n1:49:13.420 --> 1:49:16.020\n Can you please tell me there's a paper with a plot\n\n1:49:16.020 --> 1:49:21.020\n that shows dose versus evaluation of like horniness.\n\n1:49:21.220 --> 1:49:22.420\n Yeah, we didn't say horniness.\n\n1:49:22.420 --> 1:49:24.860\n We said sexual arousal, yeah, basically, yeah.\n\n1:49:24.860 --> 1:49:26.580\n There's a plot, I'm gonna find this plot.\n\n1:49:26.580 --> 1:49:27.700\n Right, I'll send it to you.\n\n1:49:27.700 --> 1:49:32.260\n There was one headline from some publicity on the work\n\n1:49:32.260 --> 1:49:36.420\n that said, horny cocaine users don't use condoms\n\n1:49:36.420 --> 1:49:38.260\n or something like that.\n\n1:49:38.260 --> 1:49:39.380\n You gotta love journalism.\n\n1:49:39.380 --> 1:49:41.620\n I wouldn't have put it that way, but like, yeah, that's right.\n\n1:49:41.620 --> 1:49:43.780\n I guess that's what it finds.\n\n1:49:43.780 --> 1:49:47.980\n So you've published a bunch of studies on psychedelics.\n\n1:49:47.980 --> 1:49:52.980\n Is there some especially favorite insightful findings\n\n1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:55.220\n from some of these that you could talk about?\n\n1:49:55.220 --> 1:49:58.380\n So maybe favorite studies or just something\n\n1:49:58.380 --> 1:50:02.020\n that pops to mind in terms of both the goals\n\n1:50:02.020 --> 1:50:04.740\n and like the major insights gained\n\n1:50:04.740 --> 1:50:07.620\n and maybe the side little curiosities\n\n1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:09.500\n that you discovered along the way.\n\n1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:12.940\n Yeah, I think of the work with like using psilocybin\n\n1:50:12.940 --> 1:50:14.420\n to help people quit smoking.\n\n1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:19.420\n And we've talked about smoking being such a serious addiction\n\n1:50:19.420 --> 1:50:23.100\n and so that what inspired me to get into that\n\n1:50:23.100 --> 1:50:26.060\n was just kind of having like behavioral psychology\n\n1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:31.060\n as my primary lens, sort of this sort of like,\n\n1:50:32.340 --> 1:50:36.700\n you know, kind of radical empirical basis of,\n\n1:50:36.700 --> 1:50:40.220\n I'm really interested in the mystical experience\n\n1:50:40.220 --> 1:50:44.180\n and all of these reports, very interested.\n\n1:50:44.180 --> 1:50:47.500\n And, but at the same time, I'm like, okay,\n\n1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:50.500\n let's get down to some behavior change\n\n1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:52.140\n and something that we can record,\n\n1:50:52.140 --> 1:50:55.580\n like quantitatively verify biologically.\n\n1:50:55.580 --> 1:50:58.180\n So find all kinds of negative behaviors\n\n1:50:58.180 --> 1:51:01.420\n that people practice and see if we can turn those\n\n1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:02.900\n into positive or change their behavior.\n\n1:51:02.900 --> 1:51:05.300\n Right, like really change it, not just people saying,\n\n1:51:05.300 --> 1:51:07.140\n which again is interesting, I'm not dismissing it,\n\n1:51:07.140 --> 1:51:09.180\n but folks that say my life has turned around,\n\n1:51:09.180 --> 1:51:11.180\n I feel this has completely changed me.\n\n1:51:11.180 --> 1:51:13.620\n It's like, yep, that's good.\n\n1:51:13.620 --> 1:51:16.500\n All right, let's see if we can harness that and test that.\n\n1:51:16.500 --> 1:51:20.740\n And just something that's real behavior change.\n\n1:51:20.740 --> 1:51:21.580\n You know what I mean?\n\n1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:22.420\n It's quantifiable.\n\n1:51:22.420 --> 1:51:25.260\n It's like, okay, you've been smoking for 30 years,\n\n1:51:25.260 --> 1:51:26.900\n you know, like that's a real thing.\n\n1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.660\n And you've tried a dozen times, like seriously to quit\n\n1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:32.860\n and you haven't been able to long term, like, okay.\n\n1:51:32.860 --> 1:51:35.900\n And if you quit, like we'll ask you and I'll believe you,\n\n1:51:35.900 --> 1:51:38.460\n but I don't trust everyone reading the paper to believe you.\n\n1:51:38.460 --> 1:51:40.900\n So we're gonna have you pee in a cup and we'll test that.\n\n1:51:40.900 --> 1:51:42.340\n And we'll have you blow into this little machine\n\n1:51:42.340 --> 1:51:44.820\n that measures carbon monoxide and we'll test that.\n\n1:51:44.820 --> 1:51:48.220\n So multiple levels of biological verification.\n\n1:51:48.220 --> 1:51:50.340\n Like now we're getting like,\n\n1:51:50.340 --> 1:51:51.900\n to me that's where the rubber meets the road\n\n1:51:51.900 --> 1:51:53.460\n in terms of like therapeutics.\n\n1:51:53.460 --> 1:51:55.580\n It's like, can we really shift behavior?\n\n1:51:55.580 --> 1:51:58.540\n And since, and so much as we've talked about\n\n1:51:58.540 --> 1:52:00.380\n my other scientific work outside of psychedelics\n\n1:52:00.380 --> 1:52:02.940\n is about understanding addiction and drug use.\n\n1:52:02.940 --> 1:52:04.580\n So it's like, you know, looking at addiction,\n\n1:52:04.580 --> 1:52:07.260\n it's a no brainer and smoking is just a great example.\n\n1:52:07.260 --> 1:52:08.940\n And so back to your question,\n\n1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:11.020\n like we've had really high success rates.\n\n1:52:11.020 --> 1:52:14.220\n I mean, it really, it rivals anything that's been published\n\n1:52:14.220 --> 1:52:15.720\n in the scientific literature.\n\n1:52:16.900 --> 1:52:18.340\n The caveat is that, you know,\n\n1:52:18.340 --> 1:52:20.940\n that's based on our initial trial of only 15 people,\n\n1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:23.460\n but extremely high longterm success rates,\n\n1:52:24.300 --> 1:52:27.420\n 80% at six months per smoke free.\n\n1:52:27.420 --> 1:52:29.340\n So can we discuss the details of this?\n\n1:52:29.340 --> 1:52:31.780\n So first of all, which psychedelic are we talking about?\n\n1:52:31.780 --> 1:52:34.340\n And maybe can you talk about the 15 people\n\n1:52:34.340 --> 1:52:37.220\n and how the study ran and what you found?\n\n1:52:37.220 --> 1:52:38.060\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:52:38.060 --> 1:52:40.780\n So the drug we're using is psilocybin\n\n1:52:40.780 --> 1:52:45.780\n and we're using moderately high and high doses of psilocybin.\n\n1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:47.840\n And I should say this about most of our work,\n\n1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:50.540\n these are not kind of museum level doses.\n\n1:52:50.540 --> 1:52:51.940\n In other words, nothing,\n\n1:52:51.940 --> 1:52:53.740\n even big fans of psychedelics wanna take\n\n1:52:53.740 --> 1:52:57.280\n and go to a concert or go to the museum.\n\n1:52:57.280 --> 1:52:59.340\n If someone's at Burning Man on this type of dose,\n\n1:52:59.340 --> 1:53:02.380\n like they're probably gonna wanna find their way back\n\n1:53:02.380 --> 1:53:04.260\n to their tent and zip up and hunker down\n\n1:53:04.260 --> 1:53:07.940\n for, you know, not be around strangers.\n\n1:53:07.940 --> 1:53:10.900\n By the way, the delivery method,\n\n1:53:10.900 --> 1:53:14.660\n so psilocybin is mushrooms, I guess.\n\n1:53:16.060 --> 1:53:19.100\n What's the usual, is it edible?\n\n1:53:19.100 --> 1:53:20.380\n Is there some other way?\n\n1:53:20.380 --> 1:53:21.780\n Like, how is people supposed to think\n\n1:53:21.780 --> 1:53:25.100\n about the correct dosing of these things?\n\n1:53:25.100 --> 1:53:28.240\n Cause I've heard that it's hard to dose correctly.\n\n1:53:29.460 --> 1:53:30.420\n That's right.\n\n1:53:30.420 --> 1:53:33.620\n So in our studies, we use the pure compound psilocybin.\n\n1:53:33.620 --> 1:53:36.700\n So it's a single molecule, you know, a bunch of molecules.\n\n1:53:36.700 --> 1:53:40.260\n And we give them a capsule with that in it.\n\n1:53:41.820 --> 1:53:44.840\n And so it's just, you know, a little capsule, they swallow.\n\n1:53:44.840 --> 1:53:49.840\n What people, when psilocybin is used outside of research,\n\n1:53:49.900 --> 1:53:51.900\n it's always in the context of mushrooms\n\n1:53:53.140 --> 1:53:54.100\n cause they're so easy to grow.\n\n1:53:54.100 --> 1:53:56.220\n There's no market for synthetic psilocybin.\n\n1:53:56.220 --> 1:53:58.060\n There's no reason for that to pop up.\n\n1:53:58.060 --> 1:54:03.060\n The high dose that we use in research is 30 milligrams,\n\n1:54:08.860 --> 1:54:10.060\n body weight adjusted.\n\n1:54:10.060 --> 1:54:11.180\n So if you're a heavier person,\n\n1:54:11.180 --> 1:54:14.580\n it might be like 40 or even 50 milligrams.\n\n1:54:16.100 --> 1:54:18.420\n We have some data that, based on that data,\n\n1:54:18.420 --> 1:54:20.140\n we're actually moving into like getting away\n\n1:54:20.140 --> 1:54:22.400\n from the body weight adjusting of the dose\n\n1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:23.660\n and just giving an absolute dose.\n\n1:54:23.660 --> 1:54:25.040\n It seems like there's no justification\n\n1:54:25.040 --> 1:54:28.140\n for the body weight based dosing, but I digress.\n\n1:54:29.060 --> 1:54:32.860\n Generally 30, 40 milligrams, it's a high dose.\n\n1:54:32.860 --> 1:54:34.940\n And based on average, even though, as you alluded to,\n\n1:54:34.940 --> 1:54:37.820\n there's variability, which gets people into some trouble\n\n1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:40.460\n in terms of mushrooms, like psilocybe cubensis,\n\n1:54:40.460 --> 1:54:42.500\n which is the most common species\n\n1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:44.940\n in the illicit market in the US.\n\n1:54:44.940 --> 1:54:47.740\n This is about equivalent to five dried grams,\n\n1:54:47.740 --> 1:54:51.860\n which is right at about where McKenna and others,\n\n1:54:51.860 --> 1:54:55.580\n they call it a heroic dose.\n\n1:54:55.580 --> 1:54:57.400\n This is not hanging out with your friends,\n\n1:54:57.400 --> 1:54:59.200\n going to the concert again.\n\n1:54:59.200 --> 1:55:03.260\n So this is a real deal dose, even to people that really,\n\n1:55:03.260 --> 1:55:05.060\n just even to psychonauts.\n\n1:55:05.060 --> 1:55:06.700\n And we've even had a number of studies.\n\n1:55:06.700 --> 1:55:07.540\n Psychonauts?\n\n1:55:07.540 --> 1:55:11.140\n Yeah, people that, yeah, astronaut or cosmonaut,\n\n1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:14.380\n like for psychedelics.\n\n1:55:14.380 --> 1:55:16.060\n Yeah, going as far out as possible.\n\n1:55:16.060 --> 1:55:19.260\n But even for them, even for those\n\n1:55:19.260 --> 1:55:21.140\n who've flown to space before.\n\n1:55:21.140 --> 1:55:22.620\n Right, right, they're like, holy shit,\n\n1:55:22.620 --> 1:55:25.820\n I didn't know the orbit would be that far out.\n\n1:55:25.820 --> 1:55:30.300\n Or I escaped the orbit, I was in interplanetary space there.\n\n1:55:31.540 --> 1:55:34.020\n So these folks, the 15 folks in the study,\n\n1:55:34.020 --> 1:55:38.420\n there's not a question of dose being too low\n\n1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.220\n to truly have an impact.\n\n1:55:40.220 --> 1:55:43.140\n Right, right, out of hundreds of volunteers over the years,\n\n1:55:43.140 --> 1:55:44.740\n we've only seen a couple of people\n\n1:55:44.740 --> 1:55:48.660\n where there was a mild effect of the 30 milligrams.\n\n1:55:48.660 --> 1:55:51.500\n And who knows, that person's, their serotonins,\n\n1:55:51.500 --> 1:55:53.500\n they might have lesser density\n\n1:55:53.500 --> 1:55:56.380\n of serotonin 2A receptors or something, we don't know.\n\n1:55:56.380 --> 1:55:57.500\n But it's extremely rare.\n\n1:55:57.500 --> 1:56:00.700\n For most people, this is like something interesting\n\n1:56:00.700 --> 1:56:01.540\n is gonna happen, put it that way.\n\n1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:04.380\n Speaking of Joe Rogan, I think that Jamie,\n\n1:56:04.380 --> 1:56:09.380\n his producer, is immune to psychedelics.\n\n1:56:09.580 --> 1:56:13.020\n So maybe he's a good recruit for the study to test.\n\n1:56:13.020 --> 1:56:13.860\n So that's interesting.\n\n1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:16.060\n Now I'm not, the caveat is I'm not encouraging\n\n1:56:16.060 --> 1:56:19.140\n anything illicit, but just theoretically,\n\n1:56:19.140 --> 1:56:21.780\n my first question as a behavioral pharmacologist\n\n1:56:21.780 --> 1:56:23.540\n is like, you know, increase the dose.\n\n1:56:23.540 --> 1:56:26.260\n You know, like really, let's see the full dose.\n\n1:56:26.260 --> 1:56:27.740\n I'm not telling him, Jamie, to do that,\n\n1:56:27.740 --> 1:56:30.180\n but like, okay, like, you know,\n\n1:56:30.180 --> 1:56:31.180\n you're taking the same amount\n\n1:56:31.180 --> 1:56:33.020\n that friends might be taking, but yeah.\n\n1:56:33.020 --> 1:56:35.900\n But he was also referring to the psychedelic effects\n\n1:56:35.900 --> 1:56:38.700\n of edible marijuana, which is,\n\n1:56:38.700 --> 1:56:46.420\n is there rules on dosage for like marijuana?\n\n1:56:46.420 --> 1:56:47.700\n Is there limits?\n\n1:56:47.700 --> 1:56:50.500\n Like what place where it's, this is, this all goes,\n\n1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:52.060\n it probably is state by state, right?\n\n1:56:52.060 --> 1:56:54.460\n It is, but most, they've gone that direction\n\n1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:56.780\n in states that didn't initially have these rules\n\n1:56:56.780 --> 1:56:57.860\n have now have them.\n\n1:56:57.860 --> 1:56:59.500\n So it was like, you'll get, I think, you know,\n\n1:56:59.500 --> 1:57:04.100\n five, 10 mil, I think 10, five or 10 milligrams of THC\n\n1:57:04.100 --> 1:57:07.980\n being a common, and like, and this is an important thing,\n\n1:57:07.980 --> 1:57:10.300\n like where they've moved from not being allowed to say,\n\n1:57:10.300 --> 1:57:11.580\n like have a whole candy bar\n\n1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:13.940\n and have each of the eight or 10 squares\n\n1:57:13.940 --> 1:57:16.260\n on the candy bar being 10 milligrams,\n\n1:57:16.260 --> 1:57:17.580\n but it's like, no, the whole thing,\n\n1:57:17.580 --> 1:57:19.180\n because like, you know, someone gets a candy bar,\n\n1:57:19.180 --> 1:57:20.900\n they're eating the freaking candy bar.\n\n1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:24.100\n And it's like, unless you're a daily cannabis user,\n\n1:57:24.100 --> 1:57:26.220\n if you take, you know, a hundred milligrams,\n\n1:57:26.220 --> 1:57:30.940\n it's like, that's what could lead to a bad trip for someone.\n\n1:57:30.940 --> 1:57:32.420\n And it's like, you know, a lot of these people,\n\n1:57:32.420 --> 1:57:35.220\n it's like, oh, you used to smoke a little weed in college,\n\n1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:37.460\n they might say they're visiting Denver\n\n1:57:37.460 --> 1:57:39.060\n for a business trip and they're like, why not?\n\n1:57:39.060 --> 1:57:40.340\n Let's give it a shot, you know?\n\n1:57:40.340 --> 1:57:41.900\n And they're like, oh, I don't want to smoke something\n\n1:57:41.900 --> 1:57:43.620\n because it's going to, so I'm going to be safer\n\n1:57:43.620 --> 1:57:47.020\n with this edible, they might consume this massive,\n\n1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:48.780\n you know, but there's huge tolerance.\n\n1:57:48.780 --> 1:57:52.260\n So a regular, like for someone who's smoking weed every day,\n\n1:57:52.260 --> 1:57:53.660\n they might take five milligrams\n\n1:57:53.660 --> 1:57:55.660\n and kind of hardly feel anything.\n\n1:57:55.660 --> 1:58:00.660\n And they may really need something like 30, 40, 50 milligrams\n\n1:58:00.940 --> 1:58:02.180\n to have a strong effect.\n\n1:58:02.180 --> 1:58:06.180\n But yeah, so they've evolved in terms of the rules\n\n1:58:06.180 --> 1:58:11.140\n about like, okay, what constitutes a dose, you know?\n\n1:58:11.140 --> 1:58:13.300\n Which is why you see less big candy bars and more,\n\n1:58:13.300 --> 1:58:15.380\n or if it is a whole candy bar,\n\n1:58:15.380 --> 1:58:17.980\n you're only getting a smaller dose like 10 milligrams or,\n\n1:58:17.980 --> 1:58:20.460\n yeah, because that's where people get in trouble\n\n1:58:20.460 --> 1:58:22.380\n more often with edibles.\n\n1:58:22.380 --> 1:58:25.860\n Yeah, except Joey Diaz, which I've heard.\n\n1:58:25.860 --> 1:58:27.500\n That's definitely somebody I want to talk to\n\n1:58:27.500 --> 1:58:30.100\n out of the crazy comedians I want to talk to as well.\n\n1:58:30.100 --> 1:58:33.660\n Anyway, so yeah, the study of the 15\n\n1:58:33.660 --> 1:58:36.100\n and the dose not being a question.\n\n1:58:36.100 --> 1:58:39.140\n So like, what was the recruitment based on?\n\n1:58:39.140 --> 1:58:44.140\n What was the, like, how did the study get conducted?\n\n1:58:44.460 --> 1:58:46.980\n Yeah, so the recruitment, and I really liked this fact,\n\n1:58:46.980 --> 1:58:49.980\n it wasn't people that, you know, largely were, you know,\n\n1:58:49.980 --> 1:58:51.620\n we were honest about what we were studying,\n\n1:58:51.620 --> 1:58:53.660\n but for most people, it was,\n\n1:58:53.660 --> 1:58:56.220\n they were in the category of like, you know,\n\n1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.380\n not particularly interested in psychedelics,\n\n1:58:58.380 --> 1:59:00.860\n but more of like, they want to quit smoking.\n\n1:59:00.860 --> 1:59:03.700\n They've tried everything but the kitchen sink.\n\n1:59:03.700 --> 1:59:05.500\n And this sounds like the kitchen sink.\n\n1:59:05.500 --> 1:59:08.340\n You know, and it's like, well, it's Hopkins.\n\n1:59:08.340 --> 1:59:11.780\n So, you know, thinking that sounds like it's safe enough.\n\n1:59:11.780 --> 1:59:13.620\n So like, what the hell, let's give it a shot.\n\n1:59:13.620 --> 1:59:15.900\n Like most of them were in that category,\n\n1:59:15.900 --> 1:59:19.820\n which I really, you know, I appreciate\n\n1:59:19.820 --> 1:59:24.820\n because it's more of a test, you know, of, yeah,\n\n1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:26.980\n just like a better model of what,\n\n1:59:26.980 --> 1:59:29.020\n if these are approved as medicines,\n\n1:59:29.020 --> 1:59:31.460\n like what you're going to have the average participant,\n\n1:59:31.460 --> 1:59:34.180\n you know, be like.\n\n1:59:34.180 --> 1:59:37.540\n And so the therapy involves a good amount\n\n1:59:37.540 --> 1:59:41.300\n of non psilocybin sessions, of preparatory sessions,\n\n1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:44.180\n like eight hours of getting to know the person,\n\n1:59:44.180 --> 1:59:45.980\n like the two people who are going to be their guides\n\n1:59:45.980 --> 1:59:48.780\n or the person in the room with them during the experience,\n\n1:59:50.220 --> 1:59:52.140\n having these discussions with them\n\n1:59:52.140 --> 1:59:53.820\n where you're both kind of rapport building,\n\n1:59:53.820 --> 1:59:56.780\n just kind of discussing their life, getting to know them,\n\n1:59:56.780 --> 1:59:58.980\n but then also telling them, preparing them\n\n1:59:58.980 --> 2:00:01.460\n about the psilocybin experience.\n\n2:00:01.460 --> 2:00:03.020\n Oh, it could be scary in this sense,\n\n2:00:03.020 --> 2:00:05.780\n but here's how to handle it, trust, let go, be open.\n\n2:00:05.780 --> 2:00:08.540\n And also during that preparation time,\n\n2:00:08.540 --> 2:00:09.820\n preparing them to quit smoking,\n\n2:00:09.820 --> 2:00:12.220\n using really standard bread and butter techniques\n\n2:00:12.220 --> 2:00:15.180\n that can all fall under the label typically\n\n2:00:15.180 --> 2:00:16.860\n of the cognitive behavioral therapy,\n\n2:00:16.860 --> 2:00:19.820\n just stuff like before you quit,\n\n2:00:19.820 --> 2:00:22.660\n we assign a target quit date ahead of time,\n\n2:00:22.660 --> 2:00:24.460\n you're not just quitting on the fly.\n\n2:00:24.460 --> 2:00:26.660\n And that happens to be the target quit date\n\n2:00:26.660 --> 2:00:27.900\n in our study was the day\n\n2:00:27.900 --> 2:00:29.780\n where they got the first psilocybin dose,\n\n2:00:29.780 --> 2:00:31.700\n but doing things like keeping a smoking diary,\n\n2:00:31.700 --> 2:00:34.700\n like, okay, during the three weeks until you quit,\n\n2:00:34.700 --> 2:00:35.740\n every time you smoke a cigarette,\n\n2:00:35.740 --> 2:00:37.380\n just like jot down what you're doing,\n\n2:00:37.380 --> 2:00:39.860\n what you're feeling, what situation, that type of thing.\n\n2:00:39.860 --> 2:00:41.540\n And then having some discussion around that\n\n2:00:41.540 --> 2:00:44.420\n and then going over the pluses and minuses in their life\n\n2:00:44.420 --> 2:00:45.780\n that smoking kind of comes with\n\n2:00:45.780 --> 2:00:47.900\n and being honest about the, this is what it does for me,\n\n2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:50.140\n this is why I like it, this is why I don't like it.\n\n2:00:50.140 --> 2:00:53.780\n Preparing for like, what if you do slip, how to handle it,\n\n2:00:53.780 --> 2:00:54.820\n like don't dwell on guilt\n\n2:00:54.820 --> 2:00:57.860\n because that leads to more full on relapse,\n\n2:00:57.860 --> 2:00:59.540\n just kind of treat it as a learning experience,\n\n2:00:59.540 --> 2:01:00.380\n that type of thing.\n\n2:01:00.380 --> 2:01:03.580\n Then you have the session day where they come in,\n\n2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:07.540\n five minutes of questionnaires,\n\n2:01:07.540 --> 2:01:09.180\n but pretty much they jump into the,\n\n2:01:09.180 --> 2:01:13.900\n we touch base with them and we give them the capsule.\n\n2:01:13.900 --> 2:01:17.460\n It's a serious setting, but a comfortable one.\n\n2:01:17.460 --> 2:01:19.460\n They're in a room that looks more like a living room\n\n2:01:19.460 --> 2:01:21.100\n than like a research lab.\n\n2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:22.860\n We measure their blood pressure, their experience,\n\n2:01:22.860 --> 2:01:25.620\n but kind of minimal kind of medical vibe to it.\n\n2:01:25.620 --> 2:01:28.860\n And they lay down on a couch\n\n2:01:28.860 --> 2:01:32.020\n and it's a purposefully an introspective experience.\n\n2:01:32.020 --> 2:01:33.140\n So they're laying on a couch\n\n2:01:33.140 --> 2:01:36.340\n during most of the five to six hour experience\n\n2:01:36.340 --> 2:01:38.060\n and they're wearing eye shades,\n\n2:01:38.060 --> 2:01:40.860\n which is a better connotation as a name than blindfold.\n\n2:01:40.860 --> 2:01:42.820\n But like, yeah, so they're wearing eye shades,\n\n2:01:42.820 --> 2:01:45.340\n but that's, and they're wearing headphones\n\n2:01:45.340 --> 2:01:49.060\n through which music is played, mostly classical,\n\n2:01:49.060 --> 2:01:50.540\n although we've done some variation of that.\n\n2:01:50.540 --> 2:01:52.020\n I have a paper that was recently accepted\n\n2:01:52.020 --> 2:01:54.500\n kind of comparing it to more like gongs\n\n2:01:54.500 --> 2:01:57.860\n and harmonic bowls and that type of thing,\n\n2:01:57.860 --> 2:02:00.900\n kind of like sound, you know, kind of.\n\n2:02:00.900 --> 2:02:04.340\n You've also added this to the science\n\n2:02:04.340 --> 2:02:07.220\n and have a paper on the musical accompaniment\n\n2:02:07.220 --> 2:02:09.180\n to the psychedelic experience, that's fascinating.\n\n2:02:09.180 --> 2:02:12.220\n Right, and we found basically that about the same effect,\n\n2:02:12.220 --> 2:02:13.980\n even by a trend, not significant,\n\n2:02:13.980 --> 2:02:15.260\n but a little bit better of an effect,\n\n2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:19.020\n both in terms of subjective experience and longterm,\n\n2:02:19.020 --> 2:02:20.660\n whether it helped people quit smoking,\n\n2:02:20.660 --> 2:02:22.700\n just a little tiny non significant trend\n\n2:02:22.700 --> 2:02:25.980\n even favoring the novel playlist\n\n2:02:25.980 --> 2:02:28.940\n with the Tibetan singing bowls and the gongs\n\n2:02:28.940 --> 2:02:30.620\n and didgeridoo and all of that.\n\n2:02:30.620 --> 2:02:33.340\n And so anyway, just saying, okay,\n\n2:02:33.340 --> 2:02:35.460\n we can deviate a little bit from this,\n\n2:02:35.460 --> 2:02:37.980\n like what goes back to the 1950s of this method\n\n2:02:37.980 --> 2:02:41.100\n of using classical music as part of this psychedelic therapy,\n\n2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:42.300\n but they're listening to the music\n\n2:02:42.300 --> 2:02:44.380\n and they're not playing DJ in real time.\n\n2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:46.780\n You know, it's like, you know, they're just,\n\n2:02:46.780 --> 2:02:49.580\n be the baby, you're not the decision maker for today,\n\n2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:51.740\n go inward, trust, let go, be open.\n\n2:02:51.740 --> 2:02:53.460\n And pretty much the only interaction,\n\n2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:56.300\n like that we're there for is to deal\n\n2:02:56.300 --> 2:02:57.620\n with any anxiety that comes up.\n\n2:02:57.620 --> 2:03:00.500\n So guide is kind of a misnomer in a sense.\n\n2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:02.700\n It's, we're more of a safety net.\n\n2:03:02.700 --> 2:03:05.020\n And so like, tell us if you feel some butterflies\n\n2:03:05.020 --> 2:03:06.220\n that we can provide reassurance,\n\n2:03:06.220 --> 2:03:09.140\n a hold of their hand can be very powerful.\n\n2:03:09.140 --> 2:03:10.980\n I've had people tell me that that was like the thing\n\n2:03:10.980 --> 2:03:12.580\n that really just grounded them.\n\n2:03:12.580 --> 2:03:15.620\n Can you break apart trust, let go, be open?\n\n2:03:17.340 --> 2:03:21.420\n What, so in a sense,\n\n2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.500\n how would you describe the experience,\n\n2:03:25.540 --> 2:03:29.300\n the intellectual and the emotional approach\n\n2:03:29.300 --> 2:03:30.660\n that people are supposed to take\n\n2:03:30.660 --> 2:03:34.260\n to really let go into the experience?\n\n2:03:35.420 --> 2:03:40.420\n Yeah, so trust is, trust the context,\n\n2:03:40.660 --> 2:03:41.900\n you know, trust the guides,\n\n2:03:41.900 --> 2:03:45.140\n trust the overall institutional context.\n\n2:03:45.140 --> 2:03:47.220\n I see it as layers of like safety,\n\n2:03:47.220 --> 2:03:48.460\n even though it's everything I told you\n\n2:03:48.460 --> 2:03:51.100\n about the relative bodily safety of psilocybin.\n\n2:03:51.100 --> 2:03:52.700\n Nonetheless, we're still getting blood pressure\n\n2:03:52.700 --> 2:03:54.660\n throughout the session, just in case.\n\n2:03:54.660 --> 2:03:57.940\n We have a physician on hand who can respond just in case.\n\n2:03:57.940 --> 2:03:59.260\n We're literally across the street\n\n2:03:59.260 --> 2:04:01.460\n from the emergency department, just in case.\n\n2:04:01.460 --> 2:04:02.900\n You know, all of that, you know.\n\n2:04:02.900 --> 2:04:04.940\n Privacy is another thing you've talked about\n\n2:04:04.940 --> 2:04:07.140\n is just trusting that you're,\n\n2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:09.300\n and whatever happens is just between you\n\n2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:10.900\n and the people in the study.\n\n2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:13.340\n Right, and hopefully they've really gotten that\n\n2:04:13.340 --> 2:04:14.820\n by that point deep into the study\n\n2:04:14.820 --> 2:04:17.140\n that like they realize where do we take that seriously\n\n2:04:17.140 --> 2:04:18.380\n and everything else, you know.\n\n2:04:18.380 --> 2:04:20.220\n And so it's really kind of like a very special role\n\n2:04:20.220 --> 2:04:22.780\n that you're playing as a researcher or a guide\n\n2:04:22.780 --> 2:04:25.900\n and hopefully they have your trust.\n\n2:04:25.900 --> 2:04:28.180\n And so, you know, and trust that they could be as emotional,\n\n2:04:28.180 --> 2:04:29.700\n everything from laughter to tears,\n\n2:04:29.700 --> 2:04:30.860\n like that's gonna be welcomed.\n\n2:04:30.860 --> 2:04:31.780\n We're not judging them.\n\n2:04:31.780 --> 2:04:33.700\n It's like, it's a therapeutic relationship\n\n2:04:33.700 --> 2:04:36.460\n where, you know, this is a safe container.\n\n2:04:36.460 --> 2:04:37.540\n It's a safe space.\n\n2:04:37.540 --> 2:04:39.140\n It's a lot of baggage to that term,\n\n2:04:39.140 --> 2:04:42.460\n but it truly is, it's a safe space for that,\n\n2:04:42.460 --> 2:04:45.620\n for this type of experience and to let go.\n\n2:04:45.620 --> 2:04:48.340\n So trust, let's see, let go.\n\n2:04:48.340 --> 2:04:50.540\n So that relates to the emotional, like,\n\n2:04:50.540 --> 2:04:52.940\n you feel like crying, cry.\n\n2:04:52.940 --> 2:04:55.980\n You feel like laughing your ass off, laugh your ass off.\n\n2:04:55.980 --> 2:04:58.140\n You know, it's like all the things actually\n\n2:04:58.140 --> 2:04:59.900\n that sometimes it's more challenging\n\n2:04:59.900 --> 2:05:02.540\n with someone has a large recreational use,\n\n2:05:02.540 --> 2:05:03.540\n sometimes it's harder for them\n\n2:05:03.540 --> 2:05:07.340\n because people in that context, and understandably so,\n\n2:05:07.340 --> 2:05:09.380\n it's more about holding your shit.\n\n2:05:09.380 --> 2:05:12.480\n Someone's had a bunch of mushrooms at a party.\n\n2:05:12.480 --> 2:05:15.020\n Maybe they don't wanna go into the back room\n\n2:05:15.020 --> 2:05:17.380\n and start crying about these thoughts\n\n2:05:17.380 --> 2:05:19.500\n about the relationship with their mother.\n\n2:05:19.500 --> 2:05:22.620\n And they don't wanna be the drama queen or king\n\n2:05:22.620 --> 2:05:23.860\n that bring their friends down\n\n2:05:23.860 --> 2:05:26.340\n because their friends are having an experience too.\n\n2:05:26.340 --> 2:05:29.060\n And so they wanna like compose, you know.\n\n2:05:29.060 --> 2:05:31.440\n And also just the appearance in social settings\n\n2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:34.980\n versus the, so like prioritizing how you appear to others\n\n2:05:34.980 --> 2:05:39.420\n versus the prioritizing the depth of the experience.\n\n2:05:39.420 --> 2:05:42.700\n And here in the study, you can prioritize the experience.\n\n2:05:42.700 --> 2:05:44.980\n Right, and it's all about, like you're the astronaut\n\n2:05:44.980 --> 2:05:46.820\n and there's only one astronaut.\n\n2:05:46.820 --> 2:05:48.100\n We're ground control.\n\n2:05:48.100 --> 2:05:49.660\n And I use this often with,\n\n2:05:50.620 --> 2:05:53.580\n I have a photo of the space shuttle on a plaque\n\n2:05:53.580 --> 2:05:56.720\n in my office and I kind of often use that as an example.\n\n2:05:56.720 --> 2:05:58.340\n And it's like, we're here for you.\n\n2:05:58.340 --> 2:06:00.300\n Like we're a team, but we have different roles.\n\n2:06:00.300 --> 2:06:04.140\n It's just like, you don't have to like compose yourself.\n\n2:06:04.140 --> 2:06:07.340\n Like you don't have to like be concerned about our safety.\n\n2:06:07.340 --> 2:06:09.500\n Like we're playing these roles today.\n\n2:06:09.500 --> 2:06:12.400\n And like, yeah, your job is to go as deep as possible\n\n2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:16.140\n or as far out, whatever your analogy is, like as possible.\n\n2:06:16.140 --> 2:06:18.820\n And we're keeping you safe.\n\n2:06:18.820 --> 2:06:23.580\n And so, yeah, and the emotional side is a hard one\n\n2:06:23.580 --> 2:06:25.340\n because you really want people to,\n\n2:06:25.340 --> 2:06:28.180\n like if they go into realms of subjectively\n\n2:06:28.180 --> 2:06:33.180\n of despair and sorrow, like, yeah, like cry, it's okay.\n\n2:06:34.580 --> 2:06:37.120\n And especially if someone's more macho\n\n2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:41.420\n and you want this to be the place where they can let go.\n\n2:06:41.420 --> 2:06:44.540\n And again, something that they wouldn't or shouldn't do\n\n2:06:44.540 --> 2:06:46.700\n if someone were to theoretically use it\n\n2:06:46.700 --> 2:06:49.980\n in a social setting.\n\n2:06:49.980 --> 2:06:51.700\n And like, and also these other things,\n\n2:06:51.700 --> 2:06:54.260\n like even that you get in those social settings of like,\n\n2:06:54.260 --> 2:06:56.660\n yeah, you don't have to like worry about your wallet\n\n2:06:56.660 --> 2:06:59.240\n for being taken advantage or especially for a woman\n\n2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:02.620\n sexually assaulted by some creep at a concert or something.\n\n2:07:02.620 --> 2:07:05.480\n Cause they're, you know, they're laying down,\n\n2:07:05.480 --> 2:07:06.320\n being far out.\n\n2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:08.380\n There's like a million sources of anxiety\n\n2:07:08.380 --> 2:07:11.420\n that are external versus internal.\n\n2:07:11.420 --> 2:07:12.920\n So you can just focus on your own,\n\n2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:16.420\n like the beautiful thing that's going on in your mind.\n\n2:07:16.420 --> 2:07:18.340\n And even the cops at that layer,\n\n2:07:18.340 --> 2:07:21.820\n even though it's extremely unlikely for most people\n\n2:07:21.820 --> 2:07:23.820\n that cops would come in and bust them right when,\n\n2:07:23.820 --> 2:07:25.220\n like even at that theoretical,\n\n2:07:25.220 --> 2:07:26.900\n like that one in a billion chance,\n\n2:07:26.900 --> 2:07:29.420\n like that might be a real thing psychologically.\n\n2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:31.380\n In this context, we even got that covered.\n\n2:07:31.380 --> 2:07:33.460\n This is, we've got DEA approval.\n\n2:07:33.460 --> 2:07:37.220\n Like you are, this is okay by every level of society\n\n2:07:37.220 --> 2:07:39.980\n that counts, you know, that has the authority.\n\n2:07:39.980 --> 2:07:43.620\n So it's, so go deep, trust the, you know, trust the setting,\n\n2:07:43.620 --> 2:07:48.020\n trust yourself, you know, let go and be open.\n\n2:07:48.020 --> 2:07:50.500\n So in the experience, and this is all subjective\n\n2:07:50.500 --> 2:07:54.100\n and by analogy, but like, if there's a door, open it,\n\n2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:54.940\n go into it.\n\n2:07:54.940 --> 2:07:59.940\n If there's a stairwell, go down it or a stairway, go up it.\n\n2:07:59.980 --> 2:08:03.220\n If there's a monster in the mind's eye, you know,\n\n2:08:03.220 --> 2:08:07.380\n don't run, approach it, look in the eye and say, you know,\n\n2:08:07.380 --> 2:08:08.220\n let's talk.\n\n2:08:08.220 --> 2:08:10.900\n Yeah, what's up, what are you doing here?\n\n2:08:10.900 --> 2:08:12.620\n Let's talk Turkey, you know?\n\n2:08:12.620 --> 2:08:13.460\n And I thought.\n\n2:08:13.460 --> 2:08:14.820\n Dave Goggins entered the chat, okay.\n\n2:08:14.820 --> 2:08:16.380\n Right, right, it really is that,\n\n2:08:16.380 --> 2:08:19.780\n that really is a heart of it, this radical courage.\n\n2:08:19.780 --> 2:08:20.940\n Like it. Courage.\n\n2:08:20.940 --> 2:08:22.660\n People are often struck by that coming out.\n\n2:08:22.660 --> 2:08:25.480\n Like this is heavy lifting, this is a hard work.\n\n2:08:25.480 --> 2:08:30.160\n People come out of this exhausted and it can be extremely,\n\n2:08:30.160 --> 2:08:31.960\n some people say it's the most difficult thing\n\n2:08:31.960 --> 2:08:33.380\n they've done in their life.\n\n2:08:33.380 --> 2:08:36.160\n Like choosing to let go on a moment,\n\n2:08:36.160 --> 2:08:39.740\n a microsecond by microsecond basis.\n\n2:08:39.740 --> 2:08:42.940\n Everything in their inclination is to say stop,\n\n2:08:42.940 --> 2:08:45.020\n sometimes stop this, I don't like this,\n\n2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:48.160\n I didn't know it was gonna be like this, this is too much.\n\n2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:49.840\n And Terrence McKenna put it this way,\n\n2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:52.740\n it's like comparing to meditation and other techniques,\n\n2:08:52.740 --> 2:08:55.960\n it's like spending years trying to press the accelerator\n\n2:08:55.960 --> 2:08:57.460\n to make something happen.\n\n2:08:57.460 --> 2:08:59.660\n High dose psychedelics is like you're speeding down\n\n2:08:59.660 --> 2:09:03.200\n the mountain in a fully loaded semi truck\n\n2:09:03.200 --> 2:09:06.380\n and you're charged with not slamming the brake.\n\n2:09:06.380 --> 2:09:09.820\n It's like, let it happen.\n\n2:09:09.820 --> 2:09:12.300\n So it's very difficult and to engage,\n\n2:09:12.300 --> 2:09:16.500\n always go further into it and take that radical,\n\n2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:19.260\n radical courage throughout.\n\n2:09:19.260 --> 2:09:22.580\n What do they say in self report?\n\n2:09:22.580 --> 2:09:24.580\n If you can put general words to it,\n\n2:09:24.580 --> 2:09:26.180\n what is their experience like?\n\n2:09:26.180 --> 2:09:27.820\n What do they say it's like?\n\n2:09:27.820 --> 2:09:29.400\n Because these are many people, like you said,\n\n2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:32.980\n that haven't probably read much about psychedelics\n\n2:09:32.980 --> 2:09:35.000\n or they don't have like with Joe Rogan,\n\n2:09:36.300 --> 2:09:39.020\n like language or stories to put on it.\n\n2:09:39.020 --> 2:09:43.700\n So this is very raw self report of experiences.\n\n2:09:43.700 --> 2:09:45.860\n What do they say the experience is like?\n\n2:09:45.860 --> 2:09:47.540\n Yeah, and some more so than others,\n\n2:09:47.540 --> 2:09:50.180\n cause everyone has been exposed at some level or another,\n\n2:09:50.180 --> 2:09:53.160\n but some it is pretty superficial as you're saying.\n\n2:09:55.500 --> 2:09:57.020\n One of the hallmarks of psychedelics\n\n2:09:57.020 --> 2:09:58.460\n is just their variability.\n\n2:09:58.460 --> 2:10:00.060\n So I'm more stressed, it's like not the mean,\n\n2:10:00.060 --> 2:10:03.420\n but the standard deviation is so wide that it's like,\n\n2:10:03.420 --> 2:10:07.140\n it could be like hellish experiences\n\n2:10:07.140 --> 2:10:12.140\n and just absolutely beautiful and loving experiences,\n\n2:10:14.100 --> 2:10:17.420\n everything in between and both of those,\n\n2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:20.340\n like those could be two minutes apart from each other.\n\n2:10:20.340 --> 2:10:24.040\n And sometimes kind of at the same time concurrently.\n\n2:10:24.040 --> 2:10:28.180\n So let's see, there's different ways to,\n\n2:10:28.180 --> 2:10:31.820\n there were some Jungian psychologists back in the 60s,\n\n2:10:31.820 --> 2:10:34.060\n masters in Houston that wrote a really good book,\n\n2:10:34.060 --> 2:10:36.340\n The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience,\n\n2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:39.300\n which is a play on varieties of religious experience\n\n2:10:39.300 --> 2:10:43.460\n by William James, that they described this,\n\n2:10:43.460 --> 2:10:44.580\n a perceptual level.\n\n2:10:44.580 --> 2:10:47.180\n So most people have that when,\n\n2:10:47.180 --> 2:10:49.460\n whether they're looking at the room without the eyeshades on\n\n2:10:49.460 --> 2:10:52.640\n or inside their mind's eye with the eyeshades on,\n\n2:10:52.640 --> 2:10:56.340\n colors, sounds like this,\n\n2:10:56.340 --> 2:11:01.060\n it's a much richer sensorium,\n\n2:11:01.060 --> 2:11:02.420\n which can be very interesting.\n\n2:11:02.420 --> 2:11:04.980\n And then at another level, a master's in Houston\n\n2:11:04.980 --> 2:11:08.020\n called it the psychodynamic level.\n\n2:11:08.020 --> 2:11:10.660\n And I think you could think about it more broadly than,\n\n2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:11.880\n that's kind of Jungian,\n\n2:11:11.880 --> 2:11:14.620\n but just the personal psychological levels,\n\n2:11:14.620 --> 2:11:17.020\n how I think of it, like this is about your life.\n\n2:11:17.020 --> 2:11:17.980\n There's a whole life review.\n\n2:11:17.980 --> 2:11:20.300\n Oftentimes people have thoughts about their childhood,\n\n2:11:20.300 --> 2:11:24.340\n about their relationships, their spouse or partner,\n\n2:11:24.340 --> 2:11:27.940\n their children, their parents, their family of origin,\n\n2:11:27.940 --> 2:11:31.760\n their current family, that stuff comes up a lot,\n\n2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:35.820\n including people just pouring with tears\n\n2:11:35.820 --> 2:11:39.900\n about how much, it hits them so hard\n\n2:11:39.900 --> 2:11:41.720\n how much they love people.\n\n2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:44.700\n Like in a way, for people that they'd love their family,\n\n2:11:44.700 --> 2:11:49.700\n but it just hits them so hard that how important this is\n\n2:11:50.660 --> 2:11:52.340\n and the magnitude of that love\n\n2:11:52.340 --> 2:11:54.380\n and what that means in their life.\n\n2:11:54.380 --> 2:11:57.140\n So those are some of the most moving experiences\n\n2:11:57.140 --> 2:12:00.340\n to be present for is where people like it hits home,\n\n2:12:00.340 --> 2:12:02.820\n like what really matters in their life.\n\n2:12:02.820 --> 2:12:06.700\n And then you have this sort of what masters in Houston\n\n2:12:06.700 --> 2:12:08.620\n called the archetypal realm,\n\n2:12:08.620 --> 2:12:12.460\n which again is sort of Jungian with the focus on archetypes,\n\n2:12:12.460 --> 2:12:13.300\n which is interesting,\n\n2:12:13.300 --> 2:12:15.980\n but I think of that more generally as like symbolic level.\n\n2:12:15.980 --> 2:12:19.340\n So just really deep experiences where you have,\n\n2:12:19.340 --> 2:12:22.980\n you do have experiences that seem symbolic of,\n\n2:12:22.980 --> 2:12:25.660\n very much in like what we know about dreaming\n\n2:12:25.660 --> 2:12:27.420\n and what most people think about dreaming,\n\n2:12:27.420 --> 2:12:29.560\n like there's this randomness of things,\n\n2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:31.780\n but sometimes it's pretty clear in retrospect,\n\n2:12:31.780 --> 2:12:33.460\n oh, like this came up\n\n2:12:33.460 --> 2:12:36.960\n because this thing has been on my mind recently.\n\n2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:40.260\n So it seems to be, there seems to be this symbolic level.\n\n2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:41.460\n And then they have this,\n\n2:12:41.460 --> 2:12:42.980\n the last level that they describe\n\n2:12:42.980 --> 2:12:45.460\n is the mystical integral level,\n\n2:12:45.460 --> 2:12:48.340\n which this is where there's lots of terms for it,\n\n2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:52.200\n but transcendental experiences, experiences of unity,\n\n2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:56.180\n mystical type effects we often measure.\n\n2:12:56.180 --> 2:12:57.620\n Europeans use a scale\n\n2:12:57.620 --> 2:13:00.280\n that will refer to oceanic boundlessness.\n\n2:13:00.280 --> 2:13:02.580\n This is all pretty much the same thing.\n\n2:13:02.580 --> 2:13:04.860\n This is like at some sense,\n\n2:13:04.860 --> 2:13:08.240\n the deepest level of the very sense of self\n\n2:13:08.240 --> 2:13:13.240\n seems to be dissolved, minimize, or expanded,\n\n2:13:13.700 --> 2:13:16.140\n such that the boundaries of the self go into in here.\n\n2:13:16.140 --> 2:13:17.580\n I think some of this is just semantics,\n\n2:13:17.580 --> 2:13:19.820\n but whether the self is expanding\n\n2:13:19.820 --> 2:13:21.700\n such that there's no boundary between the self\n\n2:13:21.700 --> 2:13:24.040\n and the rest of the universe,\n\n2:13:24.040 --> 2:13:25.900\n or whether there's no sense of self,\n\n2:13:25.900 --> 2:13:27.200\n again, might be just semantics,\n\n2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:30.060\n but this radical shift or sense of loss\n\n2:13:30.060 --> 2:13:33.060\n of sense of self or self boundaries.\n\n2:13:33.060 --> 2:13:34.900\n And that's like the most,\n\n2:13:34.900 --> 2:13:37.060\n typically when people have that experience,\n\n2:13:37.060 --> 2:13:40.300\n they'll often report that as being the most remarkable thing.\n\n2:13:40.300 --> 2:13:43.420\n And this is what you don't typically get with MDMA,\n\n2:13:43.420 --> 2:13:46.800\n these deepest levels of the nature of reality itself,\n\n2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:48.600\n the subjectivity and objectivity,\n\n2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:53.600\n just like the seer and the seen become one,\n\n2:13:54.640 --> 2:13:58.460\n and it's a process, and yeah.\n\n2:13:58.460 --> 2:14:02.660\n And they're able to bring that experience back\n\n2:14:04.300 --> 2:14:06.620\n and be able to describe it?\n\n2:14:06.620 --> 2:14:09.380\n Yeah, but one of the, to a degree,\n\n2:14:09.380 --> 2:14:11.760\n but one of the hallmarks going back to William James\n\n2:14:11.760 --> 2:14:15.560\n of describing a mystical experience is the ineffability.\n\n2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:17.660\n And so even though it's ineffable,\n\n2:14:17.660 --> 2:14:20.380\n people try as far as they can to describe it,\n\n2:14:20.380 --> 2:14:22.480\n but when you get the real deal, they'll say,\n\n2:14:22.480 --> 2:14:24.480\n and even though they say a lot of helpful things\n\n2:14:24.480 --> 2:14:26.200\n to help you describe the landscape,\n\n2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:28.580\n they'll say, no matter what I say,\n\n2:14:28.580 --> 2:14:31.460\n I'm still not even coming anywhere close to what this was.\n\n2:14:31.460 --> 2:14:34.000\n Like the language is completely failing.\n\n2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:36.660\n And I like to joke that even though it's ineffable,\n\n2:14:36.660 --> 2:14:37.620\n and we're researchers,\n\n2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:38.940\n so we try to eff it up\n\n2:14:38.940 --> 2:14:41.260\n by asking them to describe the experience.\n\n2:14:41.260 --> 2:14:44.140\n I love it, it's a good one.\n\n2:14:44.140 --> 2:14:46.320\n But to bring it back a little bit,\n\n2:14:46.320 --> 2:14:50.340\n so for that particular study on tobacco,\n\n2:14:50.340 --> 2:14:54.500\n what was the results, what was the conclusions\n\n2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:59.360\n in terms of the impact of psilocybin on their addiction?\n\n2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:01.500\n So in that pilot study, it was very small\n\n2:15:01.500 --> 2:15:04.160\n and it wasn't a randomized study, so it was limited.\n\n2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:06.320\n The only question we could really answer was,\n\n2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:08.500\n is this worthy enough of followup?\n\n2:15:08.500 --> 2:15:11.060\n And the answer to that was absolutely,\n\n2:15:11.060 --> 2:15:12.540\n because the success rates were so high,\n\n2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:15.980\n 80% biologically confirmed successful at six months,\n\n2:15:15.980 --> 2:15:19.580\n that held up to 60% biologically confirmed abstinent\n\n2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:22.900\n at an average of two and a half years, a very long fall.\n\n2:15:22.900 --> 2:15:26.340\n Yeah, and so, I mean, the best that's been reported\n\n2:15:26.340 --> 2:15:28.340\n in the literature for smoking cessation\n\n2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:30.580\n is in the upper 50%, and that's with not one,\n\n2:15:30.580 --> 2:15:32.900\n but two medications for a couple of months,\n\n2:15:32.900 --> 2:15:36.460\n followed by regular cognitive behavioral therapy,\n\n2:15:36.460 --> 2:15:38.880\n where you're coming in once a week or once every few weeks\n\n2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:41.020\n for an entire year.\n\n2:15:41.020 --> 2:15:44.620\n And so it was very heavy.\n\n2:15:44.620 --> 2:15:48.020\n This is just like a few uses of psilocybin?\n\n2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:50.020\n So this was three doses of psilocybin\n\n2:15:50.020 --> 2:15:52.620\n over a total course, including preparation, everything,\n\n2:15:52.620 --> 2:15:55.340\n a 15 week period, where there's mainly like,\n\n2:15:56.380 --> 2:15:58.300\n for most part, one meeting a week,\n\n2:15:58.300 --> 2:16:00.820\n and then the three sessions are within that.\n\n2:16:00.820 --> 2:16:02.980\n And so it's, and we scaled that back\n\n2:16:02.980 --> 2:16:05.540\n in the more, the study we're doing right now,\n\n2:16:05.540 --> 2:16:06.460\n which I can tell you about,\n\n2:16:06.460 --> 2:16:09.160\n which is a randomized controlled trial.\n\n2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:14.160\n But it's, yeah, the original pilot study\n\n2:16:17.740 --> 2:16:20.540\n was these 15 people.\n\n2:16:20.540 --> 2:16:23.380\n So given the positive signal from the first study\n\n2:16:23.380 --> 2:16:25.020\n telling us that it was a worthy pursuit,\n\n2:16:25.020 --> 2:16:25.940\n we hustled up some money\n\n2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:28.580\n to actually be able to afford a larger trial.\n\n2:16:28.580 --> 2:16:30.580\n So it's randomizing 80 people\n\n2:16:30.580 --> 2:16:33.700\n to get either one psilocybin session,\n\n2:16:33.700 --> 2:16:36.960\n we've scaled that down from three to one,\n\n2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:40.000\n mainly because we're doing fMRI neuroimaging\n\n2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:40.840\n before and after,\n\n2:16:40.840 --> 2:16:42.380\n and it made it more experimentally complex\n\n2:16:42.380 --> 2:16:45.100\n to have multiple sessions.\n\n2:16:45.100 --> 2:16:49.620\n But one psilocybin session versus the nicotine patch\n\n2:16:49.620 --> 2:16:52.260\n using the FDA approved label,\n\n2:16:52.260 --> 2:16:53.900\n like standard use of the nicotine patch.\n\n2:16:53.900 --> 2:16:57.100\n So it's randomized, 40 people get randomized to psilocybin,\n\n2:16:57.100 --> 2:17:00.140\n one session, 40 people get nicotine patch.\n\n2:17:00.140 --> 2:17:02.340\n And they all get the same cognitive behavioral therapy\n\n2:17:02.340 --> 2:17:03.900\n sort of the standard talk therapy.\n\n2:17:03.900 --> 2:17:05.400\n And we've scaled it down somewhat,\n\n2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:07.220\n so there's less weekly meetings,\n\n2:17:07.220 --> 2:17:09.020\n but it's within the same ballpark.\n\n2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:10.920\n And right now we're still,\n\n2:17:13.920 --> 2:17:16.020\n the study's still ongoing.\n\n2:17:16.020 --> 2:17:18.460\n And in fact, we just recently started recruiting again,\n\n2:17:18.460 --> 2:17:19.580\n we paused for COVID.\n\n2:17:19.580 --> 2:17:21.860\n Now we're starting back up with some protections\n\n2:17:21.860 --> 2:17:23.340\n like masks and whatnot.\n\n2:17:23.340 --> 2:17:28.340\n But right now for the 44 people\n\n2:17:28.620 --> 2:17:31.080\n who have gotten through the one year followup,\n\n2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:33.580\n and so that includes 22 from each of the two groups,\n\n2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:36.180\n the success rates are extremely high.\n\n2:17:36.180 --> 2:17:37.540\n For the psilocybin group,\n\n2:17:37.540 --> 2:17:41.300\n it's 59% have been biologically confirmed as smoke free\n\n2:17:41.300 --> 2:17:43.980\n at one year after their quit date.\n\n2:17:43.980 --> 2:17:48.180\n And that compares to 27% for the nicotine patch,\n\n2:17:48.180 --> 2:17:51.000\n which by the way is extremely good for the nicotine patch\n\n2:17:51.000 --> 2:17:53.060\n compared to previous research.\n\n2:17:53.060 --> 2:17:56.980\n So the results could change because it's ongoing,\n\n2:17:56.980 --> 2:17:58.260\n but we're mostly done\n\n2:17:58.260 --> 2:18:01.380\n and it's still looking extremely positive.\n\n2:18:01.380 --> 2:18:02.360\n So if anyone's interested,\n\n2:18:02.360 --> 2:18:04.460\n they have to be sort of be in commuting distance\n\n2:18:04.460 --> 2:18:06.580\n to the Baltimore area, but you know.\n\n2:18:06.580 --> 2:18:07.420\n To participate.\n\n2:18:07.420 --> 2:18:09.640\n Right, right, to participate.\n\n2:18:09.640 --> 2:18:13.660\n This is a good moment to bring up something.\n\n2:18:13.660 --> 2:18:17.900\n I think a lot of what you talked about is super interesting.\n\n2:18:17.900 --> 2:18:19.940\n And I think a lot of people listening to this,\n\n2:18:19.940 --> 2:18:24.940\n so now it's anywhere from 300 to 600,000 people\n\n2:18:25.140 --> 2:18:27.180\n for just a regular podcast.\n\n2:18:27.180 --> 2:18:29.420\n I know a lot of them will be very interested\n\n2:18:29.420 --> 2:18:32.820\n in what you're saying and they're going to look you up.\n\n2:18:32.820 --> 2:18:34.580\n They're going to find your email\n\n2:18:34.580 --> 2:18:36.840\n and they're going to write you a long email\n\n2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:39.700\n about some of the interesting things they've found\n\n2:18:40.840 --> 2:18:42.320\n in any of your papers.\n\n2:18:43.420 --> 2:18:45.900\n How should people contact you?\n\n2:18:45.900 --> 2:18:47.940\n What is the best way for that?\n\n2:18:47.940 --> 2:18:49.300\n Would you recommend?\n\n2:18:49.300 --> 2:18:50.780\n You're a super busy guy.\n\n2:18:50.780 --> 2:18:52.580\n You have a million things going on.\n\n2:18:54.340 --> 2:18:56.540\n How should people communicate with you?\n\n2:18:56.540 --> 2:18:57.740\n Thanks for bringing this up.\n\n2:18:57.740 --> 2:19:01.900\n This is a, I'm glad to get the opportunity to address this.\n\n2:19:01.900 --> 2:19:04.980\n If someone's interested in participating in a study,\n\n2:19:04.980 --> 2:19:07.260\n the best thing to do is go to the website.\n\n2:19:08.100 --> 2:19:13.100\n Of the study or of like, yeah, which website?\n\n2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:15.780\n So we have all of our psilocybin studies.\n\n2:19:15.780 --> 2:19:18.800\n So everything we have is up on one website\n\n2:19:18.800 --> 2:19:21.120\n and then we link to the different study websites,\n\n2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:24.500\n but hopkinspsychedelic.org.\n\n2:19:24.500 --> 2:19:27.440\n So everything we do, or if you don't remember that,\n\n2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:29.940\n just go to your favorite search engine\n\n2:19:29.940 --> 2:19:32.080\n and look up Johns Hopkins Psychedelic\n\n2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:33.600\n and you're going to find one of the first hits\n\n2:19:33.600 --> 2:19:35.920\n is going to be our, is this website.\n\n2:19:35.920 --> 2:19:38.060\n And there's going to be links to the smoking study\n\n2:19:38.060 --> 2:19:39.120\n and all of our other studies.\n\n2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:40.900\n If there's no link to it there,\n\n2:19:40.900 --> 2:19:42.600\n we don't have a study on it now.\n\n2:19:42.600 --> 2:19:46.220\n And if you're interested in psychedelic research more broadly,\n\n2:19:46.220 --> 2:19:48.300\n you can look up, like at another university\n\n2:19:48.300 --> 2:19:49.460\n that might be closer to you.\n\n2:19:49.460 --> 2:19:52.240\n And there's a handful of them now across the country.\n\n2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:55.140\n And there's some in Europe that have studies going on,\n\n2:19:55.140 --> 2:19:56.900\n but you can, at least in the US,\n\n2:19:56.900 --> 2:20:00.200\n you can look at clinicaltrials.gov\n\n2:20:00.200 --> 2:20:02.180\n and look up the term psilocybin.\n\n2:20:02.180 --> 2:20:04.420\n And in fact, optionally people even in Europe\n\n2:20:04.420 --> 2:20:06.180\n can register their trial on there.\n\n2:20:06.180 --> 2:20:07.620\n So that's a good way to find studies.\n\n2:20:07.620 --> 2:20:11.340\n But for our research, rather than emailing me,\n\n2:20:11.340 --> 2:20:13.540\n like a more efficient way is to go straight\n\n2:20:13.540 --> 2:20:17.060\n and you can do that first, the first phase of screening.\n\n2:20:17.060 --> 2:20:18.660\n There's some questions online\n\n2:20:18.660 --> 2:20:21.900\n and then someone will get back in touch with you.\n\n2:20:21.900 --> 2:20:24.860\n But I do already, you know,\n\n2:20:24.860 --> 2:20:29.580\n and I expect it's like going to increase,\n\n2:20:29.580 --> 2:20:32.940\n but I'm already at the level where my simple limited mind\n\n2:20:32.940 --> 2:20:34.380\n and limited capacity is already,\n\n2:20:34.380 --> 2:20:37.660\n I sometimes fail to get back to emails.\n\n2:20:37.660 --> 2:20:39.780\n I mean, I'm trying to respond to my colleagues,\n\n2:20:39.780 --> 2:20:43.540\n my mentees, all these things, my responsibilities.\n\n2:20:43.540 --> 2:20:45.820\n And as many of the people just inquiring\n\n2:20:45.820 --> 2:20:47.440\n about I wanna go to graduate school,\n\n2:20:47.440 --> 2:20:49.660\n I'm interested in this, I had this,\n\n2:20:49.660 --> 2:20:51.020\n I have a daughter that took a psychedelic\n\n2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:51.860\n and she's having trouble.\n\n2:20:51.860 --> 2:20:54.720\n And it's like, I try to respond to those,\n\n2:20:54.720 --> 2:20:58.020\n but sometimes I just simply can't get to all of it already.\n\n2:20:58.020 --> 2:21:00.660\n To be honest, like from my perspective,\n\n2:21:00.660 --> 2:21:03.460\n it's been quite heartbreaking\n\n2:21:03.460 --> 2:21:07.380\n because I basically don't respond to any emails anymore.\n\n2:21:07.380 --> 2:21:11.940\n And especially as you mentioned mentees and so on,\n\n2:21:11.940 --> 2:21:14.060\n like outside of that circle,\n\n2:21:14.060 --> 2:21:16.500\n it's heartbreaking to me how many brilliant people\n\n2:21:16.500 --> 2:21:19.740\n there are, thoughtful people, like loving people.\n\n2:21:19.740 --> 2:21:22.580\n And they write long emails that are really,\n\n2:21:22.580 --> 2:21:26.300\n by the way, I do read them very often.\n\n2:21:26.300 --> 2:21:28.060\n It's just that I don't,\n\n2:21:28.060 --> 2:21:31.740\n the response is then you're starting a conversation.\n\n2:21:31.740 --> 2:21:35.500\n And the heartbreaking aspect is you only have\n\n2:21:35.500 --> 2:21:37.980\n so many hours in the day to have deep,\n\n2:21:37.980 --> 2:21:40.860\n meaningful conversations with human beings on this earth.\n\n2:21:40.860 --> 2:21:42.540\n And so you have to select who they are.\n\n2:21:42.540 --> 2:21:43.700\n And usually it's your family,\n\n2:21:43.700 --> 2:21:46.300\n it's people like you're directly working with.\n\n2:21:46.300 --> 2:21:48.660\n And even I guarantee you with this conversation,\n\n2:21:48.660 --> 2:21:53.660\n people will write you long, really thoughtful emails.\n\n2:21:54.220 --> 2:21:55.840\n Like there'll be brilliant people,\n\n2:21:55.840 --> 2:21:59.300\n faculty from all over, PhD students from all over.\n\n2:21:59.300 --> 2:22:00.320\n And it's heartbreaking\n\n2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:01.660\n because you can't really get back to them.\n\n2:22:01.660 --> 2:22:04.380\n But you're saying like many of them,\n\n2:22:04.380 --> 2:22:06.420\n if you do respond, it's more like here,\n\n2:22:06.420 --> 2:22:10.540\n go to this website when you're interested into the study,\n\n2:22:10.540 --> 2:22:13.180\n just it makes sense to directly go to the site\n\n2:22:13.180 --> 2:22:16.420\n if there's applications open, just apply for the study.\n\n2:22:16.420 --> 2:22:19.780\n Right, right, right, as either a volunteer\n\n2:22:19.780 --> 2:22:22.840\n or if we're looking for somebody,\n\n2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:25.220\n we're gonna be posting,\n\n2:22:25.220 --> 2:22:28.260\n including on the Hopkins University website,\n\n2:22:28.260 --> 2:22:30.940\n we're gonna be posting if we're looking for a position.\n\n2:22:30.940 --> 2:22:32.580\n I am right now actually looking through\n\n2:22:32.580 --> 2:22:35.420\n and it's mainly been through email and contacts,\n\n2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:37.920\n but should I say it?\n\n2:22:37.920 --> 2:22:39.140\n I think I'd rather cast my nets wide,\n\n2:22:39.140 --> 2:22:40.860\n but I'm looking for a postdoc right now.\n\n2:22:40.860 --> 2:22:41.740\n Oh, great.\n\n2:22:41.740 --> 2:22:44.740\n So I've mentored postdocs for, I don't know,\n\n2:22:44.740 --> 2:22:46.340\n like a dozen years or so.\n\n2:22:46.340 --> 2:22:47.860\n And more and more of their time\n\n2:22:47.860 --> 2:22:50.060\n is being spent on psychedelics.\n\n2:22:50.060 --> 2:22:52.220\n So someone's free to contact me.\n\n2:22:52.220 --> 2:22:54.880\n That's more of a, that's sort of so close to home.\n\n2:22:54.880 --> 2:22:56.740\n That's a personal, you know,\n\n2:22:56.740 --> 2:22:58.380\n that like emailing me about that.\n\n2:22:58.380 --> 2:23:01.920\n But I come to appreciate more the advice\n\n2:23:01.920 --> 2:23:03.860\n that folks like Tim Ferriss have of like,\n\n2:23:03.860 --> 2:23:06.580\n I think it's him, like five cents emails,\n\n2:23:06.580 --> 2:23:10.980\n you know, like a subject that gets to the point\n\n2:23:10.980 --> 2:23:11.960\n that tells you what it's about\n\n2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:14.380\n so that like you break through the signal to the noise.\n\n2:23:14.380 --> 2:23:15.660\n But I really appreciate what you're saying\n\n2:23:15.660 --> 2:23:17.660\n because part of the equation for me is like,\n\n2:23:17.660 --> 2:23:18.560\n I have a three year old,\n\n2:23:18.560 --> 2:23:21.700\n and like my time on the ground, on the floor,\n\n2:23:21.700 --> 2:23:25.860\n playing blocks or cars with him is part of that equation.\n\n2:23:25.860 --> 2:23:27.500\n And even if the day is ending\n\n2:23:27.500 --> 2:23:29.220\n and I know some of those emails are slipping by\n\n2:23:29.220 --> 2:23:30.380\n and I'll never get back to them.\n\n2:23:30.380 --> 2:23:32.900\n And I have, I'm struggling with it already.\n\n2:23:32.900 --> 2:23:34.340\n And I get what you're saying is like,\n\n2:23:34.340 --> 2:23:35.860\n I haven't seen anything yet\n\n2:23:35.860 --> 2:23:39.020\n if with the type of exposure that like your podcast gets.\n\n2:23:39.020 --> 2:23:40.380\n This will bring in exposure.\n\n2:23:40.380 --> 2:23:42.380\n And then I think in terms of postdocs,\n\n2:23:42.380 --> 2:23:43.860\n this is a really good podcast\n\n2:23:43.860 --> 2:23:47.540\n in the sense that there's a lot of brilliant PhD students\n\n2:23:47.540 --> 2:23:48.820\n out there that are looking for a poster\n\n2:23:48.820 --> 2:23:52.260\n from all over, from MIT, probably from Hopkins,\n\n2:23:52.260 --> 2:23:53.660\n it's just all over the place.\n\n2:23:53.660 --> 2:23:57.400\n So this is, and I, we have different preferences,\n\n2:23:57.400 --> 2:24:00.420\n but my preference would also be to have like a form\n\n2:24:00.420 --> 2:24:01.940\n that they could fill out for posts.\n\n2:24:01.940 --> 2:24:05.260\n Because, you know, it's very difficult through email\n\n2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:09.020\n to tell who's really going to be a strong collaborator\n\n2:24:09.020 --> 2:24:12.280\n for you, like a strong postdoc, strong student,\n\n2:24:12.280 --> 2:24:15.640\n because you want a bunch of details,\n\n2:24:15.640 --> 2:24:16.480\n but at the same time,\n\n2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:19.520\n you don't want a million pages worth of email.\n\n2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:21.560\n So you want a little bit of application process.\n\n2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:24.840\n So usually you set up a form that helps me indicate\n\n2:24:24.840 --> 2:24:27.440\n how passionate the person is,\n\n2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:32.440\n how willing they are to do hard work.\n\n2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:35.440\n Like I often ask a question,\n\n2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:39.040\n people of what do you think is more important\n\n2:24:39.040 --> 2:24:41.440\n to work hard or to work smart?\n\n2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:45.360\n And I use that, those types of questions\n\n2:24:45.360 --> 2:24:47.440\n to indicate who I would like to work with.\n\n2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:51.520\n Because it's counterintuitive.\n\n2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:56.200\n But anyway, I'll leave that question unanswered\n\n2:24:56.200 --> 2:24:57.800\n for people to figure out themselves.\n\n2:24:57.800 --> 2:25:00.000\n But maybe if you know my love for David Goggins,\n\n2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:01.640\n you will understand.\n\n2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:02.460\n So anyway.\n\n2:25:02.460 --> 2:25:04.840\n Those are good thoughts about the forms and everything.\n\n2:25:04.840 --> 2:25:05.680\n It's difficult.\n\n2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:07.040\n And that's something that evolves.\n\n2:25:07.040 --> 2:25:09.880\n Email is such a messy thing.\n\n2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:14.880\n There's, speaking of Baltimore, Cal Newport,\n\n2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:16.880\n if you know who that is,\n\n2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:19.880\n he wrote a book called Deep Work.\n\n2:25:19.880 --> 2:25:21.320\n He's a computer science professor\n\n2:25:21.320 --> 2:25:23.520\n and he's currently working on a book about email,\n\n2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:25.720\n about all the ways that email is broken.\n\n2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:28.680\n So this is gonna be a fascinating read.\n\n2:25:28.680 --> 2:25:30.600\n This is a little bit of a general question,\n\n2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:35.600\n but almost a bigger picture question\n\n2:25:36.720 --> 2:25:38.120\n that we touched on a little bit,\n\n2:25:38.120 --> 2:25:40.600\n but let's just touch it in a full way,\n\n2:25:40.600 --> 2:25:43.400\n which is what have all the psychedelic studies\n\n2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:48.220\n you've conducted taught you about the human mind,\n\n2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:52.280\n about the human brain and the human mind?\n\n2:25:52.280 --> 2:25:53.360\n Is there something,\n\n2:25:53.360 --> 2:25:56.300\n if you look at the human scientists you were before\n\n2:25:56.300 --> 2:25:59.640\n this work and the scientists you are now,\n\n2:26:00.780 --> 2:26:03.640\n how has your understanding of the human mind changed?\n\n2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:08.360\n I'm thinking of that in two categories.\n\n2:26:08.360 --> 2:26:13.280\n One kind of more scientific,\n\n2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:14.540\n and they're both scientific,\n\n2:26:14.540 --> 2:26:19.540\n but one more about the brain and behavior\n\n2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:22.760\n and the mind, so to speak.\n\n2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:24.080\n And as a behaviorist,\n\n2:26:24.080 --> 2:26:28.000\n all we see sort of the mind as a metaphor for behaviors,\n\n2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:30.900\n but anyway, that gets philosophical.\n\n2:26:30.900 --> 2:26:35.200\n But it's really increasing the,\n\n2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:39.540\n so the one category is increasing the appreciation\n\n2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:43.120\n for the magnitude of depth.\n\n2:26:43.120 --> 2:26:47.400\n I mean, so these are all metaphors of human experience.\n\n2:26:47.400 --> 2:26:48.960\n That might be a good way to,\n\n2:26:48.960 --> 2:26:51.000\n because you use certain words like consciousness\n\n2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.640\n and it's like we're using constructs\n\n2:26:53.640 --> 2:26:56.920\n that aren't well defined unless we kind of dig in,\n\n2:26:56.920 --> 2:27:01.200\n but human experience like that,\n\n2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:03.820\n the experiences on these compounds\n\n2:27:03.820 --> 2:27:07.180\n can be so far out there or so deep.\n\n2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:10.860\n And they're doing that by tinkering\n\n2:27:10.860 --> 2:27:13.160\n with the same machinery that's going on up there.\n\n2:27:13.160 --> 2:27:16.280\n I mean, my assumption,\n\n2:27:16.280 --> 2:27:20.160\n and I think it's a good assumption is that all experiences,\n\n2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:25.160\n there's a biological side to all phenomenal experience.\n\n2:27:25.160 --> 2:27:27.480\n So there is not,\n\n2:27:27.480 --> 2:27:32.480\n the divide between biology and experience or psychology\n\n2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:38.380\n is, it's not one or the other.\n\n2:27:38.380 --> 2:27:43.040\n These are just two sides of the same coin.\n\n2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:45.740\n I mean, you're avoiding the use\n\n2:27:45.740 --> 2:27:47.560\n of the word consciousness, for example,\n\n2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:49.060\n but the experience is referring\n\n2:27:49.060 --> 2:27:50.880\n to the subjective experience.\n\n2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:53.200\n So it's the actual technical use\n\n2:27:53.200 --> 2:27:57.760\n of the word consciousness of subjective experience.\n\n2:27:57.760 --> 2:28:00.320\n And even that word, there are certain ways that like,\n\n2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:02.460\n sort of like if we're talking about access consciousness\n\n2:28:02.460 --> 2:28:05.800\n or narrative self awareness, which is an aspect of,\n\n2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:08.280\n like you can wrap a definition around that\n\n2:28:08.280 --> 2:28:09.720\n and we can talk meaningfully about it,\n\n2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:11.160\n but so often around psychedelics,\n\n2:28:11.160 --> 2:28:13.080\n it's used in this much more,\n\n2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:15.400\n in terms of ultimately explaining\n\n2:28:15.400 --> 2:28:17.160\n phenomenal consciousness itself,\n\n2:28:17.160 --> 2:28:18.860\n the so called hard problem,\n\n2:28:18.860 --> 2:28:22.400\n and relating to that question\n\n2:28:22.400 --> 2:28:25.800\n and psychedelics really haven't spoken to that.\n\n2:28:25.800 --> 2:28:27.020\n And that's why it's hard\n\n2:28:27.020 --> 2:28:29.040\n because like it's hard to imagine anything.\n\n2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:32.220\n But I think what I was getting is that psychedelics\n\n2:28:32.220 --> 2:28:34.020\n have done this by,\n\n2:28:34.020 --> 2:28:37.000\n the reason I was getting into the biology versus mind,\n\n2:28:37.000 --> 2:28:41.780\n psychology divide is that just to kind of set up the fact\n\n2:28:41.780 --> 2:28:45.800\n that I think all of our experience is related\n\n2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:49.240\n to these biological events.\n\n2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:52.860\n So whether they be naturally occurring neurotransmitters,\n\n2:28:52.860 --> 2:28:56.420\n like serotonin and dopamine and norepinephrine, et cetera,\n\n2:28:56.420 --> 2:28:59.200\n and a whole other sort of biological activity\n\n2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:01.560\n and kind of another layer up\n\n2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.600\n that we could talk about as network activity,\n\n2:29:03.600 --> 2:29:05.160\n communication amongst brain areas,\n\n2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:06.760\n like this is always going on,\n\n2:29:06.760 --> 2:29:10.600\n even if I just prompt you to think about a loved one,\n\n2:29:10.600 --> 2:29:13.440\n like there's something happening biologically.\n\n2:29:13.440 --> 2:29:15.920\n Okay, so that's always another side of the coin.\n\n2:29:15.920 --> 2:29:18.640\n So another way to put that\n\n2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:21.760\n is all of our subjective experience outside of drugs,\n\n2:29:21.760 --> 2:29:26.760\n it's all a controlled hallucination in a sense.\n\n2:29:27.040 --> 2:29:28.880\n Like this is completely constructed.\n\n2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:33.720\n Our experience of reality is completely a simulation.\n\n2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:36.320\n So I think we're on solid ground to say\n\n2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:37.400\n that that's our best guess\n\n2:29:37.400 --> 2:29:41.000\n and that's a pretty reasonable thing to say scientifically.\n\n2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:43.480\n Like all the rich complexity of the world emerges\n\n2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:46.000\n from just some biology and some chemicals.\n\n2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:49.680\n So in that definition implied a causation, it comes from.\n\n2:29:49.680 --> 2:29:53.900\n And so we know at least there's a solid correlation there.\n\n2:29:53.900 --> 2:29:57.280\n And so then we delve deep into the philosophy\n\n2:29:57.280 --> 2:30:00.400\n of like idealism or materialism and things like this,\n\n2:30:00.400 --> 2:30:01.520\n which I'm not an expert in,\n\n2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:03.920\n but I know we're getting into that territory.\n\n2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:06.920\n You don't even necessarily have to go there.\n\n2:30:06.920 --> 2:30:09.240\n Like you at least go to the level of like,\n\n2:30:09.240 --> 2:30:11.320\n okay, we know there seems to be this one on one\n\n2:30:11.320 --> 2:30:14.800\n correspondence and that seems pretty solid.\n\n2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:16.640\n Like you can't prove a negative and you can't prove,\n\n2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:18.920\n you know, it's in that category of like,\n\n2:30:18.920 --> 2:30:20.480\n you could come up with an experience\n\n2:30:20.480 --> 2:30:22.560\n that maybe doesn't have a biological correlate,\n\n2:30:22.560 --> 2:30:24.480\n but then you're talking about,\n\n2:30:24.480 --> 2:30:25.800\n there's also the limits of the science.\n\n2:30:25.800 --> 2:30:26.800\n Is it a false negative?\n\n2:30:26.800 --> 2:30:29.600\n But I think our best guess and a very decent assumption\n\n2:30:29.600 --> 2:30:33.680\n is that every psychological event has a biological correlate.\n\n2:30:33.680 --> 2:30:37.880\n So with that said, you know, the idea that you can throw,\n\n2:30:37.880 --> 2:30:42.160\n alter that biology in a pretty trivial manner.\n\n2:30:42.160 --> 2:30:45.320\n I mean, you could take like a relatively small number\n\n2:30:45.320 --> 2:30:48.880\n of these molecules, throw them into the nervous system\n\n2:30:48.880 --> 2:30:53.060\n and then have a 60 year old person who has,\n\n2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:59.220\n you name it, I mean, that has hiked to the top of Everest\n\n2:30:59.220 --> 2:31:02.640\n and that speaks five languages and that has been married\n\n2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:06.080\n and has kids and grandkids and has,\n\n2:31:06.080 --> 2:31:09.020\n you name it, you know, like been at the top and say,\n\n2:31:09.020 --> 2:31:12.800\n this fundamentally changed who I am as a person\n\n2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:16.020\n and what I think life is about.\n\n2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:20.920\n Like that's the thing about psychedelics\n\n2:31:20.920 --> 2:31:24.600\n that just floors me and it never fails.\n\n2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:27.960\n I mean, sometimes you get bogged down by the paperwork\n\n2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:30.120\n and running studies and all the, I don't know,\n\n2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:33.240\n all of the BS that can come with being in academia\n\n2:31:33.240 --> 2:31:34.640\n and everything and then you,\n\n2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:37.280\n and sometimes you get some dud sessions\n\n2:31:37.280 --> 2:31:39.920\n where it's not the full, all the magic isn't happening\n\n2:31:39.920 --> 2:31:42.720\n and it's, you know, more or less it's either a dud\n\n2:31:42.720 --> 2:31:44.880\n or somewhere and I don't mean to dismiss them,\n\n2:31:44.880 --> 2:31:46.960\n but you know, it's not like these magnificent\n\n2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:50.640\n sort of reports, but sometimes you get the full Monty report\n\n2:31:50.640 --> 2:31:52.640\n from one of these people and you're like,\n\n2:31:52.640 --> 2:31:54.420\n oh yeah, that's why we're doing this.\n\n2:31:54.420 --> 2:31:56.480\n Whether it's like therapeutically\n\n2:31:56.480 --> 2:32:01.480\n or just to understand the mind and you're like,\n\n2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:05.760\n and you're still floored, like how is that possible?\n\n2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:10.760\n How did we slightly alter serotonergic neurotransmission\n\n2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:13.640\n and say, and this person is now saying\n\n2:32:13.640 --> 2:32:16.600\n that they're making fundamental differences\n\n2:32:16.600 --> 2:32:19.800\n in the priorities of their life after 60 years.\n\n2:32:19.800 --> 2:32:24.800\n It also just fills you with awe of the possibility\n\n2:32:25.960 --> 2:32:28.560\n of experiences we're yet to have uncovered.\n\n2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:32.240\n If just a few chemicals can change so much,\n\n2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:36.600\n it's like, man, what if this could be up?\n\n2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.680\n I mean, like how, cause we're just like took a little,\n\n2:32:40.680 --> 2:32:43.240\n it's like lighting a match or something in the darkness\n\n2:32:43.240 --> 2:32:44.960\n and you could see there's a lot more there,\n\n2:32:44.960 --> 2:32:47.640\n but you don't know how much more.\n\n2:32:47.640 --> 2:32:49.120\n And that's.\n\n2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:51.960\n And then like, where's that gonna go with like,\n\n2:32:51.960 --> 2:32:53.640\n I mean, I'm always like aware of the fact\n\n2:32:53.640 --> 2:32:55.800\n that like we always as humans and as scientists\n\n2:32:55.800 --> 2:32:58.040\n think that we figured out 99%\n\n2:32:58.040 --> 2:32:59.400\n and we're working on that first 1%.\n\n2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:01.480\n And we gotta keep reminding ourselves, it's hard to do.\n\n2:33:01.480 --> 2:33:05.800\n Like we figured out like not even 1%, like we know nothing.\n\n2:33:05.800 --> 2:33:09.640\n And so like, I can speculate and I might sound like a fool,\n\n2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:12.080\n but like what are drugs, even the concept of drugs,\n\n2:33:12.080 --> 2:33:15.640\n like 10 years, 50 years, 100 years, 1,000 years,\n\n2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:20.640\n if we're surviving, like molecules that go\n\n2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:23.440\n to a specific area of the brain\n\n2:33:23.440 --> 2:33:25.160\n in combination with technology,\n\n2:33:25.160 --> 2:33:27.760\n in combination with the magnetic stimulation,\n\n2:33:27.760 --> 2:33:31.520\n in combination with the, like targeted pharmacology\n\n2:33:31.520 --> 2:33:35.120\n of like, oh, like this subset of serotonin 2A receptors\n\n2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:39.440\n in the claustrum, at this time, in this particular sequence\n\n2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:41.320\n in combination with this other thing,\n\n2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:44.440\n like this baseball cap you wear that like has,\n\n2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:47.760\n has one of the, is doing some of these things\n\n2:33:47.760 --> 2:33:49.160\n that we can only do with these like giant\n\n2:33:49.160 --> 2:33:50.480\n like pieces of equipment now,\n\n2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:53.280\n like where it's gonna go is gonna be endless.\n\n2:33:53.280 --> 2:33:56.880\n And it becomes easy to combine within virtual reality\n\n2:33:56.880 --> 2:33:58.240\n where the virtual reality is gonna move\n\n2:33:58.240 --> 2:34:01.600\n from being something out here to being more in there.\n\n2:34:01.600 --> 2:34:04.160\n And then we're getting, like we talked about before,\n\n2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:06.720\n we're already in a virtual reality\n\n2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:11.160\n in terms of human perception and cognition models\n\n2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:14.160\n of the universe being all representations\n\n2:34:14.160 --> 2:34:18.520\n and sort of color not existing and just our representations\n\n2:34:18.520 --> 2:34:22.560\n of EM wavelengths, et cetera, sound,\n\n2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:23.920\n being vibrations and all of this.\n\n2:34:23.920 --> 2:34:28.400\n And so as the external VR and the internal VR\n\n2:34:28.400 --> 2:34:30.320\n come closer to each other,\n\n2:34:30.320 --> 2:34:31.400\n like this is what I think about\n\n2:34:31.400 --> 2:34:33.080\n in terms of the future of drugs.\n\n2:34:33.080 --> 2:34:35.720\n Like all of this stuff sort of combines\n\n2:34:35.720 --> 2:34:40.720\n and like where that goes is just, it's unthinkable.\n\n2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:44.520\n Like we were probably gonna, you know,\n\n2:34:44.520 --> 2:34:46.760\n again, I might sound like a fool and this may not happen,\n\n2:34:46.760 --> 2:34:49.280\n but I think it's possible, you know,\n\n2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:50.880\n to go completely offline,\n\n2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:54.120\n like where most of people's experiences maybe\n\n2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:58.880\n going into these internal worlds.\n\n2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:02.480\n And I mean, maybe you through some,\n\n2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:03.880\n through a combination of these techniques,\n\n2:35:03.880 --> 2:35:04.880\n you create experiences\n\n2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:07.560\n where someone could live a thousand years\n\n2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:09.720\n in terms of maybe they're living a regular lifespan,\n\n2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:11.240\n but in over the next two seconds,\n\n2:35:11.240 --> 2:35:13.400\n you're living a thousand years worth of experience.\n\n2:35:13.400 --> 2:35:15.120\n Inside your mind.\n\n2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:16.680\n Yeah, through this manipulation of them.\n\n2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:19.480\n Like, is that possible?\n\n2:35:19.480 --> 2:35:23.000\n Like just based on like first principles and like.\n\n2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:24.920\n Yeah, first principles, yes.\n\n2:35:24.920 --> 2:35:26.120\n I think so.\n\n2:35:26.120 --> 2:35:30.320\n Like give us another 50, 100, 500, like who knows,\n\n2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:33.240\n but like how could it not go there?\n\n2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:37.000\n In a small tangent, what are your thoughts\n\n2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.440\n in this broader definition of drugs,\n\n2:35:39.440 --> 2:35:42.240\n of psychedelics, of mind altering things?\n\n2:35:42.240 --> 2:35:44.320\n What are your thoughts about Neuralink\n\n2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:47.160\n and brain computer interfaces,\n\n2:35:47.160 --> 2:35:52.160\n sort of being able to electrically stimulate\n\n2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:57.680\n and read neuronal activity in the brain\n\n2:35:57.680 --> 2:35:59.880\n and then connect that to the computer,\n\n2:35:59.880 --> 2:36:04.880\n which is another way from a computational perspective\n\n2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:06.680\n for me is kind of appealing,\n\n2:36:06.680 --> 2:36:11.680\n but it's another way of altering subtly\n\n2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.840\n the behavior of the brain.\n\n2:36:13.840 --> 2:36:17.320\n That's kind of, if you zoom out, reminiscent\n\n2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:20.400\n of the way psychedelics do as well.\n\n2:36:20.400 --> 2:36:22.480\n So what do you have?\n\n2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:25.240\n Like what are your thoughts about Neuralink?\n\n2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:27.400\n What are your hopes as a researcher\n\n2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:32.400\n of mind altering devices, systems, chemicals?\n\n2:36:33.680 --> 2:36:36.120\n I guess broadly speaking, I'm all for it.\n\n2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:38.440\n I mean, for the same reason I am with psychedelics,\n\n2:36:38.440 --> 2:36:40.480\n but it comes with all the caveats.\n\n2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:42.760\n You know, you're going into a brave new world\n\n2:36:42.760 --> 2:36:44.360\n where it's like all of a sudden\n\n2:36:44.360 --> 2:36:46.120\n there's going to be a dark side.\n\n2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:51.040\n There's going to be serious ethical considerations,\n\n2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:54.720\n but that should not stop us from moving there.\n\n2:36:54.720 --> 2:36:57.240\n I mean, particularly the stuff from, and I'm no expert,\n\n2:36:57.240 --> 2:37:00.280\n but on the short list in the short term, it's like, yeah,\n\n2:37:00.280 --> 2:37:02.520\n can we help these serious neurological disorders?\n\n2:37:02.520 --> 2:37:03.480\n Like, hell yeah.\n\n2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:07.160\n And I'm also sensitive to something being someone\n\n2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:13.440\n that has lots of neuroscience colleagues with some\n\n2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:16.080\n of this stuff, and I can't talk about particulars,\n\n2:37:16.080 --> 2:37:20.720\n I'm not recalling, but in terms of stuff getting out there\n\n2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.520\n and then kind of a mocking of, oh gosh,\n\n2:37:25.520 --> 2:37:27.800\n they're saying this is unique, we know this,\n\n2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:31.120\n or sort of like this belittling of like, oh,\n\n2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:33.080\n this sounds like it's just a, I don't know,\n\n2:37:33.080 --> 2:37:35.960\n a commercialization or like an oversimplification.\n\n2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:38.680\n I forget what the example was, but something like,\n\n2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:41.080\n something that came off to some of my neuroscientific\n\n2:37:41.080 --> 2:37:42.840\n colleagues as an oversimplification,\n\n2:37:42.840 --> 2:37:44.600\n or at least the way they said it.\n\n2:37:44.600 --> 2:37:46.360\n Oh, from a Neuralink perspective.\n\n2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:49.240\n Right, oh, we've known that for years and like,\n\n2:37:49.240 --> 2:37:52.040\n but I'm very sympathetic to like,\n\n2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:54.080\n maybe it's because of my very limited,\n\n2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:57.920\n but relatively speaking, the amount of exposure\n\n2:37:57.920 --> 2:38:00.480\n the psychedelic work has had to my limited experience\n\n2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:02.840\n of being out there, and then you think about someone\n\n2:38:02.840 --> 2:38:06.480\n like Mike Musk, who's like really, really out there,\n\n2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:10.120\n and you just get all these arrows that like,\n\n2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:13.080\n and it's hard to be like when you're plowing new ground,\n\n2:38:13.920 --> 2:38:16.400\n like you're gonna get, you're gonna get criticized\n\n2:38:16.400 --> 2:38:18.040\n like every little word that you,\n\n2:38:18.040 --> 2:38:20.120\n this balance between speaking to like people\n\n2:38:20.120 --> 2:38:21.520\n to make it meaningful, something scientists\n\n2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:23.840\n aren't very good at, having people understand\n\n2:38:23.840 --> 2:38:25.920\n what you're saying, and then being belittled\n\n2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:30.080\n by oversimplifying something in terms of the public message.\n\n2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:33.120\n So I'm extremely sympathetic, and I'm a big fan\n\n2:38:33.120 --> 2:38:35.520\n of like what that, you know, what Elon Musk does,\n\n2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:39.000\n like tunnels through the ground, and SpaceX,\n\n2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:40.520\n and all this, just like, hell yeah,\n\n2:38:40.520 --> 2:38:43.800\n like this guy has some, he has some great ideas.\n\n2:38:43.800 --> 2:38:45.120\n And there's something to be said,\n\n2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:47.360\n it's not just the communication to the public.\n\n2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:50.200\n I think his first principles thinking,\n\n2:38:50.200 --> 2:38:51.480\n it's like, because I get this\n\n2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:52.960\n in the artificial intelligence world,\n\n2:38:52.960 --> 2:38:55.240\n it's probably similar to neuroscience world,\n\n2:38:55.240 --> 2:38:57.320\n where Elon will say something like,\n\n2:38:57.320 --> 2:39:00.640\n or I worked at MIT, I worked on autonomous vehicles.\n\n2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:05.120\n And he's sort of, I could sense how much he pisses off\n\n2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:08.920\n like every roboticist at MIT, and everybody who works\n\n2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:11.920\n on like the human factor side of safety\n\n2:39:11.920 --> 2:39:14.720\n of autonomous vehicles, and saying like,\n\n2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:18.040\n nah, we don't need to consider human beings in the car,\n\n2:39:18.040 --> 2:39:21.360\n like the car will drive itself, it's obvious\n\n2:39:21.360 --> 2:39:22.880\n that neural networks is all you need.\n\n2:39:22.880 --> 2:39:25.480\n Like it's obvious that like we should be able\n\n2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:30.200\n to systems that should be able to learn constantly.\n\n2:39:30.200 --> 2:39:32.040\n And they don't really need LIDAR,\n\n2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:36.440\n they just need cameras, because we humans just use our eyes,\n\n2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:38.200\n and that's the same as cameras.\n\n2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:41.000\n So like it doesn't, why would we need anything else?\n\n2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:42.840\n You just have to make a system that learns faster,\n\n2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:46.400\n and faster, and faster, and neural networks can do that.\n\n2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:48.840\n And so that's pissing off every single community.\n\n2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:50.560\n It's pissing off human factors community,\n\n2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:53.240\n saying you don't need to consider the human driver\n\n2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:56.040\n in the picture, you can just focus on the robotics problem.\n\n2:39:56.040 --> 2:39:59.400\n It's pissing off every robotics person\n\n2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:02.640\n for saying LIDAR can be just ignored, it can be camera.\n\n2:40:02.640 --> 2:40:06.280\n Every robotics person knows that camera is really noisy,\n\n2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:08.160\n that it's really difficult to deal with.\n\n2:40:08.160 --> 2:40:13.160\n But he's, and then every AI person who says,\n\n2:40:13.240 --> 2:40:16.600\n who hears neural networks, and says like,\n\n2:40:16.600 --> 2:40:18.520\n neural networks can learn everything,\n\n2:40:18.520 --> 2:40:20.480\n like almost presuming that it's kind of going\n\n2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:22.160\n to achieve general intelligence.\n\n2:40:22.160 --> 2:40:26.840\n The problem with all those haters in the three communities\n\n2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:31.040\n is that they're looking one year ahead, five years ahead.\n\n2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:34.400\n The hilarious thing about the, quote unquote,\n\n2:40:34.400 --> 2:40:36.840\n ridiculous things that Elon Musk is saying,\n\n2:40:36.840 --> 2:40:40.320\n is they have a pretty good shot at being true in 20 years.\n\n2:40:40.320 --> 2:40:42.960\n And so like, when you just look at the, you know,\n\n2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:45.640\n when you look at the progression\n\n2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:47.800\n of these kinds of predictions,\n\n2:40:47.800 --> 2:40:51.160\n and sometimes first principles thinking can allow you\n\n2:40:51.160 --> 2:40:55.080\n to do that, is you see that it's kind of obvious\n\n2:40:55.080 --> 2:40:58.120\n that things are going to progress this way.\n\n2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:01.000\n And if you just remove the prejudice you hold\n\n2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:04.560\n about the particular battles\n\n2:41:04.560 --> 2:41:06.520\n of the current academic environment,\n\n2:41:07.440 --> 2:41:08.920\n and just look at the big picture,\n\n2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:10.800\n the progression of the technology,\n\n2:41:10.800 --> 2:41:15.680\n you can usually see the world in the same kind of way.\n\n2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:18.640\n And so in that same way, looking at psychedelics,\n\n2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:22.440\n you can see like, there is so many exciting possibilities\n\n2:41:22.440 --> 2:41:24.960\n here if we fully engage in the research.\n\n2:41:24.960 --> 2:41:26.800\n Same thing with Neuralink.\n\n2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:30.760\n If we fully engage, so we go from a thousand channels\n\n2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:32.360\n of communication to the brain,\n\n2:41:32.360 --> 2:41:35.680\n to billions of channels of communication to the brain,\n\n2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:38.560\n and we figure out many of the details\n\n2:41:38.560 --> 2:41:42.120\n of how to do that safely with neurosurgery and so on,\n\n2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:45.200\n that the world would just change completely\n\n2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:47.480\n in the same kind of way that Elon is.\n\n2:41:47.480 --> 2:41:49.240\n It's so ridiculous to hear him talk\n\n2:41:49.240 --> 2:41:52.440\n about a symbiotic relationship between AI\n\n2:41:52.440 --> 2:41:55.440\n and the human brain.\n\n2:41:55.440 --> 2:41:57.960\n But it's like, is it though?\n\n2:42:00.520 --> 2:42:01.520\n Is it?\n\n2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:03.560\n Because I can see in 50 years,\n\n2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:05.560\n that's going to be an obvious,\n\n2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:08.280\n like everyone will have, like obviously you have,\n\n2:42:08.280 --> 2:42:11.080\n like why are we typing stuff in the computer?\n\n2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:12.040\n It doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:42:12.040 --> 2:42:13.080\n That's stupid.\n\n2:42:13.080 --> 2:42:16.200\n People used to type on a keyboard with a mouse?\n\n2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:17.040\n What is that?\n\n2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:19.720\n And it seems pretty clear, like we're going to be there.\n\n2:42:19.720 --> 2:42:21.600\n Like, and the only question is like, what's the timeframe?\n\n2:42:21.600 --> 2:42:23.920\n Is that going to be 20 or is it 50 or a hundred?\n\n2:42:23.920 --> 2:42:25.200\n Like, how could we not?\n\n2:42:25.200 --> 2:42:29.160\n And the thing that I guess upsets with Elon and others\n\n2:42:29.160 --> 2:42:31.680\n is the timeline he tends to do.\n\n2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:33.760\n I think a lot of people tend to do that kind of thing.\n\n2:42:33.760 --> 2:42:37.560\n I definitely do it, which is like, it'll be done this year\n\n2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:39.600\n versus like, it'll be done in 10 years.\n\n2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:41.480\n The timeline is a little bit too rushed,\n\n2:42:41.480 --> 2:42:43.120\n but from our leadership perspective,\n\n2:42:43.120 --> 2:42:46.760\n it inspires the engineers to do the best work\n\n2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:49.800\n of their life to really kind of believe,\n\n2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:52.880\n because to do the impossible, you have to first believe it,\n\n2:42:52.880 --> 2:42:55.960\n which is a really important aspect of innovation.\n\n2:42:55.960 --> 2:42:57.760\n And there's the delay discounting aspect\n\n2:42:57.760 --> 2:42:58.760\n I talked about before.\n\n2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:00.440\n It's like saying, oh, this is going to be a thing\n\n2:43:00.440 --> 2:43:01.720\n 20, 50 years from now.\n\n2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:04.160\n It's like, what motivates anybody?\n\n2:43:04.160 --> 2:43:05.320\n And even if you're fudging it\n\n2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:07.000\n or like wishful thinking a little bit,\n\n2:43:07.000 --> 2:43:09.680\n or let's just say airing on one side\n\n2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:12.280\n of the probability distribution,\n\n2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:14.320\n like there's value in saying like, yeah,\n\n2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:17.160\n like there's a chance we could get this done in a year.\n\n2:43:17.160 --> 2:43:18.000\n And you know what?\n\n2:43:18.000 --> 2:43:21.040\n And if you set a goal for a year and you're not successful,\n\n2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:23.120\n hey, you might get it done in three years.\n\n2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:25.480\n Whereas if you had aimed at 20 years,\n\n2:43:25.480 --> 2:43:27.040\n well, you either would have never done it at all,\n\n2:43:27.040 --> 2:43:28.240\n or you would have aimed at 20 years\n\n2:43:28.240 --> 2:43:29.960\n and then it would have taken you 10.\n\n2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:32.760\n So the other thing I think about this,\n\n2:43:32.760 --> 2:43:34.320\n like in terms of his work\n\n2:43:34.320 --> 2:43:36.600\n and I guess we've seen with psychedelics,\n\n2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:39.200\n it's like there's a lack of appreciation\n\n2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:40.680\n for like sort of the variability\n\n2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:42.480\n you need a natural selection,\n\n2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:45.320\n sort of extrapolating from biological,\n\n2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:47.360\n from evolution like,\n\n2:43:47.360 --> 2:43:50.960\n hey, maybe he's wrong about focusing only on the cameras\n\n2:43:50.960 --> 2:43:52.440\n and not these other things.\n\n2:43:52.440 --> 2:43:53.720\n Be empirically driven.\n\n2:43:53.720 --> 2:43:56.560\n It's like, yeah, you need to like when he's,\n\n2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:57.720\n when you need to get the regulation,\n\n2:43:57.720 --> 2:43:59.040\n is it safe enough to get this thing on the road?\n\n2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:01.240\n Those are real questions and be empirically driven.\n\n2:44:01.240 --> 2:44:04.720\n And if he can meet the whatever standard is relevant,\n\n2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:06.520\n that's the standard and be driven by that.\n\n2:44:06.520 --> 2:44:07.880\n So don't let it affect your ethics.\n\n2:44:07.880 --> 2:44:10.800\n But if he's on the wrong path,\n\n2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:12.680\n how wonderful someone's exploring that wrong path.\n\n2:44:12.680 --> 2:44:13.960\n He's gonna figure out it's a wrong path.\n\n2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:15.840\n And like other people, he's,\n\n2:44:15.840 --> 2:44:17.760\n damn it, he's doing something.\n\n2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:22.760\n Like he's, and appreciating that variability,\n\n2:44:24.400 --> 2:44:27.280\n that like it's valuable even if he's not on,\n\n2:44:27.280 --> 2:44:29.760\n I mean, this is all over the place in science.\n\n2:44:29.760 --> 2:44:30.960\n It's like a good theory.\n\n2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:32.920\n One standard definition\n\n2:44:32.920 --> 2:44:35.400\n is that it generates testable hypotheses.\n\n2:44:35.400 --> 2:44:37.640\n And like the ultimate model\n\n2:44:37.640 --> 2:44:39.200\n is never gonna be the same as reality.\n\n2:44:39.200 --> 2:44:42.240\n Some models are gonna work better than others.\n\n2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:46.200\n Newtonian physics got us a long ways,\n\n2:44:46.200 --> 2:44:49.600\n even if there was a better model like waiting.\n\n2:44:49.600 --> 2:44:52.280\n And some models weren't as good as,\n\n2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:53.480\n were never that successful,\n\n2:44:53.480 --> 2:44:56.440\n but just even like putting them out there and test it.\n\n2:44:56.440 --> 2:44:58.640\n We wouldn't know something is a bad model\n\n2:44:58.640 --> 2:45:00.400\n until someone puts it out anyway, so.\n\n2:45:00.400 --> 2:45:04.320\n Yeah, diversity of ideas is essential for progress, yeah.\n\n2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:07.760\n So we brought up consciousness a few times.\n\n2:45:07.760 --> 2:45:11.240\n There's several things I wanna kind of disentangle there.\n\n2:45:11.240 --> 2:45:13.240\n So one, you've recently wrote a paper titled\n\n2:45:13.240 --> 2:45:16.000\n Consciousness, Religion, and Gurus,\n\n2:45:16.000 --> 2:45:18.120\n Pitfalls of Psychedelic Medicine.\n\n2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:20.480\n So that's one side of it.\n\n2:45:20.480 --> 2:45:21.680\n You've kind of already mentioned\n\n2:45:21.680 --> 2:45:24.520\n that these terms can be a little bit misused\n\n2:45:24.520 --> 2:45:28.920\n or used in a variety of ways\n\n2:45:28.920 --> 2:45:32.440\n that they can be confusing.\n\n2:45:32.440 --> 2:45:34.520\n But in a specific way,\n\n2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:39.120\n as much as we can be specific about these things,\n\n2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:41.600\n about the actual heart problem of consciousness\n\n2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:44.280\n or understanding what is consciousness,\n\n2:45:44.280 --> 2:45:46.760\n this weird thing that it feels like,\n\n2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:49.600\n it feels like something to experience things.\n\n2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:55.680\n Have psychedelics given you some kind of insight\n\n2:45:55.680 --> 2:45:58.200\n on what is consciousness?\n\n2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:01.080\n You've mentioned that it feels like psychedelics\n\n2:46:01.080 --> 2:46:05.840\n allows you to kind of dismantle your sense of self,\n\n2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:09.160\n like step outside of yourself.\n\n2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:13.560\n So that feels like somehow playing\n\n2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:15.880\n with this mechanism of consciousness.\n\n2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:17.920\n And if it is in fact playing\n\n2:46:17.920 --> 2:46:19.360\n with the mechanism of consciousness\n\n2:46:19.360 --> 2:46:21.440\n using just a few chemicals,\n\n2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:24.120\n it feels like we're very much in the neighborhood\n\n2:46:24.120 --> 2:46:27.720\n of being able to maybe understand\n\n2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:29.960\n the actual biological mechanisms\n\n2:46:29.960 --> 2:46:32.680\n of how consciousness can emerge from the brain.\n\n2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:34.840\n So yeah, there's a bunch there.\n\n2:46:34.840 --> 2:46:39.120\n I think my preface is that I certainly have opinions\n\n2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:42.640\n that I can say, here are my best speculations\n\n2:46:42.640 --> 2:46:47.440\n as just a person and an armchair philosopher.\n\n2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:50.280\n And that philosophy is certainly not my training\n\n2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:52.240\n and my expertise.\n\n2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:53.440\n So I have thoughts there,\n\n2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:55.480\n but that I recognize are completely\n\n2:46:55.480 --> 2:46:57.280\n in the realm of speculation\n\n2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:00.000\n that are like things that I would love to wrap\n\n2:47:00.000 --> 2:47:01.520\n empirical science around,\n\n2:47:01.520 --> 2:47:06.320\n but that there's no data\n\n2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:08.280\n and getting to the hard problem,\n\n2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:09.680\n like no conceivable way,\n\n2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:11.720\n even though I'm very open,\n\n2:47:11.720 --> 2:47:14.560\n like I'm hoping that that problem can be cracked.\n\n2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:16.920\n And as an armchair philosopher,\n\n2:47:16.920 --> 2:47:18.000\n I do think that is a problem.\n\n2:47:18.000 --> 2:47:20.600\n I don't think it can be dismissed as some people argue\n\n2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:22.920\n it's not even really a problem.\n\n2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:25.400\n It strikes me that explaining just the existence\n\n2:47:25.400 --> 2:47:27.440\n of phenomenal consciousness is a problem.\n\n2:47:27.440 --> 2:47:30.440\n So anyway, I very much keep that divide in mind\n\n2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:31.760\n when I talk about these things,\n\n2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:34.120\n what we can really say about what we've learned\n\n2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:35.560\n through science, including by psychedelics\n\n2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:38.480\n versus like what I can speculate on\n\n2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:42.720\n in terms of the nature of reality and consciousness.\n\n2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:47.720\n But in terms of, by and large,\n\n2:47:48.280 --> 2:47:50.840\n skeptically, I have to say psychedelics\n\n2:47:50.840 --> 2:47:53.640\n have not really taught us anything\n\n2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:55.720\n about the nature of consciousness.\n\n2:47:55.720 --> 2:47:57.000\n I'm hopeful that they will.\n\n2:47:57.000 --> 2:48:01.080\n They have been used around certain,\n\n2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:03.000\n I don't even know if features is the right term,\n\n2:48:03.000 --> 2:48:04.840\n but things that are called consciousness.\n\n2:48:04.840 --> 2:48:06.800\n So consciousness can refer to not only\n\n2:48:06.800 --> 2:48:08.280\n just phenomenal consciousness,\n\n2:48:08.280 --> 2:48:11.920\n which is like the source of the hard problem\n\n2:48:11.920 --> 2:48:16.120\n and what it is to be like Nagel's description,\n\n2:48:16.120 --> 2:48:19.240\n but the sense of self,\n\n2:48:19.240 --> 2:48:22.280\n which can be sort of like the experiential self\n\n2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:24.440\n moment to moment, or it can be like the narrative self,\n\n2:48:24.440 --> 2:48:25.920\n the stringing together of stories.\n\n2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:29.120\n So those are things that I think can be,\n\n2:48:29.120 --> 2:48:33.880\n and a little bit's been done with psychedelics\n\n2:48:33.880 --> 2:48:37.360\n regarding that, but I think there's far more potential.\n\n2:48:41.360 --> 2:48:43.200\n So like one story that unfolded\n\n2:48:43.200 --> 2:48:45.960\n is that psychedelics acutely having effects\n\n2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:48.320\n on the default mode network,\n\n2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:50.640\n a certain pattern of activation\n\n2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:52.160\n amongst a subset of brain areas\n\n2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:55.880\n that is associated with self referential processing,\n\n2:48:55.880 --> 2:48:57.240\n seems to be more active,\n\n2:48:57.240 --> 2:49:01.240\n more communication between these areas,\n\n2:49:01.240 --> 2:49:04.000\n like the posterior cingulate cortex\n\n2:49:04.000 --> 2:49:05.960\n and the medial prefrontal cortex, for example,\n\n2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:09.920\n being parts of this and others that are tied\n\n2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:12.280\n with sort of thinking about yourself,\n\n2:49:12.280 --> 2:49:13.560\n remembering yourself in the past,\n\n2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:15.640\n projecting yourself into the future.\n\n2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:18.600\n And so an interesting story emerged\n\n2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:23.600\n when it was found that when psilocybin is on board\n\n2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:25.600\n in the person's system,\n\n2:49:25.600 --> 2:49:29.320\n that there's less communication amongst these areas.\n\n2:49:29.320 --> 2:49:32.160\n So with resting state fMRI imaging,\n\n2:49:32.160 --> 2:49:35.200\n that there's less synchronization\n\n2:49:35.200 --> 2:49:38.160\n or presumably communication between these areas.\n\n2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:41.560\n And so I think it has been overstated\n\n2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:43.120\n in terms of, ah, we see this is like,\n\n2:49:43.120 --> 2:49:45.200\n this is the dissolving of the ego.\n\n2:49:46.240 --> 2:49:48.160\n The story made a whole lot of sense,\n\n2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:50.960\n but there's several,\n\n2:49:50.960 --> 2:49:53.440\n I think that story is really being challenged.\n\n2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:55.800\n Like one, we see increasing number of drugs\n\n2:49:55.800 --> 2:49:59.520\n that decouple that network,\n\n2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:02.640\n including ones like that aren't psychedelic.\n\n2:50:02.640 --> 2:50:04.960\n So this may just be a property, frankly,\n\n2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:07.760\n of being like, you know, screwed up, you know,\n\n2:50:07.760 --> 2:50:09.200\n like, you know, being out of your head,\n\n2:50:09.200 --> 2:50:10.560\n being like, like, you know.\n\n2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:12.400\n Anytime you mess with the perception system,\n\n2:50:12.400 --> 2:50:14.720\n maybe it screws up some,\n\n2:50:14.720 --> 2:50:19.040\n just our ability to just function in the holistically\n\n2:50:19.040 --> 2:50:20.920\n like we do in order,\n\n2:50:20.920 --> 2:50:22.560\n yeah, for the brain to perceive stuff,\n\n2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:24.080\n to be able to map it to memory,\n\n2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:26.320\n to connect things together,\n\n2:50:26.320 --> 2:50:28.120\n the whole recur mechanism\n\n2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:30.360\n that that could just be messed with.\n\n2:50:30.360 --> 2:50:31.200\n Right.\n\n2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:32.160\n And it could, and I'm speculating,\n\n2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:33.080\n it could be tied to more\n\n2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:34.680\n if you had to download into the language,\n\n2:50:34.680 --> 2:50:37.160\n everyday language, like not feeling like yourself.\n\n2:50:37.160 --> 2:50:39.120\n Like, so whether that be like really drunk\n\n2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:42.880\n or really hopped up on amphetamine or, you know,\n\n2:50:42.880 --> 2:50:45.480\n like we found it like decoupling of the default mode network\n\n2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:48.960\n on salvinorin A, which is a smokable psychedelic,\n\n2:50:48.960 --> 2:50:50.960\n which is a non classic psychedelic,\n\n2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:52.760\n but another one where like DMT,\n\n2:50:52.760 --> 2:50:54.960\n where people are often talking to entities\n\n2:50:54.960 --> 2:50:55.800\n and that type of thing.\n\n2:50:55.800 --> 2:50:57.280\n That was a really fun study to run.\n\n2:50:57.280 --> 2:50:58.640\n But nonetheless, most people say\n\n2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:00.280\n it's not a classic psychedelic\n\n2:51:00.280 --> 2:51:04.400\n and doesn't have some of those phenomenal features\n\n2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:06.840\n that people report from classic psychedelics\n\n2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:11.120\n and not sort of the clear sort of ego loss type,\n\n2:51:11.120 --> 2:51:12.920\n at least not in the way that people report it\n\n2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:13.960\n with classic psychedelics.\n\n2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:15.520\n So you get it with all these different drugs.\n\n2:51:15.520 --> 2:51:18.040\n And so, and then you also see just broad,\n\n2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:21.440\n broad changes in network activity with other networks.\n\n2:51:21.440 --> 2:51:25.880\n And so I think that story took off a little too soon,\n\n2:51:25.880 --> 2:51:29.000\n although, so I think, and the story that the DMN,\n\n2:51:29.000 --> 2:51:32.400\n the default mode network relating to the self,\n\n2:51:32.400 --> 2:51:34.800\n and I know some neuroscientists, it drives them crazy\n\n2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:37.920\n if you say that it's the ego and that just like,\n\n2:51:37.920 --> 2:51:42.080\n but self referential processing, if you go that far,\n\n2:51:42.080 --> 2:51:45.120\n like that was already known before psychedelics.\n\n2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:48.880\n Psychedelics didn't really contribute to that.\n\n2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:52.600\n The idea that this type of brain network activity\n\n2:51:52.600 --> 2:51:54.520\n was related to a sense of self.\n\n2:51:56.160 --> 2:52:00.120\n But it is absolutely striking that psychedelics\n\n2:52:00.120 --> 2:52:02.360\n that people report with pretty high reliability,\n\n2:52:02.360 --> 2:52:06.240\n these unity experiences that where people subjectively,\n\n2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:10.240\n like they report losing or again, like the boundaries,\n\n2:52:10.240 --> 2:52:14.960\n however you wanna say it, like these unity experiences,\n\n2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:16.520\n I think we can do a lot with that\n\n2:52:16.520 --> 2:52:19.440\n in terms of figuring out the nature of the sense of self.\n\n2:52:19.440 --> 2:52:23.360\n Now, I don't think that's the same as the hard problem\n\n2:52:23.360 --> 2:52:25.760\n or the existence of phenomenal consciousness,\n\n2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:27.520\n because you can build an AI system,\n\n2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:28.720\n and you correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n2:52:28.720 --> 2:52:31.600\n that will pass a Turing test\n\n2:52:31.600 --> 2:52:34.800\n in terms of demonstrating the qualities\n\n2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:37.240\n of like a sense of self.\n\n2:52:37.240 --> 2:52:38.800\n It will talk as if there's a self\n\n2:52:38.800 --> 2:52:40.720\n and there's probably a certain like algorithm\n\n2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:44.960\n or whatever, like computational,\n\n2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:49.400\n like scaling up of computations that results in somehow,\n\n2:52:49.400 --> 2:52:52.120\n and I think this is the argument with humans,\n\n2:52:52.120 --> 2:52:53.920\n but some have speculated this,\n\n2:52:53.920 --> 2:52:57.600\n why do we have this illusion of the self that's evolved?\n\n2:52:57.600 --> 2:53:01.520\n And we might find this with AI that like it works,\n\n2:53:01.520 --> 2:53:06.280\n having a sense of self, and that's stated incorrectly,\n\n2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:11.280\n like acting as if there is an agent at play\n\n2:53:12.360 --> 2:53:17.000\n and behaviorally acting like there is a self,\n\n2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:18.400\n that might kind of work.\n\n2:53:18.400 --> 2:53:22.400\n And so you can program a computer or a robot\n\n2:53:24.040 --> 2:53:27.360\n to basically demonstrate, have an algorithm like that\n\n2:53:27.360 --> 2:53:28.920\n and demonstrate that type of behavior.\n\n2:53:28.920 --> 2:53:30.960\n And I think that's completely silent\n\n2:53:30.960 --> 2:53:33.840\n on whether there's an actual experience inside there.\n\n2:53:33.840 --> 2:53:36.760\n I've been struggling to find the right words\n\n2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:38.520\n in how I feel about that whole thing,\n\n2:53:38.520 --> 2:53:42.360\n but because I've said it poorly before,\n\n2:53:42.360 --> 2:53:44.360\n I've before said that there's no difference\n\n2:53:44.360 --> 2:53:48.840\n between the appearance and the actual existence\n\n2:53:48.840 --> 2:53:51.560\n of consciousness or intelligence or any of that.\n\n2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:56.560\n What I really mean is the more the appearance\n\n2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:00.720\n starts to look like the thing,\n\n2:54:00.720 --> 2:54:03.400\n the more there's this area where it's like,\n\n2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:08.400\n I don't think, our whole idea of what is real\n\n2:54:10.640 --> 2:54:13.160\n and what is just an illusion\n\n2:54:13.160 --> 2:54:16.760\n is not the right way to think about it.\n\n2:54:16.760 --> 2:54:20.680\n So the whole idea is like, if you create a system\n\n2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:22.920\n that looks like it's having fun,\n\n2:54:22.920 --> 2:54:27.240\n the more it's realistically able to portray itself\n\n2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:31.160\n as having fun, like there's a certain gray area\n\n2:54:31.160 --> 2:54:34.600\n which the system is having fun.\n\n2:54:34.600 --> 2:54:36.640\n And same with intelligence, same with consciousness.\n\n2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:40.000\n And we humans wanna simplify,\n\n2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:42.960\n like it feels like the way we simplify the existence\n\n2:54:42.960 --> 2:54:47.960\n and the illusion of something is missing the whole truth\n\n2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:50.480\n of the nature of reality,\n\n2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:52.600\n which we're not yet able to understand.\n\n2:54:52.600 --> 2:54:55.520\n Like it's the 1%, we only understand 1% currently.\n\n2:54:55.520 --> 2:54:59.160\n So we don't have the right physics to talk about things,\n\n2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:00.960\n we don't have the right science to talk about things.\n\n2:55:00.960 --> 2:55:05.960\n But to me, like the faking it and actually it being true\n\n2:55:07.800 --> 2:55:12.800\n is the difference is much smaller\n\n2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:14.760\n than what humans would like to imagine.\n\n2:55:15.680 --> 2:55:18.480\n That's my intuition, but the philosophers hate that\n\n2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:21.200\n because, and guess what?\n\n2:55:21.200 --> 2:55:23.600\n It's philosophers, what have you actually built?\n\n2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:27.320\n So like to me is that's the difference\n\n2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:28.840\n in philosophy and engineering.\n\n2:55:28.840 --> 2:55:32.920\n It feels like if we push the creation, the engineering,\n\n2:55:32.920 --> 2:55:35.160\n like fake it until you make it all the way,\n\n2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:37.120\n which is like fake consciousness\n\n2:55:37.120 --> 2:55:41.280\n until you realize, holy crap, this thing is conscious.\n\n2:55:41.280 --> 2:55:42.880\n Fake intelligence until you realize,\n\n2:55:42.880 --> 2:55:44.600\n holy crap, this is intelligence.\n\n2:55:44.600 --> 2:55:48.360\n And from my curiosity with psychedelics\n\n2:55:48.360 --> 2:55:52.000\n and just neurobiology and neuroscience\n\n2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:55.680\n is like it feels, I love the armchair.\n\n2:55:55.680 --> 2:55:57.520\n I love sitting in that armchair\n\n2:55:57.520 --> 2:55:59.520\n because it feels like at a certain point\n\n2:55:59.520 --> 2:56:01.880\n you're going to think about this problem\n\n2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:04.120\n and there's going to be an aha moment.\n\n2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:06.760\n Like that's what the armchair does.\n\n2:56:06.760 --> 2:56:09.960\n Sometimes science prevents you from really thinking,\n\n2:56:09.960 --> 2:56:14.360\n wait, like it's really simple.\n\n2:56:14.360 --> 2:56:15.840\n There's something really simple.\n\n2:56:15.840 --> 2:56:20.840\n Like there's some, there could be some dance of chemicals\n\n2:56:20.840 --> 2:56:22.320\n that we're totally unaware of,\n\n2:56:22.320 --> 2:56:26.760\n not from aspects of like which chemicals to combine\n\n2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:29.320\n with which biological architectures,\n\n2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:32.880\n but more like we were thinking of it completely wrong\n\n2:56:33.720 --> 2:56:38.000\n that just out of the blue,\n\n2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:41.920\n like maybe the human mind is just like a radio\n\n2:56:41.920 --> 2:56:44.160\n that tunes into some other medium\n\n2:56:44.160 --> 2:56:46.080\n where consciousness actually exists.\n\n2:56:46.080 --> 2:56:49.640\n Like those weird sort of hypothetically,\n\n2:56:49.640 --> 2:56:52.160\n like maybe we're just thinking about the human mind\n\n2:56:52.160 --> 2:56:53.280\n totally wrong.\n\n2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:56.840\n Maybe there's no such thing as individual intelligence.\n\n2:56:56.840 --> 2:57:00.240\n Maybe it is all collective intelligence between humans.\n\n2:57:00.240 --> 2:57:02.280\n Like maybe the intelligence is possessed\n\n2:57:02.280 --> 2:57:05.520\n in the communication of language between minds.\n\n2:57:05.520 --> 2:57:08.120\n And then in fact, consciousness is a property\n\n2:57:08.120 --> 2:57:13.120\n of that language versus a property of the individual minds.\n\n2:57:13.200 --> 2:57:15.360\n And somehow the neurotransmitters\n\n2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:16.560\n will be able to connect to that.\n\n2:57:16.560 --> 2:57:19.680\n So then AI systems can join\n\n2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:23.600\n that common collective intelligence, that common language,\n\n2:57:23.600 --> 2:57:25.360\n like just thinking completely outside of the box.\n\n2:57:25.360 --> 2:57:26.720\n I just said a bunch of crazy things.\n\n2:57:26.720 --> 2:57:29.800\n I don't know, but thinking outside the box\n\n2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:33.280\n and there's something about subtle manipulation\n\n2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:35.280\n of the chemicals of the brain,\n\n2:57:35.280 --> 2:57:40.280\n which feels like the best or one of the great chances\n\n2:57:40.760 --> 2:57:43.800\n of the scientific process leading us\n\n2:57:43.800 --> 2:57:46.880\n to an actual understanding of the hard problem.\n\n2:57:46.880 --> 2:57:48.880\n So I am very hopeful that,\n\n2:57:48.880 --> 2:57:52.240\n and so I mean, I'm a radical empiricist,\n\n2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:54.160\n which I'm very strong with that.\n\n2:57:54.160 --> 2:57:56.640\n Like that's what, you know,\n\n2:57:56.640 --> 2:57:57.960\n so, you know, science isn't about\n\n2:57:57.960 --> 2:57:59.960\n ultimately being a materialist.\n\n2:57:59.960 --> 2:58:02.720\n It's like, it's about being an empiricist in my view.\n\n2:58:02.720 --> 2:58:04.520\n And so, for example, I'm very fascinated\n\n2:58:04.520 --> 2:58:06.400\n by the so called Psi phenomenon,\n\n2:58:06.400 --> 2:58:08.320\n you know, like stuff that people just kind of reject\n\n2:58:08.320 --> 2:58:09.160\n out of hand.\n\n2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:12.840\n You know, I kind of orient towards that stuff\n\n2:58:12.840 --> 2:58:16.320\n with an idea of, you know, hey, look,\n\n2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:17.360\n you know, what we consider,\n\n2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:19.840\n like anything exists as natural.\n\n2:58:19.840 --> 2:58:23.480\n And so, but the boundary of what we observe in nature,\n\n2:58:23.480 --> 2:58:26.480\n like what we recognize as in nature moves,\n\n2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:28.720\n like what we do today and what we know today\n\n2:58:28.720 --> 2:58:31.280\n would only be described as magic 500 years ago,\n\n2:58:31.280 --> 2:58:32.800\n or even a hundred years ago, some of it.\n\n2:58:32.800 --> 2:58:36.080\n So there will surely be things that,\n\n2:58:36.080 --> 2:58:37.760\n like you explained these phenomenon\n\n2:58:37.760 --> 2:58:39.520\n that just sound like completely,\n\n2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:41.200\n they're supernatural now,\n\n2:58:41.200 --> 2:58:42.960\n where there may be, for some of it,\n\n2:58:42.960 --> 2:58:44.800\n like some of it might turn out to be a complete bunk\n\n2:58:44.800 --> 2:58:47.120\n and some of it might turn out to be,\n\n2:58:47.120 --> 2:58:49.120\n it's just another layer of nature,\n\n2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:50.920\n whether we're talking about multiple dimensions\n\n2:58:50.920 --> 2:58:52.040\n that are invoked or something,\n\n2:58:52.040 --> 2:58:53.640\n we don't even have the language towards.\n\n2:58:53.640 --> 2:58:55.560\n And what you're saying about the moving together\n\n2:58:55.560 --> 2:58:58.840\n of the model and the real thing of conscious,\n\n2:58:58.840 --> 2:59:00.720\n like, I'm very sympathetic to that.\n\n2:59:00.720 --> 2:59:03.240\n So that's that part of like, on the armchair side,\n\n2:59:03.240 --> 2:59:06.160\n where I want to be clear, I can't say this as a scientist,\n\n2:59:06.160 --> 2:59:07.840\n but just in terms of speculating,\n\n2:59:07.840 --> 2:59:11.280\n I find myself attracted to these,\n\n2:59:12.640 --> 2:59:15.760\n more of the sort of the panpsychism ideas.\n\n2:59:15.760 --> 2:59:17.600\n And that kind of makes sense to me.\n\n2:59:17.600 --> 2:59:19.000\n I don't know if that's what you meant there,\n\n2:59:19.000 --> 2:59:20.160\n but it seemed like related,\n\n2:59:20.160 --> 2:59:25.160\n the sense that ultimately if you were completely modeling,\n\n2:59:26.880 --> 2:59:28.960\n like it's like, if you completely modeling,\n\n2:59:28.960 --> 2:59:31.400\n unless you dismiss like the idea\n\n2:59:31.400 --> 2:59:33.080\n that there is a phenomenal consciousness,\n\n2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:33.920\n which I think is hard,\n\n2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:35.760\n given that we all, I seem like I have one,\n\n2:59:35.760 --> 2:59:37.440\n that's really all I know.\n\n2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:41.560\n But if that's so compelling, I can't just dismiss that.\n\n2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:44.920\n Like if you take that as a given,\n\n2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:49.080\n then the only way for the model and the real thing to merge\n\n2:59:49.080 --> 2:59:54.080\n is if there is something baked into the nature of reality,\n\n2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:57.760\n sort of like in the history of like,\n\n2:59:57.760 --> 3:00:00.040\n there are certain just like fundamental forces\n\n3:00:00.040 --> 3:00:03.280\n or fundamental, like, and that's been useful for us.\n\n3:00:03.280 --> 3:00:04.520\n And sometimes we find out\n\n3:00:04.520 --> 3:00:05.680\n that that's pointing towards something else,\n\n3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:09.320\n or sometimes it's still, seems like it's a fundamental,\n\n3:00:09.320 --> 3:00:11.040\n and sometimes it's a placeholder for someone to figure out,\n\n3:00:11.040 --> 3:00:13.120\n but there's something like, this is just a given.\n\n3:00:13.120 --> 3:00:16.200\n This is just, and sometimes something like gravity\n\n3:00:16.200 --> 3:00:17.400\n seems like a very good placeholder,\n\n3:00:17.400 --> 3:00:20.040\n and then there's something better that comes to replace it.\n\n3:00:20.040 --> 3:00:23.200\n So, I kind of think about like consciousness\n\n3:00:23.200 --> 3:00:25.160\n and I didn't, I kind of had this inclination\n\n3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:27.080\n before I knew there was a term for it,\n\n3:00:27.080 --> 3:00:31.960\n Rosalian monism, the idea that, which is a form of,\n\n3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:35.600\n again, I'm an armchair philosopher, not a very good one.\n\n3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:37.120\n Broadly panpsychism, by the way,\n\n3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:40.440\n is the idea that sort of consciousness permeates all matter\n\n3:00:40.440 --> 3:00:44.640\n and, or it's a fundamental part of physics\n\n3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:45.960\n of the universe kind of thing.\n\n3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:49.120\n So, and there's a lot of different flavors of it\n\n3:00:49.120 --> 3:00:51.240\n as you're alluding to.\n\n3:00:51.240 --> 3:00:53.560\n And something that struck me as like consistent\n\n3:00:53.560 --> 3:00:56.560\n with some just, you know, inclinations of mine,\n\n3:00:56.560 --> 3:01:01.560\n just total speculation is this idea of everything we know\n\n3:01:01.560 --> 3:01:06.400\n in science and with most of the stuff we think of physics,\n\n3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:11.400\n you know, really describes, it's all interactions.\n\n3:01:11.640 --> 3:01:13.800\n It's not the thing itself.\n\n3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:18.800\n Like there is something to, and this sounds very new agey,\n\n3:01:20.200 --> 3:01:21.960\n which is why it's very difficult\n\n3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:24.960\n and I have a high bullshit like meter and everything,\n\n3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:27.960\n but like an isness, I mean, think about like Huxley,\n\n3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:30.120\n all this Huxley with his mescaline experience\n\n3:01:30.120 --> 3:01:32.600\n and doors of procession, like there's an isness there\n\n3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:37.600\n in Alan Watson, like there is a nature of being,\n\n3:01:37.640 --> 3:01:39.200\n again, very new agey sounding,\n\n3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:41.760\n but maybe there is something to,\n\n3:01:41.760 --> 3:01:43.280\n and when we say consciousness,\n\n3:01:43.280 --> 3:01:45.160\n we think of like this human experience,\n\n3:01:45.160 --> 3:01:47.440\n but maybe that's just, that's so processed\n\n3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:52.440\n and so, that's so far, so derivative of this kind\n\n3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:54.800\n of basic thing that we wouldn't even recognize\n\n3:01:54.800 --> 3:01:57.480\n the basic thing, but the basic thing might just be,\n\n3:01:57.480 --> 3:02:00.480\n this is not about the interaction between particles.\n\n3:02:00.480 --> 3:02:05.480\n This is what it is like to exist as a particle.\n\n3:02:06.160 --> 3:02:07.600\n And maybe it's not even particles.\n\n3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:09.600\n Maybe it's like space time itself.\n\n3:02:09.600 --> 3:02:11.720\n I mean, again, totally in the speculation area.\n\n3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:14.120\n And something else based on, so it's funny\n\n3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:16.120\n because we don't have this, neither the science\n\n3:02:16.120 --> 3:02:18.520\n nor the proper language to talk about it.\n\n3:02:18.520 --> 3:02:21.080\n All we have is kind of a little intuitions\n\n3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:24.880\n about there might be something in that direction\n\n3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:26.760\n of the darkness to pursue.\n\n3:02:26.760 --> 3:02:31.360\n And in that sense, I find panpsychism interesting\n\n3:02:31.360 --> 3:02:35.440\n in that like, it does feel like there's something\n\n3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:38.000\n fundamental here, that consciousness is,\n\n3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:40.720\n it's not just like, okay, so the flip side,\n\n3:02:40.720 --> 3:02:43.800\n consciousness could be just a very basic\n\n3:02:43.800 --> 3:02:48.520\n and trivial symptom, like a little hack of nature\n\n3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:53.320\n that's useful for like survival of an organism.\n\n3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:55.160\n It's not something fundamental.\n\n3:02:55.160 --> 3:03:00.160\n It's just this very basic, boring chemical thing\n\n3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:03.320\n that somehow has convinced us humans,\n\n3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:06.720\n because we're very human centric, we're very self centric,\n\n3:03:06.720 --> 3:03:08.360\n that this is somehow really important,\n\n3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:10.520\n but it's actually pretty obvious.\n\n3:03:10.520 --> 3:03:13.520\n But, or it could be something really fundamental\n\n3:03:13.520 --> 3:03:15.360\n to the nature of the universe.\n\n3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:18.640\n So both of those are to me pretty compelling.\n\n3:03:18.640 --> 3:03:21.720\n And I think eventually scientifically testable.\n\n3:03:21.720 --> 3:03:24.120\n It is so frustrating that it's hard to design\n\n3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:25.920\n a scientific experiment currently,\n\n3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:29.600\n but I think that's how Nobel Prizes are won,\n\n3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:32.440\n is nobody did it until they do it.\n\n3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:36.720\n The reason I lean towards, and again, armchair spec,\n\n3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:40.760\n if I had to bet like $1,000 on which one of these\n\n3:03:40.760 --> 3:03:44.040\n ultimately be proved, I would lean towards,\n\n3:03:44.040 --> 3:03:47.640\n I'd put my bets on something like panpsychism\n\n3:03:47.640 --> 3:03:51.640\n rather than the emergence of phenomenal consciousness\n\n3:03:51.640 --> 3:03:55.240\n through complexity or computational complexity,\n\n3:03:55.240 --> 3:03:58.760\n because, although certainly if there is\n\n3:03:58.760 --> 3:04:01.240\n some underlying fundamental consciousness,\n\n3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:06.240\n it's clearly being processed in this way through computation\n\n3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:09.640\n in terms of resulting in our experience\n\n3:04:09.640 --> 3:04:11.440\n and the experience presumably of other animals.\n\n3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:14.440\n But the reason I would bet on panpsychism is to me,\n\n3:04:14.440 --> 3:04:19.400\n Occam's razor, in terms of truly the hard problem,\n\n3:04:19.400 --> 3:04:22.360\n at some point you have an inside looking out.\n\n3:04:22.360 --> 3:04:24.440\n And even looking refers to vision and it doesn't,\n\n3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:26.760\n that's just an example, but just,\n\n3:04:26.760 --> 3:04:29.880\n there's an inside experiencing something.\n\n3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:34.760\n At some point of complexity, all of a sudden,\n\n3:04:34.760 --> 3:04:36.440\n you start from this objective universe\n\n3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:38.440\n and all we know about is interactions between things\n\n3:04:38.440 --> 3:04:39.680\n and things happen.\n\n3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:42.200\n And at this certain level of complexity,\n\n3:04:42.200 --> 3:04:44.200\n magically there's an inside.\n\n3:04:45.120 --> 3:04:48.760\n That to me doesn't pass Occam's razor as easily\n\n3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:53.760\n as maybe there is a fundamental property of the universe.\n\n3:04:53.920 --> 3:04:56.640\n There's both subjective and objective.\n\n3:04:56.640 --> 3:04:58.800\n There is both interactions amongst things\n\n3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:02.600\n and there is the thing itself.\n\n3:05:02.600 --> 3:05:03.440\n Yes.\n\n3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:04.260\n But, yeah.\n\n3:05:04.260 --> 3:05:05.600\n So I'm of two minds.\n\n3:05:05.600 --> 3:05:08.000\n I agree with you totally on half my mind.\n\n3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:09.960\n And the other half is I've seen,\n\n3:05:09.960 --> 3:05:12.000\n looking at cellular automata a lot,\n\n3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.680\n which is, it sure does seem that we don't understand\n\n3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:18.200\n anything about complexity.\n\n3:05:18.200 --> 3:05:21.480\n Like the emergence, just the property.\n\n3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:25.920\n In fact, that could be a fundamental property of reality\n\n3:05:25.920 --> 3:05:28.200\n is something within the emergence\n\n3:05:28.200 --> 3:05:30.400\n from simple things interacting,\n\n3:05:30.400 --> 3:05:33.400\n somehow miraculous things happen.\n\n3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:36.080\n And like that, I don't understand that.\n\n3:05:36.080 --> 3:05:38.840\n That could be fundamental.\n\n3:05:38.840 --> 3:05:43.840\n That like something about the layers of abstraction,\n\n3:05:45.120 --> 3:05:46.760\n like layers of reality,\n\n3:05:46.760 --> 3:05:48.760\n like really small things interacting\n\n3:05:48.760 --> 3:05:53.760\n and then on another layer emerges actual complicated behavior\n\n3:05:54.720 --> 3:05:57.080\n even on the underlying thing is super simple.\n\n3:05:57.080 --> 3:06:00.120\n Like that process, we don't really don't understand either.\n\n3:06:00.120 --> 3:06:02.880\n And that could be bigger than any of the things\n\n3:06:02.880 --> 3:06:04.760\n we're talking about.\n\n3:06:04.760 --> 3:06:07.840\n That's the basic force behind everything\n\n3:06:07.840 --> 3:06:09.600\n that's happening in the universe\n\n3:06:09.600 --> 3:06:14.600\n is from simple things, complex phenomena can happen.\n\n3:06:14.600 --> 3:06:16.560\n Phenomena can happen.\n\n3:06:16.560 --> 3:06:19.320\n And the thing that gives me pause\n\n3:06:19.320 --> 3:06:24.320\n is that I'm concerned about a threshold there.\n\n3:06:24.640 --> 3:06:26.200\n Like how is it likely that,\n\n3:06:26.200 --> 3:06:28.800\n now there may be, and there may be some qualitative shift\n\n3:06:28.800 --> 3:06:30.440\n that in the realm of like,\n\n3:06:30.440 --> 3:06:32.840\n we don't even understand complexity yet,\n\n3:06:32.840 --> 3:06:33.680\n like you're saying.\n\n3:06:33.680 --> 3:06:34.800\n Like, so maybe there is,\n\n3:06:34.800 --> 3:06:38.080\n but I do think like if it is a result of the complexity,\n\n3:06:38.080 --> 3:06:41.440\n well, just having helium versus hydrogen\n\n3:06:41.440 --> 3:06:43.000\n is a form of complexity.\n\n3:06:43.000 --> 3:06:45.840\n Having the existence of stars versus clouds of gas\n\n3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:46.680\n is a complexity.\n\n3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:50.600\n The entire universe has been this increasing complexity.\n\n3:06:50.600 --> 3:06:53.280\n And so that kind of brings me back to then the other\n\n3:06:53.280 --> 3:06:54.640\n of like, okay, if there's,\n\n3:06:55.720 --> 3:06:57.880\n if it's about complexity, then we should,\n\n3:06:57.880 --> 3:06:59.840\n then it exists at a certain level\n\n3:06:59.840 --> 3:07:02.560\n in these simple systems like a star\n\n3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:05.520\n or a more complex atom.\n\n3:07:05.520 --> 3:07:06.880\n Hence the panpsychism, that's right.\n\n3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:09.600\n But we humans, the qualitative shift,\n\n3:07:09.600 --> 3:07:13.400\n we might have evolved to appreciate certain kinds\n\n3:07:13.400 --> 3:07:14.400\n of thresholds.\n\n3:07:14.400 --> 3:07:15.360\n Right. Yeah.\n\n3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:18.400\n I do think it's likely that this idea that,\n\n3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:20.120\n whether or not there's an inner experience,\n\n3:07:20.120 --> 3:07:22.320\n which is phenomenal, it's the hard problem,\n\n3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:26.440\n that acting like an agent, like having an algorithm\n\n3:07:26.440 --> 3:07:29.400\n that basically like operates as if there is an agent,\n\n3:07:29.400 --> 3:07:32.840\n that's clearly a thing that I think has worked\n\n3:07:32.840 --> 3:07:37.160\n and that there is a whole lot to figure out there that,\n\n3:07:37.160 --> 3:07:40.280\n and I think psychedelics will be extremely helpful\n\n3:07:40.280 --> 3:07:44.360\n in figuring more out about that because they do seem\n\n3:07:44.360 --> 3:07:48.000\n to a lot of times eliminate that or whatever,\n\n3:07:48.000 --> 3:07:51.560\n radically shift that sense of self.\n\n3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:53.320\n Let me ask the craziest question.\n\n3:07:53.320 --> 3:07:54.920\n Indulge me for a second.\n\n3:07:54.920 --> 3:07:57.480\n I'll, this is a joke.\n\n3:07:57.480 --> 3:07:58.640\n Compared to what we've been talking about?\n\n3:07:58.640 --> 3:07:59.480\n Like, okay.\n\n3:07:59.480 --> 3:08:02.600\n No, all of this is assigned,\n\n3:08:02.600 --> 3:08:05.840\n all of that, despite the caveats about armchair,\n\n3:08:05.840 --> 3:08:08.680\n I think is within the reach of science.\n\n3:08:08.680 --> 3:08:11.000\n Let me ask one that's kind of,\n\n3:08:11.000 --> 3:08:12.240\n also within the reach of science,\n\n3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:15.620\n but as Joe likes to say, it's entirely possible, right?\n\n3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:21.480\n Is it possible that with these DMT trips,\n\n3:08:21.480 --> 3:08:25.080\n when you meet entities, is it possible\n\n3:08:25.080 --> 3:08:29.560\n that these entities are extraterrestrial life forms?\n\n3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:33.200\n Like our understanding of little green men\n\n3:08:33.200 --> 3:08:36.560\n with aliens that show up is totally off.\n\n3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:37.600\n I often think about this,\n\n3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:42.080\n like what would actual extraterrestrial intelligence\n\n3:08:42.080 --> 3:08:43.760\n look like?\n\n3:08:43.760 --> 3:08:47.920\n And my sense is it will look like very different\n\n3:08:47.920 --> 3:08:51.480\n from anything we can even begin to comprehend.\n\n3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:52.840\n And how would it communicate?\n\n3:08:52.840 --> 3:08:53.840\n And how would it communicate?\n\n3:08:53.840 --> 3:08:55.320\n Would it be necessarily spaceships\n\n3:08:55.320 --> 3:08:57.040\n within your civil travel or?\n\n3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:00.000\n Could it be communicating through chemicals,\n\n3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:03.440\n through if there's the panpsychism situation,\n\n3:09:03.440 --> 3:09:05.720\n if there's something, not if.\n\n3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:09.840\n I almost for sure know we don't understand a lot\n\n3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:12.060\n about the function of our mind in connection\n\n3:09:12.060 --> 3:09:16.240\n to the fabric of the physics in the universe.\n\n3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:17.360\n A lot of people seem to think\n\n3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:20.020\n we have theoretical physics pretty figured out.\n\n3:09:20.020 --> 3:09:22.720\n I have my doubts because I'm pretty sure\n\n3:09:22.720 --> 3:09:24.640\n it always feels like we have everything figured out\n\n3:09:24.640 --> 3:09:25.480\n until we don't.\n\n3:09:25.480 --> 3:09:28.640\n Right, I mean, there's no grand unifying theory yet, right?\n\n3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:32.300\n But even then, we could be missing out,\n\n3:09:32.300 --> 3:09:34.160\n like the concept of the universe\n\n3:09:34.160 --> 3:09:36.040\n just can be completely off.\n\n3:09:36.040 --> 3:09:38.700\n Like how many other universes are there?\n\n3:09:38.700 --> 3:09:40.480\n All those kinds of things.\n\n3:09:40.480 --> 3:09:43.480\n I mean, just the basic nature of information,\n\n3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:48.480\n the time, time, all of those things.\n\n3:09:48.560 --> 3:09:51.600\n Yeah, whether that's just like a thing we assign value to\n\n3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:53.700\n or whether it's fundamental or not,\n\n3:09:53.700 --> 3:09:57.400\n that's whole, I could talk to Shankar forever\n\n3:09:57.400 --> 3:09:58.800\n about whether time is emergent\n\n3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:01.120\n or fundamental to the reality.\n\n3:10:01.120 --> 3:10:04.240\n But is it possible that the entities we meet\n\n3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:06.580\n are actual alien life forms?\n\n3:10:06.580 --> 3:10:08.160\n Do you ever think about that?\n\n3:10:08.160 --> 3:10:10.320\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.\n\n3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:13.360\n And I've, to some degree, laid my cards out\n\n3:10:13.360 --> 3:10:16.080\n by identifying as a radical empiricist, you know?\n\n3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:18.600\n And it's like, so the answer, is it possible?\n\n3:10:18.600 --> 3:10:20.440\n And I think, you know, ultimately,\n\n3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:22.240\n if you're a good scientist, you gotta say,\n\n3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:25.760\n now that's at the extremes, it's a like, yes.\n\n3:10:25.760 --> 3:10:26.600\n Yes.\n\n3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:30.040\n It might get more interesting when you're asked to guess\n\n3:10:30.040 --> 3:10:31.280\n about the probability of that.\n\n3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:34.480\n Is that a one in a million, one in a trillion,\n\n3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:38.220\n one in more than the number of atoms\n\n3:10:38.220 --> 3:10:41.000\n in the universe probability?\n\n3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:44.460\n And as an empiricist, it's like, what is a good testable?\n\n3:10:44.460 --> 3:10:47.200\n Like, how would you know the answer to that question?\n\n3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:49.440\n Or how would you be able to validate?\n\n3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:50.280\n I mean.\n\n3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:52.480\n Well, can you get some information that's verifiable,\n\n3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:57.480\n like information about some other planet or some aspect?\n\n3:11:01.720 --> 3:11:03.440\n And gosh, it would be an interesting range,\n\n3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:06.440\n but what range of discovery that we can anticipate\n\n3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:10.080\n we're gonna know within, you know, whatever,\n\n3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:13.400\n a few years, next five, 10, 20 years,\n\n3:11:13.400 --> 3:11:17.000\n and seeing if you can get that information now,\n\n3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:20.160\n and then over time, it might be verified.\n\n3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:23.320\n You know, the type of thing like, you know, part of Einstein's\n\n3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:24.880\n work was ultimately verified,\n\n3:11:24.880 --> 3:11:26.480\n not until decades and decades later,\n\n3:11:26.480 --> 3:11:31.300\n at least certain aspects through empirical observations.\n\n3:11:31.300 --> 3:11:34.600\n But it's also possible that the alien beings\n\n3:11:34.600 --> 3:11:36.520\n have a very different value system\n\n3:11:36.520 --> 3:11:37.720\n and perception of the world,\n\n3:11:37.720 --> 3:11:40.540\n where all of this little capitalistic improvements\n\n3:11:40.540 --> 3:11:42.640\n that we're all after, like predicting,\n\n3:11:42.640 --> 3:11:45.360\n the concept of predicting the future too,\n\n3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:50.200\n is like totally useless to other life forms\n\n3:11:51.180 --> 3:11:56.180\n that perhaps think in a much different way,\n\n3:11:56.520 --> 3:11:58.980\n maybe a more transcendent way, I don't know, but.\n\n3:11:58.980 --> 3:12:00.680\n So they wouldn't even sign the consent form\n\n3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:03.200\n to be a participant in our experiment?\n\n3:12:03.200 --> 3:12:05.880\n They would not, they would not.\n\n3:12:05.880 --> 3:12:07.000\n And they wouldn't even understand\n\n3:12:07.000 --> 3:12:08.280\n the nature of these experiments.\n\n3:12:08.280 --> 3:12:12.080\n I mean, maybe it's purely in the realm\n\n3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:16.800\n of the consciousness thing that we talked about.\n\n3:12:16.800 --> 3:12:20.920\n So communicating in a way that is totally different\n\n3:12:20.920 --> 3:12:23.280\n than the kinds of communication that we think of\n\n3:12:23.280 --> 3:12:24.240\n as on Earth.\n\n3:12:24.240 --> 3:12:27.880\n Like what's the purpose of communication for us?\n\n3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:30.280\n For us humans, the purpose of communication\n\n3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:32.980\n is sharing ideas, it feels like.\n\n3:12:32.980 --> 3:12:37.880\n Like converging, like it's the Dawkins like memes.\n\n3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:41.640\n It's like we're sharing ideas in order to figure out\n\n3:12:41.640 --> 3:12:45.960\n how to collaborate together, to get food into our systems\n\n3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:49.120\n and procreate and then like murder everybody\n\n3:12:49.120 --> 3:12:52.680\n in the neighboring tribe because they'll steal our food.\n\n3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:54.920\n Like we are all about sharing ideas.\n\n3:12:54.920 --> 3:12:59.840\n Maybe it's possible to have another alien life form\n\n3:12:59.840 --> 3:13:02.140\n that's more about sharing experiences.\n\n3:13:03.400 --> 3:13:05.960\n Like it's less about ideas, I don't know.\n\n3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.920\n And maybe that'll be us in a few years.\n\n3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:08.760\n How could it not?\n\n3:13:08.760 --> 3:13:11.520\n Like instead of explaining something laboriously to you,\n\n3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:13.760\n like having people describe the ineffable\n\n3:13:13.760 --> 3:13:17.160\n psychedelic experience, like if we could record that\n\n3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:19.880\n and then get the neural link of 50 years from now,\n\n3:13:19.880 --> 3:13:21.560\n like, oh, just plug this into your...\n\n3:13:21.560 --> 3:13:22.400\n Just transferring the experiences.\n\n3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:24.920\n Yeah, it's like, oh, now you feel what it's like.\n\n3:13:24.920 --> 3:13:27.600\n And like, in one sense, like how could we not go there?\n\n3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:28.640\n And then you get into the realm,\n\n3:13:28.640 --> 3:13:30.100\n especially when you throw time into it,\n\n3:13:30.100 --> 3:13:32.480\n are the aliens us in the future?\n\n3:13:32.480 --> 3:13:35.380\n Or even like a transcendental, temporal,\n\n3:13:35.380 --> 3:13:37.400\n like the us beyond time.\n\n3:13:37.400 --> 3:13:39.240\n Like, I don't know, like you get into this realm\n\n3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:42.720\n and there's a lot of possibilities, yeah.\n\n3:13:42.720 --> 3:13:44.960\n But I think, you know, there's one psychedelic researcher\n\n3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:49.240\n that's who did high dose DMT research in the 90s\n\n3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:50.860\n who speculated that,\n\n3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:54.120\n that there was a lot of alien encounter experiences.\n\n3:13:54.120 --> 3:13:57.480\n Like maybe these are like entities\n\n3:13:57.480 --> 3:13:59.520\n from some other dimension or...\n\n3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:02.160\n He labeled it as speculation, but you know.\n\n3:14:02.160 --> 3:14:03.760\n Do you remember the name?\n\n3:14:03.760 --> 3:14:04.800\n Oh, Rick Strassman.\n\n3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:05.640\n Oh, Rick Strassman.\n\n3:14:05.640 --> 3:14:07.720\n Yeah, yeah, the DMT work.\n\n3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:10.840\n He labeled it as speculation, but you know,\n\n3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:15.840\n I think that, yeah, I think we'd be wise to kind of,\n\n3:14:16.440 --> 3:14:18.180\n you know, it's always that balance\n\n3:14:18.180 --> 3:14:22.780\n between being empirically grounded and skeptical,\n\n3:14:22.780 --> 3:14:24.520\n but also not being, and I think in science,\n\n3:14:24.520 --> 3:14:27.840\n well, often we are too closed,\n\n3:14:27.840 --> 3:14:29.480\n which relates to like, you're talking about Elon,\n\n3:14:29.480 --> 3:14:31.880\n like in academia, it's like often like,\n\n3:14:31.880 --> 3:14:33.260\n I think you're punished for thinking\n\n3:14:33.260 --> 3:14:35.000\n or even talking about 20 years from now\n\n3:14:35.000 --> 3:14:37.480\n because it's just so far removed from your next grant\n\n3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:41.920\n or for your next paper that it's easy pickings\n\n3:14:41.920 --> 3:14:45.280\n and you know, that you're not allowed to speculate, so.\n\n3:14:45.280 --> 3:14:47.200\n I think though, I'm a huge fan of,\n\n3:14:47.200 --> 3:14:52.200\n I think the best way to me at least to practice like science\n\n3:14:52.920 --> 3:14:57.320\n or to practice good engineering is to like do two things\n\n3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:00.440\n and just bounce off, like spend most of the time\n\n3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:03.520\n doing the rigor of the day to day\n\n3:15:03.520 --> 3:15:05.740\n of what can be accomplished now in the engineering space\n\n3:15:05.740 --> 3:15:08.040\n or in the science, like what can actually,\n\n3:15:08.040 --> 3:15:10.600\n what can you construct an experiment around,\n\n3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:14.080\n do like that, the usual rigor of the scientific process,\n\n3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:17.640\n but then every once in a while on a regular basis,\n\n3:15:17.640 --> 3:15:21.960\n to step outside and talk about aliens and consciousness\n\n3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:25.480\n and we just walk along the line of things\n\n3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:28.680\n that are outside the reach of science currently.\n\n3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:33.680\n Free will, the illusion or the perception\n\n3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:37.760\n or the experience of free will of anything,\n\n3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:41.680\n just the entirety of it, being able to travel in time\n\n3:15:41.680 --> 3:15:45.480\n through wormholes, it's like it's really useful to do that,\n\n3:15:45.480 --> 3:15:49.320\n especially as a scientist, like if that's all you do,\n\n3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:53.100\n you go into a land where you're not actually able\n\n3:15:53.100 --> 3:15:56.460\n to think rigorously, there's something at least to me\n\n3:15:56.460 --> 3:15:59.200\n that if you just hop back and forth,\n\n3:15:59.200 --> 3:16:03.440\n you're able to, I think do exactly the kind of injection\n\n3:16:03.440 --> 3:16:06.280\n of out of the box thinking\n\n3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:08.840\n to your regular day to day science\n\n3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:12.080\n that will ultimately lead to breakthroughs.\n\n3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:15.140\n But you have to be the good scientist most of the time.\n\n3:16:15.140 --> 3:16:17.120\n And that's consistent with what I think\n\n3:16:17.120 --> 3:16:19.460\n the great scientists of history,\n\n3:16:19.460 --> 3:16:24.460\n like in most of the history, the greats,\n\n3:16:25.060 --> 3:16:29.480\n the Newtons and Einsteins, I mean, they were,\n\n3:16:29.480 --> 3:16:31.400\n there was less of, and this change I think\n\n3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:33.760\n is time marched on, but less of a separation\n\n3:16:33.760 --> 3:16:34.760\n between those realms.\n\n3:16:34.760 --> 3:16:36.880\n It's like, there's the inclination alpha,\n\n3:16:36.880 --> 3:16:41.800\n it's like, as a scientist, and this is science,\n\n3:16:41.800 --> 3:16:44.160\n this is my work, and then this, it's like my inclination\n\n3:16:44.160 --> 3:16:46.320\n to say, oh, Lex, don't take me too seriously\n\n3:16:46.320 --> 3:16:47.320\n because this is my armchair,\n\n3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:48.480\n I'm not speaking as a scientist,\n\n3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:52.760\n I'm bending over backwards to say, to divide that self,\n\n3:16:52.760 --> 3:16:55.760\n and maybe there's been less of, there's been that evolution\n\n3:16:55.760 --> 3:17:00.240\n and that's, and like the greats didn't see that.\n\n3:17:00.240 --> 3:17:02.160\n I mean, Newton, and you go back in time,\n\n3:17:02.160 --> 3:17:04.560\n and it's like that obviously connects to then religion,\n\n3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:05.900\n especially if that is the predominant world,\n\n3:17:05.900 --> 3:17:10.400\n where Newton, like how much time did he spend\n\n3:17:10.400 --> 3:17:12.760\n trying to decode the Bible and whatnot?\n\n3:17:12.760 --> 3:17:14.400\n Maybe that was a dead end.\n\n3:17:14.400 --> 3:17:17.080\n But it's like, if you really believe in that,\n\n3:17:17.080 --> 3:17:20.240\n in that particular religion, and you're this mastermind,\n\n3:17:20.240 --> 3:17:22.400\n and you're trying to figure things out,\n\n3:17:22.400 --> 3:17:24.640\n it's not like, oh, this is what my job description is\n\n3:17:24.640 --> 3:17:25.700\n and this is what the grant wants.\n\n3:17:25.700 --> 3:17:28.600\n It's like, no, I've got this limited time on the planet,\n\n3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:30.920\n I'm gonna figure out as much stuff as possible.\n\n3:17:30.920 --> 3:17:32.360\n Nothing is off the table\n\n3:17:32.360 --> 3:17:34.560\n and you're just putting it all together.\n\n3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:35.880\n So this is kind of this trajectory\n\n3:17:35.880 --> 3:17:38.960\n is really related to this, the siloing in science.\n\n3:17:38.960 --> 3:17:42.880\n Like, again, related to my like, oh, I'm not a philosopher,\n\n3:17:44.640 --> 3:17:46.040\n whether you consider that a science or not,\n\n3:17:46.040 --> 3:17:47.080\n not empirical science,\n\n3:17:47.080 --> 3:17:49.240\n but like going to these different disciplines,\n\n3:17:49.240 --> 3:17:53.080\n like the greats didn't observe the boundaries,\n\n3:17:53.080 --> 3:17:56.560\n the boundaries didn't exist, they didn't observe them.\n\n3:17:56.560 --> 3:17:59.440\n So speaking of the finiteness\n\n3:17:59.440 --> 3:18:03.520\n of our existence in this world,\n\n3:18:04.760 --> 3:18:09.120\n so on the front of psychedelics and teaching you lessons\n\n3:18:09.120 --> 3:18:11.040\n as a researcher, as a human being,\n\n3:18:12.320 --> 3:18:16.080\n what have you learned about death, about mortality,\n\n3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:18.560\n about the finiteness of our existence?\n\n3:18:18.560 --> 3:18:21.800\n Are you yourself afraid of death?\n\n3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:25.840\n And how has your view, do you ponder it?\n\n3:18:25.840 --> 3:18:28.320\n And has your view of your mortality changed\n\n3:18:28.320 --> 3:18:30.360\n with the research you've done?\n\n3:18:30.360 --> 3:18:34.240\n Yeah, yeah, so I do ponder it and...\n\n3:18:34.240 --> 3:18:35.080\n Are you afraid of death?\n\n3:18:35.080 --> 3:18:37.760\n Probably on a daily basis, I ponder it.\n\n3:18:37.760 --> 3:18:40.120\n I'd have to pick it apart more and say,\n\n3:18:41.080 --> 3:18:46.080\n yeah, I am afraid of dying, like the process of dying.\n\n3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:48.840\n I'm not afraid of being dead.\n\n3:18:48.840 --> 3:18:49.800\n I mean, I'm not afraid of,\n\n3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:51.960\n I think it was Penn Jillette that said,\n\n3:18:51.960 --> 3:18:53.440\n and he may have gotten it from someone else,\n\n3:18:53.440 --> 3:18:58.400\n but I'm not afraid of the year 1862 before I existed.\n\n3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:02.520\n I'm not afraid of the year 2262 after I'm gone.\n\n3:19:02.520 --> 3:19:03.600\n It's gonna be fine.\n\n3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:07.160\n But yeah, dying, I'd be lying\n\n3:19:07.160 --> 3:19:11.000\n if I said I wasn't afraid of dying.\n\n3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:13.840\n And so there's both the process of dying,\n\n3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:15.200\n yeah, it's usually not good.\n\n3:19:15.200 --> 3:19:18.720\n It'd be nice if it was after many, many years\n\n3:19:18.720 --> 3:19:23.520\n and just sort of, I'd rather not die in my sleep.\n\n3:19:23.520 --> 3:19:24.720\n I'd rather kind of be conscious,\n\n3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:26.920\n but sort of just die, fade out with old age maybe.\n\n3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:31.760\n But just being in an accident and horrible diseases,\n\n3:19:31.760 --> 3:19:33.160\n I've seen enough loved ones.\n\n3:19:33.160 --> 3:19:34.360\n It's like, yeah, this is not good.\n\n3:19:34.360 --> 3:19:37.320\n This is enough to be, I'd like to say\n\n3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:40.760\n that I'm peaceful and sort of balanced enough\n\n3:19:40.760 --> 3:19:41.600\n that I'm not concerned at all,\n\n3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:44.360\n but no, like, yeah, I'm afraid of dying.\n\n3:19:44.360 --> 3:19:48.360\n But I'm also concerned about, I think about family.\n\n3:19:48.360 --> 3:19:52.000\n I'm really, I'm afraid or at least concerned\n\n3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:55.600\n about like not being there,\n\n3:19:55.600 --> 3:19:57.720\n like with a three year old, not being there,\n\n3:19:57.720 --> 3:20:01.200\n not being there for him and my wife\n\n3:20:01.200 --> 3:20:03.840\n and my mom the rest of her life.\n\n3:20:03.840 --> 3:20:05.360\n I'm concerned about not,\n\n3:20:05.360 --> 3:20:07.120\n I'm concerned more about like the harm\n\n3:20:07.120 --> 3:20:10.000\n that it would cause if I left prematurely.\n\n3:20:10.000 --> 3:20:11.720\n And then kind of even bigger along the lines\n\n3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:13.440\n of some of the stuff that forward thinking\n\n3:20:13.440 --> 3:20:14.280\n we've been talking about.\n\n3:20:14.280 --> 3:20:17.920\n I think maybe way too much about just like,\n\n3:20:17.920 --> 3:20:19.920\n and I'll never know the answer.\n\n3:20:19.920 --> 3:20:22.280\n So even if I lived to 120,\n\n3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:24.440\n but like, I wanna know as much as I can,\n\n3:20:24.440 --> 3:20:28.680\n but like, how is this gonna work out like as humans?\n\n3:20:28.680 --> 3:20:30.680\n Are we, and a big one, I think is are we gonna,\n\n3:20:30.680 --> 3:20:33.280\n and I don't think unfortunately I'm gonna learn it\n\n3:20:34.280 --> 3:20:37.240\n in my lifetime, even if I live to a ripe old age,\n\n3:20:37.240 --> 3:20:38.800\n but well, I don't know.\n\n3:20:38.800 --> 3:20:39.840\n Is this gonna work out?\n\n3:20:39.840 --> 3:20:41.640\n Like, are we gonna escape the planet?\n\n3:20:41.640 --> 3:20:42.880\n I think that's one of the biggies.\n\n3:20:42.880 --> 3:20:45.200\n Like, are we gonna, like the survival of the speed,\n\n3:20:45.200 --> 3:20:48.560\n like I think the next, like the time we're in now,\n\n3:20:48.560 --> 3:20:51.040\n it's like with the nuclear weapons, with pandemics\n\n3:20:51.040 --> 3:20:54.440\n and with, I mean, we're gonna get to the point\n\n3:20:54.440 --> 3:20:57.520\n where anyone can build a hydrogen bomb.\n\n3:20:57.520 --> 3:21:00.160\n Like, you know, it's like, you just like the,\n\n3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:02.000\n or engineer like the, you know,\n\n3:21:02.000 --> 3:21:03.720\n something that's a million times worse than COVID\n\n3:21:03.720 --> 3:21:04.560\n and then just spread it.\n\n3:21:04.560 --> 3:21:06.960\n It's like, we're getting to this period of,\n\n3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:09.160\n and then not to mention climate change, you know,\n\n3:21:09.160 --> 3:21:10.920\n it's like, although I think that's not,\n\n3:21:10.920 --> 3:21:12.680\n there's probably gonna be surviving humans\n\n3:21:12.680 --> 3:21:15.400\n with that regard, you know, but it could be really bad.\n\n3:21:15.400 --> 3:21:19.120\n But these existential threats, I think the only real\n\n3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:22.080\n guarantee that we're gonna get another, you name it,\n\n3:21:22.080 --> 3:21:26.840\n thousand million, whatever years is like diversity,\n\n3:21:26.840 --> 3:21:31.400\n diversify our portfolio, get off the planet, you know,\n\n3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:33.080\n don't leave this one, hopefully we keep, you know,\n\n3:21:33.080 --> 3:21:36.640\n but like, and I, you know, it's like,\n\n3:21:36.640 --> 3:21:40.600\n either we're gonna get snuffed out like really quickly\n\n3:21:40.600 --> 3:21:44.000\n or we're gonna like, if we reach that point\n\n3:21:44.000 --> 3:21:46.880\n and it's gonna be over the next like 100, 200 years,\n\n3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:51.880\n like we're probably gonna survive like until like,\n\n3:21:51.920 --> 3:21:55.240\n I mean, you know, like our sun, like, and even beyond that,\n\n3:21:55.240 --> 3:21:57.600\n like we're probably gonna be talking about millions\n\n3:21:57.600 --> 3:21:58.640\n and millions of years.\n\n3:21:58.640 --> 3:22:01.840\n It's like, and we're, I don't know,\n\n3:22:01.840 --> 3:22:04.280\n in terms of the planet, 4 billion years into this.\n\n3:22:04.280 --> 3:22:06.160\n And depending on how you count our species, you know,\n\n3:22:06.160 --> 3:22:08.920\n we're, you know, we're millions of years into this.\n\n3:22:08.920 --> 3:22:11.720\n And it's like, this is like the point of the relay race\n\n3:22:11.720 --> 3:22:13.760\n where we can really screw up.\n\n3:22:13.760 --> 3:22:15.280\n So that would make you feel pretty good\n\n3:22:15.280 --> 3:22:19.080\n when you're on your deathbed at 120 years old\n\n3:22:19.080 --> 3:22:21.480\n and there's something hopeful about,\n\n3:22:21.480 --> 3:22:24.800\n there's a colony starting up on Mars and it's like.\n\n3:22:24.800 --> 3:22:27.320\n Yeah, Titan, like whatever, you know, like, yeah,\n\n3:22:27.320 --> 3:22:29.340\n like that we have these colonies out there\n\n3:22:29.340 --> 3:22:33.440\n that would tell me like, yeah, then at least we'd be good\n\n3:22:33.440 --> 3:22:36.860\n until like the, you know, hopefully, probably\n\n3:22:36.860 --> 3:22:40.400\n until the sun goes red giant, you know what I mean?\n\n3:22:40.400 --> 3:22:43.120\n Rather than, oh, like 20 years from now\n\n3:22:43.120 --> 3:22:46.280\n when there's someone with their finger on the nuclear button\n\n3:22:46.280 --> 3:22:50.520\n that just, you know, misperceives, you know, the radar,\n\n3:22:50.520 --> 3:22:54.360\n you know, like the signal they think Russia's attacking,\n\n3:22:54.360 --> 3:22:56.120\n they're really not or China.\n\n3:22:56.120 --> 3:22:58.920\n And like, that's probably how a nuclear accident,\n\n3:22:58.920 --> 3:23:01.500\n war is gonna start rather than, you know,\n\n3:23:01.500 --> 3:23:03.920\n or the, like I said, these other horrible things.\n\n3:23:03.920 --> 3:23:07.760\n Does it not make you sad that you won't be there\n\n3:23:07.760 --> 3:23:10.520\n if we are successful at proliferating\n\n3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:13.680\n throughout the observable universe\n\n3:23:13.680 --> 3:23:17.680\n that you won't be there to experience any of it?\n\n3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:19.080\n Just the ego death, right?\n\n3:23:19.080 --> 3:23:21.800\n It's the death, because you're still gonna die\n\n3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:23.920\n and it's still gonna be over.\n\n3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:28.480\n That's, you know, Ernest Becker and those folks\n\n3:23:28.480 --> 3:23:33.480\n really emphasize the terror of death that if we're honest,\n\n3:23:33.480 --> 3:23:36.040\n we'll discover if we search within ourselves,\n\n3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:38.800\n which is like, this thing is gonna be over.\n\n3:23:38.800 --> 3:23:43.800\n Most of our existence is based on the illusion\n\n3:23:44.720 --> 3:23:47.000\n that it's gonna go forever.\n\n3:23:47.000 --> 3:23:50.400\n And when you sort of realize it's actually gonna be over,\n\n3:23:50.400 --> 3:23:53.220\n like today, like I might murder you\n\n3:23:53.220 --> 3:23:54.820\n at the end of this conversation.\n\n3:23:54.820 --> 3:23:59.820\n And it might be over today, or like on going home,\n\n3:23:59.820 --> 3:24:02.000\n this might be your last day on this earth.\n\n3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:07.000\n And it's, I mean, like pondering that,\n\n3:24:07.400 --> 3:24:11.400\n I suppose one thing to be me,\n\n3:24:11.400 --> 3:24:15.040\n I, if I were to push back, it's interesting,\n\n3:24:16.360 --> 3:24:21.360\n is you actually, I think you see comfort in the sadness\n\n3:24:21.360 --> 3:24:24.560\n of how unfortunate it will be for your family\n\n3:24:24.560 --> 3:24:27.440\n to not have you, because the really,\n\n3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:32.440\n even the deeper, yes, but that's the simple fear.\n\n3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:39.080\n Even the deeper terror is like this thing\n\n3:24:39.080 --> 3:24:41.340\n doesn't last forever.\n\n3:24:41.340 --> 3:24:46.280\n Like I think, I don't know, like it's hard to put\n\n3:24:46.280 --> 3:24:49.080\n the right words to it, but it feels like\n\n3:24:49.080 --> 3:24:54.080\n that's not truly acknowledged by us, by each of us.\n\n3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:57.080\n Yeah, I think this is the, I mean,\n\n3:24:57.080 --> 3:24:59.080\n getting back to the psychedelics in terms of the people\n\n3:24:59.080 --> 3:25:01.880\n and our work with cancer patients who,\n\n3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:03.680\n we had psilocybin sessions to help them,\n\n3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:08.680\n and it did substantially help them, the vast majority,\n\n3:25:08.680 --> 3:25:10.880\n in terms of dealing with these existential issues.\n\n3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:12.280\n And I think, you know, it's something we,\n\n3:25:12.280 --> 3:25:15.080\n I could say that I really feel that I've come along\n\n3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:18.080\n in that both like being with folks who have died\n\n3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:20.880\n that are close to me, and then also that work,\n\n3:25:20.880 --> 3:25:23.080\n I think are the two biggies in sort of,\n\n3:25:23.080 --> 3:25:26.080\n you know, I think I've come along in that,\n\n3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:31.080\n that sort of acceptance of this, like it's not gonna last.\n\n3:25:31.080 --> 3:25:33.080\n And whether at the personal level\n\n3:25:33.080 --> 3:25:35.080\n or even at the species level, like at some point,\n\n3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:37.080\n all the stars are gonna fade out,\n\n3:25:37.080 --> 3:25:38.080\n and it's gonna be the realm of,\n\n3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:40.080\n which is gonna be the vast majority,\n\n3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:41.080\n unless there's a big crunch,\n\n3:25:41.080 --> 3:25:43.080\n which apparently doesn't seem likely.\n\n3:25:43.080 --> 3:25:45.080\n Like most of the universe, there's this blink of an eye\n\n3:25:45.080 --> 3:25:47.080\n that's happening right now that life is even possible,\n\n3:25:47.080 --> 3:25:49.080\n like the era of stars.\n\n3:25:49.080 --> 3:25:52.080\n So it's like, we're gonna fade out at some point.\n\n3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:55.080\n Like, you know, and you know,\n\n3:25:55.080 --> 3:25:58.080\n then we get at this level of consciousness and like, okay,\n\n3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:00.080\n maybe there is life after death.\n\n3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:02.080\n Maybe there's, maybe time's an illusion.\n\n3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:04.080\n Like that part I'm ready for.\n\n3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:06.080\n Like, I'm like, you know, like that,\n\n3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:08.080\n that would be really great.\n\n3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:10.080\n And I'm looking, I'm not afraid of that at all.\n\n3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:12.080\n It's like, even if it's just strange,\n\n3:26:12.080 --> 3:26:14.080\n like if I could push a button to enter that door,\n\n3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:16.080\n I mean, I'm not gonna, you know, die,\n\n3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:18.080\n you know, I can kill myself, but it's like,\n\n3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:20.080\n if I could take a peek at what that reality is\n\n3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:22.080\n or choose at the end of my life,\n\n3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:25.080\n if I could choose of entering into a universe\n\n3:26:25.080 --> 3:26:28.080\n where there is an afterlife of something completely unknown\n\n3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:29.080\n versus one where there's none,\n\n3:26:29.080 --> 3:26:32.080\n I think I'd say, well, let's see what's behind that.\n\n3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:34.080\n That's a true scientist way of thinking.\n\n3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:36.080\n If there's a door, you're excited about opening it\n\n3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:38.080\n and going in.\n\n3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:39.080\n Right.\n\n3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:43.080\n When I am attracted to this idea, like, you know,\n\n3:26:43.080 --> 3:26:45.080\n and I recognize it's easier said than done\n\n3:26:45.080 --> 3:26:47.080\n to say I'm okay with not existing.\n\n3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:50.080\n It's like the real test is like, okay, check me on my deathbed.\n\n3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:52.080\n You know, it's like, oh, I'll be all right.\n\n3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:55.080\n It's a beautiful thing and the humility of surrendering.\n\n3:26:55.080 --> 3:26:58.080\n And I really hope, and I think I'd probably be more likely\n\n3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:01.080\n to be in that realm right now than I would,\n\n3:27:01.080 --> 3:27:05.080\n or check me when I get a terminal cancer diagnosis,\n\n3:27:05.080 --> 3:27:07.080\n and I really hope I'm more in that realm.\n\n3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:10.080\n But I know enough about human nature to know that, like,\n\n3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:12.080\n I can't really speak to that\n\n3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:14.080\n because I haven't been in that situation.\n\n3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:17.080\n And I think there can be a beauty to that\n\n3:27:17.080 --> 3:27:19.080\n and the transcendence of like, yeah,\n\n3:27:19.080 --> 3:27:21.080\n and, you know, it was beautiful,\n\n3:27:21.080 --> 3:27:24.080\n not just despite all that, but because of that,\n\n3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:27.080\n because ultimately there's going to be nothing\n\n3:27:27.080 --> 3:27:28.080\n and because we came from nothing\n\n3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:30.080\n and we dealt with all this shit,\n\n3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:32.080\n the fact that there was still beauty and truth\n\n3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:35.080\n and connection, like, that, you know,\n\n3:27:35.080 --> 3:27:38.080\n like it just, it's a beautiful thing.\n\n3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:40.080\n But I hope I'm in that.\n\n3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:42.080\n It's easy to say that now.\n\n3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:44.080\n Like, yeah.\n\n3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:47.080\n Do you think there's a meaning to this thing\n\n3:27:47.080 --> 3:27:55.080\n we got going on, life, existence on earth to us individuals\n\n3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:58.080\n from a psychedelics researcher perspective\n\n3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:00.080\n or from just a human perspective?\n\n3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:04.080\n Those merged together for me, like, because it's just hard.\n\n3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:07.080\n I've been doing this research for almost 17 years\n\n3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:09.080\n and like, not just the cancer study,\n\n3:28:09.080 --> 3:28:12.080\n but so many times people like,\n\n3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:15.080\n I remember a session in one of our studies,\n\n3:28:15.080 --> 3:28:18.080\n someone who wasn't getting any treatment for anything,\n\n3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:19.080\n but one of our healthy normal studies\n\n3:28:19.080 --> 3:28:23.080\n where he was contemplating the suicide of his son\n\n3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:25.080\n and just these, I mean,\n\n3:28:25.080 --> 3:28:28.080\n just like the most intense human experiences\n\n3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:32.080\n that you can have in the most vulnerable situations.\n\n3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:35.080\n Sometimes like people like, you know,\n\n3:28:35.080 --> 3:28:38.080\n and it's just like, you have to have a,\n\n3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:40.080\n and you just feel lucky to be part of that process\n\n3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:46.080\n that people trust you to let their guards down like that.\n\n3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:47.080\n Like, I don't know, the meaning,\n\n3:28:47.080 --> 3:28:52.080\n I think the meaning of life is to find meaning.\n\n3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:55.080\n And I think, actually, I think I just described it a minute ago.\n\n3:28:55.080 --> 3:28:57.080\n It's like that transcendence of everything.\n\n3:28:57.080 --> 3:29:02.080\n Like, it's the beauty despite the absolute ugliness.\n\n3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:07.080\n It's the, and as a species, and I think more about this,\n\n3:29:07.080 --> 3:29:08.080\n like, I think about this a lot.\n\n3:29:08.080 --> 3:29:15.080\n It's the fact that we are, I mean, we come from filth.\n\n3:29:15.080 --> 3:29:18.080\n I mean, we're, you know, we're animals.\n\n3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:21.080\n We come from, like, we're all descendant\n\n3:29:21.080 --> 3:29:23.080\n from murderers and rapists.\n\n3:29:23.080 --> 3:29:27.080\n Like, we, despite that background,\n\n3:29:27.080 --> 3:29:33.080\n we are capable of the self sacrifice and the connection\n\n3:29:33.080 --> 3:29:37.080\n and figuring things out, you know, science\n\n3:29:37.080 --> 3:29:40.080\n and other forms of truth, you know, seeking,\n\n3:29:40.080 --> 3:29:44.080\n and an artwork, just the beauty of music\n\n3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:45.080\n and other forms of art.\n\n3:29:45.080 --> 3:29:48.080\n It's like the fact that that's possible\n\n3:29:48.080 --> 3:29:51.080\n is the meaning of life.\n\n3:29:51.080 --> 3:29:52.080\n I mean...\n\n3:29:52.080 --> 3:29:54.080\n And ultimately, that feels to be creating\n\n3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:57.080\n more and richer experiences.\n\n3:29:57.080 --> 3:30:03.080\n The, from a Russian perspective, both the dark,\n\n3:30:03.080 --> 3:30:05.080\n you mentioned the cancer diagnosis\n\n3:30:05.080 --> 3:30:11.080\n or losing a child to suicide or all those dark things\n\n3:30:11.080 --> 3:30:14.080\n is still rich experiences.\n\n3:30:14.080 --> 3:30:17.080\n And also the beautiful creations, the art,\n\n3:30:17.080 --> 3:30:20.080\n the music, the science, that's also rich experience.\n\n3:30:20.080 --> 3:30:24.080\n So somehow we're figuring out from just like psychedelics\n\n3:30:24.080 --> 3:30:26.080\n expand our mind to the possibility of experiences.\n\n3:30:26.080 --> 3:30:29.080\n Somehow we're able to figure out different ways\n\n3:30:29.080 --> 3:30:33.080\n as a society to expand the realm of experiences.\n\n3:30:33.080 --> 3:30:35.080\n And from that we gain meaning somehow.\n\n3:30:35.080 --> 3:30:36.080\n Right. And that's part of like this,\n\n3:30:36.080 --> 3:30:38.080\n we're going across different levels here,\n\n3:30:38.080 --> 3:30:40.080\n but like the idea that so called bad trips\n\n3:30:40.080 --> 3:30:42.080\n or challenging experiences are so common\n\n3:30:42.080 --> 3:30:44.080\n in psychedelic experiences, it's like,\n\n3:30:44.080 --> 3:30:46.080\n that's a part of that.\n\n3:30:46.080 --> 3:30:47.080\n Like, yeah, it's tough.\n\n3:30:47.080 --> 3:30:49.080\n And most of the important things in life\n\n3:30:49.080 --> 3:30:51.080\n are really, really tough and scary.\n\n3:30:51.080 --> 3:30:54.080\n And most of the things like the death of a loved one,\n\n3:30:54.080 --> 3:30:57.080\n like the greatest learning experiences\n\n3:30:57.080 --> 3:31:01.080\n and things that make you who you are are the horrors.\n\n3:31:01.080 --> 3:31:03.080\n And it's like, yeah, we try to minimize them.\n\n3:31:03.080 --> 3:31:06.080\n We try to avoid them, but I don't know.\n\n3:31:06.080 --> 3:31:08.080\n I think we all need to get into the mode\n\n3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:09.080\n of like giving ourselves a break,\n\n3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:12.080\n both personally and societally.\n\n3:31:12.080 --> 3:31:14.080\n I mean, I went through like the,\n\n3:31:14.080 --> 3:31:16.080\n I think a lot of people do these days in my twenties,\n\n3:31:16.080 --> 3:31:20.080\n like, oh, the humans are just kind of a disease\n\n3:31:20.080 --> 3:31:22.080\n on the planet.\n\n3:31:22.080 --> 3:31:23.080\n And then in terms of our country,\n\n3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:25.080\n in terms of the United States, it's like,\n\n3:31:25.080 --> 3:31:28.080\n oh, we have all these horrible sins in our past.\n\n3:31:28.080 --> 3:31:30.080\n And it's like, I think about that like the,\n\n3:31:32.080 --> 3:31:34.080\n I think about it like my three year old.\n\n3:31:34.080 --> 3:31:36.080\n It's like, yeah, you can construct a story\n\n3:31:36.080 --> 3:31:38.080\n where this is all just horrible.\n\n3:31:38.080 --> 3:31:40.080\n You can look at that stuff and say,\n\n3:31:40.080 --> 3:31:42.080\n this is all just horror.\n\n3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:47.080\n Like there's no logical answer to our rational answer\n\n3:31:47.080 --> 3:31:48.080\n to say we're not a disease on the planet.\n\n3:31:48.080 --> 3:31:50.080\n From one lens we are.\n\n3:31:50.080 --> 3:31:57.080\n And you could just look at humanity as that,\n\n3:31:57.080 --> 3:31:58.080\n like nothing but this horrible thing.\n\n3:31:58.080 --> 3:32:01.080\n You can look at, and you name the system,\n\n3:32:01.080 --> 3:32:04.080\n modern medicine, Western medicine,\n\n3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:05.080\n the university system.\n\n3:32:05.080 --> 3:32:07.080\n And it's like, you could dismiss everything.\n\n3:32:07.080 --> 3:32:10.080\n So, big pharma, like hopefully these vaccines work.\n\n3:32:10.080 --> 3:32:12.080\n And then like, yeah, I'd like to,\n\n3:32:12.080 --> 3:32:15.080\n I'm kind of glad the big pharma was a part of that.\n\n3:32:15.080 --> 3:32:17.080\n And it's like the United States,\n\n3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:20.080\n you can like point to the horrors,\n\n3:32:20.080 --> 3:32:22.080\n like any other country that's been around a long time\n\n3:32:22.080 --> 3:32:24.080\n that has these legitimate horrors\n\n3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.080\n and kind of dismiss like these beautiful things.\n\n3:32:27.080 --> 3:32:31.080\n Like, yeah, we have this like modifiable constitutional republic\n\n3:32:31.080 --> 3:32:35.080\n that just like I still think is the best thing going.\n\n3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:40.080\n That as a model system of like how humans have to figure out\n\n3:32:40.080 --> 3:32:41.080\n how to work together.\n\n3:32:41.080 --> 3:32:46.080\n It's like, there's no better system that I've come across.\n\n3:32:46.080 --> 3:32:50.080\n Yeah, there's, if we're willing to look for it,\n\n3:32:50.080 --> 3:32:53.080\n there's a beautiful core to a lot of things we've created.\n\n3:32:53.080 --> 3:32:57.080\n Yeah, this country is a great example of that.\n\n3:32:57.080 --> 3:33:00.080\n But most of the human experience has a beauty to it,\n\n3:33:00.080 --> 3:33:01.080\n even the suffering.\n\n3:33:01.080 --> 3:33:02.080\n Right.\n\n3:33:02.080 --> 3:33:06.080\n So, the meaning is choosing to focus on that positivity\n\n3:33:06.080 --> 3:33:07.080\n and not forget it.\n\n3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:08.080\n Beautifully put.\n\n3:33:08.080 --> 3:33:09.080\n Speaking of experiences,\n\n3:33:09.080 --> 3:33:13.080\n this was one of my favorite experiences on this podcast\n\n3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:15.080\n talking to you today, Matthew.\n\n3:33:15.080 --> 3:33:17.080\n I hope we get a chance to talk again.\n\n3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:19.080\n I hope to see you and Joe Rogan.\n\n3:33:19.080 --> 3:33:21.080\n It's a huge honor to talk to you.\n\n3:33:21.080 --> 3:33:23.080\n Can't wait to read your papers.\n\n3:33:23.080 -->

Terrence McKenna.\n\n3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:12.080\n Nature loves courage.\n\n3:34:12.080 --> 3:34:15.080\n You make the commitment and nature will respond\n\n3:34:15.080 --> 3:34:18.080\n to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.\n\n3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:20.080\n Dream the impossible dream\n\n3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:23.080\n and the world will not grind you under.\n\n3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:24.080\n It will lift you up.\n\n3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:26.080\n This is the trick.\n\n3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:28.080\n This is what all these teachers and philosophers\n\n3:34:28.080 --> 3:34:32.080\n who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold.\n\n3:34:32.080 --> 3:34:34.080\n This is what they understood.\n\n3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:37.080\n This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall.\n\n3:34:37.080 --> 3:34:39.080\n This is how magic is done\n\n3:34:39.080 --> 3:34:42.080\n by hurling yourself into the abyss\n\n3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:45.080\n and discovering it's a feather bed.\n\n3:34:45.080 --> 3:35:10.080\n Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
