Glenn Center\n\n00:08.920 --> 00:12.280\n for the Biology of Aging at Harvard Medical School.\n\n00:12.280 --> 00:13.280\n He's the author of the book,\n\n00:13.280 --> 00:16.840\n Lifespan and co founder of several biotech companies.\n\n00:16.840 --> 00:20.800\n He works on turning age into an engineering problem\n\n00:20.800 --> 00:22.160\n and solving it.\n\n00:22.160 --> 00:23.960\n Driven by a vision of a world\n\n00:23.960 --> 00:25.960\n where billions of people can live much longer\n\n00:25.960 --> 00:28.160\n and much healthier lives.\n\n00:28.160 --> 00:30.360\n Quick mention of our sponsors,\n\n00:30.360 --> 00:33.400\n Onnit, Clear, National Instruments,\n\n00:33.400 --> 00:36.840\n and I, SimpliSafe and Linode.\n\n00:36.840 --> 00:40.040\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n00:40.040 --> 00:42.780\n As a side note, let me say that longevity research\n\n00:42.780 --> 00:45.880\n challenges us to think how science and engineering\n\n00:45.880 --> 00:47.640\n will change society.\n\n00:47.640 --> 00:50.400\n Imagine if we can live 100,000 years,\n\n00:50.400 --> 00:51.920\n even under controlled conditions,\n\n00:51.920 --> 00:53.720\n like in a spaceship say,\n\n00:53.720 --> 00:55.960\n then suddenly a trip to Alpha Centauri\n\n00:55.960 --> 00:58.840\n that is a 4.37 light years away\n\n00:58.840 --> 01:01.280\n takes a single human lifespan.\n\n01:01.280 --> 01:05.160\n And on the psychological, maybe even philosophical level,\n\n01:05.160 --> 01:08.720\n as the horizons of death drifts farther into the distance,\n\n01:08.720 --> 01:11.120\n how will our search for meaning change?\n\n01:11.120 --> 01:13.080\n Does meaning require death\n\n01:13.080 --> 01:15.720\n or does it merely require struggle?\n\n01:15.720 --> 01:19.440\n Reprogramming our biology will require us to delve deeper\n\n01:19.440 --> 01:23.680\n into understanding the human mind and the robot mind.\n\n01:23.680 --> 01:26.600\n Both of these efforts are as exciting of a journey\n\n01:26.600 --> 01:28.160\n as I can imagine.\n\n01:28.160 --> 01:30.320\n This is the Lex Friedman Podcast\n\n01:30.320 --> 01:33.400\n and here is my conversation with David Sinclair.\n\n01:34.360 --> 01:38.320\n I usually feel like the same person when I was 12.\n\n01:38.320 --> 01:42.460\n Like when I, right now, as I think about myself,\n\n01:42.460 --> 01:45.040\n I feel like exactly the same person\n\n01:45.040 --> 01:46.400\n that I was when I was 12.\n\n01:46.400 --> 01:51.400\n And yet, I am getting older, both body and mind,\n\n01:51.400 --> 01:54.240\n and still feel like time hasn't passed at all.\n\n01:54.240 --> 01:56.880\n Do you feel this tension in yourself\n\n01:56.880 --> 02:01.000\n that you're the same person and yet you're aging?\n\n02:01.000 --> 02:04.640\n Yeah, I have this tension that I'm still a kid,\n\n02:04.640 --> 02:05.880\n but that helps in my career.\n\n02:05.880 --> 02:07.920\n Scientists need to have a wonder about the world\n\n02:07.920 --> 02:10.520\n and you don't wanna grow up at 12 year olds\n\n02:10.520 --> 02:13.380\n and even younger, I would say six, seven year olds.\n\n02:13.380 --> 02:16.560\n I've still got that boy in me and I can look at things.\n\n02:16.560 --> 02:18.240\n It's a gift, I think, that I can see things\n\n02:18.240 --> 02:19.960\n for the first time if I choose to,\n\n02:19.960 --> 02:23.160\n and then explain them as I would to a six year old\n\n02:23.160 --> 02:24.960\n because I am that mentally.\n\n02:24.960 --> 02:26.720\n But on the other hand, I'm getting older, right?\n\n02:26.720 --> 02:29.240\n I run a lab of 20 people at Harvard.\n\n02:29.240 --> 02:33.520\n I've got a book, I've got science to do, companies to run,\n\n02:33.520 --> 02:35.680\n and so I have to, on most days,\n\n02:35.680 --> 02:38.160\n just pretend to be a grownup and be mature,\n\n02:38.160 --> 02:40.640\n but I definitely don't feel that way.\n\n02:40.640 --> 02:43.400\n There's something I really appreciated\n\n02:43.400 --> 02:44.920\n in opening your book.\n\n02:44.920 --> 02:46.920\n You talked about your grandmother.\n\n02:46.920 --> 02:50.380\n And on this kind of theme, on this kind of topic,\n\n02:51.240 --> 02:53.720\n she, first of all, had a big influence on you.\n\n02:53.720 --> 02:56.540\n My grandmother had a big influence on me.\n\n02:57.800 --> 02:59.080\n And you also mentioned this poem\n\n02:59.080 --> 03:03.760\n by the author of Winnie the Pooh, Alan Alexander Milne.\n\n03:04.720 --> 03:06.120\n Maybe I can read it real quick\n\n03:06.120 --> 03:10.280\n because I love, on the topic of being children,\n\n03:10.280 --> 03:12.560\n when I was one, I had just begun.\n\n03:12.560 --> 03:14.800\n When I was two, I was nearly new.\n\n03:14.800 --> 03:17.240\n When I was three, I was hardly me.\n\n03:17.240 --> 03:19.840\n When I was four, I was not much more.\n\n03:19.840 --> 03:24.320\n When I was five, I was just alive, but now I am six.\n\n03:24.320 --> 03:27.480\n I am as clever, as clever, so I think I'll be six,\n\n03:27.480 --> 03:29.600\n now, forever and ever.\n\n03:31.440 --> 03:36.440\n So this idea of being six and staying six forever,\n\n03:37.720 --> 03:39.320\n being youthful, being curious,\n\n03:39.320 --> 03:43.360\n being childlike, this and other things,\n\n03:43.360 --> 03:46.760\n what influence has your grandmother had\n\n03:46.760 --> 03:51.540\n in your thinking about life, about death, about love?\n\n03:53.200 --> 03:54.920\n Yeah, I was getting misty eyed as you read that\n\n03:54.920 --> 03:58.040\n because that poem was read to me very often,\n\n03:58.040 --> 03:59.520\n if not every day, by my grandmother,\n\n03:59.520 --> 04:01.400\n who partially raised me.\n\n04:02.300 --> 04:06.420\n And she was as much a bohemian as an artist, philosopher.\n\n04:06.420 --> 04:08.120\n And she's one of those people\n\n04:08.120 --> 04:09.760\n that wouldn't talk about the little things.\n\n04:09.760 --> 04:11.560\n She said, I hate small talk.\n\n04:11.560 --> 04:13.960\n Don't talk to me about politics or the weather.\n\n04:13.960 --> 04:16.920\n Yeah, talk to me about human beings and culture.\n\n04:16.920 --> 04:18.040\n So I was raised on that,\n\n04:18.040 --> 04:20.600\n and this poem was one that she read to me often\n\n04:20.600 --> 04:25.600\n because she knew that the mind of a child is precious,\n\n04:26.040 --> 04:28.520\n it's honest, it's pure.\n\n04:28.520 --> 04:31.480\n And she grew up during the Second World War\n\n04:31.480 --> 04:35.680\n and in Hungary and Budapest witnessed the worst of humanity.\n\n04:35.680 --> 04:40.060\n She was trying to save a whole group of Jewish friends\n\n04:40.060 --> 04:43.180\n in her apartment, saw what happened after the World War,\n\n04:43.180 --> 04:47.760\n which was there was, the Russians were in control\n\n04:47.760 --> 04:50.320\n and locals weren't necessarily treated well\n\n04:50.320 --> 04:52.520\n if they were rebellious, which she was.\n\n04:52.520 --> 04:54.440\n And then there was the revolution in 56,\n\n04:54.440 --> 04:57.240\n which she was part of and had to escape the country.\n\n04:57.240 --> 05:01.260\n So she saw what can happen when humans do their worst.\n\n05:01.260 --> 05:05.240\n And her words to me, expressed in part through that poem\n\n05:05.240 --> 05:09.560\n was, David, always stay young and innocent\n\n05:09.560 --> 05:11.600\n and have wonder about the world,\n\n05:11.600 --> 05:15.440\n and then do your best to make humanity the best it can be.\n\n05:15.440 --> 05:18.340\n And that's who I am, that's what I live for,\n\n05:18.340 --> 05:19.800\n that's what I get up in the morning to do\n\n05:19.800 --> 05:21.640\n is to leave the world a better place\n\n05:21.640 --> 05:23.180\n and show to whoever's watching us,\n\n05:23.180 --> 05:26.760\n whether it's aliens or some future human historian,\n\n05:26.760 --> 05:29.520\n that we can do better than we did in the 20th century.\n\n05:31.240 --> 05:33.200\n You know, we mentioned offline this idea\n\n05:33.200 --> 05:34.920\n of bringing people back to life\n\n05:34.920 --> 05:38.240\n through artificial intelligence,\n\n05:38.240 --> 05:40.880\n sort of, I don't know if you've seen videos\n\n05:40.880 --> 05:45.200\n of basically animating people back to life,\n\n05:45.200 --> 05:47.960\n meaning whether it's, for me personally,\n\n05:47.960 --> 05:51.600\n I've been working on specifically about Albert Einstein,\n\n05:51.600 --> 05:55.760\n but also Alan Turing, Isaac Newton, and Richard Feynman.\n\n05:56.740 --> 05:59.520\n And it's an opportunity to bring people\n\n05:59.520 --> 06:02.360\n that meant a lot to others in the world\n\n06:02.360 --> 06:06.240\n and animate them and be able to have a conversation\n\n06:06.240 --> 06:10.300\n with them at first to try to visually,\n\n06:12.740 --> 06:17.200\n visually explore the full richness of character\n\n06:17.200 --> 06:18.800\n that they had as they struggle\n\n06:18.800 --> 06:20.880\n with the ideas of the modern age.\n\n06:20.880 --> 06:24.120\n Sort of, it's less about bringing back their mind\n\n06:24.120 --> 06:27.440\n and more bringing back the visual quirks\n\n06:27.440 --> 06:28.960\n that made them who they are.\n\n06:28.960 --> 06:30.960\n And then maybe in the future,\n\n06:30.960 --> 06:33.200\n it's using the textual, the visual,\n\n06:33.200 --> 06:38.200\n the video, the audio data to actually compress\n\n06:38.600 --> 06:41.080\n down the person for who they are\n\n06:41.080 --> 06:42.460\n and be able to generate text.\n\n06:42.460 --> 06:44.520\n There's a few companies, there's Replica,\n\n06:44.520 --> 06:46.920\n which is a chat engine that was born\n\n06:46.920 --> 06:48.460\n out of the idea of bringing,\n\n06:48.460 --> 06:53.440\n the founder lost her friend to,\n\n06:53.440 --> 06:55.840\n he got run over by a car.\n\n06:55.840 --> 06:59.740\n And the initial reason she founded the company\n\n06:59.740 --> 07:02.840\n was trying to just have a conversation with her friend.\n\n07:02.840 --> 07:07.400\n She trained machine learning, natural language system\n\n07:07.400 --> 07:09.480\n on the texts that they exchange with each other\n\n07:09.480 --> 07:11.880\n and try, she had a conversation with him\n\n07:11.880 --> 07:13.880\n sort of after he was gone.\n\n07:13.880 --> 07:16.880\n And it's very, the conversation was very trivial.\n\n07:16.880 --> 07:21.200\n It was obvious that it's AI agent,\n\n07:21.200 --> 07:23.200\n but it gave her solace.\n\n07:23.200 --> 07:26.080\n It made her actually feel really good.\n\n07:26.080 --> 07:27.920\n And that's the way I wonder if it's possible\n\n07:27.920 --> 07:30.840\n to bring back people that are,\n\n07:30.840 --> 07:32.520\n that mean something to us personally,\n\n07:32.520 --> 07:36.640\n not just Einstein, but people that we've lost\n\n07:36.640 --> 07:40.480\n and in that way achieve a kind of small\n\n07:40.480 --> 07:42.680\n artificial immortality.\n\n07:42.680 --> 07:44.700\n I don't know if you think about this kind of stuff.\n\n07:44.700 --> 07:46.800\n Well, I definitely think about a lot of things.\n\n07:46.800 --> 07:47.640\n That one's a really good one.\n\n07:47.640 --> 07:49.160\n There's a great Black Mirror episode\n\n07:49.160 --> 07:52.840\n about the wife who brings back the boyfriend or husband.\n\n07:52.840 --> 07:54.280\n I think one of the challenges\n\n07:54.280 --> 07:55.520\n with bringing back Richard Feynman\n\n07:55.520 --> 07:58.080\n would be to capture his sense of humor,\n\n07:58.080 --> 07:59.300\n but that would be awesome.\n\n07:59.300 --> 08:00.940\n But yeah, bringing back loved ones would be great,\n\n08:00.940 --> 08:05.940\n especially if they're young and they die early,\n\n08:07.680 --> 08:09.180\n though it may hold you back from moving on.\n\n08:09.180 --> 08:11.840\n That's another thing that could happen as a negative.\n\n08:11.840 --> 08:12.680\n But I think that's great.\n\n08:12.680 --> 08:14.680\n And I also think that it's gonna be possible,\n\n08:14.680 --> 08:17.260\n especially when we're recording some of us,\n\n08:17.260 --> 08:18.440\n every aspect of our lives,\n\n08:18.440 --> 08:22.600\n whether it's our face or things we see, right?\n\n08:22.600 --> 08:26.040\n Eventually one day, everything we see can be recorded.\n\n08:26.040 --> 08:28.980\n And then you can build somebody's experience\n\n08:28.980 --> 08:31.840\n and thoughts, speech,\n\n08:31.840 --> 08:35.000\n and you will have replicas of everybody,\n\n08:35.000 --> 08:36.440\n at least digitally,\n\n08:36.440 --> 08:38.740\n and physically you could do that too one day.\n\n08:38.740 --> 08:40.360\n But that's a good idea,\n\n08:40.360 --> 08:42.640\n especially because there are people that I'd like to meet,\n\n08:42.640 --> 08:44.940\n and I think it's easier than building a time machine.\n\n08:44.940 --> 08:47.320\n One person I'd love to meet is Benjamin Franklin.\n\n08:47.320 --> 08:48.160\n Really?\n\n08:48.160 --> 08:50.720\n Well, I wouldn't go back in time.\n\n08:50.720 --> 08:53.140\n I would, but I'd prefer to bring him into the future\n\n08:53.140 --> 08:57.040\n and say, can you believe we have this thinking machine\n\n08:57.040 --> 08:58.420\n in our pockets now?\n\n08:58.420 --> 09:00.240\n And just see the look on his face\n\n09:00.240 --> 09:01.320\n as to where humanity has come.\n\n09:01.320 --> 09:03.480\n Because I think of him as a modern guy\n\n09:03.480 --> 09:05.480\n that just was before his time.\n\n09:05.480 --> 09:08.520\n Yeah, so you're thinking Benjamin Franklin the scientist,\n\n09:08.520 --> 09:10.400\n not Benjamin Franklin the political thing.\n\n09:10.400 --> 09:13.040\n Because he'd be very upset with Congress right now.\n\n09:13.040 --> 09:13.880\n Right.\n\n09:13.880 --> 09:16.160\n So maybe talk to him about science and technology,\n\n09:16.160 --> 09:18.160\n not politics.\n\n09:18.160 --> 09:19.600\n Or maybe just don't get him on Twitter\n\n09:19.600 --> 09:22.400\n because he'll be very upset with human civilization.\n\n09:22.400 --> 09:25.360\n You know, I wonder what their personalities are like.\n\n09:25.360 --> 09:28.640\n Isaac Newton, it does seem complicated\n\n09:28.640 --> 09:30.480\n to figure out what their personality is like.\n\n09:30.480 --> 09:33.320\n Even Friedrich Nietzsche, who I also thought about.\n\n09:33.320 --> 09:36.800\n Feynman is, we just have enough video\n\n09:36.800 --> 09:39.360\n where we get the full kind of,\n\n09:39.360 --> 09:42.440\n I mean, it shows you how important it is\n\n09:42.440 --> 09:47.440\n to get not the official kind of book level presentation\n\n09:47.560 --> 09:49.560\n of a human, but the authentic,\n\n09:49.560 --> 09:51.960\n the full spectrum of humanity.\n\n09:51.960 --> 09:54.420\n You mentioned collecting data about a person,\n\n09:54.420 --> 09:57.280\n collecting the whole thing, the whole of life,\n\n09:57.280 --> 09:59.480\n the ups and downs, the embarrassing stuff,\n\n09:59.480 --> 10:01.600\n the beautiful stuff, not just the things\n\n10:01.600 --> 10:03.160\n that's condensed into a book.\n\n10:03.160 --> 10:05.880\n And then with Feynman, you start to see that a little bit.\n\n10:05.880 --> 10:07.940\n Through conversations, you start to see peaks\n\n10:07.940 --> 10:09.240\n of like that genius.\n\n10:09.240 --> 10:12.920\n And then through stories about him from others.\n\n10:12.920 --> 10:15.680\n And then certainly you, the sad thing\n\n10:15.680 --> 10:17.720\n about Alan Turing, for example,\n\n10:17.720 --> 10:22.240\n is there's very little, if any, recording of him.\n\n10:22.240 --> 10:24.160\n In fact, I haven't been able to find recording\n\n10:24.160 --> 10:27.440\n allegedly there's supposed to be a recording of him\n\n10:27.440 --> 10:29.720\n doing some kind of a radio broadcast,\n\n10:29.720 --> 10:32.120\n but I haven't been able to find anything.\n\n10:32.120 --> 10:35.680\n And so that's truly sad that it feels like\n\n10:35.680 --> 10:40.360\n it makes you realize how the upside,\n\n10:40.360 --> 10:44.000\n how nice it is to collect data about a person,\n\n10:44.000 --> 10:46.280\n to capture that person.\n\n10:46.280 --> 10:48.740\n That's the upside of the modern internet age,\n\n10:48.740 --> 10:51.340\n the digital age, that that information,\n\n10:51.340 --> 10:54.200\n yeah, creates a kind of immortality.\n\n10:55.700 --> 10:57.100\n And then you can choose to highlight\n\n10:57.100 --> 10:58.220\n the best parts of the person,\n\n10:58.220 --> 11:00.580\n maybe throw away the ugly parts\n\n11:00.580 --> 11:03.460\n and celebrate them even after they're gone.\n\n11:03.460 --> 11:05.100\n So that's a really interesting opportunity.\n\n11:05.100 --> 11:07.900\n You've also mentioned to me offline\n\n11:07.900 --> 11:11.060\n that you're really excited about all the different wearables\n\n11:11.060 --> 11:14.020\n and all the different ways we can collect information\n\n11:14.020 --> 11:18.060\n about our bodies, about the whole thing.\n\n11:18.060 --> 11:21.180\n What's most exciting to you in terms of collecting\n\n11:21.180 --> 11:26.180\n the biological data about a human being?\n\n11:27.860 --> 11:29.300\n Well, so I'm a biologist.\n\n11:29.300 --> 11:33.120\n I find animals and humans as machines very interesting.\n\n11:34.060 --> 11:36.500\n It's one of the reasons I didn't become an engineer\n\n11:36.500 --> 11:37.340\n or a surgeon.\n\n11:37.340 --> 11:39.580\n I wanted to understand how we actually are built.\n\n11:40.580 --> 11:45.580\n And so I think a lot about machines merging with humans.\n\n11:46.020 --> 11:49.020\n And the first of that are the bio wearables.\n\n11:49.020 --> 11:51.380\n And so I talked a lot about this, I wrote about it\n\n11:51.380 --> 11:54.120\n in Lifespan, the book, and pictured a future\n\n11:54.120 --> 11:56.860\n where you would be monitored constantly\n\n11:56.860 --> 11:59.280\n so that you wouldn't suddenly have a heart attack,\n\n11:59.280 --> 12:00.220\n you'd know that was coming,\n\n12:00.220 --> 12:02.620\n or you wouldn't go to the doctor\n\n12:02.620 --> 12:05.660\n and they don't know if you need an antibiotic or not.\n\n12:07.540 --> 12:09.980\n Long term, how old are you, how to fix things,\n\n12:09.980 --> 12:11.540\n what should you eat, what should you take,\n\n12:11.540 --> 12:12.980\n what should your doctor do?\n\n12:12.980 --> 12:16.100\n These devices, I predicted, would be smarter,\n\n12:16.100 --> 12:18.100\n better educated than your physician\n\n12:18.100 --> 12:19.700\n and would augment them.\n\n12:19.700 --> 12:21.460\n And then there'd be a human that would just tick off\n\n12:21.460 --> 12:24.300\n to see if it's correct and they approve.\n\n12:24.300 --> 12:26.820\n I also was predicting in the book\n\n12:26.820 --> 12:30.180\n that we would have video conferences with our doctors\n\n12:30.180 --> 12:32.020\n and that medicines would be delivered,\n\n12:32.020 --> 12:33.940\n initially by courier, but eventually by drones\n\n12:33.940 --> 12:36.220\n and get it to you sometimes in an emergency.\n\n12:36.220 --> 12:37.980\n And that we could even have pills\n\n12:37.980 --> 12:41.820\n that were synthesized or delivered in your kitchen\n\n12:41.820 --> 12:43.920\n and combined certainly.\n\n12:43.920 --> 12:47.100\n What's amazing about that is that, what are we now,\n\n12:47.100 --> 12:50.180\n two years since the book came out, even less,\n\n12:50.180 --> 12:52.380\n and that future is basically here already.\n\n12:52.380 --> 12:56.860\n COVID 19 accelerated that incredibly.\n\n12:56.860 --> 12:58.480\n So where we're at now in society is,\n\n12:58.480 --> 13:00.620\n if you wanna pay for it, you can have a blood test\n\n13:00.620 --> 13:03.580\n that will detect cancer 10, 20 years earlier than it would\n\n13:03.580 --> 13:05.340\n before it forms a tumor.\n\n13:05.340 --> 13:07.940\n You can, of course, do your genome very cheaply\n\n13:07.940 --> 13:09.380\n for less than $100 now.\n\n13:10.840 --> 13:12.960\n There are bio wearables already I wear,\n\n13:12.960 --> 13:17.180\n this ring from Aura that I have a number of years of data.\n\n13:17.180 --> 13:19.220\n I've been doing blood tests for the last 12 years\n\n13:19.220 --> 13:22.580\n with a company called Inside Tracker, which I consult for.\n\n13:22.580 --> 13:24.220\n And so I have all of that data as well.\n\n13:24.220 --> 13:27.700\n And there's 34 different parameters on my testosterone,\n\n13:27.700 --> 13:30.020\n my blood glucose, my inflammation.\n\n13:30.020 --> 13:32.700\n And I use all that data to, of course,\n\n13:32.700 --> 13:34.720\n I wear a watch that measures things as well.\n\n13:34.720 --> 13:39.280\n I use that data to keep my body in optimal shape.\n\n13:39.280 --> 13:40.660\n So I'm now 51.\n\n13:40.660 --> 13:42.140\n And according to those parameters,\n\n13:42.140 --> 13:45.740\n I'm at least as good as someone in their early 40s.\n\n13:45.740 --> 13:47.200\n And if I really work at it,\n\n13:47.200 --> 13:52.020\n I can get my biochemistry down to early to mid 30s,\n\n13:52.020 --> 13:56.220\n though I like to now eat a little dessert once in a while.\n\n13:56.220 --> 13:58.700\n So that's the future we're in right now.\n\n13:58.700 --> 14:00.900\n Anyone can do what I just said.\n\n14:00.900 --> 14:04.340\n But in the very near future, just in the next few years,\n\n14:04.340 --> 14:06.380\n you can be wearing wearables.\n\n14:06.380 --> 14:08.540\n So I'm currently wearing a little,\n\n14:08.540 --> 14:10.960\n what's called a bio sticker.\n\n14:10.960 --> 14:14.100\n This one I just put on last night.\n\n14:14.100 --> 14:18.580\n It's about an inch long, a few millimeters.\n\n14:18.580 --> 14:21.660\n Yeah, for people just listening, it's on David's chest.\n\n14:21.660 --> 14:23.180\n It's just, how does it attach?\n\n14:23.180 --> 14:24.300\n It's just kind of.\n\n14:24.300 --> 14:25.380\n It sticks on. Sticks on.\n\n14:25.380 --> 14:27.740\n Yeah, so on one side you have an on button that you press.\n\n14:27.740 --> 14:30.500\n The lights come on, flashes four times, it's good to go.\n\n14:30.500 --> 14:32.980\n It immediately syncs to your phone.\n\n14:32.980 --> 14:37.260\n And this one, it's called a bio button, a nice name.\n\n14:37.260 --> 14:39.460\n And there's another one that I have that I haven't tried yet\n\n14:39.460 --> 14:41.500\n that does EKG on your heart.\n\n14:41.500 --> 14:43.380\n This is mainly for doctors to monitor patients\n\n14:43.380 --> 14:45.620\n that go home after a heart attack or surgery.\n\n14:45.620 --> 14:48.940\n But that's medical grade FDA approved device.\n\n14:48.940 --> 14:51.260\n So there will be a day, in fact, it's already here,\n\n14:51.260 --> 14:55.260\n that doctors are using these to get patients to go home\n\n14:55.260 --> 14:59.460\n and save a week in hospital, $2,000 at least\n\n14:59.460 --> 15:00.940\n for each patient.\n\n15:00.940 --> 15:04.460\n That's massive savings for the hospital.\n\n15:04.460 --> 15:06.580\n But ultimately what I'm excited about is a future\n\n15:06.580 --> 15:10.760\n that isn't that far off where everybody,\n\n15:10.760 --> 15:11.780\n certainly in developed countries,\n\n15:11.780 --> 15:14.340\n eventually these will cost a few cents and rechargeable.\n\n15:14.340 --> 15:16.620\n The only cost will be the software subscription\n\n15:16.620 --> 15:19.220\n that can be monitored constantly.\n\n15:19.220 --> 15:21.020\n And to give an idea what this is measuring me\n\n15:21.020 --> 15:26.020\n at a thousand times a second is my vibrations as I speak,\n\n15:26.220 --> 15:29.580\n my orientation, it already has told me this morning\n\n15:29.580 --> 15:33.220\n how I slept, where I slept, what side I slept on.\n\n15:33.220 --> 15:37.000\n We've got sneezing, coughing, body temperature,\n\n15:37.000 --> 15:40.840\n heart rate, heart of other parameters of the heart\n\n15:40.840 --> 15:42.440\n that would indicate heart health.\n\n15:44.000 --> 15:49.000\n These data are being used to now to predict sickness.\n\n15:49.880 --> 15:53.640\n So eventually we'll have just in the next year or so\n\n15:53.640 --> 15:55.520\n the ability to predict whether something\n\n15:55.520 --> 15:58.160\n or diagnose whether something is pneumonia\n\n15:58.160 --> 16:02.840\n or just a rhinovirus that can be treated or not.\n\n16:02.840 --> 16:06.360\n This is really going to not just revolutionize medicine,\n\n16:06.360 --> 16:08.480\n but I think extend lives dramatically.\n\n16:08.480 --> 16:11.520\n Because if I'm gonna have a heart attack next week\n\n16:11.520 --> 16:14.440\n and that's possible, this device should know that\n\n16:14.440 --> 16:16.960\n and I'll be in hospital before I even have it.\n\n16:16.960 --> 16:19.280\n Maybe you can talk a little bit about InsideTracker\n\n16:19.280 --> 16:23.000\n because I saw that there's some really cool things in there.\n\n16:23.000 --> 16:25.960\n Like it actually, so maybe you can talk about,\n\n16:25.960 --> 16:29.240\n I guess that you're collecting blood to give it the data.\n\n16:29.240 --> 16:32.480\n So, and it has like basic recommendations\n\n16:32.480 --> 16:34.200\n on how to improve your life.\n\n16:34.200 --> 16:36.560\n So we're not just talking about diseases, right?\n\n16:36.560 --> 16:39.080\n Like anticipating having a particular disease,\n\n16:39.080 --> 16:41.840\n but it's almost like guiding your trajectory to life,\n\n16:41.840 --> 16:44.600\n how to, whether it's extend your life\n\n16:44.600 --> 16:46.680\n or just live a more fulfilling,\n\n16:46.680 --> 16:48.160\n like improve the quality of life.\n\n16:48.160 --> 16:50.600\n I suppose this is the right way to say it.\n\n16:50.600 --> 16:52.460\n How does InsideTracker work?\n\n16:52.460 --> 16:53.300\n What the heck is it?\n\n16:53.300 --> 16:55.080\n Because I thought there was also pretty cool.\n\n16:55.080 --> 16:55.920\n Yeah.\n\n16:55.920 --> 16:56.760\n What is it?\n\n16:56.760 --> 16:58.240\n Is it something other people can use?\n\n16:58.240 --> 16:59.720\n You can definitely use it.\n\n16:59.720 --> 17:02.040\n You can sign up, it's consumer.\n\n17:02.040 --> 17:04.440\n It's like a company consumer facing company.\n\n17:04.440 --> 17:06.040\n It is, yeah.\n\n17:06.040 --> 17:08.960\n And I also want to democratize the ability\n\n17:08.960 --> 17:11.000\n to just take a mouth swab eventually.\n\n17:11.000 --> 17:13.560\n We don't need to have a blood test necessarily,\n\n17:13.560 --> 17:14.640\n but for now it's a blood test\n\n17:14.640 --> 17:18.380\n and you'd go to a lab core request in the US.\n\n17:18.380 --> 17:19.840\n It's also available overseas.\n\n17:19.840 --> 17:22.540\n You can upload your own data for a minimal cost\n\n17:22.540 --> 17:26.560\n and get the algorithms, the AI in the background\n\n17:26.560 --> 17:27.880\n to take that data,\n\n17:27.880 --> 17:31.560\n plot where you are against others in your age group\n\n17:31.560 --> 17:34.120\n in terms of health and longevity at bio age.\n\n17:34.120 --> 17:36.000\n They call it inner age,\n\n17:36.000 --> 17:38.120\n but also it provides recommendations.\n\n17:38.120 --> 17:39.640\n And this isn't just a bunch of BS.\n\n17:39.640 --> 17:42.520\n It sounds like it might be to say, I'll go eat this\n\n17:42.520 --> 17:44.360\n or go to that restaurant and order that,\n\n17:44.360 --> 17:47.000\n but it's actually based on the basic.\n\n17:47.000 --> 17:49.800\n This company has entered hundreds.\n\n17:49.800 --> 17:51.760\n Now it would be thousands of scientific papers\n\n17:51.760 --> 17:53.160\n into their database\n\n17:53.160 --> 17:55.720\n and hundreds of thousands of human data points.\n\n17:55.720 --> 17:59.040\n And they have tens of thousands of individuals\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:00.360\n that have been tracked over time\n\n18:00.360 --> 18:02.920\n and anonymously that data is used to say\n\n18:02.920 --> 18:04.240\n what works and what doesn't.\n\n18:04.240 --> 18:05.720\n If you eat that, what works?\n\n18:05.720 --> 18:07.600\n If you take that supplement, what works?\n\n18:07.600 --> 18:09.620\n And I was a coauthor on a paper that showed\n\n18:09.620 --> 18:13.440\n that the recommendations for food and supplements\n\n18:15.040 --> 18:18.040\n was better than the leading drug for type two diabetes.\n\n18:18.920 --> 18:19.760\n That's so cool.\n\n18:19.760 --> 18:21.660\n The idea that you can connect,\n\n18:21.660 --> 18:24.880\n like skipping the human having to do this work,\n\n18:24.880 --> 18:27.380\n you can connect the scientific papers,\n\n18:27.380 --> 18:30.080\n almost like meta analysis of the science\n\n18:30.080 --> 18:32.480\n connected to the individual data.\n\n18:32.480 --> 18:35.400\n And then based on that sort of connect your data\n\n18:35.400 --> 18:37.880\n to whatever the proper group is\n\n18:37.880 --> 18:40.440\n within the whatever the scientific paper is\n\n18:40.440 --> 18:44.840\n to make the suggestion of how like how that work\n\n18:44.840 --> 18:47.120\n applies to your life.\n\n18:47.120 --> 18:49.640\n And then that ultimately maps to like a recommendation\n\n18:49.640 --> 18:51.240\n of what you should do with your life.\n\n18:51.240 --> 18:54.520\n Like it all like this giant system\n\n18:54.520 --> 18:55.700\n that ultimately recommends\n\n18:55.700 --> 18:58.440\n you should drink more coffee or less.\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:00.280\n Right, and we'll have the genome in there as well.\n\n19:00.280 --> 19:01.200\n You can upload that.\n\n19:01.200 --> 19:02.440\n Yeah, it's awesome.\n\n19:02.440 --> 19:04.640\n So these programs will know us way better\n\n19:04.640 --> 19:07.480\n than we do and our doctors as well.\n\n19:07.480 --> 19:08.960\n The idea of going to a doctor once a year\n\n19:08.960 --> 19:11.940\n for an annual checkup and having males get a finger\n\n19:11.940 --> 19:16.000\n up their butt and you cough, that to me is a joke.\n\n19:16.000 --> 19:18.140\n That's medieval medicine.\n\n19:18.140 --> 19:21.440\n And that's very soon going to be seen as medieval.\n\n19:21.440 --> 19:25.920\n Yeah, to me as a computer science person,\n\n19:25.920 --> 19:28.640\n it's always upsetting to go to the doctor\n\n19:28.640 --> 19:31.120\n and just look at him and like realize\n\n19:31.120 --> 19:33.160\n you know nothing about me.\n\n19:33.160 --> 19:38.160\n Like you're making your like opinions based on like,\n\n19:38.560 --> 19:42.540\n it is very valuable, years of intuition building\n\n19:42.540 --> 19:45.880\n about basic symptoms, but you're just like it is medieval.\n\n19:45.880 --> 19:47.200\n They're very good at it.\n\n19:47.200 --> 19:51.360\n In fact, doctors in medieval times were probably damn good\n\n19:51.360 --> 19:53.600\n at working with very little.\n\n19:53.600 --> 19:58.520\n But the thing is, I'd rather prefer a doctor\n\n19:58.520 --> 20:00.040\n that doesn't really know what they're doing,\n\n20:00.040 --> 20:02.200\n but has a huge amount of data to work with.\n\n20:03.080 --> 20:03.920\n Well, you're right.\n\n20:03.920 --> 20:05.600\n And many of my good friends are doctors.\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:06.520\n I work at Harvard.\n\n20:06.520 --> 20:09.640\n So I'm not against the profession at all.\n\n20:09.640 --> 20:11.680\n But I think that they need just as much help\n\n20:11.680 --> 20:13.480\n as anyone else does.\n\n20:13.480 --> 20:15.320\n We wouldn't drive a car without a dashboard.\n\n20:15.320 --> 20:16.140\n We wouldn't think of it.\n\n20:16.140 --> 20:18.720\n So why would doctors do the same?\n\n20:18.720 --> 20:21.400\n If we could, could we step back to the big,\n\n20:21.400 --> 20:23.680\n profound, philosophical, both tragic\n\n20:23.680 --> 20:25.500\n and beautiful question about age?\n\n20:26.360 --> 20:28.700\n How and why do we age?\n\n20:28.700 --> 20:31.520\n Is it from an engineering perspective?\n\n20:31.520 --> 20:33.720\n You said you like the biological machine.\n\n20:33.720 --> 20:37.760\n Is that a feature or a bug of the biological machine?\n\n20:37.760 --> 20:40.720\n It is both a bug and a feature.\n\n20:40.720 --> 20:44.640\n Evolutionary speaking, we only live as long as we need to\n\n20:44.640 --> 20:46.280\n to replace ourselves efficiently.\n\n20:47.360 --> 20:49.320\n If you're a mouse, you're only gonna live two\n\n20:49.320 --> 20:50.600\n and a half years, three years.\n\n20:50.600 --> 20:51.880\n You're probably gonna die of starvation,\n\n20:51.880 --> 20:54.440\n predation, freezing in the winter.\n\n20:54.440 --> 20:57.120\n So they divert most of their resources\n\n20:57.120 --> 20:59.320\n to reproducing rapidly,\n\n20:59.320 --> 21:00.960\n but they don't put a lot of energy\n\n21:00.960 --> 21:04.320\n into preserving their soma, which is their body.\n\n21:04.320 --> 21:06.640\n Conversely, a baleen type of whale,\n\n21:06.640 --> 21:09.320\n a bowhead whale in particular will live hundreds of years\n\n21:09.320 --> 21:11.060\n because they're at the top of the food chain\n\n21:11.060 --> 21:12.640\n and they can live as long as they want.\n\n21:12.640 --> 21:15.120\n So they breed slowly and build a body that lasts.\n\n21:15.120 --> 21:17.400\n We're somewhere in between because we've, you know,\n\n21:17.400 --> 21:19.680\n we've really only just come out of the savannas\n\n21:19.680 --> 21:22.080\n where we could be picked off by a cat.\n\n21:22.080 --> 21:25.400\n We were pretty wimpy going back 6 million years ago.\n\n21:25.400 --> 21:30.080\n So we actually need to evolve quicker than evolution will.\n\n21:30.080 --> 21:33.560\n And that's why we can use our oversized brains\n\n21:33.560 --> 21:36.140\n and intuition to give us what evolution\n\n21:36.140 --> 21:38.280\n not only didn't give us, but took away from us.\n\n21:38.280 --> 21:40.680\n Now we're pathetic, look at our bodies.\n\n21:40.680 --> 21:42.920\n These arms, if any of us, even the strongest person\n\n21:42.920 --> 21:45.000\n in the world went in a cage with a chimpanzee,\n\n21:45.000 --> 21:47.400\n the chimp could knock that person's head off, no question.\n\n21:47.400 --> 21:48.240\n So we're pathetic.\n\n21:48.240 --> 21:50.280\n So we need to engineer ourselves to be healthier\n\n21:50.280 --> 21:51.580\n and longer lived.\n\n21:51.580 --> 21:55.680\n So getting to aging, we can do better, right?\n\n21:55.680 --> 21:57.260\n Whales do way better.\n\n21:57.260 --> 21:59.500\n We're trying to learn how whales do that.\n\n21:59.500 --> 22:03.300\n And if you ask really anybody in the field now, professor,\n\n22:03.300 --> 22:07.360\n they'll say there are eight or nine hallmarks of aging,\n\n22:07.360 --> 22:11.520\n which are really, it's a word for causes of aging.\n\n22:11.520 --> 22:13.500\n So that you probably have heard of some of these,\n\n22:13.500 --> 22:16.600\n your listeners will have loss of telomeres,\n\n22:16.600 --> 22:19.600\n the ends of the chromosomes, like the little ends\n\n22:19.600 --> 22:21.880\n of shoelaces, that kind of thing.\n\n22:21.880 --> 22:24.880\n They get too short, cells stop dividing, become senescent.\n\n22:24.880 --> 22:28.560\n They become, they put out what are called mitogens\n\n22:28.560 --> 22:31.040\n that cause cancer and inflammatory molecules.\n\n22:31.040 --> 22:34.280\n So that's another aspect of aging, cellular senescence.\n\n22:34.280 --> 22:35.880\n Another one is loss of the energetic.\n\n22:35.880 --> 22:38.680\n So mitochondria, the battery packs wind down.\n\n22:39.720 --> 22:43.080\n There's a whole bunch, stem cells, proteostasis.\n\n22:43.080 --> 22:45.440\n Well, these are our Achilles heels that I'm talking about.\n\n22:45.440 --> 22:48.400\n They're a common amongst all life forms, really.\n\n22:48.400 --> 22:51.640\n But if you want me to jump to the chases to where,\n\n22:51.640 --> 22:54.400\n what is the upstream defining factor?\n\n22:54.400 --> 22:57.300\n If we boil it down, what do we get?\n\n22:57.300 --> 22:59.700\n So most biologists would say, you can't boil it down.\n\n22:59.700 --> 23:01.200\n It's too complex.\n\n23:01.200 --> 23:03.640\n I would say you can boil it down to an equation,\n\n23:03.640 --> 23:05.860\n which is the preservation of information\n\n23:05.860 --> 23:09.040\n and loss due to entropy, i.e. noise.\n\n23:09.040 --> 23:11.100\n And that is the basis of my research.\n\n23:12.380 --> 23:14.820\n It originally came out of discoveries in yeast cells,\n\n23:14.820 --> 23:17.240\n where I went to MIT in the 1990s.\n\n23:17.240 --> 23:18.760\n You studied bread.\n\n23:18.760 --> 23:20.200\n I kind of did.\n\n23:20.200 --> 23:22.960\n I studied the makers of bread,\n\n23:22.960 --> 23:25.480\n a little yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae,\n\n23:25.480 --> 23:29.200\n which at the time was one of the hottest, excuse the pun,\n\n23:29.200 --> 23:30.920\n organisms to work on.\n\n23:30.920 --> 23:35.300\n But we figured out in the lab why yeast cells get old\n\n23:35.300 --> 23:37.440\n and found genes that control that process\n\n23:37.440 --> 23:39.000\n and made them live longer,\n\n23:39.000 --> 23:41.400\n which was an amazing four years of my life.\n\n23:41.400 --> 23:46.400\n One of those genes had a name with an acronym SIR2.\n\n23:48.200 --> 23:49.680\n Now the two is irrelevant.\n\n23:49.680 --> 23:51.800\n The SIR is important.\n\n23:51.800 --> 23:53.920\n And the most important letter out of all of those three\n\n23:53.920 --> 23:56.960\n is I, which stands for information.\n\n23:56.960 --> 23:59.620\n Silent information regulator number two,\n\n23:59.620 --> 24:01.080\n when you put more copies of that gene in,\n\n24:01.080 --> 24:02.760\n just put in one more copy,\n\n24:02.760 --> 24:04.720\n the yeast cells lived 30% longer\n\n24:04.720 --> 24:06.080\n and suppressed the cause of aging,\n\n24:06.080 --> 24:09.000\n which was the dysregulation of information in the cell.\n\n24:09.000 --> 24:11.640\n And then, so fast forward to now,\n\n24:11.640 --> 24:14.600\n I've been looking in humans and mice,\n\n24:14.600 --> 24:17.760\n because they live shorter and cheaper to study,\n\n24:17.760 --> 24:20.780\n where the loss of information in our bodies\n\n24:20.780 --> 24:22.580\n is a root cause of aging.\n\n24:22.580 --> 24:24.040\n And I think it is.\n\n24:24.040 --> 24:29.040\n Your boldness in doing biology in this way is fascinating\n\n24:29.520 --> 24:31.840\n because that also leads to a kind of,\n\n24:31.840 --> 24:36.840\n it's almost like allows for a theory of aging,\n\n24:40.280 --> 24:43.080\n like you could boil it down to a single equation\n\n24:43.080 --> 24:45.920\n and it leads to a, perhaps a metric\n\n24:45.920 --> 24:48.620\n that allows you to optimize aging,\n\n24:48.620 --> 24:51.280\n sort of in the fight against entropy.\n\n24:51.280 --> 24:53.820\n I had to figure out which mechanisms, like you said,\n\n24:53.820 --> 24:55.680\n the silent information regulator,\n\n24:55.680 --> 24:58.560\n which mechanisms allow you to preserve information\n\n24:58.560 --> 25:03.560\n without injecting noise, without creating entropy,\n\n25:03.760 --> 25:06.120\n without creating degradation of that information.\n\n25:07.000 --> 25:11.180\n For some reason, converting biology,\n\n25:11.180 --> 25:13.520\n which I thought was mostly impossible\n\n25:13.520 --> 25:15.680\n into an engineering problem,\n\n25:15.680 --> 25:19.400\n feels like it makes it amenable to optimization,\n\n25:19.400 --> 25:23.440\n to solving problems, to creating technology that can,\n\n25:23.440 --> 25:26.680\n whether that's genetic engineering or AI,\n\n25:26.680 --> 25:30.920\n it makes it possible to create the technology\n\n25:30.920 --> 25:35.920\n that would improve the degradation of information and aging.\n\n25:36.240 --> 25:38.160\n Is there more concrete ways you think\n\n25:38.160 --> 25:41.440\n about the kind of information you want to preserve?\n\n25:41.440 --> 25:46.120\n And also, is there good ideas about regulators\n\n25:46.120 --> 25:51.120\n of that information, about ways to prevent the distortion,\n\n25:52.400 --> 25:54.020\n the degradation of that information?\n\n25:54.020 --> 25:56.580\n Right, so we have silent information regulator genes\n\n25:56.580 --> 25:57.420\n in our bodies.\n\n25:57.420 --> 26:00.360\n We have seven of them, SIRT1 through seven, they're called.\n\n26:00.360 --> 26:03.200\n And we found in mice, one way to slow down\n\n26:03.200 --> 26:05.900\n the loss of information is to just give more of these,\n\n26:06.920 --> 26:08.440\n to upregulate these genes.\n\n26:08.440 --> 26:12.000\n So we made a mouse that has more of this SIRT1 gene,\n\n26:12.000 --> 26:15.160\n turned it on, and that slowed down the aging of the brain\n\n26:15.160 --> 26:16.520\n and preserved their information.\n\n26:16.520 --> 26:19.440\n Now, what information am I talking about, you might ask?\n\n26:19.440 --> 26:22.000\n Well, again, you can simplify biology.\n\n26:22.000 --> 26:25.100\n There are two types of information in the cell primarily.\n\n26:25.100 --> 26:27.200\n The one we all read about and know about\n\n26:27.200 --> 26:29.040\n is the DNA, the genome.\n\n26:29.040 --> 26:32.440\n And that's base four information, ATCG,\n\n26:32.440 --> 26:35.240\n the four chemicals that make up the various sequences\n\n26:35.240 --> 26:37.000\n of the genome, billions of letters.\n\n26:37.880 --> 26:39.960\n And that also degrades over time.\n\n26:39.960 --> 26:42.600\n But what's been fascinating is that we find\n\n26:42.600 --> 26:45.120\n that that information is pretty much intact\n\n26:45.120 --> 26:47.280\n in old animals and people.\n\n26:47.280 --> 26:48.240\n You can clone a dog.\n\n26:48.240 --> 26:50.980\n One of my friends in LA just cloned his dog three times.\n\n26:50.980 --> 26:52.080\n So this is doable, right?\n\n26:52.080 --> 26:53.800\n It means that the genome can be intact.\n\n26:53.800 --> 26:56.200\n But what's the other type of information?\n\n26:56.200 --> 26:58.480\n It's the epigenome, the regulators\n\n26:58.480 --> 27:01.220\n of the genetic information.\n\n27:01.220 --> 27:04.380\n And physically, that's really just how the DNA is wrapped up\n\n27:04.380 --> 27:08.040\n or looped out for the cell to access it and read it.\n\n27:08.040 --> 27:11.200\n So it's similar to, and excuse this analogy,\n\n27:11.200 --> 27:15.200\n but it's a good one, a compact disc or a DVD.\n\n27:15.200 --> 27:18.480\n Those pits in the foil are the digital information.\n\n27:18.480 --> 27:19.560\n That's the genome.\n\n27:19.560 --> 27:22.240\n And the epigenome is the reader of that information.\n\n27:22.240 --> 27:25.320\n And in a different cell, you'd read different music,\n\n27:25.320 --> 27:28.000\n different songs, different symphonies.\n\n27:28.000 --> 27:31.600\n And that's what gets laid down when we're in the womb.\n\n27:31.600 --> 27:34.600\n And that makes a skin cell forever a skin cell\n\n27:34.600 --> 27:36.360\n and not a brain cell tomorrow.\n\n27:36.360 --> 27:38.760\n Thank God, otherwise our brains wouldn't work very well.\n\n27:38.760 --> 27:41.200\n But over time, what we see is that the brain cells\n\n27:41.200 --> 27:42.880\n start to look more like skin cells.\n\n27:42.880 --> 27:45.620\n And the kidney cells start to look more like liver cells.\n\n27:45.620 --> 27:48.120\n And what we call X differentiate.\n\n27:48.120 --> 27:49.400\n This is a term that we use in my lab,\n\n27:49.400 --> 27:52.080\n but isn't yet widely used.\n\n27:52.080 --> 27:53.400\n But we needed a term to explain this.\n\n27:53.400 --> 27:55.840\n And that process of X differentiation,\n\n27:55.840 --> 28:00.840\n the loss of the reader of the CD or the DVD,\n\n28:01.160 --> 28:06.160\n we liken that to scratches on the DVD\n\n28:06.200 --> 28:09.440\n so that the reader cannot fully access the information.\n\n28:09.440 --> 28:11.440\n Now we can slow down the scratches, as I mentioned.\n\n28:11.440 --> 28:13.120\n We can turn on these genes.\n\n28:13.120 --> 28:15.880\n We can even put in molecules into the cell\n\n28:15.880 --> 28:18.960\n or even eat them and turn on those pathways,\n\n28:18.960 --> 28:21.520\n which my father and I have been trying to do\n\n28:21.520 --> 28:24.400\n for about a decade to slow things down.\n\n28:24.400 --> 28:26.360\n But the question that I've had is,\n\n28:27.360 --> 28:30.840\n is there a repository of information still in the body?\n\n28:30.840 --> 28:32.240\n Because anyone who knows anything\n\n28:32.240 --> 28:33.400\n about the loss of information\n\n28:33.400 --> 28:35.520\n or even has tried to copy a cassette tape\n\n28:35.520 --> 28:38.720\n or photocopy or Xerox anything knows that over time,\n\n28:38.720 --> 28:41.760\n you lose that information irreparably.\n\n28:41.760 --> 28:43.940\n So I've been looking for a backup copy,\n\n28:43.940 --> 28:46.720\n inspired largely by Claude Shannon's work\n\n28:46.720 --> 28:48.780\n at MIT as well in the 1940s.\n\n28:48.780 --> 28:53.060\n His mathematical theory of communication is just brilliant.\n\n28:53.060 --> 28:55.500\n And so I've been looking for what he called the observer,\n\n28:55.500 --> 28:57.200\n which is the backup copy.\n\n28:57.200 --> 29:01.500\n We today might call that the TCPIP protocol of the internet\n\n29:01.500 --> 29:04.020\n that stores information in case it doesn't make it\n\n29:04.020 --> 29:06.900\n to your computer, it will fill in the gaps.\n\n29:06.900 --> 29:09.380\n And we've been spending about the last five years\n\n29:09.380 --> 29:12.160\n to try and find if there really is a backup copy in the body\n\n29:12.160 --> 29:15.960\n to reset the epigenome and polish those scratches away.\n\n29:15.960 --> 29:16.940\n That's incredible.\n\n29:16.940 --> 29:19.700\n So finding the backup, so whenever there are too many\n\n29:19.700 --> 29:24.540\n scratches pile up, you can just write a new version.\n\n29:24.540 --> 29:26.540\n Like write, not a new version,\n\n29:26.540 --> 29:29.120\n but go to the backup and restore it.\n\n29:29.120 --> 29:31.660\n Right, that's really all we're talking about.\n\n29:31.660 --> 29:34.420\n It's not that hard once you know the trick.\n\n29:34.420 --> 29:38.420\n And for people that actually remember like DVDs\n\n29:38.420 --> 29:41.540\n and scratches on them, how frustrating it is.\n\n29:41.540 --> 29:44.200\n That's a brilliant metaphor for aging.\n\n29:44.200 --> 29:49.200\n And then the reader is the thing that skips\n\n29:51.000 --> 29:53.400\n and then it could destroy your experience,\n\n29:53.400 --> 29:55.800\n the richness of the experience that is listening\n\n29:55.800 --> 29:57.160\n to your favorite song.\n\n29:57.160 --> 29:59.000\n Right, but in biology, it's even worse\n\n29:59.000 --> 30:01.120\n because you'll lose your memory, your kidneys will fail,\n\n30:01.120 --> 30:03.640\n you'll get diabetes, your heart will fail.\n\n30:03.640 --> 30:06.880\n And we call that aging and age related diseases.\n\n30:06.880 --> 30:10.040\n So most people forget that diseases that we get\n\n30:10.040 --> 30:13.860\n when we get old are 80 to 90% caused by aging.\n\n30:13.860 --> 30:15.960\n And we've been trying to fix things with band aids\n\n30:15.960 --> 30:19.040\n after they occur without even generally talking\n\n30:19.040 --> 30:21.360\n about the root cause of the problem.\n\n30:21.360 --> 30:26.240\n Is there the scratches, do those come from,\n\n30:28.260 --> 30:31.880\n are those programmed or are they failures?\n\n30:31.880 --> 30:36.440\n Meaning is it, so if it's by design,\n\n30:36.440 --> 30:40.960\n then there's like a encoded timeline schedule\n\n30:40.960 --> 30:43.000\n that the body's just on purpose,\n\n30:43.000 --> 30:44.560\n degrading the whole thing.\n\n30:44.560 --> 30:47.100\n And then there's the just the wear and tear\n\n30:47.100 --> 30:50.400\n of like the scratches on a disc that happen through time.\n\n30:50.400 --> 30:52.780\n Which one is it that's the source of aging?\n\n30:54.240 --> 30:56.940\n It's more akin to wear and tear, there isn't a program.\n\n30:56.940 --> 31:00.760\n Getting back to evolution, there's no selection for aging.\n\n31:00.760 --> 31:03.600\n We're not designed to age, we just live as long as we need\n\n31:03.600 --> 31:06.160\n to and then we're at the whim of entropy, basically.\n\n31:06.160 --> 31:09.120\n Second law of thermodynamics, stuff falls apart.\n\n31:09.120 --> 31:11.200\n We live a bit longer than age 40,\n\n31:11.200 --> 31:13.420\n only because there are robust, resilient systems,\n\n31:13.420 --> 31:15.320\n but eventually they fail as well.\n\n31:15.320 --> 31:16.940\n Current limit to the human lifespan\n\n31:16.940 --> 31:19.280\n where they completely fail is 122.\n\n31:21.480 --> 31:23.240\n But I don't like to think of it as wear and tear\n\n31:23.240 --> 31:25.880\n because there's two aspects to it.\n\n31:25.880 --> 31:28.080\n There's a system that's built to keep us alive\n\n31:28.080 --> 31:30.960\n when we're young, but actually goes,\n\n31:30.960 --> 31:33.280\n comes back to bite us as we get older.\n\n31:33.280 --> 31:37.800\n And we call this issue antagonistic pleiotropy.\n\n31:37.800 --> 31:39.500\n What's good for you when you're young\n\n31:39.500 --> 31:42.920\n can cause problems when you're older.\n\n31:42.920 --> 31:46.160\n So we've been looking, what is the main causes of the noise?\n\n31:46.160 --> 31:49.320\n And we've found two of them definitively.\n\n31:49.320 --> 31:52.000\n The first one is broken chromosomes.\n\n31:52.000 --> 31:55.000\n When a chromosome breaks, the cell has to panic\n\n31:55.000 --> 31:58.280\n because that's either gonna cause a cancer or kill the cell.\n\n31:58.280 --> 32:01.180\n There's only two outcomes, it's pretty much a problem.\n\n32:01.180 --> 32:05.100\n And so what the cell does is it reorganizes the epigenome\n\n32:05.100 --> 32:06.100\n in a massive way.\n\n32:06.100 --> 32:09.740\n What that leads to is, think of it as a tennis match\n\n32:09.740 --> 32:11.620\n or a ping pong game.\n\n32:11.620 --> 32:13.100\n The proteins are the balls\n\n32:13.100 --> 32:14.940\n and they now leave where they should be,\n\n32:14.940 --> 32:18.140\n which is regulating the genes that make the cell type,\n\n32:18.140 --> 32:18.980\n whatever it is.\n\n32:18.980 --> 32:20.540\n And they have a dual function,\n\n32:20.540 --> 32:22.100\n they actually go to the break,\n\n32:22.100 --> 32:24.620\n the chromosome will break and fix that.\n\n32:24.620 --> 32:26.020\n And then they come back.\n\n32:26.900 --> 32:28.460\n You might ask, well, why is it set up that way?\n\n32:28.460 --> 32:29.300\n Well, it's a beautiful system,\n\n32:29.300 --> 32:30.940\n it coordinates gene expression,\n\n32:30.940 --> 32:32.860\n the control systems with the repair.\n\n32:32.860 --> 32:34.260\n You want them coordinated.\n\n32:34.260 --> 32:36.580\n Problem is, as we get older, this ping pong game,\n\n32:36.580 --> 32:37.700\n some of the balls get lost.\n\n32:37.700 --> 32:40.660\n They don't come back to where they originally started.\n\n32:40.660 --> 32:45.180\n And that's what we think is the main noise for aging.\n\n32:45.180 --> 32:47.660\n And we've also, the other cause of aging that we found\n\n32:47.660 --> 32:51.140\n is cell stress, we damage nerves and they age rapidly.\n\n32:51.140 --> 32:52.860\n So that's the other issue.\n\n32:52.860 --> 32:56.420\n There's probably others, smoking chemicals, for example,\n\n32:56.420 --> 32:59.020\n we know accelerates biological age pretty dramatically.\n\n33:00.380 --> 33:02.300\n But the question is, can you slow that down\n\n33:02.300 --> 33:04.420\n or can you reset them to get those ping pong balls\n\n33:04.420 --> 33:07.180\n to go back to where they originally started in the game?\n\n33:07.180 --> 33:09.780\n And we think we've found a way to do that.\n\n33:09.780 --> 33:11.820\n Can you give me hints?\n\n33:11.820 --> 33:13.980\n Whose fault is it in the balls not coming back?\n\n33:13.980 --> 33:15.780\n Is it the proteins themselves?\n\n33:15.780 --> 33:18.140\n Like are they starting?\n\n33:18.140 --> 33:20.300\n Again, I've been obsessed with the protein folding problem\n\n33:20.300 --> 33:21.140\n from the AI perspective.\n\n33:21.140 --> 33:23.700\n So is it the proteins or is it something else?\n\n33:23.700 --> 33:27.300\n Well, we know who hits the balls and recruits them.\n\n33:27.300 --> 33:31.300\n So that the break is recognized by the cell.\n\n33:31.300 --> 33:34.140\n It's recognized by proteins who send out a signal\n\n33:35.140 --> 33:38.940\n through phosphorylation is typical way cells talk\n\n33:38.940 --> 33:40.980\n to other proteins.\n\n33:40.980 --> 33:43.540\n And that recruits those repair factors,\n\n33:43.540 --> 33:45.100\n those ping pong balls to the break.\n\n33:45.100 --> 33:49.100\n So the cells actively doing this to try and help itself,\n\n33:49.100 --> 33:53.940\n but we don't know who's to blame for them not coming back.\n\n33:53.940 --> 33:58.460\n That could just be a flaw in the quote unquote design.\n\n33:58.460 --> 34:00.300\n I don't think that there's something saying,\n\n34:00.300 --> 34:04.180\n well, 1% of you balls proteins never go back.\n\n34:04.180 --> 34:06.100\n I just think it's hard to reset a system\n\n34:06.100 --> 34:07.660\n that's constantly changing.\n\n34:07.660 --> 34:11.340\n We have in our bodies close to a trillion DNA breaks\n\n34:11.340 --> 34:12.740\n every day.\n\n34:12.740 --> 34:14.260\n And imagine that over 80 years,\n\n34:14.260 --> 34:17.540\n what damage that does to our epigenomic information.\n\n34:17.540 --> 34:20.260\n Now we know that this is, well,\n\n34:20.260 --> 34:21.540\n we never know anything in biology,\n\n34:21.540 --> 34:23.980\n but we have strong evidence that this is true\n\n34:23.980 --> 34:27.580\n because we can mess with animals.\n\n34:27.580 --> 34:30.060\n We can create DNA breaks and tickle them\n\n34:30.060 --> 34:32.940\n with a few breaks, maybe raise it by threefold\n\n34:32.940 --> 34:35.780\n over background levels of normal breakage.\n\n34:35.780 --> 34:38.300\n And if we're right, those mice should get old.\n\n34:39.260 --> 34:40.380\n And they do.\n\n34:40.380 --> 34:42.420\n We can actually, we've created these breaks\n\n34:42.420 --> 34:43.980\n in a way that's titratable.\n\n34:43.980 --> 34:45.260\n We can, it's like a rheostat.\n\n34:45.260 --> 34:47.380\n We can send it to 11.\n\n34:47.380 --> 34:51.380\n I drove my Tesla here, I'm a big fan of a spinal tap too,\n\n34:51.380 --> 34:52.420\n going to 11.\n\n34:52.420 --> 34:54.180\n If we go to 11, we can make a mouse old\n\n34:54.180 --> 34:55.740\n in a matter of months.\n\n34:55.740 --> 34:58.620\n We prefer to go to a level of about four\n\n34:58.620 --> 35:00.220\n and it gets old in 10 months.\n\n35:00.220 --> 35:01.180\n But it's definitely old.\n\n35:01.180 --> 35:03.740\n It's got all of the hallmarks of aging.\n\n35:03.740 --> 35:05.220\n It's got diseases.\n\n35:05.220 --> 35:06.060\n It looks old.\n\n35:06.060 --> 35:06.900\n Its skin is old.\n\n35:06.900 --> 35:08.060\n It's got gray hair.\n\n35:08.060 --> 35:10.020\n But importantly, we can now measure age\n\n35:10.020 --> 35:11.420\n by looking at the scratches.\n\n35:11.420 --> 35:13.460\n We can look at the epigenome, we can measure it\n\n35:13.460 --> 35:15.820\n and use machine learning to give us a number.\n\n35:15.820 --> 35:19.180\n And those mice are 50% older than normal.\n\n35:19.180 --> 35:21.860\n So you can replicate the aging process in a controlled way.\n\n35:21.860 --> 35:24.460\n You can, I mean, in a way that, I mean,\n\n35:24.460 --> 35:28.660\n you could accelerate it in a controlled way\n\n35:28.660 --> 35:31.620\n and measure how much exactly it's aging.\n\n35:31.620 --> 35:35.020\n And that gives you step one of a two step process\n\n35:35.020 --> 35:36.580\n to when you can then figure out,\n\n35:36.580 --> 35:38.020\n how can we reverse this?\n\n35:38.020 --> 35:40.220\n And now we're reversing those mice.\n\n35:40.220 --> 35:42.580\n Is there a good, I love what you said.\n\n35:42.580 --> 35:45.380\n I mean, in biology, you really don't know.\n\n35:45.380 --> 35:47.660\n It's such a beautiful mess.\n\n35:48.540 --> 35:51.500\n Is there ideas how to do that?\n\n35:51.500 --> 35:55.060\n Is that on the genetic engineering level?\n\n35:55.060 --> 35:57.620\n Is it like, what can you mess with?\n\n35:57.620 --> 36:02.300\n Is it going to the, trying to discover the backup copies\n\n36:02.300 --> 36:04.220\n and restoring from them?\n\n36:04.220 --> 36:06.380\n Like what's, if it's possible to convert it\n\n36:06.380 --> 36:09.500\n to natural language words, what are the ideas here?\n\n36:09.500 --> 36:11.500\n What is the observer and how do we contact it?\n\n36:11.500 --> 36:12.340\n Exactly.\n\n36:12.340 --> 36:14.340\n What's the observer and how do you contact?\n\n36:14.340 --> 36:17.060\n Or if there's other ideas, how to reverse\n\n36:17.060 --> 36:20.620\n the balls getting lost process.\n\n36:20.620 --> 36:22.860\n Yeah, well, you can slow it down.\n\n36:22.860 --> 36:23.700\n Slow it.\n\n36:23.700 --> 36:26.260\n But we found a reset switch recently.\n\n36:26.260 --> 36:31.260\n We just published this in the December 2020 issue of Nature.\n\n36:33.060 --> 36:36.900\n And what we found is that there were three embryonic genes\n\n36:36.900 --> 36:39.780\n that we could put into the adult animal\n\n36:39.780 --> 36:42.020\n to reset the age of the tissues.\n\n36:42.020 --> 36:44.700\n And it only takes four to eight weeks to work well.\n\n36:44.700 --> 36:46.060\n And we can take a blind mouse\n\n36:46.060 --> 36:48.340\n that's lost its vision due to aging.\n\n36:48.340 --> 36:50.460\n Neurons aren't working well towards the brain.\n\n36:50.460 --> 36:52.660\n Reset those neurons back to a younger age.\n\n36:52.660 --> 36:54.220\n And now the mice can see again.\n\n36:55.140 --> 36:57.220\n These three genes are famous actually\n\n36:57.220 --> 36:59.500\n because they're a set of four genes\n\n36:59.500 --> 37:01.700\n discovered by Shinya Yamanaka,\n\n37:01.700 --> 37:04.020\n who won the Nobel Prize in 2016\n\n37:04.020 --> 37:05.900\n for discovering that those four genes\n\n37:05.900 --> 37:09.620\n when turned on at high levels in adult cells\n\n37:09.620 --> 37:11.900\n can generate stem cells.\n\n37:11.900 --> 37:14.060\n And this is, I think, well known now\n\n37:14.060 --> 37:16.900\n that we can create stem cells from adult tissue.\n\n37:16.900 --> 37:19.460\n But what wasn't known is can you partially take age back\n\n37:19.460 --> 37:20.820\n without becoming a tumor\n\n37:20.820 --> 37:22.540\n or generating a stem cell in the eye,\n\n37:22.540 --> 37:24.100\n which would be a disaster?\n\n37:24.100 --> 37:24.940\n And the answer is yes.\n\n37:24.940 --> 37:26.620\n There is a system in the body\n\n37:26.620 --> 37:29.060\n that can take the age of a cell back to a certain point,\n\n37:29.060 --> 37:33.100\n but no further, safely, and reset the age.\n\n37:33.100 --> 37:36.580\n And we're now using that to reset the age of the brain\n\n37:36.580 --> 37:39.340\n of those mice that we aged prematurely.\n\n37:39.340 --> 37:41.700\n And they're getting their ability to learn back.\n\n37:42.580 --> 37:44.300\n This is really exciting, right?\n\n37:44.300 --> 37:46.860\n Like what's the downside of this?\n\n37:46.860 --> 37:49.260\n Well, the downside is if you overdo it\n\n37:49.260 --> 37:52.220\n and you don't get it right, you might cause tumors.\n\n37:53.380 --> 37:54.980\n But we do it very carefully.\n\n37:54.980 --> 37:57.940\n And we also know that in the eye, it's very safe.\n\n37:57.940 --> 38:01.660\n We also injected these, we deliver them by viruses.\n\n38:01.660 --> 38:06.060\n So we can control where and when they get turned on.\n\n38:07.020 --> 38:08.340\n And in this paper, we've published\n\n38:08.340 --> 38:10.580\n that if we put high levels in the mouse,\n\n38:10.580 --> 38:12.420\n into their veins, throughout the body,\n\n38:12.420 --> 38:14.740\n they don't get cancer for over a year.\n\n38:14.740 --> 38:18.660\n So I'm so optimistic that we're going into human studies\n\n38:18.660 --> 38:20.460\n in less than two years from now.\n\n38:20.460 --> 38:23.980\n Is there a place where AI can help?\n\n38:23.980 --> 38:27.740\n Sorry to inject one of the things\n\n38:27.740 --> 38:30.260\n I'm very excited about and passionate about.\n\n38:30.260 --> 38:35.100\n So Google DeepMind recently had a big breakthrough\n\n38:35.100 --> 38:39.140\n with AlphaFold2, but also AlphaFold two years ago,\n\n38:39.140 --> 38:44.140\n with achieving sort of a state of the art performance\n\n38:44.140 --> 38:47.260\n on the protein folding problem, single protein folding.\n\n38:47.260 --> 38:50.300\n But it also paints a hopeful picture\n\n38:50.300 --> 38:52.900\n of what's possible to do in terms of simulating\n\n38:52.900 --> 38:54.180\n the folding of proteins,\n\n38:54.180 --> 38:58.700\n but also simulating biological systems through AI.\n\n38:58.700 --> 39:02.740\n Is there something to you, combined with this brilliant work\n\n39:02.740 --> 39:05.940\n on the biology side that you're hopeful about\n\n39:05.940 --> 39:08.300\n where AI can be a tool to help?\n\n39:08.300 --> 39:09.580\n Where isn't it a tool?\n\n39:09.580 --> 39:11.580\n I mean, if you're not using AI right now in biology,\n\n39:11.580 --> 39:13.100\n you're getting less and less likely\n\n39:13.100 --> 39:15.540\n to be left behind in biology, you're getting left behind.\n\n39:15.540 --> 39:16.380\n We use it all the time.\n\n39:16.380 --> 39:19.340\n We're using it to generate these biological clocks\n\n39:19.340 --> 39:21.940\n to be able to read those scratches.\n\n39:21.940 --> 39:24.700\n We're using it to predict the folding of proteins\n\n39:24.700 --> 39:28.220\n so we can target molecules and modulate their activity.\n\n39:28.220 --> 39:31.420\n We're using it to assemble genomes of different species.\n\n39:31.420 --> 39:32.740\n What else?\n\n39:32.740 --> 39:36.540\n We use it to predict the longevity of a mouse\n\n39:36.540 --> 39:39.180\n based on how it reacts to certain things,\n\n39:39.180 --> 39:41.860\n hearing, eyesight, generally frailty.\n\n39:41.860 --> 39:43.860\n We just put out a paper last year on that.\n\n39:45.660 --> 39:46.900\n The other thing we can use it for,\n\n39:46.900 --> 39:49.100\n which is a little off the track here,\n\n39:49.100 --> 39:51.300\n but we use it for predicting\n\n39:51.300 --> 39:53.300\n which microorganisms are in your body,\n\n39:53.300 --> 39:55.660\n actually not predicting, telling you.\n\n39:55.660 --> 39:59.660\n So our daughter, Natalie, was infected with Lyme disease\n\n39:59.660 --> 40:02.380\n a few years ago, almost went blind from it.\n\n40:02.380 --> 40:03.740\n And the test took four days.\n\n40:03.740 --> 40:06.900\n And I thought, just give me the DNA from her spinal fluid.\n\n40:06.900 --> 40:07.900\n I'll go tell you what's in it.\n\n40:07.900 --> 40:10.060\n If it's Lyme disease or not, they refused.\n\n40:10.060 --> 40:12.580\n And so at that point I said, this has to be done better.\n\n40:12.580 --> 40:15.740\n So I've started a company that now can take a sample\n\n40:15.740 --> 40:17.260\n of any part of your body.\n\n40:17.260 --> 40:21.620\n It's typically done now with liver transplant patients\n\n40:21.620 --> 40:24.900\n to detect viruses that come out of their organs.\n\n40:24.900 --> 40:28.380\n But that's another area that AI is extremely important for.\n\n40:29.340 --> 40:31.460\n I think if you're not, in five years,\n\n40:31.460 --> 40:35.340\n if you're not using deep learning, you've got a problem.\n\n40:35.340 --> 40:36.900\n Because the amount of data that we generate now\n\n40:36.900 --> 40:39.420\n as biologists is just terabytes.\n\n40:39.420 --> 40:40.460\n It can be terabytes per week.\n\n40:40.460 --> 40:42.300\n It'll eventually be terabytes per day.\n\n40:42.300 --> 40:43.940\n And then we just go from there.\n\n40:43.940 --> 40:46.300\n And I actually have trouble recruiting enough\n\n40:46.300 --> 40:47.660\n bioinformaticians.\n\n40:49.020 --> 40:51.260\n A lot of our work is now just number crunching.\n\n40:52.420 --> 40:55.140\n A part of that is collecting the data,\n\n40:55.140 --> 40:57.580\n which is kind of something we've talked a little bit about.\n\n40:57.580 --> 41:00.540\n But is there something you can say about\n\n41:00.540 --> 41:04.460\n how we can collect more and more data,\n\n41:04.460 --> 41:07.580\n not just on the one person level,\n\n41:07.580 --> 41:12.580\n like for you to understand your various markers,\n\n41:13.220 --> 41:16.620\n but to create huge datasets\n\n41:16.620 --> 41:20.460\n to understand how we can detect certain pathogens,\n\n41:20.460 --> 41:22.660\n detect certain properties, characteristics\n\n41:22.660 --> 41:25.580\n of whether it's aging or all the other ways\n\n41:25.580 --> 41:27.140\n that the human body can fail.\n\n41:27.140 --> 41:29.740\n It seems like with biology,\n\n41:29.740 --> 41:33.420\n there's a kind of privacy concerns that,\n\n41:33.420 --> 41:34.940\n well, actually not privacy concerns,\n\n41:34.940 --> 41:38.420\n it's almost like regulation that kind of prevents\n\n41:38.420 --> 41:40.340\n hospitals from sharing data.\n\n41:42.820 --> 41:44.500\n I'm not sure exactly how to say it,\n\n41:44.500 --> 41:48.260\n but it seems like when you look at autonomous vehicles,\n\n41:48.260 --> 41:50.220\n people are much more willing to share data.\n\n41:50.220 --> 41:52.580\n When you look at human biology system,\n\n41:52.580 --> 41:54.380\n people are much less willing to share data.\n\n41:54.380 --> 41:56.860\n Is there a hopeful path forward\n\n41:56.860 --> 42:00.260\n where we can share more and more data at a large scale\n\n42:00.260 --> 42:03.060\n that ultimately ends up helping us understand\n\n42:03.060 --> 42:06.780\n the human body and then treat problems with the human body?\n\n42:06.780 --> 42:08.300\n So we are right in the middle,\n\n42:08.300 --> 42:10.140\n we're living through what's gonna be seen\n\n42:10.140 --> 42:12.620\n as one of the biggest revolutions in human health,\n\n42:12.620 --> 42:16.380\n through the gathering of data about our bodies.\n\n42:16.380 --> 42:19.500\n And 20 years ago, people didn't wanna go on social media,\n\n42:19.500 --> 42:21.300\n they're worried about it, now you have to,\n\n42:21.300 --> 42:23.660\n if you're a kid, that's for sure.\n\n42:23.660 --> 42:25.540\n Same with medical records,\n\n42:25.540 --> 42:28.580\n these are becoming all digitized and expanded.\n\n42:29.420 --> 42:32.580\n Ultimately, we're going to, even if we don't want to,\n\n42:32.580 --> 42:34.780\n have to be monitored.\n\n42:34.780 --> 42:36.980\n There's gonna be a court case that,\n\n42:36.980 --> 42:39.740\n I bet two, three years from now, someone's gonna say,\n\n42:39.740 --> 42:42.380\n how come my father died from a heart attack?\n\n42:42.380 --> 42:45.740\n You had these biosensors, 20 bucks, and you didn't use it.\n\n42:45.740 --> 42:47.460\n Lawsuit right there, and suddenly,\n\n42:47.460 --> 42:49.460\n all hospitals have to give you one of these.\n\n42:49.460 --> 42:51.780\n There'll be a reversal, like to where,\n\n42:52.820 --> 42:54.780\n it's your fault if you don't collect the data,\n\n42:54.780 --> 42:58.140\n that's brilliant, and that's absolutely right.\n\n42:58.140 --> 43:00.780\n I mean, that's absolutely right.\n\n43:00.780 --> 43:03.820\n That's the frustration I feel on going to the doctor,\n\n43:03.820 --> 43:08.820\n is like, it's almost negligent to not collect the data,\n\n43:10.540 --> 43:11.900\n because you're making,\n\n43:11.900 --> 43:13.980\n there's something really wrong with me,\n\n43:13.980 --> 43:17.900\n and you're making decisions based on very few tests,\n\n43:17.900 --> 43:20.100\n that's almost negligent, when you have the opportunity\n\n43:20.100 --> 43:21.980\n to collect a huge amount more data.\n\n43:21.980 --> 43:23.540\n Well, let me tell you something.\n\n43:23.540 --> 43:26.780\n Like, I've got this inside tracker data\n\n43:26.780 --> 43:29.020\n for myself over a decade,\n\n43:29.020 --> 43:31.780\n and you'd think my doctor would roll his eyes at this,\n\n43:31.780 --> 43:34.740\n oh, he's gone to a consumer company, blah, blah, blah.\n\n43:34.740 --> 43:37.340\n I had my first checkup in a year with him\n\n43:37.340 --> 43:42.340\n through video conference, and he was running blind.\n\n43:42.620 --> 43:45.340\n He really didn't know what was going on with me.\n\n43:45.340 --> 43:46.340\n He asked the usual things.\n\n43:46.340 --> 43:47.180\n How am I sleeping?\n\n43:47.180 --> 43:48.540\n How am I eating?\n\n43:48.540 --> 43:50.020\n These kind of usual things.\n\n43:50.020 --> 43:52.300\n And I said, well, I've got new tests back\n\n43:52.300 --> 43:54.380\n from inside tracker, and he said, great,\n\n43:54.380 --> 43:55.860\n I'd love to see them.\n\n43:55.860 --> 43:58.100\n So I share screen, and we look at the graphs,\n\n43:58.100 --> 44:00.820\n look at the data, and he's loving it,\n\n44:00.820 --> 44:04.460\n because he cannot order these tests willy nilly.\n\n44:04.460 --> 44:08.940\n So I said, well, let's order a HbA1c blood glucose levels,\n\n44:08.940 --> 44:10.100\n because I'm very interested in that.\n\n44:10.100 --> 44:11.380\n That tracks with longevity.\n\n44:11.380 --> 44:13.900\n And he said, well, I have no reason to order that.\n\n44:13.900 --> 44:15.460\n Do you have a family history?\n\n44:15.460 --> 44:16.300\n No.\n\n44:17.460 --> 44:18.820\n Do you have any symptoms of diabetes?\n\n44:18.820 --> 44:19.660\n No.\n\n44:19.660 --> 44:20.620\n Well, I can't order the test.\n\n44:20.620 --> 44:22.140\n I almost wanted to reach through the computer\n\n44:22.140 --> 44:25.940\n and strangle him, but instead, I pay a little bit\n\n44:25.940 --> 44:28.260\n to get these tests done, and then he looks at them.\n\n44:28.260 --> 44:30.580\n So that's now the way consumer health is going,\n\n44:30.580 --> 44:32.780\n is that you can get better data than your doctor can,\n\n44:32.780 --> 44:34.460\n but they'd like you to do that.\n\n44:34.460 --> 44:37.460\n Quick human question, maybe you can educate me.\n\n44:39.100 --> 44:42.380\n I think doctors sometimes have a bit of an ego.\n\n44:42.380 --> 44:44.660\n I understand that the doctors super experience\n\n44:44.660 --> 44:47.580\n a lot of things, but this is a fundamental question\n\n44:47.580 --> 44:49.220\n of human variability.\n\n44:49.220 --> 44:52.740\n Like, I know a lot of specific details about like,\n\n44:52.740 --> 44:54.620\n I mean, it depends, of course, what we're talking about,\n\n44:54.620 --> 44:58.420\n but I bring a lot of knowledge, and if I have data with me,\n\n44:58.420 --> 45:02.940\n then I have like several orders of magnitude more knowledge.\n\n45:02.940 --> 45:05.460\n And I think there's an aspect to it where the doctor\n\n45:05.460 --> 45:10.460\n has to put their expert hat, like take it off\n\n45:11.900 --> 45:14.260\n and actually be a curious, open minded person\n\n45:14.260 --> 45:16.500\n and study and look at that data.\n\n45:16.500 --> 45:19.980\n Do you think it's possible to sort of change the culture\n\n45:19.980 --> 45:22.780\n of the medical system to where the doctors are almost,\n\n45:22.780 --> 45:25.700\n as you said, are excited to see the data?\n\n45:25.700 --> 45:26.820\n Or is that already happening?\n\n45:26.820 --> 45:27.660\n It's really happening.\n\n45:27.660 --> 45:30.620\n Now, we've probably lost the last generation.\n\n45:30.620 --> 45:34.500\n They're no hopers, but so I teach at Harvard Medical School\n\n45:34.500 --> 45:35.980\n and they're excited about this.\n\n45:35.980 --> 45:37.140\n They're excited about aging,\n\n45:37.140 --> 45:39.580\n which is a new aspect to medicine.\n\n45:39.580 --> 45:41.660\n Oh, wow, we can do something about that.\n\n45:41.660 --> 45:43.900\n And then, yeah, all this data, what do we do with it?\n\n45:43.900 --> 45:45.900\n There's still the traditional pathology and all that stuff,\n\n45:45.900 --> 45:52.900\n which they need to know, but time will change their mindset.\n\n45:52.900 --> 45:54.300\n I'm not worried about that.\n\n45:54.300 --> 45:57.340\n And like we were discussing, this isn't a question of if,\n\n45:57.340 --> 45:58.980\n it's just a matter of when.\n\n45:58.980 --> 46:02.260\n And I have a front row seat on all of this.\n\n46:02.260 --> 46:07.420\n I had breakfast with a CEO who is making this happen\n\n46:07.420 --> 46:09.540\n just yesterday.\n\n46:09.540 --> 46:12.740\n I can tell you for sure that most people have no idea\n\n46:12.740 --> 46:14.580\n that this revolution is occurring\n\n46:14.580 --> 46:17.220\n and is happening so quickly.\n\n46:17.220 --> 46:19.780\n If you're running a hospital and you can save $2,000\n\n46:19.780 --> 46:22.380\n per cardiac patient, what are you going to do?\n\n46:22.380 --> 46:23.340\n You have to use it.\n\n46:23.340 --> 46:25.540\n Otherwise, the hospital down the road\n\n46:25.540 --> 46:28.380\n is going to be beating you.\n\n46:28.380 --> 46:30.820\n And there are large hospital aggregations,\n\n46:30.820 --> 46:32.860\n so there's Ascension and others,\n\n46:32.860 --> 46:37.500\n that just have to go this way for budgetary reasons.\n\n46:37.500 --> 46:43.660\n And right now, the US spends 17% of their GDP on healthcare.\n\n46:43.660 --> 46:45.860\n Let's say one of these buttons on my chest costs $20.\n\n46:45.860 --> 46:47.220\n It's rechargeable.\n\n46:47.220 --> 46:48.620\n And it can predict people's health\n\n46:48.620 --> 46:52.820\n and save on antibiotics to prevent heart attacks.\n\n46:52.820 --> 46:54.940\n How many billions, if not trillions of dollars,\n\n46:54.940 --> 46:58.380\n will that save over the next decade?\n\n46:58.380 --> 47:00.220\n Yeah, so when the public wakes up to this,\n\n47:00.220 --> 47:01.460\n they'll almost demand it.\n\n47:01.460 --> 47:04.020\n Like, this should be accepted everywhere.\n\n47:04.020 --> 47:04.980\n This is obvious.\n\n47:04.980 --> 47:05.980\n It's going to save a lot of money.\n\n47:05.980 --> 47:07.620\n It's going to improve the quality of life.\n\n47:07.620 --> 47:11.460\n Well, and the CFOs of hospital groups will have to.\n\n47:11.460 --> 47:15.700\n And insurance companies are going to want to get in on this.\n\n47:15.700 --> 47:17.620\n So now that gets to privacy, right?\n\n47:17.620 --> 47:20.460\n Should an insurance company have access to your data?\n\n47:20.460 --> 47:21.700\n I would say no.\n\n47:21.700 --> 47:24.100\n But you could voluntarily show them some of it\n\n47:24.100 --> 47:25.500\n if they give you a discount.\n\n47:25.500 --> 47:28.980\n And that's also being worked on right now.\n\n47:28.980 --> 47:30.900\n I hope we do create kind of systems\n\n47:30.900 --> 47:33.180\n where I can volunteer to share my data\n\n47:33.180 --> 47:35.780\n and I can also take the data back,\n\n47:35.780 --> 47:39.060\n meaning like delete the data, request deletion of data.\n\n47:39.060 --> 47:41.460\n And then maybe policy creates rules\n\n47:41.460 --> 47:45.020\n to where you can share data, you could delete the data.\n\n47:45.020 --> 47:50.020\n And I think if I have the option to delete all my data\n\n47:50.700 --> 47:52.700\n that a particular company has,\n\n47:52.700 --> 47:54.500\n then I'll share my data with everyone.\n\n47:55.900 --> 48:00.900\n I feel like if, because that gives me the tools\n\n48:01.340 --> 48:04.580\n to be a consumer, an intelligent consumer,\n\n48:04.580 --> 48:08.700\n of awarding my data to a company that deserves it\n\n48:08.700 --> 48:11.260\n and taking it back when the company is misbehaving.\n\n48:11.260 --> 48:13.460\n And in that way, encourage,\n\n48:13.460 --> 48:15.780\n as a consumer in the capitalist system,\n\n48:15.780 --> 48:18.740\n encourage the companies that are doing great work\n\n48:18.740 --> 48:20.300\n with that data.\n\n48:20.300 --> 48:24.220\n Well, yeah, healthcare data security is number one.\n\n48:24.220 --> 48:27.780\n On my mind, InsideTracker made sure that that was true.\n\n48:27.780 --> 48:31.180\n But these buttons on your chest,\n\n48:31.180 --> 48:33.740\n there's very private stuff they can probably tell\n\n48:33.740 --> 48:35.580\n if you're having sex one night, right?\n\n48:35.580 --> 48:37.860\n So this is not the kind of stuff you want leaked.\n\n48:37.860 --> 48:39.580\n So I don't know whether it's blockchain or something.\n\n48:39.580 --> 48:40.420\n Speak for yourself.\n\n48:40.420 --> 48:41.580\n I want this public.\n\n48:41.580 --> 48:43.540\n The live stream.\n\n48:43.540 --> 48:45.660\n I guess it depends on how you go.\n\n48:45.660 --> 48:48.980\n But there's a lot of stuff you don't want out there.\n\n48:48.980 --> 48:51.620\n And this definitely has to be number one\n\n48:51.620 --> 48:54.500\n because it's one thing to have your credit card\n\n48:54.500 --> 48:55.860\n information stolen, it's another thing\n\n48:55.860 --> 48:57.740\n your health records are permanently out there.\n\n48:57.740 --> 48:58.580\n Yeah.\n\n48:58.580 --> 48:59.860\n So there's, on the biology side,\n\n48:59.860 --> 49:03.620\n super exciting ways to slow aging.\n\n49:03.620 --> 49:05.580\n But there's also on the lifestyle side.\n\n49:05.580 --> 49:08.060\n I recently did a 72 hour fast.\n\n49:08.060 --> 49:09.420\n It's just an opportunity to take a pause\n\n49:09.420 --> 49:11.700\n and appreciate life.\n\n49:12.540 --> 49:14.380\n Think about, there's something about fasting\n\n49:14.380 --> 49:19.300\n that encourages you to reflect deeper\n\n49:19.300 --> 49:21.060\n than you otherwise might.\n\n49:22.060 --> 49:24.060\n The time kind of slows.\n\n49:24.060 --> 49:25.980\n And you also realize that you're human\n\n49:25.980 --> 49:27.340\n because your body needs food.\n\n49:27.340 --> 49:30.580\n And you start to see your body's almost as a machine\n\n49:30.580 --> 49:33.660\n that takes food and produces thoughts.\n\n49:33.660 --> 49:36.860\n And then ends briefly.\n\n49:36.860 --> 49:39.940\n I mean, you start to, depending who you are,\n\n49:39.940 --> 49:41.700\n if you're like engineering minded,\n\n49:41.700 --> 49:43.580\n you start to think of this whole thing\n\n49:43.580 --> 49:46.100\n as a kind of, yeah, as a machine.\n\n49:46.100 --> 49:50.860\n And then also feelings fill this machine.\n\n49:50.860 --> 49:52.460\n Feelings of gratitude, of love,\n\n49:52.460 --> 49:56.580\n but also the uglier things of jealousy\n\n49:56.580 --> 49:59.660\n and greed and hate and all those kinds of things.\n\n49:59.660 --> 50:04.540\n You start to think, okay, how do I manage this body\n\n50:04.540 --> 50:06.140\n to create a rich experience?\n\n50:06.140 --> 50:07.740\n All of that comes from fasting for me.\n\n50:07.740 --> 50:11.740\n Anyway, but there's also health benefits to fasting.\n\n50:11.740 --> 50:13.340\n I intermittent fast a lot.\n\n50:13.340 --> 50:16.580\n I eat just one meal a day most of the time.\n\n50:16.580 --> 50:18.180\n Is there something you could say\n\n50:18.180 --> 50:20.460\n about the benefits of fasting in your own life\n\n50:20.460 --> 50:23.460\n and in general the anti aging process?\n\n50:23.460 --> 50:25.540\n Well, you're a philosopher too.\n\n50:25.540 --> 50:26.860\n Sorry, I apologize.\n\n50:26.860 --> 50:28.420\n No, I'm impressed.\n\n50:28.420 --> 50:30.340\n True Renaissance man.\n\n50:30.340 --> 50:31.900\n It's a joy to be here.\n\n50:31.900 --> 50:34.060\n So when it comes to fasting, this is,\n\n50:34.060 --> 50:37.140\n being abstemious is one of the oldest ways\n\n50:37.140 --> 50:38.420\n to improve health.\n\n50:38.420 --> 50:41.540\n Probably they knew this 5,000 plus years ago.\n\n50:41.540 --> 50:43.100\n So that's not new.\n\n50:43.100 --> 50:45.580\n But what we're figuring out is what is optimal\n\n50:45.580 --> 50:47.020\n and how does it work?\n\n50:47.020 --> 50:49.500\n And one of the things we help contribute to,\n\n50:49.500 --> 50:51.780\n which I can speak to with some authority\n\n50:51.780 --> 50:54.380\n is that these longevity genes we work on,\n\n50:54.380 --> 50:56.340\n we showed back in the early 2000s\n\n50:56.340 --> 50:58.580\n are turned on by fasting.\n\n50:58.580 --> 51:01.140\n And at least in yeast, we were the first to show\n\n51:01.140 --> 51:03.260\n that how calorie restriction fasting works\n\n51:03.260 --> 51:04.460\n to extend lifespan.\n\n51:04.460 --> 51:06.420\n And that was the first for any species.\n\n51:06.420 --> 51:08.180\n Something similar happens in our bodies.\n\n51:08.180 --> 51:10.500\n When we're hungry or put our bodies\n\n51:10.500 --> 51:12.620\n under any other perceived adversity,\n\n51:12.620 --> 51:14.660\n such as running, our bodies think,\n\n51:14.660 --> 51:18.420\n wow, we're getting chased by a saber tooth cat or something.\n\n51:19.500 --> 51:22.420\n If we're really hot or cold, these probably also work.\n\n51:22.420 --> 51:24.740\n To put our bodies in this defensive state,\n\n51:24.740 --> 51:27.140\n to activate these genes in the way that whales do\n\n51:27.140 --> 51:28.580\n and mice don't.\n\n51:28.580 --> 51:31.300\n And so hunger is the best way to do that.\n\n51:31.300 --> 51:33.700\n In fact, I don't think you have to feel hungry.\n\n51:33.700 --> 51:35.300\n You can get used to it.\n\n51:35.300 --> 51:37.180\n But if there was one thing I would recommend\n\n51:37.180 --> 51:39.500\n to anybody to slow down aging\n\n51:39.500 --> 51:42.820\n would be to skip a meal or two a day.\n\n51:42.820 --> 51:44.420\n Now it doesn't mean you don't have to live well.\n\n51:44.420 --> 51:45.260\n You can go out.\n\n51:45.260 --> 51:47.660\n I go to restaurants, I eat regular food.\n\n51:47.660 --> 51:49.980\n I try to be as healthy as possible.\n\n51:49.980 --> 51:53.340\n But I've gone from skipping breakfast most of my life\n\n51:53.340 --> 51:55.420\n now just skipping lunch as well.\n\n51:55.420 --> 51:59.260\n And I have my physique back that I had when I was 20.\n\n51:59.260 --> 52:01.220\n I feel 20 mentally.\n\n52:01.220 --> 52:02.460\n I'm much sharper.\n\n52:02.460 --> 52:03.460\n I don't feel tired anymore.\n\n52:03.460 --> 52:04.620\n I sleep well.\n\n52:04.620 --> 52:07.340\n So I'm a huge fan of the one meal a day thing.\n\n52:07.340 --> 52:11.100\n Where I'm not good at is going beyond one day.\n\n52:11.100 --> 52:11.940\n But if you do three days.\n\n52:11.940 --> 52:15.580\n Have you ever fasted longer than 24 hours?\n\n52:15.580 --> 52:17.100\n I tried doing two days.\n\n52:17.100 --> 52:20.140\n I might have made it to the third and given up.\n\n52:20.140 --> 52:22.780\n I just find that I'm not very,\n\n52:22.780 --> 52:23.820\n I don't have a lot of willpower.\n\n52:23.820 --> 52:24.900\n I also hate exercise.\n\n52:24.900 --> 52:27.940\n So I'm not sure how long I'm gonna live.\n\n52:27.940 --> 52:29.140\n But I've managed to do one meal a day.\n\n52:29.140 --> 52:31.980\n So if I can do that, seriously, anybody can do that.\n\n52:33.060 --> 52:35.980\n To your listeners and viewers, I would say,\n\n52:35.980 --> 52:38.100\n don't try to do it all at once.\n\n52:38.100 --> 52:40.700\n You can't go from snacking and eating three meals a day\n\n52:40.700 --> 52:42.820\n to what I do easily.\n\n52:42.820 --> 52:45.580\n Work your way up to it, but also compensate with drinking.\n\n52:45.580 --> 52:48.860\n If you like tea, if you like coffee, put some milk in it.\n\n52:48.860 --> 52:49.700\n That's fine.\n\n52:49.700 --> 52:52.340\n You can fill your stomach up with liquids,\n\n52:52.340 --> 52:54.180\n diet sodas, I get criticized for drinking,\n\n52:54.180 --> 52:56.540\n but I'm gonna continue to have those.\n\n52:56.540 --> 52:58.260\n But then I power through the day.\n\n52:58.260 --> 52:59.740\n I definitely don't feel tired.\n\n52:59.740 --> 53:00.860\n I don't have a lag anymore.\n\n53:00.860 --> 53:02.660\n But also give it at least two weeks\n\n53:02.660 --> 53:04.900\n because there's a habit as well.\n\n53:04.900 --> 53:06.540\n Having something in your mouth, chewing,\n\n53:06.540 --> 53:09.500\n feeling that fullness, you can break that habit.\n\n53:09.500 --> 53:12.060\n And within two, three weeks, you'll have done it.\n\n53:12.060 --> 53:12.900\n Absolutely.\n\n53:12.900 --> 53:14.500\n So I'm not actually even that strict about it.\n\n53:14.500 --> 53:15.940\n You said diet soda.\n\n53:15.940 --> 53:18.500\n Yeah, people are very kind of weirdly strict\n\n53:18.500 --> 53:20.860\n about fasting, the rules in fasting.\n\n53:20.860 --> 53:25.620\n Like for example, I drank Element electrolytes\n\n53:25.620 --> 53:28.380\n when I was fasting, and that has like five calories.\n\n53:28.380 --> 53:31.220\n And so technically it's not fasting.\n\n53:31.220 --> 53:33.700\n Or people will say like, if you drink coffee,\n\n53:33.700 --> 53:35.440\n there's caffeine, and they'll say\n\n53:35.440 --> 53:36.940\n that's technically not fasting\n\n53:36.940 --> 53:38.700\n because there's some kind of biological effects\n\n53:38.700 --> 53:40.300\n of caffeine, but whatever.\n\n53:40.300 --> 53:42.420\n Of course, there's like biological benefits\n\n53:42.420 --> 53:43.540\n that you can argue about,\n\n53:43.540 --> 53:45.980\n but there's also just experiential benefits.\n\n53:45.980 --> 53:49.980\n Just calorie restriction broadly has a certain experience\n\n53:49.980 --> 53:52.420\n to it that, like for me personally,\n\n53:52.420 --> 53:55.180\n just as you said, has made me feel really good.\n\n53:55.180 --> 54:00.020\n That said, especially, I've gained quite a bit of weight,\n\n54:01.380 --> 54:03.340\n maybe even like 15 pounds, something like that,\n\n54:03.340 --> 54:05.660\n since I moved to Austin, Texas.\n\n54:05.660 --> 54:08.500\n And I still keep the same diet,\n\n54:08.500 --> 54:12.840\n but I eat a lot of meat in that one,\n\n54:12.840 --> 54:14.060\n just because it's delicious,\n\n54:14.060 --> 54:19.060\n because it's also the amazing people I met in Texas.\n\n54:19.060 --> 54:21.700\n It's just there's like a camaraderie,\n\n54:21.700 --> 54:23.420\n a friendship, a love to the people\n\n54:23.420 --> 54:25.660\n that like makes you really enjoy\n\n54:25.660 --> 54:29.300\n the atmosphere of eating the brisket and the meat.\n\n54:29.300 --> 54:31.060\n Is this Joe Rogan insisting?\n\n54:31.060 --> 54:33.620\n Joe is, I mean, he's very different.\n\n54:34.660 --> 54:38.660\n Joe loves bread and pasta.\n\n54:38.660 --> 54:42.180\n Like he knows that his body feels best\n\n54:42.180 --> 54:44.220\n doing keto or carnivore.\n\n54:44.220 --> 54:47.420\n So that's what he usually tries to stick to,\n\n54:47.420 --> 54:50.100\n but he also does not hold back,\n\n54:50.100 --> 54:52.660\n and he'll just eat pasta when he eats pasta,\n\n54:52.660 --> 54:55.100\n and he sort of enjoys life in that way.\n\n54:55.100 --> 54:57.820\n I can't, I don't know how to enjoy life in that way.\n\n54:57.820 --> 55:01.780\n I also love pasta, but I'm just not going to enjoy it,\n\n55:01.780 --> 55:05.740\n because I know my body ultimately\n\n55:05.740 --> 55:06.980\n does not feel good with pasta.\n\n55:06.980 --> 55:09.340\n So it's a funny kind of dichotomies.\n\n55:09.340 --> 55:13.740\n I would like to cheat, I guess,\n\n55:13.740 --> 55:18.580\n by eating more meat than I, you know, like overeating\n\n55:19.620 --> 55:22.300\n on the things that I know my body feels good on\n\n55:22.300 --> 55:24.260\n as opposed to eating stuff I shouldn't,\n\n55:24.260 --> 55:26.380\n like cake and all those kinds of things.\n\n55:26.380 --> 55:31.380\n I tend to find happiness in overeating the good stuff\n\n55:32.460 --> 55:35.940\n versus eating the bad stuff.\n\n55:35.940 --> 55:37.660\n And that's the kind of balance.\n\n55:37.660 --> 55:40.100\n Him, he's like, fuck it.\n\n55:41.060 --> 55:43.380\n Every once in a while, you gotta enjoy it.\n\n55:43.380 --> 55:46.180\n And then also coupled with that for him\n\n55:47.060 --> 55:51.100\n is just exercise, like then face his demons the next day\n\n55:51.100 --> 55:53.540\n and just like burn a huge amount of calories,\n\n55:53.540 --> 55:58.540\n which is, I mean, whatever's up with that guy's mind,\n\n55:58.860 --> 56:03.780\n there's an, there's a ability to fully experience life,\n\n56:03.780 --> 56:05.980\n which is represented by the pasta,\n\n56:05.980 --> 56:09.180\n and the ability to just like fight the demons,\n\n56:09.180 --> 56:11.380\n which is represented by all the crazy kettle balls\n\n56:11.380 --> 56:13.900\n and running the hills and all this kind of stuff\n\n56:13.900 --> 56:14.740\n that he does.\n\n56:14.740 --> 56:16.260\n That takes a lot out of you doing\n\n56:16.260 --> 56:17.540\n that kind of insane exercise.\n\n56:17.540 --> 56:20.420\n And I think I'm more like you,\n\n56:20.420 --> 56:22.500\n or at least towards your direction is like,\n\n56:22.500 --> 56:24.420\n I really hate exercise.\n\n56:24.420 --> 56:26.820\n So I do it, but I really hate it.\n\n56:26.820 --> 56:29.620\n And so it's a balance that you have to strike.\n\n56:29.620 --> 56:33.460\n Is there something you could say about the diet side of that\n\n56:33.460 --> 56:35.980\n for you personally, but in general,\n\n56:36.980 --> 56:39.780\n in order to achieve calorie restriction,\n\n56:39.780 --> 56:43.940\n like for me, eating, I know it may not sound healthy,\n\n56:43.940 --> 56:47.820\n but eating carnivore, eating mostly meat\n\n56:47.820 --> 56:50.060\n has been, has made me feel really good,\n\n56:50.060 --> 56:52.820\n both mentally and physically.\n\n56:52.820 --> 56:56.220\n Is there something you could say about the kinds of diets\n\n56:56.220 --> 56:57.740\n that may improve longevity,\n\n56:57.740 --> 57:01.140\n but also enable calorie restriction?\n\n57:01.140 --> 57:01.980\n Well, sure.\n\n57:02.820 --> 57:04.540\n I mean, the first thing that's important to know\n\n57:04.540 --> 57:08.700\n is that while many people are interested slash obsessed\n\n57:08.700 --> 57:11.220\n with what they eat,\n\n57:11.220 --> 57:13.620\n the data that's come out of animal studies at least\n\n57:13.620 --> 57:17.300\n is it's far more important when you eat than what you eat.\n\n57:17.300 --> 57:20.140\n And this was a fantastic study a few years ago\n\n57:20.140 --> 57:22.020\n by my friend, Rafael de Cabo\n\n57:22.020 --> 57:24.700\n at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda.\n\n57:24.700 --> 57:26.900\n And he had 10,000 mice on different diets,\n\n57:26.900 --> 57:30.980\n hoping to find the perfect mix of carbs, protein, and fat.\n\n57:30.980 --> 57:33.260\n And it turns out that the only ones that lived longer\n\n57:33.260 --> 57:35.860\n are the ones that only ate once a day.\n\n57:35.860 --> 57:37.940\n And so that, if we're not mice,\n\n57:37.940 --> 57:40.300\n but I think that we're close enough to mice\n\n57:40.300 --> 57:42.620\n that this tells us a lot.\n\n57:42.620 --> 57:44.900\n But okay, but I still think the best bang\n\n57:44.900 --> 57:47.820\n for the longevity buck is to do both well,\n\n57:47.820 --> 57:51.580\n eat less often and eat the right things.\n\n57:51.580 --> 57:54.340\n Now I'll preface this to say, I'm not a nut about this.\n\n57:54.340 --> 57:57.940\n I will eat occasional, very occasionally a dessert.\n\n57:57.940 --> 58:00.860\n Usually I steal from others, which doesn't count, right?\n\n58:00.860 --> 58:01.700\n Exactly.\n\n58:01.700 --> 58:02.660\n But you gotta live life, right?\n\n58:02.660 --> 58:05.460\n What's a long life if it's not enjoyable anyway?\n\n58:05.460 --> 58:08.100\n But what I also found, and this is,\n\n58:08.100 --> 58:09.220\n I'll get to your question in a second,\n\n58:09.220 --> 58:12.540\n but my microbiome right now and stomach is at a point\n\n58:12.540 --> 58:15.700\n where if I try to overeat on a steak,\n\n58:15.700 --> 58:16.900\n which I did a couple of days ago,\n\n58:16.900 --> 58:21.900\n I actually had a chicken, a fried chicken specifically,\n\n58:22.260 --> 58:23.860\n for two days, I felt terrible.\n\n58:23.860 --> 58:26.020\n I couldn't sleep, it wouldn't go down.\n\n58:26.020 --> 58:28.260\n So I'm now at a point where even if I want to binge\n\n58:28.260 --> 58:31.620\n on meat and fried foods, I just can't, it just feels bad.\n\n58:32.780 --> 58:34.260\n But what do I recommend?\n\n58:34.260 --> 58:37.020\n Well, what the data says, which I try to follow,\n\n58:37.020 --> 58:40.340\n is that plant based foods will be better\n\n58:40.340 --> 58:41.300\n than meat based foods.\n\n58:41.300 --> 58:43.900\n And I know that there are a lot of people who disagree.\n\n58:43.900 --> 58:46.220\n But one of the facts is, well, there's a few facts.\n\n58:46.220 --> 58:47.620\n One is that people who live a long time\n\n58:47.620 --> 58:48.780\n tend to eat those type of diets.\n\n58:48.780 --> 58:51.020\n Mediterranean, Okinawa diet,\n\n58:51.020 --> 58:53.940\n they're eating mostly plants with a little bit of meat\n\n58:53.940 --> 58:55.940\n and not a lot of red meat.\n\n58:55.940 --> 58:58.580\n And the other fact is that in animals we know\n\n58:58.580 --> 59:01.340\n that there's a mechanism that's called mTOR,\n\n59:01.340 --> 59:05.420\n little m, capital TOR, that responds to certain amino acids\n\n59:05.420 --> 59:07.620\n that are found in more abundance in meat.\n\n59:07.620 --> 59:10.260\n And when it responds, it actually shortens lifespan.\n\n59:10.260 --> 59:11.540\n And the converse, if you starve it\n\n59:11.540 --> 59:15.820\n of those three amino acids, mostly in meat,\n\n59:15.820 --> 59:17.540\n then it extends lifespan.\n\n59:17.540 --> 59:19.460\n And there's a drug called rapamycin,\n\n59:19.460 --> 59:22.740\n which some people are experimenting with, that does that.\n\n59:22.740 --> 59:25.540\n So you might be able to, I'm just saying this here\n\n59:25.540 --> 59:27.660\n from all my colleagues, we don't know the results here,\n\n59:27.660 --> 59:30.660\n but you could potentially take a rapamycin like drug\n\n59:30.660 --> 59:34.260\n and counteract the effects of meat in the long run.\n\n59:34.260 --> 59:35.820\n Dono, we should try that actually,\n\n59:35.820 --> 59:37.300\n we could do that in the lab.\n\n59:37.300 --> 59:39.340\n But getting to the bottom of this,\n\n59:39.340 --> 59:41.220\n what I think is going on is that\n\n59:41.220 --> 59:42.900\n just like testosterone and growth hormone,\n\n59:42.900 --> 59:47.100\n you will get temporary, maybe not temporary,\n\n59:47.100 --> 59:48.580\n immediate health benefits.\n\n59:48.580 --> 59:51.900\n You'll feel great, you'll get more muscle energy.\n\n59:51.900 --> 59:54.300\n But the problem is I think it's at the expense\n\n59:54.300 --> 59:56.140\n of longterm health and longevity.\n\n59:56.140 --> 1:00:00.460\n Well, this is actually something I worry about\n\n1:00:00.460 --> 1:00:05.020\n in terms of longterm effects or the cost\n\n1:00:05.020 --> 1:00:05.900\n in terms of longevity.\n\n1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:08.060\n It's very difficult to know how your choices\n\n1:00:08.060 --> 1:00:12.780\n affect your longevity because the impact is down the line.\n\n1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:17.780\n Like just because something makes me feel good now,\n\n1:00:17.780 --> 1:00:20.420\n like eating only meat makes me feel good now,\n\n1:00:20.420 --> 1:00:22.420\n I wonder what are the costs down the line.\n\n1:00:22.420 --> 1:00:24.940\n Well, think about what I was saying about the trade offs\n\n1:00:24.940 --> 1:00:27.220\n between growth and reproduction,\n\n1:00:27.220 --> 1:00:29.300\n which is what a mouse does and a whale\n\n1:00:29.300 --> 1:00:33.060\n that grows slowly, reproduces slowly, lives a long time.\n\n1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:35.060\n It's called the disposable soma theory.\n\n1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:38.780\n Koch would just propose that in the 70s.\n\n1:00:38.780 --> 1:00:42.140\n What meat probably does is put you in the mouse category,\n\n1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:44.780\n super fertile, grow fast, heal fast.\n\n1:00:44.780 --> 1:00:46.660\n And then if you wanna be a whale,\n\n1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:49.660\n you should restrict meat and do things\n\n1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:53.380\n that promote the preservation of your body.\n\n1:00:53.380 --> 1:00:57.820\n Is it difficult to eat a plant based diet\n\n1:00:57.820 --> 1:01:00.020\n that you perform well under?\n\n1:01:00.020 --> 1:01:02.860\n So mentally and physically, just almost,\n\n1:01:02.860 --> 1:01:06.860\n I'm asking almost like an anecdotal question\n\n1:01:06.860 --> 1:01:08.380\n or unless you know the science.\n\n1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:12.140\n Well, the science is still being worked out,\n\n1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:15.180\n but from the synthesis of everything that I've read,\n\n1:01:15.180 --> 1:01:20.140\n I try to eat a diet that's definitely full of leafy greens,\n\n1:01:21.180 --> 1:01:22.580\n particularly spinach is great\n\n1:01:22.580 --> 1:01:25.860\n because it's got the iron that we need, plenty of vitamins.\n\n1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:30.860\n I also try to avoid too much fruit and berries,\n\n1:01:32.420 --> 1:01:34.020\n particularly fruit juice,\n\n1:01:34.020 --> 1:01:35.900\n definitely avoid that sugar high.\n\n1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:39.900\n Spiking your sugar is not healthy in the long run.\n\n1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:40.940\n The other thing that's interesting\n\n1:01:40.940 --> 1:01:45.500\n is we discovered what we called xenohormetic molecules.\n\n1:01:45.500 --> 1:01:47.580\n Let me unpack that because it's a terrible name\n\n1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:49.460\n and I take full responsibility\n\n1:01:49.460 --> 1:01:51.740\n with my friend, Conrad Howards.\n\n1:01:51.740 --> 1:01:53.900\n The Xeno means cross species\n\n1:01:53.900 --> 1:01:57.380\n and hormesis is the term that what doesn't kill you\n\n1:01:57.380 --> 1:02:01.180\n makes you live longer and be healthier.\n\n1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:04.620\n And so we're getting cross species health improvements\n\n1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:06.940\n by molecules that plants make.\n\n1:02:06.940 --> 1:02:08.220\n And plants make these molecules\n\n1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:11.780\n when they're also under adversity or perceived adversity.\n\n1:02:11.780 --> 1:02:14.140\n For instance, I understand\n\n1:02:14.140 --> 1:02:16.700\n if you want really healthy, good oranges,\n\n1:02:16.700 --> 1:02:19.340\n you can drive nails into the bark of the tree\n\n1:02:19.340 --> 1:02:20.380\n before you harvest.\n\n1:02:20.380 --> 1:02:23.220\n Same with wine, you typically want them to be dry\n\n1:02:23.220 --> 1:02:25.940\n before you harvest or covered in fungus.\n\n1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:28.820\n And that's because these plants make these colorful\n\n1:02:28.820 --> 1:02:30.700\n and xenohormetic molecules\n\n1:02:30.700 --> 1:02:33.380\n that make themselves stress resistant,\n\n1:02:33.380 --> 1:02:37.700\n turn on their sirtuin defenses, the serogenes remember.\n\n1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.300\n And when we eat them, we get those same benefits.\n\n1:02:40.300 --> 1:02:42.220\n That's the idea and we've evolved to do so.\n\n1:02:42.220 --> 1:02:43.700\n This isn't a coincidence.\n\n1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:47.020\n It's my theory, our theory that we want to know\n\n1:02:47.020 --> 1:02:49.220\n when our food supply is under adversity\n\n1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:51.980\n because we need to get ready for a famine.\n\n1:02:51.980 --> 1:02:54.580\n And so we hunker down and preserve our body\n\n1:02:54.580 --> 1:02:55.860\n and by eating these colored foods,\n\n1:02:55.860 --> 1:02:58.780\n so practically speaking, if it's full of color\n\n1:02:58.780 --> 1:03:01.900\n or if there's been some chewing by a caterpillar,\n\n1:03:01.900 --> 1:03:04.980\n organic, grown locally in local farms,\n\n1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:09.980\n I'll eat that versus a watery, insipid, light colored lettuce\n\n1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:12.780\n that's been grown in California.\n\n1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:14.540\n So you want vegetables that have suffered.\n\n1:03:14.540 --> 1:03:16.700\n You want the David Goggins as a vegetables.\n\n1:03:16.700 --> 1:03:19.300\n That's the xenohormetic molecules.\n\n1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:20.780\n I love that term.\n\n1:03:20.780 --> 1:03:23.300\n I'm gonna take that one with me, thank you.\n\n1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:24.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:03:24.980 --> 1:03:27.380\n Oh, I follow him on Instagram, he's always screaming.\n\n1:03:27.380 --> 1:03:29.900\n So you want that he's basically\n\n1:03:30.940 --> 1:03:34.860\n the xenohormetic version of a human.\n\n1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:36.900\n I like it.\n\n1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:38.980\n So these are the molecules that are representative\n\n1:03:38.980 --> 1:03:43.980\n of the stress that a plant has been under.\n\n1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:46.660\n Yeah, the best example of that is resveratrol,\n\n1:03:46.660 --> 1:03:48.140\n which many people, including myself,\n\n1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:49.660\n take as a supplement.\n\n1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:52.660\n Grapes, grapevines produce that in abundance\n\n1:03:52.660 --> 1:03:55.780\n when they're dried out or they have too much light\n\n1:03:55.780 --> 1:03:59.060\n or fungus and that we've shown activates\n\n1:03:59.060 --> 1:04:01.500\n the Sertu enzyme in our bodies,\n\n1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:03.780\n which remember is what extends lifespan in yeast\n\n1:04:03.780 --> 1:04:05.780\n and slows down aging in the brain.\n\n1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:06.900\n That's beautiful.\n\n1:04:06.900 --> 1:04:09.260\n Yeah, I tend to avoid fruit as well.\n\n1:04:09.260 --> 1:04:12.660\n So green, veggies, anything that's not very sweet.\n\n1:04:12.660 --> 1:04:15.420\n So I would just say you're relatively low,\n\n1:04:15.420 --> 1:04:19.140\n like you try to avoid sugary things as well.\n\n1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:21.500\n Yeah, I'm fairly militant about that.\n\n1:04:21.500 --> 1:04:23.900\n I rarely would add sugar to anything.\n\n1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:27.820\n Occasionally I would eat a slice of cheesecake,\n\n1:04:27.820 --> 1:04:31.060\n but that would be maybe once or twice a year.\n\n1:04:31.060 --> 1:04:32.900\n You have to give in occasionally.\n\n1:04:32.900 --> 1:04:34.780\n But yeah, anything that's sweet,\n\n1:04:34.780 --> 1:04:37.460\n I would rather substitute something like Stevia\n\n1:04:37.460 --> 1:04:38.620\n if I need a sugar hit.\n\n1:04:40.820 --> 1:04:42.420\n What about exercise?\n\n1:04:42.420 --> 1:04:43.620\n Your favorite topic.\n\n1:04:45.260 --> 1:04:46.660\n Is there a part?\n\n1:04:46.660 --> 1:04:48.500\n I don't mind talking about it.\n\n1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:49.340\n Okay, great.\n\n1:04:49.340 --> 1:04:53.460\n Is there benefits to longevity from exercise?\n\n1:04:53.460 --> 1:04:55.940\n Well, no doubt, that's proven.\n\n1:04:55.940 --> 1:04:59.180\n Just like fasting, it's pretty clear that that works.\n\n1:04:59.180 --> 1:05:01.860\n For example, there are studies of cyclists.\n\n1:05:01.860 --> 1:05:04.180\n It was something like people that cycle\n\n1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:07.660\n over 80 miles a week have a 40% reduction\n\n1:05:07.660 --> 1:05:10.380\n in a variety of diseases, certainly heart disease.\n\n1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:11.580\n So that's not even a question,\n\n1:05:11.580 --> 1:05:13.460\n but what's interesting is that we're learning\n\n1:05:13.460 --> 1:05:15.620\n that you don't need much to have a big benefit.\n\n1:05:15.620 --> 1:05:17.420\n It's an asymptotic curve.\n\n1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:19.140\n And in fact, if you overdo it,\n\n1:05:19.140 --> 1:05:20.620\n you probably have reduced benefits,\n\n1:05:20.620 --> 1:05:22.140\n particularly if you start to wear out joints,\n\n1:05:22.140 --> 1:05:23.460\n that kind of thing.\n\n1:05:23.460 --> 1:05:26.300\n But just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few times a week,\n\n1:05:26.300 --> 1:05:28.540\n lose your breath, get hypoxic, as it's called,\n\n1:05:28.540 --> 1:05:32.620\n seems to be very beneficial for longterm health.\n\n1:05:32.620 --> 1:05:36.420\n And that's the kind of exercise that I like to do, aerobic.\n\n1:05:36.420 --> 1:05:38.460\n Though I do enjoy lifting weights,\n\n1:05:38.460 --> 1:05:40.860\n so that is what I call my exercise,\n\n1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:41.820\n which has other benefits,\n\n1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:46.180\n including maintaining hormone levels, male hormone levels.\n\n1:05:46.180 --> 1:05:49.860\n But also really why I do it is I want to be able\n\n1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:53.460\n to counteract the effects of sitting for most of the day.\n\n1:05:53.460 --> 1:05:55.740\n And as you get older, you lose muscle mass.\n\n1:05:55.740 --> 1:05:57.620\n It's a percent or so a year.\n\n1:05:57.620 --> 1:05:59.420\n And I don't wanna be frail when I'm older\n\n1:05:59.420 --> 1:06:00.820\n and fall over and break my hip,\n\n1:06:00.820 --> 1:06:04.100\n which happens every 20 seconds in this country.\n\n1:06:04.100 --> 1:06:05.460\n So maintaining that strength,\n\n1:06:05.460 --> 1:06:07.900\n but also doing the cardio for the longevity,\n\n1:06:07.900 --> 1:06:10.100\n for avoiding the heart disease.\n\n1:06:10.100 --> 1:06:13.020\n Yeah, I definitely, just like with fasting,\n\n1:06:13.020 --> 1:06:15.580\n have the philosophical benefit of running long\n\n1:06:15.580 --> 1:06:17.060\n and running slow.\n\n1:06:17.060 --> 1:06:19.300\n I enjoy it, because it kind of clears the mind\n\n1:06:19.300 --> 1:06:20.540\n and allows you to think,\n\n1:06:20.540 --> 1:06:22.980\n and actually listen to brown noise as I run.\n\n1:06:22.980 --> 1:06:26.340\n It really helps remove myself from the world\n\n1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:28.700\n and just like zoom in on particular thoughts.\n\n1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:29.980\n What are these brown noise?\n\n1:06:29.980 --> 1:06:31.860\n It's like white noise, but deeper.\n\n1:06:31.860 --> 1:06:35.060\n So like the white noise is like shh,\n\n1:06:35.060 --> 1:06:37.140\n and then brown noise is more like,\n\n1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:39.900\n shh, like ocean.\n\n1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:40.780\n That sounds great.\n\n1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:41.700\n I might try that.\n\n1:06:41.700 --> 1:06:44.900\n Yeah, yeah, it's more soothing probably.\n\n1:06:44.900 --> 1:06:45.740\n I'm not sure.\n\n1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:46.580\n There could be science to this.\n\n1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:47.580\n I need to look this up.\n\n1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:48.820\n I've been meaning to.\n\n1:06:48.820 --> 1:06:50.460\n But when I started,\n\n1:06:52.100 --> 1:06:53.780\n this is maybe like five years ago,\n\n1:06:53.780 --> 1:06:56.020\n I started listening to brown noise when I work.\n\n1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:58.340\n And the first time I listened to it,\n\n1:06:58.340 --> 1:07:00.220\n something happened to my mind\n\n1:07:00.220 --> 1:07:03.660\n where it just went like zoomed in\n\n1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:07.780\n to like, in a way that it felt like really weird.\n\n1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:11.540\n Like how precisely it was able to sort of\n\n1:07:11.540 --> 1:07:14.500\n remove the distractions of the world\n\n1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:16.460\n and really help my mind.\n\n1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:19.540\n Obviously, like the mind is trying to focus\n\n1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:21.700\n and then it just enabled that process\n\n1:07:21.700 --> 1:07:24.420\n of trying to focus on a particular problem.\n\n1:07:24.420 --> 1:07:26.220\n I don't know if this is generalizable to others.\n\n1:07:26.220 --> 1:07:27.300\n People should definitely try it\n\n1:07:27.300 --> 1:07:28.980\n if you're listening to this.\n\n1:07:28.980 --> 1:07:30.180\n Maybe it's just my own mind,\n\n1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:34.420\n but it's funny, like it made me,\n\n1:07:34.420 --> 1:07:35.780\n brown noise made me realize\n\n1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:38.620\n that there's probably hacks out there\n\n1:07:38.620 --> 1:07:40.140\n that work for me\n\n1:07:40.140 --> 1:07:41.780\n that I should be constantly looking for.\n\n1:07:41.780 --> 1:07:44.620\n It's almost like an encouraging\n\n1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:48.300\n and motivating event\n\n1:07:48.300 --> 1:07:49.900\n that maybe there's other stuff out there.\n\n1:07:49.900 --> 1:07:52.780\n Maybe there's other brown noise like things out there\n\n1:07:52.780 --> 1:07:56.020\n that truly like almost immediately make me feel better.\n\n1:07:56.020 --> 1:07:57.780\n I don't know if it's generalizable to others,\n\n1:07:57.780 --> 1:08:00.500\n but it does seem that it's the case\n\n1:08:00.500 --> 1:08:03.180\n that there's probably for many others,\n\n1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:05.820\n things like that that could be discovered.\n\n1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:07.980\n And so it's always disappointing\n\n1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:10.260\n when I find things in life\n\n1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:12.860\n that I wish I would have found earlier.\n\n1:08:12.860 --> 1:08:17.260\n I got LASIK eye surgery a few years ago\n\n1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.340\n and the first thought I had like the next day\n\n1:08:19.340 --> 1:08:21.260\n when I woke up is like,\n\n1:08:21.260 --> 1:08:24.100\n damn it, why didn't I do this way earlier?\n\n1:08:24.100 --> 1:08:27.220\n There's all this stuff of that nature\n\n1:08:27.220 --> 1:08:29.540\n that are yet to be discovered.\n\n1:08:29.540 --> 1:08:31.620\n So it pays to explore.\n\n1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:34.420\n You have a different mind, you have quite a beautiful mind.\n\n1:08:34.420 --> 1:08:37.100\n So I suspect brown noise helps you focus\n\n1:08:37.100 --> 1:08:39.060\n and cause you're probably all over the place\n\n1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:40.140\n if you don't control it.\n\n1:08:40.140 --> 1:08:40.980\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:08:40.980 --> 1:08:42.260\n It means something about it.\n\n1:08:42.260 --> 1:08:43.340\n It's a programmer thing.\n\n1:08:43.340 --> 1:08:48.340\n I don't, programming is a really difficult mental journey\n\n1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:52.820\n cause you have to keep a lot of things in mind.\n\n1:08:52.820 --> 1:08:56.460\n You have to, so you're constantly designing things\n\n1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:58.060\n then you have to be extremely precise\n\n1:08:58.060 --> 1:09:01.060\n by making those things concrete in code.\n\n1:09:01.060 --> 1:09:05.140\n You also have to look stuff up on the internet\n\n1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:08.660\n to sort of feed like information\n\n1:09:08.660 --> 1:09:10.420\n and looking up stuff on the internet,\n\n1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:12.380\n internet is full of like distracting things.\n\n1:09:12.380 --> 1:09:13.780\n So you have to be really focused\n\n1:09:13.780 --> 1:09:16.780\n in the way you look stuff up in pulling that information in.\n\n1:09:16.780 --> 1:09:20.100\n So it requires a certain discipline and a certain focus\n\n1:09:20.100 --> 1:09:23.980\n that I've been very much exploring how to do.\n\n1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:26.340\n Like I do it really well in the morning,\n\n1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:28.300\n coffee is involved, all those kinds of things.\n\n1:09:28.300 --> 1:09:32.620\n You're trying to optimize, keeping very positive inspired,\n\n1:09:32.620 --> 1:09:34.580\n no social media, all those kinds of things\n\n1:09:34.580 --> 1:09:36.140\n and trying to optimize for.\n\n1:09:36.140 --> 1:09:38.660\n And everybody has their own kind of little journey\n\n1:09:38.660 --> 1:09:40.540\n that they try to understand.\n\n1:09:40.540 --> 1:09:41.940\n You get this from like writers\n\n1:09:41.940 --> 1:09:45.820\n when you read about the habits of writers,\n\n1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:47.860\n like the habits they do in the morning,\n\n1:09:47.860 --> 1:09:49.820\n they usually write like two, three, four hours a day\n\n1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:50.980\n and that's it.\n\n1:09:50.980 --> 1:09:53.460\n It's like they optimize that ritual.\n\n1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:55.460\n And then there's always Hunter S. Thompson.\n\n1:09:55.460 --> 1:10:00.460\n So sometimes it pays off to be wild.\n\n1:10:01.340 --> 1:10:04.580\n What about sleep?\n\n1:10:04.580 --> 1:10:06.740\n How important is sleep for longevity?\n\n1:10:06.740 --> 1:10:10.740\n I would guess based on the evidence\n\n1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:12.180\n that it's really important\n\n1:10:12.180 --> 1:10:15.060\n and because we don't know for sure.\n\n1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:17.580\n But what we know from animal studies is the following.\n\n1:10:17.580 --> 1:10:20.260\n If you restrict sleep from a rat for just two weeks,\n\n1:10:20.260 --> 1:10:22.180\n it'll develop type two diabetes.\n\n1:10:22.180 --> 1:10:23.380\n It's that important.\n\n1:10:23.380 --> 1:10:25.820\n So that's the main thing.\n\n1:10:25.820 --> 1:10:28.460\n What we also know is at the molecular level\n\n1:10:28.460 --> 1:10:33.340\n that if you disrupt your sleep wake cycle,\n\n1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:35.100\n so we actually have proteins that go up and down\n\n1:10:35.100 --> 1:10:36.700\n that control our sleep wake.\n\n1:10:36.700 --> 1:10:39.220\n All of us, most of our cells do that.\n\n1:10:39.220 --> 1:10:42.460\n If you disrupt that, you'll get premature aging.\n\n1:10:42.460 --> 1:10:43.300\n And guess what?\n\n1:10:43.300 --> 1:10:44.140\n The opposite is true.\n\n1:10:44.140 --> 1:10:46.740\n That as you get older, that cycle,\n\n1:10:46.740 --> 1:10:49.460\n the amplitude becomes diminished.\n\n1:10:49.460 --> 1:10:51.300\n And this is why it's harder to get to sleep\n\n1:10:51.300 --> 1:10:52.140\n as you get older\n\n1:10:52.140 --> 1:10:54.500\n and you've got all sorts of problems.\n\n1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.940\n And I think what's going on is this positive feedback loop,\n\n1:10:56.940 --> 1:10:59.420\n which is a disaster in your old age,\n\n1:10:59.420 --> 1:11:02.060\n which is you're aging,\n\n1:11:02.060 --> 1:11:05.780\n you can't at this moment totally prevent that.\n\n1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:06.900\n And then it's disrupting your sleep\n\n1:11:06.900 --> 1:11:08.020\n and you get not enough sleep\n\n1:11:08.020 --> 1:11:10.460\n and then that's gonna accelerate your aging process.\n\n1:11:10.460 --> 1:11:13.700\n And so it's known that the people who are shift workers\n\n1:11:13.700 --> 1:11:17.540\n are most susceptible to certain age related diseases.\n\n1:11:17.540 --> 1:11:19.940\n So your bottom line, you definitely wanna work on that.\n\n1:11:19.940 --> 1:11:21.860\n It's one of the reasons I have this ring on my finger,\n\n1:11:21.860 --> 1:11:23.300\n which helps me optimize my sleep\n\n1:11:23.300 --> 1:11:25.860\n and learn what I do the day before,\n\n1:11:25.860 --> 1:11:28.380\n if it was a bad idea and I'll stop doing that,\n\n1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:29.740\n like eating a fried chicken.\n\n1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:34.860\n I see you're still carrying the burdens of that decision.\n\n1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:37.900\n But yeah, sleep is one of those things\n\n1:11:37.900 --> 1:11:41.580\n that's making me wonder about the variability\n\n1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:43.140\n between humans a little bit\n\n1:11:43.140 --> 1:11:46.100\n and how science is often focused on,\n\n1:11:47.540 --> 1:11:51.500\n like it's not often focused on high performers\n\n1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:52.620\n in a particular way.\n\n1:11:53.620 --> 1:11:55.220\n And it's looking at the aggregate\n\n1:11:55.220 --> 1:11:56.940\n versus the individual cases.\n\n1:11:57.820 --> 1:11:59.340\n For example, like for me,\n\n1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:00.940\n I don't know what the exact hours are,\n\n1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:04.260\n but like power naps are incredible.\n\n1:12:06.540 --> 1:12:11.540\n I tend to look at the metric of stress and happiness and joy\n\n1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:13.100\n and try to optimize those.\n\n1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:16.020\n So decreasing stress, increasing happiness\n\n1:12:16.020 --> 1:12:20.140\n and using sleep as just one of the tools to do that.\n\n1:12:20.140 --> 1:12:23.700\n Because like hitting the five, six, seven, eight,\n\n1:12:23.700 --> 1:12:27.180\n nine hour mark or whatever the correct mark is,\n\n1:12:27.180 --> 1:12:29.980\n I find that to be stress inducing for me\n\n1:12:29.980 --> 1:12:32.300\n versus stress relieving.\n\n1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:34.180\n Like thinking about that,\n\n1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:37.340\n I feel best if I sleep sometimes for eight hours,\n\n1:12:37.340 --> 1:12:39.580\n sometimes for four hours and then power nap.\n\n1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:42.580\n And as long as I have a stupid private,\n\n1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:44.460\n usually smile on my face,\n\n1:12:44.460 --> 1:12:46.180\n that's when I'm doing good,\n\n1:12:46.180 --> 1:12:49.460\n as opposed to getting a perfect amount of sleep\n\n1:12:49.460 --> 1:12:53.300\n according to whatever the latest blog post is.\n\n1:12:53.300 --> 1:12:55.380\n And I also pull all nighters still.\n\n1:12:56.500 --> 1:12:59.340\n I also think there's something about the body,\n\n1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:02.860\n like as long as you do it regularly,\n\n1:13:02.860 --> 1:13:04.420\n it's not as stress inducing.\n\n1:13:04.420 --> 1:13:06.820\n Like you know what it is.\n\n1:13:06.820 --> 1:13:08.980\n The reason I pull all nighters isn't for like,\n\n1:13:08.980 --> 1:13:11.580\n I'm playing Diablo three or something,\n\n1:13:11.580 --> 1:13:13.980\n is because I'm doing something I'm truly passionate about.\n\n1:13:13.980 --> 1:13:15.820\n Well, like I'm also love video games,\n\n1:13:15.820 --> 1:13:18.460\n but I'm doing something I'm truly passionate about.\n\n1:13:18.460 --> 1:13:21.420\n And it's almost like there's the Jocko Willing feeling\n\n1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:25.540\n of when I'm up at 7 a.m. and I haven't slept all night\n\n1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:27.140\n and still I'm working on it.\n\n1:13:27.140 --> 1:13:29.500\n There's a kind of a celebration of the human spirit\n\n1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:31.020\n that I really enjoy it.\n\n1:13:31.020 --> 1:13:33.700\n Like, and that's happiness.\n\n1:13:33.700 --> 1:13:35.940\n And to sort of then,\n\n1:13:35.940 --> 1:13:37.940\n and I usually don't tell that kind of stuff to people\n\n1:13:37.940 --> 1:13:40.820\n because their first statement will be like,\n\n1:13:40.820 --> 1:13:42.580\n you should get more sleep.\n\n1:13:42.580 --> 1:13:46.180\n It's like, no, I'm doing stuff I love.\n\n1:13:46.180 --> 1:13:48.980\n You should get more love in your life, bro.\n\n1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:50.380\n That's right.\n\n1:13:50.380 --> 1:13:52.500\n So, but that said, in aggregate,\n\n1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:55.340\n when you look at the full span of life,\n\n1:13:55.340 --> 1:13:57.980\n is probably you should be getting\n\n1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:00.700\n a consistent amount of sleep.\n\n1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:04.900\n And it seems like it's in that seven, eight hour range.\n\n1:14:04.900 --> 1:14:06.700\n Yeah, but it's similar to food.\n\n1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:09.300\n It's the quality, not the quantity, right?\n\n1:14:09.300 --> 1:14:10.700\n And when you get it.\n\n1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:14.420\n So I look at my data pretty often.\n\n1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:17.140\n And what makes a difference to me is not the amount of hours,\n\n1:14:17.140 --> 1:14:20.380\n but the quality, the depth and the deep sleep\n\n1:14:20.380 --> 1:14:21.900\n is what will do it.\n\n1:14:21.900 --> 1:14:24.820\n So if I have a lot of alcohol before going to sleep\n\n1:14:24.820 --> 1:14:26.340\n and I can see my heart rate being different,\n\n1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:28.380\n but what really kills me is that I don't get a lot\n\n1:14:28.380 --> 1:14:32.420\n of that deep sleep and I wake up barely remembering stuff.\n\n1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:34.380\n So that, like you say, if you're happy and contented\n\n1:14:34.380 --> 1:14:37.100\n and you don't have these cortisol chemicals\n\n1:14:37.100 --> 1:14:38.340\n going through your body,\n\n1:14:38.340 --> 1:14:40.660\n you will more naturally get into that deep state.\n\n1:14:40.660 --> 1:14:42.260\n And even if you just get four hours,\n\n1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:45.380\n way better than eight hours of none of that.\n\n1:14:45.380 --> 1:14:46.860\n Yeah, yeah, that's beautiful.\n\n1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:48.180\n And some of that could be genetic.\n\n1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:51.980\n For me, I just, I fall asleep like this.\n\n1:14:51.980 --> 1:14:54.140\n If you want me to fall asleep right now, I can do it.\n\n1:14:54.140 --> 1:14:57.300\n It's no, I have no problem with it.\n\n1:14:57.300 --> 1:14:59.300\n Combined with coffee, I just had two energy drinks.\n\n1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:01.420\n I can probably sleep.\n\n1:15:01.420 --> 1:15:03.540\n So that, I don't know if that's genetics\n\n1:15:03.540 --> 1:15:07.500\n or it's kind of, I don't know what it is.\n\n1:15:07.500 --> 1:15:09.700\n Or maybe that I don't have kids and I'm single.\n\n1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:11.900\n So I don't have, I'm almost listening\n\n1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:15.340\n to some kind of biological signal versus societal signal\n\n1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:17.060\n on when I'm supposed to go to sleep.\n\n1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:20.660\n So I just go to sleep whenever I feel like going to sleep.\n\n1:15:20.660 --> 1:15:22.460\n Well, that's because you're a self employed.\n\n1:15:22.460 --> 1:15:23.300\n Self employed.\n\n1:15:23.300 --> 1:15:24.620\n Most people don't have that luxury,\n\n1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:26.100\n but we're lucky, the two of us,\n\n1:15:26.100 --> 1:15:27.580\n that we can make our own hours.\n\n1:15:27.580 --> 1:15:28.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:28.420 --> 1:15:29.780\n But yeah, it's super important.\n\n1:15:29.780 --> 1:15:32.340\n And those people who have shift work,\n\n1:15:32.340 --> 1:15:35.460\n I mean, they really need to change the way that works\n\n1:15:35.460 --> 1:15:37.780\n because they're literally killing those people.\n\n1:15:38.900 --> 1:15:41.740\n Is there something you could say about the,\n\n1:15:41.740 --> 1:15:46.740\n the mind and stress in terms of effect on longevity?\n\n1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:52.460\n Sort of, I don't know if you think about it this way,\n\n1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:55.060\n but when you talk about the biological machine,\n\n1:15:55.060 --> 1:15:57.780\n it's always these mechanisms that don't,\n\n1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:00.860\n are not necessarily directly connected to the brain\n\n1:16:00.860 --> 1:16:02.620\n or the operation of the brain.\n\n1:16:02.620 --> 1:16:06.300\n Like what's the role about stress and happiness\n\n1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:10.700\n and yeah, the sort of higher cognitive things\n\n1:16:10.700 --> 1:16:13.020\n going on in the brain on longevity.\n\n1:16:14.220 --> 1:16:15.060\n Right.\n\n1:16:15.060 --> 1:16:16.820\n Well, that's a great point that the brain\n\n1:16:16.820 --> 1:16:18.300\n is the center for longevity.\n\n1:16:18.300 --> 1:16:20.260\n Actually, we do know that.\n\n1:16:21.140 --> 1:16:22.780\n For a start, when I'm stressed,\n\n1:16:22.780 --> 1:16:24.620\n I can see mentally stressed,\n\n1:16:24.620 --> 1:16:27.060\n then I can see it in my body.\n\n1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:29.540\n Heart rate, hormones, it's clear.\n\n1:16:29.540 --> 1:16:31.420\n That's no true surprise.\n\n1:16:31.420 --> 1:16:33.940\n So you've got to work on your brain first and foremost.\n\n1:16:33.940 --> 1:16:38.940\n If you are totally freaked out, agitated all the time,\n\n1:16:38.940 --> 1:16:40.300\n you will live shorter.\n\n1:16:40.300 --> 1:16:41.140\n I'm certain of it.\n\n1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:42.540\n You know, I keep fish.\n\n1:16:42.540 --> 1:16:46.460\n I'm a big aquarium guy.\n\n1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:47.300\n And you can see the difference\n\n1:16:47.300 --> 1:16:50.540\n between the fish that's having a good time and dominant\n\n1:16:50.540 --> 1:16:52.180\n and one that gets picked on.\n\n1:16:52.180 --> 1:16:54.300\n It just looks like crap.\n\n1:16:54.300 --> 1:16:55.140\n You don't want to be that,\n\n1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:57.740\n the little fish getting picked on if you can help it.\n\n1:16:57.740 --> 1:17:00.100\n So I used to be extremely stressed as a kid.\n\n1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:02.540\n I was a perfectionist, very shy,\n\n1:17:02.540 --> 1:17:05.380\n always worried about being a failure.\n\n1:17:05.380 --> 1:17:06.660\n If I didn't get an A+, you know,\n\n1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:10.500\n I was crying in my bedroom, that kind of sad existence.\n\n1:17:10.500 --> 1:17:12.860\n I got into my twenties, then in my thirties,\n\n1:17:12.860 --> 1:17:15.260\n and realized that's not the way to live.\n\n1:17:15.260 --> 1:17:17.460\n So I've worked very hard to get to this point\n\n1:17:17.460 --> 1:17:20.700\n where I almost never get stressed, never.\n\n1:17:20.700 --> 1:17:23.100\n There's nothing that, I've never gotten angry in my lab.\n\n1:17:23.100 --> 1:17:24.100\n I've got 20 kids.\n\n1:17:24.100 --> 1:17:25.580\n Sometimes it's like a,\n\n1:17:25.580 --> 1:17:28.300\n most of the time it's like a kindergarten.\n\n1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:29.980\n I haven't lost my temper.\n\n1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:32.380\n I'm very calm, but that's intentional.\n\n1:17:32.380 --> 1:17:34.420\n And I don't worry about stuff.\n\n1:17:34.420 --> 1:17:37.900\n Millions of dollars, billions of dollars at stake sometimes.\n\n1:17:39.060 --> 1:17:39.900\n Keep it cool.\n\n1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:40.740\n It's only life.\n\n1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:42.740\n We're all headed to the same place anyway.\n\n1:17:42.740 --> 1:17:44.260\n Don't worry about it.\n\n1:17:44.260 --> 1:17:47.740\n But to answer your question, I think in a better way,\n\n1:17:47.740 --> 1:17:49.740\n if you manipulate the brain of an animal,\n\n1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:51.500\n I'll give you an example.\n\n1:17:51.500 --> 1:17:53.780\n If we turn on this CERT gene that I mentioned,\n\n1:17:53.780 --> 1:17:56.660\n CERT1, we, a good friend of mine at WashU,\n\n1:17:56.660 --> 1:17:58.060\n Sheena Mai did this.\n\n1:17:58.060 --> 1:18:00.420\n They upregulated that gene\n\n1:18:00.420 --> 1:18:03.180\n just in the neurons of the animal.\n\n1:18:03.180 --> 1:18:04.740\n It lived longer.\n\n1:18:04.740 --> 1:18:06.900\n So that's sufficient to extend lifespan.\n\n1:18:06.900 --> 1:18:09.980\n We also know that you can manipulate the part of the brain\n\n1:18:09.980 --> 1:18:10.980\n called the hypothalamus,\n\n1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:15.060\n which leeches a lot of chemicals into the body and proteins,\n\n1:18:15.060 --> 1:18:17.060\n most of which we don't know yet,\n\n1:18:17.060 --> 1:18:19.700\n but just changing the inflammation of that little organ\n\n1:18:20.980 --> 1:18:22.860\n or part of the brain is sufficient\n\n1:18:22.860 --> 1:18:24.900\n to make animals live longer as well.\n\n1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:26.460\n So get your brain in order first\n\n1:18:26.460 --> 1:18:29.420\n before you tackle anything else, I would say.\n\n1:18:29.420 --> 1:18:31.660\n So you kind of mentioned this,\n\n1:18:31.660 --> 1:18:34.420\n with the inside tracker, there's ability\n\n1:18:34.420 --> 1:18:38.340\n to take blood measurement and then infer from that\n\n1:18:39.420 --> 1:18:40.980\n a bunch of different things about your body\n\n1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:44.700\n and how you can improve the longevity.\n\n1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:47.060\n And you've also mentioned saliva\n\n1:18:47.060 --> 1:18:52.060\n and more efficient ways to get data.\n\n1:18:54.020 --> 1:18:55.420\n What does that involve?\n\n1:18:55.420 --> 1:18:57.380\n What's the future of data collection look like\n\n1:18:57.380 --> 1:18:59.220\n for the human biological system?\n\n1:18:59.220 --> 1:19:01.740\n Right, well, yeah, the issue with blood is\n\n1:19:01.740 --> 1:19:03.380\n you need someone to take it.\n\n1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:06.060\n I mean, or you prick your finger, which hurts.\n\n1:19:06.060 --> 1:19:07.100\n So you've got to have something better.\n\n1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:08.980\n So I think what the future looks like\n\n1:19:08.980 --> 1:19:12.380\n is that you'll spit onto a little piece of paper\n\n1:19:12.380 --> 1:19:14.740\n and stick it in a machine and it'll do that for you.\n\n1:19:14.740 --> 1:19:15.620\n But we're not there yet.\n\n1:19:15.620 --> 1:19:20.620\n So the intermediate future that I'm building right now\n\n1:19:20.980 --> 1:19:24.180\n is that you would take a swab of the inside of your mouth,\n\n1:19:24.180 --> 1:19:26.740\n which is the easiest way to take cells out of your body\n\n1:19:26.740 --> 1:19:28.340\n and just ship them off.\n\n1:19:28.340 --> 1:19:30.780\n Okay, so it's called a buckle swab.\n\n1:19:30.780 --> 1:19:32.900\n I think we became very used to that.\n\n1:19:32.900 --> 1:19:34.340\n Right now, because of COVID,\n\n1:19:34.340 --> 1:19:36.100\n people don't like going to the doctor as much.\n\n1:19:36.100 --> 1:19:36.940\n They don't like going out.\n\n1:19:36.940 --> 1:19:38.700\n They just want to have home tests.\n\n1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:40.780\n And so that I think is the next 10 years\n\n1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:43.140\n where you'll get a kit in the mail,\n\n1:19:43.140 --> 1:19:45.300\n you'll swab your cheeks, stick it back in an envelope,\n\n1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:48.700\n send it off and a week later you have\n\n1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:52.900\n either a doctor's report or a health recommendation.\n\n1:19:52.900 --> 1:19:54.980\n And what can you get off a cheek swab?\n\n1:19:54.980 --> 1:19:55.860\n Well, you can get anything.\n\n1:19:55.860 --> 1:19:58.380\n You can get hormones, stress levels,\n\n1:19:58.380 --> 1:20:00.900\n stress hormones, blood glucose levels.\n\n1:20:00.900 --> 1:20:04.380\n You can also tell your age reasonably accurately doing that,\n\n1:20:04.380 --> 1:20:05.900\n actually quite accurately.\n\n1:20:05.900 --> 1:20:08.260\n And those clocks can not just tell you\n\n1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:10.220\n how you're doing over time,\n\n1:20:10.220 --> 1:20:12.220\n but can be used to give you recommendations\n\n1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:14.220\n to slow that process down.\n\n1:20:14.220 --> 1:20:16.620\n Cause some people sometimes are 10 years older biologically\n\n1:20:16.620 --> 1:20:19.580\n than their actual chronological age.\n\n1:20:19.580 --> 1:20:21.940\n I mean, why does it matter how many times\n\n1:20:21.940 --> 1:20:23.740\n the earth's gone around the sun seriously?\n\n1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:24.940\n Who cares about birthdays?\n\n1:20:24.940 --> 1:20:27.260\n It's how long your body's clock has been ticking\n\n1:20:27.260 --> 1:20:28.580\n and how fast.\n\n1:20:28.580 --> 1:20:31.060\n So I could take a cheek swab from you today, Lex,\n\n1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:32.740\n take it back to my lab.\n\n1:20:32.740 --> 1:20:35.420\n And we then by tomorrow tell you\n\n1:20:35.420 --> 1:20:37.740\n how old you are biologically based on\n\n1:20:37.740 --> 1:20:40.940\n what we call the epigenetic clock.\n\n1:20:40.940 --> 1:20:43.140\n And you might be freaked out, you might be happy,\n\n1:20:43.140 --> 1:20:45.580\n but either way we can advise you\n\n1:20:45.580 --> 1:20:47.860\n on how to improve the trajectory.\n\n1:20:47.860 --> 1:20:49.420\n Cause we know that smoking increases\n\n1:20:49.420 --> 1:20:50.900\n the speed of that clock.\n\n1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:54.220\n We also know that fasting and people who eat the right foods\n\n1:20:54.220 --> 1:20:55.980\n have a slower clock.\n\n1:20:55.980 --> 1:20:58.340\n Without that knowledge, you're flying blind.\n\n1:20:58.340 --> 1:20:59.820\n But I like the idea of a swab,\n\n1:20:59.820 --> 1:21:01.260\n cause it's just so easy.\n\n1:21:01.260 --> 1:21:03.260\n A lot of us have done something like that for COVID tests.\n\n1:21:03.260 --> 1:21:04.100\n It's not a big deal.\n\n1:21:04.100 --> 1:21:06.180\n I've been doing a nonstop rapid antigen test.\n\n1:21:06.180 --> 1:21:11.060\n So let me say that particular one rapid antigen test,\n\n1:21:11.060 --> 1:21:12.700\n they've been a source of frustration for me\n\n1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:14.860\n because like everybody should be doing it.\n\n1:21:14.860 --> 1:21:16.100\n It's so easy.\n\n1:21:16.100 --> 1:21:18.420\n We've also been working in my lab on democratizing\n\n1:21:18.420 --> 1:21:20.740\n these tests to bring them down from a few hundred bucks\n\n1:21:20.740 --> 1:21:22.060\n to a dollar.\n\n1:21:22.060 --> 1:21:22.980\n So just to clarify,\n\n1:21:22.980 --> 1:21:24.260\n you're talking about not research,\n\n1:21:24.260 --> 1:21:25.820\n you're talking about like company stuff,\n\n1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:28.620\n like actual consumer facing things?\n\n1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:29.460\n Well, right.\n\n1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:30.980\n The research on bringing the price down\n\n1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:32.940\n has occurred in my lab at Harvard.\n\n1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:35.100\n And then that intellectual property is being licensed\n\n1:21:35.100 --> 1:21:37.060\n and has been licensed out to a company\n\n1:21:37.060 --> 1:21:40.300\n that will be consumer facing.\n\n1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:43.340\n So anybody for a small amount of money can do this.\n\n1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:46.420\n Well, you got subscriber number one obsessed.\n\n1:21:46.420 --> 1:21:48.660\n I think that's a beautiful, beautiful idea.\n\n1:21:48.660 --> 1:21:51.460\n So somebody who maybe I would have been more hesitant\n\n1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:53.580\n about it until COVID,\n\n1:21:54.500 --> 1:21:56.300\n but the home tests are super easy.\n\n1:21:56.300 --> 1:21:59.340\n I almost wanted to share that data with the world,\n\n1:21:59.340 --> 1:22:01.820\n like in some way, not the entirety of the data,\n\n1:22:01.820 --> 1:22:05.740\n but like some visualization of like how I'm doing.\n\n1:22:05.740 --> 1:22:09.380\n Like, it's almost like when you share,\n\n1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:11.420\n if you had like a long run or something like that,\n\n1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:14.540\n I wish I could share because it inspires others.\n\n1:22:14.540 --> 1:22:16.900\n And then you can have a conversation about like,\n\n1:22:16.900 --> 1:22:18.780\n well, what are the hacks that you've tried\n\n1:22:18.780 --> 1:22:21.380\n and have a conversation about like how to improve lifestyle\n\n1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:23.660\n and those kinds of things that's grounded in data.\n\n1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:25.580\n That's exactly, that's what's gonna happen.\n\n1:22:25.580 --> 1:22:27.700\n Now, everything's anonymous, of course.\n\n1:22:27.700 --> 1:22:29.620\n We talked about security there,\n\n1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:32.540\n but once it's anonymized, you can then plot these numbers.\n\n1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:35.580\n And I've plotted my epigenetic age\n\n1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:37.300\n versus hundreds of other people\n\n1:22:37.300 --> 1:22:39.060\n who have taken this test now.\n\n1:22:39.060 --> 1:22:41.460\n And I can tell you where I fit relative to others\n\n1:22:41.460 --> 1:22:43.580\n in terms of my biological age.\n\n1:22:43.580 --> 1:22:44.980\n And I'm happy to share that with you\n\n1:22:44.980 --> 1:22:46.340\n because it's pretty low.\n\n1:22:47.260 --> 1:22:48.500\n You can choose to share it, of course,\n\n1:22:48.500 --> 1:22:50.460\n not everyone wants to share that.\n\n1:22:50.460 --> 1:22:52.220\n But when you go to the doctor,\n\n1:22:52.220 --> 1:22:54.860\n first of all, your doctor does treat you\n\n1:22:54.860 --> 1:22:55.940\n as though you're an average person\n\n1:22:55.940 --> 1:22:58.620\n and none of us are average, there's no such thing.\n\n1:22:58.620 --> 1:23:00.300\n But second of all, we never know\n\n1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:01.740\n how we're doing relative to others\n\n1:23:01.740 --> 1:23:05.820\n because we all, most of us, we don't share our information.\n\n1:23:05.820 --> 1:23:08.060\n So we might have this number and that number,\n\n1:23:08.060 --> 1:23:10.220\n but do you know that your numbers are good for your age\n\n1:23:10.220 --> 1:23:11.300\n or not?\n\n1:23:11.300 --> 1:23:12.740\n You have no idea.\n\n1:23:12.740 --> 1:23:14.540\n Even your doctor probably doesn't even know.\n\n1:23:14.540 --> 1:23:16.340\n So this graph that I'm talking about\n\n1:23:16.340 --> 1:23:18.020\n is the beginning of a world where you can say,\n\n1:23:18.020 --> 1:23:18.940\n how am I doing?\n\n1:23:18.940 --> 1:23:22.700\n For the two of us, we're white and we're male\n\n1:23:22.700 --> 1:23:25.380\n and we're this age and we do this.\n\n1:23:26.380 --> 1:23:27.220\n Are we good?\n\n1:23:27.220 --> 1:23:28.580\n Are we doing the right things or the wrong things?\n\n1:23:28.580 --> 1:23:30.420\n Do we need to fix certain things?\n\n1:23:30.420 --> 1:23:32.100\n And this is what the future is.\n\n1:23:32.100 --> 1:23:35.340\n It's forget about just experimenting\n\n1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:36.260\n and not knowing the result.\n\n1:23:36.260 --> 1:23:38.500\n I mean, who doesn't experiment and doesn't look at the data?\n\n1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:40.180\n No one, it makes no sense.\n\n1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:41.180\n So we're gonna enter a world\n\n1:23:41.180 --> 1:23:43.460\n where we have a dashboard on our body,\n\n1:23:43.460 --> 1:23:46.420\n the swabs, the blood tests, the biosensors\n\n1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:48.500\n where our doctors can look at that,\n\n1:23:48.500 --> 1:23:51.580\n but we can also look at it and they can recommend,\n\n1:23:51.580 --> 1:23:52.980\n go to this restaurant down the road.\n\n1:23:52.980 --> 1:23:54.380\n They've got this great meal.\n\n1:23:54.380 --> 1:23:56.300\n It's high in whatever you need today\n\n1:23:56.300 --> 1:23:58.460\n because you're lacking vitamin D and vitamin K2.\n\n1:23:58.460 --> 1:23:59.300\n Go for it.\n\n1:24:00.380 --> 1:24:03.260\n Ridiculous question or perhaps not.\n\n1:24:03.260 --> 1:24:05.100\n If you look maybe 50 years from now\n\n1:24:05.100 --> 1:24:07.740\n or 100 years from now, a person born then,\n\n1:24:07.740 --> 1:24:09.260\n what do you think is a good goal\n\n1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:12.340\n in terms of how long a person would live?\n\n1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:16.020\n What is the maximum longevity that we can achieve\n\n1:24:16.020 --> 1:24:18.460\n through the methods that we have today\n\n1:24:19.860 --> 1:24:21.140\n or are developing some of the things\n\n1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:25.100\n we've been talking about in terms of genetics,\n\n1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:26.260\n in terms of biology?\n\n1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:28.140\n Is there a number?\n\n1:24:29.660 --> 1:24:31.740\n Right, well, so it changes all the time\n\n1:24:31.740 --> 1:24:33.420\n because technology is changing so quickly.\n\n1:24:33.420 --> 1:24:36.260\n I keep revising the number upward,\n\n1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:38.660\n but I would say that if you do the right things\n\n1:24:38.660 --> 1:24:40.780\n during your life and start at an early age,\n\n1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:43.260\n let's say 25, we don't want malnutrition, starvation.\n\n1:24:43.260 --> 1:24:45.160\n That's not what I'm talking about.\n\n1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:48.860\n But in your 20s, start eating the kind of diets\n\n1:24:48.860 --> 1:24:51.880\n that I talked about, skipping meals.\n\n1:24:51.880 --> 1:24:55.940\n In animals, that gives you an extra 20 to 30%.\n\n1:24:55.940 --> 1:24:57.820\n We don't know if that's true for humans\n\n1:24:57.820 --> 1:25:02.080\n and even 5% more would be a big deal for the planet.\n\n1:25:03.220 --> 1:25:06.640\n I think that we should all aim to at least reach a century.\n\n1:25:08.540 --> 1:25:09.380\n I'm a little bit behind.\n\n1:25:09.380 --> 1:25:12.040\n I was born too early to benefit the most\n\n1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:13.820\n from all of this discovery.\n\n1:25:13.820 --> 1:25:16.000\n Those of you who are in your 20s,\n\n1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.700\n you should definitely aim to reach a hundred.\n\n1:25:18.700 --> 1:25:19.660\n I don't see why not.\n\n1:25:20.860 --> 1:25:23.140\n Consider this, this is really important.\n\n1:25:23.140 --> 1:25:25.040\n The average lifespan of a human\n\n1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:28.120\n that looks after themselves but doesn't pay attention\n\n1:25:29.500 --> 1:25:31.000\n is about 80, okay?\n\n1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:34.160\n Japan, that's the average age for a male, a bit higher.\n\n1:25:35.220 --> 1:25:37.220\n If you do the right things in your life,\n\n1:25:37.220 --> 1:25:41.100\n which is eat healthy food, don't overeat,\n\n1:25:41.100 --> 1:25:42.900\n don't become obese, do a bit of exercise,\n\n1:25:42.900 --> 1:25:44.720\n get good sleep and don't stress,\n\n1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:47.220\n that gives you on average 14 extra years.\n\n1:25:47.220 --> 1:25:49.060\n That gets you to 94.\n\n1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:50.260\n So getting to a hundred,\n\n1:25:50.260 --> 1:25:52.540\n if you just focus on what I'm talking about,\n\n1:25:52.540 --> 1:25:53.700\n it's not a big deal.\n\n1:25:53.700 --> 1:25:54.620\n So what's the maximum?\n\n1:25:54.620 --> 1:25:57.380\n Well, we know that one human made it to 122\n\n1:25:57.380 --> 1:26:00.360\n and a number of them make it into their teens.\n\n1:26:00.360 --> 1:26:02.140\n I think that's also the next level\n\n1:26:02.140 --> 1:26:06.300\n of where we can get to with the types of technologies\n\n1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:07.580\n that I'm talking about.\n\n1:26:07.580 --> 1:26:09.980\n Medicines, like I mentioned rapamycin,\n\n1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:12.840\n there's one called metformin, which is the diabetes drug,\n\n1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:14.420\n which I take.\n\n1:26:14.420 --> 1:26:16.460\n That in combination with these lifestyle changes\n\n1:26:16.460 --> 1:26:18.380\n should get us beyond a hundred.\n\n1:26:18.380 --> 1:26:19.640\n How long can we ultimately live?\n\n1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:22.260\n Well, there's no maximum limit to human lifespan.\n\n1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:24.600\n Why can a whale live 300 years, but we cannot?\n\n1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:26.240\n We're basically the same structure.\n\n1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:27.980\n We just need to learn from them.\n\n1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:31.060\n So anyone who says, oh, you max out at X,\n\n1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:33.300\n I think is full of it.\n\n1:26:33.300 --> 1:26:35.360\n There's nothing that I've seen that says\n\n1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:37.520\n biological organisms have to die.\n\n1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:39.500\n There are trees that live for thousands of years\n\n1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:42.480\n and their biochemistry is pretty close to ours.\n\n1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:44.960\n What do you think it means to live for a very long time?\n\n1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:47.300\n Let's say if it's 200 years we're talking about\n\n1:26:47.300 --> 1:26:48.660\n or a thousand years.\n\n1:26:50.940 --> 1:26:54.580\n There's some sense, you could argue,\n\n1:26:54.580 --> 1:26:58.020\n that there is immortal organisms already living on Earth,\n\n1:26:58.020 --> 1:26:59.020\n like there's bacteria.\n\n1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:03.740\n So there's certain living organisms\n\n1:27:03.740 --> 1:27:07.940\n that in some fundamental way do not die\n\n1:27:07.940 --> 1:27:10.260\n because they keep replicating their genetic,\n\n1:27:10.260 --> 1:27:12.660\n they keep like cloning themselves.\n\n1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:17.660\n Is it the same human if we can somehow persist\n\n1:27:19.100 --> 1:27:23.940\n the human mind, like copy, clone certain aspects\n\n1:27:23.940 --> 1:27:26.400\n and just keep replacing body parts?\n\n1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:30.460\n Do you think that's another way to achieve immortality?\n\n1:27:30.460 --> 1:27:33.780\n To achieve a prolonged sort of increased longevity\n\n1:27:33.780 --> 1:27:37.140\n is to replace the parts that break easily\n\n1:27:37.140 --> 1:27:42.140\n and keep, because actually from your theory of aging\n\n1:27:42.220 --> 1:27:44.460\n as a degradation of information,\n\n1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:46.540\n so an information theory view of aging,\n\n1:27:48.260 --> 1:27:51.480\n like what is the key information that makes a human?\n\n1:27:51.480 --> 1:27:53.420\n Can we persist that information\n\n1:27:53.420 --> 1:27:56.200\n and just replace the trivial parts?\n\n1:27:57.300 --> 1:27:59.340\n Yeah, I mean the short answer is yes.\n\n1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:01.340\n We're already replacing body parts\n\n1:28:01.340 --> 1:28:03.820\n but what makes us human is our brain.\n\n1:28:03.820 --> 1:28:07.380\n Everything else is suboptimal except our brain.\n\n1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:13.660\n The ability to replace actual neurons is really hard.\n\n1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:16.220\n I think it might be easy to upload\n\n1:28:16.220 --> 1:28:19.180\n rather than replace neurons because they're so tight,\n\n1:28:19.180 --> 1:28:22.280\n it's such a network and just perturbing the system.\n\n1:28:24.380 --> 1:28:25.720\n It's Roger and Gizcat.\n\n1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:28.760\n You change everything once you get in there.\n\n1:28:28.760 --> 1:28:31.800\n The problem is, well, I guess the solution,\n\n1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:34.180\n let me go to the solution that's more interesting.\n\n1:28:34.180 --> 1:28:35.980\n What we're learning is that if you reverse\n\n1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:37.380\n the age of nerve cells,\n\n1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:41.420\n it looks like they get their memories back.\n\n1:28:41.420 --> 1:28:42.660\n So the memories are not lost.\n\n1:28:42.660 --> 1:28:45.300\n They're just that the cells don't know how to interpret them\n\n1:28:45.300 --> 1:28:46.860\n and function correctly.\n\n1:28:46.860 --> 1:28:48.860\n And this is one of the things we're studying in my lab.\n\n1:28:48.860 --> 1:28:50.420\n If you take an old mouse that has learned something\n\n1:28:50.420 --> 1:28:53.660\n when it was young but forgotten, does it get that back?\n\n1:28:53.660 --> 1:28:56.460\n And all evidence points to that being true.\n\n1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:59.620\n So I'd rather go in and rejuvenate the brain as it sits\n\n1:28:59.620 --> 1:29:01.280\n rather than replace individual cells,\n\n1:29:01.280 --> 1:29:03.120\n which would be really hard.\n\n1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:06.700\n What do you think about like efforts like Neuralink,\n\n1:29:06.700 --> 1:29:10.260\n which basically you mentioned uploading,\n\n1:29:10.260 --> 1:29:11.700\n are trying to figure out,\n\n1:29:11.700 --> 1:29:13.660\n so creating brain computer interfaces\n\n1:29:13.660 --> 1:29:14.620\n that are trying to figure out\n\n1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:16.880\n how to communicate with the brain.\n\n1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:19.380\n But one of the features of that is trying to record\n\n1:29:19.380 --> 1:29:22.740\n the human brain more and more accurately.\n\n1:29:22.740 --> 1:29:26.080\n Do you have hope for that to,\n\n1:29:27.220 --> 1:29:30.780\n of course, it will lead to us better understanding\n\n1:29:30.780 --> 1:29:33.260\n from a neuroscience perspective, the human mind,\n\n1:29:33.260 --> 1:29:36.060\n but do you have hope for it increasing longevity\n\n1:29:36.060 --> 1:29:38.340\n in terms of how it's used?\n\n1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.180\n I think that it can help with certain diseases.\n\n1:29:41.180 --> 1:29:42.980\n But I see, at least within our lifetime,\n\n1:29:42.980 --> 1:29:45.300\n that's the best use of it is to be able to replace\n\n1:29:45.300 --> 1:29:47.620\n parts of the body that are not functioning,\n\n1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:50.140\n such as the retina and other parts,\n\n1:29:50.140 --> 1:29:51.840\n the visual cortex back here.\n\n1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:53.900\n That's going to be doable.\n\n1:29:53.900 --> 1:29:55.300\n In terms of longevity,\n\n1:29:55.300 --> 1:29:58.040\n maybe we could put something on the hypothalamus\n\n1:29:58.040 --> 1:30:00.780\n and start secreting those hormones and get that back.\n\n1:30:02.300 --> 1:30:06.780\n Ultimately, I think the best way to preserve the brain\n\n1:30:06.780 --> 1:30:10.780\n is going to be to record it.\n\n1:30:10.780 --> 1:30:12.700\n But also, I think it's going to require death,\n\n1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:16.980\n unfortunately, to then do very detailed scans,\n\n1:30:16.980 --> 1:30:20.580\n even if you have enough time and money, atomic microscopy,\n\n1:30:20.580 --> 1:30:22.540\n and rebuild the brain from scratch.\n\n1:30:22.540 --> 1:30:24.500\n Rebuild from scratch, yeah.\n\n1:30:24.500 --> 1:30:28.860\n We are living more and more in a digital world.\n\n1:30:28.860 --> 1:30:31.500\n I wonder if the scanning is good enough\n\n1:30:31.500 --> 1:30:34.420\n for the critical things in terms of memories,\n\n1:30:34.420 --> 1:30:36.420\n in terms of the particular quirks\n\n1:30:36.420 --> 1:30:38.120\n of your cognitive processes.\n\n1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:40.420\n They're not, they're not, yeah.\n\n1:30:40.420 --> 1:30:42.040\n We're not close, yes,\n\n1:30:42.040 --> 1:30:44.580\n but we've made quite a bit of progress,\n\n1:30:44.580 --> 1:30:49.580\n so if you're an exponential type of person.\n\n1:30:50.220 --> 1:30:52.140\n Yeah, well, let's dream a little here.\n\n1:30:52.140 --> 1:30:52.980\n Yes, that's the point.\n\n1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:56.220\n The way it would work, that I could see it working is,\n\n1:30:56.220 --> 1:31:00.880\n so you take a single cell slice through your dead brain,\n\n1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:01.860\n and we can now,\n\n1:31:01.860 --> 1:31:04.820\n the problem with the engineering aspect is that,\n\n1:31:04.820 --> 1:31:07.420\n the engineering is, the physical aspect of the brain\n\n1:31:07.420 --> 1:31:09.700\n is not even half the problem.\n\n1:31:09.700 --> 1:31:12.980\n The problem is which genes are switched on and off.\n\n1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:15.140\n This experience that we're having here\n\n1:31:15.140 --> 1:31:18.260\n is altering certain genes in neurons\n\n1:31:18.260 --> 1:31:22.060\n that will be preserved, hopefully, for a number of decades,\n\n1:31:22.060 --> 1:31:25.300\n but you cannot see that with a microscope easily,\n\n1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:27.780\n but there are technologies invented,\n\n1:31:27.780 --> 1:31:30.740\n actually just down the hall in the building I'm at,\n\n1:31:30.740 --> 1:31:33.520\n George Church invented a way, his lab invented a way,\n\n1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:35.980\n to look at which genes are switched on and off,\n\n1:31:36.840 --> 1:31:40.100\n not only in a single cell, which any lab can do these days,\n\n1:31:40.100 --> 1:31:42.980\n but in situ, where it's situated in the brain.\n\n1:31:42.980 --> 1:31:45.240\n So you can say, okay, this nerve cell,\n\n1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.700\n had these genes switched on and these switched off,\n\n1:31:47.700 --> 1:31:49.740\n we can recreate that,\n\n1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:50.980\n but just scanning the brain\n\n1:31:50.980 --> 1:31:52.540\n and looking how the nerves are touching each other\n\n1:31:52.540 --> 1:31:53.540\n is not gonna do it.\n\n1:31:54.820 --> 1:31:55.900\n Wow, okay.\n\n1:31:55.900 --> 1:31:59.260\n So you have to scan the full biology, the full details.\n\n1:31:59.260 --> 1:32:00.420\n And look at the epigenome.\n\n1:32:00.420 --> 1:32:01.580\n And the epigenome too.\n\n1:32:01.580 --> 1:32:03.140\n Yeah, which genes are on and off.\n\n1:32:03.140 --> 1:32:05.080\n It's just easier to reset the epigenome\n\n1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:06.500\n and get them to work like they used to.\n\n1:32:06.500 --> 1:32:07.540\n True, true.\n\n1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:08.380\n We're doing that now.\n\n1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:09.760\n Use the hardware we already have,\n\n1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:13.860\n just figure out how to make that hardware last longer.\n\n1:32:13.860 --> 1:32:15.700\n Right, ultimately information will be lost,\n\n1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:19.380\n even genetic information degrades slowly through mutation.\n\n1:32:19.380 --> 1:32:22.540\n So immortality is not achievable through that means,\n\n1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:25.280\n though I think we could potentially reset the body\n\n1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:28.480\n hundreds of times and live for thousands of years.\n\n1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:31.540\n Okay, so we talked about biology.\n\n1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:34.620\n Let's, forgive me, but let's talk about philosophy\n\n1:32:34.620 --> 1:32:36.740\n for just a brief moment.\n\n1:32:36.740 --> 1:32:38.740\n So somebody I've enjoyed reading,\n\n1:32:38.740 --> 1:32:40.700\n Ernest Becker wrote The Denial of Death.\n\n1:32:40.700 --> 1:32:42.980\n There's also Martin Heidegger.\n\n1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:47.820\n There's a bunch of philosophers who claim\n\n1:32:47.820 --> 1:32:51.980\n that most people live life in denial of death.\n\n1:32:51.980 --> 1:32:56.980\n Sort of we don't fully internalize\n\n1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:00.140\n the idea that we're going to die.\n\n1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:07.000\n Because if we did, as they say,\n\n1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:10.260\n there will be a kind of terror of,\n\n1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:14.120\n I mean a deep fear of death.\n\n1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.280\n The fact that we don't know what's,\n\n1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:22.280\n like we almost don't know what to do with non existence,\n\n1:33:23.260 --> 1:33:24.860\n with disappearing.\n\n1:33:24.860 --> 1:33:28.300\n Like our, the way we draw meaning from life\n\n1:33:28.300 --> 1:33:30.860\n seems to be grounded in the fact that we exist\n\n1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:34.620\n and that we at some point will not exist is terrifying.\n\n1:33:34.620 --> 1:33:37.660\n And so we live in an illusion that we're not going to die\n\n1:33:37.660 --> 1:33:39.700\n and we run from that terror.\n\n1:33:39.700 --> 1:33:41.740\n That's what Ernest Becker would say.\n\n1:33:41.740 --> 1:33:44.260\n Do you think there's any truth to that?\n\n1:33:44.260 --> 1:33:45.460\n Oh, I know there's truth to that.\n\n1:33:45.460 --> 1:33:47.820\n I experience it every day when I talk to people.\n\n1:33:47.820 --> 1:33:49.700\n We have to live that way.\n\n1:33:49.700 --> 1:33:51.420\n Although unfortunately I can't,\n\n1:33:51.420 --> 1:33:56.420\n but for most people it's extremely distressing\n\n1:33:56.540 --> 1:33:59.380\n to think about their own mortality.\n\n1:33:59.380 --> 1:34:00.580\n We think about it occasionally.\n\n1:34:00.580 --> 1:34:02.300\n And if we really thought about it every day,\n\n1:34:02.300 --> 1:34:04.020\n we'd probably be brought to tears.\n\n1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:05.780\n How much we not just miss ourselves,\n\n1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:07.580\n but miss our family, our friends.\n\n1:34:10.140 --> 1:34:14.420\n All living life forms have evolved to not want to die.\n\n1:34:14.420 --> 1:34:15.680\n And when I mean want,\n\n1:34:15.680 --> 1:34:18.220\n biochemically, genetically, physically.\n\n1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:21.660\n That yeast cell, the cells that I studied at MIT,\n\n1:34:21.660 --> 1:34:23.700\n they were fighting for their lives.\n\n1:34:23.700 --> 1:34:25.260\n They didn't think,\n\n1:34:25.260 --> 1:34:28.980\n but our brain has evolved the same survival aspect.\n\n1:34:28.980 --> 1:34:30.380\n Of course, we don't want to die.\n\n1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:32.540\n But the problem for us, unfortunately,\n\n1:34:32.540 --> 1:34:34.960\n it's a curse and a blessing is that we're now conscious.\n\n1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.180\n We know that we're going to die.\n\n1:34:37.180 --> 1:34:40.300\n Most species that have ever existed don't.\n\n1:34:40.300 --> 1:34:42.300\n That's a burden, that's a curse.\n\n1:34:42.300 --> 1:34:43.660\n And so what I think has happened is\n\n1:34:43.660 --> 1:34:46.900\n we've evolved certainly to want to live for a long time,\n\n1:34:46.900 --> 1:34:49.140\n perhaps never want to die.\n\n1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:52.160\n But the thought about dying is so traumatic\n\n1:34:52.160 --> 1:34:55.620\n that there is an innate part of our brains.\n\n1:34:55.620 --> 1:34:59.260\n And it's probably genetically wired to not think about it.\n\n1:35:00.940 --> 1:35:03.180\n I really think that's part of being human.\n\n1:35:03.180 --> 1:35:06.020\n Because, think about tribes that obsessed\n\n1:35:06.020 --> 1:35:09.620\n with longevity every day and that we're going to die.\n\n1:35:09.620 --> 1:35:12.300\n They probably didn't make much technological progress\n\n1:35:12.300 --> 1:35:14.540\n because they were just crying in their huts every day\n\n1:35:14.540 --> 1:35:16.220\n or on the Savannah.\n\n1:35:16.220 --> 1:35:18.060\n So I really think that we've evolved\n\n1:35:18.060 --> 1:35:20.340\n to naturally deny aging.\n\n1:35:20.340 --> 1:35:23.180\n And it's one of the problems that I face in my career.\n\n1:35:23.180 --> 1:35:26.780\n And when I speak publicly and on social media\n\n1:35:26.780 --> 1:35:28.340\n is that it's shocking.\n\n1:35:28.340 --> 1:35:29.920\n People don't want to think about their age,\n\n1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:31.720\n but I think it's getting better.\n\n1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:33.940\n I think my book has helped.\n\n1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:35.220\n These tests that we're developing\n\n1:35:35.220 --> 1:35:38.340\n should help people understand it's not a problem\n\n1:35:38.340 --> 1:35:40.300\n to think about your longterm health.\n\n1:35:40.300 --> 1:35:41.820\n In fact, if you don't,\n\n1:35:41.820 --> 1:35:44.060\n you're going to reach 80 and really regret it.\n\n1:35:45.260 --> 1:35:47.740\n And the other side of it, so again, Ernest Becker,\n\n1:35:47.740 --> 1:35:50.140\n but also Viktor Frankl recommended highly\n\n1:35:50.140 --> 1:35:51.340\n Man's Search for Meaning.\n\n1:35:52.300 --> 1:35:54.900\n Bernard Williams is a moral philosopher.\n\n1:35:54.900 --> 1:35:58.620\n They kind of argue that this knowledge of death,\n\n1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:03.620\n even if we often don't contemplate it, we do at times.\n\n1:36:03.840 --> 1:36:06.960\n And the very, what you call the curse,\n\n1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:10.620\n which I agree with you, it's a curse and a blessing\n\n1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:13.900\n that we're able to contemplate our own mortality.\n\n1:36:13.900 --> 1:36:16.580\n That gives meaning to life.\n\n1:36:16.580 --> 1:36:18.860\n So death gives meaning to life,\n\n1:36:18.860 --> 1:36:21.140\n is what Viktor Frankl argues.\n\n1:36:21.140 --> 1:36:22.600\n I would probably argue the same.\n\n1:36:22.600 --> 1:36:25.180\n There's something about the scarcity of life\n\n1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:27.140\n and contemplating that,\n\n1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:30.180\n that makes each moment that much sweeter.\n\n1:36:30.180 --> 1:36:32.380\n Is there something to that?\n\n1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:33.860\n I think it's individual.\n\n1:36:33.860 --> 1:36:35.980\n In my case, it's completely wrong.\n\n1:36:35.980 --> 1:36:39.820\n I appreciate you saying that.\n\n1:36:39.820 --> 1:36:41.860\n I don't get joy out of every day\n\n1:36:41.860 --> 1:36:43.780\n because I think I'm going to die.\n\n1:36:43.780 --> 1:36:46.060\n I get joy out of every day because every day is joyous\n\n1:36:46.060 --> 1:36:47.460\n and I make it that way.\n\n1:36:47.460 --> 1:36:50.460\n And even if I thought I was going to live forever,\n\n1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:53.140\n I would still be enjoying this moment just as much.\n\n1:36:54.580 --> 1:36:56.340\n And I bet you would too.\n\n1:36:56.340 --> 1:36:59.900\n Well, I think about that a lot.\n\n1:36:59.900 --> 1:37:03.580\n I think it's very difficult to know.\n\n1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:06.740\n I'm almost afraid that I wouldn't enjoy it as much\n\n1:37:06.740 --> 1:37:07.980\n if I was immortal.\n\n1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:11.900\n I'm almost afraid to want to be immortal or to live longer\n\n1:37:11.900 --> 1:37:16.900\n because it perhaps is a kind of justification\n\n1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:21.700\n for me to accept that I'm going to die.\n\n1:37:21.700 --> 1:37:23.420\n It's saying like, oh, if I was immortal,\n\n1:37:23.420 --> 1:37:26.160\n I wouldn't be able to enjoy life as much as I do.\n\n1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:29.240\n But it's very possible that I would enjoy just as much.\n\n1:37:30.260 --> 1:37:34.220\n Of course, enjoying life, whether you're immortal or not,\n\n1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:35.540\n takes work.\n\n1:37:35.540 --> 1:37:38.580\n Like it requires you to have the right kind\n\n1:37:38.580 --> 1:37:39.820\n of frame of mind.\n\n1:37:39.820 --> 1:37:42.460\n You can discover, you can focus your mind\n\n1:37:42.460 --> 1:37:44.500\n on the ugliness of life.\n\n1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.900\n There's plenty of ugly things in this world\n\n1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:47.960\n and you can focus on them.\n\n1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:49.340\n You can complain.\n\n1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:53.460\n Whenever like, you know, if it's raining outside,\n\n1:37:53.460 --> 1:37:56.740\n you can focus on the fact that you have shelter\n\n1:37:56.740 --> 1:37:58.460\n and enjoy the hell out of it.\n\n1:37:58.460 --> 1:38:02.020\n Or you can enjoy running in the rain when it's warm\n\n1:38:02.020 --> 1:38:05.700\n and the beauty of nature, just being one with nature.\n\n1:38:05.700 --> 1:38:07.920\n Or you can just complain, it's fucking weather again\n\n1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:10.420\n in Boston and then it's either always raining\n\n1:38:10.420 --> 1:38:11.920\n or freezing, damn it.\n\n1:38:13.920 --> 1:38:18.340\n The same thing with like wifi going out on airplanes.\n\n1:38:18.340 --> 1:38:23.340\n You can either complain about stupid wifi\n\n1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:25.860\n on JetBlue or something.\n\n1:38:25.860 --> 1:38:27.620\n Or you could say like, how incredible it is\n\n1:38:27.620 --> 1:38:30.180\n that I can fly through the sky and in a matter of hours\n\n1:38:30.180 --> 1:38:31.700\n be anywhere else in the world.\n\n1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:35.700\n And then I could also on occasion watch like check email\n\n1:38:35.700 --> 1:38:39.540\n and even watch movies while connecting through satellites\n\n1:38:39.540 --> 1:38:40.500\n that are flying through space.\n\n1:38:40.500 --> 1:38:42.780\n So it's a matter of perspective and perhaps\n\n1:38:42.780 --> 1:38:44.980\n there's an extra level of work required\n\n1:38:44.980 --> 1:38:47.620\n when you're immortal because it's easier\n\n1:38:47.620 --> 1:38:51.680\n when you're immortal or live longer to be lazy,\n\n1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:52.980\n to delay stuff.\n\n1:38:52.980 --> 1:38:55.020\n But if you're not, you can still derive\n\n1:38:55.020 --> 1:38:56.460\n the same amount of joy.\n\n1:38:56.460 --> 1:38:59.060\n It's possible, it's possible.\n\n1:38:59.060 --> 1:38:59.900\n It's definitely possible.\n\n1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:03.120\n In my life, I went from being the nothing's working\n\n1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:06.660\n to every day's great to wake up to.\n\n1:39:06.660 --> 1:39:10.460\n And I think even if you think you can live forever,\n\n1:39:10.460 --> 1:39:12.180\n you can enjoy every day.\n\n1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:14.040\n What I do is everything's relative.\n\n1:39:14.940 --> 1:39:17.900\n We can compare ourselves to our neighbor who has more money\n\n1:39:17.900 --> 1:39:20.460\n or to the flight that should have had wifi\n\n1:39:20.460 --> 1:39:23.580\n or which is what I do, I'm still six years old remember.\n\n1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:27.780\n What a six year old does says, look, I can,\n\n1:39:27.780 --> 1:39:29.940\n when I tell my fingers to form a fist,\n\n1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:31.300\n they actually do that.\n\n1:39:31.300 --> 1:39:32.700\n That's really cool.\n\n1:39:32.700 --> 1:39:34.740\n That's how I live my life.\n\n1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:36.840\n I can pick up on your desk here, this metal object.\n\n1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:39.860\n It's a metal cube, about an inch by an inch by an inch.\n\n1:39:39.860 --> 1:39:42.560\n And I tell myself not about cubes,\n\n1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:44.920\n but about inanimate objects.\n\n1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:48.260\n Probably once a day I'll say, I'm a living thing.\n\n1:39:48.260 --> 1:39:51.880\n I can think, I can move, I can eat, I am full of energy.\n\n1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:53.920\n And there's that leaf or this cube here\n\n1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:55.840\n that will never be alive.\n\n1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:59.180\n That's what I look at and compare myself to.\n\n1:39:59.180 --> 1:40:01.100\n And for as long as I live, if it's forever,\n\n1:40:01.100 --> 1:40:04.500\n of course it won't be, but even if it was forever,\n\n1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:07.780\n relative to this lump of metal on this table here,\n\n1:40:07.780 --> 1:40:10.860\n we are wondrous things in the universe\n\n1:40:10.860 --> 1:40:13.740\n and probably the most wondrous things in the universe.\n\n1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:18.660\n Yeah, we're able to deeply appreciate the leaf or the cube\n\n1:40:18.660 --> 1:40:20.540\n and deeply appreciate ourselves,\n\n1:40:20.540 --> 1:40:24.400\n which is, it can be a curse, but it's mostly a gift,\n\n1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.140\n especially when you're, it's such a beautiful poem.\n\n1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:31.640\n Now I'm six, I'm as clever as clever,\n\n1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:35.380\n so I think I'll be six now forever and ever.\n\n1:40:35.380 --> 1:40:37.840\n That's a good thing to aspire to.\n\n1:40:37.840 --> 1:40:40.600\n Your grandmother was onto something.\n\n1:40:40.600 --> 1:40:43.000\n David, this is an incredible conversation.\n\n1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:44.620\n I'm a huge fan of your work.\n\n1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:49.320\n So thank you for wasting your valuable time with me today.\n\n1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:50.480\n I really, really appreciate it.\n\n1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:51.320\n This was awesome.\n\n1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:53.960\n Thank you for having me on, Lex, appreciate it.\n\n1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:55.480\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n1:40:55.480 --> 1:40:59.720\n with David Sinclair, and thank you to Onnit, Clear,\n\n1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:03.600\n National Instruments, Simply Safe, and Linode.\n\n1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:07.100\n Check them out in the description to support this podcast.\n\n1:41:07.100 --> 1:41:08.680\n And now let me leave you with some words\n\n1:41:08.680 --> 1:41:10.600\n from Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\n1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.660\n All truth passes through three stages.\n\n1:41:13.660 --> 1:41:15.460\n First, it is ridiculed.\n\n1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:18.200\n Second, it is violently opposed.\n\n1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:22.240\n Third, it is accepted as being self evident.\n\n1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:26.400\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
