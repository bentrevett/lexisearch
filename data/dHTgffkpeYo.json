off\n\n00:09.440 --> 00:10.960\n and people would jump off\n\n00:10.960 --> 00:13.200\n and people would fall into the water\n\n00:13.200 --> 00:17.480\n and some of them couldn't swim.\n\n00:18.720 --> 00:21.200\n And so we found ourselves in this moment\n\n00:21.200 --> 00:23.040\n where we had a choice.\n\n00:23.040 --> 00:26.240\n We could film someone drown in front of us\n\n00:26.240 --> 00:27.960\n or we could put our cameras down\n\n00:27.960 --> 00:30.120\n and pull them out of the water.\n\n00:31.440 --> 00:34.240\n The following is a conversation with Sky Fitzgerald,\n\n00:34.240 --> 00:37.120\n a two time Oscar nominated documentary filmmaker\n\n00:37.120 --> 00:41.120\n who made the films Hunger Ward, about the war in Yemen,\n\n00:41.120 --> 00:44.040\n Lifeboat, about the search and rescue operations\n\n00:44.040 --> 00:45.640\n off the coast of Libya,\n\n00:45.640 --> 00:50.640\n and 50 Feet from Syria, about the war in Syria.\n\n00:51.120 --> 00:53.120\n This is the Lex Friedman podcast.\n\n00:53.120 --> 00:55.280\n To support it, please check out our sponsors\n\n00:55.280 --> 00:56.480\n in the description.\n\n00:56.480 --> 00:59.920\n Now, dear friends, here's Sky Fitzgerald.\n\n01:00.800 --> 01:05.520\n Nearly 811 million people worldwide are hungry today\n\n01:05.520 --> 01:08.440\n and 45 million people are on the edge of famine\n\n01:08.440 --> 01:10.160\n across 43 countries.\n\n01:11.440 --> 01:12.360\n How do you feel?\n\n01:12.360 --> 01:14.680\n How do you make sense of that many people suffering\n\n01:14.680 --> 01:17.280\n from hunger and famine in the world today?\n\n01:17.280 --> 01:20.080\n I don't know if I can make sense of it, Lex.\n\n01:20.080 --> 01:25.080\n I mean, I think it's deeply disturbing to me\n\n01:25.080 --> 01:29.120\n that as a global community, we've allowed this number\n\n01:29.120 --> 01:34.120\n of people to go hungry when the food to feed them exists\n\n01:34.120 --> 01:37.080\n and the resources to feed them exists.\n\n01:37.080 --> 01:41.360\n I think the thing that disturbs me most about those figures\n\n01:41.360 --> 01:46.360\n is that many of those who are starving today\n\n01:46.360 --> 01:51.360\n or going hungry today are the net result of war\n\n01:51.360 --> 01:56.040\n and intentional acts by leaders to starve entire populations.\n\n01:56.040 --> 01:58.760\n And that's the most deeply disturbing part to me.\n\n02:00.160 --> 02:05.160\n You know your history and we all know that deeply embedded\n\n02:06.120 --> 02:09.560\n in the Geneva Conventions post World War II,\n\n02:09.560 --> 02:13.280\n the intent of one of those articles was to ban the use\n\n02:13.280 --> 02:17.480\n of starvation as a weapon of war because of what Hitler did\n\n02:17.480 --> 02:19.600\n during World War II.\n\n02:19.600 --> 02:23.400\n That's been reiterated multiple times over the years\n\n02:23.400 --> 02:27.040\n in international humanitarian law, including in 2018\n\n02:27.040 --> 02:29.800\n because of the Saudi blockade over Yemen.\n\n02:29.800 --> 02:33.680\n And yet to this day, starvation as a weapon of war\n\n02:33.680 --> 02:36.200\n continues to be used in Ethiopia,\n\n02:36.200 --> 02:39.080\n obviously in Ukraine right now and in Yemen\n\n02:39.080 --> 02:40.440\n with the blockade over the country.\n\n02:40.440 --> 02:43.880\n And that disgusts me that the law is in place\n\n02:43.880 --> 02:46.240\n but it won't be enforced by the international bodies\n\n02:46.240 --> 02:47.840\n and the nation states that make up\n\n02:47.840 --> 02:49.160\n the international community.\n\n02:49.160 --> 02:54.160\n So when the starvation is a result of human actions,\n\n02:55.000 --> 02:59.240\n human decisions, that it's especially painful\n\n02:59.240 --> 03:00.520\n to make sense of.\n\n03:00.520 --> 03:02.480\n For me personally, yeah.\n\n03:02.480 --> 03:05.040\n I think that if you and I sit in here,\n\n03:05.040 --> 03:10.000\n didn't eat for three days and had to lay our head\n\n03:10.000 --> 03:12.600\n on the sidewalk for a couple nights,\n\n03:12.600 --> 03:17.600\n I think we would take hunger and homelessness\n\n03:17.600 --> 03:19.160\n a lot more seriously.\n\n03:19.160 --> 03:22.240\n And I think that's, for some reason,\n\n03:22.240 --> 03:25.560\n that's missing at this moment in history, tragically.\n\n03:25.560 --> 03:29.240\n And I think until that we can generate enough empathy,\n\n03:30.120 --> 03:32.360\n that's immediate for all of us to understand\n\n03:32.360 --> 03:34.080\n what that means to go hungry.\n\n03:34.080 --> 03:36.480\n I'm not sure we're gonna sort of marshal\n\n03:36.480 --> 03:39.480\n the global community to solve it.\n\n03:39.480 --> 03:44.480\n I did just that by the way, fasted for three days recently.\n\n03:44.640 --> 03:47.360\n It was fundamentally different, I think,\n\n03:47.360 --> 03:51.840\n because the thing that would be terrifying to me\n\n03:51.840 --> 03:54.040\n is not the fasting, but the hopelessness\n\n03:54.040 --> 03:55.400\n at the end of the fasting.\n\n03:55.400 --> 03:58.880\n Like I wouldn't know when the next meal is coming.\n\n03:58.880 --> 04:01.360\n I always had the freedom to have the meal.\n\n04:01.360 --> 04:06.360\n The fear, not just your own ability to eat and survive,\n\n04:06.960 --> 04:07.800\n but your family's.\n\n04:07.800 --> 04:10.400\n If there's loved ones, that's the other thing I don't have.\n\n04:10.400 --> 04:11.520\n I'm single.\n\n04:11.520 --> 04:14.800\n So I feel like the worst suffering\n\n04:14.800 --> 04:17.520\n is watching somebody you love\n\n04:17.520 --> 04:20.040\n that you're supposed to be a caretaker of\n\n04:20.040 --> 04:21.720\n and you can't take care of them.\n\n04:23.960 --> 04:27.160\n And if all of that is caused by leaders\n\n04:30.640 --> 04:35.520\n as a weapon of war, that is especially painful.\n\n04:35.520 --> 04:39.720\n So how can we help?\n\n04:41.360 --> 04:42.760\n What are the ways to help?\n\n04:42.760 --> 04:46.440\n How do we alleviate this suffering?\n\n04:48.360 --> 04:52.800\n Well, I think on the humanitarian front,\n\n04:52.800 --> 04:56.520\n we have to be aggressive and attentive\n\n04:56.520 --> 04:59.240\n and intervene in significant ways.\n\n04:59.240 --> 05:01.720\n And I think on the political front,\n\n05:01.720 --> 05:06.600\n we have to hold players accountable for their actions.\n\n05:06.600 --> 05:08.320\n So the leaders that start the war.\n\n05:08.320 --> 05:10.360\n So when you say we have to speak up\n\n05:10.360 --> 05:14.160\n about the decisions and the humans making those decisions\n\n05:14.160 --> 05:15.520\n that lead to the starvation.\n\n05:15.520 --> 05:17.160\n For example, let's make it concrete.\n\n05:17.160 --> 05:20.200\n So when I was, I don't wanna jump ahead,\n\n05:20.200 --> 05:22.520\n but when I was filming Hunger Ward in Yemen,\n\n05:25.000 --> 05:30.000\n I met a mother who, when she gave birth, weighed 70 pounds.\n\n05:32.120 --> 05:34.440\n The mother weighed 70 pounds.\n\n05:34.440 --> 05:39.440\n And so her daughter was starved in the womb.\n\n05:42.400 --> 05:46.560\n When she was born, she was born into a world\n\n05:46.560 --> 05:50.120\n with no breast milk, very little formula.\n\n05:50.120 --> 05:52.360\n So she was starved before birth.\n\n05:52.360 --> 05:56.640\n She was born into a world where she continued to be starved\n\n05:56.640 --> 06:00.000\n by a mother who herself was starved.\n\n06:00.000 --> 06:05.000\n I watched that child, her name is Asila, die in front of me.\n\n06:05.840 --> 06:10.720\n Asila had no chance for all those things we hope for,\n\n06:10.720 --> 06:12.560\n for a child in this world.\n\n06:12.560 --> 06:14.400\n She didn't have a chance to grow up.\n\n06:14.400 --> 06:16.760\n She didn't have a chance to discover love.\n\n06:16.760 --> 06:19.040\n She didn't have a chance to have a career.\n\n06:19.040 --> 06:22.200\n She was robbed of all of those things\n\n06:22.200 --> 06:24.440\n because of the insidious nature of hunger\n\n06:24.440 --> 06:26.320\n that she was born into.\n\n06:26.320 --> 06:31.320\n She didn't have to die, she was not starving.\n\n06:32.640 --> 06:34.840\n Her mother was being starved\n\n06:34.840 --> 06:37.040\n because of the blockade over the country.\n\n06:37.040 --> 06:38.840\n Now, who instituted that blockade?\n\n06:39.760 --> 06:43.880\n MBS in Saudi Arabia with the reinforcement\n\n06:43.880 --> 06:46.400\n and sort of tacit approval of the United States,\n\n06:46.400 --> 06:48.520\n our own government here.\n\n06:48.520 --> 06:51.360\n And so there are people who are responsible\n\n06:51.360 --> 06:52.800\n for the starvation of children\n\n06:52.800 --> 06:55.520\n and I think we need to hold them accountable.\n\n06:55.520 --> 06:58.520\n Now, that's incredibly difficult to do,\n\n06:58.520 --> 07:00.200\n but just because it's difficult\n\n07:00.200 --> 07:02.480\n doesn't mean it ought not to be done.\n\n07:03.320 --> 07:06.840\n And we'll talk about many cases like these\n\n07:06.840 --> 07:08.960\n throughout history and going on today.\n\n07:08.960 --> 07:10.440\n Let's talk about Hunger Ward.\n\n07:10.440 --> 07:11.280\n Let's dive in.\n\n07:12.920 --> 07:14.840\n You've been nominated for an Oscar twice.\n\n07:14.840 --> 07:19.440\n This is one of the times for a documentary.\n\n07:21.080 --> 07:24.160\n Can you please tell me what Hunger Ward,\n\n07:24.160 --> 07:27.360\n The Last Hope Between War and Starvation is about?\n\n07:27.360 --> 07:29.560\n Hunger Ward is a short documentary\n\n07:31.080 --> 07:34.640\n that really is an attempt to illustrate\n\n07:34.640 --> 07:38.240\n the effects of the conflict on Yemen,\n\n07:38.240 --> 07:40.200\n specifically on civilians.\n\n07:40.200 --> 07:43.720\n And we document it in both the north\n\n07:43.720 --> 07:44.720\n and the south of the country\n\n07:44.720 --> 07:46.680\n because it's a bifurcated country.\n\n07:46.680 --> 07:50.240\n The south is held by the globally recognized government\n\n07:50.240 --> 07:52.320\n in the south, which up until last week\n\n07:52.320 --> 07:56.200\n was run by, at least on the surface,\n\n07:56.200 --> 08:00.040\n by President Hadi holed up in Riyadh.\n\n08:00.040 --> 08:05.040\n He was essentially removed from office last week\n\n08:05.120 --> 08:08.360\n by, most people would agree,\n\n08:08.360 --> 08:10.400\n the Emiratis and the Saudis\n\n08:10.400 --> 08:12.640\n to put in place a presidential council.\n\n08:12.640 --> 08:16.400\n So we wanted to show that starvation was happening\n\n08:16.400 --> 08:19.680\n in very similar fashions, both in the south and the north.\n\n08:19.680 --> 08:22.400\n And we wanted to do this film\n\n08:22.400 --> 08:26.040\n because so few people in the west\n\n08:26.040 --> 08:29.000\n know anything about the conflict in Yemen,\n\n08:29.000 --> 08:32.640\n nor the US's complicity in it.\n\n08:32.640 --> 08:34.240\n And so my intent with the project\n\n08:34.240 --> 08:36.680\n was try to bring it to a larger western audience\n\n08:36.680 --> 08:38.360\n as an attempt to intervene\n\n08:38.360 --> 08:40.120\n and change the political status quo,\n\n08:40.120 --> 08:44.560\n which allows the use of starvation in Yemen to continue.\n\n08:44.560 --> 08:49.160\n So US complicity, who are the bad guys?\n\n08:49.160 --> 08:52.480\n Now, the world, unfortunately,\n\n08:52.480 --> 08:54.400\n cannot be painted in black and white\n\n08:54.400 --> 08:56.640\n of good guys and bad guys.\n\n08:56.640 --> 08:59.640\n But for the purpose of conversation,\n\n08:59.640 --> 09:04.640\n who is causing suffering in the world in this situation?\n\n09:06.160 --> 09:07.320\n Who started the war?\n\n09:07.320 --> 09:08.160\n Why?\n\n09:09.480 --> 09:14.280\n And then, of course, the roots of war go back in history.\n\n09:14.280 --> 09:17.560\n But let's start at the top.\n\n09:17.560 --> 09:20.640\n Well, there are bad actors and there are less bad actors.\n\n09:20.640 --> 09:22.840\n I mean, I think that's always the case in war, probably.\n\n09:22.840 --> 09:24.520\n And everybody loses in war.\n\n09:24.520 --> 09:27.080\n Yeah, I concur with that statement.\n\n09:28.000 --> 09:33.080\n In the case of the status quo in Yemen right now,\n\n09:33.080 --> 09:35.960\n it's a completely asymmetrical war.\n\n09:35.960 --> 09:38.080\n And so the Saudi coalition,\n\n09:38.080 --> 09:41.280\n which is made up of primarily Saudi Arabia,\n\n09:41.280 --> 09:46.280\n the Emiratis, United States, France, Britain,\n\n09:46.280 --> 09:49.280\n supplying weapons, but it's really driven\n\n09:49.280 --> 09:51.360\n and catalyzed by Saudi Arabia.\n\n09:52.360 --> 09:54.880\n And it's asymmetrical to a great extent\n\n09:54.880 --> 09:58.680\n just because of the incredible firepower by air\n\n09:58.680 --> 10:03.680\n that the Saudis use continuously to pummel Northern Yemen.\n\n10:04.720 --> 10:08.960\n When I was there, the sheer volume of airstrikes\n\n10:08.960 --> 10:10.680\n is hard to describe.\n\n10:10.680 --> 10:14.840\n And we show the result of only one in the film, really.\n\n10:14.840 --> 10:16.200\n But it's an asymmetrical war.\n\n10:16.200 --> 10:18.520\n The de facto authorities of the North,\n\n10:18.520 --> 10:21.000\n Ansar Allah, also known as the Houthi rebel group,\n\n10:23.400 --> 10:25.080\n they don't have an air force, right?\n\n10:25.080 --> 10:27.600\n They have a drone force, but they don't have an air force.\n\n10:27.600 --> 10:29.800\n And so from a military standpoint,\n\n10:29.800 --> 10:31.760\n it's completely asymmetrical.\n\n10:31.760 --> 10:34.560\n The Saudis really don't commit troops to the ground.\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:37.080\n They use only proxies to fight on the ground.\n\n10:37.080 --> 10:42.080\n What is the narrative they use to justify war?\n\n10:42.080 --> 10:46.320\n So there's a story on every side in war.\n\n10:46.320 --> 10:49.040\n Some of it is grounded in truth.\n\n10:49.040 --> 10:52.040\n Some of it is not at all grounded in truth,\n\n10:52.040 --> 10:54.040\n also known as propaganda.\n\n10:54.040 --> 10:57.600\n What's the narrative used by the Saudis for this war?\n\n10:58.440 --> 11:01.720\n The Saudi line is essentially that the Houthis\n\n11:01.720 --> 11:03.240\n are an illegitimate government,\n\n11:04.400 --> 11:08.680\n and that it's really a proxy war between Iran,\n\n11:08.680 --> 11:10.640\n who supports the Houthis nominally,\n\n11:10.640 --> 11:12.280\n and the rest of the world.\n\n11:12.280 --> 11:14.000\n That's the Saudi narrative.\n\n11:14.000 --> 11:16.320\n The reality is something altogether different.\n\n11:16.320 --> 11:19.600\n While the Houthis do receive support from Iran,\n\n11:19.600 --> 11:24.600\n this is a war started by and sustained by MBS in Saudi Arabia.\n\n11:25.000 --> 11:25.840\n Who's MBS?\n\n11:25.840 --> 11:27.400\n Mohammed bin Salman.\n\n11:27.400 --> 11:28.240\n And who is he?\n\n11:28.240 --> 11:32.200\n He is the son of the ruler of Saudi Arabia.\n\n11:32.200 --> 11:33.720\n What's his power?\n\n11:33.720 --> 11:35.720\n I'm asking basic dumb questions.\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:37.360\n He's the de facto ruler.\n\n11:37.360 --> 11:39.040\n Of the military and the...\n\n11:39.040 --> 11:42.800\n Yes, he seized control of the country several years ago,\n\n11:42.800 --> 11:44.560\n even though he, on the surface,\n\n11:44.560 --> 11:46.720\n is not the ruler of Saudi Arabia, he is.\n\n11:46.720 --> 11:47.560\n He's the crown prince.\n\n11:47.560 --> 11:52.560\n I'm sorry to interrupt often, but who is he as a man?\n\n11:52.680 --> 11:53.520\n What's your sense of the...\n\n11:53.520 --> 11:55.440\n Yeah, so I've never met him,\n\n11:55.440 --> 11:58.480\n and I likely will never meet him, hopefully.\n\n11:59.880 --> 12:03.480\n But he is, I know a lot about him through his actions,\n\n12:03.480 --> 12:05.400\n sort of in the MENA region,\n\n12:05.400 --> 12:07.880\n Middle East and North Africa region.\n\n12:07.880 --> 12:12.320\n And he is one of three, in my view,\n\n12:12.320 --> 12:14.720\n as an American sitting here in the US,\n\n12:14.720 --> 12:18.400\n three people in the world that I think\n\n12:18.400 --> 12:23.280\n has caused such an incredible volume of misery\n\n12:23.280 --> 12:27.040\n and suffering and murder on this planet\n\n12:27.040 --> 12:32.040\n that I think if he weren't around,\n\n12:33.720 --> 12:35.320\n the world would be a lot better place.\n\n12:35.320 --> 12:37.480\n And I'm not a violent person by nature,\n\n12:37.480 --> 12:39.120\n but there are three human beings\n\n12:39.120 --> 12:42.680\n that I think the world would be better off without.\n\n12:42.680 --> 12:45.360\n Do you mind, before I ask other questions,\n\n12:45.360 --> 12:46.800\n mentioning the three?\n\n12:46.800 --> 12:49.920\n Oh, yeah, Assad is one in Syria,\n\n12:49.920 --> 12:51.800\n and that comes out of an earlier project\n\n12:51.800 --> 12:54.000\n that I did in Syria and Turkey,\n\n12:54.000 --> 12:59.000\n and what I saw Assad as a ruler do to his own people.\n\n13:01.200 --> 13:03.520\n And Putin would be the third.\n\n13:03.520 --> 13:08.520\n Those three human beings are murderers on a scale\n\n13:08.680 --> 13:11.600\n beyond imagining.\n\n13:11.600 --> 13:16.120\n On MBS, are you able to think as a documentary filmmaker,\n\n13:16.120 --> 13:19.040\n as a human being, as a scholar, as a thinker,\n\n13:19.040 --> 13:22.040\n with an open mind about a man like that\n\n13:22.040 --> 13:23.760\n who does evil onto the world,\n\n13:23.760 --> 13:25.960\n and what that must feel like\n\n13:25.960 --> 13:28.040\n to be inside the mind of that man?\n\n13:28.040 --> 13:31.720\n So basically, consider his worldview.\n\n13:31.720 --> 13:35.280\n With most evil people, with all people, probably,\n\n13:35.280 --> 13:37.960\n but with people who do evil onto the world,\n\n13:37.960 --> 13:40.160\n they think they're doing good.\n\n13:40.160 --> 13:41.560\n They're the hero of their own story.\n\n13:41.560 --> 13:45.120\n Right, and so to be able to place yourself,\n\n13:45.120 --> 13:47.840\n I feel like, for me, to understand a person,\n\n13:47.840 --> 13:51.160\n I have to literally, like the way actors\n\n13:51.160 --> 13:54.200\n kind of have to do, you know,\n\n13:54.200 --> 13:57.200\n live inside the body of the person they're trying to study.\n\n13:57.200 --> 13:58.120\n Inhabit the character.\n\n13:58.120 --> 13:59.600\n Inhabit the person.\n\n13:59.600 --> 14:02.480\n So are you able to do that, or because you\n\n14:03.600 --> 14:06.600\n are also studying the people who suffer\n\n14:06.600 --> 14:10.000\n as a result, as a consequence of their actions,\n\n14:10.000 --> 14:13.040\n you just, you put them in a box,\n\n14:13.040 --> 14:15.160\n and you say, I hate the person in that box.\n\n14:15.160 --> 14:17.840\n I'm going to move on.\n\n14:17.840 --> 14:19.680\n This goes back to your black and white statement\n\n14:19.680 --> 14:20.680\n at the beginning, right?\n\n14:20.680 --> 14:23.920\n It's like, the world as a whole, of course,\n\n14:23.920 --> 14:26.920\n you know, is every gradation of gray, right?\n\n14:26.920 --> 14:29.040\n My background is theater, Lex,\n\n14:29.040 --> 14:32.400\n and so I was trained long before I picked up a camera\n\n14:32.400 --> 14:34.200\n to inhabit other characters, right?\n\n14:34.200 --> 14:36.160\n I have two degrees in theater,\n\n14:36.160 --> 14:38.520\n and so that level of sort of like\n\n14:38.520 --> 14:40.160\n walking in other people's shoes\n\n14:40.160 --> 14:42.280\n and trying to understand and empathize\n\n14:42.280 --> 14:45.120\n with their worldview is fundamental\n\n14:45.120 --> 14:47.960\n to how I live my life and how I do my work.\n\n14:47.960 --> 14:50.160\n So in the case of those three that I named,\n\n14:50.160 --> 14:53.520\n Assad, MBS, and Putin, yeah, I can go there\n\n14:53.520 --> 14:55.600\n and think through how they came to be,\n\n14:55.600 --> 14:59.360\n who they are, right, from afar, right?\n\n14:59.360 --> 15:01.880\n And after I go through that process,\n\n15:02.720 --> 15:04.920\n I still don't think there's any way\n\n15:04.920 --> 15:08.520\n that one can justify what they've done.\n\n15:10.040 --> 15:14.440\n We're going to talk about each of those people, for sure.\n\n15:14.440 --> 15:16.960\n Well, I'm not an expert on any of them.\n\n15:16.960 --> 15:17.920\n Well, you're a human being,\n\n15:17.920 --> 15:22.920\n which makes you a partial expert on human nature\n\n15:23.280 --> 15:24.400\n because nobody's an expert.\n\n15:24.400 --> 15:26.360\n You're just as good as anyone else.\n\n15:26.360 --> 15:28.680\n Anybody who actually carries a camera\n\n15:28.680 --> 15:31.640\n and listens and observe others\n\n15:31.640 --> 15:34.160\n isn't especially an expert of human nature.\n\n15:35.360 --> 15:37.560\n Who's willing to take that leap\n\n15:37.560 --> 15:41.320\n and truly understand somebody of any level, not leaders.\n\n15:41.320 --> 15:42.640\n I feel like to understand a leader,\n\n15:42.640 --> 15:45.040\n you have to first understand humans,\n\n15:45.040 --> 15:47.160\n and to understand humans, you have to see humans\n\n15:47.160 --> 15:49.240\n at their worst and their best,\n\n15:49.240 --> 15:52.280\n which is something that you've definitely done.\n\n15:52.280 --> 15:54.440\n So let's stick on Hunger Ward.\n\n15:54.440 --> 15:56.880\n This lens that you've chosen to look at this\n\n15:56.880 --> 16:00.560\n is through a single, maybe you can speak to that.\n\n16:00.560 --> 16:05.560\n You've mentioned the starvation as a result of war.\n\n16:06.560 --> 16:08.480\n What is the documentary?\n\n16:08.480 --> 16:10.000\n Like, what is the lens you've chosen\n\n16:10.000 --> 16:14.600\n to give the world a peek at the results,\n\n16:14.600 --> 16:17.000\n at the suffering that's a result of this war?\n\n16:18.120 --> 16:19.760\n People a lot of times will ask me\n\n16:19.760 --> 16:22.520\n if they've seen Hunger Ward, you know.\n\n16:24.200 --> 16:26.760\n They ask where the hope is, right?\n\n16:26.760 --> 16:30.720\n You read the byline earlier, The Lost Hope.\n\n16:32.320 --> 16:37.320\n And what I try to focus on in many of my films,\n\n16:37.440 --> 16:42.440\n including Hunger Ward, is in the very difficult context\n\n16:42.720 --> 16:47.760\n of war, as the case is in Hunger Ward in Yemen,\n\n16:47.760 --> 16:50.360\n I look for hope, and I look for inspiration,\n\n16:50.360 --> 16:54.280\n and I do that through people who are doing incredible things\n\n16:54.280 --> 16:56.720\n under the most difficult circumstances.\n\n16:56.720 --> 16:59.760\n So when I set out to do a film\n\n16:59.760 --> 17:04.080\n about starvation in Yemen, right?\n\n17:04.080 --> 17:06.240\n I mean, just listen to that statement.\n\n17:06.240 --> 17:08.000\n Where's the hope there, right?\n\n17:08.000 --> 17:11.480\n And yet what I found, what I discovered,\n\n17:11.480 --> 17:14.320\n were human beings that we could tell the story through\n\n17:14.320 --> 17:18.000\n who are incredible, inspirational human beings\n\n17:18.000 --> 17:20.960\n doing amazing things every day.\n\n17:20.960 --> 17:24.880\n One of those is Makiya Maji, a nurse practitioner\n\n17:24.880 --> 17:27.400\n in the north of the country at a small rural clinic.\n\n17:27.400 --> 17:30.040\n And another is Dr. Aida Al Sadiq,\n\n17:30.040 --> 17:33.040\n who's a pediatrician in the south of the country.\n\n17:33.040 --> 17:34.720\n And so we chose to tell the story\n\n17:34.720 --> 17:38.360\n sort of through their experiences as caregivers,\n\n17:38.360 --> 17:43.360\n devoting their lives to try to save this entire cohort,\n\n17:43.360 --> 17:45.760\n this entire generation of children\n\n17:45.760 --> 17:48.760\n that has been born into starvation.\n\n17:48.760 --> 17:52.040\n And that's an incredible, difficult task,\n\n17:52.040 --> 17:56.480\n but equally inspirational to watch these human beings\n\n17:56.480 --> 18:00.400\n devote every minute of every day to save a child.\n\n18:00.400 --> 18:02.200\n I mean, in my view,\n\n18:02.200 --> 18:04.400\n nothing is more important than that action.\n\n18:04.400 --> 18:06.120\n Maybe on that point, real quick.\n\n18:07.560 --> 18:11.400\n So there is suffering at scale, starvation at scale.\n\n18:11.400 --> 18:14.520\n There's, I mean, the numbers,\n\n18:15.680 --> 18:17.080\n maybe you can mention in Yemen,\n\n18:17.080 --> 18:19.400\n what are the numbers in terms of people in starvation,\n\n18:19.400 --> 18:24.200\n but from a perspective of a nurse practitioner or a doctor,\n\n18:24.200 --> 18:27.200\n you always have, you're treating one person in front of you.\n\n18:28.200 --> 18:31.360\n So how do you make sense of that calculus,\n\n18:31.360 --> 18:35.120\n of like there's a huge number of people suffering,\n\n18:35.120 --> 18:37.560\n and then there's just the person in front of you?\n\n18:37.560 --> 18:42.560\n Is that all we can do as humans,\n\n18:43.160 --> 18:45.440\n is just to help one person at a time?\n\n18:45.440 --> 18:49.480\n Is that the right way to think and to approach these problems\n\n18:49.480 --> 18:52.760\n or can you actually make sense of the numbers?\n\n18:52.760 --> 18:55.000\n Speaking just as a human being,\n\n18:55.000 --> 18:58.560\n I think the scale of suffering is so great in Yemen\n\n18:58.560 --> 19:06.960\n that I think I'd be overwhelmed if I focused on that scale.\n\n19:06.960 --> 19:11.120\n You've probably heard that a child dies\n\n19:11.120 --> 19:14.800\n every 75 seconds in Yemen from hunger.\n\n19:14.800 --> 19:16.920\n So we've been sitting here, how long?\n\n19:16.920 --> 19:18.440\n 35 minutes or so.\n\n19:19.680 --> 19:20.920\n That's a good handful of children\n\n19:20.920 --> 19:23.080\n that have already passed away.\n\n19:23.080 --> 19:25.120\n So to overcome sort of, I think,\n\n19:25.120 --> 19:28.600\n that danger of psychic numbing, which can happen\n\n19:28.600 --> 19:32.120\n when you think about suffering on such a large scale,\n\n19:32.120 --> 19:34.800\n as a filmmaker, as a human being,\n\n19:34.800 --> 19:36.680\n I have to focus in on the individuals,\n\n19:36.680 --> 19:38.840\n on those human beings in front of me.\n\n19:38.840 --> 19:41.840\n And I think that's exactly what Dr. Al Sadiq and Makiya do\n\n19:41.840 --> 19:43.480\n to keep going each day.\n\n19:43.480 --> 19:44.840\n And one of the amazing things\n\n19:44.840 --> 19:47.840\n about these two healthcare providers\n\n19:47.840 --> 19:50.200\n that we showcased in the film is that\n\n19:50.200 --> 19:53.800\n they treat anyone who shows up, right?\n\n19:53.800 --> 19:55.840\n They don't have to have money.\n\n19:55.840 --> 19:57.240\n They don't have to have any resources.\n\n19:57.240 --> 20:00.160\n They just have to get to the clinic or the hospital.\n\n20:00.160 --> 20:05.600\n And it's incredibly moving to see sort of the flexibility\n\n20:05.600 --> 20:08.840\n of their thinking in terms of how they make that work.\n\n20:08.840 --> 20:12.280\n Makiya, for example, I saw her in the north of the country.\n\n20:12.280 --> 20:14.640\n It's an incredibly rural clinic that she works at.\n\n20:14.640 --> 20:17.160\n So it's like a magnet for all the cases\n\n20:17.160 --> 20:18.520\n in the north of the country.\n\n20:18.520 --> 20:21.560\n People come from hundreds of kilometers away sometimes\n\n20:21.560 --> 20:25.520\n for specialty treatment of pediatric malnutrition.\n\n20:25.520 --> 20:28.760\n And one time I saw a child come in\n\n20:28.760 --> 20:33.040\n and it was a male relative that brought this young girl in.\n\n20:33.040 --> 20:38.040\n And just because of sort of the gender dynamics in Yemen,\n\n20:38.640 --> 20:42.080\n there had to be a parent or a relative there\n\n20:42.080 --> 20:43.960\n to stay with the child while they're at the clinic.\n\n20:43.960 --> 20:45.560\n And it was a male relative.\n\n20:45.560 --> 20:49.920\n And so what many doctors in that instance would do\n\n20:49.920 --> 20:51.760\n would just turn them away.\n\n20:51.760 --> 20:53.840\n And instead what Makiya did is she walked\n\n20:53.840 --> 20:56.680\n into one of the rooms, talked to one of the other mothers\n\n20:56.680 --> 20:59.400\n and convinced them to become the temporary guardian,\n\n20:59.400 --> 21:01.600\n essentially, of this child\n\n21:01.600 --> 21:04.620\n until a female relative could arrive.\n\n21:04.620 --> 21:06.160\n So, you know, she's flexible.\n\n21:06.160 --> 21:09.360\n She finds solutions rather than allowing the problems\n\n21:09.360 --> 21:11.000\n to deter solutions.\n\n21:11.000 --> 21:12.200\n One child at a time.\n\n21:12.200 --> 21:13.940\n Yeah, yeah, one child at a time.\n\n21:13.940 --> 21:18.940\n You mentioned that you saw a child die in front of you.\n\n21:22.820 --> 21:25.200\n So when you're filming this as a filmmaker,\n\n21:27.000 --> 21:32.000\n what's that like psychologically, philosophically,\n\n21:33.540 --> 21:36.620\n creatively as a filmmaker, as a storyteller?\n\n21:39.660 --> 21:43.860\n What do you do there as a human and as a filmmaker?\n\n21:43.860 --> 21:45.820\n Or what's that whole experience like?\n\n21:45.820 --> 21:47.420\n Because you get to, like you said,\n\n21:47.420 --> 21:49.700\n you take it to the whole journey\n\n21:49.700 --> 21:52.620\n of a starving mother giving birth to a starving child.\n\n21:54.600 --> 21:56.300\n It's not something I want to film.\n\n21:57.460 --> 22:01.740\n It's not something that I certainly wanted to happen\n\n22:01.740 --> 22:05.020\n or seek out, but it happened.\n\n22:05.020 --> 22:07.740\n And the sad truth is that it happens every week\n\n22:07.740 --> 22:09.220\n at that hospital.\n\n22:09.220 --> 22:12.980\n And so when it happened in this instance,\n\n22:12.980 --> 22:15.820\n I felt an incredible responsibility\n\n22:15.820 --> 22:18.880\n to do justice to that reality,\n\n22:18.880 --> 22:22.200\n to acknowledge that a child had just died\n\n22:22.200 --> 22:24.780\n of starvation related causes.\n\n22:26.980 --> 22:31.780\n And to find some way, if the parents wanted us to,\n\n22:31.780 --> 22:34.460\n to integrate that into this story\n\n22:34.460 --> 22:39.360\n we bring back to a Western audience.\n\n22:39.360 --> 22:44.360\n And I've filmed many difficult things over the years.\n\n22:49.460 --> 22:54.260\n And usually I really love filming.\n\n22:54.260 --> 22:56.380\n And I didn't love filming Hunger Ward.\n\n22:56.380 --> 23:00.380\n It was not a process that I enjoyed\n\n23:00.380 --> 23:04.180\n on any way, show, perform, sadly, because of the content.\n\n23:04.180 --> 23:06.860\n Because who wants to watch a child die in front of them?\n\n23:06.860 --> 23:08.820\n I don't, but I did.\n\n23:08.820 --> 23:10.060\n And I had to.\n\n23:10.060 --> 23:11.900\n And when that happened,\n\n23:11.900 --> 23:14.900\n I felt an incredible responsibility again,\n\n23:14.900 --> 23:17.220\n to go deep, right?\n\n23:17.220 --> 23:19.180\n To go deep with that family,\n\n23:19.180 --> 23:21.980\n to tell the story of this hospital\n\n23:22.980 --> 23:27.380\n with every sort of ounce of focus and talent\n\n23:27.380 --> 23:28.740\n that I could bring to the story.\n\n23:28.740 --> 23:31.260\n Because people should know\n\n23:31.260 --> 23:34.980\n that children are dying of starvation right now\n\n23:34.980 --> 23:36.100\n as we sit here.\n\n23:36.100 --> 23:37.940\n And that that doesn't have to happen.\n\n23:37.940 --> 23:40.300\n And it is happening because of political dynamics\n\n23:40.300 --> 23:41.500\n that we can intervene on.\n\n23:42.660 --> 23:45.700\n Is there times you wanted to walk away,\n\n23:46.780 --> 23:48.620\n quit the telling of the story,\n\n23:51.220 --> 23:53.580\n come back to the United States\n\n23:54.700 --> 23:59.100\n where you can just appreciate\n\n24:02.380 --> 24:04.260\n the wonderful comfort you can have\n\n24:04.260 --> 24:06.180\n just sitting there and having food\n\n24:06.180 --> 24:11.180\n and freedom to do whatever you want,\n\n24:12.500 --> 24:13.860\n those kinds of things.\n\n24:13.860 --> 24:15.620\n Doesn't have to be in the United States.\n\n24:15.620 --> 24:17.580\n In a lot of places in the world.\n\n24:17.580 --> 24:21.340\n Well, that dynamic of sort of like survivor's guilt\n\n24:21.340 --> 24:23.860\n on some level definitely exists.\n\n24:23.860 --> 24:26.220\n One of the hardest things from Hunger Report actually\n\n24:26.220 --> 24:28.940\n was eating, right?\n\n24:28.940 --> 24:31.240\n Because we were in these malnutrition clinics,\n\n24:31.240 --> 24:34.380\n they're called TFCs, Therapeutic Feeding Centers,\n\n24:34.380 --> 24:39.380\n where over a long period of time,\n\n24:41.220 --> 24:45.340\n children lost the ability to eat normal food, right?\n\n24:45.340 --> 24:49.580\n And couldn't digest it and just were literally starving.\n\n24:49.580 --> 24:53.220\n And the practitioners were trying to bring them back\n\n24:53.220 --> 24:55.740\n to a state of thriving.\n\n24:55.740 --> 24:58.100\n But to leave those clinics, right?\n\n24:58.100 --> 25:00.860\n And to go to our camp or to go to our hotel\n\n25:00.860 --> 25:03.380\n and then to have access to food, right?\n\n25:03.380 --> 25:06.700\n Because we could buy food on the streets and in the hotels.\n\n25:08.340 --> 25:10.900\n I mean, it was a very intentional act\n\n25:10.900 --> 25:12.300\n throughout the course of the shoot\n\n25:12.300 --> 25:14.780\n to look at a piece of bread, right?\n\n25:14.780 --> 25:19.340\n Or to look at a bowl of rice and think about that child\n\n25:19.340 --> 25:22.940\n in the TFC and think about how the privilege\n\n25:22.940 --> 25:26.540\n of having that bowl of rice that I could eat and digest.\n\n25:26.540 --> 25:31.540\n So it certainly every day helped me appreciate, right?\n\n25:31.540 --> 25:33.340\n The privilege I had.\n\n25:33.340 --> 25:34.580\n Every bite you take.\n\n25:34.580 --> 25:36.780\n With every bite, absolutely.\n\n25:36.780 --> 25:38.780\n And so I wouldn't call it guilt.\n\n25:38.780 --> 25:39.860\n It wasn't exactly guilt,\n\n25:39.860 --> 25:42.780\n but it was definitely mindfulness, right?\n\n25:42.780 --> 25:47.460\n Meditate on the suffering of people who can't.\n\n25:47.460 --> 25:48.780\n That's right, exactly.\n\n25:48.780 --> 25:52.300\n So that knowledge sort of, it was catalytic in some ways.\n\n25:52.300 --> 25:55.100\n It sort of moved us forward really wanting\n\n25:55.100 --> 25:58.260\n to shape the most powerful story we could\n\n25:58.260 --> 26:00.940\n because we were surrounded by so much suffering.\n\n26:00.940 --> 26:03.180\n So much suffering every day.\n\n26:03.180 --> 26:06.580\n How did filming that movie change you as a man?\n\n26:07.900 --> 26:09.580\n As a human being?\n\n26:09.580 --> 26:12.340\n You've filmed a few difficult documentaries.\n\n26:14.220 --> 26:16.740\n That one is a heavy one.\n\n26:16.740 --> 26:20.100\n When you think of the person you were before you filmed it,\n\n26:20.100 --> 26:21.660\n and now when you wake up every morning\n\n26:21.660 --> 26:23.260\n and look yourself in the mirror,\n\n26:23.260 --> 26:25.380\n how is that person different?\n\n26:25.380 --> 26:29.500\n Every documentary I do changes me in a different way.\n\n26:29.500 --> 26:32.820\n Like I am not static in that sense, right?\n\n26:32.820 --> 26:36.220\n And preformed, it's like I change with every project\n\n26:36.220 --> 26:40.580\n because so many of them are difficult and challenging, right?\n\n26:40.580 --> 26:43.180\n And so in order to do them,\n\n26:43.180 --> 26:46.420\n I have to allow myself to change and be changed by them.\n\n26:46.420 --> 26:48.020\n In the case of Hunger Ward,\n\n26:48.020 --> 26:52.020\n you may remember the girl Omeima,\n\n26:52.020 --> 26:56.740\n who's the 10 year old girl who we showcase in Auden\n\n26:56.740 --> 26:58.660\n in the south of the country.\n\n26:58.660 --> 27:03.660\n And we were there when she was admitted to the hospital.\n\n27:04.740 --> 27:08.340\n And when she was admitted,\n\n27:08.340 --> 27:10.900\n this 10 year old girl weighed 24 pounds\n\n27:10.900 --> 27:14.060\n and she could barely stand up.\n\n27:14.060 --> 27:18.020\n And we started with the permission of the family\n\n27:18.020 --> 27:21.620\n to start to document her treatment\n\n27:21.620 --> 27:25.020\n and to see what would happen with this young girl\n\n27:25.020 --> 27:27.580\n who is so severely malnourished.\n\n27:27.580 --> 27:31.460\n And we watched her be treated by the nurses\n\n27:31.460 --> 27:35.020\n and the doctors in Sadaka Hospital.\n\n27:35.020 --> 27:38.740\n And slowly over the course of a couple of weeks,\n\n27:38.740 --> 27:40.660\n we saw her change.\n\n27:40.660 --> 27:44.060\n We saw her start to sort of gain strength\n\n27:44.060 --> 27:45.780\n and start to recover.\n\n27:45.780 --> 27:50.740\n And she also watched the caregivers very carefully.\n\n27:50.740 --> 27:54.180\n And I watched her watch them.\n\n27:54.180 --> 27:58.540\n And I'll never forget there was a moment\n\n27:58.540 --> 28:02.780\n where about two and a half weeks, I think,\n\n28:02.780 --> 28:05.820\n into her treatment, we walked into a room\n\n28:05.820 --> 28:10.100\n and I saw her offering a cap full of water\n\n28:10.100 --> 28:15.100\n to another younger child who was also starving.\n\n28:15.460 --> 28:17.420\n The shot's actually in the film.\n\n28:17.420 --> 28:22.420\n And so to see Omeima, this child who's starving,\n\n28:22.420 --> 28:27.100\n giving sustenance to a younger, more vulnerable child\n\n28:27.100 --> 28:30.620\n who is also starving, moved me deeply.\n\n28:31.940 --> 28:36.940\n So I saw her learn from the caregivers around her.\n\n28:38.420 --> 28:40.820\n And as a human being, as a filmmaker,\n\n28:40.820 --> 28:44.180\n I was incredibly inspired by Omeima.\n\n28:44.180 --> 28:46.460\n That capacity for compassion is there.\n\n28:46.460 --> 28:49.420\n Even within a 10 year old girl who's starving.\n\n28:49.420 --> 28:52.340\n And so you asked what changed me.\n\n28:52.340 --> 28:54.340\n That's one moment, right?\n\n28:54.340 --> 28:57.060\n Rather than being crushed by such heavy content,\n\n28:57.060 --> 28:58.620\n it was actually the opposite,\n\n28:58.620 --> 29:02.300\n where I came away inspired by a 10 year old girl.\n\n29:02.300 --> 29:05.180\n And I didn't anticipate that.\n\n29:05.180 --> 29:07.340\n I didn't think that's what this content would do,\n\n29:07.340 --> 29:08.540\n but it's what it did.\n\n29:08.540 --> 29:13.020\n It reinforced for me sort of this incredible capacity\n\n29:13.020 --> 29:16.100\n we all have as human beings, right?\n\n29:16.100 --> 29:17.860\n To do good, right?\n\n29:17.860 --> 29:20.820\n To even within the most difficult circumstances,\n\n29:20.820 --> 29:24.940\n to choose who we become and what we do.\n\n29:24.940 --> 29:27.300\n And a 10 year old girl taught me that\n\n29:27.300 --> 29:29.140\n or reinforced that for me.\n\n29:29.140 --> 29:34.140\n Were you able to feel the culture of the people,\n\n29:34.140 --> 29:37.340\n so the language barrier,\n\n29:37.340 --> 29:39.180\n were you able to break through the language barrier,\n\n29:39.180 --> 29:42.340\n the culture barrier, to understand the people?\n\n29:45.100 --> 29:48.940\n Because even suffering has a language of sorts,\n\n29:48.940 --> 29:50.580\n depending on where you are.\n\n29:50.580 --> 29:52.740\n The way people joke about things,\n\n29:52.740 --> 29:55.740\n the way they cry, the way.\n\n29:55.740 --> 29:57.540\n This is an interesting thing I actually wanna ask you.\n\n29:57.540 --> 29:59.540\n Sorry, I'm asking a million questions.\n\n30:00.740 --> 30:02.660\n I find that the people,\n\n30:02.660 --> 30:05.980\n I've been talking to people in Ukraine and Russia,\n\n30:05.980 --> 30:09.420\n but in general, I've gotten a chance to talk to people\n\n30:09.420 --> 30:12.060\n who've been through trauma in their life.\n\n30:13.020 --> 30:18.020\n And there's a humor they have about trauma\n\n30:18.020 --> 30:20.140\n in hard times.\n\n30:20.140 --> 30:22.860\n It depends on the culture, of course.\n\n30:22.860 --> 30:25.460\n Certainly, Russian speaking folk,\n\n30:25.460 --> 30:29.300\n I mean, the more suffering you've experienced,\n\n30:29.300 --> 30:31.660\n for some reason, the more they joke about it.\n\n30:31.660 --> 30:35.020\n It's almost like they're able to see something deep\n\n30:35.020 --> 30:38.580\n about humanity now that they have suffered\n\n30:38.580 --> 30:40.500\n and they're able to laugh at the absurdity,\n\n30:40.500 --> 30:42.260\n the injustice of it all.\n\n30:42.260 --> 30:45.780\n And you could also say it's a way for them to deal with it.\n\n30:45.780 --> 30:50.780\n But that humor has a kind of profound understanding\n\n30:53.260 --> 30:57.260\n within it about what it means to be human.\n\n30:57.260 --> 31:00.420\n That I just, and then you, to really understand it,\n\n31:00.420 --> 31:02.060\n you have to know the language.\n\n31:02.060 --> 31:06.260\n So I guess I'm asking, were you able to really feel\n\n31:07.300 --> 31:09.740\n the humans on the other side of the language?\n\n31:09.740 --> 31:10.980\n I'd like to think so.\n\n31:10.980 --> 31:14.340\n I mean, as you noted, there are universities\n\n31:14.340 --> 31:19.340\n and there are universals in life that transcend language.\n\n31:19.540 --> 31:21.940\n I mean, suffering is suffering.\n\n31:21.940 --> 31:23.300\n Love is love.\n\n31:23.300 --> 31:28.500\n Compassion doesn't take place only through language.\n\n31:28.500 --> 31:29.460\n It's through actions.\n\n31:29.460 --> 31:31.620\n And so was there a language barrier?\n\n31:31.620 --> 31:33.300\n Absolutely.\n\n31:33.300 --> 31:36.980\n Did we try to bridge that through other means\n\n31:36.980 --> 31:41.300\n and sort of universal emotions and experiences?\n\n31:41.300 --> 31:42.140\n Absolutely.\n\n31:42.140 --> 31:44.100\n That's one of the things I always think about\n\n31:44.100 --> 31:48.140\n when I'm filming is how do we distill down to universals\n\n31:49.780 --> 31:54.620\n through imagery, through the vocabulary of cinema?\n\n31:54.620 --> 31:56.420\n Because I believe so deeply that\n\n31:56.420 --> 31:58.540\n that vocabulary should be visual.\n\n31:58.540 --> 32:01.340\n So the words, what's the most powerful way\n\n32:01.340 --> 32:03.260\n to express the universal?\n\n32:03.260 --> 32:07.900\n Is it visual or is it language words?\n\n32:07.900 --> 32:09.860\n I think it's visual.\n\n32:09.860 --> 32:11.660\n And we're talking about the human face\n\n32:11.660 --> 32:14.300\n or human face, human body, everything.\n\n32:14.300 --> 32:15.540\n Through actions as well.\n\n32:15.540 --> 32:16.900\n Actions, the dynamic.\n\n32:16.900 --> 32:20.100\n I'm thinking about a woman named Salha in the film\n\n32:20.100 --> 32:25.100\n who isn't named, but you see her multiple times\n\n32:25.380 --> 32:26.220\n throughout the film.\n\n32:26.220 --> 32:29.420\n And she's basically the matron of the ward in the South.\n\n32:29.420 --> 32:31.580\n And she's the gatekeeper for the ward.\n\n32:31.580 --> 32:33.980\n So no one enters that ward without her permission.\n\n32:33.980 --> 32:36.020\n She's literally the gatekeeper at the door.\n\n32:36.020 --> 32:40.020\n So no one comes in unless Salha allows them to come in.\n\n32:40.020 --> 32:42.140\n But then she also is sort of like\n\n32:43.540 --> 32:47.900\n the first point of contact for compassion in the ward.\n\n32:47.900 --> 32:51.540\n So when mothers and families are admitted,\n\n32:51.540 --> 32:55.540\n she forms relationships between the moms\n\n32:55.540 --> 32:57.540\n and the grandmothers, for example,\n\n32:57.540 --> 33:00.180\n who are admitted and who are living there on the ward.\n\n33:00.180 --> 33:03.620\n And she does it through hugging, right?\n\n33:03.620 --> 33:07.340\n She does it through bringing them food, right?\n\n33:07.340 --> 33:11.060\n And she forms these really rather quickly\n\n33:11.060 --> 33:15.660\n deep relationships of compassion with the families.\n\n33:15.660 --> 33:19.100\n And so it's amazing to watch\n\n33:19.100 --> 33:22.980\n and no language is needed, right, to bear witness to this.\n\n33:22.980 --> 33:26.980\n And she also suffers because of that, right?\n\n33:26.980 --> 33:30.260\n And so near the end of the film, if you recall,\n\n33:31.460 --> 33:35.860\n when another child dies and the mother is wailing,\n\n33:35.860 --> 33:38.980\n we actually cut away to Salha, who's in the hallway,\n\n33:38.980 --> 33:43.020\n who walks into another room and begins sobbing.\n\n33:43.020 --> 33:44.820\n She's not a family member,\n\n33:44.820 --> 33:48.380\n but she has a deep relationship with that family\n\n33:48.380 --> 33:51.420\n that she forged as soon as they stepped into the ward.\n\n33:51.420 --> 33:53.380\n So that's universal, right?\n\n33:53.380 --> 33:58.380\n To see a woman weep because a child has died,\n\n33:58.580 --> 34:00.500\n even if they're not related to that,\n\n34:00.500 --> 34:03.500\n that's a universal sort of emotional experience\n\n34:03.500 --> 34:04.580\n we can all relate to.\n\n34:04.580 --> 34:07.500\n So that's what I mean by visual vocabulary.\n\n34:07.500 --> 34:08.860\n And it's especially powerful\n\n34:08.860 --> 34:12.380\n because she has seen much of this kind of suffering\n\n34:12.380 --> 34:17.020\n and she's still, maybe she has built up some callous\n\n34:17.020 --> 34:20.020\n to be able to work day to day,\n\n34:20.020 --> 34:25.020\n but there's still an ocean underneath the ice.\n\n34:25.060 --> 34:26.700\n She's kept her heart open\n\n34:26.700 --> 34:30.060\n despite all the pain that she sees and feels every day.\n\n34:30.060 --> 34:33.020\n Somehow she's a human being who's able to do that,\n\n34:33.020 --> 34:35.420\n which is a very difficult thing to do, right?\n\n34:35.420 --> 34:38.100\n She still allows herself to be vulnerable.\n\n34:39.180 --> 34:41.500\n And maybe that's why she can do what she does.\n\n34:43.300 --> 34:45.980\n What lessons do you draw from other families in history?\n\n34:45.980 --> 34:50.540\n So for me personally, one that's touched my family\n\n34:50.540 --> 34:54.140\n and one of the great families in history is in Ukraine,\n\n34:54.140 --> 34:56.260\n Holodomor in the 30s.\n\n34:56.260 --> 34:57.540\n 32, 33, right?\n\n34:57.540 --> 34:59.820\n 32, 33 with Stalin.\n\n34:59.820 --> 35:03.060\n Maybe you could speak to the universals of the suffering here.\n\n35:05.220 --> 35:09.820\n What lessons do you draw from those other famines\n\n35:09.820 --> 35:13.220\n if you looked at them or in general about famine\n\n35:13.220 --> 35:17.220\n that are manufactured by the decisions of,\n\n35:17.220 --> 35:19.260\n let's say, authoritarian leaders?\n\n35:19.260 --> 35:24.260\n Well, famine doesn't have to exist\n\n35:29.700 --> 35:31.820\n or the bulk of famines on this planet,\n\n35:31.820 --> 35:33.180\n I believe don't have to exist.\n\n35:33.180 --> 35:36.500\n And most of them, or at least a good number of them\n\n35:36.500 --> 35:39.060\n are manufactured by the leaders\n\n35:40.140 --> 35:44.060\n that choose to use famine as a weapon, right?\n\n35:44.060 --> 35:49.060\n And Ukraine is one of the obvious examples right now,\n\n35:49.740 --> 35:51.540\n with siege tactics that are happening\n\n35:51.540 --> 35:53.460\n in different parts of the country.\n\n35:53.460 --> 35:58.460\n And we built international humanitarian law for a reason,\n\n36:01.980 --> 36:06.500\n many years ago, and it continues to be written to this day.\n\n36:06.500 --> 36:09.500\n And it's there to prevent\n\n36:09.500 --> 36:11.500\n what's happening in Ukraine right now.\n\n36:11.500 --> 36:14.900\n It's there to prevent what's been happening in Yemen\n\n36:14.900 --> 36:16.340\n for seven years.\n\n36:16.340 --> 36:19.820\n And yet there hasn't been any teeth behind it.\n\n36:19.820 --> 36:24.820\n And that's what disturbs me is that we can see\n\n36:25.420 --> 36:30.340\n how these famines are being used as weapons in war.\n\n36:30.340 --> 36:34.020\n And yet we aren't sort of using the levers of power\n\n36:34.020 --> 36:39.020\n that exist in order to, I think, to call out\n\n36:39.020 --> 36:43.500\n in important and powerful ways those who are causing them\n\n36:43.500 --> 36:46.300\n and to make sure that we hold them accountable\n\n36:46.300 --> 36:47.140\n on the global stage.\n\n36:47.140 --> 36:51.300\n Now, to some extent, that seems to be happening in Ukraine\n\n36:51.300 --> 36:53.860\n in a way that hasn't happened for a long time.\n\n36:53.860 --> 36:56.420\n And that gives me hope, right?\n\n36:56.420 --> 36:58.900\n And yet I don't believe we've done enough.\n\n36:59.860 --> 37:02.620\n And I think the national community needs to do far more\n\n37:02.620 --> 37:05.860\n than we are both in Yemen, in Ethiopia,\n\n37:05.860 --> 37:07.500\n and in Ukraine right now.\n\n37:07.500 --> 37:10.500\n There are certain kinds of things that captivate\n\n37:10.500 --> 37:14.140\n the global attention, and it seems like starvation\n\n37:14.140 --> 37:15.460\n is not always one of them.\n\n37:16.700 --> 37:20.140\n For some reason, murder and destruction\n\n37:21.260 --> 37:23.620\n gets people's attention more.\n\n37:23.620 --> 37:26.980\n The death, of course, is easy to enumerate,\n\n37:26.980 --> 37:29.060\n but it's the suffering that's the problem.\n\n37:29.060 --> 37:32.820\n Yeah, yeah, you know, when we went to film Hunger Ward,\n\n37:32.820 --> 37:35.100\n that was one of the creative questions\n\n37:35.100 --> 37:38.900\n that I was really concerned about because starvation,\n\n37:38.900 --> 37:41.780\n you know, it's not a quick action, right?\n\n37:41.780 --> 37:45.780\n It's a long, slow, insidious process, right?\n\n37:45.780 --> 37:47.860\n Just like hunger, right?\n\n37:47.860 --> 37:52.860\n And yet when you're hungry, right, it takes you over.\n\n37:53.700 --> 37:56.420\n It becomes the most important thing, right?\n\n37:56.420 --> 37:59.060\n It's just absolutely fundamental to life.\n\n37:59.060 --> 38:00.860\n It's like drawing breath.\n\n38:00.860 --> 38:05.300\n And so I really, before I filmed Hunger Ward,\n\n38:05.300 --> 38:07.860\n I struggled to sort of answer\n\n38:07.860 --> 38:09.900\n how we could creatively approach that\n\n38:09.900 --> 38:13.460\n because, you know, someone's sitting in a clinic, right?\n\n38:13.460 --> 38:16.780\n Starving or being treated for starvation, you know,\n\n38:16.780 --> 38:19.100\n that's a pretty static scene, right?\n\n38:20.420 --> 38:24.380\n And what we found was that because of the volume of cases\n\n38:24.380 --> 38:28.380\n and because of the nature of sort of how quickly\n\n38:28.380 --> 38:32.060\n how quickly people were coming and going\n\n38:32.060 --> 38:34.500\n is that it was more dynamic than we anticipated.\n\n38:35.820 --> 38:38.820\n And there's something also about starvation.\n\n38:38.820 --> 38:40.260\n You get tired.\n\n38:40.260 --> 38:43.460\n It's almost like it's a quiet suffering.\n\n38:43.460 --> 38:44.300\n Yeah.\n\n38:46.100 --> 38:48.100\n And by the way, there's something about\n\n38:48.100 --> 38:49.980\n when I think about dark times,\n\n38:49.980 --> 38:53.140\n I mean, you'll hear me chuckle, for example.\n\n38:53.140 --> 38:54.420\n I don't know what that is.\n\n38:54.420 --> 38:59.420\n That's almost like, it's almost like\n\n38:59.460 --> 39:02.220\n you have to kind of laugh at,\n\n39:03.660 --> 39:07.660\n you can't help but laugh at like the injustice\n\n39:07.660 --> 39:08.780\n and the cruelty in the world.\n\n39:08.780 --> 39:10.780\n Somehow that helps your mind deal with it.\n\n39:10.780 --> 39:13.180\n I mean, I see this all the time.\n\n39:13.180 --> 39:16.380\n Like when you're struggling, you can't feed your family.\n\n39:16.380 --> 39:17.660\n You lost your home.\n\n39:18.620 --> 39:21.620\n The last thing you have is jokes about.\n\n39:21.620 --> 39:22.460\n It's humor.\n\n39:22.460 --> 39:23.300\n Yeah, it's humor.\n\n39:23.300 --> 39:28.180\n It's like, ah, the fucking man fucked me over again.\n\n39:28.180 --> 39:30.460\n And there's jokes all around that.\n\n39:30.460 --> 39:35.460\n And then you laugh and you drink vodka and you play music.\n\n39:36.020 --> 39:37.260\n I don't know what that is.\n\n39:37.260 --> 39:38.260\n I don't know what that is.\n\n39:38.260 --> 39:39.540\n It's gallows humor, right?\n\n39:39.540 --> 39:44.340\n It's a way of, I think, simultaneously acknowledging\n\n39:44.340 --> 39:46.780\n and allowing yourself to move forward, right?\n\n39:46.780 --> 39:49.820\n Beyond the pain and the suffering.\n\n39:49.820 --> 39:52.780\n So you mentioned Ukraine and you mentioned Putin.\n\n39:52.780 --> 39:57.780\n What are your thoughts about the humanitarian crisis\n\n39:58.340 --> 40:00.700\n and generally the suffering that's resulting\n\n40:00.700 --> 40:02.420\n from the war in Ukraine?\n\n40:02.420 --> 40:03.980\n Well, first off, I think the conflict\n\n40:03.980 --> 40:06.260\n is just gonna exacerbate, you know,\n\n40:06.260 --> 40:11.260\n sort of the global challenge we have with displacement.\n\n40:12.940 --> 40:17.540\n The last entire trilogy I did was about displacement\n\n40:17.540 --> 40:19.540\n to great extent due to war.\n\n40:19.540 --> 40:23.060\n And, you know, this is a huge displacement of human beings\n\n40:23.060 --> 40:24.740\n regardless of the cause.\n\n40:24.740 --> 40:29.220\n And that is gonna sort of have a ripple effect\n\n40:29.220 --> 40:31.980\n across the globe for many, many years to come\n\n40:31.980 --> 40:34.940\n regardless of even if the conflict ended today.\n\n40:34.940 --> 40:35.780\n So there's that.\n\n40:35.780 --> 40:38.020\n That's gonna set up a whole nother strain\n\n40:38.020 --> 40:42.540\n on sort of the global sort of resources\n\n40:44.020 --> 40:47.740\n that come into play to deal with refugees.\n\n40:47.740 --> 40:50.820\n You know, there were 79 million displaced people\n\n40:50.820 --> 40:54.780\n on this globe prior to the Ukrainian conflict, right?\n\n40:54.780 --> 40:56.580\n You probably know the numbers better than I do\n\n40:56.580 --> 40:59.340\n in terms of what the current estimates are\n\n40:59.340 --> 41:00.820\n for displacement from Ukraine.\n\n41:00.820 --> 41:01.940\n It's four to six million.\n\n41:01.940 --> 41:03.220\n So what are we up to now?\n\n41:03.220 --> 41:07.100\n 73, 74 million individuals on this planet now\n\n41:07.100 --> 41:09.260\n who are displaced?\n\n41:09.260 --> 41:10.860\n That's a significant bump.\n\n41:12.060 --> 41:16.220\n I wish that the levers of power were used differently\n\n41:16.220 --> 41:19.620\n in situations like Ukraine and Syria, for example.\n\n41:20.740 --> 41:23.380\n So what are the levers of power?\n\n41:23.380 --> 41:24.500\n Well, military might.\n\n41:24.500 --> 41:26.740\n Let's take that for one, right?\n\n41:26.740 --> 41:31.740\n So I have always felt after working in Syria and Turkey\n\n41:34.700 --> 41:39.460\n that we completely missed our opportunity\n\n41:39.460 --> 41:44.380\n as a player on the global stage with military capability\n\n41:44.380 --> 41:48.700\n to prevent the killing of hundreds of thousands\n\n41:48.700 --> 41:50.860\n of civilians in Syria.\n\n41:50.860 --> 41:54.660\n We had the ability and we didn't leverage that ability.\n\n41:54.660 --> 41:59.660\n You know, the fact that I talked with so many Syrians\n\n41:59.740 --> 42:02.020\n during the course of doing that project\n\n42:02.020 --> 42:07.020\n who told me their stories of living in their house, right?\n\n42:07.540 --> 42:12.460\n And having a Syrian helicopter fly over their house\n\n42:12.460 --> 42:16.260\n and drop a 55 gallon drum full of explosives\n\n42:16.260 --> 42:20.700\n and shrapnel in their neighborhood\n\n42:20.700 --> 42:24.060\n over and over and over again.\n\n42:24.060 --> 42:27.580\n Not focused on any military targets,\n\n42:27.580 --> 42:31.500\n only meant to kill and sow fear, right?\n\n42:31.500 --> 42:35.540\n And early in the conflict, we could have stopped that.\n\n42:35.540 --> 42:39.020\n Before Russia got involved, we could have intervened\n\n42:39.020 --> 42:40.820\n and created a no fly zone.\n\n42:40.820 --> 42:43.780\n That we, the United States or coalition\n\n42:43.780 --> 42:45.340\n that we were a part of, yeah.\n\n42:45.340 --> 42:47.380\n And we didn't do it and we could have.\n\n42:47.380 --> 42:49.500\n And I think that's an example where we have\n\n42:49.500 --> 42:52.180\n the military capability to actually do good\n\n42:52.180 --> 42:53.420\n in a situation like that.\n\n42:53.420 --> 42:55.700\n And we don't usually use it for those purposes.\n\n42:55.700 --> 42:58.660\n And I think that's what a military ought to be used for\n\n42:58.660 --> 43:02.620\n beyond just defending our borders is to save others\n\n43:02.620 --> 43:04.860\n with the privilege that that power affords.\n\n43:04.860 --> 43:07.460\n What do you think about the power of the military\n\n43:07.460 --> 43:09.180\n versus the power of sanctions\n\n43:09.180 --> 43:11.220\n versus the power of conversation?\n\n43:12.500 --> 43:13.940\n They're all different tools, right?\n\n43:13.940 --> 43:15.460\n To be used at different moments.\n\n43:15.460 --> 43:20.460\n But if words fail, if sanctions fail, right?\n\n43:21.340 --> 43:24.100\n I think there are moments in history\n\n43:24.100 --> 43:26.340\n where power is justified, right?\n\n43:26.340 --> 43:28.140\n And I think Syria was one of them.\n\n43:28.140 --> 43:31.900\n I think when barrel bombs were dropping\n\n43:31.900 --> 43:34.700\n on civilian neighborhoods for months and months and months\n\n43:34.700 --> 43:37.380\n with no intent to do anything\n\n43:37.380 --> 43:40.060\n other than kill Syrian civilians,\n\n43:40.060 --> 43:43.540\n that's an instance I think where might is justified\n\n43:43.540 --> 43:45.340\n to shoot those helicopters out of the sky.\n\n43:45.340 --> 43:46.660\n Here's the difficult thing.\n\n43:46.660 --> 43:48.460\n We've talked about Yemen.\n\n43:48.460 --> 43:53.100\n Where's the line between good and evil\n\n43:53.100 --> 43:56.820\n for US intervention in different countries\n\n43:56.820 --> 43:58.540\n and conflicts in the world?\n\n43:59.660 --> 44:02.300\n It's easy to look back 10, 20, 30 years\n\n44:02.300 --> 44:05.740\n to know what was and wasn't a quote unquote just war.\n\n44:05.740 --> 44:08.740\n In the moment, how do we know?\n\n44:08.740 --> 44:11.620\n I think it's incredibly difficult to answer that, right?\n\n44:11.620 --> 44:14.980\n And I think that's why leaders make the wrong choices\n\n44:14.980 --> 44:15.820\n so often, right?\n\n44:15.820 --> 44:17.580\n Is they second guess themselves.\n\n44:18.980 --> 44:21.580\n I think you take all the data at your fingertips,\n\n44:21.580 --> 44:23.580\n all the intelligence that you have, right?\n\n44:23.580 --> 44:25.940\n And you look at it all very carefully\n\n44:25.940 --> 44:27.980\n and you make a decision, right?\n\n44:27.980 --> 44:30.420\n There are some instances though\n\n44:30.420 --> 44:33.980\n where it's very clear what's happening, right?\n\n44:33.980 --> 44:36.380\n And leaders still don't act, right?\n\n44:36.380 --> 44:38.660\n In Yemen right now, for example,\n\n44:38.660 --> 44:40.900\n it's very clear what's happening, right?\n\n44:40.900 --> 44:44.420\n Children are being starved because of a blockade.\n\n44:44.420 --> 44:48.340\n All the US would have to do is ensure that blockade,\n\n44:48.340 --> 44:50.340\n now there's a two month ceasefire in place now,\n\n44:50.340 --> 44:54.020\n but remains lifted beyond the ceasefire\n\n44:54.020 --> 44:56.300\n and children will stop starving.\n\n44:56.300 --> 44:57.860\n That's pretty simple.\n\n44:57.860 --> 45:00.660\n You can trace, it's a direct connection.\n\n45:00.660 --> 45:04.940\n And we haven't had the sort of the moral wherewithal\n\n45:04.940 --> 45:08.020\n to make that decision because we're too interested\n\n45:08.020 --> 45:10.900\n in maintaining positive ties with Saudi Arabia\n\n45:10.900 --> 45:14.340\n where oil flows from and so much influence\n\n45:15.980 --> 45:17.660\n because Saudi Arabia has so much influence\n\n45:17.660 --> 45:19.900\n throughout the MENA region.\n\n45:19.900 --> 45:22.140\n We want to keep that relationship tight\n\n45:22.140 --> 45:26.300\n despite sort of the moral wounds that come from that.\n\n45:26.300 --> 45:30.580\n About half the world is under authoritarian regimes\n\n45:30.580 --> 45:33.420\n and everybody operates under narratives.\n\n45:33.420 --> 45:35.820\n And there's a narrative in the United States\n\n45:35.820 --> 45:38.900\n that freedom is good, democracy is good.\n\n45:40.180 --> 45:43.540\n I have fallen victim to this narrative.\n\n45:43.540 --> 45:44.700\n I believe in it.\n\n45:46.020 --> 45:48.500\n I'm saying this jokingly, but not really\n\n45:49.620 --> 45:53.700\n because who knows the truth of anything in this world?\n\n45:53.700 --> 45:57.020\n I eat meat, factory farm meat,\n\n45:57.020 --> 45:59.740\n and I seem to not be intellectually\n\n45:59.740 --> 46:02.580\n and philosophically tortured by this, and I should be.\n\n46:02.580 --> 46:04.980\n There's a lot of suffering there.\n\n46:04.980 --> 46:09.300\n What do we do to lessen the suffering\n\n46:09.300 --> 46:11.540\n of the people under authoritarian regimes?\n\n46:12.620 --> 46:14.660\n Again, the same question.\n\n46:14.660 --> 46:19.660\n Military conflict, diplomacy, sanctions,\n\n46:20.340 --> 46:21.700\n all those kinds of things.\n\n46:24.340 --> 46:28.580\n Does that lessen suffering or increase the suffering\n\n46:28.580 --> 46:30.260\n for what you see in Yemen?\n\n46:31.780 --> 46:36.300\n Is it something that has to be healed across generations\n\n46:36.300 --> 46:39.260\n or can be healed on a scale of months and years?\n\n46:39.260 --> 46:42.140\n I'm just a guy with a camera, Alex, you know?\n\n46:42.140 --> 46:43.540\n But as a guy with a camera,\n\n46:44.580 --> 46:49.460\n I've seen a lot of things in a lot of places\n\n46:49.460 --> 46:54.380\n and I've seen the effects these decisions made\n\n46:54.380 --> 46:59.300\n by authoritarian leaders have on their own citizens.\n\n46:59.300 --> 47:02.540\n And that's what drives my thinking on this.\n\n47:04.500 --> 47:08.380\n And that's what drives and motivates me each day\n\n47:08.380 --> 47:11.260\n to raise the red flag through my films\n\n47:11.260 --> 47:14.580\n and say, listen, Biden,\n\n47:15.940 --> 47:20.940\n you campaigned for president in part on a platform\n\n47:20.940 --> 47:25.940\n that said that we would regain our prominence\n\n47:25.980 --> 47:28.300\n on the moral stage of the world\n\n47:28.300 --> 47:33.300\n and that we would prioritize sort of a moral paradigm\n\n47:35.420 --> 47:39.300\n over relationships with authoritarian regimes,\n\n47:39.300 --> 47:41.500\n Saudi Arabia being one.\n\n47:41.500 --> 47:44.780\n And yet when the CIA report came out\n\n47:44.780 --> 47:47.780\n that clearly articulated in detail\n\n47:47.780 --> 47:51.300\n that MBS was responsible for Khashoggi's murder\n\n47:51.300 --> 47:53.460\n and for cutting his body into pieces\n\n47:53.460 --> 47:56.580\n and probably burning it in the backyard of the embassy,\n\n47:57.460 --> 47:58.460\n what did Biden do?\n\n47:59.500 --> 48:02.380\n He didn't really make a pariah out of MBS\n\n48:02.380 --> 48:05.180\n like he said he was going to, right?\n\n48:05.180 --> 48:06.860\n What if he'd done something else\n\n48:06.860 --> 48:09.180\n and actually done what he said he was gonna do,\n\n48:09.180 --> 48:10.020\n which was make MBS?\n\n48:10.020 --> 48:13.580\n What if he had removed the ability for MBS\n\n48:13.580 --> 48:16.340\n to fly to the United States, for example?\n\n48:16.340 --> 48:18.060\n Now that's a sanction, right?\n\n48:18.060 --> 48:21.700\n That's a sanction that's individual and concrete\n\n48:21.700 --> 48:25.100\n and would be hugely embarrassing for MBS.\n\n48:25.100 --> 48:27.340\n That would have been Biden saying,\n\n48:27.340 --> 48:31.220\n this is unacceptable behavior, right?\n\n48:31.220 --> 48:35.540\n This is something which because you executed\n\n48:35.540 --> 48:40.060\n such a horrendous act on someone living in the United States,\n\n48:40.060 --> 48:47.060\n we are not going to give you a stage here at least, right?\n\n48:47.060 --> 48:49.180\n Within the borders of our country.\n\n48:49.180 --> 48:51.380\n Those are the things that leaders can do\n\n48:51.380 --> 48:53.300\n that I don't think they do often enough.\n\n48:53.300 --> 48:55.820\n And certainly our leader right now isn't doing it\n\n48:55.820 --> 48:57.260\n in the way I wish he were.\n\n48:57.260 --> 48:59.900\n He certainly has taken a different stand on Ukraine\n\n49:01.740 --> 49:03.100\n and been very vocal.\n\n49:03.100 --> 49:05.420\n But there's so many instances we could talk about\n\n49:05.420 --> 49:09.940\n where I feel like the political game and ship, right?\n\n49:09.940 --> 49:13.420\n Often falls into maintaining relationships\n\n49:13.420 --> 49:15.180\n like with MBS and Saudi Arabia\n\n49:15.180 --> 49:16.820\n rather than doing the right thing.\n\n49:16.820 --> 49:20.940\n Rather than as a nation, a leader of a nation saying,\n\n49:20.940 --> 49:22.420\n this is unacceptable.\n\n49:22.420 --> 49:24.340\n We have a higher standard than this.\n\n49:24.340 --> 49:27.260\n Cause I think when leaders do that,\n\n49:28.620 --> 49:30.580\n it becomes aspirational, right?\n\n49:30.580 --> 49:32.980\n It becomes aspirational for other leaders\n\n49:34.620 --> 49:36.220\n in the progressive world at least.\n\n49:36.220 --> 49:38.620\n And also it rings the alarm bells\n\n49:38.620 --> 49:41.740\n for other authoritarian leaders and says,\n\n49:41.740 --> 49:44.220\n you know what, there are lines, right?\n\n49:44.220 --> 49:46.260\n There are things that can't be done\n\n49:46.260 --> 49:48.140\n or there will be significant consequences.\n\n49:48.140 --> 49:51.500\n Like you will not be able to fly into our airspace anymore.\n\n49:51.500 --> 49:55.180\n And sanctions I think need to be concrete and individual\n\n49:55.180 --> 49:58.060\n to some, in addition to the larger scope.\n\n49:58.060 --> 50:00.380\n But when they're concrete and individual,\n\n50:01.420 --> 50:04.420\n I think often they're felt in a different way.\n\n50:04.420 --> 50:06.860\n You mean felt obviously by the individuals.\n\n50:06.860 --> 50:09.420\n And so the ripple effects of that\n\n50:11.700 --> 50:16.700\n might have the power to steer the direction of nations.\n\n50:18.420 --> 50:21.500\n Because of the nature of authoritarian regimes, right?\n\n50:21.500 --> 50:22.780\n Individuals have so much power.\n\n50:22.780 --> 50:23.620\n Exactly, right.\n\n50:23.620 --> 50:28.620\n So if Putin is put on trial in the Hague at some point,\n\n50:30.300 --> 50:32.140\n or at least there's the threat of that, right?\n\n50:32.140 --> 50:34.380\n Now that's likely never to happen of course\n\n50:34.380 --> 50:37.220\n because someone has to be in custody to go on trial, right?\n\n50:37.220 --> 50:39.300\n And he's never gonna allow that to happen.\n\n50:39.300 --> 50:44.300\n But just knowing that that danger exists\n\n50:45.780 --> 50:49.740\n is going to change his travel plans in the future, right?\n\n50:49.740 --> 50:51.980\n MBS not being able to fly to the US,\n\n50:51.980 --> 50:54.820\n he's gonna feel that and be embarrassed by that.\n\n50:55.940 --> 51:00.860\n So I think they have a special meaning and consequence\n\n51:00.860 --> 51:03.580\n in authoritarian regimes because of that.\n\n51:03.580 --> 51:06.100\n So you said you're just a guy with a camera.\n\n51:06.100 --> 51:06.940\n Yeah.\n\n51:07.780 --> 51:12.780\n I would say you're a brilliant guy with a camera.\n\n51:13.940 --> 51:15.980\n I'm also a kind of guy with a camera.\n\n51:15.980 --> 51:16.980\n You're a guy with a couple cameras.\n\n51:16.980 --> 51:17.820\n A couple cameras.\n\n51:17.820 --> 51:18.660\n I have more.\n\n51:18.660 --> 51:20.340\n A couple mics too.\n\n51:20.340 --> 51:23.180\n You got a couple mics, a couple cameras, robot over here.\n\n51:23.180 --> 51:25.620\n When you can't beat them with quality,\n\n51:25.620 --> 51:27.300\n you bring the quantity.\n\n51:27.300 --> 51:28.500\n That's right.\n\n51:28.500 --> 51:31.740\n So to me, that's also an interest partially\n\n51:31.740 --> 51:36.100\n because I also speak Russian and a bit Ukrainian.\n\n51:37.820 --> 51:39.900\n I wanna study that part of the world.\n\n51:39.900 --> 51:41.620\n I wanna talk to a lot of people.\n\n51:41.620 --> 51:42.860\n I wanna talk to the leaders.\n\n51:42.860 --> 51:44.540\n I wanna talk to regular people.\n\n51:44.540 --> 51:48.700\n To be honest, and I would love to get your comments on this,\n\n51:48.700 --> 51:51.380\n the regular quote unquote people\n\n51:51.380 --> 51:53.420\n are way more fascinating to me.\n\n51:53.420 --> 51:58.340\n As a filmmaker, how do you figure out how to tell this story?\n\n51:58.340 --> 52:00.300\n I'm sure a guy with a camera,\n\n52:00.300 --> 52:02.420\n you're looking at war in Ukraine,\n\n52:02.420 --> 52:05.900\n but also what's going on in Yemen and Syria\n\n52:05.900 --> 52:07.140\n and other places in the world.\n\n52:07.140 --> 52:08.380\n I mentioned North Korea.\n\n52:08.380 --> 52:10.260\n That's a super interesting one.\n\n52:10.260 --> 52:11.740\n Hard to bring cameras along.\n\n52:11.740 --> 52:16.580\n China, in Canada, the truckers.\n\n52:16.580 --> 52:18.460\n There's all kinds of fascinating things\n\n52:18.460 --> 52:19.780\n happening in the world.\n\n52:19.780 --> 52:23.780\n So you as a scholar of human suffering\n\n52:23.780 --> 52:25.020\n and human flourishing,\n\n52:26.300 --> 52:28.300\n how do you choose how to tell the story?\n\n52:29.180 --> 52:30.140\n How do I choose a story?\n\n52:30.140 --> 52:31.220\n How do I choose how to tell a story?\n\n52:31.220 --> 52:34.420\n Both a story and how, I assume those are coupled.\n\n52:35.900 --> 52:38.100\n So how do you choose which story to tell?\n\n52:38.100 --> 52:40.620\n And how do you choose how to tell that story?\n\n52:41.980 --> 52:45.660\n Well, in terms of how to choose which story,\n\n52:48.380 --> 52:51.780\n it's a bit of a mystery potion for me, frankly.\n\n52:52.980 --> 52:55.540\n I go often on instinct,\n\n52:55.540 --> 52:58.860\n but there's also a highly intentional piece of it\n\n52:58.860 --> 53:00.140\n for me as well.\n\n53:00.140 --> 53:02.340\n And the intentional piece is,\n\n53:03.380 --> 53:06.900\n I guess I'd call it the do I care threshold,\n\n53:06.900 --> 53:08.500\n or the so what threshold.\n\n53:08.500 --> 53:11.300\n You personally, just something in your heart\n\n53:11.300 --> 53:15.700\n just kind of gets excited or hurts or just feels something.\n\n53:15.700 --> 53:17.380\n So one of the things that disturbs me\n\n53:17.380 --> 53:19.020\n about American culture, Lex,\n\n53:19.020 --> 53:21.380\n is that we seem to be a people\n\n53:21.380 --> 53:24.180\n that's fascinated by reality television, for example.\n\n53:24.180 --> 53:27.660\n Like look at how many of us here in America\n\n53:27.660 --> 53:30.340\n watch reality television, right?\n\n53:30.340 --> 53:31.620\n That deeply disturbs me.\n\n53:31.620 --> 53:33.340\n Not that I've never watched an episode,\n\n53:33.340 --> 53:36.020\n I've shot a whole season of it once to make a living, right?\n\n53:36.020 --> 53:38.580\n So it's like I know it, right?\n\n53:38.580 --> 53:42.620\n But I feel like the things we should be paying attention to\n\n53:42.620 --> 53:44.780\n are the things, personally,\n\n53:44.780 --> 53:47.860\n are the things I choose to film, right?\n\n53:47.860 --> 53:52.860\n As a human being, as a dad, as a filmmaker,\n\n53:53.540 --> 53:55.900\n I think we should be paying attention\n\n53:55.900 --> 53:58.860\n to the fact that children are being starved in Yemen.\n\n53:58.860 --> 54:00.500\n I think we should be paying attention\n\n54:00.500 --> 54:03.220\n to the fact that Ukrainians are being displaced\n\n54:03.220 --> 54:04.580\n by the millions.\n\n54:04.580 --> 54:07.100\n So there's this so what threshold that I use.\n\n54:07.100 --> 54:09.580\n And I feel like it has to be a topic\n\n54:09.580 --> 54:14.100\n that if we don't cover and we don't put out in the world\n\n54:14.100 --> 54:16.140\n in the largest possible way,\n\n54:16.140 --> 54:17.580\n in the hope of intervening,\n\n54:17.580 --> 54:20.300\n in the hope of marshaling maximum resources\n\n54:20.300 --> 54:22.780\n and attention to solving the problem,\n\n54:22.780 --> 54:25.460\n that's what I'm dedicated to as a filmmaker.\n\n54:25.460 --> 54:29.100\n Because I didn't pick up a camera initially\n\n54:29.100 --> 54:31.820\n to film puppy dogs, right?\n\n54:31.820 --> 54:33.420\n To make people smile.\n\n54:33.420 --> 54:36.460\n I believe the camera is a tool for change.\n\n54:36.460 --> 54:40.140\n I believe the camera is a powerful tool\n\n54:40.140 --> 54:44.220\n that we can use to raise awareness and marshal resources\n\n54:44.220 --> 54:47.660\n and help people understand the impact\n\n54:47.660 --> 54:50.140\n that these geopolitical decisions have\n\n54:50.140 --> 54:51.780\n on real people's lives.\n\n54:51.780 --> 54:56.780\n And that's the intent I create each film with.\n\n54:57.460 --> 54:59.340\n Now, how I choose each story,\n\n54:59.340 --> 55:01.860\n that's the magic potion piece of it, right?\n\n55:01.860 --> 55:04.820\n And often one flows rather organically\n\n55:04.820 --> 55:06.660\n into another, frankly.\n\n55:06.660 --> 55:08.140\n So you just kind of, like you said,\n\n55:08.140 --> 55:09.940\n you go with instinct a little bit.\n\n55:09.940 --> 55:12.900\n To some extent, but oftentimes I choose the next project\n\n55:12.900 --> 55:17.380\n based on relationships I've developed in the last film.\n\n55:17.380 --> 55:18.220\n Right?\n\n55:18.220 --> 55:20.540\n And so one often flows into another\n\n55:20.540 --> 55:21.900\n through relationships I develop.\n\n55:21.900 --> 55:24.540\n And then a colleague will share a detail\n\n55:24.540 --> 55:27.340\n about something that's happening in a certain place.\n\n55:27.340 --> 55:30.860\n And I'll go, hmm, really, I didn't know that, right?\n\n55:30.860 --> 55:33.860\n And usually it's before it's hit the world stage\n\n55:33.860 --> 55:34.900\n in a big way.\n\n55:34.900 --> 55:36.740\n And so I start to do due diligence.\n\n55:36.740 --> 55:39.340\n And often that, it reveals it to be a much bigger\n\n55:39.340 --> 55:43.620\n and more pressing topic that I wanna learn more about.\n\n55:43.620 --> 55:48.620\n Before I talk to you about Syria and Lifeboat,\n\n55:50.020 --> 55:52.860\n you mentioned a camera is the best weapon.\n\n55:52.860 --> 55:57.860\n Maybe just, well, I can't take out a tank, right?\n\n55:57.860 --> 55:58.780\n But it's a good weapon.\n\n55:58.780 --> 56:00.660\n Second, top three.\n\n56:00.660 --> 56:01.500\n Yeah.\n\n56:01.500 --> 56:03.300\n I love the humor throughout this.\n\n56:03.300 --> 56:04.860\n I really appreciate it.\n\n56:04.860 --> 56:07.140\n We were talking about such dark topics.\n\n56:07.140 --> 56:07.980\n Yeah.\n\n56:07.980 --> 56:12.540\n It resets the mind in a way that allows me to think.\n\n56:12.540 --> 56:13.900\n So thank you.\n\n56:13.900 --> 56:18.900\n As a filmmaker, I almost wanna talk\n\n56:20.620 --> 56:23.740\n about the technical details.\n\n56:23.740 --> 56:24.580\n Uh oh.\n\n56:24.580 --> 56:29.020\n How do you choose to shoot stuff?\n\n56:29.020 --> 56:31.700\n Again, so maybe you can explain to me.\n\n56:31.700 --> 56:36.700\n I work with incredible folks that care about lenses\n\n56:37.860 --> 56:40.540\n and equipment and so on.\n\n56:40.540 --> 56:45.540\n And I tend to be somebody that just wants to kinda go\n\n56:50.340 --> 56:55.340\n as like a gorilla shooting, like not plan too much,\n\n56:56.220 --> 56:58.580\n just go with gritty.\n\n56:58.580 --> 57:01.020\n I'm trying to come up with words that sound positive.\n\n57:01.020 --> 57:04.060\n Do a positive spin on what I try to do.\n\n57:04.060 --> 57:08.500\n But like gritty, don't over plan, use,\n\n57:08.500 --> 57:10.780\n like we had a big discussion if you see this light.\n\n57:10.780 --> 57:12.180\n Yeah.\n\n57:12.180 --> 57:15.700\n It's on a stand that's a very ghetto stand.\n\n57:15.700 --> 57:16.540\n Yeah.\n\n57:16.540 --> 57:17.460\n You need a sandbag on that, man.\n\n57:17.460 --> 57:18.300\n Exactly.\n\n57:18.300 --> 57:23.300\n So no sandbag and like the stand is actually bending\n\n57:23.820 --> 57:25.260\n under the weight of that thing.\n\n57:25.260 --> 57:26.380\n It could fall on us.\n\n57:26.380 --> 57:27.220\n It could fall.\n\n57:27.220 --> 57:28.060\n It probably won't reach us, but it could fall.\n\n57:28.060 --> 57:30.940\n But the danger, live under that danger.\n\n57:30.940 --> 57:32.660\n Embrace that danger.\n\n57:32.660 --> 57:33.500\n Love it.\n\n57:33.500 --> 57:34.380\n Yeah.\n\n57:34.380 --> 57:36.500\n Because that thing is easier to transport\n\n57:36.500 --> 57:37.740\n than a heavier one.\n\n57:37.740 --> 57:38.580\n Yeah.\n\n57:38.580 --> 57:40.260\n Sandbag, that's extra weight.\n\n57:40.260 --> 57:42.860\n So if you keep, like people tell me\n\n57:42.860 --> 57:44.660\n there's the right way to do stuff.\n\n57:44.660 --> 57:47.900\n Like here's these giant cases with all the kinds of padding\n\n57:47.900 --> 57:49.260\n for transporting stuff.\n\n57:49.260 --> 57:52.220\n I transport most of the equipment in a garbage bag.\n\n57:52.220 --> 57:53.060\n Yeah.\n\n57:53.060 --> 57:56.220\n So that's just a preference because that's somehow\n\n57:56.220 --> 58:00.660\n that chaos allows me to ignore all the stupidity\n\n58:00.660 --> 58:04.780\n of loving the equipment and focusing on the story.\n\n58:04.780 --> 58:09.780\n So that said, I've never shot anything like worthwhile.\n\n58:11.180 --> 58:15.620\n Like there is power to the visual.\n\n58:15.620 --> 58:16.460\n Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n58:16.460 --> 58:17.820\n Like definitely.\n\n58:17.820 --> 58:22.820\n And so finding a certain angle, a certain light\n\n58:22.940 --> 58:26.300\n whether it's natural light or additional artificial lighting\n\n58:27.260 --> 58:32.260\n just capturing a tear, capturing when the person forgets\n\n58:32.260 --> 58:35.740\n themselves for a moment and looks out into the distance\n\n58:35.740 --> 58:38.460\n missing somebody, thinking about somebody.\n\n58:38.460 --> 58:42.260\n All of those like moments you can capture a lens,\n\n58:42.260 --> 58:44.900\n a camera can do magic with that.\n\n58:44.900 --> 58:46.420\n I don't even know the question I'm asking you\n\n58:46.420 --> 58:51.140\n but how do both technical and philosophical,\n\n58:51.140 --> 58:54.180\n how do you capture the visual power that you're after?\n\n58:54.180 --> 58:55.340\n Yeah.\n\n58:55.340 --> 58:59.820\n So, so many of my films I think are built\n\n58:59.820 --> 59:02.980\n on the premise of access, right?\n\n59:02.980 --> 59:07.980\n Built on this notion that the biggest hurdle\n\n59:10.420 --> 59:14.860\n to the story is getting there, being there in the room\n\n59:14.860 --> 59:19.860\n or being there on the boat while a crisis is unfolding.\n\n59:19.860 --> 59:23.180\n And that access typically is really nuanced\n\n59:23.180 --> 59:26.020\n and difficult to gain.\n\n59:26.020 --> 59:28.940\n And then trust flows from that, right?\n\n59:28.940 --> 59:31.740\n Cause usually it takes a long time to gain that access\n\n59:32.780 --> 59:35.420\n because that access is so hard fought.\n\n59:37.020 --> 59:42.020\n It necessarily informs how we film, right?\n\n59:43.380 --> 59:47.380\n To be in a room at Sadaka Hospital in Southern Yemen\n\n59:47.380 --> 59:50.820\n I can't have five people in that room, right?\n\n59:50.820 --> 59:54.220\n I can't have a boom mic over a scene.\n\n59:54.220 --> 59:58.220\n I want in creatively the opposite of that as well.\n\n59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.060\n So it's not just a logistical question,\n\n1:00:00.060 --> 1:00:04.340\n it's also a creative question to capture intimate moments\n\n1:00:04.340 --> 1:00:08.340\n where families are dealing with suffering children\n\n1:00:08.340 --> 1:00:11.700\n and dying children and caretaking is active\n\n1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:13.300\n and ongoing all the time.\n\n1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:15.340\n You don't want to interrupt that moment.\n\n1:00:15.340 --> 1:00:17.460\n And so that informs how I do things.\n\n1:00:17.460 --> 1:00:21.220\n So we go fleet and nimble and small.\n\n1:00:21.220 --> 1:00:22.900\n Those are all really good words.\n\n1:00:22.900 --> 1:00:26.100\n But so it's logistical on the one hand,\n\n1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:28.100\n but it's also a creative choice, right?\n\n1:00:28.100 --> 1:00:30.340\n So when we filmed Hunger Ward,\n\n1:00:30.340 --> 1:00:32.940\n two people were filming the entire film, right?\n\n1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:34.860\n Me and my director of photography.\n\n1:00:34.860 --> 1:00:36.380\n That was the two people in the room?\n\n1:00:36.380 --> 1:00:37.220\n Two people in the room.\n\n1:00:37.220 --> 1:00:38.060\n That's it.\n\n1:00:38.060 --> 1:00:38.900\n Yeah, that's it.\n\n1:00:38.900 --> 1:00:39.740\n The whole film, right?\n\n1:00:39.740 --> 1:00:41.500\n We had a field producer as well in this part of the country,\n\n1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:43.740\n but in terms of camera, it's just two people\n\n1:00:43.740 --> 1:00:45.060\n and we're doing everything.\n\n1:00:45.060 --> 1:00:49.860\n And we have lenses that are long enough\n\n1:00:49.860 --> 1:00:52.060\n that we don't have to move to camera.\n\n1:00:52.060 --> 1:00:53.620\n We don't have to move to capture the film.\n\n1:00:53.620 --> 1:00:56.620\n So we can tuck into a corner sometimes, right?\n\n1:00:56.620 --> 1:00:58.300\n And so just what's long mean?\n\n1:00:58.300 --> 1:00:59.940\n That means they're standing farther away\n\n1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:00.780\n and they can look.\n\n1:01:00.780 --> 1:01:02.220\n Zoom lens, it's not a prime lens.\n\n1:01:02.220 --> 1:01:04.060\n So it's not a fixed focal length, right?\n\n1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:04.900\n Because a fixed focal length,\n\n1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:07.740\n you have to move a lot more in order to capture action.\n\n1:01:07.740 --> 1:01:12.740\n With a zoom lens, maybe a 105 at the long end,\n\n1:01:12.900 --> 1:01:16.860\n I can tuck into a corner and just film from 15 feet away\n\n1:01:16.860 --> 1:01:18.980\n instead of having to get right up on someone, right?\n\n1:01:18.980 --> 1:01:21.940\n So you're less likely to interrupt the scene\n\n1:01:21.940 --> 1:01:25.900\n and you can kind of become the fly on the wall sometimes.\n\n1:01:25.900 --> 1:01:30.180\n So I'm very intentional about that piece of it\n\n1:01:30.180 --> 1:01:33.540\n so that we can capture those vulnerable moments\n\n1:01:33.540 --> 1:01:34.660\n and not interrupt them.\n\n1:01:36.340 --> 1:01:39.700\n That's really fascinating too, because the access,\n\n1:01:41.540 --> 1:01:42.860\n I don't often think about this,\n\n1:01:42.860 --> 1:01:44.860\n but that's probably true for me as well.\n\n1:01:44.860 --> 1:01:49.860\n Part of the storytelling is to be in the room.\n\n1:01:52.180 --> 1:01:53.700\n And that's the hard part.\n\n1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:56.380\n For me, most of my films, that's the hardest part.\n\n1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:59.860\n Actually, as hard as Hunger Ward and Lifeboat were to film\n\n1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:01.340\n and 50 Feet From Syria,\n\n1:02:02.540 --> 1:02:04.740\n the getting there piece of it for the last two\n\n1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:06.180\n was much harder.\n\n1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:09.340\n Yeah, and it's also, it's a creative act.\n\n1:02:09.340 --> 1:02:12.540\n It's, I don't know if it is for you,\n\n1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:15.140\n but it's the kind of people you talk to.\n\n1:02:15.140 --> 1:02:18.660\n It's like how you live your life.\n\n1:02:18.660 --> 1:02:21.100\n Like the kind of people I talk to right now,\n\n1:02:21.100 --> 1:02:22.780\n they steer the direction of my life\n\n1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:25.620\n and steer the direction of things I'll film.\n\n1:02:25.620 --> 1:02:28.340\n So it's not just like you're trying to get access.\n\n1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:30.980\n It's like, it's everything.\n\n1:02:30.980 --> 1:02:34.580\n It builds, it builds and builds and builds and builds.\n\n1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:36.420\n It builds on itself, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:02:36.420 --> 1:02:38.820\n I mean, part of the thing, even saying,\n\n1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:40.140\n talking about some of these leaders\n\n1:02:40.140 --> 1:02:41.860\n and conversations with them,\n\n1:02:41.860 --> 1:02:45.020\n it's almost like steering your life\n\n1:02:45.020 --> 1:02:47.820\n into the direction of the difficult,\n\n1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:50.140\n of like taking the leap.\n\n1:02:51.100 --> 1:02:54.740\n And if you're a good human being\n\n1:02:56.180 --> 1:03:00.460\n and a lot of people know who you are as a human,\n\n1:03:00.460 --> 1:03:04.140\n like not as a name, but as really who you are,\n\n1:03:04.140 --> 1:03:06.940\n that like putting that attention out there,\n\n1:03:06.940 --> 1:03:10.980\n it's somehow the world opens doors\n\n1:03:10.980 --> 1:03:14.300\n where the access becomes,\n\n1:03:14.300 --> 1:03:18.500\n the access that once seemed impossible becomes possible.\n\n1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:21.020\n And then all of that is a creative journey\n\n1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:22.180\n to be in the room.\n\n1:03:22.180 --> 1:03:23.620\n I think that probably is,\n\n1:03:23.620 --> 1:03:26.620\n I mean, it's true even for fiction films probably,\n\n1:03:26.620 --> 1:03:30.220\n is like everything that led to that,\n\n1:03:30.220 --> 1:03:33.380\n like to be in the room, the journey to be in the room\n\n1:03:33.380 --> 1:03:37.700\n and to shoot the scene is maybe more important\n\n1:03:37.700 --> 1:03:39.780\n than the scene itself.\n\n1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:42.820\n And like really focus on the creative act of that.\n\n1:03:42.820 --> 1:03:43.980\n Yeah, that's really fascinating.\n\n1:03:43.980 --> 1:03:45.980\n And especially, I mean, with a documentary,\n\n1:03:45.980 --> 1:03:47.700\n you get one take.\n\n1:03:47.700 --> 1:03:49.980\n Yeah, you can't say, hey, reset, right?\n\n1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:51.140\n Yeah, yeah, exactly.\n\n1:03:51.140 --> 1:03:53.140\n Ah, that is so interesting.\n\n1:03:53.140 --> 1:03:56.980\n As you were in some of the most difficult parts of the world\n\n1:03:57.900 --> 1:04:00.780\n in the room with some of the most difficult stories\n\n1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:02.060\n to be told.\n\n1:04:02.060 --> 1:04:05.780\n And yet, I think that's why I keep doing these stories.\n\n1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:10.060\n Because once you have that lived experience for me,\n\n1:04:15.260 --> 1:04:16.860\n it's moving.\n\n1:04:16.860 --> 1:04:20.780\n It moves me to bear witness\n\n1:04:20.780 --> 1:04:25.780\n to these inspiring people under difficult circumstances.\n\n1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:31.740\n And I can't come back to the US afterwards\n\n1:04:31.740 --> 1:04:35.660\n and walk down the grocery aisle\n\n1:04:35.660 --> 1:04:40.220\n where there's 50 different choices for canned peas, right?\n\n1:04:40.220 --> 1:04:45.060\n And not sort of feel that lived tension, right?\n\n1:04:45.060 --> 1:04:47.260\n That lived tension of the privilege\n\n1:04:47.260 --> 1:04:49.220\n that I have here in the US.\n\n1:04:49.220 --> 1:04:52.060\n And then I have a choice about what to do\n\n1:04:52.060 --> 1:04:54.020\n with that privilege, right?\n\n1:04:54.020 --> 1:04:56.460\n And the last thing I wanna do is start\n\n1:04:58.380 --> 1:05:01.140\n doing stories about dandelions, right?\n\n1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:02.740\n There's far more important things to do\n\n1:05:02.740 --> 1:05:05.700\n on this very limited time that I have on the planet.\n\n1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:10.700\n And I think that's catalytic for me.\n\n1:05:12.140 --> 1:05:17.140\n Like I feel that mortality each day.\n\n1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:22.420\n And my goal is to tell as many of these stories\n\n1:05:25.780 --> 1:05:26.700\n before I'm gone.\n\n1:05:26.700 --> 1:05:30.980\n Could you speak to the getting access?\n\n1:05:31.980 --> 1:05:36.180\n Is this just, you know, is there interesting stories\n\n1:05:36.180 --> 1:05:41.180\n of how a weird or funny or profound ways\n\n1:05:43.020 --> 1:05:45.100\n that led you to get access to a room?\n\n1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:46.860\n Each one is a different adventure.\n\n1:05:46.860 --> 1:05:47.700\n And it's definitely an adventure.\n\n1:05:47.700 --> 1:05:48.540\n It's an adventure.\n\n1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:49.860\n Everyone's an adventure, yeah.\n\n1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:51.980\n Probably one of the easiest ones I ever had\n\n1:05:51.980 --> 1:05:54.980\n in the recent past was for 50 Feet from Syria\n\n1:05:54.980 --> 1:05:59.980\n where I literally broke my hand in a bicycle race.\n\n1:06:01.980 --> 1:06:06.060\n And after many months of trying to get an appointment\n\n1:06:06.060 --> 1:06:09.180\n with an orthopedic hand surgeon, a specialist,\n\n1:06:09.180 --> 1:06:11.700\n I finally did and he was Syrian American.\n\n1:06:11.700 --> 1:06:14.820\n And the Syrian conflict had just begun\n\n1:06:14.820 --> 1:06:16.620\n and we just started talking about it.\n\n1:06:16.620 --> 1:06:21.060\n And after he looked at my hand in the first five minutes,\n\n1:06:21.060 --> 1:06:23.260\n he's like, yeah, you need surgery, great.\n\n1:06:23.260 --> 1:06:25.860\n But then somehow we started talking about Syria\n\n1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:28.380\n and like five minutes in, he just stood up\n\n1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:30.700\n and like put the privacy curtain around us,\n\n1:06:30.700 --> 1:06:33.060\n supposed to be a 15 minute appointment or so.\n\n1:06:33.060 --> 1:06:35.340\n And we talked for an hour, right?\n\n1:06:35.340 --> 1:06:37.380\n So, you know, those moments\n\n1:06:37.380 --> 1:06:40.820\n of sort of mysterious confluence happen, right?\n\n1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:43.340\n And I think you have to be open to them when they do happen\n\n1:06:43.340 --> 1:06:46.700\n because I'm a storyteller, I'm always looking as well, right?\n\n1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:50.460\n So, because he then contacted me later and said,\n\n1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:54.180\n Skye, I am going back to the Syrian border to volunteer\n\n1:06:54.180 --> 1:06:56.580\n as a surgeon, do you want to come with me?\n\n1:06:56.580 --> 1:06:57.460\n That was an easy one.\n\n1:06:57.460 --> 1:06:58.960\n That's probably the easiest one I could give you.\n\n1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.220\n But it came out of this interesting moment,\n\n1:07:01.220 --> 1:07:02.900\n very personal moment, right?\n\n1:07:02.900 --> 1:07:05.780\n Lifeboat and Hunger Ward are completely different.\n\n1:07:07.380 --> 1:07:11.340\n And I had to really work hard to gain access\n\n1:07:11.340 --> 1:07:12.420\n to those stories.\n\n1:07:12.420 --> 1:07:14.420\n So you intentionally thought like what,\n\n1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:18.340\n I want to get access to the story.\n\n1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:20.500\n And then what are the different ideas?\n\n1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:24.500\n And they often might involve a doctor or a dentist\n\n1:07:24.500 --> 1:07:29.500\n or just being maybe intentionally and aggressively open\n\n1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:34.320\n to experiences that lead you into the room.\n\n1:07:35.580 --> 1:07:38.900\n So it's funny you mentioned the doctor\n\n1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:41.760\n because I have similar experiences now.\n\n1:07:42.740 --> 1:07:47.740\n I've just gotten access to all kinds of fascinating people\n\n1:07:47.740 --> 1:07:50.000\n in the same way.\n\n1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:50.840\n They're all around us.\n\n1:07:50.840 --> 1:07:52.160\n They're all around us.\n\n1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.000\n You just have to look.\n\n1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:53.840\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:55.520\n It's like there's fascinating people everywhere\n\n1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:57.240\n who are doing incredible things,\n\n1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.480\n but we have to be open and keep our eyes open\n\n1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:04.160\n and realize that there are amazing human beings everywhere.\n\n1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:07.720\n Yeah, there's networks that connect people\n\n1:08:07.720 --> 1:08:09.080\n just through life.\n\n1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:12.560\n You meet people, you share a beer or a drink\n\n1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.800\n or just you fall in love\n\n1:08:14.800 --> 1:08:18.600\n or you share trauma together.\n\n1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:19.920\n You go through a hard time together.\n\n1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:22.560\n And those little sticky things connects us humans.\n\n1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:24.840\n And if you just keep yourself open\n\n1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:27.880\n and embrace the curiosity.\n\n1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:30.040\n And then also the persistence, I suppose.\n\n1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:35.040\n Like how long have you chased access?\n\n1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.640\n Does it take days, weeks, months, years?\n\n1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.080\n Lex, I'm not the most talented filmmaker in the world.\n\n1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:46.160\n I'm not the smartest guy in the world.\n\n1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:48.200\n I think if there's qualities\n\n1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:50.640\n that have served me well in my career,\n\n1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:53.200\n it's persistence and tenacity, right?\n\n1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:56.960\n I've always been sort of a slow burn human being.\n\n1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:00.240\n Like I would never hit a home run,\n\n1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:03.240\n but I hit a first, right?\n\n1:09:03.240 --> 1:09:04.160\n A single to first,\n\n1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:06.560\n and then I'd hit another single to first.\n\n1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:09.460\n So I ran a marathon when I was 18.\n\n1:09:09.460 --> 1:09:11.520\n And I think that is illustrative\n\n1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:14.480\n of sort of how my career has been.\n\n1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:16.040\n I just keep going.\n\n1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.640\n And I believe in this notion of incremental evolution\n\n1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:23.980\n that with each project, I try to learn from it\n\n1:09:23.980 --> 1:09:28.160\n and take away lessons learned and improve my craft, right?\n\n1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:33.000\n And improve how I leverage that craft\n\n1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.280\n and improve how I tell the story\n\n1:09:35.280 --> 1:09:37.880\n from a narrative standpoint each time.\n\n1:09:37.880 --> 1:09:41.800\n So that on the next project, it's a little bit better.\n\n1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:43.740\n And that's the arc of my career\n\n1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:47.400\n is learning, learning, evolving, evolving,\n\n1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:50.480\n so that I can make a little better film the next time.\n\n1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:52.420\n How do you gain people's trust?\n\n1:09:53.280 --> 1:09:56.640\n Like for example, there's a line between journalists\n\n1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.520\n and documentary filmmakers.\n\n1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.320\n Nobody really trusts journalists.\n\n1:10:00.320 --> 1:10:03.840\n Yeah, right, exactly.\n\n1:10:03.840 --> 1:10:06.480\n But a documentary filmmaker,\n\n1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:09.480\n of course I'm joking, half joking.\n\n1:10:09.480 --> 1:10:12.160\n I don't know which percentage joking, but some truth.\n\n1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:15.560\n But documentary filmmaker is a kind of storyteller,\n\n1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:18.880\n an artist, and somehow that's more trustworthy\n\n1:10:18.880 --> 1:10:22.560\n because you're on the same side in some way.\n\n1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:23.400\n I don't know.\n\n1:10:23.400 --> 1:10:25.360\n Maybe on the same side, yeah.\n\n1:10:25.360 --> 1:10:26.640\n Is there something to be said\n\n1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:29.600\n how you gain the trust of people to gain access?\n\n1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:32.820\n Are you just trying to be a good human being?\n\n1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:35.560\n Is there something to be said there?\n\n1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:37.360\n Well, so I do draw a distinction\n\n1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:40.120\n between journalism and filmmaking\n\n1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:42.520\n because I think you're right, they're different.\n\n1:10:42.520 --> 1:10:44.600\n And there are some filmmakers who do hue\n\n1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:47.880\n to sort of the journalistic tenets\n\n1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.620\n of who, what, where, when, why,\n\n1:10:49.620 --> 1:10:51.400\n fair and balanced on both sides, right?\n\n1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:52.780\n Make sure everyone has a voice.\n\n1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:53.620\n I don't.\n\n1:10:53.620 --> 1:10:55.080\n If you say fair and balanced,\n\n1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:58.300\n you're rarely either fair or balanced.\n\n1:10:58.300 --> 1:10:59.680\n I've seen that with journalists.\n\n1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:02.800\n Journalists often, unfortunately, in my perspective,\n\n1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:05.520\n sorry to interrupt you rudely and go on a rant,\n\n1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:07.640\n but they seem to have. Go on a rant, do it.\n\n1:11:07.640 --> 1:11:09.760\n They seem to have an agenda.\n\n1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:12.160\n As opposed to seeking to truly tell a story\n\n1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:13.520\n or to truly understand,\n\n1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:18.040\n especially when they're talking to people\n\n1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:24.240\n who have some degree of evil in them.\n\n1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:25.740\n Well, we all have an agenda, right?\n\n1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:27.040\n I think in anything we do,\n\n1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:30.480\n whether it's like to seek truth\n\n1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:32.580\n or some larger principle,\n\n1:11:32.580 --> 1:11:35.980\n I always have an agenda.\n\n1:11:35.980 --> 1:11:40.820\n I chose to work with civilians and caretakers in Yemen\n\n1:11:40.820 --> 1:11:44.660\n on Hunger Ward rather than to go interview MBS, right?\n\n1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:46.900\n That's what I'm interested in\n\n1:11:46.900 --> 1:11:49.240\n is bringing that to the world, right?\n\n1:11:50.540 --> 1:11:55.540\n But in terms of building relationships and trust,\n\n1:11:55.800 --> 1:11:59.100\n it's really, I think about transparency\n\n1:11:59.100 --> 1:12:00.700\n as much as anything else\n\n1:12:00.700 --> 1:12:03.340\n and going in in a collaborative sense.\n\n1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:08.340\n So I don't think of the people\n\n1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:12.580\n that I film with as subjects, for example.\n\n1:12:12.580 --> 1:12:14.340\n I think of them as collaborators.\n\n1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:17.700\n So it's a different mindset that I go into projects with.\n\n1:12:17.700 --> 1:12:18.540\n That's beautiful.\n\n1:12:18.540 --> 1:12:19.900\n And it's based on relationships, right?\n\n1:12:19.900 --> 1:12:22.260\n You have to build relationships with other human beings,\n\n1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:24.920\n however you can, and that takes time\n\n1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.660\n and it takes listening and it's active.\n\n1:12:28.660 --> 1:12:32.940\n So I've talked about the notion of consent before,\n\n1:12:32.940 --> 1:12:36.680\n which is so important in nonfiction film.\n\n1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:40.420\n And I hew to this idea that\n\n1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:45.180\n you don't just slide a piece of paper in front of someone,\n\n1:12:45.180 --> 1:12:47.240\n have release form and have them sign it, right?\n\n1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:48.580\n And then you're done.\n\n1:12:48.580 --> 1:12:51.740\n That's not the nature of true consent in my mind.\n\n1:12:51.740 --> 1:12:56.740\n It's you have to work on a foundation of active consent\n\n1:12:56.740 --> 1:12:59.120\n every single day that you're working with someone.\n\n1:12:59.120 --> 1:13:01.240\n And that's based on relationship, right?\n\n1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:02.500\n And it's based on dialogue.\n\n1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:05.800\n So it's trust that I'm always aiming for.\n\n1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:07.760\n It's the building of relationships,\n\n1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:08.620\n which I'm always aiming for,\n\n1:13:08.620 --> 1:13:13.160\n which is why yesterday I got a bunch of photos\n\n1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:15.320\n from Dr. Al Sadiq in the South of Yemen.\n\n1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:17.360\n And she sends me photos all the time\n\n1:13:17.360 --> 1:13:19.920\n of the children that she's currently treating\n\n1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:21.720\n because we have an active relationship\n\n1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:24.560\n that's continues on and probably will\n\n1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:26.160\n for many years to come.\n\n1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.360\n So it's going to continue.\n\n1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:32.020\n And that's the only way that I can do these kinds of films.\n\n1:13:32.020 --> 1:13:36.720\n Let me ask you about silly little details of filming.\n\n1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:41.400\n Before we go to the big picture stories,\n\n1:13:42.660 --> 1:13:46.080\n cameras, lenses, how much do those matter?\n\n1:13:46.080 --> 1:13:47.880\n You mentioned director of photography.\n\n1:13:47.880 --> 1:13:52.880\n What's your, how much do you love the feel,\n\n1:13:52.880 --> 1:13:56.940\n the smell of equipment that does the visual filming?\n\n1:13:56.940 --> 1:13:59.100\n You know, there's some people, they're just like,\n\n1:13:59.100 --> 1:14:03.100\n ah, they love lenses.\n\n1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:05.900\n How much do you love that or versus how much\n\n1:14:05.900 --> 1:14:08.220\n do you focus on the story or the access\n\n1:14:08.220 --> 1:14:09.060\n and all those kinds of things?\n\n1:14:09.060 --> 1:14:14.060\n I'm not a tech geek, but because during the bulk\n\n1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:18.460\n of my career, I've worked as a director of photography\n\n1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:21.540\n myself for other people in order to pay the bills\n\n1:14:21.540 --> 1:14:25.660\n over the years, you know, I know the technical side of it\n\n1:14:25.660 --> 1:14:29.040\n because I've had to know it and I've had to train myself\n\n1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:29.880\n and learn it.\n\n1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:33.740\n So I see them as necessary tools.\n\n1:14:33.740 --> 1:14:38.500\n And again, because I believe, you know,\n\n1:14:38.500 --> 1:14:43.140\n film and cinema is and should be visually driven\n\n1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:45.680\n and not verbally driven.\n\n1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:49.460\n I want the best tools possible within my means, right?\n\n1:14:49.460 --> 1:14:53.860\n And within the logistical ability of the project\n\n1:14:53.860 --> 1:14:56.260\n because we have to go so small, right?\n\n1:14:56.260 --> 1:15:00.860\n I can't afford nor can I bring a huge $100,000 lens.\n\n1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:02.820\n So if I gave you a trillion dollars.\n\n1:15:02.820 --> 1:15:03.800\n A trillion dollars?\n\n1:15:03.800 --> 1:15:04.640\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:05.480\n Wow.\n\n1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:06.300\n Unlimited.\n\n1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:07.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:07.140 --> 1:15:08.460\n There's still huge constraints that have nothing\n\n1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:09.300\n to do with money.\n\n1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:10.140\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:10.140 --> 1:15:10.960\n Like you just said.\n\n1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:11.800\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:13.840\n So what cameras would you use?\n\n1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:16.060\n You know what I'd do with a trillion dollars?\n\n1:15:16.060 --> 1:15:16.900\n I could do a lot with a trillion dollars.\n\n1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:17.740\n You're not allowed.\n\n1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:21.740\n You're only allowed to fund the film and no corrupt stuff\n\n1:15:21.740 --> 1:15:24.900\n where you like use the film to actually help children.\n\n1:15:24.900 --> 1:15:26.420\n No, you're not allowed to do any of that.\n\n1:15:26.420 --> 1:15:28.540\n What I would do with a trillion is I wouldn't invest in it.\n\n1:15:28.540 --> 1:15:29.860\n Well, I guess I would invest in current.\n\n1:15:29.860 --> 1:15:33.460\n I would increase capacity to do more films.\n\n1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:34.300\n What I would do.\n\n1:15:34.300 --> 1:15:37.740\n So I would buy basically the perfect little,\n\n1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:40.760\n you know, mini equipment set, right?\n\n1:15:40.760 --> 1:15:43.980\n But then I would train three teams maybe\n\n1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:45.940\n to do the same thing that I've been doing\n\n1:15:45.940 --> 1:15:48.340\n so we could multiply and scale up.\n\n1:15:48.340 --> 1:15:49.300\n More and more stories.\n\n1:15:49.300 --> 1:15:51.060\n Yeah, that's what I would do with the money.\n\n1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:52.500\n But the actual setup.\n\n1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:54.700\n Would remain small and nimble.\n\n1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:55.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:15:56.620 --> 1:15:59.820\n And what about lighting?\n\n1:15:59.820 --> 1:16:01.780\n Do you usually use natural light?\n\n1:16:01.780 --> 1:16:03.120\n Do you ever do?\n\n1:16:04.260 --> 1:16:06.300\n I mean, sorry for the technical questions here,\n\n1:16:06.300 --> 1:16:11.300\n but highlighting the drama of the human face.\n\n1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:12.600\n Yeah.\n\n1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:14.820\n That's the visual.\n\n1:16:14.820 --> 1:16:15.660\n That's art.\n\n1:16:15.660 --> 1:16:20.660\n That's like, to reveal reality at its deepest is art.\n\n1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:24.980\n And do you use lighting?\n\n1:16:24.980 --> 1:16:27.100\n Lighting's such a big part of that.\n\n1:16:27.100 --> 1:16:28.460\n Do you ever do artificial lighting?\n\n1:16:28.460 --> 1:16:30.120\n Do you try to do natural always?\n\n1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:33.260\n You know the best lighting instrument in the world?\n\n1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:34.740\n Is the sun.\n\n1:16:34.740 --> 1:16:37.020\n At the right moment of the day.\n\n1:16:37.020 --> 1:16:40.780\n And so I predominantly use natural light\n\n1:16:40.780 --> 1:16:45.780\n at certain moments and just shape natural light\n\n1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:51.700\n during the course of these small human rights stocks.\n\n1:16:51.700 --> 1:16:54.680\n That's not to say we don't bring instruments sometimes,\n\n1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:59.680\n but when we do, they're very small and again, compact.\n\n1:17:00.020 --> 1:17:05.020\n So for example, I have this small little tube kit\n\n1:17:05.340 --> 1:17:07.020\n that's just three instruments, right?\n\n1:17:07.020 --> 1:17:08.400\n That you can charge with USB.\n\n1:17:08.400 --> 1:17:11.940\n Because electricity is often a major issue where we go.\n\n1:17:11.940 --> 1:17:15.020\n So there's just three little tube lights with magnetic backs\n\n1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:17.780\n that if we find in a situation where, you know,\n\n1:17:17.780 --> 1:17:20.780\n we can't get enough exposure for a hallway or something,\n\n1:17:20.780 --> 1:17:22.800\n and we have the time to throw it up,\n\n1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.540\n we'll throw it up if people are walking,\n\n1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:27.140\n if collaborators are walking down that hallway a lot,\n\n1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:29.980\n for example, at night, just so we can see them, right?\n\n1:17:29.980 --> 1:17:31.520\n So it's instances like that.\n\n1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:35.580\n Or if we do do an interview, which we don't do very often,\n\n1:17:35.580 --> 1:17:40.580\n but if we do, just so we have a key light on the face, right?\n\n1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:43.380\n And always bring a reflector or two, you know,\n\n1:17:43.380 --> 1:17:46.820\n just to shape natural light as well in ways.\n\n1:17:46.820 --> 1:17:51.820\n But it's about shaping rather than producing light for us.\n\n1:17:53.060 --> 1:17:55.860\n Got it, as we sit surrounded by black curtains\n\n1:17:55.860 --> 1:17:57.620\n in complete natural light.\n\n1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:02.140\n So just so you know, this room is like a violation\n\n1:18:02.140 --> 1:18:07.140\n of the basic principles of using the sun.\n\n1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:13.120\n So behind the large curtains are giant windows.\n\n1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:13.960\n Yeah.\n\n1:18:13.960 --> 1:18:14.960\n So this whole.\n\n1:18:14.960 --> 1:18:15.800\n Should I rip them open?\n\n1:18:15.800 --> 1:18:19.060\n Should I rip open the curtains real quick?\n\n1:18:19.060 --> 1:18:21.400\n How much of the work is done in the edit?\n\n1:18:21.400 --> 1:18:24.280\n That's another question I'm curious about.\n\n1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:28.880\n And how much do you sort of anticipate that?\n\n1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:30.720\n Like when you're actually shooting,\n\n1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:35.720\n are you thinking of the final story as it appears on screen\n\n1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.800\n or are you just collecting, as a human,\n\n1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:42.920\n collecting little bits of story here and there\n\n1:18:42.920 --> 1:18:46.560\n and in the edit is where most of the storytelling happens?\n\n1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:49.400\n I've developed this sort of mental paradigm\n\n1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:53.960\n for myself over the years that speaks to that.\n\n1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:56.720\n And I call it the three creations, right?\n\n1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:00.960\n And so when I'm doing a film, the first creation for me\n\n1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:05.860\n is my preconception or visualization\n\n1:19:05.860 --> 1:19:09.440\n of what the film is going to be before I shoot it, right?\n\n1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:14.440\n So I have this entire vision of what a film's gonna be.\n\n1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:16.920\n And sometimes it can be pretty specific.\n\n1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:18.640\n Like I'll think through the scenes\n\n1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.800\n if I know the locations and everything,\n\n1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:24.440\n and I'll have this idea of what I'm gonna create, right?\n\n1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:26.760\n And then I'm there filming, right?\n\n1:19:26.760 --> 1:19:30.960\n And always without fail, reality is something\n\n1:19:30.960 --> 1:19:33.880\n altogether different than what I thought it would be.\n\n1:19:33.880 --> 1:19:35.520\n But it's still good to have the original idea.\n\n1:19:35.520 --> 1:19:38.560\n Yeah, yeah, but if I tried to hold to that original vision,\n\n1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:41.400\n right, and to create a film out of that idea,\n\n1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:43.440\n they'd be crap, all the films would be crap.\n\n1:19:43.440 --> 1:19:46.200\n So I have to adapt, I have to evolve my approach\n\n1:19:46.200 --> 1:19:49.880\n and then embrace what is actually occurring\n\n1:19:49.880 --> 1:19:53.060\n with the people actually doing it and then reenvision.\n\n1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:55.180\n So that reenvision is very active\n\n1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:57.120\n during the entire filming process.\n\n1:19:57.120 --> 1:19:58.960\n And so that's the second creation,\n\n1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:02.880\n that's the rethinking and revisualizing\n\n1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:05.720\n based on what we're actually experiencing and seeing\n\n1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:08.000\n what this film is going to be.\n\n1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.380\n And then I finished filming, right?\n\n1:20:11.380 --> 1:20:13.080\n And we bring the hard drives back\n\n1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:16.600\n and we plug in the hard drives in the edit bay.\n\n1:20:16.600 --> 1:20:20.420\n And oftentimes, because it's two of us filming\n\n1:20:20.420 --> 1:20:23.720\n most of the time, I haven't seen all the footage.\n\n1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:26.920\n Because in the field, it's all about just filming, right?\n\n1:20:26.920 --> 1:20:28.740\n And then just transferring the footage\n\n1:20:28.740 --> 1:20:31.840\n and getting on safely, you know, clone to multiple drives.\n\n1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:33.600\n I don't have a chance to review everything.\n\n1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:36.400\n I can't do rushes like you do on a large feature.\n\n1:20:36.400 --> 1:20:38.480\n So because I'm filming half of it,\n\n1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:40.800\n I know what I've filmed, right?\n\n1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:42.200\n But I haven't seen everything\n\n1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:45.080\n the director of photography has filmed, right?\n\n1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:50.080\n So the next stage for me is reviewing every single frame\n\n1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:51.920\n of what's been filmed.\n\n1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:56.040\n And that's where discovery happens the third time, right?\n\n1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:57.760\n Or the second time rather is,\n\n1:20:57.760 --> 1:21:01.580\n wow, now I thought we'd filmed this,\n\n1:21:01.580 --> 1:21:05.040\n but actually there's this over here.\n\n1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:07.400\n And then I have to open up this second vision\n\n1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:10.080\n and turn it and transform it into a third vision\n\n1:21:10.080 --> 1:21:12.880\n for the film based on what's actually on the hard drive.\n\n1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:15.640\n So is this like a daily process?\n\n1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:17.880\n So what I do, my process is that\n\n1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:21.040\n if it's a really difficult project,\n\n1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:23.400\n I'll take a break before I go through this\n\n1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:25.160\n just for healing, you know,\n\n1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:27.400\n and some space away and fresh eyes.\n\n1:21:27.400 --> 1:21:29.120\n And usually that's about a month.\n\n1:21:29.120 --> 1:21:32.480\n And then once I reengage, I reengage whole hog,\n\n1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:37.140\n I reengage fully and I review every single frame.\n\n1:21:37.140 --> 1:21:40.560\n And as I do that, I create a spreadsheet.\n\n1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:43.240\n And for Hunger War, that spreadsheet was,\n\n1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:45.880\n I don't know, 1500 lines long or something\n\n1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:48.100\n where it's basically log notes.\n\n1:21:48.100 --> 1:21:51.320\n And I watch every scene and I take notes\n\n1:21:51.320 --> 1:21:54.200\n and I know really what we have.\n\n1:21:54.200 --> 1:21:55.880\n And once I've gone through that process\n\n1:21:55.880 --> 1:21:57.320\n that takes about a month\n\n1:21:57.320 --> 1:21:59.880\n and I really know what we came back with,\n\n1:21:59.880 --> 1:22:02.800\n I create an outline for the film from that.\n\n1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:04.780\n And that's the third visioning, right?\n\n1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:07.580\n That's usually completely different\n\n1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:10.800\n than my original vision for the film to some extent, right?\n\n1:22:10.800 --> 1:22:14.280\n But I have to stay open to that entire process\n\n1:22:14.280 --> 1:22:17.080\n or I'd be trying to create something\n\n1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:19.640\n that I can't really create.\n\n1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:22.680\n So I think those are the three creations for me.\n\n1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:25.820\n That's so cool to know what we have,\n\n1:22:27.500 --> 1:22:31.960\n just to lay it all out and to load it in into your mind.\n\n1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:35.820\n Cause like, this is the capture of reality we have.\n\n1:22:35.820 --> 1:22:37.820\n It's a very kind of scientific process too.\n\n1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:39.480\n Cause you know, in science,\n\n1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:41.880\n you collect a bunch of data about a phenomena\n\n1:22:41.880 --> 1:22:43.700\n and now you have to like analyze that data,\n\n1:22:43.700 --> 1:22:46.040\n but now your phenomena is long gone.\n\n1:22:46.040 --> 1:22:46.960\n Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.\n\n1:22:46.960 --> 1:22:47.800\n Now you just have the data.\n\n1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:51.240\n Just the data and you have to write a paper about it,\n\n1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:54.000\n like analyze the data, it's similar things.\n\n1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.440\n You have to like load it all in.\n\n1:22:55.440 --> 1:22:56.900\n Where's the story?\n\n1:22:56.900 --> 1:23:01.900\n How do you, that last probably profound piece\n\n1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:07.060\n of doing the editing, like in your mind,\n\n1:23:07.060 --> 1:23:10.240\n like how to lay those things out?\n\n1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:12.200\n Well, it's almost like the scientific process, right?\n\n1:23:12.200 --> 1:23:15.320\n I have a hypothesis, a creative hypothesis, right?\n\n1:23:15.320 --> 1:23:17.040\n Not a scientific one.\n\n1:23:17.040 --> 1:23:19.080\n But then I'm testing the hypothesis\n\n1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:20.960\n during the course of filming, right?\n\n1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:24.280\n And I have to stay true to what the data tells me\n\n1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.740\n in the end creatively.\n\n1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:27.520\n So it's very similar to the scientific processes.\n\n1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:30.200\n I don't know what we should, we should probably coin that.\n\n1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:31.200\n Yeah, that's pretty good.\n\n1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:34.660\n Creative scientific process or something like that.\n\n1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:38.260\n But then you actually do the edit and then you watch,\n\n1:23:38.260 --> 1:23:41.300\n that's also iterative in a sense,\n\n1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:45.200\n because maybe when you have a film,\n\n1:23:45.200 --> 1:23:48.440\n that's 20, 30, 40 minutes, or if it's feature length,\n\n1:23:50.260 --> 1:23:54.600\n like do you ever have it where it sucks?\n\n1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:55.440\n Like it's not at all.\n\n1:23:55.440 --> 1:23:56.720\n Is there a stage where it sucks?\n\n1:23:56.720 --> 1:23:58.720\n Like a stage where, right, right.\n\n1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:01.380\n Like it's where it's like, no, this is not,\n\n1:24:01.380 --> 1:24:03.900\n this is not what I was, like when it's all put together\n\n1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:07.000\n in this way, this doesn't, this is not working right.\n\n1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:08.780\n This is not right.\n\n1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:12.100\n Or do you, is it always like an incremental step\n\n1:24:12.100 --> 1:24:13.000\n towards better and better?\n\n1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:13.920\n It's incremental.\n\n1:24:13.920 --> 1:24:14.920\n Yeah, it's incremental.\n\n1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:18.360\n Yeah, and there's always some moment in the editing process\n\n1:24:18.360 --> 1:24:19.960\n where there's a breakthrough,\n\n1:24:19.960 --> 1:24:24.360\n where suddenly I understand how it fits together more fully.\n\n1:24:24.360 --> 1:24:26.120\n And you have to be, like you said, resilient.\n\n1:24:26.120 --> 1:24:28.560\n You have to be patient that that moment will come.\n\n1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:29.480\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:31.440\n Are you ultra self critical\n\n1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:35.400\n or are you generally optimistic and patient?\n\n1:24:35.400 --> 1:24:38.520\n I don't think those are mutually exclusive.\n\n1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:40.240\n Right, so you just oscillate\n\n1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:42.440\n or are they like dance partners or something?\n\n1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.120\n They're dance partners, yeah.\n\n1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:47.400\n Definitely dancing all the way through the process.\n\n1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:51.460\n By way of advice, you know, to young filmmakers,\n\n1:24:52.680 --> 1:24:57.680\n how to film something that is recognized\n\n1:24:58.380 --> 1:25:00.600\n by the world in some way.\n\n1:25:00.600 --> 1:25:05.340\n I would say, you know, first off, learn your craft, right?\n\n1:25:05.340 --> 1:25:10.340\n Because I think craft is incredibly foundational, right?\n\n1:25:11.360 --> 1:25:14.440\n To creating a powerful story.\n\n1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:16.560\n And sorry to interrupt, but when you say craft,\n\n1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:18.740\n do you mean just the raw technical,\n\n1:25:18.740 --> 1:25:21.760\n the director of photography, like the filming aspect?\n\n1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:24.480\n Is it the storytelling, is it the access, the whole thing?\n\n1:25:24.480 --> 1:25:25.920\n I think craft is more than just knowing\n\n1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:28.720\n how to push record on a camera or what lens to use, right?\n\n1:25:28.720 --> 1:25:30.480\n That's part of it, right?\n\n1:25:30.480 --> 1:25:35.080\n But I think at least in nonfiction,\n\n1:25:35.080 --> 1:25:38.640\n you know, I'm a product to some extent\n\n1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:42.560\n of having to know how to do it all, right?\n\n1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:44.720\n Having to teach myself how to do it all.\n\n1:25:44.720 --> 1:25:47.020\n Because I didn't go to film school, you know?\n\n1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:53.020\n But I became so enamored of telling stories through a camera.\n\n1:25:54.600 --> 1:25:55.720\n What was the leap, by the way,\n\n1:25:55.720 --> 1:25:57.960\n from theater to storyteller?\n\n1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:00.880\n Oh, I just needed an extra class in grad school.\n\n1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:03.760\n I was in a MFA directing class\n\n1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:06.240\n and I needed an extra class and I just sort of like\n\n1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:09.720\n talked my way into a television directing class\n\n1:26:09.720 --> 1:26:11.720\n and fell in love with it.\n\n1:26:11.720 --> 1:26:14.160\n And the actor became the director.\n\n1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:15.500\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:18.200\n Well, yeah, I mean, I wasn't an actor,\n\n1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:21.640\n but I had to act and I had to know the craft of acting\n\n1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:22.960\n because I was in the theater, you know,\n\n1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:24.720\n to work with actors. Did you love it, though?\n\n1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.000\n Did you love acting? The theater?\n\n1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:28.180\n Yeah, theater?\n\n1:26:28.180 --> 1:26:30.820\n The first, yeah, as an undergraduate, yeah.\n\n1:26:30.820 --> 1:26:32.040\n But then I learned pretty quickly\n\n1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:36.440\n that I was pretty bad at it, or at least not very good,\n\n1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.320\n and that my skills lay elsewhere\n\n1:26:39.320 --> 1:26:42.520\n in more sort of behind the scenes and shaping a story.\n\n1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:45.560\n When you started taking a class,\n\n1:26:45.560 --> 1:26:48.760\n but also telling stories as a director,\n\n1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:53.760\n did you quickly realize that you're pretty good at this\n\n1:26:53.760 --> 1:26:55.100\n or was it a grind?\n\n1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:58.680\n That's a good question, Max.\n\n1:26:58.680 --> 1:27:02.280\n I think, I definitely knew right away\n\n1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:05.440\n that it was more my wheelhouse, right?\n\n1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:07.360\n And I think part of that was because\n\n1:27:09.560 --> 1:27:13.200\n I grew up in sort of a world of imagination.\n\n1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.040\n And I think that active imagination as a child\n\n1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:21.080\n really lent itself well to the skillset\n\n1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:23.960\n that a director needs, right?\n\n1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:26.760\n To shape story, to shape narrative, to shape performances.\n\n1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:29.640\n So I think it was a much more natural fit for me.\n\n1:27:29.640 --> 1:27:31.840\n Was I excellent at the beginning?\n\n1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:36.000\n Heck no, no, I think few people are, but I learned.\n\n1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.920\n Where was the biggest struggle for you?\n\n1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:41.600\n Is it, so your imagination clearly was something\n\n1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:43.600\n that you worked on for a lifetime.\n\n1:27:43.600 --> 1:27:46.480\n So I'm sure that was pretty strong.\n\n1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:47.920\n Books, came from books.\n\n1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:49.320\n Books.\n\n1:27:49.320 --> 1:27:52.000\n But the actual conversion of the imagination,\n\n1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:53.960\n you said shape the story.\n\n1:27:53.960 --> 1:27:56.840\n Where was the skill most lacking\n\n1:27:56.840 --> 1:27:59.080\n in the shaping of the story initially?\n\n1:27:59.080 --> 1:27:59.920\n Technical side.\n\n1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:00.760\n Just technical side.\n\n1:28:00.760 --> 1:28:01.580\n Yeah, like, you know,\n\n1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:03.840\n cause I taught myself everything.\n\n1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:05.640\n What kind of microphone should I use, right?\n\n1:28:05.640 --> 1:28:06.480\n What kind of camera?\n\n1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:07.560\n What does this lens do?\n\n1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:08.720\n What's that lens do?\n\n1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.100\n I didn't know any of that.\n\n1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:11.440\n And so I essentially was,\n\n1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:14.200\n I have been self taught, technically.\n\n1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:15.600\n How do you get good technically,\n\n1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:16.840\n would you say, when you're self taught?\n\n1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:18.240\n Just doing it over and over again.\n\n1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:20.840\n And what kind of stories were you telling?\n\n1:28:20.840 --> 1:28:24.280\n I began shooting local commercials for.\n\n1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:25.160\n For money?\n\n1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:26.000\n For money, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:27.840\n So you're doing professional projects?\n\n1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:28.680\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:28:28.680 --> 1:28:31.240\n And so I kind of learned on the job as I did it.\n\n1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:32.840\n How many hobby projects did you do,\n\n1:28:32.840 --> 1:28:34.080\n just for the hell of it?\n\n1:28:34.080 --> 1:28:35.880\n Or were you trying to focus on the professional?\n\n1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:37.320\n Well, I was trying to make money, right?\n\n1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:39.400\n Right out of grad school, just to pay the rent.\n\n1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:42.440\n And that's a forcing function to,\n\n1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:45.680\n I mean, I personally love having my back to the wall\n\n1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:48.920\n or financially you're screwed if you don't succeed.\n\n1:28:48.920 --> 1:28:50.480\n So that's nice.\n\n1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:51.960\n I mean, I lived out of the trunk of my car\n\n1:28:51.960 --> 1:28:53.720\n for a couple of years after grad school,\n\n1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:56.360\n just freelancing, just like,\n\n1:28:56.360 --> 1:29:00.320\n but that couple of years really helped me learn fast\n\n1:29:00.320 --> 1:29:02.480\n because I had to learn fast.\n\n1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:05.880\n So I did a couple of voyages around the world\n\n1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:08.160\n for this group called Semester at Sea,\n\n1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:09.580\n that is a floating university\n\n1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:11.880\n that where they go out three and a half months at a time\n\n1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:15.120\n with about 500 college level students\n\n1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:16.520\n and about 35 professors.\n\n1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:19.480\n And so you're shooting every day for three and a half months\n\n1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:20.760\n in like nine different countries.\n\n1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:25.240\n And so that really was like instrumental to me\n\n1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.680\n becoming a pretty good camera person pretty quickly.\n\n1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:29.240\n And you were doing most of the work yourself?\n\n1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:31.240\n One man, one man band, yeah.\n\n1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:35.440\n The second voyage, I at least had an editor with me.\n\n1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:36.920\n Yeah, but I was shooting everything.\n\n1:29:36.920 --> 1:29:38.800\n Yeah, what's the perfect team?\n\n1:29:38.800 --> 1:29:43.640\n Is it two people for nonfiction asking for a friend?\n\n1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:45.840\n Some kind of interested in some storytelling,\n\n1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:50.040\n not of the level and the sophistication that you're doing,\n\n1:29:50.040 --> 1:29:51.040\n but more.\n\n1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:52.400\n I think you have to allow the story\n\n1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:54.280\n to dictate what the size of the film should be.\n\n1:29:54.280 --> 1:29:55.980\n For these small human rights docs I do,\n\n1:29:55.980 --> 1:29:59.600\n I think two or three, it means you work your butt off,\n\n1:29:59.600 --> 1:30:01.360\n because you're doing everything, right?\n\n1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:03.640\n But it allows you to tell intimate stories\n\n1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:04.560\n and have that access.\n\n1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:08.560\n I'm doing a film this summer that's a scripted piece\n\n1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:10.520\n where we'll probably have 25 crew people.\n\n1:30:10.520 --> 1:30:11.360\n Oh, wow.\n\n1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:14.520\n So it's a completely different endeavor altogether.\n\n1:30:14.520 --> 1:30:18.560\n But doing it yourself, what do you think about that?\n\n1:30:18.560 --> 1:30:21.360\n Even though you have that trillion dollars.\n\n1:30:21.360 --> 1:30:23.040\n Oh, I have that trillion dollars again?\n\n1:30:23.040 --> 1:30:25.160\n Sweet, you can write that check before I leave, right?\n\n1:30:25.160 --> 1:30:26.000\n Yeah, I will.\n\n1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:26.820\n Okay, great.\n\n1:30:26.820 --> 1:30:30.280\n I've never seen a check for that big.\n\n1:30:30.280 --> 1:30:31.120\n It's gonna be interesting.\n\n1:30:31.120 --> 1:30:31.960\n How many zeros is that?\n\n1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:36.160\n I write them so often, I've lost track.\n\n1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:38.280\n Or the United States government sure as heck\n\n1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:39.360\n writes them often.\n\n1:30:39.360 --> 1:30:42.240\n Okay, anyway, I mean, is there an argument\n\n1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:44.840\n can you steel man the case for a single person?\n\n1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:49.320\n Not for me, not for me, and here's why.\n\n1:30:53.640 --> 1:30:58.640\n What I've found is that by being a team of two filming\n\n1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:03.880\n with a field producer, by two people filming,\n\n1:31:05.600 --> 1:31:10.440\n it allows us to double our footage first off, right?\n\n1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:13.240\n So we have twice as much footage in the time\n\n1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:14.980\n we're filming to come back with as opposed\n\n1:31:14.980 --> 1:31:15.820\n to one person filming.\n\n1:31:15.820 --> 1:31:18.360\n So you're each manning a camera?\n\n1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:19.840\n Yeah, constantly.\n\n1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:22.800\n And how much, sorry to keep interrupting,\n\n1:31:22.800 --> 1:31:25.240\n how much interaction and interplay there is?\n\n1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:28.160\n Sometimes the director of photography is in another room\n\n1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:30.020\n filming a different scene, if it makes sense.\n\n1:31:30.020 --> 1:31:32.760\n Sometimes we're cross shooting in the same room, right?\n\n1:31:32.760 --> 1:31:35.400\n Just depends on the needs of the moment.\n\n1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:38.040\n So we come back with double the footage is one thing.\n\n1:31:38.040 --> 1:31:40.480\n But as a director, so that's, you know,\n\n1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:45.240\n given how access is sometimes shaped by the events\n\n1:31:45.240 --> 1:31:47.800\n so that we can only, something, you know,\n\n1:31:47.800 --> 1:31:49.680\n in Lifeboat, for example, you know,\n\n1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:52.880\n a rescue operation may only happen three days, right?\n\n1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.000\n So you want as much footage of that as you can.\n\n1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:57.360\n But the other piece of it that's really critical for me,\n\n1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:00.360\n I found is that by having another human being\n\n1:32:00.360 --> 1:32:02.760\n I'm filming with, who I'm co shooting with,\n\n1:32:02.760 --> 1:32:05.860\n it frees me up as a director to not always\n\n1:32:05.860 --> 1:32:07.480\n have to be shooting either.\n\n1:32:07.480 --> 1:32:11.560\n I can do all the other work to build relationships, right?\n\n1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:14.040\n To have side conversations with people,\n\n1:32:14.040 --> 1:32:18.680\n to sort out the right way to tell a story, right?\n\n1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:21.600\n Or to transfer footage, knowing that the director\n\n1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:23.360\n of photography is still filming during all that.\n\n1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:26.460\n So it frees me up to think of as a director\n\n1:32:26.460 --> 1:32:29.960\n rather than just an image acquirer.\n\n1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:32.440\n Yeah, cause there's also, I don't know how distracting it is.\n\n1:32:32.440 --> 1:32:35.640\n You've obviously done it for years, but setting stuff up,\n\n1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:40.640\n it preoccupies your mind.\n\n1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:42.480\n Like pressing the record button,\n\n1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:43.960\n and like framing stuff and all that,\n\n1:32:43.960 --> 1:32:46.440\n that still takes up some part of your mind\n\n1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:48.240\n where you can't think freely.\n\n1:32:48.240 --> 1:32:49.480\n That's my choice, right?\n\n1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:51.040\n That's how I work best.\n\n1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:53.040\n That said, the caveat there would be\n\n1:32:53.040 --> 1:32:55.000\n that's not the only way to do it, obviously, right?\n\n1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.960\n Like one of my favorite documentaries of all time\n\n1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:03.920\n is a documentary called A Woman Captured, shot in Hungary,\n\n1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:07.120\n by a single filmmaker with a single camera\n\n1:33:07.120 --> 1:33:09.480\n with a single lens, right?\n\n1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:12.160\n And it's brilliant, and powerful,\n\n1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:16.080\n and moving, and interventional.\n\n1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:19.320\n It's incredible filmmaking, and it was a single human being\n\n1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:23.480\n who created that film with a collaborator or subject.\n\n1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.800\n So it can be done, it's just not how I work best.\n\n1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:29.980\n Yeah, how much personally would the other person,\n\n1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:34.180\n how important is the relationship with them\n\n1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:36.360\n outside of the filming?\n\n1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:37.200\n Like.\n\n1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:38.020\n With the director of photography?\n\n1:33:38.020 --> 1:33:39.620\n The director of photography, say.\n\n1:33:39.620 --> 1:33:44.500\n Like, how much drinking, and if you don't drink,\n\n1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:46.060\n whatever the equivalent of that is,\n\n1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:47.580\n do you have to do together?\n\n1:33:47.580 --> 1:33:48.940\n How much soul searching?\n\n1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:52.460\n Or is it more like two surgeons getting together?\n\n1:33:52.460 --> 1:33:55.940\n Is it surgeons, or is it a jazz band?\n\n1:33:55.940 --> 1:33:57.980\n Well, it could be either, right?\n\n1:33:57.980 --> 1:33:59.240\n Hopefully not at the same time, though,\n\n1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:00.980\n because I don't think surgeons and jazz bands\n\n1:34:00.980 --> 1:34:02.580\n go well together, probably.\n\n1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:05.740\n They're both good with fingers, I suppose.\n\n1:34:05.740 --> 1:34:08.220\n Exactly, but I'd rather maybe not play jazz\n\n1:34:08.220 --> 1:34:09.860\n while they operate on me.\n\n1:34:09.860 --> 1:34:14.860\n But I think, for me, I think there are moments of both,\n\n1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:17.580\n but usually not at the same time, right?\n\n1:34:17.580 --> 1:34:20.860\n There are surgical moments where the moment is so pressing,\n\n1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:25.000\n you really have to be that task driven, right?\n\n1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.100\n To capture as thoroughly as possible\n\n1:34:27.100 --> 1:34:29.300\n whatever's unfolding, right?\n\n1:34:29.300 --> 1:34:30.380\n But I think there's other times\n\n1:34:30.380 --> 1:34:32.880\n where you do improvise like jazz, right?\n\n1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:35.940\n And where you have a lot of choices ahead of you,\n\n1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:38.780\n and you're doing maybe a dance\n\n1:34:38.780 --> 1:34:41.060\n with the other camera person, right?\n\n1:34:41.060 --> 1:34:43.220\n In order to capture a scene as creatively\n\n1:34:43.220 --> 1:34:47.420\n and fully as possible during a fixed duration.\n\n1:34:47.420 --> 1:34:51.340\n How much, you said shaping, because it is nonfiction.\n\n1:34:51.340 --> 1:34:53.380\n But I feel like there's so many ways\n\n1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:55.420\n to tell the same nonfiction,\n\n1:34:55.420 --> 1:34:57.820\n that is bordering on fiction.\n\n1:34:57.820 --> 1:34:58.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:34:58.660 --> 1:35:01.100\n Well, it's storytelling.\n\n1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:08.060\n And how much shaping do you see yourself as doing?\n\n1:35:08.820 --> 1:35:10.300\n Like how important is your role?\n\n1:35:10.300 --> 1:35:11.640\n How you tell the story?\n\n1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:16.460\n I suppose the question I'm asking is,\n\n1:35:16.460 --> 1:35:18.660\n how many ways can you really screw this up?\n\n1:35:20.420 --> 1:35:21.980\n Every day you can screw it up.\n\n1:35:22.860 --> 1:35:24.780\n I mean, that's really the,\n\n1:35:24.780 --> 1:35:25.980\n I think what you're asking about\n\n1:35:25.980 --> 1:35:29.540\n is really the ethos of documentary filmmaking, right?\n\n1:35:29.540 --> 1:35:32.580\n I allow a lot of things to guide my choices.\n\n1:35:34.100 --> 1:35:38.100\n One of them being, am I being fair, right?\n\n1:35:38.100 --> 1:35:43.100\n Not balanced, but am I being fair to what I'm witnessing?\n\n1:35:43.460 --> 1:35:46.420\n Does the camera capturing in a fair way\n\n1:35:46.420 --> 1:35:48.580\n the truth of the reality?\n\n1:35:48.580 --> 1:35:49.420\n Some fundamental truth of it.\n\n1:35:49.420 --> 1:35:51.620\n And it also speaks to consent, right?\n\n1:35:51.620 --> 1:35:53.900\n Am I being fair in a sense of consent?\n\n1:35:53.900 --> 1:35:56.460\n Do I have active consent in this moment, right?\n\n1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:58.620\n Regardless of whether I have a signed piece of paper.\n\n1:35:58.620 --> 1:36:00.300\n I always find some way to document it,\n\n1:36:00.300 --> 1:36:02.420\n whether it's just direct address to camera\n\n1:36:02.420 --> 1:36:05.460\n or a translated release.\n\n1:36:05.460 --> 1:36:07.740\n So there's, actually that's an interesting little,\n\n1:36:07.740 --> 1:36:10.620\n so they say something to the camera that they consent\n\n1:36:10.620 --> 1:36:12.060\n or they sign the thing.\n\n1:36:12.060 --> 1:36:16.740\n Yeah, so for example, the large broadcast companies\n\n1:36:16.740 --> 1:36:18.300\n have this formalized process\n\n1:36:18.300 --> 1:36:21.580\n where they present a piece of paper, right?\n\n1:36:21.580 --> 1:36:25.180\n And the subject reads it and they sign it\n\n1:36:25.180 --> 1:36:28.860\n and then you have permission and that's irrevocable, right?\n\n1:36:28.860 --> 1:36:30.820\n So it'll hold up in court.\n\n1:36:30.820 --> 1:36:32.820\n That's not how I operate, right?\n\n1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:37.820\n And so it's just, for example, that doesn't work\n\n1:36:38.340 --> 1:36:39.700\n if someone's illiterate\n\n1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:42.020\n and can't read that piece of paper, right?\n\n1:36:42.020 --> 1:36:44.300\n What if they don't know how to sign their name, right?\n\n1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:46.300\n So instead you have to have a conversation,\n\n1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:49.420\n ask questions, have them ask questions,\n\n1:36:49.420 --> 1:36:51.580\n come to a complete understanding\n\n1:36:51.580 --> 1:36:53.700\n before you even know whether they understand\n\n1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:54.940\n what you're asking, right?\n\n1:36:54.940 --> 1:36:57.220\n And then in that case, if someone's illiterate,\n\n1:36:57.220 --> 1:36:58.860\n then you have that conversation,\n\n1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:00.980\n you just sit down and it takes a long time sometimes,\n\n1:37:00.980 --> 1:37:01.820\n but you have to do it.\n\n1:37:01.820 --> 1:37:04.420\n And then if they still wanna participate\n\n1:37:04.420 --> 1:37:06.540\n and they give you their consent,\n\n1:37:06.540 --> 1:37:08.580\n they can't sign a piece of paper, right?\n\n1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:11.780\n So then you just do in their native language, right?\n\n1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:14.220\n Direct consent to camera in their language.\n\n1:37:14.220 --> 1:37:16.340\n Interesting, but also you're speaking to the consent\n\n1:37:16.340 --> 1:37:19.700\n that's just a human placing trust in you.\n\n1:37:19.700 --> 1:37:20.540\n Yeah.\n\n1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:21.380\n You make a connection like this.\n\n1:37:21.380 --> 1:37:23.220\n That's the most important consent, yeah.\n\n1:37:23.220 --> 1:37:27.980\n I hate papers, I hate papers and lawyers\n\n1:37:28.860 --> 1:37:31.420\n because they, exactly for that reason,\n\n1:37:31.420 --> 1:37:35.220\n yeah, okay, great, but you should be focusing\n\n1:37:35.220 --> 1:37:39.060\n on the human connection that leads to the trust,\n\n1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:41.620\n like real consent and consent day to day,\n\n1:37:41.620 --> 1:37:43.740\n minute to minute, because that can change.\n\n1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:46.980\n Absolutely, and it does change.\n\n1:37:46.980 --> 1:37:49.220\n You mentioned A Woman Captured.\n\n1:37:51.340 --> 1:37:54.100\n I'm sure you can't answer that, but I will force you.\n\n1:37:54.100 --> 1:37:58.340\n What are the top three documentaries of all time,\n\n1:37:58.340 --> 1:38:00.140\n short or feature length?\n\n1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.180\n Oh boy.\n\n1:38:01.180 --> 1:38:04.220\n This is not your opinion, this is objective truth.\n\n1:38:05.780 --> 1:38:09.300\n Maybe top one, what's the greatest?\n\n1:38:09.300 --> 1:38:14.300\n We got, let's see, March of the Penguins.\n\n1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:15.860\n That's probably number one for me.\n\n1:38:15.860 --> 1:38:16.700\n Really?\n\n1:38:16.700 --> 1:38:17.740\n No, I'm just kidding, I don't know.\n\n1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:22.740\n I do seem to, the metaphor of penguins\n\n1:38:23.180 --> 1:38:28.180\n huddling together in hard, cold,\n\n1:38:28.820 --> 1:38:32.460\n like in the harsh conditions of nature,\n\n1:38:32.460 --> 1:38:34.940\n that's something that's kind of beautiful.\n\n1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:37.140\n I don't love all nature documentaries,\n\n1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:40.380\n but something about March of the Penguins.\n\n1:38:40.380 --> 1:38:42.580\n I think Morgan Freeman.\n\n1:38:42.580 --> 1:38:43.500\n Yeah, he narrated it.\n\n1:38:43.500 --> 1:38:45.180\n Narrates it, so maybe everything,\n\n1:38:45.180 --> 1:38:47.820\n just any documentary with Morgan Freeman,\n\n1:38:47.820 --> 1:38:49.180\n I'm a sucker for that.\n\n1:38:50.300 --> 1:38:54.180\n Warner, Herzog, The Life and the Taiga, The Simple People.\n\n1:38:54.180 --> 1:38:56.980\n I love Grizzly Man, I love Grizzly Man.\n\n1:38:56.980 --> 1:38:59.020\n I think that's one of his best works.\n\n1:38:59.020 --> 1:39:03.180\n Yes, I think that's Joe Rogan's favorite documentary.\n\n1:39:04.340 --> 1:39:06.860\n It's both comedy and, I mean it's.\n\n1:39:06.860 --> 1:39:07.700\n Tragic comedy.\n\n1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:09.900\n Tragic comedy, yeah.\n\n1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:11.740\n Is there something that stands out to you,\n\n1:39:11.740 --> 1:39:13.900\n I mean I'm joking about best,\n\n1:39:13.900 --> 1:39:15.740\n something that was impactful to you?\n\n1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:16.660\n Just to put it out there,\n\n1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.060\n I don't think there's any way to say\n\n1:39:19.060 --> 1:39:22.420\n that they're objectively the best three documentaries\n\n1:39:22.420 --> 1:39:23.660\n of all time, but for me,\n\n1:39:23.660 --> 1:39:25.660\n and you may find this interesting given your background,\n\n1:39:25.660 --> 1:39:30.660\n is that I think my top three are all\n\n1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:35.540\n from the Eastern Bloc, actually.\n\n1:39:35.540 --> 1:39:40.540\n So Aquarella by Viktor Kosokovsky is one of my favorite,\n\n1:39:41.980 --> 1:39:43.780\n and it's a couple years old now,\n\n1:39:43.780 --> 1:39:47.420\n which is sort of a meditation on the place water has\n\n1:39:47.420 --> 1:39:49.100\n on our planet and on our lives.\n\n1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:53.340\n I think A Woman Captured that I mentioned,\n\n1:39:53.340 --> 1:39:54.580\n which was shot in Hungary.\n\n1:39:54.580 --> 1:39:56.220\n Is it a feature length one?\n\n1:39:56.220 --> 1:39:58.500\n Both are feature lengths, yeah.\n\n1:39:58.500 --> 1:40:00.540\n It is just brilliant,\n\n1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:05.340\n and it I think has yet to find distribution here in the U.S.\n\n1:40:05.340 --> 1:40:09.540\n But it's the perfect example of what they call verite,\n\n1:40:09.540 --> 1:40:13.380\n or direct nonfiction filmmaking.\n\n1:40:13.380 --> 1:40:15.620\n A European woman, this is the synopsis,\n\n1:40:15.620 --> 1:40:17.660\n a European woman has been kept by a family\n\n1:40:17.660 --> 1:40:20.140\n as a domestic slave for 10 years,\n\n1:40:20.140 --> 1:40:23.580\n drawing courage from the filmmaker's presence.\n\n1:40:23.580 --> 1:40:27.300\n She decides to escape the unbearable oppression\n\n1:40:27.300 --> 1:40:28.620\n and become a free person.\n\n1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:32.540\n Wow, so the filmmaker is part of the story.\n\n1:40:32.540 --> 1:40:34.740\n Part of the story, it didn't start that way,\n\n1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:36.340\n but during the course of the story,\n\n1:40:36.340 --> 1:40:39.540\n the filmmaker comes to understand\n\n1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:41.940\n that this is actually modern day slavery.\n\n1:40:41.940 --> 1:40:45.380\n And rather than just allow it to be,\n\n1:40:45.380 --> 1:40:48.420\n actually enables and assists this woman\n\n1:40:48.420 --> 1:40:51.020\n to free herself from slavery and become a free woman.\n\n1:40:51.020 --> 1:40:52.660\n I wonder, sorry, on a small tangent\n\n1:40:52.660 --> 1:40:53.700\n before we get to number three,\n\n1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:55.740\n like Icarus is interesting too.\n\n1:40:57.060 --> 1:41:00.980\n How often do you become part of the story,\n\n1:41:00.980 --> 1:41:04.740\n or the story is different because of your presence?\n\n1:41:06.060 --> 1:41:10.140\n Like you changed the tide of history.\n\n1:41:10.140 --> 1:41:12.740\n Yeah, well, back to just like one person at a time\n\n1:41:12.740 --> 1:41:13.580\n that we keep talking,\n\n1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:16.980\n we keep coming back to that theme on some level.\n\n1:41:16.980 --> 1:41:19.180\n So this could tie in interesting\n\n1:41:19.180 --> 1:41:21.180\n to one of my favorite films actually.\n\n1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:24.780\n So the last two films that I would mention\n\n1:41:24.780 --> 1:41:26.660\n for my top four list would be,\n\n1:41:26.660 --> 1:41:28.300\n the third Eastern Bloc one\n\n1:41:28.300 --> 1:41:31.940\n would be a film called Immortal in 2019,\n\n1:41:31.940 --> 1:41:34.500\n which was shot in Russia by a Russian woman\n\n1:41:35.460 --> 1:41:39.380\n that sort of examines the place of the state\n\n1:41:41.620 --> 1:41:46.020\n in shaping individuals to be vehicles for the state.\n\n1:41:46.020 --> 1:41:47.220\n I mean, that's my own synopsis,\n\n1:41:47.220 --> 1:41:49.100\n but that's one of my takeaways\n\n1:41:49.100 --> 1:41:52.180\n from the brilliant 60 minute doc or so.\n\n1:41:52.180 --> 1:41:57.180\n Again, Russian filmmaking is really quite good and powerful.\n\n1:41:57.180 --> 1:41:59.900\n The fourth one would be a Frederick Wiseman film,\n\n1:41:59.900 --> 1:42:04.900\n Titicate Follies, which was filmed in the US decades ago,\n\n1:42:04.900 --> 1:42:09.220\n inside basically the bowels of an insane asylum\n\n1:42:09.220 --> 1:42:11.180\n or a mental health institution.\n\n1:42:11.180 --> 1:42:16.180\n And I bring up Wiseman because he is really the godfather,\n\n1:42:17.420 --> 1:42:21.900\n so to speak, of direct cinema or cinema verite.\n\n1:42:21.900 --> 1:42:25.260\n And when early in my career,\n\n1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:29.700\n I really believed in what he expressed\n\n1:42:29.700 --> 1:42:32.940\n as the place of the verite filmmaker,\n\n1:42:32.940 --> 1:42:36.380\n which is simply fly on the wall,\n\n1:42:36.380 --> 1:42:41.140\n which is only observational in nature, right?\n\n1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:44.300\n And I believe that that's how I should be\n\n1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:45.620\n as a nonfiction filmmaker,\n\n1:42:45.620 --> 1:42:48.860\n that I was there only to bear witness, to observe,\n\n1:42:48.860 --> 1:42:52.340\n and not to intervene in any way, shape, or form.\n\n1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:56.980\n And that was the sort of foundation\n\n1:42:56.980 --> 1:43:00.060\n for how I operated for many, many years.\n\n1:43:00.060 --> 1:43:01.860\n And then some things happened.\n\n1:43:01.860 --> 1:43:06.860\n So one of those things that happened was I filmed Lifeboat.\n\n1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:10.980\n And during the course of filming Lifeboat,\n\n1:43:10.980 --> 1:43:15.300\n which covered rescue operations in the Mediterranean\n\n1:43:15.300 --> 1:43:16.580\n off the coast of Libya,\n\n1:43:16.580 --> 1:43:21.580\n in the first three days of that rescue mission,\n\n1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:27.140\n we came upon over 3,000 people, asylum seekers,\n\n1:43:27.140 --> 1:43:29.820\n floating in flimsy rafts in the water.\n\n1:43:30.700 --> 1:43:35.340\n And we were on the Zodiacs and we were filming.\n\n1:43:35.340 --> 1:43:39.220\n And within the first couple hours,\n\n1:43:39.220 --> 1:43:44.220\n we would come up to these rafts and these boats\n\n1:43:44.220 --> 1:43:46.540\n that were in really dire shape,\n\n1:43:46.540 --> 1:43:49.900\n and people would be pushed off, and people would jump off,\n\n1:43:49.900 --> 1:43:52.140\n and people would fall into the water,\n\n1:43:52.140 --> 1:43:56.660\n and some of them couldn't swim.\n\n1:43:57.660 --> 1:44:00.260\n And so we found ourselves in this moment\n\n1:44:00.260 --> 1:44:02.060\n where we had a choice.\n\n1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:05.300\n We could film someone drown in front of us,\n\n1:44:05.300 --> 1:44:06.980\n or we could put our cameras down\n\n1:44:06.980 --> 1:44:08.740\n and pull them out of the water.\n\n1:44:08.740 --> 1:44:10.540\n And so that's what we did.\n\n1:44:10.540 --> 1:44:13.860\n We put our cameras in the bottom of the water,\n\n1:44:13.860 --> 1:44:14.820\n bottom of the Zodiac,\n\n1:44:14.820 --> 1:44:17.420\n and just started pulling people out of the water.\n\n1:44:17.420 --> 1:44:22.420\n And if I was Wiseman, according to his paradigm,\n\n1:44:24.100 --> 1:44:25.980\n then we should have just filmed.\n\n1:44:25.980 --> 1:44:30.580\n And I didn't anticipate that moment beforehand.\n\n1:44:30.580 --> 1:44:32.420\n I had no sort of foreknowledge\n\n1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:34.340\n that I was gonna find myself faced\n\n1:44:34.340 --> 1:44:38.300\n with that dilemma of the moment as a documentarian.\n\n1:44:38.300 --> 1:44:40.020\n But there was no question in my mind\n\n1:44:40.020 --> 1:44:41.340\n that I had to put my camera down\n\n1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:43.860\n and pull that fellow human being out of the water.\n\n1:44:43.860 --> 1:44:45.460\n And I don't regret it at all.\n\n1:44:45.460 --> 1:44:46.900\n So I've come to a different place.\n\n1:44:46.900 --> 1:44:49.820\n I've evolved to what I believe for the kind of film\n\n1:44:49.820 --> 1:44:52.860\n that I do is more appropriate.\n\n1:44:52.860 --> 1:44:56.740\n I can go to sleep at night knowing that,\n\n1:44:56.740 --> 1:44:58.460\n regardless of how the film would have been different\n\n1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:00.780\n if I hadn't made that choice,\n\n1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:02.820\n I made the right choice as a human being.\n\n1:45:02.820 --> 1:45:05.420\n So I think of it as being a human being first\n\n1:45:05.420 --> 1:45:08.340\n and a filmmaker second in moments like that.\n\n1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:11.780\n That's beautifully put, but I also think\n\n1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:15.220\n you could be a human being in small ways too,\n\n1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:19.140\n like silly ways, and put a little bit of yourself\n\n1:45:19.140 --> 1:45:20.940\n in documentaries.\n\n1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:23.060\n I tend to see that as really beautiful.\n\n1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:26.340\n Like the meta piece of it?\n\n1:45:26.340 --> 1:45:31.020\n Yeah, just put yourself into the movie a little bit.\n\n1:45:31.020 --> 1:45:35.220\n Because break that third, fourth, whatever the wall is,\n\n1:45:35.220 --> 1:45:38.820\n is realize that there's a human behind the camera too.\n\n1:45:38.820 --> 1:45:41.700\n For some reason, me as a fan, as a viewer,\n\n1:45:41.700 --> 1:45:42.900\n that's enjoyable too.\n\n1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:45.780\n I think there's a real authenticity there\n\n1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:49.180\n behind the story, especially with these hard stories\n\n1:45:49.180 --> 1:45:53.060\n that you're doing that there's a human being struggling to.\n\n1:45:53.060 --> 1:45:56.420\n Like observing the suffering\n\n1:45:57.420 --> 1:46:02.420\n and having to bear the burden\n\n1:46:02.660 --> 1:46:05.140\n that this kind of suffering exists in the world\n\n1:46:05.140 --> 1:46:09.060\n and you're behind that camera living that struggle.\n\n1:46:09.060 --> 1:46:12.420\n And there's small ways to show yourself in that way.\n\n1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:16.500\n As you know, I don't do that in a big way.\n\n1:46:16.500 --> 1:46:18.940\n But I actually, there are subtle moments\n\n1:46:18.940 --> 1:46:23.180\n where I allow that presence to live just for a second.\n\n1:46:23.180 --> 1:46:26.580\n Like I hate belly button docs, that's what I call them.\n\n1:46:26.580 --> 1:46:27.420\n I don't know.\n\n1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:28.260\n What's a belly button doc?\n\n1:46:28.260 --> 1:46:30.420\n A belly button doc is navel gazing, right?\n\n1:46:30.420 --> 1:46:33.900\n Where it's sort of a narcissistic filmmaking\n\n1:46:33.900 --> 1:46:38.380\n where someone just studies their own place in the world.\n\n1:46:38.380 --> 1:46:39.220\n Right, I think.\n\n1:46:39.220 --> 1:46:40.060\n I see, yeah.\n\n1:46:40.060 --> 1:46:44.740\n I think my, I'm more concerned\n\n1:46:44.740 --> 1:46:48.980\n with how I can intervene, right?\n\n1:46:48.980 --> 1:46:52.580\n Yeah, well, you're trying to really deeply empathize.\n\n1:46:52.580 --> 1:46:53.420\n Yeah.\n\n1:46:53.420 --> 1:46:55.980\n So like, if you do empathize, who am I?\n\n1:46:55.980 --> 1:46:57.980\n I don't wanna center myself in these stories.\n\n1:46:57.980 --> 1:46:59.380\n It's not about me, right?\n\n1:46:59.380 --> 1:47:01.100\n I am so unimportant.\n\n1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:03.660\n What is important is what's happening,\n\n1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:06.300\n what's unfolding in the world that we need to act upon.\n\n1:47:06.300 --> 1:47:09.180\n And I think it's selfish and narcissistic\n\n1:47:09.180 --> 1:47:13.380\n to push myself into these stories unnecessarily.\n\n1:47:13.380 --> 1:47:16.180\n Now that said, I think there is some small value\n\n1:47:16.180 --> 1:47:18.900\n in what you're saying just to remind viewers\n\n1:47:18.900 --> 1:47:21.020\n that there's obviously a filmmaker at play.\n\n1:47:21.020 --> 1:47:22.980\n So sometimes the way that I do that\n\n1:47:22.980 --> 1:47:25.700\n is just like through a question on camera.\n\n1:47:25.700 --> 1:47:28.660\n I'd allow the audio to live of a question\n\n1:47:28.660 --> 1:47:31.140\n or during a conversation I'm having with someone\n\n1:47:31.140 --> 1:47:34.820\n so they can just hear how it's posed, for example, right?\n\n1:47:34.820 --> 1:47:36.020\n And to me, that's enough.\n\n1:47:37.180 --> 1:47:38.020\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:38.020 --> 1:47:43.020\n I do like moments when people recognize that you exist.\n\n1:47:43.620 --> 1:47:47.220\n They look at the filmmaker past the camera\n\n1:47:47.220 --> 1:47:49.620\n and yes, you ask the question in an interview\n\n1:47:49.620 --> 1:47:52.540\n or something like that and they respond to that.\n\n1:47:52.540 --> 1:47:53.660\n Yeah.\n\n1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:57.140\n Like they respond to this like new perturbation\n\n1:47:57.140 --> 1:47:59.980\n into their reality that was created by this other human.\n\n1:47:59.980 --> 1:48:00.820\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:00.820 --> 1:48:02.820\n I especially like when those questions\n\n1:48:02.820 --> 1:48:07.620\n or those perturbations are like a little bit absurd\n\n1:48:07.620 --> 1:48:11.260\n and like add something very novel to their situation\n\n1:48:11.260 --> 1:48:14.220\n and that novelty reveals something about them.\n\n1:48:15.260 --> 1:48:18.260\n So as opposed to capturing the day to day reality\n\n1:48:18.260 --> 1:48:21.620\n of their life, you do that plus the perturbations\n\n1:48:21.620 --> 1:48:23.020\n of like something novel.\n\n1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:24.340\n Yeah.\n\n1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:26.860\n But of course, there's all kinds of ways to do this.\n\n1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:29.900\n Let me, what was number five, by the way?\n\n1:48:29.900 --> 1:48:31.020\n I only gave you four.\n\n1:48:31.020 --> 1:48:31.860\n You just.\n\n1:48:31.860 --> 1:48:33.500\n I'm just gonna stay at four.\n\n1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:35.180\n There's a short doc I like, I mentioned,\n\n1:48:35.180 --> 1:48:38.500\n they're called The Toxic Pigs of Fukushima.\n\n1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:39.500\n I know, I know.\n\n1:48:39.500 --> 1:48:40.340\n I apologize.\n\n1:48:40.340 --> 1:48:41.180\n I know, I know.\n\n1:48:41.180 --> 1:48:42.220\n It's dark.\n\n1:48:42.220 --> 1:48:43.060\n It's a great title though, right?\n\n1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:43.900\n It's a great title.\n\n1:48:43.900 --> 1:48:45.300\n Yeah, great title.\n\n1:48:45.300 --> 1:48:47.780\n No one's seen it, but it's great.\n\n1:48:47.780 --> 1:48:49.380\n It says what it sounds like.\n\n1:48:49.380 --> 1:48:51.380\n Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like,\n\n1:48:51.380 --> 1:48:53.740\n but really brilliantly executed.\n\n1:48:55.140 --> 1:48:56.420\n Well, let me ask you about Lifeboat\n\n1:48:56.420 --> 1:49:01.300\n because it's extremely, I don't.\n\n1:49:04.180 --> 1:49:07.740\n It's a really moving idea.\n\n1:49:07.740 --> 1:49:10.540\n Just the fact that this exists in the world,\n\n1:49:10.540 --> 1:49:14.540\n that there's, as a metaphor, as a reality,\n\n1:49:14.540 --> 1:49:18.740\n that there is a set of people trying to flee desperately.\n\n1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:20.220\n It's the desperation of it.\n\n1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:25.020\n And now with these refugees, the desperation of that,\n\n1:49:25.020 --> 1:49:28.340\n of trying to escape towards a world\n\n1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:32.460\n that's full of mystery, uncertainty, doubt,\n\n1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:34.220\n could be hopeless at times,\n\n1:49:34.220 --> 1:49:38.060\n and you're willing to do a lot for your own survival\n\n1:49:38.060 --> 1:49:39.740\n and for the survival of your family\n\n1:49:39.740 --> 1:49:40.740\n and all those kinds of things.\n\n1:49:40.740 --> 1:49:42.820\n That's kind of the human spirit,\n\n1:49:42.820 --> 1:49:47.420\n and you just capture it in Lifeboat.\n\n1:49:47.420 --> 1:49:51.020\n Can you tell me the story behind this film\n\n1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:52.540\n as you started to already tell?\n\n1:49:52.540 --> 1:49:55.460\n Can you tell me what is it about?\n\n1:49:56.460 --> 1:50:01.460\n So Lifeboat really seeks to sort of lift up\n\n1:50:03.460 --> 1:50:08.460\n and showcase the asylum seeker crisis in the Mediterranean\n\n1:50:10.060 --> 1:50:15.140\n when it was at its height in 2016.\n\n1:50:15.140 --> 1:50:18.980\n And it came to be for many reasons,\n\n1:50:18.980 --> 1:50:23.700\n but one of those reasons is colleagues\n\n1:50:23.700 --> 1:50:26.540\n in the NGO community really shared with me\n\n1:50:26.540 --> 1:50:29.700\n that when the borders between Greece and Turkey\n\n1:50:29.700 --> 1:50:34.700\n were shut down, that the flow of Syrian asylum seekers\n\n1:50:35.620 --> 1:50:39.620\n that was initially going across from Turkey to Greece\n\n1:50:39.620 --> 1:50:42.540\n was going to shift westward across the Mediterranean.\n\n1:50:42.540 --> 1:50:43.860\n So I started to research that\n\n1:50:43.860 --> 1:50:46.660\n and discovered that was exactly the case,\n\n1:50:46.660 --> 1:50:49.420\n and then further stumbled upon the fact\n\n1:50:49.420 --> 1:50:54.340\n that nation states hadn't really stepped up to address it\n\n1:50:54.340 --> 1:50:57.420\n and that there were hundreds of asylum seekers\n\n1:50:57.420 --> 1:50:59.380\n often drowning in these flimsy crafts\n\n1:50:59.380 --> 1:51:01.780\n that were pushed off from the shores of Libya\n\n1:51:01.780 --> 1:51:06.060\n because the EU wasn't doing its duty\n\n1:51:06.060 --> 1:51:09.540\n to patrol those waters from a humanitarian standpoint.\n\n1:51:09.540 --> 1:51:11.860\n And so the net result of that was that\n\n1:51:11.860 --> 1:51:16.860\n this whole sort of like humanitarian community sprung up\n\n1:51:16.940 --> 1:51:18.820\n and it was civil society based\n\n1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:22.100\n that tried to meet the needs of those asylum seekers\n\n1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:25.500\n to just ensure that fellow human beings\n\n1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:27.380\n weren't drowning, simply put.\n\n1:51:27.380 --> 1:51:30.980\n And one of those was the small little NGO called Sea Watch,\n\n1:51:30.980 --> 1:51:33.300\n which when they discovered what was happening,\n\n1:51:33.300 --> 1:51:38.300\n just cobbled together a coalition of volunteers,\n\n1:51:38.740 --> 1:51:41.740\n bought a research vessel, retrofitted it,\n\n1:51:41.740 --> 1:51:44.380\n and motored down off the coast of Libya\n\n1:51:44.380 --> 1:51:45.980\n to start pulling people out of the water.\n\n1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:48.700\n And again, I found that inspiring, right?\n\n1:51:48.700 --> 1:51:52.300\n I found that inspiring that this group of volunteers\n\n1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:56.860\n was doing something that our leaders wouldn't, right?\n\n1:51:56.860 --> 1:51:59.500\n And it was something as basic and simple\n\n1:51:59.500 --> 1:52:01.460\n as saving human beings.\n\n1:52:03.060 --> 1:52:06.220\n And I thought there was an inspiring story there.\n\n1:52:06.220 --> 1:52:08.380\n And as it turned out, there was.\n\n1:52:08.380 --> 1:52:11.180\n Have you ever saved someone's life\n\n1:52:13.620 --> 1:52:17.580\n as part of making these documentaries directly?\n\n1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:22.100\n And directly, I think you probably have countless lives,\n\n1:52:22.100 --> 1:52:25.020\n but directly, were you put in that position?\n\n1:52:25.020 --> 1:52:29.420\n I don't wanna, I mean, I certainly poured people\n\n1:52:29.420 --> 1:52:33.540\n out of the water who couldn't swim, I did that.\n\n1:52:33.540 --> 1:52:35.700\n And that's again, speaking to the basic humanity,\n\n1:52:35.700 --> 1:52:39.460\n put down the camera and help, yeah.\n\n1:52:40.580 --> 1:52:43.540\n So this is people coming from Libya,\n\n1:52:43.540 --> 1:52:46.260\n trying to make it across the Mediterranean Sea\n\n1:52:46.260 --> 1:52:48.900\n on a crappy, tiny boat.\n\n1:52:48.900 --> 1:52:51.420\n From a filmmaker perspective, how do you film that?\n\n1:52:51.420 --> 1:52:55.900\n Was there decisions to capture the desperation?\n\n1:52:55.900 --> 1:53:00.900\n Well, we were going back to this idea of access\n\n1:53:01.180 --> 1:53:03.420\n and how that's so fundamental to my approach.\n\n1:53:03.420 --> 1:53:08.420\n And we were bound by the strictures of the rescue operation\n\n1:53:10.060 --> 1:53:12.900\n on this Sea Watch vessel, which was 30 meters long.\n\n1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:16.740\n And we were two of a crew of 15, right?\n\n1:53:16.740 --> 1:53:18.700\n So we had to multitask all the time\n\n1:53:18.700 --> 1:53:21.740\n because the only reason we were on that boat\n\n1:53:21.740 --> 1:53:25.460\n was by agreeing that if needed,\n\n1:53:25.460 --> 1:53:27.740\n we would do whatever necessary, right?\n\n1:53:27.740 --> 1:53:30.700\n To help, right?\n\n1:53:30.700 --> 1:53:33.140\n And so it was very active on multiple levels\n\n1:53:33.140 --> 1:53:38.020\n and we were making decisions each and every day\n\n1:53:38.020 --> 1:53:42.220\n that were not only filmmaking and creative decisions,\n\n1:53:42.220 --> 1:53:47.220\n but also decisions about how to live that duality, right?\n\n1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:56.980\n Of being a humanitarian and a filmmaker simultaneously.\n\n1:53:56.980 --> 1:54:01.980\n And the greatest example I can share of that was,\n\n1:54:01.980 --> 1:54:04.500\n or with my director of photography in that project,\n\n1:54:04.500 --> 1:54:08.940\n Kenny Allen, Kenny's a big guy.\n\n1:54:08.940 --> 1:54:11.940\n It's like, he's got like arms like tree trunks.\n\n1:54:11.940 --> 1:54:16.940\n And he, because he was so physically able and strong,\n\n1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:22.740\n the head of mission really tasked him\n\n1:54:22.740 --> 1:54:24.860\n to be on the Zodiacs to pull people out of the water\n\n1:54:24.860 --> 1:54:27.100\n because he could literally with one arm reach down\n\n1:54:27.100 --> 1:54:30.460\n and just oftentimes pull someone out, right?\n\n1:54:30.460 --> 1:54:33.100\n Whereas usually it would take two or three people, right?\n\n1:54:33.100 --> 1:54:37.060\n And so when we were at the height of triage\n\n1:54:37.060 --> 1:54:39.380\n and there were people in the water all over\n\n1:54:39.380 --> 1:54:41.780\n and rafts were sinking,\n\n1:54:41.780 --> 1:54:43.780\n Kenny was out pulling people out of the water.\n\n1:54:43.780 --> 1:54:46.380\n And this went on for like 24 hours, right?\n\n1:54:46.380 --> 1:54:48.380\n And at the end of that first day,\n\n1:54:48.380 --> 1:54:51.260\n I remember like looking over on the deck\n\n1:54:51.260 --> 1:54:54.380\n and seeing Kenny like help people up from the ladders\n\n1:54:54.380 --> 1:54:56.260\n to walk them back, right?\n\n1:54:56.260 --> 1:54:59.780\n And his camera was nowhere to be seen, right?\n\n1:54:59.780 --> 1:55:01.300\n And so I walked over to him\n\n1:55:01.300 --> 1:55:03.740\n and I just grabbed him by the shoulders and said,\n\n1:55:03.740 --> 1:55:06.060\n Kenny, where's your camera?\n\n1:55:07.060 --> 1:55:08.820\n And he didn't know.\n\n1:55:08.820 --> 1:55:11.140\n He had no idea where his camera was, right?\n\n1:55:11.140 --> 1:55:13.220\n And so I just said, Kenny,\n\n1:55:15.340 --> 1:55:17.460\n we're here to do what you're doing,\n\n1:55:19.380 --> 1:55:21.980\n but we're also here to film it, right?\n\n1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:24.260\n To make sure that we document\n\n1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:26.140\n what is unfolding in front of us\n\n1:55:26.140 --> 1:55:28.180\n so that we have a record of it, right?\n\n1:55:28.180 --> 1:55:30.780\n So we can bring it to a larger audience.\n\n1:55:30.780 --> 1:55:32.460\n So you need to go find your camera\n\n1:55:32.460 --> 1:55:34.900\n so we can also document it.\n\n1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:36.500\n And that kind of pulled him out\n\n1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:38.420\n and he went and got his camera and started filming again,\n\n1:55:38.420 --> 1:55:40.940\n but that gives you a sense of sort of this world\n\n1:55:40.940 --> 1:55:43.940\n that we had to live in in order to get the story done.\n\n1:55:43.940 --> 1:55:47.300\n But I think to be a great director of photography,\n\n1:55:47.300 --> 1:55:48.980\n to be a great director,\n\n1:55:48.980 --> 1:55:53.860\n you have to lose yourself like that in the story too.\n\n1:55:53.860 --> 1:55:55.940\n But usually with a camera in your hand, right?\n\n1:55:55.940 --> 1:55:58.100\n But sometimes you forget the camera.\n\n1:55:58.100 --> 1:56:00.620\n I mean, there's a,\n\n1:56:00.620 --> 1:56:05.620\n I feel like if you're obsessed with the camera too much,\n\n1:56:06.220 --> 1:56:08.100\n you can lose the humanity of it.\n\n1:56:08.100 --> 1:56:10.420\n You get obsessed with the film and the story.\n\n1:56:10.420 --> 1:56:11.500\n It can become clinical.\n\n1:56:11.500 --> 1:56:12.420\n Yes, it can become clinical.\n\n1:56:12.420 --> 1:56:15.700\n Absolutely, and it's, you know, yeah, absolutely.\n\n1:56:15.700 --> 1:56:17.020\n And we don't wanna become,\n\n1:56:17.020 --> 1:56:19.420\n I don't wanna become clinical in my film, certainly.\n\n1:56:19.420 --> 1:56:23.500\n Let me ask you a strange and perhaps edgy question.\n\n1:56:23.500 --> 1:56:26.180\n So some filmmakers believe it's justified\n\n1:56:26.180 --> 1:56:30.860\n to break the rules in order to tell a powerful story.\n\n1:56:30.860 --> 1:56:35.860\n Warner Herzog, I read this somewhere,\n\n1:56:36.020 --> 1:56:37.940\n teaches young filmmakers to pick locks\n\n1:56:37.940 --> 1:56:39.620\n and forge documents and so on.\n\n1:56:39.620 --> 1:56:41.460\n Oh, I didn't know that, interesting.\n\n1:56:41.460 --> 1:56:42.540\n What do you think about that?\n\n1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:45.140\n Bending the rules in service of telling a story.\n\n1:56:46.100 --> 1:56:48.300\n You would, of course, never break the law,\n\n1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:54.460\n but is there, does that, just generally speaking,\n\n1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:58.420\n speaking, bending the rules and so on?\n\n1:56:58.420 --> 1:57:02.180\n You know, just to elaborate on this question, perhaps,\n\n1:57:02.180 --> 1:57:04.820\n I'm distinctly aware that there's parts in the world\n\n1:57:04.820 --> 1:57:09.820\n where the rule of law is not, like,\n\n1:57:11.140 --> 1:57:15.260\n enforced as cleanly as it is in the United States,\n\n1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:17.380\n as fairly as it is in the United States,\n\n1:57:17.380 --> 1:57:20.900\n that there's a kind of, there's a lot of bribery,\n\n1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:25.220\n there's a lot of, like, you don't really know to trust,\n\n1:57:25.220 --> 1:57:27.580\n you don't know if you can trust the cops\n\n1:57:27.580 --> 1:57:30.300\n or basically anybody.\n\n1:57:30.300 --> 1:57:34.540\n So, like, the rules are a very hazy kind of concept.\n\n1:57:34.540 --> 1:57:36.540\n And a lot of them, especially, like, it's funny,\n\n1:57:36.540 --> 1:57:38.180\n but authoritarian regimes often have\n\n1:57:38.180 --> 1:57:40.860\n a giant bureaucracy buildup that's full of rules.\n\n1:57:40.860 --> 1:57:43.020\n There's more rules than you know what to deal with,\n\n1:57:43.020 --> 1:57:44.500\n and you can't actually live life\n\n1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:45.940\n unless you break the rules.\n\n1:57:45.940 --> 1:57:49.180\n Anyway, laying that all out on the table,\n\n1:57:49.180 --> 1:57:51.740\n do you ever contend with that,\n\n1:57:53.020 --> 1:57:58.020\n on what are the rules I can break or should break\n\n1:57:58.060 --> 1:58:00.860\n to keep to the spirit of the story?\n\n1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:03.300\n I think you have to ask yourself, are the rules just,\n\n1:58:03.300 --> 1:58:05.100\n and why are they in place, right?\n\n1:58:05.100 --> 1:58:07.380\n So, for example, coming into the airport\n\n1:58:07.380 --> 1:58:10.060\n in southern Yemen, right?\n\n1:58:10.060 --> 1:58:11.900\n If I just tried to walk through the airport\n\n1:58:11.900 --> 1:58:14.140\n with all my equipment, even with all the permissions\n\n1:58:14.140 --> 1:58:18.020\n beforehand, like we had, without having a fixer\n\n1:58:18.020 --> 1:58:20.540\n at the airport beforehand to make sure\n\n1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:23.180\n we didn't go through the standard line, right?\n\n1:58:24.620 --> 1:58:28.260\n We would have been caught up for three hours at least\n\n1:58:28.260 --> 1:58:30.940\n negotiating over our equipment and eventually paying\n\n1:58:30.940 --> 1:58:33.500\n a bribe to get it through, right?\n\n1:58:33.500 --> 1:58:36.660\n That's just reality in a place like Yemen.\n\n1:58:36.660 --> 1:58:39.700\n And so, of course, knowing that, right?\n\n1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:41.460\n Having talked to colleagues who had taken\n\n1:58:41.460 --> 1:58:45.180\n that path previously, I took a different path, right?\n\n1:58:45.180 --> 1:58:48.500\n Where we hire a fixer beforehand to sort it out\n\n1:58:48.500 --> 1:58:50.060\n beforehand, right?\n\n1:58:50.060 --> 1:58:52.260\n Rather than spending three hours of our time\n\n1:58:52.260 --> 1:58:54.260\n and paying a series of bribes, right?\n\n1:58:54.260 --> 1:58:56.980\n Instead, we're going to get it fixed beforehand\n\n1:58:56.980 --> 1:58:59.220\n so that we can walk through a different line\n\n1:58:59.220 --> 1:59:02.180\n and have no one look at any of our equipment.\n\n1:59:02.180 --> 1:59:06.420\n That's a pretty good trade off in my mind.\n\n1:59:06.420 --> 1:59:09.300\n What about security when you're traveling in these places?\n\n1:59:09.300 --> 1:59:10.820\n Do you ever have bodyguards?\n\n1:59:12.820 --> 1:59:14.620\n Well, several questions around that.\n\n1:59:14.620 --> 1:59:16.820\n Are you ever afraid for your life\n\n1:59:16.820 --> 1:59:18.700\n when you're filming in a war zone?\n\n1:59:19.620 --> 1:59:24.620\n Is there any way to lessen the probability of death?\n\n1:59:27.180 --> 1:59:28.420\n I don't have a death wish.\n\n1:59:28.420 --> 1:59:32.020\n I try to mitigate risk however I can, however I can.\n\n1:59:32.020 --> 1:59:35.140\n But one of the ways I can't do it in a conflict zone\n\n1:59:35.140 --> 1:59:37.500\n is by having armed security with me.\n\n1:59:37.500 --> 1:59:39.300\n And the reason for that is because,\n\n1:59:39.300 --> 1:59:41.740\n especially in a place like Yemen, right?\n\n1:59:41.740 --> 1:59:44.300\n If you have armed security, you become a target\n\n1:59:44.300 --> 1:59:47.980\n in a way that if you're operating under sort of\n\n1:59:47.980 --> 1:59:52.020\n the auspices of international humanitarian law,\n\n1:59:52.020 --> 1:59:53.580\n I actually have more protection.\n\n1:59:53.580 --> 1:59:55.460\n So I don't bring security.\n\n1:59:55.460 --> 1:59:58.740\n If you're working in Northern Yemen, for example,\n\n2:00:00.660 --> 2:00:03.700\n you're going to have someone from the de facto authorities\n\n2:00:03.700 --> 2:00:06.740\n with you anyway the entire time you're there.\n\n2:00:06.740 --> 2:00:10.940\n So the authorities are with you in form anyway.\n\n2:00:10.940 --> 2:00:15.940\n Regarding fear, yeah, of course.\n\n2:00:17.340 --> 2:00:20.740\n I mean, fear is a natural human emotion, right?\n\n2:00:20.740 --> 2:00:25.740\n And I think we have a weird mindset,\n\n2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:29.980\n this sort of heroic mindset surrounding fear in the US,\n\n2:00:29.980 --> 2:00:33.060\n which I don't pay tribute to.\n\n2:00:34.180 --> 2:00:37.780\n I believe as a natural human emotion,\n\n2:00:37.780 --> 2:00:40.180\n it's an alarm bell that I need to pay attention to.\n\n2:00:40.180 --> 2:00:45.180\n And I think rather than pretending to be brave,\n\n2:00:47.340 --> 2:00:52.340\n I think you have to just acknowledge that fear has a place\n\n2:00:52.860 --> 2:00:54.540\n to keep you alive.\n\n2:00:54.540 --> 2:00:59.540\n And I think it's a matter of not letting the fear arrest you\n\n2:01:01.100 --> 2:01:04.740\n and allowing the fear to live and then acting anyway.\n\n2:01:04.740 --> 2:01:07.620\n Don't you think as a documentary filmmaker,\n\n2:01:07.620 --> 2:01:10.500\n the fear is a really good signal\n\n2:01:10.500 --> 2:01:12.820\n for potentially a good thing to do\n\n2:01:12.820 --> 2:01:14.900\n because there's a story there?\n\n2:01:14.900 --> 2:01:17.340\n So is fear is an indicator that you shouldn't do it\n\n2:01:17.340 --> 2:01:19.220\n or is it an indicator that you should do it?\n\n2:01:19.220 --> 2:01:22.980\n It's probably an indication you should do it, right?\n\n2:01:22.980 --> 2:01:26.700\n And strangely, I think that's why,\n\n2:01:27.700 --> 2:01:30.500\n I think that if there's something unusual\n\n2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:32.260\n about the work I do in some part,\n\n2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:35.180\n it's because of these types of stories, right?\n\n2:01:35.180 --> 2:01:38.020\n They're hard to access, but you also have to have\n\n2:01:38.020 --> 2:01:43.020\n a threshold of willingness to do them when you can't,\n\n2:01:46.940 --> 2:01:50.180\n there is no guarantee of physical safety, right?\n\n2:01:50.180 --> 2:01:52.860\n And maybe that's why you should do them.\n\n2:01:52.860 --> 2:01:56.260\n I'm very much motivated by the things that scare me.\n\n2:01:56.260 --> 2:02:00.300\n They seem to direct the things that are worth doing\n\n2:02:00.300 --> 2:02:01.980\n in this all too short life.\n\n2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:05.100\n How often do you interact with our friendly friends\n\n2:02:05.100 --> 2:02:07.580\n at the police departments of various locations?\n\n2:02:07.580 --> 2:02:12.580\n Like, because of the humanitarian nature of your work,\n\n2:02:12.900 --> 2:02:17.020\n are you able to avoid all such friendly conversations\n\n2:02:17.020 --> 2:02:21.620\n or are you often making friends with our?\n\n2:02:21.620 --> 2:02:25.220\n I try to avoid the friendly police people\n\n2:02:25.220 --> 2:02:27.220\n all over the world as much as possible,\n\n2:02:28.260 --> 2:02:33.260\n but in some instances, it's important to be proactive,\n\n2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:36.380\n right, and make sure that they know what you're doing\n\n2:02:36.380 --> 2:02:37.580\n before you do it.\n\n2:02:37.580 --> 2:02:40.700\n So it's all about the context and the situation.\n\n2:02:41.620 --> 2:02:43.620\n For example, working in Northern Yemen,\n\n2:02:43.620 --> 2:02:45.620\n you couldn't film for five minutes\n\n2:02:45.620 --> 2:02:47.260\n if you didn't have paperwork,\n\n2:02:47.260 --> 2:02:48.700\n because you'd be taken away.\n\n2:02:48.700 --> 2:02:50.740\n So you have to make sure you have all those permissions\n\n2:02:50.740 --> 2:02:51.580\n ahead of time.\n\n2:02:53.740 --> 2:02:58.740\n 50 Feet from Syria, I would love to talk\n\n2:02:58.740 --> 2:03:00.700\n at least a little bit about this film.\n\n2:03:00.700 --> 2:03:03.900\n First, can you, high level, can you tell\n\n2:03:03.900 --> 2:03:05.420\n what this documentary is about?\n\n2:03:05.420 --> 2:03:09.380\n Yeah, it was early in the Syrian uprising,\n\n2:03:09.380 --> 2:03:14.380\n and we returned to the Syrian Turkish border\n\n2:03:15.740 --> 2:03:18.780\n with a Syrian American orthopedic surgeon\n\n2:03:18.780 --> 2:03:21.420\n who was volunteering, operating on refugees\n\n2:03:21.420 --> 2:03:24.820\n as they float across the border from Syria into Turkey.\n\n2:03:24.820 --> 2:03:27.660\n And it was an attempt at the time,\n\n2:03:27.660 --> 2:03:30.580\n before a lot of films had come out about the conflict,\n\n2:03:30.580 --> 2:03:35.580\n to really show again the effects of the war on civilians.\n\n2:03:38.660 --> 2:03:41.820\n You've heard me echo that sentiment multiple times now,\n\n2:03:41.820 --> 2:03:46.820\n but people knew there was a major conflict in Syria,\n\n2:03:47.020 --> 2:03:50.060\n but didn't really understand the form that that was taking\n\n2:03:50.060 --> 2:03:51.740\n and the impact it was having.\n\n2:03:51.740 --> 2:03:55.420\n And so we embedded into the,\n\n2:03:55.420 --> 2:03:58.660\n at the time it was the only clinic in Turkey\n\n2:03:58.660 --> 2:04:02.020\n that was sanctioned by the Turkish government\n\n2:04:02.020 --> 2:04:04.900\n to treat Syrian refugees.\n\n2:04:04.900 --> 2:04:08.220\n And so we filmed there with surgeons\n\n2:04:08.220 --> 2:04:11.060\n as they operated on war victims.\n\n2:04:11.060 --> 2:04:14.060\n And we also went into Syria into some of the camps as well.\n\n2:04:14.060 --> 2:04:17.780\n So in this film, there's a man who crosses the border\n\n2:04:17.780 --> 2:04:19.540\n every day to retrieve the wounded\n\n2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:21.580\n and fair them safety and care.\n\n2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:25.300\n And you also mentioned about heroism in the United States.\n\n2:04:25.300 --> 2:04:29.940\n Can you tell me about this man and just people like him?\n\n2:04:29.940 --> 2:04:31.740\n Like what's the heroic action\n\n2:04:32.700 --> 2:04:35.780\n in some of these places that you've visited?\n\n2:04:35.780 --> 2:04:37.540\n So in that instance, you know,\n\n2:04:37.540 --> 2:04:41.100\n I thought of him as the Turkish Schindler, right?\n\n2:04:41.100 --> 2:04:46.100\n Because he was a human being who of his own volition,\n\n2:04:46.180 --> 2:04:48.820\n no one was paying him to do this,\n\n2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:53.580\n but he was spending much of his time.\n\n2:04:53.580 --> 2:04:55.380\n He was just a local businessman\n\n2:04:55.380 --> 2:04:57.740\n who really saw the need in the camps\n\n2:04:57.740 --> 2:05:00.260\n right across the border 10 K away.\n\n2:05:00.260 --> 2:05:04.260\n And he saw the medical need in particular\n\n2:05:04.260 --> 2:05:07.380\n and how hard it was to get people\n\n2:05:07.380 --> 2:05:11.180\n in desperate medical conditions across the border\n\n2:05:11.180 --> 2:05:13.700\n where there was a clinic just right across the border.\n\n2:05:13.700 --> 2:05:17.940\n But because of the security and the layers of security,\n\n2:05:17.940 --> 2:05:20.020\n they couldn't get out by themselves.\n\n2:05:20.020 --> 2:05:24.020\n So he took it upon himself as a Turkish person\n\n2:05:24.020 --> 2:05:26.940\n to build relationships with the Turkish guards,\n\n2:05:26.940 --> 2:05:28.940\n which was relatively easy.\n\n2:05:28.940 --> 2:05:31.340\n And then he built relationships\n\n2:05:31.340 --> 2:05:34.460\n with sort of the guards in the no man's land\n\n2:05:34.460 --> 2:05:36.220\n between the Syrian guards\n\n2:05:36.220 --> 2:05:38.460\n and sort of those who lived in the middle area.\n\n2:05:38.460 --> 2:05:41.260\n And then also with the Syrian guards at the camp.\n\n2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:44.940\n And he would drive out there daily and bring them food,\n\n2:05:44.940 --> 2:05:45.980\n right?\n\n2:05:45.980 --> 2:05:47.620\n Talk them up and build relationships.\n\n2:05:47.620 --> 2:05:49.940\n And so every day he would bring these guards food\n\n2:05:49.940 --> 2:05:51.500\n and build relationships with them.\n\n2:05:51.500 --> 2:05:54.380\n And what that meant was eventually, right?\n\n2:05:54.380 --> 2:05:58.740\n He had this avenue of access to and from the camps.\n\n2:05:58.740 --> 2:06:00.340\n And so he started using it\n\n2:06:00.340 --> 2:06:05.100\n and he would drive this avenue of access\n\n2:06:05.100 --> 2:06:08.020\n through the three layers of guards each day.\n\n2:06:08.020 --> 2:06:10.420\n And then they would open the gates for him\n\n2:06:10.420 --> 2:06:13.940\n because he had made himself trustworthy in their eyes.\n\n2:06:13.940 --> 2:06:18.420\n And he would receive the most desperate medical cases\n\n2:06:18.420 --> 2:06:21.900\n that were coming from all over Northern Syria, right?\n\n2:06:21.900 --> 2:06:23.500\n To receive medical treatment.\n\n2:06:23.500 --> 2:06:25.380\n And he would, as you see in the film,\n\n2:06:25.380 --> 2:06:28.980\n he would ferry them into the back of his car, right?\n\n2:06:28.980 --> 2:06:31.700\n And then drive them to the hospital\n\n2:06:31.700 --> 2:06:33.540\n where they would receive operations.\n\n2:06:33.540 --> 2:06:36.620\n And then he would bring them back if they wanted\n\n2:06:36.620 --> 2:06:39.460\n after they'd healed and recovered back to Syria,\n\n2:06:39.460 --> 2:06:41.900\n if they wanted to return out post recovery.\n\n2:06:41.900 --> 2:06:44.060\n And he didn't get paid for that.\n\n2:06:44.060 --> 2:06:46.580\n He was spending his own money to do it\n\n2:06:46.580 --> 2:06:49.580\n because he saw other human beings in need.\n\n2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:52.820\n And it's like we were talking about earlier.\n\n2:06:52.820 --> 2:06:54.620\n That's heroic, right?\n\n2:06:54.620 --> 2:06:55.940\n That's selfless.\n\n2:06:55.940 --> 2:06:59.940\n That's aspirational for me, right?\n\n2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:03.940\n Here's someone who is spending their time on the planet\n\n2:07:03.940 --> 2:07:06.740\n doing something of value and good to other human beings.\n\n2:07:07.700 --> 2:07:09.380\n I mean, if you draw parallels to Schindler,\n\n2:07:09.380 --> 2:07:13.620\n I feel like the fascinating thing about Schindler\n\n2:07:13.620 --> 2:07:18.260\n is that he's kind of a flawed human\n\n2:07:18.260 --> 2:07:21.660\n and is not the kind of human that does these things usually.\n\n2:07:21.660 --> 2:07:23.500\n But he just can't help it.\n\n2:07:23.500 --> 2:07:25.060\n And that's like the basic humanity.\n\n2:07:25.060 --> 2:07:30.060\n Despite who you are, the basic humanity shines through.\n\n2:07:30.340 --> 2:07:34.940\n I think the whims of war test people in those ways, right?\n\n2:07:34.940 --> 2:07:39.620\n They ask of you things that you may not even know\n\n2:07:39.620 --> 2:07:41.220\n were going to be asked of you.\n\n2:07:41.220 --> 2:07:43.700\n And then it speaks to who you are fundamentally\n\n2:07:43.700 --> 2:07:44.980\n as a human being.\n\n2:07:44.980 --> 2:07:48.860\n They reveal who you are as a human being, just as you said.\n\n2:07:51.020 --> 2:07:55.180\n Let me ask a kind of stupid technical question\n\n2:07:55.180 --> 2:07:58.180\n about publications of movies and so on.\n\n2:07:58.180 --> 2:08:02.340\n I've been recently becoming good friends with Thomas Tall,\n\n2:08:02.340 --> 2:08:04.180\n who was the producer.\n\n2:08:04.180 --> 2:08:06.340\n His company, Legendary, funded some of the big\n\n2:08:06.340 --> 2:08:08.540\n sort of blockbuster films and so on.\n\n2:08:08.540 --> 2:08:11.420\n And so obviously money is part of filmmaking,\n\n2:08:11.420 --> 2:08:13.820\n but also the release of movies.\n\n2:08:13.820 --> 2:08:18.820\n And me as a consumer, with Netflix, with YouTube,\n\n2:08:21.740 --> 2:08:23.700\n that's one of the reasons I'm a huge fan of YouTube\n\n2:08:23.700 --> 2:08:26.860\n is it's like out in the open.\n\n2:08:26.860 --> 2:08:30.380\n Access, especially historical access.\n\n2:08:30.380 --> 2:08:33.940\n Like over time, you can look back years later.\n\n2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:35.860\n If you pay some money, you can watch\n\n2:08:35.860 --> 2:08:38.340\n some of the great films ever made.\n\n2:08:38.340 --> 2:08:41.420\n YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, I don't know what other services\n\n2:08:41.420 --> 2:08:44.100\n there are, HBO, Paramount.\n\n2:08:44.100 --> 2:08:44.940\n Paramount Plus.\n\n2:08:44.940 --> 2:08:46.020\n Paramount Plus.\n\n2:08:48.260 --> 2:08:50.100\n Anyway, there's all these platforms.\n\n2:08:51.260 --> 2:08:52.740\n Spotify now.\n\n2:08:55.980 --> 2:08:59.020\n I understand they want to create paywalls and so on.\n\n2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:02.500\n It makes sense, but I'm a huge fan of openness\n\n2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:04.660\n and I'm really kind of torn by this whole thing.\n\n2:09:04.660 --> 2:09:07.300\n Anyway, that's a discussion for perhaps another time.\n\n2:09:07.300 --> 2:09:11.820\n But the short question is why is it so hard\n\n2:09:11.820 --> 2:09:15.700\n to watch your documentaries and other films,\n\n2:09:15.700 --> 2:09:18.980\n other incredible films on the internet?\n\n2:09:20.020 --> 2:09:23.100\n If I want to pay unlimited amount of money,\n\n2:09:24.100 --> 2:09:26.420\n I want to pay a lot of money to watch it.\n\n2:09:26.420 --> 2:09:27.940\n Why is it so hard?\n\n2:09:27.940 --> 2:09:30.780\n Well, Lifeboat is streaming free on the New Yorker.\n\n2:09:32.180 --> 2:09:35.420\n Yes, I saw that, which is interesting.\n\n2:09:35.420 --> 2:09:37.340\n That doesn't make any sense.\n\n2:09:37.340 --> 2:09:41.660\n And then also Hunger Ward is on Paramount Plus,\n\n2:09:41.660 --> 2:09:45.660\n but also it's also streaming free.\n\n2:09:45.660 --> 2:09:47.940\n So you can either go through a paywall\n\n2:09:47.940 --> 2:09:52.180\n or you can watch it with ads with Big Macs interspersed.\n\n2:09:52.180 --> 2:09:53.060\n Big Macs.\n\n2:09:53.060 --> 2:09:53.900\n Sometimes.\n\n2:09:53.900 --> 2:09:55.660\n Yeah, the contrast.\n\n2:09:55.660 --> 2:09:56.980\n It's tough.\n\n2:09:56.980 --> 2:10:00.380\n Well, no, it really reveals the power of the documentary.\n\n2:10:01.300 --> 2:10:04.380\n No, but it's still not, even those platforms are,\n\n2:10:04.380 --> 2:10:07.780\n I mean, they're not as easily accessible\n\n2:10:07.780 --> 2:10:09.580\n because you have to like, you have to use,\n\n2:10:09.580 --> 2:10:13.300\n you have to think and you have to chase a particular.\n\n2:10:13.300 --> 2:10:15.180\n You have to chase it, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n2:10:15.180 --> 2:10:17.020\n I guess from an economic standpoint,\n\n2:10:17.020 --> 2:10:19.420\n the answer to that is pretty clear, right?\n\n2:10:19.420 --> 2:10:21.620\n It may not be what people want to watch.\n\n2:10:22.780 --> 2:10:25.540\n Maybe people want to watch reality.\n\n2:10:25.540 --> 2:10:30.540\n Maybe people want to watch animal rescue shows\n\n2:10:30.540 --> 2:10:35.540\n here in the US, which is exactly why in part,\n\n2:10:36.260 --> 2:10:40.640\n I think it's so vital that we continue to do stories\n\n2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:44.300\n on things that aren't about flowers and puppy dogs, right?\n\n2:10:44.300 --> 2:10:45.260\n I would push back on that.\n\n2:10:45.260 --> 2:10:50.260\n So there's TikTok and you could say,\n\n2:10:51.060 --> 2:10:55.880\n well, look, humans just want to watch really short content\n\n2:10:55.880 --> 2:10:58.260\n because they seem to be addicted to that kind of thing.\n\n2:10:58.260 --> 2:11:00.100\n That's partially true.\n\n2:11:00.100 --> 2:11:04.200\n But they also watch two, three, four, five hour podcasts.\n\n2:11:06.220 --> 2:11:07.380\n On TikTok?\n\n2:11:07.380 --> 2:11:09.700\n No, there's different platforms for that.\n\n2:11:09.700 --> 2:11:12.060\n It's a place called YouTube, I'll teach you about it.\n\n2:11:12.060 --> 2:11:14.340\n Okay, yeah, I've never heard of it.\n\n2:11:14.340 --> 2:11:16.940\n It's a good place to publish documentaries, I think.\n\n2:11:18.900 --> 2:11:21.860\n Humans are interested in a lot of things\n\n2:11:21.860 --> 2:11:25.900\n and I've seen many times a thing that you think\n\n2:11:25.900 --> 2:11:29.060\n is a niche thing become a very big thing.\n\n2:11:29.060 --> 2:11:30.980\n But for them to become mainstream,\n\n2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:32.300\n they have to have a platform\n\n2:11:32.300 --> 2:11:35.060\n that allows for the mainstream to happen.\n\n2:11:35.060 --> 2:11:35.900\n The access.\n\n2:11:35.900 --> 2:11:39.940\n The access, the dumb, simple, frictionless access.\n\n2:11:39.940 --> 2:11:43.560\n The frictionless access is a really important thing.\n\n2:11:44.780 --> 2:11:48.420\n Paywalls create friction and not just because of the money.\n\n2:11:49.500 --> 2:11:52.100\n It can be free, but if you have to click on a thing\n\n2:11:52.100 --> 2:11:55.620\n or maybe sign up or put your email,\n\n2:11:55.620 --> 2:12:00.620\n it prevents you to enjoy the thing you would really enjoy\n\n2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:06.660\n and you know you would enjoy,\n\n2:12:06.660 --> 2:12:10.820\n but your baser human nature prevents you from enjoying\n\n2:12:10.820 --> 2:12:14.240\n because you can just open up TikTok and keep scrolling.\n\n2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:17.000\n So that's just something to say about platforms\n\n2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.660\n because I think the things that need platforms the most\n\n2:12:21.660 --> 2:12:23.940\n are things like your films.\n\n2:12:23.940 --> 2:12:27.260\n The things that I think a lot of people would love watching.\n\n2:12:27.260 --> 2:12:30.460\n They're very important and they can have viral impact\n\n2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:32.860\n on the world that is fundamentally positive.\n\n2:12:32.860 --> 2:12:35.460\n You know, it's just, it makes me sad\n\n2:12:35.460 --> 2:12:40.460\n that there's not a machine for celebrating those films.\n\n2:12:41.900 --> 2:12:44.180\n There are lots of machines to celebrate them,\n\n2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:47.520\n but they're just not as always accessible as YouTube, right?\n\n2:12:47.520 --> 2:12:49.080\n I mean, as soon as you write me that check\n\n2:12:49.080 --> 2:12:51.340\n for a trillion dollars when I walk out of here,\n\n2:12:51.340 --> 2:12:53.340\n then I'm gonna put all my films on YouTube\n\n2:12:53.340 --> 2:12:55.380\n because then I won't have to worry about, you know,\n\n2:12:55.380 --> 2:12:58.020\n selling them in order so I can make the next film\n\n2:12:58.020 --> 2:13:00.860\n because you know, film is not just an art.\n\n2:13:00.860 --> 2:13:02.900\n It's also an industry, right?\n\n2:13:02.900 --> 2:13:06.540\n And that tension between the two is a constant interplay\n\n2:13:06.540 --> 2:13:08.740\n that is a reality for me.\n\n2:13:08.740 --> 2:13:10.460\n So I always have to think about\n\n2:13:11.980 --> 2:13:14.800\n how can I access the largest audience,\n\n2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:19.300\n but also, right, go out and shoot the next film, right?\n\n2:13:19.300 --> 2:13:22.320\n So that longevity question is also an issue\n\n2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:26.820\n and the finances are part of that sort of equation\n\n2:13:26.820 --> 2:13:29.540\n that I constantly have to rewrite over and over again.\n\n2:13:29.540 --> 2:13:32.260\n How often, as a creative mind,\n\n2:13:32.260 --> 2:13:35.580\n do you feel the constraints, the financial constraints?\n\n2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:41.140\n I wish I could do a lot more films\n\n2:13:41.140 --> 2:13:44.820\n that I can't always because of financial constraints.\n\n2:13:44.820 --> 2:13:46.180\n So it's the number of films.\n\n2:13:46.180 --> 2:13:47.020\n Yeah.\n\n2:13:48.100 --> 2:13:51.540\n And is a film that you do currently,\n\n2:13:51.540 --> 2:13:53.900\n is a film that you do at any one time\n\n2:13:53.900 --> 2:13:56.460\n as you're filming it already funded\n\n2:13:56.460 --> 2:13:59.040\n or is it the funding from previous stuff\n\n2:13:59.040 --> 2:14:01.140\n that you're trying to use?\n\n2:14:01.140 --> 2:14:02.780\n Before Hunger Ward,\n\n2:14:05.100 --> 2:14:08.200\n I would just take a flyer on my films, right?\n\n2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:12.920\n Where I would just say this meets the so what threshold.\n\n2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:17.540\n This is a story that has to be told and I want to tell it.\n\n2:14:17.540 --> 2:14:19.620\n And then I could just go shoot it.\n\n2:14:19.620 --> 2:14:22.820\n And usually on credit, usually on a credit card, right?\n\n2:14:22.820 --> 2:14:27.460\n So based on a belief that Lifeboat was done that way.\n\n2:14:27.460 --> 2:14:28.300\n Yes.\n\n2:14:28.300 --> 2:14:29.120\n Right?\n\n2:14:29.120 --> 2:14:29.960\n 50 Feet from Syria was done that way.\n\n2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:32.220\n So you're on a boat, broke.\n\n2:14:32.220 --> 2:14:33.060\n Yeah.\n\n2:14:33.060 --> 2:14:34.880\n Yeah, but it's free food, right?\n\n2:14:34.880 --> 2:14:37.100\n And free lodging because there's a bunk on the boat.\n\n2:14:37.100 --> 2:14:41.620\n But I do that not intending to stay broke, right?\n\n2:14:41.620 --> 2:14:44.080\n But based on a foundational belief\n\n2:14:44.080 --> 2:14:47.520\n that if I bring to bear\n\n2:14:47.520 --> 2:14:52.520\n all of my sort of quiver of creative arrows to it, right?\n\n2:14:52.980 --> 2:14:56.640\n That I can create something of value, right?\n\n2:14:56.640 --> 2:15:00.220\n In the world, but hopefully also financially\n\n2:15:00.220 --> 2:15:01.980\n that then I can sell to someone.\n\n2:15:01.980 --> 2:15:05.020\n And you know, every time I've done that Lex,\n\n2:15:05.020 --> 2:15:06.940\n I've gotten into the black.\n\n2:15:06.940 --> 2:15:11.140\n So it's a risk and I have to have a certain risk threshold\n\n2:15:11.140 --> 2:15:12.380\n financially to do that.\n\n2:15:12.380 --> 2:15:14.420\n But I believe so deeply in these stories\n\n2:15:14.420 --> 2:15:15.640\n that I'm willing to do that.\n\n2:15:15.640 --> 2:15:17.160\n I didn't have to do that with Hunger Ward.\n\n2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:20.060\n Luckily I had funders for that film.\n\n2:15:21.420 --> 2:15:22.500\n Yeah.\n\n2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:24.420\n Yeah, take risks in this life.\n\n2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:25.720\n It's gonna pay off.\n\n2:15:26.660 --> 2:15:28.340\n Which reminds me of, let me ask you,\n\n2:15:28.340 --> 2:15:31.060\n I already asked you for advice about,\n\n2:15:31.060 --> 2:15:34.260\n for a filmmaker, how to win an Oscar.\n\n2:15:34.260 --> 2:15:35.780\n Well, I haven't won an Oscar.\n\n2:15:35.780 --> 2:15:38.080\n How to get nominated for an Oscar, that's true.\n\n2:15:39.500 --> 2:15:42.080\n Or just how to make great documentaries,\n\n2:15:42.080 --> 2:15:42.920\n how to make great film.\n\n2:15:42.920 --> 2:15:44.920\n But let me ask, even zoom out bigger.\n\n2:15:44.920 --> 2:15:48.220\n You mentioned some of these things,\n\n2:15:48.220 --> 2:15:50.420\n doing the things that you think matters.\n\n2:15:50.420 --> 2:15:52.920\n What advice would you give to young people,\n\n2:15:52.920 --> 2:15:54.580\n high school, college,\n\n2:15:55.920 --> 2:16:00.920\n dreaming of living a life worth living?\n\n2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:03.800\n What advice would you give them about career\n\n2:16:03.800 --> 2:16:06.000\n or maybe just life in general?\n\n2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:08.000\n How to have a life they can be proud of?\n\n2:16:09.820 --> 2:16:11.240\n Yeah, I don't know how you're gonna react to this\n\n2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:13.020\n given sort of your expertise.\n\n2:16:13.020 --> 2:16:17.320\n But I would say put down the smartphone,\n\n2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:19.480\n step away from the monitor, right?\n\n2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:23.640\n Because real life is not a screen, right?\n\n2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:27.040\n I believe that sort of the foundational skills\n\n2:16:27.040 --> 2:16:30.380\n which are conducive and important to success\n\n2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:34.800\n aren't necessarily those technical skills\n\n2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:39.440\n which we're going to learn in trade schools or university.\n\n2:16:39.440 --> 2:16:43.280\n I think they're more foundational than that.\n\n2:16:43.280 --> 2:16:48.160\n They're learning how to interact and listen.\n\n2:16:48.160 --> 2:16:49.000\n With humans?\n\n2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:54.000\n With humans, yeah, to really see and listen, right?\n\n2:16:54.840 --> 2:16:55.840\n And observe.\n\n2:16:55.840 --> 2:16:58.560\n And observe, right?\n\n2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:00.600\n And how to step out of your door\n\n2:17:00.600 --> 2:17:03.020\n and if the electricity goes out, right?\n\n2:17:03.020 --> 2:17:05.040\n And you're five miles away from your house,\n\n2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:07.320\n you don't need a smartphone to get home\n\n2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:10.220\n because you've set visual markers for yourself\n\n2:17:10.220 --> 2:17:12.500\n on how to get back to where you live, right?\n\n2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:15.040\n I think we're in danger right now\n\n2:17:16.000 --> 2:17:18.800\n of living in a world where\n\n2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:21.440\n if the satellites stop functioning, right?\n\n2:17:22.400 --> 2:17:23.480\n Then a whole lot of people\n\n2:17:23.480 --> 2:17:27.760\n have become completely dysfunctional, right?\n\n2:17:27.760 --> 2:17:30.900\n Because we're so reliant upon the screens in our lives.\n\n2:17:30.900 --> 2:17:33.200\n So I think there's a lot of foundational skills\n\n2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:34.800\n that have nothing to do with technology\n\n2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:38.000\n that we need to learn and everything rests upon those.\n\n2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:39.160\n So I would say learn those foundations,\n\n2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:40.800\n learn how to write well.\n\n2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:43.360\n Read a lot, right?\n\n2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:45.640\n It's a different kind of knowledge and wisdom\n\n2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:47.400\n that comes out of that.\n\n2:17:47.400 --> 2:17:49.520\n So reading is kind of the equivalent of listening\n\n2:17:49.520 --> 2:17:51.000\n and observing and writing is\n\n2:17:53.200 --> 2:17:57.020\n kind of integration of all of that\n\n2:17:57.020 --> 2:17:58.480\n that you've observed and listened to\n\n2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:00.280\n and tried to express something with that.\n\n2:18:00.280 --> 2:18:02.600\n So I think my training in the theater\n\n2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:06.720\n has served me so well in the documentary world, right?\n\n2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:08.960\n Because it's all about interaction\n\n2:18:08.960 --> 2:18:11.920\n and listening and talking and dialogue, right?\n\n2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:14.200\n And that's what I do in documentaries, right?\n\n2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:15.840\n Is I listen.\n\n2:18:15.840 --> 2:18:19.140\n Yeah, we mentioned fear.\n\n2:18:20.040 --> 2:18:22.640\n Being an introvert, I'm very afraid of people\n\n2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:25.840\n but I'm drawn to them and fascinated by them\n\n2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:26.960\n because of that.\n\n2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.240\n Enjoy listening to them.\n\n2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:29.080\n Totally.\n\n2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:31.960\n And observing them.\n\n2:18:31.960 --> 2:18:33.120\n And you mentioned reading.\n\n2:18:33.120 --> 2:18:35.380\n You mentioned books as a catalyst,\n\n2:18:35.380 --> 2:18:37.960\n as a stimulator of your imagination.\n\n2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:42.380\n Is there books in your life, a couple, one, two, three,\n\n2:18:42.380 --> 2:18:46.240\n that kind of left an impact\n\n2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:50.920\n or a little bit of a spark of inspiration\n\n2:18:50.920 --> 2:18:54.400\n early on in life that stand out from your memory?\n\n2:18:54.400 --> 2:18:58.360\n I was given The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran\n\n2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:01.840\n as a graduation present from my high school\n\n2:19:01.840 --> 2:19:03.040\n English teacher.\n\n2:19:03.040 --> 2:19:05.880\n And I still have that book in a special place\n\n2:19:05.880 --> 2:19:08.600\n on my bookshelf because I think it speaks\n\n2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:11.780\n to the nature of human experience, right?\n\n2:19:11.780 --> 2:19:13.840\n And I return to it all the time\n\n2:19:13.840 --> 2:19:15.760\n because there's wisdom there, you know?\n\n2:19:15.760 --> 2:19:18.240\n But there's many, many books.\n\n2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:21.760\n Fiction or nonfiction, what connects with you usually\n\n2:19:21.760 --> 2:19:23.040\n in the past, for the imagination?\n\n2:19:23.040 --> 2:19:26.480\n I read mostly nonfiction most of the time.\n\n2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:28.920\n Ten Points is a book I love a lot.\n\n2:19:28.920 --> 2:19:30.560\n What is Ten Points?\n\n2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:34.120\n Ten Points is, I think his name is Bill Strickland.\n\n2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:37.720\n He was the editor of, I think, Bicycle Magazine.\n\n2:19:37.720 --> 2:19:40.200\n And it's sort of his personal memoir\n\n2:19:40.200 --> 2:19:44.080\n of his experience growing up with a lot of abuse\n\n2:19:44.080 --> 2:19:46.700\n and how that transformed him as a human being.\n\n2:19:46.700 --> 2:19:49.260\n You know, one instrumental book for me\n\n2:19:49.260 --> 2:19:52.000\n that I bumped into in my early 20s,\n\n2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:54.160\n boy, these are all nonfiction,\n\n2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.720\n except for The Princess Bride.\n\n2:19:56.960 --> 2:19:59.160\n Have to mention, it's an outlier.\n\n2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:03.280\n No, no, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.\n\n2:20:03.280 --> 2:20:05.440\n I read that in my early 20s,\n\n2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:10.440\n and I found so many of the principles in that book.\n\n2:20:11.280 --> 2:20:13.260\n What are the habits from that one?\n\n2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:16.860\n Seek first to understand, then to be understood\n\n2:20:16.860 --> 2:20:18.760\n is one of them, you know?\n\n2:20:18.760 --> 2:20:21.800\n The notion of proactivity is one of them.\n\n2:20:21.800 --> 2:20:25.060\n It's really, and so I've held onto some of those principles\n\n2:20:25.060 --> 2:20:27.920\n through my life as well, for sure.\n\n2:20:27.920 --> 2:20:32.360\n What have been, you've observed\n\n2:20:33.880 --> 2:20:37.080\n suffering darker aspects of human nature\n\n2:20:37.080 --> 2:20:38.880\n in your own personal life.\n\n2:20:38.880 --> 2:20:42.960\n What has been some of the darkest moments in your life,\n\n2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:45.160\n darkest times in your life?\n\n2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:49.400\n Is there something that you went through\n\n2:20:49.400 --> 2:20:53.000\n and then perhaps you carry it through your work?\n\n2:20:53.000 --> 2:20:56.520\n Yeah, probably one of the darkest moments\n\n2:20:56.520 --> 2:21:00.840\n was an experience that I had, again, in my early 20s,\n\n2:21:00.840 --> 2:21:03.280\n and I was living in Southern California,\n\n2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:08.760\n and the Pacific Coast Highway\n\n2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:10.600\n that goes north and south along the beach,\n\n2:21:10.600 --> 2:21:13.980\n and there's that little concrete path\n\n2:21:13.980 --> 2:21:15.440\n that people jog and ride their bikes,\n\n2:21:15.440 --> 2:21:18.080\n and I was riding my bike on the PCH,\n\n2:21:18.960 --> 2:21:21.960\n and I was coming up to a corner on it,\n\n2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:26.960\n and I heard this tremendous crash, and it was really loud,\n\n2:21:28.920 --> 2:21:31.520\n and I came around the corner,\n\n2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:34.680\n and it was a car accident, a car crash.\n\n2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:38.000\n It was a multiple vehicle crash,\n\n2:21:38.000 --> 2:21:43.000\n and what had happened is that a Volvo had hit another car,\n\n2:21:44.480 --> 2:21:48.040\n and then when it hit it, it went over the top of the car\n\n2:21:48.040 --> 2:21:50.240\n and hit a Volkswagen van,\n\n2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:52.760\n and it peeled away the top of the Volkswagen van\n\n2:21:52.760 --> 2:21:55.060\n when it hit it and then landed.\n\n2:21:55.060 --> 2:21:59.480\n So three vehicles, and it just happened,\n\n2:21:59.480 --> 2:22:04.160\n and lying in the middle of the road\n\n2:22:04.160 --> 2:22:07.400\n was a body decapitated,\n\n2:22:08.560 --> 2:22:12.460\n and there was another person from one of the cars\n\n2:22:12.460 --> 2:22:15.360\n lying in the middle of the road, still alive,\n\n2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:17.920\n and then on the hood of the Volvo\n\n2:22:17.920 --> 2:22:21.120\n was this woman who had come through the windshield,\n\n2:22:21.120 --> 2:22:26.120\n just a mess, blood everywhere, moaning back and forth,\n\n2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:32.680\n and a bystander ran into the middle of the road\n\n2:22:32.680 --> 2:22:34.800\n and started administering first aid\n\n2:22:34.800 --> 2:22:37.040\n to the person lying in the road,\n\n2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:42.040\n and I stood there watching the scene\n\n2:22:42.440 --> 2:22:45.720\n and every fiber of my being,\n\n2:22:45.720 --> 2:22:50.720\n wanted to run to the woman on the hood of the Volvo\n\n2:22:50.720 --> 2:22:54.640\n and do something, anything, right, just to be there,\n\n2:22:54.640 --> 2:22:58.440\n and it was obvious to me that she was gonna die,\n\n2:22:59.400 --> 2:23:01.640\n but I felt like at least if I ran there,\n\n2:23:01.640 --> 2:23:05.760\n I could offer some comfort for her last moment,\n\n2:23:05.760 --> 2:23:09.760\n and right then, the sirens started to blare,\n\n2:23:09.760 --> 2:23:13.760\n and I knew that there'd be paramedics there\n\n2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:17.120\n within minutes, that people would come to help,\n\n2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:21.560\n and I froze, and I was scared,\n\n2:23:23.080 --> 2:23:24.880\n and I didn't do anything,\n\n2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:29.880\n and I watched while this woman died on the hood of the Volvo,\n\n2:23:33.760 --> 2:23:38.760\n and that experience is sort of seared into my consciousness,\n\n2:23:38.760 --> 2:23:42.600\n the fact that I watched and didn't act,\n\n2:23:42.600 --> 2:23:46.600\n I feel is one of the great failures of my life,\n\n2:23:46.600 --> 2:23:49.400\n that I wasn't able to act in a moment of need,\n\n2:23:49.400 --> 2:23:50.840\n no matter how small,\n\n2:23:51.840 --> 2:23:56.840\n and from that, I made a decision out of that experience\n\n2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:00.840\n that if I ever found myself in a situation\n\n2:24:00.840 --> 2:24:04.280\n where I had the ability to act and I could act\n\n2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:06.280\n to help another human being,\n\n2:24:06.280 --> 2:24:10.800\n I would act to help another human being in such need\n\n2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:15.800\n that I would act, that I wouldn't let fear freeze me.\n\n2:24:16.400 --> 2:24:21.400\n Instead, I would allow that fear to catalyze me into action\n\n2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:25.640\n and do something and intervene in whatever way I could,\n\n2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:27.440\n even if I didn't have the skillset.\n\n2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:33.720\n And in some ways, all of that echoes in your documentaries.\n\n2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:37.160\n I'm not gonna let fear stop you from trying to help.\n\n2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:40.800\n I think that experience, that experience of failure,\n\n2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:45.160\n what I framed as just human failure on my part\n\n2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:49.600\n is foundational probably to my work.\n\n2:24:49.600 --> 2:24:52.000\n I don't want that to happen again, Lex.\n\n2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.960\n I don't want to be that person who watches.\n\n2:24:54.960 --> 2:24:57.240\n I want to do what I can when I can.\n\n2:24:58.680 --> 2:25:02.720\n If we zoom out, you were just one human\n\n2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:05.120\n that witnessed that, that trauma.\n\n2:25:06.680 --> 2:25:09.640\n One human that witnessed so much suffering\n\n2:25:09.640 --> 2:25:11.520\n in different parts of the world.\n\n2:25:11.520 --> 2:25:15.760\n And as we zoom out across space and time and look at Earth,\n\n2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:20.760\n why do you think we're here on this Earth?\n\n2:25:21.400 --> 2:25:24.840\n What's the meaning of human civilization?\n\n2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:29.840\n What's the meaning of your life, of individual human life?\n\n2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:33.640\n And broadly speaking, what is the meaning of life?\n\n2:25:33.640 --> 2:25:35.760\n Skyfish, Cheryl.\n\n2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:37.280\n Oh boy, yeah.\n\n2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:44.920\n For me, I can speak personally on that only.\n\n2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:49.040\n And that's that I believe that the meaning of my life\n\n2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:52.680\n is to try to make the world a little bit better before I go.\n\n2:25:52.680 --> 2:25:57.680\n You know, I, when I was in theater in grad school,\n\n2:26:01.920 --> 2:26:06.040\n I directed a play called Shadowlands by C.S. Lewis.\n\n2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:09.000\n And there's a quote from that, it goes like this.\n\n2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:10.880\n We are like blocks of stone\n\n2:26:10.880 --> 2:26:15.040\n out of which the sculptor carves the forms of men.\n\n2:26:15.040 --> 2:26:19.000\n The blows of his chisel, which hurt us so much,\n\n2:26:19.000 --> 2:26:20.480\n are what make us perfect.\n\n2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:23.480\n Now, I would take away the perfect part, right?\n\n2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:27.560\n But I think I've remembered that quote for so many years\n\n2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:30.840\n because I believe in the underlying notion\n\n2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:33.520\n that the blows of the chisel,\n\n2:26:33.520 --> 2:26:36.040\n which are the experiences that we go through,\n\n2:26:36.040 --> 2:26:39.080\n shape us, right, necessarily so,\n\n2:26:39.080 --> 2:26:42.640\n and hopefully shape us into a better human being.\n\n2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:45.840\n And in my case, a human being that I hope\n\n2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:47.800\n can make the world a little better,\n\n2:26:47.800 --> 2:26:50.640\n you know, through those blows.\n\n2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:51.760\n Before it's over.\n\n2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:53.760\n Yeah, before it's over.\n\n2:26:53.760 --> 2:26:57.000\n Before you go, as you said, do you think about that?\n\n2:26:57.000 --> 2:27:02.000\n Do you think about the going part, your mortality?\n\n2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:03.160\n You ever think about that?\n\n2:27:03.160 --> 2:27:04.640\n You said you don't have a death wish,\n\n2:27:04.640 --> 2:27:07.760\n you try to minimize risk, but eventually it's gonna be over.\n\n2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:10.040\n Yeah, for all of us, absolutely.\n\n2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:11.360\n Well, speak for yourself.\n\n2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:13.560\n Well, you've got other plans as well.\n\n2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:15.680\n I tend to merge, you know,\n\n2:27:15.680 --> 2:27:18.240\n you've got other plans as well.\n\n2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:23.240\n I'm going to merge with robots, embody, no, not at all.\n\n2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:26.440\n Yes, for all of us, unfortunately or fortunately,\n\n2:27:26.440 --> 2:27:28.440\n or who the heck knows.\n\n2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:33.240\n But do you ponder your mortality?\n\n2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:34.440\n Are you afraid of it?\n\n2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:39.840\n I live with my mortality, knowing that it's fleeting,\n\n2:27:39.840 --> 2:27:43.160\n that my life is fleeting and that I'm gonna go\n\n2:27:43.160 --> 2:27:45.160\n into the ground, just like everyone else,\n\n2:27:45.160 --> 2:27:47.120\n or maybe as ashes, you know?\n\n2:27:48.840 --> 2:27:50.280\n So I live with that knowledge every day,\n\n2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:54.360\n but I don't allow it to stop me or hold me up.\n\n2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:58.080\n Rather, I really, it drives me, right?\n\n2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:00.120\n It drives me to try to get as much done\n\n2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:02.960\n as I can before I go, right?\n\n2:28:02.960 --> 2:28:05.680\n Yeah, so the knowledge of your death\n\n2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:07.720\n is a kind of dance partner,\n\n2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.480\n and you try to dance beautifully.\n\n2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:13.080\n This guy, you're an incredible human,\n\n2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:15.120\n incredible artist and filmmaker,\n\n2:28:16.080 --> 2:28:18.000\n and it's a huge honor that you would sit\n\n2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.840\n and spend your really valuable time with me today.\n\n2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:22.320\n I really, really enjoyed this conversation.\n\n2:28:22.320 --> 2:28:23.840\n I did too, thanks for having me, Lex,\n\n2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:25.920\n and thanks for doing what you do.\n\n2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:27.440\n Thanks for listening to this conversation\n\n2:28:27.440 --> 2:28:29.040\n with Sky Fist Gerald.\n\n2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:30.400\n To support this podcast,\n\n2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:33.160\n please check out our sponsors in the description.\n\n2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:35.320\n And now, let me leave you with some words\n\n2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:36.400\n from Elie Wiesel.\n\n2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:41.600\n The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.\n\n2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:45.760\n The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference.\n\n2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:49.760\n The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference.\n\n2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:54.760\n And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference.\n\n2:28:54.760 --> 2:29:10.760\n Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.\n\n"
