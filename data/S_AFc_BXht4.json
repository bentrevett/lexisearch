00:09.040\n She's a neuroscientist at Northeastern University\n\n00:09.040 --> 00:11.240\n and one of my favorite people.\n\n00:11.240 --> 00:13.400\n Her new book called Seven and a Half Lessons\n\n00:13.400 --> 00:16.720\n about the Brain is out now as of a couple of days ago,\n\n00:16.720 --> 00:19.520\n so you should definitely support Lisa by buying it\n\n00:19.520 --> 00:21.760\n and sharing with friends if you like it.\n\n00:21.760 --> 00:25.440\n It's a great short intro to the human brain.\n\n00:25.440 --> 00:27.000\n Quick mention of each sponsor,\n\n00:27.000 --> 00:29.840\n followed by some thoughts related to the episode.\n\n00:29.840 --> 00:32.040\n Athletic Greens, the all in one drink\n\n00:32.040 --> 00:33.920\n that I start every day with\n\n00:33.920 --> 00:36.480\n to cover all my nutritional bases.\n\n00:36.480 --> 00:39.440\n Eight Sleep, a mattress that cools itself\n\n00:39.440 --> 00:42.320\n and gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep.\n\n00:42.320 --> 00:45.080\n Masterclass, online courses that I enjoy\n\n00:45.080 --> 00:48.600\n from some of the most amazing people in history.\n\n00:48.600 --> 00:52.640\n And BetterHelp, online therapy with a licensed professional.\n\n00:52.640 --> 00:55.000\n Please check out these sponsors in the description\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:58.000\n to get a discount and to support this podcast.\n\n00:58.000 --> 01:00.160\n As a side note, let me say that Lisa,\n\n01:00.160 --> 01:02.360\n just like Manolis Calles,\n\n01:02.360 --> 01:05.240\n is a local brilliant mind and friend\n\n01:05.240 --> 01:08.120\n and someone I can see talking to many more times.\n\n01:08.120 --> 01:10.720\n Sometimes it's fun to talk to a scientist\n\n01:10.720 --> 01:12.600\n not just about their field of expertise,\n\n01:12.600 --> 01:15.840\n but also about random topics, even silly ones,\n\n01:15.840 --> 01:19.160\n from love to music to philosophy.\n\n01:19.160 --> 01:21.480\n Ultimately, it's about having fun,\n\n01:21.480 --> 01:23.760\n something I know nothing about.\n\n01:23.760 --> 01:25.800\n This conversation is certainly that.\n\n01:25.800 --> 01:28.760\n It may not always work, but it's worth a shot.\n\n01:28.760 --> 01:31.040\n I think it's valuable to alternate\n\n01:31.040 --> 01:32.960\n along all kinds of dimensions,\n\n01:32.960 --> 01:35.720\n like between deeper technical discussions\n\n01:35.720 --> 01:37.880\n and more fun random discussion,\n\n01:37.880 --> 01:40.720\n from liberal thinker to conservative thinker,\n\n01:40.720 --> 01:45.720\n from musician to athlete, from CEO to junior engineer,\n\n01:45.880 --> 01:48.000\n from friend to stranger.\n\n01:48.000 --> 01:51.480\n Variety makes life and conversation more interesting.\n\n01:51.480 --> 01:54.800\n Let's see where this little podcast journey goes.\n\n01:54.800 --> 01:57.040\n If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:57.040 --> 01:59.280\n

Friedman.\n\n02:05.240 --> 02:10.000\n And now, here's my conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett.\n\n02:11.040 --> 02:13.800\n Based on the comments in our previous conversation,\n\n02:13.800 --> 02:17.040\n I think a lot of people will be very disappointed,\n\n02:17.040 --> 02:20.920\n I should say, to learn that you are in fact married.\n\n02:20.920 --> 02:22.960\n As they say, all the good ones are taken.\n\n02:22.960 --> 02:27.960\n Okay, so I'm a fan of your husband as well, Dan.\n\n02:28.200 --> 02:29.760\n He's a programmer and musician,\n\n02:29.760 --> 02:32.080\n so a man after my own heart.\n\n02:32.080 --> 02:36.160\n Can I ask a ridiculously over romanticized question\n\n02:36.160 --> 02:40.960\n of when did you first fall in love with Dan?\n\n02:40.960 --> 02:45.360\n It's actually, it's a really romantic story, I think.\n\n02:45.360 --> 02:53.040\n So I was divorced by the time I was 26, 27, 26, I guess.\n\n02:53.040 --> 02:54.960\n And I was in my first academic job,\n\n02:54.960 --> 02:57.240\n which was Penn State University,\n\n02:57.240 --> 02:59.840\n which is in the middle of Pennsylvania,\n\n02:59.840 --> 03:01.040\n surrounded by mountains.\n\n03:01.040 --> 03:03.200\n So you have, it's four hours to get anywhere,\n\n03:03.200 --> 03:05.920\n to get to Philadelphia, New York, Washington.\n\n03:05.920 --> 03:07.960\n I mean, you're basically stuck, you know.\n\n03:09.320 --> 03:12.640\n And I was very fortunate to have\n\n03:12.640 --> 03:14.480\n a lot of other assistant professors\n\n03:14.480 --> 03:16.440\n who were hired at the same time as I was.\n\n03:16.440 --> 03:17.560\n So there were a lot of us,\n\n03:17.560 --> 03:20.440\n we were all friends, which was really fun.\n\n03:20.440 --> 03:24.320\n But I was single and I didn't wanna date a student.\n\n03:24.320 --> 03:27.560\n And there were no,\n\n03:27.560 --> 03:29.760\n and I wasn't gonna date somebody in my department,\n\n03:29.760 --> 03:32.160\n that's just a recipe for disaster.\n\n03:33.520 --> 03:35.400\n So even at 20, whatever you were,\n\n03:35.400 --> 03:37.160\n you were already wise enough to know that.\n\n03:37.160 --> 03:39.440\n Yeah, a little bit, maybe, yeah.\n\n03:39.440 --> 03:41.200\n I wouldn't call me wise at that age.\n\n03:41.200 --> 03:44.080\n But anyways, not sure that I would say that I'm wise now,\n\n03:44.080 --> 03:44.920\n but.\n\n03:46.080 --> 03:50.080\n And so after,\n\n03:50.080 --> 03:53.720\n I was spending probably 16 hours a day in the lab\n\n03:53.720 --> 03:57.240\n because it was my first year as an assistant professor\n\n03:57.240 --> 03:58.800\n and there's a lot to do.\n\n03:58.800 --> 04:02.640\n And I was also bitching and moaning to my friends\n\n04:02.640 --> 04:06.320\n that I hadn't had sex in I don't know how many months\n\n04:06.320 --> 04:10.520\n and I was starting to become unhappy with my life.\n\n04:10.520 --> 04:13.040\n And I think at a certain point,\n\n04:13.040 --> 04:15.560\n they just got tired of listening to me bitch and moan\n\n04:15.560 --> 04:18.320\n and said, just do something about it then,\n\n04:18.320 --> 04:20.360\n like if you're unhappy.\n\n04:20.360 --> 04:23.720\n And so the first thing I did was I made friends\n\n04:23.720 --> 04:25.720\n with a sushi chef in town.\n\n04:25.720 --> 04:28.840\n And this is like a State College, Pennsylvania\n\n04:28.840 --> 04:32.160\n in the early 90s was there was like a pizza shop\n\n04:32.160 --> 04:36.240\n and a sub shop and actually a very good bagel shop\n\n04:36.240 --> 04:39.120\n and one good coffee shop and maybe one nice restaurant.\n\n04:39.120 --> 04:40.160\n I mean, there was really,\n\n04:40.160 --> 04:44.440\n but there was the second son of a Japanese sushi chef\n\n04:44.440 --> 04:47.200\n who was not going to inherit the restaurant.\n\n04:47.200 --> 04:51.200\n And so he moved to Pennsylvania and was giving sushi lessons.\n\n04:51.200 --> 04:54.240\n So I met this guy, the sushi chef\n\n04:54.240 --> 04:57.400\n and we decided to throw a sushi party at the coffee shop.\n\n04:57.400 --> 04:59.680\n So we basically, it was the goal was to invite\n\n04:59.680 --> 05:04.680\n every eligible bachelor really within like a 20 mile radius.\n\n05:05.000 --> 05:07.000\n We had a totally fun time.\n\n05:07.000 --> 05:11.040\n I wore an awesome crushed velvet burgundy dress,\n\n05:11.040 --> 05:12.540\n it was beautiful dress.\n\n05:14.000 --> 05:16.560\n And I didn't meet any, I met a lot of new friends,\n\n05:16.560 --> 05:17.760\n but I did not meet anybody.\n\n05:17.760 --> 05:18.720\n So then I thought, okay, well,\n\n05:18.720 --> 05:20.960\n maybe I'll try the Personals ads,\n\n05:20.960 --> 05:23.400\n which I had never used before in my life.\n\n05:23.400 --> 05:28.400\n And I first tried the paper Personals ads.\n\n05:29.160 --> 05:30.000\n Like in the newspaper?\n\n05:30.000 --> 05:33.000\n Like in the newspaper, that didn't work.\n\n05:33.000 --> 05:33.960\n And then a friend of mine said,\n\n05:33.960 --> 05:36.600\n oh, you know, there's this thing called Net News.\n\n05:36.600 --> 05:40.160\n So we're going, this is like 1992 maybe.\n\n05:40.160 --> 05:43.840\n So there was this anonymous, you could do it anonymously.\n\n05:43.840 --> 05:48.840\n So you would read, you could post or you could read ads\n\n05:49.960 --> 05:54.920\n and then respond to an address which was anonymous\n\n05:54.920 --> 05:57.560\n and that was yoked to somebody's real address.\n\n05:57.560 --> 06:01.040\n And there was always a lag\n\n06:01.040 --> 06:04.880\n because it was this like a bulletin board sort of thing.\n\n06:04.880 --> 06:08.920\n So at first I read them over\n\n06:08.920 --> 06:12.680\n and I decided to respond to one or two.\n\n06:12.680 --> 06:15.240\n And, you know, it was interesting.\n\n06:15.240 --> 06:16.960\n Sorry, this is not on the internet.\n\n06:16.960 --> 06:18.320\n Yeah, this is totally on the internet.\n\n06:18.320 --> 06:20.160\n But it takes, there's a delay of a couple of days\n\n06:20.160 --> 06:21.000\n or whatever.\n\n06:21.000 --> 06:21.820\n Yeah, right, right.\n\n06:21.820 --> 06:25.160\n It's 1992, there's no web, web pictures.\n\n06:25.160 --> 06:27.120\n There's no pictures, the web doesn't exist.\n\n06:27.120 --> 06:30.600\n It's all done in ASCII format sort of.\n\n06:30.600 --> 06:33.280\n And, you know, but the ratio,\n\n06:33.280 --> 06:38.280\n but the ratio of men to women was like 10 to one.\n\n06:38.360 --> 06:39.840\n I mean, there were many more men\n\n06:39.840 --> 06:42.920\n because it was basically academics and the government.\n\n06:42.920 --> 06:44.400\n That was it.\n\n06:44.400 --> 06:47.020\n I mean, I think AOL maybe was just starting\n\n06:47.020 --> 06:48.220\n to become popular, but.\n\n06:51.240 --> 06:56.240\n And so the first person I met told me that he was a scientist\n\n06:56.240 --> 07:01.240\n who worked for NASA and, yeah.\n\n07:03.800 --> 07:07.040\n Anyways, it turned out that he didn't actually.\n\n07:07.040 --> 07:11.200\n Yeah, this is how they brag is like you elevate your,\n\n07:11.200 --> 07:12.840\n as opposed to saying you're taller than you are,\n\n07:12.840 --> 07:14.080\n you say like your position is higher.\n\n07:14.080 --> 07:16.720\n Yeah, and I actually, I would have been fine\n\n07:16.720 --> 07:18.360\n dating somebody who wasn't a scientist.\n\n07:18.360 --> 07:21.820\n It's just that they have, it's just that whoever I date\n\n07:21.820 --> 07:26.820\n has to just accept that I am and that I was pretty ambitious\n\n07:28.240 --> 07:30.320\n and was trying to make my career.\n\n07:30.320 --> 07:34.440\n And, you know, that's not, I think it's maybe more common\n\n07:34.440 --> 07:38.500\n now for men to maybe accept that in their female partners,\n\n07:38.500 --> 07:40.520\n but at that time, not so common.\n\n07:40.520 --> 07:41.880\n It could be intimidating, I guess.\n\n07:41.880 --> 07:44.120\n Yes, that has been said.\n\n07:44.120 --> 07:49.120\n And so then the next one I actually corresponded with,\n\n07:49.120 --> 07:51.620\n and we actually got to the point of talking on the phone,\n\n07:51.620 --> 07:53.880\n and we had this really kind of funny conversation\n\n07:53.880 --> 07:57.520\n where, you know, we're chatting and he said,\n\n07:57.520 --> 08:00.080\n he introduces the idea that, you know,\n\n08:00.080 --> 08:02.380\n he's really looking for a dominant woman.\n\n08:02.380 --> 08:05.240\n And I'm thinking, I'm a psychologist by training,\n\n08:05.240 --> 08:07.080\n so I'm thinking, oh, he means sex roles.\n\n08:07.080 --> 08:08.960\n Like, I'm like, no, I'm very assertive\n\n08:08.960 --> 08:10.320\n and I'm glad you think that, you know, okay.\n\n08:10.320 --> 08:13.940\n Anyways, long story short, that's not really what he meant.\n\n08:16.360 --> 08:17.200\n Okay, got it.\n\n08:17.200 --> 08:20.380\n Yeah, so, and I just, you know,\n\n08:20.380 --> 08:22.320\n that will just show you my level of naivete.\n\n08:22.320 --> 08:24.560\n Like, I was like, I didn't completely understand,\n\n08:24.560 --> 08:27.480\n but I was like, well, yeah, you know, no.\n\n08:27.480 --> 08:29.240\n At one point he asked me how I felt\n\n08:29.240 --> 08:33.520\n about him wearing my lingerie, and I was like,\n\n08:33.520 --> 08:35.680\n I don't even share my lingerie with my sister.\n\n08:35.680 --> 08:39.600\n Like, I don't share my lingerie with anybody, you know?\n\n08:39.600 --> 08:40.800\n No.\n\n08:40.800 --> 08:45.280\n The third one I interacted with was a banker\n\n08:45.280 --> 08:50.280\n who lived in Singapore, and that conversation\n\n08:50.880 --> 08:55.160\n didn't last very long because he made an analogy,\n\n08:55.160 --> 08:57.720\n I guess he made an analogy between me\n\n08:57.720 --> 09:01.640\n and a character in The Fountainhead,\n\n09:03.000 --> 09:06.160\n the woman who's raped in The Fountainhead,\n\n09:06.160 --> 09:08.620\n and I was like, okay, that's not.\n\n09:08.620 --> 09:09.460\n That's not a good.\n\n09:09.460 --> 09:11.440\n That's not a good, no, that's not a good one.\n\n09:11.440 --> 09:12.920\n Not that part, not that scene.\n\n09:12.920 --> 09:13.760\n Not that scene.\n\n09:13.760 --> 09:16.240\n So then I was like, okay, you know what?\n\n09:16.240 --> 09:18.440\n I'm gonna post my own ad, and so I did.\n\n09:18.440 --> 09:20.080\n I posted, well, first I wrote my ad,\n\n09:20.080 --> 09:22.600\n and then I, of course, I checked it with my friends\n\n09:22.600 --> 09:24.700\n who were all also assistant professors.\n\n09:24.700 --> 09:26.440\n They were like my little Greek chorus,\n\n09:26.440 --> 09:30.180\n and then I posted it, and I got something like,\n\n09:30.180 --> 09:34.280\n I don't know, 80 something responses in 24 hours.\n\n09:34.280 --> 09:35.120\n I mean, it was very.\n\n09:35.120 --> 09:36.440\n Do you remember the pitch?\n\n09:37.960 --> 09:40.920\n Like how you, I guess, condensed yourself?\n\n09:40.920 --> 09:43.880\n I don't remember it exactly, although Dan has it,\n\n09:44.840 --> 09:48.080\n but actually for our 20th wedding anniversary,\n\n09:48.080 --> 09:51.640\n he took our exchanges, and he printed them off\n\n09:51.640 --> 09:54.640\n and put them in a leather bound book for us to read,\n\n09:54.640 --> 09:55.880\n which was really sweet.\n\n09:57.240 --> 09:58.680\n Yeah, I think I was just really direct.\n\n09:58.680 --> 10:00.160\n Like I'm almost 30.\n\n10:00.160 --> 10:01.220\n I'm a scientist.\n\n10:01.220 --> 10:04.960\n I'm not looking, I'm looking for something serious.\n\n10:04.960 --> 10:08.960\n But the thing is, I forgot to say where my location was\n\n10:08.960 --> 10:12.000\n and my age, which I forgot.\n\n10:12.000 --> 10:14.680\n So I got lots of, I mean, I will say,\n\n10:14.680 --> 10:17.880\n so I printed off all of the responses,\n\n10:17.880 --> 10:22.280\n and I had all my friends over, and we had a big,\n\n10:22.280 --> 10:24.480\n I made a big pot of gumbo,\n\n10:24.480 --> 10:27.280\n and we drank through several bottles of wine\n\n10:27.280 --> 10:28.640\n reading these responses.\n\n10:28.640 --> 10:32.460\n And I would say for the most part, they were really sweet,\n\n10:32.460 --> 10:36.400\n like earnest and genuine as much as you could tell\n\n10:36.400 --> 10:37.320\n that somebody is being genuine.\n\n10:37.320 --> 10:40.320\n I mean, it seemed, there were a couple of really funky ones,\n\n10:40.320 --> 10:42.440\n like this one couple who told me\n\n10:42.440 --> 10:44.480\n that I was their soulmate, the two of them,\n\n10:44.480 --> 10:47.160\n when they were looking for a third person,\n\n10:47.160 --> 10:48.760\n and I was like, oh, okay.\n\n10:48.760 --> 10:53.760\n But mostly super, seemed like super genuine people.\n\n10:53.980 --> 10:57.600\n And so I chose five men to start corresponding with,\n\n10:57.600 --> 10:58.900\n and I was corresponding with them.\n\n10:58.900 --> 11:03.160\n And then about a week later, I get this other email.\n\n11:03.160 --> 11:05.020\n And okay, and then I post something the next day\n\n11:05.020 --> 11:06.760\n that said, okay, thank you so much,\n\n11:06.760 --> 11:10.320\n and I'm gonna, I answered every person back.\n\n11:10.320 --> 11:11.620\n But then after that, I said, okay,\n\n11:11.620 --> 11:13.600\n and I'm not gonna answer anymore,\n\n11:13.600 --> 11:15.080\n because they were still coming in,\n\n11:15.080 --> 11:16.760\n and I couldn't, I have a job,\n\n11:16.760 --> 11:18.720\n and a house to take care of and stuff.\n\n11:18.720 --> 11:22.680\n So, and then about a week later, I get this other email.\n\n11:22.680 --> 11:27.440\n And he says, he just describes himself,\n\n11:27.440 --> 11:30.200\n like I'm this, I'm this, I'm this, I'm a chef,\n\n11:30.200 --> 11:32.520\n I'm a scientist, I'm a this, I'm a this.\n\n11:32.520 --> 11:36.760\n And so I emailed him back, and I said, you know,\n\n11:36.760 --> 11:38.400\n you seem interesting, you can write me\n\n11:38.400 --> 11:40.840\n at my actual address if you want, here's my address.\n\n11:40.840 --> 11:42.120\n I'm not really responding,\n\n11:42.120 --> 11:43.700\n I'm not really responding to other people anymore,\n\n11:43.700 --> 11:45.040\n but you seem interesting, you know,\n\n11:45.040 --> 11:46.800\n you can write to me if you want.\n\n11:46.800 --> 11:51.800\n And then he wrote to me, and I wrote him back,\n\n11:52.560 --> 11:54.900\n and it was a nondescript kind of email,\n\n11:54.900 --> 11:56.860\n and I wrote him back, and I said, thanks for responding.\n\n11:56.860 --> 11:58.840\n You know, I'm really busy right now.\n\n11:58.840 --> 11:59.720\n I was in the middle of writing\n\n11:59.720 --> 12:02.600\n my first slate of grant applications,\n\n12:02.600 --> 12:04.920\n so I was really consumed, and I said,\n\n12:04.920 --> 12:06.880\n I'll get back to you in a couple of days.\n\n12:06.880 --> 12:09.240\n And so I did, I waited a couple days\n\n12:09.240 --> 12:11.280\n till my grants were, you know, safe,\n\n12:11.280 --> 12:13.440\n grant applications safely out the door.\n\n12:13.440 --> 12:16.960\n And then I emailed him back, and then he emailed me,\n\n12:16.960 --> 12:21.520\n and then really across two days, we sent 100 emails.\n\n12:22.920 --> 12:25.280\n And text only, was there pictures or any of that stuff?\n\n12:25.280 --> 12:27.560\n Text only, text only.\n\n12:27.560 --> 12:30.800\n And then, so this was like a Thursday and a Friday,\n\n12:30.800 --> 12:33.860\n and then Friday, he said,\n\n12:33.860 --> 12:35.660\n let's talk on the weekend on the phone.\n\n12:35.660 --> 12:37.080\n And I said, okay.\n\n12:37.080 --> 12:39.840\n And he wanted to talk Sunday night,\n\n12:39.840 --> 12:42.500\n and I had a date Sunday night.\n\n12:42.500 --> 12:46.760\n So I said, okay, sure, we can talk Sunday night.\n\n12:48.200 --> 12:49.440\n And then I was like, well, you know,\n\n12:49.440 --> 12:50.720\n I don't really wanna cancel my date,\n\n12:50.720 --> 12:52.440\n so I'm just gonna call him on Saturday.\n\n12:52.440 --> 12:55.480\n So I just called, I cold called him on Saturday,\n\n12:55.480 --> 12:57.280\n and a woman answered.\n\n12:57.280 --> 12:58.120\n Oh, wow.\n\n12:59.120 --> 12:59.960\n That's not cool.\n\n12:59.960 --> 13:01.640\n Not cool.\n\n13:01.640 --> 13:04.520\n And so she says, you know, hello.\n\n13:04.520 --> 13:06.880\n And I say, oh, you know, stand there.\n\n13:06.880 --> 13:09.760\n And she said, sure, can I ask who's calling?\n\n13:09.760 --> 13:11.720\n And I said, tell him it's Lisa.\n\n13:11.720 --> 13:14.480\n And she went, oh my God, oh my God, I'm just a friend.\n\n13:14.480 --> 13:15.360\n I'm just a friend.\n\n13:15.360 --> 13:17.760\n I just need to tell you, I'm just a friend.\n\n13:17.760 --> 13:21.280\n And I was like, this is adorable, right?\n\n13:21.280 --> 13:23.120\n She doesn't, and then he gets on the phone,\n\n13:23.120 --> 13:24.480\n not hi, nice to meet you.\n\n13:24.480 --> 13:27.400\n The first thing he says to me, she's just a friend.\n\n13:27.400 --> 13:32.400\n So I was just so charmed really by the whole thing.\n\n13:32.880 --> 13:34.560\n So it was Yom Kippur.\n\n13:34.560 --> 13:38.160\n It was the Jewish day of atonement that was ending\n\n13:38.160 --> 13:40.240\n and they were baking cookies and going to a break fast.\n\n13:40.240 --> 13:42.460\n So people, you know, as you know, fast all day,\n\n13:42.460 --> 13:44.840\n and then they go to a party and they break fast.\n\n13:44.840 --> 13:49.840\n So I thought, okay, I'll just cancel my date.\n\n13:49.840 --> 13:54.840\n So I did, and I stayed home and we talked for eight hours.\n\n13:56.080 --> 13:58.320\n And then the next night for six hours.\n\n13:58.320 --> 14:00.160\n And basically it just went on like that.\n\n14:00.160 --> 14:05.160\n And then by the end of the week, he flew to stay college.\n\n14:06.880 --> 14:08.680\n And, you know, we'd gone through this whole thing\n\n14:08.680 --> 14:10.640\n where I'd said, we're gonna take it slow.\n\n14:10.640 --> 14:12.960\n We're gonna get to know each other, you know.\n\n14:12.960 --> 14:16.080\n And then really by, I think we talked like two or three times\n\n14:16.080 --> 14:18.120\n these like really long conversations.\n\n14:18.120 --> 14:20.280\n And then he said, I'm just gonna fly there.\n\n14:20.280 --> 14:23.720\n And then, so of course there's,\n\n14:23.720 --> 14:26.560\n I don't even know that there were fax machines\n\n14:26.560 --> 14:27.400\n at that point.\n\n14:27.400 --> 14:31.120\n Maybe there were, but I don't think so.\n\n14:31.120 --> 14:34.120\n Anyway, so he, we decided we'll exchange pictures.\n\n14:34.120 --> 14:37.800\n And so he, you know, I take my photograph\n\n14:37.800 --> 14:39.040\n and I give it to my secretary.\n\n14:39.040 --> 14:40.400\n And I say to my secretary.\n\n14:41.720 --> 14:42.560\n Fax this.\n\n14:42.560 --> 14:45.000\n I say that, send this priority mail.\n\n14:45.000 --> 14:45.840\n Priority mail, yeah.\n\n14:45.840 --> 14:47.200\n And he goes, okay, I'll send a priority mail.\n\n14:47.200 --> 14:48.440\n And I'm like, it's a priority mail.\n\n14:48.440 --> 14:50.400\n He's like, I know, priority mail, okay.\n\n14:50.400 --> 14:54.840\n And then, so I get Dan's photograph in the mail.\n\n14:55.880 --> 14:59.640\n And, you know, it's him in shorts.\n\n14:59.640 --> 15:01.760\n And you can see that he's probably somewhere\n\n15:01.760 --> 15:03.480\n like the Bahamas or something like that.\n\n15:03.480 --> 15:05.040\n And it's like cropped.\n\n15:05.040 --> 15:07.440\n So clearly what he's done is he's taken a photograph\n\n15:07.440 --> 15:10.280\n where, you know, he's in it with someone else\n\n15:10.280 --> 15:11.920\n who turned out to be his ex wife.\n\n15:11.920 --> 15:14.080\n So I'm thinking, well, this is awesome.\n\n15:14.080 --> 15:15.480\n You know, I've hit the jackpot.\n\n15:15.480 --> 15:18.640\n He's, you know, very appealing to me, very attractive.\n\n15:18.640 --> 15:23.080\n And then, you know, my photograph doesn't show up\n\n15:23.080 --> 15:24.360\n and it doesn't show up.\n\n15:24.360 --> 15:27.360\n And, you know, so like one day and then two days\n\n15:27.360 --> 15:30.720\n and then, you know, he's like, you know, I said,\n\n15:30.720 --> 15:34.160\n well, I asked my secretary to send a priority.\n\n15:34.160 --> 15:37.240\n I mean, I don't know, you know, what he did.\n\n15:37.240 --> 15:40.960\n And he's like, I said, I'm like, well, you don't have to,\n\n15:40.960 --> 15:41.880\n you know, you don't have to come.\n\n15:41.880 --> 15:43.600\n And he's like, no, no, no, I'm gonna, you know,\n\n15:43.600 --> 15:45.400\n we've had like five dates,\n\n15:45.400 --> 15:47.520\n the equivalent of five dates practically.\n\n15:48.480 --> 15:52.360\n And then, so he's supposed to fly on a Thursday or Friday,\n\n15:52.360 --> 15:53.560\n I can't remember.\n\n15:53.560 --> 15:56.360\n And I get a call like maybe an hour\n\n15:56.360 --> 15:58.120\n before his flight's supposed to leave.\n\n15:58.120 --> 15:59.000\n And he says, hi.\n\n15:59.000 --> 16:00.960\n And I say, and it's just something in his voice, right?\n\n16:00.960 --> 16:03.000\n And I say, cause at this point I think I've talked to him\n\n16:03.000 --> 16:05.400\n like for 25 hours, I don't know.\n\n16:05.400 --> 16:07.280\n And he says, hi.\n\n16:07.280 --> 16:09.280\n And I'm like, you got the picture.\n\n16:09.280 --> 16:10.480\n And he's like, yeah.\n\n16:10.480 --> 16:12.640\n And I'm like, you don't like it.\n\n16:12.640 --> 16:14.800\n And he's like, well,\n\n16:17.120 --> 16:20.040\n I'm sure it's not, I'm sure it's your,\n\n16:20.040 --> 16:21.840\n I'm sure it's just not a good, you know,\n\n16:21.840 --> 16:24.200\n it's not, it's probably not your best.\n\n16:24.200 --> 16:25.200\n Oh no.\n\n16:25.200 --> 16:28.040\n You know, you don't, you don't have to come.\n\n16:28.040 --> 16:29.360\n And he's like, no, no, no, I'm coming.\n\n16:29.360 --> 16:30.640\n And I'm like, no, you don't have to come.\n\n16:30.640 --> 16:32.200\n And he's like, no, no, I really wanna,\n\n16:32.200 --> 16:33.840\n I'm, you know, I'm getting on the plane.\n\n16:33.840 --> 16:35.840\n I'm like, you don't have to get on the plane.\n\n16:36.880 --> 16:38.240\n He's like, no, I'm getting on the plane.\n\n16:38.240 --> 16:40.640\n And so I go down to my, I go,\n\n16:40.640 --> 16:42.040\n I'm in my office, this is happening, right?\n\n16:42.040 --> 16:44.640\n So I go downstairs to one of my closest friends\n\n16:44.640 --> 16:46.960\n who is still actually one of my closest friends,\n\n16:48.600 --> 16:51.240\n who is one of my colleagues and Kevin.\n\n16:51.240 --> 16:53.160\n And I say, Kevin, and I go to Kevin,\n\n16:53.160 --> 16:55.760\n I go, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, he doesn't like the photograph.\n\n16:55.760 --> 16:57.480\n And Kevin's like, well, which photograph should you send?\n\n16:57.480 --> 16:58.880\n And I'm like, well, you know the one\n\n16:58.880 --> 16:59.880\n where we're shooting pool?\n\n16:59.880 --> 17:03.920\n And he's like, you sent that photograph?\n\n17:03.920 --> 17:05.040\n That's a horrible photograph.\n\n17:05.040 --> 17:07.360\n I'm like, yeah, but it's the only one that I had\n\n17:07.360 --> 17:09.600\n that was like, where my hair was kind of similar\n\n17:09.600 --> 17:12.000\n to what it is now, and he's like, Lisa,\n\n17:13.000 --> 17:15.840\n like, do I have to check everything for you?\n\n17:15.840 --> 17:18.440\n You should not have sent that, you know?\n\n17:18.440 --> 17:20.280\n But still, he flew over.\n\n17:20.280 --> 17:22.560\n So he flew. Where from, by the way?\n\n17:22.560 --> 17:25.880\n He was in graduate school at Amherst,\n\n17:25.880 --> 17:27.920\n yeah, at UMass Amherst.\n\n17:27.920 --> 17:32.920\n So he flew and I picked him up at the airport\n\n17:32.920 --> 17:38.880\n and he was happy, so whatever the concern was, was gone.\n\n17:38.880 --> 17:43.080\n And I was dressed, you know, I carefully, carefully dressed.\n\n17:43.080 --> 17:44.120\n Were you nervous?\n\n17:44.120 --> 17:46.280\n I was really, really nervous.\n\n17:46.280 --> 17:49.920\n Because I don't really believe in fate\n\n17:49.920 --> 17:52.360\n and I don't really think there's only one person\n\n17:52.360 --> 17:54.040\n that you can be with.\n\n17:54.040 --> 17:59.040\n But I think some people are curvy,\n\n17:59.040 --> 18:02.880\n you know, people who, some people are curvy,\n\n18:02.880 --> 18:04.280\n they're kind of complicated,\n\n18:04.280 --> 18:06.360\n and so the number of people who fit them\n\n18:06.360 --> 18:08.040\n is maybe less than.\n\n18:08.040 --> 18:10.800\n I like it, mathematically speaking, yeah.\n\n18:10.800 --> 18:13.120\n And so when I was going to pick him up at the airport,\n\n18:13.120 --> 18:15.720\n I was thinking, well, this could,\n\n18:15.720 --> 18:19.080\n I could be going to pick up the person I'm gonna marry.\n\n18:20.280 --> 18:21.480\n Or not.\n\n18:21.480 --> 18:24.680\n I mean, like, I really, but I really, you know,\n\n18:24.680 --> 18:27.800\n like, our conversations were just very authentic\n\n18:27.800 --> 18:32.800\n and very moving and we really connected.\n\n18:33.240 --> 18:37.680\n And I really felt like he understood me, actually,\n\n18:38.960 --> 18:41.640\n in a way that a lot of people don't.\n\n18:41.640 --> 18:46.640\n And what was really nice was, at the time,\n\n18:49.240 --> 18:53.160\n you know, the airport was this tiny little airport\n\n18:53.160 --> 18:54.720\n out in a cornfield, basically.\n\n18:54.720 --> 18:58.440\n And so driving back to the town,\n\n18:58.440 --> 19:00.160\n we were in the car for 15 minutes,\n\n19:00.160 --> 19:02.400\n completely in the dark, as I was driving.\n\n19:02.400 --> 19:04.440\n And so it was very similar to,\n\n19:04.440 --> 19:07.480\n we had just spent, you know, 20 something hours\n\n19:07.480 --> 19:09.960\n on the telephone, sitting in the dark,\n\n19:09.960 --> 19:11.280\n talking to each other.\n\n19:11.280 --> 19:14.480\n So it was very familiar.\n\n19:14.480 --> 19:16.400\n And we basically spent the whole weekend together\n\n19:16.400 --> 19:19.000\n and he met all my friends and we had a big party.\n\n19:19.000 --> 19:22.840\n And at the end of the weekend,\n\n19:22.840 --> 19:26.800\n I said, okay, you know,\n\n19:26.800 --> 19:30.160\n if we're gonna give this a shot,\n\n19:30.160 --> 19:33.120\n we probably shouldn't see other people.\n\n19:33.120 --> 19:35.640\n So it's a risk, you know?\n\n19:35.640 --> 19:36.920\n Commitment.\n\n19:36.920 --> 19:40.160\n But I just didn't see how it would work\n\n19:40.160 --> 19:42.160\n if we were dating people locally\n\n19:42.160 --> 19:44.120\n and then also seeing each other at a distance.\n\n19:44.120 --> 19:46.080\n Because, you know, I've had long distance relationships\n\n19:46.080 --> 19:50.240\n before and they're hard and they take a lot of effort.\n\n19:50.240 --> 19:51.880\n And so we decided we'd give it three months\n\n19:51.880 --> 19:54.560\n and see what happened and that was it.\n\n19:54.560 --> 19:57.200\n This is an interesting thing.\n\n19:57.200 --> 19:58.800\n Like we're all, what is it?\n\n19:58.800 --> 20:00.440\n There's several billion of us\n\n20:00.440 --> 20:02.320\n and we're kind of roaming this world\n\n20:02.320 --> 20:04.400\n and then you kind of stick together.\n\n20:04.400 --> 20:07.640\n You find somebody that just like gets you.\n\n20:07.640 --> 20:09.960\n And it's interesting to think about,\n\n20:09.960 --> 20:12.760\n there's probably thousands if not millions of people\n\n20:12.760 --> 20:14.920\n that would be sticky to you,\n\n20:14.920 --> 20:17.720\n depending on the curvature of your space.\n\n20:17.720 --> 20:22.720\n But what is the, could you speak to the stickiness?\n\n20:23.400 --> 20:25.920\n Like to the, just the falling in love?\n\n20:25.920 --> 20:29.880\n Like seeing that somebody really gets you?\n\n20:29.880 --> 20:34.880\n Maybe by way of telling, do you think,\n\n20:35.200 --> 20:36.360\n do you remember there was a moment\n\n20:36.360 --> 20:40.520\n when you just realized, damn it, I think I'm,\n\n20:40.520 --> 20:42.760\n like I think this is the guy.\n\n20:42.760 --> 20:44.240\n I think I'm in love.\n\n20:44.240 --> 20:46.560\n We were having these conversations actually\n\n20:46.560 --> 20:49.520\n from the, really from the second weekend we were together.\n\n20:49.520 --> 20:51.560\n So he flew back the next weekend to State College\n\n20:51.560 --> 20:52.400\n because it was my birthday.\n\n20:52.400 --> 20:53.240\n It was my 30th birthday.\n\n20:53.240 --> 20:55.200\n My friends were throwing me a party.\n\n20:55.200 --> 20:58.040\n And we went hiking and we hiked up some mountain\n\n20:58.040 --> 21:01.520\n and we were sitting on a cliff over this overlook\n\n21:01.520 --> 21:02.480\n and talking to each other.\n\n21:02.480 --> 21:04.040\n And I was thinking, and I actually said to him,\n\n21:04.040 --> 21:06.880\n like I haven't really known you very long,\n\n21:06.880 --> 21:08.520\n but I feel like I'm falling in love with you,\n\n21:08.520 --> 21:10.160\n which can't possibly be happening.\n\n21:10.160 --> 21:14.800\n I must be projecting, but it certainly feels that way.\n\n21:14.800 --> 21:16.640\n Like I don't believe in love at first sight.\n\n21:16.640 --> 21:18.880\n So this can't really be happening,\n\n21:18.880 --> 21:20.200\n but it sort of feels like it is.\n\n21:20.200 --> 21:21.720\n And he was like, I know what you mean.\n\n21:21.720 --> 21:24.480\n And so for the first three months or four months,\n\n21:24.480 --> 21:25.440\n we would say things to each other.\n\n21:25.440 --> 21:28.080\n Like, I feel like I'm in love with you,\n\n21:28.080 --> 21:32.640\n but you know, but that can't,\n\n21:32.640 --> 21:34.160\n but things don't really work like that.\n\n21:34.160 --> 21:37.040\n So, but you know, so, and then it became a joke.\n\n21:37.040 --> 21:38.520\n Like I feel like I'm in love with you.\n\n21:38.520 --> 21:41.680\n And then eventually, you know, I think,\n\n21:41.680 --> 21:43.280\n but I think that was one moment\n\n21:43.280 --> 21:47.960\n where we were talking about just,\n\n21:50.200 --> 21:53.880\n you know, not just all the great aspirations you have\n\n21:53.880 --> 21:54.720\n or all the things,\n\n21:54.720 --> 21:56.560\n but also things you don't like about yourself,\n\n21:56.560 --> 21:57.920\n things that you're worried about,\n\n21:57.920 --> 21:59.720\n things that you're scared of.\n\n21:59.720 --> 22:03.200\n And then I think that was sort of solidified\n\n22:03.200 --> 22:04.040\n the relationship.\n\n22:04.040 --> 22:06.400\n And then there was one weekend\n\n22:06.400 --> 22:09.120\n where we went to Maine in the winter,\n\n22:09.120 --> 22:12.720\n which I mean, I really love the beach always,\n\n22:12.720 --> 22:15.680\n but in the winter, particularly.\n\n22:15.680 --> 22:18.520\n Because it's just beautiful and calm and whatever.\n\n22:18.520 --> 22:19.360\n Yeah.\n\n22:19.360 --> 22:24.360\n And I also, I do find beauty in starkness sometimes.\n\n22:24.720 --> 22:28.280\n Like, so there's this grand majestic scene\n\n22:28.280 --> 22:30.360\n of, you know, this very powerful ocean\n\n22:30.360 --> 22:33.040\n and it's all these like beautiful blue grays\n\n22:33.040 --> 22:35.680\n and it's just stunning.\n\n22:35.680 --> 22:39.440\n And so we were sitting on this huge rock in Maine\n\n22:39.440 --> 22:40.800\n and where we'd gone for the weekend,\n\n22:40.800 --> 22:42.440\n it was freezing cold.\n\n22:42.440 --> 22:45.880\n And I honestly can't remember what he said\n\n22:45.880 --> 22:48.560\n or what I said or what,\n\n22:48.560 --> 22:52.880\n but I definitely remember having this feeling of,\n\n22:53.840 --> 22:57.160\n I absolutely wanna stay with this person.\n\n22:57.160 --> 22:58.820\n And I don't know what my life will be like\n\n22:58.820 --> 23:00.120\n if I'm not with this person.\n\n23:00.120 --> 23:02.400\n Like I need to be with this person.\n\n23:02.400 --> 23:05.680\n Can we, from a scientific and a human perspective,\n\n23:05.680 --> 23:09.320\n dig into your belief that first love at first sight\n\n23:09.320 --> 23:11.520\n is not possible?\n\n23:11.520 --> 23:13.160\n You don't believe in it?\n\n23:13.160 --> 23:15.800\n Cause there is, you don't think there's like a magic\n\n23:15.800 --> 23:19.680\n where you see somebody in the Jack Kerouac way\n\n23:19.680 --> 23:22.880\n and you're like, wow, that's something.\n\n23:22.880 --> 23:26.760\n That's a special little glimmer or something.\n\n23:26.760 --> 23:29.680\n Oh, I definitely think you can connect with someone\n\n23:29.680 --> 23:32.120\n instant, in an instance.\n\n23:32.120 --> 23:34.720\n And I definitely think you can say,\n\n23:34.720 --> 23:35.760\n oh, there's something there\n\n23:35.760 --> 23:37.740\n and I'm really clicking with that person.\n\n23:37.740 --> 23:39.600\n Romantically, but also just as friends,\n\n23:39.600 --> 23:40.760\n it's possible to do that.\n\n23:40.760 --> 23:44.120\n You recognize a mind that's like yours\n\n23:44.120 --> 23:47.520\n or that's compatible with yours.\n\n23:47.520 --> 23:50.440\n There are ways that you feel like you're being understood\n\n23:50.440 --> 23:52.720\n or that you understand something about this person\n\n23:52.720 --> 23:54.440\n or maybe you see something in this person\n\n23:54.440 --> 23:58.240\n that you find really compelling or intriguing.\n\n23:58.240 --> 24:03.240\n But I think your brain is predictive organ, right?\n\n24:03.360 --> 24:05.480\n You're using your past.\n\n24:05.480 --> 24:06.600\n You're projecting.\n\n24:06.600 --> 24:10.120\n You're using your past to make predictions\n\n24:10.120 --> 24:12.880\n and I mean, not deliberately.\n\n24:12.880 --> 24:14.360\n That's how your brain is wired.\n\n24:14.360 --> 24:15.280\n That's what it does.\n\n24:15.280 --> 24:20.200\n And so it's filling in all of the gaps that you,\n\n24:21.200 --> 24:23.120\n there are lots of gaps of information\n\n24:23.120 --> 24:26.280\n that you don't, information you don't have.\n\n24:26.280 --> 24:28.780\n And so your brain is filling those in and.\n\n24:31.400 --> 24:32.600\n But isn't that what love is?\n\n24:32.600 --> 24:35.160\n No, I don't think so, actually.\n\n24:35.160 --> 24:38.360\n I mean, to some extent, sure, you always,\n\n24:38.360 --> 24:41.640\n there's research to show that people who are in love\n\n24:41.640 --> 24:43.800\n always see the best in each other\n\n24:43.800 --> 24:48.300\n and when there's a negative interpretation\n\n24:48.300 --> 24:49.640\n or a positive interpretation,\n\n24:49.640 --> 24:50.820\n they choose the positive ones.\n\n24:50.820 --> 24:54.080\n There's a little bit of positive illusion there going on.\n\n24:54.080 --> 24:55.540\n That's what the research shows.\n\n24:55.540 --> 25:00.540\n But I think that when you find somebody\n\n25:00.540 --> 25:05.540\n when you find somebody who not just appreciates\n\n25:07.900 --> 25:12.900\n your faults but loves you for them actually,\n\n25:13.100 --> 25:16.620\n like maybe even doesn't see them as a fault,\n\n25:16.620 --> 25:20.540\n that's, so you have to be honest enough\n\n25:20.540 --> 25:24.020\n about what your faults are.\n\n25:24.020 --> 25:26.060\n So it's easy to love someone for all the things\n\n25:26.060 --> 25:31.060\n that they, for all the wonderful characteristics they have.\n\n25:34.080 --> 25:37.940\n It's harder, I think, to love someone despite their faults\n\n25:37.940 --> 25:39.820\n or maybe even the faults that they see\n\n25:39.820 --> 25:41.140\n aren't really faults at all to you.\n\n25:41.140 --> 25:43.860\n They're actually something really special.\n\n25:43.860 --> 25:45.700\n But isn't that, can't you explain that\n\n25:45.700 --> 25:48.780\n by saying the brain kind of, like you're projecting,\n\n25:50.780 --> 25:54.300\n you have a conception of a human being\n\n25:54.300 --> 25:58.100\n or just a spirit that really connects with you\n\n25:58.100 --> 26:01.220\n and you're projecting that onto that person\n\n26:01.220 --> 26:04.820\n and within that framework, all their faults\n\n26:04.820 --> 26:06.420\n then become beautiful, like little.\n\n26:06.420 --> 26:09.140\n Maybe, but you just have to pay attention\n\n26:09.140 --> 26:10.380\n to the prediction error.\n\n26:11.540 --> 26:13.700\n No, but maybe that's what love,\n\n26:13.700 --> 26:17.620\n like maybe you started ignoring the prediction error.\n\n26:17.620 --> 26:21.220\n Maybe love is just your ability, like.\n\n26:21.220 --> 26:22.780\n To ignore the prediction error.\n\n26:22.780 --> 26:24.900\n Well, I think that there's some research\n\n26:24.900 --> 26:29.900\n that might say that, but that's not my experience, I guess.\n\n26:30.340 --> 26:31.940\n But there is some research that says,\n\n26:31.940 --> 26:33.260\n I mean, there's some research that says\n\n26:33.260 --> 26:35.780\n you have to have an optimal margin of illusion,\n\n26:35.780 --> 26:40.780\n which means that you put a positive spin on smaller things,\n\n26:42.500 --> 26:45.100\n but you don't ignore the bigger things, right?\n\n26:45.100 --> 26:48.380\n And I think without being judgmental at all,\n\n26:48.380 --> 26:52.740\n when someone says to me, you're not who I thought you were,\n\n26:52.740 --> 26:55.060\n I mean, nobody has said that to me in a really long time,\n\n26:55.060 --> 26:56.580\n but certainly when I was younger,\n\n26:56.580 --> 26:58.540\n that was, you're not who I thought you were.\n\n26:58.540 --> 27:01.460\n My reaction to that was, well, whose fault is that?\n\n27:01.460 --> 27:06.460\n You know, I'm a pretty upfront person.\n\n27:08.140 --> 27:11.820\n I mean, I will though say that in my experience,\n\n27:11.820 --> 27:15.860\n people don't lie to you about who they are.\n\n27:15.860 --> 27:18.420\n They lie to themselves in your presence.\n\n27:18.420 --> 27:23.420\n And so, you know, you don't wanna get tied up in that,\n\n27:29.140 --> 27:30.260\n tangled up in that.\n\n27:30.260 --> 27:32.500\n And I think from the get go,\n\n27:32.500 --> 27:34.420\n Dan and I were just for whatever reason,\n\n27:34.420 --> 27:36.220\n maybe it's because we both had been divorced already\n\n27:36.220 --> 27:41.220\n and, you know, he told me who we thought he was\n\n27:44.380 --> 27:47.380\n and he was pretty accurate as far as I could,\n\n27:47.380 --> 27:48.540\n pretty much actually.\n\n27:48.540 --> 27:50.180\n I mean, there's very,\n\n27:51.420 --> 27:54.780\n I can't say that I've ever come across a characteristic\n\n27:54.780 --> 27:58.460\n in him that really surprised me in a bad way.\n\n27:58.460 --> 28:00.380\n It's hard to know yourself.\n\n28:00.380 --> 28:01.220\n It is hard to know yourself.\n\n28:01.220 --> 28:02.580\n And to communicate that.\n\n28:02.580 --> 28:03.420\n For sure.\n\n28:03.420 --> 28:05.460\n I mean, I'll say, you know,\n\n28:05.460 --> 28:08.420\n I had the advantage of training as a therapist,\n\n28:08.420 --> 28:11.660\n which meant for five years I was under a fucking microscope.\n\n28:11.660 --> 28:12.500\n Yeah.\n\n28:12.500 --> 28:14.820\n You know, when I was training as a therapist,\n\n28:14.820 --> 28:17.020\n it was hour for hour supervision,\n\n28:17.020 --> 28:20.580\n which meant if you were in a room with a client for an hour,\n\n28:20.580 --> 28:23.860\n you had an hour with a supervisor.\n\n28:23.860 --> 28:28.300\n So that supervisor was behind the mirror for your session.\n\n28:28.300 --> 28:30.660\n And then you went and had an hour of discussion\n\n28:30.660 --> 28:33.140\n about what you said, what you didn't say,\n\n28:33.140 --> 28:37.860\n learning to use your own feelings and thoughts\n\n28:37.860 --> 28:42.220\n as a tool to probe the mind of the client and so on.\n\n28:42.220 --> 28:45.660\n And so you can't help but learn a lot of,\n\n28:45.660 --> 28:47.700\n you can't help but learn a lot about yourself\n\n28:47.700 --> 28:48.860\n in that process.\n\n28:48.860 --> 28:53.860\n Do you think knowing or learning how the sausage is made\n\n28:55.260 --> 28:58.100\n ruins the magic of the actual experience?\n\n28:58.100 --> 29:01.540\n Like you as a neuroscientist who studies the brain,\n\n29:01.540 --> 29:05.900\n do you think it ruins the magic of like love at first sight?\n\n29:05.900 --> 29:09.180\n Or are you, do you consciously are still able\n\n29:09.180 --> 29:11.260\n to lose yourself in the moment?\n\n29:11.260 --> 29:13.620\n I'm definitely able to lose myself in the moment.\n\n29:13.620 --> 29:14.740\n Is wine involved?\n\n29:14.740 --> 29:17.340\n Not always, chocolate.\n\n29:17.340 --> 29:20.220\n I mean, some kind of mind altering substance, right?\n\n29:20.220 --> 29:23.100\n But yeah, for sure.\n\n29:23.100 --> 29:24.620\n I mean, I guess what I would say though,\n\n29:24.620 --> 29:29.620\n is that for me, part of the magic is the process.\n\n29:31.140 --> 29:35.140\n Like, so I remember a day there was,\n\n29:35.140 --> 29:38.220\n while I was working on this book of essays,\n\n29:38.220 --> 29:39.780\n I was in New York.\n\n29:41.300 --> 29:42.780\n I can't remember why I was in New York,\n\n29:42.780 --> 29:44.660\n but I was in New York for something.\n\n29:44.660 --> 29:47.940\n And I was in Central Park and I was looking\n\n29:47.940 --> 29:50.380\n at all the people with their babies.\n\n29:50.380 --> 29:54.860\n And I was thinking, each one of these,\n\n29:54.860 --> 29:59.860\n there's a tiny little brain that's wiring itself right now.\n\n30:00.180 --> 30:03.580\n And I just, I felt in that moment,\n\n30:03.580 --> 30:06.020\n I was like, I am never gonna look at an infant\n\n30:06.020 --> 30:08.340\n in the same way ever again.\n\n30:08.340 --> 30:11.220\n And so to me, I mean, honestly,\n\n30:11.220 --> 30:14.340\n before I started learning about brain development,\n\n30:14.340 --> 30:17.780\n I thought babies were cute, but not that interesting\n\n30:17.780 --> 30:21.380\n until they could do interact with you and do things.\n\n30:21.380 --> 30:22.820\n Of course, my own infant, I thought,\n\n30:22.820 --> 30:24.360\n was extraordinarily interesting,\n\n30:24.360 --> 30:27.140\n but they're kind of like lumps.\n\n30:27.140 --> 30:29.980\n That's until they can interact with you,\n\n30:29.980 --> 30:31.600\n but they are anything but lumps.\n\n30:31.600 --> 30:34.960\n I mean, so, and part of the,\n\n30:35.860 --> 30:38.940\n I mean, all I can say is I have deep affection now\n\n30:38.940 --> 30:41.600\n for like tiny little babies in a way\n\n30:41.600 --> 30:45.460\n that I didn't really before\n\n30:46.580 --> 30:51.580\n because of the, I'm just so curious.\n\n30:51.740 --> 30:53.620\n But the actual process of the mechanisms\n\n30:53.620 --> 30:56.480\n of the wiring of the brain, the learning,\n\n30:56.480 --> 30:58.340\n all the magic of the neurobiology.\n\n30:58.340 --> 31:01.080\n Yeah, and or something like,\n\n31:03.080 --> 31:05.940\n when you make eye contact with someone directly,\n\n31:05.940 --> 31:10.940\n sometimes you feel something, right?\n\n31:10.940 --> 31:13.260\n Yeah, that's weird.\n\n31:13.260 --> 31:14.420\n What is it?\n\n31:14.420 --> 31:15.760\n And what is that?\n\n31:15.760 --> 31:20.220\n And so to me, that's not backing away from the moment.\n\n31:20.220 --> 31:22.020\n That's like expanding the moment.\n\n31:22.020 --> 31:24.940\n It's like, that's incredibly cool.\n\n31:24.940 --> 31:27.320\n You know, when I was, I'll just say that\n\n31:27.320 --> 31:30.420\n when I was in graduate school,\n\n31:30.420 --> 31:34.780\n I also was in therapy because it's almost a given\n\n31:34.780 --> 31:36.900\n that you're gonna be in therapy yourself\n\n31:36.900 --> 31:38.380\n if you're gonna become a therapist.\n\n31:38.380 --> 31:41.980\n And I had a deal with my therapist,\n\n31:41.980 --> 31:44.100\n which was that I could call timeout\n\n31:44.100 --> 31:46.140\n at any moment that I wanted to,\n\n31:46.140 --> 31:48.220\n as long as I was being responsible about it.\n\n31:48.220 --> 31:50.640\n And I wasn't using it as a way to get out of something.\n\n31:50.640 --> 31:54.340\n And he could tell me, no, he could decline and say,\n\n31:54.340 --> 31:56.940\n no, you're using this to get out of something.\n\n31:56.940 --> 31:58.940\n But I could call timeout whenever I want\n\n31:58.940 --> 32:00.460\n and say, what are you doing right now?\n\n32:00.460 --> 32:02.360\n Like, what are you, here's what I'm experiencing.\n\n32:02.360 --> 32:03.580\n What are you trying to do?\n\n32:03.580 --> 32:06.340\n Like I wanted to use my own experience\n\n32:06.340 --> 32:10.880\n to interrogate what the process was.\n\n32:10.880 --> 32:14.880\n And that made it more helpful in a way.\n\n32:18.020 --> 32:18.860\n Do you know what I mean?\n\n32:18.860 --> 32:21.600\n So yeah, I don't think learning how something works\n\n32:21.600 --> 32:23.400\n makes it less magical actually,\n\n32:23.400 --> 32:25.340\n but that's just me, I guess.\n\n32:25.340 --> 32:26.540\n I don't know, would you?\n\n32:27.780 --> 32:28.620\n Yes.\n\n32:29.620 --> 32:32.100\n I tend to have two modes.\n\n32:32.100 --> 32:35.580\n One is an engineer and one is a romantic.\n\n32:35.580 --> 32:40.580\n And I'm conscious of like, there's two rooms.\n\n32:41.340 --> 32:43.700\n You can go into the one, the engineer room.\n\n32:43.700 --> 32:45.820\n And I think that ruins the romance.\n\n32:45.820 --> 32:48.540\n So I tend to, there's two rooms.\n\n32:48.540 --> 32:50.420\n One is the engineering room.\n\n32:50.420 --> 32:53.400\n Think from first principles, how do we build the thing\n\n32:53.400 --> 32:55.940\n that creates this kind of behavior?\n\n32:55.940 --> 32:57.980\n And then you go into the romantic room\n\n32:57.980 --> 33:00.180\n where you're like emotional, it's a roller coaster.\n\n33:00.180 --> 33:03.900\n And then the thing is, let's take it slow.\n\n33:03.900 --> 33:05.900\n And then you get married the next night\n\n33:05.900 --> 33:08.660\n that you just this giant mess and you write a song\n\n33:08.660 --> 33:12.180\n and then you cry and then you send a bunch of texts\n\n33:12.180 --> 33:14.180\n and anger and whatever.\n\n33:14.180 --> 33:17.180\n And somehow you're in Vegas and there's random people\n\n33:17.180 --> 33:18.760\n and you're drunk and whatever, all that,\n\n33:18.760 --> 33:21.900\n like in poetry and just mess of it, fighting.\n\n33:21.900 --> 33:24.860\n Yeah, that's not, those are two rooms\n\n33:24.860 --> 33:27.020\n and you go back between them.\n\n33:27.020 --> 33:29.600\n But I think the way you put it is quite poetic.\n\n33:29.600 --> 33:32.900\n I think you're much better at adulting\n\n33:32.900 --> 33:37.580\n with love than perhaps I am.\n\n33:37.580 --> 33:40.180\n Because there's a magic to children.\n\n33:40.180 --> 33:45.180\n I also think like of adults as children.\n\n33:45.740 --> 33:48.640\n It's kind of cool to see, it's a cool thought experiment\n\n33:48.640 --> 33:53.300\n to look at adults and think like that used to be a baby.\n\n33:53.300 --> 33:56.260\n And then that's like a fully wired baby.\n\n33:56.260 --> 33:58.500\n And it's just walking around pretending to be like\n\n33:58.500 --> 34:01.820\n all serious and important, wearing a suit or something.\n\n34:01.820 --> 34:03.660\n But that used to be a baby.\n\n34:03.660 --> 34:05.460\n And then you think of like the parenting\n\n34:05.460 --> 34:07.500\n and all the experiences they had.\n\n34:07.500 --> 34:09.900\n Like it's cool to think of it that way.\n\n34:09.900 --> 34:11.420\n But then I start thinking like\n\n34:11.420 --> 34:13.460\n from a machine learning perspective.\n\n34:13.460 --> 34:16.260\n But once you're like the romantic moments,\n\n34:16.260 --> 34:19.080\n all that kind of stuff, all that falls away.\n\n34:19.080 --> 34:21.580\n I forget about all of that, I don't know.\n\n34:21.580 --> 34:23.420\n That's the Russian thing.\n\n34:23.420 --> 34:24.700\n Maybe, maybe.\n\n34:24.700 --> 34:26.460\n But I also think it might be an age thing\n\n34:26.460 --> 34:28.060\n or maybe an experience thing.\n\n34:28.060 --> 34:33.020\n So I think we all, I mean,\n\n34:33.020 --> 34:35.300\n if you're exposed to Western culture at all,\n\n34:35.300 --> 34:40.020\n you are exposed to the sort of idealized,\n\n34:40.020 --> 34:45.020\n stereotypic, romantic exchange.\n\n34:45.620 --> 34:48.060\n And what does it mean to be romantic?\n\n34:48.060 --> 34:50.120\n And so here's a test.\n\n34:53.640 --> 34:55.000\n I'm seeing how to phrase it.\n\n34:55.000 --> 34:56.980\n Okay, so not really a test,\n\n34:56.980 --> 34:58.740\n but this tells you something about\n\n34:58.740 --> 35:00.400\n your own ideas about romance.\n\n35:03.780 --> 35:06.380\n For Valentine's Day one year,\n\n35:06.380 --> 35:09.780\n my husband bought me a six way plug.\n\n35:10.740 --> 35:12.900\n Is that romantic or not romantic?\n\n35:14.980 --> 35:17.980\n Like, sorry, six way plug, is that like an outlet?\n\n35:17.980 --> 35:19.460\n Yeah, like to put it in an outlet.\n\n35:19.460 --> 35:21.620\n Is that romantic or not romantic?\n\n35:21.620 --> 35:26.620\n I mean, it depends the look in his eyes when he does it.\n\n35:28.020 --> 35:31.540\n I mean, it depends on the conversation\n\n35:31.540 --> 35:33.780\n that led up to that point.\n\n35:33.780 --> 35:38.140\n Depends how much, it's like the music,\n\n35:38.140 --> 35:42.060\n because you have a very, you're both from the,\n\n35:42.060 --> 35:44.300\n my experiences with you as a fan,\n\n35:44.300 --> 35:45.700\n you have both a romantic niche,\n\n35:45.700 --> 35:46.980\n but you have a very pragmatic,\n\n35:46.980 --> 35:51.260\n like you cut through the bullshit of the fuzziness.\n\n35:51.260 --> 35:53.300\n And there's something about a six way plug\n\n35:53.300 --> 35:54.380\n that cuts through the bullshit\n\n35:54.380 --> 35:55.380\n that connects to the human,\n\n35:55.380 --> 35:57.380\n like he understands who you are.\n\n35:57.380 --> 36:00.500\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n36:00.500 --> 36:03.120\n That was the most romantic gift he could have given me\n\n36:03.120 --> 36:05.980\n because he knows me so well.\n\n36:05.980 --> 36:08.020\n He has a deep understanding of me,\n\n36:08.020 --> 36:12.180\n which is that I will sit and suffer and complain\n\n36:12.180 --> 36:15.580\n about the fact that I have to plug and unplug things.\n\n36:15.580 --> 36:17.940\n And I will bitch and moan until the cows come home,\n\n36:17.940 --> 36:21.300\n but it would never occur to me to go buy\n\n36:21.300 --> 36:23.380\n a bloody six way plug.\n\n36:23.380 --> 36:27.120\n Whereas for him, he bought it, he plugged it in,\n\n36:27.120 --> 36:29.340\n he arranged, he taped up all my wires,\n\n36:29.340 --> 36:31.980\n he made it like really usable.\n\n36:31.980 --> 36:36.980\n And for me, that was the best present.\n\n36:38.300 --> 36:40.500\n It was the most romantic thing\n\n36:40.500 --> 36:43.600\n because he understood who I was\n\n36:43.600 --> 36:45.060\n and he did something very,\n\n36:45.060 --> 36:49.360\n or just the casual, like we moved into a house\n\n36:49.360 --> 36:51.400\n that we went from having a two car garage\n\n36:51.400 --> 36:52.920\n to a one car garage.\n\n36:52.920 --> 36:54.640\n And I said, okay, I'm from Canada,\n\n36:54.640 --> 36:56.020\n I'm not bothered by snow.\n\n36:56.020 --> 36:57.620\n Well, I mean, I'm a little bothered by snow,\n\n36:57.620 --> 36:59.240\n but he's very bothered by snow.\n\n36:59.240 --> 37:01.820\n So I'm like, okay, you can park your car in the garage,\n\n37:01.820 --> 37:03.280\n it's fine.\n\n37:03.280 --> 37:06.500\n Every day when it snows, he goes out and cleans my car.\n\n37:06.500 --> 37:07.340\n Every day.\n\n37:08.980 --> 37:12.060\n I never asked him to do it, he just does it\n\n37:12.060 --> 37:15.240\n because he knows that I'm cutting it really close\n\n37:15.240 --> 37:17.900\n in the morning, when we all used to go to work.\n\n37:18.780 --> 37:20.860\n I have a time to the second\n\n37:20.860 --> 37:23.460\n so that I can get up as late as possible,\n\n37:23.460 --> 37:25.980\n work out as long as possible,\n\n37:25.980 --> 37:27.460\n and make it into my office\n\n37:27.460 --> 37:29.220\n like a minute before my first meeting.\n\n37:29.220 --> 37:31.660\n And so if it snows unexpectedly or something,\n\n37:31.660 --> 37:35.180\n I'm screwed because now that's an added 10 or 15 minutes\n\n37:35.180 --> 37:36.740\n and I'm gonna be late.\n\n37:36.740 --> 37:39.340\n Anyways, it's just these little tiny things.\n\n37:39.340 --> 37:43.620\n He's a really easygoing guy\n\n37:43.620 --> 37:45.340\n and he doesn't look like somebody\n\n37:45.340 --> 37:47.360\n who pays attention to detail.\n\n37:48.340 --> 37:50.500\n He doesn't fuss about detail,\n\n37:50.500 --> 37:53.140\n but he definitely pays attention to detail.\n\n37:53.140 --> 37:56.940\n And it is very, very romantic in the sense\n\n37:56.940 --> 38:01.940\n that he loves me despite my little details.\n\n38:04.620 --> 38:05.820\n And understands you.\n\n38:05.820 --> 38:06.660\n Yeah, he understands me.\n\n38:06.660 --> 38:09.540\n It is kind of hilarious that that is,\n\n38:09.540 --> 38:14.540\n the six way plug is the most fulfilling,\n\n38:14.940 --> 38:19.220\n richest display of romance in your life.\n\n38:19.220 --> 38:20.060\n I love it.\n\n38:20.060 --> 38:20.880\n I love it.\n\n38:20.880 --> 38:21.720\n That's what I mean about romance.\n\n38:21.720 --> 38:23.700\n Romance is really, it's not all about chocolates\n\n38:23.700 --> 38:25.500\n and flowers and whatever.\n\n38:25.500 --> 38:28.220\n I mean, those are all nice too, but...\n\n38:28.220 --> 38:29.820\n Sometimes it's about the six way plug.\n\n38:29.820 --> 38:32.260\n Sometimes it's about the six way plug.\n\n38:32.260 --> 38:35.500\n So maybe one way I could ask\n\n38:35.500 --> 38:36.700\n before we talk about the details,\n\n38:36.700 --> 38:38.540\n you also have the author of another book\n\n38:38.540 --> 38:41.300\n as we talked about how emotions are made.\n\n38:41.300 --> 38:44.020\n So it's interesting to talk about the process of writing.\n\n38:44.020 --> 38:46.020\n You mentioned you were in New York.\n\n38:46.020 --> 38:48.180\n What have you learned from writing these two books\n\n38:48.180 --> 38:50.300\n about the actual process of writing?\n\n38:50.300 --> 38:53.420\n And maybe, I don't know what's the most interesting thing\n\n38:53.420 --> 38:54.260\n to talk about there.\n\n38:54.260 --> 38:55.860\n Maybe the biggest challenges\n\n38:55.860 --> 38:58.340\n or the boring, mundane, systematic,\n\n38:58.340 --> 39:00.380\n like day to day of what worked for you,\n\n39:00.380 --> 39:04.060\n like hacks or even just about the neuroscience\n\n39:04.060 --> 39:07.000\n that you've learned through the process\n\n39:07.000 --> 39:08.380\n of trying to write them.\n\n39:08.380 --> 39:09.680\n Here's the thing I learned.\n\n39:09.680 --> 39:11.760\n If you think that it's gonna take you a year\n\n39:11.760 --> 39:12.660\n to write your book,\n\n39:12.660 --> 39:15.260\n it's going to take you three years to write your book.\n\n39:15.260 --> 39:17.120\n That's the first thing I learned\n\n39:17.120 --> 39:22.120\n is that no matter how organized you are,\n\n39:22.560 --> 39:27.560\n it's always gonna take way longer than what you think\n\n39:28.740 --> 39:33.740\n in part because very few people make an outline\n\n39:33.740 --> 39:35.100\n and then just stick to it.\n\n39:36.740 --> 39:39.020\n Some of the topics really take on a life of their own\n\n39:39.020 --> 39:43.740\n and to some extent you wanna let them have their voice.\n\n39:43.740 --> 39:46.960\n You wanna follow leads until you feel satisfied\n\n39:46.960 --> 39:51.960\n that you've dealt with the topic appropriately.\n\n39:52.060 --> 39:54.460\n But that part is actually fun.\n\n39:54.460 --> 39:57.420\n It's not fun to feel like you're constantly behind the eight\n\n39:57.420 --> 39:59.460\n ball in terms of time.\n\n39:59.460 --> 40:02.860\n But it is the exploration and the foraging for information\n\n40:02.860 --> 40:05.020\n is incredibly fun.\n\n40:05.020 --> 40:07.020\n For me anyways, I found it really enjoyable.\n\n40:07.020 --> 40:09.180\n And if I wasn't also running a lab at the same time\n\n40:09.180 --> 40:12.020\n and trying to keep my family going,\n\n40:13.240 --> 40:15.900\n the whole thing would have just been fun.\n\n40:15.900 --> 40:18.420\n But I would say the hardest thing about,\n\n40:18.420 --> 40:20.180\n the most important thing I think I learned\n\n40:20.180 --> 40:22.180\n is also the hardest thing and that for me,\n\n40:22.180 --> 40:27.180\n which is knowing what to leave out.\n\n40:27.740 --> 40:32.500\n A really good storyteller knows what to leave out.\n\n40:32.500 --> 40:37.500\n In academic writing, you shouldn't leave anything out.\n\n40:38.760 --> 40:40.440\n All the details should be there.\n\n40:45.380 --> 40:49.880\n I've written or participated in writing\n\n40:50.820 --> 40:54.620\n over 200 papers, peer reviewed papers.\n\n40:54.620 --> 40:57.660\n So I'm pretty good with detail.\n\n40:57.660 --> 41:01.940\n Knowing what to leave out and not harming\n\n41:01.940 --> 41:04.140\n the validity of the story.\n\n41:04.140 --> 41:06.820\n That is a tricky, tricky thing.\n\n41:06.820 --> 41:10.180\n It was tricky when I wrote How Emotions Are Made,\n\n41:10.180 --> 41:13.780\n but that's a standard popular science book.\n\n41:13.780 --> 41:15.420\n So it's 300 something pages.\n\n41:15.420 --> 41:18.300\n And then it has like a thousand end notes.\n\n41:18.300 --> 41:22.420\n And then each of the end notes is attached to a web note,\n\n41:22.420 --> 41:23.960\n which is also long.\n\n41:23.960 --> 41:28.960\n So I mean, it's, and it start, and I mean the final draft,\n\n41:28.960 --> 41:33.600\n I mean, I wrote three drafts of that book actually.\n\n41:33.600 --> 41:36.960\n And the final draft, and then I had to cut by a third.\n\n41:36.960 --> 41:41.960\n I mean, it was like 150,000 words or something.\n\n41:42.520 --> 41:44.960\n And I had to cut it down to like 110.\n\n41:44.960 --> 41:49.240\n So obviously it's, I struggle with what to leave out.\n\n41:49.240 --> 41:50.520\n Brevity is not my strong suit.\n\n41:50.520 --> 41:52.840\n I'm always telling people that it's a warning.\n\n41:52.840 --> 41:55.120\n So that's why this book was,\n\n41:55.120 --> 41:58.280\n I'd always been really fascinated with essays.\n\n41:58.280 --> 41:59.960\n I love reading essays.\n\n41:59.960 --> 42:04.960\n And after reading a small set of essays by Anne Fadiman\n\n42:05.960 --> 42:07.800\n called At Large and At Small,\n\n42:07.800 --> 42:10.280\n which I just love these little essays.\n\n42:10.280 --> 42:12.280\n What's the topic of those essays?\n\n42:12.280 --> 42:15.280\n They are, they're called familiar essays.\n\n42:15.280 --> 42:18.240\n So the topics are like everyday topics,\n\n42:18.240 --> 42:22.160\n like mail, coffee, chocolate.\n\n42:22.160 --> 42:23.960\n I mean, just like, and what she does\n\n42:23.960 --> 42:26.160\n is she weaves her own experience.\n\n42:26.160 --> 42:28.060\n It's a little bit like these conversations\n\n42:28.060 --> 42:30.560\n that you're so good at curating, actually.\n\n42:32.060 --> 42:36.240\n You're weaving together history and philosophy and science\n\n42:36.240 --> 42:38.560\n and also personal reflections.\n\n42:38.560 --> 42:43.560\n And a little bit, you feel like you're like eavesdropping\n\n42:44.760 --> 42:47.640\n on someone's train of thought in a way.\n\n42:47.640 --> 42:51.560\n It's really, they're really compelling to me.\n\n42:51.560 --> 42:53.320\n Even if it's just a mundane topic.\n\n42:53.320 --> 42:55.280\n Yeah, but it's so interesting\n\n42:55.280 --> 43:00.280\n to learn about like all of these little stories\n\n43:02.760 --> 43:07.760\n in the wrapping of the history of like mail.\n\n43:08.080 --> 43:10.080\n Like that's really interesting.\n\n43:10.080 --> 43:12.000\n And so I read these essays\n\n43:12.000 --> 43:15.400\n and then I wrote to her a little fan girl email.\n\n43:15.400 --> 43:16.940\n This was many years ago.\n\n43:16.940 --> 43:21.700\n And I said, I just love this book.\n\n43:21.700 --> 43:23.760\n And how did you learn to write essays like this?\n\n43:23.760 --> 43:26.000\n And she gave me a reading list of essays\n\n43:26.000 --> 43:27.640\n that I should read like writers.\n\n43:27.640 --> 43:28.980\n And so I read them all.\n\n43:28.980 --> 43:33.600\n And anyway, so I decided it would be a really good challenge\n\n43:33.600 --> 43:37.160\n for me to try to write something really brief\n\n43:37.160 --> 43:42.160\n where I could focus on one or two really fascinating tidbits\n\n43:45.360 --> 43:50.200\n of neuroscience, connect each one\n\n43:50.200 --> 43:54.800\n to something philosophical or like just a question\n\n43:54.800 --> 43:56.560\n about human nature.\n\n43:56.560 --> 43:58.680\n Do it in a really brief format\n\n43:58.680 --> 44:03.680\n without violating the validity of the science.\n\n44:05.160 --> 44:07.240\n That was a, I just set myself this,\n\n44:07.240 --> 44:09.480\n what I thought of as a really, really big challenge\n\n44:09.480 --> 44:11.480\n in part because it was an incredibly hard thing\n\n44:11.480 --> 44:13.340\n for me to do in the first book.\n\n44:13.340 --> 44:15.520\n Yeah, we should say that this is,\n\n44:15.520 --> 44:17.960\n The Seven and a Half Lessons is a very short book.\n\n44:17.960 --> 44:22.840\n I mean, it's like it embodies brevity, right?\n\n44:22.840 --> 44:25.680\n The whole point throughout is just,\n\n44:25.680 --> 44:27.920\n I mean, you could tell that there's editing,\n\n44:27.920 --> 44:31.200\n like there's pain in trying to bring it\n\n44:31.200 --> 44:35.040\n as brief as possible, as clean as possible, yeah.\n\n44:35.040 --> 44:37.880\n Yeah, so it's, the way I think of it is,\n\n44:37.880 --> 44:41.400\n it's a little book of big science and big ideas.\n\n44:41.400 --> 44:44.960\n Yeah, really big ideas in brief little packages.\n\n44:44.960 --> 44:49.840\n And I wrote it so that people could read it.\n\n44:49.840 --> 44:51.800\n I love reading on the beach.\n\n44:51.800 --> 44:53.520\n I love reading essays on the beach.\n\n44:53.520 --> 44:55.880\n I read it, I wrote it so people could read it on the beach\n\n44:55.880 --> 44:58.920\n or in the bathtub or a subway stop.\n\n44:58.920 --> 45:02.080\n Even if the beach is frozen over in the snow.\n\n45:02.080 --> 45:04.700\n Yeah, so my husband, Dan, calls it\n\n45:04.700 --> 45:06.720\n the first neuroscience beach read.\n\n45:06.720 --> 45:10.040\n That's his phrasing, yeah.\n\n45:11.000 --> 45:13.360\n And like you said, you learn a lot about writing\n\n45:13.360 --> 45:15.280\n from your husband, like you were saying offline.\n\n45:15.280 --> 45:20.280\n Well, he is, of the two of us, he is the better writer.\n\n45:20.300 --> 45:22.280\n He is a masterful writer.\n\n45:24.800 --> 45:28.760\n He's also, I mean, he's a PhD in computer science.\n\n45:28.760 --> 45:29.960\n He's a software engineer,\n\n45:29.960 --> 45:34.960\n but he's also really good at organization of knowledge.\n\n45:36.480 --> 45:38.840\n So he built for a company he used to work for,\n\n45:38.840 --> 45:41.680\n he built one of the first knowledge management systems.\n\n45:41.680 --> 45:44.200\n And he now works at Google\n\n45:44.200 --> 45:46.560\n where he does engineering education.\n\n45:46.560 --> 45:50.140\n Like he understands how to tell a good story,\n\n45:51.540 --> 45:54.760\n just about anything, really.\n\n45:55.680 --> 45:59.120\n He's got impeccable timing, he's really funny.\n\n45:59.120 --> 46:01.720\n And luckily for me, he knows very little\n\n46:01.720 --> 46:03.560\n about psychology or neuroscience.\n\n46:03.560 --> 46:05.720\n Well, now he knows more, obviously, but.\n\n46:05.720 --> 46:10.720\n So when How Emotions Were Made, he was really, really helpful\n\n46:13.600 --> 46:17.200\n to me because the first draft of every chapter\n\n46:17.200 --> 46:19.780\n was me talking to him about what,\n\n46:19.780 --> 46:22.560\n I would talk out loud about what I wanted to say\n\n46:22.560 --> 46:24.840\n and the order in which I wanted to say it.\n\n46:24.840 --> 46:28.880\n And then I would write it and then he would read it\n\n46:28.880 --> 46:32.080\n and tell me all the bits that could be excised.\n\n46:33.200 --> 46:35.520\n And sometimes we would, I should say,\n\n46:35.520 --> 46:39.080\n I mean, we don't, he and I don't really argue about much\n\n46:39.080 --> 46:41.440\n except directions in the car.\n\n46:41.440 --> 46:44.280\n Like if we're gonna have an argument,\n\n46:44.280 --> 46:46.200\n that's gonna be where it's gonna happen, where.\n\n46:46.200 --> 46:50.000\n What's the nature of the argument about directions exactly?\n\n46:50.000 --> 46:52.520\n I don't really know, it's just that we're very,\n\n46:52.520 --> 46:54.240\n I think it's that spatially,\n\n46:56.600 --> 46:58.700\n I use egocentric space.\n\n46:58.700 --> 47:01.400\n So I wanna say, turn left.\n\n47:01.400 --> 47:03.880\n Like I'm reasoning in relation\n\n47:03.880 --> 47:06.640\n to my own physical corporeal body.\n\n47:06.640 --> 47:10.000\n So you walk to the church and you turn left and you,\n\n47:10.000 --> 47:11.960\n then whatever, I'm always like,\n\n47:11.960 --> 47:16.240\n and he gives directions allocentrically,\n\n47:16.240 --> 47:21.000\n which means organized around north, south, east, west.\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:24.320\n So to you, the earth is at the center of the solar system\n\n47:24.320 --> 47:26.480\n and to him, reasonably.\n\n47:26.480 --> 47:27.320\n I'm at the center.\n\n47:27.320 --> 47:29.960\n You're at the center of the solar system.\n\n47:29.960 --> 47:30.920\n Okay, so.\n\n47:30.920 --> 47:35.920\n Anyway, but here, we had some really riproaring arguments,\n\n47:37.680 --> 47:40.280\n like really riproaring arguments where he would say,\n\n47:40.280 --> 47:41.920\n like, who is this for?\n\n47:41.920 --> 47:44.360\n Is this for the 1%?\n\n47:44.360 --> 47:47.880\n And I'd be like, 1% meaning not wealth,\n\n47:47.880 --> 47:51.120\n but like civilians versus academics.\n\n47:51.120 --> 47:52.160\n Are these for the scientists\n\n47:52.160 --> 47:54.120\n or is this for the civilians, right?\n\n47:54.120 --> 47:56.360\n So he speaks for the people, for the civilians.\n\n47:56.360 --> 47:59.200\n He speaks for the people and I'd be like, no, you have to.\n\n47:59.200 --> 48:03.080\n And so he made, after one terrible argument that we had\n\n48:03.080 --> 48:05.800\n where it was really starting to affect our relationship\n\n48:05.800 --> 48:09.040\n because we were so mad at each other all the time,\n\n48:09.040 --> 48:14.040\n he made these little signs, writing and science.\n\n48:14.280 --> 48:16.760\n And we only use them, this was like,\n\n48:17.760 --> 48:20.480\n when you pulled out a sign, that's it.\n\n48:20.480 --> 48:22.200\n Like the other person just wins\n\n48:22.200 --> 48:25.200\n and you have to stop fighting about it and that's it.\n\n48:25.200 --> 48:26.600\n And so we just did that.\n\n48:26.600 --> 48:29.160\n And we didn't really have to use it too much for this book\n\n48:29.160 --> 48:32.040\n because this book was in some ways,\n\n48:34.400 --> 48:37.280\n I didn't have to learn a lot of new things for this book.\n\n48:37.280 --> 48:39.960\n I had to learn some, but a lot of\n\n48:41.960 --> 48:46.480\n what I learned for How Emotions Are Made\n\n48:46.480 --> 48:49.600\n really stood me in good stead for this book.\n\n48:49.600 --> 48:50.440\n So there was a little bit,\n\n48:50.440 --> 48:52.400\n each essay was a little bit of learning.\n\n48:52.400 --> 48:55.920\n A couple were, was a little more than the small amount.\n\n48:55.920 --> 48:59.400\n But I didn't have so much trouble here.\n\n48:59.400 --> 49:02.320\n I had a lot of trouble with the first book.\n\n49:02.320 --> 49:07.320\n But still even here, he would tell me\n\n49:07.320 --> 49:08.720\n that I could take something out\n\n49:08.720 --> 49:10.160\n and I really wanted to keep it.\n\n49:10.160 --> 49:14.440\n And I think we only use the signs once.\n\n49:14.440 --> 49:17.160\n Well, if we could dive in some aspects of the book,\n\n49:17.160 --> 49:18.200\n I would love that.\n\n49:18.200 --> 49:23.200\n Can we talk about, so one of the essays looks at evolution.\n\n49:23.200 --> 49:24.620\n It looks at evolution.\n\n49:28.480 --> 49:30.880\n Let me ask the big question.\n\n49:30.880 --> 49:33.880\n Did the human brain evolve to think?\n\n49:33.880 --> 49:38.320\n That's essentially the question that you address in the essay.\n\n49:38.320 --> 49:39.440\n Can you speak to it?\n\n49:39.440 --> 49:40.960\n Sure.\n\n49:40.960 --> 49:43.360\n The big caveat here is that\n\n49:43.360 --> 49:45.760\n we don't really know why brains evolved.\n\n49:45.760 --> 49:49.800\n The big why questions are called teleological questions.\n\n49:49.800 --> 49:54.800\n And in general, scientists should avoid those questions\n\n49:55.040 --> 49:58.660\n because we don't know really why, we don't know the why.\n\n49:58.660 --> 50:03.660\n However, for a very long time,\n\n50:03.860 --> 50:07.080\n the assumption was that evolution worked\n\n50:07.080 --> 50:09.400\n in a progressive upward scale,\n\n50:09.400 --> 50:11.200\n that you start off with simple organisms\n\n50:11.200 --> 50:13.160\n and those organisms get more complex\n\n50:13.160 --> 50:14.940\n and more complex and more complex.\n\n50:14.940 --> 50:18.720\n Now, obviously that's true in some like really general way,\n\n50:18.720 --> 50:22.720\n right, that life started off as single cell organisms\n\n50:22.720 --> 50:24.440\n and things got more complex.\n\n50:24.440 --> 50:29.440\n But the idea that brains evolved in some upward trajectory\n\n50:32.320 --> 50:34.700\n from simple brains in simple animals\n\n50:34.700 --> 50:37.040\n to complex brains in complex animals\n\n50:37.040 --> 50:39.340\n is called a phylogenetic scale.\n\n50:40.240 --> 50:44.380\n And that phylogenetic scale is embedded\n\n50:44.380 --> 50:46.020\n in a lot of evolutionary thinking,\n\n50:46.020 --> 50:48.880\n including Darwin's actually.\n\n50:48.880 --> 50:53.120\n And it's been seriously challenged, I would say,\n\n50:53.120 --> 50:56.340\n by modern evolutionary biology.\n\n50:57.480 --> 51:01.540\n And so thinking is something that,\n\n51:01.540 --> 51:04.340\n rationality is something that humans,\n\n51:04.340 --> 51:07.360\n at least in the West, really prize\n\n51:07.360 --> 51:10.640\n as a great human achievement.\n\n51:10.640 --> 51:15.640\n And so the idea that the most common evolutionary story\n\n51:15.640 --> 51:20.360\n is that brains evolved in like sedimentary rock\n\n51:21.680 --> 51:25.520\n with a layer for instincts, that's your lizard brain,\n\n51:25.520 --> 51:30.460\n and a layer on top of that for emotions,\n\n51:30.460 --> 51:33.240\n that's your limbic system, limbic meaning border.\n\n51:33.240 --> 51:36.480\n So it borders the parts that are for instincts.\n\n51:36.480 --> 51:37.320\n Oh, interesting.\n\n51:37.320 --> 51:42.320\n And then the neocortex or new cortex\n\n51:42.320 --> 51:46.120\n where rationality is supposed to live.\n\n51:46.120 --> 51:48.440\n That's the sort of traditional story.\n\n51:48.440 --> 51:52.000\n It just keeps getting layered on top by evolution.\n\n51:52.000 --> 51:52.840\n Right.\n\n51:52.840 --> 51:55.880\n And so you can think about, I mean,\n\n51:55.880 --> 51:58.440\n sedimentary rock is the way typically people describe it.\n\n51:58.440 --> 52:00.440\n The way I sometimes like to think about it\n\n52:00.440 --> 52:03.320\n is thinking about the cerebral cortex\n\n52:03.320 --> 52:06.800\n like icing on an already baked cake,\n\n52:08.800 --> 52:11.120\n where the cake is your inner beast.\n\n52:11.120 --> 52:14.520\n These like boiling, roiling instincts and emotions\n\n52:14.520 --> 52:19.520\n that have to be contained by the cortex.\n\n52:19.760 --> 52:23.840\n And it's just, it's a fiction, it's a myth.\n\n52:23.840 --> 52:26.240\n It's a myth that you can trace all the way back\n\n52:26.240 --> 52:31.040\n to stories about morality in ancient Greece.\n\n52:31.040 --> 52:35.600\n But what you can do is look at the scientific record\n\n52:35.600 --> 52:38.120\n and say, well, there are other stories\n\n52:38.120 --> 52:40.160\n that you could tell about brain evolution\n\n52:40.160 --> 52:45.160\n and the context in which brains evolved.\n\n52:45.560 --> 52:50.560\n So when you look at creatures who don't have brains\n\n52:50.560 --> 52:55.040\n and you look at creatures who do, what's the difference?\n\n52:55.920 --> 53:00.920\n And you can look at some animals.\n\n53:02.960 --> 53:05.640\n So we call, scientists call an environment\n\n53:05.640 --> 53:09.280\n that an animal lives in a niche, their environmental niche.\n\n53:09.280 --> 53:10.800\n What are the things, what are the parts\n\n53:10.800 --> 53:13.160\n of the environment that matter to that animal?\n\n53:13.160 --> 53:15.840\n And so there are some animals whose niche\n\n53:15.840 --> 53:18.400\n hasn't changed in 400 million years.\n\n53:18.400 --> 53:21.520\n So they're not, these creatures are modern creatures\n\n53:21.520 --> 53:24.480\n but they're living in a niche that hasn't changed much.\n\n53:24.480 --> 53:27.200\n And so their biology hasn't changed much.\n\n53:27.200 --> 53:30.400\n And you can kind of verify that by looking at the genes\n\n53:30.400 --> 53:34.440\n that lurk deep in the molecular structure of cells.\n\n53:34.440 --> 53:38.880\n And so you can, by looking at various animals\n\n53:38.880 --> 53:41.920\n in their developmental state, meaning not,\n\n53:41.920 --> 53:43.160\n you don't look at adult animals,\n\n53:43.160 --> 53:46.920\n you look at embryos of animals and developing animals,\n\n53:46.920 --> 53:49.760\n you can see, you can piece together a different story.\n\n53:49.760 --> 53:53.960\n And that story is that brains evolved\n\n53:53.960 --> 53:57.960\n under the selection pressure of hunting.\n\n53:57.960 --> 54:01.840\n That in the Cambrian period, hunting emerged on the scene\n\n54:01.840 --> 54:05.000\n where animals deliberately ate one another.\n\n54:06.160 --> 54:11.160\n And what, so before the Cambrian period,\n\n54:11.200 --> 54:14.440\n the animals didn't really have,\n\n54:14.440 --> 54:15.840\n well, they didn't have brains,\n\n54:15.840 --> 54:19.000\n but they also didn't have senses really,\n\n54:19.000 --> 54:20.920\n the very, very rudimentary senses.\n\n54:20.920 --> 54:25.920\n So the animal that I wrote about in seven and a half lessons\n\n54:26.360 --> 54:29.120\n is called an amphioxus or a lancelet.\n\n54:29.120 --> 54:34.120\n And little amphioxus has no eyes,\n\n54:34.240 --> 54:38.960\n it has no ears, it has no nose, it has no eyes.\n\n54:38.960 --> 54:43.960\n It has a couple of cells for detecting light and dark\n\n54:44.760 --> 54:47.480\n for circadian rhythm purposes.\n\n54:47.480 --> 54:51.240\n And it can't hear, it has a vestibular cell\n\n54:51.240 --> 54:52.960\n to keep its body upright.\n\n54:53.960 --> 54:56.960\n It has a very rudimentary sense of touch\n\n54:56.960 --> 55:00.400\n and it doesn't really have any internal organs\n\n55:00.400 --> 55:03.040\n other than this like basically stomach.\n\n55:03.040 --> 55:04.760\n It's like a, just like a,\n\n55:04.760 --> 55:06.960\n it doesn't have an enteric nervous system.\n\n55:06.960 --> 55:11.440\n It doesn't have like a gut that moves like we do.\n\n55:11.440 --> 55:14.320\n It just has basically a tube.\n\n55:14.320 --> 55:16.680\n So it's like a little container, yeah.\n\n55:16.680 --> 55:20.120\n And so, and really it doesn't move very much.\n\n55:20.120 --> 55:22.120\n It can move, it just sort of wriggles.\n\n55:22.120 --> 55:24.680\n It doesn't have very sophisticated movement.\n\n55:24.680 --> 55:27.800\n And it's this really sweet little animal.\n\n55:27.800 --> 55:30.560\n It sort of wriggles its way to a spot\n\n55:30.560 --> 55:33.520\n and then plants itself in the sand\n\n55:33.520 --> 55:36.840\n and just filters food as the food goes by.\n\n55:37.880 --> 55:41.560\n And then when the food concentration decreases,\n\n55:41.560 --> 55:46.560\n it just ejects itself, wriggles to some spot randomly\n\n55:47.920 --> 55:50.440\n where probabilistically there will be more food\n\n55:50.440 --> 55:51.920\n and plants itself again.\n\n55:51.920 --> 55:56.280\n So it's not really aware,\n\n55:56.280 --> 55:58.320\n very aware that it has an environment.\n\n55:58.320 --> 56:00.680\n It has a niche, but that niche is very small\n\n56:00.680 --> 56:05.200\n and it's not really experiencing that niche very much.\n\n56:05.200 --> 56:08.040\n So it's basically like a little stomach on a stick.\n\n56:08.040 --> 56:09.800\n That's really what it is.\n\n56:09.800 --> 56:14.800\n And, but when animals start to literally hunt each other,\n\n56:14.800 --> 56:17.800\n all of a sudden it becomes important\n\n56:17.800 --> 56:20.480\n to have, to be able to sense your environment.\n\n56:20.480 --> 56:23.880\n Cause you need to know, is that blob up ahead\n\n56:23.880 --> 56:26.480\n gonna eat me or should I eat it?\n\n56:27.440 --> 56:29.520\n And so all of a sudden you want,\n\n56:29.520 --> 56:31.680\n distance senses are very useful.\n\n56:31.680 --> 56:35.680\n And so in the water, distance senses are vision\n\n56:36.720 --> 56:38.920\n and a little bit hearing.\n\n56:38.920 --> 56:43.920\n Olfaction, smelling and touch,\n\n56:43.920 --> 56:46.280\n because in the water touch is a distance sense\n\n56:46.280 --> 56:49.280\n cause you can feel the vibration, so it's right.\n\n56:49.280 --> 56:54.280\n So on land, you know, vision is a distance sense,\n\n56:54.600 --> 56:58.600\n touch not so much, but for elephants maybe, right?\n\n56:58.600 --> 56:59.440\n The vibrations.\n\n56:59.440 --> 57:02.760\n Vibrations, olfaction definitely\n\n57:02.760 --> 57:04.280\n because of the distance sense.\n\n57:04.280 --> 57:07.480\n And so it's very important to have a sense of touch\n\n57:07.480 --> 57:09.840\n and olfaction definitely because of the concentration\n\n57:09.840 --> 57:12.240\n of, you know, the more concentrated something is,\n\n57:12.240 --> 57:14.840\n the more likely it is to be close to you.\n\n57:14.840 --> 57:17.920\n So animals developed senses.\n\n57:17.920 --> 57:20.340\n They developed a head, like a literal head.\n\n57:20.340 --> 57:22.120\n So amphyoxus doesn't even have a head really.\n\n57:22.120 --> 57:23.640\n It's just a long.\n\n57:23.640 --> 57:25.760\n What's the purpose of a head?\n\n57:25.760 --> 57:27.360\n That's a great question.\n\n57:27.360 --> 57:29.600\n Is it to have a jaw?\n\n57:29.600 --> 57:30.800\n That's a great question.\n\n57:30.800 --> 57:35.560\n So jaw, so yes, jaws are a major.\n\n57:35.560 --> 57:36.680\n Useful feature.\n\n57:36.680 --> 57:39.280\n Yeah, obviously they're a major adaptation\n\n57:39.280 --> 57:42.600\n after there's a split between vertebrates and invertebrates.\n\n57:42.600 --> 57:45.320\n So amphyoxus is thought to be very, very similar\n\n57:45.320 --> 57:48.740\n to the animal that's before that split.\n\n57:48.740 --> 57:50.160\n But then after the development,\n\n57:50.160 --> 57:52.660\n very quickly after the development of a head\n\n57:52.660 --> 57:56.060\n is the development of a jaw, which is a big thing.\n\n57:56.060 --> 57:59.400\n And what goes along with that\n\n57:59.400 --> 58:02.000\n is the development of a brain.\n\n58:02.000 --> 58:04.160\n It's weird, is that just a coincidence\n\n58:04.160 --> 58:07.800\n that the thing, the part of our body,\n\n58:07.800 --> 58:12.520\n of the mammal, I think, body that we eat with\n\n58:12.520 --> 58:15.300\n and attack others with is also the thing\n\n58:15.300 --> 58:20.300\n that contains all the majority of the brain type of stuff.\n\n58:21.840 --> 58:25.000\n Well, actually the brain goes with the development of a head\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:27.760\n and the development of a visual system\n\n58:27.760 --> 58:31.440\n and an auditory system and an olfactory system and so on.\n\n58:31.440 --> 58:34.800\n So your senses are developing\n\n58:34.800 --> 58:38.740\n and the other thing that's happening\n\n58:38.740 --> 58:40.440\n is that animals are getting bigger\n\n58:41.680 --> 58:44.560\n because they're, and also their niche is getting bigger.\n\n58:44.560 --> 58:47.840\n Well, this is the, just sorry to take a tiny tangent\n\n58:47.840 --> 58:50.400\n on the niche thing is it seems like the niche\n\n58:50.400 --> 58:53.400\n is getting bigger, but not just bigger,\n\n58:53.400 --> 58:56.680\n like more complicated, like shaped in weird ways.\n\n58:56.680 --> 59:01.680\n So predation seems to create, the whole world\n\n59:01.760 --> 59:03.400\n becomes your oyster, whatever,\n\n59:03.400 --> 59:06.680\n but you also start to carve out the places\n\n59:06.680 --> 59:08.360\n in which you can operate the best.\n\n59:08.360 --> 59:10.500\n Yeah, and in fact, that's absolutely right.\n\n59:10.500 --> 59:15.040\n And in fact, some scientists think that theory of mind,\n\n59:15.040 --> 59:16.520\n your ability to make inferences\n\n59:16.520 --> 59:21.000\n about the inner life of other creatures\n\n59:21.000 --> 59:24.200\n actually developed under the selection pressure of predation\n\n59:24.200 --> 59:28.100\n because it makes you a better predator.\n\n59:28.100 --> 59:31.180\n Do you ever look at, you just said you looked at babies\n\n59:31.180 --> 59:34.960\n as these wiring creatures.\n\n59:34.960 --> 59:39.300\n Do you ever think of humans as just clever predators?\n\n59:39.300 --> 59:43.120\n Like that there's, underneath it all is this\n\n59:44.560 --> 59:49.440\n the Nietzschean will to power in all of its forms?\n\n59:49.440 --> 59:52.080\n Or are we now friendlier?\n\n59:52.080 --> 59:54.200\n Yeah, so it's interesting.\n\n59:54.200 --> 59:57.260\n I mean, there are zeitgeists\n\n59:57.260 --> 59:59.660\n in how humans think about themselves, right?\n\n59:59.660 --> 1:00:02.440\n And so if you look in the 20th century,\n\n1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:08.020\n you can see that the idea of an inner beast\n\n1:00:08.020 --> 1:00:10.880\n that we're just predators, we're just basically animals,\n\n1:00:10.880 --> 1:00:13.300\n baseless animals, violent animals\n\n1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:15.240\n that have to be contained by culture\n\n1:00:15.240 --> 1:00:17.640\n and by our prodigious neocortex\n\n1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:22.640\n really took hold, particularly after World War I,\n\n1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:30.300\n and really held sway for much of that century.\n\n1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:36.940\n And then around, at least in Western writing, I would say,\n\n1:00:36.940 --> 1:00:38.520\n you know, we're talking mainly\n\n1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:41.140\n about Western scientific writing,\n\n1:00:41.140 --> 1:00:42.780\n Western philosophical writing.\n\n1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:47.780\n And then, you know, late 90s maybe,\n\n1:00:47.980 --> 1:00:50.500\n you start to see books and articles\n\n1:00:50.500 --> 1:00:53.560\n about our social nature, that we're social animals.\n\n1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:54.660\n And we are social animals,\n\n1:00:54.660 --> 1:00:57.140\n but what does that mean exactly?\n\n1:00:57.140 --> 1:01:00.180\n And about.\n\n1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:02.020\n It's us carving out different niches\n\n1:01:02.020 --> 1:01:03.460\n in the space of ideas, it looks like.\n\n1:01:03.460 --> 1:01:04.500\n I think so, I think so.\n\n1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:13.500\n So, you know, do humans, can humans be violent?\n\n1:01:14.040 --> 1:01:15.540\n Yes.\n\n1:01:15.540 --> 1:01:17.940\n Can humans be really helpful?\n\n1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:19.720\n Yes, actually.\n\n1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:22.920\n And humans are interesting creatures\n\n1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:25.940\n because, you know, other animals\n\n1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:28.340\n can also be helpful to one another.\n\n1:01:28.340 --> 1:01:30.940\n In fact, there's a whole literature, booming literature\n\n1:01:30.940 --> 1:01:35.940\n on how other animals support one another.\n\n1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:40.620\n They regulate each other's nervous systems\n\n1:01:40.620 --> 1:01:41.700\n in interesting ways,\n\n1:01:41.700 --> 1:01:43.540\n and they will be helpful to one another, right?\n\n1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:46.400\n So for example, there's a whole literature on rodents\n\n1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:51.400\n and how they signal one another what is safe to eat,\n\n1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:57.000\n and they will perform acts of generosity\n\n1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:01.000\n to their conspecifics that are related to them,\n\n1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.280\n or who they were raised with.\n\n1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.960\n So if an animal was raised in a litter\n\n1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:07.760\n that they were raised in,\n\n1:02:07.760 --> 1:02:09.360\n although not even at the same time,\n\n1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:11.320\n they'll be more likely to help that animal.\n\n1:02:11.320 --> 1:02:14.800\n So there's always some kind of physical relationship\n\n1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:17.720\n between animals that predicts\n\n1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:19.840\n whether or not they'll help one another.\n\n1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:27.800\n For humans, you know, we have ways of categorizing\n\n1:02:27.800 --> 1:02:32.800\n who's in our group and who isn't by nonphysical ways, right?\n\n1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:35.960\n Even by just something abstract, like an idea.\n\n1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:39.840\n And we are much more likely to extend help\n\n1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:41.760\n to people in our own group,\n\n1:02:41.760 --> 1:02:44.960\n whatever that group may be at that moment,\n\n1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:48.760\n whatever feature you're using to do that.\n\n1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:51.040\n Feature you're using to define who's in your group\n\n1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:51.920\n and who isn't.\n\n1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.840\n We're more likely to help those people\n\n1:02:55.840 --> 1:02:59.240\n than even members of our own family at times.\n\n1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:03.240\n So humans are much more flexible in their,\n\n1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.000\n in the way that they help one another,\n\n1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.860\n but also in the way that they harm one another.\n\n1:03:08.860 --> 1:03:13.860\n So I don't think I subscribe to,\n\n1:03:13.860 --> 1:03:18.180\n I don't think I subscribe to, you know,\n\n1:03:18.180 --> 1:03:21.020\n we are primarily this or we are primarily that.\n\n1:03:21.020 --> 1:03:25.140\n I don't think humans have essences in that way, really.\n\n1:03:25.140 --> 1:03:27.260\n I apologize to take us in this direction\n\n1:03:27.260 --> 1:03:28.260\n for a brief moment,\n\n1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:31.940\n but I've been really deep on Stalin and Hitler recently\n\n1:03:32.900 --> 1:03:34.060\n in terms of reading.\n\n1:03:34.060 --> 1:03:37.860\n And is there something that you think about\n\n1:03:37.860 --> 1:03:41.580\n in terms of the nature of evil\n\n1:03:41.580 --> 1:03:44.020\n from a neuroscience perspective?\n\n1:03:44.020 --> 1:03:49.020\n Is there some lessons that are sort of hopeful\n\n1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:57.220\n about human civilization that we can find in our brain\n\n1:03:58.060 --> 1:04:00.280\n with regard to the Hitlers of the world?\n\n1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:05.360\n Do you think about the nature of evil?\n\n1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.420\n Yeah, I do.\n\n1:04:07.420 --> 1:04:11.020\n I don't know that what I have to say is so useful\n\n1:04:11.020 --> 1:04:14.100\n from a, I don't know that I can say as a neuroscientist,\n\n1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:17.700\n well, here's a study that, you know,\n\n1:04:17.700 --> 1:04:20.180\n so I sort of have to take off my lab coat, right?\n\n1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:22.780\n And now I'm gonna now conjecture as a human\n\n1:04:22.780 --> 1:04:24.660\n who just also, who has opinions,\n\n1:04:24.660 --> 1:04:28.140\n but who also maybe has some knowledge about neuroscience.\n\n1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:30.640\n But I'm not speaking as a neuroscientist when I say this,\n\n1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:33.680\n cause I don't think neuroscientists know enough really\n\n1:04:33.680 --> 1:04:34.520\n to be able to say,\n\n1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:38.000\n but I guess the kinds of things I think about are,\n\n1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:43.000\n what, so I have always thought,\n\n1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:47.280\n even before I knew anything about neuroscience,\n\n1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:49.680\n I've always thought that,\n\n1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:54.980\n I don't think anybody could become Hitler,\n\n1:04:54.980 --> 1:04:58.540\n but I think the majority of people can be,\n\n1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:02.760\n can do, are capable of doing very bad things.\n\n1:05:05.260 --> 1:05:06.680\n It's just, the question is really\n\n1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:09.200\n how much encouragement does it take from the environment\n\n1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:11.240\n to get them to do something bad?\n\n1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:14.400\n That's what I kind of, when I look at the life of Hitler,\n\n1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:19.400\n it seems like there's so many places where...\n\n1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:20.960\n Something could have intervened.\n\n1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:23.360\n Intervene, no, it could change completely the person.\n\n1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:25.280\n I mean, there's like the caricature,\n\n1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:28.480\n like the obvious places where he was an artist\n\n1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.360\n and if he wasn't rejected as an artist,\n\n1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.080\n he was a reasonably good artist.\n\n1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:33.360\n So that could have changed,\n\n1:05:33.360 --> 1:05:36.760\n but just his entire, like where he went in Vienna\n\n1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:37.720\n and all these kinds of things,\n\n1:05:37.720 --> 1:05:40.000\n like little interactions could have changed\n\n1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:44.240\n and there's probably millions of other people\n\n1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:49.240\n who are capable, who the environment may be able to mold\n\n1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.760\n in the same way it did this particular person\n\n1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:55.960\n to create this particular kind of charismatic leader\n\n1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:57.560\n in this particular moment of time.\n\n1:05:57.560 --> 1:06:01.360\n Absolutely, and I guess the way that I would say it,\n\n1:06:01.360 --> 1:06:04.000\n I would agree 100% and I guess the way that I would say it\n\n1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:08.200\n is like this, in the West,\n\n1:06:08.200 --> 1:06:13.200\n we have a way of reasoning about causation,\n\n1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:19.080\n which focuses on single, simple causes for things.\n\n1:06:21.280 --> 1:06:22.680\n There's an essence to Hitler,\n\n1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:24.800\n there's an essence to his character.\n\n1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:26.640\n He was born with that essence\n\n1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:30.160\n or it was forged very, very early in his life\n\n1:06:30.160 --> 1:06:35.160\n and that explains the horrible landscape of his behavior.\n\n1:06:38.720 --> 1:06:41.080\n But there's another way to think about it,\n\n1:06:41.080 --> 1:06:42.800\n a way that actually is much more consistent\n\n1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:45.720\n with what we know about biology,\n\n1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:48.920\n how biology works in the physical world.\n\n1:06:48.920 --> 1:06:52.160\n And that is that most things are complex,\n\n1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.280\n not as in, wow, this is really complex and hard,\n\n1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:56.880\n but complex as in complexity,\n\n1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:59.800\n that is more than the sum of their parts\n\n1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:03.880\n and that most phenomena have many, many\n\n1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:08.760\n weak nonlinear interacting causes.\n\n1:07:08.760 --> 1:07:13.760\n And so little things that we might not even be aware of\n\n1:07:13.880 --> 1:07:17.200\n can shift someone's developmental trajectory\n\n1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.000\n from this to that and that's enough\n\n1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:23.200\n to take it on a whole set of other paths\n\n1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:28.400\n and that these things are happening all the time.\n\n1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:31.280\n So it's not random and it's not really,\n\n1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:32.840\n it's not deterministic in the sense\n\n1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:35.960\n that like everything you do determines your outcome,\n\n1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:40.960\n but it's a little more like you're nudging someone\n\n1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:44.520\n from one set of possibilities\n\n1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.640\n to another set of possibilities.\n\n1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:50.000\n But I think the thing that I find optimistic\n\n1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:54.680\n is that the other side of that coin is also true.\n\n1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:59.680\n So look at all the people who risked their lives\n\n1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:04.520\n to help people they didn't even know.\n\n1:08:05.400 --> 1:08:09.120\n I mean, I just watched Borat, the new Borat movie.\n\n1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.680\n And the thing that I came away with,\n\n1:08:11.680 --> 1:08:14.320\n but the thing I came away with was,\n\n1:08:15.280 --> 1:08:19.000\n look at how generous people were in that.\n\n1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.400\n Oh, he's making, there are a lot of people he makes fun of\n\n1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:24.600\n and that's fine, but think about like those two people\n\n1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:27.080\n two guys, those.\n\n1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:28.400\n The Trump supporter guys.\n\n1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:29.960\n The Trump supporter guys.\n\n1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:30.800\n Those guys.\n\n1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:33.200\n That was cool, there was kindness in them, right?\n\n1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:38.200\n They took a complete stranger in a pandemic\n\n1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:40.400\n into their house.\n\n1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:42.920\n Who does that?\n\n1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:44.720\n Like that's a really nice thing.\n\n1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:47.540\n Or there's one scene, I mean, I don't wanna spoil it\n\n1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:49.340\n for people who haven't seen it,\n\n1:08:49.340 --> 1:08:51.800\n but there's one scene where he goes in,\n\n1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:56.800\n he dresses up as a Jew, I laugh myself sick at that scene,\n\n1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:00.840\n seriously, but he goes in\n\n1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:03.080\n and there are these two old Jewish ladies.\n\n1:09:04.180 --> 1:09:07.920\n What a bunch of sweethearts, oh my gosh.\n\n1:09:07.920 --> 1:09:12.240\n Like really, I mean, that was what I was struck by actually.\n\n1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:15.440\n I mean, there are other ones or like the babysitter, right?\n\n1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:18.560\n I mean, she was really kind.\n\n1:09:18.560 --> 1:09:22.680\n And yeah, so that's really what I was more struck by.\n\n1:09:22.680 --> 1:09:25.480\n Like sure, there are other people\n\n1:09:25.480 --> 1:09:30.480\n who do very bad things or say bad things or whatever,\n\n1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:35.160\n but like there's one guy who's completely stoic,\n\n1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:39.160\n like the guy who's sending the messages,\n\n1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:41.760\n I don't know if it's facts or whatever.\n\n1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.440\n He's just completely stoic,\n\n1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:45.580\n but he's doing his job actually.\n\n1:09:45.580 --> 1:09:48.880\n Like you don't know what he was thinking inside his head,\n\n1:09:48.880 --> 1:09:49.800\n you don't know what he's feeling,\n\n1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:52.120\n but he was totally professional doing his job.\n\n1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:58.080\n So I guess I just, I had a bit of a different view, I guess.\n\n1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:00.440\n So I also think that about people,\n\n1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:04.000\n I think everybody is capable of kindness,\n\n1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:08.820\n but the question is how much does it take\n\n1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:09.880\n and what are the circumstances?\n\n1:10:09.880 --> 1:10:11.920\n So for some people it's gonna take a lot\n\n1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:14.360\n and for some people it only takes a little bit,\n\n1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:19.360\n but are we actually cultivating an environment\n\n1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:26.680\n for the next generation that provides opportunities\n\n1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.720\n for people to go in the direction of caring and kindness\n\n1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:37.720\n or, and I'm not saying that as like a Pollyanna ish person.\n\n1:10:40.360 --> 1:10:42.600\n I think there's a lot of room for competition\n\n1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:45.240\n and debate and so on,\n\n1:10:45.240 --> 1:10:50.200\n but I don't see Hitler as an anomaly and I never have,\n\n1:10:50.200 --> 1:10:52.680\n that was even before I learned anything about neuroscience.\n\n1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:55.000\n And now I would say knowing what we know\n\n1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.280\n about developmental trajectories and life histories\n\n1:10:57.280 --> 1:10:58.600\n and how important that is,\n\n1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:03.600\n knowing what we know about that the whole question\n\n1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:07.860\n of like nature versus nurture is a completely wrong question.\n\n1:11:07.860 --> 1:11:11.000\n We have the kind of nature that requires nurture,\n\n1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.960\n we have the kind of genes that allow infants to be born\n\n1:11:14.960 --> 1:11:18.040\n with unfinished brains where the brains,\n\n1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:21.900\n their brains are wired across a 25 year period\n\n1:11:21.900 --> 1:11:23.780\n with wiring instructions from the world\n\n1:11:23.780 --> 1:11:25.980\n that is created for them.\n\n1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:29.940\n And so I don't think Hitler is an anomaly,\n\n1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:37.040\n even if it's less probable that that would happen,\n\n1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:39.160\n it's possible that it could happen again\n\n1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:43.280\n and it's not like, you know, he's a bad seed.\n\n1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:45.980\n I mean, that doesn't, I just wanna say for like,\n\n1:11:45.980 --> 1:11:48.720\n of course he's completely 100% responsible for his actions\n\n1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:50.120\n and all the bad things that happen.\n\n1:11:50.120 --> 1:11:53.360\n So I'm not in any way, this is not me saying.\n\n1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:56.240\n But the environment is also responsible in part\n\n1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:59.240\n for creating the evil in this world.\n\n1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:04.240\n So like Hitler's in different versions of even more subtle,\n\n1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:07.480\n more smaller scale versions of evil.\n\n1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:12.480\n But I tend to believe that there's a much stronger,\n\n1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:16.360\n I don't like to talk about evolutionary advantages,\n\n1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:20.520\n but it seems like it makes sense for love\n\n1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:25.240\n to be a more powerful emergent phenomena\n\n1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:28.680\n of our collective intelligence versus hate\n\n1:12:28.680 --> 1:12:30.540\n and evil and destruction.\n\n1:12:30.540 --> 1:12:34.400\n Because from a survival, from a niche perspective,\n\n1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:38.600\n it seems to be like in my own life\n\n1:12:38.600 --> 1:12:40.280\n and my thinking about the intuition\n\n1:12:40.280 --> 1:12:44.560\n about the way humans work together to solve problems,\n\n1:12:44.560 --> 1:12:47.760\n it seems that love is a very useful tool.\n\n1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.080\n I definitely agree with you.\n\n1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:54.400\n But I think the caveat here is that, you know,\n\n1:12:54.400 --> 1:12:58.600\n humans, the research suggests that humans are capable\n\n1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:03.600\n of great acts of kindness and great acts of generosity\n\n1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:06.500\n to people in their in group.\n\n1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:10.820\n Right, so we're also tribal.\n\n1:13:11.720 --> 1:13:14.400\n Yeah, I mean, that's the kitschy way to say it.\n\n1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:16.560\n We're tribes, we're tribal, yeah.\n\n1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:18.280\n So that's the kitschy way to say it.\n\n1:13:18.280 --> 1:13:22.320\n What I would say is that, you know,\n\n1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:24.600\n there are a lot of features\n\n1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:28.300\n that you can use to describe yourself.\n\n1:13:28.300 --> 1:13:31.160\n You don't have one identity, you don't have one self,\n\n1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:33.600\n you have many selves, you have many identities.\n\n1:13:34.580 --> 1:13:37.420\n Sometimes you're a man, sometimes you're a scientist,\n\n1:13:37.420 --> 1:13:40.240\n sometimes you're a, do you have a brother or a sister?\n\n1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:41.060\n Yeah, brother.\n\n1:13:41.060 --> 1:13:42.400\n So sometimes you're a brother.\n\n1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:45.120\n You know, sometimes you're a friend.\n\n1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.640\n Sometimes you're a human so you can keep zooming out.\n\n1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:48.480\n Yes, exactly.\n\n1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:49.660\n Living organism on Earth.\n\n1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:53.400\n Yes, exactly, that's exactly right.\n\n1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:58.120\n And so there are some people\n\n1:13:58.120 --> 1:14:01.820\n who there is research which suggests\n\n1:14:01.820 --> 1:14:05.180\n that there are some people who will tell you,\n\n1:14:05.180 --> 1:14:08.660\n I think it's appropriate and better to help.\n\n1:14:08.660 --> 1:14:11.420\n I should help my family more than I should help my neighbors\n\n1:14:11.420 --> 1:14:13.920\n and I should help my neighbors more than I should help\n\n1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:15.360\n the average stranger.\n\n1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.240\n And I should help, you know, the average stranger\n\n1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:20.840\n in my country more than I should help\n\n1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:22.120\n somebody outside my country.\n\n1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:25.480\n And I should help humans more than I should help,\n\n1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:26.520\n you know, other animals.\n\n1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:28.400\n And I should, right, so there's a clear hierarchy\n\n1:14:28.400 --> 1:14:33.120\n of helping and there are other people who, you know,\n\n1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:37.120\n they are, their niche is much more inclusive, right?\n\n1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:40.920\n And that they're humans first, right?\n\n1:14:40.920 --> 1:14:43.660\n Or creatures of the Earth first, let's say.\n\n1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:50.400\n And I don't think we know how flexible those attitudes are\n\n1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.960\n because I don't think the research really tells us that.\n\n1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:56.860\n But in any case, there are, you know,\n\n1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:59.960\n and there are beliefs, people also have beliefs about,\n\n1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:03.360\n there's this really interesting research in,\n\n1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:06.720\n really in anthropology that looks at\n\n1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:12.420\n what are cultures particularly afraid of?\n\n1:15:12.420 --> 1:15:15.160\n Like what the people in a particular culture\n\n1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.360\n are organizing their social systems\n\n1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:20.120\n to prevent certain types of problems.\n\n1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:22.200\n So what are the problems that they're worried about?\n\n1:15:22.200 --> 1:15:24.360\n And so there are some cultures that are much more\n\n1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:28.400\n hierarchical and some cultures that are,\n\n1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:30.520\n you know, much more egalitarian.\n\n1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.380\n There are some cultures that, you know,\n\n1:15:32.380 --> 1:15:35.700\n in the debate of like getting along versus getting ahead,\n\n1:15:35.700 --> 1:15:38.640\n there are some cultures that really prioritize\n\n1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.100\n the individual over the group.\n\n1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:41.880\n And there are other cultures that really prioritize\n\n1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:43.300\n the group over the individual.\n\n1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:45.340\n You know, it's not like one of these is right\n\n1:15:45.340 --> 1:15:47.880\n and one of these is wrong, it's that, you know,\n\n1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:49.600\n different combinations of these features\n\n1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:52.960\n are different solutions that humans have come up with\n\n1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:55.600\n for living in groups,\n\n1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:58.280\n which is a major adaptive advantage of our species.\n\n1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.640\n And it's not the case that one of these is better\n\n1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:03.840\n and one of these is worse.\n\n1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:07.320\n Although as a person, of course, I have opinions about that.\n\n1:16:07.320 --> 1:16:10.600\n And as a person, I can say,\n\n1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:14.000\n I would very much prefer certain, I have certain beliefs\n\n1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:15.680\n and I really want everyone in the world\n\n1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.360\n to live by those beliefs, you know.\n\n1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:21.360\n But as a scientist, I know that it's not really the case\n\n1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:24.200\n that for the species,\n\n1:16:24.200 --> 1:16:26.920\n any one of these is better than any other.\n\n1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:29.920\n There are different solutions that work differentially well\n\n1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:34.920\n in particular, you know, ecological parts of the world.\n\n1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:39.180\n But for individual humans,\n\n1:16:39.180 --> 1:16:42.120\n there are definitely some systems that are better\n\n1:16:42.120 --> 1:16:43.840\n and some systems that are worse, right?\n\n1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:46.820\n But when anthropologists or when neuroscientists\n\n1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:48.360\n or biologists are talking,\n\n1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:50.460\n they're not usually talking about the lives\n\n1:16:50.460 --> 1:16:52.040\n of individual people,\n\n1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:54.400\n they're talking about, you know, the species,\n\n1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:55.640\n what's better for the species,\n\n1:16:55.640 --> 1:16:57.360\n the survivability of the species.\n\n1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:59.960\n And what's better for the survivability of the species\n\n1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:01.640\n is variation,\n\n1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:03.680\n that we have lots of cultures\n\n1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:05.800\n with lots of different solutions\n\n1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:09.880\n because if the environment were to change drastically,\n\n1:17:09.880 --> 1:17:14.880\n some of those solutions will work better than others.\n\n1:17:17.580 --> 1:17:21.500\n And you can see that happening with COVID.\n\n1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:23.780\n Right, so some people might be more susceptible\n\n1:17:23.780 --> 1:17:26.220\n to this virus than others.\n\n1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:28.380\n And so variation is very useful.\n\n1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:32.020\n Say COVID was much, much more destructive than it is.\n\n1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:36.020\n And like, I don't know, 20% of the population died.\n\n1:17:36.020 --> 1:17:40.180\n So, you know, it's good to have variability\n\n1:17:40.180 --> 1:17:42.860\n because then at least some percent will survive.\n\n1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:46.540\n Yeah, I mean, the way that I used to describe it\n\n1:17:46.540 --> 1:17:51.300\n was, you know, using, you know, those movies\n\n1:17:51.300 --> 1:17:55.180\n like the War of the Worlds or Pacific Rim,\n\n1:17:55.180 --> 1:17:58.360\n you know, where like aliens come down from outer space\n\n1:17:58.360 --> 1:18:01.220\n and they, you know, wanna kill humans.\n\n1:18:01.220 --> 1:18:04.560\n And so all the humans band together as a species\n\n1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:06.500\n and they all, like all the, you know,\n\n1:18:06.500 --> 1:18:08.900\n little squabbling from countries and whatever\n\n1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:10.460\n all, you know, goes away\n\n1:18:10.460 --> 1:18:13.340\n and everyone is just one big, you know.\n\n1:18:13.340 --> 1:18:18.340\n Well, that, you know, that doesn't happen.\n\n1:18:19.700 --> 1:18:21.980\n I mean, cause COVID is, you know,\n\n1:18:21.980 --> 1:18:26.980\n a virus like COVID 19 is like a creature from outer space.\n\n1:18:29.940 --> 1:18:31.780\n And that's not what you see happening.\n\n1:18:31.780 --> 1:18:33.260\n What you do see happening,\n\n1:18:33.260 --> 1:18:35.580\n it is true that some people, I mean,\n\n1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:37.860\n we could use this as an example of essentialism also.\n\n1:18:37.860 --> 1:18:41.240\n So just to say, like exposure to the virus does not mean\n\n1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:45.020\n that you will become infected with a disease.\n\n1:18:45.020 --> 1:18:48.200\n So, I mean, in controlled studies,\n\n1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:51.540\n one of which was actually a coronavirus, not COVID,\n\n1:18:51.540 --> 1:18:55.140\n but this was, these are studies from 10 or so years ago,\n\n1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:59.460\n you know, only somewhere between 20 and 40% of people\n\n1:18:59.460 --> 1:19:02.180\n were developed respiratory illness\n\n1:19:02.180 --> 1:19:04.680\n when a virus was placed in their nose.\n\n1:19:06.300 --> 1:19:07.140\n And so.\n\n1:19:07.140 --> 1:19:09.060\n And there's a dose question, all those.\n\n1:19:09.060 --> 1:19:10.660\n Well, not in these studies, actually.\n\n1:19:10.660 --> 1:19:11.580\n So in these studies,\n\n1:19:11.580 --> 1:19:14.400\n the dose was consistent across all people\n\n1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:16.780\n and everything, you know,\n\n1:19:16.780 --> 1:19:18.820\n they were sequestered in hotel rooms\n\n1:19:18.820 --> 1:19:21.380\n and what they ate was, you know,\n\n1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:23.220\n measured out by scientists and so on.\n\n1:19:23.220 --> 1:19:25.620\n And so when you hold dose, I mean,\n\n1:19:25.620 --> 1:19:27.980\n the dose issue is a real issue in the real world,\n\n1:19:27.980 --> 1:19:32.460\n but in these studies, that was controlled.\n\n1:19:32.460 --> 1:19:34.580\n And only somewhere between 20,\n\n1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:35.420\n depending on the study,\n\n1:19:35.420 --> 1:19:38.700\n between 20 and 40% of people became infected with a disease.\n\n1:19:38.700 --> 1:19:43.340\n So exposure to a virus doesn't mean de facto\n\n1:19:43.340 --> 1:19:46.340\n that you will develop an illness.\n\n1:19:46.340 --> 1:19:47.660\n You will be a carrier\n\n1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:50.220\n and you will spread the virus to other people,\n\n1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:52.540\n but you yourself may not,\n\n1:19:52.540 --> 1:19:55.820\n your immune system may be in a state\n\n1:19:55.820 --> 1:19:58.740\n that you can make enough antibodies\n\n1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:03.500\n to not show symptoms, not develop symptoms.\n\n1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:08.340\n And so, of course, what this means is,\n\n1:20:08.340 --> 1:20:10.380\n again, is that, you know,\n\n1:20:10.380 --> 1:20:12.700\n like if I asked you, do you think, you know,\n\n1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:17.460\n a virus is the cause of a common cold or,\n\n1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:19.780\n you know, most people, if I asked this question,\n\n1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:21.760\n I can tell you, because I asked this question.\n\n1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:25.780\n So do you think a virus is the cause of a cold?\n\n1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:27.780\n Most people would say, yes, I think it is.\n\n1:20:27.780 --> 1:20:28.620\n And then I say, yeah, well,\n\n1:20:28.620 --> 1:20:32.620\n only 20 to 40% of people develop respiratory illness\n\n1:20:32.620 --> 1:20:34.300\n in exposure to a virus.\n\n1:20:34.300 --> 1:20:38.020\n So clearly it is a necessary cause,\n\n1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:39.660\n but it's not a sufficient cause.\n\n1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:41.060\n And there are other causes, again,\n\n1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:44.100\n so not simple single causes for things, right?\n\n1:20:44.100 --> 1:20:47.540\n Multiple interacting influences.\n\n1:20:47.540 --> 1:20:50.420\n So it is true that individuals vary\n\n1:20:50.420 --> 1:20:53.560\n in their susceptibility to illness upon exposure,\n\n1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:57.900\n but different cultures have different sets of norms\n\n1:20:57.900 --> 1:21:01.300\n and practices that allow,\n\n1:21:01.300 --> 1:21:04.720\n that will slow or speed the spread.\n\n1:21:05.820 --> 1:21:08.820\n And that's the point that I was actually trying to make here\n\n1:21:08.820 --> 1:21:13.820\n that, you know, when the environment changes,\n\n1:21:15.220 --> 1:21:18.720\n that is, there's a mutation of a virus\n\n1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:21.620\n that is incredibly infectious,\n\n1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:25.540\n some cultures will succumb,\n\n1:21:25.540 --> 1:21:27.600\n people in some cultures will succumb faster\n\n1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:32.380\n because of the particular norms and practices\n\n1:21:32.380 --> 1:21:35.600\n that they've developed in their culture\n\n1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:36.560\n versus other cultures.\n\n1:21:36.560 --> 1:21:40.540\n Now, there could be some other, you know,\n\n1:21:40.540 --> 1:21:45.240\n thing that changes that where those other cultures\n\n1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.420\n or, you know, would do better.\n\n1:21:46.420 --> 1:21:49.780\n So very individualistic cultures like ours\n\n1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:53.840\n may do much better under other types of selection pressures.\n\n1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:57.460\n But for COVID, for things like COVID,\n\n1:21:57.460 --> 1:22:00.000\n you know, my colleague Michelle Gelfant,\n\n1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:03.960\n her research shows that she looks at like loose cultures\n\n1:22:03.960 --> 1:22:04.800\n and tight cultures,\n\n1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:08.160\n so cultures that have very, very strict rules\n\n1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.440\n versus cultures that are much more individualistic\n\n1:22:10.440 --> 1:22:14.220\n and where personal freedoms are more valued.\n\n1:22:14.220 --> 1:22:18.100\n And she, you know, her research suggests that\n\n1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:22.100\n for pandemic circumstances, tight cultures actually,\n\n1:22:22.100 --> 1:22:23.480\n the people survive better.\n\n1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:27.180\n Just to linger a little bit longer,\n\n1:22:27.180 --> 1:22:30.620\n we started this part of the conversation talking about,\n\n1:22:30.620 --> 1:22:33.360\n you know, did humans evolve to think,\n\n1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:36.020\n did the human brain evolve to think,\n\n1:22:36.020 --> 1:22:39.460\n implying is there like a progress to the thing\n\n1:22:39.460 --> 1:22:41.380\n that's always improving?\n\n1:22:41.380 --> 1:22:43.600\n That's right, we never, yeah,\n\n1:22:43.600 --> 1:22:46.060\n and so the answer is no.\n\n1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:47.860\n But let me sort of push back,\n\n1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:51.020\n but so your intuition is very strong here,\n\n1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:54.000\n not your intuition, the way you describe this,\n\n1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:58.540\n but is it possible there's a direction to this evolution?\n\n1:22:58.540 --> 1:23:01.920\n Like, do you think of this evolution as having a direction?\n\n1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:04.620\n Like it's like walking along a certain path\n\n1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:06.540\n towards something?\n\n1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:08.980\n Is it, you know, what is it?\n\n1:23:12.140 --> 1:23:16.700\n Is it Elon Musk said like the Earth got bombarded\n\n1:23:16.700 --> 1:23:20.700\n with photons and then all of a sudden,\n\n1:23:20.700 --> 1:23:23.180\n like a Tesla was launched into space or whatever,\n\n1:23:23.180 --> 1:23:24.420\n a rocket started coming?\n\n1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:26.780\n Like, is there a sense in which,\n\n1:23:26.780 --> 1:23:30.780\n even though in the, like within the system,\n\n1:23:30.780 --> 1:23:33.140\n the evolution seems to be this mess of variation,\n\n1:23:33.140 --> 1:23:35.980\n we're kind of trying to find our niches and so on,\n\n1:23:35.980 --> 1:23:38.780\n but do you think there, ultimately, when you zoom out,\n\n1:23:38.780 --> 1:23:40.860\n there is a direction that's strong,\n\n1:23:40.860 --> 1:23:45.860\n that does tend towards greater complexity and intelligence?\n\n1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:50.080\n No.\n\n1:23:50.940 --> 1:23:54.900\n So, I mean, and again, what I would say is I'm really,\n\n1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:58.220\n I'm really just echoing people who are much smarter\n\n1:23:58.220 --> 1:24:00.060\n than I am about this.\n\n1:24:00.060 --> 1:24:01.600\n But see, you're saying smarter.\n\n1:24:01.600 --> 1:24:03.420\n I thought it doesn't, there's no,\n\n1:24:03.420 --> 1:24:04.960\n I thought there's no smarter.\n\n1:24:04.960 --> 1:24:06.180\n No, I didn't say there's no smarter.\n\n1:24:06.180 --> 1:24:08.060\n I said there's no direction.\n\n1:24:08.060 --> 1:24:11.700\n So I think the thing to say, or what I understand\n\n1:24:11.700 --> 1:24:15.360\n to be the case, is that there's variation.\n\n1:24:15.360 --> 1:24:17.380\n It's not unbounded variation.\n\n1:24:17.380 --> 1:24:18.780\n And there are selectors.\n\n1:24:18.780 --> 1:24:22.540\n There are pressures that will select.\n\n1:24:22.540 --> 1:24:25.300\n And so not anything is possible\n\n1:24:25.300 --> 1:24:26.860\n because we live on a planet\n\n1:24:26.860 --> 1:24:30.220\n that has certain physical realities to it, right?\n\n1:24:31.220 --> 1:24:32.620\n But those physical realities\n\n1:24:32.620 --> 1:24:37.620\n are what constrain the possibilities, the physical realities\n\n1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:42.140\n of our genes and the physical realities\n\n1:24:42.140 --> 1:24:45.620\n of our corporeal bodies and the physical realities\n\n1:24:45.620 --> 1:24:50.620\n of life on this planet.\n\n1:24:51.060 --> 1:24:56.060\n So what I would say is that there's no direction,\n\n1:24:56.060 --> 1:25:01.060\n but there is, it's not infinite possibility\n\n1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:07.020\n because we live on a particular planet\n\n1:25:07.020 --> 1:25:10.220\n that has particular statistical regularities in it,\n\n1:25:10.220 --> 1:25:12.380\n and some things will never happen.\n\n1:25:12.380 --> 1:25:15.940\n And so all of those things are interacting\n\n1:25:15.940 --> 1:25:20.880\n with our genes and so on,\n\n1:25:20.880 --> 1:25:23.800\n and the physical nature of our bodies\n\n1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:25.480\n to make some things more possible\n\n1:25:25.480 --> 1:25:26.740\n and some things less possible.\n\n1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:29.340\n Look, I mean, humans have very complex brains,\n\n1:25:29.340 --> 1:25:31.060\n but birds have complex brains,\n\n1:25:31.060 --> 1:25:36.060\n and so do octopuses have very complex brains.\n\n1:25:37.240 --> 1:25:40.680\n And all three sets of all three of those brains\n\n1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:43.520\n are somewhat different from one another.\n\n1:25:45.580 --> 1:25:47.320\n Some birds have very complex brains.\n\n1:25:47.320 --> 1:25:48.820\n Some even have rudimentary language.\n\n1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:51.140\n They have no cerebral cortex.\n\n1:25:51.140 --> 1:25:53.160\n I mean, admittedly, they have,\n\n1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:54.900\n this is now lesson two, right?\n\n1:25:54.900 --> 1:25:56.580\n They have, is it lesson two or lesson one?\n\n1:25:56.580 --> 1:25:57.420\n Let me think.\n\n1:25:57.420 --> 1:25:58.900\n No, this is lesson one.\n\n1:25:58.900 --> 1:26:03.900\n They have the same neurons,\n\n1:26:05.460 --> 1:26:07.600\n the same neurons that in a human\n\n1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:09.300\n become the cerebral cortex.\n\n1:26:09.300 --> 1:26:10.980\n Birds have those neurons.\n\n1:26:10.980 --> 1:26:13.660\n They just don't form themselves into a cerebral cortex.\n\n1:26:13.660 --> 1:26:15.260\n But I mean, crows, for example,\n\n1:26:15.260 --> 1:26:17.140\n are very sophisticated animals.\n\n1:26:17.140 --> 1:26:19.780\n They can do a lot of the things that humans can do.\n\n1:26:19.780 --> 1:26:22.340\n In fact, all of the things that humans do\n\n1:26:22.340 --> 1:26:24.900\n that are very special, that seem very special,\n\n1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:26.940\n there's at least one other animal on the planet\n\n1:26:26.940 --> 1:26:29.040\n that can do those things too.\n\n1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:30.780\n What's special about the human brain\n\n1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:33.060\n is that we put them all together.\n\n1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:35.880\n So we learn from one another.\n\n1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:37.620\n We don't have to experience everything ourselves.\n\n1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:40.740\n We can watch another animal or another human\n\n1:26:40.740 --> 1:26:42.620\n experience something, and we can learn from that.\n\n1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:44.060\n Well, there are many other animals\n\n1:26:44.060 --> 1:26:45.800\n who can learn by copying.\n\n1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:47.540\n That we communicate with each other\n\n1:26:47.540 --> 1:26:48.620\n very, very efficiently.\n\n1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:49.460\n We have language.\n\n1:26:49.460 --> 1:26:51.080\n But we're not the only animals\n\n1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.900\n who are efficient communicators.\n\n1:26:52.900 --> 1:26:54.300\n There are lots of other animals\n\n1:26:54.300 --> 1:26:57.060\n who can efficiently communicate, like bees, for example.\n\n1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:00.560\n We cooperate really well with one another\n\n1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:01.720\n to do grand things.\n\n1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:03.420\n But there are other animals that cooperate too.\n\n1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:06.180\n And so every innovation that we have,\n\n1:27:06.180 --> 1:27:07.740\n other animals have too.\n\n1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:11.300\n What we have is we have all of those together\n\n1:27:11.300 --> 1:27:14.900\n interwoven in this very complex dance\n\n1:27:14.900 --> 1:27:19.900\n in a brain that is not unique exactly,\n\n1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:24.900\n but that is, it does have some features\n\n1:27:25.260 --> 1:27:29.900\n that make it particularly useful for us\n\n1:27:30.980 --> 1:27:32.540\n to do all of these things,\n\n1:27:33.660 --> 1:27:35.660\n to have all of these things intertwined.\n\n1:27:35.660 --> 1:27:40.580\n So our brains are, actually the last time we talked,\n\n1:27:40.580 --> 1:27:45.580\n I made a mistake because I said in my enthusiasm,\n\n1:27:45.580 --> 1:27:50.240\n I said, you know, our brains are not larger,\n\n1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:51.600\n or relative to our bodies,\n\n1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:55.760\n our brains are not larger than other primates.\n\n1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.760\n And that's actually not true, actually.\n\n1:27:57.760 --> 1:28:01.500\n Our brains relative to our body size is somewhat larger.\n\n1:28:01.500 --> 1:28:05.420\n So an ape who's not a human, that's not a human,\n\n1:28:06.560 --> 1:28:09.720\n their brains are larger than their body sizes\n\n1:28:09.720 --> 1:28:13.320\n than say, relative to like a smaller monkey.\n\n1:28:13.320 --> 1:28:17.240\n And a human's brain is larger relative to its body size\n\n1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:18.080\n than a gorilla.\n\n1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:22.100\n So that's a good approximation of your, of whatever,\n\n1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:25.180\n of the bunch of stuff that you can shove in there.\n\n1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:26.600\n But, well, what I was gonna say is,\n\n1:28:26.600 --> 1:28:29.560\n but our cerebral cortex is not larger\n\n1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:33.520\n than what you would expect for a brain of its size.\n\n1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:38.520\n So relative to say an ape, like a gorilla or a chimp,\n\n1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:43.520\n or even a mammal like a dolphin or an elephant, you know,\n\n1:28:44.620 --> 1:28:49.620\n our brains, our cerebral cortex is as large\n\n1:28:50.020 --> 1:28:53.900\n as you would expect it to be for a brain of our size.\n\n1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:57.780\n So there's nothing special about our cerebral cortex.\n\n1:28:57.780 --> 1:29:00.000\n And this is something I explain in the book,\n\n1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.080\n where I say, okay, you know, like by analogy,\n\n1:29:04.020 --> 1:29:05.400\n if you walk into somebody's house\n\n1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:08.100\n and you see that they have a huge kitchen,\n\n1:29:08.100 --> 1:29:11.620\n you might think, well, maybe this is a place\n\n1:29:11.620 --> 1:29:13.740\n I really definitely wanna eat dinner at\n\n1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:16.660\n because these people must be gourmet cooks.\n\n1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:17.500\n But you don't know anything\n\n1:29:17.500 --> 1:29:19.180\n about what the size of their kitchen means\n\n1:29:19.180 --> 1:29:20.800\n unless you consider it in relation\n\n1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:23.100\n to the size of the rest of the house.\n\n1:29:23.100 --> 1:29:26.580\n If it's a big kitchen in a really big house,\n\n1:29:26.580 --> 1:29:29.300\n it's not telling you anything special, right?\n\n1:29:29.300 --> 1:29:31.960\n If it's a big kitchen in a small house,\n\n1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:33.900\n then that might be a place that you wanna eat for,\n\n1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:36.740\n you wanna stay for dinner because it's more likely\n\n1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:39.380\n that that kitchen is large for a special reason.\n\n1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:43.660\n And so the cerebral cortex of a human brain\n\n1:29:43.660 --> 1:29:48.540\n isn't in and of itself special because of its size.\n\n1:29:48.540 --> 1:29:53.540\n However, there are some genetic changes\n\n1:29:53.700 --> 1:29:58.020\n that have happened in the human brain as it's grown\n\n1:30:00.060 --> 1:30:04.200\n to whatever size is typical for the whole brain size, right?\n\n1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:07.660\n There are some changes that do give the human brain\n\n1:30:07.660 --> 1:30:12.460\n slightly more of some capacities.\n\n1:30:12.460 --> 1:30:17.340\n They're not special, but we can do some things\n\n1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:21.620\n much better than other animals.\n\n1:30:21.620 --> 1:30:24.740\n And correspondingly, other animals can do some things\n\n1:30:24.740 --> 1:30:25.780\n much better than we can.\n\n1:30:25.780 --> 1:30:27.000\n We can't grow back limbs,\n\n1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.020\n we can't lift 50 times our own body weight.\n\n1:30:29.020 --> 1:30:30.040\n Well, I mean, maybe you can,\n\n1:30:30.040 --> 1:30:31.860\n but I can't lift 50 times my own body weight.\n\n1:30:31.860 --> 1:30:34.140\n Ants with that regard are very impressive.\n\n1:30:34.140 --> 1:30:36.900\n And then you're saying with the frontal cortex,\n\n1:30:36.900 --> 1:30:40.780\n like that's the size is not always the right measure\n\n1:30:40.780 --> 1:30:44.140\n of capability, I guess.\n\n1:30:44.140 --> 1:30:46.540\n So size isn't everything.\n\n1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:48.300\n Size isn't everything.\n\n1:30:48.300 --> 1:30:49.820\n That's a quoted book.\n\n1:30:49.820 --> 1:30:51.080\n People like it when I disagree,\n\n1:30:51.080 --> 1:30:53.820\n so let me disagree with you on something\n\n1:30:53.820 --> 1:30:56.380\n or just like play devil's advocate a little bit.\n\n1:30:56.380 --> 1:30:58.620\n So you've painted a really nice picture\n\n1:30:58.620 --> 1:31:03.620\n that evolution doesn't have a direction, but is it possible\n\n1:31:03.900 --> 1:31:06.380\n if we just ran Earth over and over again,\n\n1:31:06.380 --> 1:31:08.640\n like this video game,\n\n1:31:08.640 --> 1:31:11.820\n that the final result will be the same.\n\n1:31:11.820 --> 1:31:14.140\n So in the sense that we're,\n\n1:31:14.140 --> 1:31:17.220\n eventually there'll be an AGI type,\n\n1:31:17.220 --> 1:31:19.980\n HAL 9000 type system that just like flies\n\n1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:24.980\n and colonizes nearby Earth like planets.\n\n1:31:25.420 --> 1:31:26.900\n And it's always will be the same.\n\n1:31:26.900 --> 1:31:29.040\n And the different organisms\n\n1:31:29.040 --> 1:31:31.620\n and the different evolution of the brain,\n\n1:31:31.620 --> 1:31:35.180\n like it doesn't feel like it has like a direction,\n\n1:31:35.180 --> 1:31:37.380\n but given the constraints of Earth\n\n1:31:38.800 --> 1:31:40.640\n and whatever this imperative,\n\n1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:43.260\n whatever the hell is running this universe,\n\n1:31:43.260 --> 1:31:47.760\n like it seems like it's running towards something,\n\n1:31:47.760 --> 1:31:49.940\n is it possible that it will always be the same?\n\n1:31:49.940 --> 1:31:51.800\n Thereby it will be a direction.\n\n1:31:51.800 --> 1:31:56.800\n Yeah, I think as you know better than anyone else\n\n1:31:57.640 --> 1:31:59.280\n that the answer to that question is,\n\n1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:03.000\n of course there's some probability that could happen, right?\n\n1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:04.320\n It's not a yes or no answer.\n\n1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:07.580\n It's what's the probability that that would happen?\n\n1:32:07.580 --> 1:32:12.580\n And there's a whole distribution of possibilities.\n\n1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:17.400\n So maybe we end up, what's the probability we end up\n\n1:32:17.400 --> 1:32:21.600\n with exactly the same compliment of creatures,\n\n1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:22.680\n including us?\n\n1:32:22.680 --> 1:32:24.560\n What's the likelihood that we end up with\n\n1:32:27.040 --> 1:32:29.960\n creatures that are similar to humans,\n\n1:32:29.960 --> 1:32:33.080\n but similar in certain ways, let's say,\n\n1:32:33.080 --> 1:32:35.760\n but not exactly humans or all the way\n\n1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:40.760\n to a completely different distribution of creatures.\n\n1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:42.320\n What's the intuition?\n\n1:32:42.320 --> 1:32:43.880\n Like if you were to bet money,\n\n1:32:43.880 --> 1:32:45.440\n what does that distribution look like\n\n1:32:45.440 --> 1:32:47.320\n if we ran Earth over and over and over again?\n\n1:32:47.320 --> 1:32:51.200\n I would say given the, you're now asking me questions that.\n\n1:32:51.200 --> 1:32:52.240\n This is not science.\n\n1:32:52.240 --> 1:32:53.440\n This is not science.\n\n1:32:53.440 --> 1:32:54.640\n But I would say, okay, well,\n\n1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:59.000\n what's the probability that it's gonna be a carbon life form?\n\n1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:00.680\n Probably high.\n\n1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:03.920\n But that's because I don't know anything about really.\n\n1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:07.880\n Yeah, I'm not really well versed that.\n\n1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:09.360\n What's the probability that,\n\n1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:12.120\n so what's the probability that the animals will begin\n\n1:33:12.120 --> 1:33:14.720\n in the ocean and crawl out onto land?\n\n1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:15.560\n Versus the other way.\n\n1:33:15.560 --> 1:33:18.240\n Versus the, I would say probably high.\n\n1:33:19.280 --> 1:33:20.120\n I don't know.\n\n1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:22.760\n You know, but do I think what's the likelihood\n\n1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:26.720\n that we would end up with exactly the same or very similar?\n\n1:33:26.720 --> 1:33:28.640\n I think it's low actually.\n\n1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:32.120\n I wouldn't say it's low, but I would say it's not 100%.\n\n1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:34.520\n And I'm not even sure it's 50%.\n\n1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:36.400\n You know, I would say,\n\n1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:38.960\n I don't think that we're here by accident\n\n1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:41.680\n because I think, like I said, there are constraints.\n\n1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:44.760\n Like there are some physical constraints about Earth.\n\n1:33:44.760 --> 1:33:46.560\n Now, of course, if you were a cosmologist,\n\n1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:49.200\n you could say, well, the fact that the Earth is,\n\n1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:51.280\n if you were to do the Big Bang over again\n\n1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:53.040\n and keep doing it over and over and over again,\n\n1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:56.360\n would you still get the same solar systems?\n\n1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:58.240\n Would you still get the same planets?\n\n1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:00.840\n Would, you know, would you still get the same galaxies,\n\n1:34:00.840 --> 1:34:02.800\n the same solar systems, the same planets?\n\n1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:05.800\n You know, I don't know, but my guess is probably not\n\n1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:08.520\n because there are random things that happen\n\n1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:12.600\n that can, again, send things in one direct, you know,\n\n1:34:12.600 --> 1:34:14.520\n make one set of trajectories possible\n\n1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:15.880\n and another set impossible.\n\n1:34:15.880 --> 1:34:20.880\n So, but I guess my, if I were gonna bet money\n\n1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:28.080\n or something valuable, I would probably say,\n\n1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:31.480\n it's not zero and it's not 100%\n\n1:34:31.480 --> 1:34:33.280\n and it's probably not even 50%.\n\n1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:34.680\n So there's some probability, but I don't know.\n\n1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:35.520\n That it will be similar.\n\n1:34:35.520 --> 1:34:37.320\n That it will be similar, but I don't think,\n\n1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:40.560\n I just think there are too many degrees of freedom.\n\n1:34:40.560 --> 1:34:42.840\n There are too many degrees of freedom.\n\n1:34:42.840 --> 1:34:47.680\n I mean, one of the real tensions in writing this book\n\n1:34:47.680 --> 1:34:52.680\n is to, on the one hand, there's some truth in saying\n\n1:34:52.760 --> 1:34:57.720\n that humans are not special.\n\n1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:00.760\n We are just, you know,\n\n1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:03.040\n we're not special in the animal kingdom.\n\n1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.160\n All animals are well adapted.\n\n1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:11.120\n If they're survived, they're well adapted to their niche.\n\n1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:15.560\n It does happen to be the case that our niche is large.\n\n1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:18.400\n For any individual human, your niche is whatever it is.\n\n1:35:18.400 --> 1:35:20.080\n But for the species, right?\n\n1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:23.360\n We live almost everywhere, not everywhere,\n\n1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:28.360\n but almost everywhere on the planet, but not in the ocean.\n\n1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:32.360\n And actually other animals like bacteria, for example,\n\n1:35:32.360 --> 1:35:35.600\n have us beat miles, you know, hands down, right?\n\n1:35:35.600 --> 1:35:40.400\n So we're, by any definition,\n\n1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:41.760\n we're not special.\n\n1:35:43.560 --> 1:35:46.720\n We're just, you know, adapted to our environment.\n\n1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:48.360\n But bacteria don't have a podcast.\n\n1:35:48.360 --> 1:35:50.320\n Exactly, exactly.\n\n1:35:50.320 --> 1:35:53.080\n And so that's the other, so that's the tension, right?\n\n1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.320\n So on the one hand, you know, we're not special animals.\n\n1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:56.920\n We're just, you know,\n\n1:35:56.920 --> 1:35:58.240\n particularly well adapted to our niche.\n\n1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:00.040\n On the other hand, our niche is huge.\n\n1:36:00.040 --> 1:36:03.080\n And we, you know, we don't just adapt to our environment.\n\n1:36:03.080 --> 1:36:04.760\n We add to our environment.\n\n1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:06.920\n We make stuff up, give it a name,\n\n1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:08.480\n and then it becomes real.\n\n1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:10.800\n And so no other animal can do that.\n\n1:36:10.800 --> 1:36:13.440\n And so I think the thing,\n\n1:36:13.440 --> 1:36:15.360\n the way to think about it from my perspective\n\n1:36:15.360 --> 1:36:17.920\n or the way I made sense of it is to say,\n\n1:36:17.920 --> 1:36:21.840\n you can look at any individual single characteristic\n\n1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:26.440\n that a human has that seems remarkable.\n\n1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:28.680\n And you can find that in some other animal.\n\n1:36:30.120 --> 1:36:33.840\n What you can't find in any other animal\n\n1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:37.280\n is all of those characteristics together\n\n1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:42.280\n in a brain that is souped up in particular ways,\n\n1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:44.440\n like ours is.\n\n1:36:44.440 --> 1:36:46.360\n And if you combine these things,\n\n1:36:46.360 --> 1:36:48.840\n multiple interacting causes, right?\n\n1:36:48.840 --> 1:36:53.720\n Not one essence, like your cortex, your big neocortex,\n\n1:36:53.720 --> 1:36:56.160\n but which isn't really that big.\n\n1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:59.840\n I mean, it's just big for your big brain,\n\n1:36:59.840 --> 1:37:01.200\n for the size of your big brain.\n\n1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:02.840\n It's the size it should be.\n\n1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:05.960\n If you add all those things together\n\n1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:07.320\n and they interact with each other,\n\n1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:10.040\n that produces some pretty remarkable results.\n\n1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:13.080\n And if you're aware of that,\n\n1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:19.160\n then you can start asking different kinds of questions\n\n1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:22.560\n about what it means to be human\n\n1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:25.120\n and what kind of a human you wanna be\n\n1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:28.760\n and what kind of a world do you wanna curate\n\n1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.040\n for the next generation of humans.\n\n1:37:31.040 --> 1:37:33.720\n I think that's the goal anyways, right?\n\n1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:36.200\n Is just to have a glimpse of,\n\n1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:41.920\n instead of thinking about things in a simple linear way,\n\n1:37:42.760 --> 1:37:45.760\n just to have a glimpse of some of the things that matter,\n\n1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:49.040\n that evidence suggests matters\n\n1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:54.040\n to the kind of brain in the kind of bodies that we have.\n\n1:37:55.800 --> 1:37:58.720\n Once you know that, you can work with it a little bit.\n\n1:37:58.720 --> 1:38:02.040\n You write, words have power over your biology.\n\n1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:04.160\n Right now, I can text the words,\n\n1:38:04.160 --> 1:38:06.400\n I love you from the United States\n\n1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:08.480\n to my close friend in Belgium.\n\n1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:12.000\n And even though she cannot hear my voice or see my face,\n\n1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000\n I will change her heart rate, her breathing\n\n1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.640\n and her metabolism.\n\n1:38:16.640 --> 1:38:18.200\n By the way, beautifully written.\n\n1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:22.040\n Or someone could text something ambiguous to you,\n\n1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:24.680\n like, is your door locked?\n\n1:38:24.680 --> 1:38:27.360\n And odds are that it would affect your nervous system\n\n1:38:27.360 --> 1:38:29.480\n in an unpleasant way.\n\n1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:33.000\n So, I mean, there's a lot of stuff to talk about here,\n\n1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.960\n but just one way to ask is,\n\n1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.240\n why do you think words have so much power over our brain?\n\n1:38:43.080 --> 1:38:46.200\n Well, I think we just have to look at the anatomy\n\n1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:48.160\n of the brain to answer that question.\n\n1:38:48.160 --> 1:38:52.640\n So, if you look at the parts of the brain,\n\n1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:57.640\n the systems that are important for processing language,\n\n1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:01.640\n you can see that some of these regions\n\n1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:03.560\n are also important for controlling\n\n1:39:03.560 --> 1:39:05.160\n your major organ systems.\n\n1:39:05.160 --> 1:39:07.160\n And like your autonomic nervous system,\n\n1:39:07.160 --> 1:39:09.600\n that controls your cardiovascular system,\n\n1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:12.240\n your respiratory system, and so on.\n\n1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:17.240\n That these regions control your endocrine system,\n\n1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:20.240\n your immune system, and so on.\n\n1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:22.800\n So, and you can actually see this in other animals too.\n\n1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:24.760\n So in birds, for example,\n\n1:39:24.760 --> 1:39:28.080\n the neurons that are responsible for birdsong\n\n1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:30.840\n also control the systems of a bird's body.\n\n1:39:30.840 --> 1:39:33.640\n And the reason why I bring that up is that the,\n\n1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:38.640\n there's some scientists think that the anatomy\n\n1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:42.000\n of a bird's brain that control birdsong\n\n1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.760\n are homologous or structurally have a similar origin\n\n1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:48.360\n to the human system for language.\n\n1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:51.000\n So, the parts of the brain that are important\n\n1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:53.240\n for processing language are not unique\n\n1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:57.560\n in, and specialized for language.\n\n1:39:57.560 --> 1:39:59.160\n They do many things.\n\n1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:01.760\n And one of the things they do is control\n\n1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:03.680\n your major organ systems.\n\n1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:05.240\n Do you think we can fall in love,\n\n1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:07.840\n I have arguments about this all the time.\n\n1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:10.560\n Do you think we can fall in love based on words alone?\n\n1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:14.000\n Well, I think people have been doing it for centuries.\n\n1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:15.480\n I mean, maybe it used to be the case\n\n1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.520\n that people wrote letters to each other,\n\n1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:22.160\n you know, and then that was how they communicated.\n\n1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:24.160\n I guess that's how you and Dan got it.\n\n1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:26.400\n Exactly, exactly, exactly.\n\n1:40:26.400 --> 1:40:28.040\n Yeah, exactly.\n\n1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:31.120\n So is the answer a clear yes there?\n\n1:40:31.120 --> 1:40:34.040\n Because I get a lot of pushback from people often\n\n1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:37.840\n that you need the touch and the smell\n\n1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:42.120\n and, you know, the bodily stuff.\n\n1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:45.560\n I think the touch and the smell and the bodily stuff helps.\n\n1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:46.400\n Okay.\n\n1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:47.880\n But I don't think it's necessary.\n\n1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:51.920\n Do you think you can have a lifelong monogamous relationship\n\n1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:54.560\n with an AI system that only communicates\n\n1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:56.800\n with you on text, romantic relationship?\n\n1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:00.800\n Well, I suppose that's an empirical question\n\n1:41:00.800 --> 1:41:02.080\n that hasn't been answered yet.\n\n1:41:02.080 --> 1:41:04.880\n But I guess what I would say is\n\n1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:09.280\n I don't think I could.\n\n1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:12.680\n Could any human?\n\n1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:14.400\n Could the average human?\n\n1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:18.000\n Could, you know, so if I,\n\n1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:23.000\n if I even, I wanna even modify that and say,\n\n1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:30.520\n I'm thinking now of Tom Hanks and the movie.\n\n1:41:31.080 --> 1:41:31.920\n Castaway?\n\n1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:33.280\n Yeah, you know, with Wilson.\n\n1:41:33.280 --> 1:41:34.120\n Yeah.\n\n1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:37.440\n I think if that was, if you had to make that work,\n\n1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:39.040\n if you had to make that work.\n\n1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:40.400\n With a volleyball, yeah.\n\n1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:43.160\n If you had to make it work, could you,\n\n1:41:43.160 --> 1:41:45.280\n could you, prediction and simulation, right?\n\n1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:49.480\n So if you had to make it work, could you make it work?\n\n1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:53.400\n Using simulation and, you know, your past experience,\n\n1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:54.560\n could you make it work?\n\n1:41:56.280 --> 1:41:57.120\n Could you make it work?\n\n1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.800\n You as a human, could you, could you like?\n\n1:41:59.800 --> 1:42:01.920\n Could you have a relationship literally\n\n1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:04.640\n with an inanimate object and have it sustain you\n\n1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:07.760\n in the way that another human could?\n\n1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:11.000\n Your life would probably be shorter\n\n1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.920\n because you wouldn't actually derive\n\n1:42:12.920 --> 1:42:15.400\n the body budgeting benefits from, right?\n\n1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:20.400\n So we've talked about, you know, how your brain,\n\n1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:24.200\n its most important job is to control your body\n\n1:42:24.200 --> 1:42:27.080\n and you can describe that as your brain running a budget\n\n1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:31.840\n for your body and there are metaphorical, you know,\n\n1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:34.640\n deposits and withdrawals into your body budget\n\n1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:37.400\n and you also make deposits and withdrawals\n\n1:42:37.400 --> 1:42:40.360\n in other people's body budgets, figuratively speaking.\n\n1:42:40.360 --> 1:42:43.800\n So you wouldn't have that particular benefit.\n\n1:42:45.880 --> 1:42:48.280\n So your life would probably be shorter\n\n1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.040\n but I think it would be harder for some people\n\n1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:52.360\n than for other people.\n\n1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:54.320\n Yeah, I tend to, my intuition is that you can have\n\n1:42:54.320 --> 1:42:57.860\n a deep fulfilling relationship with a volleyball.\n\n1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:03.560\n I think, I think a lot of the, the environments\n\n1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:05.440\n that set up, I think that's a really good example.\n\n1:43:05.440 --> 1:43:10.440\n Like the constraints of your particular environment\n\n1:43:11.200 --> 1:43:16.200\n define the, like I believe like scarcity is a good catalyst\n\n1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:20.000\n for deep, meaningful connection with other humans\n\n1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:22.000\n and with inanimate objects.\n\n1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.680\n So the less you have, the more fulfilling\n\n1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:25.880\n those relationships are.\n\n1:43:25.880 --> 1:43:29.240\n And I would say a relationship with a volleyball,\n\n1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:31.640\n the sex is not great but everything else,\n\n1:43:31.640 --> 1:43:34.640\n I feel like it could be a very fulfilling relationship\n\n1:43:34.640 --> 1:43:37.240\n which I don't know from an engineering perspective\n\n1:43:37.240 --> 1:43:38.760\n what to do with that.\n\n1:43:38.760 --> 1:43:41.520\n And just like you said, it is an empirical question but.\n\n1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:43.560\n But there are places to learn about that, right?\n\n1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:48.140\n So for example, think about children and their blankets.\n\n1:43:49.100 --> 1:43:51.220\n Right, so there, there's something tactile\n\n1:43:51.220 --> 1:43:55.340\n and there's something olfactory and it's very comforting.\n\n1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:00.180\n I mean, even for, even for nonhuman little animals, right?\n\n1:44:00.180 --> 1:44:04.480\n Like puppies and so I don't know about cats but, but.\n\n1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:07.600\n Cats are cold hearted, there's no,\n\n1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:08.800\n there's nothing going on there.\n\n1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:12.000\n I don't know, there are some cats that are very doglike.\n\n1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.040\n I mean, really, so.\n\n1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:15.800\n Some cats identify as dogs, yes.\n\n1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:19.100\n I think that's true, yeah, they're species fluid.\n\n1:44:21.360 --> 1:44:26.120\n So you also write, when it comes to human minds,\n\n1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:28.080\n variation is the norm.\n\n1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:30.400\n And what we call quote, human nature\n\n1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:32.740\n is really many human natures.\n\n1:44:32.740 --> 1:44:36.260\n So again, many questions I can ask here.\n\n1:44:36.260 --> 1:44:41.260\n But maybe an interesting one to ask is I often hear,\n\n1:44:41.620 --> 1:44:43.780\n we often hear this idea of be yourself.\n\n1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:48.120\n Is this possible to be yourself?\n\n1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.500\n Is it a good idea to strive to be yourself?\n\n1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:54.460\n Is it, does that even have any meaning?\n\n1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:57.320\n It's a very Western question, first of all,\n\n1:44:57.320 --> 1:44:59.500\n because which self are you talking about?\n\n1:45:00.780 --> 1:45:01.860\n You don't have one self.\n\n1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:04.540\n There is no self that's an essence of you.\n\n1:45:04.540 --> 1:45:05.960\n You have multiple selves.\n\n1:45:05.960 --> 1:45:08.360\n Actually, there is research on this.\n\n1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:13.300\n To quote the great social psychologist, Hazel Marcus,\n\n1:45:13.300 --> 1:45:15.880\n you're never, you cannot be a self by yourself.\n\n1:45:18.700 --> 1:45:22.000\n And so different contexts pull for\n\n1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:26.820\n or draw on different features of who you are\n\n1:45:26.820 --> 1:45:31.820\n or what you believe, what you feel, what your actions are.\n\n1:45:32.020 --> 1:45:35.100\n A different context will put certain things,\n\n1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:38.060\n make some features be more in the foreground\n\n1:45:38.060 --> 1:45:39.820\n and some in the background.\n\n1:45:39.820 --> 1:45:42.060\n It takes us back right to our discussion earlier\n\n1:45:42.060 --> 1:45:46.060\n about Stalin and Hitler and so on.\n\n1:45:46.060 --> 1:45:48.500\n The thing that I would caution,\n\n1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:51.660\n in addition to the fact that there is no single self,\n\n1:45:51.660 --> 1:45:54.300\n that you have multiple selves, who you can be,\n\n1:45:54.300 --> 1:45:59.040\n and you can certainly choose the situations\n\n1:45:59.040 --> 1:46:01.200\n that you put yourself in to some extent.\n\n1:46:01.200 --> 1:46:02.860\n Not everybody has complete choice,\n\n1:46:02.860 --> 1:46:04.440\n but everybody has a little bit of choice.\n\n1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:06.400\n And I think I said this to you before,\n\n1:46:06.400 --> 1:46:10.600\n that one of the pieces of advice that we gave Sophia\n\n1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:11.920\n when she went, our daughter,\n\n1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:13.280\n when she was going off to college,\n\n1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:18.280\n was try to spend time around people,\n\n1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:21.240\n choose relationships that allow you to be your best self.\n\n1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:26.240\n We should have said your best selves, but, you know.\n\n1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:31.600\n The pool of selves given the environment.\n\n1:46:31.600 --> 1:46:34.080\n Yeah, but the one thing I do wanna say\n\n1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:38.320\n is that the risk of saying be yourself, just be yourself,\n\n1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:42.440\n is that that can be used as an excuse.\n\n1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:45.540\n Well, this is just the way that I am, I'm just like this.\n\n1:46:45.540 --> 1:46:50.540\n And that, I think, should be tremendously resisted.\n\n1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:54.360\n So that's one, that's for the excuse side,\n\n1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:57.640\n but, you know, I'm really self critical often,\n\n1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:00.600\n I'm full of doubt, and people often tell me,\n\n1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:04.120\n just don't worry about it, just be yourself, man.\n\n1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:07.520\n And it's, the thing is, it almost,\n\n1:47:07.520 --> 1:47:09.880\n it's not, from an engineering perspective,\n\n1:47:09.880 --> 1:47:12.480\n does not seem like actionable advice.\n\n1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:17.480\n Because, I guess, constantly worrying about who,\n\n1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:24.080\n what are the right words to say\n\n1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:29.080\n to express how I'm feeling is, I guess, myself.\n\n1:47:30.040 --> 1:47:32.020\n There's a kind of line, I guess,\n\n1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:34.520\n that this might be a Western idea,\n\n1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:37.560\n but something that feels genuine\n\n1:47:37.560 --> 1:47:39.380\n and something that feels non genuine.\n\n1:47:39.380 --> 1:47:42.620\n And I'm not sure what that means,\n\n1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:45.820\n because I would like to be fully genuine and fully open,\n\n1:47:45.820 --> 1:47:49.180\n but I'm also aware, like this morning,\n\n1:47:49.180 --> 1:47:52.220\n I was very silly and giddy, I was like,\n\n1:47:52.220 --> 1:47:57.220\n this is just being funny and relaxed and light,\n\n1:47:57.300 --> 1:48:01.140\n like there's nothing that could bother me in the world,\n\n1:48:01.140 --> 1:48:02.700\n I was just smiling and happy.\n\n1:48:02.700 --> 1:48:04.100\n And then I remember last night,\n\n1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:05.980\n was just feeling very grumpy,\n\n1:48:05.980 --> 1:48:09.100\n like stuff was bothering me.\n\n1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:10.780\n Like certain things were bothering me.\n\n1:48:10.780 --> 1:48:12.660\n And like, what are those?\n\n1:48:12.660 --> 1:48:14.500\n Are those different selves?\n\n1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:16.940\n Like what, who am I in that?\n\n1:48:16.940 --> 1:48:17.780\n And what do I do?\n\n1:48:17.780 --> 1:48:20.520\n Because if we take Twitter as an example,\n\n1:48:20.520 --> 1:48:23.220\n if I actually send a tweet last night\n\n1:48:23.220 --> 1:48:24.340\n and a tweet this morning,\n\n1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:28.900\n it's gonna be very two different people tweeting that.\n\n1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:30.560\n And I don't know what to do with that,\n\n1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:34.980\n because one does seem to be more me than the other,\n\n1:48:34.980 --> 1:48:38.280\n but that's maybe because there's a story that I'm trying,\n\n1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:40.460\n there's something I'm striving to be,\n\n1:48:40.460 --> 1:48:43.200\n like the ultimate human that I might become,\n\n1:48:43.200 --> 1:48:44.580\n I have maybe a vision of that,\n\n1:48:44.580 --> 1:48:46.460\n and I'm trying to become that.\n\n1:48:46.460 --> 1:48:48.960\n But it does seem like there's a lot\n\n1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:50.420\n of different minds in there.\n\n1:48:51.300 --> 1:48:54.460\n And they're all like having a discussion\n\n1:48:54.460 --> 1:48:56.780\n and a battle for who's gonna win.\n\n1:48:56.780 --> 1:48:58.180\n I suppose you could think of it that way,\n\n1:48:58.180 --> 1:49:00.140\n but there's another way to think of it, I think,\n\n1:49:00.140 --> 1:49:03.740\n and that is that maybe the more Buddhist way to think of it,\n\n1:49:03.740 --> 1:49:05.740\n right, or a more contemplative way to think about it,\n\n1:49:05.740 --> 1:49:08.800\n which is not that you have multiple personalities\n\n1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:11.820\n inside your head, but you have,\n\n1:49:11.820 --> 1:49:16.820\n your brain has this amazing capacity.\n\n1:49:18.940 --> 1:49:23.940\n It has a population of experiences that you've had\n\n1:49:24.580 --> 1:49:27.820\n that it can regenerate, reconstitute.\n\n1:49:27.820 --> 1:49:32.700\n And it can even take bits and pieces of those experiences\n\n1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:35.940\n and combine them into something new.\n\n1:49:35.940 --> 1:49:39.180\n And it's often doing this to predict\n\n1:49:39.180 --> 1:49:42.240\n what's going to happen next and to plan your actions,\n\n1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.340\n but it's also happening, this also happens just,\n\n1:49:46.340 --> 1:49:47.860\n that's what mind wandering is,\n\n1:49:47.860 --> 1:49:50.240\n or just internal thought and so on.\n\n1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:52.300\n It's the same mechanism, really.\n\n1:49:52.300 --> 1:49:57.060\n And so a lot of times we hear the saying,\n\n1:49:57.060 --> 1:49:58.860\n just think, if you think differently,\n\n1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:00.860\n you'll feel differently.\n\n1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:04.900\n But your brain is having a conversation continually\n\n1:50:04.900 --> 1:50:08.100\n with your body, and your body,\n\n1:50:08.100 --> 1:50:10.660\n your brain's trying to control your body,\n\n1:50:10.660 --> 1:50:13.020\n well, trying, your brain is controlling your body,\n\n1:50:13.020 --> 1:50:16.140\n your body is sending information back to the brain,\n\n1:50:16.140 --> 1:50:19.780\n and in part, the information that your body sends back\n\n1:50:19.780 --> 1:50:23.620\n to your brain, just like the information\n\n1:50:23.620 --> 1:50:27.780\n coming from the world, initiates the next volley\n\n1:50:27.780 --> 1:50:30.300\n of predictions or simulations.\n\n1:50:30.300 --> 1:50:32.340\n So in some ways, you could also say,\n\n1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:37.300\n the way that you feel, I think we talked before\n\n1:50:37.300 --> 1:50:40.220\n about affective feeling or mood,\n\n1:50:40.220 --> 1:50:43.260\n coming from the sensations of body budgeting,\n\n1:50:46.060 --> 1:50:48.960\n influences what you think.\n\n1:50:50.300 --> 1:50:54.840\n And as much as, so feelings influence thought,\n\n1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:58.740\n as much as thought influence feeling, and maybe more.\n\n1:50:58.740 --> 1:51:01.460\n But just the whole thing doesn't seem stable.\n\n1:51:01.460 --> 1:51:05.480\n Well, it's a dynamic system, Mr. Engineer, right?\n\n1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:07.740\n It's a dynamic, it's a dynamical system, right?\n\n1:51:07.740 --> 1:51:09.380\n Nonlinear dynamical system.\n\n1:51:09.380 --> 1:51:11.780\n And I think that's, I'm actually writing a paper\n\n1:51:11.780 --> 1:51:14.980\n with a bunch of engineers about this actually.\n\n1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:17.540\n But I mean, other people have talked about the brain\n\n1:51:17.540 --> 1:51:18.860\n as a dynamical system before,\n\n1:51:18.860 --> 1:51:22.260\n but the real tricky bit is trying to figure out\n\n1:51:22.260 --> 1:51:24.900\n how do you get mental features out of that system?\n\n1:51:24.900 --> 1:51:26.220\n I guess one thing to figure out how you get\n\n1:51:26.220 --> 1:51:27.760\n a motor movement out of that system,\n\n1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:28.940\n it's another thing to figure out\n\n1:51:28.940 --> 1:51:30.380\n how you get a mental feature,\n\n1:51:30.380 --> 1:51:32.900\n like a feeling of being loved\n\n1:51:32.900 --> 1:51:34.860\n or a feeling of being worthwhile,\n\n1:51:34.860 --> 1:51:38.620\n or a feeling of just basically feeling like shit.\n\n1:51:38.620 --> 1:51:39.740\n How do you get a feeling,\n\n1:51:39.740 --> 1:51:42.860\n a mental features out of that system?\n\n1:51:43.940 --> 1:51:48.020\n So what I would say is that you aren't,\n\n1:51:48.020 --> 1:51:50.780\n the Buddhist thing to say is that you're not one person\n\n1:51:50.780 --> 1:51:52.300\n and you're not many people.\n\n1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:57.300\n You are the sum of your experiences\n\n1:51:58.240 --> 1:52:00.860\n and who you are in any given moment,\n\n1:52:02.080 --> 1:52:05.000\n meaning what your actions will be,\n\n1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.680\n is influenced by the state of your body\n\n1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.240\n and the state of the world that you've put yourself in.\n\n1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:12.880\n And you can change either of those things.\n\n1:52:12.880 --> 1:52:15.200\n One is a little easier to change than the other, right?\n\n1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:16.640\n You can change your environment\n\n1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:18.960\n by literally getting up and moving,\n\n1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:21.000\n or you can change it by paying attention\n\n1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:22.320\n to some things differently\n\n1:52:22.320 --> 1:52:26.080\n and letting some features come to the fore\n\n1:52:26.080 --> 1:52:28.000\n and other features be backgrounded.\n\n1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.040\n Like I'm looking around your place.\n\n1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:32.600\n Oh no, this is not something you should do.\n\n1:52:32.600 --> 1:52:34.960\n No, but I'm gonna say one thing.\n\n1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:39.640\n No green plants, no green plants.\n\n1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:41.380\n Because green plants mean a home\n\n1:52:41.380 --> 1:52:43.160\n and I want this to be temporary.\n\n1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:45.880\n Fair, fair, but.\n\n1:52:45.880 --> 1:52:48.480\n What goes to your mind when you see no green plants?\n\n1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:53.480\n No, I'm just making the point that what if you,\n\n1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:59.280\n again, not everybody has control over their environment.\n\n1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:01.520\n Some people don't have control over the noise\n\n1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:04.520\n or the temperature or any of those things.\n\n1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:07.100\n But everybody has a little bit of control\n\n1:53:07.100 --> 1:53:10.280\n and you can place things in your environment,\n\n1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:15.280\n photographs, plants, anything that's meaningful to you\n\n1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:19.360\n and use it as a shift of environment when you need it.\n\n1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:21.680\n You can also do things to change\n\n1:53:21.680 --> 1:53:24.000\n the conditions of your body.\n\n1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:25.760\n When you exercise every day,\n\n1:53:25.760 --> 1:53:28.880\n you're making an investment in your body.\n\n1:53:28.880 --> 1:53:31.280\n Actually, you're making an investment in your brain too.\n\n1:53:31.280 --> 1:53:33.880\n It makes you, even though it's unpleasant\n\n1:53:33.880 --> 1:53:37.280\n and there's a cost to it, if you replenish,\n\n1:53:37.280 --> 1:53:39.680\n if you invest and you make up that,\n\n1:53:39.680 --> 1:53:44.280\n you make a deposit and you make up what you've spent,\n\n1:53:44.280 --> 1:53:46.320\n you're basically making an investment\n\n1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:48.880\n in making it easier for your brain\n\n1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:51.360\n to control your body in the future.\n\n1:53:51.360 --> 1:53:54.600\n So you can make sure you're hydrated.\n\n1:53:54.600 --> 1:53:55.640\n Drink water.\n\n1:53:55.640 --> 1:53:57.040\n You don't have to drink bottled water.\n\n1:53:57.040 --> 1:53:58.600\n You can drink water from the tap.\n\n1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:01.680\n This is in most places, maybe not everywhere,\n\n1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:06.280\n but most places in the developed world.\n\n1:54:06.280 --> 1:54:09.640\n You can try to get enough sleep.\n\n1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:11.240\n Not everybody has that luxury,\n\n1:54:11.240 --> 1:54:16.240\n but everybody can do something to make their body budgets\n\n1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:17.880\n a little more solvent.\n\n1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:21.680\n And that will also make it more likely\n\n1:54:21.680 --> 1:54:23.640\n that certain thoughts will emerge\n\n1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:27.040\n from that prediction machine, basically.\n\n1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:28.840\n That's the control you do have,\n\n1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.440\n is being able to control the environment.\n\n1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:32.440\n That's really well put.\n\n1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:36.760\n I don't think we've talked about this,\n\n1:54:36.760 --> 1:54:39.040\n so let's go to the biggest unanswerable questions\n\n1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:41.360\n of consciousness.\n\n1:54:41.360 --> 1:54:43.880\n What is, you just rolled your eyes.\n\n1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:45.720\n I did, that was my, yeah.\n\n1:54:45.720 --> 1:54:49.000\n So what is consciousness from a neuroscience perspective?\n\n1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:50.160\n I know you, I mean.\n\n1:54:52.760 --> 1:54:54.240\n I made notes, you know,\n\n1:54:54.240 --> 1:54:56.440\n because you gave me some questions in advance\n\n1:54:56.440 --> 1:54:58.120\n and I made notes for every single.\n\n1:54:58.120 --> 1:54:58.960\n Oh, except that one?\n\n1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:01.240\n Yeah, well that one I had, what the fuck?\n\n1:55:01.240 --> 1:55:02.440\n And then I took it out.\n\n1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:05.960\n So is there something interesting,\n\n1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:07.560\n because you're so pragmatic.\n\n1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:10.960\n Is there something interesting to say about intuition\n\n1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:13.240\n building about consciousness?\n\n1:55:13.240 --> 1:55:16.240\n Or is this something that we're just totally clueless about\n\n1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.640\n that this is, let's focus on the body,\n\n1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.120\n the brain listens to the body,\n\n1:55:22.120 --> 1:55:24.520\n the body speaks to the brain,\n\n1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:26.920\n and let's just figure this piece out,\n\n1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:29.160\n and then consciousness will probably emerge somehow\n\n1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:30.440\n after that.\n\n1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:33.080\n No, I think, you know, well, first of all,\n\n1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:35.120\n I'll just say up front,\n\n1:55:35.120 --> 1:55:37.640\n I am not a philosopher of consciousness\n\n1:55:37.640 --> 1:55:40.360\n and I'm not a neuroscientist who focuses on consciousness.\n\n1:55:40.360 --> 1:55:41.880\n I mean, in some sense, I do study it\n\n1:55:41.880 --> 1:55:44.480\n because I study affect and mood.\n\n1:55:44.480 --> 1:55:46.520\n And that is the,\n\n1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:50.920\n you know, to use the phrase,\n\n1:55:50.920 --> 1:55:54.080\n that is the hard question of consciousness.\n\n1:55:54.080 --> 1:55:57.960\n How is it that your brain is modeling your body?\n\n1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:00.720\n Brain is modeling the sensory conditions of your body.\n\n1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:03.840\n And it's being updated,\n\n1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:06.400\n that model is being updated by the sense data\n\n1:56:06.400 --> 1:56:07.760\n that's coming from your body\n\n1:56:07.760 --> 1:56:10.080\n and it's happening continuously your whole life.\n\n1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:15.560\n And you don't feel those sensations directly.\n\n1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:19.120\n What you feel is a general sense of pleasantness\n\n1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.120\n or unpleasantness, comfort, discomfort,\n\n1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:22.320\n feeling worked up, feeling calm.\n\n1:56:22.320 --> 1:56:26.360\n So we call that affect, you know, most people call it mood.\n\n1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:28.840\n So how is it that your brain gives you\n\n1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:33.720\n this very low dimensional feeling of mood or affect\n\n1:56:33.720 --> 1:56:35.760\n when it's presumably receiving\n\n1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:39.120\n a very high dimensional array of sense data?\n\n1:56:39.120 --> 1:56:42.520\n And the model that the brain is running of the body\n\n1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:44.400\n has to be high dimensional\n\n1:56:44.400 --> 1:56:47.680\n because there's a lot going on in there, right?\n\n1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:49.840\n You're not aware, but as you're sitting there quietly,\n\n1:56:49.840 --> 1:56:54.440\n as your listeners or as our viewers are sitting.\n\n1:56:54.440 --> 1:56:56.360\n They might be working out, running now,\n\n1:56:56.360 --> 1:56:57.880\n or as many of them write to me.\n\n1:56:57.880 --> 1:56:58.720\n That's fair.\n\n1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:00.160\n They're laying in bed, smoking weed\n\n1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:01.880\n with their eyes closed.\n\n1:57:01.880 --> 1:57:05.040\n That's fair, so maybe we should say that bit again then.\n\n1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:07.800\n So if, so some people may be working out,\n\n1:57:07.800 --> 1:57:11.280\n some people may be, you know, relaxing.\n\n1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:14.120\n But you know, even if you're sitting very still\n\n1:57:14.120 --> 1:57:16.920\n while you're watching this or listening to this,\n\n1:57:16.920 --> 1:57:19.600\n there's a whole drama going on inside your body\n\n1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:21.400\n that you're largely unaware of.\n\n1:57:21.400 --> 1:57:26.200\n Yet your brain makes you aware\n\n1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:29.600\n or gives you a status report in a sense\n\n1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:31.600\n by virtue of these mental features\n\n1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:33.600\n of feeling pleasant, feeling unpleasant,\n\n1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:35.320\n feeling comfortable, feeling uncomfortable,\n\n1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:38.080\n feeling energetic, feeling tired and so on.\n\n1:57:38.080 --> 1:57:41.240\n And so how the hell is it doing that?\n\n1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:46.240\n That is the basic question of consciousness.\n\n1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:49.200\n And like the status reports seem to be,\n\n1:57:49.200 --> 1:57:52.480\n in the way we experience them, seem to be quite simple.\n\n1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:56.560\n Like it doesn't feel like there's a lot of data.\n\n1:57:56.560 --> 1:57:57.640\n Yeah, no, there isn't.\n\n1:57:57.640 --> 1:58:02.640\n So when you feel, when you feel discomfort,\n\n1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:04.840\n when you're feeling basically like shit,\n\n1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:06.960\n you feel like shit, what does that tell you?\n\n1:58:06.960 --> 1:58:08.360\n Like, what are you supposed to do next?\n\n1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:09.320\n What caused it?\n\n1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:12.160\n I mean, the thing is not one thing caused it, right?\n\n1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:15.560\n It's multiple factors probably influencing\n\n1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:16.920\n your physical state.\n\n1:58:16.920 --> 1:58:17.760\n Your body budget.\n\n1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:18.600\n It's very high dimensional, yeah.\n\n1:58:18.600 --> 1:58:20.200\n It's very high dimensional.\n\n1:58:20.200 --> 1:58:25.200\n And there are different temporal scales of influence, right?\n\n1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:33.000\n So the state of your gut is not just influenced\n\n1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:34.680\n by what you ate five minutes ago.\n\n1:58:34.680 --> 1:58:37.600\n It's also what you ate a day ago and two days ago\n\n1:58:37.600 --> 1:58:38.480\n and so on.\n\n1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:43.480\n So I think the, you know,\n\n1:58:43.480 --> 1:58:48.480\n when I'm, I'm not trying to weasel out of the question,\n\n1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:55.120\n I just think it's the hardest question actually.\n\n1:58:55.120 --> 1:58:58.120\n Do you think we'll ever understand it as scientists?\n\n1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:06.680\n I think that we will understand it\n\n1:59:06.680 --> 1:59:09.720\n as well as we understand other things\n\n1:59:09.720 --> 1:59:14.720\n like the birth of the universe or the, you know,\n\n1:59:15.320 --> 1:59:18.200\n the nature of the universe, I guess I would say.\n\n1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:21.920\n So do I think we can get to that level of an explanation?\n\n1:59:21.920 --> 1:59:24.880\n I do actually, but I think that we have to start asking\n\n1:59:24.880 --> 1:59:28.080\n somewhat different questions and approaching the science\n\n1:59:28.080 --> 1:59:30.280\n somewhat differently than we have in the past.\n\n1:59:30.280 --> 1:59:32.040\n I mean, it's also possible that consciousness\n\n1:59:32.040 --> 1:59:33.600\n is much more difficult to understand\n\n1:59:33.600 --> 1:59:35.320\n than the nature of the universe.\n\n1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:37.680\n It is, but I wasn't necessarily saying\n\n1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:40.800\n that it was a question that was of equivalent complexity.\n\n1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:44.160\n I was saying that I do think that we could get\n\n1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:49.160\n to some, I am optimistic that I would not,\n\n1:59:51.040 --> 1:59:54.520\n I would be very willing to invest the time,\n\n1:59:54.520 --> 1:59:57.040\n my time on this earth as a scientist\n\n1:59:57.040 --> 1:59:58.400\n in trying to answer that question\n\n1:59:58.400 --> 2:00:01.920\n if I could do it the way that I wanna do it,\n\n2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:04.400\n not in the way that it's currently being done.\n\n2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:05.600\n So like rigorously?\n\n2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:06.960\n I don't wanna say unrigorously.\n\n2:00:06.960 --> 2:00:09.400\n I just wanna say that there are certain set of assumptions\n\n2:00:09.400 --> 2:00:11.720\n that, you know, scientists have\n\n2:00:11.720 --> 2:00:13.760\n what I would call ontological commitments.\n\n2:00:13.760 --> 2:00:16.120\n They're commitments about the way the world is\n\n2:00:16.120 --> 2:00:18.720\n or the way that nature is.\n\n2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:23.720\n And these commitments lead scientists sometimes blindly\n\n2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:25.200\n without, they don't, scientists sometimes,\n\n2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:27.000\n sometimes scientists are aware of these commitments,\n\n2:00:27.000 --> 2:00:28.360\n but sometimes they're not.\n\n2:00:28.360 --> 2:00:30.600\n And these commitments on the list influence\n\n2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:34.560\n how scientists ask questions, what they measure,\n\n2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:39.560\n how they measure, and I just have very different views\n\n2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:43.160\n than a lot of my colleagues about the ways to approach this.\n\n2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:46.400\n Not everybody, but the way that I would approach it\n\n2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:50.360\n would be different and it would cost more\n\n2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:52.600\n and it would take longer.\n\n2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:54.280\n It doesn't fit very well\n\n2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:56.360\n into the current incentive structure of science.\n\n2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:59.120\n And so do I think that doing science\n\n2:00:59.120 --> 2:01:00.520\n the way science is currently done\n\n2:01:00.520 --> 2:01:02.280\n with the budget that it currently has\n\n2:01:02.280 --> 2:01:04.240\n and the incentive structure that it currently has\n\n2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:05.280\n will we have an answer?\n\n2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:06.800\n No, I think absolutely not.\n\n2:01:06.800 --> 2:01:08.160\n Good luck is what I would say.\n\n2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:12.520\n People love book recommendations.\n\n2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:14.640\n Let me ask what three books.\n\n2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:17.200\n Oh, you can't just like, you can't just give me three.\n\n2:01:17.200 --> 2:01:18.640\n I mean, like really three?\n\n2:01:18.640 --> 2:01:22.560\n What seven and a half books you can recommend.\n\n2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:24.600\n So you're also the author of seven and a half lessons\n\n2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.080\n about the brain.\n\n2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.240\n You're a author of how emotions are made.\n\n2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:32.760\n Okay, so definitely those are the top two recommendations\n\n2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:35.240\n of all, the two greatest books of all time.\n\n2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:38.440\n Other than that, are there books that technical,\n\n2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:41.080\n fiction, philosophical that you've enjoyed\n\n2:01:41.080 --> 2:01:42.720\n or you might recommend to others?\n\n2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:46.840\n Yes, actually, you know, every PhD student\n\n2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:50.360\n when they graduate with their PhD,\n\n2:01:50.360 --> 2:01:52.880\n I give them a set, like a little library,\n\n2:01:52.880 --> 2:01:54.240\n like a set of books, you know,\n\n2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:55.920\n some of which they've already read,\n\n2:01:55.920 --> 2:01:58.040\n some of which I want them to read or,\n\n2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:03.040\n but I think nonfiction books, I would read,\n\n2:02:03.520 --> 2:02:07.680\n the things I would recommend are The Triple Helix\n\n2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:10.280\n by Richard Lewontin.\n\n2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:14.080\n It's a little book published in 2000,\n\n2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:17.520\n which is, I think, a really good introduction\n\n2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:22.520\n to complexity and population thinking\n\n2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:25.160\n as opposed to essentialism.\n\n2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:27.200\n So this idea, essentialism is this idea\n\n2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:29.920\n that, you know, there's an essence to each person,\n\n2:02:29.920 --> 2:02:32.880\n whether it's a soul or your genes or what have you,\n\n2:02:32.880 --> 2:02:35.440\n as opposed to this idea that you,\n\n2:02:35.440 --> 2:02:38.160\n we have the kind of nature that requires a nurture.\n\n2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:43.160\n We are, we are, you are the product of a complex dance\n\n2:02:43.480 --> 2:02:47.680\n between an environment, between a set of genes\n\n2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:52.080\n and an environment that turns those genes on and off\n\n2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:53.920\n to produce your brain and your body\n\n2:02:53.920 --> 2:02:56.640\n and really who you are at any given moment.\n\n2:02:56.640 --> 2:02:59.240\n It's a good title for that, Triple Helix.\n\n2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:02.240\n So playing on the double helix where it's just the biology,\n\n2:03:02.240 --> 2:03:03.920\n it's bigger than the biology.\n\n2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:05.360\n Exactly.\n\n2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:06.240\n It's a wonderful book.\n\n2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:08.280\n I've read it probably six or seven times\n\n2:03:08.280 --> 2:03:09.120\n throughout the year.\n\n2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:10.760\n He has another book too, which is,\n\n2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:14.320\n it's more, I think scientists would find it,\n\n2:03:14.320 --> 2:03:15.480\n I don't know, I've loved it.\n\n2:03:15.480 --> 2:03:18.560\n It's called Biology as Ideology.\n\n2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:20.840\n And it really is all about,\n\n2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:22.840\n I wouldn't call it one of the best books of all time,\n\n2:03:22.840 --> 2:03:26.800\n but I love the book because it really does point out,\n\n2:03:26.800 --> 2:03:31.640\n you know, that science is its currently practice.\n\n2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:33.160\n I mean, the book was written in 1991,\n\n2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:34.920\n but it actually, I think, still holds,\n\n2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:36.960\n that science is a currently practice,\n\n2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:38.880\n has a set of ontological commitments,\n\n2:03:38.880 --> 2:03:40.440\n which are somewhat problematic.\n\n2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:43.520\n So the assumptions are limiting.\n\n2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:45.400\n Yeah, in ways that you, it's, you know,\n\n2:03:45.400 --> 2:03:47.640\n it's like you're a fish in water and you don't, like,\n\n2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:49.160\n okay, so, yeah, so here's the.\n\n2:03:49.160 --> 2:03:50.000\n David Foster Wallace, that stuff.\n\n2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.680\n Yeah, but, you know, but here's a really cool thing\n\n2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:55.120\n I just learned recently.\n\n2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:57.920\n Is it okay to go off on this tangent for a minute?\n\n2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:00.560\n Yeah, yeah, let's go tangents, great.\n\n2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:02.600\n I was just gonna say that I just learned recently\n\n2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:06.120\n that we don't have water receptors on our skin.\n\n2:04:06.120 --> 2:04:07.720\n So how do you know when you're sweating?\n\n2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:10.560\n How do you know when a raindrop,\n\n2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:12.480\n when, you know, when it's gonna rain and, you know,\n\n2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:13.760\n like a raindrop hits your skin\n\n2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:16.600\n and you can feel that little drop of wetness.\n\n2:04:16.600 --> 2:04:18.480\n How is it that you feel that drop of wetness\n\n2:04:18.480 --> 2:04:22.280\n when we don't have water receptors in our skin?\n\n2:04:22.280 --> 2:04:23.320\n And I was, when I.\n\n2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:24.840\n My mind's blown already.\n\n2:04:24.840 --> 2:04:27.200\n Yeah, that was, I have my reaction too, right?\n\n2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:29.240\n I was like, of course we don't\n\n2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:31.460\n because we evolved in the water.\n\n2:04:31.460 --> 2:04:33.240\n Like, why would we need, you know, it just,\n\n2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:35.120\n it was just this like, you know, you have these moments\n\n2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.240\n where you're like, oh, of course, there's like a, yeah, so.\n\n2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:40.680\n You'll never see rain the same way again.\n\n2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:45.680\n So the answer is it's a combination of temperature\n\n2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:49.840\n and touch, but it's a complex sense\n\n2:04:49.840 --> 2:04:52.520\n that's only computed in your brain.\n\n2:04:52.520 --> 2:04:54.240\n There's no receptor for it.\n\n2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:55.320\n Anyways.\n\n2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:58.440\n Yeah, that's why like snow versus cold rain\n\n2:04:58.440 --> 2:05:00.520\n versus warm rain all feel different\n\n2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:03.600\n because you're trying to infer stuff from the temperature\n\n2:05:03.600 --> 2:05:05.840\n and the size of the droplets is fascinating.\n\n2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:07.600\n Yeah, your brain is a prediction machine.\n\n2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:11.000\n It's using lots and lots of information and combining it.\n\n2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:12.160\n You know, anyway, so.\n\n2:05:12.160 --> 2:05:17.160\n But so biology is ideology is,\n\n2:05:17.320 --> 2:05:19.000\n I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest books of all time,\n\n2:05:19.000 --> 2:05:22.560\n but it is a really useful book.\n\n2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:24.280\n There's a book by,\n\n2:05:24.280 --> 2:05:27.000\n if you're interested in psychology or the mind at all,\n\n2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:29.040\n there's a wonderful book, a little,\n\n2:05:29.040 --> 2:05:34.040\n it's a fairly small book called Naming the Mind\n\n2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:38.540\n by Kurt Danziger, who's a historian of psychology.\n\n2:05:38.540 --> 2:05:42.440\n Everybody in my lab reads both of these books.\n\n2:05:42.440 --> 2:05:43.920\n So what's the book?\n\n2:05:43.920 --> 2:05:45.520\n It's about the origin of the,\n\n2:05:45.520 --> 2:05:49.560\n where did we get the theory of mind that we have\n\n2:05:49.560 --> 2:05:53.440\n that the human mind is populated by thoughts and feelings\n\n2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:57.800\n and perceptions and where did those categories come from?\n\n2:05:57.800 --> 2:06:00.520\n Because they don't exist in all cultures.\n\n2:06:01.680 --> 2:06:05.940\n Oh, so this isn't, that's a cultural construct?\n\n2:06:05.940 --> 2:06:08.040\n The idea that you have thoughts and feelings\n\n2:06:08.040 --> 2:06:11.280\n and they're very distinct is definitely a cultural construct.\n\n2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:15.000\n That's another mind blowing thing, just like the rain.\n\n2:06:16.180 --> 2:06:18.540\n So Kurt Danziger is a,\n\n2:06:18.540 --> 2:06:22.580\n the opening chapter in that book\n\n2:06:22.580 --> 2:06:26.220\n is absolutely mind blowing.\n\n2:06:26.220 --> 2:06:29.380\n I love it, I love it.\n\n2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:30.960\n I just think it's fantastic.\n\n2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:35.480\n And I would say that there are many,\n\n2:06:35.480 --> 2:06:39.020\n many popular science books that I could recommend\n\n2:06:39.020 --> 2:06:42.500\n that I think are extremely well written in their own way.\n\n2:06:42.500 --> 2:06:44.580\n You know, before I, maybe I said this to you,\n\n2:06:44.580 --> 2:06:49.140\n but before I undertook writing How Emotions Are Made,\n\n2:06:49.140 --> 2:06:53.060\n I read, I don't know, somewhere on the order of 50 or 60\n\n2:06:54.340 --> 2:06:56.540\n popular science books to try to figure out\n\n2:06:56.540 --> 2:07:00.460\n how to write a popular science book.\n\n2:07:00.460 --> 2:07:03.980\n Because while there are many books about writing,\n\n2:07:03.980 --> 2:07:07.380\n Stephen King has a great book about writing.\n\n2:07:07.380 --> 2:07:10.660\n And, you know, where he gives tips\n\n2:07:10.660 --> 2:07:13.380\n interlaced with his own personal history.\n\n2:07:14.660 --> 2:07:17.500\n That was where I learned you write for a specific person.\n\n2:07:17.500 --> 2:07:19.320\n You have a specific person in mind.\n\n2:07:19.320 --> 2:07:22.740\n And that's, for me, that person is Dan.\n\n2:07:22.740 --> 2:07:23.580\n That's fascinating.\n\n2:07:23.580 --> 2:07:24.780\n I mean, that's a whole nother conversation\n\n2:07:24.780 --> 2:07:27.980\n to have like which popular science books,\n\n2:07:27.980 --> 2:07:31.340\n like what you learned from that search.\n\n2:07:31.340 --> 2:07:34.300\n Because there's, I have some,\n\n2:07:34.300 --> 2:07:35.700\n for me, some popular science books\n\n2:07:35.700 --> 2:07:38.180\n that like I just roll my eyes, like this is too,\n\n2:07:40.100 --> 2:07:41.780\n it's the same with TED Talks.\n\n2:07:41.780 --> 2:07:45.140\n Like some of them go too much into the flowery\n\n2:07:45.140 --> 2:07:48.860\n and don't, I would say don't give enough respect\n\n2:07:48.860 --> 2:07:50.660\n to the intelligence of the reader.\n\n2:07:51.780 --> 2:07:55.140\n And, but that's, this is my own bias very specifically.\n\n2:07:55.140 --> 2:07:56.660\n I completely agree with you.\n\n2:07:56.660 --> 2:08:01.660\n And in fact, I have a colleague, his name is Van Yang,\n\n2:08:01.660 --> 2:08:06.660\n who, you know, he produced a cinematic lecture\n\n2:08:08.060 --> 2:08:10.580\n of how emotions are made that we wrote together\n\n2:08:10.580 --> 2:08:13.860\n with Joseph Fridman, no relation.\n\n2:08:13.860 --> 2:08:14.940\n Yes.\n\n2:08:14.940 --> 2:08:16.100\n Well, we're all related.\n\n2:08:16.100 --> 2:08:17.420\n Well, I mean, you and I are probably,\n\n2:08:17.420 --> 2:08:18.620\n you know, have some, yeah.\n\n2:08:18.620 --> 2:08:20.740\n Yeah, I remember.\n\n2:08:20.740 --> 2:08:22.820\n It's the memories are in there somewhere.\n\n2:08:22.820 --> 2:08:26.140\n Yeah, it's from many, many, many generations ago.\n\n2:08:26.140 --> 2:08:28.700\n Well, half my family is Russian, so from.\n\n2:08:28.700 --> 2:08:29.540\n The good half.\n\n2:08:29.540 --> 2:08:31.780\n The good half, right.\n\n2:08:31.780 --> 2:08:36.780\n But, you know, he, his goal actually is to produce,\n\n2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:46.460\n you know, videos and lectures\n\n2:08:46.460 --> 2:08:49.820\n that are beautiful and educational\n\n2:08:49.820 --> 2:08:54.820\n and that don't dumb the material down.\n\n2:08:56.260 --> 2:08:59.260\n And he's really remarkable at it actually.\n\n2:08:59.260 --> 2:09:01.980\n I mean, just, but again, you know,\n\n2:09:01.980 --> 2:09:04.340\n that requires a bit of a paradigm shift.\n\n2:09:04.340 --> 2:09:05.460\n We could have a whole conversation\n\n2:09:05.460 --> 2:09:08.340\n about the split between entertainment\n\n2:09:08.340 --> 2:09:09.780\n and education in this country\n\n2:09:09.780 --> 2:09:11.060\n and why it is the way it is,\n\n2:09:11.060 --> 2:09:13.380\n but that's another conversation.\n\n2:09:13.380 --> 2:09:14.340\n To be continued.\n\n2:09:14.340 --> 2:09:17.300\n But I would say if I were to pick one book\n\n2:09:17.300 --> 2:09:20.420\n that I think is a really good example\n\n2:09:20.420 --> 2:09:23.640\n of good science writing, it would be The Beak of the Finch.\n\n2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:28.640\n Which won a Pulitzer Prize a number of years ago.\n\n2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:34.280\n And I'm not, I'm not remembering the author's name.\n\n2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:35.920\n I'm blanking.\n\n2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:40.680\n But the, I'm guessing, is it focusing on birds\n\n2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:42.480\n and the evolution of birds?\n\n2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:45.160\n Actually, there's also The Evolution of Beauty,\n\n2:09:45.160 --> 2:09:48.080\n which is, yeah, which is also a great book.\n\n2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:51.460\n But no, The Beak of the Finch is,\n\n2:09:51.460 --> 2:09:56.460\n it's a, it has two storylines that are interwoven.\n\n2:09:56.820 --> 2:10:01.820\n One is about Darwin and Darwin's explorations\n\n2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:04.040\n in the Galapagos Island.\n\n2:10:04.040 --> 2:10:07.800\n And then modern day researchers from Princeton\n\n2:10:07.800 --> 2:10:10.880\n who have a research program in the Galapagos\n\n2:10:10.880 --> 2:10:13.060\n looking at Darwin's finches.\n\n2:10:13.060 --> 2:10:18.060\n And it's just a really, first of all,\n\n2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:21.400\n there's top notch science in there.\n\n2:10:21.400 --> 2:10:26.040\n And really science, like evolutionary biology\n\n2:10:26.040 --> 2:10:28.480\n that a lot of people don't know.\n\n2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:30.860\n And it's told really, really well.\n\n2:10:30.860 --> 2:10:34.440\n It sounds like they're also, there's a narrative in there.\n\n2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:35.840\n It's like storytelling too.\n\n2:10:35.840 --> 2:10:38.720\n Yeah, I think all good popular science books\n\n2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.060\n are storytelling, but storytelling grounded,\n\n2:10:42.060 --> 2:10:44.680\n constrained by the evidence.\n\n2:10:44.680 --> 2:10:47.220\n And then I just wanna say that there are,\n\n2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:51.280\n for fiction, I'm a really big fan of love stories,\n\n2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:54.600\n just to return us to the topic that we began with.\n\n2:10:54.600 --> 2:10:59.600\n And so my, some of my favorite love stories\n\n2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:04.240\n are Major Pettigrew's Last Stand by Helen Simonson.\n\n2:11:05.280 --> 2:11:08.700\n It's a love story about people\n\n2:11:08.700 --> 2:11:11.260\n who you wouldn't expect to fall in love\n\n2:11:11.260 --> 2:11:12.960\n and all the people around them\n\n2:11:12.960 --> 2:11:15.720\n who have to overcome their prejudices.\n\n2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:19.520\n And I love this book.\n\n2:11:19.520 --> 2:11:22.120\n What do you like, like what makes a good love story?\n\n2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:24.560\n There isn't one thing.\n\n2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:25.640\n There are many different things\n\n2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:26.880\n that make a good love story.\n\n2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:31.880\n But I think in this case, you can feel,\n\n2:11:32.020 --> 2:11:36.160\n you can feel the journey.\n\n2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:39.080\n You can feel the journey that these characters are on\n\n2:11:39.080 --> 2:11:42.860\n and all the people around them are on this journey too,\n\n2:11:42.860 --> 2:11:47.700\n basically to come to grips with this really unexpected love,\n\n2:11:47.700 --> 2:11:50.280\n really profound love that develops\n\n2:11:50.280 --> 2:11:52.080\n between these two characters\n\n2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:55.680\n who are very unlikely to have fallen in love, but they do.\n\n2:11:55.680 --> 2:12:00.000\n And it's just, it's very gentle.\n\n2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:05.000\n Another book like that is the storied life of A.J.
