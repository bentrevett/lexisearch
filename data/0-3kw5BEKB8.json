  "transcript": "WEBVTT\n\n00:00.000 --> 00:03.640\n The following is a conversation with Whitney Cummings.\n\n00:03.640 --> 00:07.240\n She's a standup comedian, actor, producer, writer, director,\n\n00:07.240 --> 00:11.280\n and recently, finally, the host of her very own podcast\n\n00:11.280 --> 00:12.920\n called Good For You.\n\n00:12.920 --> 00:15.920\n Her most recent Netflix special called Can I Touch It?\n\n00:15.920 --> 00:19.160\n features in part a robot she affectionately named\n\n00:19.160 --> 00:23.420\n Bearclaw that is designed to be visually a replica of Whitney.\n\n00:23.420 --> 00:26.000\n It's exciting for me to see one of my favorite comedians\n\n00:26.000 --> 00:30.720\n explore the social aspects of robotics and AI in our society.\n\n00:30.720 --> 00:32.920\n She also has some fascinating ideas\n\n00:32.920 --> 00:36.000\n about human behavior, psychology, and neurology,\n\n00:36.000 --> 00:37.800\n some of which she explores in her book\n\n00:37.800 --> 00:41.240\n called I'm Fine and Other Lies.\n\n00:41.240 --> 00:43.320\n It was truly a pleasure to meet Whitney\n\n00:43.320 --> 00:45.200\n and have this conversation with her\n\n00:45.200 --> 00:47.920\n and even to continue it through text afterwards.\n\n00:47.920 --> 00:50.160\n Every once in a while, late at night,\n\n00:50.160 --> 00:52.360\n I'll be programming over a cup of coffee\n\n00:52.360 --> 00:55.760\n and will get a text from Whitney saying something hilarious\n\n00:55.760 --> 00:58.960\n or weirder yet, sending a video of Brian Callan\n\n00:58.960 --> 01:00.960\n saying something hilarious.\n\n01:00.960 --> 01:03.880\n That's when I know the universe has a sense of humor\n\n01:03.880 --> 01:07.400\n and it gifted me with one hell of an amazing journey.\n\n01:07.400 --> 01:10.320\n Then I put the phone down and go back to programming\n\n01:10.320 --> 01:13.400\n with a stupid, joyful smile on my face.\n\n01:13.400 --> 01:14.960\n If you enjoy this conversation,\n\n01:14.960 --> 01:17.200\n listen to Whitney's podcast, Good For You,\n\n01:17.200 --> 01:19.840\n and follow her on Twitter and Instagram.\n\n01:19.840 --> 01:22.640\n This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.\n\n01:22.640 --> 01:24.840\n If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,\n\n01:24.840 --> 01:26.800\n give it five stars on Apple Podcasts,\n\n01:26.800 --> 01:30.160\n support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter\n\n01:30.160 --> 01:34.040\n at Lex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.\n\n01:34.040 --> 01:35.840\n This show is presented by Cash App,\n\n01:35.840 --> 01:38.280\n the number one finance app in the App Store.\n\n01:38.280 --> 01:40.480\n They regularly support Whitney's Good For You podcast\n\n01:40.480 --> 01:41.440\n as well.\n\n01:41.440 --> 01:43.920\n I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,\n\n01:43.920 --> 01:45.680\n but you can also use it to buy, sell,\n\n01:45.680 --> 01:47.960\n and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.\n\n01:47.960 --> 01:50.680\n Cash App also has a new investing feature.\n\n01:50.680 --> 01:53.480\n You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth,\n\n01:53.480 --> 01:55.760\n no matter what the stock price is.\n\n01:55.760 --> 01:58.560\n Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,\n\n01:58.560 --> 02:02.000\n subsidiary of Square, and member SIPC.\n\n02:02.000 --> 02:04.120\n I'm excited to be working with Cash App\n\n02:04.120 --> 02:07.160\n to support one of my favorite organizations called First,\n\n02:07.160 --> 02:10.400\n best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions.\n\n02:10.400 --> 02:13.800\n They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students\n\n02:13.800 --> 02:16.000\n in over 110 countries,\n\n02:16.000 --> 02:18.680\n and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,\n\n02:18.680 --> 02:19.960\n which means the donated money\n\n02:19.960 --> 02:22.360\n is used to maximum effectiveness.\n\n02:22.360 --> 02:25.240\n When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play,\n\n02:25.240 --> 02:28.920\n and use code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,\n\n02:28.920 --> 02:32.080\n and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,\n\n02:32.080 --> 02:35.240\n which again, is an organization that I've personally seen\n\n02:35.240 --> 02:37.360\n inspire girls and boys to dream\n\n02:37.360 --> 02:39.120\n of engineering a better world.\n\n02:40.440 --> 02:43.040\n This podcast is supported by ZipRecruiter.\n\n02:43.040 --> 02:45.200\n Hiring great people is hard,\n\n02:45.200 --> 02:47.280\n and to me is the most important element\n\n02:47.280 --> 02:50.080\n of a successful mission driven team.\n\n02:50.080 --> 02:52.080\n I've been fortunate to be a part of,\n\n02:52.080 --> 02:54.680\n and to lead several great engineering teams.\n\n02:54.680 --> 02:56.640\n The hiring I've done in the past\n\n02:56.640 --> 02:59.360\n was mostly through tools that we built ourselves,\n\n02:59.360 --> 03:02.360\n but reinventing the wheel was painful.\n\n03:02.360 --> 03:05.200\n ZipRecruiter is a tool that's already available for you.\n\n03:05.200 --> 03:08.960\n It seeks to make hiring simple, fast, and smart.\n\n03:08.960 --> 03:11.920\n For example, Codable cofounder Gretchen Huebner\n\n03:11.920 --> 03:14.360\n used ZipRecruiter to find a new game artist\n\n03:14.360 --> 03:16.680\n to join her education tech company.\n\n03:16.680 --> 03:18.800\n By using ZipRecruiter screening questions\n\n03:18.800 --> 03:21.560\n to filter candidates, Gretchen found it easier\n\n03:21.560 --> 03:23.040\n to focus on the best candidates,\n\n03:23.040 --> 03:26.400\n and finally hiring the perfect person for the role\n\n03:26.400 --> 03:29.400\n in less than two weeks from start to finish.\n\n03:29.400 --> 03:32.480\n ZipRecruiter, the smartest way to hire.\n\n03:32.480 --> 03:34.120\n See why ZipRecruiter is effective\n\n03:34.120 --> 03:37.520\n for businesses of all sizes by signing up as I did\n\n03:37.520 --> 03:41.520\n for free at ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.\n\n03:41.520 --> 03:45.320\n That's ziprecruiter.com slash lexpod.\n\n03:45.320 --> 03:50.320\n And now, here's my conversation with Whitney Cummings.\n\n03:51.560 --> 03:53.720\n I have trouble making eye contact, as you can tell.\n\n03:53.720 --> 03:54.560\n Me too.\n\n03:54.560 --> 03:56.920\n Did you know that I had to work on making eye contact\n\n03:56.920 --> 03:58.840\n because I used to look here?\n\n03:58.840 --> 03:59.680\n Do you see what I'm doing?\n\n03:59.680 --> 04:00.500\n That helps, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n04:00.500 --> 04:01.760\n Do you want me to do that?\n\n04:01.760 --> 04:03.560\n Well, I'll do this way, I'll cheat the camera.\n\n04:03.560 --> 04:05.720\n But I used to do this, and finally people,\n\n04:05.720 --> 04:07.380\n like I'd be on dates and guys would be like,\n\n04:07.380 --> 04:08.220\n are you looking at my hair?\n\n04:08.220 --> 04:10.860\n Like they get, it would make people really insecure\n\n04:10.860 --> 04:13.160\n because I didn't really get a lot of eye contact as a kid.\n\n04:13.160 --> 04:14.720\n It's one to three years.\n\n04:14.720 --> 04:16.440\n Did you not get a lot of eye contact as a kid?\n\n04:16.440 --> 04:17.280\n I don't know.\n\n04:17.280 --> 04:19.560\n I haven't done the soul searching.\n\n04:19.560 --> 04:20.760\n Right.\n\n04:20.760 --> 04:24.200\n So, but there's definitely some psychological issues.\n\n04:24.200 --> 04:25.520\n Makes you uncomfortable.\n\n04:25.520 --> 04:27.880\n Yeah, for some reason when I connect eyes,\n\n04:27.880 --> 04:31.800\n I start to think, I assume that you're judging me.\n\n04:31.800 --> 04:33.320\n Oh, well, I am.\n\n04:33.320 --> 04:34.440\n That's why you assume that.\n\n04:34.440 --> 04:35.280\n Yeah.\n\n04:35.280 --> 04:36.100\n We all are.\n\n04:36.100 --> 04:36.940\n All right.\n\n04:36.940 --> 04:37.760\n This is perfect.\n\n04:37.760 --> 04:38.600\n The podcast would be me and you both\n\n04:38.600 --> 04:42.400\n staring at the table on the whole time.\n\n04:42.400 --> 04:44.200\n Do you think robots are the future?\n\n04:44.200 --> 04:45.960\n Ones with human level intelligence\n\n04:45.960 --> 04:49.480\n will be female, male, genderless,\n\n04:49.480 --> 04:53.220\n or another gender we have not yet created as a society?\n\n04:53.220 --> 04:55.220\n You're the expert at this.\n\n04:55.220 --> 04:56.060\n Well, I'm gonna ask you.\n\n04:56.060 --> 04:57.320\n You know the answer.\n\n04:57.320 --> 04:58.680\n I'm gonna ask you questions\n\n04:58.680 --> 05:00.920\n that maybe nobody knows the answer to.\n\n05:00.920 --> 05:01.960\n Okay.\n\n05:01.960 --> 05:04.080\n And then I just want you to hypothesize\n\n05:04.080 --> 05:09.080\n as a imaginative author, director, comedian.\n\n05:10.960 --> 05:12.120\n Can we just be very clear\n\n05:12.120 --> 05:14.200\n that you know a ton about this\n\n05:14.200 --> 05:15.780\n and I know nothing about this,\n\n05:15.780 --> 05:19.600\n but I have thought a lot about\n\n05:19.600 --> 05:22.840\n what I think robots can fix in our society.\n\n05:22.840 --> 05:24.400\n And I mean, I'm a comedian.\n\n05:24.400 --> 05:27.520\n It's my job to study human nature,\n\n05:27.520 --> 05:28.860\n to make jokes about human nature\n\n05:28.860 --> 05:31.080\n and to sometimes play devil's advocate.\n\n05:31.080 --> 05:35.160\n And I just see such a tremendous negativity around robots\n\n05:35.160 --> 05:38.040\n or at least the idea of robots that it was like,\n\n05:38.040 --> 05:40.660\n oh, I'm just gonna take the opposite side for fun,\n\n05:40.660 --> 05:43.400\n for jokes and then I was like,\n\n05:43.400 --> 05:45.920\n oh no, I really agree in this devil's advocate argument.\n\n05:45.920 --> 05:49.400\n So please correct me when I'm wrong about this stuff.\n\n05:49.400 --> 05:51.780\n So first of all, there's no right and wrong\n\n05:51.780 --> 05:53.840\n because we're all,\n\n05:53.840 --> 05:55.920\n I think most of the people working on robotics\n\n05:55.920 --> 05:57.580\n are really not actually even thinking\n\n05:57.580 --> 06:00.040\n about some of the big picture things\n\n06:00.040 --> 06:01.280\n that you've been exploring.\n\n06:01.280 --> 06:04.600\n In fact, your robot, what's her name by the way?\n\n06:04.600 --> 06:05.440\n Bearclaw.\n\n06:05.440 --> 06:06.280\n We'll go with Bearclaw.\n\n06:06.280 --> 06:11.280\n What's the genesis of that name by the way?\n\n06:11.720 --> 06:15.000\n Bearclaw was, I got, I don't even remember the joke\n\n06:15.000 --> 06:16.680\n cause I black out after I shoot specials,\n\n06:16.680 --> 06:19.200\n but I was writing something about like the pet names\n\n06:19.200 --> 06:22.960\n that men call women, like cupcake, sweetie, honey,\n\n06:22.960 --> 06:26.560\n you know, like we're always named after desserts\n\n06:26.560 --> 06:29.920\n or something and I was just writing a joke about,\n\n06:29.920 --> 06:31.000\n if you wanna call us a dessert,\n\n06:31.000 --> 06:33.200\n at least pick like a cool dessert, you know,\n\n06:33.200 --> 06:35.680\n like Bearclaw, like something cool.\n\n06:35.680 --> 06:38.240\n So I ended up calling her Bearclaw.\n\n06:38.240 --> 06:42.280\n So do you think the future robots\n\n06:42.280 --> 06:44.440\n of greater and greater intelligence\n\n06:44.440 --> 06:46.520\n would like to make them female, male?\n\n06:46.520 --> 06:48.560\n Would we like to assign them gender\n\n06:48.560 --> 06:50.800\n or would we like to move away from gender\n\n06:50.800 --> 06:54.000\n and say something more ambiguous?\n\n06:54.000 --> 06:56.360\n I think it depends on their purpose, you know?\n\n06:56.360 --> 06:59.920\n I feel like if it's a sex robot,\n\n06:59.920 --> 07:01.900\n people prefer certain genders, you know?\n\n07:01.900 --> 07:05.840\n And I also, you know, when I went down and explored the robot\n\n07:05.840 --> 07:07.680\n factory, I was asking about the type of people\n\n07:07.680 --> 07:09.240\n that bought sex robots.\n\n07:09.240 --> 07:12.200\n And I was very surprised at the answer\n\n07:12.200 --> 07:14.160\n because of course the stereotype\n\n07:14.160 --> 07:15.320\n was it's gonna be a bunch of perverts.\n\n07:15.320 --> 07:18.580\n It ended up being a lot of people that were handicapped,\n\n07:18.580 --> 07:20.520\n a lot of people with erectile dysfunction\n\n07:20.520 --> 07:23.880\n and a lot of people that were exploring their sexuality.\n\n07:23.880 --> 07:25.920\n A lot of people that thought they were gay,\n\n07:25.920 --> 07:28.120\n but weren't sure, but didn't wanna take the risk\n\n07:28.120 --> 07:31.660\n of trying on someone that could reject them\n\n07:31.660 --> 07:33.880\n and being embarrassed or they were closeted\n\n07:33.880 --> 07:36.320\n or in a city where maybe that's, you know,\n\n07:36.320 --> 07:37.920\n taboo and stigmatized, you know?\n\n07:37.920 --> 07:40.560\n So I think that a gendered sex robot\n\n07:40.560 --> 07:42.340\n that would serve an important purpose\n\n07:42.340 --> 07:44.160\n for someone trying to explore their sexuality.\n\n07:44.160 --> 07:45.000\n Am I into men?\n\n07:45.000 --> 07:46.160\n Let me try on this thing first.\n\n07:46.160 --> 07:47.000\n Am I into women?\n\n07:47.000 --> 07:48.220\n Let me try on this thing first.\n\n07:48.220 --> 07:51.200\n So I think gendered robots would be important for that.\n\n07:51.200 --> 07:53.760\n But I think genderless robots in terms of\n\n07:53.760 --> 07:56.520\n emotional support robots, babysitters,\n\n07:56.520 --> 07:58.720\n I'm fine for a genderless babysitter\n\n07:58.720 --> 08:00.100\n with my husband in the house.\n\n08:00.100 --> 08:02.080\n You know, there are places that I think\n\n08:02.080 --> 08:04.640\n that genderless makes a lot of sense,\n\n08:04.640 --> 08:07.560\n but obviously not in the sex area.\n\n08:07.560 --> 08:09.920\n What do you mean with your husband in the house?\n\n08:09.920 --> 08:11.800\n What does that have to do with the gender of the robot?\n\n08:11.800 --> 08:13.040\n Right, I mean, I don't have a husband,\n\n08:13.040 --> 08:14.340\n but hypothetically speaking,\n\n08:14.340 --> 08:15.720\n I think every woman's worst nightmare\n\n08:15.720 --> 08:17.240\n is like the hot babysitter.\n\n08:17.240 --> 08:19.280\n You know what I mean?\n\n08:19.280 --> 08:21.700\n So I think that there is a time and place,\n\n08:21.700 --> 08:25.360\n I think, for genderless, you know, teachers, doctors,\n\n08:25.360 --> 08:27.280\n all that kind of, it would be very awkward\n\n08:27.280 --> 08:29.700\n if the first robotic doctor was a guy\n\n08:29.700 --> 08:32.600\n or the first robotic nurse was a woman.\n\n08:32.600 --> 08:36.100\n You know, it's sort of, that stuff is still loaded.\n\n08:36.100 --> 08:38.440\n I think that genderless could just take\n\n08:38.440 --> 08:43.440\n the unnecessary drama out of it\n\n08:43.900 --> 08:46.000\n and possibility to sexualize them\n\n08:46.000 --> 08:49.520\n or be triggered by any of that stuff.\n\n08:49.520 --> 08:52.800\n So there's two components to this, to Bearclaw.\n\n08:52.800 --> 08:55.040\n So one is the voice and the talking and so on,\n\n08:55.040 --> 08:56.360\n and then there's the visual appearance.\n\n08:56.360 --> 08:59.580\n So on the topic of gender and genderless,\n\n08:59.580 --> 09:03.160\n in your experience, what has been the value\n\n09:03.160 --> 09:04.900\n of the physical appearance?\n\n09:04.900 --> 09:08.980\n So has it added much to the depth of the interaction?\n\n09:08.980 --> 09:11.200\n I mean, mine's kind of an extenuating circumstance\n\n09:11.200 --> 09:13.540\n because she is supposed to look exactly like me.\n\n09:13.540 --> 09:15.980\n I mean, I spent six months getting my face molded\n\n09:15.980 --> 09:19.440\n and having, you know, the idea was I was exploring\n\n09:19.440 --> 09:21.220\n the concept of can robots replace us?\n\n09:21.220 --> 09:22.480\n Because that's the big fear,\n\n09:22.480 --> 09:24.240\n but also the big dream in a lot of ways.\n\n09:24.240 --> 09:28.200\n And I wanted to dig into that area because, you know,\n\n09:28.200 --> 09:29.920\n for a lot of people, it's like,\n\n09:29.920 --> 09:32.080\n they're gonna take our jobs and they're gonna replace us.\n\n09:32.080 --> 09:34.360\n Legitimate fear, but then a lot of women I know are like,\n\n09:34.360 --> 09:36.960\n I would love for a robot to replace me every now and then\n\n09:36.960 --> 09:38.880\n so it can go to baby showers for me\n\n09:38.880 --> 09:40.180\n and it can pick up my kids at school\n\n09:40.180 --> 09:42.480\n and it can cook dinner and whatever.\n\n09:42.480 --> 09:45.200\n So I just think that was an interesting place to explore.\n\n09:45.200 --> 09:47.040\n So her looking like me was a big part of it.\n\n09:47.040 --> 09:49.080\n Now her looking like me just adds\n\n09:49.080 --> 09:51.360\n an unnecessary level of insecurity\n\n09:51.360 --> 09:53.520\n because I got her a year ago\n\n09:53.520 --> 09:54.680\n and she already looks younger than me.\n\n09:54.680 --> 09:57.640\n So that's a weird problem.\n\n09:57.640 --> 10:00.680\n But I think that her looking human was the idea.\n\n10:00.680 --> 10:03.080\n And I think that where we are now,\n\n10:03.080 --> 10:04.800\n please correct me if I'm wrong,\n\n10:04.800 --> 10:09.800\n a human robot resembling an actual human you know\n\n10:09.860 --> 10:13.760\n is going to feel more realistic than some generic face.\n\n10:13.760 --> 10:18.120\n Well, you're saying that robots that have some familiarity\n\n10:19.120 --> 10:22.480\n like look similar to somebody that you actually know\n\n10:22.480 --> 10:24.560\n you'll be able to form a deeper connection with?\n\n10:24.560 --> 10:26.000\n That was the question. I think so on some level, right?\n\n10:26.000 --> 10:26.960\n That's an open question.\n\n10:26.960 --> 10:30.240\n I don't, you know, it's an interesting.\n\n10:30.240 --> 10:32.080\n Or the opposite, because then you know me\n\n10:32.080 --> 10:33.360\n and you're like, well, I know this isn't real\n\n10:33.360 --> 10:34.560\n because you're right here.\n\n10:34.560 --> 10:36.280\n So maybe it does the opposite.\n\n10:36.280 --> 10:39.240\n We have a very keen eye for human faces\n\n10:39.240 --> 10:41.840\n and they're able to detect strangeness\n\n10:41.840 --> 10:44.360\n especially that one has to do with people\n\n10:44.360 --> 10:46.400\n whose faces we've seen a lot of.\n\n10:46.400 --> 10:48.880\n So I tend to be a bigger fan\n\n10:48.880 --> 10:52.840\n of moving away completely from faces.\n\n10:52.840 --> 10:54.200\n Of recognizable faces?\n\n10:54.200 --> 10:56.000\n No, just human faces at all.\n\n10:56.000 --> 10:58.280\n In general, because I think that's where things get dicey.\n\n10:58.280 --> 11:00.440\n And one thing I will say is\n\n11:00.440 --> 11:03.040\n I think my robot is more realistic than other robots\n\n11:03.040 --> 11:05.160\n not necessarily because you have seen me\n\n11:05.160 --> 11:07.600\n and then you see her and you go, oh, they're so similar\n\n11:07.600 --> 11:11.120\n but also because human faces are flawed and asymmetrical.\n\n11:11.120 --> 11:13.440\n And sometimes we forget when we're making things\n\n11:13.440 --> 11:14.400\n that are supposed to look human,\n\n11:14.400 --> 11:16.000\n we make them too symmetrical\n\n11:16.000 --> 11:17.960\n and that's what makes them stop looking human.\n\n11:17.960 --> 11:20.520\n So because they mold in my asymmetrical face,\n\n11:20.520 --> 11:22.860\n she just, even if someone didn't know who I was\n\n11:22.860 --> 11:26.560\n I think she'd look more realistic than most generic ones\n\n11:26.560 --> 11:28.880\n that didn't have some kind of flaws.\n\n11:28.880 --> 11:29.720\n Got it.\n\n11:29.720 --> 11:30.760\n Because they start looking creepy\n\n11:30.760 --> 11:33.240\n when they're too symmetrical because human beings aren't.\n\n11:33.240 --> 11:35.720\n Yeah, the flaws is what it means to be human.\n\n11:35.720 --> 11:37.720\n So visually as well.\n\n11:37.720 --> 11:39.400\n But I'm just a fan of the idea\n\n11:39.400 --> 11:43.280\n of letting humans use a little bit more imagination.\n\n11:43.280 --> 11:47.560\n So just hearing the voice is enough for us humans\n\n11:47.560 --> 11:50.280\n to then start imagining the visual appearance\n\n11:50.280 --> 11:52.020\n that goes along with that voice.\n\n11:52.020 --> 11:54.480\n And you don't necessarily need to work too hard\n\n11:54.480 --> 11:56.920\n on creating the actual visual appearance.\n\n11:56.920 --> 11:59.120\n So there's some value to that.\n\n11:59.120 --> 12:03.360\n When you step into the stare of actually building a robot\n\n12:03.360 --> 12:04.400\n that looks like Bear Claws,\n\n12:04.400 --> 12:07.680\n such a long road of facial expressions\n\n12:07.680 --> 12:12.080\n of sort of making everything smiling, winking,\n\n12:13.120 --> 12:14.900\n rolling in the eyes, all that kind of stuff.\n\n12:14.900 --> 12:16.520\n It gets really, really tricky.\n\n12:16.520 --> 12:19.160\n It gets tricky and I think I'm, again, I'm a comedian.\n\n12:19.160 --> 12:21.800\n Like I'm obsessed with what makes us human\n\n12:21.800 --> 12:25.440\n and our human nature and the nasty side of human nature\n\n12:25.440 --> 12:27.560\n tends to be where I've ended up\n\n12:27.560 --> 12:28.800\n exploring over and over again.\n\n12:28.800 --> 12:32.620\n And I was just mostly fascinated by people's reaction.\n\n12:32.620 --> 12:34.520\n So it's my job to get the biggest reaction\n\n12:34.520 --> 12:37.460\n from a group of strangers, the loudest possible reaction.\n\n12:37.460 --> 12:39.880\n And I just had this instinct\n\n12:39.880 --> 12:41.640\n just when I started building her\n\n12:41.640 --> 12:44.560\n and people going, ah, ah, and people scream.\n\n12:44.560 --> 12:46.020\n And I mean, I would bring her out on stage\n\n12:46.020 --> 12:48.080\n and people would scream.\n\n12:48.080 --> 12:51.520\n And I just, to me, that was the next level of entertainment.\n\n12:51.520 --> 12:53.520\n Getting a laugh, I've done that, I know how to do that.\n\n12:53.520 --> 12:54.940\n I think comedians were always trying to figure out\n\n12:54.940 --> 12:57.280\n what the next level is and comedy's evolving so much.\n\n12:57.280 --> 12:59.880\n And Jordan Peele had just done\n\n12:59.880 --> 13:01.760\n these genius comedy horror movies,\n\n13:01.760 --> 13:04.480\n which feel like the next level of comedy to me.\n\n13:04.480 --> 13:09.480\n And this sort of funny horror of a robot\n\n13:10.040 --> 13:11.680\n was fascinating to me.\n\n13:11.680 --> 13:15.520\n But I think the thing that I got the most obsessed with\n\n13:15.520 --> 13:18.200\n was people being freaked out and scared of her.\n\n13:18.200 --> 13:21.640\n And I started digging around with pathogen avoidance\n\n13:21.640 --> 13:24.040\n and the idea that we've essentially evolved\n\n13:24.040 --> 13:27.120\n to be repelled by anything that looks human,\n\n13:27.120 --> 13:28.880\n but is off a little bit.\n\n13:28.880 --> 13:32.100\n Anything that could be sick or diseased or dead,\n\n13:32.100 --> 13:33.940\n essentially, is our reptilian brain's way\n\n13:33.940 --> 13:38.660\n to get us to not try to have sex with it, basically.\n\n13:38.660 --> 13:41.880\n So I got really fascinated by how freaked out and scared.\n\n13:41.880 --> 13:44.360\n I mean, I would see grown men get upset.\n\n13:44.360 --> 13:45.360\n They'd get that thing away from me,\n\n13:45.360 --> 13:47.880\n look, I don't like that, like people would get angry.\n\n13:47.880 --> 13:50.840\n And it was like, you know what this is, you know?\n\n13:50.840 --> 13:55.160\n But the sort of like, you know, amygdala getting activated\n\n13:55.160 --> 13:58.560\n by something that to me is just a fun toy\n\n13:58.560 --> 14:02.080\n said a lot about our history as a species\n\n14:02.080 --> 14:04.720\n and what got us into trouble thousands of years ago.\n\n14:04.720 --> 14:07.280\n So it's that, it's the deep down stuff\n\n14:07.280 --> 14:10.080\n that's in our genetics, but also is it just,\n\n14:10.080 --> 14:13.080\n are people freaked out by the fact that there's a robot?\n\n14:13.080 --> 14:14.840\n So it's not just the appearance,\n\n14:14.840 --> 14:17.860\n but there's an artificial human.\n\n14:17.860 --> 14:21.280\n Anything people, I think, and I'm just also fascinated\n\n14:21.280 --> 14:23.040\n by the blind spots humans have.\n\n14:23.040 --> 14:24.760\n So the idea that you're afraid of that,\n\n14:24.760 --> 14:27.200\n I mean, how many robots have killed people?\n\n14:27.200 --> 14:29.800\n How many humans have died at the hands of other humans?\n\n14:29.800 --> 14:31.400\n Yeah, a few more. Millions?\n\n14:31.400 --> 14:32.880\n Hundreds of millions?\n\n14:32.880 --> 14:34.560\n Yet we're scared of that?\n\n14:34.560 --> 14:36.080\n And we'll go to the grocery store\n\n14:36.080 --> 14:37.200\n and be around a bunch of humans\n\n14:37.200 --> 14:39.520\n who statistically the chances are much higher\n\n14:39.520 --> 14:40.700\n that you're gonna get killed by humans.\n\n14:40.700 --> 14:43.600\n So I'm just fascinated by without judgment\n\n14:43.600 --> 14:47.840\n how irrational we are as a species.\n\n14:47.840 --> 14:49.280\n The word is the exponential.\n\n14:49.280 --> 14:51.400\n So it's, you know, you can say the same thing\n\n14:51.400 --> 14:54.160\n about nuclear weapons before we dropped\n\n14:54.160 --> 14:55.760\n on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n14:55.760 --> 14:59.400\n So the worry that people have is the exponential growth.\n\n14:59.400 --> 15:03.680\n So it's like, oh, it's fun and games right now,\n\n15:03.680 --> 15:06.260\n but you know, overnight,\n\n15:07.160 --> 15:10.000\n especially if a robot provides value to society,\n\n15:10.000 --> 15:11.680\n we'll put one in every home\n\n15:11.680 --> 15:13.840\n and then all of a sudden lose track\n\n15:13.840 --> 15:17.280\n of the actual large scale impact it has on society.\n\n15:17.280 --> 15:20.280\n And then all of a sudden gain greater and greater control\n\n15:20.280 --> 15:22.540\n to where we'll all be, you know,\n\n15:22.540 --> 15:23.920\n affect our political system\n\n15:23.920 --> 15:25.760\n and then affect our decision.\n\n15:25.760 --> 15:27.720\n Didn't robots already ruin our political system?\n\n15:27.720 --> 15:28.720\n Didn't that just already happen?\n\n15:28.720 --> 15:30.800\n Which ones? Oh, Russia hacking.\n\n15:30.800 --> 15:35.000\n No offense, but hasn't that already happened?\n\n15:35.000 --> 15:36.440\n I mean, that was like an algorithm\n\n15:36.440 --> 15:39.320\n of negative things being clicked on more.\n\n15:39.320 --> 15:40.760\n We'd like to tell stories\n\n15:40.760 --> 15:43.640\n and like to demonize certain people.\n\n15:43.640 --> 15:46.840\n I think nobody understands our current political system\n\n15:46.840 --> 15:49.680\n or discourse on Twitter, the Twitter mobs.\n\n15:49.680 --> 15:52.560\n Nobody has a sense, not Twitter, not Facebook,\n\n15:52.560 --> 15:53.400\n the people running it.\n\n15:53.400 --> 15:55.360\n Nobody understands the impact of these algorithms.\n\n15:55.360 --> 15:56.880\n They're trying their best.\n\n15:56.880 --> 15:57.940\n Despite what people think,\n\n15:57.940 --> 16:00.200\n they're not like a bunch of lefties\n\n16:00.200 --> 16:03.240\n trying to make sure that Hillary Clinton gets elected.\n\n16:03.240 --> 16:06.840\n It's more that it's an incredibly complex system\n\n16:06.840 --> 16:08.860\n that we don't, and that's the worry.\n\n16:08.860 --> 16:11.440\n It's so complex and moves so fast\n\n16:11.440 --> 16:15.760\n that nobody will be able to stop it once it happens.\n\n16:15.760 --> 16:16.920\n And let me ask a question.\n\n16:16.920 --> 16:19.440\n This is a very savage question.\n\n16:19.440 --> 16:23.840\n Which is, is this just the next stage of evolution?\n\n16:23.840 --> 16:26.080\n As humans, when people will die, yes.\n\n16:26.080 --> 16:28.200\n I mean, that's always happened, you know?\n\n16:28.200 --> 16:30.320\n Is this just taking emotion out of it?\n\n16:30.320 --> 16:34.960\n Is this basically the next stage of survival of the fittest?\n\n16:34.960 --> 16:37.760\n Yeah, you have to think of organisms.\n\n16:37.760 --> 16:41.360\n You know, what does it mean to be a living organism?\n\n16:41.360 --> 16:46.360\n Like, is a smartphone part of your living organism, or?\n\n16:46.760 --> 16:49.680\n We're in relationships with our phones.\n\n16:49.680 --> 16:50.520\n Yeah.\n\n16:50.520 --> 16:52.880\n We have sex through them, with them.\n\n16:52.880 --> 16:54.440\n What's the difference between with them and through them?\n\n16:54.440 --> 16:57.080\n But it also expands your cognitive abilities,\n\n16:57.080 --> 16:59.060\n expands your memory, knowledge, and so on.\n\n16:59.060 --> 17:00.640\n So you're a much smarter person\n\n17:00.640 --> 17:02.600\n because you have a smartphone in your hand.\n\n17:02.600 --> 17:04.780\n But as soon as it's out of my hand,\n\n17:04.780 --> 17:06.120\n we've got big problems,\n\n17:06.120 --> 17:08.360\n because we've become sort of so morphed with them.\n\n17:08.360 --> 17:09.960\n Well, there's a symbiotic relationship.\n\n17:09.960 --> 17:12.520\n And that's what, so Elon Musk, the neural link,\n\n17:12.520 --> 17:16.640\n is working on trying to increase the bandwidth\n\n17:16.640 --> 17:19.320\n of communication between computers and your brain.\n\n17:19.320 --> 17:22.800\n And so further and further expand our ability\n\n17:22.800 --> 17:26.300\n as human beings to sort of leverage machines.\n\n17:26.300 --> 17:28.220\n And maybe that's the future,\n\n17:28.220 --> 17:30.480\n the next evolutionary step.\n\n17:30.480 --> 17:33.920\n It could be also that, yes, we'll give birth,\n\n17:33.920 --> 17:36.520\n just like we give birth to human children right now,\n\n17:36.520 --> 17:38.960\n we'll give birth to AI and they'll replace us.\n\n17:38.960 --> 17:42.200\n I think it's a really interesting possibility.\n\n17:42.200 --> 17:44.080\n I'm gonna play devil's advocate.\n\n17:44.080 --> 17:48.320\n I just think that the fear of robots is wildly classist.\n\n17:48.320 --> 17:50.120\n Because, I mean, Facebook,\n\n17:50.120 --> 17:51.960\n like it's easy for us to say they're taking their data.\n\n17:51.960 --> 17:53.560\n Okay, well, a lot of people\n\n17:53.560 --> 17:55.720\n that get employment off of Facebook,\n\n17:55.720 --> 17:58.220\n they are able to get income off of Facebook.\n\n17:58.220 --> 17:59.800\n They don't care if you take their phone numbers\n\n17:59.800 --> 18:01.920\n and their emails and their data, as long as it's free.\n\n18:01.920 --> 18:03.900\n They don't wanna have to pay $5 a month for Facebook.\n\n18:03.900 --> 18:05.800\n Facebook is a wildly democratic thing.\n\n18:05.800 --> 18:08.240\n Forget about the election and all that kind of stuff.\n\n18:08.240 --> 18:12.480\n A lot of technology making people's lives easier,\n\n18:12.480 --> 18:17.100\n I find that most elite people are more scared\n\n18:17.100 --> 18:18.800\n than lower income people.\n\n18:18.800 --> 18:21.180\n So, and women for the most part.\n\n18:21.180 --> 18:23.940\n So the idea of something that's stronger than us\n\n18:23.940 --> 18:25.160\n and that might eventually kill us,\n\n18:25.160 --> 18:26.560\n like women are used to that.\n\n18:26.560 --> 18:29.980\n Like that's not, I see a lot of like really rich men\n\n18:29.980 --> 18:31.240\n being like, the robots are gonna kill us.\n\n18:31.240 --> 18:33.800\n We're like, what's another thing that's gonna kill us?\n\n18:33.800 --> 18:35.480\n I tend to see like, oh,\n\n18:35.480 --> 18:37.160\n something can walk me to my car at night.\n\n18:37.160 --> 18:39.880\n Like something can help me cook dinner or something.\n\n18:39.880 --> 18:43.020\n For people in underprivileged countries\n\n18:43.020 --> 18:45.360\n who can't afford eye surgery, like in a robot,\n\n18:45.360 --> 18:48.840\n can we send a robot to underprivileged places\n\n18:48.840 --> 18:50.680\n to do surgery where they can't?\n\n18:50.680 --> 18:53.560\n I work with this organization called Operation Smile\n\n18:53.560 --> 18:55.660\n where they do cleft palate surgeries.\n\n18:55.660 --> 18:56.500\n And there's a lot of places\n\n18:56.500 --> 18:59.160\n that can't do a very simple surgery\n\n18:59.160 --> 19:01.080\n because they can't afford doctors and medical care.\n\n19:01.080 --> 19:01.920\n And such.\n\n19:01.920 --> 19:04.840\n So I just see, and this can be completely naive\n\n19:04.840 --> 19:05.840\n and should be completely wrong,\n\n19:05.840 --> 19:08.780\n but I feel like a lot of people are going like,\n\n19:08.780 --> 19:09.920\n the robots are gonna destroy us.\n\n19:09.920 --> 19:11.640\n Humans, we're destroying ourselves.\n\n19:11.640 --> 19:12.840\n We're self destructing.\n\n19:12.840 --> 19:14.320\n Robots to me are the only hope\n\n19:14.320 --> 19:15.960\n to clean up all the messes that we've created.\n\n19:15.960 --> 19:18.240\n Even when we go try to clean up pollution in the ocean,\n\n19:18.240 --> 19:21.720\n we make it worse because of the oil that the tankers use.\n\n19:21.720 --> 19:25.400\n Like, it's like, to me, robots are the only solution.\n\n19:25.400 --> 19:27.880\n Firefighters are heroes, but they're limited\n\n19:27.880 --> 19:30.180\n in how many times they can run into a fire.\n\n19:30.180 --> 19:32.360\n So there's just something interesting to me.\n\n19:32.360 --> 19:34.360\n I'm not hearing a lot of like,\n\n19:34.360 --> 19:38.080\n lower income, more vulnerable populations\n\n19:38.080 --> 19:39.920\n talking about robots.\n\n19:39.920 --> 19:42.000\n Maybe you can speak to it a little bit more.\n\n19:42.000 --> 19:44.100\n There's an idea, I think you've expressed it.\n\n19:44.100 --> 19:48.240\n I've heard, actually a few female writers\n\n19:48.240 --> 19:51.480\n and roboticists have talked to express this idea\n\n19:51.480 --> 19:55.760\n that exactly you just said, which is,\n\n19:55.760 --> 20:00.760\n it just seems that being afraid of existential threats\n\n20:01.680 --> 20:06.240\n of artificial intelligence is a male issue.\n\n20:06.240 --> 20:07.280\n Yeah.\n\n20:07.280 --> 20:09.720\n And I wonder what that is.\n\n20:09.720 --> 20:13.680\n If it, because men have, in certain positions,\n\n20:13.680 --> 20:15.640\n like you said, it's also a classist issue.\n\n20:15.640 --> 20:17.400\n They haven't been humbled by life,\n\n20:17.400 --> 20:20.680\n and so you always look for the biggest problems\n\n20:20.680 --> 20:22.380\n to take on around you.\n\n20:22.380 --> 20:24.200\n It's a champagne problem to be afraid of robots.\n\n20:24.200 --> 20:26.440\n Most people don't have health insurance.\n\n20:26.440 --> 20:27.520\n They're afraid they're not gonna be able\n\n20:27.520 --> 20:28.360\n to feed their kids.\n\n20:28.360 --> 20:30.000\n They can't afford a tutor for their kids.\n\n20:30.000 --> 20:32.400\n I mean, I just think of the way I grew up,\n\n20:32.400 --> 20:36.160\n and I had a mother who worked two jobs, had kids.\n\n20:36.160 --> 20:38.600\n We couldn't afford an SAT tutor.\n\n20:38.600 --> 20:40.040\n The idea of a robot coming in,\n\n20:40.040 --> 20:41.080\n being able to tutor your kids,\n\n20:41.080 --> 20:43.540\n being able to provide childcare for your kids,\n\n20:43.540 --> 20:45.540\n being able to come in with cameras for eyes\n\n20:45.540 --> 20:48.320\n and make sure surveillance.\n\n20:48.320 --> 20:52.280\n I'm very pro surveillance because I've had security problems\n\n20:52.280 --> 20:55.760\n and I've been, we're generally in a little more danger\n\n20:55.760 --> 20:56.600\n than you guys are.\n\n20:56.600 --> 20:58.640\n So I think that robots are a little less scary to us\n\n20:58.640 --> 21:01.240\n because we can see them maybe as like free assistance,\n\n21:01.240 --> 21:03.440\n help and protection.\n\n21:03.440 --> 21:06.840\n And then there's sort of another element for me personally,\n\n21:06.840 --> 21:08.800\n which is maybe more of a female problem.\n\n21:08.800 --> 21:09.640\n I don't know.\n\n21:09.640 --> 21:13.040\n I'm just gonna make a generalization, happy to be wrong.\n\n21:13.040 --> 21:18.040\n But the emotional sort of component of robots\n\n21:18.040 --> 21:22.760\n and what they can provide in terms of, you know,\n\n21:22.760 --> 21:25.640\n I think there's a lot of people that don't have microphones\n\n21:25.640 --> 21:28.580\n that I just recently kind of stumbled upon\n\n21:28.580 --> 21:30.920\n in doing all my research on the sex robots\n\n21:30.920 --> 21:32.400\n for my standup special, which just,\n\n21:32.400 --> 21:35.840\n there's a lot of very shy people that aren't good at dating.\n\n21:35.840 --> 21:37.880\n There's a lot of people who are scared of human beings\n\n21:37.880 --> 21:40.500\n who have personality disorders\n\n21:40.500 --> 21:43.080\n or grow up in alcoholic homes or struggle with addiction\n\n21:43.080 --> 21:45.720\n or whatever it is where a robot can solve\n\n21:45.720 --> 21:46.920\n an emotional problem.\n\n21:46.920 --> 21:49.800\n And so we're largely having this conversation\n\n21:49.800 --> 21:53.600\n about like rich guys that are emotionally healthy\n\n21:53.600 --> 21:55.560\n and how scared of robots they are.\n\n21:55.560 --> 21:58.560\n We're forgetting about like a huge part of the population\n\n21:58.560 --> 22:01.600\n who maybe isn't as charming and effervescent\n\n22:01.600 --> 22:05.400\n and solvent as, you know, people like you and Elon Musk\n\n22:05.400 --> 22:09.240\n who these robots could solve very real problems\n\n22:09.240 --> 22:11.260\n in their life, emotional or financial.\n\n22:11.260 --> 22:13.480\n Well, that's a, in general, a really interesting idea\n\n22:13.480 --> 22:16.700\n that most people in the world don't have a voice.\n\n22:16.700 --> 22:18.200\n It's a, you've talked about it,\n\n22:18.200 --> 22:19.960\n sort of even the people on Twitter\n\n22:19.960 --> 22:22.800\n who are driving the conversation.\n\n22:22.800 --> 22:25.400\n You said comments, people who leave comments\n\n22:25.400 --> 22:28.240\n represent a very tiny percent of the population\n\n22:28.240 --> 22:30.700\n and they're the ones they, you know,\n\n22:30.700 --> 22:33.280\n we tend to think they speak for the population,\n\n22:33.280 --> 22:37.280\n but it's very possible on many topics they don't at all.\n\n22:37.280 --> 22:39.240\n And look, I, and I'm sure there's gotta be\n\n22:39.240 --> 22:43.940\n some kind of legal, you know, sort of structure in place\n\n22:43.940 --> 22:45.280\n for when the robots happen.\n\n22:45.280 --> 22:46.640\n You know way more about this than I do,\n\n22:46.640 --> 22:49.760\n but you know, for me to just go, the robots are bad,\n\n22:49.760 --> 22:51.680\n that's a wild generalization that I feel like\n\n22:51.680 --> 22:54.080\n is really inhumane in some way.\n\n22:54.080 --> 22:56.520\n You know, just after the research I've done,\n\n22:56.520 --> 22:59.280\n like you're gonna tell me that a man whose wife died\n\n22:59.280 --> 23:02.960\n suddenly and he feels guilty moving on with a human woman\n\n23:02.960 --> 23:04.280\n or can't get over the grief,\n\n23:04.280 --> 23:06.940\n he can't have a sex robot in his own house?\n\n23:06.940 --> 23:07.840\n Why not?\n\n23:07.840 --> 23:08.820\n Who cares?\n\n23:08.820 --> 23:09.980\n Why do you care?\n\n23:09.980 --> 23:12.720\n Well, there's a interesting aspect of human nature.\n\n23:12.720 --> 23:16.820\n So, you know, we tend to as a civilization\n\n23:16.820 --> 23:19.920\n to create a group that's the other in all kinds of ways.\n\n23:19.920 --> 23:20.760\n Right.\n\n23:20.760 --> 23:23.520\n And so you work with animals too,\n\n23:23.520 --> 23:26.760\n you're especially sensitive to the suffering of animals.\n\n23:26.760 --> 23:28.520\n Let me kind of ask, what's your,\n\n23:29.400 --> 23:33.920\n do you think we'll abuse robots in the future?\n\n23:33.920 --> 23:35.920\n Do you think some of the darker aspects\n\n23:35.920 --> 23:37.960\n of human nature will come out?\n\n23:37.960 --> 23:39.200\n I think some people will,\n\n23:39.200 --> 23:43.000\n but if we design them properly, the people that do it,\n\n23:43.000 --> 23:46.920\n we can put it on a record and we can put them in jail.\n\n23:46.920 --> 23:49.520\n We can find sociopaths more easily, you know, like.\n\n23:49.520 --> 23:53.200\n But why is that a sociopathic thing to harm a robot?\n\n23:53.200 --> 23:56.240\n I think, look, I don't know enough about the consciousness\n\n23:56.240 --> 23:57.920\n and stuff as you do.\n\n23:57.920 --> 23:59.840\n I guess it would have to be when they're conscious,\n\n23:59.840 --> 24:02.840\n but it is, you know, the part of the brain\n\n24:02.840 --> 24:04.400\n that is responsible for compassion,\n\n24:04.400 --> 24:05.240\n the frontal lobe or whatever,\n\n24:05.240 --> 24:08.160\n like people that abuse animals also abuse humans\n\n24:08.160 --> 24:09.440\n and commit other kinds of crimes.\n\n24:09.440 --> 24:11.080\n Like that's, it's all the same part of the brain.\n\n24:11.080 --> 24:13.440\n No one abuses animals and then it's like,\n\n24:13.440 --> 24:15.520\n awesome to women and children\n\n24:15.520 --> 24:18.600\n and awesome to underprivileged, you know, minorities.\n\n24:18.600 --> 24:20.480\n Like it's all, so, you know,\n\n24:20.480 --> 24:23.000\n we've been working really hard to put a database together\n\n24:23.000 --> 24:24.720\n of all the people that have abused animals.\n\n24:24.720 --> 24:27.320\n So when they commit another crime, you go, okay, this is,\n\n24:27.320 --> 24:29.320\n you know, it's all the same stuff.\n\n24:29.320 --> 24:32.360\n And I think people probably think I'm nuts\n\n24:32.360 --> 24:34.760\n for a lot of the animal work I do,\n\n24:34.760 --> 24:37.040\n but because when animal abuse is present,\n\n24:37.040 --> 24:38.880\n another crime is always present,\n\n24:38.880 --> 24:40.880\n but the animal abuse is the most socially acceptable.\n\n24:40.880 --> 24:43.920\n You can kick a dog and there's nothing people can do,\n\n24:43.920 --> 24:46.560\n but then what they're doing behind closed doors,\n\n24:46.560 --> 24:47.400\n you can't see.\n\n24:47.400 --> 24:48.880\n So there's always something else going on,\n\n24:48.880 --> 24:50.680\n which is why I never feel compunction about it.\n\n24:50.680 --> 24:54.360\n But I do think we'll start seeing the same thing with robots.\n\n24:54.360 --> 24:55.520\n The person that kicks the,\n\n24:55.520 --> 24:59.720\n I felt compassion when the kicking the dog robot\n\n24:59.720 --> 25:00.760\n really pissed me off.\n\n25:00.760 --> 25:04.080\n I know that they're just trying to get the stability right\n\n25:04.080 --> 25:05.200\n and all that.\n\n25:05.200 --> 25:07.320\n But I do think there will come a time\n\n25:07.320 --> 25:10.680\n where that will be a great way to be able to figure out\n\n25:10.680 --> 25:15.480\n if somebody has like, you know, antisocial behaviors.\n\n25:15.480 --> 25:18.040\n You kind of mentioned surveillance.\n\n25:18.040 --> 25:20.000\n It's also a really interesting idea of yours\n\n25:20.000 --> 25:21.520\n that you just said, you know,\n\n25:21.520 --> 25:23.400\n a lot of people seem to be really uncomfortable\n\n25:23.400 --> 25:24.240\n with surveillance.\n\n25:24.240 --> 25:25.160\n Yeah.\n\n25:25.160 --> 25:27.200\n And you just said that, you know what,\n\n25:27.200 --> 25:31.160\n for me, you know, there's positives for surveillance.\n\n25:31.160 --> 25:32.160\n I think people behave better\n\n25:32.160 --> 25:33.280\n when they know they're being watched.\n\n25:33.280 --> 25:36.000\n And I know this is a very unpopular opinion.\n\n25:36.000 --> 25:38.080\n I'm talking about it on stage right now.\n\n25:38.080 --> 25:40.320\n We behave better when we know we're being watched.\n\n25:40.320 --> 25:41.920\n You and I had a very different conversation\n\n25:41.920 --> 25:43.160\n before we were recording.\n\n25:43.160 --> 25:46.040\n If we behave different, you sit up\n\n25:46.040 --> 25:47.520\n and you are in your best behavior.\n\n25:47.520 --> 25:49.320\n And I'm trying to sound eloquent\n\n25:49.320 --> 25:51.120\n and I'm trying to not hurt anyone's feelings.\n\n25:51.120 --> 25:52.840\n And I mean, I have a camera right there.\n\n25:52.840 --> 25:54.640\n I'm behaving totally different\n\n25:54.640 --> 25:56.200\n than when we first started talking.\n\n25:56.200 --> 25:58.520\n You know, when you know there's a camera,\n\n25:58.520 --> 25:59.360\n you behave differently.\n\n25:59.360 --> 26:02.680\n I mean, there's cameras all over LA at stoplights\n\n26:02.680 --> 26:04.000\n so that people don't run stoplights,\n\n26:04.000 --> 26:05.800\n but there's not even film in it.\n\n26:05.800 --> 26:07.960\n They don't even use them anymore, but it works.\n\n26:07.960 --> 26:08.800\n It works.\n\n26:08.800 --> 26:09.640\n Right?\n\n26:09.640 --> 26:10.680\n And I'm, you know, working on this thing\n\n26:10.680 --> 26:11.920\n in stand about surveillance.\n\n26:11.920 --> 26:14.200\n It's like, that's why we embed in Santa Claus.\n\n26:14.200 --> 26:15.520\n You know, it's the Santa Claus\n\n26:15.520 --> 26:17.760\n is the first surveillance basically.\n\n26:17.760 --> 26:20.360\n All we had to say to kids is he's making a list\n\n26:20.360 --> 26:22.880\n and he's watching you and they behave better.\n\n26:22.880 --> 26:23.720\n That's brilliant.\n\n26:23.720 --> 26:26.080\n You know, so I do think that there are benefits\n\n26:26.080 --> 26:27.360\n to surveillance.\n\n26:27.360 --> 26:30.880\n You know, I think we all do sketchy things in private\n\n26:30.880 --> 26:33.240\n and we all have watched weird porn\n\n26:33.240 --> 26:34.400\n or Googled weird things.\n\n26:34.400 --> 26:37.000\n And we don't want people to know about it,\n\n26:37.000 --> 26:37.880\n our secret lives.\n\n26:37.880 --> 26:40.160\n So I do think that obviously there's,\n\n26:40.160 --> 26:42.800\n we should be able to have a modicum of privacy,\n\n26:42.800 --> 26:44.600\n but I tend to think that people\n\n26:44.600 --> 26:47.480\n that are the most negative about surveillance\n\n26:47.480 --> 26:48.320\n have the most secrets.\n\n26:48.320 --> 26:49.160\n The most to hide.\n\n26:49.160 --> 26:50.480\n Yeah.\n\n26:50.480 --> 26:51.320\n Well, you should,\n\n26:52.280 --> 26:54.480\n you're saying you're doing bits on it now?\n\n26:54.480 --> 26:56.640\n Well, I'm just talking in general about,\n\n26:56.640 --> 26:58.360\n you know, privacy and surveillance\n\n26:58.360 --> 27:00.240\n and how paranoid we're kind of becoming\n\n27:00.240 --> 27:03.600\n and how, you know, I mean, it's just wild to me\n\n27:03.600 --> 27:05.880\n that people are like, our emails are gonna leak\n\n27:05.880 --> 27:07.160\n and they're taking our phone numbers.\n\n27:07.160 --> 27:11.440\n Like there used to be a book full of phone numbers\n\n27:11.440 --> 27:15.520\n and addresses that were, they just throw it at your door.\n\n27:15.520 --> 27:18.040\n And we all had a book of everyone's numbers.\n\n27:18.040 --> 27:20.320\n You know, this is a very new thing.\n\n27:20.320 --> 27:22.360\n And, you know, I know our amygdala is designed\n\n27:22.360 --> 27:24.680\n to compound sort of threats\n\n27:24.680 --> 27:27.360\n and, you know, there's stories about,\n\n27:27.360 --> 27:30.720\n and I think we all just glom on in a very, you know,\n\n27:30.720 --> 27:32.440\n tribal way of like, yeah, they're taking our data.\n\n27:32.440 --> 27:33.720\n Like, we don't even know what that means,\n\n27:33.720 --> 27:37.080\n but we're like, well, yeah, they, they, you know?\n\n27:38.080 --> 27:40.200\n So I just think that someone's like, okay, well, so what?\n\n27:40.200 --> 27:41.320\n They're gonna sell your data?\n\n27:41.320 --> 27:42.160\n Who cares?\n\n27:42.160 --> 27:43.200\n Why do you care?\n\n27:43.200 --> 27:46.240\n First of all, that bit will kill in China.\n\n27:47.320 --> 27:51.080\n So, and I say that sort of only a little bit joking\n\n27:51.080 --> 27:55.200\n because a lot of people in China, including the citizens,\n\n27:55.200 --> 27:58.680\n despite what people in the West think of as abuse,\n\n27:59.640 --> 28:03.360\n are actually in support of the idea of surveillance.\n\n28:03.360 --> 28:06.480\n Sort of, they're not in support of the abuse of surveillance,\n\n28:06.480 --> 28:08.160\n but they're, they like, I mean,\n\n28:08.160 --> 28:10.280\n the idea of surveillance is kind of like\n\n28:11.360 --> 28:14.160\n the idea of government, like you said,\n\n28:14.160 --> 28:15.920\n we behave differently.\n\n28:15.920 --> 28:18.520\n And in a way, it's almost like why we like sports.\n\n28:18.520 --> 28:19.960\n There's rules.\n\n28:19.960 --> 28:22.400\n And within the constraints of the rules,\n\n28:22.400 --> 28:25.040\n this is a more stable society.\n\n28:25.040 --> 28:28.120\n And they make good arguments about success,\n\n28:28.120 --> 28:30.440\n being able to build successful companies,\n\n28:30.440 --> 28:32.800\n being able to build successful social lives\n\n28:32.800 --> 28:34.560\n around a fabric that's more stable.\n\n28:34.560 --> 28:37.040\n When you have a surveillance, it keeps the criminals away,\n\n28:37.040 --> 28:41.880\n keeps abusive animals, whatever the values of the society,\n\n28:41.880 --> 28:44.800\n with surveillance, you can enforce those values better.\n\n28:44.800 --> 28:45.920\n And here's what I will say.\n\n28:45.920 --> 28:47.720\n There's a lot of unethical things happening\n\n28:47.720 --> 28:48.560\n with surveillance.\n\n28:48.560 --> 28:52.080\n Like I feel the need to really make that very clear.\n\n28:52.080 --> 28:54.080\n I mean, the fact that Google is like collecting\n\n28:54.080 --> 28:55.960\n if people's hands start moving on the mouse\n\n28:55.960 --> 28:58.440\n to find out if they're getting Parkinson's\n\n28:58.440 --> 29:00.080\n and then their insurance goes up,\n\n29:00.080 --> 29:02.200\n like that is completely unethical and wrong.\n\n29:02.200 --> 29:03.360\n And I think stuff like that,\n\n29:03.360 --> 29:05.880\n we have to really be careful around.\n\n29:05.880 --> 29:08.640\n So the idea of using our data to raise our insurance rates\n\n29:08.640 --> 29:10.800\n or, you know, I heard that they're looking,\n\n29:10.800 --> 29:13.320\n they can sort of predict if you're gonna have depression\n\n29:13.320 --> 29:16.080\n based on your selfies by detecting micro muscles\n\n29:16.080 --> 29:18.240\n in your face, you know, all that kind of stuff,\n\n29:18.240 --> 29:20.040\n that is a nightmare, not okay.\n\n29:20.040 --> 29:22.360\n But I think, you know, we have to delineate\n\n29:22.360 --> 29:25.160\n what's a real threat and what's getting spam\n\n29:25.160 --> 29:26.000\n in your email box.\n\n29:26.000 --> 29:28.600\n That's not what to spend your time and energy on.\n\n29:28.600 --> 29:31.080\n Focus on the fact that every time you buy cigarettes,\n\n29:31.080 --> 29:35.240\n your insurance is going up without you knowing about it.\n\n29:35.240 --> 29:36.920\n On the topic of animals too,\n\n29:36.920 --> 29:38.360\n can we just linger on a little bit?\n\n29:38.360 --> 29:40.320\n Like, what do you think,\n\n29:41.320 --> 29:43.360\n what does this say about our society\n\n29:43.360 --> 29:46.000\n of the society wide abuse of animals\n\n29:46.000 --> 29:48.640\n that we see in general, sort of factory farming,\n\n29:48.640 --> 29:50.640\n just in general, just the way we treat animals\n\n29:50.640 --> 29:55.640\n of different categories, like what do you think of that?\n\n29:57.440 --> 29:59.680\n What does a better world look like?\n\n29:59.680 --> 30:03.640\n What should people think about it in general?\n\n30:03.640 --> 30:06.480\n I think the most interesting thing\n\n30:06.480 --> 30:09.520\n I can probably say around this that's the least emotional,\n\n30:09.520 --> 30:11.880\n cause I'm actually a very non emotional animal person\n\n30:11.880 --> 30:14.080\n because it's, I think everyone's an animal person.\n\n30:14.080 --> 30:15.880\n It's just a matter of if it's yours\n\n30:15.880 --> 30:19.600\n or if you've been conditioned to go numb, you know.\n\n30:19.600 --> 30:22.280\n I think it's really a testament to what as a species\n\n30:22.280 --> 30:24.560\n we are able to be in denial about,\n\n30:24.560 --> 30:26.280\n mass denial and mass delusion,\n\n30:26.280 --> 30:30.640\n and how we're able to dehumanize and debase groups,\n\n30:31.640 --> 30:33.400\n you know, World War II,\n\n30:34.320 --> 30:36.800\n in a way in order to conform\n\n30:36.800 --> 30:38.880\n and find protection in the conforming.\n\n30:38.880 --> 30:43.840\n So we are also a species who used to go to coliseums\n\n30:43.840 --> 30:47.520\n and watch elephants and tigers fight to the death.\n\n30:47.520 --> 30:50.280\n We used to watch human beings be pulled apart\n\n30:50.280 --> 30:53.080\n and that wasn't that long ago.\n\n30:53.080 --> 30:56.880\n We're also a species who had slaves\n\n30:56.880 --> 30:59.040\n and it was socially acceptable by a lot of people.\n\n30:59.040 --> 31:00.160\n People didn't see anything wrong with it.\n\n31:00.160 --> 31:02.680\n So we're a species that is able to go numb\n\n31:02.680 --> 31:05.960\n and that is able to dehumanize very quickly\n\n31:05.960 --> 31:08.120\n and make it the norm.\n\n31:08.120 --> 31:10.800\n Child labor wasn't that long ago.\n\n31:10.800 --> 31:12.720\n The idea that now we look back and go,\n\n31:12.720 --> 31:17.200\n oh yeah, kids were losing fingers in factories making shoes.\n\n31:17.200 --> 31:20.160\n Like someone had to come in and make that, you know.\n\n31:20.160 --> 31:23.200\n So I think it just says a lot about the fact that,\n\n31:23.200 --> 31:25.320\n you know, we are animals and we are self serving\n\n31:25.320 --> 31:27.280\n and one of the most successful,\n\n31:27.280 --> 31:29.200\n the most successful species\n\n31:29.200 --> 31:33.160\n because we are able to debase and degrade\n\n31:33.160 --> 31:36.840\n and essentially exploit anything that benefits us.\n\n31:36.840 --> 31:39.880\n I think the pendulum is gonna swing as being late.\n\n31:39.880 --> 31:40.720\n Which way?\n\n31:40.720 --> 31:42.800\n Like, I think we're Rome now, kind of.\n\n31:42.800 --> 31:44.960\n I think we're on the verge of collapse\n\n31:44.960 --> 31:47.240\n because we are dopamine receptors.\n\n31:47.240 --> 31:49.560\n Like we are just, I think we're all kind of addicts\n\n31:49.560 --> 31:50.520\n when it comes to this stuff.\n\n31:50.520 --> 31:53.360\n Like we don't know when to stop.\n\n31:53.360 --> 31:54.480\n It's always the buffet.\n\n31:54.480 --> 31:56.600\n Like we're, the thing that used to keep us alive,\n\n31:56.600 --> 31:58.360\n which is killing animals and eating them,\n\n31:58.360 --> 31:59.720\n now killing animals and eating them\n\n31:59.720 --> 32:01.200\n is what's killing us in a way.\n\n32:01.200 --> 32:02.840\n So it's like, we just can't,\n\n32:02.840 --> 32:04.920\n we don't know when to call it and we don't,\n\n32:04.920 --> 32:06.560\n moderation is not really something\n\n32:06.560 --> 32:10.040\n that humans have evolved to have yet.\n\n32:10.040 --> 32:13.640\n So I think it's really just a flaw in our wiring.\n\n32:13.640 --> 32:15.280\n Do you think we'll look back at this time\n\n32:15.280 --> 32:19.440\n as our society is being deeply unethical?\n\n32:19.440 --> 32:22.280\n Yeah, yeah, I think we'll be embarrassed.\n\n32:22.280 --> 32:24.880\n Which are the worst parts right now going on?\n\n32:24.880 --> 32:26.160\n Is it? In terms of animal?\n\n32:26.160 --> 32:27.800\n Well, I think. No, in terms of anything.\n\n32:27.800 --> 32:29.160\n What's the unethical thing?\n\n32:29.160 --> 32:32.040\n If we, and it's very hard just to take a step out of it,\n\n32:32.040 --> 32:36.240\n but you just said we used to watch, you know,\n\n32:37.360 --> 32:40.440\n there's been a lot of cruelty throughout history.\n\n32:40.440 --> 32:42.160\n What's the cruelty going on now?\n\n32:42.160 --> 32:44.200\n I think it's gonna be pigs.\n\n32:44.200 --> 32:45.520\n I think it's gonna be, I mean,\n\n32:45.520 --> 32:48.680\n pigs are one of the most emotionally intelligent animals\n\n32:48.680 --> 32:51.680\n and they have the intelligence of like a three year old.\n\n32:51.680 --> 32:54.320\n And I think we'll look back and be really,\n\n32:54.320 --> 32:55.160\n they use tools.\n\n32:55.160 --> 32:58.440\n I mean, I think we have this narrative\n\n32:58.440 --> 32:59.760\n that they're pigs and they're pigs\n\n32:59.760 --> 33:01.880\n and they're disgusting and they're dirty\n\n33:01.880 --> 33:02.880\n and they're bacon is so good.\n\n33:02.880 --> 33:04.240\n I think that we'll look back one day\n\n33:04.240 --> 33:06.640\n and be really embarrassed about that.\n\n33:06.640 --> 33:09.280\n Is this for just the, what's it called?\n\n33:09.280 --> 33:10.360\n The factory farming?\n\n33:10.360 --> 33:11.680\n So basically mass.\n\n33:11.680 --> 33:12.520\n Because we don't see it.\n\n33:12.520 --> 33:14.520\n If you saw, I mean, we do have,\n\n33:14.520 --> 33:17.600\n I mean, this is probably an evolutionary advantage.\n\n33:17.600 --> 33:20.400\n We do have the ability to completely\n\n33:20.400 --> 33:21.520\n pretend something's not,\n\n33:21.520 --> 33:24.040\n something that is so horrific that it overwhelms us\n\n33:24.040 --> 33:27.560\n and we're able to essentially deny that it's happening.\n\n33:27.560 --> 33:29.280\n I think if people were to see what goes on\n\n33:29.280 --> 33:30.480\n in factory farming,\n\n33:30.480 --> 33:35.360\n and also we're really to take in how bad it is for us,\n\n33:35.360 --> 33:37.160\n you know, we're hurting ourselves first and foremost\n\n33:37.160 --> 33:38.440\n with what we eat,\n\n33:38.440 --> 33:41.280\n but that's also a very elitist argument, you know?\n\n33:41.280 --> 33:44.600\n It's a luxury to be able to complain about meat.\n\n33:44.600 --> 33:47.160\n It's a luxury to be able to not eat meat, you know?\n\n33:47.160 --> 33:49.960\n There's very few people because of, you know,\n\n33:49.960 --> 33:53.360\n how the corporations have set up meat being cheap.\n\n33:53.360 --> 33:55.320\n You know, it's $2 to buy a Big Mac,\n\n33:55.320 --> 33:57.640\n it's $10 to buy a healthy meal.\n\n33:57.640 --> 34:00.000\n You know, that's, I think a lot of people\n\n34:00.000 --> 34:02.280\n don't have the luxury to even think that way.\n\n34:02.280 --> 34:04.240\n But I do think that animals in captivity,\n\n34:04.240 --> 34:05.080\n I think we're gonna look back\n\n34:05.080 --> 34:07.880\n and be pretty grossed out about mammals in captivity,\n\n34:07.880 --> 34:08.800\n whales, dolphins.\n\n34:08.800 --> 34:12.240\n I mean, that's already starting to dismantle, circuses,\n\n34:12.240 --> 34:14.020\n we're gonna be pretty embarrassed about.\n\n34:14.020 --> 34:17.160\n But I think it's really more a testament to,\n\n34:17.160 --> 34:22.080\n you know, there's just such a ability to go like,\n\n34:22.080 --> 34:25.560\n that thing is different than me and we're better.\n\n34:25.560 --> 34:26.800\n It's the ego, I mean, it's just,\n\n34:26.800 --> 34:29.200\n we have the species with the biggest ego ultimately.\n\n34:29.200 --> 34:30.720\n Well, that's what I think,\n\n34:30.720 --> 34:32.520\n that's my hope for robots is they'll,\n\n34:32.520 --> 34:34.240\n you mentioned consciousness before,\n\n34:34.240 --> 34:37.640\n nobody knows what consciousness is,\n\n34:37.640 --> 34:42.200\n but I'm hoping robots will help us empathize\n\n34:42.200 --> 34:47.200\n and understand that there's other creatures\n\n34:47.840 --> 34:50.320\n besides ourselves that can suffer,\n\n34:50.320 --> 34:54.800\n that can experience the world\n\n34:54.800 --> 34:57.680\n and that we can torture by our actions.\n\n34:57.680 --> 34:59.880\n And robots can explicitly teach us that,\n\n34:59.880 --> 35:01.480\n I think better than animals can.\n\n35:01.480 --> 35:06.480\n I have never seen such compassion\n\n35:06.480 --> 35:09.240\n from a lot of people in my life\n\n35:10.840 --> 35:13.640\n toward any human, animal, child,\n\n35:13.640 --> 35:15.000\n as I have a lot of people\n\n35:15.000 --> 35:16.600\n in the way they interact with the robot.\n\n35:16.600 --> 35:19.760\n Because I think there's something of,\n\n35:19.760 --> 35:23.520\n I mean, I was on the robot owner's chat boards\n\n35:23.520 --> 35:25.920\n for a good eight months.\n\n35:25.920 --> 35:28.120\n And the main emotional benefit is\n\n35:28.120 --> 35:30.360\n she's never gonna cheat on you,\n\n35:30.360 --> 35:31.920\n she's never gonna hurt you,\n\n35:31.920 --> 35:33.120\n she's never gonna lie to you,\n\n35:33.120 --> 35:34.760\n she doesn't judge you.\n\n35:34.760 --> 35:38.480\n I think that robots help people,\n\n35:38.480 --> 35:40.640\n and this is part of the work I do with animals,\n\n35:40.640 --> 35:42.760\n like I do equine therapy and train dogs and stuff,\n\n35:42.760 --> 35:46.280\n because there is this safe space to be authentic.\n\n35:46.280 --> 35:47.960\n With this being that doesn't care\n\n35:47.960 --> 35:48.800\n what you do for a living,\n\n35:48.800 --> 35:50.160\n doesn't care how much money you have,\n\n35:50.160 --> 35:51.280\n doesn't care who you're dating,\n\n35:51.280 --> 35:52.200\n doesn't care what you look like,\n\n35:52.200 --> 35:54.320\n doesn't care if you have cellulite, whatever,\n\n35:54.320 --> 35:57.720\n you feel safe to be able to truly be present\n\n35:57.720 --> 35:59.920\n without being defensive and worrying about eye contact\n\n35:59.920 --> 36:02.680\n and being triggered by needing to be perfect\n\n36:02.680 --> 36:04.840\n and fear of judgment and all that.\n\n36:04.840 --> 36:07.320\n And robots really can't judge you yet,\n\n36:08.240 --> 36:09.320\n but they can't judge you,\n\n36:09.320 --> 36:13.480\n and I think it really puts people at ease\n\n36:13.480 --> 36:15.320\n and at their most authentic.\n\n36:16.360 --> 36:18.720\n Do you think you can have a deep connection\n\n36:18.720 --> 36:21.920\n with a robot that's not judging,\n\n36:21.920 --> 36:25.440\n or do you think you can really have a relationship\n\n36:25.440 --> 36:30.000\n with a robot or a human being that's a safe space?\n\n36:30.000 --> 36:33.480\n Or is attention, mystery, danger\n\n36:33.480 --> 36:35.960\n necessary for a deep connection?\n\n36:35.960 --> 36:38.600\n I'm gonna speak for myself and say that\n\n36:38.600 --> 36:40.120\n I grew up in an alcoholic home,\n\n36:40.120 --> 36:41.440\n I identify as a codependent,\n\n36:41.440 --> 36:43.280\n talked about this stuff before,\n\n36:43.280 --> 36:45.360\n but for me it's very hard to be in a relationship\n\n36:45.360 --> 36:47.600\n with a human being without feeling like\n\n36:47.600 --> 36:50.760\n I need to perform in some way or deliver in some way,\n\n36:50.760 --> 36:51.920\n and I don't know if that's just the people\n\n36:51.920 --> 36:56.520\n I've been in a relationship with or me or my brokenness,\n\n36:56.520 --> 37:00.720\n but I do think, this is gonna sound really\n\n37:01.960 --> 37:04.160\n negative and pessimistic,\n\n37:04.160 --> 37:07.200\n but I do think a lot of our relationships are projection\n\n37:07.200 --> 37:09.600\n and a lot of our relationships are performance,\n\n37:09.600 --> 37:12.280\n and I don't think I really understood that\n\n37:12.280 --> 37:15.280\n until I worked with horses.\n\n37:15.280 --> 37:18.080\n And most communication with human is nonverbal, right?\n\n37:18.080 --> 37:19.920\n I can say like, I love you,\n\n37:19.920 --> 37:22.000\n but you don't think I love you, right?\n\n37:22.000 --> 37:24.280\n Whereas with animals it's very direct.\n\n37:24.280 --> 37:26.840\n It's all physical, it's all energy.\n\n37:26.840 --> 37:28.520\n I feel like that with robots too.\n\n37:28.520 --> 37:29.800\n It feels very,\n\n37:32.760 --> 37:35.280\n how I say something doesn't matter.\n\n37:35.280 --> 37:36.920\n My inflection doesn't really matter.\n\n37:36.920 --> 37:40.280\n And you thinking that my tone is disrespectful,\n\n37:40.280 --> 37:42.160\n like you're not filtering it through all\n\n37:42.160 --> 37:43.800\n of the bad relationships you've been in,\n\n37:43.800 --> 37:44.840\n you're not filtering it through\n\n37:44.840 --> 37:45.880\n the way your mom talked to you,\n\n37:45.880 --> 37:47.760\n you're not getting triggered.\n\n37:47.760 --> 37:49.400\n I find that for the most part,\n\n37:49.400 --> 37:51.000\n people don't always receive things\n\n37:51.000 --> 37:53.680\n the way that you intend them to or the way intended,\n\n37:53.680 --> 37:56.120\n and that makes relationships really murky.\n\n37:56.120 --> 37:57.480\n So the relationships with animals\n\n37:57.480 --> 38:00.680\n and relationship with the robots is they are now,\n\n38:00.680 --> 38:03.120\n you kind of implied that that's more healthy.\n\n38:05.240 --> 38:08.080\n Can you have a healthy relationship with other humans?\n\n38:08.080 --> 38:10.120\n Or not healthy, I don't like that word,\n\n38:10.120 --> 38:14.440\n but shouldn't it be, you've talked about codependency,\n\n38:14.440 --> 38:16.640\n maybe you can talk about what is codependency,\n\n38:16.640 --> 38:21.640\n but is that, is the challenges of that,\n\n38:21.640 --> 38:24.520\n the complexity of that necessary for passion,\n\n38:24.520 --> 38:27.160\n for love between humans?\n\n38:27.160 --> 38:29.360\n That's right, you love passion.\n\n38:29.360 --> 38:31.880\n That's a good thing.\n\n38:31.880 --> 38:33.840\n I thought this would be a safe space.\n\n38:33.840 --> 38:38.840\n I got trolled by Rogan for hours on this.\n\n38:39.920 --> 38:42.560\n Look, I am not anti passion.\n\n38:42.560 --> 38:45.240\n I think that I've just maybe been around long enough\n\n38:45.240 --> 38:48.200\n to know that sometimes it's ephemeral\n\n38:48.200 --> 38:53.200\n and that passion is a mixture of a lot of different things,\n\n38:55.360 --> 38:57.640\n adrenaline, which turns into dopamine, cortisol,\n\n38:57.640 --> 39:01.160\n it's a lot of neurochemicals, it's a lot of projection,\n\n39:01.160 --> 39:03.200\n it's a lot of what we've seen in movies,\n\n39:03.200 --> 39:06.160\n it's a lot of, you know, I identify as an addict.\n\n39:06.160 --> 39:08.520\n So for me, sometimes passion is like,\n\n39:08.520 --> 39:10.120\n uh oh, this could be bad.\n\n39:10.120 --> 39:11.520\n And I think we've been so conditioned to believe\n\n39:11.520 --> 39:13.080\n that passion means like your soulmates,\n\n39:13.080 --> 39:14.280\n and I mean, how many times have you had\n\n39:14.280 --> 39:15.600\n a passionate connection with someone\n\n39:15.600 --> 39:18.920\n and then it was a total train wreck?\n\n39:18.920 --> 39:19.760\n The train wreck is interesting.\n\n39:19.760 --> 39:21.080\n How many times exactly?\n\n39:21.080 --> 39:21.920\n Exactly.\n\n39:21.920 --> 39:22.760\n What's a train wreck?\n\n39:22.760 --> 39:24.400\n You just did a lot of math in your head\n\n39:24.400 --> 39:25.320\n in that little moment.\n\n39:25.320 --> 39:26.480\n Counting.\n\n39:26.480 --> 39:28.560\n I mean, what's a train wreck?\n\n39:28.560 --> 39:31.480\n What's a, why is obsession,\n\n39:31.480 --> 39:33.600\n so you described this codependency\n\n39:33.600 --> 39:37.400\n and sort of the idea of attachment,\n\n39:37.400 --> 39:40.240\n over attachment to people who don't deserve\n\n39:40.240 --> 39:45.040\n that kind of attachment as somehow a bad thing\n\n39:45.040 --> 39:47.720\n and I think our society says it's a bad thing.\n\n39:47.720 --> 39:49.600\n It probably is a bad thing.\n\n39:49.600 --> 39:52.560\n Like a delicious burger is a bad thing.\n\n39:52.560 --> 39:53.400\n I don't know, but.\n\n39:53.400 --> 39:54.280\n Right, oh, that's a good point.\n\n39:54.280 --> 39:56.120\n I think that you're pointing out something really fascinating\n\n39:56.120 --> 39:59.320\n which is like passion, if you go into it knowing\n\n39:59.320 --> 40:01.160\n this is like pizza where it's gonna be delicious\n\n40:01.160 --> 40:03.040\n for two hours and then I don't have to have it again\n\n40:03.040 --> 40:06.360\n for three, if you can have a choice in the passion,\n\n40:06.360 --> 40:09.520\n I define passion as something that is relatively unmanageable\n\n40:09.520 --> 40:12.200\n and something you can't control or stop and start\n\n40:12.200 --> 40:13.720\n with your own volition.\n\n40:13.720 --> 40:16.320\n So maybe we're operating under different definitions.\n\n40:16.320 --> 40:18.840\n If passion is something that like, you know,\n\n40:18.840 --> 40:22.160\n ruins your real marriages and screws up\n\n40:22.160 --> 40:24.280\n your professional life and becomes this thing\n\n40:24.280 --> 40:28.600\n that you're not in control of and becomes addictive,\n\n40:28.600 --> 40:30.560\n I think that's the difference is,\n\n40:30.560 --> 40:32.560\n is it a choice or is it not a choice?\n\n40:32.560 --> 40:35.120\n And if it is a choice, then passion's great.\n\n40:35.120 --> 40:37.360\n But if it's something that like consumes you\n\n40:37.360 --> 40:39.360\n and makes you start making bad decisions\n\n40:39.360 --> 40:41.160\n and clouds your frontal lobe\n\n40:41.160 --> 40:44.040\n and is just all about dopamine\n\n40:44.040 --> 40:46.160\n and not really about the person\n\n40:46.160 --> 40:47.800\n and more about the neurochemical,\n\n40:47.800 --> 40:50.760\n we call it sort of the drug, the internal drug cabinet.\n\n40:50.760 --> 40:52.960\n If it's all just, you're on drugs, that's different,\n\n40:52.960 --> 40:54.960\n you know, cause sometimes you're just on drugs.\n\n40:54.960 --> 40:57.360\n Okay, so there's a philosophical question here.\n\n40:58.440 --> 41:03.320\n So would you rather, and it's interesting for a comedian,\n\n41:03.320 --> 41:07.520\n brilliant comedian to speak so eloquently\n\n41:07.520 --> 41:09.480\n about a balanced life.\n\n41:09.480 --> 41:12.040\n I kind of argue against this point.\n\n41:12.040 --> 41:13.520\n There's such an obsession of creating\n\n41:13.520 --> 41:18.080\n this healthy lifestyle now, psychologically speaking.\n\n41:18.080 --> 41:22.040\n You know, I'm a fan of the idea that you sort of fly high\n\n41:22.040 --> 41:26.480\n and you crash and die at 27 is also a possible life.\n\n41:26.480 --> 41:27.960\n And it's not one we should judge\n\n41:27.960 --> 41:30.680\n because I think there's moments of greatness.\n\n41:30.680 --> 41:32.120\n I talked to Olympic athletes\n\n41:32.120 --> 41:34.280\n where some of their greatest moments\n\n41:34.280 --> 41:36.560\n are achieved in their early 20s.\n\n41:36.560 --> 41:39.840\n And the rest of their life is in the kind of fog\n\n41:39.840 --> 41:41.920\n of almost of a depression because they can never.\n\n41:41.920 --> 41:44.240\n Because they're based on their physical prowess, right?\n\n41:44.240 --> 41:46.400\n Physical prowess and they'll never,\n\n41:46.400 --> 41:50.200\n so that, so they're watching their physical prowess fade\n\n41:50.200 --> 41:54.680\n and they'll never achieve the kind of height,\n\n41:54.680 --> 41:58.240\n not just physical, of just emotion, of.\n\n41:58.240 --> 42:01.760\n Well, the max number of neurochemicals.\n\n42:01.760 --> 42:04.680\n And you also put your money on the wrong horse.\n\n42:04.680 --> 42:06.360\n That's where I would just go like,\n\n42:06.360 --> 42:10.120\n oh yeah, if you're doing a job where you peak at 22,\n\n42:10.120 --> 42:12.320\n the rest of your life is gonna be hard.\n\n42:12.320 --> 42:15.120\n That idea is considering the notion\n\n42:15.120 --> 42:17.480\n that you wanna optimize some kind of,\n\n42:17.480 --> 42:19.280\n but we're all gonna die soon.\n\n42:19.280 --> 42:20.120\n What?\n\n42:21.840 --> 42:23.280\n Now you tell me.\n\n42:23.280 --> 42:26.800\n I've immortalized myself, so I'm gonna be fine.\n\n42:26.800 --> 42:28.240\n See, you're almost like,\n\n42:28.240 --> 42:32.160\n how many Oscar winning movies can I direct\n\n42:32.160 --> 42:34.040\n by the time I'm 100?\n\n42:34.040 --> 42:35.800\n How many this and that?\n\n42:35.800 --> 42:38.080\n But you know, there's a night, you know,\n\n42:38.080 --> 42:41.200\n it's all, life is short, relatively speaking.\n\n42:41.200 --> 42:42.600\n I know, but it can also come in different ways.\n\n42:42.600 --> 42:45.120\n You go, life is short, play hard,\n\n42:45.120 --> 42:47.640\n fall in love as much as you can, run into walls.\n\n42:47.640 --> 42:49.400\n I would also go, life is short,\n\n42:49.400 --> 42:53.760\n don't deplete yourself on things that aren't sustainable\n\n42:53.760 --> 42:56.560\n and that you can't keep, you know?\n\n42:56.560 --> 42:59.720\n So I think everyone gets dopamine from different places.\n\n42:59.720 --> 43:01.720\n Everyone has meaning from different places.\n\n43:01.720 --> 43:04.520\n I look at the fleeting passionate relationships\n\n43:04.520 --> 43:06.800\n I've had in the past and I don't like,\n\n43:06.800 --> 43:07.880\n I don't have pride in that.\n\n43:07.880 --> 43:10.400\n I think that you have to decide what, you know,\n\n43:10.400 --> 43:11.240\n helps you sleep at night.\n\n43:11.240 --> 43:13.480\n For me, it's pride and feeling like I behave\n\n43:13.480 --> 43:14.480\n with grace and integrity.\n\n43:14.480 --> 43:16.040\n That's just me personally.\n\n43:16.040 --> 43:17.640\n Everyone can go like, yeah,\n\n43:17.640 --> 43:20.960\n I slept with all the hot chicks in Italy I could\n\n43:20.960 --> 43:23.440\n and I, you know, did all the whatever,\n\n43:23.440 --> 43:25.040\n like whatever you value,\n\n43:25.040 --> 43:26.560\n we're allowed to value different things.\n\n43:26.560 --> 43:28.040\n Yeah, we're talking about Brian Callan.\n\n43:28.040 --> 43:32.560\n Brian Callan has lived his life to the fullest,\n\n43:32.560 --> 43:33.560\n to say the least.\n\n43:33.560 --> 43:36.360\n But I think that it's just for me personally,\n\n43:36.360 --> 43:38.800\n I, and this could be like my workaholism\n\n43:38.800 --> 43:41.520\n or my achievementism,\n\n43:41.520 --> 43:45.200\n I, if I don't have something to show for something,\n\n43:45.200 --> 43:50.200\n I feel like it's a waste of time or some kind of loss.\n\n43:50.240 --> 43:52.560\n I'm in a 12 step program and the third step would say,\n\n43:52.560 --> 43:54.080\n there's no such thing as waste of time\n\n43:54.080 --> 43:56.800\n and everything happens exactly as it should\n\n43:56.800 --> 43:59.440\n and whatever, that's a way to just sort of keep us sane\n\n43:59.440 --> 44:01.800\n so we don't grieve too much and beat ourselves up\n\n44:01.800 --> 44:04.600\n over past mistakes, there's no such thing as mistakes,\n\n44:04.600 --> 44:05.720\n dah, dah, dah.\n\n44:05.720 --> 44:10.600\n But I think passion is, I think it's so life affirming\n\n44:10.600 --> 44:13.000\n and one of the few things that maybe people like us\n\n44:13.000 --> 44:14.840\n makes us feel awake and seen\n\n44:14.840 --> 44:19.840\n and we just have such a high threshold for adrenaline.\n\n44:20.480 --> 44:22.720\n You know, I mean, you are a fighter, right?\n\n44:22.720 --> 44:24.000\n Yeah, okay, so yeah,\n\n44:24.000 --> 44:28.680\n so you have a very high tolerance for adrenaline\n\n44:28.680 --> 44:30.360\n and I think that Olympic athletes,\n\n44:30.360 --> 44:33.600\n the amount of adrenaline they get from performing,\n\n44:33.600 --> 44:34.680\n it's very hard to follow that.\n\n44:34.680 --> 44:36.480\n It's like when guys come back from the military\n\n44:36.480 --> 44:38.080\n and they have depression.\n\n44:38.080 --> 44:40.600\n It's like, do you miss bullets flying at you?\n\n44:40.600 --> 44:42.760\n Yeah, kind of because of that adrenaline\n\n44:42.760 --> 44:45.040\n which turned into dopamine and the camaraderie.\n\n44:45.040 --> 44:46.480\n I mean, there's people that speak much better\n\n44:46.480 --> 44:48.360\n about this than I do.\n\n44:48.360 --> 44:50.680\n But I just, I'm obsessed with neurology\n\n44:50.680 --> 44:54.080\n and I'm just obsessed with sort of the lies we tell ourselves\n\n44:54.080 --> 44:57.040\n in order to justify getting neurochemicals.\n\n44:57.040 --> 45:00.320\n You've done actually quite, done a lot of thinking\n\n45:00.320 --> 45:01.880\n and talking about neurology\n\n45:01.880 --> 45:04.160\n and just kind of look at human behavior\n\n45:04.160 --> 45:07.800\n through the lens of looking at how our actually,\n\n45:07.800 --> 45:09.120\n chemically our brain works.\n\n45:09.120 --> 45:10.880\n So what, first of all,\n\n45:10.880 --> 45:15.360\n why did you connect with that idea and what have you,\n\n45:15.360 --> 45:17.520\n how has your view of the world changed\n\n45:17.520 --> 45:22.400\n by considering the brain is just a machine?\n\n45:22.400 --> 45:24.520\n You know, I know it probably sounds really nihilistic\n\n45:24.520 --> 45:27.480\n but for me, it's very liberating to know a lot\n\n45:27.480 --> 45:30.040\n about neurochemicals because you don't have to,\n\n45:30.040 --> 45:32.480\n it's like the same thing with like critics,\n\n45:32.480 --> 45:33.880\n like critical reviews.\n\n45:33.880 --> 45:34.720\n If you believe the good,\n\n45:34.720 --> 45:36.080\n you have to believe the bad kind of thing.\n\n45:36.080 --> 45:38.880\n Like, you know, if you believe that your bad choices\n\n45:38.880 --> 45:43.720\n were because of your moral integrity or whatever,\n\n45:43.720 --> 45:44.720\n you have to believe your good ones.\n\n45:44.720 --> 45:46.280\n I just think there's something really liberating\n\n45:46.280 --> 45:48.040\n and going like, oh, that was just adrenaline.\n\n45:48.040 --> 45:48.880\n I just said that thing\n\n45:48.880 --> 45:50.680\n because I was adrenalized and I was scared\n\n45:50.680 --> 45:52.080\n and my amygdala was activated\n\n45:52.080 --> 45:54.360\n and that's why I said you're an asshole and get out.\n\n45:54.360 --> 45:55.880\n And that's, you know, I think,\n\n45:55.880 --> 45:57.960\n I just think it's important to delineate what's nature\n\n45:57.960 --> 45:59.840\n and what's nurture, what is your choice\n\n45:59.840 --> 46:02.000\n and what is just your brain trying to keep you safe.\n\n46:02.000 --> 46:04.520\n I think we forget that even though we have security systems\n\n46:04.520 --> 46:06.360\n and homes and locks on our doors,\n\n46:06.360 --> 46:07.520\n that our brain for the most part\n\n46:07.520 --> 46:09.200\n is just trying to keep us safe all the time.\n\n46:09.200 --> 46:11.320\n It's why we hold grudges, it's why we get angry,\n\n46:11.320 --> 46:14.720\n it's why we get road rage, it's why we do a lot of things.\n\n46:14.720 --> 46:17.240\n And it's also, when I started learning about neurology,\n\n46:17.240 --> 46:19.640\n I started having so much more compassion for other people.\n\n46:19.640 --> 46:21.520\n You know, if someone yelled at me being like,\n\n46:21.520 --> 46:22.920\n fuck you on the road, I'd be like,\n\n46:22.920 --> 46:24.600\n okay, he's producing adrenaline right now\n\n46:24.600 --> 46:27.680\n because we're all going 65 miles an hour\n\n46:27.680 --> 46:30.200\n and our brains aren't really designed\n\n46:30.200 --> 46:33.280\n for this type of stress and he's scared.\n\n46:33.280 --> 46:35.320\n He was scared, you know, so that really helped me\n\n46:35.320 --> 46:38.360\n to have more love for people in my everyday life\n\n46:38.360 --> 46:41.000\n instead of being in fight or flight mode.\n\n46:41.000 --> 46:44.160\n But the, I think more interesting answer to your question\n\n46:44.160 --> 46:45.720\n is that I've had migraines my whole life.\n\n46:45.720 --> 46:49.000\n Like I've suffered with really intense migraines,\n\n46:49.000 --> 46:52.360\n ocular migraines, ones where my arm would go numb\n\n46:52.360 --> 46:55.000\n and I just started having to go to so many doctors\n\n46:55.000 --> 46:58.360\n to learn about it and I started, you know,\n\n46:58.360 --> 47:00.680\n learning that we don't really know that much.\n\n47:00.680 --> 47:03.520\n We know a lot, but it's wild to go into\n\n47:03.520 --> 47:04.840\n one of the best neurologists in the world\n\n47:04.840 --> 47:05.680\n who's like, yeah, we don't know.\n\n47:05.680 --> 47:07.320\n We don't know. We don't know.\n\n47:07.320 --> 47:08.160\n And that fascinated me.\n\n47:08.160 --> 47:10.720\n Except one of the worst pains you can probably have,\n\n47:10.720 --> 47:13.280\n all that stuff, and we don't know the source.\n\n47:13.280 --> 47:14.320\n We don't know the source\n\n47:14.320 --> 47:16.400\n and there is something really fascinating\n\n47:16.400 --> 47:19.480\n about when your left arm starts going numb\n\n47:19.480 --> 47:21.000\n and you start not being able to see\n\n47:21.000 --> 47:22.840\n out of the left side of both your eyes.\n\n47:22.840 --> 47:25.360\n And I remember when the migraines get really bad,\n\n47:25.360 --> 47:26.880\n it's like a mini stroke almost\n\n47:26.880 --> 47:29.880\n and you're able to see words on a page,\n\n47:29.880 --> 47:31.240\n but I can't read them.\n\n47:31.240 --> 47:33.080\n They just look like symbols to me.\n\n47:33.080 --> 47:35.000\n So there's something just really fascinating to me\n\n47:35.000 --> 47:38.280\n about your brain just being able to stop functioning.\n\n47:38.280 --> 47:41.640\n And I, so I just wanted to learn about it, study about it.\n\n47:41.640 --> 47:43.360\n I did all these weird alternative treatments.\n\n47:43.360 --> 47:45.880\n I got this piercing in here that actually works.\n\n47:45.880 --> 47:47.000\n I've tried everything.\n\n47:47.000 --> 47:49.200\n And then both of my parents had strokes.\n\n47:49.200 --> 47:51.040\n So when both of my parents had strokes,\n\n47:51.040 --> 47:54.160\n I became sort of the person who had to decide\n\n47:54.160 --> 47:56.640\n what was gonna happen with their recovery,\n\n47:56.640 --> 47:59.120\n which is just a wild thing to have to deal with it.\n\n47:59.120 --> 48:02.120\n You know, 28 years old when it happened.\n\n48:02.120 --> 48:05.840\n And I started spending basically all day, every day in ICUs\n\n48:05.840 --> 48:08.200\n with neurologists learning about what happened\n\n48:08.200 --> 48:11.120\n to my dad's brain and why he can't move his left arm,\n\n48:11.120 --> 48:12.520\n but he can move his right leg,\n\n48:12.520 --> 48:14.200\n but he can't see out of the, you know.\n\n48:14.200 --> 48:15.960\n And then my mom had another stroke\n\n48:17.000 --> 48:18.040\n in a different part of the brain.\n\n48:18.040 --> 48:19.640\n So I started having to learn\n\n48:19.640 --> 48:21.480\n what parts of the brain did what,\n\n48:21.480 --> 48:23.840\n and so that I wouldn't take their behavior so personally,\n\n48:23.840 --> 48:25.960\n and so that I would be able to manage my expectations\n\n48:25.960 --> 48:27.400\n in terms of their recovery.\n\n48:27.400 --> 48:31.240\n So my mom, because it affected a lot of her frontal lobe,\n\n48:31.240 --> 48:33.080\n changed a lot as a person.\n\n48:33.080 --> 48:34.560\n She was way more emotional.\n\n48:34.560 --> 48:35.760\n She was way more micromanaged.\n\n48:35.760 --> 48:36.960\n She was forgetting certain things.\n\n48:36.960 --> 48:40.320\n So it broke my heart less when I was able to know,\n\n48:40.320 --> 48:42.080\n oh yeah, well, the stroke hit this part of the brain,\n\n48:42.080 --> 48:44.200\n and that's the one that's responsible for short term memory,\n\n48:44.200 --> 48:46.840\n and that's responsible for long term memory, da da da.\n\n48:46.840 --> 48:48.680\n And then my brother just got something\n\n48:48.680 --> 48:50.520\n called viral encephalitis,\n\n48:50.520 --> 48:53.280\n which is an infection inside the brain.\n\n48:53.280 --> 48:56.280\n So it was kind of wild that I was able to go,\n\n48:56.280 --> 48:57.640\n oh, I know exactly what's happening here,\n\n48:57.640 --> 48:59.760\n and I know, you know, so.\n\n48:59.760 --> 49:02.440\n So that's allows you to have some more compassion\n\n49:02.440 --> 49:04.440\n for the struggles that people have,\n\n49:04.440 --> 49:06.560\n but does it take away some of the magic\n\n49:06.560 --> 49:08.800\n for some of the, from the,\n\n49:08.800 --> 49:10.920\n some of the more positive experiences of life?\n\n49:10.920 --> 49:11.920\n Sometimes.\n\n49:11.920 --> 49:15.320\n Sometimes, and I don't, I'm such a control addict\n\n49:15.320 --> 49:18.120\n that, you know, I think our biggest,\n\n49:18.120 --> 49:19.360\n someone like me,\n\n49:19.360 --> 49:21.000\n my biggest dream is to know why someone's doing it.\n\n49:21.000 --> 49:22.240\n That's what standup is.\n\n49:22.240 --> 49:23.440\n It's just trying to figure out why,\n\n49:23.440 --> 49:24.280\n or that's what writing is.\n\n49:24.280 --> 49:25.120\n That's what acting is.\n\n49:25.120 --> 49:25.960\n That's what performing is.\n\n49:25.960 --> 49:27.440\n It's trying to figure out why someone would do something.\n\n49:27.440 --> 49:30.040\n As an actor, you get a piece of, you know, material,\n\n49:30.040 --> 49:32.120\n and you go, this person, why would he say that?\n\n49:32.120 --> 49:33.760\n Why would he, she pick up that cup?\n\n49:33.760 --> 49:35.040\n Why would she walk over here?\n\n49:35.040 --> 49:36.560\n It's really why, why, why, why.\n\n49:36.560 --> 49:38.000\n So I think neurology is,\n\n49:38.000 --> 49:40.320\n if you're trying to figure out human motives\n\n49:40.320 --> 49:41.520\n and why people do what they do,\n\n49:41.520 --> 49:46.080\n it'd be crazy not to understand how neurochemicals motivate us.\n\n49:46.080 --> 49:48.080\n I also have a lot of addiction in my family\n\n49:48.080 --> 49:51.480\n and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness.\n\n49:51.480 --> 49:53.720\n And in order to cope with it,\n\n49:53.720 --> 49:55.640\n you really have to understand that borderline personality\n\n49:55.640 --> 49:58.360\n disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.\n\n49:58.360 --> 50:00.640\n So I have a lot of people I love\n\n50:00.640 --> 50:02.840\n that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism.\n\n50:02.840 --> 50:04.760\n And the first thing they started teaching you\n\n50:04.760 --> 50:05.880\n is it's not a choice.\n\n50:05.880 --> 50:07.360\n These people's dopamine receptors\n\n50:07.360 --> 50:09.640\n don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do.\n\n50:09.640 --> 50:13.200\n Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped, like, you know,\n\n50:13.200 --> 50:17.160\n and that really helped me to navigate dealing,\n\n50:17.160 --> 50:20.240\n loving people that were addicted to substances.\n\n50:20.240 --> 50:24.240\n I want to be careful with this question, but how much?\n\n50:24.240 --> 50:25.320\n Money do you have?\n\n50:25.320 --> 50:26.160\n How much?\n\n50:26.160 --> 50:28.920\n Can I borrow $10?\n\n50:28.920 --> 50:33.920\n Okay, no, is how much control,\n\n50:33.920 --> 50:38.920\n how much, despite the chemical imbalances\n\n50:39.760 --> 50:42.920\n or the biological limitations\n\n50:42.920 --> 50:44.520\n that each of our individual brains have,\n\n50:44.520 --> 50:47.080\n how much mind over matter is there?\n\n50:47.080 --> 50:51.160\n So through things that I've known people\n\n50:51.160 --> 50:53.200\n with clinical depression,\n\n50:53.200 --> 50:55.560\n and so it's always a touchy subject\n\n50:55.560 --> 50:57.680\n to say how much they can really help it.\n\n50:57.680 --> 50:58.520\n Very.\n\n50:59.680 --> 51:01.680\n What can you, yeah, what can you,\n\n51:01.680 --> 51:03.520\n because you've talked about codependency,\n\n51:03.520 --> 51:07.400\n you talked about issues that you struggle through,\n\n51:07.400 --> 51:09.880\n and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey\n\n51:09.880 --> 51:12.840\n of healing and so on, so that's your choice,\n\n51:12.840 --> 51:14.240\n that's your actions.\n\n51:14.240 --> 51:17.720\n So how much can you do to help fight the limitations\n\n51:17.720 --> 51:20.040\n of the neurochemicals in your brain?\n\n51:20.040 --> 51:21.800\n That's such an interesting question,\n\n51:21.800 --> 51:23.440\n and I don't think I'm at all qualified to answer,\n\n51:23.440 --> 51:25.560\n but I'll say what I do know.\n\n51:25.560 --> 51:28.200\n And really quick, just the definition of codependency,\n\n51:28.200 --> 51:29.920\n I think a lot of people think of codependency\n\n51:29.920 --> 51:33.120\n as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know,\n\n51:33.120 --> 51:36.640\n or like, you know, that's not totally off,\n\n51:36.640 --> 51:38.280\n but I think for the most part,\n\n51:38.280 --> 51:39.960\n my favorite definition of codependency\n\n51:39.960 --> 51:42.880\n is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others.\n\n51:42.880 --> 51:44.040\n You grow up in an alcoholic home,\n\n51:44.040 --> 51:45.200\n you grow up around mental illness,\n\n51:45.200 --> 51:46.480\n you grow up in chaos,\n\n51:46.480 --> 51:48.280\n you have a parent that's a narcissist,\n\n51:48.280 --> 51:51.520\n you basically are wired to just people please,\n\n51:51.520 --> 51:54.720\n worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells,\n\n51:54.720 --> 51:56.680\n shape shift to accommodate other people.\n\n51:56.680 --> 52:01.680\n So codependence is a very active wiring issue\n\n52:01.680 --> 52:04.400\n that, you know, doesn't just affect\n\n52:04.400 --> 52:06.920\n your romantic relationships, it affects you being a boss,\n\n52:06.920 --> 52:09.480\n it affects you in the world.\n\n52:09.480 --> 52:11.920\n Online, you know, you get one negative comment\n\n52:11.920 --> 52:14.080\n and it throws you for two weeks.\n\n52:14.080 --> 52:16.080\n You know, it also is linked to eating disorders\n\n52:16.080 --> 52:17.040\n and other kinds of addiction.\n\n52:17.040 --> 52:20.120\n So it's a very big thing,\n\n52:20.120 --> 52:21.920\n and I think a lot of people sometimes only think\n\n52:21.920 --> 52:23.400\n that it's in a romantic relationship,\n\n52:23.400 --> 52:25.840\n so I always feel the need to say that.\n\n52:25.840 --> 52:28.000\n And also one of the reasons I love the idea of robots\n\n52:28.000 --> 52:30.320\n so much because you don't have to walk on eggshells\n\n52:30.320 --> 52:31.480\n around them, you don't have to worry\n\n52:31.480 --> 52:33.240\n they're gonna get mad at you yet,\n\n52:33.240 --> 52:36.840\n but there's no, codependents are hypersensitive\n\n52:36.840 --> 52:39.480\n to the needs and moods of others,\n\n52:39.480 --> 52:42.080\n and it's very exhausting, it's depleting.\n\n52:42.080 --> 52:45.360\n Just one conversation about where we're gonna go to dinner\n\n52:45.360 --> 52:47.200\n is like, do you wanna go get Chinese food?\n\n52:47.200 --> 52:48.360\n We just had Chinese food.\n\n52:48.360 --> 52:50.080\n Well, wait, are you mad?\n\n52:50.080 --> 52:50.920\n Well, no, I didn't mean to,\n\n52:50.920 --> 52:54.880\n and it's just like that codependents live in this,\n\n52:54.880 --> 52:56.560\n everything means something,\n\n52:56.560 --> 53:00.080\n and humans can be very emotionally exhausting.\n\n53:00.080 --> 53:01.120\n Why did you look at me that way?\n\n53:01.120 --> 53:01.960\n What are you thinking about?\n\n53:01.960 --> 53:02.800\n What was that?\n\n53:02.800 --> 53:03.640\n Why'd you check your phone?\n\n53:03.640 --> 53:06.320\n It's a hypersensitivity that can be\n\n53:06.320 --> 53:07.880\n incredibly time consuming,\n\n53:07.880 --> 53:10.720\n which is why I love the idea of robots just subbing in.\n\n53:10.720 --> 53:13.800\n Even, I've had a hard time running TV shows and stuff\n\n53:13.800 --> 53:15.320\n because even asking someone to do something,\n\n53:15.320 --> 53:16.520\n I don't wanna come off like a bitch,\n\n53:16.520 --> 53:18.640\n I'm very concerned about what other people think of me,\n\n53:18.640 --> 53:21.600\n how I'm perceived, which is why I think robots\n\n53:21.600 --> 53:23.840\n will be very beneficial for codependents.\n\n53:23.840 --> 53:25.600\n By the way, just a real quick tangent,\n\n53:25.600 --> 53:29.120\n that skill or flaw, whatever you wanna call it,\n\n53:29.120 --> 53:32.080\n is actually really useful for if you ever do\n\n53:32.080 --> 53:34.600\n start your own podcast for interviewing,\n\n53:34.600 --> 53:36.440\n because you're now kind of obsessed\n\n53:36.440 --> 53:39.200\n about the mindset of others,\n\n53:39.200 --> 53:43.520\n and it makes you a good sort of listener and talker with.\n\n53:43.520 --> 53:48.240\n So I think, what's her name from NPR?\n\n53:48.240 --> 53:49.080\n Terry Gross.\n\n53:49.080 --> 53:50.920\n Terry Gross talked about having that.\n\n53:50.920 --> 53:51.760\n So.\n\n53:51.760 --> 53:53.440\n I don't feel like she has that at all.\n\n53:53.440 --> 53:54.280\n What?\n\n53:54.280 --> 53:56.800\n She worries about other people's feelings?\n\n53:56.800 --> 53:57.640\n Yeah, absolutely.\n\n53:57.640 --> 53:59.560\n Oh, I don't get that at all.\n\n53:59.560 --> 54:01.160\n I mean, you have to put yourself in the mind\n\n54:01.160 --> 54:03.320\n of the person you're speaking with.\n\n54:03.320 --> 54:05.120\n Oh, I see, just in terms of, yeah,\n\n54:05.120 --> 54:06.120\n I am starting a podcast,\n\n54:06.120 --> 54:08.320\n and the reason I haven't is because I'm codependent\n\n54:08.320 --> 54:10.320\n and I'm too worried it's not gonna be perfect.\n\n54:10.320 --> 54:14.240\n So a big codependent adage is perfectionism\n\n54:14.240 --> 54:16.360\n leads to procrastination, which leads to paralysis.\n\n54:16.360 --> 54:18.320\n So how do you, sorry to take a million changes,\n\n54:18.320 --> 54:19.640\n how do you survive on social media?\n\n54:19.640 --> 54:20.960\n Is the exception the evidence?\n\n54:20.960 --> 54:21.800\n Is the exception the evidence?\n\n54:21.800 --> 54:22.640\n Is the exception the evidence?\n\n54:22.640 --> 54:25.160\n To survive on social media, is the exception active?\n\n54:25.160 --> 54:26.560\n But by the way, I took you on a tangent\n\n54:26.560 --> 54:27.800\n and didn't answer your last question\n\n54:27.800 --> 54:29.920\n about how much we can control.\n\n54:29.920 --> 54:32.920\n How much, yeah, we'll return it, or maybe not.\n\n54:32.920 --> 54:33.760\n The answer is we can't.\n\n54:33.760 --> 54:36.240\n Now as a codependent, I'm, okay, good.\n\n54:36.240 --> 54:38.160\n We can, but, but, you know,\n\n54:38.160 --> 54:39.880\n one of the things that I'm fascinated by is,\n\n54:39.880 --> 54:40.960\n you know, the first thing you learn\n\n54:40.960 --> 54:43.520\n when you go into 12 step programs or addiction recovery\n\n54:43.520 --> 54:45.200\n or any of this is, you know,\n\n54:45.200 --> 54:47.840\n genetics loads the gun, environment pulls the trigger.\n\n54:47.840 --> 54:50.520\n And there's certain parts of your genetics\n\n54:50.520 --> 54:51.560\n you cannot control.\n\n54:51.560 --> 54:54.240\n I come from a lot of alcoholism.\n\n54:54.240 --> 54:59.240\n I come from, you know, a lot of mental illness.\n\n54:59.880 --> 55:01.680\n There's certain things I cannot control\n\n55:01.680 --> 55:04.000\n and a lot of things that maybe we don't even know yet\n\n55:04.000 --> 55:04.840\n what we can and can't\n\n55:04.840 --> 55:06.720\n because of how little we actually know about the brain.\n\n55:06.720 --> 55:08.600\n But we also talk about the warrior spirit.\n\n55:08.600 --> 55:12.080\n And there are some people that have that warrior spirit\n\n55:12.080 --> 55:15.280\n and we don't necessarily know what that engine is,\n\n55:15.280 --> 55:18.000\n whether it's you get dopamine from succeeding\n\n55:18.000 --> 55:21.160\n or achieving or martyring yourself\n\n55:21.160 --> 55:24.920\n or the attention you get from growing.\n\n55:24.920 --> 55:25.800\n So a lot of people are like,\n\n55:25.800 --> 55:29.080\n oh, this person can edify themselves and overcome,\n\n55:29.080 --> 55:32.280\n but if you're getting attention from improving yourself,\n\n55:32.280 --> 55:34.520\n you're gonna keep wanting to do that.\n\n55:34.520 --> 55:37.200\n So that is something that helps a lot of,\n\n55:37.200 --> 55:38.560\n in terms of changing your brain.\n\n55:38.560 --> 55:40.400\n If you talk about changing your brain to people\n\n55:40.400 --> 55:42.880\n and talk about what you're doing to overcome set obstacles,\n\n55:42.880 --> 55:44.560\n you're gonna get more attention from them,\n\n55:44.560 --> 55:46.800\n which is gonna fire off your reward system\n\n55:46.800 --> 55:48.400\n and then you're gonna keep doing it.\n\n55:48.400 --> 55:50.280\n Yeah, so you can leverage that momentum.\n\n55:50.280 --> 55:52.640\n So this is why in any 12 step program,\n\n55:52.640 --> 55:55.120\n you go into a room and you talk about your progress\n\n55:55.120 --> 55:57.080\n because then everyone claps for you.\n\n55:57.080 --> 55:58.760\n And then you're more motivated to keep going.\n\n55:58.760 --> 56:00.160\n So that's why we say you're only as sick\n\n56:00.160 --> 56:01.200\n as the secrets you keep,\n\n56:01.200 --> 56:03.640\n because if you keep things secret,\n\n56:03.640 --> 56:06.080\n there's no one guiding you to go in a certain direction.\n\n56:06.080 --> 56:07.080\n It's based on, right?\n\n56:07.080 --> 56:10.360\n We're sort of designed to get approval from the tribe\n\n56:10.360 --> 56:11.600\n or from a group of people\n\n56:11.600 --> 56:14.600\n because our brain translates it to safety.\n\n56:14.600 --> 56:15.440\n So, you know.\n\n56:15.440 --> 56:17.640\n And in that case, the tribe is a positive one\n\n56:17.640 --> 56:19.520\n that helps you go in a positive direction.\n\n56:19.520 --> 56:21.240\n So that's why it's so important to go into a room\n\n56:21.240 --> 56:25.080\n and also say, hey, I wanted to use drugs today.\n\n56:25.080 --> 56:26.440\n And people go, hmm.\n\n56:26.440 --> 56:27.440\n They go, me too.\n\n56:27.440 --> 56:28.600\n And you feel less alone\n\n56:28.600 --> 56:30.400\n and you feel less like you're, you know,\n\n56:30.400 --> 56:32.760\n have been castigated from the pack or whatever.\n\n56:32.760 --> 56:35.080\n And then you say, and you get a chip\n\n56:35.080 --> 56:37.600\n when you haven't drank for 30 days or 60 days or whatever.\n\n56:37.600 --> 56:38.640\n You get little rewards.\n\n56:38.640 --> 56:43.240\n So talking about a pack that's not at all healthy or good,\n\n56:43.240 --> 56:46.280\n but in fact is often toxic, social media.\n\n56:46.280 --> 56:47.680\n So you're one of my favorite people\n\n56:47.680 --> 56:52.440\n on Twitter and Instagram to sort of just both the comedy\n\n56:52.440 --> 56:54.440\n and the insight and just fun.\n\n56:54.440 --> 56:55.760\n How do you prevent social media\n\n56:55.760 --> 56:57.240\n from destroying your mental health?\n\n56:57.240 --> 56:58.080\n I haven't.\n\n56:59.560 --> 57:00.440\n I haven't.\n\n57:00.440 --> 57:03.160\n It's the next big epidemic, isn't it?\n\n57:05.720 --> 57:06.600\n I don't think I have.\n\n57:06.600 --> 57:08.680\n I don't think.\n\n57:08.680 --> 57:10.760\n Is moderation the answer?\n\n57:10.760 --> 57:14.360\n Maybe, but you can do a lot of damage in a moderate way.\n\n57:14.360 --> 57:17.120\n I mean, I guess, again, it depends on your goals, you know?\n\n57:17.120 --> 57:20.840\n And I think for me, the way that my addiction\n\n57:20.840 --> 57:23.080\n to social media, I'm happy to call it an addiction.\n\n57:23.080 --> 57:24.960\n I mean, and I define it as an addiction\n\n57:24.960 --> 57:26.280\n because it stops being a choice.\n\n57:26.280 --> 57:29.240\n There are times I just reach over and I'm like, that was.\n\n57:29.240 --> 57:30.080\n Yeah, that was weird.\n\n57:30.080 --> 57:31.320\n That was weird.\n\n57:31.320 --> 57:33.640\n I'll be driving sometimes and I'll be like, oh my God,\n\n57:33.640 --> 57:36.800\n my arm just went to my phone, you know?\n\n57:36.800 --> 57:37.800\n I can put it down.\n\n57:37.800 --> 57:41.400\n I can take time away from it, but when I do, I get antsy.\n\n57:41.400 --> 57:43.400\n I get restless, irritable, and discontent.\n\n57:43.400 --> 57:45.880\n I mean, that's kind of the definition, isn't it?\n\n57:45.880 --> 57:49.840\n So I think by no means do I have a healthy relationship\n\n57:49.840 --> 57:50.680\n with social media.\n\n57:50.680 --> 57:51.560\n I'm sure there's a way to,\n\n57:51.560 --> 57:54.800\n but I think I'm especially a weirdo in this space\n\n57:54.800 --> 57:56.960\n because it's easy to conflate.\n\n57:56.960 --> 57:58.080\n Is this work?\n\n57:58.080 --> 57:58.920\n Is this not?\n\n57:58.920 --> 58:01.960\n I can always say that it's for work, you know?\n\n58:01.960 --> 58:04.160\n But I mean, don't you get the same kind of thing\n\n58:04.160 --> 58:08.080\n as you get from when a room full of people laugh at your jokes?\n\n58:08.080 --> 58:11.200\n Because I mean, I see, especially the way you do Twitter,\n\n58:11.200 --> 58:13.680\n it's an extension of your comedy in a way.\n\n58:13.680 --> 58:16.000\n So I took a big break from Twitter though,\n\n58:16.000 --> 58:16.840\n a really big break.\n\n58:16.840 --> 58:19.160\n I took like six months off or something for a while\n\n58:19.160 --> 58:20.520\n because it was just like,\n\n58:20.520 --> 58:22.280\n it seemed like it was all kind of politics\n\n58:22.280 --> 58:23.280\n and it was just a little bit,\n\n58:23.280 --> 58:25.000\n it wasn't giving me dopamine\n\n58:25.000 --> 58:28.320\n because there was like this weird, a lot of feedback.\n\n58:28.320 --> 58:30.760\n So I had to take a break from it and then go back to it\n\n58:30.760 --> 58:33.520\n because I felt like I didn't have a healthy relationship.\n\n58:33.520 --> 58:36.160\n Have you ever tried the, I don't know if I believe him,\n\n58:36.160 --> 58:39.480\n but Joe Rogan seems to not read comments.\n\n58:39.480 --> 58:42.560\n Have you, and he's one of the only people at the scale,\n\n58:42.560 --> 58:47.560\n like at your level who at least claims not to read.\n\n58:47.880 --> 58:51.800\n So like, cause you and him swim in this space\n\n58:51.800 --> 58:56.800\n of tense ideas that get the toxic folks riled up.\n\n58:58.720 --> 59:01.080\n I think Rogan, I don't, I don't know.\n\n59:01.080 --> 59:05.360\n I don't, I think he probably looks at YouTube,\n\n59:05.360 --> 59:08.240\n like the likes and the, you know, I think if some things,\n\n59:08.240 --> 59:10.240\n if he doesn't know, I don't know.\n\n59:10.240 --> 59:13.800\n I'm sure he would tell the truth, you know,\n\n59:13.800 --> 59:15.840\n I'm sure he's got people that look at them\n\n59:15.840 --> 59:17.280\n and it's like disgusted, great.\n\n59:17.280 --> 59:20.320\n Or I don't, you know, like, I'm sure he gets it.\n\n59:20.320 --> 59:23.240\n You know, I can't picture him like in the weeds on.\n\n59:23.240 --> 59:24.080\n No, for sure.\n\n59:24.080 --> 59:26.280\n I mean, he's honestly actually saying that I just,\n\n59:26.280 --> 59:28.720\n it's, it's, it's admirable.\n\n59:28.720 --> 59:29.680\n We're addicted to feedback.\n\n59:29.680 --> 59:30.560\n Yeah, we're addicted to feedback.\n\n59:30.560 --> 59:31.960\n I mean, you know, look,\n\n59:31.960 --> 59:36.040\n like I think that our brain is designed to get intel\n\n59:36.040 --> 59:39.560\n on how we're perceived so that we know where we stand,\n\n59:39.560 --> 59:40.400\n right?\n\n59:40.400 --> 59:41.280\n That's our whole deal, right?\n\n59:41.280 --> 59:43.040\n As humans, we want to know where we stand.\n\n59:43.040 --> 59:44.200\n We walk in a room and we go,\n\n59:44.200 --> 59:45.520\n who's the most powerful person in here?\n\n59:45.520 --> 59:47.520\n I got to talk to them and get in their good graces.\n\n59:47.520 --> 59:49.840\n It's just, we're designed to rank ourselves, right?\n\n59:49.840 --> 59:52.840\n And constantly know our rank and social media\n\n59:52.840 --> 59:55.880\n because of you can't figure out your rank\n\n59:55.880 --> 59:58.120\n with 500 million people.\n\n59:58.120 --> 1:00:00.320\n It's possible, you know, so our brain is like,\n\n1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:01.160\n what's my rank?\n\n1:00:01.160 --> 1:00:02.960\n What's my, and especially if we're following people,\n\n1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:05.160\n I think the, the big, the interesting thing,\n\n1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:07.800\n I think I maybe be able to say about this\n\n1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:12.120\n besides my speech impediment is that I did start muting\n\n1:00:12.120 --> 1:00:16.120\n people that rank wildly higher than me\n\n1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:19.000\n because it is just stressful on the brain\n\n1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.040\n to constantly look at people\n\n1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:23.040\n that are incredibly successful.\n\n1:00:23.040 --> 1:00:25.000\n So you keep feeling bad about yourself.\n\n1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.280\n You know, I think that that is like cutting\n\n1:00:27.280 --> 1:00:28.600\n to a certain extent.\n\n1:00:28.600 --> 1:00:30.920\n Just like, look at me looking at all these people\n\n1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:32.040\n that have so much more money than me\n\n1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:33.760\n and so much more success than me.\n\n1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:35.840\n It's making me feel like a failure,\n\n1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:37.600\n even though I don't think I'm a failure,\n\n1:00:37.600 --> 1:00:41.880\n but it's easy to frame it so that I can feel that way.\n\n1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:43.280\n Yeah, that's really interesting,\n\n1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:45.080\n especially if they're close to,\n\n1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:46.880\n like if they're other comedians or something like that,\n\n1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:48.080\n or whatever.\n\n1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:50.440\n That's, it's really disappointing to me.\n\n1:00:50.440 --> 1:00:51.720\n I do the same thing as well.\n\n1:00:51.720 --> 1:00:53.560\n So other successful people that are really close\n\n1:00:53.560 --> 1:00:56.360\n to what I do, it, I don't know,\n\n1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:58.200\n I wish I could just admire.\n\n1:00:58.200 --> 1:00:59.040\n Yeah.\n\n1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:01.360\n And for it not to be a distraction, but.\n\n1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:02.440\n But that's why you are where you are\n\n1:01:02.440 --> 1:01:04.320\n because you don't just admire your competitive\n\n1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:05.240\n and you want to win.\n\n1:01:05.240 --> 1:01:07.480\n So it's also the same thing that bums you out\n\n1:01:07.480 --> 1:01:08.800\n when you look at this as the same reason\n\n1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:09.640\n you are where you are.\n\n1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.480\n So that's why I think it's so important\n\n1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:12.800\n to learn about neurology and addiction\n\n1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:14.080\n because you're able to go like,\n\n1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:15.680\n oh, this same instinct.\n\n1:01:15.680 --> 1:01:17.120\n So I'm very sensitive.\n\n1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:19.480\n And I, and I sometimes don't like that about myself,\n\n1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:21.640\n but I'm like, well, that's the reason I'm able to\n\n1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:22.480\n write good standup.\n\n1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:23.720\n And that's the reason, and that's the reason\n\n1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:25.680\n I'm able to be sensitive to feedback\n\n1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:26.920\n and go, that joke should have been better.\n\n1:01:26.920 --> 1:01:28.040\n I can make that better.\n\n1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:29.480\n So it's the kind of thing where it's like,\n\n1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:31.240\n you have to be really sensitive in your work.\n\n1:01:31.240 --> 1:01:32.320\n And the second you leave,\n\n1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:33.560\n you got to be able to turn it off.\n\n1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:34.840\n It's about developing the muscle,\n\n1:01:34.840 --> 1:01:38.360\n being able to know when to let it be a superpower\n\n1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:41.240\n and when it's going to hold you back and be an obstacle.\n\n1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:44.320\n So I try to not be in that black and white of like,\n\n1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:45.800\n you know, being competitive is bad\n\n1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:47.720\n or being jealous of someone just to go like,\n\n1:01:47.720 --> 1:01:50.240\n oh, there's that thing that makes me really successful\n\n1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:51.440\n in a lot of other ways,\n\n1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:53.280\n but right now it's making me feel bad.\n\n1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.960\n Well, I'm kind of looking to you\n\n1:01:54.960 --> 1:01:58.200\n because you're basically a celebrity,\n\n1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:01.240\n a famous sort of world class comedian.\n\n1:02:01.240 --> 1:02:03.120\n And so I feel like you're the right person\n\n1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.120\n to be one of the key people to define\n\n1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:08.960\n what's the healthy path forward with social media.\n\n1:02:08.960 --> 1:02:12.800\n So I, because we're all trying to figure it out now\n\n1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:16.360\n and it's, I'm curious to see where it evolves.\n\n1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:17.960\n I think you're at the center of that.\n\n1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:20.400\n So like, you know, there's, you know,\n\n1:02:20.400 --> 1:02:22.800\n trying to leave Twitter and then come back and see,\n\n1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:24.080\n can I do this in a healthy way?\n\n1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:25.760\n I mean, you have to keep trying, exploring.\n\n1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.160\n You have to know because it's being, you know,\n\n1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:29.760\n I have a couple answers.\n\n1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:31.600\n I think, you know, I hire a company\n\n1:02:31.600 --> 1:02:33.920\n to do some of my social media for me, you know?\n\n1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:36.280\n So it's also being able to go, okay,\n\n1:02:36.280 --> 1:02:38.360\n I make a certain amount of money by doing this,\n\n1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:40.360\n but now let me be a good business person\n\n1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:42.960\n and say, I'm gonna pay you this amount to run this for me.\n\n1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:45.920\n So I'm not 24 seven in the weeds hashtagging and responding.\n\n1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:47.280\n And just, it's a lot to take on.\n\n1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:48.800\n It's a lot of energy to take on.\n\n1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:51.280\n But at the same time, part of what I think\n\n1:02:51.280 --> 1:02:53.480\n makes me successful on social media if I am,\n\n1:02:53.480 --> 1:02:55.280\n is that people know I'm actually doing it\n\n1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:57.200\n and that I am an engaging and I'm responding\n\n1:02:57.200 --> 1:02:59.600\n and developing a personal relationship\n\n1:02:59.600 --> 1:03:01.080\n with complete strangers.\n\n1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:04.000\n So I think, you know, figuring out that balance\n\n1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.160\n and really approaching it as a business, you know,\n\n1:03:06.160 --> 1:03:07.280\n that's what I try to do.\n\n1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:09.480\n It's not dating, it's not,\n\n1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:11.200\n I try to just be really objective about,\n\n1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:13.400\n okay, here's what's working, here's what's not working.\n\n1:03:13.400 --> 1:03:15.880\n And in terms of taking the break from Twitter,\n\n1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:17.640\n this is a really savage take,\n\n1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:21.720\n but because I don't talk about my politics publicly,\n\n1:03:21.720 --> 1:03:26.040\n being on Twitter right after the last election\n\n1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:27.880\n was not gonna be beneficial\n\n1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:30.280\n because there was gonna be, you had to take a side.\n\n1:03:30.280 --> 1:03:32.360\n You had to be political in order to get\n\n1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:34.400\n any kind of retweets or likes.\n\n1:03:34.400 --> 1:03:37.280\n And I just wasn't interested in doing that\n\n1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:38.720\n because you were gonna lose as many people\n\n1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:39.560\n as you were gonna gain\n\n1:03:39.560 --> 1:03:40.840\n and it was gonna all come clean in the wash.\n\n1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:42.760\n So I was just like, the best thing I can do\n\n1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:47.760\n for me business wise is to just abstain, you know?\n\n1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:52.240\n And you know, the robot, I joke about her replacing me,\n\n1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:55.760\n but she does do half of my social media, you know?\n\n1:03:55.760 --> 1:03:57.960\n Because I don't want people to get sick of me.\n\n1:03:57.960 --> 1:03:59.840\n I don't want to be redundant.\n\n1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:02.440\n There are times when I don't have the time or the energy\n\n1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:03.360\n to make a funny video,\n\n1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:06.160\n but I know she's gonna be compelling and interesting\n\n1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:08.520\n and that's something that you can't see every day, you know?\n\n1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:11.920\n Of course, the humor comes from your,\n\n1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:15.240\n I mean, the cleverness, the wit, the humor comes from you\n\n1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:16.440\n when you film the robot.\n\n1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:17.880\n That's kind of the trick of it.\n\n1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:21.000\n I mean, the robot is not quite there\n\n1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.440\n to do anything funny.\n\n1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:26.680\n The absurdity is revealed through the filmmaker in that case\n\n1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:27.840\n or whoever is interacting,\n\n1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:32.840\n not through the actual robot, you know, being who she is.\n\n1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:37.080\n Let me sort of, love.\n\n1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:37.920\n Okay.\n\n1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:39.600\n How difficult.\n\n1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:40.760\n What is it?\n\n1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:41.600\n What is it?\n\n1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:45.080\n Well, first, an engineering question.\n\n1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:48.080\n I know, I know, you're not an engineer,\n\n1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:52.160\n but how difficult do you think is it to build an AI system\n\n1:04:52.160 --> 1:04:54.280\n that you can have a deep, fulfilling,\n\n1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:56.480\n monogamous relationship with?\n\n1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:59.880\n Sort of replace the human to human relationships\n\n1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:00.800\n that we value?\n\n1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:04.840\n I think anyone can fall in love with anything, you know?\n\n1:05:04.840 --> 1:05:08.360\n Like, how often have you looked back at someone?\n\n1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:11.320\n Like, I ran into someone the other day\n\n1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:12.720\n that I was in love with and I was like,\n\n1:05:12.720 --> 1:05:16.360\n hey, it was like, there was nothing there.\n\n1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:17.880\n There was nothing there.\n\n1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.800\n Like, do you, you know, like, where you're able to go like,\n\n1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:23.720\n oh, that was weird, oh, right, you know?\n\n1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:25.080\n I were able.\n\n1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:27.160\n You mean from a distant past or something like that?\n\n1:05:27.160 --> 1:05:28.720\n Yeah, when you're able to go like,\n\n1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:31.440\n I can't believe we had an incredible connection\n\n1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:35.560\n and now it's just, I do think that people will be in love\n\n1:05:35.560 --> 1:05:39.800\n with robots probably even more deeply with humans\n\n1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:42.520\n because it's like when people mourn their animals,\n\n1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:45.000\n when their animals die, they're always,\n\n1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.760\n it's sometimes harder than mourning a human\n\n1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:50.360\n because you can't go, well, he was kind of an asshole,\n\n1:05:50.360 --> 1:05:52.000\n but like, he didn't pick me up from school.\n\n1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.360\n You know, it's like, you're able to get out\n\n1:05:53.360 --> 1:05:54.280\n of your grief a little bit.\n\n1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:57.400\n You're able to kind of be, oh, he was kind of judgmental\n\n1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:00.320\n or she was kind of, you know, with a robot,\n\n1:06:00.320 --> 1:06:03.640\n there's something so pure about an innocent and impish\n\n1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:07.560\n and childlike about it that I think it probably\n\n1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:11.080\n will be much more conducive to a narcissistic love\n\n1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:15.280\n for sure at that, but it's not like, well, he cheated on,\n\n1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:17.960\n she can't cheat, she can't leave you, she can't, you know?\n\n1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:21.560\n Well, if Bearclaw leaves your life\n\n1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:25.640\n and maybe a new version or somebody else will enter,\n\n1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:27.960\n will you miss Bearclaw?\n\n1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:30.680\n For guys that have these sex robots,\n\n1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:34.380\n they're building a nursing home for the bodies\n\n1:06:34.380 --> 1:06:36.320\n that are now resting\n\n1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:37.940\n because they don't want to part with the bodies\n\n1:06:37.940 --> 1:06:39.720\n because they have such an intense emotional connection\n\n1:06:39.720 --> 1:06:40.840\n to it.\n\n1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:42.840\n I mean, it's kind of like a car club a little bit,\n\n1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:45.000\n you know, like it's, you know,\n\n1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.380\n but I'm not saying this is right.\n\n1:06:47.380 --> 1:06:50.020\n I'm not saying it's cool, it's weird, it's creepy,\n\n1:06:50.020 --> 1:06:53.820\n but we do anthropomorphize things with faces\n\n1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:56.640\n and we do develop emotional connections to things.\n\n1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:59.320\n I mean, there's certain, have you ever tried to like throw,\n\n1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:00.800\n I can't even throw away my teddy bear\n\n1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:01.800\n from when I was a kid.\n\n1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:04.340\n It's a piece of trash and it's upstairs.\n\n1:07:04.340 --> 1:07:06.660\n Like, it's just like, why can't I throw that away?\n\n1:07:06.660 --> 1:07:08.200\n It's bizarre, you know,\n\n1:07:08.200 --> 1:07:10.120\n and there's something kind of beautiful about that.\n\n1:07:10.120 --> 1:07:13.120\n There's something, it gives me hope in humans\n\n1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:15.720\n because I see humans do such horrific things all the time\n\n1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:18.340\n and maybe I'm too, I see too much of it, frankly,\n\n1:07:18.340 --> 1:07:20.240\n but there's something kind of beautiful\n\n1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:24.360\n about the way we're able to have emotional connections\n\n1:07:24.360 --> 1:07:29.200\n to objects, which, you know, a lot of,\n\n1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:32.160\n I mean, it's kind of specifically, I think, Western, right?\n\n1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:34.880\n That we don't see objects as having souls,\n\n1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:36.800\n like that's kind of specifically us,\n\n1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:39.720\n but I don't think it's so much\n\n1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:43.420\n that we're objectifying humans with these sex robots.\n\n1:07:43.420 --> 1:07:45.680\n We're kind of humanizing objects, right?\n\n1:07:45.680 --> 1:07:47.080\n So there's something kind of fascinating\n\n1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:48.160\n in our ability to do that\n\n1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:50.080\n because a lot of us don't humanize humans.\n\n1:07:50.080 --> 1:07:52.880\n So it's just a weird little place to play in\n\n1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:54.980\n and I think a lot of people, I mean,\n\n1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:57.760\n a lot of people will be marrying these things is my guess.\n\n1:07:57.760 --> 1:08:00.640\n So you've asked the question, let me ask it of you.\n\n1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:01.920\n So what is love?\n\n1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:05.720\n You have a bit of a brilliant definition of love\n\n1:08:05.720 --> 1:08:07.840\n as being willing to die for someone\n\n1:08:07.840 --> 1:08:10.600\n who you yourself want to kill.\n\n1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.240\n So that's kind of fun.\n\n1:08:12.240 --> 1:08:13.980\n First of all, that's brilliant.\n\n1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:16.480\n That's a really good definition.\n\n1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:18.280\n I think it'll stick with me for a long time.\n\n1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:19.840\n This is how little of a romantic I am.\n\n1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:21.400\n A plane went by when you said that\n\n1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:24.960\n and my brain is like, you're gonna need to rerecord that.\n\n1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.400\n And I want you to get into post\n\n1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.160\n and then not be able to use that.\n\n1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:32.400\n And I'm a romantic as I...\n\n1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:33.600\n Don't mean to ruin the moment.\n\n1:08:33.600 --> 1:08:35.640\n Actually, I can not be conscious of the fact\n\n1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:38.240\n that I heard the plane and it made me feel like\n\n1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.200\n how amazing it is that we live in a world of planes.\n\n1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:46.200\n And I just went, why haven't we fucking evolved past planes\n\n1:08:47.040 --> 1:08:49.080\n and why can't they make them quieter?\n\n1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:50.480\n Yeah.\n\n1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:51.320\n Well, yes.\n\n1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:54.440\n My definition of love?\n\n1:08:54.440 --> 1:08:57.800\n What, yeah, what's your sort of the more serious note?\n\n1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:00.080\n Consistently producing dopamine for a long time.\n\n1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:05.040\n Consistent output of oxytocin with the same person.\n\n1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:08.240\n Dopamine is a positive thing.\n\n1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:09.520\n What about the negative?\n\n1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:13.200\n What about the fear and the insecurity, the longing,\n\n1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:16.520\n anger, all that kind of stuff?\n\n1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:17.840\n I think that's part of love.\n\n1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:22.000\n I think that love brings out the best in you,\n\n1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.040\n but it also, if you don't get angry and upset,\n\n1:09:24.040 --> 1:09:26.880\n it's, I don't know, I think that that's part of it.\n\n1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:29.720\n I think we have this idea that love has to be like really\n\n1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:31.080\n placid or something.\n\n1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:34.160\n I only saw stormy relationships growing up,\n\n1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:36.920\n so I don't have a judgment\n\n1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:38.600\n on how a relationship should look,\n\n1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:43.600\n but I do think that this idea that love has to be eternal\n\n1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:48.800\n is really destructive, is really destructive\n\n1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:53.680\n and self defeating and a big source of stress for people.\n\n1:09:53.680 --> 1:09:55.640\n I mean, I'm still figuring out love.\n\n1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:57.280\n I think we all kind of are,\n\n1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:59.400\n but I do kind of stand by that definition.\n\n1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:03.600\n And I think that, I think for me,\n\n1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:06.280\n love is like just being able to be authentic with somebody.\n\n1:10:06.280 --> 1:10:07.800\n It's very simple, I know,\n\n1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:10.120\n but I think for me it's about not feeling pressure\n\n1:10:10.120 --> 1:10:11.960\n to have to perform or impress somebody,\n\n1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:16.560\n just feeling truly like accepted unconditionally by someone.\n\n1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:19.160\n Although I do believe love should be conditional.\n\n1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:22.880\n That might be a hot take.\n\n1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:24.280\n I think everything should be conditional.\n\n1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:27.080\n I think if someone's behavior,\n\n1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:28.880\n I don't think love should just be like,\n\n1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:30.960\n I'm in love with you, now behave however you want forever.\n\n1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:31.880\n This is unconditional.\n\n1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:35.320\n I think love is a daily action.\n\n1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:38.120\n It's not something you just like get tenure on\n\n1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:40.000\n and then get to behave however you want\n\n1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.880\n because we said I love you 10 years ago.\n\n1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:44.560\n It's a daily, it's a verb.\n\n1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:46.120\n Well, there's some things that are,\n\n1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.080\n you see, if you explicitly make it clear\n\n1:10:49.080 --> 1:10:50.400\n that it's conditional,\n\n1:10:50.400 --> 1:10:52.520\n it takes away some of the magic of it.\n\n1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:55.360\n So there's certain stories we tell ourselves\n\n1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:57.200\n that we don't want to make explicit about love.\n\n1:10:57.200 --> 1:10:59.160\n I don't know, maybe that's the wrong way to think of it.\n\n1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:02.640\n Maybe you want to be explicit in relationships.\n\n1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:04.640\n I also think love is a business decision.\n\n1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.000\n Like I do in a good way.\n\n1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:11.160\n Like I think that love is not just\n\n1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:12.600\n when you're across from somebody.\n\n1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:15.720\n It's when I go to work, can I focus?\n\n1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:16.560\n Am I worried about you?\n\n1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.040\n Am I stressed out about you?\n\n1:11:18.040 --> 1:11:19.400\n You're not responding to me.\n\n1:11:19.400 --> 1:11:20.440\n You're not reliable.\n\n1:11:20.440 --> 1:11:23.200\n Like I think that being in a relationship,\n\n1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:24.280\n the kind of love that I would want\n\n1:11:24.280 --> 1:11:26.920\n is the kind of relationship where when we're not together,\n\n1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:30.600\n it's not draining me, causing me stress, making me worry,\n\n1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:35.600\n and sometimes passion, that word, we get murky about it.\n\n1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:37.320\n But I think it's also like,\n\n1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:38.560\n I can be the best version of myself\n\n1:11:38.560 --> 1:11:40.080\n when the person's not around.\n\n1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:42.680\n And I don't have to feel abandoned or scared\n\n1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:43.960\n or any of these kinds of other things.\n\n1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:48.800\n So it's like love, for me, I think it's a Flaubert quote\n\n1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:49.800\n and I'm going to butcher it.\n\n1:11:49.800 --> 1:11:53.320\n But I think it's like, be boring in your personal life\n\n1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:54.800\n so you can be violent and take risks\n\n1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:55.760\n in your professional life.\n\n1:11:55.760 --> 1:11:56.600\n Is that it?\n\n1:11:56.600 --> 1:11:57.480\n I got it wrong.\n\n1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:58.320\n Something like that.\n\n1:11:58.320 --> 1:12:01.280\n But I do think that it's being able to align values\n\n1:12:01.280 --> 1:12:02.960\n in a way to where you can also thrive\n\n1:12:02.960 --> 1:12:04.600\n outside of the relationship.\n\n1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:06.160\n Some of the most successful people I know\n\n1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:10.040\n are those sort of happily married and have kids and so on.\n\n1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:10.880\n It's always funny.\n\n1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:11.800\n It can be boring.\n\n1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:13.160\n Boring's okay.\n\n1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:14.400\n Boring is serenity.\n\n1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:16.440\n And it's funny how those elements\n\n1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:18.320\n actually make you much more productive.\n\n1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:19.640\n I don't understand the.\n\n1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:21.080\n I don't think relationships should drain you\n\n1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:23.360\n and take away energy that you could be using\n\n1:12:23.360 --> 1:12:25.720\n to create things that generate pride.\n\n1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:26.560\n Okay.\n\n1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:28.600\n Have you said your relationship of love yet?\n\n1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:31.360\n Have you said your definition of love?\n\n1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:32.600\n My definition of love?\n\n1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:35.520\n No, I did not say it.\n\n1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:36.680\n We're out of time.\n\n1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:37.520\n No.\n\n1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.760\n When you have a podcast, maybe you can invite me on.\n\n1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:42.600\n Oh no, I already did.\n\n1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.000\n You're doing it.\n\n1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:46.360\n We've already talked about this.\n\n1:12:46.360 --> 1:12:49.440\n And because I also have codependency, I have to say yes.\n\n1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:50.280\n No, yeah.\n\n1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:52.240\n No, I know, I'm trapping you.\n\n1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:53.080\n You owe me now.\n\n1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:58.080\n Actually, I wondered whether when I asked\n\n1:12:58.240 --> 1:13:01.680\n if we could talk today, after sort of doing more research\n\n1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:04.600\n and reading some of your book, I started to wonder,\n\n1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:07.000\n did you just feel pressured to say yes?\n\n1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.320\n Yes, of course.\n\n1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:10.160\n Good.\n\n1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:11.000\n But I'm a fan of yours, too.\n\n1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:11.840\n Okay, awesome.\n\n1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:13.360\n No, I actually, because I am codependent,\n\n1:13:13.360 --> 1:13:14.880\n but I'm in recovery for codependence,\n\n1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:17.600\n so I actually do, I don't do anything I don't wanna do.\n\n1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:20.360\n You really, you go out of your way to say no.\n\n1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:21.200\n What's that?\n\n1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:22.680\n I say no all the time.\n\n1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:23.520\n Good.\n\n1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:24.360\n I'm trying to learn that as well.\n\n1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:25.200\n I moved this a couple, remember,\n\n1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:26.040\n I moved it from one to two.\n\n1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:26.880\n Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:27.960\n Just to, yeah, just to.\n\n1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:28.800\n Yeah, just to let you know.\n\n1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:29.640\n I love it.\n\n1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:31.920\n How recovered I am, and I'm not codependent.\n\n1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:34.600\n But I don't do anything I don't wanna do.\n\n1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:35.920\n Yeah, you're ahead of me on that.\n\n1:13:35.920 --> 1:13:36.880\n Okay.\n\n1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:37.720\n So do you.\n\n1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:38.560\n You're like, I don't even wanna be here.\n\n1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:43.400\n Do you think about your mortality?\n\n1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:46.920\n Yes, it is a big part of how I was able\n\n1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:49.040\n to sort of like kickstart my codependence recovery.\n\n1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:50.400\n My dad passed a couple years ago,\n\n1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.040\n and when you have someone close to you in your life die,\n\n1:13:53.040 --> 1:13:55.320\n everything gets real clear,\n\n1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:57.720\n in terms of how we're a speck of dust\n\n1:13:57.720 --> 1:14:00.800\n who's only here for a certain amount of time.\n\n1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:02.320\n What do you think is the meaning of it all?\n\n1:14:02.320 --> 1:14:05.160\n Like what the speck of dust,\n\n1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:09.480\n what's maybe in your own life, what's the goal,\n\n1:14:09.480 --> 1:14:13.280\n the purpose of your existence?\n\n1:14:13.280 --> 1:14:15.200\n Is there one?\n\n1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:17.280\n Well, you're exceptionally ambitious.\n\n1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:19.080\n You've created some incredible things\n\n1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:21.600\n in different disciplines.\n\n1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:23.520\n Yeah, we're all just managing our terror\n\n1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:24.520\n because we know we're gonna die.\n\n1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:26.320\n So we create and build all these things\n\n1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:29.440\n and rituals and religions and robots\n\n1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:31.760\n and whatever we need to do to just distract ourselves\n\n1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:36.160\n from imminent rotting, we're rotting.\n\n1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:37.120\n We're all dying.\n\n1:14:37.120 --> 1:14:42.120\n And I got very into terror management theory\n\n1:14:42.520 --> 1:14:45.120\n when my dad died and it resonated, it helped me.\n\n1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:46.560\n And everyone's got their own religion\n\n1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:50.280\n or sense of purpose or thing that distracts them\n\n1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:53.320\n from the horrors of being human.\n\n1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:56.080\n What's the terror management theory?\n\n1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:57.360\n Terror management is basically the idea\n\n1:14:57.360 --> 1:14:58.640\n that since we're the only animal\n\n1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:00.360\n that knows they're gonna die,\n\n1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:03.480\n we have to basically distract ourselves\n\n1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:08.480\n with awards and achievements and games and whatever,\n\n1:15:09.600 --> 1:15:11.920\n just in order to distract ourselves\n\n1:15:11.920 --> 1:15:14.560\n from the terror we would feel if we really processed\n\n1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:16.920\n the fact that we could not only, we are gonna die,\n\n1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:18.440\n but also could die at any minute\n\n1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:19.800\n because we're only superficially\n\n1:15:19.800 --> 1:15:21.200\n at the top of the food chain.\n\n1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:26.160\n And technically we're at the top of the food chain\n\n1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:29.320\n if we have houses and guns and stuff machines,\n\n1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:32.400\n but if me and a lion are in the woods together,\n\n1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:33.800\n most things could kill us.\n\n1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.400\n I mean, a bee can kill some people,\n\n1:15:35.400 --> 1:15:38.640\n like something this big can kill a lot of humans.\n\n1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:41.480\n So it's basically just to manage the terror\n\n1:15:41.480 --> 1:15:43.040\n that we all would feel if we were able\n\n1:15:43.040 --> 1:15:45.200\n to really be awake.\n\n1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:46.840\n Cause we're mostly zombies, right?\n\n1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:51.520\n Job, school, religion, go to sleep, drink, football,\n\n1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:54.480\n relationship, dopamine, love, you know,\n\n1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:57.000\n we're kind of just like trudging along\n\n1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:58.480\n like zombies for the most part.\n\n1:15:58.480 --> 1:15:59.800\n And then I think.\n\n1:15:59.800 --> 1:16:02.360\n That fear of death adds some motivation.\n\n1:16:02.360 --> 1:16:03.440\n Yes.\n\n1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:06.080\n Well, I think I speak for a lot of people\n\n1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:08.240\n in saying that I can't wait to see\n\n1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:13.240\n what your terror creates in the next few years.\n\n1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:14.840\n I'm a huge fan.\n\n1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:16.560\n Whitney, thank you so much for
